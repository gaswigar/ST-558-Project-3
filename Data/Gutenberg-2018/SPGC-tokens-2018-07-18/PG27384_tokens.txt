chapter
i
an
abbess
of
the
eighteenth
century
on
the
february
a
carriage
bearing
the
of
france
with
the
motto
of
orleans
preceded
by
two
outriders
and
a
page
entered
the
porch
of
the
abbey
of
chelles
precisely
as
the
clock
struck
ten
and
the
door
having
been
quickly
opened
its
two
occupants
stepped
out
the
first
was
a
man
of
from
to
years
of
age
short
and
rather
stout
with
a
high
color
easy
in
his
movements
and
displaying
in
every
gesture
a
certain
air
of
high
breeding
and
command
the
second
who
followed
slowly
was
short
and
remarkably
thin
his
face
though
not
precisely
ugly
was
very
disagreeable
although
bearing
the
evidences
of
a
keen
intellect
he
seemed
to
feel
the
cold
and
followed
his
companion
wrapped
up
in
an
ample
cloak
the
first
of
these
two
made
his
way
up
the
staircase
with
the
air
of
a
man
well
acquainted
with
the
locality
passing
through
a
large
antechamber
containing
several
nuns
who
bowed
to
the
ground
as
he
passed
he
ran
rather
than
walked
to
a
which
it
must
be
confessed
bore
but
little
trace
of
that
austerity
which
is
ordinarily
ascribed
to
the
interior
of
a
cloister
the
other
who
followed
leisurely
was
saluted
almost
as
humbly
by
the
nuns
and
now
said
the
first
wait
here
and
warm
yourself
while
i
go
to
her
and
in
ten
minutes
i
will
make
an
end
of
all
these
abuses
you
mention
if
she
deny
and
i
want
proof
i
will
call
you
ten
minutes
monseigneur
replied
the
man
in
the
cloak
in
two
hours
your
highness
will
not
have
even
broached
the
subject
of
your
visit
oh
the
abbess
de
chelles
is
a
clever
woman
so
saying
he
stretched
himself
out
in
an
easy
chair
which
he
had
drawn
near
the
fire
and
rested
his
thin
legs
on
the
fender
yes
yes
replied
he
who
had
been
addressed
as
your
highness
i
know
and
if
i
could
forget
it
you
take
care
to
remind
me
of
it
often
enough
why
did
you
bring
me
here
through
all
this
wind
and
snow
because
you
would
not
come
yesterday
monseigneur
yesterday
it
was
impossible
i
had
an
appointment
with
lord
stair
at
five
in
a
house
in
the
rue
des
bons
enfants
my
lord
does
not
live
any
longer
then
at
the
english
embassy
abbe
i
had
forbidden
you
to
follow
me
monseigneur
it
is
my
duty
to
disobey
you
well
then
disobey
but
let
me
tell
stories
at
my
pleasure
without
your
having
the
impertinence
to
show
me
that
you
know
it
just
for
the
sake
of
proving
the
efficiency
of
your
police
monseigneur
may
rest
easy
in
future
i
will
believe
anything
i
will
not
promise
as
much
in
return
abbe
for
here
i
think
you
have
made
a
mistake
monseigneur
i
know
what
i
said
and
i
repeat
it
but
look
no
noise
no
light
perfect
quiet
your
account
is
incorrect
it
is
evident
that
we
are
late
yesterday
monseigneur
where
you
stand
there
was
an
orchestra
of
fifty
musicians
there
where
that
young
sister
kneels
so
devoutly
was
a
buffet
what
was
upon
it
i
can
not
tell
but
i
know
it
was
there
and
in
the
gallery
on
the
left
where
a
modest
supper
of
lentils
and
cream
cheese
is
now
preparing
for
the
holy
sisters
were
two
hundred
people
drinking
dancing
and
making
well
making
what
making
love
monseigneur
diable
are
you
sure
of
this
rather
more
sure
than
if
i
had
seen
it
and
that
is
why
you
do
well
in
coming
and
would
have
done
better
in
coming
yesterday
this
sort
of
life
does
not
become
an
abbess
monseigneur
no
it
is
only
fit
for
an
abbe
ha
i
am
a
politician
monseigneur
well
my
daughter
is
a
political
abbess
that
is
all
oh
let
it
be
so
if
it
suits
you
monseigneur
i
am
not
so
particular
in
point
of
morals
you
know
there
will
be
another
song
or
two
out
but
what
does
that
matter
well
well
wait
for
me
and
i
will
go
and
scold
take
my
word
for
it
monseigneur
if
you
wish
to
scold
properly
you
had
better
do
it
here
before
me
if
you
fail
in
memory
or
arguments
sign
to
me
and
i
will
come
to
the
rescue
yes
yes
you
are
right
said
the
person
who
had
undertaken
to
redress
wrongs
and
in
whom
we
hope
the
reader
has
recognized
philippe
yes
this
scandal
must
be
quieted
a
little
at
any
rate
the
abbess
must
not
receive
more
than
twice
a
week
there
must
be
none
of
these
dances
and
assemblies
and
the
cloisters
must
be
mademoiselle
passed
from
gayety
to
a
religious
life
she
left
the
palais
royal
for
chelles
in
spite
of
all
i
could
do
to
prevent
her
now
for
five
days
in
the
week
she
must
be
the
abbess
and
that
will
leave
her
two
to
play
the
great
lady
ah
monseigneur
you
are
beginning
to
see
the
thing
in
its
true
light
is
not
this
what
you
wish
it
is
what
is
necessary
it
seems
to
me
that
an
abbess
who
has
thirty
valets
fifteen
footmen
ten
cooks
eight
grooms
and
a
mute
who
fences
plays
the
horn
and
the
violincello
who
is
a
surgeon
and
a
hairdresser
who
shoots
and
makes
fireworks
can
not
be
very
dull
has
not
my
daughter
been
told
of
my
arrival
said
the
duke
to
an
old
nun
who
crossed
the
room
with
a
bunch
of
keys
in
her
hand
i
wish
to
know
whether
i
shall
go
to
her
or
whether
she
is
coming
to
me
madame
is
coming
monseigneur
replied
the
sister
respectfully
it
is
well
murmured
the
regent
somewhat
impatiently
monseigneur
remember
the
parable
of
jesus
driving
out
the
from
the
temple
you
know
it
or
ought
to
know
it
for
i
taught
it
you
when
i
was
your
preceptor
now
drive
out
these
musicians
these
pharisees
these
comedians
and
anatomists
three
only
of
each
profession
will
make
a
nice
escort
for
our
return
do
not
fear
i
am
in
a
preaching
vein
then
replied
dubois
rising
that
is
most
fortunate
for
here
she
is
at
this
moment
a
door
leading
to
the
interior
of
the
convent
was
opened
and
the
person
so
impatiently
expected
appeared
let
us
explain
who
was
this
worthy
person
who
had
succeeded
by
repeated
follies
in
rousing
the
anger
of
philippe
the
most
indulgent
man
and
father
in
france
mademoiselle
de
chartres
was
the
second
and
prettiest
of
the
regent
daughters
she
had
a
beautiful
complexion
fine
eyes
a
good
figure
and
hands
her
teeth
were
splendid
and
her
grandmother
the
princess
palatine
compared
them
to
a
string
of
pearls
in
a
coral
casket
she
danced
well
sang
better
and
played
at
sight
she
had
learned
of
cauchereau
one
of
the
first
artists
at
the
opera
with
whom
she
had
made
much
more
progress
than
is
common
with
ladies
and
especially
with
princesses
it
is
true
that
she
was
most
assiduous
the
secret
of
that
assiduity
will
be
shortly
revealed
all
her
tastes
were
masculine
she
appeared
to
have
changed
sex
with
her
brother
louis
she
loved
dogs
and
horses
amused
herself
with
pistols
and
foils
but
cared
little
for
any
feminine
occupations
her
chief
predilection
however
was
for
music
she
seldom
missed
a
night
at
the
opera
when
her
master
cauchereau
performed
and
once
when
he
surpassed
himself
in
an
air
she
exclaimed
bravo
bravo
my
dear
cauchereau
in
a
voice
audible
to
the
whole
house
the
duchesse
judged
that
the
exclamation
was
somewhat
indiscreet
for
a
princess
of
the
blood
and
decided
that
mademoiselle
chartres
knew
enough
of
music
cauchereau
was
well
paid
and
desired
not
to
return
to
the
palais
royal
the
duchess
also
begged
her
daughter
to
spend
a
fortnight
at
the
convent
of
chelles
the
abbess
of
which
a
sister
of
marechal
de
villars
was
a
friend
of
hers
it
was
doubtless
during
this
retreat
that
mademoiselle
who
did
everything
by
fits
and
starts
resolved
to
renounce
the
world
toward
the
end
of
the
holy
week
of
she
asked
and
obtained
her
permission
to
spend
easter
at
chelles
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
instead
of
returning
to
the
palais
she
expressed
a
wish
to
remain
as
a
nun
the
duke
tried
to
oppose
this
but
mademoiselle
de
chartres
was
obstinate
and
on
the
of
april
she
took
the
vows
then
the
duke
treated
with
mademoiselle
de
villars
for
the
abbey
and
on
the
promise
of
twelve
thousand
francs
mademoiselle
de
chartres
was
named
abbess
in
her
stead
and
she
had
occupied
the
post
about
a
year
this
then
was
the
abbess
of
chelles
who
appeared
before
her
father
not
surrounded
by
an
elegant
and
profane
court
but
followed
by
six
nuns
dressed
in
black
and
holding
torches
there
was
no
sign
of
frivolity
or
of
pleasure
nothing
but
the
most
somber
apparel
and
the
most
severe
aspect
the
regent
however
suspected
that
he
had
been
kept
waiting
while
all
this
was
preparing
i
do
not
like
hypocrisy
said
he
sharply
and
can
forgive
vices
which
are
not
hidden
under
the
garb
of
virtues
all
these
lights
madame
are
doubtless
the
remains
of
yesterday
illumination
are
all
your
flowers
so
faded
and
all
your
guests
so
fatigued
that
you
can
not
show
me
a
single
bouquet
nor
a
single
dancer
monsieur
said
the
abbess
in
a
grave
tone
this
is
not
the
place
for
fetes
and
amusements
yes
answered
the
regent
i
see
that
if
you
feasted
yesterday
you
fast
did
you
come
here
monsieur
to
catechise
at
least
what
you
see
should
reply
to
any
accusations
against
me
i
came
to
tell
you
madame
replied
the
regent
annoyed
at
being
supposed
to
have
been
duped
that
the
life
you
lead
displeases
me
your
conduct
yesterday
was
unbecoming
an
abbess
your
austerities
are
unbecoming
a
princess
of
the
blood
decide
once
for
all
between
the
nun
and
the
court
lady
people
begin
to
speak
ill
of
you
and
i
have
enemies
enough
of
my
own
without
your
saddling
me
with
others
from
the
depth
of
your
convent
alas
monsieur
in
giving
entertainments
balls
and
concerts
which
have
been
quoted
as
the
best
in
paris
i
have
neither
pleased
those
enemies
nor
you
nor
myself
yesterday
was
my
last
interview
with
the
world
this
morning
i
have
taken
leave
of
it
forever
and
while
still
ignorant
of
your
visit
i
had
adopted
a
determination
from
which
i
will
never
depart
and
what
is
it
asked
the
regent
suspecting
that
this
was
only
a
new
specimen
of
his
daughter
ordinary
follies
come
to
this
window
and
look
out
said
the
abbess
the
regent
in
compliance
with
the
invitation
approached
the
window
and
saw
a
large
fire
blazing
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
dubois
who
was
as
curious
as
if
he
had
really
been
an
abbe
slipped
up
beside
him
several
people
were
rapidly
passing
and
repassing
before
the
fire
and
throwing
various
objects
into
the
flames
but
what
is
that
asked
the
regent
of
dubois
who
seemed
as
much
surprised
as
himself
that
which
is
burning
now
asked
the
yes
replied
the
regent
ma
foi
monseigneur
it
looks
to
me
very
much
like
a
violincello
it
is
mine
said
the
abbess
an
excellent
violincello
by
valeri
and
you
are
burning
it
exclaimed
the
duke
all
instruments
are
sources
of
perdition
said
the
abbess
in
a
tone
which
betrayed
the
most
profound
remorse
eh
but
here
is
a
harpsichord
interrupted
the
duke
my
harpsichord
monsieur
it
was
so
perfect
that
it
enticed
me
toward
earthly
things
i
condemned
it
this
morning
and
what
are
those
chests
of
papers
with
which
they
are
feeding
the
fire
asked
dubois
whom
the
spectacle
seemed
to
interest
immensely
my
music
which
i
am
having
burned
your
music
demanded
the
regent
yes
and
even
yours
answered
the
abbess
look
carefully
and
you
will
see
your
opera
of
follow
in
its
turn
you
will
understand
that
my
resolution
once
taken
its
execution
was
necessarily
general
well
madame
this
time
you
are
really
mad
to
light
the
fire
with
music
and
then
feed
it
with
and
harpsichords
is
really
a
little
too
luxurious
i
am
doing
penance
monsieur
hum
say
rather
that
you
are
refitting
your
house
and
that
this
is
an
excuse
for
buying
new
furniture
since
you
are
doubtless
tired
of
the
old
no
monseigneur
it
is
no
such
thing
well
then
what
is
it
tell
me
frankly
in
truth
i
am
weary
of
amusing
myself
and
indeed
i
intend
to
act
differently
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
am
going
with
my
nuns
to
visit
my
tomb
diable
monseigneur
exclaimed
the
abbe
her
wits
are
gone
at
last
it
will
be
truly
edifying
will
it
not
monsieur
continued
the
abbess
gravely
indeed
answered
the
regent
if
you
really
do
this
i
doubt
not
but
people
will
laugh
at
it
twice
as
much
as
they
did
at
your
suppers
will
you
accompany
me
messieurs
continued
the
abbess
i
am
going
to
spend
a
few
minutes
in
my
coffin
it
is
a
fancy
i
have
had
a
long
time
you
will
have
plenty
of
time
for
that
said
the
regent
moreover
you
have
not
even
invented
this
amusement
for
charles
the
fifth
who
became
a
monk
as
you
became
a
nun
without
exactly
knowing
why
thought
of
it
before
you
then
you
will
not
go
with
me
monsieur
said
the
abbess
i
answered
the
duke
who
had
not
the
least
sympathy
with
somber
ideas
i
go
to
see
tombs
i
go
to
hear
the
de
profundis
no
pardieu
and
the
only
thing
which
consoles
me
for
not
being
able
to
escape
them
some
day
is
that
i
shall
neither
see
the
one
nor
the
other
ah
monsieur
answered
the
abbess
in
a
scandalized
tone
you
do
not
then
believe
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
i
believe
that
you
are
raving
mad
confound
this
abbe
who
promises
me
a
feast
and
brings
me
to
a
funeral
by
my
faith
monseigneur
said
dubois
i
think
i
prefer
the
extravagance
of
yesterday
it
was
more
attractive
the
abbess
bowed
and
made
a
few
steps
toward
the
door
the
duke
and
dubois
remained
staring
at
each
other
uncertain
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
one
word
more
said
the
duke
are
you
decided
this
time
or
is
it
not
some
fever
which
you
have
caught
from
your
confessor
if
it
be
real
i
have
nothing
to
say
but
if
it
be
a
fever
i
desire
that
they
cure
you
of
it
i
have
morceau
and
chirac
whom
i
pay
for
attending
on
me
and
mine
monseigneur
answered
the
abbess
you
forget
that
i
know
sufficient
of
medicine
to
undertake
my
own
cure
if
i
were
ill
i
can
therefore
assure
you
that
i
am
not
i
am
a
jansenist
that
is
all
ah
cried
the
duke
this
is
more
of
father
le
doux
work
that
execrable
benedictine
at
least
i
know
a
treatment
which
will
cure
him
what
is
that
asked
the
abbess
the
bastille
and
he
went
out
in
a
rage
followed
by
dubois
who
was
laughing
heartily
you
see
said
the
regent
after
a
long
silence
and
when
they
were
nearing
paris
i
preached
with
a
good
grace
it
seems
it
was
i
who
needed
the
sermon
well
you
are
a
happy
father
that
is
all
i
compliment
you
on
your
younger
daughter
mademoiselle
de
chartres
unluckily
your
elder
daughter
the
duchesse
de
berry
oh
do
not
talk
of
her
she
is
my
ulcer
particularly
when
i
am
in
a
bad
temper
well
i
have
a
great
mind
to
make
use
of
it
by
finishing
with
her
at
one
blow
she
is
at
the
luxembourg
i
believe
so
let
us
go
to
the
luxembourg
monseigneur
you
go
with
me
i
shall
not
leave
you
well
drive
to
the
luxembourg
chapter
ii
decidedly
the
family
begins
to
settle
down
whatever
the
regent
might
say
the
duchesse
de
berry
was
his
favorite
daughter
at
seven
years
of
age
she
had
been
seized
with
a
disease
which
all
the
doctors
declared
to
be
fatal
and
when
they
had
abandoned
her
her
father
who
had
studied
medicine
took
her
in
hand
himself
and
succeeded
in
saving
her
from
that
time
the
regent
affection
for
his
daughter
became
almost
a
weakness
he
allowed
the
haughty
and
child
the
most
perfect
liberty
her
education
was
neglected
but
this
did
not
prevent
louis
xiv
from
choosing
her
as
a
wife
for
his
grandson
the
duc
de
berry
it
is
well
known
how
death
at
once
struck
a
triple
blow
at
the
royal
posterity
and
within
a
few
years
carried
off
the
dauphin
the
duc
and
duchesse
de
bourgoyne
and
the
duc
de
berry
left
a
widow
at
twenty
years
of
age
loving
her
father
almost
as
tenderly
as
he
loved
her
and
having
to
choose
between
the
society
of
versailles
and
that
of
the
palais
royal
the
duchesse
de
berry
young
beautiful
and
fond
of
pleasure
had
quickly
decided
she
took
part
in
all
the
fetes
the
pleasures
and
follies
of
her
father
the
duc
in
his
increasing
fondness
for
his
daughter
who
already
had
six
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
allowed
her
four
hundred
thousand
francs
more
from
his
private
fortune
he
gave
up
the
luxembourg
to
her
gave
her
a
bodyguard
and
at
length
to
the
scandal
of
those
who
advocated
the
old
forms
of
etiquette
he
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
the
duchesse
de
berry
passed
through
paris
preceded
by
cymbals
and
trumpets
and
only
laughed
when
she
received
the
venetian
ambassador
on
a
throne
raised
on
three
steps
which
nearly
embroiled
france
with
the
republic
of
venice
about
this
time
the
duchesse
de
berry
took
a
fancy
to
fall
in
love
with
the
chevalier
de
riom
the
chevalier
de
riom
was
a
nephew
or
of
the
duc
de
lauzun
who
came
to
paris
in
to
seek
his
fortune
and
found
it
at
the
luxembourg
introduced
to
the
princess
by
madame
de
mouchy
he
soon
established
the
same
influence
over
her
as
his
uncle
the
duc
de
lauzun
had
exercised
over
la
grande
mademoiselle
fifty
years
before
and
was
soon
established
as
her
lover
supplanting
lahaie
who
was
sent
on
an
embassy
to
denmark
the
duchess
had
the
singular
moderation
of
never
having
had
more
than
two
lovers
lahaie
whom
she
had
never
avowed
and
riom
whom
she
proclaimed
aloud
this
was
not
the
true
cause
of
the
malice
with
which
the
princess
was
pursued
it
arose
rather
from
the
previous
offenses
of
her
passage
through
paris
the
reception
of
the
ambassadors
her
bodyguard
and
her
assumptions
the
duke
himself
was
indignant
at
riom
influence
over
his
daughter
riom
had
been
brought
up
by
the
duc
de
lauzun
who
in
the
morning
had
crushed
the
hand
of
the
princesse
de
monaco
with
the
heel
of
the
boot
which
in
the
evening
he
made
the
daughter
of
gaston
pull
off
and
who
had
given
his
nephew
the
following
instruction
which
riom
had
fully
carried
out
the
daughters
of
france
said
he
must
be
treated
with
a
high
hand
and
riom
trusting
to
his
uncle
experience
had
so
well
schooled
the
duchesse
de
berry
that
she
scarcely
dared
to
give
a
fete
without
his
permission
the
duke
took
as
strong
a
dislike
to
riom
as
his
careless
character
allowed
him
to
take
to
any
one
and
under
pretext
of
serving
the
duchess
had
given
him
a
regiment
then
the
government
of
cognac
then
the
order
to
retire
to
his
government
which
almost
made
his
favors
look
like
disfavors
and
disgrace
the
duchess
was
not
deceived
she
went
to
her
father
begged
prayed
and
scolded
but
in
vain
and
she
went
away
threatening
the
duke
with
her
anger
and
declaring
that
riom
should
not
go
the
duke
only
reply
was
to
repeat
his
orders
for
riom
departure
the
next
day
and
riom
had
respectfully
promised
to
obey
the
same
day
which
was
the
one
preceding
that
on
which
our
story
opens
riom
had
ostensibly
set
out
and
dubois
himself
had
told
the
duke
that
he
had
left
for
cognac
at
nine
meanwhile
the
duke
had
not
again
seen
his
daughter
thus
when
he
spoke
of
going
to
finish
with
her
it
was
rather
a
pardon
than
a
quarrel
that
he
went
to
seek
dubois
had
not
been
duped
by
this
pretended
resolution
but
riom
was
gone
and
that
was
all
he
wanted
he
hoped
to
slip
in
some
new
personage
who
should
efface
all
memory
of
riom
who
was
to
be
sent
to
join
the
maréchal
de
berwick
in
spain
the
carriage
stopped
before
the
luxembourg
which
was
lighted
as
usual
the
duke
ascended
the
steps
with
his
usual
celerity
dubois
remained
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
presently
the
duke
appeared
at
the
door
with
a
disappointed
air
ah
monseigneur
said
dubois
are
you
refused
admittance
no
the
duchesse
is
not
here
where
then
at
the
carmelites
no
at
meudon
at
meudon
in
february
and
in
such
weather
what
can
she
be
doing
there
it
is
easy
to
know
how
let
us
go
to
meudon
to
meudon
said
the
regent
jumping
into
the
carriage
i
allow
you
minutes
to
get
there
i
would
humbly
beg
to
remind
monseigneur
said
the
coachman
that
the
horses
have
already
gone
ten
leagues
kill
them
but
be
at
meudon
in
minutes
there
was
no
reply
to
be
made
to
such
an
order
the
coachman
whipped
his
horses
and
the
noble
animals
set
out
at
as
brisk
a
pace
as
if
they
had
just
left
the
stable
throughout
the
drive
dubois
was
silent
and
the
regent
thoughtful
there
was
nothing
on
the
route
to
arrest
the
attention
of
either
and
they
arrived
at
meudon
full
of
contradictory
reflections
this
time
both
alighted
dubois
thinking
the
interview
might
be
long
was
anxious
to
find
a
more
comfortable
than
a
carriage
at
the
door
they
found
a
swiss
in
full
livery
he
stopped
them
the
duke
made
himself
known
pardon
said
the
swiss
i
did
not
know
that
monseigneur
was
expected
expected
or
not
i
am
here
send
word
to
the
princess
monseigneur
is
to
be
at
the
ceremony
asked
the
swiss
who
seemed
embarrassed
yes
of
course
put
in
dubois
stopping
the
duke
who
was
about
to
ask
what
ceremony
and
i
also
then
shall
i
lead
monseigneur
at
once
to
the
chapel
to
the
chapel
asked
the
duke
yes
for
the
ceremony
is
already
commenced
ah
dubois
said
the
duke
is
she
also
going
to
take
the
veil
monseigneur
said
dubois
i
should
rather
say
she
is
going
to
be
married
pardieu
exclaimed
the
regent
that
would
crown
all
and
he
darted
toward
the
staircase
followed
by
dubois
does
not
monseigneur
wish
me
to
guide
him
asked
the
swiss
it
is
needless
cried
the
regent
i
know
the
way
indeed
with
an
agility
surprising
in
so
corpulent
a
man
the
regent
darted
through
the
rooms
and
corridors
and
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
chapel
which
appeared
to
be
closed
but
yielded
to
the
first
touch
dubois
was
right
riom
who
had
returned
secretly
was
on
his
knees
with
the
princess
before
the
private
chaplain
of
the
luxembourg
while
de
pons
relative
and
the
marquis
de
la
rochefoucauld
captain
of
the
guard
held
the
canopy
over
their
heads
de
mouchy
and
de
lauzun
stood
one
by
the
duchess
and
the
other
by
riom
certainly
fortune
is
against
us
monseigneur
said
dubois
we
are
five
minutes
too
late
mordieu
cried
the
duke
exasperated
we
will
see
chut
said
dubois
i
can
not
permit
sacrilege
if
it
were
any
use
i
do
not
say
but
this
would
be
mere
folly
are
they
married
then
asked
the
duke
drawing
back
so
much
married
monseigneur
that
the
devil
himself
can
not
unmarry
them
without
the
assistance
of
the
pope
i
will
write
to
rome
take
care
monseigneur
do
not
waste
your
influence
you
will
want
it
all
so
get
me
made
a
cardinal
but
exclaimed
the
regent
such
a
marriage
is
intolerable
mésalliances
are
in
fashion
said
dubois
there
is
nothing
else
talked
of
louis
xiv
made
a
mésalliance
in
marrying
madame
de
maintenon
to
whom
you
pay
a
pension
as
his
widow
la
grande
mademoiselle
made
a
mésalliance
in
marrying
the
duc
de
lauzun
you
did
so
in
marrying
mademoiselle
de
blois
so
much
so
indeed
that
when
you
announced
the
marriage
to
your
mother
the
princess
palatine
she
replied
by
a
blow
did
not
i
do
the
same
when
i
married
the
daughter
of
a
village
schoolmaster
after
such
good
examples
why
should
not
your
daughter
do
so
in
her
turn
silence
demon
said
the
regent
besides
continued
dubois
the
duchesse
de
berry
passion
began
to
be
talked
about
and
this
will
quiet
the
talk
for
it
will
be
known
all
through
paris
decidedly
monseigneur
your
family
begins
to
settle
down
the
duc
uttered
an
oath
to
which
dubois
replied
by
a
laugh
which
mephistopheles
might
have
envied
silence
cried
a
swiss
who
did
not
know
who
it
was
that
was
making
a
noise
and
did
not
wish
the
pious
exhortation
of
the
chaplain
to
be
lost
silence
monseigneur
repeated
dubois
you
are
disturbing
the
ceremony
if
we
are
not
silent
replied
the
duke
the
next
thing
they
will
do
will
be
to
turn
us
out
silence
repeated
the
swiss
striking
the
flagstone
with
his
halberd
while
the
duchesse
de
berry
sent
de
mouchy
to
learn
who
was
causing
the
disturbance
de
mouchy
obeyed
the
orders
of
the
duchess
and
perceiving
two
persons
who
appeared
to
be
concealing
themselves
in
the
shade
he
approached
them
who
is
making
this
noise
said
he
and
who
gave
you
permission
to
enter
this
chapel
one
who
has
a
great
mind
to
send
you
all
out
by
the
window
replied
the
regent
but
who
will
content
himself
at
present
with
begging
you
to
order
de
riom
to
set
out
at
once
for
cognac
and
to
intimate
to
the
duchesse
de
berry
that
she
had
better
absent
herself
from
the
palais
royal
the
regent
went
out
signing
to
dubois
to
follow
and
leaving
de
mouchy
bewildered
at
his
appearance
returned
to
the
palais
royal
that
evening
the
regent
wrote
a
letter
and
ringing
for
a
valet
take
care
that
this
letter
is
dispatched
by
an
express
courier
morning
and
is
delivered
only
to
the
person
to
whom
it
is
addressed
that
person
was
madame
ursule
superior
of
the
ursuline
convent
at
clisson
chapter
iii
what
passed
three
nights
later
at
eight
hundred
leagues
from
the
palais
royal
three
nights
after
that
on
which
we
have
seen
the
regent
first
at
chelles
and
then
at
meudon
a
scene
passed
in
the
environs
of
nantes
which
can
not
be
omitted
in
this
history
we
will
therefore
exercise
our
privilege
of
transporting
the
reader
to
that
place
on
the
road
to
clisson
two
or
three
miles
from
nantes
near
the
convent
known
as
the
residence
of
abelard
was
a
large
dark
house
surrounded
by
thick
stunted
trees
hedges
everywhere
surrounded
the
inclosure
outside
the
walls
hedges
impervious
to
the
sight
and
only
interrupted
by
a
wicket
gate
this
gate
led
into
a
garden
at
the
end
of
which
was
a
wall
having
a
small
massive
and
closed
door
from
a
distance
this
grave
and
dismal
residence
appeared
like
a
prison
it
was
however
a
convent
full
of
young
augustines
subject
to
a
rule
lenient
as
compared
with
provincial
customs
but
rigid
as
compared
with
those
of
paris
the
house
was
inaccessible
on
three
sides
but
the
fourth
which
did
not
face
the
road
abutted
on
a
large
sheet
of
water
and
ten
feet
above
its
surface
were
the
windows
of
the
refectory
this
little
lake
was
carefully
guarded
and
was
surrounded
by
high
wooden
palisades
a
single
iron
gate
opened
into
it
and
at
the
same
time
gave
a
passage
to
the
waters
of
a
small
rivulet
which
fed
the
lake
and
the
water
had
egress
at
the
opposite
end
in
the
summer
a
small
boat
belonging
to
the
garden
was
seen
on
the
water
and
was
used
for
fishing
sometimes
also
in
summer
on
dark
nights
the
was
mysteriously
opened
and
a
man
wrapped
in
a
large
brown
cloak
silently
dropped
into
the
little
boat
which
appeared
to
detach
itself
from
its
fastenings
then
glided
quietly
along
and
stopped
under
one
of
the
barred
windows
of
the
refectory
soon
a
sound
was
heard
imitating
the
croaking
of
a
frog
or
the
cry
of
the
owl
so
common
there
and
then
a
young
girl
would
appear
at
the
window
and
pass
her
head
through
the
opening
between
the
bars
which
were
however
too
high
for
the
man
to
reach
a
low
and
tender
conversation
was
then
carried
on
and
at
length
after
a
different
hour
and
a
different
signal
had
been
agreed
upon
for
their
next
interview
they
separated
the
boat
disappeared
the
gate
shut
gently
and
the
young
girl
closed
the
window
with
a
sigh
but
now
it
was
the
month
of
february
and
in
the
terrible
winter
of
the
trees
were
powdered
with
hoar
frost
and
it
was
at
this
time
impossible
to
glide
quietly
along
in
the
little
boat
for
the
lake
was
covered
with
ice
and
yet
in
this
biting
cold
in
this
dark
starless
night
a
cavalier
ventured
alone
into
the
open
country
and
along
a
which
led
to
clisson
he
threw
the
reins
on
the
neck
of
his
horse
which
proceeded
at
a
slow
and
careful
pace
soon
however
in
spite
of
his
instinctive
precaution
the
poor
animal
which
had
no
light
to
guide
him
struck
against
a
stone
and
nearly
fell
the
rider
soon
perceived
that
his
horse
was
lamed
and
on
seeing
a
trail
of
blood
upon
the
snow
discovered
that
it
was
wounded
the
young
man
appeared
seriously
annoyed
at
the
accident
and
while
deliberating
what
course
to
take
he
heard
a
sound
of
horses
feet
on
the
same
road
and
feeling
sure
that
if
they
were
pursuing
him
he
could
not
escape
them
he
remounted
his
horse
drew
aside
behind
some
fallen
trees
put
his
sword
under
his
arm
drew
out
a
pistol
and
waited
the
cavalcade
soon
appeared
they
were
four
in
number
and
rode
silently
along
passing
the
group
of
trees
which
hid
the
cavalier
when
suddenly
they
stopped
one
who
appeared
the
chief
alighted
took
out
a
dark
lantern
and
examined
the
road
as
they
could
not
see
far
they
returned
some
steps
and
by
the
light
of
their
lantern
perceived
the
cavalier
the
sound
of
cocking
pistols
was
now
heard
hola
said
the
cavalier
with
the
wounded
horse
taking
the
initiative
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
it
is
he
murmured
two
or
three
voices
the
man
with
the
lantern
advanced
toward
the
cavalier
advance
one
step
further
and
you
are
a
dead
man
said
the
cavalier
declare
your
name
at
once
that
i
may
know
with
whom
i
have
to
deal
shoot
no
one
gaston
de
chanlay
replied
the
man
with
the
lantern
calmly
and
put
up
your
pistols
ah
it
is
the
marquis
de
pontcalec
yes
it
is
i
and
what
do
you
come
here
for
may
i
ask
to
demand
some
explanation
of
your
conduct
approach
and
reply
if
you
please
the
invitation
is
singular
marquis
if
you
wish
for
an
answer
could
you
not
ask
it
in
other
terms
approach
gaston
said
another
voice
we
really
wish
to
speak
with
you
a
la
bonne
heure
said
chanlay
i
recognize
you
there
montlouis
but
i
confess
i
am
not
accustomed
to
de
pontcalec
manner
of
proceeding
my
manners
are
those
of
a
frank
and
open
breton
monsieur
replied
the
marquis
of
one
who
has
nothing
to
hide
from
his
friends
and
is
willing
to
be
questioned
as
freely
as
he
questions
others
i
join
montlouis
said
another
voice
in
begging
gaston
to
explain
amicably
surely
it
is
not
our
interest
to
quarrel
among
ourselves
thanks
du
couëdic
said
de
chanlay
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
so
here
i
am
and
sheathing
his
sword
at
these
words
the
young
man
issued
from
his
retreat
and
approached
the
group
de
talhouet
said
pontcalec
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
has
a
right
to
issue
commands
watch
that
no
one
approaches
de
talhouet
obeyed
and
rode
round
in
a
circle
keeping
both
eyes
and
ears
open
and
now
said
the
marquis
let
us
put
out
our
lantern
since
we
have
found
our
man
messieurs
said
de
chanlay
all
this
seems
to
me
somewhat
strange
it
appears
that
you
were
following
me
that
you
were
seeking
for
me
now
you
have
found
me
and
may
put
out
your
lantern
what
does
it
mean
if
it
is
a
joke
i
confess
i
think
both
time
and
place
no
monsieur
replied
pontcalec
in
his
hard
dry
voice
it
is
not
a
joke
it
is
an
interrogatory
an
interrogatory
said
de
chanlay
frowning
an
explanation
rather
said
montlouis
interrogatory
or
explanation
it
matters
not
said
pontcalec
the
thing
is
too
serious
to
argue
about
words
de
chanlay
i
repeat
reply
to
our
questions
you
speak
roughly
marquis
de
pontcalec
replied
the
chevalier
if
i
command
it
is
because
i
have
the
right
to
do
so
am
i
or
am
i
not
your
chief
certainly
you
are
but
that
is
no
reason
for
forgetting
the
consideration
which
one
gentleman
owes
to
another
monsieur
de
chanlay
all
these
objections
seem
to
me
like
shuffling
you
have
sworn
to
obey
do
so
now
i
swore
to
obey
replied
the
chevalier
but
not
as
a
servant
you
swore
to
obey
as
a
slave
obey
then
or
submit
to
the
consequences
of
your
disobedience
monsieur
le
marquis
my
dear
gaston
cried
montlouis
speak
i
beg
as
soon
as
possible
by
a
word
you
can
remove
all
suspicion
suspicion
cried
gaston
pale
with
anger
am
suspected
then
certainly
you
are
said
pontcalec
with
his
ordinary
roughness
do
you
think
if
we
did
not
suspect
you
we
should
amuse
ourselves
by
following
you
on
such
a
night
as
this
oh
that
is
quite
another
matter
said
gaston
coldly
tell
me
your
suspicions
i
listen
chevalier
remember
the
facts
we
four
were
conspiring
together
and
we
did
not
seek
your
aid
you
offered
it
saying
that
besides
being
willing
to
aid
in
the
public
good
you
had
a
private
revenge
to
serve
in
this
am
i
not
right
you
are
we
received
you
welcomed
you
as
a
friend
as
a
brother
we
told
you
all
our
hopes
all
our
plans
nay
more
you
were
elected
by
chance
the
one
to
strike
the
glorious
blow
each
one
of
us
offered
to
take
your
part
but
you
refused
is
it
not
so
you
have
spoken
the
strictest
truth
marquis
this
very
morning
we
drew
the
lots
this
evening
you
should
be
on
the
road
to
paris
instead
of
that
where
do
we
find
you
on
the
road
to
clisson
where
are
lodged
the
mortal
enemies
of
breton
independence
where
lives
your
sworn
foe
the
marechal
de
montesquieu
ah
monsieur
said
gaston
scornfully
reply
by
open
words
and
not
by
sneers
reply
de
chanlay
and
quickly
reply
gaston
said
du
couëdic
and
montlouis
imploringly
and
to
what
am
i
to
reply
you
are
to
account
for
your
frequent
absence
during
the
last
two
months
for
the
mystery
which
surrounds
you
for
refusing
as
you
do
once
or
twice
weekly
to
join
our
nightly
meetings
we
confess
gaston
all
this
has
made
us
uneasy
by
a
word
you
can
reassure
us
you
see
monsieur
that
you
are
proved
guilty
by
hiding
instead
of
pursuing
your
course
i
did
not
pursue
my
course
because
my
horse
was
wounded
you
may
see
the
stains
of
blood
upon
the
road
but
why
did
you
hide
because
i
wished
to
know
first
who
was
pursuing
me
have
i
not
the
fear
of
being
arrested
as
well
as
yourselves
and
where
are
you
going
if
you
had
followed
my
steps
as
you
have
done
hitherto
you
would
have
found
that
my
path
did
not
lead
to
clisson
nor
to
paris
i
beg
said
de
chanlay
that
you
will
trust
me
and
respect
my
secret
a
secret
in
which
not
only
my
own
honor
but
that
of
another
is
concerned
you
do
not
know
perhaps
it
may
be
exaggerated
how
extreme
is
my
delicacy
on
this
point
then
it
is
a
said
yes
and
the
secret
of
a
first
love
replied
gaston
all
evasions
cried
pontcalec
marquis
said
gaston
haughtily
this
is
not
saying
enough
my
friend
replied
du
couëdic
how
can
we
believe
that
you
are
going
to
a
rendezvous
in
such
weather
and
that
this
rendezvous
is
not
at
clisson
where
except
the
augustine
convent
there
is
not
a
single
house
for
two
miles
around
de
chanlay
said
the
marquis
de
pontcalec
in
an
agitated
voice
you
swore
to
obey
me
as
your
chief
and
to
devote
soul
and
body
to
our
holy
cause
monsieur
our
undertaking
is
serious
our
property
our
liberties
our
lives
and
our
honor
are
at
stake
will
you
reply
clearly
and
freely
to
the
questions
which
i
put
to
you
in
the
name
of
all
so
as
to
remove
all
doubts
if
not
gaston
de
chanlay
by
virtue
of
that
right
which
you
gave
me
of
your
own
free
will
over
your
life
if
not
i
declare
on
my
honor
i
will
blow
your
brains
out
with
my
own
hand
a
solemn
silence
followed
these
words
not
one
voice
was
raised
to
defend
gaston
he
looked
at
each
one
in
turn
and
each
one
turned
away
from
him
marquis
said
the
chevalier
at
length
in
a
tone
of
deep
feeling
not
only
do
you
insult
me
by
suspicions
but
you
grieve
me
by
saying
that
i
can
only
remove
those
suspicions
by
declaring
my
secret
stay
added
he
drawing
a
pocketbook
from
his
coat
and
hastily
penciling
a
few
words
on
a
leaf
which
he
tore
out
stay
here
is
the
secret
you
wish
to
know
i
hold
it
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
i
hold
a
loaded
pistol
will
you
make
me
reparation
for
the
insult
you
have
offered
me
or
in
my
turn
i
give
you
my
word
as
a
gentleman
that
i
will
blow
my
brains
out
when
i
am
dead
open
my
hand
and
read
this
paper
you
will
then
see
if
i
deserved
your
suspicions
and
gaston
held
the
pistol
to
his
head
with
the
calm
resolution
which
showed
that
he
would
keep
his
word
gaston
gaston
cried
montlouis
while
du
couëdic
held
his
arm
stop
in
heaven
name
marquis
he
would
do
as
he
said
pardon
him
and
he
will
tell
us
all
is
it
not
so
gaston
you
will
not
have
a
secret
from
your
brothers
who
beg
you
in
the
names
of
their
wives
and
children
to
tell
it
them
certainly
said
the
marquis
i
not
only
pardon
but
love
him
he
knows
it
well
let
him
but
prove
his
innocence
and
i
will
make
him
every
reparation
but
before
that
nothing
he
is
young
and
alone
in
the
world
he
has
not
like
us
wives
and
children
whose
happiness
and
whose
fortune
he
is
risking
he
stakes
only
his
own
life
and
he
holds
that
as
cheaply
as
is
usual
at
twenty
years
of
age
but
with
his
life
he
risks
ours
and
yet
let
him
say
but
one
word
showing
a
justification
and
i
will
be
the
first
to
open
my
arms
to
him
well
marquis
said
gaston
after
a
few
moments
silence
follow
me
and
you
shall
be
satisfied
and
we
asked
montlouis
and
du
couëdic
come
also
you
are
all
gentlemen
i
risk
no
more
in
confiding
my
secret
to
all
than
to
one
the
marquis
called
talhouet
who
had
kept
good
watch
and
now
rejoined
the
group
and
followed
without
asking
what
had
passed
all
five
went
on
but
slowly
for
gaston
horse
was
lame
the
chevalier
guided
them
toward
the
convent
then
to
the
little
rivulet
and
at
ten
paces
from
the
iron
gate
he
stopped
it
is
here
said
he
here
at
the
convent
yes
my
friends
there
is
here
at
this
moment
a
young
girl
whom
i
have
loved
since
i
saw
her
a
year
ago
in
the
procession
at
the
fete
dieu
at
nantes
she
observed
me
also
i
followed
her
and
sent
her
a
letter
but
how
do
you
see
her
asked
the
marquis
a
hundred
louis
won
the
gardener
over
to
my
interest
he
has
given
me
a
key
to
this
gate
in
the
summer
i
come
in
a
boat
to
the
convent
wall
ten
feet
above
the
water
is
a
window
where
she
awaits
me
if
it
were
lighter
you
could
see
it
from
this
spot
and
in
spite
of
the
darkness
i
see
it
now
yes
i
understand
how
you
manage
in
summer
but
you
can
not
use
the
boat
now
true
but
instead
there
is
a
coating
of
ice
on
which
i
shall
go
this
evening
perhaps
it
will
break
and
engulf
me
so
much
the
better
for
then
i
hope
your
suspicions
would
die
with
me
you
have
taken
a
load
from
my
breast
said
montlouis
ah
my
poor
gaston
how
happy
you
make
me
for
remember
du
couëdic
and
i
answered
for
you
chevalier
said
the
marquis
pardon
and
embrace
us
willingly
marquis
but
you
have
destroyed
a
portion
of
my
happiness
how
so
i
wished
my
love
to
have
been
known
to
no
one
i
have
so
much
need
of
strength
and
courage
am
i
not
to
leave
her
forever
who
knows
chevalier
you
look
gloomily
at
the
future
i
know
what
i
am
saying
montlouis
if
you
succeed
and
with
your
courage
and
you
ought
to
succeed
france
is
free
then
she
will
owe
her
liberty
to
you
and
you
will
be
master
of
your
own
fate
ah
marquis
if
i
succeed
it
will
be
for
you
my
own
fate
is
fixed
courage
chevalier
meanwhile
let
us
see
how
you
manage
these
love
affairs
still
mistrust
marquis
still
my
dear
gaston
i
mistrust
myself
and
naturally
enough
after
being
named
your
chief
all
the
responsibility
rests
on
me
and
i
must
watch
over
you
all
at
least
marquis
i
am
as
anxious
to
reach
the
foot
of
that
wall
as
you
can
be
to
see
me
so
i
shall
not
keep
you
waiting
long
gaston
tied
his
horse
to
a
tree
by
means
of
a
plank
thrown
across
he
passed
the
stream
opened
the
gate
and
then
following
the
palisades
so
as
to
get
away
from
the
stream
he
stepped
upon
the
ice
which
cracked
under
his
feet
in
heaven
name
cried
montlouis
be
prudent
look
marquis
said
gaston
i
believe
you
i
believe
you
gaston
you
give
me
fresh
courage
replied
the
chevalier
and
now
gaston
one
word
more
when
shall
you
leave
at
this
time
marquis
i
shall
probably
be
thirty
leagues
on
the
way
to
paris
come
back
and
let
us
embrace
and
say
adieu
with
pleasure
gaston
retraced
his
steps
and
was
embraced
cordially
by
each
of
the
chevaliers
who
did
not
turn
away
till
they
saw
that
he
had
arrived
safely
at
the
end
of
his
perilous
journey
chapter
iv
showing
how
chance
arranges
some
matters
better
than
providence
in
spite
of
the
cracking
of
the
ice
gaston
pursued
his
way
boldly
and
perceived
with
a
beating
heart
that
the
winter
rains
had
raised
the
waters
of
the
little
lake
so
that
he
might
possibly
be
able
to
reach
the
window
he
was
not
mistaken
on
giving
the
signal
the
window
was
opened
then
a
head
appeared
nearly
at
the
level
of
his
own
and
a
hand
touched
his
it
was
the
first
time
gaston
seized
it
and
covered
it
with
kisses
gaston
you
have
come
in
spite
of
the
cold
and
on
the
ice
i
told
you
in
my
letter
not
to
do
so
with
your
letter
on
my
heart
helene
i
think
i
can
run
no
danger
but
what
have
you
to
tell
me
you
have
been
crying
alas
since
this
morning
i
have
done
little
else
since
this
morning
said
gaston
with
a
sad
smile
that
is
strange
if
i
were
not
a
man
i
too
should
have
cried
since
this
morning
what
do
you
say
gaston
nothing
nothing
tell
me
what
are
your
griefs
helene
alas
you
know
i
am
not
my
own
mistress
i
am
a
poor
orphan
brought
up
here
having
no
other
world
than
the
convent
i
have
never
seen
any
one
to
whom
i
can
give
the
names
of
father
or
mother
my
mother
i
believe
to
be
dead
and
my
father
is
absent
i
depend
upon
an
invisible
power
revealed
only
to
our
superior
this
morning
the
good
mother
sent
for
me
and
announced
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
i
was
to
leave
to
leave
the
convent
helene
yes
my
family
reclaims
me
gaston
your
family
alas
what
new
misfortune
awaits
us
yes
it
is
a
misfortune
gaston
our
good
mother
at
first
congratulated
me
as
if
it
were
a
pleasure
but
i
was
happy
here
and
wished
to
remain
till
i
became
your
wife
i
am
otherwise
disposed
of
but
how
and
this
order
to
remove
you
admits
of
neither
dispute
nor
delay
alas
it
seems
that
i
belong
to
a
powerful
family
and
that
i
am
the
daughter
of
some
great
nobleman
when
the
good
mother
told
me
i
must
leave
i
burst
into
tears
and
fell
on
my
knees
and
said
i
would
not
leave
her
then
suspecting
that
i
had
some
hidden
motive
she
pressed
me
questioned
me
and
forgive
me
gaston
i
wanted
to
confide
in
some
one
i
felt
the
want
of
pity
and
consolation
and
i
told
her
all
that
we
loved
each
other
all
except
the
manner
in
which
we
meet
i
was
afraid
if
i
told
her
that
that
she
would
prevent
my
seeing
you
this
last
time
to
say
adieu
but
did
you
not
tell
helene
what
were
my
plans
that
bound
to
an
association
myself
for
six
months
perhaps
for
a
year
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
very
day
i
should
be
free
my
name
my
fortune
my
very
life
was
yours
i
told
her
gaston
and
this
is
what
makes
me
think
i
am
the
daughter
of
some
powerful
nobleman
for
then
mother
ursula
replied
must
forget
the
chevalier
my
child
for
who
knows
that
your
new
family
would
consent
to
your
marrying
him
but
do
not
i
belong
to
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
brittany
and
though
i
am
not
rich
my
fortune
is
independent
did
you
say
this
helene
yes
i
said
to
her
chose
me
an
orphan
without
name
and
without
fortune
i
may
be
separated
from
him
but
it
would
be
cruel
ingratitude
to
forget
him
and
i
shall
never
do
so
helene
you
are
an
angel
and
you
can
not
then
imagine
who
are
your
parents
or
to
what
you
are
destined
no
it
seems
that
it
is
a
secret
on
which
all
my
future
happiness
depends
only
gaston
i
fear
they
are
high
in
station
for
it
almost
appeared
as
if
our
superior
spoke
to
me
with
deference
to
you
helene
yes
so
much
the
better
said
gaston
sighing
do
you
rejoice
at
our
separation
gaston
no
helene
but
i
rejoice
that
you
should
find
a
family
when
you
are
about
to
lose
a
friend
lose
a
friend
gaston
i
have
none
but
you
whom
then
should
i
lose
at
least
i
must
leave
you
for
some
time
helene
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
fate
has
endeavored
to
make
our
lots
similar
and
that
you
are
not
the
only
one
who
does
not
know
what
the
morrow
may
bring
forth
gaston
gaston
what
does
this
strange
language
mean
that
i
also
am
subject
to
a
fatality
which
i
must
obey
that
i
also
am
governed
by
an
irresistible
and
superior
power
you
oh
heavens
to
a
power
which
may
condemn
me
to
leave
you
in
a
week
in
a
fortnight
in
a
month
and
not
only
to
leave
you
but
to
leave
france
ah
gaston
what
do
you
tell
me
what
in
my
love
or
rather
in
my
egotism
i
have
dreaded
to
tell
you
before
i
shut
my
eyes
to
this
hour
and
yet
i
knew
that
it
must
come
this
morning
they
were
opened
i
must
leave
you
helene
but
why
what
have
you
undertaken
what
will
become
of
you
alas
helene
we
each
have
our
secret
said
the
chevalier
sorrowfully
i
pray
that
yours
may
be
less
terrible
than
mine
gaston
were
you
not
the
first
to
say
that
we
must
part
helene
had
not
you
first
the
courage
to
renounce
me
well
blessings
on
you
for
that
courage
for
i
helene
had
it
not
and
at
these
last
words
the
young
man
again
pressed
his
lips
to
her
hand
and
helene
could
see
that
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
oh
mon
dieu
murmured
she
how
have
we
deserved
this
misery
at
this
exclamation
gaston
raised
his
head
come
said
he
as
if
to
himself
courage
it
is
useless
to
struggle
against
these
necessities
let
us
obey
without
a
murmur
and
perhaps
our
resignation
may
disarm
our
fate
can
i
see
you
again
i
fear
not
i
leave
and
on
what
road
to
paris
good
heavens
cried
gaston
and
i
also
you
also
gaston
yes
helene
we
were
mistaken
we
need
not
part
oh
gaston
is
it
true
helene
we
had
no
right
to
accuse
providence
not
only
can
we
see
each
other
on
the
journey
but
at
paris
we
will
not
be
separated
how
do
you
travel
in
the
convent
carriage
with
post
horses
and
by
short
stages
who
goes
with
you
a
nun
who
will
return
to
the
convent
when
she
has
delivered
me
over
to
those
who
await
me
all
is
for
the
best
helene
i
shall
go
on
horseback
as
a
stranger
unknown
to
you
each
evening
i
may
speak
to
you
or
if
i
can
not
do
so
i
shall
at
least
see
you
it
will
be
but
a
half
separation
and
the
two
lovers
with
the
buoyant
hopes
of
youth
after
meeting
with
tears
and
sadness
parted
with
smiles
and
joyous
confidence
in
the
future
gaston
recrossed
the
frozen
lake
and
found
instead
of
his
own
wounded
horse
that
of
montlouis
and
thanks
to
this
kindness
reached
nantes
safely
in
less
than
three
quarters
of
an
hour
chapter
the
journey
that
very
night
gaston
made
his
will
and
deposited
it
with
a
notary
at
nantes
he
left
everything
to
helene
de
chaverny
begged
her
if
he
died
not
to
renounce
the
world
but
to
accept
the
career
opening
to
her
youth
and
beauty
but
as
he
was
the
last
of
his
family
he
begged
her
in
memeory
of
him
to
call
her
first
son
gaston
he
next
went
to
see
each
of
his
friends
and
once
more
told
them
that
he
believed
the
enterprise
would
be
successful
pontcalec
gave
him
half
a
piece
of
gold
and
a
letter
which
he
was
to
present
to
a
certain
captain
la
jonquiere
their
correspondent
at
paris
who
would
put
gaston
in
communication
with
the
important
persons
he
went
to
seek
he
then
put
all
the
ready
money
he
had
into
a
valise
and
accompanied
only
by
an
old
servant
named
owen
in
whom
he
had
great
confidence
he
set
out
from
nantes
it
was
midday
a
bright
sun
shone
on
the
stream
and
sparkled
on
the
icicles
which
hung
from
the
leafless
trees
as
gaston
made
his
way
along
the
deserted
road
looking
in
vain
for
anything
resembling
the
convent
carriage
the
servant
appeared
much
more
anxious
to
quicken
their
pace
than
gaston
himself
did
for
to
him
the
journey
was
fraught
with
annoyances
and
he
was
so
anxious
to
arrive
at
that
paris
of
which
he
had
heard
such
wonderful
tales
that
had
it
been
possible
he
would
willingly
have
added
wings
to
their
horses
feet
gaston
however
traveled
slowly
as
far
as
oudan
but
the
convent
carriage
proceeded
more
slowly
still
at
oudan
he
halted
he
chose
the
char
couronne
a
house
which
had
some
windows
overlooking
the
road
and
which
moreover
was
the
best
inn
in
the
village
while
his
dinner
was
preparing
gaston
in
spite
of
the
cold
remained
in
the
balcony
but
in
vain
he
looked
for
the
carriage
he
so
much
wished
to
see
then
he
thought
that
perhaps
helene
had
preceded
him
and
was
already
in
the
inn
he
went
at
once
to
a
window
at
the
back
overlooking
the
courtyard
to
inspect
the
carriages
standing
there
his
attention
was
arrested
by
seeing
not
the
carriage
but
his
servant
owen
speaking
earnestly
to
a
man
dressed
in
gray
and
wrapped
in
a
sort
of
military
cloak
who
after
a
short
conversation
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
off
with
the
air
of
a
man
to
whom
speed
is
of
the
utmost
importance
as
gaston
heard
his
steps
along
the
road
to
paris
at
this
moment
the
servant
raised
his
eyes
and
began
busily
brushing
the
snow
from
his
boots
and
clothes
gaston
signed
to
him
to
approach
who
were
you
talking
with
owen
to
a
man
m
gaston
who
is
that
man
a
traveler
a
soldier
who
was
asking
his
way
his
way
to
what
place
to
rennes
but
you
could
not
tell
him
for
you
do
not
know
this
place
i
asked
the
landlord
monsieur
why
could
not
he
ask
himself
because
he
had
had
a
quarrel
with
him
about
the
price
of
his
dinner
and
did
not
wish
to
speak
to
him
again
hum
said
gaston
nothing
was
more
natural
than
this
yet
gaston
became
thoughtful
but
he
quickly
threw
off
his
suspicions
accusing
himself
of
becoming
timid
at
a
time
when
he
most
needed
courage
his
brow
remained
clouded
however
for
the
carriage
did
not
appear
he
thought
at
one
moment
that
helene
might
have
chosen
another
road
in
order
to
part
from
him
without
noise
or
quarrel
but
he
soon
concluded
that
it
was
only
some
accident
which
delayed
her
he
sat
down
again
to
table
though
he
had
finished
his
dinner
and
when
owen
appeared
to
clear
away
some
wine
said
he
owen
had
already
removed
a
half
empty
bottle
some
wine
repeated
the
servant
in
astonishment
for
gaston
usually
drank
but
little
yes
some
wine
is
there
anything
surprising
in
that
no
monsieur
replied
owen
and
he
transmitted
the
order
for
a
second
bottle
of
wine
to
the
waiter
gaston
poured
out
a
glass
drank
it
then
a
second
owen
stared
then
thinking
it
both
his
duty
and
his
interest
to
prevent
his
finishing
the
bottle
monsieur
said
he
i
have
heard
that
if
you
are
riding
it
is
bad
to
drink
when
it
is
very
cold
you
forgot
that
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
and
that
it
will
be
getting
still
colder
and
if
we
wait
much
longer
we
shall
get
no
it
is
nearly
three
now
and
at
four
it
will
be
dark
this
behavior
surprised
gaston
you
are
in
a
very
great
hurry
owen
said
he
have
you
a
rendezvous
with
the
man
who
was
asking
his
way
of
you
monsieur
knows
that
to
be
impossible
replied
owen
since
he
is
going
to
rennes
and
we
to
paris
however
under
the
scrutinizing
gaze
of
his
master
owen
turned
red
when
suddenly
at
the
sound
of
wheels
gaston
ran
to
the
window
it
was
the
dark
carriage
at
this
sight
gaston
darted
from
the
room
it
was
then
owen
turn
to
run
to
the
window
to
see
what
it
was
that
had
so
much
interested
his
master
he
saw
a
green
and
black
carriage
stop
from
which
the
driver
alighted
and
opened
the
door
then
he
saw
a
young
lady
in
a
cloak
go
into
the
hotel
followed
by
an
augustine
sister
the
two
ladies
announcing
that
they
should
only
remain
to
dine
asked
for
a
room
but
to
reach
this
room
they
had
to
cross
a
public
salon
in
which
gaston
stood
near
the
a
rapid
but
meaning
glance
was
exchanged
between
him
and
helene
and
to
gaston
great
satisfaction
he
recognized
in
the
driver
of
the
carriage
the
convent
gardener
he
let
him
pass
however
unnoticed
but
as
he
crossed
the
yard
to
go
to
the
stable
he
followed
him
he
accosted
the
gardener
who
told
him
that
he
was
to
take
the
two
ladies
to
rambouillet
where
helene
would
remain
and
then
he
was
to
take
back
sister
therese
to
clisson
gaston
raising
his
eyes
suddenly
saw
owen
watching
him
and
this
curiosity
displeased
him
what
are
you
doing
there
asked
he
waiting
for
orders
said
owen
do
you
know
that
fellow
asked
gaston
of
the
gardener
owen
your
servant
of
course
i
do
we
are
from
the
same
place
so
much
the
worse
murmured
gaston
oh
owen
is
an
honest
fellow
never
mind
said
gaston
not
a
word
of
helene
i
beg
the
gardener
promised
and
indeed
it
was
his
own
interest
to
keep
the
secret
for
had
it
been
discovered
that
he
had
given
gaston
the
key
he
would
have
lost
his
place
after
a
hasty
meal
the
carriage
was
again
ordered
and
at
the
door
gaston
met
the
ladies
and
handed
them
in
chanlay
was
not
quite
unknown
to
the
sister
so
she
thanked
him
graciously
as
he
handed
her
in
monsieur
said
owen
behind
the
chevalier
our
horses
are
ready
one
more
glass
said
gaston
and
i
shall
start
to
owen
great
surprise
gaston
returned
to
the
room
and
ordered
a
third
bottle
for
owen
had
removed
the
second
of
which
gaston
had
only
drank
his
two
glasses
gaston
remained
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
having
no
further
motive
for
waiting
he
set
out
when
they
had
ridden
a
short
distance
they
saw
the
carriage
imbedded
in
a
deep
rut
where
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
horses
and
the
gardener
it
remained
stationary
gaston
could
not
leave
him
in
such
a
dilemma
and
the
gardener
recognizing
owen
called
to
him
for
aid
the
two
riders
dismounted
opened
the
carriage
door
took
out
the
ladies
and
succeeded
in
freeing
the
carriage
so
that
they
were
able
to
proceed
an
acquaintanceship
was
thus
established
and
the
poor
nun
who
was
very
timid
inquired
of
gaston
if
the
road
were
safe
gaston
reassured
her
and
said
that
he
and
his
servant
would
escort
them
and
his
offer
was
at
once
accepted
with
thanks
meanwhile
helene
had
played
her
part
admirably
showing
that
a
young
girl
however
simple
and
naïve
has
the
instinct
of
dissimulation
which
only
requires
opportunity
to
develop
itself
gaston
rode
along
close
to
the
door
for
the
road
was
narrow
and
sister
therese
asked
him
many
questions
she
learned
that
he
was
called
the
chevalier
de
livry
and
was
the
brother
of
one
of
the
young
ladies
who
had
been
in
the
convent
school
but
who
was
now
married
to
montlouis
they
stopped
as
previously
arranged
at
ancenis
the
gardener
confirmed
what
gaston
had
said
of
his
relationship
to
mademoiselle
de
livry
so
that
sister
therese
had
no
suspicion
and
was
very
friendly
with
him
she
was
in
fact
delighted
on
starting
the
next
morning
to
find
him
already
mounted
and
to
receive
his
accustomed
politeness
in
handing
them
into
the
carriage
as
he
did
so
he
slipped
a
note
into
hand
and
by
a
glance
she
told
him
he
should
receive
a
reply
gaston
rode
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
for
the
road
was
bad
and
assistance
was
frequently
required
either
to
free
a
wheel
to
assist
the
ladies
to
alight
for
the
purpose
of
walking
up
a
steep
ascent
or
some
of
the
many
accidents
of
a
journey
my
dear
helene
said
sister
therese
several
times
what
would
have
become
of
us
without
the
aid
of
this
gentleman
before
arriving
at
angers
gaston
inquired
at
what
hotel
they
were
going
to
stay
and
finding
that
it
was
the
same
at
which
he
intended
to
put
up
he
sent
owen
on
before
to
engage
apartments
when
they
arrived
he
received
a
note
which
helene
had
written
during
dinner
she
spoke
of
her
love
and
happiness
as
though
they
were
secure
and
everlasting
but
gaston
looked
on
the
future
in
its
true
light
bound
by
an
oath
to
undertake
a
terrible
mission
he
foresaw
sad
misfortunes
after
their
present
joy
he
remembered
that
he
was
about
to
lose
happiness
just
as
he
had
tasted
it
for
the
first
time
and
rebelled
against
his
fate
he
did
not
remember
that
he
had
sought
that
conspiracy
which
now
bound
him
and
which
forced
him
to
pursue
a
path
leading
to
exile
or
the
scaffold
while
he
had
in
sight
another
path
which
would
lead
him
direct
to
happiness
it
is
true
that
when
gaston
joined
the
conspiracy
he
did
not
know
helene
and
thought
himself
alone
in
the
world
at
twenty
years
of
age
he
had
believed
that
the
world
had
no
pleasure
for
him
then
he
had
met
helene
and
the
world
became
full
of
pleasure
and
hope
but
it
was
too
late
he
had
already
entered
on
a
career
from
which
he
could
not
draw
back
meanwhile
in
the
preoccupation
of
his
mind
gaston
had
quite
forgotten
his
suspicions
of
owen
and
had
not
noticed
that
he
had
spoken
to
two
cavaliers
similar
to
the
one
whom
he
had
seen
the
first
evening
but
owen
lost
nothing
of
what
passed
between
gaston
and
helene
as
they
approached
the
end
of
their
journey
gaston
became
sad
and
when
the
landlord
at
chartres
replied
to
the
question
of
sister
therese
you
may
if
you
choose
reach
rambouillet
it
was
as
though
he
had
said
you
separate
forever
helene
who
loved
as
women
love
with
the
strength
or
rather
the
weakness
to
sacrifice
everything
to
that
love
could
not
understand
gaston
passive
submission
to
the
decrees
of
providence
and
she
would
have
preferred
to
have
seen
him
make
some
effort
to
combat
them
but
helene
was
in
this
unjust
to
gaston
the
same
ideas
tormented
him
he
knew
that
at
a
word
from
him
helene
would
follow
him
to
the
end
of
the
world
he
had
plenty
of
gold
it
would
be
easy
for
helene
one
evening
instead
of
going
to
rest
to
go
with
him
into
a
and
in
two
days
they
would
be
beyond
the
frontier
free
and
happy
not
for
a
day
or
a
month
but
forever
but
one
word
one
little
word
opposed
itself
to
all
this
that
word
was
honor
he
had
given
his
oath
and
he
would
be
disgraced
if
he
did
not
keep
it
the
last
evening
helene
expected
that
gaston
would
speak
but
in
vain
and
she
retired
to
rest
with
the
conviction
that
gaston
did
not
love
her
as
she
loved
him
that
night
gaston
never
slept
and
he
rose
pale
and
despairing
they
breakfasted
at
a
little
village
the
nun
thought
that
in
the
evening
she
would
begin
her
homeward
journey
toward
her
beloved
convent
helene
thought
that
it
was
now
too
late
to
act
even
if
gaston
should
speak
gaston
thought
that
he
was
about
to
lose
forever
the
woman
whom
he
loved
about
three
in
the
afternoon
they
all
alighted
to
walk
up
a
steep
hill
from
the
summit
of
which
they
could
see
before
them
a
steeple
and
a
number
of
houses
it
was
rambouillet
they
did
not
know
it
but
they
felt
that
it
was
gaston
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
there
said
he
our
paths
separate
helene
i
implore
you
preserve
the
recollection
of
me
and
whatever
happens
do
not
condemn
or
curse
me
gaston
you
only
speak
of
the
most
terrible
things
i
need
courage
and
you
take
it
from
me
have
you
nothing
joyful
to
tell
me
i
know
the
present
is
dark
but
is
the
future
also
as
dreadful
are
there
not
many
years
and
therefore
many
hopes
to
look
forward
to
we
are
young
we
love
one
another
are
there
no
means
of
struggling
against
the
fate
which
threatens
us
oh
gaston
i
feel
in
myself
a
great
strength
and
if
you
but
say
but
no
i
am
mad
it
is
i
who
suffer
and
yet
i
who
console
i
understand
you
helene
you
want
a
promise
do
you
not
well
judge
if
i
am
wretched
i
dare
not
promise
you
tell
me
to
hope
and
i
can
but
despair
if
i
had
ten
years
five
years
one
year
at
my
own
disposal
i
would
offer
them
to
you
helene
and
think
myself
blessed
but
from
the
moment
i
leave
you
we
lose
each
other
from
morning
i
belong
no
more
to
myself
oh
cried
helene
unhappy
that
i
am
did
you
then
deceive
me
when
you
said
you
loved
me
are
you
pledged
to
another
at
least
my
poor
helene
said
gaston
on
this
point
i
can
reassure
you
i
have
no
other
love
then
we
may
yet
be
happy
gaston
if
my
new
family
will
recognize
you
as
my
husband
helene
do
you
not
see
that
every
word
you
utter
stabs
me
to
the
heart
but
at
least
tell
me
what
it
is
fate
which
i
can
not
escape
ties
which
i
dare
not
break
i
know
of
none
such
cried
the
young
girl
i
am
promised
a
family
riches
station
and
a
name
and
yet
gaston
say
but
one
word
and
i
leave
them
all
for
you
why
then
will
you
not
do
as
much
for
me
gaston
answered
not
and
at
this
moment
sister
therese
rejoined
them
and
they
again
got
into
the
carriage
when
they
neared
the
town
the
nun
called
gaston
told
him
that
perhaps
some
one
might
come
to
meet
helene
and
that
a
stranger
should
not
be
seen
with
them
gaston
bowed
silently
and
sadly
and
turned
to
leave
them
helene
was
no
ordinary
woman
she
saw
gaston
distress
is
it
adieu
or
au
revoir
cried
she
boldly
au
revoir
said
gaston
and
he
rode
off
quickly
chapter
vi
a
room
in
the
hotel
at
rambouillet
gaston
went
away
without
saying
how
they
were
to
meet
again
but
helene
thought
that
he
would
certainty
manage
that
and
she
contented
herself
with
watching
him
as
long
as
she
could
ten
minutes
later
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
a
woman
who
was
waiting
came
out
hastily
and
respectfully
assisted
the
ladies
to
alight
and
then
guided
them
through
the
passages
of
the
hotel
preceded
by
a
valet
carrying
lights
a
door
opened
madame
desroches
drew
back
to
allow
helene
and
sister
therese
to
pass
and
they
soon
found
themselves
on
a
soft
and
easy
sofa
in
front
of
a
bright
fire
the
room
was
large
and
well
furnished
but
the
taste
was
severe
for
the
style
called
rococo
was
not
yet
introduced
there
were
four
doors
the
first
was
that
by
which
they
had
entered
the
second
led
to
the
which
was
already
lighted
and
warmed
the
third
led
into
a
bedroom
the
fourth
did
not
open
helene
admired
the
magnificence
of
all
around
her
the
quiet
and
respectful
manner
of
the
servants
while
sister
therese
rejoiced
when
she
saw
the
smoking
supper
that
it
was
not
a
fast
day
presently
madame
desroches
returned
and
approaching
the
sister
handed
her
a
letter
she
opened
it
and
read
as
follows
sister
therese
may
pass
the
night
at
rambouillet
or
leave
again
at
once
according
to
her
own
wish
she
will
receive
two
hundred
louis
offered
to
the
convent
by
helene
and
will
give
up
her
charge
to
the
care
of
madame
desroches
who
is
honored
by
the
confidence
of
parents
at
the
bottom
of
the
letter
instead
of
a
signature
was
a
cipher
which
the
sister
compared
with
that
on
a
letter
which
she
had
brought
from
clisson
the
identity
being
proved
my
child
said
she
i
leave
you
after
supper
so
soon
said
helene
to
whom
therese
was
now
the
only
link
to
her
past
life
yes
my
child
it
is
at
my
option
to
sleep
here
but
i
prefer
to
return
at
once
for
i
wish
to
be
again
at
home
where
the
only
thing
wanting
to
my
happiness
will
be
your
presence
helene
threw
herself
on
therese
neck
weeping
she
recalled
her
youth
passed
so
happily
among
affectionate
companions
and
she
again
saw
the
towers
and
steeples
of
her
former
residence
they
sat
down
to
table
and
sister
therese
hastily
partook
of
some
refreshment
then
embraced
helene
who
wished
to
accompany
her
to
the
carriage
but
madame
desroches
begged
her
not
to
do
so
as
the
hotel
was
full
of
strangers
helene
then
asked
permission
to
see
the
poor
gardener
who
had
been
their
escort
once
more
this
man
had
become
a
friend
to
her
and
she
quitted
him
and
therese
sadly
madame
desroches
seeing
that
helene
felt
vainly
in
her
pocket
said
does
mademoiselle
want
anything
yes
said
helene
i
should
wish
to
give
a
souvenir
to
this
good
man
madame
desroches
gave
helene
louis
and
she
without
counting
them
slipped
them
into
the
gardener
hand
who
overwhelmed
her
with
tears
and
thanks
at
length
they
were
forced
to
part
and
helene
hearing
the
sound
of
their
carriage
driving
away
threw
herself
on
a
sofa
weeping
madame
desroches
reminded
her
that
she
had
eaten
nothing
helene
insisted
that
she
should
sup
with
her
after
her
meal
she
showed
helene
her
bedroom
saying
will
mademoiselle
ring
when
she
requires
her
for
this
evening
mademoiselle
will
receive
a
visit
a
visit
cried
helene
yes
mademoiselle
from
a
relation
and
is
it
the
one
who
watches
over
me
from
your
birth
mademoiselle
oh
mon
dieu
cried
helene
and
he
is
coming
he
is
most
anxious
to
know
you
oh
murmured
helene
i
feel
as
if
i
should
faint
madame
desroches
ran
to
her
and
supported
her
do
you
feel
so
much
terror
asked
she
at
seeing
one
who
loves
you
it
is
not
terror
it
is
agitation
said
helene
i
did
not
know
that
it
would
be
and
this
important
news
quite
overcomes
me
but
i
have
not
told
you
all
this
person
is
necessarily
surrounded
by
mystery
why
so
i
am
forbidden
to
reply
to
that
question
mademoiselle
what
necessity
can
there
be
for
such
precautions
with
a
poor
orphan
like
me
they
are
necessary
believe
me
but
in
what
do
they
consist
firstly
you
may
not
see
the
face
of
this
person
so
that
you
may
not
recognize
him
if
you
meet
him
in
the
world
then
he
will
come
masked
no
mademoiselle
but
the
lights
will
be
extinguished
then
we
shall
be
in
darkness
yes
but
you
will
remain
with
me
madame
desroches
no
mademoiselle
that
is
expressly
forbidden
by
whom
by
the
person
who
is
coming
but
do
you
then
owe
such
absolute
obedience
to
this
person
more
than
that
mademoiselle
i
owe
him
the
deepest
respect
is
he
then
of
such
high
station
he
is
of
the
very
highest
in
france
and
he
is
my
relation
the
nearest
for
heaven
sake
madame
desroches
do
not
leave
me
in
uncertainty
on
this
point
i
have
already
told
you
mademoiselle
that
there
are
some
questions
to
which
i
am
expressly
forbidden
to
reply
and
she
was
about
to
retire
why
do
you
leave
me
asked
helene
i
leave
you
to
your
toilet
but
madame
madame
desroches
made
a
low
ceremonious
curtsey
and
went
out
of
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
her
chapter
vii
a
servant
in
the
royal
monseigneur
le
duc
while
the
things
which
we
have
related
were
passing
in
the
parlor
of
the
hotel
in
another
apartment
of
the
same
hotel
seated
near
a
large
fire
was
a
man
shaking
the
snow
from
his
boots
and
untying
the
strings
of
a
large
portfolio
this
man
was
dressed
in
the
hunting
livery
of
the
house
of
orleans
the
coat
red
and
silver
large
boots
and
a
hat
trimmed
with
silver
he
had
a
quick
eye
a
long
pointed
nose
a
round
and
open
forehead
which
was
contradicted
by
thin
and
compressed
lips
this
man
murmured
to
himself
some
phrases
which
he
interrupted
by
oaths
and
exclamations
which
seemed
less
the
result
of
words
than
thoughts
come
come
said
he
de
montaran
did
not
deceive
me
and
our
bretons
are
hard
at
the
work
but
for
what
earthly
reason
can
he
have
come
by
such
short
stages
he
left
at
noon
on
the
and
only
arrived
on
the
evening
of
the
this
probably
hides
some
new
mystery
which
will
be
explained
by
the
fellow
recommended
by
montaran
and
with
whom
my
people
were
in
communication
on
the
journey
hola
and
he
rang
a
silver
bell
a
man
dressed
in
gray
like
those
we
have
seen
on
the
route
appeared
ah
it
is
you
tapin
yes
monseigneur
the
affair
being
important
i
thought
it
better
to
come
myself
have
you
questioned
the
men
you
placed
on
the
road
yes
monseigneur
but
they
know
nothing
but
the
places
at
which
our
conspirators
stopped
in
fact
that
is
all
they
were
told
to
learn
i
will
try
to
learn
from
the
servant
what
sort
of
man
is
he
oh
a
mischievous
simpleton
half
norman
half
breton
a
bad
fellow
what
is
he
about
now
serving
his
master
supper
whom
i
hope
they
have
placed
as
i
desired
yes
monseigneur
in
a
room
without
curtains
yes
monseigneur
and
you
have
made
a
hole
in
the
shutter
yes
monseigneur
well
then
send
me
the
servant
and
remain
within
call
the
man
in
the
red
coat
consulted
his
watch
eight
said
he
at
this
hour
monseigneur
the
regent
returns
to
germains
and
asks
for
dubois
as
dubois
is
not
there
he
rubs
his
hands
and
prepares
for
some
folly
rub
your
hands
philippe
and
amuse
yourself
at
your
pleasure
for
the
danger
is
not
at
paris
but
here
we
shall
see
if
you
will
laugh
at
my
secret
police
this
time
ah
here
is
our
man
at
this
moment
tapin
introduced
owen
here
is
the
person
you
wished
to
see
said
he
owen
remained
standing
trembling
near
the
door
while
dubois
wrapped
himself
in
a
large
cloak
which
left
only
the
upper
part
of
his
face
visible
to
him
on
whom
he
fixed
his
eyes
approach
my
friend
said
dubois
in
spite
of
the
cordiality
of
this
invitation
it
was
given
in
so
harsh
a
voice
that
owen
would
have
preferred
being
at
a
greater
distance
from
this
man
who
looked
at
him
so
strangely
well
fellow
said
dubois
seeing
that
he
did
not
stir
did
you
not
hear
me
yes
monseigneur
said
owen
then
why
do
you
not
obey
i
did
not
know
you
spoke
to
me
and
owen
then
stepped
forward
you
have
received
fifty
louis
to
speak
the
truth
to
me
continued
dubois
pardon
monseigneur
said
owen
who
began
to
recover
his
composure
i
have
not
received
them
they
were
promised
to
me
but
dubois
took
a
handful
of
gold
from
his
pocket
counted
fifty
louis
and
placed
them
in
a
pile
on
the
table
owen
looked
at
the
pile
with
an
expression
of
which
one
would
have
supposed
his
dull
countenance
incapable
good
thought
dubois
he
is
avaricious
in
reality
the
fifty
louis
had
always
appeared
very
doubtful
to
owen
he
had
betrayed
his
master
with
scarcely
a
hope
of
obtaining
his
reward
and
now
the
promised
gold
was
before
his
eyes
may
i
take
them
asked
owen
spreading
his
hand
toward
them
wait
a
moment
said
dubois
who
amused
himself
by
exciting
that
cupidity
which
any
but
a
peasant
would
have
concealed
we
will
make
a
bargain
what
is
it
asked
owen
here
are
the
fifty
louis
i
see
them
said
owen
passing
his
tongue
over
his
lips
like
a
thirsty
dog
at
every
answer
you
make
to
a
question
of
mine
i
either
add
ten
louis
if
it
is
important
or
take
them
away
if
it
is
unimportant
and
stupid
owen
started
he
did
not
like
the
terms
now
said
dubois
let
us
talk
what
place
have
you
come
from
direct
from
nantes
with
whom
with
the
chevalier
gaston
de
chanlay
these
being
preliminary
questions
the
pile
remained
undisturbed
listen
said
dubois
i
am
all
attention
did
your
master
travel
under
his
own
name
he
set
out
in
his
own
name
but
changed
it
on
the
journey
what
name
did
he
take
de
livry
dubois
added
ten
louis
but
as
they
would
not
stand
on
the
others
he
commenced
a
second
pile
owen
uttered
a
joyful
cry
oh
said
dubois
do
not
exult
yet
we
are
not
near
the
end
is
there
a
de
livry
at
nantes
no
monseigneur
but
there
is
a
demoiselle
de
livry
who
is
she
the
wife
of
de
montlouis
an
intimate
friend
of
my
master
good
said
dubois
adding
ten
louis
and
what
was
your
master
doing
at
nantes
what
most
young
men
do
he
hunted
danced
and
so
on
dubois
took
away
ten
louis
owen
shuddered
stop
said
he
he
did
something
else
ah
what
was
that
i
do
not
know
replied
owen
dubois
held
the
ten
louis
in
his
hand
and
since
his
departure
what
has
he
done
he
passed
through
oudon
ancenis
le
mans
nogent
and
chartres
dubois
stretched
out
his
hand
and
took
up
another
ten
louis
owen
uttered
a
dolorous
cry
and
did
he
make
no
acquaintance
on
the
route
yes
with
a
young
lady
from
the
augustine
convent
at
clisson
who
was
traveling
with
a
sister
of
the
convent
named
therese
and
what
was
the
young
lady
called
mademoiselle
helene
de
chaverny
helene
a
promising
name
doubtless
she
is
your
master
mistress
i
do
not
know
said
owen
he
would
not
have
told
me
he
is
a
shrewd
fellow
said
dubois
taking
ten
louis
from
the
fifty
owen
trembled
four
such
answers
and
he
would
have
betrayed
his
master
for
nothing
and
these
ladies
are
going
to
paris
with
him
no
monseigneur
they
stop
at
rambouillet
ah
said
dubois
the
tone
of
this
exclamation
gave
owen
some
hope
come
said
dubois
all
this
is
not
very
important
but
one
must
encourage
beginners
and
he
added
ten
louis
to
the
pile
sister
therese
continued
owen
is
already
gone
home
so
that
the
young
lady
remains
alone
no
answered
owen
how
so
a
lady
from
paris
awaited
her
from
paris
yes
do
you
know
her
name
i
heard
sister
therese
call
her
madame
desroches
madame
desroches
cried
dubois
and
he
began
another
pile
with
ten
louis
yes
replied
owen
delighted
are
you
sure
of
course
i
am
she
is
a
tall
thin
woman
dubois
added
ten
louis
owen
thought
that
if
he
had
made
an
interval
between
each
adjective
he
might
have
had
twenty
louis
thin
tall
yellow
repeated
dubois
just
so
from
forty
to
added
owen
exactly
said
dubois
adding
ten
louis
in
a
silk
dress
with
large
flowers
on
it
very
good
said
dubois
owen
saw
that
his
questioner
knew
enough
about
the
lady
and
waited
and
you
say
that
your
master
made
acquaintance
with
the
young
lady
en
route
yes
monsieur
but
i
think
it
was
a
farce
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
they
knew
each
other
before
and
i
am
sure
of
one
thing
that
my
master
waited
for
her
three
hours
at
oudon
bravo
said
dubois
adding
ten
louis
we
shall
make
something
of
you
you
do
not
wish
to
know
anything
more
then
asked
owen
extending
his
hand
toward
the
two
piles
of
gold
stop
said
dubois
is
the
young
lady
pretty
beautiful
as
an
angel
answered
owen
and
no
doubt
they
made
an
appointment
to
meet
in
paris
no
monsieur
i
think
they
said
adieu
forever
another
farce
i
do
not
think
so
monsieur
my
master
was
so
sad
when
they
separated
and
they
are
not
to
meet
again
yes
once
more
i
think
and
all
will
be
over
well
take
your
money
and
remember
that
if
you
mention
one
word
of
this
in
ten
minutes
you
will
be
a
dead
man
owen
snatched
the
money
which
disappeared
in
his
pocket
instantly
and
now
said
he
may
i
go
no
idiot
from
this
moment
you
belong
to
me
for
i
have
bought
you
and
you
will
be
more
useful
to
me
at
paris
than
elsewhere
in
that
case
i
will
remain
monsieur
i
promise
there
is
no
need
to
promise
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
tapin
appeared
looking
very
much
agitated
what
has
happened
now
asked
dubois
something
very
important
monseigneur
but
send
away
this
man
return
to
your
master
said
dubois
and
if
he
writes
to
any
one
whatever
remember
that
i
am
most
anxious
to
see
his
writing
owen
went
out
delighted
to
be
set
free
well
tapin
said
dubois
what
is
it
monseigneur
after
the
hunt
at
germains
his
royal
highness
instead
of
returning
to
paris
sent
away
every
one
and
gave
orders
to
proceed
to
rambouillet
the
regent
coming
to
rambouillet
he
will
be
here
in
half
an
hour
and
would
have
been
here
now
if
hunger
had
not
luckily
obliged
him
to
enter
the
chateau
and
procure
some
refreshment
and
what
is
he
coming
to
rambouillet
for
i
do
not
know
monseigneur
unless
it
be
for
the
young
girl
who
has
just
arrived
with
a
nun
and
who
is
now
in
the
pavilion
of
the
hotel
you
are
right
tapin
it
is
doubtless
for
her
and
madame
desroches
too
did
you
know
that
madame
desroches
was
here
no
monseigneur
i
did
not
and
are
you
sure
that
your
information
is
correct
my
dear
tapin
oh
monseigneur
it
was
from
whom
i
placed
near
his
royal
highness
and
what
he
says
is
gospel
truth
you
are
right
said
dubois
who
seemed
to
know
the
qualities
of
this
man
if
it
be
there
is
no
doubt
the
poor
fellow
has
lamed
his
horse
which
fell
near
rambouillet
thirty
louis
for
the
horse
he
may
gain
what
he
can
of
it
tapin
took
the
thirty
louis
you
know
the
situation
of
the
pavilion
do
you
not
perfectly
where
is
it
one
side
looks
on
the
second
courtyard
the
other
on
a
deserted
lane
place
men
in
the
courtyard
and
in
the
lane
disguised
as
stablemen
or
how
you
please
let
no
one
enter
the
pavilion
but
monseigneur
and
myself
the
life
of
his
royal
highness
is
at
stake
rest
easy
monseigneur
do
you
know
our
breton
i
saw
him
dismount
do
your
men
know
him
they
all
saw
him
on
the
road
well
i
recommend
him
to
you
shall
we
arrest
him
certainly
not
he
must
be
allowed
to
go
where
he
pleases
and
act
as
he
pleases
and
he
must
have
every
opportunity
to
do
so
if
he
were
arrested
now
he
would
tell
nothing
and
our
plans
would
be
disconcerted
no
no
these
plans
must
hatch
hatch
what
monseigneur
said
tapin
who
appeared
to
be
on
confidential
terms
with
dubois
my
archbishop
miter
lecocq
said
dubois
and
now
to
your
work
i
go
to
mine
both
left
the
room
and
descended
the
staircase
but
separated
at
the
door
lecocq
went
along
the
rue
de
paris
and
dubois
slipping
along
by
the
wall
went
to
peep
through
the
hole
in
the
shutter
chapter
viii
the
utility
of
a
seal
gaston
had
just
supped
for
at
his
age
whether
a
man
be
in
despair
or
in
love
nature
asserts
her
rights
he
was
leaning
on
the
table
thoughtfully
the
lamp
threw
a
light
over
his
face
and
enabled
dubois
to
gratify
his
curiosity
he
looked
at
him
with
an
attention
almost
alarming
his
quick
eye
darted
his
lip
curled
with
a
smile
which
gave
one
the
idea
of
a
demon
smiling
at
the
sight
of
one
of
those
victims
who
seem
to
have
vowed
their
own
perdition
while
looking
he
murmured
young
handsome
black
eyes
proud
lips
he
is
a
breton
he
is
not
corrupted
like
the
conspirators
of
cellamare
by
the
soft
glances
of
the
ladies
at
court
then
the
other
spoke
of
carrying
off
dethroning
but
this
one
this
one
and
yet
continued
he
after
a
pause
i
look
in
vain
for
traces
of
cunning
on
that
open
brow
i
see
no
machiavelism
in
the
corners
of
that
mouth
so
full
of
loyalty
and
honor
yet
no
doubt
all
is
arranged
to
surprise
the
regent
on
his
visit
to
this
clisson
demoiselle
who
will
say
again
that
bretons
have
dull
brains
no
said
dubois
after
another
pause
it
can
not
be
so
it
is
impossible
that
this
young
man
with
his
calm
sad
face
should
be
ready
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
kill
a
man
and
that
man
the
first
prince
of
the
blood
no
i
can
not
believe
in
such
and
yet
the
regent
has
kept
this
amourette
secret
even
from
me
he
goes
out
to
hunt
at
germains
announces
aloud
that
he
shall
sleep
at
the
palais
royal
then
all
at
once
gives
counter
orders
and
drives
to
rambouillet
at
rambouillet
the
young
girl
waits
and
is
received
by
madame
desroches
who
can
she
be
watching
for
if
not
for
the
regent
and
this
young
girl
is
the
mistress
of
the
chevalier
but
is
she
ah
we
must
learn
we
must
find
out
how
far
we
can
depend
on
owen
and
dubois
left
his
observatory
and
waited
on
the
staircase
he
was
quite
hidden
in
the
shade
and
he
could
see
gaston
door
in
the
light
the
door
presently
opened
and
owen
appeared
he
held
a
letter
in
his
hands
and
after
hesitating
a
minute
he
appeared
to
have
taken
his
determination
and
mounted
the
staircase
good
said
dubois
he
has
tasted
the
forbidden
fruit
and
he
is
mine
then
stopping
owen
give
me
the
letter
which
you
were
bringing
me
and
wait
here
how
did
you
know
i
had
a
letter
asked
owen
bewildered
dubois
shrugged
his
shoulders
took
the
letter
and
disappeared
in
his
room
he
examined
the
seal
the
chevalier
who
had
no
wax
had
used
that
on
the
bottle
and
had
sealed
it
with
the
stone
of
a
ring
dubois
held
the
letter
above
the
candle
and
the
wax
melted
he
opened
the
letter
and
read
dear
helene
your
courage
has
doubled
mine
manage
so
that
i
can
enter
the
house
and
you
shall
know
my
plans
oh
said
dubois
it
seems
she
does
not
know
them
yet
things
are
not
as
far
advanced
as
i
supposed
he
resealed
the
letter
with
one
of
the
numerous
rings
which
he
wore
and
which
resembled
that
of
the
chevalier
and
calling
owen
here
said
he
is
your
master
letter
deliver
it
faithfully
bring
me
the
answer
and
you
shall
have
ten
louis
ah
thought
owen
has
this
man
a
mine
of
gold
and
he
went
off
ten
minutes
after
he
returned
with
the
reply
it
was
on
scented
and
ornamented
paper
sealed
with
the
letter
dubois
opened
a
box
took
out
a
kind
of
paste
in
which
he
was
about
to
take
the
impression
of
the
seal
when
he
observed
that
from
the
manner
in
which
it
was
folded
he
could
read
it
without
opening
it
was
as
follows
the
person
who
sent
for
me
at
bretagne
is
coming
to
meet
me
here
instead
of
waiting
at
paris
so
impatient
is
he
i
am
told
to
see
me
i
think
he
will
leave
again
come
morning
before
nine
i
will
tell
you
all
that
has
passed
and
then
we
can
arrange
how
to
act
this
said
dubois
still
taking
helene
for
the
chevalier
accomplice
makes
it
clearer
if
this
is
the
way
they
bring
up
young
ladies
at
clisson
i
congratulate
them
and
monseigneur
who
from
her
age
concludes
her
to
be
simple
and
ingenuous
here
said
he
to
owen
here
is
the
letter
and
your
ten
louis
owen
took
them
at
this
moment
ten
struck
and
the
rolling
of
a
carriage
was
heard
dubois
went
to
the
window
and
saw
it
stop
at
the
hotel
door
in
the
carriage
was
a
gentleman
whom
dubois
at
once
recognized
as
lafare
captain
of
his
royal
highness
guards
well
said
he
he
is
more
prudent
than
i
thought
but
where
is
he
ah
this
exclamation
was
uttered
at
the
sight
of
a
man
dressed
in
the
same
red
livery
which
he
himself
concealed
under
his
cloak
and
who
followed
the
carriage
mounted
on
a
superb
spanish
jenet
which
however
he
could
not
have
ridden
long
for
while
the
carriage
horses
were
covered
with
foam
this
one
was
quite
fresh
lafare
at
once
demanded
a
room
and
supper
meanwhile
the
man
dismounted
threw
the
reins
to
a
page
and
went
toward
the
pavilion
well
said
dubois
all
this
is
as
clear
as
a
mountain
stream
but
how
is
it
that
the
face
of
the
chevalier
does
not
appear
is
he
too
much
occupied
with
his
chicken
to
have
heard
the
carriage
let
us
see
as
to
you
monseigneur
continued
dubois
be
assured
i
will
not
disturb
your
enjoy
at
your
pleasure
this
commencement
of
ingenuity
which
promises
such
happy
results
ah
monseigneur
it
is
certain
that
you
are
dubois
went
down
and
again
took
up
his
post
at
his
observatory
as
he
approached
it
gaston
rose
after
putting
his
note
in
his
ah
said
dubois
i
must
have
that
i
would
pay
high
for
it
he
is
going
out
he
buckles
on
his
sword
he
looks
for
his
cloak
where
is
he
going
let
us
see
to
wait
for
his
royal
highness
exit
no
no
that
is
not
the
face
of
a
man
who
is
going
to
kill
another
i
could
sooner
believe
he
was
about
to
spend
the
evening
under
the
windows
of
his
sweetheart
ah
if
he
had
that
idea
it
would
be
a
means
it
would
be
difficult
to
render
the
expression
which
passed
over
the
face
of
dubois
at
this
moment
yes
but
if
i
were
to
get
a
in
the
enterprise
how
monseigneur
would
laugh
bah
there
is
no
danger
our
men
are
at
their
post
and
besides
nothing
venture
nothing
gain
encouraged
by
this
reflection
dubois
made
the
circuit
of
the
hotel
in
order
to
appear
at
one
end
of
the
little
lane
as
gaston
appeared
at
the
other
as
he
had
expected
at
the
end
of
the
lane
he
found
tapin
who
had
placed
in
the
courtyard
in
two
words
he
explained
his
project
tapin
pointed
out
to
dubois
one
man
leaning
on
the
step
of
an
outer
door
a
second
was
playing
a
kind
of
jew
harp
and
seemed
an
itinerant
musician
and
there
was
another
too
well
hidden
to
be
seen
dubois
thus
sure
of
support
returned
into
the
lane
he
soon
perceived
a
figure
at
the
other
end
and
at
once
recognized
the
chevalier
who
was
too
thoughtful
even
to
notice
that
he
was
passing
any
one
dubois
wanted
a
quarrel
and
he
saw
that
he
must
take
the
initiative
he
turned
and
stopped
before
the
chevalier
who
was
trying
to
discover
which
were
the
windows
of
the
room
in
which
helene
was
my
friend
said
he
roughly
what
are
you
doing
at
this
hour
before
this
house
gaston
was
obliged
to
bring
back
his
thoughts
to
the
materialism
of
life
did
you
speak
to
me
monsieur
said
he
yes
replied
dubois
i
asked
what
you
were
doing
here
pass
on
said
the
chevalier
i
do
not
interfere
with
you
do
not
interfere
with
me
that
might
be
said
dubois
if
your
presence
did
not
annoy
me
this
lane
narrow
as
it
is
is
wide
enough
for
both
monsieur
walk
on
one
side
and
i
will
walk
on
the
other
i
wish
to
walk
alone
said
dubois
therefore
i
beg
you
will
choose
some
other
window
there
are
plenty
at
rambouillet
to
choose
from
and
why
should
i
not
look
at
these
windows
if
i
choose
asked
chanlay
because
they
are
those
of
my
wife
replied
of
your
wife
yes
of
my
wife
who
has
just
arrived
from
paris
and
of
whom
i
am
jealous
i
warn
you
diable
murmured
gaston
he
must
be
the
husband
of
the
person
to
whom
helene
has
been
given
in
charge
and
in
order
to
conciliate
a
person
who
might
be
useful
to
him
monsieur
said
he
politely
in
that
case
i
am
willing
to
leave
a
place
where
i
was
walking
without
any
object
in
view
oh
thought
dubois
here
is
a
polite
conspirator
i
must
have
a
quarrel
gaston
was
going
away
you
are
deceiving
me
monsieur
said
dubois
the
chevalier
turned
as
though
he
had
been
bitten
by
a
serpent
however
prudent
for
the
sake
of
helene
and
for
the
mission
he
had
undertaken
he
restrained
himself
is
it
said
he
because
i
was
polite
that
you
disbelieve
my
word
you
spoke
politely
because
you
were
afraid
but
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
i
saw
you
looking
at
that
window
afraid
i
afraid
cried
chanlay
facing
him
did
you
say
that
i
was
afraid
i
did
replied
dubois
do
you
then
seek
a
quarrel
it
appears
so
i
see
you
come
from
quimper
corentin
said
gaston
drawing
his
sword
draw
and
you
off
with
your
coat
said
dubois
throwing
off
his
cloak
and
preparing
to
do
the
same
with
his
coat
why
so
asked
the
chevalier
because
i
do
not
know
you
monsieur
and
because
those
who
walk
at
night
frequently
have
their
coat
prudently
lined
with
a
shirt
of
mail
at
these
words
the
chevalier
cloak
and
coat
were
thrown
aside
but
at
the
moment
when
gaston
was
about
to
rush
on
his
adversary
the
four
men
appeared
and
seized
him
a
duel
monsieur
cried
they
in
spite
of
the
king
prohibition
and
they
dragged
him
toward
the
door
an
assassination
murmured
gaston
not
daring
to
cry
out
for
fear
of
compromising
helene
cowards
we
are
betrayed
monsieur
said
dubois
rolling
up
gaston
cloak
and
coat
and
putting
them
under
his
arm
we
shall
meet
again
no
doubt
and
he
ran
toward
the
hotel
while
they
shut
up
gaston
in
the
lower
room
dubois
ran
up
the
staircase
and
into
his
room
where
he
opened
the
precious
he
found
in
one
pocket
a
broken
coin
and
a
name
this
coin
was
evidently
a
sign
of
recognition
and
the
name
was
probably
that
of
the
man
to
whom
gaston
was
addressed
and
who
was
called
captain
la
jonquiere
the
paper
was
oddly
folded
la
jonquiere
said
dubois
we
have
our
eyes
on
already
he
looked
over
the
rest
of
the
there
was
nothing
it
is
little
said
dubois
but
it
is
enough
he
folded
a
paper
like
the
other
took
the
name
and
rang
the
bell
some
one
knocked
the
door
was
fastened
inside
i
forgot
said
dubois
opening
it
and
giving
entrance
to
monsieur
tapin
what
have
you
done
with
him
he
is
in
the
lower
room
and
watched
take
back
his
cloak
and
coat
to
the
place
where
he
threw
them
make
your
excuses
and
set
him
free
take
care
that
everything
is
in
his
pockets
so
that
he
may
suspect
nothing
bring
me
my
coat
and
cloak
monsieur
tapin
bowed
low
and
went
to
obey
his
orders
chapter
ix
the
visit
all
this
passed
as
we
have
said
in
the
lane
under
helene
windows
she
had
heard
the
noise
and
as
among
the
voices
she
thought
she
distinguished
that
of
the
chevalier
she
ran
anxiously
to
the
window
when
at
the
same
moment
madame
desroches
appeared
she
came
to
beg
helene
to
go
into
the
as
the
visitor
had
arrived
helene
started
and
nearly
fell
her
voice
failed
her
and
she
followed
silent
and
trembling
the
room
into
which
madame
desroches
led
her
was
without
any
light
except
what
was
thrown
on
the
carpet
by
the
last
remains
of
a
fire
madame
desroches
threw
some
water
over
the
flame
and
left
the
room
entirely
dark
begging
helene
to
have
no
fear
madame
desroches
withdrew
the
instant
after
helene
heard
a
voice
behind
the
fourth
door
which
had
not
yet
opened
she
started
at
the
sound
and
involuntarily
made
a
few
steps
toward
the
door
is
she
ready
said
the
voice
yes
monseigneur
was
the
reply
monseigneur
murmured
helene
who
is
coming
then
is
she
alone
yes
monseigneur
is
she
aware
of
my
arrival
yes
monseigneur
we
shall
not
be
interrupted
monseigneur
may
rely
upon
me
and
no
light
none
whatever
the
steps
approached
then
stopped
speak
frankly
madame
desroches
said
the
voice
is
she
as
pretty
as
they
said
more
beautiful
than
your
highness
can
imagine
your
highness
who
can
he
be
thought
helene
much
agitated
at
this
moment
the
door
creaked
on
its
hinges
and
a
heavy
step
approached
mademoiselle
said
the
voice
i
beg
you
to
receive
and
hear
me
i
am
here
said
helene
faintly
are
you
frightened
i
confess
it
mon
shall
i
say
or
say
friend
at
this
moment
her
hand
touched
that
of
the
unknown
madame
desroches
are
you
there
asked
helene
drawing
back
madame
desroches
said
the
voice
tell
mademoiselle
that
she
is
as
safe
as
in
a
temple
before
god
ah
monseigneur
i
am
at
your
feet
pardon
me
rise
my
child
and
seat
yourself
there
madame
desroches
close
all
the
doors
and
now
continued
he
give
me
your
hand
i
beg
helene
hand
again
met
that
of
the
stranger
and
this
time
it
was
not
withdrawn
he
seems
to
tremble
also
murmured
she
tell
me
are
you
afraid
dear
child
no
replied
helene
but
when
your
hand
clasps
mine
a
strange
thrill
passes
through
me
speak
to
me
helene
said
the
unknown
with
an
expression
of
tenderness
i
know
already
that
you
are
beautiful
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
heard
your
voice
speak
i
am
listening
but
have
you
seen
me
then
asked
helene
do
you
remember
that
two
years
ago
the
abbess
had
your
portrait
taken
yes
i
remember
an
artist
came
expressly
from
paris
it
was
i
who
sent
him
and
was
the
portrait
for
you
it
is
here
said
the
unknown
taking
from
his
pocket
a
miniature
which
helene
could
feel
though
she
could
not
see
it
but
what
interest
could
you
have
in
the
portrait
of
a
poor
orphan
helene
i
am
your
father
friend
my
father
is
he
alive
yes
shall
i
ever
see
him
perhaps
oh
said
helene
pressing
the
stranger
hand
i
bless
you
for
bringing
me
this
news
dear
child
said
he
but
if
he
be
alive
said
helene
why
has
he
not
sought
out
his
child
he
had
news
of
you
every
month
and
though
at
a
distance
watched
over
you
and
yet
said
helene
reproachfully
he
has
not
seen
me
for
sixteen
years
believe
me
none
but
the
most
important
reasons
would
have
induced
him
to
deprive
himself
of
this
pleasure
i
believe
you
monsieur
it
is
not
for
me
to
accuse
my
father
no
it
is
for
you
to
pardon
him
if
he
accuses
himself
to
pardon
him
cried
helene
yes
and
this
pardon
which
he
can
not
ask
for
himself
i
ask
in
his
name
monsieur
said
helene
i
do
not
understand
you
listen
then
and
give
me
back
your
hand
here
it
is
your
father
was
an
officer
in
the
king
service
at
the
battle
of
nerwinden
where
he
charged
at
the
head
of
the
king
household
troops
one
of
his
followers
called
de
chaverny
fell
near
him
pierced
by
a
ball
your
father
wished
to
assist
him
but
the
wound
was
mortal
and
the
wounded
man
who
knew
that
it
was
so
said
not
of
me
but
of
my
child
your
father
pressed
his
hand
as
a
promise
and
the
man
fell
back
and
died
as
though
he
only
waited
this
assurance
to
close
his
eyes
you
are
listening
are
you
not
helene
oh
need
you
ask
such
a
question
said
the
young
girl
at
the
end
of
the
campaign
your
father
first
care
was
for
the
little
orphan
she
was
a
charming
child
of
from
ten
to
twelve
years
who
promised
to
be
as
beautiful
as
you
are
the
death
of
de
chaverny
her
father
left
her
without
support
or
fortune
your
father
placed
her
at
the
convent
of
the
faubourg
saint
antoine
and
announced
that
at
a
proper
age
he
should
give
her
a
dowry
i
thank
god
cried
helene
for
having
made
me
the
child
of
a
man
who
so
nobly
kept
his
promise
wait
helene
said
the
unknown
for
now
comes
the
time
when
your
father
will
not
receive
your
praises
helene
was
silent
the
unknown
continued
your
father
indeed
watched
over
the
orphan
till
her
eighteenth
year
she
was
an
adorable
young
girl
and
his
visits
to
the
convent
became
longer
and
more
frequent
than
they
should
have
been
your
father
began
to
love
his
protegée
at
first
he
was
frightened
at
his
own
love
for
he
remembered
his
promise
to
her
dying
father
he
begged
the
superior
to
look
for
a
suitable
husband
for
mademoiselle
de
chaverny
and
was
told
that
her
nephew
a
young
breton
having
seen
her
loved
her
and
wished
to
obtain
her
hand
well
monsieur
asked
helene
hearing
that
the
unknown
hesitated
to
proceed
well
your
father
surprise
was
great
helene
when
he
learned
from
the
superior
that
mademoiselle
de
chaverny
had
replied
that
she
did
not
wish
to
marry
and
that
her
greatest
desire
was
to
remain
in
the
convent
where
she
had
been
brought
up
and
that
the
happiest
day
of
her
life
would
be
that
on
which
she
should
pronounce
her
vows
she
loved
some
one
said
helene
yes
my
child
you
are
right
alas
we
can
not
avoid
our
fate
mademoiselle
de
chaverny
loved
your
father
for
a
long
time
she
kept
her
secret
but
one
day
when
your
father
begged
her
to
renounce
her
strange
wish
to
take
the
veil
the
poor
child
confessed
all
strong
against
his
love
when
he
did
not
believe
it
returned
he
succumbed
when
he
found
he
had
but
to
desire
and
to
obtain
they
were
both
so
young
your
father
scarcely
she
not
eighteen
they
forgot
the
world
and
only
remembered
that
they
could
be
happy
but
since
they
loved
said
helene
why
did
they
not
marry
union
was
impossible
on
account
of
the
distance
which
separated
them
do
you
not
know
that
your
father
is
of
high
station
alas
yes
said
helene
i
know
it
during
a
year
continued
he
their
happiness
surpassed
their
hopes
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
you
came
into
the
world
and
then
well
asked
the
young
girl
timidly
your
birth
cost
your
mother
life
helene
sobbed
yes
continued
the
unknown
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
yes
helene
weep
for
your
mother
she
was
a
noble
woman
of
whom
through
his
griefs
his
pleasures
even
his
follies
your
father
retains
a
tender
recollection
he
transferred
to
you
all
his
love
for
her
and
yet
said
helene
he
consented
to
remove
me
from
him
and
has
never
again
seen
me
helene
on
this
point
pardon
your
father
for
it
was
not
his
fault
you
were
born
in
at
the
most
austere
period
of
louis
xiv
reign
your
father
was
already
out
of
favor
with
the
king
or
rather
with
madame
de
maintenon
and
for
your
sake
as
much
or
more
than
for
his
he
sent
you
into
bretagne
confiding
you
to
mother
ursula
superior
of
the
convent
where
you
were
brought
up
at
length
louis
xiv
being
dead
and
everything
having
changed
through
all
france
it
is
decided
to
bring
you
nearer
to
him
during
the
journey
however
you
must
have
seen
that
his
care
was
over
you
and
when
he
knew
that
you
were
at
rambouillet
he
could
not
wait
till
he
is
come
to
you
here
helene
oh
mon
dieu
cried
helene
is
this
true
and
in
seeing
or
rather
in
listening
to
you
he
thinks
he
hears
your
mother
the
same
accent
in
the
voice
helene
helene
that
you
may
be
happier
than
she
was
is
his
heartfelt
prayer
oh
heavens
cried
helene
this
emotion
your
trembling
hand
monsieur
you
said
my
father
is
come
to
meet
me
yes
here
at
rambouillet
yes
you
say
he
is
happy
to
see
me
again
oh
yes
very
happy
but
this
happiness
was
not
enough
is
it
not
so
he
wished
to
speak
to
me
to
tell
me
himself
the
story
of
my
life
that
i
may
thank
him
for
his
love
that
i
may
fall
at
his
feet
that
i
may
ask
his
blessing
oh
cried
helene
kneeling
oh
i
am
at
your
feet
bless
me
father
helene
my
child
my
daughter
cried
the
unknown
not
at
my
feet
but
in
my
arms
my
father
my
father
was
helene
only
reply
and
yet
continued
he
i
came
with
a
different
intention
prepared
to
deny
all
to
remain
a
stranger
to
you
but
having
you
so
near
me
pressing
your
hand
hearing
your
voice
i
had
not
the
strength
but
do
not
make
me
repent
my
weakness
and
let
secrecy
i
swear
by
my
mother
grave
cried
helene
that
is
all
i
desire
cried
the
unknown
now
listen
for
i
must
leave
you
what
already
it
must
be
so
speak
then
my
father
i
am
ready
to
obey
you
you
leave
for
paris
there
is
a
house
there
destined
for
you
madame
desroches
will
take
you
there
and
at
the
very
first
moment
that
i
can
do
so
i
will
come
there
to
see
you
soon
i
hope
for
do
not
forget
that
i
am
alone
in
the
world
as
soon
as
possible
and
pressing
his
lips
to
helene
forehead
the
unknown
imprinted
on
it
one
of
those
kisses
as
sweet
to
the
heart
of
a
father
as
a
kiss
of
love
to
the
heart
of
a
lover
ten
minutes
later
madame
desroches
entered
with
a
light
helene
was
on
her
knees
praying
without
rising
she
signed
to
madame
desroches
to
place
the
light
on
the
which
that
lady
did
and
then
retired
helene
after
praying
for
some
time
rose
and
looked
around
her
as
though
for
some
evidence
that
the
whole
was
not
a
dream
her
own
emotion
however
assured
her
that
it
was
really
a
great
event
in
her
life
which
had
taken
place
then
the
thought
of
gaston
rose
to
her
mind
this
father
whom
she
had
so
dreaded
to
see
this
father
who
himself
had
loved
so
ardently
and
suffered
so
deeply
would
not
do
violence
to
her
love
besides
gaston
was
a
scion
of
an
ancient
house
and
beyond
all
this
she
loved
him
so
that
she
would
die
if
she
were
separated
from
him
and
her
father
would
not
wish
her
death
the
obstacles
on
gaston
side
could
be
but
the
right
and
would
doubtless
be
easily
overcome
and
helene
fell
asleep
to
dream
of
a
happy
and
smiling
future
gaston
on
his
part
set
at
liberty
with
many
apologies
from
those
who
pretended
to
have
mistaken
him
for
another
person
went
back
to
fetch
his
coat
and
cloak
which
he
was
overjoyed
to
find
where
he
had
left
them
he
anxiously
opened
his
it
was
as
he
had
left
it
and
for
greater
safety
he
now
burned
the
address
of
la
jonquiere
he
gave
his
orders
for
the
next
day
to
owen
and
retired
meanwhile
two
carriages
rolled
away
from
the
door
of
the
in
the
first
were
two
gentlemen
in
traveling
costume
preceded
and
followed
by
outriders
in
the
second
was
a
single
traveler
wrapped
in
a
large
cloak
this
carriage
followed
close
behind
the
other
as
far
as
the
barriere
de
where
they
separated
and
while
the
first
stopped
at
the
palais
royal
the
other
drew
up
at
the
rue
de
valois
chapter
x
in
which
dubois
proves
that
his
police
was
better
organized
at
an
expense
of
francs
than
the
general
police
for
three
millions
whatever
might
have
been
the
fatigues
of
the
preceding
night
the
duc
still
gave
his
mornings
to
business
he
generally
began
to
work
with
dubois
before
he
was
dressed
then
came
a
short
and
select
levée
followed
again
by
audiences
which
kept
him
till
eleven
or
twelve
then
the
chiefs
of
the
councils
la
valliere
and
le
blanc
came
to
give
an
account
of
their
espionage
then
torcy
to
bring
any
important
letters
which
he
had
abstracted
at
two
the
regent
had
his
chocolate
which
he
always
took
while
laughing
and
chatting
this
lasted
half
an
hour
then
came
the
audience
hour
for
ladies
after
that
he
went
to
the
duchesse
then
to
the
young
king
whom
he
visited
every
day
and
to
whom
he
always
displayed
the
greatest
reverence
and
respect
once
a
week
he
received
foreign
ministers
and
on
sundays
heard
mass
in
his
private
chapel
at
six
on
council
days
at
five
on
others
all
business
was
over
then
the
regent
would
go
to
the
opera
or
to
madame
de
berry
with
whom
however
he
had
quarreled
now
on
account
of
her
marriage
with
riom
then
came
those
famous
suppers
they
were
composed
of
from
ten
to
fifteen
persons
and
the
presence
among
them
sometimes
added
to
their
license
and
freedom
but
never
restrained
it
at
these
suppers
kings
ministers
chancellors
ladies
of
the
court
were
all
passed
in
review
discussed
abused
everything
might
be
said
everything
told
everything
done
provided
only
that
it
were
wittily
said
told
or
done
when
all
the
guests
had
arrived
the
doors
were
closed
and
barred
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
reach
the
regent
until
the
following
morning
however
urgent
might
be
the
necessity
dubois
was
seldom
of
the
number
his
bad
health
forbade
it
and
this
was
the
time
chosen
to
pick
him
to
pieces
at
which
the
regent
would
laugh
as
heartily
as
any
one
dubois
knew
that
he
often
furnished
the
amusement
of
these
suppers
but
he
also
knew
that
by
the
morning
the
regent
invariably
forgot
what
had
been
said
the
night
before
and
so
he
cared
little
about
it
dubois
however
watched
while
the
regent
supped
or
slept
and
seemed
indefatigable
he
appeared
to
have
the
gift
of
ubiquity
when
he
returned
from
rambouillet
he
called
maitre
tapin
who
had
returned
on
horseback
and
talked
with
him
for
an
hour
after
which
he
slept
for
four
or
five
then
rising
he
presented
himself
at
the
door
of
his
royal
highness
the
regent
was
still
asleep
dubois
approached
the
bed
and
contemplated
him
with
a
smile
which
at
once
resembled
that
of
an
ape
and
a
demon
at
length
he
decided
to
wake
him
hola
monseigneur
wake
up
he
cried
the
duke
opened
his
eyes
and
seeing
dubois
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
saying
ah
is
that
you
abbe
go
to
the
devil
monseigneur
i
have
just
been
there
but
he
was
too
busy
to
receive
me
and
sent
me
to
you
leave
me
alone
i
am
tired
i
dare
say
the
night
was
stormy
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
duke
turning
half
round
i
mean
that
the
way
you
spent
the
night
does
not
suit
a
man
who
makes
appointments
for
seven
in
the
morning
did
i
appoint
you
for
seven
in
the
morning
yes
yesterday
morning
before
you
went
to
st
germains
it
is
true
said
the
regent
monseigneur
did
not
know
that
the
night
would
be
so
fatiguing
fatiguing
i
left
table
at
seven
and
afterward
well
what
afterward
are
you
satisfied
monseigneur
and
was
the
young
person
worth
the
journey
what
journey
the
journey
you
took
after
you
left
the
table
at
seven
one
would
think
to
hear
you
that
from
germains
here
was
a
long
distance
no
monseigneur
is
right
it
is
but
a
few
steps
but
there
is
a
method
of
prolonging
the
distance
what
is
that
going
round
by
rambouillet
you
are
dreaming
abbe
possibly
monseigneur
i
will
tell
you
my
dream
it
will
at
least
prove
to
your
highness
that
even
in
my
dreams
i
do
not
forget
you
some
new
nonsense
not
at
all
i
dreamed
that
monseigneur
started
the
stag
at
le
treillage
and
that
the
animal
after
some
battling
worthy
of
a
stag
of
high
birth
was
taken
at
chambourcy
so
far
your
dream
resembles
the
truth
continue
abbe
after
which
monseigneur
returned
to
germains
sat
down
to
table
at
five
and
ordered
that
the
carriage
without
arms
should
be
prepared
and
harnessed
with
four
horses
at
seven
not
bad
abbe
not
bad
go
on
at
seven
monseigneur
dismissed
every
one
except
lafare
with
whom
he
entered
the
carriage
am
i
right
go
on
go
on
the
carriage
went
toward
rambouillet
and
arrived
there
at
a
quarter
to
ten
but
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
it
stopped
lafare
went
on
in
the
carriage
to
the
monseigneur
following
as
an
outrider
here
your
dream
becomes
confused
abbe
no
no
not
at
all
continue
then
well
while
lafare
pretended
to
eat
a
bad
supper
which
was
served
by
waiters
who
called
him
excellency
monseigneur
gave
his
horse
to
a
page
and
went
to
a
little
pavilion
demon
where
were
you
hidden
i
monseigneur
have
not
left
the
palais
royal
where
i
slept
like
a
dormouse
and
the
proof
is
that
i
am
telling
you
my
dream
and
what
was
there
in
the
pavilion
first
at
the
door
a
horrible
duenna
tall
thin
dry
and
yellow
dubois
i
will
recommend
you
to
desroches
and
the
first
time
she
sees
you
she
will
tear
your
eyes
out
then
inside
mon
dieu
inside
you
could
not
see
that
even
in
a
dream
abbe
monseigneur
you
may
take
away
the
francs
which
you
allow
me
for
my
secret
police
if
by
their
aid
i
did
not
see
into
the
interior
well
what
did
you
see
ma
foi
monseigneur
a
charming
little
bretonne
sixteen
or
seventeen
years
old
beautiful
coming
direct
from
the
augustine
convent
at
clisson
accompanied
to
rambouillet
by
one
of
the
sisters
whose
troublesome
presence
was
soon
dispensed
with
was
it
not
dubois
i
have
often
thought
you
were
the
devil
who
has
taken
the
form
of
an
abbe
to
ruin
me
to
save
you
monseigneur
to
save
you
to
save
me
i
do
not
believe
it
well
said
dubois
are
you
pleased
with
her
enchanted
dubois
she
is
charming
well
you
have
brought
her
from
so
far
that
if
she
were
not
you
would
be
quite
cheated
the
regent
frowned
but
reflecting
that
probably
dubois
did
not
know
the
rest
the
frown
changed
to
a
smile
dubois
said
he
certainly
you
are
a
great
man
ah
monseigneur
no
one
but
you
doubts
it
and
yet
you
disgrace
me
disgrace
you
yes
you
hide
your
loves
from
me
come
do
not
be
vexed
dubois
there
is
reason
however
you
must
confess
monseigneur
why
why
did
you
not
tell
me
you
wanted
a
bretonne
could
not
i
have
sent
for
one
yes
yes
of
course
i
could
as
good
yes
and
better
you
think
you
have
found
a
treasure
perhaps
hola
hola
well
when
you
know
what
she
is
and
to
what
you
expose
yourself
do
not
jest
abbe
i
beg
ah
monseigneur
you
distress
me
what
do
you
mean
that
you
are
taken
by
a
glance
a
single
night
fascinates
you
and
there
is
no
one
to
compare
to
the
new
comer
is
she
then
very
pretty
charming
and
discreet
virtue
itself
i
suppose
you
are
right
well
i
tell
you
monseigneur
you
are
lost
i
yes
your
bretonne
is
a
jade
silence
abbe
why
silence
i
forbid
you
to
say
another
word
monseigneur
you
too
have
had
a
dream
let
me
explain
it
monsieur
joseph
i
will
send
you
to
the
bastille
as
you
please
monseigneur
but
still
you
must
know
that
this
girl
is
my
daughter
abbe
dubois
drew
back
stupefied
your
daughter
and
who
is
her
mother
an
honest
woman
who
had
the
honor
of
dying
without
knowing
you
and
the
child
the
child
has
been
concealed
that
she
might
not
be
sullied
by
the
looks
of
such
creatures
as
you
dubois
bowed
and
retired
respectfully
the
regent
looked
triumphant
ah
said
dubois
who
had
not
quite
closed
the
door
i
thought
this
plot
would
bring
me
my
archbishop
miter
if
i
am
careful
it
will
bring
me
my
cardinal
hat
chapter
xi
rambouillet
again
at
the
appointed
hour
gaston
presented
himself
at
helene
domicile
but
madame
desroches
made
some
difficulty
about
admitting
him
helene
however
said
firmly
that
she
was
quite
at
liberty
to
judge
for
herself
what
was
right
and
that
she
was
quite
determined
to
see
de
livry
who
had
come
to
take
leave
of
her
it
will
be
remembered
that
this
was
the
name
which
gaston
had
assumed
during
the
journey
and
which
he
intended
to
retain
except
when
with
those
connected
with
his
mission
to
paris
madame
desroches
went
to
her
room
somewhat
out
of
humor
and
even
attempted
to
overhear
the
conversation
but
helene
bolted
the
outer
door
ah
gaston
said
she
i
have
been
expecting
you
i
did
not
sleep
last
night
nor
i
helene
but
i
must
admire
all
this
splendor
helene
smiled
and
your
how
beautiful
you
are
like
this
you
do
not
appear
much
pleased
gaston
made
no
reply
but
continued
his
investigations
these
rich
hangings
these
costly
pictures
all
prove
that
your
protectors
are
opulent
helene
i
believe
so
said
helene
smiling
yet
i
am
told
that
these
hangings
and
this
gilding
which
you
admire
are
old
and
unfashionable
and
must
be
replaced
by
new
ah
helene
you
will
become
a
great
lady
said
gaston
sighing
already
i
am
kept
waiting
for
an
audience
my
dear
gaston
did
you
not
wait
for
hours
in
your
little
boat
on
the
lake
you
were
then
in
the
convent
i
waited
the
abbess
pleasure
that
title
is
sacred
is
it
not
yes
it
gives
security
imposes
respect
and
obedience
doubtless
well
judge
of
my
delight
here
i
find
the
same
protection
the
same
love
only
more
powerful
more
lasting
what
exclaimed
gaston
surprised
i
find
speak
in
heaven
name
gaston
i
have
found
a
father
a
father
ah
my
dear
helene
i
share
your
joy
what
happiness
a
father
to
watch
over
my
helene
my
wife
to
watch
from
afar
is
he
separated
from
you
alas
it
seems
the
world
separates
us
is
it
a
secret
a
secret
even
to
me
or
you
may
be
sure
you
should
know
all
i
have
no
secrets
from
you
gaston
a
misfortune
of
birth
a
prescription
in
your
family
some
temporary
obstacle
i
do
not
know
decidedly
it
is
a
secret
but
said
he
smiling
i
permit
you
to
be
discreet
with
me
if
your
father
ordered
it
however
may
i
ask
some
more
questions
oh
yes
are
you
pleased
is
your
father
one
you
can
be
proud
of
i
think
so
his
heart
seems
noble
and
good
his
voice
is
sweet
and
melodious
his
voice
but
is
he
like
you
i
do
not
know
i
have
not
seen
him
not
seen
him
no
it
was
dark
your
father
did
not
wish
to
see
his
daughter
and
you
so
beautiful
oh
what
indifference
no
gaston
he
is
not
indifferent
he
knows
me
well
he
has
my
portrait
that
portrait
which
made
you
so
jealous
last
spring
but
i
do
not
understand
this
it
was
dark
i
tell
you
in
that
case
one
might
light
these
girandoles
said
gaston
that
is
well
when
one
wishes
to
be
seen
but
when
one
has
reasons
for
concealment
what
interrupted
gaston
what
reason
can
a
father
have
for
hiding
from
his
own
daughter
excellent
reasons
i
believe
and
you
should
understand
them
better
than
i
can
oh
helene
said
gaston
with
what
terrible
ideas
you
fill
my
mind
you
alarm
me
gaston
tell
me
what
did
your
father
speak
of
of
his
deep
love
for
me
gaston
started
he
swore
to
me
that
in
future
i
should
be
happy
that
there
should
be
no
more
uncertainty
as
to
my
fate
for
that
he
would
despise
all
those
considerations
which
had
induced
him
as
yet
to
disown
me
as
a
daughter
words
words
but
what
proof
did
he
give
you
pardon
me
these
questions
helene
i
dread
misfortune
i
wish
that
for
a
time
your
angel
innocence
could
give
place
to
the
sharpness
and
infernal
sagacity
of
a
fiend
you
would
then
understand
me
i
should
not
need
to
subject
you
to
this
interrogatory
which
now
is
so
necessary
i
do
not
understand
your
question
gaston
i
do
not
know
how
to
reply
to
you
did
he
show
you
much
affection
yes
but
in
the
darkness
when
he
wished
to
speak
to
you
he
took
my
hand
and
his
trembled
the
most
gaston
clenched
his
hands
with
rage
he
embraced
you
paternally
did
he
not
he
gave
me
a
single
kiss
on
the
forehead
which
i
received
on
my
knees
helene
he
cried
my
fears
were
not
groundless
you
are
betrayed
you
are
the
victim
of
a
snare
helene
this
man
who
conceals
himself
who
fears
the
light
who
calls
you
his
child
is
not
your
father
gaston
you
distress
me
helene
angels
might
envy
your
innocence
but
on
earth
all
is
abused
even
angels
are
insulted
profaned
by
men
this
man
whom
i
will
know
whom
i
will
seize
and
force
to
have
confidence
in
your
love
and
honor
shall
tell
me
if
he
be
not
the
vilest
of
beings
whether
i
am
to
call
him
father
or
kill
him
as
a
wretch
gaston
your
brain
is
wandering
what
can
lead
you
to
suspect
such
treachery
and
since
you
arouse
my
suspicions
since
you
hold
a
light
over
those
ignoble
labyrinths
of
the
human
heart
which
i
refused
to
contemplate
i
will
speak
to
you
with
the
same
freedom
was
i
not
in
this
man
power
is
not
this
house
his
are
not
the
people
by
whom
i
am
surrounded
devoted
to
his
orders
gaston
if
you
love
me
you
will
ask
my
pardon
for
what
you
have
thought
and
said
of
my
father
gaston
was
in
despair
do
not
destroy
one
of
the
purest
and
holiest
joys
i
have
ever
tasted
do
not
poison
the
happiness
of
a
life
which
i
have
often
wept
to
think
was
solitary
and
abandoned
without
other
affection
than
that
of
which
heaven
forbids
us
to
be
lavish
let
my
filial
ties
compensate
for
the
remorse
which
i
sometimes
feel
for
loving
you
almost
to
idolatry
helene
forgive
me
cried
gaston
yes
you
are
right
i
sully
your
pure
joys
by
my
contact
and
it
may
be
the
noble
affection
of
your
father
but
in
heaven
name
helene
give
some
heed
to
the
fears
of
my
experience
and
my
love
criminal
passions
often
speculate
on
innocent
credulity
the
argument
you
use
is
weak
to
show
at
once
a
guilty
love
would
be
unlike
a
skillful
corrupter
but
to
win
you
by
a
novel
luxury
pleasing
to
your
age
to
accustom
you
gradually
to
new
impressions
to
win
you
at
last
by
persuasion
is
a
sweeter
victory
than
that
of
violence
helene
listen
to
my
prudence
of
years
i
say
my
prudence
for
it
is
my
love
that
speaks
that
love
which
you
should
see
so
humble
so
devoted
so
ready
to
accept
a
father
whom
i
knew
to
be
really
your
parent
helene
made
no
answer
i
implore
you
continued
gaston
not
to
take
any
determination
now
but
to
watch
everything
around
you
suspect
the
perfumes
which
are
given
you
the
wine
which
you
are
offered
everything
helene
watch
over
yourself
you
are
my
happiness
my
honor
my
life
my
friend
i
will
obey
you
this
will
not
keep
me
from
loving
my
father
adore
him
helene
if
i
am
wrong
you
are
a
noble
friend
gaston
we
are
agreed
then
at
the
slightest
suspicion
write
to
me
write
you
leave
me
then
i
must
go
to
paris
on
business
i
shall
be
at
the
hotel
muids
rue
des
bourdonnais
write
down
this
address
and
do
not
show
it
to
any
one
why
so
many
precautions
gaston
hesitated
because
if
your
devoted
protector
were
known
his
plans
for
aiding
you
might
be
frustrated
in
case
of
bad
intentions
you
are
somewhat
mysterious
gaston
i
have
a
father
who
conceals
himself
and
a
lover
this
word
i
can
hardly
speak
who
is
going
to
do
the
same
but
my
intentions
you
know
said
gaston
attempting
to
force
a
laugh
ah
madame
desroches
is
coming
back
she
thinks
our
interview
too
long
i
am
as
much
under
tutelage
as
at
the
convent
gaston
imprinted
a
kiss
on
the
hand
helene
held
out
to
him
as
madame
desroches
approached
helene
made
a
formal
curtsey
which
gaston
returned
by
an
equally
formal
bow
gaston
left
for
paris
owen
awaited
him
with
impatience
and
this
time
could
not
reproach
his
master
with
being
slow
for
in
three
hours
they
were
in
paris
chapter
xii
captain
la
jonquiere
there
was
as
the
reader
has
learned
in
the
rue
des
bourdonnais
a
hotel
where
one
could
lodge
eat
and
drink
in
his
nocturnal
interview
with
dubois
tapin
had
received
the
famous
name
of
la
jonquiere
and
had
transmitted
it
to
who
had
passed
it
to
all
the
chiefs
of
police
who
had
begun
to
search
for
the
suspected
officer
in
all
the
equivocal
houses
in
paris
the
conspiracy
of
cellamare
which
we
have
related
in
a
history
of
the
chevalier
had
taught
them
that
everywhere
conspirators
were
to
be
found
it
was
however
by
luck
or
by
cleverness
maitre
tapin
himself
who
in
the
rue
des
bourdonnais
and
in
the
hotel
muids
found
la
jonquiere
who
was
then
a
nightmare
to
dubois
the
landlord
took
tapin
to
be
an
old
attorney
clerk
and
replied
to
his
questions
politely
that
the
captain
la
jonquiere
was
in
the
hotel
but
was
asleep
tapin
asked
no
more
la
jonquiere
was
asleep
therefore
he
was
in
bed
for
it
was
only
six
in
the
morning
if
he
were
in
bed
then
he
must
be
stopping
at
the
inn
tapin
went
back
to
the
palais
royal
and
found
dubois
who
had
just
left
the
regent
a
number
of
false
la
jonquieres
had
already
been
discovered
by
his
emissaries
one
was
a
smuggler
called
captain
la
jonciere
whom
had
found
and
arrested
a
second
was
la
jonquille
sergeant
in
the
french
guards
and
many
others
well
said
dubois
when
tapin
had
made
his
report
you
have
found
the
real
captain
la
jonquiere
then
yes
monseigneur
is
he
called
la
jonquiere
yes
monseigneur
la
jon
quiere
continued
he
spelling
the
word
la
jonquiere
repeated
tapin
a
captain
yes
monseigneur
what
is
he
doing
waiting
and
drinking
that
must
be
he
said
dubois
and
does
he
pay
he
evidently
attached
great
importance
to
the
question
very
well
monsieur
a
la
bonne
heure
tapin
you
have
some
sense
monseigneur
said
tapin
modestly
you
flatter
me
it
is
quite
clear
if
he
had
not
paid
he
could
not
have
been
a
dangerous
man
dubois
gave
him
ten
louis
as
a
reward
gave
him
some
further
orders
and
set
out
at
once
to
go
to
the
rue
des
bourdonnais
let
us
say
a
word
regarding
the
interior
of
the
hotel
it
was
partly
hotel
partly
public
house
the
dwelling
rooms
were
on
the
and
the
tavern
rooms
on
the
the
principal
of
these
the
common
room
had
four
oak
tables
and
a
quantity
of
red
and
white
curtains
some
benches
along
the
walls
some
glasses
on
a
sideboard
some
handsomely
framed
pictures
all
blackened
and
rendered
nauseous
by
smoke
completed
the
tout
ensemble
of
this
room
in
which
sat
a
fat
man
with
a
red
face
or
forty
years
old
and
a
little
pale
girl
of
twelve
or
fourteen
this
was
the
landlord
and
his
only
daughter
and
heiress
a
servant
was
cooking
a
ragout
in
the
kitchen
as
the
clock
struck
one
a
french
guard
entered
and
stopping
at
the
threshold
murmured
rue
des
bourdonnais
muids
in
the
common
room
to
sit
at
the
table
on
the
left
and
wait
then
in
accordance
with
this
the
worthy
defender
of
his
country
whistling
a
tune
and
twirling
his
mustache
seated
himself
at
the
place
indicated
scarcely
had
he
had
time
to
seat
himself
and
strike
his
fist
on
the
table
which
in
the
language
of
all
taverns
means
some
wine
than
a
second
guard
dressed
exactly
like
the
first
appeared
at
the
door
murmured
some
words
and
after
a
little
hesitation
seated
himself
by
the
other
the
two
soldiers
looked
at
each
other
and
both
exclaimed
ah
which
in
all
languages
means
surprise
it
is
you
grippart
said
one
it
is
you
said
the
other
what
are
you
doing
in
this
tavern
and
you
i
do
not
know
nor
i
you
come
here
then
illustration
captain
la
page
under
orders
that
is
my
case
and
you
are
waiting
for
a
man
who
is
coming
with
a
watchword
and
on
this
watchword
i
am
to
obey
as
though
it
were
tapin
himself
just
so
and
in
the
mean
time
i
have
a
pistole
for
drink
i
have
a
pistole
also
but
i
was
not
told
to
drink
and
it
being
doubtful
in
doubt
as
the
sage
says
i
do
not
abstain
in
that
case
let
us
drink
and
he
raised
his
hand
to
call
the
landlord
but
it
was
not
necessary
for
he
was
standing
near
expecting
orders
some
wine
cried
the
two
guards
orleans
added
one
i
like
that
the
landlord
brought
an
inclosed
bottle
the
two
drinkers
filled
their
glasses
emptied
them
and
then
placed
them
on
the
table
each
with
a
different
grimace
but
both
intended
to
express
the
same
opinion
when
the
host
was
gone
one
said
to
the
other
you
know
more
of
this
than
you
have
told
me
i
know
it
concerns
a
certain
captain
answered
the
other
yes
just
so
but
i
suppose
we
shall
have
aid
to
arrest
him
doubtless
two
to
one
is
not
enough
you
forget
the
man
with
the
watchword
ah
i
think
i
hear
something
yes
some
one
coming
downstairs
chut
silence
and
the
soldiers
much
more
occupied
by
their
commission
than
if
they
had
really
been
soldiers
kept
an
eye
turned
toward
the
staircase
while
they
drunk
they
were
not
deceived
the
step
on
the
staircase
approached
and
they
saw
first
some
legs
then
a
body
then
a
head
descending
the
legs
were
covered
with
fine
silk
stockings
and
white
cashmere
breeches
the
body
with
a
tight
blue
coat
and
the
head
with
a
hat
jauntily
placed
over
one
ear
his
epaulets
left
no
doubt
that
he
held
the
rank
of
captain
this
man
who
was
in
fact
captain
la
jonquiere
was
about
five
feet
five
rather
fat
and
had
a
sagacious
air
one
would
almost
have
supposed
that
he
suspected
spies
in
the
two
soldiers
for
he
turned
his
back
to
them
at
once
and
entered
into
conversation
with
his
host
in
a
somewhat
assumed
tone
and
manner
in
truth
said
he
i
should
have
dined
here
and
this
delicious
perfume
of
stewed
kidneys
would
have
tempted
me
but
some
bons
vivants
are
expecting
me
at
the
de
paphos
perhaps
a
young
man
may
come
here
this
morning
but
i
could
not
wait
any
longer
should
he
ask
for
a
hundred
pistoles
say
that
i
shall
be
back
in
an
hour
if
he
will
wait
very
well
captain
said
the
host
some
wine
said
the
guard
ah
said
the
captain
throwing
an
apparently
careless
glance
at
the
drinkers
here
are
some
soldiers
who
have
but
little
respect
for
an
epaulet
then
turning
to
the
host
serve
these
gentlemen
you
see
they
are
in
a
hurry
ah
said
one
rising
as
soon
as
monsieur
will
permit
certainly
i
permit
it
said
la
jonquiere
and
he
stepped
toward
the
door
but
captain
said
the
host
stopping
him
you
have
not
told
me
the
name
of
the
gentleman
you
expect
la
jonquiere
hesitated
after
a
moment
monsieur
gaston
de
chanlay
he
replied
gaston
de
chanlay
repeated
the
host
i
hope
i
shall
remember
the
name
gaston
gascon
ah
i
shall
remember
gascon
chanlay
ah
i
shall
think
of
chandelle
that
is
it
repeated
la
jonquiere
gravely
gascon
de
chandelle
and
he
went
out
but
not
without
looking
round
the
corners
of
the
street
and
the
angles
of
the
houses
he
had
not
taken
a
hundred
steps
in
the
rue
honoré
before
dubois
presented
himself
at
the
door
he
had
passed
la
jonquiere
but
never
having
seen
him
could
not
recognize
him
he
presented
himself
boldly
dressed
as
a
shopkeeper
chapter
xiii
monsieur
moutonnet
draper
at
dubois
at
once
accosted
the
host
monsieur
said
he
timidly
does
captain
la
jonquiere
lodge
here
i
wish
to
speak
to
him
you
wish
to
speak
to
him
said
the
host
examining
the
from
head
to
foot
if
possible
said
dubois
are
you
sure
that
is
the
person
you
want
asked
the
host
who
did
not
think
this
was
the
man
la
jonquiere
expected
i
think
so
said
dubois
modestly
a
short
fat
man
yes
drinks
his
brandy
neat
that
is
the
man
always
ready
with
his
cane
if
he
is
not
attended
to
directly
ah
that
is
captain
la
jonquiere
you
know
him
then
not
in
the
least
said
dubois
true
for
you
must
have
met
him
at
the
door
diable
is
he
out
said
dubois
with
a
start
of
badly
repressed
thank
you
and
he
called
up
an
amiable
smile
he
has
not
been
gone
five
minutes
but
he
is
coming
back
in
an
hour
may
i
wait
for
him
monsieur
certainly
if
you
take
something
give
me
some
said
dubois
i
never
drink
wine
except
with
meals
the
two
guards
exchanged
a
contemptuous
smile
the
host
hastened
to
bring
the
cherries
ah
said
dubois
only
five
at
they
give
six
possibly
monsieur
for
at
they
have
no
excise
to
pay
yes
i
forgot
that
and
he
began
to
eat
a
cherry
which
he
could
not
however
accomplish
without
a
grimace
where
does
the
captain
lodge
asked
dubois
there
is
the
door
of
his
room
he
preferred
the
yes
murmured
dubois
the
windows
look
into
the
public
road
and
there
is
a
door
opening
into
the
rue
des
oh
how
convenient
and
does
not
the
noise
annoy
him
there
is
another
room
above
sometimes
he
sleeps
in
one
sometimes
in
the
other
like
denis
the
tyrant
said
dubois
who
could
not
refrain
from
latin
or
historical
quotations
what
said
mine
host
dubois
bit
his
lip
at
this
moment
one
of
the
soldiers
called
for
wine
and
the
host
darted
off
to
wait
upon
him
dubois
turned
to
the
two
guards
thank
you
said
he
what
is
it
bourgeois
asked
they
france
and
the
regent
replied
dubois
the
watchword
cried
both
rising
enter
this
room
said
dubois
showing
la
jonquiere
room
open
the
door
into
the
rue
des
and
hide
behind
a
curtain
under
a
table
in
a
closet
wherever
you
can
if
when
i
come
in
i
can
see
so
much
as
an
ear
you
will
have
no
pay
for
six
months
the
two
men
emptied
their
glasses
and
entered
the
room
while
dubois
who
saw
they
had
forgotten
to
pay
put
a
piece
of
twelve
sous
on
the
table
then
opening
the
window
and
calling
to
the
driver
of
a
hackney
carriage
standing
before
the
door
said
he
bring
the
carriage
to
the
little
door
in
the
rue
des
and
tell
tapin
to
come
up
when
i
knock
on
the
windows
with
my
fingers
he
has
his
orders
be
off
the
host
reappeared
hola
cried
where
are
my
men
a
sergeant
came
and
called
them
away
but
they
have
not
paid
yes
they
left
a
piece
on
the
table
diable
twelve
sous
and
my
wine
is
eight
sous
the
bottle
ah
said
dubois
no
doubt
they
thought
that
as
they
were
soldiers
you
would
make
a
reduction
at
any
rate
said
the
host
consoling
himself
it
is
not
all
lost
and
in
our
trade
one
must
expect
this
kind
of
thing
you
have
nothing
of
the
sort
to
fear
with
captain
la
jonquiere
oh
no
he
is
the
best
of
lodgers
he
pays
without
a
word
and
ready
money
true
he
never
likes
anything
oh
that
may
be
his
manner
said
dubois
exactly
what
you
tell
me
of
his
prompt
payment
pleases
me
have
you
come
to
ask
for
money
he
said
he
expected
some
one
to
whom
he
owed
a
hundred
pistoles
no
on
the
contrary
i
owe
him
fifty
louis
fifty
louis
peste
said
the
host
what
a
pretty
sum
perhaps
i
was
mistaken
and
he
said
receive
not
pay
are
you
the
chevalier
gaston
de
chanlay
does
he
expect
the
chevalier
gaston
de
chanlay
said
dubois
with
a
joy
he
could
not
conceal
he
told
me
so
said
the
host
is
that
you
no
i
am
not
noble
i
am
called
moutonnet
nobility
is
nothing
said
the
host
one
may
be
called
moutonnet
and
be
an
honest
man
yes
moutonnet
draper
at
st
and
you
have
fifty
louis
for
the
captain
yes
in
turning
over
some
old
accounts
of
my
father
i
find
he
owed
fifty
louis
to
captain
la
jonquiere
father
and
i
have
had
no
peace
till
instead
of
the
father
who
is
dead
i
had
found
the
son
do
you
know
there
are
not
many
debtors
like
you
the
moutonnets
are
all
the
same
from
father
to
son
when
we
are
owed
anything
we
are
pitiless
listen
there
is
an
honest
fellow
who
owed
moutonnet
son
one
hundred
and
sixty
francs
my
grandfather
put
him
in
prison
and
there
he
has
been
for
the
three
generations
and
he
has
just
died
there
i
calculated
that
during
the
thirty
years
he
was
there
he
cost
us
twelve
thousand
francs
but
we
maintained
the
principle
but
i
beg
your
pardon
for
keeping
you
with
all
this
nonsense
and
here
is
a
new
customer
for
you
ah
said
the
host
it
is
captain
la
jonquiere
himself
captain
continued
he
some
one
is
waiting
for
you
the
captain
entered
suspiciously
he
had
seen
some
strange
and
he
thought
sinister
faces
about
dubois
saluted
him
politely
la
jonquiere
asked
the
host
if
the
friend
he
had
expected
had
arrived
no
one
but
monsieur
however
you
lose
nothing
by
the
exchange
since
one
was
to
fetch
away
money
and
the
other
brings
it
la
jonquiere
surprised
turned
to
dubois
who
repeated
the
same
story
he
had
told
to
the
host
and
with
such
success
that
la
jonquiere
calling
for
wine
asked
dubois
to
follow
him
into
his
room
dubois
approached
the
window
and
quietly
tapped
on
it
with
his
fingers
but
shall
i
not
be
in
the
way
in
your
room
asked
dubois
not
at
all
not
at
all
the
view
is
pleasant
as
we
drink
we
can
look
out
and
see
the
and
there
are
some
pretty
women
in
the
rue
des
bourdonnais
they
entered
the
room
dubois
made
a
sign
to
tapin
who
appeared
in
the
first
room
followed
by
two
men
then
shut
the
door
behind
him
tapin
two
followers
went
to
the
window
of
the
common
room
and
drew
the
curtains
while
tapin
placed
himself
behind
the
door
of
room
so
as
to
be
hidden
by
it
when
it
opened
the
host
now
returned
from
la
jonquiere
room
to
write
down
the
receipt
for
the
money
which
la
jonquiere
had
just
paid
him
for
the
wine
when
tapin
threw
a
handkerchief
over
his
mouth
and
carried
him
off
like
a
feather
to
a
second
carriage
standing
at
the
door
one
of
the
men
seized
the
little
girl
who
was
cooking
eggs
the
other
carried
off
the
servant
and
soon
they
were
all
on
the
way
to
lazare
drawn
by
two
such
good
horses
that
it
was
evidently
not
a
real
hired
car
tapin
remained
behind
and
taking
from
a
closet
a
calico
apron
and
waistcoat
signed
to
a
loiterer
who
was
looking
in
at
the
window
and
who
quickly
transformed
himself
into
a
publican
at
this
moment
a
violent
noise
was
heard
in
the
captain
room
as
of
a
table
thrown
down
with
bottles
and
glasses
then
oaths
then
the
clinking
of
a
sword
then
silence
presently
a
carriage
was
heard
rolling
away
up
the
rue
de
tapin
looked
joyous
bravo
said
he
that
is
done
it
was
time
masters
said
the
pretended
publican
for
here
is
a
customer
chapter
xiv
trust
to
signs
of
gratitude
tapin
at
first
thought
that
it
was
the
chevalier
de
chanlay
but
it
was
only
a
woman
who
wanted
a
pint
of
wine
what
has
happened
to
poor
m
bourguignon
asked
she
he
has
just
been
taken
away
in
a
coach
alas
said
tapin
we
were
far
from
expecting
it
he
was
standing
there
talking
and
was
suddenly
seized
with
apoplexy
gracious
heavens
we
are
all
mortal
said
tapin
throwing
up
his
eyes
but
why
did
they
take
the
little
girl
to
attend
to
her
father
it
is
her
duty
but
the
servant
to
cook
for
them
ah
i
could
not
understand
it
all
so
i
came
to
buy
a
pint
of
wine
though
i
did
not
want
it
that
i
might
find
out
well
now
you
know
yes
but
who
are
you
i
am
champagne
bourguignon
cousin
i
arrived
by
chance
this
morning
i
brought
him
news
of
his
family
and
the
sudden
joy
overcame
him
ask
grabigeon
continued
tapin
showing
his
assistant
who
was
finishing
an
omelet
commenced
by
the
landlord
daughter
oh
yes
everything
passed
exactly
as
champagne
says
replied
grabigeon
wiping
away
a
tear
with
the
handle
of
his
spoon
poor
bourguignon
then
you
think
that
we
should
pray
for
him
there
is
never
any
harm
in
praying
said
tapin
sententiously
ah
stop
a
minute
give
me
good
measure
bourguignon
would
have
groaned
in
spirit
could
he
have
seen
the
wine
that
tapin
gave
for
her
two
sous
well
said
she
i
will
go
and
tell
the
neighbors
who
are
very
anxious
and
i
promise
you
my
custom
champagne
indeed
if
bourguignon
were
not
your
cousin
i
would
tell
you
what
i
think
oh
tell
me
never
mind
that
i
perceive
that
he
cheated
me
shamefully
what
you
have
given
me
for
two
sous
he
would
hardly
have
given
me
for
four
but
if
there
is
no
justice
here
there
is
in
heaven
and
it
is
very
providential
that
you
are
to
continue
his
business
i
believe
so
said
tapin
in
a
half
voice
particularly
for
his
customers
and
he
dismissed
the
woman
just
as
the
door
opened
and
a
young
man
entered
dressed
in
a
blue
cloak
is
this
the
hotel
le
muids
asked
he
yes
monsieur
does
captain
la
jonquiere
lodge
here
yes
monsieur
is
he
within
yes
he
has
just
returned
tell
him
if
you
please
that
the
chevalier
gaston
de
chanlay
is
here
tapin
offered
the
chevalier
a
chair
and
went
into
la
jonquiere
room
gaston
shook
the
snow
from
his
boots
and
cloak
and
proceeded
leisurely
to
examine
the
picture
on
the
wall
never
supposing
that
he
had
close
to
him
three
or
four
swords
which
at
a
sign
from
the
polite
host
would
leave
their
sheaths
to
be
plunged
into
his
breast
tapin
returned
saying
captain
la
jonquiere
waits
for
de
chanlay
gaston
proceeded
to
the
room
where
sat
a
man
whom
the
host
pointed
out
as
captain
la
jouquiere
and
without
being
much
of
a
physiognomist
he
perceived
at
once
that
he
was
no
bully
little
dry
uneasy
in
his
uniform
such
appeared
the
formidable
captain
whom
gaston
had
been
recommended
to
treat
with
so
much
consideration
this
man
is
ugly
and
looks
like
a
sexton
thought
gaston
then
as
the
stranger
advanced
toward
him
have
i
the
honor
of
speaking
to
captain
la
jonquiere
asked
gaston
himself
said
dubois
and
are
you
le
chevalier
gaston
de
chanlay
i
am
monsieur
have
you
the
sign
of
recognition
asked
the
false
la
jonquiere
here
is
the
half
of
the
gold
piece
and
here
the
other
said
dubois
they
tried
the
two
which
fitted
exactly
and
now
continued
gaston
the
papers
and
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
strangely
folded
paper
on
which
was
written
the
name
of
la
jonquiere
dubois
took
from
his
pocket
a
similar
paper
bearing
gaston
name
they
were
precisely
alike
now
said
gaston
the
they
found
that
their
new
were
precisely
similar
and
both
though
new
contained
an
almanac
for
the
year
nineteen
years
previous
and
now
monsieur
said
gaston
now
we
will
talk
of
business
is
not
that
your
meaning
chevalier
exactly
are
we
safe
as
though
in
a
desert
they
seated
themselves
by
a
table
on
which
were
a
bottle
of
sherry
and
two
glasses
dubois
filled
one
and
was
about
to
fill
the
other
when
gaston
stopped
him
peste
thought
dubois
he
is
slender
and
sober
bad
signs
cæsar
mistrusted
thin
people
who
did
not
drink
and
brutus
and
cassius
were
such
captain
said
gaston
after
a
short
silence
when
we
undertake
as
now
an
affair
in
which
we
risk
our
heads
i
think
we
should
know
each
other
so
that
the
past
may
vouch
for
the
future
montlouis
talhouet
de
couëdic
and
pontcalec
have
told
you
my
name
and
condition
i
was
brought
up
by
a
brother
who
had
reasons
for
personal
hatred
to
the
regent
this
hatred
i
have
imbibed
therefore
three
years
ago
when
the
league
was
formed
among
the
nobility
in
bretagne
i
entered
the
conspiracy
now
i
have
been
chosen
to
come
to
paris
to
receive
the
instructions
of
baron
de
valef
who
has
arrived
from
spain
to
transmit
them
to
the
duc
his
catholic
majesty
agent
in
paris
and
to
assure
myself
of
his
assent
and
what
is
captain
la
jonquiere
to
do
in
all
this
asked
dubois
as
though
he
were
doubting
the
chevalier
identity
to
present
me
to
the
duc
i
arrived
two
hours
ago
since
then
i
have
seen
de
valef
and
now
i
come
to
you
now
you
know
my
history
dubois
listened
and
when
gaston
had
finished
as
to
me
chevalier
said
he
throwing
himself
back
indolently
in
his
chair
i
must
own
my
history
is
somewhat
longer
and
more
adventurous
however
if
you
wish
to
hear
it
i
obey
i
think
it
necessary
in
our
position
to
know
each
other
said
gaston
well
said
dubois
as
you
know
i
am
called
captain
la
jonquiere
my
father
was
like
myself
a
soldier
of
fortune
this
is
a
trade
at
which
one
gains
in
general
a
good
deal
of
glory
and
very
little
money
my
glorious
father
died
leaving
me
for
sole
inheritance
his
rapier
and
his
uniform
i
girded
on
the
rapier
which
was
rather
too
long
and
i
wore
the
uniform
which
was
rather
too
large
from
that
time
said
dubois
calling
the
chevalier
attention
to
the
looseness
of
his
coat
from
that
time
i
contracted
the
habit
of
always
having
plenty
of
room
to
move
easily
gaston
nodded
as
though
to
express
his
approbation
of
this
habit
thanks
to
my
good
looks
i
was
received
in
the
royal
italian
which
was
then
recruiting
in
france
i
held
a
distinguished
post
when
the
day
before
the
battle
of
malplaquet
i
had
a
slight
quarrel
with
my
sergeant
about
an
order
which
he
gave
me
with
the
end
of
his
cane
raised
instead
of
lowered
as
it
should
have
been
pardon
me
said
gaston
but
i
can
not
see
what
difference
that
could
make
to
the
order
he
was
giving
it
made
this
difference
that
in
lowering
his
cane
it
struck
against
my
hat
which
fell
to
the
ground
the
result
was
a
duel
in
which
i
passed
my
saber
through
his
body
now
as
i
certainly
should
have
been
shot
if
i
had
waited
to
be
arrested
i
made
off
and
woke
the
next
morning
devil
take
me
if
i
know
how
it
happened
in
army
that
is
to
say
you
deserted
said
gaston
smiling
i
had
coriolanus
and
the
great
condé
for
examples
said
dubois
and
this
appeared
to
me
to
be
sufficient
to
excuse
me
in
the
eyes
of
posterity
i
assisted
then
i
must
tell
you
as
we
are
to
hide
nothing
from
one
another
at
the
battle
of
malplaquet
but
instead
of
being
on
one
side
of
the
brook
i
was
on
the
other
and
instead
of
having
the
village
behind
me
i
faced
it
i
think
this
was
a
lucky
exchange
for
your
humble
servant
the
royal
italian
left
eight
hundred
men
on
the
field
of
battle
my
company
was
cut
to
pieces
and
my
own
comrade
and
bedfellow
killed
by
a
the
glory
with
which
my
late
regiment
covered
itself
so
much
delighted
marlborough
that
he
made
me
an
ensign
on
the
field
of
battle
with
such
a
protector
i
ought
to
have
done
well
but
his
wife
lady
marlborough
whom
heaven
confound
having
been
awkward
enough
to
spill
a
bowl
of
water
over
queen
anne
dress
this
great
event
changed
the
face
of
things
in
europe
in
the
overthrow
which
resulted
i
found
myself
without
any
other
protector
than
my
own
merit
and
the
enemies
i
had
gained
thereby
and
what
did
you
do
then
asked
gaston
somewhat
interested
in
the
adventurous
life
of
the
pretended
captain
what
could
i
do
i
was
forced
to
enter
the
service
of
his
catholic
majesty
who
to
his
honor
be
it
said
graciously
acceded
to
my
demand
for
a
commission
in
three
years
i
was
a
captain
but
out
of
our
pay
of
thirty
reals
a
day
they
kept
back
twenty
telling
us
what
an
honor
it
was
for
us
to
lend
money
to
the
king
of
spain
as
the
security
did
not
appear
good
in
my
eyes
i
asked
leave
of
my
colonel
to
quit
the
service
and
return
to
my
beautiful
country
accompanied
by
a
recommendation
in
order
that
the
malplaquet
affair
might
not
be
too
much
brought
on
the
tapis
the
colonel
referred
me
to
the
prince
do
cellamare
who
recognizing
in
me
a
natural
disposition
to
obey
without
discussion
any
orders
given
in
a
proper
manner
and
accompanied
by
a
certain
music
employed
me
actively
in
the
famous
conspiracy
which
bears
his
name
when
all
at
once
the
whole
affair
blew
up
as
you
know
by
the
double
denunciation
of
la
fillon
and
a
wretched
writer
called
buvat
but
his
highness
wisely
thinking
that
what
is
deferred
is
not
lost
recommended
me
to
his
successor
to
whom
i
hope
my
services
may
be
useful
and
whom
i
thank
most
heartily
for
procuring
me
the
acquaintance
of
so
accomplished
a
cavalier
as
yourself
count
on
me
then
chevalier
as
your
most
humble
and
obedient
servant
i
ask
nothing
of
you
captain
replied
gaston
but
to
present
me
to
the
duke
the
only
person
to
whom
my
instructions
permit
me
to
speak
openly
and
to
whom
i
am
to
deliver
the
baron
de
valef
dispatches
i
beg
therefore
that
you
will
present
me
to
his
excellency
this
very
day
chevalier
said
dubois
who
seemed
to
have
decided
on
his
course
of
action
in
an
hour
if
you
like
in
ten
minutes
if
necessary
as
soon
as
possible
listen
said
dubois
i
was
a
little
too
quick
when
i
said
you
should
see
his
excellency
in
an
hour
in
paris
one
is
never
sure
perhaps
he
does
not
know
of
your
coming
and
i
may
not
find
him
at
home
i
understand
perhaps
even
i
may
be
prevented
from
coming
back
to
fetch
you
how
so
peste
chevalier
it
is
easy
to
see
that
this
is
your
first
visit
to
paris
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
in
paris
there
are
three
distinct
bodies
of
police
who
all
unite
to
torment
those
honest
people
who
only
desire
to
substitute
what
is
not
for
what
is
first
the
regent
police
which
is
not
much
to
be
feared
secondly
that
of
messire
voyer
this
has
its
days
when
he
is
in
a
bad
humor
or
has
been
ill
received
at
the
convent
of
the
madeleine
du
tresnel
thirdly
there
is
dubois
police
ah
that
is
a
different
thing
dubois
is
a
a
wretch
cried
gaston
i
am
well
aware
of
that
dubois
smiled
his
sinister
smile
well
to
escape
these
three
police
said
gaston
one
must
be
prudent
chevalier
instruct
me
captain
for
you
seem
to
know
more
about
it
than
i
who
am
a
provincial
first
we
must
not
lodge
in
the
same
hotel
diable
said
gaston
who
remembered
the
address
given
to
helene
i
had
a
great
wish
to
remain
here
i
will
be
the
one
to
turn
out
then
chevalier
take
one
of
my
rooms
this
one
or
the
one
above
i
prefer
this
you
are
right
on
the
a
window
looking
into
one
street
a
secret
door
to
the
other
you
have
a
quick
eye
we
shall
make
something
of
you
let
us
return
to
our
business
right
where
was
i
you
said
you
might
not
be
able
to
come
back
and
fetch
me
yes
but
in
that
case
take
care
not
to
follow
any
one
without
sufficient
signs
by
what
signs
shall
i
recognize
any
one
as
coming
from
you
first
he
must
have
a
letter
from
me
i
do
not
know
your
writing
true
i
will
give
you
a
specimen
and
dubois
wrote
the
following
lines
monsieur
le
chevaliér
follow
without
fear
the
man
who
brings
this
note
he
is
deputed
by
me
to
lead
you
to
the
house
where
the
duc
and
captain
la
jonquiere
await
you
stay
said
he
giving
him
the
note
if
any
one
comes
in
my
name
he
will
give
you
a
similar
letter
is
that
enough
one
can
not
be
too
careful
besides
the
letter
he
will
show
you
the
and
at
the
door
of
the
house
to
which
he
leads
you
ask
for
the
third
sign
which
will
be
the
paper
it
is
well
said
gaston
with
these
precautions
the
devil
is
in
it
if
we
are
mistaken
now
what
am
i
to
do
wait
you
will
not
go
out
no
well
remain
quiet
in
this
hotel
where
you
will
want
for
nothing
i
will
recommend
you
to
the
host
thanks
my
dear
champagne
said
dubois
to
tapin
opening
the
door
the
chevalier
de
chanlay
takes
my
room
attend
to
him
as
you
would
to
me
then
closing
it
that
fellow
is
worth
his
weight
in
gold
tapin
said
he
in
a
low
voice
do
not
lose
sight
of
him
for
a
moment
you
will
answer
for
him
with
your
head
chapter
xv
his
excellency
the
duc
dubois
on
leaving
the
chevalier
contemplated
the
chance
which
had
again
placed
in
his
hands
the
future
of
the
regent
and
of
france
in
crossing
the
hall
he
recognized
and
signed
to
him
to
follow
it
was
who
had
undertaken
to
get
the
real
la
jonquiere
out
of
the
way
dubois
became
thoughtful
the
easiest
part
of
the
affair
was
done
it
now
remained
to
persuade
the
regent
to
put
himself
in
a
kind
of
affair
which
he
held
in
the
utmost
horror
the
maneuvering
of
intrigue
dubois
began
by
asking
where
the
regent
was
and
how
occupied
the
prince
was
in
his
studio
finishing
an
etching
commenced
by
hubert
the
chemist
who
at
an
adjoining
table
was
occupied
in
embalming
an
ibis
by
the
egyptian
method
which
he
professed
to
have
recovered
a
secretary
was
reading
some
letters
to
the
regent
all
at
once
to
the
regent
astonishment
for
this
was
his
sanctum
the
door
opened
and
an
usher
announced
captain
la
jonquiere
the
regent
turned
la
jonquiere
said
he
who
is
this
hubert
looked
surprised
that
a
stranger
should
be
thus
unceremoniously
intruded
on
their
privacy
at
this
moment
a
head
appeared
at
the
open
door
the
regent
did
not
at
first
recognize
dubois
in
his
disguise
but
shortly
the
pointed
nose
which
had
not
its
match
in
the
kingdom
betrayed
him
a
merry
look
took
the
place
of
the
astonishment
which
the
features
had
at
first
displayed
ah
it
is
you
abbe
said
his
highness
laughing
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
disguise
it
means
that
i
have
changed
my
skin
and
from
a
fox
have
turned
into
a
lion
and
now
monsieur
the
chemist
and
monsieur
the
secretary
do
me
the
favor
to
take
your
bird
and
letters
elsewhere
why
so
asked
the
regent
because
i
have
important
business
to
speak
of
with
you
go
to
the
devil
with
your
important
business
it
is
too
late
come
monseigneur
said
dubois
do
not
force
me
to
remain
till
in
this
villainous
disguise
do
what
you
please
but
i
have
decided
that
the
rest
of
this
day
shall
be
given
to
pleasure
well
i
come
to
propose
a
disguise
to
you
also
a
disguise
what
do
you
mean
dubois
asked
the
regent
who
thought
it
was
probably
one
of
his
ordinary
masquerades
ah
it
makes
your
mouth
water
monsieur
alain
speak
what
do
you
want
to
do
first
send
away
your
chemist
and
secretary
you
still
wish
it
decidedly
very
well
then
the
regent
signed
to
them
to
leave
they
did
so
and
now
said
he
what
is
it
i
want
to
present
to
you
monseigneur
a
young
man
a
very
delightful
fellow
just
arrived
from
bretagne
and
strongly
recommended
to
me
his
name
the
chevalier
gaston
de
chanlay
de
chanlay
said
the
regent
the
name
is
not
unknown
to
me
indeed
yes
i
think
i
have
heard
it
formerly
but
i
do
not
remember
where
or
how
what
does
your
protégé
come
to
paris
for
monseigneur
i
shall
leave
him
to
tell
you
that
himself
tell
it
to
me
yes
that
is
to
say
to
the
duc
whom
you
are
about
to
personate
ah
my
protégé
is
a
discreet
conspirator
and
i
have
had
some
trouble
to
get
at
the
truth
of
things
he
was
addressed
to
paris
to
a
certain
la
jonquiere
who
was
to
present
him
to
the
duc
do
you
understand
now
not
at
all
well
i
have
been
captain
la
jonquiere
but
i
can
not
be
both
la
jonquiere
and
his
excellency
so
you
reserve
that
part
for
you
monseigneur
thank
you
so
you
think
that
under
a
false
name
i
will
get
at
the
secrets
of
your
enemies
monseigneur
interrupted
dubois
pardieu
what
a
dreadful
crime
and
how
it
would
distress
you
to
change
name
and
dress
you
have
never
before
learned
secrets
by
such
means
but
remember
monseigneur
our
many
disguises
and
after
being
called
alain
and
maitre
jean
you
may
well
i
think
without
anything
derogatory
to
your
dignity
be
called
le
duc
i
ask
no
better
than
a
disguise
for
amusement
but
but
a
disguise
continued
dubois
to
preserve
the
peace
of
france
to
prevent
traitors
from
overthrowing
the
kingdom
to
prevent
assassins
from
murdering
you
this
i
suppose
is
unworthy
of
you
i
understand
ah
if
it
were
only
in
pursuit
of
some
little
ironmongress
in
the
pont
neuf
or
the
pretty
widow
of
the
rue
saint
augustine
it
might
be
worth
your
while
if
i
do
what
you
wish
said
the
regent
what
will
be
the
result
probably
that
you
will
own
that
i
am
no
visionary
and
that
you
will
allow
others
to
watch
over
you
since
you
will
not
watch
over
yourself
but
once
for
all
if
the
thing
turns
out
not
worth
the
trouble
shall
i
be
freed
from
your
worrying
i
promise
you
on
my
honor
abbe
if
you
have
no
objection
i
should
prefer
another
oath
oh
monseigneur
you
are
too
hard
but
you
consent
again
this
folly
you
shall
see
if
it
be
folly
i
believe
you
make
plots
to
frighten
me
then
they
are
well
made
you
shall
see
are
you
certain
absolutely
if
i
am
not
frightened
look
to
yourself
monseigneur
exacts
too
much
you
are
not
sure
dubois
i
swear
to
you
monsieur
that
you
will
be
moved
and
will
be
glad
to
speak
with
his
excellency
tongue
and
dubois
went
out
before
the
regent
had
time
to
withdraw
his
consent
five
minutes
after
a
courier
entered
the
antechamber
and
gave
a
letter
to
a
page
who
brought
it
to
the
regent
madame
desroches
said
he
looking
at
the
writing
and
breaking
the
seal
read
as
follows
monseigneur
the
young
lady
you
left
in
my
charge
does
not
appear
to
be
in
safety
here
bah
exclaimed
the
regent
and
then
read
on
the
residence
in
the
town
which
your
highness
feared
for
her
would
be
a
hundred
times
better
than
isolation
and
i
do
not
feel
strong
enough
to
defend
her
as
i
would
wish
and
as
i
ought
ouais
said
the
regent
it
seems
something
is
the
matter
a
young
man
who
had
written
to
mademoiselle
helene
shortly
before
your
arrival
yesterday
presented
himself
this
morning
at
the
pavilion
i
wished
to
refuse
him
admittance
but
mademoiselle
so
peremptorily
ordered
me
to
admit
him
and
to
retire
that
in
her
look
and
tone
i
recognized
the
blood
which
commands
yes
yes
said
the
regent
she
is
indeed
my
daughter
but
who
can
this
young
man
be
some
coxcomb
she
must
have
seen
in
the
convent
parlor
then
he
read
on
i
believe
monseigneur
that
this
young
man
and
mademoiselle
have
met
before
i
did
not
think
it
wrong
to
listen
for
your
highness
service
and
in
spite
of
the
double
door
i
once
heard
him
say
see
you
as
formerly
will
your
royal
highness
secure
me
against
this
danger
and
send
me
a
written
order
which
i
can
use
to
shelter
myself
from
the
anger
of
mademoiselle
diable
exclaimed
the
regent
it
can
not
be
a
love
affair
already
brought
up
in
the
only
convent
in
france
where
men
never
pass
the
parlor
no
it
is
some
foolish
fear
of
madame
desroches
but
let
us
see
what
else
she
writes
i
have
just
been
to
the
hotel
for
information
the
young
man
arrived
yesterday
evening
at
seven
just
of
an
hour
before
mademoiselle
he
came
by
the
bretagne
road
that
is
the
road
she
also
came
he
travels
under
the
name
of
de
livry
oh
said
the
regent
this
looks
like
a
concerted
plan
pardieu
dubois
would
laugh
if
he
knew
this
how
he
would
talk
it
is
to
be
hoped
he
knows
nothing
of
it
in
spite
of
his
police
hola
page
the
page
who
had
brought
the
letter
entered
where
is
the
messenger
from
rambouillet
he
is
waiting
for
an
answer
give
him
this
and
tell
him
to
start
at
once
as
to
dubois
while
preparing
the
interview
between
gaston
and
the
false
duke
he
made
the
following
calculation
i
hold
the
regent
both
by
himself
and
his
daughter
this
intrigue
of
his
is
either
serious
or
not
if
it
be
not
i
distress
her
in
exaggerating
it
if
it
be
serious
i
have
the
merit
of
having
discovered
it
but
i
must
not
strike
both
blows
at
once
first
i
must
save
the
duke
then
his
daughter
and
there
will
be
two
is
that
the
best
yes
the
duke
first
if
a
young
girl
falls
no
one
suffers
if
a
man
falls
a
kingdom
is
lost
let
us
begin
with
the
duke
and
dubois
dispatched
a
courier
to
de
montaran
at
nantes
de
montaran
was
as
we
have
said
the
ancient
governor
of
bretagne
as
to
gaston
his
plan
was
fixed
ashamed
of
being
associated
with
a
man
like
jonquiere
he
congratulated
himself
that
he
was
now
to
communicate
with
the
chief
of
the
enterprise
and
resolved
if
he
also
appeared
base
and
venial
to
return
and
take
counsel
with
his
friends
at
nantes
as
to
helene
he
doubted
not
he
knew
her
courage
and
her
love
and
that
she
would
die
rather
than
have
to
blush
before
her
dearest
friend
he
saw
with
joy
that
the
happiness
of
finding
a
father
did
not
lead
her
to
forget
the
past
but
still
he
had
his
fears
as
to
this
mysterious
paternity
even
a
king
would
own
such
a
daughter
were
there
not
some
disgraceful
obstacle
gaston
dressed
himself
carefully
there
is
a
coquetry
in
danger
as
well
as
in
pleasure
and
he
embellished
his
youth
with
every
advantage
of
costume
the
regent
by
dubois
advice
dressed
in
black
velvet
and
half
hid
his
face
in
an
immense
cravat
of
mechlin
lace
the
interview
was
to
take
place
in
a
house
belonging
to
the
regent
in
the
faubourg
saint
germain
he
arrived
there
at
five
as
night
was
falling
chapter
xvi
monseigneur
we
are
bretons
gaston
remained
in
the
room
on
the
and
dressed
himself
carefully
as
we
have
said
while
tapin
continued
his
apprenticeship
by
the
evening
he
knew
how
to
measure
a
pint
as
well
as
his
predecessor
and
even
better
for
he
thought
that
in
the
compensation
which
would
be
given
to
bourguignon
waste
would
be
considered
and
that
therefore
the
less
waste
the
better
so
the
morning
customer
on
her
return
got
badly
served
and
went
off
disgusted
when
his
toilet
was
finished
gaston
began
to
inspect
la
library
and
found
it
composed
of
three
sets
of
books
theatrical
books
obscene
books
and
arithmetical
books
while
he
was
thus
engaged
a
man
entered
introduced
by
tapin
who
went
out
directly
and
left
him
alone
with
gaston
the
man
announced
that
captain
la
jonquiere
not
being
able
to
return
had
sent
him
in
his
stead
gaston
demanding
proof
the
man
showed
a
letter
in
the
same
terms
and
the
same
writing
as
the
specimen
gaston
had
received
and
then
the
half
coin
after
which
gaston
made
no
difficulty
as
to
following
him
and
both
got
into
a
carefully
closed
carriage
they
crossed
the
and
in
the
rue
du
bac
stopped
at
the
courtyard
of
a
pavilion
then
the
man
drew
from
his
pocket
the
paper
bearing
the
chevalier
name
as
the
third
signal
of
recognition
gaston
and
his
companion
alighted
ascended
the
four
steps
of
the
doorway
and
entered
a
large
circular
corridor
surrounding
the
pavilion
gaston
looked
round
and
saw
that
his
guide
had
disappeared
and
that
he
was
alone
his
heart
beat
quickly
he
was
about
to
face
not
the
tool
but
the
master
and
originator
of
the
whole
plot
the
representative
of
a
king
he
was
to
play
a
kingdom
against
a
kingdom
a
bell
sounded
within
gaston
almost
trembled
he
looked
in
a
glass
and
saw
that
he
was
pale
a
thousand
new
ideas
assailed
him
the
door
opened
and
la
jonquiere
appeared
come
chevalier
said
he
we
are
expected
gaston
advanced
with
a
firm
step
they
found
a
man
seated
in
an
armchair
his
back
turned
to
the
door
a
single
light
placed
on
a
table
and
covered
with
a
shade
lighted
only
the
lower
part
of
his
body
his
head
and
shoulders
were
in
shadow
gaston
thought
the
face
noble
and
understood
at
once
that
this
was
a
man
of
worth
and
no
la
jonquiere
the
mouth
was
benevolent
and
the
eyes
large
bold
and
firm
like
those
of
a
king
or
a
bird
of
prey
deep
thought
was
written
on
his
brow
prudence
and
some
degree
of
firmness
in
the
lower
part
of
the
face
all
this
however
in
the
and
in
spite
of
the
mechlin
cravat
at
least
this
is
an
eagle
thought
he
the
other
was
but
a
raven
gaston
bowed
silently
and
the
unknown
rising
went
and
leaned
against
the
chimney
monsieur
is
the
person
of
whom
i
spoke
to
your
excellency
said
la
jonquiere
le
chevalier
gaston
de
chanlay
the
unknown
bowed
silently
mordieu
whispered
dubois
in
his
ear
if
you
do
not
speak
he
will
not
say
anything
this
gentleman
comes
from
bretagne
i
believe
said
the
duke
coldly
yes
monsieur
but
will
your
excellency
pardon
me
captain
la
jonquiere
has
told
my
name
but
i
have
not
been
told
yours
excuse
my
rudeness
monseigneur
it
is
not
i
who
speak
it
is
my
province
which
sends
me
you
are
right
monsieur
said
la
jonquiere
quickly
taking
from
a
portfolio
on
the
table
a
paper
at
the
bottom
of
which
was
a
large
signature
with
the
seal
of
the
king
of
spain
here
is
the
name
said
he
duc
read
gaston
then
turning
to
him
he
bowed
respectfully
and
now
monsieur
said
the
duke
you
will
not
i
presume
hesitate
to
speak
i
thought
i
had
first
to
listen
said
gaston
still
on
the
defensive
true
but
remember
it
is
a
dialogue
each
one
speaks
in
turn
monseigneur
you
do
me
too
much
honor
and
i
will
set
the
example
of
confidence
i
listen
monsieur
monseigneur
the
states
of
bretagne
the
malcontents
of
bretagne
interrupted
the
regent
smiling
in
spite
of
a
sign
from
dubois
the
malcontents
are
so
numerous
replied
gaston
that
they
may
be
considered
the
representatives
of
the
province
however
i
will
employ
the
word
your
excellency
points
out
the
malcontents
of
bretagne
have
sent
me
to
you
monseigneur
to
learn
the
intentions
of
spain
in
this
affair
first
let
us
learn
those
of
bretagne
monseigneur
spain
may
count
on
us
we
pledge
our
word
and
breton
loyalty
is
proverbial
but
what
do
you
promise
to
second
the
efforts
of
the
french
nobility
but
are
you
not
french
monseigneur
we
are
bretons
bretagne
reunited
to
france
by
a
treaty
may
look
on
herself
as
separated
from
the
moment
when
france
no
longer
respects
the
rights
of
that
treaty
yes
i
know
the
old
story
of
anne
de
bretagne
contract
it
is
a
long
time
since
that
contract
was
signed
monsieur
the
false
la
jonquiere
pushed
the
regent
violently
what
matter
said
gaston
if
each
one
of
us
has
it
by
heart
chapter
xvii
monsieur
andre
you
said
that
the
breton
nobility
were
ready
to
second
the
french
nobility
now
what
do
the
french
nobility
want
they
desire
in
case
of
his
majesty
death
to
place
the
king
of
spain
on
the
throne
of
france
as
sole
heir
of
louis
xiv
very
good
very
good
said
la
jonquiere
taking
snuff
with
an
air
of
extreme
satisfaction
but
said
the
regent
the
king
is
not
dead
although
you
speak
almost
as
if
he
were
the
grand
dauphin
the
duc
and
duchesse
de
bourgogne
and
their
children
disappeared
in
a
deplorable
manner
the
regent
turned
pale
with
anger
dubois
coughed
then
they
reckon
on
the
king
death
generally
monseigneur
then
that
explains
how
the
king
of
spain
hopes
in
spite
of
the
renunciation
of
his
rights
to
mount
the
throne
of
france
but
among
the
people
attached
to
the
regency
he
may
meet
with
some
opposition
the
false
spaniard
involuntarily
lingered
on
these
words
monseigneur
replied
the
chevalier
this
case
also
has
been
foreseen
ah
said
dubois
this
has
been
foreseen
did
not
i
tell
you
monseigneur
that
the
bretons
were
valuable
to
us
continue
monsieur
continue
in
spite
of
this
invitation
gaston
was
silent
well
monsieur
said
the
pretended
duke
i
am
listening
this
secret
is
not
mine
monseigneur
then
said
the
duke
i
have
not
the
confidence
of
your
chiefs
on
the
contrary
you
alone
have
it
i
understand
monsieur
but
the
captain
is
my
friend
and
i
answer
for
him
as
for
myself
my
instructions
are
monseigneur
to
speak
to
you
alone
but
i
tell
you
i
answer
for
the
captain
in
that
case
said
gaston
bowing
i
have
said
all
i
have
to
say
you
hear
captain
said
the
regent
have
the
kindness
to
leave
us
alone
yes
monseigneur
i
have
but
two
words
to
say
to
you
gaston
drew
back
monseigneur
whispered
dubois
press
him
hard
get
out
the
whole
affair
you
will
never
have
such
another
chance
what
do
you
think
of
our
breton
a
noble
fellow
eyes
full
of
intelligence
and
a
fine
head
so
much
the
better
for
cutting
it
off
what
do
you
say
nothing
monseigneur
i
am
exactly
of
your
opinion
de
chanlay
your
humble
servant
some
might
be
angry
that
you
would
not
speak
before
them
but
i
am
not
proud
and
provided
all
things
turn
out
as
i
expect
i
do
not
care
for
the
means
chanlay
bowed
monsieur
said
the
regent
when
dubois
had
closed
the
door
we
are
alone
and
i
am
listening
speak
you
understand
my
impatience
yes
monseigneur
you
are
doubtless
surprised
that
you
have
not
yet
received
from
spain
a
certain
dispatch
which
you
were
to
send
to
cardinal
olocroni
true
monsieur
said
the
regent
dissembling
with
difficulty
i
will
explain
the
delay
the
messenger
who
should
have
brought
this
dispatch
fell
ill
and
has
not
left
madrid
the
baron
de
valef
my
friend
who
was
in
spain
offered
himself
and
after
three
or
four
day
hesitation
at
length
as
he
was
a
man
already
tried
in
cellamare
conspiracy
they
trusted
him
in
fact
said
the
regent
the
baron
de
valef
narrowly
escaped
dubois
emissaries
it
needed
some
courage
to
renew
such
a
work
i
know
that
when
the
regent
saw
madame
de
maine
and
cellamare
arrested
richelieu
polignac
malezieux
and
mademoiselle
de
launay
in
the
bastille
and
that
wretched
at
the
sainte
marguerite
he
thought
all
was
finished
you
see
he
was
mistaken
monseigneur
but
do
not
these
breton
conspirators
fear
that
in
thus
rising
they
may
sacrifice
the
heads
of
the
paris
conspirators
whom
the
regent
has
in
his
power
they
hope
to
save
them
or
die
with
them
how
save
them
let
us
return
to
the
dispatch
if
you
please
monseigneur
here
it
is
the
regent
took
the
paper
but
seeing
the
address
to
his
excellency
the
duc
laid
it
on
the
table
unopened
strange
inconsistency
this
man
opened
two
hundred
letters
a
day
by
his
spies
it
is
true
that
then
he
dealt
with
a
thorey
or
a
dubois
and
not
with
a
chevalier
de
chanlay
well
monseigneur
said
gaston
you
know
doubtless
what
this
dispatch
contains
monsieur
not
word
for
word
perhaps
but
i
know
what
was
arranged
well
tell
me
i
shall
be
glad
to
know
how
far
you
are
admitted
into
the
secrets
of
the
spanish
cabinet
when
the
regent
is
got
rid
of
said
gaston
without
noticing
the
slight
start
which
his
interlocutor
gave
at
these
words
the
duc
de
maine
will
be
provisionally
recognized
in
his
place
the
duc
de
maine
will
at
once
break
the
treaty
of
the
quadruple
alliance
signed
by
that
wretch
dubois
i
wish
la
jonquiere
had
been
here
to
hear
you
speak
thus
it
would
have
pleased
him
go
on
monsieur
the
pretender
will
start
with
a
fleet
for
the
english
shore
prussia
sweden
and
russia
will
then
be
engaged
with
holland
the
empire
will
profit
by
this
war
to
retake
naples
and
sicily
to
which
it
lays
claim
through
the
house
of
suabia
the
grand
duchy
of
tuscany
will
be
assured
to
the
second
son
of
the
king
of
spain
the
catholic
low
countries
will
be
to
france
sardinia
given
to
the
duke
of
savoy
commachio
to
the
pope
france
will
be
the
soul
of
the
great
league
of
the
south
against
the
north
and
if
louis
xv
dies
philip
will
be
crowned
king
of
half
the
world
yes
i
know
all
that
said
the
regent
and
this
is
conspiracy
renewed
but
you
used
a
phrase
i
did
not
understand
which
monseigneur
you
said
when
the
regent
is
got
rid
of
how
is
he
to
be
got
rid
of
the
old
plan
was
as
you
know
to
carry
him
off
to
the
prison
of
saragossa
or
the
fortress
of
toledo
yes
and
the
plan
failed
through
the
duke
watchfulness
it
was
impracticable
a
thousand
obstacles
opposed
it
how
was
it
possible
to
take
such
a
prisoner
across
france
it
was
difficult
said
the
duke
i
never
understood
the
adoption
of
such
a
plan
i
am
glad
to
find
it
modified
monseigneur
it
would
be
possible
to
seduce
guards
to
escape
from
a
prison
or
a
fortress
to
return
to
france
retake
a
lost
power
and
punish
those
who
had
executed
this
abduction
philip
and
alberoni
have
nothing
to
fear
his
excellency
the
duc
regains
the
frontier
in
safety
and
while
half
the
conspirators
escape
the
other
half
pay
for
all
however
monseigneur
we
have
the
example
of
the
last
conspiracy
before
our
eyes
and
you
yourself
named
those
who
are
in
the
bastille
what
you
say
is
most
logical
replied
the
duke
while
on
the
contrary
in
getting
rid
of
the
regent
continued
the
chevalier
yes
you
prevent
his
return
it
is
possible
to
return
from
a
prison
but
not
from
a
tomb
that
is
what
you
would
say
yes
monseigneur
replied
gaston
with
a
somewhat
tremulous
voice
now
i
understand
your
mission
you
come
to
paris
to
make
away
with
the
regent
yes
monseigneur
explain
yourself
we
were
five
breton
gentlemen
forming
a
small
party
or
league
in
the
midst
of
the
general
association
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
majority
should
decide
on
our
plans
i
understand
and
the
majority
decided
that
the
regent
should
be
assassinated
yes
monseigneur
four
were
for
assassination
and
one
against
it
and
that
one
if
i
lose
your
excellency
confidence
i
must
own
that
i
was
that
one
but
then
why
are
you
to
accomplish
a
design
you
disapprove
chance
was
to
decide
the
one
who
should
strike
the
blow
and
the
lot
fell
on
me
monseigneur
why
did
you
not
refuse
the
ballot
was
without
names
no
one
knew
my
vote
i
should
have
been
taken
for
a
coward
and
you
came
to
paris
for
the
task
imposed
on
me
reckoning
on
me
as
on
an
enemy
of
the
regent
for
aid
in
accomplishing
an
enterprise
which
not
only
concerns
the
interests
of
spain
but
which
will
save
our
friends
from
the
bastille
do
they
run
as
much
danger
as
you
believe
death
hovers
over
them
the
regent
has
proofs
and
has
said
of
de
richelieu
that
if
he
had
four
heads
he
has
wherewith
to
condemn
them
all
he
said
that
in
a
moment
of
passion
what
monseigneur
you
defend
the
duke
you
tremble
when
a
man
devotes
himself
to
save
not
only
his
accomplices
but
two
kingdoms
you
hesitate
to
accept
that
devotion
if
you
fail
everything
has
its
good
and
evil
side
if
the
happiness
of
being
the
savior
of
a
country
is
lost
the
honor
of
being
a
martyr
to
its
cause
is
gained
but
remember
in
facilitating
your
access
to
the
regent
i
become
your
accomplice
does
that
frighten
you
monseigneur
certainly
for
you
being
arrested
well
i
being
arrested
they
may
force
from
you
by
means
of
tortures
the
names
of
those
gaston
reply
was
a
smile
of
supreme
disdain
you
are
a
foreigner
and
a
spaniard
monseigneur
said
he
and
do
not
know
what
a
french
gentleman
is
therefore
i
pardon
you
then
i
may
reckon
on
your
silence
pontcalec
du
couëdic
talhouet
and
montlouis
doubted
me
for
an
instant
and
have
since
apologized
to
me
for
doing
so
well
monsieur
i
will
think
seriously
of
what
you
have
said
but
in
your
place
in
my
place
i
would
renounce
this
enterprise
i
wish
i
had
never
entered
into
it
monseigneur
i
own
for
since
i
did
so
a
great
change
has
taken
place
in
my
life
but
i
am
in
it
and
must
accomplish
it
even
if
i
refuse
to
second
you
the
breton
committee
have
provided
for
that
emergency
and
decided
to
do
without
you
then
your
resolution
is
irrevocable
i
have
said
all
i
had
to
say
replied
the
regent
since
you
are
determined
to
pursue
your
undertaking
monseigneur
said
gaston
you
seem
to
wish
to
retire
have
you
anything
more
to
say
to
me
not
or
the
day
after
you
have
the
captain
as
when
he
gives
me
notice
i
will
receive
you
with
pleasure
monseigneur
said
gaston
firmly
and
with
a
noble
air
let
me
speak
freely
we
should
have
no
you
and
i
so
evidently
separated
by
rank
and
station
are
equal
before
the
scaffold
which
threatens
us
i
have
even
a
superiority
over
you
since
i
run
the
greater
danger
however
you
are
now
monseigneur
a
conspirator
like
the
chevalier
de
chanlay
with
this
difference
that
you
have
the
right
being
the
chief
to
see
his
head
fall
before
yours
let
me
then
treat
as
an
equal
with
your
excellency
and
see
you
when
it
is
necessary
the
regent
thought
for
a
moment
very
well
said
he
this
house
is
not
my
residence
you
understand
i
do
not
receive
many
at
my
house
since
the
war
my
position
is
precarious
and
delicate
in
france
cellamare
is
in
prison
at
blois
i
am
only
a
sort
of
consul
good
as
a
hostage
i
can
not
use
too
many
precautions
the
regent
lied
with
a
painful
effort
write
then
poste
restante
to
andre
you
must
name
the
time
at
which
you
wish
to
see
me
and
i
will
be
there
through
the
post
asked
gaston
yes
it
is
only
a
delay
of
three
hours
at
each
post
a
man
will
watch
for
your
letter
and
bring
it
to
me
when
it
arrives
three
hours
after
you
can
come
here
your
excellency
forgets
said
gaston
laughing
that
i
do
not
know
where
i
am
in
what
street
at
what
number
i
came
by
night
stay
let
us
do
better
than
that
you
asked
for
time
to
reflect
take
till
morning
and
at
eleven
send
for
me
we
must
arrange
a
plan
beforehand
that
it
may
not
fail
like
those
plans
where
a
carriage
or
a
shower
of
rain
disconcerts
everything
that
is
a
good
idea
said
the
regent
then
at
eleven
you
shall
be
fetched
and
we
will
then
have
no
secrets
from
each
other
gaston
bowed
and
retired
in
the
antechamber
he
found
the
guide
who
brought
him
but
he
noticed
that
in
leaving
they
crossed
a
garden
which
they
had
not
passed
through
on
entering
and
went
out
by
a
different
door
at
this
door
the
carriage
waited
and
it
quickly
arrived
at
the
rue
des
bourdonnais
chapter
xviii
the
faubourg
saint
antoine
no
more
illusion
for
the
chevalier
in
a
day
or
two
he
might
be
called
to
his
work
the
spanish
envoy
had
deeply
impressed
gaston
there
was
about
him
an
air
of
greatness
which
surprised
him
a
strange
circumstance
passed
across
his
mind
there
was
between
his
forehead
and
eyes
and
those
of
helene
one
of
those
vague
and
distant
likenesses
which
seem
almost
like
the
incoherence
of
a
dream
gaston
without
knowing
why
associated
these
two
faces
in
his
memory
and
could
not
separate
them
as
he
was
about
to
lie
down
worn
out
with
fatigue
a
horse
feet
sounded
in
the
street
the
hotel
door
opened
and
gaston
heard
an
animated
conversation
but
soon
the
door
was
closed
the
noise
ceased
and
he
slept
as
a
man
sleeps
at
even
if
he
be
a
conspirator
however
gaston
was
not
mistaken
a
horse
had
arrived
and
a
conversation
had
taken
place
a
peasant
from
rambouillet
brought
in
haste
a
note
from
a
young
and
pretty
woman
to
the
chevalier
de
chanlay
hotel
muids
we
can
imagine
who
the
young
and
pretty
woman
was
tapin
took
the
letter
looked
at
it
then
taking
off
his
apron
left
the
charge
of
the
hotel
to
one
of
his
servants
and
went
off
to
dubois
oh
exclaimed
the
latter
let
us
see
a
letter
he
unsealed
it
skillfully
by
aid
of
steam
and
on
reading
it
seemed
pleased
good
excellent
let
them
alone
to
go
their
own
way
we
hold
the
reins
and
can
stop
them
when
we
like
then
turning
to
tapin
he
gave
him
the
letter
which
he
had
resealed
here
said
he
deliver
the
letter
when
asked
tapin
at
once
tapin
stepped
toward
the
door
no
stop
said
dubois
morning
will
be
soon
enough
now
said
tapin
may
i
make
an
observation
speak
as
monseigneur
agent
i
gain
three
crowns
a
day
well
is
not
that
enough
you
scoundrel
it
was
enough
as
agent
i
do
not
complain
but
it
is
not
enough
as
oh
the
horrid
trade
drink
and
amuse
yourself
since
i
have
sold
wine
i
hate
it
because
you
see
how
it
is
made
but
drink
champagne
muscat
anything
bourguignon
pays
apropos
he
has
had
a
real
attack
so
your
lie
was
only
an
affair
of
chronology
indeed
yes
fear
has
caused
it
you
want
to
inherit
his
goods
no
no
the
trade
is
not
amusing
well
i
will
add
three
crowns
a
day
to
your
pay
while
you
are
there
and
i
will
give
the
shop
to
your
eldest
daughter
bring
me
such
letters
often
and
you
shall
be
welcome
tapin
returned
to
the
hotel
but
waited
for
the
morning
to
deliver
the
letter
at
six
hearing
gaston
moving
he
entered
and
gave
him
the
note
this
was
what
it
contained
my
friend
i
think
of
your
advice
and
that
perhaps
you
were
right
at
last
i
fear
a
carriage
has
just
arrived
madame
desroches
orders
departure
i
tried
to
resist
they
shut
me
up
in
my
room
fortunately
a
peasant
passed
by
to
water
his
horse
i
have
given
him
two
louis
and
he
promised
to
take
you
this
note
i
hear
the
last
preparations
in
two
hours
we
leave
for
paris
on
my
arrival
i
will
send
you
my
address
if
i
have
to
jump
out
of
the
window
and
bring
it
be
assured
the
woman
who
loves
you
will
remain
worthy
of
herself
and
you
ah
helene
cried
gaston
i
was
not
deceived
eight
but
she
must
have
arrived
why
was
not
this
letter
brought
to
me
at
once
you
were
asleep
monsieur
i
waited
your
awaking
there
was
no
reply
to
be
made
gaston
thought
he
would
go
and
watch
at
the
barrier
as
helene
might
not
have
arrived
he
dressed
quickly
and
set
out
after
saying
to
tapin
if
captain
la
jonquiere
comes
here
say
i
shall
be
back
at
nine
while
gaston
waits
uselessly
for
helene
let
us
look
back
we
saw
the
regent
receive
madame
desroches
letter
and
send
a
reply
indeed
it
was
necessary
to
remove
helene
from
the
attempts
of
this
de
livry
but
who
could
he
be
dubois
alone
could
tell
so
when
dubois
appeared
dubois
said
the
regent
who
is
de
livry
of
nantes
livry
livry
said
he
stay
yes
livry
who
knows
such
a
name
send
for
m
idiot
but
monseigneur
i
do
not
study
genealogies
i
am
an
unworthy
plebeian
a
truce
to
this
folly
diable
it
seems
monseigneur
is
in
earnest
about
these
livrys
are
you
going
to
give
the
order
to
one
of
them
because
in
that
case
i
will
try
and
find
a
noble
origin
go
to
the
devil
and
send
me
nocé
dubois
smiled
and
went
out
nocé
quickly
appeared
he
was
a
man
about
forty
tall
handsome
cold
and
witty
one
of
the
regent
most
faithful
and
favorite
friends
monseigneur
sent
for
me
ah
nocé
can
i
serve
your
royal
highness
in
anything
yes
lend
me
your
house
in
the
faubourg
antoine
but
empty
and
carefully
arranged
i
will
put
my
own
people
in
it
is
it
to
be
for
for
a
prude
nocé
the
houses
in
the
faubourg
have
a
bad
name
monseigneur
the
person
for
whom
i
require
it
does
not
know
that
remember
absolute
silence
nocé
and
give
me
the
keys
a
quarter
of
an
hour
monseigneur
and
you
shall
have
them
adieu
nocé
your
hand
no
spying
no
curiosity
i
beg
monseigneur
i
am
going
to
hunt
and
shall
only
return
at
your
pleasure
thanks
adieu
till
the
regent
sat
down
and
wrote
to
madame
desroches
sending
a
carriage
with
an
order
to
bring
helene
after
reading
her
the
letter
without
showing
it
to
her
the
letter
was
as
follows
my
daughter
on
reflection
i
wish
to
have
you
near
me
therefore
follow
madame
desroches
without
loss
of
time
on
your
arrival
at
paris
you
shall
hear
from
me
your
affectionate
father
illustration
philip
page
helene
resisted
prayed
wept
but
was
forced
to
obey
she
profited
by
a
moment
of
solitude
to
write
to
gaston
as
we
have
seen
then
she
left
this
dwelling
which
had
become
dear
to
her
for
there
she
had
found
her
father
and
received
her
lover
as
to
gaston
he
waited
vainly
at
the
barrier
till
giving
up
all
hope
he
returned
to
the
hotel
as
he
crossed
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
eight
struck
at
that
moment
dubois
entered
the
regent
bedchamber
with
a
portfolio
under
his
arm
and
a
triumphant
smile
on
his
face
chapter
xix
the
artist
and
the
politician
ah
it
is
you
dubois
exclaimed
the
regent
as
his
minister
entered
yes
monseigneur
said
dubois
taking
out
some
papers
well
what
do
you
say
to
our
bretons
now
what
papers
are
those
asked
the
regent
who
in
spite
of
the
preceding
day
conversation
or
perhaps
because
of
it
felt
a
secret
sympathy
with
de
chanlay
oh
nothing
at
all
first
a
little
report
of
what
passed
yesterday
evening
between
de
chanlay
and
his
excellency
the
duc
you
listened
then
said
the
regent
pardieu
monseigneur
what
did
you
expect
that
i
should
do
and
you
heard
all
what
do
you
think
of
his
catholic
majesty
pretensions
i
think
that
perhaps
they
use
his
name
without
his
consent
and
cardinal
alberoni
tudieu
monseigneur
how
nicely
they
manage
europe
the
pretender
in
england
prussia
sweden
and
russia
tearing
holland
to
pieces
the
empire
recovering
sicily
and
naples
the
grand
duchy
of
tuscany
for
philip
the
fifth
son
sardinia
for
the
king
of
savoy
commanchio
for
the
pope
france
for
spain
really
this
plan
is
somewhat
grand
to
emanate
from
the
brain
of
a
all
smoke
these
prospects
said
the
duke
mere
dreams
and
the
breton
league
is
that
all
smoke
i
am
forced
to
own
that
that
really
exists
and
the
dagger
of
our
conspirator
is
that
a
dream
no
it
even
appeared
to
me
likely
to
be
vigorously
handled
peste
monseigneur
you
complained
in
the
other
plot
that
you
found
none
but
conspirators
well
this
time
i
hope
you
are
better
pleased
these
fellows
strike
hard
do
you
know
said
the
regent
thoughtfully
that
the
chevalier
de
chanlay
is
of
an
energetic
and
vigorous
nature
ah
the
next
thing
will
be
you
will
conceive
a
great
admiration
for
this
fellow
i
know
monseigneur
that
you
are
capable
of
it
how
is
it
that
a
prince
always
finds
such
natures
among
his
enemies
and
not
among
friends
because
monseigneur
hatred
is
a
passion
and
devotion
often
only
a
weakness
but
if
you
will
descend
from
the
height
of
philosophy
and
deign
to
a
simple
act
namely
to
give
me
two
signatures
what
signatures
asked
the
regent
first
there
is
a
captain
to
be
made
a
major
captain
la
jonquiere
oh
no
as
to
him
we
hang
him
when
we
have
done
with
him
but
meanwhile
we
must
treat
him
with
care
who
then
is
this
captain
a
brave
officer
whom
monseigneur
eight
days
or
rather
eight
nights
ago
met
in
a
house
in
the
rue
st
honoré
what
do
you
mean
ah
i
see
i
must
aid
your
memory
a
little
monseigneur
since
you
have
such
a
bad
one
speak
one
can
never
get
at
the
truth
with
you
in
two
words
eight
nights
ago
you
went
out
disguised
as
a
musketeer
through
the
little
door
in
the
rue
richelieu
accompanied
by
nocé
and
simiane
it
is
true
what
passed
in
the
rue
st
honore
do
you
wish
to
know
monseigneur
i
do
i
can
refuse
you
nothing
speak
then
you
supped
at
the
house
that
house
monseigneur
still
with
nocé
and
simiane
no
monseigneur
nocé
and
simiane
supped
too
but
separately
you
supped
then
and
were
at
table
when
a
brave
officer
who
probably
mistook
the
door
knocked
so
obstinately
at
yours
that
you
became
impatient
and
handled
the
unfortunate
who
disturbed
you
somewhat
roughly
but
he
who
it
seems
was
not
of
an
enduring
nature
took
out
his
sword
whereupon
you
monseigneur
who
never
look
twice
before
committing
a
folly
drew
your
rapier
and
tried
your
skill
with
the
officer
and
the
result
asked
the
regent
was
that
you
got
a
scratch
on
the
shoulder
in
return
for
which
you
bestowed
on
your
adversary
a
in
the
breast
but
it
was
not
dangerous
asked
the
regent
anxiously
no
fortunately
the
blade
glided
along
the
ribs
so
much
the
better
but
that
is
not
all
how
it
appears
that
you
owed
the
officer
a
special
grudge
i
had
never
seen
him
princes
strike
from
a
distance
what
do
you
mean
this
officer
had
been
a
captain
for
eight
years
when
on
your
highness
coming
into
power
he
was
dismissed
then
i
suppose
he
deserved
it
ah
monseigneur
you
would
make
us
out
as
infallible
as
the
pope
he
must
have
committed
some
cowardly
act
he
is
one
of
the
bravest
officers
in
the
service
some
infamous
act
then
he
is
the
most
honest
fellow
breathing
then
this
is
an
injustice
to
be
repaired
exactly
and
that
is
why
i
prepared
this
major
brevet
give
it
to
me
dubois
you
have
some
good
in
you
sometimes
a
diabolical
smile
passed
over
dubois
face
as
he
drew
from
his
portfolio
a
second
paper
the
regent
watched
him
uneasily
what
is
that
paper
asked
he
monseigneur
you
have
repaired
an
act
of
injustice
now
do
an
act
of
justice
the
order
to
arrest
the
chevalier
gaston
de
chanlay
and
place
him
in
the
bastille
cried
the
regent
ah
i
see
now
why
you
bribed
me
with
a
good
action
but
stay
this
requires
reflection
do
you
think
i
propose
to
you
an
abuse
of
power
monseigneur
asked
dubois
laughing
no
but
yet
monseigneur
continued
dubois
when
we
have
in
our
hands
the
government
of
a
kingdom
the
thing
most
necessary
is
to
govern
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
the
master
to
reward
yes
but
on
condition
of
punishing
the
balance
of
justice
is
destroyed
monseigneur
if
an
eternal
and
blind
mercy
weighs
down
one
of
the
scales
to
act
as
you
always
wish
and
often
do
is
not
good
but
weak
what
is
the
reward
of
virtue
if
you
do
not
punish
vice
then
said
the
regent
the
more
impatiently
that
he
felt
he
was
defending
a
bad
though
generous
cause
if
you
wished
me
to
be
severe
you
should
not
have
brought
about
an
interview
between
me
and
this
young
man
you
should
not
have
given
me
the
opportunity
of
appreciating
his
worth
but
have
allowed
me
to
suppose
him
a
common
conspirator
yes
and
now
because
he
presented
himself
to
your
highness
under
a
romantic
guise
your
artistic
imagination
runs
away
with
you
diable
monseigneur
there
is
a
time
for
everything
so
chemistry
with
hubert
engraving
with
audran
music
with
lafare
make
love
with
the
whole
world
but
politics
with
me
mon
dieu
said
the
regent
is
it
worth
while
to
defend
a
life
watched
tortured
calumniated
as
mine
is
but
it
is
not
your
life
you
are
defending
monseigneur
consider
among
all
these
calumnies
which
pursue
you
and
against
which
heaven
knows
you
should
be
steeled
by
this
time
your
most
bitter
enemies
have
never
accused
you
of
cowardice
as
to
your
life
at
steinkirk
at
nerwinden
and
at
lerida
you
proved
at
what
rate
you
valued
it
pardieu
if
you
were
merely
a
private
gentleman
a
minister
or
a
prince
of
the
blood
and
you
were
assassinated
a
man
heart
would
cease
to
beat
and
that
would
be
all
but
wrongly
or
rightly
you
coveted
a
place
among
the
powerful
ones
of
the
world
for
that
end
you
broke
the
will
of
louis
the
fourteenth
you
drove
the
bastards
from
the
throne
whereon
they
had
already
placed
their
feet
you
made
yourself
regent
of
france
that
is
to
say
the
keystone
of
the
arch
of
the
world
if
you
die
it
is
not
a
man
who
falls
it
is
the
pillar
which
supports
the
european
edifice
which
gives
way
thus
our
four
last
years
of
watchfulness
and
struggles
would
be
lost
and
everything
around
would
be
shaken
look
at
england
the
chevalier
de
saint
george
will
renew
the
mad
enterprises
of
the
pretender
look
at
holland
sweden
and
prussia
would
hunt
her
to
the
death
look
at
austria
her
eagle
seizes
venice
and
milan
as
an
indemnification
for
the
loss
of
spain
cast
your
eyes
on
france
no
longer
france
but
philip
the
fifth
vassal
look
finally
at
louis
the
fifteenth
the
last
descendant
of
the
greatest
monarch
that
ever
gave
light
to
the
world
and
the
child
whom
by
watchfulness
and
care
we
have
saved
from
the
fate
of
his
father
his
mother
and
his
uncles
to
place
him
safe
and
sound
on
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
this
child
falls
back
again
into
the
hands
of
those
whom
an
adulterous
law
boldly
calls
to
succeed
him
thus
on
all
sides
murder
desolation
ruin
civil
and
foreign
wars
and
why
because
it
pleases
monsieur
philippe
to
think
himself
still
major
of
the
king
troops
or
commandant
of
the
army
in
spain
and
to
forget
that
he
ceased
to
be
so
from
the
moment
he
became
regent
of
france
you
have
it
then
said
the
duke
stay
monseigneur
said
dubois
it
shall
not
be
said
that
in
an
affair
of
this
importance
you
gave
way
to
my
importunity
i
have
said
what
i
had
to
say
now
i
leave
you
do
as
you
please
i
leave
you
the
paper
i
am
going
to
give
some
orders
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
will
return
to
fetch
it
and
dubois
saluted
the
regent
and
went
out
left
alone
the
regent
became
thoughtful
this
whole
affair
so
somber
and
so
tenacious
of
life
this
remains
of
the
former
conspiracy
filled
the
duke
mind
with
gloomy
thoughts
he
had
braved
death
in
battle
had
laughed
at
abductions
meditated
by
the
spaniards
and
by
louis
the
fourteenth
bastards
but
this
time
a
secret
horror
oppressed
him
he
felt
an
involuntary
admiration
for
the
young
man
whose
poniard
was
raised
against
him
sometimes
he
hated
him
at
others
he
excused
he
almost
loved
him
dubois
cowering
down
over
this
conspiracy
like
an
infernal
ape
over
some
dying
prey
and
piercing
with
his
ravenous
claws
to
its
very
heart
seemed
to
him
to
possess
a
sublime
intelligence
and
power
he
felt
that
he
ordinarily
so
courageous
should
have
defended
his
life
feebly
in
this
instance
and
his
eyes
involuntarily
sought
the
paper
yes
murmured
he
dubois
is
right
my
life
is
no
longer
my
own
yesterday
my
mother
also
told
me
the
same
thing
who
knows
what
might
happen
if
i
were
to
fall
the
same
as
happened
at
the
death
of
my
ancestor
henry
the
fourth
perchance
after
having
reconquered
his
kingdom
step
by
step
he
was
about
thanks
to
ten
years
of
peace
economy
and
prosperity
to
add
alsace
lorraine
and
perhaps
flanders
to
france
while
the
duke
of
savoy
his
descending
the
alps
should
cut
out
for
himself
a
kingdom
in
the
milanais
and
with
the
leavings
of
that
kingdom
enrich
the
kingdom
of
venice
and
strengthen
the
dukes
of
modena
florence
and
mantua
everything
was
ready
for
the
immense
result
prepared
during
the
whole
life
of
a
king
who
was
at
once
a
legislator
and
a
soldier
then
the
of
may
arrived
a
carriage
with
the
royal
livery
passed
the
rue
de
la
feronniere
and
the
clock
of
les
innocents
struck
three
in
a
moment
all
was
destroyed
past
prosperity
hopes
of
the
future
it
needed
a
whole
century
a
minister
called
richelieu
and
a
king
called
louis
the
fourteenth
to
cicatrize
the
wound
made
in
france
by
ravaillac
knife
yes
dubois
was
right
cried
the
duke
and
i
must
abandon
this
young
man
to
human
justice
besides
it
is
not
i
who
condemn
him
the
judges
are
there
to
decide
and
added
he
with
animation
have
i
not
still
the
power
to
pardon
and
quieted
by
the
thought
of
this
royal
prerogative
which
he
exercised
in
the
name
of
louis
he
signed
the
paper
and
left
the
room
to
finish
dressing
ten
minutes
after
the
door
opened
softly
dubois
carefully
looked
in
saw
that
the
room
was
empty
approached
the
table
near
which
the
prince
had
been
seated
looked
rapidly
at
the
order
smiled
on
seeing
the
signature
and
folding
it
in
four
placed
it
in
his
pocket
and
left
the
room
with
an
air
of
great
satisfaction
chapter
xx
blood
reveals
itself
when
gaston
returned
from
the
barriere
de
la
conference
and
left
his
room
he
found
la
jonquiere
installed
by
the
fireplace
and
discussing
a
bottle
of
wine
which
he
had
just
uncorked
well
chevalier
said
he
as
gaston
entered
how
do
you
like
my
room
it
is
convenient
is
it
not
sit
down
and
taste
this
wine
it
rivals
the
best
rosseau
do
you
drink
rosseau
no
they
do
not
drink
wine
in
bretagne
they
drink
cider
or
beer
i
believe
i
never
could
get
anything
worth
drinking
there
except
brandy
gaston
did
not
reply
for
he
was
so
occupied
that
he
had
not
even
heard
what
la
jonquiere
said
he
threw
himself
in
an
easy
chair
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
holding
helene
first
letter
where
is
she
he
asked
himself
this
immense
unbounded
paris
may
keep
her
from
me
forever
oh
the
difficulty
is
too
great
for
a
man
without
power
or
experience
apropos
said
la
jonquiere
who
had
followed
the
young
man
ideas
easily
there
is
a
letter
for
you
from
bretagne
asked
the
chevalier
trembling
no
from
paris
a
beautiful
writing
evidently
a
woman
where
is
it
cried
gaston
ask
our
host
when
i
came
in
he
held
it
in
his
hands
give
it
to
me
cried
gaston
rushing
into
the
common
room
what
does
monsieur
want
asked
tapin
with
his
usual
politeness
my
letter
what
letter
the
letter
you
received
for
me
pardon
monsieur
i
forgot
it
and
he
gave
gaston
the
letter
poor
imbecile
said
the
false
la
jonquiere
and
these
idiots
think
of
conspiring
it
is
like
they
think
they
can
attend
to
love
and
politics
at
the
same
time
triple
fools
if
they
were
to
go
at
once
to
la
fillon
for
the
former
the
latter
would
not
be
so
likely
to
bring
them
to
the
place
de
greve
gaston
returned
joyously
reading
and
helene
letter
rue
de
faubourg
antoine
a
white
house
behind
trees
poplars
i
think
i
could
not
see
the
number
but
it
is
the
or
house
on
the
left
side
after
passing
a
chateau
with
towers
resembling
a
prison
oh
cried
gaston
i
can
find
that
it
is
the
bastille
dubois
overheard
these
words
parbleu
i
will
take
care
you
shall
find
it
if
i
lead
you
there
myself
gaston
looked
at
his
watch
and
finding
that
it
wanted
two
hours
of
the
time
appointed
for
his
rendezvous
in
the
rue
du
bac
took
up
his
hat
and
was
going
out
what
are
you
going
away
asked
dubois
i
am
obliged
to
do
so
and
our
appointment
for
eleven
it
is
not
yet
nine
you
do
not
want
me
no
thank
you
if
you
are
preparing
an
abduction
for
instance
i
am
an
adept
and
might
assist
you
thank
you
said
gaston
reddening
involuntarily
but
i
am
not
dubois
whistled
an
air
to
show
that
he
took
the
answer
for
what
it
was
worth
shall
i
find
you
here
on
my
return
asked
gaston
i
do
not
know
perhaps
i
also
have
to
reassure
some
pretty
creature
who
is
interested
in
me
but
at
any
rate
at
the
appointed
hour
you
will
find
your
yesterday
guide
with
the
same
carriage
and
the
same
coachman
gaston
took
a
hasty
leave
at
the
corner
of
the
cemetery
of
the
innocents
he
took
a
carriage
and
was
driven
to
the
rue
antoine
at
the
twentieth
house
he
alighted
ordering
the
driver
to
follow
him
then
he
proceeded
to
examine
the
left
side
of
the
street
he
soon
found
himself
facing
a
high
wall
over
which
he
saw
the
tops
of
some
tall
poplars
this
house
he
felt
sure
was
the
one
where
helene
was
but
here
his
difficulties
were
but
commencing
there
was
no
opening
in
the
wall
neither
bell
nor
knocker
at
the
door
those
who
came
with
couriers
galloping
before
them
to
strike
with
their
canes
could
dispense
with
a
knocker
gaston
was
afraid
to
strike
with
a
stone
for
fear
of
being
denied
admittance
he
therefore
ordered
the
coachman
to
stop
and
going
up
a
narrow
lane
by
one
side
of
the
house
he
imitated
the
cry
of
the
a
signal
preconcerted
helene
started
she
recognized
the
cry
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
she
were
again
in
the
augustine
convent
at
clissons
with
the
chevalier
boat
under
her
windows
she
ran
to
the
window
gaston
was
there
helene
and
he
exchanged
a
glance
then
the
room
she
rang
a
bell
which
madame
desroches
had
given
her
so
violently
that
two
servants
and
madame
desroches
herself
all
entered
at
once
go
and
open
the
door
said
helene
imperiously
there
is
some
one
at
the
door
whom
i
expect
stop
said
madame
desroches
to
the
valet
who
was
going
to
obey
i
will
go
myself
useless
madame
i
know
who
it
is
and
i
have
already
told
you
that
it
is
a
person
whom
i
expect
but
mademoiselle
ought
not
to
receive
this
person
replied
the
duenna
trying
to
stand
her
ground
i
am
no
longer
at
the
convent
madame
and
i
am
not
yet
in
prison
replied
helene
and
i
shall
receive
whom
i
please
but
at
least
i
may
know
who
this
is
i
see
no
objection
it
is
the
same
person
whom
i
received
at
rambouillet
de
livry
yes
i
have
positive
orders
not
to
allow
this
young
man
to
see
you
and
order
you
to
admit
him
instantly
mademoiselle
you
disobey
your
father
said
madame
desroches
half
angrily
half
respectfully
my
father
does
not
see
through
your
eyes
madame
yet
who
is
master
of
your
fate
i
alone
cried
helene
unwilling
to
allow
any
domination
mademoiselle
i
swear
to
you
that
your
father
will
approve
if
he
be
my
father
these
words
given
with
all
the
pride
of
an
empress
cowed
madame
desroches
and
she
had
recourse
to
silence
well
said
helene
i
ordered
that
the
door
should
be
opened
does
no
one
obey
when
i
command
no
one
stirred
they
waited
for
the
orders
of
madame
desroches
helene
smiled
scornfully
and
made
such
an
imperious
gesture
that
madame
desroches
moved
from
the
door
and
made
way
for
her
helene
then
slowly
and
with
dignity
descended
the
staircase
herself
followed
by
madame
desroches
who
was
petrified
to
find
such
a
will
in
a
young
girl
just
out
of
a
convent
she
is
a
queen
said
the
to
madame
desroches
i
know
i
should
have
gone
to
open
the
door
if
she
had
not
done
so
herself
alas
said
the
duenna
they
are
all
alike
in
that
family
do
you
know
the
family
then
asked
the
servant
astonished
madame
desroches
saw
that
she
had
said
too
much
yes
said
she
i
formerly
knew
the
marquis
her
father
meanwhile
helene
had
descended
the
staircase
crossed
the
court
and
opened
the
door
on
the
step
stood
gaston
come
my
friend
said
helene
gaston
followed
her
the
door
closed
behind
them
and
they
entered
a
room
on
the
you
called
me
and
i
am
here
helene
said
the
young
man
what
do
you
fear
what
dangers
threaten
you
look
around
you
said
helene
and
judge
the
room
in
which
they
were
was
a
charming
boudoir
adjoining
the
with
which
it
communicated
not
only
by
folding
doors
but
also
by
an
opening
almost
concealed
by
rare
and
peculiar
flowers
the
boudoir
was
hung
with
blue
satin
over
the
doors
were
pictures
by
claude
audran
representing
the
history
of
venus
in
four
tableaux
while
the
panels
formed
other
episodes
of
the
same
history
all
most
graceful
in
outline
and
voluptuous
in
expression
this
was
the
house
which
nocé
in
the
innocence
of
his
heart
had
designated
as
fit
for
a
prude
gaston
said
helene
i
wonder
whether
i
should
really
mistrust
this
man
who
calls
himself
my
father
my
fears
are
more
aroused
here
than
at
rambouillet
after
examining
the
boudoir
gaston
and
helene
passed
into
the
and
then
into
the
garden
which
was
ornamented
with
marble
statues
of
the
same
subjects
as
the
pictures
as
they
returned
they
passed
madame
desroches
who
had
not
lost
sight
of
them
and
who
raising
her
hands
in
a
despairing
manner
exclaimed
oh
mon
dieu
what
would
monseigneur
think
of
this
these
words
kindled
the
smoldering
fire
in
gaston
breast
monseigneur
cried
he
you
heard
helene
monseigneur
we
are
then
as
i
feared
in
the
house
of
one
of
those
great
men
who
purchase
pleasure
at
the
expense
of
honor
helene
do
not
allow
yourself
to
be
deceived
at
rambouillet
i
foresaw
danger
here
i
see
it
mon
dieu
said
helene
but
if
by
aid
of
his
valets
this
man
should
retain
me
here
by
force
do
not
fear
helene
am
not
i
here
oh
said
helene
and
must
i
renounce
the
sweet
idea
of
finding
a
father
a
preceptor
a
friend
and
at
what
a
moment
when
you
are
about
to
be
left
alone
in
the
world
said
gaston
unconsciously
betraying
a
part
of
his
secret
what
were
you
saying
gaston
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
words
nothing
nothing
replied
the
young
man
some
meaningless
words
which
escaped
me
and
to
which
you
must
not
attach
any
consequence
gaston
you
are
hiding
some
dreadful
secret
from
me
since
you
speak
of
abandoning
me
at
the
moment
i
lose
a
father
helene
i
will
never
abandon
you
except
with
life
ah
cried
the
young
girl
your
life
is
in
danger
and
it
is
thus
that
you
fear
to
abandon
me
gaston
you
betray
yourself
you
are
no
longer
the
gaston
of
former
days
you
met
me
with
a
constrained
joy
losing
me
yesterday
did
not
cause
you
intense
sorrow
there
are
more
important
prospects
in
your
mind
than
in
your
heart
there
is
something
in
you
pride
or
ambition
more
powerful
than
your
love
you
turn
pale
gaston
your
silence
breaks
my
heart
nothing
nothing
helene
i
assure
you
is
it
surprising
that
i
am
troubled
to
find
you
here
alone
and
defenseless
and
not
know
how
to
protect
you
for
doubtless
this
is
a
man
of
power
in
bretagne
i
should
have
had
friends
and
two
hundred
peasants
to
defend
me
here
i
have
no
one
is
that
all
gaston
that
is
it
seems
to
me
more
than
enough
no
gaston
for
we
will
leave
this
house
instantly
gaston
turned
pale
helene
lowered
her
eyes
and
placing
her
hand
in
that
of
her
lover
before
these
people
who
watch
us
said
she
before
the
eyes
of
this
woman
we
will
go
away
together
gaston
eyes
lighted
up
with
joy
but
somber
thoughts
quickly
clouded
them
again
helene
watched
this
changing
expression
am
i
not
your
wife
gaston
said
she
is
not
my
honor
yours
let
us
go
but
where
to
place
you
said
gaston
gaston
replied
helene
i
know
nothing
i
can
do
nothing
i
am
ignorant
of
paris
of
the
world
i
only
know
myself
and
you
well
you
have
opened
my
eyes
i
distrust
all
except
your
fidelity
and
love
gaston
was
in
despair
six
months
previous
and
he
would
have
paid
with
his
life
the
generous
devotion
of
the
courageous
girl
helene
reflect
said
gaston
if
we
were
mistaken
and
this
man
be
really
your
father
gaston
do
you
forget
that
you
first
taught
me
to
distrust
him
oh
yes
helene
let
us
go
cried
gaston
where
are
we
to
go
asked
helene
but
you
need
not
reply
if
you
know
it
is
sufficient
helene
said
gaston
i
will
not
insult
you
by
swearing
to
respect
your
honor
the
offer
which
you
have
made
i
have
long
hesitated
to
make
rich
happy
sure
for
the
present
of
fortune
and
happiness
i
would
have
placed
all
at
your
feet
trusting
to
god
for
the
future
but
at
this
moment
i
must
tell
you
that
you
were
not
mistaken
from
day
to
day
from
this
day
to
the
next
there
is
a
chance
of
a
terrible
event
i
must
tell
you
now
helene
what
i
can
offer
you
if
i
succeed
a
high
and
powerful
position
but
if
i
fail
flight
exile
it
may
be
poverty
do
you
love
me
enough
helene
or
rather
do
you
love
your
honor
enough
to
brave
all
this
and
follow
me
i
am
ready
gaston
tell
me
to
follow
you
and
i
do
so
well
helene
your
confidence
shall
not
be
displaced
believe
me
i
will
take
you
to
a
person
who
will
protect
you
if
necessary
and
who
in
my
absence
will
replace
the
father
you
thought
to
find
but
whom
you
have
on
the
contrary
lost
a
second
time
who
is
this
person
gaston
this
is
not
distrust
added
helene
with
a
charming
smile
but
curiosity
some
one
who
can
refuse
me
nothing
helene
whose
days
are
dependent
on
mine
and
who
will
think
i
demand
small
payment
when
i
exact
your
peace
and
security
still
mysterious
gaston
really
you
frighten
me
this
secret
is
the
last
helene
from
this
moment
my
whole
life
will
be
open
to
you
i
thank
you
gaston
and
now
i
am
at
your
orders
helene
let
us
go
then
helene
took
the
chevalier
arm
and
crossed
the
where
sat
madame
desroches
pale
with
anger
and
scrawling
a
letter
whose
destination
we
can
guess
mon
dieu
mademoiselle
where
are
you
going
what
are
you
doing
i
am
going
away
from
a
house
where
my
honor
is
threatened
what
cried
the
old
lady
springing
to
her
feet
you
are
going
away
with
your
lover
you
are
mistaken
madame
replied
helene
in
an
accent
of
dignity
it
is
with
my
husband
madame
desroches
terrified
let
her
hands
fall
by
her
side
powerless
you
shall
not
go
mademoiselle
even
if
i
am
forced
to
use
violence
try
madame
said
helene
in
the
queenly
tone
which
seemed
natural
to
her
hola
picard
coutourier
blanchet
the
servants
appeared
the
first
who
stops
me
i
kill
said
gaston
quietly
as
he
drew
his
sword
what
a
will
cried
madame
desroches
ah
mesdemoiselles
de
chartres
and
de
valois
i
recognize
you
there
the
two
young
people
heard
this
exclamation
but
did
not
understand
it
we
are
going
madame
said
helene
do
not
forget
to
repeat
word
by
word
what
i
told
you
and
hanging
on
gaston
arm
flushed
with
pleasure
and
pride
brave
as
an
ancient
amazon
the
young
girl
ordered
that
the
door
should
be
opened
for
her
the
swiss
did
not
dare
to
resist
gaston
took
helene
by
the
hand
summoned
the
carriage
in
which
he
had
come
and
seeing
that
he
was
to
be
followed
he
stepped
toward
the
assailants
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
two
steps
further
and
i
tell
this
history
aloud
and
place
myself
and
mademoiselle
under
the
safeguard
of
the
public
honor
madame
desroches
believed
that
gaston
knew
the
mystery
and
would
declare
it
she
therefore
thought
best
to
retire
quickly
followed
by
the
servants
the
intelligent
driver
started
at
a
gallop
chapter
xxi
what
passed
in
the
rue
du
bac
while
waiting
for
gaston
what
monseigneur
you
here
cried
dubois
entering
the
room
of
the
house
in
the
rue
du
bac
and
finding
the
regent
seated
in
the
same
place
as
on
the
previous
day
yes
is
there
anything
wonderful
in
that
have
i
not
an
appointment
at
noon
with
the
chevalier
but
i
thought
the
order
you
signed
would
have
put
an
end
to
these
conferences
you
were
mistaken
dubois
i
wish
to
have
another
interview
with
this
young
man
i
shall
make
one
more
effort
to
induce
him
to
renounce
his
plans
and
if
he
should
do
so
then
all
will
be
at
an
end
there
will
be
no
conspiracy
there
will
have
been
no
conspirators
i
can
not
punish
intentions
with
any
other
i
should
not
allow
this
but
with
him
i
say
as
you
please
you
think
he
will
remain
firm
oh
i
am
quite
easy
but
when
he
has
decidedly
refused
when
you
are
quite
convinced
that
he
persists
in
his
intention
of
assassinating
you
then
you
will
give
him
over
to
me
will
you
not
yes
but
not
here
why
not
here
better
to
arrest
him
at
his
hotel
there
at
the
muids
with
tapin
and
people
impossible
monsieur
bourguignon
affair
is
still
in
everybody
mouth
in
that
quarter
i
am
not
sure
that
they
even
quite
believe
in
the
attack
of
apoplexy
since
tapin
now
gives
strict
measure
it
will
be
much
better
to
arrest
him
as
he
leaves
here
monseigneur
the
house
is
quiet
four
men
could
easily
do
it
and
they
are
already
here
i
will
move
them
as
you
insist
on
seeing
him
and
instead
of
arresting
him
as
he
enters
it
must
be
done
as
he
leaves
at
the
door
a
carriage
shall
be
ready
to
take
him
to
the
bastille
so
that
even
the
coachman
who
brings
him
here
shall
not
know
what
has
become
of
him
no
one
but
monsieur
de
launay
shall
know
and
i
will
answer
for
his
discretion
do
as
you
please
that
is
my
usual
custom
rascal
that
you
are
but
i
think
monseigneur
reaps
the
benefit
of
the
rascality
oh
i
know
you
are
always
right
but
the
others
what
others
the
bretons
pontcalec
du
couëdic
talhouet
and
montlouis
oh
the
unfortunates
you
know
their
names
and
how
do
you
think
i
have
passed
my
time
at
the
hotel
muids
they
will
know
of
their
accomplice
arrest
how
having
no
letter
from
paris
they
will
fear
that
something
is
wrong
bah
is
not
captain
la
jonquiere
there
to
reassure
them
true
but
they
must
know
the
writing
not
bad
monseigneur
you
are
improving
but
you
take
useless
precautions
as
racine
says
at
this
moment
probably
they
are
arrested
and
who
dispatched
the
order
pardieu
i
am
not
your
minister
for
nothing
besides
you
signed
it
i
are
you
mad
assuredly
these
men
are
not
less
guilty
than
the
chevalier
and
in
authorizing
me
to
arrest
one
you
authorized
me
to
arrest
all
and
when
did
the
bearer
of
this
order
leave
dubois
took
out
his
watch
just
three
hours
ago
thus
it
was
a
poetical
license
when
i
said
they
were
all
arrested
they
will
not
be
till
morning
bretagne
will
be
aroused
dubois
bah
i
have
taken
measures
the
breton
tribunals
will
not
condemn
their
compatriots
that
case
is
foreseen
and
if
they
should
be
condemned
none
will
be
found
to
execute
them
it
will
be
a
second
edition
of
the
affair
at
chalais
remember
it
was
at
nantes
that
took
place
dubois
i
tell
you
bretons
are
unaccommodating
this
is
a
point
to
settle
with
the
commissioners
of
whom
this
is
a
list
i
will
send
three
or
four
executioners
from
paris
men
accustomed
to
noble
deeds
who
have
preserved
the
traditions
of
the
cardinal
de
richelieu
good
god
cried
the
regent
bloodshed
under
my
reign
i
do
not
like
it
as
to
count
horn
he
was
a
thief
and
duchaffour
a
wretch
but
i
am
tender
dubois
no
monseigneur
you
are
not
tender
you
are
uncertain
and
weak
i
told
you
so
when
you
were
my
scholar
i
tell
you
so
again
now
that
you
are
my
master
when
you
were
christened
your
godmothers
the
fairies
gave
you
every
gift
of
nature
strength
beauty
courage
and
mind
only
one
whom
they
did
not
invite
because
she
was
old
and
they
probably
foresaw
your
aversion
to
old
women
arrived
the
last
and
gave
you
weakness
that
spoiled
all
and
who
told
you
this
pretty
tale
perrault
or
st
simon
the
princess
palatine
your
mother
the
regent
laughed
and
whom
shall
we
choose
for
the
commission
asked
he
oh
monseigneur
people
of
mind
and
resolution
be
sure
not
provincials
not
very
sensitive
to
family
scenes
men
old
in
the
dust
of
tribunals
whom
the
breton
men
will
not
frighten
with
their
fierce
eyes
nor
the
breton
women
seduce
with
their
beautiful
languid
ones
the
regent
made
no
reply
after
all
continued
dubois
these
people
may
not
be
as
guilty
as
we
suppose
what
they
have
plotted
let
us
recapitulate
bah
mere
trifles
to
bring
back
the
spaniards
into
france
what
is
that
to
call
philip
the
fifth
king
the
renouncer
of
his
country
to
break
all
the
laws
of
the
state
these
good
bretons
dubois
i
know
the
national
law
as
well
as
you
then
monseigneur
if
you
speak
truly
you
have
only
to
approve
the
nomination
of
the
commissioners
i
have
chosen
how
many
are
there
twelve
their
names
dubois
gave
in
the
list
ah
you
were
right
a
happy
choice
but
who
is
to
preside
over
this
amiable
assembly
guess
monseigneur
take
care
you
must
have
an
honest
man
at
the
head
of
these
ravagers
i
have
one
who
is
it
an
ambassador
cellamare
perhaps
ma
foi
i
think
if
you
would
let
him
come
out
of
blois
he
would
not
refuse
you
even
the
heads
of
his
accomplices
let
him
stop
at
blois
who
is
to
preside
the
ambassador
from
holland
from
the
great
king
dubois
i
do
not
generally
compliment
you
but
this
time
you
have
done
wonders
you
understand
monseigneur
he
knows
that
these
people
wish
to
make
a
republic
and
he
who
is
brought
up
to
know
none
but
sultans
and
who
has
a
horror
of
holland
through
the
horror
of
louis
xiv
for
republics
has
accepted
with
a
good
grace
we
shall
have
argram
for
prosecutor
cayet
shall
be
our
secretary
we
go
to
work
quickly
and
well
monseigneur
for
time
presses
but
shall
we
at
least
have
quiet
afterward
i
believe
so
we
may
sleep
all
day
and
all
night
that
is
to
say
when
we
have
finished
the
war
in
spain
oh
cried
the
regent
why
did
i
strive
for
the
regency
i
should
laugh
to
see
de
maine
freeing
himself
with
his
jesuits
and
his
spaniards
madame
de
maintenon
and
her
politics
with
villeroy
and
villars
would
drive
away
the
spleen
and
hubert
says
it
is
good
to
laugh
once
a
day
apropos
of
madame
de
maintenon
replied
dubois
you
know
monseigneur
that
she
is
very
ill
and
that
she
can
not
live
a
fortnight
bah
since
the
imprisonment
of
madame
de
maine
and
the
exile
of
her
husband
she
says
that
decidedly
louis
xiv
is
dead
and
that
she
goes
weeping
to
rejoin
him
which
does
not
trouble
you
eh
oh
i
confess
that
i
hate
her
cordially
it
was
she
who
made
the
king
open
his
eyes
so
wide
when
i
asked
for
the
red
hat
at
your
marriage
and
corbleu
it
was
not
an
easy
thing
to
arrange
monseigneur
as
you
know
if
you
had
not
been
there
to
redress
my
wrongs
she
would
have
spoiled
my
career
if
i
could
but
have
crammed
her
de
maine
into
this
bretagne
affair
but
it
was
impossible
the
poor
man
is
half
dead
with
fear
so
that
he
says
to
every
one
he
meets
you
know
there
has
been
a
conspiracy
against
the
government
of
the
king
and
against
the
person
of
the
regent
it
is
a
disgrace
to
france
ah
if
all
men
were
only
like
me
no
one
would
conspire
that
is
certain
said
the
regent
he
has
disowned
his
wife
added
dubois
laughing
and
she
has
disowned
her
husband
said
the
regent
laughing
also
i
should
not
advise
you
to
imprison
them
together
they
would
fight
therefore
i
have
placed
one
at
doulens
and
the
other
at
dijon
from
whence
they
bite
by
post
let
us
put
all
that
aside
dubois
ah
monseigneur
you
have
i
see
sworn
the
loss
of
the
blood
of
louis
xiv
you
are
a
true
executioner
this
audacious
joke
proved
how
sure
dubois
felt
of
his
ascendency
over
the
prince
the
regent
signed
the
order
naming
the
tribunal
and
dubois
went
out
to
prepare
for
gaston
arrest
gaston
on
his
return
to
the
muids
found
the
same
carriage
and
the
same
guide
awaiting
him
that
had
before
conducted
him
to
the
rue
du
bac
gaston
who
did
not
wish
helene
to
alight
asked
if
he
could
continue
his
route
in
the
hired
carriage
in
which
he
had
just
arrived
the
man
replied
that
he
saw
no
objection
and
mounted
on
the
box
by
the
driver
to
whom
he
told
the
address
during
the
drive
gaston
instead
of
displaying
the
courage
which
helene
had
expected
was
sad
and
yet
gave
no
explanation
of
his
sadness
as
they
entered
the
rue
du
bac
helene
in
despair
at
finding
so
little
force
of
character
in
him
on
whom
she
leaned
for
protection
said
gaston
you
frighten
me
helene
you
shall
see
before
long
if
i
am
acting
for
your
good
or
not
the
carriage
stopped
helene
there
is
one
in
this
house
who
will
stand
in
the
place
of
a
father
to
you
let
me
go
first
and
i
announce
you
ah
cried
helene
trembling
she
knew
not
why
and
you
are
going
to
leave
me
here
alone
you
have
nothing
to
fear
helene
besides
in
a
few
minutes
i
will
return
and
fetch
you
the
young
girl
held
out
her
hand
which
gaston
pressed
to
his
lips
the
door
opened
the
carriage
drove
into
the
courtyard
where
gaston
felt
that
helene
ran
no
danger
the
man
who
had
come
to
the
hotel
to
fetch
him
opened
the
carriage
door
gaston
again
pressed
helene
hand
alighted
ascended
the
steps
and
entered
the
corridor
when
his
guide
left
him
as
before
gaston
knowing
that
helene
waited
his
return
at
once
tapped
at
the
door
of
the
room
enter
said
the
voice
of
the
false
spaniard
gaston
knew
the
voice
entered
and
with
a
calm
face
approached
the
duc
you
are
punctual
monsieur
said
the
latter
we
named
noon
and
it
is
now
striking
i
am
pressed
for
time
monseigneur
my
undertaking
weighs
on
me
i
fear
to
feel
remorse
that
astonishes
and
alarms
you
does
it
not
monseigneur
but
reassure
yourself
the
remorse
of
a
man
such
as
i
am
troubles
no
one
but
himself
in
truth
monsieur
cried
the
regent
with
a
feeling
of
joy
he
could
not
quite
conceal
i
think
you
are
drawing
back
not
so
monseigneur
since
fate
chose
me
to
strike
the
prince
i
have
gone
steadily
forward
and
shall
do
so
till
my
mission
is
accomplished
monsieur
i
thought
i
detected
some
hesitation
in
your
words
and
words
are
of
weight
in
certain
mouths
and
under
certain
circumstances
monsieur
in
bretagne
we
speak
as
we
feel
but
we
also
do
as
we
promise
then
you
are
resolved
more
than
ever
because
you
see
replied
the
regent
there
is
still
time
the
evil
is
not
yet
done
the
evil
you
call
it
monseigneur
said
gaston
what
shall
i
call
it
then
it
is
thus
that
i
meant
it
replied
the
regent
the
evil
is
for
you
since
you
feel
remorse
it
is
not
generous
monseigneur
to
dwell
on
a
confidence
which
i
should
not
have
made
to
any
person
of
less
merit
than
yourself
and
it
is
because
i
appreciate
your
worth
monsieur
that
i
tell
you
there
is
yet
time
to
draw
back
that
i
ask
if
you
have
reflected
if
you
repent
having
mixed
yourself
with
all
these
the
duke
hesitated
these
audacious
enterprises
fear
nothing
from
me
i
will
protect
you
even
if
you
desert
us
i
have
seen
you
but
once
but
i
think
i
judge
of
you
as
you
deserve
men
of
worth
are
so
rare
that
the
regrets
will
be
for
us
such
kindness
overwhelms
me
monseigneur
said
gaston
who
in
spite
of
his
courage
felt
some
indecision
my
prince
i
do
not
hesitate
but
my
reflections
are
those
of
a
duelist
who
goes
to
the
ground
determined
to
kill
his
enemy
yet
deploring
the
necessity
which
forces
him
to
rob
a
man
of
life
but
here
the
interest
is
so
great
so
superior
to
the
weaknesses
of
our
nature
that
i
will
be
true
to
my
friendship
if
not
my
sympathies
and
will
conduct
myself
so
that
you
shall
esteem
in
me
even
the
momentary
weakness
which
for
a
second
held
back
my
arm
well
said
the
regent
how
shall
you
proceed
i
shall
wait
till
i
meet
him
face
to
face
and
then
i
shall
not
use
an
arquebuse
as
paltrot
did
nor
a
pistol
as
vitry
did
i
shall
say
you
are
the
curse
of
france
i
sacrifice
you
to
her
salvation
and
i
shall
stab
him
with
my
poniard
as
ravaillac
did
said
the
duke
with
a
serenity
which
made
gaston
shudder
it
is
well
gaston
did
not
reply
this
plan
appears
to
me
the
most
secure
and
i
approve
of
it
but
i
must
ask
you
one
other
question
suppose
you
should
be
taken
and
interrogated
your
excellency
knows
what
men
do
in
such
cases
they
die
but
do
not
answer
and
since
you
have
quoted
ravaillac
i
think
if
my
memory
serves
me
that
was
what
he
did
and
yet
ravaillac
was
not
a
gentleman
gaston
pride
did
not
displease
the
regent
who
had
a
young
heart
and
a
chivalric
mind
besides
accustomed
to
and
courtiers
gaston
vigorous
and
simple
nature
was
a
novelty
to
him
and
we
know
how
the
regent
loved
a
novelty
i
may
then
reckon
said
he
that
you
are
immovable
gaston
looked
surprised
that
the
duke
should
repeat
this
question
yes
said
the
regent
i
see
you
are
decided
absolutely
and
wait
your
last
instructions
how
instructions
certainly
i
have
placed
myself
body
and
soul
at
your
disposal
the
duke
rose
well
said
he
you
must
go
out
by
that
door
and
cross
the
garden
which
surrounds
the
house
in
a
carriage
which
awaits
you
at
the
bottom
you
will
find
my
secretary
who
will
give
you
a
pass
for
an
audience
with
the
regent
besides
that
you
will
have
the
warranty
of
my
word
that
is
all
i
have
to
ask
on
that
point
monseigneur
have
you
anything
else
to
say
yes
before
i
take
leave
of
you
whom
i
may
never
see
again
in
this
world
i
have
a
boon
to
ask
speak
monsieur
i
listen
monsieur
said
gaston
do
not
wonder
if
i
hesitate
a
moment
for
this
is
no
personal
favor
and
no
ordinary
service
gaston
de
chanlay
needs
but
a
dagger
and
here
it
is
but
in
sacrificing
his
body
he
would
not
lose
his
soul
mine
monseigneur
belongs
first
to
god
and
then
to
a
young
girl
whom
i
love
to
idolatry
sad
love
is
it
not
which
has
bloomed
so
near
a
tomb
to
abandon
this
pure
and
tender
girl
would
be
to
tempt
god
in
a
most
rash
manner
for
i
see
that
sometimes
he
tries
us
cruelly
and
lets
even
his
angels
suffer
i
love
then
an
adorable
woman
whom
my
affection
has
supported
and
protected
against
infamous
schemes
when
i
am
dead
or
banished
what
will
become
of
her
heads
fall
monseigneur
they
are
those
of
simple
gentlemen
but
you
are
a
powerful
adversary
and
supported
by
a
powerful
king
can
conquer
evil
fortune
i
wish
to
place
in
your
hands
the
treasure
of
my
soul
you
will
bestow
on
her
all
the
protection
which
as
an
accomplice
as
an
associate
you
owe
to
me
monsieur
i
promise
you
replied
the
regent
deeply
moved
that
is
not
all
monseigneur
misfortune
may
overtake
me
and
find
me
not
able
to
bestow
my
person
upon
her
i
would
yet
leave
her
my
name
if
i
die
she
has
no
fortune
for
she
is
an
orphan
on
leaving
nantes
i
made
a
will
wherein
i
left
her
everything
i
possessed
monseigneur
if
i
die
let
her
be
a
widow
is
it
possible
who
opposes
it
no
one
but
i
may
be
arrested
this
evening
on
putting
my
foot
outside
this
house
the
regent
started
at
this
strange
presentiment
suppose
i
am
taken
to
the
bastille
could
you
obtain
for
me
permission
to
marry
her
before
my
execution
i
am
sure
of
it
you
will
use
every
means
to
obtain
this
favor
for
me
swear
it
to
me
monseigneur
that
i
may
bless
your
name
and
that
even
under
torture
nothing
may
escape
but
a
thanksgiving
when
i
think
of
you
on
my
honor
monsieur
i
promise
you
that
this
young
girl
shall
be
sacred
to
me
she
shall
inherit
in
my
heart
all
the
affection
which
i
involuntarily
feel
for
you
monseigneur
one
word
more
speak
monsieur
i
listen
with
the
deepest
sympathy
this
young
girl
knows
nothing
of
my
project
she
does
not
know
what
has
brought
me
to
paris
nor
the
catastrophe
which
threatens
us
for
i
have
not
had
the
courage
to
tell
her
you
will
tell
it
to
her
monseigneur
prepare
her
for
the
event
i
shall
never
see
her
again
but
to
become
her
husband
if
i
were
to
see
her
again
at
the
moment
of
striking
the
blow
which
separates
me
from
her
my
hand
might
tremble
and
this
must
not
be
on
my
word
of
honor
monsieur
said
the
regent
softened
beyond
all
expression
i
repeat
not
only
shall
this
young
girl
be
sacred
to
me
but
i
will
do
all
you
wish
for
her
she
shall
reap
the
fruits
of
the
respect
and
affection
with
which
you
have
inspired
me
now
said
gaston
i
am
strong
and
where
is
this
young
girl
below
in
the
carriage
which
brought
me
let
me
retire
monseigneur
and
only
tell
me
where
she
will
be
placed
here
monsieur
this
house
which
is
not
inhabited
and
which
is
very
suitable
for
a
young
girl
shall
be
hers
monseigneur
your
hand
the
regent
held
out
his
hand
but
hearing
a
little
dry
cough
he
understood
that
dubois
was
becoming
impatient
and
he
indicated
to
gaston
that
the
audience
was
over
once
more
monseigneur
watch
over
this
young
girl
she
is
beautiful
amiable
and
proud
one
of
those
noble
natures
which
we
meet
but
seldom
adieu
monseigneur
i
go
to
find
your
secretary
and
must
i
tell
her
that
you
are
about
to
take
a
man
life
asked
the
regent
making
one
more
effort
to
restrain
gaston
yes
monseigneur
said
the
chevalier
but
you
will
add
that
i
do
it
to
save
france
go
then
monsieur
said
the
duke
opening
a
door
which
led
into
the
garden
and
follow
the
directions
i
have
given
you
wish
me
good
fortune
monseigneur
the
madman
thought
the
regent
does
he
wish
me
to
pray
for
success
to
his
dagger
thrust
ma
foi
no
gaston
went
out
the
gravel
with
snow
creaked
under
his
feet
the
regent
watched
him
for
some
time
from
the
window
of
the
corridor
then
when
he
had
lost
sight
of
him
well
said
he
each
one
must
go
his
own
way
poor
fellow
and
he
returned
to
the
room
where
he
found
dubois
who
had
entered
by
another
door
and
was
waiting
for
him
dubois
face
wore
an
expression
of
malicious
satisfaction
which
did
not
escape
the
regent
who
watched
him
some
time
in
silence
as
if
trying
to
discover
what
was
passing
through
the
brain
of
this
second
mephistopheles
dubois
was
the
first
to
speak
well
monseigneur
you
are
rid
of
him
at
last
i
hope
yes
replied
the
duke
but
in
a
manner
which
greatly
displeases
me
i
do
not
like
playing
a
part
in
your
comedies
as
you
know
possibly
but
you
might
perhaps
do
wisely
in
giving
me
a
part
in
yours
how
so
they
would
be
more
successful
and
the
denouements
would
be
better
i
do
not
understand
explain
yourself
and
quickly
for
i
have
some
one
waiting
whom
i
must
receive
oh
certainly
monseigneur
receive
them
and
we
will
continue
our
conversation
later
the
denouement
of
this
comedy
has
already
taken
place
and
can
not
be
changed
and
with
these
words
dubois
bowed
with
the
mock
respect
which
he
generally
assumed
whenever
in
the
eternal
game
they
played
against
each
other
he
held
the
best
cards
nothing
made
the
regent
so
uneasy
as
this
simulated
respect
he
held
him
back
what
is
there
now
asked
he
what
have
you
discovered
that
you
are
a
skillful
dissimulator
peste
that
astonishes
you
no
it
troubles
me
a
few
steps
further
and
you
will
do
wonders
in
this
art
you
will
have
no
further
need
of
me
you
will
have
to
send
me
away
to
educate
your
son
whom
it
must
be
confessed
requires
a
master
like
myself
speak
quickly
certainly
monseigneur
it
is
not
now
however
a
question
of
your
son
but
of
your
daughter
of
which
daughter
ah
true
there
are
so
many
first
the
abbess
of
chelles
then
madame
de
berry
then
mademoiselle
de
valois
then
the
others
too
young
for
the
world
and
therefore
for
me
to
speak
of
then
lastly
the
charming
bretagne
flower
the
wild
blossom
which
was
to
be
kept
away
from
dubois
poisoning
breath
for
fear
it
should
wither
under
it
do
you
dare
to
say
i
was
wrong
not
so
monseigneur
you
have
done
wonders
not
wishing
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
infamous
dubois
for
which
i
commend
you
you
the
archbishop
of
cambray
being
dead
have
taken
in
his
place
the
good
the
worthy
the
pure
nocé
and
have
borrowed
his
house
ah
said
the
regent
you
know
that
and
what
a
house
pure
as
its
master
yes
monseigneur
you
are
full
of
prudence
and
wisdom
let
us
conceal
the
corruptions
of
the
world
from
this
innocent
child
let
us
remove
from
her
everything
that
can
destroy
her
primitive
naïveté
this
is
why
we
choose
this
dwelling
for
her
a
moral
sanctuary
where
the
priestesses
of
virtue
and
doubtless
always
under
pretext
of
their
ingenuousness
take
the
most
ingenuous
but
least
permitted
of
positions
nocé
told
me
that
all
was
proper
do
you
know
the
house
monseigneur
do
i
look
at
such
things
ah
no
your
sight
is
not
good
i
remember
dubois
for
furniture
your
daughter
will
have
strange
couches
magic
sofas
and
as
to
books
ah
that
is
the
climax
nocé
books
are
good
for
the
instruction
and
formation
of
youth
they
would
do
well
to
go
with
the
breviary
of
of
which
i
presented
you
a
copy
on
your
twelfth
birthday
yes
serpent
that
you
are
in
short
the
most
austere
prudery
prevails
over
the
dwelling
i
had
chosen
it
for
the
education
of
the
son
but
monseigneur
who
looks
at
things
differently
chose
it
for
the
daughter
ah
ca
dubois
said
the
regent
you
weary
me
i
am
just
at
the
end
monseigneur
no
doubt
your
daughter
was
well
pleased
with
the
residence
for
like
all
of
your
blood
she
is
very
intelligent
the
regent
shuddered
and
guessed
that
some
disagreeable
news
was
hidden
under
the
long
preamble
and
mocking
smile
of
dubois
however
monseigneur
see
what
the
spirit
of
contradiction
will
do
she
was
not
content
with
the
dwelling
you
chose
for
her
and
she
is
moving
what
do
you
mean
i
am
wrong
she
moved
my
daughter
gone
cried
the
regent
exactly
said
dubois
how
through
the
door
oh
she
is
not
one
of
those
young
ladies
who
go
through
the
windows
or
by
night
oh
she
is
of
your
blood
monseigneur
if
i
had
ever
doubted
it
i
should
be
convinced
now
and
madame
desroches
she
is
at
the
palais
royal
i
have
just
left
her
she
came
to
announce
it
to
your
highness
could
she
not
prevent
it
mademoiselle
commanded
she
should
have
made
the
servants
close
the
doors
they
did
not
know
that
she
was
my
daughter
and
had
no
reason
to
obey
her
madame
desroches
was
afraid
of
mademoiselle
anger
but
the
servants
were
afraid
of
the
sword
of
the
sword
are
you
drunk
dubois
oh
i
am
very
likely
to
get
drunk
on
chicory
water
no
monseigneur
if
i
am
drunk
it
is
with
admiration
of
your
highness
perspicacity
when
you
try
to
conduct
an
affair
all
alone
but
what
sword
do
you
mean
the
sword
which
mademoiselle
helene
disposes
of
and
which
belongs
to
a
charming
young
man
dubois
who
loves
her
dubois
you
will
drive
me
mad
and
who
followed
her
from
nantes
to
rambouillet
with
infinite
gallantry
monsieur
de
livry
ah
you
know
his
name
then
i
am
telling
you
nothing
new
monseigneur
dubois
i
am
overwhelmed
not
without
sufficient
cause
monseigneur
but
see
what
is
the
result
of
your
managing
your
own
affairs
while
you
have
at
the
same
time
to
look
after
those
of
france
but
where
is
she
ah
where
indeed
how
should
i
know
dubois
have
told
me
of
her
flight
i
look
to
you
to
discover
her
retreat
dubois
my
dear
dubois
for
god
sake
find
my
daughter
ah
monseigneur
you
are
exactly
like
the
father
in
moliere
and
i
am
like
scapin
good
scapin
my
dear
scapin
find
me
my
daughter
monseigneur
i
am
sorry
for
it
but
geroute
could
say
no
more
however
we
will
look
for
your
daughter
and
rescue
her
from
the
ravisher
well
find
her
dubois
and
ask
for
what
you
please
when
you
have
done
so
ah
that
is
something
like
speaking
the
regent
had
thrown
himself
back
in
an
armchair
and
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hands
dubois
left
him
to
his
grief
congratulating
himself
that
this
affection
would
double
his
empire
over
the
duke
all
at
once
while
dubois
was
watching
him
with
a
malicious
smile
some
one
tapped
at
the
door
who
is
there
asked
dubois
monseigneur
said
an
usher
voice
at
the
door
there
is
in
the
carriage
which
brought
the
chevalier
a
young
woman
who
wishes
to
know
if
he
is
coming
down
soon
dubois
made
a
bound
toward
the
door
but
he
was
too
late
the
regent
to
whom
the
usher
words
had
recalled
the
solemn
promise
he
had
made
to
gaston
rose
at
once
where
are
you
going
monseigneur
asked
dubois
to
receive
this
young
girl
that
is
my
affair
not
yours
you
forget
that
you
abandoned
this
conspiracy
to
me
i
gave
up
the
chevalier
to
you
but
i
promised
him
to
be
a
father
to
this
girl
whom
he
loves
i
have
pledged
my
word
and
i
will
keep
it
since
through
me
she
loses
her
lover
i
must
at
least
console
her
i
undertake
it
said
dubois
trying
to
hide
his
paleness
and
agitation
under
one
of
his
own
peculiar
smiles
hold
your
tongue
and
remain
here
said
the
regent
let
me
at
least
speak
to
her
monseigneur
i
will
speak
to
her
myself
this
is
no
affair
of
yours
i
have
taken
it
upon
myself
have
given
my
word
as
a
gentleman
silence
and
remain
here
dubois
ground
his
teeth
but
when
the
regent
spoke
in
this
tone
he
knew
he
must
obey
he
leaned
against
the
and
waited
soon
the
rustling
of
a
silk
dress
was
heard
yes
madame
said
the
usher
this
way
here
she
is
said
the
duke
remember
one
thing
dubois
this
young
girl
is
in
no
way
responsible
for
her
lover
fault
consequently
understand
me
she
must
be
treated
with
the
greatest
respect
then
turning
to
the
door
enter
said
he
the
door
was
hastily
opened
the
young
girl
made
a
step
toward
the
regent
who
started
back
thunderstruck
my
daughter
murmured
he
endeavoring
to
regain
his
while
helene
after
looking
round
for
gaston
stopped
and
curtseyed
dubois
face
would
not
be
easy
to
depict
pardon
me
monseigneur
said
helene
perhaps
i
am
mistaken
i
am
seeking
a
friend
who
left
me
below
who
was
to
come
back
to
me
but
as
he
delayed
so
long
i
came
to
seek
for
him
i
was
brought
here
but
perhaps
the
usher
made
a
mistake
no
mademoiselle
said
the
duke
de
chanlay
has
just
left
me
and
i
expected
you
as
the
regent
spoke
the
young
girl
became
abstracted
and
seemed
as
though
taxing
her
memory
then
in
answer
to
her
own
thoughts
she
cried
mon
dieu
how
strange
what
is
the
matter
asked
the
regent
yes
that
it
is
explain
said
the
duke
i
do
not
understand
you
ah
monsieur
said
helene
trembling
it
is
strange
how
your
voice
resembles
that
of
another
person
of
your
acquaintance
asked
the
regent
of
a
person
in
whose
presence
i
have
been
but
once
but
whose
accents
live
in
my
heart
and
who
was
this
person
asked
the
regent
while
dubois
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
this
half
recognition
he
called
himself
my
father
replied
helene
i
congratulate
myself
upon
this
chance
mademoiselle
said
the
regent
for
this
similarity
in
my
voice
to
that
of
a
person
who
is
dear
to
you
may
give
greater
weight
to
my
words
you
know
that
monsieur
de
chanlay
has
chosen
me
for
your
protector
he
told
me
he
would
bring
me
to
some
one
who
would
protect
me
from
the
danger
what
danger
asked
the
regent
helene
looked
round
her
and
her
glance
rested
uneasily
on
dubois
and
there
was
no
mistaking
her
expression
dubois
face
inspired
her
with
as
much
distrust
as
the
regent
did
with
confidence
monseigneur
said
dubois
who
did
not
fail
to
notice
this
expression
in
an
undertone
to
the
regent
i
think
i
am
de
trop
here
and
had
better
retire
you
do
not
want
me
do
you
no
but
i
shall
presently
do
not
go
away
i
will
be
at
your
orders
this
conversation
was
too
low
for
helene
to
hear
besides
she
had
stepped
back
and
continued
watching
the
doors
in
the
hope
of
seeing
gaston
return
it
was
a
consolation
to
dubois
to
know
she
would
be
disappointed
when
dubois
was
gone
they
breathed
more
freely
seat
yourself
mademoiselle
said
the
duke
i
have
much
to
tell
you
monsieur
one
thing
before
all
is
the
chevalier
gaston
de
chanlay
in
any
danger
we
will
speak
of
him
directly
but
first
of
yourself
he
brought
you
to
me
as
a
protector
now
tell
me
against
whom
i
am
to
protect
you
all
that
has
happened
to
me
for
some
days
is
so
strange
that
i
do
not
know
whom
to
fear
or
whom
to
trust
if
gaston
were
there
yes
i
understand
if
he
authorized
you
to
tell
me
you
would
keep
nothing
back
but
if
i
can
prove
to
you
that
i
know
nearly
all
concerning
you
you
monsieur
yes
i
are
you
not
called
helene
de
chaverny
were
you
not
brought
up
in
the
augustine
convent
between
nantes
and
clisson
did
you
not
one
day
receive
an
order
to
leave
the
convent
from
a
mysterious
protector
who
watches
over
you
did
you
not
travel
with
one
of
the
sisters
to
whom
you
gave
a
hundred
louis
for
her
trouble
at
rambouillet
did
not
a
person
called
madame
desroches
await
you
did
she
not
announce
to
you
a
visit
from
your
father
the
same
evening
did
not
some
one
arrive
who
loved
you
and
who
thought
you
loved
him
yes
yes
monsieur
it
is
all
true
said
helene
astonished
that
a
stranger
should
thus
know
the
details
of
her
history
then
the
next
day
continued
the
regent
did
not
monsieur
de
chanlay
who
followed
you
under
the
name
of
de
livry
pay
you
a
visit
which
was
vainly
opposed
by
madame
desroches
you
are
right
monsieur
and
i
see
that
gaston
has
told
you
all
then
came
the
order
to
leave
for
paris
you
would
have
opposed
it
but
were
forced
to
obey
you
were
taken
to
a
house
in
the
faubourg
antoine
but
there
your
captivity
became
insupportable
you
are
mistaken
monsieur
it
was
not
the
captivity
but
the
prison
i
do
not
understand
you
did
not
gaston
tell
you
of
his
fears
which
i
laughed
at
at
first
but
shared
afterward
no
tell
me
what
did
you
fear
but
if
did
not
tell
you
how
shall
is
there
anything
one
can
not
tell
to
a
friend
did
he
not
tell
you
that
this
man
whom
i
at
first
believed
to
be
my
father
illustration
gaston
rose
hastily
and
met
with
a
law
page
believed
yes
i
swear
it
monsieur
hearing
his
voice
feeling
my
hand
pressed
by
his
i
had
at
first
no
doubt
and
it
almost
needed
evidence
to
bring
fear
instead
of
the
filial
love
with
which
he
at
first
inspired
me
i
do
not
understand
you
mademoiselle
how
could
you
fear
a
man
who
to
judge
by
what
you
tell
me
had
so
much
affection
for
you
you
do
not
understand
monsieur
as
you
say
under
a
frivolous
pretext
i
was
removed
from
rambouillet
to
paris
shut
in
a
house
in
the
faubourg
saint
antoine
which
spoke
more
clearly
to
my
eyes
than
gaston
fears
had
done
then
i
thought
myself
lost
and
that
this
feigned
tenderness
of
a
father
concealed
the
wiles
of
a
seducer
i
had
no
friend
but
gaston
i
wrote
to
him
he
came
then
said
the
regent
filled
with
joy
when
you
left
that
house
it
was
to
escape
those
wiles
not
to
follow
your
lover
oh
monsieur
if
i
had
believed
in
that
father
whom
i
had
seen
but
once
and
then
surrounded
by
mysteries
i
swear
to
you
that
nothing
would
have
led
me
from
the
path
of
duty
oh
dear
child
cried
the
duke
with
an
accent
which
made
helene
start
then
gaston
spoke
to
me
of
a
person
who
could
refuse
him
nothing
who
would
watch
over
me
and
be
a
father
to
me
he
brought
me
here
saying
he
would
return
to
me
i
waited
in
vain
for
more
than
an
hour
and
at
length
fearing
some
accident
had
happened
to
him
i
asked
for
you
the
regent
brow
became
clouded
thus
said
he
it
was
gaston
influence
that
turned
you
from
your
duty
his
fears
aroused
yours
yes
he
suspected
the
mystery
which
encircled
me
and
feared
that
it
concealed
some
fatal
project
but
he
must
have
given
you
some
proof
to
persuade
you
what
proof
was
needed
in
that
abominable
house
would
a
father
have
placed
his
daughter
in
such
a
habitation
yes
yes
murmured
the
regent
he
was
wrong
but
confess
that
without
the
chevalier
suggestions
you
in
the
innocence
of
your
soul
would
have
had
no
suspicion
no
said
helene
but
happily
gaston
watched
over
me
do
you
then
believe
that
all
gaston
said
to
you
was
true
asked
the
regent
we
easily
side
with
those
we
love
monsieur
and
you
love
the
chevalier
yes
for
the
last
two
years
monsieur
but
how
could
he
see
you
in
the
convent
by
night
with
the
aid
of
a
boat
and
did
he
see
you
often
every
week
then
you
love
him
yes
monsieur
but
how
could
you
dispose
of
your
heart
knowing
that
you
were
not
your
own
mistress
for
sixteen
years
i
had
heard
nothing
of
my
family
how
could
i
suppose
that
all
at
once
it
would
reveal
itself
or
rather
that
an
odious
maneuver
should
take
me
from
my
quiet
retreat
to
my
ruin
then
you
still
think
that
that
man
lied
when
he
called
himself
your
father
i
scarcely
know
what
to
think
and
my
mind
becomes
bewildered
in
contemplating
this
strange
reality
which
seems
so
like
a
dream
but
you
should
not
consult
your
mind
here
helene
said
the
regent
you
should
consult
your
heart
when
you
were
with
this
man
did
not
your
heart
speak
to
you
oh
said
helene
while
he
was
there
i
was
convinced
for
i
have
never
felt
emotion
such
as
i
felt
then
yes
replied
the
regent
bitterly
but
when
he
was
gone
this
emotion
disappeared
driven
away
by
stronger
influence
it
is
very
simple
this
man
was
only
your
father
gaston
was
your
lover
monsieur
said
helene
drawing
back
you
speak
strangely
pardon
me
replied
the
regent
in
a
sweet
voice
i
see
that
i
allowed
myself
to
be
carried
away
by
my
interest
but
what
surprises
me
more
than
all
mademoiselle
continued
he
is
that
being
beloved
as
you
are
by
gaston
you
could
not
induce
him
to
abandon
his
projects
his
projects
monsieur
what
do
you
mean
what
you
do
not
know
the
object
of
his
visit
to
paris
i
do
not
monsieur
when
i
told
him
with
tears
in
my
eyes
that
i
was
forced
to
leave
clisson
he
said
he
must
also
leave
nantes
when
i
told
him
that
i
was
coming
to
paris
he
answered
with
a
cry
of
joy
that
he
was
about
to
set
out
for
the
same
place
then
cried
the
regent
his
heart
freed
from
an
enormous
load
you
are
not
his
accomplice
his
accomplice
cried
helene
alarmed
ah
mon
dieu
what
does
this
mean
nothing
said
the
regent
nothing
oh
yes
monsieur
you
have
used
a
word
which
explains
all
i
wondered
what
made
so
great
a
change
in
gaston
why
for
the
last
year
whenever
i
spoke
of
our
future
his
brow
became
dark
why
with
so
sad
a
smile
he
said
to
me
no
one
is
sure
of
the
morrow
why
he
fell
into
such
reveries
as
though
some
misfortune
threatened
him
that
misfortune
you
have
shown
me
monsieur
gaston
saw
none
but
malcontents
there
montlouis
pontcalec
ah
gaston
is
conspiring
that
is
why
he
came
to
paris
then
you
knew
nothing
of
this
conspiracy
alas
monsieur
i
am
but
a
woman
and
doubtless
gaston
did
not
think
me
worthy
to
share
such
a
secret
so
much
the
better
cried
the
regent
and
now
my
child
listen
to
the
voice
of
a
friend
of
a
man
who
might
be
your
father
let
the
chevalier
go
on
the
path
he
has
chosen
since
you
have
still
the
power
to
go
no
further
who
i
monsieur
cried
helene
i
abandon
him
at
a
moment
when
you
yourself
tell
me
that
a
danger
threatens
him
that
i
had
not
known
oh
no
no
monsieur
we
two
are
alone
in
the
world
we
have
but
each
other
gaston
has
no
parents
i
have
none
either
or
if
i
have
they
have
been
separated
from
me
for
sixteen
years
and
are
accustomed
to
my
absence
we
may
then
lose
ourselves
together
without
costing
any
one
a
tear
oh
i
deceived
you
monsieur
and
whatever
crime
he
has
committed
or
may
commit
i
am
his
accomplice
ah
murmured
the
regent
in
a
choking
voice
my
last
hope
fails
me
she
loves
him
helene
turned
with
astonishment
toward
the
stranger
who
took
so
lively
an
interest
in
her
sorrow
the
regent
composed
himself
but
continued
he
did
you
not
almost
renounce
him
did
you
not
tell
him
the
day
you
separated
that
you
could
not
dispose
of
your
heart
and
person
yes
i
told
him
so
replied
the
young
girl
with
exaltation
because
at
that
time
i
believed
him
happy
because
i
did
not
know
that
his
liberty
perhaps
his
life
were
compromised
then
my
heart
would
have
suffered
but
my
conscience
would
have
remained
tranquil
it
was
a
grief
to
bear
not
a
remorse
to
combat
but
since
i
know
him
threatened
unhappy
i
feel
that
his
life
is
mine
but
you
exaggerate
your
love
for
him
replied
the
regent
determined
to
ascertain
his
daughter
feelings
this
love
would
yield
to
absence
it
would
yield
to
nothing
monsieur
in
the
isolation
in
which
my
parents
left
me
this
love
has
become
my
only
hope
my
happiness
my
life
ah
monsieur
if
you
have
any
influence
with
him
and
you
must
have
since
he
confides
to
you
the
secrets
which
he
keeps
from
me
in
heaven
name
induce
him
to
renounce
these
projects
of
which
you
speak
tell
him
what
i
dare
not
tell
him
myself
that
i
love
him
beyond
all
expression
tell
him
that
his
fate
shall
be
mine
that
if
he
be
exiled
i
exile
myself
if
he
be
imprisoned
i
will
be
so
too
and
that
if
he
dies
i
die
tell
him
monsieur
and
add
add
that
you
saw
by
my
tears
and
by
my
despair
that
i
spoke
the
truth
unhappy
child
murmured
the
regent
indeed
helene
situation
was
a
pitiable
one
by
the
paleness
of
her
cheeks
it
was
evident
that
she
suffered
cruelly
while
she
spoke
her
tears
flowed
ceaselessly
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
every
word
came
from
her
heart
and
that
what
she
had
said
she
would
do
well
said
the
regent
i
promise
you
that
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
save
the
chevalier
helene
was
about
to
throw
herself
at
the
duke
feet
so
humbled
was
this
proud
spirit
by
the
thought
of
gaston
danger
but
the
regent
received
her
in
his
arms
helene
trembled
through
her
whole
frame
there
was
something
in
the
contact
with
this
man
which
filled
her
with
hope
and
joy
she
remained
leaning
on
his
arm
and
made
no
effort
to
raise
herself
mademoiselle
said
the
regent
watching
her
with
an
expression
which
would
certainty
have
betrayed
him
if
helene
had
raised
her
eyes
to
his
face
mademoiselle
the
most
pressing
affair
first
i
have
told
you
that
gaston
is
in
danger
but
not
in
immediate
danger
let
us
then
first
think
of
yourself
whose
position
is
both
false
and
precarious
you
are
intrusted
to
my
care
and
i
must
before
all
else
acquit
myself
worthily
of
this
charge
do
you
trust
me
mademoiselle
oh
yes
gaston
brought
me
to
you
always
gaston
sighed
the
regent
in
an
undertone
then
to
helene
he
said
you
will
reside
in
this
house
which
is
unknown
and
here
you
will
be
free
your
society
will
consist
of
excellent
books
and
my
presence
will
not
be
wanting
if
it
be
agreeable
to
you
helene
made
a
movement
as
if
to
speak
besides
continued
the
duke
it
will
give
you
an
opportunity
to
speak
of
the
chevalier
helene
blushed
and
the
regent
continued
the
church
of
the
neighboring
convent
will
be
open
to
you
and
should
you
have
the
slightest
fear
such
as
you
have
already
experienced
the
convent
itself
might
shelter
you
the
superior
is
a
friend
of
mine
ah
monsieur
said
helene
you
quite
reassure
me
i
accept
the
house
you
offer
me
and
your
great
kindness
to
gaston
and
myself
will
ever
render
your
presence
agreeable
to
me
the
regent
bowed
then
mademoiselle
said
he
consider
yourself
at
home
here
i
think
there
is
a
adjoining
this
room
the
arrangement
of
the
is
commodious
and
this
evening
i
will
send
you
two
nuns
from
the
convent
whom
doubtless
you
would
prefer
to
servants
to
wait
on
you
ah
yes
monsieur
then
continued
the
regent
with
hesitation
then
you
have
almost
renounced
your
father
ah
monsieur
do
you
not
understand
that
it
is
for
fear
he
should
not
be
my
father
however
replied
the
regent
nothing
proves
it
that
house
alone
is
certainly
an
argument
against
him
but
he
might
not
have
known
it
oh
said
helene
that
is
almost
impossible
however
if
he
took
any
further
steps
if
he
should
discover
your
retreat
and
claim
you
or
at
least
ask
to
see
you
monsieur
we
would
inform
gaston
and
learn
his
opinion
it
is
well
said
the
regent
with
a
smile
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
helene
and
then
moved
toward
the
door
monsieur
said
helene
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
do
you
wish
for
anything
asked
the
duke
returning
can
i
see
him
the
words
seemed
to
die
away
on
her
lips
as
she
pronounced
them
yes
said
the
duke
but
is
it
not
better
for
your
sake
to
do
so
as
little
as
possible
helene
lowered
her
eyes
besides
said
the
duke
he
has
gone
on
a
journey
and
may
not
be
back
for
some
days
and
shall
i
see
him
on
his
return
i
swear
it
to
you
ten
minutes
after
two
nuns
and
a
lay
sister
entered
and
installed
themselves
in
the
house
when
the
regent
quitted
his
daughter
he
asked
for
dubois
but
he
was
told
that
after
waiting
half
an
hour
dubois
had
returned
to
the
palais
royal
the
duke
on
entering
the
abbe
room
found
him
at
work
with
his
secretaries
a
portfolio
full
of
papers
was
on
the
table
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
said
dubois
on
seeing
the
duke
but
as
you
delayed
and
your
conference
was
likely
to
be
prolonged
greatly
i
took
the
liberty
of
transgressing
your
orders
and
returning
here
you
did
rightly
but
i
want
to
speak
to
you
to
me
yes
to
you
to
me
alone
alone
in
that
case
will
monseigneur
go
into
my
cabinet
or
into
your
own
room
let
us
go
into
your
cabinet
the
abbe
made
a
respectful
bow
and
opened
the
door
the
regent
passed
in
first
and
dubois
followed
when
he
had
replaced
the
portfolio
under
his
arm
these
papers
had
probably
been
got
together
in
expectation
of
this
visit
when
they
were
in
the
cabinet
the
duke
looked
round
him
the
place
is
safe
asked
he
pardieu
each
door
is
double
and
the
walls
are
two
feet
thick
the
regent
sat
down
and
fell
into
a
deep
reverie
i
am
waiting
monseigneur
said
dubois
in
a
few
minutes
abbe
said
the
regent
in
a
quick
decided
tone
as
of
a
man
determined
to
be
answered
is
the
chevalier
in
the
bastille
monseigneur
replied
dubois
he
must
have
been
there
about
half
an
hour
then
write
to
de
launay
i
desire
that
he
be
set
free
at
once
dubois
did
not
seem
surprised
he
made
no
reply
but
he
placed
the
portfolio
on
the
table
opened
it
took
out
some
papers
and
began
to
look
over
them
quietly
did
you
hear
me
asked
the
regent
after
a
moment
silence
i
did
monseigneur
obey
then
write
yourself
monseigneur
said
dubois
and
why
because
nothing
shall
induce
this
hand
to
sign
your
highness
ruin
said
dubois
more
words
said
the
regent
impatiently
not
words
but
facts
monseigneur
is
de
chanlay
a
conspirator
or
is
he
not
yes
certainly
but
my
daughter
loves
him
a
fine
reason
for
setting
him
at
liberty
it
may
not
be
a
reason
to
you
abbe
but
to
me
it
is
and
a
most
sacred
one
he
shall
leave
the
bastille
at
once
go
and
fetch
him
then
i
do
not
prevent
you
and
did
you
know
this
secret
which
that
de
livry
and
the
chevalier
were
the
same
yes
i
knew
it
what
then
you
wished
to
deceive
me
i
wished
to
save
you
from
the
sentimentality
in
which
you
are
lost
at
this
moment
the
regent
of
france
already
too
much
occupied
by
whims
and
pleasures
must
make
things
worse
by
adding
passion
to
the
list
and
what
a
passion
paternal
love
dangerous
love
an
ordinary
love
may
be
satisfied
and
then
dies
away
but
a
father
tenderness
is
insatiable
and
above
all
intolerable
it
will
cause
your
highness
to
commit
faults
which
i
shall
prevent
for
the
simple
reason
that
i
am
happy
enough
not
to
be
a
father
a
thing
on
which
i
congratulate
myself
daily
when
i
see
the
misfortunes
and
stupidity
of
those
who
are
and
what
matters
a
head
more
or
less
cried
the
regent
this
de
chanlay
will
not
kill
me
when
he
knows
it
was
i
who
liberated
him
no
neither
will
he
die
from
a
few
days
in
the
bastille
and
there
he
must
stay
and
i
tell
you
he
shall
leave
it
he
must
for
his
own
honor
said
dubois
as
though
the
regent
had
not
spoken
for
if
he
were
to
leave
the
bastille
as
you
wish
he
would
appear
to
his
accomplices
who
are
now
in
the
prison
at
nantes
and
whom
i
suppose
you
do
not
wish
to
liberate
also
as
a
traitor
and
spy
who
has
been
pardoned
for
the
information
he
has
given
the
regent
reflected
you
are
all
alike
pursued
dubois
you
kings
and
reigning
princes
a
reason
stupid
enough
like
all
reasons
of
honor
such
as
i
have
just
given
closes
your
mouth
but
you
will
never
understand
true
and
important
reasons
of
state
what
does
it
matter
to
me
or
to
france
that
mademoiselle
helene
de
chaverny
natural
daughter
of
the
regent
should
weep
for
her
lover
monsieur
gaston
de
chanlay
ten
thousand
wives
ten
thousand
mothers
ten
thousand
daughters
may
weep
in
one
year
for
their
sons
their
husbands
their
fathers
killed
in
your
highness
service
by
the
spaniard
who
threaten
you
who
takes
your
gentleness
for
weakness
and
who
becomes
emboldened
by
impunity
we
know
the
plot
let
us
do
it
justice
de
chanlay
chief
or
agent
of
this
plot
coming
to
paris
to
assassinate
you
do
not
deny
it
no
doubt
he
told
you
so
himself
is
the
lover
of
your
daughter
so
much
the
worse
it
is
a
misfortune
which
falls
upon
you
but
may
have
fallen
upon
you
before
and
will
again
i
knew
it
all
i
knew
that
he
was
beloved
i
knew
that
he
was
called
de
chanlay
and
not
de
livry
yes
i
dissimulated
but
it
was
to
punish
him
exemplarily
with
his
accomplices
because
it
must
be
understood
that
the
regent
head
is
not
one
of
those
targets
which
any
one
may
aim
at
through
excitement
or
ennui
and
go
away
unpunished
if
they
fail
dubois
dubois
i
shall
never
sacrifice
my
daughter
life
to
save
my
own
and
i
should
kill
her
in
executing
the
chevalier
therefore
no
prison
no
dungeon
let
us
spare
the
shadow
of
torture
to
him
whom
we
can
not
treat
with
entire
justice
let
us
pardon
completely
no
half
pardon
any
more
than
half
justice
ah
yes
pardon
pardon
there
it
is
at
last
are
you
not
tired
of
that
word
monseigneur
are
you
not
weary
of
harping
eternally
on
one
string
this
time
at
least
it
is
a
different
thing
for
it
is
not
generosity
i
call
heaven
to
witness
that
i
should
like
to
punish
this
man
who
is
more
beloved
as
a
lover
than
i
as
a
father
and
who
takes
from
me
my
last
and
only
daughter
but
in
spite
of
myself
i
stop
i
can
go
no
farther
chanlay
shall
be
set
free
chanlay
shall
be
set
free
yes
monseigneur
mon
dieu
who
opposes
it
only
it
must
be
later
some
days
hence
what
harm
shall
we
do
him
diable
he
will
not
die
of
a
week
in
the
bastille
you
shall
have
your
be
at
peace
but
do
act
so
that
our
poor
little
government
shall
not
be
too
much
ridiculed
remember
that
at
this
moment
the
affairs
of
the
others
are
being
looked
into
and
somewhat
roughly
too
well
these
others
have
also
mistresses
wives
mothers
do
you
busy
yourself
with
them
no
you
are
not
so
mad
think
then
of
the
ridicule
if
it
were
known
that
your
daughter
loved
the
man
who
was
to
stab
you
the
bastards
would
laugh
for
a
month
it
is
enough
to
revive
la
maintenon
who
is
dying
and
make
her
live
a
year
longer
have
patience
monseigneur
let
the
chevalier
eat
chicken
and
drink
wine
with
de
launay
pardieu
richelieu
does
very
well
there
he
is
loved
by
another
of
your
daughters
which
did
not
prevent
you
from
putting
him
in
the
bastille
but
said
the
regent
when
he
is
in
the
bastille
what
will
you
do
with
him
oh
he
only
serves
this
little
apprenticeship
to
make
him
your
but
seriously
monseigneur
do
you
think
of
raising
him
to
that
honor
oh
mon
dieu
at
this
moment
i
think
of
nothing
dubois
but
that
i
do
not
want
to
make
my
poor
helene
unhappy
and
yet
i
really
think
that
giving
him
to
her
as
a
husband
is
somewhat
derogatory
though
the
de
chanlays
are
a
good
family
do
you
know
them
monseigneur
parbleu
it
only
wanted
that
i
heard
the
name
long
ago
but
i
can
not
remember
on
what
occasion
we
shall
see
but
meanwhile
whatever
you
may
say
one
thing
i
have
decided
he
must
not
appear
as
a
traitor
and
remember
i
will
not
have
him
maltreated
in
that
case
he
is
well
off
with
de
launay
but
you
do
not
know
the
bastille
monseigneur
if
you
had
ever
tried
it
you
would
not
want
a
country
house
under
the
late
king
it
was
a
prison
oh
yes
i
grant
that
but
under
the
gentle
reign
of
philippe
it
is
a
house
of
pleasure
besides
at
this
moment
there
is
an
excellent
company
there
there
are
fetes
balls
vocal
concerts
they
drink
champagne
to
the
health
of
the
duc
de
maine
and
the
king
of
spain
it
is
you
who
pay
but
they
wish
aloud
that
you
may
die
and
your
race
become
extinct
pardieu
monsieur
de
chanlay
will
find
some
acquaintances
there
and
be
as
comfortable
as
a
fish
in
the
water
ah
pity
him
monseigneur
for
he
is
much
to
be
pitied
poor
fellow
yes
yes
cried
the
duke
delighted
and
after
the
revelations
in
bretagne
we
shall
see
dubois
laughed
the
revelations
in
bretagne
ah
pardieu
monseigneur
i
shall
be
anxious
to
know
what
you
will
learn
that
the
chevalier
did
not
tell
you
do
you
not
know
enough
yet
monseigneur
peste
if
it
were
me
i
should
know
too
much
but
it
is
not
you
abbe
alas
unfortunately
not
monseigneur
for
if
i
were
the
duc
and
regent
i
would
make
myself
cardinal
but
do
not
let
us
speak
of
that
it
will
come
in
time
i
hope
besides
i
have
found
a
way
of
managing
the
affair
which
troubles
you
i
distrust
you
abbe
i
warn
you
stay
monseigneur
you
only
love
the
chevalier
because
your
daughter
does
well
but
if
the
chevalier
repaid
her
fidelity
by
ingratitude
mon
dieu
the
young
woman
is
proud
monseigneur
she
herself
would
give
him
up
that
would
be
well
played
i
think
the
chevalier
cease
to
love
helene
impossible
she
is
an
angel
many
angels
have
gone
through
that
monseigneur
besides
the
bastille
does
and
undoes
many
things
and
one
soon
becomes
corrupted
there
especially
in
the
society
he
will
find
there
well
we
shall
see
but
not
a
step
without
my
consent
fear
nothing
monseigneur
will
you
now
examine
the
papers
from
nantes
yes
but
first
send
me
madame
desroches
certainly
dubois
rang
and
gave
the
regent
orders
ten
minutes
after
madame
desroches
entered
timidly
but
instead
of
the
storm
she
had
expected
she
received
a
smile
and
a
hundred
louis
i
do
not
understand
it
thought
she
after
all
the
young
girl
can
not
be
his
daughter
chapter
xxii
in
bretagne
our
readers
must
now
permit
us
to
look
backward
for
we
have
in
following
the
principal
persons
of
our
history
neglected
some
others
in
bretagne
who
deserve
some
notice
besides
if
we
do
not
represent
them
as
taking
an
active
part
in
this
tale
history
is
ready
with
her
inflexible
voice
to
contradict
us
we
must
therefore
for
the
present
submit
to
the
exigencies
of
history
bretagne
had
from
the
first
taken
an
active
part
in
the
movement
of
the
legitimated
bastards
this
province
which
had
given
pledges
of
fidelity
to
monarchical
principles
and
pushed
them
to
exaggeration
if
not
to
madness
since
it
preferred
the
adulterous
offspring
of
a
king
to
the
interests
of
a
kingdom
and
since
its
love
became
a
crime
by
calling
in
aid
of
the
pretensions
of
those
whom
it
recognized
as
its
princes
enemies
against
whom
louis
xiv
for
sixty
years
and
france
for
two
centuries
had
waged
a
war
of
extermination
we
have
seen
the
list
of
the
principal
names
which
constituted
this
revolt
the
regent
had
wittily
said
that
it
contained
the
head
and
tail
but
he
was
mistaken
it
was
the
head
and
body
the
head
was
the
council
of
the
legitimated
princes
the
king
of
spain
and
his
imbecile
agent
the
prince
of
cellamare
the
body
was
formed
by
those
brave
and
clever
men
who
were
now
in
the
bastille
but
the
tail
was
now
agitating
in
bretagne
among
a
people
unaccustomed
to
the
ways
of
a
court
and
it
was
a
tail
armed
with
stings
like
those
of
a
scorpion
and
which
was
the
most
to
be
feared
the
bretagne
chiefs
then
renewed
the
chevalier
de
rohan
under
louis
xiv
we
say
the
chevalier
de
rohan
because
to
every
conspiracy
must
be
given
the
name
of
a
chief
along
with
the
prince
who
was
a
conceited
and
commonplace
man
and
even
before
him
were
two
men
stronger
than
he
one
in
thought
and
the
other
in
execution
these
two
men
were
letreaumont
a
norman
gentleman
and
affinius
a
dutch
philosopher
letreaumont
wanted
money
he
was
the
arm
affinius
wanted
a
republic
he
was
the
soul
this
republic
moreover
he
wanted
inclosed
in
louis
xiv
kingdom
still
further
to
annoy
the
great
king
who
hated
republicans
even
at
a
distance
who
had
persecuted
and
destroyed
the
pensioner
of
holland
john
de
witt
more
cruel
in
this
than
the
prince
of
orange
who
in
declaring
himself
de
witt
enemy
revenged
personal
injuries
while
louis
xiv
had
received
nothing
but
friendship
and
devotion
from
this
great
man
now
affinius
wanted
a
republic
in
normandy
and
got
the
chevalier
de
rohan
named
protector
the
bretons
wished
to
revenge
themselves
for
certain
injuries
their
province
had
received
under
the
regency
and
they
decreed
it
a
republic
with
the
power
of
choosing
a
protector
even
were
he
a
spaniard
but
monsieur
de
maine
had
a
good
chance
this
is
what
passed
in
bretagne
the
bretons
lent
an
ear
to
the
first
overtures
of
the
spaniards
they
had
no
more
cause
for
discontent
than
other
provinces
but
to
them
it
seemed
a
capital
opportunity
for
war
and
they
had
no
other
aim
richelieu
had
ruled
them
severely
they
thought
to
emancipate
themselves
under
dubois
and
they
began
by
objecting
to
the
administrators
sent
by
the
regent
a
revolution
always
commences
by
a
riot
montesquieu
was
appointed
viceroy
to
hold
assemblies
to
hear
the
people
complaints
and
to
collect
their
money
the
people
complained
plentifully
but
would
not
pay
because
they
did
not
like
the
steward
this
appeared
a
bad
reason
to
montesquieu
who
was
a
man
of
the
old
régime
you
can
not
offer
these
complaints
to
his
majesty
said
he
without
appearing
to
rebel
pay
first
and
complain
afterward
the
king
will
listen
to
your
sorrows
but
not
to
your
antipathies
to
a
man
honored
by
his
choice
monsieur
de
montaran
of
whom
the
bretons
complained
gave
no
offense
but
in
being
intendant
of
the
province
any
other
would
have
been
as
much
disliked
and
they
persisted
in
their
refusal
to
pay
monsieur
le
marechal
said
their
deputies
your
language
might
suit
a
general
treating
with
a
conquered
place
but
can
not
be
accepted
by
free
and
privileged
men
we
are
neither
enemies
nor
soldiers
we
are
citizens
and
masters
at
home
in
compensation
of
a
service
which
we
ask
namely
that
monsieur
de
montaran
whom
we
dislike
should
be
removed
we
will
pay
the
tax
demanded
but
if
the
court
takes
to
itself
the
highest
prize
we
will
keep
our
money
and
bear
as
we
best
can
the
treasurer
who
displeases
us
monsieur
de
montesquieu
with
a
contemptuous
smile
turned
on
his
heel
the
deputies
did
the
same
and
both
retired
with
their
original
dignity
but
the
marshal
was
willing
to
wait
he
behaved
himself
as
an
able
diplomatist
and
thought
that
private
reunions
would
set
all
right
but
the
breton
nobles
were
proud
indignant
at
their
treatment
they
appeared
no
more
at
the
marshal
reception
and
he
from
contempt
changed
to
angry
and
foolish
resolves
this
was
what
the
spaniards
had
expected
montesquieu
corresponding
with
the
authorities
at
nantes
quimper
vannes
and
rennes
wrote
that
he
had
to
deal
with
rebels
and
mutineers
but
that
ten
thousand
of
his
soldiers
should
teach
the
bretons
politeness
the
states
were
held
again
from
the
nobility
to
the
people
in
bretagne
is
but
a
step
a
spark
lights
the
whole
the
citizens
declared
to
de
montesquieu
that
if
he
had
ten
thousand
men
bretagne
had
a
hundred
thousand
who
would
teach
his
soldiers
with
stones
forks
and
muskets
that
they
had
better
mind
their
own
business
and
that
only
the
marshal
assured
himself
of
the
truth
of
this
assertion
and
was
quiet
leaving
things
as
they
were
for
a
while
the
nobility
then
made
a
formal
and
moderate
complaint
but
dubois
and
the
council
of
the
regency
treated
it
as
a
hostile
manifesto
and
used
it
as
an
instrument
montaran
montesquieu
pontcalec
and
talhouet
were
the
men
really
fighting
among
themselves
pontcalec
a
man
of
mind
and
power
joined
the
malcontents
and
encouraged
the
growth
of
the
struggle
there
was
no
drawing
back
the
court
however
only
saw
the
revolt
and
did
not
suspect
the
spanish
affair
the
bretons
who
were
secretly
undermining
the
regency
cried
aloud
no
impost
no
montaran
to
draw
away
suspicion
from
their
plots
but
the
event
turned
out
against
them
the
regent
a
skillful
politician
guessed
the
plot
without
perceiving
it
he
thought
that
this
local
veil
hid
some
other
phantom
and
he
tore
off
the
veil
he
withdrew
montaran
and
then
the
conspirators
were
unmasked
all
the
others
were
content
and
quiet
they
alone
remained
in
arms
then
pontcalec
and
his
friends
formed
the
plot
we
are
acquainted
with
and
used
violent
means
to
attain
their
ends
spain
was
watching
alberoni
beaten
by
dubois
in
the
affair
of
cellamare
waited
his
revenge
and
all
the
treasures
prepared
for
the
plot
of
paris
were
now
sent
to
bretagne
but
it
was
late
he
did
not
believe
it
and
his
agents
deceived
him
he
thought
it
was
possible
to
recommence
the
war
but
then
france
made
war
on
spain
he
thought
it
possible
to
kill
the
regent
but
he
and
not
chanlay
should
do
what
no
one
would
then
recommend
to
the
most
cruel
enemy
of
france
alberoni
reckoned
on
the
arrival
of
a
spanish
vessel
full
of
arms
and
money
and
this
ship
did
not
arrive
he
waited
for
news
of
chanlay
it
was
la
jonquiere
who
wrote
and
what
a
la
jonquiere
one
evening
pontcalec
and
his
friends
had
met
in
a
little
room
near
the
old
castle
their
countenances
were
sad
and
irresolute
du
couëdic
announced
that
he
had
received
a
note
recommending
them
to
take
flight
i
have
a
similar
one
to
show
you
said
montlouis
it
was
slid
under
my
glass
at
table
and
my
wife
who
expected
nothing
was
frightened
i
neither
expect
nor
fear
anything
said
talhouet
the
province
is
calm
the
news
from
paris
is
good
every
day
the
regent
liberates
some
one
of
those
imprisoned
for
the
spanish
affair
and
i
gentlemen
said
pontcalec
must
tell
you
of
a
strange
communication
i
have
received
show
me
your
note
du
couëdic
and
you
yours
montlouis
perhaps
it
is
the
same
writing
and
is
a
snare
for
us
i
do
not
think
so
for
if
they
wish
us
to
leave
this
it
is
to
escape
some
danger
we
have
nothing
to
fear
for
our
reputation
for
that
is
not
at
stake
the
affairs
of
bretagne
are
known
to
the
world
your
brother
talhouet
and
your
cousin
have
fled
to
spain
solduc
rohan
sanbilly
the
counselor
have
all
disappeared
yet
their
flight
was
supposed
to
be
natural
and
from
some
simple
cause
of
discontent
i
confess
if
the
advice
be
repeated
i
shall
fly
we
have
nothing
to
fear
my
friends
said
pontcalec
our
affairs
were
never
more
prosperous
see
the
court
has
no
suspicion
or
we
should
have
been
molested
already
la
jonquiere
wrote
yesterday
he
announces
that
de
chanlay
is
starting
for
la
muette
where
the
regent
lives
as
a
private
gentleman
without
guards
without
fear
yet
you
are
uneasy
said
du
couëdic
i
confess
it
but
not
for
the
reason
you
suppose
what
is
it
then
a
personal
matter
of
your
own
yes
and
i
could
not
confide
it
to
more
devoted
friends
or
any
who
know
me
better
if
ever
i
were
molested
if
ever
i
had
the
alternative
of
remaining
or
of
flying
to
escape
a
danger
i
should
remain
do
you
know
why
no
speak
i
am
afraid
you
pontcalec
afraid
what
do
you
mean
by
these
words
after
those
you
have
just
uttered
mon
dieu
yes
my
friend
the
ocean
is
our
safeguard
we
could
find
safety
on
board
one
of
those
vessels
which
cruise
on
the
loire
from
paimboeuf
to
saint
nazaire
but
what
is
safety
to
you
is
certain
death
to
me
i
do
not
understand
you
said
talhouet
you
alarm
me
said
montlouis
listen
then
my
friends
said
pontcalec
and
he
began
in
the
midst
of
the
most
scrupulous
attention
the
following
recital
for
they
knew
that
if
pontcalec
were
afraid
there
must
be
a
good
cause
chapter
xxiii
the
sorceress
of
savernay
i
was
ten
years
old
and
i
lived
at
pontcalec
in
the
midst
of
woods
when
one
day
my
uncle
crysogon
my
father
and
i
resolved
to
have
a
rabbit
hunt
in
a
warren
at
five
or
six
miles
distance
found
seated
on
the
heath
a
woman
reading
so
few
of
our
peasants
could
read
that
we
were
surprised
we
stopped
and
looked
at
her
i
see
her
now
as
though
it
were
yesterday
though
it
is
nearly
twenty
years
ago
she
wore
the
dark
costume
of
our
breton
women
with
the
usual
white
and
she
was
seated
on
a
large
tuft
of
broom
in
blossom
which
she
had
been
cutting
my
father
was
mounted
on
a
beautiful
bay
horse
with
a
mane
my
uncle
on
a
gray
horse
young
and
ardent
and
i
rode
one
of
those
little
white
ponies
which
to
strength
and
activity
unite
the
docility
of
a
sheep
the
woman
looked
up
from
her
book
at
the
group
before
her
and
seeing
me
firm
in
my
stirrups
near
my
father
who
seemed
proud
of
me
she
rose
all
at
once
and
approaching
me
said
a
pity
do
you
mean
asked
my
father
means
that
i
do
not
like
that
white
pony
replied
the
woman
why
not
he
will
bring
misfortune
to
your
child
sirè
de
pontcalec
we
bretons
are
superstitious
you
know
so
that
even
my
father
who
you
know
montlouis
was
an
enlightened
as
well
as
a
brave
man
stopped
in
spite
of
my
uncle
crysogon
who
urged
us
to
proceed
and
trembling
at
the
idea
of
danger
to
me
he
added
the
pony
is
gentle
my
good
woman
and
clement
rides
well
for
his
age
i
have
often
ridden
the
little
animal
in
the
park
and
its
paces
are
perfect
do
not
know
anything
of
that
marquis
de
guer
replied
the
woman
the
little
white
horse
will
injure
your
son
clement
i
tell
you
how
can
you
know
this
see
it
replied
she
in
a
strange
voice
asked
my
father
my
father
turned
pale
and
i
was
afraid
but
my
uncle
crysogon
who
had
been
in
the
dutch
wars
and
had
become
somewhat
hardened
by
combating
the
huguenots
laughed
till
he
nearly
fell
from
his
horse
said
he
good
woman
certainly
is
in
league
with
the
rabbits
at
savernay
what
do
you
say
to
it
clement
would
you
like
to
go
home
and
lose
the
sport
i
replied
would
rather
go
on
with
you
look
pale
and
odd
are
you
afraid
am
not
afraid
said
i
i
lied
for
i
felt
a
certain
shudder
pass
through
me
which
was
very
like
fear
my
father
has
since
owned
to
me
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
words
which
caused
a
certain
false
shame
in
him
he
would
have
sent
me
home
or
given
my
horse
to
one
of
the
servants
but
what
an
example
for
a
boy
of
my
age
who
declared
himself
to
have
no
fear
and
what
a
subject
for
ridicule
to
my
uncle
i
continued
then
to
ride
my
pony
we
reached
the
warren
and
the
chase
commenced
while
it
lasted
the
pleasures
made
us
forget
the
prediction
but
the
chase
over
and
having
started
on
our
road
home
clement
said
my
uncle
on
your
pony
you
are
a
brave
boy
my
father
and
i
both
laughed
we
were
then
crossing
a
plain
as
flat
and
even
as
this
room
no
obstacles
in
the
way
nothing
that
could
frighten
a
horse
yet
at
that
moment
my
pony
gave
a
bound
which
shook
me
from
my
seat
then
he
reared
violently
and
threw
me
off
my
uncle
laughed
but
my
father
became
as
pale
as
death
i
did
not
move
and
my
father
leaped
from
his
horse
and
came
to
me
and
found
that
my
leg
was
broken
to
describe
my
father
grief
and
the
cries
of
the
grooms
would
be
impossible
but
my
uncle
despair
was
indescribable
kneeling
by
my
side
removing
my
clothes
with
a
trembling
hand
covering
me
with
tears
and
caresses
his
every
word
was
a
fervent
prayer
my
father
was
obliged
to
console
him
but
to
all
his
consolations
and
caresses
he
answered
not
they
sent
for
the
first
surgeon
at
nantes
who
pronounced
me
in
great
danger
my
uncle
begged
my
mother
pardon
all
day
long
and
we
remarked
that
during
my
illness
he
had
quite
changed
his
mode
of
life
instead
of
drinking
and
hunting
with
the
officers
instead
of
going
on
fishing
expeditions
of
which
he
was
so
fond
he
never
left
my
pillow
the
fever
lasted
six
weeks
and
the
illness
nearly
four
months
but
i
was
saved
and
retained
no
trace
of
the
accident
when
i
went
out
for
the
first
time
my
uncle
gave
me
his
arm
but
when
the
walk
was
over
he
took
leave
of
us
with
tears
in
his
eyes
are
you
going
crysogon
asked
my
father
in
astonishment
made
a
vow
replied
the
good
man
if
our
child
recovered
i
would
turn
carthusian
and
i
go
to
fulfill
it
this
was
a
new
grief
my
father
and
my
mother
shed
tears
i
hung
on
my
uncle
neck
and
begged
him
not
to
leave
us
but
the
viscount
was
a
man
who
never
broke
a
promise
or
a
resolution
our
tears
and
prayers
were
vain
brother
said
he
did
not
know
that
god
sometimes
deigns
to
reveal
himself
to
man
in
acts
of
mystery
i
doubted
and
deserve
to
be
punished
besides
i
do
not
wish
to
lose
my
salvation
in
the
pleasures
of
this
life
at
these
words
the
viscount
embraced
me
again
mounted
his
horse
and
disappeared
he
went
to
the
carthusian
monastery
at
morlaix
two
years
afterward
fasts
macerations
and
grief
had
made
of
this
bon
vivant
this
joyous
companion
this
devoted
friend
a
premature
skeleton
at
the
end
of
three
years
he
died
leaving
me
all
his
wealth
diable
what
a
frightful
tale
said
du
couëdic
but
the
old
woman
forgot
to
tell
you
that
breaking
your
leg
would
double
your
fortune
listen
said
pontcalec
more
gravely
than
ever
ah
it
is
not
finished
said
talhouet
we
are
only
at
the
commencement
continue
we
are
listening
you
have
all
heard
of
the
strange
death
of
the
baron
de
caradec
have
you
not
our
old
college
friend
at
nantes
said
montlouis
who
was
found
murdered
ten
years
ago
in
the
forest
of
chateaubriant
yes
now
listen
but
remember
that
this
is
a
secret
which
till
this
moment
has
been
only
known
to
me
and
which
even
now
must
go
no
further
than
ourselves
the
three
bretons
who
were
deeply
interested
gave
the
required
promises
well
said
pontcalec
this
college
friendship
of
which
montlouis
speaks
had
undergone
some
change
between
caradec
and
myself
on
account
of
a
rivalry
we
loved
the
same
woman
and
i
was
loved
by
her
one
day
i
determined
to
hunt
the
stag
in
the
forest
of
chateaubriant
my
dogs
and
huntsmen
had
been
sent
out
the
day
before
and
i
was
on
my
way
to
the
rendezvous
when
on
the
road
before
me
i
saw
an
enormous
fagot
walking
along
this
did
not
surprise
me
for
our
peasants
carry
such
enormous
fagots
that
they
quite
disappear
under
their
load
but
this
fagot
appeared
from
behind
to
move
alone
soon
it
stopped
an
old
woman
turning
round
showed
her
face
to
me
as
i
approached
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
off
her
for
i
recognized
the
sorceress
of
savernay
who
had
predicted
the
misfortune
caused
by
my
white
pony
my
first
impulse
i
confess
was
to
take
another
road
and
avoid
the
prophetess
of
evil
but
she
had
already
seen
me
and
she
seemed
to
wait
for
me
with
a
smile
full
of
malice
i
was
ten
years
older
than
when
her
first
threat
had
frightened
me
i
was
ashamed
to
go
back
viscount
de
pontcalec
said
she
is
the
marquis
de
guer
good
woman
and
i
shall
be
quite
easy
about
him
if
you
will
assure
me
that
nothing
will
happen
to
him
during
my
absence
ah
said
she
laughing
have
not
forgotten
the
plains
of
savernay
you
have
a
good
memory
viscount
but
yet
if
i
gave
you
some
advice
you
would
not
follow
it
any
more
than
the
first
time
man
is
blind
what
is
your
advice
to
go
hunting
not
to
return
at
once
to
pontcalec
can
not
i
have
a
rendezvous
with
some
friends
at
chateaubriant
much
the
worse
viscount
for
blood
will
be
spilled
and
another
are
you
mad
said
your
uncle
crysogon
how
is
he
you
not
know
that
he
died
seven
years
ago
at
morlaix
fellow
said
the
woman
you
he
would
not
believe
at
length
he
beheld
but
it
was
too
late
i
shuddered
involuntarily
but
a
false
shame
whispered
that
it
would
be
cowardly
to
give
way
and
that
doubtless
the
fulfillment
of
the
pretended
witch
former
prediction
had
been
but
a
chance
i
see
that
a
former
experience
has
not
made
you
wiser
my
fine
fellow
said
she
go
to
chateaubriant
then
since
you
must
have
it
so
but
at
least
send
back
that
handsome
with
what
will
monsieur
cut
the
stag
foot
asked
the
servant
who
followed
me
your
knife
said
the
old
woman
stag
is
a
royal
animal
replied
the
servant
deserves
a
said
i
said
my
blood
would
flow
what
means
that
i
shall
be
attacked
and
if
so
i
shall
want
it
to
defend
myself
do
not
know
what
it
means
replied
the
old
woman
i
do
know
that
in
your
place
my
brave
gentleman
i
would
listen
to
a
poor
old
woman
and
that
i
would
not
go
to
chateaubriant
or
if
i
did
go
it
would
be
without
my
not
listen
to
the
old
witch
monsieur
said
the
servant
who
was
doubtless
afraid
to
take
the
fatal
weapon
if
i
had
been
alone
i
should
have
returned
but
before
my
servant
i
did
not
like
to
do
so
you
my
good
woman
said
i
really
i
do
not
see
what
reason
there
is
for
not
going
to
chateaubriant
as
to
my
knife
i
shall
keep
it
if
i
be
attacked
i
must
have
a
weapon
to
defend
myself
then
and
defend
yourself
said
the
old
woman
shaking
her
head
can
not
escape
our
destiny
i
heard
no
more
i
urged
my
horse
to
a
gallop
but
turning
a
corner
i
saw
that
the
old
woman
had
resumed
her
route
and
i
lost
sight
of
her
an
hour
after
i
was
in
the
forest
of
chateaubriant
and
i
met
you
montlouis
and
talhouet
for
you
were
both
of
the
party
it
is
true
said
talhouet
and
i
began
to
understand
and
i
said
montlouis
but
i
know
nothing
of
it
said
du
couëdic
so
pray
continue
pontcalec
our
dogs
started
the
deer
and
we
set
off
in
pursuit
but
we
were
not
the
only
hunters
in
the
forest
at
a
distance
we
heard
the
sound
of
another
pack
which
gradually
approached
soon
the
two
crossed
and
some
of
my
dogs
by
mistake
went
after
the
wrong
deer
i
ran
after
them
to
stop
them
which
separated
me
from
you
you
followed
the
rest
of
our
pack
but
some
one
had
forestalled
me
i
heard
the
howls
of
my
dogs
under
the
lash
of
a
whip
i
redoubled
my
pace
and
found
the
baron
de
caradec
striking
them
i
told
you
there
were
causes
of
dislike
between
us
which
only
needed
an
opportunity
to
burst
out
i
asked
him
why
he
struck
my
dogs
his
reply
was
haughtier
than
my
question
we
were
alone
we
were
both
twenty
years
of
age
we
were
rivals
each
was
armed
we
drew
our
knives
threw
ourselves
one
upon
the
other
and
caradec
fell
from
his
horse
pierced
through
the
body
to
tell
you
what
i
felt
when
i
saw
him
bleeding
and
writhing
in
agony
would
be
impossible
i
spurred
my
horse
and
darted
through
the
forest
like
a
madman
i
heard
the
voices
of
the
hunters
and
i
arrived
one
of
the
first
but
i
remember
do
you
remember
it
montlouis
that
you
asked
me
why
i
was
so
pale
i
do
said
montlouis
then
i
remembered
the
advice
of
the
sorceress
and
reproached
myself
bitterly
for
neglecting
it
this
solitary
and
fatal
duel
seemed
to
me
like
an
assassination
nantes
and
its
environs
became
insupportable
to
me
for
every
day
i
heard
of
the
murder
of
caradec
it
is
true
that
no
one
suspected
me
but
the
secret
voice
of
my
conscience
spoke
so
loud
that
twenty
times
i
was
on
the
point
of
denouncing
myself
then
i
left
nantes
and
went
to
paris
but
not
until
i
had
searched
for
the
sorceress
not
knowing
either
her
name
or
her
residence
i
could
not
find
her
it
is
strange
said
talhouet
and
have
you
ever
seen
her
since
wait
said
pontcalec
and
listen
for
now
comes
the
terrible
part
this
winter
or
rather
last
autumn
i
say
winter
because
there
was
snow
falling
though
it
was
only
in
november
i
was
returning
from
guer
and
had
ordered
a
halt
at
after
a
day
during
which
i
had
been
shooting
snipes
in
the
marshes
with
two
of
my
tenants
we
arrived
benumbed
with
cold
at
the
rendezvous
and
found
a
good
fire
and
supper
awaiting
us
as
i
entered
and
received
the
salutations
and
compliments
of
my
people
i
perceived
in
the
an
old
woman
wrapped
in
a
large
cloak
who
appeared
to
be
asleep
is
that
i
asked
of
the
farmer
and
trembling
involuntarily
old
beggar
whom
i
do
not
know
and
she
looks
like
a
witch
said
he
she
was
perishing
with
cold
hunger
and
fatigue
she
came
begging
i
told
her
to
come
in
and
gave
her
a
piece
of
bread
which
she
eat
while
she
warmed
herself
and
now
she
has
gone
to
sleep
the
figure
moved
slightly
in
its
corner
has
happened
to
you
monsieur
le
marquis
asked
the
wife
you
are
so
wet
and
that
your
clothes
are
splashed
with
mud
up
to
the
shoulder
nearly
had
to
dine
without
me
my
good
martine
i
replied
this
repast
and
this
fire
were
prepared
for
cried
the
good
woman
alarmed
monsieur
had
a
narrow
escape
said
the
farmer
so
my
good
lord
know
your
marshes
are
full
of
bogs
i
ventured
without
sounding
the
ground
and
all
at
once
i
felt
that
i
was
sinking
in
so
that
had
it
not
been
for
my
gun
which
i
held
across
enabling
your
husband
to
come
and
pull
me
out
i
should
have
been
smothered
which
is
not
only
a
cruel
but
a
stupid
death
monsieur
said
the
wife
do
not
expose
yourself
in
this
way
him
alone
said
the
sepulchral
voice
of
the
figure
crouched
in
the
will
not
die
thus
i
foretell
that
and
lowering
the
hood
of
her
gray
cloak
she
showed
me
the
face
of
that
woman
who
had
twice
crossed
my
path
with
sad
prediction
i
remained
motionless
and
petrified
recognize
me
she
asked
without
moving
i
made
a
sign
of
assent
but
had
not
really
the
courage
to
reply
all
gathered
in
a
circle
round
us
no
continued
she
easy
marquis
de
guer
you
will
not
die
thus
do
you
know
i
stammered
out
with
a
conviction
however
that
she
did
know
can
not
tell
you
for
i
do
not
know
myself
but
you
know
well
that
i
do
not
make
mistakes
how
shall
i
die
asked
i
making
an
effort
over
myself
to
ask
this
question
and
to
listen
to
her
reply
will
die
by
the
sea
beware
of
the
water
marquis
de
guer
she
replied
asked
i
do
you
mean
have
spoken
and
can
not
explain
further
marquis
but
again
i
say
of
the
water
all
the
peasants
looked
frightened
some
muttered
prayers
others
crossed
themselves
the
old
woman
returned
to
her
corner
buried
herself
again
in
her
cloak
and
did
not
speak
another
syllable
chapter
xxiv
the
arrest
the
details
of
this
affair
may
some
day
escape
my
memory
but
the
impression
it
made
will
never
be
effaced
i
had
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
and
this
prediction
took
the
aspect
of
a
reality
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
yes
continued
pontcalec
even
though
you
should
laugh
like
my
uncle
crysogon
you
would
never
change
my
opinion
or
take
away
from
me
the
conviction
that
the
prediction
will
be
realized
therefore
i
tell
you
were
it
true
that
we
are
pursued
by
dubois
exempts
were
there
a
boat
ready
to
take
us
to
belle
isle
to
escape
them
so
convinced
am
i
that
the
sea
will
be
fatal
to
me
and
that
no
other
death
has
any
power
over
me
that
i
would
give
myself
up
to
my
pursuers
and
say
your
worst
i
shall
not
die
by
your
hands
the
three
bretons
had
listened
in
silence
to
this
strange
declaration
which
gathered
solemnity
from
the
circumstances
in
which
they
stood
then
said
du
couëdic
after
a
pause
we
understand
your
courage
my
friend
believing
yourself
destined
to
one
sort
of
death
you
are
indifferent
to
all
other
danger
but
take
care
if
the
anecdote
were
known
it
would
rob
you
of
all
merit
not
in
our
eyes
for
we
know
what
you
really
are
but
others
would
say
that
you
entered
this
conspiracy
because
you
can
neither
be
beheaded
shot
nor
killed
by
the
dagger
but
that
it
would
have
been
very
different
if
conspirators
were
drowned
and
perhaps
they
would
speak
the
truth
said
pontcalec
smiling
but
my
dear
marquis
said
montlouis
we
who
have
not
the
same
grounds
for
security
should
i
think
pay
some
attention
to
the
advice
of
our
unknown
friend
and
leave
nantes
or
even
france
as
soon
as
possible
but
this
may
be
wrong
said
pontcalec
and
i
do
not
believe
our
projects
are
known
at
nantes
or
elsewhere
and
probably
nothing
will
be
known
till
gaston
has
done
his
work
said
talhouet
and
then
we
shall
have
nothing
to
fear
but
enthusiasm
and
that
does
not
kill
as
to
you
pontcalec
never
approach
a
seaport
never
go
to
sea
and
you
will
live
to
the
age
of
methuselah
the
conversation
might
have
continued
in
this
jocular
strain
but
at
this
moment
several
gentlemen
with
whom
they
had
appointed
a
meeting
came
in
by
different
secret
ways
and
in
different
costumes
it
was
not
that
they
had
much
to
fear
from
the
provincial
police
that
of
nantes
though
nantes
was
a
large
town
was
not
sufficiently
well
organized
to
alarm
conspirators
who
had
in
the
locality
the
influence
of
name
and
social
position
but
the
police
of
paris
the
police
or
that
of
dubois
sent
down
spies
who
were
easily
detected
by
their
ignorance
of
the
place
and
the
difference
of
their
dress
and
speech
though
this
breton
association
was
numerous
we
shall
only
occupy
ourselves
with
its
four
chiefs
who
were
beyond
all
the
others
in
name
fortune
courage
and
intelligence
they
discussed
a
new
edict
of
montesquieu
and
the
necessity
of
arming
themselves
in
case
of
violence
on
the
marshal
part
thus
it
was
nothing
less
than
the
beginning
of
a
civil
war
for
which
the
pretexts
were
the
impiety
of
the
regent
court
and
dubois
sacrileges
pretexts
which
would
arouse
the
anathemas
of
an
essentially
religious
province
against
a
reign
so
little
worthy
to
succeed
that
of
louis
xiv
pontcalec
explained
their
plan
not
suspecting
that
at
that
moment
dubois
police
had
sent
a
detachment
to
each
of
their
dwellings
and
that
an
exempt
was
even
then
on
the
spot
with
orders
to
arrest
them
thus
all
who
had
taken
part
in
the
meeting
saw
from
afar
the
bayonets
of
soldiers
at
their
houses
and
thus
being
forewarned
they
might
probably
escape
by
a
speedy
flight
they
might
easily
find
retreats
among
their
numerous
friends
many
of
them
might
gain
the
coast
and
escape
to
holland
spain
or
england

couëdic
montlouis
and
talhouet
as
usual
went
out
together
but
on
arriving
at
the
end
of
the
street
where
house
was
situated
they
perceived
lights
crossing
the
windows
of
the
apartments
and
a
sentinel
barring
the
door
with
his
musket
oh
said
montlouis
stopping
his
companions
what
is
going
on
at
my
house
indeed
there
is
something
said
talhouet
and
just
now
i
fancied
i
saw
a
sentinel
at
the
hotel
de
rouen
why
did
you
not
say
so
asked
du
couëdic
it
was
surely
worth
mentioning
oh
i
was
afraid
of
appearing
an
alarmist
and
i
thought
it
might
be
only
a
patrol
but
this
man
belongs
to
the
regiment
of
picardy
said
montlouis
stepping
back
it
is
strange
said
pontcalec
let
me
go
up
the
lane
which
leads
to
my
house
if
that
also
be
guarded
there
will
be
no
further
doubt
keeping
together
in
case
of
an
attack
they
went
on
silently
till
they
saw
a
detachment
of
twenty
men
grouped
round
pontcalec
house
this
passes
a
joke
said
du
couëdic
and
unless
our
houses
have
all
caught
fire
at
once
i
do
not
understand
these
uniforms
around
them
as
to
me
i
shall
leave
mine
most
certainly
and
i
said
talhouet
shall
be
off
to
and
from
thence
to
le
croisic
take
my
advice
and
come
with
me
i
know
a
brig
about
to
start
for
newfoundland
and
the
captain
is
a
servant
of
mine
if
the
air
on
shore
becomes
too
bad
we
will
embark
set
sail
and
vogue
la
galères
come
pontcalec
forget
your
old
witch
and
come
with
us
no
no
said
pontcalec
i
will
not
rush
on
my
fate
reflect
my
friends
we
are
the
chiefs
and
we
should
set
a
strange
example
by
flying
before
we
even
know
if
a
real
danger
exists
there
is
no
proof
against
us
la
jonquiere
is
incorruptible
gaston
is
intrepid
our
letters
from
him
say
that
all
will
soon
be
over
perhaps
at
this
very
moment
france
may
be
delivered
and
the
regent
dead
what
would
be
thought
of
us
if
at
such
a
time
we
had
taken
flight
the
example
of
our
desertion
would
ruin
everything
here
consider
it
well
i
do
not
command
you
as
a
chief
but
i
counsel
you
as
a
friend
you
are
not
obliged
to
obey
for
i
free
you
from
your
oath
but
in
your
place
i
would
not
go
we
have
given
an
example
of
devotion
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
us
is
to
give
that
of
martyrdom
but
this
will
not
i
hope
be
the
case
if
we
are
arrested
the
breton
parliament
will
judge
us
of
what
is
it
composed
of
our
friends
and
accomplices
we
are
safer
in
a
prison
of
which
they
hold
the
key
than
on
a
vessel
at
the
mercy
of
the
winds
besides
before
the
parliament
has
assembled
all
bretagne
will
be
in
arms
tried
we
are
absolved
absolved
we
are
triumphant
he
is
right
said
talhouet
my
uncle
my
brothers
all
my
family
are
compromised
with
me
i
shall
save
myself
with
them
or
die
with
him
my
dear
talhouet
said
montlouis
all
this
is
very
fine
but
i
have
a
worse
opinion
of
this
affair
than
you
have
if
we
are
in
the
hands
of
any
one
it
is
dubois
who
is
not
a
gentleman
and
hates
those
who
are
i
do
not
like
these
people
who
belong
to
no
class
who
are
neither
nobles
soldiers
nor
priests
i
like
better
a
true
gentleman
a
soldier
or
a
monk
at
least
they
are
all
supported
by
the
authority
of
their
profession
however
i
appeal
as
we
generally
do
to
the
majority
but
i
confess
that
if
it
be
for
flight
i
shall
fly
most
willingly
and
i
said
du
couëdic
montesquieu
may
be
better
informed
than
we
suppose
and
if
it
be
dubois
who
holds
us
in
his
clutches
we
shall
have
some
difficulty
in
freeing
ourselves
and
i
repeat
we
must
remain
said
pontcalec
the
duty
of
a
general
is
to
remain
at
the
head
of
his
soldiers
the
duty
of
the
chief
of
a
conspiracy
is
to
die
at
the
head
of
the
plot
my
dear
friend
said
montlouis
your
sorceress
blinds
you
to
gain
credence
for
her
prediction
you
are
ready
to
drown
yourself
intentionally
i
am
less
enthusiastic
about
this
pythoness
i
confess
and
as
i
do
not
know
what
kind
of
death
is
in
store
for
me
i
am
somewhat
uneasy
you
are
mistaken
montlouis
said
pontcalec
it
is
duty
above
all
which
influences
me
and
besides
if
i
do
not
die
for
this
you
will
not
for
i
am
your
chief
and
certainly
before
the
judges
i
should
reclaim
the
title
which
i
have
abjured
if
i
do
not
die
by
dubois
neither
will
you
we
soldiers
and
afraid
to
pay
an
official
visit
to
parliament
for
that
is
it
after
all
and
nothing
else
benches
covered
with
black
robes
smiles
of
intelligence
between
the
accused
and
the
judge
it
is
a
battle
with
the
regent
let
us
accept
it
and
when
parliament
shall
absolve
us
we
shall
have
done
as
well
as
if
we
had
put
to
flight
all
the
troops
in
bretagne
montlouis
proposed
to
refer
it
to
a
majority
said
du
couëdic
let
us
do
so
i
did
not
speak
from
fear
said
montlouis
but
i
do
not
see
the
use
of
walking
into
the
lion
mouth
if
we
can
muzzle
him
that
was
unnecessary
montlouis
said
pontcalec
we
all
know
you
and
we
accept
your
proposition
let
those
who
are
for
flight
hold
up
their
hands
montlouis
and
du
couëdic
raised
their
hands
we
are
two
and
two
said
montlouis
we
must
then
trust
to
inspiration
you
forget
said
pontcalec
that
as
president
i
have
two
votes
it
is
true
let
those
then
who
are
for
remaining
here
hold
up
their
hands
pontcalec
and
talhouet
raised
their
hands
thus
the
majority
was
fixed
this
deliberation
in
the
open
street
might
have
seemed
absurd
had
it
not
involved
in
its
results
the
question
of
life
or
death
to
four
of
the
noblest
gentlemen
in
bretagne
well
said
montlouis
it
appears
du
couëdic
that
we
were
wrong
and
now
marquis
we
obey
your
orders
see
what
i
do
said
pontcalec
and
then
do
as
you
like
and
he
walked
straight
up
to
his
house
followed
by
his
three
friends
arriving
at
the
door
he
tapped
a
soldier
on
the
shoulder
my
friend
said
he
call
your
officer
i
beg
the
soldier
passed
the
order
to
the
sergeant
who
called
the
captain
what
do
you
want
asked
the
i
want
to
come
into
my
house
who
are
you
i
am
the
marquis
de
pontcalec
silence
said
the
officer
in
a
low
voice
and
fly
instantly
i
am
here
to
arrest
you
then
aloud
you
can
not
pass
said
he
pushing
back
the
marquis
and
closing
in
his
soldiers
before
him
pontcalec
took
the
officer
hand
pressed
it
and
said
you
are
a
brave
fellow
but
i
must
go
in
i
thank
you
and
may
god
reward
you
the
officer
surprised
opened
his
ranks
and
pontcalec
followed
by
his
friends
crossed
the
court
on
seeing
him
his
family
uttered
cries
of
terror
what
is
it
asked
the
marquis
calmly
and
what
is
going
on
here
i
arrest
you
monsieur
le
marquis
said
an
exempt
of
the
provost
of
paris
pardieu
what
a
fine
exploit
said
montlouis
and
you
seem
a
clever
fellow
you
a
provost
exempt
and
absolutely
those
whom
you
are
sent
to
arrest
are
obliged
to
come
and
take
you
by
the
collar
the
exempt
saluted
this
gentleman
who
joked
so
pleasantly
at
such
a
time
and
asked
his
name
i
am
monsieur
de
montlouis
look
my
dear
fellow
if
you
have
not
got
an
order
against
me
too
if
you
have
execute
it
monsieur
said
the
exempt
bowing
lower
as
he
became
more
astonished
it
is
not
i
but
my
comrade
duchevon
who
is
charged
to
arrest
you
shall
i
tell
him
where
is
he
at
your
house
waiting
for
you
i
should
be
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting
long
said
montlouis
and
i
will
go
to
him
thanks
my
friend
the
exempt
was
bewildered
montlouis
pressed
pontcalec
hand
and
those
of
the
others
then
whispering
a
few
words
to
them
he
set
out
for
his
house
and
was
arrested
talhouet
and
du
couëdic
did
the
same
so
that
by
eleven
at
night
the
work
was
over
the
news
of
the
arrest
ran
through
the
town
but
every
one
said
the
parliament
will
absolve
them
the
next
day
however
their
opinions
changed
for
there
arrived
from
nantes
the
commission
perfectly
constituted
and
wanting
as
we
have
said
neither
president
procureur
du
roi
secretary
nor
even
executioners
we
use
the
plural
for
there
were
three
the
bravest
men
are
sometimes
stupefied
by
great
misfortune
this
fell
on
the
province
with
the
power
and
rapidity
of
a
thunderstroke
it
made
no
cry
no
movement
bretagne
expired
the
commission
installed
itself
at
once
and
expected
that
in
consideration
of
its
powers
people
would
bow
before
it
rather
than
give
offense
but
the
terror
was
so
great
that
each
one
thought
of
themselves
alone
and
merely
deplored
the
fate
of
the
others
this
then
was
the
state
of
affairs
in
bretagne
three
or
four
days
after
the
arrest
of
pontcalec
and
his
three
friends
let
us
leave
them
awhile
at
nantes
in
dubois
toils
and
see
what
was
passing
in
paris
chapter
xxv
the
bastille
and
now
with
the
reader
permission
we
will
enter
the
bastille
that
formidable
building
at
which
even
the
passing
traveler
trembled
and
which
to
the
whole
neighborhood
was
an
annoyance
and
cause
of
alarm
for
often
at
night
the
cries
of
the
unfortunate
prisoners
who
were
under
torture
might
be
heard
piercing
the
thick
walls
so
much
so
that
the
duchesse
de
lesdequieres
once
wrote
to
the
governor
that
if
he
did
not
prevent
his
patients
from
making
such
a
noise
she
should
complain
to
the
king
at
this
time
however
under
the
reign
of
philippe
there
were
no
cries
to
be
heard
the
society
was
select
and
too
well
bred
to
disturb
the
repose
of
a
lady
in
a
room
in
the
du
coin
tower
on
the
first
floor
was
a
prisoner
alone
the
room
was
large
and
resembled
an
immense
tomb
lighted
by
two
windows
furnished
with
an
unusual
allowance
of
bars
and
irons
a
painted
couch
two
rough
wooden
chairs
and
a
black
table
were
the
whole
furniture
the
walls
were
covered
with
strange
inscriptions
which
the
prisoner
consulted
from
time
to
time
when
he
was
overcome
by
ennui
illustration
abbe
page
he
had
however
been
but
one
day
in
the
bastille
and
yet
already
he
paced
his
vast
chamber
examining
the
doors
looking
through
the
grated
windows
listening
sighing
waiting
this
day
which
was
sunday
a
pale
sun
silvered
the
clouds
and
the
prisoner
watched
with
a
feeling
of
inexpressible
melancholy
the
walkers
on
the
boulevards
it
was
easy
to
see
that
every
looked
at
the
bastille
with
a
feeling
of
terror
and
of
at
not
being
within
its
walls
a
noise
of
bolts
and
creaking
hinges
drew
the
prisoner
from
this
sad
occupation
and
he
saw
the
man
enter
before
whom
he
had
been
taken
the
day
before
this
man
about
thirty
years
of
age
with
an
agreeable
appearance
and
polite
bearing
was
the
governor
de
launay
father
of
that
de
launay
who
died
at
his
post
in
the
prisoner
who
recognized
him
did
not
know
how
rare
such
visits
were
monsieur
de
chanlay
said
the
governor
bowing
i
come
to
know
if
you
have
passed
a
good
night
and
are
satisfied
with
the
fare
of
the
house
and
the
conduct
of
the
employés
thus
de
launay
in
his
politeness
called
the
turnkeys
and
jailers
yes
monsieur
and
these
attentions
paid
to
a
prisoner
have
surprised
me
i
own
the
bed
is
hard
and
old
but
yet
it
is
one
of
the
best
luxury
being
forbidden
by
our
rules
your
room
monsieur
is
the
best
in
the
bastille
it
has
been
occupied
by
the
duc
by
the
marquis
de
bassompierre
and
by
the
marshals
de
luxembourg
and
biron
it
is
here
that
i
lodge
the
princes
when
his
majesty
does
me
the
honor
to
send
them
to
me
it
is
an
excellent
lodging
said
gaston
smiling
though
ill
furnished
can
i
have
some
books
some
paper
and
pens
books
monsieur
are
strictly
forbidden
but
if
you
very
much
wish
to
read
as
many
things
are
allowed
to
a
prisoner
who
is
ennuyé
come
and
see
me
then
you
can
put
in
your
pocket
one
of
those
volumes
which
my
wife
or
i
leave
about
you
will
hide
it
from
all
eyes
on
a
second
visit
you
will
take
the
second
volume
and
to
this
abstraction
we
will
close
our
eyes
and
paper
pens
ink
said
gaston
i
wish
most
particularly
to
write
no
one
writes
here
monsieur
or
at
least
only
to
the
king
the
regent
the
minister
or
to
me
but
they
draw
and
i
can
let
you
have
and
pencils
monsieur
how
can
i
thank
you
sufficiently
for
your
kindness
by
granting
me
the
request
i
came
to
make
for
my
visit
is
an
interested
one
i
came
to
ask
if
you
would
do
me
the
honor
to
dine
with
me
with
you
monsieur
truly
you
surprise
me
however
i
can
not
tell
you
how
sensible
i
am
of
your
courtesy
and
should
retain
for
it
an
everlasting
gratitude
if
i
had
any
prospect
but
death
before
my
eyes
death
monsieur
you
are
gloomy
you
should
not
think
of
these
things
forget
them
and
accept
i
do
monsieur
a
la
bonne
heure
said
the
governor
bowing
to
gaston
i
will
take
back
your
answer
and
he
went
out
leaving
the
prisoner
plunged
in
a
new
train
of
ideas
the
politeness
which
at
first
charmed
the
chevalier
on
reflection
began
to
arouse
some
suspicion
might
it
not
be
intended
to
inspire
him
with
confidence
and
lead
him
on
to
betray
himself
and
his
companions
he
remembered
the
tragic
chronicle
of
the
bastille
the
snares
laid
for
prisoners
and
that
famous
dungeon
chamber
so
much
spoken
of
which
none
who
had
entered
ever
left
alive
gaston
felt
himself
alone
and
abandoned
he
also
felt
that
the
crime
he
had
meditated
deserved
death
did
not
all
these
flattering
and
strange
advances
conceal
some
snare
in
fact
the
bastille
had
done
its
ordinary
work
the
prison
acted
on
the
prisoner
who
became
cold
suspicious
and
uneasy
they
take
me
for
a
provincial
he
thought
and
they
hope
that
prudent
in
my
interrogatories
i
shall
be
imprudent
in
my
conduct
they
do
not
they
can
not
know
my
accomplices
and
they
hope
that
in
giving
me
the
means
of
communicating
with
them
of
writing
to
them
or
of
inadvertently
speaking
of
them
they
will
get
something
out
of
me
dubois
and
are
at
the
bottom
of
this
then
gaston
thought
of
his
friends
who
were
waiting
for
him
without
news
from
him
who
would
not
know
what
had
become
of
him
or
worse
still
on
some
false
news
might
act
and
ruin
themselves
then
came
the
thought
of
his
poor
helene
isolated
as
he
himself
was
whom
he
had
not
even
presented
to
the
duc
her
sole
protector
for
the
future
and
who
might
himself
be
arrested
or
have
taken
flight
then
what
would
become
of
helene
without
support
and
pursued
by
that
unknown
person
who
had
sought
her
even
in
the
heart
of
bretagne
in
a
paroxysm
of
despair
at
this
thought
gaston
threw
himself
on
his
bed
cursing
the
doors
and
bars
which
imprisoned
him
and
striking
the
stones
with
his
hands
at
this
moment
there
was
a
noise
at
the
door
gaston
rose
hastily
and
met
with
a
law
officer
and
behind
them
an
imposing
escort
of
soldiers
he
understood
that
he
was
to
be
interrogated
with
his
great
wig
large
black
eyes
and
dark
shaggy
eyebrows
made
little
impression
on
the
chevalier
he
knew
that
in
joining
the
conspiracy
he
sacrificed
his
happiness
and
that
in
entering
the
bastille
he
had
sacrificed
his
life
in
this
mood
it
was
difficult
to
frighten
him
asked
a
hundred
questions
which
gaston
refused
to
answer
replying
only
by
complaints
of
being
unjustly
arrested
and
demanding
proof
became
angry
and
gaston
laughed
in
his
face
then
spoke
of
the
breton
conspiracy
gaston
assumed
astonishment
and
listened
to
the
list
of
his
accomplices
with
the
greatest
sangfroid
when
the
magistrate
had
finished
he
thanked
him
for
giving
him
intelligence
of
events
which
were
quite
new
to
him
again
lost
patience
and
gave
his
ordinary
angry
cough
then
he
passed
from
interrogatory
to
accusation
you
wanted
to
kill
the
regent
said
he
all
at
once
to
the
chevalier
how
do
you
know
that
asked
gaston
calmly
never
mind
how
since
i
know
it
then
i
will
answer
you
as
agamemnon
did
achilles
why
ask
since
you
know
it
monsieur
i
am
not
jesting
said
nor
i
said
gaston
i
only
quote
racine
take
care
monsieur
you
may
find
this
system
of
defense
do
you
no
good
do
you
think
it
would
be
better
to
confess
what
you
ask
me
it
is
useless
to
deny
a
fact
which
i
am
aware
of
then
permit
me
to
repeat
my
question
what
is
the
use
of
asking
me
about
a
project
of
which
apparently
you
are
so
much
better
informed
than
i
am
i
want
the
details
ask
your
police
which
reads
even
people
most
secret
thoughts
hum
hum
said
in
a
tone
which
in
spite
of
courage
made
some
impression
on
him
what
would
you
say
if
i
asked
news
of
your
friend
la
jonquiere
i
should
say
replied
gaston
turning
pale
that
i
hope
the
same
mistake
has
not
been
made
about
him
as
about
me
ah
said
that
name
touches
you
i
think
you
know
la
jonquiere
i
know
him
as
a
friend
recommended
to
me
to
show
me
paris
yes
paris
and
its
environs
the
palais
royal
the
rue
du
bac
or
la
muette
he
was
to
show
you
all
these
was
he
not
they
know
all
thought
gaston
well
monsieur
said
can
you
find
another
verse
from
racine
which
will
serve
as
an
answer
to
my
question
perhaps
i
might
if
i
knew
what
you
meant
certainly
i
wished
to
see
the
palais
royal
for
it
is
a
curious
place
and
i
have
heard
it
much
spoken
of
as
to
the
rue
du
bac
i
know
little
of
it
then
there
only
remains
la
muette
of
which
i
know
nothing
i
do
not
say
that
you
have
been
there
i
say
that
la
jonquiere
was
to
take
you
there
do
you
dare
to
deny
it
ma
foi
monsieur
i
neither
deny
nor
avow
i
refer
you
to
him
he
will
answer
you
if
he
think
fit
it
is
useless
monsieur
he
has
been
asked
and
has
replied
gaston
felt
a
shudder
pass
through
him
he
might
be
betrayed
but
he
would
divulge
nothing
he
kept
silence
waited
a
moment
then
seeing
that
gaston
remained
silent
would
you
like
to
meet
la
jonquiere
asked
he
you
can
do
with
me
as
you
please
monsieur
said
gaston
i
am
in
your
hands
but
at
the
same
time
he
resolved
if
he
were
to
face
la
jonquiere
he
would
crush
him
beneath
his
contempt
it
is
well
as
you
say
i
am
the
master
and
i
choose
just
now
to
apply
the
ordinary
and
extraordinary
question
do
you
know
what
they
are
monsieur
said
leaning
on
each
syllable
a
cold
sweat
bathed
gaston
temples
not
that
he
feared
to
die
but
torture
was
worse
than
death
a
victim
of
the
torture
was
always
disfigured
or
crippled
and
the
best
of
these
alternatives
was
a
cruel
one
for
a
young
man
of
five
and
twenty
saw
as
in
a
mirror
what
was
passing
in
gaston
mind
hola
said
the
interrogator
two
men
entered
here
is
a
gentleman
who
seems
to
have
no
dislike
to
the
question
ordinary
or
extraordinary
take
him
to
the
room
it
is
the
dark
hour
the
hour
i
expected
murmured
gaston
oh
my
god
give
me
courage
doubtless
his
prayer
was
heard
for
making
a
sign
that
he
was
ready
he
followed
the
guards
with
a
firm
step
came
behind
him
they
descended
the
stone
staircase
and
passed
the
first
dungeon
in
the
tower
there
they
crossed
two
courts
as
they
crossed
the
second
court
some
prisoners
looking
through
their
windows
and
seeing
a
gentleman
well
dressed
called
out
hola
monsieur
you
are
set
free
then
a
woman
voice
added
monsieur
if
you
are
asked
about
us
when
you
are
free
from
here
say
that
we
said
nothing
a
young
man
voice
said
you
are
happy
monsieur
you
will
see
her
you
love
you
are
mistaken
monsieur
said
the
chevalier
i
am
about
to
suffer
the
question
a
terrible
silence
succeeded
then
the
sad
procession
went
over
the
drawbridge
gaston
was
placed
in
a
closed
and
locked
chair
and
taken
to
the
arsenal
which
was
separated
from
the
bastille
by
a
narrow
passage
had
taken
the
lead
and
awaited
the
prisoner
who
found
himself
in
a
low
room
covered
with
damp
on
the
wall
hung
chains
collars
and
other
strange
instruments
chafing
dishes
stood
on
the
ground
and
crosses
of
saint
andre
were
in
the
corner
you
see
this
said
showing
the
chevalier
two
rings
fastened
into
flagstones
at
six
feet
apart
and
separated
by
a
wooden
bench
about
three
feet
high
in
these
rings
are
placed
the
head
and
feet
of
the
patient
then
this
tressel
is
placed
under
him
so
that
his
stomach
is
two
feet
higher
than
his
mouth
then
we
pour
pots
of
water
holding
two
pints
each
into
his
mouth
the
number
is
fixed
at
eight
for
the
ordinary
ten
for
the
extraordinary
question
if
the
patient
refuses
to
swallow
we
pinch
his
nose
so
that
he
can
not
breathe
then
he
opens
his
mouth
then
he
swallows
this
question
continued
he
emphasizing
every
detail
is
very
disagreeable
and
yet
i
do
not
think
i
should
prefer
the
boot
both
kill
sometimes
the
boot
disfigures
the
patient
and
it
is
true
that
the
water
destroys
his
health
for
the
future
but
it
is
rare
for
the
prisoner
always
speaks
at
the
ordinary
question
if
he
be
guilty
and
generally
at
the
extraordinary
if
he
be
not
gaston
pale
and
silent
listened
and
watched
do
you
prefer
the
wedges
chevalier
here
bring
the
wedges
a
man
brought
six
wedges
and
showed
them
still
stained
with
blood
and
flattened
at
the
edges
by
the
blows
which
had
been
struck
upon
them
do
you
know
the
way
in
which
these
are
used
the
knees
and
ankles
of
the
patient
are
pressed
between
two
wooden
slabs
as
tightly
as
possible
then
one
of
these
men
forces
a
wedge
between
the
knees
which
is
followed
by
a
larger
one
there
are
eight
for
the
ordinary
torture
and
two
larger
for
the
extraordinary
these
wedges
i
warn
you
chevalier
break
bones
like
glass
and
wound
the
flesh
insupportably
enough
enough
said
gaston
unless
you
wish
to
double
the
torture
by
describing
it
but
if
it
be
only
to
guide
my
choice
i
leave
it
to
you
as
you
must
know
them
better
than
i
and
i
shall
be
grateful
if
you
will
choose
the
one
which
will
kill
me
most
quickly
could
not
conceal
the
admiration
with
which
gaston
strength
of
will
inspired
him
come
said
he
speak
and
you
shall
not
be
tortured
i
have
nothing
to
say
monsieur
so
i
can
not
do
not
play
the
spartan
i
advise
you
one
may
cry
but
between
the
cries
one
always
speaks
under
torture
try
said
gaston
gaston
resolute
air
in
spite
of
the
struggle
of
nature
a
struggle
which
was
evidenced
by
his
paleness
and
by
a
slight
nervous
tremor
which
shook
him
gave
the
measure
of
his
courage
he
was
accustomed
to
this
kind
of
thing
and
was
rarely
mistaken
he
saw
that
he
should
get
nothing
out
of
him
yet
he
persisted
come
monsieur
said
he
it
is
still
time
do
not
force
us
to
do
you
any
violence
monsieur
said
gaston
i
swear
before
god
who
hears
me
that
if
you
put
me
to
the
torture
instead
of
speaking
i
will
hold
my
breath
and
stifle
myself
if
the
thing
be
possible
judge
then
if
i
am
likely
to
yield
to
threats
where
i
am
determined
not
to
yield
to
pain
signed
to
the
tormentors
who
approached
gaston
but
as
they
did
so
he
seemed
to
gain
new
strength
with
a
calm
smile
he
helped
them
to
remove
his
coat
and
to
unfasten
his
cuffs
it
is
to
be
the
water
then
asked
the
man
the
water
first
said
they
passed
the
cords
through
the
rings
brought
the
tressels
filled
the
vases
gaston
did
not
flinch
reflected
after
about
ten
minutes
thought
which
seemed
an
age
to
the
chevalier
let
him
go
said
with
a
grunt
of
discontent
and
take
him
back
to
the
bastille
chapter
xxvi
how
life
passed
in
the
bastille
while
waiting
for
death
gaston
was
inclined
to
thank
the
lieutenant
of
police
but
he
refrained
it
might
appear
as
though
he
had
been
afraid
he
took
his
hat
and
coat
and
returned
to
the
bastille
as
he
had
come
they
did
not
like
to
put
a
man
of
high
birth
to
the
torture
thought
he
they
will
try
me
and
condemn
me
to
death
but
death
seemed
easy
when
divested
of
the
preliminary
agonies
which
the
lieutenant
of
police
had
so
minutely
described
on
his
room
gaston
saw
almost
with
joy
all
that
had
seemed
so
horrible
to
him
an
hour
before
the
prison
seemed
gay
the
view
charming
the
saddest
inscriptions
on
the
walls
were
madrigals
compared
to
the
menacing
appearance
of
the
room
he
had
just
quitted
the
major
of
the
bastille
came
to
fetch
him
about
an
hour
afterward
accompanied
by
a
turnkey
i
understand
thought
gaston
the
governor
invitation
is
a
pretext
in
such
a
case
to
take
from
the
prisoner
the
anguish
of
expectation
i
shall
doubtless
cross
some
dungeon
into
which
i
shall
fall
and
die
god
will
be
done
and
with
a
firm
step
he
followed
the
major
expecting
every
moment
to
be
precipitated
into
some
secret
dungeon
and
murmuring
helene
name
that
he
might
die
with
it
on
his
lips
but
no
accident
following
this
poetical
and
loving
invocation
the
prisoner
quietly
arrived
at
the
governor
door
de
launay
came
to
meet
him
will
you
give
me
your
word
of
honor
chevalier
said
he
not
to
attempt
to
escape
while
you
are
in
my
house
it
is
understood
of
course
he
added
smiling
that
this
parole
is
withdrawn
as
soon
as
you
are
taken
back
to
your
own
room
and
it
is
only
a
precaution
to
insure
me
a
continuance
of
your
society
i
give
you
my
word
so
far
said
gaston
is
well
monsieur
enter
you
are
expected
and
he
led
gaston
to
a
room
where
a
numerous
company
was
already
assembled
i
have
the
honor
to
present
to
you
le
chevalier
gaston
de
chanlay
said
the
governor
then
naming
in
turn
each
of
the
persons
assembled
le
duc
de
richelieu
le
comte
de
laval
le
chevalier
dumesnil
de
malezieux
ah
said
gaston
smiling
all
the
cellamare
conspiracy
except
and
madame
de
maine
and
the
prince
of
cellamare
said
the
abbe
brigaud
bowing
ah
monsieur
said
gaston
in
a
reproachful
tone
you
forget
the
brave
and
the
learned
mademoiselle
de
launay
is
kept
in
bed
by
his
wounds
said
brigaud
as
to
mademoiselle
de
launay
said
the
chevalier
dumesnil
reddening
with
pleasure
here
she
comes
she
does
us
the
honor
of
dining
with
us
present
me
monsieur
said
gaston
among
prisoners
we
must
not
make
ceremonies
i
reckon
therefore
on
you
and
dumesnil
taking
gaston
by
the
hand
presented
him
to
mademoiselle
de
launay
gaston
could
not
repress
a
certain
expression
of
astonishment
at
all
he
saw
ah
chevalier
said
the
governor
i
see
that
like
of
the
inhabitants
of
paris
you
thought
i
devoured
my
prisoners
no
monsieur
said
gaston
but
i
certainly
thought
for
a
moment
that
i
should
not
have
had
the
honor
of
dining
with
you
how
so
is
it
the
habit
to
give
your
prisoners
an
appetite
for
their
dinners
by
the
walk
i
have
had
ah
yes
cried
mademoiselle
de
launay
was
it
not
you
who
were
being
led
to
the
torture
just
now
myself
mademoiselle
and
be
assured
that
only
such
a
hindrance
would
have
kept
me
from
so
charming
a
society
ah
these
things
are
not
in
my
jurisdiction
said
the
governor
thank
heaven
i
am
a
soldier
and
not
a
judge
do
not
confound
arms
and
the
toga
as
cicero
says
my
business
is
to
keep
you
here
and
to
make
your
stay
as
agreeable
as
possible
so
that
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
business
is
to
have
you
tortured
hanged
beheaded
put
on
the
wheel
quartered
if
possible
each
to
his
task
mademoiselle
de
launay
added
he
dinner
is
ready
will
you
take
my
arm
your
pardon
chevalier
dumesnil
you
think
me
a
tyrant
i
am
sure
but
as
host
i
am
privileged
gentlemen
seat
yourselves
what
a
horrible
thing
a
prison
is
said
richelieu
delicately
turning
up
his
cuffs
slavery
irons
bolts
chains
shall
i
pass
you
this
potage
à
said
the
governor
yes
monsieur
said
the
duke
your
cook
does
it
beautifully
and
i
am
really
annoyed
that
mine
did
not
conspire
with
me
he
might
have
profited
by
his
stay
in
the
bastille
there
is
champagne
said
de
launay
i
have
it
direct
from
ai
you
must
give
me
the
address
said
richelieu
for
if
the
regent
leaves
me
my
head
i
shall
drink
no
other
wine
than
this
i
have
got
accustomed
to
it
during
my
sojourns
here
and
i
am
a
creature
of
habit
indeed
said
the
governor
you
may
all
take
example
by
richelieu
he
is
most
faithful
to
me
and
in
fact
unless
we
are
overcrowded
i
always
keep
his
room
ready
for
him
that
tyrant
of
a
regent
may
force
us
all
to
keep
a
room
here
said
brigaud
monsieur
de
launay
said
laval
in
an
angry
tone
permit
me
to
ask
if
it
was
by
your
orders
that
i
was
awoke
at
two
this
morning
and
the
meaning
of
this
persecution
it
is
not
my
fault
monsieur
you
must
blame
these
gentlemen
and
ladies
who
will
not
keep
quiet
in
spite
of
all
i
tell
them
we
cried
all
the
guests
certainly
replied
the
governor
you
all
break
through
rules
i
am
always
having
reports
of
communications
correspondences
notes
etc
richelieu
laughed
dumesnil
and
mademoiselle
de
launay
blushed
but
we
will
speak
of
that
at
dessert
you
do
not
drink
de
chanlay
no
i
am
listening
say
that
you
are
dreaming
you
can
not
deceive
me
thus
and
of
what
asked
malezieux
ah
it
is
easy
to
see
that
you
are
getting
old
my
poetical
friend
of
what
should
de
chanlay
dream
but
of
his
love
is
it
not
better
de
chanlay
cried
richelieu
to
have
your
head
separated
from
your
body
than
your
body
from
your
soul
apropos
interrupted
laval
is
there
any
news
from
the
court
how
is
the
king
no
politics
gentlemen
if
you
please
said
the
governor
let
us
discuss
poetry
arts
war
and
even
the
bastille
if
you
like
but
let
us
avoid
politics
ah
yes
said
richelieu
let
us
talk
of
the
bastille
what
have
you
done
with
pompadour
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
forced
me
to
place
him
in
the
dungeon
what
had
he
done
asked
gaston
he
had
beaten
his
jailer
how
long
has
it
been
forbidden
for
a
gentleman
to
beat
his
servant
asked
richelieu
the
jailers
are
servants
of
the
king
le
duc
said
de
launay
smiling
say
rather
of
the
regent
a
subtle
distinction
a
just
one
shall
i
pass
you
the
chambertin
de
laval
if
you
will
drink
with
me
to
the
health
of
the
king
certainly
if
afterward
you
will
drink
with
me
to
the
health
of
the
regent
monsieur
said
laval
i
am
no
longer
thirsty
i
believe
it
you
have
just
drunk
some
wine
from
his
cellar
from
the
regent
he
sent
it
me
yesterday
knowing
that
i
was
to
have
the
pleasure
of
your
company
in
that
case
said
brigaud
throwing
the
contents
of
his
glass
upon
the
floor
no
more
poison
oh
said
malezieux
i
did
not
know
you
were
such
a
fanatic
for
the
good
cause
you
were
wrong
to
spill
it
abbe
said
richelieu
i
know
that
wine
and
you
will
hardly
find
such
out
of
the
palais
royal
if
it
were
against
your
principles
to
drink
it
you
should
have
passed
it
to
your
neighbor
or
put
it
back
in
the
bottle
in
amphoram
said
my
schoolmaster
le
duc
said
brigaud
you
do
not
know
latin
as
well
as
spanish
i
know
french
still
less
and
i
want
to
learn
it
oh
that
would
be
long
and
tedious
better
get
admitted
into
the
academy
it
would
be
far
easier
and
do
you
speak
spanish
asked
richelieu
of
de
chanlay
report
says
monsieur
that
i
am
here
for
the
abuse
of
that
tongue
monsieur
said
the
governor
if
you
return
to
politics
i
must
leave
the
table
then
said
richelieu
tell
mademoiselle
de
launay
to
talk
mathematics
that
will
not
frighten
any
one
mademoiselle
de
launay
started
she
had
been
carrying
on
a
conversation
with
dumesnil
which
had
been
greatly
exciting
the
jealousy
of
who
was
in
love
with
her
when
dinner
was
over
the
governor
conducted
each
guest
back
to
his
own
room
and
when
it
came
to
gaston
turn
he
asked
de
launay
if
he
could
have
some
razors
instruments
which
appeared
necessary
in
a
place
where
such
elegant
company
was
assembled
monsieur
le
chevalier
said
the
governor
i
am
distressed
to
refuse
you
a
thing
of
which
i
see
the
necessity
but
it
is
against
the
rules
for
any
one
to
shave
themselves
unless
they
have
special
permission
from
the
lieutenant
of
police
no
doubt
you
will
obtain
the
permission
if
you
apply
for
it
but
are
those
gentlemen
whom
i
met
here
privileged
for
they
were
well
dressed
and
shaved
no
they
all
had
to
ask
permission
the
duc
de
richelieu
remained
for
a
month
with
a
beard
like
a
patriarch
i
find
it
difficult
to
reconcile
such
severity
in
detail
with
the
liberty
i
have
just
seen
monsieur
i
also
have
my
privileges
which
do
not
extend
to
giving
you
books
razors
or
pens
but
which
allow
me
to
invite
to
my
table
such
prisoners
as
i
choose
to
favor
always
supposing
that
it
is
a
favor
true
it
is
stipulated
that
i
shall
give
an
account
of
anything
which
is
spoken
against
the
government
but
by
preventing
my
guests
from
touching
on
politics
i
avoid
the
necessity
of
betraying
them
is
it
not
feared
monsieur
said
gaston
that
this
intimacy
between
you
and
your
prisoners
should
lead
to
indulgences
on
your
part
which
might
be
contrary
to
the
intentions
of
the
government
i
know
my
duty
monsieur
and
keep
within
its
strict
limits
i
receive
my
orders
from
the
court
and
my
guests
who
know
that
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
bear
me
no
ill
will
for
them
i
hope
you
will
do
the
same
the
precaution
was
not
unnecessary
said
gaston
for
doubtless
i
shall
not
long
be
left
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
pleasure
i
have
had
you
have
doubtless
some
protector
at
court
none
said
gaston
then
you
must
trust
to
chance
monsieur
i
have
never
found
it
propitious
the
more
reason
that
it
should
weary
of
persecuting
you
i
am
a
breton
and
bretons
trust
only
in
god
take
that
as
my
meaning
when
i
said
chance
gaston
retired
charmed
with
the
manners
and
attentions
of
de
launay
chapter
xxvii
how
the
night
passed
in
the
bastille
while
waiting
for
the
day
gaston
had
already
on
the
preceding
night
asked
for
a
light
and
been
told
that
it
was
against
the
rules
this
night
he
did
not
renew
the
request
but
went
quietly
to
bed
his
morning
visit
to
the
had
given
him
a
lesson
in
philosophy
thus
rather
from
youthful
carelessness
than
from
force
of
will
or
courage
he
slept
quietly
and
soundly
he
did
not
know
how
long
he
had
slept
when
he
was
awoke
by
the
sound
of
a
small
bell
which
seemed
to
be
in
his
room
although
he
could
see
neither
bell
nor
ringer
it
is
true
that
the
room
was
very
dark
even
by
day
and
doubly
so
at
that
hour
the
bell
however
continued
to
sound
distinctly
but
with
caution
as
though
it
were
afraid
of
being
heard
gaston
thought
the
sound
seemed
to
come
from
the
chimney
he
rose
and
approaching
it
gently
became
convinced
that
he
was
right
presently
he
heard
blows
struck
under
the
floor
on
which
he
stepped
at
regular
intervals
with
some
blunt
instrument
it
was
evident
that
these
were
signals
among
the
prisoners
gaston
went
to
the
window
to
raise
the
curtain
of
green
serge
which
intercepted
the
rays
of
the
moon
and
in
doing
so
he
perceived
an
object
hanging
at
the
end
of
a
string
and
swinging
before
the
bars
good
said
he
it
appears
that
i
shall
have
occupation
but
each
one
in
turn
regularity
above
all
things
let
us
see
what
the
bell
wants
that
was
the
first
gaston
returned
to
the
chimney
extended
his
hand
and
soon
felt
a
string
at
the
end
of
which
a
bell
was
hanging
he
pulled
but
it
resisted
good
said
a
voice
which
came
down
the
chimney
you
are
there
yes
said
gaston
what
do
you
want
parbleu
i
want
to
talk
very
well
said
the
chevalier
let
us
talk
are
you
not
de
chanlay
with
whom
i
had
the
pleasure
of
dining
exactly
so
monsieur
in
that
case
i
am
at
your
service
and
i
at
yours
then
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
the
state
of
the
bretagne
affairs
you
see
they
are
in
the
bastille
good
said
a
voice
whose
joyous
tone
gaston
could
hear
with
ease
pardon
me
said
gaston
but
what
interest
have
you
in
these
affairs
why
when
affairs
are
bad
in
bretagne
they
treat
us
well
and
when
they
prosper
we
are
treated
badly
thus
the
other
day
apropos
of
some
affair
i
do
not
know
what
which
they
pretended
was
connected
with
ours
we
were
all
put
in
the
dungeon
ah
diable
said
gaston
to
himself
if
you
do
not
know
i
do
then
he
added
aloud
well
then
monsieur
be
content
they
are
very
bad
and
that
is
perhaps
the
reason
why
we
had
the
pleasure
of
dining
together
eh
monsieur
are
you
compromised
i
fear
so
receive
my
excuses
i
beg
you
on
the
contrary
to
accept
mine
but
i
have
a
neighbor
below
who
is
becoming
impatient
and
who
is
striking
hard
enough
to
break
the
boards
of
my
floor
permit
me
to
reply
to
him
do
so
monsieur
if
my
topographical
calculations
are
correct
it
must
be
the
marquis
de
pompadour
it
will
be
difficult
to
ascertain
not
so
difficult
as
you
suppose
how
so
does
he
not
strike
in
a
peculiar
manner
yes
has
it
a
meaning
certainly
it
is
our
method
of
talking
without
direct
communication
have
the
kindness
to
give
me
the
key
to
the
vocabulary
it
is
not
difficult
every
letter
has
a
rank
in
the
alphabet
decidedly
there
are
letters
i
have
never
counted
them
but
no
doubt
you
are
right
well
one
blow
for
a
two
for
b
three
for
c
and
so
on
i
understand
but
this
method
of
communication
must
be
somewhat
lengthy
and
i
see
a
string
at
my
window
which
is
getting
impatient
i
will
strike
a
blow
or
two
to
show
my
neighbor
that
i
have
heard
him
and
then
attend
to
the
string
go
monsieur
i
beg
for
if
i
am
not
mistaken
that
string
is
of
importance
to
me
but
first
strike
three
blows
on
the
floor
in
bastille
language
that
means
patience
the
prisoner
will
then
wait
for
a
new
signal
gaston
struck
three
blows
with
the
leg
of
his
chair
and
the
noise
ceased
he
then
went
to
the
window
it
was
not
easy
to
reach
the
bars
but
he
at
length
succeeded
in
doing
so
and
raising
the
string
which
was
gently
pulled
by
some
hand
as
a
sign
of
acknowledgment
gaston
drew
the
packet
which
would
scarcely
pass
the
bars
toward
him
it
contained
a
pot
of
sweetmeats
and
a
book
he
saw
that
there
was
something
written
on
the
paper
which
covered
the
pot
but
it
was
too
dark
to
read
it
the
string
vibrated
gently
to
show
that
an
answer
was
expected
and
gaston
remembering
his
neighbor
lesson
took
a
broom
which
he
saw
in
the
corner
and
struck
three
blows
on
the
ceiling
this
it
will
be
remembered
meant
patience
the
prisoner
withdrew
the
string
freed
from
its
burden
gaston
returned
to
the
chimney
eh
monsieur
said
he
all
right
what
is
it
i
have
just
received
by
means
of
a
string
a
pot
of
sweets
and
a
book
is
not
there
something
written
on
one
of
them
about
the
book
i
do
not
know
but
there
is
on
the
pot
unfortunately
it
is
too
dark
to
read
wait
said
the
voice
i
will
send
a
light
i
thought
lights
were
forbidden
yes
but
i
have
procured
one
well
then
send
it
for
i
am
as
impatient
as
you
to
know
what
is
written
to
me
and
gaston
feeling
cold
began
to
dress
himself
all
at
once
he
saw
a
light
in
his
chimney
the
bell
came
down
again
transformed
into
a
lantern
this
transformation
was
effected
in
the
most
simple
manner
the
bell
turned
upside
down
so
as
to
form
a
vessel
into
which
some
oil
had
been
poured
and
in
the
oil
burned
a
little
wick
gaston
found
this
so
ingenious
that
for
a
moment
he
forgot
both
the
pot
and
the
book
monsieur
said
he
to
his
neighbor
may
i
without
indiscretion
ask
you
how
you
procured
the
different
objects
with
which
you
fabricated
this
lamp
nothing
more
simple
monsieur
i
asked
for
a
bell
which
was
given
me
then
i
saved
some
oil
from
my
breakfasts
and
dinners
till
i
had
a
bottle
full
i
made
wicks
by
unraveling
one
of
my
handkerchiefs
i
picked
up
a
pebble
when
i
was
walking
in
the
yard
i
made
some
tinder
with
burned
linen
i
stole
some
matches
when
i
dined
at
the
governor
then
i
struck
a
light
with
a
knife
which
i
possess
and
with
the
aid
of
which
i
made
the
hole
through
which
we
correspond
receive
my
compliments
monsieur
you
are
a
man
of
great
invention
thank
you
monsieur
will
you
now
see
what
book
has
been
sent
you
and
what
is
written
on
the
paper
of
the
pot
of
sweetmeats
monsieur
the
book
is
a
virgil
that
is
it
she
promised
it
to
me
cried
the
voice
in
an
accent
of
happiness
which
surprised
the
chevalier
who
could
not
understand
that
a
virgil
should
be
so
impatiently
expected
now
said
the
prisoner
with
the
bell
pass
on
i
beg
to
the
pot
of
sweetmeats
willingly
said
gaston
and
he
read
monsieur
le
chevalier
i
hear
from
the
lieutenant
of
the
prison
that
you
occupy
the
room
on
the
first
floor
which
has
a
window
immediately
below
mine
prisoners
should
aid
and
help
each
other
eat
the
sweetmeats
and
pass
the
virgil
up
to
the
chevalier
dumesnil
whose
chimney
looks
into
the
court
that
is
what
is
expected
said
the
prisoner
with
the
bell
i
was
told
at
dinner
that
i
should
receive
this
message
then
you
are
the
chevalier
dumesnil
yes
monsieur
and
your
humble
servant
i
am
yours
replied
gaston
i
have
to
thank
you
for
a
pot
of
sweetmeats
and
i
shall
not
forget
my
obligation
in
that
case
monsieur
replied
the
prisoner
have
the
kindness
to
detach
the
bell
and
fasten
on
the
virgil
instead
but
if
you
have
not
the
light
you
can
not
read
oh
i
will
make
another
lantern
gaston
who
trusted
to
his
neighbor
ingenuity
after
the
proofs
he
had
had
of
it
made
no
further
difficulties
he
took
the
bell
which
he
placed
in
the
neck
of
an
empty
bottle
and
fastened
on
the
virgil
conscientiously
replacing
a
letter
which
fell
from
between
the
leaves
thank
you
monsieur
said
dumesnil
and
now
if
you
will
reply
to
your
neighbor
below
you
give
me
liberty
yes
monsieur
though
presently
i
shall
make
an
appeal
to
your
good
nature
at
your
orders
monsieur
you
say
then
that
for
the
letters
one
blow
for
for
z
thank
you
the
chevalier
struck
a
blow
with
the
handle
of
the
broom
to
give
notice
to
his
neighbor
that
he
was
ready
to
enter
into
conversation
with
him
it
was
instantly
answered
by
another
blow
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
the
prisoners
had
succeeded
in
saying
this
monsieur
what
is
your
name
thank
you
monsieur
i
am
the
chevalier
gaston
de
chanlay
and
i
the
marquis
de
pompadour
at
this
moment
gaston
looking
toward
the
windows
saw
the
string
shaking
convulsively
he
struck
three
blows
to
ask
for
patience
and
returned
to
the
chimney
monsieur
said
he
to
dumesnil
i
beg
you
to
remember
that
the
string
at
the
window
seems
prodigiously
ennuyé
beg
her
to
have
patience
i
will
attend
to
her
presently
gaston
renewed
the
signal
for
patience
on
the
ceiling
and
then
returned
to
the
chimney
and
the
virgil
soon
returned
monsieur
said
dumesnil
have
the
goodness
to
fasten
the
virgil
to
the
string
that
is
what
she
wants
gaston
had
the
curiosity
to
see
if
dumesnil
had
replied
to
mademoiselle
de
launay
he
opened
the
virgil
there
was
no
letter
but
some
words
were
underlined
in
pencil
and
gaston
read
meos
amores
and
carceris
oblivia
longa
he
understood
this
method
of
correspondence
which
consisted
in
underlining
words
which
placed
together
made
sense
ah
said
gaston
fastening
the
book
to
the
string
it
seems
that
i
have
become
the
postman
then
he
sighed
deeply
remembering
that
he
had
no
means
of
corresponding
with
helene
and
that
she
was
entirely
ignorant
what
had
become
of
him
this
gave
him
sympathy
for
the
attachment
of
mademoiselle
de
launay
and
the
chevalier
dumesnil
he
returned
to
the
chimney
monsieur
said
he
your
letter
is
dispatched
a
thousand
thanks
chevalier
now
a
word
more
and
i
will
leave
you
to
sleep
in
peace
oh
say
whatever
you
wish
monsieur
have
you
spoken
with
the
prisoner
below
yes
who
is
he
the
marquis
de
pompadour
i
thought
so
what
did
he
say
and
asked
who
i
was
he
had
no
time
to
ask
more
the
method
of
communication
is
not
as
expeditious
as
it
is
ingenious
you
must
make
a
hole
and
then
you
can
talk
as
we
do
what
with
i
will
lend
you
my
knife
thank
you
it
will
serve
to
amuse
you
at
least
give
it
me
here
it
is
and
the
knife
fell
at
gaston
feet
now
shall
i
send
back
the
bell
yes
for
my
jailers
might
miss
it
morning
and
you
do
not
want
light
for
your
conversation
with
pompadour
no
certainly
not
and
the
bell
was
drawn
up
now
said
the
chevalier
you
must
have
something
to
drink
with
your
sweets
and
i
will
send
you
a
bottle
of
champagne
thank
you
said
gaston
do
not
deprive
yourself
of
it
i
do
not
care
much
for
it
then
when
you
have
made
the
hole
you
shall
pass
it
to
pompadour
who
is
of
a
very
different
opinion
stay
here
it
is
thank
you
chevalier
and
the
string
ascended
gaston
looked
for
the
string
at
the
window
and
saw
that
it
had
disappeared
ah
sighed
he
the
bastille
would
be
a
palace
for
me
if
my
poor
helene
were
in
mademoiselle
de
launay
place
then
he
resumed
a
conversation
with
pompadour
which
lasted
till
three
in
the
morning
and
in
which
he
told
him
that
he
was
going
to
pierce
a
hole
that
they
might
have
more
direct
communication
chapter
xxviii
a
companion
in
the
bastille
thus
occupied
gaston
was
more
uneasy
than
ennuyé
besides
he
found
another
source
of
amusement
mademoiselle
de
launay
who
obtained
whatever
she
liked
from
the
lieutenant
provided
her
request
were
only
accompanied
by
a
sweet
smile
obtained
paper
and
pens
she
had
sent
some
to
dumesnil
who
had
shared
them
with
gaston
with
whom
he
still
communicated
and
with
richelieu
with
whom
also
he
managed
to
correspond
then
gaston
formed
the
idea
of
making
some
verses
to
helene
on
his
part
the
chevalier
dumesnil
made
some
for
mademoiselle
de
launay
who
made
them
in
return
for
him
so
that
the
bastille
was
a
true
parnassus
there
was
only
richelieu
who
dishonored
the
society
by
writing
prose
time
passed
as
it
will
pass
even
in
the
bastille
gaston
was
asked
if
he
would
like
to
attend
mass
and
as
he
was
deeply
religious
he
had
assented
most
gladly
the
next
day
they
came
to
fetch
him
the
mass
was
celebrated
in
a
little
church
having
instead
of
chapels
separate
closets
with
windows
into
the
choir
so
that
they
could
only
see
the
officiating
priest
at
the
moment
of
elevation
and
he
could
not
see
the
prisoners
at
all
gaston
saw
de
laval
and
the
duc
de
richelieu
who
had
apparently
come
to
mass
for
the
purpose
of
talking
for
they
knelt
side
by
side
and
kept
up
an
incessant
whispering
monsieur
de
laval
appeared
to
have
some
important
news
to
communicate
and
kept
looking
at
gaston
as
though
he
were
interested
in
it
as
neither
spoke
to
him
however
except
in
the
way
of
mere
salutation
he
asked
no
questions
when
the
mass
was
over
the
prisoners
were
taken
back
as
they
crossed
a
dark
corridor
gaston
passed
a
man
who
seemed
to
be
an
employé
of
the
house
this
man
sought
gaston
hand
and
slipped
a
paper
into
it
which
he
put
quietly
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
when
he
was
alone
in
his
own
room
he
eagerly
took
it
out
it
was
written
on
sugar
paper
with
the
point
of
a
sharpened
coal
and
contained
this
line
feign
illness
from
ennui
it
seemed
to
gaston
that
the
writing
was
not
unknown
to
him
but
it
was
so
roughly
traced
that
it
was
difficult
to
recognize
he
waited
for
the
evening
impatiently
that
he
might
consult
with
the
chevalier
dumesnil
at
night
gaston
told
him
what
had
passed
asking
him
as
he
had
a
longer
acquaintance
with
the
bastille
what
he
thought
of
the
advice
of
his
unknown
correspondent
ma
foi
though
i
do
not
understand
the
advice
i
should
follow
it
for
it
can
not
hurt
you
the
worse
that
can
happen
is
that
they
may
give
you
less
to
eat
but
said
gaston
suppose
they
discover
the
illness
to
be
feigned
oh
as
to
that
replied
dumesnil
the
doctor
is
entirely
ignorant
and
will
give
you
whatever
you
may
ask
for
perhaps
they
will
let
you
walk
in
the
garden
and
that
would
be
a
great
amusement
gaston
consulted
mademoiselle
de
launay
whose
advice
by
logic
or
sympathy
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
chevalier
but
she
added
if
they
diet
you
let
me
know
and
i
will
send
you
chicken
sweets
and
bordeaux
pompadour
did
not
reply
the
hole
was
not
yet
pierced
gaston
then
played
the
sick
man
did
not
eat
what
they
sent
him
relying
on
his
neighbor
liberality
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
de
launay
appeared
he
had
been
told
that
gaston
was
eating
nothing
and
he
found
the
prisoner
in
bed
monsieur
he
said
i
fear
you
are
suffering
and
have
come
to
see
you
you
are
too
good
monsieur
said
gaston
it
is
true
that
i
am
suffering
what
is
the
matter
ma
foi
monsieur
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
any
amour
propre
here
i
am
ennuyé
in
this
place
what
in
four
or
five
days
from
the
first
hour
what
kind
of
ennui
do
you
feel
are
there
several
certainly
one
pines
for
his
family
i
have
none
for
his
mistress
gaston
sighed
for
one
country
yes
said
gaston
it
is
that
seeing
that
he
must
say
something
the
governor
appeared
to
reflect
monsieur
said
he
since
i
have
been
governor
of
the
bastille
my
only
agreeable
moments
have
been
those
in
which
i
have
been
of
service
to
the
gentlemen
confided
to
my
care
by
the
king
i
am
ready
to
do
anything
for
you
if
you
will
promise
to
be
reasonable
i
promise
you
monsieur
i
can
put
you
in
communication
with
one
of
your
compatriots
or
at
least
with
a
man
who
seems
to
know
bretagne
perfectly
is
he
a
prisoner
like
yourself
a
vague
sentiment
passed
through
gaston
mind
that
it
must
be
this
man
who
had
slipped
the
note
into
his
hand
i
should
be
very
grateful
if
you
would
do
this
said
he
well
you
shall
see
him
but
as
i
am
recommended
to
be
strict
with
him
you
can
only
remain
with
him
an
hour
and
as
he
may
not
quit
his
chamber
you
must
go
to
him
as
you
please
monsieur
said
gaston
then
it
is
decided
at
five
expect
me
or
the
major
but
it
is
on
one
condition
what
is
it
that
in
consideration
of
this
distraction
you
will
eat
a
little
i
will
try
gaston
eat
a
little
chicken
and
drank
a
little
wine
to
keep
his
promise
in
the
evening
he
told
dumesnil
what
had
passed
ma
foi
said
he
you
are
lucky
the
count
de
laval
had
the
same
idea
and
all
he
got
was
to
be
put
into
a
room
in
the
tower
du
tresor
where
he
said
he
was
dreadfully
dull
and
had
no
amusement
but
speaking
to
the
prison
apothecary
diable
said
gaston
why
did
you
not
tell
me
that
before
i
had
forgotten
it
this
tardy
recollection
troubled
gaston
somewhat
placed
as
he
was
between
pompadour
dumesnil
and
mademoiselle
de
launay
his
position
was
tolerable
if
he
were
to
be
removed
he
would
be
really
attacked
by
the
malady
he
had
feigned
at
the
appointed
time
the
major
of
the
bastille
came
and
led
gaston
across
several
courts
and
they
stopped
at
the
tower
du
tresor
every
tower
had
its
separate
name
in
the
room
number
one
was
a
prisoner
asleep
on
a
folding
bed
with
his
back
turned
to
the
light
the
remains
of
his
dinner
were
by
him
on
a
wooden
table
and
his
costume
torn
in
many
places
indicated
a
man
of
low
station
ouais
said
gaston
did
they
think
that
i
was
so
fond
of
bretagne
that
any
fellows
who
happened
to
have
been
born
at
nismes
or
at
penmarch
may
be
raised
to
the
rank
of
my
pylades
no
this
fellow
is
too
ragged
and
seems
to
eat
too
much
but
as
one
must
not
be
too
capricious
in
prison
let
us
make
use
of
the
hour
i
will
recount
my
adventure
to
mademoiselle
de
launay
and
she
will
put
it
into
verse
for
the
chevalier
dumesnil
gaston
was
now
alone
with
the
prisoner
who
yawned
and
turned
in
his
bed
ugh
how
cold
it
is
in
this
cursed
bastille
said
he
rubbing
his
nose
that
voice
that
gesture
it
is
he
said
gaston
and
he
approached
the
bed
what
cried
the
prisoner
sitting
up
in
bed
and
looking
at
gaston
you
here
de
chanlay
captain
la
jonquiere
cried
gaston
myself
that
is
to
say
i
am
the
person
you
name
but
my
name
is
changed
to
what
first
tresor
what
first
tresor
it
is
a
custom
in
the
bastille
for
the
prisoner
to
take
the
name
of
his
room
that
saves
the
turnkey
the
trouble
of
remembering
names
however
if
the
bastille
be
full
and
two
or
three
prisoners
in
the
same
room
they
take
two
numbers
for
example
i
am
first
tresor
if
you
were
put
here
you
would
be
first
tresor
number
two
another
would
be
first
tresor
number
three
the
jailers
have
a
kind
of
latin
literature
for
this
yes
i
understand
said
gaston
watching
la
jonquiere
intently
then
you
are
a
prisoner
parbleu
you
see
for
yourself
i
presume
we
are
neither
of
us
here
for
pleasure
then
we
are
discovered
i
am
afraid
so
thanks
to
you
how
to
me
cried
la
jonquiere
feigning
surprise
no
jokes
i
beg
you
have
made
revelations
traitor
i
come
come
young
man
you
are
mad
you
ought
not
to
be
in
the
bastille
but
in
the
petites
maisons
do
not
deny
it
told
me
pardieu
the
authority
is
good
and
do
you
know
what
he
told
me
no
that
you
had
denounced
me
monsieur
well
what
then
are
we
to
cut
each
other
throats
because
the
police
has
followed
out
its
trade
and
lied
but
how
could
he
discover
i
ask
the
same
of
you
but
one
thing
is
certain
if
i
had
told
anything
i
should
not
be
here
you
have
not
seen
much
of
me
but
you
ought
to
know
that
i
should
not
be
fool
enough
to
give
information
gratis
revelations
are
bought
and
sold
monsieur
and
i
know
that
dubois
pays
high
for
them
perhaps
you
are
right
said
gaston
but
at
least
let
us
bless
the
chance
which
brings
us
together
certainly
you
do
not
appear
enchanted
nevertheless
i
am
only
moderately
so
i
confess
captain
ah
monsieur
how
you
are
i
yes
you
are
always
getting
angry
i
like
my
solitude
that
does
not
speak
monsieur
again
now
listen
do
you
believe
as
you
say
that
chance
has
brought
us
together
what
should
it
be
some
combination
of
our
jailers
of
or
perhaps
dubois
did
you
not
write
to
me
i
telling
me
to
feign
illness
from
ennui
and
how
should
i
have
written
on
what
by
whom
gaston
reflected
and
this
time
it
was
la
jonquiere
who
watched
him
then
said
the
captain
presently
i
think
on
the
contrary
that
it
is
to
you
we
owe
the
pleasure
of
meeting
in
the
bastille
to
me
monsieur
yes
chevalier
you
are
too
confiding
i
give
you
that
information
in
case
you
leave
here
but
more
particularly
in
case
you
remain
here
thank
you
have
you
noticed
if
you
were
followed
no
a
conspirator
should
never
look
before
but
always
behind
him
gaston
confessed
that
he
had
not
taken
this
precaution
and
the
duke
asked
la
jonquiere
is
he
arrested
i
know
not
i
was
going
to
ask
you
peste
that
is
disagreeable
you
took
a
young
woman
to
him
you
know
that
ah
my
dear
fellow
everything
becomes
known
did
not
she
give
the
information
ah
woman
woman
this
was
a
brave
girl
monsieur
i
would
answer
for
her
discretion
courage
and
devotion
yes
i
understand
we
love
her
so
she
is
honey
and
gold
what
an
idea
of
a
conspiracy
you
must
have
to
take
a
woman
to
the
chief
of
the
plot
but
i
told
her
nothing
and
she
could
know
no
secrets
of
mine
but
such
as
she
may
have
surprised
she
has
a
keen
eye
and
if
she
knew
my
projects
i
am
convinced
she
would
never
have
spoken
oh
monsieur
without
counting
her
natural
disposition
to
that
exercise
can
we
not
always
make
a
woman
speak
some
one
might
have
said
without
any
preparation
love
for
de
chanlay
will
lose
your
head
i
will
wager
that
she
will
speak
there
is
no
danger
she
loves
me
too
much
that
is
the
very
reason
pardieu
that
she
would
chatter
like
a
magpie
and
that
we
are
both
caged
up
however
let
us
drop
this
what
do
you
do
here
amuse
myself
amuse
yourself
how
with
making
verses
eating
sweets
and
making
holes
in
the
floor
holes
in
the
king
boards
said
la
jonquiere
oh
oh
that
is
good
to
know
does
not
de
launay
scold
he
does
not
know
it
besides
i
am
not
singular
everybody
makes
a
hole
in
something
one
his
floor
the
other
his
chimney
the
next
his
wall
do
you
not
make
holes
in
something
la
jonquiere
looked
to
see
if
gaston
were
not
laughing
at
him
but
now
monsieur
said
la
jonquiere
let
us
speak
seriously
are
you
condemned
to
death
i
yes
you
you
say
that
coolly
it
is
a
habit
in
the
bastille
there
are
twenty
here
condemned
to
death
and
not
a
bit
the
worse
for
it
i
have
been
interrogated
ah
you
see
but
i
do
not
believe
i
am
condemned
that
will
come
my
dear
captain
do
you
know
that
although
you
do
not
look
so
you
are
marvelously
merry
you
think
so
yes
does
it
astonish
you
i
did
not
know
you
were
so
brave
then
you
would
regret
life
i
confess
it
i
only
want
one
thing
to
make
me
happy
and
that
is
to
live
and
you
became
a
conspirator
with
a
chance
of
happiness
before
you
i
do
not
understand
you
i
thought
people
conspired
from
despair
as
they
marry
when
they
have
no
other
resource
when
i
joined
the
conspiracy
i
did
not
love
and
afterward
i
would
not
draw
back
bravo
that
is
what
i
call
character
have
you
been
tortured
no
but
i
had
a
narrow
escape
then
you
will
be
why
so
because
i
have
been
and
it
would
be
unfair
to
treat
us
differently
look
at
the
state
of
my
clothes
which
did
they
give
you
asked
gaston
shuddering
at
the
recollection
of
what
had
passed
between
and
himself
the
water
they
made
me
drink
a
barrel
and
a
half
my
stomach
was
like
a
bladder
i
did
not
think
i
could
have
held
so
much
and
did
you
suffer
much
asked
gaston
with
interest
yes
but
my
temperament
is
robust
the
next
day
i
thought
no
more
of
it
it
is
true
that
since
then
i
have
drunk
a
great
deal
of
wine
if
you
have
to
choose
select
the
water
it
cleans
all
the
mixtures
doctors
give
us
are
only
a
means
of
making
us
swallow
water
fangon
says
the
best
doctor
he
ever
heard
of
was
doctor
sangrado
he
only
existed
in
le
sage
brain
or
he
would
have
done
miracles
you
know
fangon
asked
gaston
surprised
by
reputation
besides
i
have
read
his
works
but
do
you
intend
to
persist
in
saying
nothing
doubtless
you
are
right
i
should
tell
you
if
you
regret
life
so
much
as
you
say
to
whisper
a
few
words
to
but
he
is
a
talker
who
would
reveal
your
confession
i
will
not
speak
be
assured
these
are
points
on
which
i
do
not
need
strengthening
i
believe
it
pardieu
you
seem
to
me
like
sardanapalus
in
your
tower
here
i
have
only
de
laval
who
takes
medicine
three
times
a
day
it
is
an
amusement
he
has
invented
well
tastes
differ
and
perhaps
he
wants
to
get
accustomed
to
the
water
but
did
you
not
say
i
should
certainly
be
condemned
do
you
wish
to
know
the
whole
truth
yes
well
told
me
that
you
were
gaston
turned
pale
in
spite
of
his
courage
la
jonquiere
remarked
it
however
said
he
i
believe
you
might
save
yourself
by
certain
revelations
why
do
you
think
i
should
do
what
you
refused
our
characters
and
our
positions
are
different
i
am
no
longer
young
i
am
not
in
love
i
do
not
leave
a
mistress
in
tears
gaston
sighed
you
see
there
is
a
great
difference
between
us
when
did
you
ever
hear
me
sigh
like
that
ah
if
i
die
his
excellency
will
take
care
of
helene
and
if
he
be
arrested
you
are
right
then
god
will
protect
her
decidedly
you
are
young
said
la
jonquiere
explain
suppose
his
excellency
be
not
arrested
well
what
age
is
he
or
six
i
suppose
and
if
he
fell
in
love
with
helene
is
not
that
her
name
the
duke
fall
in
love
with
her
he
to
whose
protection
i
confided
her
it
would
be
infamous
the
world
is
full
of
infamy
that
is
how
it
gets
on
oh
i
will
not
dwell
on
such
a
thought
i
do
not
tell
you
to
dwell
on
it
i
only
suggested
it
for
you
to
make
what
use
you
liked
of
hush
said
gaston
some
one
is
coming
have
you
asked
for
anything
no
then
the
time
allowed
for
your
visit
is
out
and
la
jonquiere
threw
himself
quickly
on
his
bed
the
bolts
creaked
the
door
opened
and
the
governor
appeared
well
monsieur
said
he
to
gaston
does
your
companion
suit
you
yes
particularly
as
i
know
captain
la
jonquiere
that
makes
my
task
more
delicate
but
however
i
made
you
an
offer
and
i
will
not
draw
back
i
will
permit
one
visit
daily
at
any
hour
you
please
shall
it
be
morning
or
evening
gaston
looked
at
la
jonquiere
say
five
in
the
evening
said
la
jonquiere
quickly
in
the
evening
at
five
if
you
please
the
same
as
then
yes
it
shall
be
as
you
desire
monsieur
gaston
and
la
jonquiere
exchanged
a
glance
and
the
chevalier
was
taken
back
to
his
chamber
chapter
xxix
the
sentence
it
was
six
and
quite
dark
the
chevalier
first
act
on
being
left
in
his
room
was
to
run
to
the
chimney
chevalier
said
he
dumesnil
replied
i
have
paid
my
visit
well
i
have
found
an
acquaintance
if
not
a
friend
a
new
prisoner
of
the
same
date
as
myself
his
name
captain
la
jonquiere
what
do
you
know
him
yes
then
do
me
a
favor
what
is
he
oh
an
enemy
of
the
regent
are
you
sure
quite
he
was
in
our
conspiracy
and
only
withdrew
because
we
preferred
abduction
to
assassination
then
he
was
for
assassination
that
is
it
murmured
gaston
he
is
a
man
to
be
trusted
if
it
be
the
same
i
mean
he
lives
in
the
rue
bourdonnais
at
the
muids
the
same
then
he
is
a
safe
man
that
is
well
said
gaston
for
he
holds
the
lives
of
four
brave
gentlemen
in
his
hands
of
whom
you
are
one
no
i
put
myself
aside
for
it
seems
all
is
over
with
me
how
all
is
over
yes
i
am
condemned
to
what
to
death
there
was
a
moment
silence
impossible
cried
the
chevalier
dumesnil
at
length
why
impossible
because
if
i
be
not
mistaken
your
affair
is
attached
to
ours
it
follows
on
it
well
well
our
affairs
prospering
yours
can
not
go
wrong
and
who
says
you
are
prospering
listen
for
with
you
i
will
have
no
secrets
i
am
listening
mademoiselle
de
launay
wrote
me
this
yesterday
she
was
walking
with
who
as
you
know
loves
her
and
at
whom
we
both
laugh
but
who
is
useful
to
us
on
pretext
of
illness
she
asked
as
you
did
for
a
doctor
he
told
her
that
the
prison
doctor
was
at
her
orders
i
must
tell
you
that
we
have
known
this
doctor
intimately
his
name
is
herment
however
she
did
not
hope
to
get
much
out
of
him
for
he
is
a
timid
man
but
when
he
entered
the
garden
where
she
was
walking
and
gave
her
a
consultation
in
the
open
air
he
said
to
her
in
the
mouth
of
any
one
else
this
would
have
been
nothing
in
his
it
was
a
vast
deal
since
are
told
to
hope
have
nothing
to
fear
as
our
affairs
are
intimately
connected
however
said
gaston
la
jonquiere
seemed
sure
of
what
he
said
at
this
moment
pompadour
knocked
gaston
went
to
the
hole
which
with
the
aid
of
his
knife
he
soon
made
practicable
ask
the
chevalier
dumesnil
if
he
does
not
know
anything
more
from
mademoiselle
de
launay
about
what
one
of
us
i
overheard
some
words
between
the
governor
and
the
major
at
my
door
they
were
to
death
gaston
shuddered
be
easy
marquis
i
believe
they
spoke
of
me
diable
that
would
not
make
me
easy
at
all
firstly
because
we
have
quickly
become
friends
and
i
should
be
grieved
if
anything
were
to
happen
to
you
and
secondly
because
what
happened
to
you
might
well
happen
to
us
our
affairs
being
so
similar
and
you
believe
that
mademoiselle
de
launay
could
remove
your
doubts
yes
her
windows
look
on
the
arsenal
well
she
would
have
seen
if
there
were
anything
new
going
on
there
ah
she
is
striking
now
at
that
moment
mademoiselle
de
launay
struck
two
blows
which
meant
attention
gaston
replied
by
one
which
meant
that
he
was
listening
then
he
went
to
the
window
a
minute
after
the
string
appeared
with
a
letter
gaston
took
the
letter
and
went
to
the
hole
to
pompadour
well
said
the
marquis
a
letter
replied
gaston
what
does
she
say
i
can
not
see
but
i
will
send
it
to
dumesnil
who
will
read
it
make
haste
pardon
said
gaston
i
am
as
anxious
as
you
and
he
ran
to
the
chimney
the
string
he
cried
you
have
a
letter
yes
have
you
a
light
yes
lower
the
string
gaston
tied
on
the
letter
which
was
drawn
up
it
is
for
you
and
not
for
me
said
dumesnil
never
mind
read
it
and
tell
me
what
it
is
i
have
no
light
and
it
would
lose
time
to
send
me
one
illustration
mademoiselle
de
page
you
permit
me
certainly
a
moment
silence
well
said
gaston
diable
bad
news
is
it
not
judge
for
yourself
and
dumesnil
read
my
dear
neighbor
some
judge
extraordinary
has
arrived
at
the
arsenal
this
evening
i
recognized
livery
we
shall
know
more
soon
when
i
see
the
doctor
a
thousand
remembrances
to
dumesnil
that
is
what
la
jonquiere
told
me
it
is
i
that
am
condemned
bah
chevalier
said
dumesnil
you
are
too
easily
alarmed
not
at
all
i
know
well
what
to
think
and
then
hark
what
silence
some
one
is
coming
and
gaston
went
away
from
the
chimney
the
door
opened
and
the
major
and
lieutenant
with
four
soldiers
came
for
gaston
who
followed
them
i
am
lost
murmured
he
poor
helene
and
he
raised
his
head
with
the
intrepidity
of
a
brave
man
who
knowing
death
was
near
went
boldly
to
meet
it
monsieur
said
your
crime
has
been
examined
by
the
tribunal
of
which
i
am
the
president
in
the
preceding
sittings
you
were
permitted
to
defend
yourself
if
you
were
not
granted
advocates
it
was
not
with
the
intention
of
inquiring
your
defense
but
on
the
contrary
because
it
was
useless
to
give
you
the
extreme
indulgence
of
a
tribunal
charged
to
be
severe
i
do
not
understand
you
then
i
will
be
more
explicit
discussion
would
have
made
one
thing
evident
even
in
the
eyes
of
your
defenders
that
you
are
a
conspirator
and
an
assassin
how
could
you
suppose
that
with
these
points
established
indulgence
would
be
shown
you
but
here
you
are
before
us
every
facility
will
be
given
for
your
justification
if
you
ask
a
delay
you
shall
have
it
if
you
wish
researches
they
shall
be
made
if
you
speak
you
have
the
reply
and
it
will
not
be
refused
you
i
understand
and
thank
the
tribunal
for
this
kindness
replied
gaston
the
excuse
it
gives
me
for
the
absence
of
a
defender
seems
sufficient
i
have
not
to
defend
myself
then
you
do
not
wish
for
witnesses
delays
or
documents
i
wish
my
sentence
that
is
all
do
not
be
obstinate
chevalier
make
some
confessions
i
have
none
to
make
for
in
all
my
interrogatories
you
have
not
made
one
precise
accusation
and
you
wish
certainly
i
should
like
to
know
of
what
i
am
accused
i
will
tell
you
you
came
to
paris
appointed
by
the
republican
committee
of
nantes
to
assassinate
the
regent
you
were
referred
to
one
la
jonquiere
your
accomplice
now
condemned
with
you
gaston
felt
that
he
turned
pale
at
these
true
accusations
this
might
be
true
monsieur
said
he
but
you
could
not
know
it
a
man
who
wishes
to
commit
such
a
deed
does
not
confess
it
till
it
be
accomplished
no
but
his
accomplices
confess
for
him
that
is
to
say
that
la
jonquiere
denounces
me
i
do
not
refer
to
la
jonquiere
but
the
others
the
others
cried
gaston
are
there
then
others
arrested
beside
la
jonquiere
and
myself
yes
messieurs
de
pontcalec
de
talhouet
du
couëdic
and
de
montlouis
i
do
not
understand
said
gaston
with
a
vague
feeling
of
terror
not
for
himself
but
for
his
friends
what
do
you
not
understand
that
messieurs
de
pontcalec
de
talhouet
du
couëdic
and
de
montlouis
are
now
being
tried
at
nantes
arrested
cried
gaston
impossible
yes
said
you
thought
that
the
province
would
revolt
rather
than
allow
its
defenders
as
you
rebels
call
yourselves
to
be
arrested
well
the
province
has
said
nothing
the
province
has
gone
on
singing
laughing
and
dancing
and
is
already
asking
where
they
will
be
beheaded
in
order
to
hire
windows
i
do
not
believe
you
monsieur
said
gaston
coldly
give
me
that
portfolio
said
to
a
man
standing
behind
him
here
monsieur
continued
he
are
the
writs
of
arrest
do
you
doubt
their
authenticity
that
does
not
say
that
they
have
accused
me
they
told
all
we
wanted
to
know
and
your
culpability
is
the
result
in
that
case
if
they
have
told
all
you
want
to
know
you
have
no
need
of
my
confession
is
that
your
final
answer
yes
officer
read
the
sentence
the
officer
read
as
the
result
of
the
investigation
commenced
on
the
of
february
that
gaston
de
chanlay
came
from
nantes
to
paris
with
the
intention
of
committing
the
crime
of
murder
on
the
person
of
his
royal
highness
monseigneur
the
regent
of
france
which
was
to
have
been
followed
by
a
revolt
against
the
authority
of
the
king
the
extraordinary
commission
instituted
to
inquire
into
this
crime
has
adjudged
the
chevalier
gaston
de
chanlay
worthy
of
the
punishment
for
high
treason
the
person
of
the
regent
being
as
inviolable
as
that
of
the
king
in
consequence
we
ordain
that
the
chevalier
gaston
de
chanlay
be
degraded
from
all
his
titles
and
dignities
that
he
and
his
posterity
be
declared
ignoble
in
perpetuity
that
his
goods
be
confiscated
his
woods
cut
down
to
the
height
of
six
feet
from
the
ground
and
he
himself
beheaded
on
the
greve
or
wheresoever
it
shall
please
the
provost
to
appoint
saving
his
majesty
pardon
gaston
was
pale
but
still
as
marble
and
when
am
i
to
be
executed
asked
he
as
soon
as
it
may
please
his
majesty
gaston
felt
a
cloud
pass
before
his
eyes
and
his
ideas
became
confused
but
this
soon
vanished
and
the
serenity
of
his
bearing
returned
the
blood
rushed
back
to
his
cheeks
and
a
contemptuous
smile
settled
on
his
lips
it
is
well
monsieur
said
he
at
whatever
moment
his
majesty
order
may
arrive
it
will
find
me
prepared
but
i
wish
to
know
whether
i
may
not
see
some
persons
who
are
very
dear
to
me
before
i
die
and
i
wish
to
ask
a
favor
of
the
king
eyes
glistened
with
malignant
joy
monsieur
said
he
i
told
you
that
you
would
be
treated
with
indulgence
you
might
therefore
have
spoken
sooner
and
perhaps
his
highness
kindness
might
not
have
waited
for
a
prayer
you
mistake
me
monsieur
said
gaston
with
dignity
neither
his
majesty
honor
nor
mine
will
suffer
from
the
favor
which
i
shall
ask
what
would
you
ask
said
speak
and
i
will
tell
you
at
once
if
there
be
a
chance
of
your
request
being
granted
i
ask
first
that
my
titles
and
dignities
which
are
not
very
great
should
not
be
canceled
as
i
have
no
posterity
i
am
alone
in
the
world
my
name
only
survives
me
but
as
that
name
is
only
noble
and
not
illustrious
it
would
not
survive
long
this
is
quite
a
royal
favor
monsieur
his
majesty
alone
can
and
will
reply
is
that
all
you
wish
to
ask
no
i
have
another
request
to
make
but
i
do
not
know
to
whom
i
should
apply
first
to
me
monsieur
in
my
character
of
lieutenant
of
police
i
shall
see
if
i
can
grant
it
or
if
i
must
refer
it
to
his
majesty
well
then
monsieur
i
desire
to
see
mademoiselle
helene
de
chaverny
ward
of
his
excellency
the
duc
and
also
the
duke
himself
at
this
request
made
a
singular
gesture
which
gaston
interpreted
as
one
of
hesitation
monsieur
said
gaston
i
would
see
them
in
any
place
and
for
as
short
a
time
as
may
be
thought
advisable
you
shall
see
them
said
ah
monsieur
said
gaston
stepping
forward
as
though
to
take
his
hand
you
lay
me
under
the
greatest
obligation
on
one
condition
however
monsieur
what
is
it
there
is
no
condition
compatible
with
my
honor
that
i
will
not
accept
in
exchange
for
so
great
a
favor
you
must
tell
no
one
of
your
condemnation
and
this
on
your
word
as
a
gentleman
i
accede
to
that
all
the
more
willingly
said
gaston
as
one
of
the
persons
named
would
certainly
die
if
she
knew
of
it
then
all
is
well
have
you
anything
further
to
say
nothing
monsieur
except
to
beg
that
you
will
record
my
denials
they
are
already
firmly
attached
officer
hand
the
papers
to
monsieur
de
chanlay
that
he
may
read
and
sign
them
gaston
sat
down
by
a
table
and
while
and
the
judges
chatted
around
him
he
carefully
perused
the
papers
and
the
report
of
his
own
answers
to
the
interrogatory
then
finding
all
correct
he
signed
monsieur
said
he
here
are
the
documents
shall
i
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
i
do
not
think
so
said
with
that
brutality
which
was
the
terror
of
those
who
were
subjected
to
him
then
to
our
meeting
in
another
world
monsieur
the
major
led
gaston
to
his
own
room
chapter
xxx
the
family
feud
when
gaston
returned
to
his
room
he
was
obliged
to
answer
the
questions
of
dumesnil
and
pompadour
who
were
waiting
to
hear
news
from
him
but
in
compliance
with
his
promise
made
to
he
did
not
mention
his
sentence
but
simply
announced
a
severer
interrogatory
than
before
but
as
he
wished
to
write
some
letters
he
asked
dumesnil
for
a
light
dumesnil
sent
him
a
candle
things
were
progressing
it
may
be
remarked
could
refuse
nothing
to
mademoiselle
de
launay
and
she
shared
all
with
dumesnil
who
in
his
turn
again
shared
with
his
neighbors
gaston
and
richelieu
gaston
doubted
whether
in
spite
of
promise
he
would
be
allowed
to
see
helene
but
he
knew
that
at
least
he
should
see
a
priest
before
he
died
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
priest
would
forward
two
letters
for
him
as
he
began
to
write
mademoiselle
de
launay
made
a
signal
that
she
had
something
to
send
him
it
was
a
letter
gaston
read
our
friend
for
you
are
our
friend
and
now
we
have
no
secrets
from
you
tell
dumesnil
of
the
famous
hope
i
conceived
after
the
word
that
herment
said
to
me
gaston
heart
beat
might
not
he
also
find
in
this
letter
some
ground
for
hope
had
they
not
said
that
his
fate
could
not
be
separated
from
the
others
it
is
true
that
those
who
had
said
so
did
not
know
of
his
conspiracy
he
read
on
an
hour
ago
the
doctor
came
accompanied
by
from
the
latter
manner
i
drew
the
most
favorable
augury
however
when
i
asked
to
speak
in
private
or
at
least
to
whisper
to
the
doctor
he
made
some
difficulties
which
i
removed
with
a
smile
least
said
he
one
must
know
that
i
am
out
of
hearing
i
should
lose
my
place
if
it
were
known
how
weak
i
am
this
tone
of
love
and
interest
combined
seemed
to
me
so
grotesque
that
i
laughingly
promised
him
what
he
asked
you
see
how
i
keep
my
promise
he
went
to
a
distance
and
herment
approached
then
commenced
a
dialogue
wherein
the
gestures
meant
one
thing
while
the
voice
declared
another
have
good
friends
said
herment
in
good
places
who
are
greatly
interested
for
you
i
naturally
thought
of
madame
de
maine
monsieur
i
cried
you
anything
for
me
said
herment
judge
how
my
heart
beat
gaston
felt
his
own
beating
vigorously
what
have
you
to
give
me
nothing
myself
but
you
will
have
the
object
agreed
upon
what
is
the
object
speak
beds
in
the
bastille
are
known
to
be
bad
and
particularly
badly
covered
and
i
am
commissioned
to
offer
you
coverlet
i
burst
out
laughing
the
devotion
of
my
friends
was
shown
in
preventing
my
catching
cold
dear
monsieur
herment
said
i
my
present
position
it
would
be
better
if
my
friends
were
to
occupy
themselves
less
about
my
feet
and
more
about
my
head
is
a
female
friend
said
he
is
it
de
charolais
said
herment
lowering
his
voice
so
that
i
could
scarcely
hear
him
then
he
withdrew
i
my
dear
chevalier
am
now
waiting
for
mademoiselle
de
charolais
coverlet
tell
this
to
dumesnil
it
will
make
him
laugh
gaston
sighed
the
gayety
of
those
around
him
weighed
heavily
on
his
heart
it
was
a
new
torture
which
they
had
invented
in
forbidding
him
to
confide
his
fate
to
any
one
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
should
have
found
consolation
in
the
tears
of
his
two
neighbors
he
had
not
the
courage
to
read
the
letter
to
dumesnil
so
he
passed
it
on
to
him
and
a
moment
after
heard
shouts
of
laughter
at
this
moment
gaston
was
saying
adieu
to
helene
after
passing
a
part
of
the
night
in
writing
he
slept
at
one
must
sleep
even
if
it
be
just
before
death
in
the
morning
gaston
breakfast
was
brought
at
the
usual
hour
but
he
remarked
that
it
was
more
than
usual
he
smiled
at
this
attention
and
as
he
was
finishing
the
governor
entered
gaston
with
a
rapid
glance
interrogated
his
expression
which
was
calm
and
courteous
as
ever
was
he
also
ignorant
of
the
sentence
or
was
he
wearing
a
mask
monsieur
said
he
will
you
take
the
trouble
to
descend
to
the
gaston
rose
he
seemed
to
hear
a
buzzing
in
his
ears
for
to
a
man
condemned
to
death
every
injunction
which
he
does
not
understand
is
a
torture
may
i
know
the
reason
monsieur
asked
gaston
in
so
calm
a
tone
that
it
was
impossible
to
detect
his
real
emotion
to
receive
a
visit
replied
the
governor
yesterday
after
the
interrogatory
did
you
not
ask
the
lieutenant
of
police
to
be
allowed
to
see
some
one
gaston
started
and
is
it
that
person
asked
he
yes
monsieur
gaston
had
asked
for
two
persons
the
governor
only
announced
one
which
one
was
it
he
had
not
the
courage
to
ask
and
silently
followed
the
governor
de
launay
led
gaston
to
the
on
entering
he
cast
an
eager
glance
around
but
the
room
was
empty
remain
here
monsieur
the
person
whom
you
expect
is
coming
said
the
governor
who
bowed
and
went
out
gaston
ran
to
the
window
which
was
barred
and
looked
out
there
was
a
sentinel
before
it
the
door
opened
and
gaston
turning
round
faced
the
duc
ah
monsieur
cried
he
how
good
of
you
to
come
at
the
request
of
a
poor
prisoner
it
was
a
duty
replied
the
duke
besides
i
had
to
thank
you
me
said
gaston
astonished
what
have
i
done
to
merit
your
excellency
thanks
you
have
been
interrogated
taken
to
the
given
to
understand
that
you
might
save
yourself
by
naming
your
accomplices
and
yet
you
kept
silence
i
made
an
engagement
and
kept
it
that
does
not
deserve
any
thanks
monseigneur
and
now
monsieur
tell
me
if
i
can
serve
you
in
anything
first
tell
me
about
yourself
have
you
been
molested
monseigneur
not
at
all
and
if
all
the
bretons
are
as
discreet
as
you
i
doubt
not
that
my
name
will
never
be
mentioned
in
these
unfortunate
debates
oh
i
will
answer
for
them
as
for
myself
monseigneur
but
can
you
answer
for
la
jonquiere
la
jonquiere
repeated
the
duke
yes
do
you
not
know
that
he
is
arrested
yes
i
heard
something
of
it
well
i
ask
you
monseigneur
what
you
think
of
him
i
can
tell
you
nothing
except
that
he
has
confidence
if
so
he
must
be
worthy
of
it
monseigneur
that
is
all
i
wished
to
know
then
come
to
the
request
you
had
to
make
have
you
seen
the
young
girl
i
brought
to
your
house
mademoiselle
helene
de
chaverny
yes
well
monsieur
i
had
not
time
to
tell
you
then
but
i
tell
you
now
that
i
have
loved
her
for
a
year
the
dream
of
that
year
has
been
to
consecrate
my
life
to
her
happiness
i
say
the
dream
monseigneur
for
on
awaking
i
saw
that
all
hope
of
happiness
was
denied
me
and
yet
to
give
this
young
girl
a
name
a
position
a
fortune
at
the
moment
of
my
arrest
she
was
about
to
become
my
wife
without
the
knowledge
of
her
parents
or
the
consent
of
her
family
cried
the
duke
she
had
neither
monseigneur
and
was
probably
about
to
be
sold
to
some
nobleman
when
she
left
the
person
who
had
been
set
to
watch
her
but
who
informed
you
that
mademoiselle
helene
de
chaverny
was
to
be
the
victim
of
a
shameful
bargain
what
she
herself
told
me
of
a
pretended
father
who
concealed
himself
of
diamonds
which
had
been
offered
to
her
then
do
you
know
where
i
found
her
monseigneur
in
one
of
those
houses
destined
to
the
pleasures
of
our
roués
she
an
angel
of
innocence
and
purity
in
short
monseigneur
this
young
girl
fled
with
me
in
spite
of
the
cries
of
her
duenna
in
broad
daylight
and
in
the
face
of
the
servants
who
surrounded
her
she
stayed
two
hours
alone
with
me
and
though
she
is
as
pure
as
on
the
day
when
she
received
her
mother
first
kiss
she
is
not
the
less
compromised
i
wish
this
projected
marriage
to
take
place
in
your
situation
monsieur
a
still
greater
reason
but
perhaps
you
may
deceive
yourself
as
to
the
punishment
reserved
for
you
it
is
probably
the
same
which
under
similar
circumstances
was
inflicted
on
the
count
de
chalais
the
marquis
de
and
the
chevalier
louis
de
rohan
then
you
are
prepared
even
for
death
monsieur
i
prepared
for
it
from
the
day
i
joined
the
conspiracy
the
conspirator
only
excuse
is
that
while
robbing
others
of
their
lives
he
risks
his
own
and
what
will
this
young
girl
gain
by
the
marriage
monseigneur
though
not
rich
i
have
some
fortune
she
is
poor
i
have
a
name
and
she
has
none
i
would
leave
her
my
name
and
fortune
and
with
that
intention
i
have
already
petitioned
the
king
that
my
goods
may
not
be
confiscated
nor
my
name
declared
infamous
were
it
known
for
what
reason
i
ask
this
it
would
doubtless
be
granted
if
i
die
without
making
her
my
wife
she
will
be
supposed
to
be
my
mistress
and
will
be
dishonored
lost
and
there
will
be
no
future
for
her
if
on
the
contrary
by
your
protection
or
that
of
your
friends
and
that
protection
i
earnestly
implore
we
are
united
no
one
can
reproach
her
the
blood
which
flows
for
a
political
offense
does
not
disgrace
a
family
no
shame
will
fall
on
my
widow
and
if
she
can
not
be
happy
she
will
at
least
be
independent
and
respected
this
is
the
favor
which
i
have
to
ask
monseigneur
is
it
in
your
power
to
obtain
it
for
me
the
duke
went
to
the
door
and
struck
three
blows
appeared
ask
de
launay
from
me
said
the
duke
whether
the
young
girl
who
is
at
the
door
in
my
carriage
may
come
in
her
visit
as
he
knows
is
authorized
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
conduct
her
here
what
monseigneur
helene
is
here
at
the
door
were
you
not
promised
that
she
should
come
yes
but
seeing
you
alone
i
lost
all
hope
i
wished
to
see
you
first
thinking
that
you
might
have
many
things
to
say
which
you
would
not
wish
her
to
hear
for
i
know
all
you
know
all
what
do
you
mean
i
know
that
you
were
taken
to
the
arsenal
yesterday
monseigneur
i
know
that
you
found
there
and
that
he
read
your
sentence
mon
dieu
i
know
that
you
are
condemned
to
death
and
that
you
were
bound
not
to
speak
of
it
to
any
one
oh
monseigneur
silence
one
word
of
this
would
kill
helene
be
easy
monsieur
but
let
us
see
is
there
no
way
of
avoiding
this
execution
days
would
be
necessary
to
prepare
and
execute
a
plan
of
escape
and
i
scarcely
have
hours
i
do
not
speak
of
escape
i
ask
if
you
have
no
excuse
to
give
for
your
crime
my
crime
cried
gaston
astonished
to
hear
his
accomplice
use
such
a
word
yes
replied
the
duke
you
know
that
men
stigmatize
murder
with
this
name
under
all
circumstances
but
posterity
often
judges
differently
and
sometimes
calls
it
a
grand
deed
i
have
no
excuse
to
give
monseigneur
except
that
i
believe
the
death
of
the
regent
to
be
necessary
to
the
salvation
of
france
yes
replied
the
duke
smiling
but
you
will
see
that
that
is
scarcely
the
excuse
to
offer
to
philippe
i
wanted
something
personal
political
enemy
of
the
regent
as
i
am
i
know
that
he
is
not
considered
a
bad
man
men
say
that
he
is
merciful
and
that
there
have
been
no
executions
during
his
reign
you
forget
count
horn
he
was
an
assassin
and
what
am
i
there
is
this
difference
count
horn
murdered
in
order
to
rob
i
neither
can
nor
will
ask
anything
of
the
regent
said
gaston
not
you
personally
i
know
but
your
friends
if
they
had
a
plausible
pretense
to
offer
perhaps
the
prince
himself
might
pardon
you
i
have
none
monseigneur
it
is
impossible
monsieur
permit
me
to
say
so
a
resolution
such
as
you
have
taken
must
proceed
from
a
sentiment
of
some
kind
either
of
hatred
or
vengeance
and
stay
i
remember
you
told
la
jonquiere
who
repeated
it
to
me
that
there
was
a
family
feud
tell
me
the
cause
it
is
useless
monseigneur
to
tire
you
with
that
it
would
not
interest
you
never
mind
tell
it
me
well
the
regent
killed
my
brother
the
regent
killed
your
brother
how
so
it
is
impossible
monsieur
de
gaston
said
the
duc
yes
killed
if
from
the
effect
we
go
to
the
cause
explain
yourself
how
could
the
regent
do
this
my
brother
who
being
fifteen
years
of
age
when
my
father
died
three
months
before
my
birth
stood
to
me
in
the
place
of
that
father
and
of
mother
who
died
when
i
was
still
in
the
cradle
my
brother
loved
a
young
girl
who
was
brought
up
in
a
convent
by
the
orders
of
the
prince
do
you
know
in
what
convent
no
i
only
know
that
it
was
at
paris
the
duke
murmured
some
words
which
gaston
could
not
hear
my
brother
a
relation
of
the
abbess
had
seen
this
young
girl
and
asked
her
hand
in
marriage
the
prince
consent
to
this
union
had
been
asked
and
he
made
a
pretense
of
granting
it
when
this
young
girl
seduced
by
her
protector
suddenly
disappeared
for
three
months
my
brother
hoped
to
find
her
but
all
his
searches
were
vain
he
found
no
trace
of
her
and
in
despair
he
sought
death
in
the
battle
of
ramillies
and
what
was
the
name
of
this
girl
no
one
ever
knew
monseigneur
to
speak
her
name
was
to
dishonor
it
it
was
doubtless
she
murmured
the
duke
it
was
helene
mother
and
your
brother
was
called
added
he
aloud
olivier
de
chanlay
monseigneur
olivier
de
chanlay
repeated
the
duke
in
a
low
voice
i
knew
the
name
of
de
chanlay
was
not
strange
to
me
then
aloud
continue
monsieur
i
listen
to
you
you
do
not
know
what
a
family
hatred
is
in
a
province
like
ours
i
had
lavished
upon
my
brother
all
the
love
which
would
have
fallen
to
the
share
of
my
father
and
mother
and
now
i
suddenly
found
myself
alone
in
the
world
i
grew
up
in
isolation
of
heart
and
in
the
hope
of
revenge
i
grew
up
among
people
who
were
constantly
repeating
was
the
duc
who
killed
your
brother
then
the
duke
became
regent
the
breton
league
was
therefore
organized
i
was
one
of
the
first
to
join
it
you
know
the
rest
you
see
that
there
is
nothing
in
all
this
which
has
any
interest
for
your
excellency
you
mistake
monsieur
unfortunately
the
regent
has
to
reproach
himself
with
many
such
faults
you
see
therefore
said
gaston
that
my
destiny
must
be
accomplished
and
that
i
can
ask
nothing
of
this
man
you
are
right
monsieur
whatever
is
done
must
be
done
without
you
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
appeared
well
monsieur
asked
the
duke
the
governor
has
an
order
from
the
lieutenant
of
police
to
admit
mademoiselle
helene
de
chaverny
shall
i
bring
her
here
monseigneur
said
gaston
looking
at
the
duke
with
an
air
of
entreaty
yes
monsieur
said
he
i
understand
grief
and
love
do
not
need
witnesses
i
will
come
back
to
fetch
mademoiselle
helene
the
permission
is
for
half
an
hour
said
then
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
will
return
said
the
duke
and
bowing
to
gaston
he
went
out
an
instant
after
the
door
opened
again
and
helene
appeared
trembling
and
questioning
but
he
retired
without
replying
helene
looked
round
and
saw
gaston
and
for
a
few
minutes
all
their
sorrows
were
forgotten
in
a
close
and
passionate
embrace
and
now
cried
helene
her
face
bathed
in
tears
well
and
now
asked
gaston
alas
to
see
you
here
in
prison
murmured
helene
with
an
air
of
terror
here
where
i
dare
not
speak
freely
where
we
may
be
watched
overheard
do
not
complain
helene
for
this
is
an
exception
in
our
favor
a
prisoner
is
never
allowed
to
press
one
who
is
dear
to
him
to
his
heart
the
visitor
generally
stands
against
that
wall
the
prisoner
against
this
a
soldier
is
placed
between
and
the
conversation
must
be
fixed
beforehand
to
whom
do
we
owe
this
favor
doubtless
to
the
regent
for
yesterday
when
i
asked
permission
of
monsieur
he
said
that
it
was
beyond
his
power
to
grant
and
that
he
must
refer
it
to
the
regent
but
now
that
i
see
you
again
gaston
tell
me
all
that
has
passed
in
this
age
of
tears
and
suffering
ah
tell
me
but
my
presentiments
did
not
deceive
me
you
were
conspiring
do
not
deny
it
i
know
it
yes
helene
you
know
that
we
bretons
are
constant
both
in
our
loves
and
our
hatreds
a
league
was
organized
in
bretagne
in
which
all
our
nobles
took
part
could
i
act
differently
from
my
brothers
i
ask
you
helene
could
i
or
ought
i
to
have
done
so
would
you
not
have
despised
me
if
when
you
had
seen
all
bretagne
under
arms
i
alone
had
been
inactive
a
whip
in
my
hand
while
others
held
the
sword
oh
yes
you
are
right
but
why
did
you
not
remain
in
bretagne
with
the
others
the
others
are
arrested
also
helene
then
you
have
been
denounced
betrayed
probably
but
sit
down
helene
now
that
we
are
alone
let
me
look
at
you
and
tell
you
that
you
are
beautiful
that
i
love
you
how
have
you
been
in
my
absence
has
the
duke
oh
if
you
only
knew
how
good
he
is
to
me
every
evening
he
comes
to
see
me
and
his
care
and
attention
and
said
gaston
who
thought
of
the
suggestion
of
the
false
la
jonquiere
nothing
suspicious
in
those
attentions
what
do
you
mean
gaston
that
the
duke
is
still
young
and
that
as
i
told
you
just
now
you
are
beautiful
oh
heaven
no
gaston
this
time
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
and
when
he
was
there
near
me
as
near
as
you
are
now
there
were
moments
when
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
found
my
father
poor
child
yes
by
a
strange
chance
for
which
i
can
not
account
there
is
a
resemblance
between
the
duke
voice
and
that
of
the
man
who
came
to
see
me
at
rambouillet
it
struck
me
at
once
you
think
so
said
gaston
in
an
abstracted
tone
what
are
you
thinking
of
gaston
asked
helene
you
seem
scarcely
to
hear
what
i
am
saying
to
you
helene
every
word
you
speak
goes
to
the
inmost
depth
of
my
heart
you
are
uneasy
i
understand
to
conspire
is
to
stake
your
life
but
be
easy
gaston
i
have
told
the
duke
that
if
you
die
i
shall
die
too
gaston
started
you
are
an
angel
said
he
oh
my
god
cried
poor
helene
how
horrible
to
know
that
the
man
i
love
runs
a
danger
all
the
more
terrible
for
being
uncertain
to
feel
that
i
am
powerless
to
aid
him
and
that
i
can
only
shed
tears
when
i
would
give
my
life
to
save
him
gaston
face
lit
up
with
a
flush
of
joy
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
ever
heard
such
words
from
the
lips
of
his
beloved
and
under
the
influence
of
an
idea
which
had
been
occupying
him
for
some
minutes
yes
dearest
said
he
taking
her
hand
you
can
do
much
for
me
what
can
i
do
you
can
become
my
wife
helene
started
i
your
wife
gaston
cried
she
yes
helene
this
plan
formed
in
our
liberty
may
be
executed
in
captivity
helene
my
wife
before
god
and
man
in
this
world
and
the
next
for
time
and
for
eternity
you
can
do
this
for
me
helene
and
am
i
not
right
in
saying
that
you
can
do
much
gaston
said
she
looking
at
him
fixedly
you
are
hiding
something
from
me
it
was
gaston
turn
to
start
now
i
said
he
what
should
i
conceal
from
you
you
told
me
you
saw
yesterday
well
what
then
well
gaston
said
helene
turning
pale
you
are
condemned
gaston
took
a
sudden
resolution
yes
said
he
i
am
condemned
to
exile
and
egotist
as
i
am
i
would
bind
you
to
me
by
indissoluble
ties
before
i
leave
france
is
that
the
truth
gaston
yes
have
you
the
courage
to
be
my
wife
helene
to
be
exiled
with
me
can
you
ask
it
gaston
said
she
her
eyes
lighted
with
enthusiasm
exile
i
thank
thee
my
god
i
who
would
have
accepted
an
eternal
prison
with
you
and
have
thought
myself
blessed
i
may
accompany
follow
you
oh
this
condemnation
is
indeed
a
joy
after
what
we
feared
gaston
gaston
at
length
we
shall
be
happy
yes
helene
said
gaston
with
an
effort
picture
my
happiness
cried
helene
to
me
france
is
the
country
where
you
are
your
love
is
the
only
country
i
desire
i
know
i
shall
have
to
teach
you
to
forget
bretagne
your
friends
and
your
dreams
of
the
future
but
i
will
love
you
so
that
it
will
be
easy
for
you
to
forget
them
gaston
could
do
nothing
but
cover
her
hands
with
kisses
is
the
place
of
your
exile
fixed
said
she
tell
me
when
do
you
go
shall
we
go
together
my
helene
replied
gaston
it
is
impossible
we
must
be
separated
for
a
time
i
shall
be
taken
to
the
frontier
of
france
i
do
not
as
yet
know
which
and
set
free
once
out
of
the
kingdom
you
shall
rejoin
me
oh
better
than
that
gaston
better
than
that
by
means
of
the
duke
i
will
discover
the
place
of
your
exile
and
instead
of
joining
you
there
i
will
be
there
to
meet
you
as
you
step
from
the
carriage
which
brings
you
you
shall
find
me
waiting
to
soften
the
pain
of
your
adieux
to
france
and
then
death
alone
is
irretrievable
later
the
king
may
pardon
you
later
still
and
the
action
punished
may
be
looked
upon
as
a
deed
to
be
rewarded
then
we
will
return
then
nothing
need
keep
us
from
bretagne
the
cradle
of
our
love
the
paradise
of
our
memories
oh
continued
she
in
an
accent
of
mingled
love
and
impatience
tell
me
gaston
that
you
share
my
hopes
that
you
are
content
that
you
are
happy
yes
helene
i
now
am
happy
indeed
for
now
and
only
now
i
know
by
what
an
angel
i
am
beloved
yes
dearest
one
hour
of
such
love
as
yours
and
then
death
would
be
better
than
a
whole
life
with
the
love
of
any
other
well
exclaimed
helene
her
whole
mind
and
soul
earnestly
fixed
on
the
new
future
which
was
opening
before
her
what
will
they
do
will
they
let
me
see
you
again
before
your
departure
when
and
how
shall
we
meet
next
shall
you
receive
my
letters
can
you
reply
to
them
what
hour
may
i
come
they
have
almost
promised
me
that
our
marriage
shall
take
place
this
evening
or
morning
what
here
in
a
prison
said
helene
shuddering
involuntarily
wherever
it
may
be
helene
it
will
bind
us
together
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
but
suppose
they
do
not
keep
their
promise
to
you
suppose
they
make
you
set
out
before
i
have
seen
you
alas
said
gaston
with
a
bursting
heart
that
is
possible
helene
and
it
is
that
i
dread
oh
mon
dieu
do
you
think
your
departure
is
so
near
you
know
helene
that
prisoners
are
not
their
own
masters
they
may
be
removed
at
any
moment
oh
let
them
come
let
them
come
the
sooner
you
are
free
the
sooner
we
shall
be
reunited
it
is
not
necessary
that
i
should
be
your
wife
in
order
to
follow
and
join
you
do
i
not
know
my
gaston
honor
and
from
this
day
i
look
upon
him
as
my
husband
before
god
oh
go
proudly
gaston
for
while
these
thick
and
gloomy
walls
surround
you
i
tremble
for
your
life
go
and
in
a
week
we
shall
be
reunited
reunited
with
no
separation
to
threaten
us
no
one
to
act
as
a
spy
on
us
reunited
forever
the
door
opened
great
heaven
already
said
helene
madame
said
the
lieutenant
the
time
has
elapsed
helene
said
gaston
seizing
the
young
girl
hand
with
a
nervous
trembling
which
he
could
not
master
what
is
it
cried
she
watching
him
with
terror
good
heaven
you
are
as
pale
as
marble
it
is
nothing
said
he
forcing
himself
to
be
calm
indeed
it
is
nothing
and
he
kissed
her
hand
till
gaston
yes
the
duke
appeared
at
the
door
gaston
ran
to
him
monseigneur
said
he
do
all
in
your
power
to
obtain
permission
for
her
to
become
my
wife
but
if
that
be
impossible
swear
to
me
that
she
shall
be
your
daughter
the
duke
pressed
gaston
hand
he
was
so
affected
that
he
could
not
speak
helene
approached
gaston
was
silent
fearing
she
might
overhear
he
held
out
his
hand
to
helene
who
presented
her
forehead
to
him
while
silent
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
gaston
closed
his
eyes
that
the
sight
of
her
tears
might
not
call
up
his
own
at
length
they
must
part
they
exchanged
one
last
lingering
glance
and
the
duke
pressed
gaston
hand
how
strange
was
this
sympathy
between
two
men
one
of
whom
had
come
so
far
for
the
sole
purpose
of
killing
the
other
the
door
closed
and
gaston
sank
down
on
a
seat
utterly
broken
and
exhausted
in
ten
minutes
the
governor
entered
he
came
to
conduct
gaston
back
to
his
own
room
gaston
followed
him
silently
and
when
asked
if
there
was
anything
he
wanted
he
mournfully
shook
his
head
at
night
mademoiselle
de
launay
signaled
that
she
had
something
to
communicate
gaston
opened
the
window
and
received
a
letter
inclosing
another
the
first
was
for
himself
he
read
dear
neighbor
the
coverlid
was
not
so
contemptible
as
i
supposed
it
contained
a
paper
on
which
was
written
the
word
already
spoken
by
herment
it
also
inclosed
this
letter
for
de
richelieu
send
it
to
dumesnil
who
will
pass
it
to
the
duke
your
servant
de
launay
alas
thought
gaston
they
will
miss
me
when
i
am
gone
and
he
called
dumesnil
to
whom
he
passed
the
letter
chapter
xxxi
state
affairs
and
family
affairs
on
leaving
the
bastille
the
duke
took
helene
home
promising
to
come
and
see
her
as
usual
in
the
evening
a
promise
which
helene
would
have
estimated
all
the
more
highly
if
she
had
known
that
his
highness
had
a
bal
masque
at
monceaux
on
the
palais
royal
the
duke
asked
for
dubois
and
was
told
he
was
in
his
study
working
the
duke
entered
without
allowing
himself
to
be
announced
dubois
was
so
busy
that
he
did
not
hear
the
duke
who
advanced
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
to
see
what
was
occupying
him
so
intently
he
was
writing
down
names
with
notes
by
the
side
of
each
what
are
you
doing
there
abbe
asked
the
regent
ah
monseigneur
it
is
you
pardon
i
did
not
hear
you
i
asked
what
you
were
doing
signing
the
burial
tickets
for
our
breton
friends
but
their
fate
is
not
yet
decided
and
the
sentence
of
the
commission
i
know
it
said
dubois
is
it
given
then
no
but
i
dictated
it
before
they
went
do
you
know
that
your
conduct
is
odious
truly
monseigneur
you
are
insupportable
manage
your
family
affairs
and
leave
state
affairs
to
me
family
affairs
ah
as
to
those
i
hope
you
are
satisfied
with
me
or
you
would
indeed
be
difficult
to
please
you
recommend
to
me
de
chanlay
and
on
your
recommendation
i
make
it
a
bastille
to
him
sumptuous
repasts
a
charming
governor
i
let
him
pierce
holes
in
your
floors
and
spoil
your
walls
all
which
will
cost
us
a
great
deal
to
repair
since
his
entrance
it
is
quite
a
fete
dumesnil
talks
all
day
through
his
chimney
mademoiselle
de
launay
fishes
with
a
line
through
her
window
pompadour
drinks
champagne
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
to
all
this
these
are
your
family
affairs
but
in
bretagne
you
have
nothing
to
see
and
i
forbid
you
to
look
monseigneur
unless
you
have
a
few
more
unknown
daughters
there
which
is
possible
dubois
scoundrel
ah
you
think
when
you
have
said
and
added
to
my
name
you
have
done
everything
well
scoundrel
as
much
as
you
please
meanwhile
but
for
the
scoundrel
you
would
have
been
assassinated
well
what
then
what
then
hear
the
statesman
well
then
i
should
be
hanged
perhaps
which
is
a
consideration
then
madame
de
maintenon
would
be
regent
of
france
what
a
joke
what
then
indeed
to
think
that
a
philosophic
prince
should
utter
such
naïvetés
oh
marcus
aurelius
was
it
not
he
who
said
esse
demum
felices
si
reges
philosophi
forent
aut
philosophi
reges
here
is
a
sample
dubois
still
wrote
on
dubois
you
do
not
know
this
young
man
what
young
man
the
chevalier
really
you
shall
present
him
to
me
when
he
is
your
that
will
be
dubois
the
abbe
looked
round
in
astonishment
and
looking
at
the
regent
with
his
little
eyes
as
wide
open
as
possible
ah
monseigneur
are
you
mad
he
said
no
but
he
is
an
honorable
man
and
you
know
that
they
are
rare
honorable
man
ah
you
have
a
strange
idea
of
honor
yes
i
believe
that
we
differ
in
our
ideas
of
it
what
has
this
honorable
man
done
has
he
poisoned
the
dagger
with
which
he
meant
to
assassinate
you
for
then
he
would
be
more
than
an
honorable
man
he
would
be
a
saint
we
have
already
jacques
clement
ravaillac
gaston
is
wanting
in
the
calendar
quick
quick
monseigneur
you
who
will
not
ask
the
pope
to
give
a
cardinal
hat
to
your
minister
ask
him
to
canonize
your
assassin
and
for
the
first
time
in
your
life
you
would
be
logical
dubois
i
tell
you
there
are
few
capable
of
doing
what
this
young
man
has
done
peste
that
is
lucky
if
there
were
ten
in
france
i
should
certainly
resign
i
do
not
speak
of
what
he
wished
to
do
but
of
what
he
has
done
well
what
has
he
done
i
should
like
to
be
edified
first
he
kept
his
oath
to
i
doubt
it
not
he
is
faithful
to
his
word
and
but
for
me
would
have
kept
his
word
also
with
pontcalec
talhouet
etc
yes
but
one
was
more
difficult
than
the
other
he
had
sworn
not
to
mention
his
sentence
to
any
one
and
he
did
not
speak
of
it
to
his
mistress
nor
to
you
he
spoke
of
it
to
me
because
i
told
him
that
i
knew
it
he
forbade
me
to
ask
anything
of
the
regent
desiring
he
said
but
one
favor
and
that
one
to
marry
helene
in
order
to
leave
her
a
fortune
and
a
name
good
he
wants
to
leave
your
daughter
a
fortune
and
a
name
he
is
polite
at
least
do
you
forget
that
this
is
a
secret
from
him
who
knows
dubois
i
do
not
know
in
what
your
hands
were
steeped
the
day
you
were
born
but
i
know
that
you
sully
everything
you
touch
except
conspirators
monseigneur
for
it
seems
to
me
that
there
on
the
contrary
i
purify
look
at
those
of
cellamare
how
all
that
affair
was
cleared
out
dubois
here
dubois
there
i
hope
the
apothecary
has
properly
purged
france
from
spain
well
it
shall
be
the
same
with
olivares
as
with
cellamare
there
is
now
only
bretagne
congested
a
good
dose
and
all
will
be
right
dubois
you
would
joke
with
the
gospel
pardieu
i
began
by
that
the
regent
rose
come
monseigneur
i
was
wrong
i
forgot
you
were
fasting
let
us
hear
the
end
of
this
story
the
end
is
that
i
promised
to
ask
this
favor
from
the
regent
and
that
the
regent
will
grant
it
the
regent
will
commit
a
folly
no
he
will
only
repair
a
fault
ah
now
you
find
you
have
a
reparation
to
make
to
de
chanlay
not
to
him
but
to
his
brother
still
better
what
have
you
done
to
his
brother
i
took
from
him
the
woman
he
loved
who
helene
mother
well
that
time
you
were
wrong
for
if
you
had
let
her
alone
we
should
not
have
had
all
this
tiresome
affair
on
our
hands
but
we
have
it
and
must
now
get
out
of
it
as
well
as
possible
just
what
i
am
working
at
and
when
is
the
marriage
to
take
place
in
the
chapel
of
the
palais
royal
you
shall
dress
in
the
costume
of
a
knight
of
the
order
you
shall
extend
both
hands
over
your
head
one
more
than
he
meant
to
have
held
over
you
it
will
be
very
affecting
no
abbe
it
shall
not
be
thus
they
shall
be
married
in
the
bastille
and
i
shall
be
in
the
chapel
where
they
can
not
see
me
well
monseigneur
i
should
like
to
be
with
you
i
should
like
to
see
the
ceremony
i
believe
these
kind
of
things
are
very
touching
no
you
would
be
in
the
way
and
your
ugly
face
would
betray
my
incognito
your
handsome
face
is
still
more
easy
to
recognize
monseigneur
said
dubois
bowing
there
are
portraits
of
henry
the
fourth
and
louis
the
fourteenth
in
the
bastille
you
flatter
me
are
you
going
away
monseigneur
yes
i
have
an
appointment
with
de
launay
the
governor
of
the
bastille
yes
go
monseigneur
go
shall
i
see
you
at
morceaux
perhaps
have
you
a
disguise
i
have
la
jonquière
dress
oh
that
is
only
fit
for
the
rue
du
bac
monseigneur
forgets
the
bastille
where
it
has
had
some
success
well
adieu
abbe
adieu
monseigneur
when
dubois
was
left
alone
he
appeared
to
take
some
sudden
resolution
he
rang
the
bell
and
a
servant
entered
de
launay
is
coming
to
the
regent
watch
him
and
bring
him
here
afterward
the
servant
retired
without
a
reply
and
dubois
resumed
his
work
half
an
hour
afterward
the
door
opened
and
the
servant
announced
de
launay
dubois
gave
him
a
note
read
that
said
he
i
give
you
written
instructions
that
there
may
be
no
pretext
for
neglecting
them
ah
monseigneur
said
de
launay
you
would
ruin
how
so
when
it
becomes
known
who
will
tell
it
will
you
no
but
monseigneur
will
be
enchanted
i
answer
for
him
a
governor
of
the
bastille
do
you
care
to
retain
the
title
certainly
then
do
as
i
tell
you
is
hard
however
to
close
one
eyes
and
ears
my
dear
de
launay
go
and
pay
a
visit
to
dumesnil
chimney
and
pompadour
ceiling
is
it
possible
you
tell
me
of
things
i
was
not
at
all
aware
of
a
proof
that
i
know
better
than
you
what
goes
on
in
the
bastille
and
if
i
were
to
speak
of
some
things
you
do
know
you
would
be
still
more
surprised
what
could
you
tell
me
that
a
week
ago
one
of
the
officers
of
the
bastille
and
an
important
one
too
received
fifty
thousand
francs
to
let
two
women
pass
with
monsieur
they
were
i
know
who
they
were
what
they
went
for
and
what
they
did
they
were
mademoiselle
de
valois
and
mademoiselle
de
charolais
they
went
to
see
the
duc
de
richelieu
and
they
eat
till
midnight
in
the
tour
du
coin
where
they
intend
to
pay
another
visit
as
they
have
already
announced
to
de
richelieu
de
launay
turned
pale
well
continued
dubois
do
you
think
if
i
told
these
kind
of
things
to
the
regent
who
is
as
you
know
greedy
of
scandal
that
a
certain
de
launay
would
be
long
governor
of
the
bastille
but
i
shall
not
say
a
word
for
we
must
help
each
other
i
am
at
your
orders
monsieur
then
i
shall
find
everything
ready
i
promise
you
but
not
a
word
to
monseigneur
that
is
right
de
launay
adieu
good
said
dubois
when
he
was
gone
and
now
monseigneur
when
you
want
to
marry
your
daughter
there
shall
be
only
one
thing
missing
your
as
gaston
passed
on
the
letter
to
dumesnil
he
heard
steps
in
the
corridor
and
hastily
signing
to
the
chevalier
not
to
speak
he
put
out
the
light
and
began
to
undress
the
governor
entered
as
it
was
not
his
custom
to
visit
his
prisoners
at
this
hour
gaston
saw
him
with
alarm
and
he
noticed
that
as
de
launay
placed
his
lamp
on
the
table
his
hand
trembled
the
turnkeys
withdrew
but
the
prisoner
saw
two
soldiers
at
the
door
chevalier
said
the
governor
you
told
me
to
treat
you
as
a
man
learn
that
you
were
condemned
yesterday
and
you
have
come
to
tell
me
said
gaston
who
always
gained
courage
in
the
face
of
danger
that
the
hour
of
my
execution
is
arrived
no
monsieur
but
it
approaches
when
will
it
be
may
i
tell
you
the
truth
chevalier
i
shall
be
most
grateful
to
you
at
break
of
day
where
in
the
yard
of
the
bastille
thank
you
i
had
hoped
however
that
before
i
died
i
might
have
been
the
husband
of
the
young
girl
who
was
here
yesterday
did
promise
you
this
no
but
he
promised
to
ask
the
king
the
king
may
have
refused
does
he
never
grant
such
favors
is
rare
monsieur
but
not
without
a
precedent
i
am
a
christian
said
gaston
i
hope
i
shall
be
allowed
a
confessor
he
is
here
may
i
see
him
directly
at
present
he
is
with
your
accomplice
my
accomplice
who
la
jonquiere
who
will
be
executed
with
you
and
i
had
suspected
him
said
gaston
chevalier
you
are
young
to
die
said
the
governor
death
does
not
count
years
god
bids
it
strike
and
it
obeys
but
if
one
can
avert
the
blow
it
is
almost
a
crime
not
to
do
so
what
do
you
mean
i
do
not
understand
i
told
you
that
gave
hopes
enough
monsieur
i
have
nothing
to
confess
at
this
moment
the
major
knocked
at
the
door
and
exchanged
some
words
with
the
governor
monsieur
said
the
latter
captain
la
jonquiere
wishes
to
see
you
once
more
and
you
refuse
it
said
gaston
with
a
slight
ironical
smile
on
the
contrary
i
grant
it
in
the
hope
that
he
will
be
more
reasonable
than
you
and
that
he
wishes
to
consult
you
as
to
making
confessions
if
that
be
his
intention
tell
him
i
refuse
to
come
i
know
nothing
of
it
monsieur
perhaps
he
only
wishes
once
again
to
see
his
companion
in
misfortune
in
that
case
monsieur
i
consent
follow
me
then
they
found
the
captain
lying
on
the
bed
with
his
clothes
in
rags
i
thought
the
almoner
of
the
bastille
was
with
you
said
de
launay
he
was
but
i
sent
him
away
why
so
because
i
do
not
like
jesuits
do
you
think
morbleu
that
i
can
not
die
properly
without
a
priest
to
die
properly
monsieur
is
not
to
die
bravely
but
as
a
christian
if
i
had
wanted
a
sermon
i
would
have
kept
the
priest
but
i
wanted
de
chanlay
he
is
here
monsieur
i
refuse
nothing
to
those
who
have
nothing
to
hope
ah
chevalier
are
you
there
said
la
jonquiere
turning
round
you
are
welcome
explain
said
gaston
i
see
with
sorrow
that
you
refuse
the
consolations
of
religion
you
also
if
you
say
another
word
i
declare
i
will
turn
huguenot
pardon
captain
but
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
advise
you
to
do
what
i
shall
do
myself
i
bear
you
no
chevalier
if
i
were
a
minister
i
would
proclaim
religious
liberty
now
de
launay
continued
he
you
understand
that
as
the
chevalier
and
i
are
about
to
undertake
a
long
journey
we
have
some
things
to
talk
over
together
first
i
will
retire
chevalier
you
have
an
hour
to
remain
here
thank
you
monsieur
said
gaston
well
said
the
captain
when
they
were
alone
well
said
gaston
you
were
right
yes
but
i
am
exactly
like
the
man
who
went
round
jerusalem
crying
out
for
seven
days
and
the
eighth
day
a
stone
thrown
from
the
walls
struck
him
and
killed
him
yes
i
know
that
we
are
to
die
together
which
annoys
you
a
little
does
it
not
very
much
for
i
had
reason
to
cling
to
life
every
one
has
but
i
above
all
then
i
only
know
one
way
make
revelations
never
no
but
fly
with
me
how
fly
with
you
yes
i
escape
but
do
you
know
that
our
execution
is
fixed
for
therefore
i
decamp
escape
do
you
say
certainly
how
where
open
the
window
well
shake
the
middle
bar
great
god
does
it
resist
no
it
yields
very
good
it
has
given
me
trouble
enough
heaven
knows
it
seems
like
a
dream
do
you
remember
asking
me
if
i
did
not
make
holes
in
anything
like
all
the
others
yes
but
you
replied
that
i
would
tell
you
another
time
was
the
answer
a
good
one
excellent
but
how
to
descend
help
me
in
what
to
search
my
paillasse
a
ladder
of
cord
exactly
but
how
did
you
get
it
i
received
it
with
a
file
in
a
lark
pie
the
day
of
my
arrival
certainly
you
are
decidedly
a
great
man
i
know
it
besides
that
i
am
a
good
man
for
i
might
escape
alone
and
you
have
thought
of
me
i
asked
for
you
saying
that
i
wished
to
say
adieu
to
you
i
knew
i
should
entice
them
to
do
some
act
of
stupidity
let
us
make
haste
captain
on
the
contrary
let
us
act
slowly
and
prudently
we
have
an
hour
before
us
and
the
sentinels
bah
it
is
dark
but
the
moat
which
is
full
of
water
it
is
frozen
but
the
wall
when
we
are
there
will
be
time
enough
to
think
about
that
must
we
fasten
the
ladder
i
want
to
try
if
it
be
solid
i
have
an
affection
for
my
spine
such
as
it
is
and
do
not
want
to
break
my
neck
to
save
it
from
another
fate
you
are
the
first
captain
of
the
day
la
jonquiere
bah
i
have
made
plenty
of
others
said
la
jonquiere
tying
the
last
knot
in
the
ladder
is
it
finished
asked
gaston
yes
shall
i
pass
first
as
you
like
i
like
it
so
go
then
is
it
high
fifteen
to
eighteen
feet
a
trifle
yes
for
you
who
are
young
but
it
is
a
different
affair
for
me
be
prudent
i
beg
do
not
be
afraid
gaston
went
first
slowly
and
prudently
followed
by
la
jonquiere
who
laughed
in
his
sleeve
and
grumbled
every
time
he
hurt
his
fingers
or
when
the
wind
shook
the
cords
a
nice
affair
for
the
successor
of
richelieu
and
mazarin
he
growled
to
himself
it
is
true
i
am
not
yet
a
cardinal
that
saves
me
gaston
touched
the
water
or
rather
ice
of
the
fosse
a
moment
after
la
jonquiere
was
by
his
side
now
follow
me
said
the
latter
on
the
other
side
of
the
moat
a
ladder
awaited
them
you
have
accomplices
then
parbleu
do
you
think
the
lark
paté
came
by
itself
who
says
one
can
not
escape
from
the
bastille
said
gaston
joyously
my
young
friend
said
dubois
stopping
on
the
third
step
take
my
advice
do
get
in
there
again
without
me
you
might
not
be
as
fortunate
the
second
time
as
the
first
they
continued
to
mount
the
wall
on
the
platform
of
which
a
sentinel
walked
but
instead
of
opposing
them
he
held
his
hand
to
la
jonquiere
to
assist
him
and
in
three
minutes
they
were
on
the
platform
had
drawn
up
the
ladder
and
placed
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
the
descent
was
as
safely
managed
and
they
found
themselves
on
another
frozen
moat
now
said
the
captain
we
must
take
away
the
ladder
that
we
may
not
compromise
the
poor
devil
who
helped
us
we
are
then
free
nearly
so
said
la
jonquiere
gaston
strengthened
by
this
news
took
up
the
ladder
on
his
shoulder
peste
chevalier
the
late
hercules
was
nothing
to
you
i
think
bah
said
gaston
at
this
moment
i
could
carry
the
bastille
itself
they
went
on
in
silence
to
a
lane
in
the
faubourg
antoine
the
streets
were
deserted
now
my
dear
chevalier
said
la
jonquiere
do
me
the
favor
to
follow
me
to
the
corner
of
the
faubourg
i
would
follow
you
to
not
so
far
if
you
please
for
safety
sake
we
will
each
go
our
own
way
what
carriage
is
that
mine
how
yours
yes
peste
my
dear
captain
four
horses
you
travel
like
a
prince
three
horses
one
is
for
you
how
you
consent
pardieu
that
is
not
all
what
you
have
no
money
it
was
taken
away
here
are
fifty
louis
but
captain
come
it
is
spanish
money
take
it
gaston
took
the
purse
while
a
postilion
unharnessed
a
horse
and
led
it
to
him
now
said
dubois
where
are
you
going
to
bretagne
to
rejoin
my
companions
you
are
mad
my
dear
fellow
they
are
all
condemned
and
may
be
executed
in
two
or
three
days
you
are
right
said
gaston
go
to
flanders
said
la
jonquiere
it
is
a
pleasant
country
in
fifteen
or
eighteen
hours
you
can
reach
the
frontier
yes
said
gaston
gloomily
thank
you
i
know
where
i
shall
go
well
good
luck
to
you
said
dubois
getting
into
his
carriage
the
same
to
you
said
gaston
they
grasped
each
other
hands
and
then
each
went
his
own
way
chapter
xxxii
showing
that
we
must
not
always
judge
others
by
ourselves
above
all
if
we
are
called
dubois
the
regent
as
usual
passed
the
evening
with
helene
he
had
not
missed
for
four
or
five
days
and
the
hours
he
passed
with
her
were
his
happy
hours
but
this
time
he
found
her
very
much
shaken
by
her
visit
to
her
lover
in
the
bastille
come
said
the
regent
take
courage
helene
you
shall
be
his
wife
is
distant
replied
she
helene
believe
in
my
word
which
has
never
failed
you
i
tell
you
that
shall
dawn
happily
for
you
and
for
him
helene
sighed
deeply
a
servant
entered
and
spoke
to
the
regent
what
is
it
asked
helene
who
was
alarmed
at
the
slightest
thing
nothing
my
child
said
the
duke
it
is
only
my
secretary
who
wishes
to
see
me
on
some
pressing
business
shall
i
leave
you
yes
do
me
that
favor
for
an
instant
helene
withdrew
into
her
room
at
the
same
time
the
door
opened
and
dubois
entered
out
of
breath
where
do
you
come
from
in
such
a
state
parbleu
from
the
bastille
and
our
prisoner
well
is
everything
arranged
for
the
marriage
yes
everything
but
the
hour
which
you
did
not
name
let
us
say
eight
in
the
morning
at
eight
in
the
morning
said
dubois
calculating
yes
what
are
you
calculating
i
am
thinking
where
he
will
be
who
the
prisoner
what
the
prisoner
yes
at
eight
he
will
be
forty
leagues
from
paris
from
paris
yes
if
he
continues
to
go
at
the
pace
at
which
i
saw
him
set
out
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
monseigneur
that
there
will
be
one
thing
only
wanting
at
the
marriage
the
husband
gaston
has
escaped
from
the
bastille
ago
you
lie
abbe
people
do
not
escape
from
the
bastille
i
beg
your
pardon
monseigneur
people
escape
from
any
place
when
they
are
condemned
to
death
he
escaped
knowing
that
he
was
to
wed
her
whom
he
loved
listen
monseigneur
life
is
a
charming
thing
and
we
all
cling
to
it
then
your
has
a
charming
head
which
he
wishes
to
keep
on
his
shoulders
what
more
natural
and
where
is
he
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
tell
you
evening
at
present
all
i
know
is
that
he
is
at
some
distance
and
that
i
will
answer
for
it
he
will
not
return
the
regent
became
deeply
thoughtful
really
monseigneur
your
naïveté
causes
me
perpetual
astonishment
you
must
be
strangely
ignorant
of
the
human
heart
if
you
suppose
that
a
man
condemned
to
death
would
remain
in
prison
when
he
had
a
chance
of
escape
oh
monsieur
de
chanlay
cried
the
regent
eh
mon
dieu
this
chevalier
has
acted
as
the
commonest
workman
would
have
done
and
quite
right
too
dubois
and
my
daughter
well
your
daughter
monseigneur
it
will
kill
her
said
the
regent
oh
no
monseigneur
not
at
all
when
she
finds
out
what
he
is
she
will
be
consoled
and
you
can
marry
her
to
some
small
german
or
italian
prince
to
the
duke
of
modena
for
instance
whom
mademoiselle
de
valois
will
not
have
dubois
and
i
meant
to
pardon
him
he
has
done
it
for
himself
monseigneur
thinking
it
safer
and
ma
foi
i
should
have
done
the
same
oh
you
you
are
not
noble
you
had
not
taken
an
oath
you
mistake
monseigneur
i
had
taken
an
oath
to
prevent
your
highness
from
committing
a
folly
and
i
have
succeeded
well
well
let
us
speak
of
it
no
more
not
a
word
of
this
before
helene
i
will
undertake
to
tell
her
and
i
to
get
back
your
no
no
he
has
escaped
let
him
profit
by
it
as
the
regent
spoke
these
words
a
noise
was
heard
in
the
neighboring
room
and
a
servant
entering
hurriedly
announced
monsieur
gaston
de
chanlay
dubois
turned
pale
as
death
and
his
face
assumed
an
expression
of
threatening
anger
the
regent
rose
in
a
transport
of
joy
which
brought
a
bright
color
into
his
face
there
was
as
much
pleasure
in
this
face
rendered
sublime
by
confidence
as
there
was
compressed
fury
in
dubois
sharp
and
malignant
countenance
illustration
the
page
let
him
enter
said
the
regent
at
least
give
me
time
to
go
said
dubois
ah
yes
he
would
recognize
you
dubois
retired
with
a
growling
noise
like
a
hyena
disturbed
in
its
feast
or
in
its
lair
he
entered
the
next
room
there
he
sat
down
by
a
table
on
which
was
every
material
for
writing
and
this
seemed
to
suggest
some
new
and
terrible
idea
for
his
face
suddenly
lighted
up
he
rang
send
for
the
portfolio
which
is
in
my
carriage
said
he
to
the
servant
who
appeared
this
order
being
executed
at
once
dubois
seized
some
papers
wrote
on
them
some
words
with
an
expression
of
sinister
joy
then
having
ordered
his
carriage
drove
to
the
palais
royal
meanwhile
the
chevalier
was
led
to
the
regent
and
walked
straight
up
to
him
how
you
here
monsieur
said
the
duke
trying
to
look
surprised
yes
monseigneur
a
miracle
has
been
worked
in
my
favor
by
la
jonquiere
he
had
prepared
all
for
flight
he
asked
for
me
under
pretense
of
consulting
me
as
to
confessions
then
when
we
were
alone
he
told
me
all
and
we
escaped
together
and
in
safety
and
instead
of
flying
monsieur
gaining
the
frontier
and
placing
yourself
in
safety
you
are
here
at
the
peril
of
your
life
monseigneur
said
gaston
blushing
i
must
confess
that
for
a
moment
liberty
seemed
to
me
the
most
precious
and
the
sweetest
thing
the
world
could
afford
the
first
breath
of
air
i
drew
seemed
to
intoxicate
me
but
i
soon
reflected
on
one
thing
monsieur
on
two
monseigneur
you
thought
of
helene
whom
you
were
abandoning
and
of
my
companions
whom
i
left
under
the
ax
and
then
you
decided
that
i
was
bound
to
their
cause
till
our
projects
were
accomplished
our
projects
yes
are
they
not
yours
as
well
as
mine
listen
monsieur
said
the
regent
i
believe
that
man
must
keep
within
the
limits
of
his
strength
there
are
things
which
god
seems
to
forbid
him
to
execute
there
are
warnings
which
tell
him
to
renounce
certain
projects
i
believe
that
it
is
sacrilege
to
despise
these
warnings
to
remain
deaf
to
this
voice
our
projects
have
miscarried
monsieur
let
us
think
no
more
of
them
on
the
contrary
monseigneur
said
gaston
sadly
shaking
his
head
let
us
think
of
them
more
than
ever
but
you
are
furious
monsieur
said
the
regent
to
persist
in
an
undertaking
which
has
now
become
so
difficult
that
it
is
almost
madness
i
think
monseigneur
of
our
friends
arrested
tried
condemned
told
me
so
of
our
friends
who
are
destined
to
the
scaffold
and
who
can
be
saved
only
by
the
death
of
the
regent
of
our
friends
who
would
say
if
i
were
to
leave
france
that
i
purchased
my
safety
by
their
ruin
and
that
the
gates
of
the
bastille
were
opened
by
my
revelations
then
monsieur
to
this
point
of
honor
you
sacrifice
everything
even
helene
monseigneur
if
they
be
still
alive
i
must
save
them
but
if
they
be
dead
then
it
is
another
thing
replied
gaston
then
i
must
revenge
them
really
monsieur
said
the
duke
this
seems
to
me
a
somewhat
exaggerated
idea
of
heroism
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
in
your
own
person
already
paid
your
share
believe
me
take
the
word
of
a
man
who
is
a
good
judge
in
affairs
of
honor
you
are
absolved
in
the
eyes
of
the
whole
world
my
dear
brutus
i
am
not
in
my
own
monseigneur
then
you
persist
more
than
ever
the
regent
must
die
and
added
he
in
a
hollow
voice
die
he
shall
but
do
you
not
first
wish
to
see
mademoiselle
de
chaverny
asked
the
regent
yes
monseigneur
but
first
i
must
have
your
promise
to
aid
me
in
my
project
remember
monseigneur
there
is
not
an
instant
to
lose
my
companions
are
condemned
as
i
was
tell
me
at
once
before
i
see
helene
that
you
will
not
abandon
me
let
me
make
a
new
engagement
with
you
i
am
a
man
i
love
and
therefore
i
am
weak
i
shall
have
to
struggle
against
her
tears
and
against
my
own
weakness
monseigneur
i
will
only
see
helene
under
the
condition
that
you
will
enable
me
to
see
the
regent
and
if
i
refuse
that
condition
then
monseigneur
i
will
not
see
helene
i
am
dead
to
her
it
is
useless
to
renew
hope
in
her
which
she
must
lose
again
it
is
enough
that
she
must
weep
for
me
once
and
you
would
still
persist
yes
but
with
less
chance
then
what
would
you
do
wait
for
the
regent
wherever
he
goes
and
strike
him
whenever
i
can
find
him
think
once
more
said
the
duke
by
the
honor
of
my
name
replied
gaston
i
once
more
implore
your
aid
or
i
declare
that
i
will
find
means
to
dispense
with
it
well
monsieur
go
and
see
helene
and
you
shall
have
my
answer
on
your
return
where
in
that
room
and
the
answer
shall
be
according
to
my
desire
yes
gaston
went
into
helene
room
she
was
kneeling
before
a
crucifix
praying
that
her
lover
might
be
restored
to
her
at
the
noise
which
gaston
made
in
opening
the
door
she
turned
round
believing
that
god
had
worked
a
miracle
and
uttering
a
cry
she
held
out
her
arms
toward
the
chevalier
but
without
the
strength
to
raise
herself
oh
mon
dieu
is
it
himself
is
it
his
shade
it
is
myself
helene
said
the
young
man
darting
toward
her
and
grasping
her
hands
but
how
a
prisoner
this
morning
free
this
evening
i
escaped
helene
and
then
you
thought
of
me
you
ran
to
me
you
would
not
fly
without
me
oh
i
recognize
my
gaston
there
well
i
am
ready
take
me
where
you
will
i
am
yours
i
am
helene
said
gaston
you
are
not
the
bride
of
an
ordinary
man
if
i
had
been
only
like
all
other
men
you
would
not
have
loved
me
oh
no
well
helene
to
superior
souls
superior
duties
are
allotted
and
consequently
greater
trials
before
i
can
be
yours
i
have
to
accomplish
the
mission
on
which
i
came
to
paris
we
have
both
a
fatal
destiny
to
fulfill
our
life
or
death
hangs
on
a
single
event
which
must
be
accomplished
what
do
you
mean
cried
the
young
girl
listen
helene
replied
gaston
if
in
four
hours
that
is
to
say
by
daybreak
you
have
no
news
of
me
do
not
expect
me
believe
that
all
that
has
passed
between
us
is
but
a
dream
and
if
you
can
obtain
permission
to
do
so
come
again
and
see
me
in
the
bastille
helene
trembled
gaston
took
her
back
to
her
where
she
knelt
then
kissing
her
on
the
forehead
as
a
brother
might
have
done
pray
on
helene
said
he
for
in
praying
for
me
you
pray
also
for
bretagne
and
for
france
then
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
alas
alas
murmured
helene
save
my
god
and
what
care
i
for
the
rest
of
the
world
gaston
was
met
by
a
servant
who
gave
him
a
note
telling
him
the
duke
was
gone
the
note
was
as
follows
there
is
a
bal
masque
at
monceaux
the
regent
will
be
there
he
generally
retires
toward
one
in
the
morning
into
a
favorite
conservatory
which
is
situated
at
the
end
of
the
gilded
gallery
no
one
enters
there
ordinarily
but
himself
because
this
habit
of
his
is
known
and
respected
the
regent
will
be
dressed
in
a
black
velvet
domino
on
the
left
arm
of
which
is
embroidered
a
golden
bee
he
hides
this
sign
in
a
fold
when
he
wishes
to
remain
incognito
the
card
i
inclose
is
an
ambassador
ticket
with
this
you
will
be
admitted
not
only
to
the
ball
but
to
this
conservatory
where
you
will
appear
to
seek
a
private
interview
use
it
for
your
encounter
with
the
regent
my
carriage
is
below
in
which
you
will
find
my
own
domino
the
coachman
is
at
your
orders
on
reading
this
note
which
as
it
were
brought
him
face
to
face
with
the
man
he
meant
to
assassinate
a
cold
perspiration
passed
over
gaston
forehead
and
he
was
obliged
for
a
moment
to
lean
against
a
chair
for
support
but
suddenly
as
if
taking
a
violent
resolution
he
darted
down
the
staircase
jumped
into
the
carriage
and
cried
to
monceaux
scarcely
had
he
quitted
the
room
when
a
secret
door
in
the
woodwork
opened
and
the
duke
entered
he
went
to
helene
door
who
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
at
seeing
him
well
said
the
regent
sadly
are
you
content
helene
oh
it
is
you
monseigneur
you
see
my
child
that
my
predictions
are
fulfilled
believe
me
when
i
say
ah
monseigneur
are
you
then
an
angel
come
down
to
earth
to
stand
to
me
in
the
place
of
the
father
whom
i
have
lost
alas
said
the
regent
smiling
i
am
not
an
angel
my
dear
helene
but
such
as
i
am
i
will
indeed
be
to
you
a
father
and
a
tender
one
saying
this
the
regent
took
helene
hand
and
was
about
to
kiss
it
respectfully
but
she
raised
her
head
and
presented
her
forehead
to
him
i
see
that
you
love
him
truly
said
he
monseigneur
i
bless
you
may
your
blessing
bring
me
happiness
said
the
regent
then
going
down
to
his
carriage
to
the
palais
royal
said
he
but
remember
you
have
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
drive
to
monceaux
the
horses
flew
along
the
road
as
the
carriage
entered
under
the
peristyle
a
courier
on
horseback
was
setting
out
dubois
having
seen
him
start
closed
the
window
and
went
back
to
his
apartments
chapter
xxxiii
monceaux
meanwhile
gaston
went
toward
monceaux
he
had
found
the
duke
domino
and
mask
in
the
carriage
the
mask
was
of
black
velvet
the
domino
of
violet
satin
he
put
them
both
on
and
suddenly
remembered
that
he
was
without
arms
he
thought
however
he
should
easily
procure
some
weapon
at
monceaux
as
he
approached
he
found
it
was
not
a
weapon
that
he
needed
but
courage
there
passed
in
his
mind
a
terrible
contest
pride
and
humanity
struggled
against
each
other
and
from
time
to
time
he
represented
to
himself
his
friends
in
prison
condemned
to
a
cruel
and
infamous
death
as
the
carriage
entered
the
courtyard
of
monceaux
he
murmured
already
however
the
carriage
stopped
the
door
was
opened
he
must
alight
the
prince
private
carriage
and
coachman
had
been
recognized
and
all
the
servants
overwhelmed
him
with
attentions
gaston
did
not
remark
it
a
kind
of
mist
passed
before
his
eyes
he
presented
his
card
it
was
the
custom
then
for
both
men
and
women
to
be
masked
but
it
was
more
frequently
the
women
than
the
men
who
went
to
these
reunions
unmasked
at
this
period
women
spoke
not
only
freely
but
well
and
the
mask
hid
neither
folly
nor
inferiority
of
rank
for
the
women
of
that
day
were
all
witty
and
if
they
were
handsome
they
were
soon
titled
witness
the
duchesse
de
chateauroux
and
the
comtesse
dubarry
gaston
knew
no
one
but
he
felt
instinctively
that
he
was
among
the
most
select
society
of
the
day
among
the
men
were
novilles
brancas
broglie
simon
and
biron
the
women
might
be
more
mixed
but
certainly
not
less
spirituelles
nor
less
elegant
no
one
knew
how
to
organize
a
fete
like
the
regent
the
luxury
of
good
taste
the
profusion
of
flowers
the
lights
the
princes
and
ambassadors
the
charming
and
beautiful
women
who
surrounded
him
all
had
their
effect
on
gaston
who
now
recognized
in
the
regent
not
only
a
king
but
a
king
at
once
powerful
gay
amiable
beloved
and
above
all
popular
and
national
gaston
heart
beat
when
seeking
among
these
heads
the
one
for
which
his
blows
were
destined
he
saw
a
black
domino
without
the
mask
which
hid
his
face
and
concealed
from
all
eyes
its
changing
expression
he
would
not
have
taken
four
steps
through
the
rooms
without
some
one
pointing
him
out
as
an
assassin
gaston
could
not
conceal
from
himself
that
there
was
something
cowardly
in
coming
to
a
prince
his
host
to
change
those
brilliant
lights
into
funeral
torches
to
stain
those
dazzling
tapestries
with
blood
to
arouse
the
cry
of
terror
amid
the
joyous
tumult
of
a
fete
and
at
this
thought
his
courage
failed
him
and
he
stepped
toward
the
door
i
will
kill
him
outside
said
he
but
not
here
then
he
remembered
the
duke
directions
his
card
would
open
to
him
the
isolated
conservatory
and
he
murmured
he
foresaw
that
i
should
be
a
coward
he
approached
a
sort
of
gallery
containing
buffets
where
the
guests
came
for
refreshment
he
went
also
not
that
he
was
hungry
or
thirsty
but
because
he
was
unarmed
he
chose
a
long
sharp
and
pointed
knife
and
put
it
under
his
domino
where
he
was
sure
no
one
could
see
it
the
likeness
to
ravaillac
will
be
complete
said
he
at
this
moment
as
gaston
turned
he
heard
a
voice
say
you
hesitate
gaston
opened
his
domino
and
showed
the
duke
the
knife
which
it
concealed
i
see
the
knife
glisten
but
i
also
see
the
hand
tremble
yes
monseigneur
it
is
true
said
gaston
i
hesitated
i
trembled
i
felt
inclined
to
fly
but
thank
god
you
are
here
and
your
ferocious
courage
said
the
duke
in
a
mocking
voice
it
is
not
that
i
have
lost
it
what
has
become
of
it
then
monseigneur
i
am
under
his
roof
yes
but
in
the
conservatory
you
are
not
could
you
not
show
him
to
me
first
that
i
might
accustom
myself
to
his
presence
that
i
may
be
inspired
by
the
hatred
i
bear
him
for
i
do
not
know
how
to
find
him
in
this
crowd
just
now
he
was
near
you
gaston
shuddered
near
me
said
he
as
near
as
i
am
replied
the
duke
gravely
i
will
go
to
the
conservatory
monseigneur
go
then
yet
a
moment
monseigneur
that
i
may
recover
myself
very
well
you
know
the
conservatory
is
beyond
that
gallery
stay
the
doors
are
closed
did
you
not
say
that
with
this
card
the
servants
would
open
them
to
me
yes
but
it
would
be
better
to
open
them
yourself
a
servant
might
wait
for
your
exit
if
you
are
thus
agitated
before
you
strike
the
blow
what
will
it
be
afterward
then
the
regent
probably
will
not
fall
without
defending
himself
without
a
cry
they
will
all
run
to
him
you
will
be
arrested
and
adieu
your
hope
of
the
future
think
of
helene
who
waits
for
you
it
is
impossible
to
describe
what
was
passing
in
gaston
heart
during
this
speech
the
duke
however
watched
its
effect
upon
his
countenance
well
said
gaston
what
shall
i
do
advise
me
when
you
are
at
the
door
of
the
conservatory
the
one
which
opens
on
to
the
gallery
turning
to
the
left
do
you
know
yes
under
the
lock
you
will
find
a
carved
button
push
it
and
the
door
will
open
unless
it
be
fastened
within
but
the
regent
who
has
no
suspicion
will
not
take
this
precaution
i
have
been
there
twenty
times
for
a
private
audience
if
he
be
not
there
wait
for
him
you
will
know
him
if
there
by
the
black
domino
and
the
golden
bee
yes
yes
i
know
said
gaston
not
knowing
however
what
he
said
i
do
not
reckon
much
on
you
this
evening
replied
the
duke
ah
monseigneur
the
moment
approaches
which
will
change
my
past
life
into
a
doubtful
future
perhaps
of
shame
at
least
of
remorse
remorse
replied
the
duke
when
we
perform
an
action
which
we
believe
to
be
just
and
commanded
by
conscience
we
do
not
feel
remorse
do
you
doubt
the
sanctity
of
your
cause
no
monseigneur
but
it
is
easy
for
you
to
speak
thus
you
have
the
idea
i
the
execution
you
are
the
head
but
i
am
the
arm
believe
me
monseigneur
continued
he
in
a
hollow
voice
and
choking
with
emotion
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
kill
a
man
who
is
before
you
defenseless
smiling
on
his
murderer
i
thought
myself
courageous
and
strong
but
it
must
be
thus
with
every
conspirator
who
undertakes
what
i
have
done
in
a
moment
of
excitement
of
pride
of
enthusiasm
or
of
hatred
we
take
a
fatal
vow
then
there
is
a
vast
extent
of
time
between
us
and
our
victim
but
the
oath
taken
the
fever
is
calmed
the
enthusiasm
cools
the
hatred
diminishes
every
day
brings
us
nearer
the
end
to
which
we
are
tending
and
then
we
shudder
when
we
feel
what
a
crime
we
have
undertaken
and
yet
inexorable
time
flows
on
and
at
every
hour
which
strikes
we
see
our
victim
take
another
step
until
at
length
the
interval
between
us
disappears
and
we
stand
face
to
face
believe
me
monseigneur
the
bravest
tremble
for
murder
is
always
murder
then
we
see
that
we
are
not
the
ministers
of
our
consciences
but
the
slaves
of
our
oaths
we
set
out
with
head
erect
saying
am
the
chosen
one
we
arrive
with
head
bowed
down
saying
am
accursed
there
is
yet
time
monsieur
no
no
you
well
know
monseigneur
that
fate
urges
me
onward
i
shall
accomplish
my
task
terrible
though
it
be
my
heart
will
shudder
but
my
hand
will
still
be
firm
yes
i
tell
you
were
it
not
for
my
friends
whose
lives
hang
on
the
blow
i
am
about
to
strike
were
there
no
helene
whom
i
should
cover
with
mourning
if
not
with
blood
oh
i
would
prefer
the
scaffold
even
the
scaffold
with
all
its
shame
for
that
does
not
punish
it
absolves
come
said
the
duke
i
see
that
though
you
tremble
you
will
act
do
not
doubt
it
monseigneur
pray
for
me
for
in
half
an
hour
all
will
be
over
the
duke
gave
an
involuntary
start
however
approving
determination
he
once
more
mixed
with
the
crowd
gaston
found
an
open
window
with
a
balcony
he
stepped
out
for
a
moment
to
cool
the
fever
in
his
veins
but
it
was
in
vain
the
flame
which
consumed
him
was
not
to
be
extinguished
thus
he
heard
one
strike
now
he
murmured
the
time
is
come
and
i
can
not
draw
back
my
god
to
thee
i
recommend
my
soul
helene
adieu
then
slowly
but
firmly
he
went
to
the
door
and
pressing
the
button
it
opened
noiselessly
before
him
a
mist
came
before
his
eyes
he
seemed
in
a
new
world
the
music
sounded
like
a
distant
and
charming
melody
around
him
breathed
the
sweetly
perfumed
flowers
and
alabaster
lamps
half
hidden
in
luxuriant
foliage
shed
a
delicious
twilight
over
the
scene
while
through
the
interlacing
leaves
of
tropical
plants
could
just
be
seen
the
leafless
gloomy
trees
beyond
and
the
snow
covering
the
earth
as
with
a
winding
sheet
even
the
temperature
was
changed
and
a
sudden
shiver
passed
through
his
veins
the
contrast
of
all
this
verdure
these
magnificent
and
blossoming
orange
trees
these
magnolias
splendid
with
the
waxy
blooms
with
the
gilded
salons
he
had
left
bewildered
him
it
seemed
difficult
to
connect
the
thought
of
murder
with
this
and
enchanted
scene
the
soft
gravel
yielded
to
his
tread
and
plashing
fountains
murmured
forth
a
plaintive
and
monotonous
harmony
gaston
was
almost
afraid
to
look
for
a
human
form
at
length
he
glanced
round
nothing
he
went
on
at
length
beneath
a
palm
surrounded
by
blooming
rhododendrons
he
saw
the
black
phantom
seated
on
a
bank
of
moss
his
back
turned
toward
the
side
from
whence
he
was
approaching
the
blood
rushed
to
gaston
cheeks
his
hand
trembled
and
he
vainly
sought
for
some
support
the
domino
did
not
move
gaston
involuntarily
drew
back
all
at
once
he
forced
his
rebellious
limbs
to
move
on
and
his
trembling
fingers
to
grasp
the
knife
they
had
almost
abandoned
and
he
stepped
toward
the
regent
stifling
a
sob
which
was
about
to
escape
him
at
this
moment
the
figure
moved
and
gaston
saw
the
golden
bee
which
seemed
like
a
burning
gem
before
his
eyes
the
domino
turned
toward
gaston
and
as
he
did
so
the
young
man
arm
grew
rigid
the
foam
rose
to
his
lips
his
teeth
chattered
for
a
vague
suspicion
entered
his
breast
suddenly
he
uttered
a
piercing
cry
the
domino
had
risen
and
was
unmasked
his
face
was
that
of
the
duc
gaston
thunderstruck
remained
livid
and
mute
the
regent
and
the
duke
were
one
and
the
same
the
regent
retained
his
calm
majestic
attitude
looked
at
the
hand
which
held
the
knife
and
the
knife
fell
then
looking
at
his
intended
murderer
with
a
smile
at
once
sweet
and
sad
gaston
fell
down
before
him
like
a
tree
cut
by
the
ax
not
a
word
had
been
spoken
nothing
was
heard
but
gaston
broken
sobs
and
the
water
of
the
fountains
plashing
monotonously
as
it
fell
chapter
xxxiv
the
pardon
rise
monsieur
said
the
regent
no
monseigneur
cried
gaston
bowing
his
forehead
to
the
ground
oh
no
it
is
at
your
feet
that
i
should
die
die
gaston
you
see
that
you
are
pardoned
oh
monseigneur
punish
me
in
heaven
name
for
you
must
indeed
despise
me
if
you
pardon
me
but
have
you
not
guessed
asked
the
regent
what
the
reason
why
i
pardon
you
gaston
cast
a
retrospective
glance
upon
the
past
his
sad
and
solitary
youth
his
brother
despairing
death
his
love
for
helene
those
days
that
seemed
so
long
away
from
her
those
nights
that
passed
so
quickly
beneath
the
convent
window
his
journey
to
paris
the
duke
kindness
to
the
young
girl
and
last
this
unexpected
clemency
but
in
all
this
he
beheld
nothing
he
divined
nothing
thank
helene
said
the
duke
who
saw
that
gaston
vainly
sought
the
cause
of
what
had
happened
thank
helene
for
it
is
she
who
saves
your
life
helene
monseigneur
i
can
not
punish
my
daughter
affianced
husband
helene
your
daughter
oh
monseigneur
and
i
would
have
killed
you
yes
remember
what
you
said
just
now
we
set
out
the
chosen
one
we
return
the
murderer
and
sometimes
you
see
more
than
a
murderer
a
parricide
for
i
am
almost
your
father
said
the
duke
holding
out
his
hand
to
gaston
monseigneur
have
mercy
on
me
you
have
a
noble
heart
gaston
and
you
monseigneur
are
a
noble
prince
henceforth
i
am
yours
body
and
soul
every
drop
of
my
blood
for
one
tear
of
helene
for
one
wish
of
your
highness
thanks
gaston
said
the
duke
smiling
i
will
repay
your
devotion
by
your
happiness
i
happy
through
your
highness
ah
monseigneur
god
revenges
himself
in
permitting
you
to
return
me
so
much
good
for
the
evil
i
intended
you
the
regent
smiled
at
this
effusion
of
simple
joy
when
the
door
opened
and
gave
entrance
to
a
green
domino
captain
la
jonquiere
cried
gaston
dubois
murmured
the
duke
frowning
monseigneur
said
gaston
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
pale
with
affright
monseigneur
i
am
lost
it
is
no
longer
i
who
must
be
saved
i
forgot
my
honor
i
forgot
my
friends
your
friends
monsieur
said
the
duke
coldly
i
thought
you
no
longer
made
common
cause
with
such
men
monseigneur
you
said
i
had
a
noble
heart
believe
me
when
i
say
that
pontcalec
montlouis
du
couëdic
and
talhouet
have
hearts
as
noble
as
my
own
noble
repeated
the
duke
contemptuously
yes
monseigneur
i
repeat
what
i
said
and
do
you
know
what
they
would
have
done
my
poor
child
you
who
were
their
blind
tool
the
arm
that
they
placed
at
the
end
of
their
thoughts
these
noble
hearts
would
have
delivered
their
country
to
the
stranger
they
would
have
erased
the
name
of
france
from
the
list
of
sovereign
nations
nobles
they
were
bound
to
set
an
example
of
courage
and
loyalty
they
have
given
that
of
perfidy
and
cowardice
well
you
do
not
reply
you
lower
your
eyes
if
it
be
your
poniard
you
seek
it
is
at
your
feet
take
it
up
there
is
yet
time
monsieur
said
gaston
clasping
his
hands
i
renounce
my
ideas
of
assassination
i
detest
them
and
i
ask
your
pardon
for
having
entertained
them
but
if
you
will
not
save
my
friends
i
beg
of
you
at
least
to
let
me
perish
with
them
if
i
live
when
they
die
my
honor
dies
with
them
think
of
it
monseigneur
the
honor
of
the
name
your
daughter
is
to
bear
the
regent
bent
his
head
as
he
replied
it
is
impossible
monsieur
they
have
betrayed
france
and
they
must
die
then
i
die
with
them
said
gaston
for
i
also
have
betrayed
france
and
moreover
would
have
murdered
your
highness
the
regent
looked
at
dubois
the
glance
they
exchanged
did
not
escape
gaston
he
understood
that
he
had
dealt
with
a
false
la
jonquiere
as
well
as
a
false
duc
no
said
dubois
addressing
gaston
you
shall
not
die
for
that
monsieur
but
you
must
understand
that
there
are
crimes
which
the
regent
has
neither
the
power
nor
the
right
to
pardon
but
he
pardoned
me
exclaimed
you
are
helene
husband
said
the
duke
you
mistake
monseigneur
i
am
not
and
i
shall
never
be
and
as
such
a
sacrifice
involves
the
death
of
him
who
makes
it
i
shall
die
monseigneur
bah
said
dubois
no
one
dies
of
love
nowadays
it
was
very
well
in
the
time
of
and
mademoiselle
de
scuderi
perhaps
you
are
right
monsieur
but
in
all
times
men
die
by
the
dagger
and
gaston
stopped
and
picked
up
the
knife
with
an
expression
which
was
not
to
be
mistaken
dubois
did
not
move
the
regent
made
a
step
throw
down
that
weapon
monsieur
said
he
with
hauteur
gaston
placed
the
point
against
his
breast
throw
it
down
i
say
repeated
the
regent
the
life
of
my
friends
monseigneur
said
gaston
the
regent
turned
again
to
dubois
who
smiled
a
sardonic
smile
is
well
said
the
regent
they
shall
live
ah
monsieur
said
gaston
seizing
the
duke
hand
and
trying
to
raise
it
to
his
lips
you
are
the
image
of
god
on
earth
monseigneur
you
commit
an
irreparable
fault
said
dubois
what
cried
gaston
astonished
you
are
then
the
abbe
dubois
at
your
service
said
the
false
la
jonquiere
bowing
oh
monseigneur
listen
only
to
your
own
heart
i
implore
monseigneur
sign
nothing
said
dubois
sign
monseigneur
sign
repeated
gaston
you
promised
they
should
live
and
i
know
your
promise
is
sacred
dubois
i
shall
sign
said
the
duke
has
your
highness
decided
i
have
given
my
word
very
well
as
you
please
at
once
monseigneur
at
once
i
know
not
why
but
i
am
alarmed
in
spite
of
myself
monseigneur
their
pardon
i
implore
you
eh
monsieur
said
dubois
since
his
highness
has
promised
what
signify
five
minutes
more
or
less
the
regent
looked
uneasily
at
dubois
yes
you
are
right
said
he
this
very
moment
your
portfolio
abbe
and
quick
the
young
man
is
impatient
dubois
bowed
assent
called
a
servant
got
his
portfolio
and
presented
to
the
regent
a
sheet
of
paper
who
wrote
an
order
on
it
and
signed
it
now
a
courier
oh
no
monseigneur
it
is
useless
why
so
a
courier
would
never
go
quickly
enough
i
will
go
myself
if
your
highness
will
permit
me
every
moment
i
gain
will
save
those
unhappy
men
an
age
of
torture
dubois
frowned
yes
yes
you
are
right
said
the
regent
go
yourself
and
he
added
in
a
low
voice
and
do
not
let
the
order
leave
your
hands
but
monseigneur
said
dubois
you
are
more
impatient
than
the
young
man
himself
you
forget
that
if
he
goes
thus
there
is
some
one
in
paris
who
will
think
he
is
dead
these
words
struck
gaston
and
recalled
to
him
helene
whom
he
had
left
expecting
him
from
one
moment
to
another
in
the
fear
of
some
great
event
and
who
would
never
forgive
him
should
he
leave
paris
without
seeing
her
in
an
instant
his
resolution
was
taken
he
kissed
the
hand
took
the
order
and
was
going
when
the
regent
said
not
a
word
to
helene
of
what
i
told
you
the
only
recompense
i
ask
of
you
is
to
leave
me
the
pleasure
of
telling
her
she
is
my
child
your
highness
shall
be
obeyed
said
gaston
moved
to
tears
and
again
bowing
he
hastily
went
out
this
way
said
dubois
really
you
look
as
if
you
had
assassinated
some
one
and
you
will
be
arrested
cross
this
grove
at
the
end
is
a
path
which
will
lead
you
to
the
street
oh
thank
you
you
understand
that
delay
might
be
fatal
that
is
why
added
he
to
himself
i
have
shown
you
the
longest
way
go
when
gaston
had
disappeared
dubois
returned
to
the
regent
what
is
the
matter
monseigneur
asked
he
you
seem
uneasy
i
am
and
why
you
made
no
resistance
to
my
performing
a
good
action
this
frightened
me
dubois
smiled
dubois
said
the
duke
you
are
plotting
something
no
monseigneur
it
is
all
arranged
what
have
you
done
monseigneur
i
know
you
well
i
knew
what
would
happen
that
you
would
never
be
satisfied
till
you
had
signed
the
pardon
of
all
these
fellows
go
on
well
i
also
have
sent
a
courier
you
yes
i
have
i
not
the
right
to
send
couriers
yes
but
in
heaven
name
tell
me
what
order
your
courier
carried
an
order
for
their
execution
and
he
is
gone
dubois
took
out
his
watch
two
hours
ago
said
he
wretch
ah
monseigneur
always
big
words
every
man
to
his
trade
save
de
chanlay
if
you
like
he
is
your
as
for
me
i
save
you
yes
but
i
know
de
chanlay
he
will
arrive
before
the
courier
no
monseigneur
two
hours
are
nothing
to
a
man
like
him
he
will
soon
have
made
them
up
were
my
courier
only
two
hours
in
advance
said
dubois
de
chanlay
might
overtake
him
but
he
will
be
three
how
so
because
the
worthy
young
man
is
in
love
and
if
i
reckon
an
hour
for
taking
leave
of
your
daughter
i
am
sure
it
is
not
too
much
serpent
i
understand
the
meaning
of
what
you
said
just
now
he
was
in
an
excess
of
enthusiasm
he
might
have
forgotten
his
love
you
know
my
principle
monseigneur
distrust
first
impulses
they
are
always
good
it
is
an
infamous
principle
monseigneur
either
one
is
a
diplomatist
or
one
is
not
well
said
the
regent
stepping
toward
the
door
i
shall
go
and
warn
him
monseigneur
said
dubois
stopping
the
duke
with
an
accent
of
extreme
resolution
and
taking
a
paper
out
of
his
portfolio
already
prepared
if
you
do
so
have
the
kindness
in
that
case
to
accept
my
resignation
at
once
joke
if
you
will
but
as
horace
said
modus
in
rebus
he
was
a
great
as
well
as
a
courteous
man
come
come
monseigneur
a
truce
to
politics
for
this
evening
go
back

all

four
of
her
worst
enemies

greatly
prefer

assure
you
and
with
these
words
they
returned
to
the
ballroom
dubois
joyous
and
triumphant
the
duke
sad
and
thoughtful
but
convinced
that
his
minister
was
right
chapter
xxxv
the
last
interview
gaston
left
the
conservatory
his
heart
bounding
with
joy
the
enormous
weight
which
had
oppressed
him
since
the
commencement
of
the
conspiracy
and
which
helene
love
had
scarcely
been
able
to
alleviate
now
seemed
to
disappear
as
at
the
touch
of
an
angel
to
dreams
of
vengeance
dreams
both
terrible
and
bloody
succeeded
visions
of
love
and
glory
helene
was
not
only
a
charming
and
a
loving
woman
she
was
also
a
princess
of
the
blood
royal
one
of
those
divinities
whose
tenderness
men
would
purchase
with
their
hearts
blood
if
they
did
not
being
after
all
weak
as
mortals
give
this
inestimable
tenderness
away
and
gaston
felt
revive
within
his
breast
the
slumbering
instinct
of
ambition
what
a
brilliant
fortune
was
his
one
to
be
envied
by
such
men
as
richelieu
and
lauzun
no
louis
imposing
as
on
lauzun
exile
or
the
abandonment
of
his
mistress
no
irritated
father
combating
the
pretensions
of
a
simple
gentleman
but
on
the
contrary
a
powerful
friend
greedy
of
love
longing
to
prove
his
affection
for
his
pure
and
noble
daughter
a
holy
emulation
between
the
daughter
and
the
to
make
themselves
more
worthy
of
so
just
a
prince
so
mild
a
conqueror
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
gaston
had
gained
the
rue
du
bac
the
door
opened
before
him
a
cry
was
heard
helene
at
the
window
watching
for
his
return

recognized
the
carriage
and
ran
joyously
to
meet
him
saved
cried
gaston

promised

you
gaston
helene
i
beg
of

i
must
be
at
nantes
in
twenty
hours
i
will
follow

fatigue
then
because

protector
to
whom
you
owe
respect
and
obedience
the
duke

has
done
for
me
for
us

us
leave
a
letter
for
him
and
he

forgive
us

no
helene
while

saving
angel

preparations

in
a
voice
of
distress
oh

i
can
not
leave
you
so
oh
no
be
joyous
helene
smile
on
me
say
to
me
in
giving
me
your
hand
that
hand
so
pure
and
faithful
gaston
go
for
it
is
your
duty
yes
my
friend
said
helene
perhaps
i
ought
to
speak
thus
but
i
have
not
the
strength
oh
gaston
forgive
me
oh
helene
when
i
am
so
joyful
gaston
it
is
beyond
my
power
remember
that
you
take
with
you
the
half
of
my
life
gaston
heard
the
clock
strike
three
and
started
adieu
helene
said
he
adieu
murmured
she
once
more
he
pressed
her
hand
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
then
dashed
down
the
staircase
toward
the
door
but
he
heard
helene
sobs
rapidly
he
remounted
the
staircase
and
ran
to
her
she
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
room
he
had
just
left
gaston
clasped
her
in
his
arms
and
she
hung
weeping
upon
his
neck
oh
mon
dieu
cried
she
you
leave
me
again
gaston
listen
to
what
i
say
we
shall
never
meet
more
my
poor
helene
cried
the
young
man
you
are
mad
despair
has
made
me
so
and
her
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
all
at
once
she
seemed
to
make
a
violent
effort
and
pressing
her
lips
on
those
of
her
lover
she
clasped
him
tightly
to
her
breast
then
quickly
repulsing
him
now
go
gaston
said
she
now
i
can
die
gaston
replied
by
passionate
caresses
the
clock
struck
the
half
hour
another
half
hour
to
make
up
adieu
adieu
gaston
you
are
right
you
should
already
be
away
adieu
for
a
time
adieu
gaston
and
helene
returned
to
the
pavilion
gaston
procured
a
horse
saddled
mounted
and
left
paris
by
the
same
gate
by
which
he
had
entered
some
days
previously
chapter
xxxvi
nantes
the
commission
named
by
dubois
was
to
be
permanent
invested
with
unlimited
powers
which
in
certain
cases
means
that
the
decision
is
settled
beforehand
they
besieged
the
earth
supported
by
strong
detachments
of
troops
since
the
arrest
of
the
four
gentlemen
nantes
terrified
at
first
had
risen
in
their
favor
the
whole
of
bretagne
awaited
a
revolt
but
in
the
meanwhile
was
quiet
however
the
trial
was
approaching
on
the
eve
of
the
public
audience
pontcalec
held
a
serious
conversation
with
his
friends
let
us
consider
said
he
whether
in
word
or
deed
we
have
committed
any
imprudence
no
said
the
other
three
has
any
one
of
you
imparted
our
projects
to
his
wife
his
brother
a
friend
have
you
montlouis
no
on
my
honor
you
talhouet
no
you
couëdic
no
then
they
have
neither
proof
nor
accusation
against
us
no
one
has
surprised
us
no
one
wishes
us
harm
but
said
montlouis
meanwhile
we
shall
be
tried
on
what
grounds
oh
secret
information
said
talhouet
smiling
very
secret
said
du
couëdic
since
they
do
not
breathe
a
word
ah
one
fine
night
they
will
force
us
to
escape
that
they
may
not
be
obliged
to
liberate
us
some
fine
day
i
do
not
believe
it
said
montlouis
who
had
always
been
the
most
desponding
perhaps
because
he
had
the
most
at
stake
having
a
young
wife
and
two
children
who
adored
him
i
do
not
believe
it
i
have
seen
dubois
in
england
i
have
talked
with
him
his
face
is
like
a
ferret
licking
his
lips
when
thirsty
dubois
is
thirsty
and
we
are
taken
dubois
thirst
will
be
slaked
by
our
blood
but
said
du
couëdic
there
is
the
parliament
of
bretagne
yes
to
look
on
while
we
lose
our
heads
there
was
only
one
of
the
four
who
smiled
that
was
pontcalec
my
friends
said
he
take
courage
if
dubois
be
thirsty
so
much
the
worse
for
dubois
he
will
go
mad
that
is
all
but
this
time
i
answer
for
it
he
shall
not
taste
our
blood
and
indeed
from
the
beginning
the
task
of
the
commission
seemed
difficult
no
confessions
no
proofs
no
witnesses
bretagne
laughed
in
the
commissioners
faces
and
when
she
did
not
laugh
she
threatened
the
president
dispatched
a
courier
to
paris
to
explain
the
state
of
things
and
get
further
instructions
judge
by
their
projects
said
dubois
they
may
have
done
little
because
they
were
prevented
but
they
intended
much
and
the
intention
in
matters
of
rebellion
is
equivalent
to
the
act
armed
with
this
terrible
weapon
the
commission
soon
overthrew
the
hopes
of
the
province
there
was
a
terrible
audience
in
which
the
accused
commenced
with
raillery
and
ended
with
accusation
on
the
prison
pontcalec
congratulated
them
on
the
truths
they
had
told
the
judge
nevertheless
said
montlouis
it
is
a
bad
affair
bretagne
does
not
revolt
she
waits
our
condemnation
said
talhouet
then
she
will
revolt
somewhat
late
said
montlouis
but
our
condemnation
may
not
take
place
said
pontcalec
say
frankly
we
are
guilty
but
without
proofs
who
will
dare
to
sentence
us
the
commission
no
not
the
commission
but
dubois
i
have
a
great
mind
to
do
one
thing
said
du
couëdic
what
at
the
first
audience
to
cry
to
the
rescue
each
time
we
have
seen
faces
of
friends
we
should
be
delivered
or
killed
but
at
least
it
would
be
decided
i
should
prefer
death
to
this
suspense
but
why
run
the
risk
of
being
wounded
by
some
satellite
of
justice
because
such
a
wound
might
be
healed
not
so
the
wound
the
executioner
would
make
oh
said
pontcalec
you
will
have
no
more
to
do
with
the
executioner
than
i
shall
always
the
prediction
said
montlouis
you
know
that
i
have
no
faith
in
it
you
are
wrong
this
is
sure
my
friends
said
pontcalec
we
shall
be
exiled
we
shall
be
forced
to
embark
and
i
shall
be
lost
on
the
way
this
is
my
fate
but
yours
may
be
different
ask
to
go
by
a
different
vessel
from
me
or
there
is
another
chance
i
may
fall
from
the
deck
or
slip
on
the
steps
at
least
i
shall
die
by
the
water
you
know
that
is
certain
i
might
be
condemned
to
death
taken
to
the
very
scaffold
but
if
the
scaffold
were
on
dry
ground
i
should
be
as
easy
as
i
am
now
his
tone
of
confidence
gave
them
courage
they
even
laughed
at
the
rapidity
with
which
the
deliberations
were
carried
on
they
did
not
know
that
dubois
sent
courier
after
courier
from
paris
to
hasten
them
at
length
the
commission
declared
themselves
sufficiently
enlightened
and
retired
to
deliberate
in
secret
session
never
was
there
a
more
stormy
discussion
history
has
penetrated
the
secrets
of
these
deliberations
in
which
some
of
the
least
bold
or
least
ambitious
counselors
revolted
against
the
idea
of
condemning
these
gentlemen
on
presumptions
which
were
supported
solely
by
the
intelligence
transmitted
to
them
by
dubois
but
the
majority
were
devoted
to
dubois
and
the
committee
came
to
abuse
and
quarrels
and
almost
to
blows
at
the
end
of
a
sitting
of
eleven
hours
duration
the
majority
declared
their
decision
the
commissioners
associated
sixteen
others
of
the
contumacious
gentlemen
with
the
four
chiefs
and
declared
that
the
accused
found
guilty
of
criminal
projects
of
treason
and
of
felonious
intentions
should
be
beheaded
those
present
in
person
those
absent
in
effigy
that
the
walls
and
fortifications
of
their
castles
should
be
demolished
their
patents
of
nobility
annuled
and
their
forests
cut
down
to
the
height
of
nine
feet
an
hour
after
the
delivery
of
this
sentence
an
order
was
given
to
the
usher
to
announce
it
to
the
prisoners
the
sentence
had
been
given
after
the
stormy
sitting
of
which
we
have
spoken
and
in
which
the
accused
had
experienced
such
lively
marks
of
sympathy
from
the
public
and
so
having
beaten
the
judges
on
all
the
counts
of
the
indictment
never
had
they
been
so
full
of
hope
they
were
seated
at
supper
in
their
common
room
calling
to
mind
all
the
details
of
the
sitting
when
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
in
the
shade
appeared
the
pale
and
stern
form
of
the
usher
the
solemn
apparition
changed
on
the
instant
into
anxious
palpitations
their
pleasant
conversation
the
usher
advanced
slowly
while
the
jailer
remained
at
the
door
and
the
barrels
of
muskets
were
seen
shining
in
the
gloom
of
the
corridor
what
is
your
will
sir
asked
pontcalec
and
what
signifies
this
deadly
paraphernalia
gentlemen
said
the
usher
i
bear
the
sentence
of
the
tribunal
on
your
knees
and
listen
how
said
montlouis
it
is
only
sentences
of
death
that
must
be
heard
kneeling
on
your
knees
gentlemen
replied
the
usher
let
the
guilty
and
the
base
kneel
said
du
couëdic
we
are
gentlemen
and
innocent
we
will
hear
our
sentences
standing
as
you
will
gentlemen
but
uncover
yourselves
for
i
speak
in
the
king
name
talhouet
who
alone
had
his
hat
on
removed
it
the
four
gentlemen
stood
erect
and
leaning
on
each
other
with
pale
faces
and
a
smile
upon
their
lips
the
usher
read
the
sentence
through
uninterrupted
by
a
murmur
or
by
a
single
gesture
of
surprise
when
he
had
finished
why
was
i
told
asked
pontcalec
to
declare
the
designs
of
spain
against
france
and
that
i
should
be
liberated
spain
was
an
country
i
declared
what
i
believed
i
knew
of
her
projects
and
lo
i
am
condemned
why
is
this
is
the
commission
then
composed
of
cowards
who
spread
snares
for
the
accused
the
usher
made
no
answer
but
added
montlouis
the
regent
spared
all
paris
implicated
in
the
conspiracy
of
cellamare
not
a
drop
of
blood
was
shed
yet
those
who
wished
to
carry
off
the
regent
perhaps
to
kill
him
were
at
least
as
guilty
as
men
against
whom
no
serious
accusations
even
could
be
made
are
we
then
chosen
to
pay
for
the
indulgence
shown
to
the
capital
the
usher
made
no
reply
you
forget
one
thing
montlouis
said
du
couëdic
the
old
family
hatred
against
bretagne
and
the
regent
to
make
people
believe
that
he
belongs
to
the
family
wishes
to
prove
that
he
hates
us
it
is
not
we
personally
who
are
struck
at
it
is
a
province
which
for
three
hundred
years
has
claimed
in
vain
its
privileges
and
its
rights
and
which
they
wish
to
find
guilty
in
order
to
have
done
with
it
forever
the
usher
preserved
a
religious
silence
enough
said
talhouet
we
are
condemned
is
well
now
have
we
or
have
we
not
the
right
of
appeal
no
gentlemen
said
the
usher
then
you
can
retire
said
couëdic
the
usher
bowed
and
withdrew
followed
by
his
escort
and
the
prison
door
heavy
and
clanging
closed
once
more
upon
the
four
gentlemen
well
said
montlouis
when
they
were
again
alone
well
we
are
condemned
said
pontcalec
i
never
said
there
would
be
no
sentence
i
only
said
it
would
not
be
carried
into
execution
i
am
of
pontcalec
opinion
said
talhouet
what
they
have
done
is
but
to
terrify
the
province
and
test
its
patience
besides
said
du
couëdic
they
will
not
execute
us
without
the
regent
ratification
of
the
sentence
now
without
an
extraordinary
courier
it
will
take
two
days
to
reach
paris

his
head

pontcalec

should
have
heard
of

talhouet

montlouis
and

pontcalec

waters

montlouis

evil
omen

said
pontcalec
and
he
called
the
jailer
the
man
on
entering
found
the
four
friends
at
table
he
looked
at
them
in
astonishment
well
what
is
there
new
master
christopher
said
pontcalec
christopher
came
from
guer
and
had
a
particular
respect
for
pontcalec
whose
uncle
crysogon
had
been
his
seigneur
nothing
but
what
you
know
he
replied
then
go
and
fetch
some
wine
they
wish
to
deaden
their
feelings
said
the
jailer
to
himself
poor
gentlemen
montlouis
alone
heard
christopher
remark
and
he
smiled
sadly
an
instant
afterward
they
heard
steps
rapidly
approaching
their
room
the
door
opened
and
christopher
reappeared
without
any
bottle
in
his
hand
well
said
pontcalec
where
is
the
wine
good
news
cried
christopher
without
answering
pontcalec
inquiry
good
news
gentlemen

montlouis

the
regent
dead
and
bretagne
in
revolt
asked
du
couëdic
no
i
could
not
call
that
good
news
well
what
is
it
then
said
pontcalec
monsieur
de
chateauneuf
has
just
ordered
back
to
their
barracks
the
hundred
and
fifty
men
who
were
under
arms
in
the
which
had
terrified
everybody
ah
said
montlouis
i
begin
to
believe
it
will
not
take
place
this
evening
at
this
moment
the
clock
struck
six
well
said
pontcalec
good
news
is
no
reason
for
our
remaining
thirsty
go
and
fetch
our
wine
christopher
went
out
and
returned
in
ten
minutes
with
a
bottle
the
friends
who
were
still
at
table
filled
their
glasses
to
gaston
health
said
pontcalec
exchanging
a
meaning
glance
with
his
friends
to
whom
alone
this
toast
was
comprehensible
and
they
emptied
their
glasses
all
except
montlouis
who
stopped
as
he
was
lifting
his
to
his
lips
well
what
is
it
said
pontcalec
the
drum
said
montlouis
stretching
out
his
hand
in
the
direction
where
he
heard
the
sound
well
said
talhouet
did
you
not
hear
what
christopher
said
it
is
the
troops
returning
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
troops
going
out
that
is
not
a
retreat
but
the
générale
the
générale
said
talhouet
what
on
earth
can
that
mean
no
good
said
montlouis
shaking
his
head
christopher
said
pontcalec
turning
to
the
jailer
yes
gentlemen
i
will
find
out
what
it
is
said
he
and
be
back
in
an
instant
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
but
not
without
carefully
shutting
the
door
behind
him
the
four
friends
remained
in
anxious
silence
after
a
lapse
of
ten
minutes
the
door
opened
and
the
jailer
reappeared
pale
with
terror
a
courier
has
just
entered
the
castle
court
said
he
he
comes
from
paris
he
has
delivered
his
dispatches
and
immediately
the
guards
were
doubled
and
the
drums
beat
in
all
the
barracks
oh
oh
said
montlouis
that
concerns
us
some
one
is
ascending
the
stairs
said
the
jailer
more
pale
and
trembling
than
those
to
whom
he
spoke
in
fact
they
heard
the
butt
ends
of
the
muskets
clanging
on
the
stones
of
the
corridor
and
at
the
same
time
several
voices
were
heard
speaking
hastily
the
door
opened
and
the
usher
reappeared
gentlemen
said
he
how
long
do
you
desire
to
set
your
worldly
affairs
in
order
and
to
undergo
your
sentence
a
profound
terror
froze
even
the
hearers
i
desire
said
montlouis
time
for
the
sentence
to
reach
paris
and
return
approved
by
the
regent
i
said
talhouet
only
desire
the
time
necessary
for
the
commission
to
repent
of
its
iniquity
as
for
me
said
du
couëdic
i
wish
for
time
for
the
minister
at
paris
to
commute
the
sentence
into
eight
days
imprisonment
which
we
deserve
for
having
acted
somewhat
thoughtlessly
and
you
said
the
usher
gravely
to
pontcalec
who
was
silent
what
do
you
ask
i
said
pontcalec
calmly
i
demand
nothing
then
gentlemen
said
the
usher
this
is
the
answer
of
the
commission
you
have
two
hours
at
your
disposal
to
arrange
your
spiritual
and
temporal
affairs
it
is
now
six
in
two
hours
and
a
half
you
must
be
on
the
place
du
bouffay
where
the
execution
will
take
place
there
was
a
profound
silence
the
bravest
felt
fear
seizing
the
very
roots
of
their
hair
the
usher
retired
without
any
one
having
made
any
answer
only
the
condemned
looked
at
each
other
and
pressed
each
other
hands
they
had
two
hours
two
hours
in
the
ordinary
course
of
life
seem
sometimes
an
age
at
others
two
hours
are
but
a
moment
the
priests
arrived
after
them
the
soldiers
then
the
executioners
the
situation
was
appalling
pontcalec
alone
did
not
belie
himself
not
that
the
others
wanted
courage
but
they
wanted
hope
still
pontcalec
reassured
them
by
the
calmness
with
which
he
addressed
not
only
the
priests
but
the
executioners
themselves
they
made
the
preparations
for
that
terrible
process
called
the
toilet
of
the
condemned
the
four
sufferers
must
proceed
to
the
scaffold
dressed
in
black
cloaks
in
order
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
from
whom
they
always
feared
some
tumult
they
might
be
confounded
with
the
priests
who
exhorted
them
then
the
question
of
tying
their
hands
was
discussed
an
important
question
pontcalec
answered
with
his
smile
of
sublime
confidence
oh
leave
us
at
least
our
hands
free
we
will
go
without
disturbance
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
us
replied
the
executioner
who
was
attending
to
pontcalec
unless
by
special
order
the
rules
are
the
same
for
all
sufferers
and
who
gives
these
orders
said
pontcalec
laughing
the
king
no
marquis
answered
the
executioner
astonished
by
such
unexampled
presence
of
mind
not
the
king
but
our
chief
and
where
is
your
chief
that
is
he
talking
with
the
jailer
christopher
call
him
then
said
pontcalec
ho
monsieur
waters
cried
the
executioner
please
to
come
this
way
there
is
one
of
these
gentlemen
asking
for
you
a
thunderbolt
falling
in
the
midst
of
them
would
not
have
produced
a
more
terrible
effect
upon
the
four
gentlemen
than
did
this
name
what
did
you
say
cried
pontcalec
shaking
with
affright
what
did
you
say
what
name
did
you
pronounce
waters
our
chief
pontcalec
pale
and
overcome
sank
upon
a
chair
casting
an
unutterable
glance
upon
his
affrighted
companions
no
one
around
them
understood
this
sudden
despair
which
so
rapidly
succeeded
to
so
high
a
confidence
well
asked
montlouis
addressing
pontcalec
in
a
tone
of
tender
reproach
yes
gentlemen
you
were
right
said
pontcalec
but
i
also
was
right
to
believe
in
this
prediction
for
it
will
be
accomplished
as
the
others
were
only
this
time
i
yield
and
confess
that
we
are
lost
and
by
a
spontaneous
movement
the
four
gentlemen
threw
themselves
into
each
other
arms
with
fervent
prayers
to
heaven
what
do
you
order
asked
the
executioner
it
is
useless
to
tie
their
hands
if
they
will
give
their
words
of
honor
they
are
soldiers
and
gentlemen
chapter
xxxvii
the
tragedy
of
nantes
meanwhile
gaston
posted
along
the
road
to
nantes
leaving
behind
him
all
postilions
whose
place
then
as
now
was
to
hold
the
horses
instead
of
urging
them
on
he
had
already
passed
sevres
and
versailles
and
on
arriving
at
rambouillet
just
at
daybreak
he
saw
the
innkeeper
and
some
postilions
gathered
round
a
horse
which
had
just
been
bled
the
horse
was
lying
stretched
on
its
side
in
the
middle
of
the
street
breathing
with
difficulty
gaston
at
first
paid
no
attention
to
all
this
but
as
he
was
mounting
himself
he
heard
one
of
the
say
if
he
goes
on
at
that
pace
he
will
kill
more
than
one
between
this
and
nantes
gaston
was
on
the
point
of
starting
but
struck
by
a
sudden
and
terrible
idea
he
stopped
and
signed
to
the
innkeeper
to
come
to
him
the
innkeeper
approached
who
has
passed
by
here
asked
gaston
going
at
such
a
pace
as
to
have
put
that
poor
animal
in
such
a
state
a
courier
of
the
minister
answered
the
innkeeper
a
courier
of
the
minister
exclaimed
gaston
and
coming
from
paris
from
paris
how
long
has
he
passed
more
or
less
about
two
hours
gaston
uttered
a
low
cry
which
was
like
a
groan
he
knew
dubois
dubois
who
had
tricked
him
under
the
disguise
of
la
jonquiere
the
good
will
of
the
minister
recurred
to
his
mind
and
frightened
him
why
this
courier
dispatched
post
haste
just
two
hours
before
himself
oh
i
was
too
happy
thought
the
young
man
and
helene
was
right
when
she
told
me
she
had
a
presentiment
of
some
great
misfortune
oh
i
will
overtake
this
courier
and
learn
the
message
that
he
bears
or
perish
in
the
attempt
and
he
shot
off
like
an
arrow
but
with
all
these
doubts
and
interrogations
he
had
lost
ten
minutes
more
so
that
on
arriving
at
the
first
post
station
he
was
still
two
hours
behind
this
time
the
courier
horse
had
held
out
and
it
was
gaston
which
was
ready
to
drop
the
tried
to
make
some
remarks
but
gaston
dropped
two
or
three
louis
and
set
off
again
at
a
gallop
at
the
next
he
had
gained
a
few
minutes
and
that
was
all
the
courier
who
was
before
him
had
not
slackened
his
pace
gaston
increased
his
own
but
this
frightful
rapidity
redoubled
the
young
fever
and
mistrust
oh
said
he
i
arrive
at
the
same
time
that
he
does
if
i
am
unable
to
precede
him
and
he
doubled
his
speed
and
spurred
on
his
horse
which
at
every
station
stopped
dripping
with
blood
and
sweat
or
tumbled
down
exhausted
at
every
station
he
learned
that
the
courier
had
passed
almost
as
swiftly
as
himself
but
he
always
gained
some
few
minutes
and
that
sustained
his
strength
those
whom
he
passed
upon
the
way
leaving
them
far
behind
pitied
in
spite
of
themselves
the
beautiful
young
man
pale
faced
and
haggard
who
flew
on
thus
and
took
neither
rest
nor
food
dripping
with
sweat
despite
the
bitter
cold
and
whose
parched
lips
could
only
frame
the
words
a
horse
a
horse
quick
there
a
horse
and
in
fact
exhausted
with
no
strength
but
that
supplied
him
by
his
heart
and
maddened
more
and
more
by
the
rapidity
of
his
course
and
the
feeling
of
danger
gaston
felt
his
head
turn
his
temples
throb
and
the
perspiration
of
his
limbs
was
tinged
with
blood
choked
by
the
thirst
and
dryness
of
his
throat
at
ancenis
he
drank
a
glass
of
water
it
was
the
first
moment
he
had
lost
during
sixteen
hours
and
yet
the
accursed
courier
was
still
an
hour
and
a
half
in
advance
in
eighty
leagues
gaston
had
only
gained
some
forty
or
fifty
minutes
the
night
was
drawing
in
rapidly
and
gaston
ever
expecting
to
see
some
object
appear
on
the
horizon
tried
to
pierce
the
obscurity
with
his
bloodshot
glances
on
he
went
as
in
a
dream
thinking
he
heard
the
ringing
of
bells
the
roar
of
cannon
and
the
roll
of
drums
his
brain
was
full
of
mournful
strains
and
inauspicious
sounds
he
lived
no
longer
as
a
man
but
his
fever
kept
him
up
he
flew
as
it
were
in
the
air
on
and
still
on
about
eight
at
night
he
perceived
nantes
at
length
upon
the
horizon
like
a
dark
mass
from
out
the
midst
of
which
some
scattered
lights
were
shining
starlike
in
the
gloom
he
tried
to
breathe
and
thinking
his
cravat
was
choking
him
he
tore
it
off
and
threw
it
on
the
road
thus
mounted
on
his
black
horse
wrapped
in
his
black
cloak
and
long
ago
bareheaded
his
hat
had
fallen
off
gaston
was
like
some
fiendish
cavalier
bound
to
the
witches
sabbath
on
reaching
the
gates
of
nantes
his
horse
stumbled
but
gaston
did
not
lose
his
stirrups
pulled
him
up
sharply
and
driving
the
spurs
into
his
sides
he
made
him
recover
himself
the
night
was
dark
no
one
appeared
upon
the
ramparts
the
very
sentinels
were
hidden
in
the
gloom
it
seemed
like
a
deserted
city
but
as
he
passed
the
gate
a
sentinel
said
something
which
gaston
did
not
even
hear
he
held
on
his
way
at
the
rue
du
chateau
his
horse
stumbled
and
fell
this
time
to
rise
no
more
what
mattered
it
to
gaston
now
he
had
arrived
on
he
went
on
foot
his
limbs
were
strained
and
deadened
yet
he
felt
no
fatigue
he
held
the
paper
crumpled
in
his
hand
one
thing
however
astonished
him
and
that
was
meeting
no
one
in
so
populous
a
quarter
as
he
advanced
however
he
heard
a
sullen
murmur
coming
from
the
place
de
bouffay
as
he
passed
before
a
long
street
which
led
into
that
there
was
a
sea
of
heads
lit
up
by
flaring
lights
but
gaston
passed
on
his
business
was
at
the
castle
and
the
sight
disappeared
at
last
he
saw
the
castle
he
saw
the
door
gaping
wide
before
him
the
sentinel
on
guard
upon
the
drawbridge
tried
to
stop
him
but
gaston
his
order
in
his
hand
pushed
him
roughly
aside
and
entered
the
inner
door
men
were
talking
and
one
of
them
wiping
his
tears
off
as
he
talked
gaston
understood
it
all
a
reprieve
he
cried
a
re
the
word
died
upon
his
lips
but
the
men
had
done
better
than
hear
they
had
seen
his
despairing
gesture
go
go
they
cried
showing
him
the
way
go
and
perhaps
you
may
yet
arrive
in
time
and
they
themselves
dispersed
in
all
directions
gaston
pursued
his
way
he
traversed
a
corridor
then
some
empty
rooms
then
the
great
chamber
and
then
another
corridor
far
off
through
the
bars
by
the
torchlight
he
perceived
the
great
crowd
of
which
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
before
he
had
passed
right
through
the
castle
and
issued
on
a
terrace
thence
he
perceived
the
esplanade
a
scaffold
men
and
all
around
the
crowd
gaston
tried
to
cry
but
no
one
heard
him
he
waved
his
handkerchief
but
no
one
saw
him
another
man
mounts
on
the
scaffold
and
gaston
uttered
a
cry
and
threw
himself
down
below
he
had
leaped
from
the
top
of
the
rampart
to
the
bottom
a
sentinel
tried
to
stop
him
but
he
threw
him
down
and
descended
a
sort
of
staircase
which
led
down
to
the
square
and
at
the
bottom
was
a
sort
of
barricade
of
wagons
gaston
bent
down
and
glided
between
the
wheels
beyond
the
barricade
were
all
simon
grenadiers
a
living
hedge
gaston
with
a
desperate
effort
broke
through
the
line
and
found
himself
inside
the
ring
the
soldiers
seeing
a
man
pale
and
breathless
with
a
paper
in
his
hand
allowed
him
to
pass
all
of
a
sudden
he
stopped
as
if
struck
by
lightning
talhouet
he
saw
him
talhouet
kneeling
on
the
scaffold
stop
stop
cried
gaston
with
all
the
energy
of
despair
but
even
as
he
spoke
the
sword
of
the
executioner
flashed
like
lightning
a
dull
and
heavy
blow
followed
and
a
terrible
shudder
ran
through
all
the
crowd
the
young
man
shriek
was
lost
in
the
general
cry
arising
from
twenty
thousand
palpitating
breasts
at
once
he
had
arrived
a
moment
too
late
talhouet
was
dead
and
as
he
lifted
his
eyes
he
saw
in
the
hand
of
the
headsman
the
bleeding
head
of
his
friend
and
then
in
the
nobility
of
his
heart
he
felt
that
one
being
dead
they
all
should
die
that
not
one
of
them
would
accept
a
pardon
which
arrived
a
head
too
late
he
looked
around
him
du
couëdic
mounted
in
his
turn
clothed
with
his
black
mantle
bareheaded
and
gaston
remembered
that
he
also
had
a
black
mantle
and
that
his
head
and
neck
were
bare
and
he
laughed
convulsively
he
saw
what
remained
for
him
to
do
as
one
sees
some
wild
landscape
by
the
lightning
livid
gleam
is
awful
but
grand
du
couëdic
bends
down
but
as
he
bends
he
cries
see
how
they
recompense
the
services
of
faithful
soldiers
see
how
you
keep
your
promises
oh
ye
cowards
of
bretagne
two
assistants
force
him
on
his
knees
the
sword
of
the
executioner
whirls
round
and
gleams
again
and
du
couëdic
lies
beside
talhouet
the
executioner
takes
up
the
head
shows
it
to
the
people
and
then
places
it
at
one
corner
of
the
scaffold
opposite
that
of
talhouet
who
next
asks
waters
it
matters
little
answers
a
voice
provided
that
monsieur
de
pontcalec
be
the
last
according
to
his
sentence
i
then
said
montlouis
i
and
he
springs
upon
the
scaffold
but
there
he
stops
his
hair
bristling
at
a
window
before
him
he
has
seen
his
wife
and
his
children
montlouis
montlouis
cries
his
wife
with
the
despairing
accent
of
a
breaking
heart
montlouis
look
at
us
at
the
same
moment
all
eyes
were
turned
toward
that
window
soldiers
citizens
priests
and
executioners
look
the
same
way
gaston
profits
by
the
deathlike
silence
which
reigns
around
him
springs
to
the
scaffold
and
grasps
the
staircase
and
mounts
the
first
steps
my
wife
my
children
cries
montlouis
wringing
his
hands
in
despair
oh
go
have
pity
upon
me
montlouis
cries
his
wife
holding
up
afar
the
youngest
of
his
sons
montlouis
bless
your
children
and
one
day
perhaps
one
of
them
will
avenge
you
adieu
my
children
my
blessing
on
you
cries
montlouis
stretching
his
hands
toward
the
window
these
mournful
adieux
pierce
the
night
and
reverberate
like
a
terrible
echo
in
the
hearts
of
the
spectators
enough
says
waters
enough
then
turning
to
his
assistants
be
quick
says
he
or
the
people
will
not
allow
us
to
finish
be
easy
says
montlouis
if
the
people
should
rescue
me
i
would
not
survive
them
and
he
pointed
with
his
finger
to
the
heads
of
his
companions
ah
i
had
estimated
them
rightly
then
cried
gaston
who
heard
these
words
montlouis
martyr
pray
for
me
montlouis
turned
round
he
seemed
to
have
heard
a
voice
but
at
the
very
moment
the
executioner
seized
him
and
almost
instantly
a
loud
cry
told
gaston
that
montlouis
was
like
the
others
and
that
turn
was
come
he
leaped
up
in
a
moment
he
was
on
the
top
of
the
ladder
and
he
in
his
turn
looked
down
from
the
abominable
platform
upon
all
that
crowd
at
three
corners
of
the
scaffold
were
the
heads
of
talhouet
du
couëdic
and
montlouis
but
there
arose
then
a
strange
emotion
in
the
people
the
execution
of
montlouis
attended
by
the
circumstances
we
have
narrated
had
upset
the
crowd
all
the
square
heaving
and
uttering
murmurs
and
imprecations
seemed
to
gaston
some
vast
sea
with
life
in
every
wave
at
this
moment
the
idea
flashed
across
him
that
he
might
be
recognized
and
that
his
name
uttered
by
a
single
mouth
might
prevent
his
carrying
out
his
intention
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
laid
his
head
himself
upon
the
block
adieu
he
murmured
adieu
my
friends
my
tender
dear
helene
thy
nuptial
kiss
has
cost
me
my
life
indeed
but
not
mine
honor
alas
those
fifteen
minutes
wasted
in
thine
arms
will
have
struck
down
five
heads
adieu
helene
adieu
the
sword
of
the
executioner
and
you
my
friends
pardon
me
added
the
young
man
the
steel
fell
the
head
rolled
one
way
and
the
body
fell
the
other
then
waters
raised
the
head
and
showed
it
to
the
people
but
then
a
mighty
murmur
rose
from
the
crowd
no
one
had
recognized
pontcalec
the
executioner
mistook
the
meaning
of
this
murmur
he
placed
head
at
the
empty
corner
and
with
his
foot
pushing
the
body
into
the
tumbril
where
those
of
his
three
companions
awaited
it
he
leaned
upon
his
sword
and
cried
aloud
justice
is
done
and
i
then
cried
a
voice
of
thunder
am
i
to
be
forgotten
and
pontcalec
in
his
turn
leaped
upon
the
scaffold
you
cried
waters
recoiling
as
if
he
had
seen
a
ghost
you
who
are
you
i
said
pontcalec
come
i
am
ready
but
said
the
executioner
trembling
and
looking
one
after
the
other
at
the
four
corners
of
the
scaffold
but
there
are
four
heads
already
i
am
the
baron
de
pontcalec
do
you
hear
i
am
to
die
the
last
and
here
i
am
count
said
waters
as
pale
as
the
baron
pointing
with
his
sword
to
the
four
corners
four
heads
exclaimed
pontcalec
impossible
at
this
moment
he
recognized
in
one
of
the
heads
the
pale
and
noble
face
of
gaston
which
seemed
to
smile
upon
him
even
in
death
and
he
in
his
turn
started
back
in
terror
oh
kill
me
then
quickly
he
cried
groaning
with
impatience
would
you
make
me
die
a
thousand
times
during
this
interval
one
of
the
commissioners
had
mounted
the
ladder
called
by
the
chief
executioner
he
cast
a
glance
upon
pontcalec
it
is
indeed
the
baron
de
pontcalec
said
the
commissioner
perform
your
office
but
cried
the
executioner
there
are
four
heads
there
already
well
then
his
will
make
five
better
too
many
than
too
few
and
the
commissioner
descended
the
steps
signing
to
the
drums
to
beat
waters
reeled
upon
the
boards
of
his
scaffold
the
tumult
increased
the
horror
was
more
than
the
crowd
could
bear
a
long
murmur
ran
along
the
square
the
lights
were
put
out
the
soldiers
driven
back
cried
to
arms
there
was
a
moment
of
noise
and
confusion
and
several
voices
exclaimed
death
to
the
commissioners
death
to
the
executioners
then
the
guns
of
the
fort
loaded
with
grape
were
pointed
toward
the
people
what
shall
i
do
asked
waters
strike
answered
the
same
voice
which
had
always
spoken
pontcalec
threw
himself
on
his
knees
the
assistants
placed
his
head
upon
the
block
then
the
priests
fled
in
horror
the
soldiers
trembled
in
the
gloom
and
waters
as
he
struck
turned
away
his
head
lest
he
should
see
his
victim
ten
minutes
afterward
the
square
was
empty
the
windows
closed
and
dark
the
artillery
and
the
fusiliers
encamped
around
the
demolished
scaffold
looked
in
silence
on
the
spots
of
blood
that
incarnadined
the
pavement
the
priests
to
whom
the
bodies
were
delivered
recognized
that
there
were
indeed
as
waters
had
said
five
bodies
instead
of
four
one
of
the
corpses
still
held
a
crumpled
paper
in
his
hand
this
paper
was
the
pardon
of
the
other
four
then
only
was
all
explained
and
the
devotion
of
gaston
which
he
had
confided
to
no
one
was
divined
the
priests
wished
to
perform
a
mass
but
the
president
chateauneuf
fearing
some
disturbance
at
nantes
ordered
it
to
be
performed
without
pomp
or
ceremony
the
bodies
were
buried
on
the
wednesday
before
easter
the
people
were
not
permitted
to
enter
the
chapel
where
the
mutilated
bodies
reposed
the
greater
part
of
which
report
says
the
quick
lime
refused
to
destroy
and
this
finished
the
tragedy
of
nantes
chapter
xxxviii
the
end
a
fortnight
after
the
events
we
have
just
related
a
queer
carriage
the
same
which
we
saw
arrive
at
paris
at
the
commencement
of
this
history
went
out
at
the
same
barrier
by
which
it
had
entered
and
proceeded
along
the
road
from
paris
to
nantes
a
young
woman
pale
and
almost
dying
was
seated
in
it
by
the
side
of
an
augustine
nun
who
uttered
a
sigh
and
wiped
away
a
tear
every
time
she
looked
at
her
companion
a
man
on
horseback
was
watching
for
the
carriage
a
little
beyond
rambouillet
he
was
wrapped
in
a
large
cloak
which
left
nothing
visible
but
his
eyes
near
him
was
another
man
also
enveloped
in
a
cloak
when
the
carriage
passed
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
two
silent
tears
fell
from
his
eyes
adieu
he
murmured
adieu
all
my
joy
adieu
my
happiness
adieu
helene
my
child
adieu
monseigneur
said
the
man
beside
him
you
must
pay
for
being
a
great
prince
and
he
who
would
govern
others
must
first
conquer
himself
be
strong
to
the
end
monseigneur
and
posterity
will
say
that
you
were
great
oh
i
shall
never
forgive
you
said
the
regent
with
a
sigh
so
deep
it
sounded
like
a
groan
for
you
have
killed
my
happiness
ah
yes
work
for
kings
said
the
companion
of
this
sorrowful
man
shrugging
his
shoulders
fidere
principibus
terræ
nec
filiis
eorum
the
two
men
remained
there
till
the
carriage
had
disappeared
and
then
returned
to
paris
eight
days
afterward
the
carriage
entered
the
porch
of
the
augustines
at
clisson
on
its
arrival
all
the
convent
pressed
round
the
suffering
traveler
poor
floweret
broken
by
the
rough
winds
of
the
world
come
my
child
come
and
live
with
us
again
said
the
superior
not
live
my
mother
said
the
young
girl
but
die
think
only
of
the
lord
my
child
said
the
good
abbess
yes
my
mother
our
lord
who
died
for
the
sins
of
men
helene
returned
to
her
little
cell
from
which
she
had
been
absent
scarcely
a
month
everything
was
still
in
its
place
and
exactly
as
she
had
left
it
she
went
to
the
window
the
lake
was
sleeping
tranquil
and
sad
but
the
ice
which
had
covered
it
had
disappeared
beneath
the
rain
and
with
it
the
snow
where
before
departing
the
young
girl
had
seen
the
impression
of
gaston
footsteps
spring
came
and
everything
but
helene
began
to
live
once
more
the
trees
around
the
little
lake
grew
green
the
large
leaves
of
the
floated
once
more
upon
the
surface
the
reeds
raised
up
their
heads
and
all
the
families
of
warbling
birds
came
back
to
people
them
again
even
the
barred
gate
opened
to
let
the
sturdy
gardener
in
helene
survived
the
summer
but
in
september
she
faded
with
the
waning
of
the
year
and
died
the
very
morning
of
her
death
the
superior
received
a
letter
from
paris
by
a
courier
she
carried
it
to
the
dying
girl
it
contained
only
these
words
my
mother
obtain
from
your
daughter
her
pardon
for
the
regent
helene
implored
by
the
superior
grew
paler
than
ever
at
that
name
but
she
answered
yes
my
mother
i
forgive
him
but
it
is
because
i
go
to
rejoin
him
whom
he
killed
at
four
in
the
afternoon
she
breathed
her
last
she
asked
to
be
buried
at
the
spot
where
gaston
used
to
untie
the
boat
with
which
he
came
to
visit
her
and
her
last
wishes
were
complied
with
and
there
she
sleeps
beneath
the
sod
pure
as
the
flowers
that
blossom
over
her
grave
and
like
them
broken
by
the
cruel
gusts
that
sweep
the
delicate
blossoms
so
mercilessly
down
and
wither
them
with
a
breath
