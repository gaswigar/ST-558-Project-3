chapter
first
visit
to
england
i
have
been
twice
in
england
in
on
my
return
from
a
short
tour
in
sicily
italy
and
france
i
crossed
from
boulogne
and
landed
in
london
at
the
tower
stairs
it
was
a
dark
sunday
morning
there
were
few
people
in
the
streets
and
i
remember
the
pleasure
of
that
first
walk
on
english
ground
with
my
companion
an
american
artist
from
the
tower
up
through
cheapside
and
the
strand
to
a
house
in
russell
square
whither
we
had
been
recommended
to
good
chambers
for
the
first
time
for
many
months
we
were
forced
to
check
the
saucy
habit
of
travellers
criticism
as
we
could
no
longer
speak
aloud
in
the
streets
without
being
understood
the
spoke
our
language
our
country
names
were
on
the
and
the
public
and
private
buildings
wore
a
more
native
and
wonted
front
like
most
young
men
at
that
time
i
was
much
indebted
to
the
men
of
edinburgh
and
of
the
edinburgh
review
to
jeffrey
mackintosh
hallam
and
to
scott
playfair
and
de
quincey
and
my
narrow
and
desultory
reading
had
inspired
the
wish
to
see
the
faces
of
three
or
four
writers
coleridge
wordsworth
landor
de
quincey
and
the
latest
and
strongest
contributor
to
the
critical
journals
carlyle
and
i
suppose
if
i
had
sifted
the
reasons
that
led
me
to
europe
when
i
was
ill
and
was
advised
to
travel
it
was
mainly
the
attraction
of
these
persons
if
goethe
had
been
still
living
i
might
have
wandered
into
germany
also
besides
those
i
have
named
for
scott
was
dead
there
was
not
in
britain
the
man
living
whom
i
cared
to
behold
unless
it
were
the
duke
of
wellington
whom
i
afterwards
saw
at
westminster
abbey
at
the
funeral
of
wilberforce
the
young
scholar
fancies
it
happiness
enough
to
live
with
people
who
can
give
an
inside
to
the
world
without
reflecting
that
they
are
prisoners
too
of
their
own
thought
and
can
not
apply
themselves
to
yours
the
conditions
of
literary
success
are
almost
destructive
of
the
best
social
power
as
they
do
not
leave
that
frolic
liberty
which
only
can
encounter
a
companion
on
the
best
terms
it
is
probable
you
left
some
obscure
comrade
at
a
tavern
or
in
the
farms
with
right
and
equality
to
life
when
you
crossed
sea
and
land
to
play
with
celebrated
scribes
i
have
however
found
writers
superior
to
their
books
and
i
cling
to
my
first
belief
that
a
strong
head
will
dispose
fast
enough
of
these
impediments
and
give
one
the
satisfaction
of
reality
the
sense
of
having
been
met
and
a
larger
horizon
on
looking
over
the
diary
of
my
journey
in
i
find
nothing
to
publish
in
my
memoranda
of
visits
to
places
but
i
have
copied
the
few
notes
i
made
of
visits
to
persons
as
they
respect
parties
quite
too
good
and
too
transparent
to
the
whole
world
to
make
it
needful
to
affect
any
prudery
of
suppression
about
a
few
hints
of
those
bright
personalities
at
florence
chief
among
artists
i
found
horatio
greenough
the
american
sculptor
his
face
was
so
handsome
and
his
person
so
well
formed
that
he
might
be
pardoned
if
as
was
alleged
the
face
of
his
medora
and
the
figure
of
a
colossal
achilles
in
clay
were
idealizations
of
his
own
greenough
was
a
superior
man
ardent
and
eloquent
and
all
his
opinions
had
elevation
and
magnanimity
he
believed
that
the
greeks
had
wrought
in
schools
or
fraternities
the
genius
of
the
master
imparting
his
design
to
his
friends
and
inflaming
them
with
it
and
when
his
strength
was
spent
a
new
hand
with
equal
heat
continued
the
work
and
so
by
relays
until
it
was
finished
in
every
part
with
equal
fire
this
was
necessary
in
so
refractory
a
material
as
stone
and
he
thought
art
would
never
prosper
until
we
left
our
shy
jealous
ways
and
worked
in
society
as
they
all
his
thoughts
breathed
the
same
generosity
he
was
an
accurate
and
a
deep
man
he
was
a
votary
of
the
greeks
and
impatient
of
gothic
art
his
paper
on
architecture
published
in
announced
in
advance
the
leading
thoughts
of
ruskin
on
the
in
architecture
notwithstanding
the
antagonism
in
their
views
of
the
history
of
art
i
have
a
private
letter
from
him
later
but
respecting
the
same
period
in
which
he
roughly
sketches
his
own
theory
here
is
my
theory
of
structure
a
scientific
arrangement
of
spaces
and
forms
to
functions
and
to
site
an
emphasis
of
features
proportioned
to
their
importance
in
function
color
and
ornament
to
be
decided
and
arranged
and
varied
by
strictly
organic
laws
having
a
distinct
reason
for
each
decision
the
entire
and
immediate
banishment
of
all
makeshift
and
greenough
brought
me
through
a
common
friend
an
invitation
from
landor
who
lived
at
san
domenica
di
fiesole
on
the
may
i
dined
with
landor
i
found
him
noble
and
courteous
living
in
a
cloud
of
pictures
at
his
villa
gherardesca
a
fine
house
commanding
a
beautiful
landscape
i
had
inferred
from
his
books
or
magnified
from
some
anecdotes
an
impression
of
achillean
wrath
an
untamable
petulance
i
do
not
know
whether
the
imputation
were
just
or
not
but
certainly
on
this
may
day
his
courtesy
veiled
that
haughty
mind
and
he
was
the
most
patient
and
gentle
of
hosts
he
praised
the
beautiful
cyclamen
which
grows
all
about
florence
he
admired
washington
talked
of
wordsworth
byron
massinger
beaumont
and
fletcher
to
be
sure
he
is
decided
in
his
opinions
likes
to
surprise
and
is
well
content
to
impress
if
possible
his
english
whim
upon
the
immutable
past
no
great
man
ever
had
a
great
son
if
philip
and
alexander
be
not
an
exception
and
philip
he
calls
the
greater
man
in
art
he
loves
the
greeks
and
in
sculpture
them
only
he
prefers
the
venus
to
everything
else
and
after
that
the
head
of
alexander
in
the
gallery
here
he
prefers
john
of
bologna
to
michel
angelo
in
painting
raffaelle
and
shares
the
growing
taste
for
perugino
and
the
early
masters
the
greek
histories
he
thought
the
only
good
and
after
them
voltaire
s
i
could
not
make
him
praise
mackintosh
nor
my
more
recent
friends
montaigne
very
cordially
and
charron
also
which
seemed
undiscriminating
he
thought
degerando
indebted
to
lucas
on
happiness
and
lucas
on
holiness
he
pestered
me
with
southey
but
who
is
southey
he
invited
me
to
breakfast
on
friday
on
friday
i
did
not
fail
to
go
and
this
time
with
greenough
he
entertained
us
at
once
with
reciting
half
a
dozen
hexameter
lines
of
julius
c√¶sar
s
from
donatus
he
said
he
glorified
lord
chesterfield
more
than
was
necessary
and
undervalued
burke
and
undervalued
socrates
designated
as
three
of
the
greatest
of
men
washington
phocion
and
timoleon
much
as
our
pomologists
in
their
lists
select
the
three
or
the
six
best
pears
for
a
small
orchard
and
did
not
even
omit
to
remark
the
similar
termination
of
their
names
a
great
man
he
said
should
make
great
sacrifices
and
kill
his
hundred
oxen
without
knowing
whether
they
would
be
consumed
by
gods
and
heroes
or
whether
the
flies
would
eat
them
i
had
visited
professor
amici
who
had
shown
me
his
microscopes
magnifying
it
was
said
two
thousand
diameters
and
i
spoke
of
the
uses
to
which
they
were
applied
landor
despised
entomology
yet
in
the
same
breath
said
the
sublime
was
in
a
grain
of
dust
i
suppose
i
teased
him
about
recent
writers
but
he
professed
never
to
have
heard
of
herschel
even
by
one
room
was
full
of
pictures
which
he
likes
to
show
especially
one
piece
standing
before
which
he
said
he
would
give
fifty
guineas
to
the
man
that
would
swear
it
was
a
pomenichino
i
was
more
curious
to
see
his
library
but
h
one
of
the
guests
told
me
that
landor
gives
away
his
books
and
has
never
more
than
a
dozen
at
a
time
in
his
house
landor
carries
to
its
height
the
love
of
freak
which
the
english
delight
to
indulge
as
if
to
signalize
their
commanding
freedom
he
has
a
wonderful
brain
despotic
violent
and
inexhaustible
meant
for
a
soldier
by
what
chance
converted
to
letters
in
which
there
is
not
a
style
nor
a
tint
not
known
to
him
yet
with
an
english
appetite
for
action
and
heroes
the
thing
done
avails
and
not
what
is
said
about
it
an
original
sentence
a
step
forward
is
worth
more
than
all
the
censures
landor
is
strangely
undervalued
in
england
usually
ignored
and
sometimes
savagely
attacked
in
the
reviews
the
criticism
may
be
right
or
wrong
and
is
quickly
forgotten
but
year
after
year
the
scholar
must
still
go
back
to
landor
for
a
multitude
of
elegant
sentences
for
wisdom
wit
and
indignation
that
are
unforgetable
from
london
on
the
august
i
went
to
highgate
and
wrote
a
note
to
coleridge
requesting
leave
to
pay
my
respects
to
him
it
was
near
noon
coleridge
sent
a
verbal
message
that
he
was
in
bed
but
if
i
would
call
after
one
o
clock
he
would
see
me
i
returned
at
one
and
he
appeared
a
short
thick
old
man
with
bright
blue
eyes
and
fine
clear
complexion
leaning
on
his
cane
he
took
snuff
freely
which
presently
soiled
his
cravat
and
neat
black
suit
he
asked
whether
i
knew
allston
and
spoke
warmly
of
his
merits
and
doings
when
he
knew
him
in
rome
what
a
master
of
the
titianesque
he
was
etc
he
spoke
of
channing
it
was
an
unspeakable
misfortune
that
he
should
have
turned
out
a
unitarian
after
all
on
this
he
burst
into
a
declamation
on
the
folly
and
ignorance
of
unitarianism
its
high
unreasonableness
and
taking
up
bishop
waterland
s
book
which
lay
on
the
table
he
read
with
vehemence
two
or
three
pages
written
by
himself
in
the
passages
too
which
i
believe
are
printed
in
the
aids
to
reflection
when
he
stopped
to
take
breath
i
interposed
that
whilst
i
highly
valued
all
his
explanations
i
was
bound
to
tell
him
that
i
was
born
and
bred
a
unitarian
yes
he
said
i
supposed
so
and
continued
as
before
it
was
a
wonder
that
after
so
many
ages
of
unquestioning
acquiescence
in
the
doctrine
of
paul
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
which
was
also
according
to
philo
jud√¶us
the
doctrine
of
the
jews
before
christ
this
handful
of
priestleians
should
take
on
themselves
to
deny
it
etc
he
was
very
sorry
that
channing
a
man
to
whom
he
looked
up
no
to
say
that
he
looked
to
him
would
be
to
speak
falsely
but
a
man
whom
he
looked
with
so
much
interest
should
embrace
such
views
when
he
saw
channing
he
had
hinted
to
him
that
he
was
afraid
he
loved
christianity
for
what
was
lovely
and
excellent
he
loved
the
good
in
it
and
not
the
true
and
i
tell
you
sir
that
i
have
known
ten
persons
who
loved
the
good
for
one
person
who
loved
the
true
but
it
is
a
far
greater
virtue
to
love
the
true
for
itself
alone
than
to
love
the
good
for
itself
alone
he
coleridge
knew
all
about
unitarianism
perfectly
well
because
he
had
once
been
a
unitarian
and
knew
what
quackery
it
was
he
had
been
called
the
rising
star
of
unitarianism
he
went
on
defining
or
rather
refining
the
trinitarian
doctrine
was
realism
the
idea
of
god
was
not
essential
but
talked
of
and
and
much
more
of
which
i
only
caught
this
that
the
will
was
that
by
which
a
person
is
a
person
because
if
one
should
push
me
in
the
street
and
so
i
should
force
the
man
next
me
into
the
kennel
i
should
at
once
exclaim
i
did
not
do
it
sir
meaning
it
was
not
my
and
this
also
that
if
you
should
insist
on
your
faith
here
in
england
and
i
on
mine
mine
would
be
the
hotter
side
of
the
i
took
advantage
of
a
pause
to
say
that
he
had
many
readers
of
all
religious
opinions
in
america
and
i
proceeded
to
inquire
if
the
extract
from
the
independent
s
pamphlet
in
the
third
volume
of
the
friend
were
a
veritable
quotation
he
replied
that
it
was
really
taken
from
a
pamphlet
in
his
possession
entitled
a
protest
of
one
of
the
independents
or
something
to
that
effect
i
told
him
how
excellent
i
thought
it
and
how
much
i
wished
to
see
the
entire
work
yes
he
said
the
man
was
a
chaos
of
truths
but
lacked
the
knowledge
that
god
was
a
god
of
order
yet
the
passage
would
no
doubt
strike
you
more
in
the
quotation
than
in
the
original
for
i
have
filtered
it
when
i
rose
to
go
he
said
i
do
not
know
whether
you
care
about
poetry
but
i
will
repeat
some
verses
i
lately
made
on
my
baptismal
anniversary
and
he
recited
with
strong
emphasis
standing
ten
or
twelve
lines
beginning
born
unto
god
in
christ
he
inquired
where
i
had
been
travelling
and
on
learning
that
i
had
been
in
malta
and
sicily
he
compared
one
island
with
the
other
repeating
what
he
had
said
to
the
bishop
of
london
when
he
returned
from
that
country
that
sicily
was
an
excellent
school
of
political
economy
for
in
any
town
there
it
only
needed
to
ask
what
the
government
enacted
and
reverse
to
know
what
ought
to
be
done
it
was
the
most
felicitously
opposite
legislation
to
anything
good
and
wise
there
were
only
three
things
which
the
government
had
brought
into
that
garden
of
delights
namely
itch
pox
and
famine
whereas
in
malta
the
force
of
law
and
mind
was
seen
in
making
that
barren
rock
of
inhabitants
the
seat
of
population
and
going
out
he
showed
me
in
the
next
apartment
a
picture
of
allston
s
and
told
me
that
montague
a
once
came
to
see
him
and
glancing
towards
this
said
well
you
have
got
a
picture
thinking
it
the
work
of
an
old
master
afterwards
montague
still
talking
with
his
back
to
the
canvas
put
up
his
hand
and
touched
it
and
exclaimed
by
heaven
this
picture
is
not
ten
years
old
so
delicate
and
skilful
was
that
man
s
i
was
in
his
company
for
about
an
hour
but
find
it
impossible
to
recall
the
largest
part
of
his
discourse
which
was
often
like
so
many
printed
paragraphs
in
his
book
perhaps
the
same
so
readily
did
he
fall
into
certain
commonplaces
as
i
might
have
foreseen
the
visit
was
rather
a
spectacle
than
a
conversation
of
no
use
beyond
the
satisfaction
of
my
curiosity
he
was
old
and
preoccupied
and
could
not
bend
to
a
new
companion
and
think
with
him
from
edinburgh
i
went
to
the
highlands
on
my
return
i
came
from
glasgow
to
dumfries
and
being
intent
on
delivering
a
letter
which
i
had
brought
from
rome
inquired
for
cragenputtock
it
was
a
farm
in
nithsdale
in
the
parish
of
dunscore
sixteen
miles
distant
no
public
coach
passed
near
it
so
i
took
a
private
carriage
from
the
inn
i
found
the
house
amid
desolate
heathery
hills
where
the
lonely
scholar
nourished
his
mighty
heart
carlyle
was
a
man
from
his
youth
an
author
who
did
not
need
to
hide
from
his
readers
and
as
absolute
a
man
of
the
world
unknown
and
exiled
on
that
as
if
holding
on
his
own
terms
what
is
best
in

he
was
tall
and
gaunt
with
a
brow
and
holding
his
extraordinary
powers
of
conversation
in
easy
command
clinging
to
his
northern
accent
with
evident
relish
full
of
lively
anecdote
and
with
a
streaming
humor
which
floated
everything
he
looked
upon
his
talk
playfully
exalting
the
familiar
objects
put
the
companion
at
once
into
an
acquaintance
with
his
lars
and
lemurs
and
it
was
very
pleasant
to
learn
what
was
predestined
to
be
a
pretty
mythology
few
were
the
objects
and
lonely
the
man
not
a
person
to
speak
to
within
sixteen
miles
except
the
minister
of
dunscore
so
that
books
inevitably
made
his
topics
he
had
names
of
his
own
for
all
the
matters
familiar
to
his
discourse
blackwood

fraser
s
nearer
approach
to
possibility
of
life
was
the
mud
magazine
a
piece
of
road
near
by
that
marked
some
failed
enterprise
was
the
grave
of
the
last
sixpence
when
too
much
praise
of
any
genius
annoyed
him
he
professed
hugely
to
admire
the
talent
shown
by
his
pig
he
had
spent
much
time
and
contrivance
in
confining
the
poor
beast
to
one
enclosure
in
his
pen
but
pig
by
great
strokes
of
judgment
had
found
out
how
to
let
a
board
down
and
had
foiled
him
for
all
that
he
still
thought
man
the
most
plastic
little
fellow
in
the
planet
and
he
liked
nero
s
death
artifex
pereo
better
than
most
history
he
worships
a
man
that
will
manifest
any
truth
to
him
at
one
time
he
had
inquired
and
read
a
good
deal
about
america
landor
s
principle
was
mere
rebellion
and
he
feared
was
the
american
principle
the
best
thing
he
knew
of
that
country
was
that
in
it
a
man
can
have
meat
for
his
labor
he
had
read
in
stewart
s
book
that
when
he
inquired
in
a
new
york
hotel
for
the
boots
he
had
been
shown
across
the
street
and
had
found
mungo
in
his
own
house
dining
on
roast
turkey
we
talked
of
books
plato
he
does
not
read
and
he
disparaged
socrates
and
when
pressed
persisted
in
making
mirabeau
a
hero
gibbon
he
called
the
splendid
bridge
from
the
old
world
to
the
new
his
own
reading
had
been
multifarious
tristram
shandy
was
one
of
his
first
books
after
robinson
crusoe
and
robertson
s
america
an
early
favorite
rousseau
s
confessions
had
discovered
to
him
that
he
was
not
a
dunce
and
it
was
now
ten
years
since
he
had
learned
german
by
the
advice
of
a
man
who
told
him
he
would
find
in
that
language
what
he
wanted
he
took
despairing
or
satirical
views
of
literature
at
this
moment
recounted
the
incredible
sums
paid
in
one
year
by
the
great
booksellers
for
puffing
hence
it
comes
that
no
newspaper
is
trusted
now
no
books
are
bought
and
the
booksellers
are
on
the
eve
of
bankruptcy
he
still
returned
to
english
pauperism
the
crowded
country
the
selfish
abdication
by
public
men
of
all
that
public
persons
should
perform
government
should
direct
poor
men
what
to
do
poor
irish
folk
come
wandering
over
these
moors
my
dame
makes
it
a
rule
to
give
to
every
son
of
adam
bread
to
eat
and
supplies
his
wants
to
the
next
house
but
here
are
thousands
of
acres
which
might
give
them
all
meat
and
nobody
to
bid
these
poor
irish
go
to
the
moor
and
till
it
they
burned
the
stacks
and
so
found
a
way
to
force
the
rich
people
to
attend
to
we
went
out
to
walk
over
long
hills
and
looked
at
criffel
then
without
his
cap
and
down
into
wordsworth
s
country
there
we
sat
down
and
talked
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
it
was
not
carlyle
s
fault
that
we
talked
on
that
topic
for
he
had
the
natural
disinclination
of
every
nimble
spirit
to
bruise
itself
against
walls
and
did
not
like
to
place
himself
where
no
step
can
be
taken
but
he
was
honest
and
true
and
cognizant
of
the
subtile
links
that
bind
ages
together
and
saw
how
every
event
affects
all
the
future
christ
died
on
the
tree
that
built
dunscore
kirk
yonder
that
brought
you
and
me
together
time
has
only
a
relative
he
was
already
turning
his
eyes
towards
london
with
a
scholar
s
appreciation
london
is
the
heart
of
the
world
he
said
wonderful
only
from
the
mass
of
human
beings
he
liked
the
huge
machine
each
keeps
its
own
round
the
baker
s
boy
brings
muffins
to
the
window
at
a
fixed
hour
every
day
and
that
is
all
the
londoner
knows
or
wishes
to
know
on
the
subject
but
it
turned
out
good
men
he
named
certain
individuals
especially
one
man
of
letters
his
friend
the
best
mind
he
knew
whom
london
had
well
served
on
the
august
i
went
to
rydal
mount
to
pay
my
respects
to
wordsworth
his
daughters
called
in
their
father
a
plain
elderly
man
not
prepossessing
and
disfigured
by
green
goggles
he
sat
down
and
talked
with
great
simplicity
he
had
just
returned
from
a
journey
his
health
was
good
but
he
had
broken
a
tooth
by
a
fall
when
walking
with
two
lawyers
and
had
said
that
he
was
glad
it
did
not
happen
forty
years
ago
whereupon
they
had
praised
his
philosophy
he
had
much
to
say
of
america
the
more
that
it
gave
occasion
for
his
favorite
topic
that
society
is
being
enlightened
by
a
superficial
tuition
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
being
restrained
by
moral
culture
schools
do
no
good
tuition
is
not
education
he
thinks
more
of
the
education
of
circumstances
than
of
tuition
t
is
not
a
question
whether
there
are
offences
of
which
the
law
takes
cognizance
but
whether
there
are
offences
of
which
the
law
does
not
take
cognizance
sin
is
what
he
fears
and
how
society
is
to
escape
without
gravest
mischiefs
from
this
source
he
has
even
said
what
seemed
a
paradox
that
they
needed
a
civil
war
in
america
to
teach
the
necessity
of
knitting
the
social
ties
stronger
there
may
be
he
said
in
america
some
vulgarity
in
manner
but
that
s
not
important
that
comes
of
the
pioneer
state
of
things
but
i
fear
they
are
too
much
given
to
the
making
of
money
and
secondly
to
politics
that
they
make
political
distinction
the
end
and
not
the
means
and
i
fear
they
lack
a
class
of
men
of
leisure
in
short
of
gentlemen
to
give
a
tone
of
honor
to
the
community
i
am
told
that
things
are
boasted
of
in
the
second
class
of
society
there
which
in
england
god
knows
are
done
in
england
every
day
but
would
never
be
spoken
of
in
america
i
wish
to
know
not
how
many
churches
or
schools
but
what
newspapers
my
friend
colonel
hamilton
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
who
was
a
year
in
america
assures
me
that
the
newspapers
are
atrocious
and
accuse
members
of
congress
of
stealing
spoons
he
was
against
taking
off
the
tax
on
newspapers
in
england
which
the
reformers
represent
as
a
tax
upon
knowledge
for
this
reason
that
they
would
be
inundated
with
base
prints
he
said
he
talked
on
political
aspects
for
he
wished
to
impress
on
me
and
all
good
americans
to
cultivate
the
moral
the
conservative
and
never
to
call
into
action
the
physical
strength
of
the
people
as
had
just
now
been
done
in
england
in
the
reform
bill
a
thing
prophesied
by
delolme
he
alluded
once
or
twice
to
his
conversation
with
channing
who
had
recently
visited
him
laying
his
hand
on
a
particular
chair
in
which
the
doctor
had
sat
the
conversation
turned
on
books
lucretius
he
esteems
a
far
higher
poet
than
virgil
not
in
his
system
which
is
nothing
but
in
his
power
of
illustration
faith
is
necessary
to
explain
anything
and
to
reconcile
the
foreknowledge
of
god
with
human
evil
of
cousin
whose
lectures
we
had
all
been
reading
in
boston
he
knew
only
the
name
i
inquired
if
he
had
read
carlyle
s
critical
articles
and
translations
he
said
he
thought
him
sometimes
insane
he
proceeded
to
abuse
goethe
s
wilhelm
meister
heartily
it
was
full
of
all
manner
of
fornication
it
was
like
the
crossing
of
flies
in
the
air
he
had
never
gone
further
than
the
first
part
so
disgusted
was
he
that
he
threw
the
book
across
the
room
i
deprecated
this
wrath
and
said
what
i
could
for
the
better
parts
of
the
book
and
he
courteously
promised
to
look
at
it
again
carlyle
he
said
wrote
most
obscurely
he
was
clever
and
deep
but
he
defied
the
sympathies
of
everybody
even
coleridge
wrote
more
clearly
though
he
had
always
wished
coleridge
would
write
more
to
be
understood
he
led
me
out
into
his
garden
and
showed
me
the
in
which
thousands
of
his
lines
were
composed
his
eyes
are
much
inflamed
this
is
no
loss
except
for
reading
because
he
never
writes
prose
and
of
poetry
he
carries
even
hundreds
of
lines
in
his
head
before
writing
them
he
had
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
staffa
and
within
three
days
had
made
three
sonnets
on
fingal
s
cave
and
was
composing
a
fourth
when
he
was
called
in
to
see
me
he
said
if
you
are
interested
in
my
verses
perhaps
you
will
like
to
hear
these
lines
i
gladly
assented
and
he
recollected
himself
for
a
few
moments
and
then
stood
forth
and
repeated
one
after
the
other
the
three
entire
sonnets
with
great
animation
i
fancied
the
second
and
third
more
beautiful
than
his
poems
are
wont
to
be
the
third
is
addressed
to
the
flowers
which
he
said
especially
the
daisy
are
very
abundant
on
the
top
of
the
rock
the
second
alludes
to
the
name
of
the
cave
which
is
cave
of
music
the
first
to
the
circumstance
of
its
being
visited
by
the
promiscuous
company
of
the
steamboat
this
recitation
was
so
unlooked
for
and
surprising
he
the
old
wordsworth
standing
apart
and
reciting
to
me
in
a
like
a
declaiming
that
i
at
first
was
near
to
laugh
but
recollecting
myself
that
i
had
come
thus
far
to
see
a
poet
and
he
was
chanting
poems
to
me
i
saw
that
he
was
right
and
i
was
wrong
and
gladly
gave
myself
up
to
hear
i
told
him
how
much
the
few
printed
extracts
had
quickened
the
desire
to
possess
his
unpublished
poems
he
replied
he
never
was
in
haste
to
publish
partly
because
he
corrected
a
good
deal
and
every
alteration
is
ungraciously
received
after
printing
but
what
he
had
written
would
be
printed
whether
he
lived
or
died
i
said
tintern
abbey
appeared
to
be
the
favorite
poem
with
the
public
but
more
contemplative
readers
preferred
the
first
books
of
the
excursion
and
the
sonnets
he
said
yes
they
are
better
he
preferred
such
of
his
poems
as
touched
the
affections
to
any
others
for
whatever
is
didactic
what
theories
of
society
and
so
on
might
perish
quickly
but
whatever
combined
a
truth
with
an
affection
was
greek
es
good
and
good
forever
he
cited
the
sonnet
on
the
feelings
of
a
spaniard
which
he
preferred
to
any
other
i
so
understood
him
and
the
two
voices
and
quoted
with
evident
pleasure
the
verses
addressed
to
the
skylark
in
this
connection
he
said
of
the
newtonian
theory
that
it
might
yet
be
superseded
and
forgotten
and
dalton
s
atomic
theory
when
i
prepared
to
depart
he
said
he
wished
to
show
me
what
a
common
person
in
england
could
do
and
he
led
me
into
the
enclosure
of
his
clerk
a
young
man
to
whom
he
had
given
this
slip
of
ground
which
was
laid
out
or
its
natural
capabilities
shown
with
much
taste
he
then
said
he
would
show
me
a
better
way
towards
the
inn
and
he
walked
a
good
part
of
a
mile
talking
and
ever
and
anon
stopping
short
to
impress
the
word
or
the
verse
and
finally
parted
from
me
with
great
kindness
and
returned
across
the
fields
wordsworth
honored
himself
by
his
simple
adherence
to
truth
and
was
very
willing
not
to
shine
but
he
surprised
by
the
hard
limits
of
his
thought
to
judge
from
a
single
conversation
he
made
the
impression
of
a
narrow
and
very
english
mind
of
one
who
paid
for
his
rare
elevation
by
general
tameness
and
conformity
off
his
own
beat
his
opinions
were
of
no
value
it
is
not
very
rare
to
find
persons
loving
sympathy
and
ease
who
expiate
their
departure
from
the
common
in
one
direction
by
their
conformity
in
every
other
chapter
voyage
to
england
the
occasion
of
my
second
visit
to
england
was
an
invitation
from
some
mechanics
institutes
in
lancashire
and
yorkshire
which
separately
are
organized
much
in
the
same
way
as
our
new
england
lyceums
but
in
had
been
linked
into
a
union
which
embraced
twenty
or
thirty
towns
and
cities
and
presently
extended
into
the
middle
counties
and
northward
into
scotland
i
was
invited
on
liberal
terms
to
read
a
series
of
lectures
in
them
all
the
request
was
urged
with
every
kind
suggestion
and
every
assurance
of
aid
and
comfort
by
friendliest
parties
in
manchester
who
in
the
sequel
amply
redeemed
their
word
the
remuneration
was
equivalent
to
the
fees
at
that
time
paid
in
this
country
for
the
like
services
at
all
events
it
was
sufficient
to
cover
any
travelling
expenses
and
the
proposal
offered
an
excellent
opportunity
of
seeing
the
interior
of
england
and
scotland
by
means
of
a
home
and
a
committee
of
intelligent
friends
awaiting
me
in
every
town
i
did
not
go
very
willingly
i
am
not
a
good
traveller
nor
have
i
found
that
long
journeys
yield
a
fair
share
of
reasonable
hours
but
the
invitation
was
repeated
and
pressed
at
a
moment
of
more
leisure
and
when
i
was
a
little
spent
by
some
unusual
studies
i
wanted
a
change
and
a
tonic
and
england
was
proposed
to
me
besides
there
were
at
least
the
dread
attraction
and
salutary
influences
of
the
sea
so
i
took
my
berth
in
the
washington
irving
and
sailed
from
boston
on
tuesday
october
on
friday
at
noon
we
had
only
made
one
hundred
and
miles
a
nimble
indian
would
have
swum
as
far
but
the
captain
affirmed
that
the
ship
would
show
us
in
time
all
her
paces
and
we
crept
along
through
the
floating
drift
of
boards
logs
and
chips
which
the
rivers
of
maine
and
new
brunswick
pour
into
the
sea
after
a
freshet
at
last
on
sunday
night
after
doing
one
day
s
work
in
four
the
storm
came
the
winds
blew
and
we
flew
before
a
northwester
which
strained
every
rope
and
sail
the
good
ship
darts
through
the
water
all
day
all
night
like
a
fish
quivering
with
speed
gliding
through
liquid
leagues
sliding
from
horizon
to
horizon
she
has
passed
cape
sable
she
has
reached
the
banks
the
are
left
gulls
haglets
ducks
petrels
swim
dive
and
hover
around
no
fishermen
she
has
passed
the
banks
left
five
sail
behind
her
far
on
the
edge
of
the
west
at
sundown
which
were
far
east
of
us
at
morn
though
they
say
at
sea
a
stern
chase
is
a
long
race
and
still
we
fly
for
our
lives
the
shortest
from
boston
to
liverpool
is
miles
this
a
steamer
keeps
and
saves
miles
a
sailing
ship
can
never
go
in
a
shorter
line
than
and
usually
it
is
much
longer
our
good
master
keeps
his
kites
up
to
the
last
moment
alow
and
aloft
and
by
incessant
straight
steering
never
loses
a
rod
of
way
watchfulness
is
the
law
of
the
ship
watch
on
watch
for
advantage
and
for
life
since
the
ship
was
built
it
seems
the
master
never
slept
but
in
his
whilst
on
board
there
are
many
advantages
says
saadi
in
but
security
is
not
one
of
them
yet
in
hurrying
over
these
abysses
whatever
dangers
we
are
running
into
we
are
certainly
running
out
of
the
risks
of
hundreds
of
miles
every
day
which
have
their
own
chances
of
squall
collision
piracy
cold
and
thunder
hour
for
hour
the
risk
on
a
steamboat
is
greater
but
the
speed
is
safety
or
twelve
days
of
danger
instead
of
our
ship
was
registered
tons
and
weighed
perhaps
with
all
her
freight
tons
the
mainmast
from
the
deck
to
the
measured
feet
the
length
of
the
deck
from
stem
to
stern
it
is
impossible
not
to
personify
a
ship
everybody
does
in
everything
they
say
she
behaves
well
she
minds
her
rudder
she
swims
like
a
duck
she
runs
her
nose
into
the
water
she
looks
into
a
port
then
that
wonderful
du
by
which
we
adopt
into
our
everything
we
touch
makes
us
all
champions
of
her
the
conscious
ship
hears
all
the
praise
in
one
week
she
has
made
miles
and
now
at
night
seems
to
hear
the
steamer
behind
her
which
left
boston
at
two
has
mended
her
speed
and
is
flying
before
the
gray
eleven
and
a
half
knots
the
hour
the
shines
in
her
wake
and
far
around
wherever
a
wave
breaks
i
read
the
hour
on
my
watch
by
this
light
near
the
equator
you
can
read
small
print
by
it
and
the
mate
describes
the
phosphoric
insects
when
taken
up
in
a
pail
as
shaped
like
a
carolina
potato
i
find
the
an
acquired
taste
like
that
for
tomatoes
and
olives
the
confinement
cold
motion
noise
and
odor
are
not
to
be
dispensed
with
the
floor
of
your
room
is
sloped
at
an
angle
of
twenty
or
thirty
degrees
and
i
waked
every
morning
with
the
belief
that
some
one
was
tipping
up
my
berth
nobody
likes
to
be
treated
ignominiously
upset
shoved
against
the
side
of
the
house
rolled
over
suffocated
with
bilge
mephitis
and
stewing
oil
we
get
used
to
these
annoyances
at
last
but
the
dread
of
the
sea
remains
longer
the
sea
is
masculine
the
type
of
active
strength
look
what
eggshells
are
drifting
all
over
it
each
one
like
ours
filled
with
men
in
ecstasies
of
terror
alternating
with
cockney
conceit
as
the
sea
is
rough
or
smooth
is
this
circle
an
eternal
cemetery
in
our
graveyards
we
scoop
a
pit
but
this
aggressive
water
opens
pits
and
chasms
and
makes
a
mouthful
of
a
fleet
to
the
geologist
the
sea
is
the
only
firmament
the
land
is
in
perpetual
flux
and
change
now
blown
up
like
a
tumor
now
sunk
in
a
chasm
and
the
registered
observations
of
a
few
hundred
years
find
it
in
a
perpetual
tilt
rising
and
falling
the
sea
keeps
its
old
level
and
t
is
no
wonder
that
the
history
of
our
race
is
so
recent
if
the
roar
of
the
ocean
is
silencing
our
traditions
a
rising
of
the
sea
such
as
has
been
observed
say
an
inch
in
a
century
from
east
to
west
on
the
land
will
bury
all
the
towns
monuments
bones
and
knowledge
of
mankind
steadily
and
insensibly
if
it
is
capable
of
these
great
and
secular
mischiefs
it
is
quite
as
ready
at
private
and
local
damage
and
of
this
no
landsman
seems
so
fearful
as
the
seaman
such
discomfort
and
such
danger
as
the
narratives
of
the
captain
and
mate
disclose
are
bad
enough
as
the
costly
fee
we
pay
for
entrance
to
europe
but
the
wonder
is
always
new
that
any
sane
man
can
be
a
sailor
and
here
on
the
second
day
of
our
voyage
stepped
out
a
little
boy
in
his
who
had
hid
himself
whilst
the
ship
was
in
port
in
the
having
no
money
and
wishing
to
go
to
england
the
sailors
have
dressed
him
in
guernsey
frock
with
a
knife
in
his
belt
and
he
is
climbing
nimbly
about
after
them
likes
the
work
and
if
the
captain
will
take
him
means
now
to
come
back
again
in
the
ship
the
mate
avers
that
this
is
the
history
of
all
sailors
nine
out
of
ten
are
runaway
boys
and
adds
that
all
of
them
are
sick
of
the
sea
but
stay
in
it
out
of
pride
jack
has
a
life
of
risks
incessant
abuse
and
the
worst
pay
it
is
a
little
better
with
the
mate
and
not
very
much
better
with
the
captain
a
hundred
dollars
a
month
is
reckoned
high
pay
if
sailors
were
contented
if
they
had
not
resolved
again
and
again
not
to
go
to
sea
any
more
i
should
respect
them
of
course
the
inconveniences
and
terrors
of
the
sea
are
not
of
any
account
to
those
whose
minds
are
preoccupied
the
arctic
frost
the
mountain
the
mine
only
shatter
cockneyism
every
noble
activity
makes
room
for
itself
a
great
mind
is
a
good
sailor
as
a
great
heart
is
and
the
sea
is
not
slow
in
disclosing
inestimable
secrets
to
a
good
naturalist
tis
a
good
rule
in
every
journey
to
provide
some
piece
of
liberal
study
to
rescue
the
hours
which
bad
weather
bad
company
and
taverns
steal
from
the
best
economist
classics
which
at
home
are
drowsily
read
have
a
strange
charm
in
a
country
inn
or
in
the
transom
of
a
merchant
brig
i
remember
that
some
of
the
happiest
and
most
valuable
hours
i
have
owed
to
books
passed
many
years
ago
on
shipboard
the
worst
impediment
i
have
found
at
sea
is
the
want
of
light
in
the
cabin
we
found
on
board
the
usual
cabin
library
basil
hall
dumas
dickens
bulwer
balzac
and
sand
were
our
among
the
passengers
there
was
some
variety
of
talent
and
profession
we
exchanged
our
experiences
and
all
learned
something
the
busiest
talk
with
leisure
and
convenience
at
sea
and
sometimes
a
memorable
fact
turns
up
which
you
have
long
had
a
vacant
niche
for
and
seize
with
the
joy
of
a
collector
but
under
the
best
conditions
a
voyage
is
one
of
the
severest
tests
to
try
a
man
a
college
examination
is
nothing
to
it
are
long
these
joyless
days
which
whistled
over
us
but
they
were
few
only
fifteen
as
the
captain
counted
sixteen
according
to
me
reckoned
from
the
time
when
we
left
soundings
our
speed
was
such
that
the
captain
drew
the
line
of
his
course
in
red
ink
on
his
chart
for
the
encouragement
or
envy
of
future
navigators
it
has
been
said
that
the
king
of
england
would
consult
his
dignity
by
giving
audience
to
foreign
ambassadors
in
the
cabin
of
a
and
i
think
the
white
path
of
an
atlantic
ship
the
right
avenue
to
the
palace
front
of
this
people
who
for
hundreds
of
years
claimed
the
strict
sovereignty
of
the
sea
and
exacted
toll
and
the
striking
sail
from
the
ships
of
all
other
peoples
when
their
privilege
was
disputed
by
the
dutch
and
other
junior
marines
on
the
plea
that
you
could
never
anchor
on
the
same
wave
or
hold
property
in
what
was
always
flowing
the
english
did
not
stick
to
claim
the
channel
or
bottom
of
all
the
main
as
if
said
they
we
contended
for
the
drops
of
the
sea
and
not
for
its
situation
or
the
bed
of
those
waters
the
sea
is
bounded
by
his
majesty
s
empire
as
we
neared
the
land
its
genius
was
felt
this
was
inevitably
the
british
side
in
every
man
s
thought
arises
now
a
new
system
english
sentiments
english
loves
and
fears
english
history
and
social
modes
yesterday
every
passenger
had
measured
the
speed
of
the
ship
by
watching
the
bubbles
over
the
ship
s
bulwarks
instead
of
bubbles
we
measure
by
kinsale
cork
waterford
and
ardmore
there
lay
the
green
shore
of
ireland
like
some
coast
of
plenty
we
could
see
towns
towers
churches
harvests
but
the
curse
of
eight
hundred
years
we
could
not
discern
chapter
land
alfieri
thought
italy
and
england
the
only
countries
worth
living
in
the
former
because
there
nature
vindicates
her
rights
and
triumphs
over
the
evils
inflicted
by
the
governments
the
latter
because
art
conquers
nature
and
transforms
a
rude
ungenial
land
into
a
paradise
of
comfort
and
plenty
england
is
a
garden
under
an
sky
the
fields
have
been
combed
and
rolled
till
they
appear
to
have
been
finished
with
a
pencil
instead
of
a
plough
the
solidity
of
the
structures
that
compose
the
towns
speaks
the
industry
of
ages
nothing
is
left
as
it
was
made
rivers
hills
valleys
the
sea
itself
feel
the
hand
of
a
master
the
long
habitation
of
a
powerful
and
ingenious
race
has
turned
every
rood
of
land
to
its
best
use
has
found
all
the
capabilities
the
arable
soil
the
quarriable
rock
the
highways
the
byways
the
fords
the
navigable
waters
and
the
new
arts
of
intercourse
meet
you
everywhere
so
that
england
is
a
huge
phalanstery
where
all
that
man
wants
is
provided
within
the
precinct
cushioned
and
comforted
in
every
manner
the
traveller
rides
as
on
a
high
and
low
over
rivers
and
towns
through
mountains
in
tunnels
of
three
or
four
miles
at
near
twice
the
speed
of
our
trains
and
reads
quietly
the
newspaper
which
by
its
immense
correspondence
and
reporting
seems
to
have
machinized
the
rest
of
the
world
for
his
occasion
the
problem
of
the
traveller
landing
at
liverpool
is
why
england
is
england
what
are
the
elements
of
that
power
which
the
english
hold
over
other
nations
if
there
be
one
test
of
national
genius
universally
accepted
it
is
success
and
if
there
be
one
successful
country
in
the
universe
for
the
last
millennium
that
country
is
england
a
wise
traveller
will
naturally
choose
to
visit
the
best
of
actual
nations
and
an
american
has
more
reasons
than
another
to
draw
him
to
britain
in
all
that
is
done
or
begun
by
the
americans
towards
right
thinking
or
practice
we
are
met
by
a
civilization
already
settled
and
overpowering
the
culture
of
the
day
the
thoughts
and
aims
of
men
are
english
thoughts
and
aims
a
nation
considerable
for
a
thousand
years
since
egbert
it
has
in
the
last
centuries
obtained
the
ascendant
and
stamped
the
knowledge
activity
and
power
of
mankind
with
its
impress
those
who
resist
it
do
not
feel
it
or
obey
it
less
the
russian
in
his
snows
is
aiming
to
be
english
the
turk
and
chinese
also
are
making
awkward
efforts
to
be
english
the
practical
of
modern
society
the
utilitarian
direction
which
labor
laws
opinion
religion
take
is
the
natural
genius
of
the
british
mind
the
influence
of
france
is
a
constituent
of
modern
civility
but
not
enough
opposed
to
the
english
for
the
most
wholesome
effect
the
american
is
only
the
continuation
of
the
english
genius
into
new
conditions
more
or
less
propitious
see
what
books
fill
our
libraries
every
book
we
read
every
biography
play
romance
in
whatever
form
is
still
english
history
and
manners
so
that
a
sensible
englishman
once
said
to
me
as
long
as
you
do
not
grant
us
copyright
we
shall
have
the
teaching
of
you
but
we
have
the
same
difficulty
in
making
a
social
or
moral
estimate
of
england
as
the
sheriff
finds
in
drawing
a
jury
to
try
some
cause
which
has
agitated
the
whole
community
and
on
which
everybody
finds
himself
an
interested
party
officers
jurors
judges
have
all
taken
sides
england
has
inoculated
all
nations
with
her
civilization
intelligence
and
tastes
and
to
resist
the
tyranny
and
prepossession
of
the
british
element
a
serious
man
must
aid
himself
by
comparing
with
it
the
civilizations
of
the
farthest
east
and
west
the
old
greek
the
oriental
and
much
more
the
ideal
standard
if
only
by
means
of
the
very
impatience
which
english
forms
are
sure
to
awaken
in
independent
minds
besides
if
we
will
visit
london
the
present
time
is
the
best
time
as
some
signs
portend
that
it
has
reached
its
highest
point
it
is
observed
that
the
english
interest
us
a
little
less
within
a
few
years
and
hence
the
impression
that
the
british
power
has
culminated
is
in
solstice
or
already
declining
as
soon
as
you
enter
england
which
with
wales
is
no
larger
than
the
state
of
georgia
this
little
land
stretches
by
an
illusion
to
the
dimensions
of
an
empire
the
innumerable
details
the
crowded
succession
of
towns
cities
cathedrals
castles
and
great
and
decorated
estates
the
number
and
power
of
the
trades
and
guilds
the
military
strength
and
splendor
the
multitudes
of
rich
and
of
remarkable
people
the
servants
and
equipages
all
these
catching
the
eye
and
never
allowing
it
to
pause
hide
all
boundaries
by
the
impression
of
magnificence
and
endless
wealth
add
south
carolina
and
you
have
more
than
an
equivalent
for
the
area
of
scotland
i
reply
to
all
the
urgencies
that
refer
me
to
this
and
that
object
indispensably
to
be
seen
yes
to
see
england
well
needs
a
hundred
years
for
what
they
told
me
was
the
merit
of
sir
john
soane
s
museum
in
london
that
it
was
well
packed
and
well
saved
is
the
merit
of
england
it
is
stuffed
full
in
all
corners
and
crevices
with
towns
towers
churches
villas
palaces
hospitals
and
in
the
history
of
art
it
is
a
long
way
from
a
cromlech
to
york
minster
yet
all
the
intermediate
steps
may
still
be
traced
in
this
island
the
territory
has
a
singular
perfection
the
climate
is
warmer
by
many
degrees
than
it
is
entitled
to
by
latitude
neither
hot
nor
cold
there
is
no
hour
in
the
whole
year
when
one
can
not
work
here
is
no
winter
but
such
days
as
we
have
in
massachusetts
in
november
a
temperature
which
makes
no
exhausting
demand
on
human
strength
but
allows
the
attainment
of
the
largest
stature
charles
the
second
said
it
invited
men
abroad
more
days
in
the
year
and
more
hours
in
the
day
than
another
country
then
england
has
all
the
materials
of
a
working
country
except
wood
the
constant
rain
a
rain
with
every
tide
in
some
parts
of
the
island
keeps
its
multitude
of
rivers
full
and
brings
agricultural
production
up
to
the
highest
point
it
has
plenty
of
water
of
stone
of
potter
s
clay
of
coal
of
salt
and
of
iron
the
land
naturally
abounds
with
game
immense
heaths
and
downs
are
paved
with
quails
grouse
and
woodcock
and
the
shores
are
animated
by
the
rivers
and
the
surrounding
sea
spawn
with
fish
there
are
salmon
for
the
rich
and
sprats
and
herrings
for
the
poor
in
the
northern
lochs
the
herring
are
in
innumerable
shoals
at
one
season
the
country
people
say
the
lakes
contain
one
part
water
and
two
parts
fish
the
only
drawback
on
this
industrial
conveniency
is
the
darkness
of
its
sky
the
night
and
day
are
too
nearly
of
a
color
it
strains
the
eyes
to
read
and
to
write
add
the
in
the
manufacturing
towns
the
fine
soot
or
blacks
darken
the
day
give
white
sheep
the
color
of
black
sheep
discolor
the
human
saliva
contaminate
the
air
poison
many
plants
and
corrode
the
monuments
and
buildings
the
london
fog
aggravates
the
distempers
of
the
sky
and
sometimes
justifies
the
epigram
on
the
climate
by
an
english
wit
in
a
fine
day
looking
up
a
chimney
in
a
foul
day
looking
down
one
a
gentleman
in
liverpool
told
me
that
he
found
he
could
do
without
a
fire
in
his
parlor
about
one
day
in
the
year
it
is
however
pretended
that
the
enormous
consumption
of
coal
in
the
island
is
also
felt
in
modifying
the
general
climate
factitious
climate
factitious
position
england
resembles
a
ship
in
its
shape
and
if
it
were
one
its
best
admiral
could
not
have
worked
it
or
anchored
it
in
a
more
judicious
or
effective
position
sir
john
herschel
said
london
was
the
centre
of
the
terrene
globs
the
shopkeeping
nation
to
use
a
shop
word
has
a
the
old
venetians
pleased
themselves
with
the
flattery
that
venice
was
in
midway
between
the
poles
and
the
line
as
if
that
were
an
imperial
centrality
long
of
old
the
greeks
fancied
delphi
the
navel
of
the
earth
in
their
favorite
mode
of

this

did
he
on

with

settle

the

at
the

of

in

of

are
as

as

each

shades
down
imperceptibly
into

london
the
british
empire
is
reckoned
to
contain
in
souls
perhaps
a
fifth
of
the
population
of
the
globe
and
to
comprise
a
territory
of
square
miles
so
far
have
british
people
predominated
perhaps
forty
of
these
millions
are
of
british
stock
add
the
united
states
of
america
which
reckon
in
the
same
year
exclusive
of
slaves
of
people
on
a
territory
of
square
miles
and
in
which
the
foreign
element
however
considerable
is
rapidly
assimilated
and
you
have
a
population
of
english
descent
and
language
of
and
governing
a
population
of
souls
the
british
census
proper
reckons
and
a
half
millions
in
the
home
countries
what
makes
this
census
important
is
the
quality
of
the
units
that
compose
it
they
are
free
forcible
men
in
a
country
where
life
is
safe
and
has
reached
the
greatest
value
they
give
the
bias
to
the
current
age
and
that
not
by
chance
or
by
mass
but
by
their
character
and
by
the
number
of
individuals
among
them
of
personal
ability
it
has
been
denied
that
the
english
have
genius
be
it
as
it
may
men
of
vast
intellect
have
been
born
on
their
soil
and
they
have
made
or
applied
the
principal
inventions
they
have
sound
bodies
and
supreme
endurance
in
war
and
in
labor
the
spawning
force
of
the
race
has
sufficed
to
the
colonization
of
great
parts
of
the
world
yet
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
they
can
make
good
the
exodus
of
millions
from
great
britain
amounting
in
to
more
than
a
thousand
a
day
they
have
assimilating
force
since
they
are
imitated
by
their
foreign
subjects
and
they
are
still
aggressive
and
propagandist
enlarging
the
dominion
of
their
arts
and
liberty
their
laws
are
hospitable
and
slavery
does
not
exist
under
them
what
oppression
exists
is
incidental
and
temporary
their
success
is
not
sudden
or
fortunate
but
they
have
maintained
constancy
and
for
many
ages
is
this
power
due
to
their
race
or
to
some
other
cause
men
hear
gladly
of
the
power
of
blood
or
race
everybody
likes
to
know
that
his
advantages
can
not
be
attributed
to
air
soil
sea
or
to
local
wealth
as
mines
and
quarries
nor
to
laws
and
traditions
nor
to
fortune
but
to
superior
brain
as
it
makes
the
praise
more
personal
to
him
we
anticipate
in
the
doctrine
of
race
something
like
that
law
of
physiology
that
whatever
bone
muscle
or
essential
organ
is
found
in
one
healthy
individual
the
same
part
or
organ
may
be
found
in
or
near
the
same
place
in
its
congener
and
we
look
to
find
in
the
son
every
mental
and
moral
property
that
existed
in
the
ancestor
in
race
it
is
not
the
broad
shoulders
or
litheness
or
stature
that
give
advantage
but
a
symmetry
that
reaches
as
far
as
to
the
wit
then
the
miracle
and
renown
begin
then
first
we
care
to
examine
the
pedigree
and
copy
needfully
the
training
what
food
they
ate
what
nursing
school
and
exercises
they
had
which
resulted
in
this
delicacy
of
thought
and
robust
wisdom
how
came

what

the

the

for
it
is
certain
that
these
men
are
samples
of
their
contemporaries
the
hearing
ear
is
always
found
close
to
the
speaking
tongue
and
no
genius
can
long
or
often
utter
anything
which
is
not
invited
and
gladly
entertained
by
men
around
him
it
is
race
is
it
not
that
puts
the
hundred
millions
of
india
under
the
dominion
of
a
remote
island
in
the
north
of

race
avails
much
if
that
be

which
is

that
all

that

love

for

race

appalling
importance
the
french
in

cut
off
from
all
intercourse
with

people
have
held
their
national
traits
i
chanced
to
read
tacitus
on
the
manners
of
the
germans
not
long
since
in
missouri
and
the
heart
of
illinois
and
i
found
abundant
points
of
resemblance
between
the
germans
of
the
hercynian
forest
and
our
and
of
the
american
woods
but
whilst
race
works
immortally
to
keep
its
own
it
is
resisted
by
other
forces
civilization
is
a
and
eats
away
the
old
traits
the
arabs
of
are
the
arabs
of
pharaoh
but
the
briton
of
is
a
very
different
person
from
cassibelaunus
or
ossian
each
religious
sect
has
its
physiognomy
the
methodists
have
acquired
a
face
the
quakers
a

a

an
englishman
will
pick
out
a
dissenter
by
his
manners
trades
and
professions
carve
their
own
lines
on

and
form
certain
circumstances
of

life
are
not
less
effective
as
personal
liberty
plenty
of
food
good
ale
and
mutton
open
market
or
good
wages
for
every
kind
of
labor
high
bribes
to
talent
and
skill
the

life
or
the
million
opportunities
and
outlets
for
expanding
and
misplaced
talent
readiness
of
combination
among
themselves
for
politics
or
for
business
strikes
and
sense
of
superiority
founded
on
habit
of
victory
in
labor
and
in
war
and
the
appetite
for
superiority
grows
by
feeding
it
is
easy
to
add
to
the
counteracting
forces
to
race
credence
is
a
main
element
t
is
said
that
the
views
of
nature
held
by
any
people
determine
all
their
institutions
whatever
influences
add
to
mental
or
moral
faculty
take
men
out
of
nationality
as
out
of
other
conditions
and
make
the
national
life
a
culpable
compromise
these
limitations
of
the
formidable
doctrine
of
race
suggest
others
which
threaten
to
undermine
it
as
not
sufficiently
based
the
fixity
or
inconvertibleness
of
races
as
we
see
them
is
a
weak
argument
for
the
eternity
of
these
frail
boundaries
since
all
our
historical
period
is
a
point
to
the
duration
in
which
nature
has
wrought
any
the
least
and
solitariest
fact
in
our
natural
history
such
as
the
melioration
of
fruits
and
of
animal
stocks
has
the
worth
of
a
in
the
opportunity
of
geologic
periods
moreover
though
we
flatter
the
of
men
and
nations
by
the
legend
of
pure
races
all
our
experience
is
of
the
gradation
and
resolution
of
races
and
strange
resemblances
meet
us
everywhere
it
need
not
puzzle
us
that
malay
and
papuan
celt
and
itonian
saxon
and
tartar
should
mix
when
we
see
the
rudiments
of
tiger
and
baboon
in
our
human
form
and
know
that
the
barriers
of
races
are
not
so
firm
but
that
some
spray
sprinkles
us
from
the
antediluvian
seas
the
low
organizations
are
simplest
a
mere
mouth
a
jelly
or
a
straight
worm
as
the
scale
mounts
the
organizations
become
complex
we
are
piqued
with
pure
descent
but
nature
loves
inoculation
a
child
blends
in
his
face
the
faces
of
both
parents
and
some
feature
from
every
ancestor
whose
face
hangs
on
the
wall
the
best
nations
are
those
most
widely
related
and
navigation
as
effecting
a
mixture
is
the
most
potent
advancer
of
nations
the
english
composite
character
betrays
a
mixed
origin
everything
english
is
a
fusion
of
distant
and
antagonistic
elements
the
language
is
mixed
the
names
of
men
are
of
different
nations
three
languages
three
or
four
nations
the
currents
of
thought
are
counter
contemplation
and
practical
skill
active
intellect
and
dead
conservatism
enterprise
and
devoted
use
and
wont
aggressive
freedom
and
hospitable
law
with
bitter
class
legislation
a
people
scattered
by
their
wars
and
affairs
over
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
and
homesick
to
a
man
a
country
of
extremes
dukes
and
chartists
bishops
of
durham
and
naked
heathen
colliers
nothing
can
be
praised
in
it
without
damning
exceptions
and
nothing
denounced
without
salvos
of
cordial
praise
neither
do
this
people
appear
to
be
of
one
stem
but
collectively
a
better
race
than
any
from
which
they
are
derived
nor
is
it
easy
to
trace
it
home
to
its
original
seats
who
can
call
by
right
names
what
races
are
in
britain
who
can
trace
them
historically
who
can
discriminate
them
anatomically
or
metaphysically
in
the
impossibility
of
arriving
at
satisfaction
on
the
historical
question
of
race
and
come
of
whatever
disputable
ancestry
the
indisputable
englishman
before
me
himself
very
well
marked
and
nowhere
else
to
be
found
i
fancied
i
could
leave
quite
aside
the
choice
of
a
tribe
as
his
lineal
progenitors
defoe
said
in
his
wrath
the
englishman
was
the
mud
of
all
races
i
incline
to
the
belief
that
as
water
lime
and
sand
make
mortar
so
certain
temperaments
marry
well
and
by
contrarieties
develop
as
drastic
a
character
as
the
english
on
the
whole
it
is
not
so
much
a
history
of
one
or
of
certain
tribes
of
saxons
jutes
or
frisians
coming
from
one
place
and
genetically
identical
as
it
is
an
anthology
of
temperaments
out
of
them
all
certain
temperaments
suit
the
sky
and
soil
of
england
say
eight
or
ten
or
twenty
varieties
as
out
of
a
hundred
eight
or
ten
suit
the
soil
of
an
orchard
and
thrive
whilst
all
the
unadapted
temperaments
die
out
the
english
derive
their
pedigree
from
such
a
range
of
nationalities
that
there
needs
and
to
unfold
the
varieties
of
talent
and
character
perhaps
the
ocean
serves
as
a
galvanic
battery
to
distribute
acids
at
one
pole
and
alkalies
at
the
other
so
england
tends
to
accumulate
her
liberals
in
america
and
her
conservatives
at
london
the
scandinavians
in
her
race
still
hear
in
every
age
the
murmurs
of
their
mother
the
ocean
the
briton
in
the
blood
hugs
the
homestead
still
again
as
if
to
intensate
the
influences
that
are
not
of
race
what
we
think
of
when
we
talk
of
english
traits
really
narrows
itself
to
a
small
district
it
excludes
ireland
and
scotland
and
wales
and
reduces
itself
at
last
to
london
that
is
to
those
who
come
and
go
thither
the
portraits
that
hang
on
the
walls
in
the
academy
exhibition
at
london
the
figures
in
punch
s

of
the
public
men
or
of
the
the

in
the
are
distinctive
english
and
not
american
no
nor
scotch
nor
irish
but
t
is
a
very
restricted
nationality
as
you
go
north
into
the
manufacturing
and
agricultural
districts
and
to
the
population
that
never
travels
as
you
go
into
yorkshire
as
you
enter
scotland
the
world
s
englishman
is
no
longer
found
in
scotland
there
is
a
rapid
loss
of
all
grandeur
of
mien
and
manners
a
provincial
eagerness
and
acuteness
appear
the
poverty
of
the
country
makes
itself
remarked
and
a
coarseness
of
manners
and
among
the
intellectual
is
the
insanity
of

these

concerning

may
be
well
allowed
for
there

no

that

more
to

only
a
hardy

have

in

that

the

the

it

for
us
to
speculate
in

his

they

no

of

the

have
forced
to

they
have
weapons
which
they
use
in

for

living
amphibiously

the

is
the
illusion

that
decent
and

now

boast
their

pictures
of
these

here
they
are

it

the

that
disadvantage

men
now
in
england
please
by
beauty
of
the
same
character
an
expression
blending
valor
and
refinement
and
mainly
by
that
uncorrupt
youth
in
the
face
of
manhood
which
is
daily
seen
in
the
streets
of
london
both
branches
of
the
scandinavian
race
are
distinguished
for
beauty
the
anecdote
of
the
handsome
captives
which
saint
gregory
found
at
rome
is
matched
by
the
testimony
of
the
norman
chroniclers
five
centuries
later
who
wondered
at
the
beauty
and
long
flowing
hair
of
the
young
english
captives
meantime
the
heimskringla
has
frequent
occasion
to
speak
of
the
personal
beauty
of
its
heroes
when
it
is
considered
what
humanity
what
resources
of
mental
and
moral
power
the
traits
of
the
blond
race
betoken
its
accession
to
empire
marks
a
new
and
finer
epoch
wherein
the
old
mineral
force
shall
be
subjugated
at
last
by
humanity
and
shall
plough
in
its
furrow
henceforward
it
is
not
a
final
race
once
a
crab
always
crab
but
a
race
with
a
future
on
the
english
face
are
combined
decision
and
nerve
with
the
fair
complexion
blue
eyes
and
open
and
florid
aspect
hence
the
love
of
truth
hence
the
sensibility
the
fine
perception
and
poetic
construction
the
fair
saxon
man
with
open
front
and
honest
meaning
domestic
affectionate
is
not
the
wood
out
of
which
cannibal
or
inquisitor
or
assassin
is
made
but
he
is
moulded
for
law
lawful
trade
civility
marriage
the
nurture
of
children
for
colleges
churches
charities
and
colonies
they
are
rather
manly
than
warlike
when
the
war
is
over
the
mask
falls
from
the
affectionate
and
domestic
tastes
which
make
them
women
in
kindness
this
union
of
qualities

the
english
delight
in
the
antagonism
which
combines
in

person
the
extremes
of
courage
and
tenderness

clarendon
says
the
duke
of
buckingham
was
so
modest
and
gentle
that
some
courtiers
attempted
to
put
affronts
on
him
until
they
found
that
this
modesty
and
effeminacy
was
only
a
mask
for
the
most
terrible
determination

sir

said
of
sir
john
franklin
that

he

as

hunting
is
the
fine

they
are

with

all
the

hawker

a

the
people

addicted

matches
i
suppose
the
dogs
and
horses
must
be
thanked
for
the
fact
that
the
men
have
muscles
almost
as
tough
and
supple
as
their
own
if
in
every
efficient
man
there
is
first
a
fine
animal
in
the
english
race
it
is
of
the
best
breed
a
wealthy
juicy
creature
steeped
in
ale
and
good
cheer
and
a
little
overloaded
by
his
flesh
men
of
animal
nature
rely
like
animals
on
their
instincts
the
englishman
associates
well
with
dogs
and
horses
his
attachment
to
the
horse
arises
from
the
courage
and
address
required
to
manage
it
the
horse
finds
out
who
is
afraid
of
it
and
does
not
disguise
its
opinion
their
young
boiling
clerks
and
lusty
collegians
like
the
company
of
horses
better
than
the
company
of
professors
i
suppose
the
horses
are
better
company
for
them
the
horse
has
more
uses
than
buffon
noted
if
you
go
into
the
streets
every
driver
in
bus
or
dray
is
a
bully
and
if
i
wanted
a
good
troop
of
soldiers
i
should
recruit
among
the
stables
add
a
certain
degree
of
refinement
to
the
vivacity
of
these
riders
and
you
obtain
the
precise
quality
which
makes
the
men
and
women
of
polite
society
formidable
they
come
honestly
by
their
horsemanship
with
and
for
their
saxon
founders
the
other
branch
of
their
race
had
been
tartar
nomads
the
horse
was
all
their
wealth
the
children
were
fed
on
mares
milk
the
pastures
of
tartary
were
still
remembered
by
the
tenacious
practice
of
the
norsemen
to
eat
at
religious
feasts
in
the
danish
invasions
the
marauders
seized
upon
horses
where
they
landed
and
were
at
once
converted
into
a
body
of
expert
cavalry
at
one
time
this
skill
seems
to
have
declined
two
centuries
ago
the
english
horse
never
performed
any
eminent
service
beyond
the
seas
and
the
reason
assigned
was
that
the
genius
of
the
english
hath
always
more
inclined
them
to
as
pure
and
proper
manhood
without
any
mixture
whilst
in
a
victory
on
horseback
the
credit
ought
to
be
divided
betwixt
the
man
and
his
horse
but
in
two
hundred
years
a
change
has
taken
place
now
they
boast
that
they
understand
horses
better
than
any
other
people
in
the
world
and
that
their
horses
are
become
their
second
selves
william
the
conqueror

says
camden
better
affected
to
beasts
than
to
men
imposed
heavy
fines
and
punishments
on
those

should
meddle
with
his
game
the
saxon
chronicle
says
he
loved
the
tall
deer
as
if
he
were

followed

a
proverb
in

that
it

the
severity
of
the
certainly
indicates
an
extravagant
sympathy
of
the
nation
with
horses
and
hunters
the
gentlemen
are
always
on

history
does
not
allow
us
to
fix
the
limits
of
the
application
of
these
names
with
any
accuracy
but
from
the
residence
of
a
portion
of
these
people
in
france
and
from
some
effect
of
that
powerful
soil
on
their
blood
and
manners
the
norman
has
come
popularly
to
represent
in
england
the
aristocratic
and
the
saxon
the
democratic
principle
and
though
i
doubt
not
the
nobles
are
of
both
tribes
and
the
workers
of
both
yet
we
are
forced
to
use
the
names
a
little
mythically
one
to
represent
the
worker
and
the
other
the
enjoyer
the
island
was
a
prize
for
the
best
race
each
of
the
dominant
races
tried
its
fortune
in

in
the
very
day
when
his
fortune
culminated
he
looked
in
the
eyes
of
a
new
people
that
was
to
supplant
his
own
he
disembarked
his
legions
erected
his
camps
and
towers
presently
he
heard
bad
news
from
italy
and
worse
and
worse
every
year
at
last
he
made
a
handsome
compliment
of
roads
and
walls
and
departed

the

managed
to
make

this
effect
the
island
is
lucrative
to
free
labor
but
not
worth
possession
on

terms
the
race
was
so
intellectual
that
a
feudal
or

tenure
could
not
last
longer
than
the

power
of

thoroughly

sir
kenelm
wrote
a
book
of
bodies
and
of
souls
in
which
he
propounds
that
syllogisms
do
breed
or
rather
are
all
the
variety
of
man
s
life
they
are
the
steps
by
which
we
walk
in
all
our
businesses
man
as
he
is
man
doth
nothing
else
but
weave
such
chains
whatsoever
he
doth
swarving
from
this
work
lie
doth
as
deficient
from
the
nature
of
man
and
if
he
do
aught
beyond
this
by
breaking
out
into
divers
sorts
of
exterior
actions
he
findeth
nevertheless
in
this
linked
sequel
of
simple
discourses
the
art
the
cause
the
rule
the
bounds
and
the
model
of
it
antony
wood
man
s
soule
there
spoke
the
genius
of
the
english
people
there
is
a
necessity
on
them
to
be
logical
they
would
hardly
greet
the
good
that
did
not
logically
fall
as
if
it
excluded
their
own
merit
or
shook
their
understandings
they
are
jealous
of
minds
that
have
much
facility
of
association
from
an
instinctive
fear
that
the
seeing
many
relations
to
their
thought
might
impair
this
serial
continuity
and
lucrative
concentration
they
are
impatient
of
genius
or
of
minds
addicted
to
contemplation
and
can
not
conceal
their
contempt
for
sallies
of
thought
however
lawful
whose
steps
they
can
not
count
by
their
wonted
rule
neither
do
they
reckon
better
a
syllogism
that
ends
in
syllogism
for
they
have
a
supreme
eye
to
facts
and
theirs
is
a
logic
that
brings
salt
to
soup
hammer
to
nail
oar
to
boat
the
logic
of
cooks
carpenters
and
chemists
following
the
sequence
of
nature
and
one
on
which
words
make
no
impression
their
mind
is
not
dazzled
by
its
own
means
but
locked
and
bolted
to
results
they
love
men
who
like
samuel
johnson
a
doctor
in
the
schools
would
jump
out
of
his
syllogism
the
instant
his
major
proposition
was
in
danger
to
save
that
at
all
hazards
their
practical
vision
is
spacious
and
they
can
hold
many
threads
without
entangling
them
all
the
steps
they
orderly
take
but
with
the
high
logic
of
never
confounding
the
minor
and
major
proposition
keeping
their
eye
on
their
aim
in
all
the
complicity
and
delay
incident
to
the
several
series
of
means
they
employ
there
is
room
in
their
minds
for
this
and
that
a
science
of
degrees
in
the
courts
the
independence
of
the
judges
and
the
loyalty
of
the
suitors
are
equally
excellent
in
parliament
they
have
hit
on
that
capital
invention
of
freedom
a
constitutional
opposition
and
when
courts
and
parliament
are
both
deaf
the
plaintiff
is
not
silenced
calm
patient
his
weapon
of
defence
from
year
to
year
is
the
obstinate
reproduction
of
the
grievance
with
calculations
and
estimates
but
meantime
he
is
drawing
numbers
and
money
to
his
opinion
resolved
that
if
all
remedy
fails
right
of
revolution
is
at
the
bottom
of
his
they
are
bound
to
see
their
measure
carried
and
stick
to
it
through
ages
of
defeat
into
this
english
logic
however
an
infusion
of
justice
enters
not
so
apparent
in
other
races
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
two
sides
and
the
resolution
to
see
fair
play
there
is
on
every
question
an
appeal
from
the
assertion
of
the
parties
to
the
proof
of
what
is
asserted
they
are
impious
in
their
scepticism
of
a
theory
but
kiss
the
dust
before
a
fact
is
it
a
machine
is
it
a
charter
is
it
a
boxer
in
the
ring
is
it
a
candidate
on
the
hustings
the
universe
of
englishmen
will
suspend
their
judgment
until
the
trial
can
be
had
they
are
not
to
be
led
by
a
phrase
they
want
a
working
plan
a
working
machine
a
working
constitution
and
will
sit
out
the
trial
and
abide
by
the
issue
and
reject
all
preconceived
theories
in
politics
they
put
blunt
questions
which
must
be
answered
who
is
to
pay
the
taxes
what
will
you
do
for
trade
what
for
corn
what
for
the
spinner
this
singular
fairness
and
its
results
strike
the
french
with
surprise
philip
de
commines
says
now
in
my
opinion
among
all
the
sovereignties
i
know
in
the
world
that
in
which
the
public
good
is
best
attended
to
and
the
least
violence
exercised
on
the
people
is
that
of
england
life
is
safe
and
personal
rights
and
what
is
freedom
without
security
whilst
in
france
fraternity
equality
and
indivisible
unity
are
names
for
assassination
montesquieu
said
england
is
the
freest
country
in
the
world
if
a
man
in
england
had
as
many
enemies
as
hairs
on
his
head
no
harm
would
happen
to
him
their
their
faith
in
causation
and
their
realistic
logic
or
coupling
of
means
to
ends
have
given
them
the
leadership
of
the
modern
world
montesquieu
said
no
people
have
true
but
those
who
are
born
in
england
this
is
a
perception
of
all
the
conditions
of
our
earthly
existence
of
laws
that
can
be
stated
and
of
laws
that
can
not
be
stated
or
that
are
learned
only
by
practice
in
which
allowance
for
friction
is
made
they
are
impious
in
their
scepticism
of
theory
and
in
high
departments
they
are
cramped
and
sterile
but
the
unconditional
surrender
to
facts
and
the
choice
of
means
to
reach
their
ends
are
as
admirable
as
with
ants
and
bees
the
bias
of
the
nation
is
a
passion
for
utility
they
love
the
lever
the
screw
and
pulley
the
flanders
the
waterfall
the
sea
and
the
wind
to
bear
their
more
than
the
diamond
which
glitters
among
their
they
prize
that
dull
pebble
which
is
wiser
than
a
man
whose
poles
turn
themselves
to
the
poles
of
the
world
and
whose
axis
is
parallel
to
the
axis
of
the
world
now
their
toys
are
steam
and
galvanism
they
are
heavy
at
the
fine
arts
but
adroit
at
the
coarse
not
good
in
jewelry
or
mosaics
but
the
best
colliers
and
tanners
in
europe
they
apply
themselves
to
agriculture
to
draining
to
resisting

to

steady
combinations

of
his

they
are
neat

for
ordering
all
their

pertaining
to

all
are
well
kept
there
is
no

and
no

they
study

in
their
building
in
the
order
of
their
dwellings
and
in
their
dress
the
frenchman
invented
the

the

the
englishman

a
sensible
coat
buttoned
to
the
chin
of
rough
but
solid
and
lasting
texture
if
he
is
a
lord
he
dresses
a
little
worse
than
a
commoner
they
have
diffused
the
taste
for
plain
substantial
hats
shoes
and
coats
through
europe
they
think
him
the
best
dressed
man
whose
dress
is
so
fit
for
his
use
that
you
can
not
notice
or
remember
to
describe
it
they
secure
the
essentials
in
their
diet
in
their
arts
and
manufactures
every
article
of
cutlery
shows
in
its
shape
thought
and
long
experience
of
workmen
they
put
the
expense
in
the
right
place
as
in
their
in
the
solidity
of
the
machinery
and
the
strength
of
the

admirable
equipment
of
their
arctic
ships

london

they
build
roads
aqueducts
warm
and
ventilate
houses
and
they
have
impressed
their
directness
and
practical
habit
on
modern
civilization
in
trade
the
englishman
believes
that
nobody
breaks
who
ought
not
to
break
and
that
if
he
do
not
make
trade
everything
it
will
make
him
nothing
and
acts
on
this
belief
the
spirit
of
system
attention
to
details
and
the
subordination
of
details
or
the
not
driving
things
too
finely
which
is
charged
on
the
germans
constitute
that
despatch
of
business
which
makes
the
mercantile
power
of
england
in
war
the
englishman
looks
to
his
means
he
is
of
the
opinion
of
civilis
his
german
ancestor
whom
tacitus
reports
as
holding
that
the
gods
are
on
the
side
of
the
strongest
a
sentence
which
bonaparte
unconsciously
translated
when
he
said
that
he
had
noticed
that
providence
always
favored
the
heaviest
battalion
their
military
science
propounds
that
if
the
weight
of
the
advancing
column
is
greater
than
that
of
the
resisting
the
latter
is
destroyed
therefore
wellington
when
he
came
to
the
army
in
spain
had
every
man
weighed
first
with
accoutrements
and
then
without
believing
that
the
force
of
an
army
depended
on
the
weight
and
power
of
the
individual
soldiers
in
spite
of
cannon
lord
palmerston
told
the
house
of
commons
that
more
care
is
taken
of
the
health
and
comfort
of
english
troops
than
of
any
other
troops
in
the
world
and
that
hence
the
english
can
put
more
men
into
the
ranks
on
the
day
of
action
on
the
field
of
battle
than
any
other

and

the
outer
quarter
of
each
of
the
enemy
s
were
only
translations
into
naval
tactics
of
bonaparte
s
rule
of
concentration
lord
collingwood
was
accustomed
to
tell
his
men
that
if
they
could
fire
three
broadsides
in
five
minutes
no
vessel
could
resist
them
and
from
constant
practice
they
came
to
do
it
in
three
minutes
and
a
half
but
conscious
that
no
race
of
better
men
exists
they
rely
most
on
the
simplest
means
and
do
not
like
ponderous
and
difficult
tactics
but
delight
to
bring
the
affair
hand
to
hand
where
the
victory
lies
with
the
strength
courage
and
endurance
of
the
individual
combatants
they
adopt
every
improvement
in
rig
in
motor
in
weapons
but
they
fundamentally
believe
that
the
best
stratagem
in
naval
war
is
to
lay
your
ship
close
alongside
of
the
enemy
s
ship
and
bring
all
your
guns
to
bear
on
him
until
you
or
he
go
to
the
bottom
this
is
the
old
fashion
which
never
goes
out
of
fashion
neither
in
nor
out
of
england
it
is
not
usually
a
point
of
honor
nor
a
religious
sentiment
and
never
any
whim
that
they
will
shed
their
blood
for
but
usually
property
and
right
measured
by
property
that
breeds
revolution
they
have
no
indian
taste
for
a
no
french
taste
for
a
badge
or
a
proclamation
the
englishman
is
peaceably
minding
his
business
and
earning
his
day
s
wages
but
if
you
offer
to
lay
hand
on
his
day
s
wages
on
his
cow
or
his
right
in
common
or
his
shop
he
will
fight
to
the
judgment
popery
plymouth
colony
american
revolution
are
all
questions
involving
a
yeoman
s
right
to
his
dinner
and
except
as
touching
that
would
not
have
lashed
the
british
nation
to
rage
and
revolt
whilst
they
are
thus
instinct
with
a
spirit
of
order
and
of
calculation
it
must
be
owned
they
are
capable
of
larger
views
but
the
indulgence
is
expensive
to
them
costs
great
crises
or
accumulations
of
mental
power
in
common
the
horse
works
best
with

nothing
is
more
in
the

pray
sir
how
do
you
get
your
living
when

the

questions
heavy

flagellated
by

by
the

of

of
burning
towns
tacitus
says
of
the
germans
powerful
only
in
sudden
efforts
they
are
impatient
of
toil

labor
this
highly
destined
race
if
it

not
somewhere
added
the

london
i

not
from
which
of
the
tribes
and
temperaments
that
went
to
the
composition
of
the
people
this
tenacity
was
supplied
but
they
clinch
every
nail
they
drive
they
have
no
running
for
luck
and
no
immoderate
speed
they
spend
largely
on
their
fabric
and
await
the
slow
return
their
leather
lies
tanning
seven
years
in
the
vat
at
rogers
s
mills
in
sheffield
where
i
was
shown
the
process
of
making
a
razor
and
a
penknife
i
was
told
there
is
no
luck
in
making
good
steel
that
they
make
no
mistakes
every
blade
in
the
hundred
and
in
the
thousand
is
good
and
that
is
characteristic
of
all
their
work
no
more
is
attempted
than
is
done
when
thor
and
his
companions
arrive
at
utgard
he
is
told
that
nobody
is
permitted
to
remain
here
unless
he
understand
some
art
and
excel
in
it
all
other
men
the
same
question
is
still
put
to
the
posterity
of
thor
a
nation
of
laborers
every
man
is
trained
to
some
one
art
or
detail
and
aims
at
perfection
in
that
not
content
unless
he
has
something
in
which
he
thinks
he
surpasses
all
other
men
he
would
rather
not
do
anything
at
all
than
not
do
it
well
i
suppose
no
people
have
such
thoroughness
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
every
man
meaning
to
be
master
of
his
art
to

a

in

in

were
the
excavation
and

by
sir
charles
fellowes
for
the
xanthian
monument
and
of

for
his

the
nation
sits
in
the
immense
city
they
have
builded
a
london
extended
into
every
man

mind
though
he
live
in
van
dieman

or
capetown
faithful
performance
of
what
is
undertaken
to
be
performed
they
honor
in
themselves
and
exact
in
others
as
certificate
of
equality
with
themselves
the
modern
world
is
theirs
they
have
made
and
make
it
day
by
day
the
commercial
relations
of
the
world
are
so
intimately
drawn
to
london
that
every
dollar
on
earth
contributes
to
the
strength
of
the
english
government
and
if
all
the
wealth
in
the
planet
should
perish
by
war
or
deluge
they
know
themselves
competent
to
replace
it
they
have
approved
their
saxon
blood
by
their
qualities
their
descent
from
odin
s
smiths
by
their
hereditary
skill
in
working
in
iron
their
british
birth
by
husbandry
and
immense
wheat
harvests
and
justified
their
occupancy
of
the
centre
of
habitable
land
by
their
supreme
ability
and
cosmopolitan
spirit
they
have
tilled
builded
forged
spun
and
woven
they
have
made
the
island
a
thoroughfare
and
london
a
shop
a
a
and
scientific
bureau
inviting
to
strangers
a
sanctuary
to
refugees
of
every
political
and
religious
opinion
and
such
a
city
that
almost
every
active
man
in
any
nation
finds
himself
at
one
time
or
other
forced
to
visit
it
in
every
path
of
practical
activity
they
have
gone
even
with
the
best
there
is
no
secret
of
war
in
which
they
have
not
shown
mastery
the
of
watt
the
locomotive
of
stephenson
the
of
roberts
perform
the
labor
of
the
world
there
is
no
department
of
literature
of
science
or
of
useful
art
in
which
they
have
not
produced
a
book
it
is
england
whose
opinion
is
waited
for
on
the
merit
of
a
new
invention
an
improved
science
and
in
the
complications
of
the
trade
and
politics
of
their
vast
empire
they
have
been
equal
to
every
exigency
with
counsel
and
with
conduct
is
it
their
luck
or
is
it
in
the
chambers
of
their
brain
it
is
their
commercial
advantage
that
whatever
light
appears
in
better
method
or
happy
invention
breaks
out
their
they
are
a
family
to
which
a
destiny
attaches
and
the
banshee
has
sworn
that
a
male
heir
shall
never
be
wanting
they
have
a
wealth
of
men
to
fill
important
posts
and
the
vigilance
of
party
criticism
insures
the
selection
of
a
competent
person
a
proof
of
the
energy
of
the
british
people
is
the
highly
artificial
construction
of
the
whole
fabric
the
climate
and
geography
i
said
were
factitious
as
if
the
hands
of
man
had
arranged
the
conditions
the
same
character
pervades
the
whole
kingdom
bacon
said
rome
was
a
state
not
subject
to
paradoxes
but
england
subsists
by
antagonisms
and
contradictions
the
foundations
of
its
greatness
are
the
rolling
waves
and
from
first
to
last
it
is
a
museum
of
anomalies
this
foggy
and
rainy
country
furnishes
the
world
with
astronomical
observations
its
short
rivers
do
not
afford
but
the
land
shakes
under
the
thunder
of
the
mills
there
is
no
of
any
importance
but
there
is
more
gold
in
england
than
in
all
other
countries
it
is
too
far
north
for
the
culture
of
the
vine
but
the
wines
of
all
countries
are
in
its
docks
the
french
comte
de
lauraguais
said
no
fruit
ripens
in
england
but
a
baked
apple
but
oranges
and
pineapples
are
as
cheap
in
london
as
in
the
mediterranean
the
express
or
the
returns
bear
out
to
the
letter
the
vaunt
of
pope
let
india
boast
her
palms
nor
envy
we
the
weeping
amber
nor
the
spicy
tree
while
by
our
oaks
those
precious
loads
are
borne
and
realms
commanded
which
those
trees
adorn
the
native
cattle
are
extinct
but
the
island
is
full
of
artificial
breeds
the
agriculturist
bakewell
created
sheep
and
cows
and
horses
to
order
and
breeds
in
which
everything
was
omitted
but
what
is
economical
the
cow
is
sacrificed
to
her
bag
the
ox
to
his
surloin
makes
of
the
cattle
and
converts
the
stable
to
a
chemical
factory
the
rivers
lakes
and
ponds
too
much
fished
or
obstructed
by
factories
are
artificially
filled
with
the
eggs
of
salmon
turbot
and
herring
chat
moss
and
the
fens
of
lincolnshire
and
cambridgeshire
are
unhealthy
and
too
barren
to
pay
rent
by
cylindrical
tiles
and
tubes
five
millions
of
acres
of
bad
land
have
been
drained
and
put
on
equality
with
the
best
for
and
grass
the
climate
too
which
was
already
believed
to
have
become
milder
and
drier
by
the
enormous
consumption
of
coal
is
so
far
reached
by
this
new
action
that
fogs
and
storms
are
said
to
disappear
in
due
course
all
england
will
be
drained
and
rise
a
second
time
out
of
the
waters
the
latest
step
was
to
call
in
the
aid
of
steam
to
agriculture
steam
is
almost
an
englishman
i
do
not
know
but
they
will
send
him
to
parliament
next
to
make
laws
he
weaves
forges
saws
pounds
fans
and
now
he
must
pump
grind
dig
and
plough
for
the
farmer
the
markets
created
by
the
manufacturing
population
have
erected
agriculture
into
a
great
thriving
and
spending
industry
the
value
of
the
houses
in
britain
is
equal
to
the
value
of
the
soil
artificial
aids
of
all
kinds
are
cheaper
than
the
natural
resources
no
man
can
afford
to
walk
when
the
parliamentary
train
carries
him
for
a
penny
a
mile
are
cheaper
than
daylight
in
numberless
floors
in
the
cities
all
the
houses
in
london
buy
their
water
the
english
trade
does
not
exist
for
the
exportation
of
native
products
but
on
its
manufactures
or
the
making
well
everything
which
is
ill
made
elsewhere
they
make
ponchos
for
the
mexican
bandannas
for
the
hindoo
ginseng
for
the
chinese
beads
for
the
indian
laces
for
the
flemings
telescopes
for
astronomers
cannons
for
kings
the
board
of
trade
caused
the
best
models
of
greece
and
italy
to
be
placed
within
the
reach
of
every
manufacturing
population
they
caused
to
be
translated
from
foreign
languages
and
illustrated
by
elaborate
drawings
the
most
approved
works
of
munich
berlin
and
paris
they
have
ransacked
italy
to
find
new
forms
to
add
a
grace
to
the
products
of
their
looms
their
potteries
and
their
see
memorial
of
greenough
new
york
the
nearer
we
look
the
more
artificial
is
their
social
system
their
law
is
a
network
of
fictions
their
property
a
scrip
or
certificate
of
right
to
interest
on
money
that
no
man
ever
saw
their
social
classes
are
made
by
statute
their
ratios
of
power
and
representation
are
historical
and
legal
the
last
took
away
political
power
from
a
mound
a
ruin
and
a
whilst
birmingham
and
manchester
whose
mills
paid
for
the
wars
of
europe
had
no
representative
purity
in
the

kept
by

colonies
power
at

by
a
standing
army
of
police
the
pauper
lives
better
than
the
free
laborer
the
thief
better
than
the
pauper
and
the
transported
felon
better
than
the
one
under
imprisonment
the
crimes
are
factitious
as
smuggling
poaching
heresy
and
treason
better
they
say
in
england
kill
a
man
than
a
hare
the
sovereignty
of

the

said
lord

solvency
is
maintained
by

if
you
will
not

can
i
pay

sir
samuel
romilly
s
expedient
for
clearing
the
arrears
of
business
in
chancery
was
the
chancellor
s
staying
away
entirely
from
his
court
their
system
of
education
is
factitious
the
universities
galvanize
dead
languages
into
a
semblance
of
life
their
church
is
artificial
the
manners
and
customs
of
society
are
artificial
men
with
manners
and
thus
the
whole
is
birminghamized
and
we
have
a
nation
whose
existence
is
a
work
of
art
a
cold
barren
almost
arctic
isle
being
made
the
most
fruitful
luxurious
and
imperial
land
in
the
whole
earth
sir
romilly
purest
of
english
patriots
decided
that
the
only
independent
mode
of
entering
parliament
was
to
buy
a
seat
and
he
bought
horsham
man
in
england
submits
to
be
a
product
of
political
economy
on
a
bleak
moor
a
mill
is
built
a
is
opened
and
men
come
in
as
water
in
a
and
towns
and
cities
rise
man
is
made
as
a
birmingham
button
the
rapid
doubling
of
the

dates
from

landlord
who
owns
a
province
says
the
tenantry
are
unprofitable
let
me
have
sheep
he
unroofs
the
houses
and
ships
the
population
to
america
the
nation
is
accustomed
to
the
instantaneous
creation
of
wealth
it
is
the
maxim
of
their
economists
that
the
greater
part
in
value
of
the
wealth
now
existing
in
england
has
been
produced
by
human
hands
within
the
last
twelve
months
meantime
three
or
four
days
rain
will
reduce
hundreds
to
starving
in
london
one
secret
of
their
power
is
their
mutual
good
understanding
not
only
good
minds
are
born
among
them
but
all
the
people
have
good
minds
every
nation
has
yielded
some
good
wit
if
as
has
chanced
to
many
tribes
only
one
but
the
intellectual
organization
of
the
english
admits
a
communicableness
of
knowledge
and
ideas
among
them
all
an
electric
touch
by
any
of
their
national
ideas
melts
them
into
one
family
and
brings
the
hoards
of
power
which
their
individuality
is
always
hiving
into
use
and
play
for
all
is
it
the
smallness
of
the
country
or
is
it
the
pride
and
affection
of
race
they
have
solidarity
or
responsibleness
and
trust
in
each
other
their
minds
like
wool
admit
of
a
dye
which
is
more
lasting
than
the
cloth
they
embrace
their
cause
with
more
tenacity
than
their
life
though
not
military
yet
every
common
subject
by
the
poll
is
fit
to
make
a
soldier
of
these
private
reserved
mute
can
adopt
a
public
end
with
all
their
heat
and
this
strength
of
affection
makes
the
romance
of
their
heroes
the
difference
of
rank
does
not
divide
the
national
heart
the
danish
poet
oehlenschlager
complains
that
who
writes
in
danish
writes
to
two
hundred
readers
in
germany
there
is
one
speech
for
the
learned
and
another
for
the
masses
to
that
extent
that
it
is
said
no
sentiment
or
phrase
from
the
works
of
any
great
german
writer
is
ever
heard
among
the
lower
classes
but
in
england
the
language
of
the
noble
is
the
language
of
the
poor
in
parliament
in
pulpits
in
theatres
when
the
speakers
rise
to
thought
and
passion
the
language
becomes
idiomatic
the
people
in
the
street
best
understand
the
best
words
and
their
language
seems
drawn
from
the
bible
the
common
law
and
the
works
of
shakspeare
bacon
milton
pope
young
cowper
burns
and
scott
the
island
has
produced
two
or
three
of
the
greatest
men
that
ever
existed
but
they
were
not
solitary
in
their
own
time
men
quickly
embodied
what
newton
found
out
in
greenwich
observatories
and
practical
navigation
the
boys
knew
all
that
hutton
knew
of
strata
or
dalton
of
atoms
or
harvey
of
and
these
studies
once
dangerous
are
in
fashion
so
what
is
invented
or
known
in
agriculture
or
in
trade
or
in
war
or
in
art
or
in
literature
and
antiquities
a
great
ability
not
amassed
on
a
few
giants
but
poured
into
the
general
mind
so
that
each
of
them
could
at
a
pinch
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
other
and
they
are
more
bound
in
character
than
differenced
in
ability
or
in
rank
the
laborer
is
a
possible
lord
the
lord
is
a
possible
every
man
carries
the
english
system
in
his
brain
knows
what
is
confided
to
him
and
does
therein
the
best
he
can

the

felons

their
pride
in

s
english
stanchness
in
politics
and
in

they
hold
together
as
by
hooks
of

the
charm

whilst
they
are
some
ages
ahead

whilst
in
some
directions
they
do
not
represent
the
modern

but
constitute
it

vanguard
of
civility

they
coldly
hold
marching
in
phalanx
foot

ten

deep
chapter
manners
i
find
the
englishman
to
be
him
of
all
men
who
stands
firmest
in
his
shoes
they
have
in
themselves
what
they
value
in
their
horses
mettle
and
bottom
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
at
liverpool
a
gentleman
in
describing
to
me
the
lord
lieutenant
of
ireland
happened
to
say
lord
clarendon
has
pluck
like
a
cock
and
will
fight
till
he
dies
and
what
i
heard
first
i
heard
last
and
the
one
thing
the
english
value
is
the
word
is
not
beautiful
but
on
the
quality
they
signify
by
it
the
nation
is
unanimous
the
cabmen
have
it
the
merchants
have
it
the
bishops
have
it
the
women
have
it
the
journals
have
it
the
times
newspaper
they
say
is
the
pluckiest
thing
in
england
and
sidney
smith
had
made
it
a
proverb
that
little
lord
john

would
take

command
of

fleet
they
require
you
to
dare
to
be
of
your
own

and
they
hate
the
practical
cowards
who
can
not
in
affairs
answer
directly
yes
or
no
they
dare
to
displease
nay
they
will
let
you
break
all
the
commandments
if
you
do
it
natively
and
with
spirit
you
must
be
somebody
then
you
may
do
this
or
that
as
you
will
machinery
has
been
applied
to
all
work
and
carried
to
such
perfection
that
little
is
left
for
the
men
but
to
mind
the
engines
and
feed
the
furnaces
but
the
machines
require
punctual
service
and
as
they
never
tire
they
prove
too
much
for
their
tenders
mines
forges
mills
breweries

drill
of

of

and
have
operated
to
give

regularity
to

of

a
terrible
machine
has
possessed
itself
of
the
ground
the
air
the
men

and
hardly
even

is
free
the
mechanical
might
and
organization
require
in
the
people
constitution

and
he
who
goes

must
have
some
weight

at

you
take
your
hint
from
the
fury
of

you
find
and
say
one
thing
is
plain
this
is
no
country
for
people
don
t
creep
about
diffidently
make
up
your
mind
take
your
own
course
and
you
shall
find
respect
and
furtherance
it
requires
men
say
a
good
constitution
to
travel
in
spain
i
say
as
much
of
england
for
other
cause
simply
on
account
of
the
vigor

of
the
people
nothing

the

serious
business
could
give

any
counterweight

though
they
were

the
englishman
speaks
with
all
his
body
his
elocution
is
stomachic
as
the
american
s
is
labial
the
englishman
is
very
petulant
and
precise
about
his
accommodation
at
inns
and
on
the
roads
a
quiddle
about
his
toast
and
his
chop
and
every
species
of
convenience
and
loud
and
pungent
in
his
expressions
of
impatience
at
any
neglect
his
vivacity
betrays
itself
at
all
points
in
his
manners
in
his
respiration
and
the
inarticulate
noises
he
makes
in
clearing
the
throat
all
significant
of
burly
strength
he
has
stamina
he
can
take
the
initiative
in
emergencies
he
has
that
which
results
from
a
good
adjustment
of
the
moral
and
physical
nature
and
the
obedience
of
all
the
powers
to
the
will
as
if
the
axes
of
his
eyes
were
united
to
his
backbone
and
only
moved
with
the
trunk
this
vigor
appears
in
the
incuriosity
and
stony
neglect
each
of
every
other
each
man
walks
eats
drinks
shaves
dresses
gesticulates
and
in
every
manner
acts
and
suffers
without
reference
to
the
bystanders
in
his
own
fashion
only
careful
not
to
interfere
with
them
or
annoy
them
not
that
he
is
trained
to
neglect
the
eyes
of
his
neighbors
he
is
really
occupied
with
his
own
affair
and
does
not
think
of
them
every
man
in
this
polished
country
consults
only
his
convenience
as
much
as
a
solitary
pioneer
in
wisconsin
i
know
not
where
any
personal
eccentricity
is
so
freely
allowed
and
no
man
gives
himself
any
concern
with
it
an
englishman
walks
in
a
pouring
rain
swinging
his
closed
umbrella
like
a
wears
a
wig
or
a
shawl
or
a
saddle
or
stands
on
his
head
and
no
remark
is
made
and
as
he
has
been
doing
this
for
several
generations
it
is
now
in
the
blood
in
short
every
one
of
these
islanders
is
an
island
himself
safe
tranquil
incommunicable
in
a
company
of
strangers
you
would
think
him
deaf
his
eyes
never
wander
from
his
table
and
newspaper
he
is
never
betrayed
into
any
curiosity
or
unbecoming
emotion
they
have
all
been
trained
in
one
severe
school
of
manners
and
never
put
off
the
harness
he
does
not
give
his
hand
he
does
not
let
you
meet
his
eye
it
is
almost
an
affront
to
look
a
man
in
the
face
without
being
introduced
in
mixed
or
in
select
companies
they
do
not
introduce
persons
so
that
a
presentation
is
a
circumstance
as
valid
as
a
contract
introductions
are
sacraments
he
withholds
his
name
at
the
hotel
he
is
hardly
willing
to
whisper
it
to
the
clerk
at
the
if
he
give
you
his
private
address
on
a
card
it
is
like
an
avowal
of
friendship
and
his
bearing
on
being
introduced
is
cold
even
though
he
is
seeking
your
acquaintance
and
is
studying
how
he
shall
serve
you
it
was
an
odd
proof
of
this
impressive
energy
that
in
my
lectures
i
hesitated
to
read
and
threw
out
for
its
impertinence
many
a
disparaging
phrase
which
i
had
been
accustomed
to
spin
about
poor
thin
unable
mortals
so
much
had
the
fine
physique
and
the
personal
vigor
of
this
robust
race
worked
on
my
imagination
i
happened
to
arrive
in
england
at
the
moment
of
a
commercial
crisis
but
it
was
evident
that
let
who
will
fail
england
will
not
these
people
have
sat
here
a
thousand
years
and
here
will
continue
to
sit
they
will
not
break
up
or
arrive
at
any
desperate
revolution
like
their
neighbors
for
they
have
as
much
energy
as
much
continence
of
character
as
they
ever
had
the
power
and
possession
which
surround
them
are
their
own
creation
and
they
exert
the
same
commanding
industry
at
this
moment
they
are
positive
methodical
cleanly
and
formal
loving
routine
and
conventional
ways
loving
truth
and
religion
to
be
sure
but
inexorable
on
points
of
form
all
the
world
praises
the
comfort
and
private
appointments
of
an
english
inn
and
of
english
households
you
are
sure
of
neatness
and
of
personal
decorum
a
frenchman
may
possibly
be
clean
an
englishman
is
conscientiously
clean
a
certain
order
and
complete
propriety
is
found
in
his
dress
and
in
his
belongings
born
in
a
harsh
and
wet
climate
which
keeps
him
in
doors
whenever
he
is
at
rest
and
being
of
an
affectionate
and
loyal
temper
he
dearly
loves
his
house
if
he
is
rich
he
buys
a
demesne
and
builds
a
hall
if
he
is
in
middle
condition
he
spares
no
expense
on
his
house
without
it
is
all
planted
within
it
is
wainscoted
carved
curtained
hung
with
pictures
and
filled
with
good
furniture
t
is
a
passion
which
survives
all
others
to
deck
and
improve
it
hither
he
brings
all
that
is
rare
and
costly
and
with
the
national
tendency
to
sit
fast
in
the
same
spot
for
many
generations
it
comes
to
be
in
the
course
of
time
a
museum
of
heirlooms
gifts
and
trophies
of
the
adventures
and
exploits
of
the
family
he
is
very
fond
of
silver
plate
and
though
he
have
no
gallery
of
portraits
of
his
ancestors
he
has
of
their
and
porringers
incredible
amounts
of
plate
are
found
in
good
houses
and
the
poorest
have
some
spoon
or
saucepan
gift
of
a
godmother
saved
out
of
better
times
an
english
family
consists
of
a
few
persons
who
from
youth
to
age
are
found
revolving
within
a
few
feet
of
each
other
as
if
tied
by
some
invisible
ligature
tense
as
that
cartilage
which
we
have
seen
attaching
the
two
siamese
england
produces
under
favorable
conditions
of
ease
and
culture
the
finest
women
in
the
world
and
as
the
men
are
affectionate
and
the
women
inspire
and
refine
them
nothing
can
be
more
delicate
without
being
fantastical
nothing
more
firm
and
based
in
nature
and
sentiment
than
the
courtship
and
mutual
carriage
of
the
sexes
the
song
of
says
the
wife
of
every
englishman
is
counted
blest
the
sentiment
of
imogen
in
cymbeline
is
copied
from
english
nature
and
not
less
the
portia
of
brutus
the
kate
percy
and
the
desdemona
the
romance
does
not
exceed
the
height
of
noble
passion
in
lucy
hutchinson
or
in
lady
russell
or
even
as
one
discerns
through
the
plain
prose
of
pepys
s
diary
the
sacred
habit
of
an
english
wife
sir
samuel
romilly
could
not
bear
the
death
of
his
wife
every
class
has
its
noble
and
tender
examples
domesticity
is
the
taproot
which
enables
the
nation
to
branch
wide
and
high
the
motive
and
end
of
their
trade
and
empire
is
to
guard
the
independence
and
privacy
of
their
homes
nothing
so
much
marks
their
manners
as
the
concentration
on
their
household
ties
this
domesticity
is
carried
into
court
and
camp
wellington
governed
india
and
spain
and
his
own
troops
and
fought
battles
like
a
good
paid
his
debts
and
though
general
of
an
army
in
spain
could
not
stir
abroad
for
fear
of
public
creditors
this
taste
for
house
and

merits
has
of
course
its
doting
and
foolish
side
cobbett
attributes
the
huge
popularity
of
perceval
prime
minister
in
to
the
fact
that
he
was
wont
to
go
to

every
sunday
with
a
large
quarto
gilt
under

arm
his

hanging
on
the

followed
by

wordsworth
says
of
the
small
freeholders
of
westmoreland
many
of
these
humble
sons
of
the
hills
had
a
consciousness
that
the
land
which
they
tilled
had
for
more
than
five
hundred
years
been
possessed
by
men
of
the

name
and

grandfather

and

the
english
power
resides
also
in
their
dislike
of
change
they
have
difficulty
in
bringing
their
reason
to
act
and
on
all
occasions
use
their
memory
first
as
soon
as
they
have
rid
themselves
of
some
grievance
and
settled
the
better
practice
they
make
haste
to
fix
it
as
a
finality
and
never
wish
to
hear
of
alteration
more
every
englishman
is
an
embryonic
chancellor
his
instinct
is
to
search
for
a
precedent
the
favorite
phrase
of
their
law
is
a
custom
whereof
the
memory
of
man
runneth
not
back
to
the
contrary
the
barons
say
nolumus
mutari
and
the
cockneys
stifle
the
curiosity
of
the
foreigner
on
the
reason
of
any
practice
with
lord
sir
it
was
always
so
they
hate
innovation
bacon

reformer
chatham
that
confidence
was
a
plant
of
slow
growth
canning
to

the
times
and
wellington
that
habit
was
ten
times
nature
all
their
statesmen
learn
the
irresistibility
of
the
tide
of
custom
and
have
invented
many
fine
phrases
to
cover
this
slowness
of
perception
and
prehensility
of
tail
a
should
be
the
crest
of
england
not
only
because
it
represents
a
power
built
on
the
waves
but
also
the
hard
finish
of
the
men
the
englishman
is
finished
like
a
cowry
or
a
murex
after
the
spire
and
the
spines
are
formed
or
with
the
formation
a
juice
exudes
and
a
hard
enamel
varnishes
every
part
the
keeping
of
the
proprieties
is
as
indispensable
as
clean
linen
no
merit
quite
countervails
the
want
of
this
whilst
this
sometimes
stands
in
lieu
of
all
t
is
in
bad
taste
is
the
most
formidable
word
an
englishman
can
pronounce
but
this
japan
costs
them
dear
there
is
a
prose
in
certain
englishmen
which
exceeds
in
wooden
deadness
all
rivalry
with
other
countrymen
there
is
a
knell
in
the
conceit
and
externality
of
their
voice
which
seems
to
say
all
hope
in
this
gibraltar
of
propriety
mediocrity
gets
intrenched
and
consolidated
and
founded
in
adamant
an
englishman
of
fashion
is
like
one
of
those
souvenirs
bound
in
gold
vellum
enriched
with
delicate
engravings
on
thick
paper
fit
for
the
hands
of
ladies
and
princes
but
with
nothing
in
it
worth
reading
or
remembering
a
severe
decorum
rules
the
court
and
the
cottage
when
thalberg
the
pianist
was
one
evening
performing
before
the
queen
at
windsor
in
a
private
party
the
queen
accompanied
him
with
her
voice
the
circumstance
took
air
and
all
england
shuddered
from
sea
to
sea
the
indecorum
was
never
repeated
cold
repressive
manners
prevail
no
enthusiasm
is
permitted
except
at
the
opera
they
avoid
everything
marked
they
require
a
tone
of
voice
that
excites
no
attention
in
the
room
sir
philip
sidney
is
one
of
the
patron
saints
of
england
of
whom
wotton
said
his
wit
was
the
measure
of
congruity
pretension
and
vaporing
are
once
for
all
distasteful
they
keep
to
the
other
extreme
of
low
tone
in
dress
and
manners
they
avoid
pretension
and
go
right
to
the
heart
of
the
thing
they
hate
nonsense
sentimentalism
and
highflown
expression
they
use
a
studied
plainness
even
brummell
their
fop
was
marked
by
the
severest
simplicity
in
dress
they
value
themselves
on
the
absence
of
everything
theatrical
in
the
public
business
and
on
conciseness
and
going
to
the
point
in
private
affairs
in
an
aristocratical
country
like
england
not
the
trial
by
jury
but
the
dinner
is
the
capital
institution
it
is
the
mode
of
doing
honor
to
a
stranger
to
invite
him
to
eat
and
has
been
for
many
hundred
years
and
they
think
says
the
venetian
traveller
of
no
greater
honor
can
be
conferred
or
received
than
to
invite
others
to
eat
with
them
or
to
be
invited
themselves
and
they
would
sooner
give
five
or
six
ducats
to
provide
an
entertainment
for
a
person
than
a
groat
to
assist
him
in
any
distress
it
is
reserved
to
the
end
of
the
day
the
being
generally
six
in
london
and
if
any
company
is
expected
one
or
two
hours
later
every
one
dresses
for
dinner
in
his
own
house
or
in
another
man
s
the
guests
are
expected
to
arrive
within
half
an
hour
of
the
time
fixed
by
card
of
invitation
and
nothing
but
death
or
mutilation
is
permitted
to
detain
them
the
english
dinner
is
precisely
the
model
on
which
our
own
are
constructed
in
the
atlantic
cities
the
company
sit
one
or
two
hours
before
the
ladies
leave
the
table
the
gentlemen
remain
over
their
wine
an
hour
longer
and
rejoin
the
ladies
in
the
and
take
coffee
the
dress
dinner
generates
a
talent
of
which
reaches
great
perfection
the
stories
are
so
good
that
one
is
sure
they
must
have
been
often
told
before
to
have
got
such
happy

the

perfection
for

the
picturesque
in

our

work
to
fulfil
royal
words
the
mottoes
of
their
families
are
monitory
proverbs
as
say
do
of
the
fairfaxes
and
of
the
house
of
fiennes
nil
of
the
de
veres
to
be
king
of
their
word
is
their
pride
when
they
unmask
cant
they
say
the
english
of
this
is
etc
and
to
give
the
lie
is
the
extreme
insult
the
phrase
of
the
lowest
of
the
people
is
and
their
vulgar
praise
his
word
is
as
good
as
his
bond
they
hate
shuffling
and
equivocation
and
the
cause
is
damaged
in
the
public
opinion
on
which
any
paltering
can
be
fixed
even
lord
chesterfield
with
his
french
breeding
when
he
came
to
define
a
gentleman
declared
that
truth
made
his
distinction
and
nothing
ever
spoken
by
him
would
find
so
hearty
a
suffrage
from
his
nation
the
duke
of
wellington
who
had
the
best
right
to
say
so
advises
the
french
general
kellermann
that
he
may
rely
on
the
parole
of
an
english
officer
the
english
of
all
classes
value
themselves
on
this
trait
as
distinguishing
them
from
the
french
who
in
the
popular
belief
are
more
polite
than
true
an
englishman
understates
avoids
the
superlative
checks
himself
in
compliments
alleging
that
in
the
french
language
one
can
not
speak
without
lying
they
love
reality
in
wealth
power
hospitality
and
do
not
easily
learn
to
make
a
show
and
take
the
world
as
it
goes
they
are
not
fond
of
ornaments
and
if
they
wear
them
they
must
be
gems
they
read
gladly
in
old
fuller
that
a
lady
in
the
reign
of
elizabeth
would
have
as
patiently
digested
a
lie
as
the
wearing
of
false
stones
or
pendants
of
counterfeit
pearl
they
have
the
or
preference
for
property
in
land
which
is
said
to
mark
the
teutonic
nations
they
build
of
stone
public
and
private
buildings
are
massive
and
durable
in
comparing
their
ships
houses
and
public
offices
with
the
american
it
is
commonly
said
that
they

a

where
we

plain

clothes
plain
rich

plain
rich
finish
throughout
their

and

mark
the
english
truth
they
confide
in
each
other
english
believes
in
english
the
french
feel
the
superiority
of
this
probity
the
englishman
is
not
springing
a
trap
for
his
admiration
but
is
honestly
minding
his
business
the
frenchman
is
vain
madame
de
sta√´l
says
that
the
english
irritated
napoleon
mainly
because
they
have
found
out
how
to
unite
success
with
honesty
she
was
not
aware
how
wide
an
application
her
foreign
readers
would
give
to
the
remark
wellington
discovered
the
ruin
of
bonaparte
s
affairs
by
his
own
probity
he
augured
ill
of
the
empire
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
it
was
mendacious
and
lived
by
war
if
war
do
not
bring
in
its
sequel
new
trade
better
agriculture
and
manufactures
but
only
games
fireworks
and
spectacles
no
prosperity
could
support
it
much
less
a
nation
decimated
for
conscripts
and
out
of
pocket
like
france
so
he
drudged
for
years
on
his
military
works
at
lisbon
and
from
this
base
at
last
extended
his
gigantic
lines
to
waterloo
believing
in
his
countrymen
and
their
syllogisms
above
all
the
rhodomontade
of
europe
at
a
george
s
festival
in
montreal
where
i
happened
to
be
a
guest
since
my
return
home
i
observed
that
the
chairman
complimented
his
compatriots
by
saying
they
confided
that
wherever
they
met
an
englishman
they
found
a
man
who
would
speak
the
truth
and
one
can
not
think
this
festival
fruitless
if
all
over
the
world
on
the
of
april
wherever
two
or
three
english
are
found
they
meet
to
encourage
each
other
in
the
nationality
of
veracity
in
the
power
of
saying
rude
truth
sometimes
in
the
lion
s
mouth
no
men
surpass
them
on
the
king
s
birthday
when
each
bishop
was
expected
to
offer
the
king
a
purse
of
gold
latimer
gave
henry
viii
a
copy
of
the
vulgate
with
a
mark
at
the
passage
whoremongers
and
adulterers
god
will
judge
and
they
so
honor
stoutness
in
each
other
that
the
king
passed
it
over
they
are
tenacious
of
their
belief
and
can
not
easily
change
their
opinions
to
suit
the
hour
they
are
like
ships
with
too
much
head
on
to
come
quickly
about
nor
will
prosperity
or
even
adversity
be
allowed
to
shake
their
habitual
view
of
conduct
whilst
i
was
in
london
guizot
arrived
there
on
his
escape
from
paris
in
february
many
private
friends
called
on
him
his
name
was
immediately
proposed
as
an
honorary
member
to
the
athen√¶um
guizot
was
blackballed
certainly
they
knew
the
distinction
of
his
name
but
the
englishman
is
not
fickle
he
had
really
made
up
his
mind
now
for
years
as
he
read
his
newspaper
to
hate
and
despise
guizot
and
the
altered
position
of
the
man
as
an
illustrious
exile
and
a
guest
in
the
country
makes
no
difference
to
him
as
it
would
instantly
to
an
american
they
require
the
same
adherence
thorough
conviction
and
reality
in
public
men
it
is
the
want
of
character
which
makes
the
low
reputation
of
the
irish
members
see
them
they
said
one
hundred
and
all
voting
like
sheep
never
proposing
anything
and
all
but
four
voting
the
income
tax
which
was
an
concession
of
the
government
relieving
irish
property
from
the
burdens
charged
on
english
they
have
a
horror
of
adventurers
in
or
out
of
parliament
the
ruling
passion
of
englishmen
in
these
days
is
a
terror
of
humbug
in
the
same
proportion
they
value
honesty
stoutness
and
adherence
to
your
own
they
like
a
man
committed
to
his
objects
they
hate
the
french
as
frivolous
they
hate
the
irish
as
aimless
they
hate
the
germans
as
professors
in
february
they
said
look
the
french
king
and
his
party
fell
for
want
of
a
shot
they
had
not
conscience
to
shoot
so
entirely
was
the
pith
and
heart
of
monarchy
eaten
out
they
attack
their
own
politicians
every
day
on
the
same
grounds
as
adventurers
they
love
stoutness
in
standing
for
your
right
in
declining
money
or
promotion
that
costs
any
concession
the
barrister
refuses
the
silk
gown
of

it
one

earlier
lord
collingwood
would
not
accept
his
medal
for

on
february
if
he
did
not
receive
one
for

on

and
the
medal
was
accorded
when
castlereagh
dissuaded
lord
wellington
from
going
to
the
king
s
levee
until
the
unpopular
cintra
business
had
been
explained
he
replied
you
furnish
me
a
reason
for
going
i
will
go
to
this
or
i
will
never
go
to
a
king

the
radical
mob
at
oxford
cried
after
the
tory
lord
eldon
there
s
old
eldon
cheer
him
he
never
ratted
they
have
given
the
parliamentary
nickname
of
to
the
whom
english
character
does
not
it
is
an
unlucky
moment
to
remember
these
sparkles
of
solitary
virtue
in
the
face
of
the
honors
lately
paid
in
england
to
the
emperor
louis
napoleon
i
am
sure
that
no
englishman
whom
i
had
the
happiness
to
know
consented
when
the
aristocracy
and
the
commons
of
london
cringed
like
a
neapolitan
rabble
before
a
successful
thief
but
how
to
resist
one
step
though
odious
in
a
linked
series
of
state
necessities
governments
must
always
learn
too
late
that
the
use
of
dishonest
agents
is
as
ruinous
for
nations
as
for
single
men
they
are
very
liable
in
their
politics
to
extraordinary
delusions
thus
to
believe
what
stands
recorded
in
the
gravest
books
that
the
movement
of
april
was
urged
or
assisted
by
foreigners
which
to
be
sure
is
paralleled
by
the
democratic
whimsey
in
this
country
which
i
have
noticed
to
be
shared
by
men
sane
on
other
points
that
the
english
are
at
the
bottom
of
the
agitation
of
slavery
in
american
politics
and
then
again
to
the
french
popular
legends
on
the
subject
of
but
suspicion
will
make
fools
of
nations
as
of
citizens
a
slow
temperament
makes
them
less
rapid
and
ready
than
other
countrymen
and
has
given
occasion
to
the
observation
that
english
wit
comes
afterwards
which
the
french
denote
as
d
this
dulness
makes
their
attachment
to
home
and
their
adherence
in
all
foreign
countries
to
home
habits
the
englishman
who
visits
mount
etna
will
carry
his
teakettle
to
the
top
the
old
italian
author
of
the
relation
of
england
in
says
i
have
it
on
the
best
information
that
when
the
war
is
actually
raging
most
furiously
they
will
seek
for
good
eating
and
all
their
other
comforts
without
thinking
what
harm
might
befall
them
then
their
eyes
seem
to
be
set
at
the
bottom
of
a
tunnel
and
they
affirm
the
one
small
fact
they
know
with
the
best
faith
in
the
world
that
nothing
else
exists
and
as
their
own
belief
in
guineas
is
perfect
they
readily
on
all
occasions
apply
the
pecuniary
argument
as
final
thus
when
the
rochester
rappings
began
to
be
heard
of
in
england
a
man
deposited
in
a
sealed
box
in
the
dublin
bank
and
then
advertised
in
the
newspapers
to
all
somnambulists
mesmerizers
and
others
that
whoever
could
tell
him
the
number
of
his
note
should
have
the
money
he
let
it
lie
there
six
months
the
newspapers
now
and
then
at
his
instance
stimulating
the
attention
of
the
adepts
but
none
could
ever
tell
him
and
he
said
now
let
me
never
be
bothered
more
with
this
proven
lie
it
is
told
of
a
good
sir
john
that
he
heard
a
case
stated
by
counsel
and
made
up
his
mind
then
the
counsel
for
the
other
side
taking
their
turn
to
speak
he
found
himself
so
unsettled
and
perplexed
that
he
exclaimed
so
help
me
god
i
will
never
listen
to
evidence
again
any
number
of
delightful
examples
of
this
english
stolidity
are
the
anecdotes
of
europe
i
knew
a
very
worthy
man
a
magistrate
i
believe
he
was
in
the
town
of
derby
who
went
to
the
opera
to
see
malibrau
in
one
scene
the
heroine
was
to
rush
across
a
ruined
bridge
arose
and
mildly
yet
firmly
called
the
attention
of
the
audience
and
the
performers
to
the
fact
that
in
his
judgment
the
bridge
was
unsafe
this
english
stolidity
contrasts
with
french
wit
and
tact
the
french
it
is
commonly
said
have
greatly
more
influence
in
europe
than
the
english
what
influence
the
english
have
is
by
brute
force
of
wealth
and
power
that
of
the
french
by
affinity
and
talent
the
italian
is
subtle
the
spaniard
treacherous
tortures
it
was
said
could
never
wrest
from
an
egyptian
the
confession
of
a
secret
none
of
these
traits
belong
to
the
englishman
his
choler
and
conceit
force
everything
out
defoe
who
knew
his
countrymen
well
says
of
them
in
close
intrigue
their
faculty
s
but
weak
for
generally
whate
er
they
know
they
speak
and
often
their
own
counsels
undermine
by
mere
infirmity
without
design
from
whence
the
learned
say
it
doth
proceed
that
english
treasons
never
can
succeed
for
they
re
so
you
may
know
their
own
most
secret
thoughts
and
others
too
chapter
character
the
english
race
are
reputed
morose
i
do
not
know
that
they
have
sadder
brows
than
their
neighbors
of
northern
climates
they
are
sad
by
comparison
with
the
singing
and
dancing
nations
not
sadder
but
slow
and
staid
as
finding
their
joys
at
home
they
too
believe
that
where
there
is
no
enjoyment
of
life
there
can
be
no
vigor
and
art
in
speech
or
thought
that
your
merry
heart
goes
all
the
way
your
sad
one
tires
in
a
mile
this
trait
of
gloom
has
been
fixed
on
them
by
french
travellers
who
from
froissart
voltaire
le
sage
mirabeau
down
to
the
lively
journalists
of
the
have
spent
their
wit
on
the
solemnity
of
their
neighbors
the
french
say
gay
conversation
is
unknown
in
their
island
the
englishman
finds
no
relief
from
reflection
except
in
reflection
when
he
wishes
for
amusement
he
goes
to
work
his
hilarity
is
like
an
attack
of
fever
religion
the
theatre
and
the
reading
the
books
of
his
country
all
feed
and
increase
his
natural
melancholy
the
police
does
not
interfere
with
public
diversions
it
thinks
itself
bound
in
duty
to
respect
the
pleasures
and
rare
gayety
of
this
inconsolable
nation
and
their
courage
is
entirely
attributable
to
their
disgust
of
life
i
suppose
their
gravity
of
demeanor
and
their
few
words
have
obtained
this
reputation
as
compared
with
the
americans
i
think
them
cheerful
and
contented
young
people
in
our
country
are
much
more
prone
to
melancholy
the
english
have
a
mild
aspect
and
a
ringing
cheerful
voice
they
are
and
not
so
easily
amused
as
the
southerners
and
are
among
them
as
grown
people
among
children
requiring
war
or
trade
or
engineering
or
science
instead
of
frivolous
games
they
are
proud
and
private
and
even
if
disposed
to
recreation
will
avoid
an
open
garden
they
sported
sadly
s
amusaient
tristement
selon
la
coutume
de
leur
said
froissart
and
i
suppose
never
nation
built
their
party
walls
so
thick
or
their
garden
fences
so
high
meat
and
wine
produce
no
effect
on
them
they
are
just
as
cold
quiet
and
composed
at
the
end
as
at
the
beginning
of
dinner
the
reputation
of
taciturnity
they
have
enjoyed
for
six
or
seven
hundred
years
and
a
kind
of
pride
in
bad
public
speaking
is
noted
in
the
house
of
commons
as
if
they
were
willing
to
show
that
they
did
not
live
by
their
tongues
or
thought
they
spoke
well
enough
if
they
had
the
tone
of
gentlemen
in
mixed
company
they
shut
their
mouths
a
yorkshire
told
me
he
had
ridden
more
than
once
all
the
way
from
london
to
leeds
in
the
carriage
with
the
same
persons
and
no
word
exchanged
the
were
established
to
cultivate
social
habits
and
it
is
rare
that
more
than
two
eat
together
and
oftenest
one
eats
alone
was
it
then
a
stroke
of
humor
in
the
serious
swedenborg
or
was
it
only
his
pitiless
logic
that
made
him
shut
up
the
english
souls
in
a
heaven
by
themselves
they
are
contradictorily
described
as
sour
splenetic
and
stubborn
and
as
mild
sweet
and
sensible
the
truth
is
they
have
great
range
and
variety
of
character
commerce
sends
abroad
multitudes
of
different
classes
the
choleric
welshman
the
fervid
scot
the
bilious
resident
in
the
east
or
west
indies
are
wide
of
the
perfect
behavior
of
the
educated
and
dignified
man
of
family
so
is
the
burly
farmer
so
is
the
country
squire
with
his
narrow
and
violent
life
in
every
inn
is
the
in
which
travellers
or
bagmen
who
carry
patterns
and
solicit
orders
for
the
manufacturers
are
wont
to
be
entertained
it
easily
happens
that
this
class
should
characterize
england
to
the
foreigner
who
meets
them
on
the
road
and
at
every
public
house
whilst
the
gentry
avoid
the
taverns
or
seclude
themselves
whilst
in
them
but
these
classes
are
the
right
english
stock
and
may
fairly
show
the
national
qualities
before
yet
art
and
education
have
dealt
with
them
they
are
good
lovers
good
haters
slow
but
obstinate
admirers
and
in
all
things
very
much
steeped
in
their
temperament
like
men
hardly
awaked
from
deep
sleep
which
they
enjoy
their
habits
and
instincts
cleave
to
nature
they
are
of
the
earth
earthy
and
of
the
sea
as
the
attached
to
it
for
what
it
yields
them
and
not
from
any
sentiment
they
are
full
of
coarse
strength
rude
exercise
butcher
s
meat
and
sound
sleep
and
suspect
any
poetic
insinuation
or
any
hint
for
the
conduct
of
life
which
reflects
on
this
animal
existence
as
if
somebody
were
fumbling
at
the
umbilical
cord
and
might
stop
their
supplies
they
doubt
a
man
s
sound
judgment
if
he
does
not
eat
with
appetite
and
shake
their
heads
if
he
is
particularly
chaste
take
them
as
they
come
you
shall
find
in
the
common
people
a
surly
indifference
sometimes
gruffness

he
was
a
very
bold
man
uttered
anything
that
came
into
his
mind
not
only
among
his
companions

in
public
and
would
often
speak
his
mind
of
particular
persons
then
accidentally
present
without
examining
the
company
he
was
in
for
which
he
was
often
reprimanded
and
several
times
threatened
to
be
kicked
and
beaten
the
common
englishman

prone
to
forget
a
cardinal
article
in
the
bill
of
social
rights
that
every
man
has
a
right
to
his

no
man
can
claim
to
usurp
more
than
a
few
cubic
feet
of
the
audibilities
of
a
public
room

to
put
upon
the
company
the
loud
statements
of
his

he

there
with
his

face

with

which
he
defies
on
deliberate
choice

from

of

he

this

they

more

when

they

the

about

arrogant

they
are
testy
and
headstrong
through
an
excess
of

and

churlish
as
men
sometimes
please
to
be
who
do
not

a

who
ask
no

and
who
will
do
what
they

with

with

wear
off

leave

i
suppose
the

will
hereafter
be
found
in
the

not
found
in

differencing

anticipate
another

that
this

nothing
savage
nothing

resides

they
are
subject
to
panics

the
temper

itself

easily

the

should
see
how
english
hold
out

they

an
unctuous

there
is
an

if

without
damaging
themselves
even
the
scale
of

on
which
people
live
and
to
which
scholars

conform
proves
the
tension
of

can
each
lift

by

have
suspected
that
he

the

passage
from

almost
stand
as
a
portrait
of
the
modern
englishman
haldor
was
very
stout
and
strong
and
remarkably
handsome
in
appearances
king
harold
gave
him
this
testimony
that
he
among
all
his
men
cared
least
about
doubtful
circumstances
whether
they
betokened
danger
or
pleasure
for
whatever
turned
up
he
was
never
in
higher
nor
in
lower
spirits
never
slept
less
nor
more
on
account
of
them
nor
ate
nor
drank
but
according
to
his
custom
haldor
was
not
a
man
of
many
words
but
short
in
conversation
told
his
opinion
bluntly
and
was
obstinate
and
hard
and
this
could
not
please
the
king
who
had
many
clever
people
about
him
zealous
in
his
service
haldor
remained
a
short
time
with
the
king
and
then
came
to
iceland
where
he
took
up
his
abode
in
hiardaholt
and
dwelt
in
that
farm
to
a
very
advanced
age

which
he
pushes
to
folly
and
the
decided
sympathy
of
his
compatriots
is
engaged
to
back
up
crump
s
whim
by
statutes
and
chancellors
and
there
is
no
freak
so
ridiculous
but
some
englishman
has
attempted
to
immortalize
by
money
and
law
british
citizenship
is
as
omnipotent
as
roman
was
cockayne
is
very
sensible
of
this
the
pursy
man
means
by
freedom
the
right
to
do
as
he
pleases
and
does
wrong
in
order
to
feel
his
freedom
and
makes
a
conscience
of
persisting
in
it
he
is
intensely
patriotic
for
his
country
is
so
small
his
confidence
in
the
power
and
performance
of
his
nation
makes
him
provokingly
incurious
about
other
nations
he
dislikes
foreigners
swedenborg
who
lived
much
in
england
notes
the
similitude
of
minds
among
the
english
in
consequence
of
which
they
contract
familiarity
with
friends
who
are
of
that
nation
and
seldom
with
others
and
they
regard
foreigners
as
one
looking
through
a
telescope
from
the
top
of
a
palace
regards
those
who
dwell
or
wander
about
out
of
the
city
a
much
older
traveller
the
venetian
who
wrote
the
relation
of
england
in
says
the
english
are
great
lovers
of
themselves
and
of
everything
belonging
to
them
they
think
that
there
are
no
other
men
than
themselves
and
no
other
world
but
england
and
whenever
they
see
a
handsome
foreigner
they
say
that
he
looks
like
an
englishman
and
it
is
a
great
pity
he
should
not
be
an
englishman
and
whenever
they
partake
of
any
delicacy
with
a
foreigner
they
ask
him
whether
such
a
thing
is
made
in
his
country
when
he
adds
epithets
of
praise
his
climax
is
so
english
and
when
he
wishes
to
pay
you
the
highest
compliment
he
says
i
should
not
know
you
from
an
englishman
france
is
by
its
natural
contrast
a
kind
of
blackboard
on
which
english
character
draws
its
own
traits
in
chalk
this
arrogance
habitually
exhibits
itself
in
allusions
to
the
french
i
suppose
that
all
men
of
english
blood
in
america
europe
or
asia
have
a
secret
feeling
of
joy
that
they
are
not
french
natives
coleridge
is
said
to
have
given
public
thanks
to
god
at
the
close
of
a
lecture
that
he
had
defended
him
from
being
able
to
utter
a
single
sentence
in
the
french
language
i
have
found
that
englishmen
have
such
a
good
opinion
of
england
that
the
ordinary
phrases
in
all
good
society
of
postponing
or
disparaging
one
s
own
things
in
talking
with
a
stranger
are
seriously
mistaken
by
them
for
an
insuppressible
homage
to
the
merits
of
their
nation
and
the
or
pennsylvanian
who
modestly
laments
the
disadvantage
of
a
new
country
and
savages
is
surprised
by
the
instant
and
unfeigned
commiseration
of
the
whole
company
who
plainly
account
all
the
world
out
of
england
a
heap
of
rubbish
printed
by
the
camden
society
the
same
insular
limitation
pinches
his
foreign
politics
he
sticks
to
his
traditions
and
usages
and
so
help
him
god
he
will
force
his
island
down
the
throat
of
great
countries
like
india
china
canada
australia
and
not
only
so
but
impose
wapping
on
the
congress
of
vienna
and
trample
down
all
nationalities
with
his
taxed
boots
lord
chatham
goes
for
liberty
and
no
taxation
without
representation
for
that
is
british
law
but
not
a
hobnail
shall
they
dare
make
in
america
but
buy
their
nails
in
england
for
that
also
is
british
law
and
the
fact
that
british
commerce
was
to
be
by
the
independence
of
america
took
them
all
by
surprise
in
short
i
am
afraid
that
english
nature
is
so
rank
and
aggressive
as
to
be
a
little
incompatible
with
every
other
the
world
is
not
wide
enough
for
two
but
beyond
this
nationality
it
must
be
admitted
the
island
offers
a
daily
worship
to
the
old
norse
god
brage
celebrated
among
our
scandinavian
forefathers
for
his
eloquence
and
majestic
air
the
english
have
a
steady
courage
that
fits
them
for
great
attempts
and
endurance
they
have
also
a
petty
courage
through
which
every
man
delights
in
showing
himself
for
what
he
is
and
in
doing
what
he
can
so
that
in
all
companies
each
of
them
has
too
good
an
opinion
of
himself
to
imitate
anybody
he
hides
no
defect
of
his
form
features
dress
connection
or
birthplace
for
he
thinks
every
circumstance
belonging
to
him
comes
recommended
to
you
if
one
of
them
have
a
bald
or
a
red
or
a
green
head
or
bow
legs
or
a
scar
or
mark
or
a
paunch
or
a
squeaking
or
a
raven
voice
he
has
persuaded
himself
that
there
is
something
modish
and
becoming
in
it
and
that
it
sits
well
on
him
but
nature
makes
nothing
in
vain
and
this
little
superfluity
of
in
the
english
brain
is
one
of
the
secrets
of
their
power
and
history
it
sets
every
man
on
being
and
doing
what
he
really
is
and
can
it
takes
away
a
dodging
skulking
secondary
air
and
encourages
a
frank
and
manly
bearing
so
that
each
man
makes
the
most
of
himself
and
loses
no
opportunity
for
want
of
pushing
a
man
s
personal
defects
will
commonly
have
with
the
rest
of
the
world
precisely
that
importance
which
they
have
to
himself
if
he
makes
light
of
them
so
will
other
men
we
all
find
in
these
a
convenient
meter
of
character
since
a
little
man
would
be
ruined
by
the
vexation
i
remember
a
shrewd
politician
in
one
of
our
western
cities
told
me
that
he
had
known
several
successful
statesmen
made
by
their
foible
and
another
an
of
illinois
said
to
me
if
a
man
knew
anything
he
would
sit
in
a
corner
and
be
modest
but
he
is
such
an
ignorant
peacock
that
he
goes
bustling
up
and
down
and
hits
on
extraordinary
discoveries
there
is
also
this
benefit
in
brag
that
the
speaker
is
unconsciously
expressing
his
own
ideal
humor
him
by
all
means
draw
it
all
out
and
hold
him
to
it
their
culture
generally
enables
the
travelled
english
to
avoid
any
ridiculous
extremes
of
this
and
to
give
it
an
agreeable
air
then
the
natural
disposition
is
fostered
by
the
respect
which
they
find
entertained
in
the
world
for
english
ability
it
was
said
of
louis
that
his
gait
and
air
were
becoming
enough
in
so
great
a
monarch
yet
would
have
been
ridiculous
in
another
man
so
the
prestige
of
the
english
name
warrants
a
certain
confident
bearing
which
a
frenchman
or
belgian
could
not
carry
at
all
events
they
feel
themselves
at
liberty
to
assume
the
most
extraordinary
tone
on
the
subject
of
english
merits
an
english
lady
on
the
rhine
hearing
a
german
speaking
of
her
party
as
foreigners
exclaimed
no
we
are
not
foreigners
we
are
english
it
is
you
that
are
foreigners
they
tell
you
daily
in
london
the
story
of
the
frenchman
and
englishman
who
quarrelled
both
were
unwilling
to
fight
but
their
companions
put
them
up
to
it
at
last
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
fight
alone
in
the
dark
and
with
pistols
the
candles
were
put
out
and
the
englishman
to
make
sure
not
to
hit
anybody
fired
up
the
chimney
and
brought
down
the
frenchman
they
have
no
curiosity
about
foreigners
and
answer
any
information
you
may
volunteer
with
oh
oh
until
the
informant
makes
up
his
mind
that
they
shall
die
in
their
ignorance
for
any
help
he
will
offer
there
are
really
no
limits
to
this
conceit
though
brighter
men
among
them
make
painful
efforts
to
be
candid
the
habit
of
brag
runs
through
all
classes
from
the
newspaper
through
politicians
and
poets
through
wordsworth
carlyle
mill
and
sydney
smith
down
to
the
boys
of
eton
in
the
gravest
treatise
on
political
economy
in
a
philosophical
essay
in
books
of
science
one
is
surprised
by
the
most
innocent
exhibition
of
unflinching
nationality
in
a
tract
on
corn
a
most
amiable
and
accomplished
gentleman
writes
thus
though
britain
according
to
bishop
berkeley
s
idea
were
surrounded
by
a
wall
of
brass
ten
thousand
cubits
in
height
still
she
would
as
far
excel
the
rest
of
the
globe
in
riches
as
she
now
does
both
in
this
secondary
quality
and
in
the
more
important
ones

and

william

the
english
dislike
the
american
structure
of

whilst
yet

and

doing
what
they
can
to
create
in

the
same
social
condition
america

the
paradise
of

the
favorable
exception
invariably
quoted
to
the
rules
of
ruin
but
when
he
speaks
directly
of
the
americans
the
islander
forgets
his
philosophy
and
remembers
his
disparaging
anecdotes
but
this
childish
patriotism
costs
something
like
all
narrowness
the
english
sway
of
their
colonies
has
no
root
of
kindness
they
govern
by
their
arts
and
ability
they
are
more
just
than
kind
and
whenever
an
abatement
of
their
power
is
felt
they
have
not
conciliated
the
affection
on
which
to
rely
coarse
local
distinctions
as
those
of
nation
province
or
town
are
useful
in
the
absence
of
real
ones
but
we
must
not
insist
on
these
accidental
lines
individual
traits
are
always
triumphing
over
national
ones
there

√¶sop

to

to
carry
the
boisterous

in

on
this
very
point
of
national
pride
george
of
cappadocia
born
at
epiphania
in
cilicia
was
a
low
parasite
who
got
a
lucrative
contract
to
supply
the
army
with
bacon
a
rogue
and
informer
he
got
rich
and
was
forced
to
run
from

he
saved
his
money
embraced
arianism
collected
a
library
and
got
promoted
by
a
faction
to
the
episcopal
throne
of
alexandria
when
julian
came
george
was
dragged
to
prison
the
prison
was
burst
open
by
the
mob
and
george
was
lynched
as
he
deserved
and
this
precious
knave
became
in
good
time
saint
george
of
england
patron
of
chivalry
emblem
of
victory
and
civility
and
the
pride
of
the
best
blood
of
the
modern
world
strange
that
the
solid
briton
should
derive
from
an
impostor
strange
that
the
new

should
have
no
better
luck
that
broad

must
wear

thus
nobody

are
equally
badly
off

the
false
is
an
offset
to
the
false
chapter
wealth
there
is
no
country
in
which
so
absolute
a
homage
is
paid
to
wealth
in

there
is
a
touch
of
shame
when
a
man
exhibits
the
evidences
of
large
property
as
if
after
all
it
needed
apology
but
the
englishman
has
pure
pride
in
his
wealth
and
esteems
it
a
final
certificate
a
coarse
logic
rules
throughout
all
english
souls
if
you

merit
can
you
not

how
can

they

an

in

to

private
and
scholastic
life
of
the
grave
moral
deterioration
which
follows
an
empty
exchequer
you
shall
find
this
sentiment
if
not
so
frankly
put
yet
deeply
implied
in
the
novels
and
romances
of
the
present
century
and
not

i
found
the

in

good
thing
t
was
not
so
among
the
lower
orders
better
take
them
away
from
those
who
might
deprave
them
and
it
was
highly
injurious
to
trade
to
stop
binding
to
manufacturers
as
it
must
raise
the
price
of
labor
and
of

goods
the
respect

of

in

is
equalled
only
by
the
respect
for

it
is
at
once
the
pride
of
art
of
the
saxon
as
he
is
a
and
his
passion
for
independence
the
englishman
believes
that
every
man
must
take
care
of
himself
and
has
himself
to
thank
if
he
do
not
mend
his

the

an
inch
of

by
dint
of
enormous
taxes
were
subsidizing
all
the
continent
against

the
english
were
growing
rich
every

faster
than
any
people
ever
grew
before
it
is
their
maxim
that
the
weight
of
taxes
must
be
calculated
not
by
what
is
taken
but
by
what
is
left

this

from

t
is
a
curious
chapter
in
modern
history
the
growth
of
the
six
hundred
years
ago
roger
bacon
explained
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
the
consequent
necessity
of
the
reform
of
the
calendar
measured
the
length
of
the
year
invented
gunpowder
and
announced
as
if
looking
from
his
lofty
cell
over
five
centuries
into
ours
that
machines
can
be
constructed
to
drive
ships
more
rapidly
than
a
whole
galley
of
rowers
could
do
nor
would
they
need
anything
but
a
pilot
to
steer
them
carriages
also
might
be
constructed
to
move
with
an
incredible
speed
without
the
aid
of
any
animal
finally
it
would
not
be
impossible
to
make
machines
which
by
means
of
a
suit
of
wings
should
fly
in
the
air
in
the
manner
of
birds
but
the
secret
slept
with
bacon
the
six
hundred
years
have
not
yet
fulfilled
his
words
two
centuries
ago
the
sawing
of
timber
was
done
by
hand
the
ran
on
wooden
axles
the
land
was
tilled
by
wooden
ploughs
and
it
was
to
little
purpose
that
they
had
or
that
looms
were
improved
unless
watt
and
stephenson
had
taught
them
to
work
and
by
steam
the
great
strides
were
all
taken
within
the
last
hundred
years
the
life
of
sir
robert
peel
in
his
day
the
model
englishman
very
properly
has
for
a
frontispiece
a
drawing
of
the
which
wove
the
web
of
his
fortunes
hargreaves
invented
the
and
died
in
a
workhouse
arkwright
improved
the
invention
and
the
machine
dispensed
with
the
work
of
men
that
is
one
spinner
could
do
as
much
work
as
one
hundred
had
done
before
the
loom
was
improved
further
but
the
men
would
sometimes
strike
for
wages
and
combine
against
the
masters
and
about
much
fear
was
felt
lest
the
trade
would
be
drawn
away
by
these
interruptions
and
the
emigration
of
the
spinners
to
belgium
and
the
united
states
iron
and
steel
are
very
obedient
whether
it
were
not
possible
to
make
a
spinner
that
would
not
rebel
nor
mutter
nor
scowl
nor
strike
for
wages
nor
emigrate
at
the
solicitation
of
the
masters
after
a
mob
and
riot
at
staley
bridge
roberts
of
manchester
undertook
to
create
this
peaceful
fellow
instead
of
the
quarrelsome
fellow
god
had
made
after
a
few
trials
he
succeeded
and
in
procured
a
patent
for
his
mule
a
creation
the
delight
of
and
destined
they
said
to
restore
order
among
the
industrious
classes
a
machine
requiring
only
a
child
s
hand
to
piece
the
broken
yarns
as
arkwright
had
destroyed
domestic
spinning
so
roberts
destroyed
the
factory
spinner
the
power
of
machinery
in
great
britain
in
mills
has
been
computed
to
be
equal
to
men
one
man
being
able
by
the
aid
of
steam
to
do
the
work
which
required
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
to
accomplish
fifty
years
ago
the
production
has
been
commensurate
england
already
had
this
laborious
race
rich
soil
water
wood
coal
iron
and
favorable
climate
eight
hundred
years
ago
commerce
had
made
it
rich

it
was

england

the
richest

all
the
northern

the
norman
historians
recite
that

william

with
him
into
normandy
from
england
more
gold

silver
than
had
ever
before
been
seen
in

but
when
to
this
labor

and
these
native
resources
was
added
this
goblin
of
steam
with
his
myriad
arms
never
tired
working

everlastingly

that

a
better

the

that
there
is

another

for

of

it

the

into
the
competition
as
stockholders
in
the
mine
the

the
railway
in
the
application
of
steam
to
agriculture

sometimes
into

it

as
the
proof
of
their

sir
edward
boynton
at

at
cadenham
on
a
precipice
of
incomparable
prospect
built
a

strawberry

walpole
fonthill
abbey
of
beckford
were
freaks
and
newstead
abbey
became
one
in
the
hands
of
lord
byron
but
the
proudest
result
of
this
creation
has
been
the
great
and
refined
forces
it
has
put
at
the
disposal
of
the
private
citizen
in
the
social
world
an
englishman
has
the
best
lot
he
is
a
king
in
a
plain
coat
he
goes
with
the
most
powerful
protection
keeps
the
best
company
is
armed
by
the
best
education
is
seconded
by
wealth
and
his
english
name
and
accidents
are
like
a
flourish
of
trumpets
announcing
him
this
with
his
quiet
style
of
manners
gives
him
the
power
of
a
sovereign
without
the
inconveniences
which
belong
to
that
rank
i
much
prefer
the
condition
of
an
english
gentleman
of
the
better
class
to
that
of
any
potentate
in
europe
whether
for
travel
or
for
opportunity
of
society
or
for
access
to
means
of
science
or
study
or
for
mere
comfort
and
easy
healthy
relation
to
people
at

such
as
we
have
seen
is
the
wealth
of
england
a
mighty
mass
and
made
good
in
whatever
details
we
care
to
explore
the
cause
and
spring
of
it
is
the
wealth
of
temperament
in
the
people
the
wonder
of
britain
is
this
plenteous
nature
her
worthies
are
ever
surrounded
by
as
good
men
as
themselves
each
is
a
captain
a
hundred
strong
and
that
wealth
of
men
is
represented
again
in
the
faculty
of
each
individual
that
he
has
waste
strength
power
to
spare
the
english
are
so
rich
and
seem
to
have
established
a
taproot
in
the
bowels
of
the
planet
because
they
are
constitutionally
fertile
and
creative
but
a
man
must
keep
an
eye
on
his
servants
if
he
would
not
have
them
rule
him
man
is
a
shrewd
inventor
and
is
ever
taking
the
hint
of
a
new
machine
from
his
own
structure
adapting
some
secret
of
his
own
anatomy
in
iron
wood
and
leather
to
some
required
function
in
the
work
of
the
world
but
it
is
found
that
the
machine
unmans
the
user
what
he
gains
in
making
cloth
he
loses
in
general
power
there
should
be
temperance
in
making
cloth
as
well
as
in
eating
a
man
should
not
be
a
silkworm
nor
a
nation
a
tent
of
caterpillars
the
robust
rural
saxon
degenerates
in
the
mills
to
the
leicester
stockinger
to
the
imbecile
manchester
spinner
far
on
the
way
to
be
spiders
and
needles
the
incessant
repetition
of
the
same
dwarfs
the
man
robs
him
of
his
strength
wit
and
versatility
to
make
a
a
or
any
other
specialty
and
presently
in
a
change
of
industry
whole
towns
are
sacrificed
like
when
the
fashion
of
shoestrings
supersedes
buckles
when
cotton
takes
the
place
of
linen
or
railways
of
turnpikes
or
when
commons
are
enclosed
by
landlords
then
society
is
admonished
of
the
mischief
of
the
division
of
labor
and
that
the
best
political
economy
is
care
and
culture
of
men
for
in
these
crises
all
are
ruined
except
such
as
are
proper
individuals
capable
of
thought
and
of
new
choice
and
the
application
of
their
talent
to
new
labor
then
again
come
in
new
calamities
england
is
aghast
at
the
disclosure
of
her
fraud
in
the
adulteration
of
food
of
drugs
and
of
almost
every
fabric
in
her
mills
and
shops
finding
that
milk
will
not
nourish
nor
sugar
sweeten
nor
bread
satisfy
nor
pepper
bite
the
tongue
nor
glue
stick
in
true
england
all
is
false
and
forged
this
too
is
the
reaction
of
machinery
but
of
the
larger
machinery
of
commerce
t
is
not
i
suppose
want
of
probity
so
much
as
the
tyranny
of
trade
which
necessitates
a
perpetual
competition
of
underselling
and
that
again
a
perpetual
deterioration
of
the
fabric
the
machinery
has
proved
like
the
balloon
unmanageable
and
flies
away
with
the
aeronaut
steam
from
the
first
hissed
and
screamed
to
warn
him
it
was
dreadful
with
its
explosion
and
crushed
the
engineer
the
machinist
has
wrought
and
watched
engineers
and
firemen
without
number
have
been
sacrificed
in
learning
to
tame
and
guide
the
monster
but
harder
still
it
has
proved
to
resist
and
rule
the
dragon
money
with
his
paper
wings
chancellors
and
boards
of
trade
pitt
peel
and
robinson
and
their
parliaments
and
their
whole
generation
adopted
false
principles
and
went
to
their
graves
in
the
belief
that
they
were
enriching
the
country
which
they
were
impoverishing
they
congratulated
each
other
on
ruinous
expedients
it
is
rare
to
find
a
merchant
who
knows
why
a
crisis
occurs
in
trade
why
prices
rise
or
fall
or
who
knows
the
mischief
of
in
the
culmination
of
national
prosperity
in
the
annexation
of
countries
building
of
ships
depots
towns
in
the
influx
of
tons
of
gold
and
silver
amid
the
chuckle
of
chancellors
and
financiers
it
was
found
that
bread
rose
to
famine
prices
that
the
yeoman
was
forced
to
sell
his
cow
and
pig
his
tools
and
his
acre
of
land
and
the
dreadful
barometer
of
the
was
touching
the
point
of
ruin
the
was
sucking
in
the
solvent
classes
and
forcing
an
exodus
of
farmers
and
mechanics
what
befalls
from
the
violence
of
financial
crises
befalls
daily
in
the
violence
of
artificial
legislation
such
a
wealth
has
england
earned
ever
new
bounteous
and
augmenting
but
the
question
recurs
does
she
take
the
step
beyond
namely
to
the
wise
use
in
view
of
the
supreme
wealth
of
nations
we
estimate
the
wisdom
of
nations
by
seeing
what
they
did
with
their
surplus

in

of
these

some

by

but
the
antidotes

frightfully
inadequate

the

a

no

she
too
is
in

one
victim
more
in
a
common
catastrophe
but
being
in
the
fault
she
has
the
misfortune
of

to
be
held
as
the
chief
offender
england
must
be
held
responsible
for
the
despotism
of
expense
her
prosperity
the
splendor
which
so
much
manhood
and
talent
and
perseverance
has
thrown
upon
vulgar
aims
is
the
very
argument
of
materialism
her
success
strengthens
the
hands
of
base
wealth
who
can
propose
to
youth
poverty
and
wisdom
when
mean
gain
has
arrived
at
the
conquest
of

when
english
success
has
grown
out
of
the
very
renunciation
of
principles
and
the
dedication
to
outsides
a
civility
of
trifles
of
money

expense
an
erudition
of

the

hardly

the

hence
it
has
come
that
not
the

life
but
the
means
of
meeting
a
certain
ponderous
expense
is
that
which
is
to
be
considered
by
a
youth
in
england
emerging
from
his
minority
a
large

is
reckoned
a
misfortune

it
is
a

the

it

the

primogeniture

the

the

the

of

with

with

history
of
europe
and
at
last
with
the

and
the

of

was
too
pleasing
a
vision
to
be
shattered
by
a
few
offensive
realities
and
the
politics
of
shoemakers
and
costermongers
the

of

take

direction
with

which
the

they
are
proud
of

there
was
this
advantage
of

that
this

from

english
history
is
aristocracy
with
the

open
who
has
courage
and
faculty
let
him
come
in
of

the
terms
of

to
this

are
hard
and
high
the
selfishness
of
the

comes
in

of
the

piracy

gave

and
the
but
the
privilege
was
kept
whilst
the
means
of
obtaining
it
were
changed
the
foundations
of
these
families
lie
deep
in
norwegian
exploits
by
sea
and
saxon
sturdiness
on

all
nobility
in
its
beginnings
was
somebody
s
natural
superiority
the
things
these
english
have
done
were
not
done
without
peril
of
life
nor
without
wisdom
and
conduct
and
the
first
hands
it
may
be
presumed
were
often
challenged
to
show
their
right
to
their
honors
or
yield
them
to
better
men
he
that

when
he
carried

he
shall
have
the

said
the
mother
of
alfred
who
can
read
it
and
alfred
won
it
by
that
title
and
i
make
no
doubt
that
feudal
tenure
was
no
sinecure
but
baron
knight
and
tenant
often
had
their
memories
refreshed
in
regard
to
the
service
by
which
they
held
their
lands
the
de
veres
bohuns
mowbrays
and

were
not
addicted
to
contemplation
the
middle
age
adorned
itself
with
proofs
of
manhood
and
devotion
of
richard
beauchamp
earl
of
warwick
the
emperor
told
henry
that
no
christian
king
had
such
another
knight
for
wisdom
nurture
and
manhood
and
caused
him
to
be
named

the

and
died
with
him
fuller

ii
the
earned
his
honors
and
no
donation
of
land
was
large
as
long
as
it
brought
the
duty
of
protecting
it
hour
by
hour
against
a
terrible
enemy
in
france
and
in
england
the
nobles
were
down
to
a
late
day
born
and
bred
to
war
and
the
duel
which
in
peace
still
held
them
to
the
risks
of
war
diminished
the
envy
that
in
trading
and
studious
nations
would
else
have
pried
into
their
title
they
were
looked
on
as
men
who
played
high
for
a
great
stake
great
estates
are
not
sinecures
if
they
are
to
be
kept
great
a
creative
economy
is
the
fuel
of
magnificence
in
the
same
line
of
warwick
the
successor
next
but
one
to
beauchamp
was
the
stout
earl
of
henry
vi
and
edward
iv
few
esteemed
themselves
in
the
mode
whose
heads
were
not
adorned
with
the
black
ragged
staff
his
badge
at
his
house
in
london
six
oxen
were
daily
eaten
at
a
breakfast
and
every
tavern
was
full
of
his
meat
and
who
had
any
acquaintance
in
his
family
should
have
as
much
boiled
and
roast
as
he
could
carry
on
a
long
dagger
the
new
age
brings
new
qualities
into
request
the
virtues
of
pirates
gave
way
to
those
of
planters
merchants
senators
and
scholars
comity
social
talent
and
fine
manners
no
doubt
have
had
their
part
also
i
have
met
somewhere
with
a
historiette
which
whether
more
or
less
true
in
its
particulars
carries
a
general
truth
how
came
the
duke
of
bedford
by
his
great
landed
estates
his
ancestor
having
travelled
on
the
continent
a
lively
pleasant
man
became
the
companion
of
a
foreign
prince
wrecked
on
the
dorsetshire
coast
where
russell
lived
the
prince
recommended
him
to
henry
who
liking
his
company
gave
him
a
large
share
of
the
plundered
church
lands
the
pretence
is
that
the
noble
is
of
unbroken
descent
from
the
norman
and
has
never
worked
for
eight
hundred
years
but
the
fact
is
otherwise
where
is
bohun
where
is
de
vere
the
lawyer
the
farmer
the
lies
under
the
coronet
and
winks
to
the
antiquary
to
say
nothing
especially
skilful
lawyers
nobody
s
sons
who
did
some
piece
of
work
at
a
nice
moment
for
government
and
were
rewarded
with
ermine
the
national
tastes
of
the
english
do
not
lead
them
to
the
life
of
the
courtier
but
to
secure
the
comfort
and
independence
of
their
homes
the
aristocracy
are
marked
by
their
predilection
for
they
are
called
the
they
have
often
no
residence
in
london
and
only
go
thither
for
a
short
time
during
the
season
to
see
the
opera
but
they
concentrate
the
love
and
labor
of
many
generations
on
the
building
planting
and
decoration
of
their
homesteads
some
of
them
are
too
old
and
too
proud
to
wear
titles
or
as
sheridan
said
of
coke
disdain
to
hide
their
head
in
a
coronet
and
some
curious
examples
are
cited
to
show
the
stability
of
english
families
their
proverb
is
that
fifty
miles
from
london
a
family
will
last
a
hundred
years
at
a
hundred
miles
two
hundred
years
and
so
on
but
i
doubt
that
steam
the
enemy
of
time
as
well
as
of
space
will
disturb
these
ancient
rules
sir
henry
wotton
says
of
the
first
duke
of
buckingham
he
was
born
at
brookeby
in
leicestershire
where
his
ancestors
had
chiefly
continued
about
the
space
of
four
hundred
years
rather
without
obscurity
than
with
any
great
lustre
wraxall
says
that
in
lord
surrey
afterwards
duke
of
norfolk
told
him
that
when
the
year
should
arrive
he
meant
to
give
a
grand
festival
to
all
the
descendants
of
the
body
of
jockey
of
norfolk
to
mark
the
day
when
the
dukedom
should
have
remained
three
hundred
years
in
their
house
since
its
creation
by
richard
iii
pepys
tells
us
in

this
long
descent
of
families
and
this
cleaving
through
ages
to
the
same
spot
of
ground
captivates
the
imagination
it
has
too
a
connection
with
the
names
of
the
towns
and
districts
of
the
country
the
names
are
excellent
an
atmosphere
of
legendary
melody
spread
over
the

older
than
all
epics
and
histories
which
clothe

on

also
are

t
is
an
old
sneer
that
the
irish
peerage
drew
their
names
from
playbooks
the
english
lords
do
not
call
their
lands
after
their
own
names
but
call
themselves
after
their
lands
as
if
the
man
represented
the
country
that
bred
him
and
they
rightly
wear
the
token
of
the
glebe
that
gave
them
birth
suggesting
that
the
tie
is
not
cut
but
that
there
in

of
argyle
the
kail
of
cornwall
the
downs
of
devon
the
iron
of
wales
the
clays
of

are
neither
forgetting
nor
forgotten

know
the

who
was
born
by
them

who
like
the
long
line
of
his
fathers
has
carried
that
crag
that
shore
dale
fen
or

in
his

and
manners
it
has
too
the
advantage
of
suggesting
responsibleness
a
susceptible
man
could
not
wear
a
name
which
represented
in
a
strict
sense
a
city
or
a
county
of
england
without
hearing
in
it
a
challenge
to
duty
and
honor

days
only
twenty
or
thirty
where
are
they
i
asked
at
home
on
their
estates
devoured
by
or
in
the
alps
or
up
the
rhine
in
the
harz
mountains
or
in
egypt
or
in
india
on
the
ghauts
but
with
such
interests
at
stake
how
can
these
men
afford
to
neglect
them
o
replied
my
friend
why
should
they
work
for
themselves
when
every
man
in
england
works
for
them
and
will
suffer
before
they
come
to
harm
the
hardest
radical
instantly
uncovers
and
changes
his
tone
to
a
lord
it
was
remarked
on
the
april
the
day
of
the
chartist
demonstration
that
the
upper
classes
were
for
the
first
time
actively
interesting
themselves
in
their
own
defence
and
men
of
rank
were
sworn
special
constables
with
the
rest
besides
why
need
they
sit
out
the
debate
has
not
the
duke
of
wellington
at
this
moment
their
proxies
the
proxies
of
fifty
peers
in
his
pocket
to
vote
for
them
if
there
be
an
emergency
it
is
however
true
that
the
existence
of
the
house
of
peers
as
a
branch
of
the
government
entitles
them
to
fill
half
the
cabinet
and
their
weight
of
property
and
station
gives
them
a
virtual
nomination
of
the
other
half
whilst
they
have
their
share
in
the
subordinate
offices
as
a
school
of
training
this
monopoly
of
political
power
has
given
them
their
intellectual
and
social
eminence
in
europe
a
few
law
lords
and
a
few
political
lords
take
the
brunt
of
public
business
in
the
army
the
nobility
fill
a
large
part
of
the
high
commissions
and
give
to
these
a
tone
of
expense
and
splendor
and
also
of
exclusiveness
they
have
borne
their
full
share
of
duty
and
danger
in
this
service
and
there
are
few
noble
families
which
have
not
paid
in
some
of
their
members
the
debt
of
life
or
limb
in
the
sacrifices
of
the
russian
war
for
the
rest
the
nobility
have
the
lead
in
matters
of
state
and
of
expense
in
questions
of
taste
in
social
usages
in
convivial
and
domestic
hospitalities
in
general
all
that
is
required
of
them
is
to
sit
securely
to
preside
at
public
meetings
to
countenance
charities
and
to
give
the
example
of
that
decorum
so
dear
to
the
british
heart
if
one
asks
in
the
critical
spirit
of
the
day
what
service
this
class
have
rendered
uses
appear
or
they
would
have
perished
long
ago
some
of
these
are
easily
enumerated
others
more
subtle
make
a
part
of
unconscious
history
their
institution
is
one
step
in
the
progress
of
society
for
a
race
yields
a
nobility
in
some
form
however
we
name
the
lords
as
surely
as
it
yields
women
the
english
nobles
are
active
educated
men
born
to
wealth
and
power
who
have
run
through
every
country
and
kept
in
every
country
the
best
company
have
seen
every
secret
of
art
and
nature
and
when
men
of
any
ability
or
ambition
have
been
consulted
in
the
conduct
of
every
important
action
you
can
not
wield
great
agencies
without
lending
yourself
to
them
and
when
it
happens
that
the
spirit
of
the
earl
meets
his
rank
and
duties
we
have
the
best
examples
of
behavior
power
of
any
kind
readily
appears
in
the
manners
and
beneficent
power
talent
de
bien
gives
a
majesty
which
can
not
be
concealed
or
resisted
these
people
seem
to
gain
as
much
as
they
lose
by
their
position
they
survey
society
as
from
the
top
of
paul
s
and
if
they
never
hear
plain
truth
from
men
they
see
the
best
of
everything
in
every
kind
and
they
see
things
so
grouped
and
amassed
as
to
infer
easily
the
sum
and
genius
instead
of
tedious
particularities
their
good
behavior
deserves
all
its
fame
and
they
have
that
simplicity
and
that
air
of
repose
which
are
the
finest
ornament
of
greatness
the
upper
classes
have
only
birth
say
the
people
here
and
not
thoughts
yes
but
they
have
manners
and
t
is
wonderful
how
much
talent
runs
into
manners
nowhere
and
never
so
much
as
in
england
they
have
the
sense
of
superiority
the
absence
of
all
the
ambitious
effort
which
disgusts
in
the
aspiring
classes
a
pure
tone
of
thought
and
feeling
and
the
power
to
command
among
their
other
luxuries
the
presence
of
the
most
accomplished
men
in
their
festive
meetings
loyalty
is
in
the
english
a
they
wear
the
laws
as
ornaments
and
walk
by
their
faith
in
their
painted
as
if
among
the
forms
of
gods
the
economist
of
who
asks
of
what
use
are
the
lords
may
learn
of
franklin
to
ask
of
what
use
is
a
baby
they
have
been
a
social
church
proper
to
inspire
sentiments
mutually
honoring
the
lover
and
the
loved
politeness
is
the
ritual
of
society
as
prayers
are
of
the
church
a
school
of
manners
and
a
gentle
blessing
to
the
age
in
which
it
grew
t
is
a
romance
adorning
english
life
with
a
larger
horizon
a
midway
heaven
fulfilling
to
their
sense
their
fairy
tales
and
poetry
this
just
as
far
as
the
breeding
of
the
nobleman
really
made
him
brave
handsome
accomplished
and
on
general
grounds
whatever
tends
to
form
manners
or
to
finish
men
has
a
great
value
every
one
who
has
tasted
the
delight
of
friendship
will
respect
every
social
guard
which
our
manners
can
establish
tending
to
secure
from
the
intrusion
of
frivolous
and
distasteful
people
the
jealousy
of
every
class
to
guard
itself
is
a
testimony
to
the
reality
they
have
found
in
life
when
a
man
once
knows
that
he
has
done
justice
to
himself
let
him
dismiss
all
terrors
of
aristocracy
as
superstitions
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
he
who
keeps
the
door
of
a
mine
whether
of
cobalt
or
mercury
or
nickel
or
plumbago
securely
knows
that
the
world
can
not
do
without
him
everybody
who
is
real
is
open
and
ready
for
that
which
is
also
real
besides
these
are
they
who
make
england
that
strongbox
and
museum
it
is
who
gather
and
protect
works
of
art
dragged
from
amidst
burning
cities
and
revolutionary
countries
and
brought

of

war
is
a
foul
game
and
yet
war
is
not
the
worst
part
of
aristocratic
history
in
later
times
when
the
baron
educated
only
for
war
with
his
brains
paralyzed
by
his

found
himself
idle
at

the
young

uppermost
the
old
serious
lords
were
out
of

the
discourse
that
the

companions
had
with
him
was
poor
and
frothy
no
man
who
valued
his

might
do
what

did
with

sequence
of

pepys

tell
the
beggarly
shifts
to
which
the

was
reduced
who
could
not
find
paper
at
his
council
table
and
no
handkerchers
in
his
wardrobe
and
but
three
bands

the

correspondence
in
the
reign
of

discloses
a
rottenness
in
the

which
threatened

decompose

the
sycophancy
and
sale
of

and
honor
for

lewdness
gaming
smuggling
bribery

the

at

indiscretion
of

with

thousand
a

the
want
of

the
splendor
of

and
the
apathy
of
the

are
instructive
and
make
the
reader
pause
and
explore
the
firm
bounds
which
confined
these
vices
to
a
handful
of
rich
men
in
the
reign
of

george
things
do
not

and
the
rotten
debauchee
let
down
from

window
by
an
inclined
plane
into
his
coach
to
take
the
air
was
a
scandal
to
europe
which
the
ill
fame
of
his
queen
and
of
his
family
did
nothing
to
retrieve
under
the
present
reign
the
perfect
decorum
of
the
court
is
thought
to
have
put
a
check
on
the
gross
vices
of
the
aristocracy
yet
gaming
racing
drinking
and
mistresses
bring
them
down
and
the

can
still
gather
scandals
if
he

dismal

of

even
peers
who
are
men
of

and

overtaken

the
respectable
duke
of

willing
to
be
the
mec√¶nas
and
lucullus
of
his
island
is
reported
to
have
said
that
he
can
not
live
at
chatsworth
but
one
month
in
the
year
their
many
houses
eat
them
up
they
can
not
sell
them
because
they
are
entailed
they
will
not
let
them
for
pride
s
sake
but
keep
them
empty
aired
and
the
grounds
mown
and
dressed
at
a
cost
of
four
or
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
the
spending
is
for
a
great
part
in
servants
in
many
houses
exceeding
a
hundred
most
of
them
are
only
chargeable
with
idleness
which
because
it
squanders
such
vast
power
of
benefit
has
the
mischief
of
crime
they
might
be
little
providences
on
earth
said
my
friend
and
they
are
for
the
most
part
jockeys
and
fops
campbell
says
acquaintance
with
the
nobility
i
could
never
keep
up
it
requires
a
life
of
idleness
dressing
and
attendance
on
their
parties
i
suppose
too
that
a
feeling
of
is
driving
cultivated
men
out
of
this
society
as
if
the
noble
were
slow
to
receive
the
lessons
of
the
times
and
had
not
learned
to
disguise
his
pride
of
place
a
man
of
wit
who
is
also
one
of
the
celebrities
of
wealth
and
fashion
confessed
to
his
friend
that
he
could
not
enter
their
houses
without
being
made
to
feel
that
they
were
great
lords
and
he
a
low
plebeian
with
the
tribe
of
including
the
musical
tribe
the
patrician
morgue
keeps
no
terms
but
excludes
them
when
julia
grisi
and
mario
sang
at
the
houses
of
the
duke
of
wellington
and
other
grandees
a
ribbon
was
stretched
between
the
singer
and
the
company
when
every
noble
was
a
soldier
they
were
carefully
bred
to
great
personal
prowess
the
education
of
a
soldier
is
a
simpler
affair
than
that
of
an
earl
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
this
was
very
seriously
pursued
they
were
expert
in
every
species
of
equitation
to
the
most
dangerous
practices
and
this
down
to
the
accession
of
william
of
orange
but
graver
men
appear
to
have
trained
their
sons
for
civil
affairs
elizabeth
extended
her
thought
to
the
future
and
sir
philip
sidney
in
his
letter
to
his
brother
and
milton
and
evelyn
gave
plain
and
hearty
counsel
already
too

were
preparing
for

went
from

learning
receipts
to
make
perfumes
sweet
powders
pomanders
antidotes
gathering
seeds
gems
coins
and
divers
curiosities
preparing
for
a
private
life
thereafter
in
which
they
should
take
pleasure
in
these
recreations
all
advantages
given
to
absolve
the
young
patrician
from
intellectual
labor
are
of
course
mistaken
in
the
university
noblemen
are
exempted
from
the
public
exercises
for
the
degree
by
which
they
attain
a
degree
called
honorary
at
the
same
time
the
fees
they
must
pay
for
matriculation
and
on
all
other
occasions
are
much
higher
fuller
records
the
observation
of
foreigners
that
englishmen
by
making
their
children
gentlemen
before
they
are
men
cause
they
are
so
seldom
wise
men
this
cockering
justifies
johnson

bitter
apology
for
primogeniture
that
it
makes

namely
steam
ships
printing
money
and
popular
education
belong
to
those
who
can
handle
them
and
their
effect
has
been
that
advantages
once
confined
to
men
of
family
are
now
open
to
the
whole
middle
class
the
road
that
grandeur
levels
for
his
coach
toil
can
travel
in
his
cart
this
is
more
manifest
every
day
but
i
think
it
is
true
throughout
english
history
english
history
wisely
read
is
the
vindication
of
the
brain
of
that
people
here
at
last
were
climate
and
condition
friendly
to
the
working
faculty
who
now
will
work
and
dare
shall
rule
this
is
the
charter
or
the
chartism
which
fogs
and
seas
and
rains
proclaimed
that
intellect
and
personal
force
should
make
the
law
that
industry
and
administrative
talent
should
administer
that
work
should
wear
the
crown
i
know
that
not
this
but
something
else
is
pretended
the
fiction
with
which
the
noble
and
the
bystander
equally
please
themselves
is
that
the
former
is
of
unbroken
descent
from
the
norman
and
so
has
never
worked
for
eight
hundred
years
all
the
families
are
new
but
the
name
is
old
and
they
have
made
a
covenant
with
their
memories
not
to
disturb
it
but
the
analysis
of
the
peerage
and
gentry
shows
the
rapid
decay
and
extinction
of
old
families
the
continual
recruiting
of
these
from
new
blood
the
doors
though
ostentatiously
guarded
are
really
open
and
hence
the
power
of
the
bribe
all
the
barriers
to
rank
only
whet
the
thirst
and
enhance
the
prize
now
said
nelson
when
clearing
for
battle
a
peerage
or
westminster
abbey
i
have
no
illusion
left
said
sidney
smith
but
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
the
lawyers
said
burke
are
only
birds
of
passage
in
this
house
of
commons
and
then
added
with
a
new
figure
they
have
their
best
bower
anchor
in
the
house
of
lords
another
stride
that
has
been
taken
appears
in
the
perishing
of
heraldry
whilst
the
privileges
of
nobility
are
passing
to
the
middle
class
the
badge
is
discredited
and
the
titles
of
lordship
are
getting
musty
and
cumbersome
i
wonder
that
sensible
men
have
not
been
already
impatient
of
them
they
belong
with
wigs
powder
and
scarlet
coats
to
an
earlier
age
and
may
be
advantageously
consigned
with
paint
and
tattoo
to
the
dignitaries
of
australia
and
polynesia
a
multitude
of
english
educated
at
the
universities
bred
into
their
society
with
manners
ability
and
the
gifts
of
fortune
are
every
day
confronting
the
peers
on
a
footing
of
equality
and
outstripping
them
as
often
in
the
race
of
honor
and
influence
that
cultivated
class
is
large
and
ever
enlarging
it
is
computed
that
with
titles
and
without
there
are
seventy
thousand
of
these
people
coming
and
going
in
london
who
make
up
what
is
called
high
society
they
can
not
shut
their
eyes
to
the
fact
that
an
untitled
nobility
possess
all
the
power
without
the
inconveniences
that
belong
to
rank
and
the
rich
englishman
goes
over
the
world
at
the
present
day
drawing
more
than
all
the
advantages
which
the
strongest
of
his
kings
could
command

cambridge

the
most
illustrious

on
its
list
at
the
present
day
too
it
has
the
advantage
of
oxford
counting
in
its
a
greater
number
of
distinguished
scholars
i
regret
that
i
had
but
a
single
day
wherein
to
see
king
s
college
chapel
the
beautiful
lawns
and
gardens
of
the
colleges
and
a
few
of
its
gownsmen
but
i
availed
myself
of
some
repeated
invitations
to
oxford
where
i
had
introductions
to
daubeny
professor
of
botany
and
to
the
regius
professor
of
divinity
as
well
as
to
a
valued
friend
a
fellow
of

and
went
thither
on
the
last
day
of
march
i
was
the
guest
of
my
friend
in
oriel
was
housed
close
upon
that
college
and
i
lived
on
college
hospitalities
my
new
friends
showed
me
their
cloisters
the
bodleian
library
the
randolph
gallery
merton
hall
and
the
rest
i
saw
several
faithful
young
men
some
of
them
in
the
mood
of
making
sacrifices
for
peace
of
mind
a
topic
of
course
on
which
i
had
no
counsel
to
offer
their
affectionate
and
gregarious
ways
reminded
me
at
once
of
the
habits
of
cambridge
men
though
i
imputed
to
these
english
an
advantage
in
their
secure
and
polished
manners
the

are
rich
with
oaken
wainscoting
and
ceiling
the
pictures
of
the

hang
from
the

glitter
with

a
youth
came
forward
to
the
upper

and
pronounced
the
ancient
form
of
grace
before
meals
which
i
suppose
has
been
in
use
here
for
ages
benedicat

it
is
a
curious
proof
of
the
english
use
and
wont
or
of
their
that
these
young
men
are
locked
up
every
night
at
nine
o
clock
and
the
porter
at
each
hall
is
required
to
give
the
name
of
any
belated
student
who
is
admitted
after
that
hour
still
more
descriptive
is
the
fact
that
out
of
twelve
hundred
young
men
comprising
the
most
spirited
of
the
aristocracy
a
duel
has
never
occurred
oxford
is
old
even

of

are
continually
accruing
in
the
course
of
a
century
my
friend
doctor
gave
me
the
following
anecdote
in
sir
thomas
lawrence
s
collection
at
london
were
the
cartoons
of
raphael
and
michel
angelo
this
inestimable
prize
was
offered
to
oxford
university
for
seven
thousand
pounds
the
offer
was
accepted
and
the
committee
charged
with
the
affair
had
collected
three
thousand
pounds
when
among
other
friends
they
called
on
lord
eldon
instead
of
a
hundred
pounds
he
surprised
them
by
putting
down
his
name
for
three
thousand
pounds
they
told
him
they
should
now
very
easily
raise
the
remainder
no
he
said
your
men
have
probably
already
contributed
all
they
can
spare
i
can
as
well
give
the
rest
and
he
withdrew
his
check
for
three
thousand
and
wrote
four
thousand
pounds
i
saw
the
whole
collection
in
april
in
the
bodleian
library
bandinel
showed
me
the
manuscript
plato
of
the
date
of
brought
by
clarke
from
egypt
a
manuscript
virgil
of
the
same
century
the
first
bible
printed
at
mentz
i
believe
in
and
a
duplicate
of
the
same
which
had
been
deficient
in
about
twenty
leaves
at
the
end
but
one
day
being
in
venice
he
bought
a
room
full
of
books
and
manuscripts
every
scrap
and
fragment
for
four
thousand
louis
d
ors
and
had
the
doors
locked
and
sealed
by
the
consul
on
proceeding
afterwards
to
examine
his
purchase
he
found
the
twenty
deficient
pages
of
his
mentz
bible
in
perfect
order
brought
them
to
oxford
with
the
rest
of
his
purchase
and
placed
them
in
the
volume
but
has
too
much
awe
for
the
providence
that
appears
in
bibliography
also
to
suffer
the
reunited
parts
to
be
rebound
the
oldest
building
here
is
two
hundred
years
younger
than
the
frail
manuscript
brought
by
clarke
from

no
candle
or

its
catalogue
is
the

catalogue
on
the

in

in
each
several
college
they
underscore
in

on

the
titles
of

the

says
professor
sewel
of

tuition
at

is
about
sixteen
guineas
a

but
this
plausible
statement
may
deceive
a
reader
unacquainted
with
the
fact
that
the
principal
teaching
relied
on
is
private
tuition
and
the
expenses
of
private
tuition
are
reckoned
at
from
to
a

or
for
the
whole
course
of

the
number
of

the
dignity
of

the
value
of
the
foundations
the
history
and
the

the
known
sympathy
of
entire
britain
in
what
is
done

justify
a
dedication
to
study
in
the
undergraduate
such
as
can
not
easily
be
in
america
where
his
college
is
half
suspected
by
the
freshman
to
be
insignificant
in
the
scale
beside
trade
and
politics
oxford
is
a
little
aristocracy
in
itself
numerous
and
dignified
enough
to
rank
with
other
estates
in
the
realm
and
where
fame
and
secular
promotion
are
to
be
had
for
study
and
in
a
direction
which
has
the
unanimous
respect
of
all
cultivated
nations
this
aristocracy
of
course
repairs
its
own
losses
fills
places
as
they
fall
vacant
from
the
body
of
students
the
number
of
fellowships
at
oxford
is
averaging
a
year
with
lodging
and
diet
at
the
college
if
a
young
american
loving
learning
and
hindered
by
poverty
were
offered
a
home
a
table
the
walks
and
the
library
in
one
of
these
academical
palaces
and
a
thousand
dollars
a
year
as
long
as
he
chose
to
remain
a
bachelor
he
would
dance
for
joy
yet
these
young
men
thus
happily
placed
and
paid
to
read
are
impatient
of
their
few
checks
and
many
of
them
preparing
to
resign
their
fellowships
they
shuddered
at
the
prospect
of
dying
a
fellow
and
they
pointed
out
to
me
a
paralytic
old
man
who
was
assisted
into
the
hall
as
the
number
of
undergraduates
at
oxford
is
only
about
or
and
many
of
these
are
never
competitors
the
chance
of
a
fellowship
is
very
great
the
income
of
the
nineteen
colleges
is
conjectured
at
a
year
the
effect
of
this
drill
is
the
radical
knowledge
of
greek
and
latin
and
of
mathematics
and
the
solidity
and
taste
of
english
criticism
whatever
luck
there
may
be
in
this
or
that
award
an
eton
captain
can
write
latin
longs
and
shorts
can
turn
the
into
hexameters
and
it
is
certain
that
a
senior
classic
can
quote
correctly
from
the
and
is
critically
learned
in
all
the
humanities
greek
erudition
exists
on
the
isis
and
cam
whether
the
maud
man
or
the
brazen
nose
man
be
properly
ranked
or
not
the
atmosphere
is
loaded
with
greek
learning
the
whole
river
has
reached
a
certain
height
and
kills
all
that
growth
of
weeds
which
this
castalian
water
kills
the
english
nature
takes
culture
kindly
so
milton
thought
it
refines
the
norseman
access
to
the
greek
mind
lifts
his
standard
of
taste
he
has
enough
to
think
of
and
unless
of
an
impulsive
nature
is
indisposed
from
writing
or
speaking
by
the
fulness
of
his
mind
and
the
new
severity
of
his
taste
the
great
silent
crowd
of
grecians
always
known
to
be
around
him
the
english
writer
can
not
ignore
they
prune
his
orations
and
point
his
pen
hence
the
style
and
tone
of
english
journalism
the
men
have
learned
accuracy
and
comprehension
logic
and
pace
or
speed
of
working
they
have
bottom
endurance
wind
when
born
with
good
constitutions
they
make
those
eupeptic
the
men
the
whose
powers
of
performance
compare
with
ours
as
the
with
the
cokes
mansfields
seldens
and
bentleys
and
when
it
happens
that
a
superior
brain
puts
a
rider
on
this
admirable
horse
we
obtain
those
masters
of
the
world
who
combine
the
highest
energy
in
affairs
with
a
supreme
culture
it
is
contended
by
those
who
have
been
bred
at
eton
harrow
rugby
and
westminster
that
the
public
sentiment
within
each
of
those
schools
is
and
manly
that
in
their
playgrounds
courage
is
universally
admired
meanness
despised
manly
feelings
and
generous
conduct
are
encouraged
that
an
unwritten
code
of
honor
deals
to
the
spoiled
child
of
rank
and
to
the
child
of
upstart
wealth
an
justice
purges
their
nonsense
out
of
both
and
does
all
that
can
be
done
to
make
them
gentlemen
again
at
the
universities
it
is
urged
that
all
goes
to
form
what
england
values
as
the
flower
of
its
national
life
a
gentleman
the
german
huber
in
describing
to
his
countrymen
the
attributes
of
an
english
gentleman
frankly
admits
that
in
germany
we
have
nothing
of
the
kind
a
gentleman
must
possess
a
political
character
an
independent
and
public
position
or
at
least
the
right
of
assuming
it
he
must
have
average
opulence
either
of
his
own
or
in
his
family
he
should
also
have
bodily
activity
and
strength
unattainable
by
our
sedentary
life
in
public
offices
the
race
of
english
gentlemen
presents
an
appearance
of
manly
vigor
and
form
not
elsewhere
to
be
found
among
an
equal
number
of
persons
no
other
nation
produces
the
stock
and
in
england
it
has
deteriorated
the
university
is
a
decided
presumption
in
any
man
s
favor
and
so
eminent
are
the
members
that
a
glance
at
the
calendars
will
show
that
in
all
the
world
one
can
not
be
in
better
company
than
on

a
school
which
excludes
all
that
could
fit
a
man
for
standing
behind
a
counter
see
bristed
five
years
in
an
english
university
new
york
no
doubt
the
foundations
have
been
perverted
oxford
which
equals
in
wealth
several
of
the
smaller
european
states
shuts
up
the
lectureships
which
were
made
public
for
all
men
thereunto
to
have
concourse
misspends
the
revenues
bestowed
for
such
youths
as
should
be
most
meet
for
towardness
poverty
and
painfulness
there
is
gross
favoritism
many
chairs
and
many
fellowships
are
made
beds
of
ease
and
tis
likely
that
the
university
will
know
how
to
resist
and
make
inoperative
the
terrors
of
parliamentary
inquiry
no
doubt
their
learning
is
grown
obsolete
but
oxford
also
has
its
merits
and
i
found
here
also
proof
of
the
national
fidelity
and
thoroughness
such
knowledge
as
they
prize
they
possess
and
impart
whether
in
course
or
by
indirection
whether
by
a
cramming
tutor
or
by
examiners
with
prizes
and
foundation
scholarships
education
according
to
the
english
notion
of
it
is
acquired
i
looked
over
the
examination
papers
of
the
year
for
the
various
scholarships
and
fellowships
the
lusby
the
hertford
the
and
the
university
copies
of
which
were
kindly
given
me
by
a
greek
professor
containing
the
tasks
which
many
competitors
had
victoriously
performed
and
i
believed
they
would
prove
too
severe
tests
for
the
candidates
for
a
bachelor
s
degree
in
yale
or
harvard
and
in
general
here
was
proof
of
a
more
searching
study
in
the
appointed
directions
and
the
knowledge
pretended
to
be
conveyed
was
conveyed
oxford
sends
out
yearly
twenty
or
thirty
very
able
men
and
three
or
four
hundred
men
the
diet
and
rough
exercise
secure
a
certain
amount
of
old
norse
power
a
fop
will
fight
and
in
exigent
circumstances
will
play
the
manly
part
in
seeing
these
youths
i
believed
i
saw
already
an
advantage
in
vigor
and
color
and
general
habit
over
their
contemporaries
in
the
american
colleges
no
doubt
much
of
the
power
and
brilliancy
of
the
is
merely
constitutional
or
hygienic
with
a
hardier
habit
and
resolute
gymnastics
with
five
miles
more
walking
or
five
ounces
less
eating
or
with
a
saddle
and
gallop
of
twenty
miles
a
day
with
skating
and
rowing
matches
the
american
would
arrive
at
as
robust
exegesis
and
cheery
and
hilarious
tone
i
should
readily
concede
these
advantages
which
it
would
be
easy
to
acquire
if
i
did
not
find
also
that
they
read
better
than
we
and
write
better
english
wealth
falling
on
their
school
and
university
training
makes
a
systematic
reading
of
the
best
authors
and
to
the
end
of
a
knowledge
how
the
things
whereof
they
treat
really
stand
whilst
pamphleteer
or
journalist
reading
for
an
argument
for
a
party
or
reading
to
write
or
at
all
events
for
some
by
end
imposed
on
them
must
read
meanly
and
fragmentarily
charles
said
that
he
understood
english
law
as
well
as
a
gentleman
ought
to
understand
it
then
they
have
access
to
books
the
rich
libraries
collected
at
every
one
of
many
thousands
of
houses
give
an
advantage
not
to
be
attained
by
a
youth
in
this
country
when
one
thinks
how
much
more
and
better
may
be
learned
by
a
scholar
who
immediately
on
hearing
of
a
book
can
consult
it
than
by
one
who
is
on
the
quest
for
years
and
reads
inferior
books
because
he
can
not
find
the
best
again
the
great
number
of
cultivated
men
keep
each
other
up
to
a
high
standard
the
habit
of
meeting
and
knowing
men
teaches
the
art
of
omission
and
selection
universities
are
of
course
hostile
to
geniuses
which
seeing
and
using
ways
of
their
own
discredit
the
routine
as
churches
and
monasteries
persecute
youthful
saints
yet
we
all
send
our
sons
to
college
and
though
he
be
a
genius
he
must
take
his
chance
the
university
must
be
retrospective
the
gale
that
gives
direction
to
the
vanes
on
all
its
towers
blows
out
of
antiquity
oxford
is
a
library
and
the
professors
must
be
librarians
and
i
should
as
soon
think
of
quarrelling
with
the
janitor
for
not
magnifying
his
office
by
hostile
sallies
into
the
street
like
the
governor
of
kertch
or
kinburn
as
of
quarrelling
with
the
professors
for
not
admiring
the
young
neologists
who
pluck
the
beards
of
euclid
and
aristotle
or
for
not
attempting
themselves
to
fill
their
vacant
shelves
as
original
writers
it
is
easy
to
carp
at
colleges
and
the
college
if
we
will
wait
for
it
will
have
its
own
turn
genius
exists
there
also
but
will
not
answer
a
call
of
a
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
it
is
rare
precarious
eccentric
and
darkling
england
is
the
land
of
mixture
and
surprise
and
when
you
have
settled
it
that
the
universities
are
moribund
out
comes
a
poetic
influence
from
the
heart
of
oxford
to
mould
the
opinions
of
cities
to
build
their
houses
as
simply
as
birds
their
nests
to
give
veracity
to
art
and
charm
mankind
as
an
appeal
to
moral
order
always
must
but
besides
this
restorative
genius
the
best
poetry
of
england
of
this
age
in
the
old
forms
comes
from
two
graduates
of
cambridge
chapter
religion
no
people
at
the
present
day
can
be
explained
by
their
national
religion
they
do
not
feel
responsible
for
it
it
lies
far
outside
of
them
their
loyalty
to
truth
and
their
labor
and
expenditure
rest
on
real
foundations
and
not
on
a
national
church
and
english
life
it
is
evident
does
not
grow
out
of
the
athanasian
creed
or
the
articles
or
the
eucharist
it
is
with
religion
as
with
marriage
a
youth
marries
in
haste
afterwards
when
his
mind
is
opened
to
the
reason
of
the
conduct
of
life
he
is
asked
what
he
thinks
of
the
institution
of
marriage
and
of
the
right
relations
of
the
sexes
i
should
have
much
to
say
he
might
reply
if
the
question
were
open
but
i
have
a
wife
and
children
and
all
question
is
closed
for
in
the
barbarous
days
of
a
nation
some
cultus
is
formed
or
imported
altars
are
built
tithes
are
paid
priests
ordained
the
education
and
expenditure
of
the
country
take
that
direction
and
when
wealth
refinement
great
men
and
ties
to
the
world
supervene
its
prudent
men
say
why
fight
against
fate
or
lift
these
absurdities
which
are
now
mountainous
better
find
some
niche
or
crevice
in
this
mountain
of
stone
which
religious
ages
have
quarried
and
carved
wherein
to
bestow
yourself
than
attempt
anything
ridiculously
and
dangerously
above
your
strength
like
removing
it
in
seeing
old
castles
and
cathedrals
i
sometimes
say
as
in

of

which
is
eight
hundred
years
old
this
was
built
by
another
and
a
better
race
than
any
that
now
look
on
and
plainly
there
has
been
great
power
of
sentiment
at
work
in
this
island
of
which
these
buildings
are
the
proofs
as
volcanic
basalts
show
the
work
of
fire
which
has
been
extinguished
for

england
felt
the
full
heat
of
the
christianity
which
fermented
europe
and
drew
like
the
chemistry
of

firm
line
between
barbarism

has
made
in
fourteen
centuries
a
massive
system
close
fitted
to
the
manners
and
genius
of
the

at
once
domestical
and
stately
in

long

it

blended

through

every

all

hence
its

enforces
a

nothing

much

the

its

made

eye
then
when
the
saxon
instinct
had
secured
a
service
in
the
vernacular
tongue
it
was
the
tutor
and
university
of
the
people
in
york
minster
on
the
day
of
the
enthronization
of
the
new
archbishop
i
heard
the
service
of
evening
prayer
read
and
chanted
in
the
choir
it
was
strange
to
hear
the
pretty
pastoral
of
the
betrothal
of
rebecca
and
isaac
in
the
morning
of
the
world
read
with
circumstantiality
in

minster
on

to
the
decorous
english
audience
just
fresh
from
the
times
newspaper
and
their
wine
and
listening
with
all
the
devotion
of
national
pride
that
was
binding
old
and
new
to
some
purpose
the
reverence
for
the
scriptures
is
an
element
of
civilization
for
thus
has
the
history
of
the
world
been
preserved
and
is
preserved
here
in
england
every
day
a
chapter
of
genesis
and
a
leader
in
the
times
another
part
of
the
same
service
on
this
occasion
was
not
insignificant
handel
s
coronation
anthem
save
the
was
played
by
camidge
on
the
organ
with
sublime
effect
the
minster
and
the
music
were
made
for
each
other
it
was
a
hint
of
the
part
the
church
plays
as
a
political
engine
from
his
infancy
every
englishman
is
accustomed
to
hear
daily
prayers
for
the
queen
for
the
royal
family
and
the
parliament
by
name
and
this
lifelong
consecration
of
these
personages
can
not
be
without
influence
on
his
opinions
the
universities
also
are
parcel
of
the
ecclesiastical
system
and
their
first
design
is
to
form
the
clergy
thus
the
clergy
for
a
thousand
years
have
been
the
scholars
of
the
nation
the
national
temperament
deeply
enjoys
the
unbroken
order
and
tradition
of
its
church
the
liturgy
ceremony
architecture
the
sober
grace
the
good
company
the
connection
with
the
throne
and
with
history
which
adorn
it
and
whilst
it
endears
itself
thus
to
men
of
more
taste
than
activity
the
stability
of
the
english
nation
is
passionately
enlisted
to
its
support
from
its
inextricable
connection
with
the
cause
of
public
order
with
politics
and
with
the
funds
good
churches
are
not
built
by
bad
men
at
least
there
must
be
probity
and
enthusiasm
somewhere
in
society
these
minsters
were
neither
built
nor
filled
by
atheists
no
church
has
had
more
learned
industrious
or
devoted
men
plenty
of
clerks
and
bishops
who
out
of
their
gowns
would
turn
their
backs
on
no
man
their
architecture
still
glows
with
faith
in
immortality
heats
and
genial
periods
arrive
in
history
or
shall
we
say
plenitudes
of
divine
presence
by
which
high
tides
are
caused
in
the
human
spirit
and
great
virtues
and
talents
appear
as
in
the
eleventh
twelfth
thirteenth
and
again
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
when
the
nation
was
full
of
genius
and
piety
fuller
but
the
age
of
the
wicliffes
cobhams
arundels
beckets
of
the
latimers
mores
cranmers
of
the
taylors
leightons
herberts
of
the
sherlocks
and
butlers
is
gone
silent
revolutions
in
opinion
have
made
it
impossible
that
men
like
these
should
return
or
find
a
place
in
their
once
sacred
stalls
the
spirit
that
dwelt
in
this
church
has
glided
away
to
animate
other
activities
and
they
who
come
to
the
old
shrines
find
apes
and
players
rustling
the
old
garments
the
religion
of
england
is
part
of
good
breeding
when
you
see
on
the
continent
the
englishman
come
into
his
ambassador
s
chapel
and
put
his
face
for
silent
prayer
into
his
hat
one
can
not
help
feeling
how
much
national
pride
prays
with
him
and
the
religion
of
a
gentleman
so
far
is
he
from
attaching
any
meaning
to
the
words
that
he
believes
himself
to
have
done
almost
the
generous
thing
and
that
it
is
very
condescending
in
him
to
pray
to
god
a
great
duke
said
on
the
occasion
of
a
victory
in
the
house
of
lords
that
he
thought
the
almighty
god
had
not
been
well
used
by
them
and
that
it
would
become
their
magnanimity
after
so
great
successes
to
take
order
that
a
proper
acknowledgment
be
made
it
is
the
church
of
the
gentry
but
it
is
not
the
church
of
the
poor
the
operatives
do
not
own
it
and
gentlemen
lately
testified
in
the
house
of
commons
that
in
their
lives
they
never
saw
a
poor
man
in
a
ragged
coat
inside
a
church
the
torpidity
on
the
side
of
religion
of
the
vigorous
english
understanding
shows
how
much
wit
and
folly
can
agree
in
one
brain
their
religion
is
a
quotation
their
church
is
a
doll
and
any
examination
is
interdicted
with
screams
of
terror
in
good
company
you
expect
them
to
laugh
at
the
fanaticism
of
the
vulgar
but
they
do
not
they
are
the
vulgar
the
english
in
common
perhaps
with
christendom
in
the
nineteenth
century
do
not
respect
power
but
only
performance
value
ideas
only
for
an
economic
result
wellington
esteems
a
saint
only
as
far
as
he
can
be

army
chaplain
briscoll
by
his
admirable
conduct
and
good
sense
got
the
better
of
methodism
which
had
appeared
among
the
soldiers
and
once
among
the
officers
they
value
a
philosopher
as
they
value
an
apothecary
who
brings
bark
or
a
drench
and
inspiration
is
only
some
blowpipe
or
a
finer
mechanical
aid
i
suspect
that
there
is
in
an
englishman
s
brain
a
valve
that
can
be
closed
at
pleasure
as
an
engineer
shuts
off
steam
the
most
sensible
and
men
possess
the
power
of
thinking
just
so
far
as
the
bishop
in
religious
matters
and
as
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
in
politics
they
talk
with
courage
and
logic
and
show
you
magnificent
results
but
the
same
men
who
have
brought
or
geology
to
their
present
standing
look
grave
and
lofty
and
shut
down
their
valve
as
soon
as
the
conversation
approaches
the
english
church
after
that
you
talk
with
a
the
action
of
the
university
both
in
what
is
taught
and
in
the
spirit
of
the
place
is
directed
more
on
producing
an
english
gentleman
than
a
saint
or
a
psychologist
it
ripens
a
bishop
and
extrudes
a
philosopher
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
more
cabalism
in
the
anglican
than
in
other
churches
but
the
anglican
clergy
are
identified
with
the
aristocracy
they
say
here
that
if
you
talk
with
a
clergyman
you
are
sure
to
find
him
well
bred
informed
and
candid
he
entertains
your
thought
or
your
project
with
sympathy
and
praise
but
if
a
second
clergyman
come
in
the
sympathy
is
at
an
end
two
together
are
inaccessible
to
your
thought
and
whenever
it
comes
to
action
the
clergyman
invariably
sides
with
his
church
the
anglican
church
is
marked
by
the
grace
and
good
sense
of
its
forms
by
the
manly
grace
of
its
clergy
the
gospel
it
preaches
is
by
taste
are
ye
it
keeps
the
old
structures
in
repair
spends
a
world
of
money
in
music
and
building
and
in
buying
pugin
and
architectural
literature
it
has
a
general
good
name
for
amenity
and
mildness
it
is
not
in
ordinary
a
persecuting
church
it
is
not
inquisitorial
not
even
inquisitive
is
perfectly
well
bred
and
can
shut
its
eyes
on
all
proper
occasions
if
you
let
it
alone
it
will
let
you
alone
but
its
instinct
is
hostile
to
all
change
in
politics
literature
or
social
arts
the
church
has
not
been
the
founder
of
the
london
university
of
the
mechanics
institutes
of
the
free
school
or
whatever
aims
at
diffusion
of
knowledge
the
platonists
of
oxford
are
as
bitter
against
this
heresy
as
thomas
taylor
the
doctrine
of
the
old
testament
is
the
religion
of
england
the
first
leaf
of
the
new
testament
it
does
not
open
it
believes
in
a
providence
which
does
not
treat
with
levity
a
pound
sterling
they
are
neither
transcendentalists
nor
christians
they
put
up
no
socratic
prayer
much
less
any
saintly
prayer
for
the
queen
s
mind
ask
neither
for
light
nor
right
but
say
bluntly
grant
her
in
health
and
wealth
long
to
live
and
one
traces
this
jewish
prayer
in
all
english
private
history
from
the
prayers
of
king
richard
in
richard
of
devizes
chronicle
to
those
in
the
diaries
of
sir
samuel
romilly
and
of
haydon
the
painter
abroad
with
my
wife
writes
pepys
piously
the
first
time
that
ever
i
rode
in
my
own
coach
which
do
make
my
heart
rejoice
and
praise
god
and
pray
him
to
bless
it
to
me
and
continue
it
the
bill
for
the
naturalization
of
the
jews
in
was
resisted
by
petitions
from
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
and
by
petition
from
the
city
of
london
reprobating
this
bill
as
tending
extremely
to
the
dishonor
of
the
christian
religion
and
extremely
injurious
to
the
interests
and
commerce
of
the
kingdom
in
general
and
of
the
city
of
london
in
particular
but
they
have
not
been
able
to
congeal
humanity
by
act
of
parliament
the
heavens
journey
still
and
sojourn
not
and
arts
wars
discoveries
and
opinion
go
onward
at
their
own
pace
the
new
age
has
new
desires
new
enemies
new
trades
new
charities
and
reads
the
scriptures
with
new
eyes
the
chatter
of
french
politics
the
the
hum
of
the
mill
and
the
noise
of
embarking
emigrants
had
quite
put
most
of
the
old
legends
out
of
mind
so
that
when
you
came
to
read
the
liturgy
to
a
modern
congregation
it
was
almost
absurd
in
its
unfitness
and
suggested
a
masquerade
of
old
costumes
no
chemist
has
prospered
in
the
attempt
to
crystallize
a
religion
it
is
endogenous
like
the
skin
and
other
vital
organs
a
new
statement
every
day
the
prophet
and
apostle
knew
this
and
the
confutes
the
conformists
by
quoting
the
texts
they
must
allow
it
is
the
condition
of
a
religion
to
require
religion
for
its
expositor
prophet
and
apostle
can
only
be
rightly
understood
by
prophet
and
apostle
the
statesman
knows
that
the
religious
element
will
not
fail
any
more
than
the
supply
of
fibrine
and
chyle
but
it
is
in
its
nature
constructive
and
will
organize
such
a
church
as
it
wants
the
wise
legislator
will
spend
on
temples
schools
libraries
colleges
but
will
shun
the
enriching
of
priests
if
in
any
manner
he
can
leave
the
election
and
paying
of
the
priest
to
the
people
he
will
do
well
like
the
quakers
he
may
resist
the
separation
of
a
class
of
priests
and
create
opportunity
and
expectation
in
the
society
to
run
to
meet
natural
endowment
in
this
kind
but
when
wealth
accrues
to
a
chaplaincy
a
bishopric
or
rectorship
it
requires
moneyed
men
for
its
stewards
who
will
give
it
another
direction
than
to
the
mystics
of
their
day
of
course
money
will
do
after
its
kind
and
will
steadily
work
to
unspiritualize
and
unchurch
the
people
to
whom
it
was
bequeathed
the
class
certain
to
be
excluded
from
all
preferment
are
the
religious
and
driven
to
other
churches
which
is
nature
s
the
curates
are
ill
paid
and
the
prelates
are
overpaid
this
abuse
draws
into
the
church
the
children
of
the
nobility
and
other
unfit
persons
who
have
a
taste
for
expense
thus
a
bishop
is
only
a
surpliced
merchant
through
his
lawn
i
can
see
the
bright
buttons
of
the
shopman
s
coat
glitter
a
wealth
like
that
of
durham
makes
almost
a
premium
on
felony
brougham
in
a
speech
in
the
house
of
commons
on
the
irish
elective
franchise
said
how
will
the
reverend
bishops
of
the
other
house
be
able
to
express
their
due
abhorrence
of
the
crime
of
perjury
who
solemnly
declare
in
the
presence
of
god
that
when
they
are
called
upon
to
accept
a
living
perhaps
of
a
year
at
that
very
instant
they
are
moved
by
the
holy
ghost
to
accept
the
office
and
administration
thereof
and
for
no
other
reason
whatever
the
modes
of
initiation
are
more
damaging
than
oaths
the
bishop
is
elected
by
the
dean
and
prebends
of
the
cathedral
the
queen
sends
these
gentlemen
a
d
or
leave
to
elect
but
also
sends
them
the
name
of
the
person
whom
they
are
to
elect
they
go
into
the
cathedral
chant
and
pray
and
beseech
the
holy
ghost
to
assist
them
in
their
choice
and
after
these
invocations
invariably
find
that
the
dictates
of
the
holy
ghost
agree
with
the
recommendations
of
the
queen
but
you
must
pay
for
conformity
all
goes
well
as
long
as
you
run
with
conformists
but
you
who
are
an
honest
man
in
other
particulars
know
that
there
is
alive
somewhere
a
man
whose
honesty
reaches
to
this
point
also
that
he
shall
not
kneel
to
false
gods
and
on
the
day
when
you
meet
him
you
sink
into
the
class
of
counterfeits
besides
this
succumbing
has
grave
penalties
if
you
take
in
a
lie
you
must
take
in
all
that
belongs
to
it
england
accepts
this
ornamented
national
church
and
it
glazes
the
eyes
bloats
the
flesh
gives
the
voice
a
stertorous
clang
and
clouds
the
understanding
of
the
receivers
the
english
church
undermined
by
german
criticism
had
nothing
left
but
tradition
and
was
led
logically
back
to
romanism
but
that
was
an
element
which
only
hot
heads
could
breathe
in
view
of
the
educated
class
generally
it
was
not
a
fact
to
front
the
sun
and
the
alienation
of
such
men
from
the
church
became
complete
nature
to
be
sure
had
her
remedy
religious
persons
are
driven
out
of
the
established
church
into
sects
which
instantly
rise
to
credit
and
hold
the
establishment
in
check
nature
has
sharper
remedies
also
the
english
abhorring
change
in
all
things
abhorring
it
most
in
matters
of
religion
cling
to
the
last
rag
of
form
and
are
dreadfully
given
to
cant
the
english
and
i
wish
it
were
confined
to
them
but
t
is
a
taint
in
the
blood
in
both
hemispheres
the
english
and
the
americans
cant
beyond
all
other
nations
the
french
relinquish
all
that
industry
to
them
what
is
so
odious
as
the
polite
bows
to
god
in
our
books
and
newspapers
the
popular
press
is
flagitious
in
the
exact
measure
of
its
sanctimony
and
the
religion
of
the
day
is
a
theatrical
sinai
where
the
thunders
are
supplied
by
the
the
fanaticism
and
hypocrisy

of

the

at
this
moment
is
much
to
be
pitied
she
has
nothing
left
but
possession
if
a
bishop
meets
an
intelligent
gentleman
and
reads
fatal
interrogations
in
his
eyes
he
has
no
resource
but
to
take

with
him
false
position
introduces
cant
perjury
simony
and
ever
a
lower
class
of
mind
and
character
into
the
clergy
and
when
the
hierarchy
is
afraid
of
science
and
education
afraid
of
piety
afraid
of
tradition
and
afraid
of
theology
there
is
nothing
left
but
to
quit
a
church
which
is
no
longer
one
but
the
religion
of
england
is
it
the
established
church
no
is
it
the
sects
no
they
are
only
perpetuations
of
some
private
man
s
dissent
and
are
to
the
established
church
as
cabs
are
to
a
coach
cheaper
and
more
convenient
but
really
the
same
thing
where
dwells
the
religion
tell
me
first
where
dwells
electricity
or
motion
or
thought
or
gesture
they
do
not
dwell
or
stay
at
all
electricity
can
not
be
made
fast
mortared
up
and
ended
like
london
monument
or
the
tower
so
that
you
shall
know
where
to
find
it
and
keep
it
fixed
as
the
english
do
with
their
things
forevermore
it
is
passing
glancing
gesticular
it
is
a
traveller
a
newness
a
surprise
a
secret
which
perplexes
them
and
puts
them
out
yet
if
religion
be
the
doing
of
all
good
and
for
its
sake
the
suffering
of
all
evil
de
tout
le
monde
et
ne
faire
souffrir
that
divine
secret
has
existed
in
england
from
the
days
of
alfred
to
those
of
romilly
of
clarkson
and
of
florence
nightingale
and
in
thousands
who
have
no
fame
chapter
literature
a
strong
which
it
is
not
easy
to
unseat
or
disturb
marks
the
english
mind
for
a
thousand
years
a
rude
strength
newly
applied
to
thought
as
of
sailors
and
soldiers
who
had
lately
learned
to
read
they
have
no
fancy
and
never
are
surprised
into
a
covert
or
witty
word
such
as
pleased
the
athenians
and
italians
and
was
convertible
into
a
fable
not
long
after
but
they
delight
in
strong
earthy
expression
not
mistakable
coarsely
true
to
the
human
body
and
though
spoken
among
princes
equally
fit
and
welcome
to
the
mob
this
homeliness
veracity
and
plain
style
appear
in
the
earliest
extant
works
and
in
the
latest
it
imports
into
songs
and
ballads
the
smell
of
the
earth
the
breath
of
cattle
and
like
a
dutch
painter
seeks
a
household
charm
though
by
pails
and
pans
they
ask
their
constitutional
utility
in
verse
the
kail
and
herrings
are
never
out
of
sight
the
poet
nimbly
recovers
himself
from
every
sally
of
the
imagination
the
english
muse
loves
the
the
lane
and
market
she
says
with
de
sta√´l
i
tramp
in
the
mire
with
wooden
shoes
whenever
they
would
force
me
into
the
clouds
for
the
englishman
has
accurate
perceptions
takes
hold
of
things
by
the
right
end
and
there
is
no
slipperiness
in
his
grasp
he
loves
the
axe
the
spade
the
oar
the
gun
the
he
has
built
the
engine
he
uses
he
is
materialist
economical
mercantile
he
must
be
treated
with
sincerity
and
reality
with
muffins
and
not
the
promise
of
muffins
and
prefers
his
hot
chop
with
perfect
security
and
convenience
in
the
eating
of
it
to
the
chances
of
the
amplest
and
frenchiest
bill
of
fare
engraved
on
embossed
paper
when
he
is
intellectual
and
a
poet
or
a
philosopher
he
carries
the
same
hard
truth
and
the
same
keen
machinery
into
the
mental
sphere
his
mind
must
stand
on
a
fact
he
will
not
be
baffled
or
catch
at
clouds
but
the
mind
must
have
a
symbol
palpable
and
resisting
what
he
relishes
in
dante
is
the
tenacity
with
which
he
holds
a
mental
image
before
the
eyes
as
if
it
were
a
scutcheon
painted
on
a
shield
byron
liked
something
craggy
to
break
his
mind
upon
a
taste
for
plain
strong
speech
what
is
called
a
biblical
style
marks
the
english
it
is
in
alfred
and
the
saxon
chronicle
and
in
the
sagas
of
the

the

seen
in

satisfies
the
senses
shakspeare
spenser
and
milton
in
their
loftiest
ascents
have
this
national
grip
and
exactitude
of
mind
this
mental
materialism
makes
the
value
of
english
transcendental
genius
in
these
writers
and
in
herbert
henry
more
donne
and
sir
thomas
browne
the
saxon
materialism
and
narrowness
exalted
into
the
sphere
of
intellect
makes
the
very
genius
of
shakspeare
and
milton
when
it
reaches
the
pure
element
it
treads
the
clouds
as
securely
as
the
adamant
even
in
its
elevations
materialistic
its
poetry
is
inspired
or
iron
raised
to
white
heat
the
marriage
of
the
two
qualities
is
in
their
speech
it
is
a
tacit
rule
of
the
language
to
make
the
frame
or
skeleton
of
saxon
words
and
when
elevation
or
ornament
is
sought
to
interweave
roman
but
sparingly
nor
is
a
sentence
made
of
roman
words
alone
without
loss
of
strength
the
children
and

use
the
saxon
unmixed
the
latin
unmixed
is
abandoned
to
the
colleges
and
parliament
mixture
is
a
secret
of
the
english
island
and
in
their
dialect
the
male
principle
is
the
saxon
the
female
the
latin
and
they
are
combined
in
every
discourse
a
good
writer
if
he
has
indulged
in
a
roman
roundness
makes
haste
to
chasten
and
nerve
his
period
by
english
monosyllables
when
the
gothic
nations
came
into
europe
they
found
it
lighted
with
the
sun
and
moon
of
hebrew
and
of
greek
genius
the
tablets
of
their
brain
long
kept
in
the
dark
were
finely
sensible
to
the
double
glory
to
the
images
from
this
twin
source
of
christianity
and
art
the
mind
became
fruitful
as
by
the
incubation
of
the
holy
ghost
the
english
mind
flowered
in
every
faculty
the
was
surprised
and
inspired
for
two
centuries
england
was
philosophic
religious
poetic
the
mental
furniture
seemed
of
larger
scale
the
memory
capacious
like
the
storehouse
of
the
rains
the
ardor
and
endurance
of
study
the
boldness
and
facility
of
their
mental
construction
their
fancy
and
imagination
and
easy
spanning
of
vast
distances
of

the
enterprise
or
accosting
of
new
subjects
and
generally
the
easy
exertion
of
power
astonish
like
the
legendary
feats
of
guy
of
warwick
the
union
of
saxon
precision
and
oriental
soaring
of
which
shakspeare
is
the
perfect

shared
in

degree
by
the
writers
of
two
centuries
i
find
not
only
the
great
masters
out
of
all
rivalry
and
reach
but
the
whole
writing
of
the
time
charged
with
a
masculine
force
and
freedom
there
is
a
hygienic
simpleness
rough
vigor
and
closeness
to
the
matter
in
hand
even
in
the
second
and
third
class
of
writers
and
i
think
in
the
common
style
of
the
people
as
one
finds
it
in
the
citation
of
wills
letters
and
public
documents
in
proverbs
and
forms
of
speech
the
more
hearty
and
sturdy
expression
may
indicate
that
the
savageness
of
the
norseman
was
not
all
gone
their
dynamic
brains
hurled
off
their
words
as
the
revolving
stone
hurls
off
scraps
of
grit
i
could
cite
from
the
seventeenth
century
sentences
and
phrases
of
edge
not
to
be
matched
in
the
nineteenth
their
poets
by
simple
force
of
mind
equalized
themselves
with
the
accumulated
science
of
ours
the
country
gentlemen
had
a
posset
or
drink
they
called
october
and
the
poets
as
if
by
this
hint
knew
how
to
distil
the
whole
season
into
their
autumnal
verses
and
as
nature
to
pique
the
more
sometimes
works
up
deformities
into
beauty
in
some
rare
aspasia
or
cleopatra
and
as
the
greek
art
wrought
many
a
vase
or
column
in
which
too
long
or
too
lithe
or
nodes
or
pits
and
flaws
are
made
a
beauty
of
so
these
were
so
quick
and
vital
that
they
could
charm
and
enrich
by
mean
and
vulgar
objects
a
man
must
think
that
age
well
taught
and
thoughtful
by
which
masques
and
poems
like
those
of
ben
jonson
full
of
heroic
sentiment
in
a
manly
style
were
received
with
favor
the
unique
fact
in
literary
history
the
unsurprised
reception
of
shakspeare
the
reception
proved
by
his
making
his
fortune
and
the
apathy
proved
by
the
absence
of
all
contemporary
panegyric
seems
to
demonstrate
an
elevation
in
the
mind
of
the
people
judge
of
the
splendor
of
a
nation
by
the
insignificance
of
great
individuals
in
it
the
manner
in
which
they
learned
greek
and
latin
before
our
modern
facilities
were
yet
ready
without
dictionaries
grammars
or
indexes
by
lectures
of
a
professor
followed
by
their
own
searchings
required
a
more
robust
memory
and
cooperation
of
all
the
faculties
and
their
scholars
camden

the

the

their
minds
loved
analogy
were
cognizant
of

and
climbers
on
the
staircase

unity
t
is
a
very
old
strife
between
those
who
elect
to
see
identity
and
those
who
elect
to
see
discrepancies
and
it
renews
itself
in
britain
the

of
course
are
of
one
part

taylor
lord
bacon
has
the
english
duality
his
centuries
of
observations
on
useful
science
and
his
experiments
i
suppose
were
worth
nothing
one
hint
of
franklin
or
watt
or
dalton
or
davy
or
any
one
who
had
a
talent
for
experiment
was
worth
all
his
lifetime
of
exquisite
trifles
but
he
drinks
of
a
diviner
stream
and
marks
the
influx
of
idealism
into
england
where
that
goes
is
poetry
health
and
progress
the
rules
of
its
genesis
or
its
diffusion
are
not
known
that
knowledge
if
we
had
it
would
supersede
all
we
call
science
of
the
mind
it
seems
an
affair
of
race
or
of
the
vital
point
being
how
far
the
sense
of
unity
or
instinct
of
seeking
resemblances
predominated
for
wherever
the
mind
takes
a
step
it
is
to
put
itself
at
one
with
a
larger
class
discerned
beyond
the
lesser
class
with
which
it
has
been
conversant
hence
all
poetry
and
all
affirmative
action
comes
bacon
in
the
structure
of
his
mind
held
of
the
analogists
of
the
idealists
or
as
we
popularly
say
naming
from
the
best
example
platonists
whoever
discredits
analogy
and
requires
heaps
of
facts
before
any
theories
can
be
attempted
has
no
poetic
power
and
nothing
original
or
beautiful
will
be
produced
by
him
locke
is
as
surely
the
influx
of
decomposition
and
of
prose
as
bacon
and
the
platonists
of
growth
the
platonic
is
the
poetic
tendency
the
scientific
is
the
negative
and
poisonous
t
is
quite
certain
that
spenser
burns
byron
and
wordsworth
will
be
platonists
and
that
the
dull
men
will
be
lockists
then
politics
and
commerce
will
absorb
from
the
educated
class
men
of
talents
without
genius
precisely
because
such
have
no
resistance
bacon
capable
of
ideas
yet
devoted
to
ends
required
in
his
map
of
the
mind
first
of
all
universality
or
the
receptacle
for
all
such
profitable
observations
and
axioms
as
fall
not
within
the
compass
of
any
of
the
special
parts
of
philosophy
but
are
more
common
and
of
a
higher
stage
he
held
this
element
essential
it
is
never
out
of
mind
he
never
spares
rebukes
for
such
as
neglect
it
believing
that
no
perfect
discovery
can
be
made
in
a
flat
or
level
but
you
must
ascend
to
a
higher
science
if
any
man
thinketh
philosophy
and
universality
to
be
idle
studies
he
does
not
consider
that
all
professions
are
from
thence
served
and
supplied
and
this
i
take
to
be
a
great
cause
that
has
hindered
the
progression
of
learning
because
these
fundamental
knowledges
have
been
studied
but
in
passage
he
explained
himself
by
giving
various
quaint
examples
of
the
summary
or
common
laws
of
which
each
science
has
its
own
illustration
he
complains
that
he
finds
this
part
of
learning
very
deficient
the
profounder
sort
of
wits
drawing
a
bucket
now
and
then
for
their
own
use
but
the
unvisited
this
was
the
which
did
scorch
and
offend
most
men
s
watery
natures
plato
had
signified
the
same
sense
when
he
said
all
the
great
arts
require
a
subtle
and
speculative
research
into
the
law
of
nature
since
loftiness
of
thought
and
perfect
mastery
over
every
subject
seem
to
be
derived
from
some
such
source
as
this
this
pericles
had
in
addition
to
a
great
natural
genius
for
meeting
with
anaxagoras
who
was
a
person
of
this
kind
he
attached
himself
to
him
and
nourished
himself
with
sublime
speculations
on
the
absolute
intelligence
and
imported
thence
into
the
oratorical
art
whatever
could
be
useful
to
it
a
few
generalizations
always
circulate
in
the
world
whose
authors
we
do
not
rightly
know
which
astonish
and
appear
to
be
avenues
to
vast
kingdoms
of
thought
and
these
are
in
the
world
like
the
copernican
and
newtonian
theories
in
physics
in
england
these
may
be
traced
usually
to
shakspeare
bacon
milton
or
hooker
even
to
van
helmont
and
behmen
and
do
all
have
a
kind
of
filial
retrospect
to
plato
and
the
greeks
of
this
kind
is
lord
bacon
s
sentence
that
nature
is
commanded
by
obeying
her
his
doctrine
of
poetry
which
accommodates
the
shows
of
things
to
the
desires
of
the
mind
or
the
zoroastrian
definition
of
poetry
mystical
yet
exact
apparent
pictures
of
unapparent
natures
spenser
s
creed
that
soul
is
form
and
doth
the
body
make
the
theory
of
berkeley
that
we
have
no
certain
assurance
of
the
existence
of
matter
doctor
samuel
clarke
s
argument
for
theism
from
the
nature
of
space
and
time
harrington
s
political
rule
that
power
must
rest
on
land
a
rule
which
requires
to
be
liberally
interpreted
the
theory
of
swedenborg
so
cosmically
applied
by
him
that
the
man
makes
his
heaven
and
hell
hegel
s
study
of
civil
history
as
the
conflict
of
ideas
and
the
victory
of
the
deeper
thought
the
of
schelling
couched
in
the
statement
that
all
difference
is
quantitative
so
the
very
announcement
of
the
theory
of
gravitation
of
kepler
s
three
harmonic
laws
and
even
of
dalton
s
doctrine
of
definite
proportions
finds
a
sudden
response
in
the
mind
which
remains
a
superior
evidence
to
empirical
demonstrations
i
cite
these
generalizations
some
of
which
are
more
recent
merely
to
indicate
a
class
not
these
particulars
but
the
mental
plane
or
the
atmosphere
from
which
they
emanate
was
the
home
and
element
of
the
writers
and
readers
in
what
we
loosely
call
the
elizabethan
age
say
in
literary
history
the
period
from
to
yet
a
period
almost
short
enough
to
justify
ben
jonson
s
remark
on
lord
bacon
about
his
time
and
within
his
view
were
born
all
the
wits
that
could
honor
a
nation
or
help
study
such
richness
of
genius
had
not
existed
more
than
once
before
these
heights
could
not
be
maintained
as
we
find
stumps
of
vast
trees
in
our
exhausted
soils
and
have
received
traditions
of
their
ancient
fertility
to
tillage
so
history
reckons
epochs
in
which
the
intellect
of
famed
races
became
effete
so
it
fared
with
english
genius
these
heights
were
followed
by
a
meanness
and
a
descent
of
the
mind
into
lower
levels
the
loss
of
wings
no
high
speculation
locke
to
whom
the
meaning
of
ideas
was
unknown
became
the
type
of
philosophy
and
his
understanding
the
measure
in
all
nations
of
the
english
intellect
his
countrymen
forsook
the
lofty
sides
of
parnassus
on
which
they
had
once
walked
with
echoing
steps
and
disused
the
studies
once
so
beloved
the
powers
of
thought
fell
into
neglect
the
later
english
want
the
faculty
of
plato
and
aristotle
of
grouping
men
in
natural
classes
by
an
insight
of
general
laws
so
deep
that
the
rule
is
deduced
with
equal
precision
from
few
subjects
or
from
one
as
from
multitudes
of
lives
shakspeare
is
supreme
in
that
as
in
all
the
great
mental
energies
the
german
s
generalize
the
english
can
not
interpret
the
german
mind
german
science
comprehends
the
english
the
absence
of
the
faculty
in
england
is
shown
by
the
timidity
which
accumulates
mountains
of
facts
as
a
bad
general
wants
myriads
of
men
and
miles
of
redoubts
to
compensate
the
inspirations
of
courage
and
conduct
the
english
shrink
from
a
generalization
they
do
not
look
abroad
into
universality
or
they
draw
only
a
bucketful
at
the
fountain
of
the
first
philosophy
for
their
occasion
and
do
not
go
to
the
bacon
who
said
this
is
almost
unique
among
his
countrymen
in
that
faculty
at
least
among
the
milton
who
was
the
stair
or
high
to
let
down
the
english
genius
from
the
summits
of
shakspeare
used
this
privilege
sometimes
in
poetry
more
rarely
in
prose
for
a
long
interval
afterwards
it
is
not
found
burke
was
addicted
to
generalizing
but
his
was
a
shorter
line
as
his
thoughts
have
less
depth
they
have
less
compass
hume
s
abstractions
are
not
deep
or
wise
he
owes
his
fame
to
one
keen
observation
that
no
copula
had
been
detected
between
any
cause
and
effect
either
in
physics
or
in
thought
that
the
term
cause
and
effect
was
loosely
or
gratuitously
applied
to
what
we
know
only
as
consecutive
not
at
all
as
causal
johnson
s
written
abstractions
have
little
value
the
tone
of
feeling
in
them
makes
their
chief
worth
hallam
a
learned
and
elegant
scholar
has
written
the
history
of
european
literature
for
three
centuries
a
performance
of
great
ambition
inasmuch
as
a
judgment
was
to
be
attempted
on
every
book
but
his
eye
does
not
reach
to
the
ideal
standards
the
verdicts
are
all
dated
from
london
all
new
thought
must
be
cast
into
the
old
moulds
the
expansive
element
which
creates
literature
is
steadily
denied
plato
is
resisted
and
his
school
hallam
is
uniformly
polite
but
with
deficient
sympathy
writes
with
resolute
generosity
but
is
unconscious
of
the
deep
worth
which
lies
in
the
mystics
and
which
often
outvalues
as
a
seed
of
power
and
a
source
of
revolution
all
the
correct
writers
and
shining
reputations
of
their
day
he
passes
in
silence
or
dismisses
with
a
kind
of
contempt
the
profounder
masters
a
lover
of
ideas
is
not
only
uncongenial
but
unintelligible
hallam
inspires
respect
by
his
knowledge
and
fidelity
by
his
manifest
love
of
good
books
and
he
lifts
himself
to
own
better
than
almost
any
the
greatness
of
shakspeare
and
better
than
johnson
he
appreciates
milton
but
in
hallam
or
in
the
firmer
intellectual
nerve
of
mackintosh
one
still
finds
the
same
type
of
english
genius
it
is
wise
and
rich
but
it
lives
on
its
capital
it
is
retrospective
how
can
it
discern
and
hail
the
new
forms
that
are
looming
up
on
the
horizon
new
and
gigantic
thoughts
which
can
not
dress
themselves
out
of
any
old
wardrobe
of
the
past
the
essays
the
fiction
and
the
poetry
of
the
day
have
the
like
municipal
limits
dickens
with
preternatural
apprehension
of
the

of

and

varieties
of

and

his

an
industrious
writer
with

ability
is
distinguished
for
his
reverence
of
intellect
as
a

more
s
the
pity
he
thinks
but
t
is
not
for
us
to
be
wiser
we
must
renounce
ideals
and
accept
london
the
brilliant
macaulay
who
expresses
the
tone
of
the
english
governing
classes
of
the
day
explicitly
teaches
that
good
means
good
to
eat
good
to
wear
material
commodity
that
the
glory
of
modern
philosophy
is
its
direction
on
fruit
to
yield
economical
inventions
and
that
its
merit
is
to
avoid
ideas
and
avoid
morals
he
thinks
it
the
distinctive
merit
of
the
baconian
philosophy
in
its
triumph
over
the
old
platonic
its
disentangling
the
intellect
from
theories
of
the
and
and
pinning
it
down
to
the
making
a
better
and
a
better
for
an
invalid
this
not
ironically
but
in
good
faith
that
solid
advantage
as
he
calls
it
meaning
always
sensual
benefit
is
the
only
good
the
eminent
benefit
of
astronomy
is
the
better
navigation
it
creates
to
enable
the
to
bring
home
their
lemons
and
wine
to
the
london
grocer
it
was
a
curious
result
in
which
the
civility
and
religion
of
england
for
a
thousand
years
ends
in
denying
morals
and
reducing
the
intellect
to
a
saucepan
the
critic
hides
his
scepticism
under
the
english
cant
of
practical
to
convince
the
reason
to
touch
the
conscience
is
romantic
pretension
the
fine
arts
fall
to
the
ground
beauty
except
as
luxurious
commodity
does
not
exist
it
is
very
certain
i
may
say
in
passing
that
if
lord
bacon
had
been
only
the
sensualist
his
critic
pretends
he
would
never
have
acquired
the
fame
which
now
entitles
him
to
this
patronage
it
is
because
he
had
imagination
the
leisures
of
the
spirit
and
basked
in
an
element
of
contemplation
out
of
all
modern
english
atmospheric
gauges
that
he
is
impressive
to
the
imaginations
of
men
and
has
become
a
potentate
not
to
be
ignored
sir
david
brewster
sees
the
high
place
of
bacon
without
finding
newton
indebted
to
him
and
thinks
it
a
mistake
bacon
occupies
it
by
specific
gravity
or
levity
not
by
any
feat
he
did
or
by
any
tutoring
more
or
less
of
newton
but
an
effect
of
the
same
cause
which
showed
itself
more
pronounced
afterwards
in
hooke
boyle
and
halley
coleridge
a
catholic
mind
with
a
hunger
for
ideas
with
eyes
looking
before
and
after
to
the
highest
bards
and
sages
and
who
wrote
and
spoke
the
only
high
criticism
in
his
time
is
one
of
those
who
save
england
from
the
reproach
of
no
longer
possessing
the
capacity
to
appreciate
what
rarest
wit
the
island
has
yielded
yet
the
misfortune
of
his
life
his
vast
attempts
but
most
inadequate
performings
failing
to
accomplish
any
one
masterpiece
seems
to
mark
the
closing
of
an
era
even
in
him
the
traditional
englishman
was
too
strong
for
the
philosopher
and
he
fell
into
and
as
burke
had
striven
to
idealize
the
english
state
so
coleridge
narrowed
his
mind
in
the
attempt
to
reconcile
the
gothic
rule
and
dogma
of
the
anglican
church
with
eternal
ideas
but
for
coleridge
and
a
lurking
taciturn
minority
uttering
itself
in
occasional
criticism
oftener
in
private
discourse
one
would
say
that
in
germany
and
in
america
is
the
best
mind
in
england
rightly
respected
it
is
the
surest
sign
of
national
decay
when
the
bramins
can
no
longer
read
or
understand
the
braminical
philosophy
in
the
decomposition
and
asphyxia
that
followed
all
this
materialism
carlyle
was
driven
by
his
disgust
at
the
pettiness
and
the
cant
into
the
preaching
of
fate
in
comparison
with
all
this
rottenness
any
check
any
cleansing
though
by
fire
seemed
desirable
and
beautiful
he
saw
little
difference
in
the
gladiators
or
the
causes
for
which
they
combated
the
one
comfort
was
that
they
were
all
going
speedily
into
the
abyss
together
and
his
imagination
finding
no
nutriment
in
any
creation
avenged
itself
by
celebrating
the
majestic
beauty
of
the
laws
of
decay
the
necessities
of
mental
structure
force
all
minds
into
a
few
categories
and
where
impatience
of
the
tricks
of
men
makes
nemesis
amiable
and
builds
altars
to
the
negative
deity
the
inevitable
recoil
is
to
heroism
or
the
gallantry
of
the
private
heart
which
decks
its
immolation
with
glory
in
the
unequal
combat
of
will
against
fate
wilkinson
the
editor
of
swedenborg
the
annotator
of
fourier
and
the
champion
of
halmeman
has
brought
to
metaphysics
and
to
physiology
a
native
vigor
with
a
catholic
perception
of
relations
equal
to
the
highest
attempts
and
a
rhetoric
like
the
armory
of
the
invincible
knights
of
old
there
is
in
the
action
of
his
mind
a
long
atlantic
roll
not
known
except
in
deepest
waters
and
only
lacking
what
ought
to
accompany
such
powers
a
manifest
centrality
if
his
mind
does
not
rest
in
immovable
biases
perhaps
the
orbit
is
larger
and
the
return
is
not
yet
but
a
master
should
inspire
a
confidence
that
he
will
adhere
to
his
convictions
and
give
his
present
studies
always
the
same
high
place
it
would
be
easy
to
add
exceptions
to
the
limitary
tone
of
english
thought
and
much
more
easy
to
adduce
examples
of
excellence
in
particular
veins
and
if
going
out
of
the
region
of
dogma
we
pass
into
that
of
general
culture
there
is
no
end
to
the
graces
and
amenities
wit
sensibility
and
erudition
of
the
learned
class
but
the
artificial
succor
which
marks
all
english
performance
appears
in
letters
also
much
of
their
√¶sthetic
production
is
antiquarian
and
manufactured
and
literary
reputations
have
been
achieved
by
forcible
men
whose
relation
to
literature
was
purely
accidental
but
who
were
driven
by
tastes
and
modes
they
found
in
vogue
into
their
several
careers
so
at
this
moment
every
ambitious
young
man
studies
geology
so
members
of
parliament
are
made
and
churchmen
the
bias
of
englishmen
to
practical
skill
has
reacted
on
the
national
mind
they
are
incapable
of
an
inutility
and
respect
the
five
mechanic
powers
even
in
their
song
the
voice
of
their
modern
muse
has
a
slight
hint
of
the
and
the
poem
is
created
as
an
ornament
and
finish
of
their
monarchy
and
by
no
means
as
the
bird
of
a
new
morning
which
forgets
the
past
world
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
that
which
is
forming
they
are
with
difficulty
ideal
they
are
the
most
conditioned
men
as
if
having
the
best
conditions
they
could
not
bring
themselves
to
forfeit
them
every
one
of
them
is
a
thousand
years
old
and
lives
by
his
memory
and
when
you
say
this
they
accept
it
as
praise
nothing
comes
to
the
but
politics
travels
statistics
tabulation
and
engineering
and
even
what
is
called
philosophy
and
letters
is
mechanical
in
its
structure
as
if
inspiration
had
ceased
as
if
no
vast
hope
no
religion
no
song
of
joy
no
wisdom
no
analogy
existed
any
more
the
tone
of
colleges
and
of
scholars
and
of
literary
society
has
this
mortal
air
i
seem
to
walk
on
a
marble
floor
where
nothing
will
grow
they
exert
every
variety
of
talent
on
a
lower
ground
and
may
be
said
to
live
and
act
in
a
they
have
lost
all
commanding
views
in
literature
philosophy
and
science
a
good
englishman
shuts
himself
out
of
three
fourths
of
his
mind
and
confines
himself
to
one
fourth
he
has
learning
good
sense
power
of
labor
and
logic
but
a
faith
in
the
laws
of
the
mind
like
that
of
archimedes
a
belief
like
that
of
euler
and
kepler
that
experience
must
follow
and
not
lead
the
laws
of
the
mind
a
devotion
to
the
theory
of
politics
like
that
of
hooker
and
milton
and
harrington
the
modern
english
mind
repudiates
i
fear
the
same
fault
lies
in
their
science
since
they
have
known
how
to
make
it
repulsive
and
bereave
nature
of
its
charm
though
perhaps
the
complaint
flies
wider
and
the
vice
attaches
to
many
more
than
to
british
physicists
the
eye
of
the
naturalist
must
have
a
scope
like
nature
itself
a
susceptibility
to
all
impressions
alive
to
the
heart
as
well
as
to
the
logic
of
creation
but
english
science
puts
humanity
to
the
door
it
wants
the
connection
which
is
the
test
of
genius
the
science
is
false
by
not
being
poetic
it
isolates
the
reptile
or
mollusk
it
assumes
to
explain
whilst
reptile
or
mollusk
only
exists
in
system
in
relation
the
poet
only
sees
it
as
an
inevitable
step
in
the
path
of
the
creator
but
in
england
one
hermit
finds
this
fact
and
another
finds
that
and
lives
and
dies
ignorant
of
its
value
there
are
great
exceptions
of
john
hunter
a
man
of
ideas
perhaps
of
robert
brown
the
botanist
and
of
richard
owen
who
has
imported
into
britain
the
german
homologies
and
enriched
science
with
contributions
of
his
own
adding
sometimes
the
divination
of
the
old
masters
to
the
unbroken
power
of
labor
in
the
english
mind
but
for
the
most
part
the
natural
science
in
england
is
out
of
its
loyal
alliance
with
morals
and
is
as
void
of
imagination
and
free
play
of
thought
as
conveyancing
it
stands
in
strong
contrast
with
the
genius
of
the
germans
those
who
love
analogy
and
by
means
of
their
height
of
view
preserve
their
enthusiasm
and
think
for
europe
no
hope
no
sublime
augury
cheers
the
student
no
secure
striding
from
experiment
onward
to
a
foreseen
law
but
only
a
casual
dipping
here
and
there
like
diggers
in
california
prospecting
for
a
placer
that
will
pay
a
horizon
of
brass
of
the
diameter
of
his
umbrella
shuts
down
around
his
senses
squalid
contentment
with
conventions
satire
at
the
names
of
philosophy
and
religion
parochial
and
politics
and
idolatry
of
usage
betray
the
ebb
of
life
and
spirit
as
they
trample
on
nationalities
to
reproduce
london
and
londoners
in
europe
and
asia
so
they
fear
the
hostility
of
ideas
of
poetry
of
religion
ghosts
which
they
can
not
lay
and
having
attempted
to
domesticate
and
dress
the
blessed
soul
itself
in
english
broadcloth
and
gaiters
they
are
tormented
with
fear
that
herein
lurks
a
force
that
will
sweep
their
system
away
the
artists
say
nature
puts
us
out
the
scholars
have
become
they
parry
earnest
speech
with
banter
and
levity
they
laugh
you
down
or
they
change
the
subject
the
fact
is
say
they
over
their
wine
all
that
about
liberty
and
so
forth
is
gone
by
it
won
t
do
any
longer
the
practical
and
comfortable
oppress
them
with
inexorable
claims
and
the
smallest
fraction
of
power
remains
for
heroism
and
poetry
no
poet
dares
murmur
of
beauty
out
of
the
precinct
of
his
rhymes
no
priest
dares
hint
at
a
providence
which
does
not
respect
english
utility
the
island
is
a
roaring
volcano
of
fate
of
material
values
of
tariffs
and
laws
of
repression
glutted
markets
and
low
prices
in
the
absence
of
the
highest
aims
of
the
pure
love
of
knowledge
and
the
surrender
to
nature
there
is
the
suppression
of
the
imagination
the
priapism
of
the
senses
and
the
understanding
we
have
the
factitious
instead
of
the
natural
tasteless
expense
arts
of
comfort
and
the
rewarding
as
an
illustrious
inventor
whosoever
will
contrive
one
impediment
more
to
interpose
between
the
man
and
his
objects
thus
poetry
is
degraded
and
made
ornamental
pope
and
his
school
wrote
poetry
fit
to
put
round
frosted
cake
what
did
walter
scott
write
without
stint
a
rhymed
traveller
s
guide
to
scotland
and
the
libraries
of
verses
they
print
have
this
birmingham
character
how
many
volumes
of
metre
we
must
jingle
through
before
we
can
be
filled
taught
renewed
we
want
the
miraculous
the
beauty
which
we
can
manufacture
at
no
mill
can
give
no
account
of
the
beauty
of
which
chaucer
and
chapman
had
the
secret
the
poetry
of
course
is
low
and
prosaic
only
now
and
then
as
in
wordsworth
conscientious
or
in
byron
passional
or
in
tennyson
factitious
but
if
i
should
count
the
poets
who
have
contributed
to
the
bible
of
existing
england
sentences
of
guidance
and
consolation
which
are
still
glowing
and
effective
how
few
shall
i
find
my
heavenly
bread
in
the
reigning
poets
where
is
great
design
in
modern
english
poetry
the
english
have
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
poetry
exists
to
speak
the
spiritual
law
and
that
no
wealth
of
description
or
of
fancy
is
yet
essentially
new
and
out
of
the
limits
of
prose
until
this
condition
is
reached
therefore
the
grave
old
poets
like
the
greek
artists
heeded
their
designs
and
less
considered
the
finish
it
was
their
office
to
lead
to
the
divine
sources
out
of
which
all
this
and
much
more
readily
springs
and
if
this
religion
is
in
the
poetry
it
raises
us
to
some
purpose
and
we
can
well
afford
some
staidness
or
hardness
or
want
of
popular
tune
in
the
verses
the
exceptional
fact
of
the
period
is
the
genius
of
wordsworth
he
had
no
master
but
nature
and
solitude
he
wrote
a
poem
says
landor
without
the
aid
of
war
his
verse
is
the
voice
of
sanity
in
a
worldly
and
ambitious
age
one
regrets
that
his
temperament
was
not
more
liquid
and
musical
he
has
written
longer
than
he
was
inspired
but
for
the
rest
he
has
no
competitor
tennyson
is
endowed
precisely
in
points
where
wordsworth
wanted
there
is
no
finer
ear
than
tennyson
s
nor
more
command
of
the
keys
of
language
color
like
the
dawn
flows
over
the
horizon
from
his
pencil
in
waves
so
rich
that
we
do
not
miss
the
central
form
through
all
his
refinements
too
he
has
reached
the
public
a
certificate
of
good
sense
and
general
power
since
he
who
aspires
to
be
the
english
poet
must
be
as
large
as
london
not
in
the
same
kind
as
london
but
in
his
own
kind
but
he
wants
a
subject
and
climbs
no
mount
of
vision
to
bring
its
secrets
to
the
people
he
contents
himself
with
describing
the
englishman
as
he
is
and
proposes
no
better
there
are
all
degrees
in
poetry
and
we
must
be
thankful
for
every
beautiful
talent
but
it
is
only
a
first
success
when
the
ear
is
gained
the
best
office
of
the
best
poets
has
been
to
show
how
low
and
uninspired
was
their
general
style
and
that
only
once
or
twice
they
have
struck
the
high
chord
that
expansiveness
which
is
the
essence
of
the
poetic
element
they
have
not
it
was
no
oxonian
but
hafiz
who
said
let
us
be
crowned
with
roses
let
us
drink
wine
and
break
up
the
tiresome
old
roof
of
heaven
into
new
forms
a
stanza
of
the
song
of
nature
the
oxonian
has
no
ear
for
and
he
does
not
value
the
salient
and
curative
influence
of
intellectual
action
studious
of
truth
without
a
by
the
law
of
contraries
i
look
for
an
irresistible
taste
for
orientalism
in
britain
for
a
modish
life
made
up
of
trifles
clinging
to
a
corporeal
civilization
hating
ideas
there
is
no
remedy
like
the
oriental
largeness
that
astonishes
and
disconcerts
english
decorum
for
once
there
is
thunder
it
never
heard
light
it
never
saw
and
power
which
trifles
with
time
and
space
i
am
not
surprised
then
to
find
an
englishman
like
warren
hastings
who
had
been
struck
with
the
grand
style
of
thinking
in
the
indian
writings
deprecating
the
prejudices
of
his
countrymen
while
offering
them
a
translation
of
the
bhagvat
might
i
he
says
an
unlettered
man
venture
to
prescribe
bounds
to
the
latitude
of
criticism
i
should
exclude
in
estimating
the
merit
of
such
a
production
all
rules
drawn
from
the
ancient
or
modern
literature
of
europe
all
references
to
such
sentiments
or
manners
as
are
become
the
standards
of
propriety
for
opinion
and
action
in
our
own
modes
and
equally
all
appeals
to
our
revealed
tenets
of
religion
and
moral
duty
he
goes
on
to
bespeak
indulgence
to
ornaments
of
fancy
unsuited
to
our
taste
and
passages
elevated
to
a
tract
of
sublimity
into
which
our
habits
of
judgment
will
find
it
difficult
to
pursue
them
preface
to
wilkins
s
translation
of
the
bhagvat
geeta
meantime
i
know
that
a
retrieving
power
lies
in
the
english
race
which
seems
to
make
any
recoil
possible
in
other
words
there
is
at
all
times
a
minority
of
profound
minds
existing
in
the
nation
capable
of
appreciating
every
soaring
of
intellect
and
every
hint
of
tendency
while
the
constructive
talent
seems
dwarfed
and
superficial
the
criticism
is
often
in
the
noblest
tone
and
suggests
the
presence
of
the
invisible
gods
i
can
well
believe
what
i
have
often
heard
that
there
are
two
nations
in
england
but
it
is
not
the
poor
and
the
rich
nor
is
it
the
normans
and
saxons
nor
the
celt
and
the
goth
these
are
each
always
becoming
the
other
for
robert
owen
does
not
exaggerate
the
power
of
circumstance
but
the
two
complexions
or
two
styles
of
mind
the
perceptive
class
and
the
practical
finality
class
are
ever
in
counterpoise
interacting
mutually
one
in
hopeless
minorities
the
other
in
huge
masses
one
studious
contemplative
experimenting
the
other
the
ungrateful
pupil
scornful
of
the
source
whilst
availing
itself
of
the
knowledge
for
gain
these
two
nations
of
genius
and
of
animal
force
though
the
first
consist
of
only
a
dozen
souls
and
the
second
of
twenty
millions
forever
by
their
discord
and
their
accord
yield
the
power
of
the
english
state
chapter
the
times
the
power
of
the
newspaper
is
familiar
in
america
and
in
accordance
with
our
political
system
in
england
it
stands
in
antagonism
with
the
feudal
institutions
and
it
is
all
the
more
beneficent
succor
against
the
secretive
tendencies
of
a
monarchy
the
celebrated
lord
somers
knew
of
no
good
law
proposed
and
passed
in
his
time
to
which
the
public
papers
had
not
directed
his
attention
there
is
no
corner
and
no
night
a
relentless
inquisition
drags
every
secret
to
the
day
turns
the
glare
of
this
solar
microscope
on
every
malfaisance
so
as
to
make
the
public
a
more
terrible
spy
than
any
foreigner
and
no
weakness
can
be
taken
advantage
of
by
an
enemy
since
the
whole
people
are
already
forewarned
thus
england
rids
herself
of
those
incrustations
which
have
been
the
ruin
of
old
states
of
course
this
inspection
is
feared
no
antique
privilege
no
comfortable
monopoly
but
sees
surely
that
its
days
are
counted
the
people
are
familiarized
with
the
reason
of
reform
and
one
by
one
take
away
every
argument
of
the
obstructives
so
your
grace
likes
the
comfort
of
reading
the
newspapers
said
lord
mansfield
to
the
duke
of
northumberland
mark
my
words
you
and
i
shall
not
live
to
see
it
but
this
young
gentleman
lord
eldon
may
or
it
may
be
a
little
later
but
a
little
sooner
or
later
these
newspapers
will
most
assuredly
write
the
dukes
of
northumberland
out
of
their
titles
and
possessions
and
the
country
out
of
its
king
the
tendency
in
england
towards
social
and
political
institutions
like
those
of
america
is
inevitable
and
the
ability
of
its
journals
is
the
driving
force
england
is
full
of
manly
clever
men
who
possess
the
talent
of
writing
pungent
paragraphs
expressing
with
clearness
and
courage
their
opinion
on
any
person
or
performance
valuable
or
not
it
is
a
skill
that
is
rarely
found
out
of
the
english
journals
the
english
do
this
as
they
write
poetry
as
they
ride
and
box
by
being
educated
to
it
hundreds
of
clever
praeds
and
freres
and
froudes
and
hoods
and
hooks
and
maginns
and
mills
and
macaulays
make
poems
or
short
essays
for
a
journal
as
they
make
speeches
in
parliament
and
on
the
hustings
or
as
they
shoot
and
ride
it
is
a
quite
accidental
and
arbitrary
direction
of
their
general
ability
rude
health
and
spirits
an
oxford
education
and
the
habits
of
society
are
implied
but
not
a
ray
of
genius
it
comes
of
the
crowded
state
of
the
professions
the
violent
interest
which
all
men
take
in
politics
the
facility
of
experimenting
in
the
journals
and
high
pay
the
most
conspicuous
result
of
this
talent
is
the
times
newspaper
no
power
in
england
is
more
felt
more
feared
or
more
obeyed
what
you
read
in
the
morning
in
that
journal
you
shall
hear
in
the
evening
in
all
society
it
has
ears
everywhere
and
its
information
is
earliest
completest
and
surest
it
has
risen
year
by
year
and
victory
by
victory
to
its
present
authority
i
asked
one
of
its
old
contributors
whether
it
had
once
been
abler
than
it
is
now
never
he
said
these
are
its
palmiest
days
it
has
shown
those
qualities
which
are
dear
to
englishmen
unflinching
adherence
to
its
objects
prodigal
intellectual
ability
and
a
towering
assurance
backed
by
the
perfect
organization
in
its
and
its
network
of
correspondence
and
reports
it
has
its
own
history
and
famous
trophies
in
it
adopted
the
cause
of
queen
caroline
and
carried
it
against
the
king
it
adopted
a
system
and
almost
alone
lifted
it
through
when
lord
brougham
was
in
power
it
decided
against
him
and
pulled
him
down
it
declared
war
against
ireland
and
conquered
it
it
adopted
the
league
against
the
corn
laws
and
when
cobden
had
begun
to
despair
it
announced
his
triumph
it
denounced
and
discredited
the
french
republic
of
and
checked
every
sympathy
with
it
in
england
until
it
had
enrolled
special
constables
to
watch
the
chartists
and
make
them
ridiculous
on
the
april
it
first
denounced
and
then
adopted
the
new
french
empire
and
urged
the
french
alliance
and
its
results
it
has
entered
into
each
municipal
literary
and
social
question
almost
with
a
controlling
voice
it
has
done
bold
and
seasonable
service
in
exposing
frauds
which
threatened
the
commercial
community
meantime
it
attacks
its
rivals
by
perfecting
its
printing
machinery
and
will
drive
them
out
of
circulation
for
the
only
limit
to
the
circulation
of
the
times
is
the
impossibility
of
printing
copies
fast
enough
since
a
daily
paper
can
only
be
new
and
seasonable
for
a
few
hours
it
will
kill
all
but
that
paper
which
is
diametrically
in
opposition
since
many
papers
first
and
last
have
lived
by
their
attacks
on
the
leading
journal
the
late
walter
was
printer
of
the
times
and
had
gradually
arranged
the
whole
of
it
in
perfect
system
it
is
told
that
when
he
demanded
a
small
share
in
the
proprietary
and
was
refused
he
said
as
you
please
gentlemen
and
you
may
take
away
the
times
from
this
office
when
you
will
i
shall
publish
the
new
times
next
monday
morning
the
proprietors
who
had
already
complained
that
his
charges
for
printing
were
excessive
found
that
they
were
in
his
power
and
gave
him
whatever
he
wished
i
went
one
day
with
a
good
friend
to
the
times
office
which
was
entered
through
a
pretty
in
square
we
walked
with
some
circumspection
as
if
we
were
entering
a
but
the
door
was
opened
by
a
mild
old
woman
and
by
dint
of
some
transmission
of
cards
we
were
at
last
conducted
into
the
parlor
of
morris
a
very
gentle
person
with
no
hostile
appearances
the
statistics
are
now
quite
out
of
date
but
i
remember
he
told
us
that
the
daily
printing
was
then
copies
that
on
the
march
the
greatest
number
ever
printed
were
issued
that
since
february
the
daily
circulation
had
increased
by
copies
the
old
press
they
were
then
using
printed
five
or
six
thousand
sheets
per
hour
the
new
machine
for
which
they
were
then
building
an
engine
would
print
twelve
thousand
per
hour
our
entertainer
confided
us
to
a
courteous
assistant
to
show
us
the
establishment
in
which
i
think
they
employed
a
hundred
and
twenty
men
i
remember
i
saw
the
reporters
room
in
which
they
redact
their
hasty
stenographs
but
the
editor
s
room
and
who
is
in
it
i
did
not
see
though
i
shared
the
curiosity
of
mankind
respecting
it
the
staff
of
the
times
has
always
been
made
up
of
able
men
old
walter
sterling
bacon
barnes
alsiger
horace
twiss
jones
loyd
john
oxenford
mosely
bailey
have
contributed
to
its
renown
in
their
special
departments
but
it
has
never
wanted
the
first
pens
for
occasional
assistance
its
private
information
is
inexplicable
and
recalls
the
stories
of
fouch√©
s
police
whose
omniscience
made
it
believed
that
the
empress
josephine
must
be
in
his
pay
it
has
mercantile
and
political
correspondents
in
every
foreign
city
and
its
expresses
outrun
the
despatches
of
the
government
one
hears
anecdotes
of
the
rise
of
its
servants
as
of
the
functionaries
of
the
india
house
i
was
told
of
the
dexterity
of
one
of
its
reporters
who
finding
himself
on
one
occasion
where
the
magistrates
had
strictly
forbidden
reporters
put
his
hands
into
his
and
with
pencil
in
one
hand
and
tablet
in
the
other
did
his
work
the
influence
of
this
journal
is
a
recognized
power
in
europe
and
of
course
none
is
more
conscious
of
it
than
its
conductors
the
tone
of
its
articles
has
often
been
the
occasion
of
comment
from
the
official
organs
of
the
continental
courts
and
sometimes
the
ground
of
diplomatic
complaint
what
would
the
times
say
is
a
terror
in
paris
in
berlin
in
vienna
in
copenhagen
and
in
nepaul
its
consummate
discretion
and
success
exhibit
the
english
skill
of
combination
the
daily
paper
is
the
work
of
many
hands
chiefly
it
is
said
of
young
men
recently
from
the
university
and
perhaps
reading
law
in
chambers
in
london
hence
the
academic
elegance
and
classic
allusion
which
adorn
its
columns
hence
too
the
heat
and
gallantry
of
its
onset
but
the
steadiness
of
the
aim
suggests
the
belief
that
this
fire
is
directed
and
fed
by
older
engineers
as
if
persons
of
exact
information
and
with
settled
views
of
policy
supplied
the
writers
with
the
basis
of
fact
and
the
object
to
be
attained
and
availed
themselves
of
their
younger
energy
and
eloquence
to
plead
the
cause
both
the
council
and
the
executive
departments
gain
by
this
division
of
two
men
of
equal
ability
the
one
who
does
not
write
but
keeps
his
eye
on
the
course
of
public
affairs
will
have
the
higher
judicial
wisdom
but
the
parts
are
kept
in
concert
all
the
articles
appear
to
proceed
from
a
single
will
the
times
never
disapproves
of
what
itself
has
said
or
cripples
itself
by
apology
for
the
absence
of
the
editor
or
the
indiscretion
of
him
who
held
the
pen
it
speaks
out
bluff
and
bold
and
sticks
to
what
it
says
it
draws
from
any
number
of
learned
and
skilful
contributors
but
a
more
learned
and
skilful
person
supervises
corrects
and
of
this
closet
the
secret
does
not
transpire
no
writer
is
suffered
to
claim
the
authorship
of
any
paper
everything
good
from
whatever
quarter
comes
out
editorially
and
thus
by
making
the
paper
everything
and
those
who
write
it
nothing
the
character
and
the
awe
of
the
journal
gain
the
english
like
it
for
its
complete
information
a
statement
of
fact
in
the
times
is
as
reliable
as
a
citation
from
hansard
then
they
like
its
independence
they
do
not
know
when
they
take
it
up
what
their
paper
is
going
to
say
but
above
all
for
the
nationality
and
confidence
of
its
tone
it
thinks
for
them
all
it
is
their
understanding
and
day
s
ideal
daguerreotyped
when
i
see
them
reading
its
columns
they
seem
to
me
becoming
every
moment
more
british
it
has
the
national
courage
not
rash
and
petulant
but
considerate
and
determined
no
dignity
or
wealth
is
a
shield
from
its
assault
it
attacks
a
duke
as
readily
as
a
policeman
and
with
the
most
provoking
airs
of
condescension
it
makes
rude
work
with
the
board
of
admiralty
the
bench
of
bishops
is
still
less
safe
one
bishop
fares
badly
for
his
rapacity
and
another
for
his
bigotry
and
a
third
for
his
courtliness
it
addresses
occasionally
a
hint
to
majesty
itself
and
sometimes
a
hint
which
is
taken
there
is
an
air
of
freedom
even
in
their
advertising
columns
which
speaks
well
for
england
to
a
foreigner
on
the
days
when
i
arrived
in
london
in
i
read
among
the
daily
announcements
one
offering
a
reward
of
fifty
pounds
to
any
person
who
would
put
a
nobleman
described
by
name
and
title
late
a
member
of
parliament
into
any
county
jail
in
england
he
having
been
convicted
of
obtaining
money
under
false
pretences
was
never
such
arrogancy
as
the
tone
of
this
paper
every
slip
of
an
oxonian
or
cantabrigian
who
writes
his
first
leader
assumes
that
we
subdued
the
earth
before
we
sat
down
to
write
this
particular
times
one
would
think
the
world
was
on
its
knees
to
the
times
office
for
its
daily
breakfast
but
this
arrogance
is
calculated
who
would
care
for
it
if
it
surmised
or
dared
to
confess
or
ventured
to
predict
no
is
and
so
it
shall
be
the
morality
and
patriotism
of
the
times
claims
only
to
be
representative
and
by
no
means
ideal
it
gives
the
argument
not
of
the
majority
but
of
the
commanding
class
its
editors
know
better
than
to
defend
russia
or
austria
or
english
vested
rights
on
abstract
grounds
but
they
give
a
voice
to
the
class
who
at
the
moment
take
the
lead
and
they
have
an
instinct
for
finding
where
the
power
now
lies
which
is
eternally
shifting
its
banks
sympathizing
with
and
speaking
for
the
class
that
rules
the
hour
yet
being
apprised
of
every
every
chartist
resolution
every
church
squabble
every
strike
in
the
mills
they
detect
the
first
tremblings
of
change
they
watch
the
hard
and
bitter
struggles
of
the
authors
of
each
liberal
movement
year
by
year
watching
them
only
to
taunt
and
obstruct
them
until
at
last
when
they
see
that
these
have
established
their
fact
that
power
is
on
the
point
of
passing
to
them
they
strike
in
with
the
voice
of
a
monarch
astonish
those
whom
they
succor
as
much
as
those
whom
they
desert
and
make
victory
sure
of
course
the
aspirants
see
that
the
times
is
one
of
the
goods
of
fortune
not
to
be
won
but
by
winning
their
cause
punch
is
equally
an
expression
of
english
good
sense
as
the
london
times
it
is
the
comic
version
of
the
same
sense
many
of
its
caricatures
are
equal
to
the
best
pamphlets
and
will
convey
to
the
eye
in
an
instant
the
popular
view
which
was
taken
of
each
turn
of
public
affairs
its
sketches
are
usually
made
by
masterly
hands
and
sometimes
with
genius
the
delight
of
every
class
because
uniformly
guided
by
that
taste
which
is
tyrannical
in
england
it
is
a
new
trait
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
the
wit
and
humor
of
england
as
in
punch
so
in
the
humorists
jerrold
dickens
thackeray
hood
have
taken
the
direction
of
humanity
and
freedom
the
times
like
every
important
institution
shows
the
way
to
a
better
it
is
a
living
index
of
the
colossal
british
power
its
existence
honors
the
people
who
dare
to
print
all
they
know
dare
to
know
all
the
facts
and
do
not
wish
to
be
flattered
by
hiding
the
extent
of
the
public
disaster
there
is
always
safety
in
valor
i
wish
i
could
add
that
this
journal
aspired
to
deserve
the
power
it
wields
by
guidance
of
the
public
sentiment
to
the
right
it
is
usually
pretended
in
parliament
and
elsewhere
that
the
english
press
has
a
high
tone
which
it
has
not
it
has
an
imperial
tone
as
of
a
powerful
and
independent
nation
but
as
with
other
empires
its
tone
is
prone
to
be
official
and
even
officinal
the
times
shares
all
the
limitations
of
the
governing
classes
and
wishes
never
to
be
in
a
minority
if
only
it
dared
to
cleave
to
the
right
to
show
the
right
to
be
the
only
expedient
and
feed
its
batteries
from
the
central
heart
of
humanity
it
might
not
have
so
many
men
of
rank
among
its
contributors
but
genius
would
be
its
cordial
and
invincible
ally
it
might
now
and
then
bear
the
brunt
of
formidable
combinations
but
no
journal
is
ruined
by
wise
courage
it
would
be
the
natural
leader
of
british
reform
its
proud
function
that
of
being
the
voice
of
europe
the
defender
of
the
exile
and
patriot
against
despots
would
be
more
effectually
discharged
it
would
have
the
authority
which
is
claimed
for
that
dream
of
good
men
not
yet
come
to
pass
an
international
congress
and
the
least
of
its
victories
would
be
to
give
to
england
a
new
millennium
of
beneficent
power
chapter
stonehenge
it
had
been
agreed
between
my
friend
and
me
that
before
i
left
england
we
should
make
an
excursion
together
to
stonehenge
which
neither
of
us
had
seen
and
the
project
pleased
my
fancy
with
the
double
attraction
of
the
monument
and
the
companion
it
seemed
a
bringing
together
of
extreme
points
to
visit
the
oldest
religious
monument
in
britain
in
company
with
her
latest
thinker
and
one
whose
influence
may
be
traced
in
every
contemporary
book
i
was
glad
to
sum
up
a
little
my
experiences
and
to
exchange
a
few
reasonable
words
on
the
aspects
of
england
with
a
man
on
whose
genius
i
set
a
very
high
value
and
who
had
as
much
penetration
and
as
severe
a
theory
of
duty
as
any
person
in
it
on
friday
july
we
took
the
railway
through
hampshire
to
salisbury
where
we
found
a
carriage
to
convey
us
to
amesbury
the
fine
weather
and
my
friend
s
local
knowledge
of
hampshire
in
which
he
is
wont
to
spend
a
part
of
every
summer
made
the
way
short
there
was
much
to
say
too
of
the
travelling
americans
and
their
usual
objects
in
london
i
thought
it
natural
that
they
should
give
some
time
to
works
of
art
collected
here
which
they
can
not
find
at
home
and
a
little
to
scientific
clubs
and
museums
which
at
this
moment
make
london
very
attractive
but
my
philosopher
was
not
contented
art
and
high
art
is
a
favorite
target
for
his
wit
yes
is
a
great
delusion
and
goethe
and
schiller
wasted
a
great
deal
of
good
time
on
it
and
he
thinks
he
discovers
that
old
goethe
found
this
out
and
in
his
later
writings
changed
his
tone
as
soon
as
men
begin
to
talk
of
art
architecture
and
antiquities
nothing
good
comes
of
it
he
wishes
to
go
through
the
british
museum
in
silence
and
thinks
a
sincere
man
will
see
something
and
say
nothing
in
these
days
he
thought
it
would
become
an
architect
to
consult
only
the
grim
necessity
and
say
i
can
build
you
a
coffin
for
such
dead
persons
as
you
are
and
for
such
dead
purposes
as
you
have
but
you
shall
have
no
for
the
science
he
had
if
possible
even
less
tolerance
and
compared
the
savans
of
somerset
house
to
the
boy
who
asked
confucius
how
many
stars
in
the
sky
confucius
replied
he
minded
things
near
him
then
said
the
boy
how
many
hairs
are
there
in
your
eyebrows
confucius
said
he
didn
t
know
and
didn
t
care
still
speaking
of
the
americans
complained
that
they
dislike
the
coldness
and
exclusiveness
of
the
english
and
run
away
to
france
and
go
with
their
countrymen
and
are
amused
instead
of
manfully
staying
in
london
and
confronting
englishmen
and
acquiring
their
culture
who
really
have
much
to
teach
them
i
told
that
i
was
easily
dazzled
and
was
accustomed
to
concede
readily
all
that
an
englishman
would
ask
i
saw
everywhere
in
the
country
proofs
of
sense
and
spirit
and
success
of
every
sort
i
like
the
people
they
are
as
good
as
they
are
handsome
they
have
everything
and
can
do
everything
but
meantime
i
surely
know
that
as
soon
as
i
return
to
massachusetts
i
shall
lapse
at
once
into
the
feeling
which
the
geography
of
america
inevitably
inspires
that
we
play
the
game
with
immense
advantage
that
there
and
not
here
is
the
seat
and
centre
of
the
british
race
and
that
no
skill
or
activity
can
long
compete
with
the
prodigious
natural
advantages
of
that
country
in
the
hands
of
the
same
race
and
that
england
an
old
and
exhausted
island
must
one
day
be
contented
like
other
parents
to
be
strong
only
in
her
children
but
this
was
a
proposition
which
no
englishman
of
whatever
condition
can
easily
entertain
we
left
the
train
at
salisbury
and
took
a
carriage
to
amesbury
passing
by
old
sarum
a
bare
treeless
hill
once
containing
the
town
which
sent
two
members
to
parliament
now
not
a
hut
and
arriving
at
amesbury
stopped
at
the
george
inn
after
dinner
we
walked
to
salisbury
plain
on
the
broad
downs
under
the
gray
sky
not
a
house
was
visible
nothing
but
stonehenge
which
looked
like
a
group
of
brown
dwarfs
in
the
wide
expanse
stonehenge
and
the
barrows
which
rose
like
green
bosses
about
the
plain
and
a
few
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
the
old
temple
would
not
be
more
impressive
far
and
wide
a
few
shepherds
with
their
flocks
sprinkled
the
plain
and
a
bagman
drove
along
the
road
it
looked
as
if
the
wide
margin
given
in
this
crowded
isle
to
this
primeval
temple
were
accorded
by
the
veneration
of
the
british
race
to
the
old
egg
out
of
which
all
their
ecclesiastical
structures
and
history
had
proceeded
stonehenge
is
a
circular
colonnade
with
a
diameter
of
a
hundred
feet
and
enclosing
a
second
and
a
third
colonnade
within
we
walked
round
the
stones
and
clambered
over
them
to
wont
ourselves
with
their
strange
aspect
and
groupings
and
found
a
nook
sheltered
from
the
wind
among
them
where
lighted
his
cigar
it
was
pleasant
to
see
that
just
this
simplest
of
all
simple
structures
two
upright
stones
and
a
lintel
laid
across
had
long
outstood
all
later
churches
and
all
history
and
were
like
what
is
most
permanent
on
the
face
of
the
planet
these
and
the
barrows
mere
mounds
of
which
there
are
a
hundred
and
sixty
within
a
circle
of
three
miles
about
stonehenge
like
the
same
mound
on
the
plain
of
troy
which
still
makes
good
to
the
passing
mariner
on
hellespont
the
vaunt
of
homer
and
the
fame
of
achilles
within
the
enclosure
grow
buttercups
nettles
and
all
around
wild
thyme
daisy
thistle
and
the
carpeting
grass
over
us
larks
were
soaring
and
singing
as
my
friend
said
the
larks
which
were
hatched
last
year
and
the
wind
which
was
hatched
many
thousand
years
ago
we
counted
and
measured
by
paces
the
biggest
stones
and
soon
knew
as
much
as
any
man
can
suddenly
know
of
the
inscrutable
temple
there
are
stones
and
there
were
once
probably
one
hundred
and
sixty
the
temple
is
circular
and
uncovered
and
the
situation
fixed
astronomically
the
grand
entrances
here
and
at
abury
being
placed
exactly
as
all
the
gates
of
the
old
cavern
temples
are
how
came
the
stones
here
for
these
or
druidical
sandstones
are
not
found
in
this
neighborhood
the
as
it
is
called
is
the
only
one
in
all
these
blocks
that
can
resist
the
action
of
fire
and
as
i
read
in
the
books
must
have
been
brought
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
on
almost
every
stone
we
found
the
marks
of
the
mineralogist
s
hammer
and
chisel
the
nineteen
smaller
stones
of
the
inner
circle
are
of
granite
i
who
had
just
come
from
professor
sedgwick
s
cambridge
museum
of
megatheria
and
mastodons
was
ready
to
maintain
that
some
cleverer
elephants
or
mylodonta
had
borne
off
and
laid
these
rocks
one
on
another
only
the
good
beasts
must
have
known
how
to
cut
a
tenon
and
mortise
and
to
smooth
the
surface
of
some
of
the
stones
the
chief
mystery
is
that
any
mystery
should
have
been
allowed
to
settle
on
so
remarkable
a
monument
in
a
country
on
which
all
the
muses
have
kept
their
eyes
now
for
eighteen
hundred
years
we
are
not
yet
too
late
to
learn
much
more
than
is
known
of
this
structure
some
diligent
fellowes
or
layard
will
arrive
stone
by
stone
at
the
whole
history
by
that
exhaustive
british
sense
and
perseverance
so
whimsical
in
its
choice
of
objects
which
leaves
its
own
stonehenge
or
choir
gaur
to
the
rabbits
whilst
it
opens
pyramids
and
uncovers
nineveh
stonehenge
in
virtue
of
the
simplicity
of
its
plan
and
its
good
preservation
is
as
if
new
and
recent
and
a
thousand
years
hence
men
will
thank
this
age
for
the
accurate
history
it
will
yet
eliminate
we
walked
in
and
out
and
took
again
and
again
a
fresh
look
at
the
uncanny
stones
the
old
sphinx
put
our
petty
differences
of
nationality
out
of
sight
to
these
conscious
stones
we
two
pilgrims
were
alike
known
and
near
we
could
equally
well
revere
their
old
british
meaning
my
philosopher
was
subdued
and
gentle
in
this
quiet
house
of
destiny
he
happened
to
say
i
plant
cypresses
wherever
i
go
and
if
i
am
in
search
of
pain
i
can
not
go
wrong
the
spot
the
gray
blocks
and
their
rude
order
which
refuses
to
be
disposed
of
suggested
to
him
the
flight
of
ages
and
the
succession
of
religious
the
old
times
of
england
impress
much
he
reads
little
he
says
in
these
last
years
but
the
volumes
of
which
are
in
the
london
library
he
finds
all
english
history
therein
he
can
see
as
he
reads
the
old
saint
of
iona
sitting
there
and
writing
a
man
to
men
the
show
plainly
that
the
men
of
those
times
believed
in
god
and
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
as
their
abbeys
and
cathedrals
testify
now
even
the
puritanism
is
all
gone
london
is
pagan
he
fancied
that
greater
men
had
lived
in
england
than
any
of
her
writers
and
in
fact
about
the
time
when
those
writers
appeared
the
last
of
these
were
already
gone
we
left
the
mound
in
the
twilight
with
the
design
to
return
the
next
morning
and
coming
back
two
miles
to
our
inn
we
were
met
by
little
showers
and
late
as
it
was
men
and
women
were
out
attempting
to
protect
their
spread
windrows
the
grass
grows
rank
and
dark
in
the
showery
england
at
the
inn
there
was
only
milk
for
one
cup
of
tea
when
we
called
for
more
the
girl
brought
us
three
drops
my
friend
was
annoyed
who
stood
for
the
credit
of
an
english
inn
and
still
more
the
next
morning
by
the
sole
procurable
vehicle
in
which
we
were
to
be
sent
to
wilton
i
engaged
the
local
antiquary
brown
to
go
with
us
to
stonehenge
on
our
way
and
show
us
what
he
knew
of
the
astronomical
and
sacrificial
stones
i
stood
on
the
last
and
he
pointed
to
the
upright
or
rather
inclined
stone
called
the
astronomical
and
bade
me
notice
that
its
top
ranged
with
the
yes
very
well
now
at
the
summer
solstice
the
sun
rises
exactly
over
the
top
of
that
stone
and
at
the
druidical
temple
at
abury
there
is
also
an
astronomical
stone
in
the
same
relative
positions
in
the
silence
of
tradition
this
one
relation
to
science
becomes
an
important
clew
but
we
were
content
to
leave
the
problem
with
the
rocks
was
this
the
giants
dance
which
merlin
brought
from
killaraus
in
ireland
to
be
uther
pendragon
s
monument
to
the
british
nobles
whom
hengist
slaughtered
here
as
geoffrey
of
monmouth
relates
or
was
it
a
roman
work
as
inigo
jones
explained
to
king
james
or
identical
in
design
and
style
with
the
east
indian
temples
of
the
sun
as
davies
in
the
celtic
researches
maintains
of
all
the
writers
stukeley
is
the
best
the
heroic
antiquary
charmed
with
the
geometric
perfections
of
his
ruin
connects
it
with
the
oldest
monuments
and
religion
of
the
world
and
with
the
courage
of
his
tribe
does
not
stick
to
say
the
deity
who
made
the
world
by
the
scheme
of
stonehenge
he
finds
that
the
on
salisbury
plain
stretches
across
the
downs
like
a
line
of
latitude
upon
the
globe
and
the
meridian
line
of
stonehenge
passes
exactly
through
the
middle
of
this
but
here
is
the
high
point
of
the
theory
the
druids
had
the
magnet
laid
their
courses
by
it
their
cardinal
points
in
stonehenge
ambresbury
and
elsewhere
which
vary
a
little
from
true
east
and
west
followed
the
variations
of
the
compass
the
druids
were
phoenicians
the
name
of
the
magnet
is
and
hercules
was
the
god
of
the
phoenicians
hercules
in
the
legend
drew
his
bow
at
the
sun
and
the
gave
him
a
golden
cup
with
which
he
sailed
over
the
ocean
what
was
this
but
a
this
cup
or
little
boat
in
which
the
magnet
was
made
to
float
on
water
and
so
show
the
north
was
probably
its
first
form
before
it
was
suspended
on
a
pin
but
science
was
an
and
as
britain
was
a
phoenician
secret
so
they
kept
their
compass
a
secret
and
it
was
lost
with
the
tyrian
commerce
the
golden
fleece
again
of
jason
was
the
compass
a
bit
of
loadstone
easily
supposed
to
be
the
only
one
in
the
world
and
therefore
naturally
awakening
the
cupidity
and
ambition
of
the
young
heroes
of
a
maritime
nation
to
join
in
an
expedition
to
obtain
possession
of
this
wise
stone
hence
the
fable
that
the
ship
argo
was
loquacious
and
oracular
there
is
also
some
curious
coincidence
in
the
names
apollodorus
makes
the
son
of
who
married
on
hints
like
these
stukeley
builds
again
the
grand
colonnade
into
historic
harmony
and
computing
backward
by
the
known
variations
of
the
compass

the
year
before

for
the
date
of
the

connected
with
stonehenge
are
an
avenue
and
a
the
avenue
is
a
narrow
road
of
raised
earth
extending
yards
in
a
straight
line
from
the
grand
entrance
then
dividing
into
two
branches
which
lead
severally
to
a
row
of
barrows
and
to
the
cursus
an
artificially
formed
flat
tract
of
ground
this
is
half
a
mile
northeast
from
stonehenge
bounded
by
banks
and
ditches
yards
long
by
broad
for
the
difficulty
of
handling
and
carrying
stones
of
this
size
the
like
is
done
in
all
cities
every
day
with
no
other
aid
than
i
chanced
to
see
a
year
ago
men
at
work
on
the
substructure
of
a
house
in
bowdoin
square
in
boston
swinging
a
block
of
granite
of
the
size
of
the
largest
of
the
stonehenge
columns
with
an
ordinary
derrick
the
men
were
common
masons
with
paddies
to
help
nor
did
they
think
they
were
doing
anything
remarkable
i
suppose
there
were
as
good
men
a
thousand
years
ago
and
we
wonder
how
stonehenge
was
built
and
forgotten
after
spending
half
an
hour
on
the
spot
we
set
forth
in
our
over
the
downs
for
wilton
not
suppressing
some
threats
and
evil
omens
on
the
proprietors
for
keeping
these
broad
plains
a
wretched
when
so
many
thousands
of
englishmen
were
hungry
and
wanted
labor
but
i
heard
afterwards
that
it
is
not
an
economy
to
cultivate
this
land
which
only
yields
one
crop
on
being
broken
up
and
is
then
spoiled
we
came
to
wilton
and
to
wilton
hall
the
renowned
seat
of
the
earls
of
pembroke
a
house
known
to
shakspeare
and
massinger
the
frequent
home
of
sir
philip
sidney
where
he
wrote
the
arcadia
where
he
conversed
with
lord
brooke
a
man
of
deep
thought
and
a
poet
who
caused
to
be
engraved
on
his
tombstone
here
lies
fulke
greville
lord
brooke
the
friend
of
sir
philip
sidney
it
is
now
the
property
of
the
earl
of
pembroke
and
the
residence
of
his
brother
sidney
herbert
and
is
esteemed
a
noble
specimen
of
the
english
my
friend
had
a
letter
from
herbert
to
his
housekeeper
and
the
house
was
shown
the
state
is
a
double
cube
thirty
feet
high
by
thirty
wide
by
sixty
feet
long
the
adjoining
room
is
a
single
cube
of
thirty
feet
every
way
although
these
apartments
and
the
long
library
were
full
of
good
family
portraits
vandykes
and
other
and
though
there
were
some
good
pictures
and
a
quadrangle
cloister
full
of
antique
and
modern
statuary
to
which
catalogue
in
hand
did
all
too
much
justice
yet
the
eye
was
still
drawn
to
the
windows
to
a
magnificent
lawn
on
which
grew
the
finest
cedars
in
england
i
had
not
seen
more
charming
grounds
we
went
out
and
walked
over
the
estate
we
crossed
a
bridge
built
by
inigo
jones
over
a
stream
of
which
the
gardener
did
not
know
the
name
alph
watched
the
deer
climbed
to
the
lonely
sculptured
on
a
hill
backed
by
a
wood
came
down
into
the
italian
garden
and
into
a
french
pavilion
garnished
with
french
busts
and
so
again
to
the
house
where
we
found
a
table
laid
for
us
with
bread
meats
peaches
grapes
and
wine
on
leaving
wilton
house
we
took
the
coach
for
salisbury
the
cathedral
which
was
finished
six
hundred
years
ago
has
even
a
spruce
and
modern
air
and
its
spire
is
the
highest
in
england
i
know
not
why
but
i
had
been
more
struck
with
one
of
no
fame
at
coventry
which
rises
three
hundred
feet
from
the
ground
with
the
lightness
of
a
and
not
at
all
implicated
with
the
church
salisbury
is
now
esteemed
the
culmination
of
the
gothic
art
in
england
as
the
buttresses
are
fully
unmasked
and
honestly
detailed
from
the
sides
of
the
pile
the
interior
of
the
cathedral
is
obstructed
by
the
organ
in
the
middle
acting
like
a
screen
i
know
not
why
in
real
architecture
the
hunger
of
the
eye
for
length
of
line
is
so
rarely
gratified
the
rule
of
art
is
that
a
colonnade
is
more
beautiful
the
longer
it
is
and
that
and
the
nave
of
a
church
is
seldom
so
long
that
it
need
be
divided
by
a
screen
we
loitered
in
the
church
outside
the
choir
whilst
service
was
said
whilst
we
listened
to
the
organ
my
friend
remarked
the
music
is
good
and
yet
not
quite
religious
but
somewhat
as
if
a
monk
were
panting
to
some
fine
queen
of
heaven
was
unwilling
and
we
did
not
ask
to
have
the
choir
shown
us
but
returned
to
our
inn
after
seeing
another
old
church
of
the
place
we
passed
in
the
train
clarendon
park
but
could
see
little
but
the
edge
of
a
wood
though
had
wished
to
pay
closer
attention
to
the
birthplace
of
the
decrees
of
clarendon
at
bishopstoke
we
stopped
and
found
who
received
us
in
his
carriage
and
took
us
to
his
house
at
bishops
waltham
on
sunday
we
had
much
discourse
on
a
very
rainy
day
my
friends
ask
whether
there
were
any
americans
any
with
an
american
idea
any
theory
of
the
right
future
of
that
country
thus
challenged
i
bethought
myself
neither
of
caucuses
nor
congress
neither
of
presidents
nor
of
nor
of
such
as
would
make
of
america
another
europe
i
thought
only
of
the
simplest
and
purest
minds
i
said
certainly
yes
but
those
who
hold
it
are
fanatics
of
a
dream
which
i
should
hardly
care
to
relate
to
your
english
ears
to
which
it
might
be
only
ridiculous
and
yet
it
is
the
only
so
i
opened
the
dogma
of
no
government
and
and
anticipated
the
objections
and
the
fun
and
procured
a
kind
of
hearing
for
it
i
said
it
is
true
that
i
have
never
seen
in
any
country
a
man
of
sufficient
valor
to
stand
for
this
truth
and
yet
it
is
plain
to
me
that
no
less
valor
than
this
can
command
my
respect
i
can
easily
see
the
bankruptcy
of
the
vulgar
though
great
men
be
and
t
is
certain
as
god
liveth
the
gun
that
does
not
need
another
gun
the
law
of
love
and
justice
alone
can
effect
a
clean
revolution
i
fancied
that
one
or
two
of
my
anecdotes
made
some
impression
on
and
i
insisted
that
the
manifest
absurdity
of
the
view
to
english
feasibility
could
make
no
difference
to
a
gentleman
that
as
to
our
secure
tenure
of
our
and
spinage
in
london
or
in
boston
the
soul
might
quote
talleyrand
je
n
en
vois
pas
la
as
i
had
thus
taken
in
the
conversation
the
saint
s
part
when
dinner
was
announced
refused
to
go
out
before
me
he
was
altogether
too
wicked
i
planted
my
back
against
the
wall
and
our
host
wittily
rescued
us
from
the
dilemma
by
saying
he
was
the
wickedest
and
would
walk
out
first
then
followed
and
i
went
last
mais
monseigneur
il
faut
que
j
existe
on
the
way
to
winchester
whither
our
host
accompanied
us
in
the
afternoon
my
friends
asked
many
questions
respecting
american
landscape
forests
houses
my
house
for
example
it
is
not
easy
to
answer
these
queries
well
there
i
thought
in
america
lies
nature
sleeping
overgrowing
almost
conscious
too
much
by
half
for
man
in
the
picture
and
so
giving
a
certain
tristesse
like
the
rank
vegetation
of
swamps
and
forests
seen
at
night
steeped
in
dews
and
rains
which
it
loves
and
on
it
man
seems
not
able
to
make
much
impression
there
in
that
great
sloven
continent
in
high
alleghany
pastures
in
the
prairie
still
sleeps
and
murmurs
and
hides
the
great
mother
long
since
driven
away
from
the
trim
and
garden
of
england
and
in
england
i
am
quite
too
sensible
of
this
every
one
is
on
his
good
behavior
and
must
be
dressed
for
dinner
at
six
so
i
put
off
my
friends
with
very
inadequate
details
as
best
i
could
just
before
entering
winchester
we
stopped
at
the
church
of
saint
cross
and
after
looking
through
the
quaint
antiquity
we
demanded
a
piece
of
bread
and
a
draught
of
beer
which
the
founder
henry
de
blois
in
commanded
should
be
given
to
every
one
who
should
ask
it
at
the
gate
we
had
both
from
the
old
couple
who
take
care
of
the
church
some
twenty
people
every
day
they
said
make
the
same
demand
this
hospitality
of
seven
hundred
years
standing
did
not
hinder
from
pronouncing
a
malediction
on
the
priest
who
receives
a
year
that
were
meant
for
the
poor
and
spends
a
pittance
on
this
and
crumbs
in
the
cathedral
i
was
gratified
at
least
by
the
ample
dimensions
the
length
of
line
exceeds
that
of
any
other
english
church
being
feet
by
in
breadth
of
transept
i
think
i
prefer
this
church
to
all
i
have
seen
except
westminster
and
york
here
was
canute
buried
and
here
alfred
the
great
was
crowned
and
buried
and
here
the
saxon
kings
and
later
in
his
own
church
william
of
wykeham
it
is
very
old
part
of
the
crypt
into
which
we
went
down
and
saw
the
saxon
and
norman
arches
of
the
old
church
on
which
the
present
stands
was
built
fourteen
or
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
sharon
turner
says
alfred
was
buried
at
winchester
in
the
abbey
he
had
founded
there
but
his
remains
were
removed
by
henry
to
the
new
abbey
in
the
meadows
at
hyde
on
the
northern
quarter
of
the
city
and
laid
under
the
high
altar
the
building
was
destroyed
at
the
reformation
and
what
is
left
of
alfred
s
body
now
lies
covered
by
modern
buildings
or
buried
in
the
ruins
of
the
old
william
of
wykeham
s
shrine
tomb
was
unlocked
for
us
and
took
hold
of
the
recumbent
statue
s
marble
hands
and
patted
them
affectionately
for
he
rightly
values
the
brave
man
who
built
windsor
and
this
cathedral
and
the
school
here
and
new
college
at
oxford
but
it
was
growing
late
in
the
afternoon
slowly
we
left
the
old
house
and
parting
with
our
host
we
took
the
train
for
london
history
of
the
i
chapter
personal
in
these
comments
on
an
old
journey
now
revised
after
seven
busy
years
have
much
changed
men
and
things
in
england
i
have
abstained
from
reference
to
persons
except
in
the
last
chapter
and
in
one
or
two
cases
where
the
fame
of
the
parties
seemed
to
have
given
the
public
a
property
in
all
that
concerned
them
i
must
further
allow
myself
a
few
notices
if
only
as
an
acknowledgment
of
debts
that
can
not
be
paid
my
journeys
were
cheered
by
so
much
kindness
from
new
friends
that
my
impression
of
the
island
is
bright
with
agreeable
memories
both
of
public
societies
and
of
households
and
what
is
nowhere
better
found
than
in
england
a
cultivated
person
fitly
surrounded
by
a
happy
home
with
honor
love
obedience
troops
of
friends
is
of
all
institutions
the
best
at
the
landing
in
liverpool
i
found
my
manchester
correspondent
awaiting
me
a
gentleman
whose
kind
reception
was
followed
by
a
train
of
friendly
and
effective
attentions
which
never
rested
whilst
i
remained
in
the
country
a
man
of
sense
and
of
letters
the
editor
of
a
powerful
local
journal
he
added
to
solid
virtues
an
infinite
sweetness
and
there
seemed
a
pool
of
honey
about
his
heart
which
lubricated
all
his
speech
and
action
with
fine
jets
of
mead
an
equal
attended
many
later
accidents
of
my
journey
until
the
sincerity
of
english
kindness
ceased
to
surprise
my
visit
fell
in
the
fortunate
days
when
bancroft
was
the
american
minister
in
london
and
at
his
house
or
through
his
good
offices
i
had
easy
access
to
excellent
persons
and
to
privileged
places
at
the
house
of
carlyle
i
met
persons
eminent
in
society
and
in
letters
the
privileges
of
the
athen√¶um
and
of
the
reform
clubs
were
hospitably
opened
to
me
and
i
found
much
advantage
in
the
circles
of
the
geologic
the
antiquarian
and
the
royal
societies
every
day
in
london
gave
me
new
opportunities
of
meeting
men
and
women
who
give
splendor
to
society
i
saw
rogers
hallam
macaulay
milnes
milman
barry
cornwall
dickens
thackeray
tennyson
leigh
hunt
d
israeli
helps
wilkinson
bailey
kenyon
and
forster
the
younger
poets
clough
arnold
and
patmore
and
among
the
men
of
science
robert
brown
owen
sedgwick
faraday
buckland
lyell
de
la
beche
hooker
carpenter
babbage
and
edward
forbes
it
was
my
privilege
also
to
converse
with
miss
baillie
with
lady
morgan
with
jameson
and
somerville
a
finer
hospitality
made
many
private
houses
not
less
known
and
dear
it
is
not
in
distinguished
circles
that
wisdom
and
elevated
characters
are
usually
found
or
if
found
not
confined
thereto
and
my
recollections
of
the
best
hours
go
back
to
private
conversations
in
different
parts
of
the
kingdom
with
persons
little
known
nor
am
i
insensible
to
the
courtesy
which
frankly
opened
to
me
some
noble
mansions
if
i
do
not
adorn
my
page
with
their
names
among
the
privileges
of
london
i
recall
with
pleasure
two
or
three
signal
days
one
at
kew
where
sir
william
hooker
showed
me
all
the
riches
of
the
vast
botanic
garden
one
at
the
museum
where
sir
charles
fellowes
explained
in
detail
the
history
of
his
ionic
and
still
another
on
which
owen
accompanied
my
countryman
and
myself
through
the
hunterian
museum
the
like
frank
hospitality
bent
on
real
service
i
found
among
the
great
and
the
humble
wherever
i
went
in
birmingham
in
oxford
in
leicester
in
nottingham
in
sheffield
in
manchester
in
liverpool
at
edinburgh
through
the
kindness
of
samuel
brown
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
de
quincey
of
lord
jeffrey
of
wilson
of
crowe
of
the
messrs
chambers
and
of
a
man
of
high
character
and
genius
the
painter
david
scott
at
ambleside
in
march
i
was
for
a
couple
of
days
the
guest
of
miss
martineau
then
newly
returned
from
her
egyptian
tour
on
sunday
afternoon
i
accompanied
her
to
rydal
mount
and
as
i
have
recorded
a
visit
to
wordsworth
many
years
before
i
must
not
forget
this
second
interview
we
found
wordsworth
asleep
on
the
sofa
he
was
at
first
silent
and
indisposed
as
an
old
man
suddenly
waked
before
he
had
ended
his
nap
but
soon
became
full
of
talk
on
the
french
news
he
was
nationally
bitter
on
the
french
bitter
on
scotchmen
too
no
scotchman
he
said
can
write
english
he
detailed
the
two
models
on
one
or
the
other
of
which
all
the
sentences
of
the
historian
robertson
are
framed
nor
could
jeffrey
nor
the
edinburgh
reviewers
write
english
nor
can
who
is
a
pest
to
the
english
tongue
incidentally
he
added
gibbon
can
not
write
english
the
wrote
what
would
tell
and
what
would
sell
it
had
however
changed
the
tone
of
its
literary
criticism
from
the
time
when
a
certain
letter
was
written
to
the
editor
by
coleridge
had
the
editor
s
answer
in
her
possession
tennyson
he
thinks
a
right
poetic
genius
though
with
some
affectation
he
had
thought
an
elder
brother
of
tennyson
at
first
the
better
poet
but
must
now
reckon
alfred
the
true
one
in
speaking
of
i
know
not
what
style
he
said
to
be
sure
it
was
the
manner
but
then
you
know
the
matter
always
comes
out
of
the
manner
he
thought
rio
janeiro
the
best
place
in
the
world
for
a
great
capital
city
we
talked
of
english
national
character
i
told
him
it
was
not
creditable
that
no
one
in
all
the
country
knew
anything
of
thomas
taylor
the
platonist
whilst
in
every
american
library
his
translations
are
found
i
said
if
plato
s
republic
were
published
in
england
as
a
new
book
do
you
think
it
would
find
any
readers
he
confessed
it
would
not
and
yet
he
added
after
a
pause
with
that
complacency
which
never
deserts
a
englishman
and
yet
we
have
embodied
it
all
his
opinions
of
french
english
irish
and
scotch
seemed
rashly
formulized
from
little
anecdotes
of
what
had
befallen
himself
and
members
of
his
family
in
a
diligence
or
his
face
sometimes
lighted
up
but
his
conversation
was
not
marked
by
special
force
or
elevation
yet
perhaps
it
is
a
high
compliment
to
the
cultivation
of
the
english
generally
when
we
find
such
a
man
not
distinguished
he
had
a
healthy
look
with
a
face
his
face
corrugated
especially
the
large
nose
miss
martineau
who
lived
near
him
praised
him
to
me
not
for
his
poetry
but
for
thrift
and
economy
for
having
afforded
to
his
country
neighbors
an
example
of
a
modest
household
where
comfort
and
culture
were
secured
without
any
display
she
said
that
in
his
early
housekeeping
at
the
cottage
where
he
first
lived
he
was
accustomed
to
offer
his
friends
bread
and
plainest
fare
if
they
wanted
anything
more
they
must
pay
him
for
their
board
it
was
the
rule
of
the
house
i
replied
that
it
evinced
english
pluck
more
than
any
anecdote
i
knew
a
gentleman
in
the
neighborhood
told
the
story
of
walter
scott
s
once
staying
a
week
with
wordsworth
and
slipping
out
every
day
under
pretence
of
a
walk
to
the
swan
inn
for
a
cold
cut
and
porter
and
one
day
passing
with
wordsworth
the
inn
he
was
betrayed
by
the
landlord
s
asking
him
if
he
had
come
for
his
porter
of
course
this
trait
would
have
another
look
in
london
and
there
you
will
hear
from
different
literary
men
that
wordsworth
had
no
personal
friend
that
he
was
not
amiable
that
he
was
parsimonious
etc
landor
always
generous
says
that
he
never
praised
anybody
a
gentleman
in
london
showed
me
a
watch
that
once
belonged
to
milton
whose
initials
are
engraved
on
its
face
he
said
he
once
showed
this
to
wordsworth
who
took
it
in
one
hand
then
drew
out
his
own
watch
and
held
it
up
with
the
other
before
the
company
but
no
one
making
the
expected
remark
he
put
back
his
own
in
silence
i
do
not
attach
much
importance
to
the
disparagement
of
wordsworth
among
london
scholars
who
reads
him
well
will
know
that
in
following
the
strong
bent
of
his
genius
he
was
careless
of
the
many
careless
also
of
the
few
that
he
should
create
the
taste
by
which
he
is
to
be
enjoyed
he
lived
long
enough
to
witness
the
revolution
he
had
wrought
and
to
see
what
he
foresaw
there
are
torpid
places
in
his
mind
there
is
something
hard
and
sterile
in
his
poetry
want
of
grace
and
variety
want
of
due
catholicity
and
cosmopolitan
scope
he
had
conformities
to
english
politics
and
traditions
he
had
egotistic
puerilities
in
the
choice
and
treatment
of
his
subjects
but
let
us
say
of
him
that
alone
in
his
time
he
treated
the
human
mind
well
and
with
an
absolute
trust
his
adherence
to
his
poetic
creed
rested
on
real
inspirations
the
ode
on
immortality
is
the
mark
which
the
intellect
has
reached
in
this
age
new
means
were
employed
and
new
realms
added
to
the
empire
of
the
muse
by
his
courage
chapter
result
england
is
the
best
of
actual
nations
it
is
no
ideal
framework
it
is
an
old
pile
built
in
different
ages
with
repairs
additions
and
makeshifts
but
you
see
the
poor
best
you
have
got
london
is
the
epitome
of
our
times
and
the
rome
of
teutons
they
stand
in
solid
phalanx
foursquare
to
the
points
of
compass
they
constitute
the
modern
world
they
have
earned
their
and
held
it
through
ages
of
adverse
possession
they
are
well
marked
and
differing
from
other
leading
races
england
is
rome

england
is
not
so
public
in
its
bias
private
life
is
its
place
of
honor
truth

marks
these
men
their
political
conduct
is
not
decided
by
general
views
but
by
internal
intrigues
and
personal
and
family
interest
they
can
not
readily
see
beyond
england
the
history
of
rome
and
greece
when
written
by
their
scholars
degenerates
into
english
party
pamphlets
they
can
not
see
beyond
england
nor
in
england
can
they
transcend
the

of
the

hospitality
england
keeps
open
doors
as
a
trading
country
must
to
all
nations
it
is
one
of
their
fixed
ideas
and
wrathfully
supported
by
their
laws
in
unbroken
sequence
for
a
thousand
years
in
it
was
ordained
that
all
merchants
shall
have
safe
and
secure
conduct
to
go
out
and
come
into
england
and
to
stay
there
and
to
pass
as
well
by

as
by
water
to
buy
and
sell
by
the
ancient
allowed
customs
without
any

toll
except
in

of

or
when

shall
be
of

at

with

it
is
a
statute
and
obliged
hospitality
and
peremptorily
maintained
but
this
had
one
magnificent
effect
it
extends
its
cold
unalterable
courtesy
to
political
exiles
of
every
opinion
and
is
a
fact
which
might
give
additional
light
to
that
portion
of
the
planet
seen
from
the
farthest
star
but
this
perfunctory
hospitality
puts
no
sweetness
into
their
unaccommodating
manners
no
check
on
that
puissant
nationality
which
makes
their
existence
incompatible
with
all
that
is
not
english
what
we
must
say
about
a
nation
is
a
superficial
dealing
with
symptoms
we
can
not
go
deep
enough
into
the
biography
of
the
spirit
who
never
throws
himself
entire
into
one
hero
but
delegates
his
energy
in
parts
or
spasms
to
vicious
and
defective
individuals
but
the
wealth
of
the
source
is
seen
in
the
plenitude
of
english
nature
what
variety
of
power
and
talent
what
facility
and
plenteousness
of
knighthood
lordship
ladyship
royalty
loyalty
what
a
proud
chivalry
is
indicated
in
collins
s
peerage
through
eight
hundred
years
what
dignity
resting
on
what
reality
and
stoutness
what
courage
in

what
sinew
in
labor
what
cunning
workmen
what
inventors
and
engineers
what
seamen
and
pilots
what
clerks
and
scholars
no
one
man
and
no
few
men
can
represent
them
it
is
a
people
of
myriad
personalities
their
is
owing
to
the
advantageous
position
of
the
middle
class
who
are
always
the
source
of
letters
and
science
hence
the
vast
plenty
of
their
√¶sthetic
production
as
they
are
so
they
are
their
colonization
annexes
archipelagoes
and
continents
and
their
speech
seems
destined
to
be
the
universal
language
of
men
i
have
noted
the
reserve
of
power
in
the
english
temperament
in
the
island
they
never
let
out
all
the
length
of
all
the
reins
there
is
no
berserkir
rage
no
abandonment
or
ecstasy
of
will
or
intellect
like
that
of
the
arabs
in
the
time
of
mahomet
or
like
that
which
intoxicated
france
in
but
who
would
see
the
uncoiling
of
that
tremendous
spring
the
explosion
of
their
forces
must
follow
the
swarms
which
pouring
now
for
two
hundred
years
from
the
british
islands
have
sailed
and
rode
and
traded
and
planted
through
all
climates
mainly
following
the
belt
of
empire
the
temperate
zones
carrying
the
saxon
seed
with
its
instinct
for
liberty
and
law
for
arts
and
for
thought
acquiring
under
some
skies
a
more
electric
energy
than
the
native
air
allows
to
the
conquest
of
the
globe
their
colonial
policy
obeying
the
necessities
of
a
vast
empire
has
become
liberal
canada
and
australia
have
been
contented
with
substantial
independence
they
are
expiating
the
wrongs
of
india
by
benefits
first
in
works
for
the
irrigation
of
the
peninsula
and
roads
and
telegraphs
and
secondly
in
the
instruction
of
the
people
to
qualify
them
for
when
the
british
power
shall
be
finally
called
home
their
mind
is
in
a
state
of
arrested
development
a
divine
cripple
like
vulcan
a
blind
like
huber
and
sanderson
they
do
not
occupy
themselves
on
matters
of
general
and
lasting
import
but
on
a
corporeal
civilization
on
goods
that
perish
in
the
using
but
they
read
with
good
intent
and
what
they
learn
they
incarnate
the
english
mind
turns
every
abstraction
it
can
receive
into
a
portable
utensil
or
a
working
institution
such
is
their
tenacity
and
such
their
practical
turn
that
they
hold
all
they
gain
hence
we
say
that
only
the
english
race
can
be
trusted
with
freedom
freedom
which
is
and
dangerous
to
any
but
the
wise
and
robust
the
english
designate
the
kingdoms
emulous
of
free
institutions
as
the
sentimental
nations
their
own
culture
is
not
an
outside
varnish
but
is
thorough
and
secular
in
families
and
the
race
they
are
oppressive
with
their
temperament
and
all
the
more
that
they
are
refined
i
have
sometimes
seen
them
walk
with
my
countrymen
when
i
was
forced
to
allow
them
every
advantage
and
their
companions
seemed
bags
of
bones
there
is
cramp
limitation
in
their
habit
of
thought
sleepy
routine
and
a
tortoise
s
instinct
to
hold
hard
to
the
ground
with
his
claws
lest
he
should
be
thrown
on
his
back
there
is
a
drag
of
inertia
which
resists
reform
in
every
shape
extension
of
suffrage
jewish
franchise
catholic
emancipation
the
abolition
of
slavery
of
impressment
penal
code
and
entails
they
praise
this
drag
under
the
formula
that
it
is
the
excellence
of
the
british
constitution
that
no
law
can
anticipate
the
public
opinion
these
poor
tortoises
must
hold
hard
for
they
feel
no
wings
sprouting
at
their
shoulders
yet
somewhat
divine
warms
at
their
heart
and
waits
a
happier
hour
it
hides
in
their
sturdy
will
will
said
the
old
philosophy
is
the
measure
of
power
and
personality
is
the
token
of
this
race
vult
valde
what
they
do
they
do
with
a
will
you
can
not
account
for
their
success
by
their
christianity
commerce
charter
common
law
parliament
or
letters
but
by
the
contumacious
energy
of
english
with
a
poise
impossible
to
disturb
which
makes
all
these
its
instruments
they
are
slow
and
reticent
and
are
like
a
dull
good
horse
which
lets
every
nag
pass
him
but
with
whip
and
spur
will
run
down
every
racer
in
the
field
they
are
right
in
their
feeling
though
wrong
in
their
speculation
the
feudal
system
survives
in
the
steep
inequality
of
property
and
privilege
in
the
limited
franchise
in
the
social
barriers
which
confine
patronage
and
promotion
to
a
caste
and
still
more
in
the
submissive
ideas
pervading
these
people
the
fagging
of
the
schools
is
repeated
in
the
social
classes
an
englishman
shows
no
mercy
to
those
below
him
in
the
social
scale
as
he
looks
for
none
from
those
above
him
any
forbearance
from
his
superiors
surprises
him
and
they
suffer
in
his
good
opinion
but
the
feudal
system
can
be
seen
with
less
pain
on
large
historical
grounds
it
was
pleaded
in
mitigation
of
the
rotten
borough
that
it
worked
well
that
substantial
justice
was
done
fox
burke
pitt
erskine
wilberforce
sheridan
romilly
or
whatever
national
men
were
by
this
means
sent
to
parliament
when
their
return
by
large
constituencies
would
have
been
doubtful
so
now
we
say
that
the
right
measures
of
england
are
the
men
it
bred
that
it
has
yielded
more
able
men
in
five
hundred
years
than
any
other
nation
and
though
we
must
not
play
providence
and
balance
the
chances
of
producing
ten
great
men
against
the
comfort
of
ten
thousand
mean
men
yet
retrospectively
we
may
strike
the
balance
and
prefer
one
alfred
one
shakspeare
one
milton
one
sidney
one
raleigh
one
wellington
to
a
million
foolish
democrats
the
american
system
is
more
democratic
more
humane
yet
the
american
people
do
not
yield
better
or
more
able
men
or
more
inventions
or
books
or
benefits
than
the
english
congress
is
not
wiser
or
better
than
parliament
france
has
abolished
its
suffocating
old
but
is
not
recently
marked
by
any
more
wisdom
or
virtue
the
power
of
performance
has
not
been
exceeded
the
creation
of
value
the
english
have
given
importance
to
individuals
a
principal
end
and
fruit
of
every
society
every
man
is
allowed
and
encouraged
to
be
what
he
is
and
is
guarded
in
the
indulgence
of
his
whim
magna
charta
said
rushworth
is
such
a
fellow
that
he
will
have
no
sovereign
by
this
general
activity
and
by
this
sacredness
of
individuals
they
have
in
seven
hundred
years
evolved
the
principles
of
freedom
it
is
the
land
of
patriots
martyrs
sages
and
bards
and
if
the
ocean
out
of
which
it
emerged
should
wash
it
away
it
will
be
remembered
as
an
island
famous
for
immortal
laws
for
the
announcements
of
original
right
which
make
the
stone
tables
of
liberty
a
few
days
after
my
arrival
at
manchester
in
november
the
manchester
athen√¶um
gave
its
annual
banquet
in
the
hall
with
other
guests
i
was
invited
to
be
present
and
to
address
the
company
in
looking
over
recently
a
newspaper
report
of
my
remarks
i
incline
to
reprint
it
as
fitly
expressing
the
feeling
with
which
i
entered
england
and
which
agrees
well
enough
with
the
more
deliberate
results
of
better
acquaintance
recorded
in
the
foregoing
pages
sir
archibald
alison
the
historian
presided
and
opened
the
meeting
with
a
speech
he
was
followed
by
cobden
lord
brackley
and
others
among
whom
was
cruikshank
one
of
the
contributors
to
punch
dickens
s
letter
of
apology
for
his
absence
was
read
jerrold
who
had
been
announced
did
not
appear
on
being
introduced
to
the
meeting
i
said
chairman
and
gentlemen
it
is
pleasant
to
me
to
meet
this
great
and
brilliant
company
and
doubly
pleasant
to
see
the
faces
of
so
many
distinguished
persons
on
this
platform
but
i
have
known
all
these
persons
already
when
i
was
at
home
they
were
as
near
to
me
as
they
are
to
you
the
arguments
of
the
league
and
its
leader
are
known
to
all
the
friends
of
free
trade
the
gayeties
and
genius
the
political
the
social
the
parietal
wit
of
punch
go
duly
every
fortnight
to
every
boy
and
girl
in
boston
and
new
york
sir
when
i
came
to
sea
i
found
the
history
of
europe
on
the
ship
s
cabin
table
the
property
of
the
captain
a
sort
of
programme
or
to
tell
the
seafaring
what
he
shall
find
on
his
landing
here
and
as
for
dombey
sir
there
is
no
land
where
paper
exists
to
print
on
where
it
is
not
found
no
man
who
can
read
that
does
not
read
it
and
if
he
can
not
he
finds
some
charitable
pair
of
eyes
that
can
and
hears
it
by
sir
alison
but
these
things
are
not
for
me
to
say
these
compliments
though
true
would
better
come
from
one
who
felt
and
understood
these
merits
more
i
am
not
here
to
exchange
civilities
with
you
but
rather
to
speak
of
that
which
i
am
sure
interests
these
gentlemen
more
than
their
own
praises
of
that
which
is
good
in
holidays
and
the
same
in
one
century
and
in
another
century
that
which
lures
a
solitary
american
in
the
woods
with
the
wish
to
see
england
is
the
moral
peculiarity
of
the
saxon
race
its
commanding
sense
of
right
and
wrong
the
love
and
devotion
to
that
this
is
the
imperial
trait
which
arms
them
with
the
sceptre
of
the
globe
it
is
this
which
lies
at
the
foundation
of
that
aristocratic
character
which
certainly
wanders
into
strange
vagaries
so
that
its
origin
is
often
lost
sight
of
but
which
if
it
should
lose
this
would
find
itself
paralyzed
and
in
trade
and
in
the
mechanic
s
shop
gives
that
honesty
in
performance
that
thoroughness
and
solidity
of
work
which
is
a
national
characteristic
this
conscience
is
one
element
and
the
other
is
that
loyal
adhesion
that
habit
of
friendship
that
homage
of
man
to
man
running
through
all
classes
the
electing
of
worthy
persons
to
a
certain
fraternity
to
acts
of
kindness
and
warm
and
stanch
support
from
year
to
year
from
youth
to
age
which
is
alike
lovely
and
honorable
to
those
who
render
and
those
who
receive
it
which
stands
in
strong
contrast
with
the
superficial
attachments
of
other
races
their
excessive
courtesy
and
connection
you
will
think
me
very
pedantic
gentlemen
but
holiday
though
it
be
i
have
not
the
smallest
interest
in
any
holiday
except
as
it
celebrates
real
and
not
pretended
joys
and
i
think
it
just
in
this
time
of
gloom
and
commercial
disaster
of
affliction
and
beggary
in
these
districts
that
on
these
very
accounts
i
speak
of
you
should
not
fail
to
keep
your
literary
anniversary
i
seem
to
hear
you
say
that
for
all
that
is
come
and
gone
yet
we
will
not
reduce
by
one
chaplet
or
one
the
braveries
of
our
annual
feast
for
i
must
tell
you
i
was
given
to
understand
in
my
childhood
that
the
british
island
from
which
my
forefathers
came
was
no
no
paradise
of
serene
sky
and
roses
and
music
and
merriment
all
the
year
round
no
but
a
cold
foggy
mournful
country
where
nothing
grew
well
in
the
open
air
but
robust
men
and
virtuous
women
and
these
of
a
wonderful
fibre
and
endurance
that
their
best
parts
were
slowly
revealed
their
virtues
did
not
come
out
until
they
quarrelled
they
did
not
strike
twelve
the
first
time
good
lovers
good
haters
and
you
could
know
little
about
them
till
you
had
seen
them
long
and
little
good
of
them
till
you
had
seen
them
in
action
that
in
prosperity
they
were
moody
and
dumpish
but
in
adversity
they
were
grand
is
it
not
true
sir
that
the
wise
ancients
did
not
praise
the
ship
parting
with
flying
colors
from
the
port
but
only
that
brave
sailer
which
came
back
with
torn
sheets
and
battered
sides
stript
of
her
banners
but
having
ridden
out
the
storm
and
so
gentlemen
i
feel
in
regard
to
this
aged
england
with
the
possessions
honors
and
trophies
and
also
with
the
infirmities
of
a
thousand
years
gathering
around
her
irretrievably
committed
as
she
now
is
to
many
old
customs
which
can
not
be
suddenly
changed
pressed
upon
by
the
transitions
of
trade
and
new
and
all
incalculable
modes
fabrics
arts
machines
and
competing
populations
i
see
her
not
dispirited
not
weak
but
well
remembering
that
she
has
seen
dark
days
before
indeed
with
a
kind
of
instinct
that
she
sees
a
little
better
in
a
cloudy
day
and
that
in
storm
of
battle
and
calamity
she
has
a
secret
vigor
and
a
pulse
like
a
cannon
i
see
her
in
her
old
age
not
decrepit
but
young
and
still
daring
to
believe
in
her
power
of
endurance
and
expansion
seeing
this
i
say
all
hail
mother
of
nations
mother
of
heroes
with
strength
still
equal
to
the
time
still
wise
to
entertain
and
swift
to
execute
the
policy
which
the
mind
and
heart
of
mankind
require
in
the
present
hour
and
thus
only
hospitable
to
the
foreigner
and
truly
a
home
to
the
thoughtful
and
generous
who
are
born
in
the
soil
so
be
it
so
let
it
be
if
it
be
not
so
if
the
courage
of
england
goes
with
the
chances
of
a
commercial
crisis
i
will
go
back
to
the
capes
of
massachusetts
and
my
own
indian
stream
and
say
to
my
countrymen
the
old
race
are
all
gone
and
the
elasticity
