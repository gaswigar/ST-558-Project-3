preface
in
preparing
the
following
abridgment
of
my
larger
work
the
principles
of
psychology
my
chief
aim
has
been
to
make
it
more
directly
available
for
use
for
this
purpose
i
have
omitted
several
whole
chapters
and
rewritten
others
i
have
left
out
all
the
polemical
and
historical
matter
all
the
metaphysical
discussions
and
purely
speculative
passages
most
of
the
quotations
all
the
and
i
trust
all
the
impertinences
of
the
larger
work
leaving
to
the
teacher
the
choice
of
orally
restoring
as
much
of
this
material
as
may
seem
to
him
good
along
with
his
own
remarks
on
the
topics
successively
studied
knowing
how
ignorant
the
average
student
is
of
physiology
i
have
added
brief
chapters
on
the
various
senses
in
this
shorter
work
the
general
point
of
view
which
i
have
adopted
as
that
of
science
has
i
imagine
gained
in
clearness
by
its
extrication
from
so
much
critical
matter
and
its
more
simple
and
dogmatic
statement
about
two
fifths
of
the
volume
is
either
new
or
rewritten
the
rest
is
and
paste
i
regret
to
have
been
unable
to
supply
chapters
on
pleasure
and
pain
Ã¦sthetics
and
the
moral
sense
possibly
the
defect
may
be
made
up
in
a
later
edition
if
such
a
thing
should
ever
be
demanded
i
can
not
forbear
taking
advantage
of
this
preface
to
make
a
statement
about
the
composition
of
the
of
psychology
my
critics
in
the
main
have
been
so
indulgent
that
i
must
cordially
thank
them
but
they
have
been
unanimous
in
one
reproach
namely
that
my
order
of
chapters
is
planless
and
unnatural
and
in
one
charitable
excuse
for
this
namely
that
the
work
being
largely
a
collection
of
could
not
be
expected
to
show
as
much
system
as
a
treatise
cast
in
a
single
mould
both
the
reproach
and
the
excuse
misapprehend
the
facts
of
the
case
the
order
of
composition
is
doubtless
unshapely
or
it
would
not
be
found
so
by
so
many
but
planless
it
is
not
for
i
deliberately
followed
what
seemed
to
me
a
good
pedagogic
order
in
proceeding
from
the
more
concrete
mental
aspects
with
which
we
are
best
acquainted
to
the
elements
which
we
naturally
come
to
know
later
by
way
of
abstraction
the
opposite
order
of
the
mind
out
of
its
of
composition
has
the
merit
of
expository
elegance
and
gives
a
neatly
subdivided
table
of
contents
but
it
often
purchases
these
advantages
at
the
cost
of
reality
and
truth
i
admit
that
my
order
was
stumblingly
carried
out
but
this
again
was
in
consequence
of
what
i
thought
were
pedagogic
necessities
on
the
whole
in
spite
of
my
critics
i
venture
still
to
think
that
the
form
charged
upon
the
book
is
more
apparent
than
profound
and
that
we
really
gain
a
more
living
understanding
of
the
mind
by
keeping
our
attention
as
long
as
possible
upon
our
entire
conscious
states
as
they
are
concretely
given
to
us
than
by
the
study
of
their
comminuted
this
last
is
the
study
of
artificial
abstractions
not
of
natural
things
but
whether
the
critics
are
right
or
i
am
on
this
first
point
the
critics
are
wrong
about
the
relation
of
the
to
the
book
with
a
single
exception
all
the
chapters
were
written
for
the
book
and
then
by
an
some
of
them
were
sent
to
magazines
because
the
completion
of
the
whole
work
seemed
so
distant
my
lack
of
capacity
has
doubtless
been
great
but
the
charge
of
not
having
taken
the
utmost
pains
according
to
my
lights
in
the
composition
of
the
volumes
can
not
justly
be
laid
at
my
door

chapter

introductory
definition
of
may
be
best
given
in
the
words
of
professor
ladd
as
the
and
explanation
of
states
of
consciousness
as
by
states
of
consciousness
are
meant
such
things
as
sensations
desires
emotions
cognitions
reasonings
decisions
volitions
and
the
like
their
must
of
course
include
the
study
of
their
causes
conditions
and
immediate
consequences
so
far
as
these
can
be
ascertained
is
to
be
treated
as
a
natural
in
this
book
this
requires
a
word
of
commentary
most
thinkers
have
a
faith
that
at
bottom
there
is
but
one
science
of
all
things
and
that
until
all
is
known
no
one
thing
can
be
completely
known
such
a
science
if
realized
would
be
philosophy
meanwhile
it
is
far
from
being
realized
and
instead
of
it
we
have
a
lot
of
beginnings
of
knowledge
made
in
different
places
and
kept
separate
from
each
other
merely
for
practical
convenience
sake
until
with
later
growth
they
may
run
into
one
body
of
truth
these
provisional
beginnings
of
learning
we
call
sciences
in
the
plural
in
order
not
to
be
unwieldy
every
such
science
has
to
stick
to
its
own
problems
and
to
ignore
all
others
every
science
thus
accepts
certain
data
unquestioningly
leaving
it
to
the
other
parts
of
philosophy
to
scrutinize
their
significance
and
truth
all
the
natural
sciences
for
example
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
farther
reflection
leads
to
idealism
assume
that
a
world
of
matter
exists
altogether
independently
of
the
perceiving
mind
mechanical
science
assumes
this
matter
to
have
and
to
exert
defining
these
terms
merely
phenomenally
and
not
troubling
itself
about
certain
unintelligibilities
which
they
present
on
nearer
reflection
motion
similarly
is
assumed
by
mechanical
science
to
exist
independently
of
the
mind
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
involved
in
the
assumption
so
physics
assumes
atoms
action
at
a
distance
uncritically
chemistry
uncritically
adopts
all
the
data
of
physics
and
physiology
adopts
those
of
chemistry
psychology
as
a
natural
science
deals
with
things
in
the
same
partial
and
provisional
way
in
addition
to
the
world
with
all
its
determinations
which
the
other
sciences
of
nature
assume
she
assumes
additional
data
peculiarly
her
own
and
leaves
it
to
more
developed
parts
of
philosophy
to
test
their
ulterior
significance
and
truth
these
data
are
and
or
whatever
other
names
transitory
of
may
be
known
by
by
these
states
of
consciousness
of
other
things
these
things
may
be
material
objects
and
events
or
other
states
of
mind
the
material
objects
may
be
either
near
or
distant
in
time
and
space
and
the
states
of
mind
may
be
those
of
other
people
or
of
the
thinker
himself
at
some
other
time
how
one
thing
know
another
is
the
problem
of
what
is
called
the
theory
of
knowledge
how
such
a
thing
as
a
of
mind
can
be
at
all
is
the
problem
of
what
has
been
called
rational
as
distinguished
from
empirical
psychology
the
truth
about
states
of
mind
can
not
be
known
until
both
theory
of
knowledge
and
rational
psychology
have
said
their
say
meanwhile
an
immense
amount
of
provisional
truth
about
them
can
be
got
together
which
will
work
in
with
the
larger
truth
and
be
interpreted
by
it
when
the
proper
time
arrives
such
a
provisional
body
of
propositions
about
states
of
mind
and
about
the
cognitions
which
they
enjoy
is
what
i
mean
by
psychology
considered
as
a
natural
science
on
any
ulterior
theory
of
matter
mind
and
knowledge
the
facts
and
laws
of
psychology
thus
understood
will
have
their
value
if
critics
find
that
this
point
of
view
cuts
things
too
arbitrarily
short
they
must
not
blame
the
book
which
confines
itself
to
that
point
of
view
rather
must
they
go
on
themselves
to
complete
it
by
their
deeper
thought
incomplete
statements
are
often
practically
necessary
to
go
beyond
the
usual
assumptions
in
the
present
case
would
require
not
a
volume
but
a
shelfful
of
volumes
and
by
the
present
author
such
a
shelfful
could
not
be
written
at
all
let
it
also
be
added
that
human
mind
is
all
that
can
be
touched
in
this
book
although
the
mental
life
of
lower
creatures
has
been
examined
into
of
late
years
with
some
success
we
have
no
space
for
its
consideration
here
and
can
only
allude
to
its
manifestations
incidentally
when
they
throw
light
upon
our
own
facts
can
not
be
properly
studied
apart
from
the
physical
environment
of
which
they
take
the
great
fault
of
the
older
rational
psychology
was
to
set
up
the
soul
as
an
absolute
spiritual
being
with
certain
faculties
of
its
own
by
which
the
several
activities
of
remembering
imagining
reasoning
willing
were
explained
almost
without
reference
to
the
peculiarities
of
the
world
with
which
these
activities
deal
but
the
richer
insight
of
modern
days
perceives
that
our
inner
faculties
are
in
advance
to
the
features
of
the
world
in
which
we
dwell
adapted
i
mean
so
as
to
secure
our
safety
and
prosperity
in
its
midst
not
only
are
our
capacities
for
forming
new
habits
for
remembering
sequences
and
for
abstracting
general
properties
from
things
and
associating
their
usual
consequences
with
them
exactly
the
faculties
needed
for
steering
us
in
this
world
of
mixed
variety
and
uniformity
but
our
emotions
and
instincts
are
adapted
to
very
special
features
of
that
world
in
the
main
if
a
phenomenon
is
important
for
our
welfare
it
interests
and
excites
us
the
first
time
we
come
into
its
presence
dangerous
things
fill
us

in

which
this

as

have

of

they

so
far
be
said
to
be
conclusive
have
at
least
refreshed
and
enriched
the
whole
subject
and
brought
all
sorts
of
new
questions
to
the
light
the
chief
result
of
all
this
more
modern
view
is
the
gradually
growing
conviction
that
life
is
primarily
that
is
to
say
that
our
various
ways
of
feeling
and
thinking
have
grown
to
be
what
they
are
because
of
their
utility
in
shaping
our
on
the
outer
world
on
the
whole
few
recent
formulas
have
done
more
service
in
psychology
than
the
spencerian
one
that
the
essence
of
mental
life
and
bodily
life
are
one
namely
adjustment
of
inner
to
outer
relations
the
adjustment
is
to
immediately
present
objects
in
lower
animals
and
in
infants
it
is
to
objects
more
and
more
remote
in
time
and
space
and
inferred
by
means
of
more
and
more
complex
and
exact
processes
of
reasoning
when
the
grade
of
mental
development
grows
more
advanced
primarily
then
and
fundamentally
the
mental
life
is
for
the
sake
of
action
of
a
preservative
sort
secondarily
and
incidentally
it
does
many
other
things
and
may
even
when
ill
lead
to
its
destruction
psychology
taken
in
the
widest
way
ought
to
study
every
sort
of
mental
activity
the
useless
and
harmful
sorts
as
well
as
that
which
is
but
the
study
of
the
harmful
in
mental
life
has
been
made
the
subject
of
a
special
branch
called
the
science
of
insanity
and
the
study
of
the
useless
is
made
over
to
Ã¦sthetics
and
psychiatry
will
receive
no
special
notice
in
this
book
mental
no
matter
what
their
character
as
regards
utility
may
be
followed
by
bodily
activity
of
some
they
lead
to
inconspicuous
changes
in
breathing
circulation
general
muscular
tension
and
glandular
or
other
visceral
activity
even
if
they
do
not
lead
to
conspicuous
movements
of
the
muscles
of
voluntary
life
not
only
certain
particular
states
of
mind
then
such
as
those
called
volitions
for
example
but
states
of
mind
as
such
states
of
mind
even
mere
thoughts
and
feelings
are
in
their
consequences
this
will
be
made
manifest
in
detail
as
our
study
advances
meanwhile
let
it
be
set
down
as
one
of
the
fundamental
facts
of
the
science
with
which
we
are
engaged
it
was
said
above
that
the
of
states
of
consciousness
must
be
studied
immediate
condition
of
a
state
of
consciousness
is
an
activity
of
some
sort
in
the
cerebral
this
proposition
is
supported
by
so
many
pathological
facts
and
laid
by
physiologists
at
the
base
of
so
many
of
their
reasonings
that
to
the
medically
educated
mind
it
seems
almost
axiomatic
it
would
be
hard
however
to
give
any
short
and
peremptory
proof
of
the
unconditional
dependence
of
mental
action
upon
neural
change
that
a
general
and
usual
amount
of
dependence
exists
can
not
possibly
be
ignored
one
has
only
to
consider
how
quickly
consciousness
may
be
so
far
as
we
know
abolished
by
a
blow
on
the
head
by
rapid
loss
of
blood
by
an
epileptic
discharge
by
a
full
dose
of
alcohol
opium
ether
or
nitrous
oxide
or
how
easily
it
may
be
altered
in
quality
by
a
smaller
dose
of
any
of
these
agents
or
of
others
or
by
a
fever
to
see
how
at
the
mercy
of
bodily
happenings
our
spirit
is
a
little
stoppage
of
the
a
swallow
of
cathartic
medicine
a
cup
of
strong
coffee
at
the
proper
moment
will
entirely
overturn
for
the
time
a
man
views
of
life
our
moods
and
resolutions
are
more
determined
by
the
condition
of
our
circulation
than
by
our
logical
grounds
whether
a
man
shall
be
a
hero
or
a
coward
is
a
matter
of
his
temporary
in
many
kinds
of
insanity
though
by
no
means
in
all
distinct
alterations
of
the
have
been
found
destruction
of
certain
definite
portions
of
the
cerebral
hemispheres
involves
losses
of
memory
and
of
acquired
motor
faculty
of
quite
determinate
sorts
to
which
we
shall
revert
again
under
the
title
of
taking
all
such
facts
together
the
simple
and
radical
conception
dawns
upon
the
mind
that
mental
action
may
be
uniformly
and
absolutely
a
function
of
varying
as
the
latter
varies
and
being
to
the
as
effect
to
cause
conception
is
the
hypothesis
which
underlies
all
the
psychology
of
recent
and
it
will
be
the
working
hypothesis
of
this
book
taken
thus
absolutely
it
may
possibly
be
too
sweeping
a
statement
of
what
in
reality
is
only
a
partial
truth
but
the
only
way
to
make
sure
of
its
unsatisfactoriness
is
to
apply
it
seriously
to
every
possible
case
that
can
turn
up
to
work
an
hypothesis
all
it
is
worth
is
the
real
and
often
the
only
way
to
prove
its
insufficiency
i
shall
therefore
assume
without
scruple
at
the
outset
that
the
uniform
correlation
of
with
is
a
law
of
nature
the
interpretation
of
the
law
in
detail
will
best
show
where
its
facilities
and
where
its
difficulties
lie
to
some
readers
such
an
assumption
will
seem
like
the
most
unjustifiable
materialism
in
one
sense
it
doubtless
is
materialism
it
puts
the
higher
at
the
mercy
of
the
lower
but
although
we
affirm
that
the
to
of
thought
is
a
consequence
of
mechanical
laws
for
according
to
another
hypothesis
that
namely
of
physiology
the
laws
of
are
at
bottom
mechanical
laws
we
do
not
in
the
least
explain
the
of
thought
by
affirming
this
dependence
and
in
that
latter
sense
our
proposition
is
not
materialism
the
authors
who
most
unconditionally
affirm
the
dependence
of
our
thoughts
on
our
brain
to
be
a
fact
are
often
the
loudest
to
insist
that
the
fact
is
inexplicable
and
that
the
intimate
essence
of
consciousness
can
never
be
rationally
accounted
for
by
any
material
cause
it
will
doubtless
take
several
generations
of
psychologists
to
test
the
hypothesis
of
dependence
with
anything
like
minuteness
the
books
which
postulate
it
will
be
to
some
extent
on
conjectural
ground
but
the
student
will
remember
that
the
sciences
constantly
have
to
take
these
risks
and
habitually
advance
by
zig
zagging
from
one
absolute
formula
to
another
which
corrects
it
by
going
too
far
the
other
way
at
present
psychology
is
on
the
materialistic
tack
and
ought
in
the
interests
of
ultimate
success
to
be
allowed
full
headway
even
by
those
who
are
certain
she
will
never
fetch
the
port
without
putting
down
the
helm
once
more
the
only
thing
that
is
perfectly
certain
is
that
when
taken
up
into
the
total
body
of
philosophy
the
formulas
of
psychology
will
appear
with
a
very
different
meaning
from
that
which
they
suggest
so
long
as
they
are
studied
from
the
point
of
view
of
an
abstract
and
truncated
science
however
practically
necessary
and
indispensable
their
study
from
such
a
provisional
point
of
view
may
be
divisions
of
so
far
as
possible
then
we
are
to
study
states
of
consciousness
in
correlation
with
their
probable
neural
conditions
now
the
nervous
system
is
well
understood
to
be
nothing
but
a
machine
for
receiving
impressions
and
discharging
reactions
preservative
to
the
individual
and
his
kind
so
much
of
physiology
the
reader
will
surely
know
anatomically
therefore
the
nervous
system
falls
into
three
main
divisions
comprising
the
fibres
which
carry
currents
in
the
organs
of
central
redirection
of
them
and
the
fibres
which
carry
them
out
functionally
we
have
sensation
central
reflection
and
motion
to
correspond
to
these
anatomical
divisions
in
psychology
we
may
divide
our
work
according
to
a
similar
scheme
and
treat
successively
of
three
fundamental
conscious
processes
and
their
conditions
the
first
will
be
sensation
the
second
will
be
cerebration
or
intellection
the
third
will
be
the
tendency
to
action
much
vagueness
results
from
this
division
but
it
has
practical
conveniences
for
such
a
book
as
this
and
they
may
be
allowed
to
prevail
over
whatever
objections
may
be
urged
chapter
ii
sensation
in
general
are
the
only
agents
which
normally
affect
the
the
human
are
surrounded
by
many
dense
wrappings
of
which
the
effect
is
to
protect
them
from
the
direct
action
of
the
forces
of
the
outer
world
the
hair
the
thick
skin
of
the
scalp
the
skull
and
two
membranes
at
least
one
of
them
a
tough
one
surround
the
brain
and
this
organ
moreover
like
the
spinal
cord
is
bathed
by
a
serous
fluid
in
which
it
floats
suspended
under
these
circumstances
the
only
things
that
can
to
the
brain
are
the
dullest
and
feeblest
mechanical
jars
changes
in
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
and
currents
running
in
through
the
afferent
or
centripetal
nerves
the
mechanical
jars
are
usually
ineffective
the
effects
of
the
are
usually
transient
the
on
the
contrary
produce
consequences
of
the
most
vital
sort
both
at
the
moment
of
their
arrival
and
later
through
the
invisible
paths
of
escape
which
they
plough
in
the
substance
of
the
organ
and
which
as
we
believe
remain
as
more
or
less
permanent
features
of
its
structure
modifying
its
action
throughout
all
future
time
afferent
nerve
comes
from
a
determinate
part
of
the
periphery
and
is
played
upon
and
excited
to
its
inward
activity
by
a
particular
force
of
the
outer
usually
it
is
insensible
to
other
forces
thus
the
optic
nerves
are
not
impressible
by
nor
those
of
the
skin
by
the
lingual
nerve
is
not
excited
by
aromatic
effluvia
the
auditory
nerve
is
unaffected
by
heat
each
selects
from
the
vibrations
of
the
outer
world
some
one
rate
to
which
it
responds
exclusively
the
result
is
that
our
sensations
form
a
discontinuous
series
broken
by
enormous
gaps
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
order
of
vibrations
in
the
outer
world
is
anything
like
as
interrupted
as
the
order
of
our
sensations
between
the
quickest
audible
vibrations
a
second
at
the
outside
and
the
slowest
sensible
which
number
probably
billions
nature
must
somewhere
have
realized
innumerable
intermediary
rates
which
we
have
no
nerves
for
perceiving
the
process
in
the
themselves
is
very
likely
the
same
or
much
the
same
in
all
the
different
nerves
it
is
the
but
the
current
is
by
one
order
of
outer
vibrations
in
the
retina
and
in
the
ear
for
example
by
another
this
is
due
to
the
different
with
which
the
several
afferent
nerves
are
armed
just
as
we
arm
ourselves
with
a
spoon
to
pick
up
soup
and
with
a
fork
to
pick
up
meat
so
our
arm
themselves
with
one
sort
of
to
pick
up
with
another
to
pick
up
the
terminal
apparatus
always
consists
of
modified
epithelial
cells
with
which
the
fibre
is
continuous
the
fibre
itself
is
not
directly
excitable
by
the
outer
agent
which
impresses
the
terminal
organ
the
optic
fibres
are
unmoved
by
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
a
cutaneous
may
be
touched
with
ice
without
feeling
cold
the
fibres
are
mere
transmitters
the
terminal
organs
are
so
many
imperfect
telephones
into
which
the
material
world
speaks
and
each
of
which
takes
up
but
a
portion
of
what
it
says
the
at
the
fibres
central
end
are
as
many
others
at
which
the
mind
listens
to
the
call
energies
of
the
various
parts
of
the
to
a
certain
extent
anatomists
have
traced
definitely
the
paths
which
the
sensory
follow
after
their
entrance
into
the
centres
as
far
as
their
termination
in
the
gray
matter
of
the
cerebral
convolutions
it
will
be
shown
on
a
later
page
that
the
consciousness
which
accompanies
the
excitement
of
this
gray
matter
varies
from
one
portion
of
it
to
another
it
is
consciousness
of
things
seen
when
the
occipital
lobes
and
of
things
heard
when
the
upper
part
of
the
temporal
lobes
share
in
the
excitement
each
region
of
the
cerebral
cortex
responds
to
the
stimulation
which
its
afferent
fibres
bring
to
it
in
a
manner
with
which
a
peculiar
quality
of
feeling
seems
invariably
correlated
this
is
what
has
been
called
the
law
of
energies
in
the
nervous
system
of
course
we
are
without
even
a
conjectural
explanation
of
the
of
such
a
law
psychologists
as
lewes
wundt
rosenthal
goldscheider
etc
have
debated
a
good
deal
as
to
whether
the
specific
quality
of
the
feeling
depends
solely
on
the
stimulated
in
the
cortex
or
on
the
of
which
the
nerve
pours
in
doubtless
the
sort
of
outer
force
habitually
impinging
on
the
gradually
modifies
the
the
sort
of
commotion
received
from
the
modifies
the
fibre
and
the
sort
of
current
a
fibre
pours
into
the
cortical
centre
modifies
the
centre
the
modification
of
the
centre
in
turn
though
no
man
can
guess
how
or
why
seems
to
modify
the
resultant
consciousness
but
these
adaptive
modifications
must
be
excessively
slow
and
as
matters
actually
stand
in
any
adult
individual
it
is
safe
to
say
that
more
than
anything
else
the
excited
in
his
cortex
decides
what
kind
of
thing
he
shall
feel
whether
we
press
the
retina
or
prick
cut
pinch
or
galvanize
the
living
optic
nerve
the
subject
always
feels
flashes
of
light
since
the
ultimate
result
of
our
operations
is
to
stimulate
the
cortex
of
his
occipital
region
our
habitual
ways
of
feeling
outer
things
thus
depend
on
which
convolutions
happen
to
be
connected
with
the
particular
which
those
things
impress
we
the
sunshine
and
the
fire
simply
because
the
only
peripheral
susceptible
of
taking
up
the
which
these
objects
radiate
excites
those
particular
fibres
which
run
to
the
centres
of
sight
if
we
could
interchange
the
inward
connections
we
should
feel
the
world
in
altogether
new
ways
if
for
instance
we
could
splice
the
outer
extremity
of
our
optic
nerves
to
our
ears
and
that
of
our
auditory
nerves
to
our
eyes
we
should
hear
the
lightning
and
see
the
thunder
see
the
symphony
and
hear
the
conductor
movements
such
hypotheses
as
these
form
a
good
training
for
neophytes
in
the
idealistic
philosophy
distinguished
from
it
is
impossible
rigorously
to
a
sensation
and
in
the
actual
life
of
consciousness
sensations
popularly
so
called
and
perceptions
merge
into
each
other
by
insensible
degrees
all
we
can
say
is
that
we
mean
by
sensations
first
in
the
way
of
they
are
the
results
upon
consciousness
of
as
they
enter
the
brain
and
before
they
have
awakened
any
suggestions
or
associations
with
past
experience
but
it
is
obvious
that
immediate
sensations
can
only
be
realized
in
the
earliest
days
of
they
are
all
but
impossible
to
adults
with
memories
and
stores
of
associations
acquired
prior
to
all
impressions
on
the
brain

plunged
in
deep
sleep
and
consciousness
is
practically
even
the
first
weeks
after
birth
are
passed
in
almost
unbroken
sleep
by
human
infants
it
takes
a
strong
message
from
the
to
break
this
slumber
in
a
brain
this
gives
rise
to
an
absolutely
pure
sensation
but
the
experience
leaves
its
touch
on
the
matter
of
the
convolutions
and
the
next
impression
which
a
transmits
produces
a
cerebral
reaction
in
which
the
awakened
vestige
of
the
last
impression
plays
its
part
another
sort
of
feeling
and
a
higher
grade
of
cognition
are
the
consequence
the
object
mingle
with
the
awareness
of
its
mere
sensible
presence
we
name
it
class
it
compare
it
utter
propositions
concerning
it
and
the
complication
of
the
possible
consciousness
which
an
incoming
current
may
arouse
goes
on
increasing
to
the
end
of
life
in
general
this
higher
consciousness
about
things
is
called
perception
the
mere
inarticulate
feeling
of
their
presence
is
sensation
so
far
as
we
have
it
at
all
to
some
degree
we
seem
able
to
lapse
into
this
inarticulate
feeling
at
moments
when
our
attention
is
entirely
dispersed
are
a
sensation
is
thus
an
abstraction
seldom
realized
by
itself
and
the
object
which
a
sensation
knows
is
an
abstract
object
which
can
not
exist
alone
qualities
are
the
objects
of
the
sensations
of
the

aware
of
the
of

those
of
the

or
etc
from
all
the
organs
of
the
body
currents
may
come
which
reveal
to
us
the
quality
of
and
to
a
certain
extent
that

such
qualities
as
are
supposed
to
be
felt
through
the
coÃ¶peration
of
muscular
sensations
with

of

the
geometrical
qualities
of

on
the
other
hand
their
etc
so
far
as
we
discriminate
and
identify
them
are
by
most
psychologists
supposed
to
be
impossible
without
the
evocation
of
memories
from
the
past
and
the
cognition
of
these
attributes
is
thus
considered
to
exceed
the
power
of
sensation
pure
and
simple
of
acquaintance
and
about
sensation
thus
considered
differs
from
perception
only
in
the
extreme
simplicity
of
its
object
or
content
its
object
being
a
simple
quality
is
sensibly
and
its
function
is
that
of
mere
with
this
homogeneous
seeming
fact
perception
function
on
the
other
hand
is
that
of
knowing
something
the
fact
but
we
must
know
fact
we
mean
all
the
while
and
the
various
are
what
sensations
give
our
earliest
thoughts
are
almost
exclusively
sensational
they
give
us
a
set
of
or
or
of
subjects
of
discourse
in
other
words
with
their
relations
not
yet
brought
out
the
first
time
we
see
in
condillac
phrase
we
it
rather
than
see
it
but
all
our
later
optical
knowledge
is
about
what
this
experience
gives
and
though
we
were
struck
blind
from
that
first
moment
our
scholarship
in
the
subject
would
lack
no
essential
feature
so
long
as
our
memory
remained
in
for
the
blind
they
teach
the
pupils
as
much
light
as
in
ordinary
schools
reflection
refraction
the
spectrum
the
are
all
studied
but
the
best
taught
pupil
of
such
an
establishment
yet
lacks
a
knowledge
which
the
least
instructed
seeing
baby
has
they
can
never
show
him
light
is
in
its
intention
and
the
loss
of
that
sensible
knowledge
no
can
replace
all
this
is
so
obvious
that
we
usually
find
sensation
as
an
element
of
experience
even
by
those
philosophers
who
are
least
inclined
to
make
much
of
its
importance
or
to
pay
respect
to
the
knowledge
which
it
brings
distinguished
from
both
sensation
and
perception
for
all
their
difference
are
yet
alike
in
that
their
objects
appear
and
objects
merely
or
on
the
contrary
are
relatively
faint
and
devoid
of
this
pungency
or
tang
this
quality
of
which
the
objects
of
sensation
possess
now
the
cortical
to
which
sensations
are
attached
are
due
to
incoming
currents
from
the
periphery
of
the
body
an
external
object
must
excite
the
eye
ear
before
the
sensation
comes
those
cortical
processes
on
the
other
hand
to
which
mere
ideas
or
images
are
attached
are
due
in
all
probability
to
currents
from
other
convolutions
it
would
seem
then
that
the
currents
from
the
periphery
normally
awaken
a
kind
of
which
the
currents
from
other
convolutions
are
inadequate
to
arouse
to
this
sort
of
activity
a
profounder
degree
of
disintegration
perhaps
the
quality
of
vividness
presence
or
reality
in
the
object
of
the
resultant
consciousness
seems
correlated
exteriority
of
objects
of
every
thing
or
quality
felt
is
felt
in
outer
space
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
a
brightness
or
a
color
otherwise
than
as
extended
and
outside
of
the
body
sounds
also
appear
in
space
contacts
are
against
the
body
surface
and
pains
always
occupy
some
organ
an
opinion
which
has
had
much
currency
in
psychology
is
that
sensible
qualities
are
first
apprehended
as
the
mind
and
then
from
it
or
by
a
secondary
intellectual
or
mental
act
there
is
no
ground
whatever
for
this
opinion
the
only
facts
which
even
seem
to
make
for
it
can
be
much
better
explained
in
another
way
as
we
shall
see
later
on
the
very
first
sensation
which
an
infant
gets
for
him
the
outer
universe
and
the
universe
which
he
comes
to
know
in
later
life
is
nothing
but
an
amplification
of
that
first
simple
germ
which
by
accretion
on
the
one
hand
and
intussusception
on
the
other
has
grown
so
big
and
complex
and
articulate
that
its
first
estate
is
unrememberable
in
his
dumb
awakening
to
the
consciousness
of
a
mere
as
yet
or
something
for
which
even
the
term
would
perhaps
be
too
discriminative
and
the
intellectual
acknowledgment
of
which
would
be
better
expressed
by
the
bare
interjection
the
infant
encounters
an
object
in
which
though
it
be
given
in
a
pure
sensation
all
the
of
the
understanding
are
contained
has
externality
objectivity
unity
substantiality
causality
in
the
full
sense
in
which
any
later
object
or
system
of
objects
has
these
here
the
young
knower
meets
and
greets
his
world
and
the
miracle
of
knowledge
bursts
forth
as
voltaire
says
as
much
in
the
infant
lowest
sensation
as
in
the
highest
achievement
of
a
newton
brain
the
physiological
condition
of
this
first
sensible
experience
is
probably
many
coming
in
from
various
peripheral
organs
at
once
but
this
multitude
of
organic
conditions
does
not
prevent
the
consciousness
from
being
one
consciousness
we
shall
see
as
we
go
on
that
it
can
be
one
consciousness
even
though
it
be
due
to
the
coÃ¶peration
of
numerous
organs
and
be
a
consciousness
of
many
things
together
the
object
which
the
numerous
inpouring
currents
of
the
baby
bring
to
his
consciousness
is
one
big
blooming
buzzing
confusion
that
confusion
is
the
baby
universe
and
the
universe
of
all
of
us
is
still
to
a
great
extent
such
a
confusion
potentially
resolvable
and
demanding
to
be
resolved
but
not
yet
actually
resolved
into
parts
it
appears
from
first
to
last
as
a
thing
so
far
as
it
is
unanalyzed
and
unresolved
we
may
be
said
to
know
it
sensationally
but
as
fast
as
parts
are
distinguished
in
it
and
we
become
aware
of
their
relations
our
knowledge
becomes
perceptual
or
even
conceptual
and
as
such
need
not
concern
us
in
the
present
chapter
intensity
of
a
light
may
be
so
weak
as
not
sensibly
to
dispel
the
darkness
a
sound
so
low
as
not
to
be
heard
a
contact
so
faint
that
we
fail
to
notice
it
in
other
words
a
certain
finite
amount
of
the
outward
stimulus
is
required
to
produce
any
sensation
of
its
presence
at
all
this
is
called
by
fechner
the
law
of
the
something
must
be
stepped
over
before
the
object
can
gain
entrance
to
the
mind
an
impression
just
above
the
threshold
is
called
the
etc
from
this
point
onwards
as
the
impressing
force
increases
the
sensation
increases
also
though
at
a
slower
rate
until
at
last
an
of
the
sensation
is
reached
which
no
increase
in
the
stimulus
can
make
sensibly
more
great
usually
before
the
acme
begins
to
mix
with
the
specific
character
of
the
sensation
this
is
definitely
observable
in
the
cases
of
great
pressure
intense
heat
cold
light
and
sound
and
in
those
of
smell
and
taste
less
definitely
so
only
from
the
fact
that
we
can
less
easily
increase
the
force
of
the
stimuli
here
on
the
other
hand
all
sensations
however
unpleasant
when
more
intense
are
rather
agreeable
than
otherwise
in
their
very
lowest
degrees
a
faintly
bitter
taste
or
putrid
smell
may
at
least
be

said
that
the
intensity
of
the
sensation
increases
by
slower
steps
than
those
by
which
its
exciting
cause
increases
if
there
were
no
threshold
and
if
every
equal
increment
in
the
outer
stimulus
produced
an
equal
increment
in
the
sensation

a
simple
straight
line
would
represent

the
of
the

between
the
two
things

case
of
weights
i
will
quote
wundt
account
of
the
law
and
of
the
facts
on
which
it
is
based
every
one
knows
that
in
the
stilly
night
we
hear
things
unnoticed
in
the
noise
of
day
the
gentle
ticking
of
the
clock
the
air
circulating
through
the
chimney
the
cracking
of
the
chairs
in
the
room
and
a
thousand
other
slight
noises
impress
themselves
upon
our
ear
it
is
equally
well
known
that
in
the
confused
hubbub
of
the
streets
or
the
clamor
of
a
railway
we
may
lose
not
only
what
our
neighbor
says
to
us
but
even
not
hear
the
sound
of
our
own
voice
the
stars
which
are
brightest
at
night
are
invisible
by
day
and
although
we
see
the
moon
then
she
is
far
paler
than
at
night
every
one
who
has
had
to
deal
with
weights
knows
that
if
to
a
pound
in
the
hand
a
second
pound
be
added
the
difference
is
immediately
felt
whilst
if
it
be
added
to
a
hundredweight
we
are
not
aware
of
the
difference
at
all
the
sound
of
the
clock
the
light
of
the
stars
the
pressure
of
the
pound
these
are
all
to
our
senses
and
stimuli
whose
outward
amount
remains
the
same
what
then
do
these
experiences
teach
evidently
nothing
but
this
that
one
and
the
same
stimulus
according
to
the
circumstances
under
which
it
operates
will
be
felt
either
more
or
less
intensely
or
not
felt
at
all
of
what
sort
now
is
the
alteration
in
the
circumstances
upon
which
this
alteration
in
the
feeling
may
depend
on
considering
the
matter
closely
we
see
that
it
is
everywhere
of
one
and
the
same
kind
the
tick
of
the
clock
is
a
feeble
stimulus
for
our
auditory
nerve
which
we
hear
plainly
when
it
is
alone
but
not
when
it
is
added
to
the
strong
stimulus
of
the
and
other
noises
of
the
day
the
light
of
the
stars
is
a
stimulus
to
the
eye
but
if
the
stimulation
which
this
light
exerts
be
added
to
the
strong
stimulus
of
daylight
we
feel
nothing
of
it
although
we
feel
it
distinctly
when
it
unites
itself
with
the
feebler
stimulation
of
the
twilight
the
poundweight
is
a
stimulus
to
our
skin
which
we
feel
when
it
joins
itself
to
a
preceding
stimulus
of
equal
strength
but
which
vanishes
when
it
is
combined
with
a
stimulus
a
thousand
times
greater
in
amount
we
may
therefore
lay
it
down
as
a
general
rule
that
a
stimulus
in
order
to
be
felt
may
be
so
much
the
smaller
if
the
already
preÃ«xisting
stimulation
of
the
organ
is
small
but
must
be
so
much
the
larger
the
greater
the
preÃ«xisting
stimulation
is
the
simplest
relation
would
obviously
be
that
the
sensation
should
increase
in
identically
the
same
ratio
as
the
stimulus
but
if
this
simplest
of
all
relations
prevailed
the
light
of
the
stars
ought
to
make
as
great
an
addition
to
the
daylight
as
it
does
to
the
darkness
of
the
nocturnal
sky
and
this
we
know
to
be
not
the
case
so
it
is
clear
that
the
strength
of
the
sensations
does
not
increase
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
the
stimuli
but
more
slowly
and
now
comes
the
question
in
what
proportion
does
the
increase
of
the
sensation
grow
less
as
the
increase
of
the
stimulus
grows
greater
to
answer
this
question
experiences
do
not
suffice
we
need
exact
measurements
both
of
the
amounts
of
the
various
stimuli
and
of
the
intensity
of
the
sensations
themselves
how
to
execute
these
measurements
however
is
something
which
daily
experience
suggests
to
measure
the
strength
of
sensations
is
as
we
saw
impossible
we
can
only
measure
the
difference
of
sensations
experience
showed
us
what
very
unequal
differences
of
sensation
might
come
from
equal
differences
of
outward
stimulus
but
all
these
experiences
expressed
themselves
in
one
kind
of
fact
that
the
same
difference
of
stimulus
could
in
one
case
be
felt
and
in
another
case
not
felt
at
all
a
pound
felt
if
added
to
another
pound
but
not
if
added
to
a
hundredweight
we
can
quickest
reach
a
result
with
our
observations
if
we
start
with
an
arbitrary
strength
of
stimulus
notice
what
sensation
it
gives
us
and
then
how
much
we
can
increase
the
stimulus
without
making
the
sensation
seem
to
if
we
carry
out
such
observations
with
stimuli
of
varying
absolute
amounts
we
shall
be
forced
to
choose
in
an
equally
varying
way
the
amounts
of
addition
to
the
stimulus
which
are
capable
of
giving
us
a
just
barely
perceptible
feeling
of
a
light
to
be
just
perceptible
in
the
twilight
need
not
be
near
as
bright
as
the
starlight
it
must
be
far
brighter
to
be
just
perceived
during
the
day
if
now
we
institute
such
observations
for
all
possible
strengths
of
the
various
stimuli
and
note
for
each
strength
the
amount
of
addition
of
the
latter
required
to
produce
a
barely
perceptible
alteration
of
sensation
we
shall
have
a
series
of
figures
in
which
is
immediately
expressed
the
law
according
to
which
the
sensation
alters
when
the
stimulation
is
increased
observations
according
to
this
method
are
particularly
easy
to
make
in
the
spheres
of
light
sound
and
pressure
beginning
with
the
latter
case
we
find
a
surprisingly
simple
result
barely
sensible
addition
to
the
original
weight
must
stand
exactly
in
the
same
proportion
to
be
the
of
it
no
matter
what
the
absolute
value
may
be
of
the
weights
on
which
the
experiment
is
made
as
the
average
of
a
number
of
experiments
this
fraction
is
found
to
be
about
that
is
no
matter
what
pressure
there
may
already
be
made
upon
the
skin
an
increase
or
a
diminution
of
the
pressure
will
be
as
soon
as
the
added
or
subtracted
weight
amounts
to
one
third
of
the
weight
originally
there
wundt
then
describes
how
differences
may
be
observed
in
the
muscular
feelings
in
the
feelings
of
heat
in
those
of
light
and
in
those
of
sound
and
he
concludes
thus
so
we
have
found
that
all
the
senses
whose
stimuli
we
are
enabled
to
measure
accurately
obey
a
uniform
law
however
various
may
be
their
several
delicacies
of
discrimination
holds
true
of
all
that
increase
of
the
stimulus
necessary
to
produce
an
increase
of
the
sensation
bears
a
constant
ratio
to
the
total
the
figures
which
express
this
ratio
in
the
several
senses
may
be
shown
thus
in
tabular
form
sensation
of
light
muscular
sensation
feeling
of
pressure
warmth
sound
these
figures
are
far
from
giving
as
accurate
a
measure
as
might
be
desired
but
at
least
they
are
fit
to
convey
a
general
notion
of
the
relative
discriminative
susceptibility
of
the
different
senses
the
important
law
which
gives
in
so
simple
a
form
the
relation
of
the
sensation
to
the
stimulus
that
calls
it
forth
was
first
discovered
by
the
physiologist
ernst
heinrich
weber
to
obtain
in
special
cases
another
way
of
expressing
weber
law
is
to
say
that
to
get
equal
positive
additions
to
the
sensation
one
must
make
equal
additions
to
the
stimulus
professor
fechner
of
leipzig
founded
upon
weber
law
a
theory
of
the
numerical
measurement
of
sensations
over
which
much
metaphysical
discussion
has
raged
each
just
perceptible
addition
to
the
sensation
as
we
gradually
let
the
stimulus
increase
was
supposed
by
him
to
be
a
of
sensation
and
all
these
units
were
treated
by
him
as
equal
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
increments
need
by
no
means
appear
when
they
once
are
perceived
the
many
pounds
which
form
the
just
perceptible
addition
to
a
hundredweight
feel
bigger
when
added
than
the
few
ounces
which
form
the
just
perceptible
addition
to
a
pound
fechner
ignored
this
fact
he
considered
that
if
distinct
perceptible
steps
of
increase
might
be
passed
through
in
gradually
increasing
a
stimulus
from
the
till
the
intensity
was
felt
then
the
sensation
of
was
composed
of
units
which
were
of
the
same
value
all
along
the
line
sensations
once
represented
by
numbers
psychology
may
become
according
to
fechner
an
science
susceptible
of
mathematical
treatment
his
general
formula
for
getting
at
the
number
of
units
in
any
sensation
is
log
where
stands
for
the
sensation
for
the
stimulus
numerically
estimated
and
for
a
constant
that
must
be
separately
determined
by
experiment
in
each
particular
order
of
sensibility
the
sensation
is
proportional
to
the
logarithm
of
the
stimulus
and
the
absolute
values
in
units
of
any
series
of
sensations
might
be
got
from
the
ordinates
of
the
curve
in
fig
if
it
were
a
correctly
drawn
logarithmic
curve
with
the
thresholds
rightly
plotted
out
from
experiments
fechner
formula
as
he
called
it
has
been
attacked
on
every
hand
and
as
absolutely
nothing
practical
has
come
of
it
it
need
receive
no
farther
notice
here
the
main
outcome
of
his
book
has
been
to
stir
up
experimental
investigation
into
the
validity
of
weber
law
which
concerns
itself
merely
with
the
just
perceptible
increase
and
says
nothing
about
the
measurement
of
the
sensation
as
a
whole
and
to
promote
discussion
of
statistical
methods
weber
law
as
will
appear
when
we
take
the
senses
is
only
approximately
verified
the
discussion
of
statistical
methods
is
necessitated
by
the
extraordinary
fluctuations
of
our
sensibility
from
one
moment
to
the
next
it
is
found
namely
when
the
difference
of
two
sensations
approaches
the
limit
of
discernibility
that
at
one
moment
we
discern
it
and
at
the
next
we
do
not
our
incessant
accidental
inner
alterations
make
it
impossible
to
tell
just
what
the
least
discernible
increment
of
the
sensation
is
without
taking
the
average
of
a
large
number
of
appreciations
these
are
as
likely
to
increase
as
to
diminish
our
sensibility
and
are
eliminated
in
such
an
average
for
those
above
and
those
below
the
line
then
neutralize
each
other
in
the
sum
and
the
normal
sensibility
if
there
be
one
that
is
the
sensibility
due
to
constant
causes
as
distinguished
from
these
accidental
ones
stands
revealed
the
methods
of
getting
the
average
all
have
their
difficulties
and
their
snares
and
controversy
over
them
has
become
very
subtle
indeed
as
an
instance
of
how
laborious
some
of
the
statistical
methods
are
and
how
patient
german
investigators
can
be
i
may
say
that
fechner
himself
in
testing
weber
law
for
weights
by
the
of
true
and
false
cases
tabulated
and
computed
no
less
than
separate
judgments
are
not
the
fundamental
objection
to
whole
attempt
seems
to
be
this
that
although
the
outer
of
our
sensations
may
have
many
parts
every
distinguishable
degree
as
well
as
every
distinguishable
quality
of
the
appears
to
be
a
unique
fact
of
consciousness
each
sensation
is
a
complete
integer
a
strong
one
as
mÃ¼nsterberg
says
is
not
the
multiple
of
a
weak
one
or
a
compound
of
many
weak
ones
but
rather
something
entirely
new
and
as
it
were
incomparable
so
that
to
seek
a
measurable
difference
between
strong
and
weak
sonorous
luminous
or
thermic
sensations
would
seem
at
first
sight
as
senseless
as
to
try
to
compute
mathematically
the
difference
between
salt
and
sour
or
between
headache
and
toothache
it
is
clear
that
if
in
the
stronger
sensation
of
light
the
weaker
sensation
is
not
it
is
unpsychological
to
say
that
the
former
differs
from
the
latter
by
a
certain
surely
our
feeling
of
scarlet
is
not
a
feeling
of
pink
with
a
lot
more
pink
added
it
is
something
quite
other
than
pink
similarly
with
our
sensation
of
an
electric
it
does
not
contain
that
of
many
smoky
tallow
candles
in
itself
every
sensation
presents
itself
as
an
indivisible
unit
and
it
is
quite
impossible
to
read
any
clear
meaning
into
the
notion
that
they
are
masses
of
units
combined
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
this
statement
and
the
fact
that
starting
with
a
weak
sensation
and
increasing
it
we
feel
as
the
increase
goes
on
it
is
not
more
of
the
same
added
so
to
speak
but
it
is
more
and
more
more
and
more
from
the
which
we
feel
in
the
chapter
on
discrimination
we
shall
see
that
difference
can
be
perceived
between
simple
things
we
shall
see
too
that
themselves
there
are
directions
of
and
along
any
one
of
them
a
series
of
things
may
be
arranged
so
as
to
increase
steadily
in
that
direction
in
any
such
series
the
end
differs
more
from
the
beginning
than
the
middle
does
differences
of
form
one
such
direction
of
possible
increase
so
our
judgments
of
more
intensity
can
be
expressed
without
the
hypothesis
that
more
units
have
been
added
to
a
growing
sum
of
relativity
weber
law
seems
only
one
case
of
the
still
wider
law
that
the
more
we
have
to
attend
to
the
less
capable
we
are
of
noticing
any
one
detail
the
law
is
obvious
where
the
things
differ
in
kind
how
easily
do
we
forget
a
bodily
discomfort
when
conversation
waxes
hot
how
little
do
we
notice
the
noises
in
the
room
so
long
as
our
work
absorbs
us
plura
intentus
minus
est
ad
singula
as
the
old
proverb
says
one
might
now
add
that
the
homogeneity
of
what
we
have
to
attend
to
does
not
alter
the
result
but
that
a
mind
with
two
strong
sensations
of
the
same
sort
already
before
it
is
incapacitated
by
their
amount
from
noticing
the
detail
of
a
difference
between
them
which
it
would
immediately
be
struck
by
were
the
sensations
themselves
weaker
and
consequently
endowed
with
less
distracting
power
this
particular
idea
may
be
taken
for
what
it
is
worth
meanwhile
it
is
an
undoubted
general
fact
that
the
psychical
effect
of
incoming
currents
does
depend
on
what
other
currents
may
be
simultaneously
pouring
in
not
only
the
of
the
object
which
the
current
brings
before
the
mind
but
the
of
it
is
changed
by
the
other
currents
simultaneous
sensations
modify
each
other
is
a
brief
expression
for
this
law
we
feel
all
things
in
relation
to
each
other
is
wundt
vaguer
formula
for
this
general
of
relativity
which
in
one
shape
or
other
has
had
vogue
since
hobbes
time
in
psychology
much
mystery
has
been
made
of
it
but
although
we
are
of
course
ignorant
of
the
more
intimate
processes
involved
there
seems
no
ground
to
doubt
that
they
are
physiological
and
come
from
the
interference
of
one
current
with
another
a
current
interfered
with
might
naturally
give
rise
to
a
modified
sensation
examples
of
the
modification
in
question
are
easy
to
find
notes
make
each
other
sweeter
in
a
chord
and
so
do
colors
when
harmoniously
combined
a
certain
amount
of
skin
dipped
in
hot
water
gives
the
perception
of
a
certain
heat
more
skin
immersed
makes
the
heat
much
more
intense
although
of
course
the
water
heat
is
the
same
similarly
there
is
a
of
size
in
objects
the
image
they
cast
on
the
retina
must
needs
excite
a
sufficient
number
of
fibres
or
it
will
give
no
sensation
of
color
at
all
weber
observed
that
a
thaler
laid
on
the
skin
of
the
forehead
feels
heavier
when
cold
than
when
warm
urbantschitsch
has
found
that
all
our
influence
each
other
sensations
the
hue
of
patches
of
color
so
distant
as
not
to
be
recognized
was
immediately
in
his
patients
perceived
when
a
was
sounded
close
to
the
ear
letters
too
far
off
to
be
read
could
be
read
when
the
was
heard
etc
the
most
familiar
examples
of
this
sort
of
thing
seem
to
be
the
increase
of
by
noise
or
light
and
the
increase
of
by
all
concomitant
sensations
of
the
examples
of
the
way
in
which
one
modifies
another
are
the
phenomena
of
what
is
known
as
take
a
number
of
sheets
of
brightly
and
differently
colored
papers
lay
on
each
of
them
a
bit
of
one
and
the
same
kind
of
gray
paper
then
cover
each
sheet
with
some
transparent
white
paper
which
softens
the
look
of
both
the
gray
paper
and
the
colored
ground
the
gray
patch
will
appear
in
each
case
tinged
by
the
color
to
the
ground
and
so
different
will
the
several
pieces
appear
that
no
observer
before
raising
the
transparent
paper
will
believe
them
all
cut
out
of
the
same
gray
helmholtz
has
interpreted
these
results
as
being
due
to
a
false
application
of
an
inveterate
habit
that
namely
of
making
allowance
for
the
color
of
the
medium
through
which
things
are
seen
the
same
in
the
blue
light
of
a
clear
sky
in
the
light
of
a
candle
in
the
dark
brown
light
of
a
polished
mahogany
table
which
may
reflect
its
image
is
always
judged
of
its
own
proper
color
which
the
mind
out
of
its
own
knowledge
to
the
appearance
thereby
correcting
the
falsifying
medium
in
the
cases
of
the
papers
according
to
helmholtz
the
mind
believes
the
color
of
the
ground
subdued
by
the
transparent
paper
to
be
faintly
spread
the
gray
patch
but
a
patch
to
gray
through
such
a
colored
film
would
have
really
to
of
the
complementary
color
to
the
film
therefore
it
of
the
complementary
color
we
think
and
proceed
to
it
of
that
color
this
theory
has
been
shown
to
be
untenable
by
hering
the
discussion
of
the
facts
is
too
minute
for
recapitulation
here
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
it
proves
the
phenomenon
to
be
physiological
a
case
of
the
way
in
which
when
sensory
run
in
together
the
effect
of
each
on
consciousness
is
different
from
that
which
it
would
be
if
they
ran
in
separately
differs
from
the
simultaneous
variety
and
is
supposed
to
be
due
to
fatigue
the
facts
will
be
noticed
under
the
head
of
in
the
section
on
vision
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
however
that
from
previous
sensations
may
coexist
with
present
sensations
and
the
two
may
modify
each
other
just
as
coexisting
sensational
processes
do
other
senses
than
sight
show
phenomena
of
contrast
but
they
are
much
less
obvious
so
i
will
not
notice
them

can
now

the
specific

be
kept
fixed

passing

the

also
disappear
at
the
fovea
leaving
the
cones
alone
to
represent
the
retina
there
the
sensibility
of
the
retina
grows
progressively
less
towards
its
periphery
by
means
of
which
neither
colors
shapes
nor
number
of
impressions
can
be
well
discriminated
in
the
normal
use
of
our
two
eyes
the
eyeballs
are
rotated
so
as
to
cause
the
two
images
of
any
object
which
catches
the
attention
to
fall
on
the
two
foveÃ¦
as
the
spots
of
acutest
vision
this
happens
involuntarily
as
any
one
may
observe
in
fact
it
is
almost
impossible
to
the
eyes
the
moment
any
peripherally
lying
object
does
catch
our
attention

turning
of

eyes

only
another
name
for
such
rotation
of
the
eyeballs
as
will
bring
the

of

from
the
eye
the
farther
forward

the
nearer
the
object

farther
backward

drawn
away
from
the
lens
when
the
object
that
casts
the
picture
is
near
and
pushed
forward
when
it
is
far
the
picture
is
thus
kept
always
sharp
but
no
such
change
of
length
is
possible
in
the
eyeball
and
the
same
result
is
reached
in
another
way
the
lens
namely
grows
more
convex
when
a
near
object
is
looked
at
and
flatter
when
the
object
recedes
this
change
is
due
to
the
antagonism
of
the
circular
in
which
the
lens
is
suspended
and
the
muscle
the
ligament
when
the
ciliary
muscle
is
at
rest
assumes
such
a
shape
as
to
keep
the
lens
rather
flat
but
the
lens
is
highly
elastic
and
it
springs
into
the
more
convex
form
which
is
natural
to
it
whenever
the
ciliary
muscle
by
contracting
causes
the
ligament
to
relax
its
pressure
the
contraction
of
the
muscle
by
thus
rendering
the
lens
more
refractive
adapts
the
eye
for
near
objects
it
for
them
as
we
say
and
its
relaxation
by
rendering
the
lens
less
refractive
adapts
the
eye
for
distant
vision
accommodation
for
the
near
is
thus
the
more
change
since
it
involves
contraction
of
the
ciliary
muscle
when
we
look
far
off
we
simply
let
our
eyes
go
passive
we
feel
this
difference
in
the
effort
when
we
compare
the
two
sensations
of
change
accompanies
the
two
eyes
act
as
one
organ
that
is
when
an
object
catches
the
attention
both
eyeballs
turn
so
that
its
images
may
fall
on
the
foveÃ¦
when
the
object
is
near
this
naturally
requires
them
to
turn
inwards
or
converge
and
as
accommodation
then
also
occurs
the
two
movements
of
convergence
and
accommodation
form
a
naturally
associated
couple
of
which
it
is
difficult
to
execute
either
singly
contraction
of
the
pupil
also
accompanies
the
accommodative
act
when
we
come
to
stereoscopic
vision
it
will
appear
that
by
much
practice
one
can
learn
to
converge
with
relaxed
accommodation
and
to
accommodate
with
parallel
axes
of
vision
these
are
accomplishments
which
the
student
of
psychological
optics
will
find
most
useful

the
two

hear
single
with
two

and
we
also
see
single
with
two
eyes
the
difference
is
that
we
also
see
double
under
certain
conditions
whereas
under
no
conditions
can
we
hear
or
smell
double
the
main
conditions
of
single
vision
can
be
simply
expressed
in
the
first
place
impressions
on
the
two
foveÃ¦
always
appear
in
the
same
place
by
no
artifice
can
they
be
made
to
appear
alongside
of
each
other
the
result
is
that
one
object
casting
its
images
on
the
foveÃ¦
of
the
two
converging
eyeballs
will
necessarily
always
appear
as
what
it
is
namely
one
object
furthermore
if
the
eyeballs
instead
of
converging
are
kept
parallel
and
two
similar
objects
one
in
front
of
each
cast
their
respective
images
on
the
foveÃ¦
the
two
will
also
appear
as
one
or
in
common
parlance
images
will
fuse
to
verify
this
let
the
reader
stare
fixedly
before
him
as
if
through
the
paper
at
infinite
distance
with
the
black
spots
in
fig
in
front
of
his
respective
eyes
he
will
then
see
the
two
black
spots
swim
together
as
it
were
and
combine
into
one
which
appears
situated
between
their
original
two
positions
and
as
if
opposite
the
root
of
his
nose
this
combined
spot
is
the
result
of
the
spots
opposite
both
eyes
being
seen
in
the
same
place
but
in
addition
to
the
combined
spot
each
eye
sees
also
the
spot
opposite
the
eye
to
the
right
eye
this
appears
to
the
left
of
the
combined
spot
to
the
left
eye
it
appears
to
the
right
of
it
so
that
what
is
seen
is
spots
of
which
the
middle
one
is
seen
by
both
eyes
and
is
flanked
by
two
others
each
seen
by
one
that
such
are
the
facts
can
be
tested
by
interposing
some
small
opaque
object
so
as
to
cut
off
the
vision
of
either
of
the
spots
in
the
figure
from
the
eye
a
vertical
partition
in
the
median
plane
going
from
the
paper
to
the
nose
will
effectually
confine
each
vision
to
the
spot
in
front
of
it
and
then
the
single
combined
spot
will
be
all
that
appears
illustration
fig
if
instead
of
two
identical
spots
we
use
two
different
figures
or
two
differently
colored
spots
as
objects
for
the
two
foveÃ¦
to
look
at
they
still
are
seen
in
the
but
since
they
can
not
appear
as
a
single
object
they
appear
there
displacing
each
other
from
the
view
this
is
the
phenomenon
called
as
regards
the
parts
of
the
retinÃ¦
round
about
the
foveÃ¦
a
similar
correspondence
obtains
any
impression
on
the
upper
half
of
either
retina
makes
us
see
an
object
as
below
on
the
lower
half
as
above
the
horizon
and
on
the
right
half
of
either
retina
an
impression
makes
us
see
an
object
to
the
left
on
the
left
half
one
to
the
right
of
the
median
line
thus
each
quadrant
of
one
retina
corresponds
as
a
whole
to
the
geometrically
quadrant
of
the
other
and
within
two
similar
quadrants
and
for
example
there
should
if
the
correspondence
were
carried
out
in
detail
be
geometrically
similar
points
which
if
impressed
at
the
same
time
by
light
emitted
from
the
same
object
should
cause
that
object
to
appear
in
the
same
direction
to
either
eye
experiment
verifies
this
surmise
if
we
look
at
the
starry
vault
with
parallel
eyes
the
stars
all
seem
single
and
the
laws
of
perspective
show
that
under
the
circumstances
the
parallel
coming
from
each
star
must
impinge
on
points
within
either
retina
which
geometrically
similar
to
each
other
similarly
a
pair
of
spectacles
held
an
inch
or
so
from
the
eyes
seem
like
one
large
median
glass
or
we
may
make
an
experiment
like
that
with
the
spots
if
we
take
two
exactly
similar
pictures
no
larger
than
those
on
an
ordinary
stereoscopic
slide
and
if
we
look
at
one
with
each
eye
a
median
partition
confining
the
view
we
shall
see
but
one
flat
picture
all
of
whose
parts
appear
single
retinal
points
being
impressed
both
eyes
see
their
object
in
the
same
direction
and
the
two
objects
consequently
coalesce
into
one
illustration

here
again
retinal
rivalry
occurs
if
the
pictures
differ
and
it
must
be
noted
that
when
the
experiment
is
performed
for
the
first
time
the
combined
picture
is
always
far
from
sharp
this
is
due
to
the
difficulty
mentioned
on
of
accommodating
for
anything
as
near
as
the
surface
of
the
paper
whilst
at
the
same
time
the
convergence
is
relaxed
so
that
each
eye
sees
the
picture
in
front
of
itself
illustration
fig
now
it
is
an
immediate
consequence
of
the
law
of
identical
location
of
images
falling
on
geometrically
similar
points
that
which
fall
upon
disparate
of
the
two
retinÃ¦
should
be
seen
disparate
and
that
their
objects
should
consequently
appear
two

double
take
the
parallel
rays
from
a
star
falling
upon
two
eyes
which
converge
upon
a
near
object
instead
of
being
parallel
as
in
the
previously
instanced
case
the
two
foveÃ¦
will
receive
the
images
of
which
therefore
will
look
single
if
then
and
in
fig
be
the
parallel
rays
each
of
them
will
fall
upon
the
nasal
half
of
the
retina
which
it
strikes
but
the
two
nasal
halves
are
disparate
geometrically
not
geometrically
the
star
image
on
the
left
eye
will
therefore
appear
as
if
lying
to
the
left
of
its
image
on
the
right
eye
will
appear
to
the
right
of
this
point
the
star
will
in
short
be
seen
double
double
conversely
if
the
star
be
looked
at
directly
with
parallel
axes
any
near
object
like
will
be
seen
double
because
its
images
will
affect
the
outer
or
cheek
halves
of
the
two
retinÃ¦
instead
of
one
outer
and
one
nasal
half
the
position
of
the
images
will
here
be
reversed
from
that
of
the
previous
case
the
right
eye
image
will
now
appear
to
the
left
the
left
eye
to
the
right
the
double
images
will
be
the
same
reasoning
and
the
same
result
ought
to
apply
where
the
place
with
respect
to
the
direction
of
the
two
optic
axes
is
such
as
to
make
its
images
fall
not
on
retinal
halves
but
on
parts
of
similar
halves
here
of
course
the
positions
seen
will
be
less
widely
disparate
than
in
the
other
case
and
the
double
images
will
appear
to
lie
less
widely
apart
careful
experiments
made
by
many
observers
according
to
the
haploscopic
method
confirm
this
law
and
show
that
points
of
single
visual
exist
upon
the
two
retinÃ¦
for
the
detail
of
these
one
must
consult
the
special
treatises
of
this
description
of
binocular
vision
follows
what
is
called
the
theory
of
identical
points
on
the
whole
it
formulates
the
facts
correctly
the
only
odd
thing
is
that
we
should
be
so
little
troubled
by
the
innumerable
double
images
which
objects
nearer
and
farther
than
the
point
looked
at
must
be
constantly
producing
the
answer
to
this
is
that
have
trained
ourselves
to
habits
of
in
regard
to
double
images
so
far
as
things
interest
us
we
turn
our
foveÃ¦
upon
them
and
they
are
necessarily
seen
single
so
that
if
an
object
impresses
disparate
points
that
may
be
taken
as
proof
that
it
is
so
unimportant
for
us
that
we
need
notice
whether
it
appears
in
one
place
or
in
two
by
long
practice
one
may
acquire
great
expertness
in
detecting
double
images
though
as
some
one
says
it
is
an
art
which
is
not
to
be
learned
completely
either
in
one
year
or
in
two
illustration
fig
where
the
disparity
of
the
images
is
but
slight
it
is
almost
impossible
to
see
them
as
if
double
they
give
rather
the
perception
of
a
solid
object
being
there
to
fix
our
ideas
take
fig
suppose
we
look
at
the
dots
in
the
middle
of
the
lines
and
just
as
we
looked
at
the
spots
in
fig
we
shall
get
the
same
result
they
will
coalesce
in
the
median
line
but
the
entire
lines
will
not
coalesce
for
owing
to
their
inclination
their
tops
fall
on
the
temporal
and
their
bottoms
on
the
nasal
retinal
halves
what
we
see
will
be
two
lines
crossed
in
the
middle
thus
fig
illustration
fig
the
moment
we
attend
to
the
tops
of
these
lines
however
our
foveÃ¦
tend
to
abandon
the
dots
and
to
move
upwards
and
in
doing
so
to
converge
somewhat
following
the
lines
which
then
appear
coalescing
at
the
top
as
in
fig
illustration
fig

fig
if
we
think
of
the
bottom
the
eyes
descend
and
diverge
and
what
we
see
is
fig
running
our
eyes
up
and
down
the
lines
makes
them
converge
and
diverge
just
as
they
would
were
they
running
up
and
down
some
single
line
whose
top
was
nearer
to
us
than
its
bottom
now
if
the
inclination
of
the
lines
be
moderate
we
may
not
see
them
double
at
all
but
single
throughout
their
length
when
we
look
at
the
dots
under
these
conditions
their
top
does
look
nearer
than
their
bottom
in
other
words
we
see
them
stereoscopically
and
we
see
them
so
even
when
our
eyes
are
rigorously
motionless
in
other
words
the
slight
disparity
in
the
which
draw
the
foveÃ¦
divergently
apart
makes
us
see
those
ends
farther
the
slight
disparity
in
the
top
ends
which
draw
them
convergently
together
makes
us
see
these
ends
nearer
than
the
point
at
which
we
look
the

the
field
appears
extended
in
three
dimensions
with
some
of
its
parts
more
distant
and
some
more
near
with
one
eye
our
perception
of
distance
is
very
imperfect
as
illustrated
by
the
common
trick
of
holding
a
ring
suspended
by
a
string
in
front
of
a
person
face
and
telling
him
to
shut
one
eye
and
pass
a
rod
from
one
side
through
the
ring
if
a
penholder
be
held
erect
before
one
eye
while
the
other
is
closed
and
an
attempt
be
made
to
touch
it
with
a
finger
moved
across
towards
it
an
error
will
nearly
always
be
made
in
such
cases
we
get
the
only
clue
from
the
amount
of
effort
needed
to
the
eye
to
see
the
object
distinctly
when
we
use
both
eyes
our
perception
of
distance
is
much
better
when
we
look
at
an
object
with
two
eyes
the
visual
axes
are
converged
on
it
and
the
nearer
the
object
the
greater
the
convergence
we
have
a
pretty
accurate
knowledge
of
the
degree
of
muscular
effort
required
to
converge
the
eyes
on
all
tolerably
near
points
when
objects
are
farther
off
their
apparent
size
and
the
modifications
their
retinal
images
experience
by
aÃ«rial
perspective
come
in
to
help
the
relative
distance
of
objects
is
easiest
determined
by
moving
the
eyes
all
stationary
objects
then
appear
displaced
in
the
opposite
direction
as
for
example
when
we
look
out
of
the
window
of
a
railway
car
and
those
nearest
most
rapidly
from
the
different
apparent
rates
of
movement
we
can
tell
which
are
farther
and
which
nearer
subjectively
considered
distance
is
an
altogether
peculiar
content
of
consciousness
convergence
accommodation
binocular
disparity
size
degree
of
brightness
parallax
all
give
us
special
feelings
which
are
of
the
distance
feeling
but
not
it
they
simply
suggest
it
to
us
the
best
way
to
get
it
strongly
is
to
go
upon
some
and
invert
one
head
the
horizon
then
looks
very
distant
and
draws
near
as
the
head
erects
itself
again
perception
of
the
dimensions
of
the
retinal
image
determine
primarily
the
sensations
on
which
conclusions
as
to
size
are
based
and
the
larger
the
visual
angle
the
larger
the
retinal
image
since
the
visual
angle
depends
on
the
distance
of
an
object
the
correct
perception
of
size
depends
largely
upon
a
correct
perception
of
distance
having
formed
a
judgment
conscious
or
unconscious
as
to
that
we
conclude
as
to
size
from
the
extent
of
the
retinal
region
affected
most
people
have
been
surprised
now
and
then
to
find
that
what
appeared
a
large
bird
in
the
clouds
was
only
a
small
insect
close
to
the
eye
the
large
apparent
size
being
due
to
the
previous
incorrect
judgment
as
to
the
distance
of
the
object
the
presence
of
an
object
of
tolerably
height
as
a
man
also
assists
in
forming
conceptions
by
comparison
as
to
size
artists
for
this
purpose
frequently
introduce
human
figures
to
assist
in
giving
an
idea
of
the
size
of
other
objects
represented
of
the
system
of
colors
is
a
very
complex
thing
if
one
take
any
color
say
green
one
can
pass
away
from
it
in
more
than
one
direction
through
a
series
of
greens
more
and
more
yellowish
let
us
say
towards
yellow
or
through
another
series
more
and
more
bluish
towards
blue
the
result
would
be
that
if
we
seek
to
plot
out
on
paper
the
various
distinguishable
tints
the
arrangement
can
not
be
that
of
a
line
but
has
to
cover
a
surface
with
the
tints
arranged
on
a
surface
we
can
pass
from
any
one
of
them
to
any
other
by
various
lines
of
gradually
changing
intermediaries
such
an
arrangement
is
represented
in
fig
it
is
a
merely
classificatory
diagram
based
on
degrees
of
difference
simply
felt
and
has
no
physical
significance
black
is
a
color
but
does
not
figure
on
the
plane
of
the
diagram
we
can
not
place
it
anywhere
alongside
of
the
other
colors
because
we
need
both
to
represent
the
straight
gradation
from
untinted
white
to
black
and
that
from
each
pure
color
towards
black
as
well
as
towards
white
the
best
way
is
to
put
black
into
the
third
dimension
beneath
the
paper
as
is
shown
perspectively
in
fig
then
all
the
transitions
can
be
schematically
shown
one
can
pass
straight
from
black
to
white
or
one
can
pass
round
by
way
of
olive
green
and
pale
green
or
one
can
change
from
dark
blue
to
yellow
through
green
or
by
way
of
white
and
straw
color
etc
in
any
case
the
changes
are
continuous
and
the
color
system
thus
forms
what
wundt
calls
a
continuum
illustration
fig
physiologically
considered
the
colors
have
this
peculiarity
that
many
pairs
of
them
when
they
impress
the
retina
together
produce
the
sensation
of
white
the
colors
which
do
this
are
called
such
are
spectral
red
and
spectral
yellow
and
green
and
purple
again
are
complementaries
all
the
spectral
colors
added
together
also
make
white
light
such
as
we
daily
experience
in
the
sunshine
furthermore
both
homogeneous
and
heterogeneous
ones
may
make
us
feel
the
same
color
when
they
fall
on
our
retina
thus
yellow
which
is
a
simple
spectral
color
is
also
felt
when
green
light
is
added
to
red
blue
is
felt
when
violet
and
green
lights
are
mixed
purple
which
is
not
a
spectral
color
at
all
results
when
the
waves
either
of
red
and
of
violet
or
those
of
blue
and
of
orange
are
superposed
illustration
fig
after
ziehen
from
all
this
it
follows
that
there
is
no
particular
congruence
between
our
system
of
and
the
physical
stimuli
which
excite
them
each
is
a
energy
which
many
different
physical
causes
may
arouse
helmholtz
hering
and
others
have
sought
to
simplify
the
tangle
of
the
facts
by
physiological
hypotheses
which
differing
much
in
detail
agree
in
principle
since
they
all
postulate
a
limited
number
of
elementary
retinal
processes
to
which
when
excited
singly
certain
colors
severally
correspond

excited

most
various
physical
stimuli
other

called

the
secondary

often
spoken
of

if
they
were
compounded
of
the
primary
sensations
this
is
a
great
mistake
the

not
compounded

for
example
a
secondary
on
theory
is
as
unique
a
quality
of
feeling
as
the
primaries
red
and
green
which
are
said
to
it
what
are
compounded
are
merely
the
elementary
retinal
processes
these
according
to
their
combination
produce
diverse
results
on
the
brain
and
thence
the
secondary
colors
result
immediately
in

duration
of
luminous
this
is
greater
than
that
of
the
stimulus
a
fact
taken
advantage
of
in
making
fireworks
an
ascending
rocket
produces
the
sensation
of
a
trail
of
light
extending
far
behind
the
position
of
the
bright
part
of
the
rocket
itself
at
the
moment
because
the
sensation
aroused
by
it
in
a
lower
part
of
its
course
still
persists
so
shooting
stars
appear
to
have
luminous
tails
behind
them
by
rotating
rapidly
before
the
eye
a
disk
with
alternate
white
and
black
sectors
we
get
for
each
point
of
the
retina
alternate
stimulation
due
to
the
passage
of
white
sector
and
rest
when
a
black
sector
is
passing
if
the
rotation
be
rapid
enough
the
sensation
aroused
is
that
of
a
uniform
gray
such
as
would
be
produced
if
the
white
and
black
were
mixed
and
spread
evenly
over
the
disk
in
each
revolution
the
eye
gets
as
much
light
as
if
that
were
the
case
and
is
unable
to
distinguish
that
this
light
is
made
up
of
separate
portions
reaching
it
at
intervals
the
stimulation
due
to
each
lasts
until
the
next
begins
and
so
all
are
fused
together
if
one
turns
out
suddenly
the
gas
in
a
room
containing
no
other
light
the
image
of
the
flame
persists
a
short
time
after
the
flame
itself
is
extinguished
if
we
open
our
eyes
instantaneously
upon
a
scene
and
then
shroud
them
in
complete
darkness
it
will
be
as
if
we
saw
the
scene
in
ghostly
light
through
the
dark
screen
we
can
read
off
details
in
it
which
were
unnoticed
whilst
the
eyes
were
open
this
is
the
primary
positive
according
to
helmholtz
one
third
of
a
second
is
the
most
favorable
length
of
exposure
to
the
light
for
producing
it
are
due
to
more
complex
conditions
in
which
fatigue
of
the
retina
is
usually
supposed
to
play
the
chief
part
the
nervous
visual
apparatus
is
easily
fatigued
usually
we
do
not
observe
this
because
its
restoration
is
also
rapid
and
in
ordinary
life
our
eyes
when
open
are
never
at
rest
we
move
them
to
and
fro
so
that
parts
of
the
retina
receive
light
alternately
from
brighter
and
darker
objects
and
are
alternately
excited
and
rested
how
constant
and
habitual
the
movement
of
the
eyes
is
can
be
readily
observed
by
trying
to
for
a
short
time
a
small
spot
without
deviating
the
glance
to
do
so
for
even
a
few
seconds
is
impossible
without
practice
if
any
small
object
is
steadily
for
twenty
or
thirty
seconds
it
will
be
found
that
the
whole
field
of
vision
becomes
grayish
and
obscure
because
the
parts
of
the
retina
receiving
most
light
get
fatigued
and
arouse
no
more
sensation
than
those
less
fatigued
and
stimulated
by
light
from
less
illuminated
objects
or
look
steadily
at
a
black
object
say
a
blot
on
a
white
page
for
twenty
seconds
and
then
turn
the
eye
on
a
white
wall
the
latter
will
seem
dark
gray
with
a
white
patch
on
it
an
effect
due
to
the
greater
excitability
of
the
retinal
parts
previously
rested
by
the
black
when
compared
with
the
sensation
aroused
elsewhere
by
light
from
the
white
wall
acting
on
the
previously
stimulated
parts
of
the
visual
surface
all
persons
will
recall
many
instances
of
such
phenomena
which
are
especially
noticeable
soon
after
rising
in
the
morning
similar
things
may
be
noticed
with
colors
after
looking
at
a
red
patch
the
eye
turned
on
a
white
wall
sees
a
patch
the
elements
causing
red
sensations
having
been
fatigued
the
white
mixed
light
from
the
wall
now
excites
on
that
region
of
the
retina
only
the
other
primary
color
sensations
the
blending
of
colors
so
as
to
secure
their
greatest
effect
depends
on
this
fact
red
and
green
go
well
together
because
each
rests
the
parts
of
the
visual
apparatus
most
excited
by
the
other
and
so
each
appears
bright
and
vivid
as
the
eye
wanders
to
and
fro
while
red
and
orange
together
each
exciting
and
exhausting
mainly
the
same
visual
elements
render
dull
or
in
popular
phrase
one
another
if
we
fix
steadily
for
thirty
seconds
a
point
between
two
white
squares
about
mm
inch
apart
on
a
large
black
sheet
and
then
close
and
cover
our
eyes
we
get
a
negative
in
which
are
seen
two
dark
squares
on
a
brighter
surface
this
surface
is
brighter
close
around
the
negative
of
each
square
and
brightest
of
all
between
them
this
luminous
boundary
is
called
the
and
is
explained
usually
as
an
effect
of
simultaneous
contrast
the
dark
of
the
square
it
is
said
makes
us
mentally
err
in
judgment
and
think
the
clear
surface
close
to
it
brighter
than
elsewhere
and
it
is
brightest
between
the
two
dark
squares
just
as
a
man
between
two
tall
ones
looks
shorter
than
if
alongside
one
only
if
however
the
be
watched
it
will
often
be
noticed
not
only
that
the
light
band
between
the
squares
is
intensely
white
much
more
so
than
the
normal
light
see
below
but
as
the
image
fades
away
often
the
two
dark
of
the
squares
disappear
entirely
with
all
of
the
corona
except
that
part
between
them
which
is
still
seen
as
a
bright
band
on
a
uniform
grayish
field
here
there
is
no
to
produce
the
error
of
judgment
and
from
this
and
other
experiments
hering
concludes
that
light
acting
on
one
part
of
the
retina
produces
inverse
changes
in
all
the
rest
and
that
this
plays
an
important
part
in
producing
the
phenomena
of
contrasts
similar
phenomena
may
be
observed
with
colored
objects
in
their
negative
each
tint
is
represented
by
its
complementary
as
black
is
by
white
in
colorless
vision
this
is
one
of
the
facts
referred
to
on
which
have
made
hering
reject
the
psychological
explanation
of
simultaneous
contrast
intensity
of
luminous
black
is
an
optical
sensation
we
have
no
black
except
in
the
field
of
view
we
do
not
for
instance
see
black
out
of
our
stomach
or
out
of
the
palm
of
our
hand
black
is
however
only
an
idea
for
the
retina
itself
even
in
complete
objective
darkness
seems
to
be
always
the
seat
of
internal
changes
which
give
some
luminous
sensation
this
is
what
is
meant
by
the
light
spoken
of
a
few
lines
back
it
plays
its
part
in
the
determination
of
all
with
closed
eyes
any
objective
luminous
stimulus
to
be
perceived
must
be
strong
enough
to
give
a
sensible
increment
of
sensation
over
and
above
the
light
as
the
objective
stimulus
increases
the
perception
is
of
an
intenser
luminosity
but
the
perception
changes
as
we
saw
on
more
slowly
than
the
stimulus
the
latest
numerical
determinations
by
kÃ¶nig
and
brodhun
were
applied
to
six
different
colors
and
ran
from
an
intensity
arbitrarily
called
to
one
which
was
times
as
great
from
intensity
to
weber
law
held
good
below
and
above
this
range
discriminative
sensibility
declined
the
relative
increment
discriminated
here
was
the
same
for
all
colors
of
light
and
lay
according
to
the
tables
between
and
per
cent
of
the
stimulus
previous
observers
have
got
different
results
a
certain
amount
of
luminous
intensity
must
exist
in
an
object
for
its
color
to
be
discriminated
at
all
in
the
dark
all
cats
are
gray
but
the
colors
rapidly
become
distincter
as
the
light
increases
first
the
blues
and
last
the
reds
and
yellows
up
to
a
certain
point
of
intensity
when
they
grow
indistinct
again
through
the
fact
that
each
takes
a
turn
towards
white
at
the
highest
bearable
intensity
of
the
light
all
colors
are
lost
in
the
blinding
white
dazzle
this
again
is
usually
spoken
of
as
a
of
the
sensation
white
with
the
original
it
is
no
mixing
of
two
sensations
but
the
replacement
of
one
sensation
by
another
in
consequence
of
a
changed
neural
process

which
may

loud

this

depends
on
the
of
the
aÃ«rial
wave
a
single
puff
of
air
set
in
motion
by
no

what
cause
will
give
a
sensation
of
sound
but
it
takes
at
least
four
or
five
puffs
or
more
to
convey
a
sensation
of
pitch
the

a

of
its

is
produced
by
twice
as

vibrations

in
neither
case
is
it
necessary
for
the
vibrations
to
go
on
during
a
full
second
for
the
pitch
to
be
discerned
sound
vibrations
may
be
too
rapid
or
too
slow
in
succession
to
produce
sonorous
sensations
just
as
the

rays
of
the
solar
spectrum
fail
to
excite

the

answers
to

it
differs
in

many
persons
can
not
hear
the
cry
of
a
bat
nor
the
chirp
of
a
cricket
which
lie
near
this
upper
audible
limit
on
the
other
hand
sounds
of
vibrational
rate
about
per
second
are
not
well
heard
and
a
little
below
this
they
produce
rather
a
than
a
true
and
are
only
used
along
with
notes
of
higher
octaves
to
which
they
give
a
character
of
greater
depth
the
entire
system
of
pitches
forms
continuum
of
one
that
is
to
say
you
can
pass
from
one
pitch
to
another
only
by
one
set
of
intermediaries
instead
of
by
more
than
one
as
in
the
case
of

see
p
the
whole
series
of
pitches
is
embraced
in
and
between
the
terms
of
what
is
called
the
musical
scale
the
adoption
of
certain
arbitrary
points
in
this
scale
as
has
an
explanation
partly
historic
and
partly
Ã¦sthetic
but
too
complex
for
exposition
here
of
a
note
is
due
to
its
waves
are
either
simple
or
compound
thus
if
a
which
gives
waves
nearly
simple
vibrate
times
a
second
we
shall
hear
the
note
if
simultaneously
a
fork
of
vibrations
be
struck
giving
the
next
higher
octave
the
aÃ«rial
movement
at
any
time
will
be
the
algebraic
sum
of
the
movements
due
to
both
forks
whenever
both
drive
the
air
one
way
they
reinforce
one
another
when
on
the
contrary
the
recoil
of
one
fork
coincides
with
the
forward
stroke
of
another
they
detract
from
each
other
effect
the
result
is
a
movement
which
is
still
periodic
repeating
itself
at
equal
intervals
of
time
but
no
longer
since
it
is
not
alike
on
the
ascending
and
descending
limbs
of
the
curves
we
thus
get
at
the
fact
that
vibrations
may
be
produced
by
the
fusion
of
pendular
or
in
technical
phrase
by
their
suppose
several
musical
instruments
as
those
of
an
orchestra
to
be
sounded
together
each
produces
its
own
effect
on
the
whose
movements
being
an
algebraical
sum
must
at
any
given
instant
be
very
complex
yet
the
ear
can
pick
out
at
will
and
follow
the
tones
of
any
one
instrument
now
in
most
musical
instruments
it
is
susceptible
of
physical
proof
that
with
every
single
note
that
is
sounded
many
upper
octaves
and
other
sound
simultaneously
in
fainter
form
on
the
relative
strength
of
this
or
that
one
or
more
of
these
helmholtz
has
shown
that
the
instrument
peculiar
voice
depends
the
several
in
the
human
voice
also
depend
on
the
predominance
of
diverse
upper
harmonics
accompanying
the
note
on
which
the
vowel
is
sung
when
the
two
of
the
last
paragraph
are
sounded
together
the
new
form
of
vibration
has
the
same
as
the
fork
yet
the
ear
can
clearly
distinguish
the
resultant
sound
from
that
of
the
lower
fork
alone
as
a
note
of
the
same
pitch
but
of
different
timbre
and
within
the
compound
sound
the
two
components
can
by
a
trained
ear
be
severally
heard
now
how
can
one
resultant
make
us
hear
so
many
sounds
at
once
analysis
of
compound
is
supposed
after
helmholtz
to
be
effected
through
the
different
rates
of
sympathetic
resonance
of
the
different
parts
of
the
membranous
cochlea
the
basilar
membrane
is
some
twelve
times
broader
at
the
apex
of
the
cochlea
than
at
the
base
where
it
begins
and
is
largely
composed
of
radiating
fibres
which
may
be
likened
to
stretched
strings
now
the
physical
principle
of
sympathetic
resonance
says
that
when
stretched
strings
are
near
a
source
of
vibration
those
whose
own
rate
agrees
with
that
of
the
source
also
vibrate
the
others
remaining
at
rest
on
this
principle
waves
of
perilymph
running
down
the
scala
tympani
at
a
certain
rate
of
frequency
ought
to
set
certain
particular
fibres
of
the
basilar
membrane
vibrating
and
ought
to
leave
others
unaffected
if
then
each
vibrating
fibre
stimulated
the
above
it
and
no
others
and
each
such
sending
a
current
to
the
auditory
awakened
therein
a
specific
process
to
which
the
sensation
of
one
particular
pitch
was
correlated
the
physiological
condition
of
our
several
would
be
explained
suppose
now
a
chord
to
be
struck
in
which
perhaps
twenty
different
physical
rates
of
vibration
are
found
at
least
twenty
different
or
will
receive
the
jar
and
if
the
power
of
mental
discrimination
be
at
its
maximum
twenty
different
of
hearing
in
the
shape
of
as
many
distinct
pitches
of
sound
may
appear
before
the
mind
the
rods
of
corti
are
supposed
to
be
of
the
fibres
of
the
basilar
membrane
just
as
the
malleus
incus
and
stapes
are
dampers
of
the
tympanic
membrane
as
well
as
transmitters
of
its
oscillations
to
the
inner
ear
there
must
be
in
fact
an
instantaneous
of
the
physiological
vibrations
for
there
are
no
such
positive
and
no
such
blendings
of
rapidly
successive
tones
as
the
retina
shows
us
in
the
case
of
light
helmholtz
theory
of
the
analysis
of
sounds
is
plausible
and
ingenious
one
objection
to
it
is
that
the
keyboard
of
the
cochlea
does
not
seem
extensive
enough
for
the
number
of
distinct
resonances
required
we
can
discriminate
many
more
degrees
of
pitch
than
the
more
or
less
will
allow
for
fusion
of
sensations
in
a
very
common
way
of
explaining
the
fact
that
waves
which
singly
give
no
feeling
of
pitch
give
one
when
recurrent
is
to
say
that
their
several
sensations
into
a
compound
a
preferable
explanation
is
that
which
follows
the
analogy
of
muscular
contraction
if
electric
shocks
are
sent
into
a
frog
sciatic
nerve
at
slow
intervals
the
muscle
which
the
nerve
supplies
will
give
a
series
of
distinct
twitches
one
for
each
shock
but
if
they
follow
each
other
at
the
rate
of
as
many
as
thirty
a
second
no
distinct
twitches
are
observed
but
a
steady
state
of
contraction
instead
this
steady
contraction
is
known
as
the
experiment
proves
that
there
is
a
physiological
cumulation
or
overlapping
of
processes
in
the
muscular
tissue
it
takes
a
twentieth
of
a
second
or
more
for
the
latter
to
relax
after
the
twitch
due
to
the
first
shock
but
the
second
shock
comes
in
before
the
relaxation
can
occur
then
the
third
again
and
so
on
so
that
continuous
tetanus
takes
the
place
of
discrete
twitching
similarly
in
the
auditory
nerve
one
shock
of
air
starts
in
it
a
current
to
the
auditory
and
affects
the
latter
so
that
a
dry
stroke
of
sound
is
heard
if
other
shocks
follow
slowly
the
recovers
its
equilibrium
after
each
to
be
again
upset
in
the
same
way
by
the
next
and
the
result
is
that
for
each
shock
of
air
a
distinct
sensation
of
sound
occurs
but
if
the
shock
comes
in
too
quick
succession
the
later
ones
reach
the
brain
before
the
effects
of
the
earlier
ones
on
that
organ
have
died
away
there
is
thus
an
overlapping
of
processes
in
the
auditory
centre
a
physiological
condition
analogous
to
the
muscle
tetanus
to
which
new
condition
a
new
quality
of
feeling
that
of
pitch
directly
corresponds
this
latter
feeling
is
a
new
kind
of
sensation
altogether
not
a
mere
due
to
many
sensations
of
dry
stroke
being
compounded
into
one
no
sensations
of
dry
stroke
can
exist
under
these
circumstances
for
their
physiological
conditions
have
been
replaced
by
others
what
there
is
has
already
taken
place
in
the
before
the
threshold
of
sensation
was
reached
just
so
red
light
and
green
light
beating
on
the
retina
in
rapid
enough
alternation
arouse
the
central
process
to
which
the
sensation
directly
corresponds
the
sensations
of
red
and
of
green
get
no
chance
under
such
conditions
to
be
born
just
so
if
the
muscle
could
feel
it
would
have
a
certain
sort
of
feeling
when
it
gave
a
single
twitch
but
it
would
undoubtedly
have
a
distinct
sort
of
feeling
altogether
when
it
contracted
tetanically
and
this
feeling
of
the
tetanic
contraction
would
by
no
means
be
identical
with
a
multitude
of
the
feelings
of
twitching
and
when
several
tones
sound
together
we
may
get
peculiar
feelings
of
pleasure
or
displeasure
designated
as
consonance
and
dissonance
respectively
a
note
sounds
most
consonant
with
its
octave
when
with
the
octave
the
and
the
of
the
note
are
sounded
for
instance
e
g
we
get
the
chord
or
maximum
of
consonance
the
ratios
of
vibration
here
are
as
so
that
one
might
think
simple
ratios
were
the
ground
of
harmony
but
the
interval
is
discordant
with
the
comparatively
simple
ratio
helmholtz
explains
discord
by
the
overtones
making
together
this
gives
a
subtle
grating
which
is
unpleasant
where
the
overtones
make
no
or
beats
too
rapid
for
their
effect
to
be
perceptible
there
is
consonance
according
to
helmholtz
which
is
thus
a
negative
rather
than
a
positive
thing
wundt
explains
consonance
by
the
presence
of
strong
identical
overtones
in
the
notes
which
harmonize
no
one
of
these
explanations
of
musical
harmony
can
be
called
quite
satisfactory
and
the
subject
is
too
intricate
to
be
treated
farther
in
this
place
sensibility

the
weber
law

fairly
well
for
the
intensity
of
sounds
if
ivory

metal
balls
are
dropped

they
make
a

the
louder
as

in
this

illustration

it
might
be
thought
that
this
localizing
power
depended
directly
on
that
each
had
connection
with
a
special
at
one
end
the
excitation
of
which
caused
a
sensation
with
a
characteristic
local
sign
and
at
the
other
end
was
distributed
over
a
certain
and
that
the
larger
this
area
the
farther
apart
might
two
points
be
and
still
give
rise
to
only
one
sensation
if
this
were
so
however
the
peripheral
tactile
areas
each
being
determined
by
the
anatomical
distribution
of
a
must
have
definite
unchangeable
limits
which
experiment
shows
that
they
do
not
possess
suppose
the
small
areas
in
fig
to
each
represent
a
peripheral
area
of
if
any
two
points
in
were
touched
we
should
according
to
the
theory
get
but
a
single
sensation
but
if
while
the
remained
the
same
distance
apart
or
were
even
approximated
one
were
placed
in
and
the
other
on
a
contiguous
area
two
fibres
would
be
stimulated
and
we
ought
to
get
two
sensations
but
such
is
not
the
case
on
the
same
the
points
must
be
always
the
same
distance
apart
no
matter
how
they
be
shifted
in
order
to
give
rise
to
two
just
distinguishable
sensations
it
is
probable
that
the
are
much
smaller
than
the
tactile
and
that
several
unstimulated
must
intervene
between
the
excited
in
order
to
produce
sensations
which
shall
be
distinct
if
we
suppose
twelve
unexcited
must
intervene
then
in
fig
and
will
be
just
on
the
limits
of
a
single
tactile
area
and
no
matter
how
the
points
are
moved
so
long
as
eleven
or
fewer
unexcited
areas
come
between
we
would
get
a
single
tactile
sensation
in
this
way
we
can
explain
the
fact
that
tactile
areas
have
no
fixed
boundaries
in
the
skin
although
the
in
any
part
must
be
constant
we
also
see
why
the
back
of
a
knife
laid
on
the
surface
causes
a
continuous
linear
sensation
although
it
touches
many
distinct
if
we
could
discriminate
the
excitations
of
each
of
these
from
that
of
its
immediate
neighbors
we
should
get
the
sensation
of
a
series
of
points
touching
us
one
for
each
excited
but
in
the
absence
of
intervening
unexcited
the
sensations
are
fused
together

also
on

a

the
change
of

about
by
changes
in

to
its

internal

feels

uncomfortably
warm

is
not

the
exercise
has
accelerated
his
circulation
and
tended
to
warm
his
skin

the
moving
outer
air
has
rapidly
conducted
off
the
extra
heat
on
entering
the
house
the
stationary
air
there
does
this
less
quickly
the
skin
gets
hot
and
the
cause
is
supposed
to
be
oppressive
heat
of
the
room
hence
frequently
opening
windows
and
sitting
in
a
draught
with
its
concomitant
risks
whereas
keeping
quiet
for
five
or
ten
minutes
until
the
circulation
has
returned
to
its
normal
rate
would
attain
the
same
end
without

the
acuteness
of
the

greatest

temperatures
within
a
few
degrees
of
at
these
differences
of
less
than
can
be
discriminated
as
a
means
of
measuring
absolute
temperatures
however
the
skin
is
very
unreliable
on
account
of
the
changeability
of
its
we
can
localize
much
as
tactile
but
not
so
accurately
the
sensation
in
the
muscle
itself
can
not
well
be
distinguished
from
that
in
the
tendon
or
in
its
insertion
in
muscular
fatigue
the
insertions
are
the
places
most
painfully
felt
in
muscular
rheumatism
however
the
whole
muscle
grows
painful
and
violent
contraction
such
as
that
caused
by

both

the

in
a
network
great
importance
has
been
attached
to
the
muscular
sense
as
a
factor
in
our
perceptions
not
only
of
weight
and
pressure
but
of
the
between
things
generally
our
eyes
and
our
hands
in
their
explorations
of
space
move
over
it
and
through
it
it
is
usually
supposed
that
without
this
sense
of
an
intervening
motion
performed
we
should
not
perceive
two
seen
points
or
two
touched
points
to
be
separated
by
an
extended
interval
i
am
far
from
denying
the
immense
participation
of
experiences
of
motion
in
the
construction
of
our
but
it
is
still
an
open
question
our
muscles
help
us
in
these
experiences
whether
by
their
own
sensations
or
by
awakening
sensations
of
motion
on
our
skin
retina
and
articular
surfaces
the
latter
seems
to
me
the
more
probable
view
and
the
reader
may
be
of
the
same
opinion
after
reading
chapter
vi
to
when
we
wish
to
estimate
accurately
the
weight
of
an
object
we
always
when
possible
lift
it
and
so
combine
muscular
and
articular
with
tactile
sensations
by
this
means
we
can
form
much
better
judgments

the
physiology
of
pain
is
still
an
enigma
one
might
suppose
separate
afferent
fibres
with
their
own
to
carry
painful
impressions
to
a
specific
or
one
might
suppose
such
a
specific
centre
to
be
reached
by
currents
of
overflow
from
the
other
sensory
centres
when
the
violence
of
their
inner
excitement
should
have
reached
a
certain
pitch
or
again
one
might
suppose
a
certain
extreme
degree
of
inner
excitement
to
produce
the
feeling
of
pain
in
all
the
centres
it
is
certain
that
sensations
of
every
order
which
in
moderate
degrees
are
rather
pleasant
than
otherwise
become
painful
when
their
intensity
grows
strong
the
rate
at
which
the
agreeableness
and
disagreeableness
vary
with
the
intensity
of
a
sensation
is
roughly
represented
by
the
dotted
curve
in
fig
the
horizontal
line
represents
the
threshold
both
of
sensational
and
of
agreeable
sensibility
below
the
line
is
the
disagreeble
the
continuous
curve
is
that
of
weber
law
which
we
learned
to
know
in
fig
with
the
minimal
sensation
the
agreeableness
is
as
the
dotted
curve
shows
it
rises
at
first
more
slowly
than
the
sensational
intensity
then
faster
and
reaches
its
maximum
before
the
sensation
is
near
its
acme
after
its
maximum
of
agreeableness
the
dotted
line
rapidly
sinks
and
soon
tumbles
below
the
horizontal
into
the
realm
of
the
disagreeable
or
painful
in
which
it
declines
that
all
sensations
are
painful
when
too
strong
is
a
piece
of
familiar
knowledge
light
sound
odors
the
taste
of
sweet
even
cold
heat
and
all
the
must
be
moderate
to
be
enjoyed
the
quality
of
the
sensation
complicates
the
question
however
for
in
some
sensations
as
bitter
sour
salt
and
certain
smells
the
turning
point
of
the
dotted
curve
must
be
drawn
very
near
indeed
to
the
beginning
of
the
scale
in
the
skin
the
painful
quality
soon
becomes
so
intense
as
entirely
to
overpower
the
specific
quality
of
the
sort
of
stimulus
heat
cold
and
pressure
are
indistinguishable
when
extreme
we
only
feel
the
pain
the
hypothesis
of
separate
in
the
skin
receives
some
corroboration
from
recent
experiments
for
both
blix
and
goldscheider
have
found
along
with
their
special
cold
spots
also
special
on
the
skin
mixed
in
with
these
are
spots
which
are
quite
feelingless
however
it
may
stand
with
the
terminal
separate
paths
of
to
the
brain
for
painful
and
for
merely
tactile
stimulations
of
the
skin
are
made
probable
by
certain
facts
in
the
condition
termed
a
touch
is
felt
but
the
most
violent
pinch
burn
or
electric
spark
destructive
of
the
tissue
will
awaken
no
sensation
this
may
occur
in
disease
of
the
cord
by
suggestion
in
hypnotism
or
in
certain
stages
of
ether
and
chloroform
intoxication
in
rabbits
a
similar
state
of
things
was
produced
by
schiff
by
dividing
the
gray
matter
of
the
cord
leaving
the
posterior
white
columns
intact
if
on
the
contrary
the
latter
were
divided
and
the
gray
substance
left
there
was
increased
sensitiveness
to
pain
and
possibly
touch
proper
was
lost
such
experiments
make
it
pretty
certain
that
when
afferent
impulses
reach
the
spinal
cord
at
any
level
and
there
enter
its
gray
matter
with
the
posterior
they
travel
on
in
different
tracts
to
conscious
centres
the
tactile
ones
coming
soon
out
of
the
gray
network
and
coursing
on
in
a
readily
conducting
white
fibre
while
the
painful
ones
travel
on
farther
in
the
gray
substance
it
is
still
uncertain
if
both
impulses
reach
the
cord
in
the
same
fibres
the
gray
network
conducts
but
not
easily
they
tend
soon
to
be
blocked
in
it
a
feeble
tactile
impulse
reaching
it
by
an
afferent
fibre
might
only
spread
a
short
way
and
then
pass
out
into
a
single
good
conducting
fibre
in
a
white
column
and
proceed
to
the
brain
while
a
stronger
painful
impulse
would
radiate
farther
in
the
gray
matter
and
perhaps
break
out
of
it
by
many
fibres
leading
to
the
brain
through
the
white
columns
and
so
give
rise
to
an
incoÃ¶rdinate
and
sensation
that
pains
are
badly
localized
and
worse
the
more
intense
they
are
is
a
fact
which
would
thus
receive
an
explanation
pain
also
gives
rise
to
movements
of
defence
the
stronger
the
pain
the
more
violent
the
start
doubtless
in
low
animals
pain
is
almost
the
only
stimulus
and
we
have
preserved
the
peculiarity
in
so
far
that
it
is
the
stimulus
of
our
most
energetic
though
not
of
our
most
discriminating
reactions
smell
as
well
as
hunger
thirst

sensations
of
motion
i
treat
of
these
in
a
separate
chapter
in
order
to
give
them
the
emphasis
which
their
importance
deserves
they
are
of
two
orders
sensations
of
objects
moving
over
our
sensory
surfaces
and
sensations
of
our
whole
person
translation
through
space
the
sensation
of
motion
over
this
has
generally
been
assumed
by
physiologists
to
be
impossible
until
the
positions
of
a
and
ad
are
severally
cognized
and
the
successive
occupancies
of
these
positions
by
the
moving
body
are
perceived
to
be
separated
by
a
distinct
interval
of
time
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
we
cognize
only
the
very
slowest
motions
in
this
way
seeing
the
hand
of
a
clock
at
xii
and
afterwards
at
vi
i
judge
that
it
has
moved
through
the
interval
seeing
the
sun
now
in
the
east
and
again
in
the
west
i
infer
it
to
have
passed
over
my
head
but
we
can
only
that
which
we
already
generically
know
in
some
more
direct
fashion
and
it
is
experimentally
certain
that
we
have
the
feeling
of
motion
given
us
as
a
direct
and
simple
czermak
long
ago
pointed
out
the
difference
between
the
of
the
of
a
watch
when
we
look
directly
at
it
and
noticing
the
fact
that
it
has
its
whilst
our
gaze
is
fixed
upon
some
other
point
of
the
in
the
first
case
we
have
a
specific
quality
of
sensation
which
is
absent
in
the
second
if
the
reader
will
find
a
portion
of
his
skin
the
arm
for
example
where
a
pair
of
an
inch
apart
are
felt
as
one
impression
and
if
he
will
then
trace
lines
a
tenth
of
an
inch
long
on
that
spot
with
a
he
will
be
distinctly
aware
of
the
point
motion
and
vaguely
aware
of
the
direction
of
the
motion
the
perception
of
the
motion
here
is
certainly
not
derived
from
a
preÃ«xisting
knowledge
that
its
starting
and
ending
points
are
separate
positions
in
space
because
positions
in
space
ten
times
wider
apart
fail
to
be
discriminated
as
such
when
excited
by
the
it
is
the
same
with
the
retina
one
fingers
when
cast
upon
its
peripheral
portions
can
not
be
counted
that
is
to
say
the
five
retinal
tracts
which
they
occupy
are
not
distinctly
apprehended
by
the
mind
as
five
separate
positions
in
space
and
yet
the
slightest
of
the
fingers
is
most
vividly
perceived
as
movement
and
nothing
else
it
is
thus
certain
that
our
sense
of
movement
being
so
much
more
delicate
than
our
sense
of
position
can
not
possibly
be
derived
from
it
at
almost
the
same
time
called
attention
to
certain
persistent
illusions
amongst
which
are
if
another
person
gently
trace
a
line
across
our
wrist
or
finger
the
latter
being
stationary
it
will
feel
to
us
as
if
the
member
were
moving
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
tracing
point
if
on
the
contrary
we
move
our
limb
across
a
fixed
point
it
will
seem
as
if
the
point
were
moving
as
well
if
the
reader
will
touch
his
forehead
with
his
forefinger
kept
motionless
and
then
rotate
the
head
so
that
the
skin
of
the
forehead
passes
beneath
the
finger
tip
he
will
have
an
irresistible
sensation
of
the
latter
being
itself
in
motion
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
head
so
in
abducting
the
fingers
from
each
other
some
may
move
and
the
rest
be
still
but
the
still
ones
will
feel
as
if
they
were
actively
separating
from
the
rest
these
illusions
according
to
vierordt
are
survivals
of
a
primitive
form
of
perception
when
motion
was
felt
as
such
but
ascribed
to
the
whole
of
consciousness
and
not
yet
distinguished
as
belonging
exclusively
to
one
of
its
parts
when
our
perception
is
fully
developed
we
go
beyond
the
mere
relative
motion
of
thing
and
ground
and
can
ascribe
absolute
motion
to
one
of
these
components
of
our
total
object
and
absolute
rest
to
another
when
in
vision
for
example
the
whole
field
of
view
seems
to
move
together
we
think
it
is
ourselves
or
our
eyes
which
are
moving
and
any
object
in
the
foreground
which
may
seem
to
move
relatively
to
the
background
is
judged
by
us
to
be
really
still
but
primitively
this
discrimination
is
not
perfectly
made
the
sensation
of
the
motion
spreads
over
all
that
we
see
and
infects
it
any
relative
motion
of
object
and
retina
both
makes
the
object
seem
to
move
and
makes
us
feel
ourselves
in
motion
even
now
when
our
whole
field
of
view
really
does
move
we
get
giddy
and
feel
as
if
we
too
were
moving
and
we
still
see
an
apparent
motion
of
the
entire
field
of
view
whenever
we
suddenly
jerk
our
head
and
eyes
or
shake
them
quickly
to
and
fro
pushing
our
eyeballs
gives
the
same
illusion
we
in
all
these
cases
what
really
happens
but
the
conditions
are
unusual
so
our
primitive
sensation
persists
unchecked
so
it
does
when
clouds
float
by
the
moon
we
the
moon
is
still
but
we
it
move
faster
than
the
clouds
even
when
we
slowly
move
our
eyes
the
primitive
sensation
persists
under
the
victorious
conception
if
we
notice
closely
the
experience
we
find
that
any
object
towards
which
we
look
appears
moving
to
meet
our
eye
but
the
most
valuable
contribution
to
the
subject
is
the
paper
of
schneider
who
takes
up
the
matter
zoÃ¶logically
and
shows
by
examples
from
every
branch
of
the
animal
kingdom
that
movement
is
the
quality
by
which
animals
most
easily
attract
each
other
attention
the
instinct
of
death
is
no
shamming
of
death
at
all
but
rather
a
paralysis
through
fear
which
saves
the
insect
crustacean
or
other
creature
from
being
at
by
his
enemy
it
is
paralleled
in
the
human
race
by
the
stillness
of
the
boy
playing
spy
to
whom
the
seeker
is
near
and
its
obverse
side
is
shown
in
our
involuntary
waving
of
arms
jumping
up
and
down
and
so
forth
when
we
wish
to
attract
someone
attention
at
a
distance
creatures
their
prey
and
creatures
hiding
from
their
pursuers
alike
show
how
immobility
diminishes
conspicuity
in
the
woods
if
we
are
quiet
the
squirrels
and
birds
will
actually
touch
us
flies
will
light
on
stuffed
birds
and
stationary
frogs
on
the
other
hand
the
tremendous
shock
of
feeling
the
thing
we
are
sitting
on
begin
to
move
the
exaggerated
start
it
gives
us
to
have
an
insect
unexpectedly
pass
over
our
skin
or
a
cat
noiselessly
come
and
snuffle
about
our
hand
the
excessive
reflex
effects
of
tickling
show
how
exciting
the
sensation
of
motion
is
a
kitten
can
not
help
pursuing
a
moving
ball
impressions
too
faint
to
be
cognized
at
all
are
immediately
felt
if
they
move
a
fly
sitting
is
unnoticed
we
feel
it
the
moment
it
crawls
a
shadow
may
be
too
faint
to
be
perceived
if
we
hold
a
finger
between
our
closed
eyelid
and
the
sunshine
we
do
not
notice
its
presence
the
moment
we
move
it
to
and
fro
however
we
discern
it
such
visual
perception
as
this
reproduces
the
conditions
of
sight
among
the
radiates
in
ourselves
the
main
function
of
the
peripheral
parts
of
the
retina
is
that
of
sentinels
which
when
beams
of
light
move
over
them
cry
goes
there
and
call
the
fovea
to
the
spot
most
parts
of
the
skin
do
but
perform
the
same
office
for
the
of
course
of
surface
under
object
is
for
purposes
of
stimulation
equivalent
to
movement
of
object
over
in
exploring
the
shapes
and
sizes
of
things
by
either
eye
or
skin
the
movements
of
these
organs
are
incessant
and
unrestrainable
every
such
movement
draws
the
points
and
lines
of
the
object
across
the
surface
imprints
them
a
hundred
times
more
sharply
and
drives
them
home
to
the
attention
the
immense
part
thus
played
by
movements
in
our
perceptive
activity
is
held
by
many
psychologists
to
prove
that
the
muscles
are
themselves
the
organ
not
but
muscular
sense
is
for
these
writers
the
original
and
only
revealer
of
objective
extension
but
they
have
all
failed
to
notice
with
what
peculiar
intensity
muscular
movements
call
into
play
and
how
largely
the
mere
discernment
of
impressions
depends
on
the
mobility
of
the
surfaces
upon
which
they
fall
our
surfaces
are
tactile
which
become
intensely
painful
when
inflamed
besides
pressure
only
stimulus
they
receive
is
their
motion
upon
each
to
the
sensation
of
this
motion
more
than
anything
else
seems
due
the
perception
of
the
position
which
our
limbs
may
have
assumed
patients
cutaneously
and
muscularly
anÃ¦sthetic
in
one
leg
can
often
prove
that
their
articular
sensibility
remains
by
showing
by
movements
of
their
well
leg
the
positions
in
which
the
surgeon
may
place
their
insensible
one
goldscheider
in
berlin
caused
fingers
arms
and
legs
to
be
passively
rotated
upon
their
various
joints
in
a
mechanical
apparatus
which
registered
both
the
velocity
of
movement
impressed
and
the
amount
of
angular
rotation
the
minimal
felt
amounts
of
rotation
were
much
less
than
a
single
angular
degree
in
all
the
joints
except
those
of
the
fingers
such
displacements
as
these
goldscheider
says
can
hardly
be
detected
by
the
eye
anÃ¦sthesia
of
the
skin
produced
by
had
no
disturbing
effect
on
the
perception
nor
did
the
various
degrees
of
pressure
of
the
moving
force
upon
the
skin
affect
it
it
became
in
fact
all
the
more
distinct
in
proportion
as
the
concomitant
were
eliminated
by
artificial
anÃ¦sthesia
when
the
joints
themselves
however
were
made
artificially
anÃ¦sthetic
the
perception
of
the
movement
grew
obtuse
and
the
angular
rotations
had
to
be
much
increased
before
they
were
perceptible
all
these
facts
prove
according
to
herr
goldscheider
that
and
these
alone
are
the
seat
of
the
impressions
by
which
the
movements
of
our
members
are
immediately
sensations
of
movement
through
these
may
be
divided
into
feelings
of
rotation
and
feelings
of
translation
as
was
stated
at
the
end
of
the
chapter
on
the
ear
the
labyrinth
semicircular
canals
utricle
and
saccule
seems
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
hearing
it
is
conclusively
established
that
the
semicircular
canals
are
the
organs
of
a
sixth
special
sense
that
namely
of
rotation
when
subjectively
excited
this
sensation
is
known
as
or
and
rapidly
engenders
the
farther
feeling
of
nausea
irritative
disease
of
the
inner
ear
causes
intense
vertigo
disease
traumatic
irritation
of
the
canals
in
birds
and
mammals
makes
the
animals
tumble
and
throw
themselves
about
in
a
way
best
explained
by
supposing
them
to
suffer
from
false
sensations
of
falling
which
they
compensate
by
reflex
muscular
acts
that
throw
them
the
other
way
galvanic
irritation
of
the
membranous
canals
in
pigeons
cause
just
the
same
compensatory
movements
of
head
and
eye
which
actual
rotations
impressed
on
the
creatures
produce
deaf
and
dumb
persons
amongst
whom
many
must
have
had
their
auditory
nerves
or
labyrinths
destroyed
by
the
same
disease
which
took
away
their
hearing
are
in
a
very
large
percentage
of
cases
found
quite
insusceptible
of
being
made
dizzy
by
rotation
purkinje
and
mach
have
shown
that
whatever
the
organ
of
the
sense
of
rotation
may
be
it
must
have
its
seat
in
the
head
the
body
is
excluded
by
mach
elaborate
experiments
the
semicircular
canals
being
as
it
were
six
little
in
three
rectangular
planes
seem
admirably
adapted
to
be
organs
of
a
sense
of
rotation
we
need
only
suppose
that
when
the
head
turns
in
the
plane
of
any
one
of
them
the
relative
inertia
of
the
endolymph
momentarily
increases
its
pressure
on
the
in
the
appropriate
ampulla
which
pressure
starts
a
current
towards
the
central
organ
for
feeling
vertigo
this
organ
seems
to
be
the
cerebellum
and
the
teleology
of
the
whole
business
would
appear
to
be
the
maintenance
of
the
upright
position
if
a
man
stand
with
shut
eyes
and
attend
to
his
body
he
will
find
that
he
is
hardly
for
a
moment
in
equilibrium
incipient
fallings
towards
every
side
in
succession
are
incessantly
repaired
by
muscular
contractions
which
restore
the
balance
and
although
impressions
on
the
tendons
ligaments
joints
doubtless
are
among
the
causes
of
the
compensatory
contractions
yet
the
strongest
and
most
special
reflex
arc
would
seem
to
be
that
which
has
the
sensation
of
incipient
vertigo
for
its
afferent
member
this
is
experimentally
proved
to
be
much
more
easily
excited
than
the
other
sensations
referred
to
when
the
cerebellum
is
disorganized
the
reflex
response
fails
to
occur
properly
and
loss
of
equilibrium
is
the
result
irritation
of
the
cerebellum
produces
vertigo
loss
of
balance
and
nausea
and
galvanic
currents
through
the
head
produce
various
forms
of
vertigo
correlated
with
their
direction
it
seems
probable
that
direct
excitement
of
the
cerebellar
centre
is
responsible
for
these
feelings
in
addition
to
these
corporeal
reflexes
the
sense
of
rotation
causes
compensatory
rollings
of
the
eyeballs
in
the
opposite
direction
to
which
some
of
the
subjective
phenomena
of
are
due
steady
rotation
gives
no
sensation
it
is
only
starting
or
stopping
or
more
generally
speaking
acceleration
positive
or
negative
which
impresses
the
in
the
ampullÃ¦
the
sensation
always
has
a
little
duration
however
and
the
feeling
of
reversed
movement
after
whirling
violently
may
last
for
nearly
a
minute
slowly
fading
out
the
cause
of
the
of
movement
forwards
or
backwards
is
more
open
to
dispute
the
seat
of
this
sensation
has
been
assigned
to
the
semicircular
canals
when
compounding
their
currents
to
the
brain
and
also
to
the
utricle
the
latest
experimenter
delage
considers
that
it
can
not
possibly
be
in
the
head
and
assigns
it
rather
to
the
entire
body
so
far
as
its
parts
viscera
etc
are
movable
against
each
other
and
suffer
friction
or
pressure
from
their
relative
inertia
when
a
movement
of
translation
begins
exclusion
of
the
labyrinth
from
this
form
of
sensibility
can
not
however
yet
be
considered
definitively
established
so
the
matter
may
rest

the

formed
by

their

and
from

one
can
learn
all
that
is
essential
in

the
student
is
therefore
strongly
urged
to
dissect

for
the
use
of

who
can
not
procure
these

i
subjoin
a
few
practical
notes
the
instruments
needed
are
a
small
saw
a
chisel
with
a
shoulder
and
a
hammer
with
a
hook
on
its
handle
all
three
of
which
form
part
of
the
regular
medical
and
can
be
had
of
in
addition
a
scalpel
a
pair
of
scissors
a
pair
of
and
a
silver
probe
are
required
the
solitary
student
can
find
substitutes
for
all
these
things
but
the
forceps
which
he
ought
to
buy
the
first
thing
is
to
get
off
the
make
two
through
the
prominent
portion
of
each
condyle
or
articular
surface
bounding
the
hole
at
the
back
of
the
skull
where
the
spinal
cord
enters
and
passing
forwards
to
the
temples
of
the
animal
then
make
two
cuts
one
on
each
side
which
cross
these
and
meet
in
an
angle
on
the
frontal
bone
by
actual
trial
one
will
find
the
best
direction
for
the
it
is
hard
to
saw
entirely
through
the
without
in
some
places
also
sawing

here
is

the
chisel
comes

can
break
by
a
smart
blow
on
it
with
the
hammer
any
parts
of
the
skull
not
quite
sawn
through
when
the

ready
to
come
off
one
will
feel
it
insert
then
the
hook
under
its
forward
end
and
pull
firmly
the

will
come
away
leaving

now
be

probably
examine
the

of

any
one
of

let
him

draw

the
functions
of
the
brain
idea
of
nervous
if
i
begin
chopping
the
foot
of
a
tree
its
branches
are
unmoved
by
my
act
and
its
leaves
murmur
as
peacefully
as
ever
in
the
wind
if
on
the
contrary
i
do
violence
to
the
foot
of
a
the
rest
of
his
body
instantly
responds
to
the
aggression
by
movements
of
alarm
or
defence
the
reason
of
this
difference
is
that
the
man
has
a
nervous
system
whilst
the
tree
has
none
and
the
function
of
the
nervous
system
is
to
bring
each
part
into
harmonious
coÃ¶peration
with
every
other
the
afferent
nerves
when
excited
by
some
physical
irritant
be
this
as
gross
in
its
mode
of
operation
as
a
chopping
axe
or
as
subtle
as
the
waves
of
light
conveys
the
excitement
to
the
nervous
centres
the
commotion
set
up
in
the
centres
does
not
stop
there
but
discharges
through
the
efferent
nerves
exciting
movements
which
vary
with
the
animal
and
with
the
irritant
applied
these
acts
of
response
have
usually
the
common
character
of
being
of
service
they
ward
off
the
noxious
stimulus
and
support
the
beneficial
one
whilst
if
in
itself
indifferent
the
stimulus
be
a
sign
of
some
distant
circumstance
of
practical
importance
the
animal
acts
are
addressed
to
this
circumstance
so
as
to
avoid
its
perils
or
secure
its
benefits
as
the
case
may
be
to
take
a
common
example
if
i
hear
the
conductor
calling
aboard
as
i
enter
the
station
my
heart
first
stops
then
palpitates
and
my
legs
respond
to
the
falling
on
my
tympanum
by
quickening
their
movements
if
i
stumble
as
i
run
the
sensation
of
falling
provokes
a
movement
of
the
hands
towards
the
direction
of
the
fall
the
effect
of
which
is
to
shield
the
body
from
too
sudden
a
shock
if
a
cinder
enter
my
eye
its
lids
close
forcibly
and
a
copious
flow
of
tears
tends
to
wash
it
out
these
three
responses
to
a
sensational
stimulus
differ
however
in
many
respects
the
closure
of
the
eye
and
the
lachrymation
are
quite
involuntary
and
so
is
the
disturbance
of
the
heart
such
involuntary
responses
we
know
as
acts
the
motion
of
the
arms
to
break
the
shock
of
falling
may
also
be
called
reflex
since
it
occurs
too
quickly
to
be
deliberately
intended
it
is
at
any
rate
less
automatic
than
the
previous
acts
for
a
man
might
by
conscious
effort
learn
to
perform
it
more
skilfully
or
even
to
suppress
it
altogether
actions
of
this
kind
into
which
instinct
and
volition
enter
upon
equal
terms
have
been
called
the
act
of
running
towards
the
train
on
the
other
hand
has
no
instinctive
element
about
it
it
is
purely
the
result
of
education
and
is
preceded
by
a
consciousness
of
the
purpose
to
be
attained
and
a
distinct
mandate
of
the
will
it
is
a
act
thus
the
animal
reflex
and
voluntary
performances
shade
into
each
other
gradually
being
connected
by
acts
which
may
often
occur
automatically
but
may
also
be
modified
by
conscious
intelligence
frog
let
us
now
look
a
little
more
closely
at
what
goes
on
the
best
way
to
enter
the
subject
will
be
to
take
a
lower
creature
like
a
frog
and
study
by
the
vivisectional
method
the
functions
of
his
different
the
frog
are
figured
in
the
diagram
over
the
page
which
needs
no
further
explanation
i
shall
first
proceed
to
state
what
happens
when
various
amounts
of
the
anterior
parts
are
removed
in
different
frogs
in
the
way
in
which
an
ordinary
student
removes
them
that
is
with
no
extreme
precautions
as
to
the
purity
of
the
operation
if
then
we
reduce
the
frog
nervous
system
to
the
spinal
cord
alone
by
making
a
section
behind
the
base
of
the
skull
between
the
spinal
cord
and
the
medulla
oblongata
thereby
cutting
off
the
brain
from
all
connection
with
the
rest
of
the
body
the
frog
will
still
continue
to
live
but
with
a
very
peculiarly
modified
activity
it
ceases
to
breathe
or
swallow
it
lies
flat
on
its
belly
and
does
not
like
a
normal
frog
sit
up
on
its
forepaws
though
its
are
kept
as
usual
folded
against
its
body
and
immediately
resume
this
position
if
drawn
out
if
thrown
on
its
back
it
lies
there
quietly
without
turning
over
like
a
normal
frog
locomotion
and
voice
seem
entirely
abolished
if
we
suspend
it
by
the
nose
and
irritate
different
portions
of
its
skin
by
acid
it
performs
a
set
of
remarkable
movements
calculated
to
wipe
away
the
irritant
thus
if
the
breast
be
touched
both
will
rub
it
vigorously
if
we
touch
the
outer
side
of
the
elbow
the
of
the
same
side
will
rise
directly
to
the
spot
and
wipe
it
the
back
of
the
foot
will
rub
the
knee
if
that
be
attacked
whilst
if
the
foot
be
cut
away
the
stump
will
make
ineffectual
movements
and
then
in
many
frogs
a
pause
will
come
as
if
for
deliberation
succeeded
by
a
rapid
passage
of
the
opposite
unmutilated
foot
to
the
acidulated
spot

spinal
the
most
striking
character
of
all
these
movements
after
their
teleological
appropriateness
is
their
precision
they
vary
in
sensitive
frogs
and
with
a
proper
amount
of
irritation
so
little
as
almost
to
resemble
in
their
regularity
the
performances
of
a
whose
legs
must
twitch
whenever
you
pull
the
string
the
spinal
cord
of
the
frog
thus
contains
arrangements
of
cells
and
fibres
fitted
to
convert
into
movements
of
defence
we
may
call
it
the
for
defensive
in
this
animal
we
may
indeed
go
farther
than
this
and
by
cutting
the
spinal
cord
in
various
places
find
that
its
separate
segments
are
independent
mechanisms
for
appropriate
activities
of
the
head
and
of
the
arms
and
legs
respectively
the
segment
governing
the
arms
is
especially
active
in
male
frogs
in
the
breeding
season
and
these
members
alone
with
the
breast
and
back
appertaining
to
them
and
everything
else
cut
away
will
actively
grasp
a
finger
placed
between
them
and
remain
hanging
to
it
for
a
considerable
time
similarly
of
the
medulla
oblongata
optic
lobes
and
other
centres
between
the
spinal
cord
and
the
hemispheres
of
the
frog
each
of
them
is
proved
by
experiment
to
contain
a
mechanism
for
the
accurate
execution
in
response
to
definite
stimuli
of
certain
special
acts
thus
with
the
medulla
the
animal
swallows
with
the
medulla
and
cerebellum
together
he
jumps
swims
and
turns
over
from
his
back
with
his
optic
lobes
he
croaks
when
pinched
etc
frog
which
has
lost
his
cerebral
hemispheres
alone
is
by
an
unpractised
observer
indistinguishable
from
a
normal
not
only
is
he
capable
on
proper
instigation
of
all
the
acts
already
mentioned
but
he
guides
himself
by
sight
so
that
if
an
obstacle
be
set
up
between
him
and
the
light
and
he
be
forced
to
move
forward
he
either
jumps
over
it
or
swerves
to
one
side
he
manifests
the
sexual
instinct
at
the
proper
seasons
and
discriminates
between
male
and
female
individuals
of
his
own
species
he
is
in
short
so
similar
in
every
respect
to
a
normal
frog
that
it
would
take
a
person
very
familiar
with
these
animals
to
suspect
anything
wrong
or
wanting
about
him
but
even
then
such
a
person
would
soon
remark
the
almost
entire
absence
of
spontaneous
motion
that
is
motion
unprovoked
by
any
present
incitation
of
sense
the
continued
movements
of
swimming
performed
by
the
creature
in
the
water
seem
to
be
the
fatal
result
of
the
contact
of
that
fluid
with
its
skin
they
cease
when
a
stick
for
example
touches
his
hands
this
is
a
sensible
irritant
towards
which
the
feet
are
automatically
drawn
by
reflex
action
and
on
which
the
animal
remains
sitting
he
manifests
no
hunger
and
will
suffer
a
fly
to
crawl
over
his
nose
unsnapped
at
fear
too
seems
to
have
deserted
him
in
a
word
he
is
an
extremely
complex
machine
whose
actions
so
far
as
they
go
tend
to
but
still
a
in
this
sense
that
it
seems
to
contain
no
incalculable
element
by
applying
the
right
sensory
stimulus
to
him
we
are
almost
as
certain
of
getting
a
fixed
response
as
an
organist
is
of
hearing
a
certain
tone
when
he
pulls
out
a
certain
stop
now
if
to
the
lower
centres
we
add
the
cerebral
or
if
in
other
words
we
make
an
intact
animal
the
subject
of
our
observations
all
this
is
changed
in
addition
to
the
previous
responses
to
present
incitements
of
sense
our
frog
now
goes
through
long
and
complex
acts
of
locomotion
or
as
if
moved
by
what
in
ourselves
we
should
call
an
idea
his
reactions
to
outward
stimuli
vary
their
form
too
instead
of
making
simple
defensive
movements
with
his
like
a
headless
frog
if
touched
or
of
giving
one
or
two
leaps
and
then
sitting
still
like
a
hemisphereless
one
he
makes
persistent
and
varied
efforts
of
escape
as
if
not
the
mere
contact
of
the
physiologist
hand
but
the
notion
of
danger
suggested
by
it
were
now
his
spur
led
by
the
feeling
of
hunger
too
he
goes
in
search
of
insects
fish
or
smaller
frogs
and
varies
his
procedure
with
each
species
of
victim
the
physiologist
can
not
by
manipulating
him
elicit
croaking
crawling
up
a
board
swimming
or
stopping
at
will
his
conduct
has
become
incalculable
we
can
no
longer
foretell
it
exactly
effort
to
escape
is
his
dominant
reaction
but
he
do
anything
else
even
swell
up
and
become
perfectly
passive
in
our
hands
such
are
the
phenomena
commonly
observed
and
such
the
impressions
which
one
naturally
receives
certain
general
conclusions
follow
irresistibly
first
of
all
the
following
acts
of
all
the
centres
involve
the
use
of
the
same
when
a
brainless
frog
wipes
the
acid
he
calls
into
play
all
the
which
a
frog
with
his
full
medulla
oblongata
and
cerebellum
uses
when
he
turns
from
his
back
to
his
belly
their
contractions
are
however
differently
in
the
two
cases
so
that
the
results
vary
widely
we
must
consequently
conclude
that
specific
arrangements
of
cells
and
fibres
exist
in
the
cord
for
wiping
in
the
medulla
for
turning
over
etc
similarly
they
exist
in
the
thalami
for
jumping
over
seen
obstacles
and
for
balancing
the
moved
body
in
the
optic
lobes
for
creeping
backwards
or
what
not
but
in
the
hemispheres
since
the
presence
of
these
organs
no
new
elementary
form
of
with
it
but
only
differently
the
on
which
the
movements
shall
occur
making
the
usual
stimuli
less
fatal
and
we
need
suppose
no
such
machinery
coÃ¶rdinative
of
muscular
contractions
to
exist
we
may
rather
assume
when
the
mandate
for
a
is
sent
forth
by
the
hemispheres
that
a
current
goes
straight
to
the
in
the
spinal
cord
exciting
this
arrangement
as
a
whole
similarly
if
an
intact
frog
wishes
to
jump
all
he
need
do
is
to
excite
from
the
hemispheres
the
in
the
thalami
or
wherever
it
may
be
and
the
latter
will
provide
for
the
details
of
the
execution
it
is
like
a
general
ordering
a
colonel
to
make
a
certain
movement
but
not
telling
him
how
it
shall
be
done
same
muscle
then
is
repeatedly
represented
at
different
and
at
each
it
enters
into
a
different
combination
with
other
muscles
to
coÃ¶perate
in
some
special
form
of
concerted
movement
at
each
height
the
movement
is
discharged
by
some
particular
form
of
sensorial
stimulus
whilst
the
stimuli
which
discharge
the
hemispheres
would
seem
not
so
much
to
be
elementary
sorts
of
sensation
as
groups
of
sensations
forming
determinate
or
pigeon
lower
the
results
are
just
the
same
if
instead
of
a
frog
we
take
a
pigeon
cut
out
his
hemispheres
carefully
and
wait
till
he
recovers
from
the
operation
there
is
not
a
movement
natural
to
him
which
this
brainless
bird
can
not
execute
he
seems
too
after
some
days
to
execute
movements
from
some
inner
irritation
for
he
moves
spontaneously
but
his
emotions
and
instincts
exist
no
longer
in
schrader
striking
words
the
hemisphereless
animal
moves
in
a
world
of
bodies
which
are
all
of
equal
value
for
him
he
is
to
use
goltz
apt
expression
every
object
is
for
him
only
a
mass
he
turns
out
of
his
path
for
an
ordinary
pigeon
no
otherwise
than
for
a
stone
he
may
try
to
climb
over
both
all
authors
agree
that
they
never
found
any
difference
whether
it
was
an
inanimate
body
a
cat
a
dog
or
a
bird
of
prey
which
came
in
their
pigeon
way
the
creature
knows
neither
friends
nor
enemies
in
the
thickest
company
it
lives
like
a
hermit
the
languishing
cooing
of
the
male
awakens
no
more
impression
than
the
rattling
of
the
peas
or
the
which
in
the
days
before
the
injury
used
to
make
the
birds
hasten
to
be
fed
quite
as
little
as
the
earlier
observers
have
i
seen
hemisphereless
answer
the
courting
of
the
male
a
hemisphereless
male
will
coo
all
day
long
and
show
distinct
signs
of
sexual
excitement
but
his
activity
is
without
any
object
it
is
entirely
indifferent
to
him
whether
the
be
there
or
not
if
one
is
placed
near
him
he
leaves
her
unnoticed
as
the
male
pays
no
attention
to
the
female
so
she
pays
none
to
her
young
the
brood
may
follow
the
mother
ceaselessly
calling
for
food

they
might
as
well
ask
it
from
a
stone
the
hemisphereless
pigeon
is
in
the
highest
degree
tame
and
fears
man
as
little
as
cat
or
bird
of
prey
notion
of
all
these
facts
lead
us
when
we
try
to
formulate
them
broadly
to
some
such
conception
as
this
lower
centres
act
from
present
sensational
stimuli
alone
the
hemispheres
act
from
the
sensations
which
they
may
receive
serving
only
as
suggesters
of
these
but
what
are
considerations
but
expectations
in
the
fancy
of
sensations
which
will
be
felt
one
way
or
another
according
as
action
takes
this
course
or
that
if
i
step
aside
on
seeing
a
rattlesnake
from
considering
how
dangerous
an
animal
he
is
the
mental
materials
which
constitute
my
prudential
reflection
are
images
more
or
less
vivid
of
the
movement
of
his
head
of
a
sudden
pain
in
my
leg
of
a
state
of
terror
a
swelling
of
the
limb
a
chill
delirium
death
and
the
ruin
of
my
hopes
but
all
these
images
are
constructed
out
of
my
past
experiences
they
are
of
what
i
have
felt
or
witnessed
they
are
in
short
sensations
and
the
main
difference
between
the
hemisphereless
animal
and
the
whole
one
may
be
concisely
expressed
by
saying
that
one
obeys
absent
the
other
only
present
hemispheres
would
then
seem
to
be
the
chief
seat
of
vestiges
of
past
experience
must
in
some
way
be
stored
up
in
them
and
must
when
aroused
by
present
stimuli
first
appear
as
representations
of
distant
goods
and
evils
and
then
must
discharge
into
the
appropriate
motor
channels
for
warding
off
the
evil
and
securing
the
benefits
of
the
good
if
we
liken
the
nervous
currents
to
electric
currents
we
can
compare
the
nervous
system
below
the
hemispheres
to
a
direct
circuit
from
to
muscle
along
the
line
c
of
fig
the
hemisphere
adds
the
long
circuit
or
through
which
the
current
may
pass
when
for
any
reason
the
direct
line
is
not
used

tired
wayfarer

himself

sensations
of
delicious
rest
and
coolness
pouring
themselves
through

direct

naturally
discharge

extension
he
would
abandon
himself
to
the
dangerous
repose
but
the
being
open
part
of
the
current
is
drafted
along
it
and
awakens
rheumatic
or
catarrhal
reminiscences
which
prevail
over
the
instigations
of
sense
and
make
the
man
arise
and
pursue
his
way
to
where
he
may
enjoy
his
rest
more
safely
presently
we
shall
examine
the
manner
in
which
the
hemispheric
may
be
supposed
to
serve
as
a
reservoir
for
such
reminiscences
as
these
meanwhile
i
will
ask
the
reader
to
notice
some
corollaries
of
its
being
such
a
reservoir

it

pause
postpone

weigh
one
motive
against
another
or
compare
prudence
in
a
word
is
for
such
a
creature
an
impossible
virtue
accordingly
we
see
that
nature
removes
those
functions
in
the
exercise
of
which
prudence
is
a
virtue
from
the
lower
centres
and
hands
them
over
to
the
cerebrum
wherever
a
creature
has
to
deal
with
complex
features
of

environment
prudence
is
a
virtue

have
so
to
deal

call

can
an
animal
perform

on

the

of
this

take
the

food
as
an
example
and
suppose
it
to
be
a
reflex
performance

lower
centres
the
animal
will
be
condemned
fatally
and
irresistibly
to
snap
at
it

presented

circumstances
may
be
he
can
no
more
disobey
this
prompting
than

the
attractiveness
of
the

not
their
extraordinary
fecundity

for
their
imprudence
appetite
and
the
acts
it
prompts
have
consequently
become
in
all
higher
vertebrates
functions
of
the
cerebrum
they
disappear
when
the
physiologist
knife
has
left
the
subordinate
centres
alone
in
place
the
brainless
pigeon
will
starve
though
left
on
a
take
again
the
sexual
function
in
birds
this
devolves
exclusively
upon
the
hemispheres
when
these
are
shorn
away
the
pigeon
pays
no
attention
to
the
billings
and
cooings
of
its
mate
it
is
the
same
according
to
goltz
with
male
dogs
who
have
suffered
large
losses
of
cerebral
tissue
those
who
have
read
darwin
descent
of
man
will
recollect
what
an
importance
this
author
ascribes
to
the
agency
of
sexual
selection
in
the
amelioration
of
the
breeds
of
birds
the
females
are
naturally
coy
and
their
coyness
must
be
overcome
by
the
exhibition
of
the
gorgeous
plumage
and
various
accomplishments
in
the
way
of
strutting
and
fighting
of
the
males
in
frogs
and
toads
on
the
other
hand
where
as
we
saw
on
page
the
sexual
instinct
devolves
upon
the
lower
centres
we
find
a
obedience
to
the
present
incitements
of
sense
and
an
almost
total
exclusion
of
the
power
of
choice
the
consequence
is
that
every
spring
an
immense
waste
of
batrachian
life
involving
numbers
of
adult
animals
and
innumerable
eggs
takes
place
from
no
other
cause
than
the
blind
character
of
the
sexual
impulse
in
these
creatures
no
one
need
be
told
how
dependent
all
human
social
elevation
is
upon
the
prevalence
of
chastity
hardly
any
factor
measures
more
than
this
the
difference
between
civilization
and
barbarism
physiologically
interpreted
chastity
means
nothing
more
than
the
fact
that
present
solicitations
of
sense
are
overpowered
by
suggestions
of
Ã¦sthetic
and
moral
fitness
which
the
circumstances
awaken
in
the
cerebrum
and
that
upon
the
inhibitory
or
permissive
influence
of
these
alone
action
directly
depends
within
the
psychic
life
due
to
the
cerebrum
itself
the
same
general
distinction
obtains
between
considerations
of
the
more
immediate
and
considerations
of
the
more
remote
in
all
ages
the
man
whose
determinations
are
swayed
by
reference
to
the
most
distant
ends
has
been
held
to
possess
the
highest
intelligence
the
tramp
who
lives
from
hour
to
hour
the
bohemian
whose
engagements
are
from
day
to
day
the
bachelor
who
builds
but
for
a
single
life
the
father
who
acts
for
another
generation
the
patriot
who
thinks
of
a
whole
community
and
many
generations
and
finally
the
philosopher
and
saint
whose
cares
are
for
humanity
and
for
eternity
these
range
themselves
in
an
unbroken
hierarchy
wherein
each
successive
grade
results
from
an
increased
manifestation
of
the
special
form
of
action
by
which
the
cerebral
centres
are
distinguished
from
all
below
them
in
the
along
which
the
memories
and
ideas
of
the
distant
are
supposed
to
lie
the
action
so
far
as
it
is
a
physical
process
must
be
interpreted
after
the
type
of
the
action
in
the
lower
centres
if
regarded
here
as
a
reflex
process
it
must
be
reflex
there
as
well
the
current
in
both
places
runs
out
into
the
muscles
only
after
it
has
first
run
in
but
whilst
the
path
by
which
it
runs
out
is
determined
in
the
lower
centres
by
reflections
few
and
fixed
amongst
the
in
the
hemispheres
the
reflections
are
many
and
instable
this
it
will
be
seen
is
only
a
difference
of
degree
and
not
of
kind
and
does
not
change
the
reflex
type
the
conception
of
action
as
conforming
to
this
type
is
the
fundamental
conception
of
modern
this
conception
now
has
led
to
two
quite
opposite
theories
about
the
relation
to
consciousness
of
the
nervous
functions
some
authors
finding
that
the
higher
voluntary
functions
seem
to
require
the
guidance
of
feeling
conclude
that
over
the
lowest
reflexes
some
such
feeling
also
presides
though
it
may
be
a
feeling
connected
with
the
spinal
cord
of
which
the
higher
conscious
self
connected
with
the
hemispheres
remains
unconscious
others
finding
that
reflex
and
acts
may
notwithstanding
their
appropriateness
take
place
with
an
unconsciousness
apparently
complete
fly
to
the
opposite
extreme
and
maintain
that
the
appropriateness
even
of
the
higher
voluntary
actions
connected
with
the
hemispheres
owes
nothing
to
the
fact
that
consciousness
attends
them
they
are
according
to
these
writers
results
of
physiological
mechanism
pure
and
simple
to
comprehend
completely
this
latter
doctrine
one
should
apply
it
to
examples
the
movements
of
our
tongues
and
pens
the
flashings
of
our
eyes
in
conversation
are
of
course
events
of
a
physiological
order
and
as
such
their
causal
antecedents
may
be
exclusively
mechanical
if
we
knew
thoroughly
the
nervous
system
of
shakespeare
and
as
thoroughly
all
his
environing
conditions
we
should
be
able
according
to
the
theory
of
automatism
to
show
why
at
a
given
period
of
his
life
his
hand
came
to
trace
on
certain
sheets
of
paper
those
crabbed
little
black
marks
which
we
for
shortness
sake
call
the
manuscript
of
hamlet
we
should
understand
the
rationale
of
every
erasure
and
alteration
therein
and
we
should
understand
all
this
without
in
the
slightest
degree
acknowledging
the
existence
of
the
thoughts
in
shakespeare
mind
the
words
and
sentences
would
be
taken
not
as
signs
of
anything
beyond
themselves
but
as
little
outward
facts
pure
and
simple
in
like
manner
the
affirms
we
might
exhaustively
write
the
biography
of
those
two
hundred
pounds
more
or
less
of
warmish
albuminoid
matter
called
martin
luther
without
ever
implying
that
it
felt
but
on
the
other
hand
nothing
in
all
this
could
prevent
us
from
giving
an
equally
complete
account
of
either
luther
or
spiritual
history
an
account
in
which
every
gleam
of
thought
and
emotion
should
find
its
place
the
would
run
alongside
of
the
of
each
man
and
each
point
in
the
one
would
correspond
to
but
not
react
upon
a
point
in
the
other
so
the
melody
floats
from
the
but
neither
checks
nor
quickens
its
vibrations
so
the
shadow
runs
alongside
the
pedestrian
but
in
no
way
influences
his
steps
as
a
mere
and
so
long
as
we
confine
our
view
to
the
nervous
centres
themselves
few
things
are
more
seductive
than
this
radically
mechanical
theory
of
their
action
and
yet
our
consciousness
and
has
in
all
probability
been
evolved
like
all
other
functions
for
a
use
it
is
to
the
highest
degree
improbable
that
it
should
have
no
use
its
use
to
be
that
of
but
to
select
it
must
be
efficacious
states
of
consciousness
which
feel
right
are
held
fast
to
those
which
feel
wrong
are
checked
if
the
and
the
of
the
conscious
states
severally
mean
also
the
efficacious
reinforcing
or
inhibiting
of
the
correlated
neural
processes
then
it
would
seem
as
if
the
presence
of
the
states
of
mind
might
help
to
steer
the
nervous
system
and
keep
it
in
the
path
which
to
the
consciousness
seemed
best
now
on
the
average
what
seems
best
to
consciousness
is
really
best
for
the
creature
it
is
a
fact
that
pleasures
are
generally
associated
with
beneficial
pains
with
detrimental
experiences
all
the
fundamental
vital
processes
illustrate
this
law
starvation
suffocation
privation
of
food
drink
and
sleep
work
when
exhausted
burns
wounds
inflammation
the
effects
of
poison
are
as
disagreeable
as
filling
the
hungry
stomach
enjoying
rest
and
sleep
after
fatigue
exercise
after
rest
and
a
sound
skin
and
unbroken
bones
at
all
times
are
pleasant
spencer
and
others
have
suggested
that
these
coincidences
are
due
not
to
any
preÃ«stablished
harmony
but
to
the
mere
action
of
natural
selection
which
would
certainly
kill
off
in
the
any
breed
of
creatures
to
whom
the
fundamentally
noxious
experience
seemed
enjoyable
an
animal
that
should
take
pleasure
in
a
feeling
of
suffocation
would
if
that
pleasure
were
efficacious
enough
to
make
him
keep
his
head
under
water
enjoy
a
longevity
of
four
or
five
minutes
but
if
conscious
pleasure
does
not
reinforce
and
conscious
pain
does
not
inhibit
anything
one
does
not
see
without
some
such
rational
harmony
as
would
be
scouted
by
the
champions
of
the
why
the
most
noxious
acts
such
as
burning
might
not
with
perfect
impunity
give
thrills
of
delight
and
the
most
necessary
ones
such
as
breathing
cause
agony
the
only
considerable
attempt
that
has
been
made
to
explain
the
of
our
feelings
is
that
of
grant
allen
in
his
suggestive
little
work
and
his
reasoning
is
based
exclusively
on
that
causal
efficacy
of
pleasures
and
pains
which
the
partisans
of
pure
automatism
so
strenuously
deny
probability
and
circumstantial
evidence
thus
run
dead
against
the
theory
that
our
actions
are
mechanical
in
their
causation
from
the
point
of
view
of
descriptive
psychology
even
though
we
be
bound
to
assume
as
on
that
all
our
feelings
have
for
their
condition
of
existence
and
can
be
remotely
traced
in
every
instance
to
currents
coming
from
the
outer
world
we
have
no
clear
reason
to
doubt
that
the
feelings
may
react
so
as
to
further
or
to
dampen
the
processes
to
which
they
are
due
i
shall
therefore
not
hesitate
in
the
course
of
this
book
to
use
the
language
of
i
shall
talk
as
if
consciousness
kept
actively
pressing
the
in
the
direction
of
its
own
ends
and
was
no
mere
impotent
and
paralytic
spectator
of
life
game
localization
of
functions
in
the
the
hemispheres
we
lately
said
must
be
the
organ
of
memory
and
in
some
way
retain
vestiges
of
former
currents
by
means
of
which
mental
considerations
drawn
from
the
past
may
be
aroused
before
action
takes
place
the
vivisections
of
physiologists
and
the
observations
of
physicians
have
of
late
years
given
a
concrete
confirmation
to
this
notion
which
the
first
rough
appearances
suggest
the
various
convolutions
have
had
special
functions
assigned
to
them
in
relation
to
this
and
that
as
well
as
to
this
or
that
portion
of
the
muscular
system
this
book
is
no
place
for
going
over
the
evidence
in
detail
so
i
will
simply
indicate
the
conclusions
which
are
most
probable
at
the
date
of
writing
and
cerebral
in
the
first
place
there
is
a
very
neat
parallelism
between
the
analysis
of
by
the
physiologists
and
that
of
mental
functions
by
the
psychologists
the
phrenological
divided
the
brain
into
each
of
which
stood
for
the
man
in
a
certain
partial
attitude
the
organ
of
with
its
concomitant
consciousness
is
an
entire
man
so
far
as
he
loves
children
that
of
is
an
entire
man
worshipping
etc
the
spiritualistic
psychology
in
turn
divided
the
mind
into
which
were
also
entire
mental
men
in
certain
limited
attitudes
but
are
not
mental
any
more
than
are
analysis
breaks
both
into
more
elementary
constituents
brain
and
mind
alike
consist
of
simple
elements
sensory
and
motor
all
nervous
centres
says
hughlings
jackson
from
the
lowest
to
the
very
highest
the
substrata
of
consciousness
are
made
up
of
nothing
else
than
nervous
arrangements
representing
impressions
and
movements
i
do
not
see
of
what
other
materials
the
brain
be
made
meynert
represents
the
matter
similarly
when
he
calls
the
cortex
of
the
hemispheres
the
surface
of
projection
for
every
muscle
and
every
sensitive
point
of
the
body
the
muscles
and
the
sensitive
points
are
each
by
a
cortical
point
and
the
brain
is
little
more
than
the
sum
of
all
these
cortical
points
to
which
on
the
mental
side
as
many
sensations
and
correspond
the
sensations
and
ideas
of
sensation
and
of
motion
are
in
turn
the
elements
out
of
which
the
mind
is
built
according
to
the
analytic
school
of
psychology
the
relations
between
objects
are
explained
by
between
the
ideas
and
the
emotional
and
instinctive
tendencies
by
associations
between
ideas
and
movements

and

or

the
associationist
doctrine
of
may
be
doubted
to
be
a
literal
expression
of
the
truth
but
it
probably
will
always
retain
a
didactic
usefulness
at
all
events
it
is
interesting
to
see
how
well
physiological
analysis
plays
into
its
hands
to
proceed
to
details

at

this
would
happen
wherever
organs
on
sides
of
the
body
could
be
governed
by
the
left
hemisphere
and
just
such
a
case
seems
offered
by
the
vocal
organs
in
that
highly
delicate

special
motor
service
which
we
call
speech

either

able
to
innervate

the
special

of

however
it
would
appear
from
these
very
facts
of
aphasia

this
also
is
proved
by
all
the
three
kinds
of
possible
evidence
it
seems
that
the
fibres
from
the
halves
of
retinÃ¦
go
to
the
hemisphere
those
from
the
right
half
to
the
right
hemisphere
the
consequence
is
that
when
the
right
occipital
lobe
for
example
is
injured
results
in
both
eyes
that
is
both
retinÃ¦
grow
blind
as
to
their
right
halves
and
the
patient
loses
the
leftward
half
of
his
field

the

quite
recently
both
schaefer

munk
in
studying
the
movements
of
the

by
galvanizing
the
visual
cortex
in
monkeys

have
found
reason
to
plot
out
an
analogous
correspondence
between
the
upper
and
lower
portions
of
the
retinÃ¦
and
certain
parts
of
the
visual
cortex
if
both
occipital

we
should
have
double
hemiopia

in
other
words
total

to

in

the

we
ought
to
expect
that
the

of

we

this

just
what

do

complication

in

this
we
studied
motor
aphasia
a
few
pages
back
we
must
now
consider
our
knowledge
of
aphasia
has
had
three
stages
we
may
talk
of
the
period
of
broca
the
period
of
wernicke
and
the
period
of
charcot
what
broca
discovery
was
we
have
seen
wernicke
was
the
first
to
discriminate
those
cases
in
which
the
patient
can
even
speech
from
those
in
which
he
can
understand
only
not
talk
and
to
ascribe
the
former
condition
to
lesion
of
the
temporal
lobe
the
condition
in
question
is
and
the
disease
is
the
latest
statistical
survey
of
the
subject
is
that
by
allen
starr
in
the
seven
cases
of
which
he
has
collected
cases
in
which
the
patient
could
read
talk
and
write
but
not
understand
what
was
said
to
him
the
lesion
was
limited
to
the
first
and
second
temporal
convolutions
in
their
posterior
two
thirds
the
lesion
in
persons
is
always
on
the
left
side
like
the
lesion
in
motor
aphasia
crude
hearing
would
not
be
abolished
even
were
the
left
centre
for
it
utterly
destroyed
the
right
centre
would
still
provide
for
that
but
the
of
hearing
appears
bound
up
with
the
integrity
of
the
left
centre
more
or
less
exclusively
here
it
must
be
that
words
heard
enter
into
association
with
the
things
which
they
represent
on
the
one
hand
and
with
the
movements
necessary
for
pronouncing
them
on
the
other
in
most
of
us
as
wernicke
said
speech
must
go
on
from
auditory
cues
that
is
our
visual
tactile
and
other
ideas
probably
do
not
innervate
our
motor
centres
directly
but
only
after
first
arousing
the
mental
sound
of
the
words
this
is
the
immediate
stimulus
to
articulation
and
where
the
possibility
of
this
is
abolished
by
the
destruction
of
its
usual
channel
in
the
left
temporal
lobe
the
articulation
must
suffer
in
the
few
cases
in
which
the
channel
is
abolished
with
no
bad
effect
on
speech
we
must
suppose
an
idiosyncrasy
the
patient
must
innervate
his
either
from
the
corresponding
portion
of
the
other
hemisphere
or
directly
from
the
centres
of
vision
touch
without
leaning
on
the
auditory
region
it
is
the
minuter
analysis
of
such
individual
differences
as
these
which
constitutes
charcot
contribution
towards
clearing
up
the
subject
every
namable
thing
has
numerous
properties
qualities
or
aspects
in
our
minds
the
properties
together
with
the
name
form
an
associated
group
if
different
parts
of
the
brain
are
severally
concerned
with
the
several
properties
and
a
farther
part
with
the
hearing
and
still
another
with
the
uttering
of
the
name
there
must
inevitably
be
brought
about
through
the
law
of
association
which
we
shall
later
study
such
a
connection
amongst
all
these
that
the
activity
of
any
one
of
them
will
be
likely
to
awaken
the
activity
of
all
the
rest
when
we
are
talking
whilst
we
think
the
process
is
utterance
if
the
for
be
injured
speech
is
impossible
or
disorderly
even
though
all
the
other
be
intact
and
this
is
just
the
condition
of
things
which
on
we
found
to
be
brought
about
by
lesion
of
the
convolution
of
broca
but
back
of
that
last
act
various
orders
of
succession
are
possible
in
the
associations
of
a
talking
ideas
the
more
usual
order
is
as
aforesaid
from
the
tactile
visual
or
other
properties
of
the
things
to
the
sound
of
their
names
and
then
to
the
latter
utterance
but
if
in
a
certain
individual
mind
the
of
an
object
or
the
of
its
name
be
what
habitually
precedes
articulation
then
the
loss
of
the
centre
will
not
affect
that
individual
speech
or
reading
he
will
be
mentally
deaf
his
of
the
human
voice
will
suffer
but
he
will
not
be
aphasic
in
this
way
it
is
possible
to
explain
the
seven
cases
of
without
motor
aphasia
which
figure
in
starr
table
if
this
order
of
association
be
ingrained
and
habitual
in
that
individual
injury
to
his
centres
will
make
him
not
only
but
aphasic
as
well
his
speech
will
become
confused
in
consequence
of
an
occipital
lesion
naunyn
consequently
plotting
out
on
a
diagram
of
the
hemisphere
the
irreproachably
reported
cases
of
aphasia
which
he
was
able
to
collect
finds
that
the
lesions
concentrate
themselves
in
three
places
first
on
broca
centre
second
on
wernicke
third
on
the
and
angular
convolutions
under
which
those
fibres
pass
which
connect
the
visual
centres
with
the
rest
of
the
brain

this
result

of
purely
sensory
cases
agrees
in
the
chapter
on
imagination
we
shall
return
to
these
differences
in
the
sensory
spheres
of
different
individuals
meanwhile
few
things
show
more
beautifully
than
the
history
of
our
knowledge
of
aphasia
how
the
sagacity
and
patience
of
many
banded
workers
are
in
time
certain
to
analyze
the
darkest
confusion
into
an
orderly
display
there
is
no
of
speech
in
the
brain
any
more
than
there
is
a
of
speech
in
the
mind
the
entire
mind
and
the
entire
brain
are
more
or
less
at
work
in
a
man
who
uses
language
the
subjoined
diagram
from
ross
shows
the
four
parts
most
vitally
concerned
and
in
the
light
of
our
text
needs
no
farther
explanation
see

and
the
other
sensory
centres
are
less
definitely
made
out
of
smell

taste

will
say
nothing
and
of
muscular
and
cutaneous
feeling
only
this
that
it
seems
most
probably
seated
in
the
motor
zone
and
possibly
in
the
convolutions
immediately
backwards
and
midwards
thereof
the
incoming
tactile
currents
must
enter
the
cells
of
this
region
by
one
set
of
fibres
and
the
discharges
leave
them
by
another

jackson
with
which
we
started
on
to
be
on
the
whole
most
satisfactorily
corroborated
by
objective
research
highest
centres
do
probably
contain
nothing
but
arrangements
for
representing
impressions
and
movements
and
other
arrangements
for
coupling
the
activity
of
these
arrangements
currents
pouring
in
from
the
first
excite
some
arrangements
which
in
turn
excite
others
until
at
last
a
discharge
downwards
of
some
sort
occurs
when
this
is
once
clearly
grasped
there
remains
little
ground
for
asking
whether
the
motor
zone
is
exclusively
motor
or
sensitive
as
well
the
whole
cortex
inasmuch
as
currents
run
through
it
is
both
all
the
currents
probably
have
feelings
going
with
them
and
sooner
or
later
bring
movements
about
in
one
aspect
then
every
centre
is
afferent
in
another
efferent
even
the
motor
cells
of
the
spinal
cord
having
these
two
aspects
inseparably
conjoined
marique
and
exner
and
paneth
have
shown
that
by
cutting
a
centre
and
so
separating
it
from
the
influence
of
the
rest
of
the
cortex
the
same
disorders
are
produced
as
by
cutting
it
out
so
that
it
is
really
just
what
i
called
it
only
the
funnel
through
which
the
stream
of
innervation
starting
from
elsewhere
escapes
accompanying
the
stream
and
being
mainly
of
things
seen
if
the
stream
is
strongest
occipitally
of
things
heard
if
it
is
strongest
temporally
of
things
felt
if
the
stream
occupies
most
intensely
the
zone
it
seems
to
me
that
some
broad
and
vague
formulation
like
this
is
as
much
as
we
can
safely
venture
on
in
the
present
state
of
science
so
much
at
least
is
not
likely
to
be
overturned
but
it
is
obvious
how
little
this
tells
us
of
the
detail
of
what
goes
on
in
the
brain
when
a
certain
thought
is
before
the
mind
the
general
forms
of
relation
perceived
between
things
as
their
identities
likenesses
or
contrasts
the
forms
of
the
consciousness
itself
as
effortless
or
perplexed
attentive
or
inattentive
pleasant
or
disagreeable
the
phenomena
of
interest
and
selection
are
all
lumped
together
as
effects
correlated
with
the
currents
that
connect
one
centre
with
another
nothing
can
be
more
vague
than
such
a
formula
moreover
certain
portions
of
the
brain
as
the
lower
frontal
lobes
escape
formulational
together
their
destruction
gives
rise
to
no
local
trouble
of
either
motion
or
sensibility
in
dogs
and
in
monkeys
neither
stimulation
nor
excision
of
these
lobes
produces
any
symptoms
whatever
one
monkey
of
horsley
and
schaefer
was
as
tame
and
did
certain
tricks
as
well
after
as
before
the
operation
it
is
in
short
obvious
that
our
knowledge
of
our
mental
states
infinitely
exceeds
our
knowledge
of
their
concomitant
cerebral
conditions
without
introspective
analysis
of
the
mental
elements
of

the
doctrine
of

most
brilliant
jewel
in

have
been
utterly
impossible
our

therefore
that

still
be
understood
as
a
mere

may
have
a

speak
of

coÃ¶perate

chapter
ix
some
general
conditions
of
neural
activity
nervous
the
word
discharge
is
constantly
used
and
must
be
used
in
this
book
to
designate
the
escape
of
a
current
downwards
into
muscles
or
other
internal
organs
the
reader
must
not
understand
the
word
figuratively
from
the
point
of
view
of
dynamics
the
passage
of
a
current
out
of
a
motor
cell
is
probably
altogether
analogous
to
the
explosion
of
a
gun
the
matter
of
the
cell
is
in
a
state
of
internal
tension
which
the
incoming
current
resolves
tumbling
the
molecules
into
a
more
stable
equilibrium
and
liberating
an
amount
of
energy
which
starts
the
current
of
the
outgoing
fibre
this
current
is
stronger
than
that
of
the
incoming
fibre
when
it
reaches
the
muscle
it
produces
an
analogous
disintegration
of
molecules
and
the
result
is
a
stronger
effect
still
matteuci
found
that
the
work
done
by
a
contraction
was
times
greater
than
that
done
by
the
galvanic
current
which
stimulated
its
motor
nerve
when
a
frog
is
made
to
contract
first
directly
by
stimulation
of
its
motor
nerve
and
second
reflexly
by
stimulation
of
a
sensory
nerve
it
is
found
that
the
reflex
way
requires
a
stronger
current
and
is
more
tardy
but
that
the
contraction
is
stronger
when
it
does
occur
these
facts
prove
that
the
cells
in
the
spinal
cord
through
which
the
reflex
takes
place
offer
a
resistance
which
has
first
to
be
overcome
but
that
a
relatively
violent
outward
current
outwards
then
escapes
from
them
what
is
this
but
an
explosive
discharge
on
a
minute
scale
the
measurement
of
the
time
required
for
the
discharge
is
one
of
the
lines
of
experimental
investigation
most
diligently
followed
of
late
years
helmholtz
led
the
way
by
discovering
the
rapidity
of
the
outgoing
current
in
the
sciatic
nerve
of
the
frog
the
methods
he
used
were
soon
applied
to
sensory
reactions
and
the
results
caused
much
popular
admiration
when
described
as
measurements
of
the
of
thought
the
phrase
as
thought
had
from
time
immemorial
signified
all
that
was
wonderful
and
elusive
of
determination
in
the
line
of
speed
and
the
way
in
which
science
laid
her
doomful
hand
upon
this
mystery
reminded
people
of
the
day
when
franklin
first
cÅlo
foreshadowing
the
reign
of
a
newer
and
colder
race
of
gods
i
may
say
however
immediately
that
the
phrase
of
is
misleading
for
it
is
by
no
means
clear
in
any
of
the
cases
what
particular
act
of
thought
occurs
during
the
time
which
is
measured
what
the
times
in
question
really
represent
is
the
total
duration
of
certain
upon
certain
of
the
conditions
of
the
reaction
are
prepared
beforehand
they
consist
in
the
assumption
of
those
motor
and
sensory
tensions
which
we
name
the
expectant
state
just
what
happens
during
the
actual
time
occupied
by
the
reaction
in
other
words
just
what
is
added
to
the
preÃ«xistent
tensions
to
produce
the
actual
discharge
is
not
made
out
at
present
either
from
the
neural
or
from
the
mental
point
of
view
the
method
is
essentially
the
same
in
all
these
investigations
a
signal
of
some
sort
is
communicated
to
the
subject
and
at
the
same
instant
records
itself
on
a
apparatus
the
subject
then
makes
a
muscular
movement
of
some
sort
which
is
the
and
which
also
records
itself
automatically
the
time
found
to
have
elapsed
between
the
two
records
is
the
total
time
of
that
reaction
the
instruments
are
of
various
types
one
type
is
that
of
the
revolving
drum
covered
with
smoked
paper
on
which
one
electric
pen
traces
a
line
which
the
signal
breaks
and
the
draws
again
whilst
another
electric
pen
connected
with
a
rod
of
metal
vibrating
at
a
known
rate
traces
alongside
of
the
former
line
a
of
which
each
undulation
or
link
stands
for
a
certain
fraction
of
a
second
and
against
which
the
break
in
the
can
be
measured
compare
fig
where
the
line
is
broken
by
the
signal
at
the
first
arrow
and
continued
again
by
the
reaction
at
the
second
the
machine
most
often
used
is
hipp
chronoscopic
clock
the
hands
are
placed
at
zero
the
signal
starts
them
by
an
electric
connection
and
the
reaction
stops
them
the
duration
of
their
movement
down
to
of
a
second
is
then
read
off
from
the
illustration
fig
it
is
found
that
the
differs
in
the
same
person
according
to
the
direction
of
his
expectant
attention
if
he
thinks
as
little
as
possible
of
the
movement
which
he
is
to
make
and
concentrates
his
mind
upon
the
signal
to
be
received
it
is
longer
if
on
the
contrary
he
bends
his
mind
exclusively
upon
the
muscular
response
it
is
shorter
lange
who
first
noticed
this
fact
when
working
in
wundt
laboratory
found
his
own
to
average
whilst
his
averaged
as
much
as
it
is
obvious
that
experiments
to
have
any
value
must
always
be
made
according
to
the
method
which
reduces
the
figure
to
its
minimum
and
makes
it
more
constant
in
general
it
lies
between
one
and
two
tenths
of
a
second
it
seems
to
me
that
under
these
circumstances
the
reaction
is
essentially
a
reflex
act
the
preliminary
of
the
muscles
for
the
movement
means
the
excitement
of
the
paths
of
discharge
to
a
point
just
short
of
actual
discharge
before
the
signal
comes
in
in
other
words
it
means
the
temporary
formation
of
a
real
in
the
centres
through
which
the
incoming
current
instantly
can
pour
out
again
but
when
on
the
other
hand
the
expectant
attention
is
exclusively
addressed
to
the
signal
the
excitement
of
the
motor
tracts
can
only
begin
after
this
latter
has
come
in
and
under
this
condition
the
reaction
takes
more
time
in
the
condition
in
which
we
stand
when
making
reactions
by
the
method
we
sometimes
respond
to
a
wrong
signal
especially
if
it
be
of
the
same
with
the
one
we
expect
the
signal
is
but
the
spark
which
touches
off
a
train
already
laid
there
is
no
thought
in
the
matter
the
hand
jerks
by
an
involuntary
start
these
experiments
are
thus
in
no
sense
measurements
of
the
swiftness
of
only
when
we
complicate
them
is
there
a
chance
for
anything
like
an
intellectual
operation
to
occur
they
may
be
complicated
in
various
ways
the
reaction
may
be
withheld
until
the
signal
has
consciously
awakened
a
distinct
idea
wundt
and
may
then
be
performed
or
there
may
be
a
variety
of
possible
signals
each
with
a
different
reaction
assigned
to
it
and
the
reacter
may
be
uncertain
which
one
he
is
about
to
receive
the
reaction
would
then
hardly
seem
to
occur
without
a
preliminary
recognition
and
choice
even
here
however
the
discrimination
and
choice
are
widely
different
from
the
intellectual
operations
of
which
we
are
ordinarily
conscious
under
those
names
meanwhile
the
simple
remains
as
the
starting
point
of
all
these
superinduced
complications
and
its
own
variations
must
be
briefly
passed
in
review
the
varies

his
old
and
uncultivated
people

it
to
a
quantity
which
is
for
each
individual
a
minimum
beyond
which
no
farther
reduction
can
be
made
the
aforesaid
old
pauper

was
after
much
practice
reduced
to

and
of

the
time
herzen
compared
the
reaction
from
a
on
the
toe
with
that
from
the
skin
of
the
hand
of
the
same
subject
the
two
places
were
stimulated
simultaneously
and
the
subject
tried
to
react
simultaneously
with
both
hand
and
foot
but
the
foot
always
went
quickest
when
the
sound
skin
of
the
foot
was
touched
instead
of
the
corn
it
was
the
hand
which
always
reacted
first
on
the
whole
lengthen
the
time
but
much
depends
on
the
dose
these
occur
when
some
kind
of
intellectual
operation
accompanies
the
reaction
the
rational
place
in
which
to
report
of
them
would
be
under
the
head
of
the
various
intellectual
operations
concerned
but
certain
persons
prefer
to
see
all
these
measurements
bunched
together
regardless
of
context
so
to
meet
their
views
i
give
the
complicated
reactions
here
when
we
have
to
think
before
reacting
it
is
obvious
that
there
is
no
definite
of
which
we
can
talk
it
all
depends
on
how
long
we
think
the
only
times
we
can
measure
are
the
times
of
certain
determinate
and
very
simple
intellectual
operations
the
required
for
has
thus
been
made
a
subject
of
experimental
measurement
wundt
calls
it
his
subjects
whose
simple
had
previously
been
determined
were
required
to
make
a
movement
always
the
same
the
instant
they
discerned
of
two
or
more
signals
they
received
the
of
time
occupied
by
these
reactions
the
simple
in
which
only
one
signal
was
used
and
known
in
advance
measured
according
to
wundt
the
time
required
for
the
act
of
discrimination
it
was
found
longer
when
four
different
signals
were
irregularly
used
than
when
only
two
were
used
when
two
were
used
the
signals
being
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
black
or
of
a
white
object
the
average
times
of
three
observers
were
respectively
in
seconds
when
four
signals
were
used
a
red
and
a
green
light
being
added
to
the
others
it
became
for
the
same
observers
cattell
found
he
could
get
no
results
by
this
method
and
reverted
to
one
used
by
observers
previous
to
wundt
and
which
wundt
had
rejected
this
is
the
as
wundt
calls
it
the
reacter
awaits
the
signal
and
reacts
if
it
is
of
one
sort
but
omits
to
act
if
it
is
of
another
sort
the
reaction
thus
occurs
after
discrimination
the
motor
impulse
can
not
be
sent
to
the
hand
until
the
subject
knows
what
the
signal
is
reacting
in
this
way
cattell
found
the
increment
of
time
required
for
distinguishing
a
white
signal
from
no
signal
to
be
in
two
observers
and
that
for
distinguishing
one
color
from
another
was
similarly
and
that
for
distinguishing
a
certain
color
from
ten
other
colors
and
that
for
distinguishing
the
letter
a
in
ordinary
print
from
the
letter
z
and
that
for
distinguishing
a
given
letter
from
all
the
rest
of
the
alphabet
not
reacting
until
that
letter
appeared
and
that
for
distinguishing
a
word
from
any
of
other
words
from
to
sec
the
difference
depending
on
the
length
of
the
words
and
the
familiarity
of
the
language
to
which
they
belonged
cattell
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
time
for
distinguishing
a
word
is
often
but
little
more
than
that
for
distinguishing
a
letter
we
do
not
therefore
he
says
distinguish
separately
the
letters
of
which
a
word
is
composed
but
the
word
as
a
whole
the
application
of
this
in
teaching
children
to
read
is
evident
he
also
finds
a
great
difference
in
the
time
with
which
various
letters
are
distinguished
e
being
particularly
bad
time
required
for
of
one
idea
with
another
has
been
measured
gallon
using
a
very
simple
apparatus
found
that
the
sight
of
an
unforeseen
word
would
awaken
an
associated
in
about
of
a
second
wundt
next
made
determinations
in
which
the
was
given
by
words
called
out
by
an
assistant
the
person
experimented
on
had
to
press
a
key
as
soon
as
the
sound
of
the
word
awakened
an
associated
idea
both
word
and
reaction
were
chronographically
registered
and
the
total
between
the
two
amounted
in
four
observers
to
and
seconds
respectively
from
this
the
simple
and
the
time
of
merely
identifying
the
word
sound
the
as
wundt
calls
it
must
be
subtracted
to
get
the
exact
time
required
for
the
associated
idea
to
arise
these
times
were
separately
determined
and
subtracted
the
difference
called
by
wundt
amounted
in
the
same
four
persons
to
and
thousandths
of
a
second
respectively
the
length
of
the
last
figure
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
person
reacting
was
an
american
whose
associations
with
german
words
would
naturally
be
slower
than
those
of
natives
the
shortest
noted
was
when
the
word
suggested
to
wundt
the
word
in
second
cattell
made
some
interesting
observations
upon
the
between
the
look
of
letters
and
their
names
i
pasted
letters
he
says
on
a
revolving
drum
and
determined
at
what
rate
they
could
be
read
aloud
as
they
passed
by
a
slit
in
a
screen
he
found
it
to
vary
according
as
one
or
more
than
one
letter
was
visible
at
a
time
through
the
slit
and
gives
half
a
second
as
about
the
time
which
it
takes
to
see
and
name
a
single
letter
seen
alone
the
rapidity
of
a
man
is
of
course
a
measure
of
that
of
his
associations
since
each
seen
word
must
call
up
its
name
at
least
ere
it
is
read
i
find
says
cattell
that
it
takes
about
twice
as
long
to
read
aloud
as
fast
as
possible
words
which
have
no
connection
as
words
which
make
sentences
and
letters
which
have
no
connection
as
letters
which
make
words
when
the
words
make
sentences
and
the
letters
words
not
only
do
the
processes
of
seeing
and
naming
overlap
but
by
one
mental
effort
the
subject
can
recognize
a
whole
group
of
words
or
letters
and
by
one
choose
the
motions
to
be
made
in
naming
so
that
the
rate
at
which
the
words
and
letters
are
read
is
really
only
limited
by
the
maximum
rapidity
at
which
the
can
be
moved
for
example
when
reading
as
fast
as
possible
the
writer
rate
was
english
french
german
italian
latin
and
greek
the
figures
giving
the
thousandths
of
a
second
taken
to
read
each
word
experiments
made
on
others
strikingly
confirm
these
results
the
subject
does
not
know
that
he
is
reading
the
foreign
language
more
slowly
than
his
own
this
explains
why
foreigners
seem
to
talk
so
fast
the
time
required
to
see
and
name
colors
and
pictures
of
objects
was
determined
in
the
same
way
the
time
was
found
to
be
about
the
same
over
sec
for
colors
as
for
pictures
and
about
twice
as
long
as
for
words
and
letters
other
experiments
i
have
made
show
that
we
can
recognize
a
single
color
or
picture
in
a
slightly
shorter
time
than
a
word
or
letter
but
take
longer
to
name
it
this
is
because
in
the
case
of
words
and
letters
the
association
between
the
idea
and
the
name
has
taken
place
so
often
that
the
process
has
become
automatic
whereas
in
the
case
of
colors
and
pictures
we
must
by
a
voluntary
effort
choose
the
name
romanes
has
found
astonishing
differences
in
the
rate
of
reading
which
is
possible
to
different
individuals
all
of
whom
have
been
accustomed
to
extensive
reading
that
is
to
say
the
difference
may
amount
to
to
or
otherwise
stated
in
a
given
time
one
individual
may
be
able
to
read
four
times
as
much
as
another
moreover
it
appeared
that
there
was
no
relationship
between
slowness
of
reading
and
power
of
assimilation
on
the
contrary
when
all
the
efforts
are
directed
to
assimilating
as
much
as
possible
in
a
given
time
the
rapid
readers
as
shown
by
their
written
notes
usually
give
a
better
account
of
the
portions
of
the

further

lay

a

at

at

of

in

but
the
best
proof
of
the
immediate
afflux
of
blood
to
the
brain
during
mental
activity
is
due
to
mosso
observations
on
three
persons
whose
brain
had
been
laid
bare
by
lesion
of
the
skull
by
means
of
apparatus
described
in
his
book
this
physiologist
was
enabled
to
let
the
record
itself
directly
by
a
tracing
the
rose
immediately
whenever
the
subject
was
spoken
to
or
when
he
began
to
think
actively
as
in
solving
a
problem
in
mental
arithmetic
mosso
gives
in
his
work
a
large
number
of
reproductions
of
tracings
which
show
the
instantaneity
of
the
change
of
whenever
the
mental
activity
was
quickened
by
any
cause
whatever
intellectual
or
emotional
he
relates
of
his
female
subject
that
one
day
whilst
tracing
her
he
observed
a
sudden
rise
with
no
apparent
outer
or
inner
cause
she
however
confessed
to
him
afterwards
that
at
that
moment
she
had
caught
sight
of
a
on
top
of
a
piece
of
furniture
in
the
room
and
that
this
had
given
her
a
slight
emotion
seems
accompanied
by
a
local
disengagement
of
the
earliest
careful
work
in
this
direction
was
by
lombard
in
he
noted
the
changes
in
delicate
thermometers
and
electric
piles
placed
against
the
scalp
in
human
beings
and
found
that
any
intellectual
effort
such
as
computing
composing
reciting
poetry
silently
or
aloud
and
especially
that
emotional
excitement
such
as
an
angry
fit
caused
a
general
rise
of
temperature
which
rarely
exceeded
a
degree
fahrenheit
in
the
indefatigable
schiff
took
up
the
subject
experimenting
on
live
dogs
and
chickens
by
plunging
needles
into
the
substance
of
their
brain
after
habituation
was
established
he
tested
the
animals
with
various
sensations
tactile
optic
olfactory
and
auditory
he
found
very
regularly
an
abrupt
alteration
of
the
temperature
when
for
instance
he
presented
an
empty
roll
of
paper
to
the
nose
of
his
dog
as
it
lay
motionless
there
was
a
small
deflection
but
when
a
piece
of
meat
was
in
the
paper
the
deflection
was
much
greater
schiff
concluded
from
these
and
other
experiments
that
sensorial
activity
heats
the
but
he
did
not
try
to
localize
the
increment
of
heat
beyond
finding
that
it
was
in
both
hemispheres
whatever
might
be
the
sensation
applied
amidon
in
made
a
farther
step
forward
in
localizing
the
heat
produced
by
voluntary
muscular
contractions
applying
a
number
of
delicate
simultaneously
against
the
scalp
he
found
that
when
different
muscles
of
the
body
were
made
to
contract
vigorously
for
ten
minutes
or
more
different
regions
of
the
scalp
rose
in
temperature
that
the
regions
were
well
focalized
and
that
the
rise
of
temperature
was
often
considerably
over
a
fahrenheit
degree
to
a
large
extent
these
regions
correspond
to
the
centres
for
the
same
movements
assigned
by
ferrier
and
others
on
other
grounds
only
they
cover
more
of
the
skull
and
considering
the
large
amount
of
popular
nonsense
which
passes
current
on
this
subject
i
may
be
pardoned
for
a
brief
mention
of
it
here
phosphor
kein
was
a
noted
of
the
during
the
excitement
on
that
subject
which
filled
germany
in
the
the
brain
like
every
other
organ
of
the
body
contains
phosphorus
and
a
score
of
other
chemicals
besides
why
the
phosphorus
should
be
picked
out
as
its
essence
no
one
knows
it
would
be
equally
true
to
say
wasser
kein
gedanke
or
kochsalz
kein
gedanke
for
thought
would
stop
as
quickly
if
the
brain
should
dry
up
or
lose
its
nacl
as
if
it
lost
its
phosphorus
in
america
the
has
twined
itself
round
a
saying
quoted
rightly
or
wrongly
from
professor
agassiz
to
the
effect
that
fishermen
are
more
intelligent
than
farmers
because
they
eat
so
much
fish
which
contains
so
much
phosphorus
all
the
alleged
facts
may
be
doubted
the
only
straight
way
to
ascertain
the
importance
of
phosphorus
to
thought
would
be
to
find
whether
more
is
excreted
by
the
brain
during
mental
activity
than
during
rest
unfortunately
we
can
not
do
this
directly
but
can
only
gauge
the
amount
of
in
the
urine
and
this
procedure
has
been
adopted
by
a
variety
of
observers
some
of
whom
found
the
phosphates
in
the
urine
diminished
whilst
others
found
them
increased
by
intellectual
work
on
the
whole
it
is
impossible
to
trace
any
constant
relation
in
maniacal
excitement
less
phosphorus
than
usual
seems
to
be
excreted
more
is
excreted
during
sleep
the
fact
that
may
do
good
in
nervous
exhaustion
proves
nothing
as
to
the
part
played
by
phosphorus
in
mental
activity
like
iron
arsenic
and
other
remedies
it
is
a
stimulant
or
tonic
of
whose
intimate
workings
in
the
system
we
know
absolutely
nothing
and
which
moreover
does
good
in
an
extremely
small
number
of
the
cases
in
which
it
is
prescribed
the
have
often
compared
thought
to
a
secretion
the
brain
secretes
thought
as
the
kidneys
secrete
urine
or
as
the
liver
secretes
bile
are
phrases
which
one
sometimes
hears
the
lame
analogy
need
hardly
be
pointed
out
the
materials
which
the
brain
into
the
cholesterin
creatin
xanthin
or
whatever
they
may
be
are
the
analogues
of
the
urine
and
the
bile
being
in
fact
real
material
excreta
as
far
as
these
matters
go
the
brain
is
a
ductless
gland
but
we
know
of
nothing
connected
with
which
can
be
in
the
remotest
degree
compared
with
the
stream
of
thought
that
accompanies
the
brain
material
secretions
chapter
x
habit
importance
for
there
remains
a
condition
of
general
neural
activity
so
important
as
to
deserve
a
chapter
by
itself
i
refer
to
the
aptitude
of
the
especially
of
the
hemispheres
for
acquiring
habits
acquired
habit
from
the
physiological
point
of
view
is
nothing
but
a
new
pathway
of
discharge
formed
in
the
brain
by
which
certain
incoming
currents
ever
after
tend
to
that
is
the
thesis
of
this
chapter
and
we
shall
see
in
the
later
and
more
psychological
chapters
that
such
functions
as
the
association
of
ideas
perception
memory
reasoning
the
education
of
the
will
can
best
be
understood
as
results
of
the
formation
of
just
such
pathways
of
discharge
has
a
physical
the
moment
one
tries
to
define
what
habit
is
one
is
led
to
the
fundamental
properties
of
matter
the
laws
of
nature
are
nothing
but
the
immutable
habits
which
the
different
elementary
sorts
of
matter
follow
in
their
actions
and
reactions
upon
each
other
in
the
organic
world
however
the
habits
are
more
variable
than
this
even
instincts
vary
from
one
individual
to
another
of
a
kind
and
are
modified
in
the
same
individual
as
we
shall
later
see
to
suit
the
exigencies
of
the
case
on
the
principles
of
the
atomistic
philosophy
the
habits
of
an
elementary
particle
of
matter
can
not
change
because
the
particle
is
itself
an
unchangeable
thing
but
those
of
a
compound
mass
of
matter
can
change
because
they
are
in
the
last
instance
due
to
the
structure
of
the
compound
and
either
outward
forces
or
inward
tensions
can
from
one
hour
to
another
turn
that
structure
into
something
different
from
what
it
was
that
is
they
can
do
so
if
the
body
be
plastic
enough
to
maintain
its
integrity
and
be
not
disrupted
when
its
structure
yields
the
change
of
structure
here
spoken
of
need
not
involve
the
outward
shape
it
may
be
invisible
and
molecular
as
when
a
bar
of
iron
becomes
magnetic
or
crystalline
through
the
action
of
certain
outward
causes
or
becomes
friable
or
plaster
all
these
changes
are
rather
slow
the
material
in
question
opposes
a
certain
resistance
to
the
modifying
cause
which
it
takes
time
to
overcome
but
the
gradual
yielding
whereof
often
saves
the
material
from
being
disintegrated
altogether
when
the
structure
has
yielded
the
same
inertia
becomes
a
condition
of
its
comparative
permanence
in
the
new
form
and
of
the
new
habits
the
body
then
manifests
then
in
the
wide
sense
of
the
word
means
the
possession
of
a
structure
weak
enough
to
yield
to
an
influence
but
strong
enough
not
to
yield
all
at
once
each
relatively
stable
phase
of
equilibrium
in
such
a
structure
is
marked
by
what
we
may
call
a
new
set
of
habits
organic
matter
especially
nervous
tissue
seems
endowed
with
a
very
extraordinary
degree
of
plasticity
of
this
sort
so
that
we
may
without
hesitation
lay
down
as
our
first
proposition
the
following
that
phenomena
of
habit
in
living
beings
are
due
to
the
plasticity
of
the
organic
materials
of
which
their
bodies
are
the
philosophy
of
habit
is
thus
in
the
first
instance
a
chapter
in
physics
rather
than
in
physiology
or
psychology
that
it
is
at
bottom
a
physical
principle
is
admitted
by
all
good
recent
writers
on
the
subject
they
call
attention
to
analogues
of
acquired
habits
exhibited
by
dead
matter
thus
lÃ©on
dumont
writes
every
one
knows
how
a
garment
after
having
been
worn
a
certain
time
clings
to
the
shape
of
the
body
better
than
when
it
was
new
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
tissue
and
this
change
is
a
new
habit
of
cohesion
a
lock
works
better
after
being
used
some
time
at
the
outset
more
force
was
required
to
overcome
certain
roughness
in
the
mechanism
the
overcoming
of
their
resistance
is
a
phenomenon
of
habituation
it
costs
less
trouble
to
fold
a
paper
when
it
has
been
folded
already
and
just
so
in
the
nervous
system
the
impressions
of
outer
objects
fashion
for
themselves
more
and
more
appropriate
paths
and
these
vital
phenomena
recur
under
similar
excitements
from
without
when
they
have
been
interrupted
a
certain
time
not
in
the
nervous
system
alone
a
scar
anywhere
is
a
minoris
more
liable
to
be
abraded
inflamed
to
suffer
pain
and
cold
than
are
the
neighboring
parts
a
sprained
ankle
a
dislocated
arm
are
in
danger
of
being
sprained
or
dislocated
again
joints
that
have
once
been
attacked
by
rheumatism
or
gout
mucous
membranes
that
have
been
the
seat
of
catarrh
are
with
each
fresh
recurrence
more
prone
to
a
relapse
until
often
the
morbid
state
chronically
substitutes
itself
for
the
sound
one
and
in
the
nervous
system
itself
it
is
well
known
how
many
functional
diseases
seem
to
keep
themselves
going
simply
because
they
happen
to
have
once
begun
and
how
the
forcible
cutting
short
by
medicine
of
a
few
attacks
is
often
sufficient
to
enable
the
physiological
forces
to
get
possession
of
the
field
again
and
to
bring
the
organs
back
to
functions
of
health
epilepsies
neuralgias
convulsive
affections
of
various
sorts
insomnias
are
so
many
cases
in
point
and
to
take
what
are
more
obviously
habits
the
success
with
which
a
treatment
can
often
be
applied
to
the
victims
of
unhealthy
indulgence
of
passion
or
of
mere
complaining
or
irascible
disposition
shows
us
how
much
the
morbid
manifestations
themselves
were
due
to
the
mere
inertia
of
the
nervous
organs
when
once
launched
on
a
false
career
are
due
to
pathways
through
the
if
habits
are
due
to
the
plasticity
of
materials
to
outward
agents
we
can
immediately
see
to
what
outward
influences
if
to
any
the
is
plastic
not
to
mechanical
pressures
not
to
thermal
changes
not
to
any
of
the
forces
to
which
all
the
other
organs
of
our
body
are
exposed
for
as
we
saw
on
pp
nature
has
so
blanketed
and
wrapped
the
brain
about
that
the
only
impressions
that
can
be
made
upon
it
are
through
the
blood
on
the
one
hand
and
the
sensory
on
the
other
and
it
is
to
the
infinitely
attenuated
currents
that
pour
in
through
these
latter
channels
that
the
hemispherical
cortex
shows
itself
to
be
so
peculiarly
susceptible
the
currents
once
in
must
find
a
way
out
in
getting
out
they
leave
their
traces
in
the
paths
which
they
take
the
only
thing
they
do
in
short
is
to
deepen
old
paths
or
to
make
new
ones
and
the
whole
plasticity
of
the
brain
sums
itself
up
in
two
words
when
we
call
it
an
organ
in
which
currents
pouring
in
from
the
make
with
extreme
facility
paths
which
do
not
easily
disappear
for
of
course
a
simple
habit
like
every
other
nervous
event
the
habit
of
snuffling
for
example
or
of
putting
one
hands
into
one
pockets
or
of
biting
one
nails
is
mechanically
nothing
but
a
reflex
discharge
and
its
anatomical
substratum
must
be
a
path
in
the
system
the
most
complex
habits
as
we
shall
presently
see
more
fully
are
from
the
same
point
of
view
nothing
but
discharges
in
the
due
to
the
presence
there
of
systems
of
reflex
paths
so
organized
as
to
wake
each
other
up
successively
the
impression
produced
by
one
muscular
contraction
serving
as
a
stimulus
to
provoke
the
next
until
a
final
impression
inhibits
the
process
and
closes
the
chain
it
must
be
noticed
that
the
growth
of
structural
modification
in
living
matter
may
be
more
rapid
than
in
any
lifeless
mass
because
the
incessant
nutritive
renovation
of
which
the
living
matter
is
the
seat
tends
often
to
corroborate
and
fix
the
impressed
modification
rather
than
to
counteract
it
by
renewing
the
original
constitution
of
the
tissue
that
has
been
impressed
thus
we
notice
after
exercising
our
muscles
or
our
brain
in
a
new
way
that
we
can
do
so
no
longer
at
that
time
but
after
a
day
or
two
of
rest
when
we
resume
the
discipline
our
increase
in
skill
not
seldom
surprises
us
i
have
often
noticed
this
in
learning
a
tune
and
it
has
led
a
german
author
to
say
that
we
learn
to
swim
during
the
winter
and
to
skate
during
the
summer

man
is
born
with
a
tendency
to
do
more
things
than
he
has
arrangements
for
in
his
most
of
the
performances
of

are
automatic
but
in
him
the
number
of
them
is
so
enormous
that
most
of
them
must
be
the
fruit
of
painful
study

did
not

the
expense

he
would

maudsley
says

no
easier

being
done
several
times
if
the
careful
direction
of
consciousness
were
necessary
to
its
accomplishment
on
each
occasion
it
is
evident
that
the
whole
activity
of
a
lifetime
might
be
confined
to
one
or
two
deeds
that
no

could
take
place

be
occupied
all

in

would
absorb

his

and
energy
the
washing
of
his
hands
or
the
fastening
of
a
button
would
be
as
difficult
to
him
on
each
occasion
as
to
the
child
on
its
first
trial
and
he
would
furthermore
be
completely
exhausted
by
his
exertions
think
of
the
pains
necessary
to
teach
a
child
to
stand
of
the
many
efforts
which
it
must
make
and
of
the
ease
with
which
it
at
last
stands
unconscious
of
any
effort
for
while
acts
are
accomplished
with
comparatively
little
weariness
in
this
regard
approaching
the
organic
movements
or
the
original
reflex
movements
the
conscious
effort
of
the
will
soon
produces
exhaustion
a
spinal
cord
without
memory
would
simply
be
an
idiotic
spinal
cord
it
is
impossible
for
an
individual
to
realize
how
much
he
owes
to
its
automatic
agency
until
disease
has
impaired
its
functions
secondly
diminishes
the
conscious
attention
with
which
our
acts
are
one
may
state
this
abstractly
thus
if
an
act
require
for
its
execution
a
chain
b
c
d
e
f
of
successive
nervous
events
then
in
the
first
performances
of
the
action
the
conscious
will
must
choose
each
of
these
events
from
a
number
of
wrong
alternatives
that
tend
to
present
themselves
but
habit
soon
brings
it
about
that
each
event
calls
up
its
own
appropriate
successor
without
any
alternative
offering
itself
and
without
any
reference
to
the
conscious
will
until
at
last
the
whole
chain
b
c
d
e
f
rattles
itself
off
as
soon
as
occurs
just
as
if
and
the
rest
of
the
chain
were
fused
into
a
continuous
stream
whilst
we
are
learning
to
walk
to
ride
to
swim
skate
fence
write
play
or
sing
we
interrupt
ourselves
at
every
step
by
unnecessary
movements
and
false
notes
when
we
are
proficients
on
the
contrary
the
results
follow
not
only
with
the
very
minimum
of
muscular
action
requisite
to
bring
them
forth
but
they
follow
from
a
single
instantaneous
the
marksman
sees
the
bird
and
before
he
knows
it
he
has
aimed
and
shot
a
gleam
in
his
adversary
eye
a
momentary
pressure
from
his
rapier
and
the
fencer
finds
that
he
has
instantly
made
the
right
parry
and
return
a
glance
at
the
musical
hieroglyphics
and
the
pianist
fingers
have
rippled
through
a
shower
of
notes
and
not
only
is
it
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
that
we
thus
involuntarily
do
but
the
wrong
thing
also
if
it
be
an
habitual
thing
who
is
there
that
has
never
wound
up
his
watch
on
taking
off
his
waistcoat
in
the
daytime
or
taken
his
out
on
arriving
at
the
of
a
friend
persons
in
going
to
their
bedroom
to
dress
for
dinner
have
been
known
to
take
off
one
garment
after
another
and
finally
to
get
into
bed
merely
because
that
was
the
habitual
issue
of
the
first
few
movements
when
performed
at
a
later
hour
we
all
have
a
definite
routine
manner
of
performing
certain
daily
offices
connected
with
the
toilet
with
the
opening
and
shutting
of
familiar
cupboards
and
the
like
but
our
higher
know
hardly
anything
about
the
matter
few
men
can
tell
which
sock
shoe
or
they
put
on
first
they
must
first
mentally
rehearse
the
act
and
even
that
is
often
insufficient
the
act
must
be
so
of
the
questions
which
valve
of
the
shutters
opens
first
which
way
does
my
door
swing
etc
i
can
not
the
answer
yet
my
never
makes
a
mistake
no
one
can
the
order
in
which
he
brushes
his
hair
or
teeth
yet
it
is
likely
that
the
order
is
a
pretty
fixed
one
in
all
of
us
these
results
may
be
expressed
as
follows
in
action
grown
habitual
what
instigates
each
new
muscular
contraction
to
take
place
in
its
appointed
order
is
not
a
thought
or
a
perception
but
the
occasioned
by
the
muscular
contraction
just
a
strictly
voluntary
act
has
to
be
guided
by
idea
perception
and
volition
throughout
its
whole
course
in
habitual
action
mere
sensation
is
a
sufficient
guide
and
the
upper
regions
of
brain
and
mind
are
set
comparatively
free
a
diagram
will
make
the
matter
clear
illustration
fig
let
b

f
represent
an
habitual
chain
of
muscular
contractions
and
let
b
c
d
e
stand
for
the
several
sensations
which
these
contractions
excite
in
us
when
they
are
successively
performed
such
sensations
will
usually
be
in
the
parts
moved
but
they
may
also
be
effects
of
the
movement
upon
the
eye
or
the
ear
through
them
and
through
them
alone
we
are
made
aware
whether
or
not
the
contraction
has
occurred
when
the
series
b
c
d
e
f
is
being
learned
each
of
these
sensations
becomes
the
object
of
a
separate
act
of
attention
by
the
mind
we
test
each
movement
intellectually
to
see
if
it
have
been
rightly
performed
before
advancing
to
the
next
we
hesitate
compare
choose
revoke
reject
etc
and
the
order
by
which
the
next
movement
is
discharged
is
an
express
order
from
the
ideational
centres
after
this
deliberation
has
been
gone
through
in
habitual
action
on
the
contrary
the
only
impulse
which
the
intellectual
centres
need
send
down
is
that
which
carries
the
command
to
this
is
represented
in
the
diagram
by
it
may
be
a
thought
of
the
first
movement
or
of
the
last
result
or
a
mere
perception
of
some
of
the
habitual
conditions
of
the
chain
the
presence
of
the
keyboard
near
the
hand
in
the
present
example
no
sooner
has
this
conscious
thought
or
volition
instigated
movement
than
through
the
sensation
of
its
own
occurrence
awakens
reflexly
then
excites
through
and
so
on
till
the
chain
is
ended
when
the
intellect
generally
takes
cognizance
of
the
final
result
the
intellectual
perception
at
the
end
is
indicated
in
the
diagram
by
the
sensible
effect
of
the
movement
being
represented
at
in
the
ideational
centres
above
the
merely
sensational
line
the
sensational
impressions
b
c
d
e
are
all
supposed
to
have
their
seat
below
the
ideational
level
depend
on
sensations
not
attended
we
have
called
b
c
d
e
by
the
name
of
if
sensations
they
are
sensations
to
which
we
are
usually
inattentive
but
that
they
are
more
than
unconscious
seems
certain
for
they
catch
our
attention
if
they
go
wrong
schneider
account
of
these
sensations
deserves
to
be
quoted
in
the
act
of
walking
he
says
even
when
our
attention
is
entirely
absorbed
elsewhere
it
is
doubtful
whether
we
could
preserve
equilibrium
if
no
sensation
of
our
body
attitude
were
there
and
doubtful
whether
we
should
advance
our
leg
if
we
had
no
sensation
of
its
movement
as
executed
and
not
even
a
minimal
feeling
of
impulse
to
set
it
down
knitting
appears
altogether
mechanical
and
the
knitter
keeps
up
her
knitting
even
while
she
reads
or
is
engaged
in
lively
talk
but
if
we
ask
her
how
this
is
possible
she
will
hardly
reply
that
the
knitting
goes
on
of
itself
she
will
rather
say
that
she
has
a
feeling
of
it
that
she
feels
in
her
hands
that
she
knits
and
how
she
must
knit
and
that
therefore
the
movements
of
knitting
are
called
forth
and
regulated
by
the
sensations
associated
therewithal
even
when
the
attention
is
called
away
again
when
a
pupil
begins
to
play
on
the
violin
to
keep
him
from
raising
his
right
elbow
in
playing
a
book
is
placed
under
his
right
armpit
which
he
is
ordered
to
hold
fast
by
keeping
the
upper
arm
tight
against
his
body
the
muscular
feelings
and
feelings
of
contact
connected
with
the
book
provoke
an
impulse
to
press
it
tight
but
often
it
happens
that
the
beginner
whose
attention
gets
absorbed
in
the
production
of
the
notes
lets
drop
the
book
later
however
this
never
happens
the
faintest
sensations
of
contact
suffice
to
awaken
the
impulse
to
keep
it
in
its
place
and
the
attention
may
be
wholly
absorbed
by
the
notes
and
the
fingering
with
the
left
hand
simultaneous
combination
of
movements
is
thus
in
the
first
instance
conditioned
by
the
facility
with
which
in
us
alongside
of
intellectual
processes
processes
of
inattentive
feeling
may
still
go
and
pedagogical
importance
of
the
principle
of
habit
a
second
nature
habit
is
ten
times
nature
the
duke
of
wellington
is
said
to
have
exclaimed
and
the
degree
to
which
this
is
true
no
one
probably
can
appreciate
as
well
as
one
who
is
a
veteran
soldier
himself
the
daily
drill
and
the
years
of
discipline
end
by
fashioning
a
man
completely
over
again
as
to
most
of
the
possibilities
of
his
conduct
there
is
a
story
says
huxley
which
is
credible
enough
though
it
may
not
be
true
of
a
practical
joker
who
seeing
a
discharged
veteran
carrying
home
his
dinner
suddenly
called
out
whereupon
the
man
instantly
brought
his
hands
down
and
lost
his
mutton
and
potatoes
in
the
gutter
the
drill
had
been
thorough
and
its
effects
had
become
embodied
in
the
man
nervous
structure
riderless
at
many
a
battle
have
been
seen
to
come
together
and
go
through
their
customary
evolutions
at
the
sound
of
the
most
domestic
beasts
seem
machines
almost
pure
and
simple
undoubtingly
unhesitatingly
doing
from
minute
to
minute
the
duties
they
have
been
taught
and
giving
no
sign
that
the
possibility
of
an
alternative
ever
suggests
itself
to
their
mind
men
grown
old
in
prison
have
asked
to
be
readmitted
after
being
once
set
free
in
a
railroad
accident
a
whose
cage
had
broken
open
is
said
to
have
emerged
but
presently
crept
back
again
as
if
too
much
bewildered
by
his
new
responsibilities
so
that
he
was
without
difficulty
secured
habit
is
thus
the
enormous
of
society
its
most
precious
conservative
agent
it
alone
is
what
keeps
us
all
within
the
bounds
of
ordinance
and
saves
the
children
of
fortune
from
the
envious
uprisings
of
the
poor
it
alone
prevents
the
hardest
and
most
repulsive
walks
of
life
from
being
deserted
by
those
brought
up
to
tread
therein
it
keeps
the
fisherman
and
the
at
sea
through
the
winter
it
holds
the
miner
in
his
darkness
and
nails
the
countryman
to
his
and
his
lonely
farm
through
all
the
months
of
snow
it
protects
us
from
invasion
by
the
natives
of
the
desert
and
the
frozen
zone
it
dooms
us
all
to
fight
out
the
battle
of
life
upon
the
lines
of
our
nurture
or
our
early
choice
and
to
make
the
best
of
a
pursuit
that
disagrees
because
there
is
no
other
for
which
we
are
fitted
and
it
is
too
late
to
begin
again
it
keeps
different
social
strata
from
mixing
already
at
the
age
of
you
see
the
professional
mannerism
settling
down
on
the
young
commercial
traveller
on
the
young
doctor
on
the
young
minister
on
the
young
you
see
the
little
lines
of
cleavage
running
through
the
character
the
tricks
of
thought
the
prejudices
the
ways
of
the
in
a
word
from
which
the
man
can
no
more
escape
than
his
can
suddenly
fall
into
a
new
set
of
folds
on
the
whole
it
is
best
he
should
not
escape
it
is
well
for
the
world
that
in
most
of
us
by
the
age
of
thirty
the
character
has
set
like
plaster
and
will
never
soften
again
if
the
period
between
twenty
and
thirty
is
the
critical
one
in
the
formation
of
intellectual
and
professional
habits
the
period
below
twenty
is
more
important
still
for
the
fixing
of
habits
properly
so
called
such
as
vocalization
and
pronunciation
gesture
motion
and
address
hardly
ever
is
a
language
learned
after
twenty
spoken
without
a
foreign
accent
hardly
ever
can
a
youth
transferred
to
the
society
of
his
betters
unlearn
the
nasality
and
other
vices
of
speech
bred
in
him
by
the
associations
of
his
growing
years
hardly
ever
indeed
no
matter
how
much
money
there
be
in
his
pocket
can
he
even
learn
to
like
a
the
merchants
offer
their
wares
as
eagerly
to
him
as
to
the
veriest
but
he
simply
buy
the
right
things
an
invisible
law
as
strong
as
gravitation
keeps
him
within
his
orbit
arrayed
this
year
as
he
was
the
last
and
how
his
acquaintances
contrive
to
get
the
things
they
wear
will
be
for
him
a
mystery
till
his
dying
day
the
great
thing
then
in
all
education
is
to
our
nervous
system
our
ally
instead
of
our
it
is
to
fund
and
capitalize
our
acquisitions
and
live
at
ease
upon
the
interest
of
the
fund
this
we
must
make
automatic
and
habitual
as
early
as
possible
as
many
useful
actions
as
we
and
guard
against
the
growing
into
ways
that
are
likely
to
be
disadvantageous
to
us
as
we
should
guard
against
the
plague
the
more
of
the
details
of
our
daily
life
we
can
hand
over
to
the
effortless
custody
of
automatism
the
more
our
higher
powers
of
mind
will
be
set
free
for
their
own
proper
work
there
is
no
more
miserable
human
being
than
one
in
whom
nothing
is
habitual
but
indecision
and
for
whom
the
lighting
of
every
cigar
the
drinking
of
every
cup
the
time
of
rising
and
going
to
bed
every
day
and
the
beginning
of
every
bit
of
work
are
subjects
of
express
volitional
deliberation
full
half
the
time
of
such
a
man
goes
to
the
deciding
or
regretting
of
matters
which
ought
to
be
so
ingrained
in
him
as
practically
not
to
exist
for
his
consciousness
at
all
if
there
be
such
daily
duties
not
yet
ingrained
in
any
one
of
my
readers
let
him
begin
this
very
hour
to
set
the
matter
right
in
professor
bain
chapter
on
moral
habits
there
are
some
admirable
practical
remarks
laid
down
two
great
maxims
emerge
from
his
treatment
the
first
is
that
in
the
acquisition
of
a
new
habit
or
the
leaving
off
of
an
old
one
we
must
take
care
to
ourselves
with
as
strong
and
decided
an
initiative
as
accumulate
all
the
possible
circumstances
which
shall
the
right
motives
put
yourself
assiduously
in
conditions
that
encourage
the
new
way
make
engagements
incompatible
with
the
old
take
a
public
pledge
if
the
case
allows
in
short
envelop
your
resolution
with
every
aid
you
know
this
will
give
your
new
beginning
such
a
momentum
that
the
temptation
to
break
down
will
not
occur
as
soon
as
it
otherwise
might
and
every
day
during
which
a
breakdown
is
postponed
adds
to
the
chances
of
its
not
occurring
at
all
the
second
maxim
is
suffer
an
exception
to
occur
till
the
new
habit
is
securely
rooted
in
your
each
lapse
is
like
the
letting
fall
of
a
ball
of
string
which
one
is
carefully
winding
up
a
single
slip
undoes
more
than
a
great
many
turns
will
wind
again
of
training
is
the
great
means
of
making
the
nervous
system
act
infallibly
right
as
professor
bain
says
the
peculiarity
of
the
moral
habits
contradistinguishing
them
from
the
intellectual
acquisitions
is
the
presence
of
two
hostile
powers
one
to
be
gradually
raised
into
the
ascendant
over
the
other
it
is
necessary
above
all
things
in
such
a
situation
never
to
lose
a
battle
every
gain
on
the
wrong
side
undoes
the
effect
of
many
conquests
on
the
right
the
essential
precaution
therefore
is
so
to
regulate
the
two
opposing
powers
that
the
one
may
have
a
series
of
uninterrupted
successes
until
repetition
has
fortified
it
to
such
a
degree
as
to
enable
it
to
cope
with
the
opposition
under
any
circumstances
this
is
the
theoretically
best
career
of
mental
progress
the
need
of
securing
success
at
the
is
imperative
failure
at
first
is
apt
to
damp
the
energy
of
all
future
attempts
whereas
past
experiences
of
success
nerve
one
to
future
vigor
goethe
says
to
a
man
who
consulted
him
about
an
enterprise
but
mistrusted
his
own
powers
ach
you
need
only
blow
on
your
hands
and
the
remark
illustrates
the
effect
on
goethe
spirits
of
his
own
habitually
successful
career
the
question
of
in
abandoning
such
habits
as
drink
and
comes
in
here
and
is
a
question
about
which
experts
differ
within
certain
limits
and
in
regard
to
what
may
be
best
for
an
individual
case
in
the
main
however
all
expert
opinion
would
agree
that
abrupt
acquisition
of
the
new
habit
is
the
best
way
there
be
a
real
possibility
of
carrying
it
we
must
be
careful
not
to
give
the
will
so
stiff
a
task
as
to
insure
its
defeat
at
the
very
outset
but
one
can
stand
a
sharp
period
of
suffering
and
then
a
free
time
is
the
best
thing
to
aim
at
whether
in
giving
up
a
habit
like
that
of
opium
or
in
simply
changing
one
hours
of
rising
or
of
work
it
is
surprising
how
soon
a
desire
will
die
of
inanition
if
it
be
fed
one
must
first
learn
unmoved
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
left
to
walk
firmly
on
the
strait
and
narrow
path
before
one
can
begin
make
one
self
over
again
he
who
every
day
makes
a
fresh
resolve
is
like
one
who
arriving
at
the
edge
of
the
ditch
he
is
to
leap
forever
stops
and
returns
for
a
fresh
run
without
advance
there
is
no
such
thing
as
of
the
ethical
forces
possible
and
to
make
this
possible
and
to
exercise
us
and
habituate
us
in
it
is
the
sovereign
blessing
of
regular
work
a
third
maxim
may
be
added
to
the
preceding
pair
the
very
first
possible
opportunity
to
act
on
every
resolution
you
make
and
on
every
emotional
prompting
you
may
experience
in
the
direction
of
the
habits
you
aspire
to
it
is
not
in
the
moment
of
their
forming
but
in
the
moment
of
their
producing
that
resolves
and
aspirations
communicate
the
new
to
the
brain
as
the
author
last
quoted
remarks
the
actual
presence
of
the
practical
opportunity
alone
furnishes
the
fulcrum
upon
which
the
lever
can
rest
by
means
of
which
the
moral
will
may
multiply
its
strength
and
raise
itself
aloft
he
who
has
no
solid
ground
to
press
against
will
never
get
beyond
the
stage
of
empty
no
matter
how
full
a
reservoir
of
one
may
possess
and
no
matter
how
good
one
may
be
if
one
have
not
taken
advantage
of
every
concrete
opportunity
to
one
character
may
remain
entirely
unaffected
for
the
better
with
mere
good
intentions
hell
is
proverbially
paved
and
this
is
an
obvious
consequence
of
the
principles
we
have
laid
down
a
as
mill
says
a
completely
fashioned
will
and
a
will
in
the
sense
in
which
he
means
it
is
an
aggregate
of
tendencies
to
act
in
a
firm
and
prompt
and
definite
way
upon
all
the
principal
emergencies
of
life
a
tendency
to
act
only
becomes
effectively
ingrained
in
us
in
proportion
to
the
uninterrupted
frequency
with
which
the
actions
actually
occur
and
the
brain
to
their
use
when
a
resolve
or
a
fine
glow
of
feeling
is
allowed
to
evaporate
without
bearing
practical
fruit
it
is
worse
than
a
chance
lost
it
works
so
as
positively
to
hinder
future
resolutions
and
emotions
from
taking
the
normal
path
of
discharge
there
is
no
more
contemptible
type
of
human
character
than
that
of
the
nerveless
sentimentalist
and
dreamer
who
spends
his
life
in
a
weltering
sea
of
sensibility
and
emotion
but
who
never
does
a
manly
concrete
deed
rousseau
inflaming
all
the
mothers
of
france
by
his
eloquence
to
follow
nature
and
nurse
their
babies
themselves
while
he
sends
his
own
children
to
the
foundling
hospital
is
the
classical
example
of
what
i
mean
but
every
one
of
us
in
his
measure
whenever
after
glowing
for
an
abstractly
formulated
good
he
practically
ignores
some
actual
case
among
the
squalid
particulars
of
which
that
same
good
lurks
disguised
treads
straight
on
rousseau
path
all
goods
are
disguised
by
the
vulgarity
of
their
concomitants
in
this
world
but
woe
to
him
who
can
only
recognize
them
when
he
thinks
them
in
their
pure
and
abstract
form
the
habit
of
excessive
and
will
produce
true
monsters
in
this
line
the
weeping
of
the
russian
lady
over
the
fictitious
personages
in
the
play
while
her
coachman
is
freezing
to
death
on
his
seat
outside
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
everywhere
happens
on
a
less
glaring
scale
even
the
habit
of
excessive
indulgence
in
music
for
those
who
are
neither
performers
themselves
nor
musically
gifted
enough
to
take
it
in
a
purely
intellectual
way
has
probably
a
relaxing
effect
upon
the
character
one
becomes
filled
with
emotions
which
habitually
pass
without
prompting
to
any
deed
and
so
the
inertly
sentimental
condition
is
kept
up
the
remedy
would
be
never
to
suffer
one
self
to
have
an
emotion
at
a
concert
without
expressing
it
afterward
in
active
way
let
the
expression
be
the
least
thing
in
the
world
speaking
genially
to
grandmother
or
giving
up
one
seat
in
a
if
nothing
more
heroic
offers
but
let
it
not
fail
to
take
place
these
latter
cases
make
us
aware
that
it
is
not
simply
of
discharge
but
also
of
discharge
that
seem
to
be
grooved
out
by
habit
in
the
brain
just
as
if
we
let
our
emotions
evaporate
they
get
into
a
way
of
evaporating
so
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
if
we
often
flinch
from
making
an
effort
before
we
know
it
the
capacity
will
be
gone
and
that
if
we
suffer
the
wandering
of
our
attention
presently
it
will
wander
all
the
time
attention
and
effort
are
as
we
shall
see
later
but
two
names
for
the
same
psychic
fact
to
what
they
correspond
we
do
not
know
the
strongest
reason
for
believing
that
they
do
depend
on
at
all
and
are
not
pure
acts
of
the
spirit
is
just
this
fact
that
they
seem
in
some
degree
subject
to
the
law
of
habit
which
is
a
material
law
as
a
final
practical
maxim
relative
to
these
habits
of
the
will
we
may
then
offer
something
like
this
the
faculty
of
effort
alive
in
you
by
a
little
gratuitous
exercise
every
that
is
be
systematically
ascetic
or
heroic
in
little
unnecessary
points
do
every
day
or
two
something
for
no
other
reason
than
that
you
would
rather
not
do
it
so
that
when
the
hour
of
dire
need
draws
nigh
it
may
find
you
not
unnerved
and
untrained
to
stand
the
test
asceticism
of
this
sort
is
like
the
insurance
which
a
man
pays
on
his
house
and
goods
the
tax
does
him
no
good
at
the
time
and
possibly
may
never
bring
him
a
return
but
if
the
fire
come
his
having
paid
it
will
be
his
salvation
from
ruin
so
with
the
man
who
has
daily
inured
himself
to
habits
of
concentrated
attention
energetic
volition
and
in
unnecessary
things
he
will
stand
like
a
tower
when
everything
rocks
around
him
and
when
his
softer
are
winnowed
like
chaff
in
the
blast
the
physiological
study
of
mental
conditions
is
thus
the
most
powerful
ally
of
hortatory
ethics
the
hell
to
be
endured
hereafter
of
which
theology
tells
is
no
worse
than
the
hell
we
make
for
ourselves
in
this
world
by
habitually
fashioning
our
characters
in
the
wrong
way
could
the
young
but
realize
how
soon
they
will
become
mere
walking
bundles
of
habits
they
would
give
more
heed
to
their
conduct
while
in
the
plastic
state
we
are
spinning
our
own
fates
good
or
evil
and
never
to
be
undone
every
smallest
stroke
of
virtue
or
of
vice
leaves
its
never
so
little
scar
the
drunken
rip
van
winkle
in
jefferson
play
excuses
himself
for
every
fresh
dereliction
by
saying
wo
count
this
time
well
he
may
not
count
it
and
a
kind
heaven
may
not
count
it
but
it
is
being
counted
none
the
less
down
among
his
and
fibres
the
molecules
are
counting
it
registering
and
storing
it
up
to
be
used
against
him
when
the
next
temptation
comes
nothing
we
ever
do
is
in
strict
scientific
literalness
wiped
out
of
course
this
has
its
good
side
as
well
as
its
bad
one
as
we
become
permanent
drunkards
by
so
many
separate
drinks
so
we
become
saints
in
the
moral
and
authorities
and
experts
in
the
practical
and
scientific
spheres
by
so
many
separate
acts
and
hours
of
work
let
no
youth
have
any
anxiety
about
the
upshot
of
his
education
whatever
the
line
of
it
may
be
if
he
keep
faithfully
busy
each
hour
of
the
working
day
he
may
safely
leave
the
final
result
to
itself
he
can
with
perfect
certainty
count
on
waking
up
some
fine
morning
to
find
himself
one
of
the
competent
ones
of
his
generation
in
whatever
pursuit
he
may
have
singled
out
silently
between
all
the
details
of
his
business
the
of
in
all
that
class
of
matter
will
have
built
itself
up
within
him
as
a
possession
that
will
never
pass
away
young
people
should
know
this
truth
in
advance
the
ignorance
of
it
has
probably
engendered
more
discouragement
and
in
youths
embarking
on
arduous
careers
than
all
other
causes
put
together
chapter
xi
the
stream
of
consciousness
order
of
our
study
must
be
we
are
now
prepared
to
begin
the
introspective
study
of
the
adult
consciousness
itself
most
books
adopt
the
synthetic
method
starting
with
ideas
of
sensation
and
regarding
these
as
so
many
atoms
they
proceed
to
build
up
the
higher
states
of
mind
out
of
their
or
as
houses
are
built
by
the
agglutination
of
bricks
this
has
the
didactic
advantages
which
the
synthetic
method
usually
has
but
it
commits
one
beforehand
to
the
very
questionable
theory
that
our
higher
states
of
consciousness
are
compounds
of
units
and
instead
of
starting
with
what
the
reader
directly
knows
namely
his
total
concrete
states
of
mind
it
starts
with
a
set
of
supposed
ideas
with
which
he
has
no
immediate
acquaintance
at
all
and
concerning
whose
alleged
interactions
he
is
much
at
the
mercy
of
any
plausible
phrase
on
every
ground
then
the
method
of
advancing
from
the
simple
to
the
compound
exposes
us
to
illusion
all
pedants
and
abstractionists
will
naturally
hate
to
abandon
it
but
a
student
who
loves
the
fulness
of
human
nature
will
prefer
to
follow
the
method
and
to
begin
with
the
most
concrete
facts
those
with
which
he
has
a
daily
acquaintance
in
his
own
inner
life
the
analytic
method
will
discover
in
due
time
the
elementary
parts
if
such
exist
without
danger
of
precipitate
assumption
the
reader
will
bear
in
mind
that
our
own
chapters
on
sensation
have
dealt
mainly
with
the
physiological
conditions
thereof
they
were
put
first
as
a
mere
matter
of
convenience
because
incoming
currents
come
first
they
might
better
have
come
last
pure
sensations
were
described
on
page
as
processes
which
in
adult
life
are
unknown
and
nothing
was
said
which
could
for
a
moment
lead
the
reader
to
suppose
that
they
were
the
of
of
the
higher
states
of
mind
fundamental
the
first
and
foremost
concrete
fact
which
every
one
will
affirm
to
belong
to
his
inner
experience
is
the
fact
that
of
some
sort
goes
on
of
mind
succeed
each
other
in
if
we
could
say
in
english
thinks
as
we
say
rains
or
blows
we
should
be
stating
the
fact
most
simply
and
with
the
minimum
of
assumption
as
we
can
not
we
must
simply
say
that
goes
characters
in
how
does
it
go
on
we
notice
immediately
four
important
characters
in
the
process
of
which
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
present
chapter
to
treat
in
a
general
way
every
tends
to
be
part
of
a
personal
consciousness
within
each
personal
consciousness
states
are
always
changing
each
personal
consciousness
is
sensibly
continuous
it
is
interested
in
some
parts
of
its
object
to
the
exclusion
of
others
and
welcomes
or
rejects
from
among
them
in
a
word
all
the
while
in
considering
these
four
points
successively
we
shall
have
to
plunge
medias
as
regards
our
nomenclature
and
use
psychological
terms
which
can
only
be
adequately
defined
in
later
chapters
of
the
book
but
every
one
knows
what
the
terms
mean
in
a
rough
way
and
it
is
only
in
a
rough
way
that
we
are
now
to
take
them
this
chapter
is
like
a
first
charcoal
sketch
upon
his
canvas
in
which
no
niceties
appear
when
i
say
or
is
part
of
a
personal
consciousness
is
one
of
the
terms
in
question
its
meaning
we
know
so
long
as
no
one
asks
us
to
define
it
but
to
give
an
accurate
account
of
it
is
the
most
difficult
of
philosophic
tasks
this
task
we
must
confront
in
the
next
chapter
here
a
preliminary
word
will
suffice
in
this
room
this
say
there
are
a
multitude
of
thoughts
yours
and
mine
some
of
which
cohere
mutually
and
some
not
they
are
as
little
and
reciprocally
independent
as
they
are
they
are
neither
no
one
of
them
is
separate
but
each
belongs
with
certain
others
and
with
none
beside
my
thought
belongs
with
other
thoughts
and
your
thought
with
other
thoughts
whether
anywhere
in
the
room
there
be
a
thought
which
is
nobody
thought
we
have
no
means
of
ascertaining
for
we
have
no
experience
of
its
like
the
only
states
of
consciousness
that
we
naturally
deal
with
are
found
in
personal
consciousnesses
minds
selves
concrete
particular
i
and
you
each
of
these
minds
keeps
its
own
thoughts
to
itself
there
is
no
giving
or
bartering
between
them
no
thought
even
comes
into
direct
of
a
thought
in
another
personal
consciousness
than
its
own
absolute
insulation
irreducible
pluralism
is
the
law
it
seems
as
if
the
elementary
psychic
fact
were
not
or
or
but
every
thought
being
neither
contemporaneity
nor
proximity
in
space
nor
similarity
of
quality
and
content
are
able
to
fuse
thoughts
together
which
are
sundered
by
this
barrier
of
belonging
to
different
personal
minds
the
breaches
between
such
thoughts
are
the
most
absolute
breaches
in
nature
every
one
will
recognize
this
to
be
true
so
long
as
the
existence
of
corresponding
to
the
term
mind
is
all
that
is
insisted
on
without
any
particular
view
of
its
nature
being
implied
on
these
terms
the
personal
self
rather
than
the
thought
might
be
treated
as
the
immediate
datum
in
psychology
the
universal
conscious
fact
is
not
and
thoughts
exist
but
think
and
feel
no
psychology
at
any
rate
can
question
the
of
personal
selves
thoughts
connected
as
we
feel
them
to
be
connected
are
we
by
personal
selves
the
worst
a
psychology
can
do
is
so
to
interpret
the
nature
of
these
selves
as
to
rob
them
of
their
is
in
constant
i
do
not
mean
by
this
to
say
that
no
one
state
of
mind
has
any
duration
even
if
true
that
would
be
hard
to
establish
what
i
wish
to
lay
stress
on
is
this
that
state
once
gone
can
recur
and
be
identical
with
what
it
was
now
we
are
seeing
now
hearing
now
reasoning
now
willing
now
recollecting
now
expecting
now
loving
now
hating
and
in
a
hundred
other
ways
we
know
our
minds
to
be
alternately
engaged
but
all
these
are
complex
states
it
may
be
said
produced
by
combination
of
simpler
ones
do
not
the
simpler
ones
follow
a
different
law
are
not
the
which
we
get
from
the
same
object
for
example
always
the
same
does
not
the
same
struck
with
the
same
force
make
us
hear
in
the
same
way
does
not
the
same
grass
give
us
the
same
feeling
of
green
the
same
sky
the
same
feeling
of
blue
and
do
we
not
get
the
same
olfactory
sensation
no
matter
how
many
times
we
put
our
nose
to
the
same
flask
of
cologne
it
seems
a
piece
of
metaphysical
sophistry
to
suggest
that
we
do
not
and
yet
a
close
attention
to
the
matter
shows
that
is
no
proof
that
an
incoming
current
ever
gives
us
just
the
same
bodily
sensation
is
got
twice
is
the
object
we
hear
the
same
over
and
over
again
we
see
the
same
of
green
or
smell
the
same
objective
perfume
or
experience
the
same
of
pain
the
realities
concrete
and
abstract
physical
and
ideal
whose
permanent
existence
we
believe
in
seem
to
be
constantly
coming
up
again
before
our
thought
and
lead
us
in
our
carelessness
to
suppose
that
our
of
them
are
the
same
ideas
when
we
come
some
time
later
to
the
chapter
on
perception
we
shall
see
how
inveterate
is
our
habit
of
simply
using
our
sensible
impressions
as
to
pass
over
to
the
recognition
of
the
realities
whose
presence
they
reveal
the
grass
out
of
the
window
now
looks
to
me
of
the
same
green
in
the
sun
as
in
the
shade
and
yet
a
painter
would
have
to
paint
one
part
of
it
dark
brown
another
part
bright
yellow
to
give
its
real
sensational
effect
we
take
no
heed
as
a
rule
of
the
different
way
in
which
the
same
things
look
and
sound
and
smell
at
different
distances
and
under
different
circumstances
the
sameness
of
the
is
what
we
are
concerned
to
ascertain
and
any
sensations
that
assure
us
of
that
will
probably
be
considered
in
a
rough
way
to
be
the
same
with
each
other
this
is
what
makes
testimony
about
the
subjective
identity
of
different
sensations
worthless
as
a
proof
of
the
fact
the
entire
history
of
what
is
called
sensation
is
a
commentary
on
our
inability
to
tell
whether
two
sensible
qualities
received
apart
are
exactly
alike
what
appeals
to
our
attention
far
more
than
the
absolute
quality
of
an
impression
is
its
to
whatever
other
impressions
we
may
have
at
the
same
time
when
everything
is
dark
a
somewhat
less
dark
sensation
makes
us
see
an
object
white
helmholtz
calculates
that
the
white
marble
painted
in
a
picture
representing
an
architectural
view
by
moonlight
is
when
seen
by
daylight
from
ten
to
twenty
thousand
times
brighter
than
the
real
moonlit
marble
would
be
such
a
difference
as
this
could
never
have
been
learned
it
had
to
be
inferred
from
a
series
of
indirect
considerations
these
make
us
believe
that
our
sensibility
is
altering
all
the
time
so
that
the
same
object
can
not
easily
give
us
the
same
sensation
over
again
we
feel
things
differently
accordingly
as
we
are
sleepy
or
awake
hungry
or
full
fresh
or
tired
differently
at
night
and
in
the
morning
differently
in
summer
and
in
winter
and
above
all
differently
in
childhood
manhood
and
old
age
and
yet
we
never
doubt
that
our
feelings
reveal
the
same
world
with
the
same
sensible
qualities
and
the
same
sensible
things
occupying
it
the
difference
of
the
sensibility
is
shown
best
by
the
difference
of
our
emotion
about
the
things
from
one
age
to
another
or
when
we
are
in
different
organic
moods
what
was
bright
and
exciting
becomes
weary
flat
and
unprofitable
the
song
is
tedious
the
breeze
is
mournful
the
sky
is
sad
to
these
indirect
presumptions
that
our
sensations
following
the
mutations
of
our
capacity
for
feeling
are
always
undergoing
an
essential
change
must
be
added
another
presumption
based
on
what
must
happen
in
the
brain
every
sensation
corresponds
to
some
cerebral
action
for
an
identical
sensation
to
recur
it
would
have
to
occur
the
second
time
an
unmodified
but
as
this
strictly
speaking
is
a
physiological
impossibility
so
is
an
unmodified
feeling
an
impossibility
for
to
every
however
small
we
suppose
that
there
must
correspond
a
change
of
equal
amount
in
the
consciousness
which
the
brain
subserves
but
if
the
assumption
of
sensations
recurring
in
immutable
shape
is
so
easily
shown
to
be
baseless
how
much
more
baseless
is
the
assumption
of
immutability
in
the
larger
masses
of
our
thought
for
there
it
is
obvious
and
palpable
that
our
state
of
mind
is
never
precisely
the
same
every
thought
we
have
of
a
given
fact
is
strictly
speaking
unique
and
only
bears
a
resemblance
of
kind
with
our
other
thoughts
of
the
same
fact
when
the
identical
fact
recurs
we
think
of
it
in
a
fresh
manner
see
it
under
a
somewhat
different
angle
apprehend
it
in
different
relations
from
those
in
which
it
last
appeared
and
the
thought
by
which
we
cognize
it
is
the
thought
of
a
thought
suffused
with
the
consciousness
of
all
that
dim
context
often
we
are
ourselves
struck
at
the
strange
differences
in
our
successive
views
of
the
same
thing
we
wonder
how
we
ever
could
have
opined
as
we
did
last
month
about
a
certain
matter
we
have
outgrown
the
possibility
of
that
state
of
mind
we
know
not
how
from
one
year
to
another
we
see
things
in
new
lights
what
was
unreal
has
grown
real
and
what
was
exciting
is
insipid
the
friends
we
used
to
care
the
world
for
are
shrunken
to
shadows
the
women
once
so
divine
the
stars
the
woods
and
the
waters
how
now
so
dull
and
common
the
young
girls
that
brought
an
aura
of
infinity
at
present
hardly
distinguishable
existences
the
pictures
so
empty
and
as
for
the
books
what
there
to
find
so
mysteriously
significant
in
goethe
or
in
john
mill
so
full
of
weight
instead
of
all
this
more
zestful
than
ever
is
the
work
and
fuller
and
deeper
the
import
of
common
duties
and
of
common
goods
i
am
sure
that
this
concrete
and
total
manner
of
regarding
the
changes
is
the
only
true
manner
difficult
as
it
may
be
to
carry
it
out
in
detail
if
anything
seems
obscure
about
it
it
will
grow
clearer
as
we
advance
meanwhile
if
it
be
true
it
is
certainly
also
true
that
no
two
are
ever
exactly
the
same
which
is
the
proposition
we
started
to
prove
the
proposition
is
more
important
theoretically
than
it
at
first
sight
seems
for
it
makes
it
already
impossible
for
us
to
follow
obediently
in
the
footprints
of
either
the
lockian
or
the
herbartian
school
schools
which
have
had
almost
unlimited
influence
in
germany
and
among
ourselves
no
doubt
it
is
often
to
formulate
the
mental
facts
in
an
atomistic
sort
of
way
and
to
treat
the
higher
states
of
consciousness
as
if
they
were
all
built
out
of
unchanging
simple
ideas
which
and
turn
again
it
is
convenient
often
to
treat
curves
as
if
they
were
composed
of
small
straight
lines
and
electricity
and
as
if
they
were
fluids
but
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
we
must
never
forget
that
we
are
talking
symbolically
and
that
there
is
nothing
in
nature
to
answer
to
our
words
permanently
existing
which
makes
its
appearance
before
the
footlights
of
consciousness
at
periodical
intervals
is
as
mythological
an
entity
as
the
jack
of
each
personal
consciousness
thought
is
sensibly
i
can
only
define
as
that
which
is
without
breach
crack
or
division
the
only
breaches
that
can
well
be
conceived
to
occur
within
the
limits
of
a
single
mind
would
either
be
during
which
the
consciousness
went
out
or
they
would
be
breaks
in
the
content
of
the
thought
so
abrupt
that
what
followed
had
no
connection
whatever
with
what
went
before
the
proposition
that
consciousness
feels
continuous
means
two
things
that
even
where
there
is
a
the
consciousness
after
it
feels
as
if
it
belonged
together
with
the
consciousness
before
it
as
another
part
of
the
same
self
that
the
changes
from
one
moment
to
another
in
the
quality
of
the
consciousness
are
never
absolutely
abrupt
the
case
of
the
as
the
simplest
shall
be
taken
first
when
paul
and
peter
wake
up
in
the
same
bed
and
recognize
that
they
have
been
asleep
each
one
of
them
mentally
reaches
back
and
makes
connection
with
but
of
the
two
streams
of
thought
which
were
broken
by
the
sleeping
hours
as
the
current
of
an
electrode
buried
in
the
ground
unerringly
finds
its
way
to
its
own
similarly
buried
mate
across
no
matter
how
much
intervening
earth
so
peter
present
instantly
finds
out
peter
past
and
never
by
mistake
knits
itself
on
to
that
of
paul
paul
thought
in
turn
is
as
little
liable
to
go
astray
the
past
thought
of
peter
is
appropriated
by
the
present
peter
alone
he
may
have
a
and
a
correct
one
too
of
what
last
drowsy
states
of
mind
were
as
he
sank
into
sleep
but
it
is
an
entirely
different
sort
of
knowledge
from
that
which
he
has
of
his
own
last
states
he
his
own
states
whilst
he
only
paul
remembrance
is
like
direct
feeling
its
object
is
suffused
with
a
warmth
and
intimacy
to
which
no
object
of
mere
conception
ever
attains
this
quality
of
warmth
and
intimacy
and
immediacy
is
what
peter
thought
also
possesses
for
itself
so
sure
as
this
present
is
me
is
mine
it
says
so
sure
is
anything
else
that
comes
with
the
same
warmth
and
intimacy
and
immediacy
me
and
mine
what
the
qualities
called
warmth
and
intimacy
may
in
themselves
be
will
have
to
be
matter
for
future
consideration
but
whatever
past
states
appear
with
those
qualities
must
be
admitted
to
receive
the
greeting
of
the
present
mental
state
to
be
owned
by
it
and
accepted
as
belonging
together
with
it
in
a
common
self
this
community
of
self
is
what
the
can
not
break
in
twain
and
is
why
a
present
thought
although
not
ignorant
of
the
can
still
regard
itself
as
continuous
with
certain
chosen
portions
of
the
past
consciousness
then
does
not
appear
to
itself
chopped
up
in
bits
such
words
as
or
do
not
describe
it
fitly
as
it
presents
itself
in
the
first
instance
it
is
nothing
jointed
it
flows
a
or
a
are
the
metaphors
by
which
it
is
most
naturally
described
talking
of
it
hereafter
let
us
call
it
the
stream
of
thought
of
consciousness
or
of
subjective
but
now
there
appears
even
within
the
limits
of
the
same
self
and
between
thoughts
all
of
which
alike
have
this
same
sense
of
belonging
together
a
kind
of
jointing
and
separateness
among
the
parts
of
which
this
statement
seems
to
take
no
account
i
refer
to
the
breaks
that
are
produced
by
sudden
in
the
of
the
successive
segments
of
the
stream
of
thought
if
the
words
and
had
no
natural
fitness
in
them
how
came
such
words
to
be
used
at
all
does
not
a
loud
explosion
rend
the
consciousness
upon
which
it
abruptly
breaks
in
twain
no
for
even
into
our
awareness
of
the
thunder
the
awareness
of
the
previous
silence
creeps
and
continues
for
what
we
hear
when
the
thunder
crashes
is
not
thunder
but
our
feeling
of
the
same
objective
thunder
coming
in
this
way
is
quite
different
from
what
it
would
be
were
the
thunder
a
continuation
of
previous
thunder
the
thunder
itself
we
believe
to
abolish
and
exclude
the
silence
but
the
of
the
thunder
is
also
a
feeling
of
the
silence
as
just
gone
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
in
the
actual
concrete
consciousness
of
man
a
feeling
so
limited
to
the
present
as
not
to
have
an
inkling
of
anything
that
went
before
and
states
of
when
we
take
a
general
view
of
the
wonderful
stream
of
our
consciousness
what
strikes
us
first
is
the
different
pace
of
its
parts
like
a
bird
life
it
seems
to
be
an
alternation
of
flights
and
perchings
the
rhythm
of
language
expresses
this
where
every
thought
is
expressed
in
a
sentence
and
every
sentence
closed
by
a
period
the
are
usually
occupied
by
sensorial
imaginations
of
some
sort
whose
peculiarity
is
that
they
can
be
held
before
the
mind
for
an
indefinite
time
and
contemplated
without
changing
the
places
of
flight
are
filled
with
thoughts
of
relations
static
or
dynamic
that
for
the
most
part
obtain
between
the
matters
contemplated
in
the
periods
of
comparative
rest
us
call
the
the
parts
and
the
places
of
flight
the
parts
of
the
stream
of
it
then
appears
that
our
thinking
tends
at
all
times
towards
some
other
substantive
part
than
the
one
from
which
it
has
just
been
dislodged
and
we
may
say
that
the
main
use
of
the
transitive
parts
is
to
lead
us
from
one
substantive
conclusion
to
another
now
it
is
very
difficult
introspectively
to
see
the
transitive
parts
for
what
they
really
are
if
they
are
but
flights
to
a
conclusion
stopping
them
to
look
at
them
before
the
conclusion
is
reached
is
really
annihilating
them
whilst
if
we
wait
till
the
conclusion
reached
it
so
exceeds
them
in
vigor
and
stability
that
it
quite
eclipses
and
swallows
them
up
in
its
glare
let
anyone
try
to
cut
a
thought
across
in
the
middle
and
get
a
look
at
its
section
and
he
will
see
how
difficult
the
introspective
observation
of
the
transitive
tracts
is
the
rush
of
the
thought
is
so
headlong
that
it
almost
always
brings
us
up
at
the
conclusion
before
we
can
arrest
it
or
if
our
purpose
is
nimble
enough
and
we
do
arrest
it
it
ceases
forthwith
to
be
itself
as
a
snowflake
crystal
caught
in
the
warm
hand
is
no
longer
a
crystal
but
a
drop
so
instead
of
catching
the
feeling
of
relation
moving
to
its
term
we
find
we
have
caught
some
substantive
thing
usually
the
last
word
we
were
pronouncing
statically
taken
and
with
its
function
tendency
and
particular
meaning
in
the
sentence
quite
evaporated
the
attempt
at
introspective
analysis
in
these
cases
is
in
fact
like
seizing
a
spinning
top
to
catch
its
motion
or
trying
to
turn
up
the
gas
quickly
enough
to
see
how
the
darkness
looks
and
the
challenge
to
these
transitive
states
of
consciousness
which
is
sure
to
be
thrown
by
doubting
psychologists
at
anyone
who
contends
for
their
existence
is
as
unfair
as
zeno
treatment
of
the
advocates
of
motion
when
asking
them
to
point
out
in
what
place
an
arrow
is
when
it
moves
he
argues
the
falsity
of
their
thesis
from
their
inability
to
make
to
so
preposterous
a
question
an
immediate
reply
the
results
of
this
introspective
difficulty
are
baleful
if
to
hold
fast
and
observe
the
transitive
parts
of
thought
stream
be
so
hard
then
the
great
blunder
to
which
all
schools
are
liable
must
be
the
failure
to
register
them
and
the
undue
emphasizing
of
the
more
substantive
parts
of
the
stream
now
the
blunder
has
historically
worked
in
two
ways
one
set
of
thinkers
have
been
led
by
it
to
unable
to
lay
their
hands
on
any
substantive
feelings
corresponding
to
the
innumerable
relations
and
forms
of
connection
between
the
sensible
things
of
the
world
finding
no
mental
states
mirroring
such
relations
they
have
for
the
most
part
denied
that
any
such
states
exist
and
many
of
them
like
hume
have
gone
on
to
deny
the
reality
of
most
relations
of
the
mind
as
well
as
in
it
simple
substantive
sensations
and
their
copies
juxtaposed
like
dominoes
in
a
game
but
really
separate
everything
else
verbal
illusion
such
is
the
upshot
of
this
view
the
on
the
other
hand
unable
to
give
up
the
reality
of
relations
but
equally
unable
to
point
to
any
distinct
substantive
feelings
in
which
they
were
known
have
made
the
same
admission
that
such
feelings
do
not
exist
but
they
have
drawn
an
opposite
conclusion
the
relations
must
be
known
they
say
in
something
that
is
no
feeling
no
mental
continuous
and
consubstantial
with
the
subjective
tissue
out
of
which
sensations
and
other
substantive
conditions
of
consciousness
are
made
they
must
be
known
by
something
that
lies
on
an
entirely
different
plane
by
an
of
thought
intellect
or
reason
all
written
with
capitals
and
considered
to
mean
something
unutterably
superior
to
any
passing
perishing
fact
of
sensibility
whatever
but
from
our
point
of
view
both
intellectualists
and
sensationalists
are
wrong
if
there
be
such
things
as
feelings
at
all
so
surely
as
relations
between
objects
in
rerum
naturÃ¢
surely
and
more
surely
do
feelings
exist
to
which
these
relations
are
there
is
not
a
conjunction
or
a
preposition
and
hardly
an
adverbial
phrase
syntactic
form
or
inflection
of
voice
in
human
speech
that
does
not
express
some
shading
or
other
of
relation
which
we
at
some
moment
actually
feel
to
exist
between
the
larger
objects
of
our
thought
if
we
speak
objectively
it
is
the
real
relations
that
appear
revealed
if
we
speak
subjectively
it
is
the
stream
of
consciousness
that
matches
each
of
them
by
an
inward
coloring
of
its
own
in
either
case
the
relations
are
numberless
and
no
existing
language
is
capable
of
doing
justice
to
all
their
shades
we
ought
to
say
a
feeling
of
a
feeling
of
a
feeling
of
and
a
feeling
of
quite
as
readily
as
we
say
a
feeling
of
or
a
feeling
of
yet
we
do
not
so
inveterate
has
our
habit
become
of
recognizing
the
existence
of
the
substantive
parts
alone
that
language
almost
refuses
to
lend
itself
to
any
other
use
consider
once
again
the
analogy
of
the
brain
we
believe
the
brain
to
be
an
organ
whose
internal
equilibrium
is
always
in
a
state
of
change
the
change
affecting
every
part
the
pulses
of
change
are
doubtless
more
violent
in
one
place
than
in
another
their
rhythm
more
rapid
at
this
time
than
at
that
as
in
a
kaleidoscope
revolving
at
a
uniform
rate
although
the
figures
are
always
rearranging
themselves
there
are
instants
during
which
the
transformation
seems
minute
and
interstitial
and
almost
absent
followed
by
others
when
it
shoots
with
magical
rapidity
relatively
stable
forms
thus
alternating
with
forms
we
should
not
distinguish
if
seen
again
so
in
the
brain
the
perpetual
rearrangement
must
result
in
some
forms
of
tension
lingering
relatively
long
whilst
others
simply
come
and
pass
but
if
consciousness
corresponds
to
the
fact
of
rearrangement
itself
why
if
the
rearrangement
stop
not
should
the
consciousness
ever
cease
and
if
a
lingering
rearrangement
brings
with
it
one
kind
of
consciousness
why
should
not
a
swift
rearrangement
bring
another
kind
of
consciousness
as
peculiar
as
the
rearrangement
itself
object
before
the
mind
always
has
a
there
are
other
unnamed
modifications
of
consciousness
just
as
important
as
the
transitive
states
and
just
as
cognitive
as
they
examples
will
show
what
i
mean
suppose
three
successive
persons
say
to
us
our
consciousness
is
thrown
into
three
quite
different
attitudes
of
expectancy
although
no
definite
object
is
before
it
in
any
one
of
the
three
cases
probably
no
one
will
deny
here
the
existence
of
a
real
conscious
affection
a
sense
of
the
direction
from
which
an
impression
is
about
to
come
although
no
positive
impression
is
yet
there
meanwhile
we
have
no
names
for
the
psychoses
in
question
but
the
names
hark
look
and
wait
suppose
we
try
to
recall
a
forgotten
name
the
state
of
our
consciousness
is
peculiar
there
is
a
gap
therein
but
no
mere
gap
it
is
a
gap
that
is
intensely
active
a
sort
of
wraith
of
the
name
is
in
it
beckoning
us
in
a
given
direction
making
us
at
moments
tingle
with
the
sense
of
our
closeness
and
then
letting
us
sink
back
without
the
term
if
wrong
names
are
proposed
to
us
this
singularly
definite
gap
acts
immediately
so
as
to
negate
them
they
do
not
fit
into
its
mould
and
the
gap
of
one
word
does
not
feel
like
the
gap
of
another
all
empty
of
content
as
both
might
seem
necessarily
to
be
when
described
as
gaps
when
i
vainly
try
to
recall
the
name
of
spalding
my
consciousness
is
far
removed
from
what
it
is
when
i
vainly
try
to
recall
the
name
of
bowles
there
are
innumerable
consciousnesses
of
no
one
of
which
taken
in
itself
has
a
name
but
all
different
from
each
other
such
a
feeling
of
want
is
other
than
a
want
of
feeling
it
is
an
intense
feeling
the
rhythm
of
a
lost
word
may
be
there
without
a
sound
to
clothe
it
or
the
evanescent
sense
of
something
which
is
the
initial
vowel
or
consonant
may
mock
us
fitfully
without
growing
more
distinct
every
one
must
know
the
tantalizing
effect
of
the
blank
rhythm
of
some
forgotten
verse
restlessly
dancing
in
one
mind
striving
to
be
filled
out
with
words
what
is
that
first
instantaneous
glimpse
of
some
one
meaning
which
we
have
when
in
vulgar
phrase
we
say
we
it
surely
an
altogether
specific
affection
of
our
mind
and
has
the
reader
never
asked
himself
what
kind
of
a
mental
fact
is
his
of
saying
a
before
he
has
said
it
it
is
an
entirely
definite
intention
distinct
from
all
other
intentions
an
absolutely
distinct
state
of
consciousness
therefore
and
yet
how
much
of
it
consists
of
definite
sensorial
images
either
of
words
or
of
things
hardly
anything
linger
and
the
words
and
things
come
into
the
mind
the
anticipatory
intention
the
divination
is
there
no
more
but
as
the
words
that
replace
it
arrive
it
welcomes
them
successively
and
calls
them
right
if
they
agree
with
it
it
rejects
them
and
calls
them
wrong
if
they
do
not
the
intention
is
the
only
name
it
can
receive
one
may
admit
that
a
good
third
of
our
psychic
life
consists
in
these
rapid
premonitory
perspective
views
of
schemes
of
thought
not
yet
articulate
how
comes
it
about
that
a
man
reading
something
aloud
for
the
first
time
is
able
immediately
to
emphasize
all
his
words
aright
unless
from
the
very
first
he
have
a
sense
of
at
least
the
form
of
the
sentence
yet
to
come
which
sense
is
fused
with
his
consciousness
of
the
present
word
and
modifies
its
emphasis
in
his
mind
so
as
to
make
him
give
it
the
proper
accent
as
he
utters
it
emphasis
of
this
kind
almost
altogether
depends
on
grammatical
construction
if
we
read
more
we
expect
presently
a
if
we
read
it
is
a
a
or
a
that
we
expect
and
this
foreboding
of
the
coming
verbal
and
grammatical
scheme
is
so
practically
accurate
that
a
reader
incapable
of
understanding
four
ideas
of
the
book
he
is
reading
aloud
can
nevertheless
read
it
with
the
most
delicately
modulated
expression
of
intelligence
it
is
the
reader
will
see
the
reinstatement
of
the
vague
and
inarticulate
to
its
proper
place
in
our
mental
life
which
i
am
so
anxious
to
press
on
the
attention
galton
and
huxley
have
as
we
shall
see
in
the
chapter
on
imagination
made
one
step
in
advance
in
exploding
the
ridiculous
theory
of
hume
and
berkeley
that
we
can
have
no
images
but
of
perfectly
definite
things
another
is
made
if
we
overthrow
the
equally
ridiculous
notion
that
whilst
simple
objective
qualities
are
revealed
to
our
knowledge
in
of
consciousness
relations
are
not
but
these
reforms
are
not
half
sweeping
and
radical
enough
what
must
be
admitted
is
that
the
definite
images
of
traditional
psychology
form
but
the
very
smallest
part
of
our
minds
as
they
actually
live
the
traditional
psychology
talks
like
one
who
should
say
a
river
consists
of
nothing
but
pailsful
spoonsful
quartpotsful
barrelsful
and
other
moulded
forms
of
water
even
were
the
pails
and
the
pots
all
actually
standing
in
the
stream
still
between
them
the
free
water
would
continue
to
flow
it
is
just
this
free
water
of
consciousness
that
psychologists
resolutely
overlook
every
definite
image
in
the
mind
is
steeped
and
dyed
in
the
free
water
that
flows
round
it
with
it
goes
the
sense
of
its
relations
near
and
remote
the
dying
echo
of
whence
it
came
to
us
the
dawning
sense
of
whither
it
is
to
lead
the
significance
the
value
of
the
image
is
all
in
this
halo
or
penumbra
that
surrounds
and
escorts
it
or
rather
that
is
fused
into
one
with
it
and
has
become
bone
of
its
bone
and
flesh
of
its
flesh
leaving
it
it
is
true
an
image
of
the
same
it
was
before
but
making
it
an
image
of
that
thing
newly
taken
and
freshly
understood
us
call
the
consciousness
of
this
halo
of
relations
around
the
image
by
the
name
of
overtone
or
conditions
of
the
nothing
is
easier
than
to
symbolize
these
facts
in
terms
of
just
as
the
echo
of
the
the
sense
of
the
starting
point
of
our
thought
is
probably
due
to
the
dying
excitement
of
processes
but
a
moment
since
vividly
aroused
so
the
sense
of
the
whither
the
foretaste
of
the
terminus
must
be
due
to
the
waxing
excitement
of
tracts
or
processes
whose
psychical
correlative
will
a
moment
hence
be
the
vividly
present
feature
of
our
thought
represented
by
a
curve
the
neurosis
underlying
consciousness
must
at
any
moment
be
like
this
illustration
fig
let
the
horizontal
in
fig
be
the
line
of
time
and
let
the
three
curves
beginning
at
and
respectively
stand
for
the
neural
processes
correlated
with
the
thoughts
of
those
three
letters
each
process
occupies
a
certain
time
during
which
its
intensity
waxes
culminates
and
wanes
the
process
for
has
not
yet
died
out
the
process
for
has
already
begun
when
that
for
is
culminating
at
the
represented
by
the
vertical
line
all
three
processes
are
in
the
intensities
shown
by
the
curve
those
before
apex
more
intense
a
moment
ago
those
after
it
more
intense
a
moment
hence
if
i
recite
then
at
the
moment
of
uttering
neither
nor
is
out
of
my
consciousness
altogether
but
both
after
their
respective
fashions
their
dim
lights
with
the
stronger
because
their
processes
are
both
awake
in
some
degree
it
is
just
like
in
music
they
are
not
separately
heard
by
the
ear
they
blend
with
the
fundamental
note
and
suffuse
it
and
alter
it
and
even
so
do
the
waxing
and
waning
at
every
moment
blend
with
and
suffuse
and
alter
the
psychic
effect
of
the
processes
which
are
at
their
culminating
point
of
the
if
we
then
consider
the
of
different
states
of
mind
we
may
feel
assured
that
the
difference
between
those
that
are
mere
and
those
that
are
is
reducible
almost
entirely
to
the
absence
or
presence
of
psychic
fringes
or
overtones
knowledge
a
thing
is
knowledge
of
its
relations
acquaintance
with
it
is
limitation
to
the
bare
impression
which
it
makes
of
most
of
its
relations
we
are
only
aware
in
the
penumbral
nascent
way
of
a
of
unarticulated
affinities
about
it
and
before
passing
to
the
next
topic
in
order
i
must
say
a
little
of
this
sense
of
affinity
as
itself
one
of
the
most
interesting
features
of
the
subjective
stream
may
be
equally
rational
in
any
sort
of
all
our
voluntary
thinking
there
is
topic
or
subject
about
which
all
the
members
of
the
thought
revolve
relation
to
this
topic
or
interest
is
constantly
felt
in
the
fringe
and
particularly
the
relation
of
harmony
and
discord
of
furtherance
or
hindrance
of
the
topic
any
thought
the
quality
of
whose
fringe
lets
us
feel
ourselves
right
may
be
considered
a
thought
that
furthers
the
topic
provided
we
only
feel
its
object
to
have
a
place
in
the
scheme
of
relations
in
which
the
topic
also
lies
that
is
sufficient
to
make
of
it
a
relevant
and
appropriate
portion
of
our
train
of
ideas
now
we
may
think
about
our
topic
mainly
in
words
or
we
may
think
about
it
mainly
in
visual
or
other
images
but
this
need
make
no
difference
as
regards
the
furtherance
of
our
knowledge
of
the
topic
if
we
only
feel
in
the
terms
whatever
they
be
a
fringe
of
affinity
with
each
other
and
with
the
topic
and
if
we
are
conscious
of
approaching
a
conclusion
we
feel
that
our
thought
is
rational
and
right
the
words
in
every
language
have
contracted
by
long
association
fringes
of
mutual
repugnance
or
affinity
with
each
other
and
with
the
conclusion
which
run
exactly
parallel
with
like
fringes
in
the
visual
tactile
and
other
ideas
the
most
important
element
of
these
fringes
is
i
repeat
the
mere
feeling
of
harmony
or
discord
of
a
right
or
wrong
direction
in
the
thought
if
we
know
english
and
french
and
begin
a
sentence
in
french
all
the
later
words
that
come
are
french
we
hardly
ever
drop
into
english
and
this
affinity
of
the
french
words
for
each
other
is
not
something
merely
operating
mechanically
as
a
it
is
something
we
feel
at
the
time
our
understanding
of
a
french
sentence
heard
never
falls
to
so
low
an
ebb
that
we
are
not
aware
that
the
words
linguistically
belong
together
our
attention
can
hardly
so
wander
that
if
an
english
word
be
suddenly
introduced
we
shall
not
start
at
the
change
such
a
vague
sense
as
this
of
the
words
belonging
together
is
the
very
minimum
of
fringe
that
can
accompany
them
if
at
all
usually
the
vague
perception
that
all
the
words
we
hear
belong
to
the
same
language
and
to
the
same
special
vocabulary
in
that
language
and
that
the
grammatical
sequence
is
familiar
is
practically
equivalent
to
an
admission
that
what
we
hear
is
sense
but
if
an
unusual
foreign
word
be
introduced
if
the
grammar
trip
or
if
a
term
from
an
incongruous
vocabulary
suddenly
appear
such
as
or
bill
in
a
philosophical
discourse
the
sentence
detonates
as
it
were
we
receive
a
shock
from
the
incongruity
and
the
drowsy
assent
is
gone
the
feeling
of
rationality
in
these
cases
seems
rather
a
negative
than
a
positive
thing
being
the
mere
absence
of
shock
or
sense
of
discord
between
the
terms
of
thought
conversely
if
words
do
belong
to
the
same
vocabulary
and
if
the
grammatical
structure
is
correct
sentences
with
absolutely
no
meaning
may
be
uttered
in
good
faith
and
pass
unchallenged
discourses
at
the
same
collection
of
cant
phrases
and
the
whole
genus
of
and
flourishes
give
illustrations
of
this
the
birds
filled
the
with
their
morning
song
making
the
air
moist
cool
and
pleasant

a
sentence
i
remember
reading
once
in
a
report
of
some
athletic
exercises
in
jerome
park
it
was
probably
written
unconsciously
by
the
hurried
reporter
and
read
uncritically
by
many
readers
illustration
fig
we
see
then
that
it
makes
little
or
no
difference
in
what
sort
of
in
what
quality
of
imagery
our
thinking
goes
on
the
only
images
important
are
the
the
substantive
conclusions
provisional
or
final
of
the
thought
throughout
all
the
rest
of
the
stream
the
feelings
of
relation
are
everything
and
the
terms
related
almost
naught
these
feelings
of
relation
these
psychic
overtones
halos
suffusions
or
fringes
about
the
terms
may
be
the
same
in
very
different
systems
of
imagery
a
diagram
may
help
to
accentuate
this
indifference
of
the
mental
means
where
the
end
is
the
same
let
be
some
experience
from
which
a
number
of
thinkers
start
let
be
the
practical
conclusion
rationally
inferrible
from
it

gets
to
this
conclusion

trains
are
tinged
with
emotions
others
not
some
are
very
abridged
synthetic
and
rapid
others
hesitating
and
broken
into
many
steps
but
when
the
penultimate
terms
of
all
the
trains
however
differing
finally
shoot
into
the
same
conclusion
we
say
and
rightly
say
that
all
the
thinkers
have
had
substantially
the
same
thought
it
would
probably
astound
each
of
them
beyond
measure
to
be
let
into
his
neighbor
mind
and
to
find
how
different
the
scenery
there
was
from
that
in
his
own
the
last
peculiarity
to
which
attention
is
to
be
drawn
in
this
first
rough
description
of
thought
stream
is
that
is
always
interested
more
in
one
part
of
its
object
than
in
another
and
welcomes
and
rejects
or
chooses
all
the
while
it
the
phenomena
of
selective
attention
and
of
deliberative
will
are
of
course
patent
examples
of
this
choosing
activity
but
few
of
us
are
aware
how
incessantly
it
is
at
work
in
operations
not
ordinarily
called
by
these
names
accentuation
and
emphasis
are
present
in
every
perception
we
have
we
find
it
quite
impossible
to
disperse
our
attention
impartially
over
a
number
of
impressions
a
monotonous
succession
of
sonorous
strokes
is
broken
up
into
rhythms
now
of
one
sort
now
of
another
by
the
different
accent
which
we
place
on
different
strokes
the
simplest
of
these
rhythms
is
the
double
one
dots
dispersed
on
a
surface
are
perceived
in
rows
and
groups
lines
separate
into
diverse
figures
the
ubiquity
of
the
distinctions
and
and
and
in
our
minds
is
the
result
of
our
laying
the
same
selective
emphasis
on
parts
of
place
and
time
but
we
do
far
more
than
emphasize
things
and
unite
some
and
keep
others
apart
we
actually
most
of
the
things
before
us
let
me
briefly
show
how
this
goes
on
to
begin
at
the
bottom
what
are
our
very
senses
themselves
as
we
saw
on
pp
but
organs
of
selection
out
of
the
infinite
chaos
of
movements
of
which
physics
teaches
us
that
the
outer
world
consists
each
picks
out
those
which
fall
within
certain
limits
of
velocity
to
these
it
responds
but
ignores
the
rest
as
completely
as
if
they
did
not
exist
out
of
what
is
in
itself
an
undistinguishable
swarming
devoid
of
distinction
or
emphasis
our
senses
make
for
us
by
attending
to
this
motion
and
ignoring
that
a
world
full
of
contrasts
of
sharp
accents
of
abrupt
changes
of
picturesque
light
and
shade
if
the
sensations
we
receive
from
a

attention
on
the

out
of
all
the
sensations
yielded
picks
out
certain
ones
as
worthy
of
its
notice
and
suppresses
all
the

we
notice
only
those
sensations
which
are
signs
to
us
of
which
happen
practically
or
Ã¦sthetically
to
interest
us
to
which
we
therefore
give
substantive
names
and
which
we
exalt
to
this
exclusive
status
of
independence
and
dignity
but
in
itself
apart
from
my
interest
a
particular
on
a
windy
day
is
just
as
much
of
an
individual
and
just
as
much
or
as
little
deserves
an
individual
name
as
my
own
body
does
and
then
among
the
sensations
we
get
from
each
separate
thing
what
happens
the
mind
selects
again
it
chooses
certain
of
the
sensations
to
represent
the
thing
most
and
considers
the
rest
as
its
appearances
modified
by
the
conditions
of
the
moment
thus
my
is
named
after
but
one
of
an
infinite
number
of
retinal
sensations
which
it
yields
the
rest
of
them
being
sensations
of
two
acute
and
two
obtuse
angles
but
i
call
the
latter
views
and
the
four

for
Ã¦sthetic
reasons
of
my

in
like
manner
the
real
form
of
the
circle
is
deemed
to
be
the
sensation
it
gives
when
the
line
of
vision
is
perpendicular
to
its
centre
all
its
other
sensations
are
of
this
sensation
the
real
sound
of
the
cannon
is
the
sensation
it
makes
when
the
ear
is
close
by
the
real
color
of
the
brick
is
the
sensation
it
gives
when
the
eye
looks
squarely
at
it
from
a
near
point
out
of
the
sunshine
and
yet
not
in
the
gloom
under
other
circumstances
it
gives
us
other
which
are
but
signs
of
this
we
then
see
it
looks
pinker
or
bluer
than
it
really
is
the
reader
knows
no
object
which
he
does
not
represent
to
himself
by
preference
as
in
some
typical
attitude
of
some
normal
size
at
some
characteristic
distance
of
some
standard
tint
etc
but
all
these
essential
characteristics
which
together
form
for
us
the
genuine
objectivity
of
the
thing
and
are
contrasted
with
what
we
call
the
subjective
sensations
it
may
yield
us
at
a
given
moment
are
mere
sensations
like
the
latter
the
mind
chooses
to
suit
itself
and
decides
what
particular
sensation
shall
be
held
more
real
and
valid
than
all
the
rest
next
in
a
world
of
objects
thus
individualized
by
our
mind
selective
industry
what
is
called
our
is
almost
entirely
determined
by
our
habits
of
attention
a
thing
may
be
present
to
a
man
a
hundred
times
but
if
he
persistently
fails
to
notice
it
it
can
not
be
said
to
enter
into
his
experience
we
are
all
seeing
flies
moths
and
beetles
by
the
thousand
but
to
whom
save
an
entomologist
do
they
say
anything
distinct
on
the
other
hand
a
thing
met
only
once
in
a
lifetime
may
leave
an
indelible
experience
in
the
memory
let
four
men
make
a
tour
in
europe
one
will
bring
home
only
picturesque
impressions
costumes
and
colors
parks
and
views
and
works
of
architecture
pictures
and
statues
to
another
all
this
will
be
and
distances
and
prices
populations
and
and
other
useful
statistics
will
take
their
place
a
third
will
give
a
rich
account
of
the
theatres
restaurants
and
public
halls
and
naught
beside
whilst
the
fourth
will
perhaps
have
been
so
wrapped
in
his
own
subjective
broodings
as
to
be
able
to
tell
little
more
than
a
few
names
of
places
through
which
he
passed
each
has
selected
out
of
the
same
mass
of
presented
objects
those
which
suited
his
private
interest
and
has
made
his
experience
thereby
if
now
leaving
the
empirical
combination
of
objects
we
ask
how
the
mind
proceeds
to
connect
them
we
find
selection
again
to
be
omnipotent
in
a
future
chapter
we
shall
see
that
all
reasoning
depends
on
the
ability
of
the
mind
to
break
up
the
totality
of
the
phenomenon
reasoned
about
into
parts
and
to
pick
out
from
among
these
the
particular
one
which
in
the
given
emergency
may
lead
to
the
proper
conclusion
the
man
of
genius
is
he
who
will
always
stick
in
his
bill
at
the
right
point
and
bring
it
out
with
the
right
element
if
the
emergency
be
theoretical
if
it
be
practical
transfixed
upon
it
if
now
we
pass
to
the
Ã¦sthetic
department
our
law
is
still
more
obvious
the
artist
notoriously
selects
his
items
rejecting
all
tones
colors
shapes
which
do
not
harmonize
with
each
other
and
with
the
main
purpose
of
his
work
that
unity
harmony
of
characters
as
taine
calls
it
which
gives
to
works
of
art
their
superiority
over
works
of
nature
is
wholly
due
to
any
natural
subject
will
do
if
the
artist
has
wit
enough
to
pounce
upon
some
one
feature
of
it
as
characteristic
and
suppress
all
merely
accidental
items
which
do
not
harmonize
with
this
ascending
still
higher
we
reach
the
plane
of
ethics
where
choice
reigns
notoriously
supreme
an
act
has
no
ethical
quality
whatever
unless
it
be
chosen
out
of
several
all
equally
possible
to
sustain
the
arguments
for
the
good
course
and
keep
them
ever
before
us
to
stifle
our
longing
for
more
flowery
ways
to
keep
the
foot
unflinchingly
on
the
arduous
path
these
are
characteristic
ethical
energies
but
more
than
these
for
these
but
deal
with
the
means
of
compassing
interests
already
felt
by
the
man
to
be
supreme
the
ethical
energy
has
to
go
farther
and
choose
which
out
of
several
equally
coercive
shall
become
supreme
the
issue
here
is
of
the
utmost
pregnancy
for
it
decides
a
man
entire
career
when
he
debates
shall
i
commit
this
crime
choose
that
profession
accept
that
office
or
marry
this
fortune
his
choice
really
lies
between
one
of
several
equally
possible
future
characters
what
he
shall
is
fixed
by
the
conduct
of
this
moment
schopenhauer
who
enforces
his
determinism
by
the
argument
that
with
a
given
fixed
character
only
one
reaction
is
possible
under
given
circumstances
forgets
that
in
these
critical
ethical
moments
what
consciously
to
be
in
question
is
the
complexion
of
the
character
itself
the
problem
with
the
man
is
less
what
act
he
shall
now
resolve
to
do
than
what
being
he
shall
now
choose
to
become
taking
human
experience
in
a
general
way
the
choosings
of
different
men
are
to
a
great
extent
the
same
the
race
as
a
whole
largely
agrees
as
to
what
it
shall
notice
and
name
and
among
the
noticed
parts
we
select
in
much
the
same
way
for
accentuation
and
preference
or
subordination
and
dislike
there
is
however
one
entirely
extraordinary
case
in
which
no
two
men
ever
are
known
to
choose
alike
one
great
splitting
of
the
whole
universe
into
two
halves
is
made
by
each
of
us
and
for
each
of
us
almost
all
of
the
interest
attaches
to
one
of
the
halves
but
we
all
draw
the
line
of
division
between
them
in
a
different
place
when
i
say
that
we
all
call
the
two
halves
by
the
same
names
and
that
those
names
are
and
respectively
it
will
at
once
be
seen
what
i
mean
the
altogether
unique
kind
of
interest
which
each
human
mind
feels
in
those
parts
of
creation
which
it
can
call
or
may
be
a
moral
riddle
but
it
is
a
fundamental
psychological
fact
no
mind
can
take
the
same
interest
in
his
neighbor
as
in
his
own
the
neighbor
me
falls
together
with
all
the
rest
of
things
in
one
foreign
mass
against
which
his
own
stands
out
in
startling
relief
even
the
trodden
worm
as
lotze
somewhere
says
contrasts
his
own
suffering
self
with
the
whole
remaining
universe
though
he
have
no
clear
conception
either
of
himself
or
of
what
the
universe
may
be
he
is
for
me
a
mere
part
of
the
world
for
him
it
is
i
who
am
the
mere
part
each
of
us
dichotomizes
the
kosmos
in
a
different
place
descending
now
to
finer
work
than
this
first
general
sketch
let
us
in
the
next
chapter
try
to
trace
the
psychology
of
this
fact
of
to
which
we
have
thus
once
more
been
led
chapter
xii
the
self
me
and
the
whatever
i
may
be
thinking
of
i
am
always
at
the
same
time
more
or
less
aware
of
of
my
at
the
same
time
it
is
who
am
aware
so
that
the
total
self
of
me
being
as
it
were
duplex
partly
known
and
partly
knower
partly
object
and
partly
subject
must
have
two
aspects
discriminated
in
it
of
which
for
shortness
we
may
call
one
the
and
the
other
the
i
call
these
aspects
and
not
separate
things
because
the
identity
of
with
even
in
the
very
act
of
their
discrimination
is
perhaps
the
most
ineradicable
dictum
of
and
must
not
be
undermined
by
our
terminology
here
at
the
outset
whatever
we
may
come
to
think
of
its
validity
at
our
inquiry
end
i
shall
therefore
treat
successively
of
a
the
self
as
known
or
the
the
ego
as
it
is
sometimes
called
and
of
b
the
self
as
knower
or
the
i
the
ego
of
certain
authors
a
the
self
as
known
empirical
self
or
between
what
a
man
calls
and
what
he
simply
calls
the
line
is
difficult
to
draw
we
feel
and
act
about
certain
things
that
are
ours
very
much
as
we
feel
and
act
about
ourselves
our
fame
our
children
the
work
of
our
hands
may
be
as
dear
to
us
as
our
bodies
are
and
arouse
the
same
feelings
and
the
same
acts
of
reprisal
if
attacked
and
our
bodies
themselves
are
they
simply
ours
or
are
they
certainly
men
have
been
ready
to
disown
their
very
bodies
and
to
regard
them
as
mere
vestures
or
even
as
prisons
of
clay
from
which
they
should
some
day
be
glad
to
escape
we
see
then
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
fluctuating
material
the
same
object
being
sometimes
treated
as
a
part
of
me
at
other
times
as
simply
mine
and
then
again
as
if
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
all
its
widest
possible
however
man
me
is
the
sum
total
of
all
that
can
not
only
his
body
and
his
psychic
powers
but
his
clothes
and
his
house
his
wife
and
children
his
ancestors
and
friends
his
reputation
and
works
his
lands
and
horses
and
yacht
and
all
these
things
give
him
the
same
emotions
if
they
wax
and
prosper
he
feels
triumphant
if
they
dwindle
and
die
away
he
feels
cast
down
not
necessarily
in
the
same
degree
for
each
thing
but
in
much
the
same
way
for
all
understanding
the
me
in
this
widest
sense
we
may
begin
by
dividing
the
history
of
it
into
three
parts
relating
respectively
to
its
constituents
the
feelings
and
emotions
they
arouse
the
act
to
which
they
prompt
and
constituents
of
the
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
those
which
make
up
respectively
the
material
me
the
social
me
and
the
spiritual
me
material
the
is
the
innermost
part
of
the
material
me
in
each
of
us
and
certain
parts
of
the
body
seem
more
intimately
ours
than
the
rest
the
clothes
come
next
the
old
saying
that
the
human
person
is
composed
of
three
parts
soul
body
and
clothes
is
more
than
a
joke
we
so
appropriate
our
clothes
and
identify
ourselves
with
them
that
there
are
few
of
us
who
if
asked
to
choose
between
having
a
beautiful
body
clad
in
raiment
perpetually
shabby
and
unclean
and
having
an
ugly
and
blemished
form
always
spotlessly
attired
would
not
hesitate
a
moment
before
making
a
decisive
reply
next
our
immediate
family
is
a
part
of
ourselves
our
father
and
mother
our
wife
and
babes
are
bone
of
our
bone
and
flesh
of
our
flesh
when
they
die
a
part
of
our
very
selves
is
gone
if
they
do
anything
wrong
it
is
our
shame
if
they
are
insulted
our
anger
flashes
forth
as
readily
as
if
we
stood
in
their
place
our
home
comes
next
its
scenes
are
part
of
our
life
its
aspects
awaken
the
tenderest
feelings
of
affection
and
we
do
not
easily
forgive
the
stranger
who
in
visiting
it
finds
fault
with
its
arrangements
or
treats
it
with
contempt
all
these
different
things
are
the
objects
of
instinctive
preferences
coupled
with
the
most
important
practical
interests
of
life
we
all
have
a
blind
impulse
to
watch
over
our
body
to
deck
it
with
clothing
of
an
ornamental
sort
to
cherish
parents
wife
and
babes
and
to
find
for
ourselves
a
house
of
our
own
which
we
may
live
in
and
an
equally
instinctive
impulse
drives
us
to
collect
property
and
the
collections
thus
made
become
with
different
degrees
of
intimacy
parts
of
our
empirical
selves
the
parts
of
our
wealth
most
intimately
ours
are
those
which
are
saturated
with
our
labor
there
are
few
men
who
would
not
feel
personally
annihilated
if
a
construction
of
their
hands
or
brains
say
an
entomological
collection
or
an
extensive
work
in
manuscript
were
suddenly
swept
away
the
miser
feels
similarly
towards
his
gold
and
although
it
is
true
that
a
part
of
our
depression
at
the
loss
of
possessions
is
due
to
our
feeling
that
we
must
now
go
without
certain
goods
that
we
expected
the
possessions
to
bring
in
their
train
yet
in
every
case
there
remains
over
and
above
this
a
sense
of
the
shrinkage
of
our
personality
a
partial
conversion
of
ourselves
to
nothingness
which
is
a
psychological
phenomenon
by
itself
we
are
all
at
once
assimilated
to
the
tramps
and
poor
devils
whom
we
so
despise
and
at
the
same
time
removed
farther
than
ever
away
from
the
happy
sons
of
earth
who
lord
it
over
land
and
sea
and
men
in
the
lustihood
that
wealth
and
power
can
give
and
before
whom
stiffen
ourselves
as
we
will
by
appealing
to
first
principles
we
can
not
escape
an
emotion
open
or
sneaking
of
respect
and
dread
social
a
man
social
me
is
the
recognition
which
he
gets
from
his
mates
we
are
not
only
gregarious
animals
liking
to
be
in
sight
of
our
fellows
but
we
have
an
innate
propensity
to
get
ourselves
noticed
and
noticed
favorably
by
our
kind
no
more
fiendish
punishment
could
be
devised
were
such
a
thing
physically
possible
than
that
one
should
be
turned
loose
in
society
and
remain
absolutely
unnoticed
by
all
the
members
thereof
if
no
one
turned
round
when
we
entered
answered
when
we
spoke
or
minded
what
we
did
but
if
every
person
we
met
us
dead
and
acted
as
if
we
were
things
a
kind
of
rage
and
impotent
despair
would
ere
long
well
up
in
us
from
which
the
cruellest
bodily
tortures
would
be
a
relief
for
these
would
make
us
feel
that
however
bad
might
be
our
plight
we
had
not
sunk
to
such
a
depth
as
to
be
unworthy
of
attention
at
all
properly
speaking
man
has
as
many
social
selves
as
there
are
individuals
who
recognize
and
carry
an
image
of
him
in
their
mind
to
wound
any
one
of
these
his
images
is
to
wound
him
but
as
the
individuals
who
carry
the
images
fall
naturally
into
classes
we
may
practically
say
that
he
has
as
many
different
social
selves
as
there
are
distinct
of
persons
about
whose
opinion
he
cares
he
generally
shows
a
different
side
of
himself
to
each
of
these
different
groups
many
a
youth
who
is
demure
enough
before
his
parents
and
teachers
swears
and
swaggers
like
a
pirate
among
his
young
friends
we
do
not
show
ourselves
to
our
children
as
to
our
to
our
customers
as
to
the
laborers
we
employ
to
our
own
masters
and
employers
as
to
our
intimate
friends
from
this
there
results
what
practically
is
a
division
of
the
man
into
several
selves
and
this
may
be
a
discordant
splitting
as
where
one
is
afraid
to
let
one
set
of
his
acquaintances
know
him
as
he
is
elsewhere
or
it
may
be
a
perfectly
harmonious
division
of
labor
as
where
one
tender
to
his
children
is
stern
to
the
soldiers
or
prisoners
under
his
command
the
most
peculiar
social
self
which
one
is
apt
to
have
is
in
the
mind
of
the
person
one
is
in
love
with
the
good
or
bad
fortunes
of
this
self
cause
the
most
intense
elation
and
dejection
unreasonable
enough
as
measured
by
every
other
standard
than
that
of
the
organic
feeling
of
the
individual
to
his
own
consciousness
he
not
so
long
as
this
particular
social
self
fails
to
get
recognition
and
when
it
is
recognized
his
contentment
passes
all
bounds
a
man
good
or
bad
and
his
or
dishonor
are
names
for
one
of
his
social
selves
the
particular
social
self
of
a
man
called
his
honor
is
usually
the
result
of
one
of
those
splittings
of
which
we
have
spoken
it
is
his
image
in
the
eyes
of
his
own
which
exalts
or
condemns
him
as
he
conforms
or
not
to
certain
requirements
that
may
not
be
made
of
one
in
another
walk
of
life
thus
a
layman
may
abandon
a
city
infected
with
cholera
but
a
priest
or
a
doctor
would
think
such
an
act
incompatible
with
his
honor
a
soldier
honor
requires
him
to
fight
or
to
die
under
circumstances
where
another
man
can
apologize
or
run
away
with
no
stain
upon
his
social
self
a
judge
a
statesman
are
in
like
manner
debarred
by
the
honor
of
their
cloth
from
entering
into
pecuniary
relations
perfectly
honorable
to
persons
in
private
life
nothing
is
commoner
than
to
hear
people
discriminate
between
their
different
selves
of
this
sort
as
a
man
i
pity
you
but
as
an
official
i
must
show
you
no
mercy
as
a
politician
i
regard
him
as
an
ally
but
as
a
moralist
i
loathe
him
etc
what
may
be
called
is
one
of
the
very
strongest
forces
in
life
the
thief
must
not
steal
from
other
thieves
the
gambler
must
pay
his
though
he
pay
no
other
debts
in
the
world
the
code
of
honor
of
fashionable
society
has
throughout
history
been
full
of
permissions
as
well
as
of
vetoes
the
only
reason
for
following
either
of
which
is
that
so
we
best
serve
one
of
our
social
selves
you
must
not
lie
in
general
but
you
may
lie
as
much
as
you
please
if
asked
about
your
relations
with
a
lady
you
must
accept
a
challenge
from
an
equal
but
if
challenged
by
an
inferior
you
may
laugh
him
to
scorn
these
are
examples
of
what
is
meant
spiritual
by
the
me
so
far
as
it
belongs
to
the
empirical
self
i
mean
no
one
of
my
passing
states
of
consciousness
i
mean
rather
the
entire
collection
of
my
states
of
consciousness
my
psychic
faculties
and
dispositions
taken
concretely
this
collection
can
at
any
moment
become
an
object
to
my
thought
at
that
moment
and
awaken
emotions
like
those
awakened
by
any
of
the
other
portions
of
the
me
when
we
of
ourselves
as
all
the
other
ingredients
of
our
me
seem
relatively
external
possessions
even
within
the
spiritual
some
ingredients
seem
more
external
than
others
our
capacities
for
sensation
for
example
are
less
intimate
possessions
so
to
speak
than
our
emotions
and
desires
our
intellectual
processes
are
less
intimate
than
our
volitional
decisions
the
more
states
of
consciousness
are
thus
the
more
central
portions
of
the
spiritual
me
the
very
core
and
nucleus
of
our
self
as
we
know
it
the
very
sanctuary
of
our
life
is
the
sense
of
activity
which
certain
inner
states
possess
this
sense
of
activity
is
often
held
to
be
a
direct
revelation
of
the
living
substance
of
our
soul
whether
this
be
so
or
not
is
an
ulterior
question
i
wish
now
only
to
lay
down
the
peculiar
of
whatever
states
possess
this
quality
of
seeming
to
be
active
it
is
as
if
they
out
to
all
the
other
elements
of
our
experience
in
thus
feeling
about
them
probably
all
men
agree
feelings
and
emotions
of
come
after
the
constituents
this
is
of
two
sorts
and
more
properly
belongs
under
the
division
of
since
what
men
mean
by
that
name
is
rather
a
set
of
motor
tendencies
than
a
kind
of
feeling
properly
so
called
language
has
synonyms
enough
for
both
kinds
of
thus
pride
conceit
vanity
arrogance
vainglory
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
modesty
humility
confusion
diffidence
shame
mortification
contrition
the
sense
of
obloquy
and
personal
despair
these
two
opposite
classes
of
affection
seem
to
be
direct
and
elementary
endowments
of
our
nature
associationists
would
have
it
that
they
are
on
the
other
hand
secondary
phenomena
arising
from
a
rapid
computation
of
the
sensible
pleasures
or
pains
to
which
our
prosperous
or
debased
personal
predicament
is
likely
to
lead
the
sum
of
the
represented
pleasures
forming
the
and
the
sum
of
the
represented
pains
forming
the
opposite
feeling
of
shame
no
doubt
when
we
are
we
do
fondly
rehearse
all
possible
rewards
for
our
desert
and
when
in
a
fit
of
we
forebode
evil
but
the
mere
expectation
of
reward
not
the
and
the
mere
apprehension
of
the
evil
not
the
for
there
is
a
certain
average
tone
of
which
each
one
of
us
carries
about
with
him
and
which
is
independent
of
the
objective
reasons
we
may
have
for
satisfaction
or
discontent
that
is
a
very
man
may
abound
in
unfaltering
conceit
and
one
whose
success
in
life
is
secure
and
who
is
esteemed
by
all
may
remain
diffident
of
his
powers
to
the
end
one
may
say
however
that
the
normal
of
is
one
actual
success
or
failure
and
the
good
or
bad
actual
position
one
holds
in
the
world
he
put
in
his
thumb
and
pulled
out
a
plum
and
said
a
good
boy
am
i
a
man
with
a
broadly
extended
empirical
ego
with
powers
that
have
uniformly
brought
him
success
with
place
and
wealth
and
friends
and
fame
is
not
likely
to
be
visited
by
the
morbid
diffidences
and
doubts
about
himself
which
he
had
when
he
was
a
boy
is
not
this
great
babylon
which
i
have
planted
whereas
he
who
has
made
one
blunder
after
another
and
still
lies
in
middle
life
among
the
failures
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
is
liable
to
grow
all
sicklied
with
and
to
shrink
from
trials
with
which
his
powers
can
really
cope
the
emotions
themselves
of
and
abasement
are
of
a
unique
sort
each
as
worthy
to
be
classed
as
a
primitive
emotional
species
as
are
for
example
rage
or
pain
each
has
its
own
peculiar
physiognomical
expression
in
the
extensor
muscles
are
innervated
the
eye
is
strong
and
glorious
the
gait
rolling
and
elastic
the
nostril
dilated
and
a
peculiar
smile
plays
upon
the
lips
this
whole
complex
of
symptoms
is
seen
in
an
exquisite
way
in
lunatic
asylums
which
always
contain
some
patients
who
are
literally
mad
with
conceit
and
whose
fatuous
expression
and
absurdly
strutting
or
swaggering
gait
is
in
tragic
contrast
with
their
lack
of
any
valuable
personal
quality
it
is
in
these
same
castles
of
despair
that
we
find
the
strongest
examples
of
the
opposite
physiognomy
in
good
people
who
think
they
have
committed
unpardonable
sin
and
are
lost
forever
who
crouch
and
cringe
and
slink
from
notice
and
are
unable
to
speak
aloud
or
look
us
in
the
eye
like
fear
and
like
anger
in
similar
morbid
conditions
these
opposite
feelings
of
self
may
be
aroused
with
no
adequate
exciting
cause
and
in
fact
we
ourselves
know
how
the
barometer
of
our
and
confidence
rises
and
falls
from
one
day
to
another
through
causes
that
seem
to
be
visceral
and
organic
rather
than
rational
and
which
certainly
answer
to
no
corresponding
variations
in
the
esteem
in
which
we
are
held
by
our
friends
and
come
next
these
words
cover
a
large
number
of
our
fundamental
instinctive
impulses
we
have
those
of
those
of
and
those
of
all
the
ordinary
useful
reflex
actions
and
movements
of
alimentation
and
defence
are
acts
of
bodily
fear
and
anger
prompt
to
acts
that
are
useful
in
the
same
way
whilst
if
by
we
mean
the
providing
for
the
future
as
distinguished
from
maintaining
the
present
we
must
class
both
anger
and
fear
together
with
the
hunting
the
acquisitive
the
and
the
instincts
as
impulses
to
of
the
bodily
kind
really
however
these
latter
instincts
with
amativeness
parental
fondness
curiosity
and
emulation
seek
not
only
the
development
of
the
bodily
me
but
that
of
the
material
me
in
the
widest
possible
sense
of
the
word
our
in
turn
is
carried
on
directly
through
our
amativeness
and
friendliness
our
desire
to
please
and
attract
notice
and
admiration
our
emulation
and
jealousy
our
love
of
glory
influence
and
power
and
indirectly
through
whichever
of
the
material
impulses
prove
serviceable
as
means
to
social
ends
that
the
direct
social
impulses
are
probably
pure
instincts
is
easily
seen
the
noteworthy
thing
about
the
desire
to
be
by
others
is
that
its
strength
has
so
little
to
do
with
the
worth
of
the
recognition
computed
in
sensational
or
rational
terms
we
are
crazy
to
get
a
which
shall
be
large
to
be
able
to
say
when
any
one
is
mentioned
oh
i
know
him
well
and
to
be
bowed
to
in
the
street
by
half
the
people
we
meet
of
course
distinguished
friends
and
admiring
recognition
are
the
most
desirable
thackeray
somewhere
asks
his
readers
to
confess
whether
it
would
not
give
each
of
an
exquisite
pleasure
to
be
met
walking
down
pall
mall
with
a
duke
on
either
arm
but
in
default
of
dukes
and
envious
salutions
almost
anything
will
do
for
some
of
us
and
there
is
a
whole
race
of
beings
whose
passion
is
to
keep
their
names
in
the
newspapers
no
matter
under
what
heading
and
departures
paragraphs
gossip
even
scandal
will
suit
them
if
nothing
better
is
to
be
had
guiteau
garfield
assassin
is
an
example
of
the
extremity
to
which
this
sort
of
craving
for
the
notoriety
of
print
may
go
in
a
pathological
case
the
newspapers
bounded
his
mental
horizon
and
in
the
poor
wretch
prayer
on
the
scaffold
one
of
the
most
expressions
was
the

press
of
this
land

a
big
bill
to
settle
with
thee
o
lord
not
only
the
people
but
the
places
and
things
i
know
enlarge
my
self
in
a
sort
of
metaphoric
social
way
me
as
the
french
workman
says
of
the
implement
he
can
use
well
so
that
it
comes
about
that
persons
for
whose
we
care
nothing
are
nevertheless
persons
whose
notice
we
woo
and
that
many
a
man
truly
great
many
a
woman
truly
fastidious
in
most
respects
will
take
a
deal
of
trouble
to
dazzle
some
insignificant
cad
whose
whole
personality
they
heartily
despise
under
the
head
of
ought
to
be
included
every
impulse
towards
psychic
progress
whether
intellectual
moral
or
spiritual
in
the
narrow
sense
of
the
term
it
must
be
admitted
however
that
much
that
commonly
passes
for
spiritual
in
this
narrow
sense
is
only
material
and
social
beyond
the
grave
in
the
mohammedan
desire
for
paradise
and
the
christian
aspiration
not
to
be
damned
in
hell
the
materiality
of
the
goods
sought
is
undisguised
in
the
more
positive
and
refined
view
of
heaven
many
of
its
goods
the
fellowship
of
the
saints
and
of
our
dead
ones
and
the
presence
of
god
are
but
social
goods
of
the
most
exalted
kind
it
is
only
the
search
of
the
redeemed
inward
nature
the
spotlessness
from
sin
whether
here
or
hereafter
that
can
count
as
spiritual
pure
and
undefiled
but
this
broad
external
review
of
the
facts
of
the
life
of
the
me
will
be
incomplete
without
some
account
of
the
and
conflict
of
the
different
with
most
objects
of
desire
physical
nature
restricts
our
choice
to
but
one
of
many
represented
goods
and
even
so
it
is
here
i
am
often
confronted
by
the
necessity
of
standing
by
one
of
my
empirical
selves
and
relinquishing
the
rest
not
that
i
would
not
if
i
could
be
both
handsome
and
fat
and
well
dressed
and
a
great
athlete
and
make
a
million
a
year
be
a
wit
a
and
a
as
well
as
a
philosopher
a
philanthropist
statesman
warrior
and
african
explorer
as
well
as
a
and
saint
but
the
thing
is
simply
impossible
the
millionaire
work
would
run
counter
to
the
saint
the
and
the
philanthropist
would
trip
each
other
up
the
philosopher
and
the
could
not
well
keep
house
in
the
same
tenement
of
clay
such
different
characters
may
conceivably
at
the
outset
of
life
be
alike
to
a
man
but
to
make
any
one
of
them
actual
the
rest
must
more
or
less
be
suppressed
so
the
seeker
of
his
truest
strongest
deepest
self
must
review
the
list
carefully
and
pick
out
the
one
on
which
to
stake
his
salvation
all
other
selves
thereupon
become
unreal
but
the
fortunes
of
this
self
are
real
its
failures
are
real
failures
its
triumphs
real
triumphs
carrying
shame
and
gladness
with
them
this
is
as
strong
an
example
as
there
is
of
that
selective
industry
of
the
mind
on
which
i
insisted
some
pages
back
our
thought
incessantly
deciding
among
many
things
of
a
kind
which
ones
for
it
shall
be
realities
here
chooses
one
of
many
possible
selves
or
characters
and
forthwith
reckons
it
no
shame
to
fail
in
any
of
those
not
adopted
expressly
as
its
own
so
we
have
the
paradox
of
a
man
shamed
to
death
because
he
is
only
the
second
pugilist
or
the
second
oarsman
in
the
world
that
he
is
able
to
beat
the
whole
population
of
the
globe
minus
one
is
nothing
he
has
himself
to
beat
that
one
and
as
long
as
he
does
do
that
nothing
else
counts
he
is
to
his
own
regard
as
if
he
were
not
indeed
he
not
yonder
puny
fellow
however
whom
every
one
can
beat
suffers
no
chagrin
about
it
for
he
has
long
ago
abandoned
the
attempt
to
that
line
as
the
merchants
say
of
self
at
all
with
no
attempt
there
can
be
no
failure
with
no
failure
no
humiliation
so
our
in
this
world
depends
entirely
on
what
we
ourselves
to
be
and
do
it
is
determined
by
the
ratio
of
our
actualities
to
our
supposed
potentialities
a
fraction
of
which
our
pretensions
are
the
denominator
and
the
numerator
our
success
thus
such
a
fraction
may
be
increased
as
well
by
diminishing
the
denominator
as
by
increasing
the
numerator
to
give
up
pretensions
is
as
blessed
a
relief
as
to
get
them
gratified
and
where
disappointment
is
incessant
and
the
struggle
unending
this
is
what
men
will
always
do
the
history
of
evangelical
theology
with
its
conviction
of
sin
its
and
its
abandonment
of
salvation
by
works
is
the
deepest
of
possible
examples
but
we
meet
others
in
every
walk
of
life
there
is
the
strangest
lightness
about
the
heart
when
one
nothingness
in
a
particular
line
is
once
accepted
in
good
faith
is
not
bitterness
in
the
lot
of
the
lover
sent
away
by
the
final
inexorable
many
bostonians
and
inhabitants
of
other
cities
too
i
fear
would
be
happier
women
and
men
if
they
could
once
for
all
abandon
the
notion
of
keeping
up
a
musical
self
and
without
shame
let
people
hear
them
call
a
symphony
a
nuisance
how
pleasant
is
the
day
when
we
give
up
striving
to
be
young
or
slender
thank
god
we
say
illusions
are
gone
everything
added
to
the
self
is
a
burden
as
well
as
a
pride
a
certain
man
who
lost
every
penny
during
our
civil
war
went
and
actually
rolled
in
the
dust
saying
he
had
not
felt
so
free
and
happy
since
he
was
born
once
more
then
our
is
in
our
power
as
carlyle
says
make
thy
claim
of
wages
a
zero
then
hast
thou
the
world
under
thy
feet
well
did
the
wisest
of
our
time
write
it
is
only
with
that
life
properly
speaking
can
be
said
to
begin
neither
threats
nor
pleadings
can
move
a
man
unless
they

thus
can
we
as
a
rule
get

another

the
first
care
of
diplomatists
and
monarchs
and
all
who
wish
to

or
influence
is
accordingly
to
find
out
their

to

that
the
fulcrum
of

but
if
a
man
has
given
up
those
things
which
are
subject
to
foreign
fate
and
ceased
to
regard
them
as
parts
of
himself
at
all
we
are
powerless
over
him
the
stoic
receipt
for
contentment
was
to
dispossess
yourself
in
advance
of
all
that
was
out
of
your
own
power
then
fortune

rain
down
unfelt
epictetus
exhorts
us
by
thus
narrowing
and
at
the

time
solidifying
our
self
to
make
it
invulnerable
i
must
die
well
but
must
i
die
groaning
too
i
will
speak
what
appears
to
be
right
and
if
the
despot
says
i
will
put
you
to
death
i
will
reply
did
i
ever
tell
you
that
i
was
immortal
you
will
do
your
part
and
i
mine
it
is
yours
to
kill
and
mine
to
die
intrepid
yours
to
banish

to
depart
untroubled
how
do
we
act
in
a
voyage
we
choose
the
pilot
the
sailors
the
hour
afterwards
comes
a
storm
what
have
i
to
care
for
my
part
is
performed
this
matter
belongs
to
the
pilot
but
the
ship
is
sinking
what
then
have
i
to
do
that
which
alone
i
can
do
submit
to
being
drowned
without
fear
without
clamor
or
accusing
of
god
but
as
one
who
knows
that
what
is
born
must
likewise
die
this
stoic
fashion
though
efficacious
and
heroic
enough
in
its
place
and
time
is
it
must
be
confessed
only
possible
as
an
habitual
mood
of
the
soul
to
narrow
and
unsympathetic
characters
it
proceeds
altogether
by
exclusion
if
i
am
a
stoic
the
goods
i
can
not
appropriate
cease
to
be
goods
and
the
temptation
lies
very
near
to
deny
that
they
are
goods
at
all
we
find
this
mode
of
protecting
the
self
by
exclusion
and
denial
very
common
among
people
who
are
in
other
respects
not
stoics
all
narrow
people
their
me
they
it
from
the
region
of
what
they
can
not
securely
possess
people
who
do
resemble
them
or
who
treat
them
with
indifference
people
over
whom
they
gain
no
influence
are
people
on
whose
existence
however
meritorious
it
may
intrinsically
be
they
look
with
chill
negation
if
not
with
positive
hate
who
will
not
be
mine
i
will
exclude
from
existence
altogether
that
is
as
far
as
i
can
make
it
so
such
people
shall
be
as
if
they
were
not
thus
may
a
certain
absoluteness
and
definiteness
in
the
outline
of
my
me
console
me
for
the
smallness
of
its
content
sympathetic
people
on
the
contrary
proceed
by
the
entirely
opposite
way
of
expansion
and
inclusion
the
outline
of
their
self
often
gets
uncertain
enough
but
for
this
the
spread
of
its
content
more
than
atones
humani
a
me
let
them
despise
this
little
person
of
mine
and
treat
me
like
a
dog
shall
not
negate
so
long
as
i
have
a
soul
in
my
body
they
are
realities
as
much
as
i
am
what
positive
good
is
in
them
shall
be
mine
too
etc
the
magnanimity
of
these
expansive
natures
is
often
touching
indeed
such
persons
can
feel
a
sort
of
delicate
rapture
in
thinking
that
however
sick
and
generally
forsaken
they
may
be
they
yet
are
integral
parts
of
the
whole
of
this
brave
world
have
a
share
in
the
strength
of
the
the
happiness
of
the
young
people
the
wisdom
of
the
wise
ones
and
are
not
altogether
without
part
or
lot
in
the
good
fortunes
of
the
vanderbilts
and
the
hohenzollerns
themselves
thus
either
by
negating
or
by
embracing
the
ego
may
seek
to
establish
itself
in
reality
he
who
with
marcus
aurelius
can
truly
say
o
universe
i
wish
all
that
thou
wishest
has
a
self
from
which
every
trace
of
negativeness
and
obstructiveness
has
been
removed
no
wind
can
blow
except
to
fill
its
sails
hierarchy
of
the
a
tolerably
unanimous
opinion
ranges
the
different
selves
of
which
a
man
may
be
and
possessed
and
the
consequent
different
orders
of
his
in
an
scale
with
the
bodily
me
at
the
bottom
the
spiritual
me
at
top
and
the
material
selves
and
the
various
social
selves
our
merely
natural
would
lead
us
to
aggrandize
all
these
selves
we
give
up
deliberately
only
those
among
them
which
we
find
we
can
not
keep
our
unselfishness
is
thus
apt
to
be
a
of
necessity
and
it
is
not
without
all
show
of
reason
that
cynics
quote
the
fable
of
the
fox
and
the
grapes
in
describing
our
progress
therein
but
this
is
the
moral
education
of
the
race
and
if
we
agree
in
the
result
that
on
the
whole
the
selves
we
can
keep
are
the
intrinsically
best
we
need
not
complain
of
being
led
to
the
knowledge
of
their
superior
worth
in
such
a
tortuous
way
of
course
this
is
not
the
only
way
in
which
we
learn
to
subordinate
our
lower
selves
to
our
higher
a
direct
ethical
judgment
unquestionably
also
plays
its
part
and
last
not
least
we
apply
to
our
own
persons
judgments
originally
called
forth
by
the
acts
of
others
it
is
one
of
the
strangest
laws
of
our
nature
that
many
things
which
we
are
well
satisfied
with
in
ourselves
disgust
us
when
seen
in
others
with
another
man
bodily
hardly
anyone
has
any
sympathy
almost
as
little
with
his
cupidity
his
social
vanity
and
eagerness
his
jealousy
his
despotism
and
his
pride
left
absolutely
to
myself
i
should
probably
allow
all
these
spontaneous
tendencies
to
luxuriate
in
me
unchecked
and
it
would
be
long
before
i
formed
a
distinct
notion
of
the
order
of
their
subordination
but
having
constantly
to
pass
judgment
on
my
associates
i
come
ere
long
to
see
as
herr
horwicz
says
my
own
lusts
in
the
mirror
of
the
lusts
of
others
and
to
about
them
in
a
very
different
way
from
that
in
which
i
simply
of
course
the
moral
generalities
which
from
childhood
have
been
instilled
into
me
accelerate
enormously
the
advent
of
this
reflective
judgment
on
myself
so
it
comes
to
pass
that
as
aforesaid
men
have
arranged
the
various
selves
which
they
may
seek
in
an
hierarchical
scale
according
to
their
worth
a
certain
amount
of
bodily
selfishness
is
required
as
a
basis
for
all
the
other
selves
but
too
much
sensuality
is
despised
or
at
best
condoned
on
account
of
the
other
qualities
of
the
individual
the
wider
material
selves
are
regarded
as
higher
than
the
immediate
body
he
is
esteemed
a
poor
creature
who
is
unable
to
forego
a
little
meat
and
drink
and
warmth
and
sleep
for
the
sake
of
getting
on
in
the
world
the
social
self
as
a
whole
again
ranks
higher
than
the
material
self
as
a
whole
we
must
care
more
for
our
honor
our
friends
our
human
ties
than
for
a
sound
skin
or
wealth
and
the
spiritual
self
is
so
supremely
precious
that
rather
than
lose
it
a
man
ought
to
be
willing
to
give
up
friends
and
good
fame
and
property
and
life
itself
each
kind
of
me
material
social
and
spiritual
men
distinguish
between
the
immediate
and
actual
and
the
remote
and
between
the
narrower
and
the
wider
view
to
the
detriment
of
the
former
and
the
advantage
of
the
latter
one
must
forego
a
present
bodily
enjoyment
for
the
sake
of
one
general
health
one
must
abandon
the
dollar
in
the
hand
for
the
sake
of
the
hundred
dollars

come
one
must
make
an
enemy
of
his

interlocutor

thereby

valued
circle

without

and

compass

salvation
of
all
these
wider

potential
selves
potential
social
is
the
most
interesting
by
reason
of
certain
apparent
paradoxes
to
which
it
leads
in
conduct
and
by
reason
of
its
connection
with
our
moral
and
religious
life
when
for
motives
of
honor
and
conscience
i
brave
the
condemnation
of
my
own
family
club
and
when
as
a
protestant
i
turn
catholic
as
a
catholic
freethinker
as
a
practitioner
homÅopath
or
what
not
i
am
always
inwardly
strengthened
in
my
course
and
steeled
against
the
loss
of
my
actual
social
self
by
the
thought
of
other
and
better
social
judges
than
those
whose
verdict
goes
against
me
now
the
ideal
social
self
which
i
thus
seek
in
appealing
to
their
decision
may
be
very
remote
it
may
be
represented
as
barely
possible
i
may
not
hope
for
its
realization
during
my
lifetime
i
may
even
expect
the
future
generations
which
would
approve
me
if
they
knew
me
to
know
nothing
about
me
when
i
am
dead
and
gone
yet
still
the
emotion
that
beckons
me
on
is
indubitably
the
pursuit
of
an
ideal
social
self
of
a
self
that
is
at
least
of
approving
recognition
by
the
highest
judging
companion
if
such
companion
there
be
this
self
is
the
true
the
intimate
the
ultimate
the
permanent
me
which
i
seek
this
judge
is
god
the
absolute
mind
the
companion
we
hear
in
these
days
of
scientific
enlightenment
a
great
deal
of
discussion
about
the
efficacy
of
prayer
and
many
reasons
are
given
us
why
we
should
not
pray
whilst
others
are
given
us
why
we
should
but
in
all
this
very
little
is
said
of
the
reason
why
we
pray
which
is
simply
that
we
can
not
help
praying
it
seems
probable
that
in
spite
of
all
that
may
do
to
the
contrary
men
will
continue
to
pray
to
the
end
of
time
unless
their
mental
nature
changes
in
a
manner
which
nothing
we
know
should
lead
us
to
expect
the
impulse
to
pray
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
fact
that
whilst
the
innermost
of
the
empirical
selves
of
a
man
is
a
self
of
the
sort
it
yet
can
find
its
only
adequate
in
an
ideal
world
all
progress
in
the
social
self
is
the
substitution
of
higher
tribunals
for
lower
this
ideal
tribunal
is
the
highest
and
most
men
either
continually
or
occasionally
carry
a
reference
to
it
in
their
breast
the
humblest
outcast
on
this
earth
can
feel
himself
to
be
real
and
valid
by
means
of
this
higher
recognition
and
on
the
other
hand
for
most
of
us
a
world
with
no
such
inner
refuge
when
the
outer
social
self
failed
and
dropped
from
us
would
be
the
abyss
of
horror
i
say
most
of
us
because
it
is
probable
that
individuals
differ
a
good
deal
in
the
degree
in
which
they
are
haunted
by
this
sense
of
an
ideal
spectator
it
is
a
much
more
essential
part
of
the
consciousness
of
some
men
than
of
others
those
who
have
the
most
of
it
are
possibly
the
most
men
but
i
am
sure
that
even
those
who
say
they
are
altogether
without
it
deceive
themselves
and
really
have
it
in
some
degree
only
a
animal
could
be
completely
without
it
probably
no
one
can
make
sacrifices
for
without
to
some
degree
personifying
the
principle
of
right
for
which
the
sacrifice
is
made
and
expecting
thanks
from
it
social
unselfishness
in
other
words
can
hardly
exist
social
suicide
hardly
occur
to
a
man
mind
even
such
texts
as
job
though
he
slay
me
yet
will
i
trust
him
or
marcus
aurelius
if
gods
hate
me
and
my
children
there
is
a
reason
for
it
can
least
of
all
be
cited
to
prove
the
contrary
for
beyond
all
doubt
job
revelled
in
the
thought
of
jehovah
recognition
of
the
worship
after
the
slaying
should
have
been
done
and
the
roman
emperor
felt
sure
the
absolute
reason
would
not
be
all
indifferent
to
his
acquiescence
in
the
gods
dislike
the
old
test
of
piety
are
you
willing
to
be
damned
for
the
glory
of
god
was
probably
never
answered
in
the
affirmative
except
by
those
who
felt
sure
in
their
heart
of
hearts
that
god
would
them
with
their
willingness
and
set
more
store
by
them
thus
than
if
in
his
unfathomable
scheme
he
had
not
damned
them
at
all
uses
of
on
zoÃ¶logical
principles
it
is
easy
to
see
why
we
have
been
endowed
with
impulses
of
and
with
emotions
of
and
the
reverse
unless
our
consciousness
were
something
more
than
cognitive
unless
it
experienced
a
partiality
for
certain
of
the
objects
which
in
succession
occupy
its
ken
it
could
not
long
maintain
itself
in
existence
for
by
an
inscrutable
necessity
each
human
mind
appearance
on
this
earth
is
conditioned
upon
the
integrity
of
the
body
with
which
it
belongs
upon
the
treatment
which
that
body
gets
from
others
and
upon
the
spiritual
dispositions
which
use
it
as
their
tool
and
lead
it
either
towards
longevity
or
to
destruction
own
body
then
first
of
all
its
friends
next
and
finally
its
spiritual
must
the
supremely
interesting
objects
for
each
human
each
mind
to
begin
with
must
have
a
certain
minimum
of
selfishness
in
the
shape
of
instincts
of
bodily
in
order
to
exist
this
minimum
must
be
there
as
a
basis
for
all
farther
conscious
acts
whether
of
or
of
a
selfishness
more
subtle
still
all
minds
must
have
come
by
the
way
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
if
by
no
directer
path
to
take
an
intense
interest
in
the
bodies
to
which
they
are
yoked
altogether
apart
from
any
interest
in
the
pure
ego
which
they
also
possess
and
similarly
with
the
images
of
their
person
in
the
minds
of
others
i
should
not
be
extant
now
had
i
not
become
sensitive
to
looks
of
approval
or
disapproval
on
the
faces
among
which
my
life
is
cast
looks
of
contempt
cast
on
other
persons
need
affect
me
in
no
such
peculiar
way
my
spiritual
powers
again
must
interest
me
more
than
those
of
other
people
and
for
the
same
reason
i
should
not
be
here
at
all
unless
i
had
cultivated
them
and
kept
them
from
decay
and
the
same
law
which
made
me
once
care
for
them
makes
me
care
for
them
still
all
these
three
things
form
the
but
all
these
things
are
properly
so
called
to
the
thought
which
at
any
time
may
be
doing
the
thinking
and
if
the
zoÃ¶logical
and
evolutionary
point
of
view
is
the
true
one
there
is
no
reason
why
one
object
not
arouse
passion
and
interest
as
primitively
and
instinctively
as
any
other
the
phenomenon
of
passion
is
in
origin
and
essence
the
same
whatever
be
the
target
upon
which
it
is
discharged
and
what
the
target
actually
happens
to
be
is
solely
a
question
of
fact
i
might
conceivably
be
as
much
fascinated
and
as
primitively
so
by
the
care
of
my
neighbor
body
as
by
the
care
of
my
own
i
thus
fascinated
by
the
care
of
my
body
the
only
check
to
such
exuberant
interests
is
natural
selection
which
would
weed
out
such
as
were
very
harmful
to
the
individual
or
to
his
tribe
many
such
interests
however
remain
unweeded
out
the
interest
in
the
opposite
sex
for
example
which
seems
in
mankind
stronger
than
is
called
for
by
its
utilitarian
need
and
alongside
of
them
remain
interests
like
that
in
alcoholic
intoxication
or
in
musical
sounds
which
for
aught
we
can
see
are
without
any
utility
whatever
the
sympathetic
instincts
and
the
egoistic
ones
are
thus
coÃ¶rdinate
they
arise
so
far
as
we
can
tell
on
the
same
psychologic
level
the
only
difference
between
them
is
that
the
instincts
called
egoistic
form
much
the
larger
mass
the
following
table
may
serve
for
a
summary
of
what
has
been
said
thus
far
the
empirical
life
of
self
is
divided
as
below
into
material
social
spiritual
appetites

superiority
of
wealth

etc
fear
of
poverty

of
inferiority
shame
etc
or
of
guilt
b
the
self
as
knower
the
i
or
ego
is
a
very
much
more
difficult
subject
of
inquiry
than
the
me
it
is
that
which
at
any
given
moment
conscious
whereas
the
me
is
only
one
of
the
things
which
it
is
conscious
in
other
words
it
is
the
and
the
question
immediately
comes
up
is
the
thinker
is
it
the
passing
state
of
consciousness
itself
or
is
it
something
deeper
and
less
mutable
the
passing
state
we
have
seen
to
be
the
very
embodiment
of
change
see
yet
each
of
us
spontaneously
considers
that
by
he
means
something
always
the
same
this
has
led
most
philosophers
to
postulate
behind
the
passing
state
of
consciousness
a
permanent
substance
or
agent
whose
modification
or
act
it
is
this
agent
is
the
thinker
the
is
only
its
instrument
or
means
ego
are
so
many
names
for
this
more
permanent
sort
of
thinker
not
discriminating
them
just
yet
let
us
proceed
to
define
our
idea
of
the
passing
state
of
consciousness
more
clearly
unity
of
the
passing
already
in
speaking
of
from
the
point
of
view
of
fechner
idea
of
measuring
them
we
saw
that
there
was
no
ground
for
calling
them
compounds
but
what
is
true
of
sensations
cognizing
simple
qualities
is
also
true
of
thoughts
with
complex
objects
composed
of
many
parts
this
proposition
unfortunately
runs
counter
to
a
prejudice
and
will
have
to
be
defended
at
some
length
and
psychologists
of
almost
every
school
have
agreed
that
whenever
an
object
of
thought
contains
many
elements
the
thought
itself
must
be
made
up
of
just
as
many
ideas
one
idea
for
each
element
all
fused
together
in
appearance
but
really
separate
there
can
be
no
difficulty
in
admitting
that
association
form
the
ideas
of
an
indefinite
number
of
individuals
into
one
complex
idea
says
james
mill
because
it
is
an
acknowledged
fact
have
we
not
the
idea
of
an
army
and
is
not
that
precisely
the
ideas
of
an
indefinite
number
of
men
formed
into
one
idea
similar
quotations
might
be
multiplied
and
the
reader
own
first
impressions
probably
would
rally
to
their
support
suppose
for
example
he
thinks
that
the
pack
of
cards
is
on
the
table
if
he
begins
to
reflect
he
is
as
likely
as
not
to
say
well
is
that
a
thought
of
the
pack
of
cards
is
it
of
the
cards
as
included
in
the
pack
it
of
the
table
and
of
the
legs
of
the
table
as
well
has
my
thought
then
all
these
parts
one
part
for
the
pack
and
another
for
the
table
and
within
the
a
part
for
each
card
as
within
the
a
part
for
each
leg
and
is
each
of
these
parts
an
idea
and
can
thought
then
be
anything
but
an
assemblage
or
pack
of
ideas
each
answering
to
some
element
of
what
it
knows
plausible
as
such
considerations
may
seem
it
is
astonishing
how
little
force
they
have
in
assuming
a
pack
of
ideas
each
cognizant
of
some
one
element
of
the
fact
one
has
assumed
nothing
has
been
assumed
which
knows
the
whole
fact
the
idea
which
on
the
hypothesis
of
the
pack
of
ideas
knows
the
ace
of
spades
must
be
ignorant
of
the
leg
of
the
table
since
to
account
for
that
knowledge
another
special
idea
is
by
the
same
hypothesis
invoked
and
so
on
with
the
rest
of
the
ideas
all
equally
ignorant
of
each
other
objects
and
yet
in
the
actual
living
human
mind
what
knows
the
cards
also
knows
the
table
its
legs
for
all
these
things
are
known
in
relation
to
each
other
and
at
once
our
notion
of
the
abstract
numbers
eight
four
two
is
as
truly
one
feeling
of
the
mind
as
our
notion
of
simple
unity
our
idea
of
a
couple
is
not
a
couple
of
ideas
but
the
reader
may
say
is
not
the
taste
of
lemonade
composed
of
that
of
lemon
that
of
sugar
no
i
reply
this
is
taking
the
combining
of
objects
for
that
of
feelings
the
physical
lemonade
contains
both
the
lemon
and
the
sugar
but
its
taste
does
not
contain
their
tastes
for
if
there
are
any
two
things
which
are
certainly
present
in
the
taste
of
lemonade
those
are
the
pure
on
the
one
hand
and
the
pure
on
the
other
these
tastes
are
absent
utterly
a
taste
somewhat
both
of
them
is
there
but
that
is
a
distinct
state
of
mind
altogether
mental
states
can
not
but
not
only
is
the
notion
that
our
ideas
are
combinations
of
smaller
ideas
improbable
it
is
logically
unintelligible
it
leaves
out
the
essential
features
of
all
the
which
we
actually
know
the
which
we
actually
know
effects
by
the
units
said
to
be
upon
some
entity
other
than
themselves
without
this
feature
of
a
medium
or
vehicle
the
notion
of
combination
has
no
sense
in
other
words
no
possible
number
of
entities
call
them
as
you
like
whether
forces
material
particles
or
mental
elements
can
sum
together
each
remains
in
the
sum
what
it
always
was
and
the
sum
itself
exists
only
a
who
happens
to
overlook
the
units
and
to
apprehend
the
sum
as
such
or
else
it
exists
in
the
shape
of
some
other
effect
on
an
entity
external
to
the
sum
itself
when
and
o
are
said
to
combine
into
and
thenceforward
to
exhibit
new
properties
the
is
just
the
old
atoms
in
the
new
position
the
properties
are
just
their
combined
when
in
this
position
upon
external
media
such
as
our
and
the
various
reagents
on
which
water
may
exert
its
properties
and
be
known
just
so
the
strength
of
many
men
may
combine
when
they
pull
upon
one
rope
of
many
muscular
fibres
when
they
pull
upon
one
tendon
in
the
parallelogram
of
forces
the
do
not
combine
into
the
diagonal
resultant
a
is
needed
on
which
they
may
impinge
to
exhibit
their
resultant
effect
no
more
do
musical
sounds
combine
into
concords
or
discords
concord
and
discord
are
names
for
their
combined
effects
on
that
external
medium
the
where
the
elemental
units
are
supposed
to
be
feelings
the
case
is
in
no
wise
altered
take
a
hundred
of
them
shuffle
them
and
pack
them
as
close
together
as
you
can
whatever
that
may
mean
still
each
remains
the
same
feeling
it
always
was
shut
in
its
own
skin
windowless
ignorant
of
what
the
other
feelings
are
and
mean
there
would
be
a
feeling
there
if
when
a
group
or
series
of
such
feelings
were
set
up
a
consciousness
to
the
group
as
should
emerge
and
this
one
hundred
and
first
feeling
would
be
a
totally
new
fact
the
one
hundred
original
feelings
might
by
a
curious
physical
law
be
a
signal
for
its
when
they
came
together
we
often
have
to
learn
things
separately
before
we
know
them
as
a
sum
but
they
would
have
no
substantial
identity
with
the
new
feeling
nor
it
with
them
and
one
could
never
deduce
the
one
from
the
others
or
in
any
intelligible
sense
say
that
they
it
out
of
themselves
take
a
sentence
of
a
dozen
words
and
take
twelve
men
and
tell
to
each
one
word
then
stand
the
men
in
a
row
or
jam
them
in
a
bunch
and
let
each
think
of
his
word
as
intently
as
he
will
nowhere
will
there
be
a
consciousness
of
the
whole
sentence
we
talk
it
is
true
of
the
of
the
age
and
the
of
the
people
and
in
various
ways
we
hypostatize
opinion
but
we
know
this
to
be
symbolic
speech
and
never
dream
that
the
spirit
opinion
or
sentiment
constitutes
a
consciousness
other
than
and
additional
to
that
of
the
several
individuals
whom
the
words
or
denote
the
private
minds
do
not
agglomerate
into
a
higher
compound
mind
this
has
always
been
the
invincible
contention
of
the
spiritualists
against
the
associationists
in
psychology
the
associationists
say
the
mind
is
constituted
by
a
multiplicity
of
distinct
into
a
unity
there
is
they
say
an
idea
of
and
also
an
idea
of
they
say
there
is
an
idea
of
or
of
and
together
which
is
like
saying
that
the
mathematical
square
of
plus
that
of
is
equal
to
the
square
of
a
palpable
untruth
idea
of
idea
of
is
identical
with
idea
of
it
is
one
they
are
two
in
it
what
knows
also
knows
in
them
what
knows
is
expressly
posited
as
not
knowing
etc
in
short
the
two
separate
ideas
can
never
by
any
logic
be
made
to
figure
as
one
idea
if
one
idea
of
for
example
come
as
a
matter
of
fact
after
the
two
separate
ideas
of
and
of
then
we
must
hold
it
to
be
as
direct
a
product
of
the
later
conditions
as
the
two
separate
ideas
were
of
the
earlier
conditions
simplest
thing
therefore
if
we
are
to
assume
the
existence
of
a
stream
of
consciousness
at
all
would
be
to
suppose
that
things
that
are
known
together
are
known
in
single
pulses
of
that
the
things
may
be
many
and
may
occasion
many
currents
in
the
brain
but
the
psychic
phenomenon
correlative
to
these
many
currents
is
one
integral
transitive
or
substantive
see
to
which
the
many
things
appear
soul
as
a
combining
the
spiritualists
in
philosophy
have
been
prompt
to
see
that
things
which
are
known
together
are
known
by
one
but
that
something
they
say
is
no
mere
passing
thought
but
a
simple
and
permanent
spiritual
being
on
which
many
ideas
combine
their
effects
it
makes
no
difference
in
this
connection
whether
this
being
be
called
soul
ego
or
spirit
in
either
case
its
chief
function
is
that
of
a
combining
medium
this
is
a
different
vehicle
of
knowledge
from
that
in
which
we
just
said
that
the
mystery
of
knowing
things
together
might
be
most
simply
lodged
which
is
the
real
knower
this
permanent
being
or
our
passing
state
if
we
had
other
grounds
not
yet
considered
for
admitting
the
soul
into
our
psychology
then
getting
there
on
those
grounds
she
might
turn
out
to
be
the
knower
too
but
if
there
be
no
grounds
for
admitting
the
soul
we
had
better
cling
to
our
passing
as
the
exclusive
agents
of
knowledge
for
we
have
to
assume
their
existence
anyhow
in
psychology
and
the
knowing
of
many
things
together
is
just
as
well
accounted
for
when
we
call
it
one
of
their
functions
as
when
we
call
it
a
reaction
of
the
soul
it
is
not
by
either
conception
and
has
to
figure
in
psychology
as
a
datum
that
is
ultimate
but
there
are
other
alleged
grounds
for
admitting
the
soul
into
psychology
and
the
chief
of
them
is
sense
of
personal
in
the
last
chapter
it
was
stated
see
that
the
thoughts
which
we
actually
know
to
exist
do
not
fly
about
loose
but
seem
each
to
belong
to
some
one
thinker
and
not
to
another
each
thought
out
of
a
multitude
of
other
thoughts
of
which
it
may
think
is
able
to
distinguish
those
which
belong
to
it
from
those
which
do
not
the
former
have
a
warmth
and
intimacy
about
them
of
which
the
latter
are
completely
devoid
and
the
result
is
a
me
of
yesterday
judged
to
be
in
some
peculiarly
subtle
sense
the
with
the
i
who
now
make
the
judgment
as
a
mere
subjective
phenomenon
the
judgment
presents
no
special
mystery
it
belongs
to
the
great
class
of
judgments
of
sameness
and
there
is
nothing
more
remarkable
in
making
a
judgment
of
sameness
in
the
first
person
than
in
the
second
or
the
third
the
intellectual
operations
seem
essentially
alike
whether
i
say
am
the
same
as
i
was
or
whether
i
say
pen
is
the
same
as
it
was
yesterday
it
is
as
easy
to
think
this
as
to
think
the
opposite
and
say
of
us
is
the
same
the
only
question
which
we
have
to
consider
is
whether
it
be
a
right
judgment
the
sameness
predicated
really
there
in
the
self
as
if
in
the
sentence
i
am
the
same
that
i
was
yesterday
we
take
the
broadly
it
is
evident
that
in
many
ways
i
am
the
same
as
a
concrete
me
i
am
somewhat
different
from
what
i
was
then
hungry
now
full
then
walking
now
at
rest
then
poorer
now
richer
then
younger
now
older
etc
and
yet
in
other
ways
i
the
same
and
we
may
call
these
the
essential
ways
my
name
and
profession
and
relations
to
the
world
are
identical
my
face
my
faculties
and
store
of
memories
are
practically
indistinguishable
now
and
then
moreover
the
me
of
now
and
the
me
of
then
are
the
alterations
were
gradual
and
never
affected
the
whole
of
me
at
once
so
far
then
my
personal
identity
is
just
like
the
sameness
predicated
of
any
other
aggregate
thing
it
is
a
conclusion
grounded
either
on
the
resemblance
in
essential
respects
or
on
the
continuity
of
the
phenomena
compared
and
it
must
not
be
taken
to
mean
more
than
these
grounds
warrant
or
treated
as
a
sort
of
metaphysical
or
absolute
unity
in
which
all
differences
are
overwhelmed
the
past
and
present
selves
compared
are
the
same
just
so
far
as
they
the
same
and
no
farther
they
are
the
same
in
but
this
generic
sameness
coexists
with
generic
differences
just
as
real
and
if
from
the
one
point
of
view
i
am
one
self
from
another
i
am
quite
as
truly
many
similarly
of
the
attribute
of
continuity
it
gives
to
the
self
the
unity
of
mere
connectedness
or
unbrokenness
a
perfectly
definite
phenomenal
thing
but
it
gives
not
a
jot
or
tittle
more
in
the
self
as
but
all
this
is
said
only
of
the
me
or
self
as
known
in
the
judgment
am
the
same
the
was
taken
broadly
as
the
concrete
person
suppose
however
that
we
take
it
narrowly
as
the
as
to
all
the
concrete
determinations
of
the
me
belong
and
are
known
does
there
not
then
appear
an
absolute
identity
at
different
times
that
something
which
at
every
moment
goes
out
and
knowingly
appropriates
the
of
the
past
and
discards
the
as
foreign
is
it
not
a
permanent
abiding
principle
of
spiritual
activity
identical
with
itself
wherever
found
that
it
is
such
a
principle
is
the
reigning
doctrine
both
of
philosophy
and
and
yet
reflection
finds
it
difficult
to
justify
the
idea
there
were
no
passing
states
of
then
indeed
we
might
suppose
an
abiding
principle
absolutely
one
with
itself
to
be
the
ceaseless
thinker
in
each
one
of
us
but
if
the
states
of
consciousness
be
accorded
as
realities
no
such
identity
in
the
thinker
need
be
supposed
yesterday
and
states
of
consciousnesses
have
no
identity
for
when
one
is
here
the
other
is
irrevocably
dead
and
gone
but
they
have
a
identity
for
both
know
the
same
objects
and
so
far
as
the
me
is
one
of
those
objects
they
react
upon
it
in
an
identical
way
greeting
it
and
calling
it
and
opposing
it
to
all
the
other
things
they
know
this
functional
identity
seems
really
the
only
sort
of
identity
in
the
thinker
which
the
facts
require
us
to
suppose
successive
thinkers
numerically
distinct
but
all
aware
of
the
same
past
in
the
same
way
form
an
adequate
vehicle
for
all
the
experience
of
personal
unity
and
sameness
which
we
actually
have
and
just
such
a
train
of
successive
thinkers
is
the
stream
of
mental
states
each
with
its
complex
object
cognized
and
emotional
and
selective
reaction
thereupon
which
psychology
treated
as
a
natural
science
has
to
assume
see
the
logical
conclusion
seems
then
to
be
that
states
of
consciousness
are
all
that
psychology
needs
to
do
her
work
with
metaphysics
or
theology
may
prove
the
soul
to
exist
but
for
psychology
the
hypothesis
of
such
a
substantial
principle
of
unity
is
the
i
appropriates
the
but
should
each
successive
mental
state
appropriate
the
same
past
me
i
spoke
a
while
ago
of
my
own
past
experiences
appearing
to
me
with
a
and
intimacy
which
the
experiences
thought
of
by
me
as
having
occurred
to
other
people
lack
this
leads
us
to
the
answer
sought
my
present
me
is
felt
with
warmth
and
intimacy
the
heavy
warm
mass
of
my
body
is
there
and
the
nucleus
of
the
me
the
sense
of
intimate
activity
is
there
we
can
not
realize
our
present
self
without
simultaneously
feeling
one
or
other
of
these
two
things
any
other
object
of
thought
which
brings
these
two
things
with
it
into
consciousness
will
be
thought
with
a
warmth
and
an
intimacy
like
those
which
cling
to
the
present
me
any
object
which
fulfils
this
condition
will
be
thought
with
such
warmth
and
intimacy
but
which
distant
objects
fulfil
the
condition
when
represented
obviously
those
and
only
those
which
fulfilled
it
when
they
were
alive
we
shall
still
represent
with
the
animal
warmth
upon
them
to
them
may
possibly
still
cling
the
flavor
of
the
inner
activity
taken
in
the
act
and
by
a
natural
consequence
we
shall
assimilate
them
to
each
other
and
to
the
warm
and
intimate
self
we
now
feel
within
us
as
we
think
and
separate
them
as
a
collection
from
whatever
objects
have
not
this
mark
much
as
out
of
a
herd
of
cattle
let
loose
for
the
winter
on
some
wide
western
prairie
the
owner
picks
out
and
sorts
together
when
the
comes
in
the
spring
all
the
beasts
on
which
he
finds
his
own
particular
brand
well
just
such
objects
are
the
past
experiences
which
i
now
call
mine
other
men
experiences
no
matter
how
much
i
may
know
about
them
never
bear
this
vivid
this
peculiar
brand
this
is
why
peter
awakening
in
the
same
bed
with
paul
and
recalling
what
both
had
in
mind
before
they
went
to
sleep
reidentifies
and
appropriates
the
ideas
as
his
and
is
never
tempted
to
confuse
them
with
those
cold
and
ones
which
he
ascribes
to
paul
as
well
might
he
confound
paul
body
which
he
only
sees
with
his
own
body
which
he
sees
but
also
feels
each
of
us
when
he
awakens
says
here
the
same
old
me
again
just
as
he
says
here
the
same
old
bed
the
same
old
room
the
same
old
world
and
similarly
in
our
waking
hours
though
each
pulse
of
consciousness
dies
away
and
is
replaced
by
another
yet
that
other
among
the
things
it
knows
knows
its
own
predecessor
and
finding
it
in
the
way
we
have
described
greets
it
saying
thou
art
and
part
of
the
same
self
with
me
each
later
thought
knowing
and
including
thus
the
thoughts
that
went
before
is
the
final
receptacle
and
appropriating
them
is
the
final
owner
of
all
that
they
contain
and
own
as
kant
says
it
is
as
if
elastic
balls
were
to
have
not
only
motion
but
knowledge
of
it
and
a
first
ball
were
to
transmit
both
its
motion
and
its
consciousness
to
a
second
which
took
both
up
into
consciousness
and
passed
them
to
a
third
until
the
last
ball
held
all
that
the
other
balls
had
held
and
realized
it
as
its
own
it
is
this
trick
which
the
nascent
thought
has
of
immediately
taking
up
the
expiring
thought
and
it
which
leads
to
the
appropriation
of
most
of
the
remoter
constituents
of
the
self
who
owns
the
last
self
owns
the
self
before
the
last
for
what
possesses
the
possessor
possesses
the
possessed
it
is
impossible
to
discover
any
features
in
personal
identity
which
this
sketch
does
not
contain
impossible
to
imagine
how
any
transcendent
principle
of
unity
were
such
a
principle
there
could
shape
matters
to
any
other
result
or
be
known
by
any
other
fruit
than
just
this
production
of
a
stream
of
consciousness
each
successive
part
of
which
should
know
and
knowing
hug
to
itself
and
adopt
all
those
that
went
before
thus
standing
as
the
of
an
entire
past
stream
with
which
it
is
in
no
wise
to
be
identified
and
multiplications
of
the
the
me
like
every
other
aggregate
changes
as
it
grows
the
passing
states
of
consciousness
which
should
preserve
in
their
succession
an
identical
knowledge
of
its
past
wander
from
their
duty
letting
large
portions
drop
from
out
of
their
ken
and
representing
other
portions
wrong
the
identity
which
we
recognize
as
we
survey
the
long
procession
can
only
be
the
relative
identity
of
a
slow
shifting
in
which
there
is
always
some
common
ingredient
retained
the
commonest
element
of
all
the
most
uniform
is
the
possession
of
some
common
memories
however
different
the
man
may
be
from
the
youth
both
look
back
on
the
same
childhood
and
call
it
their
own
thus
the
identity
found
by
the
in
its
is
only
a
loosely
construed
thing
an
identity
the
whole
just
like
that
which
any
outside
observer
might
find
in
the
same
assemblage
of
facts
we
often
say
of
a
man
is
so
changed
one
would
not
know
him
and
so
does
a
man
less
often
speak
of
himself
these
changes
in
the
recognized
by
the
i
or
by
outside
observers
may
be
grave
or
slight
they
deserve
some
notice
here
the
mutations
of
the
self
may
be
divided
into
two
main
classes
alterations
of
memory
and
alterations
in
the
present
bodily
and
spiritual
selves
of
the
alterations
of
memory
little
need
be
said
they
are
so
familiar
losses
of
memory
are
a
normal
incident
in
life
especially
in
advancing
years
and
the
person
as
shrinks
with
the
facts
that
disappear
the
memory
of
dreams
and
of
experiences
in
the
hypnotic
trance
rarely
survives
false
memories
also
are
by
no
means
rare
occurrences
and
whenever
they
occur
they
distort
our
consciousness
of
our
me
most
people
probably
are
in
doubt
about
certain
matters
ascribed
to
their
past
they
may
have
seen
them
may
have
said
them
done
them
or
they
may
only
have
dreamed
or
imagined
they
did
so
the
content
of
a
dream
will
oftentimes
insert
itself
into
the
stream
of
real
life
in
a
most
perplexing
way
the
most
frequent
source
of
false
memory
is
the
accounts
we
give
to
others
of
our
experiences
such
accounts
we
almost
always
make
both
more
simple
and
more
interesting
than
the
truth
we
quote
what
we
should
have
said
or
done
rather
than
what
we
really
said
or
did
and
in
the
first
telling
we
may
be
fully
aware
of
the
distinction
but
ere
long
the
fiction
expels
the
reality
from
memory
and
reigns
in
its
stead
alone
this
is
one
great
source
of
the
fallibility
of
testimony
meant
to
be
quite
honest
especially
where
the
marvellous
is
concerned
the
story
takes
a
tilt
that
way
and
the
memory
follows
the
story
when
we
pass
beyond
alterations
of
memory
to
abnormal
in
the
present
we
have
graver
disturbances
these
alterations
are
of
three
main
types
but
our
knowledge
of
the
elements
and
causes
of
these
changes
of
personality
is
so
slight
that
the
division
into
types
must
not
be
regarded
as
having
any
profound
significance
the
types
are
insane
delusions
Î²
alternating
selves
mediumships
or
possessions
Î±
in
insanity
we
often
have
delusions
projected
into
the
past
which
are
melancholic
or
sanguine
according
to
the
character
of
the
disease
but
the
worst
alterations
of
the
self
come
from
present
perversions
of
sensibility
and
impulse
which
leave
the
past
undisturbed
but
induce
the
patient
to
think
that
the
present
is
an
altogether
new
personage
something
of
this
sort
happens
normally
in
the
rapid
expansion
of
the
whole
character
intellectual
as
well
as
volitional
which
takes
place
after
the
time
of
puberty
the
pathological
cases
are
curious
enough
to
merit
longer
notice
the
basis
of
our
personality
as
ribot
says
is
that
feeling
of
our
vitality
which
because
it
is
so
perpetually
present
remains
in
the
background
of
our
consciousness
it
is
the
basis
because
always
present
always
acting
without
peace
or
rest
it
knows
neither
sleep
nor
fainting
and
lasts
as
long
as
life
itself
of
which
it
is
one
form
it
serves
as
a
support
to
that
which
memory
constitutes
it
is
the
medium
of
association
among
its
other
parts
suppose
now
that
it
were
possible
at
once
to
change
our
body
and
put
another
into
its
place
skeleton
vessels
viscera
muscles
skin
everything
made
new
except
the
nervous
system
with
its
memory
of
the
past
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
in
such
a
case
the
afflux
of
unaccustomed
vital
sensations
would
produce
the
gravest
disorders
between
the
old
sense
of
existence
engraved
on
the
nervous
system
and
the
new
one
acting
with
all
the
intensity
of
its
reality
and
novelty
there
would
be
irreconcilable
contradiction
what
the
particular
perversions
of
the
bodily
sensibility
may
be
which
give
rise
to
these
contradictions
is
for
the
most
part
impossible
for
a
person
to
conceive
one
patient
has
another
self
that
repeats
all
his
thoughts
for
him
others
amongst
whom
are
some
of
the
first
characters
in
history
have
internal
dÃ¦mons
who
speak
with
them
and
are
replied
to
another
feels
that
someone
his
thoughts
for
him
another
has
two
bodies
lying
in
different
beds
some
patients
feel
as
if
they
had
lost
parts
of
their
bodies
teeth
brain
stomach
etc
in
some
it
is
made
of
wood
glass
butter
etc
in
some
it
does
not
exist
any
longer
or
is
dead
or
is
a
foreign
object
quite
separate
from
the
speaker
self
occasionally
parts
of
the
body
lose
their
connection
for
consciousness
with
the
rest
and
are
treated
as
belonging
to
another
person
and
moved
by
a
hostile
will
thus
the
right
hand
may
fight
with
the
left
as
with
an
enemy
or
the
cries
of
the
patient
himself
are
assigned
to
another
person
with
whom
the
patient
expresses
sympathy
the
literature
of
insanity
is
filled
with
narratives
of
such
illusions
as
these
taine
quotes
from
a
patient
of
krishaber
an
account
of
sufferings
from
which
it
will
be
seen
how
completely
aloof
from
what
is
normal
a
man
experience
may
suddenly
become
after
the
first
or
second
day
it
was
for
some
weeks
impossible
to
observe
or
analyze
myself
the
suffering
angina
pectoris
was
too
overwhelming
it
was
not
till
the
first
days
of
january
that
i
could
give
an
account
to
myself
of
what
i
experienced
here
is
the
first
thing
of
which
i
retain
a
clear
remembrance
i
was
alone
and
already
a
prey
to
permanent
visual
trouble
when
i
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
visual
trouble
infinitely
more
pronounced
objects
grew
small
and
receded
to
infinite
distances
men
and
things
together
i
was
myself
immeasurably
far
away
i
looked
about
me
with
terror
and
astonishment
world
was
escaping
from
i
remarked
at
the
same
time
that
my
voice
was
extremely
far
away
from
me
that
it
sounded
no
longer
as
if
mine
i
struck
the
ground
with
my
foot
and
perceived
its
resistance
but
this
resistance
seemed
illusory
not
that
the
soil
was
soft
but
that
the
weight
of
my
body
was
reduced
to
almost
nothing
i
had
the
feeling
of
being
without
weight
in
addition
to
being
so
distant
objects
appeared
to
me
when
i
spoke
with
anyone
i
saw
him
like
an
image
cut
out
of
paper
with
no
relief
this
sensation
lasted
intermittently
for
two
years
constantly
it
seemed
as
if
my
legs
did
not
belong
to
me
it
was
almost
as
bad
with
my
arms
as
for
my
head
it
seemed
no
longer
to
exist
i
appeared
to
myself
to
act
automatically
by
an
impulsion
foreign
to
myself
there
was
inside
of
me
a
new
being
and
another
part
of
myself
the
old
being
which
took
no
interest
in
the
newcomer
i
distinctly
remember
saying
to
myself
that
the
sufferings
of
this
new
being
were
to
me
indifferent
i
was
never
really
dupe
of
these
illusions
but
my
mind
grew
often
tired
of
incessantly
correcting
the
new
impressions
and
i
let
myself
go
and
live
the
unhappy
life
of
this
new
entity
i
had
an
ardent
desire
to
see
my
old
world
again
to
get
back
to
my
old
self
this
desire
kept
me
from
killing
myself
i
was
another
and
i
hated
i
despised
this
other
he
was
perfectly
odious
to
me
it
was
certainly
another
who
had
taken
my
form
and
assumed
my
functions
in
cases
like
this
it
is
as
certain
that
the
is
unaltered
as
that
the
is
changed
that
is
to
say
the
present
thought
of
the
patient
is
cognitive
of
both
the
old
me
and
the
new
so
long
as
its
memory
holds
good
only
within
that
objective
sphere
which
formerly
lent
itself
so
simply
to
the
judgment
of
recognition
and
of
egoistic
appropriation
strange
perplexities
have
arisen
the
present
and
the
past
both
seen
therein
will
not
unite
where
is
my
old
me
what
is
this
new
one
are
they
the
same
or
have
i
two
such
questions
answered
by
whatever
theory
the
patient
is
able
to
conjure
up
as
plausible
form
the
beginning
of
his
insane
life
Î²
the
phenomenon
of
in
its
simplest
phases
seems
based
on
lapses
of
memory
any
man
becomes
as
we
say
with
himself
if
he
forgets
his
engagements
pledges
knowledges
and
habits
and
it
is
merely
a
question
of
degree
at
what
point
we
shall
say
that
his
personality
is
changed
but
in
the
pathological
cases
known
as
those
of
double
or
alternate
personality
the
loss
of
memory
is
abrupt
and
is
usually
preceded
by
a
period
of
unconsciousness
or
syncope
lasting
a
variable
length
of
time
in
the
hypnotic
trance
we
can
easily
produce
an
alteration
of
the
personality
either
by
telling
the
subject
to
forget
all
that
has
happened
to
him
since
such
or
such
a
date
in
which
case
he
becomes
it
may
be
a
child
again
or
by
telling
him
he
is
another
altogether
imaginary
personage
in
which
case
all
facts
about
himself
seem
for
the
time
being
to
lapse
from
out
his
mind
and
he
throws
himself
into
the
new
character
with
a
vivacity
proportionate
to
the
amount
of
histrionic
imagination
which
he
possesses
but
in
the
pathological
cases
the
transformation
is
spontaneous
the
most
famous
case
perhaps
on
record
is
that
of
fÃ©lida
reported
by
azam
of
bordeaux
at
the
age
of
fourteen
this
woman
began
to
pass
into
a
state
characterized
by
a
change
in
her
general
disposition
and
character
as
if
certain
previously
existing
were
suddenly
removed
during
the
secondary
state
she
remembered
the
first
state
but
on
emerging
from
it
into
the
first
state
she
remembered
nothing
of
the
second
at
the
age
of
the
duration
of
the
secondary
state
which
was
on
the
whole
superior
in
quality
to
the
original
state
had
gained
upon
the
latter
so
much
as
to
occupy
most
of
her
time
during
it
she
remembers
the
events
belonging
to
the
original
state
but
her
complete
oblivion
of
the
secondary
state
when
the
original
state
recurs
is
often
very
distressing
to
her
as
for
example
when
the
transition
takes
place
in
a
carriage
on
her
way
to
a
funeral
and
she
has
no
idea
which
one
of
her
friends
may
be
dead
she
actually
became
pregnant
during
one
of
her
early
secondary
states
and
during
her
first
state
had
no
knowledge
of
how
it
had
come
to
pass
her
distress
at
these
blanks
of
memory
is
sometimes
intense
and
once
drove
her
to
attempt
suicide
pierre
janet
describes
a
still
more
remarkable
case
as
follows
lÃ©onie
whose
life
sounds
more
like
an
improbable
romance
than
a
genuine
history
has
had
attacks
of
natural
somnambulism
since
the
age
of
three
years
she
has
been
hypnotized
constantly
by
all
sorts
of
persons
from
the
age
of
sixteen
upwards
and
she
is
now
whilst
her
normal
life
developed
in
one
way
in
the
midst
of
her
poor
country
surroundings
her
second
life
was
passed
in
and
doctors
offices
and
naturally
took
an
entirely
different
direction
when
in
her
normal
state
this
poor
peasant
woman
is
a
serious
and
rather
sad
person
calm
and
slow
very
mild
with
every
one
and
extremely
timid
to
look
at
her
one
would
never
suspect
the
personage
which
she
contains
but
hardly
is
she
put
to
sleep
hypnotically
when
a
metamorphosis
occurs
her
face
is
no
longer
the
same
she
keeps
her
eyes
closed
it
is
true
but
the
acuteness
of
her
other
senses
supplies
their
place
she
is
gay
noisy
restless
sometimes
insupportably
so
she
remains
but
has
acquired
a
singular
tendency
to
irony
and
sharp
jesting
nothing
is
more
curious
than
to
hear
her
after
a
sitting
when
she
has
received
a
visit
from
strangers
who
wished
to
see
her
asleep
she
gives
a
of
them
apes
their
manners
claims
to
know
their
little
ridiculous
aspects
and
passions
and
for
each
invents
a
romance
to
this
character
must
be
added
the
possession
of
an
enormous
number
of
recollections
whose
existence
she
does
not
even
suspect
when
awake
for
her
amnesia
is
then
complete
she
refuses
the
name
of
lÃ©onie
and
takes
that
of
lÃ©ontine
lÃ©onie
to
which
her
first
magnetizers
had
accustomed
her
good
woman
is
not
myself
she
says
is
too
stupid
to
herself
lÃ©ontine
or
lÃ©onie
she
attributes
all
the
sensations
and
all
the
actions
in
a
word
all
the
conscious
experiences
which
she
has
undergone
and
knits
them
together
to
make
the
history
of
her
already
long
life
to
lÃ©onie
as
janet
calls
the
waking
woman
on
the
other
hand
she
exclusively
ascribes
the
events
lived
through
in
waking
hours
i
was
at
first
struck
by
an
important
exception
to
the
rule
and
was
disposed
to
think
that
there
might
be
something
arbitrary
in
this
partition
of
her
recollections
in
the
normal
state
lÃ©onie
has
a
husband
and
children
but
lÃ©onie
the
somnambulist
whilst
acknowledging
the
children
as
her
own
attributes
the
husband
to
other
this
choice
was
perhaps
explicable
but
it
followed
no
rule
it
was
not
till
later
that
i
learned
that
her
magnetizers
in
early
days
as
audacious
as
certain
hypnotizers
of
recent
date
had
somnambulized
her
for
her
first
and
that
she
had
lapsed
into
that
state
spontaneously
in
the
later
ones
lÃ©onie
was
thus
quite
right
in
ascribing
to
herself
the
children
it
was
she
who
had
had
them
and
the
rule
that
her
first
forms
a
different
personality
was
not
broken
but
it
is
the
same
with
her
second
or
deepest
state
of
trance
when
after
the
renewed
passes
syncope
she
reaches
the
condition
which
i
have
called
lÃ©onie
she
is
another
person
still
serious
and
grave
instead
of
being
a
restless
child
she
speaks
slowly
and
moves
but
little
again
she
separates
herself
from
the
waking
lÃ©onie
good
but
rather
stupid
woman
she
says
not
me
and
she
also
separates
herself
from
lÃ©onie
can
you
see
anything
of
me
in
that
crazy
creature
she
says
i
am
nothing
for
her
Î»
in
or
the
invasion
and
the
passing
away
of
the
secondary
state
are
both
relatively
abrupt
and
the
duration
of
the
state
is
usually
short
from
a
few
minutes
to
a
few
hours
whenever
the
secondary
state
is
well
developed
no
memory
for
aught
that
happened
during
it
remains
after
the
primary
consciousness
comes
back
the
subject
during
the
secondary
consciousness
speaks
writes
or
acts
as
if
animated
by
a
foreign
person
and
often
names
this
foreign
person
and
gives
his
history
in
old
times
the
foreign
was
usually
a
demon
and
is
so
now
in
communities
which
favor
that
belief
with
us
he
gives
himself
out
at
the
worst
for
an
indian
or
other
grotesquely
speaking
but
harmless
personage
usually
he
purports
to
be
the
spirit
of
a
dead
person
known
or
unknown
to
those
present
and
the
subject
is
then
what
we
call
a
mediumistic
possession
in
all
its
grades
seems
to
form
a
perfectly
natural
special
type
of
alternate
personality
and
the
susceptibility
to
it
in
some
form
is
by
no
means
an
uncommon
gift
in
persons
who
have
no
other
obvious
nervous
anomaly
the
phenomena
are
very
intricate
and
are
only
just
beginning
to
be
studied
in
a
proper
scientific
way
the
lowest
phase
of
mediumship
is
automatic
writing
and
the
lowest
grade
of
that
is
where
the
subject
knows
what
words
are
coming
but
feels
impelled
to
write
them
as
if
from
without
then
comes
writing
unconsciously
even
whilst
engaged
in
reading
or
talk
inspirational
speaking
playing
on
musical
instruments
also
belong
to
the
relatively
lower
phases
of
possession
in
which
the
normal
self
is
not
excluded
from
conscious
participation
in
the
performance
though
their
initiative
seems
to
come
from
elsewhere
in
the
highest
phase
the
trance
is
complete
the
voice
language
and
everything
are
changed
and
there
is
no
whatever
until
the
next
trance
comes
one
curious
thing
about
is
their
generic
similarity
in
different
individuals
the
here
in
america
is
either
a
grotesque
slangy
and
flippant
personage
controls
calling
the
ladies
the
men
the
house
a
are
excessively
common
or
if
he
ventures
on
higher
intellectual
flights
he
abounds
in
a
curiously
vague
optimistic
in
which
phrases
about
spirit
harmony
beauty
law
progression
development
keep
recurring
it
seems
exactly
as
if
one
author
composed
more
than
half
of
the
no
matter
by
whom
they
are
uttered
whether
all
selves
are
peculiarly
susceptible
to
a
certain
stratum
of
the
and
get
their
inspiration
from
it
i
know
not
but
this
is
obviously
the
case
with
the
secondary
selves
which
become
in
spiritualist
circles
there
the
beginnings
of
the
medium
trance
are
indistinguishable
from
effects
of
hypnotic
suggestion
the
subject
assumes
the
rÃ´le
of
a
medium
simply
because
opinion
expects
it
of
him
under
the
conditions
which
are
present
and
carries
it
out
with
a
feebleness
or
a
vivacity
proportionate
to
his
histrionic
gifts
but
the
odd
thing
is
that
persons
unexposed
to
spiritualist
traditions
will
so
often
act
in
the
same
way
when
they
become
entranced
speak
in
the
name
of
the
departed
go
through
the
motions
of
their
several
send
messages
about
their
happy
home
in
the
and
describe
the
ailments
of
those
present
i
have
no
theory
to
publish
of
these
cases
the
actual
beginning
of
several
of
which
i
have
personally
seen
i
am
however
persuaded
by
abundant
acquaintance
with
the
trances
of
one
medium
that
the
may
be
altogether
different
from
any
waking
self
of
the
person
in
the
case
i
have
in
mind
it
professes
to
be
a
certain
departed
french
doctor
and
is
i
am
convinced
acquainted
with
facts
about
the
circumstances
and
the
living
and
dead
relatives
and
acquaintances
of
numberless
sitters
whom
the
medium
never
met
before
and
of
whom
she
has
never
heard
the
names
i
record
my
bare
opinion
here
unsupported
by
the
evidence
not
of
course
in
order
to
convert
anyone
to
my
view
but
because
i
am
persuaded
that
a
serious
study
of
these
is
one
of
the
greatest
needs
of
psychology
and
think
that
my
personal
confession
may
possibly
draw
a
reader
or
two
into
a
field
which
the
usually
refuses
to
explore
and
psychological
to
sum
up
this
long
chapter
the
consciousness
of
self
involves
a
stream
of
thought
each
part
of
which
as
can
remember
those
which
went
before
know
the
things
they
knew
and
care
paramountly
for
certain
ones
among
them
as
and
to
the
rest
this
me
is
an
empirical
aggregate
of
things
objectively
known
the
which
knows
them
can
not
itself
be
an
aggregate
neither
for
psychological
purposes
need
it
be
an
unchanging
metaphysical
entity
like
the
soul
or
a
principle
like
the
transcendental
ego
viewed
as
of
time
it
is
a
at
each
moment
different
from
that
of
the
last
moment
but
of
the
latter
together
with
all
that
the
latter
called
its
own
all
the
experiential
facts
find
their
place
in
this
description
unencumbered
with
any
hypothesis
save
that
of
the
existence
of
passing
thoughts
or
states
of
mind
if
passing
thoughts
be
the
directly
verifiable
existents
which
no
school
has
hitherto
doubted
them
to
be
then
they
are
the
only
of
which
psychology
treated
as
a
natural
science
need
take
any
account
the
only
pathway
that
i
can
discover
for
bringing
in
a
more
transcendental
thinker
would
be
to
deny
that
we
have
any
such
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
our
of
consciousness
as
supposes
us
to
possess
the
existence
of
the
in
question
would
then
be
a
mere
hypothesis
or
one
way
of
asserting
that
there
a
knower
correlative
to
all
this
known
but
the
problem
that
knower
would
have
become
a
metaphysical
problem
with
the
question
once
stated
in
these
terms
the
notion
either
of
a
spirit
of
the
world
which
thinks
through
us
or
that
of
a
set
of
individual
substantial
souls
must
be
considered
as
on
a
par
with
our
own
solution
and
discussed
impartially
i
myself
believe
that
room
for
much
future
inquiry
lies
in
this
direction
the
of
mind
which
every
psychologist
believes
in
are
by
no
means
clearly
apprehensible
if
distinguished
from
their
objects
but
to
doubt
them
lies
beyond
the
scope
of
our
see
point
of
view
and
in
this
book
the
provisional
solution
which
we
have
reached
must
be
the
final
word
the
thoughts
themselves
are
the
thinkers
chapter
xiii
attention
narrowness
of
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
facts
of
our
life
is
that
although
we
are
besieged
at
every
moment
by
impressions
from
our
whole
sensory
surface
we
notice
so
very
small
a
part
of
them
the
sum
total
of
our
impressions
never
enters
into
our
consciously
so
called
which
runs
through
this
sum
total
like
a
tiny
rill
through
a
broad
flowery
mead
yet
the
physical
impressions
which
do
not
count
are
as
much
as
those
which
do
and
affect
our
just
as
energetically
why
they
fail
to
pierce
the
mind
is
a
mystery
which
is
only
named
and
not
explained
when
we
invoke
enge
des
narrowness
of
consciousness
as
its
ground
physiological
our
consciousness
certainly
is
narrow
when
contrasted
with
the
breadth
of
our
sensory
surface
and
the
mass
of
incoming
currents
which
are
at
all
times
pouring
in
evidently
no
current
can
be
recorded
in
conscious
experience
unless
it
succeed
in
penetrating
to
the
hemispheres
and
filling
their
pathways
by
the
processes
get
up
when
an
incoming
current
thus
occupies
the
hemispheres
with
its
consequences
other
currents
are
for
the
time
kept
out
they
may
show
their
faces
at
the
door
but
are
turned
back
until
the
actual
possessors
of
the
place
are
tired
physiologically
then
the
narrowness
of
consciousness
seems
to
depend
on
the
fact
that
the
activity
of
the
hemispheres
tends
at
all
times
to
be
a
consolidated
and
unified
affair
determinable
now
by
this
current
and
now
by
that
but
determinable
only
as
a
whole
the
ideas
correlative
to
the
reigning
system
of
processes
are
those
which
are
said
to
us
at
the
time
and
thus
that
selective
character
of
our
attention
on
which
so
much
stress
was
laid
on
pp
ff
appears
to
find
a
physiological
ground
at
all
times
however
there
is
a
liability
to
disintegration
of
the
reigning
system
the
consolidation
is
seldom
quite
complete
the
excluded
currents
are
not
wholly
abortive
their
presence
affects
the
and
margin
of
our
thought
sometimes
indeed
the
normal
consolidation
seems
hardly
to
exist
at
such
moments
it
is
possible
that
cerebral
activity
sinks
to
a
minimum
most
of
us
probably
fall
several
times
a
day
into
a
fit
somewhat
like
this
the
eyes
are
fixed
on
vacancy
the
sounds
of
the
world
melt
into
confused
unity
the
attention
is
dispersed
so
that
the
whole
body
is
felt
as
it
were
at
once
and
the
foreground
of
consciousness
is
filled
if
by
anything
by
a
sort
of
solemn
sense
of
surrender
to
the
empty
passing
of
time
in
the
dim
background
of
our
mind
we
know
meanwhile
what
we
ought
to
be
doing
getting
up
dressing
ourselves
answering
the
person
who
has
spoken
to
us
trying
to
make
the
next
step
in
our
reasoning
but
somehow
we
can
not
the
de
derriÃ¨re
la
fails
to
pierce
the
shell
of
lethargy
that
wraps
our
state
about
every
moment
we
expect
the
spell
to
break
for
we
know
no
reason
why
it
should
continue
but
it
does
continue
pulse
after
pulse
and
we
float
with
it
until
also
without
reason
that
we
can
discover
an
energy
is
given
something
we
know
not
what
enables
us
to
gather
ourselves
together
we
wink
our
eyes
we
shake
our
heads
the
become
effective
and
the
wheels
of
life
go
round
again
this
is
the
extreme
of
what
is
called
dispersed
attention
between
this
extreme
and
the
extreme
of
concentrated
attention
in
which
absorption
in
the
interest
of
the
moment
is
so
complete
that
grave
bodily
injuries
may
be
unfelt
there
are
intermediate
degrees
and
these
have
been
studied
experimentally
the
problem
is
known
as
that
of
span
of
how
many
objects
can
we
attend
to
at
once
when
they
are
not
embraced
in
one
conceptual
system
cattell
experimented
with
combinations
of
letters
exposed
to
the
eye
for
so
short
a
fraction
of
a
second
that
attention
to
them
in
succession
seemed
to
be
ruled
out
when
the
letters
formed
familiar
words
three
times
as
many
of
them
could
be
named
as
when
their
combination
was
meaningless
if
the
words
formed
a
sentence
twice
as
many
could
be
caught
as
when
they
had
no
connection
the
sentence
was
then
apprehended
as
a
whole
if
not
apprehended
thus
almost
nothing
is
apprehended
of
the
several
words
but
if
the
sentence
as
a
whole
is
apprehended
then
the
words
appear
very
distinct
a
word
is
a
conceptual
system
in
which
the
letters
do
not
enter
consciousness
separately
as
they
do
when
apprehended
alone
a
sentence
flashed
at
once
upon
the
eye
is
such
a
system
relatively
to
its
words
a
conceptual
system
may
many
sensible
objects
may
be
translated
later
into
them
but
as
an
actual
existent
mental
state
it
does
not
the
consciousnesses
of
these
objects
when
i
think
of
the
word
as
a
whole
for
instance
what
is
in
my
mind
is
something
different
from
what
is
there
when
i
think
of
the
letters
and
as
so
many
disconnected
data
when
data
are
so
disconnected
that
we
have
no
conception
which
embraces
them
together
it
is
much
harder
to
apprehend
several
of
them
at
once
and
the
mind
tends
to
let
go
of
one
whilst
it
attends
to
another
still
within
limits
this
can
be
avoided
paulhan
has
experimented
on
the
matter
by
declaiming
one
poem
aloud
whilst
he
repeated
a
different
one
mentally
or
by
writing
one
sentence
whilst
speaking
another
or
by
performing
calculations
on
paper
whilst
reciting
poetry
he
found
that
the
most
favorable
condition
for
the
doubling
of
the
mind
was
its
simultaneous
application
to
two
heterogeneous
operations
two
operations
of
the
same
sort
two
multiplications
two
recitations
or
the
reciting
of
one
poem
and
writing
of
another
render
the
process
more
uncertain
and
difficult
paulhan
compared
the
time
occupied
by
the
same
two
operations
done
simultaneously
or
in
succession
and
found
that
there
was
often
a
considerable
gain
of
time
from
doing
them
simultaneously
for
instance
i
multiply
by
the
operation
takes
seconds
the
recitation
of
four
verses
also
takes
seconds
but
the
two
operations
done
at
once
only
take
seconds
so
that
there
is
no
loss
of
time
from
combining
them
if
then
by
the
original
question
how
many
objects
can
we
attend
to
at
once
be
meant
how
many
entirely
disconnected
systems
or
processes
can
go
on
simultaneously
the
answer
is
easily
more
than
one
unless
the
processes
are
very
habitual
but
then
two
or
even
without
very
much
oscillation
of
the
attention
where
however
the
processes
are
less
automatic
as
in
the
story
of
julius
cÃ¦sar
dictating
four
letters
whilst
he
writes
a
fifth
there
must
be
a
rapid
oscillation
of
the
mind
from
one
to
the
next
and
no
consequent
gain
of
time
when
the
things
to
be
attended
to
are
minute
sensations
and
when
the
effort
is
to
be
exact
in
noting
them
it
is
found
that
attention
to
one
interferes
a
good
deal
with
the
perception
of
the
other
a
good
deal
of
fine
work
has
been
done
in
this
field
by
professor
wundt
he
tried
to
note
the
exact
position
on
a
dial
of
a
rapidly
revolving
hand
at
the
moment
when
a
bell
struck
here
were
two
disparate
sensations
one
of
vision
the
other
of
sound
to
be
noted
together
but
it
was
found
that
in
a
long
and
patient
research
the
could
seldom
or
never
be
noted
at
the
exact
moment
when
the
bell
actually
struck
an
earlier
or
a
later
point
were
all
that
could
be
seen
varieties
of
attention
may
be
divided
into
kinds
in
various
ways
it
is
either
to
objects
of
sense
sensorial
attention
or
to
ideal
or
represented
objects
intellectual
attention
it
is
either
immediate
or
derived
immediate
when
the
topic
or
stimulus
is
interesting
in
itself
without
relation
to
anything
else
derived
when
it
owes
its
interest
to
association
with
some
other
immediately
interesting
thing
what
i
call
derived
attention
has
been
named
attention
furthermore
attention
may
be
either
passive
reflex
involuntary
effortless
or
active
and
voluntary
attention
is
always
we
never
make
an
to
attend
to
an
object
except
for
the
sake
of
some
interest
which
the
effort
will
serve
but
both
sensorial
and
intellectual
attention
may
be
either
passive
or
voluntary
in
of
the
sort
the
stimulus
is
either
a
very
intense
voluminous
or
sudden
or
it
is
an
stimulus
a
perception
which
by
reason
of
its
nature
rather
than
its
mere
force
appeals
to
some
one
of
our
congenital
impulses
and
has
a
directly
exciting
quality
in
the
chapter
on
instinct
we
shall
see
how
these
stimuli
differ
from
one
animal
to
another
and
what
most
of
them
are
in
man
strange
things
moving
things
wild
animals
bright
things
pretty
things
metallic
things
words
blows
blood
etc
sensitiveness
to
immediately
exciting
sensorial
stimuli
characterizes
the
attention
of
childhood
and
youth
in
mature
age
we
have
generally
selected
those
stimuli
which
are
connected
with
one
or
more
permanent
interests
and
our
attention
has
grown
irresponsive
to
the
rest
but
childhood
is
characterized
by
great
active
energy
and
has
few
organized
interests
by
which
to
meet
new
impressions
and
decide
whether
they
are
worthy
of
notice
or
not
and
the
consequence
is
that
extreme
mobility
of
the
attention
with
which
we
are
all
familiar
in
children
and
which
makes
of
their
first
lessons
such
chaotic
affairs
any
strong
sensation
whatever
produces
accommodation
of
the
organs
which
perceive
it
and
absolute
oblivion
for
the
time
being
of
the
task
in
hand
this
reflex
and
passive
character
of
the
attention
which
as
a
french
writer
says
makes
the
child
seem
to
belong
less
to
himself
than
to
every
object
which
happens
to
catch
his
notice
is
the
first
thing
which
the
teacher
must
overcome
it
never
is
overcome
in
some
people
whose
work
to
the
end
of
life
gets
done
in
the
interstices
of
their
the
passive
sensorial
attention
is
when
the
impression
without
being
either
strong
or
of
an
instinctively
exciting
nature
is
connected
by
previous
experience
and
education
with
things
that
are
so
these
things
may
be
called
the
of
the
attention
the
impression
draws
an
interest
from
them
or
perhaps
it
even
fuses
into
a
single
complex
object
with
them
the
result
is
that
it
is
brought
into
the
focus
of
the
mind
a
faint
tap
is
not
an
interesting
sound
it
may
well
escape
being
discriminated
from
the
general
rumor
of
the
world
but
when
it
is
a
signal
as
that
of
a
lover

a
bit

in

science
when
its

principles
have
been
so
well
impressed
upon
us
that
we
reproduce
them
mentally
with
perfect
distinctness
and
ease
how
slow
and
uncertain
on
the
other
hand
is
our
learning
of
the
principles
themselves
when
familiarity
with
the
still
more
elementary
percepts
connected
with
the
subject
has
not
given
us
an
adequate
predisposition
apperceptive
attention
may
be
plainly
observed
in
very
small
children
when
hearing
the
speech
of
their
elders
as
yet
unintelligible
to
them
they
suddenly
catch
a
single
known
word
here
and
there
and
repeat
it
to
themselves

even
in

looks
round

we

pronounce
his
name
not
far
removed
is
the
talent
which
display
during
the
hours
of
instruction
of
noticing
every
moment
in
which
the
teacher
tells
a
story
i
remember
classes
in
which
instruction
being
uninteresting
and
discipline
relaxed
a
buzzing
murmur
was
always
to
be
heard
which
invariably
stopped
for
as
long
a
time
as
an
anecdote
lasted
how
could
the
boys
since
they
seemed
to
hear
nothing
notice
when
the
anecdote
began
doubtless
most
of
them
always
heard
something
of
the
teacher
talk
but
most
of
it
had
no
connection
with
their
previous
knowledge
and
occupations
and
therefore
the
separate
words
no
sooner
entered
their
consciousness
than
they
fell
out
of
it
again
but
on
the
other
hand
no
sooner
did
the
words
awaken
old
thoughts
forming
series
with
which
the
new
impression
easily
combined
than
out
of
new
and
old
together
a
total
interest
resulted
which
drove
the
vagrant
ideas
below
the
threshold
of
consciousness
and
brought
for
a
while
settled
attention
into
their
place
intellectual
is
immediate
when
we
follow
in
thought
a
train
of
images
exciting
or
interesting
derived
when
the
images
are
interesting
only
as
means
to
a
remote
end
or
merely
because
they
are
associated
with
something
which
makes
them
dear
the
may
then
form
so
solidly
unified
a
system
and
the
absorption
in
their
object
be
so
deep
as
to
banish
not
only
ordinary
sensations
but
even
the
severest
pain
pascal
wesley
robert
hall
are
said
to
have
had
this
capacity
carpenter
says
of
himself
that
he
has
frequently
begun
a
lecture
whilst
suffering
neuralgic
pain
so
severe
as
to
make
him
apprehend
that
he
would
find
it
impossible
to
proceed
yet
no
sooner
has
he
by
a
determined
effort
fairly
launched
himself
into
the
stream
of
thought
than
he
has
found
himself
continuously
borne
along
without
the
least
distraction
until
the
end
has
come
and
the
attention
has
been
released
when
the
pain
has
recurred
with
a
force
that
has
overmastered
all
resistance
making
him
wonder
how
he
could
have
ever
ceased
to
feel
it
carpenter
speaks
of
launching
himself
by
a
determined
this
characterizes
what
we
called
or
voluntary
it
is
a
feeling
which
everyone
knows
but
which
most
people
would
call
quite
indescribable
we
get
it
in
the
sensorial
sphere
whenever
we
seek
to
catch
an
impression
of
extreme
be
it
of
sight
hearing
taste
smell
or
touch
we
get
it
whenever
we
seek
to
a
sensation
merged
in
a
mass
of
others
that
are
similar
we
get
it
whenever
we
the
of
more
potent
stimuli
and
keep
our
mind
occupied
with
some
object
that
is
naturally
unimpressive
we
get
it
in
the
intellectual
sphere
under
exactly
similar
conditions
as
when
we
strive
to
sharpen
and
make
distinct
an
idea
which
we
but
vaguely
seem
to
have
or
painfully
discriminate
a
shade
of
meaning
from
its
similars
or
resolutely
hold
fast
to
a
thought
so
discordant
with
our
impulses
that
if
left
unaided
it
would
quickly
yield
place
to
images
of
an
exciting
and
impassioned
kind
all
forms
of
attentive
effort
would
be
exercised
at
once
by
one
whom
we
might
suppose
at
a
resolutely
to
listen
to
a
neighbor
giving
him
insipid
and
unwelcome
advice
in
a
low
voice
whilst
all
around
the
guests
were
loudly
laughing
and
talking
about
exciting
and
interesting
things
is
no
such
thing
as
voluntary
attention
sustained
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
at
a
what
is
called
sustained
voluntary
attention
is
a
repetition
of
successive
efforts
which
bring
back
the
topic
to
the
mind
the
topic
once
brought
back
if
a
congenial
one
and
if
its
development
is
interesting
it
engages
the
attention
passively
for
a
time
carpenter
a
moment
back
described
the
stream
of
thought
once
entered
as
him
along
this
passive
interest
may
be
short
or
long
as
soon
as
it
flags
the
attention
is
diverted
by
some
irrelevant
thing
and
then
a
voluntary
effort
may
bring
it
back
to
the
topic
again
and
so
on
under
favorable
conditions
for
hours
together
during
all
this
time
however
note
that
it
is
not
an
identical
in
the
psychological
sense
but
a
succession
of
mutually
related
objects
forming
an
identical
only
upon
which
the
attention
is
fixed
one
can
possibly
attend
continuously
to
an
object
that
does
not
now
there
are
always
some
objects
that
for
the
time
being
not
they
simply
and
to
keep
the
mind
upon
anything
related
to
them
requires
such
incessently
renewed
effort
that
the
most
resolute
will
ere
long
gives
out
and
lets
its
thoughts
follow
the
more
stimulating
solicitations
after
it
has
withstood
them
for
what
length
of
time
it
can
there
are
topics
known
to
every
man
from
which
he
shies
like
a
frightened
horse
and
which
to
get
a
glimpse
of
is
to
shun
such
are
his
ebbing
assets
to
the
spendthrift
in
full
career
but
why
single
out
the
spendthrift
when
to
every
man
actuated
by
passion
the
thought
of
interests
which
negate
the
passion
can
hardly
for
more
than
a
fleeting
instant
stay
before
the
mind
it
is
like
mori
in
the
heydey
of
the
pride
of
life
nature
rises
at
such
suggestions
and
excludes
them
from
the
view
how
long
o
healthy
reader
can
you
now
continue
thinking
of
your
tomb
in
milder
instances
the
difficulty
is
as
great
especially
when
the
brain
is
fagged
one
snatches
at
any
and
every
passing
pretext
no
matter
how
trivial
or
external
to
escape
from
the
odiousness
of
the
matter
in
hand
i
know
a
person
for
example
who
will
poke
the
fire
set
chairs
straight
pick
from
the
floor
arrange
his
table
snatch
up
the
newspaper
take
down
any
book
which
catches
his
eye
trim
his
nails
waste
the
morning
in
short
and
all
without
premeditation
simply
because
the
only
thing
he
to
attend
to
is
the
preparation
of
a
noonday
lesson
in
formal
logic
which
he
detests
anything
but
illustration
fig
once
more
the
object
must
change
when
it
is
one
of
sight
it
will
actually
become
invisible
when
of

inaudible
if
we
attend

it
too
unmovingly
helmholtz
who
has
put
his
sensorial
attention
to
the
severest
tests
by
using
his
eyes
on
objects
which
in
common
life
are
expressly
overlooked
makes
some
interesting
remarks
on
this
point
in
his
section
on
retinal
rivalry
the
phenomenon
called
by
that
name
is
this
that
if
we
look
with
each
eye
upon
a
different
picture
as
in
the
annexed
stereoscopic
slide
sometimes
one
picture
sometimes
the
other
or
parts
of
both
will
come
to
consciousness
but
hardly
ever
both
combined
helmholtz
now
says
i
find
that
i
am
able
to
attend
voluntarily
now
to
one
and
now
to
the
other
system
of
lines
and
that
then
this
system
remains
visible
alone
for
a
certain
time
whilst
the
other
completely
vanishes
this
happens
for
example
whenever
i
try
to
count
the
lines
first
of
one
and
then
of
the
other
system
but
it
is
extremely
hard
to
chain
the
attention
down
to
one
of
the
systems
for
long
unless
we
associate
with
our
looking
some
distinct
purpose
which
keeps
the
activity
of
the
attention
perpetually
renewed
such
a
one
is
counting
the
lines
comparing
their
intervals
or
the
like
an
equilibrium
of
the
attention
persistent
for
any
length
of
time
is
under
no
circumstances
attainable
the
natural
tendency
of
attention
when
left
to
itself
is
to
wander
to
ever
new
things
and
so
soon
as
the
interest
of
its
object
is
over
so
soon
as
nothing
new
is
to
be
noticed
there
it
passes
in
spite
of
our
will
to
something
else
we
wish
to
keep
it
upon
one
and
the
same
object
we
must
seek
constantly
to
find
out
something
new
about
the
especially
if
other
powerful
impressions
are
attracting
us
away
these
words
of
helmholtz
are
of
fundamental
importance
and
if
true
of
sensorial
attention
how
much
more
true
are
they
of
the
intellectual
variety
the
sine
quÃ¢
of
sustained
attention
to
a
given
topic
of
thought
is
that
we
should
roll
it
over
and
over
incessantly
and
consider
different
aspects
and
relations
of
it
in
turn
only
in
pathological
states
will
a
fixed
and
ever
monotonously
recurring
idea
possess
the
mind
and
and
now
we
can
see
why
it
is
that
what
is
called
sustained
attention
is
the
easier
the
richer
in
acquisitions
and
the
fresher
and
more
original
the
mind
in
such
minds
subjects
bud
and
sprout
and
grow
at
every
moment
they
please
by
a
new
consequence
and
rivet
the
attention
afresh
but
an
intellect
unfurnished
with
materials
stagnant
unoriginal
will
hardly
be
likely
to
consider
any
subject
long
a
glance
exhausts
its
possibilities
of
interest
geniuses
are
commonly
believed
to
excel
other
men
in
their
power
of
sustained
attention
in
most
of
them
it
is
to
be
feared
the
is
of
the
passive
sort
their
ideas
coruscate
every
subject
branches
infinitely
before
their
fertile
minds
and
so
for
hours
they
may
be
rapt
it
is
their
genius
making
them
attentive
not
their
attention
making
geniuses
of
and
when
we
come
down
to
the
root
of
the
matter
we
see
that
they
differ
from
ordinary
men
less
in
the
character
of
their
attention
than
in
the
nature
of
the
objects
upon
which
it
is
successively
bestowed
in
the
genius
these
form
a
concatenated
series
suggesting
each
other
mutually
by
some
rational
law
therefore
we
call
the
attention
and
the
topic
of
meditation
for
hours
same
in
the
common
man
the
series
is
for
the
most
part
incoherent
the
objects
have
no
rational
bond
and
we
call
the
attention
wandering
and
unfixed
it
is
probable
that
genius
tends
actually
to
prevent
a
man
from
acquiring
habits
of
voluntary
attention
and
that
moderate
intellectual
endowments
are
the
soil
in
which
we
may
best
expect
here
as
elsewhere
the
virtues
of
the
will
strictly
so
called
to
thrive
but
whether
the
attention
come
by
grace
of
genius
or
by
dint
of
will
the
longer
one
does
attend
to
a
topic
the
more
mastery
of
it
one
has
and
the
faculty
of
voluntarily
bringing
back
a
wandering
attention
over
and
over
again
is
the
very
root
of
judgment
character
and
will
no
one
is
if
he
have
it
not
an
education
which
should
improve
this
faculty
would
be
education
but
it
is
easier
to
define
this
ideal
than
to
give
practical
directions
for
bringing
it
about
the
only
general
pedagogic
maxim
bearing
on
attention
is
that
the
more
interests
the
child
has
in
advance
in
the
subject
the
better
he
will
attend
induct
him
therefore
in
such
a
way
as
to
knit
each
new
thing
on
to
some
acquisition
already
there
and
if
possible
awaken
curiosity
so
that
the
new
thing
shall
seem
to
come
as
an
answer
or
part
of
an
answer
to
a
question
preÃ«xisting
in
his
mind
physiological
conditions
of
these
seem
to
be
the
following
appropriate
cortical
centre
must
be
excited
ideationally
as
well
as
sensorially
before
attention
to
an
object
can
take
must
then
adapt
itself
to
clearest
reception
of
the
object
by
the
adjustment
of
its
muscular
all
probability
a
certain
afflux
of
blood
to
the
cortical
centre
must
of
this
third
condition
i
will
say
no
more
since
we
have
no
proof
of
it
in
detail
and
i
state
it
on
the
faith
of
general
analogies
conditions
and
however
are
verifiable
and
the
best
order
will
be
to
take
the
latter
first
adaptation
of
the
this
occurs
not
only
in
sensorial
but
also
in
intellectual
attention
to
an
object
that
it
is
present
when
we
attend
to
things
is
obvious
when
we
look
or
listen
we
accommodate
our
eyes
and
ears
involuntarily
and
we
turn
our
head
and
body
as
well
when
we
taste
or
smell
we
adjust
the
tongue
lips
and
respiration
to
the
object
in
feeling
a
surface
we
move
the
palpatory
organ
in
a
suitable
way
in
all
these
acts
besides
making
involuntary
muscular
contractions
of
a
positive
sort
we
inhibit
others
which
might
interfere
with
the
result
we
close
the
eyes
in
tasting
suspend
the
respiration
in
listening
etc
the
result
is
a
more
or
less
massive
organic
feeling
that
attention
is
going
on
this
organic
feeling
we
usually
treat
as
part
of
the
sense
of
our
although
it
comes
in
to
us
from
our
organs
after
they
are
accommodated
any
object
then
if
exciting
causes
a
reflex
accommodation
of
the
which
has
two
results
first
the
feeling
of
activity
in
question
and
second
the
object
increase
in
clearness
but
in
attention
similar
feelings
of
activity
occur
fechner
was
the
first
i
believe
to
analyze
these
feelings
and
discriminate
them
from
the
stronger
ones
just
named
he
writes
when
we
transfer
the
attention
from
objects
of
one
sense
to
those
of
another
we
have
an
indescribable
feeling
though
at
the
same
time
one
perfectly
determinate
and
reproducible
at
pleasure
of
altered
or
differently
localized
tension
we
feel
a
strain
forward
in
the
eyes
one
directed
sidewise
in
the
ears
increasing
with
the
degree
of
our
attention
and
changing
according
as
we
look
at
an
object
carefully
or
listen
to
something
attentively
and
we
speak
accordingly
of
the
the
difference
is
most
plainly
felt
when
the
attention
oscillates
rapidly
between
eye
and
ear
and
the
feeling
localizes
itself
with
most
decided
difference
in
regard
to
the
various
according
as
we
wish
to
discriminate
a
thing
delicately
by
touch
taste
or
smell
but
now
i
have
when
i
try
to
vividly
recall
a
picture
of
memory
or
fancy
a
feeling
perfectly
analogous
to
that
which
i
experience
when
i
seek
to
apprehend
a
thing
keenly
by
eye
or
ear
and
this
analogous
feeling
is
very
differently
localized
while
in
sharpest
possible
attention
to
real
objects
as
well
as
to
the
strain
is
plainly
forwards
and
when
the
attention
changes
from
one
sense
to
another
only
alters
its
direction
between
the
several
external
leaving
the
rest
of
the
head
free
from
strain
the
case
is
different
in
memory
or
fancy
for
here
the
feeling
withdraws
entirely
from
the
external
and
seems
rather
to
take
refuge
in
that
part
of
the
head
which
the
brain
fills
if
i
wish
for
example
to
a
place
or
person
it
will
arise
before
me
with
vividness
not
according
as
i
strain
my
attention
forwards
but
rather
in
proportion
as
i
so
to
speak
retract
it
backwards
in
myself
the
retraction
which
is
felt
during
attention
to
ideas
of
memory
seems
to
be
principally
constituted
by
the
feeling
of
an
actual
rolling
outwards
and
upwards
of
the
eyeballs
such
as
occurs
in
sleep
and
is
the
exact
opposite
of
their
behavior
when
we
look
at
a
physical
thing
this
accommodation
of
the
is
not
however
the
process
even
in
sensorial
attention
it
is
a
secondary
result
which
may
be
prevented
from
occurring
as
certain
observations
show
usually
it
is
true
that
no
object
lying
in
the
marginal
portions
of
the
field
of
vision
can
catch
our
attention
without
at
the
same
time
our
eye
that
is
fatally
provoking
such
movements
of
rotation
and
accommodation
as
will
focus
its
image
on
the
fovea
or
point
of
greatest
sensibility
practice
however
enables
us
to
attend
to
a
marginal
object
whilst
keeping
the
eyes
immovable
the
object
under
these
circumstances
never
becomes
perfectly
distinct
the
place
of
its
image
on
the
retina
makes
distinctness
impossible
but
as
anyone
can
satisfy
himself
by
trying
we
become
more
vividly
conscious
of
it
than
we
were
before
the
effort
was
made
teachers
thus
notice
the
acts
of
children
in
the
at
whom
they
appear
not
to
be
looking
women
in
general
train
their
peripheral
visual
attention
more
than
men
helmholtz
states
the
fact
so
strikingly
that
i
will
quote
his
observation
in
full
he
was
trying
to
combine
in
a
single
solid
percept
pairs
of
stereoscopic
pictures
illuminated
instantaneously
by
the
electric
spark
the
pictures
were
in
a
dark
box
which
the
spark
from
time
to
time
lighted
up
and
to
keep
the
eyes
from
wandering
betweenwhiles
a
was
pricked
through
the
middle
of
each
picture
through
which
the
light
of
the
room
came
so
that
each
eye
had
presented
to
it
during
the
dark
intervals
a
single
bright
point
with
parallel
optical
axes
these
points
combined
into
a
single
image
and
the
slightest
movement
of
the
eyeballs
was
betrayed
by
this
image
at
once
becoming
double
helmholtz
now
found
that
simple
linear
figures
could
when
the
eyes
were
thus
kept
immovable
be
perceived
as
solids
at
a
single
flash
of
the
spark
but
when
the
figures
were
complicated
photographs
many
successive
flashes
were
required
to
grasp
their
totality
now
it
is
interesting
he
says
to
find
that
although
we
keep
steadily
fixating
the
and
never
allow
their
combined
image
to
break
into
two
we
can
nevertheless
before
the
spark
comes
keep
our
attention
voluntarily
turned
to
any
particular
portion
we
please
of
the
dark
field
so
as
then
when
the
spark
comes
to
receive
an
impression
only
from
such
parts
of
the
picture
as
lie
in
this
region
in
this
respect
then
our
attention
is
quite
independent
of
the
position
and
accommodation
of
the
eyes
and
of
any
known
alteration
in
these
organs
and
free
to
direct
itself
by
a
conscious
and
voluntary
effort
upon
any
selected
portion
of
a
dark
and
undifferenced
field
of
view
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
observations
for
a
future
theory
of
attention
ideational
excitement
of
the
but
if
the
peripheral
part
of
the
picture
in
this
experiment
be
not
physically
accommodated
for
what
is
meant
by
its
sharing
our
attention
what
happens
when
we
or
the
latter
upon
a
thing
for
which
we
remain
unwilling
to
this
leads
us
to
that
second
feature
in
the
process
the
of
which
we
spoke
effort
to
attend
to
the
marginal
region
of
the
picture
consists
in
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
effort
to
form
as
clear
idea
is
possible
of
what
is
there
the
idea
is
to
come
to
the
help
of
the
sensation
and
make
it
more
distinct
it
may
come
with
effort
and
such
a
mode
of
coming
is
the
remaining
part
of
what
we
know
as
our
attention
under
the
circumstances
let
us
show
how
universally
present
in
our
acts
of
attention
is
this
anticipatory
thinking
of
the
thing
to
which
we
attend
lewes
name
of
seems
the
best
possible
designation
for
this
imagining
of
an
experience
before
it
occurs
it
must
as
a
matter
of
course
be
present
when
the
attention
is
of
the
intellectual
variety
for
the
thing
attended
to
then
nothing
but
an
idea
an
inward
reproduction
or
conception
if
then
we
prove
ideal
construction
of
the
object
to
be
present
in
attention
it
will
be
present
everywhere
when
however
sensorial
attention
is
at
its
height
it
is
impossible
to
tell
how
much
of
the
percept
comes
from
without
and
how
much
from
within
but
if
we
find
that
the
we
make
for
it
always
partly
consists
of
the
creation
of
an
imaginary
duplicate
of
the
object
in
the
mind
that
will
be
enough
to
establish
the
point
in
dispute
in
experiments
keeping
our
mind
intent
upon
the
motion
about
to
be
made
shortens
the
time
this
shortening
we
ascribed
in
chap
viii
to
the
fact
that
the
signal
when
it
comes
finds
the
already
charged
almost
to
the
in
advance
expectant
attention
to
a
reaction
thus
goes
with
of
the
centre
concerned
where
the
impression
to
be
caught
is
very
weak
the
way
not
to
miss
it
is
to
sharpen
our
attention
for
it
by
preliminary
contact
with
it
in
a
stronger
form
helmholtz
says
if
we
wish
to
begin
to
observe
overtones
it
is
advisable
just
before
the
sound
which
is
to
be
analyzed
to
sound
very
softly
the
note
of
which
we
are
in
search
if
you
place
the
resonator
which
corresponds
to
a
certain
overtone
for
example
of
the
sound
against
your
ear
and
then
make
the
note
sound
you
will
hear
much
strengthened
by
the
resonator
this
strengthening
by
the
resonator
can
be
used
to
make
the
naked
ear
attentive
to
the
sound
which
it
is
to
catch
for
when
the
resonator
is
gradually
removed
the
grows
weaker
but
the
attention
once
directed
to
it
holds
it
now
more
easily
fast
and
the
observer
hears
the
tone
now
in
the
natural
unaltered
sound
of
the
note
with
his
unaided
ear
wundt
commenting
on
experiences
of
this
sort
says
that
the
same
thing
is
to
be
noticed
in
weak
or
fugitive
visual
impressions
illuminate
a
drawing
by
electric
sparks
separated
by
considerable
intervals
and
after
the
first
and
often
after
the
second
and
third
spark
hardly
anything
will
be
recognized
but
the
confused
image
is
held
fast
in
memory
each
successive
illumination
completes
it
and
so
at
last
we
attain
to
a
clearer
perception
the
primary
motive
to
this
inward
activity
proceeds
usually
from
the
outer
impression
itself
we
hear
a
sound
in
which
from
certain
associations
we
suspect
a
certain
overtone
the
next
thing
is
to
recall
the
overtone
in
memory
and
finally
we
catch
it
in
the
sound
we
hear
or
perhaps
we
see
some
mineral
substance
we
have
met
before
the
impression
awakens
the
which
again
more
or
less
completely
melts
with
the
impression
itself
different
qualities
of
impression
require
disparate
adaptations
and
we
remark
that
our
feeling
of
the
of
our
inward
attentiveness
increases
with
every
increase
in
the
strength
of
the
impressions
on
whose
perception
we
are
intent
the
natural
way
of
conceiving
all
this
is
under
the
symbolic
form
of
a
played
upon
from
two
directions
whilst
the
object
excites
it
from
without
other
arouse
it
from
within
plenary
energy
of
the
demands
the
of
both
not
when
merely
present
but
when
both
present
and
inwardly
imagined
is
the
object
fully
attended
to
and
perceived
a
few
additional
experiences
will
now
be
perfectly
clear
helmholtz
for
instance
adds
this
observation
concerning
the
stereoscopic
pictures
lit
by
the
electric
spark
in
pictures
he
says
so
simple
that
it
is
relatively
difficult
for
me
to
see
them
double
i
can
succeed
in
seeing
them
double
even
when
the
illumination
is
only
instantaneous
the
moment
i
strive
to
in
a
lively
way
how
they
ought
then
to
the
influence
of
attention
is
here
pure
for
all
are
shut
out
again
writing
of
retinal
rivalry
helmholtz
says
it
is
not
a
trial
of
strength
between
two
sensations
but
depends
on
our
fixing
or
failing
to
fix
the
attention
indeed
there
is
scarcely
any
phenomenon
so
well
fitted
for
the
study
of
the
causes
which
are
capable
of
determining
the
attention
it
is
not
enough
to
form
the
conscious
intention
of
seeing
first
with
one
eye
and
then
with
the
other
must
form
as
clear
a
notion
as
possible
of
what
we
expect
to
see
then
it
will
actually
in
figs
and
where
the
result
is
ambiguous
we
can
make
the
change
from
one
apparent
form
to
the
other
by
imagining
strongly
in
advance
the
form
we
wish
to
see
similarly
in
those
puzzles
where
certain
lines
in
a
picture
form
by
their
combination
an
object
that
has
no
connection
with
what
the
picture
obviously
represents
or
indeed
in
every
case
where
an
object
is
inconspicuous
and
hard
to
discern
from
the
background
we
may
not
be
able
to
see
it
for
a
long
time
but
having
once
seen
it
we
can
attend
to
it
again
whenever
we
like
on
account
of
the
mental
duplicate
of
it
which
our
imagination
now
bears
in
the
meaningless
french
words

lieu
rhÃ´ne

who
can
recognize
immediately
the
english
your
own
canoe
but
who
that
has
once
noticed
the
identity

fail
to
have
it
arrest
his
attention
again
when
watching
for
the
distant
clock

strike
our
mind

so
filled
with
its
image
that
at
every
moment
we
think
we
hear
the

dreaded
sound
so
of
an
awaited
footstep
every
stir
in
the
wood
is
for

pursuers

which
not

in

could

even

and
the
arts
some
one
has
to
come
and
tell
us
what

to
single
out
and
what
effects
to
admire
before
our
Ã¦sthetic
nature
can
to
its
full
extent
and
never
the
wrong
emotion
in
one
of
the
exercises
is
to
make
the
children
see
how
many
features
they
can
point
out
in
such
an
object
as
a
flower
or
a
stuffed
bird
they
readily
name
the
features
they
know
already
such
as

but
they
may
look
for
hours
without
distinguishing
nostrils
claws
scales
until
their
attention
is
called
to
these
details
thereafter
however
they
see
them
every
time
in
short
only
things
which
we
commonly
see
are
those
which
we
and
the
only
things
which
we
preperceive
are
those
which
have
been
labelled
for
us
and
the
labels
stamped
into
our
mind
if
we
lost
our
stock
of
labels
we
should
be
intellectually
lost

first
to
attention
in
who
care
nothing
for
the
subject
they
are
studying
and
let
their
wits
go
the
interest
here
must
be
from
something
that
the
teacher
associates
with
the
task
a
reward
or
a
punishment
if
nothing
less
internal
comes
to
mind
if
a
topic
awakens
no
spontaneous
attention
it
must
borrow
an
interest
from
elsewhere
but
the
best
interest
is
internal
and
we
must
always
try
in
teaching
a
class
to
knit
our
novelties
by
rational
links
on
to
things
of
which
they
already
have
preperceptions
the
old
and

readily
attended

for

which
at
a

age
may
trouble
us
reading

listening
to
a

attention
be
the
reproduction
of
the
sensation
from
within
the
habit
of
reading
not
merely
with
the
eye
and
of
listening
not
merely
with
the
ear
but
of
articulating
to
one
self
the
words
seen
or
heard
ought
to
deepen
one
attention
to
the
latter
experience
shows
that
this
is
the
case
i
can
keep
my
wandering
mind
a
great
deal
more
closely
upon
a
conversation
or
a
lecture
if
i
actively
to
myself
the
words
than
if
i
simply
hear
them
and
i
find
a
number
of
my
students
who
report
benefit
from
voluntarily
adopting
a
similar
course
and
free
i
have
spoken
as
if
our
attention
were
wholly
determined
by
neural
conditions
i
believe
that
the
array
of
we
can
attend
to
is
so
determined
no
object
can
our
attention
except
by
the
neural
machinery
but
the
of
the
attention
which
an
object
receives
after
it
has
caught
our
mental
eye
is
another
question
it
often
takes
effort
to
keep
the
mind
upon
it
we
feel
that
we
can
make
more
or
less
of
the
effort
as
we
choose
if
this
feeling
be
not
deceptive
if
our
effort
be
a
spiritual
force
and
an
indeterminate
one
then
of
course
it
contributes
coequally
with
the
cerebral
conditions
to
the
result
though
it
no
new
idea
it
will
deepen
and
prolong
the
stay
in
consciousness
of
innumerable
ideas
which
else
would
fade
more
quickly
away
the
delay
thus
gained
might
not
be
more
than
a
second
in
duration
but
that
second
may
be
for
in
the
constant
rising
and
falling
of
considerations
in
the
mind
where
two
associated
systems
of
them
are
nearly
in
equilibrium
it
is
often
a
matter
of
but
a
second
more
or
less
of
attention
at
the
outset
whether
one
system
shall
gain
force
to
occupy
the
field
and
develop
itself
and
exclude
the
other
or
be
excluded
itself
by
the
other
when
developed
it
may
make
us
act
and
that
act
may
seal
our
doom
when
we
come
to
the
chapter
on
the
will
we
shall
see
that
the
whole
drama
of
the
voluntary
life
hinges
on
the
amount
of
attention
slightly
more
or
slightly
less
which
rival
motor
ideas
may
receive
but
the
whole
feeling
of
reality
the
whole
sting
and
excitement
of
our
voluntary
life
depends
on
our
sense
that
in
it
things
are
being
from
one
moment
to
another
and
that
it
is
not
the
dull
rattling
off
of
a
chain
that
was
forged
innumerable
ages
ago
this
appearance
which
makes
life
and
history
tingle
with
such
a
tragic
zest
not
be
an
illusion
effort
may
be
an
original
force
and
not
a
mere
effect
and
it
may
be
indeterminate
in
amount
the
last
word
of
sober
insight
here
is
ignorance
for
the
forces
engaged
are
too
delicate
ever
to
be
measured
in
detail
psychology
however
as
a
must
like
every
other
science
complete
determinism
in
its
facts
and
abstract
consequently
from
the
effects
of
free
will
even
if
such
a
force
exist
i
shall
do
so
in
this
book
like
other
psychologists
well
knowing
however
that
such
a
procedure
although
a
methodical
device
justified
by
the
subjective
need
of
arranging
the
facts
in
a
simple
and
form
does
not
settle
the
ultimate
truth
of
the
question
one
way
or
the
other
chapter
xiv
conception
states
of
mind
can
mean
the
the
function
by
which
we
mark
off
discriminate
draw
a
line
round
and
identify
a
numerically
distinct
subject
of
discourse
is
called
it
is
plain
that
whenever
one
and
the
same
mental
state
thinks
of
many
things
it
must
be
the
vehicle
of
many
conceptions
if
it
has
such
a
multiple
conceptual
function
it
may
be
called
a
state
of
compound
conception
we
may
conceive
realities
supposed
to
be
as
fictions
as
mermaid
or
mere
like
difference
or
nonentity
but
whatever
we
do
conceive
our
conception
is
of
that
and
nothing
else
nothing
else
that
is
of
that
though
it
may
be
of
much
else
to
that
each
act
of
conception
results
from
our
attention
having
singled
out
some
one
part
of
the
mass
of
which
the
world
presents
and
from
our
holding
fast
to
it
without
confusion
confusion
occurs
when
we
do
not
know
whether
a
certain
object
proposed
to
us
is
with
one
of
our
meanings
or
not
so
that
the
conceptual
function
requires
to
be
complete
that
the
thought
should
not
only
say
mean
this
but
also
say
do
mean
that
each
conception
thus
eternally
remains
what
it
is
and
never
can
become
another
the
mind
may
change
its
states
and
its
meanings
at
different
times
may
drop
one
conception
and
take
up
another
but
the
dropped
conception
itself
can
in
no
intelligible
sense
be
said
to
its
successor
the
paper
a
moment
ago
white
i
may
now
see
to
be
scorched
black
but
my
does
not
change
into
my
on
the
contrary
it
stays
alongside
of
the
objective
blackness
as
a
different
meaning
in
my
mind
and
by
so
doing
lets
me
judge
the
blackness
as
the
paper
change
unless
it
stayed
i
should
simply
say
and
know
no
more
thus
amid
the
flux
of
opinions
and
of
physical
things
the
world
of
conceptions
or
things
intended
to
be
thought
about
stands
stiff
and
immutable
like
realm
of
ideas
some
conceptions
are
of
things
some
of
events
some
of
qualities
any
fact
be
it
thing
event
or
quality
may
be
conceived
sufficiently
for
purposes
of
identification
if
only
it
be
singled
out
and
marked
so
as
to
separate
it
from
other
things
simply
calling
it
or
will
suffice
to
speak
in
technical
language
a
subject
may
be
conceived
by
its
with
no
or
a
very
minimum
of
connotation
attached
the
essential
point
is
that
it
should
be
by
us
as
that
which
the
talk
is
about
and
no
full
representation
of
it
is
necessary
for
this
even
when
it
is
a
fully
representable
thing
in
this
sense
creatures
extremely
low
in
the
intellectual
scale
may
have
conception
all
that
is
required
is
that
they
should
recognize
the
same
experience
again
a
polyp
would
be
a
conceptual
thinker
if
a
feeling
of
thingumbob
again
ever
flitted
through
its
mind
this
sense
of
sameness
is
the
very
keel
and
backbone
of
our
consciousness
the
same
matters
can
be
thought
of
in
different
states
of
mind
and
some
of
these
states
can
know
that
they
mean
the
same
matters
which
the
other
states
meant
in
other
words
mind
can
always
intend
and
know
when
it
intends
to
think
the
of
abstract
of
universal
and
of
problematic
the
sense
of
our
meaning
is
an
entirely
peculiar
element
of
the
thought
it
is
one
of
those
evanescent
and
facts
of
mind
which
introspection
can
not
turn
round
upon
and
isolate
and
hold
up
for
examination
as
an
entomologist
passes
round
an
insect
on
a
pin
in
the
somewhat
clumsy
terminology
i
have
used
it
has
to
do
with
the
of
the
object
and
is
a
of
tendency
whose
neural
counterpart
is
undoubtedly
a
lot
of
dawning
and
dying
processes
too
faint
and
complex
to
be
traced
see
p
the
geometer
with
his
one
definite
figure
before
him
knows
perfectly
that
his
thoughts
apply
to
countless
other
figures
as
well
and
that
although
he
lines
of
a
certain
special
bigness
direction
color
he
not
one
of
these
details
when
i
use
the
word
in
two
different
sentences
i
may
have
both
times
exactly
the
same
sound
upon
my
lips
and
the
same
picture
in
my
mental
eye
but
i
may
mean
and
at
the
very
moment
of
uttering
the
word
and
imagining
the
picture
know
that
i
mean
two
entirely
different
things
thus
when
i
say
what
a
wonderful
man
jones
is
i
am
perfectly
aware
that
i
mean
by
man
to
exclude
napoleon
bonaparte
or
smith
but
when
i
say
what
a
wonderful
thing
man
is
i
am
equally
well
aware
that
i
mean
no
such
exclusion
this
added
consciousness
is
an
absolutely
positive
sort
of
feeling
transforming
what
would
otherwise
be
mere
noise
or
vision
into
something
and
determining
the
sequel
of
my
thinking
the
later
words
and
images
in
a
perfectly
definite
way
no
matter
how
definite
and
concrete
the
habitual
imagery
of
a
given
mind
may
be
the
things
represented
appear
always
surrounded
by
their
fringe
of
relations
and
this
is
as
integral
a
part
of
the
mind
object
as
the
things
themselves
are
we
come
by
steps
with
which
everyone
is
sufficiently
familiar
to
think
of
whole
classes
of
things
as
well
as
of
single
specimens
and
to
think
of
the
special
qualities
or
attributes
of
things
as
well
as
of
the
complete
things
in
other
words
we
come
to
have
and
as
the
logicians
call
them
for
our
objects
we
also
come
to
think
of
objects
which
are
only
or
not
yet
definitely
representable
as
well
as
of
objects
imagined
in
all
their
details
an
object
which
is
problematic
is
defined
by
its
relations
only
we
think
of
a
thing
which
certain
facts
must
obtain
but
we
do
not
yet
know
how
the
thing
will
look
when
realized
that
is
although
conceiving
it
we
can
not
it
we
have
in
the
relations
however
enough
to
individualize
our
topic
and
distinguish
it
from
all
the
other
meanings
of
our
mind
thus
for
example
we
may
conceive
of
a
machine
such
a
machine
is
a
of
a
perfectly
definite
kind
we
can
always
tell
whether
the
actual
machines
offered
us
do
or
do
not
agree
with
what
we
mean
by
it
the
natural
possibility
or
impossibility
of
the
thing
never
touches
the
question
of
its
conceivability
in
this
problematic
way
again
or
are
absolutely
definite
conceptions
it
is
a
mere
accident
as
far
as
conception
goes
that
they
happen
to
stand
for
things
which
nature
never
shows
us
and
of
which
we
consequently
can
make
no
picture
the
nominalists
and
conceptualists
carry
on
a
great
quarrel
over
the
question
whether
the
mind
can
frame
abstract
or
universal
ideas
ideas
it
should
be
said
of
abstract
or
universal
objects
but
truly
in
comparison
with
the
wonderful
fact
that
our
thoughts
however
different
otherwise
can
still
be
of
the
question
whether
that
same
be
a
single
thing
a
whole
class
of
things
an
abstract
quality
or
something
unimaginable
is
an
insignificant
matter
of
detail
our
meanings
are
of
singulars
particulars
indefinites
problematics
and
universals
mixed
together
in
every
way
a
singular
individual
is
as
much
when
he
is
isolated
and
identified
away
from
the
rest
of
the
world
in
my
mind
as
is
the
most
rarefied
and
universally
applicable
quality
he
may
possess
for
example
when
treated
in
the
same
way
from
every
point
of
view
the
overwhelming
and
portentous
character
ascribed
to
universal
conceptions
is
surprising
why
from
socrates
downwards
philosophers
should
have
vied
with
each
other
in
scorn
of
the
knowledge
of
the
particular
and
in
adoration
of
that
of
the
general
is
hard
to
understand
seeing
that
the
more
adorable
knowledge
ought
to
be
that
of
the
more
adorable
things
and
that
the
of
worth
are
all
concretes
and
singulars
the
only
value
of
universal
characters
is
that
they
help
us
by
reasoning
to
know
new
truths
about
individual
things
the
restriction
of
one
meaning
moreover
to
an
individual
thing
probably
requires
even
more
complicated
than
its
extension
to
all
the
instances
of
a
kind
and
the
mere
mystery
as
such
of
the
knowledge
is
equally
great
whether
generals
or
singulars
be
the
things
known
in
sum
therefore
the
traditional
can
only
be
called
a
bit
of
perverse
sentimentalism
a
philosophic
of
the
cave
can
be
conceived
as
the
same
without
being
conceived
in
a
novel
state
of
it
seems
hardly
necessary
to
add
this
after
what
was
said
on
thus
my
is
one
of
the
things
of
which
i
have
a
conception
i
knew
it
yesterday
and
recognized
it
when
i
looked
at
it
but
if
i
think
of
it
as
the
same
which
i
looked
at
yesterday
it
is
obvious
that
the
very
conception
of
it
the
same
is
an
additional
complication
to
the
thought
whose
inward
constitution
must
alter
in
consequence
in
short
it
is
logically
impossible
that
the
same
thing
should
be
as
the
by
two
successive
copies
of
the
same
thought
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
thoughts
by
which
we
know
that
we
mean
the
same
thing
are
apt
to
be
very
different
indeed
from
each
other
we
think
the
thing
now
substantively
now
transitively
now
in
a
direct
image
now
in
one
symbol
and
now
in
another
symbol
but
nevertheless
we
somehow
always
know
which
of
all
possible
subjects
we
have
in
mind
introspective
psychology
must
here
throw
up
the
sponge
the
fluctuations
of
subjective
life
are
too
exquisite
to
be
described
by
its
coarse
terms
it
must
confine
itself
to
bearing
witness
to
the
fact
that
all
sorts
of
different
subjective
states
do
form
the
vehicle
by
which
the
same
is
known
and
it
must
contradict
the
opposite
view
chapter
xv
discrimination
versus
on
i
spoke
of
the
baby
first
object
being
the
germ
out
of
which
his
whole
later
universe
develops
by
the
addition
of
new
parts
from
without
and
the
discrimination
of
others
within
experience
in
other
words
is
trained
by
association
and
dissociation
and
psychology
must
be
writ
in
synthetic
and
in
analytic
terms
our
original
sensible
totals
are
on
the
one
hand
subdivided
by
discriminative
attention
and
on
the
other
united
with
other
totals
either
through
the
agency
of
our
own
movements
carrying
our
senses
from
one
part
of
space
to
another
or
because
new
objects
come
successively
and
replace
those
by
which
we
were
at
first
impressed
the
impression
of
hume
the
idea
of
locke
are
abstractions
never
realized
in
experience
life
from
the
very
first
presents
us
with
concreted
objects
vaguely
continuous
with
the
rest
of
the
world
which
envelops
them
in
space
and
time
and
potentially
divisible
into
inward
elements
and
parts
these
objects
we
break
asunder
and
reunite
we
must
do
both
for
our
knowledge
of
them
to
grow
and
it
is
hard
to
say
on
the
whole
which
we
do
most
but
since
the
elements
with
which
the
traditional
associationism
performs
its
constructions
sensations
namely
are
all
products
of
discrimination
carried
to
a
high
pitch
it
seems
as
if
we
ought
to
discuss
the
subject
of
analytic
attention
and
discrimination
first
the
noticing
of
any
whatever
of
our
object
is
an
act
of
discrimination
already
on
i
have
described
the
manner
in
which
we
often
spontaneously
lapse
into
the
undiscriminating
state
even
with
regard
to
objects
which
we
have
already
learned
to
distinguish
such
anÃ¦sthetics
as
chloroform
nitrous
oxide
sometimes
bring
about
transient
lapses
even
more
total
in
which
numerical
discrimination
especially
seems
gone
for
one
sees
light
and
hears
sound
but
whether
one
or
many
lights
and
sounds
is
quite
impossible
to
tell
where
the
parts
of
an
object
have
already
been
discerned
and
each
made
the
object
of
a
special
discriminative
act
we
can
with
difficulty
feel
the
object
again
in
its
pristine
unity
and
so
prominent
may
our
consciousness
of
its
composition
be
that
we
may
hardly
believe
that
it
ever
could
have
appeared
undivided
but
this
is
an
erroneous
view
the
undeniable
fact
being
that
number
of
impressions
from
any
number
of
sensory
sources
falling
simultaneously
on
a
which
has
not
yet
experienced
them
separately
yield
a
single
undivided
object
to
that
the
law
is
that
all
things
fuse
that
fuse
and
that
nothing
separates
except
what
must
what
makes
impressions
separate
is
what
we
have
to
study
in
this
chapter
which
favor
i
will
treat
successively
of
differences
so
far
as
they
are
directly
so
far
as
they
are
so
far
as
they
are
out
in
directly
the
first
condition
is
that
things
to
be
discriminated
be
either
in
time
place
or
quality
in
other
words
and
physiologically
speaking
they
must
awaken
neural
processes
which
are
but
this
as
we
have
just
seen
though
an
indispensable
condition
is
not
a
sufficient
condition
to
begin
with
the
several
neural
processes
must
be
distinct
no
one
can
help
singling
out
a
black
stripe
on
a
white
ground
or
feeling
the
contrast
between
a
bass
note
and
a
high
one
sounded
immediately
after
it
discrimination
is
here
but
where
the
objective
difference
is
less
discrimination
may
require
considerable
effort
of
attention
to
be
performed
at
all
secondly
sensations
excited
by
the
differing
objects
must
not
fall
simultaneously
but
must
fall
in
succession
upon
the
same
organ
it
is
easier
to
compare
successive
than
simultaneous
sounds
easier
to
compare
two
weights
or
two
temperatures
by
testing
one
after
the
other
with
the
same
hand
than
by
using
both
hands
and
comparing
both
at
once
similarly
it
is
easier
to
discriminate
shades
of
light
or
color
by
moving
the
eye
from
one
to
the
other
so
that
they
successively
stimulate
the
same
retinal
tract
in
testing
the
local
discrimination
of
the
skin
by
applying
it
is
found
that
they
are
felt
to
touch
different
spots
much
more
readily
when
set
down
one
after
the
other
than
when
both
are
applied
at
once
in
the
latter
case
they
may
be
two
or
three
inches
apart
on
the
back
thighs
and
still
feel
as
if
they
were
set
down
in
one
spot
finally
in
the
case
of
smell
and
taste
it
is
impossible
to
compare
simultaneous
impressions
at
all
the
reason
why
successive
impression
so
much
favors
the
result
seems
to
be
that
there
is
a
real
of
aroused
by
the
shock
of
transition
from
one
perception
to
another
which
is
unlike
the
first
this
sensation
of
difference
has
its
own
peculiar
quality
no
matter
what
the
terms
may
be
between
which
it
obtains
it
is
in
short
one
of
those
transitive
feelings
or
feelings
of
relation
of
which
i
treated
in
a
former
place
and
when
once
aroused
its
object
lingers
in
the
memory
along
with
the
substantive
terms
which
precede
and
follow
and
enables
our
of
to
be
made
where
the
difference
between
the
successive
sensations
is
but
slight
the
transition
between
them
must
be
made
as
immediate
as
possible
and
both
must
be
compared
in
order
to
get
the
best
results
one
can
not
judge
accurately
of
the
difference
between
two
similar
wines
whilst
the
second
is
still
in
one
mouth
so
of
sounds
warmths
we
must
get
the
dying
phases
of
both
sensations
of
the
pair
we
are
comparing
where
however
the
difference
is
strong
this
condition
is
immaterial
and
we
can
then
compare
a
sensation
actually
felt
with
another
carried
in
memory
only
the
longer
the
interval
of
time
between
the
sensations
the
more
uncertain
is
their
discrimination
the
difference
thus
immediately
felt
between
two
terms
is
independent
of
our
ability
to
say
anything
either
of
the
terms
by
itself
i
can
feel
two
distinct
spots
to
be
touched
on
my
skin
yet
not
know
which
is
above
and
which
below
i
can
observe
two
neighboring
musical
tones
to
differ
and
still
not
know
which
of
the
two
is
the
higher
in
pitch
similarly
i
may
discriminate
two
neighboring
tints
whilst
remaining
uncertain
which
is
the
bluer
or
the
yellower
or
either
differs
from
its
mate
i
said
that
in
the
immediate
succession
of
upon
the
shock
of
their
difference
is
it
is
felt
when
we
go
back
and
forth
from
to
and
we
make
a
point
of
getting
it
thus
repeatedly
by
alternating
our
attention
at
least
whenever
the
shock
is
so
slight
as
to
be
with
difficulty
perceived
but
in
addition
to
being
felt
at
the
brief
instant
of
transition
the
difference
also
feels
as
if
incorporated
and
taken
up
into
the
second
term
which
feels
even
while
it
lasts
it
is
obvious
that
the
term
of
the
mind
in
this
case
is
not
bald
but
a
very
complex
object
and
that
the
sequence
is
not
simply
first
then
then
but
first
then
then
the
first
and
third
states
of
mind
are
substantive
the
second
transitive
as
our
brains
and
minds
are
actually
made
it
is
impossible
to
get
certain
and
in
immediate
sequence
and
to
keep
them
if
kept
pure
it
would
mean
that
they
remained
uncompared
with
us
inevitably
by
a
mechanism
which
we
as
yet
fail
to
understand
the
shock
of
difference
is
felt
between
them
and
the
second
object
is
not
pure
but
the
pure
idea
of
is
in
the
mind
at
when
has
gone
before
with
such
direct
perceptions
of
difference
as
this
we
must
not
confound
those
entirely
unlike
cases
in
which
we
that
two
things
must
differ
because
we
know
enough
each
of
them
taken
by
itself
to
warrant
our
classing
them
under
distinct
heads
it
often
happens
when
the
interval
is
long
between
two
experiences
that
our
judgments
are
guided
not
so
much
by
a
positive
image
or
copy
of
the
earlier
one
as
by
our
recollection
of
certain
facts
about
it
thus
i
know
that
the
sunshine
is
less
bright
than
on
a
certain
day
last
week
because
i
then
said
it
was
quite
dazzling
a
remark
i
should
not
now
care
to
make
or
i
know
myself
to
feel
livelier
now
than
i
did
last
summer
because
i
can
now
psychologize
and
then
i
could
not
we
are
constantly
comparing
feelings
with
whose
quality
our
imagination
has
no
sort
of
at
the
time
pleasures
or
pains
for
example
it
is
notoriously
hard
to
conjure
up
in
imagination
a
lively
image
of
either
of
these
classes
of
feeling
the
associationists
may
prate
of
an
idea
of
pleasure
being
a
pleasant
idea
of
an
idea
of
pain
being
a
painful
one
but
the
unsophisticated
sense
of
mankind
is
against
them
agreeing
with
homer
that
the
memory
of
griefs
when
past
may
be
a
joy
and
with
dante
that
there
is
no
greater
sorrow
than
in
misery
to
recollect
one
happier
time
out
of
elements
in
a
it
is
safe
to
lay
it
down
as
a
fundamental
principle
that
total
impression
made
on
the
mind
must
be
unanalyzable
so
long
as
its
elements
have
never
been
experienced
apart
or
in
other
combinations
the
components
of
an
absolutely
changeless
group
of
attributes
could
never
be
discriminated
if
all
cold
things
were
wet
and
all
wet
things
cold
if
all
hard
things
pricked
our
skin
and
no
other
things
did
so
is
it
likely
that
we
should
discriminate
between
coldness
and
wetness
and
hardness
and
pungency
respectively
if
all
liquids
were
transparent
and
no
were
transparent
it
would
be
long
before
we
had
separate
names
for
liquidity
and
transparency
if
heat
were
a
function
of
position
above
the
earth
surface
so
that
the
higher
a
thing
was
the
hotter
it
became
one
word
would
serve
for
hot
and
high
we
have
in
fact
a
number
of
sensations
whose
concomitants
are
invariably
the
same
and
we
find
it
accordingly
impossible
to
analyze
them
out
from
the
totals
in
which
they
are
found
the
contraction
of
the
diaphragm
and
the
expansion
of
the
lungs
the
shortening
of
certain
muscles
and
the
rotation
of
certain
joints
are
examples
we
learn
that
the
of
such
groups
of
feelings
are
multiple
and
therefore
we
frame
theories
about
the
composition
of
the
feelings
themselves
by
or
what
not
but
by
direct
introspection
no
analysis
of
the
feelings
is
ever
made
a
conspicuous
case
will
come
to
view
when
we
treat
of
the
emotions
every
emotion
has
its
of
quick
breathing
palpitating
heart
flushed
face
or
the
like
the
expression
gives
rise
to
bodily
feelings
and
the
emotion
is
thus
necessarily
and
invariably
accompanied
by
these
bodily
feelings
the
consequence
is
that
it
is
impossible
to
apprehend
it
as
a
spiritual
state
by
itself
or
to
analyze
it
away
from
the
lower
feelings
in
question
it
is
in
fact
impossible
to
prove
that
it
exists
as
a
distinct
psychic
fact
the
present
writer
strongly
doubts
that
it
does
so
exist
in
general
then
if
an
object
affects
us
simultaneously
in
a
number
of
ways
we
get
a
peculiar
integral
impression
which
thereafter
characterizes
to
our
mind
the
individuality
of
that
object
and
becomes
the
sign
of
its
presence
and
which
is
only
resolved
into
and
respectively
by
the
aid
of
farther
experiences
these
we
now
may
turn
to
consider
any
single
quality
or
constituent
a
of
such
an
object
have
previously
been
known
by
us
or
have
in
any
other
manner
already
become
an
object
of
separate
acquaintance
on
our
part
so
that
we
have
an
image
of
it
distinct
or
vague
in
our
mind
disconnected
with
then
that
constituent
a
may
be
analyzed
out
from
the
total
analysis
of
a
thing
means
separate
attention
to
each
of
its
parts
in
chapter
xiii
we
saw
that
one
condition
of
attending
to
a
thing
was
the
formation
from
within
of
a
separate
image
of
that
thing
which
should
as
it
were
go
out
to
meet
the
impression
received
attention
being
the
condition
of
analysis
and
separate
imagination
being
the
condition
of
attention
it
follows
also
that
separate
imagination
is
the
condition
of
analysis
such
elements
as
we
are
acquainted
with
and
can
imagine
separately
can
be
discriminated
within
a
total
the
image
seems
to
welcome
its
own
mate
from
out
of
the
compound
and
to
separate
it
from
the
other
constituents
and
thus
the
compound
becomes
broken
for
our
consciousness
into
parts
all
the
facts
cited
in
chapter
xiii
to
prove
that
attention
involves
inward
reproduction
prove
that
discrimination
involves
it
as
well
in
looking
for
any
object
in
a
room
for
a
book
in
a
library
for
example
we
detect
it
the
more
readily
if
in
addition
to
merely
knowing
its
name
we
carry
in
our
mind
a
distinct
image
of
its
appearance
the
assafÅdita
in
sauce
is
not
obvious
to
anyone
who
has
not
tasted
assafÅtida
in
a
color
an
artist
would
never
be
able
to
analyze
out
the
pervasive
presence
of
unless
he
had
previously
made
acquaintance
with
the
color
blue
by
itself
all
the
colors
we
actually
experience
are
mixtures
even
the
purest
primaries
always
come
to
us
with
some
white
absolutely
pure
red
or
green
or
violet
is
never
experienced
and
so
can
never
be
discerned
in
the
primaries
with
which
we
have
to
deal
the
latter
consequently
pass
for
the
reader
will
remember
how
an
overtone
can
only
be
attended
to
in
the
midst
of
its
consorts
in
the
voice
of
a
musical
instrument
by
sounding
it
previously
alone
the
imagination
being
then
full
of
it
hears
the
like
of
it
in
the
compound
tone
elements
may
be
discriminated
concomitants
very
few
elements
of
reality
are
experienced
by
us
in
absolute
isolation
the
most
that
usually
happens
to
a
constituent
of
a
compound
phenomenon
is
that
its
relatively
to
varies
from
a
maximum
to
a
minimum
or
that
it
appears
linked
with
qualities
in
other
compounds
as
or
either
of
these
vicissitudes
in
the
mode
of
our
experiencing
may
under
favorable
circumstances
lead
us
to
feel
the
difference
between
it
and
its
concomitants
and
to
single
it
out
not
absolutely
it
is
true
but
approximately
and
so
to
analyze
the
compound
of
which
it
is
a
part
the
act
of
singling
out
is
then
called
and
the
element
disengaged
is
an
fluctuation
in
a
quality
intensity
is
a
less
efficient
aid
to
our
abstracting
of
it
than
variety
in
the
combinations
in
which
it
appears
is
associated
now
with
one
thing
and
now
with
another
tends
to
become
dissociated
from
either
and
to
grow
into
an
object
of
abstract
contemplation
by
the
one
might
call
this
the
of
dissociation
by
varying
the
practical
result
of
this
law
is
that
a
mind
which
has
once
dissociated
and
abstracted
a
character
by
its
means
can
analyze
it
out
of
a
total
whenever
it
meets
with
it
again
martineau
gives
a
good
example
of
the
law
when
a
red
ivory
ball
seen
for
the
first
time
has
been
withdrawn
it
will
leave
a
mental
representation
of
itself
in
which
all
that
it
simultaneously
gave
us
will
indistinguishably
coexist
let
a
white
ball
succeed
to
it
now
and
not
before
will
an
attribute
detach
itself
and
the
by
force
of
contrast
be
shaken
out
into
the
foreground
let
the
white
ball
be
replaced
by
an
egg
and
this
new
difference
will
bring
the
into
notice
from
its
previous
slumber
and
thus
that
which
began
by
being
simply
an
object
cut
out
from
the
surrounding
scene
becomes
for
us
first
a
object
then
a
object
and
so
on
the
repetition
of
the
character
in
combination
with
different
wholes
will
cause
it
thus
to
break
up
its
adhesion
with
any
one
of
them
and
roll
out
as
it
were
alone
upon
the
table
of
consciousness
is
a
little
of
a
mystery
but
one
which
need
not
be
considered
here
improves
any
personal
or
practical
interest
in
the
results
to
be
obtained
by
distinguishing
makes
one
wits
amazingly
sharp
to
detect
differences
and
long
training
and
practice
in
distinguishing
has
the
same
effect
as
personal
interest
both
of
these
agencies
give
to
small
amounts
of
objective
difference
the
same
effectiveness
upon
the
mind
that
under
other
circumstances
only
large
ones
would
have

perfect

notorious
in
the
field
of
motor
accomplishments
but
motor
accomplishments
depend
in
part
on
sensory
discrimination
demand
the
most
delicate
appreciation
of
minute
disparities
of

as
well
as
the
power
to
make
accurately
graduated
muscular
response
thereto
in

purely
sensorial

we
have
the
virtuosity
displayed
by

one

educated

the
fact
is
so
familiar
that
few

any
psychologists
have
even
recognized
it
as
needing
explanation
they
have
seemed
to
think
that
practice
must
in
the
nature
of
things
improve
the
delicacy
of
discernment

have
let
the

rest

attention
accounts
for

we
attend
more
to
habitual
things
and
what
we
attend

true

association
it
is
obvious
that
all

in
knowledge
must
consist
of
both
operations
for
in
the
course
of
our
education
objects
at
first
appearing
as
wholes
are
analyzed
into
parts
and
objects
appearing
separately
are
brought
together
and
appear
as

and
synthesis
are
thus
the
incessantly
alternating
mental
activities

stroke
of

minds
make
between
things

as

transitions
which
at

sight
startle
us
by
their
abruptness
but
which
when
scrutinized
closely
often
reveal
intermediating
links
of
perfect
naturalness
and
propriety
all
this
magical
imponderable
streaming
has
from
time
immemorial
excited
the
admiration
of
all
whose
attention
happened
to
be
caught
by
its
omnipresent
mystery
and
it
has
furthermore
challenged
the
race
of
philosophers
to
banish
something
of
the
mystery
by
formulating
the
process
in
simpler
terms
the
problem
which
the
philosophers
have
set
themselves
is
that
of
ascertaining
between
the
thoughts
which
thus
appear
to
sprout
one
out
of
the
other
of
whereby
their
peculiar
succession
or
coexistence
may
be
explained
but
immediately
an
ambiguity
arises
which
sort
of
connection
is
meant
connection
or
connection
these
are
two
entirely
different
things
and
only
in
the
case
of
one
of
them
is
there
any
hope
of
finding
the
jungle
of

never

knows
what

list
is
literally
inexhaustible
the
only
simplification
which
could
possibly
be
aimed
at
would
be
the
reduction
of
the
relations
to
a
small
number
of
like
those
which
some
authors
call
the
of
the
understanding
according
as
we
followed
one
category
or
another
we
should
sweep
from
any
object
with
our
thought
in
this
way
or
in
that
to
others
were
the
sort
of
connection
sought
between
one
moment
of
our
thinking
and
another
our
chapter
might
end
here
for
the
only
summary
description
of
these
categories
is
that
they
are
all
thinkable
relations
and
that
the
mind
proceeds
from
one
object
to
another
by
some
intelligible
path
it
determined
by
any
laws
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
determines
the
particular
path
why
do
we
at
a
given
time
and
place
proceed
to
think
of
if
we
have
just
thought
of
and
at
another
time
and
place
why
do
we
think
not
of
but
of
why
do
we
spend
years
straining
after
a
certain
scientific
or
practical
problem
but
all
in
vain
our
thought
unable
to
evoke
the
solution
we
desire
and
why
some
day
walking
in
the
street
with
our
attention
miles
away
from
that
quest
does
the
answer
saunter
into
our
minds
as
carelessly
as
if
it
had
never
been
called
for
suggested
possibly
by
the
flowers
on
the
bonnet
of
the
lady
in
front
of
us
or
possibly
by
nothing
that
we
can
discover
the
truth
must
be
admitted
that
thought
works
under
strange
conditions
pure
is
only
one
out
of
a
thousand
possibilities
in
the
thinking
of
each
of
us
who
can
count
all
the
silly
fancies
the
grotesque
suppositions
the
utterly
irrelevant
reflections
he
makes
in
the
course
of
a
day
who
can
swear
that
his
prejudices
and
irrational
opinions
constitute
a
less
bulky
part
of
his
mental
furniture
than
his
clarified
beliefs
and
yet
the
of
of
the
worthy
and
the
worthless
in
our
thinking
seems
the
same
laws
are
cerebral
seem
to
be
mechanical
conditions
on
which
thought
depends
and
to
say
the
least
the
order
in
which
the
objects
for
her
comparisons
and
selections
are
it
is
a
suggestive
fact
that
locke
and
many
more
recent
continental
psychologists
have
found
themselves
obliged
to
invoke
a
mechanical
process
to
account
for
the
of
thought
the
obstructive
prepossessions
the
frustrations
of
reason
this
they
found
in
the
law
of
habit
or
what
we
now
call
association
by
contiguity
but
it
never
occurred
to
these
writers
that
a
process
which
could
go
the
length
of
actually
producing
some
ideas
and
sequences
in
the
mind
might
safely
be
trusted
to
produce
others
too
and
that
those
habitual
associations
which
further
thought
may
also
come
from
the
same
mechanical
source
as
those
which
hinder
it
hartley
accordingly
suggested
habit
as
a
sufficient
explanation
of
the
sequence
of
our
thoughts
and
in
so
doing
planted
himself
squarely
upon
the
properly
aspect
of
the
problem
and
sought
to
treat
both
rational
and
irrational
associations
from
a
single
point
of
view
how
does
a
man
come
after
having
the
thought
of
a
to
have
the
thought
of
b
the
next
moment
or
how
does
he
come
to
think
a
and
b
always
together
these
were
the
phenomena
which
hartley
undertook
to
explain
by
cerebral
physiology
i
believe
that
he
was
in
essential
respects
on
the
right
track
and
i
propose
simply
to
revise
his
conclusions
by
the
aid
of
distinctions
which
he
did
not
make
are
associated
not
we
shall
avoid
confusion
if
we
consistently
speak
as
if
so
far
as
the
word
stands
for
an
were
things
thought
of
if
it
things
ideas
which
are
associated
in
the
we
shall
talk
of
the
association
of
not
of
the
association
of
and
so
far
as
association
stands
for
a
it
is
between
in
the
it
is
these
which
by
being
associated
in
certain
ways
determine
what
successive
objects
shall
be
thought
elementary
i
shall
now
try
to
show
that
there
is
no
other
causal
law
of
association
than
the
law
of
neural
habit
all
the
of
our
thought
are
due
to
the
way
in
which
one
elementary
process
of
the
cerebral
hemispheres
tends
to
excite
whatever
other
elementary
process
it
may
have
excited
at
any
former
time
the
number
of
elementary
processes
at
work
however
and
the
nature
of
those
which
at
any
time
are
fully
effective
in
rousing
the
others
determine
the
character
of
the
total
and
as
a
consequence
of
this
they
determine
the
object
thought
of
at
the
time
according
as
this
resultant
object
is
one
thing
or
another
we
call
it
a
product
of
association
by
contiguity
or
of
association
by
similarity
or
contrast
or
whatever
other
sorts
we
may
have
recognized
as
ultimate
its
however
is
in
each
one
of
these
cases
to
be
explained
by
a
merely
quantitative
variation
in
the
elementary
momentarily
at
work
under
the
law
of
habit
my
thesis
stated
thus
briefly
will
soon
become
more
clear
and
at
the
same
time
certain
disturbing
factors
which
coÃ¶perate
with
the
law
of
neural
habit
will
come
to
view
let
us
then
assume
as
the
basis
of
all
our
subsequent
reasoning
this
law
two
elementary
have
been
active
together
or
in
immediate
succession
one
of
them
on
tends
to
propagate
its
excitement
into
the
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
every
elementary
process
has
unavoidably
found
itself
at
different
times
excited
in
conjunction
with
other
processes
which
of
these
others
it
shall
awaken
now
becomes
a
problem
shall
or
be
aroused
next
by
the
present
to
answer
this
we
must
make
a
further
postulate
based
on
the
fact
of
in
and
on
the
fact
of
summation
of
excitements
each
incomplete
or
latent
in
itself
into
an
open
resultant
see
the
process
rather
than
will
awake
if
in
addition
to
the
vibrating
tract
some
other
tract
is
in
a
state
of
and
formerly
was
excited
with
alone
and
not
with
in
short
we
may
say
amount
of
activity
at
any
given
point
in
the
is
the
sum
of
the
tendencies
of
all
other
points
to
discharge
into
it
such
tendencies
being
proportionate
to
the
number
of
times
the
excitement
of
each
other
point
may
have
accompanied
that
of
the
point
in
question
to
the
intensity
of
such
excitements
and
to
the
absence
of
any
rival
point
functionally
disconnected
with
the
first
point
into
which
the
discharges
might
be
expressing
the
fundamental
law
in
this
most
complicated
way
leads
to
the
greatest
ultimate
simplification
let
us
for
the
present
only
treat
of
spontaneous
trains
of
thought
and
ideation
such
as
occur
in
revery
or
musing
the
case
of
voluntary
thinking
toward
a
certain
end
shall
come
up
later
trains
of
take
to
fix
our
ideas
the
two
verses
from
hall
i
the
heir
of
all
in
the
foremost
files
of
time
and
for
i
doubt
not
through
one
increasing
purpose
runs
why
is
it
that
when
we
recite
from
memory
one
of
these
lines
and
get
as
far
as
that
portion
of
the
line
which
follows
and
so
to
speak
sprouts
out
of
does
not
also
sprout
out
of
our
memory
and
confuse
the
sense
of
our
words
simply
because
the
word
that
follows
has
its
awakened
not
simply
by
the
of
alone
but
by
it
the
of
all
the
words
preceding
the
word
at
its
moment
of
strongest
activity
would
indifferently
discharge
into
either
or
so
would
the
previous
words
whose
tension
is
momentarily
much
less
strong
than
that
of
each
of
them
indifferently
discharge
into
either
of
a
large
number
of
other
words
with
which
they
have
been
at
different
times
combined
but
when
the
processes
of
the
heir
of
all
the
simultaneously
vibrate
in
the
brain
the
last
one
of
them
in
a
maximal
the
others
in
a
fading
phase
of
excitement
then
the
strongest
line
of
discharge
will
be
that
which
they
tend
to
take
and
not
or
any
other
word
will
be
the
next
to
awaken
for
its
has
previously
vibrated
in
unison
not
only
with
that
of
but
with
that
of
all
those
other
words
whose
activity
is
dying
away
it
is
a
good
case
of
the
effectiveness
over
thought
of
what
we
called
on
a
but
if
some
one
of
these
preceding
words
for
example
had
an
intensely
strong
association
with
some
entirely
disjoined
in
experience
from
the
poem
of
hall
if
the
reciter
for
instance
were
tremulously
awaiting
the
opening
of
a
will
which
might
make
him
a
millionaire
it
is
probable
that
the
path
of
discharge
through
the
words
of
the
poem
would
be
suddenly
interrupted
at
the
word
his
interest
in
that
would
be
such
that
its
special
associations
would
over
the
combined
ones
of
the
other
words
he
would
as
we
say
be
abruptly
reminded
of
his
personal
situation
and
the
poem
would
lapse
altogether
from
his
thoughts
the
writer
of
these
pages
has
every
year
to
learn
the
names
of
a
large
number
of
students
who
sit
in
alphabetical
order
in
a
he
finally
learns
to
call
them
by
name
as
they
sit
in
their
accustomed
places
on
meeting
one
in
the
street
however
early
in
the
year
the
face
hardly
ever
recalls
the
name
but
it
may
recall
the
place
of
its
owner
in
the
his
neighbors
faces
and
consequently
his
general
alphabetical
position
and
then
usually
as
the
common
associate
of
all
these
combined
data
the
student
name
surges
up
in
his
mind
a
father
wishes
to
show
to
some
guests
the
progress
of
his
rather
dull
child
in
holding
the
knife
upright
on
the
table
he
says
what
do
you
call
that
my
boy
i
calls
it
a
i
does
is
the
sturdy
reply
from
which
the
child
can
not
be
induced
to
swerve
by
any
alteration
in
the
form
of
question
until
the
father
recollecting
that
in
the
kindergarten
a
pencil
was
used
and
not
a
knife
draws
a
long
one
from
his
pocket
holds
it
in
the
same
way
and
then
gets
the
answer
i
calls
it
all
the
concomitants
of
the
kindergarten
experience
had
to
recombine
their
effect
before
the
word
could
be
reawakened
the
ideal
working
of
the
law
of
compound
association
as
bain
calls
it
were
it
unmodified
by
any
extraneous
influence
would
be
such
as
to
keep
the
mind
in
a
perpetual
treadmill
of
concrete
reminiscences
from
which
no
detail
could
be
omitted
suppose
for
example
we
begin
by
thinking
of
a
certain
the
only
thing
which
all
the
components
of
the
could
combine
to
recall
would
be
the
first
concrete
occurrence
which
ensued
upon
it
all
the
details
of
this
occurrence
could
in
turn
only
combine
to
awaken
the
next
following
occurrence
and
so
on
if
for
instance
be
the
elementary
excited
by
the
last
act
of
the
call
this
act
and
be
those
of
walking
home
through
the
frosty
night
which
we
may
call
then
the
thought
of
must
awaken
that
of
because
will
each
and
all
discharge
into
through
the
paths
by
which
their
original
discharge
took
place
similarly
they
will
discharge
into
and
and
these
latter
tracts
will
also
each
reinforce
the
other
action
because
in
the
experience
they
have
already
vibrated
in
unison
the
lines
in
fig
symbolize
the
summation
of
discharges
into
each
of
the
components
of
and
the
consequent
strength
of
the
combination
of
influences
by
which
in
its
totality
is
awakened
illustration
fig
hamilton
first
used
the
word
to
designate
all
association
such
processes
as
we
have
just
described
might
in
an
emphatic
sense
be
termed
redintegrations
for
they
would
necessarily
lead
if
unobstructed
to
the
reinstatement
in
thought
of
the
content
of
large
trains
of
past
experience
from
this
complete
redintegration
there
could
be
no
escape
save
through
the
irruption
of
some
new
and
strong
present
impression
of
the
senses
or
through
the
excessive
tendency
of
some
one
of
the
elementary
to
discharge
independently
into
an
aberrant
quarter
of
the
brain
such
was
the
tendency
of
the
word
in
the
verse
from
hall
which
was
our
first
example
how
such
tendencies
are
constituted
we
shall
have
soon
to
inquire
with
some
care
unless
they
are
present
the
panorama
of
the
past
once
opened
must
unroll
itself
with
fatal
literality
to
the
end
unless
some
outward
sound
sight
or
touch
divert
the
current
of
thought
let
us
call
this
process
or
still
better
whether
it
ever
occurs
in
an
absolutely
complete
form
is
doubtful
we
all
immediately
recognize
however
that
in
some
minds
there
is
a
much
greater
tendency
than
in
others
for
the
flow
of
thought
to
take
this
form
those
insufferably
garrulous
old
women
those
dry
and
fanciless
beings
who
spare
you
no
detail
however
petty
of
the
facts
they
are
recounting
and
upon
the
thread
of
whose
narrative
all
the
irrelevant
items
cluster
as
pertinaciously
as
the
essential
ones
the
slaves
of
literal
fact
the
stumblers
over
the
smallest
abrupt
step
in
thought
are
figures
known
to
all
of
us
comic
literature
has
made
her
profit
out
of
them
juliet
nurse
is
a
classical
example
george
eliot
village
characters
and
some
of
dickens
minor
personages
supply
excellent
instances
perhaps
as
successful
a
rendering
as
any
of
this
mental
type
is
the
character
of
miss
bates
in

austen

how
she
redintegrates
where
could
hear
it
cried
miss
bates
could
you
possibly
hear
it
knightley
for
it
is
not
five
minutes
since
i
received
cole
note
no
it
can
not
be
more
than
five
or
at
least
ten
for
i
had
got
my
bonnet
and
spencer
on
just
ready
to
come
out
i
was
only
gone
down
to
speak
to
patty
again
about
the
pork
jane
was
standing
in
the
passage
were
not
you
jane
for
my
mother
was
so
afraid
that
we
had
not
any
large
enough
so
i
said
i
would
go
down
and
see
and
jane
said
shall
i
go
down
instead
for
i
think
you
have
a
little
cold
and
patty
has
been
washing
the
kitchen
oh
my
dear
said
i
well
and
just
then
came
the
note
a
miss
hawkins
all
i
know
a
miss
hawkins
of
bath
but
knightley
how
could
you
possibly
have
heard
it
for
the
very
moment
cole
told
cole
of
it
she
sat
down
and
wrote
to
me
a
miss
hawkins
this
case
helps
us
to
understand
why
it
is
that
the
ordinary
spontaneous
flow
of
our
ideas
does
not
follow
the
law
of
total
recall
no
revival
of
a
past
experience
are
all
the
items
of
our
thought
equally
operative
in
determining
what
the
next
thought
shall
be
always
some
ingredient
is
prepotent
over
the
its
special
suggestions
or
associations
in
this
case
will
often
be
different
from
those
which
it
has
in
common
with
the
whole
group
of
items
and
its
tendency
to
awaken
these
outlying
associates
will
deflect
the
path
of
our
revery
just
as
in
the
original
sensible
experience
our
attention
focalized
itself
upon
a
few
of
the
impressions
of
the
scene
before
us
so
here
in
the
reproduction
of
those
impressions
an
equal
partiality
is
shown
and
some
items
are
emphasized
above
the
rest
what
these
items
shall
be
is
in
most
cases
of
spontaneous
revery
hard
to
determine
beforehand
in
subjective
terms
we
say
that
prepotent
items
are
those
which
appeal
most
to
interest
expressed
in
the
law
of
interest
will
be
one
is
always
prepotent
above
its
concomitants
in
arousing
action
two
processes
says
hodgson
are
constantly
going
on
in
redintegration
the
one
a
process
of
corrosion
melting
decay
the
other
a
process
of
renewing
arising
becoming
no
object
of
representation
remains
long
before
consciousness
in
the
same
state
but
fades
decays
and
becomes
indistinct
those
parts
of
the
object
however
which
possess
an
interest
resist
this
tendency
to
gradual
decay
of
the
whole
object
this
inequality
in
the
object
some
parts
the
uninteresting
submitting
to
decay
others
the
interesting
parts
resisting
it
when
it
has
continued
for
a
certain
time
ends
in
becoming
a
new
object
only
where
the
interest
is
diffused
equally
over
all
the
parts
is
this
law
departed
from
it
will
be
least
obeyed
by
those
minds
which
have
the
smallest
variety
and
intensity
of
interests
those
who
by
the
general
flatness
and
poverty
of
their
Ã¦sthetic
nature
are
kept
for
ever
rotating
among
the
literal
sequences
of
their
local
and
personal
history
most
of
us
however
are
better
organized
than
this
and
our
musings
pursue
an
erratic
course
swerving
continually
into
some
new
direction
traced
by
the
shifting
play
of
interest
as
it
ever
falls
on
some
partial
item
in
each
complex
representation
that
is
evoked
thus
it
so
often
comes
about
that
we
find
ourselves
thinking
at
two
nearly
adjacent
moments
of
things
separated
by
the
whole
diameter
of
space
and
time
not
till
we
carefully
recall
each
step
of
our
cogitation
do
we
see
how
naturally
we
came
by
hodgson
law
to
pass
from
one
to
the
other
thus
for
instance
after
looking
at
my
clock
just
now
i
found
myself
thinking
of
a
recent
resolution
in
the
senate
about
our
notes
the
clock
called
up
the
image
of
the
man
who
had
repaired
its
gong
he
suggested
the
jeweller
shop
where
i
had
last
seen
him
that
shop
some
which
i
had
bought
there
they
the
value
of
gold
and
its
recent
decline
the
latter
the
equal
value
of
greenbacks
and
this
naturally
the
question
of
how
long
they
were
to
last
and
of
the
bayard
proposition
each
of
these
images
offered
various
points
of
interest
those
which
formed
the
of
my
thought
are
easily
assigned
the
gong
was
momentarily
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
clock
because
from
having
begun
with
a
beautiful
tone
it
had
become
discordant
and
aroused
disappointment
but
for
this
the
clock
might
have
suggested
the
friend
who
gave
it
to
me
or
any
one
of
a
thousand
circumstances
connected
with
clocks
the
jeweller
shop
suggested
the
studs
because
they
alone
of
all
its
contents
were
tinged
with
the
egoistic
interest
of
possession
this
interest
in
the
studs
their
value
made
me
single
out
the
material
as
its
chief
source
to
the
end
every
reader
who
will
arrest
himself
at
any
moment
and
say
how
came
i
to
be
thinking
of
just
this
will
be
sure
to
trace
a
train
of
representations
linked
together
by
lines
of
contiguity
and
points
of
interest
inextricably
combined
this
is
the
ordinary
process
of
the
association
of
ideas
as
it
spontaneously
goes
on
in
average
minds
may
call
it
ordinary
or
mixed
or
if
we
like
better
associates
come
up
in
partial
recall
can
we
determine
now
when
a
certain
portion
of
the
going
thought
has
by
dint
of
its
interest
become
so
prepotent
as
to
make
its
own
exclusive
associates
the
dominant
features
of
the
coming
thought
can
we
i
say
determine
of
its
own
associates
shall
be
evoked
for
they
are
many
as
hodgson
says
the
interesting
parts
of
the
decaying
object
are
free
to
combine
again
with
any
objects
or
parts
of
objects
with
which
at
any
time
they
have
been
combined
before
all
the
former
combinations
of
these
parts
may
come
back
into
consciousness
one
must
but
which
will
hodgson
replies
there
can
be
but
one
answer
that
which
has
been
most
combined
with
them
before
this
new
object
begins
at
once
to
form
itself
in
consciousness
and
to
group
its
parts
round
the
part
still
remaining
from
the
former
object
part
after
part
comes
out
and
arranges
itself
in
its
old
position
but
scarcely
has
the
process
begun
when
the
original
law
of
interest
begins
to
operate
on
this
new
formation
seizes
on
the
interesting
parts
and
impresses
them
on
the
attention
to
the
exclusion
of
the
rest
and
the
whole
process
is
repeated
again
with
endless
variety
i
venture
to
propose
this
as
a
complete
and
true
account
of
the
whole
process
of
redintegration
in
restricting
the
discharge
from
the
interesting
item
into
that
channel
which
is
simply
most
in
the
sense
of
most
frequent
account
is
assuredly
imperfect
an
image
by
no
means
always
revives
its
most
frequent
associate
although
frequency
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
potent
determinants
of
revival
if
i
abruptly
utter
the
word
the
reader
if
by
habit
an
ornithologist
will
think
of
a
bird
if
a
physiologist
or
a
medical
specialist
in
he
will
think
of
deglutition
if
i
say
he
will
if
a
or
an
arabian
traveller
think
of
the
produce
of
the
palm
if
an
habitual
student
of
history
figures
with
or
before
them
will
rise
in
his
mind
if
i
say
his
own
daily
toilet
will
be
invincibly
suggested
by
the
combined
names
of
three
of
its
habitual
associates
but
frequent
lines
of
transition
are
often
set
at
naught
the
sight
of
a
certain
book
has
most
frequently
awakened
in
me
thoughts
of
the
opinions
therein
propounded
the
idea
of
suicide
has
never
been
connected
with
the
volume
but
a
moment
since
as
my
eye
fell
upon
it
suicide
was
the
thought
that
flashed
into
my
mind
why
because
but
yesterday
i
received
a
letter
informing
me
that
the
author
recent
death
was
an
act
of
thoughts
tend
then
to
awaken
their
most
recent
as
well
as
their
most
habitual
associates
this
is
a
matter
of
notorious
experience
too
notorious
in
fact
to
need
illustration
if
we
have
seen
our
friend
this
morning
the
mention
of
his
name
now
recalls
the
circumstances
of
that
interview
rather
than
any
more
remote
details
concerning
him
if
shakespeare
plays
are
mentioned
and
we
were
last
night
reading
vestiges
of
that
play
rather
than
of
or
float
through
our
mind
excitement
of
peculiar
tracts
or
peculiar
modes
of
general
excitement
in
the
brain
leave
a
sort
of
tenderness
or
exalted
sensibility
behind
them
which
takes
days
to
die
away
as
long
as
it
lasts
those
tracts
or
those
modes
are
liable
to
have
their
activities
awakened
by
causes
which
at
other
times
might
leave
them
in
repose
hence
in
experience
is
a
prime
factor
in
determining
revival
in
thought
in
an
original
experience
may
also
have
the
same
effect
as
habit
or
recency
in
bringing
about
likelihood
of
revival
if
we
have
once
witnessed
an
execution
any
subsequent
conversation
or
reading
about
capital
punishment
will
almost
certainly
suggest
images
of
that
particular
scene
thus
it
is
that
events
lived
through
only
once
and
in
youth
may
come
in
by
reason
of
their
exciting
quality
or
emotional
intensity
to
serve
as
types
or
instances
used
by
our
mind
to
illustrate
any
and
every
occurring
topic
whose
interest
is
most
remotely
pertinent
to
theirs
if
a
man
in
his
boyhood
once
talked
with
napoleon
any
mention
of
great
men
or
historical
events
battles
or
thrones
or
the
whirligig
of
fortune
or
islands
in
the
ocean
will
be
apt
to
draw
to
his
lips
the
incidents
of
that
one
memorable
interview
if
the
word
now
suddenly
appears
on
the
page
before
the
reader
eye
there
are
fifty
chances
out
of
a
hundred
that
if
he
gives
it
time
to
awaken
any
image
it
will
be
an
image
of
some
operation
of
dentistry
in
which
he
has
been
the
sufferer
daily
he
has
touched
his
teeth
and
masticated
with
them
this
very
morning
he
brushed
used
and
picked
them
but
the
rarer
and
remoter
associations
arise
more
promptly
because
they
were
so
much
more
intense
a
fourth
factor
in
tracing
the
course
of
reproduction
is
in
emotional
between
the
reproduced
idea
and
our
mood
the
same
objects
do
not
recall
the
same
associates
when
we
are
cheerful
as
when
we
are
melancholy
nothing
in
fact
is
more
striking
than
our
inability
to
keep
up
trains
of
joyous
imagery
when
we
are
depressed
in
spirits
storm
darkness
war
images
of
disease
poverty
perishing
and
dread
afflict
unremittingly
the
imaginations
of
melancholiacs
and
those
of
sanguine
temperament
when
their
spirits
are
high
find
it
impossible
to
give
any
permanence
to
evil
forebodings
or
to
gloomy
thoughts
in
an
instant
the
train
of
association
dances
off
to
flowers
and
sunshine
and
images
of
spring
and
hope
the
records
of
arctic
or
african
travel
perused
in
one
mood
awaken
no
thoughts
but
those
of
horror
at
the
malignity
of
nature
read
at
another
time
they
suggest
only
enthusiastic
reflections
on
the
indomitable
power
and
pluck
of
man
few
novels
so
overflow
with
joyous
animal
spirits
as
three
of
dumas
yet
it
may
awaken
in
the
mind
of
a
reader
depressed
with
as
the
writer
can
personally
testify
a
most
woful
consciousness
of
the
cruelty
and
carnage
of
which
heroes
like
athos
porthos
and
aramis
make
themselves
guilty
recency
vividness
and
emotional
are
then
all
reasons
why
one
representation
rather
than
another
should
be
awakened
by
the
interesting
portion
of
a
departing
thought
we
may
say
with
truth
that
the
majority
of
cases
the
coming
representation
will
have
been
either
habitual
recent
or
vivid
and
will
be
if
all
these
qualities
unite
in
any
one
absent
associate
we
may
predict
almost
infallibly
that
that
associate
of
the
going
object
will
form
an
important
ingredient
in
the
object
which
comes
next
in
spite
of
the
fact
however
that
the
succession
of
representations
is
thus
redeemed
from
perfect
indeterminism
and
limited
to
a
few
classes
whose
characteristic
quality
is
fixed
by
the
nature
of
our
past
experience
it
must
still
be
confessed
that
an
immense
number
of
terms
in
the
linked
chain
of
our
representations
fall
outside
of
all
assignable
rule
to
take
the
instance
of
the
clock
given
on
page
why
did
the
shop
suggest
the
rather
than
a
chain
which
i
had
bought
there
more
recently
which
had
cost
more
and
whose
sentimental
associations
were
much
more
interesting
any
reader
experience
will
easily
furnish
similar
instances
so
we
must
admit
that
to
a
certain
extent
even
in
those
forms
of
ordinary
mixed
association
which
lie
nearest
to
impartial
redintegration
associate
of
the
interesting
item
shall
emerge
must
be
called
largely
a
matter
of
accident
accident
that
is
for
our
intelligence
no
doubt
it
is
determined
by
cerebral
causes
but
they
are
too
subtile
and
shifting
for
our
analysis
recall
or
association
by
in
partial
or
mixed
association
we
have
all
along
supposed
the
interesting
portion
of
the
disappearing
thought
to
be
of
considerable
extent
and
to
be
sufficiently
complex
to
constitute
by
itself
a
concrete
object
sir
william
hamilton
relates
for
instance
that
after
thinking
of
ben
lomond
he
found
himself
thinking
of
the
prussian
system
of
education
and
discovered
that
the
links
of
association
were
a
german
gentleman
whom
he
had
met
on
ben
lomond
germany
etc
the
interesting
part
of
ben
lomond
as
he
had
experienced
it
the
part
operative
in
determining
the
train
of
his
ideas
was
the
complex
image
of
a
particular
man
but
now
let
us
suppose
that
the
interested
attention
refines
itself
still
further
and
accentuates
a
portion
of
the
passing
object
so
small
as
to
be
no
longer
the
image
of
a
concrete
thing
but
only
of
an
abstract
quality
or
property
let
us
moreover
suppose
that
the
part
thus
accentuated
persists
in
consciousness
or
in
cerebral
terms
has
its
continue
after
the
other
portions
of
the
object
have
faded
small
surviving
portion
will
then
surround
itself
with
its
own
after
the
fashion
we
have
already
seen
and
the
relation
between
the
new
thought
object
and
the
object
of
the
faded
thought
will
be
a
of
the
pair
of
thoughts
will
form
an
instance
of
what
is
called
by
the
similars
which
are
here
associated
or
of
which
the
first
is
followed
by
the
second
in
the
mind
are
seen
to
be
experience
proves
that
this
is
always
the
case
is
no
tendency
on
the
part
simple
attributes
or
qualities
to
remind
us
of
their
the
thought
of
one
shade
of
blue
does
not
summon
up
that
of
another
shade
of
blue
unless
indeed
we
have
in
mind
some
general
purpose
of
nomenclature
or
comparison
which
requires
a
review
of
several
blue
tints
now
two
compound
things
are
similar
when
some
one
quality
or
group
of
qualities
is
shared
alike
by
both
although
as
regards
their
other
qualities
they
may
have
nothing
in
common
the
moon
is
similar
to
a
it
is
also
similar
to
a
but
a
and
a
are
not
similar
to
each
other
when
we
affirm
the
similarity
of
two
compound
things
we
should
always
say
what
respect
it
moon
and
are
similar
in
respect
of
luminosity
and
nothing
else
moon
and
in
respect
of
rotundity
and
nothing
else
and
are
in
no
respect
similar
that
is
they
possess
no
common
point
no
identical
attribute
in
compounds
is
partial
when
the
attribute
appears
in
two
phenomena
though
it
be
their
only
common
property
the
two
phenomena
are
similar
in
so
far
forth
to
return
now
to
our
associated
representations
if
the
thought
of
the
moon
is
succeeded
by
the
thought
of
a
and
that
by
the
thought
of
one
of
x
railroads
it
is
because
the
attribute
rotundity
in
the
moon
broke
away
from
all
the
rest
and
surrounded
itself
with
an
entirely
new
set
of
companions
elasticity
leathery
integument
swift
mobility
in
obedience
to
human
caprice
etc
and
because
the
attribute
in
the
in
turn
broke
away
from
its
companions
and
itself
persisting
surrounded
itself
with
such
new
attributes
as
make
up
the
notions
of
a
king
of
a
rising
and
falling
and
the
like
illustration
fig
the
gradual
passage
from
total
to
focalized
through
what
we
have
called
ordinary
partial
recall
may
be
symbolized
by
diagrams
fig
is
total
fig
is
partial
and
fig
focalized
recall
in
each
is
the
passing
the
coming
thought
in
recall
all
parts
of
are
equally
operative
in
calling
up
in
recall
most
parts
of
are
inert
the
part
alone
breaks
out
and
awakens
in
similar
association
or
recall
the
part
is
much
smaller
than
in
the
previous
case
and
after
awakening
its
new
set
of
associates
instead
of
fading
out
itself
it
continues
persistently
active
along
with
them
forming
an
identical
part
in
the
two
ideas
and
making
these
resemble
each
other
illustration
fig
illustration

why
a
single
portion
of
the
passing
thought
should
break
out
from
its
concert
with
the
rest
and
act
as
we
say
on
its
own
hook
why
the
other
parts
should
become
inert
are
mysteries
which
we
can
ascertain
but
not
explain
possibly
a
minuter
insight
into
the
laws
of
neural
action
will
some
day
clear
the
matter
up
possibly
neural
laws
will
not
suffice
and
we
shall
need
to
invoke
a
dynamic
reaction
of
the
consciousness
itself
but
into
this
we
can
not
enter
now
trains
of
hitherto
we
have
assumed
the
process
of
suggestion
of
one
object
by
another
to
be
spontaneous
the
train
of
imagery
wanders
at
its
own
sweet
will
now
trudging
in
sober
grooves
of
habit
now
with
a
hop
skip
and
jump
darting
across
the
whole
field
of
time
and
space
this
is
revery
or
musing
but
great
segments
of
the
flux
of
our
ideas
consist
of
something
very
different
from
this
they
are
guided
by
a
distinct
purpose
or
conscious
interest
and
the
course
of
our
ideas
is
then
called
physiologically
considered
we
must
suppose
that
a
purpose
means
the
persistent
activity
of
certain
rather
definite
throughout
the
whole
course
of
thought
our
most
usual
cogitations
are
not
pure
reveries
absolute
driftings
but
revolve
about
some
central
interest
or
topic
to
which
most
of
the
images
are
relevant
and
towards
which
we
return
promptly
after
occasional
digressions
this
interest
is
subserved
by
the
persistently
active
we
have
supposed
in
the
mixed
associations
which
we
have
hitherto
studied
the
parts
of
each
object
which
form
the
pivots
on
which
our
thoughts
successively
turn
have
their
interest
largely
determined
by
their
connection
with
some
which
for
the
time
has
seized
upon
the
mind
if
we
call
the
of
general
interest
then
if
the
object
turns
up
and
has
more
associations
with
than
have
either
or
will
become
the
object
interesting
pivotal
portion
and
will
call
up
its
own
associates
exclusively
for
the
energy
of
will
be
augmented
by
activity
an
activity
which
from
lack
of
previous
connection
between
and
and
and
does
not
influence
or
if
for
instance
i
think
of
paris
whilst
i
am
i
shall
not
improbably
find
that
its
have
become
the
pivot
of
my
thought
etc
but
in
the
theoretic
as
well
as
in
the
practical
life
there
are
interests
of
a
more
acute
sort
taking
the
form
of
definite
images
of
some
achievement
which
we
desire
to
effect
the
train
of
ideas
arising
under
the
influence
of
such
an
interest
constitutes
usually
the
thought
of
the
by
which
the
end
shall
be
attained
if
the
end
by
its
simple
presence
does
not
instantaneously
suggest
the
means
the
search
for
the
latter
becomes
a
and
the
discovery
of
the
means
forms
a
new
sort
of
end
of
an
entirely
peculiar
nature
an
end
namely
which
we
intensely
desire
before
we
have
attained
it
but
of
the
nature
of
which
even
whilst
most
strongly
craving
it
we
have
no
distinct
imagination
whatever
compare
pp
the
same
thing
occurs
whenever
we
seek
to
recall
something
forgotten
or
to
state
the
reason
for
a
judgment
which
we
have
made
intuitively
the
desire
strains
and
presses
in
a
direction
which
it
feels
to
be
right
but
towards
a
point
which
it
is
unable
to
see
in
short
the
of
an
is
a
determinant
of
our
representations
quite
as
positive
as
its
presence
can
ever
be
the
gap
becomes
no
mere
void
but
what
is
called
an
void
if
we
try
to
explain
in
terms
of
how
a
thought
which
only
potentially
exists
can
yet
be
effective
we
seem
driven
to
believe
that
the
thereof
must
actually
be
excited
but
only
in
a
minimal
and
way
try
for
instance
to
symbolize
what
goes
on
in
a
man
who
is
racking
his
brains
to
remember
a
thought
which
occurred
to
him
last
week
the
associates
of
the
thought
are
there
many
of
them
at
least
but
they
refuse
to
awaken
the
thought
itself
we
can
not
suppose
that
they
do
not
irradiate
into
its
because
his
mind
quivers
on
the
very
edge
of
its
recovery
its
actual
rhythm
sounds
in
his
ears
the
words
seem
on
the
imminent
point
of
following
but
fail
see
now
the
only
difference
between
the
effort
to
recall
things
forgotten
and
the
search
after
the
means
to
a
given
end
is
that
the
latter
have
not
whilst
the
former
have
already
formed
a
part
of
our
experience
if
we
first
study
mode
of
recalling
a
thing
we
can
take
up
with
better
understanding
the
voluntary
quest
of
the
unknown
the
forgotten
thing
is
felt
by
us
as
a
gap
in
the
midst
of
certain
other
things
we
possess
a
dim
idea
of
where
we
were
and
what
we
were
about
when
it
last
occurred
to
us
we
recollect
the
general
subject
to
which
it
pertains
but
all
these
details
refuse
to
shoot
together
into
a
solid
whole
for
the
lack
of
the
missing
thing
so
we
keep
running
over
them
in
our
mind
dissatisfied
craving
something
more
from
each
detail
there
radiate
lines
of
association
forming
so
many
tentative
guesses
many
of
these
are
immediately
seen
to
be
irrelevant
are
therefore
void
of
interest
and
lapse
immediately
from
consciousness
others
are
associated
with
the
other
details
present
and
with
the
missing
thought
as
well
when
surge
up
we
have
a
peculiar
feeling
that
we
are
as
the
children
say
when
they
play
hide
and
seek
and
such
associates
as
these
we
clutch
at
and
keep
before
the
attention
thus
we
recollect
successively
that
when
we
last
were
considering
the
matter
in
question
we
were
at
the
then
that
our
friend
was
there
then
that
the
subject
talked
about
was
so
and
so
finally
that
the
thought
came
of
a
certain
anecdote
and
then
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
a
french
quotation
now
all
these
added
associates
independently
of
the
by
the
spontaneous
processes
we
know
so
well
that
the
will
does
is
to
emphasize
and
linger
over
those
which
seem
pertinent
and
ignore
the
through
this
hovering
of
the
attention
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
desired
object
the
accumulation
of
associates
becomes
so
great
that
the
combined
tensions
of
their
neural
processes
break
through
the
bar
and
the
nervous
wave
pours
into
the
tract
which
has
so
long
been
awaiting
its
advent
and
as
the
expectant
itching
so
to
speak
bursts
into
the
fulness
of
vivid
feeling
the
mind
finds
an
inexpressible
relief
illustration
fig
the
whole
process
can
be
rudely
symbolized
in
a
diagram
call
the
forgotten
thing
the
first
facts
with
which
we
felt
it
was
related
and
and
the
details
finally
operative
in
calling
it
up
and
each
circle
will
then
stand
for
the
principally
concerned
in
the
thought
of
the
fact
lettered
within
it
the
activity
in
will
at
first
be
a
mere
tension
but
as
the
activities
in
and
little
by
little
irradiate
into
and
and
as
these
processes
are
somehow
connected
with
their
combined
irradiations
upon
represented
by
the
centripetal
arrows
succeed
in
rousing
also
to
full
activity
now
to
the
case
of
finding
the
unknown
means
to
a
distinctly
conceived
the
end
here
stands
in
the
place
of
in
the
diagram
it
is
the
of
the
irradiations
of
suggestion
and
here
as
in
that
case
what
the
voluntary
attention
does
is
only
to
dismiss
some
of
the
suggestions
as
irrelevant
and
hold
fast
to
others
which
are
felt
to
be
more
pertinent
let
these
be
symbolized
by
these
latter
at
last
accumulate
sufficiently
to
discharge
all
together
into
the
excitement
of
which
process
is
in
the
mental
sphere
equivalent
to
the
solution
of
our
problem
the
only
difference
between
this
and
the
previous
case
is
that
in
this
one
there
need
be
no
original
in
coÃ¶perating
from
the
very
first
in
the
solving
of
a
problem
all
that
we
are
aware
of
in
advance
seems
to
be
its
it
must
be
a
cause
or
it
must
be
an
effect
or
it
must
contain
an
attribute
or
it
must
be
a
means
or
what
not
we
know
in
short
a
lot
it
whilst
as
yet
we
have
no
with
it
our
perception
that
one
of
the
objects
which
turn
up
is
at
last
our
is
due
to
our
recognition
that
its
relations
are
identical
with
those
we
had
in
mind
and
this
may
be
a
rather
slow
act
of
judgment
every
one
knows
that
an
object
may
be
for
some
time
present
to
his
mind
before
its
relations
to
other
matters
are
perceived
just
so
the
relations
may
be
there
before
the
object
is
from
the
guessing
of
newspaper
enigmas
to
the
plotting
of
the
policy
of
an
empire
there
is
no
other
process
than
this
we
must
trust
to
the
laws
of
cerebral
nature
to
present
us
spontaneously
with
the
appropriate
idea
but
we
must
know
it
for
the
right
one
when
it
comes
it
is
foreign
to
my
purpose
here
to
enter
into
any
detailed
analysis
of
the
different
classes
of
mental
pursuit
in
a
scientific
research
we
get
perhaps
as
rich
an
example
as
can
be
found
the
inquirer
starts
with
a
fact
of
which
he
seeks
the
reason
or
with
an
hypothesis
of
which
he
seeks
the
proof
in
either
case
he
keeps
turning
the
matter
incessantly
in
his
mind
until
by
the
arousal
of
associate
upon
associate
some
habitual
some
similar
one
arises
which
he
recognizes
to
suit
his
need
this
however
may
take
years
no
rules
can
be
given
by
which
the
investigator
may
proceed
straight
to
his
result
but
both
here
and
in
the
case
of
reminiscence
the
accumulation
of
helps
in
the
way
of
associations
may
advance
more
rapidly
by
the
use
of
certain
routine
methods
in
striving
to
recall
a
thought
for
example
we
may
of
set
purpose
run
through
the
successive
classes
of
circumstance
with
which
it
may
possibly
have
been
connected
trusting
that
when
the
right
member
of
the
class
has
turned
up
it
will
help
the
thought
revival
thus
we
may
run
through
all
the
in
which
we
may
have
had
it
we
may
run
through
the
whom
we
remember
to
have
conversed
with
or
we
may
call
up
successively
all
the
we
have
lately
been
reading
if
we
are
trying
to
remember
a
person
we
may
run
through
a
list
of
streets
or
of
professions
some
item
out
of
the
lists
thus
methodically
gone
over
will
very
likely
be
associated
with
the
fact
we
are
in
need
of
and
may
suggest
it
or
help
to
do
so
and
yet
the
item
might
never
have
arisen
without
such
systematic
procedure
in
scientific
research
this
accumulation
of
associates
has
been
methodized
by
mill
under
the
title
of
four
methods
of
experimental
inquiry
by
the
of
agreement
by
that
of
by
those
of
and
variations
which
can
not
here
be
more
nearly
defined
we
make
certain
lists
of
cases
and
by
ruminating
these
lists
in
our
minds
the
cause
we
seek
will
be
more
likely
to
emerge
but
the
final
stroke
of
discovery
is
only
prepared
not
effected
by
them
the
must
of
their
own
accord
shoot
the
right
way
at
last
or
we
shall
still
grope
in
darkness
that
in
some
brains
the
tracts
shoot
the
right
way
much
oftener
than
in
others
and
that
we
can
not
tell
why
these
are
ultimate
facts
to
which
we
must
never
close
our
eyes
even
in
forming
our
lists
of
instances
according
to
mill
methods
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
spontaneous
workings
of
similarity
in
our
brain
how
are
a
number
of
facts
resembling
the
one
whose
cause
we
seek
to
be
brought
together
in
a
list
unless
one
will
rapidly
suggest
another
through
association
by
similarity
no
elementary
such
is
the
analysis
i
propose
first
of
the
three
main
types
of
spontaneous
and
then
of
voluntary
trains
of
thought
it
will
be
observed
that
the
called
up
may
bear
any
logical
relation
whatever
to
the
one
which
suggested
the
law
requires
only
that
one
condition
should
be
fulfilled
the
fading
object
must
be
due
to
a
some
of
whose
elements
awaken
through
habit
some
of
the
elements
of
the
of
the
object
which
comes
to
view
this
awakening
is
the
causal
agency
in
the
kind
of
association
called
similarity
as
in
any
other
sort
the
similarity
between
the
objects
has
no
causal
agency
in
carrying
us
from
one
to
the
other
it
is
but
a
result
the
effect
of
the
usual
causal
agent
when
this
happens
to
work
in
a
certain
way
ordinary
writers
talk
as
if
the
similarity
of
the
objects
were
itself
an
agent
coÃ¶rdinate
with
habit
and
independent
of
it
and
like
it
able
to
push
objects
before
the
mind
this
is
quite
unintelligible
the
similarity
of
two
things
does
not
exist
till
both
things
are
there
it
is
meaningless
to
talk
of
it
as
an
of
of
anything
whether
in
the
physical
or
the
psychical
realms
it
is
a
relation
which
the
mind
perceives
after
the
fact
just
as
it
may
perceive
the
relations
of
superiority
of
distance
of
causality
of
container
and
content
of
substance
and
accident
or
of
contrast
between
an
object
and
some
second
object
which
the
associative
machinery
calls
up
to
sum
up
then
we
see
that
difference
between
the
three
kinds
of
association
reduces
itself
to
a
simple
difference
in
the
amount
of
that
portion
of
the
supporting
the
going
thought
which
is
operative
in
calling
up
the
thought
which
but
the
of
this
active
part
is
the
same
be
it
large
or
be
it
small
the
items
constituting
the
coming
object
waken
in
every
instance
because
their
once
were
excited
continuously
with
those
of
the
going
object
or
its
operative
part
this
ultimate
physiological
law
of
habit
among
the
neural
elements
is
what
the
train
the
direction
of
its
course
and
the
form
of
its
transitions
are
due
to
the
unknown
conditions
by
which
in
some
brains
action
tends
to
focalize
itself
in
small
spots
while
in
others
it
fills
patiently
its
broad
bed
what
these
differing
conditions
are
it
seems
impossible
to
guess
whatever
they
are
they
are
what
separate
the
man
of
genius
from
the
prosaic
creature
of
habit
and
routine
thinking
in
the
chapter
on
reasoning
we
shall
need
to
recur
again
to
this
point
i
trust
that
the
student
will
now
feel
that
the
way
to
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
order
of
our
ideas
lies
in
the
direction
of
cerebral
physiology
the
process
of
revival
can
be
nothing
but
the
law
of
habit
truly
the
day
is
distant
when
physiologists
shall
actually
trace
from
to
the
irradiations
which
we
have
hypothetically
invoked
probably
it
will
never
arrive
the
schematism
we
have
used
is
moreover
taken
immediately
from
the
analysis
of
objects
into
their
elementary
parts
and
only
extended
by
analogy
to
the
brain
and
yet
it
is
only
as
incorporated
in
the
brain
that
such
a
schematism
can
represent
anything
this
is
to
my
mind
the
conclusive
reason
for
saying
that
the
order
of
of
the
mind
is
due
to
cerebral
physiology
alone
the
law
of
accidental
prepotency
of
certain
processes
over
others
falls
also
within
the
sphere
of
cerebral
probabilities
granting
such
instability
as
the
requires
certain
points
must
always
discharge
more
quickly
and
strongly
than
others
and
this
prepotency
would
shift
its
place
from
moment
to
moment
by
accidental
causes
giving
us
a
perfect
mechanical
diagram
of
the
capricious
play
of
similar
association
in
the
most
gifted
mind
a
study
of
dreams
confirms
this
view
the
usual
abundance
of
paths
of
irradiation
seems
in
the
dormant
brain
reduced
a
few
only
are
pervious
and
the
most
fantastic
sequences
occur
because
the
currents
run
sparks
in
paper
wherever
the
nutrition
of
the
moment
creates
an
opening
but
nowhere
else
the
of
interested
attention
and
remain
these
activities
seem
to
hold
fast
to
certain
elements
and
by
emphasizing
them
and
dwelling
on
them
to
make
their
associates
the
only
ones
which
are
evoked
is
the
point
at
which
an
psychology
must
if
anywhere
make
its
stand
in
dealing
with
association
everything
else
is
pretty
certainly
due
to
cerebral
laws
my
own
opinion
on
the
question
of
active
attention
and
spiritual
spontaneity
is
expressed
elsewhere
see
but
even
though
there
be
a
mental
spontaneity
it
can
certainly
not
create
ideas
or
summon
them
its
power
is
limited
to
amongst
those
which
the
associative
machinery
introduces
if
it
can
emphasize
reinforce
or
protract
for
half
a
second
either
one
of
these
it
can
do
all
that
the
most
eager
advocate
of
free
will
need
demand
for
it
then
decides
the
direction
of
the
associations
by
making
them
hinge
upon
the
emphasized
term
and
determining
in
this
wise
the
course
of
the
thinking
it
also
determines
his
acts

let
any
one
try
i
will
not

to
arrest
but
to
notice
or
attend
to
the
moment
of
time
one
of
the
most
baffling
experiences
occurs
where
is
it
this
present
it
has
melted
in
our
grasp

ere

quoted
by

le

and
it
is
only
as
entering
into
the

organization
of
a
much
wider
tract
of
time
that
the
strict
present
is
apprehended
at
all
it
is
in
fact
an
altogether
ideal
abstraction
not
only
never
realized
in
sense
but
probably
never
even
conceived
of
by
those
unaccustomed
to
philosophic
meditation
reflection
leads
us
to
the
conclusion
that
it
exist
but
that
it
exist
can
never
be
a
fact
of
our
immediate
experience
the
only
fact
of
our
immediate
experience
is
what
has
been
well
called
specious
present
a
sort
of
of
time
with
a
certain
length
of
its
own
on
which
we
sit
perched
and
from
which
we
look
in
two
directions
into
time
the
unit
of
composition
of
our
perception
of
time
is
a
with
a
bow
and
a
stern
as
it
were
a
a
end
it
is
only
as
parts
of
this
that
the
relation
of
of
one
end
to
the
other
is
perceived
we
do
not
first
feel
one
end
and
then
feel
the
other
after
it
and
from
the
perception
of
the
succession
infer
an
interval
of
time
between
but
we
seem
to
feel
the
interval
of
time
as
a
whole
with
its
two
ends
embedded
in
it
the
experience
is
from
the
outset
a
synthetic
datum
not
a
simple
one
and
to
sensible
perception
its
elements
are
inseparable
although
attention
looking
back
may
easily
decompose
the
experience
and
distinguish
its
beginning
from
its
end
the
moment
we
pass
beyond
a
very
few
seconds
our
consciousness
of
duration
ceases
to
be
an
immediate
perception
and
becomes
a
construction
more
or
less
symbolic
to
realize
even
an
hour
we
must
count
now
now
now
indefinitely
each
is
the
feeling
of
a
separate
of
time
and
the
exact
sum
of
the
bits
never
makes
a
clear
impression
on
our
mind
the
bit
of
which
we
can
apprehend
at
once
so
as
to
discriminate
it
from
longer
and
shorter
bits
of
time
would
seem
from
experiments
made
for
another
purpose
in
wundt
laboratory
to
be
about
seconds
shortest
which
we
can
feel
as
time
at
all
would
seem
to
be
of
a
second
that
is
exner
recognized
two
electric
sparks
to
be
successive
when
the
second
followed
the
first
at
that
interval
have
no
sense
for
empty
let
one
sit
with
closed
eyes
and
abstracting
entirely
from
the
outer
world
attend
exclusively
to
the
passage
of
time
like
one
who
wakes
as
the
poet
says
to
hear
time
flowing
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
all
things
moving
to
a
day
of
doom
there
seems
under
such
circumstances
as
these
no
variety
in
the
material
content
of
our
thought
and
what
we
notice
appears
if
anything
to
be
the
pure
series
of
durations
budding
as
it
were
and
growing
beneath
our
indrawn
gaze
is
this
really
so
or
not
the
question
is
important
for
if
the
experience
be
what
it
roughly
seems
we
have
a
sort
of
special
sense
for
pure
time
a
sense
to
which
empty
duration
is
an
adequate
stimulus
while
if
it
be
an
illusion
it
must
be
that
our
perception
of
time
flight
in
the
experiences
quoted
is
due
to
the
of
the
time
and
to
our
of
a
content
which
it
had
a
moment
previous
and
which
we
feel
to
agree
or
disagree
with
its
content
now
it
takes
but
a
small
exertion
of
introspection
to
show
that
the
latter
alternative
is
the
true
one
and
that
can
no
more
perceive
a
duration
than
we
can
perceive
an
extension
devoid
of
all
sensible
just
as
with
closed
eyes
we
see
a
dark
visual
field
in
which
a
curdling
play
of
obscurest
luminosity
is
always
going
on
so
be
we
never
so
abstracted
from
distinct
outward
impressions
we
are
always
inwardly
immersed
in
what
wundt
has
somewhere
called
the
twilight
of
our
general
consciousness
our
our
breathing
the
pulses
of
our
attention
fragments
of
words
or
sentences
that
pass
through
our
imagination
are
what
people
this
dim
habitat
now
all
these
processes
are
rhythmical
and
are
apprehended
by
us
as
they
occur
in
their
totality
the
breathing
and
pulses
of
attention
as
coherent
successions
each
with
its
rise
and
fall
the
similarly
only
relatively
far
more
brief
the
words
not
separately
but
in
connected
groups
in
short
empty
our
minds
as
we
may
some
form
of
remains
for
us
to
feel
and
can
not
be
expelled
and
along
with
the
sense
of
the
process
and
its
rhythm
goes
the
sense
of
the
length
of
time
it
lasts
awareness
of
is
thus
the
condition
on
which
our
perception
of
time
flow
depends
but
there
exists
no
reason
to
suppose
that
empty
time
own
changes
are
sufficient
for
the
awareness
of
change
to
be
aroused
the
change
must
be
of
some
concrete
sort
of
longer
in
the
experience
of
watching
empty
time
flow
to
be
taken
hereafter
in
the
relative
sense
just
set
forth
we
tell
it
off
in
pulses
we
say
now
now
or
we
count
more
more
as
we
feel
it
bud
this
composition
out
of
units
of
duration
is
called
the
law
of
time
the
discreteness
is
however
merely
due
to
the
fact
that
our
successive
acts
of
or
of
it
is
are
discrete
the
sensation
is
as
continuous
as
any
sensation
can
be
all
continuous
sensations
are
in
beats
we
notice
that
a
certain
finite
of
them
is
passing
or
already
past
to
adopt
hodgson
image
the
sensation
is
the
the
perception
the
which
stamps
its
length
as
we
listen
to
a
steady
sound
we
it
in
discrete
pulses
of
recognition
calling
it
successively
same
the
same
the
same
the
case
stands
no
otherwise
with
time
after
a
small
number
of
beats
our
impression
of
the
amount
we
have
told
off
becomes
quite
vague
our
only
way
of
knowing
it
accurately
is
by
counting
or
noticing
the
clock
or
through
some
other
symbolic
conception
when
the
times
exceed
hours
or
days
the
conception
is
absolutely
symbolic
we
think
of
the
amount
we
mean
either
solely
as
a
or
by
running
over
a
few
salient
therein
with
no
pretence
of
imagining
the
full
durations
that
lie
between
them
no
one
has
anything
like
a
of
the
greater
length
of
the
time
between
now
and
the
first
century
than
of
that
between
now
and
the
tenth
to
an
historian
it
is
true
the
longer
interval
will
suggest
a
host
of
additional
dates
and
events
and
so
appear
a
more
thing
and
for
the
same
reason
most
people
will
think
they
directly
perceive
the
length
of
the
past
fortnight
to
exceed
that
of
the
past
week
but
there
is
properly
no
comparative
in
these
cases
at
all
it
is
but
dates
and
events
representing
time
their
abundance
symbolizing
its
length
i
am
sure
that
this
is
so
even
where
the
times
compared
are
no
more
than
an
hour
or
so
in
length
it
is
the
same
with
spaces
of
many
miles
which
we
always
compare
with
each
other
by
the
numbers
that
measure
them
from
this
we
pass
naturally
to
speak
of
certain
familiar
variations
in
our
estimation
of
lengths
of
time
general
a
time
filled
with
varied
and
interesting
experiences
seems
short
in
passing
but
long
as
we
look
back
on
the
other
hand
a
tract
of
time
empty
of
experiences
seems
long
in
passing
but
in
retrospect
a
week
of
travel
and
may
subtend
an
angle
more
like
three
weeks
in
the
memory
and
a
month
of
sickness
yields
hardly
more
memories
than
a
day
the
length
in
retrospect
depends
obviously
on
the
multitudinousness
of
the
memories
which
the
time
affords
many
objects
events
changes
many
subdivisions
immediately
widen
the
view
as
we
look
back
emptiness
monotony
familiarity
make
it
shrivel
up
same
space
of
time
seems
shorter
as
we
grow
that
is
the
days
the
months
and
the
years
do
so
whether
the
hours
do
so
is
doubtful
and
the
minutes
and
seconds
to
all
appearance
remain
about
the
same
an
old
man
probably
does
not
his
past
life
to
be
any
longer
than
he
did
when
he
was
a
boy
though
it
may
be
a
dozen
times
as
long
in
most
men
all
the
events
of
manhood
years
are
of
such
familiar
that
the
individual
impressions
do
not
last
at
the
same
time
more
and
more
of
the
earlier
events
get
forgotten
the
result
being
that
no
greater
multitude
of
distinct
objects
remains
in
the
memory
so
much
for
the
apparent
shortening
of
tracts
of
time
in
they
shorten
whenever
we
are
so
fully
occupied
with
their
content
as
not
to
note
the
actual
time
itself
a
day
full
of
excitement
with
no
pause
is
said
to
pass
we
know
it
on
the
contrary
a
day
full
of
waiting
of
unsatisfied
desire
for
change
will
seem
a
small
eternity
are
words
for
which
probably
every
language
known
to
man
has
its
equivalent
it
comes
about
whenever
from
the
relative
emptiness
of
content
of
a
tract
of
time
we
grow
attentive
to
the
passage
of
the
time
itself
expecting
and
being
ready
for
a
new
impression
to
succeed
when
it
fails
to
come
we
get
an
empty
time
instead
of
it
and
such
experiences
ceaselessly
renewed
make
us
most
formidably
aware
of
the
extent
of
the
mere
time
itself
close
your
eyes
and
simply
wait
to
hear
somebody
tell
you
that
a
minute
has
elapsed
and
the
full
length
of
your
leisure
with
it
seems
incredible
you
engulf
yourself
into
its
bowels
as
into
those
of
that
interminable
first
week
of
an
ocean
voyage
and
find
yourself
wondering
that
history
can
have
overcome
many
such
periods
in
its
course
all
because
you
attend
so
closely
to
the
mere
feeling
of
the
time
and
because
your
attention
to
that
is
susceptible
of
such
successive
subdivision
the
of
the
whole
experience
comes
from
its
insipidity
for
is
the
indispensable
requisite
for
pleasure
in
an
experience
and
the
feeling
of
bare
time
is
the
least
stimulating
experience
we
can
have
the
sensation
of
tedium
is
a
says
volkmann
against
the
entire
present
feeling
of
past
time
is
a
present
in
reflecting
on
the
of
our
consciousness
of
time
we
are
at
first
tempted
to
suppose
it
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
understand
our
inner
states
succeed
each
other
they
know
themselves
as
they
are
then
of
course
we
say
they
must
know
their
own
succession
but
this
philosophy
is
too
crude
for
between
the
mind
own
changes
successive
and
their
own
lies
as
broad
a
chasm
as
between
the
object
and
subject
of
any
case
of
cognition
in
the
world
succession
of
feelings
in
and
of
itself
is
not
a
feeling
of
succession
and
since
to
our
successive
feelings
a
feeling
of
their
succession
is
added
that
must
be
treated
as
an
additional
fact
requiring
its
own
special
which
this
talk
about
the
feelings
knowing
their
as
a
matter
of
course
leaves
all
untouched
if
we
represent
the
actual
of
our
thinking
by
an
horizontal
line
the
thought
the
stream
or
of
any
segment
of
its
length
past
present
or
to
come
might
be
figured
in
a
perpendicular
raised
upon
the
horizontal
at
a
certain
point
the
length
of
this
perpendicular
stands
for
a
certain
object
or
content
which
in
this
case
is
the
time
thought
of
at
the
actual
moment
of
the
stream
upon
which
the
perpendicular
is
raised
there
is
thus
a
sort
of
of
past
objects
upon
present
consciousness
similar
to
that
of
wide
landscapes
upon
a
and
since
we
saw
a
while
ago
that
our
maximum
distinct
of
duration
hardly
covers
more
than
a
dozen
seconds
while
our
maximum
vague
perception
is
probably
not
more
than
that
of
a
minute
or
so
we
must
suppose
that
amount
of
duration
is
pictured
fairly
steadily
in
each
passing
instant
of
by
virtue
of
some
fairly
constant
feature
in
the
to
which
the
consciousness
is
tied
feature
of
the
whatever
it
be
must
be
the
cause
of
our
perceiving
the
fact
of
time
at
the
duration
thus
steadily
perceived
is
hardly
more
than
the
present
as
it
was
called
a
few
pages
back
its
is
in
a
constant
flux
events
dawning
into
its
forward
end
as
fast
as
they
fade
out
of
its
rearward
one
and
each
of
them
changing
its
from
yet
or
quite
yet
to
gone
or
as
it
passes
by
meanwhile
the
specious
present
the
intuited
duration
stands
permanent
like
the
rainbow
on
the
waterfall
with
its
own
quality
unchanged
by
the
events
that
stream
through
it
each
of
these
as
it
slips
out
retains
the
power
of
being
reproduced
and
when
reproduced
is
reproduced
with
the
duration
and
neighbors
which
it
originally
had
please
observe
however
that
the
reproduction
of
an
event
it
has
once
completely
dropped
out
of
the
rearward
end
of
the
specious
present
is
an
entirely
different
psychic
fact
from
its
direct
perception
in
the
specious
present
as
a
thing
immediately
past
a
creature
might
be
entirely
devoid
of
memory
and
yet
have
the
but
the
latter
would
be
limited
in
his
case
to
the
few
seconds
immediately
passing
by
in
the
next
chapter
assuming
the
sense
of
time
as
given
we
will

analysis
of

chapter

memory
of
the
phenomenon
of
memory
proper
or
secondary
memory
as
it
might
be
styled
is
the
knowledge
of
a
former
state
of
mind
after
it
has
already
once
dropped
from
consciousness
or
rather
is
the
knowledge
of
an
event
or
of
which
meantime
we
have
not
been
thinking
the
additional
consciousness
that
we
have
thought
or
experienced
it
the
first
element
which
such
a
knowledge
involves
would
seem
to
be
the
revival
in
the
mind
of
an
image
or
copy
of
the
original
event
and
it
is
an
assumption
made
by
many
writers
that
such
revival
of
an
image
is
all
that
is
needed
to
constitute
the
memory
of
the
original
occurrence
but
such
a
revival
is
obviously
not
a
whatever
else
it
may
be
it
is
simply
a
duplicate
a
second
event
having
absolutely
no
connection
with
the
first
event
except
that
it
happens
to
resemble
it
the
clock
strikes
it
struck
yesterday
and
may
strike
a
million
times
ere
it
wears
out
the
rain
pours
through
the
gutter
this
week
it
did
so
last
week
and
will
do
so
sÃ¦cula
but
does
the
present
become
aware
of
the
past
ones
or
the
present
stream
recollect
the
past
stream
because
they
repeat
and
resemble
them
assuredly
not
and
let
it
not
be
said
that
this
is
because
and
gutters
are
physical
and
not
psychical
objects
for
psychical
objects
sensations
for
example
simply
recurring
in
successive
editions
will
remember
each
other
that
no
more
than
do
no
memory
is
involved
in
the
mere
fact
of
recurrence
the
successive
editions
of
a
feeling
are
so
many
independent
events
each
snug
in
its
own
skin
yesterday
feeling
is
dead
and
buried
and
the
presence
of
is
no
reason
why
it
should
resuscitate
along
with
a
farther
condition
is
required
before
the
present
image
can
be
held
to
stand
for
a
that
condition
is
that
the
fact
imaged
be
referred
to
the
thought
as
the
but
how
can
we
think
a
thing
as
in
the
past
except
by
thinking
of
the
past
together
with
the
thing
and
of
the
relation
of
the
two
and
how
can
we
think
of
the
past
in
the
chapter
on
we
have
seen
that
our
intuitive
or
immediate
consciousness
of
pastness
hardly
carries
us
more
than
a
few
seconds
backward
of
the
present
instant
of
time
remoter
dates
are
conceived
not
perceived
known
symbolically
by
names
such
as
week
or
thought
of
by
events
which
happened
in
them
as
the
year
in
which
we
attended
such
a
school
or
met
with
such
a
loss
so
that
if
we
wish
to
think
of
a
particular
past
epoch
we
must
think
of
a
name
or
other
symbol
or
else
of
certain
concrete
events
associated
therewithal
both
must
be
thought
of
to
think
the
past
epoch
adequately
and
to
any
special
fact
to
the
past
epoch
is
to
think
that
fact
the
names
and
events
which
characterize
its
date
to
think
it
in
short
with
a
lot
of
contiguous
associates
but
even
this
would
not
be
memory
memory
requires
more
than
mere
dating
of
a
fact
in
the
past
it
must
be
dated
in
past
in
other
words
i
must
think
that
i
directly
experienced
its
occurrence
it
must
have
that
and
intimacy
which
were
so
often
spoken
of
in
the
chapter
on
the
self
as
characterizing
all
experiences
by
the
thinker
as
his
own
a
general
feeling
of
the
past
direction
in
time
then
a
particular
date
conceived
as
lying
along
that
direction
and
defined
by
its
name
or
phenomenal
contents
an
event
imagined
as
located
therein
and
owned
as
part
of
my
experience
such
are
the
elements
of
every
object
of
memory
and
such
being
the
phenomenon
of
memory
or
the
analysis
of
its
object
can
we
see
how
it
comes
to
pass
can
we
lay
bare
its
causes
its
complete
exercise
presupposes
two
things
the
of
the
remembered
fact
and
its
or
now
cause
both
of
retention
and
of
recollection

it

of

explained

james
mill
gives
an
account
of
it
which
i
am
unable
to
improve
upon
unless
it
might
be
by
translating
his
word
into
thought
of
or
there
is
he
says
a
state
of
mind
familiar
to
all
men
in
which
we
are
said
to
remember
in
this
state
it
is
certain
we
have
not
in
the
mind
the
idea
which
we
are
trying
to
have
in
it
how
is
it
then
that
we
proceed
in
the
course
of
our
endeavor
to
procure
its
introduction
into
the
mind
if
we
have
not
the
idea
itself
we
have
certain
ideas
connected
with
it
we
run
over
those
ideas
one
after
another
in
hopes
that
some
one
of
them
will
suggest
the
idea
we
are
in
quest
of
and
if
any
one
of
them
does
it
is
always
one
so
connected
with
it
as
to
call
it
up
in
the
way
of
association
i
meet
an
old
acquaintance
whose
name
i
do
not
remember
and
wish
to
recollect
i
run
over
a
number
of
names
in
hopes
that
some
of
them
may
be
associated
with
the
idea
of
the
individual
i
think
of
all
the
circumstances
in
which
i
have
seen
him
engaged
the
time
when
i
knew
him
the
persons
along
with
whom
i
knew
him
the
things
he
did
or
the
things
he
suffered
and
if
i
chance
upon
any
idea
with
which
the
name
is
associated
then
immediately
i
have
the
recollection
if
not
my
pursuit
of
it
is
vain
there
is
another
set
of
cases
very
familiar
but
affording
very
important
evidence
on
the
subject
it
frequently
happens
that
there
are
matters
which
we
desire
not
to
forget
what
is
the
contrivance
to
which
we
have
recourse
for
preserving
the
memory
that
is
for
making
sure
that
it
will
be
called
into
existence
when
it
is
our
wish
that
it
should
all
men
invariably
employ
the
same
expedient
they
endeavor
to
form
an
association
between
the
idea
of
the
thing
to
be
remembered
and
some
sensation
or
some
idea
which
they
know
beforehand
will
occur
at
or
near
the
time
when
they
wish
the
remembrance
to
be
in
their
minds
if
this
association
is
formed
and
the
association
or
idea
with
which
it
has
been
formed
occurs
the
sensation
or
idea
calls
up
the
remembrance
and
the
object
of
him
who
formed
the
association
is
attained
to
use
a
vulgar
instance
a
man
receives
a
commission
from
his
friend
and
that
he
may
not
forget
it
ties
a
knot
in
his
handkerchief
how
is
this
fact
to
be
explained
first
of
all
the
idea
of
the
commission
is
associated
with
the
making
of
the
knot
next
the
handkerchief
is
a
thing
which
it
is
known
beforehand
will
be
frequently
seen
and
of
course
at
no
great
distance
of
time
from
the
occasion
on
which
the
memory
is
desired
the
handkerchief
being
seen
the
knot
is
seen
and
this
sensation
recalls
the
idea
of
the
commission
between
which
and
itself
the
association
had
been
purposely
formed
in
short
we
make
search
in
our
memory
for
a
forgotten
idea
just
as
we
rummage
our
house
for
a
lost
object
in
both
cases
we
visit
what
seems
to
us
the
probable
of
that
which
we
miss
we
turn
over
the
things
under
which
or
within
which
or
alongside
of
which
it
may
possibly
be
and
if
it
lies
near
them
it
soon
comes
to
view
but
these
matters
in
the
case
of
a
mental
object
sought
are
nothing
but
its
the
machinery
of
recall
is
thus
the
same
as
the
machinery
of
association
and
the
machinery
of
association
as
we
know
is
nothing
but
the
elementary
law
of
habit
in
the
also
explains
and
this
same
law
of
habit
is
the
machinery
of
retention
also
retention
means
to
recall
and
it
means
nothing
more
than
such
liability
the
only
proof
of
there
being
retention
is
that
recall
actually
takes
place
the
retention
of
an
experience
is
in
short
but
another
name
for
the
of
thinking
it
again
or
the
to
think
it
again
with
its
past
surroundings
whatever
accidental
cue
may
turn
this
tendency
into
an
actuality
the
permanent
of
the
tendency
itself
lies
in
the
organized
neural
paths
by
which
the
cue
calls
up
the
memorable
experience
the
past
associates
the
sense
that
the
self
was
there
the
belief
that
it
all
really
happened
as
previously
described
when
the
recollection
is
of
the
sort
the
resuscitation
takes
place
the
instant
the
cue
arises
when
it
is
slow
resuscitation
comes
after
delay
but
be
the
recall
prompt
or
slow
the
condition
which
makes
it
possible
at
all
or
in
other
words
the
of
the
experience
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
which
the
experience
with
the
occasion
and
cue
of
the
recall
slumbering
these
paths
are
the
condition
of
retention
when
active
they
are
the
condition
of
illustration
fig
a
simple
scheme
will
now
make
the
whole
cause
of
memory
plain
let
be
a
past
event
its
concomitants
date
self
present
warmth
and
intimacy
as
already
set
forth
and
some
present
thought
or
fact
which
may
appropriately
become
the
occasion
of
its
recall
let
the
active
in
the
thought
of
and
be
represented
by
and
respectively
then
the
of
the
symbolized
by
the
lines
between
and
and
and
will
be
the
fact
indicated
by
the
phrase
of
the
event
in
the
memory
and
the
of
the
brain
along
these
paths
will
be
the
condition
of
the
event
actual
recall
the
of
it
will
be
observed
is
no
mysterious
storing
up
of
an
in
an
unconscious
state
it
is
not
a
fact
of
the
mental
order
at
all
it
is
a
purely
physical
phenomenon
a
morphological
feature
the
presence
of
these
namely
in
the
finest
recesses
of
the
brain
tissue
the
recall
or
recollection
on
the
other
hand
is
a
phenomenon
with
both
a
bodily
and
a
mental
side
the
bodily
side
is
the
excitement
of
the
paths
in
question
the
mental
side
is
the
conscious
representation
of
the
past
occurrence
and
the
belief
that
we
experienced
it
before
the
only
hypothesis
in
short
to
which
the
facts
of
inward
experience
give
countenance
is
that
excited
by
the
event
proper
and
those
excited
in
its
recall
are
in
different
each
if
we
could
revive
the
past
event
without
any
associates
we
should
exclude
the
possibility
of
memory
and
simply
dream
that
we
were
undergoing
the
experience
as
if
for
the
first
time
wherever
in
fact
the
recalled
event
does
appear
without
a
definite
setting
it
is
hard
to
distinguish
it
from
a
mere
creation
of
fancy
but
in
proportion
as
its
image
lingers
and
recalls
associates
which
gradually
become
more
definite
it
grows
more
and
more
distinctly
into
a
remembered
thing
for
example
i
enter
a
friend
room
and
see
on
the
wall
a
painting
at
first
i
have
the
strange
wondering
consciousness
i
have
seen
that
before
but
when
or
how
does
not
become
clear
there
only
clings
to
the
picture
a
sort
of
penumbra
of
familiarity
when
suddenly
i
exclaim
i
have
it
it
is
a
copy
of
part
of
one
of
the
fra
angelicos
in
the
florentine
academy
i
recollect
it
there
only
when
the
image
of
the
academy
arises
does
the
picture
become
remembered
as
well
as
seen
conditions
of
goodness
in
the
remembered
fact
being
then
the
path
n
o
is
what
arouses
for
its
setting
when
it
recalled
and
makes
it
other
than
a
mere
imagination
the
path
m
n
on
the
other
hand
gives
the
cue
or
occasion
of
its
being
recalled
at
all
being
thus
altogether
conditioned
on
its
excellence
in
a
given
individual
will
depend
partly
on
number
partly
on
persistence
these
the
persistence
or
permanence
of
the
paths
is
a
physiological
property
of
the
of
the
individual
whilst
their
number
is
altogether
due
to
the
facts
of
his
mental
experience
let
the
quality
of
permanence
in
the
paths
be
called
the
native
tenacity
or
physiological
retentiveness
this
tenacity
differs
enormously
from
infancy
to
old
age
and
from
one
person
to
another
some
minds
are
like
wax
under
a
seal
no
impression
however
disconnected
with
others
is
wiped
out
others
like
a
jelly
vibrate
to
every
touch
but
under
usual
conditions
retain
no
permanent
mark
these
latter
minds
before
they
can
recollect
a
fact
must
weave
it
into
their
permanent
stores
of
knowledge
they
have
no
memory
those
persons
on
the
contrary
who
retain
names
dates
and
addresses
anecdotes
gossip
poetry
quotations
and
all
sorts
of
miscellaneous
facts
without
an
effort
have
desultory
memory
in
a
high
degree
and
certainly
owe
it
to
the
unusual
tenacity
of
their
for
any
path
once
formed
therein
no
one
probably
was
ever
effective
on
a
voluminous
scale
without
a
high
degree
of
this
physiological
retentiveness
in
the
practical
as
in
the
theoretic
life
the
man
whose
acquisitions
is
the
man
who
is
always
achieving
and
advancing
whilst
his
neighbors
spending
most
of
their
time
in
relearning
what
they
once
knew
but
have
forgotten
simply
hold
their
own
a
charlemagne
a
luther
a
leibnitz
a
walter
scott
any
example
in
short
of
your
quarto
or
folio
editions
of
mankind
must
needs
have
amazing
retentiveness
of
the
purely
physiological
sort
men
without
this
retentiveness
may
excel
in
the
of
their
work
at
this
point
or
at
that
but
will
never
do
such
mighty
sums
of
it
or
be
influential
contemporaneously
on
such
a
scale
but
there
comes
a
time
of
life
for
all
of
us
when
we
can
do
no
more
than
hold
our
own
in
the
way
of
acquisitions
when
the
old
paths
fade
as
fast
as
the
new
ones
form
in
our
brain
and
when
we
forget
in
a
week
quite
as
much
as
we
can
learn
in
the
same
space
of
time
this
equilibrium
may
last
many
many
years
in
extreme
old
age
it
is
upset
in
the
reverse
direction
and
forgetting
prevails
over
acquisition
or
rather
there
is
no
acquisition
are
so
transient
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
of
conversation
the
same
question
is
asked
and
its
answer
forgotten
half
a
dozen
times
then
the
superior
tenacity
of
the
paths
formed
in
childhood
becomes
manifest
the
dotard
will
retrace
the
facts
of
his
earlier
years
after
he
has
lost
all
those
of
later
date
so
much
for
the
permanence
of
the
paths
now
for
their
number
it
is
obvious
that
the
more
there
are
of
such
paths
as
m
n
in
the
brain
and
the
more
of
such
possible
cues
or
occasions
for
the
recall
of
in
the
mind
the
prompter
and
surer
on
the
whole
the
memory
of
will
be
the
more
frequently
one
will
be
reminded
of
it
the
more
avenues
of
approach
to
it
one
will
possess
in
mental
terms
more
other
facts
a
fact
is
associated
with
in
the
mind
the
better
possession
of
it
our
memory
each
of
its
associates
becomes
a
hook
to
which
it
hangs
a
means
to
fish
it
up
by
when
sunk
beneath
the
surface
together
they
form
a
network
of
attachments
by
which
it
is
woven
into
the
entire
tissue
of
our
thought
the
of
a
good
memory
is
thus
the
secret
of
forming
diverse
and
multiple
associations
with
every
fact
we
care
to
retain
but
this
forming
of
associations
with
a
fact
what
is
it
but
the
fact
as
much
as
possible
briefly
then
of
two
men
with
the
same
outward
experiences
and
the
same
amount
of
mere
native
tenacity
one
thinks
his
experiences
most
and
weaves
them
into
systematic
relations
with
each
other
will
be
the
one
with
the
best
we
see
examples
of
this
on
every
hand
most
men
have
a
good
memory
for
facts
connected
with
their
own
pursuits
the
college
athlete
who
remains
a
dunce
at
his
books
will
astonish
you
by
his
knowledge
of
men
in
various
feats
and
games
and
will
be
a
walking
dictionary
of
sporting
statistics
the
reason
is
that
he
is
constantly
going
over
these
things
in
his
mind
and
comparing
and
making
series
of
them
they
form
for
him
not
so
many
odd
facts
but
a
so
they
stick
so
the
merchant
remembers
prices
the
politician
other
politicians
speeches
and
votes
with
a
copiousness
which
amazes
outsiders
but
which
the
amount
of
thinking
they
bestow
on
these
subjects
easily
explains
the
great
memory
for
facts
which
a
darwin
and
a
spencer
reveal
in
their
books
is
not
incompatible
with
the
possession
on
their
part
of
a
brain
with
only
a
middling
degree
of
physiological
retentiveness
let
a
man
early
in
life
set
himself
the
task
of
verifying
such
a
theory
as
that
of
evolution
and
facts
will
soon
cluster
and
cling
to
him
like
grapes
to
their
stem
their
relations
to
the
theory
will
hold
them
fast
and
the
more
of
these
the
mind
is
able
to
discern
the
greater
the
erudition
will
become
meanwhile
the
theorist
may
have
little
if
any
desultory
memory
unutilizable
facts
may
be
unnoted
by
him
and
forgotten
as
soon
as
heard
an
ignorance
almost
as
encyclopÃ¦dic
as
his
erudition
may
coexist
with
the
latter
and
hide
as
it
were
in
the
interstices
of
its
web
those
who
have
had
much
to
do
with
scholars
and
will
readily
think
of
examples
of
the
class
of
mind
i
mean
in
a
system
every
fact
is
connected
with
every
other
by
some
the
consequence
is
that
every
fact
is
retained
by
the
combined
suggestive
power
of
all
the
other
facts
in
the
system
and
forgetfulness
is
impossible
reason
why
cramming
is
such
a
bad
mode
of
is
now
made
clear
i
mean
by
cramming
that
way
of
preparing
for
examinations
by
committing
to
memory
during
a
few
hours
or
days
of
intense
application
immediately
preceding
the
final
ordeal
little
or
no
work
having
been
performed
during
the
previous
course
of
the
term
things
learned
thus
in
a
few
hours
on
one
occasion
for
one
purpose
can
not
possibly
have
formed
many
associations
with
other
things
in
the
mind
their
are
led
into
by
few
paths
and
are
relatively
little
liable
to
be
awakened
again
speedy
oblivion
is
the
almost
inevitable
fate
of
all
that
is
committed
to
memory
in
this
simple
way
whereas
on
the
contrary
the
same
materials
taken
in
gradually
day
after
day
recurring
in
different
contexts
considered
in
various
relations
associated
with
other
external
incidents
and
repeatedly
reflected
on
grow
into
such
a
system
form
such
connections
with
the
rest
of
the
mind
fabric
lie
open
to
so
many
paths
of
approach
that
they
remain
permanent
possessions
this
is
the
reason
why
habits
of
continuous
application
should
be
enforced
in
educational
establishments
of
course
there
is
no
moral
turpitude
in
cramming
did
it
lead
to
the
desired
end
of
secure
learning
it
were
infinitely
the
best
method
of
study
but
it
does
not
and
students
themselves
should
understand
the
reason
why
native
retentiveness
is
it
will
now
appear
clear
that
improvement
of
the
memory
lies
in
the
line
elaborating
the
associates
of
each
of
the
several
things
to
be
remembered
amount
of
culture
would
seem
capable
of
modifying
a
general
this
is
a
physiological
quality
given
once
for
all
with
his
organization
and
which
he
can
never
hope
to
change
it
differs
no
doubt
in
disease
and
health
and
it
is
a
fact
of
observation
that
it
is
better
in
fresh
and
vigorous
hours
than
when
we
are
fagged
or
we
may
say
then
that
a
man
native
tenacity
will
fluctuate
somewhat
with
his
hygiene
and
that
whatever
is
good
for
his
tone
of
health
will
also
be
good
for
his
memory
we
may
even
say
that
whatever
amount
of
intellectual
exercise
is
bracing
to
the
general
tone
and
nutrition
of
the
brain
will
also
be
profitable
to
the
general
retentiveness
but
more
than
this
we
can
not
say
and
this
it
is
obvious
is
far
less
than
most
people
believe
it
is
in
fact
commonly
thought
that
certain
exercises
systematically
repeated
will
strengthen
not
only
a
man
remembrance
of
the
particular
facts
used
in
the
exercises
but
his
faculty
for
remembering
facts
at
large
and
a
plausible
case
is
always
made
out
by
saying
that
practice
in
learning
words
by
heart
makes
it
easier
to
learn
new
words
in
the
same
way
if
this
be
true
then
what
i
have
just
said
is
false
and
the
whole
doctrine
of
memory
as
due
to
must
be
revised
but
i
am
disposed
to
think
the
alleged
fact
untrue
i
have
carefully
questioned
several
mature
actors
on
the
point
and
all
have
denied
that
the
practice
of
learning
parts
has
made
any
such
difference
as
is
alleged
what
it
has
done
for
them
is
to
improve
their
power
of
a
part
systematically
their
mind
is
now
full
of
precedents
in
the
way
of
intonation
emphasis
gesticulation
the
new
words
awaken
distinct
suggestions
and
decisions
are
caught
up
in
fact
into
a
preÃ«xisting
network
like
the
merchant
prices
or
the
athlete
store
of
and
are
recollected
easier
although
the
mere
native
tenacity
is
not
a
whit
improved
and
is
usually
in
fact
impaired
by
age
it
is
a
case
of
better
remembering
by
better
similarly
when
schoolboys
improve
by
practice
in
ease
of
learning
by
heart
the
improvement
will
i
am
sure
be
always
found
to
reside
in
the
of
study
of
the
particular
due
to
the
greater
interest
the
greater
suggestiveness
the
generic
similarity
with
other
pieces
the
more
sustained
attention
etc
and
not
at
all
to
any
enhancement
of
the
brute
retentive
power
the
error
i
speak
of
pervades
an
otherwise
useful
and
judicious
book
to
strengthen
the
memory
by
holbrook
of
new
york
the
author
fails
to
distinguish
between
the
general
physiological
retentiveness
and
the
retention
of
particular
things
and
talks
as
if
both
must
be
benefited
by
the
same
means
i
am
now
treating
he
says
a
case
of
loss
of
memory
in
a
person
advanced
in
years
who
did
not
know
that
his
memory
had
failed
most
remarkably
till
i
told
him
of
it
he
is
making
vigorous
efforts
to
bring
it
back
again
and
with
partial
success
the
method
pursued
is
to
spend
two
hours
daily
one
in
the
morning
and
one
in
the
evening
in
exercising
this
faculty
the
patient
is
instructed
to
give
the
closest
attention
to
all
that
he
learns
so
that
it
shall
be
impressed
on
his
mind
clearly
he
is
asked
to
recall
every
evening
all
the
facts
and
experiences
of
the
day
and
again
the
next
morning
every
name
heard
is
written
down
and
impressed
on
his
mind
clearly
and
an
effort
made
to
recall
it
at
intervals
ten
names
from
among
public
men
are
ordered
to
be
committed
to
memory
every
week
a
verse
of
poetry
is
to
be
learned
also
a
verse
from
the
bible
daily
he
is
asked
to
remember
the
number
of
the
page
in
any
book
where
any
interesting
fact
is
recorded
these
and
other
methods
are
slowly
resuscitating
a
failing
memory
i
find
it
very
hard
to
believe
that
the
memory
of
the
poor
old
gentleman
is
a
bit
the
better
for
all
this
torture
except
in
respect
of
the
particular
facts
thus
wrought
into
it
and
other
matters
that
may
have
been
connected
therewithal
the
all
improvement
of
memory
consists
then
in
the
improvement
of
one
methods
of
recording
methods
have
been
divided
into
the
mechanical
the
ingenious
and
the
judicious
the
consist
in
the
intensification
prolongation
and
of
the
impression
to
be
remembered
the
modern
method
of
teaching
children
to
read
by
blackboard
work
in
which
each
word
is
impressed
by
the
fourfold
channel
of
eye
ear
voice
and
hand
is
an
example
of
an
improved
mechanical
method
of
memorizing
of
remembering
things
are
nothing
but
logical
ways
of
conceiving
them
and
working
them
into
rational
systems
classifying
them
analyzing
them
into
parts
etc
all
the
sciences
are
such
methods
of
many
have
been
invented
under
the
name
of
technical
memories
by
means
of
these
systems
it
is
often
possible
to
retain
entirely
disconnected
facts
lists
of
names
numbers
and
so
forth
so
multitudinous
as
to
be
entirely
unrememberable
in
a
natural
way
the
method
consists
usually
in
a
framework
learned
mechanically
of
which
the
mind
is
supposed
to
remain
in
secure
and
permanent
possession
then
whatever
is
to
be
remembered
is
deliberately
associated
by
some
fanciful
analogy
or
connection
with
some
part
of
this
framework
and
this
connection
thenceforward
helps
its
recall
the
best
known
and
most
used
of
these
devices
is
the
to
remember
numbers
a
is
first
formed
in
which
each
numerical
digit
is
represented
by
one
or
more
letters
the
number
is
then
translated
into
such
letters
as
will
best
make
a
word
if
possible
a
word
suggestive
of
the
object
to
which
the
number
belongs
the
word
will
then
be
remembered
when
the
numbers
alone
might
be
forgotten
the
recent
system
of
loisette
is
a
method
much
less
mechanical
of
weaving
the
thing
into
associations
which
may
aid
its
recall
if
however
a
phenomenon
be
met
with
too
often
and
with
too
great
a
variety
of
contexts
although
its
image
is
retained
and
reproduced
with
correspondingly
great
facility
it
fails
to
come
up
with
any
one
particular
setting
and
the
projection
of
it
backwards
to
a
particular
past
date
consequently
does
not
come
about
we
but
do
not
it
its
associates
form
too
confused
a
cloud
a
similar
result
comes
about
when
a
definite
setting
is
only
nascently
aroused
we
then
feel
that
we
have
seen
the
object
already
but
when
or
where
we
can
not
say
though
we
may
seem
to
ourselves
to
be
on
the
brink
of
saying
it
that
nascent
cerebral
excitations
can
thus
affect
consciousness
is
obvious
from
what
happens
when
we
seek
to
remember
a
name
it
tingles
it
trembles
on
the
verge
but
does
not
come
just
such
a
tingling
and
trembling
of
unrecovered
associates
is
the
penumbra
of
recognition
that
may
surround
any
experience
and
make
it
seem
familiar
though
we
know
not
why
there
is
a
curious
experience
which
everyone
seems
to
have
had
the
feeling
that
the
present
moment
in
its
completeness
has
been
experienced
before
we
were
saying
just
this
thing
in
just
this
place
to
just
these
people
etc
this
of
preÃ«xistence
has
been
treated
as
a
great
mystery
and
occasioned
much
speculation
wigan
considered
it
due
to
a
dissociation
of
the
action
of
the
two
hemispheres
one
of
them
becoming
conscious
a
little
later
than
the
other
but
both
of
the
same
fact
i
must
confess
that
the
quality
of
mystery
seems
to
me
here
a
little
strained
i
have
over
and
over
again
in
my
own
case
succeeded
in
resolving
the
phenomenon
into
a
case
of
memory
so
indistinct
that
whilst
some
past
circumstances
are
presented
again
the
others
are
not
the
dissimilar
portions
of
the
past
do
not
arise
completely
enough
at
first
for
the
date
to
be
identified
all
we
get
is
the
present
scene
with
a
general
suggestion
of
pastness
about
it
that
faithful
observer
lazarus
interprets
the
phenomenon
in
the
same
way
and
it
is
noteworthy
that
just
as
soon
as
the
past
context
grows
complete
and
distinct
the
emotion
of
weirdness
fades
from
the
experience
in
the
practical
use
of
our
intellect
forgetting
is
as
important
a
function
as
remembering
recall
see
we
saw
to
be
comparatively
rare
in
association
if
we
remembered
everything
we
should
on
most
occasions
be
as
ill
off
as
if
we
remembered
nothing
it
would
take
as
long
for
us
to
recall
a
space
of
time
as
it
took
the
original
time
to
elapse
and
we
should
never
get
ahead
with
our
thinking
all
recollected
times
undergo
accordingly
what
ribot
calls
foreshortening
and
this
foreshortening
is
due
to
the
omission
of
an
enormous
number
of
the
facts
which
filled
them
we
thus
reach
the
paradoxical
result
says
ribot
that
one
condition
of
remembering
is
that
we
should
forget
without
totally
forgetting
a
prodigious
number
of
states
of
consciousness
and
momentarily
forgetting
a
large
number
we
could
not
remember
at
all
oblivion
except
in
certain
cases
is
thus
no
malady
of
memory
but
a
condition
of
its
health
and
its
life
hypnotic
subjects
as
a
rule
forget
all
that
has
happened
in
their
trance
but
in
a
succeeding
trance
they
will
often
remember
the
events
of
a
past
one
this
is
like
what
happens
in
those
cases
of
personality
in
which
no
recollection
of
one
of
the
lives
is
to
be
found
in
the
other
the
sensibility
in
these
cases
often
differs
from
one
of
the
alternate
personalities
to
another
the
patient
being
often
anÃ¦sthetic
in
certain
respects
in
one
of
the
secondary
states
now
the
memory
may
come
and
go
with
the
sensibility
pierre
janet
proved
in
various
ways
that
what
his
patients
forgot
when
anÃ¦sthetic
they
remembered
when
the
sensibility
returned
for
instance
he
restored
their
tactile
sense
temporarily
by
means
of
electric
currents
passes
and
then
made
them
handle
various
objects
such
as
keys
and
pencils
or
make
particular
movements
like
the
sign
of
the
cross
the
moment
the
anÃ¦sthesia
returned
they
found
it
impossible
to
recollect
the
objects
or
the
acts
had
had
nothing
in
their
hands
they
had
done
nothing
etc
the
next
day
however
sensibility
being
again
restored
by
similar
processes
they
remembered
perfectly
the
circumstance
and
told
what
they
had
handled
or
done
all
these
pathological
facts
are
showing
us
that
the
sphere
of
possible
recollection
may
be
wider
than
we
think
and
that
in
certain
matters
apparent
oblivion
is
no
proof
against
possible
recall
under
other
conditions
they
give
no
countenance
however
to
the
extravagant
opinion
that
absolutely
no
part
of
our
experience
can
be
forgotten

that
the

in

different

are
able
to
make

sharp
and
complete
has
had
something
to
do
with
keeping
up
such
philosophic
disputes
as
that
of
berkeley
with
locke
over
abstract
ideas
locke
had
spoken
of
our
possessing
general
idea
of
a
triangle
which
must
be
neither
oblique
nor
rectangle
neither
equilateral
equicrural
nor
scalenon
but
all
and
none
of
these
at
once
berkeley
says
if
any
man
has
the
faculty
of
framing
in
his
mind
such
an
idea
of
a
triangle
as
is
here
described
it
is
in
vain
to
pretend
to
dispute
him
out
of
it
nor
would
i
go
about
it
all
i
desire
is
that
the
reader
would
fully
and
certainly
inform
himself
whether
has
such
an
idea
or
no
until
very
recent
years
it
was
supposed
by
philosophers
that
there
was
a
typical
human
mind
which
all
individual
minds
were
like
and
that
propositions
of
universal
validity
could
be
laid
down
about
such
faculties
as
imagination
lately
however
a
mass
of
revelations
have
poured
in
which
make
us
see
how
false
a
view
this
is
there
are
imaginations
not
imagination
and
they
must
be
studied
in
detail
galton
in
began
a
statistical
inquiry
which
may
be
said
to
have
made
an
era
in
descriptive
psychology
he
addressed
a
circular
to
large
numbers
of
persons
asking
them
to
describe
the
image
in
their
mind
eye
of
their
on
a
given
morning
the
variations
were
found
to
be
enormous
and
strange
to
say
it
appeared
that
eminent
scientific
men
on
the
average
had
less
visualizing
power
than
younger
and
more
insignificant
persons
the
reader
will
find
details
in
galton
into
human
faculty
pp
i
have
myself
for
many
years
collected
from
each
and
all
of
my
descriptions
of
their
own
visual
imagination
and
found
together
with
some
curious
idiosyncrasies
corroboration
of
all
the
variations
which
galton
reports
as
examples
i
subjoin
extracts
from
two
cases
near
the
ends
of
the
scale
the
writers
are
first
cousins
grandsons
of
a
distinguished
man
of
science
the
one
who
is
a
good
visualizer
says
this
morning
is
both
dim
and
bright
it
is
dim
if
i
try
to
think
of
it
when
my
eyes
are
open
upon
any
object
it
is
perfectly
clear
and
bright
if
i
think
of
it
with
my
eyes
all
the
objects
are
clear
at
once
yet
when
i
confine
my
attention
to
any
one
object
it
becomes
far
more
i
have
more
power
to
recall
color
than
any
other
one
thing
if
for
example
i
were
to
recall
a
plate
decorated
with
flowers
i
could
reproduce
in
a
drawing
the
exact
tone
etc
the
color
of
anything
that
was
on
the
table
is
perfectly
there
is
very
little
limitation
to
the
extent
of
my
images
i
can
see
all
four
sides
of
a
room
i
can
see
all
four
sides
of
two
three
four
even
more
rooms
with
such
distinctness
that
if
you
should
ask
me
what
was
in
any
particular
place
in
any
one
or
ask
me
to
count
the
chairs
i
could
do
it
without
the
least
the
more
i
learn
by
heart
the
more
clearly
do
i
see
images
of
my
pages
even
before
i
can
recite
the
lines
i
see
them
so
that
i
could
give
them
very
slowly
word
for
word
but
my
mind
is
so
occupied
in
looking
at
my
printed
image
that
i
have
no
idea
of
what
i
am
saying
of
the
sense
of
it
etc
when
i
first
found
myself
doing
this
i
used
to
think
it
was
merely
because
i
knew
the
lines
imperfectly
but
i
have
quite
convinced
myself
that
i
really
do
see
an
image
the
strongest
proof
that
such
is
really
the
fact
is
i
think
the
following
i
can
look
down
the
mentally
seen
page
and
see
the
words
that
all
the
lines
and
from
any
one
of
these
words
i
can
continue
the
line
i
find
this
much
easier
to
do
if
the
words
begin
in
a
straight
line
than
if
there
are
breaks

la
fontaine
iv
the
poor
visualizer
says
my
ability
to
form
mental
images
seems
from
what
i
have
studied
of
other
people
images
to
be
defective
and
somewhat
peculiar
the
process
by
which
i
seem
to
remember
any
particular
event
is
not
by
a
series
of
distinct
images
but
a
sort
of
panorama
the
faintest
impressions
of
which
are
perceptible
through
a
thick
i
can
not
shut
my
eyes
and
get
a
distinct
image
of
anyone
although
i
used
to
be
able
to
a
few
years
ago
and
the
faculty
seems
to
have
gradually
slipped
in
my
most
vivid
dreams
where
the
events
appear
like
the
most
real
facts
i
am
often
troubled
with
a
dimness
of
sight
which
causes
the
images
to
appear
to
come
to
the
question
of
the
there
is
nothing
definite
about
it
everything
is
vague
i
can
not
say
i
see
i
could
not
possibly
count
the
chairs
but
i
happen
to
know
that
there
are
ten
i
see
nothing
in
the
chief
thing
is
a
general
impression
that
i
can
not
tell
exactly
what
i
do
see
the
coloring
is
about
the
same
as
far
as
i
can
recall
it
only
very
much
washed
out
perhaps
the
only
color
i
can
see
at
all
distinctly
is
that
of
the
and
i
could
probably
see
the
color
of
the
if
i
could
remember
what
color
it
was
a
person
whose
visual
imagination
is
strong
finds
it
hard
to
understand
how
those
who
are
without
the
faculty
can
think
at
all
people
undoubtedly
have
no
visual
images
at
all
worthy
of
the
and
instead
of
their
they
tell
you
that
they
it
or
what
was
on
it
the
of
which
this
is
made
seems
to
be
verbal
images
exclusively
but
if
the
words
and
lead
a
man
to
speak
to
his
cook
to
pay
his
bills
and
to
take
measures
for
the
morrow
meal
exactly
as
visual
and
gustatory
memories
would
why
are
they
not
for
all
practical
intents
and
purposes
as
good
a
kind
of
material
in
which
to
think
in
fact
we
may
suspect
them
to
be
for
most
purposes
better
than
terms
with
a
richer
imaginative
coloring
the
scheme
of
relationship
and
the
conclusion
being
the
essential
things
in
thinking
that
kind
of
which
is
handiest
will
be
the
best
for
the
purpose
now
words
uttered
or
unexpressed
are
the
handiest
mental
elements
we
have
not
only
are
they
very
revivable
but
they
are
revivable
as
actual
sensations
more
easily
than
any
other
items
of
our
experience
did
they
not
possess
some
such
advantage
as
this
it
would
hardly
be
the
case
that
the
older
men
are
and
the
more
effective
as
thinkers
the
more
as
a
rule
they
have
lost
their
visualizing
power
as
galton
found
to
be
the
case
with
members
of
the
royal
society
of
these
also
differ
in
individuals
those
who
think
by
preference
in
auditory
images
are
called
audiles
by
galton
says
binet
to
be
rarer
than
the
persons
of
this

professor
stricker
of
vienna
who
seems
to
be
a
or
to
have
this
form
of
imagination
developed
in
unusual
strength
has
given
a
careful
analysis
of
his
own
case
his
recollections
both
of
his
own
movements
and
of
those
of
other
things
are
accompanied
invariably
by
distinct
muscular
feelings
in
those
parts
of
his
body
which
would
naturally
be
used
in
effecting
or
in
following
the
movement
in
thinking
of
a
soldier
marching
for
example
it
is
as
if
he
were
helping
the
image
to
march
by
marching
himself
in
his
rear
and
if
he
suppresses
this
sympathetic
feeling
in
his
own
legs
and
concentrates
all
his
attention
on
the
imagined
soldier
the
latter
becomes
as
it
were
paralyzed
in
general
his
imagined
movements
of
whatsoever
objects
seem
paralyzed
the
moment
no
feelings
of
movement
either
in
his
own
eyes
or
in
his
own
limbs
accompany
them
the
movements
of
articulate
speech
play
a
predominant
part
in
his
mental
life
when
after
my
experimental
work
he
says
i
proceed
to
its
description
as
a
rule
i
reproduce
in
the
first
instance
only
words
which
i
had
already
associated
with
the
perception
of
the
various
details
of
the
observation
whilst
the
latter
was
going
on
for
speech
plays
in
all
my
observing
so
important
a
part
that
i
ordinarily
clothe
phenomena
in
words
as
fast
as
i
observe
them
most
persons
on
being
asked
what
sort
of
terms
they
imagine
will
say
terms
of
hearing
it
is
not
until
their
attention
is
expressly
drawn
to
the
point
that
they
find
it
difficult
to
say
whether
auditory
images
or
motor
images
connected
with
the
organs
of
articulation
predominate
a
good
way
of
bringing
the
difficulty
to
consciousness
is
that
proposed
by
stricker
partly
open
your
mouth
and
then
imagine
any
word
with
labials
or
dentals
in
it
such
as
is
your
image
under
these
conditions
distinct
to
most
people
the
image
is
at
first
as
the
sound
of
the
word
would
be
if
they
tried
to
pronounce
it
with
the
lips
parted
many
can
never
imagine
the
words
clearly
with
the
mouth
open
others
succeed
after
a
few
preliminary
trials
the
experiment
proves
how
dependent
our
verbal
imagination
is
on
actual
feelings
in
lips
tongue
throat
larynx
etc
bain
says
that
a
articulation
is
in
fact
the
material
of
our
the
intellectual
manifestation
the
of
speech
in
persons
whose
auditory
imagination
is
weak
the
articulatory
image
does
indeed
seem
to
constitute
the
whole
material
for
verbal
thought
professor
stricker
says
that
in
his
own
case
no
auditory
image
enters
into
the
words
of
which
he
thinks
of
these
are
very
strong
in
some
people
the
most
vivid
come
when
we
ourselves
barely
escape
local
injury
or
when
we
see
another
injured
the
place
may
then
actually
tingle
with
the
imaginary
sensation
perhaps
not
altogether
imaginary
since
paling
or
reddening
and
other
evidences
of
actual
muscular
contraction
in
the
spot
may
result
an
educated
man
says
herr
meyer
told
me
once
that
on
entering
his
house
one
day
he
received
a
shock
from
crushing
the
finger
of
one
of
his
little
children
in
the
door
at
the
moment
of
his
fright
he
felt
a
violent
pain
in
the
corresponding
finger
of
his
own
body
and
this
pain
abode
with
him
three
days
the
imagination
of
a
blind
like
laura
bridgman
must
be
confined
entirely
to
tactile
and
motor
material
blind
persons
must
belong
to
the
and
of
the
french
authors
when
the
young
man
whose
cataracts
were
removed
by
franz
was
shown
different
geometric
figures
he
said
he
had
not
been
able
to
form
from
them
the
idea
of
a
square
and
a
disk
until
he
perceived
a
sensation
of
what
he
saw
in
the
points
of
his
fingers
as
if
he
really
touched
the
objects
the
study
of
aphasia
see
has
of
late
years
shown
how
unexpectedly
individuals
differ
in
the
use
of
their
imagination
in
some
the
habitual
if
one
may
so
call
it
is
visual
in
others
it
is
auditory
articulatory
or
motor
in
most
perhaps
it
is
evenly
mixed
these
are
the
indifferents
of
charcot
the
same
local
cerebral
injury
must
needs
work
different
practical
results
in
persons
who
differ
in
this
way
in
one
what
is
thrown
out
of
gear
is
a
in
the
other
an
unimportant
region
is
affected
a
particularly
instructive
case
was
published
by
charcot
in
the
patient
was
a
merchant
an
exceedingly
accomplished
man
but
a
visualizer
of
the
most
exclusive
type
owing
to
some
accident
he
suddenly
lost
all
his
visual
images
and
with
them
much
of
his
intellectual
power
without
any
other
perversion
of
faculty
he
soon
discovered
that
he
could
carry
on
his
affairs
by
using
his
memory
in
an
altogether
new
way
and
described
clearly
the
difference
between
his
two
conditions
every
time
he
returns
to
from
which
place
business
often
calls
him
he
seems
to
himself
as
if
entering
a
strange
city
he
views
the
monuments
houses
and
streets
with
the
same
surprise
as
if
he
saw
them
for
the
first
time
when
asked
to
describe
the
principal
public
place
of
the
town
he
answered
know
that
it
is
there
but
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
it
and
i
can
tell
you
nothing
about
it
he
can
no
more
remember
his
wife
and
children
face
than
he
can
remember
a
even
after
being
with
them
some
time
they
seem
unusual
to
him
he
forgets
his
own
face
and
once
spoke
to
his
image
in
a
mirror
taking
it
for
a
stranger
he
complains
of
his
loss
of
feeling
for
colors
my
wife
has
black
hair
this
i
know
but
i
can
no
more
recall
its
color
than
i
can
her
person
and
features
this
visual
amnesia
extends
to
objects
dating
from
his
childhood
years
paternal
mansion
forgotten
no
other
disturbances
but
this
loss
of
visual
images
now
when
he
seeks
something
in
his
correspondence
he
must
rummage
among
the
letters
like
other
men
until
he
meets
the
passage
he
can
recall
only
the
first
few
verses
of
the
iliad
and
must
to
recite
homer
virgil
and
horace
figures
which
he
adds
he
must
now
whisper
to
himself
he
realizes
clearly
that
he
must
help
his
memory
out
with
auditory
images
which
he
does
with
effort
words
and
expressions
which
he
recalls
seem
now
to
echo
in
his
ear
an
altogether
novel
sensation
for
if
he
wishes
to
learn
by
heart
anything
a
series
of
phrases
for
example
he
must
them
several
times
so
as
to
impress
his
ear
when
later
he
repeats
the
thing
in
question
the
sensation
of
inward
hearing
which
precedes
articulation
rises
up
in
his
mind
this
feeling
was
formerly
unknown
to
him
such
a
man
would
have
suffered
relatively
little
inconvenience
if
his
images
for
hearing
had
been
those
suddenly
destroyed
neural
process
in
most
medical
writers
assume
that
the
cerebral
activity
on
which
imagination
depends
occupies
a
different
from
that
subserving
sensation
it
is
however
a
simpler
interpretation
of
the
facts
to
suppose
that
same
are
concerned
in
the
two
our
mental
images
are
aroused
always
by
way
of
association
some
previous
idea
or
sensation
must
have
them
association
is
surely
due
to
currents
from
one
cortical
centre
to
another
now
all
we
need
suppose
is
that
these
currents
are
unable
to
produce
in
the
cells
the
strong
explosions
which
currents
from
the
occasion
to
account
for
the
subjective
difference
between
images
and
sensations
without
supposing
any
difference
in
their
local
seat
to
the
strong
degree
of
explosion
corresponds
the
character
of
or
sensible
presence
in
the
object
of
thought
to
the
weak
degree
that
of
or
outward
unreality
if
we
admit
that
sensation
and
imagination
are
due
to
the
activity
of
the
same
parts
of
the
cortex
we
can
see
a
very
good
teleological
reason
why
they
should
correspond
to
discrete
kinds
of
process
in
these
centres
and
why
the
process
which
gives
the
sense
that
the
object
is
really
there
ought
normally
to
be
arousable
only
by
currents
entering
from
the
periphery
and
not
by
currents
from
the
neighboring
cortical
parts
we
can
see
in
short
why
sensational
ought
to
discontinuous
with
all
normal
ideational
processes
however
for
as
mÃ¼nsterberg
justly
observes
were
there
not
this
peculiar
arrangement
we
should
not
distinguish
reality
and
fantasy
our
conduct
would
not
be
accommodated
to
the
facts
about
us
but
would
be
inappropriate
and
senseless
and
we
could
not
keep
ourselves
alive
sometimes
by
exception
the
deeper
sort
of
explosion
may
take
place
from
excitement
alone
in
the
sense
of
hearing
sensation
and
imagination
hard
to
discriminate
where
the
sensation
is
so
weak
as
to
be
just
perceptible
at
night
hearing
a
very
faint
striking
of
the
hour
by
a
clock
our
imagination
reproduces
both
rhythm
and
sound
and
it
is
often
difficult
to
tell
which
was
the
last
real
stroke
so
of
a
baby
crying
in
a
distant
part
of
the
house
we
are
uncertain
whether
we
still
hear
it
or
only
imagine
the
sound
certain
take
advantage
of
this
in
diminuendo
terminations
after
the
pianissimo
has
been
reached
they
continue
to
bow
as
if
still
playing
but
are
careful
not
to
touch
the
strings
the
listener
hears
in
imagination
a
degree
of
sound
fainter
than
the
pianissimo
whether
of
sight
or
hearing
are
another
case
in
point
to
be
touched
on
in
the
next
chapter
i
may
mention
as
a
fact
still
unexplained
that
several
observers
herr

scott

of

have
noticed

perception
and
sensation
a
pure
sensation
we
saw
above
to
be
an
abstraction
never
realized
in
adult
life
anything
which
affects
our
does
also
more
than
that
it
arouses
processes
in
the
hemispheres
which
are
partly
due
to
the
organization
of
that
organ
by
past
experiences
and
the
results
of
which
in
consciousness
are
described
as
ideas
which
the
sensation
suggests
the
first
of
these
ideas
is
that
of
the
to
which
the
sensible
quality
belongs
consciousness
of
particular
material
things
present
to
is
nowadays
called
the
consciousness
of
such
things
may
be
more
or
less
complete
it
may
be
of
the
mere
name
of
the
thing
and
its
other
essential
attributes
or
it
may
be
of
the
thing
various
remoter
relations
it
is
impossible
to
draw
any
sharp
line
of
distinction
between
the
barer
and
the
richer
consciousness
because
the
moment
we
get
beyond
the
first
crude
sensation
all
our
consciousness
is
of
what
is
and
the
various
suggestions
shade
gradually
into
each
other
being
one
and
all
products
of
the
same
psychological
machinery
of
association
in
the
directer
consciousness
fewer
in
the
remoter
more
associative
processes
are
brought
into
play
and
reproductive
combined
then
are
what
give
us
the
content
of
our
every
concrete
particular
material
thing
is
a
conflux
of
sensible
qualities
with
which
we
have
become
acquainted
at
various
times
some
of
these
qualities
since
they
are
more
constant
interesting
or
practically
important
we
regard
as
essential
constituents
of
the
thing
in
a
general
way
such
are
the
tangible
shape
size
mass
etc
other
properties
being
more
fluctuating
we
regard
as
more
or
less
accidental
or
inessential
we
call
the
former
qualities
the
reality
the
latter
its
appearances
thus
i
hear
a
sound
and
say
but
the
sound
is
not
the
it
is
one
of
the
least
important
manifestations
the
real
is
a
feelable
or
at
most
a
feelable
and
visible
thing
which
in
my
imagination
the
sound
calls
up
so
when
i
get
as
now
a
brown
with
lines
not
parallel
and
with
angles
unlike
and
call
it
my
big
solid
rectangular
walnut
that
picture
is
not
the
table
it
is
not
even
like
the
table
as
the
table
is
for
vision
when
rightly
seen
it
is
a
distorted
perspective
view
of
three
of
the
sides
of
what
i
mentally
more
or
less
in
its
totality
and
undistorted
shape
the
back
of
the
table
its
square
corners
its
size
its
heaviness
are
features
of
which
i
am
conscious
when
i
look
almost
as
i
am
conscious
of
its
name
the
suggestion
of
the
name
is
of
course
due
to
mere
custom
but
no
less
is
that
of

the

nature
as
reid
says
is
frugal
in
her
operations
and
will
not
be
at
the
expense
of
a

instinct
to
give
us
that
knowledge
which
experience
and
habit
will
soon
produce
reproduced
attributes
tied
together
with
presently
felt
attributes
in

unity
of

these
are
the
materials
out
of
which
my
actually
perceived

is
made

go
through
a
long
education
of
the

and

they
can

adults
perceive
perception

an
acquired
perceptive
state
of

not
a
there
is
no
reason
however
for
supposing
that
this
involves
a
of
separate
sensations
and
ideas
the
thing
perceived
is
the
object
of
a
unique
state
of
thought
due
no
doubt
in
part
to
sensational
and
in
part
to
ideational
currents
but
in
no
wise
psychically
the
identical
and
images
which
these
currents
would
severally
have
aroused
if
the
others
were
not
simultaneously
there
we
can
often
directly
notice
a
sensible
difference
in
the
consciousness
between
the
latter
case
and
the
former

our
very
eye

one
may
read
this
over
and
over
again
without
recognizing
the
sounds
to
be
identical
with
those
of
the
words
your
own
as
the
english
associations
arise
the
sound
itself
appears
to
change
verbal
sounds
are
usually
perceived
with
their
meaning
at
the
moment
of
being
heard
sometimes
however
the
associative
irradiations
are
inhibited
for
a
few
moments
the
mind
being
preoccupied
with
other
thoughts
whilst
the
words
linger
on
the
ear
as
mere
echoes
of
acoustic
sensation
then
usually
their
interpretation
suddenly
occurs
but
at
that
moment
one
may
often
surprise
a
change
in
the
very
of
the
word
our
own
language
would
sound
very
different
to
us
if
we
heard
it
without
understanding
as
we
hear
a
foreign
tongue
rises
and
falls
of
voice
odd
sibilants
and
other
consonants
would
fall
on
our
ear
in
a
way
of
which
we
can
now
form
no
notion
frenchmen
say
that
english
sounds
to
them
like
the
des
an
impression
which
it
certainly
makes
on
no
native
ear
many
of
us
english
would
describe
the
sound
of
russian
in
similar
terms
all
of
us
are
conscious
of
the
strong
inflections
of
voice
and
explosives
and
gutturals
of
german
speech
in
a
way
in
which
no
german
can
be
conscious
of
them
this
is
probably
the
reason
why
if
we
look
at
an
isolated
printed
word
and
repeat
it
long
enough
it
ends
by
assuming
an
entirely
unnatural
aspect
let
the
reader
try
this
with
any
word
on
this
page
he
will
soon
begin
to
wonder
if
it
can
possibly
be
the
word
he
has
been
using
all
his
life
with
that
meaning
it
stares
at
him
from
the
paper
like
a
glass
eye
with
no
speculation
in
it
its
body
is
indeed
there
but
its
soul
is
fled
it
is
reduced
by
this
new
way
of
attending
to
it
to
its
sensational
nudity
we
never
before
attended
to
it
in
this
way
but
habitually
got
it
clad
with
its
meaning
the
moment
we
caught
sight
of
it
and
rapidly
passed
from
it
to
the
other
words
of
the
phrase
we
apprehended
it
in
short
with
a
cloud
of
associates
and
thus
perceiving
it
we
felt
it
quite
otherwise
than
as
we
feel
it
now
divested
and
alone
another
change
is
when
we
look
at
a
landscape
with
our
head
perception
is
to
a
certain
extent
baffled
by
this
manÅuvre
gradations
of
distance
and
other
are
made
uncertain
the
reproductive
or
associative
processes
in
short
decline
and
simultaneously
with
their
diminution
the
colors
grow
richer
and
more
varied
and
the
contrasts
of
light
and
shade
more
marked
the
same
thing
occurs
when
we
turn
a
painting
we
lose
much
of
its
meaning
but
to
compensate
for
the
loss
we
feel
more
freshly
the
value
of
the
mere
tints
and
shadings
and
become
aware
of
any
lack
of
purely
sensible
harmony
or
balance
which
they
may
show
just
so
if
we
lie
on
the
floor
and
look
up
at
the
mouth
of
a
person
talking
behind
us
his
lower
lip
here
takes
the
habitual
place
of
the
upper
one
upon
our
retina
and
seems
animated
by
the
most
extraordinary
and
unnatural
mobility
a
mobility
which
now
strikes
us
because
the
associative
processes
being
disturbed
by
the
unaccustomed
point
of
view
we
get
it
as
a
naked
sensation
and
not
as
part
of
a
familiar
object
perceived
once
more
then
we
find
ourselves
driven
to
admit
that
when
qualities
of
an
object
impress
our
sense
and
we
thereupon
perceive
the
object
the
pure
sensation
as
such
of
those
qualities
does
not
still
exist
inside
of
the
perception
and
form
a
constituent
thereof
the
pure
sensation
is
one
thing
and
the
perception
another
and
neither
can
take
place
at
the
same
time
with
the
other
because
their
cerebral
conditions
are
not
the
same
they
may
each
other
but
in
no
respect
are
they
identical
states
of
mind
is
of
definite
and
probable
the
chief
cerebral
conditions
of
perception
are
old
paths
of
association
radiating
from
the
if
a
certain
impression
be
strongly
associated
with
the
attributes
of
a
certain
thing
that
thing
is
almost
sure
to
be
perceived
when
we
get
the
impression
examples
of
such
things
would
be
familiar
people
places
which
we
recognize
and
name
at
a
glance
but
the
impression
is
associated
with
more
than
one
so
that
either
of
two
discrepant
sets
of
residual
properties
may
arise
the
perception
is
doubtful
and
vacillating
and
most
that
can
then
be
said
of
it
is
that
it
will
be
of
probable
of
the
thing
which
would
most
usually
have
given
us
that
sensation
in
these
ambiguous
cases
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
perception
is
rarely
abortive
perception
takes
place
the
two
discrepant
sets
of
associates
do
not
neutralize
each
other
or
mix
and
make
a
blur
what
we
more
commonly
get
is
first
one
object
in
its
completeness
and
then
the
other
in
its
completeness
in
other
words
are
such
as
give
rise
to
what
we
may
figured
if
paths
are
at
all
they
are
in
consistent
systems
and
occasion
thoughts
of
definite
objects
not
mere
of
elements
even
where
the
brain
functions
are
half
thrown
out
of
gear
as
in
aphasia
or
dropping
asleep
this
law
of
figured
consciousness
holds
good
a
person
who
suddenly
gets
sleepy
whilst
reading
aloud
will
read
wrong
but
instead
of
emitting
a
mere
broth
of
syllables
he
will
make
such
mistakes
as
to
read
instead
of
instead
of
or
indeed
utter
entirely
imaginary
phrases
composed
of
several
definite
words
instead
of
phrases
of
the
book
so
in
aphasia
where
the
disease
is
mild
the
patient
mistakes
consist
in
using
entire
wrong
words
instead
of
right
ones
it
is
only
in
grave
lesions
that
he
becomes
quite
inarticulate
these
facts
show
how
subtle
is
the
associative
link
how
delicate
yet
how
strong
that
connection
among
which
makes
any
number
of
them
once
excited
together
thereafter
tend
to
vibrate
as
a
systematic
whole
a
small
group
of
elements
common
to
two
systems
and
may
touch
off
or
according
as
accident
decides
the
next
step
see
fig
if
it
happen
that
a
single
point
leading
from
to
is
momentarily
a
little
more
pervious
than
any
leading
from
to
then
that
little
advantage
will
upset
the
equilibrium
in
favor
of
the
entire
system
the
currents
will
sweep
first
through
that
point
and
thence
into
all
the
paths
of
each
increment
of
advance
making
more
and
more
impossible
the
thoughts
correlated
with
and
in
such
a
case
will
have
objects
different
though
similar
the
similarity
will
however
consist
in
some
very
limited
feature
if
the
be
small
the
faintest
sensations
will
give
rise
to
the
perception
of
definite
things
if
only
they
resemble
those
which
the
things
are
wont
to
illustration
fig
let
us
now
for
brevity
sake
treat
and
in
fig
as
if
they
stood
for
objects
instead
of
and
let
us
furthermore
suppose
that
and
are
both
of
them
objects
which
might
probably
excite
the
sensation
which
i
have
called
but
that
on
the
present
occasion
and
not
is
the
one
which
actually
does
so
if
then
on
this
occasion
suggests
and
not
the
result
is
a
but
if
on
the
contrary
suggests
and
not
the
result
is
a
or
as
it
is
technically
called
an
but
the
is
the
same
whether
the
perception
be
true
or
false
note
that
in
every
illusion
what
is
false
is
what
is
inferred
not
what
is
immediately
given
the
if
it
were
felt
by
itself
alone
would
be
all
right
it
only
becomes
misleading
by
what
it
suggests
if
it
is
a
sensation
of
sight
it
may
suggest
a
tactile
object
for
example
which
later
tactile
experiences
prove
to
be
not
there
of
the
senses
of
which
the
ancient
sceptics
made
so
much
account
is
not
fallacy
of
the
senses
proper
but
rather
of
the
intellect
which
interprets
wrongly
what
the
senses
so
much
premised
let
us
look
a
little
closer
at
these
illusions
they
are
due
to
two
main
causes
wrong
object
is
perceived
either
not
on
this
occasion
the
real
cause
it
is
yet
the
habitual
inveterate
or
most
probable
cause
of
or
because
mind
is
temporarily
full
of
the
thought
of
that
object
and
therefore
is
peculiarly
prone
to
suggest
it
at
this
i
will
give
briefly
a
number
of
examples
under
each
head
the
first
head
is
the
more
important
because
it
includes
a
number
of
constant
illusions
to
which
all
men
are
subject
and
which
can
only
be
dispelled
by
much
experience
illustration
fig
of
the
first
one
of
the
oldest
instances
dates
from
aristotle
cross
two
fingers
and
roll
a
pea
penholder
or
other
small
object
between
them
it
will
seem
double
professor
croom
robertson
has
given
the
clearest
analysis
of
this
illusion
he
observes
that
if
the
object
be
brought
into
contact
first
with
the
forefinger
and
next
with
the
second
finger
the
two
contacts
seem
to
come
in
at
different
points
of
space
the
seems
higher
though
the
finger
is
really
lower
the
seems
lower
though
the
finger
is
really
higher
we
perceive
the
contacts
as
double
because
we
refer
them
to
two
distinct
parts
of
space
the
touched
sides
of
the
two
fingers
are
normally
not
together
in
space
and
customarily
never
do
touch
one
thing
the
one
thing
which
now
touches
them
therefore
seems
in
two
places
seems
two
things
there
is
a
whole
batch
of
illusions
which
come
from
optical
sensations
interpreted
by
us
in
accordance
with
our
usual
rule
although
they
are
now
produced
by
an
unusual
object
the
is
an
example
the
eyes
see
a
picture
apiece
and
the
two
pictures
are
a
little
disparate
the
one
seen
by
the
right
eye
being
a
view
of
the
object
taken
from
a
point
slightly
to
the
right
of
that
from
which
the
left
eye
picture
is
taken
pictures
thrown
on
the
two
eyes
by
solid
objects
present
this
sort
of
disparity
so
that
we
react
on
the
sensation
in
our
usual
way
and
perceive
a
solid
if
the
pictures
be
exchanged
we
perceive
a
hollow
mould
of
the
object
for
a
hollow
mould
would
cast
just
such
disparate
pictures
as
these
wheatstone
instrument
the
allows
us
to
look
at
solid
objects
and
see
with
each
eye
the
other
eye
picture
we
then
perceive
the
solid
object
hollow
it
be
an
object
which
might
probably
be
but
not
otherwise
thus
the
perceptive
process
is
true
to
its
law
which
is
to
react
on
the
sensation
in
a
determinate
and
figured
fashion
if
possible
and
in
as
probable
a
fashion
as
the
case
a
human
face
never
appears
hollow
to
the
pseudoscope
for
to
couple
faces
and
hollowness
violates
all
our
habits
for
the
same
reason
it
is
very
easy
to
make
an
intaglio
cast
of
a
face
or
the
painted
inside
of
a
pasteboard
mask
look
convex
instead
of
concave
as
they
are
illusions
of
in
objects
occur
whenever
the
eyeballs
move
without
our
intending
it
we
have
learned
in
an
earlier
chapter
that
the
original
visual
feeling
of
movement
is
produced
by
any
image
passing
over
the
retina
originally
however
this
sensation
is
definitely
referred
neither
to
the
object
nor
to
the
eyes
such
definite
reference
grows
up
later
and
obeys
certain
simple
laws
for
one
thing
we
believe
to
move
whenever
we
get
the
retinal
but
think
our
are
still
this
gives
rise
to
an
illusion
when
after
whirling
on
our
heel
we
stand
still
for
then
objects
appear
to
continue
whirling
in
the
same
direction
in
which
a
moment
previous
our
body
actually
whirled
the
reason
is
that
our
are
animated
under
these
conditions
by
an
involuntary
or
oscillation
in
their
orbits
which
may
easily
be
observed
in
anyone
with
vertigo
after
whirling
as
these
movements
are
unconscious
the
retinal
which
they
occasion
are
naturally
referred
to
the
objects
seen
the
whole
phenomenon
fades
out
after
a
few
seconds
and
it
ceases
if
we
voluntarily
fix
our
eyes
upon
a
given
point
there
is
an
illusion
of
movement
of
the
opposite
sort
with
which
every
one
is
familiar
at
habitually
when
we
ourselves
move
forward
our
entire
field
of
view
glides
backward
over
our
retina
when
our
movement
is
due
to
that
of
the
windowed
carriage
car
or
boat
in
which
we
sit
all
stationary
objects
visible
through
the
window
give
us
a
sensation
of
gliding
in
the
opposite
direction
hence
whenever
we
get
this
sensation
of
a
window
with
objects
visible
through
it
moving
in
one
direction
we
react
upon
it
in
our
customary
way
and
perceive
a
stationary
field
of
view
over
which
the
window
and
we
ourselves
inside
of
it
are
passing
by
a
motion
of
our
own
consequently
when
another
train
comes
alongside
of
ours
in
a
station
and
fills
the
entire
window
and
after
standing
still
awhile
begins
to
glide
away
we
judge
that
it
is
train
which
is
moving
and
that
the
other
train
is
still
if
however
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
any
part
of
the
station
through
the
windows
or
between
the
cars
of
the
other
train
the
illusion
of
our
own
movement
instantly
disappears
and
we
perceive
the
other
train
to
be
the
one
in
motion
this
again
is
but
making
the
usual
and
probable
inference
from
our
sensation
illusion
due
to
is
explained
by
helmholtz
most
wayside
objects
houses
trees
look
small
when
seen
from
the
windows
of
a
swift
train
this
is
because
we
perceive
them
in
the
first
instance
unduly
near
and
we
perceive
them
unduly
near
because
of
their
extraordinarily
rapid
parallactic
flight
backwards
when
we
ourselves
move
forward
all
objects
glide
backwards
as
aforesaid
but
the
nearer
they
are
the
more
rapid
is
this
apparent
translocation
relative
rapidity
of
passage
backwards
is
thus
so
familiarly
associated
with
nearness
that
when
we
feel
it
we
perceive
nearness
but
with
a
given
size
of
retinal
image
the
nearer
an
object
is
the
smaller
do
we
judge
its
actual
size
to
be
hence
in
the
train
the
faster
we
go
the
nearer
do
the
trees
and
houses
seem
and
the
nearer
they
seem
the
smaller
with
that
size
of
retinal
image
must
they
look
the
feelings
of
our
eyes
convergence
of
their
accommodation
the
size
of
the
retinal
image
may
give
rise
to
illusions
about
the
size
and
distance
of
objects
which
also
belong
to
this
first
type
of
the
second
in
this
type
we
perceive
a
wrong
object
because
our
mind
is
full
of
the
thought
of
it
at
the
time
and
any
sensation
which
is
in
the
least
degree
connected
with
it
touches
off
as
it
were
a
train
already
laid
and
gives
us
a
sense
that
the
object
is
really
before
us
here
is
a
familiar
example
if
a
sportsman
while
shooting
woodcock
in
cover
sees
a
bird
about
the
size
and
color
of
a
woodcock
get
up
and
fly
through
the
foliage
not
having
time
to
see
more
than
that
it
is
a
bird
of
such
a
size
and
color
he
immediately
supplies
by
inference
the
other
qualities
of
a
woodcock
and
is
afterwards
disgusted
to
find
that
he
has
shot
a
thrush
i
have
done
so
myself
and
could
hardly
believe
that
the
thrush
was
the
bird
i
fired
at
so
complete
was
my
mental
supplement
to
my
visual
perception
as
with
game
so
with
enemies
ghosts
and
the
like
anyone
waiting
in
a
dark
place
and
expecting
or
fearing
strongly
a
certain
object
will
interpret
any
abrupt
sensation
to
mean
that
object
presence
the
boy
playing
spy
the
criminal
skulking
from
his
pursuers
the
superstitious
person
hurrying
through
the
woods
or
past

churchyard
at
midnight
the
man
lost
in
the
woods

girl
who
tremulously
has
made
an
evening
appointment
with
her
swain
all
are
subject
to
illusions
of
sight
and
sound
which
make
their
hearts
beat
till
they
are
dispelled
twenty
times
a
day
the
lover
perambulating
the
streets
with
his
preoccupied
fancy
will
think
he
perceives
his
idol
bonnet
before
him
i
remember
one
night
in
boston
whilst
waiting
for
a
auburn
car
to
bring
me
to
cambridge
reading
most
distinctly
that
name
upon
the
signboard
of
a
car
on
which
as
i
afterwards
learned
avenue
was
painted
the
illusion
was
so
vivid
that
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
had
deceived
me
all
reading
is
more
or
less
performed
in
this
way
practised
could
not
possibly
get
on
so
fast
if
they
had
to
see
accurately
every
single
letter
of
every
word
in
order
to
perceive
the
words
more
than
half
of
the
words
come
out
of
their
mind
and
hardly
half
from
the
printed
page
were
this
not
so
did
we
perceive
each
letter
by
itself
typographic
errors
in
words
would
never
be
overlooked
children
whose
ideas
are
not
yet
ready
enough
to
perceive
words
at
a
glance
read
them
wrong
if
they
are
printed
wrong
that
is
right
according
to
the
way
of
printing
in
a
foreign
language
although
it
may
be
printed
with
the
same
letters
we
read
by
so
much
the
more
slowly
as
we
do
not
understand
or
are
unable
promptly
to
perceive
the
words
but
we
notice
misprints
all
the
more
readily
for
this
reason
latin
and
greek
and
still
better
hebrew
works
are
more
correctly
printed
because
the
proofs
are
better
corrected
than
in
german
works
of
two
friends
of
mine
one
knew
much
hebrew
the
other
little
the
latter
however
gave
instruction
in
hebrew
in
a
gymnasium
and
when
he
called
the
other
to
help
correct
his
exercises
it
turned
out
that
he
could
find
out
all
sorts
of
little
errors
better
than
his
friend
because
the
latter
perception
of
the
words
as
totals
was
too
swift
to
personal
identity
is
proverbially
for
similar
reasons
a
man
has
witnessed
a
rapid
crime
or
accident
and
carries
away
his
mental
image
later
he
is
confronted
by
a
prisoner
whom
he
forthwith
perceives
in
the
light
of
that
image
and
recognizes
or
as
the
criminal
although
he
may
never
have
been
near
the
spot
similarly
at
the
sÃ©ances
which
fraudulent
mediums
give
in
a
dark
room
a
man
sees
a
figure
who
in
a
whisper
tells
him
she
is
the
spirit
of
his
sister
mother
wife
or
child
and
falls
upon
his
neck
the
darkness
the
previous
forms
and
the
expectancy
have
so
filled
his
mind
with
premonitory
images
that
it
is
no
wonder
he
perceives
what
is
suggested
these
fraudulent
would
furnish
most
precious
documents
to
the
psychology
of
perception
if
they
could
only
be
satisfactorily
inquired
into
in
the
hypnotic
trance
any
suggested
object
is
sensibly
perceived
in
certain
subjects
this
happens
more
or
less
completely
after
waking
from
the
trance
it
would
seem
that
under
favorable
conditions
a
somewhat
similar
susceptibility
to
suggestion
may
exist
in
certain
persons
who
are
not
otherwise
entranced
at
all
this
suggestibility
obtains
in
all
the
senses
although
high
authorities
have
doubted
this
power
of
imagination
to
falsify
present
impressions
of
sense
everyone
must
be
able
to
give
instances
from
the
when
we
have
paid
the
faithless
plumber
for
pretending
to
mend
our
drains
the
intellect
inhibits
the
nose
from
perceiving
the
same
unaltered
odor
until
perhaps
several
days
go
by
as
regards
the
ventilation
or
heating
of
rooms
we
are
apt
to
feel
for
some
time
as
we
think
we
ought
to
feel
if
we
believe
the
ventilator
is
shut
we
feel
the
room
close
on
discovering
it
open
the
oppression
disappears
it
is
the
same
with
touch
everyone
must
have
felt
the
sensible
quality
change
under
his
hand
as
sudden
contact
with
something
moist
or
hairy
in
the
dark
awoke
a
shock
of
disgust
or
fear
which
faded
into
calm
recognition
of
some
familiar
object
even
so
small
a
thing
as
a
crumb
of
potato
on
the
which
we
pick
up
thinking
it
a
crumb
of
bread
feels
horrible
for
a
few
moments
to
our
fancy
and
different
from
what
it
is
in
the
sense
of
hearing
similar
mistakes
abound
everyone
must
recall
some
experience
in
which
sounds
have
altered
their
character
as
soon
as
the
intellect
referred
them
to
a
different
source
the
other
day
a
friend
was
sitting
in
my
room
when
the
clock
which
has
a
rich
low
chime
began
to
strike
hollo
said
he
hear
that
in
the
garden
and
was
surprised
at
finding
the
real
source
of
the
sound
i
have
had
myself
a
striking
illusion
of
the
sort
sitting
reading
late
one
night
i
suddenly
heard
a
most
formidable
noise
proceeding
from
the
upper
part
of
the
house
which
it
seemed
to
fill
it
ceased
and
in
a
moment
renewed
itself
i
went
into
the
hall
to
listen
but
it
came
no
more
resuming
my
seat
in
the
room
however
there
it
was
again
low
mighty
alarming
like
a
rising
flood
or
the
of
an
awful
gale
it
came
from
all
space
quite
startled
i
again
went
into
the
hall
but
it
had
already
ceased
once
more
on
returning
a
second
time
to
the
room
i
discovered
that
it
was
nothing
but
the
breathing
of
a
little
scotch
terrier
which
lay
asleep
on
the
floor
the
noteworthy
thing
is
that
as
soon
as
i
recognized
what
it
was
i
was
compelled
to
think
it
a
different
sound
and
could
not
then
hear
it
as
i
had
heard
it
a
moment
before
the
sense
of
sight
is
pregnant
with
illusions
of
both
the
types
considered
no
sense
gives
such
fluctuating
impressions
of
the
same
object
as
sight
does
with
no
sense
are
we
so
apt
to
treat
the
sensations
immediately
given
as
mere
signs
with
none
is
the
invocation
from
memory
of
a
and
the
consequent
perception
of
the
latter
so
immediate
the
which
we
perceive
always
resembles
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
the
object
of
some
absent
sensation
usually
another
optical
figure
which
in
our
mind
has
come
to
be
a
standard
bit
of
reality
and
it
is
this
incessant
reduction
of
our
immediately
given
optical
objects
to
more
standard
and
forms
which
has
led
some
authors
into
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
our
optical
sensations
are
originally
and
natively
of
no
particular
form
at
all
of
accidental
and
occasional
illusions
of
sight
many
amusing
examples
might
be
given
two
will
suffice
one
is
a
reminiscence
of
my
own
i
was
lying
in
my
berth
in
a
steamer
listening
to
the
sailors
their
devotions
with
the
holystones
outside
when
on
turning
my
eyes
to
the
window
i
perceived
with
perfect
distinctness
that
the
of
the
vessel
had
entered
my
and
was
standing
looking
through
the
window
at
the
men
at
work
upon
the
guards
surprised
at
his
intrusion
and
also
at
his
intentness
and
immobility
i
remained
watching
him
and
wondering
how
long
he
would
stand
thus
at
last
i
spoke
but
getting
no
reply
sat
up
in
my
berth
and
then
saw
that
what
i
had
taken
for
the
engineer
was
my
own
cap
and
coat
hanging
on
a
peg
beside
the
window
the
illusion
was
complete
the
engineer
was
a
man
and
i
saw
him
unmistakably
but
after
the
illusion
had
vanished
i
found
it
hard
voluntarily
to
make
the
cap
and
coat
look
like
him
at
all
in
germany
since
herbart
time
psychology
has
always
had
a
great
deal
to
say
about
a
process
called
the
incoming
ideas
or
sensations
are
said
to
be
by
of
ideas
already
in
the
mind
it
is
plain
that
the
process
we
have
been
describing
as
perception
is
at
this
rate
an
apperceptive
process
so
are
all
recognition
classing
and
naming
and
passing
beyond
these
simplest
suggestions
all
farther
thoughts
about
our
percepts
are
apperceptive
processes
as
well
i
have
myself
not
used
the
word
apperception
because
it
has
carried
very
different
meanings
in
the
history
of
philosophy
and
reaction
or
simply
are
perfect
synonyms
for
its
herbartian
meaning
widely
taken
it
is
moreover
hardly
worth
while
to
pretend
to
analyze
the
apperceptive
performances
beyond
the
first
or
perceptive
stage
because
their
variations
and
degrees
are
literally
innumerable
is
a
name
for
the
sum
total
of
the
effects
of
what
we
have
studied
as
association
and
it
is
obvious
that
the
things
which
a
given
experience
will
suggest
to
a
man
depend
on
what
lewes
calls
his
entire
psychostatical
conditions
his
nature
and
stock
of
ideas
or
in
other
words
his
character
habits
memory
education
previous
experience
and
momentary
mood
we
gain
no
insight
into
what
really
occurs
either
in
the
mind
or
in
the
brain
by
calling
all
these
things
the
mass
though
of
course
this
may
upon
occasion
be
convenient
on
the
whole
i
am
inclined
to
think
lewes
term
of
the
most
fruitful
one
yet
used
the
mass
is
treated
by
the
germans
as
the
active
factor
the
apperceived
sensation
as
the
passive
one
the
sensation
being
usually
modified
by
the
ideas
in
the
mind
out
of
the
interaction
of
the
two
cognition
is
produced
but
as
steinthal
remarks
the
apperceiving
mass
is
itself
often
modified
by
the
sensation
to
quote
him
although
the
moment
commonly
shows
itself
to
be
the
more
powerful
can
perfectly
well
occur
in
which
the
new
observation
transforms
or
enriches
the
apperceiving
group
of
ideas
a
child
who
hitherto
has
seen
none
but
tables
apperceives
a
round
one
as
a
table
but
by
this
the
apperceiving
mass
is
enriched
to
his
previous
knowledge
of
tables
comes
this
new
feature
that
they
need
not
be
but
may
be
round
in
the
history
of
science
it
has
happened
often
enough
that
some
discovery
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
apperceived
brought
into
connection
with
the
system
of
our
knowledge
transformed
the
whole
system
in
principle
however
we
must
maintain
that
although
either
factor
is
both
active
and
passive
the
factor
is
almost
always
the
more
active
of
the
two
and
this
account
of
steinthal
brings
out
very
clearly
the
between
our
psychological
conceptions
and
what
are
called
concepts
in
in
logic
a
concept
is
unalterable
but
what
are
popularly
called
our
of
things
alter
by
being
used
the
aim
of
is
to
attain
conceptions
so
adequate
and
exact
that
we
shall
never
need
to
change
them
there
is
an
everlasting
struggle
in
every
mind
between
the
tendency
to
keep
unchanged
and
the
tendency
to
renovate
its
ideas
our
education
is
a
ceaseless
compromise
between
the
conservative
and
the
progressive
factors
every
new
experience
must
be
disposed
of
under
old
head
the
great
point
is
to
find
the
head
which
has
to
be
least
altered
to
take
it
in
certain
polynesian
natives
seeing
horses
for
the
first
time
called
them
pigs
that
being
the
nearest
head
my
child
of
two
played
for
a
week
with
the
first
orange
that
was
given
him
calling
it
a
he
called
the
first
whole
eggs
he
saw
having
been
accustomed
to
see
his
broken
into
a
glass
and
his
potatoes
without
the
skin
a
folding
he
unhesitatingly
called
hardly
any
one
of
us
can
make
new
heads
easily
when
fresh
experiences
come
most
of
us
grow
more
and
more
enslaved
to
the
stock
conceptions
with
which
we
have
once
become
familiar
and
less
and
less
capable
of
assimilating
impressions
in
any
but
the
old
ways
in
short
is
the
inevitable
terminus
to
which
life
sweeps
us
on
objects
which
violate
our
established
habits
of
are
simply
not
taken
account
of
at
all
or
if
on
some
occasion
we
are
forced
by
dint
of
argument
to
admit
their
existence
hours
later
the
admission
is
as
if
it
were
not
and
every
trace
of
the
unassimilable
truth
has
vanished
from
our
thought
genius
in
truth
means
little
more
than
the
faculty
of
perceiving
in
an
unhabitual
way
on
the
other
hand
nothing
is
more
congenial
from
babyhood
to
the
end
of
life
than
to
be
able
to
assimilate
the
new
to
the
old
to
meet
each
threatening
violator
or
burster
of
our
series
of
concepts
as
it
comes
in
see
through
its
unwontedness
and
ticket
it
off
as
an
old
friend
in
disguise
this
victorious
assimilation
of
the
new
is
in
fact
the
type
of
all
intellectual
pleasure
the
lust
for
it
is
scientific
curiosity
the
relation
of
the
new
to
the
old
before
the
assimilation
is
performed
is
wonder
we
feel
neither
curiosity
nor
wonder
concerning
things
so
far
beyond
us
that
we
have
no
concepts
to
refer
them
to
or
standards
by
which
to
measure
them
the
fuegians
in
voyage
wondered
at
the
small
boats
but
took
the
big
ship
as
a
of
course
only
what
we
partly
know
already
inspires
us
with
a
desire
to
know
more
the
more
elaborate
textile
fabrics
the
vaster
works
in
metal
to
most
of
us
are
like
the
air
the
water
and
the
ground
absolute
existences
which
awaken
no
ideas
it
is
a
matter
of
course
that
an
engraving
or
a
inscription
should
possess
that
degree
of
beauty
but
if
we
are
shown
a
of
equal
perfection
our
personal
sympathy
with
the
difficulty
of
the
task
makes
us
immediately
wonder
at
the
skill
the
old
lady
admiring
the
academician
picture
says
to
him
and
is
it
really
all
done
physiological
process
in
enough
has
now
been
said
to
prove
the
general
law
of
perception
which
is
this
that
part
of
what
we
perceive
comes
through
our
senses
from
the
object
before
us
another
and
it
may
be
the
larger
part
comes
out
of
our
own
at
bottom
this
is
but
a
case
of
the
general
fact
that
our
are
organs
for
reacting
on
and
that
our
hemispheres
in
particular
are
given
us
that
records
of
our
past
private
experience
may
coÃ¶perate
in
the
reaction
of
course
such
a
general
statement
is
vague
if
we
try
to
put
an
exact
meaning
into
it
what
we
find
most
natural
to
believe
is
that
the
by
paths
which
the
previous
experiences
have
worn
which
make
us
perceive
the
probable
the
thing
by
which
on
the
previous
occasions
the
reaction
was
most
frequently
aroused
the
reaction
of
the
hemispheres
consists
in
the
lighting
up
of
a
certain
system
of
paths
by
the
current
entering
from
the
outer
world
what
corresponds
to
this
mentally
is
a
certain
special
pulse
of
thought
the
thought
namely
of
that
most
probable
object
farther
than
this
in
the
analysis
we
can
hardly
go
between
normal
perception
and
illusion
we
have
seen
that
there
is
no
break
the
being
identically
the
same
in
both
the
last
illusions
we
considered
might
fairly
be
called
hallucinations
we
must
now
consider
the
false
perceptions
more
commonly
called
by
that
name
in
ordinary
parlance
hallucination
is
held
to
differ
from
illusion
in
that
whilst
there
is
an
object
really
there
in
illusion
hallucination
there
is
no
objective
stimulus
at
we
shall
presently
see
that
this
supposed
absence
of
objective
stimulus
in
hallucination
is
a
mistake
and
that
hallucinations
are
often
only
of
the
perceptive
process
in
which
the
secondary
cerebral
reaction
is
out
of
all
normal
proportion
to
the
peripheral
stimulus
which
occasions
the
activity
hallucinations
usually
appear
abruptly
and
have
the
character
of
being
forced
upon
the
subject
but
they
possess
various
degrees
of
apparent
one
mistake
must
be
guarded
against
they
are
often
talked
of
as
projected
outwards
by
mistake
but
where
an
hallucination
is
complete
it
is
much
more
than
a
mental
image
hallucination
subjectively
considered
is
a
sensation
as
good
and
true
a
sensation
as
if
there
were
a
real
object
the
object
happens
not
to
be
there
that
is
all
the
milder
degrees
of
hallucination
have
been
designated
as
and
hallucinations
have
been
sharply
distinguished
from
each
other
only
within
a
few
years
from
ordinary
images
of
memory
and
fancy
differ
in
being
much
more
vivid
minute
detailed
steady
abrupt
and
spontaneous
in
the
sense
that
all
feeling
of
our
own
activity
in
producing
them
is
lacking
kandinsky
had
a
patient
who
after
taking
opium
or
haschisch
had
abundant
and
hallucinations
as
he
also
had
strong
visualizing
power
and
was
an
educated
physician
the
three
sorts
of
phenomena
could
be
easily
compared
although
projected
outwards
usually
not
farther
than
the
limit
of
distinctest
vision
a
foot
or
so
the
the
character
of
objective
which
the
hallucinations
possessed
but
unlike
the
pictures
of
imagination
it
was
almost
impossible
to
produce
them
at
will
most
of
the
which
people
hear
whether
they
give
rise
to
delusions
or
not
are
they
are
described
as
voices
although
their
character
is
entirely
unlike
the
inner
speech
of
the
subject
with
himself
i
know
several
persons
who
hear
such
inner
voices
making
unforeseen
remarks
whenever
they
grow
quiet
and
listen
for
them
they
are
a
very
common
incident
of
delusional
insanity
and
may
at
last
grow
into
vivid
or
completely
exteriorized
hallucinations
the
latter
are
comparatively
frequent
occurrences
in
sporadic
form
and
certain
individuals
are
liable
to
have
them
often
from
the
results
of
the
of
hallucinations
which
was
begun
by
edmund
gurney
it
would
appear
that
roughly
speaking
one
person
at
least
in
every
ten
is
likely
to
have
had
a
vivid
hallucination
at
some
time
in
his
life
the
following
case
from
a
healthy
person
will
give
an
idea
of
what
these
hallucinations
are
when
a
girl
of
eighteen
i
was
one
evening
engaged
in
a
very
painful
discussion
with
an
elderly
person
my
distress
was
so
great
that
i
took
up
a
thick
ivory
that
was
lying
on
the
mantelpiece
of
the
parlor
and
broke
it
into
small
pieces
as
i
talked
in
the
midst
of
the
discussion
i
was
very
wishful
to
know
the
opinion
of
a
brother
with
whom
i
had
an
unusually
close
relationship
i
turned
round
and
saw
him
sitting
at
the
farther
side
of
a
with
his
arms
folded
an
unusual
position
with
him
but
to
my
dismay
i
perceived
from
the
sarcastic
expression
of
his
mouth
that
he
was
not
in
sympathy
with
me
was
not
my
side
as
i
should
then
have
expressed
it
the
surprise
cooled
me
and
the
discussion
was
dropped
some
minutes
after
having
occasion
to
speak
to
my
brother
i
turned
towards
him
but
he
was
gone
i
inquired
when
he
left
the
room
and
was
told
that
he
had
not
been
in
it
which
i
did
not
believe
thinking
that
he
had
come
in
for
a
minute
and
had
gone
out
without
being
noticed
about
an
hour
and
a
half
afterwards
he
appeared
and
convinced
me
with
some
trouble
that
he
had
never
been
near
the
house
that
evening
he
is
still
alive
and
well
the
hallucinations
of
are
a
mixture
of
true
hallucination
and
illusion
those
of
opium
haschish
and
belladonna
resemble
them
in
this
respect
the
commonest
hallucination
of
all
is
that
of
hearing
one
own
name
called
aloud
nearly
one
half
of
the
sporadic
cases
which
i
have
collected
are
of
this
sort
and
hallucinations
are
easily
produced
by
verbal
suggestion
in
hypnotic
subjects
thus
point
to
a
dot
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
call
it
grant
photograph
and
your
subject
will
see
a
photograph
of
the
general
there
instead
of
the
dot
the
dot
gives
objectivity
to
the
appearance
and
the
suggested
notion
of
the
general
gives
it
form
then
magnify
the
dot
by
a
lens
double
it
by
a
prism
or
by
nudging
the
eyeball
reflect
it
in
a
mirror
turn
it
or
wipe
it
out
and
the
subject
will
tell
you
that
the
has
been
enlarged
doubled
reflected
turned
about
or
made
to
disappear
in
binet
language
the
dot
is
the
outward
de
which
is
needed
to
give
objectivity
to
your
suggestion
and
without
which
the
latter
will
only
produce
an
inner
image
in
the
subject
mind
binet
has
shown
that
such
a
peripheral
de
is
used
in
an
enormous
number
not
only
of
hypnotic
hallucinations
but
of
hallucinations
of
the
insane
these
latter
are
often
that
is
the
patient
hears
the
voices
always
on
one
side
of
him
or
sees
the
figure
only
when
a
certain
one
of
his
eyes
is
open
in
many
of
these
cases
it
has
been
distinctly
proved
that
a
morbid
irritation
in
the
internal
ear
or
an
opacity
in
the
humors
of
the
eye
was
the
starting
point
of
the
current
which
the
patient
diseased
acoustic
or
optical
centres
clothed
with
their
peculiar
products
in
the
way
of
ideas
produced
in
this
way
are
and
binet
theory
that
all
hallucinations
must
start
in
the
periphery
may
be
called
an
attempt
to
reduce
hallucination
and
illusion
to
one
physiological
the
type
namely
to
which
normal
perception
belongs
in
every
case
according
to
binet
whether
of
perception
of
hallucination
or
of
illusion
we
get
the
sensational
vividness
by
means
of
a
current
from
the
peripheral
nerves
it
may
be
a
mere
trace
of
a
current
but
that
trace
is
enough
to
kindle
the
maximal
process
of
disintegration
in
the
cells
cf
and
to
give
to
the
object
perceived
the
character
of
what
the
of
the
object
shall
be
will
depend
wholly
on
the
particular
system
of
paths
in
which
the
process
is
kindled
part
of
the
thing
in
all
cases
comes
from
the
the
rest
is
furnished
by
the
mind
but
we
can
not
by
introspection
distinguish
between
these
parts
and
our
only
formula
for
the
result
is
that
the
brain
has
the
impression
in
the
resulting
way
binet
theory
accounts
indeed
for
a
multitude
of
cases
but
certainly
not
for
all
the
prism
does
not
always
double
the
false
appearance
nor
does
the
latter
always
disappear
when
the
eyes
are
closed
for
binet
an
abnormally
or
exclusively
active
part
of
the
cortex
gives
the
of
what
shall
appear
whilst
a
peripheral
alone
can
give
the
sufficient
to
make
it
appear
projected
into
real
space
but
since
this
intensity
is
after
all
but
a
matter
of
degree
one
does
not
see
why
under
rare
conditions
the
degree
in
question
not
be
attained
by
inner
causes
exclusively
in
that
case
we
should
have
certain
hallucinations
centrally
initiated
as
well
as
the
peripherally
initiated
hallucinations
which
are
the
only
sort
that
binet
theory
allows
seems
probable
on
the
whole
therefore
that
centrally
initiated
hallucinations
can
how
often
they
do
exist
is
another
question
the
existence
of
hallucinations
which
affect
more
than
one
sense
is
an
argument
for
central
initiation
for
grant
that
the
thing
seen
may
have
its
starting
point
in
the
outer
world
the
voice
which
it
is
heard
to
utter
must
be
due
to
an
influence
from
the
visual
region
must
be
of
central
origin
sporadic
cases
of
hallucination
visiting
people
only
once
in
a
lifetime
which
seem
to
be
a
quite
frequent
type
are
on
any
theory
hard
to
understand
in
detail
they
are
often
extraordinarily
complete
and
the
fact
that
many
of
them
are
reported
as
that
is
as
coinciding
with
real
events
such
as
accidents
deaths
of
the
persons
seen
is
an
additional
complication
of
the
phenomenon
the
first
really
scientific
study
of
hallucination
in
all
its
possible
bearings
on
the
basis
of
a
large
mass
of
empirical
material
was
begun
by
edmund
gurney
and
is
continued
by
other
members
of
the
society
for
psychical
research
and
the
is
now
being
applied
to
several
countries
under
the
auspices
of
the
international
congress
of
experimental
psychology
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
out
of
these
combined
labors
something
solid
will
eventually
grow
the
facts
shade
off
into
the
phenomena
of
motor
automatism
trance
etc
and
nothing
but
a
wide
comparative
study
can
give
really
instructive
results
chapter
xxi
the
perception
of
space
as
adult
thinkers
we
have
a
definite
and
apparently
instantaneous
knowledge
of
the
sizes
shapes
and
distances
of
the
things
amongst
which
we
live
and
move
and
we
have
moreover
a
practically
definite
notion
of
the
whole
great
infinite
continuum
of
real
space
in
which
the
world
swings
and
in
which
all
these
things
are
located
nevertheless
it
seems
obvious
that
the
baby
world
is
vague
and
confused
in
all
these
respects
how
does
our
definite
knowledge
of
space
grow
up
this
is
one
of
the
quarrelsome
problems
in
psychology
this
chapter
must
be
so
brief
that
there
will
be
no
room
for
the
polemic
and
historic
aspects
of
the
subject
and
i
will
state
simply
and
dogmatically
the
conclusions
which
seem
most
plausible
to
me
quality
of
exists
in
all
sensations
just
as
intensity
does
we
call
the
reverberations
of
a
more
voluminous
than
the
squeaking
of
a
the
entrance
into
a
warm
bath
gives
our
skin
a
more
massive
feeling
than
the
prick
of
a
pin
a
little
neuralgic
pain
fine
as
a
cobweb
in
the
face
seems
less
extensive
than
the
heavy
soreness
of
a
boil
or
the
vast
discomfort
of
a
colic
or
a
lumbago
and
a
solitary
star
looks
smaller
than
the
noonday
sky
muscular
sensations
and
sensations
have
volume
smells
and
tastes
are
not
without
it
and
sensations
from
our
inward
organs
have
it
in
a
marked
degree
repletion
and
emptiness
suffocation
palpitation
headache
are
examples
of
this
and
certainly
not
less
spatial
is
the
consciousness
we
have
of
our
general
bodily
condition
in
nausea
fever
heavy
drowsiness
and
fatigue
our
entire
cubic
content
seems
then
sensibly
manifest
to
us
as
such
and
feels
much
larger
than
any
local
pulsation
pressure
or
discomfort
skin
and
retina
are
however
the
organs
in
which
the
plays
the
most
active
part
not
only
does
the
maximal
vastness
yielded
by
the
retina
surpass
that
yielded
by
any
other
organ
but
the
intricacy
with
which
our
attention
can
subdivide
this
vastness
and
perceive
it
to
be
composed
of
lesser
portions
simultaneously
coexisting
alongside
of
each
other
is
without
a
parallel
elsewhere
the
ear
gives
a
greater
vastness
than
the
skin
but
is
considerably
less
able
to
subdivide
it
the
moreover
is
as
great
in
one
direction
as
in
its
dimensions
are
so
vague
that
in
it
there
is
no
question
as
yet
of
surface
as
opposed
to
depth
being
the
best
short
name
for
the
sensation
in
question
of
different
orders
are
roughly
comparable
with
each
other
as
to
their
persons
born
blind
are
said
to
be
surprised
at
the
largeness
with
which
objects
appear
to
them
when
their
sight
is
restored
franz
says
of
his
patient
cured
of
cataract
he
saw
everything
much
larger
than
he
had
supposed
from
the
idea
obtained
by
his
sense
of
touch
moving
and
especially
living
objects
appeared
very
large
loud
sounds
have
a
certain
enormousness
of
feeling
bodies
as
hering
says
give
us
a
perception
which
seems
in
comparison
with
that
of
strictly
a
glowing
iron
looks
luminous
through
and
through
and
so
does
a
flame
the
interior
of
one
feels
larger
when
explored
by
the
tongue
than
when
looked
at
the
crater
of
a
tooth
and
the
movements
of
a
loose
tooth
in
its
socket
feel
quite
monstrous
a
midge
buzzing
against
the
drum
of
the
ear
will
often
seem
as
big
as
a
butterfly
the
pressure
of
the
air
in
the
tympanic
cavity
upon
the
membrane
gives
an
astonishingly
large
sensation
voluminousness
of
the
feeling
seems
to
bear
very
little
relation
to
the
size
of
the
organ
that
yields
the
ear
and
eye
are
comparatively
minute
organs
yet
they
give
us
feelings
of
great
volume
the
same
lack
of
exact
proportion
between
size
of
feeling
and
size
of
organ
affected
obtains
within
the
limits
of
particular
sensory
organs
an
object
appears
smaller
on
the
lateral
portions
of
the
retina
than
it
does
on
the
fovea
as
may
be
easily
verified
by
holding
the
two
forefingers
parallel
and
a
couple
of
inches
apart
and
transferring
the
gaze
of
one
eye
from
one
to
the
other
then
the
finger
not
directly
looked
at
will
appear
to
shrink
on
the
skin
if
two
points
kept
equidistant
blunted
for
example
be
drawn
along
so
as
really
to
describe
a
pair
of
parallel
lines
the
lines
will
appear
farther
apart
in
some
spots
than
in
others
if
for
example
we
draw
them
across
the
face
the
person
experimented
upon
will
feel
as
if
they
began
to
diverge
near
the
mouth
and
to
include
it
in
a
ellipse
illustration
fig
after
weber
the
dotted
lines
give
the
real
course
of
the
points
the
continuous
lines
the
course
as
felt
now
my
first
thesis
is
that
this
extensity
in
each
and
every
sensation
though
more
developed
in
some
than
in
is
the
original
sensation
of
space
out
of
which
all
the
exact
knowledge
about
space
that
we
afterwards
come
to
have
is
woven
by
processes
of
discrimination
association
and
selection
construction
of
real
to
the
babe
who
first
opens
his
senses
upon
the
world
though
the
experience
is
one
of
vastness
or
extensity
it
is
of
an
extensity
within
which
no
definite
divisions
directions
sizes
or
distances
are
yet
marked
out
potentially
the
room
in
which
the
child
is
born
is
subdivisible
into
a
multitude
of
parts
fixed
or
movable
which
at
any
given
moment
of
time
have
definite
relations
to
each
other
and
to
his
person
potentially
too
this
room
taken
as
a
whole
can
be
prolonged
in
various
directions
by
the
addition
to
it
of
those
spaces
which
constitute
the
outer
world
but
actually
the
further
spaces
are
unfelt
and
the
subdivisions
are
undiscriminated
by
the
babe
the
chief
part
of
whose
education
during
his
first
year
of
life
consists
in
his
becoming
acquainted
with
them
and
recognizing
and
identifying
them
in
detail
this
process
may
be
called
that
of
the
of
real
as
a
newly
apprehended
object
out
of
the
original
chaotic
experiences
of
vastness
it
consists
of
several
subordinate
processes
first
the
total
object
of
vision
or
of
feeling
at
any
time
have
smaller
objects
definitely
discriminated
within
secondly
seen
or
tasted
must
be
identified
with
objects
felt
and
so
that
same
may
come
to
be
recognized
although
apprehended
in
such
widely
differing
ways
third
the
total
extent
felt
at
any
time
must
be
conceived
as
located
in
the
midst
of
the
surrounding
extents
of
which
the
world
fourth
these
objects
appear
arranged
in
definite
in
the
three
dimensions
and
fifth
their
relative
sizes
must
be
perceived
in
other
words
must
be
let
us
take
these
processes
in
regular
order
or
concerning
this
there
is
not
much
to
be
added
to
what
was
set
forth
in
chapter
xiv
moving
parts
sharp
parts
brightly
colored
parts
of
the
total
field
of
perception
the
attention
and
are
then
discerned
as
special
objects
surrounded
by
the
remainder
of
the
field
of
view
or
touch
that
when
such
objects
are
discerned
apart
they
should
appear
as
thus
surrounded
must
be
set
down
as
an
ultimate
fact
of
our
sensibility
of
which
no
farther
account
can
be
given
later
as
one
partial
object
of
this
sort
after
another
has
become
familiar
and
identifiable
the
attention
can
be
caught
by
more
than
one
at
once
we
then
see
or
feel
a
number
of
distinct
objects
alongside
of
each
other
in
the
general
extended
field
the
is
in
the
first
instance
vague
it
may
not
carry
with
it
the
sense
of
definite
directions
or
distances
and
it
too
must
be
regarded
as
an
ultimate
fact
of
our
sensibility
of
different
sensations
into
the
same
when
two
senses
are
impressed
simultaneously
we
tend
to
identify
their
objects
as
when
a
conductor
is
brought
near
the
skin
the
snap
heard
the
spark
seen
and
the
sting
felt
are
all
located
together
and
believed
to
be
different
aspects
of
one
entity
the
discharge
the
space
of
the
seen
object
fuses
with
the
space
of
the
heard
object
and
with
that
of
the
felt
object
by
an
ultimate
law
of
our
consciousness
which
is
that
we
simplify
unify
and
identify
as
much
as
we
possibly
can
sensible
data
can
be
attended
to
together
we
locate
together
their
several
extents
seem
one
extent
the
place
at
which
each
clears
is
held
to
be
the
same
with
the
place
at
which
the
others
this
is
the
first
and
great
by
which
our
world
gets
spatially
arranged
in
this
in
a
one
of
the
coalescing
sensations
is
held
to
the
thing
the
other
sensations
are
taken
for
its
more
or
less
accidental
or
modes
of
appearance
the
sensation
chosen
to
be
essentially
the
thing
is
the
most
constant
and
practically
important
of
the
lot
most
often
it
is
hardness
or
weight
but
the
hardness
or
weight
is
never
without
tactile
bulk
and
as
we
can
always
see
something
in
our
hand
when
we
feel
something
there
we
equate
the
bulk
felt
with
the
bulk
seen
and
thenceforward
this
common
bulk
is
also
apt
to
figure
as
of
the
essence
of
the
frequently
a
shape
so
figures
sometimes
a
temperature
a
taste
etc
but
for
the
most
part
temperature
smell
sound
color
or
whatever
other
phenomena
may
vividly
impress
us
simultaneously
with
the
bulk
felt
or
seen
figure
among
the
accidents
smell
and
sound
impress
us
it
is
true
when
we
neither
see
nor
touch
the
thing
but
they
are
strongest
when
we
see
or
touch
so
we
locate
the
of
these
properties
within
the
touched
or
seen
space
whilst
the
properties
themselves
we
regard
as
overflowing
in
a
weakened
form
into
the
spaces
filled
by
other
things
all
this
it
will
be
observed
the
whose
spaces
coalesce
into
one
are
yielded
by
different
such
data
have
no
tendency
to
displace
each
other
from
consciousness
but
can
be
attended
to
together
all
at
once
often
indeed
they
vary
concomitantly
and
reach
a
maximum
together
we
may
be
sure
therefore
that
the
general
rule
of
our
mind
is
to
locate
in
all
sensations
which
are
associated
in
simultaneous
experience
and
do
not
interfere
with
each
perception
sense
of
the
surrounding
impressions
on
the
same
do
interfere
with
each
other
perception
and
can
not
well
be
attended
to
at
once
hence
do
not
locate
them
in
each
other
spaces
but
arrange
them
in
a
serial
order
of
exteriority
each
alongside
of
the
rest
in
a
space
larger
than
that
which
any
one
sensation
we
can
usually
recover
anything
lost
from
our
sight
by
moving
our
eyes
back
in
its
direction
and
it
is
through
these
constant
changes
that
every
field
of
seen
things
comes
at
last
to
be
thought
of
as
always
having
a
fringe
of
things
possible
to
be
spreading
in
all
directions
round
about
it
meanwhile
the
movements
concomitantly
with
which
the
various
fields
alternate
are
also
felt
and
remembered
and
gradually
through
association
this
and
that
movement
come
in
our
thought
to
suggest
this
or
that
extent
of
fresh
objects
introduced
gradually
too
since
the
objects
vary
indefinitely
in
kind
we
abstract
from
their
several
natures
and
think
separately
of
their
mere
extents
of
which
extents
the
various
movements
remain
as
the
only
constant
introducers
and
associates
more
and
more
therefore
do
we
think
of
movement
and
seen
extent
as
mutually
involving
each
other
until
at
last
we
may
get
to
regard
them
as
synonymous
and
empty
space
then
meaning
for
us
mere
for
we
may
if
we
are
psychologists
readily
but
erroneously
assign
to
the
the
chief
rÃ´le
in
perceiving
extensiveness
at
all
serial
order
of
the
muscular
sense
much
to
do
with
defining
the
of
of
things
seen
felt
or
heard
we
look
at
a
point
another
point
upon
the
retina
margin
catches
our
attention
and
in
an
instant
we
turn
the
fovea
upon
it
letting
its
image
successively
fall
upon
all
the
points
of
the
intervening
retinal
line
the
line
thus
traced
so
rapidly
by
the
second
point
is
itself
a
visual
object
with
the
first
and
second
point
at
its
respective
ends
it
the
points
which
become
by
its
with
reference
to
each
other
if
a
third
point
catch
the
attention
more
peripheral
still
than
the
second
point
then
a
still
greater
movement
of
the
eyeball
and
a
continuation
of
the
line
will
result
the
second
point
now
appearing
the
first
and
third
every
moment
of
our
life
objects
are
drawing
lines
like
this
between
themselves
and
other
objects
which
they
displace
from
our
attention
as
we
bring
them
to
the
centre
of
our
field
of
view
each
peripheral
retinal
point
comes
in
this
way
to
a
line
at
the
end
of
which
it
lies
a
line
which
a
possible
movement
will
trace
and
even
the
motionless
field
of
vision
ends
at
last
by
signifying
a
system
of
positions
brought
out
by
possible
movements
between
its
centre
and
all
peripheral
parts
it
is
the
same
with
our
skin
and
joints
by
moving
our
hand
over
objects
we
trace
lines
of
direction
and
new
impressions
arise
at
their
ends
the
are
sometimes
on
the
articular
surfaces
sometimes
on
the
skin
as
well
in
either
case
they
give
a
definite
order
of
arrangement
to
the
successive
objects
between
which
they
intervene
similarly
with
sounds
and
smells
with
our
heads
in
a
certain
position
a
certain
sound
or
a
certain
smell
is
most
distinct
turning
our
head
makes
this
experience
fainter
and
brings
another
sound
or
another
smell
to
its
maximum
the
two
sounds
or
smells
are
thus
separated
by
the
movement
located
at
its
ends
the
movement
itself
being
realized
as
a
sweep
through
space
whose
value
is
given
partly
by
the
feeling
partly
by
the
articular
cartilages
of
the
neck
and
partly
by
the
impressions
produced
upon
the
eye
by
such
general
principles
of
action
as
these
everything
looked
at
felt
smelt
or
heard
comes
to
be
located
in
a
more
or
less
definite
position
relatively
to
other
collateral
things
either
actually
presented
or
only
imagined
as
possibly
there
i
say
things
for
i
prefer
not
to
complicate
the
account
just
yet
with
any
special
consideration
of
the
dimension
distance
or
depth
as
it
has
been
called
measurement
of
things
in
terms
of
each
here
the
first
thing
that
seems
evident
is
that
we
have
no
power
of
comparing
together
with
any
accuracy
the
extents
revealed
by
different
sensations
our
feels
indeed
to
the
tongue
larger
than
it
feels
to
the
finger
or
eye
our
lips
feel
larger
than
a
surface
equal
to
them
on
our
thigh
so
much
comparison
is
immediate
but
it
is
vague
and
for
anything
exact
we
must
resort
to
other
help
great
agent
in
comparing
the
extent
felt
by
one
sensory
surface
with
that
felt
by
another
is
superposition
superposition
of
one
surface
upon
another
and
superposition
of
one
outer
thing
upon
many
two
surfaces
of
skin
superposed
on
each
other
are
felt
simultaneously
and
by
the
law
laid
down
on
are
judged
to
occupy
an
identical
place
similarly
of
our
hand
when
seen
and
felt
at
the
same
time
by
its
resident
sensibility
in
these
identifications
and
reductions
of
the
many
to
the
one
it
must
be
noticed
that
the
resident
sensations
of
largeness
of
two
opposed
surfaces
conflict
one
of
the
sensations
is
chosen
as
the
true
standard
and
the
other
treated
as
illusory
thus
an
empty
is
believed
to
really
smaller
than
the
which
it
will
not
admit
although
it
may
larger
and
in
general
it
may
be
said
that
the
hand
as
the
almost
exclusive
organ
of
palpation
gives
its
own
magnitude
to
the
other
parts
instead
of
having
its
size
determined
by
them
but
even
though
exploration
of
one
surface
by
another
were
impossible
could
always
measure
our
various
surfaces
against
each
other
by
applying
the
same
extended
object
first
to
one
and
then
to
we
might
of
course
at
first
suppose
that
the
object
itself
waxed
and
waned
as
it
glided
from
one
place
to
another
cf
above
fig
but
the
principle
of
simplifying
as
much
as
possible
our
world
would
soon
drive
us
out
of
that
assumption
into
the
easier
one
that
objects
as
a
rule
keep
their
sizes
and
that
most
of
our
sensations
are
affected
by
errors
for
which
a
constant
allowance
must
be
made
in
the
retina
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
bignesses
of
two
impressions
lines
or
blotches
falling
on
different
regions
are
at
first
felt
to
stand
in
any
exact
mutual
ratio
but
if
the
impressions
come
from
the
then
we
might
judge
their
sizes
to
be
just
the
same
this
however
only
when
the
relation
of
the
object
to
the
eye
is
believed
to
be
on
the
whole
unchanged
when
the
object
by
moving
changes
its
relations
to
the
eye
the
sensation
excited
by
its
image
even
on
the
same
retinal
region
becomes
so
fluctuating
that
we
end
by
ascribing
no
absolute
import
whatever
to
the
retinal
which
at
any
moment
we
may
receive
so
complete
does
this
overlooking
of
retinal
magnitude
become
that
it
is
next
to
impossible
to
compare
the
visual
magnitudes
of
objects
at
different
distances
without
making
the
experiment
of
superposition
we
can
not
say
beforehand
how
much
of
a
distant
house
or
tree
our
finger
will
cover
the
various
answers
to
the
familiar
question
how
large
is
the
moon
answers
which
vary
from
a
cartwheel
to
a
wafer
illustrate
this
most
strikingly
the
hardest
part
of
the
training
of
a
young
draughtsman
is
his
learning
to
feel
directly
the
retinal
primitively
sensible
magnitudes
which
the
different
objects
in
the
field
of
view
subtend
to
do
this
he
must
recover
what
ruskin
calls
the
of
the
eye
that
is
a
sort
of
childish
perception
of
stains
of
color
merely
as
such
without
consciousness
of
what
they
mean
with
the
rest
of
us
this
innocence
is
lost
of
all
the
visual
magnitudes
of
each
known
object
we
have
selected
one
as
the
one
to
think
of
and
degraded
all
the
others
to
serve
as
its
this
real
magnitude
is
determined
by
Ã¦sthetic
and
practical
interests
it
is
that
which
we
get
when
the
object
is
at
the
distance
most
propitious
for
exact
visual
discrimination
of
its
details
this
is
the
distance
at
which
we
hold
anything
we
are
examining
farther
than
this
we
see
it
too
small
nearer
too
large
and
the
larger
and
the
smaller
feeling
vanish
in
the
act
of
suggesting
this
one
their
more
important
as
i
look
along
the
i
overlook
the
fact
that
the
farther
plates
and
glasses
so
much
smaller
than
my
own
for
i
that
they
are
all
equal
in
size
and
the
feeling
of
them
which
is
a
present
sensation
is
eclipsed
in
the
glare
of
the
knowledge
which
is
a
merely
imagined
one
is
the
same
with
shape
as
with
almost
all
the
visible
shapes
of
things
are
what
we
call
perspective
square
constantly
present
two
acute
and
two
obtuse
angles
circles
drawn
on
our
our
carpets
or
on
sheets
of
paper
usually
show
like
ellipses
parallels
approach
as
they
recede
human
bodies
are
foreshortened
and
the
transitions
from
one
to
another
of
these
altering
forms
are
infinite
and
continual
out
of
the
flux
however
one
phase
always
stands
prominent
it
is
the
form
the
object
has
when
we
see
it
easiest
and
best
and
that
is
when
our
eyes
and
the
object
both
are
in
what
may
be
called
normal
in
this
position
our
head
is
upright
and
our
optic
axes
either
parallel
or
symmetrically
convergent
the
plane
of
the
object
is
perpendicular
to
the
visual
plane
and
if
the
object
is
one
containing
many
lines
it
is
turned
so
as
to
make
them
as
far
as
possible
either
parallel
or
perpendicular
to
the
visual
plane
in
this
situation
it
is
that
we
compare
all
shapes
with
each
other
here
every
exact
measurement
and
every
decision
is
made
sensations
are
signs
to
us
of
other
sensations
whose
is
held
to
be
more
thing
as
it
would
appear
to
the
eye
if
it
were
in
the
normal
position
is
what
we
think
whenever
we
get
one
of
the
other
optical
views
only
as
represented
in
the
normal
position
do
we
believe
we
see
the
object
as
it
elsewhere
only
as
it
seems
experience
and
custom
soon
teach
us
however
that
the
seeming
appearance
passes
into
the
real
one
by
continuous
gradations
they
teach
us
moreover
that
seeming
and
being
may
be
strangely
interchanged
now
a
real
circle
may
slide
into
a
seeming
ellipse
now
an
ellipse
may
by
sliding
in
the
same
direction
become
a
seeming
circle
now
a
rectangular
cross
grows
now
a
one
grows
rectangular
almost
any
form
in
oblique
vision
may
be
thus
a
derivative
of
almost
any
other
in
vision
and
we
must
learn
when
we
get
one
of
the
former
appearances
to
translate
it
into
the
appropriate
one
of
the
latter
class
we
must
learn
of
what
optical
it
is
one
of
the
optical
signs
having
learned
this
we
do
but
obey
that
law
of
economy
or
simplification
which
dominates
our
whole
psychic
life
when
we
think
exclusively
of
the
and
ignore
as
much
as
our
consciousness
will
let
us
the
by
which
we
came
to
apprehend
it
the
signs
of
each
probable
real
thing
being
multiple
and
the
thing
itself
one
and
fixed
we
gain
the
same
mental
relief
by
abandoning
the
former
for
the
latter
that
we
do
when
we
abandon
mental
images
with
all
their
fluctuating
characters
for
the
definite
and
unchangeable
which
they
suggest
the
selection
of
the
several
appearances
from
out
of
the
jungle
of
our
optical
experiences
to
serve
as
the
real
sights
of
which
we
shall
think
has
thus
some
analogy
to
the
habit
of
thinking
in
words
in
that
by
both
we
substitute
terms
few
and
fixed
for
terms
manifold
and
vague
if
an
optical
sensation
can
thus
be
a
mere
sign
to
recall
another
sensation
of
the
same
sense
judged
more
real
can
sensations
of
one
sense
be
signs
of
realities
which
are
objects
of
another
smells
and
tastes
make
us
believe
the
strawberry
or
cheese
to
be
there
sights
suggest
objects
of
touch
touches
suggest
objects
of
sight
etc
in
all
this
substitution
and
suggestive
recall
the
only
law
that
holds
good
is
that
in
general
the
most
of
the
sensations
which
the
can
give
us
is
held
to
represent
its
real
nature
most
truly
it
is
a
case
of
the
selective
activity
mentioned
on
ff
third
dimension
or
this
service
of
sensations
as
mere
signs
to
be
ignored
when
they
have
evoked
the
other
sensations
which
are
their
significates
was
noticed
first
by
berkeley
in
his
new
theory
of
vision
he
dwelt
particularly
on
the
fact
that
the
signs
were
not
signs
but
properties
of
the
object
merely
by
with
the
more
real
aspects
of
it
which
they
recall
the
tangible
of
a
thing
and
the
of
it
to
the
eye
have
absolutely
no
point
in
common
said
berkeley
and
if
i
think
of
the
look
of
it
when
i
get
the
feel
or
think
of
the
feel
when
i
get
the
look
that
is
merely
due
to
the
fact
that
i
have
on
so
many
previous
occasions
had
the
two
sensations
at
once
when
we
open
our
eyes
for
example
we
think
we
see
how
far
off
the
object
is
but
this
feeling
of
distance
according
to
berkeley
can
not
possibly
be
a
retinal
sensation
for
a
point
in
outer
space
can
only
impress
our
retina
by
the
single
dot
which
it
projects
the
fund
of
the
eye
and
this
dot
is
the
same
for
distances
distance
from
the
eye
berkeley
considered
not
to
be
an
optical
object
at
all
but
an
object
of
of
which
we
have
optical
signs
of
various
sorts
such
as
the
image
apparent
magnitude
its
or
and
the
of
accommodation
and
convergence
by
distance
being
an
object
of
berkeley
meant
that
our
notion
of
it
consists
in
ideas
of
the
amount
of
muscular
movement
of
arm
or
legs
which
would
be
required
to
place
our
hand
upon
the
object
most
authors
have
agreed
with
berkeley
that
creatures
unable
to
move
either
their
eyes
or
limbs
would
have
no
notion
whatever
of
distance
or
the
third
dimension
this
opinion
seems
to
me
unjustifiable
i
can
not
get
over
the
fact
that
all
our
sensations
are
of
and
that
the
primitive
field
of
view
however
imperfectly
distance
may
be
discriminated
or
measured
in
it
can
not
be
of
something
as
these
authors
unanimously
maintain
nor
can
i
get
over
the
fact
that
distance
when
i
see
it
is
a
genuinely
even
though
i
be
at
a
loss
to
assign
any
one
physiological
process
in
the
organ
of
vision
to
the
varying
degrees
of
which
the
variations
of
the
feeling
uniformly
correspond
it
is
awakened
by
all
the
optical
signs
which
berkeley
mentioned
and
by
more
besides
such
as
wheatstone
binocular
disparity
and
by
the
parallax
which
follows
on
slightly
moving
the
head
when
awakened
however
it
seems
optical
and
not
heterogeneous
with
the
other
two
dimensions
of
the
visual
field
the
mutual
equivalencies
of
the
with
the
and
dimensions
of
the
field
of
view
can
easily
be
settled
without
resorting
to
experiences
of
touch
a
being
reduced
to
a
single
eyeball
would
perceive
the
same
tridimensional
world
which
we
do
if
he
had
our
intellectual
powers
for
the
moving
by
alternately
covering
different
parts
of
his
retina
would
determine
the
mutual
equivalencies
of
the
first
two
dimensions
of
the
field
of
view
and
by
exciting
the
physiological
cause
of
his
perception
of
depth
in
various
degrees
they
would
establish
a
scale
of
equivalency
between
the
first
two
and
the
third
first
of
all
one
of
the
sensations
given
by
the
object
would
be
chosen
to
represent
its
size
and
shape
in
accordance
with
the
principles
so
lately
laid
down
one
sensation
would
measure
the
present
and
the
would
measure
the
other
sensations
the
peripheral
parts
of
the
retina
would
be
equated
with
the
central
by
receiving
the
image
of
the
same
object
this
needs
no
elucidation
in
case
the
object
does
not
change
its
distance
or
its
front
but
suppose
to
take
a
more
complicated
case
that
the
object
is
a
stick
seen
first
in
its
whole
length
and
then
rotated
round
one
of
its
ends
let
this
fixed
end
be
the
one
near
the
eye
in
this
movement
the
stick
image
will
grow
progressively
shorter
its
farther
end
will
appear
less
and
less
separated
laterally
from
its
fixed
near
end
soon
it
will
be
screened
by
the
latter
and
then
reappear
on
the
opposite
side
the
image
there
finally
resuming
its
original
length
suppose
this
movement
to
become
a
familiar
experience
the
mind
will
presumably
react
upon
it
after
its
usual
fashion
which
is
that
of
unifying
all
data
which
it
is
in
any
way
possible
to
unify
and
consider
it
the
movement
of
a
constant
object
rather
than
the
transformation
of
a
fluctuating
one
now
the
of
which
it
receives
during
the
experience
is
awakened
more
by
the
far
than
by
the
near
end
of
the
object
but
how
much
depth
what
shall
measure
its
amount
why
at
the
moment
the
far
end
is
about
to
be
eclipsed
the
difference
of
its
distance
from
the
near
end
distance
must
be
judged
equal
to
the
stick
whole
length
but
that
length
has
already
been
seen
and
measured
by
a
certain
visual
sensation
of
breadth
we
find
that
given
amounts
of
the
visual
become
signs
of
given
amounts
of
the
visual
depth
becoming
equated
with
breadth
the
measurement
of
distance
is
as
berkeley
truly
said
a
result
of
suggestion
and
experience
but
visual
experience
alone
is
adequate
to
produce
it
and
this
he
erroneously
part
played
by
the
intellect
in
but
although
berkeley
was
wrong
in
his
assertion
that
out
of
optical
experience
alone
no
perception
of
distance
can
be
evolved
he
gave
a
great
impetus
to
psychology
by
showing
how
originally
incoherent
and
incommensurable
in
respect
of
their
extensiveness
our
different
sensations
are
and
how
our
actually
so
rapid
are
almost
altogether
acquired
by
education
is
one
world
is
another
world
the
two
worlds
have
no
essential
or
intrinsic
congruence
and
only
through
the
of
ideas
do
we
know
what
a
seen
object
signifies
in
terms
of
touch
persons
with
congenital
cataracts
relieved
by
surgical
aid
whose
world
until
the
operation
has
been
a
world
of
tangibles
exclusively
are
ludicrously
unable
at
first
to
name
any
of
the
objects
which
newly
fall
upon
their
eye
it
might
very
well
be
said
the
latest
patient
of
this
sort
of
whom
we
have
an
account
when
a
bottle
was
held
up
a
foot
from
his
face
neither
do
such
patients
have
any
accurate
notion
in
motor
terms
of
the
relative
distances
of
things
from
their
eyes
all
such
confusions
very
quickly
disappear
with
practice
and
the
novel
optical
sensations
translate
themselves
into
the
familiar
language
of
touch
the
facts
do
not
prove
in
the
least
that
the
optical
sensations
are
not
but
only
that
it
needs
a
subtler
sense
for
analogy
than
most
people
have
to
discern
the
spatial
aspects
and
relations
in
them
which
tactile
and
motor
experiences
have
yielded
to
sum
up
the
whole
history
of
is
explicable
if
we
admit
on
the
one
hand
sensations
with
certain
amounts
of
extensity
native
to
them
and
on
the
other
the
ordinary
powers
of
discrimination
selection
and
association
in
the
mind
dealings
with
them
the
fluctuating
import
of
many
of
our
optical
sensations
the
same
sensation
being
so
ambiguous
as
regards
size
shape
locality
and
the
like
has
led
many
to
believe
that
such
attributes
as
these
could
not
possibly
be
the
result
of
sensation
at
all
but
must
come
from
some
higher
power
of
intuition
synthesis
or
whatever
it
might
be
called
but
the
fact
that
a
present
sensation
can
at
any
time
become
the
sign
of
a
represented
one
judged
to
be
more
real
sufficiently
accounts
for
all
the
phenomena
without
the
need
of
supposing
that
the
quality
of
extensity
is
created
out
of
experiences
by
a
faculty
of
the
mind
chapter

reasoning
reasoning
we
talk
of
man
being
the
rational
animal
and
the
traditional
intellectualist
philosophy
has
always
made
a
great
point
of
treating
the
brutes
as
wholly
irrational
creatures
nevertheless
it
is
by
no
means
easy
to
decide
just
what
is
meant
by
reason
or
how
the
peculiar
thinking
process
called
reasoning
differs
from
other
which
may
lead
to
similar
results
much
of
our
thinking
consists
of
trains
of
images
suggested
one
by
another
of
a
sort
of
spontaneous
revery
of
which
it
seems
likely
enough
that
the
higher
brutes
should
be
capable
this
sort
of
thinking
leads
nevertheless
to
rational
conclusions
both
practical
and
theoretical
the
links
between
the
terms
are
either
or
and
with
a
mixture
of
both
these
things
we
can
hardly
be
very
incoherent
as
a
rule
in
this
sort
of
irresponsible
thinking
the
terms
which
fall
to
be
coupled
together
are
empirical
concretes
not
abstractions
a
sunset
may
call
up
the
vessel
deck
from
which
i
saw
one
last
summer
the
companions
of
my
voyage
my
arrival
into
port
etc
or
it
may
make
me
think
of
solar
myths
of
hercules
and
hector
funeral
pyres
of
homer
and
whether
he
could
write
of
the
greek
alphabet
etc
if
habitual
contiguities
predominate
we
have
a
prosaic
mind
if
rare
contiguities
or
similarities
have
free
play
we
call
the
person
fanciful
poetic
or
witty
but
the
thought
as
a
rule
is
of
matters
taken
in
their
entirety
having
been
thinking
of
one
we
find
later
that
we
are
thinking
of
another
to
which
we
have
been
lifted
along
we
hardly
know
how
if
an
abstract
quality
figures
in
the
procession
it
arrests
our
attention
but
for
a
moment
and
fades
into
something
else
and
is
never
very
abstract
thus
in
thinking
of
the
we
may
have
a
gleam
of
admiration
at
the
gracefulness
of
the
primitive
human
mind
or
a
moment
of
disgust
at
the
narrowness
of
modern
interpreters
but
in
the
main
we
think
less
of
qualities
than
of
concrete
things
real
or
possible
just
as
we
may
experience
them
our
thought
here
may
be
rational
but
it
is
not
is
not
reasoning
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
term
in
reasoning
although
our
results
may
be
thought
of
as
concrete
things
they
are
suggested
immediately
by
other
concrete
as
in
the
trains
of
simply
associative
thought
they
are
linked
to
the
concretes
which
precede
them
by
intermediate
steps
and
these
steps
are
formed
by
general
articulately
denoted
and
expressly
analyzed
out
a
thing
inferred
by
reasoning
need
neither
have
been
an
habitual
associate
of
the
datum
from
which
we
infer
it
nor
need
it
be
similar
to
it
it
may
be
a
thing
entirely
unknown
to
our
previous
experience
something
which
no
simple
association
of
concretes
could
ever
have
evoked
the
great
difference
in
fact
between
that
simpler
kind
of
rational
thinking
which
consists
in
the
concrete
objects
of
past
experience
merely
suggesting
each
other
and
reasoning
distinctively
so
called
is
this
that
whilst
the
empirical
thinking
is
only
reproductive
reasoning
is
productive
an
empirical
or
thinker
can
deduce
nothing
from
data
with
whose
behavior
and
associates
in
the
concrete
he
is
unfamiliar
but
put
a
reasoner
amongst
a
set
of
concrete
objects
which
he
has
neither
seen
nor
heard
of
before
and
with
a
little
time
if
he
is
a
good
reasoner
he
will
make
such
inferences
from
them
as
will
quite
atone
for
his
ignorance
reasoning
helps
us
out
of
unprecedented
situations
situations
for
which
all
our
common
associative
wisdom
all
the
which
we
share
in
common
with
the
beasts
leaves
us
without
resource
definition
of
us
make
this
ability
to
deal
with
novel
data
the
technical
differentia
of
this
will
sufficiently
mark
it
out
from
common
associative
thinking
and
will
immediately
enable
us
to
say
just
what
peculiarity
it
contains
contains
analysis
and
whereas
the
merely
empirical
thinker
stares
at
a
fact
in
its
entirety
and
remains
helpless
or
gets
if
it
suggests
no
concomitant
or
similar
the
reasoner
breaks
it
up
and
notices
some
one
of
its
separate
attributes
this
attribute
he
takes
to
be
the
essential
part
of
the
whole
fact
before
him
this
attribute
has
properties
or
consequences
which
the
fact
until
then
was
not
known
to
have
but
which
now
that
it
is
noticed
to
contain
the
attribute
it
must
have
call
the
fact
or
concrete
datum
s
the
essential
attribute
m
the
attribute
property
then
the
reasoned
inference
of
p
from
s
can
not
be
made
without
intermediation
the
m
is
thus
that
third
or
middle
term
in
the
reasoning
which
a
moment
ago
was
pronounced
essential
his
original
concrete
s
the
reasoner
substitutes
its
abstract
property
what
is
true
of
m
what
is
coupled
with
m
thereupon
holds
true
of
s
is
coupled
with
as
m
is
properly
one
of
the
of
the
entire
s
may
then
be
very
well
defined
as
the
substitution
of
parts
and
their
implications
or
consequences
for
and
the
art
of
the
reasoner
will
consist
of
two
stages
first
or
the
ability
to
discover
what
part
m
lies
embedded
in
the
whole
s
which
is
before
him
second
or
the
ability
to
recall
promptly
m
consequences
concomitants
or
implications
if
we
glance
at
the
ordinary
syllogism
m
is
p
s
is
m
s
is
p
we
see
that
the
second
or
minor
premise
the
as
it
is
sometimes
called
is
the
one
requiring
the
sagacity
the
first
or
major
the
one
requiring
the
fertility
or
fulness
of
learning
usually
the
learning
is
more
apt
to
be
ready
than
the
sagacity
the
ability
to
seize
fresh
aspects
in
concrete
things
being
rarer
than
the
ability
to
learn
old
rules
so
that
in
most
actual
cases
of
reasoning
the
minor
premise
or
the
way
of
conceiving
the
subject
is
the
one
that
makes
the
novel
step
in
thought
this
is
to
be
sure
not
always
the
case
for
the
fact
that
m
carries
p
with
it
may
also
be
unfamiliar
and
now
formulated
for
the
first
time
the
perception
that
s
is
m
is
a
of
conceiving
the
statement
that
m
is
p
is
an
or
general
a
word
about
both
is
necessary
is
meant
by
a
mode
of
when
we
conceive
of
s
merely
as
m
of
vermilion
merely
as
a
for
example
we
neglect
all
the
other
attributes
which
it
may
have
and
attend
exclusively
to
this
one
we
mutilate
the
fulness
of
s
reality
every
reality
has
an
infinity
of
aspects
or
properties
even
so
simple
a
fact
as
a
line
which
you
trace
in
the
air
may
be
considered
in
respect
to
its
form
its
length
its
direction
and
its
location
when
we
reach
more
complex
facts
the
number
of
ways
in
which
we
may
regard
them
is
literally
endless
vermilion
is
not
only
a
it
is
vividly
red
heavy
and
expensive
it
comes
from
china
and
so
on
all
objects
are
of
properties
which
are
only
little
by
little
developed
to
our
knowledge
and
it
is
truly
said
that
to
know
one
thing
thoroughly
would
be
to
know
the
whole
universe
mediately
or
immediately
that
one
thing
is
related
to
everything
else
and
to
know
about
it
all
its
relations
need
be
known
but
each
relation
forms
one
of
its
attributes
one
angle
by
which
some
one
may
conceive
it
and
while
so
conceiving
it
may
ignore
the
rest
of
it
a
man
is
such
a
complex
fact
but
out
of
the
complexity
all
that
an
army
commissary
picks
out
as
important
for
his
purposes
is
his
property
of
eating
so
many
pounds
a
day
the
general
of
marching
so
many
miles
the
of
having
such
a
shape
the
orator
of
responding
to
such
and
such
feelings
the
of
being
willing
to
pay
just
such
a
price
and
no
more
for
an
evening
amusement
each
of
these
persons
singles
out
the
particular
side
of
the
entire
man
which
has
a
bearing
on
concerns
and
not
till
this
side
is
distinctly
and
separately
conceived
can
the
proper
practical
conclusions
that
be
drawn
and
when
they
are
drawn
the
man
other
attributes
may
be
ignored
all
ways
of
conceiving
a
concrete
fact
if
they
are
true
ways
at
all
are
equally
true
ways
is
no
absolutely
to
any
one
the
same
property
which
figures
as
the
essence
of
a
thing
on
one
occasion
becomes
a
very
inessential
feature
upon
another
now
that
i
am
writing
it
is
essential
that
i
conceive
my
paper
as
a
surface
for
inscription
if
i
failed
to
do
that
i
should
have
to
stop
my
work
but
if
i
wished
to
light
a
fire
and
no
other
materials
were
by
the
essential
way
of
conceiving
the
paper
would
be
as
combustible
material
and
i
need
then
have
no
thought
of
any
of
its
other
destinations
it
is
really
that
it
is
a
combustible
a
writing
surface
a
thin
thing
a
hydrocarbonaceous
thing
a
thing
eight
inches
one
way
and
ten
another
a
thing
just
one
furlong
east
of
a
certain
stone
in
my
neighbor
field
an
american
thing
whichever
one
of
these
aspects
of
its
being
i
temporarily
class
it
under
makes
me
unjust
to
the
other
aspects
but
as
i
always
am
classing
it
under
one
aspect
or
another
i
am
always
unjust
always
partial
always
exclusive
my
excuse
is
necessity
the
necessity
which
my
finite
and
practical
nature
lays
upon
me
my
thinking
is
first
and
last
and
always
for
the
sake
of
my
doing
and
i
can
only
do
one
thing
at
a
time
a
god
who
is
supposed
to
drive
the
whole
universe
abreast
may
also
be
supposed
without
detriment
to
his
activity
to
see
all
parts
of
it
at
once
and
without
emphasis
but
were
our
human
attention
so
to
disperse
itself
we
should
simply
stare
vacantly
at
things
at
large
and
forfeit
our
opportunity
of
doing
any
particular
act
warner
in
his
adirondack
story
shot
a
bear
by
aiming
not
at
his
eye
or
heart
but
him
generally
but
we
can
not
aim
at
the
universe
or
if
we
do
we
miss
our
game
our
scope
is
narrow
and
we
must
attack
things
piecemeal
ignoring
the
solid
fulness
in
which
the
elements
of
nature
exist
and
stringing
one
after
another
of
them
together
in
a
serial
way
to
suit
our
little
interests
as
they
change
from
hour
to
hour
in
this
the
partiality
of
one
moment
is
partly
atoned
for
by
the
different
sort
of
partiality
of
the
next
to
me
now
writing
these
words
emphasis
and
selection
seem
to
be
the
essence
of
the
human
mind
in
other
chapters
other
qualities
have
seemed
and
will
again
seem
more
important
parts
of
psychology
men
are
so
ingrainedly
partial
that
for
and
scholasticism
which
is
only
grown
articulate
the
notion
that
there
is
no
one
quality
genuinely
absolutely
and
exclusively
essential
to
anything
is
almost
unthinkable
a
thing
essence
makes
it
it
is
without
an
exclusive
essence
it
would
be
nothing
in
particular
would
be
quite
nameless
we
could
not
say
it
was
this
rather
than
that
what
you
write
on
for
example
why
talk
of
its
being
combustible
rectangular
and
the
like
when
you
know
that
these
are
mere
accidents
and
that
what
it
really
is
and
was
made
to
be
is
just
and
nothing
else
the
reader
is
pretty
sure
to
make
some
such
comment
as
this
but
he
is
himself
merely
insisting
on
an
aspect
of
the
thing
which
suits
his
own
petty
purpose
that
of
the
thing
or
else
on
an
aspect
which
suits
the
manufacturer
purpose
that
of
an
article
for
which
there
is
a
vulgar
meanwhile
the
reality
overflows
these
purposes
at
every
pore
our
usual
purpose
with
it
our
commonest
title
for
it
and
the
properties
which
this
title
suggests
have
in
reality
nothing
sacramental
they
characterize
more
than
they
characterize
the
thing
but
we
are
so
stuck
in
our
prejudices
so
petrified
intellectually
that
to
our
vulgarest
names
with
their
suggestions
we
ascribe
an
eternal
and
exclusive
worth
the
thing
must
be
essentially
what
the
vulgarest
name
connotes
what
less
usual
names
connote
it
can
be
only
in
an
and
relatively
unreal
sense
locke
undermined
the
fallacy
but
none
of
his
successors
so
far
as
i
know
have
radically
escaped
it
or
seen
that
only
meaning
of
essence
is
teleological
and
that
classification
and
conception
are
purely
teleological
weapons
of
the
the
essence
of
a
thing
is
that
one
of
its
properties
which
is
so
for
my
that
in
comparison
with
it
i
may
neglect
the
rest
amongst
those
other
things
which
have
this
important
property
i
class
it
after
this
property
i
name
it
as
a
thing
endowed
with
this
property
i
conceive
it
and
whilst
so
classing
naming
and
conceiving
it
all
other
truth
about
it
becomes
to
me
as
naught
the
properties
which
are
important
vary
from
man
to
man
and
from
hour
to
hour
hence
divers
appellations
and
conceptions
for
the
same
thing
but
many
objects
of
daily
use
as
paper
ink
butter
overcoat
have
properties
of
such
constant
unwavering
importance
and
have
such
stereotyped
names
that
we
end
by
believing
that
to
conceive
them
in
those
ways
is
to
conceive
them
in
the
only
true
way
those
are
no
truer
ways
of
conceiving
them
than
any
others
they
are
only
more
frequently
serviceable
ways
to
us
is
always
for
a
subjective
to
revert
now
to
our
symbolic
representation
of
the
reasoning
process
m
is
p
s
is
m
s
is
p
m
is
discerned
and
picked
out
for
the
time
being
to
be
the
essence
of
the
concrete
fact
phenomenon
or
reality
but
m
in
this
world
of
ours
is
inevitably
conjoined
with
p
so
that
p
is
the
next
thing
that
we
may
expect
to
find
conjoined
with
the
fact
we
may
conclude
or
infer
p
through
the
intermediation
of
the
m
which
our
sagacity
began
by
discerning
when
s
came
before
it
to
be
the
essence
of
the
case
now
note
that
if
p
have
any
value
or
importance
for
us
m
was
a
very
good
character
for
our
sagacity
to
pounce
upon
and
abstract
if
on
the
contrary
p
were
of
no
importance
some
other
character
than
m
would
have
been
a
better
essence
for
us
to
conceive
of
s
by
psychologically
as
a
rule
p
overshadows
the
process
from
the
start
we
are
p
or
something
like
but
the
bare
totality
of
s
does
not
yield
it
to
our
gaze
and
casting
about
for
some
point
in
s
to
take
hold
of
which
will
lead
us
to
p
we
hit
if
we
are
sagacious
upon
m
because
m
happens
to
be
just
the
character
which
is
knit
up
with
had
we
wished
q
instead
of
p
and
were
n
a
property
of
s
conjoined
with
q
we
ought
to
have
ignored
m
noticed
n
and
conceived
of
s
as
a
sort
of
n
exclusively
reasoning
is
always
to
attain
some
particular
conclusion
or
to
gratify
some
special
curiosity
it
not
only
breaks
up
the
datum
placed
before
it
and
conceives
it
abstractly
it
must
conceive
it
too
and
conceiving
it
rightly
means
conceiving
it
by
that
one
particular
abstract
character
which
leads
to
the
one
sort
of
conclusion
which
it
is
the
reasoner
temporary
interest
to
attain
the
of
reasoning
may
be
hit
upon
by
accident
the
stereoscope
was
actually
a
result
of
reasoning
it
is
conceivable
however
that
a
man
playing
with
pictures
and
mirrors
might
accidentally
have
hit
upon
it
cats
have
been
known
to
open
doors
by
pulling
latches
etc
but
no
cat
if
the
latch
got
out
of
order
could
open
the
door
again
unless
some
new
accident
of
random
fumbling
taught
her
to
associate
some
new
total
movement
with
the
total
phenomenon
of
the
closed
door
a
reasoning
man
however
would
open
the
door
by
first
analyzing
the
hindrance
he
would
ascertain
what
particular
feature
of
the
door
was
wrong
the
lever
does
not
raise
the
latch
sufficiently
from
its
slot
case
of
insufficient
elevation
raise
door
bodily
on
hinges
or
door
sticks
at
bottom
by
friction
against
sill
raise
it
bodily
up
how
it
is
obvious
that
a
child
or
an
idiot
might
without
this
reasoning
learn
the
for
opening
that
particular
door
i
remember
a
clock
which
the
had
discovered
would
not
go
unless
it
were
supported
so
as
to
tilt
slightly
forwards
she
had
stumbled
on
this
method
after
many
weeks
of
groping
the
reason
of
the
stoppage
was
the
friction
of
the
against
the
back
of
the
a
reason
which
an
educated
man
would
have
analyzed
out
in
five
minutes
i
have
a
lamp
of
which
the
flame
vibrates
most
unpleasantly
unless
the
chimney
be
raised
about
a
sixteenth
of
an
inch
i
learned
the
remedy
after
much
torment
by
accident
and
now
always
keep
the
chimney
up
with
a
small
wedge
but
my
procedure
is
a
mere
association
of
two
totals
diseased
object
and
remedy
one
learned
in
pneumatics
could
have
abstracted
the
of
the
disease
and
thence
inferred
the
remedy
immediately
by
many
measurements
of
triangles
one
might
find
their
area
always
equal
to
their
height
multiplied
by
half
their
base
and
one
might
formulate
an
empirical
law
to
that
effect
but
a
reasoner
saves
himself
all
this
trouble
by
seeing
that
it
is
the
essence
hac
of
a
triangle
to
be
the
half
of
a
parallelogram
whose
area
is
the
height
into
the
entire
base
to
see
this
he
must
invent
additional
lines
and
the
geometer
must
often
draw
such
to
get
at
the
essential
property
he
may
require
in
a
figure
the
essence
consists
in
some
of
the
figure
to
the
new
a
relation
not
obvious
at
all
until
they
are
put
in
the
geometer
genius
lies
in
the
imagining
of
the
new
lines
and
his
sagacity
in
the
perceiving
of
the
relation
there
are
two
great
points
in
an
extracted
character
is
taken
as
equivalent
to
the
entire
datum
from
which
it
comes
the
character
thus
taken
suggests
a
certain
consequence
more
obviously
than
it
was
suggested
by
the
total
datum
as
it
originally
take
these
points
again
successively
suppose
i
say
when
offered
a
piece
of
cloth
i
wo
buy
that
it
looks
as
if
it
would
fade
meaning
merely
that
something
about
it
suggests
the
idea
of
fading
to
my
mind
my
judgment
though
possibly
correct
is
not
reasoned
but
purely
empirical
but
if
i
can
say
that
into
the
color
there
enters
a
certain
dye
which
i
know
to
be
chemically
unstable
and
that
the
color
will
fade
my
judgment
is
reasoned
the
notion
of
the
dye
which
is
one
of
the
parts
of
the
cloth
is
the
connecting
link
between
the
latter
and
the
notion
of
fading
so
again
an
uneducated
man
will
expect
from
past
experience
to
see
a
piece
of
ice
melt
if
placed
near
the
fire
and
the
tip
of
his
finger
look
coarse
if
he
view
it
through
a
convex
glass
in
neither
of
these
cases
could
the
result
be
anticipated
without
full
previous
acquaintance
with
the
entire
phenomenon
it
is
not
a
result
of
reasoning
but
a
man
who
should
conceive
heat
as
a
mode
of
motion
and
liquefaction
as
identical
with
increased
motion
of
molecules
who
should
know
that
curved
surfaces
bend
in
special
ways
and
that
the
apparent
size
of
anything
is
connected
with
the
amount
of
the
of
its
as
they
enter
the
eye
such
a
man
would
make
the
right
inferences
for
all
these
objects
even
though
he
had
never
in
his
life
had
any
concrete
experience
of
them
and
he
would
do
this
because
the
ideas
which
we
have
above
supposed
him
to
possess
would
mediate
in
his
mind
between
the
phenomena
he
starts
with
and
the
conclusions
he
draws
but
these
ideas
are
all
mere
extracted
portions
or
circumstances
the
motions
which
form
heat
the
bending
of
the
are
it
is
true
excessively
recondite
ingredients
the
hidden
pendulum
i
spoke
of
above
is
less
so
and
the
sticking
of
a
door
on
its
sill
in
the
earlier
example
would
hardly
be
so
at
all
but
each
and
all
agree
in
this
that
they
bear
a
evident
to
the
conclusion
than
did
the
facts
in
their
immediate
totality
and
now
to
prove
the
second
point
why
are
the
couplings
consequences
and
implications
of
extracts
more
evident
and
obvious
than
those
of
entire
phenomena
for
two
reasons
first
the
extracted
characters
are
more
general
than
the
concretes
and
the
connections
they
may
have
are
therefore
more
familiar
to
us
having
been
more
often
met
in
our
experience
think
of
heat
as
motion
and
whatever
is
true
of
motion
will
be
true
of
heat
but
we
have
had
a
hundred
experiences
of
motion
for
every
one
of
heat
think
of
the
rays
passing
through
this
lens
as
bending
towards
the
perpendicular
and
you
substitute
for
the
comparatively
unfamiliar
lens
the
very
familiar
notion
of
a
particular
change
in
direction
of
a
line
of
which
notion
every
day
brings
us
countless
examples
the
other
reason
why
the
relations
of
the
extracted
characters
are
so
evident
is
that
their
properties
are
so
compared
with
the
properties
of
the
whole
from
which
we
derived
them
in
every
concrete
fact
the
characters
and
their
consequences
are
so
inexhaustibly
numerous
that
we
may
lose
our
way
among
them
before
noticing
the
particular
consequence
it
behooves
us
to
draw
but
if
we
are
lucky
enough
to
single
out
the
proper
character
we
take
in
as
it
were
by
a
single
glance
all
its
possible
consequences
thus
the
character
of
scraping
the
sill
has
very
few
suggestions
prominent
among
which
is
the
suggestion
that
the
scraping
will
cease
if
we
raise
the
door
whilst
the
entire
refractory
door
suggests
an
enormous
number
of
notions
to
the
mind
such
examples
may
seem
trivial
but
they
contain
the
essence
of
the
most
refined
and
transcendental
theorizing
the
reason
why
physics
grows
more
deductive
the
more
the
fundamental
properties
it
assumes
are
of
a
mathematical
sort
such
as
molecular
mass
or
is
that
the
immediate
consequences
of
these
notions
are
so
few
that
we
can
survey
them
all
at
once
and
promptly
pick
out
those
which
concern
us
to
reason
then
we
must
be
able
to
extract
characters
not
characters
but
the
right
characters
for
our
conclusion
if
we
extract
the
wrong
character
it
will
not
lead
to
that
conclusion
here
then
is
the
difficulty
are
characters
extracted
and
why
does
it
require
the
advent
of
a
genius
in
many
cases
before
the
fitting
character
is
brought
to
light
why
can
not
anybody
reason
as
well
as
anybody
else
why
does
it
need
a
newton
to
notice
the
law
of
the
squares
a
darwin
to
notice
the
survival
of
the
fittest
to
answer
these
questions
we
must
begin
a
new
research
and
see
how
our
insight
into
facts
naturally
grows
all
our
knowledge
at
first
is
vague
when
we
say
that
a
thing
is
vague
we
mean
that
it
has
no
subdivisions
nor
precise
limitations
but
still
all
the
forms
of
thought
may
apply
to
it
it
may
have
unity
reality
externality
extent
and
what
not
in
a
word
but
thinghood
only
as
a
whole
in
this
vague
way
probably
does
the
room
appear
to
the
babe
who
first
begins
to
be
conscious
of
it
as
something
other
than
his
moving
nurse
it
has
no
subdivisions
in
his
mind
unless
perhaps
the
window
is
able
to
attract
his
separate
notice
in
this
vague
way
certainly
does
every
entirely
new
experience
appear
to
the
adult
a
library
a
museum
a
are
mere
confused
wholes
to
the
uninstructed
but
the
machinist
the
antiquary
and
the
bookworm
perhaps
hardly
notice
the
whole
at
all
so
eager
are
they
to
pounce
upon
the
details
familiarity
has
in
them
bred
discrimination
such
vague
terms
as
and
do
not
exist
for
the
botanist
or
the
anatomist
they
know
too
much
about
grasses
moulds
and
muscles
a
certain
person
said
to
charles
kingsley
who
was
showing
him
the
dissection
of
a
caterpillar
with
its
exquisite
viscera
why
i
thought
it
was
nothing
but
skin
and
squash
a
layman
present
at
a
shipwreck
a
battle
or
a
fire
is
helpless
discrimination
has
been
so
little
awakened
in
him
by
experience
that
his
consciousness
leaves
no
single
point
of
the
complex
situation
accented
and
standing
out
for
him
to
begin
to
act
upon
but
the
sailor
the
fireman
and
the
general
know
directly
at
what
corner
to
take
up
the
business
they
into
the
situation
that
is
they
analyze
it
with
their
first
glance
it
is
full
of
delicately
differenced
ingredients
which
their
education
has
little
by
little
brought
to
their
consciousness
but
of
which
the
novice
gains
no
clear
idea
how
this
power
of
analysis
was
brought
about
we
saw
in
our
chapters
on
discrimination
and
attention
we
dissociate
the
elements
of
originally
vague
totals
by
attending
to
them
or
noticing
them
alternately
of
course
but
what
determines
which
element
we
shall
attend
to
first
there
are
two
immediate
and
obvious
answers
first
our
practical
or
instinctive
interests
and
second
our
Ã¦sthetic
interests
the
dog
singles
out
of
any
situation
its
smells
and
the
horse
its
sounds
because
they
may
reveal
facts
of
practical
moment
and
are
instinctively
exciting
to
these
several
creatures
the
infant
notices
the
or
the
window
and
ignores
the
rest
of
the
room
because
those
objects
give
him
a
vivid
pleasure
so
the
country
boy
dissociates
the
blackberry
the
chestnut
and
the
wintergreen
from
the
vague
mass
of
other
shrubs
and
trees
for
their
practical
uses
and
the
savage
is
delighted
with
the
beads
the
bits
of
brought
by
an
exploring
vessel
and
gives
no
heed
to
the
features
of
the
vessel
itself
which
is
too
much
beyond
his
sphere
these
Ã¦sthetic
and
practical
interests
then
are
the
weightiest
factors
in
making
particular
ingredients
stand
out
in
high
relief
what
they
lay
their
accent
on
that
we
notice
but
what
they
are
in
themselves
we
can
not
say
we
must
content
ourselves
here
with
simply
accepting
them
as
irreducible
ultimate
factors
in
determining
the
way
our
knowledge
grows
now
a
creature
which
has
few
instinctive
impulses
or
interests
practical
or
Ã¦sthetic
will
dissociate
few
characters
and
will
at
best
have
limited
reasoning
powers
whilst
one
whose
interests
are
very
varied
will
reason
much
better
man
by
his
immensely
varied
instincts
practical
wants
and
Ã¦sthetic
feelings
to
which
every
sense
contributes
would
by
dint
of
these
alone
be
sure
to
dissociate
vastly
more
characters
than
any
other
animal
and
accordingly
we
find
that
the
lowest
savages
reason
incomparably
better
than
the
highest
brutes
the
diverse
interests
lead
too
to
a
diversification
of
experiences
whose
accumulation
becomes
a
condition
for
the
play
of
that
of
dissociation
by
varying
of
which
i
treated
on
help
given
by
association
by
it
is
probable
also
that
man
association
by
has
much
to
do
with
those
discriminations
of
character
on
which
his
higher
flights
of
reasoning
are
based
as
this
latter
is
an
important
matter
and
as
little
or
nothing
was
said
of
it
in
the
chapter
on
discrimination
it
behooves
me
to
dwell
a
little
upon
it
here
what
does
the
reader
do
when
he
wishes
to
see
in
what
the
precise
likeness
or
difference
of
two
objects
lies
he
transfers
his
attention
as
rapidly
as
possible
backwards
and
forwards
from
one
to
the
other
the
rapid
alteration
in
consciousness
shakes
out
as
it
were
the
points
of
difference
or
agreement
which
would
have
slumbered
forever
unnoticed
if
the
consciousness
of
the
objects
compared
had
occurred
at
widely
distant
periods
of
time
what
does
the
scientific
man
do
who
searches
for
the
reason
or
law
embedded
in
a
phenomenon
he
deliberately
accumulates
all
the
instances
he
can
find
which
have
any
analogy
to
that
phenomenon
and
by
simultaneously
filling
his
mind
with
them
all
he
frequently
succeeds
in
detaching
from
the
collection
the
peculiarity
which
he
was
unable
to
formulate
in
one
alone
even
though
that
one
had
been
preceded
in
his
former
experience
by
all
of
those
with
which
he
now
at
once
confronts
it
these
examples
show
that
the
mere
general
fact
of
having
occurred
at
some
time
in
one
experience
with
varying
concomitants
is
not
by
itself
a
sufficient
reason
for
a
character
to
be
dissociated
now
we
need
something
more
we
need
that
the
varying
concomitants
should
in
all
their
variety
be
brought
into
consciousness
not
till
then
will
the
character
in
question
escape
from
its
adhesion
to
each
and
all
of
them
and
stand
alone
this
will
immediately
be
recognized
by
those
who
have
read
mill
logic
as
the
ground
of
utility
in
his
famous
methods
of
experimental
inquiry
the
methods
of
agreement
of
difference
of
residues
and
of
concomitant
variations
each
of
these
gives
a
list
of
analogous
instances
out
of
the
midst
of
which
a
character
may
roll
and
strike
the
mind
now
it
is
obvious
that
any
mind
in
which
association
by
similarity
is
highly
developed
is
a
mind
which
will
spontaneously
form
lists
of
instances
like
this
take
a
present
fact
with
a
character
in
it
the
mind
may
fail
at
first
to
notice
this
character
at
all
but
if
calls
up
and
these
being
phenomena
which
resemble
in
possessing
but
which
may
not
have
entered
for
months
into
the
experience
of
the
animal
who
now
experiences
why
plainly
such
association
performs
the
part
of
the
reader
deliberately
rapid
comparison
referred
to
above
and
of
the
systematic
consideration
of
like
cases
by
the
scientific
investigator
and
may
lead
to
the
noticing
of
in
an
abstract
way
certainly
this
is
obvious
and
no
conclusion
is
left
to
us
but
to
assert
that
after
the
few
most
powerful
practical
and
Ã¦sthetic
interests
our
chief
help
towards
noticing
those
special
characters
of
phenomena
which
when
once
possessed
and
named
are
used
as
reasons
class
names
essences
or
middle
terms
this
association
by
without
it
indeed
the
deliberate
procedure
of
the
scientific
man
would
be
impossible
he
could
never
collect
his
analogous
instances
but
it
operates
of
itself
in
minds
without
any
deliberation
spontaneously
collecting
analogous
instances
uniting
in
a
moment
what
in
nature
the
whole
breadth
of
space
and
time
keeps
separate
and
so
permitting
a
perception
of
identical
points
in
the
midst
of
different
circumstances
which
minds
governed
wholly
by
the
law
of
contiguity
could
never
begin
to
attain

in

them
up
in
rapid
succession
then
being
associated
almost
simultaneously
with
such
varying
concomitants
will
out
and
attract
our
separate
notice
if
so
much
is
clear
to
the
reader
he
will
be
willing
to
admit
that
the
mind
which
this
mode
of
association
most
will
from
its
better
opportunity
of
extricating
characters
be
the
one
most
prone
to
reasoned
thinking
whilst
on
the
other
hand
a
mind
in
which
we
do
not
detect
reasoned
thinking
will
probably
be
one
in
which
association
by
contiguity
holds
almost
exclusive
sway
geniuses
are
by
common
consent
considered
to
differ
from
ordinary
minds
by
an
unusual
development
of
association
by
similarity
one
of
professor
bain
best
strokes
of
work
is
the
exhibition
of
this
truth
it
applies
to
geniuses
in
the
line
of
reasoning
as
well
as
in
other
lines
reasoning
powers
of
as
the
genius
is
to
the
vulgarian
so
the
vulgar
human
mind
is
to
the
intelligence
of
a
brute
compared
with
men
it
is
probable
that
brutes
neither
attend
to
abstract
characters
nor
have
associations
by
similarity
their
thoughts
probably
pass
from
one
concrete
object
to
its
habitual
concrete
successor
far
more
uniformly
than
is
the
case
with
us
in
other
words
their
associations
of
ideas
are
almost
exclusively
by
contiguity
so
far
however
as
any
brute
might
think
by
abstract
characters
instead
of
by
the
association
of
concretes
he
would
have
to
be
admitted
to
be
a
reasoner
in
the
true
human
sense
how
far
this
may
take
place
is
quite
uncertain
certain
it
is
that
the
more
intelligent
brutes
abstract
characters
whether
they
mentally
single
them
out
as
such
or
not
they
act
upon
things
according
to
their
this
involves
some
sort
of
emphasizing
if
not
abstracting
of
the
by
the
animal
mind
a
concrete
individual
with
none
of
his
characters
emphasized
is
one
thing
a
sharply
conceived
attribute
marked
off
from
everything
else
by
a
name
is
another
but
between
no
analysis
of
a
concrete
and
complete
analysis
no
abstraction
of
an
embedded
character
and
complete
abstraction
every
possible
intermediary
grade
must
lie
and
some
of
these
grades
ought
to
have
names
for
they
are
certainly
represented
in
the
mind
romanes
has
proposed
the
name
and
lloyd
morgan
the
name
for
the
idea
of
a
vaguely
abstracted
and
generalized
a
definite
abstraction
is
called
an
by
the
latter
author
neither
nor
seems
to
me
a
felicitous
word
but
poor
as
both
are
they
form
a
distinct
addition
to
psychology
so
i
give
them
here
would
such
a
word
as
sound
better
than
in
the
following
passage
from
romanes
adopt
a
somewhat
different
mode
of
alighting
upon
land
or
even
upon
ice
from
that
which
they
adopt
when
alighting
upon
water
and
those
kinds
which
dive
from
a
height
such
as
terns
and
gannets
never
do
so
upon
land
or
upon
ice
these
facts
prove
that
the
animals
have
one
recept
answering
to
a
solid
surface
and
another
answering
to
a
fluid
similarly
a
man
will
not
dive
from
a
height
over
hard
ground
or
over
ice
nor
will
he
jump
into
water
in
the
same
way
as
he
jumps
upon
dry
land
in
other
words
like
the
he
has
two
distinct
recepts
one
of
which
answers
to
solid
ground
and
the
other
to
an
unresisting
fluid
but
unlike
the
he
is
able
to
bestow
upon
each
of
these
recepts
a
name
and
thus
to
raise
them
both
to
the
level
of
concepts
so
far
as
the
practical
purposes
of
locomotion
are
concerned
it
is
of
course
immaterial
whether
or
not
he
thus
raises
his
recepts
into
concepts
but
for
many
other
purposes
it
is
of
the
highest
importance
that
he
is
able
to
do
this
a
certain
retriever
of
whom
i
know
never
bit
his
birds
but
one
day
having
to
bring
two
birds
at
once
which
though
unable
to
fly
were
and
kicking
he
deliberately
gave
one
a
bite
which
killed
it
took
the
other
one
still
alive
to
his
master
and
then
returned
for
the
first
it
is
impossible
not
to
believe
that
some
such
abstract
thoughts
as
get
away
must
kill
passed
in
rapid
succession
through
this
dog
mind
whatever
the
sensible
imagery
may
have
been
with
which
they
were
blended
such
practical
obedience
to
the
special
aspects
of
things
which
may
be
important
involves
the
essence
of
reasoning
but
the
characters
whose
presence
impress
brutes
are
very
few
being
only
those
which
are
directly
connected
with
their
most
instinctive
interests
they
never
extract
characters
for
the
mere
fun
of
the
thing
as
men
do
one
is
tempted
to
explain
this
as
the
result
in
them
of
an
almost
entire
absence
of
such
association
by
similarity
as
characterizes
the
human
mind
a
thing
may
remind
a
brute
of
its
full
similars
but
not
of
things
to
which
it
is
but
slightly
similar
and
all
that
dissociation
by
varying
concomitants
which
in
man
is
based
so
largely
on
association
by
similarity
hardly
seems
to
take
place
at
all
in
the
mind
one
total
object
suggests
another
total
object
and
the
lower
mammals
find
themselves
acting
with
propriety
they
know
not
why
the
great
the
fundamental
defect
of
their
minds
seems
to
be
the
inability
of
their
groups
of
ideas
to
break
across
in
unaccustomed
places
they
are
enslaved
to
routine
to
thinking
and
if
the
most
prosaic
of
human
beings
could
be
transported
into
his
soul
he
would
be
appalled
at
the
utter
absence
of
fancy
which
there
reigns
thoughts
would
not
be
found
to
call
up
their
similars
but
only
their
habitual
successors
sunsets
would
not
suggest
heroes
deaths
but
this
is
why
man
is
the
only
metaphysical
animal
to
wonder
why
the
universe
should
be
as
it
is
presupposes
the
notion
of
its
being
different
and
a
brute
who
never
reduces
the
actual
to
fluidity
by
breaking
up
its
literal
sequences
in
his
imagination
can
never
form
such
a
notion
he
takes
the
world
simply
for
granted
and
never
wonders
at
it
at
all

consciousness
and

consciousness
is
the
reader
will
not
have
forgotten
in
the
jungle
of
purely
inward
processes
and
products
through
which
the
last
chapters
have
borne
him
that
the
final
result
of
them
all
must
be
some
form
of
bodily
activity
due
to
the
escape
of
the
central
excitement
through
outgoing
nerves
the
whole
neural
organism
it
will
be
remembered
is
physiologically
considered
but
a
machine
for
converting
stimuli
into
reactions
and
the
intellectual
part
of
our
life
is
knit
up
with
but
the
middle
or
part
of
the
machine
operations
we
now
go
on
to
consider
the
final
or
emergent
operations
the
bodily
activities
and
the
forms
of
consciousness
consequent
thereupon
every
impression
which
impinges
on
the
incoming
nerves
produces
some
discharge
down
the
outgoing
ones
whether
we
be
aware
of
it
or
not
using
sweeping
terms
and
ignoring
exceptions
might
say
that
every
possible
feeling
produces
a
movement
and
that
the
movement
is
a
movement
of
the
entire
organism
and
of
each
and
all
its
what
happens
patently
when
an
explosion
or
a
flash
of
lightning
startles
us
or
when
we
are
tickled
happens
latently
with
every
sensation
which
we
receive
the
only
reason
why
we
do
not
feel
the
startle
or
tickle
in
the
case
of
insignificant
sensations
is
partly
its
very
small
amount
partly
our
obtuseness
professor
bain
many
years
ago
gave
the
name
of
the
law
of
diffusion
to
this
phenomenon
of
general
discharge
and
expressed
it
thus
according
as
an
impression
is
accompanied
with
feeling
the
aroused
currents
diffuse
themselves
over
the
brain
leading
to
a
general
agitation
of
the
moving
organs
as
well
as
affecting
the
viscera
there
are
probably
no
exceptions
to
the
diffusion
of
every
impression
through
the
the
of
a
new
wave
through
the
centres
may
however
often
be
to
interfere
with
processes
already
going
on
there
and
the
outward
consequence
of
such
interference
may
be
the
checking
of
bodily
activities
in
process
of
occurrence
when
this
happens
it
probably
is
like
the
siphoning
of
certain
channels
by
currents
flowing
through
others
as
when
in
walking
we
suddenly
stand
still
because
a
sound
sight
smell
or
thought
catches
our
attention
but
there
are
cases
of
arrest
of
peripheral
activity
which
depend
not
on
inhibition
of
centres
but
on
stimulation
of
centres
which
discharge
outgoing
currents
of
an
inhibitory
sort
whenever
we
are
startled
for
example
our
heart
momentarily
stops
or
slows
its
beating
and
then
palpitates
with
accelerated
speed
the
brief
arrest
is
due
to
an
outgoing
current
down
the
pneumogastric
nerve
this
nerve
when
stimulated
stops
or
slows
the
and
this
particular
effect
of
startling
fails
to
occur
if
the
nerve
be
cut
in
general
however
the
stimulating
effects
of
a
proponderate
over
the
inhibiting
effects
so
that
we
may
roughly
say
as
we
began
by
saying
that
the
wave
of
discharge
produces
an
activity
in
all
parts
of
the
body
the
task
of
tracing
out
the
effects
of
any
one
incoming
sensation
has
not
yet
been
performed
by
physiologists
recent
years
have
however
begun
to
enlarge
our
information
and
we
have
now
experimental
proof
that
the
the
arterial
pressure
the
respiration
the
the
pupil
the
bladder
bowels
and
uterus
as
well
as
the
voluntary
muscles
may
have
their
tone
and
degree
of
contraction
altered
even
by
the
most
insignificant
sensorial
stimuli
in
short
a
set
up
anywhere
in
the
centres
reverberates
everywhere
and
in
some
way
or
other
affects
the
organism
throughout
making
its
activities
either
greater
or
it
is
as
if
the
mass
were
like
a
good
conductor
charged
with
electricity
of
which
the
tension
can
not
be
changed
at
all
without
changing
it
everywhere
at
once
herr
schneider
has
tried
to
show
by
an
ingenious
zoÃ¶logical
review
that
all
the
movements
which
highly
evolved
animals
make
are
differentiated
from
the
two
originally
simple
movements
of
contraction
and
expansion
in
which
the
entire
body
of
simple
organisms
takes
part
the
tendency
to
contract
is
the
source
of
all
the
impulses
and
reactions
which
are
later
developed
including
that
of
flight
the
tendency
to
expand
splits
up
on
the
contrary
into
the
impulses
and
instincts
of
an
aggressive
kind
feeding
fighting
sexual
intercourse
etc
i
cite
this
as
a
sort
of
evolutionary
reason
to
add
to
the
mechanical
reason
why
there
to
be
the
diffusive
wave
which
instances
show
to
exist
i
shall
now
proceed
to
a
detailed
study
of
the
more
important
classes
of
movement
consequent
upon
cerebromental
change
they
may
be
enumerated
as
expressions
of
emotion
instinctive
or
impulsive
performances
and
voluntary
deeds
and
each
shall
have
a
chapter
to
itself
chapter
xxiv
emotion
compared
with
an
emotion
is
a
tendency
to
feel
and
an
instinct
is
a
tendency
to
act
characteristically
when
in
presence
of
a
certain
object
in
the
environment
but
the
emotions
also
have
their
bodily
which
may
involve
strong
muscular
activity
as
in
fear
or
anger
for
example
and
it
becomes
a
little
hard
in
many
cases
to
separate
the
description
of
the
condition
from
that
of
the
reaction
which
one
and
the
same
object
may
provoke
shall
be
described
in
the
chapter
on
instincts
or
in
that
on
emotions
where
shall
one
describe
and
the
like
the
answer
is
quite
arbitrary
from
the
scientific
point
of
view
and
practical
convenience
may
decide
as
inner
mental
conditions
emotions
are
quite
indescribable
description
moreover
would
be
superfluous
for
the
reader
knows
already
how
they
feel
their
relations
to
the
objects
which
prompt
them
and
to
the
reactions
which
they
provoke
are
all
that
one
can
put
down
in
a
book
every
object
that
excites
an
instinct
excites
an
emotion
as
well
the
only
distinction
one
may
draw
is
that
the
reaction
called
emotional
terminates
in
the
subject
own
body
whilst
the
reaction
called
instinctive
is
apt
to
go
farther
and
enter
into
practical
relations
with
the
exciting
object
in
both
instinct
and
emotion
the
mere
memory
or
imagination
of
the
object
may
suffice
to
liberate
the
excitement
one
may
even
get
angrier
in
thinking
over
one
insult
than
one
was
in
receiving
it
and
melt
more
over
a
mother
who
is
dead
than
one
ever
did
when
she
was
living
in
the
rest
of
the
chapter
i
shall
use
the
word
of
emotion
indifferently
to
mean
one
which
is
physically
present
or
one
which
is
merely
thought
of
varieties
of
emotion
are
and
their
varieties
may
be
called
the
emotions
being
coupled
as
they
are
with
relatively
strong
bodily
reverberations
the
emotions
are
the
moral
intellectual
and
Ã¦sthetic
feelings
and
their
bodily
reaction
is
usually
much
less
strong
the
mere
description
of
the
objects
circumstances
and
varieties
of
the
different
species
of
emotion
may
go
to
any
length
their
internal
shadings
merge
endlessly
into
each
other
and
have
been
partly
commemorated
in
language
as
for
example
by
such
synonyms
as
hatred
antipathy
animosity
resentment
dislike
aversion
malice
spite
revenge
abhorrence
etc
dictionaries
of
synonyms
have
discriminated
them
as
well
as
of
psychology
in
fact
many
german
psychological
nothing
but
dictionaries
of
synonyms
when
it
comes
to
the
chapter
on
emotion
but
there
are
limits
to
the
profitable
elaboration
of
the
obvious
and
the
result
of
all
this
flux
is
that
the
merely
descriptive
literature
of
the
subject
from
descartes
downwards
is
one
of
the
most
tedious
parts
of
psychology
and
not
only
is
it
tedious
but
you
feel
that
its
subdivisions
are
to
a
great
extent
either
fictitious
or
unimportant
and
that
its
pretences
to
accuracy
are
a
sham
but
unfortunately
there
is
little
psychological
writing
about
the
emotions
which
is
not
merely
descriptive
as
emotions
are
described
in
novels
they
interest
us
for
we
are
made
to
share
them
we
have
grown
acquainted
with
the
concrete
objects
and
emergencies
which
call
them
forth
and
any
knowing
touch
of
introspection
which
may
grace
the
page
meets
with
a
quick
and
feeling
response
confessedly
literary
works
of
aphoristic
philosophy
also
flash
lights
into
our
emotional
life
and
give
us
a
fitful
delight
but
as
far
as
the
psychology
of
the
emotions
goes
i
may
have
been
surfeited
by
too
much
reading
of
classic
works
on
the
subject
but
i
should
as
lief
read
verbal
descriptions
of
the
shapes
of
the
rocks
on
a
new
hampshire
farm
as
toil
through
them
again
they
give
one
nowhere
a
central
point
of
view
or
a
deductive
or
generative
principle
they
distinguish
and
refine
and
specify
without
ever
getting
on
to
another
logical
level
whereas
the
beauty
of
all
truly
scientific
work
is
to
get
to
ever
deeper
levels
is
there
no
way
out
from
this
level
of
individual
description
in
the
case
of
the
emotions
i
believe
there
is
a
way
out
if
one
will
only
take
it
cause
of
their
the
trouble
with
the
emotions
in
psychology
is
that
they
are
regarded
too
much
as
absolutely
individual
things
so
long
as
they
are
set
down
as
so
many
eternal
and
sacred
psychic
entities
like
the
old
immutable
species
in
natural
history
so
long
all
that
be
done
with
them
is
reverently
to
catalogue
their
separate
characters
points
and
effects
but
if
we
regard
them
as
products
of
more
general
causes
as
are
now
regarded
as
products
of
heredity
and
variation
the
mere
distinguishing
and
cataloguing
becomes
of
subsidiary
importance
having
the
goose
which
lays
the
golden
eggs
the
description
of
each
egg
already
laid
is
a
minor
matter
i
will
devote
the
next
few
pages
to
setting
forth
one
very
general
cause
of
our
emotional
feeling
limiting
myself
in
the
first
instance
to
what
may
be
called
the
emotions
feeling
in
the
coarser
emotions
results
from
the
bodily
our
natural
way
of
thinking
about
these
coarser
emotions
is
that
the
mental
perception
of
some
fact
excites
the
mental
affection
called
the
emotion
and
that
this
latter
state
of
mind
gives
rise
to
the
bodily
expression
my
theory
on
the
contrary
is
that
bodily
changes
follow
directly
the
perception
of
the
exciting
fact
and
that
our
feeling
of
the
same
changes
as
they
is
says
we
lose
our
fortune
are
sorry
and
weep
we
meet
a
bear
are
frightened
and
run
we
are
insulted
by
a
rival
are
angry
and
strike
the
hypothesis
here
to
be
defended
says
that
this
order
of
sequence
is
incorrect
that
the
one
mental
state
is
not
immediately
induced
by
the
other
that
the
bodily
manifestations
must
first
be
interposed
between
and
that
the
more
rational
statement
is
that
we
feel
sorry
because
we
cry
angry
because
we
strike
afraid
because
we
tremble
and
not
that
we
cry
strike
or
tremble
because
we
are
sorry
angry
or
fearful
as
the
case
may
be
without
the
bodily
states
following
on
the
perception
the
latter
would
be
purely
cognitive
in
form
pale
colorless
destitute
of
emotional
warmth
we
might
then
see
the
bear
and
judge
it
best
to
run
receive
the
insult
and
deem
it
right
to
strike
but
we
should
not
actually
afraid
or
angry
stated
in
this
crude
way
the
hypothesis
is
pretty
sure
to
meet
with
immediate
disbelief
and
yet
neither
many
nor
considerations
are
required
to
mitigate
its
paradoxical
character
and
possibly
to
produce
conviction
of
its
truth
to
begin
with
perceptions
certainly
do
produce
bodily
effects
by
a
sort
of
immediate
physical
influence
antecedent
to
the
arousal
of
an
emotion
or
emotional
in
listening
to
poetry
drama
or
heroic
narrative
we
are
often
surprised
at
the
cutaneous
shiver
which
like
a
sudden
wave
flows
over
us
and
at
the
and
the
lachrymal
effusion
that
unexpectedly
catch
us
at
intervals
in
hearing
music
the
same
is
even
more
strikingly
true
if
we
abruptly
see
a
dark
moving
form
in
the
woods
our
heart
stops
beating
and
we
catch
our
breath
instantly
and
before
any
articulate
idea
of
danger
can
arise
if
our
friend
goes
near
to
the
edge
of
a
precipice
we
get
the
feeling
of
and
we
shrink
back
although
we
positively
him
to
be
safe
and
have
no
distinct
imagination
of
his
fall
the
writer
well
remembers
his
astonishment
when
a
boy
of
seven
or
eight
at
fainting
when
he
saw
a
horse
bled
the
blood
was
in
a
bucket
with
a
stick
in
it
and
if
memory
does
not
deceive
him
he
stirred
it
round
and
saw
it
drip
from
the
stick
with
no
feeling
save
that
of
childish
curiosity
suddenly
the
world
grew
black
before
his
eyes
his
ears
began
to
buzz
and
he
knew
no
more
he
had
never
heard
of
the
sight
of
blood
producing
faintness
or
sickness
and
he
had
so
little
repugnance
to
it
and
so
little
apprehension
of
any
other
sort
of
danger
from
it
that
even
at
that
tender
age
as
he
well
remembers
he
could
not
help
wondering
how
the
mere
physical
presence
of
a
pailful
of
crimson
fluid
could
occasion
in
him
such
formidable
bodily
effects
the
best
proof
that
the
immediate
cause
of
emotion
is
a
physical
effect
on
the
nerves
is
furnished
by
pathological
cases
in
which
the
emotion
is
one
of
the
chief
merits
in
fact
of
the
view
which
i
propose
seems
to
be
that
we
can
so
easily
formulate
by
its
means
pathological
cases
and
normal
cases
under
a
common
scheme
in
every
asylum
we
find
examples
of
absolutely
unmotived
fear
anger
melancholy
or
conceit
and
others
of
an
equally
unmotived
apathy
which
persists
in
spite
of
the
best
of
outward
reasons
why
it
should
give
way
in
the
former
cases
we
must
suppose
the
nervous
machinery
to
be
so
in
some
one
emotional
direction
that
almost
every
stimulus
however
inappropriate
causes
it
to
upset
in
that
way
and
to
engender
the
particular
complex
of
feelings
of
which
the
psychic
body
of
the
emotion
consists
thus
to
take
one
special
instance
if
inability
to
draw
deep
breath
fluttering
of
the
heart
and
that
peculiar
epigastric
change
felt
as
anxiety
with
an
irresistible
tendency
to
take
a
somewhat
crouching
attitude
and
to
sit
still
and
with
perhaps
other
visceral
processes
not
now
known
all
spontaneously
occur
together
in
a
certain
person
his
feeling
of
their
combination
the
emotion
of
dread
and
he
is
the
victim
of
what
is
known
as
morbid
fear
a
friend
who
has
had
occasional
attacks
of
this
most
distressing
of
all
maladies
tells
me
that
in
his
case
the
whole
drama
seems
to
centre
about
the
region
of
the
heart
and
respiratory
apparatus
that
his
main
effort
during
the
attacks
is
to
get
control
of
his
inspirations
and
to
slow
his
heart
and
that
the
moment
he
attains
to
breathing
deeply
and
to
holding
himself
erect
the
dread
seems
to
depart
the
emotion
here
is
nothing
but
the
feeling
of
a
bodily
state
and
it
has
a
purely
bodily
cause
the
next
thing
to
be
noticed
is
this
that
one
of
the
bodily
changes
whatsoever
it
be
felt
or
obscurely
the
moment
it
if
the
reader
has
never
paid
attention
to
this
matter
he
will
be
both
interested
and
astonished
to
learn
how
many
different
local
bodily
feelings
he
can
detect
in
himself
as
characteristic
of
his
various
emotional
moods
it
would
be
perhaps
too
much
to
expect
him
to
arrest
the
tide
of
any
strong
gust
of
passion
for
the
sake
of
any
such
curious
analysis
as
this
but
he
can
observe
more
tranquil
states
and
that
may
be
assumed
here
to
be
true
of
the
greater
which
is
shown
to
be
true
of
the
less
our
whole
cubic
capacity
is
sensibly
alive
and
each
morsel
of
it
contributes
its
pulsations
of
feeling
dim
or
sharp
pleasant
painful
or
dubious
to
that
sense
of
personality
that
every
one
of
us
unfailingly
carries
with
him
it
is
surprising
what
little
items
give
accent
to
these
complexes
of
sensibility
when
worried
by
any
slight
trouble
one
may
find
that
the
focus
of
one
bodily
consciousness
is
the
contraction
often
quite
inconsiderable
of
the
eyes
and
brows
when
momentarily
embarrassed
it
is
something
in
the
pharynx
that
compels
either
a
swallow
a
clearing
of
the
throat
or
a
slight
cough
and
so
on
for
as
many
more
instances
as
might
be
named
the
various
permutations
of
which
these
organic
changes
are
susceptible
make
it
abstractly
possible
that
no
shade
of
emotion
should
be
without
a
bodily
reverberation
as
unique
when
taken
in
its
totality
as
is
the
mental
mood
itself
the
immense
number
of
parts
modified
is
what
makes
it
so
difficult
for
us
to
reproduce
in
cold
blood
the
total
and
integral
expression
of
any
one
emotion
we
may
catch
the
trick
with
the
voluntary
muscles
but
fail
with
the
skin
glands
heart
and
other
viscera
just
as
an
artificially
imitated
sneeze
lacks
something
of
the
reality
so
the
attempt
to
imitate
grief
or
enthusiasm
in
the
absence
of
its
normal
instigating
cause
is
apt
to
be
rather
i
now
proceed
to
urge
the
vital
point
of
my
whole
theory
which
is
this
we
fancy
some
strong
emotion
and
then
try
to
abstract
from
our
consciousness
of
it
all
the
feelings
of
its
bodily
symptoms
we
find
we
have
nothing
left
no
out
of
which
the
emotion
can
be
constituted
and
that
a
cold
and
neutral
state
of
intellectual
perception
is
all
that
remains
it
is
true
that
although
most
people
when
asked
say
that
their
introspection
verifies
this
statement
some
persist
in
saying
theirs
does
not
many
can
not
be
made
to
understand
the
question
when
you
beg
them
to
imagine
away
every
feeling
of
laughter
and
of
tendency
to
laugh
from
their
consciousness
of
the
ludicrousness
of
an
object
and
then
to
tell
you
what
the
feeling
of
its
ludicrousness
would
be
like
whether
it
be
anything
more
than
the
perception
that
the
object
belongs
to
the
class
they
persist
in
replying
that
the
thing
proposed
is
a
physical
impossibility
and
that
they
always
laugh
if
they
see
a
funny
object
of
course
the
task
proposed
is
not
the
practical
one
of
seeing
a
ludicrous
object
and
annihilating
tendency
to
laugh
it
is
the
purely
speculative
one
of
subtracting
certain
elements
of
feeling
from
an
emotional
state
supposed
to
exist
in
its
fulness
and
saying
what
the
residual
elements
are
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
all
who
rightly
apprehend
this
problem
will
agree
with
the
proposition
above
laid
down
what
kind
of
an
emotion
of
fear
would
be
left
if
the
feeling
neither
of
quickened
nor
of
shallow
breathing
neither
of
trembling
lips
nor
of
weakened
limbs
neither
of
nor
of
visceral
stirrings
were
present
it
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
think
can
one
fancy
the
state
of
rage
and
picture
no
ebullition
in
the
chest
no
flushing
of
the
face
no
dilatation
of
the
nostrils
no
clenching
of
the
teeth
no
impulse
to
vigorous
action
but
in
their
stead
limp
muscles
calm
breathing
and
a
placid
face
the
present
writer
for
one
certainly
can
not
the
rage
is
as
completely
evaporated
as
the
sensation
of
its
manifestations
and
the
only
thing
that
can
possibly
be
supposed
to
take
its
place
is
some
and
dispassionate
judicial
sentence
confined
entirely
to
the
intellectual
realm
to
the
effect
that
a
certain
person
or
persons
merit
chastisement
for
their
sins
in
like
manner
of
grief
what
would
it
be
without
its
tears
its
sobs
its
suffocation
of
the
heart
its
pang
in
the
a
feelingless
cognition
that
certain
circumstances
are
deplorable
and
nothing
more
every
passion
in
turn
tells
the
same
story
a
disembodied
human
emotion
is
a
sheer
nonentity
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
a
contradiction
in
the
nature
of
things
or
that
pure
spirits
are
necessarily
condemned
to
cold
intellectual
lives
but
i
say
that
for
emotion
dissociated
from
all
bodily
feeling
is
inconceivable
the
more
closely
i
scrutinize
my
states
the
more
persuaded
i
become
that
whatever
affections
and
passions
i
have
are
in
very
truth
constituted
by
and
made
up
of
those
bodily
changes
which
we
ordinarily
call
their
expression
or
consequence
and
the
more
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
were
to
become
corporeally
anÃ¦sthetic
i
should
be
excluded
from
the
life
of
the
affections
harsh
and
tender
alike
and
drag
out
an
existence
of
merely
cognitive
or
intellectual
form
such
an
existence
although
it
seems
to
have
been
the
ideal
of
ancient
sages
is
too
apathetic
to
be
keenly
sought
after
by
those
born
after
the
revival
of
the
worship
of
sensibility
a
few
generations
ago
not
this
view
be
called
it
is
neither
more
nor
less
materialistic
than
any
other
view
which
says
that
our
emotions
are
conditioned
by
nervous
processes
no
reader
of
this
hook
is
likely
to
rebel
against
such
a
saying
so
long
as
it
is
expressed
in
general
terms
and
if
any
one
still
finds
materialism
in
the
thesis
now
defended
that
must
be
because
of
the
special
processes
invoked
they
are
processes
processes
due
to
inward
currents
set
up
by
physical
happenings
such
processes
have
it
is
true
always
been
regarded
by
the
platonizers
in
psychology
as
having
something
peculiarly
base
about
them
but
our
emotions
must
always
be
what
they
are
whatever
be
the
physiological
ground
of
their
apparition
if
they
are
deep
pure
worthy
spiritual
facts
on
any
conceivable
theory
of
their
physiological
source
they
remain
no
less
deep
pure
spiritual
and
worthy
of
regard
on
this
present
sensational
theory
they
carry
their
own
inner
measure
of
worth
with
them
and
it
is
just
as
logical
to
use
the
present
theory
of
the
emotions
for
proving
that
sensational
processes
need
not
be
vile
and
material
as
to
use
their
vileness
and
materiality
as
a
proof
that
such
a
theory
can
not
be
true
view
explains
the
great
variability
of
if
such
a
theory
is
true
then
each
emotion
is
the
resultant
of
a
sum
of
elements
and
each
element
is
caused
by
a
physiological
process
of
a
sort
already
well
known
the
elements
are
all
organic
changes
and
each
of
them
is
the
reflex
effect
of
the
exciting
object
definite
questions
now
immediately
arise
questions
very
different
from
those
which
were
the
only
possible
ones
without
this
view
those
were
questions
of
classification
which
are
the
proper
genera
of
emotion
and
which
the
species
under
each
or
of
description
by
what
expression
is
each
emotion
characterized
the
questions
now
are
just
what
changes
does
this
object
and
what
changes
does
that
object
excite
and
how
come
they
to
excite
these
particular
changes
and
not
others
we
step
from
a
superficial
to
a
deep
order
of
inquiry
classification
and
description
are
the
lowest
stage
of
science
they
sink
into
the
background
the
moment
questions
of
causation
are
formulated
and
remain
important
only
so
far
as
they
facilitate
our
answering
these
now
the
moment
an
emotion
is
causally
accounted
for
as
the
arousal
by
an
object
of
a
lot
of
reflex
acts
which
are
forthwith
felt
immediately
see
why
there
is
no
limit
to
the
number
of
possible
different
emotions
which
may
exist
and
why
the
emotions
of
different
individuals
may
vary
both
as
to
their
constitution
and
as
to
the
objects
which
call
them
forth
for
there
is
nothing
sacramental
or
eternally
fixed
in
reflex
action
any
sort
of
reflex
effect
is
possible
and
reflexes
actually
vary
indefinitely
as
we
know
in
short
classification
of
the
emotions
is
seen
to
be
as
true
and
as
as
any
if
it
only
serves
some
purpose
and
such
a
question
as
what
is
the
or
expression
of
anger
or
fear
is
seen
to
have
no
objective
meaning
at
all
instead
of
it
we
now
have
the
question
as
to
how
any
given
of
anger
or
fear
may
have
come
to
exist
and
that
is
a
real
question
of
physiological
mechanics
on
the
one
hand
and
of
history
on
the
other
which
like
all
real
questions
is
in
essence
answerable
although
the
answer
may
be
hard
to
find
on
a
later
page
i
shall
mention
the
attempts
to
answer
it
which
have
been
made
corollary
if
our
theory
be
true
a
necessary
corollary
of
it
ought
to
be
this
that
any
voluntary
and
arousal
of
the
manifestations
of
a
special
emotion
should
give
us
the
emotion
itself
now
within
the
limits
in
which
it
can
be
verified
experience
corroborates
rather
than
disproves
this
inference
everyone
knows
how
panic
is
increased
by
flight
and
how
the
giving
way
to
the
symptoms
of
grief
or
anger
increases
those
passions
themselves
each
fit
of
sobbing
makes
the
sorrow
more
acute
and
calls
forth
another
fit
stronger
still
until
at
last
repose
only
ensues
with
lassitude
and
with
the
apparent
exhaustion
of
the
machinery
in
rage
it
is
notorious
how
we
ourselves
up
to
a
climax
by
repeated
outbreaks
of
expression
refuse
to
express
a
passion
and
it
dies
count
ten
before
venting
your
anger
and
its
occasion
seems
ridiculous
whistling
to
keep
up
courage
is
no
mere
figure
of
speech
on
the
other
hand
sit
all
day
in
a
moping
posture
sigh
and
reply
to
everything
with
a
dismal
voice
and
your
melancholy
lingers
there
is
no
more
valuable
precept
in
moral
education
than
this
as
all
who
have
experience
know
if
we
wish
to
conquer
undesirable
emotional
tendencies
in
ourselves
we
must
assiduously
and
in
the
first
instance
go
through
the
of
those
contrary
dispositions
which
we
prefer
to
cultivate
the
reward
of
persistency
will
infallibly
come
in
the
fading
out
of
the
sullenness
or
depression
and
the
advent
of
real
cheerfulness
and
kindliness
in
their
stead
smooth
the
brow
brighten
the
eye
contract
the
dorsal
rather
than
the
ventral
aspect
of
the
frame
and
speak
in
a
major
key
pass
the
genial
compliment
and
your
heart
must
be
frigid
indeed
if
it
do
not
gradually
thaw
against
this
it
is
to
be
said
that
many
actors
who
perfectly
mimic
the
outward
appearances
of
emotion
in
face
gait
and
voice
declare
that
they
feel
no
emotion
at
all
others
however
according
to
wm
archer
who
has
made
a
very
instructive
statistical
inquiry
among
them
say
that
the
emotion
of
the
part
masters
them
whenever
they
play
it
well
the
explanation
for
the
discrepancy
amongst
actors
is
probably
simple
the
and
part
of
the
expression
can
be
suppressed
in
some
men
but
not
in
others
and
on
this
it
must
be
that
the
chief
part
of
the
felt
emotion
depends
those
actors
who
feel
the
emotion
are
probably
unable
those
who
are
inwardly
cold
are
probably
able
to
affect
the
dissociation
in
a
complete
way
objection
replied
it
may
be
objected
to
the
general
theory
which
i
maintain
that
stopping
the
expression
of
an
emotion
often
makes
it
worse
the
funniness
becomes
quite
excruciating
when
we
are
forbidden
by
the
situation
to
laugh
and
anger
pent
in
by
fear
turns
into
tenfold
hate
expressing
either
emotion
freely
however
gives
relief
this
objection
is
more
specious
than
real
the
expression
the
emotion
is
always
felt
it
the
centres
having
normally
discharged
themselves
we
feel
it
no
more
but
where
the
facial
part
of
the
discharge
is
suppressed
the
thoracic
and
visceral
may
be
all
the
more
violent
and
persistent
as
in
suppressed
laughter
or
the
original
emotion
may
be
changed
by
the
combination
of
the
provoking
object
with
the
restraining
pressure
into
emotion
in
which
different
and
possibly
profounder
organic
disturbance
occurs
if
i
would
kill
my
enemy
but
dare
not
my
emotion
is
surely
altogether
other
than
that
which
would
possess
me
if
i
let
my
anger
on
the
whole
therefore
this
objection
has
no
weight
subtler
in
the
Ã¦sthetic
emotions
the
bodily
reverberation
and
the
feeling
may
both
be
faint
a
connoisseur
is
apt
to
judge
a
work
of
art
dryly
and
intellectually
and
with
no
bodily
thrill
on
the
other
hand
works
of
art
may
arouse
intense
emotion
and
whenever
they
do
so
the
experience
is
completely
covered
by
the
terms
of
our
theory
our
theory
requires
that
be
the
basis
of
emotion
but
whether
secondary
organic
reverberations
be
or
be
not
aroused
by
it
the
perception
of
a
work
of
art
music
decoration
etc
is
always
in
the
first
instance
at
any
rate
an
affair
of
incoming
currents
the
work
itself
is
an
object
of
sensation
and
the
perception
of
an
object
of
sensation
being
a
or
vivid
experience
what
pleasure
goes
with
it
will
partake
of
the
or
vivid
form
that
there
may
be
subtle
pleasure
too
i
do
not
deny
in
other
words
there
may
be
purely
cerebral
emotion
independent
of
all
currents
from
outside
such
feelings
as
moral
satisfaction
thankfulness
curiosity
relief
at
getting
a
problem
solved
may
be
of
this
sort
but
the
thinness
and
paleness
of
these
feelings
when
unmixed
with
bodily
effects
is
in
very
striking
contrast
to
the
coarser
emotions
in
all
sentimental
and
impressionable
people
the
bodily
effects
mix
in
the
voice
breaks
and
the
eyes
moisten
when
the
moral
truth
is
felt
etc
wherever
there
is
anything
like
however
intellectual
its
ground
we
find
these
secondary
processes
ensue
unless
we
actually
laugh
at
the
neatness
of
the
demonstration
or
witticism
unless
we
thrill
at
the
case
of
justice
or
tingle
at
the
act
of
magnanimity
our
state
of
mind
can
hardly
be
called
emotional
at
all
it
is
in
fact
a
mere
intellectual
perception
of
how
certain
things
are
to
be
called
neat
right
witty
generous
and
the
like
such
a
judicial
state
of
mind
as
this
is
to
be
classed
among
cognitive
rather
than
among
emotional
acts
of
for
the
reasons
given
on
i
will
append
no
inventory
or
classification
of
emotions
or
description
of
their
symptoms
the
reader
has
practically
almost
all
the
facts
in
his
own
hand
as
an
example
however
of
the
best
sort
of
descriptive
work
on
the
symptoms
i
will
quote
darwin
account
of
them
in
fear
fear
is
often
preceded
by
astonishment
and
is
so
far
akin
to
it
that
both
lead
to
the
senses
of
sight
and
hearing
being
instantly
aroused
in
both
cases
the
eyes
and
mouth
are
widely
opened
and
the
eyebrows
raised
the
frightened
man
at
first
stands
like
a
statue
motionless
and
breathless
or
crouches
down
as
if
instinctively
to
escape
observation
the
heart
beats
quickly
and
violently
so
that
it
palpitates
or
knocks
against
the
ribs
but
it
is
very
doubtful
if
it
then
works
more
efficiently
than
usual
so
as
to
send
a
greater
supply
of
blood
to
all
parts
of
the
body
for
the
skin
instantly
becomes
pale
as
during
incipient
faintness
this
paleness
of
the
surface
however
is
probably
in
large
part
or
is
exclusively
due
to
the
centre
being
affected
in
such
a
manner
as
to
cause
the
contraction
of
the
small
arteries
of
the
skin
that
the
skin
is
much
affected
under
the
sense
of
great
fear
we
see
in
the
marvellous
manner
in
which
perspiration
immediately
exudes
from
it
this
exudation
is
all
the
more
remarkable
as
the
surface
is
then
cold
and
hence
the
term
a
cold
sweat
whereas
the
sudorific
glands
are
properly
excited
into
action
when
the
surface
is
heated
the
hairs
also
on
the
skin
stand
erect
and
the
superficial
muscles
shiver
in
connection
with
the
disturbed
action
of
the
heart
the
breathing
is
hurried
the
salivary
glands
act
imperfectly
the
mouth
becomes
dry
and
is
often
opened
and
shut
i
have
also
noticed
that
under
slight
fear
there
is
strong
tendency
to
yawn
one
of
the
best
marked
symptoms
is
the
trembling
of
all
the
muscles
of
the
body
and
this
is
often
first
seen
in
the
lips
from
this
cause
and
from
the
dryness
of
the
mouth
the
voice
becomes
husky
or
indistinct
or
may
altogether
fail
steteruntque
comÃ¦
et

as
fear
increases
into
an
agony
of
terror
we
behold
as
under
all
violent
emotions
diversified
results
the
heart
beats
wildly
or
must
fail
to
act
and
faintness
ensue
there
is
a
pallor
the
breathing
is
labored
the
wings
of
the
nostrils
are
widely
dilated
there
is
a
gasping
and
convulsive
motion
of
the
lips
a
tremor
on
the
hollow
cheek
a
gulping
and
catching
of
the
throat
the
uncovered
and
protruding
eyeballs
are
fixed
on
the
object
of
terror
or
they
may
roll
restlessly
from
side
to
side
illuc

the
pupils
are
said
to
be
enormously
dilated
all
the
muscles
of
the
body
may
become
rigid
or
may
be
thrown
into
convulsive
movements
the
hands
are
alternately
clenched
and
opened
often
with
a
twitching
movement
the
arms
may
be
protruded
as
if
to
avert
some
dreadful
danger
or
may
be
thrown
wildly
over
the
head
the
rev
hagenauer
has
seen
this
latter
action
in
a
terrified
australian
in
other
cases
there
is
a
sudden
and
uncontrollable
tendency
to
headlong
flight
and
so
strong
is
this
that
the
boldest
soldiers
may
be
seized
with
a
sudden
panic
of
the
emotional
how
come
the
various
objects
which
excite
emotion
to
produce
such
special
and
different
bodily
effects
this
question
was
not
asked
till
quite
recently
but
already
some
interesting
suggestions
towards
answering
it
have
been
made
some
movements
of
expression
can
be
accounted
for
as
repetitions
of
movements
which
when
they
were
stronger
of
utility
to
the
others
are
similarly
weakened
repetitions
of
movements
which
under
other
conditions
were
necessary
concomitants
of
the
useful
of
the
latter
reactions
the
respiratory
disturbances
in
anger
and
fear
might
be
taken
as
examples
organic
reminiscences
as
it
were
reverberations
in
imagination
of
the
blowings
of
the
man
making
a
series
of
combative
efforts
of
the
pantings
of
one
in
precipitate
flight
such
at
least
is
a
suggestion
made
by
spencer
which
has
found
approval
and
he
also
was
the
first
so
far
as
i
know
to
suggest
that
other
movements
in
anger
and
fear
could
be
explained
by
the
nascent
excitation
of
formerly
useful
acts
to
have
in
a
slight
degree
he
says
such
psychical
states
as
accompany
the
reception
of
wounds
and
are
experienced
during
flight
is
to
be
in
a
state
of
what
we
call
fear
and
to
have
in
a
slight
degree
such
psychical
states
as
the
processes
of
catching
killing
and
eating
imply
is
to
have
the
desires
to
catch
kill
and
eat
that
the
propensities
to
the
acts
are
nothing
else
than
nascent
excitations
of
the
psychical
state
involved
in
the
acts
is
proved
by
the
natural
language
of
the
propensities
fear
when
strong
expresses
itself
in
cries
in
efforts
to
escape
in
palpitations
in
tremblings
and
these
are
just
the
manifestations
that
go
along
with
an
actual
suffering
of
the
evil
feared
the
destructive
passion
is
shown
in
a
general
tension
of
the
muscular
system
in
gnashing
of
teeth
and
protrusion
of
the
claws
in
dilated
eyes
and
nostrils
in
growls
and
these
are
weaker
forms
of
the
actions
that
accompany
the
killing
of
prey
to
such
objective
evidences
every
one
can
add
subjective
evidences
everyone
can
testify
that
the
psychical
state
called
fear
consists
of
mental
representations
of
certain
painful
results
and
that
the
one
called
anger
consists
of
mental
representations
of
the
actions
and
impressions
which
would
occur
while
inflicting
some
kind
of
pain
the
principle
of
in
weakened
form
of
reactions
useful
in
more
violent
dealings
with
the
object
inspiring
the
has
found
many
applications
so
slight
a
symptom
as
the
snarl
or
sneer
the
uncovering
of
the
upper
teeth
is
accounted
for
by
darwin
as
a
survival
from
the
time
when
our
ancestors
had
large
canines
and
unfleshed
them
as
dogs
now
do
for
attack
similarly
the
raising
of
the
eyebrows
in
outward
attention
the
opening
of
the
mouth
in
astonishment
come
according
to
the
same
author
from
the
utility
of
these
movements
in
extreme
cases
the
raising
of
the
eyebrows
goes
with
the
opening
of
the
eye
for
better
vision
the
opening
of
the
mouth
with
the
intensest
listening
and
with
the
rapid
catching
of
the
breath
which
precedes
muscular
effort
the
distention
of
the
nostrils
in
anger
is
interpreted
by
spencer
as
an
echo
of
the
way
in
which
our
ancestors
had
to
breathe
when
during
combat
their
mouth
was
filled
up
by
a
part
of
an
antagonist
body
that
had
been
seized
the
trembling
of
fear
is
supposed
by
mantegazza
to
be
for
the
sake
of
warming
the
blood
the
reddening
of
the
face
and
neck
is
called
by
wundt
a
compensatory
arrangement
for
relieving
the
brain
of
the
which
the
simultaneous
excitement
of
the
heart
brings
with
it
the
effusion
of
tears
is
explained
both
by
this
author
and
by
darwin
to
be
a
agency
of
a
similar
sort
the
contraction
of
the
muscles
around
the
eyes
of
which
the
primitive
use
is
to
protect
those
organs
from
being
too
much
gorged
with
blood
during
the
screaming
fits
of
infancy
survives
in
adult
life
in
the
shape
of
the
frown
which
instantly
comes
over
the
brow
when
anything
difficult
or
displeasing
presents
itself
either
to
thought
or
action
as
the
habit
of
contracting
the
brows
has
been
followed
by
infants
during
innumerable
generations
at
the
commencement
of
every
crying
or
screaming
fit
says
darwin
it
has
become
firmly
associated
with
the
incipient
sense
of
something
distressing
or
disagreeable
hence
under
similar
circumstances
it
would
be
apt
to
be
continued
during
maturity
although
never
then
developed
into
a
crying
fit
screaming
or
weeping
begins
to
be
voluntarily
restrained
at
an
early
period
of
life
whereas
frowning
is
hardly
ever
restrained
at
any
age
another
principle
to
which
darwin
perhaps
hardly
does
sufficient
justice
may
be
called
the
principle
of
similarly
to
there
is
a
whole
vocabulary
of
descriptive
adjectives
common
to
impressions
belonging
to
different
sensible
spheres
experiences
of
all
classes
are
impressions
of
all
classes
or
sensations
of
all
classes
wundt
and
piderit
accordingly
explain
many
of
our
most
expressive
reactions
upon
moral
causes
as
symbolic
gustatory
movements
as
soon
as
any
experience
arises
which
has
an
affinity
with
the
feeling
of
sweet
or
bitter
or
sour
the
same
movements
are
executed
which
would
result
from
the
taste
in
point
all
the
states
of
mind
which
language
designates
by
the
metaphors
bitter
harsh
sweet
combine
themselves
therefore
with
the
corresponding
mimetic
movements
of
the
mouth
certainly
the
emotions
of
disgust
and
satisfaction
do
express
themselves
in
this
mimetic
way
disgust
is
an
incipent
regurgitation
or
retching
limiting
its
expression
often
to
the
grimace
of
the
lips
and
nose
satisfaction
goes
with
a
sucking
smile
or
tasting
motion
of
the
lips
the
ordinary
gesture
of
negation
among
us
moving
the
head
about
its
axis
from
side
to
side
is
a
reaction
originally
used
by
babies
to
keep
disagreeables
from
getting
into
their
mouth
and
may
be
observed
in
perfection
in
any
nursery
it
is
now
evoked
where
the
stimulus
is
only
an
unwelcome
idea
similarly
the
nod
forward
in
affirmation
is
after
the
analogy
of
taking
food
into
the
mouth
the
connection
of
the
expression
of
moral
or
social
disdain
or
dislike
especially
in
women
with
movements
having
a
perfectly
definite
original
olfactory
function
is
too
obvious
for
comment
winking
is
the
effect
of
any
threatening
surprise
not
only
of
what
puts
the
eyes
in
danger
and
a
momentary
aversion
of
the
eyes
is
very
apt
to
be
one
first
symptom
of
response
to
an
unexpectedly
unwelcome
these
may
suffice
as
examples
of
movements
expressive
from
analogy
but
if
certain
of
our
emotional
reactions
can
be
explained
by
the
two
principles
invoked
and
the
reader
will
himself
have
felt
how
conjectural
and
fallible
in
some
of
the
instances
the
explanation
is
there
remain
many
reactions
which
can
not
so
be
explained
at
all
and
these
we
must
write
down
for
the
present
as
purely
idiopathic
effects
of
the
stimulus
amongst
them
are
the
effects
on
the
viscera
and
internal
glands
the
dryness
of
the
mouth
and
diarrhÅa
and
nausea
of
fear
the
which
sometimes
produce
jaundice
after
excessive
rage
the
urinary
secretion
of
sanguine
excitement
and
the
of
apprehension
the
gaping
of
expectancy
the
in
the
throat
of
grief
the
tickling
there
and
the
swallowing
of
embarrassment
the
anxiety
of
dread
the
changes
in
the
pupil
the
various
sweatings
of
the
skin
cold
or
hot
local
or
general
and
its
flushings
together
with
other
symptoms
which
probably
exist
but
are
too
hidden
to
have
been
noticed
or
named
trembling
which
is
found
in
many
excitements
besides
that
of
terror
is
spencer
and
sig
mantegazza
quite
pathological
so
are
terror
other
strong
symptoms
they
are
harmful
to
the
creature
who
presents
them
in
an
organism
as
complex
as
the
nervous
system
there
must
be
many
reactions
which
would
never
themselves
have
been
evolved
independently
for
any
utility
they
might
possess
ticklishness
shyness
the
love
of
music
of
the
various
intoxicants
nay
the
entire
Ã¦sthetic
life
of
man
must
be
traced
to
this
accidental
origin
it
would
be
foolish
to
suppose
that
none
of
the
reactions
called
emotional
could
have
arisen

instinct
is
usually
defined
as
the
faculty
of
acting
in
such
a
way
as
to
produce
certain
ends
without
foresight
of
the
ends
and
without
previous
education
in
the
instincts
are
the
functional
correlatives
of
structure
with
the
presence
of
a
certain
organ
goes
one
may
say
almost
always
a
native
aptitude
for
its
use
the
actions
we
call
instinctive
all
conform
to
the
general
reflex
type
they
are
called
forth
by
determinate
sensory
stimuli
in
contact
with
the
animal
body
or
at
a
distance
in
his
environment
the
cat
runs
after
the
mouse
runs
or
shows
fight
before
the
dog
avoids
falling
from
walls
and
trees
shuns
fire
and
water
not
because
he
has
any
notion
either
of
life
or
of
death
or
of
self
or
of
preservation
he
has
probably
attained
to
no
one
of
these
conceptions
in
such
a
way
as
to
react
definitely
upon
it
he
acts
in
each
case
separately
and
simply
because
he
can
not
help
it
being
so
framed
that
when
that
particular
running
thing
called
a
mouse
appears
in
his
field
of
vision
he
pursue
that
when
that
particular
barking
and
obstreperous
thing
called
a
dog
appears
there
he
retire
if
at
a
distance
and
scratch
if
close
by
that
he
withdraw
his
feet
from
water
and
his
face
from
flame
etc
his
nervous
system
is
to
a
great
extent
a
preorganized
bundle
of
such
reactions
they
are
as
fatal
as
sneezing
and
as
exactly
correlated
to
their
special
excitants
as
it
is
to
its
own
although
the
naturalist
may
for
his
own
convenience
class
these
reactions
under
general
heads
he
must
not
forget
that
in
the
animal
it
is
a
particular
sensation
or
perception
or
image
which
calls
them
forth
at
first
this
view
astounds
us
by
the
enormous
number
of
special
adjustments
it
supposes
animals
to
possess
in
anticipation
of
the
outer
things
among
which
they
are
to
dwell
mutual
dependence
be
so
intricate
and
go
so
far
is
each
thing
born
fitted
to
particular
other
things
and
to
them
exclusively
as
locks
are
fitted
to
their
keys
undoubtedly
this
must
be
believed
to
be
so
each
nook
and
cranny
of
creation
down
to
our
very
skin
and
entrails
has
its
living
inhabitants
with
organs
suited
to
the
place
to
devour
and
digest
the
food
it
harbors
and
to
meet
the
dangers
it
conceals
and
the
minuteness
of
adaptation
thus
shown
in
the
way
of
knows
no
bounds
even
so
are
there
no
bounds
to
the
minuteness
of
adaptation
in
the
way
of
which
the
several
inhabitants
display
the
older
writings
on
instinct
are
ineffectual
wastes
of
words
because
their
authors
never
came
down
to
this
definite
and
simple
point
of
view
but
smothered
everything
in
vague
wonder
at
the
clairvoyant
and
prophetic
power
of
the
animals
so
superior
to
anything
in
man
and
at
the
beneficence
of
god
in
endowing
them
with
such
a
gift
but
beneficence
endows
them
first
of
all
with
a
nervous
system
and
turning
our
attention
to
this
makes
instinct
immediately
appear
neither
more
nor
less
wonderful
than
all
the
other
facts
of
life
instinct
is
an
whether
we
shall
call
such
impulses
as
blushing
sneezing
coughing
smiling
or
dodging
or
keeping
time
to
music
instincts
or
not
is
a
mere
matter
of
terminology
the
process
is
the
same
throughout
in
his
delightfully
fresh
and
interesting
work
thierische
wille
herr
schneider
subdivides
impulses
into
and
to
crouch
from
cold
is
a
to
turn
and
follow
if
we
see
people
running
one
way
is
a
to
cast
about
for
cover
if
it
begins
to
blow
and
rain
is
an
a
single
complex
instinctive
action
may
involve
successively
the
awakening
of
impulses
of
all
three
classes
thus
a
hungry
lion
starts
to
prey
by
the
awakening
in
him
of
imagination
coupled
with
desire
he
begins
to
it
when
on
eye
ear
or
nostril
he
gets
an
impression
of
its
presence
at
a
certain
distance
he
upon
it
either
when
the
booty
takes
alarm
and
flees
or
when
the
distance
is
sufficiently
reduced
he
proceeds
to
and
it
the
moment
he
gets
a
sensation
of
its
contact
with
his
claws
and
fangs
seeking
stalking
springing
and
devouring
are
just
so
many
different
kinds
of
muscular
contraction
and
neither
kind
is
called
forth
by
the
stimulus
appropriate
to
the
other
why
do
the
various
animals
do
what
seem
to
us
such
strange
in
the
presence
of
such
outlandish
stimuli
why
does
the
hen
for
example
submit
herself
to
the
tedium
of
incubating
such
a
fearfully
uninteresting
set
of
objects
as
a
nestful
of
eggs
unless
she
have
some
sort
of
a
prophetic
inkling
of
the
result
the
only
answer
is
we
can
only
interpret
the
instincts
of
brutes
by
what
we
know
of
instincts
in
ourselves
why
do
men
always
lie
down
when
they
can
on
soft
beds
rather
than
on
hard
floors
why
do
they
sit
round
the
stove
on
a
cold
day
why
in
a
room
do
they
place
themselves
times
out
of
a
hundred
with
their
faces
towards
its
middle
rather
than
to
the
wall
why
do
they
prefer
saddle
of
mutton
and
champagne
to
and
why
does
the
maiden
interest
the
youth
so
that
everything
about
her
seems
more
important
and
significant
than
anything
else
in
the
world
nothing
more
can
be
said
than
that
these
are
human
ways
and
that
every
creature
its
own
ways
and
takes
to
the
following
them
as
a
matter
of
course
science
may
come
and
consider
these
ways
and
find
that
most
of
them
are
useful
but
it
is
not
for
the
sake
of
their
utility
that
they
are
followed
but
because
at
the
moment
of
following
them
we
feel
that
that
is
the
only
appropriate
and
natural
thing
to
do
not
one
man
in
a
billion
when
taking
his
dinner
ever
thinks
of
utility
he
eats
because
the
food
tastes
good
and
makes
him
want
more
if
you
ask
him
he
should
want
to
eat
more
of
what
tastes
like
that
instead
of
revering
you
as
a
philosopher
he
will
probably
laugh
at
you
for
a
fool
the
connection
between
the
savory
sensation
and
the
act
it
awakens
is
for
him
absolute
and
an
synthesis
of
the
most
perfect
sort
needing
no
proof
but
its
own
evidence
it
takes
in
short
what
berkeley
calls
a
mind
debauched
by
learning
to
carry
the
process
of
making
the
natural
seem
strange
so
far
as
to
ask
for
the
of
any
instinctive
human
act
to
the
metaphysician
alone
can
such
questions
occur
as
why
do
we
smile
when
pleased
and
not
scowl
why
are
we
unable
to
talk
to
a
crowd
as
we
talk
to
a
single
friend
why
does
a
particular
maiden
turn
our
wits
so
the
common
man
can
only
say
we
smile
our
heart
palpitates
at
the
sight
of
the
crowd
we
love
the
maiden
that
beautiful
soul
clad
in
that
perfect
form
so
palpably
and
flagrantly
made
from
all
eternity
to
be
loved
and
so
probably
does
each
animal
feel
about
the
particular
things
it
tends
to
do
in
presence
of
particular
objects
they
too
are
syntheses
to
the
lion
it
is
the
lioness
which
is
made
to
be
loved
to
the
bear
the
to
the
broody
hen
the
notion
would
probably
seem
monstrous
that
there
should
be
a
creature
in
the
world
to
whom
a
nestful
of
eggs
was
not
the
utterly
fascinating
and
precious
and
object
which
it
is
to
her
thus
we
may
be
sure
that
however
mysterious
some
animals
instincts
may
appear
to
us
our
instincts
will
appear
no
less
mysterious
to
them
and
we
may
conclude
that
to
the
animal
which
obeys
it
every
impulse
and
every
step
of
every
instinct
shines
with
its
own
sufficient
light
and
seems
at
the
moment
the
only
eternally
right
and
proper
thing
to
do
it
is
done
for
its
own
sake
exclusively
what
voluptuous
thrill
may
not
shake
a
fly
when
she
at
last
discovers
the
one
particular
leaf
or
carrion
or
bit
of
dung
that
out
of
all
the
world
can
stimulate
her
ovipositor
to
its
discharge
does
not
the
discharge
then
seem
to
her
the
only
fitting
thing
and
need
she
care
or
know
anything
about
the
future
maggot
and
its
food
are
not
always
blind
or
nothing
is
commoner
than
the
remark
that
man
differs
from
lower
creatures
by
the
almost
total
absence
of
instincts
and
the
assumption
of
their
work
in
him
by
a
fruitless
discussion
might
be
waged
on
this
point
by
two
theorizers
who
were
careful
not
to
define
their
terms
we
must
of
course
avoid
a
quarrel
about
words
and
the
facts
of
the
case
are
really
tolerably
plain
man
has
a
far
greater
variety
of
than
any
lower
animal
and
any
one
of
these
impulses
taken
in
itself
is
as
as
the
lowest
instinct
can
be
but
owing
to
man
memory
power
of
reflection
and
power
of
inference
they
come
each
one
to
be
felt
by
him
after
he
has
once
yielded
to
them
and
experienced
their
results
in
connection
with
a
of
those
results
in
this
condition
an
impulse
acted
out
may
be
said
to
be
acted
out
in
part
at
least
the
of
its
results
it
is
obvious
that
instinctive
act
in
an
animal
with
memory
must
cease
to
be
after
being
once
and
must
be
accompanied
with
foresight
of
its
just
so
far
as
that
end
may
have
fallen
under
the
animal
cognizance
an
insect
that
lays
her
eggs
in
a
place
where
she
never
sees
them
hatched
must
always
do
so
but
a
hen
who
has
already
hatched
a
brood
can
hardly
be
assumed
to
sit
with
perfect
on
her
second
nest
some
expectation
of
consequences
must
in
every
case
like
this
be
aroused
and
this
expectation
according
as
it
is
that
of
something
desired
or
of
something
disliked
must
necessarily
either
or
inhibit
the
mere
impulse
the
hen
idea
of
the
chickens
would
probably
encourage
her
to
sit
a
rat
memory
on
the
other
hand
of
a
former
escape
from
a
trap
would
neutralize
his
impulse
to
take
bait
from
anything
that
reminded
him
of
that
trap
if
a
boy
sees
a
fat
he
probably
has
incontinently
an
impulse
especially
if
with
other
boys
to
smash
the
creature
with
a
stone
which
impulse
we
may
suppose
him
blindly
to
obey
but
something
in
the
expression
of
the
dying
toad
clasped
hands
suggests
the
meanness
of
the
act
or
reminds
him
of
sayings
he
has
heard
about
the
sufferings
of
animals
being
like
his
own
so
that
when
next
he
is
tempted
by
a
toad
an
idea
arises
which
far
from
spurring
him
again
to
the
torment
prompts
kindly
actions
and
may
even
make
him
the
toad
champion
against
less
reflecting
boys
it
is
plain
then
that
matter
how
well
endowed
an
animal
may
originally
be
in
the
way
of
instincts
his
resultant
actions
will
be
much
modified
if
the
instincts
combine
with
if
in
addition
to
impulses
he
have
memories
associations
inferences
and
expectations
on
any
considerable
scale
an
object
o
on
which
he
has
an
instinctive
impulse
to
react
in
the
manner
a
would
provoke
him
to
that
reaction
but
o
has
meantime
become
for
him
a
of
the
nearness
of
p
on
which
he
has
an
equally
strong
impulse
to
react
in
the
manner
b
quite
unlike
a
so
that
when
he
meets
o
the
immediate
impulse
a
and
the
remote
impulse
b
struggle
in
his
breast
for
the
mastery
the
fatality
and
uniformity
said
to
be
characteristic
of
instinctive
actions
will
be
so
little
manifest
that
one
might
be
tempted
to
deny
to
him
altogether
the
possession
of
any
instinct
about
the
object
o
yet
how
false
this
judgment
would
be
the
instinct
about
o
is
there
only
by
the
complication
of
the
associative
machinery
it
has
come
into
conflict
with
another
instinct
about
here
we
immediately
reap
the
good
fruits
of
our
simple
physiological
conception
of
what
an
instinct
is
if
it
be
a
mere
impulse
due
to
the
preÃ«xistence
of
a
certain
arc
in
the
of
the
creature
of
course
it
must
follow
the
law
of
all
such
reflex
arcs
one
liability
of
such
arcs
is
to
have
their
activity
by
other
processes
going
on
at
the
same
time
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
arc
be
organized
at
birth
or
ripen
spontaneously
later
or
be
due
to
acquired
habit
it
must
take
its
chances
with
all
the
other
arcs
and
sometimes
succeed
and
sometimes
fail
in
drafting
off
the
currents
through
itself
the
mystical
view
of
an
instinct
would
make
it
invariable
the
physiological
view
would
require
it
to
show
occasional
irregularities
in
any
animal
in
whom
the
number
of
separate
instincts
and
the
possible
entrance
of
the
same
stimulus
into
several
of
them
were
great
and
such
irregularities
are
what
every
superior
instincts
do
show
in
abundance
wherever
the
mind
is
elevated
enough
to
discriminate
wherever
several
distinct
sensory
elements
must
combine
to
discharge
the
reflex
arc
wherever
instead
of
plumping
into
action
instantly
at
the
first
rough
intimation
of
what
of
a
thing
is
there
the
agent
waits
to
see
which
of
its
kind
it
is
and
what
the
are
of
its
appearance
wherever
different
individuals
and
different
circumstances
can
impel
him
in
different
ways
wherever
these
are
the
conditions
we
have
a
masking
of
the
elementary
constitution
of
the
instinctive
life
the
whole
story
of
our
dealings
with
the
lower
wild
animals
is
the
history
of
our
taking
advantage
of
the
way
in
which
they
judge
of
everything
by
its
mere
label
as
it
were
so
as
to
ensnare
or
kill
them
nature
in
them
has
left
matters
in
this
rough
way
and
made
them
act
in
the
manner
which
would
be
right
there
are
more
worms
unattached
to
hooks
than
impaled
upon
them
therefore
on
the
whole
says
nature
to
her
fishy
children
bite
at
worm
and
take
your
chances
but
as
her
children
get
higher
and
their
lives
more
precious
she
reduces
the
risks
since
what
seems
to
be
the
same
object
may
be
now
a
genuine
food
and
now
a
bait
since
in
gregarious
species
each
individual
may
prove
to
be
either
the
friend
or
the
rival
according
to
the
circumstances
of
another
since
any
entirely
unknown
object
may
be
fraught
with
weal
or
woe
implants
contrary
impulses
to
act
on
many
classes
of
and
leaves
it
to
slight
alterations
in
the
conditions
of
the
individual
case
to
decide
which
impulse
shall
carry
the
day
thus
greediness
and
suspicion
curiosity
and
timidity
coyness
and
desire
bashfulness
and
vanity
sociability
and
pugnacity
seem
to
shoot
over
into
each
other
as
quickly
and
to
remain
in
as
unstable
an
equilibrium
in
the
higher
birds
and
mammals
as
in
man
all
are
impulses
congenital
blind
at
first
and
productive
of
motor
reactions
of
a
rigorously
determinate
sort
one
of
them
then
is
an
as
instincts
are
commonly
defined
they
contradict
each
in
each
particular
opportunity
of
application
usually
deciding
the
issue
animal
that
exhibits
them
loses
the
and
appears
to
lead
a
life
of
hesitation
and
choice
an
intellectual
life
however
because
he
has
no
instincts
rather
because
he
has
so
many
that
they
block
each
thus
we
may
confidently
say
that
however
uncertain
man
reactions
upon
his
environment
may
sometimes
seem
in
comparison
with
those
of
lower
mammals
the
uncertainty
is
probably
not
due
to
their
possession
of
any
principles
of
action
which
he
lacks
the
contrary
man
possesses
all
the
impulses
that
they
have
and
a
great
many
more
in
other
words
there
is
no
material
antagonism
between
instinct
and
reason
reason
can
inhibit
no
impulses
the
only
thing
that
can
neutralize
an
impulse
is
an
impulse
the
other
way
reason
may
however
make
an
which
will
excite
the
imagination
so
as
to
let
the
impulse
the
other
way
and
thus
though
the
animal
richest
in
reason
is
also
the
animal
richest
in
instinctive
impulses
too
he
never
seems
the
fatal
automaton
which
a
instinctive
animal
must
be
principles
of
instincts
may
be
masked
in
the
mature
animal
life
by
two
other
causes
these
are
the
of
instincts
by
and
the
of
the
law
of
of
instincts
by
is
this
objects
of
a
certain
class
elicit
from
an
animal
a
certain
sort
of
reaction
it
often
happens
that
the
animal
becomes
partial
to
the
first
specimen
of
the
class
on
which
it
has
reacted
and
will
not
afterward
react
on
any
other
the
selection
of
a
particular
hole
to
live
in
of
a
particular
mate
of
a
particular
a
particular
variety
of
diet
a
particular
anything
in
short
out
of
a
possible
multitude
is
a
very
tendency
among
animals
even
those
low
down
in
the
scale
the
limpet
will
return
to
the
same
in
its
rock
and
the
lobster
to
its
favorite
nook
on
the
the
rabbit
will
deposit
its
dung
in
the
same
corner
the
bird
makes
its
nest
on
the
same
bough
but
each
of
these
preferences
carries
with
it
an
insensibility
to
opportunities
and
occasions
an
insensibility
which
can
only
be
described
physiologically
as
an
inhibition
of
new
impulses
by
the
habit
of
old
ones
already
formed
the
possession
of
homes
and
wives
of
our
own
makes
us
strangely
insensible
to
the
charms
of
those
of
other
people
few
of
us
are
adventurous
in
the
matter
of
food
in
fact
most
of
us
think
there
is
something
disgusting
in
a
bill
of
fare
to
which
we
are
unused
strangers
we
are
apt
to
think
can
not
be
worth
knowing
especially
if
they
come
from
distant
cities
etc
the
original
impulse
which
got
us
homes
wives
dietaries
and
friends
at
all
seems
to
exhaust
itself
in
its
first
achievements
and
to
leave
no
surplus
energy
for
reacting
on
new
cases
and
so
it
comes
about
that
witnessing
this
torpor
an
observer
of
mankind
might
say
that
no
propensity
toward
certain
objects
existed
at
all
it
existed
but
it
existed
or
as
an
instinct
pure
and
simple
only
before
habit
was
formed
a
habit
once
grafted
on
an
instinctive
tendency
restricts
the
range
of
the
tendency
itself
and
keeps
us
from
reacting
on
any
but
the
habitual
object
although
other
objects
might
just
as
well
have
been
chosen
had
they
been
the
another
sort
of
arrest
of
instinct
by
habit
is
where
the
same
class
of
objects
awakens
contrary
instinctive
impulses
here
the
impulse
first
followed
toward
a
given
individual
of
the
class
is
apt
to
keep
him
from
ever
awakening
the
opposite
impulse
in
us
in
fact
the
whole
class
may
be
protected
by
this
individual
specimen
from
the
application
to
it
of
the
other
impulse
animals
for
example
awaken
in
a
child
the
opposite
impulses
of
fearing
and
fondling
but
if
a
child
in
his
first
attempts
to
pat
a
dog
gets
snapped
at
or
bitten
so
that
the
impulse
of
fear
is
strongly
aroused
it
may
be
that
for
years
to
come
no
dog
will
excite
in
him
the
impulse
to
fondle
again
on
the
other
hand
the
greatest
natural
enemies
if
carefully
introduced
to
each
other
when
young
and
guided
at
the
outset
by
superior
authority
settle
down
into
those
families
of
friends
which
we
see
in
our
menageries
young
animals
immediately
after
birth
have
no
instinct
of
fear
but
show
their
dependence
by
allowing
themselves
to
be
freely
handled
later
however
they
grow
and
if
left
to
themselves
will
not
let
man
approach
them
i
am
told
by
farmers
in
the
adirondack
wilderness
that
it
is
a
very
serious
matter
if
a
cow
wanders
off
and
calves
in
the
woods
and
is
not
found
for
a
week
or
more
the
calf
by
that
time
is
as
wild
and
almost
as
fleet
as
a
deer
and
hard
to
capture
without
violence
but
calves
rarely
show
any
wildness
to
the
men
who
have
been
in
contact
with
them
during
the
first
days
of
their
life
when
the
instinct
to
attach
themselves
is
uppermost
nor
do
they
dread
strangers
as
they
would
if
brought
up
wild
chickens
give
a
curious
illustration
of
the
same
law
wonderful
article
on
instinct
shall
supply
us
with
the
facts
these
little
creatures
show
opposite
instincts
of
attachment
and
fear
either
of
which
may
be
aroused
by
the
same
object
man
if
a
chick
is
born
in
the
absence
of
the
hen
it
will
follow
any
moving
object
and
when
guided
by
sight
alone
they
seem
to
have
no
more
disposition
to
follow
a
hen
than
to
follow
a
duck
or
a
human
being
unreflecting
when
they
saw
chickens
a
day
old
running
after
me
says
spalding
and
older
ones
following
me
for
miles
and
answering
to
my
whistle
imagined
that
i
must
have
some
occult
power
over
the
creatures
whereas
i
had
simply
allowed
them
to
follow
me
from
the
first
there
is
the
instinct
to
follow
and
the
ear
prior
to
experience
attaches
them
to
the
right
object
but
if
a
man
presents
himself
for
the
first
time
when
the
instinct
of
is
strong
the
phenomena
are
altogether
reversed
spalding
kept
three
chickens
hooded
until
they
were
nearly
four
days
old
and
thus
describes
their
behavior
each
of
them
on
being
unhooded
evinced
the
greatest
terror
to
me
dashing
off
in
the
opposite
direction
whenever
i
sought
to
approach
it
the
table
on
which
they
were
unhooded
stood
before
a
window
and
each
in
its
turn
beat
against
the
window
like
a
wild
bird
one
of
them
darted
behind
some
books
and
squeezing
itself
into
a
corner
remained
cowering
for
a
length
of
time
we
might
guess
at
the
meaning
of
this
strange
and
exceptional
wildness
but
the
odd
fact
is
enough
for
my
present
purpose
whatever
might
have
been
the
meaning
of
this
marked
change
in
their
mental
constitution
had
they
been
unhooded
on
the
previous
day
they
would
have
run
to
me
instead
of
from
me
it
could
not
have
been
the
effect
of
experience
it
must
have
resulted
wholly
from
changes
in
their
own
organizations
their
case
was
precisely
analogous
to
that
of
the
adirondack
calves
the
two
opposite
instincts
relative
to
the
same
object
ripen
in
succession
if
the
first
one
engenders
a
habit
that
habit
will
inhibit
the
application
of
the
second
instinct
to
that
object
all
animals
are
tame
during
the
earliest
phase
of
their
infancy
habits
formed
then
limit
the
effects
of
whatever
instincts
of
wildness
may
later
be
evolved
this
leads
us
to
the
of
which
is
this
instincts
ripen
at
a
certain
age
and
then
fade
a
consequence
of
this
law
is
that
if
during
the
time
of
such
an
instinct
vivacity
objects
adequate
to
arouse
it
are
met
with
a
of
acting
on
them
is
formed
which
remains
when
the
original
instinct
has
passed
away
but
that
if
no
such
objects
are
met
with
then
no
habit
will
be
formed
and
later
on
in
life
when
the
animal
meets
the
objects
he
will
altogether
fail
to
react
as
at
the
earlier
epoch
he
would
instinctively
have
done
no
doubt
such
a
law
is
restricted
some
instincts
are
far
less
transient
than
others
those
connected
with
feeding
and
may
hardly
be
transient
at
all
and
some
after
fading
out
for
a
time
recur
as
strong
as
ever
the
instincts
of
pairing
and
rearing
young
the
law
however
though
not
absolute
is
certainly
very
widespread
and
a
few
examples
will
illustrate
just
what
it
means
in
the
chickens
and
calves
above
mentioned
it
is
obvious
that
the
instinct
to
follow
and
become
attached
fades
out
after
a
few
days
and
that
the
instinct
of
flight
then
take
its
place
the
conduct
of
the
creature
toward
man
being
decided
by
the
formation
or
of
a
certain
habit
during
those
days
the
transiency
of
the
instinct
to
follow
is
also
proved
by
its
conduct
toward
the
hen
spalding
kept
some
chickens
shut
up
till
they
were
comparatively
old
and
speaking
of
these
he
says
a
chicken
that
has
not
heard
the
call
of
the
mother
until
eight
or
ten
days
old
then
hears
it
as
if
it
heard
it
not
i
regret
to
find
that
on
this
point
my
notes
are
not
so
full
as
i
could
wish
or
as
they
might
have
been
there
is
however
an
account
of
one
chicken
that
could
not
be
returned
to
the
mother
when
ten
days
old
the
hen
followed
it
and
tried
to
entice
it
in
every
way
still
it
continually
left
her
and
ran
to
the
house
or
to
any
person
of
whom
it
caught
sight
this
it
persisted
in
doing
though
beaten
back
with
a
small
branch
dozens
of
times
and
indeed
cruelly
maltreated
it
was
also
placed
under
the
mother
at
night
but
it
again
left
her
in
the
morning
the
instinct
of
sucking
is
ripe
in
all
mammals
at
birth
and
leads
to
that
habit
of
taking
the
breast
which
in
the
human
infant
may
be
prolonged
by
daily
exercise
long
beyond
its
usual
term
of
a
year
or
a
year
and
a
half
but
the
instinct
itself
is
transient
in
the
sense
that
if
for
any
reason
the
child
be
fed
by
spoon
during
the
first
few
days
of
its
life
and
not
put
to
the
breast
it
may
be
no
easy
matter
after
that
to
make
it
suck
at
all
so
of
calves
if
their
mother
die
or
be
dry
or
refuse
to
let
them
suck
for
a
day
or
two
so
that
they
are
fed
by
hand
it
becomes
hard
to
get
them
to
suck
at
all
when
a
new
nurse
is
provided
the
ease
with
which
sucking
creatures
are
weaned
by
simply
breaking
the
habit
and
giving
them
food
in
a
new
way
shows
that
the
instinct
purely
as
such
must
be
entirely
extinct
assuredly
the
simple
fact
that
instincts
are
transient
and
that
the
effect
of
later
ones
may
be
altered
by
the
habits
which
earlier
ones
have
left
behind
is
a
far
more
philosophical
explanation
than
the
notion
of
an
instinctive
constitution
vaguely
or
out
of
gear
i
have
observed
a
scotch
terrier
born
on
the
floor
of
a
stable
in
december
and
transferred
six
weeks
later
to
a
carpeted
house
make
when
he
was
less
than
four
months
old
a
very
elaborate
pretence
of
burying
things
such
as
gloves
with
which
he
had
played
till
he
was
tired
he
scratched
the
carpet
with
his
forefeet
dropped
the
object
from
his
mouth
upon
the
spot
then
scratched
all
about
it
and
finally
went
away
and
let
it
lie
of
course
the
act
was
entirely
useless
i
saw
him
perform
it
at
that
age
some
four
or
five
times
and
never
again
in
his
life
the
conditions
were
not
present
to
fix
a
habit
which
should
last
when
the
prompting
instinct
died
away
but
suppose
meat
instead
of
a
glove
earth
instead
of
a
carpet
instead
of
a
fresh
supper
a
few
hours
later
and
it
is
easy
to
see
how
this
dog
might
have
got
into
a
habit
of
burying
superfluous
food
which
might
have
lasted
all
his
life
who
can
swear
that
the
strictly
instinctive
part
of
the
propensity
in
the
wild
may
not
be
as
as
it
was
in
this
terrier
leaving
lower
animals
aside
and
turning
to
human
instincts
we
see
the
law
of
transiency
corroborated
on
the
widest
scale
by
the
alternation
of
different
interests
and
passions
as
human
life
goes
on
with
the
child
life
is
all
play
and
and
learning
the
external
properties
of
with
the
youth
it
is
bodily
exercises
of
a
more
systematic
sort
novels
of
the
real
world
and
song
friendship
and
love
nature
travel
and
adventure
science
and
philosophy
with
the
man
ambition
and
policy
acquisitiveness
responsibility
to
others
and
the
selfish
zest
of
the
battle
of
life
if
a
boy
grows
up
alone
at
the
age
of
games
and
sports
and
learns
neither
to
play
ball
nor
row
nor
sail
nor
ride
nor
skate
nor
fish
nor
shoot
probably
he
will
be
sedentary
to
the
end
of
his
days
and
though
the
best
of
opportunities
be
afforded
him
for
learning
these
things
later
it
is
a
hundred
to
one
but
he
will
pass
them
by
and
shrink
back
from
the
effort
of
taking
those
necessary
first
steps
the
prospect
of
which
at
an
earlier
age
would
have
filled
him
with
eager
delight
the
sexual
passion
expires
after
a
protracted
reign
but
it
is
well
known
that
its
peculiar
manifestations
in
a
given
individual
depend
almost
entirely
on
the
habits
he
may
form
during
the
early
period
of
its
activity
exposure
to
bad
company
then
makes
him
a
loose
liver
all
his
days
chastity
kept
at
first
makes
the
same
easy
later
on
in
all
pedagogy
the
great
thing
is
to
strike
the
iron
while
hot
and
to
seize
the
wave
of
the
pupil
interest
in
each
successive
subject
before
its
ebb
has
come
so
that
knowledge
may
be
got
and
a
habit
of
skill
acquired
a
headway
of
interest
in
short
secured
on
which
afterward
the
individual
may
float
there
is
a
happy
moment
for
fixing
skill
in
drawing
for
making
boys
collectors
in
natural
history
and
presently
dissectors
and
botanists
then
for
initiating
them
into
the
harmonies
of
mechanics
and
the
wonders
of
physical
and
chemical
law
later
introspective
psychology
and
the
metaphysical
and
religious
mysteries
take
their
turn
and
last
of
all
the
drama
of
human
affairs
and
worldly
wisdom
in
the
widest
sense
of
the
term
in
each
of
us
a
is
soon
reached
in
all
these
things
the
impetus
of
our
purely
intellectual
zeal
expires
and
unless
the
topic
be
one
associated
with
some
urgent
personal
need
that
keeps
our
wits
constantly
whetted
about
it
we
settle
into
an
equilibrium
and
live
on
what
we
learned
when
our
interest
was
fresh
and
instinctive
without
adding
to
the
store
outside
of
their
own
business
the
ideas
gained
by
men
before
they
are
are
practically
the
only
ideas
they
shall
have
in
their
lives
they
get
anything
new
disinterested
curiosity
is
past
the
mental
grooves
and
channels
set
the
power
of
assimilation
gone
if
by
chance
we
ever
do
learn
anything
about
some
entirely
new
topic
we
are
afflicted
with
a
strange
sense
of
insecurity
and
we
fear
to
advance
a
resolute
opinion
but
with
things
learned
in
the
plastic
days
of
instinctive
curiosity
we
never
lose
entirely
our
sense
of
being
at
home
there
remains
a
kinship
a
sentiment
of
intimate
acquaintance
which
even
when
we
know
we
have
failed
to
keep
abreast
of
the
subject
flatters
us
with
a
sense
of
power
over
it
and
makes
us
feel
not
altogether
out
of
the
pale
whatever
individual
exceptions
to
this
might
be
cited
are
of
the
sort
that
the
rule
to
detect
the
moment
of
the
instinctive
readiness
for
the
subject
is
then
the
first
duty
of
every
educator
as
for
the
pupils
it
would
probably
lead
to
a
more
earnest
temper
on
the
part
of
college
students
if
they
had
less
belief
in
their
unlimited
future
intellectual
potentialities
and
could
be
brought
to
realize
that
whatever
physics
and
political
economy
and
philosophy
they
are
now
acquiring
are
for
better
or
worse
the
physics
and
political
economy
and
philosophy
that
will
have
to
serve
them
to
the
end
of
instincts
in
professor
preyer
in
his
careful
little
work
seele
des
kindes
says
instinctive
acts
are
in
man
few
in
number
and
apart
from
those
connected
with
the
sexual
passion
difficult
to
recognize
after
early
youth
is
past
and
he
adds
so
much
the
more
attention
should
we
pay
to
the
instinctive
movements
of
babies
sucklings
and
small
children
that
instinctive
acts
should
be
easiest
in
childhood
would
be
a
very
natural
effect
of
our
principles
of
transitoriness
and
of
the
restrictive
influence
of
habits
once
acquired
but
they
are
far
indeed
from
being
in
number
in
man
professor
preyer
divides
the
movements
of
infants
into
and
by
impulsive
movements
he
means
movements
of
limbs
body
and
voice
with
no
aim
and
before
perception
is
aroused
among
the
first
reflex
movements
are
crying
on
contact
with
the
air
snuffling
snoring
coughing
sighing
sobbing
gagging
vomiting
hiccuping
starting
moving
the
limbs
when
touched
and
to
these
may
now
be
added
by
the
see
later
on
come
and
them
to
the
and
it
is
probable
that
the
centres
for
executing
these
three
latter
acts
ripen
spontaneously
just
as
those
for
flight
have
been
proved
to
do
in
birds
and
that
the
appearance
of
to
stand
and
walk
by
trial
and
failure
is
due
to
the
exercise
beginning
in
most
children
before
the
centres
are
ripe
children

enormously
in
the
rate
and
manner
in
which
they

to

with
in
its
train
of
definite
objects

in

much
later
though
on
the
instinct

emotion

so
much
in
human
life
depends
and
all
begin
very
early
in
life
the
the
come
later
by
the
age

or
the
whole
array
of
human
instincts

complete
it
will
be
observed
that
other
mammal
not
even
the
monkey
shows
so
large
a

a
development
every
one
of
these
instincts
would
start
a
habit
toward
certain
objects
and
inhibit
a
habit
towards
certain
others
usually
this
is
the
case
but
in
the
development
of
civilized
life
it
happens
that
the
timely
age
goes
by
in
a
sort
of
starvation
of
objects
and
the
individual
then
grows
up
with
gaps
in
his
psychic
constitution
which
future
experiences
can
never
fill
compare
the
accomplished
gentleman
with
the
poor
artisan
or
tradesman
of
a
city
during
the
adolescence
of
the
former
objects
appropriate
to
his
growing
interests
bodily
and
mental
were
offered
as
fast
as
the
interests
awoke
and
as
a
consequence
he
is
armed
and
equipped
at
every
angle
to
meet
the
world
sport
came
to
the
rescue
and
completed
his
education
where
real
things
were
lacking
he
has
tasted
of
the
essence
of
every
side
of
human
life
being
sailor
hunter
athlete
scholar
fighter
talker
dandy
man
of
affairs
all
in
one
over
the
city
poor
boy
youth
no
such
golden
opportunities
were
hung
and
in
his
manhood
no
desires
for
most
of
them
exist
fortunate
it
is
for
him
if
gaps
are
the
only
anomalies
his
instinctive
life
presents
perversions
are
too
often
the
fruit
of
his
unnatural
of
in
order
to
treat
at
least
one
instinct
at
greater
length
i
will
take
the
instance
of
fear
is
a
reaction
aroused
by
the
same
objects
that
arouse
ferocity
the
antagonism
of
the
two
is
an
interesting
study
in
instinctive
dynamics
we
both
fear
and
wish
to
kill
anything
that
may
kill
us
and
the
question
which
of
the
two
impulses
we
shall
follow
is
usually
decided
by
some
one
of
those
collateral
circumstances
of
the
particular
case
to
be
moved
by
which
is
the
mark
of
superior
mental
natures
of
course
this
introduces
uncertainty
into
the
reaction
but
it
is
an
uncertainty
found
in
the
higher
brutes
as
well
as
in
men
and
ought
not
to
be
taken
as
proof
that
we
are
less
instinctive
than
they
fear
has
bodily
expressions
of
an
extremely
energetic
kind
and
stands
beside
lust
and
anger
as
one
of
the
three
most
exciting
emotions
of
which
our
nature
is
susceptible
the
progress
from
brute
to
man
is
characterized
by
nothing
so
much
as
by
the
decrease
in
frequency
of
proper
occasions
for
fear
in
civilized
life
in
particular
it
has
at
last
become
possible
for
large
numbers
of
people
to
pass
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
without
ever
having
had
a
pang
of
genuine
fear
many
of
us
need
an
attack
of
mental
disease
to
teach
us
the
meaning
of
the
word
hence
the
possibility
of
so
much
blindly
optimistic
philosophy
and
religion
the
atrocities
of
life
become
a
tale
of
little
meaning
though
the
words
are
strong
we
doubt
if
anything
like
ever
really
was
within
the
tiger
jaws
and
conclude
that
the
horrors
we
hear
of
are
but
a
sort
of
painted
tapestry
for
the
chambers
in
which
we
lie
so
comfortably
at
peace
with
ourselves
and
with
the
world
be
this
as
it
may
fear
is
a
genuine
instinct
and
one
of
the
earliest
shown
by
the
human
child
seem
especially
to
call
it
forth
most
noises
from
the
outer
world
to
a
child
bred
in
the
house
have
no
exact
significance
they
are
simply
startling
to
quote
a
good
observer
perez
children
between
three
and
ten
months
are
less
often
alarmed
by
visual
than
by
auditory
impressions
in
cats
from
the
fifteenth
day
the
contrary
is
the
case
a
child
three
and
a
half
months
old
in
the
midst
of
the
turmoil
of
a
conflagration
in
presence
of
the
devouring
flames
and
ruined
walls
showed
neither
astonishment
nor
fear
but
smiled
at
the
woman
who
was
taking
care
of
him
while
his
parents
were
busy
the
noise
however
of
the
trumpet
of
the
firemen
who
were
approaching
and
that
of
the
wheels
of
the
engine
made
him
start
and
cry
at
this
age
i
have
never
yet
seen
an
infant
startled
at
a
flash
of
lightning
even
when
intense
but
i
have
seen
many
of
them
alarmed
at
the
voice
of
the
thunder
thus
fear
comes
rather
by
the
ears
than
by
the
eyes
to
the
child
without
experience
the
effect
of
noise
in
heightening
any
terror
we
may
feel
in
adult
years
is
very
marked
the
of
the
storm
whether
on
sea
or
land
is
a
principal
cause
of
our
anxiety
when
exposed
to
it
the
writer
has
been
interested
in
noticing
in
his
own
person
while
lying
in
bed
and
kept
awake
by
the
wind
outside
how
invariably
each
loud
gust
of
it
arrested
momentarily
his
heart
a
dog
attacking
us
is
much
more
dreadful
by
reason
of
the
noises
he
makes
and
either
large
or
small
excite
fear
but
especially
men
or
animals
advancing
toward
us
in
a
threatening
way
this
is
entirely
instinctive
and
antecedent
to
experience
some
children
will
cry
with
terror
at
their
very
first
sight
of
a
cat
or
dog
and
it
will
often
be
impossible
for
weeks
to
make
them
touch
it
others
will
wish
to
fondle
it
almost
immediately
certain
kinds
of
especially
spiders
and
snakes
seem
to
excite
a
fear
unusually
difficult
to
overcome
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
much
of
this
difference
is
instinctive
and
how
much
the
result
of
stories
heard
about
these
creatures
that
the
fear
of
ripens
gradually
seemed
to
me
to
be
proved
in
a
child
of
my
own
to
whom
i
gave
a
live
frog
once
at
the
age
of
six
to
eight
months
and
again
when
he
was
a
year
and
a
half
old
the
first
time
he
seized
it
promptly
and
holding
it
in
spite
of
its
struggling
at
last
got
its
head
into
his
mouth
he
then
let
it
crawl
up
his
breast
and
get
upon
his
face
without
showing
alarm
but
the
second
time
although
he
had
seen
no
frog
and
heard
no
story
about
a
frog
betweenwhiles
it
was
almost
impossible
to
induce
him
to
touch
it
another
child
a
year
old
eagerly
took
some
very
large
spiders
into
his
hand
at
present
he
is
afraid
but
has
been
exposed
meanwhile
to
the
teachings
of
the
nursery
one
of
my
children
from
her
birth
upwards
saw
daily
the
pet
of
the
house
and
never
betrayed
the
slightest
fear
until
she
was
if
i
recollect
rightly
about
eight
months
old
then
the
instinct
suddenly
seemed
to
develop
and
with
such
intensity
that
familiarity
had
no
mitigating
effect
she
screamed
whenever
the
dog
entered
the
room
and
for
many
months
remained
afraid
to
touch
him
it
is
needless
to
say
that
no
change
in
the
pug
unfailingly
friendly
conduct
had
anything
to
do
with
this
change
of
feeling
in
the
child
two
of
my
children
were
afraid
when
babies
of
richet
reports
a
similar
observation
preyer
tells
of
a
young
child
screaming
with
fear
on
being
carried
near
to
the
the
great
source
of
terror
to
infancy
is
solitude
the
teleology
of
this
is
obvious
as
is
also
that
of
the
infant
expression
of
dismay
the
cry
on
waking
up
and
finding
himself
alone
and
especially
holes
caverns
arouse
a
peculiarly
gruesome
fear
this
fear
as
well
as
that
of
solitude
of
being
are
explained
after
a
fashion
by
ancestral
experience
says
schneider
it
is
a
fact
that
men
especially
in
childhood
fear
to
go
into
a
dark
cavern
or
a
gloomy
wood
this
feeling
of
fear
arises
to
be
sure
partly
from
the
fact
that
we
easily
suspect
that
dangerous
beasts
may
lurk
in
these
localities
a
suspicion
due
to
stories
we
have
heard
and
read
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
quite
sure
that
this
fear
at
a
certain
perception
is
also
directly
inherited
children
who
have
been
carefully
guarded
from
all
are
nevertheless
terrified
and
cry
if
led
into
a
dark
place
especially
if
sounds
are
made
there
even
an
adult
can
easily
observe
that
an
uncomfortable
timidity
steals
over
him
in
a
lonely
wood
at
night
although
he
may
have
the
fixed
conviction
that
not
the
slightest
danger
is
near
this
feeling
of
fear
occurs
in
many
men
even
in
their
own
house
after
dark
although
it
is
much
stronger
in
a
dark
cavern
or
forest
the
fact
of
such
instinctive
fear
is
easily
explicable
when
we
consider
that
our
savage
ancestors
through
innumerable
generations
were
accustomed
to
meet
with
dangerous
beasts
in
caverns
especially
bears
and
were
for
the
most
part
attacked
by
such
beasts
during
the
night
and
in
the
woods
and
that
thus
an
inseparable
association
between
the
perceptions
of
darkness
caverns
woods
and
fear
took
place
and
was
inherited
cause
fear
of
a
peculiarly
sickening
sort
though
here
again
individuals
differ
enormously
the
utterly
blind
instinctive
character
of
the
motor
impulses
here
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
they
are
almost
always
entirely
unreasonable
but
that
reason
is
powerless
to
suppress
them
that
they
are
a
mere
incidental
peculiarity
of
the
nervous
system
like
liability
to
or
love
of
music
with
no
teleological
significance
seems
more
than
probable
the
fear
in
question
varies
so
much
from
one
person
to
another
and
its
detrimental
effects
are
so
much
more
obvious
than
its
uses
that
it
is
hard
to
see
how
it
could
be
a
selected
instinct
man
is
anatomically
one
of
the
best
fitted
of
animals
for
climbing
about
high
places
the
best
psychical
complement
to
this
equipment
would
seem
to
be
a
head
when
there
not
a
dread
of
going
there
at
all
in
fact
the
teleology
of
fear
beyond
a
certain
point
is
more
than
dubious
a
certain
amount
of
timidity
obviously
adapts
us
to
the
world
we
live
in
but
the
is
surely
altogether
harmful
to
him
who
is
its
prey
fear
of
the
supernatural
is
one
variety
of
fear
it
is
difficult
to
assign
any
normal
object
for
this
fear
unless
it
were
a
genuine
ghost
but
in
spite
of
societies
science
has
not
yet
adopted
ghosts
so
we
can
only
say
that
certain
of
supernatural
agency
associated
with
real
circumstances
produce
a
peculiar
kind
of
horror
this
horror
is
probably
explicable
as
the
result
of
a
combination
of
simpler
horrors
to
bring
the
ghostly
terror
to
its
maximum
many
usual
elements
of
the
dreadful
must
combine
such
as
loneliness
darkness
inexplicable
sounds
especially
of
a
dismal
character
moving
figures
half
discerned
or
if
discerned
of
dreadful
aspect
and
a
vertiginous
baffling
of
the
expectation
this
last
element
which
is
is
very
important
it
produces
a
strange
emotional
in
our
blood
to
see
a
process
with
which
we
are
familiar
deliberately
taking
an
unwonted
course
anyone
heart
would
stop
beating
if
he
perceived
his
chair
sliding
unassisted
across
the
floor
the
lower
animals
appear
to
be
sensitive
to
the
mysteriously
exceptional
as
well
as
ourselves
my
friend
professor
brooks
told
me
of
his
large
and
noble
dog
being
frightened
into
a
sort
of
epileptic
fit
by
a
bone
being
drawn
across
the
floor
by
a
thread
which
the
dog
did
not
see
darwin
and
romanes
have
given
similar
experiences
the
idea
of
the
supernatural
involves
that
the
usual
should
be
set
at
naught
in
the
witch
and
hobgoblin
supernatural
other
elements
still
of
fear
are
brought
in
caverns
slime
and
ooze
vermin
corpses
and
the
like
a
human
corpse
seems
normally
to
produce
an
instinctive
dread
which
is
no
doubt
somewhat
due
to
its
mysteriousness
and
which
familiarity
rapidly
dispels
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
cadaveric
reptilian
and
underground
horrors
play
so
specific
and
constant
a
part
in
many
nightmares
and
forms
of
delirium
it
seems
not
altogether
unwise
to
ask
whether
these
forms
of
dreadful
circumstance
may
not
at
a
former
period
have
been
more
normal
objects
of
the
environment
than
now
the
ordinary
evolutionist
ought
to
have
no
difficulty
in
explaining
these
terrors
and
the
scenery
that
provokes
them
as
relapses
into
the
consciousness
of
the
a
consciousness
usually
overlaid
in
us
by
experiences
of
more
recent
date
there
are
certain
other
pathological
fears
and
certain
peculiarities
in
the
expression
of
ordinary
fear
which
might
receive
an
explanatory
light
from
ancestral
conditions
even
ones
in
ordinary
fear
one
may
either
run
or
remain
the
latter
condition
reminds
us
of
the
instinct
shown
by
many
animals
lindsay
in
his
work
in
animals
says
this
must
require
great
in
those
that
practise
it
but
it
is
really
no
feigning
of
death
at
all
and
requires
no
it
is
simply
a
which
has
been
so
useful
as
to
become
hereditary
the
beast
of
prey
does
not
think
the
motionless
bird
insect
or
crustacean
dead
he
simply
fails
to
notice
them
at
all
because
his
senses
like
ours
are
much
more
strongly
excited
by
a
moving
object
than
by
a
still
one
it
is
the
same
instinct
which
leads
a
boy
playing
spy
to
hold
his
very
breath
when
the
seeker
is
near
and
which
makes
the
beast
of
prey
himself
in
many
cases
motionlessly
lie
in
wait
for
his
victim
or
silently
it
by
stealthy
advances
alternated
with
periods
of
immobility
it
is
the
opposite
of
the
instinct
which
makes
us
jump
up
and
down
and
move
our
arms
when
we
wish
to
attract
the
notice
of
someone
passing
far
away
and
makes
the
shipwrecked
sailor
upon
the
raft
where
he
is
floating
frantically
wave
a
cloth
when
a
distant
sail
appears
now
may
not
the
crouching
immobility
of
some
melancholiacs
insane
with
general
anxiety
and
fear
of
everything
be
in
some
way
connected
with
this
old
instinct
they
can
give
no
for
their
fear
to
move
but
immobility
makes
them
feel
safer
and
more
comfortable
is
not
this
the
mental
state
of
the
animal
again
take
the
strange
symptom
which
has
been
described
of
late
years
by
the
rather
absurd
name
of
the
patient
is
seized
with
palpitation
and
terror
at
the
sight
of
any
open
place
or
broad
street
which
he
has
to
cross
alone
he
trembles
his
knees
bend
he
may
even
faint
at
the
idea
where
he
has
sufficient
he
sometimes
accomplishes
the
object
by
keeping
safe
under
the
lee
of
a
vehicle
going
across
or
joining
himself
to
a
knot
of
other
people
but
usually
he
slinks
round
the
sides
of
the
square
hugging
the
houses
as
closely
as
he
can
this
emotion
has
no
utility
in
a
civilized
man
but
when
we
notice
the
chronic
agoraphobia
of
our
domestic
cats
and
see
the
tenacious
way
in
which
many
wild
animals
especially
rodents
cling
to
cover
and
only
venture
on
a
dash
across
the
open
as
a
desperate
measure
even
then
making
for
every
stone
or
bunch
of
weeds
which
may
give
a
momentary
shelter
when
we
see
this
we
are
strongly
tempted
to
ask
whether
such
an
odd
kind
of
fear
in
us
be
not
due
to
the
accidental
resurrection
through
disease
of
a
sort
of
instinct
which
may
in
some
of
our
remote
ancestors
have
had
a
permanent
and
on
the
whole
a
useful
part
to
play
chapter
xxvi

of

which
everyone

and
which

power
we
that
the
desired
feeling
having
or
doing
shall
be
real
and
real
it
presently
becomes
either
immediately
upon
the
willing
or
after
certain
preliminaries
have
been
fulfilled
the
only
ends
which
follow
upon
our
willing
seem
to
be
movements
of
our
own
bodies
whatever
and
we
may
will
to
get
come
in
as
results
of
preliminary
movements
which
we
make
for
the
purpose
this
fact
is
too
familiar
to
need
illustration
so
that
we
may
start
with
the
proposition
that
the
only
outward
effects
of
our
will
are
bodily
movements
the
mechanism
of
production
of
these
voluntary
movements
is
what
befalls
us
to
study
now
are
secondary
the
movements
we
have
studied
hitherto
have
been
automatic
and
reflex
and
on
the
first
occasion
of
their
performance
at
any
rate
unforeseen
by
the
agent
the
movements
to
the
study
of
which
we
now
address
ourselves
being
desired
and
intended
beforehand
are
of
course
done
with
full
prevision
of
what
they
are
to
be
it
follows
from
this
that
movements
must
be
secondary
not
primary
functions
of
our
this
is
the
first
point
to
understand
in
the
psychology
of
volition
reflex
instinctive
and
emotional
movements
are
all
primary
performances
the
are
so
organized
that
certain
stimuli
pull
the
trigger
of
certain
explosive
parts
and
a
creature
going
through
one
of
these
explosions
for
the
first
time
undergoes
an
entirely
novel
experience
the
other
day
i
was
standing
at
a
railroad
station
with
a
little
child
when
an
went
thundering
by
the
child
who
was
near
the
edge
of
the
platform
started
winked
had
his
breathing
convulsed
turned
pale
burst
out
crying
and
ran
frantically
towards
me
and
hid
his
face
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
youngster
was
almost
as
much
astonished
by
his
own
behavior
as
he
was
by
the
train
and
more
than
i
was
who
stood
by
of
course
if
such
a
reaction
has
many
times
occurred
we
learn
what
to
expect
of
ourselves
and
can
then
foresee
our
conduct
even
though
it
remain
as
involuntary
and
uncontrollable
as
it
was
before
but
if
in
voluntary
action
properly
so
called
the
act
must
be
foreseen
it
follows
that
no
creature
not
endowed
with
prophetic
power
can
perform
an
act
voluntarily
for
the
first
time
well
we
are
no
more
endowed
with
prophetic
vision
of
what
movements
lie
in
our
power
than
we
are
endowed
with
prophetic
vision
of
what
sensations
we
are
capable
of
receiving
as
we
must
wait
for
the
sensations
to
be
given
us
so
we
must
wait
for
the
movements
to
be
performed
involuntarily
before
we
can
frame
ideas
of
what
either
of
these
things
are
we
learn
all
our
possibilities
by
the
way
of
experience
when
a
particular
movement
having
once
occurred
in
a
random
reflex
or
involuntary
way
has
left
an
image
of
itself
in
the
memory
then
the
movement
can
be
desired
again
and
deliberately
willed
but
it
is
impossible
to
see
how
it
could
be
willed
before
supply
of
ideas
of
the
various
movements
that
are
possible
left
in
the
memory
by
experiences
of
their
involuntary
performance
is
thus
the
first
prerequisite
of
the
voluntary
kinds
of
ideas
of
now
these
ideas
may
be
either
or
that
is
they
may
be
of
the
movement
as
it
feels
when
taking
place
in
the
moving
parts
or
they
may
be
of
the
movement
as
it
feels
in
some
other
part
of
the
body
which
it
affects
strokes
presses
scratches
etc
or
as
it
sounds
or
as
it
looks
the
resident
sensations
in
the
parts
that
move
have
been
called
feelings
the
memories
of
them
are
kinÃ¦sthetic
ideas
it
is
by
these
kinÃ¦sthetic
sensations
that
we
are
made
conscious
of
movements
communicated
to
our
limbs
by
others
if
you
lie
with
closed
eyes
and
another
person
noiselessly
places
your
arm
or
leg
in
any
arbitrarily
chosen
attitude
you
receive
a
feeling
of
what
attitude
it
is
and
can
reproduce
it
yourself
in
the
arm
or
leg
of
the
opposite
side
similarly
a
man
waked
suddenly
from
sleep
in
the
dark
is
aware
of
how
he
finds
himself
lying
at
least
this
is
what
happens
in
normal
cases
but
when
the
feelings
of
passive
movement
as
well
as
all
the
other
feelings
of
a
limb
are
lost
we
get
such
results
as
are
given
in
the
following
account
by
strÃ¼mpell
of
his
wonderful
anÃ¦sthetic
boy
whose
only
sources
of
feeling
were
the
right
eye
and
the
left
ear
passive
movements
could
be
imprinted
on
all
the
extremities
to
the
greatest
extent
without
attracting
the
patient
notice
only
in
violent
forced
hyperextension
of
the
joints
especially
of
the
knees
there
arose
a
dull
vague
feeling
of
strain
but
this
was
seldom
precisely
localized
we
have
often
after
bandaging
the
eyes
of
the
patient
carried
him
about
the
room
laid
him
on
a
table
given
to
his
arms
and
legs
the
most
fantastic
and
apparently
the
most
inconvenient
attitudes
without
his
having
a
suspicion
of
it
the
expression
of
astonishment
in
his
face
when
all
at
once
the
removal
of
the
handkerchief
revealed
his
situation
is
indescribable
in
words
only
when
his
head
was
made
to
hang
away
down
he
immediately
spoke
of
dizziness
but
could
not
assign
its
ground
later
he
sometimes
inferred
from
the
sounds
connected
with
the
manipulation
that
something
special
was
being
done
with
him
he
had
no
feelings
of
muscular
fatigue
if
with
his
eyes
shut
we
told
him
to
raise
his
arm
and
to
keep
it
up
he
did
so
without
trouble
after
one
or
two
minutes
however
the
arm
began
to
tremble
and
sink
without
his
being
aware
of
it
he
asserted
still
his
ability
to
keep
it
up
passively
holding
still
his
fingers
did
not
affect
him
he
thought
constantly
that
he
opened
and
shut
his
hand
whereas
it
was
really
fixed
third
kind
of
idea
is
called
we
need
then
when
we
perform
a
movement
either
a
kinÃ¦sthetic
or
a
remote
idea
of
which
special
movement
it
is
to
be
in
addition
to
this
it
has
often
been
supposed
that
we
need
an
of
the
amount
of
required
for
the
muscular
contraction
the
discharge
from
the
motor
centre
into
the
motor
nerve
is
supposed
to
give
a
sensation
opposed
to
all
our
other
sensations
these
accompany
incoming
currents
whilst
that
it
is
said
accompanies
an
outgoing
current
and
no
movement
is
supposed
to
be
totally
defined
in
our
mind
unless
an
anticipation
of
this
feeling
enter
into
our
idea
the
movement
degree
of
strength
and
the
effort
required
to
perform
it
are
supposed
to
be
specially
revealed
by
the
feeling
of
innervation
many
authors
deny
that
this
feeling
exists
and
the
proofs
given
of
its
existence
are
certainly
insufficient
the
various
degrees
of
actually
felt
in
making
the
same
movement
against
different
resistances
are
all
accounted
for
by
the
incoming
feelings
from
our
chest
jaws
abdomen
and
other
parts
sympathetically
contracted
whenever
the
effort
is
great
there
is
no
need
of
a
consciousness
of
the
amount
of
outgoing
current
required
if
anything
be
obvious
to
introspection
it
is
that
the
degree
of
strength
put
forth
is
completely
revealed
to
us
by
incoming
feelings
from
the
muscles
themselves
and
their
insertions
from
the
vicinity
of
the
joints
and
from
the
general
fixation
of
the
larynx
chest
face
and
body
when
a
certain
degree
of
energy
of
contraction
rather
than
another
is
thought
of
by
us
this
complex
aggregate
of
afferent
feelings
forming
the
material
of
our
thought
renders
absolutely
precise
and
distinctive
our
mental
image
of
the
exact
strength
of
movement
to
be
made
and
the
exact
amount
of
resistance
to
be
overcome
let
the
reader
try
to
direct
his
will
towards
a
particular
movement
and
then
notice
what
the
direction
of
the
will
was
it
anything
over
and
above
the
notion
of
the
different
feelings
to
which
the
movement
when
effected
would
give
rise
if
we
abstract
from
these
feelings
will
any
sign
principle
or
means
of
orientation
be
left
by
which
the
will
may
innervate
the
proper
muscles
with
the
right
intensity
and
not
go
astray
into
the
wrong
ones
strip
off
these
images
anticipative
of
the
results
of
the
motion
and
so
far
from
leaving
us
with
a
complete
assortment
of
directions
into
which
our
will
may
launch
itself
you
leave
our
consciousness
in
an
absolute
and
total
vacuum
if
i
will
to
write
rather
than
it
is
the
thought
of
certain
digital
sensations
of
certain
alphabetic
sounds
of
certain
appearances
on
the
paper
and
of
no
others
which
immediately
precedes
the
motion
of
my
pen
if
i
will
to
utter
the
word
rather
than
it
is
the
thought
of
my
voice
falling
on
my
ear
and
of
certain
muscular
feelings
in
my
tongue
lips
and
larynx
which
guide
the
utterance
all
these
are
incoming
feelings
and
between
the
thought
of
them
by
which
the
act
is
mentally
specified
with
all
possible
completeness
and
the
act
itself
there
is
no
room
for
any
third
order
of
mental
phenomenon
there
is
indeed
the
the
element
of
consent
or
resolve
that
the
act
shall
ensue
this
doubtless
to
the
reader
mind
as
to
my
own
constitutes
the
essence
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
act
this
will
be
treated
of
in
detail
farther
on
it
may
be
entirely
neglected
here
for
it
is
a
constant
coefficient
affecting
all
voluntary
actions
alike
and
incapable
of
serving
to
distinguish
them
no
one
will
pretend
that
its
quality
varies
according
as
the
right
arm
for
example
or
the
left
is
used
anticipatory
image
then
of
the
sensorial
consequences
of
a
movement
plus
on
certain
occasions
the
fiat
that
these
consequences
shall
become
actual
is
the
only
psychic
state
which
introspection
lets
us
discern
as
the
forerunner
of
our
voluntary
there
is
no
coercive
evidence
of
any
feeling
attached
to
the
efferent
discharge
the
entire
content
and
material
of
our
consciousness
consciousness
of
movement
as
of
all
things
else
seems
thus
to
be
of
peripheral
origin
and
to
come
to
us
in
the
first
instance
through
the
peripheral
nerves
let
us
call
the
last
idea
which
in
the
mind
precedes
the
motor
discharge
the
now
do
images
form
the
only
or
will
ones
equally
suffice
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
cue
may
be
an
image
either
of
the
resident
or
of
the
remote
although
at
the
outset
of
our
learning
a
movement
it
would
seem
that
the
resident
feelings
must
come
strongly
before
consciousness
later
this
need
not
be
the
case
the
rule
in
fact
would
seem
to
be
that
they
tend
to
lapse
more
and
more
from
consciousness
and
that
the
more
practised
we
become
in
a
movement
the
more
do
the
ideas
become
which
form
its
mental
cue
what
we
are
in
is
what
sticks
in
our
consciousness
everything
else
we
get
rid
of
as
quickly
as
we
can
our
resident
feelings
of
movement
have
no
substantive
interest
for
us
at
all
as
a
rule
what
interest
us
are
the
ends
which
the
movement
is
to
attain
such
an
end
is
generally
a
remote
sensation
an
impression
which
the
movement
produces
on
the
eye
or
ear
or
sometimes
on
the
skin
nose
or
palate
now
let
the
idea
of
such
an
end
associate
itself
definitely
with
the
right
discharge
and
the
thought
of
the
innervation
effects
will
become
as
great
an
encumbrance
as
we
have
already
concluded
that
the
feeling
of
the
innervation
itself
is
the
mind
does
not
need
it
the
end
alone
is
enough
the
idea
of
the
end
then
tends
more
and
more
to
make
itself
or
at
any
rate
if
the
kinÃ¦sthetic
ideas
are
called
up
at
all
they
are
so
swamped
in
the
vivid
kinÃ¦sthetic
feelings
by
which
they
are
immediately
overtaken
that
we
have
no
time
to
be
aware
of
their
separate
existence
as
i
write
i
have
no
anticipation
as
a
thing
distinct
from
my
sensation
of
either
the
look
or
the
digital
feel
of
the
letters
which
flow
from
my
pen
the
words
chime
on
my
mental
as
it
were
before
i
write
them
but
not
on
my
mental
eye
or
hand
this
comes
from
the
rapidity
with
which
the
movements
follow
on
their
mental
cue
an
end
consented
to
as
soon
as
conceived
innervates
directly
the
centre
of
the
first
movement
of
the
chain
which
leads
to
its
accomplishment
and
then
the
whole
chain
rattles
off
as
was
described
on
pp
the
reader
will
certainly
recognize
this
to
be
true
in
all
fluent
and
unhesitating
voluntary
acts
the
only
special
fiat
there
is
at
the
outset
of
the
performance
a
man
says
to
himself
i
must
change
my
clothes
and
involuntarily
he
has
taken
off
his
coat
and
his
fingers
are
at
work
in
their
accustomed
manner
on
his
etc
or
we
say
i
must
go
downstairs
and
ere
we
know
it
we
have
risen
walked
and
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
all
through
the
idea
of
an
end
coupled
with
a
series
of
guiding
sensations
which
successively
arise
it
would
seem
indeed
that
we
fail
of
accuracy
and
certainty
in
our
attainment
of
the
end
whenever
we
are
preoccupied
with
the
way
in
which
the
movement
will
feel
we
walk
a
beam
the
better
the
less
we
think
of
the
position
of
our
feet
upon
it
we
pitch
or
catch
we
shoot
or
chop
the
better
the
less
tactile
and
muscular
the
less
resident
and
the
more
exclusively
optical
the
more
remote
our
consciousness
is
keep
your
on
the
place
aimed
at
and
your
hand
will
fetch
it
think
of
your
hand
and
you
will
very
likely
miss
your
aim
southard
found
that
he
could
touch
a
spot
with
a
more
accurately
with
a
visual
than
with
a
tactile
mental
cue
in
the
former
case
he
looked
at
a
small
object
and
closed
his
eyes
before
trying
to
touch
it
in
the
latter
case
he
it
with
closed
eyes
and
then
after
removing
his
hand
tried
to
touch
it
again
the
average
error
with
touch
when
the
results
were
most
favorable
was
mm
with
sight
it
was
only
all
these
are
plain
results
of
introspection
and
observation
by
what
neural
machinery
they
are
made
possible
we
do
not
know
in
chapter
xix
we
saw
how
enormously
individuals
differ
in
respect
to
their
mental
imagery
in
the
type
of
imagination
called
by
the
french
authors
it
is
probable
that
the
kinÃ¦sthetic
ideas
are
more
prominent
than
in
my
account
we
must
not
expect
too
great
a
uniformity
in
individual
accounts
nor
wrangle
overmuch
as
to
which
one
represents
the
process
i
trust
that
i
have
now
made
clear
what
that
of
a
movement
is
which
must
precede
it
in
order
that
it
be
voluntary
it
is
not
the
thought
of
the
innervation
which
the
movement
requires
it
is
the
anticipation
of
the
movement
sensible
effects
resident
or
remote
and
sometimes
very
remote
indeed
such
anticipations
to
say
the
least
determine
our
movements
shall
be
i
have
spoken
all
along
as
if
they
also
might
determine
they
shall
be
this
no
doubt
has
disconcerted
many
readers
for
it
certainly
seems
as
if
a
special
fiat
or
consent
to
the
movement
were
required
in
addition
to
the
mere
conception
of
it
in
many
cases
of
volition
and
this
fiat
i
have
altogether
left
out
of
my
account
this
leads
us
to
the
next
point
in
our
discussion
the
question
is
this
the
bare
idea
of
a
movement
sensible
effects
its
sufficient
or
must
there
be
an
additional
mental
antecedent
in
the
shape
of
a
fiat
decision
consent
volitional
mandate
or
other
synonymous
phenomenon
of
consciousness
before
the
movement
can
follow
i
answer
sometimes
the
bare
idea
is
sufficient
but
sometimes
an
additional
conscious
element
in
the
shape
of
a
fiat
mandate
or
express
consent
has
to
intervene
and
precede
the
movement
the
cases
without
a
fiat
constitute
the
more
fundamental
because
the
more
simple
variety
the
others
involve
a
special
complication
which
must
be
fully
discussed
at
the
proper
time
for
the
present
let
us
turn
to
as
it
has
been
termed
or
the
sequence
of
movement
upon
the
mere
thought
of
it
without
a
special
fiat
as
the
type
of
the
process
of
volition
wherever
a
movement
and
follows
upon
the
idea
of
it
we
have
action
we
are
then
aware
of
nothing
between
the
conception
and
the
execution
all
sorts
of
processes
come
between
of
course
but
we
know
absolutely
nothing
of
them
we
think
the
act
and
it
is
done
and
that
is
all
that
introspection
tells
us
of
the
matter
carpenter
who
first
used
i
believe
the
name
of
action
placed
it
if
i
mistake
not
among
the
curiosities
of
our
mental
life
the
truth
is
that
it
is
no
curiosity
but
simply
the
normal
process
stripped
of
disguise
whilst
talking
i
become
conscious
of
a
pin
on
the
floor
or
of
some
dust
on
my
sleeve
without
interrupting
the
conversation
i
brush
away
the
dust
or
pick
up
the
pin
i
make
no
express
resolve
but
the
mere
perception
of
the
object
and
the
fleeting
notion
of
the
act
seem
of
themselves
to
bring
the
latter
about
similarly
i
sit
at
table
after
dinner
and
find
myself
from
time
to
time
taking
nuts
or
raisins
out
of
the
dish
and
eating
them
my
dinner
properly
is
over
and
in
the
heat
of
the
conversation
i
am
hardly
aware
of
what
i
do
but
the
perception
of
the
fruit
and
the
fleeting
notion
that
i
may
eat
it
seem
fatally
to
bring
the
act
about
there
is
certainly
no
express
fiat
here
any
more
than
there
is
in
all
those
habitual
goings
and
comings
and
rearrangements
of
ourselves
which
fill
every
hour
of
the
day
and
which
incoming
sensations
instigate
so
immediately
that
it
is
often
difficult
to
decide
whether
not
to
call
them
reflex
rather
than
voluntary
acts
as
lotze
says
we
see
in
writing
or
a
great
number
of
very
complicated
movements
following
quickly
one
upon
the
other
the
instigative
representations
of
which
remained
scarcely
a
second
in
consciousness
certainly
not
long
enough
to
awaken
any
other
volition
than
the
general
one
of
resigning
one
self
without
reserve
to
the
passing
over
of
representation
into
action
all
the
acts
of
our
daily
life
happen
in
this
wise
our
standing
up
walking
talking
all
this
never
demands
a
distinct
impulse
of
the
will
but
is
adequately
brought
about
by
the
pure
flux
of
thought
in
all
this
the
determining
condition
of
the
unhesitating
and
resistless
sequence
of
the
act
seems
to
be
absence
of
any
conflicting
notion
in
the
either
there
is
nothing
else
at
all
in
the
mind
or
what
is
there
does
not
conflict
we
know
what
it
is
to
get
out
of
bed
on
a
freezing
morning
in
a
room
without
a
fire
and
how
the
very
vital
principle
within
us
protests
against
the
ordeal
probably
most
persons
have
lain
on
certain
mornings
for
an
hour
at
a
time
unable
to
brace
themselves
to
the
resolve
we
think
how
late
we
shall
be
how
the
duties
of
the
day
will
suffer
we
say
i
get
up
this
is
ignominious
etc
but
still
the
warm
couch
feels
too
delicious
the
cold
outside
too
cruel
and
resolutions
faints
away
and
postpones
itself
again
and
again
just
as
it
seemed
on
the
verge
of
bursting
the
resistance
and
passing
over
into
the
decisive
act
now
how
do
we
get
up
under
such
circumstances
if
i
may
generalize
from
my
own
experience
we
more
often
than
not
get
up
without
any
struggle
or
decision
at
all
we
suddenly
find
that
we
got
up
a
fortunate
lapse
of
consciousness
occurs
we
forget
both
the
warmth
and
the
cold
we
fall
into
some
revery
connected
with
the
day
life
in
the
course
of
which
the
idea
flashes
across
us
hollo
i
must
lie
here
no
longer
an
idea
which
at
that
lucky
instant
awakens
no
contradictory
or
paralyzing
suggestions
and
consequently
produces
immediately
its
appropriate
motor
effects
it
was
our
acute
consciousness
of
both
the
warmth
and
the
cold
during
the
period
of
struggle
which
paralyzed
our
activity
then
and
kept
our
idea
of
rising
in
the
condition
of
and
not
of
the
moment
these
inhibitory
ideas
ceased
the
original
idea
exerted
its
effects
this
case
seems
to
me
to
contain
in
miniature
form
the
data
for
an
entire
psychology
of
volition
it
was
in
fact
through
meditating
on
the
phenomenon
in
my
own
person
that
i
first
became
convinced
of
the
truth
of
the
doctrine
which
these
pages
present
and
which
i
need
here
illustrate
by
no
farther
examples
the
reason
why
that
doctrine
is
not
a
truth
is
that
we
have
so
many
ideas
which
result
in
action
but
it
will
be
seen
that
in
every
such
case
without
exception
that
is
because
other
ideas
simultaneously
present
rob
them
of
their
impulsive
power
but
even
here
and
when
a
movement
is
inhibited
from
taking
place
by
contrary
ideas
it
will
take
place
to
quote
lotze
once
more
the
spectator
accompanies
the
throwing
of
a
or
the
thrust
of
the
swordsman
with
slight
movements
of
his
arm
the
untaught
narrator
tells
his
story
with
many
gesticulations
the
reader
while
absorbed
in
the
perusal
of
a
feels
a
slight
tension
run
through
his
muscular
system
keeping
time
as
it
were
with
the
actions
he
is
reading
of
these
results
become
the
more
marked
the
more
we
are
absorbed
in
thinking
of
the
movements
which
suggest
them
they
grow
fainter
exactly
in
proportion
as
a
complex
consciousness
under
the
dominion
of
a
crowd
of
other
representations
withstands
the
passing
over
of
mental
contemplation
into
outward
action
the
the
exhibitions
of
or
more
properly
which
have
lately
grown
so
fashionable
are
based
on
this
incipient
obedience
of
muscular
contraction
to
idea
even
when
the
deliberate
intention
is
that
no
contraction
shall
occur
we
may
then
lay
it
down
for
certain
that
representation
of
a
movement
awakens
in
some
degree
the
actual
movement
which
is
its
object
and
awakens
it
in
a
maximum
degree
whenever
it
is
not
kept
from
so
doing
by
an
antagonistic
representation
present
simultaneously
to
the
the
express
fiat
or
act
of
mental
consent
to
the
movement
comes
in
when
the
neutralization
of
the
antagonistic
and
inhibitory
idea
is
required
but
that
there
is
no
express
fiat
needed
when
the
conditions
are
simple
the
reader
ought
now
to
be
convinced
lest
however
he
should
still
share
the
common
prejudice
that
voluntary
action
without
of
is
hamlet
with
the
prince
part
left
out
i
will
make
a
few
farther
remarks
the
first
point
to
start
from
in
understanding
voluntary
action
and
the
possible
occurrence
of
it
with
no
fiat
or
express
resolve
is
the
fact
that
consciousness
is
its
very
nature
we
do
not
first
have
a
sensation
or
thought
and
then
have
to
something
dynamic
to
it
to
get
a
movement
every
pulse
of
feeling
which
we
have
is
the
correlate
of
some
neural
activity
that
is
already
on
its
way
to
instigate
a
movement
our
sensations
and
thoughts
are
but
as
it
were
of
currents
whose
essential
consequence
is
motion
and
which
have
no
sooner
run
in
at
one
nerve
than
they
are
ready
to
run
out
by
another
the
popular
notion
that
consciousness
is
not
essentially
a
forerunner
of
activity
but
that
the
latter
must
result
from
some
superadded
is
a
very
natural
inference
from
those
special
cases
in
which
we
think
of
an
act
for
an
indefinite
length
of
time
without
the
action
taking
place
these
cases
however
are
not
the
norm
they
are
cases
of
inhibition
by
antagonistic
thoughts
when
the
blocking
is
released
we
feel
as
if
an
inward
spring
were
let
loose
and
this
is
the
additional
impulse
or
upon
which
the
act
effectively
succeeds
we
shall
study
anon
the
blocking
and
its
release
our
higher
thought
is
full
of
it
but
where
there
is
no
blocking
there
is
naturally
no
hiatus
between
the
and
the
motor
discharge
is
the
natural
immediate
effect
of
the
process
of
feeling
irrespective
of
what
the
quality
of
the
feeling
may
be
it
is
so
in
reflex
action
it
is
so
in
emotional
expression
it
is
so
in
the
voluntary
action
is
thus
no
paradox
to
be
softened
or
explained
away
it
obeys
the
type
of
all
conscious
action
and
from
it
one
must
start
to
explain
the
sort
of
action
in
which
a
special
fiat
is
involved
it
may
be
remarked
in
passing
that
the
inhibition
of
a
movement
no
more
involves
an
express
effort
or
command
than
its
execution
does
either
of
them
require
it
but
in
all
simple
and
ordinary
cases
just
as
the
bare
presence
of
one
idea
prompts
a
movement
so
the
bare
presence
of
another
idea
will
prevent
its
taking
place
try
to
feel
as
if
you
were
crooking
your
finger
whilst
keeping
it
straight
in
a
minute
it
will
fairly
tingle
with
the
imaginary
change
of
position
yet
it
will
not
sensibly
move
because
not
really
is
also
a
part
of
what
you
have
in
mind
drop
idea
think
purely
and
simply
of
the
movement
and
nothing
else
and
presto
it
takes
place
with
no
effort
at
all
a
waking
man
behavior
is
thus
at
all
times
the
resultant
of
two
opposing
neural
forces
with
unimaginable
fineness
some
currents
among
the
cells
and
fibres
of
his
brain
are
playing
on
his
motor
nerves
whilst
other
currents
as
unimaginably
fine
are
playing
on
the
first
currents
damming
or
helping
them
altering
their
direction
or
their
speed
the
upshot
of
it
all
is
that
whilst
the
currents
must
always
end
by
being
drained
off
through
motor
nerves
they
are
drained
off
sometimes
through
one
set
and
sometimes
through
another
and
sometimes
they
keep
each
other
in
equilibrium
so
long
that
a
superficial
observer
may
think
they
are
not
drained
off
at
all
such
an
observer
must
remember
however
that
from
the
physiological
point
of
view
a
gesture
an
expression
of
the
brow
or
an
expulsion
of
the
breath
are
movements
as
much
as
an
act
of
locomotion
is
a
king
breath
slays
as
well
as
an
assassin
blow
and
the
outpouring
of
those
currents
which
the
magic
imponderable
streaming
of
our
ideas
accompanies
need
not
always
be
of
an
explosive
or
otherwise
physically
conspicuous
kind
after
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
describe
happens
in
deliberate
or
when
the
mind
has
many
objects
before
it
related
to
each
other
in
antagonistic
or
in
favorable
ways
one
of
these
objects
of
its
thought
may
be
an
act
by
itself
this
would
prompt
a
movement
some
of
the
additional
objects
or
considerations
however
block
the
motor
discharge
whilst
others
on
the
contrary
solicit
it
to
take
place
the
result
is
that
peculiar
feeling
of
inward
unrest
known
as
fortunately
it
is
too
familiar
to
need
description
for
to
describe
it
would
be
impossible
as
long
as
it
lasts
with
the
various
objects
before
the
attention
we
are
said
to
and
when
finally
the
original
suggestion
either
prevails
and
makes
the
movement
take
place
or
gets
definitively
quenched
by
its
antagonists
we
are
said
to
or
to
our
voluntary
in
favor
of
one
or
the
other
course
the
reinforcing
and
inhibiting
objects
meanwhile
are
termed
the
or
by
which
the
decision
is
brought
about
the
process
of
deliberation
contains
endless
degrees
of
complication
at
every
moment
of
it
our
consciousness
is
of
an
extremely
complex
thing
namely
the
whole
set
of
motives
and
their
conflict
of
this
complicated
object
the
totality
of
which
is
realized
more
or
less
dimly
all
the
while
by
consciousness
certain
parts
stand
out
more
or
less
sharply
at
one
moment
in
the
foreground
and
at
another
moment
other
parts
in
consequence
of
the
oscillations
of
our
attention
and
of
the
flow
of
our
ideas
but
no
matter
how
sharp
the
may
be
or
how
imminently
close
to
bursting
through
the
dam
and
carrying
the
motor
consequences
their
own
way
the
background
however
dimly
felt
is
always
there
as
a
fringe
and
its
presence
so
long
as
the
indecision
actually
lasts
serves
as
an
effective
check
upon
the
irrevocable
discharge
the
deliberation
may
last
for
weeks
or
months
occupying
at
intervals
the
mind
the
motives
which
yesterday
seemed
full
of
urgency
and
blood
and
life
feel
strangely
weak
and
pale
and
dead
but
as
little
as
is
the
question
finally
resolved
something
tells
us
that
all
this
is
provisional
that
the
weakened
reasons
will
wax
strong
again
and
the
stronger
weaken
that
equilibrium
is
unreached
that
testing
our
reasons
not
obeying
them
is
still
the
order
of
the
day
and
that
we
must
wait
awhile
patiently
or
impatiently
until
our
mind
is
made
up
good
and
all
this
inclining
first
to
one
then
to
another
future
both
of
which
we
represent
as
possible
resembles
the
oscillations
to
and
fro
of
a
material
body
within
the
limits
of
its
elasticity
there
is
inward
strain
but
no
outward
rupture
and
this
condition
plainly
enough
is
susceptible
of
indefinite
continuance
as
well
in
the
physical
mass
as
in
the
mind
if
the
elasticity
give
way
however
if
the
dam
ever
do
break
and
the
currents
burst
the
crust
vacillation
is
over
and
decision
is
irrevocably
there
the
decision
may
come
in
either
of
many
modes
i
will
try
briefly
to
sketch
the
most
characteristic
types
of
it
merely
warning
the
reader
that
this
is
only
an
introspective
account
of
symptoms
and
phenomena
and
that
all
questions
of
causal
agency
whether
neural
or
spiritual
are
relegated
to
a
later
page
chief
types
of
turning
now
to
the
form
of
the
decision
itself
we
may
distinguish
five
chief
types
first
may
be
called
the
reasonable
it
is
that
of
those
cases
in
which
the
arguments
for
and
against
a
given
course
seem
gradually
and
almost
insensibly
to
settle
themselves
in
the
mind
and
to
end
by
leaving
a
clear
balance
in
favor
of
one
alternative
which
alternative
we
then
adopt
without
effort
or
constraint
until
this
rational
balancing
of
the
books
is
consummated
we
have
a
calm
feeling
that
the
evidence
is
not
yet
all
in
and
this
keeps
action
in
suspense
but
some
day
we
wake
with
the
sense
that
we
see
the
matter
rightly
that
no
new
light
will
be
thrown
on
it
by
farther
delay
and
that
it
had
better
be
settled
in
this
easy
transition
from
doubt
to
assurance
we
seem
to
ourselves
almost
passive
the
which
decide
us
appearing
to
flow
in
from
the
nature
of
things
and
to
owe
nothing
to
our
will
we
have
however
a
perfect
sense
of
being
in
that
we
are
devoid
of
any
feeling
of
coercion
the
conclusive
reason
for
the
decision
in
these
cases
usually
is
the
discovery
that
we
can
refer
the
case
to
a
upon
which
we
are
accustomed
to
act
unhesitatingly
in
a
certain
stereotyped
way
it
may
be
said
in
general
that
a
great
part
of
every
deliberation
consists
in
the
turning
over
of
all
the
possible
modes
of
the
doing
or
not
doing
of
the
act
in
point
the
moment
we
hit
upon
a
conception
which
lets
us
apply
some
principle
of
action
which
is
a
fixed
and
stable
part
of
our
ego
our
state
of
doubt
is
at
an
end
persons
of
authority
who
have
to
make
many
decisions
in
the
day
carry
with
them
a
set
of
heads
of
classification
each
bearing
its
volitional
consequence
and
under
these
they
seek
as
far
as
possible
to
range
each
new
emergency
as
it
occurs
it
is
where
the
emergency
belongs
to
a
species
without
precedent
to
which
consequently
no
maxim
will
apply
that
we
feel
most
at
a
loss
and
are
distressed
at
the
indeterminateness
of
our
task
as
soon
however
as
we
see
our
way
to
a
familiar
classification
we
are
at
ease
again
action
as
in
reasoning
then
the
great
thing
is
the
quest
of
the
right
the
concrete
dilemmas
do
not
come
to
us
with
labels
gummed
upon
their
backs
we
may
name
them
by
many
names
the
wise
man
is
he
who
succeeds
in
finding
the
name
which
suits
the
needs
of
the
particular
occasion
best
a
character
is
one
who
has
a
store
of
stable
and
worthy
ends
and
who
does
not
decide
about
an
action
till
he
has
calmly
ascertained
whether
it
be
ministerial
or
detrimental
to
any
one
of
these
in
the
next
two
types
of
decision
the
final
fiat
occurs
before
the
evidence
is
all
it
often
happens
that
no
paramount
and
authoritative
reason
for
either
course
will
come
either
seems
a
good
and
there
is
no
umpire
to
decide
which
should
yield
its
place
to
the
other
we
grow
tired
of
long
hesitation
and
inconclusiveness
and
the
hour
may
come
when
we
feel
that
even
a
bad
decision
is
better
than
no
decision
at
all
under
these
conditions
it
will
often
happen
that
some
accidental
circumstance
supervening
at
a
particular
movement
upon
our
mental
weariness
will
upset
the
balance
in
the
direction
of
one
of
the
alternatives
to
which
then
we
feel
ourselves
committed
although
an
opposite
accident
at
the
same
time
might
have
produced
the
opposite
result
in
the
our
feeling
is
to
a
great
extent
that
of
letting
ourselves
drift
with
a
certain
indifferent
acquiescence
in
a
direction
accidentally
determined
with
the
conviction
that
after
all
we
might
as
well
stand
by
this
course
as
by
the
other
and
that
things
are
in
any
event
sure
to
turn
out
sufficiently
right
the
third
the
determination
seems
equally
accidental
but
it
comes
from
within
and
not
from
without
it
often
happens
when
the
absence
of
imperative
principle
is
perplexing
and
suspense
distracting
that
we
find
ourselves
acting
as
it
were
automatically
and
as
if
by
a
spontaneous
discharge
of
our
nerves
in
the
direction
of
one
of
the
horns
of
the
dilemma
but
so
exciting
is
this
sense
of
motion
after
our
intolerable
state
that
we
eagerly
throw
ourselves
into
it
now
we
inwardly
cry
the
heavens
fall
this
reckless
and
exultant
espousal
of
an
energy
so
little
premeditated
by
us
that
we
feel
rather
like
passive
spectators
cheering
on
the
display
of
some
extraneous
force
than
like
voluntary
agents
is
a
type
of
decision
too
abrupt
and
tumultuous
to
occur
often
in
humdrum
and
natures
but
it
is
probably
frequent
in
persons
of
strong
emotional
endowment
and
unstable
or
vacillating
character
and
in
men
of
the
type
the
napoleons
luthers
in
whom
tenacious
passion
combines
with
ebullient
activity
when
by
any
chance
the
passion
outlet
has
been
dammed
by
scruples
or
apprehensions
the
resolution
is
probably
often
of
this
catastrophic
kind
the
flood
breaks
quite
unexpectedly
through
the
dam
that
it
should
so
often
do
so
is
quite
sufficient
to
account
for
the
tendency
of
these
characters
to
a
fatalistic
mood
of
mind
and
the
fatalistic
mood
itself
is
sure
to
reinforce
the
strength
of
the
energy
just
started
on
its
exciting
path
of
discharge
there
is
a
of
decision
which
often
ends
deliberation
as
suddenly
as
the
third
form
does
it
comes
when
in
consequence
of
some
outer
experience
or
some
inexplicable
inward
change
suddenly
pass
from
the
easy
and
careless
to
the
sober
and
strenuous
or
possibly
the
other
way
the
whole
scale
of
values
of
our
motives
and
impulses
then
undergoes
a
change
like
that
which
a
change
of
the
observer
level
produces
on
a
view
the
most
sobering
possible
agents
are
objects
of
grief
and
fear
when
one
of
these
affects
us
all
notions
lose
their
motive
power
all
solemn
ones
find
theirs
multiplied
the
consequence
is
an
instant
abandonment
of
the
more
trivial
projects
with
which
we
had
been
dallying
and
an
instant
practical
acceptance
of
the
more
grim
and
earnest
alternative
which
till
then
could
not
extort
our
mind
consent
all
those
of
heart
of
conscience
which
make
new
men
of
so
many
of
us
may
be
classed
under
this
head
the
character
abruptly
rises
to
another
and
deliberation
comes
to
an
immediate
end
in
the
and
final
of
decision
the
feeling
that
the
evidence
is
all
in
and
that
reason
has
balanced
the
books
may
be
either
present
or
absent
but
in
either
case
we
feel
in
deciding
as
if
we
ourselves
by
our
own
wilful
act
inclined
the
beam
in
the
former
case
by
adding
our
living
effort
to
the
weight
of
the
logical
reason
which
taken
alone
seems
powerless
to
make
the
act
discharge
in
the
latter
by
a
kind
of
creative
contribution
of
something
instead
of
a
reason
which
does
a
reason
work
the
slow
dead
heave
of
the
will
that
is
felt
in
these
instances
makes
of
them
a
class
altogether
different
subjectively
from
all
the
four
preceding
classes
what
the
heave
of
the
will
betokens
metaphysically
what
the
effort
might
lead
us
to
infer
about
a
distinct
from
motives
are
not
matters
that
concern
us
yet
subjectively
and
phenomenally
the
of
absent
from
the
former
decisions
accompanies
these
whether
it
be
the
dreary
resignation
for
the
sake
of
austere
and
naked
duty
of
all
sorts
of
rich
mundane
delights
or
whether
it
be
the
heavy
resolve
that
of
two
mutually
exclusive
trains
of
future
fact
both
sweet
and
good
and
with
no
strictly
objective
or
imperative
principle
of
choice
between
them
one
shall
forevermore
become
impossible
while
the
other
shall
become
reality
it
is
a
desolate
and
acrid
sort
of
act
an
entrance
into
a
lonesome
moral
wilderness
if
examined
closely
its
chief
difference
from
the
former
cases
appears
to
be
that
in
those
cases
the
mind
at
the
moment
of
deciding
on
the
triumphant
alternative
dropped
the
other
one
wholly
or
nearly
out
of
sight
whereas
here
both
alternatives
are
steadily
held
in
view
and
in
the
very
act
of
murdering
the
vanquished
possibility
the
chooser
realizes
how
much
in
that
instant
he
is
making
himself
lose
it
is
deliberately
driving
a
thorn
into
one
flesh
and
the
sense
of
with
which
the
act
is
accompanied
is
an
element
which
sets
this
fifth
type
of
decision
in
strong
contrast
with
the
previous
four
varieties
and
makes
of
it
an
altogether
peculiar
sort
of
mental
phenomenon
the
immense
majority
of
human
decisions
are
decisions
without
effort
in
comparatively
few
of
them
in
most
people
does
effort
accompany
the
final
act
we
are
i
think
misled
into
supposing
that
effort
is
more
frequent
than
it
is
by
the
fact
that
we
so
often
have
a
feeling
of
how
great
an
effort
it
would
take
to
make
a
decision
later
after
the
decision
has
made
itself
with
ease
we
recollect
this
and
erroneously
suppose
the
effort
also
to
have
been
made
then
the
existence
of
the
effort
as
a
phenomenal
fact
in
our
consciousness
can
not
of
course
be
doubted
or
denied
its
significance
on
the
other
hand
is
a
matter
about
which
the
gravest
difference
of
opinion
prevails
questions
as
momentous
as
that
of
the
very
existence
of
spiritual
causality
as
vast
as
that
of
universal
predestination
or
depend
on
its
interpretation
it
therefore
becomes
essential
that
we
study
with
some
care
the
conditions
under
which
the
feeling
of
volitional
effort
is
found
feeling
of
when
i
said
awhile
back
that
or
the
neural
process
which
goes
with
it
in
its
very
nature
i
should
have
added
the
proviso
that
must
be
sufficiently
now
there
are
remarkable
differences
in
the
power
of
different
sorts
of
consciousness
to
excite
movement
the
intensity
of
some
feelings
is
practically
apt
to
be
below
the
discharging
point
whilst
that
of
others
is
apt
to
be
above
it
by
practically
apt
i
mean
apt
under
ordinary
circumstances
these
circumstances
may
be
habitual
inhibitions
like
that
comfortable
feeling
of
the
far
which
gives
to
each
and
all
of
us
a
certain
dose
of
laziness
only
to
be
overcome
by
the
acuteness
of
the
impulsive
spur
or
they
may
consist
in
the
native
inertia
or
internal
resistance
of
the
motor
centres
themselves
making
explosion
impossible
until
a
certain
inward
tension
has
been
reached
and
these
conditions
may
vary
from
one
person
to
another
and
in
the
same
person
from
time
to
time
the
neural
inertia
may
wax
or
wane
and
the
habitual
inhibitions
dwindle
or
augment
the
intensity
of
particular
and
stimulations
may
also
change
independently
and
particular
paths
of
association
grow
more
pervious
or
less
so
there
thus
result
great
possibilities
of
alteration
in
the
actual
impulsive
efficacy
of
particular
motives
compared
with
others
it
is
where
the
normally
less
efficacious
motive
becomes
more
efficacious
and
the
normally
more
efficacious
one
less
so
that
actions
ordinarily
effortless
or
abstinences
ordinarily
easy
either
become
impossible
or
are
effected
if
at
all
by
the
expenditure
of
effort
a
little
more
description
will
make
it
plainer
what
these
cases
are
of
is
a
certain
normal
ratio
in
the
impulsive
power
of
different
mental
objects
which
characterizes
what
may
be
called
ordinary
healthiness
of
and
which
is
departed
from
only
at
exceptional
times
or
by
exceptional
individuals
the
states
of
mind
which
normally
possess
the
most
impulsive
quality
are
either
those
which
represent
objects
of
passion
appetite
or
emotion
objects
of
instinctive
reaction
in
short
or
they
are
feelings
or
ideas
of
pleasure
or
of
pain
or
ideas
which
for
any
reason
we
have
grown
accustomed
to
obey
so
that
the
habit
of
reacting
on
them
is
ingrained
or
finally
in
comparison
with
ideas
of
remoter
objects
they
are
ideas
of
objects
present
or
near
in
space
and
time
compared
with
these
various
objects
all
considerations
all
highly
abstract
conceptions
unaccustomed
reasons
and
motives
foreign
to
the
instinctive
history
of
the
race
have
little
or
no
impulsive
power
they
prevail
when
they
ever
do
prevail
the
as
distinguished
from
the
pathological
of
effort
is
thus
found
wherever
motives
to
behavior
must
be
reinforced
so
as
to
rule
the
healthiness
of
will
moreover
requires
a
certain
amount
of
complication
in
the
process
which
precedes
the
fiat
or
the
act
each
stimulus
or
idea
at
the
same
time
that
it
wakens
its
own
impulse
must
also
arouse
other
ideas
along
with
characteristic
impulses
and
action
must
finally
follow
neither
too
slowly
nor
too
rapidly
as
the
resultant
of
all
the
forces
thus
engaged
even
when
the
decision
is
pretty
prompt
the
normal
thing
is
thus
a
sort
of
preliminary
survey
of
the
field
and
a
vision
of
which
course
is
best
before
the
fiat
comes
and
where
the
will
is
healthy
vision
must
be
the
motives
must
be
on
the
whole
in
a
normal
or
not
too
unusual
ratio
to
each
other
the
action
must
obey
the
vision
of
may
thus
come
about
in
many
ways
the
action
may
follow
the
stimulus
or
idea
too
rapidly
leaving
no
time
for
the
arousal
of
restraining
associates
then
have
a
precipitate
or
although
the
associates
may
come
the
ratio
which
the
impulsive
and
inhibitive
forces
normally
bear
to
each
other
may
be
distorted
and
we
then
have
will
which
is
the
perversity
in
turn
may
be
due
to
either
of
many
causes
too
much
intensity
or
too
little
here
too
much
or
too
little
inertia
there
or
elsewhere
too
much
or
too
little
inhibitory
power
we
compare
the
outward
symptoms
of
perversity
together
they
fall
into
two
in
one
of
which
normal
actions
are
impossible
and
in
the
other
abnormal
ones
are
irrepressible
briefly
may
call
them
respectively
the
obstructed
and
the
explosive
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
however
that
since
the
resultant
action
is
always
due
to
the
between
the
obstructive
and
the
explosive
forces
which
are
present
we
never
can
tell
by
the
mere
outward
symptoms
to
what
cause
the
perversion
of
a
man
will
may
be
due
whether
to
an
increase
of
one
component
or
a
diminution
of
the
other
one
may
grow
explosive
as
readily
by
losing
the
usual
brakes
as
by
getting
up
more
of
the
impulsive
steam
and
one
may
find
things
impossible
as
well
through
the
enfeeblement
of
the
original
desire
as
through
the
advent
of
new
lions
in
the
path
as
clouston
says
the
driver
may
be
so
weak
that
he
can
not
control
horses
or
the
horses
may
be
so
that
no
driver
can
pull
them
up
explosive
defective
there
is
a
normal
type
of
character
for
example
in
which
impulses
seem
to
discharge
so
promptly
into
movements
that
inhibitions
get
no
time
to
arise
these
are
the
and
temperaments
overflowing
with
animation
and
fizzling
with
talk
which
are
so
common
in
the
slavic
and
celtic
races
and
with
which
the
and
english
character
forms
so
marked
a
contrast
simian
these
people
seem
to
us
whilst
we
seem
to
them
reptilian
it
is
quite
impossible
to
judge
as
between
an
obstructed
and
an
explosive
individual
which
has
the
greater
sum
of
vital
energy
an
explosive
italian
with
good
perception
and
intellect
will
cut
a
figure
as
a
perfectly
tremendous
fellow
on
an
inward
capital
that
could
be
tucked
away
inside
of
an
obstructed
yankee
and
hardly
let
you
know
that
it
was
there
he
will
be
the
king
of
his
company
sing
the
songs
and
make
the
speeches
lead
the
parties
carry
out
the
practical
jokes
kiss
the
girls
fight
the
men
and
if
need
be
lead
the
forlorn
hopes
and
enterprises
so
that
an
onlooker
would
think
he
has
more
life
in
his
little
finger
than
can
exist
in
the
whole
body
of
a
correct
judicious
fellow
but
the
judicious
fellow
all
the
while
may
have
all
these
possibilities
and
more
besides
ready
to
break
out
in
the
same
or
even
a
more
violent
way
if
only
the
brakes
were
taken
off
it
is
the
absence
of
scruples
of
consequences
of
considerations
the
extraordinary
simplification
of
each
moment
mental
outlook
that
gives
to
the
explosive
individual
such
motor
energy
and
ease
it
need
not
be
the
greater
intensity
of
any
of
his
passions
motives
or
thoughts
as
mental
evolution
goes
on
the
complexity
of
human
consciousness
grows
ever
greater
and
with
it
the
multiplication
of
the
inhibitions
to
which
every
impulse
is
exposed
how
much
freedom
of
discourse
we
english
folk
lose
because
we
feel
obliged
always
to
speak
the
truth
this
predominance
of
inhibition
has
a
bad
as
well
as
a
good
side
and
if
a
man
impulses
are
in
the
main
orderly
as
well
as
prompt
if
he
has
courage
to
accept
their
consequences
and
intellect
to
lead
them
to
a
successful
end
he
is
all
the
better
for
his
organization
and
for
not
being
with
the
pale
cast
of
thought
many
of
the
most
successful
military
and
revolutionary
characters
in
history
have
belonged
to
this
simple
but
impulsive
type
problems
come
much
harder
to
reflective
and
inhibitive
minds
they
can
it
is
true
solve
much
vaster
problems
and
they
can
avoid
many
a
mistake
to
which
the
men
of
impulse
are
exposed
but
when
the
latter
do
not
make
mistakes
or
when
they
are
always
able
to
retrieve
them
theirs
is
one
of
the
most
engaging
and
indispensable
of
human
types
in
infancy
and
in
certain
conditions
of
exhaustion
as
well
as
in
peculiar
pathological
states
the
inhibitory
power
may
fail
to
arrest
the
explosions
of
the
impulsive
discharge
we
have
then
an
explosive
temperament
temporarily
realized
in
an
individual
who
at
other
times
may
be
of
a
relatively
obstructed
type
in
other
persons
again
hysterics
epileptics
criminals
of
the
neurotic
class
called
by
french
authors
there
is
such
a
native
feebleness
in
the
mental
machinery
that
before
the
inhibitory
ideas
can
arise
the
impulsive
ones
have
already
discharged
into
act
in
persons
by
nature
bad
habits
can
bring
about
this
condition
especially
in
relation
to
particular
sorts
of
impulse
ask
half
the
common
drunkards
you
know
why
it
is
that
they
fall
so
often
a
prey
to
temptation
and
they
will
say
that
most
of
the
time
they
can
not
tell
it
is
a
sort
of
vertigo
with
them
their
nervous
centres
have
become
a
pathologically
unlocked
by
every
passing
conception
of
a
bottle
and
a
glass
they
do
not
thirst
for
the
beverage
the
taste
of
it
may
even
appear
repugnant
and
they
perfectly
foresee
the
morrow
remorse
but
when
they
think
of
the
liquor
or
see
it
they
find
themselves
preparing
to
drink
and
do
not
stop
themselves
and
more
than
this
they
can
not
say
similarly
a
man
may
lead
a
life
of
incessant
or
sexual
indulgence
though
what
spurs
him
thereto
seems
to
be
trivial
suggestions
and
notions
of
possibility
rather
than
any
real
solid
strength
of
passion
or
desire
such
characters
are
too
flimsy
even
to
be
bad
in
any

mussey

cincinnati
relates
this
case
a
few
years
ago
a
tippler
was
put
into
an
almshouse
in
this
state
within
a
few
days
he
had
devised
various
expedients
to
procure
rum
but
failed
at
length
however
he
hit
upon
one
which
was
successful
he
went
into
the
of
the
establishment
placed
one
hand
upon
the
block
and
with
an
axe
in
the
other
struck
it
off
at
a
single
blow
with
the
stump
raised
and
streaming
he
ran
into
the
house
and
cried
some
rum
get
some
rum
my
hand
is
off
in
the
confusion
and
bustle
of
the
occasion
a
bowl
of
rum
was
brought
into
which
he
plunged
the
bleeding
member
of
his
body
then
raising
the
bowl
to
his
mouth
drank
freely
and
exultingly
exclaimed
i
am
satisfied
turner
tells
of
a
man
who
while
under
treatment
for
inebriety
during
four
weeks
secretly
drank
the
alcohol
from
six
jars
containing
morbid
specimens
on
asking
him
why
he
had
committed
this
loathsome
act
he
replied
it
is
as
impossible
for
me
to
control
this
diseased
appetite
as
it
is
for
me
to
control
the
pulsations
of
my
heart
often
the
insistent
idea
is
of
a
trivial
sort
but
it
may
wear
the
patient
life
out
his
hands

dirty
they
must
be
washed
he
they
are
not
dirty
yet
to
get
rid
of
the
teasing
idea
he
washes
them
the
idea
however
returns
in
a
moment
and
the
unfortunate
victim
who
is
not
in
the
least
deluded
will
end
by
spending
the
whole
day
at
the
or
his
clothes
are
not
put
on
and
to
banish
the
thought
he
takes
them
off
and
puts
them
on
again
till
his
toilet
consumes
two
or
three
hours
of
time
most
people
have
the
potentiality
of
this
disease
to
few
has
it
not
happened
to
conceive
after
getting
into
bed
that
they
may
have
forgotten
to
lock
the
front
door
or
to
turn
out
the
entry
gas
and
few
of
us
have
not
on
some
occasion
got
up
to
repeat
the
performance
less
because
we
believed
in
the
reality
of
its
omission
than
because
only
so
could
we
banish
the
worrying
doubt
and
get
to
sleep
obstructed
in
striking
contrast
with
the
cases
in
which
inhibition
is
insufficient
or
impulsion

are
those
in
which
impulsion
is
insufficient
or
inhibition
in
excess
we
all
know
the
condition
described
on
in
which
the
mind
for
a
few
moments
seems
to
lose
its
focussing
power
and
to
be
unable
to
rally
its
attention
to
any
determinate
thing
at
such
times
we
sit
blankly
staring
and
do
nothing
the
objects
of
consciousness
fail
to
touch
the
quick
or
break
the
skin
they
are
there
but
do
not
reach
the
level
of
effectiveness
this
state
of
presence
is
the
normal
condition
of
objects
in
all
of
us
great
fatigue
or
exhaustion
may
make
it
the
condition
of
almost
all
objects

an
apathy
resembling
that
then
brought
about

recognized
in
asylums
under

as

both
that

and
that

should
obey

in
the
morbid
condition
in

the
vision
may
be

unaffected
and
the

and
yet
the

either
fails

meliora
proboque
deteriora
is
the
classic
expression
of
this
latter
condition
of
mind
the
moral
tragedy
of
human
life
comes
almost
wholly
from
the
fact
that
the
link
is
ruptured
which
normally
should
hold
between
vision
of
the
truth
and
action
and
that
this
pungent
sense
of
effective
reality
will
not
attach
to
certain
ideas
men
do
not
differ
so
much
in
their
mere
feelings
and
conceptions
their
notions
of
possibility
and
their
ideals
are
not
as
far
apart
as
might
be
argued
from
their
differing
fates
no
class
of
them
have
better
sentiments
or
feel
more
constantly
the
difference
between
the
higher
and
the
lower
path
in
life
than
the
hopeless
failures
the
sentimentalists
the
drunkards
the
schemers
the
whose
life
is
one
long
contradiction
between
knowledge
and
action
and
who
with
full
command
of
theory
never
get
to
holding
their
limp
characters
erect
no
one
eats
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
as
they
do
as
far
as
moral
insight
goes
in
comparison
with
them
the
orderly
and
prosperous
philistines
whom
they
scandalize
are
sucking
babes
and
yet
their
moral
knowledge
always
there
grumbling
and
rumbling
in
the
background
discerning
commenting
protesting
longing
half
resolving
never
wholly
resolves
never
gets
its
voice
out
of
the
minor
into
the
major
key
or
its
speech
out
of
the
subjunctive
into
the
imperative
mood
never
breaks
the
spell
never
takes
the
helm
into
its
hands
in
such
characters
as
rousseau
and
restif
it
would
seem
as
if
the
lower
motives
had
all
the
impulsive
efficacy
in
their
hands
like
trains
with
the
right
of
way
they
retain
exclusive
possession
of
the
track
the
more
ideal
motives
exist
alongside
of
them
in
profusion
but
they
never
get
switched
on
and
the
man
conduct
is
no
more
influenced
by
them
than
an
express
train
is
influenced
by
a
wayfarer
standing
by
the
roadside
and
calling
to
be
taken
aboard
they
are
an
inert
accompaniment
to
the
end
of
time
and
the
consciousness
of
inward
hollowness
that
accrues
from
habitually
seeing
the
better
only
to
do
the
worse
is
one
of
the
saddest
feelings
one
can
bear
with
him
through
this
vale
of
tears
feels
like
an
original
we
now
see
at
one
view
when
it
is
that
effort
complicates
volition
it
does
so
whenever
a
rarer
and
more
ideal
impulse
is
called
upon
to
neutralize
others
of
a
more
instinctive
and
habitual
kind
it
does
so
whenever
strongly
explosive
tendencies
are
checked
or
strongly
obstructive
conditions
overcome
the
bien
the
child
of
the
sunshine
at
whose
birth
the
fairies
made
their
gifts
does
not
need
much
of
it
in
his
life
the
hero
and
the
neurotic
subject
on
the
other
hand
do
now
our
spontaneous
way
of
conceiving
the
effort
under
all
these
circumstances
is
as
an
active
force
adding
its
strength
to
that
of
the
motives
which
ultimately
prevail
when
outer
forces
impinge
upon
a
body
we
say
that
the
resultant
motion
is
in
the
line
of
least
resistance
or
of
greatest
traction
but
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
our
spontaneous
language
never
speaks
of
volition
with
effort
in
this
way
of
course
if
we
proceed
and
define
the
line
of
least
resistance
as
the
line
that
is
followed
the
physical
law
must
also
hold
good
in
the
mental
sphere
but
we
in
all
hard
cases
of
volition
as
if
the
line
taken
when
the
rarer
and
more
ideal
motives
prevail
were
the
line
of
greater
resistance
and
as
if
the
line
of
coarser
motivation
were
the
more
pervious
and
easy
one
even
at
the
very
moment
when
we
refuse
to
follow
it
he
who
under
the
surgeon
knife
represses
cries
of
pain
or
he
who
exposes
himself
to
social
obloquy
for
duty
sake
feels
as
if
he
were
following
the
line
of
greatest
temporary
resistance
he
speaks
of
conquering
and
overcoming
his
impulses
and
temptations
but
the
sluggard
the
drunkard
the
coward
never
talk
of
their
conduct
in
that
way
or
say
they
resist
their
energy
overcome
their
sobriety
conquer
their
courage
and
so
forth
if
in
general
we
class
all
springs
of
action
as
propensities
on
the
one
hand
and
ideals
on
the
other
the
sensualist
never
says
of
his
behavior
that
it
results
from
a
victory
over
his
ideals
but
the
moralist
always
speaks
of
his
as
a
victory
over
his
propensities
the
sensualist
uses
terms
of
inactivity
says
he
forgets
his
ideals
is
deaf
to
duty
and
so
forth
which
terms
seem
to
imply
that
the
ideal
motives
can
be
annulled
without
energy
or
effort
and
that
the
strongest
mere
traction
lies
in
the
line
of
the
propensities
the
ideal
impulse
appears
in
comparison
with
this
a
still
small
voice
which
must
be
artificially
reinforced
to
prevail
effort
is
what
reinforces
it
making
things
seem
as
if
while
the
force
of
propensity
were
essentially
a
fixed
quantity
the
ideal
force
might
be
of
various
amount
but
what
determines
the
amount
of
the
effort
when
by
its
aid
an
ideal
motive
becomes
victorious
over
a
great
sensual
resistance
the
very
greatness
of
the
resistance
itself
if
the
sensual
propensity
is
small
the
effort
is
small
the
latter
is
by
the
presence
of
a
great
antagonist
to
overcome
and
if
a
brief
definition
of
ideal
or
moral
action
were
required
none
could
be
given
which
would
better
fit
the
appearances
than
this
is
action
in
the
line
of
the
greatest
the
facts
may
be
most
briefly
symbolized
thus
p
standing
for
the
propensity
i
for
the
ideal
impulse
and
e
for
the
effort
i
i
e
in
other
words
if
e
adds
itself
to
i
p
immediately
offers
the
least
resistance
and
motion
occurs
in
spite
of
it
but
the
e
does
not
seem
to
form
an
integral
part
of
the
i
it
appears
adventitious
and
indeterminate
in
advance
we
can
make
more
or
less
as
we
please
and
we
make
enough
we
can
convert
the
greatest
mental
resistance
into
the
least
such
at
least
is
the
impression
which
the
facts
spontaneously
produce
upon
us
but
we
will
not
discuss
the
truth
of
this
impression
at
present
let
us
rather
continue
our
descriptive
detail
and
pain
as
springs
of
objects
and
thoughts
of
objects
start
our
action
but
the
pleasures
and
pains
which
action
brings
modify
its
course
and
regulate
it
and
later
the
thoughts
of
the
pleasures
and
the
pains
acquire
themselves
impulsive
and
inhibitive
power
not
that
the
thought
of
a
pleasure
need
be
itself
a
pleasure
usually
it
is
the
reverse
maggior
as
dante
says
and
not
that
the
thought
of
pain
need
be
a
pain
for
as
homer
says
griefs
are
often
afterwards
an
entertainment
but
as
present
pleasures
are
tremendous
reinforcers
and
present
pains
tremendous
inhibitors
of
whatever
action
leads
to
them
so
the
thoughts
of
pleasures
and
pains
take
rank
amongst
the
thoughts
which
have
most
impulsive
and
inhibitive
power
the
precise
relation
which
these
thoughts
hold
to
other
thoughts
is
thus
a
matter
demanding
some
attention
if
a
movement
feels
agreeable
we
repeat
and
repeat
it
as
long
as
the
pleasure
lasts
if
it
hurts
us
our
muscular
contractions
at
the
instant
stop
so
complete
is
the
inhibition
in
this
latter
case
that
it
is
almost
impossible
for
a
man
to
cut
or
mutilate
himself
slowly
and
deliberately
his
hand
invincibly
refusing
to
bring
on
the
pain
and
there
are
many
pleasures
which
when
once
we
have
begun
to
taste
them
make
it
all
but
obligatory
to
keep
up
the
activity
to
which
they
are
due
so
widespread
and
searching
is
this
influence
of
pleasures
and
pains
upon
our
movements
that
a
premature
philosophy
has
decided
that
these
are
our
only
spurs
to
action
and
that
wherever
they
seem
to
be
absent
it
is
only
because
they
are
so
far
on
among
the
images
that
prompt
the
action
that
they
are
overlooked
this
is
a
great
mistake
however
important
as
is
the
influence
of
pleasures
and
pains
upon
our
movements
they
are
far
from
being
our
only
stimuli
with
the
manifestations
of
instinct
and
emotional
expression
for
example
they
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
who
smiles
for
the
pleasure
of
the
smiling
or
frowns
for
the
pleasure
of
the
frown
who
blushes
to
escape
the
discomfort
of
not
blushing
or
who
in
anger
grief
or
fear
is
actuated
to
the
movements
which
he
makes
by
the
pleasures
which
they
yield
in
all
these
cases
the
movements
are
discharged
fatally
by
the
a
which
the
stimulus
exerts
upon
a
nervous
system
framed
to
respond
in
just
that
way
the
objects
of
our
rage
love
or
terror
the
occasions
of
our
tears
and
smiles
whether
they
be
present
to
our
senses
or
whether
they
be
merely
represented
in
idea
have
this
peculiar
sort
of
impulsive
power
the
of
mental
states
is
an
attribute
behind
which
we
can
not
go
some
states
of
mind
have
more
of
it
than
others
some
have
it
in
this
direction
and
some
in
that
feelings
of
pleasure
and
pain
have
it
and
perceptions
and
imaginations
of
fact
have
it
but
neither
have
it
exclusively
or
peculiarly
it
is
of
the
essence
of
all
consciousness
or
of
the
neural
process
which
underlies
it
to
instigate
movement
of
some
sort
that
with
one
creature
and
object
it
should
be
of
one
sort
with
others
of
another
sort
is
a
problem
for
evolutionary
history
to
explain
however
the
actual
impulsions
may
have
arisen
they
must
now
be
described
as
they
exist
and
those
persons
obey
a
curiously
narrow
teleological
superstition
who
think
themselves
bound
to
interpret
them
in
every
instance
as
effects
of
the
secret
solicitancy
of
pleasure
and
repugnancy
of
pain
if
the
thought
of
pleasure
can
impel
to
action
surely
other
thoughts
may
experience
only
can
decide
which
thoughts
do
the
chapters
on
instinct
and
emotion
have
shown
us
that
their
name
is
legion
and
with
this
verdict
we
ought
to
remain
contented
and
not
seek
an
illusory
simplification
at
the
cost
of
half
the
facts
if
in
these
our
acts
pleasures
and
pains
bear
no
part
as
little
do
they
bear
in
our
last
acts
or
those
artificially
acquired
performances
which
have
become
habitual
all
the
daily
routine
of
life
our
dressing
and
undressing
the
coming
and
going
from
our
work
or
carrying
through
of
its
various
operations
is
utterly
without
mental
reference
to
pleasure
and
pain
except
under
rarely
realized
conditions
it
is
action
as
i
do
not
breathe
for
the
pleasure
of
the
breathing
but
simply
find
that
i
breathing
so
i
do
not
write
for
the
pleasure
of
the
writing
but
simply
because
i
have
once
begun
and
being
in
a
state
of
intellectual
excitement
which
keeps
venting
itself
in
that
way
find
that
i
writing
still
who
will
pretend
that
when
he
idly
fingers
his
at
the
table
it
is
for
the
sake
of
any
pleasure
which
it
gives
him
or
pain
which
he
thereby
avoids
we
do
all
these
things
because
at
the
moment
we
can
not
help
it
our
nervous
systems
are
so
shaped
that
they
overflow
in
just
that
way
and
for
many
of
our
idle
or
purely
and
fidgety
performances
we
can
assign
absolutely
no
at
all
or
what
shall
be
said
of
a
shy
and
unsociable
man
who
receives
an
invitation
to
a
small
party
the
thing
is
to
him
an
abomination
but
your
presence
exerts
a
compulsion
on
him
he
can
think
of
no
excuse
and
so
says
yes
cursing
himself
the
while
for
what
he
does
he
is
unusually
who
does
not
every
week
of
his
life
fall
into
some
such
blundering
act
as
this
such
instances
of
show
not
only
that
our
acts
can
not
all
be
conceived
as
effects
of
represented
pleasure
but
that
they
can
not
even
be
classed
as
cases
of
represented
the
class
contains
many
more
generally
influential
motives
to
action
than
the
class
but
almost
as
little
as
under
the
form
of
pleasures
do
our
acts
invariably
appear
to
us
under
the
form
of
all
diseased
impulses
and
pathological
fixed
ideas
are
instances
to
the
contrary
it
is
the
very
badness
of
the
act
that
gives
it
then
its
vertiginous
fascination
remove
the
prohibition
and
the
attraction
stops
in
my
university
days
a
student
threw
himself
from
an
upper
entry
window
of
one
of
the
college
buildings
and
was
nearly
killed
another
student
a
friend
of
my
own
had
to
pass
the
window
daily
in
coming
and
going
from
his
room
and
experienced
a
dreadful
temptation
to
imitate
the
deed
being
a
catholic
he
told
his
director
who
said
right
if
you
must
you
must
and
added
ahead
and
do
it
thereby
instantly
quenching
his
desire
this
director
knew
how
to
minister
to
a
mind
diseased
but
we
need
not
go
to
minds
diseased
for
examples
of
the
occasional
of
simple
badness
and
unpleasantness
as
such
every
one
who
has
a
wound
or
hurt
anywhere
a
sore
tooth
will
ever
and
anon
press
it
just
to
bring
out
the
pain
if
we
are
near
a
new
sort
of
stink
we
must
sniff
it
again
just
to
verify
once
more
how
bad
it
is
this
very
day
i
have
been
repeating
over
and
over
to
myself
a
verbal
jingle
whose
mawkish
silliness
was
the
secret
of
its
haunting
power
i
loathed
yet
could
not
banish
it
holds
attention
determines
if
one
must
have
a
single
name
for
the
condition
upon
which
the
impulsive
and
inhibitive
quality
of
objects
depends
one
had
better
call
it
their
interesting
is
a
title
which
covers
not
only
the
pleasant
and
the
painful
but
also
the
morbidly
fascinating
the
tediously
haunting
and
even
the
simply
habitual
inasmuch
as
the
attention
usually
travels
on
habitual
lines
and
and
are
synonymous
terms
it
seems
as
if
we
ought
to
look
for
the
secret
of
an
idea
impulsiveness
not
in
any
peculiar
relations
which
it
may
have
with
paths
of
motor
discharge
for
ideas
have
relations
with
some
such
paths
but
rather
in
a
preliminary
phenomenon
the
namely
with
which
it
is
able
to
compel
attention
and
dominate
in
let
it
once
so
dominate
let
no
other
ideas
succeed
in
displacing
it
and
whatever
motor
effects
belong
to
it
by
nature
will
inevitably
occur
its
impulsion
in
short
will
be
given
to
boot
and
will
manifest
itself
as
a
matter
of
course
this
is
what
we
have
seen
in
instinct
in
emotion
in
common
action
in
hypnotic
suggestion
in
morbid
impulsion
and
in
the
impelling
idea
is
simply
the
one
which
possesses
the
attention
it
is
the
same
where
pleasure
and
pain
are
the
motor
spurs
they
drive
other
thoughts
from
consciousness
at
the
same
time
that
they
instigate
their
own
characteristic
effects
and
this
is
also
what
happens
at
the
moment
of
the
in
all
the
five
types
of
which
we
have
described
in
short
one
does
not
see
any
case
in
which
the
steadfast
occupancy
of
consciousness
does
not
appear
to
be
the
prime
condition
of
impulsive
power
it
is
still
more
obviously
the
prime
condition
of
inhibitive
power
what
checks
our
impulses
is
the
mere
thinking
of
reasons
to
the
contrary
it
is
their
bare
presence
to
the
mind
which
gives
the
veto
and
makes
acts
otherwise
seductive
impossible
to
perform
if
we
could
only
our
scruples
our
doubts
our
fears
what
exultant
energy
we
should
for
a
while
display
is
a
relation
between
the
mind
and
its
in
closing
in
therefore
after
all
these
preliminaries
upon
the
more
nature
of
the
volitional
process
we
find
ourselves
driven
more
and
more
exclusively
to
consider
the
conditions
which
make
ideas
prevail
in
the
mind
with
the
prevalence
once
there
as
a
fact
of
the
motive
idea
the
of
volition
properly
stops
the
movements
which
ensue
are
exclusively
physiological
phenomena
following
according
to
physiological
laws
upon
the
neural
events
to
which
the
idea
corresponds
the
terminates
with
the
prevalence
of
the
idea
and
whether
the
act
then
follows
or
not
is
a
matter
quite
immaterial
so
far
as
the
willing
itself
goes
i
will
to
write
and
the
act
follows
i
will
to
sneeze
and
it
does
not
i
will
that
the
distant
table
slide
over
the
floor
towards
me
it
also
does
not
my
willing
representation
can
no
more
instigate
my
than
it
can
instigate
the
table
to
activity
but
in
both
cases
it
is
as
true
and
good
willing
as
it
was
when
i
willed
to
write
in
a
word
volition
is
a
psychic
or
moral
fact
pure
and
simple
and
is
absolutely
completed
when
the
stable
state
of
the
idea
is
there
the
supervention
of
motion
is
a
supernumerary
phenomenon
depending
on
executive
ganglia
whose
function
lies
outside
the
mind
if
the
ganglia
work
duly
the
act
occurs
perfectly
if
they
work
but
work
wrongly
we
have
vitus
dance
locomotor
ataxy
motor
aphasia
or
minor
degrees
of
awkwardness
if
they
do
work
at
all
the
act
fails
altogether
and
we
say
the
man
is
paralyzed
he
may
make
a
tremendous
effort
and
contract
the
other
muscles
of
the
body
but
the
paralyzed
limb
fails
to
move
in
all
these
cases
however
the
volition
considered
as
a
psychic
process
is
intact
effort
is
effort
of
we
thus
find
that
reach
the
heart
of
our
inquiry
into
volition
when
we
ask
by
what
process
it
is
that
the
thought
of
any
given
action
comes
to
prevail
stably
in
the
where
thoughts
prevail
without
effort
we
have
sufficiently
studied
in
the
several
chapters
on
sensation
association
and
attention
the
laws
of
their
advent
before
consciousness
and
of
their
stay
we
shall
not
go
over
that
ground
again
for
we
know
that
interest
and
association
are
the
words
let
their
worth
be
what
it
may
on
which
our
explanations
must
perforce
rely
where
on
the
other
hand
the
prevalence
of
the
thought
is
accompanied
by
the
phenomenon
of
effort
the
case
is
much
less
clear
already
in
the
chapter
on
attention
we
postponed
the
final
consideration
of
voluntary
attention
with
effort
to
a
later
place
we
have
now
brought
things
to
a
point
at
which
we
see
that
attention
with
effort
is
all
that
any
case
of
volition
implies
essential
achievement
of
the
will
in
short
when
it
is
most
is
to
attend
to
a
difficult
object
and
hold
it
fast
before
the
the
the
and
it
is
a
mere
physiological
incident
that
when
the
object
is
thus
attended
to
immediate
motor
consequences
should
ensue
of
attention
is
thus
the
essential
phenomenon
of
every
reader
must
know
by
his
own
experience
that
this
is
so
for
every
reader
must
have
felt
some
fiery
passion
grasp
what
constitutes
the
difficulty
for
a
man
laboring
under
an
unwise
passion
of
acting
as
if
the
passion
were
wise
certainly
there
is
no
physical
difficulty
it
is
as
easy
physically
to
avoid
a
fight
as
to
begin
one
to
pocket
money
as
to
squander
it
on
one
cupidities
to
walk
away
from
as
towards
a
coquette
door
the
difficulty
is
mental
it
is
that
of
getting
the
idea
of
the
wise
action
to
stay
before
our
mind
at
all
when
any
strong
emotional
state
whatever
is
upon
us
the
tendency
is
for
no
images
but
such
as
are
congruous
with
it
to
come
up
if
others
by
chance
offer
themselves
they
are
instantly
smothered
and
crowded
out
if
we
be
joyous
we
can
not
keep
thinking
of
those
uncertainties
and
risks
of
failure
which
abound
upon
our
path
if
lugubrious
we
can
not
think
of
new
triumphs
travels
loves
and
joys
nor
if
vengeful
of
our
oppressor
community
of
nature
with
ourselves
the
cooling
advice
which
we
get
from
others
when
the
is
on
us
is
the
most
jarring
and
exasperating
thing
in
life
reply
we
can
not
so
we
get
angry
for
by
a
sort
of
instinct
which
our
passion
has
it
feels
that
these
chill
objects
if
they
once
but
gain
a
lodgment
will
work
and
work
until
they
have
frozen
the
very
vital
spark
from
out
of
all
our
mood
and
brought
our
airy
castles
in
ruin
to
the
ground
such
is
the
inevitable
effect
of
reasonable
ideas
over
others
they
can
once
get
a
quiet
and
passion
cue
accordingly
is
always
and
everywhere
to
prevent
their
still
small
voice
from
being
heard
at
all
let
me
not
think
of
that
do
speak
to
me
of
that
this
is
the
sudden
cry
of
all
those
who
in
a
passion
perceive
some
sobering
considerations
about
to
check
them
in
there
is
something
so
icy
in
this
bath
something
which
seems
so
hostile
to
the
movement
of
our
life
so
purely
negative
in
reason
when
she
lays
her
finger
on
our
heart
and
says
halt
give
up
leave
off
go
back
sit
down
that
it
is
no
wonder
that
to
most
men
the
steadying
influence
seems
for
the
time
being
a
very
minister
of
death
the
man
however
is
the
man
who
hears
the
still
small
voice
unflinchingly
and
who
when
the
consideration
comes
looks
at
its
face
consents
to
its
presence
clings
to
it
affirms
it
and
holds
it
fast
in
spite
of
the
host
of
exciting
mental
images
which
rise
in
revolt
against
it
and
would
expel
it
from
the
mind
sustained
in
this
way
by
a
resolute
effort
of
attention
the
difficult
object
erelong
begins
to
call
up
its
own
congeners
and
associates
and
ends
by
changing
the
disposition
of
the
man
consciousness
altogether
and
with
his
consciousness
his
action
changes
for
the
new
object
once
stably
in
possession
of
the
field
of
his
thoughts
infallibly
produces
its
own
motor
effects
the
difficulty
lies
in
the
gaining
possession
of
that
field
though
the
spontaneous
drift
of
thought
is
all
the
other
way
the
attention
must
be
kept
strained
on
that
one
object
until
at
last
it
so
as
to
maintain
itself
before
the
mind
with
ease
this
strain
of
the
attention
is
the
fundamental
act
of
will
and
the
will
work
is
in
most
cases
practically
ended
when
the
bare
presence
to
our
thought
of
the
naturally
unwelcome
object
has
been
secured
for
the
mysterious
tie
between
the
thought
and
the
motor
centres
next
comes
into
play
and
in
a
way
which
we
can
not
even
guess
at
the
obedience
of
the
bodily
organs
follows
as
a
matter
of
course
in
all
this
one
sees
how
the
immediate
point
of
application
of
the
volitional
effort
lies
exclusively
in
the
mental
world
the
whole
drama
is
a
mental
drama
the
whole
difficulty
is
a
mental
difficulty
a
difficulty
with
an
ideal
object
of
our
thought
it
is
in
one
word
an
to
which
our
will
applies
itself
an
idea
which
if
we
let
it
go
would
slip
away
but
which
we
will
not
let
go
to
the
undivided
presence
this
is
effort
sole
its
only
function
is
to
get
this
feeling
of
consent
into
the
mind
and
for
this
there
is
but
one
way
the
idea
to
be
consented
to
must
be
kept
from
flickering
and
going
out
it
must
be
held
steadily
before
the
mind
until
it
the
mind
such
filling
of
the
mind
by
an
idea
with
its
congruous
associates
consent
to
the
idea
and
to
the
fact
which
the
idea
represents
if
the
idea
be
that
or
include
that
of
a
bodily
movement
of
our
own
then
we
call
the
consent
thus
laboriously
gained
a
motor
volition
for
nature
here
us
instantaneously
and
follows
up
our
inward
willingness
by
outward
changes
on
her
own
part
she
does
this
in
no
other
instance
pity
she
should
not
have
been
more
generous
nor
made
a
world
whose
other
parts
were
as
immediately
subject
to
our
will
on
page
in
describing
the
type
of
decision
it
was
said
that
it
usually
came
when
the
right
conception
of
the
case
was
found
where
however
the
right
conception
is
an
one
the
whole
intellectual
ingenuity
of
the
man
usually
goes
to
work
to
crowd
it
out
of
sight
and
to
find
for
the
emergency
names
by
the
help
of
which
the
dispositions
of
the
moment
may
sound
sanctified
and
sloth
or
passion
may
reign
unchecked
how
many
excuses
does
the
drunkard
find
when
each
new
temptation
comes
it
is
a
new
brand
of
liquor
which
the
interests
of
intellectual
culture
in
such
matters
oblige
him
to
test
moreover
it
is
poured
out
and
it
is
sin
to
waste
it
also
others
are
drinking
and
it
would
be
churlishness
to
refuse
or
it
is
but
to
enable
him
to
sleep
or
just
to
get
through
this
job
of
work
or
it
drinking
it
is
because
he
feels
so
cold
or
it
is
or
it
is
a
means
of
stimulating
him
to
make
a
more
powerful
resolution
in
favor
of
abstinence
than
any
he
has
hitherto
made
or
it
is
just
this
once
and
once
does
count
it
is
in
fact
anything
you
like
except
a
is
the
conception
that
will
not
stay
before
the
poor
soul
attention
but
if
he
once
gets
able
to
pick
out
that
way
of
conceiving
from
all
the
other
possible
ways
of
conceiving
the
various
opportunities
which
occur
if
through
thick
and
thin
he
holds
to
it
that
this
is
being
a
drunkard
and
is
nothing
else
he
is
not
likely
to
remain
one
long
the
effort
by
which
he
succeeds
in
keeping
the
right
unwaveringly
present
to
his
mind
proves
to
be
his
saving
moral
act
everywhere
then
the
function
of
the
effort
is
the
same
to
keep
affirming
and
adopting
a
thought
which
if
left
to
itself
would
slip
away
it
may
be
cold
and
flat
when
the
spontaneous
mental
drift
is
towards
excitement
or
great
and
arduous
when
the
spontaneous
drift
is
towards
repose
in
the
one
case
the
effort
has
to
inhibit
an
explosive
in
the
other
to
arouse
an
obstructed
will
the
exhausted
sailor
on
a
wreck
has
a
will
which
is
obstructed
one
of
his
ideas
is
that
of
his
sore
hands
of
the
nameless
exhaustion
of
his
whole
frame
which
the
act
of
farther
pumping
involves
and
of
the
deliciousness
of
sinking
into
sleep
the
other
is
that
of
the
hungry
sea
ingulfing
him
rather
the
aching
toil
he
says
and
it
becomes
reality
then
in
spite
of
the
inhibiting
influence
of
the
relatively
luxurious
sensations
which
he
gets
from
lying
still
often
again
it
may
be
the
thought
of
sleep
and
what
leads
to
it
which
is
the
hard
one
to
keep
before
the
mind
if
a
patient
afflicted
with
insomnia
can
only
control
the
whirling
chase
of
his
ideas
so
far
as
to
think
of
at
which
can
be
done
or
so
far
as
to
imagine
one
letter
after
another
of
a
verse
of
scripture
or
poetry
spelt
slowly
and
monotonously
out
it
is
almost
certain
that
here
too
specific
bodily
effects
will
follow
and
that
sleep
will
come
the
trouble
is
to
keep
the
mind
upon
a
train
of
objects
naturally
so
insipid
sustain
a
representation
to
is
in
short
the
only
moral
act
for
the
impulsive
and
the
obstructed
for
sane
and
lunatics
alike
most
maniacs
know
their
thoughts
to
be
crazy
but
find
them
too
pressing
to
be
withstood
compared
with
them
the
sane
truths
are
so
deadly
sober
so
cadaverous
that
the
lunatic
can
not
bear
to
look
them
in
the
face
and
say
let
these
alone
be
my
reality
but
with
sufficient
effort
as
wigan
says
such
a
man
can
for
a
time
himself
as
it
were
and
determine
that
the
notions
of
the
disordered
brain
shall
not
be
manifested
many
instances
are
on
record
similar
to
that
told
by
pinel
where
an
inmate
of
the
bicÃªtre
having
stood
a
long
and
given
every
mark
of
restored
reason
signed
his
name
to
the
paper
authorizing
his
discharge
christ
and
then
went
off
into
all
the
vagaries
connected
with
that
delusion
in
the
phraseology
of
the
gentleman
whose
case
is
related
in
an
early
part
of
this
wigan
work
he
had
himself
tight
during
the
examination
in
order
to
attain
his
object
this
once
accomplished
he
himself
down
again
and
if
even
of
his
delusion
could
not
control
it
i
have
observed
with
such
persons
that
it
requires
a
considerable
time
to
wind
themselves
up
to
the
pitch
of
complete
that
the
effort
is
a
painful
tension
of
the
mind
when
thrown
off
their
guard
by
any
accidental
remark
or
worn
out
by
the
length
of
the
examination
they
themselves
and
can
not
gather
themselves
up
again
without
preparation
to
sum
it
all
up
in
a
word
terminus
of
the
psychological
process
in
volition
the
point
to
which
the
will
is
directly
applied
is
always
an
there
are
at
all
times
some
ideas
from
which
we
shy
away
like
frightened
horses
the
moment
we
get
a
glimpse
of
their
forbidding
profile
upon
the
threshold
of
our
thought
only
resistance
which
our
will
can
possibly
experience
is
the
resistance
which
such
an
idea
offers
to
being
attended
to
at
to
attend
to
it
is
the
volitional
act
and
the
only
inward
volitional
act
which
we
ever
perform
question
of
as
was
remarked
on
in
the
experience
of
effort
we
feel
as
if
we
might
make
more
or
less
than
we
actually
at
any
moment
are
making
the
effort
appears
in
other
words
not
as
a
fixed
reaction
on
our
part
which
the
object
that
resists
us
necessarily
calls
forth
but
as
what
the
mathematicians
call
an
variable
amongst
the
fixed
data
of
the
case
our
motives
character
etc
if
it
be
really
so
if
the
amount
of
our
effort
is
not
a
determinate
function
of
those
other
data
then
in
common
parlance
wills
are
if
on
the
contrary
the
amount
of
effort
be
a
fixed
function
so
that
whatever
object
at
any
time
fills
our
consciousness
was
from
eternity
bound
to
fill
it
then
and
there
and
compel
from
us
the
exact
effort
neither
more
nor
less
which
we
bestow
upon
it
then
our
wills
are
not
free
and
all
our
acts
are
foreordained
question
of
fact
in
the
controversy
is
thus
extremely
simple
it
relates
solely
to
the
amount
of
effort
of
attention
which
we
can
at
any
time
put
are
the
duration
and
intensity
of
this
effort
fixed
functions
of
the
object
or
are
they
not
now
as
i
just
said
it
as
if
we
might
exert
more
or
less
in
any
given
case
when
a
man
has
let
his
thoughts
go
for
days
and
weeks
until
at
last
they
culminate
in
some
particularly
dirty
or
cowardly
or
cruel
act
it
is
hard
to
persuade
him
in
the
midst
of
his
remorse
that
he
might
not
have
reined
them
in
hard
to
make
him
believe
that
this
whole
goodly
universe
which
his
act
so
jars
upon
required
and
exacted
it
of
him
at
that
fatal
moment
and
from
eternity
made
aught
else
impossible
but
on
the
other
hand
there
is
the
certainty
that
all
his
volitions
are
resultants
of
interests
and
associations
whose
strength
and
sequence
are
mechanically
determined
by
the
structure
of
that
physical
mass
his
brain
and
the
general
continuity
of
things
and
the
monistic
conception
of
the
world
may
lead
one
irresistibly
to
postulate
that
a
little
fact
like
effort
can
form
no
real
exception
to
the
overwhelming
reign
of
deterministic
law
even
in
effortless
volition
we
have
the
consciousness
of
the
alternative
being
also
possible
this
is
surely
a
delusion
here
why
is
it
not
a
delusion
everywhere
fact
is
that
the
question
of
is
insoluble
on
strictly
psychologic
after
a
certain
amount
of
effort
of
attention
has
been
given
to
an
idea
it
is
manifestly
impossible
to
tell
whether
either
more
or
less
of
it
have
been
given
or
not
to
tell
that
we
should
have
to
ascend
to
the
antecedents
of
the
effort
and
defining
them
with
mathematical
exactitude
prove
by
laws
of
which
we
have
not
at
present
even
an
inkling
that
the
only
amount
of
sequent
effort
which
could
comport
with
them
was
the
precise
amount
that
actually
came
such
measurements
whether
of
psychic
or
of
neural
quantities
and
such
deductive
reasonings
as
this
method
of
proof
implies
will
surely
be
forever
beyond
human
reach
no
serious
psychologist
or
physiologist
will
venture
even
to
suggest
a
notion
of
how
they
might
be
practically
made
had
one
no
motives
drawn
from
elsewhere
to
make
one
partial
to
either
solution
one
might
easily
leave
the
matter
undecided
but
a
psychologist
can
not
be
expected
to
be
thus
impartial
having
a
great
motive
in
favor
of
determinism
he
wants
to
build
a
and
a
science
is
a
system
of
fixed
relations
wherever
there
are
independent
variables
there
science
stops
so
far
then
as
our
volitions
may
be
independent
variables
a
scientific
psychology
must
ignore
that
fact
and
treat
of
them
only
so
far
as
they
are
fixed
functions
in
other
words
she
must
deal
with
the
of
volition
exclusively
with
the
impulsive
and
inhibitory
character
of
ideas
with
the
nature
of
their
appeals
to
the
attention
with
the
conditions
under
which
effort
may
arise
etc
but
not
with
the
precise
amounts
of
effort
for
these
if
our
wills
be
free
are
impossible
to
compute
she
thus
abstracts
from
without
necessarily
denying
its
existence
practically
however
such
abstraction
is
not
distinguished
from
rejection
and
most
actual
psychologists
have
no
hesitation
in
denying
that
exists
for
ourselves
we
can
hand
the
controversy
over
to
metaphysics
psychology
will
surely
never
grow
refined
enough
to
discover
in
the
case
of
any
individual
decision
a
discrepancy
between
her
scientific
calculations
and
the
fact
her
prevision
will
never
foretell
whether
the
effort
be
completely
predestinate
or
not
the
way
in
which
each
individual
emergency
is
resolved
psychology
will
be
psychology
and
science
science
as
much
as
ever
as
much
and
no
more
in
this
world
whether
be
true
in
it
or
not
we
can
thus
ignore
the
question
in
psychology
as
we
said
on
the
operation
of
free
effort
if
it
existed
could
only
be
to
hold
some
one
ideal
object
or
part
of
an
object
a
little
longer
or
a
little
more
intensely
before
the
mind
amongst
the
alternatives
which
present
themselves
as
it
would
thus
make
one
effective
and
although
such
quickening
of
one
idea
might
be
morally
and
historically
momentous
yet
if
considered
it
would
be
an
operation
amongst
those
physiological
infinitesimals
which
an
actual
science
must
forever
neglect
importance
of
the
phenomenon
of
but
whilst
eliminating
the
question
about
the
amount
of
our
effort
as
one
which
psychology
will
never
have
a
practical
call
to
decide
i
must
say
one
word
about
the
extraordinarily
intimate
and
important
character
which
the
phenomenon
of
effort
assumes
in
our
own
eyes
as
individual
men
of
course
we
measure
ourselves
by
many
standards
our
strength
and
our
intelligence
our
wealth
and
even
our
good
luck
are
things
which
warm
our
heart
and
make
us
feel
ourselves
a
match
for
life
but
deeper
than
all
such
things
and
able
to
suffice
unto
itself
without
them
is
the
sense
of
the
amount
of
effort
which
we
can
put
forth
those
are
after
all
but
effects
products
and
reflections
of
the
outer
world
within
but
the
effort
seems
to
belong
to
an
altogether
different
realm
as
if
it
were
the
substantive
thing
which
we
and
those
were
but
externals
which
we
if
the
of
our
heart
and
reins
be
the
purpose
of
this
human
drama
then
what
is
sought
seems
to
be
what
effort
we
can
make
he
who
can
make
none
is
but
a
shadow
he
who
can
make
much
is
a
hero
the
huge
world
that
girdles
us
about
puts
all
sorts
of
questions
to
us
and
tests
us
in
all
sorts
of
ways
some
of
the
tests
we
meet
by
actions
that
are
easy
and
some
of
the
questions
we
answer
in
articulately
formulated
words
but
the
deepest
question
that
is
ever
asked
admits
of
no
reply
but
the
dumb
turning
of
the
will
and
tightening
of
our
as
we
say
i
will
even
have
it
so
when
a
dreadful
object
is
presented
or
when
life
as
a
whole
turns
up
its
dark
abysses
to
our
view
then
the
worthless
ones
among
us
lose
their
hold
on
the
situation
altogether
and
either
escape
from
its
difficulties
by
averting
their
attention
or
if
they
can
not
do
that
collapse
into
yielding
masses
of
plaintiveness
and
fear
the
effort
required
for
facing
and
consenting
to
such
objects
is
beyond
their
power
to
make
but
the
heroic
mind
does
differently
to
it
too
the
objects
are
sinister
and
dreadful
unwelcome
incompatible
with
things
but
it
can
face
them
if
necessary
without
for
that
losing
its
hold
upon
the
rest
of
life
the
world
thus
finds
in
the
heroic
man
its
worthy
match
and
mate
and
the
effort
which
he
is
able
to
put
forth
to
hold
himself
erect
and
keep
his
heart
unshaken
is
the
direct
measure
of
his
worth
and
function
in
the
game
of
human
life
he
can
this
universe
he
can
meet
it
and
keep
up
his
faith
in
it
in
presence
of
those
same
features
which
lay
his
weaker
brethren
low
he
can
still
find
a
zest
in
it
not
by
forgetfulness
but
by
pure
inward
willingness
to
face
it
with
those
deterrent
objects
there
and
hereby
he
makes
himself
one
of
the
masters
and
the
lords
of
life
he
must
be
counted
with
henceforth
he
forms
a
part
of
human
destiny
neither
in
the
theoretic
nor
in
the
practical
sphere
do
we
care
for
or
go
for
help
to
those
who
have
no
head
for
risks
or
sense
for
living
on
the
perilous
edge
our
religious
life
lies
more
our
practical
life
lies
less
than
it
used
to
on
the
perilous
edge
but
just
as
our
courage
is
so
often
a
reflex
of
another
courage
so
our
faith
is
apt
to
be
a
faith
in
some
one
faith
we
draw
new
life
from
the
heroic
example
the
prophet
has
drunk
more
deeply
than
anyone
of
the
cup
of
bitterness
but
his
countenance
is
so
unshaken
and
he
speaks
such
mighty
words
of
cheer
that
his
will
becomes
our
will
and
our
life
is
kindled
at
his
own
thus
not
only
our
morality
but
our
religion
so
far
as
the
latter
is
deliberate
depend
on
the
effort
which
we
can
make
you
or
you
have
it
so
is
the
most
probing
question
we
are
ever
asked
we
are
asked
it
every
hour
of
the
day
and
about
the
largest
as
well
as
the
smallest
the
most
theoretical
as
well
as
the
most
practical
things
we
answer
by
or
and
not
by
words
what
wonder
that
these
dumb
responses
should
seem
our
deepest
organs
of
communication
with
the
nature
of
things
what
wonder
if
the
effort
demanded
by
them
be
the
measure
of
our
worth
as
men
what
wonder
if
the
amount
which
we
accord
of
it
were
the
one
strictly
underived
and
original
contribution
which
we
make
to
the
world
epilogue
psychology
and
philosophy
the
word
metaphysics
in
the
last
chapter
we
handed
the
question
of
over
to
it
would
indeed
have
been
hasty
to
settle
the
question
absolutely
inside
the
limits
of
psychology
let
psychology
frankly
admit
that
her
scientific
determinism
may
be
and
no
one
can
find
fault
if
then
it
turn
out
later
that
the
claim
has
only
a
relative
purpose
and
may
be
crossed
by
the
readjustment
can
be
made
now
ethics
makes
a
counterclaim
and
the
present
writer
for
one
has
no
hesitation
in
regarding
her
claim
as
the
stronger
and
in
assuming
that
our
wills
are
for
him
then
the
deterministic
assumption
of
psychology
is
merely
provisional
and
methodological
this
is
no
place
to
argue
the
ethical
point
and
i
only
mention
the
conflict
to
show
that
all
these
special
sciences
marked
off
for
convenience
from
the
remaining
body
of
truth
cf
must
hold
their
assumptions
and
results
subject
to
revision
in
the
light
of
each
others
needs
the
forum
where
they
hold
discussion
is
called
metaphysics
metaphysics
means
only
an
unusually
obstinate
attempt
to
think
clearly
and
consistently
the
special
sciences
all
deal
with
data
that
are
full
of
obscurity
and
contradiction
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
their
limited
purposes
these
defects
may
be
overlooked
hence
the
disparaging
use
of
the
name
metaphysics
which
is
so
common
to
a
man
with
a
limited
purpose
any
discussion
that
is
for
that
purpose
is
branded
as
a
geologist
purposes
fall
short
of
understanding
time
itself
a
mechanist
need
not
know
how
action
and
reaction
are
possible
at
all
a
psychologist
has
enough
to
do
without
asking
how
both
he
and
the
mind
which
he
studies
are
able
to
take
cognizance
of
the
same
outer
world
but
it
is
obvious
that
problems
irrelevant
from
one
standpoint
may
be
essential
from
another
and
as
soon
as
one
purpose
is
the
attainment
of
the
maximum
of
possible
insight
into
the
world
as
a
whole
the
metaphysical
puzzles
become
the
most
urgent
ones
of
all
psychology
contributes
to
general
philosophy
her
full
share
of
these
and
i
propose
in
this
last
chapter
to
indicate
briefly
which
of
them
seem
the
more
important
and
first
of
the
of
consciousness
to
the
when
psychology
is
treated
as
a
natural
science
after
the
fashion
in
which
it
has
been
treated
in
this
book
of
mind
are
taken
for
granted
as
data
immediately
given
in
experience
and
the
working
hypothesis
see
is
the
mere
empirical
law
that
to
the
entire
state
of
the
brain
at
any
moment
one
unique
state
of
mind
always
this
does
very
well
till
we
begin
to
be
metaphysical
and
ask
ourselves
just
what
we
mean
by
such
a
word
as
this
notion
appears
dark
in
the
extreme
the
moment
we
seek
to
translate
it
into
something
more
intimate
than
mere
parallel
variation
some
think
they
make
the
notion
of
it
clearer
by
calling
the
mental
state
and
the
brain
the
inner
and
outer
respectively
of
and
the
same
reality
others
consider
the
mental
state
as
the
of
a
unitary
being
the
soul
upon
the
multiple
activities
which
the
brain
presents
others
again
comminute
the
mystery
by
supposing
each
to
be
separately
conscious
and
the
empirically
given
mental
state
to
be
the
appearance
of
all
the
little
consciousnesses
fused
into
one
just
as
the
itself
is
the
appearance
of
all
the
cells
together
when
looked
at
from
one
point
of
view
we
may
call
these
three
metaphysical
attempts
the
the
and
the
theories
respectively
each
has
its
difficulties
of
which
it
seems
to
me
that
those
of
the
spiritualistic
theory
are
much
the
least
grave
but
the
spiritualistic
theory
is
quite
out
of
touch
with
the
facts
of
multiple
consciousness
alternate
personality
etc
pp
these
lend
themselves
more
naturally
to
the
atomistic
formulation
for
it
seems
easier
to
think
of
a
lot
of
minor
consciousnesses
now
gathering
together
into
one
large
mass
and
now
into
several
smaller
ones
than
of
a
soul
now
reacting
totally
now
breaking
into
several
disconnected
simultaneous
reactions
the
localization
of
also
makes
for
the
atomistic
view
if
in
my
experience
say
of
a
bell
it
is
my
occipital

which
are

what
is
more
natural
than
to
say
that
the
former
it
and
the
latter
it
and
then
their
information
in
view
of
the
extreme
naturalness
of
such
a
way
of
representing
the
fact
that
the
appearance
of
the
several
parts
of
an
object
to
consciousness
at
any
moment
does
depend
on
as
many
several
parts
of
the
brain
being
then
active
all
such
objections
as
were
urged
on
pp
and
elsewhere
to
the
notion
that
of
consciousness
will
be
rejected
as
unreal
and
by
the
atomistic
philosopher
his
is
to
gain
a
formula
which
shall
unify
things
in
a
natural
and
easy
manner
and
for
such
a
purpose
the
atomistic
theory
seems
expressly
made
to
his
hand
but
the
difficulty
with
the
problem
of
is
not
only
that
of
solving
it
it
is
that
of
even
stating
it
in
elementary
terms
en

toute
before
we
can
know
just
what
sort
of
occur
when
thought
corresponds
to
a
change
in
the
brain
we
must
know
the
of
the
we
must
know
which
sort
of
mental
fact
and
which
sort
of
cerebral
fact
are
so
to
speak
in
immediate
juxtaposition
we
must
find
the
minimal
mental
fact
whose
being
reposes
directly
on
a
and
we
must
similarly
find
the
minimal
which
can
have
a
mental
counterpart
at
all
between
the
mental
and
the
physical
minima
thus
found
there
will
be
an
immediate
relation
the
expression
of
which
if
we
had
it
would
be
the
elementary
law
our
own
formula
has
escaped
the
metempiric
assumption
of
psychic
atoms
by
the
entire
even
of
a
complex
object
the
minimum
with
which
it
deals
on
the
side
and
the
entire
brain
as
the
minimum
on
the
physical
side
but
the
brain
is
not
a
physical
fact
at
all
it
is
nothing
but
our
name
for
the
way
in
which
a
billion
of
molecules
arranged
in
certain
positions
may
affect
our
sense
on
the
principles
of
the
corpuscular
or
mechanical
philosophy
the
only
realities
are
the
separate
molecules
or
at
most
the
cells
their
aggregation
into
a
is
a
fiction
of
popular
speech
such
a
figment
can
not
serve
as
the
objectively
real
counterpart
to
any
psychic
state
whatever
only
a
genuinely
physical
fact
can
so
serve
and
the
molecular
fact
is
the
only
genuine
physical
fact
whereupon
we
seem
if
we
are
to
have
an
elementary
law
at
all
thrust
right
back
upon
something
like
the
for
the
molecular
fact
being
an
element
of
the
would
seem
naturally
to
correspond
not
to
total
thoughts
but
to
elements
of
thoughts
thus
the
real
in
psychics
seems
to
to
the
unreal
in
physics
and
and
our
perplexity
is
extreme
relation
of
states
of
mind
to
their
the
perplexity
is
not
diminished
when
we
reflect
upon
our
assumption
that
states
of
consciousness
can
pp
from
the
point
of
view
which
is
that
of
all
the
natural
sciences
knowledge
is
an
ultimate
relation
between
two
mutually
external
entities
the
knower
and
the
known
the
world
first
exists
and
then
the
states
of
mind
and
these
gain
a
cognizance
of
the
world
which
gets
gradually
more
and
more
complete
but
it
is
hard
to
carry
through
this
simple
dualism
for
idealistic
reflections
will
intrude
take
the
states
of
mind
called
pure
sensations
so
far
as
such
may
exist
that
for
example
of
which
we
may
get
from
looking
into
the
zenith
on
a
clear
day
is
the
blue
a
determination
of
the
feeling
itself
or
of
its
shall
we
describe
the
experience
as
a
quality
of
our
feeling
or
as
our
feeling
of
a
quality
ordinary
speech
vacillates
incessantly
on
this
point
the
ambiguous
word
has
been
recently
invented
instead
of
to
escape
a
decision
for
suggests
something
not
exactly
out
of
the
feeling
nor
yet
exactly
identical
with
the
feeling
since
the
latter
remains
suggested
as
the
container
or
vessel
yet
of
our
feelings
as
vessels
apart
from
their
content
we
really
have
no
clear
notion
whatever
the
fact
is
that
such
an
experience
as
as
it
is
immediately
given
can
only
be
called
by
some
such
neutral
name
as
that
of
it
does
not
to
us
as
a
relation
between
two
realities
one
mental
and
one
physical
it
is
only
when
still
thinking
of
it
as
the
blue
cf
we
trace
relations
between
it
and
other
things
that
it
doubles
itself
so
to
speak
and
develops
in
two
directions
and
taken
in
connection
with
some
associates
figures
as
a
physical
quality
whilst
with
others
it
figures
as
a
feeling
in
the
mind
our
or
conceptual
states
of
mind
on
the
other
hand
seem
to
obey
a
different
law
they
present
themselves
immediately
as
referring
beyond
themselves
although
they
also
possess
an
immediately
given
they
have
a
beyond
it
and
claim
to
something
else
than
it
the
we
have
just
spoken
of
for
instance
was
substantively
considered
a
but
it
was
a
word
with
a
the
quality
blue
was
the
of
the
thought
the
word
was
its
the
mental
state
in
short
was
not
as
sensations
are
but
expressly
pointed
at
something
more
in
which
it
meant
to
terminate
but
the
moment
when
as
in
sensations
object
and
conscious
state
seem
to
be
different
ways
of
considering
one
and
the
same
fact
it
becomes
hard
to
justify
our
denial
that
mental
states
consist
of
parts
the
blue
sky
considered
physically
is
a
sum
of
mutually
external
parts
why
is
it
not
such
a
sum
when
considered
as
a
content
of
sensation
the
only
result
that
is
plain
from
all
this
is
that
the
relations
of
the
known
and
the
knower
are
infinitely
complicated
and
that
a
genial
way
of
formulating
them
will
not
suffice
the
only
possible
path
to
understanding
them
lies
through
metaphysical
subtlety
and
idealism
and
must
say
their
say
before
the
assumption
that
thoughts
things
grows
clear
changing
character
of
presents
another
puzzle
we
first
assumed
conscious
as
the
units
with
which
psychology
deals
and
we
said
later
that
they
were
in
constant
change
yet
any
state
must
have
a
certain
duration
to
be
at
all
a
pain
which
lasted
but
a
hundredth
of
a
second
would
practically
be
no
pain
and
the
question
comes
up
how
long
may
a
state
last
and
still
be
treated
as
state
in
for
example
if
the
as
known
the
present
as
we
called
it
may
be
a
dozen
seconds
long
how
long
need
the
present
as
knower
be
that
is
what
is
the
minimum
duration
of
the
consciousness
in
which
those
twelve
seconds
can
be
apprehended
as
just
past
the
minimum
which
can
be
called
a
for
such
a
cognitive
purpose
consciousness
as
a
process
in
time
offers
the
paradoxes
which
have
been
found
in
all
continuous
change
there
are
no
in
such
a
thing
any
more
than
there
are
facets
in
a
circle
or
places
where
an
arrow
when
it
flies
the
vertical
raised
upon
the
on
which
we
represented
the
past
to
be
at
any
given
instant
of
memory
is
only
an
ideal
construction
yet
anything
broader
than
that
vertical
not
for
the
present
is
only
the
joint
between
the
past
and
future
and
has
no
breadth
of
its
own
where
everything
is
change
and
process
how
can
we
talk
of
yet
how
can
we
do
without
in
describing
what
the
vehicles
of
our
knowledge
seem
to
be
of
consciousness
themselves
are
not
verifiable
but
remains
behind
neither
nor
psychology
so
far
as
it
has
yet
been
written
has
ever
doubted
that
the
states
of
consciousness
which
that
science
studies
are
immediate
data
of
experience
have
been
doubted
but
thoughts
and
feelings
have
never
been
doubted
the
outer
world
but
never
the
inner
world
has
been
denied
everyone
assumes
that
we
have
direct
introspective
acquaintance
with
our
thinking
activity
as
such
with
our
consciousness
as
something
inward
and
contrasted
with
the
outer
objects
which
it
knows
yet
i
must
confess
that
for
my
part
i
can
not
feel
sure
of
this
conclusion
whenever
i
try
to
become
sensible
of
my
thinking
activity
as
such
what
i
catch
is
some
bodily
fact
an
impression
coming
from
my
brow
or
head
or
throat
or
nose
it
seems
as
if
consciousness
as
an
inner
activity
were
rather
a
than
a
sensibly
given
fact
the
postulate
namely
of
a
as
correlative
to
all
this
known
and
as
if
might
be
a
better
word
by
which
to
describe
it
but
postulated
as
an
hypothesis
is
practically
a
very
different
thing
from
of
consciousness
apprehended
with
infallible
certainty
by
an
inner
sense
for
one
thing
it
throws
the
question
of
the
knower
really
wide
open
again
and
makes
the
answer
which
we
gave
to
it
at
the
end
of
chapter
xii
a
mere
provisional
statement
from
a
popular
and
prejudiced
point
of
view
when
then
we
talk
of
as
a
natural
science
we
must
not
assume
that
that
means
a
sort
of
psychology
that
stands
at
last
on
solid
ground
it
means
just
the
reverse
it
means
a
psychology
particularly
fragile
and
into
which
the
waters
of
metaphysical
criticism
leak
at
every
joint
a
psychology
all
of
whose
elementary
assumptions
and
data
must
be
reconsidered
in
wider
connections
and
translated
into
other
terms
it
is
in
short
a
phrase
of
diffidence
and
not
of
arrogance
and
it
is
indeed
strange
to
hear
people
talk
triumphantly
of
new
psychology
and
write
of
psychology
when
into
the
real
elements
and
forces
which
the
word
covers
not
the
first
glimpse
of
clear
insight
exists
a
string
of
raw
facts
a
little
gossip
and
wrangle
about
opinions
a
little
classification
and
generalization
on
the
mere
descriptive
level
a
strong
prejudice
that
we
states
of
mind
and
that
our
brain
conditions
them
but
not
a
single
law
in
the
sense
in
which
physics
shows
us
laws
not
a
single
proposition
from
which
any
consequence
can
causally
be
deduced
we
do
even
know
the
terms
between
which
the
elementary
laws
would
obtain
if
we
had
them
this
is
no
science
it
is
only
the
hope
of
a
science
the
matter
of
a
science
is
with
us
something
definite
happens
when
to
a
certain
a
certain
corresponds
a
genuine
glimpse
into
what
it
is
would
be
scientific
achievement
before
which
all
past
achievements
would
pale

at
present
psychology

in
the
condition
of
physics
before
galileo
and
the
laws
of
motion
of
chemistry
before
lavoisier

the

that
i
have
obeyed
custom
and
put
that
subject
first
although
by
no
means
persuaded
that
such
order
intrinsically
is
the
best
i
feel
now
when
it
is
too
late
for
the
change
to
be
made
that
the
chapters
on
the
production
of
motion
on
instinct
and
on
emotion
ought
for
purposes
of
teaching
to
follow
immediately
upon
that
on
habit
and
that
the
chapter
on

ought
to
come
in
very
early
perhaps
immediately
after
that
upon
the
self
i
advise
teachers
to
adopt
this
modified
order
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
with
the
change
of
place
of
there
ought
properly
to
go
a
slight
amount
of
the
subject
may
feel
however
in

it
must
be
admitted
that
of

terminal

excitable

by

the

that

upon

the

the

with

examine

appears
as
a

line
when
with

the

far
forward
as
it
will
go

parts
that
cling

observe
the

around

and
radiating
outside
of
it
the
marks
made
by
the
ciliary
processes
before
they
were
torn
away

a
fine

tube
may
now
be
used
to
insufflate
the
clear
ring
just
below
the

thus
to
reveal

itself
all
these
parts

one
hardened

this

otherwise
would
give

ten

on

an
thick
black
line
is
drawn
the
tubes
can
be
looked
through
one
by
each
eye
and
held
either
parallel
or
with
their
farther
ends
converging
when
properly

of
is
not
an
addition
but
rather
as
helmholtz
has
shown
a
subtraction
of
lights
to
one
color
to
another
we
must
either
by
appropriate
glasses
throw
differently
colored
beams
upon
the
same
reflecting
surface
or
we
must
let
the
eye
look
at
one
color
through
an
inclined
plate
of
glass
beneath
which
it
lies
whilst
the
upper
surface
of
the
glass
reflects
into
the
same
eye
another
color
placed
alongside
the
two
lights
then
mix
on
the
retina
or
finally
we
must
let
the
differently
colored
lights
fall
in
succession
upon
the
retina
so
fast
that
the
second
is
there
before
the
impression
made
by
the
first
has

this
is

done

the
great
maxim
in
pedagogy
is
to
knit
every
new
piece
of
knowledge
on
to
a
preÃ«xisting
curiosity
to
assimilate
its
matter
in
some
way
to
what
is
already

the
advantage
of
comparing
all
that
is
far
off
and
foreign
to
something
that
is
near
home
of
making
the
unknown
plain

the
example
of
the

of

all
the
instruction
with
the

this

pure

must
be
carefully
distinguished
from
the
effort
with
which
it
is
usually
confounded
the
latter
consists
of
all
those
peripheral
feelings
to
which
a
muscular
may
give

these
feelings
whenever
they
are

thus
that

its

stably
representing
their
reality
and
consequently
bringing
it
about
that
they
happen
to
be
made
real
by

activity
is
a
purely
accidental
circumstance
