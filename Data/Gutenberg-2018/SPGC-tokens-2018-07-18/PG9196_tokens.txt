the
clockmaker
or
the
sayings
and
doings
of
samuel
slick
of
slickville
by
thomas
chandler
haliburton
advertisement
from
the
edition
the
name
sam
slick
has
passed
into
popular
use
as
standing
for
a
somewhat
conventional
yankee
in
whom
sharpness
and
verdancy
are
combined
in
curious
proportions
but
the
book
which
gave
rise
to
the
name
has
long
been
out
of
print
it
is
now
revived
under
the
impression
that
the
reading
public
will
have
an
interest
in
seeing
a
work
which
more
probably
than
any
other
one
book
served
to
fix
the
prevailing
idea
of
the
yankee
character
however
true
or
false
the
impression
it
created
the
qualities
which
rendered
it
popular
a
generation
ago
remain
in
a
shrewdness
of
observation
a
fund
of
anecdote
and
racy
adventure
a
quaintness
of
expression
and
keen
mother
wit
in
no
other
work
of
literature
is
there
preserved
so
large
a
collection
of
idiomatic
phrases
words
and
similes
whole
stories
in
themselves
and
pictures
of
society
at
the
time
which
grow
more
interesting
the
more
historic
they
become
the
keen
peddler
comes
sharply
forward
from
a
background
of
provincial
shiftlessness
and
dullness
and
it
is
a
mark
of
the
geniality
of
the
book
that
although
it
seems
to
have
had
its
origin
in
a
desire
on
the
part
of
its
author
to
goad
the
provinces
into
energy
and
alertness
the
local
questions
and
politics
discussed
give
a
flavour
to
the
narrative
without
limiting
the
reader
interest
one
does
not
need
to
be
deeply
concerned
in
nova
scotia
prosperity
nor
versed
in
the
turnings
of
petty
politics
to
take
a
lively
pleasure
in
the
sharp
thrusts
which
the
author
under
shield
of
the
clockmaker
wit
gives
at
stupidity
and
narrowness
the
two
sides
of
the
question
involved
are
as
little
a
matter
of
concern
to
the
general
reader
as
the
opposing
factions
of
york
and
lancaster
no
doubt
the
marked
contrast
between
the
neighbouring
people
of
nova
scotia
and
new
england
was
quickly
discerned
by
so
good
an
observer
as
the
author
proved
himself
to
be
while
his
national
and
partisan
judgments
made
his
characterization
of
the
yankee
to
be
a
sword
that
cut
with
equal
keenness
the
colonist
and
the
democrat
while
he
has
no
liking
for
the
united
states
politically
he
is
very
glad
to
make
their
enterprise
and
industry
put
to
shame
the
slow
wits
of
his
countrymen
and
the
quiet
satire
of
united
states
institutions
and
character
which
he
displays
by
letting
slick
run
to
the
end
of
his
rope
is
curiously
mingled
with
the
contempt
which
he
lets
the
same
character
express
for
nova
scotians
and
in
which
it
is
plain
he
himself
joins
thomas
chandler
haliburton
was
born
at
windsor
nova
scotia
in
was
educated
at
king
college
and
admitted
to
the
bar
in
he
entered
political
life
shortly
after
and
was
elected
member
of
the
house
of
assembly
in
he
was
appointed
chief
justice
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
and
in
was
made
judge
of
the
supreme
court
he
resigned
in
and
went
to
england
to
reside
where
in
he
was
elected
member
of
parliament
for
the
borough
of
launceston
and
at
the
dissolution
of
parliament
in
he
declined
reelection
on
the
score
of
infirm
health
he
died
at
isleworth
in
july
of
the
same
year
his
party
politics
were
of
the
old
tory
school
and
he
held
rigidly
by
them
sharing
the
common
experience
of
colonial
partisans
who
on
returning
to
the
mother
country
are
very
apt
to
set
a
higher
value
on
their
party
principles
than
those
who
have
always
remained
at
home
the
first
appearance
of
his
clockmaker
was
in
the
form
of
a
series
of
letters
to
the
nova
scotian
newspaper
in
the
contributions
were
collected
into
the
present
volume
in
and
were
eagerly
read
both
in
america
and
in
england
the
wit
of
the
book
making
it
equally
enjoyable
on
both
sides
of
the
water
while
its
pointed
reflections
raised
a
good
deal
of
angry
discussion
also
perhaps
the
most
vehement
attack
which
his
writings
received
from
the
side
of
purely
literary
criticism
was
a
review
by
felton
in
the
north
american
review
in
which
the
critic
spoke
in
tones
of
great
disgust
at
the
entire
conception
and
execution
of
the
character
of
sam
slick
quite
possibly
some
of
professor
felton
severity
drew
its
strength
from
a
personal
regard
for
everett
who
figures
rather
poorly
in
judge
haliburton
pages
there
was
so
little
however
of
discriminating
criticism
at
that
time
by
american
writers
that
it
is
not
easy
to
determine
just
how
the
book
was
measured
by
our
countrymen
probably
it
was
hardly
looked
upon
as
literature
by
the
scholar
and
the
ordinary
reader
did
not
mar
his
pleasure
in
the
fun
by
looking
at
it
too
critically
the
vein
was
worked
by
the
author
with
less
success
in
the
attache
or
sam
slick
in
england
where
the
violent
improbability
of
the
plan
involving
an
offensive
contrast
between
the
english
and
american
characters
leaves
the
really
clever
parts
of
the

we

howe
sir
i
received
your
letter
and
note
its
contents
i
ai
over
half
pleased
i
tell
you
i
think
i
have
been
used
scandalous
that
a
fact
it
war
the
part
of
a
gentleman
for
to
go
and
pump
me
arter
that
fashion
and
then
go
right
off
and
blart
it
out
in
print
it
was
a
nasty
dirty
mean
action
and
i
do
thank
you
nor
the
squire
a
bit
for
it
it
will
be
more
nor
a
thousand
dollars
out
of
my
pocket
there
an
eend
to
the
clock
trade
now
and
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
i
made
of
it
hav
i
i
shall
never
hear
the
last
on
it
and
what
am
i
to
say
when
i
go
back
to
the
states
i
take
my
oath
i
never
said
one
half
the
stuff
he
has
set
down
there
and
as
for
that
long
lochrum
about
everett
and
the
hon
alden
gobble
and
minister
there
ai
a
word
of
truth
in
it
from
beginnin
to
eend
if
ever
i
come
near
hand
to
him
agin
i
larn
him
but
never
mind
i
say
nothin
now
there
one
thing
i
do
cleverly
understand
if
this
here
book
is
my
sayin
and
doin
how
comes
it
or
the
squire
either
if
my
thoughts
and
notions
are
my
own
how
can
they
be
any
other
folks
according
to
my
idee
you
have
no
more
right
to
take
them
than
you
have
to
take
my
clocks
without
payin
for
a
man
that
would
be
guilty
of
such
an
action
is
no
gentleman
flat
and
if
you
do
like
it
you
may
lump
it
for
i
do
vally
him
nor
you
neither
nor
are
a
bluenose
that
ever
stepped
in
shoe
leather
the
matter
of
a
pin
head
i
do
know
as
ever
i
felt
so
ugly
afore
since
i
was
raised
why
did
he
put
his
name
to
it
as
well
as
mine
when
an
article
hai
the
maker
name
and
factory
on
it
it
shows
it
a
cheat
and
he
ashamed
to
own
it
if
i
to
have
the
name
i
have
the
game
or
i
know
the
cause
why
that
a
fact
now
folks
say
you
are
a
considerable
of
a
candid
man
and
right
up
and
down
in
your
dealins
and
do
things
above
board
handsum
at
least
so
i
hearn
tell
that
what
i
like
i
love
to
deal
with
such
folks
now
spose
you
make
me
an
offer
you
find
me
not
very
difficult
to
trade
with
and
i
do
know
but
i
might
put
off
more
than
half
of
the
books
myself
tu
i
tell
you
how
i
work
it
i
say
here
a
book
they
namesaked
arter
me
sam
slick
the
clockmaker
but
it
ai
mine
and
i
ca
altogether
jist
say
rightly
whose
it
is
some
say
it
the
general
and
some
say
the
bishop
and
some
say
it
howe
himself
but
i
ai
availed
who
it
is
it
a
wise
child
that
knows
its
own
father
it
wipes
up
the
bluenoses
considerable
hard
and
do
let
off
the
yankees
so
very
easy
neither
but
it
generally
allowed
to
be
about
the
prettiest
book
ever
writ
in
this
country
and
although
it
ai
altogether
jist
gospel
what
in
it
there
some
pretty
home
truths
in
it
that
a
fact
whoever
wrote
it
must
be
a
funny
feller
too
sartin
for
there
are
some
queer
stories
in
it
that
no
soul
could
help
larfin
at
that
a
fact
it
about
the
wittiest
book
i
ever
seed
it
nearly
all
sold
off
but
jist
a
few
copies
i
kept
for
my
old
customers
the
price
is
just
but
i
let
you
have
it
for
because
you
not
get
another
chance
to
have
one
always
ax
a
sixpence
more
than
the
price
and
then
bate
it
and
when
bluenose
hears
that
he
thinks
he
got
a
bargain
and
bites
directly
i
never
see
one
on
yet
that
did
fall
right
into
the
trap
yes
make
me
an
offer
and
you
and
i
will
trade
i
think
but
fair
play
a
jewel
and
i
must
say
i
feel
riled
and
kinder
sore
i
been
used
handsum
atween
you
two
and
it
do
seem
to
me
that
i
had
ought
to
be
made
a
fool
on
in
that
book
arter
that
fashion
for
folks
to
laugh
at
and
then
be
sheered
out
of
the
spec
if
i
am
somebody
had
better
look
out
for
squalls
i
tell
you
i
as
easy
as
an
old
glove
but
a
glove
ai
an
old
shoe
to
be
trod
on
and
i
think
a
certain
person
will
find
that
out
afore
he
is
six
months
older
or
else
i
mistakened
that
all
hopin
to
hear
from
you
soon
i
remain
yours
to
command
samuel
slick
pugnose
inn
river
philip
i
see
in
the
last
page
it
is
writ
that
the
squire
is
to
take
another
journey
round
the
shore
and
back
to
halifax
with
me
next
spring
well
i
did
agree
with
him
to
drive
him
round
the
coast
but
do
you
mind
we
understand
each
other
i
guess
afore
we
start
i
consait
he
rise
considerable
airly
in
the
mornin
afore
he
catches
me
asleep
agin
i
be
wide
awake
for
him
next
hitch
a
fact
i
a
gin
a
thousand
dollars
if
he
had
only
used
name
instead
of
mine
for
he
was
a
most
an
almighty
villain
and
cheated
a
proper
raft
of
folks
and
then
shipped
himself
off
to
botany
bay
for
fear
folks
would
transport
him
there
you
rub
out
slick
and
put
in
campbell
could
you
that
a
good
feller
if
you
would
i
make
it
worth
your
while
you
may
depend
the
clockmaker
no
i
the
trotting
horse
i
was
always
well
mounted
i
am
fond
of
a
horse
and
always
piqued
myself
on
having
the
fastest
trotter
in
the
province
i
have
made
no
great
progress
in
the
world
i
feel
doubly
therefore
the
pleasure
of
not
being
surpassed
on
the
road
i
never
feel
so
well
or
so
cheerful
as
on
horseback
for
there
is
something
exhilirating
in
quick
motion
and
old
as
i
am
i
feel
a
pleasure
in
making
any
person
whom
i
meet
on
the
way
put
his
horse
to
the
full
gallop
to
keep
pace
with
my
trotter
poor
ethiope
you
recollect
him
how
he
was
wont
to
lay
back
his
ears
on
his
arched
neck
and
push
away
from
all
competition
he
is
done
poor
fellow
the
spavin
spoiled
his
speed
and
he
now
roams
at
large
upon
my
farm
at
truro
mohawk
never
failed
me
till
this
summer
i
pride
myself
you
may
laugh
at
such
childish
weakness
in
a
man
of
my
age
but
still
i
pride
myself
in
taking
the
concert
out
of
coxcombs
i
meet
on
the
road
and
on
the
ease
with
which
i
can
leave
a
fool
behind
whose
nonsense
disturbs
my
solitary
musings
on
my
last
journey
to
fort
lawrence
as
the
beautiful
view
of
colchester
had
just
opened
upon
me
and
as
i
was
contemplating
its
richness
and
exquisite
scenery
a
tall
thin
man
with
hollow
cheeks
and
bright
twinkling
black
eyes
on
a
good
bay
horse
somewhat
out
of
condition
overtook
me
and
drawing
up
said
i
guess
you
started
early
this
morning
sir
i
did
sir
i
replied
you
did
not
come
from
halifax
i
presume
sir
did
you
in
a
dialect
too
rich
to
be
mistaken
as
genuine
yankee
and
which
way
may
you
be
travelling
asked
my
inquisitive
companion
to
fort
lawrence
ah
said
he
so
am
i
it
is
in
my
circuit
the
word
circuit
sounded
so
professional
i
looked
again
at
him
to
ascertain
whether
i
had
ever
seen
him
before
or
whether
i
had
met
with
one
of
those
nameless
but
innumerable
limbs
of
the
law
who
now
flourish
in
every
district
of
the
province
there
was
a
keenness
about
his
eye
and
an
acuteness
of
expression
much
in
favour
of
the
law
but
the
dress
and
general
bearing
of
the
man
made
against
the
supposition
his
was
not
the
coat
of
a
man
who
can
afford
to
wear
an
old
coat
nor
was
it
one
of
tempest
and
moore
that
distinguish
country
lawyers
from
country
boobies
his
clothes
were
well
made
and
of
good
materials
but
looked
as
if
their
owner
had
shrunk
a
little
since
they
were
made
for
him
they
hung
somewhat
loose
on
him
a
large
brooch
and
some
superfluous
seals
and
gold
keys
which
ornamented
his
outward
man
looked
new
england
like
a
visit
to
the
states
had
perhaps
i
thought
turned
this
colchester
beau
into
a
yankee
fop
of
what
consequence
was
it
to
me
who
he
was
in
either
case
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
and
i
desired
neither
his
acquaintance
nor
his
company
still
i
could
not
but
ask
myself
who
can
this
man
be
i
am
not
aware
said
i
that
there
is
a
court
sitting
at
this
time
at
cumberland
nor
am
i
said
my
friend
what
then
could
he
have
to
do
with
the
circuit
it
occurred
to
me
he
must
be
a
methodist
preacher
i
looked
again
but
his
appearance
again
puzzled
me
his
attire
might
do
the
colour
might
be
suitable
the
broad
brim
not
out
of
place
but
there
was
a
want
of
that
staidness
of
look
that
seriousness
of
countenance
that
expression
in
short
so
characteristic
of
the
clergy
i
could
not
account
for
my
idle
curiosity
a
curiosity
which
in
him
i
had
the
moment
before
viewed
both
with
suspicion
and
disgust
but
so
it
was
i
felt
a
desire
to
know
who
he
could
be
who
was
neither
lawyer
nor
preacher
and
yet
talked
of
his
circuit
with
the
gravity
of
both
how
ridiculous
i
thought
to
myself
is
this
i
will
leave
him
turning
towards
him
i
said
i
feared
i
should
be
late
for
breakfast
and
must
therefore
bid
him
good
morning
mohawk
felt
the
pressure
of
my
knees
and
away
we
went
at
a
slapping
pace
i
congratulated
myself
on
conquering
my
own
curiosity
and
on
avoiding
that
of
my
travelling
companion
this
i
said
to
myself
this
is
the
value
of
a
good
horse
i
patted
his
neck
i
felt
proud
of
him
presently
i
heard
the
steps
of
the
unknown
horse
the
clatter
increased
ah
my
friend
thought
i
it
wo
do
you
should
be
well
mounted
if
you
desire
my
company
i
pushed
mohawk
faster
faster
faster
to
his
best
he
outdid
himself
he
had
never
trotted
so
handsomely
so
easily
so
well
i
guess
that
is
a
pretty
considerable
smart
horse
said
the
stranger
as
he
came
beside
me
and
apparently
reined
in
to
prevent
his
horse
passing
me
there
is
not
i
reckon
so
spry
a
one
on
my
circuit
circuit
or
no
circuit
one
thing
was
settled
in
my
mind
he
was
a
yankee
and
a
very
impertinent
yankee
too
i
felt
humbled
my
pride
was
hurt
and
mohawk
was
beaten
to
continue
this
trotting
contest
was
humiliating
i
yielded
therefore
before
the
victory
was
palpable
and
pulled
up
yes
continued
he
a
horse
of
pretty
considerable
good
action
and
a
pretty
fair
trotter
too
i
guess
pride
must
have
a
fall
i
confess
mine
was
prostrate
in
the
dust
these
words
cut
me
to
the
heart
what
is
it
come
to
this
poor
mohawk
that
you
the
admiration
of
all
but
the
envious
the
great
mohawk
the
oracle
horse
the
standard
by
which
all
other
horses
are
measured
trots
next
to
mohawk
only
yields
to
mohawk
looks
like
mohawk
that
you
are
after
all
only
a
counterfeit
and
pronounced
by
a
straggling
yankee
to
be
merely
a
pretty
fair
trotter
if
he
was
trained
i
guess
he
might
be
made
to
do
a
little
more
excuse
me
but
if
you
divide
your
weight
between
the
knee
and
the
stirrup
rather
most
on
the
knee
and
rise
forward
on
the
saddle
so
as
to
leave
a
little
daylight
between
you
and
it
i
hope
i
may
never
ride
this
circuit
again
if
you
do
get
a
mile
more
an
hour
out
of
him
what
not
enough
i
mentally
groaned
to
have
my
horse
beaten
but
i
must
be
told
that
i
do
know
how
to
ride
him
and
that
too
by
a
yankee
aye
there
the
rub
a
yankee
what
perhaps
a
puppy
half
yankee
half
bluenose
as
there
is
no
escape
i
try
to
make
out
my
riding
master
your
circuit
said
i
my
looks
expressing
all
the
surprise
they
were
capable
of
your
circuit
pray
what
may
that
be
oh
said
he
the
eastern
circuit
i
am
on
the
eastern
circuit
sir
i
have
heard
said
i
feeling
that
i
now
had
a
lawyer
to
deal
with
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
business
on
this
circuit
pray
are
there
many
cases
of
importance
there
is
a
pretty
fair
business
to
be
done
at
least
there
has
been
but
the
cases
are
of
no
great
value
we
do
not
make
much
out
of
them
we
get
them
up
very
easy
but
they
do
bring
much
profit
what
a
beast
thought
i
is
this
and
what
a
curse
to
a
country
to
have
such
an
unfeeling
pettifogging
rascal
practising
in
it
a
horse
jockey
too
what
a
finished
character
i
try
him
on
that
branch
of
his
business
that
is
a
superior
animal
you
are
mounted
on
said
i
i
seldom
meet
one
that
can
travel
with
mine
yes
said
he
coolly
a
considerable
fair
traveller
and
most
particular
good
bottom
i
hesitated
this
man
who
talks
with
such
unblushing
effrontery
of
getting
up
cases
and
making
profit
out
of
them
can
not
be
offended
at
the
question
yes
i
will
put
it
to
him
do
you
feel
an
inclination
to
part
with
him
i
never
part
with
a
horse
sir
that
suits
me
said
he
i
am
fond
of
a
horse
i
do
like
to
ride
in
the
dust
after
every
one
i
meet
and
i
allow
no
man
to
pass
me
but
when
i
choose
is
it
possible
i
thought
that
he
can
know
me
that
he
has
heard
of
my
foible
and
is
quizzing
me
or
have
i
this
feeling
in
common
with
him
but
continued
i
you
might
supply
yourself
again
not
on
this
circuit
i
guess
said
he
nor
yet
in
circuit
campbell
circuit
pray
sir
what
is
that
that
said
he
is
the
western
and
lampton
rides
the
shore
circuit
and
as
for
the
people
on
the
shore
they
know
so
little
of
horses
that
lampton
tells
me
a
man
from
aylesford
once
sold
a
hornless
ox
there
whose
tail
he
had
cut
and
nicked
for
a
horse
of
the
goliah
breed
i
should
think
said
i
that
lampton
must
have
no
lack
of
cases
among
such
enlightened
clients
clients
sir
said
my
friend
lampton
is
not
a
lawyer
i
beg
pardon
i
thought
you
said
he
rode
the
circuit
we
call
it
a
circuit
said
the
stranger
who
seemed
by
no
means
flattered
by
the
mistake
we
divide
the
province
as
in
the
almanac
into
circuits
in
each
of
which
we
separately
carry
on
our
business
of
manufacturing
and
selling
clocks
there
are
few
i
guess
said
the
clockmaker
who
go
upon
tick
as
much
as
we
do
who
have
so
little
use
for
lawyers
if
attornies
could
wind
a
man
up
again
after
he
has
been
fairly
run
down
i
guess
they
be
a
pretty
harmless
sort
of
folks
this
explanation
restored
my
good
humour
and
as
i
could
not
quit
my
companion
and
he
did
not
feel
disposed
to
leave
me
i
made
up
my
mind
to
travel
with
him
to
fort
lawrence
the
limit
of
his
circuit
no
ii
the
clockmaker
i
had
heard
of
yankee
clock
peddlers
tin
peddlers
and
bible
peddlers
especially
of
him
who
sold
polyglot
bibles
all
in
english
to
the
amount
of
sixteen
thousand
pounds
the
house
of
every
substantial
farmer
had
three
substantial
ornaments
a
wooden
clock
a
tin
reflector
and
a
polyglot
bible
how
is
it
that
an
american
can
sell
his
wares
at
whatever
price
he
pleases
where
a
bluenose
would
fail
to
make
a
sale
at
all
i
will
enquire
of
the
clockmaker
the
secret
of
his
success
what
a
pity
it
is
slick
for
such
was
his
name
what
a
pity
it
is
said
i
that
you
who
are
so
successful
in
teaching
these
people
the
value
of
clocks
could
not
also
teach
them
the
value
of
time
i
guess
said
he
they
have
got
that
ring
to
grow
on
their
horns
yet
which
every
has
in
our
country
we
reckon
hours
and
minutes
to
be
dollars
and
cents
they
do
nothing
in
these
parts
but
eat
drink
smoke
sleep
ride
about
lounge
at
taverns
make
speeches
at
temperance
meetings
and
talk
about
of
assembly
if
a
man
do
hoe
his
corn
and
he
do
get
a
crop
he
says
it
is
all
owing
to
the
bank
and
if
he
runs
into
debt
and
is
sued
why
he
says
the
lawyers
are
a
curse
to
the
country
they
are
a
most
idle
set
of
folks
i
tell
you
but
how
is
it
said
i
that
you
manage
to
sell
such
an
immense
number
of
clocks
which
certainly
can
not
be
called
necessary
articles
among
a
people
with
whom
there
seems
to
be
so
great
a
scarcity
of
money
slick
paused
as
if
considering
the
propriety
of
answering
the
question
and
looking
me
in
the
face
said
in
a
confidential
tone
why
i
do
care
if
i
do
tell
you
for
the
market
is
glutted
and
i
shall
quit
this
circuit
it
is
done
by
a
knowledge
of
soft
sawder
and
human
natur
but
here
is
deacon
flint
said
he
i
have
but
one
clock
left
and
i
guess
i
will
sell
it
to
him
at
the
gate
of
a
most
comfortable
looking
farm
house
stood
deacon
flint
a
respectable
old
man
who
had
understood
the
value
of
time
better
than
most
of
his
neighbours
if
one
might
judge
from
the
appearance
of
everything
about
him
after
the
usual
salutation
an
invitation
to
alight
was
accepted
by
slick
who
said
he
wished
to
take
leave
of
flint
before
he
left
colchester
we
had
hardly
entered
the
house
before
the
clockmaker
pointed
to
the
view
from
the
window
and
addressing
himself
to
me
said
if
i
was
to
tell
them
in
connecticut
there
was
such
a
farm
as
this
away
down
east
here
in
nova
scotia
they
would
believe
me
why
there
such
a
location
in
all
new
england
the
deacon
has
a
hundred
acres
of
dyke
seventy
said
the
deacon
only
seventy
well
seventy
but
then
there
is
your
fine
deep
bottom
why
i
could
run
a
ramrod
into
it
interval
we
call
it
said
the
deacon
who
though
evidently
pleased
at
this
eulogium
seemed
to
wish
the
experiment
of
the
ramrod
to
be
tried
in
the
right
place
well
interval
if
you
please
though
professor
eleazer
cumstick
in
his
work
on
ohio
calls
them
bottoms
is
just
as
good
as
dyke
then
there
is
that
water
privilege
worth
three
or
four
thousand
dollars
twice
as
good
as
what
governor
cass
paid
fifteen
thousand
dollars
for
i
wonder
deacon
you
do
put
up
a
carding
mill
on
it
the
same
works
would
carry
a
turning
lathe
a
shingle
machine
a
circular
saw
grind
bark
and
too
old
said
the
deacon
too
old
for
all
those
speculations
old
repeated
the
clockmaker
not
you
why
you
are
worth
half
a
dozen
of
the
young
men
we
see
nowadays
you
are
young
enough
to
have
here
he
said
something
in
a
lower
tone
of
voice
which
i
did
not
distinctly
hear
but
whatever
it
was
the
deacon
was
pleased
he
smiled
and
said
he
did
not
think
of
such
things
now
but
your
beasts
dear
me
your
beasts
must
be
put
in
and
have
a
feed
saying
which
he
went
out
to
order
them
to
be
taken
to
the
stable
as
the
old
gentleman
closed
the
door
after
him
slick
drew
near
to
me
and
said
in
an
undertone
that
is
what
i
call
sawder
an
englishman
would
pass
that
man
as
a
sheep
passes
a
hog
in
a
pasture
without
looking
at
him
or
said
he
looking
rather
archly
if
he
was
mounted
on
a
pretty
smart
horse
i
guess
he
trot
away
if
he
could
now
i
find
here
his
lecture
on
soft
sawder
was
cut
short
by
the
entrance
of
flint
jist
come
to
say
mrs
flint
what
have
you
sold
all
your
clocks
yes
and
very
low
too
for
money
is
scarce
and
i
wished
to
close
the
consarn
no
i
am
wrong
in
saying
all
for
i
have
just
one
left
neighbour
steel
wife
asked
to
have
the
refusal
of
it
but
i
guess
i
wo
sell
it
i
had
but
two
of
them
this
one
and
the
feller
of
it
that
i
sold
governor
lincoln
general
green
the
secretary
of
state
for
maine
said
he
give
me
forty
dollars
for
this
here
one
it
has
composition
wheels
and
patent
axles
it
is
a
beautiful
article
a
real
first
chop
no
mistake
genuine
superfine
but
i
guess
i
take
it
back
and
beside
squire
hawk
might
think
kinder
hard
that
i
did
not
give
him
the
offer
dear
me
said
flint
i
should
like
to
see
it
where
is
it
it
is
in
a
chest
of
mine
over
the
way
at
tom
tape
store
i
guess
he
can
ship
it
on
to
eastport
that
a
good
man
said
flint
jist
let
look
at
it
slick
willing
to
oblige
yielded
to
these
entreaties
and
soon
produced
the
clock
a
gawdy
highly
varnished
trumpery
looking
affair
he
placed
it
on
the
where
its
beauties
were
pointed
out
and
duly
appreciated
by
flint
whose
admiration
was
about
ending
in
a
proposal
when
flint
returned
from
giving
his
directions
about
the
care
of
the
horses
the
deacon
praised
the
clock
he
too
thought
it
a
handsome
one
but
the
deacon
was
a
prudent
man
he
had
a
watch
he
was
sorry
but
he
had
no
occasion
for
a
clock
i
guess
you
in
the
wrong
furrow
this
time
deacon
it
ai
for
sale
said
slick
and
if
it
was
i
reckon
neighbour
wife
would
have
it
for
she
gives
me
no
peace
about
it
flint
said
that
steel
had
enough
to
do
poor
man
to
pay
his
interest
without
buying
clocks
for
his
wife
it
no
consarn
of
mine
said
slick
as
long
as
he
pays
me
what
he
has
to
do
but
i
guess
i
do
want
to
sell
it
and
beside
it
comes
too
high
that
clock
ca
be
made
at
rhode
island
under
forty
dollars
why
it
ai
possible
said
the
clockmaker
in
apparent
surprise
looking
at
his
watch
why
as
i
alive
it
is
four
and
if
i
hav
been
two
hours
here
how
on
airth
shall
i
reach
river
philip
tonight
i
tell
you
what
flint
i
leave
the
clock
in
your
care
till
i
return
on
my
way
to
the
states
i
set
it
and
put
it
to
the
right
time
as
soon
as
this
operation
was
performed
he
delivered
the
key
to
the
deacon
with
a
sort
of
injunction
to
wind
up
the
clock
every
saturday
night
which
flint
said
she
would
take
care
should
be
done
and
promised
to
remind
her
husband
of
it
in
case
he
should
chance
to
forget
it
that
said
the
clockmaker
as
soon
as
we
were
mounted
that
i
call
natur
now
that
clock
is
sold
for
forty
dollars
it
cost
me
just
six
dollars
and
fifty
cents
flint
will
never
let
steel
have
the
refusal
nor
will
the
deacon
learn
until
i
call
for
the
clock
that
having
once
indulged
in
the
use
of
a
superfluity
how
difficult
it
is
to
give
it
up
we
can
do
without
any
article
of
luxury
we
have
never
had
but
when
once
obtained
it
is
not
in
natur
to
surrender
it
voluntarily
of
fifteen
thousand
sold
by
myself
and
partners
in
this
province
twelve
thousand
were
left
in
this
manner
and
only
ten
clocks
were
ever
returned
when
we
called
for
them
they
invariably
bought
them
we
trust
to
sawder
to
get
them
into
the
house
and
to
natur
that
they
never
come
out
of
it
no
iii
the
silent
girls
do
you
see
them
swallows
said
the
clockmaker
how
low
they
fly
well
i
presume
we
shall
have
rain
right
away
and
them
noisy
critters
them
gulls
how
close
they
keep
to
the
water
down
there
in
the
shubenacadie
well
that
a
sure
sign
if
we
study
natur
we
do
want
no
thermometer
but
i
guess
we
shall
be
in
time
to
get
under
cover
in
a
shed
about
three
miles
ahead
on
us
we
had
just
reached
the
deserted
hovel
when
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
i
reckon
said
the
clockmaker
as
he
sat
himself
down
on
a
bundle
of
shingles
i
reckon
they
are
bad
off
for
inns
in
this
country
when
a
feller
is
too
lazy
to
work
here
he
paints
his
name
over
his
door
and
calls
it
a
tavern
and
as
like
as
not
he
makes
the
whole
neighbourhood
as
lazy
as
himself
it
is
about
as
easy
to
find
a
good
inn
in
halifax
as
it
is
to
find
wool
on
a
goat
back
an
inn
to
be
a
good
consarn
must
be
built
a
purpose
you
can
no
more
make
a
good
tavern
out
of
a
common
dwelling
house
i
expect
than
a
good
coat
out
of
an
old
pair
of
trousers
they
are
etarnal
lazy
you
may
depend
now
there
might
be
a
grand
spec
made
there
in
building
a
good
inn
and
a
good
church
what
a
sacrilegious
and
unnatural
union
said
i
with
most
unaffected
surprise
not
at
all
said
slick
we
build
both
on
speculation
in
the
states
and
make
a
good
deal
of
profit
out
of
too
i
tell
you
we
look
out
a
good
sightly
place
in
a
town
like
halifax
that
is
pretty
considerably
well
peopled
with
folks
that
are
good
marks
and
if
there
is
no
real
right
down
good
preacher
among
them
we
build
a
handsome
church
touched
off
like
a
new
york
liner
a
real
taking
looking
thing
and
then
we
look
out
for
a
preacher
a
crack
man
a
regular
ten
horse
power
chap
well
we
hire
him
and
we
have
to
give
pretty
high
wages
too
say
twelve
hundred
or
sixteen
hundred
dollars
a
year
we
take
him
at
first
on
trial
for
a
sabbath
or
two
to
try
his
paces
and
if
he
takes
with
the
folks
if
he
goes
down
well
we
clinch
the
bargain
and
let
and
sell
the
pews
and
i
tell
you
it
pays
well
and
makes
a
real
good
investment
there
were
few
better
specs
among
us
than
inns
and
churches
until
the
railroads
came
on
the
carpet
as
soon
as
the
novelty
of
the
new
preacher
wears
off
we
hire
another
and
that
keeps
up
the
steam
i
trust
it
will
be
long
very
long
my
friend
said
i
ere
the
rage
for
speculation
introduces
into
the
temple
with
us
slick
looked
at
me
with
a
most
ineffable
expression
of
pity
and
surprise
depend
on
it
sir
said
he
with
a
most
philosophical
air
this
province
is
much
behind
the
intelligence
of
the
age
but
if
it
is
behind
us
in
that
respect
it
is
a
long
chalk
ahead
on
us
in
others
i
never
seed
or
heerd
tell
of
a
country
that
had
so
many
natural
privileges
as
this
why
there
are
twice
as
many
harbours
and
here
as
we
have
all
the
way
from
eastport
to
new
orleens
they
have
all
they
can
ax
and
more
than
they
desarve
they
have
iron
coal
slate
grindstone
lime
firestone
gypsum
and
a
list
as
long
as
an
auctioneer
catalogue
but
they
are
either
asleep
or
stone
blind
to
them
their
shores
are
crowded
with
fish
and
their
lands
covered
with
wood
a
government
that
lays
as
light
on
as
a
down
and
no
taxes
then
look
at
their
dykes
the
lord
seems
to
have
made
on
purpose
for
such
lazy
folks
if
you
were
to
tell
the
citizens
of
our
country
that
these
dykes
had
been
cropped
for
a
hundred
years
without
manure
say
they
guessed
you
had
seen
crockett
the
greatest
hand
at
a
flam
in
our
nation
you
have
heerd
tell
of
a
man
who
could
see
london
for
the
houses
i
tell
you
if
we
had
this
country
you
could
see
the
harbours
for
the
shipping
there
be
a
rush
of
folks
to
it
as
there
is
in
one
of
our
inns
to
the
dinner
table
when
they
sometimes
get
jammed
together
in
the
and
a
man
has
to
take
a
running
leap
over
their
heads
afore
he
can
get
in
a
little
nigger
boy
in
new
york
found
a
diamond
worth
two
thousand
dollars
well
he
sold
it
to
a
watchmaker
for
fifty
cents
the
little
critter
did
know
no
better
your
people
are
just
like
the
nigger
boy
they
do
know
the
value
of
their
diamond
do
you
know
the
reason
monkeys
are
no
good
because
they
chatter
all
day
long
so
do
the
niggers
and
so
do
the
bluenoses
of
nova
scotia
it
all
talk
and
no
work
now
with
us
it
all
work
and
no
talk
in
our
ship
yards
our
factories
our
mills
and
even
in
our
vessels
there
no
talk
a
man
ca
work
and
talk
too
i
guess
if
you
were
at
the
factories
at
lowell
we
show
you
a
wonder
five
hundred
gals
at
work
together
all
in
silence
i
do
think
our
great
country
has
such
a
real
natural
curiosity
as
that
i
expect
the
world
contain
the
beat
of
that
for
a
woman
tongue
goes
so
slick
of
itself
without
water
power
or
steam
and
moves
so
easy
on
its
hinges
that
it
no
easy
matter
to
put
a
spring
stop
on
it
i
tell
you
it
comes
as
natural
as
drinkin
mint
julip
i
do
pretend
to
say
the
gals
do
nullify
the
rule
sometimes
at
intermission
and
arter
hours
but
when
they
do
if
they
do
let
go
then
it
a
pity
you
have
heerd
a
school
come
out
of
little
boys
lord
it
no
touch
to
it
or
a
flock
of
geese
at
it
they
are
no
more
a
match
for
than
a
pony
is
for
a
but
when
they
are
at
work
all
as
still
as
sleep
and
no
snoring
i
guess
we
have
a
right
to
brag
o
that
invention
we
trained
the
dear
critters
so
they
do
think
of
striking
the
minutes
and
seconds
no
longer
now
the
folks
of
halifax
take
it
all
out
in
talking
they
talk
of
steamboats
whalers
and
railroads
but
they
all
end
where
they
begin
in
talk
i
do
think
i
be
out
in
my
latitude
if
i
was
to
say
they
beat
the
womenkind
at
that
one
feller
says
talk
of
going
to
england
another
says
talk
of
going
to
the
country
while
a
third
says
talk
of
going
to
sleep
if
we
happen
to
speak
of
such
things
we
say
right
off
down
east
or
away
off
south
and
away
we
go
jist
like
a
streak
of
lightning
when
we
want
folks
to
talk
we
pay
for
it
such
as
ministers
lawyers
and
members
of
congress
but
then
we
expect
the
use
of
their
tongues
and
not
their
hands
and
when
we
pay
folks
to
work
we
expect
the
use
of
their
hands
and
not
their
tongues
i
guess
work
do
come
kind
o
natural
to
the
people
of
this
province
no
more
than
it
does
to
a
horse
i
expect
they
think
they
have
a
little
too
much
blood
in
for
work
for
they
are
near
about
as
proud
as
they
are
lazy
now
the
bees
know
how
to
sarve
out
such
chaps
for
they
have
their
drones
too
well
they
reckon
it
no
fun
honey
all
summer
for
these
idle
critters
to
eat
all
winter
so
they
give
lynch
law
they
have
a
regular
built
mob
of
citizens
and
string
up
the
drones
like
the
vicksburg
gamblers
their
maxim
is
and
not
a
bad
one
neither
i
guess
work
no
honey
no
iv
conversations
at
the
river
philip
it
was
late
before
we
arrived
at
pugnose
inn
the
evening
was
cool
and
a
fire
was
cheering
and
comfortable
slick
declined
any
share
in
the
bottle
of
wine
he
said
he
was
dyspeptic
and
a
glass
or
two
soon
convinced
me
that
it
was
likely
to
produce
in
me
something
worse
than
dyspepsy
it
was
speedily
removed
and
we
drew
up
to
the
fire
taking
a
small
penknife
from
his
pocket
he
began
to
whittle
a
thin
piece
of
dry
wood
which
lay
on
the
hearth
and
after
musing
some
time
said
i
guess
you
never
been
in
the
states
i
replied
that
i
had
not
but
that
before
i
returned
to
england
i
proposed
visiting
that
country
there
said
he
you
see
the
great
daniel
webster
he
a
great
man
i
tell
you
king
william
number
four
i
guess
would
be
no
match
for
him
as
an
orator
he
talk
him
out
of
sight
in
half
an
hour
if
he
was
in
your
house
of
commons
i
reckon
he
make
some
of
your
great
folks
look
pretty
streaked
he
a
true
patriot
and
statesman
the
first
in
our
country
and
a
most
particular
cute
lawyer
there
was
a
quaker
chap
too
cute
for
him
once
though
this
quaker
a
pretty
knowin
old
shaver
had
a
cause
down
to
rhode
island
so
he
went
to
daniel
to
hire
him
to
go
down
and
plead
his
case
for
him
so
says
he
webster
what
your
fee
says
daniel
me
see
i
have
to
go
down
south
to
washington
to
plead
the
great
insurance
case
of
the
hartford
company
and
i
got
to
be
at
cincinnati
to
attend
the
convention
and
i
do
see
how
i
can
go
to
rhode
island
without
great
loss
and
great
fatigue
it
would
cost
you
maybe
more
than
you
be
willing
to
give
well
the
quaker
looked
pretty
white
about
the
gills
i
tell
you
when
he
heard
this
for
he
could
do
without
him
no
how
and
he
did
like
this
preliminary
talk
of
his
at
all
at
last
he
made
bold
to
ask
him
the
worst
of
it
what
he
would
take
says
daniel
always
liked
the
quakers
they
are
a
quiet
peaceable
people
who
never
go
to
law
if
they
can
help
it
and
it
would
be
better
for
our
great
country
if
there
were
more
such
people
in
it
i
never
seed
or
heerd
tell
of
any
harm
in
except
going
the
whole
figure
for
gineral
jackson
and
that
everlasting
almighty
villain
van
buren
yes
i
love
the
quakers
i
hope
they
go
the
webster
ticket
yet
and
i
go
for
you
as
low
as
i
can
any
way
afford
say
one
thousand
dollars
the
quaker
well
nigh
fainted
when
he
heerd
this
but
he
was
pretty
deep
too
so
says
he
that
a
great
deal
of
money
but
i
have
more
cases
there
if
i
give
you
the
one
thousand
dollars
will
you
plead
the
other
cases
i
shall
have
to
give
you
says
daniel
will
to
the
best
of
my
humble
abilities
so
down
they
went
to
rhode
island
and
daniel
tried
the
case
and
carried
it
for
the
quaker
well
the
quaker
he
goes
round
to
all
the
folks
that
had
suits
in
court
and
says
he
will
you
give
me
if
i
get
the
great
daniel
to
plead
for
you
it
cost
me
one
thousand
dollars
for
a
fee
but
now
he
and
i
are
pretty
thick
and
as
he
is
on
the
spot
i
get
him
to
plead
cheap
for
you
so
he
got
three
hundred
dollars
from
one
and
two
from
another
and
so
on
until
he
got
eleven
hundred
dollars
jist
one
hundred
dollars
more
than
he
gave
daniel
was
in
a
great
rage
when
he
heerd
this
says
he
you
think
i
would
agree
to
your
letting
me
out
like
a
horse
to
hire
daniel
said
the
quaker
thou
not
undertake
to
plead
all
such
cases
as
i
should
have
to
give
thee
if
thou
wilt
not
stand
to
thy
agreement
neither
will
i
stand
to
mine
daniel
laughed
out
ready
to
split
his
sides
at
this
says
he
guess
i
might
as
well
stand
still
for
you
to
put
the
bridle
on
this
time
for
you
have
fairly
pinned
me
up
in
a
corner
of
the
fence
anyhow
so
he
went
good
humouredly
to
work
and
pleaded
them
all
this
lazy
fellow
pugnose
continued
the
clockmaker
that
keeps
this
inn
is
going
to
sell
off
and
go
to
the
states
he
says
he
has
to
work
too
hard
here
that
the
markets
are
dull
and
the
winter
too
long
and
he
guesses
he
can
live
easier
there
i
guess
he
find
his
mistake
afore
he
has
been
there
long
why
our
country
ai
to
be
compared
to
this
on
no
account
whatever
our
country
never
made
us
to
be
the
great
nation
we
are
but
we
made
the
country
how
on
airth
could
we
if
we
were
all
like
old
pugnose
as
lazy
as
ugly
make
that
cold
thin
soil
of
new
england
produce
what
it
does
why
sir
the
land
between
boston
and
salem
would
starve
a
flock
of
geese
and
yet
look
at
salem
it
has
more
cash
than
would
buy
nova
scotia
from
the
king
we
rise
early
live
frugally
and
work
late
what
we
get
we
take
care
of
to
all
this
we
add
enterprise
and
intelligence
a
feller
who
finds
work
too
hard
here
had
better
not
go
to
the
states
i
met
an
irishman
one
pat
lannigan
last
week
who
had
just
returned
from
the
states
says
i
what
on
airth
brought
you
back
luck
to
them
says
pat
i
war
properly
bit
what
do
you
get
a
day
in
nova
scotia
says
judge
beler
to
me
four
shillings
your
lordship
says
i
there
are
no
lords
here
says
he
we
are
all
free
well
says
he
i
give
you
as
much
in
one
day
as
you
can
earn
there
in
two
i
give
you
eight
shillings
long
life
to
your
lordship
says
i
so
next
day
to
it
i
went
with
a
party
of
men
a
piece
of
canal
and
if
it
was
a
hot
day
my
name
is
not
pat
lannigan
presently
i
looked
up
and
straightened
my
back
says
i
to
a
comrade
of
mine
mick
says
i
i
very
dry
with
that
says
the
overseer
we
do
allow
gentlemen
to
talk
at
their
work
in
this
country
faith
i
soon
found
out
for
my
two
pay
in
one
i
had
to
do
two
days
work
in
one
and
pay
two
board
in
one
and
at
the
end
of
a
month
i
found
myself
no
better
off
in
pocket
than
in
nova
scotia
while
the
devil
a
bone
in
my
body
that
did
ache
with
pain
and
as
for
my
nose
it
took
to
bleeding
and
bled
day
and
night
entirely
upon
my
soul
slick
said
he
poor
labourer
does
not
last
long
in
your
country
what
with
new
rum
hard
labour
and
hot
weather
you
see
the
graves
of
the
irish
each
side
of
the
canal
for
all
the
world
like
two
rows
of
potatoes
in
a
field
that
have
forgot
to
come
up
it
is
a
land
sir
continued
the
clockmaker
of
hard
work
we
have
two
kind
of
slaves
the
niggers
and
the
white
slaves
all
european
labourers
and
blacks
who
come
out
to
us
do
our
hard
bodily
work
while
we
direct
it
to
a
profitable
end
neither
rich
nor
poor
high
nor
low
with
us
eat
the
bread
of
idleness
our
whole
capital
is
in
active
operation
and
our
whole
population
is
in
active
employment
an
idle
fellow
like
pugnose
who
runs
away
to
us
is
clapped
into
harness
afore
he
knows
where
he
is
and
is
made
to
work
like
a
horse
that
refuses
to
draw
he
is
put
into
the
teamboat
he
finds
some
before
him
and
others
behind
him
he
must
either
draw
or
be
dragged
to
death
no
v
justice
pettifog
in
the
morning
the
clockmaker
informed
me
that
a
justice
court
was
to
be
held
that
day
at
pugnose
inn
and
he
guessed
he
could
do
a
little
business
among
the
country
folks
that
would
be
assembled
there
some
of
them
he
said
owed
him
for
clocks
and
it
would
save
him
a
world
of
travelling
to
have
the
justice
and
constable
to
drive
them
up
together
if
you
want
a
fat
wether
there
nothing
like
penning
up
the
whole
flock
in
a
corner
i
guess
said
he
if
general
campbell
knew
what
sort
of
a
man
that
magistrate
was
he
disband
him
pretty
quick
he
a
regular
suck
egg
a
disgrace
to
the
country
i
guess
if
he
acted
that
way
in
kentucky
he
get
a
breakfast
of
cold
lead
some
morning
out
of
the
small
eend
of
a
rifle
he
find
pretty
difficult
to
digest
they
tell
me
he
issues
three
hundred
writs
a
year
the
cost
of
which
including
that
tarnation
constable
fees
ca
amount
to
nothing
less
than
three
thousand
dollars
per
annum
if
the
daniel
webster
had
him
afore
a
jury
i
reckon
he
turn
him
inside
out
and
slip
him
back
again
as
quick
as
an
old
stocking
he
paint
him
to
the
life
as
plain
to
be
known
as
the
head
of
gineral
jackson
he
jist
a
fit
feller
for
lynch
law
to
be
tried
hanged
and
damned
all
at
once
there
more
nor
him
in
the
country
there
some
of
the
breed
in
every
county
in
the
province
jist
one
or
two
to
do
the
dirty
work
as
we
keep
niggers
for
jobs
that
would
give
a
white
man
the
cholera
they
ought
to
pay
his
passage
as
we
do
with
such
critters
tell
him
his
place
is
taken
in
the
mail
coach
and
if
he
is
found
here
after
hours
they
make
a
carpenter
of
him
and
hang
him
outside
the
church
steeple
to
try
if
it
was
perpendicular
he
almost
always
gives
judgment
for
plaintiff
and
if
the
poor
defendant
has
an
offset
he
makes
him
sue
it
so
that
it
grinds
a
grist
both
ways
for
him
like
the
upper
and
lower
millstone
people
soon
began
to
assemble
some
on
foot
and
others
on
horseback
and
in
wagons
pugnose
tavern
was
all
bustle
and
confusion
plaintiffs
defendants
and
witnesses
all
talking
quarrelling
explaining
and
drinking
here
comes
the
squire
said
one
i
thinking
his
horse
carries
more
roguery
than
law
said
another
they
must
have
been
in
proper
want
of
timber
to
make
a
justice
of
said
a
third
when
they
took
such
a
crooked
stick
as
that
enough
too
for
refuse
said
a
farmer
may
be
so
said
another
but
as
hard
at
the
heart
as
a
log
of
elm
howsomever
said
a
third
i
hope
it
wo
be
long
afore
he
has
the
wainy
edge
scored
off
of
him
anyhow
many
more
such
remarks
were
made
all
drawn
from
familiar
objects
but
all
expressive
of
bitterness
and
contempt
he
carried
one
or
two
large
books
with
him
in
his
gig
and
a
considerable
roll
of
papers
as
soon
as
the
obsequious
pugnose
saw
him
at
the
door
he
assisted
him
to
alight
ushered
him
into
the
best
room
and
desired
the
constable
to
attend
the
squire
the
crowd
immediately
entered
and
the
constable
opened
the
court
in
due
form
and
commanded
silence
taking
out
a
long
list
of
causes
pettifog
commenced
reading
the
names
james
sharp
versus
john
slug
call
john
slug
john
slug
being
duly
called
and
not
answering
was
defaulted
in
this
manner
he
proceeded
to
default
some
twenty
or
thirty
persons
at
last
he
came
to
a
cause
william
hare
versus
dennis
call
dennis
here
i
am
said
a
voice
from
the
other
room
here
i
am
who
has
anything
to
say
to
dennis
make
less
noise
sir
said
the
justice
or
i
commit
you
commit
me
is
it
said
dennis
take
care
then
squire
you
commit
yourself
you
are
sued
by
william
hare
for
three
pounds
for
a
month
board
and
lodging
what
have
you
to
say
to
it
say
to
it
said
dennis
did
you
ever
hear
what
tim
doyle
said
when
he
was
going
to
be
hanged
for
stealing
a
pig
says
he
the
pig
had
squeeled
in
the
bag
i
never
have
been
found
out
so
i
would
so
i
take
warning
by
tim
doyle
fate
i
say
nothing
let
him
prove
it
here
hare
was
called
on
for
his
proof
but
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
board
would
be
admitted
and
the
defence
opened
he
was
not
prepared
with
proof
i
demand
said
dennis
i
demand
an
unsuit
here
there
was
a
consultation
between
the
justice
and
the
plaintiff
when
the
justice
said
i
shall
not
nonsuit
him
i
shall
continue
the
cause
what
hang
it
up
till
next
court
you
had
better
hang
me
up
then
at
once
how
can
a
poor
man
come
here
so
often
this
may
be
the
entertainment
pugnose
advertises
for
horses
but
by
jacquers
it
is
no
entertainment
for
me
i
admit
then
sooner
than
come
again
i
admit
it
you
admit
you
owe
him
three
pounds
then
for
a
month
board
i
admit
no
such
thing
i
say
i
boarded
with
him
a
month
and
was
like
pat
moran
cow
at
the
end
of
it
at
the
lifting
bad
luck
to
him
a
neighbour
was
here
called
who
proved
that
the
three
pounds
might
be
the
usual
price
and
do
you
know
i
taught
his
children
to
write
at
the
school
said
dennis
you
might
answered
the
witness
and
what
is
that
worth
i
do
know
you
do
know
faith
i
believe
you
right
said
dennis
for
if
the
children
are
half
as
big
rogues
as
the
faither
they
might
leave
writing
alone
or
be
like
to
be
hanged
for
forgery
here
dennis
produced
his
account
for
teaching
five
children
two
quarters
at
nine
shillings
a
quarter
each
four
pounds
ten
shillings
i
am
sorry
said
the
justice
very
sorry
but
your
defence
will
not
avail
you
your
account
is
too
large
for
one
justice
any
sum
over
three
pounds
must
be
sued
before
two
magistrates
but
i
only
want
to
offset
as
much
as
will
pay
the
board
it
ca
be
done
in
this
shape
said
the
magistrate
i
will
consult
justice
dolittle
my
neighbour
and
if
hare
wo
settle
with
you
i
will
sue
it
for
you
well
said
dennis
all
i
have
to
say
is
that
there
is
not
so
big
a
rogue
as
hare
on
the
whole
river
save
and
except
one
scoundrel
who
shall
be
nameless
making
a
significant
and
humble
bow
to
the
justice
here
there
was
a
general
laugh
throughout
the
court
dennis
retired
to
the
next
room
to
indemnify
himself
by
another
glass
of
grog
and
venting
his
abuse
against
hare
and
the
magistrate
disgusted
at
the
gross
partiality
of
the
justice
i
also
quitted
the
court
fully
concurring
in
the
opinion
though
not
in
the
language
that
dennis
was
giving
utterance
to
in
the
bar
room
pettifog
owed
his
elevation
to
his
interest
at
an
election
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
his
subsequent
merits
will
be
as
promptly
rewarded
by
his
dismissal
from
a
bench
which
he
disgraces
and
defiles
by
his
presence
no
vi
anecdotes
as
we
mounted
our
horses
to
proceed
to
amherst
groups
of
country
people
were
to
be
seen
standing
about
pugnose
inn
talking
over
the
events
of
the
morning
while
others
were
dispersing
to
their
several
homes
a
pretty
prime
superfine
scoundrel
that
pettifog
said
the
clockmaker
he
and
his
constable
are
well
mated
and
travelled
in
the
same
gear
so
long
together
that
they
make
about
as
nice
a
yoke
of
rascals
as
you
meet
in
a
day
ride
they
pull
together
like
one
rope
reeved
through
two
blocks
that
constable
was
strangled
day
and
if
he
had
had
a
little
grain
more
wit
than
his
master
i
guess
he
had
his
stopped
as
tight
as
a
bladder
there
is
an
outlaw
of
a
feller
here
for
all
the
world
like
one
of
our
kentucky
squatters
one
bill
smith
a
critter
that
neither
fears
man
nor
devil
sheriff
and
constable
can
make
no
hand
of
him
they
ca
catch
him
no
how
and
if
they
do
come
up
with
him
he
slips
through
their
fingers
like
an
eel
and
then
he
goes
armed
and
he
can
knock
the
eye
out
of
a
squirrel
with
a
ball
at
fifty
yards
hand
running
a
regular
ugly
customer
well
nabb
the
constable
had
a
writ
agin
him
and
he
was
ciphering
a
good
while
how
he
should
catch
him
at
last
he
hit
on
a
plan
that
he
thought
was
pretty
clever
and
he
scheemed
for
a
chance
to
try
it
so
one
day
he
heerd
that
bill
was
up
at
pugnose
inn
some
business
and
was
likely
to
be
there
all
night
nabb
waits
till
it
was
considerable
late
in
the
evening
and
then
he
takes
his
horse
and
rides
down
to
the
inn
and
hitches
his
beast
behind
the
hay
stack
then
he
crawls
up
to
the
window
and
peeps
in
and
watches
there
till
bill
should
go
to
bed
thinking
the
best
way
to
catch
them
sort
of
animals
is
to
catch
them
asleep
well
he
kept
nabb
outside
so
long
with
his
talking
and
singing
that
he
well
nigh
fell
asleep
fist
himself
at
last
bill
began
to
strip
for
bed
first
he
takes
out
a
long
pocket
pistol
examines
the
priming
and
lays
it
down
on
the
table
near
the
head
of
the
bed
when
nabb
sees
this
he
begins
to
creep
like
all
over
and
feel
kinder
ugly
and
rather
sick
of
his
job
but
when
he
seed
him
jump
into
bed
and
heerd
him
snore
out
a
noise
like
a
man
driving
pigs
to
market
he
plucked
up
courage
and
thought
he
might
do
it
easy
arter
all
if
he
was
to
open
the
door
softly
and
make
one
spring
on
him
afore
he
could
wake
so
round
he
goes
lifts
up
the
latch
of
his
door
as
soft
as
soap
and
makes
a
jump
right
atop
of
him
as
he
lay
in
the
bed
guess
i
got
you
this
time
said
nabb
guess
so
too
said
bill
i
wish
you
would
lay
so
plaguy
heavy
on
me
jist
turn
over
that
a
good
fellow
will
you
with
that
bill
lays
his
arm
on
him
to
raise
him
up
for
he
said
he
was
squeezed
as
flat
as
a
pancake
and
afore
nabb
knew
where
he
was
bill
rolled
him
right
over
and
was
atop
of
him
then
he
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
twisted
his
pipe
till
his
eyes
were
as
big
as
saucers
and
his
tongue
grew
six
inches
longer
while
he
kept
making
faces
for
all
the
world
like
the
pirate
that
was
hanged
on
monument
hill
at
boston
it
was
pretty
near
over
with
him
when
nabb
thought
of
his
spurs
so
he
just
curled
up
both
heels
and
drove
the
spurs
right
into
him
he
let
him
have
it
jist
below
his
crupper
as
bill
was
naked
he
had
a
fair
chance
and
he
ragged
him
like
the
leaf
of
a
book
cut
open
with
your
finger
at
last
bill
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
let
go
his
hold
and
roared
like
a
bull
and
clapping
both
hands
ahind
him
he
out
of
the
door
like
a
shot
if
it
had
been
for
them
spurs
i
guess
bill
would
have
saved
the
hangman
a
job
of
nabb
that
time
the
clockmaker
was
an
observing
man
and
equally
communicative
nothing
escaped
his
notice
he
knew
everybody
genealogy
history
and
means
and
like
a
driver
of
an
english
was
not
unwilling
to
impart
what
he
knew
do
you
see
that
house
there
said
he
with
a
short
sarce
garden
afore
it
that
belongs
to
elder
thomson
the
elder
is
pretty
and
holds
special
fast
to
all
he
gets
he
is
a
just
man
and
very
pious
but
i
have
observed
when
a
man
becomes
near
about
too
good
he
is
apt
sometimes
to
slip
ahead
into
avarice
unless
he
looks
sharp
arter
his
girths
a
friend
of
mine
in
connecticut
an
old
sea
captain
who
was
once
let
in
for
it
pretty
deep
by
a
man
with
a
broader
brim
than
common
he
said
to
me
sam
i
do
like
those
folks
who
are
too
damned
good
there
is
i
expect
some
truth
in
it
tho
he
need
have
swore
at
all
but
he
was
an
awful
hand
to
swear
howsomever
that
may
be
there
is
a
story
about
the
elder
that
not
so
coarse
neither
it
appears
an
old
minister
came
there
once
to
hold
a
meetin
at
his
house
well
after
meetin
was
over
the
elder
took
the
minister
all
over
his
farm
which
is
pretty
tidy
i
tell
you
and
he
showed
him
a
great
ox
he
had
and
a
swingeing
big
pig
that
weighed
some
six
or
seven
hundred
weight
that
he
was
plaguy
proud
of
but
he
never
offered
the
old
minister
anything
to
eat
or
drink
the
preacher
was
pretty
tired
of
all
this
and
seeing
no
prospect
of
being
asked
to
partake
with
the
family
and
tolerably
sharp
set
he
asked
one
of
the
boys
to
fetch
him
his
horse
out
of
the
barn
when
he
was
taking
leave
of
the
elder
there
were
several
folks
by
at
the
time
says
he
thomson
you
have
a
fine
farm
here
a
very
fine
farm
indeed
you
have
a
large
ox
too
a
very
large
ox
and
i
think
said
he
seen
today
turning
and
looking
him
full
in
the
face
for
he
intended
to
hit
him
pretty
hard
think
i
have
seen
today
the
greatest
hog
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
the
neighbours
snickered
a
good
deal
and
the
elder
felt
pretty
streaked
i
guess
he
give
his
great
pig
or
his
great
ox
either
if
that
story
had
got
wind
no
vii
go
ahead
when
we
resumed
our
conversation
the
clockmaker
said
i
guess
we
are
the
greatest
nation
on
the
face
of
the
airth
and
the
most
enlightened
too
this
was
rather
too
arrogant
to
pass
unnoticed
and
i
was
about
replying
that
whatever
doubts
there
might
be
on
that
subject
there
could
be
none
whatever
that
they
were
the
most
modest
when
he
continued
we
ahead
the
nova
scotians
astarn
our
ships
go
ahead
of
the
ships
of
other
folks
our
steamboats
beat
the
british
in
speed
and
so
do
our
stage
coaches
and
i
reckon
a
real
right
down
new
york
trotter
might
stump
the
univarse
for
going
ahead
but
since
we
introduced
the
railroads
if
we
do
go
ahead
it
a
pity
we
never
fairly
knew
what
going
the
whole
hog
was
till
then
we
actilly
went
ahead
of
ourselves
and
that
no
easy
matter
i
tell
you
if
they
only
had
edication
here
they
might
learn
to
do
so
too
but
they
do
know
nothin
you
undervalue
them
said
i
they
have
their
college
and
academies
their
grammar
schools
and
primary
institutions
and
i
believe
there
are
few
among
them
who
can
not
read
and
write
i
guess
all
that
nothin
said
he
as
for
latin
and
greek
we
do
vally
it
a
cent
we
teach
it
and
so
we
do
painting
and
music
because
the
english
do
and
we
like
to
go
ahead
on
even
in
them
things
as
for
reading
it
well
enough
for
them
that
has
nothing
to
do
and
writing
is
plaguy
apt
to
bring
a
man
to
particularly
if
he
writes
his
name
so
like
another
man
as
to
have
it
mistaken
for
cyphering
is
the
thing
if
a
man
knows
how
to
cipher
he
is
sure
to
grow
rich
we
are
a
people
we
all
cipher
a
horse
that
wo
go
ahead
is
apt
to
run
back
and
the
more
you
whip
him
the
faster
he
goes
astarn
that
jist
the
way
with
the
nova
scotians
they
have
been
running
back
so
fast
lately
that
they
have
tumbled
over
a
bank
or
two
and
nearly
broke
their
necks
and
now
they
got
up
and
shook
themselves
they
swear
their
dirty
clothes
and
bloody
noses
are
all
owing
to
the
banks
i
guess
if
they
look
ahead
for
the
future
they
larn
to
look
behind
and
see
if
there
a
bank
near
hand
a
bear
always
goes
down
a
tree
starn
foremost
he
is
a
cunning
critter
he
knows
safe
to
carry
a
heavy
load
over
his
head
and
his
rump
is
so
heavy
he
do
like
to
trust
it
over
for
fear
it
might
take
a
lurch
and
carry
him
heels
over
head
to
the
ground
so
he
lets
his
starn
down
first
and
his
head
arter
i
wish
the
bluenoses
would
find
as
good
an
excuse
in
their
rumps
for
running
backwards
as
he
has
but
the
bear
he
knows
how
many
pounds
his
hams
weigh
and
he
if
he
carried
them
up
in
the
air
they
might
be
top
heavy
for
him
if
we
had
this
province
we
go
to
work
and
right
off
halifax
is
nothing
without
a
river
or
back
country
add
nothing
to
nothing
and
i
guess
you
have
nothing
still
add
a
railroad
to
the
bay
of
fundy
and
how
much
do
you
git
that
requires
ciphering
it
will
cost
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
or
thousand
pounds
your
money
add
for
notions
omitted
in
the
addition
column
one
third
and
it
makes
even
money
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
interest
at
five
per
cent
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
now
turn
over
the
slate
and
count
up
freight
i
make
it
upwards
of
thousand
pounds
a
year
if
i
had
you
at
the
desk
i
show
you
a
bill
of
items
now
comes
deduct
cost
of
engines
wear
and
tear
and
expenses
and
what
not
and
reduce
it
for
shortness
down
to
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
the
amount
of
interest
what
figures
have
you
got
now
you
have
an
investment
that
pays
interest
i
guess
and
if
it
do
pay
more
then
i
do
know
chalk
from
cheese
but
suppose
it
do
and
that
it
only
yields
two
and
a
half
per
cent
and
it
requires
good
ciphering
i
tell
you
to
say
how
it
would
act
with
folks
that
like
going
astarn
better
than
going
ahead
what
would
them
wise
ones
say
then
why
the
foolish
critters
would
say
it
pay
but
i
say
the
sum
ai
half
stated
can
you
count
in
your
head
not
to
any
extent
said
i
well
that
an
etarnal
pity
said
the
clockmaker
for
i
should
like
to
show
you
yankee
cyphering
what
is
the
entire
real
estate
of
halifax
worth
at
a
valeation
i
really
can
not
say
ah
said
he
i
see
you
do
cipher
and
latin
and
greek
wo
do
them
people
had
no
railroad
well
find
out
and
then
only
add
ten
per
cent
to
it
for
increased
value
and
if
it
do
give
the
cost
of
a
railroad
then
my
name
is
not
sam
slick
well
the
land
between
halifax
and
ardoise
is
worth
nothing
add
five
per
cent
to
that
and
send
the
sum
to
the
college
and
ax
the
students
how
much
it
comes
to
but
when
you
get
into
hants
county
i
guess
you
have
land
worth
coming
all
the
way
from
boston
to
see
his
royal
highness
the
king
i
guess
has
got
the
like
in
his
dominions
well
add
fifteen
per
cent
to
all
them
lands
that
border
on
windsor
basin
and
five
per
cent
to
what
on
basin
of
mines
and
then
what
do
you
get
a
pretty
considerable
sum
i
tell
you
but
it
no
use
to
give
you
the
chalks
if
you
ca
keep
the
tallies
now
we
will
lay
down
the
schoolmaster
assistant
and
take
up
another
book
every
bit
and
grain
as
good
as
that
although
these
folks
affect
to
sneer
at
it
i
mean
human
natur
ah
said
i
a
knowledge
of
that
was
of
great
service
to
you
certainly
in
the
sale
of
your
clock
to
the
old
deacon
let
us
see
how
it
will
assist
you
now
what
does
a
clock
want
that
run
down
said
he
undoubtedly
to
be
wound
up
i
replied
i
guess
you
hit
it
this
time
the
folks
of
halifax
have
run
down
and
they
never
go
to
all
eternity
till
they
are
wound
up
into
motion
the
works
are
all
good
and
it
is
plaguy
well
cased
and
set
it
only
wants
a
key
put
this
railroad
into
operation
and
the
activity
it
will
inspire
into
business
the
new
life
it
will
give
the
place
will
surprise
you
it
like
lifting
a
child
off
his
crawling
and
putting
him
on
his
legs
to
run
see
how
the
little
critter
goes
ahead
arter
that
a
kurnel
i
do
mean
a
kurnel
of
militia
for
we
do
vally
that
breed
o
cattle
nothing
they
do
nothing
but
strut
about
and
screech
all
day
like
peacocks
but
a
kurnel
of
grain
when
sowed
will
stool
into
several
shoots
and
each
shoot
hear
many
kurnels
and
will
multiply
itself
thus
four
times
one
is
four
and
four
times
is
one
hundred
you
see
all
natur
ciphers
except
the
bluenoses
jist
so
this
railroad
will
not
perhaps
beget
other
railroads
but
it
will
beget
a
spirit
of
enterprise
that
will
beget
other
useful
improvements
it
will
enlarge
the
sphere
and
the
means
of
trade
open
new
sources
of
traffic
and
supply
develop
resources
and
what
is
of
more
value
perhaps
than
all
beget
motion
it
will
stool
out
and
bear
abundantly
it
will
teach
the
folks
that
go
astarn
or
stand
stock
still
like
the
statehouse
in
boston
though
they
do
say
the
foundation
of
that
has
moved
a
little
this
summer
not
only
to
ahead
but
to
nullify
time
and
space
here
his
horse
who
feeling
the
animation
of
his
master
had
been
restive
of
late
set
off
at
a
most
prodigious
rate
of
trotting
it
was
some
time
before
he
was
reined
up
when
i
overtook
him
the
clockmaker
said
this
old
yankee
horse
you
see
understands
our
word
ahead
better
nor
these
bluenoses
what
is
it
he
continued
what
is
it
that
the
heels
of
a
young
country
and
hangs
like
poke
around
its
neck
what
retards
the
cultivation
of
its
soil
and
the
improvement
of
its
fisheries
the
high
price
of
labour
i
guess
well
what
a
railroad
the
substitution
of
mechanical
for
human
and
animal
labour
on
a
scale
as
grand
as
our
great
country
labour
is
dear
in
america
and
cheap
in
europe
a
railroad
therefore
is
comparatively
no
manner
of
use
to
them
to
what
it
is
to
us
it
does
wonders
there
but
it
works
miracles
here
there
it
makes
the
old
man
younger
but
here
it
makes
a
child
a
giant
to
us
it
is
river
bridge
road
and
canal
all
in
one
it
saves
what
we
hai
got
to
spare
men
horses
carts
vessels
barges
and
what
all
in
all
time
since
the
creation
of
the
universe
i
guess
it
the
greatest
invention
arter
man
now
this
is
what
i
call
arter
human
natur
while
figures
are
ciphering
arter
the
these
two
sorts
of
ciphering
make
edecation
and
you
may
depend
o
squire
there
is
nothing
like
folks
ciphering
if
they
want
to
ahead
no
viii
the
preacher
that
wandered
from
his
text
i
guess
said
the
clockmaker
we
know
more
of
nova
scotia
than
the
bluenoses
themselves
do
the
yankees
see
further
ahead
than
most
folks
they
can
see
round
side
of
a
thing
indeed
some
of
them
have
hurt
their
eyes
by
it
and
sometimes
i
think
the
reason
such
a
sight
of
them
wear
spectacles
the
first
i
ever
heerd
tell
of
cumberland
was
from
everett
of
congress
he
as
much
about
it
as
if
he
had
lived
here
all
his
days
and
maybe
a
little
grain
more
he
is
a
splendid
man
that
we
class
him
no
letter
a
one
night
i
chanced
to
go
into
general
peep
tavern
at
boston
and
who
should
i
see
there
but
the
great
everett
over
a
map
of
the
province
of
nova
scotia
it
possible
said
i
that
ai
professor
everett
as
i
am
alive
why
how
do
you
do
professor
well
i
give
you
thanks
said
he
be
you
but
i
ai
no
longer
professor
i
gin
that
up
and
also
the
trade
of
preaching
and
took
to
politics
do
say
so
said
i
what
on
airth
is
the
cause
o
that
says
he
here
slick
what
is
the
use
of
reading
the
proverbs
of
solomon
to
our
free
and
enlightened
citizens
that
are
every
mite
and
morsel
as
wise
as
he
was
that
man
undertook
to
say
there
was
nothing
new
under
the
sun
i
guess
he
think
he
spoke
a
little
too
fast
if
he
was
to
see
our
steamboats
railroads
and
india
rubber
shoes
three
inventions
worth
more
nor
all
he
knew
put
in
a
heap
together
i
do
know
said
i
somehow
or
another
i
guess
you
have
found
preaching
the
best
speculation
in
the
long
run
them
unitarians
pay
better
than
uncle
sam
we
call
said
the
clockmaker
the
american
public
uncle
sam
as
you
call
the
british
john
bull
that
remark
seemed
to
grig
him
a
little
he
felt
oneasy
like
and
walked
twice
across
the
room
fifty
fathoms
deep
in
thought
at
last
he
said
way
are
you
from
slick
this
hitch
says
i
run
away
up
south
in
nutmegs
hope
says
the
professor
were
a
good
article
the
real
right
down
genuine
thing
mistake
says
i
mistake
professor
they
were
all
prime
first
chop
but
why
did
you
ax
that
question
says
he
eternal
scoundrel
that
captain
john
allspice
of
nahant
he
used
to
trade
to
charleston
and
he
carried
a
cargo
once
there
of
fifty
barrels
of
nutmegs
well
he
put
half
a
bushel
of
good
ones
into
each
eend
of
the
barrel
and
the
rest
he
filled
up
with
wooden
ones
so
like
the
real
thing
no
soul
could
tell
the
difference
until
he
bit
one
with
his
teeth
and
that
he
never
thought
of
doing
until
he
was
first
bit
himself
well
it
been
a
standing
joke
with
them
southerners
agin
us
ever
since
was
only
day
at
washington
that
everlasting
virginny
duellist
general
cuffy
afore
a
number
of
senators
at
the
president
house
said
to
me
well
everett
says
he
you
know
i
was
always
dead
agin
your
tariff
bill
but
i
have
changed
my
mind
since
your
able
speech
on
it
i
shall
vote
for
it
now
give
me
your
hand
says
i
general
cuffy
the
boston
folks
will
be
dreadful
glad
when
they
hear
your
splendid
talents
are
on
our
side
i
think
it
will
go
now
we
carry
it
yes
says
he
your
factories
down
east
beat
all
natur
they
go
ahead
on
the
english
a
long
chalk
you
may
depend
i
was
glad
to
hear
the
new
englanders
spoken
of
that
way
i
felt
proud
i
tell
you
and
says
he
there
one
manufacture
that
might
stump
all
europe
to
produce
the
like
what
that
says
i
looking
as
pleased
all
the
time
as
a
gal
that
tickled
why
says
he
the
of
wooden
nutmegs
that
a
cap
sheef
that
bangs
the
bush
it
a
real
yankee
patent
invention
with
that
all
the
gentlemen
set
up
a
laugh
you
might
have
heerd
away
down
to
sandy
hook
and
the
gineral
like
a
great
the
half
nigger
half
looking
villain
as
he
is
i
tell
you
what
slick
said
the
professor
wish
with
all
my
heart
them
damned
nutmegs
were
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
that
was
the
first
oath
i
ever
heerd
him
let
slip
but
he
was
dreadful
riled
and
it
made
me
feel
ugly
too
for
it
awful
to
hear
a
minister
swear
and
the
only
match
i
know
for
it
is
to
hear
a
regular
sneezer
of
a
sinner
quote
scripture
says
i
everett
that
the
fruit
that
politics
bears
for
my
part
i
never
seed
a
good
graft
on
it
yet
that
bore
anything
good
to
eat
or
easy
to
digest
well
he
stood
awhile
looking
down
on
the
carpet
with
his
hands
behind
him
quite
taken
up
in
his
head
and
then
he
straightened
himself
up
and
he
put
his
hand
upon
his
heart
just
as
he
used
to
do
in
the
pulpit
he
looked
pretty
i
tell
you
and
slowly
lifting
his
hand
off
his
breast
he
said
slick
our
tree
of
liberty
was
a
beautiful
tree
a
splendid
tree
it
was
a
sight
to
look
at
it
was
well
fenced
and
well
protected
and
it
grew
so
stately
and
so
handsome
that
strangers
came
from
all
parts
of
the
globe
to
see
it
they
all
allowed
it
was
the
most
splendid
thing
in
the
world
well
the
mobs
have
broke
in
and
tore
down
the
fences
and
snapped
off
the
branches
and
scattered
all
the
leaves
about
and
it
looks
no
better
than
a
gallows
tree
i
am
afeared
said
he
tremble
to
think
on
it
but
i
am
afeared
our
ways
will
no
longer
be
ways
of
pleasantness
nor
our
paths
paths
of
peace
i
am
indeed
i
vow
mr
slick
he
looked
so
streaked
and
so
that
i
felt
kinder
sorry
for
him
i
actilly
thought
he
a
right
out
so
to
turn
the
conversation
says
i
what
great
map
is
that
i
seed
you
over
when
i
came
in
says
he
a
map
of
nova
scotia
that
says
he
a
valuable
province
a
real
clever
province
we
hai
got
the
like
on
it
but
it
most
plagily
in
our
way
says
i
for
sam
patch
that
man
was
a
great
diver
says
the
clockmaker
and
the
last
dive
he
took
was
off
the
falls
of
niagara
and
he
was
never
heerd
of
agin
till
day
when
captain
enoch
wentworth
of
the
susy
ann
whaler
saw
him
in
the
south
sea
says
captain
enoch
to
him
sam
says
he
on
airth
did
you
get
here
i
thought
you
was
drowned
at
the
canadian
lines
says
he
did
get
on
airth
here
at
all
but
i
came
right
slap
through
it
in
that
niagara
dive
i
went
so
everlasting
deep
i
thought
it
was
just
as
short
to
come
up
side
so
out
i
came
in
those
parts
if
i
do
take
the
shine
off
the
sea
serpent
when
i
get
back
to
boston
then
my
name
not
sam
patch
says
i
send
for
sam
patch
the
diver
and
let
him
dive
down
and
stick
a
torpedo
in
the
bottom
of
the
province
and
blow
it
up
or
if
that
wo
do
send
for
some
of
our
steam
towboats
from
our
great
eastern
cities
and
tow
it
out
to
sea
you
know
there
nothing
our
folks
ca
do
when
they
once
fairly
take
hold
on
a
thing
in
airnest
well
that
made
him
laugh
he
seemed
to
forget
about
the
nutmegs
and
says
he
a
bright
scheme
but
it
wo
do
we
shall
want
the
province
some
day
and
i
guess
we
buy
it
of
king
william
they
say
he
is
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
and
owes
nine
hundred
millions
of
pounds
starling
we
buy
it
as
we
did
florida
in
the
meantime
we
must
have
a
canal
from
bay
fundy
to
bay
varte
right
through
cumberland
neck
by
shittyack
for
our
fishing
vessels
to
go
to
labradore
guess
you
must
ax
leave
first
said
i
jist
what
i
was
ciphering
at
says
he
you
came
in
i
believe
we
wo
ax
them
at
all
but
jist
fall
to
and
do
it
it
a
road
of
needcessity
i
once
heard
chief
justice
marshall
of
baltimore
say
if
the
people
highway
is
dangerous
a
man
may
take
down
a
fence
and
pass
through
the
fields
as
a
way
of
needcessity
and
we
shall
do
it
on
that
principle
as
the
way
round
by
isle
sable
is
dangerous
i
wonder
the
nova
scotians
do
do
it
for
their
own
convenience
said
i
would
make
a
bad
speculation
that
critters
know
no
better
said
he
says
i
john
folks
why
do
they
for
they
are
pretty
cute
chaps
them
remind
me
says
the
professor
jim
billings
you
knew
jim
billings
did
you
mr
slick
yes
said
i
knew
him
it
was
he
that
made
such
a
talk
by
shipping
blankets
to
the
west
indies
same
says
he
i
went
to
see
him
the
other
day
at
lecain
and
says
i
billings
you
have
a
nice
location
here
a
plaguy
sight
too
nice
said
he
marm
lecain
makes
such
an
etarnal
touss
about
her
carpets
that
i
have
to
go
along
that
everlasting
long
entry
and
down
both
staircases
to
the
street
door
to
spit
and
it
keeps
all
the
gentlemen
with
their
mouths
full
all
day
i
had
a
real
bout
with
a
new
yorker
this
morning
i
run
down
to
the
street
door
and
afore
i
seed
anybody
i
let
go
and
i
vow
if
i
did
let
a
chap
have
it
all
over
his
white
waistcoat
well
he
makes
a
grab
at
me
and
i
shuts
the
door
right
to
on
his
wrist
and
hooks
the
door
chain
taught
and
leaves
him
there
and
into
marm
lecain
bedroom
like
a
shot
and
hides
behind
the
curtain
well
he
roared
like
a
bull
till
black
lucretia
one
of
the
let
him
go
and
they
looked
into
all
the
gentlemen
rooms
and
found
nobody
so
i
got
out
of
that
scrape
so
what
with
marm
lecain
carpets
in
the
house
and
other
folks
waistcoats
in
the
street
it
too
nice
a
location
for
me
i
guess
so
i
shall
up
killock
and
off
tomorrow
to
the
says
the
professor
john
folks
are
jist
like
billings
fifty
cents
would
have
bought
him
a
spit
box
and
saved
him
all
them
journeys
to
the
street
door
and
a
canal
at
bay
varte
would
save
the
john
folks
a
voyage
all
round
nova
scotia
why
they
ca
get
at
their
own
backside
settlements
without
a
voyage
most
as
long
as
one
to
europe
if
we
had
that
neck
of
land
in
cumberland
we
have
a
ship
canal
there
and
a
town
at
each
end
of
it
as
big
as
portland
you
may
talk
of
solomon
said
the
professor
if
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
a
lily
of
the
field
neither
was
he
in
all
his
wisdom
equal
in
knowledge
to
a
real
free
american
citizen
said
i
we
are
a
most
enlightened
people
that
sartain
but
somehow
i
do
like
to
hear
you
run
down
king
solomon
neither
perhaps
he
war
quite
so
wise
as
uncle
sam
but
then
said
i
drawing
close
to
the
professor
and
whispering
in
his
ear
for
fear
any
folks
in
the
bar
room
might
hear
me
then
said
i
may
be
he
was
every
bit
and
grain
as
honest
says
he
slick
there
are
some
folks
who
think
a
good
deal
and
say
but
little
and
they
are
wise
folks
and
there
are
others
agin
who
blart
right
out
whatever
comes
uppermost
and
i
guess
they
are
pretty
considerable
superfine
darned
fools
and
with
that
he
turned
right
round
and
sat
down
to
his
map
and
never
said
another
word
lookin
as
mad
as
a
hatter
the
whole
blessed
time
no
ix
yankee
eating
and
horse
feeding
did
you
ever
hear
tell
of
abernethy
a
british
doctor
said
the
clockmaker
frequently
said
i
he
was
an
eminent
man
and
had
a
most
extensive
practice
well
i
reckon
he
was
a
vulgar
critter
that
he
replied
he
treated
the
alden
gobble
secretary
to
our
legation
at
london
dreadful
bad
once
and
i
guess
if
it
had
been
me
he
had
used
that
way
i
a
fixed
his
flint
for
him
so
that
he
think
twice
afore
he
fire
such
another
shot
as
that
agin
i
a
made
him
make
tracks
i
guess
as
quick
as
a
dog
does
a
hog
from
a
potato
field
he
a
found
his
way
out
of
the
hole
in
the
fence
a
plaguy
sight
quicker
than
he
came
in
i
reckon
his
manner
said
i
was
certainly
rather
unceremonious
at
times
but
he
was
so
honest
and
so
straightforward
that
no
person
was
i
believe
ever
seriously
offended
at
him
it
was
his
way
then
his
way
was
so
plaguy
rough
continued
the
clockmaker
that
he
been
the
better
if
it
had
been
hammered
and
mauled
down
smoother
i
a
levelled
him
as
flat
as
a
flounder
pray
what
was
his
offence
said
i
bad
enough
you
may
depend
the
alden
gobble
was
dyspeptic
and
he
suffered
great
on
easiness
arter
eatin
so
he
gees
to
abemethy
for
advice
the
matter
with
you
said
the
doctor
jist
that
way
without
even
passing
the
time
o
day
with
him
the
matter
with
you
said
he
says
alden
presume
i
have
the
dyspepsy
said
he
see
a
yankee
swallowed
more
dollars
and
cents
than
he
can
digest
am
an
american
citizen
says
alden
with
great
dignity
am
secretary
to
our
legation
at
the
court
of
st
james
devil
you
are
said
abernethy
then
you
soon
get
rid
of
your
dyspepsy
do
see
that
inference
said
alden
do
follow
from
what
you
predicate
at
all
it
ai
a
natural
consequence
i
guess
that
a
man
should
cease
to
be
ill
because
he
is
called
by
the
voice
of
a
free
and
enlightened
people
to
fill
an
important
office
the
truth
is
you
could
no
more
trap
alden
than
you
could
an
indian
he
could
see
other
folks
trail
and
made
none
himself
he
was
a
real
diplomatist
and
i
believe
our
diplomatists
are
allowed
to
be
the
best
in
the
world
i
tell
you
it
does
follow
said
the
doctor
in
the
company
you
have
to
keep
you
have
to
eat
like
a
christian
it
was
an
everlasting
pity
alden
contradicted
him
for
he
broke
out
like
one
ravin
distracted
mad
be
damned
said
he
ever
i
saw
a
yankee
that
did
bolt
his
food
whole
like
a
boa
constrictor
how
the
devil
can
you
expect
to
digest
food
that
you
neither
take
the
trouble
to
dissect
nor
time
to
masticate
it
no
wonder
you
lose
your
teeth
for
you
never
use
them
nor
your
digestion
for
you
overload
it
nor
your
saliva
for
you
expend
it
on
the
carpets
instead
of
your
food
it
disgusting
it
beastly
you
yankees
load
your
stomachs
as
a
devonshire
man
does
his
cart
as
full
as
it
can
hold
and
as
fast
as
he
can
pitch
it
with
a
and
drive
off
and
then
you
complain
that
such
a
load
of
compost
is
too
heavy
for
you
dyspepsy
eh
infernal
guzzling
you
mean
i
tell
you
what
secretary
of
legation
take
half
the
time
to
eat
that
you
do
to
drawl
out
your
words
chew
your
food
half
as
much
as
you
do
your
filthy
tobacco
and
you
be
well
in
a
month
do
understand
such
language
said
alden
for
he
was
fairly
riled
and
got
his
dander
up
and
when
he
shows
clear
grit
he
looks
wicked
ugly
i
tell
you
do
understand
such
language
sir
i
came
here
to
consult
you
professionally
and
not
to
be
understand
said
the
doctor
it
plain
english
but
here
read
my
book
and
he
shoved
a
book
into
his
hands
and
left
him
in
an
instant
standing
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
room
if
the
alden
gobble
had
gone
right
away
and
demanded
his
passport
and
returned
home
with
the
legation
in
one
of
our
first
class
frigates
i
guess
the
english
would
as
soon
see
as
one
o
them
serpents
to
washington
the
president
and
the
people
would
have
sustained
him
in
it
i
guess
until
an
apology
was
offered
for
the
insult
to
the
nation
i
guess
if
it
had
been
me
said
slick
i
a
headed
him
afore
he
slipped
out
o
the
door
and
pinned
him
up
agin
the
wall
and
made
him
bolt
his
words
again
as
quick
as
he
throw
up
for
i
never
seed
an
englishman
that
did
cut
his
words
as
short
as
he
does
his
horse
tail
close
up
to
the
stump
it
certainly
was
very
coarse
and
vulgar
language
and
i
think
said
i
that
your
secretary
had
just
cause
to
be
offended
at
such
an
ungentlemanlike
attack
although
he
showed
his
good
sense
in
treating
it
with
the
contempt
it
deserved
it
was
plaguy
lucky
for
the
doctor
i
tell
you
that
he
cut
his
stick
as
he
did
and
made
himself
scarce
for
alden
was
an
ugly
customer
he
a
him
a
proper
scalding
he
a
taken
the
bristles
off
his
hide
as
clean
as
the
skin
of
a
spring
shote
of
a
pig
killed
at
christmas
the
clockmaker
was
evidently
excited
by
his
own
story
and
to
indemnify
himself
for
these
remarks
on
his
countrymen
he
indulged
for
some
time
in
ridiculing
the
nova
scotians
do
you
see
that
flock
of
colts
said
he
as
we
passed
one
of
those
beautiful
prairies
that
render
the
valleys
of
nova
scotia
so
verdant
and
so
fertile
well
i
guess
they
keep
too
much
of
that
stock
i
heerd
an
indian
one
day
ax
a
for
some
rum
joe
spawdeeck
said
he
reckon
you
have
got
too
much
already
much
of
anything
said
joe
not
good
but
too
much
rum
is
jist
enough
i
guess
these
bluenoses
think
so
about
their
horses
they
are
fairly
eat
up
by
them
out
of
house
and
home
and
they
are
no
good
neither
they
bea
good
saddle
horses
and
they
bea
good
draft
beasts
they
are
jist
neither
one
thing
nor
they
are
like
the
drink
of
our
connecticut
folks
at
mowing
time
they
use
molasses
and
water
nasty
stuff
only
fit
to
catch
flies
it
spiles
good
water
and
makes
bad
beer
no
wonder
the
folks
are
poor
look
at
them
great
dykes
well
they
all
go
to
feed
horses
and
look
at
their
grain
fields
on
the
upland
well
they
are
all
sowed
with
oats
to
feed
horses
and
they
buy
their
bread
from
us
so
we
feed
the
asses
and
they
feed
the
horses
if
i
had
them
critters
on
that
marsh
on
a
location
of
mine
i
jist
take
my
rifle
and
shoot
every
one
on
the
nasty
brutes
they
ai
worth
their
keep
one
winter
i
vow
i
wish
one
of
these
bluenoses
with
his
clothes
on
pinned
up
behind
like
a
leather
blind
of
a
shay
an
old
spur
on
one
heel
and
a
pipe
stuck
through
his
mounted
on
one
of
these
critters
that
moves
its
hind
legs
like
a
hen
scratchin
gravel
was
sot
down
in
broadway
in
new
york
for
a
sight
lord
i
think
i
hear
the
west
point
cadets
at
him
brought
that
out
of
standin
corn
and
stuck
him
here
guess
that
citizen
came
from
away
down
east
out
of
the
notch
of
the
white
mountains
comes
the
cholera
doctor
from
canada
not
from
canada
i
guess
neither
for
he
do
look
as
if
he
had
ever
been
among
the
rapids
if
they
would
poke
fun
at
him
it
a
pity
if
they
keep
less
horses
and
more
sheep
they
have
food
and
clothing
too
instead
of
buyin
both
i
vow
i
larfed
afore
now
till
i
have
fairly
wet
myself
to
see
one
of
these
folks
catch
a
horse
may
be
he
has
to
go
two
or
three
miles
of
an
arrand
well
down
he
goes
on
the
dyke
with
a
bridle
in
one
hand
and
an
old
tin
pan
in
another
full
of
oats
to
catch
his
beast
first
he
goes
to
one
flock
of
horses
and
then
to
another
to
see
if
he
can
find
his
own
critter
at
last
he
gets
sight
on
him
and
goes
softly
up
to
him
shakin
of
his
oats
and
him
and
jist
as
he
goes
to
put
his
hand
upon
him
away
he
starts
all
head
and
tail
and
the
rest
with
him
that
starts
another
flock
and
they
set
a
third
off
and
at
last
every
troop
on
goes
as
if
old
nick
was
arter
them
till
they
amount
to
two
or
three
hundred
in
a
drove
well
he
chases
them
clear
across
the
tantramer
marsh
seven
miles
good
over
ditches
creeks
mire
holes
and
flag
ponds
and
then
they
turn
and
take
a
fair
chase
for
it
back
again
seven
miles
more
by
this
time
i
presume
they
are
all
pretty
considerably
well
tired
and
bluenose
he
goes
and
gets
up
all
the
men
folks
in
the
neighbourhood
and
catches
his
beast
as
they
do
a
moose
arter
he
is
fairly
run
down
so
he
runs
fourteen
miles
to
ride
two
because
he
is
in
a
tarnation
hurry
it
equal
to
eatin
soup
with
a
fork
when
you
are
short
of
time
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
catching
birds
by
salt
on
their
tails
it
only
one
horse
a
man
can
ride
out
of
half
a
dozen
arter
all
one
has
no
shoes
has
a
colt
one
broke
another
has
a
sore
back
while
a
fifth
is
so
etarnal
cunnin
all
cumberland
could
catch
him
till
winter
drives
him
up
to
the
barn
for
food
most
of
them
dyke
marshes
have
what
they
call
pots
in
that
is
a
deep
hole
all
full
of
squash
where
you
ca
find
no
bottom
well
every
now
and
then
when
a
feller
goes
to
look
for
his
horse
he
sees
his
tail
right
out
an
eend
from
one
of
these
honey
pots
and
wavin
like
a
head
of
broom
corn
and
sometimes
you
see
two
or
three
trapped
there
smothered
tired
half
swimmin
half
wadin
like
rats
in
a
molasses
cask
when
they
find
in
that
pickle
they
go
and
get
ropes
and
tie
tight
round
their
necks
and
half
hang
to
make
float
and
then
haul
out
awful
lookin
critters
they
be
you
may
depend
when
they
do
come
out
for
all
the
world
like
kittens
all
slinkey
slimey
with
their
great
long
tails
glued
up
like
a
swab
of
oakum
dipped
in
tar
if
they
do
look
foolish
a
pity
well
they
have
to
nurse
these
critters
all
winter
with
hot
mashes
warm
covering
and
what
not
and
when
spring
comes
they
mostly
die
and
if
they
do
they
are
never
no
good
arter
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
half
the
horses
in
the
country
were
barrelled
up
in
these
here
pots
and
then
there
be
near
about
one
half
too
many
left
for
profit
jist
look
at
one
of
these
barn
yards
in
the
spring
half
a
dozen
colts
with
their
hair
lookin
a
thousand
ways
for
sunday
and
their
coats
hangin
in
tatters
and
half
a
dozen
old
horses
out
the
cows
and
sheep
can
you
wonder
that
people
who
keep
such
an
unprofitable
stock
come
out
of
the
small
eend
of
the
horn
in
the
long
run
no
x
the
road
to
a
woman
heart
the
broken
heart
as
we
approached
the
inn
at
amherst
the
clockmaker
grew
uneasy
it
pretty
well
on
in
the
evening
i
guess
said
he
and
marm
pugwash
is
as
onsartain
in
her
temper
as
a
mornin
in
april
it
all
sunshine
or
all
clouds
with
her
and
if
she
in
one
of
her
tantrums
she
stretch
out
her
neck
and
hiss
like
a
goose
with
a
flock
of
goslins
i
wonder
what
on
airth
pugwash
was
on
when
he
signed
articles
of
partnership
with
that
woman
she
not
a
piece
of
furniture
neither
and
it
a
proper
pity
sich
a
clever
woman
should
carry
such
a
stiff
upper
lip
she
reminds
me
of
our
old
minister
joshua
hopewell
apple
trees
the
old
minister
had
an
orchard
of
most
particular
good
fruit
for
he
was
a
great
hand
at
buddin
graftin
and
what
not
and
the
orchard
it
was
on
the
south
side
of
the
house
stretched
right
up
to
the
road
well
there
were
some
trees
hung
over
the
fence
i
never
seed
such
bearers
the
apples
hung
in
ropes
for
all
the
world
like
strings
of
onions
and
the
fruit
was
beautiful
nobody
touched
the
minister
apples
and
when
other
folks
lost
from
the
boys
always
hung
there
like
bait
to
a
hook
but
there
never
was
so
much
as
a
nibble
at
so
i
said
to
him
one
day
said
i
on
airth
do
you
manage
to
keep
your
fruit
that
so
exposed
when
no
one
else
can
do
it
no
how
says
he
are
dreadful
pretty
fruit
ai
they
guess
said
i
the
like
on
in
all
connecticut
says
he
tell
you
the
secret
but
you
need
let
on
to
no
one
about
it
that
row
next
the
fence
i
grafted
it
myself
i
took
great
pains
to
get
the
right
kind
i
sent
clean
up
to
roxberry
and
away
down
to
creek
for
know
that
minister
said
i
for
i
was
afeared
he
was
to
give
me
day
and
date
for
every
graft
being
a
terrible
man
in
his
stories
know
that
said
i
how
do
you
preserve
them
i
was
to
tell
you
said
he
you
stopped
me
that
outward
row
i
grafted
myself
with
the
choicest
kind
i
could
find
and
i
succeeded
they
are
beautiful
but
so
etarnal
sour
no
human
soul
can
eat
them
well
the
boys
think
the
old
minister
graftin
has
all
succeeded
about
as
well
as
that
row
and
they
sarch
no
farther
they
snicker
at
my
graftin
and
i
laugh
in
my
sleeve
i
guess
at
their
penetration
now
marm
pugwash
is
like
the
minister
apples
very
temptin
fruit
to
look
at
but
desperate
sour
if
pugwash
had
a
watery
mouth
when
he
married
i
guess
it
pretty
puckery
by
this
time
however
if
she
goes
to
act
ugly
i
give
her
a
dose
of
sawder
that
will
take
the
frown
out
of
her
frontispiece
and
make
her
as
smooth
as
a
lick
of
copal
varnish
it
a
pity
she
such
a
devil
too
for
she
has
good
points
good
eye
good
foot
neat
pastern
fine
chest
a
clean
set
of
limbs
and
carries
a
good
but
here
we
are
now
you
see
what
sawder
will
do
when
we
entered
the
house
the
traveller
room
was
all
in
darkness
and
on
opening
the
opposite
door
into
the
we
found
the
female
part
of
the
family
extinguishing
the
fire
for
the
night
pugwash
had
a
broom
in
her
hand
and
was
in
the
act
the
last
act
of
female
housewifery
of
sweeping
the
hearth
the
strong
flickering
light
of
the
fire
as
it
fell
upon
her
tall
fine
figure
and
beautiful
face
revealed
a
creature
worthy
of
the
clockmaker
comments
good
evening
marm
said
slick
how
do
you
do
and
how
mr
pugwash
he
said
she
why
he
been
abed
this
hour
you
do
expect
to
disturb
him
this
time
of
night
i
hope
oh
no
said
mr
stick
certainly
not
and
i
am
sorry
to
have
disturbed
you
but
we
got
detained
longer
than
we
expected
i
am
sorry
that
so
am
i
said
she
but
if
pugwash
will
keep
an
inn
when
he
has
no
occasion
to
his
family
ca
expect
no
rest
here
the
clockmaker
seeing
the
storm
gathering
stooped
down
suddenly
and
staring
intently
held
out
his
hand
and
exclaimed
well
if
that
ai
a
beautiful
child
come
here
my
little
man
and
shake
hands
along
with
me
well
i
declare
if
that
little
feller
ai
the
finest
child
i
ever
seed
what
not
abed
yet
ah
you
rogue
where
did
you
get
them
pretty
rosy
cheeks
stole
from
mamma
eh
well
i
wish
my
old
mother
could
see
that
child
it
is
such
a
treat
in
our
country
said
he
turning
to
me
the
children
are
all
as
pale
as
chalk
or
as
yeller
as
an
orange
lord
that
little
feller
would
be
a
show
in
our
country
come
to
me
my
man
here
the
soft
sawder
began
to
operate
pugwash
said
in
a
milder
tone
than
we
had
yet
heard
go
my
dear
to
the
gentleman
go
dear
slick
kissed
him
asked
him
if
he
would
go
to
the
states
along
with
him
told
him
all
the
little
girls
there
would
fall
in
love
with
him
for
they
did
see
such
a
beautiful
face
once
in
a
month
of
sundays
black
eyes
let
me
see
ah
mamma
eyes
too
and
black
hair
also
as
i
am
alive
why
you
are
mamma
own
boy
the
very
image
of
mamma
do
be
seated
gentlemen
said
pugwash
sally
make
a
fire
in
the
next
room
she
ought
to
be
proud
of
you
he
continued
well
if
i
live
to
return
here
i
must
paint
your
face
and
have
it
put
on
my
clocks
and
our
folks
will
buy
the
clocks
for
the
sake
of
the
face
did
you
ever
see
said
he
again
addressing
me
such
a
likeness
between
one
human
and
another
as
between
this
beautiful
little
boy
and
his
mother
i
am
sure
you
have
had
no
supper
said
pugwash
to
me
you
must
be
hungry
and
weary
too
i
will
get
you
a
cup
of
tea
i
am
sorry
to
give
you
so
much
trouble
said
i
not
the
least
trouble
in
the
world
she
replied
on
the
contrary
a
pleasure
we
were
then
shown
into
the
next
room
where
the
fire
was
now
blazing
up
but
slick
protested
he
could
not
proceed
without
the
little
boy
and
lingered
behind
me
to
ascertain
his
age
and
concluded
by
asking
the
child
if
he
had
any
aunts
that
looked
like
mamma
as
the
door
closed
slick
said
it
a
pity
she
do
go
well
in
gear
the
difficulty
with
those
critters
is
to
get
them
to
start
arter
that
there
is
no
trouble
with
them
if
you
do
check
too
short
if
you
do
they
stop
again
run
back
and
kick
like
mad
and
then
old
nick
himself
would
start
pugwash
i
guess
understand
the
natur
of
the
critter
she
never
go
kind
in
harness
for
him
when
i
see
a
child
said
the
clockmaker
i
always
feel
safe
with
these
women
folk
for
i
have
always
found
that
the
road
to
a
woman
heart
lies
through
her
child
you
seem
said
i
to
understand
the
female
heart
so
well
i
make
no
doubt
you
are
a
general
favourite
among
the
fair
sex
any
man
he
replied
that
understands
horses
has
a
pretty
considerable
fair
knowledge
of
women
too
for
they
are
jist
alike
in
temper
and
require
the
very
identical
same
treatment
encourage
the
timid
ones
be
gentle
and
steady
with
the
fractious
but
lather
the
sulky
ones
like
blazes
people
talk
an
everlastin
sight
of
nonsense
about
wine
women
and
horses
i
bought
and
sold
all
i
traded
in
all
of
them
and
i
tell
you
there
ai
one
in
a
thousand
that
knows
a
grain
about
either
on
you
hear
folks
say
oh
such
a
man
is
an
critter
he
break
his
wife
heart
jist
as
if
a
woman
heart
was
as
brittle
as
a
pipe
stalk
the
female
heart
as
far
as
my
experience
goes
is
jist
like
a
new
india
rubber
shoe
you
may
pull
and
pull
at
it
till
it
stretches
out
a
yard
long
and
then
let
go
and
it
will
fly
right
back
to
its
old
shape
their
hearts
are
made
of
stout
leather
i
tell
you
there
a
plaguy
sight
of
wear
in
i
never
knowed
but
one
case
of
a
broken
heart
and
that
was
in
sex
one
washington
banks
he
was
a
sneezer
he
was
tall
enough
to
spit
down
on
the
heads
of
your
grenadiers
and
near
about
high
enough
to
wade
across
charlestown
river
and
as
strong
as
a
towboat
i
guess
he
was
somewhat
less
than
a
foot
longer
than
the
moral
law
and
catechism
too
he
was
a
perfect
pictur
of
a
man
you
could
falt
him
in
no
particular
he
was
so
just
a
made
critter
folks
used
to
run
to
the
winder
when
he
passed
and
say
goes
washington
banks
bea
he
lovely
i
do
believe
there
was
a
gal
in
the
lowell
factories
that
war
in
love
with
him
sometimes
at
intermission
on
sabbath
day
when
they
all
came
out
together
an
amazin
hansom
sight
too
near
about
a
whole
congregation
of
young
gals
banks
used
to
say
vow
young
ladies
i
wish
i
had
five
hundred
arms
to
reciprocate
one
with
each
of
you
but
i
reckon
i
have
a
heart
big
enough
for
you
all
it
a
whapper
you
may
depend
and
every
mite
and
morsel
of
it
at
your
service
well
how
you
do
act
banks
half
a
thousand
little
tongues
would
say
all
at
the
same
time
and
their
dear
little
eyes
sparklin
like
so
many
stars
twinklin
of
a
frosty
night
well
when
i
last
seed
him
he
was
all
skin
and
bone
like
a
horse
turned
out
to
die
he
was
teetotally
defleshed
a
mere
skeleton
am
dreadful
sorry
says
i
see
you
banks
so
peecked
why
you
look
like
a
sick
turkey
hen
all
legs
what
on
airth
ails
you
dyin
says
he
a
broken
heart
says
i
the
gals
been
jiltin
you
no
says
he
bea
such
a
fool
as
that
neither
says
i
you
made
a
bad
speculation
says
he
shakin
his
head
hope
i
have
too
much
clear
grit
in
me
to
take
on
so
bad
for
that
under
the
sun
is
it
then
said
i
says
he
made
a
bet
the
fore
part
of
summer
with
leftenant
oby
knowles
that
i
could
shoulder
the
best
bower
of
the
constitution
frigate
i
won
my
bet
but
the
anchor
was
so
eternal
heavy
it
broke
my
heart
sure
enough
he
did
die
that
very
fall
and
he
was
the
only
instance
i
ever
heerd
tell
of
a
broken
heart
no
xi
cumberland
oysters
produce
melancholy
forebodings
the
soft
sawder
of
the
clockmaker
had
operated
effectually
on
the
beauty
of
amherst
our
lovely
hostess
of
pugwash
inn
indeed
i
am
inclined
to
think
with
slick
that
the
road
to
a
woman
heart
lies
through
her
child
from
the
effect
produced
upon
her
by
the
praises
bestowed
on
her
infant
boy
i
was
musing
on
this
feminine
susceptibility
to
flattery
when
the
door
opened
and
pugwash
entered
dressed
in
her
sweetest
smiles
and
her
best
cap
an
auxiliary
by
no
means
required
by
her
charms
which
like
an
italian
sky
when
unclouded
are
unrivalled
in
splendour
approaching
me
she
said
with
an
irresistible
smile
would
you
like
here
there
was
a
pause
a
hiatus
evidently
intended
for
me
to
fill
up
with
my
name
but
that
no
person
knows
nor
do
i
intend
they
shall
at
medley
hotel
in
halifax
i
was
known
as
the
stranger
in
no
the
attention
that
incognito
procured
for
me
the
importance
it
gave
me
in
the
eyes
of
the
master
of
the
house
its
lodgers
and
servants
is
indescribable
it
is
only
great
people
who
travel
incog
state
travelling
is
inconvenient
and
slow
the
constant
weight
of
form
and
etiquette
oppresses
at
once
the
strength
and
the
spirits
it
is
pleasant
to
travel
unobserved
to
stand
at
ease
or
exchange
the
full
suit
for
the
undress
coat
and
fatigue
jacket
wherever
too
there
is
mystery
there
is
importance
there
is
no
knowing
for
whom
i
may
be
mistaken
but
let
me
once
give
my
humble
cognomen
and
occupation
and
i
sink
immediately
to
my
own
level
to
a
plebeian
station
and
a
vulgar
name
not
even
my
beautiful
hostess
nor
my
inquisitive
friend
the
clockmaker
who
calls
me
squire
shall
extract
that
secret
would
you
like
indeed
i
would
said
i
pugwash
pray
be
seated
and
tell
me
what
it
is
would
you
like
a
dish
of
superior
shittyacks
for
supper
indeed
i
would
said
i
again
laughing
but
pray
tell
me
what
it
is
laws
me
said
she
with
a
stare
where
have
you
been
all
your
days
that
you
never
heerd
of
our
shittyack
oysters
i
thought
everybody
had
heerd
of
them
i
beg
pardon
said
i
but
i
understood
at
halifax
that
the
only
oysters
in
this
part
of
the
world
were
found
on
the
shores
of
prince
edward
island
oh
dear
no
said
our
hostess
they
are
found
all
along
the
coast
from
shittyack
through
bay
of
vartes
away
up
to
ramshag
the
latter
we
seldom
get
though
the
best
there
is
no
regular
conveyance
and
when
they
do
come
they
are
generally
shelled
and
in
kegs
and
never
in
good
order
i
have
not
had
a
real
good
ramshag
in
my
house
these
two
years
since
governor
maitland
was
here
he
was
amazin
fond
of
them
and
lawyer
talkemdeaf
sent
his
carriage
there
on
purpose
to
procure
them
fresh
for
him
now
we
ca
get
them
but
we
have
the
shittyacks
in
perfection
say
the
word
and
they
shall
be
served
up
immediately
a
good
dish
and
an
unexpected
dish
is
most
acceptable
and
certainly
my
american
friend
and
myself
did
ample
justice
to
the
oysters
which
if
they
have
not
so
classical
a
name
have
quite
as
good
a
flavour
as
their
far
famed
brethren
of
milton
slick
ate
so
heartily
that
when
he
resumed
his
conversation
he
indulged
in
the
most
melancholy
forebodings
did
you
see
that
nigger
said
he
that
removed
the
oyster
shells
well
he
one
of
our
chesapickers
one
of
general
slaves
i
wish
admiral
cockburn
had
a
taken
them
all
off
our
hands
at
the
same
time
we
made
a
pretty
good
sale
of
them
black
cattle
i
guess
to
the
british
i
wish
we
were
well
rid
of
all
the
blacks
and
the
whites
in
the
states
show
their
teeth
and
snarl
they
are
jist
ready
to
fall
to
the
protestants
and
catholics
begin
to
lay
back
their
ears
and
turn
tail
for
kickin
the
abolitionists
and
planters
are
at
it
like
two
bulls
in
a
pastur
and
are
working
like
yeast
in
a
barrel
and
frothing
at
the
bung
hole
nullification
and
tariff
are
like
a
charcoal
pit
all
covered
up
but
burning
inside
and
sending
out
smoke
at
every
crack
enough
to
stifle
a
horse
general
government
and
state
government
every
now
and
then
square
off
and
sparr
and
the
first
blow
given
will
bring
a
genuine
surplus
revenue
is
another
bone
of
contention
like
a
shin
of
beef
thrown
among
a
pack
of
dogs
it
will
set
the
whole
on
by
the
ears
you
have
heerd
tell
of
cotton
rags
dipped
in
turpentine
you
how
they
produce
combustion
well
i
guess
we
have
the
elements
of
spontaneous
combustion
among
us
in
abundance
when
it
does
break
out
if
you
do
see
an
eruption
of
human
gore
worse
than
etna
lava
then
i
mistaken
there
be
the
very
devil
to
pay
a
fact
i
expect
the
blacks
will
butcher
the
southern
whites
and
the
northerners
will
have
to
turn
out
and
butcher
them
again
and
all
this
shoot
hang
cut
stab
and
burn
business
will
sweeten
our
folks
temper
as
raw
meat
does
that
of
a
dog
it
fairly
makes
me
sick
to
think
on
it
the
explosion
may
clear
the
air
again
and
all
be
tranquil
once
more
but
it
an
even
chance
if
it
do
leave
us
the
three
steamboat
options
to
be
blown
sky
high
to
be
scalded
to
death
or
drowned
if
this
sad
picture
you
have
drawn
be
indeed
true
to
nature
how
does
your
country
said
i
appear
so
attractive
as
to
draw
to
it
so
large
a
portion
of
our
population
it
ai
its
attraction
said
the
clockmaker
it
nothin
but
its
power
of
suction
it
is
a
great
whirlpool
a
great
vortex
it
drags
all
the
straw
and
chips
and
floatin
sticks
and
trash
into
it
the
small
crafts
are
sucked
in
and
whirl
round
and
round
like
a
squirrel
in
a
cage
they
never
come
out
bigger
ones
pass
through
at
certain
times
of
tide
and
can
come
in
and
out
with
good
pilotage
as
they
do
at
hell
gate
up
the
sound
you
astonish
me
said
i
beyond
measure
both
your
previous
conversations
with
me
and
the
concurrent
testimony
of
all
my
friends
who
have
visited
the
states
give
a
different
view
of
it
your
friends
said
the
clockmaker
with
such
a
tone
of
ineffable
contempt
that
i
felt
a
strong
inclination
to
knock
him
down
for
his
insolence
your
friends
ensigns
and
leftenants
i
guess
from
the
british
marchin
regiments
in
the
colonies
that
run
over
five
thousand
miles
of
country
in
five
weeks
on
leave
of
absence
and
then
return
lookin
as
wise
as
the
monkey
that
had
seen
the
world
when
they
get
back
they
are
so
chock
full
of
knowledge
of
the
yankees
that
it
runs
over
of
itself
like
a
hogshead
of
molasses
rolled
about
in
hot
weather
a
white
froth
and
scum
bubbles
out
of
the
bung
trash
they
call
tours
sketches
travels
letters
and
what
not
vapid
stuff
jist
sweet
enough
to
catch
flies
cockroaches
and
gals
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
my
french
i
larnt
french
at
night
school
one
winter
of
our
minister
joshua
hopewell
he
was
the
most
larned
man
of
the
age
for
he
taught
himself
every
language
in
europe
well
next
spring
when
i
went
to
boston
i
met
a
frenchman
and
i
began
to
jabber
away
french
to
him
woes
a
french
say
says
i
do
understand
yankee
yet
says
he
do
understand
says
i
french
i
guess
you
did
expect
to
hear
such
good
french
did
you
away
down
east
here
but
we
speak
it
real
well
and
it
generally
allowed
we
speak
english
too
better
than
the
british
says
he
one
very
droll
yankee
dat
very
good
joke
sare
you
talk
indian
and
call
it
french
says
i
mount
shear
it
is
french
i
vow
real
merchantable
without
wainy
edge
or
shakes
all
clear
stuff
it
will
pass
survey
in
any
market
it
ready
stuck
and
seasoned
very
like
says
he
bowin
as
polite
as
a
black
waiter
at
new
orleens
like
only
i
never
heerd
it
afore
oh
very
good
french
dat
clear
stuff
no
doubt
but
i
no
understand
all
my
fault
i
dare
say
sare
thinks
i
to
myself
a
nod
is
as
good
as
a
wink
to
a
blind
horse
i
see
how
the
cat
jumps
minister
knows
so
many
languages
he
been
particular
enough
to
keep
in
separate
parcels
and
mark
on
the
back
and
they
got
mixed
and
sure
enough
i
found
my
french
was
so
overrun
with
other
sorts
that
it
was
better
to
lose
the
whole
crop
than
to
go
to
weedin
for
as
fast
as
i
pulled
up
any
strange
seedlin
it
would
grow
right
up
agin
as
quick
as
wink
if
there
was
the
least
bit
of
root
in
the
world
left
in
the
ground
so
i
let
it
all
rot
on
the
field
there
is
no
way
so
good
to
larn
french
as
to
live
among
and
if
you
want
to
understand
us
you
must
live
among
us
too
your
halls
hamiltons
and
de
rouses
and
such
critters
what
can
they
know
of
us
can
a
chap
catch
a
likeness
flyin
along
a
railroad
can
he
even
see
the
feature
old
admiral
anson
once
axed
one
of
our
folks
afore
our
glorious
revolution
if
the
british
had
a
known
us
a
little
grain
better
at
that
time
they
would
have
got
whipped
like
a
sack
as
they
did
then
where
he
came
from
the
chesapeeke
said
he
aye
said
the
admiral
the
west
indies
guess
said
the
southaner
may
have
been
clean
round
the
world
admiral
but
you
have
been
plaguy
little
in
it
not
to
know
better
nor
that
i
shot
a
wild
goose
at
river
philip
last
year
with
the
rice
of
varginny
fresh
in
his
crop
he
must
have
cracked
on
near
about
as
fast
as
them
other
geese
the
british
travellers
which
know
the
most
of
the
country
they
passed
over
do
you
suppose
i
guess
it
was
much
of
a
muchness
near
about
six
of
one
and
a
half
dozen
of
two
eyes
ai
much
better
than
one
if
they
are
both
blind
no
if
you
want
to
know
all
about
us
and
the
bluenoses
a
pretty
considerable
share
of
yankee
blood
in
them
too
i
tell
you
the
old
stock
comes
from
new
england
and
the
breed
is
tolerable
pure
yet
near
about
one
half
apple
sarce
and
half
molasses
all
except
to
the
where
there
is
a
cross
of
the
scotch
jist
ax
me
and
i
tell
you
candidly
i
not
one
of
them
that
ca
see
no
good
points
in
my
neighbour
critter
and
no
bad
ones
in
my
own
i
seen
too
much
of
the
world
for
that
i
guess
indeed
in
a
general
way
i
praise
other
folks
beasts
and
keep
dark
about
my
own
says
i
when
i
meet
bluenose
mounted
a
real
smart
horse
of
put
him
out
i
guess
he
trot
like
mad
well
he
lets
him
have
the
spur
and
the
critter
does
his
best
and
then
i
pass
him
like
a
streak
of
lightning
with
mine
the
feller
looks
all
taken
aback
at
that
says
he
a
real
clipper
of
i
vow
says
i
quite
cool
as
if
i
had
heard
that
same
thing
a
thousand
times
good
enough
for
me
jist
a
fair
trotter
and
nothin
to
brag
of
that
goes
near
about
as
far
agin
in
a
general
way
as
a
crackin
and
a
boastin
does
never
tell
folks
you
can
go
a
head
on
but
do
it
it
spares
a
great
deal
of
talk
and
helps
them
to
save
their
breath
to
cool
their
broth
no
if
you
want
to
know
the
inns
and
the
outs
of
the
yankees
wintered
them
and
summered
them
i
know
all
their
points
shape
make
and
breed
i
tried
alongside
of
other
folks
and
i
know
where
they
fall
short
where
they
mate
and
where
they
have
the
advantage
about
as
well
as
some
who
think
they
know
a
plaguy
sight
more
it
ai
them
that
stare
the
most
that
see
the
best
always
i
guess
our
folks
have
their
faults
and
i
know
them
i
war
born
blind
i
reckon
but
your
friends
the
tour
writers
are
a
little
grain
too
hard
on
us
our
old
nigger
wench
had
several
dirty
children
and
was
proper
cross
to
mother
used
to
say
it
better
never
to
wipe
a
child
nose
at
all
i
guess
than
to
wring
it
off
no
xii
the
american
eagle
jist
look
out
of
the
door
said
the
clockmaker
and
see
what
a
beautiful
night
it
is
how
calm
how
still
how
clear
it
is
it
lovely
i
like
to
look
up
at
them
stars
when
i
am
away
from
home
they
put
me
in
mind
of
our
national
flag
and
it
is
generally
allowed
to
be
the
first
flag
in
the
univarse
now
the
british
can
whip
all
the
world
and
we
can
whip
the
british
it
near
about
the
prettiest
sight
i
know
of
is
one
of
our
first
class
frigates
manned
with
our
free
and
enlightened
citizens
all
ready
for
sea
it
like
the
great
american
eagle
on
its
perch
balancing
itself
for
a
start
on
the
broad
expanse
of
blue
sky
afeared
of
nothin
of
its
kind
and
president
of
all
it
surveys
it
was
a
good
emblem
that
we
chose
war
it
there
was
no
evading
so
direct
and
at
the
same
time
so
conceited
an
appeal
as
this
certainly
said
i
the
emblem
was
well
chosen
i
was
particularly
struck
with
it
on
observing
the
device
on
your
naval
buttons
during
the
last
war
an
eagle
with
an
anchor
in
its
claws
that
was
a
natural
idea
taken
from
an
ordinary
occurrence
a
bird
purloining
the
anchor
of
a
frigate
an
article
so
useful
and
necessary
for
the
food
of
its
young
it
was
well
chosen
and
exhibited
great
taste
and
judgment
in
the
artist
the
emblem
is
more
appropriate
than
you
are
aware
of
boasting
of
what
you
can
not
perform
grasping
at
what
you
can
not
attain
an
emblem
of
arrogance
and
weakness
of
ambition
and
vulgar
pretension
it
a
common
phrase
said
he
with
great
composure
among
seamen
to
say
your
buttons
and
i
guess
it
natural
for
you
to
say
so
of
the
buttons
of
our
navals
i
guess
you
have
a
right
to
that
oath
it
a
sore
subject
that
i
reckon
and
i
believe
i
had
ought
to
have
spoken
of
it
to
you
at
all
brag
is
a
good
dog
but
hold
fast
is
a
better
one
he
was
evidently
annoyed
and
with
his
usual
dexterity
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
by
a
sally
upon
the
bluenoses
who
he
says
are
a
cross
of
english
and
yankee
and
therefore
first
cousins
to
us
both
perhaps
said
he
that
eagle
might
with
more
propriety
have
been
taken
off
as
perched
on
an
anchor
instead
of
holding
it
in
his
claws
and
i
think
it
would
have
been
more
nateral
but
i
suppose
it
was
some
stupid
foreign
artist
that
made
that
blunder
i
never
seed
one
yet
that
was
equal
to
if
that
eagle
is
represented
as
trying
what
he
ca
do
it
an
honourable
ambition
arter
all
but
these
bluenoses
wo
try
what
they
can
do
they
put
me
in
mind
of
a
great
big
hulk
of
a
horse
in
a
cart
that
wo
put
his
shoulder
to
the
collar
at
all
for
all
the
lambastin
in
the
world
but
turns
his
head
round
and
looks
at
you
as
much
as
to
say
an
heavy
thing
an
empty
cart
is
isnt
it
an
owl
should
be
their
emblem
and
the
motto
sleeps
all
the
days
of
his
life
the
whole
country
is
like
this
night
beautiful
to
look
at
but
silent
as
the
grave
still
as
death
asleep
becalmed
if
the
sea
was
always
calm
said
he
it
would
pyson
the
univarse
no
soul
could
breathe
the
air
it
would
be
so
uncommon
bad
stagnant
water
is
always
unpleasant
but
salt
water
when
it
gets
tainted
beats
all
natur
motion
keeps
it
sweet
and
wholesome
and
that
our
minister
used
to
say
is
one
of
the
of
the
great
deep
this
province
is
stagnant
it
ai
deep
like
still
water
neither
for
it
shaller
enough
gracious
knows
but
it
is
motionless
noiseless
lifeless
if
you
have
ever
been
to
sea
in
a
calm
you
know
what
a
plaguy
tiresome
thing
it
is
for
a
man
that
in
a
hurry
an
everlastin
flappin
of
the
sails
and
a
creakin
of
the
boombs
and
an
onsteady
pitchin
of
the
ship
and
folks
lyin
about
dozin
away
their
time
and
the
sea
a
long
heavy
swell
like
the
breathin
of
the
chist
of
some
great
monster
asleep
a
passenger
wonders
the
sailors
are
so
plagy
easy
about
it
and
he
goes
out
east
and
out
west
to
see
if
there
any
chance
of
a
breeze
and
says
to
himself
if
this
ai
dull
music
it
a
pity
then
how
streaked
he
feels
when
he
sees
a
steamboat
it
by
him
like
mad
and
the
folks
on
board
pokin
fun
at
him
and
askin
him
if
he
has
any
word
to
send
to
home
he
says
any
soul
ever
catches
me
on
board
a
sail
vessel
again
when
i
can
go
by
steam
i
give
him
leave
to
tell
me
of
it
that
a
fact
that
partly
the
case
here
they
are
becalmed
and
they
see
us
going
ahead
on
them
till
we
are
clean
out
of
sight
yet
they
hai
got
a
steamboat
and
they
hai
got
a
railroad
indeed
i
doubt
if
one
half
on
ever
seed
or
heerd
tell
of
one
or
of
them
i
never
seed
any
folks
like
except
the
indians
and
they
wo
even
so
much
as
look
they
hav
the
least
morsel
of
curiosity
in
the
world
from
which
one
of
our
unitarian
preachers
they
are
dreadful
hands
at
doubtin
them
i
do
doubt
but
some
day
or
another
they
will
doubt
whether
everything
ai
a
doubt
in
a
very
learned
work
doubts
whether
they
were
ever
descended
from
eve
at
all
old
marm
eve
children
he
says
are
all
lost
it
is
said
in
consequence
of
too
much
curiosity
while
these
copper
coloured
folks
are
lost
from
havin
too
little
little
how
can
they
be
the
same
thinks
i
that
may
be
logic
old
dubersome
but
it
ai
sense
do
extremes
meet
now
these
bluenoses
have
no
motion
in
no
enterprise
no
spirit
and
if
any
critter
shows
any
symptoms
of
activity
they
say
he
is
a
man
of
no
judgment
he
speculative
a
schemer
in
short
he
mad
they
vegitate
like
a
lettuce
plant
in
sarse
garden
they
grow
tall
and
spindlin
run
to
seed
right
off
grow
as
bitter
as
gaul
and
die
a
gal
once
came
to
our
minister
to
hire
as
a
says
she
i
suppose
you
do
want
a
young
lady
to
do
chamber
business
and
breed
worms
do
you
for
i
half
a
mind
to
take
a
spell
of
livin
out
she
meant
said
the
clockmaker
house
work
and
rearing
pretty
maiden
says
he
her
on
the
cheek
for
i
often
observed
old
men
always
talk
kinder
pleasant
to
young
women
pretty
maiden
where
was
you
brought
up
says
she
guess
i
war
brought
up
at
all
i
growed
up
what
platform
says
he
for
he
was
very
particular
that
all
his
should
go
to
his
meetin
what
church
platform
platform
says
she
with
a
toss
of
her
head
like
a
young
colt
that
got
a
check
of
the
curb
guess
i
war
raised
under
a
platform
at
all
but
in
as
good
a
house
as
grand
as
you
be
said
well
said
the
old
minister
quite
shocked
you
said
you
growed
up
dear
for
you
have
grown
up
in
great
ignorance
i
guess
you
had
better
get
a
lady
that
knows
more
than
me
says
she
flat
i
reckon
i
am
every
bit
and
grain
as
good
as
you
be
if
i
do
understand
a
both
feedin
breedin
and
rearin
then
i
want
to
know
who
does
that
all
church
platform
indeed
says
she
guess
you
were
raised
under
a
glass
frame
in
march
and
transplanted
on
independence
day
war
you
and
off
she
sot
lookin
as
scorney
as
a
london
lady
and
leavin
the
poor
minister
standin
starin
like
a
stuck
pig
well
says
he
up
both
hands
and
turnin
up
the
whites
of
his
eyes
like
a
duck
in
thunder
that
do
bang
the
bush
it
fearly
beats
sheep
shearin
arter
the
blackberry
bushes
have
got
the
wool
it
does
i
vow
them
are
the
tares
them
unitarians
sow
in
our
grain
fields
at
night
i
guess
they
ruinate
the
crops
yet
and
make
the
grounds
so
everlastin
foul
we
have
to
pare
the
sod
and
burn
it
to
kill
the
roots
our
fathers
sowed
the
right
seed
here
in
the
wilderness
and
watered
it
with
their
tears
and
watched
over
it
with
fastin
and
prayer
and
now
it
fairly
run
out
that
a
fact
i
snore
it
got
choked
up
with
all
sorts
of
trash
in
natur
i
declare
dear
dear
i
vow
i
never
seed
the
beat
o
that
in
all
my
born
days
now
the
bluenoses
are
like
that
gal
they
have
grown
up
and
grown
up
in
ignorance
of
many
things
they
had
ought
not
to
know
and
it
as
hard
to
teach
folks
as
it
is
to
break
a
horse
and
they
do
rile
one
temper
so
they
act
so
ugly
that
it
tempts
one
sometimes
to
break
their
confounded
necks
it
near
about
as
much
trouble
as
it
worth
what
remedy
is
there
for
all
this
supineness
said
i
how
can
these
people
be
awakened
out
of
their
ignorant
slothfulness
into
active
exertion
the
remedy
said
slick
is
at
hand
it
is
already
workin
its
own
cure
they
must
recede
before
our
free
and
enlightened
citizens
like
the
indians
our
folks
will
buy
them
out
and
they
must
give
place
to
a
more
intelligent
and
people
they
must
go
to
the
lands
of
labrador
or
be
located
back
of
canada
they
can
hold
on
there
a
few
years
until
the
wave
of
civilization
reaches
them
and
then
they
must
move
again
as
the
savages
do
it
is
decreed
i
hear
the
bugle
of
destiny
of
their
retreat
as
plain
as
anything
congress
will
give
them
a
concession
of
land
if
they
petition
away
to
alleghany
backside
territory
and
grant
them
relief
for
a
few
years
for
we
are
out
of
debt
and
do
know
what
to
do
with
our
surplus
revenue
the
only
way
to
shame
them
that
i
know
would
be
to
sarve
them
as
uncle
enoch
sarved
a
neighbour
of
his
in
varginny
there
was
a
lady
that
had
a
plantation
near
hand
to
and
there
was
only
a
small
river
atwixt
the
two
houses
so
that
folks
could
hear
each
other
talk
across
it
well
she
was
a
dreadful
woman
a
real
catamount
as
savage
as
a
she
bear
that
has
cubs
an
old
farrow
critter
as
ugly
as
sin
and
one
that
both
hooked
and
kicked
too
a
most
particular
onmarciful
a
fact
she
used
to
have
some
of
her
niggers
tied
up
every
day
and
flogged
uncommon
severe
and
their
screams
and
screeches
were
horrid
no
soul
could
stand
it
nothin
was
heerd
all
day
but
lord
missus
oh
lord
missus
enoch
was
fairly
sick
of
the
sound
for
he
was
a
man
and
says
he
to
her
one
day
do
marm
find
out
some
other
place
to
give
your
cattle
the
cowskin
for
it
worries
me
to
hear

on
so
dreadful
bad
i
ca
stand
it
i
vow
they
are
flesh
and
blood
as
well
as
we
be
though
the
meat
is
a
different
colour
but
it
was
no
good
she
jist
up
and
told
him
to
mind
his
own
business
and
she
guessed
she
mind
he
was
determined
to
shame
her
out
of
it
so
one
mornin
after
breakfast
he
goes
into
the
cane
field
and
says
he

of
the
black
overseers

whole
gang
of

of
feeling
for
their
own
people
well
when
they
were
gathered
there
according
to
orders
they
looked
streaked
enough
you
may
depend
thinkin
they
were
going
to
get
it
all
round
and
the
wenches
they
fell
to
their
hands
and
like

on
the
ground
and
rolled
over

over
with
lafter
well
when
they
came
to
the
chorus
lord
missus
if
they
did
let
go
it
a
pity
they
made
the
river
ring
agin
they
were
heerd
clean
out
to
sea
all
the
folks
ran
out
of
the
lady
house
to
see
what
on
airth
was
the
matter
on
uncle
enoch
plantation
they
thought
there
was
actilly
a
rebellion
there
but
when
they
listened
awhile
and
heerd
it
over
and
over
again
they
took
the
hint
and
returned
in
their
sleeves
says
they
enoch
slick
he
upsides
with
missus
this
hitch
anyhow
uncle
never
heerd
anything
more
of
lord
arter
that
yes
they
ought
to
be
shamed
out
of
it
those
bluenoses
when
reason
fails
to
convince
there
is
nothin
left
but
ridicule
if
they
have
no
ambition
apply
to
their
feelings
slap
a
blister
on
their
pride
and
it
will
do
the
business
it
like
ginger
under
a
horse
tail
it
makes
him
carry
up
real
handsum
i
tell
you
when
i
was
a
boy
i
was
always
late
to
school
well
preachin
i
did
mind
much
but
i
never
could
bear
to
hear
mother
say
sam
are
you
actilly
up
for
all
day
well
i
hope
your
airly
risin
wo
hurt
you
i
declare
what
on
airth
is
to
happen
now
well
wonders
will
never
cease
it
raised
my
dander
at
last
says
i
mother
do
say
that
any
more
for
gracious
sake
for
it
makes
me
feel
ugly
and
i
get
up
as
airly
as
any
on
you
and
so
i
did
and
i
soon
found
what
worth
knowin
in
this
life
an
airly
start
makes
easy
stages
no
xiii
the
clockmaker
opinion
of
halifax
the
next
morning
was
warmer
than
several
that
had
preceded
it
it
was
one
of
those
uncommonly
fine
days
that
distinguish
an
american
autumn
i
guess
said
slick
the
heat
today
is
like
a
glass
of
mint
julip
with
a
lump
of
ice
in
it
it
tastes
cool
and
feels
warm
it
real
good
i
tell
you
i
love
such
a
day
as
this
dearly
generally
allowed
the
finest
weather
in
the
world
is
in
america
there
ai
the
beat
of
it
to
be
found
anywhere
he
then
lighted
a
cigar
and
throwing
himself
back
on
his
chair
put
both
feet
out
of
the
window
and
sat
with
his
arms
folded
a
perfect
picture
of
happiness
you
appear
said
i
to
have
travelled
over
the
whole
of
this
province
and
to
have
observed
the
country
and
the
people
with
much
attention
pray
what
is
your
opinion
of
the
present
state
and
future
prospects
of
halifax
if
you
will
tell
me
said
he
when
the
folks
there
will
wake
up
then
i
can
answer
you
but
they
are
fast
asleep
as
to
the
province
it
a
splendid
province
and
calculated
to
go
ahead
it
will
grow
as
fast
as
a
varginny
gal
and
they
grow
so
amazin
fast
if
you
put
your
arm
round
one
of
their
necks
to
kiss
them
by
the
time
done
they
grown
up
into
women
it
a
pretty
province
i
tell
you
good
above
and
better
below
surface
covered
with
pastures
meadows
woods
and
a
sight
of
water
privileges
and
under
the
ground
full
of
mines
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
the
soup
at
the
house
one
day
i
was
in
the
mall
and
who
should
i
meet
but
major
bradford
a
gentleman
from
connecticut
that
traded
in
calves
and
pumpkins
for
the
boston
market
says
he
where
do
you
get
your
grub
today
general
peep
tavern
says
i
fit
for
niggers
says
he
do
you
come
to
the
house
the
most
splendid
thing
it
generally
allowed
in
all
the
world
says
i
a
notch
above
my
mark
i
guess
it
too
plagy
dear
for
me
i
ca
afford
it
no
how
says
he
dear
in
one
sense
but
it
dog
cheap
in
another
it
a
grand
place
for
speculation
there
so
many
rich
southerners
and
strangers
there
that
have
more
money
than
wit
that
you
might
do
a
pretty
good
business
there
without
goin
out
of
the
street
door
i
made
two
hundred
dollars
this
mornin
in
little
less
than
half
no
time
there
a
carolina
lawyer
there
as
rich
as
a
bank
and
says
he
to
me
arter
breakfast
major
says
he
i
wish
i
knew
where
to
get
a
real
slapping
trotter
of
a
horse
one
that
could
trot
with
a
flash
of
lightning
for
a
mile
and
beat
it
by
a
whole
neck
or
so
says
i
my
lord
for
you
must
know
he
says
he
the
nearest
male
heir
to
a
scotch
dormant
peerage
my
lord
says
i
i
have
one
a
proper
sneezer
a
chap
that
can
go
ahead
of
a
railroad
steamer
a
real
natural
traveller
one
that
can
trot
with
the
ball
out
of
the
small
eend
of
a
rifle
and
never
break
into
a
gallop
says
he
major
i
wish
you
would
give
me
that
nickname
i
do
like
it
though
he
looked
as
tickled
all
the
time
as
possible
i
never
knew
says
he
a
lord
that
war
a
fool
that
a
fact
and
that
the
reason
i
do
go
ahead
and
claim
the
title
well
says
i
my
lord
i
do
know
but
somehow
i
ca
help
if
you
have
a
good
claim
you
be
more
like
a
fool
not
to
go
ahead
with
it
well
says
he
lord
or
no
lord
let
look
at
your
horse
so
away
i
went
to
joe
brown
livery
stable
at
eend
of
the
city
and
picked
out
the
best
trotter
he
had
and
no
great
stick
to
brag
on
either
says
i
joe
brown
what
do
you
ax
for
that
horse
two
hundred
dollars
says
he
well
says
i
i
will
take
him
out
and
try
him
and
if
i
like
him
i
will
keep
him
so
i
shows
our
carolina
lord
the
horse
and
when
he
gets
on
him
says
i
do
let
him
trot
as
fast
as
he
can
resarve
that
for
a
heat
if
folks
find
out
how
everlastin
fast
he
is
they
be
afeared
to
stump
you
for
a
start
when
he
returned
he
said
he
liked
the
horse
amazinly
and
axed
the
price
four
hundred
dollars
says
i
you
ca
get
nothin
special
without
a
good
price
pewter
cases
never
hold
good
watches
i
know
it
says
he
the
horse
is
mine
thinks
i
to
myself
that
more
than
ever
i
could
say
of
him
then
anyhow
well
i
was
goin
to
tell
you
about
the
soup
says
the
major
near
about
dinner
time
jist
come
and
see
how
you
like
the
location
there
was
a
sight
of
folks
there
gentlemen
and
ladies
in
the
public
room
i
never
seed
so
many
afore
except
at
commencement
day
all
ready
for
a
start
and
when
the
gong
sounded
off
we
sot
like
a
flock
of
sheep
well
if
there
war
a
jam
you
may
depend
some
one
give
me
a
pull
and
i
near
abouts
went
heels
up
over
head
so
i
reached
out
both
hands
and
caught
hold
of
the
first
thing
i
could
and
what
should
it
be
but
a
lady
dress
well
as
i
alive
rip
went
the
frock
and
tear
goes
the
petticoat
and
when
i
righted
myself
from
my
beam
eends
away
they
all
came
home
to
me
and
there
she
was
the
pretty
critter
with
all
her
upper
riggin
standin
as
far
as
her
waist
and
nothin
left
below
but
a
short
linen
if
she
did
scream
it
a
pity
and
the
more
she
screamed
the
more
folks
larfed
for
no
soul
could
help
larfin
till
one
of
the
waiters
folded
her
up
in
a
tablecloth
an
awkward
devil
you
be
slick
says
the
major
that
comes
of
not
falling
in
first
they
should
have
formed
four
deep
rear
rank
in
open
order
and
marched
in
to
our
splendid
national
air
and
filed
off
to
their
seats
right
and
left
shoulders
forward
i
feel
kinder
sorry
too
says
he
that
young
heifer
but
she
showed
a
proper
pretty
leg
tho
slick
did
she
i
guess
you
often
get
such
a
chance
as
that
well
i
gets
near
the
major
at
table
and
afore
me
stood
a
china
utensil
with
two
handles
full
of
soup
about
the
size
of
a
with
a
large
silver
scoop
in
it
near
about
as
big
as
a
ladle
of
a
maple
sugar
kettle
i
was
jist
about
bailing
out
some
soup
into
my
dish
when
the
major
said
it
up
from
the
bottom
slick
well
sure
enough
i
gives
it
a
drag
from
the
bottom
and
up
come
the
fat
pieces
of
turtle
and
the
thick
rich
soup
and
a
sight
of
little
forced
meat
balls
of
the
size
of
sheep
dung
no
soul
could
tell
how
good
it
was
it
was
near
about
as
handsum
as
father
old
genuine
particular
cider
and
that
you
could
feel
tingle
clean
away
down
to
the
tip
eends
of
your
toes
says
the
major
give
you
slick
a
new
wrinkle
on
your
horn
folks
ai
thought
nothin
of
unless
they
live
at
treemont
it
all
the
go
do
you
dine
at
peep
tavern
every
day
and
then
off
hot
foot
to
treemont
and
pick
your
teeth
on
the
street
steps
there
and
folks
will
think
you
dine
there
i
do
it
often
and
it
saves
two
dollars
a
day
then
he
put
his
finger
on
his
nose
and
says
he
is
the
word
now
this
province
is
jist
like
that
soup
good
enough
at
top
but
dip
down
and
you
have
the
riches
the
coal
the
iron
ore
the
gypsum
and
what
not
as
for
halifax
it
well
enough
in
itself
though
no
great
shakes
neither
a
few
sizeable
houses
with
a
proper
sight
of
small
ones
like
half
a
dozen
old
hens
with
their
broods
of
young
chickens
but
the
people
the
strange
critters
they
are
all
asleep
they
walk
in
their
sleep
and
talk
in
their
sleep
and
what
they
say
one
day
they
forget
the
next
they
say
they
were
dreaming
you
know
where
governor
campbell
lives
do
you
in
a
large
stone
house
with
a
great
wall
round
it
that
looks
like
a
state
prison
well
near
hand
there
is
a
nasty
dirty
buryin
ground
there
it
filled
with
large
grave
rats
as
big
as
kittens
and
the
springs
of
black
water
there
go
through
the
chinks
of
the
rocks
and
flow
into
all
the
wells
and
fairly
pyson
the
folks
it
a
dismal
place
i
tell
you
i
wonder
the
air
from
it
do
turn
all
the
silver
in
the
governor
house
of
a
brass
colour
and
folks
say
he
has
four
cart
loads
of
it
it
so
everlastin
bad
it
near
about
as
nosey
as
a
slave
ship
of
niggers
well
you
may
go
there
and
shake
the
folks
to
all
etarnity
and
you
wo
wake
i
guess
and
yet
there
much
difference
atween
their
sleep
and
the
folks
at
halifax
only
they
lie
still
there
and
are
quiet
and
do
walk
and
talk
in
their
sleep
like
them
above
ground
halifax
reminds
me
of
a
russian
officer
i
once
seed
at
warsaw
he
had
lost
both
arms
in
battle
but
i
guess
i
must
tell
you
first
why
i
went
there
that
will
show
you
how
we
speculate
one
sabbath
day
after
bell
ringin
when
most
of
the
women
had
gone
to
meetin
for
they
were
great
hands
for
pretty
sarmons
and
our
unitarian
ministers
all
preach
poetry
only
they
leave
the
rhyme
out
it
sparkles
like
perry
i
goes
down
to
east
india
wharf
to
see
captain
zeek
hancock
of
nantucket
to
enquire
how
oil
was
and
if
it
it
would
bear
doin
anything
in
when
who
should
come
along
but
jabish
green
says
he
do
you
do
is
this
as
pretty
a
day
as
you
see
between
this
and
norfolk
it
whips
english
weather
by
a
long
chalk
and
then
he
looked
down
at
my
watch
seals
and
looked
and
looked
as
if
he
thought
i
stole
at
last
he
looks
up
and
says
he
i
suppose
you
would
go
to
warsaw
would
you
if
it
was
made
worth
your
while
warsaw
says
i
for
i
believe
in
my
heart
we
have
a
hundred
of
of
at
all
says
he
in
poland
i
do
know
says
i
do
you
call
worth
while
dollars
a
day
expenses
paid
and
a
bonus
of
one
thousand
dollars
if
speculation
turns
out
well
am
off
says
i
you
say
go
says
he
the
hamburg
packet
now
says
he
in
a
tarnation
hurry
goin
today
in
the
custom
house
boat
along
with
josiah
bradford
gals
down
to
nahant
but
i
tell
you
what
i
am
at
the
emperor
of
russia
has
ordered
the
poles
to
cut
off
their
queues
on
the
of
january
you
must
buy
them
all
up
and
ship
them
off
to
london
for
the
wig
makers
human
hair
is
scarce
and
risin
a
massy
says
i
queer
they
will
look
wo
they
well
i
vow
that
what
the
sea
folks
call
sailing
under
bare
poles
come
true
ai
it
guess
it
will
turn
out
a
good
spec
says
he
and
a
good
one
it
did
turn
out
he
cleared
ten
thousand
dollars
by
it
when
i
was
at
warsaw
as
i
was
there
was
a
russian
officer
there
who
had
lost
both
his
arms
in
battle
a
contented
critter
as
i
ever
seed
and
he
was
fed
with
spoons
by
his
neighbours
but
arter
awhile
they
grew
tired
of
it
and
i
guess
he
near
about
starved
to
death
at
last
now
halifax
is
like
that
spooney
as
i
used
to
call
him
it
is
fed
by
the
outports
and
they
begin
to
have
enough
to
do
to
feed
themselves
it
must
larn
to
live
without
they
have
no
river
and
no
country
about
let
them
make
a
railroad
to
minas
basin
and
they
will
have
arms
of
their
own
to
feed
themselves
with
if
they
do
do
it
and
do
it
soon
i
guess
they
get
into
a
decline
that
no
human
skill
will
cure
they
are
proper
thin
now
you
can
count
their
ribs
as
far
as
you
can
see
them
the
only
thing
that
will
either
make
or
save
halifax
is
a
railroad
across
the
country
to
bay
of
fundy
will
do
to
talk
of
says
one
see
it
some
day
says
another
says
a
third
will
come
but
we
are
too
young
yet
our
old
minister
had
a
darter
a
real
gal
as
see
in
a
day
ride
and
she
had
two
or
three
offers
of
marriage
from
men
most
particular
good
specs
but
minister
always
said
you
are
too
young
the
day
will
come
but
you
are
too
young
yet
dear
well
phoebe
did
think
so
at
all
she
said
she
guessed
she
knew
better
nor
that
so
the
next
offer
she
had
she
said
she
had
no
notion
to
lose
another
chance
off
she
shot
to
rhode
island
and
got
married
says
she
too
old
he
do
know
that
jist
the
case
at
halifax
the
old
folks
say
the
country
is
too
young
the
time
will
come
and
so
on
and
in
the
meantime
the
young
folks
wait
and
run
off
to
the
states
where
the
maxim
is
is
the
time
for
improvement
a
new
country
is
never
too
young
for
exertion
push
on
keep
movin
go
ahead
darn
it
all
said
the
clockmaker
rising
with
great
animation
clinching
his
fist
and
extending
his
arm
darn
it
all
it
fairly
makes
my
dander
rise
to
see
the
nasty
idle
critters
they
ai
fit
to
tend
a
i
vow
they
ought
to
be
quilted
round
and
round
a
room
like
a
lady
the
matter
of
two
hours
a
day
to
keep
them
from
dyin
of
apoplexy
hush
hush
said
i
slick
you
forget
well
said
he
resuming
his
usual
composure
well
it
enough
to
make
one
vexed
though
i
declare
is
it
slick
has
often
alluded
to
this
subject
and
always
in
a
most
decided
manner
i
am
inclined
to
think
he
is
right
howe
papers
on
the
railroad
i
read
till
i
came
to
his
calculations
but
i
never
could
read
figures
i
ca
cipher
and
there
i
paused
it
was
a
barrier
i
retreated
a
few
paces
took
a
running
leap
and
cleared
the
whole
of
them
slick
says
he
has
under
and
not
over
rated
its
advantages
he
appears
to
be
such
a
shrewd
observing
intelligent
man
and
so
perfectly
at
home
on
these
subjects
that
i
confess
i
have
more
faith
in
this
humble
but
eccentric
clockmaker
than
in
any
other
man
i
have
met
with
in
this
province
i
therefore
pronounce
there
will
be
a
railroad
no
xiv
sayings
and
doings
in
cumberland
i
reckon
said
the
clockmaker
as
we
strolled
through
amherst
you
have
read
hook
story
of
the
boy
that
one
day
asked
one
of
his
father
guests
who
his
next
door
neighbour
was
and
when
he
heerd
his
name
asked
him
if
he
war
a
fool
my
little
feller
said
he
bea
a
fool
he
is
a
most
particular
sensible
man
but
why
did
you
ax
that
question
said
the
little
boy
said
day
you
were
next
door
to
a
fool
and
i
wanted
to
know
who
lived
next
door
to
you
his
mother
felt
pretty
ugly
i
guess
when
she
heerd
him
run
right
slap
on
that
breaker
now
these
cumberland
folks
have
curious
next
door
neighbours
too
they
are
placed
by
their
location
right
atwixt
fire
and
water
they
have
new
brunswick
politics
on
one
side
and
nova
scotia
politics
on
side
of
them
and
bay
fundy
and
bay
varte
on
two
sides
they
are
actilly
in
hot
water
they
are
up
to
their
cruppers
in
politics
and
great
hands
for
talking
of
house
of
assembly
political
unions
and
what
not
like
all
folks
who
wade
so
deep
they
ca
always
tell
the
natur
of
the
ford
sometimes
they
strike
their
shins
agin
a
snag
of
a
rock
at
other
times
they
go
whap
into
a
quicksand
and
if
they
do
take
special
care
they
are
apt
to
go
souse
over
head
and
ears
into
deep
water
i
guess
if
they
talk
more
of
rotation
and
less
of
elections
more
of
them
dykes
and
less
of
banks
and
attend
more
to
and
less
to
it
be
better
for
now
you
mention
the
subject
i
think
i
have
observed
said
i
that
there
is
a
great
change
in
your
countrymen
in
that
respect
formerly
whenever
you
met
an
american
you
had
a
dish
of
politics
set
before
you
whether
you
had
an
appetite
for
it
or
not
but
lately
i
have
remarked
they
seldom
allude
to
it
pray
to
what
is
this
attributable
i
guess
said
he
they
have
enough
of
it
to
home
and
are
sick
of
the
subject
they
are
cured
the
way
our
pastry
cooks
cure
their
of
stealing
sweet
notions
out
of
their
shops
when
they
get
a
new
they
tell
him
he
must
never
so
much
as
look
at
all
them
nice
things
and
if
he
dares
to
lay
the
weight
of
his
finger
upon
one
on
they
have
him
up
for
it
before
a
justice
they
tell
him
it
every
bit
and
grain
as
bad
as
stealing
from
a
till
well
that
sure
to
set
him
at
it
just
as
a
high
fence
does
a
breachy
ox
first
to
look
over
it
and
then
to
push
it
down
with
its
rump
it
human
natur
well
the
boy
eats
and
eats
till
he
ca
eat
no
longer
and
then
he
gets
sick
at
his
stomach
and
hates
the
very
sight
of
sweetmeats
arterwards
we
had
politics
with
us
till
we
dog
sick
of
i
tell
you
besides
i
guess
we
are
as
far
from
perfection
as
when
we
set
out
for
it
you
may
get
purity
of
election
but
how
are
you
to
get
purity
of
members
it
would
take
a
great
deal
of
ciphering
to
tell
that
i
never
seed
it
yet
and
never
heerd
tell
of
one
who
had
seed
it
the
best
member
i
ever
seed
was
john
adams
well
john
adams
could
no
more
plough
a
straight
furrow
in
politics
than
he
could
haul
the
plough
himself
he
might
set
out
straight
at
for
a
little
way
but
he
was
sure
to
get
crooked
afore
he
got
to
the
eend
of
the
ridge
and
sometimes
he
would
have
two
or
three
crooks
in
it
i
used
to
say
to
him
on
airth
is
it
adams
for
he
was
no
way
proud
like
though
he
was
president
of
our
great
nation
and
it
is
allowed
to
be
the
greatest
nation
in
the
world
too
for
you
might
see
him
sometimes
of
an
arternoon
along
with
the
boys
in
the
potomac
i
do
believe
that
the
way
he
larned
to
give
the
folks
the
dodge
so
spry
well
i
used
to
say
to
him
on
airth
is
it
adams
you
ca
make
straight
work
on
it
he
was
a
grand
hand
at
an
excuse
though
minister
used
to
say
that
folks
that
were
good
at
an
excuse
were
seldom
good
for
nothin
else
sometimes
he
said
the
ground
was
so
tarnation
stony
it
throwed
the
plough
out
at
other
times
he
said
the
off
ox
was
such
an
ugly
critter
there
was
no
doin
nothin
with
him
or
that
there
was
so
much
machinery
about
the
plough
it
made
it
plagy
hard
to
steer
or
maybe
it
was
the
fault
of
them
that
went
afore
him
that
they
laid
it
down
so
bad
unless
he
was
hired
for
another
term
of
four
years
the
work
would
look
well
and
if
all
them
excuses
would
do
why
he
would
take
to
scolding
the
nigger
that
drove
the
team
throw
all
the
blame
on
him
and
order
him
to
have
an
everlastin
with
the
cowskin
you
might
as
well
catch
a
weasel
asleep
as
catch
him
he
had
somethin
the
matter
with
one
eye
well
he
knew
i
that
when
i
was
a
boy
so
one
day
a
feller
presented
a
petition
to
him
and
he
told
him
it
was
very
affectin
says
he
fairly
draws
tears
from
me
and
his
weak
eye
took
to
lettin
off
its
water
like
statiee
so
as
soon
as
the
chap
went
he
winks
to
me
with
one
quite
knowin
as
much
as
to
say
see
it
all
in
my
eye
slick
but
do
let
on
to
any
one
about
it
that
i
said
so
that
eye
was
a
regular
cheat
a
complete
new
england
wooden
nutmeg
folks
said
adams
was
a
very
man
perhaps
he
was
but
i
guess
that
eye
did
pump
its
water
out
o
that
place
members
in
general
ai
to
be
depended
on
i
tell
you
politics
makes
a
man
as
crooked
as
a
pack
does
a
peddler
not
that
they
are
so
awful
heavy
neither
but
it
teaches
a
man
to
stoop
in
the
long
run
arter
all
there
not
that
difference
in
at
least
there
in
congress
one
would
think
for
if
one
on
is
clear
of
one
vice
why
as
like
as
not
he
has
another
fault
just
as
bad
an
honest
farmer
like
one
of
these
cumberland
folks
when
he
goes
to
choose
atwixt
two
that
offers
for
votes
is
jist
like
the
that
little
critter
is
not
content
to
stay
to
home
in
the
water
and
mind
its
business
but
he
must
try
his
hand
at
flyin
and
he
is
no
great
dab
at
flyin
neither
well
the
moment
he
out
of
water
and
takes
to
flyin
the
sea
fowl
are
arter
him
and
let
him
have
it
and
if
he
has
the
good
luck
to
escape
them
and
makes
a
dive
into
the
sea
the
dolphin
as
like
as
not
has
a
dig
at
him
that
knocks
more
wind
out
of
him
than
he
got
while
aping
the
birds
a
plagy
sight
i
guess
the
bluenose
knows
jist
about
as
much
about
politics
as
this
foolish
fish
knows
about
flyin
all
the
critters
in
natur
are
better
in
their
own
element
it
beats
i
tell
you
to
hear
the
bluenoses
when
they
get
together
talk
politics
they
have
got
three
or
four
evil
spirits
like
the
irish
banshees
that
they
say
cause
all
the
mischief
in
the
province
the
council
the
banks
the
house
of
assembly
and
the
lawyers
if
a
man
places
a
higher
valiation
on
himself
than
his
neighbours
do
and
wants
to
be
a
magistrate
before
he
is
fit
to
carry
the
ink
horn
for
one
and
finds
himself
safely
delivered
of
a
mistake
he
says
it
is
all
owing
to
the
council
the
members
are
cunnin
critters
too
they
know
this
feelin
and
when
they
come
home
from
assembly
and
people
ax
are
all
them
fine
things
you
promised
us
they
say
a
had
all
for
you
but
for
that
etarnal
council
they
nullified
all
we
did
the
country
will
come
to
no
good
till
them
chaps
show
their
respect
for
it
by
covering
their
bottoms
with
homespun
if
a
man
is
so
tarnation
lazy
he
wo
work
and
in
course
has
no
money
why
he
says
it
all
owin
to
the
banks
they
wo
discount
there
no
money
they
ruined
the
province
if
there
bea
a
road
made
up
to
every
citizen
door
away
back
to
the
woods
who
as
like
as
not
has
squatted
there
why
he
says
the
house
of
assembly
have
voted
all
the
money
to
pay
great
men
salaries
and
there
nothin
left
for
poor
settlers
and
cross
roads
well
the
lawyers
come
in
for
their
share
of
cake
and
ale
too
if
they
do
catch
it
it
a
pity
there
was
one
jim
munroe
of
onion
county
connecticut
a
desperate
idle
fellow
a
great
hand
at
singin
songs
drivin
about
with
the
gals
and
so
on
well
if
anybody
windows
were
broke
it
was
jim
munroe
if
any
man
horse
lost
a
tail
or
anybody
dog
got
a
kettle
tied
on
to
it
was
jim
munroe
and
if
there
were
any
youngsters
in
want
of
a
father
they
were
sure
to
be
poor
jim
jist
so
it
is
with
the
lawyers
here
they
stand
godfathers
for
every
misfortune
that
happens
in
the
country
when
there
is
a
mad
dog
about
every
dog
that
barks
is
said
to
be
bit
by
the
mad
one
so
he
gets
credit
for
all
the
mischief
that
every
dog
does
for
three
months
to
come
so
every
feller
that
goes
yelpin
home
from
a
court
house
smartin
from
the
law
swears
he
is
bit
by
a
lawyer
now
there
may
be
something
wrong
in
all
these
things
and
it
ca
be
otherwise
in
natur
in
council
banks
house
of
assembly
and
lawyers
but
change
them
all
and
it
an
even
chance
if
you
do
get
worse
ones
in
their
room
it
is
in
politics
as
in
horses
when
a
man
has
a
beast
that
near
about
up
to
the
notch
he
better
not
swap
him
if
he
does
he
sure
to
get
one
not
so
good
as
his
own
my
rule
is
i
rather
keep
a
critter
whose
faults
i
do
know
than
change
him
for
a
beast
whose
faults
i
do
know
no
xv
the
dancing
master
abroad
i
wish
that
black
heifer
in
the
kitchen
would
give
over
singing
that
everlastin
dismal
tune
said
the
clockmaker
it
makes
my
head
ache
you
heerd
a
song
afore
now
said
he
hav
you
till
you
was
fairly
sick
of
it
for
i
have
i
vow
the
last
time
i
was
in
rhode
island
all
the
gals
sing
there
and
it
generally
allowed
there
no
such
singers
anywhere
they
beat
the
a
long
chalk
they
sing
so
high
some
on
they
go
clear
out
o
sometimes
like
a
lark
well
you
heerd
nothin
but
no
we
never
mention
her
well
i
grew
so
plaguy
tired
of
it
i
used
to
say
to
myself
i
sooner
see
it
than
heer
tell
of
it
i
vow
i
wish
to
gracious
you
would
mention
her
for
it
makes
me
feel
ugly
to
hear
that
same
thing
for
ever
and
ever
and
amen
that
way
well
they
got
a
cant
phrase
here
schoolmaster
is
abroad
and
every
feller
tells
you
that
fifty
times
a
day
there
was
a
chap
said
to
me
not
long
ago
at
truro
slick
this
country
is
rapidly
improving
the
schoolmaster
is
abroad
now
and
he
looked
as
knowin
as
though
he
had
found
a
mate
nest
i
should
think
said
i
it
would
be
jist
about
as
well
i
guess
if
he
stay
to
home
and
mind
his
business
for
your
folks
are
so
consoomedly
ignorant
i
reckon
he
abroad
all
his
time
i
hope
when
he
returns
he
be
the
better
of
his
travels
and
more
nor
many
of
our
young
folks
are
who
go
abroad
for
they
import
more
airs
and
nonsense
than
they
dispose
of
one
while
i
tell
you
some
of
the
stock
remains
on
hand
all
the
rest
of
their
lives
there
nothin
i
hate
so
much
as
cant
of
all
kinds
it
a
sure
sign
of
a
tricky
disposition
if
you
see
a
feller
cant
in
religion
clap
your
hand
into
your
pocket
and
lay
right
hold
of
your
puss
or
he
steal
it
as
sure
as
you
alive
and
if
a
man
cant
in
politics
he
sell
you
if
he
gets
a
chance
you
may
depend
law
and
physic
are
jist
the
same
and
every
mite
and
morsel
as
bad
if
a
lawyer
takes
to
cantin
it
like
the
fox
preachin
to
the
geese
he
eat
up
his
whole
congregation
and
if
a
doctor
takes
to
it
he
a
quack
as
sure
as
rates
the
lord
have
massy
on
you
for
he
wo
i
sooner
trust
my
chance
with
a
naked
hook
any
time
than
one
that
half
covered
with
bad
bait
the
fish
will
sometimes
swaller
the
one
without
thinkin
but
they
get
frightened
at
turn
tail
and
off
like
a
shot
now
to
change
the
tune
i
give
the
bluenoses
a
new
phrase
they
have
an
election
most
likely
next
year
and
then
master
will
be
abroad
a
candidate
is
a
most
particular
polite
man
here
and
there
and
hands
all
round
nothin
improves
a
man
manners
like
an
election
master
abroad
then
nothin
gives
the
paces
equal
to
that
it
makes
them
as
squirmy
as
an
eel
they
cross
hands
and
back
agin
set
to
their
partners
and
right
and
left
in
great
style
and
slick
it
off
at
the
eend
with
a
real
complete
bow
and
a
smile
for
all
the
world
as
sweet
as
a
cat
makes
at
a
pan
of
new
milk
then
they
get
as
full
of
compliments
as
a
dog
is
full
of
fleas
enquirin
how
the
old
lady
is
to
home
and
the
little
boy
that
made
such
a
wonderful
smart
answer
they
never
can
forget
it
till
next
time
a
farm
to
the
nines
and
of
him
how
scandalous
the
road
that
leads
to
his
location
has
been
neglected
and
how
much
he
wants
to
find
a
real
complete
hand
that
can
build
a
bridge
over
his
brook
and
axin
him
if
he
ever
built
one
when
he
gets
the
hook
baited
with
the
right
fly
and
the
simple
critter
begins
to
jump
out
of
water
arter
it
all
mouth
and
gills
he
winds
up
the
reel
and
takes
leave
to
himself
you
see
what
to
the
eend
of
my
line
i
guess
i
know
where
to
find
you
when
i
want
you
there
no
sort
of
fishin
requires
so
much
practice
as
this
when
bait
is
scarce
one
worm
must
answer
for
several
fish
a
handful
of
oats
in
a
pan
arter
it
brings
one
horse
up
in
a
pastur
for
the
bridle
serves
for
another
of
it
is
better
than
of
it
it
saves
the
grain
for
another
time
it
a
poor
business
arter
all
is
electioneering
and
when
dancin
master
is
abroad
he
as
apt
to
teach
a
man
to
cut
capers
and
get
larfed
at
as
anything
else
it
ai
every
one
that
soople
enough
to
dance
real
complete
politics
take
a
great
deal
of
time
and
grind
away
a
man
honesty
near
about
as
fast
as
cleaning
a
knife
with
brick
dust
takes
its
steel
out
what
does
a
critter
get
arter
all
for
it
in
this
country
why
nothin
but
expense
and
disappointment
as
king
solomon
says
and
that
man
was
up
to
a
thing
or
two
you
may
depend
though
our
professor
did
say
he
war
so
knowin
as
uncle
sam
it
all
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
i
raised
a
colt
once
half
blood
a
perfect
pictur
of
a
horse
and
a
genuine
clipper
could
gallop
like
the
wind
a
real
daisy
a
perfect
doll
had
an
eye
like
a
weasel
and
nostril
like
commodore
rodgers
speakin
trumpet
well
i
took
it
down
to
the
races
at
new
york
and
father
he
went
along
with
me
for
says
he
you
do
know
everything
i
guess
you
hai
cut
your
wisdom
teeth
yet
and
you
are
goin
among
them
that
had
through
their
gums
this
while
past
well
when
we
gets
to
the
races
father
he
gets
colt
and
puts
him
in
an
old
wagon
with
a
worn
out
dutch
harness
and
breast
band
he
looked
like
old
nick
that
a
fact
then
he
fastened
a
head
martingale
on
and
buckled
it
to
the
girths
atwixt
his
fore
legs
says
i
what
on
airth
are
you
at
i
vow
i
feel
ashamed
to
be
seen
with
such
a
catamaran
as
that
and
colt
looks
like
old
satan
himself
no
soul
would
know
him
guess
i
war
born
yesterday
sam
says
he
me
be
i
know
what
i
am
at
i
guess
i
slip
it
into
afore
i
done
as
slick
as
a
whistle
i
guess
i
can
see
as
far
into
a
millstone
as
the
best
on
well
father
never
entered
the
horse
at
all
but
stood
by
and
seed
the
races
and
the
winnin
horse
was
followed
about
by
the
matter
of
two
or
three
thousand
people
of
him
and
admirin
him
they
seemed
as
if
they
never
had
seed
a
horse
afore
the
owner
of
him
was
all
up
on
eend
of
him
and
the
course
to
produce
a
horse
to
run
agin
him
for
four
hundred
dollars
father
goes
up
to
him
lookin
as
soft
as
dough
and
as
meechin
as
you
please
and
says
he
it
ai
every
one
that
has
four
hundred
dollars
it
a
plaguy
sight
of
money
i
tell
you
would
you
run
for
one
hundred
dollars
and
give
me
a
little
start
if
you
would
try
my
colt
out
of
my
old
wagon
agin
you
i
vow
look
at
your
horse
says
he
so
away
they
went
and
a
proper
sight
of
people
arter
them
to
look
at
colt
and
when
they
seed
him
they
sot
up
such
a
larf
i
felt
ready
to
cry
for
spite
says
i
to
myself
can
possess
the
old
man
to
act
arter
that
fashion
i
do
believe
he
has
taken
leave
of
his
senses
need
larf
says
father
smarter
than
he
looks
our
minister
old
horse
captain
jack
is
reckoned
as
quick
a
beast
of
his
age
as
any
in
our
location
and
that
colt
can
beat
him
for
a
lick
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
quite
easy
i
seed
it
myself
well
they
larfed
agin
louder
than
before
and
says
father
you
dispute
my
word
try
me
what
odds
will
you
give
to
one
says
the
owner
hundred
to
four
hundred
dollars
that
a
great
deal
of
money
ai
it
says
father
i
was
to
lose
it
i
look
pretty
foolish
would
i
how
folks
would
pass
their
jokes
at
me
when
i
went
home
again
you
would
take
that
wagon
and
harness
for
fifty
dollars
of
it
would
you
says
he
says
the
other
than
disappoint
you
as
you
seem
to
have
set
your
mind
on
losing
your
money
i
care
if
i
do
as
soon
as
it
was
settled
father
drives
off
to
the
stables
and
then
returns
mounted
with
a
red
silk
pocket
handkerchief
tied
round
his
head
and
colt
like
himself
as
proud
as
a
nabob
chock
full
of
spring
like
the
wire
eend
of
a
bran
new
pair
of
trouser
galluses
one
said
a
plaguy
nice
lookin
colt
that
old
feller
has
arter
all
horse
will
show
play
for
it
yet
says
a
third
and
i
heard
one
feller
say
guess
that
a
regular
yankee
trick
a
complete
take
in
they
had
a
fair
start
for
it
and
off
they
sot
father
took
the
lead
and
kept
it
and
won
the
race
though
it
was
a
pretty
tight
scratch
for
father
was
too
old
to
ride
colt
he
was
near
about
the
matter
of
seventy
years
old
well
when
the
colt
was
walked
round
after
the
race
there
was
an
amazin
crowd
arter
him
and
several
wanted
to
buy
him
but
says
father
am
i
to
get
home
without
him
and
what
shall
i
do
with
that
wagon
and
harness
so
far
as
i
be
from
slickville
so
he
kept
them
in
talk
till
he
felt
their
pulses
pretty
well
and
at
last
he
closed
with
a
southerner
for
seven
hundred
dollars
and
we
returned
having
made
a
considerable
good
spec
of
colt
says
father
to
me
says
he
seed
the
crowd
the
horse
when
we
came
there
did
you
sir
said
i
did
when
colt
beat
him
no
one
follered
him
at
all
but
come
about
him
that
popularity
said
he
won
soon
lost
cried
up
sky
high
one
minute
and
deserted
the
next
or
run
down
colt
will
share
the
same
fate
he
get
beat
afore
long
and
then
he
done
for
the
multitude
are
always
our
great
washington
found
that
out
and
the
british
officer
that
beat
bonaparte
the
bread
they
gave
him
turned
sour
afore
he
got
half
through
the
loaf
his
soap
had
hardly
stiffened
afore
it
ran
right
back
to
lye
and
grease
agin
was
sarved
the
same
way
i
liked
to
have
missed
my
pension
the
committee
said
i
war
at
bunker
hill
at
all
the
villans
that
was
a
glo
thinks
i
old
boy
if
you
once
get
into
that
field
you
race
longer
than
colt
a
plaguy
sight
you
run
clear
away
to
the
fence
to
the
far
eend
afore
you
stop
so
i
jist
cut
in
and
took
a
hand
myself
says
i
did
father
properly
that
old
wagon
was
a
bright
scheme
it
led
on
till
you
got
on
the
right
spot
did
it
says
father
a
moral
sam
in
everything
in
natur
never
have
nothin
to
do
with
elections
you
see
the
vally
of
popularity
in
the
case
of
that
horse
sarve
the
public
nine
hundred
and
times
and
the
thousandth
if
they
do
agree
with
you
they
desart
and
abuse
you
see
how
they
sarved
old
john
adams
see
how
they
let
jefferson
starve
in
his
old
age
see
how
good
old
munroe
like
to
have
got
right
into
jail
after
his
term
of
president
was
up
they
may
talk
of
independence
says
father
sam
i
tell
you
what
independence
is
and
he
gave
his
hands
a
slap
agin
his
trousers
pocket
and
made
the
gold
eagles
he
won
at
the
race
all
jingle
agin
says
he
giving
them
another
wipe
with
his
fist
and
winkin
as
much
as
to
say
do
you
hear
that
my
boy
i
call
independence
he
was
in
great
spirits
the
old
man
he
was
so
proud
of
winnin
the
race
and
puttin
the
leake
into
the
new
yorkers
he
looked
all
dander
them
great
hungry
bitterns
says
he
only
he
called
them
by
another
name
that
do
sound
quite
pretty
the
outlandish
states
to
congress
talk
about
independence
but
sam
said
he
hitting
the
shiners
agin
till
he
made
them
dance
right
up
an
eend
in
his
pocket
like
to
feel
it
sam
said
he
the
pocket
well
first
make
that
independent
and
then
the
spirit
will
be
like
a
horse
turned
out
to
grass
in
the
spring
for
the
first
time
he
all
head
and
tail
and
kickin
and
racin
and
carryin
on
like
mad
it
soon
gets
independent
too
while
it
in
the
stall
it
may
hold
up
and
paw
and
whinny
and
feel
as
spry
as
anything
but
the
leather
strap
keeps
it
to
the
manger
and
the
lead
weight
to
the
eend
of
it
makes
it
hold
down
its
head
at
last
no
says
he
independence
and
he
gave
the
eagles
such
a
drive
with
his
fist
he
bust
his
pocket
and
sent
a
whole
raft
of
them
down
his
leg
to
the
ground
says
i
and
i
swear
i
could
hardly
keep
from
larfin
he
looked
so
peskily
vexed
says
i
guess
there
a
moral
in
that
too
extremes
nary
way
are
none
o
the
best
well
says
he
kinder
snappishly
suppose
you
half
right
sam
but
we
said
enough
about
it
let
drop
the
subject
and
see
if
i
have
picked
all
up
for
my
eyes
are
none
of
the
best
now
near
hand
to
seventy
no
xvi
slick
opinion
of
the
british
what
success
had
you
said
i
in
the
sale
of
your
clocks
among
the
scotch
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
province
do
you
find
them
as
gullible
as
the
bluenoses
well
said
he
you
have
heerd
tell
that
a
yankee
never
answers
one
question
without
axing
another
have
you
did
you
ever
see
an
english
make
a
bow
because
if
you
hai
observed
it
i
have
and
a
queer
one
it
is
i
swan
he
brings
his
right
arm
up
jist
across
his
face
and
passes
on
with
a
knowin
nod
of
his
head
as
much
as
to
say
how
do
you
do
but
keep
clear
o
my
wheels
or
fetch
your
horses
a
lick
in
the
mouth
as
sure
as
you
born
jist
as
a
bear
puts
up
his
paw
to
fend
off
the
blow
of
a
stick
from
his
nose
well
that
the
way
i
pass
them
scotchmen
lord
if
they
were
located
down
in
these
here
cumberland
marshes
how
the
mosquitoes
would
tickle
them
up
would
they
they
set
scratching
thereabouts
as
an
irishman
does
his
head
when
he
in
sarch
of
a
lie
them
fellers
cut
their
afore
they
ever
sot
foot
in
this
country
i
expect
when
they
get
a
bawbee
they
know
what
to
do
with
it
that
a
fact
they
open
their
pouch
and
drop
it
in
and
it
got
a
spring
like
a
it
holds
fast
to
all
it
gets
like
grim
death
to
a
dead
nigger
they
are
proper
skinflints
you
may
depend
oatmeal
is
no
great
shakes
at
best
it
ai
even
as
good
for
a
horse
as
real
yeller
varginny
corn
but
i
guess
i
long
in
finding
out
that
the
grits
hardly
pay
for
the
riddlin
no
a
yankee
has
as
little
chance
among
them
as
a
jew
has
in
new
england
the
sooner
he
clears
out
the
better
you
can
no
more
put
a
leake
into
them
than
you
can
send
a
chisel
into
teake
wood
it
turns
the
edge
of
the
tool
the
first
drive
if
the
bluenoses
knew
the
value
of
money
as
well
as
they
do
they
have
more
cash
and
fewer
clocks
and
tin
reflectors
i
reckon
now
it
different
with
the
irish
they
never
carry
a
puss
for
they
never
have
a
cent
to
put
in
it
they
are
always
in
love
or
in
liquor
or
else
in
a
row
they
are
the
merriest
shavers
i
ever
seed
judge
beler
i
dare
say
you
have
heerd
tell
of
him
he
a
funny
feller
he
put
a
notice
over
his
factory
gate
at
lowell
cigars
or
irishmen
admitted
within
these
walls
for
said
he
one
will
set
a
flame
among
my
cottons
and
among
my
gals
i
wo
have
no
such
inflammable
and
dangerous
things
about
me
on
no
account
when
the
british
wanted
our
folks
to
join
in
the
treaty
to
chock
the
wheels
of
the
slave
trade
i
recollect
hearin
old
john
adams
say
we
had
ought
to
humour
them
for
says
he
supply
us
with
labour
on
easier
terms
by
shippin
out
the
irish
says
he
work
better
and
they
work
cheaper
and
they
do
live
so
long
the
blacks
when
they
are
past
work
hang
on
for
ever
and
a
proper
bill
of
expence
they
be
but
hot
weather
and
new
rum
rub
out
the
poor
rates
for
ones
the
english
are
the
boys
for
tradin
with
they
shell
out
their
cash
like
a
sheef
of
wheat
in
frosty
weather
it
flies
all
over
the
thrashin
floor
but
then
they
are
a
ungainly
breed
of
cattle
as
i
ever
seed
whoever
gave
them
the
name
of
john
bull
knew
what
he
was
about
i
tell
you
for
they
are
folks
i
vow
sulky
ugly
tempered
vicious
critters
and
the
whole
time
and
plaguy
onsafe
unless
well
watched
they
are
as
headstrong
as
mules
and
as
conceited
as
peacocks
the
astonishment
with
which
i
heard
this
tirade
against
my
countrymen
absorbed
every
feeling
of
resentment
i
listened
with
amazement
at
the
perfect
composure
with
which
he
uttered
it
he
treated
it
as
one
of
those
truths
that
need
neither
proof
nor
apology
but
as
a
thing
well
known
and
admitted
by
all
mankind
there
no
richer
sight
that
i
know
of
said
he
than
to
see
one
on
when
he
first
lands
in
one
of
our
great
cities
he
swells
out
as
big
as
a
balloon
his
skin
is
ready
to
burst
with
wind
a
regular
walking
bag
of
gas
and
he
prances
over
the
pavement
like
a
bear
over
hot
iron
a
great
awkward
hulk
of
a
feller
for
they
ai
to
be
compared
to
the
french
in
manners
at
you
as
much
as
to
say
here
jonathan
here
an
englishman
here
a
boy
got
blood
as
pure
as
a
norman
pirate
and
lots
of
the
blunt
of
both
kinds
a
pocket
full
of
one
and
a
mouthfull
of
bea
he
lovely
and
then
he
looks
as
fierce
as
a
tiger
as
much
as
to
say
boo
to
a
goose
if
you
dare
no
i
believe
we
may
stump
the
univarse
we
improve
on
everything
and
we
have
improved
on
our
own
species
you
search
one
while
i
tell
you
afore
you
find
a
man
that
take
him
by
and
large
is
equal
to
one
of
our
free
and
enlightened
citizens
he
the
chap
that
has
both
speed
wind
and
bottom
he
clear
grit
ginger
to
the
backbone
you
may
depend
it
generally
allowed
there
ai
the
beat
of
them
to
be
found
anywhere
spry
as
a
fox
supple
as
an
eel
and
cute
as
a
weasel
though
i
say
it
that
should
say
it
they
fairly
take
the
shine
off
creation
they
are
actilly
equal
to
cash
he
looked
like
a
man
who
felt
that
he
had
expressed
himself
so
aptly
and
so
well
that
anything
additional
would
only
weaken
its
effect
he
therefore
changed
the
conversation
immediately
by
pointing
to
a
tree
at
some
little
distance
from
the
house
and
remarking
that
it
was
the
rock
maple
or
sugar
tree
it
a
pretty
tree
said
he
and
a
profitable
one
too
to
raise
it
will
bear
tapping
for
many
years
tho
it
gets
exhausted
at
last
this
province
is
like
that
tree
it
is
tapped
till
it
begins
to
die
at
the
top
and
if
they
do
drive
in
a
spile
and
stop
the
everlastin
flow
of
the
sap
it
will
perish
altogether
all
the
money
that
made
here
all
the
interest
that
paid
in
it
and
a
pretty
considerable
portion
of
rent
too
all
goes
abroad
for
investment
and
the
rest
is
sent
to
us
to
buy
bread
it
drained
like
a
bog
it
has
opened
and
covered
trenches
all
through
it
and
then
there
others
to
the
foot
of
the
upland
to
cut
off
the
springs
now
you
may
make
even
a
bog
too
dry
you
may
take
the
moisture
out
of
it
to
that
degree
that
the
very
sile
becomes
dust
and
blows
away
the
english
funds
and
our
banks
railroads
and
canals
are
all
absorbing
your
capital
like
a
sponge
and
will
lick
it
up
as
fast
as
you
can
make
it
that
very
bridge
we
heerd
of
at
windsor
is
owned
in
new
brunswick
and
will
pay
toll
to
that
province
the
capitalists
of
nova
scotia
treat
it
like
a
hired
house
they
wo
keep
it
in
repair
they
neither
paint
it
to
preserve
the
boards
nor
stop
a
leak
to
keep
the
frame
from
rottin
but
let
it
go
to
wrack
sooner
than
drive
a
nail
or
put
in
a
pane
of
glass
will
sarve
our
turn
out
they
say
there
neither
spirit
enterprise
nor
patriotism
here
but
the
whole
country
is
as
inactive
as
a
bear
in
winter
that
does
but
scroutch
up
in
his
den
to
himself
if
i
an
unfortunate
devil
it
a
pity
i
have
a
most
splendid
warm
coat
as
a
gentleman
in
these
here
woods
let
him
be
who
he
will
but
i
got
no
socks
to
my
feet
and
i
have
to
sit
for
everlastingly
of
my
paws
to
keep
warm
if
it
war
for
that
i
guess
i
make
some
o
them
chaps
that
have
hoofs
to
their
feet
and
horns
to
their
heads
look
about
them
pretty
sharp
i
know
dismal
now
ai
it
if
i
had
the
framin
of
the
governor
message
if
i
would
show
how
to
put
timber
together
you
may
depend
make
scratch
their
heads
and
stare
i
know
i
went
down
to
matanzas
in
the
fulton
steamboat
once
well
it
was
the
first
of
the
kind
they
ever
seed
and
proper
scared
they
were
to
see
a
vessel
without
sails
or
oars
goin
right
straight
ahead
nine
knots
an
hour
in
the
very
wind
eye
and
a
great
streak
of
smoke
arter
her
as
long
as
the
tail
of
a
comet
i
believe
they
thought
it
was
old
nick
alive
himself
to
a
swim
you
could
see
the
niggers
it
away
from
the
shore
for
dear
life
and
the
soldiers
about
as
if
they
thought
that
we
were
to
take
the
whole
country
presently
a
little
lookin
spanish
officer
all
dressed
off
in
his
livery
as
fine
as
a
fiddle
came
off
with
two
men
in
a
boat
to
board
us
well
we
yawed
once
or
twice
and
motioned
to
him
to
keep
off
for
fear
he
should
get
hurt
but
he
came
right
on
afore
the
wheel
and
i
hope
i
may
be
shot
if
the
paddle
did
strike
the
bow
of
the
boat
with
that
force
it
knocked
up
the
starn
like
a
plank
tilt
when
one
of
the
boys
playin
on
it
is
heavier
than
and
chucked
him
right
atop
of
the
you
never
seed
a
feller
in
such
a
dunderment
in
your
life
he
had
picked
up
a
little
english
from
seein
our
folks
there
so
much
and
when
he
got
up
the
first
thing
he
said
was
all
sheenery
i
say
where
my
boat
and
he
looked
round
as
if
he
thought
it
had
jumped
on
board
too
boat
said
the
captain
why
i
expect
it
gone
to
the
bottom
and
your
men
have
gone
down
to
look
arter
it
for
we
never
seed
or
heerd
tell
of
one
or
of
them
arter
the
boat
was
struck
yes
make
stare
like
that
spanish
officer
as
if
they
had
seed
out
of
their
eyes
for
the
first
time
governor
campbell
did
expect
to
see
such
a
country
as
this
when
he
came
here
i
reckon
i
know
he
did
when
i
was
a
little
boy
about
knee
high
or
so
and
lived
down
connecticut
river
mother
used
to
say
if
you
do
give
over
acting
so
like
old
scratch
i
send
you
off
to
nova
scotia
as
sure
as
you
are
born
i
will
i
vow
well
lord
how
that
used
to
frighten
me
it
made
my
hair
stand
right
up
an
eend
like
a
back
when
she
is
wrathy
it
made
me
drop
it
as
quick
as
wink
like
a
tin
night
cap
put
on
a
dipped
candle
to
bed
it
put
the
fun
right
out
neighbour
dearborne
darter
married
a
gentleman
to
yarmouth
that
speculates
in
the
smugglin
line
well
when
she
went
on
board
to
sail
down
to
nova
scotia
all
her
folks
took
on
as
if
it
was
a
funeral
they
said
she
was
goin
to
be
buried
alive
like
the
nuns
in
portengale
that
get
break
out
of
the
pastur
and
race
off
and
get
catched
and
brought
back
agin
says
the
old
colonel
her
father
my
dear
i
would
sooner
foller
you
to
your
grave
for
that
would
be
an
eend
to
your
troubles
than
to
see
you
go
off
to
that
dismal
country
that
nothin
but
an
iceberg
aground
and
he
howled
as
loud
as
an
irishman
that
tries
to
wake
his
wife
when
she
is
dead
awful
accounts
we
have
of
the
country
a
fact
but
if
the
province
is
not
so
bad
as
they
make
it
out
the
folks
are
a
thousand
times
worse
you
seen
a
flock
of
partridges
of
a
frosty
mornin
in
the
fall
out
of
the
shade
to
a
sunny
spot
and
huddlin
up
there
in
the
warmth
well
the
bluenoses
have
nothin
else
to
do
half
the
time
but
sun
themselves
whose
fault
is
that
why
it
the
fault
of
the
legislature
they
do
encourage
internal
improvement
nor
the
investment
of
capital
in
the
country
and
the
result
is
apathy
inaction
and
poverty
they
spend
three
months
in
halifax
and
what
do
they
do
father
gave
me
a
dollar
once
to
go
to
the
fair
at
hartford
and
when
i
came
back
says
he
what
have
you
got
to
show
for
it
now
i
ax
what
have
they
to
show
for
their
three
months
setting
they
mislead
folks
they
make
believe
all
the
use
of
the
assembly
is
to
bark
at
councillors
judges
bankers
and
such
cattle
to
keep
from
eatin
up
the
crops
and
it
actilly
costs
more
to
feed
them
when
they
are
watchin
than
all
the
others
could
eat
if
they
did
break
a
fence
and
get
in
indeed
some
folks
say
they
are
the
most
breachy
of
the
two
and
ought
to
go
to
pound
themselves
if
their
fences
are
good
them
hungry
cattle
could
break
through
and
if
they
ai
they
ought
to
stake
up
and
with
them
well
but
no
use
to
make
fences
unless
the
land
is
cultivated
if
i
see
a
farm
all
gone
to
wrack
i
say
here
bad
husbandry
and
bad
management
and
if
i
see
a
province
like
this
of
great
capacity
and
great
natural
resources
i
say
there
bad
legislation
no
said
he
with
an
air
of
more
seriousness
than
i
had
yet
observed
how
much
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
laying
aside
personal
attacks
and
petty
jealousies
they
would
not
unite
as
one
man
and
with
one
mind
and
one
heart
apply
themselves
sedulously
to
the
internal
improvement
and
developement
of
this
beautiful
province
its
value
is
utterly
unknown
either
to
the
general
or
local
government
and
the
only
persons
who
duly
appreciate
it
are
the
yankees
no
xvii
a
yankee
handle
for
a
halifax
blade
i
met
a
man
this
mornin
said
the
clockmaker
from
halifax
a
real
conceited
lookin
critter
as
you
ever
seed
all
shines
and
didoes
he
looked
as
if
he
had
picked
up
his
airs
arter
some
officer
of
the
regilars
had
worn
out
and
cast
off
they
sot
on
him
like
clothes
as
if
they
had
been
made
for
him
and
did
exactly
fit
he
looked
fine
but
awkward
like
a
captain
of
militia
when
he
gets
his
uniform
on
to
play
sodger
himself
mighty
handsum
and
that
all
the
world
is
at
him
he
marched
up
and
down
afore
the
street
door
like
a
peacock
as
large
as
life
and
twice
as
natural
he
had
a
riding
whip
in
his
hand
and
every
now
and
then
struck
it
agin
his
thigh
as
much
as
to
say
that
a
splendid
leg
for
a
boot
now
wo
i
astonish
the
amherst
folks
that
all
thinks
i
are
a
pretty
blade
you
i
like
to
fit
a
yankee
handle
on
to
you
that
a
fact
when
i
came
up
he
held
up
his
head
near
about
as
high
as
a
shot
factory
and
stood
with
his
fists
on
his
hips
and
eyed
me
from
head
to
foot
as
a
shakin
quaker
does
a
town
lady
as
much
as
to
say
a
queer
critter
you
be
that
toggery
i
never
seed
afore
you
some
maiden
that
sartain
says
he
to
me
with
the
air
of
a
man
that
chucks
a
cent
into
a
beggar
hat
fine
day
this
sir
you
actilly
think
so
said
i
and
i
gave
it
the
real
connecticut
drawl
said
he
quite
short
i
did
think
so
i
would
say
so
says
i
do
know
but
if
i
did
think
so
i
guess
i
would
say
so
not
says
he
i
expect
says
i
fool
could
see
that
as
well
as
me
and
then
i
stared
at
him
as
much
as
to
say
if
you
like
that
swap
i
am
ready
to
trade
with
you
agin
as
soon
as
you
like
well
he
turned
right
round
on
his
heel
and
walked
off
yankee
doodle
to
himself
he
looked
jist
like
a
man
that
finds
whistlin
a
plaguy
sight
easier
than
thinkin
presently
i
heard
him
ax
the
groom
who
that
yankee
feller
was
said
the
groom
i
guess
it
mr
slick
said
he
you
talk
what
slick
the
clockmaker
why
it
ai
possible
i
wish
i
had
a
known
that
afore
i
declare
for
i
have
a
great
curiosity
to
see
him
folks
say
he
is
an
clever
feller
that
and
he
turned
and
stared
as
if
it
was
old
hickory
himself
then
he
walked
round
and
about
like
a
pig
round
the
fence
of
a
potato
field
for
a
chance
to
cut
in
so
thinks
i
i
jist
give
him
something
to
talk
about
when
he
gets
back
to
the
city
i
fix
a
yankee
handle
on
to
him
in
no
time
times
to
halifax
sir
said
i
says
he
better
business
is
done
on
a
surer
bottom
than
it
was
and
things
look
bright
agin
does
a
candle
says
i
afore
it
goes
out
it
burns
up
ever
so
high
and
then
sinks
right
down
and
leaves
nothin
behind
but
grease
and
an
everlastin
bad
smell
i
guess
they
do
know
how
to
feed
their
lamp
and
it
ca
burn
long
on
nothin
no
sir
the
jig
is
up
with
halifax
and
it
all
their
own
fault
if
a
man
sits
at
his
door
and
sees
stray
cattle
in
his
field
up
of
his
crop
and
his
neighbours
off
his
grain
and
so
much
as
go
and
drive
out
why
i
should
say
it
sarves
him
right
i
do
exactly
understand
sir
said
he
thinks
i
it
would
be
strange
if
you
did
for
i
never
see
one
of
your
folks
yet
that
could
understand
a
hawk
from
a
handsaw
says
i
will
tell
you
what
i
mean
draw
a
line
from
cape
sable
to
cape
cansoo
right
through
the
province
and
it
will
split
it
into
two
this
way
and
i
cut
an
apple
into
two
halves
says
i
worst
half
like
the
rotten
half
of
the
apple
belongs
to
halifax
and
the
other
and
sound
half
belongs
to
john
your
side
of
the
province
on
the
sea
coast
is
all
stone
i
never
seed
such
a
proper
sight
of
rocks
in
my
life
it
enough
to
starve
a
rabbit
well
side
on
the
bay
of
fundy
is
a
superfine
country
there
ai
the
beat
of
it
to
be
found
anywhere
now
would
the
folks
living
away
up
to
the
bay
be
pretty
fools
to
go
to
halifax
when
they
can
go
to
john
with
half
the
trouble
john
is
the
natural
capital
of
the
bay
of
fundy
it
will
be
the
largest
city
in
america
next
to
new
york
it
has
an
immense
back
country
as
big
as
great
britain
a
first
chop
river
and
amazin
sharp
folks
most
as
cute
as
the
yankees
it
a
splendid
location
for
business
well
they
draw
all
the
produce
of
the
bay
shores
and
where
the
produce
goes
the
supplies
return
they
will
take
the
whole
trade
of
the
province
i
guess
your
rich
folks
will
find
they
burnt
their
fingers
they
put
their
foot
in
it
a
fact
houses
without
tenants
wharves
without
shipping
a
town
without
people
what
a
grand
investment
if
you
have
any
loose
dollars
let
out
on
mortgage
in
halifax
that
a
security
keep
clear
of
the
country
for
your
life
the
people
may
run
but
the
town
ca
no
take
away
the
troops
and
you
done
you
sing
the
dead
march
folks
did
at
louisburg
and
shelburne
why
you
hai
got
a
single
thing
worth
havin
but
a
good
harbour
and
as
for
that
the
coast
is
full
of
you
hav
a
pine
log
a
spruce
board
or
a
refuse
shingle
you
neither
raise
wheat
oats
or
hay
nor
never
can
you
have
no
staples
on
airth
unless
it
be
them
iron
ones
for
the
padlocks
in
bridewell
you
sowed
pride
and
reaped
poverty
take
care
of
your
crop
for
it
worth
harvestin
you
have
no
river
and
no
country
what
in
the
name
of
fortin
have
you
to
trade
on
said
he
and
he
showed
the
whites
of
his
eyes
like
a
horse
said
he
slick
how
is
it
then
halifax
ever
grew
at
all
has
it
got
what
it
always
had
it
no
worse
than
it
was
guess
said
i
pole
ai
strong
enough
to
bear
you
neither
if
you
trust
to
that
you
be
into
the
brook
as
sure
as
you
are
born
you
once
had
the
trade
of
the
whole
province
but
john
has
run
off
with
that
now
you
lost
all
but
your
trade
in
blueberries
and
rabbits
with
the
niggers
at
hammond
plains
you
lost
your
customers
your
rivals
have
a
better
stand
for
business
they
got
the
corner
store
four
great
streets
meet
there
and
it
near
the
market
slip
well
he
stared
says
he
believe
you
right
but
i
never
thought
of
that
afore
thinks
i
nobody
ever
suspect
you
of
the
trick
of
thinkin
that
ever
i
heerd
tell
of
of
our
great
men
said
he
it
all
to
your
folks
selling
so
many
clocks
and
polyglot
bibles
they
say
you
have
taken
off
a
horrid
sight
of
money
they
indeed
said
i
i
guess
it
ai
pins
and
needles
that
the
expense
of
it
is
something
more
costly
than
that
some
folks
say
it
the
banks
says
he
still
says
i
you
hearn
tell
too
that
greasin
the
axle
makes
a
gig
harder
to
draw
for
there
jist
about
as
much
sense
in
that
then
says
he
say
smugglin
has
made
us
so
poor
guess
said
i
most
as
good
as
one
whoever
found
out
that
secret
ought
to
get
a
patent
for
it
for
it
worth
knowin
then
the
country
has
grown
poorer
has
it
because
it
has
bought
cheaper
this
year
than
it
did
the
year
before
why
your
folks
are
cute
chaps
i
vow
puzzle
a
philadelphia
lawyer
they
are
so
amazin
knowin
said
he
and
he
rubb
his
hands
and
smiled
like
a
young
doctor
when
he
gets
his
first
patient
said
he
the
timber
duties
are
altered
down
comes
john
body
and
breeches
it
built
on
a
poor
foundation
it
all
show
they
are
speculatin
like
mad
they
ruin
themselves
says
i
you
wait
till
they
dead
for
your
fortin
it
will
be
one
while
i
tell
you
afore
you
pocket
the
shiners
it
no
joke
waitin
for
a
dead
man
shoes
suppose
an
old
feller
of
eighty
was
to
say
when
that
young
feller
dies
to
inherit
his
property
what
would
you
think
why
i
guess
think
he
was
an
old
fool
no
sir
if
the
english
do
want
their
timber
we
do
want
it
all
we
have
used
up
we
hai
got
a
stick
even
to
whittle
if
the
british
do
offer
we
will
and
john
like
a
dear
little
weepin
widow
will
dry
up
her
tears
and
take
to
frolickin
agin
and
accept
it
right
off
is
at
this
moment
such
a
location
hardly
in
america
as
john
for
beside
all
its
other
advantages
it
has
this
great
one
its
only
rival
halifax
has
got
a
dose
of
opium
that
will
send
it
snoring
out
of
the
world
like
a
feller
who
falls
asleep
on
the
ice
of
a
winter
night
it
has
been
asleep
so
long
i
actilly
think
it
never
will
wake
it
an
easy
death
too
you
may
rouse
them
up
if
you
like
but
i
vow
i
wo
i
once
brought
a
feller
to
that
was
drowned
and
one
night
he
got
drunk
and
quilted
me
i
could
walk
for
a
week
says
i
you
the
last
chap
i
ever
save
from
drowning
in
all
my
born
days
if
that
all
the
thanks
i
get
for
it
no
sir
halifax
has
lost
the
run
of
its
custom
who
does
yarmouth
trade
with
john
who
does
annapolis
county
trade
with
john
who
do
all
the
folks
on
the
basin
of
mines
and
bay
shore
trade
with
john
who
does
cumberland
trade
with
john
well
pictou
lunenburg
and
liverpool
supply
themselves
and
the
rest
that
ai
worth
havin
trade
with
halifax
they
take
down
a
few
pigs
old
viteran
geese
and
long
legged
fowls
some
ram
mutton
and
tough
beef
and
swap
them
for
tea
sugar
and
such
little
notions
for
their
old
women
to
home
while
the
railroads
and
canals
of
john
are
to
cut
off
your
gulf
shore
trade
to
miramichi
and
along
there
flies
live
in
the
summer
and
die
in
winter
you
jist
as
noisy
in
war
as
those
little
critters
but
you
sing
small
in
peace
you
done
for
you
are
up
a
tree
you
may
depend
pride
must
fall
your
town
is
like
a
ballroom
arter
a
dance
the
folks
there
eat
drank
and
frolicked
and
left
an
empty
house
the
lamps
and
hangings
are
left
but
the
people
are
gone
there
no
remedy
for
this
said
he
and
he
looked
as
wild
as
a
cherokee
indian
thinks
i
the
handle
is
fitted
on
proper
tight
now
says
i
a
man
has
a
cold
he
had
ought
to
look
out
pretty
sharp
afore
it
gets
seated
on
his
lungs
if
he
do
he
gets
into
a
gallopin
consumption
and
it
gone
goose
with
him
there
is
a
remedy
if
applied
in
time
make
a
railroad
to
the
minas
basin
and
you
have
a
way
for
your
customers
to
get
to
you
and
a
conveyance
for
your
goods
to
them
when
i
was
in
new
york
last
a
cousin
of
mine
hezekiah
slick
said
to
me
i
do
believe
sam
i
shall
be
ruined
i
lost
all
my
custom
they
are
widening
and
improving
the
streets
and
there
so
many
carts
and
people
to
work
in
it
folks
ca
come
to
my
shop
to
trade
what
on
airth
shall
i
do
and
i
payin
a
dreadful
high
rent
too
stop
ki
says
i
when
the
street
is
all
finished
off
and
slicked
up
they
all
come
back
agin
and
a
whole
raft
more
on
too
you
sell
twice
as
much
as
ever
you
did
you
put
off
a
proper
swad
of
goods
next
year
you
may
depend
and
so
he
did
he
made
money
hand
over
hand
a
railroad
will
bring
back
your
customers
if
done
right
off
but
wait
till
trade
has
made
new
channels
and
fairly
gets
settled
in
them
and
you
never
divart
it
agin
to
all
etarnity
when
a
feller
waits
till
a
gal
gets
married
i
guess
it
will
be
too
late
to
pop
the
question
then
john
must
go
ahead
at
any
rate
you
may
if
you
choose
but
you
must
exert
yourselves
i
tell
you
if
a
man
has
only
one
leg
and
wants
to
walk
he
must
get
an
artificial
one
if
you
have
no
river
make
a
railroad
and
that
will
supply
its
place
says
he
slick
people
say
it
never
will
pay
in
the
world
they
say
it
as
mad
a
scheme
as
the
canal
they
indeed
says
i
them
to
me
then
and
i
fit
the
handle
on
to
them
in
tu
tu
i
say
it
will
pay
and
the
best
proof
is
our
folks
will
take
tu
thirds
of
the
stock
did
you
ever
hear
any
one
else
but
your
folks
ax
whether
a
dose
of
medicine
would
pay
when
it
was
given
to
save
life
if
that
everlastin
long
erie
canal
can
secure
to
new
york
the
supply
of
that
far
off
country
most
side
of
creation
surely
a
railroad
of
miles
can
give
you
the
trade
of
the
bay
of
fundy
a
railroad
will
go
from
halifax
to
windsor
and
make
them
one
town
easier
to
send
goods
from
one
to
than
from
governor
campbell
house
to
admiral
cockburn
a
bridge
makes
a
town
a
river
makes
a
town
a
canal
makes
a
town
but
a
railroad
is
bridge
river
thoroughfare
canal
all
in
one
what
a
whappin
large
place
that
would
make
would
it
it
would
be
the
dandy
a
fact
no
when
you
go
back
take
a
piece
of
chalk
and
the
first
dark
night
write
on
every
door
in
halifax
in
large
letters
a
railroad
and
if
they
do
know
the
meanin
of
it
says
you
it
a
yankee
word
if
you
go
to
sam
slick
the
clockmaker
the
chap
that
fixed
a
yankee
handle
on
to
a
halifax
blade
and
i
made
him
a
scrape
of
my
leg
as
much
as
to
say
that
you
every
man
that
buys
a
clock
shall
hear
all
about
a
railroad
no
xviii
the
grahamite
and
the
irish
pilot
i
think
said
i
this
is
a
happy
country
slick
the
people
are
fortunately
all
of
one
origin
there
are
no
national
jealousies
to
divide
and
no
very
violent
politics
to
agitate
them
they
appear
to
be
cheerful
and
contented
and
are
a
civil
hospitable
race
considering
the
unsettled
state
of
almost
every
part
of
the
world
i
think
i
would
as
soon
cast
my
lot
in
nova
scotia
as
in
any
part
i
know
of
it
a
clever
country
you
may
depend
said
he
a
very
clever
country
full
of
mineral
wealth
aboundin
in
superior
water
privileges
and
noble
harbours
a
large
part
of
it
prime
land
and
it
is
in
the
very
heart
of
the
fisheries
but
the
folks
put
me
in
mind
of
a
sect
in
our
country
they
call
the
grahamites
they
eat
no
meat
and
no
exciting
food
and
drink
nothin
stronger
than
water
they
call
it
philosophy
and
that
is
such
a
pretty
word
it
has
made
fools
of
more
folks
than
them
afore
now
but
i
call
it
tarnation
nonsense
i
once
travelled
all
through
the
state
of
maine
with
one
of
them
chaps
he
was
as
thin
as
a
whippin
post
his
skin
looked
like
a
blown
bladder
arter
some
of
the
air
had
leaked
out
kinder
wrinkled
and
rumpled
like
and
his
eye
as
dim
as
a
lamp
that
livin
on
a
short
allowance
of
ile
he
put
me
in
mind
of
a
pair
of
kitchen
tongs
all
legs
shaft
and
head
and
no
belly
a
real
critter
as
holler
as
a
bamboo
walkin
cane
and
twice
as
yaller
he
actilly
looked
as
if
he
had
been
picked
off
a
rack
at
sea
and
dragged
through
a
gimlet
hole
he
was
a
lawyer
thinks
i
the
lord
a
massy
on
your
clients
you
hungry
lookin
critter
you
you
eat
up
alive
as
sure
as
the
lord
made
moses
you
are
jist
the
chap
to
strain
at
a
goat
and
swallow
a
camel
tank
shank
and
flank
all
at
a
gulp
well
when
we
came
to
an
inn
and
a
beef
steak
was
sot
afore
us
for
dinner
he
say
that
is
too
good
for
me
it
too
exciting
all
fat
meat
is
diseased
meat
give
me
some
bread
and
cheese
i
say
do
know
what
you
call
too
good
but
it
ai
good
enough
for
me
for
i
call
it
as
tuf
as
laushong
and
that
will
bear
chawing
all
day
when
i
liquidate
for
my
dinner
i
like
to
get
about
the
best
that
goin
and
i
ai
a
bit
too
well
pleased
if
i
do
exciting
indeed
thinks
lord
i
should
like
to
see
you
excited
if
it
was
only
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
what
a
lookin
critter
you
be
among
the
gals
would
you
why
you
look
like
a
subject
the
doctor
boys
had
dropped
on
the
road
arter
they
had
dug
you
up
and
had
cut
stick
and
run
for
it
well
when
tea
came
he
said
the
same
thing
too
exciting
give
me
some
water
do
that
follorin
the
law
of
natur
says
i
that
the
case
you
ought
to
eat
beef
says
he
do
you
make
out
that
proposition
says
i
drinkin
water
instead
of
tea
is
natur
so
is
eatin
grass
to
natur
now
all
flesh
is
grass
we
are
told
so
you
had
better
eat
that
and
call
it
vegetable
like
a
man
i
once
seed
who
fasted
on
fish
on
a
friday
and
when
he
had
none
whipped
a
leg
o
mutton
into
the
oven
and
took
it
out
fish
says
he
it
plaice
all
and
plaice
ai
a
bad
fish
the
catholics
fast
enough
gracious
knows
but
then
they
fast
on
a
great
rousin
big
splendid
salmon
at
two
dollars
and
forty
cents
a
pound
and
lots
of
old
madeira
to
make
it
float
light
on
the
stomach
there
some
sense
in
mortifying
the
appetite
arter
that
fashion
but
plagy
little
in
your
way
no
says
i
you
may
talk
about
natur
as
you
please
i
studied
natur
all
my
life
and
i
vow
if
your
natur
could
speak
out
it
would
tell
you
it
do
over
half
like
to
be
starved
arter
that
plan
if
you
know
as
much
about
the
marks
of
the
mouth
as
i
do
you
know
that
you
have
carniverous
as
well
as
graniverous
teeth
and
that
natur
meant
by
that
you
should
eat
most
anything
that
your
nose
would
give
a
ticket
to
to
pass
into
your
mouth
father
rode
a
race
at
new
york
course
when
he
was
near
hand
to
seventy
and
that
more
nor
you
do
i
guess
and
he
eats
as
hearty
as
a
and
he
never
confined
himself
to
water
neither
when
he
could
get
anything
convened
him
better
says
he
sam
grandfather
slick
used
to
say
there
was
an
old
proverb
in
yorkshire
full
belly
makes
a
strong
back
and
i
guess
if
you
try
it
natur
will
tell
you
so
too
if
ever
you
go
to
connecticut
jist
call
into
father
and
he
give
you
a
real
right
down
genuine
new
england
breakfast
and
if
that
do
happify
your
heart
then
my
name
not
sam
slick
it
will
make
you
feel
about
among
the
stiffest
i
tell
you
it
will
blow
your
jacket
out
like
a
pig
at
sea
have
to
shake
a
reef
or
two
out
of
your
waistban
and
make
good
stowage
i
guess
to
carry
it
all
under
hatches
there
nothin
like
a
good
pastur
to
cover
the
ribs
and
make
the
hide
shine
depend
o
now
this
province
is
like
that
grahamite
lawyer
beef
too
good
for
the
folks
that
in
it
they
either
do
avail
its
value
or
wo
use
it
because
work
ai
arter
their
of
natur
as
you
say
they
are
quiet
enough
there
worse
folks
than
the
bluenoses
too
if
you
come
to
that
and
so
they
had
ought
to
be
quiet
for
they
have
nothin
to
fight
about
as
for
politics
they
have
nothin
to
desarve
the
name
but
they
talk
enough
about
it
and
a
plaguy
sight
of
nonsense
they
do
talk
too
now
with
us
the
country
is
divided
into
two
parties
of
the
mammouth
breed
the
ins
and
the
outs
the
administration
and
the
opposition
but
where
the
administration
here
where
the
war
office
the
foreign
office
and
the
home
office
where
the
secretary
of
the
navy
where
the
state
bank
where
the
ambassadors
and
diplomatists
them
are
the
boys
to
wind
off
a
snarl
of
ravellins
as
slick
as
if
it
were
on
a
reel
and
where
that
ship
of
state
fitted
up
all
the
way
from
the
forecastle
clean
up
to
the
chock
full
of
good
snug
berths
handsumly
found
and
furnished
tier
over
tier
one
above
another
as
thick
as
it
can
hold
that
a
helm
worth
handlin
i
tell
you
i
do
wonder
that
folks
mutiny
below
and
fight
on
the
decks
above
for
it
it
makes
a
plaguy
uproar
the
whole
time
and
keeps
the
passengers
for
everlastinly
in
a
state
of
alarm
for
fear
they
do
mischif
by
bustin
the
aground
or
gettin
foul
of
some
other
craft
this
province
is
better
as
it
is
quieter
and
happier
far
they
have
berths
enough
and
big
enough
they
should
be
careful
not
to
increase
and
if
they
were
to
do
it
over
agin
perhaps
they
be
as
well
with
fewer
they
have
two
parties
here
the
tory
party
and
the
opposition
party
and
both
on
run
to
extremes
them
radicals
says
one
are
for
levellin
all
down
to
their
own
level
tho
not
a
peg
lower
that
their
gage
jist
down
to
their
own
notch
and
no
further
and
they
agitate
the
whole
country
to
obtain
that
object
for
if
a
man
ca
grow
to
be
as
tall
as
his
neighbour
if
he
cuts
a
few
inches
off
him
why
then
they
are
both
of
one
heighth
they
are
a
most
dangerous
disaffected
people
they
are
eternally
appealin
to
the
worst
passions
of
the
mob
well
says
them
aristocrats
they
ruinate
the
country
they
spend
the
whole
revenue
on
themselves
what
with
bankers
councillors
judges
bishops
and
public
officers
and
a
whole
tribe
of
lawyers
as
hungry
as
hawks
and
jist
about
as
marciful
the
country
is
devoured
as
if
there
was
a
flock
of
locusts
on
it
there
nothin
left
for
roads
and
bridges
when
a
chap
sets
out
to
canvass
he
got
to
antagonize
one
side
or
if
he
hangs
on
to
the
powers
that
be
then
he
a
council
man
he
for
votin
large
salaries
for
doin
as
the
great
people
at
halifax
tell
him
he
is
a
fool
if
he
is
on
side
at
banks
judges
lawyers
and
such
cattle
and
bawlin
for
what
he
knows
he
ca
get
then
he
is
a
rogue
so
that
if
you
were
to
listen
to
the
weak
and
noisy
critters
on
both
sides
you
believe
the
house
of
assembly
was
one
half
rogues
and
half
fools
all
this
arises
from
ignorance
if
they
knew
more
of
each
other
i
guess
they
lay
aside
one
half
their
fears
and
all
their
abuse
the
upper
classes
do
know
one
half
the
virtue
that
in
the
middlin
and
lower
classes
and
they
do
know
one
half
the
integrity
and
good
feelin
that
in
the
others
and
both
are
fooled
and
gulled
by
their
own
noisy
and
designin
champions
take
any
two
men
that
are
by
the
ears
they
opinionate
all
they
hear
of
each
other
impute
all
sorts
of
onworthy
motives
and
misconstrue
every
act
let
them
see
more
of
each
other
and
they
find
out
to
their
surprise
that
they
have
not
only
been
lookin
through
a
magnifyin
glass
that
war
very
true
but
a
coloured
one
also
that
changed
the
complexion
and
distorted
the
feature
and
each
one
will
think
a
very
good
kind
of
chap
and
like
as
not
a
plaguy
pleasant
one
too
if
i
was
axed
which
side
was
farthest
from
the
mark
in
this
province
i
vow
i
should
be
puzzled
to
say
as
i
do
belong
to
the
country
and
do
care
a
snap
of
my
finger
for
either
of
i
suppose
i
can
judge
better
than
any
man
in
it
but
i
snore
i
do
think
there
much
difference
the
popular
side
i
wo
say
patriotic
for
we
find
in
our
steamboats
a
man
who
has
a
plaguy
sight
of
property
in
his
portmanter
is
quite
as
anxious
for
its
safety
as
him
that
only
one
pair
of
yarn
stockings
and
a
clean
shirt
is
for
the
popular
side
are
not
so
well
informed
as
and
they
have
the
misfortin
of
havin
their
passions
addressed
more
than
their
reason
therefore
they
are
often
out
of
the
way
or
rather
led
out
of
it
and
put
astray
by
bad
guides
well
side
have
the
prejudices
of
birth
and
education
to
dim
their
vision
and
are
alarmed
to
undertake
a
thing
from
the
dread
of
ambush
or
open
foes
that
their
guides
are
etarnally
descryin
in
the
mist
and
beside
power
has
a
nateral
tendency
to
corpulency
as
for
them
guides
make
short
work
of
if
it
was
me
in
the
last
war
with
britain
the
constitution
frigate
was
close
in
once
on
the
shores
of
ireland
arter
some
marchant
ships
and
she
took
on
board
a
pilot
well
he
was
a
deep
sly
twistical
lookin
chap
as
you
ever
seed
he
had
a
sort
of
dark
down
look
about
him
and
a
lear
out
of
the
corner
of
one
eye
like
a
horse
that
goin
to
kick
the
captain
guessed
he
read
in
his
face
now
if
i
was
to
run
this
here
yankee
right
slap
on
a
rock
and
bilge
her
the
king
would
make
a
man
of
me
for
ever
so
says
he
to
the
first
leftenant
a
rope
through
that
block
at
the
tip
eend
of
the
fore
yard
and
clap
a
runnin
noose
in
it
the
leftenant
did
it
as
quick
as
wink
and
came
back
and
says
he
guess
done
says
the
captain
here
pilot
here
a
rope
you
hai
seed
yet
i
jist
explain
the
use
of
it
to
you
in
case
you
want
the
loan
of
it
if
this
here
frigate
manned
with
our
free
and
enlightened
citizens
gets
aground
i
give
you
a
ride
on
the
slack
of
that
rope
right
up
to
that
yard
by
the
neck
by
gum
well
it
rub
all
the
writin
out
of
his
face
as
quick
as
spittin
on
a
slate
takes
a
sum
out
you
may
depend
now
they
should
rig
up
a
crane
over
the
street
door
of
the
state
house
at
halifax
and
when
any
of
the
pilots
at
either
eend
of
the
buildin
run
on
the
breakers
on
purpose
string
up
like
an
onsafe
dog
a
sign
of
that
kind
with
house
of
public
entertainment
painted
under
it
would
do
the
business
in
less
than
no
time
if
it
would
keep
the
hawks
out
of
the
poultry
yard
it
a
pity
it
would
scare
them
out
of
a
year
growth
that
a
fact
if
they
used
it
once
i
guess
they
would
have
occasion
for
it
agin
in
a
hurry
it
would
be
like
the
aloe
tree
and
that
bears
fruit
only
once
in
a
hundred
years
if
you
want
to
know
how
to
act
any
time
squire
never
go
to
books
leave
them
to
gals
and
school
boys
but
go
right
off
and
cipher
it
out
of
natur
that
a
sure
guide
it
will
never
deceive
you
you
may
depend
for
instance
that
to
me
is
a
phrase
so
common
that
it
shows
it
a
natural
one
when
people
have
no
particular
interest
in
a
thing
well
when
a
feller
gets
so
warm
on
either
side
as
never
to
use
that
phrase
at
all
watch
him
that
all
keep
your
eye
on
him
or
he
walk
right
into
you
afore
you
know
where
you
be
if
a
man
runs
to
me
and
says
fence
is
down
you
says
i
kind
if
he
comes
agin
and
says
guess
some
stray
cattle
have
broke
into
your
short
sarce
garden
i
thank
him
agin
says
i
now
this
is
neighbourly
but
when
he
keeps
etarnally
tellin
me
this
thing
of
one
sarvant
and
that
thing
of
another
sarvant
hints
that
my
friends
ai
true
that
my
neighbours
are
inclined
to
take
advantage
of
me
and
that
suspicious
folks
are
seen
about
my
place
i
say
to
myself
what
on
airth
makes
this
critter
take
such
a
wonderful
interest
in
my
affairs
i
do
like
to
hear
such
tales
he
arter
somethin
as
sure
as
the
world
if
he
he
say
that
to
me
i
never
believe
much
what
i
hear
said
by
a
man
violent
friend
or
violent
enemy
i
want
to
hear
what
a
disinterested
man
has
to
say
now
as
a
disinterested
man
i
say
if
the
members
of
the
house
of
assembly
instead
of
raisin
up
ghosts
and
hobgoblins
to
frighten
folks
with
and
to
show
what
swordsmen
they
be
and
at
those
phantoms
that
only
exist
in
their
own
brains
would
turn
to
heart
and
hand
and
develop
the
resources
of
this
fine
country
facilitate
the
means
of
transport
promote
its
internal
improvement
and
encourage
its
foreign
trade
they
would
make
it
the
richest
and
greatest
as
it
now
is
one
of
the
happiest
sections
of
all
america
i
hope
i
may
be
skinned
if
they
would
they
would
i
swan

the
clockmaker
quilts
a
bluenose
the
descendants
of
eve
have
profited
little
by
her
example
the
curiosity
of
the
fair
sex
is
still
insatiable
and
as
it
is
often
ill
directed
it
frequently
terminates
in
error
in
the
country
this
feminine
propensity
is
troublesome
to
a
traveller
and
he
who
would
avoid
importunities
would
do
well
to
announce
at
once
on
his
arrival
at
a
cumberland
inn
his
name
and
his
business
the
place
of
his
abode
and
the
length
of
his
visit
our
beautiful
hostess
pugwash
as
she
took
her
seat
at
the
breakfast
table
this
morning
exhibited
the
example
that
suggested
these
reflections
she
was
struck
with
horror
at
our
conversation
the
latter
part
only
of
which
she
heard
and
of
course
misapplied
and
misunderstood
she
was
run
down
by
the
president
said
i
and
has
been
laid
up
for
some
time
gulard
people
have
stripped
her
in
consequence
of
her
making
water
so
fast
stripped
whom
said
pugwash
as
she
suddenly
dropped
the
teapot
from
her
hand
stripped
whom
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
who
it
is
the
lady
ogle
said
i
lady
ogle
said
she
how
horrid
two
of
her
ribs
were
so
broken
as
to
require
to
be
replaced
with
new
ones
two
new
ribs
said
she
well
i
never
heerd
the
beat
of
that
in
all
my
born
days
poor
critter
how
she
must
have
suffered
on
examining
her
below
the
waist
they
found
examining
her
still
lower
said
she
all
the
pride
of
her
sex
revolting
at
the
idea
of
such
an
indecent
exhibition
you
pretend
to
say
they
stripped
her
below
the
waist
what
did
the
admiral
say
did
he
stand
by
and
see
her
handled
in
that
way
the
admiral
madam
said
i
did
not
trouble
his
head
about
it
they
found
her
extremely
unsound
there
and
much
she
continued
how
awful
it
must
have
been
them
nasty
jiggers
that
got
in
there
they
tell
me
they
are
dreadful
thick
in
the
west
indies
joe
crow
had
them
in
his
feet
and
lost
two
of
his
toes
dear
dear
but
still
that
ai
so
bad
as
having
them
great
strip
one
i
promise
you
if
them
gulards
had
undertaken
to
strip
me
i
a
taught
them
different
guess
manners
i
a
died
first
before
i
a
submitted
to
it
i
always
heerd
tell
the
english
quality
ladies
were
awful
bold
but
i
never
heerd
the
like
o
that
what
on
airth
are
you
drivin
at
said
slick
i
never
seed
you
so
much
out
in
your
latitude
afore
marm
i
vow
we
were
talkin
of
reparin
a
vessel
not
strippin
a
woman
what
under
the
sun
could
have
put
that
crotchet
into
your
head
she
looked
mortified
and
humbled
at
the
result
of
her
own
absurd
curiosity
and
soon
quitted
the
room
i
thought
i
should
have
snorted
right
out
two
or
three
times
said
the
clockmaker
i
had
to
pucker
up
my
mouth
like
the
upper
eend
of
a
silk
puss
to
keep
from
yawhawin
in
her
face
to
hear
the
critter
let
her
clapper
run
that
fashion
she
is
not
the
first
hand
that
has
caught
a
lobster
by
puttin
in
her
oar
afore
her
turn
i
guess
she
mind
her
steps
next
hitch
i
reckon
this
was
our
last
breakfast
at
amherst
an
early
frost
that
smote
the
potato
fields
and
changed
the
beautiful
green
colour
of
the
indian
corn
into
shades
of
light
yellow
and
dark
brown
reminded
me
of
the
presence
of
autumn
of
the
season
of
short
days
and
bad
roads
i
determined
to
proceed
at
once
to
parrsboro
and
thence
by
the
windsor
and
kentville
route
to
annapolis
yarmouth
and
shelburne
and
to
return
by
the
shore
road
through
liverpool
and
lunenburg
to
halifax
i
therefore
took
leave
though
not
without
much
reluctance
of
the
clockmaker
whose
intention
had
been
to
go
to
fort
lawrence
well
said
he
i
vow
i
am
sorry
to
part
company
along
with
you
a
considerable
long
journey
like
is
like
sitting
up
late
with
the
gals
a
body
knows
it
getting
on
pretty
well
towards
mornin
and
yet
feels
loth
to
go
to
bed
for
it
just
the
time
folks
grow
sociable
i
got
a
scheme
in
my
head
said
he
that
i
think
will
answer
both
on
us
i
got
debts
due
to
me
in
all
them
places
for
clocks
sold
by
the
consarn
now
suppose
you
leave
your
horse
on
these
mashes
this
fall
he
get
as
fat
as
a
fool
he
wo
be
able
to
see
out
of
his
eyes
in
a
month
and
i
put
clay
i
call
him
clay
arter
our
senator
who
is
a
prime
bit
of
stuff
into
a
yankee
wagon
i
have
here
and
drive
you
all
round
the
coast
this
was
too
good
an
offer
to
be
declined
a
run
at
grass
for
my
horse
an
easy
and
comfortable
wagon
and
a
guide
so
original
and
amusing
as
slick
were
either
of
them
enough
to
induce
my
acquiescence
as
soon
as
we
had
taken
our
seats
in
the
wagon
he
observed
we
shall
progress
real
handsum
now
that
horse
goes
etarnal
fast
he
near
about
set
my
axle
on
fire
twice
he
a
spanker
you
may
depend
i
had
him
when
he
was
a
all
legs
and
tail
like
a
devil
darnin
needle
and
had
him
broke
on
purpose
by
old
nigger
january
snow
he
knows
english
real
well
and
can
do
near
about
anything
but
speak
it
he
helped
me
once
to
gin
a
bluenose
a
proper
handsum
quiltin
he
must
have
stood
a
poor
chance
indeed
said
i
a
horse
kickin
and
a
man
striking
him
at
the
same
time
oh
not
arter
that
pattern
at
all
said
he
lord
if
old
clay
had
kicked
him
he
a
smashed
him
like
that
sarcer
you
broke
at
pugnose
inn
into
ten
hundred
thousand
million
flinders
oh
no
if
i
did
fix
his
flint
for
him
in
fair
play
it
a
pity
i
tell
you
how
it
was
i
was
up
to
truro
at
ezra
whitter
inn
there
was
an
arbitration
there
atween
deacon
text
and
deacon
faithful
well
there
was
a
sight
of
folks
there
for
they
said
it
was
a
biter
bit
and
they

well
i

little
business
there

a
yankee
peddler
a
cheatin
vagabond
a
wooden
nutmeg
and
threw
a
good
deal
of
assorted
hardware
of
that
kind
at
me
and
the
crowd
of
folks
cried

yankee

and
they

on
pretty
high
i

all
up
on

clever
chance
i
give
you
such
a
quiltin
as
you
never
had
since
you
were
raised
from
a
seedlin
i
vow
so
says
i
bradley
i
guess
you
had
better
let
me
be
you
know
i
ca
fight
no
more
than
a
cow
i
never
was
brought
up
to
wranglin
and
i
do
like
it
off
the
cowardly
rascal
they
all
bawled
out
him
off
and
lay
it
into
him
so
he
lays
right
hold
of
me
by
the
collar
and
gives
me
a
pull
and
i
lets
on
as
if
i
lost
my
balance
and
falls
right
down
then
i
jumps
up
on
eend
and
says
i
ahead
clay
and
the
old
horse
he
sets
off
a
head
so
i
knew
i
had
him
when
i
wanted
him
then
says
i
hope
you
are
satisfied
now
bradley
with
that
ungenteel
fall
you
gin
me
well
he
makes
a
blow
at
me
and
i
dodged
it
says
i
be
sorry
for
this
i
tell
you
i
wo
be
treated
this
way
for
nothin
i
go
right
off
and
swear
my
life
agin
you
i
most
afeerd
you
murder
me
well
he
strikes
at
me
agin
thinkin
he
had
a
genuine
soft
horn
to
deal
with
and
hits
me
in
the
shoulder
says
i
i
wo
stand
here
to
be
lathered
like
a
dog
all
day
long
this
fashion
it
ai
pretty
at
all
i
guess
i
give
you
a
chase
for
it
off
i
sets
arter
my
horse
like
mad
and
he
arter
me
i
did
that
to
get
clear
of
the
crowd
so
that
i
might
have
fair
play
at
him
well
i
soon
found
i
had
the
heels
of
him
and
could
play
him
as
i
liked
then
i
slackened
up
a
little
and
when
he
came
close
up
to
me
so
as
nearly
to
lay
his
hand
upon
me
i
squatted
right
whap
down
all
short
and
he
pitched
over
me
near
about
a
rod
or
so
i
guess
on
his
head
and
ploughed
up
the
ground
with
his
nose
the
matter
of
a
foot
or
two
if
he
did
polish
up
the
coulter
and
both
mould
boards
of
his
face
it
a
pity
says
i
had
better
lay
where
you
be
and
let
me
go
for
i
am
proper
tired
i
blow
like
a
horse
that
got
the
heaves
and
besides
says
i
guess
you
had
better
wash
your
face
for
i
am
most
a
feared
you
hurt
yourself
that
riled
him
properly
i
meant
that
it
should
so
he
ups
and
at
me
awful
spiteful
like
a
bull
then
i
lets
him
have
it
right
left
right
jist
three
corkers
beginning
with
the
right
hand
shifting
to
the
left
and
then
with
the
right
hand
agin
this
way
i
did
it
said
the
clockmaker
and
he
showed
me
the
manner
in
which
it
was
done
it
a
beautiful
way
of
hitting
and
always
does
the
business
a
blow
for
each
eye
and
one
for
the
mouth
it
sounds
like
ten
pounds
ten
on
a
blacksmith
anvil
i
bunged
up
both
eyes
for
him
and
put
in
the
dead
lights
in
two
tu
and
drew
three
of
his
teeth
quicker
a
plaguy
sight
than
the
truro
doctor
could
to
save
his
soul
alive
says
i
friend
when
you
recover
your
i
guess
you
see
your
mistake
i
war
born
in
the
woods
to
be
scared
by
an
owl
the
next
time
you
feel
in
a
most
particular
elegant
good
humour
come
to
me
and
i
play
you
the
second
part
of
that
identical
same
tune
that
a
fact
with
that
i
whistled
for
old
clay
and
back
he
comes
and
i
mounted
and
off
jist
as
the
crowd
came
up
the
folks
looked
staggered
and
wondered
a
little
grain
how
it
was
done
so
cleverly
in
short
metre
if
i
did
quilt
him
in
no
time
you
may
depend
i
went
right
slap
into
him
like
a
flash
of
lightning
into
a
gooseberry
bush
he
found
his
suit
ready
made
and
fitted
afore
he
thought
he
was
half
measured
thinks
i
friend
bradley
i
hope
you
know
yourself
now
for
i
vow
no
livin
soul
would
your
swallowed
your
soup
without
singin
out
scaldin
and
your
near
about
a
pint
and
a
half
nearer
cryin
than
larfin
yes
as
i
was
sayin
this
old
clay
is
a
real
knowin
one
he
as
spry
as
a
colt
yet
clear
grit
ginger
to
the
backbone
i
ca
help
sometimes
the
breed
must
have
come
from
old
kentuck
half
horse
half
alligator
with
a
cross
of
the

hope
i
may
be
teetotally
ruinated
if
i
take
eight
hundred
dollars
for
him

said
the
clockmaker
they
remind
me
of
a
trap
jim
munroe
put
his
foot
in
one
night
that
near
about
made
one
leg
half
a
yard
longer
than
i
believe
i
told
you
of
him
what
a
desperate
idle
feller
he
was
he
came
from
onion
county
in
connecticut
well
he
was
courtin
sister
sall
she
was
a
real
handsum
lookin
gal
you
scarce
ever
seed
a
more
out
and
out
complete
critter
than
she
was
a
fine
figur
head
and
a
beautiful
model
of
a
craft
as
any
in
the
state
a
real
clipper
and
as
full
of
fun
and
frolic
as
a
kitten
well
he
fairly
turned
head
the
more
we
wanted
her
to
give
him
up
the
more
she
would
and
we
got
plaguy
oneasy
about
it
for
his
character
was
none
of
the
best
he
was
a
univarsal
favourite
among
the
gals
and
tho
he
behave
very
pretty
neither
forgetting
to
marry
where
he
promised
and
where
he
had
ought
to
have
forgot
too
yet
so
it
was
he
had
such
an
uncommon
winnin
way
with
him
he
could
talk
them
over
in
no
time
sall
was
fairly
bewitched
at
last
father
said
to
him
one
evening
when
he
came
says
he
never
come
to
no
good
if
you
act
like
old
scratch
as
you
do
you
ai
fit
to
come
into
no
decent
man
house
at
all
and
your
absence
would
be
ten
times
more
agreeable
than
your
company
i
tell
you
i
wo
consent
to
sall
goin
to
them
huskin
parties
and
quiltin
frolics
along
with
you
no
more
on
no
account
for

and
nancy
white

he
do
uncle
sam
say
no
more
about
that
if
you
knowed
all
you
would
say
it
was
my
fault
and
besides
i
have
turned
right
about
i
am
on
tack
now
and
the
long
leg
too
i
am
as
steady
as
a
pump
bolt
now
i
intend
to
settle
myself
and
take
a
farm
yes
and
you
could
stock
it
too
by
all
accounts
pretty
well
unless
you
are
much
misreported
says
father
it
do
i
knew
your
father
he
was
our
sargeant
a
proper
clever
and
brave
man
he
was
too
he
was
one
of
the
heroes
of
our
glorious
revolution
i
had
a
great
respect
for
him
and
i
am
sorry
for
his
sake
you
will
act
as
you
do
but
i
tell
you
once
for
all
you
must
give
up
all
thoughts
of
sall
now
and
for
everlastin
when
sall
heerd
this
she
began
to
knit
away
like
mad
in
a
desperate
hurry
she
looked
foolish
enough
that
a
fact
first
she
tried
to
bite
in
her
breath
and
look
as
if
there
was
nothin
particular
in
the
wind
then
she
blushed
all
over
like
scarlet
fever
but
she
recovered
that
pretty
soon
and
then
her
colour
went
and
came
and
came
and
went
till
at
last
she
grew
as
white
as
chalk
and
down
she
fell
slap
off
her
seat
on
the
floor
in
a
faintin
fit
see
says
father
see
it
now
you
etarnal
villain
and
he
made
a
pull
at
the
old
fashioned
sword
that
always
hung
over
the
fireplace
we
used
to
call
it
old
bunker
for
his
stories
always
begun
i
was
at
hill
and
drawing
it
out
he
made
a
clip
at
him
as
wicked
as
if
he
was
stabbing
at
a
rat
with
a
hay
fork
but
jim
he
outs
of
the
door
like
a
shot
and
draws
it
too
arter
him
and
father
sends
old
bunker
right
through
the
panel
chop
you
up
as
fine
as
mince
meat
you
villain
said
he
ever
i
catch
you
inside
my
door
agin
mind
what
i
tell
you
you
swing
for
it
yet
well
he
made
himself
considerable
scarce
arter
that
he
never
sot
foot
inside
the
door
agin
and
i
thought
he
had
gin
up
all
hopes
of
sall
and
she
of
him
when
one
night
a
most
particular
uncommon
dark
night
as
i
was
home
from
neighbour
dearborne
i
heerd
some
one
under
sall
window
well
i
stops
and
listens
and
who
should
it
be
near
the
ash
saplin
but
jim
munroe
to
persuade
sall
to
run
off
with
him
to
rhode
island
to
be
married
it
was
all
settled
he
should
come
with
a
horse
and
shay
to
the
gate
and
then
help
her
out
of
the
window
jist
at
nine
about
the
time
she
commonly
went
to
bed
then
he
axes
her
to
reach
down
her
hand
for
him
to
kiss
for
he
was
proper
clever
at
soft
sawder
and
she
stretches
it
down
and
he
kisses
it
and
says
he
believe
i
must
have
the
whole
of
you
out
arter
all
and
gives
her
a
jirk
that
kinder
startled
her
it
came
so
sudden
like
it
made
her
scream
so
off
he
sot
hot
foot
and
over
the
gate
in
no
time
well
i
ciphered
over
this
all
night
how
i
should
reciprocate
that
trick
with
him
and
at
last
i
hit
on
a
scheme
i
recollected
father
words
at
partin
what
i
tell
you
swing
for
it
yet
and
thinks
i
friend
jim
i
make
that
prophecy
come
true
yet
i
guess
so
the
next
night
jist
at
dark
i
gives
january
snow
the
old
nigger
a
nidge
with
my
elbow
and
as
soon
as
he
looks
up
i
winks
and
walks
out
and
he
arter
me
says
i
can
you
keep
your
tongue
within
your
teeth
you
old
nigger
you
massa
why
you
ax
that
question
my
gor
you
tink
old
snow
he
do
know
dat
yet
my
tongue
he
got
plenty
room
now
debil
a
tooth
left
he
can
stretch
out
ever
so
far
like
a
little
leg
in
a
big
bed
he
lay
quiet
enough
massa
neber
fear
then
says
i
down
that
ash
saplin
softly
you
old
snowball
and
make
no
noise
the
saplin
was
no
sooner
bent
than
secured
to
the
ground
by
a
notched
peg
and
a
noose
and
a
was
suspended
from
the
tree
jist
over
the
track
that
led
from
the
pathway
to
the
house
my
gor
massa
that
a
your
mug
you
old
nigger
says
i
i
send
your
tongue
arter
your
teeth
keep
quiet
and
follow
me
in
presently
well
jist
as
it
struck
nine
says
i
hold
this
here
hank
of
twine
for
a
minute
till
i
wind
a
trifle
on
it
off
a
dear
critter
she
sot
down
her
candle
and
i
put
the
twine
on
her
hands
and
then
i
begins
to
wind
and
wind
away
ever
so
slow
and
drops
the
ball
every
now
and
then
so
as
to
keep
her
downstairs
says
she
do
believe

noise
of

heaven
sake
lord
be
praised
said
father
poor
sinner
is
not
quite
dead
yet
why
as
i
alive
well
if
that
do
beat
all
natur
why
he
has
hanged
himself
by
one
leg
and
like
a
rabbit
upside
down
that
a
fact
why
if
he
ai
snared
sam
he
is
properly
wired
i
declare
i
vow
this
is
some
o
your
doin
sam
well
it
was
a
clever
scheme
too
but
a
little
grain
too
dangerous
i
guess
stand
staring
and
jawin
there
all
night
said
jim
me
down
i
tell
you
or
cut
my
throat
and
be
damned
to
you
for
i
am
chokin
with
blood
over
that
hogshead
old
snow
said
i
i
get
atop
on
it
and
cut
him
down
so
i
soon
released
him
but
he
walk
a
bit
his
ankle
was
swelled
and
sprained
like
vengeance
and
he
swore
one
leg
was
near
about
six
inches
longer
than
munroe
says
father
did
i
think
i
should
ever
see
you
inside
my
door
agin
but
i
bid
you
enter
now
we
owe
you
that
kindness
anyhow
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
jim
was
so
and
so
down
in
the
mouth
he
begged
for
heaven
sake
it
might
be
kept
a
secret
he
said
he
would
run
the
state
if
ever
it
got
wind
he
was
sure
he
could
stand
it
will
be
one
while
i
guess
said
father
you
are
able
to
run
or
stand
either
but
if
you
will
give
me
your
hand
jim
and
promise
to
give
over
your
evil
ways
i
will
not
only
keep
it
secret
but
you
shall
be
a
welcome
guest
at
old
sam
slick
once
more
for
the
sake
of
your
father
he
was
a
brave
man
one
of
the
heroes
of
bunker
hill
he
was
our
sergeant
and
promises
says
i
for
the
old
man
had
stuck
his
right
foot
out
the
way
he
always
stood
when
he
told
about
the
old
war
and
as
jim
could
stir
a
peg
it
was
a
grand
chance
and
he
was
to
give
him
the
whole
revolution
from
general
gage
up
to
independence
promises
says
i
well
it
was
all
settled
and
things
soon
grew
as
calm
as
a
pan
of
milk
two
days
old
and
afore
a
year
was
over
jim
was
as
steady
man
as
minister
joshua
hopewell
and
was
married
to
our
sall
nothin
was
ever
said
about
the
snare
till
arter
the
weddin
when
the
minister
had
finished
axin
a
blessin
father
goes
up
to
jim
and
says
he
munroe
my
boy
givin
him
a
rousin
slap
on
the
shoulder
that
sot
him
for
the
matter
of
five
minutes
for
he
was
a
mortal
powerful
man
was
father
munroe
my
boy
says
he
got
the
snare
round
your
neck
i
guess
now
instead
of
your
leg
the
saplin
has
been
a
father
to
you
may
you
be
the
father
of
many
saplin
we
had
a
most
special
time
of
it
you
may
depend
all
except
the
minister
father
got
him
into
a
corner
and
gave
him
chapter
and
verse
for
the
whole
war
every
now
and
then
as
i
come
near
them
i
heard
bunker
hill
brandywine
clinton
gates
and
so
on
it
was
broad
day
when
we
parted
and
the
last
that
went
was
poor
minister
father
followed
him
clean
down
to
the
gate
and
says
he
we
had
time
this
hitch
or
i
a
told
you
all
about
the
evakyation
of
new
york
but
i
tell
you
that
the
next
time
we
meet
no
xxi
setting
up
for
governor
i
never
see
one
of
them
queer
little
teapots
like
that
in
the
cupboard
of
marm
pugwash
said
the
clockmaker
that
i
do
think
of
lawyer
crowningshield
and
his
wife
when
i
was
down
to
rhode
island
last
i
spent
an
evening
with
them
arter
i
had
been
there
a
while
the
black
brought
in
a
little
home
made
dipped
candle
stuck
in
a
turnip
sliced
in
two
to
make
it
stand
straight
and
set
it
down
on
the
table
says
the
lawyer
to
his
wife
my
dear
what
on
airth
is
the
meanin
o
that
what
does
little
viney
mean
by
bringin
in
such
a
light
as
this
that
ai
fit
for
even
a
log
hut
of
one
of
our
free
and
enlightened
citizens
away
down
east
where
the
lamp
dear
says
she
ordered
it
you
know
they
are
to
set
you
up
for
governor
next
year
and
i
allot
we
must
economize
or
we
will
be
ruined
the
salary
is
only
four
hundred
dollars
a
year
you
know
and
you
have
to
give
up
your
practice
we
ca
afford
nothin
now
well
when
tea
was
brought
in
there
was
a
little
wee
china
teapot
that
held
about
the
matter
of
half
a
pint
or
so
and
cups
and
sarcers
about
the
bigness
of
children
toys
when
he
seed
that
he
grew
most
peskily
riled
his
under
lip
curled
down
like
a
peach
leaf
that
got
a
worm
in
it
and
he
stripped
his
teeth
and
showed
his
grinders
like
a
foolery
is
this
said
he
dear
said
she
the
foolery
of
being
governor
if
you
choose
to
sacrifice
all
your
comfort
to
being
the
first
rung
in
the
ladder
do
blame
me
for
it
i
did
nominate
you
i
had
not
art
nor
part
in
it
it
was
cooked
up
at
that
convention
at
town
hall
well
he
sot
for
some
time
without
sayin
a
word
lookin
as
black
as
a
thunder
cloud
just
ready
to
make
all
natur
crack
agin
at
last
he
gets
up
and
walks
round
behind
his
wife
chair
and
takin
her
face
between
his
two
hands
he
turns
it
up
and
gives
her
a
buss
that
went
off
like
a
pistol
it
fairly
made
my
mouth
water
to
see
him
thinks
i
them
lips
ai
a
bad
bank
to
deposit
one
spare
kisses
in
neither
my
dear
said
he
believe
you
are
half
right
decline
tomorrow
i
have
nothin
to
do
with
it
i
wo
be
a
governor
on
no
account
well
she
had
to
haw
and
gee
like
both
a
little
afore
she
could
get
her
head
out
of
his
hands
and
then
she
said
says
she
you
do
act
ai
you
ashamed
do
for
gracious
sake
behave
yourself
and
she
coloured
up
all
over
like
a
crimson
piany
you
hav
foozled
all
my
hair
too
that
a
fact
says
she
and
she
put
her
curls
to
rights
and
looked
as
pleased
as
fun
though
all
the
time
and
walked
right
out
of
the
room
presently
in
come
two
well
dressed
one
with
a
splendid
gilt
lamp
a
real
london
touch
and
another
with
a
tea
tray
with
a
large
solid
silver
coffee
pot
and
teapot
and
a
cream
jug
and
sugar
bowl
of
the
same
genuine
metal
and
a
most
an
elegant
set
of
real
gilt
china
then
in
came
marm
crowningshield
herself
lookin
as
proud
as
if
she
would
not
call
the
president
her
cousin
and
she
gave
the
lawyer
a
look
as
much
as
to
say
i
guess
when
slick
is
gone
i
pay
you
off
that
kiss
with
interest
you
dear
you
i
answer
a
bill
at
sight
for
it
i
will
you
may
depend
believe
said
he
agin
are
right
increase
my
dear
it
an
expensive
kind
of
honour
that
bein
governor
and
no
great
thanks
neither
great
cry
and
little
wool
all
talk
and
no
cider
it
enough
i
guess
for
a
man
to
govern
his
own
family
ai
it
dear
my
love
said
she
a
man
is
never
so
much
in
his
own
proper
sphere
as
there
and
beside
said
she
will
is
supreme
to
home
there
is
no
danger
of
any
one
him
there
and
she
gave
me
a
sly
look
as
much
as
to
say
i
let
him
think
he
is
master
in
his
own
house
for
when
ladies
wear
the
breeches
their
petticoats
ought
to
be
long
enough
to
hide
them
but
i
allot
slick
you
can
see
with
half
an
eye
that
the
mare
is
the
better
horse
here
what
a
pity
it
is
continued
the
clockmaker
that
the
bluenoses
would
not
take
a
leaf
out
of
marm
crowninshield
book
talk
more
of
their
own
affairs
and
less
of
politics
i
sick
of
the
sound
of
of
assembly
and
and
folks
they
never
alleviate
talking
about
them
from
july
to
etarnity
i
had
a
curious
conversation
about
politics
once
away
up
to
the
right
here
do
you
see
that
house
said
he
in
the
field
that
got
a
lurch
to
leeward
like
a
north
river
sloop
struck
with
a
squall
off
west
point
lopsided
like
it
looks
like
seth
pine
a
tailor
down
to
hartford
that
had
one
leg
shorter
than
when
he
stood
at
ease
at
militia
trainin
on
the
littlest
one
well
i
had
a
special
frolic
there
the
last
time
i
passed
this
way
i
lost
the
linch
pin
out
of
my
forrard
axle
and
i
turned
up
there
to
get
it
sot
to
rights
just
as
i
drove
through
the
gate
i
saw
the
eldest
gal
for
the
house
for
dear
life
she
had
a
short
petticoat
on
that
looked
like
a
kilt
and
her
bare
legs
put
me
in
mind
of
the
long
shanks
of
a
bittern
down
in
a
rush
swamp
away
like
mad
full
chisel
arter
a
frog
i
could
think
what
on
airth
was
the
matter
thinks
i
she
wants
to
make
herself
look
decent
like
afore
i
get
in
she
do
like
to
pull
her
stockings
on
afore
me
so
i
pulls
up
the
old
horse
and
let
her
have
a
fair
start
well
when
i
came
to
the
door
i
heard
a
proper
scuddin
there
was
a
regular
flight
into
egypt
jist
such
a
noise
as
little
children
make
when
the
mistress
comes
suddenly
into
school
all
and
scroudgin
into
their
seats
as
quick
as
wink
me
says
the
old
woman
as
she
put
her
head
out
of
a
broken
window
to
avail
who
it
was
it
you
slick
i
sniggers
if
you
did
frighten
us
properly
we
actilly
thought
it
was
the
sheriff
do
come
in
poor
thing
she
looked
half
starved
and
half
savage
hunger
and
temper
had
made
proper
strong
lines
in
her
face
like
water
furrows
in
a
ploughed
field
she
looked
bony
and
thin
like
a
horse
that
has
had
more
work
than
oats
and
had
a
wicked
expression
as
though
it
war
over
safe
to
come
too
near
her
heels
an
everlastin
kicker
may
come
out
john
said
she
to
her
husband
only
slick
and
out
came
john
from
under
the
bed
backwards
on
all
fours
like
an
ox
out
of
the
shoein
frame
or
a
lobster
skullin
wrong
eend
foremost
he
looked
as
wild
as
a
hawk
well
i
swan
i
thought
i
should
have
split
i
could
hardly
keep
from
bustin
right
out
with
larfter
he
was
all
covered
with
feathers
lint
and
dust
the
of
all
the
sweepin
since
the
house
was
built
shoved
under
there
for
tidiness
he
actilly
sneezed
for
the
matter
of
ten
minutes
he
seemed
half
choked
with
the
flaff
and
stuff
that
came
out
with
him
like
a
cloud
lord
he
looked
like
a
goose
half
picked
as
if
all
the
quills
were
gone
but
the
and
down
were
left
jist
ready
for
singein
and
stuffin
he
put
me
in
mind
of
a
sick
adjutant
a
great
tall
hulkin
bird
that
comes
from
the
east
indgies
as
high
as
a
man
and
most
as
knowin
as
a
bluenose
i
a
gin
a
hundred
dollars
to
have
had
that
chap
as
a
show
at
a
fair
tar
and
feathers
war
half
as
nateral
you
seen
a
gal
both
larf
and
cry
at
the
same
time
hai
you
well
i
hope
i
may
be
shot
if
i
could
have
done
the
same
to
see
that
critter
come
like
a
turkey
out
of
a
bag
at
christmas
to
be
fired
at
for
ten
cents
a
shot
was
as
good
as
a
play
but
to
look
round
and
see
the
poverty
the
children
the
old
pine
stumps
for
chairs
a
small
bin
of
poor
watery
yaller
potatoes
in
the
corner
daylight
through
the
sides
and
roof
of
the
house
lookin
like
the
tarred
seams
of
a
ship
all
black
where
the
smoke
got
out
no
utensils
for
cookin
or
eatin
and
starvation
wrote
as
plain
as
a
handbill
on
their
holler
cheeks
skinney
fingers
and
sunk
eyes
went
right
straight
to
the
heart
i
do
declare
i
believe
i
should
have
cried
only
they
did
seem
to
mind
it
themselves
they
had
been
used
to
it
like
a
man
that
married
to
a
thunderin
ugly
wife
he
gets
so
accustomed
to
the
look
of
her
everlastin
dismal
mug
that
he
do
think
her
ugly
at
all
well
there
was
another
chap
by
the
fire
and
he
did
look
as
if
he
saw
it
and
felt
it
too
he
did
seem
over
half
pleased
you
may
depend
he
was
the
district
schoolmaster
and
he
told
me
he
was
takin
a
spell
at
boardin
there
for
it
was
their
turn
to
keep
him
thinks
i
to
myself
poor
devil
you
brought
your
pigs
to
a
pretty
market
that
a
fact
i
see
how
it
is
the
bluenoses
cipher
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
now
it
no
wonder
they
do
go
ahead
for
they
do
know
nothin
the
is
abroad
with
the
devil
to
it
for
he
has
no
home
at
all
why
squire
you
might
jist
as
well
expect
a
horse
to
go
right
off
in
gear
before
he
is
halter
broke
as
a
bluenose
to
get
on
in
the
world
when
he
has
got
no
schoolin
but
to
get
back
to
my
story
says
i
times
with
you
mrs
spry
says
she
dull
there
no
markets
now
things
do
fetch
nothin
thinks
i
some
folks
had
ought
to
complain
of
markets
for
they
do
raise
nothin
to
sell
but
i
did
say
so
for
poverty
is
keen
enough
without
sharpening
its
edge
by
pokin
fun
at
it
says
i
fetch
a
good
price
this
fall
for
it
a
short
crop
in
a
general
way
says
she
complete
as
you
ever
seed
our
tops
were
small
and
did
look
well
but
we
have
the
handsomest
bottoms
it
generally
allowed
in
all
our
place
you
never
seed
the
best
of
them
they
are
actilly
worth
lookin
at
i
vow
i
had
to
take
a
chaw
of
tobaccy
to
keep
from
snortin
right
out
it
sounded
so
queer
like
thinks
i
to
myself
old
lady
it
a
pity
you
could
be
changed
eend
for
eend
then
as
some
folks
do
their
stockings
it
would
improve
the
look
of
your
then
that
a
fact
now
there
was
human
natur
squire
said
the
clockmaker
there
was
pride
even
in
that
hovel
it
is
found
in
rags
as
well
as
robes
where
butter
is
spread
with
the
thumb
as
well
as
the
silver
knife
natur
is
natur
wherever
you
find
it
jist
then
in
came
one
or
two
neighbours
to
see
the
sport
for
they
took
me
for
a
sheriff
or
constable
or
something
of
that
breed
and
when
they
saw
it
was
me
they
sot
down
to
hear
the
news
they
fell
right
too
at
politics
as
keen
as
anything
as
if
it
had
been
a
dish
of
real
connecticut
slapjacks
or
hominy
or
what
is
better
still
a
glass
of
real
genuine
splendid
mint
julep
it
fairly
makes
my
mouth
water
to
think
of
it
wonder
says
one
they
will
do
for
us
this
winter
in
the
house
of
assembly
says
the
other
never
do
nothin
but
what
the
great
people
at
halifax
tell
squire
yeoman
is
the
man
he
pay
up
the
great
folks
this
hitch
he
let
have
their
own
he
jist
the
boy
that
can
do
it
says
i
wish
i
could
say
all
men
were
as
honest
then
for
i
am
afeard
there
are
a
great
many
wo
pay
me
up
this
winter
i
should
like
to
trade
with
your
friend
who
is
he
says
he
is
the
member
for
isle
sable
county
and
if
he
do
let
the
great
folks
have
it
it
a
pity
do
you
call
great
folks
said
i
i
vow
i
hav
seed
one
since
i
came
here
the
only
one
that
i
know
that
comes
near
hand
to
one
is
nicholas
overknocker
that
lives
all
along
shore
about
margaret
bay
and
he
is
a
great
man
it
takes
a
yoke
of
oxen
to
drag
him
when
i
first
seed
him
says
i
what
on
airth
is
the
matter
o
that
man
has
he
the
dropsy
for
he
is
actilly
the
greatest
man
i
ever
seed
he
must
weigh
the
matter
of
five
hundred
weight
he
cut
three
inches
on
the
rib
he
must
have
a
proper
sight
of
lard
that
chap
no
says
i
call
great
men
for
there
ai
a
great
man
in
the
country
that
a
fact
there
ai
one
that
desarves
the
name
folks
will
only
larf
at
you
if
you
talk
that
way
there
may
be
some
rich
men
and
i
believe
there
be
and
it
a
pity
there
war
more
on
and
a
still
greater
pity
they
have
so
little
spirit
or
enterprise
among
but
a
country
is
none
the
worse
of
having
rich
men
in
it
you
may
depend
great
folks
well
come
that
a
good
joke
that
bangs
the
bush
no
my
friend
says
i
meat
that
at
the
top
of
the
barrel
is
sometimes
not
so
good
as
that
that
a
little
further
down
the
upper
and
lower
eends
are
plaguy
apt
to
have
a
little
taint
in
but
the
middle
is
always
good
says
the
bluenose
they
bea
great
men
exactly
in
that
sense
but
they
are
great
men
compared
to
us
poor
folks
and
they
eat
up
all
the
revenue
there
nothin
left
for
roads
and
bridges
they
want
to
ruin
the
country
that
a
fact
to
ruin
your
granny
says
i
for
it
raised
my
dander
to
hear
the
critter
talk
such
nonsense
i
did
hear
of
one
chap
says
i
sot
fire
to
his
own
house
once
up
to
squantum
but
the
cunnin
rascal
insured
it
first
now
how
can
your
great
folks
ruin
the
country
without
ruinin
themselves
unless
they
have
insured
the
province
our
folks
will
insure
all
creation
for
half
nothin
but
i
never
heerd
tell
of
a
country
being
insured
agin
rich
men
now
if
you
ever
go
to
wall
street
to
get
such
a
policy
leave
the
door
open
behind
you
all
or
they
grab
right
hold
of
you
shave
your
head
and
blister
it
clap
a
straight
jacket
on
you
and
whip
you
right
into
a
mad
house
afore
you
can
say
jack
robinson
no
your
great
men
are
nothin
but
rich
men
and
i
can
tell
you
for
your
comfort
nothin
to
hinder
you
from
bein
rich
too
if
you
will
take
the
same
means
as
they
did
they
were
once
all
as
poor
folks
as
you
be
or
their
fathers
afore
them
for
i
know
their
whole
breed
seed
and
generation
and
they
would
thank
you
to
tell
them
that
you
knew
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
i
tell
you
if
ever
you
want
the
loan
of
a
hundred
pounds
from
any
of
them
keep
dark
about
that
see
as
far
ahead
as
you
please
but
it
ai
always
pleasant
to
have
folks
see
too
far
back
perhaps
they
be
a
little
proud
or
so
but
nateral
all
folks
that
grow
up
right
off
like
a
mushroom
in
one
night
are
apt
to
think
no
small
beer
of
themselves
a
cabbage
has
plaguy
large
leaves
to
the
bottom
and
spreads
them
out
as
wide
as
an
old
woman
petticoats
to
hide
the
ground
it
sprung
from
and
conceal
its
extraction
but
what
that
to
you
if
they
get
too
large
salaries
dock
down
at
once
but
do
keep
talkin
about
it
for
everlastinly
if
you
have
too
many
sarvents
pay
some
on
off
or
when
they
quit
your
sarvice
do
hire
others
in
their
room
all
but
you
miss
your
mark
when
you
keep
firin
away
at
bankers
lawyers
and
public
officers
the
whole
blessed
time
that
way
went
out
once
when
i
was
a
boy
and
father
went
along
with
me
to
teach
me
well
the
first
flock
of
plover
i
seed
i
let
slip
at
and
missed
says
father
says
he
what
a
blockhead
you
be
sam
that
your
own
fault
they
were
too
far
off
you
ought
to
have
fired
so
soon
at
bunker
hill
we
let
the
british
come
right
on
till
we
seed
the
whites
of
their
eyes
and
then
we
let
have
it
slap
bang
well
i
felt
kinder
grigged
at
missin
my
shot
and
i
did
over
half
like
to
be
scolded
too
so
says
i
yes
father
but
recollect
you
had
a
mud
bank
to
hide
behind
where
you
were
proper
safe
and
you
had
a
rest
for
your
guns
too
but
as
soon
as
you
seed
a
little
more
than
the
whites
of
their
eyes
you
run
for
dear
life
full
split
and
so
i
do
see
much
to
brag
on
in
that
arter
all
so
come
now
i
teach
you
to
talk
that
way
you
puppy
you
said
he
of
that
glorious
day
and
he
fetched
me
a
wipe
that
i
do
believe
if
i
had
a
dodged
would
have
spoiled
my
gunnin
for
that
hitch
so
i
gave
him
a
wide
birth
arter
that
all
day
well
the
next
time
i
missed
says
i
she
hung
fire
so
everlastinly
it
no
wonder
and
the
next
miss
says
i
the
powder
is
no
good
i
vow
well
i
missed
every
shot
and
i
had
an
excuse
for
every
one
on
the
flint
was
bad
or
she
flashed
in
the
pan
or
the
shot
scaled
or
something
or
another
and
when
all
would
do
i
swore
the
gun
was
no
good
at
all
now
says
father
and
he
edged
up
all
the
time
to
pay
me
off
for
that
hit
at
his
bunker
hill
story
which
was
the
only
shot
i
did
miss
you
hai
got
the
right
reason
arter
all
it
was
your
own
fault
sam
that
jist
the
case
with
you
you
may
blame
banks
and
council
and
house
of
assembly
and
the
great
men
till
you
are
tired
but
it
all
your
own
fault
you
no
spirit
and
no
enterprise
you
want
industry
and
economy
use
them
and
you
soon
be
as
rich
as
the
people
at
halifax
you
call
great
folks
they
did
grow
rich
by
talkin
but
by
workin
instead
of
lookin
after
other
business
they
looked
about
the
keenest
arter
their
own
you
are
like
the
machinery
of
one
of
our
boats
good
enough
and
strong
enough
but
of
no
airthly
use
till
you
get
the
steam
up
you
want
to
be
set
in
motion
and
then
you
go
ahead
like
anything
you
may
depend
give
up
politics
it
a
barren
field
and
well
watched
too
when
one
critter
jumps
a
fence
into
a
good
field
and
gets
fat
more
nor
twenty
are
chased
round
and
round
by
a
whole
pack
of
yelpin
curs
till
they
are
fairly
beat
out
and
eend
by
bein
and
are
at
the
liftin
at
last
look
to
your
farms
your
water
powers
your
fisheries
and
factories
in
short
says
i
puttin
on
my
hat
and
startin
to
yourselves
and
do
look
to
others
no
xxii
a
cure
for
conceit
it
a
most
curious
unaccountable
thing
but
it
a
fact
said
the
clockmaker
the
bluenoses
are
so
conceited
they
think
they
know
everything
and
yet
there
ai
a
livin
soul
in
nova
scotia
knows
his
own
business
real
complete
farmer
or
fisherman
lawyer
or
doctor
or
any
other
folk
a
farmer
said
to
me
one
day
up
to
pugnose
inn
at
river
philip
slick
says
he
allot
this
ai
a
bread
country
i
intend
to
sell
off
the
house
i
improve
and
go
to
the
states
it
ai
a
bread
country
said
i
never
seed
one
that
was
there
is
more
bread
used
here
made
of
best
superfine
flour
and
no
genesssee
than
in
any
other
place
of
the
same
population
in
the
univarse
you
might
as
well
say
it
ai
a
clock
country
when
to
my
sartin
knowledge
there
are
more
clocks
than
bibles
in
it
i
guess
you
expect
to
raise
your
bread
ready
made
do
you
well
there
only
one
class
of
our
free
and
enlightened
citizens
that
can
do
that
and
that
them
that
are
born
with
silver
spoons
in
their
mouths
it
a
pity
you
was
availed
of
this
truth
afore
you
up
killoch
and
off
take
my
advice
and
bide
where
you
be
well
the
fishermen
are
jist
as
bad
the
next
time
you
go
into
the
fish
market
at
halifax
stump
some
of
the
old
hands
says
you
many
fins
has
a
cod
at
a
word
and
i
liquidate
the
bet
if
you
lose
it
when
i
been
afore
now
of
my
clocks
and
they
began
to
raise
my
dander
by
belittleing
the
yankees
i
always
brought
them
up
by
a
round
turn
by
that
requirement
many
fins
has
a
cod
at
a
word
well
they
never
could
answer
it
and
then
says
i
you
larn
your
own
business
i
guess
it
will
be
time
enough
to
teach
other
folks
how
different
it
is
with
our
men
folk
if
they
ca
get
through
a
question
how
beautifully
they
can
go
round
it
ca
they
never
stops
them
i
had
two
brothers
josiah
and
eldad
one
was
a
lawyer
and
the
other
a
doctor
they
were
about
their
examinations
one
night
at
a
huskin
frolic
up
to
governor
big
stone
barn
at
slickville
says
josy
i
was
examined
the
judge
axed
me
all
about
real
estate
and
says
he
josiah
says
he
what
a
fee
why
says
i
judge
it
depends
on
the
natur
of
the
case
in
a
common
one
says
i
i
call
six
dollars
a
pretty
fair
one
but
lawyer
webster
has
got
afore
now
i
heerd
tell
one
thousand
dollars
and
that
i
do
call
a
fee
well
the
judge
he
larfed
ready
to
split
his
sides
thinks
i
old
chap
you
bust
like
a
steam
if
you
hai
got
a
safety
valve
somewhere
or
another
and
says
he
i
vow
that
superfine
i
indorse
your
certificate
for
you
young
man
there
no
fear
of
you
you
pass
the
inspection
brand
anyhow
says
eldad
hope
i
may
be
skinned
if
the
same
thing
did
happen
to
me
at
my
examination
they
axed
me
a
sight
of
questions
some
on
i
could
answer
and
some
on
no
soul
could
right
off
the
reel
at
a
word
without
a
little
cipherin
at
last
they
axed
me
how
would
you
calculate
to
put
a
patient
into
a
sweat
when
common
modes
would
work
no
how
why
says
i
i
do
as
dr
comfort
payne
sarved
father
and
how
was
that
said
they
why
says
i
he
put
him
into
such
a
sweat
as
i
never
seed
him
in
afore
in
all
my
born
days
since
i
was
raised
by
sending
him
in
his
bill
and
if
that
did
sweat
him
it
a
pity
it
was
an
active
dose
you
may
depend
i
guess
that
chap
has
cut
his
said
the
president
let
him
pass
as
approbated
they
both
knowed
well
enough
they
only
made
as
if
they
did
to
poke
a
little
fun
at
them
for
the
slick
family
were
counted
in
a
general
way
to
be
pretty
considerable
cute
they
reckon
themselves
here
a
chalk
above
us
yankees
but
i
guess
they
have
a
wrinkle
or
two
to
grow
afore
they
progress
ahead
on
us
yet
if
they
hai
got
a
full
cargo
of
conceit
here
then
i
never
seed
a
load
that
all
they
have
the
hold
chock
full
deck
piled
up
to
the
pump
handles
and
scuppers
under
water
they
larnt
that
of
the
british
who
are
actilly
so
full
of
it
they
remind
me
of
commodore
trip
when
he
was
about
he
thought
everybody
drunk
but
himself
i
never
liked
the
last
war
i
thought
it
unnateral
and
that
we
had
ought
to
have
taken
hold
of
it
at
all
and
so
most
of
our
new
england
folks
thought
and
i
was
sorry
to
hear
gineral
dearborne
was
beat
seein
we
had
no
call
to
go
into
canada
but
when
the
guerriere
was
captivated
by
our
old
ironsides
the
constitution
i
did
feel
lifted
up
amost
as
high
as
a
stalk
of
varginny
corn
among
connecticut
middlins
i
grew
two
inches
taller
i
vow
the
night
i
heerd
that
news
brag
says
i
is
a
good
dog
but
holdfast
is
better
the
british
navals
had
been
and
so
long
that
when
they
landed
in
our
cities
they
swaggered
as
much
as
uncle
peleg
big
peleg
as
he
was
called
and
when
he
walked
up
the
centre
of
one
of
our
narrow
boston
streets
he
used
to
swing
his
arms
on
each
side
of
him
so
that
folks
had
to
clear
out
of
both
foot
paths
he
cut
afore
now
the
fingers
of
both
hands
agin
the
shop
windows
on
each
side
of
the
street
many
the
poor
feller
crupper
bone
he
smashed
with
his
great
thick
boots
out
his
feet
afore
him
out
of
sight
when
he
was
in
full
rig
away
at
the
top
of
his
gait
well
they
cut
as
many
shines
as
uncle
peleg
one
frigate
they
guessed
would
captivate
sink
or
burn
our
whole
navy
says
a
naval
one
day
to
the
skipper
of
a
fishing
boat
that
he
took
says
he
it
true
commodore
sword
is
made
of
an
old
iron
hoop
says
the
skipper
not
quite
certified
as
to
that
seein
as
i
never
sot
eyes
on
it
but
i
guess
if
he
gets
a
chance
he
show
you
the
temper
of
it
some
of
these
days
anyhow
i
mind
once
a
british
took
one
of
our
boston
vessels
and
ordered
all
hands
on
board
and
sent
a
party
to
skuttle
her
well
they
skuttled
the
fowls
and
the
old
particular
genuine
rum
but
they
obliviated
their
arrand
and
left
her
well
next
day
another
frigate
for
they
were
as
thick
as
toads
arter
a
rain
comes
near
her
and
fires
a
shot
for
her
to
bring
to
no
answer
was
made
there
bein
no
livin
soul
on
board
and
another
shot
fired
still
no
answer
what
on
airth
is
the
meanin
of
this
said
the
captain
they
haul
down
that
damn
goose
and
gridiron
that
what
he
called
our
eagle
and
stars
on
the
flag
says
the
first
leftenant
guess
they
are
all
dead
men
that
shot
frightened
them
to
death
are
afeared
to
show
their
noses
says
another
they
should
be
shaved
off
by
our
shots
are
all
down
below
their
loss
i
guess
says
a
third
take
my
davy
says
the
captain
some
yankee
trick
a
torpedo
in
her
bottom
or
some
such
trap
we
let
her
be
and
sure
enough
next
day
back
she
came
to
shore
of
herself
give
you
a
quarter
of
an
hour
says
the
captain
of
the
guerriere
to
his
men
take
that
yankee
frigate
the
constitution
i
guess
he
found
his
mistake
where
he
did
expect
it
without
any
great
sarch
for
it
either
yes
to
eventuate
my
story
it
did
me
good
i
felt
dreadful
nice
i
promise
you
it
was
as
lovely
as
bitters
of
a
cold
mornin
our
folks
beat
arter
that
so
often
they
got
a
little
grain
too
much
conceit
also
they
got
their
heels
too
high
for
their
boots
and
began
to
walk
like
uncle
peleg
too
so
that
when
the
chesapeake
got
whipped
i
war
sorry
we
could
spare
that
one
and
it
made
our
navals
look
round
like
a
feller
who
gets
a
hoist
to
see
at
him
it
made
brush
the
dust
off
and
walk
on
rather
sheepish
it
cut
their
combs
that
a
fact
the
war
did
us
a
plaguy
sight
of
good
in
more
ways
than
one
and
it
did
the
british
some
good
too
it
taught
not
to
carry
their
chins
too
high
for
fear
they
should
see
the
gutters
a
mistake
that
spoiled
many
a
bran
new
coat
and
trousers
afore
now
well
these
bluenoses
have
caught
this
disease
as
folks
do
the
scotch
fiddle
by
shakin
hands
along
with
the
british
conceit
has
become
here
as
doctor
rush
says
you
have
heerd
tell
of
him
the
first
man
of
the
age
and
it
generally
allowed
our
doctors
take
the
shine
off
of
all
the
world
acclimated
it
is
citizenized
among
and
the
only
cure
is
a
real
good
quiltin
i
met
a
first
chop
colchester
gag
this
summer
to
the
races
to
halifax
and
he
knowed
as
much
about
racin
i
do
suppose
as
a
choctaw
ingian
does
of
a
railroad
well
he
was
of
his
horse
and
on
like
statiee
he
was
begot
he
said
by
roncesvalles
which
was
better
than
any
horse
that
ever
was
seen
because
he
was
once
in
a
duke
stable
in
england
it
was
only
a
man
that
had
blood
like
a
lord
said
he
that
knew
what
blood
in
a
horse
was
captain
currycomb
an
officer
at
halifax
had
seen
his
horse
and
praised
him
and
that
was
enough
that
stamped
him
that
fixed
his
value
it
was
like
the
president
name
to
a
bank
note
it
makes
it
pass
current
says
i
hai
got
a
drop
of
blood
in
me
nothin
stronger
than
molasses
and
water
i
vow
but
i
guess
i
know
a
horse
when
i
see
him
for
all
that
and
i
do
think
any
great
shakes
of
your
beast
anyhow
what
start
will
you
give
me
says
i
i
will
run
old
clay
agin
you
for
a
mile
lick
right
an
eend
rods
said
he
twenty
dollars
well
we
run
and
i
made
old
clay
bite
in
his
breath
and
only
beat
him
by
half
a
neck
tight
scratch
says
i
and
it
would
have
sarved
me
right
if
i
had
been
beat
i
had
no
business
to
run
an
old
roadster
so
everlastin
fast
it
ai
fair
on
him
is
it
says
he
will
double
the
bet
and
start
even
and
run
you
agin
if
you
dare
says
i
i
won
the
last
it
would
be
pretty
not
to
give
you
a
chance
i
do
suppose
i
to
refuse
but
i
do
love
to
abuse
my
beast
by
knockin
him
about
this
way
as
soon
as
the
money
was
staked
i
said
we
better
says
i
stakes
that
blood
horse
of
has
such
uncommon
particular
bottom
he
perhaps
leave
me
clean
out
of
sight
fear
of
that
said
he
larfin
he
beat
you
easy
anyhow
no
flinchin
says
he
not
let
you
go
back
of
the
bargain
run
or
forfeit
says
i
there
is
fear
of
it
your
horse
will
leave
me
out
of
sight
to
a
sartainty
that
a
fact
for
he
ca
keep
up
to
me
no
time
i
drop
him
hull
down
in
tu
tu
if
old
clay
did
make
a
fool
of
him
it
a
pity
he
gallop
pretty
that
all
he
walked
away
from
him
jist
as
the
chancellor
livingston
steamboat
passes
a
sloop
at
anchor
in
the
north
river
says
i
told
you
your
horse
would
beat
me
clean
out
of
sight
but
you
would
believe
me
now
says
i
will
tell
you
something
else
that
horse
will
help
you
to
lose
more
money
to
halifax
than
you
are
on
for
there
ai
a
beast
gone
down
there
that
wo
beat
him
he
ca
run
a
bit
and
you
may
tell
the
british
captain
i
say
so
take
him
home
and
sell
him
buy
a
good
yoke
of
oxen
they
are
fast
enough
for
a
farmer
and
give
up
blood
horses
to
them
that
can
afford
to
keep
stable
helps
to
tend
and
leave
bettin
alone
to
them
as
has
more
money
nor
wit
and
can
afford
to
lose
their
cash
without
thinkin
agin
of
their
loss
i
want
your
advice
said
he
will
ask
it
most
peskily
sulky
might
have
got
it
before
you
axed
for
it
said
i
not
afore
you
wanted
it
you
may
depend
on
it
but
stop
said
i
see
that
all
right
afore
we
part
so
i
counts
over
the
fifteen
pounds
i
won
of
him
note
by
note
as
slow
as
anything
on
purpose
to
rile
him
then
i
mounts
old
clay
agin
and
says
i
you
have
considerably
the
advantage
of
me
this
hitch
anyhow
says
he
that
says
i
guess
you
return
rather
lighter
than
you
came
and
that
more
nor
i
can
say
anyhow
and
then
i
gave
him
a
wink
and
a
jupe
of
the
head
as
much
as
to
say
you
take
and
rode
on
and
left
him
starin
and
scratchin
his
head
like
a
feller
who
lost
his
road
if
that
citizen
ai
a
born
fool
or
too
far
gone
in
the
disease
depend
o
he
found
cure
for
conceit
no
xxiii
the
blowin
time
the
long
rambling
dissertation
on
conceit
to
which
i
had
just
listened
from
the
clockmaker
forcibly
reminded
me
of
the
celebrated
aphorism
gnothi
seauton
know
thyself
which
both
from
its
great
antiquity
and
wisdom
has
been
by
many
attributed
to
an
oracle
with
all
his
shrewdness
to
discover
and
his
humour
to
ridicule
the
foibles
of
others
slick
was
kind
to
the
many
defects
of
his
own
character
and
while
prescribing
a
cure
for
conceit
exhibited
in
all
he
said
and
all
he
did
the
most
overweening
conceit
himself
he
never
spoke
of
his
own
countrymen
without
calling
them
the
most
free
and
enlightened
citizens
on
the
face
of
the
airth
or
as
takin
the
shine
off
of
all
creation
his
country
he
boasted
to
be
the
best
atween
the
poles
the
greatest
glory
under
heaven
the
yankees
he
considered
to
use
his
expression
as
actilly
the
in
knowledge
among
all
the
americans
and
boasted
that
they
have
not
only
gone
ahead
of
all
others
but
had
lately
arrived
at
that
most
enviable
ne
plus
ultra
point
goin
ahead
of
themselves
in
short
he
entertained
no
doubt
that
slickville
was
the
finest
place
in
the
greatest
nation
in
the
world
and
the
slick
family
the
wisest
family
in
it
i
was
about
calling
his
attention
to
this
national
trait
when
i
saw
him
draw
his
reins
under
his
foot
a
mode
of
driving
peculiar
to
himself
when
he
wished
to
economize
the
time
that
would
otherwise
be
lost
by
an
unnecessary
delay
and
taking
off
his
hat
which
like
a
peddler
pack
contained
a
general
assortment
select
from
a
number
of
loose
cigars
one
that
appeared
likely
to
go
as
he
called
it
having
lighted
it
by
a
lucifer
and
ascertained
that
it
was
true
in
draft
he
resumed
his
reins
and
remarked
this
must
be
an
everlastin
fine
country
beyond
all
doubt
for
the
folks
have
nothin
to
do
but
to
ride
about
and
talk
politics
in
winter
when
the
ground
is
covered
with
snow
what
grand
times
they
have
over
these
here
marshes
with
the
gals
or
ball
on
the
ice
or
goin
to
quiltin
frolics
of
nice
long
winter
evenings
and
then
home
like
mad
by
moonlight
meant
that
season
on
purpose
for
courtin
a
little
tidy
scrumptious
lookin
sleigh
a
real
clipper
of
a
horse
a
string
of
bells
as
long
as
a
string
of
inions
round
his
neck
and
a
sprig
on
his
back
lookin
for
all
the
world
like
a
bunch
of
apples
broke
off
at
gatherin
time
and
a
sweetheart
alongside
all
muffled
up
but
her
eyes
and
lips
the
one
lookin
right
into
you
and
the
other
talkin
right
at
you
is
enough
to
drive
one
ravin
distracted
mad
with
pleasure
ai
it
and
then
the
dear
critters
say
the
bells
make
such
a
din
there
no
hearin
one
self
speak
so
they
put
their
pretty
little
mugs
close
up
to
your
face
and
talk
talk
talk
till
one
ca
help
lookin
right
at
them
instead
of
the
horse
and
then
whap
you
both
go
capsized
into
a
snowdrift
together
skins
cushions
and
all
and
then
to
see
the
little
critter
shake
herself
when
she
gets
up
like
a
duck
landin
from
a
pond
away
all
the
time
like
a
canary
bird
and
you
a
with
pleasure
is
fun
alive
you
may
depend
in
this
way
bluenose
gets
led
on
to
offer
himself
as
a
lovier
afore
he
knows
where
he
bees
but
when
he
gets
married
he
recovers
his
eyesight
in
little
less
than
half
no
time
he
soon
finds
he
treed
his
flint
is
fixed
then
you
may
depend
she
larns
him
how
vinegar
is
made
plenty
of
sugar
into
the
water
aforehand
my
dear
says
she
you
want
to
make
it
real
sharp
the
larf
is
on
the
other
side
of
his
mouth
then
if
his
sleigh
gets
upsot
it
no
longer
a
funny
matter
i
tell
you
he
catches
it
right
and
left
her
eyes
do
look
right
up
to
any
more
nor
her
little
tongue
ring
ring
ring
like
a
bell
any
longer
but
a
great
big
hood
covers
her
head
and
a
whappin
great
muff
covers
her
face
and
she
looks
like
a
bag
of
soiled
clothes
to
the
brook
to
be
washed
when
they
get
out
she
do
wait
any
more
for
him
to
walk
lock
and
lock
with
her
but
they
march
like
a
horse
and
a
cow
to
water
one
in
each
gutter
if
there
ai
a
transmogrification
it
a
pity
the
difference
atween
a
wife
and
a
sweetheart
is
near
about
as
great
as
there
is
between
new
and
hard
cider
a
man
never
tires
of
puttin
one
to
his
lips
but
makes
plaguy
wry
faces
at
it
makes
me
so
kinder
wamblecropt
when
i
think
on
it
that
i
afeared
to
venture
on
matrimony
at
all
i
have
seen
some
bluenoses
most
properly
bit
you
may
depend
you
seen
a
boy
on
a
most
beautiful
smooth
bit
of
ice
hai
you
larfin
and
hoopin
and
hallooin
like
one
possessed
when
presently
sowse
he
goes
in
over
head
and
ears
how
he
outs
fins
and
flops
about
and
blows
like
a
porpoise
properly
frightened
do
he
and
when
he
gets
out
there
he
stands
all
shiverin
and
shakin
and
the
water
a
in
his
shoes
and
his
trousers
all
to
his
legs
well
he
sneaks
off
home
lookin
like
a
fool
and
thinkin
everybody
he
meets
is
at
him
many
folks
here
are
like
that
boy
afore
they
have
been
six
months
married
they
be
proper
glad
to
get
out
of
the
scrape
too
and
sneak
off
if
they
could
that
a
fact
the
marriage
yoke
is
plaguy
apt
to
gall
the
neck
as
the
ash
bow
does
the
ox
in
rainy
weather
unless
it
be
most
particularly
well
fitted
you
seen
a
yoke
of
cattle
that
war
properly
mated
they
spend
more
strength
in
pullin
agin
each
other
than
in
pullin
the
load
well
that
apt
to
be
the
case
with
them
as
choose
their
wives
in
sleighin
parties
quiltin
frolics
and
so
on
instead
of
the
dairies
looms
and
now
the
bluenoses
are
all
in
winter
the
young
folks
drive
out
the
gals
and
talk
love
and
all
sorts
of
things
as
sweet
as
doughnuts
the
old
folks
find
it
near
about
as
well
to
leave
the
old
women
to
home
for
fear
they
should
keep
tune
together
so
they
drive
out
alone
to
chat
about
house
of
assembly
with
their
neighbours
while
the
boys
and
hired
helps
do
the
chores
when
the
spring
comes
and
the
fields
are
dry
enough
to
be
sowed
they
all
have
to
be
ploughed
fall
rains
wash
the
lands
too
much
for
fall
ploughin
well
the
ploughs
have
to
be
mended
and
sharpened
what
the
use
of
doin
that
afore
it
wanted
well
the
wheat
gets
in
too
late
and
then
comes
rust
but
whose
fault
is
that
why
the
climate
to
be
sure
for
nova
scotia
ai
a
bread
country
when
a
man
has
to
run
ever
so
far
as
fast
as
he
can
clip
he
has
to
stop
and
take
breath
you
must
do
that
or
choke
so
it
is
with
a
horse
run
him
a
mile
and
his
flanks
will
heave
like
a
bellows
you
must
slack
up
the
rein
and
give
him
a
little
wind
or
he
fall
right
down
with
you
it
stands
to
reason
do
it
atwixt
spring
and
fall
work
is
time
then
courts
come
on
and
grand
jury
business
and
militia
trainin
and
race
trainin
and
what
not
and
a
fine
spell
of
ridin
about
and
doin
nothin
a
real
time
then
comes
harvest
and
that
is
proper
hard
work
mowin
and
pitchin
hay
and
reapin
and
bindin
grain
and
potato
diggin
that
as
hard
as
sole
leather
afore
it
hammered
on
the
lap
stone
it
next
to
anything
it
takes
a
feller
as
tough
as
old
hickory
general
jackson
to
stand
that
ohio
is
the
only
country
i
knew
of
where
folks
are
saved
that
trouble
and
there
the
freshets
come
jist
in
the
nick
of
time
for
and
sweep
all
the
crops
right
up
in
a
heap
for
and
they
have
nothin
to
do
but
take
it
home
and
house
it
and
sometimes
a
man
gets
more
than
his
own
crop
and
finds
a
proper
swad
of
it
all
ready
piled
up
only
a
little
wet
or
so
but
all
countries
ai
like
ohio
well
arter
harvest
comes
fall
and
then
there
a
grand
time
till
spring
now
how
the
lord
the
bluenoses
can
complain
of
their
country
when
it
only
one
third
work
and
time
no
soul
can
tell
father
used
to
say
when
i
lived
on
the
farm
along
with
him
says
he
vow
i
wish
there
was
jist
four
hundred
days
in
the
year
for
it
a
plaguy
sight
too
short
for
me
i
can
find
as
much
work
as
all
hands
on
us
can
do
for
three
hundred
and
days
and
jist
days
more
if
we
had
we
hai
got
a
minit
to
spare
you
must
shell
the
corn
and
winner
the
grain
at
night
and
clean
all
up
slick
or
i
guess
we
fall
astarn
as
sure
as
the
lord
made
moses
if
he
did
keep
us
all
at
it
away
full
chisel
the
whole
blessed
time
it
a
pity
there
was
no
time
there
you
may
depend
we
ploughed
all
the
fall
for
dear
life
in
winter
we
thrashed
made
and
mended
tools
went
to
market
and
mill
and
got
out
our
firewood
and
rails
as
soon
as
frost
was
gone
came
sowin
and
plantin
weedin
and
hoein
then
harvest
and
spreadin
compost
then
gatherin
manure
fencin
and
ditchin
and
then
turn
tu
and
fall
ploughin
agin
it
all
went
round
like
a
wheel
without
stoppin
and
so
fast
i
guess
you
could
see
the
spokes
just
one
long
everlastin
stroke
from
july
to
etarnity
without
time
to
look
back
on
the
tracks
instead
of
racin
over
the
country
like
a
young
doctor
to
show
how
busy
a
man
is
that
has
nothin
to
do
as
bluenose
does
and
then
take
a
time
we
kept
a
rale
travellin
gait
an
pace
the
whole
year
round
they
buy
more
nor
they
sell
and
eat
more
than
they
raise
in
this
country
what
a
pretty
way
that
is
is
it
if
the
critters
knew
how
to
cipher
they
would
soon
find
out
that
a
sum
stated
that
way
always
eends
in
a
naught
i
never
knew
it
to
fail
and
i
defy
any
soul
to
cipher
it
so
as
to
make
it
come
out
any
other
way
either
by
schoolmaster
assistant
or
algebra
when
i
was
a
boy
the
slickville
bank
broke
and
an
awful
disorderment
it
made
that
a
fact
else
was
talked
of
well
i
studied
it
over
a
long
time
but
i
could
make
it
out
so
says
i
how
came
that
bank
to
break
war
it
well
built
i
thought
that
quincy
granite
was
so
amazin
strong
all
natur
would
break
it
you
foolish
critter
says
he
ai
the
buildin
that
broke
it
the
consarn
that
smashed
says
i
know
folks
are
plaguilly
consarned
about
it
but
what
do
you
call
folks
smashin
their
consarns
father
he
larfed
out
like
anything
i
thought
he
never
would
stop
and
sister
sall
got
right
up
and
walked
out
of
the
room
as
mad
as
a
hatter
says
she
i
do
believe
you
are
a
born
fool
i
vow
when
father
had
done
larfin
says
he
tell
you
sam
how
it
was
they
ciphered
it
so
that
they
brought
out
nothin
for
a
remainder
says
i
thought
there
was
no
eend
to
their
puss
i
thought
it
was
like
uncle
peleg
musquash
hole
and
that
no
soul
could
ever
find
the
bottom
of
my
says
i
says
he
bank
spent
and
lost
more
money
than
it
made
and
when
folks
do
that
they
must
smash
at
last
if
their
puss
be
as
long
as
the
national
one
of
uncle
sam
this
province
is
like
that
bank
of
it
goin
the
same
road
and
they
find
the
little
eend
of
the
horn
afore
they
think
they
are
halfway
down
to
it
if
folks
would
only
give
over
talkin
about
that
everlastin
house
of
assembly
and
council
and
see
to
their
farms
it
would
be
better
for
i
guess
for
arter
all
what
is
it
why
it
only
a
sort
of
first
chop
grand
jury
and
nothin
else
it
no
more
like
congress
or
parliament
than
marm
pugwash
keepin
room
is
like
our
state
hall
it
jist
nothin
congress
makes
war
and
peace
has
a
say
in
all
treaties
confarms
all
great
nominations
of
the
president
regilates
the
army
and
navy
governs
independent
states
and
snaps
its
fingers
in
the
face
of
all
the
nations
of
europe
as
much
as
to
say
who
be
you
i
allot
i
am
as
big
as
you
be
if
you
are
six
foot
high
i
am
six
foot
six
in
my
stockin
feet
by
gum
and
can
lambaste
any
two
on
you
in
no
time
the
british
can
whip
all
the
world
and
we
can
whip
the
british
but
this
little
house
of
assembly
that
folks
make
such
a
touss
about
what
is
it
why
jist
a
decent
grand
jury
they
make
their
presentments
of
little
money
votes
to
mend
these
everlastin
rottin
little
wooden
bridges
to
throw
a
poultice
of
mud
once
a
year
on
the
roads
and
then
take
a
time
of
three
months
and
go
home
the
littler
folks
be
the
bigger
they
talk
you
never
seed
a
small
man
that
did
wear
high
heel
boots
and
a
hat
and
that
war
ready
to
fight
most
any
one
to
show
he
was
a
man
every
inch
of
him
i
met
a
member
the
other
day
who
swaggered
near
about
as
large
as
uncle
peleg
he
looked
as
if
he
thought
you
could
find
his
anywhere
he
used
some
most
particular
educational
words
genuine
he
put
me
in
mind
of
a
squirrel
i
once
shot
in
our
wood
location
the
little
critter
got
a
hickory
nut
in
his
mouth
well
he
found
it
too
hard
to
crack
and
too
big
to
swaller
and
for
the
life
and
soul
of
him
he
could
spit
it
out
agin
if
he
did
look
like
a
proper
fool
you
may
depend
we
had
a
pond
back
of
our
barn
about
the
bigness
of
a
good
sizeable
and
it
was
chock
full
of
frogs
well
one
of
these
little
critters
fancied
himself
a
and
he
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
took
a
real
time
of
it
he
roared
away
like
thunder
at
last
he
puffed
and
puffed
out
till
he
bust
like
a
if
i
see
the
speaker
this
winter
and
i
shall
see
him
to
a
sartainty
if
they
do
send
for
him
to
london
to
teach
their
new
speaker
and
he
up
to
snuff
that
man
he
knows
how
to
cipher
i
jist
say
to
him
says
i
any
of
your
folks
in
the
house
go
to
swell
out
like
dropsy
give
a
hint
in
time
says
you
you
have
are
a
little
safety
valve
about
you
let
off
a
little
steam
now
and
then
or
you
go
for
it
recollect
the
clockmaker
story
of
the
time
no
xxiv
father
john
tomorrow
will
be
sabbath
day
said
the
clockmaker
i
guess
bide
where
we
be
till
monday
i
like
a
sabbath
in
the
country
all
natur
seems
at
rest
there
a
cheerfulness
in
the
day
here
you
do
find
in
towns
you
have
natur
before
you
here
and
nothin
but
art
there
the
deathy
stillness
of
a
town
and
the
barred
windows
and
shut
shops
and
empty
streets
and
great
long
lines
of
big
brick
buildin
look
melancholy
it
seems
as
if
life
had
ceased
tickin
but
there
had
been
time
for
decay
to
take
hold
on
there
as
if
day
had
broke
but
man
slept
i
ca
describe
exactly
what
i
mean
but
i
always
feel
kinder
gloomy
and
wamblecropt
there
now
in
the
country
it
jist
what
it
ought
to
be
a
day
of
rest
for
man
and
beast
from
labour
when
a
man
rises
on
the
sabbath
and
looks
out
on
the
sunny
fields
and
wavin
crops
his
heart
feels
proper
grateful
and
he
says
come
this
is
a
splendid
day
ai
it
get
ready
and
put
on
our
bettermost
close
and
go
to
meetin
his
first
thought
is
prayerfully
to
render
thanks
and
then
when
he
goes
to
worship
he
meets
all
his
neighbours
and
he
knows
them
all
and
they
are
glad
to
see
each
other
and
if
any
two
on
hai
exactly
gee
together
durin
the
week
why
they
meet
on
kind
of
neutral
ground
and
the
minister
or
neighbours
make
peace
atween
them
but
it
ai
so
in
towns
you
do
know
no
one
you
meet
there
the
worship
of
neighbours
but
it
the
worship
of
strangers
too
for
neighbours
do
know
nor
care
about
each
other
yes
i
love
a
sabbath
in
the
country
while
uttering
this
soliloquy
he
took
up
a
pamphlet
from
the
table
and
turning
to
the
title
page
said
have
you
ever
seen
this
here
book
on
the
controversy
a
controversy
on
the
subject
of
infant
baptism
this
author
friends
say
it
a
clincher
they
say
he
has
sealed
up
elder
mouth
as
tight
as
a
bottle
no
said
i
i
have
not
i
have
heard
of
it
but
never
read
it
in
my
opinion
the
subject
has
been
exhausted
already
and
admits
of
nothing
new
being
said
upon
it
these
religious
controversies
are
a
serious
injury
to
the
cause
of
true
religion
they
are
deeply
deplored
by
the
good
and
moderate
men
of
all
parties
it
has
already
embraced
several
denominations
in
the
dispute
in
this
province
and
i
hear
the
agitation
has
extended
to
new
brunswick
where
it
will
doubtless
be
renewed
with
equal
zeal
i
am
told
all
the
pamphlets
are
exceptionable
in
point
of
temper
and
this
one
in
particular
which
not
only
ascribes
the
most
unworthy
motives
to
its
antagonist
but
contains
some
very
unjustifiable
and
gratuitous
attacks
upon
other
sects
unconnected
with
the
dispute
the
author
has
injured
his
own
cause
for
an
intemperate
advocate
is
more
dangerous
than
an
open
foe
there
is
no
doubt
on
it
said
the
clockmaker
it
is
as
clear
as
mud
and
you
are
not
the
only
one
that
thinks
so
i
tell
you
about
the
hottest
time
of
the
dispute
i
was
to
halifax
and
who
should
i
meet
but
father
john
a
catholic
priest
i
had
met
him
afore
in
cape
breton
and
had
sold
him
a
clock
well
he
was
it
off
hot
foot
says
i
john
is
that
you
why
what
on
airth
is
the
matter
of
you
what
makes
you
in
such
an
everlastin
hurry
driven
away
like
one
ravin
distracted
mad
sick
visit
says
he
pat
lanigan
him
that
you
mind
to
bradore
lake
well
he
near
about
at
the
of
death
guess
not
said
i
i
jist
heerd
tell
he
was
dead
well
that
brought
him
up
all
standin
and
he
ship
in
a
jiffy
and
walks
a
little
way
with
me
and
we
got
about
this
very
subject
says
he
are
you
mr
slick
well
i
looks
up
to
him
and
winks
clockmaker
says
i
well
he
smiled
and
says
he
see
as
much
as
to
say
i
had
ought
to
have
axed
that
question
at
all
i
guess
for
every
man
religion
is
his
own
and
nobody
business
says
he
know
all
about
this
country
who
do
folks
say
has
the
best
of
the
dispute
says
i
john
it
like
the
battles
up
to
canada
lines
last
war
each
side
claims
victory
i
guess
there
ai
much
to
brag
on
nary
way
damage
done
on
both
sides
and
nothin
gained
as
far
as
i
can
learn
he
stopped
short
and
looked
me
in
the
face
and
says
he
slick
you
are
a
man
that
has
seed
a
good
deal
of
the
world
and
a
considerable
of
an
understandin
man
and
i
guess
i
can
talk
to
you
now
says
he
gracious
sake
do
jist
look
here
and
see
how
you
heretics
protestants
i
mean
says
he
for
i
guess
that
word
slipped
out
without
leave
by
the
ears
away
at
each
other
the
whole
blessed
time
tooth
and
nail
hip
and
thigh
hammer
and
tongs
disputin
revilin
wranglin
and
beloutin
each
other
with
all
sorts
of
ugly
names
that
they
can
lay
their
tongues
to
is
that
the
way
you
love
your
neighbour
as
yourself
we
say
this
is
a
practical
comment
on
schism
and
by
the
powers
of
moll
kelly
said
he
they
all
ought
to
be
well
lambasted
together
the
whole
batch
on
entirely
says
i
john
give
me
your
hand
there
are
some
things
i
guess
you
and
i
do
agree
on
and
most
likely
never
will
seein
that
you
are
a
popish
priest
but
in
that
idee
i
do
opinionate
with
you
and
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
all
the
world
thought
with
us
i
guess
he
did
half
like
that
word
popish
priest
it
seemed
to
grig
him
like
his
face
looked
kinder
riled
like
well
water
arter
a
heavy
rain
and
said
he
slick
says
he
country
is
a
free
country
ai
it
freest
says
i
the
face
of
the
airth
you
ca
ditto
it
nowhere
we
are
as
free
as
the
air
and
when
our
dander
up
stronger
than
any
hurricane
you
ever
seed
tear
up
all
creation
there
ai
the
beat
of
it
to
be
found
anywhere
you
call
this
a
free
country
said
he
considerable
middlin
says
i
that
they
are
under
a
king
says
he
you
were
seen
in
connecticut
hands
along
with
a
popish
priest
as
you
are
pleased
to
call
me
and
he
made
me
a
bow
as
much
as
to
say
mind
your
trumps
the
next
deal
you
now
are
in
the
streets
of
halifax
along
with
me
with
all
your
crackin
and
boastin
of
your
freedom
i
guess
you
would
sell
a
clock
agin
in
that
state
for
one
while
i
tell
you
and
he
bid
me
good
mornin
and
turned
away
john
says
i
ca
stop
says
he
must
see
that
poor
critter
family
they
must
be
in
great
trouble
and
a
sick
visit
is
afore
controvarsy
in
my
creed
says
i
word
with
you
afore
you
go
if
that
name
popish
priest
was
an
ongenteel
one
i
ax
your
pardon
i
did
mean
no
offence
i
do
assure
you
and
i
say
this
for
your
satisfaction
tu
you
the
first
man
in
this
province
that
ever
gave
me
a
real
right
down
complete
checkmate
since
i
first
sot
foot
in
it
i
be
skinned
if
you
ai
yes
said
slick
father
john
was
right
these
antagonizing
chaps
ought
to
be
well
quilted
the
whole
raft
of
it
fairly
makes
me
sick
to
see
the
folks
each
on
up
of
their
own
man
it
agin
says
one
play
says
another
it
into
him
says
a
third
and
your
sort
says
a
fourth
them
are
the
folks
who
do
mischief
they
show
such
clear
grit
it
fairly
frightens
me
it
makes
my
hair
stand
right
up
on
eend
to
see
ministers
do
that
it
appears
to
me
that
i
could
write
a
book
in
favour
of
myself
and
my
notions
without
writin
agin
any
one
and
if
i
could
i
would
write
at
all
i
snore
our
old
minister
hopewell
a
real
good
man
and
a
larned
man
too
that
they
sent
to
him
once
to
write
agin
the
unitarians
for
they
are
ahead
like
statiee
in
new
england
but
he
refused
said
he
says
he
i
first
went
to
cambridge
there
was
a
boxer
and
wrastler
came
there
and
he
beat
every
one
wherever
he
went
well
old
possit
was
the
church
of
england
parson
at
charlestown
at
the
time
and
a
terrible
powerful
man
he
was
a
real
sneezer
and
as
active
as
a
weasel
well
the
boxer
met
him
one
day
a
little
way
out
of
town
of
his
evenin
walk
and
said
he
parson
says
he
they
say
you
are
a
most
a
plaguy
strong
man
and
uncommon
stiff
too
now
says
he
i
never
seed
a
man
yet
that
was
a
match
for
me
would
you
have
any
objection
jist
to
let
me
be
availed
of
your
strength
here
in
a
friendly
way
by
ourselves
where
no
soul
would
be
the
wiser
if
you
will
i
keep
dark
about
it
i
swan
go
your
way
said
the
parson
and
tempt
me
not
you
are
a
wicked
man
and
i
take
no
pleasure
in
such
vain
idle
sports
very
well
said
the
boxer
now
here
i
stand
says
he
in
the
path
right
slap
afore
you
if
you
pass
round
me
then
i
take
it
as
a
sign
that
you
are
afeard
on
me
and
if
you
keep
the
path
why
then
you
must
first
put
me
out
that
a
fact
the
parson
jist
made
a
spring
forrard
and
kitched
him
up
as
quick
as
wink
and
throwed
him
right
over
the
fence
whap
on
the
broad
of
his
back
and
then
walked
on
as
if
nothin
had
happened
as
demure
as
you
please
and
lookin
as
meek
as
if
butter
would
melt
in
his
mouth
stop
said
the
boxer
as
soon
as
he
picked
himself
up
stop
parson
said
he
that
a
good
man
and
jist
chuck
over
my
horse
too
will
you
for
i
swan
i
believe
you
could
do
one
near
about
as
easy
as
my
said
he
if
that
do
bang
the
bush
you
are
another
guess
chap
from
what
i
took
you
to
be
anyhow
said
hopewell
says
he
wo
write
but
if
ary
a
unitarian
crosses
my
path
i
jist
over
the
fence
with
him
in
no
time
as
the
parson
did
the
boxer
for
writin
only
aggravates
your
opponents
and
never
convinces
them
i
never
seed
a
convert
made
by
that
way
yet
but
i
tell
you
what
i
have
seed
a
man
set
his
own
flock
a
doubtin
by
his
own
writin
you
may
happify
your
enemies
cantankerate
your
opponents
and
injure
your
own
cause
by
it
but
i
defy
you
to
sarve
it
these
writers
said
he
me
in
mind
of
that
boxer
pupils
he
would
sometimes
set
two
on
to
spar
well
they
put
on
their
gloves
and
begin
larfin
and
jokin
all
in
good
humour
presently
one
on
would

says
the

that
your
play
off
gloves
and
at
it
and
sure
enough
away
would
fly
their
gloves
and
at
it
they
go
tooth
and
nail
sam
the
misfortin
is
we
are
all
apt
to
think
intended
for
our
neighbours
and
not
for
ourselves
the
poor
all
think
it
made
for
the
rich
look
at
that
dives
they
say
what
an
scrape
he
got
into
by
his
avarice
with
lazarus
and
ai
it
writ
as
plain
as
anything
that
them
folks
will
find
it
as
easy
to
go
to
heaven
as
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
well
then
the
rich
think
it
all
made
for
the
poor
that
they
sha
steal
nor
bear
false
witness
but
shall
be
obedient
to
them
that
in
authority
and
as
for
them
unitarians
and
he
always
got
his
dander
up
when
he
spoke
of
them
there
no
nothin
with
them
says
he
they
get
fairly
stumped
and
you
produce
a
text
that
they
ca
get
over
nor
get
round
why
they
say
it
ai
in
our
varsion
at
all
that
an
interpolation
it
an
invention
of
them
everlastin
monks
there
nothin
left
for
you
to
do
with
them
but
to
sarve
them
as
parson
possit
detailed
the
boxer
lay
right
hold
of
and
chuck
over
the
fence
even
if
they
were
as
big
as
all
out
doors
that
what
our
folks
ought
to
have
done
with
at
first
pitched
clean
out
of
the
state
and
let
go
down
to
nova
scotia
or
some
such
outlandish
place
for
they
ai
fit
to
live
in
no
christian
country
at
all
is
no
way
to
make
converts
the
true
way
is
to
win
you
may
stop
a
man
mouth
sam
says
he
a
book
down
his
throat
but
you
wo
convince
him
it
a
fine
thing
to
write
a
book
all
covered
over
with
latin
and
greek
and
hebrew
like
a
bridle
that
real
jam
all
spangled
with
brass
nails
but
who
knows
whether
it
right
or
wrong
why
not
one
in
ten
thousand
if
i
had
my
religion
to
choose
and
war
able
to
judge
for
myself
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
just
ask
myself
who
leads
the
best
lives
now
says
he
i
wo
say
who
do
because
it
would
look
like
vanity
to
say
it
was
the
folks
who
hold
to
our
platform
but
i
tell
you
who
do
it
ai
them
that
makes
the
greatest
professions
always
and
mind
what
i
tell
you
sam
when
you
go
with
your
clocks
away
down
east
to
nova
scotia
and
them
wild
provinces
keep
a
bright
look
out
on
them
as
cant
too
much
for
a
long
face
is
plaguy
apt
to
cover
a
long
conscience
that
a
fact
no
xxv
taming
a
shrew
the
road
from
amherst
to
parrsboro
is
tedious
and
uninteresting
in
places
it
is
made
so
straight
that
you
can
see
several
miles
of
it
before
you
which
produces
an
appearance
of
interminable
length
while
the
stunted
growth
of
the
spruce
and
birch
trees
bespeaks
a
cold
thin
soil
and
invests
the
scene
with
a
melancholy
and
sterile
aspect
here
and
there
occurs
a
little
valley
with
its
meandering
stream
and
verdant
and
fertile
interval
which
though
possessing
nothing
peculiar
to
distinguish
it
from
many
others
of
the
same
kind
strikes
the
traveller
as
superior
to
them
all
from
the
contrast
to
the
surrounding
country
one
of
these
secluded
spots
attracted
my
attention
from
the
number
and
neatness
of
the
buildings
which
its
proprietor
a
tanner
and
currier
had
erected
for
the
purposes
of
his
trade
slick
said
he
knew
him
and
he
guessed
it
was
a
pity
he
could
keep
his
wife
in
as
good
order
as
he
did
his
factory
they
do
hitch
their
horses
together
well
at
all
he
is
properly
said
he
he
is
afeerd
to
call
his
soul
his
own
and
he
leads
the
life
of
a
dog
you
never
seed
the
beat
of
it
i
vow
did
you
ever
see
a
rooster
hatch
a
brood
of
chickens
no
said
i
not
that
i
can
recollect
well
then
i
have
said
he
and
if
he
do
look
like
a
fool
all
the
time
he
is
on
the
eggs
it
a
pity
no
soul
could
help
larfin
to
see
him
our
old
nigger
january
snow
had
a
spite
agin
one
of
father
roosters
seein
that
he
was
a
coward
and
fight
he
used
to
call
him
dearborne
arter
our
general
that
behaved
so
ugly
to
canada
and
says
he
one
day
guess
you
are
no
better
than
a
hen
you
everlastin
old
villain
and
make
you
a
larfin
stock
to
all
the
poultry
i
put
a
trick
on
you
you
bear
in
mind
all
your
born
days
so
he
catches
old
dearborne
and
pulls
all
the
feathers
off
his
breast
and
strips
him
as
naked
as
when
he
was
born
from
his
throat
clean
down
to
his
tail
and
then
takes
a
bundle
of
nettles
and
gives
him
a
proper
switchin
that
stung
him
and
made
him
smart
like
mad
then
he
warms
some
eggs
and
puts
them
in
a
nest
and
sets
the
old
cock
right
a
top
of
well
the
warmth
of
the
eggs
felt
good
to
the
poor
critter
naked
belly
and
kinder
kept
the
itchin
of
the
nettles
down
and
he
was
glad
to
bide
where
he
was
and
whenever
he
was
tired
and
got
off
his
skin
felt
so
cold
he
run
right
back
and
squat
down
agin
and
when
his
feathers
began
to
grow
and
he
got
obstropolous
he
got
another
ticklin
with
the
nettles
that
made
him
return
double
quick
to
his
location
in
a
little
time
he
larnt
the
trade
real
complete
now
this
john
porter
and
there
he
is
on
the
bridge
i
vow
i
never
seed
the
beat
o
that
speak
of
old
satan
and
he
sure
to
appear
well
he
jist
like
old
dearborne
only
fit
to
hatch
eggs
when
we
came
to
the
bridge
slick
stopped
his
horse
to
shake
hands
with
porter
whom
he
recognized
as
an
old
acquaintance
and
customer
he
enquired
after
a
he
had
smuggled
from
the
states
for
him
and
enlarged
on
the
value
of
such
a
machine
and
the
cleverness
of
his
countrymen
who
invented
such
useful
and
profitable
articles
and
was
recommending
a
new
process
of
tanning
when
a
female
voice
from
the
house
was
heard
vociferating
john
porter
come
here
this
minute
coming
my
dear
said
the
husband
come
here
i
say
directly
why
do
you
stand
talking
to
that
yankee
villain
there
the
poor
husband
hung
his
head
looked
silly
and
bidding
us
returned
slowly
to
the
house
as
we
drove
on
slick
said
that
was
me
i
did
that
did
what
said
i
that
was
me
that
sent
him
back
i
called
him
and
not
his
wife
i
had
that
bestowment
ever
since
i
was
knee
high
or
so
i
a
real
complete
hand
at
ventriloquism
i
can
take
off
any
man
voice
i
ever
heerd
to
the
very
nines
if
there
was
a
law
agin
forgin
that
as
there
is
for
handwritin
i
guess
i
should
have
been
hanged
long
ago
i
had
high
goes
with
it
many
a
time
but
it
plaguy
dangersome
and
i
do
practise
it
now
but
seldom
i
had
a
real
bout
with
that
citizen
wife
once
and
completely
broke
her
in
for
him
she
went
as
gentle
as
a
circus
horse
for
a
space
but
he
let
her
have
her
head
agin
and
she
as
bad
as
ever
now
i
tell
you
how
it
was
i
was
down
to
the
island
clocks
and
who
should
i
meet
but
john
porter
well
i
traded
with
him
for
one
part
cash
part
truck
and
produce
and
also
put
off
on
him
that
you
heerd
me
axin
about
and
it
was
pretty
considerable
on
in
the
evenin
afore
we
finished
our
trade
i
came
home
along
with
him
and
had
the
clock
in
the
wagon
to
fix
it
up
for
him
and
to
show
him
how
to
regilate
it
well
as
we
neared
his
house
he
began
to
fret
and
take
on
dreadful
oneasy
says
he

stiff
upper

the
broomstick
well
acquainted
together
and
says
i
do
you

her
tantrums
i
make
a
fair
division
of
the
house
with
her
if
it
was
me
i
take
the
inside
and
allocate
her
the
outside
of
it
pretty
quick
that
a
fact
well
when
we
came
to
the
house
there
was
no
light
in
it
and
the
poor
critter
looked
so
streaked
and
down
in
the
mouth
i
felt
proper
sorry
for
him
when
he
rapped
at
the
door
she
called
out
there
me

says
porter
is
it
said
she

in
a
whisper
says

the
barn

see
is
a
good
piece
off
to
the
eastward
of
the
house
and
as
soon

was
cleverly
out

told
like
a
notch
on
a

that
as
a
taste

as
sure

i
tan
your

you

you
old
ungainly
tempered
heifer
you
when
i
went
to
the
barn
says
i
porter
your
wife
made
right
at
me
like
one
ravin
distracted
mad
when
i
opened
the
door
thinkin
it
was
you
and
i
was
obliged
to
give
her
a
crack
or
two
of
the
cowskin
to
get
clear
of
her
it
has
effectuated
a
cure
completely
now
foller

and
you
be
master
once
more
in
your
own
house
she
all
docity
jist
now
keep
her
so
as
we
returned
we
saw
a
light
in
the
keepin
room
the
fire
was
blazin
up
cheerfulsome
and
marm
porter
moved
about
as
brisk
as
a
parched
pea
though
as
silent
as
dumb
and
our
supper
was
ready
in
no
time
as
soon
as
she
took
her
seat
and
sot
down
she
sprung
right
up
on
eend
as
if
she
had
sot
on
a
pan
of
hot
coals
and
coloured
all
over
and
then
tears
started
in
her
eyes
thinks
i
to
myself
i
calculate
i
wrote
that
lesson
in
large
letters
anyhow
i
can
read
that
writin
without
spellin
and
no
mistake
i
guess
you
got
pretty
well
warmed
thereabouts
this
hitch
then
she
tried
it
agin
first
she
sot
on
one
leg
then
on
quite
oneasy
and
then
right
atwixt
both
about
dreadfully
like
a
man
that
rode
all
day
on
a
bad
saddle
and
lost
a
little
leather
on
the
way
if
you
had
seed
how
she
stared
at
porter
it
would
have
made
you
snicker
she
credit
her
eyes
he
war
drunk
and
he
war
crazy
but
there
he
sot
as
peeked
and
as
meechin
as
you
please
she
seemed
all
struck
up
of
a
heap
at
his
rebellion
the
next
day
when
i
was
about
startin
i
advised
him
to
act
like
a
man
and
keep
the
weather
gage
now
he
had
it
and
all
would
be
well
but
the
poor
critter
only
held
on
a
day
or
two
she
soon
got
the
upper
hand
of
him
and
made
him
confess
all
and
by
all
accounts
he
leads
a
worse
life
now
than
ever
i
put
that
trick
on
him
jist
now
to
try
him
and
i
see
it
gone
goose
with
him
the
jig
is
up
with
him
she
soon
call
him
with
a
whistle
like
a
dog
i
often
think
of
the
hornpipe
she
danced
there
in
the
dark
along
with
me
to
the
music
of
my
whip
she
touched
it
off
in
great
style
that
a
fact
i
shall
mind
that
go
one
while
i
promise
you
it
was
actilly
equal
to
a
play
at
old
bowry
you
may
depend
squire
the
only
way
to
tame
a
shrew
is
by
the
cowskin
grandfather
slick
was
raised
all
along
the
coast
of
kent
in
old
england
and
he
used
to
say
there
was
an
old
saying
there
which
i
expect
is
not
far
off
the
mark
woman
a
dog
and
a
walnut
tree
the
more
you
lick
the
better
they
be
no
xxvi
the
minister
horn
mug
this
country
said
slick
abounds
in
superior
mill
privileges
and
one
would
naterally
calculate
that
such
a
sight
of
water
power
would
have
led
to
a
knowledge
of
machinery
i
guess
if
a
bluenose
was
to
go
to
one
of
our
free
and
enlightened
citizens
and
tell
him
nova
scotia
was
intersected
with
rivers
and
brooks
in
all
directions
and
nearly
one
quarter
of
it
covered
with
water
he
say
start
right
off
and
see
it
i
vow
for
i
guess
i
larn
somethin
i
allot
i
get
another
wrinkle
away
down
east
there
with
such
splendid
chances
for
experimentin
what
mills
they
must
have
to
a
sartainty
i
see
such
new
combinations
and
such
new
applications
of
the
force
of
water
to
motion
that
i
make
my
fortin
for
we
can
improve
on
anything
well
he
find
his
mistake
out
i
guess
as
i
did
once
when
i
took
passage
in
the
night
at
new
york
for
providence
and
found
myself
the
next
mornin
clean
out
to
sea
steerin
away
for
cape
hatteras
in
the
charleston
steamer
he
find
he
gone
to
the
wrong
place
i
reckon
there
ai
a
mill
of
any
kind
in
the
province
fit
to
be
seen
if
we
had
we
sarve
as
we
do
the
gamblin
houses
down
south
pull
right
down
there
would
be
one
on
left
in
eight
and
forty
hours
some
domestic
factories
they
ought
to
have
here
it
an
essential
part
of
the
social
system
now
we
run
to
the
other
extreme
got
to
be
too
big
an
interest
with
us
and
ai
suited
to
the
political
institutions
of
our
great
country
natur
designed
us
for
an
agricultural
people
and
our
government
was
predicated
on
the
supposition
that
we
would
be
so
hopewell
was
of
the
same
opinion
he
was
a
great
hand
at
gardenin
orchadin
farmin
and
what
not
one
evenin
i
was
up
to
his
house
and
says
he
what
do
you
say
to
a
bottle
of
my
old
genuine
cider
i
guess
i
got
some
that
will
take
the
shine
off
of
your
father
by
a
long
chalk
much
as
the
old
gentleman
brags
of
i
never
bring
it
out
afore
him
he
thinks
he
has
the
best
in
all
connecticut
it
an
innocent
ambition
that
and
sam
it
would
be
but
a
poor
thing
for
me
to
gratify
my
pride
at
the
expense
of
humblin
so
i
never
lets
on
that
i
have
any
better
but
keep
dark
about
this
superfine
particular
article
of
mine
for
i
as
lives
he
think
so
as
not
he
was
a
real
primitive
good
man
was
minister
got
some
said
he
was
bottled
that
very
year
that
glorious
action
was
fought
atween
the
constitution
and
the
guerriere
perhaps
the
whole
world
could
show
such
a
brilliant
whippin
as
that
was
it
was
a
splendid
deed
that
a
fact
the
british
can
whip
the
whole
airth
and
we
can
whip
the
british
it
was
a
bright
promise
for
our
young
eagle
a
noble
bird
that
too
great
strenth
great
courage
and
surpassing
sagacity
well
he
went
down
to
the
cellar
and
brought
up
a
bottle
with
a
stick
tied
to
its
neck
and
day
and
date
to
it
like
on
the
trees
in
squire
hendrick
garden
like
to
see
them
cobwebs
says
he
as
he
brushed
off
are
like
grey
hairs
in
an
old
man
head
they
indicate
venerable
old
age
as
he
uncorked
it
says
he
guess
sam
this
will
warm
your
gizzard
my
boy
i
guess
our
great
nation
may
be
stumped
to
produce
more
eleganter
liquor
than
this
here
it
the
dandy
that
a
fact
that
said
he
his
lips
and
lookin
at
its
sparklin
top
and
layin
back
his
head
and
tippin
off
a
horn
mug
brim
full
of
it
said
he
and
his
eyes
twinkled
agin
for
it
was
plaguy
strong
is
the
produce
of
my
own
orchard
i
said
says
i
never
see
you
it
out
of
that
horn
mug
that
i
do
think
of
one
of
your
texts
that
sam
says
he
you
always
had
a
special
memory
when
you
was
a
boy
says
i
that
the
horn
of
the
righteous
man
shall
be
exalted
i
guess
that
what
they
mean
by
exaltin
the
horn
ai
it
lord
if
ever
you
was
to
new
orleens
and
seed
a
black
thunder
cloud
rise
right
up
and
cover
the
whole
sky
in
a
it
you
a
thought
of
it
if
you
had
seed
his
face
it
looked
as
dark
as
egypt
shame
says
he
that
ondecent
and
let
me
tell
you
that
a
man
that
jokes
on
such
subjects
shows
both
a
lack
of
wit
and
sense
too
i
like
mirth
you
know
i
do
for
it
only
the
pharisees
and
hypocrites
that
wear
long
faces
but
then
mirth
must
be
innocent
to
please
me
and
when
i
see
a
man
make
merry
with
serious
things
i
set
him
down
as
a
lost
sheep
that
comes
of
your
speculatin
to
lowell
and
i
vow
them
factorin
towns
will
corrupt
our
youth
of
both
sexes
and
become
hotbeds
of
iniquity
evil
communications
endamnify
good
manners
as
sure
as
rates
one
scabby
sheep
will
infect
a
whole
flock
vice
is
as
catchin
as
that
nasty
disease
the
scotch
have
it
got
by
shakin
hands
and
both
eend
in
the
same
way
in
brimstone
i
approbate
domestic
factories
but
nothin
further
for
us
it
do
suit
us
or
our
institutions
a
republic
is
only
calculated
for
an
enlightened
and
vartuous
people
and
folks
chiefly
in
the
farmin
line
that
is
an
innocent
and
a
happy
vocation
agriculture
was
ordained
by
him
as
made
us
for
our
chief
occupation
thinks
i
here
a
pretty
how
do
you
do
i
in
for
it
now
that
a
fact
he
jist
fall
to
and
read
a
regular
sarmon
and
he
knows
so
many
by
heart
he
never
stop
it
would
take
a
philadelphia
lawyer
to
answer
him
so
says
i
i
ax
your
pardon
i
feel
very
ugly
at
havin
given
you
offence
but
i
did
mean
it
i
do
assure
you
it
jist
popped
out
unexpectedly
like
a
cork
out
of
one
of
them
cider
bottles
i
do
my
possibles
that
the
like
happen
agin
you
may
depend
so
we
drink
a
glass
to
our
reconciliation
i
will
said
he
we
will
have
another
bottle
too
but
i
must
put
a
little
water
into
my
glass
and
he
dwelt
on
that
word
and
looked
at
me
quite
feelin
as
much
as
to
say
do
for
goodness
sake
make
use
of
that
word
horn
agin
for
it
a
joke
i
do
like
my
head
hai
quite
the
strength
my
cider
has
taste
this
sam
said
he
openin
of
another
bottle
of
the
same
age
as
the
last
but
made
of
different
apples
and
i
am
fairly
stumped
sometimes
to
say
which
is
best
are
the
pleasures
says
he
a
country
life
a
man
own
labour
provides
him
with
food
and
an
appetite
to
enjoy
it
let
him
look
which
way
he
will
and
he
sees
the
goodness
and
bounty
of
his
creator
his
wisdom
his
power
and
his
majesty
there
never
was
anything
so
true
as
that
old
sayin
man
made
the
town
but
god
made
the
country
and
both
bespeak
their
different
architects
in
terms
too
plain
to
be
misunderstood
the
one
is
filled
with
virtue
and
the
other
with
vice
one
is
the
abode
of
plenty
and
the
other
of
want
one
is
a
of
nice
pure
water
and
one
a
our
towns
are
gettin
so
commercial
and
factoring
that
they
will
soon
generate
mobs
sam
how
true
that
has
turned
out
hai
it
he
could
see
near
about
as
far
into
a
millstone
as
them
that
picks
the
hole
into
it
mobs
will
introduce
disobedience
and
defiance
to
laws
and
that
must
eend
in
anarchy
and
bloodshed
no
said
the
old
man
raising
his
voice
and
giving
the
table
a
wipe
with
his
fist
that
made
the
glasses
all
jingle
agin
me
the
country
that
country
to
which
he
that
made
it
said
bring
forth
grass
the
herb
yieldin
seed
and
the
tree
yieldin
fruit
and
who
saw
that
it
was
good
let
me
jine
with
the
feathered
tribe
in
the
mornin
i
hope
you
get
up
airly
now
sam
when
you
was
a
boy
there
was
no
gittin
you
out
of
bed
at
no
rate
and
at
sunset
in
the
hymns
which
they
utter
in
full
tide
of
song
to
their
creator
let
me
pour
out
the
thankfulness
of
my
heart
to
the
giver
of
all
good
things
for
the
numerous
blessings
i
enjoy
and
intreat
him
to
bless
my
increase
that
i
may
have
wherewithal
to
relieve
the
wants
of
others
as
he
prevents
and
relieves
mine
no
give
me
the
country
it
minister
was
jist
like
a
horse
that
has
the
spavin
he
sot
off
considerable
stiff
at
first
but
when
he
once
got
under
way
he
got
on
like
a
house
a
fire
he
went
like
the
wind
full
split
he
was
jist
beginnin
to
warm
on
the
subject
and
i
knew
if
he
did
what
wonderful
bottom
he
had
how
he
would
hang
on
for
ever
so
says
i
think
so
too
minister
i
like
the
country
i
always
sleep
better
there
than
in
towns
it
ai
so
plaguy
hot
nor
so
noisy
neither
and
then
it
a
pleasant
thing
to
set
out
on
the
stoop
and
smoke
in
the
cool
ai
it
i
think
says
i
minister
that
that
uncommon
handsum
cider
of
desarves
a
pipe
what
do
you
think
says
he
think
myself
a
pipe
would
be
amiss
and
i
got
some
real
good
varginny
as
you
ever
seed
a
present
from
rowland
randolph
an
old
college
chum
and
none
the
worse
to
my
palate
sam
for
bringin
bygone
recollections
with
it
phoebe
my
dear
said
he
to
his
darter
the
pipes
and
tobacco
as
soon
as
the
old
gentleman
fairly
got
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
i
give
phoebe
a
wink
as
much
as
to
say
war
that
well
done
that
what
i
call
a
most
particular
handsum
fix
he
can
talk
now
and
that
i
do
like
to
hear
him
do
but
he
ca
make
a
speech
or
preach
a
sarmon
and
that
i
do
like
to
hear
him
do
except
on
sabbath
day
or
up
to
town
hall
on
oration
times
minister
was
an
uncommon
pleasant
man
for
there
was
nothin
he
did
know
except
when
he
got
his
dander
up
and
then
he
did
spin
out
his
yarns
for
everlastinly
but
i
of
his
opinion
if
the
folks
here
want
their
country
to
go
ahead
they
must
honour
the
plough
and
general
campbell
ought
to
hammer
that
into
their
noddles
full
chisel
as
hard
as
he
can
drive
i
could
larn
him
somethin
i
guess
about
hammerin
he
up
to
it
ai
every
one
that
knows
how
to
beat
a
thing
into
a
head
how
could
i
have
sold
so
many
thousand
clocks
if
i
had
had
that
knack
why
i
would
have
sold
half
a
dozen
you
may
depend
agriculture
is
not
only
neglected
but
degraded
here
what
a
number
of
young
folks
there
seem
to
be
in
these
parts
about
titivated
out
real
jam
in
their
clothes
nothin
it
melancholy
to
think
on
it
that
the
effect
of
the
last
war
the
idleness
and
extravagance
of
those
times
took
root
and
bore
fruit
abundantly
and
now
the
young
people
are
above
their
business
they
are
too
high
in
the
instep
that
a
fact
old
drivvle
down
here
to
maccan
said
to
me
one
day
gracious
sake
says
he
slick
do
tell
me
what
i
shall
do
with
johnny
his
mother
sets
great
store
by
him
and
thinks
he
the
makin
of
a
considerable
smart
man
he
growin
up
fast
now
and
i
am
pretty
well
to
do
in
the
world
and
reasonable
forehanded
but
i
do
know
what
the
dogs
to
put
him
to
the
lawyers
are
like
spiders
they
eat
up
all
the
flies
and
i
guess
they
have
to
eat
each
other
soon
for
there
more
on
than
causes
now
every
court
the
doctors
trade
is
a
poor
one
too
they
do
get
barely
cash
enough
to
pay
for
their
medicines
i
never
seed
a
country
practitioner
yet
that
made
anything
worth
speakin
of
then
as
for
preachin
why
church
and
dissenters
are
pretty
much
tarred
with
the
same
stick
they
live
in
the
same
pastur
with
their
flocks
and
between
it
fed
down
pretty
close
i
tell
you
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
with
him
says
i
tell
you
if
you
wo
be
miffy
with
me
with
you
indeed
said
he
guess
i
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
it
ai
every
day
one
gets
a
chance
to
consult
with
a
person
of
your
experience
i
count
it
quite
a
privilege
to
have
the
opinion
of
such
an
understandin
man
as
you
be
says
i
a
stick
and
give
him
a
real
good
quiltin
jist
tantune
him
like
blazes
and
set
him
to
work
what
does
the
critter
want
you
have
a
good
farm
for
him
let
him
go
and
airn
his
bread
and
when
he
can
raise
that
let
him
get
a
wife
to
make
butter
for
it
and
when
he
has
more
of
both
than
he
wants
let
him
sell
and
lay
up
his
money
and
he
will
soon
have
his
bread
buttered
on
both
sides
put
him
to
eh
why
put
him
to
the
plough
the
most
nateral
the
most
happy
the
most
innocent
and
the
host
healthy
employment
in
the
world
said
the
old
man
and
he
did
not
look
over
half
pleased
markets
are
so
confounded
dull
labour
so
high
and
the
banks
and
great
folks
all
up
so
there
do
seem
much
encouragement
for
farmers
it
hard
rubbin
nowadays
to
live
by
the
plough
be
a
hard
workin
poor
man
all
his
days
says
i
he
wants
to
get
rich
by
farmin
he
can
do
that
too
let
him
sell
his
wheat
and
eat
his
oatmeal
and
rye
send
his
beef
mutton
and
poultry
to
market
and
eat
his
pork
and
potatoes
make
his
own
cloth
weave
his
own
linen
and
keep
out
of
shops
and
he
soon
grow
rich
there
are
more
fortin
got
by
savin
than
by
makin
i
guess
a
plaguy
sight
he
ca
eat
his
cake
and
have
it
too
that
a
fact
no
make
a
farmer
of
him
and
you
will
have
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
an
honest
an
independent
and
a
respectable
member
of
society
more
honest
than
traders
more
independent
than
professional
men
and
more
respectable
than
either
says
marm
drivvle
and
she
began
to
clear
her
throat
for
action
she
slumped
down
her
knittin
and
clawed
off
her
spectacles
and
looked
right
straight
at
me
so
as
to
take
good
aim
i
seed
a
regular
i
knew
it
would
bust
somewhere
sartin
and
make
all
smoke
agin
so
i
cleared
out
and
left
old
drivvle
to
stand
the
squall
i
conceit
he
must
have
had
a
tempestical
time
of
it
for
she
had
get
her
ebenezer
up
and
looked
like
a
proper
sneezer
make
her
johnny
a
farmer
eh
i
guess
that
was
too
much
for
the
like
o
her
to
stomach
pride
squire
continued
the
clockmaker
with
such
an
air
of
concern
that
i
verily
believe
the
man
feels
an
interest
in
the
welfare
of
a
province
in
which
he
has
spent
so
long
a
time
pride
squire
and
a
false
pride
too
is
the
ruin
of
this
country
i
hope
i
may
be
skinned
if
it
ai
no
xxvii
the
white
nigger
one
of
the
most
amiable
and
at
the
same
time
most
amusing
traits
in
the
clockmaker
character
was
the
attachment
and
kindness
with
which
he
regarded
his
horse
he
considered
old
clay
as
far
above
a
provincial
horse
as
he
did
one
of
his
free
and
enlightened
citizens
superior
to
a
bluenose
he
treated
him
as
a
travelling
companion
and
when
conversation
flagged
between
us
would
often
soliloquize
to
him
a
habit
contracted
from
pursuing
his
journeys
alone
well
now
he
would
say
old
clay
i
guess
you
took
your
time
up
that
hill
we
progress
now
go
along
you
old
sculpin
and
turn
out
your
toes
i
reckon
you
are
as
deff
as
a
shad
do
you
hear
there
go
ahead
old
clay
there
now
he
say
squire
ai
that
dreadful
pretty
there
action
that
looks
about
right
legs
all
under
him
gathers
all
up
snug
no
bobbin
of
his
head
no
rollin
of
his
shoulders
no
wabblin
of
his
hind
parts
but
steady
as
a
pump
bolt
and
the
motion
all
underneath
when
he
fairly
lays
himself
to
it
he
trots
like
all
vengeance
then
look
at
his
ear
jist
like
rabbit
none
o
your
like
them
amherst
beasts
half
horses
half
pigs
but
strait
up
and
and
not
too
near
at
the
tips
for
that
i
consait
always
shows
a
horse
ai
true
to
draw
there
are
only
two
things
squire
worth
at
in
a
horse
action
and
soundness
for
i
never
saw
a
critter
that
had
good
action
that
was
a
bad
beast
old
clay
puts
me
in
mind
of
one
of
our
free
and
enlightened
excuse
me
said
i
slick
but
really
you
appropriate
that
word
to
your
countrymen
as
if
you
thought
no
other
people
in
the
world
were
entitled
to
it
but
yourselves
neither
be
they
said
he
we
first
sot
the
example
look
at
our
declaration
of
independence
it
was
writ
by
jefferson
and
he
was
the
first
man
of
the
age
perhaps
the
world
never
seed
his
ditto
it
a
beautiful
piece
of
penmanship
that
he
gave
the
british
the
butt
eend
of
his
mind
there
i
calculate
you
could
falt
it
in
no
particular
it
generally
allowed
to
be
his
cap
shief
in
the
first
page
of
it
second
section
and
first
varse
are
these
words
hold
this
truth
to
be
that
all
men
are
created
equal
i
guess
king
george
turned
his
quid
when
he
read
that
it
was
somethin
to
chaw
on
he
had
been
used
to
the
flavour
of
i
reckon
jefferson
forgot
to
insert
one
little
word
said
i
he
should
have
said
white
men
for
as
it
now
stands
it
is
a
practical
untruth
in
a
country
which
tolerates
domestic
slavery
in
its
worst
and
most
forbidding
form
it
is
a
declaration
of
shame
and
not
of
independence
it
is
as
perfect
a
misnomer
as
ever
i
knew
well
said
he
i
must
admit
there
is
a
screw
loose
somewhere
thereabouts
and
i
wish
it
would
convene
to
congress
to
do
or
another
about
our
niggers
but
i
am
not
quite
certified
how
that
is
to
be
sot
to
rights
i
consait
that
you
do
understand
us
but
said
he
evading
the
subject
with
his
usual
dexterity
we
deal
only
in
niggers
and
those
gentlemen
do
seem
fit
for
much
else
but
slavery
i
do
suppose
they
ai
fit
to
contrive
for
themselves
they
are
jist
like
grasshoppers
they
dance
and
sing
all
summer
and
when
winter
comes
they
have
nothin
provided
for
it
and
lay
down
and
die
they
require
some
one
to
see
arter
them
now
we
deal
in
black
niggers
only
but
the
bluenoses
sell
their
own
species
they
trade
in
white
slaves
thank
god
said
i
slavery
does
not
exist
in
any
part
of
his
majesty
dominions
now
we
have
at
last
wiped
off
that
national
stain
not
quite
i
guess
said
he
with
an
air
of
triumph
it
ai
done
with
in
nova
scotia
for
i
have
seed
these
human
cattle
sales
with
my
own
eyes
i
was
availed
of
the
truth
of
it
up
here
to
old
last
november
i
tell
you
the
story
said
he
and
as
this
story
of
the
clockmaker
contained
some
extraordinary
statements
which
i
had
never
heard
of
before
i
noted
it
in
my
journal
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
their
truth
and
if
founded
on
fact
of
laying
them
before
the
proper
authorities
last
fall
said
he
i
was
on
my
way
to
partridge
island
to
ship
off
some
truck
and
produce
i
had
taken
in
in
the
way
of
trade
and
as
i
neared
old
furlong
house
i
seed
an
amazin
crowd
of
folks
about
the
door
i
said
to
myself
says
i
who
dead
and
what
to
pay
now
what
on
airth
is
the
meanin
of
all
this
is
it
a
vandew
or
a
weddin
or
a
rollin
frolic
or
a
religious
stir
or
what
is
it
thinks
i
i
see
so
i
hitches
old
clay
to
the
fence
and
walks
in
it
was
some
time
afore
i
was
able
to
swiggle
my
way
through
the
crowd
and
get
into
the
house
and
when
i
did
who
should
i
see
but
deacon
westfall
a
smooth
faced
slick
haired
meechin
chap
as
you
see
in
a
hundred
on
a
stool
with
an
auctioneer
hammer
in
his
hand
and
afore
him
was
one
jerry
oaks
and
his
wife
and
two
little
orphan
children
the
prettiest
little
toads
i
ever
beheld
in
all
my
born
days
said
he
will
begin
the
sale
by
putting
up
jerry
oaks
of
apple
river
a
considerable
of
a
smart
man
yet
and
can
do
many
little
chores
besides
feedin
the
children
and
pigs
i
guess
he
near
about
worth
his
keep
you
warrant
him
sound
wind
and
limb
says
a
tall
ragged
lookin
countryman
he
looks
to
me
as
if
he
was
foundered
in
both
feet
and
had
a
string
halt
into
the
bargain
you
are
as
old
as
i
be
says
jerry
you
may
be
foundered
too
young
man
i
have
seen
the
day
when
you
would
dare
to
pass
that
joke
on
me
big
as
you
be
any
gentleman
bid
for
him
says
the
deacon
cheap
at
deacon
said
jerry
surely
your
honour
is
for
to
sell
me
separate
from
my
poor
old
wife
are
you
fifty
years
have
we
lived
together
as
man
and
wife
and
a
good
wife
has
she
been
to
me
through
all
my
troubles
and
trials
and
god
knows
i
have
had
enough
of
no
one
knows
my
ways
and
my
ailments
but
her
and
who
can
tend
me
so
kind
or
who
will
bear
with
the
complaints
of
a
poor
old
man
but
his
wife
do
deacon
and
heaven
bless
you
for
it
and
yours
do
sell
us
together
we
have
but
a
few
days
to
live
now
death
will
divide
us
soon
enough
leave
her
to
close
my
old
eyes
when
the
struggle
comes
and
when
it
comes
to
you
deacon
as
come
it
must
to
us
all
may
this
good
deed
rise
up
for
you
as
a
memorial
before
god
i
wish
it
had
pleased
him
to
have
taken
us
afore
it
came
to
this
but
his
will
be
done
and
he
hung
his
head
as
if
he
felt
he
had
drained
the
cup
of
degradation
to
its
dregs
afford
it
jerry
ca
afford
it
old
man
said
the
deacon
with
such
a
smile
as
a
november
sun
gives
atween
clouds
year
they
took
oats
for
rates
now
nothin
but
wheat
will
go
down
and
that
as
good
as
cash
and
you
hang
on
as
most
of
you
do
yet
these
many
years
there
old
joe
crowe
i
believe
in
my
conscience
he
will
live
for
ever
the
biddin
then
went
on
and
he
was
sold
for
six
shillings
a
week
well
the
poor
critter
gave
one
long
loud
deep
groan
and
then
folded
his
arms
over
his
breast
so
tight
that
he
seemed
tryin
to
keep
in
his
heart
from
bustin
i
pitied
the
misfortinate
wretch
from
my
soul
i
do
know
as
i
ever
felt
so
streaked
afore
not
so
his
wife
she
was
all
tongue
she
begged
and
prayed
and
cryed
and
scolded
and
talked
at
the
very
tip
eend
of
her
voice
till
she
became
poor
critter
exhausted
and
went
off
in
a
faintin
fit
and
they
ketched
her
up
and
carried
her
out
to
the
air
and
she
was
sold
in
that
condition
well
i
could
make
head
or
tail
of
all
this
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
and
ears
so
says
i
to
john
porter
him
that
has
that
catamount
of
a
wife
that
i
had
such
a
touss
with
porter
says
i
ever
seed
or
heerd
tell
of
the
like
of
this
what
under
the
sun
does
it
all
mean
what
has
that
critter
done
that
he
should
be
sold
arter
that
fashion
said
he
nothin
and
that
the
reason
they
sell
him
this
is
town
day
and
we
always
sell
the
poor
for
the
year
to
the
lowest
bidder
them
that
will
keep
them
for
the
lowest
sum
gets
them
says
i
feller
that
bought
him
is
a
pauper
himself
to
my
sartin
knowledge
if
you
were
to
take
him
up
by
the
heels
and
shake
him
for
a
week
you
could
shake
sixpence
out
of
him
how
can
he
keep
him
it
appears
to
me
the
poor
buy
the
poor
here
and
that
they
all
starve
together
says
i
was
a
very
good
man
once
lived
to
liverpool
so
good
he
said
he
had
sinned
for
seven
years
well
he
put
a
across
the
river
and
stopped
all
the
fish
from
goin
up
and
the
court
fined
him
fifty
pounds
for
it
and
this
good
man
was
so
wrathy
he
thought
he
should
feel
better
to
swear
a
little
but
conscience
told
him
it
was
wicked
so
he
compounded
with
conscience
and
cheated
the
devil
by
callin
it
a
dam
fine
business
now
friend
porter
if
this
is
your
poor
law
it
is
a
damn
poor
law
i
tell
you
and
no
good
can
come
of
such
doin
it
no
wonder
your
country
do
prosper
for
who
ever
heerd
of
a
blessin
on
such
carryins
on
as
this
says
i
you
ever
hear
tell
of
a
sartin
rich
man
that
had
a
beggar
called
lazarus
laid
at
his
gate
and
how
the
dogs
had
more
compassion
than
he
had
and
came
and
licked
his
sores
if
you
have
look
at
that
forehanded
and
man
there
deacon
westfall
and
you
see
the
rich
man
and
then
look
at
that
pauper
dragged
away
in
that
from
his
wife
for
ever
like
a
feller
to
states
prison
and
you
see
lazarus
recollect
what
follered
john
porter
and
have
neither
art
nor
part
in
it
as
you
are
a
christian
man
it
fairly
made
me
sick
all
day
john
porter
follered
me
out
of
the
house
and
as
i
was
old
clay
said
he
slick
says
he
never
seed
it
in
that
light
afore
for
it
our
custom
and
custom
you
know
will
reconcile
one
to
most
anything
i
must
say
it
does
appear
as
you
lay
it
out
an
unfeelin
way
of
providin
for
the
poor
but
as
touchin
the
matter
of
dividin
man
and
wife
and
he
peered
all
round
to
see
that
no
one
was
within
hearin
i
do
know
but
if
it
was
my
allotment
to
be
sold
i
as
lives
they
sell
me
separate
from
jane
as
not
for
it
appears
to
me
about
the
best
part
of
it
now
what
i
have
told
you
squire
said
the
clockmaker
is
the
truth
and
if
members
instead
of
their
everlastin
politics
would
only
look
into
these
matters
a
little
i
guess
it
would
be
far
better
for
the
country
so
as
for
our
declaration
of
independence
i
guess
you
need
twitt
me
with
our
for
we
deal
only
in
blacks
but
bluenose
approbates
no
distinction
in
colours
and
when
reduced
to
poverty
is
reduced
to
slavery
and
is
sold
a
white
nigger
no
xxviii
fire
in
the
dairy
as
we
approached
within
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
of
parrsboro
a
sudden
turn
of
the
road
brought
us
directly
in
front
of
a
large
wooden
house
consisting
of
two
stories
and
an
immense
roof
the
height
of
which
edifice
was
much
increased
by
a
stone
foundation
rising
several
feet
above
ground
now
did
you
ever
see
said
slick
such
a
catamaran
as
that
there
a
proper
goney
for
you
for
to
go
and
raise
such
a
as
that
and
he
as
much
use
for
it
i
do
suppose
as
my
old
wagon
here
has
for
a
fifth
wheel
bluenose
always
takes
keer
to
have
a
big
house
it
shows
a
big
man
and
one
that
considerable
forehanded
and
pretty
well
to
do
in
the
world
these
nova
scotians
turn
up
their
blue
noses
as
a
bottle
nose
porpoise
turns
up
his
snout
and
puff
and
snort
exactly
like
him
at
a
small
house
if
neighbour
carrit
has
a
two
story
house
all
filled
with
winders
like
sandy
hook
light
house
neighbour
parsnip
must
add
jist
two
feet
more
on
to
the
post
of
and
about
as
much
more
to
the
rafter
to
go
ahead
of
him
so
all
these
long
sarce
gentlemen
strive
who
can
get
the
furdest
in
the
sky
away
from
their
farms
in
new
england
our
maxim
is
a
small
house
and
a
most
an
everlastin
almighty
big
barn
but
these
critters
revarse
it
they
have
little
hovels
for
their
cattle
about
the
bigness
of
a
good
sizeable
and
a
house
for
the
humans
as
grand
as
noah
ark
well
jist
look
at
it
and
see
what
a
figur
it
does
cut
an
old
hat
stuffed
into
one
pane
of
glass
and
an
old
flannel
petticoat
as
yaller
as
jaundice
in
another
finish
off
the
front
an
old
pair
of
breeches
and
the
pad
of
a
new
worn
out
titivate
the
eend
while
the
backside
is
all
closed
up
on
account
of
the
wind
when
it
rains
if
there
a
pretty
it
a
pity
beds
toated
out
of
this
room
and
tubs
set
in
to
catch
soft
water
to
wash
while
the
clapboards
loose
at
the
eends
go
clap
clap
clap
like
gals
flax
and
the
winders
and
doors
keep
to
the
music
the
only
dry
place
in
the
house
is
in
the
chimbley
corner
where
the
folks
all
huddle
up
as
an
old
hen
and
her
chickens
do
under
a
cart
of
a
wet
day
wish
i
had
the
matter
of
half
a
dozen
pound
of
nails
you
hear
the
old
gentleman
in
the
grand
house
say
be
darned
if
i
do
for
if
i
had
i
fix
them
clapboards
i
guess
they
go
for
it
some
o
these
days
wish
you
had
his
wife
would
say
they
do
make
a
most
particular
unhansum
clatter
that
a
fact
and
so
they
let
it
be
till
the
next
tempestical
time
comes
and
then
they
wish
agin
now
this
grand
house
has
only
two
rooms
downstairs
that
are
altogether
slicked
up
and
finished
off
complete
the
other
is
jist
petitioned
off
rough
like
one
half
great
dark
entries
and
half
places
that
look
a
plaguy
sight
more
like
packin
boxes
than
rooms
well
all
upstairs
is
a
great
onfarnished
place
filled
with
every
sort
of
trumpery
in
natur
barrels
without
eends
half
husked
cast
off
clothes
and
bits
of
old
harness
sheep
skins
hides
and
wool
apples
one
half
rotten
and
half
squashed
a
thousand
or
two
of
shingles
that
have
bust
their
withes
and
broke
loose
all
over
the
floor
hay
rakes
forks
and
sickles
without
handles
or
teeth
rusty
scythes
and
odds
and
eends
without
number
when
anything
is
wanted
then
there
is
a
general
overhaul
of
the
whole
cargo
and
away
they
get
shifted
forrard
one
by
one
all
handled
over
and
chucked
into
a
heap
together
till
the
lost
one
is
found
and
the
next
time
away
they
get
pitched
to
the
starn
agin
higglety
pigglety
heels
over
head
like
sheep
takin
a
split
for
it
over
a
wall
only
they
increase
in
number
each
move
some
on
are
sure
to
get
broke
into
more
pieces
than
they
was
afore
whenever
i
see
one
of
these
grand
houses
and
a
hat
lookin
out
the
winder
with
nary
head
in
it
think
i
i
be
darned
if
a
place
for
a
wooden
clock
nothin
short
of
a
london
touch
would
go
down
with
them
folks
so
i
calculate
i
wo
alight
whenever
you
come
to
such
a
grand
place
as
this
squire
depend
o
the
farm
is
all
of
a
piece
great
crops
of
thistles
and
an
everlastin
yield
of
weeds
and
cattle
the
best
fed
of
any
in
the
country
for
they
are
always
in
the
grain
fields
or
mowin
lands
and
the
pigs
in
the
potato
patches
a
spic
and
span
new
gig
at
the
door
shinin
like
the
mud
banks
of
windsor
when
the
on
and
an
old
wrack
of
a
hay
wagon
with
its
tongue
onhitched
and
stickin
out
behind
like
a
pig
tail
all
indicate
a
big
man
he
above
thinkin
of
farmin
tools
he
sees
to
the
bran
new
gig
and
the
hired
helps
look
arter
the
carts
catch
him
with
his
clothes
on
agin
their
nasty
greasy
axles
like
a
tarry
nigger
not
he
indeed
he
stick
you
up
with
it
the
last
time
i
came
by
here
it
was
a
little
bit
arter
daylight
down
rainin
cats
and
dogs
and
as
dark
as
egypt
so
thinks
i
jist
turn
in
here
for
shelter
to
squire
bill
blake
well
i
knocks
away
at
the
front
door
till
i
thought
i
it
in
but
arter
awhile
to
no
purpose
and
findin
no
one
come
i
gropes
my
way
round
to
the
back
door
and
opens
it
and
feelin
all
along
the
partition
for
the
latch
of
the
keepin
room
without
finding
it
i
knocks
agin
when
some
one
from
inside
calls
out
thinks
i
i
do
cleverly
know
whether
that
indicates
in
or
out
it
plaguy
short
metre
that
a
fact
but
i
see
anyhow
well
arter
gropin
about
awhile
at
last
i
got
hold
of
the
string
and
lifted
the
latch
and
walked
in
and
there
sot
old
marm
blake
close
into
one
corner
of
the
chimbley
fireplace
in
a
chair
and
a
half
grown
black
half
asleep
in
corner
up
over
the
embers
be
you
said
marm
blake
i
ca
see
you
stranger
said
i
says
she
speakin
to
the
black
heifer
in
the
corner
says
she
agin
raisin
her
voice
believe
you
are
as
deff
as
a
post
get
up
this
minit
and
stir
the
coals
till
i
see
the
man
arter
the
coals
were
stirred
into
a
blaze
the
old
lady
surveyed
me
from
head
to
foot
then
she
axed
me
my
name
and
where
i
came
from
where
i
was
and
what
my
business
was
guess
said
she
must
be
reasonable
wet
sit
to
the
fire
and
dry
yourself
or
mayhap
your
health
may
be
endamnified
so
i
sot
down
and
we
soon
got
pretty
considerably
well
acquainted
and
quite
sociable
like
and
her
tongue
when
it
fairly
waked
up
began
to
run
like
a
when
the
gate
up
i
had
been
talkin
long
i
well
nigh
lost
sight
of
her
altogether
agin
for
little
beck
began
to
flourish
about
her
broom
right
and
left
in
great
style
up
and
she
did
raise
such
an
auful
thick
cloud
o
dust
i
did
know
if
i
should
ever
see
or
breathe
either
agin
well
when
all
was
sot
to
rights
and
the
fire
made
up
the
old
lady
began
to
apologize
for
havin
no
candles
she
said
she
had
a
grand
the
night
afore
and
used
them
all
up
and
a
whole
sight
of
vittals
too
the
old
man
had
been
well
since
and
had
gone
to
bed
airly
says
she
do
wish
with
all
my
heart
you
had
a
come
last
night
for
we
had
a
most
a
special
supper
punkin
pies
and
doughnuts
and
apple
sarce
and
a
roast
goose
stuffed
with
indian
puddin
and
a
pig
harslet
stewed
in
molasses
and
onions
and
i
do
know
what
all
and
the
fore
part
of
today
folks
called
to
finish
i
actilly
have
nothin
left
to
set
afore
you
for
it
was
none
o
your
parties
but
superfine
uppercrust
real
jam
and
we
made
clean
work
of
it
but
i
make
some
tea
anyhow
for
you
and
perhaps
arter
that
said
she
alterin
of
her
tone
expound
the
scriptures
for
it
one
while
since
i
heerd
them
laid
open
powerfully
i
hai
been
fairly
lifted
up
since
that
good
man
judas
oglethorp
travelled
this
road
and
then
she
gave
a
groan
and
hung
down
her
head
and
looked
to
see
how
the
land
lay
thereabouts
the
was
accordingly
put
on
and
some
lard
fried
into
oil
and
poured
into
a
tumbler
which
with
the
aid
of
an
inch
of
cotton
wick
served
as
a
make
shift
for
a
candle
well
arter
tea
we
sot
and
chatted
awhile
about
fashions
and
markets
and
sarmons
and
scandal
and
all
sorts
o
things
and
in
the
midst
of
it
in
runs
the
nigger
wench
screemin
out
at
the
tip
eend
of
her
voice
missus
missus
there
fire
in
the
dairy
fire
in
the
dairy
give
it
to
you
for
that
said
the
old
lady
give
it
you
for
that
you
hussy
all
your
carelessness
go
and
put
it
out
this
minit
how
on
airth
did
it
get
there
my
night
milk
gone
i
dare
say
run
this
minit
and
put
it
out
and
save
the
milk
i
am
dreadful
afeard
of
fire
i
always
was
from
a
boy
and
seein
the
poor
foolish
critter
seize
a
broom
in
her
fright
i
ups
with
the
and
follows
her
and
away
we
clipt
through
the
entry
she
callin
out
the
cellar
door
on
the
right
kear
of
the
close
horse
on
the
left
and
so
on
but
as
i
could
see
nothin
i
kept
right
straight
ahead
at
last
my
foot
kotched
in
somethin
or
another
that
pitched
me
somewhat
less
than
a
rod
or
so
right
agin
the
poor
black
critter
and
away
we
went
heels
over
head
i
heerd
a
splash
and
a
groan
and
i
smelt
somethin
plaguy
sour
but
i
could
see
nothin
at
last
i
got
hold
of
her
and
lifted
her
up
for
she
did
scream
but
made
a
strange
kind
of
chokin
noise
and
by
this
time
up
came
marm
blake
with
a
light
if
poor
beck
did
let
go
then
in
airnest
and
sing
out
for
dear
life
it
a
pity
for
she
had
gone
head
first
into
the
swill
tub
and
the
had
scalded
her
feet
she
kept
right
up
and
down
like
one
ravin
distracted
mad
and
like
anything
clawin
away
at
her
head
the
whole
time
to
clear
away
the
stuff
that
stuck
to
her
wool
i
held
in
as
long
as
i
could
till
i
thought
i
should
have
busted
for
no
soul
could
help
and
at
last
i
right
out
stupid
slut
you
said
the
old
lady
to
poor
beck
sarves
you
right
you
had
no
business
to
leave
it
there
i
pay
you
said
i
interferin
for
the
unfortunate
critter
gracious
marm
you
forget
the
fire
i
do
said
she
see
him
and
seizin
the
broom
that
had
fallen
from
the
nigger
hand
she
exclaimed
see
him
the
nasty
varmint
and
began
to
belabour
most
onmarcifully
a
poor
cur
that
the
noise
had
attracted
to
the
entry
teach
you
said
she
drink
milk
i
larn
you
to
steal
into
the
dairy
and
the
besot
critter
joined
chorus
with
beck
and
they
both
yelled
together
till
they
fairly
made
the
house
ring
agin
presently
old
squire
blake
popped
his
head
out
of
a
door
and
rubbin
his
eyes
half
asleep
and
half
awake
said
the
devil
to
pay
now
wife
nothin
says
she
fire
in
the
dairy
and
beck
in
the
swill
tub
that
all
do
make
such
a
touss
then
said
he
that
all
and
he
shot
tu
the
door
and
went
to
bed
agin
when
we
returned
to
the
keepin
room
the
old
lady
told
me
that
they
always
had
had
a
dog
called
ever
since
her
grandfather
major
donald
fraser
time
what
was
very
odd
says
she
one
on
would
drink
milk
if
he
had
a
chance
by
this
time
the
shower
was
over
and
the
moon
shinin
so
bright
and
clear
that
i
thought
i
better
be
up
and
stirrin
and
arter
slippin
a
few
cents
into
the
poor
nigger
wench
hand
i
took
leave
of
the
grand
folks
in
the
big
house
now
squire
among
these
farmers
you
may
lay
this
down
as
a
rule
the
bigger
the
house
the
bigger
the
fools
be
that
in
it
but
howsomever
i
never
call
to
mind
that
go
in
the
big
house
up
to
the
right
that
i
do
snicker
when
i
think
of
in
the
dairy
no
xxix
a
body
without
a
head
i
allot
you
had
ought
to
visit
our
great
country
squire
said
the
clockmaker
afore
you
quit
for
good
and
all
i
calculate
you
understand
us
the
most
splendid
location
atween
the
poles
is
the
united
states
and
the
first
man
alive
is
gineral
jackson
the
hero
of
the
age
him
that
skeered
the
british
out
of
their
seven
senses
then
there
the
great
danel
webster
it
generally
allowed
the
greatest
orator
on
the
face
of
the
airth
by
a
long
chalk
and
van
buren
and
clay
and
amos
kindle
and
judge
white
and
a
whole
raft
of
statesmen
up
to
everything
and
all
manner
of
politics
there
ai
the
beat
of
to
be
found
anywhere
if
you
was
to
hear
i
consait
you
hear
genuine
pure
english
for
once
anyhow
for
it
generally
allowed
we
speak
english
better
than
the
british
they
all
know
me
to
be
an
american
citizen
here
by
my
talk
for
we
speak
it
complete
in
new
england
yes
if
you
want
to
see
a
free
people
them
that
makes
their
own
laws
accordin
to
their
own
notions
go
to
the
states
indeed
if
you
can
falt
them
at
all
they
are
a
little
grain
too
free
our
folks
have
their
head
a
trifle
too
much
sometimes
particularly
in
elections
both
in
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
press
one
ought
to
blart
right
out
always
all
that
comes
uppermost
a
horse
that
too
free
frets
himself
and
his
rider
too
and
both
on
lose
flesh
in
the
long
run
i
as
lives
use
the
whip
sometimes
as
to
be
for
everlastinly
at
the
rein
one
arm
gets
plaguy
tired
that
a
fact
i
often
think
of
a
lesson
i
larnt
jehiel
quirk
once
for
lettin
his
tongue
outrun
his
good
manners
i
was
down
to
rhode
island
one
summer
to
larn
gildin
and
bronzin
so
as
to
give
the
finishin
touch
to
my
clocks
well
the
folks
elected
me
a
jist
to
poke
fun
at
me
and
jehiel
a
bean
pole
of
a
lawyer
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
so
one
day
up
to
town
hall
where
there
was
an
oration
to
be
delivered
on
our
independence
jist
afore
the
orator
commenced
in
runs
jehiel
in
a
most
hurry
and
says
he
wonder
says
he
ary
a
here
because
if
there
be
i
require
a
turn
of
his
office
and
then
said
he
up
to
me
and
callin
out
at
the
tip
eend
of
his
voice
slick
says
he
a
job
out
here
for
you
folks
snickered
a
good
deal
and
i
felt
my
spunk
like
half
flood
that
a
fact
but
i
bit
in
my
breath
and
spoke
quite
cool
says
i
duty
i
do
suppose
must
be
done
though
it
ai
the
most
agreeable
in
the
world
i
been
says
i
i
would
be
liable
to
a
fine
of
fifty
cents
for
sufferin
a
hog
to
run
at
large
and
as
you
are
the
biggest
one
i
presume
in
all
rhode
island
i
jist
begin
by
ringin
your
nose
to
prevent
you
for
the
futur
from
pokin
your
snout
where
you
ought
to
and
i
seized
him
by
the
nose
and
nearly
wrung
it
off
well
you
never
heerd
sich
a
shoutin
and
clappin
of
hands
and
cheerin
in
your
life
they
like
thunder
says
i
quirk
that
was
a
superb
joke
of
how
you
made
the
folks
larf
did
you
you
are
the
wittiest
critter
i
ever
seed
i
guess
you
mind
your
parts
o
speech
and
study
the
accidence
agin
afore
you
let
your
clapper
run
arter
that
fashion
wo
you
i
thought
said
i
that
among
you
republicans
there
were
no
gradations
of
rank
or
office
and
that
all
were
equal
the
and
the
governor
the
judge
and
the
crier
the
master
and
his
servant
and
although
from
the
natur
of
things
more
power
might
be
entrusted
to
one
than
the
other
yet
that
the
rank
of
all
was
precisely
the
same
well
said
he
it
is
so
in
theory
but
not
always
in
practice
and
when
we
do
practise
it
it
seems
to
go
a
little
agin
the
grain
as
if
it
war
quite
right
neither
when
i
was
last
to
baltimore
there
was
a
court
there
and
chief
justice
marshall
was
detailed
there
for
duty
well
with
us
in
new
england
the
sheriff
attends
the
judge
to
court
and
says
i
to
the
sheriff
do
you
escort
that
venerable
old
judge
to
the
state
house
he
a
credit
to
our
nation
that
man
he
actilly
the
first
pot
hook
on
the
crane
the
whole
weight
is
on
him
if
it
war
for
him
the
fat
would
be
in
the
fire
in
no
time
i
wonder
you
do
show
him
that
respect
it
hurt
you
one
morsel
i
guess
says
he
quite
miffy
like
he
know
the
way
to
court
as
well
as
i
do
if
i
thought
he
did
send
one
of
my
niggers
to
show
him
the
road
i
wonder
who
was
his
lackey
last
year
that
he
wants
me
to
be
this
time
it
convene
to
one
of
our
free
and
enlightened
citizens
to
tag
arter
any
man
that
a
fact
it
too
english
and
too
foreign
for
our
glorious
institutions
he
bound
by
law
to
be
there
at
ten
and
so
be
i
and
we
both
know
the
way
there
i
reckon
i
told
the
story
to
our
minister
hopewell
and
he
has
some
odd
notions
about
him
that
man
though
he
do
always
let
out
what
he
thinks
says
he
that
was
in
bad
taste
a
great
phrase
of
the
old
gentleman
that
bad
taste
sam
that
sheriff
was
a
goney
do
cut
your
cloth
arter
his
pattern
or
your
garment
become
you
i
tell
you
we
are
too
enlightened
to
worship
our
fellow
citizens
as
the
ancients
did
but
we
ought
to
pay
great
respect
to
vartue
and
exalted
talents
in
this
life
and
arter
their
death
there
should
be
statues
of
eminent
men
placed
in
our
national
temples
for
the
veneration
of
arter
ages
and
public
ceremonies
performed
annually
to
their
honour
arter
all
sam
said
he
and
he
made
a
considerable
of
a
long
pause
as
if
he
was
dubersome
whether
he
ought
to
speak
out
or
not
all
sam
said
he
ourselves
but
you
must
not
let
on
i
said
so
for
the
fullness
of
time
hai
yet
come
half
a
yard
of
blue
ribbon
is
a
plaguy
cheap
way
of
rewardin
merit
as
the
english
do
and
although
we
larf
at
for
folks
always
will
larf
at
what
they
hai
got
and
never
can
get
yet
titles
ai
bad
things
as
objects
of
ambition
are
they
then
tappin
me
on
the
shoulder
and
lookin
up
and
smilin
as
he
always
did
when
he
was
pleased
with
an
idee
samuel
slick
would
not
sound
bad
i
guess
would
it
sam
i
look
at
the
english
house
of
lords
said
he
see
so
much
larning
piety
talent
honour
vartue
and
refinement
collected
together
i
ax
myself
this
here
question
can
a
system
which
produces
and
sustains
such
a
body
of
men
as
the
world
never
saw
before
and
never
will
see
agin
be
defective
well
i
answer
myself
perhaps
it
is
for
all
human
institutions
are
so
but
i
guess
it
the
best
arter
all
it
would
do
here
now
sam
nor
perhaps
for
a
century
to
come
but
it
will
come
sooner
or
later
with
some
variations
now
the
newtown
pippin
when
transplanted
to
england
do
produce
such
fruit
as
it
does
in
long
island
and
english
fruits
do
preserve
their
flavour
here
neither
allowance
must
be
made
for
difference
of
soil
and
climate
oh
lord
thinks
i
if
he
turns
in
to
his
orchard
i
done
for
i
have
to
give
him
the
dodge
somehow
or
another
through
some
hole
in
the
fence
a
fact
but
he
passed
on
that
time
it
is
said
he
constitutions
will
gradually
approximate
to
and
to
as
they
lose
their
strength
of
executive
they
will
varge
to
republicanism
and
as
we
invigorate
the
form
of
government
as
we
must
do
or
go
to
the
old
boy
we
shall
tend
towards
a
monarchy
if
this
comes
on
gradually
like
the
changes
in
the
human
body
by
the
slow
approach
of
old
age
so
much
the
better
but
i
fear
we
shall
have
fevers
and
and
cholics
and
an
everlastin
gripin
of
the
intestines
first
you
and
i
wo
live
to
see
it
sam
but
our
posteriors
will
you
may
depend
i
do
go
the
whole
figur
with
minister
said
the
clockmaker
but
i
do
opinionate
with
him
in
part
in
our
business
relations
we
belie
our
political
principles
we
say
every
man
is
equal
in
the
union
and
should
have
an
equal
vote
and
voice
in
the
government
but
in
our
banks
railroad
companies
factory
corporations
and
so
on
every
man
vote
is
regilated
by
his
share
and
proportion
of
stock
and
if
it
war
so
no
man
would
take
hold
on
these
things
at
all
natur
ordained
it
so
a
father
of
a
family
is
head
and
rules
supreme
in
his
household
his
eldest
son
and
darter
are
like
first
leftenants
under
him
and
then
there
is
an
overseer
over
the
niggers
it
would
not
do
for
all
to
be
equal
there
so
it
is
in
the
univarse
it
is
ruled
by
one
superior
power
if
all
the
angels
had
a
voice
in
the
government
i
guess
here
i
fell
fast
asleep
i
had
been
nodding
for
some
time
not
in
approbation
of
what
he
said
but
in
heaviness
of
slumber
for
i
had
never
before
heard
him
so
prosy
since
i
first
overtook
him
on
the
colchester
road
i
hate
politics
as
a
subject
of
conversation
it
is
too
wide
a
field
for
and
too
often
ends
in
angry
discussion
how
long
he
continued
this
train
of
speculation
i
do
not
know
but
judging
by
the
different
aspect
of
the
country
i
must
have
slept
an
hour
i
was
at
length
aroused
by
the
report
of
his
rifle
which
he
had
discharged
from
the
wagon
the
last
i
recollected
of
his
conversation
was
i
think
about
american
angels
having
no
voice
in
the
government
an
assertion
that
struck
my
drowsy
faculties
as
not
strictly
true
as
i
had
often
heard
that
the
american
ladies
talked
frequently
and
warmly
on
the
subject
of
politics
and
knew
that
one
of
them
had
very
recently
the
credit
of
breaking
up
general
cabinet
when
i
awoke
the
first
i
heard
was
well
i
declare
if
that
ai
an
amazin
fine
shot
too
considerin
how
the
critter
was
the
whole
blessed
time
if
i
hai
cut
her
head
off
with
a
ball
jist
below
the
throat
that
a
fact
there
no
mistake
in
a
good
kentucky
rifle
i
tell
you
whose
head
said
i
in
great
alarm
whose
head
slick
for
heaven
sake
what
have
you
done
for
i
had
been
dreaming
of
those
angelic
politicians
the
american
ladies
why
that
head
to
be
sure
said
he
do
you
see
how
special
wonderful
wise
it
looks
about
arter
its
head
true
said
i
rubbing
my
eyes
and
opening
them
in
time
to
see
the
last
muscular
spasms
of
the
decapitated
body
true
slick
it
is
a
happy
illustration
of
our
previous
conversation
a
body
without
a
head
no
xxx
a
tale
of
bunker
hill
slick
like
all
his
countrymen
whom
i
have
seen
felt
that
his
own
existence
was
involved
in
that
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
that
it
was
his
duty
to
uphold
it
upon
all
occasions
he
affected
to
consider
its
government
and
its
institutions
as
perfect
and
if
any
doubt
was
suggested
as
to
the
stability
or
character
of
either
would
make
the
common
reply
of
all
americans
i
guess
you
do
understand
us
or
else
enter
into
a
laboured
defence
when
left
however
to
the
free
expression
of
his
own
thoughts
he
would
often
give
utterance
to
those
apprehensions
which
most
men
feel
in
the
event
of
an
experiment
not
yet
fairly
tried
and
which
has
in
many
parts
evidently
disappointed
the
sanguine
hopes
of
its
friends
but
even
on
these
occasions
when
his
vigilance
seemed
to
slumber
he
would
generally
cover
them
by
giving
them
as
the
remarks
of
others
or
concealing
them
in
a
tale
it
was
this
habit
that
gave
his
discourse
rather
the
appearance
of
thinking
aloud
than
a
connected
conversation
we
are
a
great
nation
squire
he
said
that
sartain
but
afeard
we
did
altogether
start
right
it
in
politics
as
in
racin
everything
depends
upon
a
fair
start
if
you
are
off
too
quick
you
have
to
pull
up
and
turn
back
agin
and
your
beast
gets
out
of
wind
and
is
baffled
and
if
you
lose
in
the
start
you
got
a
fair
chance
arterwards
and
are
plaguy
apt
to
be
jockied
in
the
course
when
we
set
up
as
it
were
for
ourselves
we
hated
our
stepmother
old
england
so
dreadful
bad
we
foller
any
of
her
ways
of
managin
at
all
but
made
new
receipts
for
ourselves
well
we
missed
it
in
many
things
most
consumedly
somehow
or
another
did
you
ever
see
said
he
a
congregation
split
right
in
two
by
a
quarrel
and
one
part
go
off
and
set
up
for
themselves
i
am
sorry
to
say
said
i
that
i
have
seen
some
melancholy
instances
of
the
kind
well
they
shoot
ahead
or
drop
astern
as
the
case
may
be
but
they
soon
get
on
another
tack
and
leave
the
old
ship
clean
out
of
sight
when
folks
once
take
to
emigratin
in
religion
in
this
way
they
never
know
where
to
bide
first
they
try
one
location
and
then
they
try
another
some
settle
here
and
some
improve
there
but
they
hitch
their
horses
together
long
some
times
they
complain
they
have
too
little
water
at
other
times
that
they
have
too
much
they
are
never
satisfied
and
wherever
these
separatists
go
they
onsettle
others
as
bad
as
themselves
i
never
look
on
a
desarter
as
any
great
shakes
my
poor
father
used
to
say
mind
what
i
tell
you
if
a
man
do
agree
in
all
particulars
with
his
church
and
ca
go
the
whole
hog
with
he
ai
justified
on
that
account
no
how
to
separate
from
them
for
sam
schism
is
a
sin
in
the
eye
of
god
the
whole
christian
world
he
would
say
divided
into
two
great
families
the
catholic
and
protestant
well
the
catholic
is
a
united
family
a
happy
family
and
a
strong
family
all
governed
by
one
head
and
sam
as
sure
as
eggs
is
eggs
that
family
will
grub
out
one
stalk
branch
and
root
it
wo
so
much
as
leave
the
seed
of
it
in
the
ground
to
grow
by
chance
as
a
nateral
curiosity
now
the
protestant
family
is
like
a
bundle
of
refuse
shingles
when
withed
up
together
which
it
never
was
and
never
will
be
to
all
etarnity
no
great
of
a
bundle
arter
all
you
might
take
it
up
under
one
arm
and
walk
off
with
it
without
winkin
but
when
all
lyin
loose
as
it
always
is
jist
look
at
it
and
see
what
a
sight
it
is
all
blowin
about
by
every
wind
of
doctrine
some
away
up
out
of
sight
others
rollin
over
and
over
in
the
dirt
some
split
to
pieces
and
others
so
warped
by
the
weather
and
cracked
by
the
sun
no
two
of
will
lie
so
as
to
make
a
close
they
are
all
divided
into
sects
railin
quarrellin
separatin
and
agreein
in
nothin
but
hatin
each
other
it
is
awful
to
think
on
family
will
some
day
or
other
gather
them
all
up
put
them
into
a
bundle
and
bind
them
up
tight
and
condemn
as
fit
for
nothin
under
the
sun
but
the
fire
now
he
who
splits
one
of
these
here
sects
by
schism
or
he
who
preaches
schism
commits
a
grievous
sin
and
sam
if
you
vally
your
own
peace
of
mind
have
nothin
to
do
with
such
folks
pretty
much
the
same
in
politics
i
ai
quite
clear
in
my
conscience
sam
about
our
glorious
revolution
if
that
blood
was
shed
justly
in
the
rebellion
then
it
was
the
lord
doin
but
if
unlawfully
how
am
i
to
answer
for
my
share
in
it
i
was
at
bunker
hill
the
most
splendid
battle
it
generally
allowed
that
ever
was
fought
what
effect
my
shots
had
i
ca
tell
and
i
am
glad
i
ca
all
except
one
sam
and
that
shot
here
the
old
gentleman
became
dreadful
agitated
he
shook
like
an
ague
fit
and
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
and
wrung
his
hands
and
groaned
bitterly
have
wrastled
with
the
lord
sam
and
have
prayed
to
him
to
enlighten
me
on
that
and
to
wash
out
the
stain
of
that
blood
from
my
hands
i
never
told
you
that
story
nor
your
mother
neither
for
she
could
not
stand
it
poor
critter
kinder
narvous
doctor
warren
the
first
soldier
of
his
age
though
he
never
fought
afore
commanded
us
all
to
resarve
our
fire
till
the
british
came
within
shot
and
we
could
cleverly
see
the
whites
of
their
eyes
and
we
did
so
and
we
mowed
them
down
like
grass
and
we
repeated
our
fire
with
awful
effect
i
was
among
the
last
that
remained
behind
the
for
most
on
arter
the
second
shot
cut
and
run
full
split
the
british
were
close
to
us
and
an
officer
with
his
sword
drawn
was
leading
on
his
men
and
encouragin
them
to
the
charge
i
could
see
his
features
he
was
a
real
handsum
man
i
can
see
him
now
with
his
white
breeches
and
black
gaiters
and
red
coat
and
cocked
hat
as
plain
as
if
it
was
yesterday
instead
of
the
year
well
i
took
a
steady
aim
at
him
and
fired
he
did
move
for
a
space
and
i
thought
i
had
missed
him
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
sprung
right
straight
up
an
eend
his
sword
slipped
through
his
hands
up
to
the
and
then
he
fell
flat
on
his
face
atop
of
the
blade
and
it
came
straight
out
through
his
back
he
was
fairly
skivered
i
never
seed
anything
so
awful
since
i
was
raised
i
actilly
screamed
out
with
horror
and
i
threw
away
my
gun
and
joined
them
that
were
retreatin
over
the
neck
to
charlestown
sam
that
british
officer
if
our
rebellion
was
onjust
or
onlawful
was
murdered
that
a
fact
and
the
idee
now
i
am
growin
old
haunts
me
day
and
night
sometimes
i
begin
with
the
stamp
act
and
i
go
over
all
our
grievances
one
by
one
and
say
ai
they
a
sufficient
justification
well
it
makes
a
long
list
and
i
get
kinder
satisfied
and
it
appears
as
clear
as
anything
but
sometimes
there
come
doubts
in
my
mind
jist
like
a
guest
that
not
invited
or
not
expected
and
takes
you
at
a
short
like
and
i
say
war
the
stamp
act
repealed
and
concessions
made
and
offers
sent
to
settle
all
fairly
and
i
get
troubled
and
oneasy
agin
and
then
i
say
to
myself
says
i
oh
yes
but
them
offers
came
too
late
i
do
nothin
now
when
i
am
alone
but
argue
it
over
and
over
agin
i
actilly
dream
on
that
man
in
my
sleep
sometimes
and
then
i
see
him
as
plain
as
if
he
was
afore
me
and
i
go
over
it
all
agin
till
i
come
to
that
shot
and
then
i
leap
right
up
in
bed
and
scream
like
all
vengeance
and
your
mother
poor
old
critter
says
sam
says
she
what
on
airth
ails
you
to
make
you
act
so
like
old
scratch
in
your
sleep
i
do
believe
there
somethin
or
another
on
your
conscience
and
i
say
polly
dear
i
guess
we
to
have
rain
for
that
plaguy
cute
rheumatis
has
seized
my
foot
and
it
does
antagonize
me
so
i
have
no
peace
it
always
does
so
when
like
for
a
change
dear
heart
she
says
the
poor
simple
critter
then
i
guess
i
had
better
rub
it
had
i
sam
and
she
crawls
out
of
bed
and
gets
her
red
flannel
petticoat
and
rubs
away
at
my
foot
ever
so
long
oh
sam
if
she
could
rub
it
out
of
my
heart
as
easy
as
she
thinks
she
rubs
it
out
of
my
foot
i
should
be
in
peace
that
a
fact
done
sam
ca
be
helped
there
is
no
use
in
cryin
over
spilt
milk
but
still
one
ca
help
on
it
but
i
love
schisms
and
i
do
love
rebellion
revolution
has
made
us
grow
faster
and
grow
richer
but
sam
when
we
were
younger
and
poorer
we
were
more
pious
and
more
happy
we
have
nothin
fixed
either
in
religion
or
politics
what
connection
there
ought
to
be
atween
church
and
state
i
am
not
availed
but
some
there
ought
to
be
as
sure
as
the
lord
made
moses
religion
when
left
to
itself
as
with
us
grows
too
rank
and
luxuriant
suckers
and
sprouts
and
intersecting
shoots
and
superfluous
wood
make
a
nice
shady
tree
to
look
at
but
where
the
fruit
sam
that
the
question
where
the
fruit
no
the
pride
of
human
wisdom
and
the
presumption
it
breeds
will
ruinate
us
jefferson
was
an
infidel
and
avowed
it
and
gloried
in
it
and
called
it
the
enlightenment
of
the
age
cambridge
college
is
unitarian
it
looks
wise
to
doubt
and
every
drumstick
of
a
boy
ridicules
the
belief
of
his
forefathers
if
our
country
is
to
be
darkened
by
infidelity
our
government
defied
by
every
state
and
every
state
ruled
by
mobs
then
sam
the
blood
we
shed
in
our
revolution
will
be
atoned
for
in
the
blood
and
suffering
of
our
fellow
citizens
the
murders
of
that
civil
war
will
be
expiated
by
a
political
suicide
of
the
state
i
am
somewhat
of
father
opinion
said
the
clockmaker
though
i
do
go
the
whole
figur
with
him
but
he
need
have
made
such
an
everlastin
touss
about
fixin
that
british
officer
flint
for
him
for
he
a
died
of
himself
by
this
time
i
do
suppose
if
he
had
a
missed
his
shot
at
him
we
might
have
done
a
little
better
and
we
might
by
stickin
a
little
closer
to
the
old
constitution
but
one
thing
i
will
say
i
think
arter
all
your
colony
government
is
about
as
happy
and
as
a
good
a
one
as
i
know
on
a
man
life
and
property
are
well
protected
here
at
little
cost
and
he
can
go
where
he
likes
and
do
what
he
likes
provided
he
trespass
on
his
neighbour
i
guess
that
enough
for
any
on
us
now
ai
it
no
xxxi

he

the
richest

in

and
then
his
bread
is
buttered
on
both
sides
he
promised
too
much
then
comes
a

well
he
turns
stomach
and
pocket
both
inside
out
and
leaves
poor
bluenose
a
dead
man
he
promised
too
much
then
comes
a
lawyer
an
honest
lawyer
too
a
real
wonder
under
the
sun
as
straight
as
a
shingle
in
all
his
dealin
he
so
honest
he
ca
bear
to
hear
tell
of
other
lawyers
he
writes
agin
raves
agin
votes
agin
they
are
all
rogues
but
him
he
jist
the
man
to
take
a
case
in
hand
he
will
see
justice
done
well
he
wins
his
case
and
fobs
all
for
costs
he
sworn
to
see
justice
done
to
himself
he
promised
too
much
then
comes
a
yankee
clockmaker
and
here
slick
looked
up
and
smiled
with
his
sawder
and
natur
and
he
sells
clocks
warranted
to
run
from
july
to
etarnity
stoppages
included
and
i
must
say
they
do
run
as
long
as
as
long
as
wooden
clocks
commonly
do
that
a
fact
but
i
show
you
presently
how
i
put
the
leak
into
for
here
a
feller
a
little
bit
ahead
on
us
whose
flint
i
made
up
my
mind
to
fix
this
while
past
here
we
were
nearly
thrown
out
of
the
wagon
by
the
breaking
down
of
one
of
those
small
wooden
bridges
which
prove
so
annoying
and
so
dangerous
to
travellers
did
you
hear
that
snap
said
he
well
as
sure
as
fate
i
break
my
clocks
over
them
etarnal
log
bridges
if
old
clay
clips
over
them
arter
that
fashion
them
poles
are
plaguy
treacherous
they
are
jist
like
old
marm
patience
doesgood
teeth
that
keeps
the
great
united
independent
democratic
hotel
at
squaw
neck
creek
in
massachusetts
one
half
gone
and
half
rotten
eends
i
thought
you
had
disposed
of
your
last
clock
said
i
at
colchester
to
deacon
flint
so
i
did
he
replied
the
last
one
i
had
to
sell
to
him
but
i
got
a
few
left
for
other
folks
yet
now
there
is
a
man
on
this
road
one
zeb
allen
a
real
genuine
skinflint
a
proper
customer
as
you
see
anywhere
and
one
that
not
altogether
the
straight
thing
in
his
dealin
neither
he
do
want
no
one
to
live
but
himself
and
he
mighty
handsum
to
me
sayin
my
clocks
are
all
a
cheat
and
that
we
ruinate
the
country
every
drop
of
money
out
of
it
me
a
yankee
broom
and
what
not
but
it
ai
all
jist
gospel
that
he
says
now
i
put
a
clock
on
him
afore
he
knows
it
i
go
right
into
him
as
slick
as
a
whistle
and
play
him
to
the
eend
of
my
line
like
a
trout
i
have
a
hook
in
his
gills
while
he
he
only
smellin
at
the
bait
there
he
is
now
i
be
darned
if
he
ai
standin
afore
his
shop
door
lookin
as
strong
as
high
proof
jamaiky
i
guess
i
whip
it
out
the
bung
while
he
arter
the
spicket
and
he
be
none
o
the
wiser
till
he
finds
it
out
neither
well
squire
how
do
you
do
said
he
how
all
at
home
reasonable
well
i
give
you
thanks
wo
you
alight
ca
today
said
slick
i
in
a
considerable
of
a
hurry
to
katch
the
packet
have
you
any
commands
for
i
goin
to
the
island
and
across
the
bay
to
windsor
any
word
that
way
no
says
allen
none
that
i
can
think
on
unless
it
be
to
enquire
how
butter
goin
they
tell
me
cheese
is
down
and
produce
of
all
kind
particular
dull
this
fall
well
i
glad
i
can
tell
you
that
question
said
slick
for
i
do
calculate
to
return
to
these
parts
butter
is
risin
a
cent
or
two
i
put
mine
off
mind
at
tenpence
do
return
possible
why
how
you
talk
have
you
done
with
the
clock
trade
i
guess
i
have
it
ai
worth
follerin
now
most
time
said
the
other
laughing
for
by
all
accounts
the
clocks
war
worth
havin
and
most
infarnal
dear
too
folks
begin
to
get
their
eyes
open
it
war
needed
in
your
case
said
slick
with
that
peculiarly
composed
manner
that
indicates
suppressed
feeling
for
you
were
always
wide
awake
if
all
the
folks
had
cut
their
as
airly
as
you
did
their
be
plaguy
few
clocks
sold
in
these
parts
i
reckon
but
you
are
right
squire
you
may
say
that
they
actilly
were
not
worth
havin
and
that
the
truth
the
fact
is
said
he
throwing
down
his
reins
and
affecting
a
most
confidential
tone
i
felt
almost
ashamed
of
them
myself
i
tell
you
the
long
and
short
of
the
matter
is
jist
this
they
do
make
no
good
ones
nowadays
no
more
for
they
calculate
for
shippin
and
not
for
home
use
i
was
all
struck
up
of
a
heap
when
i
seed
the
last
lot
i
got
from
the
states
i
was
properly
bit
by
them
you
may
depend
they
did
pay
cost
for
i
could
recommend
them
with
a
clear
conscience
and
i
must
say
i
do
like
a
fair
deal
for
i
strait
up
and
down
and
love
to
go
right
ahead
that
a
fact
did
you
ever
see
them
i
fetched
when
i
first
came
them
i
sold
over
the
bay
no
said
allen
i
ca
say
i
did
well
continued
he
they
were
a
prime
article
i
tell
you
no
mistake
there
fit
for
any
market
it
generally
allowed
there
the
beat
of
them
to
be
found
anywhere
if
you
want
a
clock
and
can
lay
your
hands
on
one
of
them
i
advise
you
not
to
let
go
the
chance
you
know
by
the
mark
for
they
were
all
made
at
judge
beler
factory
squire
shepody
down
to
five
islands
axed
me
to
get
him
one
and
a
special
job
i
had
of
it
near
about
more
sarch
arter
it
than
it
was
worth
but
i
did
get
him
one
and
a
particular
handsome
one
it
is
copal
and
gilt
superior
i
guess
it
worth
ary
half
dozen
in
these
parts
let
be
where
they
may
if
i
could
a
got
supplied
with
the
like
o
them
i
could
a
made
a
grand
spec
out
of
them
for
they
took
at
once
and
went
off
quick
have
you
got
it
with
you
said
allen
i
should
like
to
see
it
yes
i
have
it
here
all
done
up
in
tow
as
snug
as
a
bird
egg
to
keep
it
from
jarrin
for
it
hurts
consumedly
to
jolt
over
them
etarnal
wooden
bridges
but
it
no
use
to
take
it
out
it
ai
for
sale
it
bespoke
and
i
would
take
the
same
trouble
to
get
another
for
twenty
dollars
the
only
one
that
i
know
of
that
there
any
chance
of
gettin
is
one
that
increase
crane
has
up
to
wilmot
they
say
he
off
after
a
good
deal
of
persuasion
slick
unpacked
the
clock
but
protested
against
his
asking
for
it
for
it
was
not
for
sale
it
was
then
exhibited
every
part
explained
and
praised
as
new
in
invention
and
perfect
in
workmanship
now
allen
had
a
very
exalted
opinion
of
squire
shepody
taste
judgment
and
saving
knowledge
and
as
it
was
the
last
and
only
chance
of
getting
a
clock
of
such
superior
quality
he
offered
to
take
it
at
the
price
the
squire
was
to
have
it
at
seven
pounds
ten
shillings
but
slick
vowed
he
part
with
it
at
no
rate
he
did
know
where
he
could
get
the
like
agin
for
he
war
quite
sure
about
increase
crane
and
the
squire
would
be
confounded
disappointed
he
could
think
of
it
in
proportion
to
the
difficulties
rose
the
ardour
of
allen
his
offers
advanced
to
eight
pounds
to
eight
pounds
ten
shillings
to
nine
pounds
i
vow
said
slick
i
wish
i
had
let
on
that
i
had
it
at
all
i
do
like
to
refuse
you
but
where
am
i
to
get
the
like
after
much
discussion
of
a
similar
nature
he
consented
to
part
with
the
clock
though
with
great
apparent
reluctance
and
pocketed
the
money
with
a
protest
that
cost
what
it
would
he
should
have
to
procure
another
for
he
could
think
of
putting
the
squire
pipe
out
arter
that
fashion
for
he
was
a
very
clever
man
and
as
fair
as
a
boot
jack
now
said
slick
as
we
proceeded
on
our
way
that
feller
is
properly
sarved
he
got
the
most
inferior
article
i
had
and
i
jist
doubled
the
price
on
him
it
a
pity
he
should
be
of
lies
of
the
yankees
all
the
time
this
will
help
him
now
to
a
little
grain
of
truth
then
mimicking
his
voice
and
manner
he
repeated
allen
words
with
a
strong
nasal
twang
time
for
you
to
give
over
the
clock
trade
i
guess
for
by
all
accounts
they
ai
worth
havin
and
most
infarnel
dear
too
folks
begin
to
get
their
eyes
open
better
for
you
if
you
a
had
open
i
reckon
a
joke
is
a
joke
but
i
consait
you
find
that
no
joke
the
next
time
you
tell
stories
about
yankee
peddlers
put
the
wooden
clock
in
with
the
wooden
punkin
seeds
and
hickory
hams
will
you
the
bluenoses
squire
are
all
like
zeb
allen
they
think
they
know
everything
but
they
get
gulled
from
year
eend
to
year
eend
they
expect
too
much
from
others
and
do
too
little
for
themselves
they
actilly
expect
the
sun
to
shine
and
the
rain
to
fall
through
their
little
house
of
assembly
have
you
done
for
us
they
keep
axin
their
members
did
you
spunk
up
to
last
session
jist
as
if
all
legislation
consisted
in
attackin
some
half
dozen
puss
proud
folks
at
halifax
who
are
jist
as
big
noodles
as
they
be
themselves
you
hear
but
politics
politics
politics
one
everlastin
sound
of
give
give
give
if
i
was
governor
i
give
the
butt
eend
of
my
mind
on
the
subject
i
crack
their
pates
till
i
let
some
light
in
if
it
was
me
i
know
i
say
to
the
members
do
come
down
here
to
halifax
with
your
long
lockrums
about
politics
makin
a
great
touss
about
nothin
but
open
the
country
foster
agricultur
encourage
trade
incorporate
companies
make
bridges
facilitate
conveyance
and
above
all
things
make
a
railroad
from
windsor
to
halifax
and
mind
what
i
tell
you
now
write
it
down
for
fear
you
should
forget
it
for
it
a
fact
and
if
you
do
believe
me
i
lick
you
till
you
do
for
there
ai
a
word
of
a
lie
in
it
by
gum
one
such
work
as
the
windsor
bridge
is
worth
all
your
laws
votes
speeches
and
resolutions
for
the
last
ten
years
if
tied
up
and
put
into
a
meal
bag
together
if
it
ai
i
hope
i
may
be
shot
no
xxxii
too
many
irons
in
the
fire
we
had
a
pleasant
sail
of
three
hours
from
parrsboro
to
windsor
the
arrivals
and
departures
by
water
are
regulated
at
this
place
by
the
tide
and
it
was
sunset
before
we
reached
wilcox
comfortable
inn
here
as
at
other
places
slick
seemed
to
be
perfectly
at
home
and
he
pointed
to
a
wooden
clock
as
a
proof
of
his
successful
and
extended
trade
and
of
the
universal
influence
of
soft
sawder
and
a
knowledge
of
human
natur
taking
out
a
pen
knife
he
cut
off
a
splinter
from
a
stick
of
firewood
and
balancing
himself
on
one
leg
of
his
chair
by
the
aid
of
his
right
foot
commenced
his
favourite
amusement
of
whitling
which
he
generally
pursued
in
silence
indeed
it
appeared
to
have
become
with
him
an
indispensible
accompaniment
of
reflection
he
sat
in
this
abstracted
manner
until
he
had
manufactured
into
delicate
shavings
the
whole
of
his
raw
materiel
when
he
very
deliberately
resumed
a
position
of
more
ease
and
security
by
resting
his
chair
on
two
legs
instead
of
one
and
putting
both
his
feet
on
the
mantel
piece
then
lighting
his
cigar
he
said
in
his
usual
quiet
manner
there
a
plaguy
sight
of
truth
in
them
old
proverbs
they
are
distilled
facts
steamed
down
to
an
essence
they
are
like
portable
soup
an
amazin
deal
of
matter
in
a
small
compass
they
are
what
i
vally
most
experience
father
used
to
say
as
lives
have
an
old
homespun
doctor
as
ary
a
professor
in
the
college
at
philadelphia
or
new
york
to
attend
me
for
what
they
do
know
they
know
by
experience
and
not
by
books
and
experience
is
everything
it
hearin
and
seein
and
tryin
and
arter
that
a
feller
must
be
a
born
fool
if
he
do
know
that
the
beauty
of
old
proverbs
they
are
as
true
as
a
plum
line
and
as
short
and
sweet
as
sugar
candy
now
when
you
come
to
see
all
about
this
country
you
find
the
truth
of
that
one
man
that
has
too
many
irons
in
the
fire
is
plaguy
apt
to
get
some
on
burnt
do
you
recollect
that
tree
i
show
you
to
parrsboro
it
was
all
covered
with
black
knobs
like
a
wart
rubbed
with
caustic
well
the
plum
trees
had
the
same
disease
a
few
years
ago
and
they
all
died
and
the
cherry
trees
i
consait
will
go
for
it
too
the
farms
here
are
all
covered
with
the
same
knobs
and
they
do
look
like
old
scratch
if
you
see
a
place
all
gone
to
wrack
and
ruin
its
mortgaged
you
may
depend
the
knob
is
on
it
my
plan
you
know
is
to
ax
leave
to
put
a
clock
in
a
house
and
let
it
be
till
i
return
i
never
say
a
word
about
sellin
it
for
i
know
when
i
come
back
they
wo
let
it
go
arter
they
are
once
used
to
it
well
when
i
first
came
i
knowed
no
one
and
i
was
forced
to
enquire
whether
a
man
was
good
for
it
afore
i
left
it
with
him
so
i
made
a
of
axin
all
about
every
man
place
that
lived
on
the
road
lives
up
there
in
the
big
house
says
i
a
nice
location
that
pretty
considerable
improvements
them
sir
that
a
b
he
was
well
to
do
in
the
world
once
carried
a
stiff
upper
lip
and
keerd
for
no
one
he
was
one
of
our
grand
aristocrats
wore
a
long
tailed
coat
and
a
ruffled
shirt
but
he
must
take
to
ship
buildin
and
has
gone
to
the
dogs
said
i
many
irons
in
the
fire
well
the
next
farm
where
the
pigs
are
in
the
potato
field
whose
is
that
sir
that
d
he
was
a
considerable
farmer
as
any
in
our
place
but
he
sot
up
for
an
and
opened
a
store
and
things
went
agin
him
somehow
he
had
no
luck
arterwards
i
hear
his
place
is
mortgaged
and
they
got
him
cited
in
chancery
black
knob
is
on
him
said
i
black
what
sir
says
bluenose
says
i
the
next
who
improves
that
house
that
he
was
the
greatest
farmer
in
these
parts
another
of
the
aristocracy
had
a
most
a
noble
stock
cattle
and
the
matter
of
some
hundreds
out
in
notes
well
he
took
the
contract
for
beef
with
the
troops
and
he
fell
astarn
so
i
guess
it
a
gone
goose
with
him
he
heavy
mortgaged
many
irons
agin
said
i
lives
to
the
left
there
that
man
has
a
most
a
special
fine
interval
and
a
grand
orchard
too
he
must
be
a
good
mark
that
he
was
once
sir
a
few
years
ago
but
he
built
a
fullin
mill
and
a
cardin
mill
and
put
up
a
lumber
establishment
and
speculated
in
the
west
indy
line
but
the
dam
was
carried
away
by
the
freshets
the
lumber
fell
and
faith
he
fell
too
he
shot
up
he
hai
been
seed
these
two
years
his
farm
is
a
common
and
fairly
run
out
said
i
understand
now
my
man
these
folks
had
too
many
irons
in
the
fire
you
see
and
some
on
have
got
burnt
never
heerd
tell
of
it
says
bluenose
might
but
not
to
my
knowledge
and
he
scratched
his
head
and
looked
as
if
he
would
ask
the
meanin
of
it
but
did
like
too
arter
that
i
axed
no
more
questions
i
knew
a
mortgaged
farm
as
far
as
i
could
see
it
there
was
a
strong
family
likeness
in
all
the
same
ugly
features
the
same
cast
o
countenance
the
black
knob
was
discernible
there
was
no
mistake
barn
doors
broken
off
fences
burnt
up
glass
out
of
windows
more
white
crops
than
green
and
both
lookin
poor
and
weedy
no
wood
pile
no
sarse
garden
no
compost
no
stock
moss
in
the
mowin
lands
thistles
in
the
ploughed
lands
and
neglect
every
where
skinnin
had
commenced
takin
all
out
and
puttin
nothin
in
gittin
ready
for
a
move
so
as
to
have
behind
flittin
time
had
come
foregatherin
for
foreclosin
preparin
to
curse
and
quit
that
beautiful
river
we
came
up
today
what
superfine
farms
it
has
on
both
sides
of
it
hai
it
it
a
sight
to
behold
our
folks
have
no
notion
of
such
a
country
so
far
down
east
beyond
creation
most
as
nova
scotia
is
if
i
was
to
draw
up
an
account
of
it
for
the
slickville
gazette
i
guess
few
would
accept
it
as
a
bona
fide
draft
without
some
man
to
indorse
it
that
war
given
to
flammin
they
say
there
was
a
land
speculation
to
the
bottom
of
it
or
water
privilege
to
put
into
the
market
or
a
plaister
rock
to
get
off
or
some
such
scheme
they
would
i
snore
but
i
hope
i
may
never
see
daylight
agin
if
sich
a
country
in
all
our
great
nation
as
the
of
windsor
now
it
jist
as
like
as
not
some
goney
of
a
bluenose
that
seed
us
from
his
fields
sailin
up
full
split
with
a
fair
wind
on
the
packet
went
right
off
home
and
said
to
his
wife
do
for
gracious
sake
mother
jist
look
here
and
see
how
slick
them
folks
go
along
and
that
captain
has
nothin
to
do
all
day
but
sit
straddle
legs
across
his
tiller
and
order
about
his
sailors
or
talk
like
a
gentleman
to
his
passengers
he
got
most
as
easy
a
time
of
it
as
ami
cuttle
has
since
he
took
up
the
fur
trade
rabbits
i
guess
i
buy
a
vessel
and
leave
the
lads
to
do
the
ploughin
and
little
chores
they
growed
up
now
to
be
considerable
lumps
of
boys
well
away
he
go
hot
foot
for
i
know
the
critters
better
nor
they
know
themselves
and
he
go
and
buy
some
old
wrack
of
a
vessel
to
carry
plaister
and
mortgage
his
farm
to
pay
for
her
the
vessel
will
jam
him
up
tight
for
repairs
and
new
riggin
and
the
sheriff
will
soon
pay
him
a
visit
and
he
a
most
particular
troublesome
visitor
that
if
he
once
only
gets
a
slight
d
acquaintance
he
becomes
so
amazin
intimate
arterwards
in
without
knockin
and
in
and
out
at
all
hours
and
makin
so
plaguy
free
and
easy
it
about
as
much
as
a
bargain
if
you
can
get
clear
of
him
afterwards
benipt
by
the
tide
and
benipt
by
the
sheriff
the
vessel
makes
short
work
with
him
well
the
upshot
is
the
farm
gets
neglected
while
captain
cuddy
is
to
sea
of
plaister
the
thistles
run
over
his
grain
fields
his
cattle
run
over
his
hay
land
the
interest
runs
over
its
time
the
mortgage
runs
over
all
and
at
last
he
jist
runs
over
to
the
lines
to
eastport
himself
and
when
he
finds
himself
there
in
the
street
near
major
pine
tavern
with
his
hands
in
his
trouser
pockets
of
a
stray
shillin
from
one
eend
of
to
another
afore
he
can
catch
it
to
swap
for
a
dinner
wo
he
look
like
a
ravin
distracted
fool
that
all
he
feel
about
as
streaked
as
i
did
once
down
the
john
river
it
was
the
fore
part
of
march
i
been
up
to
fredericton
in
a
small
matter
of
lumber
and
was
returnin
to
the
city
along
on
one
of
old
buntin
horses
on
the
ice
and
all
at
one
i
missed
my
horse
he
went
right
slap
in
and
slid
under
the
ice
out
of
sight
as
quick
as
wink
and
there
i
was
all
alone
well
says
i
what
the
dogs
has
become
of
my
horse
and
port
mantle
they
have
given
me
a
proper
dodge
that
a
fact
that
is
a
narrer
squeak
it
fairly
bangs
all
well
i
guess
he
feel
near
about
as
ugly
when
he
finds
himself
brought
up
all
standin
that
way
and
it
will
come
so
sudden
on
him
he
say
why
it
ai
possible
i
lost
farm
and
vessel
both
in
tu
tu
that
way
but
i
do
see
neither
on
eastport
is
near
about
all
made
up
of
folks
who
have
had
to
cut
and
run
for
it
i
was
down
there
last
fall
and
who
should
i
see
but
thomas
rigby
of
windsor
he
knew
me
the
minit
he
laid
eyes
upon
me
for
i
had
sold
him
a
clock
the
summer
afore
i
got
paid
for
it
though
for
i
seed
he
had
too
many
irons
in
the
fire
not
to
get
some
on
burnt
and
besides
i
knew
every
fall
and
spring
the
wind
set
in
for
the
lines
from
windsor
very
strong
a
regular
trade
wind
a
sort
of
monshune
that
blows
all
one
way
for
a
long
time
without
shiftin
well
i
felt
proper
sorry
for
him
for
he
was
a
very
clever
man
and
looked
cut
up
dreadfully
and
amazin
down
in
the
mouth
says
i
is
that
you
rigby
why
as
i
am
alive
if
that
my
old
friend
why
how
do
you
do
i
thank
you
said
he
be
you
well
i
give
you
thanks
says
i
what
on
airth
brought
you
here
says
he
slick
i
well
avoid
it
times
are
uncommon
dull
over
the
bay
there
stirrin
there
this
year
and
never
will
i
thinkin
no
mortal
soul
can
live
in
nova
scotia
i
do
believe
that
our
country
was
made
of
a
sunday
night
arter
all
the
rest
of
the
univarse
was
finished
one
half
of
it
has
got
all
the
ballast
of
noah
ark
thrown
out
there
and
the
other
half
is
eat
up
by
bankers
lawyers
and
other
great
folks
all
our
money
goes
to
pay
salaries
and
a
poor
man
has
no
chance
at
all
says
i
you
done
up
stock
and
fluke
a
total
wrack
says
he
have
two
hundred
pounds
left
yet
to
the
good
but
my
farm
stock
and
utensils
them
young
blood
horses
and
the
bran
new
vessel
i
was
are
all
gone
to
pot
swept
as
clean
as
a
thrashin
floor
that
a
fact
shark
and
took
all
says
i
you
know
the
reason
of
all
that
misfortin
says
he
fool
can
tell
that
bad
times
to
be
sure
everything
has
turned
agin
the
country
the
banks
have
it
all
their
own
way
and
much
good
may
it
do
says
i
the
reason
the
banks
do
eat
us
up
too
for
i
guess
they
are
as
hungry
as
be
and
no
way
particular
about
their
food
neither
considerable
sharp
set
cut
like
razors
you
may
depend
i
tell
you
says
i
you
get
that
slide
that
sent
you
heels
over
head
you
had
too
many
irons
in
the
fire
you
had
ought
to
have
taken
hold
of
ship
buildin
at
all
you
knowed
nothin
about
it
you
should
have
stuck
to
your
farm
and
your
farm
would
have
stuck
to
you
now
go
back
afore
you
spend
your
money
go
up
to
douglas
and
you
buy
as
good
a
farm
for
two
hundred
pounds
as
what
you
lost
and
see
to
that
and
to
that
only
and
you
grow
rich
as
for
banks
they
ca
hurt
a
country
no
great
i
guess
except
by
breakin
and
i
conceit
there
no
fear
of
breakin
and
as
for
lawyers
and
them
kind
o
heavy
coaches
give
half
the
road
and
if
they
run
agin
you
take
the
law
of
undivided
attention
paid
to
one
thing
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
will
ensure
success
but
you
know
the
old
sayin
about
too
many
irons
says
i
rigby
what
is
it
says
he
moon
is
up
a
piece
i
guess
it
seven
or
thereabouts
i
suppose
it
time
to
be
says
i
come
with
me
i
got
a
real
nateral
curiosity
to
show
you
such
a
thing
as
you
never
laid
your
eyes
on
in
nova
scotia
i
know
so
we
walked
along
towards
the
beach
says
i
at
that
man
old
lunar
and
his
son
plank
by
moonlight
for
that
vessel
on
the
stocks
there
come
agin
tomorrow
mornin
afore
you
can
cleverly
discarn
objects
the
matter
of
a
yard
or
so
afore
you
and
find
at
it
agin
i
guess
that
vessel
wo
ruinate
those
folks
they
know
their
business
and
stick
to
it
well
away
went
rigby
considerably
sulky
for
he
had
no
notion
that
it
was
his
own
fault
he
laid
all
the
blame
on
the
folks
to
halifax
but
i
guess
he
was
a
little
grain
posed
for
back
he
went
and
bought
to
sowack
where
i
hear
he
has
a
better
farm
than
he
had
afore
i
mind
once
we
had
an
irish
gal
as
a
dairy
help
well
we
had
a
wicked
devil
of
a
cow
and
she
kicked
over
the
milk
pail
and
in
ran
dora
and
swore
the
bogle
did
it
jist
so
poor
rigby
he
allow
it
was
nateral
causes
but
laid
it
all
to
politics
of
dora
puts
me
in
mind
of
the
gals
for
she
war
a
heifer
that
my
what
an
eye
she
had
and
i
consaited
she
had
a
particular
small
foot
and
ankle
too
when
i
helped
her
up
once
into
the
hay
mow
to
sarch
for
eggs
but
i
ca
exactly
say
for
when
she
brought
in
mother
shook
her
head
and
said
it
was
dangerous
she
said
she
might
fall
through
and
hurt
herself
and
always
sent
old
snow
afterwards
she
was
a
considerable
of
a
woman
was
mother
she
could
see
as
far
ahead
as
most
folks
she
born
yesterday
i
guess
but
that
proverb
is
true
as
respects
the
gals
too
whenever
you
see
one
on
with
a
whole
lot
of
sweethearts
it
an
even
chance
if
she
gets
married
to
any
on
one
cools
off
and
another
cools
off
and
before
she
brings
any
one
on
to
the
right
weldin
heat
the
coal
is
gone
and
the
fire
is
out
then
she
may
blow
and
blow
till
she
tired
she
may
blow
up
a
dust
but
the
deuce
of
a
flame
can
she
blow
up
agin
to
save
her
soul
alive
i
never
see
a
clever
lookin
gal
in
danger
of
that
i
long
to
whisper
in
her
ear
you
dear
little
critter
you
take
care
you
have
too
many
irons
in
the
fire
some
on
will
get
stone
cold
and
ones
will
get
burnt
so
they
never
be
no
good
in
natur
no
xxxiii
windsor
and
the
far
west
the
next
morning
the
clockmaker
proposed
to
take
a
drive
round
the
neighbourhood
you
had
ought
says
he
to
be
in
a
hurry
you
should
see
the
vicinity
of
this
location
there
ai
the
beat
of
it
to
be
found
anywhere
while
the
servants
were
harnessing
old
clay
we
went
to
see
a
new
bridge
which
had
recently
been
erected
over
the
avon
river
that
said
he
is
a
splendid
thing
a
new
yorker
built
it
and
the
folks
in
john
paid
for
it
you
mean
of
halifax
said
i
john
is
in
the
other
province
i
mean
what
i
say
he
replied
and
it
is
a
credit
to
new
brunswick
no
sir
the
halifax
folks
neither
know
nor
keer
much
about
the
country
they
would
take
hold
on
it
and
if
they
had
a
waited
for
them
it
would
have
been
one
while
afore
they
got
a
bridge
i
tell
you
they
no
spirit
and
plaguy
little
sympathy
with
the
country
and
i
tell
you
the
reason
on
it
there
are
a
good
many
people
there
from
other
parts
and
always
have
been
who
come
to
make
money
and
nothin
else
who
do
call
it
home
and
do
feel
to
home
and
who
intend
to
up
killoch
and
off
as
soon
as
they
have
made
their
ned
out
of
the
bluenoses
they
have
got
about
as
much
regard
for
the
country
as
a
peddler
has
who
trudges
along
with
a
pack
on
his
back
he
walks
he
intends
to
ride
at
last
trusts
he
intends
to
sue
at
last
smiles
he
intends
to
cheat
at
last
saves
all
he
intends
to
move
all
at
last
it
actilly
overrun
with
transient
paupers
and
transient
speculators
and
these
last
grumble
and
growl
like
a
bear
with
a
sore
head
the
whole
blessed
time
at
everything
and
can
hardly
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
their
head
while
they
fobbin
your
money
hand
over
hand
these
critters
feel
no
interest
in
anything
but
cent
per
cent
they
deaden
public
spirit
they
hai
got
none
themselves
and
they
larf
at
it
in
others
and
when
you
add
their
numbers
to
the
timid
ones
the
stingy
ones
the
ignorant
ones
and
the
poor
ones
that
are
to
be
found
in
every
place
why
the
few
ones
that
left
are
too
few
to
do
anything
and
so
nothin
is
done
it
appears
to
me
if
i
was
a
bluenose
i
but
thank
fortin
i
ai
so
i
says
nothin
but
there
is
somethin
that
ai
altogether
jist
right
is
this
country
that
a
fact
but
what
a
country
this
bay
country
is
is
it
look
at
that
medder
bea
it
lovely
the
of
illanoy
are
the
top
of
the
ladder
with
us
but
these
dykes
take
the
shine
off
them
by
a
long
chalk
that
sartin
the
land
in
our
far
west
it
is
generally
allowed
ca
be
no
better
what
you
plant
is
sure
to
grow
and
yield
well
and
food
is
so
cheap
you
can
live
there
for
half
nothin
but
it
do
agree
with
us
new
england
folks
we
do
enjoy
good
health
there
and
what
in
the
world
is
the
use
of
food
if
you
have
such
an
etarnal
dyspepsy
you
ca
digest
it
a
man
can
hardly
live
there
till
next
grass
afore
he
is
in
the
yaller
leaf
just
like
one
of
our
bran
new
vessels
built
down
in
maine
of
best
hackmatack
or
better
still
of
our
real
american
live
oak
and
that
allowed
to
be
about
the
best
in
the
world
send
her
off
to
the
west
indies
and
let
her
lie
there
awhile
and
the
worms
will
riddle
her
bottom
all
full
of
holes
like
a
tin
cullender
or
a
board
with
a
grist
of
duck
shot
through
it
you
would
believe
what
a
bore
they
be
well
that
jist
the
case
with
the
western
climate
the
heat
takes
the
solder
out
of
the
knees
and
elbows
weakens
the
joints
and
makes
the
frame
ricketty
besides
we
like
the
smell
of
the
salt
water
it
seems
kinder
nateral
to
us
new
englanders
we
can
make
more
of
the
seas
than
ploughin
of
a
it
would
take
a
bottom
near
about
as
long
as
connecticut
river
to
raise
wheat
enough
to
buy
the
cargo
of
a
nantucket
whaler
or
a
salem
tea
ship
and
then
to
leave
one
folks
and
native
place
where
one
was
raised
halter
broke
and
trained
to
go
in
gear
and
exchange
all
the
comforts
of
the
old
states
for
them
are
new
ones
do
seem
to
go
down
well
at
all
why
the
very
sight
of
the
yankee
gals
is
good
for
sore
eyes
the
dear
little
critters
they
do
look
so
scrumptious
i
tell
you
with
their
cheeks
bloomin
like
a
red
rose
budded
on
a
white
one
and
their
eyes
like
adams
diamonds
that
folks
say
shine
as
well
in
the
dark
as
in
the
light
neck
like
a
swan
lips
chock
full
of
kisses
lick
it
fairly
makes
one
mouth
water
to
think
on
but
it
no
use
talkin
they
are
just
made
critters
that
a
fact
full
of
health
and
life
and
beauty
now
to
change
them
splendid
white
of
connecticut
and
rhode
island
for
the
yaller
crocusses
of
illanoy
is
what
we
do
like
it
goes
most
confoundedly
agin
the
grain
i
tell
you
poor
critters
when
they
get
away
back
there
they
grow
as
thin
as
a
sawed
lath
their
little
peepers
are
as
dull
as
a
boiled
codfish
their
skin
looks
like
yaller
fever
and
they
seem
all
mouth
like
a
crocodile
and
that
not
the
worst
of
it
neither
for
when
a
woman
begins
to
grow
saller
all
over
with
her
she
up
a
tree
then
you
may
depend
there
no
mistake
you
can
no
more
bring
back
her
bloom
than
you
can
the
colour
to
a
leaf
the
frost
has
touched
in
the
fall
it
gone
goose
with
her
that
a
fact
and
that
not
all
for
the
temper
is
plaguy
apt
to
change
with
the
cheek
too
when
the
freshness
of
youth
is
on
the
move
the
sweetness
of
temper
is
amazin
apt
to
start
along
with
it
a
bilious
cheek
and
a
sour
temper
are
like
the
siamese
twins
a
nateral
cord
of
union
atween
them
the
one
is
a
sign
board
with
the
name
of
the
firm
written
on
it
in
big
letters
he
that
know
this
ca
read
i
guess
it
no
use
to
cry
over
spilt
milk
we
all
know
but
it
easier
said
than
done
that
women
kind
and
especially
single
folks
will
take
on
dreadful
at
the
fadin
of
their
roses
and
their
frettin
only
seems
to
make
the
thorns
look
sharper
our
minister
used
to
say
to
sister
sall
and
when
she
was
young
she
was
a
real
witch
an
everlastin
sweet
girl
he
used
to
say
the
time
to
larn
when
you
are
young
store
your
mind
well
dear
and
the
fragrance
will
remain
long
arter
the
rose
has
shed
its
leaves
the
otter
of
roses
is
stronger
than
the
rose
and
a
plaguy
sight
more
valuable
sall
wrote
it
down
she
said
it
a
bad
idee
that
but
father
larfed
he
said
he
guessed
courtin
days
war
over
when
he
made
such
pretty
speeches
as
that
to
the
gals
now
who
would
go
to
expose
his
wife
or
his
darters
or
himself
to
the
dangers
of
such
a
climate
for
the
sake
of
thirty
bushels
of
wheat
to
the
acre
instead
of
fifteen
there
seems
a
kinder
somethin
in
us
that
rises
in
our
throat
when
we
think
on
it
and
wo
let
us
we
do
like
it
give
me
the
shore
and
let
them
that
like
the
far
west
go
there
i
say
this
place
is
as
fartile
as
illanoy
or
ohio
as
healthy
as
any
part
of
the
globe
and
right
along
side
of
the
salt
water
but
the
folks
want
three
things
industry
enterprise
economy
these
bluenoses
do
know
how
to
vally
this
location
only
look
at
it
and
see
what
a
place
for
bisness
it
is
the
centre
of
the
province
the
nateral
capital
of
the
basin
of
minas
and
part
of
the
bay
of
fundy
the
great
thoroughfare
to
john
canada
and
the
united
states
the
exports
of
lime
gypsum
freestone
and
grindstone
the
dykes
but
it
no
use
talkin
i
wish
we
had
it
that
all
our
folks
are
like
a
rock
maple
tree
stick
in
anywhere
but
eend
up
and
top
down
and
they
will
take
root
and
grow
but
put
in
a
real
good
soil
like
this
and
give
a
fair
chance
and
they
will
go
ahead
and
thrive
right
off
most
amazin
fast
that
a
fact
yes
if
we
had
it
we
would
make
another
guess
place
of
it
from
what
it
is
in
one
year
we
would
have
a
railroad
to
halifax
which
unlike
the
stone
that
killed
two
birds
would
be
the
makin
of
both
places
i
often
tell
the
folks
this
but
all
they
can
say
is
we
are
too
poor
and
too
young
says
i
put
me
in
mind
of
a
great
long
legged
long
tailed
colt
father
had
he
never
changed
his
name
of
colt
as
long
as
he
lived
and
he
was
as
old
as
the
hills
and
though
he
had
the
best
of
feed
was
as
thin
as
a
whippin
post
he
was
colt
all
his
days
always
young
always
poor
and
young
and
poor
you
be
i
guess
to
the
eend
of
the
chapter
on
our
return
to
the
inn
the
weather
which
had
been
threatening
for
some
time
past
became
very
tempestuous
it
rained
for
three
successive
days
and
the
roads
were
almost
impassible
to
continue
my
journey
was
wholly
out
of
the
question
i
determined
therefore
to
take
a
seat
in
the
coach
for
halifax
and
defer
until
next
year
the
remaining
part
of
my
tour
slick
agreed
to
meet
me
here
in
june
and
to
provide
for
me
the
same
conveyance
i
had
used
from
amherst
i
look
forward
with
much
pleasure
to
our
meeting
again
his
manner
and
idiom
were
to
me
perfectly
new
and
very
amusing
while
his
good
sound
sense
searching
observation
and
queer
humour
rendered
his
conversation
at
once
valuable
and
interesting
there
are
many
subjects
on
which
i
should
like
to
draw
him
out
and
i
promise
myself
a
fund
of
amusement
in
his
remarks
on
the
state
of
society
and
manners
at
halifax
and
the
machinery
of
the
local
government
on
both
of
which
he
appears
to
entertain
many
original
and
some
very
just
opinions
as
he
took
leave
of
me
in
the
coach
he
whispered
inside
of
your
great
big
cloak
you
will
find
wrapped
up
a
box
containin
a
thousand
real
genuine
first
chop
havanas
no
mistake
the
clear
thing
when
you
smoke
think
sometimes
of
your
old
companion
sam
slick
the
clockmaker
