preface
an
eternal
being
created
human
society
as
it
is
and
submission
to
and
is
imposed
on
the
classes
by
divine
will
this
suggestion
coming
from
pulpit
platform
and
press
has
hypnotized
the
minds
of
men
and
proves
to
be
one
of
the
strongest
pillars
of
exploitation
scientific
investigation
has
revealed
long
ago
that
human
society
is
not
cast
in
a
stereotyped
mould
as
organic
life
on
earth
assumes
different
shapes
the
result
of
a
succession
of
chemical
changes
so
the
group
life
of
human
beings
develops
different
social
institutions
as
a
result
of
increasing
control
over
environment
especially
of
production
of
food
clothing
and
shelter
such
is
the
message
which
the
works
of
men
like
bachofen
morgan
marx
darwin
and
others
brought
to
the
human
race
but
this
message
never
reached
the
great
mass
of
humanity
in
the
united
states
the
names
of
these
men
are
practically
unknown
their
books
are
either
out
of
print
as
is
the
case
with
the
fundamental
works
of
morgan
or
they
are
not
translated
into
english
only
a
few
of
them
are
accessible
to
a
few
individuals
on
the
dusty
shelves
of
some
public
libraries
their
message
is
dangerous
to
the
existing
order
and
it
will
not
do
to
give
it
publicity
at
a
time
when
further
intellectual
progress
of
large
bodies
of
men
means
the
doom
of
the
ruling
class
the
capitalist
system
has
progressed
so
far
that
all
farther
progress
must
bring
danger
to
it
and
to
those
who
are
supreme
through
it
but
the
forces
which
have
brought
about
the
present
social
order
continue
their
work
regardless
of
the
wishes
of
a
few
exploiters
a
comprehensive
work
summarizing
our
present
knowledge
of
the
development
of
social
institutions
is
therefore
a
timely
contribution
to
socialist
propaganda
in
order
to
meet
the
requirements
of
socialists
such
a
summary
must
be
written
by
a
socialist
all
the
scientists
who
devoted
themselves
to
the
study
of
primeval
society
belonged
to
the
privileged
classes
and
even
the
most
radical
of
them
lewis
morgan
was
prevented
by
his
environment
from
pointing
out
the
one
fact
the
recognition
of
which
distinguishes
the
socialist
position
from
all
others
the
existence
of
a
class
struggle
the
strongest
allusion
to
this
fact
is
found
in
the
following
passage
of
ancient
society
property
and
office
were
the
foundations
upon
which
aristocracy
planted
itself
whether
this
principle
shall
live
or
die
has
been
one
of
the
great
problems
with
which
modern
society
has
been
engaged
as
a
question
between
equal
rights
and
unequal
rights
between
equal
laws
and
unequal
laws
between
the
rights
of
wealth
of
rank
and
of
official
position
and
the
power
of
justice
and
intelligence
there
can
be
little
doubt
of
the
ultimate
result
page
yet
morgan
held
that
several
thousand
years
have
passed
away
without
the
overthrow
of
the
privileged
classes
excepting
in
the
united
states
but
in
the
days
of
the
trusts
of
government
by
injunction
of
sets
of
with
all
the
arrogance
and
exclusiveness
of
european
nobility
of
aristocratic
branches
of
the
daughters
of
the
revolution
and
other
gifts
of
capitalist
development
the
modern
american
workingman
will
hardly
share
morgan
optimistic
view
that
there
are
no
privileged
classes
in
the
united
states
it
must
be
admitted
however
that
to
this
day
morgan
work
is
the
most
fundamental
and
exhaustive
of
any
written
on
the
subject
of
ancient
social
development
westermarck
history
of
human
marriage
treats
the
question
mainly
from
the
standpoint
of
ethnology
and
natural
history
as
a
scientific
treatise
it
is
entirely
inadequate
being
simply
a
compilation
of
data
from
all
parts
of
the
world
arranged
without
the
understanding
of
gentile
organizations
or
of
the
materialistic
conception
of
history
and
used
for
wild
speculations
kovalevsky
argument
turns
on
the
proposition
that
the
patriarchal
household
is
a
typical
stage
of
society
intermediate
between
the
matriarchal
and
monogamic
family
none
of
these
men
could
discuss
the
matter
from
the
proletarian
point
of
view
for
in
order
to
do
this
it
is
necessary
to
descend
from
the
hills
of
class
assumption
into
the
valley
of
proletarian
this
consciousness
and
the
socialist
mind
are
born
together
the
key
to
the
philosophy
of
capitalism
is
the
philosophy
of
socialism
with
the
rays
of
this
searchlight
engels
exposed
the
pious
deceivers
property
and
the
state
and
their
lofty
ideal
covetousness
and
the
monogamic
family
so
far
from
being
a
divinely
instituted
union
of
souls
is
seen
to
be
the
product
of
a
series
of
material
and
in
the
last
analysis
of
the
most
sordid
motives
but
the
ethics
of
property
are
worthy
of
a
system
of
production
that
in
its
final
stage
shuts
the
overwhelming
mass
of
longing
humanity
out
from
the
happiness
of
home
and
family
life
from
all
evolution
to
a
higher
individuality
and
even
drives
progress
back
and
forces
millions
of
human
beings
into
irrevocable
degeneration
the
desire
for
a
higher
life
can
not
awake
in
a
man
until
he
is
thoroughly
convinced
that
his
present
life
is
ugly
low
and
capable
of
improvement
by
himself
the
present
little
volume
is
especially
adapted
to
assist
the
exploited
of
both
sexes
in
recognizing
the
actual
causes
which
brought
about
their
present
condition
by
opening
the
eyes
of
the
deluded
throng
and
reducing
the
vaporings
of
their
ignorant
or
selfish
leaders
in
politics
and
education
to
sober
reality
it
will
show
the
way
out
of
the
darkness
and
mazes
of
slavish
traditions
into
the
light
and
freedom
of
a
fuller
life
on
earth
these
are
the
reasons
for
introducing
this
little
volume
to
english
speaking
readers
without
any
further
apology
we
leave
them
to
its
perusal
and
to
their
own
conclusions

august
author
preface
to
the
first
edition
the
following
chapters
are
in
a
certain
sense
executing
a
bequest
it
was
no
less
a
man
than
karl
marx
who
had
reserved
to
himself
the
privilege
of
displaying
the
results
of
morgan
investigations
in
connection
with
his
own
materialistic
conception
of
history
which
i
might
call
ours
within
certain
limits
he
wished
thus
to
elucidate
the
full
meaning
of
this
conception
for
in
america
morgan
had
in
a
manner
discovered
anew
the
materialistic
conception
of
history
originated
by
marx
forty
years
ago
in
comparing
barbarism
and
civilization
he
had
arrived
in
the
main
at
the
same
results
as
marx
and
just
as
capital
was
zealously
plagiarized
and
persistently
passed
over
in
silence
by
the
professional
economists
in
germany
so
ancient
society
was
treated
by
the
spokesmen
of
prehistoric
science
in
england
my
work
can
offer
only
a
meager
substitute
for
that
which
my
departed
friend
was
not
destined
to
accomplish
but
in
his
copious
extracts
from
morgan
i
have
critical
notes
which
i
herewith
reproduce
as
fully
as
feasible
according
to
the
materialistic
conception
the
decisive
element
of
history
is
the
production
and
reproduction
of
life
and
its
material
requirements
this
implies
on
the
one
hand
the
production
of
the
means
of
existence
food
clothing
shelter
and
the
necessary
tools
on
the
other
hand
the
generation
of
children
the
propagation
of
the
species
the
social
institutions
under
which
the
people
of
a
certain
historical
period
and
of
a
certain
country
are
living
are
dependent
on
these
two
forms
of
production
partly
on
the
development
of
labor
partly
on
that
of
the
family
the
less
labor
is
developed
and
the
less
abundant
the
quantity
of
its
production
and
therefore
the
wealth
of
society
the
more
society
is
seen
to
be
under
the
domination
of
sexual
ties
however
under
this
formation
based
on
sexual
ties
the
productivity
of
labor
is
developed
more
and
more
at
the
same
time
private
property
and
exchange
distinctions
of
wealth
exploitation
of
the
labor
power
of
others
and
by
this
agency
the
foundation
of
class
antagonism
are
formed
these
new
elements
of
society
strive
in
the
course
of
time
to
adapt
the
old
state
of
society
to
the
new
conditions
until
the
impossibility
of
harmonizing
these
two
at
last
leads
to
a
complete
revolution
the
old
form
of
society
founded
on
sexual
relations
is
abolished
in
the
clash
with
the
recently
developed
social
classes
a
new
society
steps
into
being
crystallized
into
the
state
the
units
of
the
latter
are
no
longer
sexual
but
local
groups
a
society
in
which
family
relations
are
entirely
subordinated
to
property
relations
thereby
freely
developing
those
class
antagonisms
and
class
struggles
that
make
up
the
contents
of
all
written
history
up
to
the
present
time
morgan
deserves
great
credit
for
rediscovering
and
in
its
main
outlines
this
foundation
of
our
written
history
and
of
finding
in
the
sexual
organizations
of
the
north
american
indians
the
key
that
opens
all
the
unfathomable
riddles
of
most
ancient
greek
roman
and
german
history
his
book
is
not
the
work
of
a
short
day
for
more
than
forty
years
he
grappled
with
the
subject
until
he
mastered
it
fully
therefore
his
work
is
one
of
the
few
epochal
publications
of
our
time
in
the
following
demonstrations
the
reader
will
on
the
whole
easily
distinguish
what
originated
with
morgan
and
what
was
added
by
myself
in
the
historical
sections
on
greece
and
rome
i
have
not
limited
myself
to
morgan
material
but
have
added
as
much
as
i
could
supply
the
sections
on
celts
and
germans
essentially
belong
to
me
morgan
had
only
sources
of
minor
quality
at
his
disposal
and
for
german
conditions
aside
from
tacitus
only
the
worthless
unbridled
falsifications
of
freeman
the
economic
deductions
sufficient
for
morgan
purpose
but
wholly
inadequate
for
mine
were
treated
anew
by
myself
and
lastly
i
am
of
course
responsible
for
all
final
conclusions
unless
morgan
is
expressly
quoted
frederick
engels
author
preface
to
the
fourth
edition
the
first
large
editions
of
this
work
have
been
out
of
print
for
nearly
six
months
and
the
publisher
has
for
some
time
requested
of
me
the
arrangement
of
a
new
edition
urgent
duties
have
hitherto
prevented
me
seven
years
have
passed
since
the
first
edition
made
its
appearance
during
this
time
the
study
of
primeval
forms
of
the
family
has
made
considerable
progress
hence
it
became
necessary
to
apply
diligently
the
improving
and
supplementing
hand
more
especially
as
the
proposed
stereotyping
of
the
present
text
will
make
further
changes
impossible
for
some
time
consequently
i
have
subjected
the
whole
text
to
a
thorough
revision
and
made
a
number
of
additions
which
i
hope
will
give
due
recognition
to
the
present
stage
of
scientific
progress
furthermore
i
give
in
the
course
of
this
preface
a
short
synopsis
of
the
history
of
the
family
as
treated
by
various
writers
from
bachofen
to
morgan
i
am
doing
this
mainly
because
the
english
prehistoric
school
tinged
with
chauvinism
is
continually
doing
its
utmost
to
kill
by
its
silence
the
revolution
in
primeval
conceptions
effected
by
morgan
discoveries
at
the
same
time
this
school
is
not
at
all
backward
in
appropriating
to
its
own
use
the
results
of
morgan
study
in
certain
other
circles
also
this
english
example
is
unhappily
followed
rather
extensively

by

ravé
founded
on
the

german
edition
is
under
the
press
up
to
the
beginning
of
the
sixties
a
history
of
the
family
can
not
be
spoken
of
this
branch
of
historical
science
was
then
entirely
under
the
influence
of
the
decalogue
the
patriarchal
form
of
the
family
described
more
exhaustively
by
moses
than
by
anybody
else
was
not
only
without
further
comment
considered
as
the
most
ancient
but
also
as
identical
with
the
family
of
our
times
no
historical
development
of
the
family
was
even
recognized
at
best
it
was
admitted
that
a
period
of
sexual
license
might
have
existed
in
primeval
times
to
be
sure
aside
from
monogamy
oriental
polygamy
and
polyandry
were
known
but
these
three
forms
could
not
be
arranged
in
any
historical
order
and
stood
side
by
side
without
any
connection
that
some
nations
of
ancient
history
and
some
savage
tribes
of
the
present
day
did
not
trace
their
descent
to
the
father
but
to
the
mother
hence
considered
the
female
lineage
as
alone
valid
that
many
nations
of
our
time
prohibit
intermarrying
inside
of
certain
large
groups
the
extent
of
which
was
not
yet
ascertained
and
that
this
custom
is
found
in
all
parts
of
the
globe
these
facts
were
known
indeed
and
more
examples
were
continually
collected
but
nobody
knew
how
to
make
use
of
them
even
in
taylor
researches
into
the
early
history
of
mankind
etc
they
are
only
mentioned
as
queer
customs
together
with
the
usage
of
some
savage
tribes
to
prohibit
the
touching
of
burning
wood
with
iron
tools
and
similar
religious
absurdities
this
history
of
the
family
dates
from
the
year
of
the
publication
of
bachofen
mutterrecht
maternal
law
here
the
author
makes
the
following
propositions
that
in
the
beginning
people
lived
in
unrestricted
sexual
intercourse
which
he
dubs
not
very
felicitously
hetaerism
that
such
an
intercourse
excludes
any
absolutely
certain
means
of
determining
parentage
that
consequently
descent
could
only
be
traced
by
the
female
line
in
compliance
with
maternal
law
and
that
this
was
universally
practiced
by
all
the
nations
of
antiquity
that
consequently
women
as
mothers
being
the
only
well
known
parents
of
younger
generations
received
a
high
tribute
of
respect
and
deference
amounting
to
a
complete
women
rule
gynaicocracy
according
to
bachofen
idea
that
the
transition
to
monogamy
reserving
a
certain
woman
exclusively
to
one
man
implied
the
violation
of
a
primeval
religious
law
practically
a
violation
of
the
customary
right
of
all
other
men
to
the
same
woman
which
violation
had
to
be
atoned
for
or
its
permission
purchased
by
the
surrender
of
the
women
to
the
public
for
a
limited
time
bachofen
finds
the
proofs
of
these
propositions
in
numerous
quotations
from
ancient
classics
collected
with
unusual
diligence
the
transition
from
hetaerism
to
monogamy
and
from
maternal
to
paternal
law
is
accomplished
according
to
him
especially
by
the
greeks
through
the
evolution
of
religious
ideas
new
gods
the
representatives
of
the
new
ideas
are
added
to
the
traditional
group
of
gods
the
representatives
of
old
ideas
the
latter
are
forced
to
the
background
more
and
more
by
the
former
according
to
bachofen
therefore
it
is
not
the
development
of
the
actual
conditions
of
life
that
has
effected
the
historical
changes
in
the
relative
social
positions
of
man
and
wife
but
the
religious
reflection
of
these
conditions
in
the
minds
of
men
hence
bachofen
represents
the
oresteia
of
aeschylos
as
the
dramatic
description
of
the
fight
between
the
vanishing
maternal
and
the
paternal
law
rising
and
victorious
during
the
time
of
the
heroes
klytaemnestra
has
killed
her
husband
agamemnon
on
his
return
from
the
trojan
war
for
the
sake
of
her
lover
aegisthos
but
orestes
her
son
by
agamemnon
avenges
the
death
of
his
father
by
killing
his
mother
therefore
he
is
persecuted
by
the
erinyes
the
demonic
protectors
of
maternal
law
according
to
which
the
murder
of
a
mother
is
the
most
horrible
inexpiable
crime
but
apollo
who
has
instigated
orestes
to
this
act
by
his
oracle
and
athene
who
is
invoked
as
arbitrator
the
two
deities
representing
the
new
paternal
order
of
things
protect
him
athene
gives
a
hearing
to
both
parties
the
whole
question
is
summarized
in
the
ensuing
debate
between
orestes
and
the
erinyes
orestes
claims
that
klytemnaestra
has
committed
a
twofold
crime
by
killing
her
husband
she
has
killed
his
father
why
do
the
erinyes
persecute
him
and
not
her
who
is
far
more
guilty
the
reply
is
striking
she
was
not
related
by
blood
to
the
man
whom
she
slew
the
murder
of
a
man
not
consanguineous
even
though
he
be
the
husband
of
the
murderess
is
expiable
does
not
concern
the
erinyes
it
is
only
their
duty
to
prosecute
the
murder
of
consanguineous
relatives
according
to
maternal
law
therefore
the
murder
of
a
mother
is
the
most
heinous
and
inexpiable
crime
now
apollo
speaks
in
defense
of
orestes
athene
then
calls
on
the
areopagites
the
jurors
of
athens
to
vote
the
votes
are
even
for
acquittal
and
for
condemnation
thereupon
athene
as
president
of
the
jury
casts
her
vote
in
favor
of
orestes
and
acquits
him
paternal
law
has
gained
a
victory
over
maternal
law
the
deities
of
the
younger
generation
as
the
erinyes
call
them
vanquish
the
latter
these
are
finally
persuaded
to
accept
a
new
office
under
the
new
order
of
things
this
new
but
decidedly
accurate
interpretation
of
the
oresteia
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
best
passages
in
the
whole
book
but
it
proves
at
the
same
time
that
bachofen
himself
believes
as
much
in
the
erinyes
in
apollo
and
in
athene
as
aeschylos
did
in
his
day
he
really
believes
that
they
performed
the
miracle
of
securing
the
downfall
of
maternal
law
through
paternal
law
during
the
time
of
the
greek
heroes
that
a
similar
conception
representing
religion
as
the
main
lever
of
the
world
history
must
finally
lead
to
sheer
mysticism
is
evident
therefore
it
is
a
troublesome
and
not
always
profitable
task
to
work
your
way
through
the
big
volume
of
bachofen
still
all
this
does
not
curtail
the
value
of
his
fundamental
work
he
was
the
first
to
replace
the
assumption
of
an
unknown
primeval
condition
of
licentious
sexual
intercourse
by
the
demonstration
that
ancient
classical
literature
points
out
a
multitude
of
traces
proving
the
actual
existence
among
greeks
and
asiatics
of
other
sexual
relations
before
monogamy
these
relations
not
only
permitted
a
man
to
have
intercourse
with
several
women
but
also
left
a
woman
free
to
have
sexual
intercourse
with
several
men
without
violating
good
morals
this
custom
did
not
disappear
without
leaving
as
a
survival
the
form
of
a
general
surrender
for
a
limited
time
by
which
women
had
to
purchase
the
right
of
monogamy
hence
descent
could
originally
only
be
traced
by
the
female
line
from
mother
to
mother
the
sole
legality
of
the
female
line
was
preserved
far
into
the
time
of
monogamy
with
assured
or
at
least
acknowledged
paternity
consequently
the
original
position
of
the
mothers
as
the
sole
absolutely
certain
parents
of
their
children
secured
for
them
and
for
all
other
women
a
higher
social
level
than
they
have
ever
enjoyed
since
although
bachofen
biased
by
his
mystic
conceptions
did
not
formulate
these
propositions
so
clearly
still
he
proved
their
correctness
this
was
equivalent
to
a
complete
revolution
in
bachofen
big
volume
was
written
in
german
in
the
language
of
a
nation
that
cared
less
than
any
other
of
its
time
for
the
history
of
the
present
family
therefore
he
remained
unknown
the
man
next
succeeding
him
in
the
same
field
made
his
appearance
in
without
having
ever
heard
of
bachofen
this
successor
was
mclennan
the
direct
opposite
of
his
predecessor
instead
of
the
talented
mystic
we
have
here
the
dry
jurist
in
place
of
the
rank
growth
of
poetical
imagination
we
find
the
plausible
combinations
of
the
pleading
lawyer
mclennan
finds
among
many
savage
barbarian
and
even
civilized
people
of
ancient
and
modern
times
a
type
of
marriage
forcing
the
alone
or
in
with
his
friends
to
go
through
the
form
of
a
mock
forcible
abduction
of
the
bride
this
must
needs
be
a
survival
of
an
earlier
custom
when
men
of
one
tribe
actually
secured
their
wives
by
forcible
abduction
from
another
tribe
how
did
this
robber
marriage
originate
as
long
as
the
men
could
find
women
enough
in
their
own
tribe
there
was
no
occasion
for
robbing
it
so
happens
that
we
frequently
find
certain
groups
among
undeveloped
nations
which
in
were
often
considered
identical
with
the
tribes
themselves
inside
of
which
intermarrying
was
prohibited
in
consequence
the
men
or
women
of
a
certain
group
were
forced
to
choose
their
wives
or
husbands
outside
of
their
group
other
tribes
again
observe
the
custom
of
forcing
their
men
to
choose
their
women
inside
of
their
own
group
only
mclennan
calls
the
first
exogamous
the
second
endogamous
and
construes
forthwith
a
rigid
contrast
between
exogamous
and
endogamous
tribes
and
though
his
own
investigation
of
exogamy
makes
it
painfully
obvious
that
this
contrast
in
many
if
not
in
most
or
even
in
all
cases
exists
in
his
own
imagination
only
he
nevertheless
makes
it
the
basis
of
his
entire
theory
according
to
the
latter
exogamous
tribes
can
choose
their
women
only
from
other
tribes
and
as
in
conformity
with
their
savage
state
a
condition
of
continual
warfare
existed
among
such
tribes
women
could
only
be
secured
by
abduction
mclennan
further
asks
whence
this
custom
of
exogamy
the
idea
of
consanguinity
and
rape
could
not
have
anything
to
do
with
it
since
these
conceptions
were
developed
much
later
but
it
was
a
widely
spread
custom
among
savages
to
kill
female
children
immediately
after
their
birth
this
produced
a
surplus
of
males
in
such
a
tribe
which
naturally
resulted
in
the
condition
where
several
men
had
one
woman
polyandry
the
next
consequence
was
that
the
mother
of
a
child
could
be
ascertained
but
not
its
father
hence
descent
only
traced
by
the
female
line
and
exclusion
of
male
lineage
maternal
law
and
a
second
consequence
of
the
scarcity
of
women
in
a
certain
tribe
a
scarcity
that
was
somewhat
mitigated
but
not
relieved
by
polyandry
was
precisely
the
forcible
abduction
of
women
from
other
tribes
as
exogamy
and
polyandry
are
referable
to
one
and
the
same
cause
a
want
of
balance
between
the
sexes
we
are
forced
to
regard
all
the
exogamous
races
as
having
originally
been
polyandrous
therefore
we
must
hold
it
to
be
beyond
dispute
that
among
exogamous
races
the
first
system
of
kinship
was
that
which
recognized
through
mothers
only
it
is
the
merit
of
mclennan
to
have
pointed
out
the
general
extent
and
the
great
importance
of
what
he
calls
exogamy
however
he
has
by
no
means
discovered
the
fact
of
exogamous
groups
neither
did
he
understand
their
presence
aside
from
earlier
scattered
notes
of
many
observers
from
which
mclennan
quoted
latham
had
accurately
and
correctly
described
this
institution
among
the
indian
magars
and
stated
that
it
was
widespread
and
practiced
in
all
parts
of
the
globe
mclennan
himself
quotes
this
passage
as
early
as
our
friend
morgan
had
also
pointed
out
and
correctly
described
the
same
custom
in
his
letters
on
the
iroquois
in
the
american
review
and
in
in
the
league
of
the
iroquois
we
shall
see
how
the
lawyer
instinct
of
mclennan
has
introduced
more
disorder
into
this
subject
than
the
mystic
imagination
of
bachofen
did
into
the
field
of
maternal
law
it
must
be
said
to
mclennan
credit
that
he
recognized
the
custom
of
tracing
decent
by
maternal
law
as
primeval
although
bachofen
has
anticipated
him
in
this
respect
mclennan
has
admitted
this
later
on
but
here
again
he
is
not
clear
on
the
subject
he
always
speaks
of
kinship
through
females
only
and
uses
this
expression
correctly
applicable
to
former
stages
in
connection
with
later
stages
of
development
when
descent
and
heredity
were
still
exclusively
traced
along
female
lines
but
at
the
same
time
kinship
on
the
male
side
began
to
be
recognized
and
expressed
it
is
the
of
the
jurist
establishing
a
fixed
legal
expression
and
employing
it
incessantly
to
denote
conditions
to
which
it
should
no
longer
be
applied
in
spite
of
its
plausibility
mclennan
theory
did
not
seem
too
well
founded
even
in
the
eyes
of
its
author
at
least
he
finds
it
remarkable
himself
that
the
form
of
capture
is
now
most
distinctly
marked
and
impressive
just
among
those
races
which
have
male
kinship
and
again
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
nowhere
now
that
we
are
aware
of
is
infanticide
a
system
where
exogamy
and
the
earliest
form
of
kinship
both
these
facts
directly
disprove
his
method
of
explanation
and
he
can
only
meet
them
with
new
and
still
more
complicated
hypotheses
in
spite
of
this
his
theory
found
great
approval
and
favor
in
england
here
mclennan
was
generally
considered
as
the
founder
of
the
history
of
the
family
and
as
the
first
authority
on
this
subject
his
contrast
of
exogamous
and
endogamous
tribes
remained
the
recognized
foundation
of
the
customary
views
however
much
single
exceptions
and
modifications
were
admitted
this
antithesis
became
the
that
rendered
impossible
any
free
view
of
the
field
under
investigation
and
therefore
any
decided
progress
it
is
our
duty
to
confront
this
overrating
of
mclennan
practised
in
england
and
copied
elsewhere
with
the
fact
that
he
has
done
more
harm
with
his
contrast
of
exogamous
and
endogamous
tribes
than
he
has
done
good
by
his
investigations
moreover
in
the
course
of
time
more
and
more
facts
became
known
that
did
not
fit
into
his
neat
frame
mclennan
knew
only
three
forms
of
marriage
polygamy
polyandry
and
monogamy
but
once
attention
had
been
directed
to
this
point
then
more
and
more
proofs
were
found
that
among
undeveloped
nations
there
were
connubial
forms
in
which
a
group
of
men
possessed
a
group
of
women
lubbock
in
his
origin
of
civilization
recognized
this
communal
marriage
as
a
historical
fact
immediately
after
him
in
morgan
appeared
with
fresh
and
in
many
respects
conclusive
material
he
had
convinced
himself
that
the
peculiar
system
of
kinship
in
vogue
among
the
iroquois
was
common
to
all
the
aborigines
of
the
united
states
and
practised
all
over
the
continent
although
it
was
in
direct
contradiction
with
all
the
degrees
of
relation
arising
from
the
connubial
system
in
practice
there
he
prevailed
on
the
federal
government
to
collect
information
on
the
systems
of
kinship
of
other
nations
by
the
help
of
question
blanks
and
tables
drawn
up
by
himself
the
answers
brought
the
following
results
the
kinship
system
of
the
american
indians
is
also
in
vogue
in
asia
and
in
a
somewhat
modified
form
among
numerous
tribes
of
africa
and
australia
this
system
finds
a
complete
explanation
in
a
certain
form
of
communal
marriage
now
in
process
of
decline
in
hawaii
and
some
australian
islands
by
the
side
of
this
marital
form
there
is
in
practice
on
the
same
islands
a
system
of
kinship
only
explicable
by
a
still
more
primeval
and
now
extinct
form
of
communal
marriage
the
collected
data
and
the
conclusions
of
morgan
were
published
in
his
systems
of
consanguinity
and
affinity
and
discussion
transferred
to
a
far
more
extensive
field
taking
his
departure
from
the
system
of
affinity
he
reconstructed
the
corresponding
forms
of
the
family
thereby
opening
a
new
road
to
scientific
investigation
and
extending
the
retrospective
view
into
prehistoric
periods
of
human
life
once
this
view
gained
recognition
then
the
frail
structure
of
mclennan
would
vanish
into
thin
air
mclennan
defended
his
theory
in
the
new
edition
of
primitive
marriage
studies
in
ancient
history
while
he
himself
most
artificially
combines
into
a
history
of
the
family
a
number
of
hypotheses
he
not
only
demands
proofs
from
lubbock
and
morgan
for
every
one
of
their
propositions
but
insists
on
proofs
of
such
indisputable
validity
as
is
solely
recognized
in
a
scotch
court
and
this
is
done
by
the
same
man
who
unhesitatingly
concludes
that
the
following
people
practiced
polyandry
the
germans
on
account
of
the
intimate
relation
between
uncle
and
nephew
mother
brother
and
sister
son
the
britons
because
cesar
reports
that
the
britons
have
ten
to
twelve
women
in
common
barbarians
because
all
other
reports
of
the
old
writers
on
community
of
women
are
misinterpreted
by
him
one
is
reminded
of
a
prosecuting
attorney
who
takes
all
possible
liberty
in
making
up
his
case
but
who
demands
the
most
formal
and
legally
valid
proof
for
every
word
of
the
lawyer
for
the
defense
he
asserts
that
communal
marriage
is
purely
the
outgrowth
of
imagination
and
in
so
doing
falls
far
behind
bachofen
he
represents
morgan
systems
of
affinity
as
mere
codes
of
conventional
politeness
proven
by
the
fact
that
indians
address
also
strangers
white
people
as
brother
or
father
this
is
like
asserting
that
the
terms
father
mother
brother
sister
are
simply
meaningless
forms
of
address
because
catholic
priests
and
abbesses
are
also
addressed
as
father
and
mother
and
monks
and
nuns
or
even
and
members
of
english
professional
clubs
in
solemn
session
as
brother
and
sister
in
short
mclennan
defense
was
extremely
weak
one
point
still
remained
that
had
not
been
attacked
the
contrast
of
exogamous
and
endogamous
tribes
on
which
his
whole
system
was
founded
was
not
only
left
unchallenged
but
was
even
generally
regarded
as
the
pivotal
point
of
the
entire
history
of
the
family
it
was
admitted
that
mclennan
attempt
to
explain
this
contrast
was
insufficient
and
in
contradiction
with
the
facts
enumerated
by
himself
but
the
contrast
itself
the
existence
of
two
diametrically
opposed
forms
of
independent
and
absolute
groups
one
of
them
marrying
the
women
of
its
own
group
the
other
strictly
forbidding
this
habit
was
considered
irrefutable
gospel
compare
origines
de
la
famille
and
even
lubbock
origin
of
civilization
edition
at
this
point
morgan
main
work
ancient
society
inserts
its
lever
it
is
this
work
on
which
the
present
volume
is
based
here
we
find
clearly
demonstrated
what
was
only
dimly
perceived
by
morgan
in
there
is
no
antithesis
between
endogamy
and
exogamy
no
exogamous
tribes
have
been
found
up
to
the
present
time
but
at
the
time
when
communal
marriage
still
existed
and
in
all
probability
it
once
existed
everywhere
a
tribe
was
subdivided
into
a
number
of
groups
gentes
consanguineous
on
the
mother
side
within
which
intermarrying
was
strictly
forbidden
the
men
of
a
certain
gens
therefore
could
choose
their
wives
within
the
tribe
and
did
so
as
a
rule
but
had
to
choose
them
outside
of
the
gens
and
while
thus
the
gens
was
strictly
exogamous
the
tribe
comprising
an
aggregate
of
gentes
was
equally
endogamous
this
fact
gave
the
final
blow
to
mclennan
artificial
structure
but
morgan
did
not
rest
here
the
gens
of
the
american
indians
furthermore
assisted
him
in
gaining
another
important
step
in
the
field
under
investigation
he
found
that
this
gens
organized
in
conformity
with
maternal
law
was
the
original
form
out
of
which
later
on
the
gens
by
paternal
law
developed
such
as
we
find
it
among
the
civilized
nations
of
antiquity
the
greek
and
roman
gens
an
unsolved
riddle
to
all
historians
up
to
our
time
found
its
explanation
in
the
indian
gens
a
new
foundation
was
discovered
for
the
entire
primeval
history
the
repeated
discovery
that
the
original
maternal
gens
was
a
preliminary
stage
of
the
paternal
gens
of
civilized
nations
has
the
same
signification
for
primeval
history
that
darwin
theory
of
evolution
had
for
biology
and
marx
theory
of
surplus
value
for
political
economy
morgan
was
thereby
enabled
to
sketch
the
outline
of
a
history
of
the
family
showing
in
bold
strokes
at
least
the
classic
stages
of
development
so
far
as
the
available
material
will
at
present
permit
such
a
thing
it
is
clearly
obvious
that
this
marks
a
new
epoch
in
the
treatment
of
primeval
history
the
maternal
gens
has
become
the
pivot
on
which
this
whole
science
revolves
since
its
discovery
we
know
in
what
direction
to
continue
our
researches
what
to
investigate
and
how
to
arrange
the
results
of
our
studies
in
consequence
progress
in
this
field
is
now
much
more
rapid
than
before
the
publication
of
morgan
book
the
discoveries
of
morgan
are
now
universally
recognized
or
rather
appropriated
even
by
the
archaeologists
of
england
but
hardly
one
of
them
openly
admits
that
we
owe
this
revolution
of
thought
to
morgan
his
book
is
ignored
in
england
as
much
as
possible
and
he
himself
is
dismissed
with
condescending
praise
for
the
excellence
of
his
former
works
the
details
of
his
discussion
are
diligently
criticised
but
his
really
great
discoveries
are
covered
up
obstinately
the
original
edition
of
ancient
society
is
out
of
print
there
is
no
paying
market
for
a
work
of
this
kind
in
america
in
england
it
appears
the
book
was
systematically
suppressed
and
the
only
edition
of
this
epochal
work
still
circulating
in
the
market
is
the
german
translation
whence
this
reserve
we
can
hardly
refrain
from
calling
it
a
conspiracy
to
kill
by
silence
especially
in
view
of
the
numerous
meaningless
and
polite
quotations
and
of
other
manifestations
of
fellowship
in
which
the
writings
of
our
recognized
archaeologists
abound
is
it
because
morgan
is
an
american
and
because
it
is
rather
hard
on
the
english
archaeologists
to
be
dependent
on
two
talented
foreigners
like
bachofen
and
morgan
for
the
outlines
determining
the
arrangement
and
grouping
of
their
material
in
spite
of
all
praiseworthy
diligence
in
accumulating
material
they
could
have
borne
with
the
german
but
an
american
in
face
of
an
american
every
englishman
becomes
patriotic
i
have
seen
amusing
illustrations
of
this
fact
in
the
united
states
moreover
it
must
be
remembered
that
mclennan
was
so
to
say
the
official
founder
and
leader
of
the
english
prehistoric
school
it
was
almost
a
requirement
of
good
prehistoric
manners
to
refer
in
terms
of
highest
admiration
to
his
artificial
construction
of
history
leading
from
infanticide
through
polyandry
and
abduction
to
maternal
law
the
least
doubt
in
the
strictly
independent
existence
of
exogamous
and
endogamous
tribes
was
considered
a
frivolous
sacrilege
according
to
this
view
morgan
in
reducing
all
these
sacred
dogmas
to
thin
air
committed
an
act
of
wanton
destruction
and
worse
still
his
mere
manner
of
reducing
them
sufficed
to
show
their
instability
so
that
the
admirers
of
mclennan
who
hitherto
had
been
stumbling
about
helplessly
between
exogamy
and
endogamy
were
almost
forced
to
slap
their
foreheads
and
exclaim
how
silly
of
us
not
to
have
found
that
out
long
ago
just
as
if
morgan
had
not
committed
crimes
enough
against
the
official
archaeologists
to
justify
them
in
discarding
all
fair
methods
and
assuming
an
attitude
of
cool
neglect
he
persisted
in
filling
their
cup
to
overflowing
not
only
does
he
criticise
civilization
the
society
of
production
for
profit
the
fundamental
form
of
human
society
in
a
manner
savoring
of
fourier
but
he
also
speaks
of
a
future
reorganization
of
society
in
language
that
karl
marx
might
have
used
consequently
he
receives
his
just
deserts
when
mclennan
indignantly
charges
him
with
a
profound
antipathy
against
historical
methods
and
when
professor
of
geneva
endorses
the
same
view
in
for
was
not
the
same
professor
still
wandering
about
aimlessly
in
the
maze
of
mclennan
exogamy
in
origines
de
la
famille
and
was
it
not
morgan
who
finally
had
to
set
him
free
it
is
not
necessary
to
dwell
in
this
preface
on
the
other
forms
of
progress
which
primeval
history
owes
to
morgan
reference
to
them
will
be
found
in
the
course
of
my
work
during
the
fourteen
years
that
have
elapsed
since
the
publication
of
his
main
work
the
material
contributing
to
the
history
of
primeval
society
has
been
considerably
enriched
anthropologists
travelers
and
professional
historians
were
joined
by
comparative
jurists
who
added
new
matter
and
opened
up
new
points
of
view
here
and
there
some
special
hypothesis
of
morgan
has
been
shaken
or
even
become
obsolete
but
in
no
instance
has
the
new
material
led
to
a
weakening
of
his
leading
propositions
the
order
he
established
in
primeval
history
still
holds
good
in
its
main
outlines
to
this
day
we
may
even
say
that
this
order
receives
recognition
in
the
exact
degree
in
which
the
authorship
of
this
great
progress
is
concealed

morgan
was
the
first
to
make
an
attempt
at
introducing
a
logical
order
into
the
history
of
primeval
society
until
considerably
more
material
is
obtained
no
further
changes
will
be
necessary
and
his
arrangement
will
surely
remain
in
force
of
the
three
main
epochs
savagery
barbarism
and
civilization
naturally
only
the
first
two
and
the
transition
to
the
third
required
his
attention
he
subdivided
each
of
these
into
a
lower
middle
and
higher
stage
according
to
the
progress
in
the
production
of
the
means
of
sustenance
his
reason
for
doing
so
is
that
the
degree
of
human
supremacy
over
nature
is
conditioned
on
the
ability
to
produce
the
necessities
of
life
for
of
all
living
beings
man
alone
has
acquired
an
almost
unlimited
control
over
food
production
all
great
epochs
of
human
progress
according
to
morgan
coincide
more
or
less
directly
with
times
of
greater
abundance
in
the
means
that
sustain
life
the
evolution
of
the
family
proceeds
in
the
same
measure
without
however
offering
equally
convenient
marks
for
savagery
lower
stage
infancy
of
the
human
race
human
beings
still
dwelt
in
their
original
habitation
in
tropical
or
subtropical
forests
they
lived
at
least
part
of
the
time
in
trees
for
only
in
this
way
they
could
escape
the
attacks
of
large
beasts
of
prey
and
survive
fruit
nuts
and
roots
served
as
food
the
formation
of
articulated
speech
is
the
principal
result
of
this
period
not
a
single
one
of
all
the
nations
that
have
become
known
in
historic
times
dates
back
to
this
primeval
stage
although
the
latter
may
extend
over
thousands
of
years
we
have
no
means
of
proving
its
existence
by
direct
evidence
but
once
the
descent
of
man
from
the
animal
kingdom
is
acknowledged
the
acceptance
of
this
stage
of
transition
becomes
inevitable
middle
stage
commencing
with
the
utilization
of
fish
including
crabs
mollusks
and
other
aquatic
animals
and
the
use
of
fire
both
these
things
belong
together
because
fish
becomes
thoroughly
palatable
by
the
help
of
fire
only
with
this
new
kind
of
food
human
beings
became
completely
independent
of
climate
and
locality
following
the
course
of
rivers
and
coastlines
they
could
spread
over
the
greater
part
of
the
earth
even
in
the
savage
state
the
palaeolithic
implements
of
the
early
stone
age
made
of
rough
unsharpened
stones
belong
almost
entirely
to
this
period
their
wide
distribution
over
all
the
continents
testifies
to
the
extent
of
these
wanderings
the
unceasing
bent
for
discovery
together
with
the
possession
of
fire
gained
by
friction
created
new
products
in
the
lately
occupied
regions
such
were
farinaceous
roots
and
tubers
baked
in
hot
ashes
or
in
baking
pits
ground
ovens
when
the
first
weapons
club
and
spear
were
invented
venison
was
occasionally
added
to
the
bill
of
fare
nations
subsisting
exclusively
by
hunting
such
as
we
sometimes
find
mentioned
in
books
have
never
existed
for
the
proceeds
of
hunting
are
too
uncertain
in
consequence
of
continued
precariousness
of
the
sources
of
sustenance
cannibalism
seems
to
arise
at
this
stage
it
continues
in
force
for
a
long
while
even
in
our
day
australians
and
polynesians
still
remain
in
this
middle
stage
of
savagery
higher
stage
coming
with
the
invention
of
bow
and
arrow
this
stage
makes
venison
a
regular
part
of
daily
fare
and
hunting
a
normal
occupation
bow
arrow
and
cord
represent
a
rather
complicated
instrument
the
invention
of
which
presupposes
a
long
and
accumulated
experience
and
increased
mental
ability
incidentally
they
are
conditioned
on
the
acquaintance
with
a
number
of
other
inventions
in
comparing
the
nations
that
are
familiar
with
the
use
of
bow
and
arrow
but
not
yet
with
the
art
of
pottery
from
which
morgan
dates
the
transition
to
barbarism
we
find
among
them
the
beginnings
of
village
settlements
a
control
of
food
production
wooden
vessels
and
utensils
weaving
of
bast
fibre
by
hand
without
a
loom
baskets
made
of
bast
or
reeds
and
sharpened
neolithic
stone
implements
generally
fire
and
the
stone
ax
have
also
furnished
the
dugout
and
here
and
there
timbers
and
boards
for
all
these
improvements
are
found
among
the
american
indians
of
the
northwest
who
use
bow
and
arrows
but
know
nothing
as
yet
about
pottery
bow
and
arrows
were
for
the
stage
of
savagery
what
the
iron
sword
was
for
barbarism
and
the
for
civilization
the
weapon
of
supremacy
ii
barbarism
lower
stage
dates
from
the
introduction
of
the
art
of
pottery
the
latter
is
traceable
in
many
cases
and
probably
attributable
in
all
cases
to
the
custom
of
covering
wooden
or
plaited
vessels
with
clay
in
order
to
render
them
it
did
not
take
long
to
find
out
that
moulded
clay
served
the
same
purpose
without
a
lining
of
other
material
hitherto
we
could
consider
the
course
of
evolution
as
being
equally
characteristic
in
a
general
way
for
all
the
nations
of
a
certain
period
without
reference
to
locality
but
with
the
beginning
of
barbarism
we
reach
a
stage
where
the
difference
in
the
natural
resources
of
the
two
great
bodies
of
land
makes
itself
felt
the
salient
features
of
this
stage
of
barbarism
is
the
taming
and
raising
of
animals
and
the
cultivation
of
plants
now
the
eastern
body
of
land
the
old
world
contained
nearly
all
the
tamable
animals
and
all
the
cultivable
species
of
grain
but
one
while
the
western
continent
america
possessed
only
one
tamable
mammal
the
llama
even
this
only
in
a
certain
part
of
the
south
and
only
one
although
the
best
species
of
grain
the
corn
from
now
on
these
different
conditions
of
nature
lead
the
population
of
each
hemisphere
along
divergent
roads
and
the
landmarks
on
the
boundaries
of
the
various
stages
differ
in
both
cases
middle
stage
commencing
in
the
east
with
the
domestication
of
animals
in
the
west
with
the
cultivation
and
irrigation
of
foodplants
also
with
the
use
of
adobes
bricks
baked
in
the
sun
and
stones
for
buildings
we
begin
in
the
west
because
there
this
stage
was
never
outgrown
up
to
the
time
of
the
conquest
by
europeans
at
the
time
of
their
discovery
the
indians
in
the
lower
stage
of
barbarism
all
those
living
east
of
the
mississippi
carried
on
cultivation
on
a
small
scale
in
gardens
corn
and
perhaps
also
pumpkins
melons
and
other
garden
truck
were
raised
a
very
essential
part
of
their
sustenance
was
produced
in
this
manner
they
lived
in
wooden
houses
in
fortified
villages
the
tribes
of
the
northwest
especially
those
of
the
region
along
the
columbia
river
were
still
in
the
higher
stage
of
savagery
ignorant
of
pottery
and
of
any
cultivation
of
plants
whatever
but
the
pueblo
indians
in
new
mexico
the
mexicans
and
peruvians
were
in
the
of
barbarism
they
lived
in
fortlike
houses
of
adobe
or
stone
cultivated
corn
and
other
plants
suitable
to
various
conditions
of
localities
and
climate
in
artificially
irrigated
gardens
that
represented
the
main
source
of
nourishment
and
even
kept
a
few
tamed
animals
the
mexicans
the
turkey
and
other
birds
the
peruvians
the
llama
furthermore
they
were
familiar
with
the
use
of
metals
iron
excepted
and
for
this
reason
they
could
not
get
along
yet
without
stone
weapons
and
stone
implements
the
conquest
by
the
spaniards
cut
short
all
further
independent
development
in
the
east
the
middle
stage
of
barbarism
began
with
the
taming
of
milk
and
meat
producing
animals
while
the
cultivation
of
plants
seems
to
have
remained
unknown
far
into
this
period
it
appears
that
the
taming
and
raising
of
animals
and
the
formation
of
large
herds
gave
rise
to
the
separation
of
aryans
and
semites
from
the
rest
of
the
barbarians
names
of
animals
are
still
common
to
the
languages
of
european
and
asian
aryans
while
this
is
almost
never
the
case
with
the
names
of
cultivated
plants
in
suitable
localities
the
formation
of
herds
led
to
a
nomadic
life
as
with
the
semites
in
the
grassy
plains
of
the
euphrates
and
tigris
the
aryans
in
the
plains
of
india
of
the
oxus
jaxartes
don
and
dnieper
along
the
borders
of
such
pasture
lands
the
taming
of
animals
must
have
been
accomplished
first
but
later
generations
conceived
the
mistaken
idea
that
the
nomadic
tribes
had
their
origin
in
regions
supposed
to
be
the
cradle
of
humanity
while
in
reality
their
savage
ancestors
and
even
people
in
the
lower
stage
of
barbarism
would
have
found
these
regions
almost
unfit
for
habitation
on
the
other
hand
once
these
barbarians
of
the
middle
stage
were
accustomed
to
nomadic
life
nothing
could
have
induced
them
to
return
voluntarily
from
the
grassy
river
plains
to
the
forests
that
had
been
the
home
of
their
ancestors
even
when
semites
and
aryans
were
forced
further
to
the
north
and
west
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
occupy
the
forest
regions
of
western
asia
and
europe
until
they
were
enabled
by
agriculture
to
feed
their
animals
on
this
less
favorable
soil
and
especially
to
maintain
them
during
the
winter
it
is
more
than
probable
that
the
cultivation
of
grain
was
due
primarily
to
the
demand
for
stock
feed
and
became
an
important
factor
of
human
sustenance
at
a
later
period
the
superior
development
of
aryans
and
semites
is
perhaps
attributable
to
the
copious
meat
and
milk
diet
of
both
races
more
especially
to
the
favorable
influence
of
such
food
on
the
growth
of
children
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
pueblo
indians
of
new
mexico
who
live
on
an
almost
purely
vegetarian
diet
have
a
smaller
brain
than
the
indians
in
the
lower
stage
of
barbarism
who
eat
more
meat
and
fish
at
any
rate
cannibalism
gradually
disappears
at
this
stage
and
is
maintained
only
as
a
religious
observance
or
what
is
here
nearly
identical
as
a
magic
remedy
higher
stage
beginning
with
the
melting
of
iron
ore
and
merging
into
civilization
by
the
invention
of
letter
script
and
its
utilization
for
writing
records
this
stage
which
is
passed
independently
only
on
the
eastern
hemisphere
is
richer
in
improvements
of
production
than
all
preceding
stages
together
it
is
the
stage
of
the
greek
heroes
the
italian
tribes
shortly
before
the
foundation
of
rome
the
germans
of
tacitus
the
norsemen
of
the
viking
age
we
are
here
confronted
for
the
first
time
with
the
iron
ploughshare
drawn
by
animals
rendering
possible
agriculture
on
a
large
scale
in
fields
and
hence
a
practically
unlimited
increase
in
the
production
of
food
for
the
time
being
the
next
consequence
is
the
clearing
of
forests
and
their
transformation
into
arable
land
and
meadows
which
process
however
could
not
be
continued
on
a
larger
scale
without
the
help
of
the
iron
ax
and
the
iron
spade
naturally
these
improvements
brought
a
more
rapid
increase
of
population
and
a
concentration
of
numbers
into
a
small
area
before
the
time
of
field
cultivation
a
combination
of
half
a
million
of
people
under
one
central
management
could
have
been
possible
only
under
exceptionally
favorable
conditions
most
likely
this
was
never
the
case
the
greatest
attainments
of
the
higher
stage
of
barbarism
are
presented
in
homer
poems
especially
in
the
iliad
improved
iron
tools
the
bellows
the
the
potter
wheel
the
preparation
of
oil
and
wine
a
well
developed
fashioning
of
metals
verging
on
artisanship
the
wagon
and
chariot
with
beams
and
boards
the
beginning
of
artistic
architecture
towns
surrounded
by
walls
with
turrets
and
battlements
the
homeric
epos
and
the
entire
mythology
these
are
the
principal
bequests
transmitted
by
the
greeks
from
barbarism
to
civilization
in
comparing
these
attainments
with
the
description
given
by
cesar
or
even
tacitus
of
germans
who
were
in
the
beginning
of
the
same
stage
of
evolution
which
the
greeks
were
preparing
to
leave
for
a
higher
one
we
perceive
the
wealth
of

development
comprised
in
the

stage
of
barbarism
the

which
i
have
here
produced
after

of
the
evolution
of
the
human
race
through
savagery
and
barbarism
to
the
beginning
of

is
even
now
rich
in
new
outlines
more
still
these
outlines
are
incontrovertible
because
traced
directly
from
production
nevertheless
this
sketch
will
appear
faint
and
meagre
in
comparison
to
the
panorama
unrolled
to
our
view
at
the
end
of
our
pilgrimage
not
until
then
will
it
be
possible
to
show
in
their
true
light
both
the
transition
from
barbarianism
to
civilization
and
the
striking
contrast
between
them
for
the
present
we
can
summarize
morgan
arrangement
in
the
following
manner
savagery
time
of
predominating
appropriation
of
finished
natural
products
human
ingenuity
invents
mainly
tools
useful
in
assisting
this
appropriation
barbarism
time
of
acquiring
the
knowledge
of
cattle
raising
of
agriculture
and
of
new
methods
for
increasing
the
productivity
of
nature
by
human
agency
civilization
time
of
learning
a
wider
utilization
of
natural
products
of
manufacturing
and
of

advocates
of

may
of
course
challenge
this
statement
and
show
that
all
the
testimony
of
anthropology
is
not
in
favor
of
the
it
must
also
be
admitted
that
diet
is
not
the
only
essential
factor
in
environment
which
influences
the
development
of
races
and
there
is
no
conclusive
evidence
to
prove
the
absolute
superiority
of
one
diet
over
another
neither
have
we
any
proofs
that
cannibalism
ever
was
in
general
practice
it
rather
seems
to
have
been
confined
to
limited
groups
of
people
in
especially
localities
or
to
times
of
great
scarcity
of
food
hence
we
can
neither
refer
to
cannibalism
as
a
typical
stage
in
human
history
nor
are
we
obliged
to
accept
the
vegetarian
hypothesis
of
a
transition
from
a
meat
diet
to
a
plant
diet

chapter
ii
the
family
morgan
who
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
life
among
the
iroquois
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
who
had
been
adopted
into
one
of
their
tribes
the
senecas
found
among
them
a
system
of
relationship
that
was
in
contradiction
with
their
actual
family
relations
among
them
existed
what
morgan
terms
the
syndyasmian
or
pairing
family
a
monogamous
state
easily
dissolved
by
either
side
the
offspring
of
such
a
couple
was
identified
and
acknowledged
by
all
the
world
there
could
be
no
doubt
to
whom
to
apply
the
terms
father
mother
son
daughter
brother
sister
but
the
actual
use
of
these
words
was
not
in
keeping
with
their
fundamental
meaning
for
the
iroquois
addresses
as
sons
and
daughters
not
only
his
own
children
but
also
those
of
his
brothers
and
he
is
called
father
by
all
of
them
but
the
children
of
his
sisters
he
calls
nephews
and
nieces
and
they
call
him
uncle
vice
versa
an
iroquois
woman
calls
her
own
children
as
well
as
those
of
her
sisters
sons
and
daughters
and
is
addressed
as
mother
by
them
but
the
children
of
her
brothers
are
called
nephews
and
nieces
and
they
call
her
aunt
in
the
same
way
the
children
of
brothers
call
one
another
brothers
and
sisters
and
so
do
the
children
of
sisters
but
the
children
of
a
sister
call
those
of
her
brother
cousins
and
vice
versa
and
these
are
not
simply
meaningless
terms
but
expressions
of
actually
existing
conceptions
of
proximity
and
remoteness
equality
or
inequality
of
consanguinity
these
conceptions
serve
as
the
fundament
of
a
perfectly
elaborated
system
of
relationship
capable
of
expressing
several
hundred
different
relations
of
a
single
individual
more
still
this
system
is
not
only
fully
accepted
by
all
american
indians
no
exception
has
been
found
so
far
but
it
is
also
in
use
with
hardly
any
modifications
among
the
original
inhabitants
of
india
among
the
dravidian
tribes
of
the
dekan
and
the
gaura
tribes
of
hindostan
the
terms
of
relationship
used
by
the
tamils
of
southern
india
and
by
the
of
new
york
state
are
to
this
day
identical
for
more
than
two
hundred
different
family
relations
and
among
these
east
indian
tribes
also
as
among
all
american
indians
the
relations
arising
out
of
the
prevailing
form
of
the
family
are
not
in
keeping
with
the
system
of
kinship
how
can
this
be
explained
in
view
of
the
important
role
played
by
kinship
in
the
social
order
of
all
the
savage
and
barbarian
races
the
significance
of
such
a
widespread
system
can
not
be
obliterated
by
phrases
a
system
that
is
generally
accepted
in
america
that
also
exists
in
asia
among
people
of
entirely
different
races
that
is
frequently
found
in
a
more
or
less
modified
form
all
over
africa
and
australia
such
a
system
requires
a
historical
explanation
and
can
not
be
talked
down
as
was
attempted
by
mclennan
the
terms
father
child
brother
sister
are
more
than
mere
honorary
titles
they
carry
in
their
wake
certain
and
very
serious
obligations
the
aggregate
of
which
comprises
a
very
essential
part
of
the
social
constitution
of
those
nations
and
the
explanation
was
found
in
the
sandwich
islands
hawaii
there
existed
up
to
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
family
form
producing
just
such
fathers
and
mothers
brothers
and
sisters
uncles
and
aunts
nephews
and
nieces
as
the
old
system
of
kinship
but
how
remarkable
the
hawaiian
system
of
kinship
again
did
not
agree
with
the
family
form
actually
prevailing
there
for
there
all
the
children
of
brothers
and
sisters
without
any
exception
are
considered
brothers
and
sisters
and
regarded
as
the
common
children
not
only
of
their
mother
or
her
sisters
or
their
father
and
his
brothers
but
of
all
the
brothers
and
sisters
of
their
parents
without
distinction
while
thus
the
american
system
of
kinship
presupposes
an
obsolete
primitive
form
of
the
family
which
is
still
actually
existing
in
hawaii
the
hawaiian
system
on
the
other
hand
points
to
a
still
more
primitive
form
of
the
family
the
actual
existence
of
which
can
not
be
proved
any
more
but
which
must
have
existed
because
otherwise
such
a
system
of
kinship
could
not
have
arisen
according
to
morgan
the
family
is
the
active
element
it
is
never
stationary
but
in
progression
from
a
lower
to
a
higher
form
in
the
same
measure
in
which
society
develops
from
a
lower
to
a
higher
stage
but
the
systems
of
kinship
are
passive
only
in
long
intervals
they
register
the
progress
made
by
the
family
in
course
of
time
and
only
then
are
they
radically
changed
when
the
family
has
done
so
and
adds
marx
it
is
the
same
with
political
juridical
religious
and
philosophical
systems
in
general
while
the
family
keeps
on
growing
the
system
of
kinship
becomes
ossified
the
latter
continues
in
this
state
and
the
family
grows
beyond
it
with
the
same
certainty
which
enabled
cuvier
to
conclude
from
some
bones
of
marsupialia
found
near
paris
that
extinct
marsupialia
had
lived
there
with
this
same
certainty
may
we
conclude
from
a
system
of
kinship
transmitted
by
history
that
the
extinct
form
of
the
family
corresponding
to
this
system
was
once
in
existence
the
systems
of
kinship
and
forms
of
the
family
just
mentioned
differ
from
the
present
systems
in
that
every
child
has
several
fathers
and
mothers
under
the
american
system
to
which
the
hawaiian
system
corresponds
brother
and
sister
can
not
be
father
and
mother
of
the
same
child
but
the
hawaiian
system
presupposes
a
family
in
which
on
the
contrary
this
was
the
rule
we
are
here
confronted
by
a
series
of
family
forms
that
are
in
direct
contradiction
with
those
that
were
currently
regarded
as
alone
prevailing
the
conventional
conception
knows
only
monogamy
furthermore
polygamy
of
one
man
eventually
also
polyandry
of
one
woman
but
it
passes
in
silence
as
is
meet
for
a
moralizing
philistine
that
the
practice
silently
but
without
compunction
supersedes
these
barriers
sanctioned
officially
by
society
the
study
of
primeval
history
however
shows
us
conditions
where
men
practiced
polygamy
and
women
at
the
same
time
polyandry
so
that
their
children
were
considered
common
to
all
conditions
that
up
to
their
final
transition
into
monogamy
underwent
a
whole
series
of
modifications
these
modifications
slowly
and
gradually
contract
the
circle
comprised
by
the
common
tie
of
marriage
until
only
the
single
couple
remains
which
prevails
in
thus
constructing
backward
the
history
of
the
family
morgan
in
harmony
with
the
majority
of
his
colleagues
arrives
at
a
primeval
condition
where
unrestricted
sexual
intercourse
existed
within
a
tribe
so
that
every
woman
belonged
to
every
man
and
vice
versa
much
has
been
said
about
this
primeval
state
of
affairs
since
the
eighteenth
century
but
only
in
general
commonplaces
it
is
one
of
bachofen
great
merits
to
have
taken
the
subject
seriously
and
to
have
searched
for
traces
of
this
state
in
historical
and
religious
traditions
we
know
that
these
traces
found
by
him
do
not
lead
back
to
a
stage
of
unlimited
sexual
intercourse
but
to
a
much
later
form
the
group
marriage
the
primeval
stage
if
it
really
ever
existed
belongs
to
so
remote
a
period
that
we
can
hardly
expect
to
find
direct
proofs
of
its
former
existence
among
these
social
fossils
backward
savages
bachofen
merit
consists
in
having
brought
this
question
to
the
fore
it
has
lately
become
a
fashion
to
deny
the
existence
of
this
early
stage
of
human
sex
life
in
order
to
spare
us
this
shame
apart
from
the
absence
of
all
direct
proof
the
example
of
the
rest
of
animal
life
is
invoked
from
the
latter
letourneau
evolution
du
mariage
et
de
la
famille
quoted
numerous
facts
alleged
to
prove
that
among
animals
also
an
absolutely
unlimited
sexual
intercourse
belongs
to
a
lower
stage
but
i
can
only
conclude
from
all
these
facts
that
they
prove
absolutely
nothing
for
man
and
the
primeval
conditions
of
his
life
the
mating
of
vertebrates
for
a
lengthy
term
is
sufficiently
explained
by
physiological
causes
among
birds
by
the
helplessness
of
the
female
during
brooding
time
examples
of
faithful
monogamy
among
birds
do
not
furnish
any
proofs
for
men
for
we
are
not
descended
from
birds
and
if
strict
monogamy
is
the
height
of
virtue
then
the
palm
belongs
to
the
tapeworm
that
carries
a
complete
male
and
female
sexual
apparatus
in
each
of
its
to
sections
and
passes
its
whole
lifetime
in
fertilizing
itself
in
every
one
of
its
sections
but
if
we
confine
ourselves
to
mammals
we
find
all
forms
of
sexual
intercourse
license
suggestions
of
group
marriage
polygamy
and
monogamy
only
polyandry
is
missing
that
could
be
accomplished
by
men
only
even
our
next
relations
the
quadrumana
exhibit
all
possible
differences
in
the
grouping
of
males
and
females
and
if
we
draw
the
line
still
closer
and
consider
only
the
four
anthropoid
apes
letourneau
can
only
tell
us
that
they
are
now
monogamous
now
polygamous
while
saussure
contends
according
to
that
they
are
monogamous
the
recent
contentions
of
westermarck
in
regard
to
monogamy
among
anthropoid
apes
are
far
from
proving
anything
in
short
the
information
is
such
that
honest
letourneau
admits
there
exists
no
strict
relation
at
all
between
the
degree
of
intellectual
development
and
the
form
of
sexual
intercourse
among
mammals
and
espinas
says
frankly
the
herd
is
the
highest
social
group
found
among
animals
it
seems
to
be
composed
of
families
but
from
the
outset
the
family
and
the
herd
are
antagonistic
they
develop
in
directly
opposite
ratio
it
is
evident
from
the
above
that
we
know
next
to
nothing
of
the
family
and
other
social
groups
of
anthropoid
apes
the
reports
are
directly
contradictory
how
full
of
contradiction
how
much
in
need
of
critical
scrutiny
and
research
are
the
reports
even
on
savage
human
tribes
but
monkey
tribes
are
far
more
difficult
to
observe
than
human
tribes
for
the
present
therefore
we
must
decline
all
final
conclusions
from
such
absolutely
unreliable
reports
the
quotation
from
espinas
however
offers
a
better
clue
among
higher
animals
the
herd
and
family
are
not
supplements
of
one
another
but
antitheses
espinas
demonstrates
very
nicely
how
the
jealousy
of
the
males
loosens
or
temporarily
dissolves
every
herd
during
mating
time
where
the
family
is
closely
organized
herds
are
formed
only
in
exceptional
cases
but
wherever
free
sexual
intercourse
or
polygamy
are
existing
the
herd
appears
almost
spontaneously
in
order
that
a
herd
may
form
family
ties
must
be
loosened
and
the
individual
be
free
for
this
reason
we
so
rarely
find
organized
herds
among
birds
among
mammals
however
we
find
groups
organized
after
a
fashion
just
because
here
the
individual
is
not
merged
in
the
family
the
rising
sense
of
cohesion
in
a
herd
can
not
therefore
have
a
greater
enemy
than
the
consciousness
of
family
ties
let
us
not
shrink
from
pronouncing
it
the
development
of
a
higher
form
of
society
than
the
family
can
be
due
only
to
the
fact
that
it
admitted
families
which
had
undergone
a
thorough
change
this
does
not
exclude
the
possibility
that
these
same
families
were
thus
enabled
to
reorganize
later
on
under
infinitely
more
favorable
circumstances
it
becomes
apparent
from
this
that
animal
societies
may
indeed
have
a
certain
value
in
drawing
conclusions
in
regard
to
human
life
but
only
negatively
the
higher
vertebrate
knows
so
far
as
we
may
ascertain
only
two
forms
of
the
family
polygamy
or
pairs
in
both
of
them
there
is
only
one
grown
male
only
one
husband
the
jealousy
of
the
male
at
the
same
time
tie
and
limit
of
the
family
creates
an
opposition
between
the
animal
family
and
the
herd
the
latter
a
higher
social
form
is
here
rendered
impossible
there
loosened
or
dissolved
during
mating
time
and
at
best
hindered
in
its
development
by
the
jealousy
of
the
male
this
in
itself
is
sufficient
proof
that
the
animal
family
and
primeval
human
society
are
irreconcilable
that
ancient
man
struggling
upward
from
the
animal
stage
either
had
no
family
at
all
or
at
the
most
one
that
does
not
exist
among
animals
a
being
so
defenceless
as
evolving
man
might
well
survive
in
small
numbers
though
living
in
an
isolated
state
the
highest
social
form
of
which
is
that
of
pairs
such
as
westermarck
relying
on
hunter
reports
attributes
to
the
gorilla
and
the
chimpanzee
another
element
is
necessary
for
the
elevation
out
of
the
animal
stage
for
the
realization
of
the
highest
progress
found
in
nature
the
replacing
of
the
defencelessness
of
the
single
individual
by
the
united
strength
and
of
the
whole
herd
the
transition
from
beast
to
man
out
of
conditions
of
the
sort
under
which
the
anthropoid
apes
are
living
would
be
absolutely
unexplainable
these
apes
rather
give
the
impression
of
stray
sidelines
gradually
approaching
extinction
and
at
all
events
in
process
of
decline
this
alone
is
sufficient
to
reject
all
parallels
between
their
family
forms
and
those
of
primeval
man
but
mutual
tolerance
of
the
grown
males
freedom
from
jealousy
was
the
first
condition
for
the
formation
of
such
large
and
permanent
groups
within
which
alone
the
transformation
from
beast
to
man
could
be
accomplished
and
indeed
what
do
we
find
to
be
the
most
ancient
and
original
form
of
the
family
undeniably
traceable
by
history
and
even
found
here
and
there
the
group
marriage
that
form
in
which
whole
groups
of
men
and
whole
groups
of
women
mutually
belong
to
one
another
leaving
only
small
scope
for
jealousy
and
furthermore
we
find
at
a
later
stage
the
exceptional
form
of
polyandry
which
still
more
supersedes
all
sentiments
of
jealousy
and
hence
is
unknown
to
animals
but
all
the
forms
of
the
group
marriage
known
to
us
are
accompanied
by
such
peculiarly
complicated
circumstances
that
they
of
necessity
point
to
a
preceding
simpler
form
of
sexual
intercourse
and
hence
in
the
last
instance
to
a
period
of
unrestricted
sexual
intercourse
corresponding
to
a
transition
from
the
animal
to
man
therefore
the
references
to
animal
marriages
lead
us
back
to
precisely
that
point
from
which
they
were
intended
to
remove
us
forever
what
does
the
term
unrestricted
sexual
intercourse
mean
simply
that
the
restrictions
in
force
now
were
not
observed
formerly
we
have
already
seen
the
barrier
of
jealousy
falling
if
anything
is
certain
it
is
that
jealousy
is
developed
at
a
comparatively
late
stage
the
same
is
true
of
incest
not
only
brother
and
sister
were
originally
man
and
wife
but
also
the
sexual
intercourse
between
parents
and
children
is
permitted
to
this
day
among
many
nations
bancroft
testifies
to
the
truth
of
this
among
the
kaviats
of
the
behring
strait
the
kadiaks
of
alaska
the
tinnehs
in
the
interior
of
british
north
america
letourneau
compiled
reports
of
the
same
fact
in
regard
to
the
chippeway
indians
the
coocoos
in
chile
the
caribeans
the
carens
in
not
to
mention
the
tales
of
ancient
greeks
and
romans
about
the
parthians
persians
scythians
huns
and
so
forth
before
incest
was
invented
and
it
is
an
invention
a
really
valuable
one
indeed
sexual
intercourse
between
parents
and
children
could
not
be
any
more
repulsive
than
between
other
persons
belonging
to
different
generations
which
takes
place
even
in
our
day
among
the
most
nations
without
causing
any
horror
even
old
maids
of
more
than
sixty
years
sometimes
if
they
are
rich
enough
marry
young
men
of
about
thirty
eliminating
from
the
primeval
forms
of
the
family
known
to
us
those
conceptions
of
incest
conceptions
totally
different
from
ours
and
often
enough
in
direct
contradiction
with
them
we
arrive
at
a
form
of
sexual
intercourse
that
can
only
be
designated
as
unrestricted
unrestricted
in
the
sense
that
the
barriers
drawn
later
on
by
custom
did
not
yet
exist
this
in
no
way
necessarily
implies
for
practical
purposes
an
injudicious
intercourse
the
separate
existence
of
pairs
for
a
limited
time
is
not
out
of
the
question
and
even
comprises
the
majority
of
cases
in
the
group
marriage
of
our
days
and
if
the
latest
repudiator
of
such
a
primeval
state
westermarck
designates
as
marriage
every
case
where
both
sexes
remain
mated
until
the
birth
of
the
offspring
then
this
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
this
kind
of
marriage
may
well
exist
during
a
stage
of
unrestricted
intercourse
without
contradicting
license
absence
of
barriers
drawn
by
custom
for
sexual
intercourse
westermarck
bases
himself
on
the
opinion
that
license
includes
the
suppression
of
individual
affections
so
that
prostitution
is
its
most
genuine
form
to
me
it
rather
seems
that
any
understanding
of
primeval
conditions
is
impossible
as
long
as
we
look
at
them
through
brothel
spectacles
we
shall
return
to
this
point
in
the
group
marriage
according
to
morgan
the
following
forms
developed
from
this
primeval
state
at
an
apparently
early
stage
the
consanguine
family
the
consanguine
family
is
the
first
step
toward
the
family
here
the
marriage
groups
are
arranged
by
generations
all
the
and
within
a
certain
family
are
mutually
husbands
and
wives
and
equally
their
children
the
fathers
and
mothers
whose
children
form
a
third
cycle
of
mutual
mates
the
children
of
these
again
the
of
the
first
cycle
will
form
a
fourth
in
this
form
of
the
family
then
only
ancestors
and
descendants
are
excluded
from
what
we
would
call
the
rights
and
duties
of
marriage
brothers
and
sisters
male
and
female
cousins
of
the
first
second
and
more
remote
grades
are
all
mutually
brothers
and
sisters
and
for
this
reason
mutual
husbands
and
wives
the
relation
of
brother
and
sister
quite
naturally
includes
at
this
stage
the
practice
of
sexual
intercourse
the
typical
form
of
such
a
family
would
consist
of
the
offspring
of
one
pair
representing
again
the
descendants
of
each
grade
as
mutual
brothers
and
sisters
and
therefore
mutual
husbands
and
wives
the
consanguine
family
is
extinct
even
the
crudest
nations
of
history
do
not
furnish
any
proofs
of
it
but
the
hawaiian
system
of
kinship
in
force
to
this
day
in
all
polynesia
compels
us
to
acknowledge
its
former
existence
for
it
exhibits
grades
of
kinship
that
could
only
originate
in
this
form
of
the
family
and
the
whole
subsequent
development
of
the
family
compels
us
to
admit
this
form
as
a
necessary
step
the
punaluan
family
while
the
first
step
of
organization
consisted
in
excluding
parents
and
children
from
mutual
sexual
intercourse
the
second
was
the
erection
of
a
barrier
between
brother
and
sister
this
progress
was
much
more
important
on
account
of
the
greater
equality
in
the
ages
of
the
parties
concerned
but
also
far
more
difficult
it
was
accomplished
gradually
probably
beginning
with
the
exclusion
of
the
natural
sister
on
the
mother
side
from
sexual
intercourse
first
in
single
cases
then
becoming
more
and
more
the
rule
in
hawaii
exceptions
were
still
noted
during
the
nineteenth
century
and
finally
ending
with
the
prohibition
of
marriage
even
among
collateral
brothers
and
sisters
what
we
now
term
brother
and
sister
children
grandchildren
and
this
progress
offers
according
to
morgan
an
excellent
illustration
how
the
principle
of
natural
selection
works
without
question
the
tribes
limiting
inbreeding
by
this
progress
developed
faster
and
more
completely
than
those
retaining
the
marriage
between
brothers
and
sisters
as
a
rule
and
law
and
how
powerfully
the
influence
of
this
progress
was
felt
is
shown
by
the
institution
of
the
gens
directly
attributable
to
it
and
passing
far
beyond
the
goal
the
gens
is
the
foundation
of
the
social
order
of
most
if
not
all
barbarian
nations
and
in
greece
and
rome
we
step
immediately
from
it
to
civilization
every
primeval
family
necessarily
had
to
divide
after
a
few
generations
the
originally
communistic
and
collective
household
existing
far
into
the
middle
stage
of
barbarism
involved
a
certain
maximum
size
of
the
family
variable
according
to
conditions
but
still
limited
in
a
degree
as
soon
as
the
conception
of
the
impropriety
of
sexual
intercourse
between
children
of
the
same
mother
arose
it
naturally
became
effective
on
such
occasions
as
the
division
of
old
and
the
foundation
of
new
household
communities
which
however
did
not
necessarily
coincide
with
the
family
group
one
or
more
series
of
sisters
became
the
center
of
one
group
their
natural
brothers
that
of
another
in
this
or
a
similar
manner
that
form
which
morgan
styles
the
punaluan
family
developed
from
the
consanguine
family
according
to
hawaiian
custom
a
number
of
sisters
natural
or
more
remote
cousins
of
the
first
second
and
more
remote
degrees
were
the
mutual
wives
of
their
mutual
husbands
their
natural
brothers
excepted
these
men
now
no
longer
addressed
one
another
as
brother
which
they
no
longer
had
to
be
but
as
punalua
intimate
companion
associate
as
it
were
likewise
a
series
of
natural
or
more
remote
brothers
lived
in
mutual
marriage
with
a
number
of
women
not
their
natural
sisters
and
these
women
referred
to
each
other
as
punalua
this
is
the
classical
form
of
a
family
which
later
admitted
of
certain
variations
its
fundamental
characteristic
was
mutual
community
of
husbands
and
wives
within
a
given
family
with
the
exclusion
of
the
natural
brothers
or
sisters
first
and
of
the
more
remote
grades
later
this
form
of
the
family
now
furnishes
with
complete
accuracy
the
degrees
of
kinship
expressed
by
the
american
system
the
children
of
the
sisters
of
my
mother
still
are
her
children
likewise
the
children
of
the
brothers
of
my
father
still
his
children
and
all
of
them
are
my
brothers
and
sisters
but
the
children
of
the
brothers
of
my
mother
are
now
her
nephews
and
nieces
the
children
of
the
sisters
of
my
father
his
nephew
and
nieces
and
they
are
all
my
cousins
for
while
the
husbands
of
the
sisters
of
my
mother
are
still
her
husbands
and
likewise
the
wives
of
the
brothers
of
my
father
still
his
wives
legally
if
not
always
in
fact
the
social
proscription
of
sexual
intercourse
between
brothers
and
sisters
has
now
divided
those
relatives
who
were
formerly
regarded
without
distinction
as
brothers
and
sisters
into
two
classes
in
one
category
are
those
who
remain
more
remote
brothers
and
sisters
as
before
in
the
other
the
children
of
the
brother
on
one
hand
or
the
sister
on
the
opposite
who
can
be
brothers
and
sisters
no
longer
the
latter
have
mutual
parents
no
more
neither
father
nor
mother
nor
both
together
and
for
this
reason
the
class
of
nephews
and
nieces
male
and
female
cousins
here
becomes
necessary
for
the
first
time
under
the
former
family
order
this
would
have
been
absurd
the
american
system
of
kinship
which
appears
absolutely
paradoxical
in
any
family
form
founded
on
monogamy
is
rationally
explained
and
naturally
confirmed
in
its
most
minute
details
by
the
punaluan
family
wherever
this
system
of
kinship
was
in
force
there
the
punaluan
family
or
at
least
a
form
akin
to
it
must
also
have
existed
this
family
form
the
existence
of
which
in
hawaii
was
actually
demonstrated
would
have
been
transmitted
probably
by
all
polynesia
if
the
pious
missionaries
similar
to
the
spanish
monks
in
america
could
have
looked
upon
such
relations
as
being
something
more
than
simply
a
horror
cesar
report
to
the
effect
that
the
britons
who
then
were
in
the
middle
stage
of
barbarism
have
ten
or
twelve
women
in
common
mostly
brothers
with
brothers
and
parents
with
children
is
best
explained
by
group
marriage
barbarian
mothers
have
not
ten
or
twelve
sons
old
enough
to
keep
women
in
common
but
the
american
system
of
kinship
corresponding
to
the
punaluan
family
furnishes
many
brothers
because
all
near
and
remote
cousins
of
a
certain
man
are
his
brothers
the
term
parents
with
children
may
arise
from
a
wrong
conception
of
cesar
but
this
system
does
not
absolutely
exclude
the
existence
of
father
and
son
mother
or
daughter
in
the
same
group
it
does
exclude
however
father
and
daughter
or
mother
and
son
this
or
a
similar
form
of
group
marriage
also
furnishes
the
easiest
explanation
of
the
reports
of
herodotus
and
other
ancient
writers
concerning
community
of
women
among
savage
and
barbarian
nations
this
is
true
furthermore
of
watson
and
kaye
tale
about
the
tikurs
of
audh
north
of
the
ganges
they
live
together
sexually
almost
indiscriminately
in
large
communities
and
though
two
persons
may
be
considered
as
being
married
still
the
tie
is
only
nominal
the
institution
of
the
gens
seems
to
have
its
origin
in
the
majority
of
cases
in
the
punaluan
family
true
the
australian
class
system
also
offers
a
starting
point
for
it
the
australians
have
gentes
but
not
yet
a
punaluan
family
only
a
cruder
form
of
group
marriage
in
all
forms
of
the
group
family
it
is
uncertain
who
is
the
father
of
a
child
but
certain
who
is
its
mother
although
she
calls
all
the
children
of
the
aggregate
family
her
children
and
has
the
duties
of
a
mother
toward
them
still
she
knows
her
natural
children
from
others
it
is
also
obvious
that
as
far
as
group
marriage
exists
descent
can
only
be
traced
on
the
mother
side
and
hence
only
female
lineage
be
acknowledged
this
is
actually
the
case
among
all
savage
tribes
and
those
in
the
lower
stage
of
barbarism
to
have
discovered
this
first
is
the
second
great
merit
of
bachofen
he
designates
this
exclusive
recognition
of
descent
from
the
female
line
and
the
hereditary
relations
resulting
therefrom
in
course
of
time
as
maternal
law
i
retain
this
term
for
the
sake
of
brevity
although
it
is
distorted
for
at
this
social
stage
there
is
no
sign
yet
of
any
law
in
the
juridic
sense
if
we
now
take
one
of
the
two
standard
groups
of
a
punaluan
family
namely
that
of
a
series
of
natural
and
remote
sisters
first
second
and
more
remote
descendants
of
natural
sisters
their
children
and
their
natural
or
remote
brothers
on
the
mother
side
who
according
to
our
supposition
are
not
their
husbands
we
have
exactly
that
circle
of
persons
who
later
appear
as
members
of
a
gens
in
the
original
form
of
this
institution
they
all
have
a
common
ancestress
by
virtue
of
the
descent
that
makes
the
different
female
generations
sisters
but
the
husbands
of
these
sisters
can
not
be
chosen
among
their
brothers
any
more
can
no
longer
come
from
the
same
ancestress
and
do
not
therefore
belong
to
the
consanguineous
group
of
relatives
the
gens
of
a
later
time
the
children
of
these
same
sisters
however
do
belong
to
this
group
because
descent
from
the
female
line
alone
is
conclusive
alone
is
positive
as
soon
as
the
proscription
of
sexual
intercourse
between
all
relatives
on
the
mother
side
even
the
most
remote
of
them
is
an
accomplished
fact
the
above
named
group
has
become
a
gens
constitutes
a
definite
circle
of
consanguineous
relatives
of
female
lineage
who
are
not
permitted
to
marry
one
another
henceforth
this
circle
is
more
and
more
fortified
by
other
mutual
institutions
of
a
social
or
religious
character
and
thus
distinguished
from
other
gentes
of
the
same
tribe
of
this
more
anon
finding
as
we
do
that
the
gens
not
only
necessarily
but
also
as
a
matter
of
course
develops
from
the
punaluan
family
it
becomes
obvious
to
us
to
assume
as
almost
practically
demonstrated
the
prior
existence
of
this
family
form
among
all
those
nations
where
such
gentes
are
traceable
nearly
all
barbarian
and
civilized
nations
when
morgan
wrote
his
book
our
knowledge
of
group
marriage
was
very
limited
we
knew
very
little
about
the
group
marriages
of
the
australians
organized
in
classes
and
furthermore
morgan
had
published
as
early
as
the
information
he
had
received
about
the
punaluan
family
of
hawaii
this
family
on
one
hand
furnished
a
complete
explanation
of
the
system
of
kinship
in
force
among
the
american
indians
which
had
been
the
point
of
departure
for
all
the
studies
of
morgan
on
the
other
hand
it
formed
a
ready
means
for
the
deduction
of
the
maternal
law
gens
and
finally
it
represented
a
far
higher
stage
of
development
than
the
australian
classes
it
is
therefore
easy
to
understand
how
morgan
could
regard
this
form
as
the
stage
necessarily
preceding
the
pairing
family
and
attribute
general
extension
in
former
times
to
it
since
then
we
have
learned
of
several
other
forms
of
the
group
marriage
and
we
know
that
morgan
went
too
far
in
this
respect
but
it
was
nevertheless
his
good
fortune
to
encounter
in
his
punaluan
family
the
highest
the
classical
form
of
group
marriage
that
form
which
gave
the
simplest
clue
for
the
transition
to
a
higher
stage
the
most
essential
contribution
to
our
knowledge
of
the
group
marriage
we
owe
to
the
english
missionary
lorimer
fison
who
studied
this
form
of
the
family
for
years
on
its
classical
ground
australia
he
found
the
lowest
stage
of
development
among
the
papuans
near
mount
gambier
in
south
australia
here
the
whole
tribe
is
divided
into
two
great
classes
kroki
and
kumite
sexual
intercourse
within
each
of
these
classes
is
strictly
prohibited
but
every
man
of
one
class
is
by
birth
the
husband
of
every
woman
of
the
other
class
and
vice
versa
not
the
individuals
are
married
to
one
another
but
the
whole
groups
class
to
class
and
mark
well
no
caution
is
made
anywhere
on
account
of
difference
of
age
or
special
consanguinity
unless
it
is
resulting
from
the
division
into
two
exogamous
classes
a
kroki
has
for
his
wife
every
kumite
woman
and
as
his
own
daughter
being
the
daughter
of
a
kumite
woman
is
also
kumite
according
to
maternal
law
she
is
therefore
the
born
wife
of
every
kroki
including
her
father
at
least
the
class
organization
as
we
know
it
does
not
exclude
this
possibility
hence
this
organization
either
arose
at
a
time
when
in
spite
of
all
dim
endeavor
to
limit
inbreeding
sexual
intercourse
between
parents
and
children
was
not
yet
regarded
with
any
particular
horror
in
this
case
the
class
system
would
be
directly
evolved
from
a
condition
of
unrestricted
sexual
relations
or
the
intercourse
between
parents
and
children
was
already
proscribed
by
custom
when
the
classes
were
formed
and
in
this
case
the
present
condition
points
back
to
the
consanguine
family
and
is
the
first
step
out
of
it
the
latter
case
is
the
more
probable
so
far
as
i
know
no
mention
is
made
of
any
sexual
intercourse
between
parents
and
children
in
australia
even
the
later
form
of
exogamy
the
maternal
law
gens
as
a
rule
silently
presupposes
that
the
prohibition
of
this
intercourse
was
an
accomplished
fact
at
the
time
of
its
institution
the
system
of
two
classes
is
not
only
found
near
mount
gambier
in
south
australia
but
also
farther
east
along
darling
river
and
in
the
northeast
of
queensland
it
is
consequently
widespread
it
excludes
only
marriage
between
brothers
and
sisters
between
brothers
children
and
between
sisters
children
of
the
mother
side
because
these
belong
to
the
same
class
but
the
children
of
a
sister
can
marry
those
of
a
brother
and
vice
versa
a
further
step
for
preventing
inbreeding
is
found
among
the
kamilaroi
on
the
darling
river
in
new
south
wales
where
the
two
original
classes
are
split
into
four
and
every
one
of
these
is
married
as
a
whole
to
a
certain
other
class
the
first
two
classes
are
husbands
and
wives
by
birth
according
to
the
place
of
the
mother
in
the
first
or
second
class
the
children
belong
to
the
third
and
fourth
the
children
of
these
two
classes
who
are
also
married
to
one
another
again
belong
to
the
first
and
second
class
so
that
a
certain
generation
belongs
to
the
first
and
second
class
the
next
to
the
third
and
fourth
and
the
following
again
to
the
first
and
second
hence
the
children
of
natural
brothers
and
sisters
on
the
mother
side
can
not
marry
one
another
but
their
grandchildren
can
do
so
this
peculiarly
complicated
order
of
things
is
still
more
entangled
by
the
inoculation
evidently
at
a
later
stage
with
maternal
law
gentes
but
we
can
not
discuss
this
further
enough
the
desire
to
prevent
inbreeding
again
and
again
demands
recognition
but
feeling
its
way
quite
spontaneously
without
a
clear
conception
of
the
goal
the
group
marriage
is
represented
in
australia
by
class
marriage
mass
marriage
of
a
whole
class
of
men
frequently
scattered
over
the
whole
breadth
of
the
continent
to
an
equally
widespread
class
of
women
a
close
view
of
this
group
marriage
does
not
offer
quite
such
a
horrible
spectacle
as
the
philistine
imagination
accustomed
to
brothel
conditions
generally
pictures
to
itself
on
the
contrary
long
years
passed
before
its
existence
was
even
suspected
and
quite
recently
it
is
once
more
denied
to
the
casual
observer
it
makes
the
impression
of
a
loose
monogamy
and
in
certain
places
of
polygamy
with
occasional
breach
of
faith
years
are
required
before
one
can
discover
like
fison
and
howitt
the
law
regulating
these
marital
conditions
that
rather
appeal
in
their
practicability
to
the
average
european
the
law
enabling
the
strange
papuan
thousands
of
miles
from
his
home
and
among
people
whose
language
he
does
not
understand
to
find
frequently
from
camp
to
camp
and
from
tribe
to
tribe
women
who
will
without
resistance
and
guilelessly
surrender
to
him
the
law
according
to
which
a
man
with
several
women
offers
one
to
his
guest
for
the
night
where
the
european
sees
immorality
and
lawlessness
there
in
reality
a
strict
law
is
observed
the
women
belong
to
the
marriage
class
of
the
stranger
and
therefore
they
are
his
wives
by
birth
the
same
moral
law
assigning
both
to
one
another
forbids
under
penalty
of
proscription
all
sexual
intercourse
outside
of
the
two
marriage
classes
even
when
women
are
abducted
as
is
frequently
the
case
in
certain
regions
the
class
law
is
carefully
respected
in
the
abduction
of
women
by
the
way
a
trace
of
transition
to
monogamy
is
found
even
here
at
least
in
the
form
of
the
pairing
family
if
a
young
man
has
abducted
a
girl
with
the
help
of
his
friends
they
hold
sexual
intercourse
with
her
one
after
another
but
after
that
the
girl
is
regarded
as
the
wife
of
the
young
man
who
planned
the
abduction
and
again
if
an
abducted
woman
deserts
her
husband
and
is
caught
by
another
man
she
becomes
the
wife
of
the
latter
and
the
first
has
lost
his
privilege
alongside
of
and
within
the
generally
existing
group
marriage
such
exclusive
relations
are
formed
pairing
for
a
shorter
or
longer
term
by
the
side
of
polygamy
so
that
here
also
group
marriage
is
declining
the
question
is
only
which
will
first
disappear
under
the
pressure
of
european
influence
group
marriage
or
the
papuans
addicted
to
it
the
marriage
in
whole
classes
such
as
is
in
force
in
australia
is
no
doubt
a
very
low
and
primitive
form
of
group
marriage
while
the
punaluan
family
so
far
as
we
know
is
its
highest
stage
of
development
the
former
seems
to
be
corresponding
to
the
social
stage
of
roving
savages
the
latter
requires
relatively
settled
communistic
bodies
and
leads
directly
to
the
next
higher
stage
of
development
between
these
two
we
shall
no
doubt
find
many
an
intermediate
stage
here
lies
a
barely
opened
hardly
entered
field
of
investigation
the
pairing
family
a
certain
pairing
for
a
longer
or
shorter
term
took
place
even
during
the
group
marriage
or
still
earlier
a
man
had
his
principal
wife
one
can
hardly
call
it
favorite
wife
as
yet
among
many
women
and
he
was
to
her
the
principal
husband
among
others
this
fact
in
no
small
degree
contributed
to
the
confusion
among
missionaries
who
regarded
group
marriage
now
as
a
disorderly
community
of
women
now
as
an
arbitrary
adultery
such
a
habitual
pairing
would
gain
ground
the
more
the
gens
developed
and
the
more
numerous
the
classes
of
brothers
and
sisters
became
who
were
not
permitted
to
marry
one
another
the
impulse
to
prevent
marriage
of
consanguineous
relatives
started
by
the
gens
went
still
further
thus
we
find
that
among
the
iroquois
and
most
of
the
indians
in
the
lower
stage
of
barbarism
marriage
is
prohibited
between
all
the
relatives
of
their
system
of
kinship
and
this
comprises
several
hundred
kinds
by
this
increasing
complication
of
marriage
restrictions
group
marriage
became
more
and
more
impossible
it
was
displaced
by
the
pairing
family
at
this
stage
one
man
lives
with
one
woman
but
in
such
a
manner
that
polygamy
and
occasional
adultery
remain
privileges
of
men
although
the
former
occurs
rarely
for
economic
reasons
women
however
are
generally
expected
to
be
strictly
faithful
during
the
time
of
living
together
and
adultery
on
their
part
is
cruelly
punished
but
the
may
be
easily
broken
by
either
party
and
the
children
belong
to
the
mother
alone
as
formerly
in
this
ever
more
extending
restriction
of
marriage
between
consanguineous
relations
natural
selection
also
remains
effective
as
morgan
expresses
it
marriages
between
gentes
that
were
not
consanguineous
produced
a
more
vigorous
race
physically
and
mentally
two
progressive
tribes
intermarried
and
the
new
skulls
and
brains
naturally
expanded
until
they
comprised
the
faculties
of
both
thus
tribes
composed
of
gentes
necessarily
either
gained
the
supremacy
over
the
backward
ones
or
by
their
example
carried
them
along
in
their
wake
the
development
of
the
family
then
is
founded
on
the
continual
contraction
of
the
circle
originally
comprising
the
whole
tribe
within
which
marital
intercourse
between
both
sexes
was
general
by
the
continual
exclusion
first
of
near
then
of
ever
remoter
relatives
including
finally
even
those
who
were
simply
related
legally
all
group
marriage
becomes
practically
impossible
at
last
only
one
couple
temporarily
and
loosely
united
remains
that
molecule
the
dissolution
of
which
absolutely
puts
an
end
to
marriage
even
from
this
we
may
infer
how
little
the
sexual
love
of
the
individual
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
word
had
to
do
with
the
origin
of
monogamy
the
practice
of
all
nations
of
that
stage
still
more
proves
this
while
in
the
previous
form
of
the
family
the
men
were
never
embarrassed
for
women
but
rather
had
more
than
enough
of
them
women
now
became
scarce
and
were
sought
after
with
the
pairing
family
therefore
the
abduction
and
barter
of
women
began
widespread
symptoms
and
nothing
but
that
of
a
new
and
much
more
profound
change
the
pedantic
scot
mclennan
however
transmuted
these
symptoms
mere
methods
of
obtaining
women
into
separate
classes
of
the
family
under
the
head
of
marriage
by
capture
and
marriage
by
barter
moreover
among
american
indians
and
other
nations
in
the
same
stage
the
marriage
agreement
is
not
the
business
of
the
parties
most
concerned
who
often
are
not
even
asked
but
of
their
mothers
frequently
two
persons
entirely
unknown
to
one
another
are
thus
engaged
to
be
married
and
receive
no
information
of
the
closing
of
the
bargain
until
the
time
for
the
marriage
ceremony
approaches
before
the
wedding
the
bridegroom
brings
gifts
to
the
maternal
relatives
of
the
bride
not
to
her
father
or
his
relatives
as
an
equivalent
for
ceding
the
girl
to
him
either
of
the
married
parties
may
dissolve
the
marriage
at
will
but
among
many
tribes
as
the
iroquois
public
opinion
has
gradually
become
averse
to
such
separations
in
case
of
domestic
differences
the
gentile
relatives
of
both
parties
endeavor
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
and
not
until
they
are
unsuccessful
a
separation
takes
place
in
this
case
the
woman
keeps
the
children
and
both
parties
are
free
to
marry
again
the
pairing
family
being
too
weak
and
too
unstable
to
make
an
independent
household
necessary
or
even
desirable
in
no
way
dissolves
the
traditional
communistic
way
of
housekeeping
but
household
communism
implies
supremacy
of
women
in
the
house
as
surely
as
exclusive
recognition
of
a
natural
mother
and
the
consequent
impossibility
of
identifying
the
natural
father
signify
high
esteem
for
women
mothers
it
is
one
of
the
most
absurd
notions
derived
from
eighteenth
century
enlightenment
that
in
the
beginning
of
society
woman
was
the
slave
of
man
among
all
savages
and
barbarians
of
the
lower
and
middle
stages
sometimes
even
of
the
higher
stage
women
not
only
have
freedom
but
are
held
in
high
esteem
what
they
were
even
in
the
pairing
family
let
arthur
wright
for
many
years
a
missionary
among
the
seneca
iroquois
testify
as
to
their
families
at
a
time
when
they
still
lived
in
their
old
long
houses
communistic
households
of
several
families
a
certain
clan
gens
always
reigned
so
that
the
women
choose
their
husbands
from
other
clans
gentes
the
female
part
generally
ruled
the
house
the
provisions
were
held
in
common
but
woe
to
the
luckless
husband
or
lover
who
was
too
indolent
or
too
clumsy
to
contribute
his
share
to
the
common
stock
no
matter
how
many
children
or
how
much
private
property
he
had
in
the
house
he
was
liable
at
any
moment
to
receive
a
hint
to
gather
up
his
belongings
and
get
out
and
he
could
not
dare
to
venture
any
resistance
the
house
was
made
too
hot
for
him
and
he
had
no
other
choice
but
to
return
to
his
own
clan
gens
or
as
was
mostly
the
case
to
look
for
another
wife
in
some
other
clan
the
women
were
the
dominating
power
in
the
clans
gentes
and
everywhere
else
occasionally
they
did
not
hesitate
to
dethrone
a
chief
and
degrade
him
to
a
common
warrior
the
communistic
household
in
which
most
or
all
the
women
belong
to
one
and
the
same
gens
while
the
husbands
come
from
different
gentes
is
the
cause
and
foundation
of
the
general
and
widespread
supremacy
of
women
in
primeval
times
the
discovery
of
this
fact
is
the
third
merit
of
bachofen
by
way
of
supplement
i
wish
to
state
that
the
reports
of
travelers
and
missionaries
concerning
the
overburdening
of
women
among
savages
and
barbarians
do
not
in
the
least
contradict
the
above
statements
the
division
of
labor
between
both
sexes
is
caused
by
other
reasons
than
the
social
condition
of
women
nations
where
women
have
to
work
much
harder
than
is
proper
for
them
in
our
opinion
often
respect
women
more
highly
than
europeans
do
the
lady
of
civilized
countries
surrounded
with
sham
homage
and
a
stranger
to
all
real
work
stands
on
a
far
lower
social
level
than
a
barbarian
woman
regarded
as
a
real
lady
and
having
the
character
of
such
whether
or
not
the
pairing
family
has
in
our
time
entirely
supplanted
group
marriage
in
america
can
be
decided
only
by
closer
investigations
among
those
nations
of
northwestern
and
especially
of
southern
america
that
are
still
in
the
higher
stage
of
savagery
about
the
latter
so
many
reports
of
sexual
license
are
current
that
the
assumption
of
a
complete
cessation
of
the
ancient
group
marriage
is
hardly
warranted
evidently
all
traces
of
it
have
not
yet
disappeared
in
at
least
forty
north
american
tribes
the
man
marrying
an
elder
sister
has
the
right
to
make
all
her
sisters
his
wives
as
soon
as
they
are
of
age
a
survival
of
the
community
of
men
for
the
whole
series
of
sisters
and
bancroft
relates
that
the
indians
of
the
californian
peninsula
celebrate
certain
festivities
uniting
several
tribes
for
the
purpose
of
unrestricted
sexual
intercourse
these
are
evidently
gentes
that
have
preserved
in
these
festivities
a
vague
recollection
of
the
time
when
the
women
of
one
gens
had
for
their
common
husbands
all
the
men
of
another
gens
and
vice
versa
the
same
custom
is
still
observed
in
australia
among
certain
nations
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
older
men
the
chief
and
exploit
the
community
of
women
for
their
own
benefits
and
monopolize
all
the
women
but
in
their
turn
they
must
restore
the
old
community
during
certain
festivities
and
great
assemblies
permitting
their
wives
to
enjoy
themselves
with
the
young
men
a
whole
series
of
examples
of
such
periodical
saturnalia
restoring
for
a
short
time
the
ancient
sexual
freedom
is
quoted
by
westermarck
among
the
hos
the
santals
the
punjas
and
kotars
in
india
among
some
african
nations
etc
curiously
enough
westermarck
concludes
that
this
is
a
survival
not
of
group
marriage
the
existence
of
which
he
denies
but
of
a
rutting
season
which
primitive
man
had
in
common
with
other
animals
here
we
touch
bachofen
fourth
great
discovery
the
widespread
form
of
transition
from
group
marriage
to
pairing
family
what
bachofen
represents
as
a
penance
for
violating
the
old
divine
laws
the
penalty
with
which
a
woman
redeems
her
right
to
chastity
is
in
fact
only
a
mystical
expression
for
the
penalty
paid
by
a
woman
for
becoming
exempt
from
the
ancient
community
of
men
and
acquiring
the
right
of
surrendering
to
one
man
only
this
penalty
consists
in
a
limited
surrender
babylonian
women
had
to
surrender
once
a
year
in
the
temple
of
mylitta
other
nations
of
western
asia
sent
their
young
women
for
years
to
the
temple
of
anaitis
where
they
had
to
practice
free
love
with
favorites
of
their
own
choice
before
they
were
allowed
to
marry
similar
customs
in
a
religious
disguise
are
common
to
nearly
all
asiatic
nations
between
the
mediterranean
and
the
ganges
the
penalty
for
exemption
becomes
gradually
lighter
in
course
of
time
as
bachofen
remarks
the
annually
repeated
surrender
gives
place
to
a
single
sacrifice
the
hetaerism
of
the
matrons
is
followed
by
that
of
the
maidens
the
promiscuous
intercourse
during
marriage
to
that
before
wedding
the
indiscriminate
intercourse
with
all
to
that
with
certain
individuals
among
some
nations
the
religious
disguise
is
missing
among
others
thracians
celts
in
classic
times
many
primitive
inhabitants
of
india
malay
nations
south
sea
islanders
and
many
american
indians
to
this
day
the
girls
enjoy
absolute
sexual
freedom
before
marriage
this
is
especially
true
almost
everywhere
in
south
america
as
everybody
can
confirm
who
penetrates
a
little
into
the
interior
agassiz
relates
an
anecdote
of
a
wealthy
family
of
indian
descent
on
being
introduced
to
the
daughter
he
asked
something
about
her
father
presuming
him
to
be
her
mother
husband
who
was
in
the
war
against
paraguay
but
the
mother
replied
smiling
nao
tem

filha
da

she
has
any
father
she
is
the
daughter
of
chance
it
is
the
way
the
indian
or
women
here
always
speak
of
their
illegitimate
children
and
though
they
say
it
without
an
intonation
of
sadness
or
of
blame
apparently
as
unconscious
of
any
wrong
or
shame
as
if
they
said
the
father
was
absent
or
dead
it
has
the
most
melancholy
significance
it
seems
to
speak
of
such
absolute
desertion
so
far
is
this
from
being
an
unusual
case
that
among
the
common
people
the
opposite
seems
the
exception
children
are
frequently
quite
ignorant
of
their
parentage
they
know
about
their
mother
for
all
the
care
and
responsibility
falls
upon
her
but
they
have
no
knowledge
of
their
father
nor
does
it
seem
to
occur
to
the
woman
that
she
or
her
children
have
any
claim
upon
him
what
seems
so
strange
to
the
civilized
man
is
simply
the
rule
of
maternal
law
and
group
marriage
again
among
other
nations
the
friends
and
relatives
of
the
bridegroom
or
the
wedding
guests
claim
their
traditional
right
to
the
bride
and
the
bridegroom
comes
last
this
custom
prevailed
in
ancient
times
on
the
baleares
and
among
the
african
augilers
it
is
observed
to
this
day
by
the
bareas
in

in
still
other

the

of
a

the

all
modern

whitewashing
notwithstanding
this
jus

still
in
force
among
most
of
the
natives
of
alaska
among
the
tahus
of
northern
mexico
and
some
other
nations
and
during
the
whole
of
the
middle
ages
it
was
practiced
at
least
in
originally
celtic
countries
where
it
was
directly
transmitted
by
group
marriage
in
aragonia
while
in
castilia
the
peasant
was
never
a
serf
the
most
disgraceful
serfdom
existed
in
aragonia
until
abolished
by
the
decision
of
ferdinand
the
catholic

and

that

furthermore
is
perfectly
right
in
contending
that
the
transition
from
what
he
calls
hetaerism
or
incestuous
generation
to
monogamy
was
brought
about
mainly
by
women
the
more
in
the
course
of
economic
development
undermining
the
old
communism
and
increasing
the
density
of
population
the
traditional
sexual
relations
lost
their
innocent
character
suited
to
the
primitive
forest
the
more
debasing
and
oppressive
they
naturally
appeared
to
women
and
the
more
they
consequently
longed
for
relief
by
the
right
of
chastity
of
temporary
or
permanent
marriage
with
one
man
this
progress
could
not
be
due
to
men
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
never
even
to
this
day
had
the
least
intention
of
renouncing
the
pleasures
of
actual
group
marriage
not
until
the
women
had
accomplished
the
transition
to
the
pairing
family
could
the
men
introduce
strict
monogamy
true
only
for
women
the
pairing
family
arose
on
the
boundary
line
between
savagery
and
barbarism
generally
in
the
higher
stage
of
savagery
here
and
there
in
the
lower
stage
of
barbarism
it
is
the
form
of
the
family
characteristic
for
barbarism
as
group
marriage
is
for
savagery
and
monogamy
for
civilization
in
order
to
develop
it
into
established
monogamy
other
causes
than
those
active
hitherto
were
required
in
the
pairing
family
the
group
was
already
reduced
to
its
last
unit
its
biatomic
molecule
one
man
and
one
woman
natural
selection
had
accomplished
its
purpose
by
a
continually
increasing
restriction
of
sexual
intercourse
nothing
remained
to
be
done
in
this
direction
unless
new
social
forces
became
active
there
was
no
reason
why
a
new
form
of
the
family
should
develop
out
of
the
pairing
family
but
these
forces
did
become
active
we
now
leave
america
the
classic
soil
of
the
pairing
family
no
sign
permits
the
conclusion
that
a
higher
form
of
the
family
was
developed
here
that
any
established
form
of
monogamy
ever
existed
anywhere
in
the
new
world
before
the
discovery
and
conquest
not
so
in
the
old
world
in
the
latter
the
domestication
of
animals
and
the
breeding
of
flocks
had
developed
a
hitherto
unknown
source
of
wealth
and
created
entirely
new
social
conditions
up
to
the
lower
stage
of
barbarism
fixed
wealth
was
almost
exclusively
represented
by
houses
clothing
rough
ornaments
and
the
tools
for
obtaining
and
preparing
food
boats
weapons
and
household
articles
of
the
simplest
kind
nourishment
had
to
be
secured
afresh
day
by
day
but
now
with
their
herds
of
horses
camels
donkeys
cattle
sheep
goats
and
hogs
the
advancing
nomadic
nations
the
aryans
in
the
indian
punjab
in
the
region
of
the
ganges
and
the
steppes
of
the
oxus
and
jaxartes
then
still
more
rich
in
than
now
the
semites
on
the
euphrates
and
tigris
had
acquired
possessions
demanding
only
the
most
crude
attention
and
care
in
order
to
propagate
themselves
in
ever
increasing
numbers
and
yield
the
most
abundant
store
of
milk
and
meat
all
former
means
of
obtaining
food
were
now
forced
to
the
background
hunting
once
a
necessity
now
became
a
sport
but
who
was
the
owner
of
this
new
wealth
doubtless
it
was
originally
the
gens
however
private
ownership
of
flocks
must
have
had
an
early
beginning
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
to
the
author
of
the
first
book
of
moses
father
abraham
appeared
as
the
owner
of
his
flocks
by
virtue
of
his
privilege
as
head
of
a
communistic
family
or
of
his
capacity
as
gentile
chief
by
actual
descent
so
much
is
certain
we
must
not
regard
him
as
a
proprietor
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
word
it
is
furthermore
certain
that
everywhere
on
the
threshold
of
documentary
history
we
find
the
flocks
in
the
separate
possession
of
chiefs
of
families
exactly
like
the
productions
of
barbarian
art
such
as
metal
ware
articles
of
luxury
and
finally
the
human
cattle
the
slaves
for
now
slavery
was
also
invented
to
the
barbarian
of
the
lower
stage
a
slave
was
of
no
use
the
american
indians
therefore
treated
their
vanquished
enemies
in
quite
a
different
way
from
nations
of
a
higher
stage
the
men
were
tortured
or
adopted
as
brothers
into
the
tribe
of
the
victors
the
women
were
married
or
likewise
adopted
with
their
surviving
children
the
human
labor
power
at
this
stage
does
not
yet
produce
a
considerable
amount
over
and
above
its
cost
of
subsistence
but
the
introduction
of
cattle
raising
metal
industry
weaving
and
finally
agriculture
wrought
a
change
just
as
the
once
easily
obtainable
wives
now
had
an
exchange
value
and
were
bought
so
labor
power
was
now
procured
especially
since
the
flocks
had
definitely
become
private
property
the
family
did
not
increase
as
rapidly
as
the
cattle
more
people
were
needed
for
superintending
for
this
purpose
the
captured
enemy
was
available
and
besides
he
could
be
increased
by
breeding
like
the
cattle
such
riches
once
they
had
become
the
private
property
of
certain
families
and
augmented
rapidly
gave
a
powerful
impulse
to
society
founded
on
the
pairing
family
and
the
maternal
gens
the
pairing
family
had
introduced
a
new
element
by
the
side
of
the
natural
mother
it
had
placed
the
authentic
natural
father
who
probably
was
better
authenticated
than
many
a
father
of
our
day
according
to
the
division
of
labor
in
those
times
the
task
of
obtaining
food
and
the
tools
necessary
for
this
purpose
fell
to
the
share
of
the
man
hence
he
owned
the
latter
and
kept
them
in
case
of
a
separation
as
the
women
did
the
household
goods
according
to
the
social
custom
of
that
time
the
man
was
also
the
owner
of
the
new
source
of
existence
the
cattle
and
later
on
of
the
new
labor
power
the
slaves
but
according
to
the
same
custom
his
children
could
not
inherit
his
property
for
the
following
reasons
by
maternal
law
while
descent
was
traced
only
along
the
female
line
and
by
the
original
custom
of
inheriting
in
the
gens
the
gentile
relatives
inherited
the
property
of
their
deceased
gentile
relative
the
wealth
had
to
remain
in
the
gens
in
view
of
the
insignificance
of
the
objects
the
property
may
have
gone
in
practice
to
the
closest
gentile
relatives
the
consanguine
relatives
on
the
mother
side
the
children
of
the
dead
man
however
did
not
belong
to
his
gens
but
to
that
of
their
mother
they
inherited
first
together
with
the
other
consanguine
relatives
of
the
mother
later
on
perhaps
in
preference
to
the
others
but
they
could
not
inherit
from
their
father
because
they
did
not
belong
to
his
gens
where
his
property
had
to
remain
hence
after
the
death
of
a
cattle
owner
the
cattle
would
fall
to
his
brothers
sisters
and
the
children
of
his
sisters
or
to
the
offspring
of
the
sisters
of
his
mother
his
own
children
were
disinherited
in
the
measure
of
the
increasing
wealth
man
position
in
the
family
became
superior
to
that
of
woman
and
the
desire
arose
to
use
this
fortified
position
for
the
purpose
of
overthrowing
the
traditional
law
of
inheritance
in
favor
of
his
children
but
this
was
not
feasible
as
long
as
maternal
law
was
valid
this
law
had
to
be
abolished
and
it
was
this
was
by
no
means
as
difficult
as
it
appears
to
us
for
this
revolution
one
of
the
most
radical
ever
experienced
by
humanity
did
not
have
to
touch
a
single
living
member
of
the
gens
all
its
members
could
remain
what
they
had
always
been
the
simple
resolution
was
sufficient
that
henceforth
the
offspring
of
the
male
members
should
belong
to
the
gens
while
the
children
of
the
female
members
should
be
excluded
by
transferring
them
to
the
gens
of
their
father
this
abolished
the
tracing
of
descent
by
female
lineage
and
the
maternal
right
of
inheritance
and
instituted
descent
by
male
lineage
and
the
paternal
right
of
inheritance
how
and
when
this
revolution
was
accomplished
by
the
nations
of
the
earth
we
do
not
know
it
belongs
entirely
to
prehistoric
times
that
it
was
accomplished
is
proven
more
than
satisfactorily
by
the
copious
traces
of
maternal
law
collected
especially
by
bachofen
how
easily
it
is
accomplished
we
may
observe
in
a
whole
series
of
indian
tribes
that
recently
passed
through
or
are
still
engaged
in
it
partly
under
the
influence
of
increasing
wealth
and
changed
modes
of
living
transfer
from
forests
to
the
prairie
partly
through
the
moral
pressure
of
civilization
and
missionaries
six
out
of
eight
missouri
tribes
have
male
descent
and
inheritance
while
only
two
retain
female
descent
and
inheritance
the
shawnees
miamis
and
delawares
follow
the
custom
of
placing
their
children
into
the
male
gens
by
giving
them
a
gentile
name
belonging
to
the
father
gens
so
that
they
may
be
entitled
to
inherit
innate
casuistry
of
man
to
change
the
objects
by
changing
their
names
and
to
find
loopholes
for
breaking
tradition
inside
of
tradition
where
a
direct
interest
was
a
sufficient
motive
marx
this
made
confusion
worse
confounded
which
could
be
and
partially
was
remedied
alone
by
paternal
law
this
seems
to
be
the
most
natural
transition
marx
as
to
the
opinion
of
the
comparative
jurists
how
this
transition
took
place
among
the
civilized
nations
of
the
old
world
although
only
in
hypotheses
compare
kovalevsky
tableau
des

et
de
de

famille
et
de

stockholm
the
downfall
of
maternal
law
was
the
historic
defeat
of
the
female
sex
the
men
seized
the
reins
also
in
the
house
the
women
were
stripped
of
their
dignity
enslaved
tools
of
men
lust
and
mere
machines
for
the
generation
of
children
this
degrading
position
of
women
especially
conspicuous
among
the
greeks
of
heroic
and
still
more
of
classic
times
was
gradually
glossed
over
and
disguised
or
even
clad
in
a
milder
form
but
it
is
by
no
means
obliterated
the
first
effect
of
the
established
supremacy
of
men
became
now
visible
in
the
reappearance
of
the
intermediate
form
of
the
patriarchal
family
its
most
significant
feature
is
not
polygamy
of
which
more
anon
but
the
organization
of
a
certain
number
of
free
and
unfree
persons
into
one
family
under
the
paternal
authority
of
the
head
of
the
family
in
the
semitic
form
this
head
of
the
family
lives
in
polygamy
the
unfree
members
have
wife
and
children
and
the
purpose
of
the
whole
organization
is
the
tending
of
herds
in
a
limited
territory
the
essential
points
are
the
assimilation
of
the
unfree
element
and
the
paternal
authority
hence
the
ideal
type
of
this
form
of
the
family
is
the
roman
family
the
word
familia
did
not
originally
signify
the
composite
ideal
of
sentimentality
and
domestic
strife
in
the
present
day
philistine
mind
among
the
romans
it
did
not
even
apply
in
the
beginning
to
the
leading
couple
and
its
children
but
to
the
slaves
alone
famulus
means
domestic
slave
and
familia
is
the
aggregate
number
of
slaves
belonging
to
one
man
at
the
time
of
gajus
the
familia
id
est
patrimonium
paternal
legacy
was
still
bequeathed
by
testament
the
expression
was
invented
by
the
romans
in
order
to
designate
a
new
social
organism
the
head
of
which
had
a
wife
children
and
a
number
of
slaves
under
his
paternal
authority
and
according
to
roman
law
the
right
of
life
and
death
over
all
of
them
the
word
is
therefore
not
older
than
the
ironclad
family
system
of
the
latin
tribes
which
arose
after
the
introduction
of
agriculture
and
of
lawful
slavery
and
after
the
separation
of
the
aryan
itali
from
the
greeks
marx
adds
the
modern
family
contains
the
germ
not
only
of
slavery
servitus
but
also
of
serfdom
because
it
has
from
the
start
a
relation
to
agricultural
service
it
comprises
in
miniature
all
those
contrasts
that
later
on
develop
more
broadly
in
society
and
the
state
such
a
form
of
the
family
shows
the
transition
from
the
pairing
family
to
monogamy
in
order
to
secure
the
faithfulness
of
the
wife
and
hence
the
reliability
of
paternal
lineage
the
women
are
delivered
absolutely
into
the
power
of
the
men
in
killing
his
wife
the
husband
simply
exercises
his
right
with
the
patriarchal
family
we
enter
the
domain
of
written
history
a
field
in
which
comparative
law
can
render
considerable
assistance
and
here
it
has
brought
about
considerable
progress
indeed
we
owe
to
maxim
kovalevsky
tableau
etc

the
proof
that
the
patriarchal
household
community
found
to
this
day
among
serbians
and
bulgarians
under
the
names
of
zádruga
friendly
bond
and
bratstvo
fraternity
and
in
a
modified
form
among
oriental
nations
formed
the
stage
of
transition
between
the
maternal
family
derived
from
group
marriage
and
the
monogamous
family
of
the
modern
world
this
seems
at
least
established
for
the
historic
nations
of
the
old
world
for
aryans
and
semites
the
zádruga
of
southern
slavonia
offers
the
best
still
existing
illustration
of
such
a
family
communism
it
comprises
several
generations
of
the
father
descendants
together
with
their
wives
all
living
together
on
the
same
farm
tilling
their
fields
in
common
living
and
clothing
themselves
from
the
same
stock
and
possessing
collectively
the
surplus
of
their
earnings
the
community
is
managed
by
the
master
of
the
house
domácin
who
acts
as
its
representative
may
sell
inferior
objects
has
charge
of
the
treasury
and
is
responsible
for
it
as
well
as
for
a
proper
business
administration
he
is
chosen
by
vote
and
is
not
necessarily
the
oldest
man
the
women
and
their
work
are
directed
by
the
mistress
of
the
house
domácica
who
is
generally
the
wife
of
the
domácin
she
also
has
an
important
and
often
final
voice
in
choosing
a
husband
for
the
girls
but
the
highest
authority
is
vested
in
the
family
council
the
assembly
of
all
grown
companions
male
and
female
the
domácin
is
responsible
to
this
council
it
takes
all
important

sits
in

on

decides
the
question
of

etc
it
is
only
about
ten
years
since
the
existence
of
such
family
communism
in

quite
as
much
as
the
obscina
or
village
community
it
is
found
in
the
oldest
russian
code
the
pravda
of
jaroslav
under
the
same
name
vervj
as
in
the
dalmatian
code
and
may
also
be
traced
in
polish
and
czech
historical
records
likewise
among
germans
the
economic
unit
according
to
heussler
institutions
of
german
law
is
not
originally
the
single
family
but
the
collective
household
comprising
several
generations
or
single
families
and
besides
often
enough
unfree
individuals
the
roman
family
is
also
traced
to
this
type
and
hence
the
absolute
authority
of
the
master
of
the
house
and
the
defenselessness
of
the
other
members
in
regard
to
him
is
strongly
questioned
of
late
similar
communities
are
furthermore
said
to
have
existed
among
the
celts
of
ireland
in
france
they
were
preserved
up
to
the
time
of
the
revolution
in
nivernais
under
the
name
of
parçonneries
and
in
the
franche
comté
they
are
not
quite
extinct
yet
in
the
region
of
louhans
saône
et
loire
we
find
large
farmhouses
with
a
high
central
hall
for
common
use
reaching
up
to
the
roof
and
surrounded
by
sleeping
rooms
accessible
by
the
help
of
stairs
with
six
to
eight
steps
several
generations
of
the
same
family
live
together
in
such
a
house
in
india
the
household
community
with
collective
agriculture
is
already
mentioned
by
nearchus
at
the
time
of
alexander
the
great
and
it
exists
to
this
day
in
the
same
region
in
the
punjab
and
the
whole
northwest
of
the
country
in
the
caucasus
it
was
located
by
kovalevski
himself
in
algeria
it
is
still
found
among
the
kabyles
even
in
america
it
is
said
to
have
existed
it
is
supposed
to
be
identical
with
the
calpullis
described
by
zurita
in
ancient
mexico
in
peru
however
cunow
ausland
no
has
demonstrated
rather
clearly
that
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
a
sort
of
a
constitution
in
marks
called
curiously
enough
marca
with
a
periodical
allotment
of
arable
soil
and
consequently
individual
tillage
was
in
existence
at
any
rate
the
patriarchal
household
community
with
collective
tillage
and
ownership
of
land
now
assumes
an
entirely
different
meaning
than
heretofore
we
can
no
longer
doubt
that
it
played
an
important
role
among
the
civilized
and
some
other
nations
of
the
old
world
in
the
transition
from
the
maternal
to
the
single
family
later
on
we
shall
return
to
kovaleski
further
conclusion
that
it
was
also
the
stage
of
transition
from
which
developed
the
village
or
mark
community
with
individual
tillage
and
first
periodical
then
permanent
allotment
of
arable
and
pasture
lands
in
regard
to
the
family
life
within
these
household
communities
it
must
be
remarked
that
at
least
in
russia
the
master
of
the
house
has
the
reputation
of
strongly
abusing
his
position
against
the
younger
women
of
the
community
especially
his
and
of
transforming
them
into
a
harem
for
himself
russian
popular
songs
are
very
eloquent
on
this
point
before
taking
up
monogamy
which
rapidly
developed
after
the
downfall
of
maternal
law
let
me
say
a
few
words
about
polygamy
and
polyandry
both
forms
of
the
family
can
only
be
exceptions
historical
products
of
luxury
so
to
speak
unless
they
could
be
found
side
by
side
in
the
same
country
which
is
apparently
not
the
case
as
the
men
excluded
from
polygamy
can
not
find
consolation
in
the
women
left
over
by
polyandry
the
number
of
men
and
women
being
hitherto
approximately
equal
without
regard
to
social
institutions
it
becomes
of
itself
impossible
to
confer
on
any
one
of
these
two
forms
the
distinction
of
general
preference
indeed
the
polygamy
of
one
man
was
evidently
the
product
of
slavery
confined
to
certain
exceptional
positions
in
the
semitic
patriarchal
family
only
the
patriarch
himself
or
at
best
a
few
of
his
sons
practice
polygamy
the
others
must
be
satisfied
with
one
wife
this
is
the
case
in
the
whole
orient
polygamy
is
a
privilege
of
the
wealthy
and
distinguished
and
is
mainly
realized
by
purchase
of
female
slaves
the
mass
of
the
people
live
in
monogamy
polyandry
in
india
and
thibet
is
likewise
an
exception
its
surely
not
uninteresting
origin
from
group
marriage
requires
still
closer
investigation
in
its
practice
it
seems
by
the
way
much
more
tolerant
than
the
jealous
harem
establishment
of
the
mohammedans
at
least
among
the
nairs
of
india
three
four
or
more
men
have
indeed
one
woman
in
common
but
every
one
of
them
may
have
a
second
woman
in
common
with
three
or
more
other
men
and
in
the
same
way
a
third
fourth
etc
it
is
strange
that
mclennan
did
not
discover
the
new
class
of
club
marriage
in
these
marital
clubs
in
several
of
which
one
may
be
a
member
and
which
he
himself
describes
this
marriage
club
business
is
however
by
no
means
actual
polyandry
it
is
on
the
contrary
as
already
remarks
a
specialized
form
of
group
marriage
the
men
live
in
polygamy
the
women
in
polyandry
the
monogamous
family
it
develops
from
the
pairing
family
as
we
have
already
shown
during
the
time
of
transition
from
the
middle
to
the
higher
stage
of
barbarism
its
final
victory
is
one
of
the
signs
of
beginning
civilization
it
is
founded
on
male
supremacy
for
the
pronounced
purpose
of
breeding
children
of
indisputable
paternal
lineage
the
latter
is
required
because
these
children
shall
later
on
inherit
the
fortune
of
their
father
the
monogamous
family
is
distinguished
from
the
pairing
family
by
the
far
greater
durability
of
wedlock
which
can
no
longer
be
dissolved
at
the
pleasure
of
either
party
as
a
rule
it
is
only
the
man
who
can
still
dissolve
it
and
cast
off
his
wife
the
privilege
of
conjugal
faithlessness
remains
sanctioned
for
men
at
least
by
custom
the
code
napoleon
concedes
it
directly
to
them
as
long
as
they
do
not
bring
their
concubines
into
the
houses
of
their
wives
this
privilege
is
more
and
more
enjoyed
with
the
increasing
development
of
society
if
the
woman
remembers
the
ancient
sexual
practices
and
attempts
to
revive
them
she
is
punished
more
severely
than
ever
the
whole
severity
of
this
new
form
of
the
family
confronts
us
among
the
greeks
while
as
marx
observes
the
position
of
the
female
gods
in
mythology
shows
an
earlier
period
when
women
still
occupied
a
freer
and
more
respected
plane
we
find
woman
already
degraded
by
the
supremacy
of
man
and
the
competition
of
slaves
during
the
time
of
the
heroes
read
in
the
odysseia
how
telemachos
reproves
and
silences
his
mother
the
captured
young
women
according
to
homer
are
delivered
to
the
sensual
lust
of
the
victors
the
leaders
in
the
order
of
their
rank
select
the
most
beautiful
captives
the
whole
iliad
notoriously
revolves
around
the
quarrel
between
achilles
and
agamemnon
about
such
a
captured
woman
in
mentioning
any
hero
of
importance
the
captured
girl
sharing
his
tent
and
bed
is
never
omitted
these
girls
are
also
taken
into
the
hero
home
country
and
his
house
as
kassandra
by
agamemnon
in
aeschylos
boys
born
by
these
female
slaves
receive
a
small
share
of
the
paternal
heirloom
and
are
regarded
as
free
men
teukros
is
such
an
illegitimate
son
and
may
use
his
father
name
the
wife
is
expected
to
put
up
with
everything
while
herself
remaining
chaste
and
faithful
although
the
greek
woman
of
heroic
times
is
more
highly
respected
than
she
of
the
civilized
period
still
she
is
for
her
husband
only
the
mother
of
his
legal
heirs
his
first
housekeeper
and
the
superintendent
of
the
female
slaves
whom
he
can
and
does
make
his
concubines
at
will
it
is
this
practice
of
slavery
by
the
side
of
monogamy
the
existence
of
young
and
beautiful
female
slaves
belonging
without
any
restriction
to
their
master
which
from
the
very
beginning
gives
to
monogamy
the
specific
character
of
being
monogamy
for
women
only
but
not
for
men
and
this
character
remains
to
this
day
for
the
greeks
of
later
times
we
must
make
a
distinction
between
dorians
and
ionians
the
former
with
sparta
as
their
classic
example
have
in
many
respects
still
more
antiquated
marriage
customs
than
even
homer
illustrates
in
sparta
existed
a
form
of
the
pairing
family
modified
by
the
contemporaneous
ideas
of
the
state
and
still
recalling
group
marriage
in
many
ways
sterile
marriages
were
dissolved
king
anaxandridas
about
before
christ
took
another
wife
besides
his
childless
one
and
kept
two
households
about
the
same
time
king
ariston
added
another
wife
to
two
childless
ones
one
of
which
he
dismissed
furthermore
several
brothers
could
have
one
wife
in
common
a
friend
who
liked
his
friend
wife
better
than
his
own
could
share
her
with
him
and
it
was
not
considered
indecent
to
place
a
wife
at
the
disposal
of
a
sturdy
stallion
as
bismarck
would
have
said
even
though
he
might
not
be
a
citizen
a
certain
passage
in
plutarch
where
a
spartan
matron
refers
a
lover
who
persists
in
making
offers
to
her
to
her
husband
seems
to
indicate
according
to
schoemann
even
a
still
greater
sexual
freedom
also
adultery
faithlessness
of
a
wife
behind
her
husband
back
was
unheard
of
on
the
other
hand
domestic
slavery
in
sparta
at
least
during
the
best
time
was
unknown
and
the
serf
helots
lived
on
separate
country
seats
hence
there
was
less
temptation
for
a
spartan
to
hold
intercourse
with
other
women
as
was
to
be
expected
under
such
circumstances
the
women
of
sparta
occupied
a
more
highly
respected
place
than
those
of
other
greeks
spartan
women
and
the
athenian
hetaerae
were
the
only
greek
women
of
whom
the
ancients
speak
respectfully
and
whose
remarks
they
considered
worthy
of
notice
quite
a
different
condition
among
ionians
whose
representative
is
athens
the
girls
learned
only
to
spin
weave
and
sew
at
the
most
a
little
reading
and
writing
they
were
practically
shut
in
and
had
only
the
company
of
other
women
the
women
room
formed
a
separate
part
of
the
house
on
the
upper
floor
or
in
a
rear
building
where
men
especially
strangers
did
not
easily
enter
and
whither
the
women
retreated
when
male
visitors
came
the
women
did
not
leave
the
house
without
being
accompanied
by
a
female
slave
at
home
they
were
strictly
guarded
aristophanes
speaks
of
molossian
dogs
that
were
kept
to
frighten
off
adulterers
and
at
least
in
the
asiatic
towns
eunuchs
were
kept
for
guarding
women
even
at
herodotus
time
these
eunuchs
were
manufactured
for
the
trade
and
according
to
wachsmuth
not
for
barbarians
alone
by
euripides
woman
is
designated
as
oikurema
a
neuter
signifying
an
object
for
housekeeping
and
beside
the
business
of
breeding
children
she
served
to
the
athenian
for
nothing
but
his
chief
house
maid
the
man
had
his
gymnastic
exercises
his
public
meetings
from
which
the
women
were
excluded
besides
the
man
very
often
had
female
slaves
at
his
disposal
and
during
the
most
flourishing
time
of
athens
an
extensive
prostitution
which
was
at
least
patronized
by
the
state
it
was
precisely
on
the
basis
of
this
prostitution
that
the
unique
type
of
ionic
women
developed
the
hetaerae
they
rose
by
esprit
and
artistic
taste
as
far
above
the
general
level
of
antique
womanhood
as
the
spartan
women
by
their
character
but
that
it
was
necessary
to
become
a
hetaera
before
one
could
be
a
woman
constitutes
the
severest
denunciation
of
the
athenian
family
the
athenian
family
became
in
the
course
of
time
the
model
after
which
not
only
the
rest
of
the
ionians
but
gradually
all
the
greeks
at
home
and
abroad
molded
their
domestic
relations
nevertheless
in
spite
of
all
seclusion
and
watching
the
grecian
ladies
found
sufficient
opportunity
for
deceiving
their
husbands
the
latter
who
would
have
been
ashamed
of
betraying
any
love
for
their
wives
found
recreation
in
all
kinds
of
love
affairs
with
hetaerae
but
the
degradation
of
the
women
was
avenged
in
the
men
and
degraded
them
also
until
they
sank
into
the
abomination
of
they
degraded
their
gods
and
themselves
by
the
myth
of
ganymedes
such
was
the
origin
of
monogamy
as
far
as
we
may
trace
it
in
the
most
civilized
and
most
highly
developed
nation
of
antiquity
it
was
by
no
means
a
fruit
of
individual
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
latter
for
the
marriages
remained
as
conventional
as
ever
monogamy
was
the
first
form
of
the
family
not
founded
on
natural
but
on
economic
conditions
viz
the
victory
of
private
property
over
primitive
and
natural
collectivism
supremacy
of
the
man
in
the
family
and
generation
of
children
that
could
be
his
offspring
alone
and
were
destined
to
be
the
heirs
of
his
wealth
these
were
openly
avowed
by
the
greeks
to
be
the
sole
objects
of
monogamy
for
the
rest
it
was
a
burden
to
them
a
duty
to
the
gods
the
state
and
their
own
ancestors
a
duty
to
be
fulfilled
and
no
more
in
athens
the
law
enforced
not
only
the
marriage
but
also
the
fulfillment
of
a
minimum
of
the
matrimonial
duties
on
the
man
part
monogamy
then
does
by
no
means
enter
history
as
a
reconciliation
of
man
and
wife
and
still
less
as
the
highest
form
of
marriage
on
the
contrary
it
enters
as
the
subjugation
of
one
sex
by
the
other
as
the
proclamation
of
an
antagonism
between
the
sexes
unknown
in
all
preceding
history
in
an
old
unpublished
manuscript
written
by
marx
and
myself
in
i
find
the
following
passage
the
first
division
of
labor
is
that
of
man
and
wife
in
breeding
children
and
i
may
add
the
first
class
antagonism
appearing
in
history
coincides
with
the
development
of
the
antagonism
of
man
and
wife
in
monogamy
and
the
first
class
oppression
with
that
of
the
female
by
the
male
sex
monogamy
was
a
great
historical
progress
but
by
the
side
of
slavery
and
private
property
it
marks
at
the
same
time
that
epoch
which
reaching
down
to
our
days
takes
with
all
progress
also
a
step
backwards
relatively
speaking
and
develops
the
welfare
and
advancement
of
one
by
the
woe
and
submission
of
the
other
it
is
the
cellular
form
of
civilized
society
which
enables
us
to
study
the
nature
of
its
now
fully
developed
contrasts
and
contradictions
the
old
relative
freedom
of
sexual
intercourse
by
no
means
disappeared
with
the
victory
of
the
pairing
or
even
of
the
monogamous
family
the
old
conjugal
system
now
reduced
to
narrower
limits
by
the
gradual
disappearance
of
the
punaluan
groups
still
environed
the
advancing
family
which
it
was
to
follow
to
the
verge
of
civilization
it
finally
disappeared
in
the
new
form
of
hetaerism
which
still
follows
mankind
in
civilization
as
a
dark
shadow
upon
the
family
by
hetaerism
morgan
designates
sexual
intercourse
of
men
with
unmarried
women
outside
of
the
monogamous
family
flourishing
as
is
well
known
during
the
whole
period
of
civilization
in
many
different
forms
and
tending
more
and
more
to
open
prostitution
this
hetaerism
is
directly
derived
from
group
marriage
from
the
sacrificial
surrender
of
women
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
the
right
to
chastity
the
surrender
for
money
was
at
first
a
religious
act
it
took
place
in
the
temple
of
the
goddess
of
love
and
the
money
flowed
originally
into
the
treasury
of
the
temple
the
hierodulae
of
anaitis
in
armenia
of
aphrodite
in
corinth
and
the
religious
dancing
girls
of
india
attached
to
the
temples
the
bajaderes
derived
from
the
portuguese
bailadera
dancing
girl
were
the
first
prostitutes
the
surrender
originally
the
duty
of
every
woman
was
later
on
practiced
by
these
priestesses
alone
in
representation
of
all
others
among
other
nations
hetaerism
is
derived
from
the
sexual
freedom
permitted
to
girls
before
marriage
also
a
survival
of
the
group
marriage
only
transmitted
by
another
route
with
the
rise
of
different
property
relations
in
the
higher
stage
of
barbarism
wage
labor
appears
sporadically
by
the
side
of
slavery
and
at
the
same
time
its
unavoidable
companion
professional
prostitution
of
free
women
by
the
side
of
the
forced
surrender
of
female
slaves
it
is
the
heirloom
bequeathed
by
group
marriage
to
civilization
a
gift
as
ambiguous
as
everything
else
produced
by
ambiguous
schismatic
and
contradictory
civilization
here
monogamy
there
hetaerism
and
its
most
extreme
form
prostitution
hetaerism
is
as
much
a
social
institution
as
all
others
it
continues
the
old
sexual
freedom
for
the
benefit
of
the
men
in
reality
not
only
permitted
but
also
assiduously
practised
by
the
ruling
class
it
is
denounced
only
nominally
still
in
practice
this
denunciation
strikes
by
no
means
the
men
who
indulge
in
it
but
only
the
women
these
are
ostracised
and
cast
out
by
society
in
order
to
proclaim
once
more
the
fundamental
law
of
unconditional
male
supremacy
over
the
female
sex
however
a
second
contradiction
is
thereby
developed
within
monogamy
itself
by
the
side
of
the
husband
who
is
making
his
life
pleasant
by
hetaerism
stands
the
neglected
wife
and
you
can
not
have
one
side
of
the
contradiction
without
the
other
just
as
you
can
not
have
the
whole
apple
after
eating
half
of
it
nevertheless
this
seems
to
have
been
the
idea
of
the
men
until
their
wives
taught
them
a
lesson
monogamy
introduces
two
permanent
social
characters
that
were
formerly
unknown
the
standing
lover
of
the
wife
and
the
cuckold
the
men
had
gained
the
victory
over
the
women
but
the
vanquished
magnanimously
provided
the
coronation
in
addition
to
monogamy
and
hetaerism
adultery
became
an
unavoidable
social
institution
denounced
severely
punished
but
irrepressible
the
certainty
of
paternal
parentage
rested
as
of
old
on
moral
conviction
at
best
and
in
order
to
solve
the
unreconcilable
contradiction
the
code
napoléon
decreed
in
its
article
conçu
pendant
le
mariage
a
pour
père
le
mari
the
child
conceived
during
marriage
has
for
its
father
the
husband
this
is
the
last
result
of
three
thousand
years
of
monogamy
thus
we
have
in
the
monogamous
family
at
least
in
those
cases
that
remain
true
to
historical
development
and
clearly
express
the
conflict
between
man
and
wife
created
by
the
exclusive
supremacy
of
men
a
miniature
picture
of
the
contrasts
and
contradictions
of
society
at
large
split
by
since
the
beginning
of
civilization
society
has
been
unable
to
reconcile
and
overcome
these
antitheses
of
course
i
am
referring
here
only
to
those
cases
of
monogamy
where
matrimonial
life
actually
remains
in
accord
with
the
original
character
of
the
whole
institution
but
where
the
wife
revolts
against
the
rule
of
the
man
nobody
knows
better
than
your
german
philistine
that
not
all
marriages
follow
such
a
course
he
does
not
understand
how
to
maintain
the
control
of
his
own
home
any
better
than
that
of
the
state
and
his
wife
is
therefore
fully
entitled
to
wearing
the
trousers
which
he
does
not
deserve
but
he
thinks
himself
far
superior
to
his
french
companion
in
misery
who
more
frequently
fares
far
worse
the
monogamous
family
by
the
way
did
not
everywhere
and
always
appear
in
the
classic
severe
form
it
had
among
the
greeks
among
the
romans
who
as
future
conquerors
of
the
world
had
a
sharper
although
less
refined
eye
than
the
greeks
the
women
were
freer
and
more
respected
a
roman
believed
that
the
conjugal
faith
of
his
wife
was
sufficiently
safeguarded
by
his
power
over
her
life
and
death
moreover
the
women
could
voluntarily
dissolve
the
marriage
as
well
as
the
men
but
the
highest
progress
in
the
development
of
monogamy
was
doubtless
due
to
the
entrance
of
the
germans
into
history
probably
because
on
account
of
their
poverty
their
monogamy
had
not
yet
fully
outgrown
the
pairing
family
three
facts
mentioned
by
tacitus
favor
this
conclusion
in
the
first
place
although
marriage
was
held
very
sacred
they
are
satisfied
with
one
wife
the
women
are
protected
by
chastity
still
polygamy
was
in
use
among
the
distinguished
and
the
leaders
of
the
tribes
as
was
the
case
in
the
pairing
families
of
the
american
indians
secondly
the
transition
from
maternal
to
paternal
law
could
have
taken
place
only
a
short
while
before
because
the
mother
brother
the
next
male
relative
in
the
gens
by
maternal
law
was
still
considered
almost
a
closer
relative
than
the
natural
father
also
in
accordance
with
the
standpoint
of
the
american
indians
the
latter
furnished
to
marx
according
to
his
own
testimony
the
key
to
the
comprehension
of
german
primeval
history
and
thirdly
the
german
women
were
highly
respected
and
also
influenced
public
affairs
a
fact
directly
opposed
to
monogamic
male
supremacy
in
all
these
things
the
germans
almost
harmonize
with
the
spartans
who
as
we
saw
also
had
not
fully
overcome
the
pairing
family
hence
in
this
respect
an
entirely
new
element
succeeded
to
the
world
supremacy
with
the
germans
the
new
monogamy
now
developing
the
ruins
of
the
roman
world
from
the
mixture
of
nations
endowed
male
rule
with
a
milder
form
and
accorded
to
women
a
position
that
was
at
least
outwardly
far
more
respected
and
free
than
classical
antiquity
ever
knew
not
until
now
was
there
a
possibility
of
developing
from
monogamy
in
it
by
the
side
of
it
or
against
it
as
the
case
might
be
the
highest
ethical
progress
we
owe
to
it
the
modern
individual
sexlove
unknown
to
all
previous
ages
this
progress
doubtless
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
germans
still
lived
in
the
pairing
family
and
inoculated
monogamy
as
far
as
possible
with
the
position
of
women
corresponding
to
the
former
it
was
in
no
way
due
to
the
legendary
and
wonderfully
pure
natural
qualities
of
the
germans
these
qualities
were
limited
to
the
simple
fact
that
the
pairing
family
indeed
does
not
create
the
marked
moral
contrasts
of
monogamy
on
the
contrary
the
germans
especially
those
who
wandered
southeast
among
the
nomadic
nations
of
the
black
sea
had
greatly
degenerated
morally
beside
the
equestrian
tricks
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
steppe
they
had
also
acquired
some
very
unnatural
vices
this
is
expressly
confirmed
of
the
thaifali
by
ammianus
and
of
the
heruli
by
prokop
although
monogamy
was
the
only
one
of
all
known
forms
of
the
family
in
which
modern
sexlove
could
develop
this
does
not
imply
that
it
developed
exclusively
or
even
principally
as
mutual
love
of
man
and
wife
the
very
nature
of
strict
monogamy
under
man
rule
excluded
this
among
all
historically
active
ruling
classes
matrimony
remained
what
it
had
been
since
the
days
of
the
pairing
family
a
conventional
matter
arranged
by
the
parents
and
the
first
historical
form
of
sexlove
as
a
passion
as
an
attribute
of
every
human
being
at
least
of
the
ruling
classes
the
specific
character
of
the
highest
form
of
the
sexual
impulse
this
first
form
the
love
of
the
knights
in
the
middle
ages
was
by
no
means
matrimonial
love
but
quite
the
contrary
in
its
classic
form
among
the
provençals
it
heads
with
full
sails
for
adultery
and
their
poets
extol
the
latter
the
flower
of
provençal
love
poetry
the
albas
describe
in
glowing
colors
how
the
knight
sleeps
with
his
adored
the
wife
of
another
while
the
watchman
outside
calls
him
at
the
first
faint
glow
of
the
morning
alba
and
enables
him
to
escape
unnoticed
the
poems
culminate
in
the
parting
scene
likewise
the
frenchmen
of
the
north
and
also
the
honest
germans
adopted
this
style
of
poetry
and
the
manner
of
knightly
love
corresponding
to
it
old
wolfram
von
eschenbach
has
left
us
three
wonderful
day
songs
treating
this
same
questionable
subject
and
i
like
them
better
than
his
three
heroic
epics
civil
matrimony
in
our
day
is
of
two
kinds
in
catholic
countries
the
parents
provide
a
fitting
spouse
for
their
son
as
of
old
and
the
natural
consequence
is
the
full
development
of
the
contradictions
inherent
to
monogamy
voluptuous
hetaerism
on
the
man
part
voluptuous
adultery
of
the
woman
probably
the
catholic
church
has
abolished
divorce
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
had
come
to
the
conclusion
there
was
as
little
help
for
adultery
as
for
death
in
protestant
countries
again
it
is
the
custom
to
give
the
bourgeois
son
more
or
less
liberty
in
choosing
his
mate
hence
a
certain
degree
of
love
may
be
at
the
bottom
of
such
a
marriage
and
for
the
sake
of
propriety
this
is
always
assumed
quite
in
keeping
with
protestant
hypocrisy
in
this
case
hetaerism
is
carried
on
less
strenuously
and
adultery
on
the
part
of
the
woman
is
not
so
frequent
but
as
human
beings
remain
under
any
form
of
marriage
what
they
were
before
marrying
and
as
the
citizens
of
protestant
countries
are
mostly
philistines
this
protestant
monogamy
on
the
average
of
the
best
cases
confines
itself
to
the
community
of
a
leaden
ennui
labeled
wedded
bliss
the
best
mirror
of
these
two
species
of
marriage
is
the
novel
the
french
novel
for
the
catholic
the
german
novel
for
the
protestant
brand
in
both
of
these
novels
they
get
one
another
in
the
german
novel
the
man
gets
the
girl
in
the
french
novel
the
husband
gets
the
horns
it
does
not
always
go
without
saying
which
of
the
two
deserves
the
most
pity
for
this
reason
the
tediousness
of
the
german
novels
is
abhorred
as
much
by
the
french
bourgeois
as
the
immorality
of
the
french
novels
by
the
german
philistine
of
late
since
berlin
became
cosmopolitan
the
german
novel
begins
to
treat
somewhat
timidly
of
the
hetaerism
and
adultery
that
a
long
time
ago
became
familiar
features
of
that
city
in
both
cases
the
marriage
is
influenced
by
the
class
environment
of
the
participants
and
in
this
respect
it
always
remains
conventional
this
conventionalism
often
enough
results
in
the
most
pronounced
prostitution
sometimes
of
both
parties
more
commonly
of
the
woman
she
is
distinguished
from
a
courtisane
only
in
that
she
does
not
offer
her
body
for
money
by
the
hour
like
a
commodity
but
sells
it
into
slavery
for
once
and
all
fourier
words
hold
good
with
respect
to
all
conventional
marriages
as
in
grammar
two
negatives
make
one
affirmative
so
in
matrimonial
ethics
two
prostitutions
are
considered
as
one
virtue
sexual
love
in
man
relation
to
woman
becomes
and
can
become
the
rule
among
the
oppressed
classes
alone
among
the
proletarians
of
our
day
no
matter
whether
this
relation
is
officially
sanctioned
or
not
here
all
the
fundamental
conditions
of
classic
monogamy
have
been
abolished
here
all
property
is
missing
and
it
was
precisely
for
the
protection
and
inheritance
of
this
that
monogamy
and
man
rule
were
established
hence
all
incentive
to
make
this
rule
felt
is
wanting
here
more
still
the
funds
are
missing
civil
law
protecting
male
rule
applies
only
to
the
possessing
classes
and
their
intercourse
with
proletarians
law
is
expensive
and
therefore
the
poverty
of
the
laborer
makes
it
meaningless
for
his
relation
to
his
wife
entirely
different
personal
and
social
conditions
decide
in
this
case
and
finally
since
the
great
industries
have
removed
women
from
the
home
to
the
labor
market
and
to
the
factory
the
last
remnant
of
man
rule
in
the
proletarian
home
has
lost
its
ground
except
perhaps
a
part
of
the
brutality
against
women
that
has
become
general
since
the
advent
of
monogamy
thus
the
family
of
the
proletarian
is
no
longer
strictly
monogamous
even
with
all
the
most
passionate
love
and
the
most
unalterable
loyalty
of
both
parties
and
in
spite
of
any
possible
clerical
or
secular
sanction
consequently
the
eternal
companions
of
monogamy
hetaerism
and
adultery
play
an
almost
insignificant
role
here
the
woman
has
practically
regained
the
right
of
separation
and
if
a
couple
can
not
agree
they
rather
separate
in
short
the
proletarian
marriage
is
monogamous
in
the
etymological
sense
of
the
word
but
by
no
means
in
a
historical
sense
true
our
jurists
hold
that
the
progress
of
legislation
continually
lessens
all
cause
of
complaint
for
women
the
modern
systems
of
civil
law
recognize
first
that
marriage
in
order
to
be
legal
must
be
a
contract
based
on
voluntary
consent
of
both
parties
and
secondly
that
during
marriage
the
relations
of
both
parties
shall
be
founded
on
equal
rights
and
duties
these
two
demands
logically
enforced
will
so
they
claim
give
to
women
everything
they
could
possibly
ask
this
genuinely
juridical
argumentation
is
exactly
the
same
as
that
used
by
the
radical
republican
bourgeois
to
cut
short
and
dismiss
the
proletarian
the
labor
contract
is
said
to
be
voluntarily
made
by
both
parties
but
it
is
considered
as
voluntary
when
the
law
places
both
parties
on
equal
terms
on
paper
the
power
conferred
on
one
party
by
the
division
of
classes
the
pressure
thereby
exerted
on
the
other
party
the
actual
economic
relation
of
the
two
all
this
does
not
concern
the
law
again
during
the
term
of
the
contract
both
parties
are
held
to
have
equal
rights
unless
one
has
expressly
renounced
his
right
that
the
economic
situation
forces
the
laborer
to
give
up
even
the
last
semblance
of
equality
that
is
not
the
fault
of
the
law
in
regard
to
marriage
even
the
most
advanced
law
is
completely
satisfied
after
both
parties
have
formally
declared
their
willingness
what
passes
behind
the
juridical
scenes
where
the
actual
process
of
living
is
going
on
and
how
this
willingness
is
brought
about
that
can
not
be
the
business
of
the
law
and
the
jurist
yet
the
simplest
legal
comparison
should
show
to
the
jurist
what
this
willingness
really
means
in
those
countries
where
a
legitimate
portion
of
the
parental
wealth
is
assured
to
children
and
where
these
can
not
be
disinherited
in
germany
in
countries
with
french
law
the
children
are
bound
to
secure
the
consent
of
their
parents
for
marrying
in
countries
with
english
law
where
the
consent
of
the
parents
is
by
no
means
a
legal
qualification
of
marriage
the
parents
have
full
liberty
to
bequeath
their
wealth
to
anyone
and
may
disinherit
their
children
at
will
hence
it
is
clear
that
among
classes
having
any
property
to
bequeath
the
freedom
to
marry
is
not
a
particle
greater
in
england
and
america
than
in
france
and
germany
the
legal
equality
of
man
and
woman
in
marriage
is
by
no
means
better
founded
their
legal
inequality
inherited
from
earlier
stages
of
society
is
not
the
cause
but
the
effect
of
the
economic
oppression
of
women
in
the
ancient
communistic
household
comprising
many
married
couples
and
their
children
the
administration
of
the
household
entrusted
to
women
was
just
as
much
a
public
function
a
socially
necessary
industry
as
the
procuring
of
food
by
men
in
the
patriarchal
and
still
more
in
the
monogamous
family
this
was
changed
the
administration
of
the
household
lost
its
public
character
it
was
no
longer
a
concern
of
society
it
became
a
private
service
the
woman
became
the
first
servant
of
the
house
excluded
from
participation
in
social
production
only
by
the
great
industries
of
our
time
the
access
to
social
production
was
again
opened
for
women
for
proletarian
women
alone
however
this
is
done
in
such
a
manner
that
they
remain
excluded
from
public
production
and
can
not
earn
anything
if
they
fulfill
their
duties
in
the
private
service
of
the
family
or
that
they
are
unable
to
attend
to
their
family
duties
if
they
wish
to
participate
in
public
industries
and
earn
a
living
independently
as
in
the
factory
so
women
are
situated
in
all
business
departments
up
to
the
medical
and
legal
professions
the
modern
monogamous
family
is
founded
on
the
open
or
disguised
domestic
slavery
of
women
and
modern
society
is
a
mass
composed
of
molecules
in
the
form
of
monogamous
families
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
the
man
has
to
earn
a
living
and
to
support
his
family
at
least
among
the
possessing
classes
he
thereby
obtains
a
superior
position
that
has
no
need
of
any
legal
special
privilege
in
the
family
he
is
the
bourgeois
the
woman
represents
the
proletariat
in
the
industrial
world
however
the
specific
character
of
the
economic
oppression
weighing
on
the
proletariat
appears
in
its
sharpest
outlines
only
after
all
special
privileges
of
the
capitalist
class
are
abolished
and
the
full
legal
equality
of
both
classes
is
established
a
democratic
republic
does
not
abolish
the
distinction
between
the
two
classes
on
the
contrary
it
offers
the
battleground
on
which
this
distinction
can
be
fought
out
likewise
the
peculiar
character
of
man
rule
over
woman
in
the
modern
family
the
necessity
and
the
manner
of
accomplishing
the
real
social
equality
of
the
two
will
appear
in
broad
daylight
only
then
when
both
of
them
will
enjoy
complete
legal
equality
it
will
then
be
seen
that
the
emancipation
of
women
is
primarily
dependent
on
the
of
the
whole
female
sex
into
the
public
industries
to
accomplish
this
the
monogamous
family
must
cease
to
be
the
industrial
unit
of
society
we
have
then
three
main
forms
of
the
family
corresponding
in
general
to
the
three
main
stages
of
human
development
for
savagery
group
marriage
for
barbarism
the
pairing
family
for
civilization
monogamy
supplemented
by
adultery
and
prostitution
between
the
pairing
family
and
monogamy
in
the
higher
stage
of
barbarism
the
rule
of
men
over
female
slaves
and
polygamy
is
inserted
as
we
proved
by
our
whole
argument
the
progress
visible
in
this
chain
of
phenomena
is
connected
with
the
peculiarity
of
more
and
more
curtailing
the
sexual
freedom
of
the
group
marriage
for
women
but
not
for
men
and
group
marriage
is
actually
practised
by
men
to
this
day
what
is
considered
a
crime
for
women
and
entails
grave
legal
and
social
consequences
for
them
is
considered
honorable
for
men
or
in
the
worst
case
a
slight
moral
blemish
born
with
pleasure
but
the
more
traditional
hetaerism
is
changed
in
our
day
by
capitalistic
production
and
conforms
to
it
the
more
hetaerism
is
transformed
into
undisguised
prostitution
the
more
demoralizing
are
its
effects
and
it
demoralizes
men
far
more
than
women
prostitution
does
not
degrade
the
whole
female
sex
but
only
the
luckless
women
that
become
its
victims
and
even
those
not
to
the
extent
generally
assumed
but
it
degrades
the
character
of
the
entire
male
world
especially
a
long
engagement
is
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
a
perfect
training
school
of
adultery
we
are
now
approaching
a
social
revolution
in
which
the
old
economic
foundations
of
monogamy
will
disappear
just
as
surely
as
those
of
its
complement
prostitution
monogamy
arose
through
the
concentration
of
considerable
wealth
in
one
hand
a
man
hand
and
from
the
endeavor
to
bequeath
this
wealth
to
the
children
of
this
man
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
this
necessitated
monogamy
on
the
woman
but
not
on
the
part
hence
this
monogamy
of
women
in
no
way
hindered
open
or
secret
polygamy
of
men
now
the
impending
social
revolution
will
reduce
this
whole
care
of
inheritance
to
a
minimum
by
changing
at
least
the
overwhelming
part
of
permanent
and
inheritable
wealth
the
means
of
production
into
social
property
since
monogamy
was
caused
by
economic
conditions
will
it
disappear
when
these
causes
are
abolished
one
might
reply
not
without
reason
not
only
will
it
not
disappear
but
it
will
rather
be
perfectly
realized
for
with
the
transformation
of
the
means
of
production
into
collective
property
wage
labor
will
also
disappear
and
with
it
the
proletariat
and
the
necessity
for
a
certain
statistically
ascertainable
number
of
women
to
surrender
for
money
prostitution
disappears
and
monogamy
instead
of
going
out
of
existence
at
last
becomes
a
reality
for
men
also
at
all
events
the
situation
will
be
very
much
changed
for
men
but
also
that
of
women
and
of
all
women
will
be
considerably
altered
with
the
transformation
of
the
means
of
production
into
collective
property
the
monogamous
family
ceases
to
be
the
economic
unit
of
society
the
private
household
changes
to
a
social
industry
the
care
and
education
of
children
becomes
a
public
matter
society
cares
equally
well
for
all
children
legal
or
illegal
this
removes
the
care
about
the
consequences
which
now
forms
the
essential
social
factor
moral
and
economic
hindering
a
girl
to
surrender
unconditionally
to
the
beloved
man
will
not
this
be
sufficient
cause
for
a
gradual
rise
of
a
more
unconventional
intercourse
of
the
sexes
and
a
more
lenient
public
opinion
regarding
virgin
honor
and
female
shame
and
finally
did
we
not
see
that
in
the
modern
world
monogamy
and
prostitution
though
antitheses
are
inseparable
and
poles
of
the
same
social
condition
can
prostitution
disappear
without
engulfing
at
the
same
time
monogamy
here
a
new
element
becomes
active
an
element
which
at
best
existed
only
in
the
germ
at
the
time
when
monogamy
developed
individual
sexlove
before
the
middle
ages
we
can
not
speak
of
individual
sexlove
it
goes
without
saying
that
personal
beauty
intimate
intercourse
harmony
of
inclinations
awakened
a
longing
for
sexual
intercourse
in
persons
of
different
sex
and
that
it
was
not
absolutely
immaterial
to
men
and
women
with
whom
they
entered
into
such
most
intimate
intercourse
but
from
such
a
relation
to
our
sexlove
there
is
a
long
way
yet
all
through
antiquity
marriages
were
arranged
for
the
participants
by
the
parents
and
the
former
quietly
submitted
what
little
matrimonial
love
was
known
to
antiquity
was
not
subjective
inclination
but
objective
duty
not
cause
but
corollary
of
marriage
love
affairs
in
a
modern
sense
occurred
in
classical
times
only
outside
of
official
society
the
shepherds
whose
happiness
and
woe
in
love
is
sung
by
theocritos
and
moschus
such
as
daphnis
and
chloë
of
longos
all
these
were
slaves
who
had
no
share
in
the
state
and
in
the
daily
sphere
of
the
free
citizen
outside
of
slave
circles
we
find
love
affairs
only
as
products
of
disintegration
of
the
sinking
old
world
their
objects
are
women
who
also
are
standing
outside
of
official
society
hetaerae
that
are
either
foreigners
or
liberated
slaves
in
athens
since
the
beginning
of
its
decline
in
rome
at
the
time
of
the
emperors
if
love
affairs
really
occurred
between
free
male
and
female
citizens
it
was
only
in
the
form
of
adultery
and
to
the
classical
love
poet
of
antiquity
the
old
anakreon
sexlove
in
our
sense
was
so
immaterial
that
he
did
not
even
care
a
fig
for
the
sex
of
the
beloved
being
our
sexlove
is
essentially
different
from
the
simple
sexual
craving
the
eros
of
the
ancients
in
the
first
place
it
presupposes
mutual
love
in
this
respect
woman
is
the
equal
of
man
while
in
the
antique
eros
her
permission
is
by
no
means
always
asked
in
the
second
place
our
sexlove
has
such
a
degree
of
intensity
and
duration
that
in
the
eyes
of
both
parties
lack
of
possession
and
separation
appear
as
a
great
if
not
the
greatest
calamity
in
order
to
possess
one
another
they
play
for
high
stakes
even
to
the
point
of
risking
their
lives
a
thing
heard
of
only
in
adultery
during
the
classical
age
and
finally
a
new
moral
standard
is
introduced
for
judging
sexual
intercourse
we
not
only
ask
was
it
legal
or
illegal
but
also
was
it
caused
by
mutual
love
or
not
of
course
this
new
standard
meets
with
no
better
fate
in
feudal
or
bourgeois
practice
than
all
other
moral
standards
it
is
simply
ignored
but
neither
does
it
fare
worse
it
is
recognized
just
as
much
as
the
others
in
theory
on
paper
and
that
is
all
we
can
expect
at
present
where
antiquity
left
off
with
its
attempts
at
sexual
love
there
the
middle
ages
resumed
the
thread
with
adultery
we
have
already
described
the
love
of
the
knights
that
invented
the
day
songs
from
this
love
endeavoring
to
break
through
the
bonds
of
marriage
to
the
love
destined
to
found
marriage
there
is
a
long
distance
which
was
never
fully
traversed
by
the
knights
even
in
passing
on
from
the
frivolous
romanic
race
to
the
virtuous
germans
we
find
in
the
nibelungen
song
kriemhild
who
secretly
is
no
less
in
love
with
siegfried
than
he
with
her
meekly
replying
to
gunther
announcement
that
he
has
pledged
her
in
troth
to
a
certain
knight
whom
he
does
not
name
you
need
not
beg
for
my
consent
as
you
will
demand
so
i
shall
ever
be
whomever
you
sir
will
select
for
my
husband
i
shall
willingly
take
in
troth
it
does
not
enter
her
head
at
all
that
her
love
could
find
any
consideration
gunther
asks
for
brunhild
etzel
for
kriemhild
without
ever
having
seen
one
another
the
same
is
true
of
the
suit
of
gutrun
sigebant
of
ireland
for
the
norwegian
ute
and
of
hetel
of
hegelingen
for
hilda
of
ireland
when
siegfried
of
morland
hartmut
of
oranien
and
herwig
of
sealand
court
gutrun
then
it
happens
for
the
first
time
that
the
lady
voluntarily
decides
favoring
the
last
named
knight
as
a
rule
the
bride
of
the
young
prince
is
selected
by
his
parents
only
when
the
latter
are
no
longer
alive
he
chooses
his
own
bride
with
the
advice
of
the
great
feudal
lords
who
in
all
cases
of
this
kind
have
a
decisive
voice
nor
could
it
be
otherwise
for
the
knight
and
the
baron
as
well
as
for
the
ruler
of
the
realm
himself
marriage
is
a
political
act
an
opportunity
for
increasing
their
power
by
new
federations
the
interest
of
the
house
must
decide
not
the
arbitrary
inclination
of
the
individual
how
could
love
have
a
chance
to
decide
the
question
of
marriage
in
the
last
instance
under
such
conditions
the
same
held
good
for
the
bourgeois
of
the
medieval
towns
the
members
of
the
guilds
precisely
the
privileges
protecting
them
the
clauses
and
restrictions
of
the
guild
charters
the
artificial
lines
of
division
separating
them
legally
here
from
the
other
guilds
there
from
their
journeymen
and
apprentices
drew
a
sufficiently
narrow
circle
for
the
selection
of
a
fitting
bourgeois
spouse
under
such
a
complicated
system
the
question
of
fitness
was
unconditionally
decided
not
by
individual
inclination
but
by
family
interests
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases
the
marriage
contract
thus
remained
to
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
what
it
had
been
from
the
outset
a
matter
that
was
not
decided
by
the
parties
most
interested
in
the
beginning
one
was
already
married
from
his
birth
married
to
a
whole
group
of
the
other
sex
in
the
later
forms
of
group
marriage
a
similar
relation
was
probably
maintained
only
under
a
continual
narrowing
of
the
group
in
the
pairing
family
it
is
the
rule
for
mothers
to
exchange
mutual
pledges
for
the
marriage
of
their
children
here
also
the
main
consideration
is
given
to
new
ties
of
relationship
that
will
strengthen
the
position
of
the
young
couple
in
the
gens
and
the
tribe
and
when
with
the
preponderance
of
private
property
over
collective
property
and
with
the
interest
for
inheritance
paternal
law
and
monogamy
assumed
the
supremacy
then
marriage
became
still
more
dependent
on
economic
considerations
the
form
of
purchase
marriage
disappears
but
the
essence
of
the
transaction
is
more
and
more
intensified
so
that
not
only
the
woman
but
also
the
man
have
a
fixed
price
not
according
to
his
qualities
but
to
his
wealth
that
mutual
fondness
of
the
marrying
parties
should
be
the
one
factor
dominating
all
others
had
always
been
unheard
of
in
the
practice
of
the
ruling
classes
such
a
thing
occurred
at
best
in
romances
or
among
the
oppressed
classes
that
were
not
counted
this
was
the
situation
encountered
by
capitalist
production
when
it
began
to
prepare
since
the
epoch
of
geographical
discoveries
for
the
conquest
of
the
world
by
international
trade
and
manufacture
one
would
think
that
this
mode
of
making
the
marriage
contract
would
have
been
extremely
acceptable
to
capitalism
and
it
was
and
yet
the
irony
of
fate
is
inexplicable
capitalist
production
had
to
make
the
decisive
breach
through
this
mode
by
changing
all
things
into
commodities
it
dissolved
all
inherited
and
traditional
relations
and
replaced
time
hallowed
custom
and
historical
right
by
purchase
and
sale
by
the
free
contract
and
the
english
jurist
maine
thought
he
had
made
a
stupendous
discovery
by
saying
that
our
whole
progress
over
former
epochs
consisted
in
arriving
from
status
to
contract
from
inherited
to
voluntarily
contracted
conditions
so
far
as
this
is
correct
it
had
already
been
mentioned
in
the
communist
manifesto
but
in
order
to
make
contracts
people
must
have
full
freedom
over
their
persons
actions
and
possessions
they
must
furthermore
be
on
terms
of
mutual
equality
the
creation
of
these
free
and
equal
people
was
precisely
one
of
the
main
functions
of
capitalistic
production
what
though
this
was
done
at
first
in
a
way
and
moreover
in
a
religious
disguise
since
the
lutheran
and
calvinist
reformation
the
thesis
was
accepted
that
a
human
being
is
fully
responsible
for
his
actions
only
then
when
these
actions
were
due
to
full
freedom
of
will
and
it
was
held
to
be
a
moral
duty
to
resist
any
compulsion
for
an
immoral
action
how
did
this
agree
with
the
prevailing
practice
of
marriage
according
to
bourgeois
conception
was
a
contract
a
legal
business
affair
and
the
most
important
one
at
that
because
it
decided
the
weal
and
woe
of
body
and
spirit
of
two
beings
for
life
at
that
time
the
agreement
was
formally
voluntary
without
the
consent
of
the
contracting
parties
nothing
could
be
done
but
it
was
only
too
well
known
how
this
consent
was
obtained
and
who
were
really
the
contracting
parties
if
however
perfect
freedom
of
decision
is
demanded
for
all
other
contracts
why
not
for
this
one
did
not
the
two
young
people
who
were
to
be
coupled
together
have
the
right
freely
to
dispose
of
themselves
of
their
bodies
and
the
organs
of
these
had
not
sexual
love
become
the
custom
through
the
knights
and
was
not
in
opposition
to
knightly
adultery
the
love
of
married
couples
its
proper
bourgeois
form
and
if
it
was
the
duty
of
married
couples
to
love
one
another
was
it
not
just
as
much
the
duty
of
lovers
to
marry
each
other
and
nobody
else
stood
not
the
right
of
lovers
higher
than
the
right
of
parents
relatives
and
other
customary
marriage
brokers
and
matrimonial
agents
if
the
right
of
free
personal
investigation
made
its
way
unchecked
into
the
church
and
religion
how
could
it
bear
with
the
insupportable
claims
of
the
older
generation
on
the
body
soul
property
happiness
and
misfortune
of
the
younger
generation
these
questions
had
to
be
raised
at
a
time
when
all
the
old
ties
of
society
were
loosened
and
all
traditional
conceptions
tottering
the
size
of
the
world
had
increased
tenfold
at
a
bound
instead
of
one
quadrant
of
one
hemisphere
the
whole
globe
now
spread
before
the
eyes
of
west
europeans
who
hastened
to
take
possession
of
the
other
seven
quadrants
and
the
barriers
of
conventional
medieval
thought
fell
like
the
old
narrow
obstacles
to
marriage
an
infinitely
wider
horizon
opened
out
before
the
outer
and
inner
eyes
of
humanity
what
mattered
the
propriety
what
the
honorable
privilege
of
the
guild
overcome
through
generations
to
the
young
man
tempted
by
the
gold
and
silver
mines
of
mexico
and
potosi
it
was
the
knight
errant
time
of
the
bourgeoisie
it
had
its
own
romances
and
love
dreams
but
on
a
bourgeois
footing
and
in
the
last
instance
with
bourgeois
aims
thus
it
came
about
that
the
rising
bourgeoisie
more
and
more
recognized
the
freedom
of
contracting
in
marriage
and
carried
it
through
in
the
manner
described
above
especially
in
protestant
countries
where
existing
institutions
were
most
strongly
shaken
marriage
remained
class
marriage
but
within
the
class
a
certain
freedom
of
choice
was
accorded
to
the
contracting
parties
and
on
paper
in
moral
theory
as
in
poetical
description
nothing
was
more
unalterably
established
than
the
idea
that
every
marriage
was
immoral
unless
founded
on
mutual
and
perfectly
free
agreement
of
husband
and
wife
in
short
the
love
match
was
proclaimed
as
a
human
right
not
only
as
droit
de
right
but
also
for
once
as
droit
de
femme
woman
right
however
this
human
right
differed
from
all
other
human
rights
in
one
respect
while
in
practice
other
rights
remained
the
privileges
of
the
ruling
class
the
bourgeoisie
and
were
directly
or
indirectly
curtailed
for
proletarians
the
irony
of
history
once
more
asserted
itself
in
this
case
the
ruling
class
remains
subject
to
economic
influences
and
therefore
shows
marriage
by
free
selection
only
in
exceptional
cases
but
among
the
oppressed
class
love
matches
are
the
rule
as
we
have
seen
hence
the
full
freedom
of
marriage
can
become
general
only
after
all
minor
economic
considerations
that
still
exert
such
a
powerful
influence
on
the
choice
of
a
mate
for
life
have
been
removed
by
the
abolition
of
capitalistic
production
and
of
the
property
relations
created
by
it
then
no
other
motive
will
remain
but
mutual
fondness
since
sexlove
is
exclusive
by
its
very
nature
although
this
exclusiveness
is
at
present
realized
for
women
alone
marriage
founded
on
sexlove
must
be
monogamous
we
have
seen
that
bachofen
was
perfectly
right
in
regarding
the
progress
from
group
marriage
to
monogamy
mainly
as
the
work
of
women
only
the
advance
from
the
pairing
family
to
monogamy
must
be
charged
to
the
account
of
men
this
advance
implied
historically
a
deterioration
in
the
position
of
women
and
a
greater
opportunity
for
men
to
be
faithless
remove
the
economic
considerations
that
now
force
women
to
submit
to
the
customary
disloyalty
of
men
and
you
will
place
women
on
a
equal
footing
with
men
all
present
experiences
prove
that
this
will
tend
much
more
strongly
to
make
men
truly
monogamous
than
to
make
women
polyandrous
however
those
peculiarities
that
were
stamped
upon
the
face
of
monogamy
by
its
rise
through
property
relations
will
decidedly
vanish
namely
the
supremacy
of
men
and
the
indissolubility
of
marriage
the
supremacy
of
man
in
marriage
is
simply
the
consequence
of
his
economic
superiority
and
will
fall
with
the
abolition
of
the
latter
the
indissolubility
of
marriage
is
partly
the
consequence
of
economic
conditions
under
which
monogamy
arose
partly
tradition
from
the
time
where
the
connection
between
this
economic
situation
and
monogamy
not
yet
clearly
understood
was
carried
to
extremes
by
religion
it
has
been
perforated
a
thousand
times
if
marriage
founded
on
love
is
alone
moral
then
it
follows
that
marriage
is
moral
only
as
long
as
love
lasts
the
duration
of
an
attack
of
individual
sexlove
varies
considerably
according
to
individual
disposition
especially
in
men
a
positive
cessation
of
fondness
or
its
replacement
by
a
new
passionate
love
makes
a
separation
a
blessing
for
both
parties
and
for
society
but
humanity
will
be
spared
the
useless
wading
through
the
mire
of
a
divorce
case
what
we
may
anticipate
about
the
adjustment
of
sexual
relations
after
the
impending
downfall
of
capitalist
production
is
mainly
of
a
negative
nature
and
mostly
confined
to
elements
that
will
disappear
but
what
will
be
added
that
will
be
decided
after
a
new
generation
has
come
to
maturity
a
race
of
men
who
never
in
their
lives
have
had
any
occasion
for
buying
with
money
or
other
economic
means
of
power
the
surrender
of
a
woman
a
race
of
women
who
have
never
had
any
occasion
for
surrendering
to
any
man
for
any
other
reason
but
love
or
for
refusing
to
surrender
to
their
lover
from
fear
of
economic
consequences
once
such
people
are
in
the
world
they
will
not
give
a
moment
thought
to
what
we
believe
should
be
their
course
they
will
follow
their
own
practice
and
fashion
their
own
public
opinion
about
the
individual
practice
of
every
person
only
this
and
nothing
more
but
let
us
return
to
morgan
from
whom
we
moved
away
a
considerable
distance
the
historical
investigation
of
social
institutions
developed
during
the
period
of
civilization
exceeds
the
limits
of
his
book
hence
the
vicissitudes
of
monogamy
during
this
epoch
occupy
him
very
briefly
he
also
sees
in
the
further
development
of
the
monogamous
family
a
progress
an
approach
to
perfect
equality
of
the
sexes
without
considering
this
aim
fully
realized
but
he
says
when
the
fact
is
accepted
that
the
family
has
passed
through
four
successive
forms
and
is
now
in
a
fifth
the
question
at
once
arises
whether
this
form
can
be
permanent
in
the
future
the
only
answer
that
can
be
given
is
that
it
must
advance
as
society
advances
and
change
as
society
changes
even
as
it
has
done
in
the
past
it
is
the
creature
of
the
social
system
and
will
reflect
its
culture
as
the
monogamian
family
has
improved
greatly
since
the
commencement
of
civilization
and
very
sensibly
in
modern
times
it
is
at
least
supposable
that
it
is
capable
of
still
farther
improvement
until
the
equality
of
the
sexes
is
attained
should
the
monogamian
family
in
the
distant
future
fail
to
answer
the
requirements
of
society
assuming
the
continuous
progress
of
civilization
it
is
impossible
to
predict
the
nature
of
its
successor

how
little
bachofen
understood
what
he
had
discovered
or
rather
guessed
is
proved
by
the
term
hetaerism
which
he
applies
to
this
primeval
stage
hetaerism
designated
among
the
greeks
an
intercourse
of
men
single
or
living
in
monogamy
with
unmarried
women
it
always
presupposes
the
existence
of
a
well
defined
form
of
marriage
outside
of
which
this
intercourse
takes
place
and
includes
the
possibility
of
prostitution
in
another
sense
this
word
was
never
used
and
i
use
it
in
this
sense
with
morgan
bachofen
very
important
discoveries
are
everywhere
mystified
in
the
extreme
by
his
idea
that
the
historical
relations
of

have
their

in

this

even
in

the
more
ancient

on
which
wagner

this
he
says
proves
that
marriage
between
brother

was
interdicted
even
then
but
the
oegisdrecka
is
the
expression
of
a
time
when
the
belief
in
the
old

was
totally
shaken
it
is
a
truly
lucian
satire
on

if
loki
as

denounces
freya
in
this
manner
then
it
is
rather
a
point

thus
rather
a

that
at
the
time

the

of

was
not

repulsive
at

in
trying

words
while
morgan
and
fison
regard
the
system
of
marriage
classes
as
an
original
organization
preceding
the
punaluan
family
i
have
found
that
the
class
is
indeed
older
than
the
gens
having
its
origin
in
the
different
strata
of
generations
characteristic
of
the
consanguine
family
of
morgan
but
the
present
mode
of
classification
in
force
among
kamilaroi
kabi
yuipera
can
not
have
arisen
until
a
much
later
time
when
the
gentile
institution
had
already
grown
out
of
the
horde
this
system
of
classification
does
not
represent
the
first
timid
steps
of
evolution
it
is
not
the
most
primitive
of
any
known
forms
of
social
organization
but
an
intermediate
form
that
takes
shape
together
with
the
gentile
society
a
stage
of
transition
to
a
pure
gentile
organization
in
this
stage
the
generic
classification
in
strata
of
different
ages
belonging
to
the
consanguine
family
runs
parallel
for
a
while
with
the
gentile
order
it
would
have
been
easy
for
me
to
quote
the
testimony
of
travelers
and
ethnologists
in
support
of
the
conclusions
drawn
by
me
from
the
forms
of
relationship
among
australian
negroes
but
i
purposely
refrain
from
doing
this
with
a
few
exceptions
first
because
i
do
not
wish
to
write
a
general
history
of
the
primitive
family
and
secondly
because
i
consider
all
references
of
this
kind
as
very
doubtful
testimony
unless
they
are
accompanied
by
an
analysis
of
the
entire
organization
we
frequently
find
analogies
to
the
institutions
of
a
lower
stage
in
a
high
stage
and
yet
they
are
founded
on
radically
different
premises
and
causes
the
evolution
of
the
australian
aborigines
shows
that
among
the
australians
of
the
lower
stage
the
hordes
are
endogamous
among
those
of
the
middle
stage
they
are
exogamous
and
in
the
higher
stage
they
are
again
endogamous
but
while
in
the
one
instance
the
marriage
in
the
horde
is
conditioned
on
the
fact
that
the
more
remote
relatives
are
not
yet
excluded
from
sexual
intercourse
it
is
founded
in
the
other
case
on
the
difference
between
local
and
sexual
organization
furthermore
the
marriage
between
daughter
and
father
is
permitted
in
the
lower
stage
and
again
in
that
higher
stage
where
the
class
organization
of
the
kamilaroi
is
on
the
verge
of
dissolution
but
in
both
cases
the
circle
of
those
who
are
regarded
as
fathers
is
entirely
different
the
character
of
an
institution
can
only
be
perfectly
understood
if
we
examine
its
connection
with
the
entire
organization
and
if
possible
trace
its
metamorphoses
in
the
preceding
stages
the
characteristic
feature
of
the
class
system
is
that
by
the
side
of
the
gentile
order
such
as
is
found
among
the
north
american
indians
there
is
always
another
system
of
four
marriage
classes
for
the
purpose
of
limiting
sexual
intercourse
between
certain
groups
of
relatives
neither
the
phratry
nor
the
gens
of
the
kamilaroi
forms
a
distinct
territorial
community
their
members
are
scattered
among
different
roving
hordes
and
they
only
meet
occasionally
to
celebrate
a
feast
or
dance
the
origin
of
gentile
systems
out
of
punaluan
groups
has
never
been
proven
while
we
see
among
the
australian
negroes
that
the
classes
are
clearly
and
irrefutably
in
existence
among
the
first
traces
of
gentilism
the
class
system
in
its
original
form
is
a
conclusive
proof
of
theory
that
the
first
step
in
the
formation
of
systems
of
relationship
consisted
in
prohibiting
sexual
intercourse
between
parents
and
children
in
a
wider
sense
it
has
been
often
disputed
that
the
punaluan
family
ever
existed
outside
of
the
sandwich
islands
but
the
marriage
institutions
of
certain
australian
tribes
named
by
me
prove
the
contrary
the
pirrauru
of
the
dieyerie
is
absolutely
identical
with
the
punalua
of
the
hawaiians
and
these
institutions
were
not
described
by
travelers
who
rushed
through
the
territories
of
those
tribes
without
knowing
their
language
but
by
men
who
lived
among
them
for
decades
and
fully
mastered
their
dialects
i
have
shown
how
far
the
class
system
corresponds
to
the
hawaiian
system
it
is
and
remains
a
fact
that
it
contains
a
long
series
of
terms
that
can
not
be
explained
by
the
relations
in
the
consanguine
family
and
the
use
of
which
creates
confusion
if
applied
to
this
family
but
that
simply
shows
that
morgan
was
mistaken
about
the
age
and
present
structure
of
the
hawaiian
system
it
does
not
prove
that
it
could
not
have
grown
on
the
basis
assumed
by
him
if
the
opponents
of
morgan
dispute
that
the
consanguine
family
is
based
on
blood
kinship
they
are
right
unless
we
wish
to
assign
an
exceptional
position
to
the
australian
strata
of
generations
but
if
they
go
further
and
declare
that
the
subsequent
restrictions
of
inbreeding
and
the
gentile
order
have
arisen
independently
of
relationships
they
commit
a
far
greater
mistake
than
morgan
they
block
their
way
to
an
understanding
of
subsequent
organizations
and
force
themselves
to
all
sorts
of
queer
assumptions
that
at
once
appear
as
the
fruits
of
imagination
when
compared
with
the
actual
institutions
of
primitive
peoples
this
explanation
of
the
phases
of
development
of
family
institutions
contradicts
present
day
views
on
the
matter
since
the
scientific
investigations
of
the
last
decade
have
demonstrated
beyond
doubt
that
the
patriarchal
family
was
preceded
by
the
matriarchal
family
it
has
become
the
custom
to
regard
descent
by
females
as
a
natural
institution
belonging
to
the
very
first
stages
of
development
which
is
explained
by
the
modes
of
existence
and
thought
among
savages
paternity
being
a
matter
of
speculation
maternity
of
actual
observation
it
is
supposed
to
follow
that
descent
by
females
was
always
recognized
but
the
development
of
the
australian
systems
of
relationship
shows
that
this
is
not
true
at
least
not
in
regard
to
australians
the
fact
can
not
be
disputed
away
that
we
find
female
lineage
among
all
those
higher
developed
tribes
that
have
progressed
to
the
formation
of
gentile
organizations
but
male
lineage
among
all
those
that
have
no
gentile
organizations
or
where
these
are
only
in
process
of
formation
not
a
single
tribe
has
been
discovered
so
far
where
female
lineage
was
not
combined
with
gentile
organization
and
i
doubt
that
any
will
ever
be

that
is
at

as
important
as
the
reconstruction
of
the
primeval
form
of
the
family
from
the
systems

it
is
the
proof
that
the
sex
organizations
within
the
tribe
of
north

indians
designated
by
animal
names
are
essentially
identical
with
the
genea
of
the
greeks
and
the
gentes
of
the
romans
that
the
american
form
is
the
original
from
which
the
greek
and

forms
were
later
derived
that
the
whole
organization
of

society
during
primeval
times
in
gens
phratry
and
tribe
finds
its
faithful
parallel
in

of

that
the

is
an

common

all

up

simple
as
the
matter
is
after
we
have
once
found
it
out
still
it
was
only
lately
discovered
by
morgan
in
his
work
of
he
had
not
yet
unearthed
this
mystery
its
revelation
has
completely
silenced
for
the
time
being
those
generally
so
overconfident
english
authorities
on
primeval
history
the
latin
word
gens
used
by
morgan
generally
for
the
designation
of
this
sex
organization
is
derived
like
the
equivalent
greek
word
genos
from
the
common
aryan
root
gan
signifying
to
beget
gens
genos
sanskrit
dschanas

ancient

anglesaxon
kyn
english

middle
high
german
künne
all
signify
lineage
descent
gens
in
latin
genos
in
greek
specially
designate
that
sex
organization
which
boasted
of
common
descent
from
a
common
sire
and
was
united
into
a
separate
community
by
certain
social
and
religious
institutions
but
the
origin
and
nature
of
which
nevertheless
remained
obscure
to
all
our
historians
elsewhere
in
speaking
of
the
punaluan
family
we
saw
how
the
gens
was
constituted
in
its
original
form
it
consisted
of
all
individuals
who
by
means
of
the
punaluan
marriage
and
in
conformity
with
the
conceptions
necessarily
arising
in
it
made
up
the
recognized
offspring
of
a
certain
ancestral
mother
the
founder
of
that
gens
since
fatherhood
is
uncertain
in
this
form
of
the
family
female
lineage
is
alone
valid
and
as
brothers
must
not
marry
their
sisters
but
only
women
of
foreign
descent
the
children
bred
from
these
foreign
women
do
not
belong
to
the
gens
according
to
maternal
law
hence
only
the
offspring
of
the
daughters
of
every
generation
remain
in
the
same
sex
organization
the
descendants
of
the
sons
are
transferred
to
the
gentes
of
the
new
mothers
what
becomes
of
this
group
of
kinship
when
it
constitutes
itself
a
separate
group
distinct
from
similar
groups
in
the
same
tribe
as
the
classical
form
of
this
original
gens
morgan
selects
that
of
the
iroquois
more
especially
that
of
the
seneca
tribe
this
tribe
has
eight
gentes
named
after
animals
wolf
bear
turtle
beaver
deer
snipe
heron
hawk
every
gens
observes
the
following
customs
the
gens
elects
its
sachem
official
head
during
peace
and
its
chief
leader
in
war
the
sachem
must
be
selected
within
the
gens
and
his
office
was
in
a
sense
hereditary
it
had
to
be
filled
immediately
after
a
vacancy
occurred
the
chief
could
be
selected
outside
of
the
gens
and
his
office
could
even
be
temporarily
vacant
the
son
never
followed
his
father
in
the
office
of
sachem
because
the
iroquois
observed
maternal
law
in
consequence
of
which
the
son
belonged
to
another
gens
but
the
brother
or
the
son
of
a
sister
was
often
elected
as
a
successor
men
and
women
both
voted
in
elections
the
election
however
had
to
be
confirmed
by
the
other
seven
gentes
and
then
only
the
was
solemnly
invested
by
the
common
council
of
the
whole
iroquois
federation
the
significance
of
this
will
be
seen
later
the
power
of
the
sachem
within
the
tribe
was
of
a
paternal
purely
moral
nature
he
had
no
means
of
coercion
at
his
command
he
was
besides
by
virtue
of
his
office
a
member
of
the
tribal
council
of
the
senecas
and
of
the
federal
council
of
the
whole
iroquois
nation
the
chief
had
the
right
to
command
only
in
times
of
war
the
gens
can
retire
the
sachem
and
the
chief
at
will
this
again
is
done
by
men
and
women
jointly
the
retired
men
are
considered
simple
warriors
and
private
persons
like
all
others
the
tribal
council
by
the
way
can
also
retire
the
sachems
even
against
the
will
of
the
tribe
no
member
is
permitted
to
marry
within
the
gens
this
is
the
fundamental
rule
of
the
gens
the
tie
that
holds
it
together
it
is
the
negative
expression
of
the
very
positive
blood
relationship
by
virtue
of
which
the
individuals
belonging
to
it
become
a
gens
by
the
discovery
of
this
simple
fact
morgan
for
the
first
time
revealed
the
nature
of
the
gens
how
little
the
gens
had
been
understood
before
him
is
proven
by
former
reports
on
savages
and
barbarians
in
which
the
different
organizations
of
which
the
gentile
order
is
composed
are
jumbled
together
without
understanding
and
distinction
as
tribe
clan
thum
etc
sometimes
it
is
stated
that
intermarrying
within
these
organizations
is
forbidden
this
gave
rise
to
the
hopeless
confusion
in
which
mclennan
could
pose
as
napoleon
and
establish
order
by
the
decree
all
tribes
are
divided
into
those
that
forbid
intermarrying
exogamous
and
those
that
permit
it
endogamous
and
after
he
had
thus
made
confusion
worse
confounded
he
could
indulge
in
deep
meditations
which
of
his
two
preposterous
classes
was
the
older
exogamy
or
endogamy
by
the
discovery
of
the
gens
founded
on
affinity
of
blood
and
the
resulting
impossibility
of
its
members
to
intermarry
this
nonsense
found
a
natural
end
it
is
self
understood
that
the
marriage
interdict
within
the
gens
was
strictly
observed
at
the
stage
in
which
we
find
the
iroquois
the
property
of
deceased
members
fell
to
the
share
of
the
other
gentiles
it
had
to
remain
in
the
gens
in
view
of
the
insignificance
of
the
objects
an
iroquois
could
leave
behind
the
nearest
gentile
relations
divided
the
heritage
was
the
deceased
a
man
then
his
natural
brothers
sisters
and
the
brothers
of
the
mother
shared
in
his
property
was
it
a
woman
then
her
children
and
natural
sisters
shared
but
not
her
brothers
for
this
reason
husband
and
wife
could
not
inherit
from
one
another
nor
the
children
from
the
father
the
gentile
members
owed
to
each
other
help
protection
and
especially
assistance
in
revenging
injury
inflicted
by
strangers
the
individual
relied
for
his
protection
on
the
gens
and
could
be
assured
of
it
whoever
injured
the
individual
injured
the
whole
gens
from
this
blood
kinship
arose
the
obligation
to
blood
revenge
that
was
unconditionally
recognized
by
the
iroquois
if
a
stranger
killed
a
gentile
member
the
whole
gens
of
the
slain
man
was
pledged
to
revenge
his
death
first
mediation
was
tried
the
gens
of
the
slayer
deliberated
and
offered
to
the
gentile
council
of
the
slain
propositions
for
atonement
consisting
generally
in
expressions
of
regret
and
presents
of
considerable
value
if
these
were
accepted
the
matter
was
settled
in
the
opposite
case
the
injured
gens
appointed
one
or
more
avengers
who
were
obliged
to
pursue
the
slayer
and
to
kill
him
if
they
succeeded
the
gens
of
the
slayer
had
no
right
to
complain
the
account
was
squared
the
gens
had
certain
distinct
names
or
series
of
names
which
no
other
gens
in
the
whole
tribe
could
use
so
that
the
name
of
the
individual
indicated
to
what
gens
he
belonged
a
gentile
name
at
the
same
time
bestowed
gentile
rights
the
gens
may
adopt
strangers
who
thereby
are
adopted
into
the
whole
tribe
the
prisoners
of
war
who
were
not
killed
became
by
adoption
into
a
gens
tribal
members
of
the
senecas
and
thus
received
full
gentile
and
tribal
rights
the
adoption
took
place
on
the
motion
of
some
gentile
members
of
men
who
accepted
the
stranger
as
a
brother
or
sister
of
women
who
accepted
him
as
a
child
the
solemn
introduction
into
the
gens
was
necessary
to
confirm
the
adoption
frequently
certain
gentes
that
had
shrunk
exceptionally
were
thus
strengthened
by
mass
adoptions
from
another
gens
with
the
consent
of
the
latter
among
the
iroquois
the
solemn
introduction
into
the
gens
took
place
in
a
public
meeting
of
the
tribal
council
whereby
it
actually
became
a
religious
ceremony
the
existence
of
special
religious
celebrations
among
indian
gentes
can
hardly
be
demonstrated
but
the
religious
rites
of
the
indians
are
more
or
less
connected
with
the
gens
at
the
six
annual
religious
festivals
of
the
iroquois
the
sachems
and
chiefs
of
the
different
gentes
were
added
to
the
keepers
of
the
faith
and
had
the
functions
of
priests
the
gens
had
a
common
burial
place
among
the
iroquois
of
the
state
of
new
york
who
are
crowded
by
white
men
all
around
them
the
burial
place
has
disappeared
but
it
existed
formerly
among
other
indians
it
is
still
in
existence
among
the
tuscaroras
near
relatives
of
the
iroquois
where
every
gens
has
a
row
by
itself
in
the
burial
place
although
they
are
christians
the
mother
is
buried
in
the
same
row
as
her
children
but
not
the
father
and
among
the
iroquois
the
whole
gens
of
the
deceased
attends
the
funeral
prepares
the
grave
and
provides
the
addresses
etc
the
gens
had
a
council
the
democratic
assembly
of
all
male
and
female
gentiles
of
adult
age
all
with
equal
suffrage
this
council
elected
and
deposed
its
sachems
and
chiefs
likewise
the
other
keepers
of
the
faith
it
deliberated
on
gifts
of
atonement
or
blood
revenge
for
murdered
gentiles
and
it
adopted
strangers
into
the
gens
in
short
it
was
the
sovereign
power
in
the
gens
the
following
are
the
rights
and
privileges
of
the
typical
indian
gens
according
to
morgan
all
the
members
of
an
iroquois
gens
were
personally
free
and
they
were
bound
to
defend
each
other
freedom
they
were
equal
in
privileges
and
in
personal
rights
the
sachems
and
chiefs
claiming
no
superiority
and
they
were
a
brotherhood
bound
together
by
ties
of
kin
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
though
never
formulated
were
cardinal
principles
of
the
gens
these
facts
are
material
because
the
gens
was
the
unit
of
a
social
and
governmental
system
the
foundation
upon
which
indian
society
was
organized
a
structure
composed
of
such
units
would
of
necessity
bear
the
impress
of
their
character
for
as
the
unit
so
the
compound
it
serves
to
explain
that
sense
of
independence
and
personal
dignity
universally
an
attribute
of
indian
character
at
the
time
of
the
discovery
the
indians
of
entire
north
america
were
organized
in
gentes
by
maternal
law
only
in
some
tribes
as
among
the
dakotas
the
gentes
had
fallen
out
in
others
as
among
the
ojibwas
the
omahas
and
the
mayas
of
yucatan
descent
had
been
changed
from
the
female
to
the
male
line
among
many
indian
tribes
with
more
than
five
or
six
gentes
we
find
three
four
or
more
gentes
united
into
a
separate
group
called
phratry
by
morgan
in
accurate
translation
of
the
indian
name
by
its
greek
equivalent
thus
the
senecas
have
two
phratries
the
first
comprising
gentes
one
to
four
the
second
gentes
five
to
eight
closer
investigation
shows
that
these
phratries
generally
represent
the
original
gentes
that
formed
the
tribe
in
the
beginning
for
the
marriage
interdict
necessitated
the
existence
of
at
least
two
gentes
in
a
tribe
in
order
to
realize
its
separate
existence
as
the
tribe
increased
every
gens
segmented
into
two
or
more
new
gentes
while
the
original
gens
comprising
all
the
daughter
gentes
lived
on
in
the
phratry
among
the
senecas
and
most
of
the
other
indians
the
gentes
in
the
same
phratry
are
brother
gentes
to
each
other
and
cousin
gentes
to
those
of
the
other
phratry
terms
that
have
a
very
real
and
expressive
meaning
in
the
american
system
of
kinship
as
we
have
seen
originally
no
seneca
was
allowed
to
marry
within
his
phratry
but
this
custom
has
long
become
obsolete
and
is
now
confined
to
the
gens
according
to
the
tradition
among
the
senecas
the
bear
and
the
deer
were
the
two
original
gentes
from
which
the
others
were
formed
by
segmentation
after
this
new
institution
had
become
well
established
it
was
modified
according
to
circumstances
if
certain
gentes
became
extinct
it
sometimes
happened
that
by
mutual
consent
the
members
of
one
gens
were
transferred
in
a
body
from
other
phratries
hence
we
find
the
gentes
of
the
same
name
differently
grouped
in
the
phratries
of
the
different
tribes
the
phratry
among
the
iroquois
was
partly
for
social
and
partly
for
religious
objects
in
the
ball
game
one
phratry
plays
against
another
each
one
sends
its
best
players
the
other
members
upon
different
sides
of
the
field
watch
the
game
and
bet
against
one
another
on
the
result
in
the
tribal
council
the
sachems
and
chiefs
of
each
phratry
are
seated
opposite
one
another
every
speaker
addressing
the
representatives
of
each
phratry
as
separate
bodies
when
a
murder
had
been
committed
in
the
tribe
the
slayer
and
the
slain
belonging
to
different
phratries
the
injured
gens
often
appealed
to
its
brother
gentes
these
held
a
phratry
council
which
in
a
body
addressed
itself
to
the
other
phratry
in
order
to
prevail
on
the
latter
to
assemble
in
council
and
effect
a
condonation
of
the
matter
in
this
case
the
phratry
in
its
original
gentile
capacity
and
with
a
better
prospect
of
success
than
the
weaker
gens
its
daughter
at
the
funeral
of
prominent
persons
the
opposite
phratry
prepared
the
interment
and
the
burial
rites
while
the
phratry
of
the
deceased
attended
the
funeral
as
mourners
if
a
sachem
died
the
opposite
phratry
notified
the
central
council
of
the
iroquois
that
the
office
of
the
deceased
had
become
vacant
in
electing
a
sachem
the
phratry
council
also
came
into
action
endorsement
by
the
brother
gentes
was
generally
considered
a
matter
of
fact
but
the
gentes
of
the
other
phratry
might
oppose
in
such
a
case
the
council
of
this
phratry
met
and
if
it
maintained
its
opposition
the
election
was
null
and
void
formerly
the
iroquois
had
special
religious
mysteries
called
medicine
lodges
by
the
white
men
these
mysteries
were
celebrated
among
the
senecas
by
two
religious
societies
that
had
a
special
form
of
initiation
for
new
members
each
phratry
was
represented
by
one
of
these
societies
if
as
is
almost
certain
the
four
lineages
occupying
the
four
quarters
of
tlascalá
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
were
four
phratries
then
it
is
proved
that
the
phratries
were
at
the
same
time
military
units
as
were
the
greek
phratries
and
similar
sex
organizations
of
the
germans
each
of
these
four
lineages
went
into
battle
as
a
separate
group
with
its
special
uniform
and
flag
and
its
own
leader
just
as
several
genres
form
a
phratry
so
in
the
classical
form
several
phratries
form
a
tribe
in
some
cases
the
middle
group
the
phratry
is
missing
in
strongly
decimated
tribes
what
constitutes
an
indian
tribe
in
america
a
distinct
territory
and
a
distinct
name
every
tribe
had
a
considerable
hunting
and
fishing
ground
beside
the
place
of
its
actual
settlement
beyond
this
territory
there
was
a
wide
neutral
strip
of
land
reaching
over
to
the
boundaries
of
the
next
tribe
a
smaller
strip
between
tribes
of
related
languages
a
larger
between
tribes
of
foreign
languages
this
corresponds
to
the
boundary

and
the

branibor
between

and

giving
the
province
of

its

the

thus
surrounded
by
neutral
ground
was
the
collective
property
of
a
certain
tribe
recognized
as
such
by
other
tribes
and
defended
against
the
invasion
of
others
the
disadvantage
of
undefined
boundaries
became
of
practical
importance
only
after
the
population
had
increased
considerably
the
tribal
names
generally
seem
to
be
more
the
result
of
chance
than
of
intentional
selection
in
course
of
time
it
frequently
happened
that
a
tribe
designated
a
neighboring
tribe
by
another
name
than
that
chosen
by
itself
in
this
manner
the
germans
received
their
first
historical
name
from
the
celts
a
distinct
dialect
peculiar
to
this
tribe
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
tribe
and
the
dialect
are
in
america
the
formation
of
new
tribes
and
dialects
by
segmentation
was
in
progress
until
quite
recently
and
doubtless
it
is
still
going
on
where
two
weak
tribes
amalgamated
into
one
there
it
exceptionally
happened
that
two
closely
related
dialects
were
simultaneously
spoken
in
the
same
tribe
the
average

of
american

is

in
the
united
states
speaking
the
same
dialect
the
right
to
solemnly
invest
the
sachems
and
chiefs
elected
by
the
gentes
and
the
right
to
depose
them
even
against
the
will
of
the
gens
as
these
sachems
and
chiefs
are
members
of
the
tribal
council
these
rights
of
the
tribe
explain
themselves
where
a
league
of
tribes
had
been
formed
and
all
the
tribes
were
represented
in
a
feudal
council
the
latter
exercised
these
rights
the
possession
of
common
religious
conceptions
mythology
and
rites
after
the
fashion
of
barbarians
the
american
indians
were
a
religious
people
their
mythology
has
not
yet
been
critically
investigated
they
materialized
their
religious
conceptions
spirits
of
all
sorts
in
human
shapes
but
the
lower
stage
of
barbarism
in
which
they
lived
knows
nothing
as
yet
of
idols
it
is
a
cult
of
nature
and
of
the
elements
in
process
of
evolution
to
pantheism
the
different
tribes
had
regular
festivals
with
prescribed
forms
of
worship
mainly
dances
and
games
especially
dancing
was
an
essential
part
of
all
religious
celebrations
every
tribe
celebrated
by
itself
a
tribal
council
for
public
affairs
it
was
composed
of
all
the
sachems
and
chiefs
of
the
different
gentes
real
representatives
because
they
could
be
deposed
at
any
moment
it
deliberated
in
public
surrounded
by
the
rest
of
the
tribal
members
who
had
a
right
to
take
part
in
the
discussions
and
claim
attention
the
council
decided
as
a
rule
any
one
present
gained
a
hearing
on
his
demand
the
women
could
also
present
their
views
by
a
speaker
of
their
choice
among
the
iroquois
the
final
resolution
had
to
be
passed
unanimously
as
was
also
the
case
in
some
resolutions
of
german
mark
border
communities
it
was
the
special
duty
of
the
tribal
council
to
regulate
the
relations
with
foreign
tribes
the
council
received
and
despatched
legations
declared
war
and
made
peace
war
was
carried
on
principally
by
volunteers
theoretically
each
tribe
was
at
war
with
every
other
tribe
with
which
it
had
not
formed
a
treaty
of
peace
expeditions
against
such
enemies
were
generally
organized
by
certain
prominent
warriors
they
started
a
war
dance
and
whoever
took
part
in
it
thereby
declared
his
intention
to
join
the
expedition
ranks
were
formed
and
the
march
began
immediately
the
defense
of
the
attacked
tribal
territory
was
also
generally
carried
on
by
volunteers
the
exodus
and
the
return
of
such
columns
was
always
the
occasion
of
public
festivities
the
consent
of
the
tribal
council
for
such
expeditions
was
not
required
and
was
neither
asked
nor
given
this
corresponds
to
the
private
war
expeditions
of
german
followers
described
by
tacitus
only
these
german
groups
of
followers
had
already
assumed
a
more
permanent
character
forming
a
standing
center
organized
during
peace
around
which
the
other
volunteers
gathered
in
case
of
war
such
war
columns
were
rarely
strong
in
numbers
the
most
important
expeditions
of
the
indians
even
for
long
distances
were
undertaken
by
insignificant
forces
if
more
than
one
group
joined
for
a
great
expedition
every
group
obeyed
its
own
leader
the
uniformity
of
the
campaign
plan
was
secured
as
well
as
possible
by
a
council
of
these
leaders
this
is
the
mode
of
warfare
among
the
allemani
in
the
fourth
century
on
the
upper
rhine
as
described
by
ammianus
marcellinus
in
some
tribes
we
find
a
head
chief
whose
power
however
is
limited
he
is
one
of
the
sachems
who
has
to
take
provisional
measures
in
cases
requiring
immediate
action
until
the
council
can
assemble
and
decide
he
represents
a
feeble
but
generally
undeveloped
prototype
of
an
official
with
executive
power
the
latter
as
we
shall
see
developed
in
most
cases
out
of
the
highest
war
chief
the
great
majority
of
american
indians
did
not
go
beyond
the
league
of
tribes
with
a
few
tribes
of
small
membership
separated
by
wide
boundary
tracts
weakened
by
unceasing
warfare
they
occupied
an
immense
territory
leagues
were
now
and
then
formed
by
kindred
tribes
as
the
result
of
momentary
necessity
and
dissolved
again
under
more
favorable
conditions
but
in
certain
districts
tribes
of
the
same
kin
had
again
found
their
way
out
of
disbandment
into
permanent
federations
making
the
first
step
towards
the
formation
of
nations
in
the
united
states
we
find
the
highest
form
of
such
a
league
among
the
iroquois
emigrating
from
their
settlements
west
of
the
mississippi
where
they
probably
formed
a
branch
of
the
great
dakota
family
they
settled
at
last
after
long
wanderings
in
the
present
state
of
new
york
they
had
five
tribes
senecas
cayugas
onondagas
oneidas
and
mohawks
they
lived
on
fish
venison
and
the
products
of
rough
gardening
inhabiting
villages
protected
by
stockades
their
number
never
exceeded
and
certain
gentes
were
common
to
all
five
tribes
they
spoke
closely
related
dialects
of
the
same
language
and
occupied
territories
contiguous
to
one
another
as
this
land
was
won
by
conquest
it
was
natural
for
these
tribes
to
stand
together
against
the
expelled
former
inhabitants
this
led
not
later
than
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
to
a
regular
eternal
league
a
sworn
alliance
that
immediately
assumed
an
aggressive
character
relying
on
its
newly
won
strength
about
at
the
summit
of
its
power
it
had
conquered
large
districts
round
about
and
partly
expelled
the
inhabitants
partly
made
them
tributary
the
iroquois
league
represented
the
most
advanced
social
organization
attained
by
indians
that
had
not
passed
the
lower
stage
of
barbarism
this
excludes
only
the
mexicans
new
mexicans
and
peruvians
the
fundamental
provisions
of
the
league
were
eternal
federation
of
the
five
consanguineous
tribes
on
the
basis
of
perfect
equality
and
independence
in
all
internal
tribal
matters
this
consanguinity
formed
the
true
fundament
of
the
league
three
of
these
tribes
called
father
tribes
were
brothers
to
one
another
the
other
two
also
mutual
brothers
were
called
son
tribes
the
three
oldest
gentes
were
represented
by
living
members
in
all
five
tribes
and
these
members
were
all
regarded
as
brothers
three
other
gentes
were
still
alive
in
three
tribes
and
all
of
their
members
called
one
another
brothers
the
common
language
only
modified
by
variations
of
dialect
was
the
expression
and
proof
of
their
common
descent
the
official
organ
of
the
league
was
a
federal
council
of
fifty
sachems
all
equal
in
rank
and
prominence
this
council
had
the
supreme
decision
in
all
federal
matters
on
founding
this
league
the
fifty
sachems
had
been
assigned
to
the
different
tribes
and
gentes
as
holders
of
new
offices
created
especially
for
federal
purposes
vacancies
were
filled
by
new
elections
in
the
gens
and
the
holders
of
these
offices
could
be
deposed
at
will
but
the
right
of
installation
belonged
to
the
federal
council
these
federal
sachems
were
at
the
same
time
sachems
of
their
tribe
and
had
a
seat
and
a
vote
in
the
tribal
council
all
decisions
of
the
federal
council
had
to
be
unanimous
the
votes
were
cast
by
tribes
so
that
every
tribe
and
the
council
members
of
each
tribe
had
to
vote
together
in
order
to
adopt
a
final
resolution
any
one
of
the
five
tribes
could
convoke
the
federal
council
but
the
council
could
not
convene
itself
federal
meetings
were
held
publicly
in
the
presence
of
the
assembled
people
every
iroquois
could
have
the
word
but
the
final
decision
rested
with
the
council
the
league
had
no
official
head
no
executive
chief
it
had
however
two
high
chiefs
of
war
both
with
equal
functions
and
power
the
two
kings
of
sparta
the
two
consuls
of
rome
this
was
the
whole
constitution
under
which
the
iroquois
lived
over
four
hundred
years
and
still
live
i
have
described
it
more
fully
after
morgan
because
we
have
here
an
opportunity
for
studying
the
organization
of
a
society
that
does
not
yet
know
a
state
the
state
presupposes
a
public
power
of
coërcion
separated
from
the
aggregate
body
of
its
members
maurer
with
correct
intuition
recognized
the
constitution
of
the
german
mark
as
a
purely
social
institution
essentially
different
from
that
of
a
state
though
furnishing
the
fundament
on
which
a
state
constitution
could
be
erected
later
on
hence
in
all
of
his
writings
he
traced
the
gradual
rise
of
the
public
power
of
coërcion
from
and
by
the
side
of
primordial
constitutions
of
marks
villages
farms
and
towns
the
north
american
indians
show
how
an
originally
united
tribe
gradually
spreads
over
an
immense
continent
how
tribes
by
segmentation
become
nations
whole
groups
of
tribes
how
languages
change
so
that
they
not
only
become
unintelligible
to
one
another
but
also
lose
every
trace
of
former
unity
how
at
the
same
time
one
gens
splits
up
into
several
gentes
how
the
old
mother
gentes
are
preserved
in
the
phratries
and
how
the
names
of
these
oldest
gentes
still
remain
the
same
in
widely
distant
and
long
separated
tribes
wolf
and
bear
still
are
gentile
names
in
a
majority
of
all
indian
tribes
and
the
above
named
constitution
is
essentially
applicable
to
all
of
them
except
that
many
did
not
reach
the
point
of
forming
leagues
of
related
tribes
but
once
the
gens
was
given
as
a
social
unit
we
also
see
how
the
whole
constitution
of
gentes
phratries
and
tribes
developed
with
almost
unavoidable
necessity
because
naturally
from
the
gens
all
three
of
them
are
groups
of
differentiated
consanguine
relations
each
is
complete
in
itself
arranges
its
own
local
affairs
and
supplements
the
other
groups
and
the
cycle
of
functions
performed
by
them
includes
the
aggregate
of
the
public
affairs
of
men
in
the
lower
stage
of
barbarism
wherever
we
find
the
gens
as
the
social
unit
of
a
nation
we
are
justified
in
searching
for
a
tribal
organization
similar
to
the
one
described
above
and
whenever
sufficient
material
is
at
hand
as
in
greek
and
roman
history
there
we
shall
not
only
find
such
an
organization
but
we
may
also
be
assured
that
the
comparison
with
the
american
sex
organizations
will
assist
us
in
solving
the
most
perplexing
doubts
and
riddles
in
places
where
the
material
forsakes
us
how
wonderful
this
gentile
constitution
is
in
all
its
natural
simplicity
no
soldiers
gendarmes
and
policemen
no
nobility
kings
regents
prefects
or
judges
no
prisons
no
lawsuits
and
still
affairs
run
smoothly
all
quarrels
and
disputes
are
settled
by
the
entire
community
involved
in
them
either
the
gens
or
the
tribe
or
the
various
gentes
among
themselves
only
in
very
rare
cases
the
blood
revenge
is
threatened
as
an
extreme
measure
our
capital
punishment
is
simply
a
civilized
form
of
it
afflicted
with
all
the
advantages
and
drawbacks
of
civilization
not
a
vestige
of
our
cumbersome
and
intricate
system
of
administration
is
needed
although
there
are
more
public
affairs
to
be
settled
than
nowadays
the
communistic
household
is
shared
by
a
number
of
families
the
land
belongs
to
the
tribe
only
the
gardens
are
temporarily
assigned
to
the
households
the
parties
involved
in
a
question
settle
it
and
in
most
cases
the
traditions
have
settled
everything
beforehand
there
can
not
be
any
poor
and
destitute
the
communistic
households
and
the
gentes
know
their
duties
toward
the
aged
sick
and
disabled
all
are
free
and
equal
the
women
included
there
is
no
room
yet
for
slaves
nor
for
the
subjugation
of
foreign
tribes
when
about
the
iroquois
had
vanquished
the
eries
and
the
neutral
nation
they
offered
to
adopt
them
into
the
league
on
equal
terms
only
when
the
vanquished
declined
this
offer
they
were
driven
out
of
their
territory
what
splendid
men
and
women
were
produced
by
such
a
society
all
the
white
men
who
came
into
contact
with
unspoiled
indians
admired
the
personal
dignity
straightforwardness
strength
of
character
and
bravery
of
these
barbarians
we
lately
received
proofs
of
such
bravery
in
africa
a
few
years
ago
the
zulus
and
some
months
ago
the
nubians
both
of
which
tribes
still
retain
the
gentile
organization
did
what
no
european
army
can
do
armed
only
with
lances
and
spears
without
any
firearms
they
advanced
under
a
hail
of
bullets
from
breechloaders
up
to
the
bayonets
of
the
english
infantry
the
best
of
the
world
for
fighting
in
closed
ranks
and
threw
them
into
confusion
more
than
once
yea
even
forced
them
to
retreat
in
spite
of
the
immense
disparity
of
weapons
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
have
no
military
service
and
do
know
anything
about
drill
how
enduring
and
able
they
are
is
proved
by
the
complaints
of
the
english
who
admit
that
a
kaffir
can
cover
a
longer
distance
in
hours
than
a
horse
the
smallest
muscle
springs
forth
hard
and
tough
like
a
whiplash
says
an
english
painter
such
was
human
society
and
its
members
before
the
division
into
classes
had
taken
place
and
a
comparison
of
that
social
condition
with
the
condition
of
the
overwhelming
majority
of
present
day
society
shows
the
enormous
chasm
that
separates
our
proletarian
and
small
farmer
from
the
free
gentile
of
old
that
is
one
side
of
the
question
we
must
not
overlook
however
that
this
organization
was
doomed
it
did
not
pass
beyond
the
tribe
the
league
of
tribes
marked
the
beginning
of
its
downfall
as
we
shall
see
and
as
the
attempts
of
the
iroquois
at
subjugating
others
showed
whatever
went
beyond
the
tribe
went
outside
of
gentilism
where
no
direct
peace
treaty
existed
there
war
reigned
from
tribe
to
tribe
and
this
war
was
carried
on
with
the
particular
cruelty
that
distinguishes
man
from
other
animals
and
that
was
modified
later
on
simply
by
the
gentile
constitution
in
its
most
flourishing
time
such
as
we
saw
it
in
america
presupposed
a
very
undeveloped
state
of
production
hence
a
population
thinly
scattered
over
a
wide
area
man
was
almost
completely
dominated
by
nature
a
strange
and
incomprehensible
riddle
to
him
his
simple
religious
conceptions
clearly
reflect
this
the
tribe
remained
the
boundary
line
for
man
as
well
in
regard
to
himself
as
to
strangers
outside
the
gens
the
tribe
and
their
institutions
were
holy
and
inviolate
they
were
a
superior
power
instituted
by
nature
and
the
feelings
thoughts
and
actions
of
the
individual
remained
unconditionally
subject
to
them
commanding
as
the
people
of
this
epoch
appear
to
us
nothing
distinguishes
one
from
another
they
are
still
attached
as
marx
has
it
to
the
navel
string
of
the
primordial
community
the
power
of
these
natural
and
spontaneous
communities
had
to
be
broken
and
it
was
but
it
was
done
by
influences
that
from
the
very
beginning
bear
the
mark
of
degradation
of
a
downfall
from
the
simple
moral
grandeur
of
the
old
gentile
society
the
new
system
of
classes
is
inaugurated
by
the
meanest
impulses
vulgar
covetousness
brutal
lust
sordid
avarice
selfish
robbery
of
common
wealth
the
old
gentile
society
without
classes
is
undermined
and
brought
to
fall
by
the
most
contemptible
means
theft
violence
cunning
treason
and
during
all
the
thousands
of
years
of
its
existence
the
new
society
has
never
been
anything
else
but
the
development
of
the
small
minority
at
the
expense
of
the
exploited
and
oppressed
majority
more
than
ever
this
is
true
at
present
chapter
iv
the
grecian
gens
greeks
pelasgians
and
other
nations
of
the
same
tribal
origin
were
constituted
since
prehistoric
times
on
the
same
systematic
plan
as
the
americans
gens
phratry
tribe
league
of
tribes
the
phratry
might
be
missing
as
among
the
dorians
the
league
of
tribes
might
not
be
fully
developed
in
every
case
but
the
gens
was
everywhere
the
unit
at
the
time
of
their
entrance
into
history
the
greeks
were
on
the
threshold
of
civilization
two
full
periods
of
evolution
are
stretching
between
the
greeks
and
the
above
named
american
tribes
the
greeks
of
the
heroic
age
are
by
so
much
ahead
of
the
iroquois
for
this
reason
the
grecian
gens
no
longer
retains
the
archaic
character
of
the
iroquois
gens
the
stamp
of
group
marriage
is
becoming
rather
blurred
maternal
law
had
given
way
to
paternal
lineage
rising
private
property
had
thus
made
its
first
opening
in
the
gentile
constitution
a
second
opening
naturally
followed
the
first
paternal
law
being
now
in
force
the
fortune
of
a
wealthy
heiress
would
have
fallen
to
her
husband
in
the
case
of
her
marriage
that
would
have
meant
the
transfer
of
her
wealth
from
her
own
gens
to
that
of
her
husband
in
order
to
avoid
this
the
fundament
of
gentile
law
was
shattered
in
such
a
case
the
girl
was
not
only
permitted
but
obliged
to
intermarry
within
the
gens
in
order
to
retain
the
wealth
in
the
latter
according
to
grote
history
of
greece
the
gens
of
attica
was
held
together
by
the
following
bonds
common
religious
rites
and
priests
installed
exclusively
in
honor
of
a
certain
divinity
the
alleged
gentile
ancestor
who
was
designated
by
a
special
in
this
capacity
a
common

right

and

in

for

possession
of

at
least
in
some
cases
and
an
archon
supervisor
and
treasurer
elected
for
this
special
case
the
phratry
united
several
gentes
but
rather
loosely
still
we
find
in
it
similar
rights
and
duties
especially
common
religious
rites
and
the
right
of
avenging
the
death
of
a
phrator
again
all
the
phratries
of
a
tribe
had
certain
religious
festivals
in
common
that
recurred
at
regular
intervals
and
were
celebrated
under
the
guidance
of
a
phylobasileus
tribal
head
selected
from
the
ranks
of
the
nobles
eupatrides
so
far
grote
and
marx
adds
the
savage
the
iroquois
is
still
plainly
visible
in
the
grecian
gens
on
further
investigation
we
find
additional
proofs
of
this
for
the
grecian
gens
has
also
the
following
attributes
paternal
lineage
prohibition
of
intermarrying
in
the
gens
except
in
the
case
of
heiresses
this
exception
formulated
as
a
law
clearly
proves
the
validity
of
the
old
rule
this
is
further
substantiated
by
the
universally
accepted
custom
that
a
woman
in
marrying
renounced
the
religious
rites
of
her
gens
and
accepted
those
of
her
husband
gens
she
was
also
registered
in
his
phratry
according
to
this
custom
and
to
a
famous
quotation
in
dikaearchos
marriage
outside
of
the
gens
was
the
rule
becker
in
charikles
directly
assumes
that
nobody
was
permitted
to
intermarry
in
the
gens
the
right
to
adopt
strangers
in
the
gens
it
was
exercised
by
adoption
into
the
family
under
public
formalities
but
it
was
used
sparingly
the
right
to
elect
and
depose
the
archons
we
know
that
every
gens
had
its
archon
as
to
the
heredity
of
the
office
there
is
no
reliable
information
until
the
end
of
barbarism
the
probability
is
always
against
strict
heredity
for
it
is
absolutely
incompatible
with
conditions
where
rich
and
poor
had
perfectly
equal
rights
in
the
gens
not
alone
grote
but
also
niebuhr
mommsen
and
all
other
historians
of
classical
antiquity
were
foiled
by
the
gens
though
they
chronicled
many
of
its
distinguishing
marks
correctly
still
they
always
regarded
it
as
a
group
of
families
and
thus
prevented
their
understanding
the
nature
and
origin
of
gentes
under
the
gentile
constitution
the
family
never
was
a
unit
of
organization
nor
could
it
be
so
because
man
and
wife
necessarily
belonged
to
two
different
gentes
the
gens
was
wholly
comprised
in
the
phratry
the
phratry
in
the
tribe
but
the
family
belonged
half
to
the
gens
of
the
man
and
half
to
that
of
the
woman
nor
does
the
state
recognize
the
family
in
public
law
to
this
day
the
family
has
only
a
place
in
private
law
yet
all
historical
records
take
their
departure
from
the
absurd
supposition
which
was
considered
almost
inviolate
during
the
eighteenth
century
that
the
monogamous
family
an
institution
scarcely
older
than
civilization
is
the
nucleus
around
which
society
and
state
gradually
crystallized
grote
will
also
please
note
throws
in
marx
that
the
gentes
which
the
greeks
traced
to
their
mythologies
are
older
than
the
mythologies
the
latter
together
with
their
gods
and
were
created
by
the
gentes
grote
is
quoted
with
preference
by
morgan
as
a
prominent
and
quite
trustworthy
witness
he
relates
that
every
attic
gens
had
a
name
derived
from
its
alleged
ancestor
that
before
solon
time
and
even
after
it
was
customary
for
the
gentiles
gennêtes
to
inherit
the
fortunes
of
their
intestate
deceased
and
that
in
case
of
murder
first
the
relatives
of
the
victim
had
the
duty
and
the
right
to
prosecute
the
criminal
after
them
the
gentiles
and
finally
the
phrators
whatever
we
may
learn
about
the
oldest
attic
laws
is
founded
on
the
organization
in
gentes
and
phratries
the
descent
of
the
gentes
from
common
ancestors
has
caused
the
schoolbred
philistines
as
marx
has
it
much
worry
representing
this
descent
as
purely
mythical
they
are
at
a
loss
to
explain
how
the
gentes
developed
out
of
independent
and
wholly
unrelated
families
but
this
explanation
must
be
given
if
they
wish
to
explain
the
existence
of
the
gentes
they
then
turn
around
in
a
circle
of
meaningless
gibberish
and
do
not
get
beyond
the
phrase
the
pedigree
is
indeed
a
fable
but
the
gens
is
a
reality
grote
finally
winds
up
the
parenthetical
remarks
are
by
marx
we
rarely
hear
about
this
pedigree
because
it
is
used
in
public
only
on
certain
very
festive
occasions
but
the
less
prominent
gentes
had
their
common
religious
rites
very
peculiar
mr
grote
and
their
common
superhuman
ancestor
and
pedigree
just
like
the
more
prominent
gentes
how
very
peculiar
this
grote
in
less
prominent
gentes
and
the
ground
plan
and
the
ideal
fundament
my
dear
sir
not
ideal
but
carnal
anglice
fleshly
was
the
same
in
all
of
them
marx
sums
up
morgan
reply
to
this
as
follows
the
system
of
consanguinity
corresponding
to
the
archaic
form
of
the
gens
which
the
greeks
once
possessed
like
other
mortals
preserved
the
knowledge
of
the
mutual
relation
of
all
members
of
the
gens
they
learned
this
important
fact
by
practice
from
early
childhood
with
the
advent
of
the
monogamous
family
this
was
gradually
forgotten
the
gentile
name
created
a
pedigree
by
the
side
of
which
that
of
the
monogamous
family
seemed
insignificant
this
name
had
now
the
function
of
preserving
the
memory
of
the
common
descent
of
its
bearers
but
the
pedigree
of
the
gens
went
so
far
back
that
the
gentiles
could
no
longer
actually
ascertain
their
mutual
kinship
except
in
a
limited
number
of
more
recent
common
ancestors
the
name
itself
was
the
proof
of
a
common
descent
and
sufficed
always
except
in
cases
of
adoption
to
actually
dispute
all
kinship
between
gentiles
after
the
manner
of
grote
and
niebuhr
who
thus
transform
the
gens
into
a
purely
hypothetical
and
fictitious
creation
of
the
brain
is
indeed
worthy
of
ideal
scientists
that
is
book
worms
because
the
relation
of
the
generations
especially
on
the
advent
of
monogamy
is
removed
to
the
far
distance
and
the
reality
of
the
past
seems
reflected
in
phantastic
imaginations
therefore
the
brave
old
philistines
concluded
and
conclude
that
the
imaginary
pedigree
created
real
gentes
the
phratry
was
as
among
the
americans
a
comprising
several
daughter
gentes
and
often
traced
them
all
to
the
same
ancestor
according
to
grote
all
contemporaneous
members
of
the
phratry
of
hekataeos
were
descendants
in
the
sixteenth
degree
of
one
and
the
same
divine
ancestor
all
the
gentes
of
this
phratry
were
therefore
literally
brother
gentes
the
phratry
is
mentioned
by
homer
as
a
military
unit
in
that
famous
passage
where
nestor
advises
agamemnon
arrange
the
men
by
phratries
and
tribes
so
that
phratry
may
assist
phratry
and
tribe
the
tribe
the
phratry
has
the
right
and
the
duty
to
prosecute
the
death
of
a
phrator
hence
in
former
times
the
duty
of
blood
revenge
it
has
furthermore
common
religious
rites
and
festivals
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
development
of
the
entire
grecian
mythology
from
the
traditional
old
aryan
cult
of
nature
was
essentially
due
to
the
gentes
and
phratries
and
took
place
within
them
the
phratry
had
an
official
head
phratriarchos
and
also
according
to
de
coulanges
meetings
and
binding
resolutions
a
jurisdiction
and
administration
even
the
state
of
a
later
period
while
ignoring
the
gens
left
certain
public
functions
to
the
phratry
the
tribe
consisted
of
several
kindred
phratries
in
attica
there
were
four
tribes
of
three
phratries
each
the
number
of
gentes
in
each
phratry
was
thirty
such
an
accurate
division
of
groups
reveals
the
fact
of
a
conscious
and
interference
with
the
natural
order
how
when
and
why
this
was
done
is
not
disclosed
by
grecian
history
the
historical
memory
of
the
greeks
themselves
does
not
reach
beyond
the
heroic
age
closely
packed
in
a
comparatively
small
territory
as
the
greeks
were
their
dialectic
differences
were
less
conspicuous
than
those
developed
in
the
wide
american
forests
yet
even
here
we
find
only
tribes
of
the
same
main
dialect
united
in
a
larger
organization
little
attica
had
its
own
dialect
which
later
on
became
the
prevailing
language
in
grecian
prose
in
the
epics
of
homer
we
generally
find
the
greek
tribes
combined
into
small
nations
but
so
that
their
gentes
phratries
and
tribes
retained
their
full
independence
they
already
lived
in
towns
fortified
by
walls
the
population
increased
with
the
growth
of
the
herds
with
agriculture
and
the
beginnings
of
the
handicrafts
at
the
same
time
the
differences
in
wealth
became
more
marked
and
gave
rise
to
an
aristocratic
element
within
the
old
primordial
democracy
the
individual
little
nations
carried
on
an
unceasing
warfare
for
the
possession
of
the
best
land
and
also
for
the
sake
of
looting
slavery
of
the
prisoners
of
war
was
already
well
established
the
constitution
of
these
tribes
and
nations
was
as
follows
a
permanent
authority
was
the
council
bule
originally
composed
of
the
gentile
archons
but
later
on
when
their
number
became
too
great
recruited
by
selection
in
such
a
way
that
the
aristocratic
element
was
developed
and
strengthened
dionysios
openly
speaks
of
the
council
at
the
time
of
the
heroes
as
being
composed
of
nobles
kratistoi
the
council
had
the
final
decision
in
all
important
matters
in
aeschylos
the
council
of
thebes
decides
that
the
body
of
eteokles
be
buried
with
full
honors
the
body
of
polynikes
however
thrown
out
to
be
devoured
by
the
dogs
with
the
rise
of
the
state
this
council
was
transformed
into
the
senate
the
public
meeting
agora
we
saw
how
the
iroquois
men
and
women
attended
the
council
meetings
taking
an
orderly
part
in
the
discussions
and
influencing
them
among
the
homeric
greeks
this
attendance
had
developed
to
a
complete
public
meeting
this
was
also
the
case
with
the
germans
of
the
archaic
period
the
meeting
was
called
by
the
council
every
man
could
demand
the
word
the
final
vote
was
taken
by
hand
raising
aeschylos
in
the
suppliants
or
by
acclamation
the
decision
of
the
meeting
was
supreme
and
final
whenever
a
matter
is
discussed
says
schoemann
in
antiquities
of
greece
which
requires
the
participation
of
the
people
for
its
execution
homer
does
not
indicate
any
means
by
which
the
people
could
be
forced
to
it
against
their
will
it
is
evident
that
at
a
time
when
every
member
of
the
tribe
was
a
warrior
there
existed
as
yet
no
public
power
apart
from
the
people
that
might
have
been
used
against
them
the
primordial
democracy
was
still
in
full
force
and
by
this
standard
the
influence
and
position
of
the
council
and
of
the
basileus
must
be
judged
the
military
chief
basileus
marx
makes
the
following
comment
the
european
scientists
mostly
born
servants
of
princes
represent
the
basileus
as
a
monarch
in
the
modern
sense
the
yankee
republican
morgan
objects
to
this
very
ironically
but
truthfully
he
says
of
the
oily
gladstone
and
his
juventus
mundi
gladstone
who
presents
to
his
readers
the
grecian
chiefs
of
the
heroic
age
as
kings
and
princes
with
the
superadded
qualities
of
gentlemen
is
forced
to
admit
that
on
the
whole
we
seem
to
have
the
custom
or
law
of
primogeniture
sufficiently
but
not
oversharply
defined
as
a
matter
of
fact
gladstone
himself
must
have
perceived
that
a
primogeniture
resting
on
a
clause
of
but
not
oversharp
definition
is
as
bad
as
none
at
all
we
saw
how
the
law
of
heredity
was
applied
to
the
offices
of
sachems
and
chiefs
among
the
iroquois
and
other
indians
all
offices
were
subject
to
the
vote
of
the
gentiles
and
for
this
reason
hereditary
in
the
gens
a
vacancy
was
filled
preferably
by
the
next
gentile
relative
the
brother
or
the
sister
son
unless
good
reasons
existed
for
passing
him
that
in
greece
under
paternal
law
the
office
of
basileus
was
generally
transmitted
to
the
son
or
one
of
the
sons
indicates
only
that
the
probability
of
succession
by
public
election
was
in
favor
of
the
sons
it
implies
by
no
means
a
legal
succession
without
a
vote
of
the
people
we
here
perceive
simply
the
first
rudiments
of
segregated
families
of
aristocrats
among
iroquois
and
greeks
which
led
to
a
hereditary
leadership
or
monarchy
in
greece
hence
the
facts
are
in
favor
of
the
opinion
that
among
greeks
the
basileus
was
either
elected
by
the
people
or
at
last
was
subject
to
the
indorsement
of
their
appointed
organs
the
council
or
agora
as
was
the
case
with
the
roman
king
rex
in
the
iliad
the
ruler
of
men
agamemnon
does
not
appear
as
the
supreme
king
of
the
greeks
but
as
general
in
chief
of
a
federal
army
besieging
a
city
and
when
dissensions
had
broken
out
among
the
greeks
it
is
this
quality
which
odysseus
points
out
in
a
famous
passage
evil
is
the
rule
of
the
many
let
one
be
the
ruler
one
the
chief
to
which
the
popular
verse
about
the
scepter
was
added
later
on
odysseus
does
not
lecture
on
the
form
of
government
but
demands
obedience
to
the
general
in
chief
considering
that
the
greeks
before
troy
appear
only
in
the
character
of
an
army
the
proceedings
of
the
agora
are
sufficiently
democratic
in
referring
to
presents
that
is
the
division
of
the
spoils
achilles
always
leaves
the
division
not
to
agamemnon
or
some
other
basileus
but
to
the
sons
of
the
achaeans
the
people
the
attributes
descendant
of
zeus
bred
by
zeus
do
not
prove
anything
because
every
gens
is
descended
from
some
god
the
gens
of
the
leader
of
the
tribe
from
a
prominent
god
in
this
case
zeus
even
those
who
are
without
personal
freedom
as
the
swineherd
eumaeos
and
others
are
divine
dioi
or
theioi
even
in
the
odyssey
which
belongs
to
a
much
later
period
than
the
iliad
in
the
same
odyssey
the
name
of
heros
is
given
to
the
herald
mulios
as
well
as
to
the
blind
bard
demodokos
in
short
the
word
basileia
with
which
the
greek
writers
designate
the
monarchy
of
homer
because
the
military
leadership
is
its
distinguishing
mark
by
the
side
of
which
the
council
and
the
agorâ
are
existing
means
simply
military
democracy
marx
the
basileus
had
also
sacerdotal
and
judiciary
functions
beside
those
of
a
military
leader
the
judiciary
functions
are
not
clearly
defined
but
the
functions
of
priesthood
are
due
to
his
position
of
chief
representative
of
the
tribe
or
of
the
league
of
tribes
there
is
never
any
mention
of
civil
administrative
functions
but
it
seems
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
council
the
translation
of
basileus
by
king
is
etymologically
quite
correct
because
king
kuning
is
derived
from
kuni
künne
and
signifies
chief
of
a
gens
but
the
modern
meaning
of
the
word
king
in
no
way
designates
the
functions
of
the
grecian
basileus
thucydides
expressly
refers
to
the
old
basileia
as
patrikê
that
is
derived
from
the
gens
and
states
that
it
had
well
defined
functions
and
aristotle
says
that
the
basileia
of
heroic
times
was
a
leadership
of
free
men
and
that
the
basileus
was
a
military
chief
a
judge
and
a
high
priest
hence
the
basileus

in

of
heroic
times
then
we
still
find
the
old
gentilism
fully
alive
but
we
also
perceive
the
beginnings
of
the
elements
that
undermine
it
paternal
law
and
inheritance
of
property
by
the
father

favoring
accumulation
of

in

and
the

gentile
institutions

in

to
justify
the
forcible
robbery
of
wealth
only
one
thing
was
missing
an
institution
that
not
only
secured
the
newly
acquired
property
of
private
individuals
against
the
communistic
traditions
of
the
gens
that
not
only
declared
as
sacred
the
formerly
so
despised
private
property
and
represented
the
protection
of
this
sacred
property
as
the
highest
purpose
of
human
society

that
also
stamped
the
gradually
developing
new
forms
of
acquiring
property
of
constantly
increasing
wealth
with
the
universal
sanction
of
society
an
institution
that
lent
the
character
of
perpetuity

only
to
the
newly
rising
division
into
classes
but
also
to
the
right
of
the
possessing
classes
to
exploit
and
rule
the
classes
and
this
institution
was
found
the

that
their

far
as

corresponded
to

a

of

partly

them
by
new

and
finally
installing
real

how
the
place
of
the
nation
in

defending
itself
through
its
gentes

and
tribes
was
taken
by
an
armed
public
power
of
coërcion
in
the
hands
of
these
authorities
and
available
against
the
mass
of
the
people
nowhere
can
we
observe
the
first
act
of
this
drama
so
well
as
in
ancient
athens
the
essential
stages
of
the
various
transformations
are
outlined
by
morgan
but
the
analysis
of
the
economic
causes
producing
them
is
largely
added
by
myself
in
the
heroic
period
the
four
tribes
of
the
athenians
were
still
installed
in
separate
parts
of
attica
even
the
twelve
phratries
composing
them
seem
to
have
had
separate
seats
in
the
twelve
different
towns
of
cecrops
the
constitution
was
in
harmony
with
the
period
a
public
meeting
agorâ
a
council
bûlê
and
a
basileus
as
far
back
as
we
can
trace
written
history
we
find
the
land
divided
up
and
in
the
possession
of
private
individuals
for
during
the
last
period
of
the
higher
stage
of
barbarism
the
production
of
commodities
and
the
resulting
trade
had
well
advanced
grain
wine
and
oil
were
staple
articles
the
sea
trade
on
the
aegean
sea
drifted
more
and
more
out
of
the
hands
of
the
phoenicians
into
those
of
the
athenians
by
the
purchase
and
sale
of
land
by
continued
division
of
labor
between
agriculture
and
industry
trade
and
navigation
the
members
of
gentes
phratries
and
tribes
very
soon
intermingled
the
districts
of
the
phratry
and
the
tribe
received
inhabitants
who
did
not
belong
to
these
bodies
and
therefore
were
strangers
in
their
own
homes
although
they
were
countrymen
for
during
times
of
peace
every
phratry
and
every
tribe
administered
its
own
affairs
without
consulting
the
council
of
athens
or
the
basileus
but
inhabitants
not
belonging
to
the
phratry
or
the
tribe
could
not
take
part
in
the
administration
of
these
bodies
thus
the
functions
of
the
gentile
organs
became
so
disarranged
that
relief
was
already
needed
during
the
heroic
period
a
constitution
attributed
to
theseus
was
introduced
the
main
feature
of
this
change
was
the
institution
of
central
administration
in
athens
a
part
of
the
affairs
that
had
so
long
been
conducted
autonomously
by
the
tribes
was
declared
collective
business
and
transferred
to
a
general
council
in
athens
this
step
of
the
athenians
went
farther
than
any
ever
taken
by
the
nations
of
america
for
the
simple
federation
of
autonomous
tribes
was
now
replaced
by
the
conglomeration
of
all
tribes
into
one
single
body
the
next
result
was
a
common
athenian
law
standing
above
the
legal
traditions
of
the
tribes
and
gentes
it
bestowed
on
the
citizens
of
athens
certain
privileges
and
legal
protection
even
in
a
territory
that
did
not
belong
to
their
tribe
this
meant
another
blow
to
the
gentile
constitution
for
it
opened
the
way
to
the
admission
of
citizens
who
were
not
members
of
any
attic
tribe
and
stood
entirely
outside
of
the
athenian
gentile
constitution
a
second
institution
attributed
to
theseus
was
the
division
of
the
entire
nation
into
three
classes
regardless
of
the
gentes
phratries
and
tribes
eupatrides
or
nobles
geomoroì
or
farmers
and
demiurgoi
or
tradesmen
the
exclusive
privilege
of
the
nobles
to
fill
the
offices
was
included
in
this
innovation
apart
from
this
privilege
the
new
division
remained
ineffective
as
it
did
not
create
any
legal
distinctions
between
the
classes
but
it
is
important
because
it
shows
us
the
new
social
elements
that
had
developed
in
secret
it
shows
that
the
habitual
holding
of
gentile
offices
by
certain
families
had
already
developed
into
a
practically
uncontested
privilege
that
these
families
already
powerful
through
their
wealth
began
to
combine
outside
of
their
gentes
into
a
privileged
class
and
that
the
just
arising
state
sanctioned
this
assumption
it
shows
furthermore
that
the
division
of
labor
between
farmers
and
tradesmen
had
grown
strong
enough
to
contest
the
supremacy
of
the
old
gentile
and
tribal
division
of
society
and
finally
it
proclaims
the
irreconcilable
opposition
of
gentile
society
to
the
state
the
first
attempt
to
form
a
state
broke
up
the
gentes
by
dividing
their
members
against
one
another
and
opposing
a
privileged
class
to
a
class
of
disowned
belonging
to
two
different
branches
of
production
the
ensuing
political
history
of
athens
up
to
the
time
of
solon
is
only
incompletely
known
the
office
of
basileus
became
obsolete
archons
elected
from
the
ranks
of
the
nobility
occupied
the
leading
position
in
the
state
the
power
of
the
nobility
increased
continually
until
it
became
unbearable
about
the
year
before
christ
the
principal
means
for
stifling
the
liberty
of
the
people
were
money
and
usury
the
main
seat
of
the
nobility
was
in
and
around
athens
there
the
sea
trade
and
now
and
then
a
little
convenient
piracy
enriched
them
and
concentrated
the
money
into
their
hands
from
this
point
the
gradually
arising
money
power
penetrated
like
corrugating
acid
into
the
traditional
modes
of
rural
existence
founded
on
natural
economy
the
gentile
constitution
is
absolutely
irreconcilable
with
money
rule
the
ruin
of
the
attic
farmers
coïncided
with
the
loosening
of
the
old
gentile
bonds
that
protected
them
the
debtor
receipt
and
the
pawning
of
the
property
for
the
mortgage
was
also
invented
by
the
athenians
cared
neither
for
the
gens
nor
for
the
phratry
but
the
old
gentile
constitution
knew
nothing
of
money
advance
and
debt
hence
the
ever
more
virulently
spreading
money
rule
of
the
nobility
developed
a
new
legal
custom
securing
the
creditor
against
the
debtor
and
sanctioning
the
exploitation
of
the
small
farmer
by
the
wealthy
all
the
rural
districts
of
attica
were
crowded
with
mortgage
columns
bearing
the
legend
that
the
lot
on
which
they
stood
was
mortgaged
to
such
and
such
for
so
much
the
fields
that
were
not
so
designated
had
for
the
most
part
been
sold
on
account
of
overdue
mortgages
or
interest
and
transferred
to
the
aristocratic
usurers
the
farmer
could
thank
his
stars
if
he
was
granted
permission
to
live
as
a
tenant
on
of
the
product
of
his
labor
and
to
pay
to
his
new
master
in
the
form
of
rent
worse
still
if
the
sale
of
the
lot
did
not
bring
sufficient
returns
to
cover
the
debt
or
if
such
a
debt
had
been
contracted
without
a
lien
then
the
debtor
had
to
sell
his
children
into
slavery
abroad
in
order
to
satisfy
the
claim
of
the
creditor
the
sale
of
the
children
by
the
father
that
was
the
first
fruit
of
paternal
law
and
monogamy
and
if
that
did
not
satisfy
the
bloodsuckers
they
could
sell
the
debtor
himself
into
slavery
such
was
the
pleasant
dawn
of
civilization
among
the
people
of
attica
formerly
while
the
condition
of
the
people
was
in
keeping
with
gentile
traditions
a
similar
downfall
would
have
been
impossible
but
here
it
had
come
about
nobody
knew
how
let
us
return
for
a
moment
to
the
iroquois
the
state
of
things
that
had
imposed
itself
on
the
athenians
almost
without
their
doing
so
to
say
and
assuredly
against
their
will
was
inconceivable
among
the
indians
there
the
ever
unchanging
mode
of
production
could
at
no
time
generate
such
conflicts
as
a
distinction
between
rich
and
poor
exploiters
and
exploited
caused
by
external
conditions
the
iroquois
were
far
from
controlling
the
forces
of
nature
but
within
the
limits
drawn
for
them
by
nature
they
dominated
their
own
production
apart
from
a
failure
of
the
crops
in
their
little
gardens
the
exhaustion
of
the
fish
supply
in
their
lakes
and
rivers
or
of
the
game
stock
in
their
forests
they
always
knew
what
would
be
the
outcome
of
their
mode
of
gaining
a
living
a
more
or
less
abundant
supply
of
food
that
would
come
of
it
but
the
outcome
could
never
be
any
unpremeditated
social
upheavals
breaking
of
gentile
bonds
or
division
of
the
gentiles
against
one
another
by
conflicting
class
interests
production
was
carried
on
in
the
most
limited
manner
but
the
producers
controlled
their
own
product
this
immense
advantage
of
barbarian
production
was
lost
in
the
transition
to
civilization
to
win
it
back
on
the
basis
of
man
present
gigantic
control
of
nature
and
of
the
free
association
rendered
possible
by
it
that
will
be
the
task
of
the
next
generations
not
so
among
the
greeks
the
advent
of
private
property
in
herds
of
cattle
and
articles
of
luxury
led
to
an
exchange
between
individuals
to
a
transformation
of
products
into
commodities
here
is
the
root
of
the
entire
revolution
that
followed
when
the
producers
did
no
longer
consume
their
own
product
but
released
their
hold
of
it
in
exchange
for
another
product
then
they
lost
the
control
of
it
they
did
not
know
any
more
what
became
of
it
there
was
a
possibility
that
the
product
might
be
turned
against
the
producers
for
the
purpose
of
exploiting
and
oppressing
them
no
society
can
therefore
retain
for
any
length
of
time
the
control
of
its
own
production
and
of
the
social
effects
of
the
mode
of
production
unless
it
abolishes
exchange
between
individuals
how
rapidly
after
the
establishment
of
individual
exchange
and
after
the
transformation
of
products
into
commodities
the
product
manifests
its
rule
over
the
producer
the
athenians
were
soon
to
learn
along
with
the
production
of
marketable
commodities
came
the
tilling
of
the
soil
by
individual
cultivators
for
their
own
account
soon
followed
by
individual
ownership
of
the
land
along
came
also
the
money
that
general
commodity
for
which
all
others
could
be
exchanged
but
when
men
invented
money
they
little
suspected
that
they
were
creating
a
new
social
power
that
one
universal
power
before
which
the
whole
of
society
must
bow
down
it
was
this
new
power
suddenly
sprung
into
existence
without
the
forethought
and
intention
of
its
own
creators
that
vented
its
rule
on
the
athenians
with
the
full
brutality
of
youth
what
was
to
be
done
the
old
gentile
organization
had
not
only
proved
impotent
against
the
triumphant
march
of
money
it
was
also
absolutely
incapable
of
containing
within
its
confines
any
such
thing
as
money
creditors
debtors
and
forcible
collection
of
debts
but
the
new
social
power
was
upon
them
and
neither
pious
wishes
nor
a
longing
for
the
return
of
the
good
old
times
could
drive
money
and
usury
from
the
face
of
the
earth
moreover
gentile
constitution
had
suffered
a
number
of
minor
defeats
the
indiscriminate
mingling
of
the
gentiles
and
phrators
in
the
whole
of
attica
and
especially
in
athens
had
assumed
larger
proportions
from
generation
to
generation
still
even
now
a
citizen
of
athens
was
not
allowed
to
sell
his
residence
outside
of
his
gens
although
he
could
do
so
with
plots
of
land
the
division
of
labor
between
the
different
branches
of
production
agriculture
trades
numberless
specialties
within
the
trades
commerce
navigation
had
developed
more
fully
with
the
progress
of
industry
and
traffic
the
population
was
now
divided
according
to
occupations
into
rather
well
defined
groups
everyone
of
which
had
separate
interests
not
guarded
by
the
gens
or
phratry
and
therefore
necessitating
the
creation
of
new
offices
the
number
of
slaves
had
increased
considerably
and
must
have
surpassed
by
far
that
of
the
free
athenians
even
at
this
early
stage
gentile
society
originally
knew
no
slavery
and
was
therefore
ignorant
of
any
means
to
hold
this
mass
of
bondsmen
in
check
and
finally
commerce
had
attracted
a
great
many
strangers
who
settled
in
athens
for
the
sake
of
the
easier
living
it
afforded
according
to
the
old
constitution
the
strangers
had
neither
civil
rights
nor
the
protection
of
the
law
though
tacitly
admitted
by
tradition
they
remained
a
disturbing
and
foreign
element
in
short
gentile
constitution
approached
its
doom
society
was
daily
growing
more
and
more
beyond
it
it
was
powerless
to
stop
or
allay
even
the
most
distressing
evils
that
had
grown
under
its
very
eyes
but
in
the
meantime
the
state
had
secretly
developed
the
new
groups
formed
by
division
of
labor
first
between
city
and
country
then
between
the
various
branches
of
city
industry
had
created
new
organs
for
the
care
of
their
interests
public
offices
of
every
description
had
been
instituted
and
above
all
the
young
state
needed
its
own
fighting
forces
among
the
seafaring
athenians
this
had
to
be
at
first
only
a
navy
for
occasional
short
expeditions
and
the
protection
of
the
merchant
vessels
at
some
uncertain
time
before
solon
the
naukrariai
were
instituted
little
territorial
districts
twelve
in
each
tribe
every
naukraria
had
to
furnish
equip
and
man
a
war
vessel
and
to
detail
two
horsemen
this
arrangement
was
a
twofold
attack
on
the
gentile
constitution
in
the
first
place
it
created
a
public
power
of
coërcion
that
did
no
longer
absolutely
coincide
with
the
entirety
of
the
armed
nation
in
the
second
place
it
was
the
first
division
of
the
people
for
public
purposes
not
by
groups
of
kinship
but
by
local
residence
we
shall
soon
see
what
that
signified
as
the
gentile
constitution
could
not
come
to
the
assistance
of
the
exploited
people
they
could
look
only
to
the
rising
state
and
the
state
brought
help
in
the
form
of
the
constitution
of
solon
at
the
same
time
it
added
to
its
own
strength
at
the
expense
of
the
old
constitution
solon
opened
the
series
of
political
revolutions
by
an
infringement
on
private
property
we
pass
over
the
means
by
which
this
reform
was
accomplished
in
the
year
or
thereabout
ever
since
all
revolutions
have
been
revolutions
for
the
protection
of
one
kind
of
property
against
another
kind
of
property
they
can
not
protect
one
kind
without
violating
another
in
the
great
french
revolution
the
feudal
property
was
sacrificed
for
the
sake
of
saving
bourgeois
property
in
solon
revolution
the
property
of
the
creditors
had
to
make
concessions
to
the
property
of
the
debtors
the
debts
were
simply
declared
illegal
we
are
not
acquainted
with
the
accurate
details
but
solon
boasts
in
his
poëms
that
he
removed
the
mortgage
columns
from
the
indented
lots
and
enabled
all
who
had
fled
or
been
sold
abroad
for
debts
to
return
home
this
was
only
feasible
by
an
open
violation
of
private
property
and
indeed
all
political
revolutions
were
started
for
the
protection
of
one
kind
of
property
by
the
confiscation
also
called
theft
of
another
kind
of
property
it
is
absolutely
true
that
for
more
than
years
private
property
could
only
be
protected
by
the
violation
of
private
property
but
now
a
way
had
to
be
found
to
avoid
the
return
of
such
an
enslavement
of
the
free
athenians
this
was
first
attempted
by
general
measures
the
prohibition
of
contracts
giving
the
person
of
the
debtor
in
lien
furthermore
a
maximum
limit
was
fixed
for
the
amount
of
land
any
one
individual
could
own
in
order
to
keep
the
craving
of
the
nobility
for
the
land
of
the
farmers
within
reasonable
bounds
constitutional
amendments
were
next
in
order
the
following
deserve
special
consideration
the
council
was
increased
to
four
hundred
members
one
hundred
from
each
tribe
here
then
the
tribe
still
served
as
a
basis
but
this
was
the
only
remnant
of
the
old
constitution
that
was
transferred
to
the
new
body
politic
for
otherwise
solon
divided
the
citizens
into
four
classes
according
to
their
property
in
land
and
its
yield
five
hundred
three
hundred
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
medimnoi
of
grain
medimnos
equals
bushels
were
the
minimum
yields
of
the
first
three
classes
whoever
had
less
land
or
none
at
all
belonged
to
the
fourth
class
only
members
of
the
first
three
classes
could
hold
office
the
highest
offices
were
filled
by
the
first
class
the
fourth
class
had
only
the
right
to
speak
and
vote
in
the
public
council
but
here
all
officials
were
elected
here
they
had
to
give
account
here
all
the
laws
were
made
and
here
the
fourth
class
was
in
the
majority
the
aristocratic
privileges
were
partly
renewed
in
the
form
of
privileges
of
wealth
but
the
people
retained
the
decisive
power
the
four
classes
also
formed
the
basis
for
the
reorganization
of
the
fighting
forces
the
first
two
classes
furnished
the
horsemen
the
third
had
to
serve
as
heavy
infantry
the
fourth
was
employed
as
light
unarmored
infantry
and
had
to
man
the
navy
probably
the
last
class
also
received
wages
in
this
case
an
entirely
new
element
is
thus
introduced
into
the
constitution
private
property
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
citizens
are
graduated
according
to
their
property
in
land
wherever
the
classification
by
property
gains
ground
there
the
old
groups
of
blood
relationship
give
way
gentile
constitution
has
suffered
another
defeat
however
the
gradation
of
political
rights
according
to
private
property
was
not
one
of
those
institutions
without
which
a
state
can
not
exist
it
may
have
been
ever
so
important
in
the
constitutional
development
of
some
states
still
a
good
many
others
and
the
most
completely
developed
at
that
had
no
need
of
it
even
in
athens
it
played
only
a
passing
role
since
the
time
of
aristides
all
offices
were
open
to
all
the
citizens
during
the
next
eighty
years
the
athenian
society
gradually
drifted
into
the
course
on
which
it
further
developed
in
the
following
centuries
the
outrageous
land
speculation
of
the
time
before
solon
had
been
fettered
likewise
the
excessive
concentration
of
property
in
land
commerce
trades
and
artisan
handicrafts
which
were
carried
on
in
an
ever
larger
scale
as
slave
labor
increased
became
the
ruling
factors
in
gaining
a
living
public
enlightenment
advanced
instead
of
exploiting
their
own
fellow
citizens
in
the
old
brutal
style
the
athenians
now
exploited
mainly
the
slaves
and
the
customers
outside
movable
property
wealth
in
money
slaves
and
ships
increased
more
and
more
but
instead
of
being
a
simple
means
for
the
purchase
of
land
as
in
the
old
stupid
times
it
had
now
become
an
end
in
itself
the
new
class
of
industrial
and
commercial
owners
of
wealth
now
waged
a
victorious
competition
against
the
old
nobility
the
remnants
of
the
old
gentile
constitution
lost
their
last
hold
the
gentes
phratries
and
tribes
the
members
of
which
now
were
dispersed
all
over
attica
and
completely
intermixed
had
thus
become
unavailable
as
political
groups
a
great
many
citizens
of
athens
did
not
belong
to
any
gens
they
were
immigrants
who
had
been
adopted
into
citizenship
but
not
into
any
of
the
old
groups
of
kinship
besides
there
was
a
steadily
increasing
number
of
foreign
immigrants
who
were
only
protected
by
traditional
sufferance
meanwhile
the
struggles
of
the
parties
proceeded
the
nobility
tried
to
regain
their
former
privileges
and
for
a
short
time
recovered
their
supremacy
until
the
revolution
of
kleisthenes
brought
their
final
downfall
and
completed
the
ruin
of
gentile
law
in
his
new
constitution
kleisthenes
ignored
the
four
old
tribes
founded
on
the
gentes
and
phratries
their
place
was
taken
by
an
entirely
new
organization
based
on
the
recently
attempted
division
of
the
citizens
into
naukrariai
according
to
residence
no
longer
was
membership
in
a
group
of
kindred
the
dominant
fact
but
simply
local
residence
not
the
nation
but
the
territory
was
now
divided
the
inhabitants
became
mere
political
fixtures
of
the
territory
the
whole
of
attica
was
divided
into
one
hundred
communal
districts
demoi
every
one
of
which
was
autonomous
the
citizens
living
in
a
demos
demotoi
elected
their
official
head
demarchos
treasurer
and
thirty
judges
with
jurisdiction
in
minor
cases
they
also
received
their
own
temple
and
divine
guardian
or
heros
whose
priest
they
elected
the
control
of
the
demos
was
in
the
hands
of
the
council
of
demotoì
this
is
as
morgan
correctly
remarks
the
prototype
of
the
autonomous
american
township
the
modern
state
in
its
highest
development
ended
in
the
same
unit
with
which
the
rising
state
began
its
career
in
athens
ten
of
these
units
demoi
formed
a
tribe
which
however
was
now
designated
as
local
tribe
in
order
to
distinguish
it
from
the
old
sex
tribe
the
local
tribe
was
not
only
an
autonomous
political
but
also
a
military
group
it
elected
the
phylarchos
or
tribal
head
who
commanded
the
horsemen
the
taxiarchos
commanding
the
infantry
and
the
strategic
leader
who
was
in
command
of
the
entire
contingent
raised
in
the
tribal
territory
by
conscription
the
local
tribe
furthermore
furnished
equipped
and
fully
manned
five
war
vessels
it
was
designated
by
the
name
of
the
attic
hero
who
was
its
guardian
deity
it
elected
fifty
councilmen
into
the
council
of
athens
thus
we
arrive
at
the
athenian
state
governed
by
a
council
of
five
hundred
elected
by
and
representing
the
ten
tribes
and
subject
to
the
vote
of
the
public
meeting
where
every
citizen
could
enter
and
vote
archons
and
other
officials
attended
to
the
different
departments
of
administration
and
justice
by
this
new
constitution
and
by
the
admission
of
a
large
number
of
aliens
partly
freed
slaves
partly
immigrants
the
organs
of
gentile
constitution
were
displaced
in
public
affairs
they
became
mere
private
and
religious
clubs
but
their
moral
influence
the
traditional
conceptions
and
views
of
the
old
gentile
period
survived
for
a
long
time
and
expired
only
gradually
this
was
evident
in
another
state
institution
we
have
seen
that
an
essential
mark
of
the
state
consists
in
a
public
power
of
coërcion
divorced
from
the
mass
of
the
people
athens
possessed
at
that
time
only
a
militia
and
a
navy
equipped
and
manned
directly
by
the
people
these
afforded
protection
against
external
enemies
and
held
the
slaves
in
check
who
at
that
time
already
made
up
the
large
majority
of
the
population
for
the
citizens
this
coërcive
power
at
first
only
existed
in
the
shape
of
the
police
which
is
as
old
as
the
state
the
innocent
frenchmen
of
the
century
therefore
had
the
habit
of
speaking
not
of
civilized
but
of
policed
nations
nations
policées
the
athenians
then
provided
for
a
police
in
their
new
state
a
veritable
force
of
bowmen
on
foot
and
horseback
this
police
force
consisted
of
slaves
the
free
athenian
regarded
this
police
duty
as
so
degrading
that
he
preferred
being
arrested
by
an
armed
slave
rather
than
lending
himself
to
such
an
ignominious
service
that
was
still
a
sign
of
the
old
gentile
spirit
the
state
could
not
exist
without
a
police
but
as
yet
it
was
too
young
and
did
not
command
sufficient
moral
respect
to
give
prestige
to
an
occupation
that
necessarily
appeared
ignominious
to
the
old
gentiles
how
well
this
state
now
completed
in
its
main
outlines
suited
the
social
condition
of
the
athenians
was
apparent
by
the
rapid
growth
of
wealth
commerce
and
industry
the
distinction
of
classes
on
which
the
social
and
political
institutions
are
resting
was
no
longer
between
nobility
and
common
people
but
between
slaves
and
freemen
aliens
and
citizens
at
the
time
of
the
greatest
prosperity
the
whole
number
of
free
athenian
citizens
women
and
children
included
amounted
to
about
the
slaves
of
both
sexes
numbered
and
the
aliens
foreigners
and
freed
slaves
per
capita
of
each
adult
citizen
there
were
therefore
at
least
eighteen
slaves
and
more
than
two
aliens
the
great
number
of
slaves
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
many
of
them
worked
together
in
large
factories
under
supervision
the
development
of
commerce
and
industry
brought
about
an
accumulation
and
concentration
of
wealth
in
a
few
hands
the
mass
of
the
free
citizens
were
impoverished
and
had
to
face
the
choice
of
either
competing
with
their
own
labor
against
slave
labor
which
was
considered
ignoble
and
vile
besides
promising
little
success
or
to
be
ruined
under
the
prevailing
circumstances
they
necessarily
chose
the
latter
course
and
being
in
the
majority
they
ruined
the
whole
attic
state
not
democracy
caused
the
downfall
of
athens
as
the
european
glorifiers
of
princes
and
lickspittle
schoolmasters
would
have
us
believe
but
slavery
ostracizing
the
labor
of
the
free
citizen
the
origin
of
the
state
among
the
athenians
presents
a
very
typical
form
of
state
organization
for
it
took
place
without
any
marring
external
interference
or
internal
obstruction
the
usurpation
of
pisistratos
left
no
trace
of
its
short
duration
it
shows
the
direct
rise
of
a
highly
developed
form
of
a
state
the
democratic
republic
out
of
gentile
society
and
finally
we
are
sufficiently
acquainted
with
all
the
essential
details
of
the
process
chapter
vi
gens
and
state
in
rome
the
legend
of
the
foundation
of
rome
sets
forth
that
the
first
colonization
was
undertaken
by
a
number
of
latin
gentes
one
hundred
so
the
legend
says
united
into
one
tribe
a
sabellian
tribe
also
said
to
consist
of
one
hundred
gentes
soon
followed
and
finally
a
third
tribe
of
various
elements
but
again
numbering
one
hundred
gentes
joined
them
the
whole
tale
reveals
at
the
first
glance
that
little
more
than
the
gens
was
borrowed
from
reality
and
that
the
gens
itself
was
in
certain
cases
only
an
offshoot
of
an
old
mother
gens
still
existing
at
home
the
tribes
bear
the
mark
of
artificial
composition
on
their
foreheads
still
they
were
made
up
of
kindred
elements
and
after
the
model
of
the
old
spontaneous
not
artificial
tribe
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
impossible
that
a
genuine
old
tribe
formed
the
nucleus
of
every
one
of
these
three
tribes
the
connecting
link
the
phratry
contained
ten
gentes
and
was
called
curia
hence
there
were
thirty
curiae
the
roman
gens
is
recognized
as
an
institution
identical
with
the
grecian
gens
the
grecian
gens
being
a
continuation
of
the
same
social
unit
the
primordial
form
of
which
we
found
among
the
american
indians
the
same
holds
naturally
good
of
the
roman
gens
and
we
can
be
more
concise
in
its
treatment
at
least
during
the
most
ancient
times
of
the
city
the
roman
gens
had
the
following
constitution
mutual
right
of
inheritance
for
gentiles
the
wealth
remained
in
the
gens
paternal
law
being
already
in
force
in
the
roman
the
same
as
in
the
grecian
gens
the
offspring
of
female
lineage
were
excluded
according
to
the
law
of
the
twelve
tablets
the
oldest
written
law
of
rome
known
to
us
the
natural
children
had
the
first
title
to
the
estate
in
case
no
natural
children
existed
the
agnati
kin
of
male
lineage
took
their
place
and
last
in
line
came
the
gentiles
in
all
cases
the
property
remained
in
the
gens
here
we
observe
the
gradual
introduction
of
new
legal
provisions
caused
by
increased
wealth
and
monogamy
into
the
gentile
practice
the
originally
equal
right
of
inheritance
of
the
gentiles
was
first
limited
in
practice
to
the
agnati
no
doubt
at
a
very
remote
date
and
afterwards
to
the
natural
children
and
their
offspring
of
male
lineage
of
course
this
appears
in
the
reverse
order
on
the
twelve
tablets
possession
of
a
common
burial
ground
the
patrician
gens
claudia
on
immigrating
into
rome
from
regilli
was
assigned
to
a
separate
lot
of
land
and
received
its
own
burial
ground
in
the
city
as
late
as
the
time
of
augustus
the
head
of
varus
who
had
been
killed
in
the
teutoburger
wald
was
brought
to
rome
and
interred
in
the
gentilitius
tumulus
hence
his
gens
quinctilia
still
had
its
own
tomb
common
religious
rites
these
are
under
the
name
of
sacra
gentilitia
obligation
not
to
intermarry
in
the
gens
it
seems
that
this
was
never
a
written
law
in
rome
but
the
custom
remained
among
the
innumerable
names
of
roman
couples
preserved
for
us
there
is
not
a
single
case
where
husband
and
wife
had
the
same
gentile
name
the
law
of
inheritance
proves
the
same
rule
by
marrying
a
woman
loses
her
agnatic
privileges
discards
her
gens
and
neither
she
nor
her
children
have
any
title
to
her
father
estate
nor
to
that
of
his
brothers
because
otherwise
the
gens
of
her
father
would
lose
his
property
this
rule
has
a
meaning
only
then
when
the
woman
is
not
permitted
to
marry
a
gentile
a
common
piece
of
land
in
primeval
days
this
was
always
obtained
when
the
tribal
territory
was
first
divided
among
the
latin
tribes
we
find
the
land
partly
in
the
possession
of
the
tribe
partly
of
the
gens
and
partly
of
the
households
that
could
hardly
represent
single
families
at
such
an
early
date
romulus
is
credited
with
being
the
first
to
assign
land
to
single
individuals
about
acres
two
jugera
per
head
but
later
on
we
still
find
some
land
in
the
hands
of
the
gentes
not
to
mention
the
state
land
around
which
turns
the
whole
internal
history
of
the
republic
duty
of
the
gentiles
to
mutually
protect
and
assist
one
another
written
history
records
only
remnants
of
this
law
the
roman
state
from
the
outset
manifested
such
superior
power
that
the
duty
of
protection
against
injury
devolved
upon
it
when
appius
claudius
was
arrested
his
whole
gens
including
his
personal
enemies
dressed
in
mourning
at
the
time
of
the
second
punic
war
the
gentes
united
for
the
purpose
of
ransoming
their
captured
gentiles
the
senate
vetoed
this
right
to
bear
the
gentile
name
this
was
in
force
until
the
time
of
the
emperors
freed
slaves
were
permitted
to
assume
the
gentile
name
of
their
former
master
but
this
did
not
bestow
any
gentile
rights
on
them
right
of
adopting
strangers
into
the
gens
this
was
done
by
adoption
into
the
family
the
same
as
among
the
indians
which
brought
with
it
the
adoption
into
the
gens
the
right
to
elect
and
depose
chiefs
is
not
mentioned
anywhere
but
inasmuch
as
during
the
first
years
of
rome
existence
all
offices
were
filled
by
election
or
nomination
from
the
king
downward
and
as
the
curiae
elected
also
their
own
priests
we
are
justified
in
assuming
the
same
in
regard
to
gentile
chiefs
principes
no
matter
how
well
established
the
rule
of
choosing
the
candidates
from
the
same
family
have
been
such
were
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
roman
gens
with
the
exception
of
the
completed
transition
to
paternal
law
they
are
the
true
image
of
the
rights
and
duties
of
an
iroquois
gens
here
also
the
iroquois
is
still
plainly
visible
how
confused
the
ideas
of
our
historians
even
the
most
prominent
of
them
are
when
it
comes
to
a
discussion
of
the
roman
gens
is
shown
by
the
following
example
in
mommsen
treatise
on
the
roman
family
names
of
the
republican
and
augustinian
era
römische
forschungen
berlin
vol
i
he
writes
the
gentile
name
was
not
only
borne
by
all
male
gentiles
including
all
adopted
and
wards
except
of
course
the
slaves
but
also
by
the
women
the
tribe
so
mommsen
translates
gens
is
a
common
organization
resulting
from
a
common
actual
assumed
or
even
invented
ancestor
and
united
by
common
rites
burial
grounds
and
customs
of
inheritance
all
free
individuals
hence
women
also
may
and
must
claim
membership
in
them
but
the
definition
of
the
gentile
name
of
the
married
women
offers
some
difficulty
this
is
indeed
obviated
as
long
as
women
were
not
permitted
to
marry
any
one
but
their
gentiles
and
we
have
proofs
that
for
a
long
time
the
women
found
it
much
more
difficult
to
marry
outside
than
inside
of
the
gens
this
right
of
marrying
outside
the
gentis
enuptio
was
still
bestowed
as
a
personal
privilege
and
reward
during
the
sixth
century
but
wherever
such
outside
marriages
occurred
in
primeval
times
the
woman
must
have
been
transferred
to
the
tribe
of
her
husband
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
by
the
old
religious
marriage
woman
was
completely
adopted
into
the
legal
and
sacramental
group
of
her
husband
and
divorced
from
her
own
who
does
not
know
that
the
married
woman
releases
her
active
and
passive
right
of
inheritance
in
favor
of
her
gentiles
but
enters
the
legal
group
of
her
husband
her
children
and
his
gentiles
and
if
her
husband
adopts
her
as
his
child
into
his
family
how
can
she
remain
separated
from
his
gens
pages
here
mommsen
asserts
that
the
roman
women
belonging
to
a
certain
gens
were
originally
free
to
marry
only
within
their
gens
the
roman
gens
according
to
him
was
therefore
endogamous
not
exogamous
this
opinion
which
contradicts
the
evidence
of
all
other
nations
is
principally
if
not
exclusively
founded
on
a
single
much
disputed
passage
of
livy
book
xxxix
according
to
this
passage
the
senate
decreed
in
the
year
of
the
city
uti
feceniae
hispallae

gentis
enuptio
tutoris

qui

ob

ignominiaeve
esset
that
fecenia
hispalla
shall
have
the
right
to
dispose
of
her
property
to
diminish
it
to
marry
outside
of
the
gens
to
choose
a
guardian
just
as
if
her
late
husband
had
conferred
this
right
on
her
by
testament
that
she
shall
be
permitted
to
marry
a
freeman
and
that
for
the
man
who
marries
her
this
shall
not
constitute
a
misdemeanor
or
a
shame
without
a
doubt
fecenia
a
freed
slave
here
obtains
permission
to
marry
outside
of
the
gens
and
equally
doubtless
the
husband
here
has
the
right
to
confer
on
his
wife
by
testament
the
right
to
marry
outside
of
the
gens
after
his
death
but
outside
of
which
gens
if
a
woman
had
to
intermarry
in
the
gens
as
mommsen
assumes
then
she
remained
in
this
gens
after
her
marriage
but
in
the
first
place
this
assertion
of
an
endogamous
gens
must
be
proven
and
in
the
second
place
if
the
women
had
to
intermarry
in
the
gens
then
the
men
had
to
do
the
same
otherwise
there
could
be
no
marriage
then
we
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
man
could
bequeath
a
right
to
his
wife
which
he
did
not
have
for
himself
this
is
a
legal
impossibility
mommsen
feels
this
very
well
and
hence
he
supposes
the
marriage
outside
of
the
gens
most
probably
required
not
only
the
consent
of
the
testator
but
of
all
gentiles
page
footnote
this
is
not
only
a
very
daring
assertion
but
contradicts
also
the
clear
wording
of
the
passage
the
senate
gives
her
this
right
as
a
proxy
of
her
husband
they
expressly
give
her
no
more
and
no
less
than
her
husband
could
have
given
her
but
what
they
do
give
is
an
absolute
right
independent
of
all
limitations
so
that
if
she
should
make
use
of
it
her
new
husband
shall
not
suffer
in
consequence
the
senate
even
instructs
the
present
and
future
consuls
and
praetors
to
see
that
no
inconvenience
arise
to
her
from
the
use
of
this
right
mommsen
supposition
is
therefore
absolutely
inadmissible
then
again
suppose
a
woman
married
a
man
from
another
gens
but
remained
in
her
own
gens
according
to
the
passage
quoted
above
her
husband
would
then
have
had
the
right
to
permit
his
wife
to
marry
outside
of
her
own
gens
that
is
he
would
have
had
the
right
to
make
provisions
in
regard
to
the
affairs
of
a
gens
to
which
he
did
not
belong
at
all
the
thing
is
so
utterly
unreasonable
that
we
need
not
lose
any
words
about
it
nothing
remains
but
to
assume
that
the
woman
in
her
first
marriage
wedded
a
man
from
another
gens
and
thereby
became
a
member
of
her
husband
gens
mommsen
admits
this
for
such
cases
then
the
whole
matter
at
once
explains
itself
the
woman
torn
away
from
her
old
gens
by
her
marriage
and
adopted
into
the
gentile
group
of
her
husband
occupies
a
peculiar
position
in
the
new
gens
she
is
now
a
gentile
but
not
a
kin
by
blood
the
manner
of
her
entrance
from
the
outset
excludes
all
prohibition
of
intermarrying
in
the
gens
into
which
she
has
come
by
marriage
she
is
adopted
into
the
family
relations
of
the
gens
and
inherits
some
of
the
property
of
her
husband
when
he
dies
the
property
of
a
gentile
what
is
more
natural
than
that
this
property
should
remain
in
the
gens
and
that
she
should
be
obliged
to
marry
a
gentile
of
her
husband
and
no
other
if
however
an
exception
is
to
be
made
who
is
so
well
entitled
to
authorize
her
as
her
first
husband
who
bequeathed
his
property
to
her
at
the
moment
when
he
bequeathes
on
her
a
part
of
his
property
and
simultaneously
gives
her
permission
to
transfer
this
property
by
marriage
or
as
a
result
of
marriage
to
a
strange
gens
he
still
is
the
owner
of
this
property
hence
he
literally
disposes
of
his
personal
property
as
for
the
woman
and
her
relation
to
the
gens
of
her
husband
it
is
he
who
by
an
act
of
his
own
free
will
the
marriage
introduced
her
into
his
gens
therefore
it
seems
quite
natural
that
he
should
be
the
proper
person
to
authorize
her
to
leave
this
gens
by
another
marriage
in
short
the
matter
appears
simple
and
obvious
as
soon
as
we
discard
the
absurd
conception
of
an
endogamous
roman
gens
and
accept
morgan
originally
exogamous
gens
there
is
still
another
view
which
has
probably
found
the
greatest
number
of
advocates
according
to
them
the
passage
in
livy
only
means
that
freed
slave
girls
libertae
can
not
without
special
permission
e
gente
enubere
marry
outside
of
the
gens
or
undertake
any
of
the
steps
which
together
with
capitis
deminutio
minima
the
loss
of
family
rights
would
lead
to
a
transfer
of
the
liberta
to
another
gens
lange
römische
alterthümer
berlin
i
where
our
passage
from
livy
is
explained
by
a
reference
to
huschke
if
this
view
is
correct
then
the
passage
proves
still
less
for
the
relations
of
free
roman
women
and
there
is
so
much
less
ground
for
speaking
of
their
obligation
to
intermarry
in
the
gens
the
expression
enuptio
gentis
marriage
outside
of
the
gens
occurs
only
in
this
single
passage
and
is
not
found
anywhere
else
in
the
entire
roman
literature
the
word
enubere
to
marry
outside
is
found
only
three
times
likewise
in
livy
and
not
in
reference
to
the
gens
the
phantastic
idea
that
roman
women
had
to
intermarry
in
the
gens
owes
its
existence
only
to
this
single
passage
but
it
can
not
be
maintained
for
either
the
passage
refers
to
special
restrictions
for
freed
slave
women
in
which
case
it
proves
nothing
for
free
women
ingenuae
or
it
applies
also
to
free
women
in
which
case
it
rather
proves
that
the
women
as
a
rule
married
outside
of
the
gens
and
were
transferred
by
their
marriage
to
their
husbands
gens
this
would
be
a
point
for
morgan
against
mommsen
almost
three
hundred
years
after
the
foundation
of
rome
the
gentile
bonds
were
still
so
strong
that
a
patrician
gens
the
fabians
could
obtain
permission
from
the
senate
to
undertake
all
by
itself
a
war
expedition
against
the
neighboring

three
hundred

six

said
to
have

to
have

only

to

said
formed
a
phratry
named
curia
it
was
endowed
with
more
important
functions
than
the
grecian

every
curia
had
its
own
religious
rites
sacred
possessions
and

the

formed
a

which
probably
had
originally
its
own
elected

leader
in

and
high
priest
like
the
rest
of
the
latin
tribes
the
three
tribes
together
formed
the
populus
romanus
the
roman
people
hence
nobody
could
belong
to
the
roman
people
unless
he
was
a
member
of
a
roman
gens
and
thus
a
member
of
a
curia
and
tribe
the
first
constitution
of
the
roman
people
was
as
follows
public
affairs
were
conducted
by
the
senate
composed
as
niebuhr
was
the
first
to
state
correctly
of
the
chiefs
of
the
three
hundred
gentes
because
they
were
the
elders
of
the
gentes
they
were
called
patres
fathers
and
as
a
body
senatus
council
of
elders
from
senex
old
here
also
the
customary
choice
of
men
from
the
same
family
of
the
gens
brought
to
life
the
first
hereditary
nobility
these
families
were
called
patricians
and
claimed
the
exclusive
right
to
the
seats
in
the
senate
and
to
all
other
offices
the
fact
that
in
the
course
of
time
the
people
admitted
this
claim
so
that
it
became
an
actual
privilege
is
confirmed
by
the
legendary
report
that
romulus
bestowed
the
rank
of
patrician
and
its
privileges
on
the
first
senators
the
senate
like
the
athenian
boulê
had
to
make
the
final
decision
in
many
affairs
and
to
undertake
the
preliminary
discussion
of
more
important
matters
especially
of
new
laws
these
were
settled
by
the
public
meeting
the
comitia
curiata
assembly
of
curiae
the
people
met
in
curiae
probably
grouped
by
gentes
and
every
one
of
the
thirty
curiae
had
one
vote
the
assembly
of
curiae
adopted
or
rejected
all
laws
elected
all
higher
officials
including
the
rex
king
declared
war
but
the
senate
concluded
peace
and
decided
as
a
supreme
court
on
appeal
all
cases
involving
capital
punishment
of
roman
citizens
by
the
side
of
the
senate
and
the
public
meeting
stood
the
rex
corresponding
to
the
grecian
basileus
and
by
no
means
such
an
almost
absolute
king
as
mommsen
would
have
it
the
rex
was
also
a
military
leader
a
high
priest
and
a
chairman
of
certain
courts
he
had
no
other
functions
nor
any
power
over
life
liberty
and
property
of
the
citizens
except
such
as
resulted
from
his
disciplinary
power
as
military
leader
or
from
his
executive
power
as
president
of
a
court
the
office
of
rex
was
not
hereditary
on
the
contrary
he
was
elected
probably
on
the
suggestion
of
his
predecessor
by
the
assembly
of
curiae
and
then
solemnly
invested
by
a
second
assembly
that
he
could
also
be
deposed
is
proved
by
the
fate
of
tarquinius
superbus
as
the
greeks
at
the
time
of
the
heroes
so
the
romans
at
the
time
of
the
kings
lived
in
a
military
democracy
based
on
and
developed
from
a
constitution
of
gentes
phratries
and
tribes
what
though
the
curiae
and
tribes
were
partly
artificial
formations
they
were
moulded
after
the
genuine
and
spontaneous
models
of
a
society
from
which
they
originated
and
that
still
surrounded
them
on
all
sides
and
though
the
sturdy
patrician
nobility
had
already
gained
ground
though
the
reges
attempted
gradually
to
enlarge
the
scope
of
their
functions
all
this
does
not
change
the
elementary
and
fundamental
character
of
the
constitution
and
this
alone
is
essential
meantime
the
population
of
the
city
of
rome
and
of
the
roman
territory
enlarged
by
conquest
increased
partly
by
immigration
partly
through
the
inhabitants
of
the
annexed
districts
latins
most
of
them
all
these
new
members
of
the
state
we
disregard
here
the
clients
stood
outside
of
the
old
gentes
curiae
and
tribes
and
so
did
not
form
a
part
of
the
populus
romanus
the
roman
people
proper
they
were
personally
free
could
own
land
had
to
pay
taxes
and
were
subject
to
military
service
but
they
were
not
eligible
to
office
and
could
neither
take
part
in
the
assembly
of
curiae
nor
in
the
distribution
of
conquered
state
lands
they
made
up
the
mass
of
people
excluded
from
all
public
rights
the
plebs
by
their
continually
growing
numbers
their
military
training
and
armament
they
became
a
threat
for
the
old
populus
who
now
closed
their
ranks
hermetically
against
all
new
elements
the
land
seems
to
have
been
about
evenly
divided
between
populus
and
plebs
while
the
mercantile
and
industrial
wealth
though
as
yet
not
very
considerable
may
have
been
mainly
in
the
hands
of
the
plebs
in
view
of
the
utter
darkness
that
enwraps
the
whole
legendary
origin
of
rome
historical
beginning
a
darkness
that
was
rendered
still
more
intense
by
the
rationalistic
and
overofficious
interpretations
and
reports
of
the
juristically
trained
authors
that
wrote
on
the
subject
it
is
impossible
to
make
any
definite
statements
about
the
time
the
course
and
the
motive
of
the
revolution
that
put
an
end
to
the
old
gentile
constitution
we
are
certain
only
that
the
causes
arose
out
of
the
fights
between
the
plebs
and
the
populus
the
new
constitution
attributed
to
rex
servius
tullius
and
following
the
grecian
model
more
especially
that
of
solon
created
a
new
public
assembly
including
or
excluding
all
the
members
of
populus
and
plebs
according
to
whether
they
rendered
military
service
or
not
the
whole
population
subject
to
enlistment
was
divided
into
six
classes
according
to
wealth
the
lowest
limitis
in
the
five
highest
classes
were
ass
which
according
to
dureau
de
la
malle
is
equal
to
about
and
the
sixth
class
the
proletarians
consisted
of
those
who
possessed
less
and
were
exempt
from
military
service
and
taxes
in
this
new
assembly
of
centuriae
comitia
centuriata
the
citizens
formed
ranks
after
the
manner
of
soldiers
in
companies
of
one
hundred
centuria
and
every
centuria
had
one
vote
now
the
first
class
placed
centuriae
in
the
field
the
second
the
third
the
fourth
the
fifth
and
the
sixth
for
sake
one
to
this
were
added
centuriae
of
horsemen
composed
of
the
most
wealthy
hence
there
were
centuriae
giving
a
lowest
majority
vote
of
now
the
horsemen
and
the
first
class
alone
had
together
votes
being
in
the
majority
they
had
only
to
agree
and
they
could
pass
any
resolution
without
asking
the
consent
of
the
other
classes
this
new
assembly
of
centuriae
assumed
all
the
political
rights
of
the
former
assembly
of
curiae
a
few
nominal
privileges
excepted
the
curiae
and
the
gentes
composing
them
now
were
degraded
to
mere
private
and
religious
congregations
analogous
to
their
attic
prototypes
and
as
such
they
vegetated
on
for
a
long
time
but
the
assembly
of
curiae
soon
became
obsolete
in
order
to
drive
also
the
three
old
tribes
out
of
existence
a
system
of
four
local
tribes
was
introduced
every
tribe
was
assigned
to
one
quarter
of
the
city
and
received
certain
political
rights
thus
the
old
social
order
of
blood
kinship
was
destroyed
also
in
rome
even
before
the
abolition
of
the
royalty
a
new
constitution
founded
on
territorial
division
and
difference
of
wealth
took
its
place
and
virtually
created
the
state
the
public
power
of
coërcion
consisted
here
of
citizens
liable
to
military
duty
to
be
used
against
the
slaves
and
the
proletarians
who
were
excluded
from
military
service
and
general
armament
after
the
expulsion
of
the
last
rex
tarquinius
superbus
who
had
really
usurped
royal
power
the
new
constitution
was
further
improved
by
the
institution
of
two
military
leaders
consuls
with
equal
powers
analogous
to
the
custom
of
the
iroquois
the
whole
history
of
the
roman
republic
moves
inside
of
this
constitution
the
struggles
between
patricians
and
plebs
for
admission
to
office
and
participation
in
the
allotment
of
state
lands
the
merging
of
the
patrician
nobility
in
the
new
class
of
large
property
and
money
owners
the
gradual
absorption
by
the
latter
of
all
the
land
of
the
small
holders
who
had
been
ruined
by
military
service
the
cultivation
of
these
enormous
new
tracts
by
slaves
the
resulting
depopulation
of
italy
which
not
only
opened
the
doors
to
the
imperial
tyrants
but
also
to
their
successors

a
few
short
notes
about
the
existence
of
the
gens
among
celts
and
germans
may
find
a
place
here
the
oldest
celtic
laws
preserved
for
us
still
show
the
gens
in
full
bloom
in
ireland
it
is
alive
in
the
popular
instinct
to
this
day
after
it
has
been
forced
out
of
actual
existence
by
the
english
it
was
in
full
force
in
scotland
until
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
here
it
also
succumbed
only
to
the
weapons
laws
and
courts
of
the
english
the
old
welsh
laws
written
several
centuries
before
the
english
invasion
not
later
than
the
century
still
show
collective
agriculture
of
whole
villages
although
only
exceptionally
and
as
the
survival
of
a
former
universal
custom
every
family
had
five
acres
for
its
special
use
another
lot
was
at
the
same
time
cultivated
collectively
and
its
yield
divided
among
the
different
families
in
view
of
irish
and
scotch
analogies
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
these
village
communities
represent
gentes
or
subdivisions
of
gentes
even
though
a
repeated
investigation
of
the
welsh
laws
which
i
can
not
undertake
from
lack
of
time
my
notes
are
from
should
not
directly
corroborate
this
one
thing
however
is
plainly
proven
by
the
welsh
and
irish
laws
namely
that
the
pairing
family
had
not
yet
given
way
to
monogamy
among
the
celts
of
the
century
in
wales
marriage
did
not
become
indissoluble
by
divorce
or
rather
by
notification
until
after
seven
years
even
if
no
more
than
three
nights
were
lacking
to
make
up
the
seven
years
a
married
couple
could
still
separate
their
property
was
divided
among
them
the
woman
made
the
division
the
man
selected
his
share
the
furniture
was
divided
according
to
certain
very
funny
rules
if
the
marriage
was
dissolved
by
the
man
he
had
to
return
the
dowry
and
a
few
other
articles
if
the
woman
wished
a
separation
then
she
received
less
of
three
children
the
man
took
two
the
woman
one
the
second
child
if
the
woman
married
again
after
her
divorce
and
her
first
husband
claimed
her
back
she
was
obliged
to
follow
him
even
if
she
had
one
foot
in
her
new
husband
bed
but
if
two
had
lived
together
for
seven
years
they
were
considered
man
and
wife
even
without
the
preliminaries
of
a
formal
marriage
chasteness
of
the
girls
before
marriage
was
by
no
means
strictly
observed
nor
was
it
required
the
regulations
regarding
this
subject
are
of
an
extremely
frivolous
nature
and
in
contradiction
with
civilized
morals
when
a
woman
committed
adultery
her
husband
had
a
right
to
beat
her
this
was
one
of
three
cases
when
he
could
do
so
without
incurring
a
penalty
but
after
that
he
could
not
demand
any
other
satisfaction
for
the
same
crime
shall
either
be
atoned
for
or
avenged
but
not
both
the
reasons
that
entitled
a
woman
to
a
divorce
without
curtailing
her
claims
to
a
fair
settlement
were
of
a
very
diverse
nature
bad
breath
of
the
man
was
sufficient
the
ransom
to
be
paid
to
the
chief
or
king
for
the
right
of
the
first
night
gobr
merch
hence
the
medieval
name
marcheta
french
marquette
plays
a
conspicuous
part
in
the
code
of
laws
the
women
had
the
right
to
vote
in
the
public
meetings
add
to
this
that
similar
conditions
are
vouched
for
in
ireland
that
marriage
on
time
was
also
quite
the
custom
there
and
that
the
women
were
assured
of
liberal
and
well
defined
privileges
in
case
of
divorce
even
to
the
point
of
remuneration
for
domestic
services
that
a
first
wife
existed
by
the
side
of
others
and
that
legal
and
illegal
children
without
distinction
received
a
share
of
their
deceased
parent
property
and
we
have
a
picture
of
the
pairing
family
among
the
celts
the
marriage
laws
of
the
american
indians
seem
strict
in
comparison
to
the
celtic
but
this
is
not
surprising
when
we
remember
that
the
celts
were
still
living
in
group
marriage
at
cesar
time
the
irish
gens
sept
the
tribe
was
called
clainne
clan
is
confirmed
and
described
not
alone
by
the
ancient
law
codes
but
also
by
the
english
jurists
of
the
century
who
were
sent
across
for
the
purpose
of
transforming
the
clan
lands
into
royal
dominions
up
to
this
time
the
soil
had
been
the
collective
property
of
the
gens
or
the
clan
except
where
the
chiefs
had
already
claimed
it
as
their
private
dominion
when
a
gentile
died
and
a
household
was
thus
dissolved
the
gentile
chief
called
caput
cognationis
by
the
english
jurists
made
a
new
assignment
of
the
whole
gentile
territory
to
the
rest
of
the
household
this
division
of
land
probably
took
place
according
to
such
rules
as
were
observed
in
germany
until
about
fifty
years
ago
village
marks
were
quite
frequent
and
some
of
these
rundales
may
be
found
to
this
day
the
farmers
of
a
rundale
individual
tenants
on
the
soil
that
once
was
the
collective
property
of
the
gens
but
had
been
confiscated
by
the
english
conquerors
each
pay
the
rent
for
his
respective
parcel
but
they
all
combine
their
lands
and
parcel
it
off
according
to
situation
and
quality
these
parcels
called
gewanne
on
the
german
river
mosel
are
cultivated
collectively
and
their
yield
is
divided
into
shares
marshland
and
pastures
are
used
in
common
fifty
years
ago
new
divisions
were
still
made
occasionally
sometimes
annually
the
field
map
of
such
a
rundale
village
looks
exactly
like
that
of
a
german
gehöferschaft
farming
commune
on
the
mosel
or
in
the
hochwald
the
gens
also
survives
in
the
factions
the
irish
farmers
often
form
parties
that
seem
to
be
founded
on
absolutely
contradictory
or
senseless
distinctions
quite
incomprehensible
to
englishmen
the
only
purpose
of
these
factions
is
apparently
to
rally
for
the
popular
sport
of
hammering
the
life
out
of
one
another
they
are
artificial
reincarnations
modern
substitutes
for
the
dispersed
gentes
that
demonstrate
the
continuation
of
the
old
gentile
instinct
in
their
own
peculiar
manner
by
the
way
in
some
localities
the
gentiles
are
still
living
together
on
what
is
practically
their
old
territory
during
the
thirties
for
instance
the
great
majority
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
old
county
of
monaghan
had
only
four
family
names
they
were
descended
from
four
gentes
or
tribes
clans
the
downfall
of
the
gentile
order
in
scotland
dates
from
the
suppression
of
the
revolt
in
what
link
of
this
order
the
scotch
clan
represented
remains
to
be
investigated
that
it
is
a
link
is
beyond
doubt
walter
scott
novels
bring
this
scotch
highland
clan
vividly
before
our
eyes
it
is
as
morgan
says
an
excellent
type
of
the
gens
in
organization
and
in
spirit
and
an
extraordinary
illustration
of
the
power
of
the
gentile
life
over
its
members
we
find
in
their
feuds
and
blood
revenge
in
their
localization
by
gentes
in
their
use
of
lands
in
common
in
the
fidelity
of
the
clansman
to
his
chief
and
of
the
members
of
the
clan
to
each
other
the
usual
and
persistent
features
of
gentile
society
descent
was
in
the
male
line
the
children
of
the
males
remaining
members
of
the
clan
while
the
children
of
its
female
members
belonged
to
the
clans
of
their
respective
fathers
the
fact
that
matriarchal
law
was
formerly
in
force
in
scotland
is
proved
by
the
royal
family
of
the
picts
who
according
to
beda
observed
female
lineage
even
a
survival
of
the
punaluan
family
had
been
preserved
among
the
scots
as
among
the
welsh
for
until
the
middle
ages
the
chief
of
the
clan
or
king
the
last
representatives
of
the
former
common
husbands
had
the
right
to
claim
the
first
night
with
every
bride
unless
a
ransom
was
given
it
is
an
indisputable
fact
that
the
germans
were
organized
in
gentes
up
to
the
time
of
the
great
migrations
the
territory
between
the
danube
the
rhine
the
vistula
and
the
northern
seas
was
evidently
occupied
by
them
only
a
few
centuries
before
christ
the
cimbri
and
teutons
were
then
still
in
full
migration
and
the
suebi
did
not
settle
down
until
cesar
time
cesar
expressly
states
that
they
settled
down
in
gentes
and
kins
gentibus
cognatibusque
and
in
the
mouth
of
a
roman
of
the
gens
julia
this
term
gentibus
has
a
definite
meaning
that
no
amount
of
disputation
can
obliterate
this
holds
good
for
all
germans
it
seems
that
even
the
provinces
taken
by
them
from
the
romans
were
settled
by
distribution
to
gentes
the
alemanian
code
of
laws
affirms
that
the
people
settled
in
gentes
genealogiae
on
the
conquered
land
south
of
the
danube
genealogia
is
used
in
exactly
the
same
sense
as
was
later
on
mark
or
dorfgenossenschaft
mark
or
village
community
kovalevsky
recently
maintained
that
these
genealogiae
were
the
great
household
communities
among
which
the
land
was
divided
and
from
which
the
village
communities
developed
later
on
the
same
may
be
true
of
the
fara
by
which
term
the
burgundians
and
langobards
a
gothic
and
a
herminonian
or
high
german
tribe
designated
nearly
if
not
exactly
the
same
thing
as
the
alemanian
genealogiae
whether
this
is
really
the
gens
or
the
household
community
must
be
settled
by
further
investigation
the
language
records
leave
us
in
doubt
whether
all
the
germans
had
a
common
expression
for
gens
or
not
and
as
to
what
this
term
was
etymologically
the
gothic
kuni
middle
high
german
künne
corresponds
to
the
grecian
genos
and
the
latin
gens
and
is
used
in
the
same
sense
we
are
led
back
to
the
time
of
matriarchy
by
the
terms
for
woman
which
are
derived
from
the
same
root
greek
gynê
slav
zenâ
gothic
qvino
norse
kona
kuna
among
langobards
and
burgundians
i
repeat
we
find
the
term
fara
which
grimm
derives
from
the
hypothetical
root
fisan
to
beget
i
should
prefer
to
trace
it
to
the
more
obvious
root
faran
german
fahren
to
ride
or
to
wander
in
order
to
designate
a
certain
well
defined
section
of
the
wandering
corps
composed
quite
naturally
of
relatives
as
a
result
of
centuries
of
wanderings
from
west
to
east
and
back
again
this
term
was
gradually
applied
to
the
sex
group
itself
there
is
furthermore
the
gothic
sibja
anglosaxon
sib
old
high
german
sippia
sippa
high
german
sippe
old
norse
has
only
the
plural
sifjar
the
relatives
the
singular
occurs
only
as
the
name
of
a
goddess
sif
finally
another
expression
occurs
in
the
hildebrand
song
where
hildebrand
asks
hadubrand
who
is
your
father
among
the
men
of
the
nation
or
what
is
your
kin
eddo
huêllihhes
cnuosles
du
sîs
if
there
was
a
common
german
term
for
gens
it
was
presumably
the
gothic
kuni
this
is
not
only
indicated
by
its
identity
with
the
corresponding
term
in
related
languages
but
also
by
the
fact
that
the
word
kuning
german
könig
english
king
is
derived
from
it
all
of
which
originally
signified
chief
of
gens
or
tribe
sibja
german
sippe
relationship
does
not
appear
worthy
of
consideration
in
old
norse
at
least
sifjar
signifies
not
alone
kin
by
blood
but
also
kin
through
marriage
hence
it
comprises
the
members
of
at
least
two
gentes
and
the
term
sif
can
not
have
been
applied
to
the
gens
itself
in
the
order
of
battle
the
germans
like
the
mexicans
and
greeks
arranged
the
horsemen
as
well
as
the
columns
of
the
troops
on
foot
by
gentes
tacitus
indefinite
expression
by
families
and
kinships
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
at
his
time
the
gens
had
long
ceased
to
be
a
living
body
in
rome
another
passage
of
tacitus
is
decisive
there
he
says
the
brother
regards
his
nephew
as
his
son
some
even
hold
that
the
bond
of
blood
between
the
maternal
uncle
and
the
nephew
is
more
sacred
and
close
than
that
between
father
and
son
so
that
when
persons
are
demanded
as
securities
the
sister
son
is
considered
a
better
security
than
the
natural
son
of
the
man
whom
they
desire
to
place
under
bonds
here
we
have
a
living
proof
of
the
matriarchal
and
hence
natural
gens
and
it
is
described
as
a
characteristic
mark
of
the
germans
if
a
member
of
such
a
gens
gave
his
own
son
as
a
security
for
the
fulfillment
of
a
vow
and
this
son
became
the
victim
of
his
father
breach
of
faith
that
was
the
concern
of
the
father
alone
but
when
the
son
of
a
sister
was
sacrificed
then
the
most
sacred
gentile
law
was
violated
the
next
relative
who
was
bound
above
all
others
to
protect
the
boy
or
young
man
was
held
responsible
for
his
death
either
he
should
not
have
given
the
boy
in
bail
or
he
should
have
kept
the
contract
if
we
had
no
other
trace
of
gentile
law
among
the
germans
this
one
passage
would
be
sufficient
proof
of
its
existence
but
there
is
another
passage
in
the
old
norse
song
of
the
dawn
of
the
gods
and
the
end
of
the
world
the
völuspâ
which
is
still
stronger
evidence
because
it
is
years
younger
in
this
vision
of
the
seeress
in
which
bang
and
bugge
have
now
demonstrated
the
existence
of
christian
elements
also
the
description
of
the
time
of
general
degeneration
and
corruption
inaugurating
the
great
catastrophe
contains
this
passage

murderers

the

systrungr
means
the
son
of
the
mother
sister
and
an
abnegation
of
the
blood
kinship
from
that
side
surpasses
in
the
eyes
of
the
poet
even
the
crime
of
fratricide
there
is
a
deliberate
climax
in
that
systrungar
emphasizing
the
maternal
kinship
if
the
term
and
sister
children
or
brother
and
sister
sons
had
been
used
there
would
have
been
a
weakening
of
the
effect
instead
of
a
climax
that
shows
that
even
at
the
time
of
the
vikings
when
the
völuspâ
was
composed
the
recollection
of
maternal
law
was
not
yet
blotted
out
among
the
germans
with
whom
tacitus
was
familiar
maternal
law
had
already
given
way
to
paternal
lineage
the
children
were
the
next
heirs
of
the
father
in
the
absence
of
children
the
brothers
and
uncles
on
both
sides
were
next
in
line
the
admission
of
the
mother
brother
to
the
inheritance
is
a
relic
of
maternal
law
and
proves
that
paternal
law
had
only
recently
been
introduced
by
the
germans
traces
of
maternal
law
were
preserved
until
late
in
the
middle
ages
it
seems
that
even
at
this
late
date
people
still
felt
certain
misgivings
about
the
reliability
of
fatherhood
especially
among
serfs
for
when
a
feudal
lord
demanded
the
return
of
a
fugitive
serf
from
a
city
it
was
first
required
for
instance
in
augsburg
basel
and
kaiserslautern
that
the
fact
of
his
serfdom
should
be
established
by
the
oaths
of
six
of
his
next
blood
relations
all
of
whom
had
to
belong
to
his

kin

another
relic
of
declining
matriarchy
was
the
from
the
roman
standpoint
almost
inexplicable
respect
of
the
germans
for
the
female
sex
young
girls
of
noble
family
were
considered
the
safest
bonds
to
secure
the
keeping
of
contracts
with
germans
in
battle
nothing
stimulated
their
courage
so
much
as
the
horrible
thought
that
their
wives
and
daughters
might
be
captured
and
carried
into
slavery
a
woman
was
to
them
something
holy
and
prophetical
and
they
listened
to
her
advice
in
the
most
important
matters
veleda
the
bructerian
priestess
on
the
river
lippe
was
the
soul
of
the
insurrection
of
the
batavians
in
which
civilis
at
the
head
of
german
and
belgian
tribes
shook
the
foundations
of
roman
rule
in
gaul
the
women
held
undisputed
sway
in
the
house
if
we
may
believe
tacitus
they
together
with
the
old
men
and
children
had
to
do
all
the
work
for
the
men
went
hunting
drank
and
loafed
but
as
tacitus
does
not
say
who
cultivated
the
fields
and
as
according
to
his
explicit
statement
the
slaves
paid
only
tithes
but
did
not
work
under
compulsion
it
seems
that
the
adult
men
would
have
had
to
do
what
little
agricultural
work
was
required
the
form
of
marriage
as
stated
above
was
the
pairing
family
in
gradual
transition
to
monogamy
it
was
not
yet
strict
monogamy
for
polygamy
was
permitted
for
the
wealthy
chasteness
of
the
girls
was
in
general
carefully
maintained
different
from
the
custom
of
the
celts
tacitus
speaks
with
special
ardor
of
the
sacredness
of
the
matrimonial
bond
among
the
germans
adultery
of
the
woman
is
alone
quoted
by
him
as
a
reason
for
a
divorce
but
his
treatment
of
this
subject
leaves
many
a
flaw
and
besides
it
too
openly
holds
up
the
mirror
of
virtue
to
the
dissipated
romans
so
much
is
certain
granted
that
the
germans
were
such
exceptional
models
of
virtue
in
their
forests
it
required
only
a
short
contact
with
the
outer
world
to
bring
them
down
to
the
level
of
the
other
average
europeans
in
the
whirl
of
roman
life
the
last
trace
of
pure
morals
disappeared
even
faster
than
the
german
language
just
read
gregorius
of
tours
it
is
obvious
that
in
the
primeval
forests
of
germany
no
such
voluptuousness
could
exist
as
in
rome
that
implies
fully
enough
superiority
of
the
germans
over
the
roman
world
and
there
is
no
necessity
for
ascribing
to
them
a
moderation
and
chastity
that
have
never
been
the
qualities
of
any
nation
as
a
whole
a
result
of
gentile
law
is
the
obligation
to
inherit
the
enmities
as
well
as
the
friendships
of
one
father
and
relatives
so
is
furthermore
the
displacement
of
blood
revenge
by
the
wergeld
a
fine
to
be
paid
in
atonement
of
manslaughter
and
injuries
a
generation
ago
this
wergeld
was
considered
a
specifically
german
institution
but
it
has
since
been
found
that
hundreds
of
nations
introduced
this
mitigation
of
gentile
blood
revenge
like
the
obligatory
hospitality
it
is
found
for
instance
among
the
american
indians
tacitus
description
of
the
manner
in
which
hospitality
was
observed
germania
chapt
is
almost
identical
with
morgan
the
hot
and
ceaseless
controversy
as
to
whether
or
not
the
germans
had
already
made
a
definite
repartition
of
the
cultivated
land
at
time
and
how
the
passages
relating
to
this
question
should
be
interpreted
is
now
a
thing
of
the
past
after
the
following
facts
had
been
established
that
the
cultivated
land
of
nearly
all
nations
was
tilled
collectively
by
the
gens
and
later
on
by
communistic
family
groups
a
practice
which
cesar
still
found
among
the
suebi
that
as
a
result
of
this
practice
the
land
was
periodically
and
that
this
periodical
repartition
of
the
cultivated
land
was
preserved
in
germany
down
to
our
days
after
such
evidence
we
need
not
waste
any
more
breath
on
the
subject
a
transition
within
years
from
collective
cultivation
such
as
cesar
expressly
attributes
to
the
suebi
to
individual
cultivation
with
annual
repartition
of
the
soil
such
as
tacitus
found
among
the
germans
is
surely
progress
enough
for
any
one
the
further
transition
from
this
stage
to
complete
private
ownership
of
land
during
such
a
short
period
and
without
any
external
intervention
would
involve
an
absolute
impossibility
hence
i
can
only
read
in
tacitus
what
he
states
in
so
many
words
they
change
or
the
cultivated
land
every
year
and
enough
land
is
left
for
common
use
it
is
the
stage
of
agriculture
and
appropriation
of
the
soil
which
exactly
tallies
with
the
contemporaneous
gentile
constitution
of
the
germans
i
leave
the
preceding
paragraph
unchanged
just
as
it
stood
in
former
editions
meantime
the
question
has
assumed
another
aspect
since
kovalevsky
has
demonstrated
that
the
patriarchal
household
community
existed
nearly
everywhere
perhaps
even
everywhere
as
the
connecting
link
between
the
matriarchal
communistic
and
the
modern
isolated
family
the
question
is
no
longer
collective
property
or
private
property
as
discussed
between
maurer
and
waitz
but
what
was
the
form
of
that
collective
property
not
alone
is
there
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
suebi
were
the
collective
owners
of
their
land
at
cesar
time
but
also
that
they
tilled
the
soil
collectively
the
questions
whether
their
economic
unit
was
the
gens
or
the
household
or
an
intermediate
communistic
group
or
whether
all
three
of
these
groups
existed
at
the
same
time
as
a
result
of
different
local
conditions
may
remain
undecided
for
a
long
while
yet
kovalevsky
maintains
that
the
conditions
described
by
tacitus
were
not
founded
on
the
mark
or
village
community
but
on
the
household
community
which
developed
much
later
into
the
village
community
by
the
growth
of
the
population
hence
the
settlements
of
the
germans
on
the
territory
they
occupied
at
the
time
of
the
romans
and
on
territory
later
taken
by
them
from
the
romans
would
not
have
consisted
of
villages
but
of
large
families
comprising
several
generations
who
cultivated
a
sufficient
piece
of
land
and
used
the
surrounding
wild
land
in
common
with
their
neighbors
if
this
was
the
case
then
the
passage
in
tacitus
regarding
the
changing
of
the
cultivated
land
would
indeed
have
an
agronomic
meaning
that
the
household
cultivated
a
different
piece
of
land
every
year
and
the
land
cultivated
during
the
previous
year
was
left
untilled
or
entirely
abandoned
the
scarcity
of
the
population
would
have
left
enough
spare
wild
lands
to
make
all
dispute
about
land
unnecessary
only
after
the
lapse
of
centuries
when
the
members
of
the
family
had
increased
so
that
the
collective
cultivation
became
incompatible
with
the
prevailing
conditions
of
production
the
household
communities
were
dissolved
the
former
common
fields
and
meadows
were
then
divided
in
the
manner
among
the
various
individual
families
that
had
now
formed
the
division
of
farm
lands
was
first
periodical
but
later
final
while
forest
pasture
and
watercourses
remained
common
property
it
seems
that
this
process
of
development
has
been
fully
established
for
russia
by
historical
investigation
as
for
germany
and
in
the
second
place
for
other
german
countries
it
can
not
be
denied
that
this
view
affords
in
many
instances
a
better
interpretation
of
historical
authorities
and
a
readier
solution
of
difficulties
than
the
idea
of
tracing
the
village
community
to
the
time
of
tacitus
the
oldest
documents
of
the
codex
laureshamensis
are
easier
explained
by
the
help
of
the
household
than
of
the
village
community
on
the
other
hand
new
difficulties
now
arise
and
new
questions
pose
themselves
it
will
require
further
investigations
to
arrive
at
definite
conclusions
however
i
can
not
deny
that
the
probability
is
very
much
in
favor
of
the
intermediate
stage
of
the
household
community
while
the
germans
of
cesar
time
had
either
just
taken
up
settled
abodes
or
were
still
looking
for
them
they
had
been
settled
for
a
full
century
at
the
time
of
tacitus
as
a
result
there
is
a
manifest
progress
in
the
production
of
necessities
the
germans
lived
in
block
houses
their
clothing
was
still
as
primitive
as
their
forests
consisting
of
rough
woolen
cloaks
animal
skins
and
linen
underclothing
for
the
women
and
the
wealthy
they
lived
on
milk
meat
wild
fruit
and
as
pliny
adds
oatmeal
porridge
which
is
the
celtic
national
dish
in
ireland
and
scotland
their
wealth
consisted
in
cattle
of
an
inferior
race
the
kine
were
small
of
unattractive
appearance
and
without
horns
the
horses
little
ponies
were
not
fast
runners
money
roman
coin
only
was
rarely
used
they
did
not
make
ornaments
of
gold
and
silver
nor
did
they
value
these
metals
iron
was
scarce
and
at
least
among
the
tribes
on
the
rhine
and
the
danube
was
apparently
only
imported
not
mined
by
themselves
the
runen
script
imitations
of
greek
and
latin
letters
was
only
used
as
a
cipher
and
exclusively
for
religious
sorcery
human
sacrifices
were
still
in
vogue
in
short
they
were
a
nation
just
emerged
out
of
the
middle
stage
of
barbarism
into
the
upper
stage
but
while
the
tribes
whose
immediate
contact
with
the
romans
facilitated
the
import
of
roman
products
were
thereby
prevented
from
acquiring
a
metal
and
textile
industry
of
their
own
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
that
the
tribes
of
the
northeast
on
the
baltic
developed
these
industries
the
pieces
of
armor
found
in
the
bogs
of
sleswick
a
long
iron
sword
a
coat
of
mail
a
silver
helmet
together
with
roman
coins
from
the
close
of
the
second
century
and
the
german
metal
ware
spread
by
the
migrations
represent
a
peculiar
type
of
a
superior
finish
even
such
as
were
modeled
after
roman
originals
with
the
exception
of
england
the
emigration
into
the
civilized
roman
empire
everywhere
put
an
end
to
this
home
industry
how
simultaneously
this
industry
arose
and
developed
is
shown
by
the
bronze
spangles
the
specimens
found
in
burgundy
in
roumania
and
on
the
sea
of
asow
might
have
been
manufactured
in
the
same
shop
with
those
found
in
england
or
sweden
and
are
of
undoubted
german
origin
the
german
constitution
was
also
in
keeping
with
the
upper
stage
of
barbarism
according
to
tacitus
the
council
of
chiefs
principes
universally
decided
matters
of
minor
importance
and
prepared
important
matters
for
the
decision
of
the
public
meetings
so
far
as
we
know
anything
of
the
public
meeting
in
the
lower
stage
of
barbarism
among
the
american
indians
it
was
only
held
by
gentes
not
by
tribes
or
leagues
of
tribes
the
chiefs
of
peace
principes
were
still
sharply
distinguished
from
the
chiefs
of
war
duces
just
as
among
the
iroquois
the
peace
chiefs
were
already
living
in
part
on
honorary
donations
of
the
gentiles
such
as
cattle
grain
etc
they
were
generally
elected
from
the
same
family
analogous
to
america
the
transition
to
paternal
law
favored
as
in
greece
and
rome
the
gradual
transformation
of
office
by
election
into
hereditary
office
a
noble
family
was
thus
gradually
raised
in
each
gens
most
of
this
hereditary
nobility
came
to
grief
during
the
migrations
or
shortly
after
the
military
leaders
were
elected
solely
on
their
merits
they
had
little
power
and
were
obliged
to
rely
on
the
force
of
their
example
the
actual
disciplinary
power
in
the
army
was
held
by
the
priests
as
tacitus
implicitly
states
the
public
meeting
was
the
real
executive
the
king
or
chief
of
the
tribe
presided
the
people
decided
a
murmur
signified
no
acclamation
and
clanging
of
weapons
meant
yes
the
public
meeting
was
at
the
same
time
a
court
of
justice
complaints
were
here
brought
forth
and
decided
and
death
sentences
pronounced
only
cowardice
treason
and
unnatural
lust
were
capital
crimes
the
gentes
and
other
subdivisions
decided
in
a
body
under
the
chairmanship
of
the
chief
who
in
all
original
german
courts
was
only
the
manager
of
the
transactions
and
questioner
among
germans
the
sentence
has
ever
and
everywhere
been
pronounced
by
the
community
leagues
of
tribes
came
into
existence
since
cesar
time
some
of
them
already
had
kings
the
first
chief
of
war
began
to
covet
the
place
as
among
greeks
and
romans
and
sometimes
succeeded
in
obtaining
it
such
successful
usurpers
were
by
no
means
absolute
rulers
but
still
they
began
to
break
through
the
bonds
of
the
gens
while
freed
slaves
generally
occupied
an
inferior
position
because
they
could
not
be
members
of
any
gens
they
often
gained
rank
wealth
and
honors
as
favorites
of
the
new
kings
the
same
thing
took
place
after
the
conquest
of
the
roman
empire
by
those
military
leaders
who
had
now
become
kings
of
great
countries
among
the
frankons
slaves
and
freed
slaves
of
the
king
played
a
leading
role
first
at
the
court
then
in
the
state
a
large
part
of
the
new
nobility
were
descended
from
them
there
was
one
institution
that
especially
favored
the
rise
of
royalty
the
military
following
we
have
already
seen
how
among
the
american
redskins
private
war
groups
were
formed
independently
of
the
gens
among
the
germans
these
private
groups
had
developed
into
standing
bodies
the
military
leader
who
had
acquired
fame
gathered
around
his
person
a
host
of
booty
loving
young
warriors
they
were
pledged
to
personal
faithfulness
by
their
leader
who
in
return
pledged
himself
to
them
he
fed
them
gave
them
presents
and
organized
them
on
hierarchic
principles
a

these

must
have
been
rather
insignificant
in
fact
we
find
them
so
later
under
odoaker
in
italy
still
they
portended
the
decay
of
the
old
gentile
liberty
and
the
events
during
and
after

proved
that

were

that
they

together
by
continual
warfare
and

robbery
became
their

purpose
if
the
leader
found
nothing
to
do
in
his
neighborhood
he
marched
his

to
other
countries
where
a
prospect
of

and
booty
allured
him
the
german
auxiliaries
many
of
whom
fought
under
the
roman
standard
even
against
germans
had
been
largely
recruited
among
such
followings
they
represent
the
first
germs
of
the
landsknecht
profession
the
shame
and
curse
of
the
germans
after
the
conquest
of
the
roman
empire
these
retainers
of
kings
together
with
the
unfree
roman
courtiers
formed
the
other
half
of
the
nobility
of
later
days
in
general
then
the
german
tribes
combined
into
nations
had
the
same
constitution
that
had
developed
among
the
greeks
of
the
heroic
era
and
the
romans
at
the
time
of
the
kings
public
meetings
councils
of
gentile
chiefs
and
military
leaders
who
coveted
actual
royal
power
it
was
the
highest
constitution
which
the
gentile
order
could
produce
it
was
the
standard
constitution
of
the
higher
stage
of
barbarism
if
society
passed
the
limits
for
which
this
constitution
sufficed
then
the
end
of
the
gentile
order
had
come
it
collapsed

the
state
took
its
place

note
to
the
fourth
edition
during
a
few
days
passed
in
ireland
i
once
more
became
conscious
to
what
extent
the
rural
population
is
still
living
in
the
conceptions
of
the
gentile
period
the
great
landholder
whose
tenant
the
farmer
is
still
enjoys
a
position
similar
to
that
of
a
clan
chief
who
has
to
supervise
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
in
the
interest
of
all
who
is
entitled
to
a
tribute
from
the
farmer
in
the
form
of
rent
but
who
also
has
to
assist
the
farmer
in
cases
of
need
likewise
everyone
in
comfortable
circumstances
is
considered
under
obligation
to
help
his
poorer
neighbors
whenever
they
are
in
need
such
assistance
is
not
charity
it
is
simply
the
prerogative
of
the
poor
gentile
which
the
rich
gentile
or
the
chief
of
the
clan
must
respect
this
explains
why
the
professors
of
political
economy
and
the
jurists
complain
of
the
impossibility
of
imparting
the
idea
of
the
modern
private
property
to
the
irish
farmers
property
that
has
only
rights
but
no
duties
is
absolutely
beyond
the
ken
of
the
irishman
no
wonder
that
so
many

suddenly
cast
into

of
the
modern
great

of

chapter

the
rise
of
the
state
among
germans
according
to
tacitus
the
german
nation
was
very
strong
in
numbers
an
approximate
idea
of
the
strength
of
individual
german
nations
is
given
by
caesar
he
states
that
the
number
of
usipetans
and
tencterans
who
crossed
over
to
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
amounted
to
including
women
and
children
about
members
to
a
single
nation
is
considerably
more
than
the
iroquois
numbered
in
their
prime
when
of
them
became
the
terror
of
the
whole
country
from
the
great
lakes
to
the
ohio
and
potomac
if
we
attempt
to
place
the
better
known
nations
of
the
rhine
country
by
the
help
of
historical
reports
we
find
that
a
single
nation
occupies
on
the
map
the
average
area
of
a
prussian
government
district
about
square
kilometers
or
german
geographical
square
miles
the
germania
magna
of
the
romans
reaching
to
the
vistula
comprised
about
square
kilometers
counting
an
average
of
for
any
single
nation
the
total
population
of
germania
magna
would
have
amounted
to
five
millions
this
is
a
rather
high
figure
for
a
barbarian
group
of
nations
although
inhabitants
to
the
square
kilometer
or
to
the
geographical
square
mile
is
very
little
when
compared
to
present
conditions
but
this
does
not
include
the
whole
number
of
germans
then
living
we
know
that
german
nations
of
the
gothic
race
bastarnians
peukinians
and
others
lived
all
along
the
carpathian
mountains
away
down
to
the
mouth
of
the
danube
they
were
so
numerous
that
pliny
designated
them
as
the
fifth
main
division
of
the
germans
as
much
as
years
they
were
mercenaries
of
the
macedonian
king
perseus
and
during
the
first
years
of
augustus
they
were
still
pushing
their
way
as
far
as
the
vicinity
of
adrianople
assuming
them
to
have
been
one
million
strong
we
find
that
at
least
six
millions
was
the
probable
population
of
germany
at
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
after
the
final
settlement
in
germany
the
population
must
have
grown
with
increasing
rapidity
the
industrial
progress
mentioned
above
would
be
sufficient
to
prove
it
the
objects
found
in
the
bogs
of
sleswick
to
judge
by
the
roman
coins
found
with
them
are
from
the
third
century
hence
at
that
time
the
metal
and
textile
industry
was
already
well
developed
on
the
baltic
a
lively
traffic
with
the
roman
empire
was
carried
on
and
the
wealthier
class
enjoyed
a
certain
luxury
all
of
which
indicates
that
the
population
had
increased
but
at
the
same
time
the
general
war
of
aggression
against
the
romans
commenced
along
the
whole
line
of
the
rhine
of
the
roman
wall
and
of
the
danube
a
line
stretching
from
the
north
sea
to
the
black
sea
this
is
another
proof
of
the
ever
growing
outward
pressure
of
the
population
during
the
struggle
which
lasted
three
centuries
the
whole
main
body
of
the
gothic
nations
with
the
exception
of
the
scandinavian
goths
and
the
burgundians
marched
to
the
southeast
and
formed
the
left
wing
of
the
long
line
of
attack
the
high
germans
herminonians
on
the
upper
danube
fought
in
the
center
and
the
iskaevonians
on
the
rhine
now
called
franks
advanced
on
the
right
wing
the
conquest
of
brittany
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
ingaevonians
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
century
the
exhausted
bloodless
and
helpless
roman
empire
lay
open
to
the
germans
in
former
chapters
we
stood
at
the
cradle
of
antique
greek
and
roman
civilization
now
we
are
standing
at
its
grave
the
equalizing
plane
of
roman
world
power
had
been
gliding
for
centuries
over
all
the
mediterranean
countries
where
the
greek
language
did
not
offer
any
resistance
all
national
idioms
had
been
crushed
by
a
corrupted
latin
there
were
no
longer
any
distinctions
of
nationality
no
more
gauls
iberians
ligurians
noricans
they
had
all
become
romans
roman
administration
and
roman
law
had
everywhere
dissolved
the
old
gentile
bodies
and
thus
crushed
the
last
remnant
of
local
and
national
independence
the
new
type
of
romans
offered
no
compensation
for
this
loss
for
it
did
not
express
any
nationality
but
only
the
lack
of
a
nationality
the
elements
for
the
formation
of
new
nations
were
present
everywhere
the
latin
dialects
of
the
different
provinces
differentiated
more
and
more
but
the
natural
boundaries
that
had
once
made
italy
gaul
spain
africa
independent
territories
were
still
present
and
made
themselves
felt
yet
there
was
no
strength
anywhere
for
combining
these
elements
into
new
nations
nowhere
was
there
the
least
trace
of
any
capacity
for
development
nor
any
power
of
resistance
much
less
any
creative
power
the
immense
human
throng
of
that
enormous
territory
was
held
together
by
one
bond
alone
the
roman
state
but
this
state
had
in
time
become
the
worst
enemy
and
oppressor
of
its
subjects
the
provinces
had
ruined
rome
it
had
become
a
provincial
town
like
all
others
privileged
but
no
longer
ruling
no
longer
the
center
of
the
world
empire
no
longer
even
the
seat
of
the
emperors
and
subregents
who
lived
in
constantinople
treves
and
milan
the
roman
state
had
become
an
immense
complicated
machine
designed
exclusively
for
the
exploitation
of
its
subjects
taxes
state
imposts
and
tithes
of
all
sorts
drove
the
mass
of
the
people
deeper
and
deeper
into
poverty
by
the
blackmailing
practices
of
the
regents
tax
collectors
and
soldiers
the
pressure
was
increased
to
such
a
point
that
it
became
insupportable
this
was
the
outcome
of
rome
world
power
the
right
of
the
state
to
existence
was
founded
on
the
preservation
of
order
in
the
interior
and
the
protection
against
the
barbarians
outside
but
this
order
was
worse
than
the
most
disgusting
disorder
and
the
barbarians
against
whom
the
state
pretended
to
protect
its
citizens
were
hailed
by
them
as
saviors
the
condition
of
society
was
no
less
desperate
during
the
last
years
of
the
republic
the
roman
rulers
had
already
contrived
the
pitiless
exploitation
of
the
conquered
provinces
the
emperors
had
not
abolished
but
organized
this
exploitation
the
more
the
empire
fell
to
pieces
the
higher
rose
the
taxes
and
tithes
and
the
more
shamelessly
did
the
officials
rob
and
blackmail
commerce
and
industry
had
never
been
a
strong
point
of
the
domineering
romans
only
in
usury
they
had
excelled
all
other
nations
before
and
after
them
what
commerce
had
managed
to
exist
had
been
ruined
by
official
extortion
only
in
the
east
in
the
grecian
part
of
the
empire
some
commerce
still
vegetated
but
this
is
outside
of
the
scope
of
our
study
universal
reduction
to
poverty
decrease
of
traffic
of
handicrafts
of

of
population
decay
of
the
towns
return
of
agriculture
to
a
lower
stage
that
had
been
the
final
result
of
roman
world
supremacy
but
now
agriculture
the
most
prominent
branch
of
production
in
the
whole
old
world
was
again
supreme
and
more
than
ever
in
italy
the
immense
estates
latifundiae
that
comprised
nearly
the
whole
country
since
the
end
of
the
republic
had
been
utilized
in
two
ways
either
as
pastures
on
which
the
population
had
been
replaced
by
sheep
and
oxen
the
care
of
which
required
only
a
few
slaves
or
as
country
seats
on
which
masses
of
slaves
carried
on
horticulture
on
a
large
scale
partly
for
the
luxury
of
the
owner
partly
for
sale
on
the
markets
of
the
towns
the
great
pastures
had
been
preserved
and
even
extended
in
certain
parts
but
the
country
seats
and
their
horticulture
had
gone
to
ruin
through
the
impoverishment
of
their
owners
and
the
decay
of
the
towns
latifundian
economy
based
on
slave
labor
was
no
longer
profitable
but
in
its
time
it
had
been
the
only
possible
form
of
agriculture
on
a
large
scale
now
however
small
production
had
again
become
the
only
lucrative
form
one
country
seat
after
the
other
was
parceled
and
leased
in
small
lots
to
hereditary
tenants
who
paid
a
fixed
rent
or
to
partiarii
more
administrators
than
tenants
who
received
or
even
only
of
a
year
product
in
remuneration
for
their
work
but
these
little
lots
were
principally
disposed
of
to
colonists
who
paid
a
fixed
sum
annually
and
could
be
transferred
by
sale
together
with
their
lots
although
no
slaves
still
these
colonists
were
not
free
they
could
not
marry
free
citizens
and
marriages
with
members
of
their
own
class
were
not
regarded
as
valid
but
as
mere
concubinages
like
those
of
the
slaves
the
colonists
were
the
prototypes
of
the
medieval
serfs
the
ancient
slavery
had
lost
its
vitality
neither
in
the
country
in
large
scale
agriculture
nor
in
the
manufactories
of
the
towns
did
it
yield
any
more
returns
the
market
for
its
products
had
disappeared
and
small
scale
production
and
artisanship
to
which
the
gigantic
production
of
the
flourishing
time
of
the
empire
was
now
reduced
did
not
leave
any
room
for
numerous
slaves
only
house
and
luxury
slaves
of
the
rich
were
still
retained
by
society
but
this
declining
slavery
was
as
yet
sufficiently
strong
to
brand
productive
labor
as
slave
work
as
below
the
dignity
of
free
romans
and
everybody
was
now
a
free
roman
an
increasing
number
of
superfluous
slaves
who
had
become
a
drug
on
their
owners
were
dismissed
while
on
the
other
hand
the
number
of
colonists
and
of
beggared
free
men
similar
to
the
poor
whites
in
the
slave
states
of
america
grew
continuously
christianity
is
perfectly
innocent
of
this
gradual
decline
of
ancient
slavery
for
it
had
taken
part
in
the
slavery
of
the
roman
empire
for
centuries
it
never
prevented
the
slave
trade
of
christians
later
on
neither
of
the
germans
in
the
north
nor
of
the
venetians
on
the
mediterranean
nor
the
negro
traffic
of
later
years
slavery
died
because
it
did
not
pay
any
longer
but
it
left
behind
its
poisonous
sting
by
branding
as
ignoble
the
productive
labor
of
free
men
this
brought
the
roman
world
into
a
closed
alley
from
which
it
could
not
escape
slave
labor
was
economically
impossible
and
the
labor
of
free
men
was
under
a
moral
ban
the
one
could
exist
no
longer
the
other
could
not
yet
be
the
fundamental
form
of
social
production
there
was
no
other
help
but
a
complete
revolution
the
provinces
were
not
any
better
off
the
most
complete
reports
on
this
subject
are
from
gaul
by
the
side
of
the
colonists
free
farmers
still
existed
there
in
order
to
protect
themselves
against
the
brutal
blackmail
of
the
officials
judges
and
usurers
they
frequently
placed
themselves
under
the
protectorate
of
a
man
of
influence
and
power
not
only
single
individuals
did
so
but
whole
communities
so
that
the
emperors
of
the
fourth
century
often
issued
decrees
prohibiting
this
practice
but
what
good
did
protection
do
to
the
clients
the
patron
imposed
the
condition
that
they
should
transfer
the
title
of
their
lots
to
him
and
in
return
he
assured
them
of
the
free
enjoyment
of
their
land
for
life
a
trick
which
the
holy
church
remembered
and
freely
imitated
during
the
ninth
and
tenth
century
for
the
greater
glory
of
god
in
the
fifth
century
however
about
the
year
bishop
salvianus
of
marseilles
still
vehemently
denounced
such
robbery
and
relates
that
the
methods
of
the
roman
officials
and
great
landlords
became
so
oppressive
that
many
romans
fled
to
the
districts
occupied
by
the
barbarians
and
feared
nothing
so
much
as
a
return
under
roman
rule
that
poor
parents
frequently
sold
their
children
into
slavery
is
proved
by
a
law
forbidding
this
practice
in
return
for
liberating
the
romans
from
their
own
state
the
barbarians
appropriated
of
the
entire
land
and
divided
it
among
themselves
the
distribution
was
made
by
gentile
rules
as
the
number
of
the
conquerors
was
relatively
small
large
tracts
remained
undivided
in
the
possession
of
the
nation
the
tribe
or
the
gens
every
gens
distributed
the
land
for
cultivation
and
pastures
to
the
individual
households
by
drawing
lots
we
do
not
know
whether
repeated
divisions
took
place
at
that
time
at
any
rate
this
practice
was
soon
discarded
in
the
roman
provinces
and
the
individual
lot
became
salable
private
property
a
freehold
allodium
forests
and
pastures
remained
undivided
for
collective
use
this
use
and
the
mode
of
cultivating
the
divided
land
was
regulated
by
tradition
and
the
will
of
the
community
the
longer
the
gens
lived
in
its
village
and
the
better
germans
and
romans
became
amalgamated
in
the
course
of
time
the
more
did
the
character
of
kinship
lose
ground
before
territorial
bounds
the
gens
disappeared
in
the
mark
commune
the
members
of
which
however
still
exhibited
traces
of
kinship
in
the
countries
where
mark
communes
were
still
preserved
in
the
north
of
france
in
england
germany
and
scandinavia
the
gentile
constitution
gradually
merged
into
a
local
constitution
and
thus
acquired
the
capacity
of
being
fitted
into
a
state
nevertheless
this
local
constitution
retained
some
of
the
primeval
democratic
character
which
distinguishes
the
whole
gentile
order
and
thus
preserved
a
piece
of
gentilism
even
in
its
enforced
degeneration
of
later
times
this
left
a
weapon
in
the
hands
of
the
oppressed
ready
to
be
wielded
by
them
even
in
the
present
time
the
rapid
loss
of
the
bonds
of
blood
in
the
gens
as
a
result
of
conquest
caused
the
degeneration
of
the
tribal
and
national
organs
of
gentilism
we
know
that
the
rule
over
subjugated
people
does
not
agree
with
the
gentile
constitution
here
we
have
an
opportunity
to
observe
this
on
a
large
scale
the
german
nations
masters
of
the
roman
provinces
had
to
organize
their
conquests
but
they
could
neither
adopt
the
romans
as
a
body
into
their
gentes
nor
rule
them
by
the
help
of
gentile
organs
a
substitute
for
them
had
to
be
placed
at
the
head
of
the
roman
administrative
bodies
that
were
largely
retained
in
local
affairs
and
this
substitute
could
only
be
another
state
hence
the
organs
of
the
gentile
constitution
had
to
become
organs
of
the
state
and
under
the
pressure
of
the
moment
this
took
place
very
rapidly
now
the
first
representative
of
the
conquering
nation
was
the
military
leader
the
internal
and
external
security
of
the
conquered
territory
demanded
that
his
power
should
be
strengthened
the
moment
had
arrived
for
the
transition
from
war
leadership
to
monarchy
and
the
change
took
place
take
the
realm
of
the
franks
the
victorious
salians
had
not
only
come
into
possession
of
the
extensive
roman
state
dominions
but
also
of
all
the
large
tracts
that
had
not
been
assigned
to
the
more
or
less
small
mark
communities
especially
of
all
large
forest
tracts
the
first
thing
which
the
king
of
the
franks
now
a
real
monarch
did
was
to
change
this
national
property
into
royal
property
to
steal
it
from
the
people
and
to
donate
or
give
it
in
lien
to
his
retainers
this
retinue
originally
composed
of
his
personal
war
followers
and
of
the
subcommanders
of
the
army
was
increased
by
romans
romanized
gauls
who
quickly
became
invaluable
to
the
king
through
their
knowledge
of
writing
their
education
and
their
familiarity
with
the
language
and
laws
of
the
country
and
with
the
language
of
latin
literature
but
slaves
serfs
and
freed
slaves
also
became
his
courtiers
from
among
all
these
he
chose
his
favorites
at
first
they
received
donations
of
public
land
and
later
on
these
benefits
were
generally
conferred
for
the
lifetime
of
the
king
the
foundation
of
a
new
nobility
was
thus
laid
at
the
expense
of
the
people
but
this
was
not
all
the
wide
expanse
of
the
empire
could
not
be
governed
by
means
of
the
old
gentile
constitution
the
council
of
chiefs
if
it
had
not
become
obsolete
long
ago
could
not
have
held
any
more
meetings
it
was
soon
displaced
by
the
standing
retinue
of
the
king
a
pretense
at
the
old
public
meeting
was
still
kept
up
but
it
also
was
more
and
more
limited
to
the
meeting
of
the
subcommanders
of
the
army
and
the
rising
nobles
just
as
formerly
the
roman
farmers
during
the
last
period
of
the
republic
so
now
the
free
peasants
the
mass
of
the
frank
people
were
exhausted
and
reduced
to
penury
by
continual
civil
feuds
and
wars
of
conquest
they
who
once
had
formed
the
whole
army
and
after
the
conquest
of
france
its
picked
body
were
so
impoverished
at
the
end
of
the
ninth
century
that
hardly
more
than
every
fifth
man
could
go
to
war
the
former
army
of
free
peasants
convoked
directly
by
the
king
was
replaced
by
an
army
composed
of
dependents
of
the
new
nobles
among
these
servants
were
also
villeins
the
descendants
of
the
peasants
who
had
acknowledged
no
master
but
the
king
and
a
little
earlier
not
even
a
king
under
charlemagne
successors
the
ruin
of
the
frank
peasantry
was
aggravated
by
internal
wars
weakness
of
the
royal
power
and
corresponding
overbearance
of
the
nobles
the
latter
had
received
another
addition
to
their
ranks
through
the
installation
by
charlemagne
of
gau
district
counts
who
strove
to
make
their
offices
hereditary
the
invasions
of
the
normans
completed
the
wreck
of
the
peasantry
fifty
years
after
the
death
of
charlemagne
france
lay
as
resistless
at
the
feet
of
the
normans
as
four
hundred
years
previous
the
roman
empire
had
lain
at
the
feet
of
the
franks
not
only
was
the
external
impotence
almost
the
same
but
also
the
internal
order
or
rather
disorder
of
society
the
free
frank
peasants
found
themselves
in
a
similar
position
as
their
predecessors
the
roman
colonists
ruined
by
wars
and
robberies
they
had
been
forced
to
seek
the
protection
of
the
nobles
or
the
church
because
the
royal
power
was
too
weak
to
shield
them
but
they
had
to
pay
dearly
for
this
protection
like
the
gallic
farmers
they
had
to
transfer
the
titles
of
their
land
to
their
patrons
and
received
it
back
from
them
as
tenants
in
different
and
varying
forms
but
always
only
in
consideration
of
services
and
tithes
once
driven
into
this
form
of
dependence
they
gradually
lost
their
individual
liberty
after
a
few
generations
most
of
them
became
serfs
how
rapidly
the
free
peasants
sank
from
their
level
is
shown
by
the
land
records
of
the
abbey
saint
germain
des
prés
then
near
now
in
paris
on
the
vast
holdings
of
this
abbey
in
the
surrounding
country
households
nearly
all
of
them
franks
with
german
names
were
living
at
charlemagne
time
of
them
were
colonists
lites
slaves
and
only
freeholders
the
practice
of
the
patrons
to
demand
the
transfer
of
the
land
titles
to
themselves
and
give
the
former
owners
the
use
of
the
land
for
life
denounced
as
ungodly
by
salvianus
was
now
universally
practiced
by
the
church
in
its
dealings
with
the
peasants
the
compulsory
labor
that
now
came
more
and
more
into
vogue
had
been
moulded
as
much
after
the
roman
angariae
compulsory
service
for
the
state
as
after
the
services
of
the
german
mark
men
in
bridge
and
road
building
and
other
work
for
common
purposes
by
all
appearances
then
the
mass
of
the
population
had
arrived
at
the
same
old
goal
after
four
hundred
years
that
proved
two
things
firstly
that
the
social
differentiation
and
the
division
of
property
in
the
sinking
roman
empire
corresponded
perfectly
to
the
contemporaneous
stage
of
production
in
agriculture
and
industry
and
hence
was
unavoidable
secondly
that
this
stage
of
production
had
not
been
essentially
altered
for
better
or
worse
during
four
hundred
years
and
therefore
had
necessarily
produced
the
same
division
of
property
and
the
same
classes
of
population
the
town
had
lost
its
supremacy
over
the
country
during
the
last
centuries
of
the
roman
empire
and
had
not
regained
it
during
the
first
centuries
of
german
rule
this
presupposes
a
low
stage
of
agriculture
and
industry
such
a
general
condition
produces
of
necessity
the
domination
of
great
proprietors
and
the
dependence
of
small
farmers
how
impossible
it
was
to
graft
either
the
slave
labor
of
roman
latifundian
economy
or
the
compulsory
labor
of
the
new
large
scale
production
into
such
a
society
is
proved
by
charlemagne
very
extensive
experiments
with
his
famous
imperial
country
residences
that
left
hardly
a
trace
these
experiments
were
continued
only
by
the
convents
and
brought
results
only
for
them
but
the
convents
were
abnormal
social
institutions
founded
on
celibacy
they
could
do
exceptional
work
but
they
had
to
remain
exceptions
themselves
for
this
very
reason
yet
some
progress
had
been
made
during
these
four
hundred
years
although
in
the
end
we
find
the
same
main
classes
as
in
the
beginning
still
the
human
beings
that
made
up
these
classes
had
changed
the
ancient
slavery
had
disappeared
gone
were
also
the
beggared
freemen
who
had
despised
work
as
slavish
between
the
roman
colonist
and
the
new
serf
there
had
been
the
free
frank
peasant
the
useless
remembrance
and
the
vain
feud
of
the
decaying
roman
nation
was
dead
and
gone
the
social
classes
of
the
ninth
century
had
been
formed
during
the
travail
of
a
new
civilization
not
in
the
demoralization
of
a
sinking
one
the
new
race
masters
and
servants
were
a
race
of
men
as
compared
to
their
roman
predecessors
the
relation
of
powerful
landlords
to
serving
peasants
which
had
been
the
unavoidable
result
of
collapse
in
the
antique
world
was
for
the
franks
the
point
of
departure
on
a
new
line
of
development
moreover
unproductive
as
these
four
hundred
years
may
appear
they
left
behind
one
great
product
the
modern
nationalities
the
reorganization
and
differentiation
of
west
european
humanity
for
the
coming
history
the
germans
had
indeed
infused
a
new
life
into
europe
therefore
the
dissolution
of
the
states
in
the
german
period
did
not
end
in
a
subjugation
after
the
plan
but
in
a
continued
development
of
the
estate
of
the
royal
beneficiaries
and
an
increasing
submission
commendatio
to
feudalism
and
in
such
a
tremendous
increase
of
the
population
that
no
more
than
two
centuries
later
the
bloody
drain
of
the
crusades
could
be
sustained
without
injury
what
was
the
mysterious
charm
by
which
the
germans
infused
a
new
life
into
decrepit
europe
was
it
an
innate
magic
power
of
the
german
race
as
our
jingo
historians
would
have
it
by
no
means
of
course
the
germans
were
a
highly
gifted
aryan
branch
and
especially
at
that
time
in
full
process
of
vigorous
development
they
did
not
however
rejuvenate
europe
by
their
specific
national
properties
but
simply
by
their
barbarism
their
gentile
constitution
their
personal
efficiency
and
bravery
their
love
of
liberty
and
their
democratic
instinct
which
regarded
all
public
affairs
as
its
own
affairs
in
short
all
those
properties
which
the
romans
had
lost
and
which
were
alone
capable
of
forming
new
states
and
raising
new
nationalities
out
of
the
muck
of
the
roman
world
what
were
they
but
characteristic
marks
of
the
barbarians
in
the
upper
stage
fruits
of
the
gentile
constitution
if
they
transformed
the
antique
form
of
monogamy
mitigated
the
male
rule
in
the
family
and
gave
a
higher
position
to
women
than
the
classic
world
had
ever
known
what
enabled
them
to
do
so
unless
it
was
their
barbarism
their
gentile
customs
their
living
inheritance
of
the
time
of
maternal
law
if
they
could
safely
transmit
a
trace
of
the
genuine
gentile
order
the
mark
communes
to
the
feudal
states
of
at
least
three
of
the
most
important
countries
germany
north
of
france
and
england
and
thus
give
a
local
coherence
and
the
means
of
resistance
to
the
oppressed
class
the
peasants
even
under
the
hardest
medieval
serfdom
means
which
neither
the
slaves
of
antiquity
nor
the
modern
proletarian
found
ready
at
hand
to
whom
did
they
owe
this
unless
it
was
again
their
barbarism
their
exclusively
barbarian
mode
of
settling
in
gentes
and
in
conclusion
if
they
could
develop
and
universally
introduce
the
mild
form
of
servitude
which
they
had
been
practicing
at
home
and
which
more
and
more
displaced
slavery
also
in
the
roman
empire
to
whom
was
it
due
unless
it
was
again
their
barbarism
thanks
to
which
they
had
not
yet
arrived
at
complete
slavery
neither
in
the
form
of
the
ancient
labor
slaves
nor
in
that
of
the
oriental
house
slaves
this
milder
form
of
servitude
as
fourier
first
stated
gave
to
the
oppressed
the
means
of
their
gradual
emancipation
as
a
class
fournit
aux
cultivateurs
des
moyens
collectif
et

and
is
therefore
far
superior
to
slavery
which
permits
only
the
immediate
enfranchisement
of
the
individual
without
any
transitory
stage
antiquity
did
not
know
any
abolition
of
slavery
by
rebellion
but
the
serfs
of
the
middle
ages
gradually
enforced
their
liberation
as
a
class
every
vital
and
productive
germ
with
which
the
germans
inoculated
the
roman
world
was
due
to
barbarism
indeed
only
barbarians
are
capable
of
rejuvenating
a
world
laboring
under
the
death
throes
of
unnerved
civilization
and
the
higher
stage
of
barbarism

which
and

which
the

chapter

barbarism
and
civilization
having
observed
the
dissolution
of
the
gentile
order
in
the
three
concrete
cases
of
the
greek
roman
and
german
nations
we
may
now
investigate
in
conclusion
the
general
economic
conditions
that
began
by
undermining
the
gentile
organization
of
society
during
the
upper
stage
of
barbarism
and
ended
by
doing
away
with
it
entirely
at
the
advent
of
civilization
marx
capital
will
be
as
necessary
for
the
successful
completion
of
this
task
as
morgan
ancient
society
a
growth
of
the
middle
stage
and
a
product
of
further
development
during
the
upper
stage
of
savagery
the
gens
reached
its
prime
as
near
as
we
can
judge
from
our
sources
of
information
in
the
lower
stage
of
barbarism
with
this
stage
then
we
begin
our
investigation
in
our
standard
example
the
american
redskins
of
that
time
we
find
the
gentile
constitution
fully
developed
a
tribe
had
differentiated
into
several
gentes
generally
two
through
the
increase
of
the
population
these
original
gentes
again
divided
into
several
daughter
gentes
making
the
mother
gens
a
phratry
the
tribe
itself
split
up
into
several
tribes
in
each
of
which
we
again
meet
a
large
number
of
representatives
of
the
old
gentes
in
certain
cases
a
federation
united
the
related
tribes
this
simple
organization
fully
sufficed
for
the
social
conditions
out
of
which
it
had
grown
it
was
nothing
else
than
the
innate
spontaneous
expression
of
those
conditions
and
it
was
well
calculated
to
smooth
over
all
internal
difficulties
that
could
arise
in
this
social
organization
external
difficulties
were
settled
by
war
such
a
war
could
end
in
the
annihilation
of
a
tribe
but
never
in
its
subjugation
it
is
the
grandeur
and
at
the
same
time
the
limitation
of
the
gentile
order
that
it
has
no
room
either
for
masters
or
servants
there
were
as
yet
no
distinctions
between
rights
and
duties
the
question
whether
he
had
a
right
to
take
part
in
public
affairs
to
practice
blood
revenge
or
to
demand
atonement
for
injuries
would
have
appeared
as
absurd
to
an
indian
as
the
question
whether
it
was
his
duty
to
eat
sleep
and
hunt
nor
could
any
division
of
a
tribe
or
gens
into
different
classes
take
place
this
leads
us
to
the
investigation
of
the
economic
basis
of
those
conditions
the
population
was
very
small
in
numbers
it
was
collected
only
on
the
territory
of
the
tribe
next
to
this
territory
was
the
hunting
ground
surrounding
it
in
a
wide
circle
a
neutral
forest
formed
the
line
of
demarcation
from
other
tribes
the
division
of
labor
was
quite
primitive
the
work
was
simply
divided
between
the
two
sexes
the
men
went
to
war
hunted
fished
provided
the
raw
material
for
food
and
the
tools
necessary
for
these
pursuits
the
women
cared
for
the
house
and
prepared
food
and
clothing
they
cooked
weaved
and
sewed
each
sex
was
master
of
its
own
field
of
activity
the
men
in
the
forest
the
women
in
the
house
each
sex
also
owned
the
tools
made
and
used
by
it
the
men
were
the
owners
of
the
weapons
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
tackle
the
women
of
the
household
goods
and
utensils
the
household
was
communistic
comprising
several
and
often
many
families
whatever
was
produced
and
used
collectively
was
regarded
as
common
property
the
house
the
garden
the
long
boat
here
and
only
here
then
do
we
find
the
property
which
jurists
and
economists
have
falsely
attributed
to
civilized
society
the
last
deceptive
pretext
of
legality
on
which
modern
capitalist
property
is
leaning
but
humanity
did
not
everywhere
remain
in
this
stage
in
asia
they
found
animals
that
could
be
tamed
and
propagated
in
captivity
the
wild
buffalo
cow
had
to
be
hunted
down
the
tame
cow
gave
birth
to
a
calf
once
a
year
and
also
furnished
milk
some
of
the
most
advanced
tribes
aryans
semites
perhaps
also
turanians
devoted
themselves
mainly
to
taming
and
later
to
raising
and
tending
domestic
animals
the
segregation
of
cattle
raising
tribes
from
the
rest
of
the
barbarians
constitutes
the
first
great
division
of
social
labor
these
stock
raising
tribes
did
not
only
produce
more
articles
of
food
than
the
rest
of
the
barbarians
but
also
different
kinds
of
products
they
were
ahead
of
the
others
by
having
at
their
disposal
not
alone
milk
milk
products
and
a
greater
abundance
of
meat
but
also
skins
wool
goat
hair
and
the
spun
and
woven
goods
which
the
growing
abundance
of
the
raw
material
brought
into
common
use
this
for
the
first
time
made
a
regular
exchange
of
products
possible
in
former
stages
exchange
could
only
take
place
occasionally
and
an
exceptional
ability
in
manufacturing
weapons
and
tools
may
have
led
to
a
transient
division
of
labor
for
example
unquestionable
remains
of
workshops
for
stone
implements
of
the
neolithic
period
have
been
found
in
many
places
the
artists
who
developed
their
ability
in
those
shops
most
probably
worked
for
the
collectivity
as
did
the
artisans
of
the
indian
gentile
order
at
any
rate
no
other
exchange
than
that
within
the
tribe
could
exist
in
that
stage
and
even
that
was
an
exception
but
after
the
segregation
of
the
stock
raising
tribes
we
find
all
the
conditions
favorable
to
an
exchange
between
groups
of
different
tribes
and
to
a
further
development
of
this
mode
of
trading
into
a
fixed
institution
originally
tribe
exchanged
with
tribe
through
the
agency
of
their
tribal
heads
but
when
the
herds
drifted
into
the
hands
of
private
individuals
then
the
exchange
between
individuals
prevailed
more
and
more
until
it
became
the
established
form
the
principal
article
of
exchange
which
the
stock
raising
tribes
offered
to
their
neighbors
was
in
the
form
of
domestic
animals
cattle
became
the
favorite
commodity
by
which
all
other
commodities
were
measured
in
exchange
in
short
cattle
assumed
the
functions
of
money
and
served
in
this
capacity
as
early
as
that
stage
with
such
necessity
and
rapidity
was
the
demand
for
a
money
commodity
developed
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
exchange
of
commodities
horticulture
probably
unknown
to
the
asiatic
barbarians
of
the
lower
stage
arose
not
later
than
the
middle
stage
of
barbarism
as
the
forerunner
of
agriculture
the
climate
of
the
turanian
highland
does
not
admit
of
a
nomadic
life
without
a
supply
of
stock
feed
for
the
long
and
hard
winter
hence
the
cultivation
of
meadows
and
grain
was
indispensable
the
same
is
true
of
the
steppes
north
of
the
black
sea
once
grain
had
been
grown
for
cattle
it
soon
became
human
food
the
cultivated
land
belonged
as
yet
to
the
tribe
and
was
assigned
first
to
the
gens
which
in
its
turn
distributed
it
to
the
households
and
finally
to
individuals
always
for
use
only
not
for
possession
the
users
may
have
had
certain
claims
to
the
land
but
that
was
all
two
of
the
industrial
acquisitions
of
this
stage
are
especially
important
the
first
is
the
weaving
loom
the
second
the
melting
of
metal
ore
and
the
use
of
metals
in
manufacture
copper
tin
and
their
alloy
bronze
were
the
most
essential
of
them
bronze
furnished
tools
and
weapons
but
could
not
displace
stone
implements
only
iron
could
have
done
that
but
the
production
of
iron
was
as
yet
unknown
gold
and
silver
were
already
used
for
ornament
and
decoration
and
must
have
been
far
more
precious
than
copper
and
bronze
the
increase
of
production
in
all
branches
stock
raising
agriculture
domestic
handicrafts
enabled
human
labor
power
to
produce
more
than
was
necessary
for
its
maintenance
it
increased
at
the
same
time
the
amount
of
daily
work
that
fell
to
the
lot
of
every
member
of
a
gens
a
household
or
a
single
family
the
addition
of
more
labor
power
became
desirable
it
was
furnished
by
war
the
captured
enemies
were
transformed
into
slaves
under
the
given
historical
conditions
the
first
great
division
of
social
labor
by
increasing
the
productivity
of
labor
adding
to
the
wealth
and
enlarging
the
field
of
productive
activity
necessarily
carried
slavery
in
its
wake
out
of
the
first
great
division
of
social
labor
arose
the
first
great
division
of
society
into
two
classes
masters
and
servants
exploiters
and
exploited
how
and
when
the
herds
were
transferred
from
the
collective
ownership
of
the
tribe
or
gens
to
the
proprietorship
of
the
heads
of
the
families
is
not
known
to
us
but
it
must
have
been
practically
accomplished
in
this
stage
the
herds
and
the
other
new
objects
of
wealth
brought
about
a
revolution
in
the
family
procuring
the
means
of
existence
had
always
been
the
man
business
the
tools
of
production
were
manufactured
and
owned
by
him
the
herds
were
the
new
tools
of
production
and
their
taming
and
tending
was
his
work
hence
he
owned
the
cattle
and
the
commodities
and
slaves
obtained
in
exchange
for
them
all
the
surplus
now
resulting
from
production
fell
to
the
share
of
the
man
the
woman
shared
in
its
fruition
but
she
could
not
claim
its
ownership
the
savage
warrior
and
hunter
had
been
content
to
occupy
the
second
place
in
the
house
to
give
precedence
to
the
woman
the
gentler
shepherd
standing
on
his
wealth
assumed
the
first
place
and
forced
the
woman
back
into
the
second
place
and
she
had
no
occasion
to
complain
the
division
of
labor
in
the
family
had
regulated
the
distribution
of
property
between
man
and
wife
this
division
of
labor
remained
unchanged
yet
the
former
domestic
relation
was
now
reversed
simply
because
the
division
of
labor
outside
of
the
family
had
been
altered
the
same
cause
that
once
had
secured
the
supremacy
in
the
house
for
women
the
confining
of
women
activity
to
domestic
labor
now
assured
the
supremacy
of
the
men
in
the
households
the
domestic
labor
of
women
was
considered
insignificant
in
comparison
to
men
work
for
a
living
the
latter
was
everything
the
former
a
negligible
quantity
at
this
early
stage
we
can
already
see
that
the
emancipation
of
women
and
their
equality
with
men
are
impossible
and
remain
so
as
long
as
women
are
excluded
from
social
production
and
restricted
to
domestic
labor
the
emancipation
of
women
becomes
feasible
only
then
when
women
are
enabled
to
take
part
extensively
in
social
production
and
when
domestic
duties
require
their
attention
in
a
minor
degree
this
state
of
things
was
brought
about
by
the
modern
great
industries
which
not
only
admit
of
women
liberal
participation
in
production
but
actually
call
for
it
and
besides
endeavor
to
transform
domestic
work
also
into
a
public
industry
man
advent
to
practical
supremacy
in
the
household
marked
the
removal
of
the
last
barrier
to
his
universal
supremacy
his
unlimited
rule
was
emphasized
and
endowed
with
continuity
by
the
downfall
of
matriarchy
the
introduction
of
patriarchy
and
the
gradual
transition
from
the
pairing
family
to
the
monogamic
family
this
made
a
breach
in
the
old
gentile
order
the
monogamic
family
became
a
power
and
lifted
a
threatening
hand
against
the
gens
the
next
step
brings
us
to
the
upper
stage
of
barbarism
that
period
in
which
all
nations
of
civilization
go
through
their
heroic
era
it
is
the
time
of
the
iron
sword
but
also
of
the
iron
plow
share
and
axe
the
iron
had
become
the
servant
of
man
it
is
the
last
and
most
important
of
all
raw
products
that
play
a
revolutionary
role
in
history
the
last
if
we
except
the
potato
iron
brought
about
agriculture
on
a
larger
scale
and
the
clearing
of
extensive
forest
tracts
for
cultivation
it
gave
to
the
craftsman
a
tool
of
such
hardness
and
sharpness
that
no
stone
no
other
known
metal
could
withstand
it
all
this
came
about
gradually
the
first
iron
was
often
softer
than
bronze
therefore
stone
implements
disappeared
very
slowly
not
only
in
the
hildebrand
song
but
also
at
hastings
in
stone
axes
were
still
used
in
fighting
but
progress
was
now
irresistible
less
interrupted
and
more
rapid
the
town
inclosing
houses
of
stone
or
tiles
within
its
turreted
and
crested
stone
walls
became
the
central
seat
of
the
tribe
or
federation
of
tribes
it
showed
an
astounding
progress
of
architecture
but
also
an
increase
of
danger
and
of
the
demand
for
protection
wealth
increased
rapidly
but
it
was
the
wealth
of
private
individuals
weaving
metal
work
and
other
more
and
more
differentiating
industries
developed
an
increasing
variety
and
display
of
art
in
production
agriculture
furnished
not
alone
grain
peas
beans
and
fruit
but
also
oil
and
wine
the
preparation
of
which
had
now
been
learned
such
a
diversity
of
action
could
not
be
displayed
by
any
single
individual
the
second
great
division
of
labor
took
place
handicrafts
separated
from
agriculture
the
growing
intensity
of
production
and
the
increased
productivity
enhanced
the
value
of
human
labor
power
slavery
which
had
been
a
rising
and
sporadic
factor
in
the
preceding
stage
now
became
an
essential
part
of
the
social
system
the
slaves
ceased
to
be
simple
assistants
they
were
now
driven
in
scores
to
the
work
in
the
fields
and
shops
the
division
of
production
into
two
great
branches
agriculture
and
handicrafts
gave
rise
to
production
for
exchange
the
production
of
commodities
trade
arose
at
the
same
time
not
only
in
the
interior
and
on
the
tribal
boundaries
but
also
in
the
form
of
maritime
exchange
all
this
was
as
yet
in
a
very
undeveloped
state
the
precious
metals
gained
preference
as
a
universal
money
commodity
but
still
uncoined
and
exchanged
merely
by
dead
weight
the
distinction
between
rich
and
poor
was
added
to
that
between
free
men
and
slaves
this
and
the
new
division
of
labor
constitute
a
new
division
of
society
into
classes
the
differences
in
the
amount
of
property
belonging
to
the
several
family
heads
broke
up
the
old
communistic
households
one
by
one
wherever
they
might
have
been
preserved
thus
far
this
made
an
end
to
the
collective
cultivation
of
the
soil
for
the
account
of
the
community
the
cultivated
land
was
assigned
for
use
to
the
several
families
first
for
a
limited
time
later
for
once
and
all
the
transition
to
full
private
property
was
accomplished
gradually
and
simultaneously
with
the
transition
from
the
pairing
family
to
monogamy
the
monogamous
family
began
to
be
the
economic
unit
of
society
the
increase
of
population
necessitated
a
closer
consolidation
against
internal
and
external
foes
the
federation
of
related
tribes
became
unavoidable
their
amalgamation
and
thence
the
amalgamation
of
the
separate
tribal
territories
to
one
national
territory
was
the
following
step
the
military
leader
rex
basileus
thiudans
became
an
indispensable
and
standing
official
the
public
meeting
was
introduced
wherever
it
did
not
yet
exist
the
military
leader
the
council
of
chiefs
and
the
public
meeting
formed
the
organs
of
the
military
democracy
that
had
grown
out
of
the
gentile
constitution
military
democracy
for
now
war
and
organization
for
war
were
regular
functions
of
social
life
the
wealth
of
the
neighbors
excited
the
greed
of
nations
that
began
to
regard
the
acquisition
of
wealth
as
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
their
life
they
were
barbarians
robbing
appeared
to
them
easier
and
more
honorable
than
producing
war
once
simply
a
revenge
for
transgressions
or
a
means
for
enlarging
a
territory
that
had
become
too
narrow
was
now
waged
for
the
sake
of
plunder
alone
and
became
a
regular
profession
not
in
vain
did
threatening
walls
cast
a
rigid
stare
all
around
the
new
fortified
towns
their
yawning
ditches
were
the
tomb
of
the
gentile
constitution
and
their
turrets
already
reached
up
into
civilization
the
internal
affairs
underwent
a
similar
change
the
plundering
wars
increased
the
power
of
the
military
leader
and
of
the
subcommanders
the
habitual
election
of
the
successors
from
the
same
family
was
gradually
transformed
into
hereditary
succession
first
by
sufferance
then
by
claim
and
finally
by
usurpation
thus
the
foundation
of
hereditary
royalty
and
nobility
was
laid
in
this
manner
the
organs
of
the
gentile
constitution
were
gradually
torn
away
from
their
roots
in
the
nation
tribe
phratry
and
gens
and
the
whole
gentile
order
reversed
into
its
antithesis
the
organization
of
tribes
for
the
purpose
of
the
free
administration
of
affairs
was
turned
into
an
organization
for
plundering
and
oppressing
their
neighbors
the
organs
of
gentilism
changed
from
servants
of
the
public
will
to
independent
organs
of
rule
oppressing
their
own
people
this
could
not
have
happened
if
the
greed
for
wealth
had
not
divided
the
gentiles
into
rich
and
poor
if
the
difference
of
property
in
a
gens
had
not
changed
the
community
of
interest
into
antagonism
of
the
gentiles
karl
marx
and
if
the
extension
of
slavery
had
not
begun
by
branding
work
for
a
living
as
slavish
and
more
ignominious
than
plundering
we
have
now
reached
the
threshold
of
civilization
this
stage
is
inaugurated
by
a
new
progress
in
the
division
of
labor
in
the
lower
stage
of
barbarism
production
was
carried
on
for
use
only
any
acts
of
exchange
were
confined
to
single
cases
when
a
surplus
was
accidentally
realized
in
the
middle
stage
of
barbarism
we
find
that
the
possession
of
cattle
gave
a
regular
surplus
to
the
nomadic
nations
with
sufficiently
large
herds
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
division
of
labor
between
nomadic
nations
and
backward
nations
without
herds
the
existence
of
two
different
stages
of
production
side
by
side
furnished
the
conditions
necessary
for
a
regular
exchange
the
upper
stage
of
barbarism
introduced
a
new
division
of
labor
between
agriculture
and
handicrafts
resulting
in
the
production
of
a
continually
increasing
amount
of
commodities
for
the
special
purpose
of
exchange
so
that
exchange
between
individuals
became
a
vital
function
of
society
civilization
strengthened
and
intensified
all
the
established
divisions
of
labor
especially
by
rendering
the
contrast
between
city
and
country
more
pronounced
either
the
town
may
have
the
economic
control
over
the
country
as
during
antiquity
or
vice
versa
as
in
the
middle
ages
a
third
division
of
labor
was
added
by
civilization
it
created
a
class
that
did
not
take
part
in
production
but
occupied
itself
merely
with
the
exchange
of
products
the
merchants
all
former
attempts
at
class
formation
were
exclusively
concerned
with
production
they
divided
the
producers
into
directors
and
directed
or
into
producers
on
a
more
or
less
extensive
scale
but
here
a
class
appears
for
the
first
time
that
captures
the
control
of
production
in
general
and
subjugates
the
producers
to
its
rule
without
taking
the
least
part
in
production
a
class
that
makes
itself
the
indispensable
mediator
between
two
producers
and
exploits
them
both
under
the
pretext
of
saving
them
the
trouble
and
risk
of
exchange
of
extending
the
markets
for
their
products
to
distant
regions
and
of
thus
becoming
the
most
useful
class
in
society
a
class
of
parasites
genuine
social
ichneumons
that
skim
the
cream
off
production
at
home
and
abroad
as
a
reward
for
very
insignificant
services
that
rapidly
amass
enormous
wealth
and
gain
social
influence
accordingly
that
for
this
reason
reap
ever
new
honors
and
ever
greater
control
of
production
during
the
period
of
civilization
until
they
at
last
bring
to
light
a
product
of
their
own
periodical
crises
in
industry
at
the
stage
of
production
under
discussion
our
young
merchant
class
had
no
inkling
as
yet
of
the
great
future
that
was
in
store
for
them
but
they
continued
to
organize
to
make
themselves
invaluable
and
that
was
sufficient
for
the
moment
at
the
same
time
metal
coins
came
into
use
and
through
them
a
new
device
for
controlling
the
producers
and
their
products
the
commodity
of
commodities
that
was
hiding
all
other
commodities
in
its
mysterious
bosom
had
been
discovered
a
charm
that
could
be
transformed
at
will
into
any
desirable
or
coveted
thing
whoever
held
it
in
his
possession
had
the
world
of
production
at
his
command
and
who
had
it
above
all
others
the
merchant
in
his
hands
the
cult
of
money
was
safe
he
took
care
to
make
it
plain
that
all
commodities
and
hence
all
producers
must
prostrate
themselves
in
adoration
before
money
he
proved
by
practice
that
all
other
forms
of
wealth
are
reduced
to
thin
wraiths
before
this
personification
of
riches
never
again
did
the
power
of
money
show
itself
in
such
primordial
brutality
and
violence
as
in
its
youthful
days
after
the
sale
of
commodities
for
money
came
the
borrowing
of
money
resulting
in
interest
and
usury
and
no
legislation
of
any
later
period
stretches
the
debtor
so
mercilessly
at
the
feet
of
the
speculating
creditor
as
the
antique
grecian
and
roman
codes
both
of
them
spontaneous
products
of
habit
without
any
other
than
economic
pressure
the
wealth
in
commodities
and
slaves
was
now
further
increased
by
large
holdings
in
land
the
titles
of
the
individuals
to
the
lots
of
land
formerly
assigned
to
them
by
the
gens
or
tribe
had
become
so
well
established
that
these
lots
were
now
owned
and
inherited
what
the
individuals
had
most
desired
of
late
was
the
liberation
from
the
claim
of
the
gentiles
to
their
lots
a
claim
which
had
become
a
veritable
fetter
for
them
they
were
rid
of
this
fetter
but
soon
after
they
were
also
rid
of
their
lots
the
full
free
ownership
of
the
soil
implied
not
only
the
possibility
of
uncurtailed
possession
but
also
of
selling
the
soil
as
long
as
the
soil
belonged
to
the
gens
this
was
impossible
but
when
the
new
land
owner
shook
off
the
chains
of
the
priority
claim
of
the
gens
and
tribe
he
also
tore
the
bond
that
had
so
long
tied
him
indissolubly
to
the
soil
what
that
meant
was
impressed
on
him
by
the
money
invented
simultaneously
with
the
advent
of
private
property
in
land
the
soil
could
now
become
a
commodity
to
be
bought
and
sold
hardly
had
private
ownership
of
land
been
introduced
when
the
mortgage
put
in
its
appearance
see
athens
as
hetaerism
and
prostitution
clung
to
the
heels
of
monogamy
so
does
from
now
on
the
mortgage
to
private
ownership
in
land
you
have
clamored
for
free
full
saleable
land
well
then
there
you
have
it
tu
voulu
georges
dandin
it
was
your
own
wish
george
dandin
industrial
expansion
money
usury
private
land
and
mortgage
thus
progressed
with
the
concentration
and
centralization
of
wealth
in
the
hands
of
a
small
class
accompanied
by
the
increasing
impoverishment
of
the
masses
and
the
increasing
mass
of
paupers
the
new
aristocracy
of
wealth
so
far
as
it
did
not
coincide
with
the
old
tribal
nobility
forced
the
latter
permanently
into
the
background
in
athens
in
rome
among
the
germans
and
this
division
of
free
men
into
classes
according
to
their
wealth
was
accompanied
especially
in
greece
by
an
enormous
increase
in
the
number
of
slaves
whose
forced
labor
formed
the
basis
on
which
the
whole
superstructure
of
society
was
reared
let
us
now
see
what
became
of
the
gentile
constitution
through
this
revolution
of
society
gentilism
stood
powerless
in
the
face
of
the
new
elements
that
had
grown
without
its
assistance
it
was
dependent
on
the
condition
that
the
members
of
a
gens
or
of
a
tribe
should
live
together
in
the
same
territory
and
be
its
exclusive
inhabitants
that
had
long
ceased
to
be
the
case
gentes
and
tribes
were
everywhere
hopelessly
intermingled
slaves
clients
and
foreigners
lived
among
citizens
the
capacity
for
settling
down
permanently
which
had
only
been
acquired
near
the
end
of
the
middle
stage
of
barbarism
was
time
and
again
sidetracked
by
the
necessity
of
changing
the
abode
according
to
the
dictates
of
commerce
different
occupations
and
the
transfer
of
land
the
members
of
the
gentile
organizations
could
no
longer
meet
for
the
purpose
of
taking
care
of
their
common
interests
only
matters
of
little
importance
such
as
religious
festivals
were
still
observed
in
an
indifferent
way
beside
the
wants
and
interests
for
the
care
of
which
the
gentile
organs
were
appointed
and
fitted
new
wants
and
interests
had
arisen
from
the
revolution
of
the
conditions
of
existence
and
the
resulting
change
in
social
classification
these
new
wants
and
interests
were
not
only
alien
to
the
old
gentile
order
but
thwarted
it
in
every
way
the
interests
of
the
craftsmen
created
by
division
of
labor
and
the
special
necessities
of
a
town
differing
from
those
of
the
country
required
new
organs
but
every
one
of
these
groups
was
composed
of
people
from
different
gentes
phratries
and
tribes
they
included
even
strangers
hence
the
new
organs
necessarily
had
to
form
outside
of
the
gentile
constitution
but
by
the
side
of
it
meant
against
it
and
again
in
every
gentile
organization
the
conflict
of
interests
made
itself
felt
and
reached
its
climax
by
combining
rich
and
poor
usurers
and
debtors
in
the
same
gens
and
tribe
there
was
furthermore
the
mass
of
inhabitants
who
were
strangers
to
the
gentiles
these
strangers
could
become
very
powerful
as
in
rome
and
they
were
too
numerous
to
be
gradually
absorbed
by
the
gentes
and
tribes
the
gentiles
confronted
these
masses
as
a
compact
body
of
privileged
individuals
what
had
once
been
a
natural
democracy
had
been
transformed
into
an
odious
aristocracy
the
gentile
constitution
had
grown
out
of
a
society
that
did
not
know
any
internal
contradictions
and
it
was
only
adapted
to
such
a
society
it
had
no
coërcive
power
except
public
opinion
but
now
a
society
had
developed
that
by
force
of
all
its
economic
conditions
of
existence
divided
humanity
into
freemen
and
slaves
and
exploiting
rich
and
exploited
poor
a
society
that
not
only
could
never
reconcile
these
contradictions
but
drove
them
ever
more
to
a
climax
such
a
society
could
only
exist
by
a
continual
open
struggle
of
all
classes
against
one
another
or
under
the
supremacy
of
a
third
power
that
under
a
pretense
of
standing
above
the
struggling
classes
stifled
their
open
conflict
and
permitted
a
class
struggle
only
on
the
economic
field
in
a
legal
form
gentilism
had
ceased
to
live
it
was
crushed
by
the
division
of
labor
and
by
its
result
the
division
of
society
into
classes
it
was
replaced
by
the
state
in
preceding
chapters
we
have
shown
by
three
concrete
examples
the
three
main
forms
in
which
the
state
was
built
up
on
the
ruins
of
gentilism
athens
represented
the
simplest
the
classic
type
the
state
grew
directly
and
mainly
out
of
class
divisions
that
developed
within
gentile
society
in
rome
the
gentile
organization
became
an
exclusive
aristocracy
amid
a
numerous
plebs
of
outsiders
who
had
only
duties
but
no
rights
the
victory
of
the
plebs
burst
the
old
gentile
order
asunder
and
erected
on
its
remains
the
state
which
soon
engulfed
both
gentile
aristocracy
and
plebs
finally
among
the
german
conquerors
of
the
roman
empire
the
state
grew
as
a
direct
result
of
the
conquest
of
large
foreign
territories
which
the
gentile
constitution
was
powerless
to
control
but
this
conquest
did
not
necessitate
either
a
serious
fight
with
the
former
population
or
a
more
advanced
division
of
labor
conquerors
and
conquered
were
almost
in
the
same
stage
of
economic
development
so
that
the
economic
basis
of
society
remained
undisturbed
hence
gentilism
could
preserve
for
many
centuries
an
unchanged
territorial
character
in
the
form
of
mark
communes
and
even
rejuvenate
itself
in
the
nobility
and
patrician
families
of
later
years
or
in
the
peasantry
as
in
dithmarsia
the
state
then
is
by
no
means
a
power
forced
on
society
from
outside
neither
is
it
the
realization
of
the
ethical
idea
the
image
and
the
realization
of
reason
as
hegel
maintains
it
is
simply
a
product
of
society
at
a
certain
stage
of
evolution
it
is
the
confession
that
this
society
has
become
hopelessly
divided
against
itself
has
entangled
itself
in
irreconcilable
contradictions
which
it
is
powerless
to
banish
in
order
that
these
contradictions
these
classes
with
conflicting
economic
interests
may
not
annihilate
themselves
and
society
in
a
useless
struggle
a
power
becomes
necessary
that
stands
apparently
above
society
and
has
the
function
of
keeping
down
the
conflicts
and
maintaining
order
and
this
power
the
outgrowth
of
society
but
assuming
supremacy
over
it
and
becoming
more
and
more
divorced
from
it
is
the
state
the
state
differs
from
gentilism
in
that
it
first
divides
its
members
by
territories
as
we
have
seen
the
old
bonds
of
blood
kinship
uniting
the
gentile
bodies
had
become
inefficient
because
they
were
dependent
on
the
condition
now
no
longer
a
fact
that
all
gentiles
should
live
on
a
certain
territory
the
territory
was
the
same
but
the
human
beings
had
changed
hence
the
division
by
territories
was
chosen
as
the
point
of
departure
and
citizens
had
to
exercise
their
rights
and
duties
wherever
they
chose
their
abode
without
regard
to
gens
and
tribe
this
organization
of
inhabitants
by
localities
is
a
common
feature
of
all
states
it
seems
natural
to
us
now
but
we
have
seen
what
long
and
hard
fighting
was
required
before
it
could
take
in
athens
and
rome
the
place
of
the
old
organization
by
blood
kinship
in
the
second
place
the
state
created
a
public
power
of
coërcion
that
did
no
longer
coincide
with
the
old
and
armed
population
this
special
power
of
coërcion
is
necessary
because
a
army
of
the
people
has
become
impossible
since
the
division
of
society
into
classes
took
place
for
the
slaves
belonged
also
to
society
the
citizens
of
athens
formed
only
a
privileged
class
compared
to
the
slaves
the
popular
army
of
the
athenian
democracy
was
an
aristocratic
public
power
designed
to
keep
the
slaves
down
but
we
have
seen
that
a
police
force
became
also
necessary
to
maintain
order
among
the
citizens
this
public
power
of
coërcion
exists
in
every
state
it
is
not
composed
of
armed
men
alone
but
has
also
such
objects
as
prisons
and
correction
houses
attached
to
it
that
were
unknown
to
gentilism
it
may
be
very
small
almost
infinitesimal
in
societies
with
feebly
developed
class
antagonisms
and
in
out
of
the
way
places
as
was
once
the
case
in
certain
regions
of
the
united
states
but
it
increases
in
the
same
ratio
in
which
the
class
antagonisms
become
more
pronounced
and
in
which
neighboring
states
become
larger
and
more
populous
a
conspicuous
example
is
modern
europe
where
the
class
struggles
and
wars
of
conquest
have
nursed
the
public
power
to
such
a
size
that
it
threatens
to
swallow
the
whole
society
and
the
state
itself
in
order
to
maintain
this
public
power
contributions
of
the
citizens
become
necessary
the
taxes
these
were
absolutely
unknown
in
gentile
society
but
we
get
our
full
measure
of
them
as
civilization
makes
further
progress
these
taxes
are
no
longer
sufficient
to
cover
public
expenses
the
state
makes
drafts
on
the
future
contracts
loans
public
debts
old
europe
can
tell
a
story
of
them
in
possession
of
the
public
power
and
of
the
right
of
taxation
the
officials
in
their
capacity
as
state
organs
are
now
exalted
above
society
the
free
and
voluntary
respect
that
was
accorded
to
the
organs
of
gentilism
does
not
satisfy
them
any
more
even
if
they
might
have
it
representatives
of
a
power
that
is
divorced
from
society
they
must
enforce
respect
by
exceptional
laws
that
render
them
specially
sacred
and
inviolable
the
lowest
police
employee
of
the
civilized
state
has
more
authority
than
all
the
organs
of
gentilism
combined
but
the
mightiest
prince
and
the
greatest
statesman
or
general
of
civilization
may
look
with
envy
on
the
spontaneous
and
undisputed
esteem
that
was
the
privilege
of
the
least
gentile
sachem
the
one
stands
in
the
middle
of
society
the
other
is
forced
to
assume
a
position
outside
and
above
it
the
state
is
the
result
of
the
desire
to
keep
down
class
conflicts
but
having
arisen
amid
these
conflicts
it
is
as
a
rule
the
state
of
the
most
powerful
economic
class
that
by
force
of
its
economic
supremacy
becomes
also
the
ruling
political
class
and
thus
acquires
new
means
of
subduing
and
exploiting
the
oppressed
masses
the
antique
state
was
therefore
the
state
of
the
slave
owners
for
the
purpose
of
holding
the
slaves
in
check
the
feudal
state
was
the
organ
of
the
nobility
for
the
oppression
of
the
serfs
and
dependent
farmers
the
modern
representative
state
is
the
tool
of
the
capitalist
exploiters
of
wage
labor
at
certain
periods
it
occurs
exceptionally
that
the
struggling
classes
balance
each
other
so
nearly
that
the
public
power
gains
a
certain
degree
of
independence
by
posing
as
the
mediator
between
them
the
absolute
monarchy
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
century
was
in
such
a
position
balancing
the
nobles
and
the
burghers
against
one
another
so
was
the
bonapartism
of
the
first
and
still
more
of
the
second
empire
playing
the
proletariat
against
the
bourgeoisie
and
vice
versa
the
latest
performance
of
this
kind
in
which
ruler
and
ruled
appear
equally
ridiculous
is
the
new
german
empire
of
bismarckian
make
in
which
capitalists
and
laborers
are
balanced
against
one
another
and
equally
cheated
for
the
benefit
of
the
degenerate
prussian
cabbage
junkers
in
most
of
the
historical
states
the
rights
of
the
citizens
are
differentiated
according
to
their
wealth
this
is
a
direct
confirmation
of
the
fact
that
the
state
is
organized
for
the
protection
of
the
possessing
against
the
classes
the
athenian
and
roman
classification
by
incomes
shows
this
it
is
also
seen
in
the
medieval
state
of
feudalism
in
which
the
political
power
depended
on
the
quantity
of
real
estate
it
is
again
seen
in
the
electoral
qualifications
of
the
modern
representative
state
the
political
recognition
of
the
differences
in
wealth
is
by
no
means
essential
on
the
contrary
it
marks
a
low
stage
of
state
development
the
highest
form
of
the
state
the
democratic
republic
knows
officially
nothing
of
property
distinctions
it
is
that
form
of
the
state
which
under
modern
conditions
of
society
becomes
more
and
more
an
unavoidable
necessity
the
last
decisive
struggle
between
proletariat
and
bourgeoisie
can
only
be
fought
out
under
this
state
form
in
such
a
state
wealth
exerts
its
power
indirectly
but
all
the
more
safely
this
is
done
partly
in
the
form
of
direct
corruption
of
officials
after
the
classical
type
of
the
united
states
or
in
the
form
of
an
alliance
between
government
and
bankers
which
is
established
all
the
more
easily
when
the
public
debt
increases
and
when
corporations
concentrate
in
their
hands
not
only
the
means
of
transportation
but
also
production
itself
using
the
stock
exchange
as
a
center
the
united
states
and
the
latest
french
republic
are
striking
examples
and
good
old
switzerland
has
contributed
its
share
to
illustrate
this
point
that
a
democratic
republic
is
not
necessary
for
this
fraternal
bond
between
stock
exchange
and
government
is
proved
by
england
and
last
not
least
germany
where
it
is
doubtful
whether
bismarck
or
bleichroeder
was
more
favored
by
the
introduction
of
universal
suffrage
the
possessing
class
rules
directly
through
universal
suffrage
for
as
long
as
the
oppressed
class
in
this
case
the
proletariat
is
not
ripe
for
its
economic
emancipation
just
so
long
will
its
majority
regard
the
existing
order
of
society
as
the
only
one
possible
and
form
the
tail
the
extreme
left
wing
of
the
capitalist
class
but
the
more
the
proletariat
matures
toward
its
the
more
does
it
constitute
itself
as
a
separate
class
and
elect
its
own
representatives
in
place
of
the
capitalists
universal
suffrage
is
the
gauge
of
the
maturity
of
the
working
class
it
can
and
will
never
be
anything
else
but
that
in
the
modern
state
but
that
is
sufficient
on
the
day
when
the
thermometer
of
universal
suffrage
reaches
its
boiling
point
among
the
laborers
they
as
well
as
the
capitalists
will
know
what
to
do
the
state
then
did
not
exist
from
all
eternity
there
have
been
societies
without
it
that
had
no
idea
of
any
state
or
public
power
at
a
certain
stage
of
economic
development
which
was
of
necessity
accompanied
by
a
division
of
society
into
classes
the
state
became
the
inevitable
result
of
this
division
we
are
now
rapidly
approaching
a
stage
of
evolution
in
production
in
which
the
existence
of
classes
has
not
only
ceased
to
be
a
necessity
but
becomes
a
positive
fetter
on
production
hence
these
classes
must
fall
as
inevitably
as
they
once
arose
the
state
must
irrevocably
fall
with
them
the
society
that
is
to
reorganize
production
on
the
basis
of
a
free
and
equal
association
of
the
producers
will
transfer
the
machinery
of
state
where
it
will
then
belong
into
the
museum
of
antiquities
by
the
side
of
the
spinning
wheel
and
the
bronze
ax
civilization
is
as
we
have
seen
that
stage
of
society
in
which
the
division
of
labor
the
resulting
exchange
between
individuals
and
the
production
of
commodities
combining
them
reach
their
highest
development
and
revolutionize
the
whole
society
the
production
of
all
former
stages
of
society
was
mainly
collective
and
consumption
was
carried
on
by
direct
division
of
products
within
more
or
less
small
communes
this
collective
production
was
confined
within
the
narrowest
limits
but
it
implied
the
control
of
production
and
of
the
products
by
the
producers
they
knew
what
became
of
their
product
it
did
not
leave
their
hands
until
it
was
consumed
by
them
as
long
as
production
moved
on
this
basis
it
could
not
grow
beyond
the
control
of
the
producers
and
it
could
not
create
any
strange
ghostly
forces
against
them
under
civilization
however
this
is
the
inevitable
rule
into
the
simple
process
of
production
the
division
of
labor
was
gradually
interpolated
it
undermined
the
communism
of
production
and
consumption
it
made
the
appropriation
of
products
by
single
individuals
the
prevailing
rule
and
thus
introduced
the
exchange
between
individuals
in
the
manner
mentioned
above
gradually
the
production
of
commodities
became
the
rule
this
mode
of
production
for
exchange
not
for
home
consumption
necessarily
passes
the
products
on
from
hand
to
hand
the
producer
gives
his
product
away
in
exchange
he
does
no
longer
know
what
becomes
of
it
with
the
advent
of
money
and
of
the
trader
who
steps
in
as
a
middleman
between
the
producers
the
process
of
exchange
becomes
still
more
complicated
the
fate
of
the
products
becomes
still
more
uncertain
the
number
of
merchants
is
great
and
one
does
not
know
what
the
other
is
doing
the
products
now
pass
not
only
from
hand
to
hand
but
also
from
market
to
market
the
producers
have
lost
the
control
of
the
aggregate
production
in
their
sphere
of
life
and
the
merchants
have
not
yet
acquired
this
control
products
and
production
become
the
victims
of
chance
but
chance
is
only
one
pole
of
an
interrelation
the
other
pole
of
which
is
called
necessity
in
nature
where
chance
seems
to
reign
also
we
have
long
ago
demonstrated
the
innate
necessity
and
law
that
determines
the
course
of
chance
on
every
line
but
what
is
true
of
nature
holds
also
good
of
society
whenever
a
social
function
or
a
series
of
social
processes
become
too
powerful
for
the
control
of
man
whenever
they
grow
beyond
the
grasp
of
man
and
seem
to
be
left
to
mere
chance
then
the
peculiar
and
innate
laws
of
such
processes
shape
the
course
of
chance
with
increased
elementary
necessity
such
laws
also
control
the
vicissitudes
of
the
production
and
exchange
of
commodities
for
the
individual
producer
and
exchanger
these
laws
are
strange
and
often
unknown
forces
the
nature
of
which
must
be
laboriously
investigated
and
ascertained
these
economic
laws
of
production
are
modified
by
the
different
stages
of
this
form
of
production
but
generally
speaking
the
entire
period
of
civilization
is
dominated
by
these
laws
to
this
day
the
product
controls
the
producer
to
this
day
the
aggregate
production
of
society
is
managed
not
on
a
uniform
plan
but
by
blind
laws
that
rule
with
elementary
force
and
find
their
final
expression
in
the
storms
of
periodical
commercial
crises
we
have
seen
that
human
labor
power
is
enabled
at
a
very
early
stage
of
production
to
produce
considerably
more
than
is
needed
to
maintain
the
producer
we
have
found
that
this
stage
coïncided
in
general
with
the
first
appearance
of
the
division
of
labor
and
of
exchange
between
individuals
now
it
was
not
long
before
the
great
truth
was
discovered
that
man
may
himself
be
a
commodity
and
that
human
labor
power
may
be
exchanged
and
exploited
by
transforming
a
man
into
a
slave
hardly
had
exchange
between
men
been
established
when
men
themselves
were
also
exchanged
the
active
asset
became
a
passive
liability
whether
man
wanted
it
or
not
slavery
which
reaches
its
highest
development
in
civilization
introduced
the
first
great
division
of
an
exploited
and
an
exploiting
class
into
society
this
division
continued
during
the
whole
period
of
civilization
slavery
is
the
first
form
of
exploitation
characteristic
of
the
antique
world
then
followed
feudalism
in
the
middle
ages
and
wage
labor
in
recent
times
these
are
the
three
great
forms
of
servitude
characteristic
of
the
three
great
epochs
of
civilization
their
invariable
mark
is
either
open
or
in
modern
times
disguised
slavery
the
stage
of
commodity
production
introducing
civilization
is
marked
economically
by
the
introduction
of
metal
coins
and
thus
of
money
as
capital
of
interest
and
of
usury
merchants
as
middlemen
between
producers
private
property
and
mortgage
slave
labor
as
the
prevailing
form
of
production
the
form
of
the
family
corresponding
to
civilization
and
becoming
its
pronounced
custom
is
monogamy
the
supremacy
of
man
over
woman
and
the
monogamous
family
as
the
economic
unit
of
society
the
aggregation
of
civilized
society
is
the
state
which
throughout
all
typical
periods
is
the
state
of
the
ruling
class
and
in
all
cases
mainly
a
machine
for
controlling
the
oppressed
and
exploited
class
civilization
is
furthermore
characterized
on
one
side
by
the
permanent
introduction
of
the
contrast
between
city
and
country
as
the
basis
of
the
entire
division
of
social
labor
on
the
other
side
by
the
introduction
of
the
testament
by
which
the
property
holder
is
enabled
to
dispose
of
his
property
beyond
the
hour
of
his
death
this
institution
is
a
direct
blow
at
the
gentile
constitution
and
was
unknown
in
athens
until
the
time
of
solon
in
rome
it
was
introduced
very
early
but
we
do
not
know
when
in
germany
it
was
originated
by
the
priests
in
order
that
the
honest
german
might
bequeath
his
property
to
the
church
without
any
interference
with
this
fundamental
constitution
civilization
had
accomplished
things
for
which
the
old
gentile
society
was
no
match
whatever
but
these
exploits
were
accomplished
by
playing
on
the
most
sordid
passions
and
instincts
of
man
and
by
developing
them
at
the
expense
of
all
his
other
gifts
barefaced
covetousness
was
the
moving
spirit
of
civilization
from
its
first
dawn
to
the
present
day
wealth
and
again
wealth
and
for
the
third
time
wealth
wealth
not
of
society
but
of
the
puny
individual
was
its
only
and
final
aim
if
nevertheless
the
advanced
development
of
science
and
at
repeated
times
the
highest
flower
of
art
fell
into
its
lap
this
was
only
due
to
the
fact
that
without
them
the
highest
emoluments
of
modern
wealth
would
have
been
missing
exploitation
of
one
class
by
another
being
the
basis
of
civilization
its
whole
development
involves
a
continual
contradiction
every
progress
of
production
is
at
the
same
time
a
retrogression
in
the
condition
of
the
oppressed
class
that
is
of
the
great
majority
every
benefit
for
one
class
is
necessarily
an
evil
for
the
other
every
new
emancipation
of
one
class
a
new
oppression
for
the
other
the
most
drastic
proof
of
this
is
furnished
by
the
introduction
of
machinery
the
effects
of
which
are
well
known
and
while
there
is
hardly
any
distinction
between
rights
and
duties
among
barbarians
as
we
have
seen
civilization
makes
the
difference
between
these
two
plain
even
to
the
dullest
mind
for
now
one
class
has
nearly
all
the
rights
the
other
class
nearly
all
the
duties
but
this
is
not
admitted
what
is
good
for
the
ruling
class
is
alleged
to
be
good
for
the
whole
of
society
with
which
the
ruling
class
identifies
itself
the
more
civilization
advances
the
more
it
is
found
to
cover
with
the
cloak
of
charity
the
evils
necessarily
created
by
it
to
excuse
them
or
to
deny
their
existence
in
short
to
introduce
a
conventional
hypocrisy
that
culminates
in
the
declaration
the
exploitation
of
the
oppressed
class
is
carried
on
by
the
exploiting
class
solely
in
the
interest
of
the
exploited
class
itself
and
if
the
latter
does
not
recognize
this
but
even
becomes
rebellious
it
is
simply
the
worst
ingratitude
to
its
benefactors
the
exploiters
and
now
in
conclusion
let
me
add
morgan
judgment
of
civilization
ancient
society
page
since
the
advent
of
civilization
the
outgrowth
of
property
has
been
so
immense
its
forms
so
diversified
its
uses
so
expanding
and
its
management
so
intelligent
in
the
interest
of
its
owners
that
it
has
become
on
the
part
of
the
people
an
unmanageable
power
the
human
mind
stands
bewildered
in
the
presence
of
its
own
creation
the
time
will
come
nevertheless
when
human
intelligence
will
rise
to
the
mastery
over
property
and
define
the
relations
of
the
state
to
the
property
it
protects
as
well
as
the
obligations
and
the
limits
of
the
rights
of
its
owners
the
interests
of
society
are
paramount
to
individual
interests
and
the
two
must
be
brought
into
just
and
harmonious
relations
a
mere
property
career
is
not
the
final
destiny
of
mankind
if
progress
is
to
be
the
law
of
the
future
as
it
has
been
of
the
past
the
time
which
has
passed
away
since
civilization
began
is
but
a
fragment
of
the
past
duration
of
man
existence
and
but
a
fragment
of
the
ages
yet
to
come
the
dissolution
of
society
bids
fair
to
become
the
termination
of
a
career
of
which
property
is
the
end
and
aim
because
such
a
career
contains
the
elements
of
democracy
in
government
brotherhood
in
society
equality
in
rights
and
privileges
and
universal
education
foreshadow
the
next
higher
plane
of
society
to
which
experience
intelligence
and
knowledge
are
steadily
tending
it
will
be
a
revival
in
a
higher
form
of
the
liberty
equality
and
fraternity

lassalle
system
of

argues
in
its
second
part
mainly
the
proposition
that
the
roman

is
as
old
as
rome
itself
and
that
there
has
never
been
in
roman
history
a
time
without
a
testament
according
to
him
the
testament
had
its
origin
in

lassalle
as
a
convinced
hegelian
of
the
old
school
derives
the
provisions
of
the
roman
law
not
from
the
social
condition
of
the
romans
but
from
the
speculative
conception
of
will
and
thus
arrives
at
this
totally
conclusion
this
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
in
a
book
that
draws
from
the
same
speculative
conception
the
conclusion
that
the
transfer
of

was
purely
a
side
issue
