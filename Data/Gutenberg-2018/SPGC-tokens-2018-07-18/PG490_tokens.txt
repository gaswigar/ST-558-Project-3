life
and
adventures
of
calamity
jane
by
herself
my
maiden
name
was
marthy
cannary
i
was
born
in
princeton
missourri
may
father
and
mother
were
natives
of
ohio
i
had
two
brothers
and
three
sisters
i
being
the
oldest
of
the
children
as
a
child
i
always
had
a
fondness
for
adventure
and
exercise
and
especial
fondness
for
horses
which
i
began
to
ride
at
an
early
age
and
continued
to
do
so
until
i
became
an
expert
rider
being
able
to
ride
the
most
vicious
and
stubborn
of
horses
in
fact
the
greater
portion
of
my
life
in
early
times
was
spent
in
this
manner
in
we
emigrated
from
our
homes
in
missourri
by
the
overland
route
to
virginia
city
montana
taking
five
months
to
make
the
journey
while
on
the
way
the
greater
portion
of
my
time
was
spent
in
hunting
along
with
the
men
and
hunters
of
the
party
in
fact
i
was
at
all
times
with
the
men
when
there
was
excitement
and
adventures
to
be
had
by
the
time
we
reached
virginia
city
i
was
considered
a
remarkable
good
shot
and
a
fearless
rider
for
a
girl
of
my
age
i
remember
many
occurrences
on
the
journey
from
missourri
to
montana
many
times
in
crossing
the
mountains
the
conditions
of
the
trail
were
so
bad
that
we
frequently
had
to
lower
the
wagons
over
ledges
by
hand
with
ropes
for
they
were
so
rough
and
rugged
that
horses
were
of
no
use
we
also
had
many
exciting
times
fording
streams
for
many
of
the
streams
in
our
way
were
noted
for
quicksands
and
boggy
places
where
unless
we
were
very
careful
we
would
have
lost
horses
and
all
then
we
had
many
dangers
to
encounter
in
the
way
of
streams
swelling
on
account
of
heavy
rains
on
occasions
of
that
kind
the
men
would
usually
select
the
best
places
to
cross
the
streams
myself
on
more
than
one
occasion
have
mounted
my
pony
and
swam
across
the
stream
several
times
merely
to
amuse
myself
and
have
had
many
narow
escapes
from
having
both
myself
and
pony
washed
away
to
certain
death
but
as
the
pioneers
of
those
days
had
plenty
of
courage
we
overcame
all
obstacles
and
reached
virginia
city
in
safety

that
they
carried

the
most
dangerous
route
in
the
hills
but
as
my
reputation
as
a
rider
and
quick
shot
was
well
known
i
was
molested
very
little
for
the
toll
gatherers

on
me
as
being
a
good
fellow
and
they
knew
that
i
never
missed
my
mark
i
made
the
round
trip
every
two
days
which
was
considered
pretty
good
riding
in
that
country
remained

that
summer
visiting
all
the
camps
within
an
area
of
one
hundred

throw
up
his
hands
through
the
excitement
on
hearing
of
bill
death
having
left
my
weapons
on
the
post
of
my
bed
he
was
then
taken
to
a
log
cabin
and
locked
up
well
secured
as
every
one
thought
but
he
got
away
and
was
afterwards

wite
then

this

done
with

were
anxious

several
gentlemen
from
eastern
cities
who
advised
me
to
allow
myself
to
be
placed
before
the
public
in
such
a
manner
as
to
give
the
people
of
the
eastern

opportunity
