chapter
i
a
stranger
comes
to
town
tor
was
hungry
hunger
was
a
common
experience
in
tor
s
short
life
he
merely
tightened
the
dingy
rags
about
his
middle
and
continued
to
stare
at
the
group
of
sparrows
quarreling
noisily
in
the
red
dust
of
the
street
it
had
occurred
to
tor
that
the
life
of
a
sparrow
must
be
vastly
pleasanter
than
that
of
a
boy
they
find
plenty
to
eat
he
told
himself
enviously
as
he
hugged
his
lean
little
body
with
a
sudden
impulse
the
child
flung
a
pebble
into
the
midst
of
the
belligerents
the
birds
shook
the
dust
from
their
ruffled
feathers
with
noisy
clamor
of
dismay
darted
into
the
bright
air
and
disappeared
far
above
the
tops
of
the
tallest
houses
tor
laughed
aloud
as
a
second
idea
struggled
with
the
first
in
his
clouded
brain
then
he
checked
himself
thoughtfully
and
winding
his
rags
more
closely
about
him
trotted
noiselessly
away
down
the
street
chelluh
the
blind
beggar
for
more
years
than
one
could
count
on
the
fingers
of
both
hands
the
undisputed
proprietor
of
a
snug
corner
just
within
the
damascus
gate
was
shaking
his
brazen
cup
after
his
daily
custom
the
cup
rattled
bravely
for
certain
coins
had
already
been
dropped
therein
by
the
charitable
have
mercy
kind
lords
of
jerusalem
have
mercy
on
the
sorrows
of
one
born
blind
chanted
the
beggar
in
his
whining
monotone
kind
lords
beautiful
ladies
only
a
denarius
i
beseech
of
you
and
may
the
blessings
of
the
blind
man
paused
his
quick
ear
catching
the
sound
of
a
hesitating
footfall
amid
the
hurrying
steps
which
passed
in
and
out
at
the
open
gate
now
may
jove
jehovah
and
all
lesser
gods
be
gracious
unto
thee
noble
sir
he
began
on
a
sudden
this
professional
plaint
broke
into
a
bellow
of
anger
and
alarm
help
thieves
murder
he
cried
my
money
some
one
has
stolen
my
money
no
one
appearing
to
pay
the
slightest
heed
to
his
outcries
the
beggar
beat
upon
the
ground
in
a
very
fury
of
impotent
rage
tor
standing
well
out
of
range
of
the
whirling
staff
regarded
the
blind
man
with
a
pleased
smile
for
the
moment
he
had
quite
forgotten
that
he
was
hungry
aha
my
very
good
master
he
cried
tauntingly
and
who
is
it
who
will
fast
and
perchance
at
sound
of
the
shrill
childish
voice
the
beggar
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
vile
imprecation
is
it
thou
spawn
of
the
dust
who
hast
dared
rob
me
he
screamed
making
a
vicious
rush
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
come
hither
that
i
may
break
every
bone
of
thy
thieving
body
what
if
i
choose
not
to
be
beaten
inquired
tor
coolly
evading
the
groping
fingers
of
the
beggar
what
if
i
will
to
exchange
thy
good
coin
for
bread
yesterday
thou
gav
st
me
naught
save
a
beating
i
have
had
but
a
bellyful
of
curses
i
tell
thee
i
will
serve
thee
no
longer
may
jove
jehovah
and
all
lesser
gods
be
gracious
unto
thee
with
this
mocking
farewell
the
boy
darted
away
and
being
for
the
moment
almost
as
unseeing
as
his
late
master
by
reason
of
the
hunger
which
tore
him
urgently
ran
straight
into
the
arms
of
a
man
who
had
been
curiously
watching
the
scene
from
the
shelter
of
an
archway
let
me
go
shrieked
tor
striving
with
all
his
puny
strength
to
writhe
out
of
the
powerful
grasp
of
his
captor
let
me
go
i
say
then
like
the
little
animal
that
he
was
he
twisted
about
and
buried
his
sharp
white
teeth
in
the
brown
hand
that
held
him
ouf
verily
thou
art
a
cried
the
stranger
lightly
cuffing
the
child
s
ears
hold
hard
small
one
till
i
find
how
thy
matters
lie
with
the
fellow
give
the
lad
into
the
hand
of
his
lawful
master
and
may
heaven
reward
thee
noble
sir
cried
chelluh
making
his
way
rapidly
toward
the
two
with
the
aid
of
his
staff
the
boy
is
that
i
should
have
begotten
such
an
undutiful
one
yet
because
of
mine
am
helpless
as
thou
but
give
him
into
my
hand
and
i
will
speedily
requite
him
for
robbing
me
of
my
last
didst
thou
steal
his
money
boy
asked
the
stranger
stooping
to
look
into
the
child
s
pinched
face
yes
said
tor
his
big
bright
eyes
fixed
upon
the
beggar
in
manifest
terror
i
was
hungry
let
me
go
or
i
will
ah
little
dog
thy
teeth
shall
be
broken
for
that
word
mumbled
the
beggar
feeling
after
the
child
with
a
ferocious
chuckle
give
him
to
not
so
fast
friend
not
so
fast
said
the
stranger
quietly
drawing
the
boy
away
from
the
grimy
talons
outstretched
to
seize
him
this
is
thy
son
sayst
thou
why
then
is
the
child
starving
and
naked
whilst
thou
art
sleek
and
well
covered
why
is
he
bruised
and
bleeding
like
the
dog
thou
didst
call
him
whilst
thou
art
whole
the
beggar
bared
his
yellow
teeth
in
a
malevolent
smile
why
herein
is
a
marvel
he
said
softly
a
noble
thy
speech
betrayeth
thee
kind
to
jerusalem
for
the
passover
perchance
for
love
for
gods
alone
know
thine
delaying
his
so
honorable
affairs
his
so
important
business
to
look
to
a
blind
beggar
s
brat
sacred
fire
but
i
am
bowed
to
the
earth
before
thy
most
noble
condescension
who
am
not
worthy
to
touch
the
hem
of
thy
honorable
garment
i
have
said
that
the
boy
is
mine
if
he
be
hungry
if
he
be
naked
if
he
be
is
that
to
a
stranger
from
galilee
truly
he
is
but
a
dog
of
the
gutters
but
even
a
dog
hath
eyes
and
may
be
useful
to
one
in
my
wilt
thou
that
i
give
thee
into
the
hand
of
thy
father
asked
the
galilean
of
the
child
who
no
longer
struggled
to
free
himself
the
man
is
not
my
father
mumbled
tor
hopelessly
he
will
kill
thou
liest
my
son
after
thy
custom
put
in
chelluh
with
a
triumphant
chuckle
it
is
easy
to
and
there
is
no
one
to
say
me
but
not
profitable
i
shall
but
chasten
thee
for
thy
profit
as
is
enjoined
upon
every
son
of
abraham
permit
me
to
salute
thee
most
honorable
stranger
tis
already
over
long
that
we
keep
thee
from
thy
son
and
and
leaning
forward
as
if
to
humbly
kiss
the
stranger
s
robe
the
beggar
laid
violent
hands
on
the
trembling
child
oho
i
have
my
fingers
on
thee
at
last
rat
of
the
gutter
come
now
and
we
will
settle
our
matters
five
denarii
it
was
of
the
temple
what
now
the
stranger
had
forcibly
relaxed
the
clutch
of
the
bony
fingers
here
is
thy
money
he
said
counting
out
from
his
broad
palm
the
coins
which
the
child
passed
over
to
him
with
a
look
of
piteous
appeal
five
denarii
saidst
thou
as
for
the
lad
if
he
hath
the
proper
love
for
thee
he
will
doubtless
return
fast
enough
when
thou
art
in
kindlier
temper
if
not
thou
art
relieved
of
his
keep
come
with
me
boy
if
thou
wouldst
thou
art
a
swine
screamed
the
beggar
dost
hear
me
galilean
a
thy
father
also
and
the
father
of
thy
father
thy
fire
help
help
the
beggar
lay
sprawling
in
the
dust
under
a
blow
from
the
galilean
s
powerful
fist
the
stranger
stood
over
him
breathing
deep
his
dark
eyes
flashing
baleful
fire
then
shrugging
his
shoulders
slightly
and
muttering
certain
strange
words
under
his
breath
he
stooped
picked
up
the
beggar
quite
gently
and
set
him
in
his
place
here
is
thy
staff
thy
cup
and
thy
money
friend
he
said
calmly
ignoring
the
torrent
of
imprecation
which
issued
from
the
open
month
of
the
beggar
like
a
foul
stream
my
master
hath
taught
me
that
even
such
refuse
as
thou
must
be
handled
with
love
but
hark
ye
fellow
no
man
may
defile
the
name
of
my
mother
and
stand
before
peter
the
the
beggar
strained
his
sightless
eyes
after
the
departing
footfalls
peter
the
fisherman
he
repeated
with
a
ferocious
smile
ah
most
honorable
and
benefactor
i
humbly
thank
thy
noble
honor
for
relating
to
me
thy
name
may
jove
jehovah
and
all
lesser
deities
enable
me
to
suitably
requite
the
man
and
i
will
offer
of
my
gains
a
yearling
lamb
no
less
i
will

swear
chapter
ii
a
sparrow
falleth
the
galilean
having
thus
made
for
himself
an
enemy
plunged
into
one
of
the
narrow
streets
leading
toward
the
temple
he
was
still
breathing
deep
and
thrust
his
pilgrim
s
staff
fiercely
into
the
red
dust
of
the
gloomy
thoroughfare
who
am
i
that
i
should
follow
a
prophet
he
demanded
of
himself
angrily
if
thine
enemy
smite
thee
smite
not
thou
again
saith
my
master
and
behold
i
have
smitten
a
stranger
and
one
born
blind
verily
i
am
glad
that
the
nazarene
did
not
see
me
do
it
hold
i
had
forgotten
the
boy
he
stopped
short
and
presently
spied
tor
s
small
head
running
over
with
sunburnt
curls
peeping
out
from
the
shelter
of
a
projecting
archway
the
boy
s
wild
bright
eyes
met
his
own
defiantly
thou
lt
not
catch
me
a
second
time
the
man
s
white
teeth
flashed
in
a
quick
answering
smile
he
who
is
once
bitten
by
a
wolf
s
whelp
in
future
remembers
and
is
did
i
bite
thee
to
bleeding
galilean
aye
verily
look
thou
at
my
tor
laughed
aloud
it
is
well
he
said
briefly
nay
it
is
not
well
tis
an
evil
thing
for
a
child
to
bite
like
a
dog
wilt
thou
eat
with
me
small
one
i
bite
like
a
dog
because
i
hate
like
a
dog
and
hunger
like
a
dog
replied
tor
slowly
i
stole
from
the
beggar
and
thou
didst
take
the
money
from
me
by
force
which
is
better
nay
galilean
i
will
not
eat
with
the
stranger
sat
down
upon
a
stone
with
an
air
of
indifference
i
am
hungry
he
said
and
producing
a
brown
loaf
and
a
handful
of
olives
from
his
pouch
began
to
eat
little
by
little
the
child
crept
nearer
presently
he
stretched
out
one
puny
hand
and
snatched
a
fragment
of
bread
which
the
man
carelessly
let
fall
ah
thou
said
the
galilean
with
an
air
of
surprise
and
let
fall
another
bit
later
he
placed
a
large
piece
of
the
bread
on
the
stone
at
his
side
and
looked
away
at
the
tops
of
the
houses
does
the
hand
that
bleeds
hurt
thee
over
much
stranger
inquired
a
small
voice
at
his
elbow
does
a
hand
that
is
wounded
to
bleeding
hurt
repeated
the
galilean
gravely
verily
the
smart
is
grievous
art
satisfied
why
didst
thou
hold
me
when
i
would
not
inquired
the
child
was
my
doing
any
business
of
thine
the
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
nay
he
replied
doggedly
it
was
not
moreover
i
should
have
been
attending
to
the
beam
in
mine
own
eye
i
have
been
taught
to
forbear
for
a
just
cause
i
am
already
punished
and
shall
be
punished
again
bray
a
fool
in
a
mortar
sayeth
the
wise
solomon
yet
will
his
folly
not
depart
from
such
a
fool
am
who
told
thee
it
was
an
evil
thing
to
fight
galilean
asked
the
boy
curiously
he
was
sitting
quite
confidently
now
at
the
stranger
s
side
munching
bread
and
olives
i
say
it
is
not
is
unless
one
is
beaten
then
indeed
it
is
evil
but
one
may
always
curse
another
i
have
learned
divers
strong
i
am
able
to
curse
a
man
or
a
beast
in
many
i
have
a
master
one
jesus
of
nazareth
said
the
galilean
slowly
he
tells
me
that
i
must
allow
a
man
who
has
smitten
me
on
one
cheek
to
smite
the
other
of
course
after
thou
hast
smitten
thine
enemy
soundly
he
will
smite
thee
again
if
he
is
able
is
thy
master
a
gladiator
god
forbid
murmured
the
galilean
he
stared
thoughtfully
at
the
famished
child
who
was
devouring
the
last
crumbs
of
bread
art
thou
filled
he
asked
tor
shrugged
his
thin
shoulders
is
the
dry
bed
of
kedron
filled
with
a
single
shower
he
inquired
tersely
i
have
eaten
he
stopped
short
and
fixed
his
bright
eyes
on
the
galilean
s
hurt
hand
which
he
had
thrust
into
a
fold
of
his
tunic
let
me
see
it
he
added
timidly
wherefore
wouldst
thou
again
whet
thy
teeth
on
me
tor
shook
his
head
it
hurts
me
also
now
that
i
have
eaten
thy
bread
he
faltered
then
to
the
immense
astonishment
of
the
man
he
burst
into
a
passion
of
weeping
his
rough
head
bowed
upon
his
scarred
knees
an
looking
dog
which
had
been
hungrily
watching
the
scene
from
an
angle
in
the
wall
skulked
rapidly
toward
the
child
and
thrust
his
lean
carcass
between
the
two
the
galilean
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
muttered
imprecation
and
threatening
staff
stop
cried
tor
in
sudden
fury
tis
my
dog
tis
baladan
thou
shalt
not
strike
him
the
man
looked
on
in
horrified
amazement
while
the
child
wound
his
thin
arms
about
the
shaggy
neck
of
the
brute
murmuring
gently
see
here
is
yet
a
bit
of
bread
for
thee
good
baladan
eat
my
friend
eat
it
is
good
the
dog
licked
the
child
s
bare
feet
and
whined
his
delight
didst
thou
not
know
boy
that
dogs
are
unclean
and
evil
brutes
demanded
the
galilean
with
an
air
of
profound
disgust
nay
thou
art
thyself
unclean
and
evil
and
i
must
away
to
my
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
child
and
strode
away
his
head
bent
his
eyes
fixed
gloomily
upon
the
ground
tor
watched
him
furtively
then
with
a
word
to
the
dog
which
obediently
slunk
back
into
his
chosen
lair
he
trotted
noiselessly
after
the
man
i
will
see
where
the
stranger
goes
he
told
himself
the
child
had
not
followed
the
galilean
far
when
the
dull
rumbling
of
and
the
sharp
crack
of
a
whip
warned
him
out
of
the
narrow
thoroughfare
he
flattened
himself
against
a
convenient
wall
and
stared
greedily
at
the
sight
this
could
be
no
less
than
a
roman
official
of
high
rank
the
boy
knew
it
right
well
his
eyes
roved
eagerly
over
the
rich
appointments
of
the
chariot
and
fastened
inquiringly
on
the
frowning
face
of
the
man
who
guided
the
plunging
horses
a
second
man
stood
at
the
driver
s
side
a
man
wearing
a
tunic
and
toga
richly
bordered
with
the
imperial
purple
tor
drew
his
breath
sharply
in
pleased
astonishment
then
he
saw
that
the
chariot
was
hotly
pursued
by
a
crowd
of
gamins
like
himself
tis
the

the
man
who
opened
his
eyes
to
tor
groaning
in
the
wordless
anguish
of
his
hurts
came
a
soft
inquiring
touch
on
his
heaving
shoulders
led
by
that
kind
instinct
which
guides
all
wounded
creatures
the
child
had
crawled
away
and
hidden
himself
from
unfriendly
eyes
in
the
mouth
of
a
ruinous
sewer
hard
by
here
he
had
lain
long
hours
exhausted
with
agony
the
dog
snuffed
the
small
huddled
figure
from
head
to
foot
with
short
anxious
whines
then
he
fell
to
industriously
licking
the
one
limp
brown
hand
which
crept
out
from
beneath
the
ragged
tunic
baladan
whispered
tor
and
shrieked
aloud
with
the
intolerable
smart
of
rising
tears
in
his
blinded
eyes
the
shriek
faint
as
it
was
reached
the
ears
of
a
second
boy
who
was
searching
carefully
from
side
to
side
of
the
gloomy
little
thoroughfare
tis
thou
tor
he
exclaimed
stooping
to
stare
in
at
the
sewer
s
mouth
art
bad
hurt
oh
dan
the
accursed
lash
of
the
roman
smote
my
eyes
groaned
the
child
and
sputtered
out
some
strange
maledictions
in
the
egyptian
tongue
which
he
had
learned
from
his
late
master
the
second
boy
pursed
up
his
coarse
lips
into
a
soft
whistle
of
comprehension
then
he
bent
down
and
stared
briefly
into
the
drooped
face
of
the
sufferer
body
of
bacchus
he
murmured
smiting
his
bare
thigh
with
closed
fist
one
more
blind
beggar
in
then
raising
his
fingers
to
his
lips
he
gave
vent
to
a
shrill
cry
of
summons
it
was
promptly
answered
by
the
soft
thud
of
a
s
feet
and
the
loud
tinkle
of
his
brazen
cups
give
him
to
drink
commanded
dan
indicating
tor
with
a
grimy
forefinger
the
poor
fool
hath
brought
upon
himself

the
evil
eye
of
a
with
that
he
produced
a
copper
coin
which
the
acknowledged
with
a
cup
of
water
from
the
on
his
back
i
will
come
again
at
sunset
and
give
him
to
drink
said
the
carrier
with
a
sidelong
glance
of
fear
and
pity
then
the
two
departed
leaving
tor
to
his
misery
how
the
child
lived
through
the
days
and
weeks
that
followed
only
baladan
knew
the
dog
warmed
his
master
s
pinched
body
at
night
keeping
at
bay
other
prowling
beasts
of
the
pariah
race
which
ranged
the
deserted
streets
as
lawless
and
almost
as
fierce
as
wolves
he
even
fed
him
more
than
once
bringing
fragments
of
bread
and
fish
stolen
from
a
vender
s
stall
at
the
imminent
peril
of
his
life
occasionally
the
friendly
visited
the
suffering
boy
and
the
little
wild
children
of
the
street
swarming
like
sparrows
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
shared
their
infrequent
crusts
with
him
by
slow
degrees
the
anguish
of
his
wounds
grew
less
poignant
the
cruelly
disfigured
eyes
were
indeed
wholly
darkened
but
they
ceased
to
send
burning
shafts
of
fire
to
the
tortured
brain
the
child
slept
fitfully
ate
what
he
could
get
and
one
day
even
smiled
this
when
baladan
brought
him
a
meatless
bone
laying
it
down
at
his
feet
with
extravagant
expressions
of
satisfaction
nay
good
baladan
murmured
tor
patting
his
friend
s
shaggy
coat
indeed
i
am
not
hungry
eat
dear
beast
and
he
thrust
the
bone
into
the
dog
s
mouth
and
closed
his
sharp
teeth
upon
it
baladan
understood
and
the
two
rested
together
in
the
sunshine
with
something
like
real
content
the
charitable
had
bestowed
one
of
his
brazen
cups
upon
the
blind
boy
and
this
with
his
ruined
eyes
became
his
stock
in
trade
little
by
little
he
learned
to
send
forth
the
dolorous
plaint
of
the
blind
mendicant
after
a
time
he
could
find
his
way
from
place
to
place
with
the
aid
of
the
dog
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
one
more
blind
beggar
in
jerusalem
once
during
these
evil
days
of
his
darkness
tor
fell
in
with
his
old
master
it
was
on
this
wise
the
child
grown
bolder
had
made
his
way
farther
than
his
wont
into
the
more
crowded
thoroughfares
of
the
city
and
there
his
shrill
cry
for
alms
sounded
loud
and
clear
above
the
tumult
of
the
he
rattled
his
cup
bravely
as
was
the
custom
of
the
professional
beggar
sending
forth
into
the
unfriendly
world
the
old
familiar
plaint
of
the
beggar
chelluh
have
mercy
kind
lords
of
jerusalem
have
mercy
on
the
sorrows
of
one
born
blind
kind
lord
kind
lady
only
a
denarius
i
beseech
thee
and
may
jehovah
and
all
lesser
gods
be
gracious
unto
thee
now
it
chanced
that
chelluh
himself
had
also
come
to
the
to
beg
alms
and
hearing
the
child
s
voice
afar
off
recognized
it
with
the
unerring
ear
of
the
blind
fetch
me
now
to
the
voice
that
crieth
my
cry
he
commanded
the
one
that
led
him
and
when
presently
he
was
come
to
the
place
where
tor
stood
in
the
safe
angle
of
two
windowless
walls
he
stopped
short
with
a
malevolent
smile
art
thou
of
a
surety
blind
my
thou
stealest
my
cry
for
alms
as
thou
didst
once
steal
my
money
he
demanded
tor
trembled
like
a
leaf
in
the
wind
at
sound
of
the
cruel
voice
alas
i
am
indeed
blind
good
master
he
said
beseechingly
have
mercy
upon
me
for
the
prayer
ended
in
a
muffled
shriek
for
help
as
the
blind
man
hurled
himself
upon
the
blind
child
griping
him
in
a
very
fury
of
malicious
hatred
no
one
interfered
what
indeed
was
the
quarrel
of
two
beggars
in
an
angle
of
the
wall
trade
pressed
hard
in
jerusalem
as
elsewhere
and
a
man
must
mind
naught
save
his
own
business
if
he
would
prosper
so
no
one
glanced
that
way
when
the
blind
man
having
satisfied
his
lust
for
revenge
departed
leaving
the
child
s
limp
body
upon
the
ground
tor
was
not
dead
he
was
only
bruised
and
beaten
and
choked
into
insensibility
and
after
awhile
he
revived
and
crawled
feebly
away
with
the
faithful
baladan
his
was
gone
and
he
no
longer
dared
to
raise
his
voice
to
crave
alms
from
the
occasionally
one
tossed
him
a
coin
or
a
crust
but
for
the
most
part
the
child
crouched
all
day
in
his
corner
motionless
starving
and
the
days
and
weeks
dragged
by
he
was
sitting
thus
one
morning
when
the
sun
had
climbed
high
enough
to
flood
his
darkened
nook
with
yellow
light
tor
could
feel
the
warmth
of
its
radiance
in
his
chill
darkness
he
sighed
deeply
and
spread
forth
his
lean
hands
wondering
dully
what
it
would
be
like
to
see
once
more
he
had
already
forgotten
the
blue
sky
and
the
moving
clouds
the
flutter
of
green
leaves
over
high
garden
walls
and
the
glistening
whir
of
in
the
sunshine
his
night
was
endless
unbroken
by
morning
gleam
or
noontide
glory
it
meant
cold
and
hunger
and
a
thousand
nameless
miseries
which
he
endured
because
he
must
endure
it
would
stretch
on
and
on
he
thought
to
some
hopeless
end
when
perchance
he
might
sleep
to
awaken
no
more
tor
had
looked
upon
such
sleepers
with
a
scared
creeping
of
the
flesh
in
the
old
days
of
seeing
now
the
sleep
seemed
good
and
quite
stupidly
and
vaguely
he
longed
for
it
somewhere
afar
off
there
was
shouting
and
a
sound
of
voices
that
chanted
musically
the
child
listened
with
the
sharpened
attention
which
had
grown
to
be
his
one
defence
and
solace
in
the
old
days
his
flying
feet
would
have
borne
him
swiftly
enough
to
see
what
was
happening
now
he
could
only
listen
and
wonder
perhaps
tis
some
great
prince
come
to
jerusalem
he
muttered
and
tried
to
picture
to
himself
the
gay
pageant
of
the
marching
troops
the
gorgeous
uniforms
the
jeweled
robes
of
the
nobles
the
chariots
the
horses
and
now
the
shouting
grew
louder
there
was
a
noise
of
feet
of
confused
questions
and
answers
while
above
all
rose
the
clear
musical
voices
of
myriads
of
children
crying
in
the
rhythmic
measures
of
the
temple
chorals
hosanna
to
the
son
of
david
is
the
king
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
hosanna
in
the
highest
tor
started
uncertainly
to
his
feet
a
strange
new
longing
for
something
he
knew
not
what
stealing
into
his
starved
soul
baladan
whined
uneasily
then
running
to
the
and
back
again
to
his
helpless
master
began
to
utter
short
excited
barks
the
child
s
thin
fingers
trailed
the
rough
wall
askingly
his
timid
feet
crept
nearer
to
the
jubilant
procession
to
the
king
hosanna
to
the
son
of
david
he
had
reached
the
open
square
and
fearing
to
go
further
he
sank
down
once
more
in
the
shelter
of
a
friendly
column
hot
tears
stealing
from
his
darkened
eyes
oh
baladan
he
moaned
if
i
could
only
see
and
now
the
sweet
chanting
was
growing
momently
fainter
tor
followed
the
procession
in
fancy
it
was
moving
toward
the
temple
he
knew
great
pile
of
stone
and
marble
and
gold
which
towered
above
the
tumultuous
streets
of
jerusalem
like
the
glistening
palace
of
a
dream
now
it
had
passed
into
the
outer
courts
and
a
great
and
singular
silence
fell
upon
the
city
it
was
broken
after
what
seemed
hours
of
waiting
by
light
and
rapid
footfalls
tor
cried
an
eager
breathless
voice
where
art
thou
here
answered
the
blind
boy
starting
to
his
feet
and
straining
his
sightless
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
here
am
i
what
wilt
thou
dan
for
he
knew
the
voice
and
the
step
of
his
friend
i
have
come
to
fetch
thee
to
the
temple
breathed
the
boy
excitedly
thou
must
come
quickly
before
the
king
has
gone
away
to
his
did
the
king
scatter
coins
among
the
crowd
asked
tor
eagerly

the
soldiers
giving
bread
and
alms
to
the
people
as
when
pilate
came
to
jerusalem
nay
the
man
is
like
no
other
great
one
who
ever
came
to
jerusalem
answered
dan
wonderingly
he
is
verily
a
king
though
didst
thou
not
hear
the
people
shouting
blessed
is
the
king
that
cometh
hark
you
the
man
is
a
strange
king
he
wears
no
crown
no
jewels
he
hath
no
soldiers
no
money
for
the
people
he
came
into
the
city
riding
on
the
colt
of
an
ass
but
the
people
cast
even
their
garments
upon
the
earth
before
him
i
saw
it
and
shouted
with
the
rest
and
because
i
had
no
coat
i
cut
a
green
branch
from
a
tree
and
cast
it
beneath
the
feet
of
his
beast
so
also
did
many
others
when
they
saw
what
i
had
done
they
cut
branches
and
acacias
from
fields
and
gardens
all
along
the
way
twas
a
great
sight
the
big
turbans
came
out
in
a
rage
to
shut
our
mouths
but
for
once
they
could
not
come

come
why
should
i
come
said
tor
mournfully
i

shalt
have
thine
eyes

dan
exultantly
the
king

even
now
laying
his

place

the
two
boys
made
their
way
to
the
temple
enclosure
slipping
easily
among
the
excited
multitudes
unnoticed
even
as
the
little
brown
sparrows
which
flit
among
the
great
feet
of
horses
in
a
crowded
thoroughfare
and
when
they
had
come
to
the
place
where
jesus
was
they
found
already
gathered
great
numbers
of
blind
and
lame
and
withered
and
palsied
and
the
court
ringing
with
the
noise
of
their
petitions

with
the
jubilant
thanksgivings

third
pillar

wilt
see
the
blind
boy
stumbled
on
behind
his
crippled
guide
his
heart
beating
so
loud
in
his
ears
that
he
could
scarce
hear
what
the
voice
said
to
him
but
the
thrilling
touch
on
his
sightless
eyes
sank
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
he
some
one
was
pushing
him
from
behind
tor
yielded
to
the
pressure
without
a
a
sound
his
great
eyes
wide
and
bright
still
remained
fastened
upon
the
man
who
had
healed
him
but
he
uttered
no
sound
of
rejoicing
to

watching
beside
the
third
pillar
came
a
sudden
sickening
sense
of
defeat
he
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
again
laid
forcible
hands
upon

fixed
purpose
formed
and
lifted
itself
like
a
great
radiant
light
in
his
darkened
understanding

aloud

echoed
and
laughed
aloud
then
in
a
sudden
ecstasy
he
leaped
upon
a
balustrade
and
shouted
aloud

word

he
had
heard
afar
off
in
his
darkness

smoke
of

sacrificial
fires

songs

blind
the
maimed
and
palsied
had
gone
away
restored
the
multitude
sated
with
miracle
and
weary
of
shouting
followed
the
nazarene
himself
looking
more
worn
and
thoughtful
than
his
wont
also
departed
with
the
twelve
his
disciples
bearing
themselves
haughtily
under
the
angry
eyes
of
the
priests
at
last
their
master
had
declared
himself
before
the
nation
all
the
city
had
heard
the
royal
acclamation
the
promised
reign
of
the
house
of
david
was
about
to
be
restored
in
jerusalem
already
they
felt
themselves
to
be
princes
and
governors
in
a
kingdom
of
unimagined
splendor
peter
the
galilean
as
he
followed
with
the
others
after
the
pale
potent
worker
of
miracles
who
was
also
a
king
became
aware
of
a
determined
clutch
upon
his
abba
and
looking
down
beheld
with
amazement
and
displeasure
the
small
pinched
face
of
tor
i
have
nothing
for
thee
beggar
he
said
quickly
and
pulled
his
garment
impatiently
away
from
the
child
s
clinging
touch
nay
but
i
am
not
begging
said
tor
in
nowise
abashed
the
he
thy
master
what
is
that
to
thee
frowned
the
future
prince
of
israel
get
thee
gone
the
king
is
the
me
but
now
of
blindness
persisted
the
child
what
is
his
name
nay
i
will
not
loose
thee
till
i
his
name
is
jesus
said
peter
unwillingly
now
i
will
not
said
tor
positively
for
i
also
have
chosen
him
for
my
but
he
loosed
his
hold
on
the
man
s
garment
and
fell
back
a
few
paces
i
shall
follow
him
he
told
himself
simply
just
what
he
expected
from
his
new
master
tor
could
have
told
no
one
he
did
not
put
the
question
to
himself
he
was
again
both
hungry
and
thirsty
but
he
had
cared
little
for
either
hunger
or
thirst
in
his
evil
past
now
he
tightened
the
rags
cheerfully
about
his
middle
in
the
old
familiar
way
and
trotted
noiselessly
after
the
little
group
of
men
in
the
midst
of
which
walked
his
master
the
child
was
trying
dully
to
recall
what
the
galilean
had
said
concerning
this
man
on
the
day
he
had
delivered
him
out
of
the
hand
of
chelluh
by
the
damascus
gate
the
thought
of
chelluh
brought
a
new
purpose
uppermost
when
i
find
a
convenient
season
from
following
my
master
i
will
return
and
beat
the
blind
beggar
even
as
he
beat
me
he
promised
himself
with
a
new
and
savage
joy
in
his
restored
sight
he
that
hath
eyes
is
truly
a
god
and
to
know
this
one
might
well
be
blind
for
a
his
new
master
surrounded
by
his
little
guard
had
passed
quite
out
of
the
city
by
this
time
and
all
were
walking
swiftly
on
one
of
the
level
roman
roads
which
bound
jerusalem
to
its
heathen
emperor
tor
followed
unperceived
in
the
gathering
dusk
of
evening
after
a
little
the
party
reached
a
small
village
entered
it
and
paused
before
a
large
and
beautiful
garden
enclosure
where
they
were
evidently
expected
for
they
were
immediately
admitted
and
the
doors
shut
fast
behind
them
tor
marked
the
place
well
then
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
he
returned
to
jerusalem
found
baladan
and
spent
the
night
in
one
of
his
old
haunts
near
the
damascus
gate
when
the
child
awoke
in
the
morning
the
marvelous
events
of
the
previous
day
floated
before
his
wide
eyes
like
the
misty
fragments
of
a
forgotten
dream
was
i
indeed
blind
he
asked
himself
or
was
that
also
an
evil
dream
of
night
baladan
s
anxious
whine
recalled
him
more
fully
to
his
waking
senses
and
he
sprang
up
to
find
dan
shying
at
him
from
a
neighboring
wall
quoth
the
gamin
discharging
another
volley
of
stones
look
you
lad
there
is
much
to
be
seen
in
jerusalem
indeed
the
man
restored
thy
passover

by
thousands

have
already
begged

briefly
but

master

cried
dan
tossing
his
comrade
a
fragment
of
a
loaf
and
half
a
dozen
olives

a
king

a
merry
life

week
the
pilgrims
are
laden
with
goods
and
one
with
light
fingers
and
lighter
heels
need
lack
the
boy
snapped
his
brown
fingers
and
executed
a
sort
of
savage
dance
in
the
exuberance
of
his
spirits
he
said
do
not
beat
thine
enemy
but
if
thine
enemy
smite
thee
let
him
smite
thee
again
if
he
will
said
tor
munching
his
bread
reflectively
there
is
chelluh
he
hath
beaten
me
not
once
nor
twice
only
but
many
who
said
do
not
smite
thine
enemy
demanded
dan
staring
my
master
said
it
he
said
it
to
the
galilean
not
to
me
i
will
therefore
beat

i
will
steal
his
money
and
give
it
to
my
my
master
mocked
dan
how
dost

that
the
man

have
thee
for
a
servant

but
if
i
will
serve
him
then

he
be
my
master
whether
he
will
or
no
and
i
will
serve
him
i
have
said
how

dan
tor

about
him
reflectively
i
will
bring
him
blind
folks
to
heal
he
said
at
last
i
can
do
thou
art
a
rare
fool
said
dan
conclusively
i
am
off
for
the
pilgrim
encampment
outside
the
walls
look
you
beggar
when
thou
art
through
with
serving
the
king
thy
master
thou
wilt
find
me
there
eating
the
fat
and
drinking
the
sweet
and
with
a
laugh
of
scorn
the
boy
darted
away
left
to
himself
tor
sat
for
a
long
time
deep
in
thought
an
astonishing
picture
had
presented
itself
to
his
mind
born
out
of
the
unseen
whence
cometh
every
good
and
perfect
thing
in
all
the
visible
world
the
child
seemed
to
see
himself
leading
his
old
master
chelluh
to
the
healing
king
and
chelluh
restored
to
sight
crying
hosanna
hosanna
in
the
highest
far
off
and
faint
upon
the
morning
air
a
voice
arose
rising
and
falling
in
dolorous
monotone
tor
knew
it
it
was
the
voice
of
chelluh
begging
alms
he
arose
and
ran
with
swift
feet
to
the
place
which
he
had
hated
and
avoided
even
in
his
dreams
and
there
in
the
familiar
angle
of
the
wall
sat
the
beggar
shaking
his
empty
cup
the
sun
falling
full
upon
his
evil
face
tor
stood
quite
still
and
gazed
at
the
blind
man
with
his
touched
eyes
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
short
life
loving
pity
for
another
welled
up
within
him
master
he
said
in
a
low
voice
then
he
drew
nearer
and
spoke
in
a
louder
voice
he
would
call
no
man
master
save
one
the
blind
beggar
beat
upon
his
cup
with
his
horny
knuckles
who
calls
me
he
asked
scarce
believing
his
truthful
ears
which
told
him
whose
voice
had
spoken
who
calls
me
he
repeated
trembling
i
choked
the
little
dog
to
death
yet
it
is
his
voice
that
thou
didst
not
kill
me
said
tor
i
am
alive
and
see
once
more
yesterday
the
king
my
master
healed
lies
mumbled
chelluh
shaking
his
great
head
thou
wast
always
a
this
is
no
lie
that
i
tell
thee
wouldst
thou
receive
thy
sight
also
come
i
will
lead
thee
to
my
master
he
will
heal
chelluh
reflected
for
a
moment
physically
he
was
stronger
than
the
puny
child
yet
he
distrusted
his
words
thou
art
plotting
mischief
against
me
gutter
rat
he
growled
i
know
if
i
plotted
mischief
i
should
have
come
upon
thee
suddenly
and
run
away
ere
thou
wast
aware
of
me
replied
tor
i
am
no
man
s
fool
but
i
serve
a
new
master
one
jesus
tis
for
my
master
i
do
this
he
heals
blind
folk
therefore
i
fetch
blind
folk
to
him
to
be
healed
thus
i
serve
my
master
wilt
thou
come
chelluh
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
i
will
come
he
said
but
if
thou
hast
lied
to
me
little
dog
thou
knowest
the
strength
of
my
hands
and
shalt
know
again
this
time
i
will
kill
thee
beyond
a
tor
shuddered
at
the
familiar
clutch
of
the
knotted
fingers
on
his
slender
shoulders
yet
he
walked
bravely
forward
so
i
serve
my
master
he
said
aloud
chapter
v
deep
calleth
unto
deep
where
is
the
man
who
heals
the
blind
demanded
chelluh
leaning
heavily
on
the
child
tor
trembled
but
he
answered
boldly
enough
he
will
be
in
the
court
of
the
gentiles
healing
the
there
was
a
great
concourse
of
people
crowding
the
street
which
led
up
to
the
temple
and
amongst
them
numerous
cripples
palsied
men
on
litters
sick
children
in
the
arms
of
anxious
mothers
and
blind
beggars
led
like
chelluh
by
willing
guides
yes
the
king
is
in
the
temple
repeated
tor
confidently
then
he
shouted
hosanna
in
his
shrill
childish
voice
as
he
had
done
the
day
before
the
cry
was
echoed
by
myriads
of
voices
both
far
and
near
chelluh
s
heavy
hand
descended
upon
his
guide
s
curly
head
be
silent
fool
he
hissed
there
is
tumult
ahead
keep
clear
of
the
crowd
i
say
and
look
sharp
they
were
near
the
main
entrance
of
the
temple
now
and
the
stream
of
newcomers
was
met
by
an
excited
mob
of
people
coming
out
imprecations
shouts
and
loud
angry
cries
blended
confusedly
with
the
whir
of
moving
wings
for
a
great
cloud
of
doves
hovered
uncertainly
over
the
place
now
flying
now
settling
on
the
roofs
and
pinnacles
of
the
marble
porticoes
chelluh
stopped
determinedly
and
snuffed
the
air
like
an
animal
what
is
going
on
within
he
demanded
of
tor
the
question
was
answered
by
a
woman
in
a
foreign
who
chanced
to
pause
in
the
crowd
beside
them
the
nazarene
has
thrust
out
the
sellers
of
doves
and
the
from
the
great
court
she
said
laughingly
with
these
eyes
i
saw
it
the
prophet
cast
down
the
tables
with
no
gentle
hand
loosed
the
doves
and
drove
out
the
craven
jews
before
him
like
a
flock
of
frightened
sheep
twas
a
great
sight
also
the
money
was
scattered
all
over
the
court
among
the
multitude
even
i
a
gentile
am
the
richer
for
money
exclaimed
the
blind
beggar
greedily
come
let
us
go
in
i
would
i
had
eyes
that
i
might
glean
of
this
the
man
gives
eyes
also
for
the
asking
said
the
woman
indifferently
i
have
witnessed
miracles
of
healing
till
i
am
weary
of
them
the
jew
is
a
great
magician
surely
but
his
own
countrymen
hate
him
and
the
romans
care
naught
for
miracles
so
betwixt
the
two
he
will
perchance
fall
to
the
tor
was
not
listening
he
was
watching
for
a
good
opening
through
which
to
pilot
his
blind
charge
when
thou
art
healed
thou
wilt
become
a
servant
of
the
king
he
said
softly
in
the
ear
of
the
blind
beggar
ay
and
will
i
sneered
chelluh
and
what
will
i
do
then
fetch
blind
folks
to
be
healed
said
the
child
simply
now
i
see
him
he
added
with
joyful
certainty
do
but
follow
quickly
and
thou
shalt
be
blind
no
longer
like
the
showers
and
sunshine
of
the
father
which
bless
the
good
and
the
evil
alike
through
all
the
years
of
all
the
ages
so
was
the
healing
power
of
him
who
manifested
the
father
in
every
act
of
his
life
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
many
came
to
be
healed
of
blindness
in
those
last
great
days
and
went
away
with
seeing
eyes
and
blind
souls
chelluh
s
first
act
after
receiving
his
sight
was
to
stare
hard
at
tor
i
am
minded
to
know
thee
again
he
said
thoughtfully
the
boy
shivered
beneath
his
gaze
chelluh
with
seeing
eyes
was
even
more
terrible
than
chelluh
blind
those
devouring
eyes
were
roving
like
the
eyes
of
a
beast
of
prey
over
the
excited
crowd
they
fastened
at
last
on
a
man
who
stood
not
far
from
the
nazarene
i
know
that
man
s
voice
said
chelluh
who
and
what
is
he
he
is
a
servant
of
the
king
said
tor
his
name
is
his
name
is
peter
repeated
chelluh
and
struck
his
palms
together
softly
he
turned
and
without
another
word
plunged
into
the
crowd
and
was
gone
tor
forgot
him
presently
he
was
edging
his
way
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
wondrous
voice
jesus
was
teaching
the
people
and
his
words
fell
upon
the
child
s
ignorant
ears
with
a
strange
and
potent
charm
he
could
not
understand
but
he
listened
because
he
loved
and
listening
and
loving
he
comprehended
something
of
what
was
being
said
even
as
a
babe
discerns
the
speech
of
its
mother
love
answereth
love
as
deep
calleth
unto
deep
at
night
tor
followed
his
master
and
the
twelve
when
they
went
forth
out
of
the
city
to
lodge
in
the
house
of
his
friends
in
bethany
this
time
the
child
slept
on
the
ground
in
the
shelter
of
the
garden
wall
begging
a
crust
and
a
cup
of
water
from
one
of
the
villagers
at
dawn
no
one
questioned
the
boy
and
so
he
was
able
again
to
follow
almost
at
their
heels
when
the
little
party
set
out
for
jerusalem
there
was
a
withered
near
the
wayside
and
tor
heard
the
galilean
peter
pause
and
say
to
his
master
rabbi
behold
the
which
thou
cursedst
is
withered
and
jesus
looked
upon
the
withered
tree
and
answered
the
galilean
on
this
wise
have
faith
in
god
for
i
tell
thee
that
whosoever
shall
say
unto
this
mountain
be
thou
taken
up
and
cast
into
the
sea
and
shall
not
doubt
in
his
heart
but
shall
believe
that
what
he
saith
cometh
to
pass
he
shall
have
it
therefore
i
say
unto
you
all
things
whatsoever
ye
pray
and
ask
for
that
ye
have
received
and
ye
shall
have
them
and
whensoever
ye
stand
praying
forgive
if
ye
have
aught
against
any
one
that
your
father
also
which
is
in
heaven
may
forgive
you
your
tor
was
crouching
in
the
shelter
of
a
bush
and
heard
every
word
distinctly
his
thin
face
burned
with
excitement
he
said
whosoever
he
murmured
he
said
tor
knew
something
of
the
custom
of
prayer
many
times
he
had
seen
the
rich
pharisees
standing
motionless
at
the
praying
also
he
had
begged
in
the
temple
court
where
many
persons
prayed
aloud
for
himself
he
never
prayed
the
god
of
the
jews
regarded
not
beggars
he
told
himself
now
as
he
crouched
behind
the
bush
listening
to
the
departing
footsteps
of
the
thirteen
men
he
began
to
say
over
to
himself
the
word
father
which
the
man
who
had
opened
his
eyes
said
so
often
he
repeated
it
softly
to
himself
many
times
then
he
sprang
up
and
followed
hard
after
his
master
vaguely
comforted
and
glad
at
heart
the
day
was
a
long
one
passed
mainly
in
the
great
court
of
the
gentiles
and
tor
mingling
with
every
gaping
crowd
which
surrounded
the
nazarene
was
puzzled
and
troubled
by
much
that
he
saw
and
heard
there
was
no
shouting
of
hosanna
no
royal
acclamations
the
people
stood
close
in
serried
ranks
and
listened
doubtfully
to
the
strange
teachings
of
the
king
in
the
seamless
king
who
wore
no
crown
and
whose
followers
bore
no
arms
he
was
telling
stories
to
the
multitude
stories
so
simple
that
even
a
beggar
could
understand
them
the
child
pressed
close
so
close
that
he
could
have
touched
the
sandaled
feet
of
the
man
who
had
opened
his
eyes
and
so
he
listened
to
the
stories
of
the
father
and
his
two
undutiful
sons
the
absent
lord
of
the
vineyard
and
his
wicked
servants
the
generous
king
who
made
a
marriage
feast
for
his
son
and
how
it
befell
that
the
very
beggars
were
gathered
into
the
feast
the
child
smiled
and
trembled
and
wept
aloud
beneath
the
power
of
that
wondrous
voice
more
than
once
the
master
s
deep
eyes
rested
upon
the
small
upturned
face
with
its
wistful
look
of
adoration
and
once
as
he
was
speaking
the
hand
of
jesus
rested
for
a
moment
on
the
rough
curls
of
the
beggar
s
head
ah
the
rapture
of
that
moment
tor
knew
now
deep
in
his
heart
that
he
was
the
accepted
servant
of
the
king
he
could
have
remained
there
forever
listening
to
the
stories
but
the
temple
police
began
to
clear
away
the
crowd
with
loud
authoritative
cries
and
random
thrusts
of
their
gilded
poles
of
office
make
way
they
shouted
make
way
for
the
holy
and
reverend
chief
priests
and
the
honorable
elders
of
the
sanhedrim
through
the
narrow
passage
thus
cleared
there
came
presently
in
great
pomp
and
glory
a
stately
delegation
from
the
supreme
council
of
the
jewish
hierarchy
the
chief
priests
wished
to
question
publicly
this
worker
of
teller
of
strange
parables
who
openly
wrought
his
mighty
works
in
the
temple
of
jehovah
without
their
will
or
permission
by
what
authority
doest
thou
these
things
they
demanded
and
who
gave
thee
this
authority
and
jesus
calm
and
unafraid
answered
them
after
their
own
custom
with
another
question
i
also
will
ask
you
one
thing
he
said
which
if
ye
tell
me
i
likewise
will
tell
you
by
what
authority
i
do
these
things
the
baptism
of
john
whence
was
it
from
heaven
or
from
men
the
official
who
had
put
the
question
glanced
about
him
at
the
hostile
faces
of
the
multitude
with
a
truculent
air
of
scorn
and
contempt
thus
mumbling
and
stammering
angrily
in
the
midst
of
his
great
beard
he
turned
and
conferred
in
a
whisper
with
his
companions
if
we
say
from
heaven
he
muttered
the
fellow
will
ask
why
then
did
ye
not
believe
him
ay
quoth
another
but
if
we
say
from
men
there
is
the
multitude
to
be
reckoned
with
for
all
hold
that
john
was
a
and
so
they
presently
faced
the
master
their
fierce
eyes
under
the
glittering
insignia
of
the
priestly
office
glaring
at
the
calm
pale
man
of
nazareth
we
know
not
they
said
and
jesus
replied
neither
tell
i
you
by
what
authority
i
do
these
the
priests
withdrew
in
sullen
silence
and
the
telling
of
strange
stories
went
on
but
tor
somehow
swept
from
his
position
by
the
shifting
crowd
found
himself
near
the
defeated
priests
they
had
paused
to
listen
with
the
others
and
were
standing
with
folded
arms
and
sneering
faces
by
one
of
the
great
pillars
of
the
portico
tor
slipped
behind
the
column
of
a
sudden
all
ears
these
men
were
speaking
in
a
half
whisper
of
the
king
his
master
they
hated
him
tor
was
sure
of
it
the
fellow
will
ruin
us
if
we
can
not
stop
his
blatant
mouth
said
one
listen
now
to
his
open
threats
the
kingdom
of
god
shall
be
taken
away
from
you
and
shall
be
given
to
a
nation
bringing
forth
the
fruits
and
he
calleth
himself
our
king
sneered
another
a
pretty
pass
hath
the
chosen
people
come
to
when
the
rabble
choose
a
nazaritish
carpenter
for
king
aha
i
laugh
at
him
tis
no
time
for
mirth
growled
another
the
multitudes
are
ever
agog
for
some
new
thing
stoning
or
crucifixion
is
better
than
laughter
for
such
an
one
hark
you
the
thing
must
be
put
down
and
speedily
i
know
a
way
and
a
man
the
voice
dropped
to
low
whispers
and
tor
trembling
with
vague
fright
and
scarce
knowing
what
he
did
wriggled
his
way
through
the
crowd
toward
the
figure
of
jesus
peter
the
galilean
was
also
talking
excitedly
with
a
man
in
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
tor
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
tall
fisherman
with
some
confidence
i
will
tell
him
he
said
to
himself
and
hovered
expectantly
near
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
speak
he
must
declare
himself
unmistakably
and
at
once
the
small
man
was
saying
with
an
impatient
gesture
this
telling
of
pretty
tales
and
working
of
miracles
has
gone
on
over
long
say
i
we
should
arm
ourselves
and
make
ready
and
the
sanhedrim
must
be
won
over
by
some
great
sign
from
heaven
we
can
do
nothing
without
and
i
say
let
the
master
work
out
his
plans
as
it
pleaseth
him
said
peter
boldly
saw
you
not
his
kingly
air
on
sunday
judas
he
is
every
inch
a
king
i
tell
thee
and
able
to
make
of
us
princes
and
high
and
to
sweep
away
all
oppressors
by
the
word
of
his
able
perhaps
muttered
judas
shaking
his
head
but
i
doubt
him
the
man
careth
nothing
for
for
power
i
know
him
what
are
his
plans
does
any
one
know
them
do
we
who
are
nearest
him
dare
ask
him
he
is
perchance
nothing
more
than
a
dreamer
and
our
ambitions
and
hopes
are
founded
upon
the
shifting
sands
of
his
visions
nay
i
know
what
thou
wouldst
say
simon
but
thou
art
no
patriot
i
hear
the
chosen
people
groaning
in
their
slavery
i
see
the
iron
heel
of
rome
about
to
crush
out
the
last
lingering
life
of
the
nation
will
this
man
save
us
can
he
i
ask
or
is
judas
choked
convulsively
and
tore
at
the
neck
of
his
garment
with
quivering
hands
i
am
half
mad
with
the
torture
of
it
he
groaned
doubt
fear
that
nay
thou
art
a
truculent
and
unbelieving
fellow
at
heart
said
peter
easily
didst
hear
how
the
master
answered
the
priests
but
now
i
could
have
laughed
aloud
to
see
them
slink
away
like
whipped
like
whipped
muttered
the
other
but
they
will
return
anon
like
ravening
wolves
unless
he
declare
himself
tis
he
turned
and
plunged
hastily
into
the
crowd
and
peter
left
to
himself
began
to
smite
his
great
hands
softly
together
he
hath
the
power
to
put
them
all
to
silence
he
said
half
aloud
he
will
do
no
one
fear
i
fear
said
tor
suddenly
speaking
at
the
fisherman
s
elbow
i
what
now
small
one
quoth
peter
staring
down
at
the
child
with
a
displeased
shrug
have
i
not
told
thee
to
keep
thy
distance
yes
but
i
will
not
said
tor
doggedly
listen
galilean
i
heard
the
men
in
long
robes
speak
of
they
hate
him
they
will
kill
him
if
they
can
take
care
of
my
master
can
take
care
of
himself
boy
said
peter
boastfully
he
is
a
king
also
i
am
his
where
is
thy
sword
servant
of
a
king
demanded
tor
eyeing
him
doubtfully
my
sword
stammered
the
fisherman
i
have
no
then
get
one
advised
tor
briefly
chapter
vi
rejected
of
men
the
galilean
shook
his
great
shoulders
doubtfully
as
he
stared
after
the
small
agile
figure
of
the
boy
darting
and
doubling
twisting
and
turning
through
the
huddled
masses
of
people
gathered
about
his
master
by
the
double
he
began
and
stopped
short
with
a
perplexed
frown
swear
not
at
all
saith
my
master
yet
my
unruly
tongue
doth
ever
betray
me
truly
the
tongue
is
a
fire
tamed
by
no
man
not
even
its
there
was
some
new
excitement
brewing
for
the
fisherman
was
thrust
rudely
to
one
side
by
a
guard
of
brawny
temple
police
who
advanced
as
before
crying
out
to
the
people
to
fall
back
in
the
name
of
the
sanhedrim
the
group
of
men
which
followed
close
on
the
heels
of
the
guard
forced
another
profane
exclamation
from
the
unguarded
lips
of
the
galilean
herodians
he
muttered
and
pharisees
now
what
doth
this
portend
the
question
was
answered
by
judas
who
reappeared
at
the
moment
his
dark
face
distorted
by
a
savage
sneer
wouldst
know
why
these
courtiers
of
herod
have
come
to
the
nazarene
fisherman
well
i
can
tell
thee
our
chosen
master
hath
of
late
permitted
himself
to
be
hailed
king
of
the
jews
yet
hath
he
not
pledged
the
nation
to
the
support
of
his
claim
nor
even
armed
us
his
chosen
followers
what
then
herod
is
a
paltry
tetrarch
of
galilee
he
plots
and
schemes
at
rome
for
his
father
s
crown
thou
mayst
know
fisherman
thy
head
be
too
thick
for
the
pretensions
of
the
carpenter
s
son
have
been
widely
noised
abroad
and
have
already
reached
the
ears
of
royal
herod
jesus
of
nazareth
must
take
heed
to
himself
or
he
will
presently
be
dealt
with
after
the
manner
of
john
the
get
thee
behind
me
prophet
of
evil
growled
peter
thou
hast
ever
the
dismal
croak
of
the
raven
what
if
herod
intends
to
acknowledge
jesus
as
the
lawful
descendant
of
david
and
the
promised
messiah
the
tetrarch
is
after
all
a
jew
and
looks
for
the
deliverance
of
judas
laughed
silently
his
narrow
shooting
arrows
of
scorn
at
the
big
fisherman
what
if
the
stones
of
the
temple
should
suddenly
become
armed
troops
for
the
defense
of
our
sapient
master
he
asked
it
might
well
be
so
murmured
peter
thoughtfully
did
he
not
walk
upon
the
sea
did
he
not
control
the
lightnings
and
the
tempest
did
he
not
feed
the
five
thousand
with
one
man
s
victual
hist
now
they
are
speaking
to
him
the
courtiers
of
herod
garbed
as
roman
exquisites
perfumed
and
smiling
were
addressing
themselves
to
the
man
of
nazareth
they
prefaced
their
words
with
extravagant
obeisances
tendered
with
mock
humility
behind
them
stood
the
pharisees
alert
and
watchful
listen
repeated
the
fisherman
his
honest
face
flushed
with
expectancy
we
know
that
thou
art
true
rabbi
began
the
spokesman
of
the
party
and
carest
for
the
opinion
of
no
man
for
thou
regardest
not
the
person
of
men
but
teachest
the
way
of
god
in
truth
is
it
lawful
to
give
tribute
unto
cæsar
or
not
shall
we
give
or
shall
we
not
give
jesus
faced
his
inquisitors
erect
and
calm
his
deep
eyes
searching
their
hypocritical
hearts
there
was
silence
for
a
full
minute
while
the
crowded
listeners
craned
their
necks
for
his
reply
and
judas
clenched
his
knotted
hands
in
a
very
agony
of
suspense
this
was
the
supreme
moment
tribute
to
cæsar
or
no
tribute
to
the
usurping
heathen
emperor
or
allegiance
to
the
throne
of
the
carpenter
s
son
whitened
slowly
under
the
fiery
eyes
which
scorched
him
with
their
brutal
passions
then
came
his
slowly
deliberately
why
tempt
ye
me
give
me
a
penny
that
i
may
see
the
perfumed
exquisite
from
herod
s
court
languidly
fingered
the
gold
pieces
in
his
pouch
with
a
pitying
smile
for
this
penniless
pretender
to
a
throne
and
presently
drawing
therefrom
one
of
the
lesser
coins
of
the
empire
gave
it
to
the
nazarene
whose
is
this
image
and
superscription
demanded
jesus
his
voice
ringing
out
in
the
crowded
place
like
the
peal
of
a
great
bell
cæsar
s
replied
the
courtier
bowing
servilely
at
mention
of
that
name
of
power
then
came
the
wondrous
answer
forever
solving
all
questions
of
human
fealty
render
unto
cæsar
the
things
that
are
cæsar
s
and
unto
god
the
things
that
are
god
instantly
there
arose
from
the
multitude
a
great
hum
of
approval
well
spoken
thou
hast
said
behold
a
solomon
in
our
midst
burst
from
one
and
another
in
chorus
and
the
pharisees
wrathful
and
menacing
withdrew
with
the
crestfallen
herodians
said
i
not
that
he
was
a
match
for
the
best
of
them
cried
peter
showing
his
white
teeth
in
a
great
laugh
of
relief
and
triumph
aye
our
master
is
king
of
a
surety
wiser
than
any
scribe
is
he
keener
than
a
damascus
blade
having
two
but
judas
groaned
aloud
what
a
moment
to
have
declared
himself
he
muttered
and
lost
forever
my
god
what
and
who
is
the
man
tor
had
wriggled
his
small
body
through
the
dense
crowd
back
to
the
feet
of
jesus
where
he
crouched
ready
to
spring
like
a
faithful
dog
at
the
throat
of
any
man
who
should
threaten
his
master
i
have
no
sword
muttered
the
child
to
himself
but
i
have
two
hands
well
furnished
with
nails
also
i
have
teeth
like
the
teeth
of
baladan
let
the
men
in
long
robes
but
as
yet
no
man
durst
lay
so
much
as
a
finger
on
that
seamless
robe
other
tempters
wearing
great
turbans
bearded
scowling
came
to
ask
mocking
questions
concerning
the
resurrection
and
on
the
insensate
ears
of
the
multitude
fell
those
significant
words
which
the
world
has
neither
comprehended
nor
believed
to
this
day
but
as
touching
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
have
ye
not
read
that
which
was
spoken
unto
you
by
god
saying
i
am
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
is
not
the
god
of
the
dead
but
of
the
afterward
the
pharisees
rejoicing
in
the
discomfiture
of
their
hated
rivals
the
sadducees
gathered
again
like
barking
wolves
about
a
hunted
quarry
master
asked
one
of
them
hypocritically
which
is
the
great
commandment
in
the
law
for
they
argued
if
we
can
but
draw
this
witless
carpenter
s
son
into
a
discussion
on
the
law
we
shall
be
able
to
put
him
to
open
shame
before
the
multitude
jesus
answered
the
scribe
without
hesitation
the
first
commandment
is
hear
o
israel
the
lord
our
god
the
lord
is
one
and
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
and
with
all
thy
mind
and
with
all
thy
strength
the
second
is
this
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
there
is
none
other
commandment
greater
than
he
who
had
asked
the
question
trembled
under
the
searching
eyes
of
the
nazarene
of
a
sudden
those
familiar
words
of
the
temple
ritual
blazed
within
his
darkened
soul
like
a
great
light
and
he
answered
truth
with
truth
master
thou
hast
well
said
that
he
is
one
and
there
is
none
other
but
he
and
to
love
him
with
all
the
understanding
and
with
all
the
strength
and
to
love
his
neighbor
as
himself
is
much
more
than
all
whole
burnt
offerings
and
and
jesus
said
to
this
man
thou
art
not
far
from
the
kingdom
of
but
upon
the
others
who
were
openly
sneering
at
their
spokesman
and
muttering
anathemas
in
their
great
beards
he
presently
launched
the
most
terrible
words
ever
spoken
to
man
ghastly
woes
upon
woes
reverberated
in
their
astonished
ears
while
all
the
rottenness
of
their
guilty
hearts
was
suddenly
torn
open
and
laid
bare
for
the
rabble
to
gaze
upon
serpents
offspring
of
vipers
he
called
them
and
hissing
crawling
stinging
they
crept
away
to
their
dens
in
murderous
haste
while
the
fickle
multitude
roused
to
a
very
frenzy
of
excitement
rocked
and
wept
under
the
prophetic
wail
of
his
closing
words
heavy
with
doom
o
jerusalem
jerusalem
which
killeth
the
prophets
and
stoneth
them
that
are
sent
unto
her
how
often
would
i
have
gathered
thy
children
together
even
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
under
her
wings
and
ye
would
not
behold
your
house
is
left
unto
you
desolate
for
i
say
unto
you
ye
shall
not
see
me
henceforth
till
ye
shall
say
blessed
is
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
and
judas
who
had
heard
and
seen
all
staggered
away
blind
and
crazed
with
anger
and
despair
he
muttered
i
see
naught
but
black
ruin
in
his
rash
folly
the
man
hath
cut
the
last
rope
of
safety
there
is
but
one
he
must
again
quell
the
storm
he
has
raised
about
our
ears
with
the
word
of
his
power
and
i
will
force
him
to
it
i
swear
it
in
that
same
hour
the
beggar
tor
saw
and
heard
what
he
has
never
forgotten
to
this
moment
of
his
yet
will
forget
certain
greeks
had
come
up
to
keep
the
passover
at
jerusalem
for
they
had
abandoned
the
pagan
rites
of
rome
and
athens
and
were
trying
to
serve
the
invisible
jehovah
these
heard
speedily
of
the
new
prophet
who
gathered
the
whole
city
to
hear
him
in
the
temple
and
they
desired
mightily
to
see
him
when
one
will
see
jesus
even
to
this
hour
his
desire
is
granted
to
him
so
then
these
gentiles
presently
set
their
longing
eyes
upon
the
man
they
sought
and
jesus
looking
with
prophetic
gaze
adown
the
vista
of
coming
centuries
saw
in
these
foreigners
with
their
clear
fair
faces
and
candid
eyes
those
who
should
truly
accept
him
as
their
king
understanding
as
the
jews
could
not
the
glories
of
his
invisible
kingdom
and
seeing
thus
all
that
must
be
he
said
to
those
about
him
the
hour
is
come
that
the
son
of
man
should
be
and
again
he
said
except
a
grain
of
wheat
fall
into
the
earth
and
die
it
abideth
by
itself
alone
but
if
it
die
it
beareth
much
fruit
he
that
loveth
his
life
loseth
it
and
he
that
hateth
his
life
in
this
world
shall
keep
it
unto
life
eternal
if
any
man
serve
me
let
him
follow
me
and
where
i
am
there
shall
also
my
servant
be
if
any
man
serve
me
him
will
the
father
honor
now
is
my
soul
troubled
and
what
shall
i
say
father
save
me
from
this
hour
but
for
this
cause
came
i
unto
this
hour
father
glorify
thy
then
came
a
great
voice
out
of
the
unseen
i
have
both
glorified
it
and
will
glorify
it
the
people
heard
the
sound
of
the
voice
and
trembled
but
not
to
every
man
is
it
given
to
hear
aright
so
some
said
it
thundered
and
rolled
foolish
eyes
toward
the
cloudless
heavens
others
whispered
an
angel
hath
spoken
to
to
these
jesus
spake
presently
this
voice
hath
not
come
for
my
sake
but
for
your
sakes
now
is
the
judgment
of
this
world
now
shall
the
prince
of
this
world
be
cast
out
and
i
if
i
be
lifted
up
from
the
earth
will
draw
all
men
unto
then
one
of
the
scribes
shaken
out
of
his
hypocrisy
by
the
thunder
of
that
celestial
voice
asked
in
all
sincerity
we
have
heard
out
of
the
law
that
the
christ
abideth
for
ever
and
how
sayest
thou
the
son
of
man
must
be
lifted
up
who
is
this
son
of
man
and
jesus
divinely
patient
answered
once
again
yet
a
little
while
is
the
light
among
you
walk
while
ye
have
the
light
that
darkness
overtake
you
not
and
he
that
walketh
in
the
darkness
knoweth
not
whither
he
goeth
while
ye
have
the
light
believe
on
the
light
that
ye
may
become
sons
of
and
with
that
word
he
went
away
and
hid
himself
and
no
man
saw
him
for
many
hours
chapter
vii
felicia
stronger
even
than
the
cords
of
love
are
the
cords
of
habit
if
a
man
has
shaken
a
brazen
cup
and
bellowed
for
alms
for
more
than
a
score
of
years
the
cup
and
the
cry
will
have
become
a
part
of
himself
not
lightly
to
be
shaken
off
chelluh
with
eyes
hungered
as
before
and
as
before
he
coveted
money
for
his
few
and
evil
pleasures
so
it
came
to
pass
that
after
a
day
spent
in
he
was
again
squatting
comfortably
in
his
familiar
corner
by
the
damascus
gate
his
eyes
closed
his
horny
knuckles
beating
a
monotonous
accompaniment
to
the
familiar
mendicant
s
whine
have
mercy
kind
lords
of
jerusalem
have
mercy
on
the
sorrows
of
one
born

kind
lords
beautiful
ladies

denarius
i
beseech
of
you
tor
searching
anxiously
for
his
new
master
in
every
corner
of
the
city
came
upon
the
beggar
unawares
and
stopped
short
in
indignant
amaze
did
not
the
king
my
master
give
thee
sight
but
yesterday
he
demanded
chelluh
opened
his
eyes
with
a
muttered
malediction
who
art
thou
he
snarled
to
question
me
how
else
shall
i
live
tor
looked
hard
at
the
man
s
great
bulk
there
are
many
laborers
working
in
the
great
quarries
yonder
he
answered
slowly
the
romans
pay
every
man
of
them
a
silver
chelluh
replied
to
this
suggestion
with
a
string
of
curses
spoken
in
three
languages
he
ended
by
hurling
a
great
stone
at
the
lad
s
head
badly
aimed
the
missile
crashed
over
the
wall
of
a
garden
hard
by
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
during
which
chelluh
scuttled
rapidly
away
then
a
small
door
in
the
wall
was
suddenly
thrown
open
and
two
men
darted
out
they
looked
up
and
down
the
narrow
street
and
seeing
no
one
but
tor
who
stood
staring
in
stupefied
silence
after
the
beggar
they
seized
the
boy
and
dragged
him
into
the
enclosure
locking
and
barring
the
door
behind
them
tis
an
evil
offspring
of
beggars
that
hath
done
this
mischief
exclaimed
one
of
the
men
angrily
did
i
not
say
it
the
other
man
fixed
his
eyes
on
tor
didst
thou
throw
the
stone
that
broke
the
great
vase
yonder
he
asked
tor
s
wild
bright
eyes
followed
the
man
s
accusing
finger
to
the
spot
where
an
urn
carven
from
costly
marble
lay
in
ruins
amid
a
tangle
of
bright
flowers
i
did
not
throw
the
stone
he
said
lies
cried
the
first
man
stamping
his
foot
why
question
a
dog
give
the
fellow
to
me
i
will
scourge
him
soundly
and
thrust
him
forth
his
bleeding
back
will
perchance
warn
others
of
his
sort
to
keep
their
distance
from
the
i
am
not
a
dog
said
tor
boldly
i
am
the
servant
of
a
king
i
was
looking
for
my
master
and
another
hurled
the
stone
at
me
but
because
the
man
was
lately
healed
of
blindness
he
could
not
throw
a
stone
with
ease
and
therefore
it
came
over
the
one
of
the
men
shook
with
laughter
at
this
speech
nay
but
thou
art
a
pretty
liar
he
said
at
last
the
servant
of
a
king
aye
thou
dost
look
the
part
rarely
may
i
ask
thee
the
name
of
thy
royal
master
his
name
is
jesus
said
tor
i
was
blind
and
he
gave
me
eyes
therefore
i
serve
the
faces
of
both
men
had
grown
suddenly
serious
they
exchanged
significant
glances
better
hold
the
boy
till
my
lord
s
return
he
will
perchance
wish
to
question
him
of
the
matter
said
one
and
the
other
nodding
gripped
the
child
roughly
by
the
shoulder
and
presently
thrust
him
into
an
empty
scullery
of
an
inner
court
tor
flung
himself
against
the
heavy
door
in
a
sudden
fury
of
despair
let
me
out
he
screamed
let
me
out
i
must
find
my
then
as
no
one
paid
the
slightest
heed
to
his
outcries
he
began
to
look
about
him
for
some
means
of
escape
the
one
window
high
in
the
wall
was
heavily
barred
and
there
was
no
opening
in
the
small
dark
chamber
save
the
door
by
which
he
had
entered
and
this
was
fast
locked
on
the
outside
the
boy
tore
at
his
rags
like
a
trapped
animal
then
spying
a
great
sealed
jar
in
one
corner
he
began
to
scratch
savagely
at
its
cover
if
it
be
wine
he
muttered
i
will
drink
my
fill
for
once
nay
i
will
do
more
i
will
spill
upon
the
earth
all
that
i
can
not
drink
i
hate
the
men
who
have
thrust
me
into
this
place
also
i
hate
chelluh
some
day
i
will
kill
forgive
if
ye
have
aught
against
any
one
that
your
father
may
forgive
who
had
spoken
the
beggar
child
ceased
his
clawing
at
the
sealed
lid
of
the
jar
his
flushed
face
paled
slowly
the
words
rang
clearly
in
his
bewildered
ears
he
sank
slowly
to
the
floor
and
dropped
his
head
to
his
lean
knees
in
an
effort
to
remember
it
was
my
master
who
said
it
he
muttered
at
last
he
said
forgive
that
your
father
may
father
the
child
s
face
lighted
with
sudden
joy
he
said
whosoever
asks
shall
have
i
will
ask
for
i
want
to
get
out
of
this
place
that
i
may
follow
my
then
in
a
loud
clear
voice
after
the
fashion
of
the
pharisees
he
had
heard
praying
in
the
temple
and
on
the
corners
of
the
streets
he
cried
aloud
father
i
want
to
get
out
of
this
place
my
father
i
want
to
get
father
there
was
a
soft
fumbling
sound
at
the
door
who
is
calling
asked
a
sweet
imperious
voice
i
am
calling
answered
tor
expectantly
i
want
to
get
i
can
t
unlock
the
door
answered
the
voice
but
oonah
can
be
quiet
till
i
fetch
a
moment
later
the
sunshine
streamed
in
through
the
open
door
revealing
the
figure
of
a
very
beautiful
child
on
its
threshold
behind
the
child
stood
a
young
girl
attired
like
a
servant
she
was
smiling
broadly
how
didst
thou
come
in
here
boy
she
asked
staring
curiously
at
the
beggar
s
face
and
scant
rags
the
fat
man
with
the
red
tunic
put
me
here
said
tor
he
said

broke
the
vase
with
a
stone
but

did
it

marcus
who

him
up
said
the
maid
pursing
up
her
lips
knowingly
i
must
shut
him
in
again
and
make
fast
the
door
before
marcus
finds
out
that
i
have
opened
it
come
princess

silent
oonah
i
wish
to
speak
to

boy
said
the
child
with
a
gesture
of
command
where
is
thy
father
she
continued
fixing
her
blue
eyes
on
tor
i
heard
thee
calling
him
i
thought
it
was
set
the
slave
boy
he
is
always
getting
into
tor
pointed
upward
vaguely
i
called
my
father
who
is
in
heaven
he
said
i
have
not
seen
him
but
he
causes
what
one
asks
to
be
done
my
master
said
who
said
it
my
master
his
name
is
jesus
he
is
a
king
he
made
me
see
i
was
thou
wast
blind
cried
the
laughing
incredulously
nay
but
thine
eyes
are
bright
as
they
were
not
bright
said
tor
soberly
they
were
smitten
into
darkness
the
roman
did
it
with
his
but
the
king
my
master
touched
them
so
i
see
i
must
find
him
i
pray
thee
let
me
go

him
go
said
the
child
imperiously
dost

and
stay
i
will
give
the
boy
my
gold
bracelet
that
father
gave
me
yesterday
nay
i
have
said
it
the
maid
clasped
her
hands
but
princess
she
entreated
what
would
the
honorable
lady
thy
mother
do
with
me
if
the
bracelet
be
missing
and
to
a
beggar
thou
seest
that
he
is
nothing
more
the
boy
would
be
scourged
or
stoned
if
found
with
such
a
jewel
in
his
the
child
glanced
doubtfully
at
tor
from
under
the
curling
gold
of
her
hair
what
shall
i
give
thee
boy
she
asked
for
i
will
give
thee
something

hast
amused
me
and

quite
weary
of

tor
promptly
also
i
am
thirsty

i
want
to
get
out
of
this
the
little
princess
burst
into
a
silvery
laugh
come
with
me
she
said
imperiously
and
before
the
maid
could
stop
her
she
seized
the
beggar
child
by
the
hand
and
drew
him
away
up
the
steps
of
a
marble
terrace
oonah
followed
in
terrified
silence
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
silken
canopy
on
a
couch
of
ivory
and
silver
cushioned
with
damask
reclined
a
lady
the
most
beautiful
lady
thought
tor
that
the
sun
ever
shone
upon
the
beggar
s
brilliant
eyes
sparkled
with
amazement
and
pleasure
his
white
teeth
glimmered
through
his
scarlet
lips
in
an
innocent
smile
which
faded
before
the
look
of
haughty
displeasure
on
the
lady
s
fair
face
what
is
this
felicia
she
demanded
raising
her
head
from
the
pillow
to
a
white
hand
loaded
with
gems
oh
my
worshipful
lady
began
oonah
trembling
under
the
cold
questioning
eyes
which
were
bent
upon
her
i
beseech
of
thee
to
listen
to
me
while
be
silent
oonah
said
felicia
stamping
her
small
foot
i
will
explain
i
was
trying
to
amuse
myself
in
the
gardens
as
usual
with
this
foolish
oonah
she
went
on
rapidly
and
i
heard
some
one
call
it
was
this
boy
that
ugly
meddlesome
marcus
had
shut
him
into
the
cellar
without
food
or
drink
he
has
done
nothing
at
all
and
more
than
that
he
is
the
servant
of
a
king
i
wished
to
give
him
my
bracelet
and
let
him
go
but
oonah
disputed
the
matter
with
me
as
i
have
forbidden
her
to
do
may
i
not
do
as
i
will
with
my
own
stay
my
child
i
will
call
marcus
said
the
lady
smiling
he
will
nay
he
shall
not
interfere
cried
the
spoiled
child
the
boy
hath
amused
me
and
marcus
shall
not
have
him
heigho
this
jerusalem
is
so
dull
i
am
weary
of
the
child
threw
back
her
head
with
an
exaggerated
gesture
of
lassitude
which
brought
another
smile
to
the
lady
s
lips
how
hath
the
boy
amused
thee
little
one
she
asked
languidly
if
there
is
anything
diverting
about
this
place
i
would
fain
hear
of
the
boy
was
blind
mother
and
the
king
his
master
touched
his
eyes
and
they
became
bright
as
thou
seest
them
is
not
that
an
amusing
story
what
king
in
jerusalem
can
heal
blind
eyes
asked
the
lady
turning
with
some
curiosity
to
tor
his
name
is
jesus
said
tor
simply
the
lady
drew
her
delicate
brows
together
i
have
heard
of
the
man
she
said
coldly
he
is
arousing
sedition
among
the
turbulent
jews
as
hath
many
a
one
before
him
he
will
shortly
be
dealt
with
after
his
kind
i
doubt
he
will
not
be
hurt
said
tor
positively
my
father
will
not
permit
anything
to
befall
thy
father
repeated
the
lady
and
who
pray
is
thy
father
he
is
in
heaven
explained
tor
he
listens
to
me
and
to
any
one
who
calls
it
was
because
i
prayed
to
him
as
my
master
said
that
the
door
was
opened
and
now
let
me
go
i
must
find
my
stay
said
the
lady
frowning
i
will
be
further
amused
wast
thou
always
the
king
thy
master
touched
thee
no
said
tor
i
had
my
eyes
as
now
then
one
day
i
pursued
the
roman
pilate
as
he
rode
in
his
chariot
and
asked
for
denarii
he
struck
me
with
his
whip
and
the
lash
blinded
me
i
cursed
the
man
many
times
in
my
blindness
with
strong
curses
that
blight
like
a
flame
but
now
i
have
forgiven
him
because
my
master
commands
me
to
forgive
if
i
have
aught
against
any
one
for
this
saying
i
have
forgiven
the
cruel
gentile
who
is
hated
of
all
jerusalem
also
i
have
illustration
take
him
away
she
tor
was
interrupted
by
a
smothered
exclamation
from
the
lady
her
blue
eyes
were
blazing
with
sudden
anger
take
him
away
she
commanded
thrust
him
into
the
once
dost
thou
hear
oonah
the
child
felicia
stood
as
if
rooted
to
the
ground
in
amazement
her
large
eyes
brimming
over
with
tears
while
oonah
roused
to
action
by
the
wrath
in
her
mistress
s
face
seized
tor
by
the
shoulder
and
hurried
him
through
the
garden
pausing
only
to
unlock
a
small
door
in
the
wall
run
now
beggar
for
thy
wretched
life
whispered
the
girl
as
she
pushed
the
boy
into
the
street
this
is
the
house
of
pilate
and
yonder
was
his
wife
and

chelluh

a
bargain
the
dog
baladan
led
a
lonely
life
in
these
days
confined
to
his
own
little
quarter
of
jerusalem
by
that
unwritten
yet
inexorable
law
which
prevails
to
this
day
among
the
half
wild
street
dogs
of
oriental
cities
he
dared
not
follow
his
adopted
master
beyond
the
corner
of
the
short
dark
street
which
was
his
chosen
haunt
after
some
mysterious
fashion
the
dog
was
aware
that
should
he
venture
alone
into
the
streets
and
squares
beyond
he
would
be
instantly
torn
in
pieces
tis
seldom
that
an
animal
of
the
pariah
breed
shows
the
least
regard
or
affection
for
men
but
tor
was
so
like
a
little
animal
himself
that
the
heart
of
the
great
gaunt
beast
had
gone
out
to
him
and
tor
responded
in
kind
the
undivided
love
of
a
beast
is
better
than
no
love
at
all
perhaps
it
is
because
of
this
that
the
heart
of
a
dog
is
so
loving
more
than
once
has
it
solaced
pain
that
would
otherwise
be
unbearable
in
the
nobler
heart
of
a
child
baladan
was
licking
with
anxious
care
a
fragment
of
leather
once
worn
by
his
little
master
this
done
he
laid
his
ugly
head
upon
it
and
dreamed
a
vague
dream
of
delight
in
which
one
figure
of
always
before
him
suddenly
he
sprang
up
his
rough
coat
bristling
and
listened
then
with
a
whine
of
delight
bounded
forward
and
flung
himself
upon
the
small
naked
figure
that
was
stealing
along
in
the
shadow
of
the
high
walls
tor
was
breathing
fast
and
his
puny
chest
heaved
with
an
occasional
strangling
sob
as
he
flung
himself
down
by
the
dog
oh
baladan
he
whispered
i
can
t
find
him
what
shall
i
do
baladan
covered
the
child
s
feet
with
warm
wet
kisses
his
great
brown
eyes
brimming
over
with
tears
of
anxious
affection
he
moaned
and
gurgled
and
laid
one
hard
paw
on
his
master
s
knee
in
token
of
his
utter
allegiance
tor
wound
his
thin
arms
about
the
dog
s
neck
and
buried
his
face
in
the
scanty
yellow
fur
let
us
sleep
baladan
he
said
drowsily
after
a
time
and
the
two
curled
themselves
in
their
old
haunt
under
the
dark
archway
and
presently
dreamed
and
slept
the
sound
of
voices
lowered
to
a
hissing
whisper
suddenly
aroused
the
child
he
touched
the
dog
warningly
and
listened
a
name
had
been
name
of
his
was
sure
of
it
i
have
a
score
to
settle
with
the
galilean
i
tell
thee
said
the
whining
voice
of
chelluh
the
other
man
is
nothing
to
did
he
not
heal
thee
of
blindness
demanded
the
second
voice
with
a
touch
of
impatience
he
did
and
that
i
will
swear
to
since
then
the
matter
has
been
noised
abroad
and
no
one
will
give
me
so
much
as
a
denarius
to
buy
my
daily
victual
they
tell
me
to
cut
build
walls
may
the
furies
reward
them
i
will
not
work
and
i
will
thou
shalt
eat
thy
fill
if
thou
wilt
do
my
bidding
listen
this
man
jesus
who
has
so
taken
thy
living
from
thee
is
either
a
god
or
a
false
jehovah
help
me
but
i
know
not
what
he
is
the
priests
and
pharisees
hate
him
the
people
are
divided
he
must
declare
himself
either
one
way
or
the
other
i
have
sworn
that
i
will
force
him
to
it
and
i
have
sworn
further
to
deliver
him
into
the
hands
of
the
priests
without
tumult
i
have
watched
thee
and
thou
art
a
tool
fitted
to
my
hand
go
thou
among
those
of
thine
own
sort
and
arouse
them
against
the
man
thou
canst
do
it
thou
hast
a
nimble
tongue
and
the
rabble
will
hear
what
if
he
be
a
god
demanded
chelluh
with
a
gesture
of
fear
nay
i
will
have
none
of
it
he
opened
mine
eyes
and
i
was
born
blind
i
am
afraid
to
lift
my
hand
against
such
a
but
if
he
be
a
god
said
the
other
eagerly
he
will
make
it
known
rather
than
die
like
a
criminal
hark
you
they
will
stone
him
or
crucify
him
if
they
are
i
am
afraid
of
the
man
growled
chelluh
and
who
art
thou
to
do
this
thing
i
am
no
whining
levite
but
verily
a
i
am
a
patriot
declared
the
other
boldly
i
know
the
man
well
he
professes
to
be
messiah
if
he
is
the
true
deliverer
not
a
hair
of
his
head
shall
be
hurt
if
not
let
him
die
the
death
i
have
sworn
then
was
a
short
silence
broken
by
the
musical
chink
of
silver
there
is
naught
to
fear
from
jesus
of
nazareth
said
the
voice
of
the
man
who
had
declared
himself
a
patriot
he
would
render
to
no
man
evil
for
evil
i
have
heard
him
say
it
many
times
and
i
know
that
he
is
true
he
loves
his
enemies
and
forgives
every
one
who
once
only
but
seventy
times
seven
if
he
prove
to
be
messiah
i
shall
confess
my
plans
and
my
thoughts
to
him
and
he
will
forgive
me
readily
i
shall
then
be
a
great
prince
and
potentate
in
the
new
kingdom
this
paltry
sum
shall
be
multiplied
to
thee
thrice
i
will
do
it
said
chelluh
shaking
the
silver
pieces
in
his
hard
palms
till
they
chinked
again
and
i
also
will
be
forgiven
after
i
have
worked
my
will
with
the
man
and
with
the
the
beggar
laughed
aloud
tor
shuddered
at
the
evil
sound
as
he
lay
quiet
in
his
lair
after
that
the
silence
remained
unbroken
and
the
child
at
length
ventured
to
peep
out
from
the
archway
the
two
men
were
just
emerging
into
the
lighted
square
beyond
and
the
sun
falling
full
upon
the
face
of
chelluh
s
companion
revealed
it
as
the
face
of
judas
tor
flung
his
arms
about
the
neck
of
the
dog
oh
baladan
he
whispered
i
must
find
my
master
if
i
were
only
a
great
man
with
a
great
sword
how
i
would
fight
for
him
but
the
boy
remained
where
he
was
for
another
hour
till
the
sun
had
sunken
behind
the
mountains
then
emerging
into
the
twilight
of
the
narrow
street
he
trotted
noiselessly
away
baladan
followed
at
his
heels
like
a
shadow
and
like
a
shadow
refused
to
be
left
behind
at
the
accustomed
boundary
some
vague
stirring
in
the
dog
s
loving
heart
told
him
that
his
master
was
going
into
danger
and
forthwith
his
own
imminent
peril
was
forgotten
to
his
unbounded
joy
tor
saw
not
many
rods
distant
the
figure
of
peter
the
galilean
walking
swiftly
along
with
bent
head
he
ran
to
him
and
placing
himself
directly
in
the
man
s
way
bowed
himself
humbly
before
him
i
beseech
thee
to
listen
to
me
honorable
galilean
he
began
for
i
have
evil
tidings
which
concern
my
the
dog
whined
uneasily
and
flattened
his
lean
body
against
the
stones
the
man
s
angry
eyes
cut
him
like
a
lash
out
of
my
way
companion
of
a
pariah
said
the
galilean
with
profound
disgust
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
the
master
he
strode
forward
shaking
off
with
a
shudder
of
loathing
the
small
imploring
hand
of
the
beggar
child
they
will
kill
him
cried
tor
the
man
said
so
they
hate
him
the
dog
sprang
forward
with
a
low
growl
of
anger
and
fastened
his
white
teeth
in
the
garments
of
the
fisherman
that
wail
of
anguish
in
his
master
s
voice
had
roused
him
to
a
frenzy
the
galilean
raised
his
stout
oaken
staff
and
smote
the
animal
with
all
his
strength
the
gaunt
body
quivered
dropped
rolled
over
once
and
was
still
the
jew
hurried
away
breathing
deep
in
his
anger
and
disgust
i
am
defiled
he
muttered
for
the
breath
of
an
unclean
beast
hath
polluted
my
he
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
and
beheld
the
beggar
kneeling
by
the
body
of
the
dog
and
his
indignation
found
vent
in
mouthed
muttered
curses
that
same
night
the
passover
was
sacrificed
and
all
jerusalem
feasted
with
solemn
rites
and
decorous
rejoicings
but
tor
crouched
on
the
stones
outside
one
of
the
low
dark
houses
within
the
third
wall
of
the
city
he
had
followed
the
galilean
afar
off
had
seen
him
at
length
with
his
master
and
the
eleven
enter
this
house
the
child
drowsed
between
whiles
as
the
hours
passed
and
the
white
moon
looked
down
at
him
between
the
houses
he
had
forgiven
peter
the
galilean
for
the
death
of
baladan
even
as
his
master
had
commanded
and
that
singular
peace
which
the
world
neither
gives
nor
takes
away
filled
his
soul
he
could
have
told
no
man
why
he
was
so
strangely
content
when
in
the
old
days
fury
would
have
scorched
him
for
the
moment
he
had
forgotten
the
evil
words
of
chelluh
and
the
disciple
called
judas
and
remembering
them
he
murmured
a
simple
prayer
to
the
mysterious
unseen
father
in
whom
he
was
coming
to
believe
with
all
the
strength
of
his
childish
being
our
father
will
take
care
of
my
master
he
said
aloud
and
smiled
alone
in
the
darkness
within
the
house
in
a
large
upper
chamber
jesus
sat
at
his
last
meal
upon
earth
with
the
few
whom
he
had
chosen
knowing
all
things
that
should
shortly
come
to
pass
and
understanding
to
the
full
the
pitiful
ignorance
and
darkness
in
the
hearts
of
the
disciples
again
they
disputed
among
themselves
as
to
which
of
them
should
be
accounted
greatest
in
that
coming
kingdom
of
glory
which
the
master
now
told
them
plainly
had
been
appointed
unto
him
to
sit
upon
twelve
thrones
judging
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
was
indeed
a
glorious
future
they
accepted
the
idea
with
complaisance
but
one
must
be
greater
than
his
fellows
in
any
kingdom
and
each
of
them
coveted
the
supreme
crown
of
power
then
jesus
knowing
that
the
father
had
given
all
things
into
his
hands
and
that
he
came
forth
from
god
and
was
going
to
god
arose
from
supper
and
laying
aside
his
garments
took
a
basin
and
began
to
wash
the
disciples
feet
and
to
wipe
them
with
the
towel
wherewith
he
was
girded
and
so
he
came
in
turn
to
peter
peter
said
to
him
lord
thou
shalt
never
wash
my
jesus
answered
if
i
wash
thee
not
thou
hast
no
part
with
lord
not
my
feet
only
said
peter
but
my
hands
and
my
then
came
that
dark
moment
when
the
man
called
judas
received
the
morsel
of
bread
dipped
in
wine
what
thou
doest
do
quickly
said
the
master
with
a
look
of
full
understanding
which
penetrated
the
dismal
labyrinth
of
the
man
s
soul
like
a
flash
of
blinding
light
judas
ran
violently
out
of
the
house
and
the
darkness
swallowed
him
he
knew
himself
at
last
he
was
no
eager
patriot
no
doubting
disciple
anxious
to
force
a
triumphant
issue
he
ground
his
teeth
in
a
very
fury
of
rage
and
hatred
as
he
sped
on
his
terrible
mission
the
beggar
child
drowsing
on
the
cold
stones
without
shuddered
at
sound
of
that
ominous
hurrying
footfall
my
father
will
take
care
of
him
he
murmured
and
again
slept
within
that
upper
chamber
the
compassionate
master
was
trying
to
prepare
the
little
company
of
unsuspecting
disciples
for
the
darker
hours
just
before
them
all
ye
shall
be
offended
because
of
me
this
night
he
said
sorrowfully
for
it
is
written
i
will
smite
the
shepherd
and
the
sheep
of
the
flock
shall
be
scattered
abroad
but
after
i
am
raised
up
i
will
go
before
you
into
peter
answered
in
his
bold
positive
way
although
all
shall
be
offended
yet
will
not
jesus
said
to
him
verily
i
say
unto
thee
that
this
night
before
the
cock
crow
twice
thou
shalt
deny
me
but
the
galilean
answered
with
exceeding
vehemence
if
i
must
die
with
thee
i
will
not
deny
thee
and
so
likewise
said
all
the
others
chapter
ix
before
the
cock
crew
the
primal
instinct
which
has
ever
led
man
to
the
kind
bosom
of
earth
in
his
darkest
hour
led
the
man
christ
jesus
to
gethsemane
and
there
under
the
dense
shadow
of
the
ancient
olives
he
threw
himself
down
upon
the
ground
for
that
last
exceeding
bitter
struggle
with
his
humanity
and
peter
the
galilean
and
the
tor
had
followed
them
noiseless
and
unseen
as
a
friendly
shadow
he
did
not
approach
the
king
his
master
nor
did
he
again
venture
to
accost
peter
squatting
motionless
at
the
gate
of
the
garden
the
child
thought
confusedly
but
joyfully
of
his
deliverance
from
the
house
of
pilate
it
was
because
i
prayed
to
my
father
he
told
himself
and
hugged
his
lean
little
body
with
a
low
laugh
of
pleasure
hereafter
i
need
fear
nothing
i
will
call
and
he
will
deliver
me
and
neither
man
nor
demon
can
his
soul
went
out
in
a
flood
of
love
toward
the
man
who
had
opened
his
eyes
and
who
was
at
that
moment
lying
upon
his
face
under
the
olives
in
a
wordless
agony
and
the
child
s
pure
thoughts
mingled
with
the
cloudy
forms
of
angels
which
comforted
him
somewhere
afar
off
lights
gleamed
among
the
dark
trees
stealthy
footfalls
and
hushed
voices
beyond
the
garden
wall
reached
the
boy
s
keen
ears
he
sprang
up
and
listened
intently
the
glare
of
smoking
torches
and
the
irregular
tread
of
hurrying
feet
sent
vibrations
of
horror
through
the
shuddering
night
but
the
man
of
nazareth
no
longer
lay
upon
his
face
amid
the
shadows
he
came
forth
to
receive
the
brimming
cup
of
his
sorrows
radiant
with
the
power
that
had
never
failed
him
stooping
over
his
sleeping
disciples
he
called
them
arise
let
us
be
going
behold
he
that
betrayeth
me
is
at
now
judas
had
before
agreed
with
the
officers
that
he
would
greet
his
master
with
a
kiss
so
that
ye
may
know
the
man
from
his
disciples
dolts
every
one
and
not
worth
the
as
the
motley
crowd
of
temple
police
bearing
torches
followed
by
a
rabble
of
the
curious
advanced
into
the
gloom
of
the
garden
a
superstitious
awe
fell
upon
them
they
drew
back
to
a
man
and
hesitated
casting
fearful
glances
at
the
dark
masses
of
trees
moving
gently
in
the
night
wind
some
unseen
noiseless
terror
seemed
to
lurk
amid
the
shifting
shadows
if
the
man
be
a
prophet
whispered
one
there
be
blasting
lightnings
at
his
call
let
us
go
but
judas
turned
his
sneering
face
upon
the
speaker
with
a
low
laugh
of
scorn
master
master
he
cried
mockingly
and
running
forward
he
clasped
and
kissed
the
saviour
of
the
world
jesus
said
to
him
judas
betrayest
thou
the
son
of
man
with
a
kiss
lord
shall
we
smite
with
the
sword
cried
one
of
the
disciples
not
waiting
for
an
answer
peter
drew
his
weapon
and
aimed
a
mighty
blow
at
the
officer
nearest
him
the
man
fell
back
with
a
bellow
of
rage
and
pain
while
his
companions
sprang
forward
and
seized
jesus
the
eyes
of
the
prisoner
grave
calm
and
compassionate
were
fixed
upon
the
wounded
man
from
whose
severed
ear
blood
spurted
in
a
torrent
permit
me
thus
far
he
said
gently
to
the
officers
who
grasped
him
by
the
arms
and
reaching
forth
he
touched
the
ear
and
healed
it
then
that
omniscient
gaze
turned
full
upon
peter
who
stood
staring
in
a
frozen
stupor
at
the
being
he
had
believed
to
be
the
invincible
messiah
put
up
again
thy
sword
into
its
place
said
the
master
for
all
they
that
take
the
sword
shall
perish
with
the
then
answering
further
the
thoughts
that
looked
out
of
the
bewildered
eyes
of
the
man
whom
he
had
named
the
rock
he
said
thinkest
thou
that
i
can
not
now
pray
to
my
father
and
he
shall
presently
give
me
more
than
twelve
legions
of
angels
but
how
then
shall
the
scriptures
be
fulfilled
that
thus
it
must
be
but
he
uttered
no
prayer
to
his
father
and
the
ranks
of
the
angelic
host
remained
hid
from
the
expectant
eyes
that
searched
the
empty
heavens
in
that
same
hour
jesus
said
to
the
multitude
which
gathered
about
him
threatening
yet
by
the
miracle
are
ye
come
out
as
against
a
thief
with
swords
and
staves
when
i
was
daily
with
you
in
the
temple
ye
stretched
forth
no
hands
against
me
but
this
is
your
hour
and
the
power
of
at
that
word
the
darkness
closed
in
about
it
was
night
in
the
courtyard
of
the
high
priest
s
house
tor
lurked
in
the
shelter
of
a
doorway
and
looked
on
no
one
had
noticed
the
child
as
he
slipped
in
with
the
crowd
that
held
at
its
core
the
silent
man
of
nazareth
peter
had
also
followed
tor
watched
the
galilean
seat
himself
with
the
others
at
a
small
fire
which
was
kindled
in
the
midst
of
the
place
he
had
turned
his
back
upon
the
travesty
of
a
legal
examination
which
was
going
on
at
the
upper
end
of
the
hall
and
was
warming
his
fingers
with
an
air
of
complete
indifference
so
the
dangerous
prophet
is
proven
but
a
man
of
straw
after
all
quoth
one
of
the
lesser
officers
of
the
police
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
toward
the
meek
figure
of
the
nazarene
look
you
upon
the
fellow
now
he
hath
never
a
word
to
say
for
himself
and
there
are
no
thunders
by
the
candlestick
i
declare
to
you
that
i
was
in
a
cold
sweat
when
i
laid
hands
on
the
man
but
i
felt
nothing
more
terrible
than
an
arm
of
flesh
and
blood
under
his
rabbi
s
a
rabbi
s
robe
indeed
chuckled
another
he
will
wear
another
sort
before
many
days
i
promise
but
what
sayest
thou
to
the
healing
of
s
ear
demanded
a
woman
who
had
approached
the
fire
i
have
just
talked
with
the
son
of
joseph
he
declares
that
from
henceforth
he
is
a
a
great
shout
of
laughter
greeted
this
speech
hath
ever
a
nimble
tongue
quoth
a
young
fellow
who
carried
a
short
sword
stuck
in
his
belt
a
nimble
tongue
say
i
and
the
long
ears
of
an
ass
one
of
the
galileans
made
a
lunge
at
him
but
being
a
clumsy
knave
of
a
fisherman
and
knowing
naught
of
the
uses
of
a
sword
he
merely
grazed
the
nay
fellow
the
ear
was
sliced
clean
off
growled
peter
stung
to
retort
by
the
sneering
words
of
the
judean
the
woman
bent
forward
to
stare
at
the
speaker
art
not
thou
also
one
of
the
man
s
disciples
she
asked
curiously
i
am
not
said
peter
shortly
he
was
listening
painfully
to
his
master
s
voice
in
response
to
a
question
of
the
high
priest
at
sound
of
a
violent
blow
he
twisted
quite
about
in
his
place
and
beheld
the
colorless
face
of
jesus
slowly
reddening
under
the
insult
if
i
have
spoken
evil
he
was
saying
in
a
low
clear
voice
bear
witness
of
the
evil
but
if
well
why
smitest
thou
me
the
galilean
rose
from
his
place
at
the
fire
breathing
deep
his
strong
hands
clenched
at
his
sides
in
futile
anger
why
doth
he
not
blast
them
with
the
word
of
his
power
he
asked
himself
as
he
stealthily
watched
the
terrible
mockery
of
justice
which
was
now
drawing
to
its
close
they
were
questioning
the
prisoner
sharply
now
peter
could
see
the
dark
looks
of
satisfaction
on
the
faces
of
the
priests
and
sanhedrists
and
the
sneering
laughter
of
the
rabble
at
their
back
then
came
a
show
of
witnesses
against
the
prisoner
among
the
witnesses
stood
chelluh
the
beggar
who
had
once
been
blind
the
man
healed
me
of
it
is
so
most
worshipful
lords
he
whined
twas
accomplished
by
black
magic
and
the
power
of
beelzebub
i
declare
to
you
for
he
who
would
lightly
destroy
the
temple
of
god
must
needs
be
of
the
what
sayest
thou
of
the
temple
fellow
demanded
the
high
priest
did
the
man
dare
to
threaten
the
temple
most
holy
and
reverend
high
priest
replied
chelluh
the
nazarene
said
in
my
hearing
and
in
the
hearing
of
this
friend
of
honest
craftsman
as
thou
i
am
able
to
destroy
the
temple
of
god
and
to
build
it
in
three
days
the
high
priest
arose
in
his
place
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
prisoner
answerest
thou
nothing
he
hissed
between
set
teeth
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
saying
which
these
reputable
witnesses
bring
against
thee
jesus
seemed
not
to
have
heard
the
question
his
inscrutable
eyes
were
bent
upon
the
ground
upon
his
face
shone
a
faint
mysterious
light
the
high
priest
bent
forward
and
stared
at
him
unrelentingly
adjure
thee
by
the
living
god
that
thou
tell
us
whether
thou
be
the
christ
the
son
of
god
he
cried
in
a
terrible
voice
the
man
of
nazareth
lifted
his
meek
head
at
that
word
i
am
he
said
and
ye
shall
see
the
son
of
man
sitting
at
the
right
hand
of
power
and
coming
with
the
clouds
of
he
hath
spoken
blasphemy
exclaimed
the
high
priest
rending
his
garments
with
a
gesture
of
outraged
holiness
what
further
need
have
we
of
witnesses
ye
have
heard
the
blasphemy
what
think
ye
he
is
guilty
came
the
answer
of
the
priests
cries
of
triumph
dreadful
laughter
the
sound
of
buffeting
palms
burst
forth
from
judges
and
witnesses
alike
some
one
was
tying
a
handkerchief
over
the
face
of
the
prisoner
with
the
mocking
words
behold
the
prophet
prophesy
unto
us
thou
christ
who
is
he
that
smote
thee
yelled
the
savage
voice
of
the
beggar
who
had
received
his
sight
and
he
smote
his
blinded
saviour
with
open
palms
times
a
suffocating
mist
rolled
before
the
eyes
of
peter
if
he
were
the
messiah
he
groaned
this
could
not
be
the
man
hath
mocked
and
deceived
us
from
the
beginning
somewhere
not
far
away
sounded
the
cheerful
crowing
of
a
cock
i
will
go
back
to
galilee
he
muttered
but
his
leaden
feet
carried
him
no
farther
from
the
awful
scene
than
the
porch
here
he
loitered
listening
with
a
frightful
strained
attention
to
the
sounds
of
ribaldry
and
laughter
that
came
out
to
him
through
the
doors
i
will
go
he
said
aloud
i
must
go
it
is
already
the
servants
of
the
high
priest
s
household
were
astir
and
cheerfully
busy
with
their
morning
tasks
one
of
them
a
buxom
maid
bearing
a
jar
upon
her
head
paused
and
stared
attentively
at
the
galilean
aha
she
exclaimed
this
man
also
was
with
jesus
the
peter
raised
his
heavy
eyes
to
the
inquisitive
face
of
the
woman
i
know
not
the
man
he
snarled
with
an
oath
the
woman
went
her
way
with
a
laughing
gesture
of
unbelief
then
others
of
the
bystanders
began
to
cast
curious
glances
at
the
haggard
face
and
wild
eyes
of
the
stranger
they
whispered
among
themselves
for
a
space
then
a
man
wearing
the
livery
of
the
house
of
annas
advanced
with
an
air
of
determination
certainly
thou
art
one
of
them
he
said
authoritatively
for
thou
art
a
peter
turned
upon
the
man
with
a
torrent
of
angry
oaths
i
tell
thee
fellow
he
cried
loudly
that
i
know
not
this
man
of
whom
thou
the
cock
crew
for
the
second
time
the
great
doors
of
the
were
flung
wide
and
the
motley
throng
of
priests
and
underlings
glutted
with
their
awful
triumph
pushed
through
dragging
the
piteous
figure
of
their
prisoner
the
face
of
the
nazarene
gleamed
white
and
calm
amid
the
dark
looks
of
his
persecutors
his
loving
eyes
turned
for
the
last
time
upon
peter
and
flashed
into
his
darkened
soul
the
remembrance
of
that
sad
word
of
prophecy
before
the
cock
crow
twice
thou
shalt
deny
me
and
peter
went
out
and
wept
bitterly
chapter
x
in
the
palace
garden
the
wife
of
pilate
arose
from
her
couch
with
a
troubled
and
haggard
look
on
her
fair
face
the
maid
who
attended
the
great
lady
s
toilet
observed
this
with
curiosity
there
is
tumult
about
the
gates
of
the
palace
this
morning
she
said
as
she
combed
out
the
long
blonde
tresses
with
a
comb
of
gold
and
ivory
preparatory
to
weaving
them
into
a
graceful
crown
of
braided
strands
the
princess
shrugged
her
fair
shoulders
with
a
slight
gesture
of
weariness
there
is
always
tumult
she
said
languidly
ah
me
tis
a
dreary
jerusalem
i
would
i
were
once
more
safely
at
if
my
noble
lady
will
but
glance
into
the
mirror
she
will
behold
a
fairer
sight
than
even
rome
can
offer
said
the
maid
obsequiously
and
skilfully
fastened
a
rose
so
that
its
crimson
petals
rested
on
the
white
neck
of
her
mistress
but
the
tumult
of
this
morning
differs
from
that
of
other
days
honorable
princess
she
went
on
eagerly
diomed
says
that
the
jews
have
seized
their
prophet
and
are
about
to
put
him
to
indeed
they
are
what
prophet
girl
demanded
the
lady
a
faint
flush
stealing
into
her
pale
cheeks
every
man
is
a
a
priest
is
it
not
so
in
this
hateful
jerusalem
and
the
prophets
have
loud
voices
and
they
are
always
creating
a
i
myself
have
seen
this
man
said
the
girl
he
is
quite
unlike
the
other
rabbis
as
they
call
a
gentle
voice
and
a
stature
majestic
i
bethought
me
of
my
gods
in
athens
yet
is
the
man
a
his
name
his
name
is
jesus
also
they
call
him
the
the
princess
uttered
a
faint
exclamation
pardon
me
i
beseech
thee
honorable
mistress
if
i
have
fastened
that
last
plait
too
tightly
hastily
interposed
the
maid
withdrawing
a
jeweled
pin
from
its
place
and
readjusting
it
with
elaborate
care
didst
thou
say
they
were
bringing
the
nazarene
the
palace
demanded
the
princess
turning
her
large
dark
eyes
upon
her
servant
honorable
lady
the
man
is
already
here
and
my
lord
the
governor
is
attending
the
case
without
upon
the
seat
of
judgment
the
jews
refused
to
await
the
proper
hour
and
my
lord
pilate
with
his
wonted
indulgence
came
forth
to
them
these
barbarians
have
no
hearts
noble
lady
they
are
without
consideration
for
the
sleep
of
an
illustrious
roman
they
should
be
scourged
as
what
will
they
do
with
him
muttered
the
wife
of
pilate
clenching
her
white
hands
nay
my
lord
should
have
nought
to
do
with
this
prophet
he
must
dismiss
the
the
maid
stared
at
her
mistress
in
some
perplexity
the
morning
is
warm
and
fair
she
said
at
last
will
it
please
your
highness
to
breakfast
upon
the
terrace
the
lady
felicia
is
already
playing
in
the
garden
of
the
inner
in
the
secluded
spot
where
slaves
had
spread
a
table
with
the
service
of
the
princess
the
morning
sun
struck
sparks
of
splendor
from
burnished
plates
and
crystal
goblets
flowers
of
every
delicate
color
and
odor
violets
from
gethsemane
lilies
from
the
deep
vale
of
kedron
roses
from
the
nearer
gardens
of
the
palace
heaped
a
golden
bowl
in
the
center
while
around
it
glowed
the
richer
hues
of
fruit
brought
from
distant
parts
of
the
country
and
flagons
of
delicate
wine
cooling
in
beds
of
snow
fetched
from
the
crown
of
lebanon
for
this
spoiled
daughter
of
rome
the
lady
cast
a
dissatisfied
glance
about
the
garden
where
is
felicia
she
asked
sharply
she
was
here
but
a
moment
ago
noble
lady
replied
the
maid
who
had
followed
her
mistress
with
a
fan
of
peacock
s
feathers
and
an
armful
of
embroidered
pillows
i
will
call
but
neither
oonah
nor
the
child
were
anywhere
to
be
found
and
after
a
little
the
princess
began
her
repast
with
frowning
brows
there
is
too
much
noise
about
the
place
she
observed
in
a
displeased
tone
as
she
tasted
a
silver
fig
smothered
in
wine
and
spices
the
servants
glanced
at
one
another
with
lifted
brows
it
can
not
be
helped
honorable
mistress
ventured
one
of
them
a
young
greek
lad
beautiful
as
a
creation
of
praxitiles
in
his
short
tunic
bordered
with
blue
all
the
jews
of
the
city
it
would
seem
headed
by
their
priests
are
surrounding
the
before
the
palace
the
guard
would
not
have
admitted
them
but
my
lord
the
governor
ordered
he
could
not
do
otherwise
said
the
lady
with
a
slight
curl
of
her
haughty
lip
but
what
is
it
that
they
are
saying
over
and
again
tis
a
horrid
sound
like
the
cry
of
wolves
hungering
after
their
again
the
servants
exchanged
glances
and
again
the
beautiful
young
greek
answered
his
lady
tis
a
custom
in
this
jerusalem
for
the
governor
to
release
a
prisoner
at
feast
time
he
said
in
a
low
voice
perchance
the
people
are
demanding
this
pledge
from
the
illustrious
the
lady
s
face
cleared
ah
it
is
so
she
cried
i
remember
how
it
befell
last
year
my
lord
will
release
to
them
the
nazarene
who
is
called
jesus
is
it
not
so
diomed
the
greek
hesitated
and
in
the
moment
of
silence
the
child
felicia
closely
followed
by
her
nurse
rushed
into
the
garden
her
golden
hair
was
disordered
and
her
blue
eyes
reddened
with
angry
tears
they
shall
not
scourge
the
boy
she
cried
stamping
her
small
foot
i
have
said
it
but
that
stupid
wicked
marcus
declares
that
he
will
do
it
wilt
thou
not
send
for
him
mother
and
cause
him
to
be
punished
for
disobeying
me
the
princess
turned
her
eyes
severely
upon
oonah
where
hath
the
child
been
and
what
is
all
this
about
marcus
what
has
happened
oonah
trembled
under
the
cold
looks
of
her
mistress
tis
the
beggar
boy
again
she
faltered
he
was
beating
upon
the
door
of
the
outer
court
like
a
mad
thing
and
demanding
speech
with
your
highness
but
of
course
marcus
is
a
animal
again
interrupted
felicia
passionately
listen
to
me
princess
i
can
explain
everything
far
better
than
this
stupid
oonah
dost
thou
not
remember
the
beggar
lad
whose
eyes
were
restored
by
a
king
named
jesus
i
brought
him
to
this
very
spot
days
ago
the
boy
amused
me
with
his
story
but
oonah
thrust
him
forth
i
remember
said
the
wife
of
pilate
with
a
strange
look
what
then
the
mob
wish
to
kill
his
master
the
king
and
the
lad
came
hither
to
beg
his
life
marcus
was
about
to
scourge
him
and
thrust
him
forth
but
i
forbade
it
i
say
he
shall
not
harm
the
boy
do
thou
command
it
also
my
quickly
for
marcus
will
not
obey
fetch
the
lad
to
me
diomed
ordered
the
lady
briefly
the
young
greek
obeyed
and
presently
returned
to
the
presence
of
his
mistress
followed
by
the
irate
porter
his
big
hand
buried
in
the
rough
curls
of
the
beggar
s
head
tor
presented
a
pitiable
appearance
his
pallid
face
streaked
with
tears
and
dust
his
great
eyes
wide
with
fear
and
horror
at
sight
of
the
princess
the
child
fell
sobbing
to
his
knees
and
lifted
his
lean
arms
in
an
agony
of
petition
my
master
he
wailed
and
again
my
master
oh
my
master
the
wife
of
pilate
signed
to
marcus
to
release
the
boy
then
she
ordered
diomed
to
give
him
wine
tor
obediently
swallowed
from
the
cup
which
was
held
to
his
lips
but
not
once
did
he
remove
his
beseeching
eyes
from
the
beautiful
haughty
face
of
the
princess
thou
canst
save
him
he
whispered
the
lady
shook
her
head
i
fear
that
i
can
not
she
said
then
to
the
astonishment
of
every
one
present
she
laid
her
delicate
hand
on
the
beggar
s
rough
head
tell
me
why
thou
dost
love
this
nazarene
she
asked
softly
nay
do
not
weep
and
tremble
so
child
i
will
do
all
that
i
can
to
save
tor
choked
back
his
tears
and
gazed
steadfastly
into
the
exquisite
troubled
face
which
leaned
toward
him
i
love
he
he
faltered
he
opened
my
eyes
he
is
good
he
is
the
master
i
love
why
do
the
jews
hate
him
so
murmured
the
lady
in
my
dream
i
saw
one
altogether
lovely
enthroned
high
above
all
the
gods
of
rome
and
greece
then
i
she
broke
off
with
a
shudder
the
wild
tumult
of
voices
in
the
square
without
had
risen
into
an
awful
insistent
iteration
of
one
terrible

satirical
curl
of
his
handsome
lips

the

noble

he
began
hurriedly
answering
the
command
in
the
eyes
of
his
mistress

whole

at

doors
demanding
the
crucifixion
of

of

and
would

if

the

it
was
impossible
to

those
awful
cries
penetrated
the
ears
of

very
slaves
so
that
they
cowered
and
trembled

the

with
shaking
fingers
she
wrote

she
arose
and
was
descending
the
steps
of
the
terrace
when
the
child

flung
herself
at
her
mother

knees
with
a
scream
of
terror

out
into

dreadful
place

begged

and

governor
of

seated
upon
the
ivory
chair
of
office
before
the
palace
came
the
message
of
his
wife
he
glanced
down
at
it
with
some
impatience
when
diomed
thrust
the
tablets
into
his
hand
with
a
hurried
word
of
explanation
have
thou
nothing
to
do
with
that
righteous
man
he
read
for
i
have
suffered
many
things
this
day
in
a
dream
because
of
the
message
was
signed
and
sealed
with
the
signet
of
the
roman
princess
pilate
s
pallid
and
heavy
face
whitened
to
the
lifeless
hues
of
the
wax
upon
which
the
fateful
words
were
written
before
him
stood
the
drooping
but
still
majestic
figure
of
the
nazarene
robed
in
the
purple
robe
of
his
torture
and
wearing
the
crown
of
thorns
a
piteous
sight
before
which
angels
were
vailing
their
shamed
faces
beyond
the
strong
cordon
of
the
roman
guard
surged
the
wildest
cruelest
mob
of
all
the
ages
the
governor
rose
to
his
feet
slowly
and
advancing
to
the
side
of
the
prisoner
exclaimed
in
his
loud
passionless
voice
behold
the
man
mocking
laughter
furious
incoherent
shouts
coupled
with
the
dreadful
insistent
crucify
him
crucify
him
burst
out
in
wilder
clamor
pilate
looked
forth
over
the
sea
of
terrible
upturned
eyes
and
his
huge
limbs
trembled
beneath
him
again
he
glanced
at
the
pale
melancholy
face
of
the
prisoner
the
fellow
is
naught
but
a
jewish
peasant
he
assured
himself
and
after
all
what
use
to
cast
roman
justice
before
dogs
they
will
have
none
of
loudly
he
called
for
water
in
a
basin
and
in
sight
of
them
all
washed
his
hands
with
spectacular
solemnity
saying
i
am
innocent
of
the
blood
of
this
just
person
see
ye
to
it
back
came
the
mocking
inhuman
cry
his
blood
be
upon
us
and
upon
our
children
pilate
ground
his
teeth
in
impotent
rage
and
seizing
jesus
roughly
by
the
shoulder
he
thrust
him
forward
in
the
face
of
the
mob
shall
i
crucify
your
king
he
shouted
derisively
we
have
no
king
but
cæsar
was
the
blasphemous
answer
and
with
that
word
was
the
scroll
rolled
up
and
sealed
with
the
seven
seals
of
wrath
against
the
day
of
wrath
and
they
took
jesus
and
led
him
away
on
that
same
day
tor
was
again
a
prisoner
the
wife
of
pilate
in
real
pity
had
commanded
that
the
child
should
be
comfortably
entertained
in
the
servants

until
all
should
be
over

to

the
carrying

softly
to
the
beggar
in
the
presence
of
his
mistress
bidding
him

out
of

aloud
in

said

for

was
exhausted
with
fear
and
weeping
the
sun
shone
warm
and
friendly
from
the
cloudless
spring
heavens
and
the
child
lying
upon
a
rug
which
one
of
the
slaves
had
flung
down
for
him
drowsily
watched
the
ceaseless
dance
of
young
grape
leaves
in
the
soft
warm
wind
the
tumult
without
had
suddenly
ceased
and
an
ominous
silence
lay
heavily
upon
the
city
tor
thought
lovingly
of
his
master
in
the
intervals
between
dreams
he
has
gone
away
safely
with
the
men
he
told
himself
i

again

him
and
he

heal
blind
folk
as
so
drowsing
and
murmuring
soft
prayers
to
his
invisible
father
the
beggar
child
rested
in
the
house
of
pilate
while
without
the
walls
of
the
city
his
master
the
king
was
already
hanging
upon
the
cross
within
the
great
kitchens
of
the
palace
cooks
were
busy
preparing
the
noonday
meal
dishes
and
cups
clattered
cheerfully
and
the
merry
voices
of
maidens
burnishing
the
great
mingled
with
the
chirp
and
whir
of
sparrows
flitting
back
and
forth
in
the
blue
air
suddenly
and
without
warning
the
bright
light
of
the
spring
noon
began
to
fail
there
was
no
fog
no
storm
but
a
veil
of
lurid
darkness
was
drawn
heavily
across
the
sky
doors
and
windows
were
thrown
wide
and
faces
stared
up
into
the
threatening
heavens
marcus
the
crusty
porter
of
the
palace
stood
fast
in
his
place
his
dull
face
blanched
and
terrified
in
the
failing
light
tis
the
vengeance
of
the
gods
he
muttered
the
man
of
nazareth
was
innocent
servants
and
underlings
crowded
the
passages
in
terrified
groups
open
to
us
marcus
they
cried
beating
upon
the
doors
till
they
trembled
upon
their
heavy
hinges
earthquake
wailed
a
voice
from
without
the
gods
are
shaking
this
evil
city
the
porter
drew
the
great
bolts
with
tremulous
haste
and
with
one
accord
all
rushed
into
the
street
scarcely
knowing
how
it
had
befallen
the
beggar
child
found
himself
on
the
street
with
the
others
he
knew
not
whither
through
empty
streets
which
echoed
his
light
footfalls
as
in
the
dead
of
night
somewhere
afar
off
there
was
the
tumult
of
a
great
multitude
tor
stopped
to
listen
then
ran
on
thinking
of
his
master
who
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
darkness
he
reached
a
gate
he
knew
not
but
it
yawned
wide
and
unguarded
not
far
away
tor
could
hear
the
frightened
sobbing
of
women
the
strong
curses
of
terrified
men
the
wailing
of
little
children
blending
with
the
hurried
trampling
of
myriad
feet
suddenly
athwart
the
darkness
flamed
a
silent
flash
illumining
the
heavens
from
east
to
west
against
this
lurid
background
loomed
three
crosses
stark
and
black
and
now
across
the
gloomy
valleys
sounded
the
sullen
crash
of
rocks
the
fall
of
giant
trees
while
the
sick
earth
groaned
aloud
and
trembled
beneath
its
terrible
burden
tor
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
road
in
that
instant
of
frozen
horror
he
comprehended
what
had
happened
oh
my
father
he
groaned
the
foundations
of
his
childish
faith
reeling
with
the
reeling
earth
and
the
omnipotent
love
answered
this
feeble
cry
of
the
least
of
his
children
even
as
it
answered
that
agonized
appeal
which
was
sounding
forth
from
calvary
and
so
in
a
an
heavens
cleared
and
the
april
sun
shone
brightly
upon
the
crosses
with
their
piteous
burdens
upon
the
multitudes
returning
to
doomed
jerusalem
upon
riven
tombs
and
shattered
mountains
upon
a
little
child
comforted
of
his
father
gazing
with
eyes
upon
the
cross
of
his
king
they
took
away
the
body
of
jesus
before
sunset
wrapping
it
in
fine
white
linen
and
odorous
spices
and
laying
it
to
rest
in
a
garden
hard
by
tor
watched
all
understanding
little
of
the
significance
of
the
tomb
of
the
great
stone
before
its
door
of
the
roman
guard
which
was
shortly
stationed
before
the
sealed
sepulchre
illustration
his
wicked
face
disfigured
with
rage
and
when
all
was
finished
the
child
returned
to
the
city
sustained
by
some
strange
expectation
which
he
could
have
explained
to
no
one
as
he
would
have
entered
the
gate
he
came
upon
a
woeful
figure
standing
without
and
beating
upon
its
breast
it
was
chelluh
his
wicked
face
disfigured
with
rage
and
pain
my
eyes
he
groaned
the
sight
of
that
accursed
cross
burnt
them
like
a
devouring
and
so
it
was
and
so
will
it
ever
be
he
who
can
look
upon
that
cross
of
agony
without
tears
of
love
and
pity
henceforth
sees
only
the
blackness
of
darkness
the
eyes
of
his
soul
are
withered
tor
led
the
blind
man
to
his
old
place
by
the
gate
and
fetched
him
his
cup
his
staff
and
his
now
go
little
dog
buy
me
oil
and
wine
cried
the
beggar
with
one
of
his
frightful
maledictions
and
return
to
me
quickly
for
i
am
devoured
with
this
but
tor
looking
upon
him
sorrowfully
knew
that
he
could
no
more
serve
this
evil
master
as
in
the
old
days
i
have
done
thus
far
for
thee
he
said
in
his
clear
childish
voice
because
of
the
king
my
master
and
because
of
my
father
in
heaven
but
i
can
no
longer
abide
in
thy
presence
farewell
and
with
this
he
was
gone
his
naked
feet
making
no
sound
upon
the
stones
of
the
street
many
days
thereafter
did
chelluh
send
forth
his
dolorous
cry
for
alms
in
the
doomed
city
of
jerusalem
for
he
lived
until
the
terrible
days
of
the
roman
siege
perishing
at
last
of
hunger
in
his
chosen
place
by
the
damascus
gate
in
the
green
hard
by
calvary
where
the
roman
guard
paced
ceaselessly
back
and
forth
before
that
silent
tomb
tor
lingered
unnoticed
and
unafraid
as
the
birds
that
flitted
among
the
branches
of
the
blossoming
trees
it
comforted
him
to
be
near
the
of
his
master
and
the
lusty
life
of
the
young
summer
sent
vague
thrills
of
expectancy
through
his
brown
limbs
as
he
lay
upon
the
warm
earth
watching
the
shifting
playing
upon
the
sealed
door
of
the
sepulchre
and
the
figures
of
the
guard
clad
in
the
scarlet
and
gold
of
imperial
rome
toward
midnight
of
the
second
night
when
the
great
passover
moon
rode
high
in
the
heavens
and
the
garden
slept
in
its
silver
light
like
the
garden
of
a
dream
the
child
slept
too
held
in
the
soft
clasp
of
a
vision
which
laid
cool
fingers
of
delight
on
his
drowsy
lids
when
he
awoke
he
lay
for
a
full
minute
staring
into
the
branches
of
the
above
his
head
the
leaves
were
all
alive
with
a
tremulous
motion
in
the
fresh
morning
breeze
a
bird
trilled
softly
somewhere
in
the
depths
of
the
garden
the
aromatic
breath
of
serried
lilies
swept
his
cheek
like
a
caress
it
was
happiness
to
have
be
once
more
awake
then
he
remembered
the
roman
guard
had
disappeared
this
much
tor
perceived
at
a
single
glance
a
second
searching
stare
told
him
much
more
the
door
of
the
tomb
gaped
wide
beside
it
stood
a
young
man
clad
in
white
garments
tor
approached
this
radiant
figure
unafraid
where
is
the
man
who
opens
eyes
he
asked
quite
simply
for
the
empty
tomb
appeared
nothing
strange
to
the
child
newly
emerged
from
his
healing
dreams
he
is
not
here
the
young
man
made
answer
with
grave
sweetness
he
is
risen
as
he
said
behold
he
goeth
before
you
into
galilee
there
shalt
thou
see
tor
opened
wide
eyes
of
rapture
upon
the
angel
my
master
is
alive
he
whispered
to
himself
i
shall
see
he
turned
as
if
in
a
dream
his
naked
feet
making
no
sound
as
he
brushed
light
as
the
dawn
past
the
ranks
of
lilies
there
was
a
woman
yonder
she
was
weeping
with
a
smothered
sound
of
sobs
tor
laughed
softly
in
his
joy
he
is
alive
he
repeated
under
his
breath
then
he
saw
with
wonder
that
the
woman
was
no
longer
alone
she
was
speaking
to
the
risen
one
her
voice
wrenched
with
sobbing
sir
if
thou
hast
borne
him
hence
tell
me
where
thou
hast
laid
him
and
i
will
take
him
the
child
s
eyes
knew
him
though
the
woman
did
not
he
sank
to
his
knees
his
face
shining
with
the
dazzling
light
of
the
new
day
chapter

by

water
to
peter
broken
in
spirit
bowed
down
with
the
shame
of
his
repeated
denials
sleepless
with
torturing
memories
of
his
dead
master
came
mary
of
magdala
at
dawn
of
the
first
day
of
the
week
they
have
taken
away
the
lord
out
of
the
tomb
she
sobbed
and
i
know
not
where
they
have
laid
peter
arose
at
that
word
and
girded
his
garments
about
him
that
he
might
run
swiftly
to
the
spot
he
had
no
thought
of
what
he
should
do
but
a
blind
anguish
of
desire
to
serve
the
master
he
had
scorned
drove
him
forth
like
a
scourge
he
scarce
noticed
that
john
the
beloved
disciple
was
with
him
running
evenly
at
his
side
then
some
murmured
word
of
that
other
disciple
brought
a
faint
memory
of
words
spoken
and
straightway
forgotten
words
of
painful
prophecy
of
unearthly
hope
which
he
himself
had
rejected
with
scorn
and
impatience
the
galilean
faltered
lagged
behind
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
john
was
first
to
reach
the
open
tomb
the
rosy
light
of
the
new
day
shone
softly
into
the
shadowy
sepulchre
revealing
the
walls
the
shallow
niche
wherein
the
body
had
lain
the
folded
the
scattered
spices
the
place
was
fragrant
bright
mysteriously
empty
peter
stared
in
at
the
small
still
empty
place
those
memories
stirring
strangely
within
him
when
i
have
arisen
from
the
dead
he
murmured
half
unconsciously
had
the
master
indeed
uttered
those
strange
words
or
was
his
brain
touched
with
some
sweet
madness
he
turned
to
john
the
eyes
of
the
beloved
disciple
were
fastened
upon
the
empty
niche
his
lips
moved
as
in
prayer
with
sudden
resolution
peter
entered
the
tomb
stooping
to
look
more
closely
at
the
chill
empty
bed
with
its
array
of
fair
linen
and
odorous
spicery
he
noticed
with
an
awed
tightening
of
the
throat
that
the
fine
linen
napkin
which
had
been
wound
about
the
dead
man
s
head
was
not
lying
with
the
other
cerements
but
was
folded
carefully
apart
as
if
the
wearer
sitting
upon
the
edge
of
his
couch
had
placed
it
there
with
a
tender
thought
of
the
giver
his
bewildered
eyes
met
the
look
of
dawning
hope
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
he
is
not
here
murmured
john
he
is
risen
and
on
a
sudden
his
face
became
radiant
with
angelic
beauty
then
the
two
went
away
in
wondering
silence
to
their
own
house
and
as
they
went
they
met
other
women
of
their
company
who
told
them
of
angels
waiting
within
the
tomb
with
that
question
which
still
sounds
in
ears
against
the
truth
of
omnipresent
life
why
seek
ye
the
living
among
the
dead
go
tell
his
disciples
and
peter
he
goeth
before
you
into
galilee
there
shall
ye
see
him
as
he
said
unto
to
galilee
therefore
after
certain
days
of
growing
hope
and
marvelous
vision
the
disciples
journeyed
in
great
numbers
and
with
them
went
a
certain
small
lad
of
a
joyous
and
shining
face
no
longer
a
homeless
beggar
of
jerusalem
but
a
brother
beloved
because
he
had
looked
upon
the
king
in
the
beauty
of
his
resurrection
body
it
was
one
of
the
women
called
salome
who
first
came
upon
the
child
as
he
walked
slowly
toward
jerusalem
in
the
dawning
day
the
little
lad
was
chanting
softly
to
himself
the
words
he
had
learned
on
the
day
of
his
healing
hosanna
hosanna
in
the
highest
is
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
king
why
dost
thou
sing
child
asked
the
woman
querulously
she
was
still
bearing
the
burden
of
spicery
which
she
had
fetched
to
the
empty
tomb
and
her
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
and
anxiety
i
sing
answered
tor
because
my
master
the
king
is
alive
he
opened
my
eyes
which
were
blind
as
night
and
with
these
eyes
have
i
seen
therefore
i
the
woman
shook
her
head
sorrowfully
for
the
thing
was
yet
too
wonderful
for
her
understanding
i
have
seen
the
empty
tomb
she
said
also
i
beheld
a
young
man
clad
in
white
garments
who
declared
to
us
that
he
was
alive
but
i
know
not
what
to
think
how
can
it
be
that
he
is
alive
when
he
was
with
a
spear
and
again
she
wept
bitterly
i
saw
him
said
tor
simply
the
man
who
opened
my
eyes
he
is
alive
i
am
going
to
galilee
to
see
and
once
more
the
child
cried
hosanna
with
a
clear
jubilant
voice
whose
child
art
thou
little
one
said
the
woman
marveling
at
the
brightness
of
his
eyes
which
indeed
shone
like
the
eyes
of
the
angel
at
the
empty
tomb
and
where
dost
thou
live
i
have
a
father
in
heaven
said
tor
and
once
i
had
a
master
who
was
blind
and
a
beggar
but
him
i
serve
no
longer
since
i
serve
only
the
king
who
gave
me
my
and
when
by
dint
of
questioning
the
lad
the
woman
found
that
he
was
without
kindred
and
alone
in
the
world
she
took
him
to
her
own
house
and
so
it
happened
that
tor
traveled
with
that
great
concourse
of
disciples
who
went
to
galilee
to
keep
the
tryst
with
their
risen
lord
again
tor
met
peter
the
galilean
it
was
on
this
wise
the
child
enchanted
with
the
beauty
of
the
lake
wandered
upon
the
shore
at
evening
his
eyes
wistfully
following
the
fishermen
as
they
put
out
one
after
another
upon
the
radiant
water
i
should
like
to
sail
away
in
a
boat
murmured
tor
to
himself
he
looked
up
to
find
the
eyes
of
peter
fixed
upon
him
how
camest
thou
hither
small
one
asked
the
fisherman
i
came
from
jerusalem
with
the
woman
who
is
called
salome
answered
tor
i
am
come
to
see
my
master
who
was
dead
and
is
alive
again
already
i
have
seen
him
and
i
shall
again
see
him
perhaps
he
added
timidly
he
is
the
child
s
small
finger
pointed
to
the
lake
which
glowed
like
a
sea
of
lambent
fire
in
the
dying
light
once
he
came
to
us
walking
upon
the
water
said
the
fisherman
thoughtfully
after
a
little
his
eyes
wandered
to
his
boats
drawn
high
and
empty
upon
the
shore
there
were
others
of
his
old
comrades
near
at
hand
and
to
these
peter
presently
called
out
with
something
of
his
old
energy
i
go
a
fishing
he
said
they
answered
we
also
go
with
and
so
the
boat
was
made
ready
with
nets
and
lanterns
and
rough
fisher
s
gear
for
possible
wild
weather
in
the
night
watches
tor
watched
the
preparations
with
shining
eyes
when
all
was
at
length
finished
he
bowed
himself
before
peter
after
his
old
mendicant
s
fashion
i
pray
thee
honorable
galilean
that
i
also
may
go
fishing
he
said
timidly
peter
stared
down
at
him
in
some
perplexity
what
is
it
that
brings
thee
ever
athwart
my
path
small
one
he
asked
not
unkindly
in
jerusalem
thou
wast
verily
like
my
now
thou
wilt
i
want
to
see
my
master
the
king
answered
tor
he
is
again
the
small
finger
pointed
to
the
darkening
lake
and
the
solemn
blue
mountains
beyond
it
is
so
beautiful
he
will
be
there
he
repeated
softly
come
then
said
peter
and
catching
up
the
little
lad
he
stowed
him
snugly
in
the
bow
of
the
great
clumsy
amid
a
pile
of
nets
through
stretches
of
moonlit
water
where
the
breeze
rippled
keenly
in
the
dark
lee
of
swelling
hills
now
anchored
now
drifting
slowly
under
the
winking
stars
the
fishermen
bent
to
their
work
and
through
the
long
hours
tor
lay
quite
still
in
the
place
where
he
was
bid
speaking
to
no
one
but
wrapped
in
a
dream
of
perfect
delight
which
the
men
busied
with
their
fruitless
fishing
could
scarce
have
understood
when
now
the
darkest
hour
that
comes
before
dawn
was
already
past
and
the
white
mist
that
shrouded
sea
and
shore
and
drifted
light
as
down
upon
the
glassy
surface
of
the
nearer
water
began
to
glow
with
rose
and
amber
tints
of
dawn
tor
wriggled
his
lithe
little
body
from
its
nest
of
coats
and
stood
upright
in
the
bow
his
great
bright
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
wavering
curtains
of
the
mist
listen
he
cried
suddenly
in
his
clear
shrill
voice
a
long
level
ray
from
the
rising
sun
burst
through
the
vanishing
clouds
and
rested
full
upon
the
land
not
many
furlongs
distant
look
cried
the
child
again
and
pointed
with
his
finger
some
standing
upon
the
pebbly
shore
looking
out
over
the
water
the
fishermen
rubbed
their
tired
eyes
and
stared
children
have
ye
aught
to
eat
a
clear
human
voice
brought
the
little
cheerful
question
across
the
narrowing
space
no
shouted
the
fishermen
satisfied
that
the
friendly
voice
belonged
to
some
wayfarer
curious
as
ever
to
know
the
luck
of
an
fishing
expedition
cast
the
net
on
the
right
side
of
the
boat
and
ye
shall
find
came
the
answer
perchance
he
sees
the
ripple
of
a
shoal
muttered
peter
and
heaved
the
great
net
for
another
cast
and
now
the
net
sank
with
its
weight
of
struggling
fish
two
of
the
men
leaped
hastily
into
the
small
boat
to
secure
the
catch
but
peter
and
john
were
gazing
past
the
heaving
net
at
that
solitary
figure
upon
the
shore
it
is
the
lord
whispered
john
and
peter
with
a
smothered
cry
of
love
and
longing
girt
his
fisher
s
coat
about
him
and
flung
himself
into
the
water
upon
the
shore
burned
a
fire
of
coals
and
upon
it
sputtered
a
great
fish
giving
forth
appetizing
odors
to
the
cool
morning
air
beside
the
fire
were
piled
loaves
such
as
the
common
people
were
wont
to
use
with
this
broiled
fish
it
was
all
quite
homely
and
natural
yet
the
hands
that
busied
themselves
with
that
simple
satisfying
meal
bore
the
mark
of
the
nails
the
fishermen
stood
with
bowed
heads
no
one
daring
to
ask
the
question
which
trembled
on
every
lip
come
and
break
your
fast
said
their
mysterious
host
smiling
upon
their
silence
and
he
took
the
bread
and
the
fish
and
gave
them
to
eat
so
when
they
had
broken
their
fast
jesus
said
to
simon
peter
simon
son
of
john
lovest
thou
me
more
than
these
peter
answered
in
a
half
whisper
yea
lord
thou
knowest
that
i
love
jesus
said
feed
my
he
said
to
him
a
second
time
simon
son
of
john
lovest
thou
me
again
peter
answered
with
an
anguished
glance
of
entreaty
yea
lord
thou
knowest
that
i
love
again
came
the
command
feed
my
he
said
to
him
the
third
time
simon
son
of
john
lovest
thou
me
then
peter
burst
into
a
great
passion
of
weeping
and
wept
as
on
the
night
he
had
denied
his
master
lord
he
cried
out
thou
knowest
all
things
thou
knowest
that
i
love
thee
jesus
said
feed
my
other
words
spake
he
also
which
they
that
heard
forgot
no
more
either
in
time
or
in
eternity
thus
did
peter
the
galilean
who
was
also
called
simon
son
of
john
answer
his
master
three
times
by
gennesaret
water
and
thus
was
the
bitter
memory
of
his
three
denials
purged
from
his
soul
verily
he
loved
much
and
was
therefore
forgiven
much
and
to
the
end
of
his
days
he
remembered
right
well
both
to
cherish
the
lambs
committed
to
his
care
by
the
upper
shepherd
and
to
tend
and
feed
the
sheep
both
in
fold
and
in
pasture
so
it
was
that
he
no
more
spoke
carelessly
or
slightingly
to
the
little
lad
tor
but
counting
him
as
a
special
charge
from
his
risen
lord
he
became
to
him
even
as
a
father
and
tor
growing
into
manhood
learned
many
things
both
strange
and
beautiful
from
the
world
s
page
but
he
found
nothing
there
to
blot
out
the
memory
of
the
man
who
had
opened
his
eyes
to
the
end
he
followed
the
king
his
master
and
jesus
long
since
received
into
the
visible
heavens
over
galilee
yet
remained
with
him
a
sweet
and
satisfying
presence
