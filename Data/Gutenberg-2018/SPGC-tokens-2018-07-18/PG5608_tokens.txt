the
trial
of
the
witnesses
of
the
resurrection
of
jesus
christ
not
only
woolston
objections
in
his
sixth
discourse
on
our
saviour
miracles
but
those
also
which
he
and
others
have
published
in
other
books
are
here
considered
first
published
about
the
year
the
t
r
i
a
l
of
the
witnesses
of
the
resurrection
of
jesus
we
were
not
long
since
some
gentlemen
of
the
inns
of
court
together
each
to
other
so
well
known
that
no
man
presence
was
a
confinement
to
any
other
from
speaking
his
mind
on
any
subject
that
happened
to
arise
in
conversation
the
meeting
was
without
design
and
the
discourse
as
in
like
cases
various
among
other
things
we
fell
upon
the
subject
of
woolston
trial
and
conviction
which
had
happened
some
few
days
before
that
led
to
a
debate
how
the
law
finds
in
such
cases
what
punishment
it
inflicts
and
in
general
whether
the
law
ought
at
all
to
interpose
in
controversies
of
this
kind
we
were
not
agreed
in
these
points
one
who
maintained
the
favorable
side
to
woolston
discovered
a
great
liking
and
approbation
of
his
discourses
against
the
miracles
of
christ
and
seemed
to
think
his
arguments
unanswerable
to
which
another
replied
i
wonder
that
one
of
your
abilities
and
bred
to
the
profession
of
the
law
which
teaches
us
to
consider
the
nature
of
evidence
and
its
proper
weight
can
be
of
that
opinion
i
am
sure
you
would
be
unwilling
to
determine
a
property
of
five
shillings
upon
such
evidence
as
you
now
think
material
enough
to
overthrow
the
miracles
of
christ
it
may
easily
be
imagined
that
this
opened
a
door
to
much
dispute
and
determined
the
conversation
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening
to
this
subject
the
dispute
ran
thro
almost
all
the
particulars
mentioned
in
woolston
pieces
but
the
thread
of
it
was
broken
by
several
digressions
and
the
pursuit
of
things
which
were
brought
accidentally
into
the
discourse
at
length
one
of
the
company
said
pleasantly
gentlemen
you
do
argue
like
lawyers
if
i
were
judge
in
this
cause
i
would
hold
you
better
to
the
point
the
company
took
the
hint
and
cried
they
should
be
glad
to
have
the
cause
reheard
and
him
to
be
the
judge
the
gentlemen
who
had
engaged
with
mettle
and
spirit
in
a
dispute
which
arose
accidentally
seemed
very
unwilling
to
be
drawn
into
a
formal
controversy
and
especially
the
gentleman
who
argued
against
woolston
thought
the
matter
grew
too
serious
for
him
and
excused
himself
from
undertaking
a
controversy
in
religion
of
all
others
the
most
momentous
but
he
was
told
that
the
argument
should
be
confined
merely
to
the
nature
of
the
evidence
and
that
might
be
considered
without
entering
into
any
such
controversy
as
he
would
avoid
and
to
bring
the
matter
within
bounds
and
under
one
view
the
evidence
of
christ
resurrection
and
the
exceptions
taken
to
it
should
be
the
only
subject
of
the
conference
with
such
persuasion
he
suffered
himself
to
be
persuaded
and
promised
to
give
the
company
and
their
judge
a
meeting
that
day
fortnight
the
judge
and
the
rest
of
the
company
were
for
bringing
on
the
cause
a
week
sooner
but
the
council
for
woolston
took
the
matter
up
and
said
consider
sir
the
gentleman
is
not
to
argue
out
of
littleton
plowden
or
coke
authors
to
him
well
known
but
he
must
have
his
authorities
from
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
and
a
fortnight
is
time
little
enough
of
all
conscience
to
gain
a
familiarity
with
a
new
acquaintance
and
turning
to
the
gentleman
he
said
i
call
upon
you
before
the
fortnight
is
out
to
see
how
reverend
an
appearance
you
make
behind
hammond
on
the
new
testament
a
concordance
on
one
hand
and
a
folio
bible
with
references
on
the
other
you
shall
be
welcome
sir
replied
the
gentleman
and
perhaps
you
may
find
some
company
more
to
your
own
taste
he
is
but
a
poor
council
who
studies
on
one
side
of
the
question
only
and
therefore
i
will
have
your
friend
woolston
and
to
entertain
you
when
you
do
me
the
favor
of
the
visit
upon
this
we
parted
in
good
humour
and
all
pleased
with
the
appointment
made
except
the
two
gentlemen
who
were
to
provide
the
entertainment
the
second
day
the
company
met
at
the
time
appointed
but
as
it
happened
in
this
as
in
like
cases
it
often
does
that
some
friends
to
some
of
the
company
who
were
not
of
the
party
the
first
day
had
got
notice
of
the
meeting
and
the
gentlemen
who
were
to
debate
the
question
found
they
had
a
more
numerous
audience
than
they
expected
or
desired
he
especially
who
was
to
maintain
the
evidence
for
the
resurrection
began
to
excuse
the
necessity
he
was
under
of
disappointing
their
expectation
alledging
that
he
was
not
prepared
and
he
had
persisted
in
excusing
himself
but
that
the
strangers
who
perceived
what
the
case
was
offered
to
withdraw
which
the
gentleman
would
by
no
means
consent
to
they
insisting
to
go
he
said
he
would
much
rather
submit
himself
to
their
candour
unprepared
as
he
was
than
be
guilty
of
such
rudeness
as
to
force
them
to
leave
the
company
upon
which
one
of
the
company
smiling
said
it
happens
luckily
that
our
number
is
increased
when
we
were
last
together
we
appointed
a
judge
but
we
quite
forgot
a
jury
and
now
i
think
we
are
good
men
and
true
sufficient
to
make
one
this
thought
was
pursued
in
several
allusions
to
legal
proceedings
which
created
some
mirth
and
had
this
good
effect
that
it
dispersed
the
solemn
air
which
the
mutual
compliments
upon
the
difficulty
before
mentioned
had
introduced
and
restored
the
ease
and
good
humour
natural
to
the
conversation
of
gentlemen
the
judge
perceiving
the
disposition
of
the
company
thought
it
a
proper
time
to
begin
and
called
out
gentlemen
of
the
jury
take
your
places
and
immediately
seated
himself
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
the
company
sat
round
him
and
the
judge
called
upon
the
council
for
woolston
to
begin
a
council
for
woolston
addressing
himself
to
the
judge
said
may
it
please
your
lordship
i
conceive
the
gentleman
on
the
other
side
ought
to
begin
and
lay
his
evidence
which
he
intends
to
maintain
before
the
court
till
that
is
done
it
is
to
no
purpose
for
me
to
object
i
amy
perhaps
object
to
something
which
he
will
not
admit
to
be
any
part
of
his
evidence
and
therefore
i
apprehend
the
evidence
ought
in
the
first
place
to
be
distinctly
stated
judge
b
what
say
you
to
that
b
council
on
the
other
side
my
lord
if
the
evidence
i
am
to
maintain
were
to
suppose
any
new
claim
if
i
were
to
gain
any
thing
which
i
am
not
already
possessed
of
the
gentleman
would
be
in
the
right
but
the
evidence
is
old
and
is
matter
of
record
and
i
have
been
long
in
possession
of
all
that
i
claim
under
it
if
the
gentleman
has
anything
to
say
to
dispossess
me
let
him
produce
it
otherwise
i
have
no
reason
to
bring
my
own
title
into
question
and
this
i
take
to
be
the
known
method
of
proceeding
in
such
cases
no
man
is
obliged
to
produce
his
title
to
his
possession
it
is
sufficient
if
he
maintain
it
when
it
is
called
in
question
mr
a
surely
my
lord
the
gentleman
mistakes
the
case
i
can
never
admit
myself
to
be
out
of
possession
of
my
understanding
and
reason
and
since
he
would
put
me
out
of
this
possession
and
compel
me
to
admit
things
incredible
in
virtue
of
the
evidence
he
maintains
he
ought
to
set
forth
his
claim
or
leave
the
world
to
be
directed
by
common
sense
judge
sir
you
say
right
upon
supposition
that
the
truth
of
the
christian
religion
were
the
point
in
question
in
that
case
it
would
be
necessary
to
produce
the
evidence
for
the
christian
religion
but
the
matter
now
before
the
court
is
whether
the
objections
produced
by
woolston
are
of
weight
to
overthrow
the
evidence
of
resurrection
you
see
then
the
evidence
of
the
resurrection
is
supposed
to
be
what
it
is
on
both
sides
and
the
thing
immediately
in
judgement
is
the
value
of
the
objections
and
therefore
they
must
be
set
forth
the
court
will
be
bound
to
take
notice
of
the
evidence
which
is
admitted
as
a
fact
on
both
parts
go
on
a
my
lord
i
submit
to
the
direction
of
the
court
i
can
not
but
observe
that
the
gentleman
on
the
other
side
unwilling
as
he
seems
to
be
to
state
his
evidence
did
not
forget
to
lay
in
his
claim
to
prescription
which
is
perhaps
in
truth
tho
he
has
too
much
skill
to
own
it
the
very
strength
of
his
cause
i
do
allow
that
the
gentleman
maintains
nothing
but
what
his
father
and
grandfather
and
his
ancestors
beyond
time
of
man
memory
maintained
before
him
i
allow
too
that
prescription
in
many
cases
makes
a
good
title
but
it
must
always
be
with
this
condition
that
the
thing
is
capable
of
being
prescribed
for
and
i
insist
that
prescription
can
not
run
against
reason
and
common
sense
customs
may
be
pleaded
by
prescription
but
if
upon
showing
the
custom
anything
unreasonable
appears
in
it
the
prescription
fails
for
length
of
time
works
nothing
towards
the
establishing
anything
that
could
never
have
a
legal
commencement
and
if
this
objection
will
overthrow
all
prescriptions
for
customs
the
mischief
of
which
extends
perhaps
to
one
poor
village
only
and
affects
them
in
no
greater
a
concern
than
their
right
of
common
upon
a
ragged
mountain
shall
it
not
much
more
prevail
when
the
interest
of
mankind
is
concerned
and
in
no
less
a
point
than
his
happiness
in
this
life
and
all
his
hopes
for
futurity
besides
if
prescription
must
be
allowed
in
this
case
how
will
you
deal
with
it
in
others
what
will
you
say
to
the
ancient
persians
and
their
nay
what
to
the
turks
who
have
been
long
enough
in
possession
of
their
faith
to
plead
i
beg
pardon
for
interrupting
the
gentleman
but
it
is
to
save
him
trouble
he
is
going
into
his
favorite
and
has
brought
us
from
persia
to
turkey
already
and
if
he
goes
on
i
know
we
must
follow
him
around
the
globe
to
save
us
from
this
long
journey
i
waive
all
advantage
from
the
antiquity
of
the
resurrection
and
the
general
reception
the
belief
of
it
has
found
in
the
world
and
am
content
to
consider
it
as
a
fact
which
happened
but
last
year
and
was
never
heard
of
either
by
the
gentleman
grandfather
or
by
mine
i
should
not
have
taken
quite
so
long
a
journey
as
the
gentleman
imagines
nor
indeed
need
any
man
go
far
from
home
to
find
instances
to
the
purpose
i
was
upon
but
since
this
advantage
is
quitted
i
am
as
willing
to
spare
my
pains
as
the
gentleman
is
desirous
that
i
should
and
yet
i
suspect
some
art
even
in
this
concession
fair
and
candid
as
it
seems
to
be
for
i
am
persuaded
that
one
reason
perhaps
the
main
reason
why
men
believe
this
history
of
jesus
is
that
they
can
not
conceive
that
any
one
should
attempt
much
less
succeed
in
such
an
attempt
as
this
upon
the
foundation
of
mere
human
cunning
and
policy
and
is
worth
to
go
round
the
globe
as
the
gentleman
expressed
himself
so
see
various
instances
of
the
like
kind
in
order
to
remove
this
prejudice
but
i
stand
corrected
and
will
go
directly
to
the
point
now
in
judgement
b
my
lord
the
gentleman
in
justification
of
his
first
argument
has
entered
upon
another
of
a
very
different
kind
i
think
he
is
sensible
of
it
and
seeming
to
yield
up
one
of
his
popular
topicks
is
indeed
artfully
getting
rid
of
another
which
has
made
a
very
good
figure
in
many
late
writings
but
will
not
bear
in
any
place
where
he
who
maintains
it
may
be
asked
questions
the
mere
antiquity
of
the
resurrection
i
gave
up
for
if
the
evidence
was
not
good
at
first
it
ca
be
good
now
the
gentleman
is
willing
he
says
to
spare
us
his
history
of
ancient
errors
and
intimates
that
upon
this
account
he
passes
over
many
instances
of
fraud
that
were
in
like
circumstances
to
the
case
before
us
i
would
not
have
the
main
strength
of
his
case
betrayed
in
complaisance
to
me
nothing
can
be
more
material
than
to
show
a
fraud
of
this
kind
that
prevailed
universally
in
the
world
christ
jesus
declared
himself
a
prophet
and
put
the
proof
of
his
mission
on
this
that
he
should
die
openly
and
publickly
and
rise
again
the
third
day
this
surely
was
the
hardest
plot
in
the
world
to
be
managed
and
if
there
be
one
instance
of
this
kind
or
in
any
degree
like
it
by
all
means
let
it
be
produced
a
my
lord
there
has
hardly
been
an
instance
of
a
false
religion
in
the
world
but
it
has
also
afforded
a
like
instance
to
this
before
us
have
they
not
all
pretended
to
inspiration
upon
what
foot
did
pythagoras
numa
and
others
set
up
did
they
not
all
converse
with
the
gods
and
pretend
to
deliver
oracles
b
this
only
shews
that
revelation
is
by
the
common
consent
of
mankind
the
very
best
foundation
of
religion
and
therefore
every
imposter
pretends
to
it
but
is
a
man
hiding
himself
in
a
cave
for
some
years
and
then
coming
out
into
the
world
to
be
compared
to
a
man
dying
and
rising
to
life
again
so
far
from
it
that
you
and
i
and
every
man
may
do
the
one
but
no
man
can
do
the
other
a
sir
i
suppose
it
will
be
allowed
to
be
as
great
a
thing
to
go
to
heaven
and
converse
with
angels
and
with
god
and
to
come
down
to
earth
again
as
it
is
to
die
and
rise
again
now
this
very
thing
mahomet
pretended
to
do
and
all
his
disciples
believe
it
can
you
deny
this
fact
b
deny
it
sir
no
but
tell
us
who
went
with
mahomet
who
were
his
witnesses
i
expect
before
we
are
done
to
hear
of
the
guards
set
over
the
sepulchre
of
christ
and
the
seal
of
the
stone
what
guard
watched
mahomet
in
his
going
or
returning
what
seals
and
credentials
had
he
he
himself
pretends
to
none
his
followers
pretend
to
nothing
but
his
own
word
we
are
now
to
consider
the
evidence
for
christ
resurrection
and
you
think
to
parallel
it
by
producing
a
case
for
which
no
one
ever
pretended
there
was
any
evidence
you
have
mahomet
word
and
no
man
ever
told
a
lie
but
you
had
his
word
for
the
truth
of
what
he
said
and
therefore
you
need
not
go
round
the
globe
to
find
such
instances
as
these
but
this
story
it
is
said
has
gained
great
credit
and
is
received
by
many
nations
very
well
and
how
was
it
received
was
not
every
man
converted
to
this
faith
with
the
sword
at
his
throat
in
our
case
every
witness
to
the
resurrection
and
every
believer
of
it
was
hourly
exposed
to
death
in
the
other
case
whoever
refused
to
believe
died
or
what
was
as
bad
lived
a
wretched
conquered
slave
and
will
you
pretend
these
cases
to
be
alike
one
case
indeed
there
was
within
our
own
memory
which
in
some
circumstances
came
near
to
the
case
now
before
us
the
french
prophets
put
the
credit
of
their
mission
upon
the
resurrection
of
emmes
and
gave
publick
notice
of
it
if
the
gentleman
pleases
to
make
use
of
this
instance
it
is
at
his
service
a
the
instance
of
emmes
is
so
far
to
the
purpose
that
it
shews
to
what
lengths
enthusiasm
will
carry
men
and
why
might
not
the
same
thing
happen
at
jerusalem
which
happened
but
a
few
years
ago
in
our
own
country
matthew
and
john
and
the
rest
of
them
managed
that
affair
with
more
dexterity
than
the
french
prophets
so
that
the
resurrection
of
jesus
gained
credit
in
the
world
and
the
french
prophets
sunk
under
their
ridiculous
pretensions
that
is
all
the
difference
b
is
it
so
and
a
very
wide
difference
i
promise
you
in
one
case
everything
happened
that
was
proper
to
convince
the
world
of
the
resurrection
in
the
other
the
event
manifested
the
cheat
and
upon
the
view
of
these
circumstances
you
think
it
is
sufficient
to
say
with
great
coolness
that
is
all
the
difference
why
what
difference
do
you
expect
between
truth
and
falsehood
what
distinction
judge
gentlemen
you
forget
you
are
in
a
court
and
are
falling
into
dialogue
courts
do
allow
of
look
ye
the
evidence
of
the
resurrection
of
jesus
is
before
the
court
recorded
by
matthew
mark
and
others
you
must
take
it
as
it
is
you
can
neither
make
it
better
or
worse
these
witnesses
are
accused
of
giving
false
evidence
come
to
the
point
and
let
us
hear
what
you
have
to
offer
to
prove
the
accusation
b
is
it
your
meaning
sir
that
the
objections
should
be
stated
and
argued
all
together
and
that
the
answer
should
be
to
the
whole
at
once
or
would
you
have
the
objections
argued
singly
and
answered
separately
by
themselves
judge
i
think
this
court
may
dispense
with
the
strict
forms
of
legal
proceeding
and
therefore
i
leave
this
to
the
choice
of
the
jury
after
the
jury
had
consulted
together
the
foreman
rose
up
the
foreman
of
the
jury
we
desire
to
hear
the
objections
argued
and
answered
separately
we
shall
be
better
able
to
form
a
judgement
by
hearing
the
answer
while
the
objection
is
fresh
in
our
minds
judge
gentlemen
you
hear
the
opinion
of
the
jury
go
on
a
i
am
now
to
disclose
to
you
a
scene
of
all
others
the
most
surprising
the
resurrection
has
been
long
talked
of
and
to
the
amazement
of
everyone
who
can
think
freely
has
been
believed
through
all
ages
of
the
church
this
general
and
constant
belief
creates
in
most
minds
a
presumption
that
it
was
founded
on
good
evidence
in
other
cases
the
evidence
supports
the
credit
of
the
history
but
here
the
evidence
itself
is
presumed
only
upon
the
credit
which
the
story
has
gained
i
wish
the
books
dispersed
against
jesus
by
the
ancient
jews
had
not
been
lost
for
they
would
have
given
us
a
clear
insight
into
this
contrivance
but
it
is
happy
for
us
that
the
very
account
given
by
the
pretended
witnesses
of
this
fact
is
sufficient
to
destroy
the
credit
of
it
the
resurrection
was
not
a
thing
contrived
for
its
own
sake
no
it
was
undertaken
to
support
great
views
and
for
the
sake
of
great
consequences
that
were
to
attend
it
it
will
be
necessary
therefore
to
lay
before
you
those
views
that
you
may
be
the
better
judge
of
this
part
of
the
contrivance
when
you
have
the
whole
scene
before
you
the
jews
were
a
weak
superstitious
people
and
as
is
common
among
such
people
gave
great
credit
to
some
traditionary
prophecies
about
their
own
country
they
had
besides
some
old
books
among
them
which
they
esteemed
to
be
writings
of
certain
prophets
who
had
formerly
lived
among
them
and
whose
memory
they
had
in
great
veneration
from
such
old
books
and
traditions
they
formed
many
extravagant
expectations
and
among
the
rest
one
was
that
some
time
or
other
a
great
victorious
prince
would
rise
among
them
and
subdue
all
their
enemies
and
make
them
lords
of
the
world
in
augustus
time
they
were
in
a
low
state
reduced
under
the
roman
yoke
and
as
they
never
wanted
a
deliverer
more
so
the
eagerness
of
this
hope
as
it
happens
to
weak
minds
turned
into
a
firm
expectation
that
he
would
soon
come
this
proved
a
temptation
to
some
bold
and
to
some
cunning
men
to
personate
the
prince
so
much
expected
and
nothing
is
more
natural
and
common
to
promote
rebellions
than
to
ground
them
on
new
prophecies
or
new
interpretations
of
old
ones
prophecies
being
suited
to
the
vulgar
superstition
and
operating
with
the
force
of
religion
accordingly
many
such
imposters
rose
pretending
to
be
the
victorious
prince
expected
and
they
and
the
people
who
followed
them
perished
in
the
folly
of
their
attempt
but
jesus
knowing
that
victories
and
triumphs
are
not
things
to
be
counterfeited
that
the
people
were
not
to
be
delivered
from
the
roman
yoke
by
sleight
of
hand
and
having
no
hope
of
being
able
to
cope
with
the
emperor
of
rome
in
good
earnest
took
another
and
more
successful
method
to
carry
on
his
design
he
took
upon
him
to
be
the
prince
foretold
in
the
ancient
prophets
but
then
he
insisted
that
the
true
sense
of
the
prophecies
had
been
mistaken
that
they
related
not
to
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
but
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
that
the
messias
was
not
to
be
a
conquering
prince
but
a
suffering
one
that
he
was
not
to
come
with
horses
of
war
and
chariots
of
war
but
was
to
be
meek
and
lowly
riding
on
an
ass
by
this
means
he
got
the
common
and
necessary
foundation
for
a
new
revelation
which
is
to
be
built
and
founded
on
a
precedent
revelation
to
carry
on
this
design
he
made
choice
of
twelve
men
of
no
fortunes
or
education
and
of
such
understandings
as
gave
no
jealousy
that
they
would
discover
the
plot
and
what
is
most
wonderful
and
shews
their
ability
while
the
master
was
preaching
the
kingdom
of
heaven
these
poor
men
not
weaned
from
the
prejudices
of
their
country
expected
every
day
that
he
would
declare
himself
a
king
and
were
quarreling
who
should
be
his
first
minister
this
expectation
had
a
good
effect
on
the
service
for
it
kept
them
constant
to
their
master
i
must
observe
further
that
the
jews
were
under
strange
apprehensions
of
supernatural
powers
and
as
their
own
religion
was
founded
on
the
belief
of
certain
miracles
said
to
be
wrought
by
their
lawgiver
moses
so
were
they
ever
running
after
wonders
and
miracles
and
ready
to
take
up
with
any
stories
of
this
kind
now
as
something
extraordinary
was
necessary
to
support
the
pretensions
of
jesus
he
dextrously
laid
hold
of
this
weakness
of
the
people
and
set
up
to
be
a
his
disciples
were
well
qualified
to
receive
this
impression
they
saw
or
thought
they
saw
many
strange
things
and
were
able
to
spread
the
fame
and
report
of
them
abroad
this
conduct
had
the
desired
success
the
whole
country
was
alarmed
and
full
of
the
news
of
a
great
prophet
being
come
among
them
they
were
too
full
of
their
own
imagination
to
attend
to
the
notion
of
a
kingdom
of
heaven
here
was
one
mighty
in
deed
and
in
word
and
they
concluded
that
he
was
the
very
prince
their
nation
expected
accordingly
they
once
attempted
to
set
him
up
for
a
king
and
at
another
time
attended
him
in
triumph
to
jerusalem
this
natural
consequence
opens
the
natural
design
of
the
attempt
if
things
had
gone
on
successfully
to
the
end
it
is
probable
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
would
have
been
changed
into
a
kingdom
of
this
world
the
design
indeed
failed
by
the
impatience
and
of
the
multitude
which
alarmed
not
only
the
chief
of
the
jews
but
the
roman
governor
also
the
case
being
come
to
this
point
and
jesus
seeing
that
he
could
not
escape
being
put
to
death
he
declared
that
the
ancient
prophets
had
foretold
that
the
messias
should
die
upon
a
cross
and
that
he
should
rise
again
on
the
third
day
here
was
the
foundation
for
the
continuing
this
plot
which
otherwise
had
died
with
its
author
this
was
his
legacy
to
his
followers
which
having
been
well
managed
by
them
and
their
successors
has
at
last
produced
a
kingdom
indeed
a
kingdom
of
priests
who
have
governed
the
world
for
many
ages
and
have
been
strong
enough
to
set
kings
and
emperors
at
defiance
but
so
it
happens
the
ancient
prophets
appealed
to
are
still
extant
and
there
being
no
such
prophecies
of
the
death
and
resurrection
of
the
messias
they
are
a
standing
evidence
against
this
story
as
he
expected
so
it
happened
that
he
died
on
a
cross
and
the
prosecuting
of
this
contrivance
was
left
to
the
management
of
his
disciples
and
followers
their
part
is
next
to
be
considered
b
my
lord
since
it
is
your
opinion
that
the
objections
should
be
considered
singly
and
the
gentleman
has
carried
his
scheme
down
to
the
death
of
christ
i
think
he
is
come
to
a
proper
rest
and
that
it
is
agreeable
to
your
intention
that
i
should
be
admitted
to
answer
judge
you
say
right
sir
let
us
hear
what
you
answer
to
this
charge
b
my
lord
i
was
unwilling
to
disturb
the
gentleman
by
breaking
in
upon
his
scheme
otherwise
i
would
have
reminded
him
that
this
court
sits
to
examine
evidence
and
not
to
be
entertained
with
fine
imaginations
you
have
had
a
scheme
laid
before
you
but
not
one
bit
of
evidence
to
support
any
part
of
it
no
not
so
much
as
a
pretence
to
any
evidence
the
gentleman
was
i
remember
very
sorry
that
the
old
books
of
the
jews
were
lost
which
would
as
he
supposes
have
set
forth
all
this
matter
and
i
agree
with
him
that
he
has
much
reason
to
be
sorry
considering
his
great
scarcity
of
proof
and
since
i
have
mentioned
this
that
i
may
not
be
to
return
to
it
again
i
would
ask
the
gentleman
now
how
he
knows
there
ever
were
such
books
and
since
if
ever
there
were
any
they
are
lost
how
he
knows
what
they
contained
i
doubt
i
shall
have
frequent
occasion
to
ask
such
questions
it
would
indeed
be
a
sufficient
answer
to
the
whole
to
repeat
the
several
suppositions
that
have
been
made
and
to
call
for
the
evidence
upon
which
they
stand
this
would
plainly
discover
every
part
of
the
story
to
be
mere
fiction
but
since
the
gentleman
seems
to
have
endeavored
to
bring
under
one
view
the
many
insinuations
which
have
of
late
been
spread
abroad
by
different
hands
and
to
work
the
whole
into
a
consistent
scheme
i
will
if
your
patience
shall
permit
examine
this
plot
and
see
to
whom
the
honour
of
the
contrivance
belongs
the
gentleman
begins
with
expressing
his
amazement
that
the
resurrection
has
been
believed
in
all
ages
of
the
church
if
you
ask
him
why
he
must
answer
because
the
account
of
it
is
a
forgery
for
it
is
no
amazement
to
him
surely
that
a
true
account
should
be
generally
well
received
so
that
this
remark
proceeds
indeed
from
confidence
rather
than
amazement
and
comes
only
to
this
that
he
is
sure
that
there
was
no
resurrection
and
i
am
sure
that
this
is
no
evidence
that
there
was
none
whether
he
is
mistaken
in
his
confidence
or
i
in
mine
the
court
must
judge
the
gentleman
observation
that
the
general
belief
of
the
resurrection
creates
a
presumption
that
it
stands
upon
good
evidence
and
therefore
people
look
no
farther
but
follow
their
fathers
as
their
fathers
did
their
grandfathers
before
them
is
in
great
measure
true
but
it
is
a
truth
nothing
to
his
purpose
he
allows
that
the
resurrection
has
been
believed
in
all
ages
of
the
church
that
is
from
the
very
time
of
the
resurrection
what
then
prevailed
with
those
who
first
received
it
they
certainly
did
not
follow
the
example
of
their
fathers
here
then
is
the
point
how
did
this
fact
gain
credit
in
the
world
at
first
credit
it
has
gained
without
doubt
if
the
multitude
at
present
go
into
this
belief
through
prejudice
example
and
for
company
sake
they
do
in
this
case
no
more
nor
otherwise
than
they
do
in
all
cases
and
it
can
not
be
denied
but
that
truth
may
be
received
through
prejudice
as
it
is
called
without
examining
the
proof
or
merits
of
the
cause
as
well
as
falsehood
what
general
truth
is
there
the
merits
of
which
all
the
world
or
the
one
hundredth
part
has
examined
it
is
smartly
said
somewhere
that
the
priest
only
continues
what
the
nurse
began
but
the
life
of
the
remark
consists
in
the
quaintness
of
the
antithesis
between
the
nurse
and
the
priest
and
owes
its
support
much
more
to
sound
than
to
sense
for
is
it
possible
that
children
should
not
hear
something
of
the
common
and
popular
opinions
of
their
country
whether
these
opinions
be
true
or
false
do
they
not
learn
the
common
maxims
of
reason
this
way
perhaps
every
man
first
learned
from
his
nurse
that
two
and
two
make
four
and
whenever
she
divides
an
apple
among
her
children
she
instills
into
them
this
prejudice
that
the
whole
is
equal
to
its
parts
and
all
the
parts
equal
to
the
whole
and
yet
sir
isaac
newton
shame
on
him
what
work
has
he
made
what
a
building
he
has
erected
upon
the
foundation
of
this
as
to
religion
there
never
was
a
religion
there
never
will
be
one
whether
true
or
false
publickly
owned
in
any
country
but
children
have
heard
and
ever
will
hear
more
or
less
of
it
from
those
who
are
placed
about
them
and
if
this
is
and
ever
must
be
the
case
whether
the
religion
be
true
or
false
is
highly
absurd
to
lay
stress
on
this
observation
when
the
question
is
about
the
truth
of
any
religion
for
the
observation
is
indifferent
to
both
sides
of
the
question
we
are
now
i
think
got
through
the
learning
which
must
forever
it
seems
attend
upon
questions
of
this
nature
and
are
coming
to
the
very
merits
of
the
cause
and
here
the
gentleman
on
the
other
side
thought
proper
to
begin
with
an
account
of
the
people
of
the
jews
the
people
in
whose
country
the
fact
is
laid
and
who
were
originally
and
in
some
respects
principally
concerned
in
its
consequences
they
were
he
says
a
weak
superstitious
people
and
lived
under
certain
pretended
prophecies
and
predictions
that
upon
this
ground
they
had
some
time
before
the
appearance
of
christ
jesus
conceived
great
expectation
of
the
coming
of
a
victorious
prince
who
should
deliver
them
from
the
roman
yoke
and
make
them
all
kings
and
princes
he
goes
on
then
to
observe
how
liable
the
people
were
in
this
state
of
things
to
be
imposed
on
and
led
into
rebellion
by
any
one
who
was
bold
enough
to
take
upon
him
to
personate
the
prince
expected
he
observes
further
that
in
fact
many
such
imposters
did
arise
and
deceived
multitudes
to
their
ruin
and
destruction
i
have
laid
these
things
together
because
i
do
not
intend
to
dispute
these
matters
with
the
gentleman
whether
the
jews
were
a
weak
and
superstitious
people
and
influenced
by
false
prophecies
or
whether
they
had
true
prophecies
among
them
is
not
material
to
the
present
question
it
is
enough
for
the
gentleman
argument
if
i
allow
the
fact
to
be
as
he
has
stated
it
that
they
did
expect
a
victorious
prince
that
they
were
upon
this
account
exposed
to
be
practised
on
by
pretenders
and
in
fact
were
often
so
deluded
this
foundation
being
laid
it
was
natural
to
expect
and
i
believe
your
lordship
and
every
one
present
did
expect
that
the
gentleman
would
go
on
to
shew
that
jesus
laid
hold
of
this
opportunity
struck
in
with
the
opinion
of
the
people
and
professed
himself
to
be
the
prince
who
was
to
work
their
deliverance
but
so
far
it
seems
is
this
from
being
the
case
that
the
charge
upon
jesus
is
that
he
took
the
contrary
part
and
set
up
in
opposition
to
all
the
popular
notions
and
prejudices
of
his
country
that
he
interpreted
the
prophecies
to
another
sense
and
meaning
than
his
countrymen
did
and
by
his
expositions
took
away
all
hopes
of
their
ever
seeing
the
victorious
deliverer
so
much
wanted
and
expected
i
know
not
how
to
bring
the
gentleman
premisses
and
his
conclusion
to
any
agreement
they
seem
to
be
at
a
great
variance
at
present
if
it
be
the
likeliest
method
for
an
imposter
to
succeed
to
build
on
the
popular
opinions
prejudices
and
prophecies
of
the
people
then
surely
an
imposter
can
not
possibly
take
a
worse
method
than
to
set
up
in
opposition
to
all
the
prejudices
and
prophecies
of
the
country
where
was
the
art
and
cunning
then
of
taking
this
method
could
anything
be
expected
from
it
but
hatred
contempt
and
persecution
and
did
christ
in
fact
meet
with
any
other
treatment
from
the
jews
and
yet
when
he
found
as
the
gentleman
allows
he
did
that
he
must
perish
in
this
attempt
did
he
change
his
note
did
he
come
about
and
drop
any
intimations
agreeable
to
the
notions
of
the
people
it
is
not
pretended
this
which
in
any
other
case
which
ever
happened
would
be
taken
to
be
a
plain
mark
of
great
honesty
or
great
stupidity
or
of
both
is
in
the
present
case
art
policy
and
contrivance
but
it
seems
jesus
dared
not
set
up
to
be
the
victorious
prince
expected
for
victories
are
not
to
be
counterfeited
i
hope
it
was
no
crime
in
him
that
he
did
not
assume
this
false
character
and
try
to
abuse
the
credibility
of
the
people
if
he
had
done
so
it
certainly
would
have
been
a
crime
and
therefore
in
this
point
at
least
he
is
innocent
i
do
not
suppose
the
gentleman
imagines
the
jews
were
well
founded
in
their
expectation
of
a
temporal
prince
and
therefore
when
christ
opposed
this
conceit
at
the
manifest
hazard
of
his
life
as
he
certainly
had
truth
on
his
side
so
the
presumption
is
that
it
was
for
the
sake
of
truth
that
he
exposed
himself
no
he
wanted
we
are
told
the
common
and
necessary
foundation
for
a
new
revelation
the
authority
of
an
old
one
to
build
on
very
well
i
will
not
inquire
how
common
or
how
necessary
this
foundation
is
to
a
new
revelation
for
be
that
case
as
it
will
it
is
evident
that
in
the
method
christ
took
he
had
not
nor
could
have
the
supposed
advantage
of
such
foundation
for
why
is
this
foundation
necessary
a
friend
of
the
gentleman
shall
tell
you
because
it
must
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
introduce
among
men
who
in
all
civilized
countries
are
bred
up
in
the
belief
of
some
revealed
religion
a
revealed
religion
wholly
new
or
such
as
has
no
reference
to
a
preceding
one
for
that
would
be
to
combat
all
men
on
too
many
respects
and
not
to
proceed
on
a
sufficient
number
of
principles
necessary
to
be
assented
to
by
those
on
whom
the
first
impressions
of
a
new
religion
are
proposed
to
be
made
you
see
now
the
reason
of
the
necessity
of
this
foundation
it
is
that
the
new
teacher
may
have
the
advantage
of
old
popular
opinions
and
fix
himself
upon
the
prejudices
of
the
people
had
christ
any
such
advantages
or
did
he
seek
any
such
the
people
expected
a
victorious
prince
he
told
them
they
were
mistaken
they
held
as
sacred
the
traditions
of
the
elders
he
told
them
those
traditions
made
the
law
of
god
of
none
effect
they
valued
themselves
for
being
the
peculiar
people
of
god
he
told
them
that
people
from
all
quarters
of
the
world
should
be
the
people
of
god
and
sit
down
with
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
in
the
kingdom
they
thought
god
could
be
worshipped
only
at
jerusalem
he
told
them
god
might
and
should
be
worshipped
everywhere
they
were
superstitious
in
the
observance
of
the
sabbath
he
according
to
their
reckoning
broke
it
frequently
in
a
word
their
washings
of
hands
and
pots
their
superstitious
distinctions
of
meats
their
prayers
in
publick
their
villanies
in
secret
were
all
reproved
exposed
and
condemned
by
him
and
the
cry
ran
strongly
against
him
that
he
came
to
destroy
the
law
and
the
prophets
and
now
sir
what
advantage
did
christ
have
of
your
common
and
necessary
foundation
what
sufficient
number
of
principles
owned
by
the
people
did
he
build
on
if
he
adhered
to
the
old
revelation
in
the
true
sense
or
which
is
sufficient
to
the
present
argument
in
a
sense
not
received
by
the
people
it
was
in
truth
the
greatest
difficulty
he
had
to
struggle
with
and
therefore
what
could
tempt
him
but
purely
a
regard
for
truth
to
take
upon
himself
so
many
difficulties
which
might
have
been
avoided
could
he
have
been
but
silent
as
to
the
old
revelation
and
left
the
people
to
their
imaginations
to
carry
on
this
plot
we
are
told
that
the
next
thing
which
jesus
did
was
to
make
choice
of
proper
persons
to
be
his
disciples
the
gentleman
has
given
us
their
character
but
as
i
suppose
he
has
more
employment
for
them
before
he
has
done
i
desire
to
defer
the
consideration
of
their
abilities
and
conduct
till
i
hear
what
work
he
has
for
them
to
do
i
would
only
observe
that
thus
far
this
plot
differs
from
all
that
ever
i
heard
of
imposters
generally
take
advantage
of
the
prejudices
of
the
people
generally
too
they
make
choice
of
cunning
dextrous
fellows
to
manage
under
them
but
in
this
case
jesus
opposed
all
the
notions
of
the
people
and
made
choice
of
simpletons
it
seems
to
conduct
his
contrivances
but
what
design
what
real
end
was
carrying
on
all
this
while
why
the
gentleman
tells
us
that
the
very
thing
disclaimed
the
temporal
kingdom
was
the
real
thing
aimed
at
under
this
disguise
he
told
the
people
there
was
no
foundation
to
expect
a
temporal
deliverer
warned
them
against
all
who
would
set
up
those
pretensions
he
declared
there
was
no
ground
from
the
ancient
prophecies
to
expect
such
a
prince
and
yet
by
these
very
means
he
was
working
his
way
to
an
opportunity
of
declaring
himself
to
be
the
very
prince
the
people
wanted
we
are
still
upon
the
marvelous
every
step
opens
new
wonders
i
blame
not
the
gentleman
for
what
but
this
can
be
imagined
to
give
any
account
of
these
measures
imputed
to
christ
be
this
never
so
unlikely
yet
this
is
the
only
thing
that
can
be
said
had
christ
been
charged
with
enthusiasm
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
to
assign
a
reason
for
his
conduct
madness
is
unaccountable
ratione
modoque
tractari
non
vult
but
when
design
cunning
and
fraud
are
made
the
charge
and
carried
to
such
an
height
as
to
suppose
him
to
be
a
party
to
the
contrivance
of
a
sham
resurrection
for
himself
it
is
necessary
to
say
to
what
end
this
cunning
tended
it
was
we
are
told
to
a
kingdom
and
indeed
the
temptation
was
little
enough
considering
that
the
chief
conductor
of
the
plot
was
crucified
for
his
pains
but
were
the
means
made
use
of
at
all
probable
to
achieve
the
end
yes
says
the
gentleman
that
ca
be
disputed
for
they
had
really
this
effect
the
people
would
have
made
him
king
very
well
why
was
he
not
king
then
why
it
happened
unluckily
that
he
would
not
accept
the
offer
but
withdrew
himself
from
the
multitude
and
lay
concealed
until
they
were
dispersed
it
will
be
said
perhaps
that
jesus
was
a
better
judge
of
affairs
than
the
people
and
saw
that
it
was
not
yet
time
to
accept
the
offer
be
it
so
let
us
see
then
what
follows
the
government
was
alarmed
and
jesus
was
looked
on
as
a
person
dangerous
to
the
state
and
he
had
discernment
enough
to
see
that
his
death
was
determined
and
inevitable
what
does
he
do
then
why
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
case
and
to
save
the
benefit
of
his
undertaking
to
those
who
were
to
succeed
him
he
pretends
to
prophecy
of
his
death
which
he
knew
could
not
be
avoided
men
do
not
use
to
play
tricks
in
articulo
mortis
but
this
plot
had
nothing
common
nothing
in
the
ordinary
way
but
what
if
it
should
appear
that
after
the
foretelling
of
his
death
through
despair
of
his
fortunes
it
is
said
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
set
up
for
king
once
more
and
once
more
refused
the
opportunity
men
in
despair
lay
hold
on
the
least
help
and
never
refuse
the
greatest
now
the
case
was
really
so
after
he
had
foretold
his
crucifixion
he
came
to
jerusalem
in
the
triumphant
manner
the
gentleman
mentioned
the
people
strewed
his
way
with
boughs
and
flowers
and
were
all
at
his
devotion
the
jewish
governors
lay
still
for
fear
of
the
people
why
was
not
this
opportunity
laid
hold
on
to
seize
the
kingdom
or
at
least
to
secure
himself
from
the
ignominious
death
he
expected
for
whose
sake
was
he
contented
to
die
for
whose
sake
did
he
contrive
this
plot
of
his
resurrection
wife
and
children
he
had
none
his
nearest
relations
gave
little
credit
to
him
his
disciples
were
not
fit
even
to
be
trusted
with
the
secret
nor
capable
to
manage
any
advantage
that
could
arise
from
it
however
the
gentleman
tells
us
a
kingdom
has
arisen
out
of
this
plot
a
kingdom
of
priests
but
when
did
it
arise
some
hundred
years
after
the
death
of
christ
in
opposition
to
his
will
and
almost
to
the
subversion
of
his
religion
and
yet
we
are
told
this
kingdom
was
the
thing
he
had
in
view
i
am
apt
to
think
the
gentleman
is
persuaded
that
the
dominion
he
complains
of
is
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
gospel
i
am
sure
some
of
his
friends
have
taken
great
pains
to
prove
it
is
so
how
then
can
it
be
charged
as
the
intention
of
the
gospel
to
introduce
it
whatever
the
case
was
it
can
not
surely
be
suspected
that
christ
died
to
make
popes
and
cardinals
the
alterations
which
have
happened
in
the
doctrines
and
practices
of
churches
since
the
christian
religion
was
settled
by
those
who
had
an
authentick
commission
to
settle
it
are
quite
out
of
the
question
when
the
inquiry
is
about
the
truth
of
the
christian
religion
christ
and
his
apostles
did
not
vouch
for
the
truth
of
all
that
should
be
taught
in
the
church
in
future
times
nay
they
foretold
and
fore
warned
the
world
against
such
corrupt
teachers
it
is
therefore
absurd
to
challenge
the
religion
of
christ
because
of
the
corruptions
which
have
spread
among
christians
the
gospel
has
no
more
concern
with
them
and
ought
no
more
to
be
charged
with
them
than
with
the
doctrines
of
the
alcoran
there
is
but
one
observation
more
i
think
which
the
gentleman
made
under
this
head
jesus
he
says
referred
to
the
authority
of
ancient
prophecies
to
prove
that
the
messias
was
to
die
and
rise
again
the
ancient
books
referred
to
are
extant
and
no
such
prophecies
he
says
are
to
be
found
now
whether
the
gentleman
can
find
these
prophecies
or
no
is
not
material
to
the
present
question
it
is
allowed
that
christ
foretold
his
own
death
and
resurrection
if
the
resurrection
was
managed
by
fraud
christ
was
certainly
in
the
fraud
himself
by
foretelling
the
fraud
which
was
to
happen
disprove
therefore
the
resurrection
and
we
shall
have
no
further
occasion
for
prophecy
on
the
other
side
by
foretelling
the
resurrection
he
certainly
put
the
proof
of
his
mission
on
the
truth
of
the
event
whether
it
be
the
character
of
the
messias
in
the
ancient
prophets
or
no
that
he
should
die
and
rise
again
without
doubt
jesus
is
not
the
messias
if
he
did
not
rise
again
for
by
his
own
prophecy
he
made
it
part
of
the
character
of
the
messias
if
the
event
justified
the
prediction
it
is
such
an
evidence
as
no
man
of
sense
and
reason
can
reject
one
would
naturally
think
that
the
foretelling
his
resurrection
and
giving
such
publick
notice
to
expect
it
that
his
keenest
enemies
were
fully
apprised
of
it
carried
with
it
the
greatest
mark
of
sincere
dealing
it
stands
thus
far
clear
of
the
suspicion
of
fraud
and
had
it
proceeded
from
enthusiasm
and
an
heated
imagination
the
dead
body
at
least
would
have
rested
in
the
grave
and
without
further
evidence
have
confuted
such
pretensions
and
since
the
dead
body
was
not
only
carried
openly
to
the
grave
but
there
watched
and
guarded
and
yet
could
never
afterwards
be
found
never
heard
of
more
as
a
dead
body
there
must
of
necessity
have
been
either
a
real
miracle
or
a
great
fraud
in
this
case
enthusiasm
dies
with
the
man
and
has
no
operation
on
his
dead
body
there
is
therefore
here
no
medium
you
must
either
admit
the
miracle
or
prove
the
fraud
judge
a
you
are
at
liberty
either
to
reply
to
what
has
been
said
under
this
head
or
to
go
on
with
your
cause
a
my
lord
the
observations
i
laid
before
you
were
but
introductory
to
the
main
evidences
on
which
the
merits
of
the
cause
must
rest
the
gentleman
concluded
that
here
must
be
a
real
miracle
or
a
great
fraud
a
fraud
he
means
to
which
jesus
in
his
lifetime
was
a
party
there
is
he
says
no
medium
i
beg
his
pardon
why
might
it
not
be
an
enthusiasm
in
the
master
which
occasioned
the
prediction
and
fraud
in
the
servants
who
put
it
in
execution
b
my
lord
this
is
new
matter
and
not
a
reply
the
gentleman
opened
this
transaction
as
a
fraud
from
one
end
to
the
other
now
he
supposes
christ
to
have
been
an
honest
poor
enthusiast
and
the
disciples
only
to
be
cheats
judge
sir
if
you
go
to
new
matter
the
council
on
the
other
side
must
be
admitted
to
answer
a
my
lord
i
have
no
such
intention
i
was
observing
that
the
account
i
gave
of
jesus
was
only
to
introduce
the
evidence
that
is
to
be
laid
before
the
court
it
can
not
be
expected
that
i
should
know
all
the
secret
designs
of
this
contrivance
especially
considering
that
we
have
but
short
accounts
of
this
affair
and
those
too
conveyed
through
hands
of
friends
and
parties
to
the
plot
in
such
a
case
it
is
enough
if
we
can
imagine
what
the
views
probably
were
and
in
such
case
too
it
must
be
very
easy
for
a
gentleman
of
parts
to
raise
contrary
imaginations
and
to
argue
plausibly
from
them
but
the
gentleman
has
rightly
observed
that
if
the
resurrection
be
a
fraud
there
is
an
end
to
all
pretensions
good
or
bad
that
were
to
be
supported
by
it
therefore
i
shall
go
on
to
prove
this
fraud
which
is
one
main
part
of
the
cause
now
to
be
determined
i
beg
leave
to
remind
you
that
jesus
in
his
lifetime
foretold
his
death
and
that
he
should
rise
again
the
third
day
the
first
part
of
his
prediction
was
accomplished
he
died
on
the
cross
and
was
buried
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
the
particulars
of
his
crucifixion
death
and
burial
it
is
a
well
known
story
b
my
lord
i
desire
to
know
whether
the
gentleman
charges
any
fraud
upon
this
part
of
the
history
perhaps
he
may
be
of
the
opinion
by
and
by
that
there
was
a
sleight
of
hand
in
the
crucifixion
and
that
christ
only
counterfeited
death
a
no
no
have
no
such
fears
he
was
not
crucified
by
his
disciples
but
by
the
romans
and
the
jews
and
they
were
in
very
good
earnest
i
will
prove
beyond
contradiction
that
the
dead
body
was
fairly
laid
in
the
tomb
and
it
will
be
well
for
you
if
you
can
get
it
as
fairly
out
again
judge
go
on
with
your
evidence
a
my
lord
the
crucifixion
being
over
the
dead
body
was
conveyed
to
a
sepulchre
and
in
the
general
opinion
there
seemed
to
be
an
end
of
the
whole
design
but
the
governors
of
the
jews
watchful
for
the
safety
of
the
people
called
to
mind
that
jesus
in
his
lifetime
had
said
that
he
would
rise
again
on
the
third
day
it
may
at
first
sight
seem
strange
that
they
should
give
any
attention
to
such
a
prophecy
a
prophecy
big
with
confidence
and
presumption
and
which
to
the
common
sense
of
mankind
carried
its
confutation
along
with
it
and
there
is
no
other
nation
in
the
world
which
would
not
have
slighted
such
a
vain
prognostication
of
a
known
imposter
but
they
had
warning
to
be
watchful
it
was
not
long
before
that
the
people
had
like
to
have
been
fatally
deluded
and
imposed
on
by
him
in
the
pretended
resuscitation
of
lazarus
they
had
fully
discovered
the
cheat
in
the
case
of
lazarus
and
had
narrowly
escaped
the
dangerous
consequences
of
it
and
though
jesus
was
dead
yet
he
had
many
disciples
and
followers
alive
who
were
ready
enough
to
combine
in
any
fraud
to
verify
the
prediction
of
their
master
should
they
succeed
the
rulers
foresaw
the
consequences
in
this
case
would
be
more
fatal
than
those
which
before
they
had
narrowly
escaped
upon
this
account
they
addressed
themselves
to
the
roman
governor
told
him
how
the
case
was
and
desired
that
he
would
grant
them
a
guard
to
watch
the
sepulchre
that
the
service
would
not
be
long
for
the
prediction
limited
the
resurrection
to
the
third
day
and
when
that
was
over
the
soldiers
might
be
released
from
the
duty
pilate
granted
the
request
and
a
guard
was
set
to
watch
the
sepulchre
this
was
not
all
the
chief
priests
took
another
method
to
prevent
all
frauds
and
it
was
the
best
that
could
possibly
be
taken
which
was
to
seal
up
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
to
understand
to
what
purpose
this
caution
was
used
you
need
only
consider
what
is
intended
by
sealing
up
doors
and
boxes
or
writings
is
it
not
for
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
concerned
that
they
may
be
sure
things
are
in
the
state
they
left
them
when
they
come
and
find
their
seals
not
injured
this
was
the
method
used
by
darius
when
daniel
was
cast
into
the
lions
den
he
sealed
the
door
of
the
den
and
for
what
purpose
was
it
not
to
satisfy
himself
and
his
court
that
no
art
had
been
used
to
preserve
daniel
and
when
he
came
and
saw
daniel
safe
and
his
seal
untouched
he
was
satisfied
and
indeed
if
we
consider
the
thing
rightly
a
seal
thus
used
imports
a
covenant
if
you
deliver
writings
to
a
person
sealed
and
he
accepts
them
so
your
delivery
and
his
acceptance
implies
a
covenant
between
you
that
the
writings
shall
be
delivered
and
the
seal
whole
and
should
the
seal
be
broken
it
would
be
a
manifest
fraud
and
breach
of
trust
nay
so
strongly
is
this
covenant
implied
that
there
needs
no
special
agreement
in
the
case
it
is
a
compact
which
men
are
put
under
by
the
law
of
nations
and
the
common
consent
of
mankind
when
you
send
a
letter
sealed
to
the
house
you
have
not
indeed
a
special
agreement
with
all
persons
through
whose
hands
it
passes
that
it
shall
not
be
opened
by
any
hand
but
his
only
to
whom
it
is
directed
yet
men
know
themselves
to
be
under
this
restraint
and
that
it
is
unlawful
and
dishonorable
to
transgress
it
since
then
the
sepulchre
was
sealed
since
the
seal
imported
a
covenant
consider
who
were
the
parties
to
this
covenant
they
could
be
no
other
than
the
chief
priests
on
one
side
and
the
apostles
on
the
other
to
prove
this
no
special
agreement
need
be
shewn
on
one
side
there
was
a
concern
to
see
the
prophecy
fulfilled
on
the
other
to
prevent
fraud
in
fulfilling
it
the
sum
of
their
agreement
was
naturally
this
that
the
seals
should
be
opened
at
the
time
appointed
for
the
resurrection
that
all
parties
might
see
and
be
satisfied
whether
the
dead
body
was
come
to
life
or
no
what
now
would
any
reasonable
man
expect
from
these
circumstances
do
you
expect
to
hear
that
the
chief
priests
and
the
apostles
met
at
the
time
appointed
opened
the
seals
and
that
the
matter
in
dispute
was
settled
beyond
all
controversy
one
way
or
other
but
see
how
it
happened
the
seals
were
broken
the
body
stolen
away
in
the
night
by
the
disciples
none
of
the
chief
priests
present
or
summoned
to
see
the
seals
opened
the
guards
when
examined
were
forced
to
confess
the
truth
though
joined
with
an
acknowledgement
of
their
guilt
which
made
them
liable
to
be
punished
by
pilate
they
confessed
that
they
were
asleep
and
in
the
mean
time
that
the
body
was
stolen
away
by
the
disciples
this
evidence
of
the
roman
soldiers
and
the
far
stronger
evidence
arising
from
the
clandestine
method
of
breaking
up
the
seals
are
sufficient
proofs
of
fraud
but
there
is
another
circumstance
in
the
case
of
equal
weight
though
the
seals
did
not
prevent
the
cheat
entirely
yet
they
effectually
falsified
the
prediction
according
to
the
prediction
jesus
was
to
rise
on
the
third
day
or
after
the
third
day
at
this
time
the
chief
priests
intended
to
be
present
and
probably
would
have
been
attended
by
a
great
multitude
this
made
it
impossible
to
play
any
tricks
at
that
time
and
therefore
the
apostles
were
forced
the
hasten
the
plot
and
accordingly
the
resurrection
happened
a
day
before
its
time
for
the
body
was
buried
on
the
friday
and
was
gone
early
in
the
morning
on
sunday
these
are
plain
facts
facts
drawn
from
the
accounts
given
to
us
by
those
who
are
friends
to
the
belief
of
the
resurrection
the
gentleman
wo
call
these
imaginations
or
complain
that
i
have
given
him
schemes
instead
of
evidence
b
my
lord
i
am
now
to
consider
that
part
of
the
argument
upon
which
the
gentleman
lays
the
greatest
stress
he
has
given
us
his
evidence
mere
evidence
he
says
unmixed
and
clear
of
all
schemes
and
imaginations
in
one
thing
indeed
he
has
been
as
good
as
his
word
he
has
proved
beyond
contradiction
that
christ
died
and
was
laid
in
the
sepulchre
for
without
doubt
when
the
jews
sealed
the
stone
they
took
care
to
see
that
the
body
was
there
otherwise
their
precaution
was
useless
he
has
proved
too
that
the
prediction
of
christ
concerning
his
own
resurrection
was
a
thing
publickly
known
in
all
jerusalem
for
he
owns
that
this
gave
occasion
for
all
the
care
that
was
taken
to
prevent
fraud
if
this
open
prediction
implies
a
fraudulent
design
the
evidence
is
strong
with
the
gentleman
but
if
it
shall
appear
to
be
what
it
really
was
the
greatest
mark
that
could
be
given
of
sincerity
and
plain
dealing
in
the
whole
affair
the
evidence
will
still
be
as
strong
but
the
weight
of
it
will
fall
on
the
wrong
side
for
the
gentleman
purpose
in
the
next
place
the
gentleman
seems
to
be
at
a
great
loss
to
account
for
the
credit
which
the
chief
priests
gave
to
the
prediction
of
the
resurrection
by
the
care
they
took
to
prevent
it
he
thinks
the
thing
in
itself
was
too
extravagant
and
absurd
to
deserve
any
regard
and
that
no
one
would
have
regarded
such
a
prediction
in
any
other
time
or
place
i
agree
with
the
gentleman
entirely
but
then
i
demand
of
him
a
reason
why
the
chief
priests
were
under
any
concern
about
this
prediction
was
it
because
they
had
plainly
discovered
him
to
be
a
cheat
and
an
imposter
it
is
impossible
this
reason
would
have
convinced
them
of
the
folly
and
presumption
of
the
prediction
it
must
therefore
necessarily
be
that
they
had
discovered
something
in
the
life
and
actions
of
christ
which
raised
this
jealousy
and
made
them
listen
to
a
prophecy
in
his
case
which
in
any
other
case
they
would
have
despised
and
what
could
this
be
but
the
secret
conviction
they
were
under
by
his
many
miracles
of
his
extraordinary
powers
this
care
therefore
of
the
chief
priests
over
his
dead
helpless
body
is
a
lasting
testimony
of
the
mighty
works
which
jesus
did
in
his
lifetime
for
had
the
jews
been
persuaded
that
he
performed
no
wonders
in
his
life
i
think
they
would
not
have
been
afraid
of
seeing
any
done
by
him
after
his
death
but
the
gentleman
is
of
another
mind
he
says
they
had
discovered
a
plain
cheat
in
the
case
of
lazarus
whom
christ
had
pretended
to
raise
from
the
dead
and
therefore
they
took
all
this
care
to
guard
against
a
like
cheat
i
begin
now
to
want
evidence
i
am
forbid
to
call
this
imagination
what
else
to
call
it
i
know
not
there
is
not
the
least
intimation
given
from
history
that
there
was
any
cheat
in
the
case
of
lazarus
or
that
any
one
suspected
a
cheat
lazarus
lived
in
the
country
after
he
was
raised
from
the
dead
and
though
his
life
was
secretly
and
basely
sought
after
yet
no
body
had
the
courage
to
call
to
a
trial
for
his
part
in
the
cheat
it
may
be
said
perhaps
the
rulers
were
terrified
very
well
but
they
were
not
terrified
when
they
had
christ
in
their
possession
when
they
brought
him
to
a
trial
why
did
they
not
then
object
this
cheat
to
christ
it
would
have
been
much
to
their
purpose
instead
of
that
they
accuse
him
of
a
design
to
pull
down
their
temple
to
destroy
their
law
and
of
blasphemy
but
not
one
word
of
any
fraud
in
the
case
of
lazarus
or
any
other
case
but
not
to
enter
into
the
merits
of
this
cause
which
has
in
it
too
many
circumstances
for
your
present
consideration
let
us
take
the
case
to
be
as
the
gentleman
states
it
that
the
cheat
in
the
case
of
lazarus
was
detected
what
consequence
is
to
be
expected
in
all
other
cases
impostors
once
discovered
grow
odious
and
contemptible
and
quite
incapable
of
doing
further
mischief
so
little
are
they
regarded
that
even
when
they
tell
the
truth
they
are
neglected
was
it
so
in
this
case
no
says
the
gentleman
the
jews
were
the
more
careful
that
christ
should
not
cheat
them
in
his
own
resurrection
surely
this
is
a
most
singular
case
when
the
people
thought
him
a
prophet
the
chief
priests
sought
to
kill
him
and
thought
his
death
would
put
an
end
to
his
pretensions
when
they
and
the
people
had
discovered
him
to
be
a
cheat
then
they
thought
him
not
safe
even
when
he
was
dead
but
were
afraid
he
should
prove
a
true
prophet
and
according
to
his
own
prediction
rise
again
a
needless
a
preposterous
fear
in
the
next
place
the
gentleman
tells
us
how
proper
the
care
was
that
the
chief
priests
took
i
agree
perfectly
with
him
human
policy
could
not
invent
a
more
proper
method
to
guard
against
and
prevent
all
fraud
they
delivered
the
sepulchre
with
the
dead
body
in
it
to
a
company
of
roman
soldiers
who
had
orders
from
their
officer
to
watch
the
sepulchre
their
care
went
further
still
they
sealed
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
upon
this
occasion
the
gentleman
has
explained
the
use
of
seals
when
applied
to
such
purposes
they
imply
he
says
a
covenant
that
the
things
sealed
up
shall
remain
in
the
condition
they
are
till
the
parties
to
the
sealing
agree
to
open
them
i
see
no
reason
to
enter
into
the
learning
about
seals
let
it
be
as
the
gentleman
has
opened
it
what
then
why
then
it
seems
the
apostles
and
chief
priests
were
in
a
covenant
that
there
should
be
no
resurrection
at
least
no
opening
of
the
door
till
they
met
together
at
an
appointed
time
to
view
and
unseal
the
door
your
lordship
and
the
court
will
now
consider
the
probability
of
this
supposition
when
christ
was
seized
and
carried
to
his
trial
his
disciples
fled
out
of
a
just
apprehension
that
they
should
if
apprehended
be
sacrificed
with
their
master
peter
indeed
followed
him
but
his
courage
soon
failed
and
it
is
well
known
in
what
manner
he
denied
him
after
the
death
of
christ
his
disciples
were
so
far
from
being
ready
to
engage
for
his
resurrection
or
to
enter
into
terms
and
agreements
for
the
manner
in
which
it
should
be
done
that
they
themselves
did
not
believe
it
ever
would
be
they
gave
over
all
hopes
and
thoughts
of
it
and
far
from
entering
into
engagements
with
the
chief
priests
their
whole
concern
was
to
keep
themselves
concealed
from
them
this
is
a
well
known
case
and
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
particular
authorities
to
prove
this
truth
can
any
man
now
in
his
right
senses
think
that
the
disciples
under
these
circumstances
entered
into
this
covenant
with
the
jews
i
believe
the
gentleman
do
think
it
and
for
that
reason
says
that
seals
so
used
import
a
covenant
without
a
special
agreement
be
it
so
and
it
must
then
be
allowed
that
the
apostles
were
no
more
concerned
in
these
seals
than
every
other
man
in
the
country
and
no
more
answerable
for
them
for
the
covenant
reached
to
every
body
as
well
as
to
them
since
they
were
under
no
special
contract
but
i
beg
pardon
for
spending
your
time
unnecessarily
when
the
simple
plain
account
of
this
matter
will
best
answer
all
these
jealousies
and
suspicions
the
jews
it
is
plain
were
exceedingly
solicitous
about
this
event
for
this
reason
they
obtained
a
guard
from
pilate
and
when
they
had
they
were
still
suspicious
lest
their
guards
should
deceive
them
and
enter
into
combination
against
them
to
secure
this
point
they
sealed
the
door
and
required
of
the
guards
to
deliver
up
the
sepulchre
to
them
sealed
as
it
was
this
is
the
natural
and
true
account
of
the
matter
do
but
consider
it
in
a
parallel
case
suppose
a
prince
should
set
a
guard
at
the
door
of
his
treasury
and
the
officer
who
placed
the
guard
should
seal
the
door
and
say
to
the
soldiers
you
shall
be
answerable
for
the
seal
if
i
find
it
broken
would
not
all
the
world
understand
the
seal
to
be
fixed
to
guard
against
the
soldiers
who
might
though
employed
to
keep
off
others
be
ready
enough
to
pilfer
themselves
this
is
in
all
such
cases
but
a
necessary
care
you
may
place
guards
and
when
you
do
all
is
in
their
power
et
quis
custodes
custodiat
ipsos
but
it
seems
that
notwithstanding
all
this
care
the
seals
were
broken
and
the
body
gone
if
you
complain
of
this
sir
demand
satisfaction
of
your
guards
they
only
are
responsible
for
it
the
disciples
had
no
more
to
do
in
it
than
you
or
i
the
guards
the
gentleman
says
have
confessed
the
truth
and
owned
that
they
were
asleep
and
that
the
disciples
in
the
mean
time
stole
away
the
body
i
wish
the
guards
were
in
court
i
would
ask
them
how
they
came
to
be
so
punctual
in
relating
what
happened
when
they
were
asleep
what
induced
them
to
believe
that
the
body
was
stolen
at
all
what
that
it
was
stolen
by
the
disciples
since
by
their
own
confession
they
were
asleep
and
say
nothing
saw
no
body
but
since
they
are
not
to
be
had
i
would
desire
to
ask
the
gentleman
the
same
questions
and
whether
he
has
any
authorities
in
point
to
shew
that
ever
any
man
was
admitted
as
an
evidence
in
any
court
to
prove
a
fact
which
happened
when
he
was
asleep
i
see
the
gentleman
is
uneasy
i
press
the
matter
no
further
as
this
story
has
no
evidence
to
support
it
so
neither
has
it
any
probability
the
gentleman
has
given
you
the
character
of
the
disciples
that
they
were
weak
ignorant
men
full
of
the
popular
prejudices
and
superstitions
of
their
country
which
stuck
close
to
them
notwithstanding
their
long
acquaintance
with
their
master
the
apostles
are
not
much
wronged
in
this
account
and
is
it
likely
that
such
men
should
engage
in
so
desperate
design
as
to
steal
away
the
body
in
opposition
to
the
combined
power
of
the
jews
and
romans
what
could
tempt
them
to
it
what
good
could
the
dead
body
do
them
or
if
it
could
have
done
them
any
what
hope
had
they
to
succeed
in
their
attempt
a
dead
body
is
not
to
be
removed
by
sleight
of
hand
it
requires
many
hands
to
move
it
besides
the
great
stone
at
the
mouth
of
the
sepulchre
was
to
be
removed
which
could
not
be
done
silently
or
by
men
walking
on
to
prevent
discovery
so
that
if
the
guards
had
really
been
asleep
yet
there
was
no
encouragement
to
go
on
this
enterprise
for
it
is
hardly
possible
to
suppose
but
that
rolling
away
the
stone
moving
the
body
the
hurry
and
confusion
of
carrying
it
off
must
awaken
them
but
supposing
the
thing
was
practicable
yet
the
attempt
was
such
as
the
disciples
consistently
with
their
own
notions
could
not
undertake
the
gentleman
says
they
continued
all
their
lifetime
to
expect
to
see
him
a
temporal
prince
and
a
friend
of
the
gentleman
has
observed
what
is
equally
true
that
they
had
the
same
expectation
after
his
death
consider
now
their
case
their
master
was
dead
and
they
are
to
contrive
to
steal
away
his
body
for
what
did
they
expect
to
make
a
king
of
the
dead
body
if
they
could
get
it
into
their
power
or
did
they
think
if
they
had
it
they
could
raise
it
to
life
again
if
they
trusted
so
far
to
their
master
prediction
as
to
expect
his
resurrection
which
i
think
is
evident
they
did
not
could
they
yet
think
the
resurrection
depended
on
their
having
the
dead
body
it
is
in
all
views
absurd
but
the
gentleman
supposes
that
they
meant
to
carry
on
the
design
for
themselves
in
the
master
if
they
could
but
have
persuaded
the
people
to
believe
him
risen
from
the
dead
but
he
does
not
consider
that
by
this
supposition
he
strips
the
disciples
of
every
part
of
their
character
at
once
and
presents
to
us
a
new
set
of
men
in
every
respect
different
from
the
former
the
former
disciples
were
weak
plain
men
but
these
are
bold
hardy
cunning
and
contriving
the
former
were
full
of
the
superstitions
of
their
country
and
expected
a
prince
from
the
authority
of
their
prophets
but
these
were
despisers
of
the
prophets
and
of
the
notions
of
their
countrymen
and
are
designing
to
turn
these
fables
to
their
own
advantage
for
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
they
believed
the
prophets
and
at
the
same
time
thought
to
accomplish
or
defeat
them
by
so
manifest
a
cheat
to
which
they
themselves
at
least
were
conscious
but
let
us
take
leave
of
these
suppositions
and
see
how
the
true
evidence
is
this
case
stands
guards
were
placed
and
they
did
their
duty
but
what
are
guards
and
sentinels
against
the
power
of
god
an
angel
of
the
lord
opened
the
sepulchre
the
guards
saw
him
and
became
like
dead
men
this
account
they
gave
to
the
chief
priests
who
still
persisting
in
their
obstinacy
bribed
the
guards
to
tell
the
contradictory
story
of
their
being
asleep
and
the
body
stolen
i
can
not
but
observe
to
your
lordship
that
all
these
circumstances
so
much
questioned
and
suspected
were
necessary
circumstances
supposing
the
resurrection
to
be
true
the
seal
was
broken
the
body
came
out
of
the
sepulchre
the
guards
were
placed
in
vain
to
prevent
it
be
it
so
i
desire
to
know
whether
the
gentleman
thinks
that
the
seal
put
god
under
covenant
or
could
prescribe
to
him
a
method
for
performing
this
great
work
or
whether
he
thinks
the
guards
were
placed
to
maintain
the
seal
in
opposition
to
the
power
of
god
if
he
will
maintain
neither
of
these
points
then
the
opening
of
the
seals
notwithstanding
the
guard
set
upon
them
will
be
an
evidence
not
of
the
fraud
but
of
the
power
of
the
resurrection
and
the
guards
will
have
nothing
to
answer
for
but
only
this
that
they
were
not
stronger
than
god
the
seal
was
a
proper
check
upon
the
guards
the
jews
had
no
other
meaning
in
it
they
could
not
be
so
stupid
as
to
imagine
that
they
could
by
this
contrivance
disappoint
the
designs
of
providence
and
it
is
surprising
to
hear
these
circumstances
made
use
of
to
prove
the
resurrection
to
be
a
fraud
which
yet
could
not
but
happen
supposing
the
resurrection
to
be
true
but
there
is
another
circumstance
still
which
the
gentleman
reckons
very
material
and
upon
which
i
find
great
stress
is
laid
the
resurrection
happened
we
are
told
a
day
sooner
than
the
prediction
imported
the
reason
assigned
for
it
is
that
the
execution
of
the
plot
at
the
time
appointed
was
rendered
impracticable
because
the
chief
priests
an
probably
great
numbers
of
the
people
were
prepared
to
visit
the
sepulchre
at
that
time
and
therefore
the
disciples
were
under
a
necessity
of
hastening
their
plot
this
observation
is
entirely
inconsistent
with
the
supposition
upon
which
the
reasoning
stands
the
gentleman
has
all
along
supposed
the
resurrection
to
have
been
managed
by
fraud
and
not
by
violence
and
indeed
violence
if
there
had
been
an
opportunity
of
using
it
would
have
been
insignificant
beating
the
guards
and
removing
the
dead
body
by
force
would
have
destroyed
all
pretences
to
a
resurrection
now
surely
the
guards
supposing
them
to
be
enough
in
number
to
withstand
all
violence
were
at
least
sufficient
to
prevent
or
to
discover
fraud
what
occasion
then
to
hasten
the
plot
for
fear
of
numbers
meeting
at
the
tomb
since
there
were
numbers
always
present
sufficient
to
discover
any
fraud
the
only
method
that
could
be
used
in
the
case
suppose
then
that
we
could
not
give
a
satisfactory
account
of
the
way
of
reckoning
the
time
from
the
crucifixion
to
the
resurrection
yet
this
we
can
say
that
the
resurrection
happened
during
the
time
that
the
guards
had
the
sepulchre
in
keeping
and
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
what
opportunity
this
could
give
to
fraud
had
the
time
been
delayed
the
guards
removed
and
then
a
resurrection
pretended
it
might
with
some
colour
of
reason
have
been
said
why
did
he
not
come
within
his
time
why
did
he
chuse
to
come
after
his
time
when
all
witnesses
who
had
patiently
expected
the
appointed
hour
were
withdrawn
but
now
what
is
to
be
objected
you
think
he
came
too
soon
but
were
not
your
guards
at
the
door
when
he
came
did
they
not
see
what
happened
and
what
other
satisfaction
could
you
have
had
supposing
he
had
come
a
day
later
by
saying
of
this
i
do
not
mean
the
decline
the
objection
which
is
founded
upon
a
mistake
of
a
way
of
speaking
common
to
the
jews
and
other
people
who
when
they
name
any
number
of
days
and
years
include
the
first
and
last
of
the
days
or
years
to
make
up
the
sum
christ
alluding
to
his
own
resurrection
says
in
three
days
i
will
raise
it
up
the
angels
report
his
prediction
thus
the
son
of
man
shall
be
crucified
and
the
third
day
rise
again
elsewhere
it
is
said
after
three
days
and
again
that
he
was
to
be
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
three
days
and
three
nights
these
expressions
are
equivalent
to
each
other
for
we
always
reckon
the
night
into
the
day
when
we
reckon
by
so
many
days
if
you
agree
to
do
a
thing
ten
days
hence
you
stipulate
for
forbearance
for
the
nights
as
well
as
days
and
therefore
in
reckoning
two
days
and
two
days
and
two
nights
are
the
same
thing
that
the
expression
after
three
days
means
inclusive
days
is
proved
by
grotius
on
matt
xxvii
and
by
others
the
prediction
therefore
was
that
he
would
rise
on
the
third
day
now
he
was
crucified
on
friday
and
buried
he
lay
in
the
grave
all
saturday
and
rose
early
on
sunday
morning
but
the
gentleman
thinks
he
ought
not
to
have
risen
before
monday
pray
try
what
the
use
of
common
language
requires
to
be
understood
in
a
like
case
suppose
you
were
told
that
your
friend
sickened
on
friday
was
let
blood
on
saturday
and
the
third
day
he
died
what
day
would
you
think
he
died
on
if
you
have
any
doubt
about
it
put
the
question
to
the
first
plain
man
you
meet
and
he
will
resolve
it
the
jews
could
have
no
doubt
in
this
case
for
so
they
practised
in
one
of
the
highest
points
of
their
law
every
male
child
was
to
be
circumcised
on
the
eighth
day
how
did
they
reckon
the
days
why
the
day
of
the
birth
was
one
and
the
day
of
the
circumcision
another
and
though
a
child
was
born
towards
the
every
end
of
the
first
day
he
was
capable
of
circumcision
on
any
time
of
the
eighth
day
and
therefore
it
is
not
new
nor
strange
that
the
third
day
in
our
case
should
be
reckoned
into
the
number
though
christ
rose
at
the
very
beginning
of
it
it
is
more
strange
to
reckon
whole
years
in
this
manner
and
yet
this
is
the
constant
method
observed
in
ptolemy
canon
the
most
valuable
piece
of
ancient
chronology
next
to
the
bible
now
extant
if
a
king
lived
over
the
first
day
of
a
year
and
died
the
week
after
that
whole
year
is
reckoned
to
his
reign
i
have
now
gone
through
the
several
objections
upon
this
head
what
credit
they
may
gain
in
this
age
i
know
not
but
is
plain
they
had
no
credit
when
they
were
first
spread
abroad
nay
is
evident
that
the
very
persons
who
set
abroad
this
story
of
the
body
being
stolen
did
not
believe
it
themselves
and
not
to
insist
here
upon
the
plain
fact
which
was
that
the
guards
were
hired
to
tell
this
lie
by
the
chief
priests
it
will
appear
from
the
after
conduct
of
the
chief
priests
themselves
that
they
were
conscious
that
the
story
was
false
not
long
after
the
resurrection
of
christ
the
disciples
having
received
new
power
from
above
appeard
publickly
in
jerusalem
and
in
the
very
temple
and
testified
the
resurrection
of
christ
even
before
those
who
had
murdered
him
what
now
do
the
chief
priests
do
they
seize
upon
the
apostles
they
threaten
them
they
beat
them
they
scourge
them
and
all
to
stop
their
mouths
insisting
that
they
should
say
no
more
of
the
matter
but
why
did
they
not
when
they
had
the
disciples
in
their
power
charge
them
directly
with
their
notorious
cheat
in
stealing
the
body
and
expose
them
to
the
people
as
imposters
this
had
been
much
more
to
their
purpose
than
all
their
menaces
and
ill
usage
and
would
more
effectually
have
undeceived
the
people
but
of
this
not
one
word
is
said
they
try
to
murder
them
enter
into
combinations
to
assassinate
them
prevail
with
herod
to
put
one
of
them
to
death
but
not
so
much
as
a
charge
against
them
of
any
fraud
in
the
resurrection
their
orator
tertullus
who
could
not
have
missed
so
fine
a
topick
of
declamation
had
there
been
but
a
suspicion
to
support
it
is
quite
silent
on
this
head
and
is
content
to
flourish
on
the
of
sedition
and
heresy
profaning
the
temple
and
the
like
very
trifles
to
his
cause
in
comparison
to
the
other
accusation
had
there
been
any
ground
to
make
use
of
it
and
yet
as
it
happens
we
are
sure
the
very
question
of
the
resurrection
came
under
debate
for
festus
tells
king
agrippa
that
the
jews
had
certain
questions
against
paul
of
one
jesus
which
was
dead
whom
paul
affirmed
to
be
alive
after
this
agrippa
hears
paul
himself
and
had
he
suspected
much
less
had
he
been
convinced
that
there
was
a
cheat
in
the
resurrection
he
would
hardly
have
said
to
paul
at
the
end
of
the
conference
almost
thou
persuadest
me
to
be
a
christian
but
let
us
see
what
the
council
and
senate
of
the
children
of
israel
thought
of
this
matter
in
the
most
solemn
and
serious
deliberation
they
ever
had
about
it
not
long
after
the
resurrection
the
apostles
were
taken
the
high
priest
thought
the
matter
of
that
weight
that
he
summoned
the
council
and
senate
of
the
children
of
israel
the
apostles
are
brought
before
them
and
make
their
defence
part
of
their
defence
is
in
these
words
the
god
of
our
fathers
raised
up
jesus
whom
ye
slew
and
hanged
on
a
tree
the
defence
was
indeed
a
heavy
charge
upon
the
senate
and
in
the
warmth
of
their
anger
their
first
resolution
was
to
slay
them
all
but
gamaliel
one
of
the
council
stood
up
and
told
them
that
the
matter
deserved
more
consideration
he
recounted
to
them
the
history
of
several
imposters
who
had
perished
and
concluded
with
respect
to
the
case
of
the
apostles
then
before
them
if
this
work
be
of
men
it
will
come
to
nought
but
if
it
be
of
god
ye
can
not
overthrow
it
lest
haply
ye
be
found
to
fight
against
god
the
council
agreed
to
this
advice
and
after
some
ill
treatment
the
apostles
were
discharged
i
ask
now
and
let
any
man
of
common
sense
answer
could
gamaliel
possibly
have
given
this
advice
and
supposed
that
the
hand
of
god
might
be
with
the
apostles
if
he
had
known
that
there
was
a
cheat
discovered
in
the
resurrection
of
jesus
could
the
whole
senate
have
followed
this
advice
had
they
believed
the
discovery
of
the
cheat
was
there
not
among
them
one
man
wise
enough
to
say
how
can
you
suppose
god
to
have
anything
to
do
in
this
affair
when
the
resurrection
of
jesus
upon
which
all
depends
was
a
notorious
cheat
and
manifestly
proved
to
be
so
i
should
but
lessen
the
weight
of
this
authority
by
saying
more
and
therefore
i
will
rest
here
and
give
way
to
the
gentleman
to
go
on
with
his
accusation
a
my
lord
before
i
proceed
any
further
i
beg
leave
to
say
a
few
words
in
reply
to
what
the
gentleman
has
offered
on
this
head
the
gentleman
thinks
that
the
detection
in
the
case
of
lazarus
ought
to
have
made
the
jews
quite
unconcerned
in
the
case
of
jesus
and
secure
as
to
the
event
of
his
own
resurrection
he
says
very
true
supposing
their
care
had
been
for
themselves
but
governors
have
another
care
upon
their
hands
the
care
of
their
people
and
is
not
enough
for
them
to
guard
against
being
imposed
on
themselves
they
must
be
watchful
to
guard
the
multitude
against
frauds
and
deceits
the
chief
priests
were
satisfied
indeed
of
the
fraud
in
the
case
of
lazarus
yet
they
saw
the
people
deceived
by
it
and
for
this
reason
and
not
for
their
own
satisfaction
they
used
the
caution
in
the
case
of
the
resurrection
of
jesus
which
i
before
laid
before
you
in
so
doing
they
are
well
justified
and
the
inconsistency
charged
on
the
other
side
between
their
opinion
of
jesus
and
their
fear
of
being
imposed
on
by
his
pretended
resurrection
is
fully
answered
the
next
observation
relates
to
the
seal
of
the
sepulchre
the
gentleman
thinks
the
seal
was
used
as
a
check
upon
the
roman
soldiers
but
what
reason
had
the
jews
to
suspect
them
they
were
not
disciples
of
jesus
they
were
servants
of
the
roman
governor
and
employed
in
the
service
of
the
jews
and
i
leave
it
to
the
court
to
judge
whether
the
jews
set
the
seal
to
guard
against
their
friends
or
their
enemies
but
if
the
seals
were
really
used
against
the
guards
then
the
breaking
of
the
seals
is
a
proof
that
the
guards
were
corrupted
and
if
so
easy
to
conceive
how
the
body
was
removed
as
to
the
disciples
the
gentleman
observes
that
the
part
allotted
them
in
the
management
of
the
resurrection
supposes
an
unaccountable
change
in
their
character
it
will
not
be
long
before
the
gentleman
will
have
occasion
for
as
great
a
change
in
their
character
for
these
weak
men
you
will
find
soon
employed
in
converting
the
world
and
sent
to
appear
before
kings
and
princes
in
the
name
of
their
master
soon
you
will
see
them
grow
wise
and
powerful
and
every
way
qualified
for
their
extensive
and
important
business
the
only
difference
between
me
and
the
gentleman
on
the
other
side
will
be
found
to
be
this
that
i
date
this
change
a
little
earlier
than
he
does
a
small
matter
surely
to
determine
the
right
of
this
controversy
the
last
observation
relates
to
king
agrippa
complaisance
to
paul
and
gamaliel
advice
i
can
not
answer
for
agrippa
meaning
but
certainly
he
meant
but
little
and
if
this
matter
is
to
be
tried
by
his
opinion
we
know
that
he
never
did
turn
christian
as
for
gamaliel
is
probable
that
he
saw
great
numbers
of
the
people
engaged
zealously
in
favour
of
the
apostles
and
might
think
it
prudent
to
pass
the
matter
over
in
silence
and
not
to
come
to
extremities
this
is
a
common
case
in
all
governments
the
multitude
and
their
leaders
often
escape
punishment
not
because
they
do
not
deserve
it
but
because
it
is
not
in
some
circumstances
prudent
to
exact
it
i
pass
over
these
things
lightly
because
the
next
article
contains
the
great
to
us
indeed
who
live
at
this
distance
the
only
great
question
for
whatever
reason
the
jews
had
to
believe
the
resurrection
it
is
nothing
to
us
unless
the
story
has
been
conveyed
to
us
upon
such
evidence
as
is
sufficient
to
support
the
weight
laid
on
it
my
lord
we
are
now
to
enter
upon
the
last
and
main
article
of
this
case
the
nature
of
the
evidence
upon
which
the
credit
of
the
resurrection
stands
before
i
inquire
into
the
qualifications
of
the
particular
witnesses
whose
words
we
are
desired
to
take
in
this
case
i
would
ask
why
this
evidence
which
manifestly
relates
to
the
most
essential
point
of
christianity
was
not
put
beyond
all
exception
many
of
the
miracles
of
christ
are
said
to
be
done
in
the
streets
nay
even
in
the
temple
under
the
observation
of
all
the
world
but
the
like
is
not
so
much
as
pretended
as
to
this
nay
we
have
it
upon
the
confession
of
peter
the
ringleader
of
the
apostles
that
christ
appeared
not
to
all
the
people
but
unto
witnesses
chosen
before
of
god
why
picking
and
culling
of
witnesses
in
this
case
more
than
in
any
other
does
it
not
import
some
suspicion
raise
some
jealousy
that
this
case
would
not
bear
the
publick
light
i
would
ask
more
particularly
why
did
not
jesus
after
his
resurrection
appear
openly
to
the
chief
priests
and
rulers
of
the
jews
since
his
commission
related
to
them
in
an
especial
manner
why
were
not
his
credentials
laid
before
them
the
resurrection
is
acknowledged
to
be
the
chief
proof
of
his
mission
why
then
was
it
concealed
from
those
who
were
more
than
all
others
concerned
in
the
event
of
his
mission
suppose
an
ambassador
from
some
foreign
prince
should
come
into
england
make
his
publick
entry
through
the
city
pay
and
receive
visits
and
at
last
refuse
to
shew
any
letters
of
credence
or
to
wait
on
the
king
what
would
you
think
of
him
whatever
you
would
think
in
that
case
you
must
think
in
this
for
there
is
no
difference
between
them
but
we
must
take
the
evidence
as
it
is
it
was
thought
proper
in
this
case
to
have
select
chosen
witnesses
and
we
must
now
consider
who
they
were
and
what
reason
we
have
to
take
their
word
the
first
witness
was
an
angel
or
angels
they
appeared
like
men
to
some
women
who
went
early
to
the
sepulchre
if
they
appeared
like
men
upon
what
ground
are
we
to
take
them
for
angels
the
women
saw
men
and
therefore
they
can
witness
only
to
the
seeing
of
men
but
i
suppose
it
is
the
women
judgement
and
not
their
evidence
that
we
are
to
follow
in
this
case
here
then
we
have
a
story
of
one
apparition
to
support
the
credit
of
another
apparition
and
the
first
apparition
hath
not
so
much
as
the
evidence
of
the
women
to
support
it
but
is
grounded
on
their
superstition
ignorance
and
fear
every
country
can
afford
an
hundred
instances
of
this
kind
and
there
is
this
common
to
them
all
that
as
learning
and
common
sense
prevail
in
any
country
they
die
away
and
are
no
more
heard
of
the
next
witnesses
are
the
women
themselves
the
wisest
men
can
hardly
guard
themselves
against
the
fears
of
superstition
poor
silly
women
therefore
in
this
case
must
needs
be
unexceptionable
witnesses
and
fit
to
be
admitted
into
the
number
of
the
chosen
witnesses
to
attest
this
fact
one
part
of
the
account
given
of
them
is
very
rational
that
they
were
surprised
and
frightened
beyond
measure
and
i
leave
it
to
your
lordship
and
the
court
to
judge
how
well
qualified
they
were
to
give
a
just
relation
of
what
passed
after
this
jesus
appears
to
two
of
his
disciples
as
they
were
upon
a
journey
he
joins
them
and
introduces
a
discourse
about
himself
and
spent
much
time
till
it
began
to
grow
dark
in
expounding
the
prophecies
relating
to
the
death
and
resurrection
of
the
messias
all
this
while
the
disciples
knew
him
not
but
then
going
into
an
house
to
lodge
together
at
supper
he
broke
bread
and
gave
it
to
them
immediately
they
knew
him
immediately
he
vanished
here
then
are
two
witnesses
more
but
what
will
you
call
them
why
their
eyes
were
open
and
they
had
their
senses
when
he
reasoned
with
them
and
they
knew
him
not
so
far
therefore
they
are
witnesses
that
it
was
not
he
tell
us
therefore
upon
what
account
you
reject
the
evidence
of
their
sense
before
the
breaking
of
the
bread
and
insist
on
it
afterwards
and
why
did
jesus
vanish
as
soon
as
known
which
has
more
of
the
air
of
an
apparition
than
of
the
appearance
of
a
real
man
restored
to
life
cleopas
who
was
one
of
these
two
disciples
finds
out
the
apostles
to
make
the
report
of
what
had
passed
to
them
no
sooner
was
the
story
told
but
jesus
appears
among
them
they
were
all
frightened
and
confounded
and
thought
they
saw
a
spectre
he
rebukes
them
for
infidelity
and
their
slowness
in
believing
the
prophecies
of
his
resurrection
and
though
he
refused
before
to
let
the
women
touch
him
a
circumstance
which
i
ought
not
to
have
omitted
yet
now
he
invites
the
apostles
to
handle
him
to
examine
his
hands
and
feet
and
search
the
wounds
of
the
cross
but
what
body
was
it
they
examined
the
same
that
came
in
when
the
doors
were
shut
the
same
that
vanished
from
the
two
disciples
the
same
that
the
women
might
not
touch
in
a
word
a
body
quite
different
from
a
human
body
which
we
know
can
not
pass
through
walls
or
appear
or
disappear
at
pleasure
what
then
could
their
hands
or
eyes
inform
them
of
in
this
case
besides
is
it
credible
that
god
should
raise
a
body
imperfectly
with
the
very
wounds
in
it
of
which
it
died
or
if
the
wounds
were
such
as
destroyed
the
body
before
how
could
a
natural
body
subsist
with
them
afterwards
there
are
more
appearances
of
jesus
recorded
but
so
much
of
the
same
kind
so
liable
to
the
same
difficulties
and
objections
that
i
will
not
trouble
your
lordship
and
the
court
with
a
distinct
enumeration
of
them
if
the
gentleman
on
the
other
side
finds
any
advantage
in
any
of
them
more
than
in
these
mentioned
i
shall
have
an
opportunity
to
consider
them
in
my
reply
it
may
seem
surprising
to
you
perhaps
that
a
matter
of
this
moment
was
trusted
upon
such
evidence
as
this
but
it
will
be
still
more
surprising
to
consider
that
the
several
nations
who
received
the
gospel
and
submitted
to
the
faith
of
this
article
had
not
even
this
evidence
for
what
people
or
nation
had
the
evidence
of
the
angels
the
women
or
even
of
all
the
apostles
so
far
from
it
that
every
country
had
its
single
apostle
and
received
the
faith
upon
the
credit
of
his
single
evidence
we
have
followed
our
ancestors
without
inquiry
and
if
you
examine
the
thing
to
the
bottom
our
belief
was
originally
built
upon
the
word
of
one
man
i
shall
trouble
you
sir
but
with
one
observation
more
which
is
this
that
although
in
common
life
we
act
in
a
thousand
instances
upon
the
faith
and
credit
of
human
testimony
yet
the
reason
for
so
doing
is
not
the
same
in
the
case
before
us
in
common
affairs
where
nothing
is
asserted
but
what
is
probable
and
possible
according
to
the
usual
course
of
nature
a
reasonable
degree
of
evidence
ought
to
determine
every
man
for
the
very
probability
or
possibility
of
the
thing
is
an
support
to
the
evidence
and
in
such
cases
we
have
no
doubt
but
a
man
senses
qualify
him
to
be
a
witness
but
when
the
thing
testified
is
contrary
to
the
order
of
nature
and
at
first
sight
at
least
impossible
what
evidence
can
be
sufficient
to
overturn
the
constant
evidence
of
nature
which
she
gives
us
in
the
uniform
and
regular
method
of
her
operations
if
a
man
tells
me
he
has
been
in
france
i
ought
to
give
a
reason
for
not
believing
him
but
if
he
tells
me
he
comes
from
the
grave
what
reason
can
he
give
why
i
should
believe
him
in
the
case
before
us
since
the
body
raised
from
the
grave
differed
from
common
natural
bodies
as
we
have
before
seen
how
can
i
be
assured
that
the
apostles
senses
qualified
them
to
judge
at
all
of
this
body
whether
it
was
the
same
or
not
the
same
which
was
buried
they
handled
the
body
which
yet
could
pass
through
doors
and
walls
they
saw
it
and
sometimes
knew
it
at
other
times
knew
it
not
in
a
word
it
seems
to
be
a
case
exempt
from
human
evidence
men
have
limited
senses
and
a
limited
reason
when
they
act
within
their
limits
we
may
give
credit
to
them
but
when
they
talk
of
things
removed
beyond
the
reach
of
their
senses
and
reason
we
must
quit
our
own
if
we
believe
theirs
b
my
lord
in
answering
the
objections
under
this
head
i
shall
find
myself
obliged
to
change
the
order
in
which
the
gentleman
thought
proper
to
place
them
he
began
with
complaining
that
christ
did
not
appear
publickly
to
the
jews
after
his
resurrection
and
especially
to
the
chief
priests
and
rulers
and
seemed
to
argue
as
if
such
evidence
would
have
put
the
matter
in
question
out
of
all
doubt
but
he
concluded
with
an
observation
to
prove
that
no
evidence
in
this
case
can
be
sufficient
that
a
resurrection
is
thing
in
nature
impossible
at
least
impossible
to
be
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
rational
inquirer
if
this
be
the
case
why
does
he
require
more
evidence
since
none
can
be
sufficient
or
to
what
purpose
is
it
to
vindicate
the
particular
evidence
of
the
resurrection
of
christ
so
long
as
this
general
prejudice
that
a
resurrection
is
incapable
of
being
proved
remains
unremoved
i
am
under
a
necessity
therefore
to
consider
this
observation
in
the
first
place
that
it
might
lie
as
a
dead
weight
upon
all
i
have
to
offer
in
support
of
the
evidence
of
christ
resurrection
the
gentleman
allows
it
to
be
reasonable
in
many
cases
to
act
upon
the
testimony
and
credit
of
others
but
he
thinks
this
should
be
confined
to
such
cases
where
the
thing
testified
is
probable
possible
and
according
to
the
usual
course
of
nature
the
gentleman
does
not
i
suppose
pretend
to
know
the
extent
of
all
natural
possibilities
much
less
will
he
suppose
them
to
be
generally
known
and
therefore
his
meaning
must
be
that
the
testimony
of
witnesses
is
to
be
received
only
in
cases
which
appear
to
us
to
be
possible
in
any
other
sense
we
can
have
no
dispute
for
mere
impossibilities
which
can
never
exist
can
never
be
proved
taking
the
observation
therefore
in
this
sense
the
proposition
is
this
that
the
testimony
of
others
ought
not
to
be
admitted
but
in
such
matters
as
appear
probable
or
at
least
possible
to
our
conceptions
for
instance
a
man
who
lives
in
a
warm
climate
and
never
saw
ice
ought
upon
no
evidence
to
believe
that
rivers
freeze
and
grow
hard
in
cold
countries
for
this
is
improbable
contrary
to
the
usual
course
of
nature
and
impossible
according
to
his
notion
of
things
and
yet
we
all
know
that
this
is
a
plain
manifest
case
discernible
by
the
senses
of
men
of
which
therefore
they
are
qualified
to
be
good
witnesses
an
hundred
such
instances
might
be
named
but
is
needless
for
surely
nothing
is
more
apparently
absurd
than
to
make
one
man
ability
in
discerning
and
his
veracity
in
reporting
plain
facts
depend
upon
the
skill
or
ignorance
of
the
hearer
and
what
has
the
gentleman
said
upon
this
occasion
against
the
resurrection
more
than
any
man
who
never
saw
ice
might
say
against
an
hundred
honest
witnesses
who
assert
that
water
turns
to
ice
in
cold
climates
yet
it
is
very
true
that
men
do
not
so
easily
believe
upon
testimony
of
others
things
which
to
them
seem
improbable
or
impossible
but
the
reason
is
not
because
the
thing
itself
admits
no
evidence
but
because
the
hearer
preconceived
opinion
outweighs
the
credit
of
the
reporter
and
makes
his
veracity
to
be
called
in
question
for
instance
it
is
natural
for
a
stone
to
roll
down
hill
it
is
unnatural
for
it
to
roll
up
hill
but
a
stone
moving
uphill
is
as
much
the
object
of
sense
as
a
stone
moving
downhill
and
all
men
in
their
senses
are
as
capable
of
seeing
and
judging
and
reporting
the
fact
in
one
case
as
in
the
other
should
a
man
then
tell
you
that
he
saw
a
stone
go
uphill
of
its
own
accord
you
might
question
his
veracity
but
you
could
not
say
the
thing
admitted
no
evidence
because
it
was
contrary
to
the
law
and
usual
course
of
nature
for
the
law
of
nature
formed
to
yourself
from
your
own
experience
and
reasoning
is
quite
independent
of
the
matter
of
fact
which
the
man
testifies
and
whenever
you
see
facts
yourself
which
contradict
your
notions
of
the
law
of
nature
you
admit
the
facts
because
you
believe
yourself
when
you
do
not
admit
like
facts
upon
the
evidence
of
others
it
is
because
you
do
not
believe
them
and
not
because
the
facts
in
their
own
nature
exclude
all
evidence
suppose
a
man
should
tell
you
that
he
was
come
from
the
dead
you
would
be
apt
to
suspect
his
evidence
but
what
would
you
suspect
that
he
was
not
alive
when
you
heard
him
saw
him
felt
him
and
conversed
with
him
you
could
not
suspect
this
without
giving
up
all
your
senses
and
acting
in
this
case
as
you
act
in
no
other
here
then
you
would
question
whether
the
man
had
ever
been
dead
but
would
you
say
that
it
is
incapable
of
being
made
plain
by
human
testimony
that
this
or
that
man
died
a
year
ago
it
ca
be
said
evidence
in
this
case
is
admitted
in
all
courts
perpetually
consider
it
the
other
way
suppose
you
saw
a
man
publicly
executed
his
body
afterwards
was
wounded
by
the
executioner
and
carried
and
laid
in
the
grave
that
after
this
you
should
be
told
that
the
man
was
come
to
life
again
what
would
you
suspect
in
this
case
not
that
the
man
had
never
been
dead
for
that
you
saw
yourself
but
you
would
suspect
whether
he
was
now
alive
but
would
you
say
this
case
excluded
all
human
testimony
and
that
men
could
not
possibly
discern
whether
one
with
whom
they
conversed
familiarly
was
alive
or
no
upon
what
ground
could
you
say
this
a
man
rising
from
the
grave
is
an
object
of
sense
and
can
give
the
same
evidence
of
his
being
alive
as
any
other
man
in
the
world
can
give
so
that
a
resurrection
considered
only
as
a
fact
to
be
proved
by
evidence
is
a
plain
case
it
requires
no
greater
ability
in
the
witnesses
than
that
they
be
able
to
distinguish
between
a
man
dead
and
a
man
alive
a
point
in
which
i
believe
every
man
living
thinks
himself
a
judge
i
do
allow
that
this
case
and
others
of
like
nature
require
more
evidence
to
give
them
credit
than
ordinary
cases
do
you
may
therefore
require
more
evidence
in
these
than
in
other
cases
but
it
is
absurd
to
say
that
such
cases
admit
no
evidence
when
the
things
in
question
are
manifestly
objects
of
sense
i
allow
further
that
the
gentleman
has
rightly
stated
the
difficulty
upon
the
foot
of
common
prejudice
and
that
it
arises
from
hence
that
such
cases
appear
to
be
contrary
to
the
course
of
nature
but
i
desire
to
consider
what
this
course
of
nature
is
every
man
from
the
lowest
countryman
to
the
highest
philosopher
frames
to
himself
from
his
experience
and
observation
a
notion
of
a
course
of
nature
and
is
ready
to
say
of
everything
reported
to
him
that
contradicts
his
experience
that
it
is
contrary
to
nature
but
will
the
gentleman
say
that
everything
is
impossible
or
even
improbable
that
contradicts
the
notion
which
men
frame
to
themselves
of
the
course
of
nature
i
think
he
will
not
say
it
and
if
he
will
he
must
say
that
water
can
never
freeze
for
it
is
absolutely
inconsistent
with
the
notion
which
men
have
of
the
course
of
nature
who
live
in
the
warm
climates
and
hence
it
appears
that
when
men
talk
of
the
course
of
nature
they
really
talk
of
their
own
prejudices
and
imaginations
and
that
sense
and
reason
are
not
so
much
concerned
in
the
case
as
the
gentleman
imagines
for
i
ask
is
it
from
the
evidence
of
sense
or
the
evidence
of
reason
that
people
of
warm
climates
think
it
contrary
to
nature
that
water
should
grow
solid
and
become
ice
as
for
sense
they
see
indeed
that
water
with
them
is
always
liquid
but
none
of
their
senses
tell
them
that
it
can
never
grow
solid
as
for
reason
it
can
never
so
inform
them
for
right
reason
can
never
contradict
the
truth
of
things
our
senses
then
inform
us
rightly
what
the
usual
course
of
things
is
but
when
we
conclude
that
things
can
not
be
otherwise
we
outrun
the
information
of
our
senses
and
the
conclusion
stands
upon
prejudice
and
not
upon
reason
and
yet
such
conclusions
form
what
is
generally
called
the
course
of
nature
and
when
men
upon
proper
evidence
and
informations
admit
things
contrary
to
this
presupposed
course
of
nature
they
do
not
as
the
gentleman
expresses
it
quit
their
own
sense
and
reason
but
in
truth
they
quit
their
own
mistakes
and
prejudices
in
the
case
before
us
the
case
of
the
resurrection
the
great
difficulty
arises
from
the
like
prejudice
we
all
know
by
experience
that
all
men
die
and
rise
no
more
therefore
we
conclude
that
for
a
dead
man
to
rise
to
life
again
is
contrary
to
the
course
of
nature
and
certainly
it
is
contrary
to
the
uniform
and
settled
course
of
things
but
if
we
argue
from
hence
that
it
is
contrary
and
repugnant
to
the
real
laws
of
nature
and
absolutely
impossible
on
that
account
we
argue
without
any
foundation
to
support
us
either
from
our
senses
or
our
reason
we
can
not
learn
from
our
eyes
or
feeling
or
any
other
sense
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
dead
body
to
live
again
if
we
learn
it
at
all
it
must
be
from
our
reason
and
yet
what
one
maxim
of
reason
is
contradicted
by
the
supposition
of
a
resurrection
for
my
own
part
when
i
consider
how
i
live
that
all
animal
motions
necessary
to
my
life
are
independent
of
my
will
that
my
heart
beats
without
my
consent
and
without
my
direction
that
digestion
and
nutrition
are
performed
by
methods
to
which
i
am
not
conscious
that
my
blood
moves
in
a
perpetual
round
which
is
contrary
to
all
known
laws
of
motion
i
can
not
but
think
that
the
preservation
of
my
life
in
every
moment
of
it
is
as
great
an
act
of
power
as
is
necessary
to
raise
a
dead
man
to
life
and
whoever
so
far
reflects
upon
his
own
being
as
to
acknowledge
that
he
owes
it
to
a
superior
power
must
needs
think
that
the
same
power
which
gave
life
to
senseless
matter
at
first
and
set
all
the
springs
and
movements
at
the
beginning
can
restore
life
to
dead
body
for
surely
it
is
not
a
greater
thing
to
give
life
to
a
body
once
dead
than
to
a
body
that
never
was
alive
in
the
next
place
must
be
considered
the
difficulties
which
the
gentleman
has
laid
before
you
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
body
after
the
resurrection
he
has
produced
some
passages
which
which
he
thinks
imply
that
the
body
was
not
a
real
natural
body
but
a
mere
phantom
or
apparition
and
thence
concludes
that
there
being
no
real
object
of
sense
there
can
be
no
evidence
in
the
case
presumptions
are
of
no
weight
against
positive
evidence
and
every
account
of
the
resurrection
assures
us
that
the
body
of
christ
was
seen
felt
and
handled
by
many
persons
who
were
called
upon
by
christ
so
to
do
that
they
might
be
assured
that
he
had
flesh
and
bones
and
was
not
a
mere
spectre
as
they
in
their
first
surprize
imagined
him
to
be
it
is
impossible
that
they
who
give
this
account
should
mean
by
anything
they
report
to
imply
that
he
had
no
real
body
it
is
certain
then
that
when
the
gentleman
makes
use
of
what
they
say
to
this
purpose
he
uses
their
sayings
contrary
to
their
meaning
for
it
is
not
pretended
that
they
say
that
christ
had
not
a
real
human
body
after
the
resurrection
nor
is
it
pretended
they
had
any
such
thought
except
only
upon
the
first
surprize
of
seeing
him
and
before
they
had
examined
him
with
their
eyes
and
hands
but
something
they
have
said
which
the
gentleman
according
to
his
notions
of
philosophy
thinks
implies
that
the
body
was
not
real
to
clear
this
point
therefore
i
must
lay
before
you
the
passages
referred
to
and
consider
how
justly
the
gentleman
reasons
from
them
the
first
passage
relates
to
mary
magdalene
who
the
first
time
she
saw
christ
was
going
to
embrace
his
feet
as
the
custom
of
the
country
was
christ
says
to
her
john
touch
me
not
for
i
am
not
yet
ascended
to
my
father
but
go
to
my
brethren
and
tell
them
etc
hence
the
gentleman
concludes
that
christ
body
was
not
such
an
one
as
would
bear
the
touch
but
how
does
he
infer
this
is
it
from
these
words
touch
me
not
it
can
not
be
for
thousands
say
it
every
day
without
giving
the
least
suspicion
that
their
bodies
are
not
capable
of
being
touched
the
conclusion
then
must
be
built
on
those
other
words
for
i
have
not
yet
ascended
to
my
father
but
what
have
these
words
to
do
with
the
reality
of
his
body
it
might
be
real
or
not
real
for
anything
that
is
here
said
there
is
a
difficulty
in
these
words
and
it
may
be
hard
to
give
the
true
sense
of
them
but
there
is
no
difficulty
in
seeing
that
they
have
no
relation
to
the
nature
of
christ
body
for
of
his
body
nothing
is
said
the
natural
sense
of
the
place
as
i
collect
by
comparing
this
passage
with
matthew
is
this
mary
magdalene
upon
seeing
jesus
fell
at
his
feet
and
laid
hold
of
them
and
held
them
as
if
she
meant
never
to
let
them
go
christ
said
to
her
touch
me
not
or
hang
not
about
me
now
you
will
have
other
opportunities
of
seeing
me
for
i
go
not
yet
to
my
father
lose
no
time
then
but
go
quickly
with
my
message
to
my
brethren
i
am
not
concerned
to
support
this
particular
interpretation
of
the
passage
it
is
sufficient
to
my
purpose
to
show
that
the
words
can
not
possibly
relate
to
the
nature
of
christ
body
one
way
or
other
the
next
passage
relates
to
christ
joining
two
of
his
disciples
upon
the
road
and
conversing
with
them
without
being
known
by
them
it
grew
dark
they
pressed
him
to
stay
with
them
that
night
he
went
in
with
them
broke
bread
blessed
it
and
gave
it
them
and
then
they
knew
him
and
immediately
he
disappeared
the
circumstance
of
disappearing
shall
be
considered
under
the
next
head
with
other
objections
of
the
like
kind
at
present
i
shall
only
examine
the
other
parts
of
this
story
and
inquire
whether
they
afford
any
ground
to
conclude
that
the
body
of
christ
was
not
a
real
one
had
this
piece
of
history
been
related
of
any
other
person
i
think
such
suspicion
could
have
risen
for
what
is
there
unnatural
or
uncommon
in
this
account
two
men
meet
an
acquaintance
whom
they
thought
dead
they
converse
with
him
for
some
time
without
suspecting
who
he
was
the
very
persuasion
they
were
under
that
he
was
dead
contributed
greatly
to
their
not
knowing
him
besides
he
appeared
in
a
habit
and
form
different
from
what
he
used
when
he
conversed
with
them
appeared
to
them
on
a
journey
and
walked
with
them
side
by
side
in
which
situation
no
one
of
the
company
has
a
full
view
of
another
afterwards
when
they
were
at
supper
together
and
lights
brought
in
they
plainly
discerned
who
he
was
upon
this
occasion
the
gentleman
asks
what
sort
of
witnesses
these
are
no
before
supper
they
were
says
the
gentleman
that
the
person
whom
they
saw
was
not
christ
and
then
he
demands
a
reason
for
our
rejecting
the
evidence
of
their
sense
when
they
did
not
know
christ
and
insisting
on
it
when
they
did
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
for
men
to
catch
themselves
and
others
by
such
notable
acute
questions
and
to
be
led
by
the
sprightliness
of
their
imagination
out
of
the
road
of
truth
and
common
sense
i
beg
leave
to
tell
the
gentleman
a
short
story
and
then
to
ask
him
his
own
question
a
certain
gentleman
who
had
been
some
years
abroad
happened
in
his
return
to
england
through
paris
to
meet
his
own
sister
there
she
was
not
expecting
to
see
him
there
nor
he
to
see
her
they
conversed
together
with
other
company
at
a
publick
house
for
great
part
of
a
day
without
knowing
each
other
at
last
the
lady
began
to
shew
great
signs
of
disorder
her
color
came
and
went
and
the
eyes
of
the
company
were
drawn
toward
her
and
then
she
cried
out
oh
my
brother
and
was
hardly
held
from
fainting
suppose
now
this
lady
were
to
depose
upon
oath
in
a
court
of
justice
that
she
saw
her
brother
at
paris
i
would
ask
the
gentleman
whether
he
would
object
to
the
evidence
and
say
that
she
was
as
good
an
that
her
brother
was
not
there
as
that
he
was
and
demand
of
the
court
why
they
rejected
the
evidence
of
her
senses
when
she
did
not
know
her
brother
and
were
ready
to
believe
it
when
she
did
when
the
question
is
answered
in
this
case
i
desire
only
to
have
the
benefit
of
it
in
the
case
now
before
you
but
if
you
shall
be
of
opinion
that
there
was
some
extraordinary
power
used
on
this
occasion
and
incline
to
think
that
the
expression
their
eyes
were
holden
imports
as
much
then
the
case
will
fall
under
the
next
article
in
which
we
are
to
consider
christ
vanishing
out
of
sight
his
coming
in
and
going
out
when
the
doors
were
shut
and
such
like
passages
which
as
they
fall
under
one
consideration
so
i
shall
speak
to
them
together
but
it
is
necessary
first
to
see
what
the
apostles
affirm
distinctly
in
their
accounts
of
these
facts
for
i
think
more
has
been
said
for
them
than
ever
they
said
or
intended
to
say
for
themselves
in
one
place
luke
it
is
said
he
vanished
out
of
their
sight
which
translation
is
corrected
in
the
margin
of
our
bibles
thus
he
ceased
to
be
seen
of
them
and
the
original
imports
no
more
it
is
said
in
another
place
that
the
disciples
being
together
and
the
doors
shut
jesus
came
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
them
how
he
came
is
not
said
much
less
is
it
said
that
he
came
through
the
door
or
the
keyhole
and
for
anything
that
is
said
to
the
contrary
he
might
come
in
at
the
door
though
the
disciples
saw
not
the
door
open
nor
him
till
he
was
in
the
midst
of
them
but
the
gentleman
thinks
these
passages
prove
that
the
disciples
saw
no
real
body
but
an
apparition
i
am
afraid
that
the
gentleman
after
all
his
contempt
of
apparitions
and
the
superstition
on
which
they
are
founded
has
fallen
into
the
snare
himself
and
is
arguing
upon
no
better
principles
than
the
common
notions
which
the
vulgar
have
of
apparitions
why
else
does
he
imagine
these
passages
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
reality
of
christ
body
is
there
no
way
for
a
real
body
to
disappear
try
the
experiment
now
do
but
put
out
the
candles
we
shall
all
disappear
if
a
man
falls
asleep
in
the
all
things
disappear
to
him
his
senses
are
all
locked
up
and
yet
all
things
about
him
continue
to
be
real
and
his
senses
continue
perfect
as
shutting
out
all
rays
of
light
would
make
all
things
disappear
so
intercepting
the
rays
of
light
from
any
particular
body
would
make
that
disappear
perhaps
something
like
this
was
the
case
or
perhaps
something
else
which
we
know
not
but
be
the
case
what
it
will
the
gentleman
conclusion
is
founded
on
no
principle
of
true
philosophy
for
it
does
not
follow
that
a
body
is
not
real
because
i
lose
sight
of
it
suddenly
i
shall
be
told
perhaps
that
this
way
of
accounting
for
the
passages
is
as
wonderful
and
as
much
out
of
the
common
course
of
things
as
the
other
perhaps
it
is
so
and
what
then
surely
the
gentleman
does
not
expect
that
in
order
to
prove
the
reality
of
the
greatest
miracle
that
ever
was
i
should
shew
that
there
was
nothing
miraculous
in
it
but
that
everything
happened
according
to
the
ordinary
course
of
things
my
only
concern
is
to
shew
that
these
passages
do
not
infer
that
the
body
of
christ
after
the
resurrection
was
no
real
body
i
wonder
the
gentleman
did
not
carry
his
argument
a
little
further
and
prove
that
christ
before
his
death
had
no
real
body
for
we
read
that
when
the
multitude
would
have
thrown
him
down
a
precipice
he
went
through
the
midst
of
them
unseen
now
nothing
happened
after
his
resurrection
more
unaccountable
than
this
that
happened
before
it
and
if
the
argument
be
good
at
all
it
will
be
good
to
prove
that
there
never
was
such
a
man
as
jesus
in
the
world
perhaps
the
gentleman
may
think
that
this
is
a
little
too
much
to
prove
and
if
he
does
i
hope
he
will
quit
the
argument
in
one
case
as
well
as
in
the
other
for
difference
there
is
none
hitherto
we
have
been
called
upon
to
prove
the
reality
of
christ
body
and
that
it
was
the
same
after
the
resurrection
that
was
before
but
the
next
objection
complains
that
the
body
was
too
much
the
same
with
that
which
was
buried
for
the
gentleman
thinks
that
it
had
the
same
mortal
wounds
open
and
uncured
of
which
he
died
his
observation
is
grounded
upon
the
words
which
christ
uses
to
thomas
john
reach
hither
thy
finger
and
behold
my
hands
and
reach
hither
thy
hand
and
thrust
it
into
my
side
is
it
here
affirmed
that
thomas
did
actually
put
his
hand
into
his
side
or
so
much
as
see
his
wounds
fresh
and
bleeding
nothing
like
it
but
it
is
supposed
from
the
words
of
christ
for
if
he
had
no
wounds
he
would
not
have
invited
thomas
to
probe
them
now
the
meaning
of
christ
will
best
appear
by
an
account
of
the
occasion
he
had
to
use
this
speech
he
had
appeared
to
his
disciples
in
the
absence
of
thomas
and
shewn
them
his
hands
and
feet
which
still
had
the
marks
of
his
crucifixion
the
disciples
report
this
to
thomas
he
thought
the
thing
impossible
and
expressed
his
unbelief
as
men
are
apt
to
do
when
they
are
positive
in
a
very
extravagant
manner
you
talk
says
he
of
the
prints
of
the
nails
in
his
hands
and
feet
for
my
part
says
he
i
never
believe
this
thing
except
i
shall
see
in
his
hands
the
print
of
the
nails
and
put
my
finger
into
the
print
of
the
nails
and
thrust
my
hand
into
his
side
now
in
the
first
place
here
is
nothing
said
of
open
wounds
thomas
talks
only
of
putting
his
finger
into
the
print
that
is
the
scar
of
the
nails
and
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
side
and
in
common
speech
to
thrust
an
hand
into
any
one
side
does
not
signify
to
thrust
it
through
the
side
into
the
bowels
upon
this
interpretation
of
the
words
which
is
a
plain
and
natural
one
the
gentleman
objection
is
quite
gone
but
suppose
thomas
to
mean
what
the
gentleman
means
in
that
case
the
words
of
christ
are
manifestly
a
severe
reproach
to
him
for
his
infidelity
here
says
christ
are
my
hands
and
my
side
take
the
satisfaction
you
require
thrust
your
fingers
into
my
hands
your
hand
into
my
side
repeating
to
him
his
own
words
and
calling
him
to
his
own
conditions
which
to
a
man
beginning
to
see
his
extravagance
is
of
all
rebukes
the
severest
such
forms
of
speech
are
used
on
many
occasions
and
are
never
understood
to
import
that
the
thing
proposed
is
proper
or
always
practicable
when
the
grecian
women
reproached
their
sons
with
cowardice
and
called
to
them
as
they
were
flying
from
the
enemy
to
come
and
hide
themselves
like
children
as
they
were
in
their
mothers
wombs
he
would
be
ridiculous
who
had
asked
the
question
whether
the
women
really
thought
they
could
take
their
sons
into
their
wombs
again
i
have
now
gone
through
the
objections
which
were
necessarily
to
be
removed
before
i
could
state
the
evidence
in
this
case
i
am
sensible
i
have
taken
up
too
much
of
your
time
but
i
have
this
to
say
in
my
excuse
that
objections
built
on
popular
notions
and
prejudices
are
easily
conveyed
to
the
mind
in
few
words
and
so
conveyed
make
strong
impressions
but
whoever
answers
the
objections
must
encounter
all
the
notions
to
which
they
are
allied
and
to
which
they
owe
their
strength
and
it
is
well
if
with
many
words
he
can
find
admittance
i
come
now
to
consider
the
evidence
on
which
our
belief
of
the
resurrection
stands
and
here
i
am
stopped
again
a
general
exception
is
taken
to
the
evidence
that
it
is
imperfect
unfair
and
a
question
is
asked
why
did
not
christ
appear
publickly
to
all
the
people
especially
to
the
magistrates
why
were
some
witnesses
culled
and
chosen
out
and
others
excluded
it
may
be
sufficient
perhaps
to
say
that
where
there
are
witnesses
enow
no
judge
no
jury
complains
for
want
of
more
and
therefore
if
the
witnesses
we
have
are
sufficient
it
is
no
objection
that
we
have
not
others
and
more
if
three
credible
man
attest
a
will
which
are
as
many
as
the
law
requires
would
any
body
ask
why
all
the
town
were
not
called
to
set
their
hands
but
why
were
these
witnesses
culled
and
chosen
out
why
for
this
reason
that
they
might
be
good
ones
does
not
every
wise
men
chuse
proper
witnesses
to
his
deed
and
to
his
will
and
does
not
a
good
choice
of
witnesses
give
strength
to
every
deed
how
comes
it
to
pass
then
that
the
very
thing
which
shuts
out
all
suspicion
in
other
cases
should
in
this
case
only
be
of
all
others
the
most
suspicious
thing
itself
what
reason
there
is
to
make
any
complaints
on
the
behalf
of
the
jews
may
be
judged
in
part
from
what
has
already
appeared
christ
suffered
openly
in
their
sight
and
they
were
so
well
apprised
of
his
prediction
that
he
should
rise
again
that
they
set
a
guard
on
his
sepulchre
and
from
their
guards
they
learned
the
truth
every
soldier
was
to
them
a
witness
of
the
resurrection
of
their
own
chusing
after
this
they
had
not
one
apostle
which
the
gentleman
observes
was
the
case
of
other
people
but
all
the
apostles
and
many
other
witnesses
with
them
and
in
their
power
the
apostles
testified
the
resurrection
to
them
not
only
to
the
people
but
to
the
elders
of
israel
assembled
in
senate
to
support
their
evidence
they
were
enabled
to
work
and
did
work
miracles
openly
in
the
name
of
christ
these
people
therefore
have
the
least
reason
to
complain
and
had
of
all
others
the
fullest
evidence
and
in
some
respects
such
as
none
but
themselves
could
have
for
they
only
were
keepers
of
the
believe
if
the
gentleman
was
to
chuse
an
evidence
to
his
own
satisfaction
in
a
like
case
he
would
desire
no
more
than
to
keep
the
sepulchre
with
a
sufficient
number
of
guards
but
the
argument
goes
further
it
is
said
that
jesus
was
sent
with
a
special
commission
to
the
jews
that
he
was
their
messias
and
as
his
resurrection
was
his
main
credential
he
ought
to
have
appeared
publickly
to
the
rulers
of
the
jews
after
his
resurrection
that
in
doing
otherwise
he
acted
like
an
ambassador
pretending
authority
from
his
prince
but
refusing
to
show
his
letters
of
credence
i
was
afraid
when
i
suffered
myself
to
be
drawn
into
this
argument
that
i
should
be
led
into
matters
fitter
to
be
decided
by
men
of
another
profession
than
by
lawyers
but
since
there
is
no
help
now
i
will
lay
before
you
what
appears
to
me
to
be
the
natural
and
plain
account
of
this
matter
leaving
it
to
others
who
are
better
qualified
to
give
a
fuller
answer
to
the
objection
it
appears
to
me
by
the
accounts
we
have
of
jesus
that
he
had
two
distinct
offices
one
as
the
messias
particularly
promised
to
the
jews
another
as
he
was
to
be
the
great
high
priest
of
the
world
with
respect
to
the
first
office
he
is
called
heb
the
apostle
of
the
hebrews
the
rom
minister
of
the
circumcision
and
says
himself
matt
i
am
not
sent
but
unto
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
isreal
accordingly
when
he
sent
out
his
apostles
in
his
lifetime
to
preach
he
expressly
forbids
them
to
go
to
the
gentiles
or
samaritans
but
go
matt
says
he
to
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
israel
christ
continued
in
the
discharge
of
this
office
during
the
time
of
his
natural
life
till
he
was
finally
rejected
by
the
jews
and
it
is
observable
that
the
last
time
he
spoke
to
the
people
according
to
matthew
account
he
solemnly
took
leave
of
them
and
closed
his
commission
he
had
been
long
among
them
publishing
glad
tidings
but
when
all
his
preaching
all
his
miracles
had
proved
to
be
in
vain
the
last
thing
he
did
was
to
denounce
the
woes
they
had
brought
on
themselves
the
chapter
of
matthew
recites
these
woes
and
at
the
end
of
them
christ
takes
this
passionate
leave
of
jerusalem
oh
jerusalem
jerusalem
thou
that
killest
the
prophets
and
stonest
them
which
are
sent
unto
thee
how
often
would
i
have
gathered
thy
children
together
even
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
under
her
wings
and
ye
would
not
behold
your
house
is
left
unto
you
desolate
for
i
say
unto
you
ye
shall
not
see
me
henceforth
till
ye
shall
say
blessed
is
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
it
is
remarkable
that
this
passage
as
recorded
by
matthew
and
luke
twice
over
is
determined
by
the
circumstances
to
refer
to
the
near
approach
of
his
own
death
and
the
extreme
hatred
of
the
jews
to
him
and
therefore
those
words
ye
shall
not
see
me
henceforth
are
to
be
dated
from
the
time
of
his
death
and
manifestly
point
out
the
end
of
his
particular
mission
to
them
from
the
making
this
declaration
as
it
stands
in
matthew
his
discourses
are
to
his
disciples
and
they
chiefly
relate
to
the
miserable
and
wretched
condition
of
the
jews
which
was
now
decreed
and
soon
to
be
accomplished
let
me
now
ask
whether
in
this
state
of
things
any
farther
credentials
of
commission
to
the
jews
could
be
demanded
or
expected
he
was
rejected
his
commission
was
determined
and
with
it
the
fate
of
the
nation
was
determined
also
what
use
then
of
more
credentials
as
to
appearing
to
them
after
his
resurrection
he
could
not
do
it
consistently
with
his
own
prediction
ye
shall
see
me
no
more
till
ye
shall
say
blessed
is
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
the
jews
were
not
in
this
disposition
after
the
resurrection
nor
are
they
in
it
yet
the
resurrection
was
the
foundation
of
christ
new
commission
which
extended
to
all
the
world
then
it
was
he
declared
that
all
power
was
given
unto
him
in
heaven
and
in
earth
then
he
gave
a
new
commission
to
his
disciples
not
restrained
to
the
house
of
israel
but
to
go
and
teach
all
nations
this
prerogative
the
jews
had
under
this
commission
that
the
gospel
was
first
offered
to
them
but
in
no
other
terms
than
it
was
offered
to
the
rest
of
the
world
since
then
this
commission
of
which
the
resurrection
was
the
foundation
extended
to
all
the
world
alike
what
ground
is
there
to
demand
special
and
particular
evidence
to
the
jews
the
emperor
and
the
senate
of
rome
were
a
much
more
considerable
part
of
the
world
than
the
chief
priests
and
the
synagogue
why
does
not
the
gentleman
object
then
that
christ
did
not
shew
himself
to
tiberius
and
his
senate
and
since
all
men
have
an
equal
right
in
this
case
why
may
not
the
same
demand
be
made
for
every
country
nay
for
every
age
and
then
the
gentleman
may
bring
the
question
nearer
home
and
ask
why
christ
did
not
appear
in
england
in
king
george
reign
there
is
to
my
apprehension
nothing
more
unreasonable
than
to
neglect
and
despise
plain
and
sufficient
evidence
before
us
and
to
sit
down
to
imagine
what
kind
of
evidence
would
have
pleased
us
and
then
to
make
the
want
of
such
evidence
an
objection
to
the
truth
which
yet
if
well
considered
would
be
found
to
be
well
established
the
observation
i
have
made
upon
the
resurrection
of
christ
naturally
leads
to
another
which
will
help
to
account
for
the
nature
of
the
evidence
we
have
in
this
great
point
as
the
resurrection
was
the
opening
a
new
commission
in
which
all
the
world
had
an
interest
so
the
concern
naturally
was
to
have
a
proper
evidence
to
establish
this
truth
and
which
should
be
of
equal
weight
to
all
this
did
not
depend
upon
the
satisfaction
given
to
private
persons
whether
they
were
magistrates
or
not
magistrates
but
upon
the
conviction
of
those
whose
office
it
was
to
be
to
bear
testimony
to
this
truth
in
the
world
in
this
sense
the
apostles
were
chosen
to
be
witnesses
of
the
resurrection
because
they
were
chosen
to
bear
testimony
to
it
in
the
world
and
not
because
they
only
were
admitted
to
see
christ
after
his
resurrection
for
the
fact
is
otherwise
the
gospel
indeed
concerned
to
shew
the
evidence
on
which
the
faith
of
the
world
was
to
rest
is
very
particular
in
setting
forth
the
ocular
demonstration
which
the
apostles
had
of
the
resurrection
and
mentions
others
who
saw
christ
after
his
resurrection
only
accidentally
and
as
the
thread
of
the
history
led
to
it
but
yet
it
is
certain
there
were
many
others
who
had
this
satisfaction
as
well
as
the
apostles
luke
tells
us
that
when
christ
appeared
to
the
eleven
apostles
there
were
others
with
them
luke
who
they
were
or
how
many
there
were
he
says
not
but
it
appears
in
the
acts
when
an
apostle
was
to
be
chosen
in
the
room
of
judas
and
the
chief
qualification
required
was
that
he
should
be
one
capable
of
being
a
witness
of
the
resurrection
that
there
were
present
an
hundred
and
twenty
so
qualified
acts
compare
vv
together
and
saint
paul
says
that
christ
after
his
rising
was
seen
by
at
once
many
of
whom
were
living
when
he
appealed
to
their
evidence
so
that
the
gentleman
is
mistaken
when
he
imagines
that
a
few
only
were
chosen
to
see
christ
after
he
came
from
the
grave
the
truth
of
the
case
is
that
out
of
those
who
saw
him
some
were
chosen
to
bear
testimony
to
the
world
and
for
that
reason
had
the
fullest
demonstration
of
the
truth
that
they
might
be
the
better
able
to
give
satisfaction
to
others
and
what
was
there
in
this
conduct
to
complain
of
what
to
raise
any
jealousy
or
suspicion
as
to
the
witnesses
themselves
the
first
the
gentleman
takes
notice
of
are
the
angels
and
the
women
the
mention
of
angels
led
naturally
to
apparitions
and
the
women
were
called
poor
silly
women
and
there
is
an
end
to
their
evidence
but
to
speak
seriously
will
the
gentleman
pretend
to
prove
that
there
are
no
intelligent
beings
between
god
and
man
or
that
they
are
not
ministers
of
god
or
that
they
were
improperly
employed
in
this
great
and
wonderful
work
the
resurrection
of
christ
till
some
of
these
points
are
disproved
we
may
be
at
rest
for
the
angels
were
ministers
and
not
witnesses
of
the
resurrection
and
it
is
not
upon
the
credit
of
the
poor
silly
women
that
we
believe
angels
were
concerned
but
upon
the
report
of
those
who
wrote
the
gospels
who
deliver
it
as
a
truth
known
to
themselves
and
not
merely
as
a
report
taken
from
the
women
but
for
the
women
what
shall
i
say
silly
as
they
were
i
hope
at
least
they
had
eyes
and
ears
and
could
tell
what
they
heard
and
saw
in
this
case
they
tell
no
more
they
report
that
the
body
was
not
in
the
sepulchre
but
so
far
from
reporting
the
resurrection
that
they
did
not
believe
it
and
were
very
anxious
to
find
to
what
place
the
body
was
removed
further
they
were
not
employed
for
i
think
the
gentleman
in
another
part
observes
rightly
that
they
were
not
sent
to
bear
testimony
to
any
people
but
suppose
them
to
be
witnesses
suppose
them
to
be
improper
ones
yet
the
evidence
of
the
men
surely
is
not
the
worse
because
some
wonen
happened
to
see
the
same
thing
which
they
saw
and
if
men
only
must
be
admitted
of
them
we
have
enow
to
establish
this
truth
i
will
not
spend
your
time
in
enumerating
these
witnesses
or
in
setting
forth
the
demonstration
they
had
of
the
truth
which
they
report
these
things
are
well
known
if
you
question
their
sincerity
they
lived
miserably
and
died
miserably
for
the
sake
of
this
truth
and
what
greater
evidence
of
sincerity
can
man
give
or
require
and
what
is
still
more
they
were
not
deceived
in
their
expectation
of
being
ill
treated
for
he
who
employed
them
told
them
beforehand
that
the
world
would
hate
them
and
treat
them
with
contempt
and
cruelty
but
leaving
these
weighty
and
well
known
circumstances
to
your
own
reflexion
i
beg
leave
to
lay
before
you
another
evidence
passed
over
in
silence
by
the
gentleman
on
the
other
side
he
took
notice
that
a
resurrection
was
so
extraordinary
a
thing
that
no
human
evidence
could
support
it
i
am
not
sure
that
he
is
not
in
the
right
if
twenty
men
were
to
come
into
england
with
such
a
report
from
a
distant
country
perhaps
they
might
not
find
twenty
more
here
to
believe
their
story
and
i
rather
think
the
gentleman
may
be
in
the
right
because
in
the
present
case
i
see
clearly
that
the
credit
of
the
resurrection
of
christ
was
not
trusted
to
mere
human
evidence
to
what
evidence
it
was
trusted
we
find
by
his
own
declaration
the
spirit
of
truth
which
proceedeth
from
the
father
he
shall
testify
of
me
and
ye
also
speaking
to
his
apostles
shall
bear
witness
because
ye
have
been
with
me
from
the
beginning
john
and
therefore
though
the
apostles
had
conversed
with
him
forty
days
after
his
resurrection
and
had
received
his
commission
to
go
teach
all
nations
yet
he
expressly
forbids
them
entering
upon
the
work
till
they
should
receive
powers
from
above
acts
and
peter
explains
the
evidence
of
the
resurrection
in
this
manner
we
the
apostles
are
his
witnesses
of
these
things
and
so
is
also
the
holy
ghost
whom
god
hath
given
to
them
who
obey
him
acts
now
what
were
the
powers
received
by
the
apostles
where
they
not
the
powers
of
wisdom
and
courage
by
which
they
were
enabled
to
appear
before
rulers
and
princes
in
the
name
of
christ
the
power
of
miracles
even
of
raising
the
dead
to
life
by
which
they
convinced
the
world
that
god
was
with
them
in
what
they
said
and
did
with
respect
to
this
evidence
john
says
if
we
receive
the
witness
of
men
the
witness
of
god
is
greater
i
john
add
to
this
that
the
apostles
had
a
power
to
communicate
these
gifts
to
believers
can
you
wonder
that
men
believed
the
reality
of
those
powers
of
which
they
were
partakers
and
became
conscious
to
themselves
with
respect
to
these
communicated
powers
i
suppose
john
speaks
when
he
says
he
that
believeth
on
the
son
of
god
hath
the
witness
in
himself
i
john
appealing
not
to
an
inward
testimony
of
the
spirit
in
the
sense
of
some
modern
enthusiasts
but
to
the
powers
of
the
spirit
which
believers
received
and
which
were
seen
in
the
effects
that
followed
it
was
objected
that
the
apostles
separated
themselves
to
the
work
of
the
ministry
and
one
went
into
one
country
another
to
another
and
consequently
that
the
belief
of
the
resurrection
was
originally
received
every
where
upon
the
testimony
of
one
witness
i
will
not
examine
this
fact
suppose
it
to
be
so
but
did
this
one
witness
go
alone
when
he
was
attended
with
the
powers
of
heaven
was
not
every
blind
man
restored
to
sight
and
every
lame
man
to
his
feet
a
new
witness
to
the
truth
reported
by
the
first
besides
when
the
people
of
different
countries
came
to
compare
notes
and
found
that
they
had
all
received
the
same
account
of
christ
and
of
his
doctrine
then
surely
the
evidence
of
these
distant
witnesses
thus
united
became
stronger
than
if
they
had
told
their
story
together
for
twelve
men
separately
examined
form
a
much
stronger
proof
for
the
truth
of
any
fact
than
twelve
men
agreeing
together
in
one
story
if
the
same
thing
were
to
happen
in
our
own
time
if
one
or
two
were
to
come
into
england
and
report
that
a
man
was
raised
from
the
dead
and
in
consequence
of
it
teach
nothing
but
that
we
ought
to
love
god
and
our
neighbors
if
to
confirm
their
report
they
should
before
our
eyes
cure
the
blind
the
deaf
the
lame
and
even
raise
the
dead
to
life
if
endued
with
all
these
powers
they
should
live
in
poverty
and
distress
and
patiently
submit
to
all
that
scorn
contempt
and
malice
could
contrive
to
distress
them
and
at
last
sacrifice
even
their
lives
in
justification
of
the
truth
of
their
report
if
upon
inquiry
we
should
find
that
all
the
countries
in
europe
had
received
the
same
account
supported
by
the
same
miraculous
powers
attested
in
like
manner
by
the
sufferings
and
confirmed
by
the
blood
of
the
witnesses
i
would
fain
know
what
any
reasonable
man
would
do
in
this
case
would
he
despise
such
evidence
i
think
he
would
not
and
whoever
thinks
otherwise
must
say
that
a
resurrection
though
in
its
own
nature
possible
is
yet
such
a
thing
in
which
we
ought
not
to
believe
either
god
or
man
judge
have
you
done
sir
b
yes
my
lord
judge
go
on
if
you
have
anything
to
say
in
reply
a
my
lord
i
shall
trouble
you
with
very
little
the
objections
and
answers
under
this
head
i
shall
leave
to
the
judgment
of
the
court
and
beg
leave
only
to
make
an
observation
or
two
upon
the
last
part
of
the
gentleman
argument
and
first
with
respect
to
the
sufferings
of
the
apostles
and
disciples
of
jesus
and
the
argument
drawn
from
thence
for
the
truth
of
their
doctrines
and
assertions
i
beg
leave
to
observe
to
you
that
there
is
not
a
false
religion
or
pretence
in
the
world
but
can
produce
the
same
authority
and
show
many
instances
of
men
who
have
suffered
even
to
death
for
the
truth
of
their
several
professions
if
we
consult
only
modern
story
we
shall
find
papists
suffering
for
popery
protestants
for
their
religion
and
among
protestants
every
sect
has
had
its
martyrs
puritans
quakers
men
in
henry
time
england
saw
both
popish
and
protestant
martyrs
in
queen
reign
the
rage
fell
upon
protestants
in
queen
elizabeth
papists
and
puritans
were
called
sometimes
though
rarely
to
this
trial
in
later
times
sometimes
churchmen
sometimes
dissenters
were
persecuted
what
must
we
say
then
all
these
sufferers
had
not
truth
with
them
and
yet
if
there
be
any
weight
in
this
argument
from
suffering
they
have
all
the
right
to
plead
it
but
i
may
be
told
perhaps
that
men
by
their
sufferings
though
they
do
not
prove
their
doctrines
to
be
true
yet
prove
at
least
their
own
sincerity
as
if
it
were
a
thing
impossible
for
men
to
dissemble
at
the
point
of
death
alas
how
many
instances
are
there
of
men
denying
facts
plainly
proved
asserting
facts
plainly
disproved
even
with
the
rope
around
their
necks
must
all
such
pass
for
innocent
sufferers
sincere
men
if
not
it
must
be
allowed
that
a
man
word
at
the
point
of
death
is
not
always
to
be
relied
on
another
observation
i
would
make
is
with
respect
to
the
evidence
of
the
spirit
on
which
so
much
stress
is
laid
it
has
been
hitherto
insisted
on
that
the
resurrection
was
a
matter
of
fact
and
such
a
fact
as
was
capable
and
proper
to
be
supported
by
the
evidence
of
sense
how
comes
it
about
that
this
evidence
this
which
is
the
proper
evidence
is
given
up
as
insufficient
and
a
new
improper
evidence
introduced
is
it
not
surprising
that
one
great
miracle
should
want
an
hundred
more
to
prove
it
every
miracle
is
itself
an
appeal
to
sense
and
therefore
admits
no
evidence
but
that
of
sense
and
there
is
no
connexion
between
a
miracle
done
this
year
and
last
year
it
does
not
follow
therefore
because
peter
cured
a
lame
man
allowing
the
fact
that
therefore
christ
rose
from
the
dead
but
allowing
the
gentleman
all
he
demands
what
is
to
us
they
who
had
the
witness
within
them
did
perhaps
very
well
to
consult
and
to
take
his
word
but
how
am
i
or
others
who
have
not
this
witness
is
us
the
better
for
it
if
the
first
ages
of
the
church
saw
all
the
wonders
related
by
the
gentleman
and
believed
it
shews
at
least
in
his
opinion
that
this
strong
evidence
was
necessary
to
create
the
belief
he
requires
why
then
does
he
require
this
belief
of
us
who
have
not
this
strong
evidence
judge
very
well
gentlemen
of
the
jury
you
have
heard
the
proofs
and
arguments
on
both
sides
and
it
is
now
your
part
to
give
a
verdict
here
the
gentlemen
whispered
together
and
the
foreman
stood
up
foreman
my
lord
the
case
has
been
long
and
consists
of
several
articles
therefore
the
jury
hope
you
will
give
them
your
directions
judge
no
no
you
are
very
able
to
judge
without
my
help
a
my
lord
pray
consider
you
appointed
this
meeting
and
chose
your
office
and
i
have
gone
through
our
parts
and
have
some
right
on
your
doing
your
part
i
must
join
sir
in
that
request
judge
i
have
often
heard
that
all
honour
has
a
burden
attending
it
but
i
did
not
suspect
it
in
this
office
which
i
conferred
upon
myself
but
since
it
must
be
so
i
will
recollect
and
lay
before
you
as
well
as
i
can
the
substance
of
the
debate
gentlemen
of
the
jury
the
question
before
you
is
whether
the
witnesses
of
the
resurrection
of
christ
are
guilty
of
giving
false
evidence
or
no
two
sorts
of
objections
or
accusations
are
brought
against
them
one
charges
fraud
and
deceit
on
the
transaction
itself
the
other
charges
the
evidence
as
forged
and
insufficient
to
support
the
credit
of
so
extraordinary
an
event
there
are
also
three
periods
of
time
to
be
considered
the
first
takes
in
the
ministry
of
christ
and
ends
at
his
death
during
this
period
the
fraud
is
supposed
to
be
contrived
the
second
reaches
from
his
death
to
his
resurrection
during
this
period
the
fraud
is
supposed
to
be
executed
the
third
begins
from
the
resurrection
and
takes
in
the
whole
ministry
of
the
apostles
and
here
the
evidence
they
gave
the
world
for
this
fact
is
the
main
consideration
as
to
the
first
period
of
time
and
the
fraud
charged
upon
jesus
i
must
observe
to
you
that
this
charge
had
no
evidence
to
support
it
all
the
facts
reported
of
jesus
stand
in
full
contradiction
to
it
to
suppose
as
the
council
did
that
this
fraud
might
possibly
appear
if
we
had
any
jewish
books
written
at
the
time
is
not
to
bring
proof
but
to
wish
for
proof
for
as
it
was
rightly
observed
on
the
other
side
how
does
know
there
were
any
such
books
and
since
they
are
lost
how
does
he
know
what
was
in
them
were
such
books
extant
they
might
probably
prove
beyond
dispute
the
facts
recorded
in
the
gospels
you
were
told
that
the
jews
were
a
very
superstitious
people
much
addicted
to
prophecy
and
particularly
that
they
had
a
strong
expectation
about
the
time
that
christ
appeared
to
have
a
victorious
prince
rise
among
them
this
is
laid
as
the
ground
of
suspicion
and
in
fact
many
imposters
you
are
told
set
up
upon
these
notions
of
the
people
and
thence
it
is
inferred
that
christ
built
his
scheme
upon
the
strength
of
these
popular
prejudices
but
when
this
fact
came
to
be
examined
on
the
other
side
it
appeared
that
christ
was
so
far
from
falling
in
with
these
notions
and
abusing
the
credulity
of
the
people
that
it
was
his
main
point
to
correct
these
prejudices
to
oppose
these
superstitions
and
by
these
very
means
he
fell
into
disgrace
with
his
countrymen
and
suffered
as
one
who
in
their
opinion
destroyed
the
law
and
the
prophets
with
respect
to
temporal
power
so
far
was
he
from
aiming
at
it
that
he
refused
it
when
offered
so
far
from
giving
any
hopes
of
it
to
his
disciples
that
he
invited
men
upon
quite
different
terms
to
take
up
the
cross
and
follow
him
and
it
is
observable
that
after
he
had
foretold
his
death
and
resurrection
he
continued
to
admonish
his
disciples
of
the
evils
they
were
to
suffer
to
tell
them
that
the
world
would
hate
them
and
abuse
them
which
surely
to
common
sense
has
no
appearance
that
he
was
then
contriving
a
cheat
or
encouraging
his
disciples
to
execute
it
but
as
ill
supported
as
this
charge
is
there
was
no
avoiding
it
it
was
necessity
and
not
choice
which
drove
the
gentleman
to
it
for
since
christ
had
foretold
his
resurrection
if
the
whole
was
a
cheat
he
certainly
was
conscious
to
it
and
consequently
the
plot
was
laid
in
his
own
time
and
yet
the
supposing
christ
conscious
to
such
a
fraud
in
these
circumstance
is
contrary
to
all
probability
it
is
very
improbable
that
he
or
any
man
should
without
any
temptation
contrive
a
cheat
to
take
place
after
his
death
and
if
this
could
be
supposed
it
is
highly
improbable
that
he
should
give
publick
notice
of
it
and
thereby
put
all
men
on
their
guard
especially
considering
there
were
only
a
few
women
and
twelve
men
of
low
fortunes
and
mean
education
to
conduct
the
plot
and
the
whole
power
of
the
jews
and
romans
to
oppose
it
seemed
sensible
of
these
difficulties
and
therefore
would
have
varied
the
charge
and
have
made
christ
an
enthusiast
and
his
disciples
only
cheats
this
was
not
properly
moved
and
therefore
not
debated
for
which
reason
i
shall
pass
it
over
with
this
short
observation
that
enthusiasm
is
as
contrary
to
the
whole
character
and
conduct
of
christ
as
even
fraud
is
besides
this
imagination
if
allowed
goes
only
to
christ
own
part
and
leaves
the
charge
of
fraud
in
its
full
extent
upon
the
management
from
the
time
of
his
death
and
therefore
is
of
no
use
unless
the
fraud
afterwards
be
apparent
for
if
there
really
was
a
resurrection
it
will
sufficiently
answer
the
charge
of
enthusiasm
i
pass
on
to
the
second
period
to
consider
what
happened
between
the
death
and
resurrection
of
christ
and
here
it
agreed
that
christ
died
and
was
buried
so
far
then
there
was
no
fraud
for
the
better
understanding
the
charge
here
we
must
recollect
a
material
circumstance
reported
by
one
of
the
evangelists
which
is
this
after
christ
was
buried
the
chief
priests
and
pharisees
came
to
pilate
the
roman
governor
and
informed
him
that
this
deceiver
meaning
jesus
had
in
his
lifetime
foretold
that
he
would
rise
again
after
three
days
that
they
suspected
his
disciples
would
steal
away
the
body
and
pretend
a
resurrection
and
then
the
last
error
would
be
worse
than
the
first
they
therefore
desire
a
guard
to
watch
the
sepulchre
to
prevent
all
fraud
they
had
one
granted
accordingly
they
placed
a
watch
on
the
sepulchre
and
sealed
up
the
stone
at
the
mouth
of
it
what
the
event
of
this
case
was
the
same
writer
tells
us
the
guards
saw
the
stone
removed
by
angels
and
for
fear
they
became
as
dead
men
when
they
came
to
the
city
they
reported
to
the
chief
priests
what
had
happened
a
council
is
called
and
a
resolution
taken
to
bribe
the
soldiers
to
say
that
the
body
was
stolen
while
they
were
asleep
and
the
council
undertook
to
excuse
the
soldiers
to
pilate
for
their
negligence
in
falling
asleep
when
they
were
on
duty
thus
the
fact
stands
in
the
original
record
now
the
council
for
woolston
maintains
that
the
story
reported
by
the
soldiers
after
they
had
been
bribed
by
the
chief
priests
contains
the
true
account
of
this
pretended
resurrection
the
gentleman
was
sensible
of
a
difficulty
in
his
way
to
account
for
the
credit
which
the
jews
gave
to
the
prediction
of
christ
for
if
as
he
pretends
they
knew
him
to
be
an
impostor
what
reason
had
they
to
take
any
notion
of
his
prediction
and
therefore
that
very
caution
in
this
case
betrayed
their
concern
and
shewed
that
they
were
not
satisfied
that
his
pretensions
were
groundless
to
obviate
this
he
says
that
they
had
discovered
before
one
great
cheat
in
the
case
of
lazarus
and
therefore
were
suspicious
of
another
in
this
case
he
was
answered
that
the
discovery
of
a
cheat
in
the
case
before
mentioned
ought
rather
to
have
set
them
at
ease
and
made
them
quite
secure
as
to
the
event
of
the
prediction
in
reply
he
says
that
the
chief
priests
however
satisfied
of
the
cheat
themselves
had
found
that
it
prevailed
among
the
people
and
to
secure
the
people
from
being
further
imposed
on
they
used
the
caution
they
did
this
is
the
substance
of
the
argument
on
both
sides
i
must
observe
to
you
that
this
reasoning
from
the
case
of
lazarus
has
no
foundation
in
history
there
is
no
pretence
for
saying
that
the
jews
in
this
whole
affair
had
any
particular
regard
to
the
raising
of
lazarus
and
if
they
had
any
such
just
suspicion
why
was
it
not
mentioned
at
the
trial
of
christ
there
was
then
an
opportunity
of
opening
the
whole
fraud
and
undeceiving
the
people
the
jews
had
a
plain
law
for
punishing
a
false
prophet
and
what
could
be
a
stronger
conviction
than
such
a
cheat
made
manifest
why
then
was
this
advantage
lost
the
gentleman
builds
this
observation
on
these
words
so
the
last
error
shall
be
worse
than
the
first
but
is
there
here
anything
said
about
lazarus
no
the
words
are
a
proverbial
form
of
speech
and
probably
were
used
without
relation
to
any
particular
case
but
if
a
particular
meaning
must
be
assigned
it
is
more
probable
that
the
words
being
used
to
pilate
contained
a
reason
applicable
to
him
now
pilate
had
been
drawn
in
to
consent
to
the
crucifixion
for
fear
the
jews
should
set
up
jesus
to
be
their
king
in
opposition
to
caesar
therefore
say
the
chief
priests
to
him
if
once
the
people
believe
him
to
be
risen
from
the
dead
the
last
error
will
be
worse
than
the
first
they
will
be
more
inclined
and
encouraged
to
rebel
against
the
romans
than
ever
this
is
a
natural
sense
of
the
words
as
they
are
used
to
move
the
roman
governor
to
allow
them
a
guard
whether
lazarus
were
dead
or
alive
whether
christ
came
to
destroy
the
law
and
the
prophets
or
to
establish
or
confirm
them
was
of
little
moment
to
pilate
it
is
plain
he
was
touched
by
none
of
these
considerations
and
refused
to
be
concerned
in
the
affair
of
christ
till
he
was
alarmed
with
the
suggestions
of
danger
to
the
roman
state
this
was
the
first
fear
that
moved
him
must
not
therefore
the
second
now
suggested
to
him
be
of
the
same
kind
the
next
circumstance
to
be
considered
is
that
of
the
seal
upon
the
stone
of
the
sepulchre
the
council
for
woolston
supposes
an
agreement
between
the
jews
and
disciples
about
setting
this
seal
but
for
this
agreement
there
is
no
evidence
nay
to
suppose
it
contradicts
the
whole
series
of
the
history
as
the
gentleman
on
the
other
side
observed
i
will
not
enter
into
the
particulars
of
this
debate
for
it
is
needless
the
plain
natural
account
given
of
this
matter
shuts
out
all
other
suppositions
observed
to
you
that
the
jews
having
a
guard
set
the
seal
to
prevent
any
combination
among
the
guards
to
deceive
them
which
seems
a
plain
and
satisfactory
account
the
council
for
replies
let
the
use
of
the
seals
be
what
they
will
it
is
plain
they
were
broken
and
if
they
were
used
as
a
check
upon
the
roman
soldiers
then
probably
they
consented
to
the
fraud
and
then
it
is
easily
understood
how
the
body
was
removed
i
must
observe
to
you
here
that
this
suspicion
agrees
neither
with
the
account
given
by
the
evangelist
nor
with
the
story
set
about
by
the
jews
so
that
it
is
utterly
unsupported
by
any
evidence
nor
has
it
any
probability
in
it
for
what
could
move
pilate
and
the
roman
soldiers
to
propagate
such
a
cheat
he
had
crucified
christ
for
no
other
reason
but
for
fear
the
people
would
revolt
from
the
romans
perhaps
too
he
consented
to
place
a
guard
upon
the
sepulchre
to
put
an
end
to
the
people
hope
in
jesus
and
is
it
likely
at
last
that
he
was
consenting
to
a
cheat
to
make
the
people
believe
him
risen
from
the
dead
the
thing
of
all
others
which
he
was
obliged
as
his
apprehensions
were
to
prevent
the
next
circumstance
insisted
on
as
a
proof
of
the
fraud
is
that
jesus
rose
from
the
dead
before
the
time
he
had
appointed
supposes
that
the
disciples
hastened
the
plot
for
fear
of
falling
in
with
multitudes
who
waited
only
for
the
appointed
time
to
be
at
the
sepulchre
and
to
see
with
their
own
eyes
he
was
answered
that
the
disciples
were
not
could
not
be
concerned
or
be
present
at
moving
the
body
that
they
were
dispersed
and
lay
concealed
for
fear
of
the
jews
that
hastening
the
plot
was
of
no
use
for
the
resurrection
happened
whilst
the
guards
were
at
the
sepulchre
who
were
probably
enow
to
prevent
violence
certainly
enow
to
discover
it
if
any
were
used
this
difficulty
then
rests
merely
upon
the
reckoning
of
the
time
christ
died
on
friday
rose
early
on
sunday
the
question
is
whether
this
was
rising
the
third
day
according
to
the
prediction
i
will
refer
the
authorities
made
use
of
in
this
case
to
your
memory
and
add
only
one
observation
to
shew
that
it
was
indeed
the
third
day
according
as
the
people
of
the
country
reckoned
when
christ
talked
with
the
two
disciples
who
knew
him
not
they
gave
him
an
account
of
his
own
crucifixion
and
their
disappointment
and
tell
him
today
is
the
third
day
since
these
things
were
done
now
this
conversation
was
on
the
very
day
of
the
resurrection
and
the
disciples
thought
of
nothing
less
than
answering
an
objection
against
the
resurrection
which
as
yet
they
did
not
believe
they
recount
only
a
matter
of
fact
and
reckon
the
time
according
to
the
usage
of
their
country
and
call
the
day
of
the
resurrection
the
third
day
from
the
crucifixion
which
is
a
plain
evidence
in
what
manner
the
jews
reckoned
in
this
and
like
cases
as
the
objections
in
this
case
are
founded
upon
the
story
reported
by
the
jews
and
the
roman
soldiers
in
his
answer
endeavored
to
shew
from
some
historical
passages
that
the
jews
themselves
did
not
believe
the
story
his
first
argument
was
that
the
jews
never
questioned
the
disciples
for
this
cheat
and
the
share
they
had
in
it
when
they
had
them
in
their
power
and
yet
who
sees
not
that
it
was
very
much
in
their
purpose
so
to
do
to
this
there
is
no
reply
the
second
argument
was
from
the
treatment
paul
had
from
king
agrippa
and
his
saying
to
paul
almost
thou
persuadest
me
to
be
a
christian
a
speech
which
he
reckons
could
not
be
made
by
a
prince
to
one
concerned
in
carrying
out
a
known
cheat
to
this
the
gentleman
replies
that
agrippa
never
did
become
a
christian
and
that
no
great
stress
is
to
be
laid
upon
his
compliance
to
his
prisoner
but
allowing
that
there
was
something
of
humanity
and
civility
in
the
expression
yet
such
civility
could
hardly
be
paid
to
a
known
impostor
there
is
a
propriety
even
in
civility
a
prince
may
be
civil
to
a
rebel
but
he
will
hardly
compliment
him
for
his
loyalty
he
may
be
civil
to
a
poor
sectary
but
if
he
knows
him
to
be
a
cheat
he
will
scarcely
compliment
him
with
hopes
that
he
will
be
of
his
party
the
third
argument
was
from
the
advice
given
by
gamaliel
to
the
council
of
the
jews
to
let
the
apostles
alone
for
fear
they
themselves
should
be
found
to
fight
against
god
a
supposition
which
the
gentleman
thinks
absolutely
inconsistent
with
his
or
the
being
persuaded
that
the
apostles
were
guilty
of
any
fraud
in
managing
the
resurrection
of
christ
the
gentleman
replies
that
gamaliel
advice
respected
only
the
numbers
of
people
deceived
and
was
a
declaration
of
his
opinion
that
it
was
not
prudent
to
come
to
extremities
till
the
people
were
in
a
better
temper
this
deserves
consideration
first
i
observe
that
gamaliel
words
are
express
lest
ye
be
found
to
fight
against
god
which
reason
respects
god
and
not
the
people
and
the
suppostion
is
that
the
hand
of
god
might
possibly
be
in
this
work
a
saying
which
could
not
have
come
from
him
or
have
been
received
by
the
council
if
they
had
believed
the
resurrection
to
have
been
a
cheat
secondly
it
is
remarkable
that
the
miracles
wrought
by
the
apostles
after
the
death
of
christ
those
especially
which
occasioned
the
calling
of
this
council
had
a
much
greater
effect
upon
the
jews
than
even
the
miracles
of
christ
himself
they
held
out
against
all
the
wonders
of
christ
and
were
perpetually
plotting
his
death
not
doubting
but
that
would
put
an
end
to
all
their
trouble
but
when
after
his
death
they
saw
the
same
powers
continue
with
the
apostles
they
saw
no
end
of
the
affair
but
began
to
think
in
earnest
there
might
be
more
in
it
than
they
were
willing
to
believe
and
upon
the
report
made
to
them
of
the
apostle
works
they
make
serious
reflexion
and
doubted
whereunto
this
would
grow
and
though
in
their
anger
and
vexation
of
heart
they
thought
of
desperate
remedies
and
were
for
killing
the
apostles
also
yet
they
hearkened
willing
to
gamaliel
advice
which
at
another
time
might
have
been
dangerous
to
the
adviser
so
that
it
appears
from
the
history
that
the
whole
council
had
the
same
doubt
that
gamaliel
had
that
possibly
the
hand
of
god
might
be
in
this
thing
and
could
the
jews
if
they
had
manifestly
discovered
the
cheat
of
the
resurrection
a
little
time
before
have
entertained
such
a
suspicion
the
last
period
commences
at
the
resurrection
and
takes
in
the
evidence
upon
which
the
credit
of
this
fact
stands
the
council
for
woolston
among
other
difficulties
started
one
which
if
well
grounded
excludes
all
evidence
out
of
this
case
the
resurrection
being
a
thing
out
of
the
course
of
nature
he
thinks
the
testimony
of
nature
held
forth
to
us
in
her
constant
method
of
working
a
stronger
evidence
against
the
possibility
of
a
resurrection
than
any
human
evidence
can
be
for
the
reality
of
one
in
answer
to
this
it
is
said
on
the
other
side
first
that
a
resurrection
is
a
thing
to
be
judged
of
by
mens
senses
and
this
can
not
be
doubted
we
all
know
when
a
man
is
dead
and
should
he
come
to
life
again
we
might
judge
whether
he
was
alive
or
no
by
the
very
same
means
by
which
we
judge
those
about
us
to
be
living
men
secondly
that
the
notion
of
a
resurrection
contradicts
no
one
principle
of
right
reason
interferes
with
no
law
of
nature
and
that
whoever
admits
that
god
gave
man
life
at
first
can
not
possibly
doubt
of
his
power
to
restore
it
when
lost
thirdly
that
appealing
to
the
settled
course
of
nature
is
referring
the
matter
in
dispute
not
to
rules
or
maxims
of
reason
and
true
philosophy
but
to
the
prejudices
and
mistakes
of
men
which
are
various
and
infinite
and
differ
sometimes
according
to
the
climate
men
live
in
because
men
form
a
notion
of
nature
from
what
they
see
and
therefore
in
cold
countries
all
men
judge
it
to
be
according
to
the
course
of
nature
for
water
to
freeze
in
warm
countries
they
judge
it
to
be
unnatural
consequently
that
it
is
not
enough
to
prove
anything
to
be
contrary
to
the
laws
of
nature
to
say
that
it
is
usually
or
constantly
to
our
observation
otherwise
and
therefore
though
men
in
the
ordinary
course
die
and
do
not
rise
again
which
is
certainly
a
prejudice
against
the
belief
of
a
resurrection
yet
is
it
not
an
argument
against
the
possibility
of
a
resurrection
another
objection
was
against
the
reality
of
the
body
of
christ
after
it
came
from
the
grave
these
objections
are
founded
upon
such
passages
as
report
his
appearing
or
disappearing
to
the
eyes
of
his
disciples
at
pleasure
his
coming
in
among
them
when
the
doors
were
shut
his
forbidding
some
to
touch
him
his
inviting
others
to
do
it
his
having
the
very
wounds
whereof
he
died
fresh
and
open
in
his
body
and
the
like
hence
the
council
concluded
that
it
was
no
real
body
which
was
sometimes
visible
sometimes
invisible
sometimes
capable
of
being
touched
sometimes
incapable
on
the
other
side
it
was
answered
that
many
of
these
objections
are
founded
on
a
mistaken
belief
of
the
passages
referred
to
particularly
of
the
passage
in
which
christ
is
thought
to
forbid
mary
magdalene
to
touch
him
of
another
in
which
he
calls
to
thomas
to
examine
his
wounds
and
probably
of
a
third
relating
to
conversation
with
his
disciples
on
the
road
without
being
known
by
them
as
to
other
passages
which
relate
his
appearing
and
disappearing
and
coming
in
when
the
doors
were
shut
it
is
said
that
no
conclusion
can
be
drawn
from
them
against
the
reality
of
christ
body
that
these
things
might
happen
many
ways
and
yet
the
body
be
real
which
is
the
only
point
to
which
the
present
objection
extends
that
there
might
be
in
this
and
probably
was
something
miraculous
but
nothing
more
wonderful
than
what
happened
on
another
occasion
in
his
lifetime
where
the
gentleman
who
makes
the
objection
allows
him
to
have
had
a
real
body
i
mention
these
things
but
briefly
just
to
bring
the
course
of
the
argument
to
your
remembrance
the
next
objection
is
taken
from
hence
that
christ
did
not
appear
publickly
to
the
people
and
particularly
to
the
chief
priests
and
rulers
of
the
jews
it
is
said
that
his
commission
related
to
them
in
an
especial
manner
and
that
it
appears
strange
that
the
main
proof
of
his
mission
the
resurrection
should
not
be
laid
before
them
but
that
witnesses
should
be
picked
and
culled
to
see
this
mighty
wonder
this
is
the
force
of
the
objection
to
which
it
is
answered
first
that
the
particular
commission
to
the
jews
expired
at
the
death
of
christ
and
therefore
the
jews
had
on
this
account
no
claim
for
any
particular
evidence
and
it
is
insisted
that
christ
before
his
death
declared
the
jews
should
not
see
him
till
they
were
better
disposed
to
receive
him
secondly
that
as
the
whole
world
had
a
concern
in
the
resurrection
of
christ
it
was
necessary
to
prepare
a
proper
evidence
for
the
whole
world
which
was
not
to
be
done
by
any
particular
satisfaction
given
to
the
people
of
the
jews
or
their
rulers
thirdly
that
as
to
the
chosen
witnesses
it
is
a
mistake
to
think
that
they
were
chosen
as
the
only
persons
to
see
christ
after
the
resurrection
and
that
in
truth
many
others
did
see
him
but
that
the
witnesses
were
chosen
as
proper
persons
to
bear
testimony
to
all
people
an
office
to
which
many
others
who
did
see
christ
were
not
particularly
commissioned
that
making
choice
of
proper
and
credible
witnesses
was
so
far
from
being
a
ground
of
just
suspicion
that
it
is
in
all
cases
the
most
proper
way
to
exclude
the
next
objection
is
pointed
against
the
evidence
of
the
angels
and
the
women
it
is
said
that
history
reports
that
the
women
saw
young
men
at
the
sepulchre
that
they
were
advanced
into
angels
merely
through
the
fear
and
superstition
of
the
women
that
at
the
best
this
is
but
a
story
of
an
apparition
a
thing
in
times
of
ignorance
much
talked
of
but
in
the
days
of
knowledge
never
heard
of
in
answer
to
this
it
is
said
that
the
angels
are
not
properly
reckoned
among
the
witnesses
of
the
resurrection
they
were
not
in
the
number
of
the
chosen
witnesses
or
sent
to
bear
testimony
in
the
world
that
they
were
indeed
ministers
of
god
appointed
to
attend
the
resurrection
that
god
has
such
ministers
can
not
be
reasonably
doubted
nor
can
it
be
objected
that
they
were
improperly
employed
or
below
their
dignity
in
attending
on
the
resurrection
of
christ
that
we
believe
them
to
be
angels
not
on
the
report
of
the
women
but
upon
the
credit
of
the
evangelist
who
affirms
it
that
what
is
said
of
apparitions
on
this
occasion
may
pass
for
wit
and
ridicule
but
yields
not
reason
or
argument
the
objection
to
the
women
was
i
think
only
that
they
were
women
which
was
strengthened
by
calling
them
silly
women
it
was
answered
that
women
have
eyes
and
ears
as
well
as
men
and
can
tell
what
they
see
and
hear
and
it
happened
in
this
case
that
the
women
were
so
far
from
being
credulous
that
they
believed
not
the
angels
and
hardly
believed
their
own
report
however
that
the
women
are
none
of
the
chosen
witnesses
and
if
they
were
the
evidence
of
the
men
can
not
be
set
aside
because
women
saw
what
they
this
is
the
substance
of
the
objections
and
the
answers
the
council
for
the
apostles
insisted
further
that
they
gave
the
greatest
assurance
to
the
world
that
possibly
could
be
given
of
their
sincere
dealing
by
suffering
all
kinds
of
hardship
and
at
last
death
itself
in
confirmation
of
the
truth
of
their
evidence
the
council
for
woolston
in
reply
to
this
told
you
that
all
religions
whether
true
or
false
had
had
their
martyrs
that
no
opinion
however
absurd
can
be
named
but
some
have
been
content
to
die
for
it
and
then
concluded
that
suffering
is
no
evidence
of
the
truth
of
the
opinions
for
which
men
suffer
to
clear
this
matter
to
you
i
must
observe
how
this
case
stands
you
have
heard
often
in
the
course
of
this
argument
that
the
apostles
were
witnesses
chosen
to
bear
testimony
to
the
resurrection
and
for
that
reason
had
the
fullest
evidence
themselves
of
the
truth
of
it
not
merely
by
seeing
christ
once
or
twice
after
his
death
but
by
frequent
conversations
with
him
for
forty
days
together
before
his
ascension
that
this
was
their
proper
business
appears
plainly
from
history
where
we
find
that
to
ordain
an
apostle
was
the
same
thing
as
ordaining
one
to
be
a
witness
of
the
resurrection
acts
if
you
look
further
to
the
preaching
of
the
apostles
you
will
find
this
was
the
great
article
insisted
on
acts
and
paul
knew
the
weight
of
this
article
and
the
necessity
of
teaching
it
when
he
said
if
christ
be
not
risen
our
faith
is
vain
you
see
then
that
the
thing
which
the
apostles
testified
and
the
thing
for
which
they
suffered
was
the
truth
of
the
resurrection
which
is
a
mere
matter
of
fact
consider
now
how
the
objection
stands
the
council
for
woolston
tells
you
that
it
is
common
for
men
to
die
for
false
opinions
and
he
tells
you
nothing
but
the
truth
but
even
in
those
cases
their
suffering
is
an
evidence
of
their
sincerity
and
it
would
be
very
hard
to
charge
men
who
die
for
the
doctrine
they
profess
with
insincerity
in
the
profession
mistaken
they
may
be
but
every
mistaken
man
is
not
a
cheat
now
if
you
will
allow
the
suffering
of
the
apostles
to
prove
their
sincerity
which
you
can
not
well
disallow
and
consider
that
they
died
for
the
truth
of
a
matter
of
fact
which
they
had
seen
themselves
you
will
perceive
how
strong
the
evidence
is
in
this
case
in
doctrines
and
matters
of
opinion
men
mistake
perpetually
and
it
is
no
reason
for
me
to
take
up
with
another
man
opinion
because
i
am
persuaded
he
is
sincere
in
it
but
when
a
man
reports
to
me
an
uncommon
fact
yet
such
an
one
as
in
its
own
nature
is
a
plain
object
of
sense
if
i
believe
him
not
it
is
not
because
i
suspect
his
eyes
or
his
sense
of
feeling
but
merely
because
i
suspect
his
sincerity
for
if
i
was
to
see
the
same
thing
myself
i
should
believe
myself
and
therefore
my
suspicion
does
not
arise
from
the
inability
of
human
senses
to
judge
in
the
case
but
from
a
doubt
of
the
sincerity
of
the
reporter
in
such
cases
therefore
there
wants
nothing
to
be
proved
but
only
the
sincerity
of
the
reporter
and
since
voluntary
sufferings
for
the
truth
is
at
least
a
proof
of
sincerity
the
sufferings
of
the
apostles
for
the
truth
of
the
resurrection
is
a
full
and
unexceptionable
proof
the
council
for
woolston
was
sensible
of
this
difference
and
therefore
he
added
that
there
are
many
instances
of
men
suffering
and
dying
in
an
obstinate
denial
of
the
truth
of
facts
plainly
proved
this
observation
is
also
true
i
remember
a
story
of
a
man
who
endured
with
great
constancy
all
the
tortures
of
the
rack
denying
the
fact
with
which
he
was
charged
when
he
was
asked
afterwards
how
he
could
hold
out
against
all
the
tortures
he
answered
i
had
painted
a
gallows
upon
the
toe
of
my
shoe
and
when
the
rack
stretched
me
i
looked
on
the
gallows
and
bore
the
pain
to
save
my
life
this
man
denied
a
plain
fact
under
great
torture
but
you
see
a
reason
for
it
in
other
cases
when
criminals
persist
in
denying
their
crimes
they
often
do
it
and
there
is
a
reason
to
suspect
they
do
it
always
in
hopes
of
a
pardon
or
reprieve
but
what
are
these
instances
to
the
present
purpose
all
these
men
suffer
against
their
will
and
for
their
crimes
and
their
obstinacy
is
built
on
the
hope
of
escaping
by
moving
the
compassion
of
the
government
can
the
gentleman
give
any
instances
of
persons
who
died
willingly
in
attestation
of
a
false
fact
we
have
had
in
england
some
weak
enough
to
die
for
the
pope
supremacy
but
do
you
think
a
man
could
be
found
to
die
in
proof
of
the
pope
being
actually
on
the
throne
of
england
now
the
apostles
died
in
asserting
the
truth
of
resurrection
it
was
always
in
their
power
to
quit
their
evidence
and
save
their
lives
even
their
bitterest
enemies
the
jews
required
no
more
of
them
than
to
be
silent
acts
others
have
denied
facts
or
asserted
facts
in
hopes
of
saving
their
lives
when
they
were
under
sentence
of
death
but
these
men
attested
a
fact
at
the
expence
of
their
lives
which
they
might
have
saved
by
denying
the
truth
so
that
between
criminals
dying
and
denying
plain
facts
and
the
apostles
dying
for
their
testimony
there
is
this
material
difference
criminals
deny
the
truth
in
hopes
of
saving
their
lives
the
apostles
willingly
parted
with
their
lives
rather
than
deny
the
truth
we
are
come
now
to
the
last
and
indeed
the
most
weighty
consideration
the
council
for
the
apostles
having
in
the
course
of
the
argument
allowed
that
more
evidence
is
required
to
support
the
credit
of
the
resurrection
it
being
a
very
extraordinary
event
than
is
necessary
in
common
cases
in
the
latter
part
of
his
defence
sets
forth
the
extraordinary
evidence
upon
which
this
fact
stands
that
is
the
evidence
of
the
spirit
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
power
which
was
given
to
the
apostles
to
enable
them
to
confirm
their
testimony
by
signs
and
wonders
and
mighty
works
this
part
of
the
argument
was
well
argued
by
the
gentleman
and
i
need
not
repeat
all
he
said
the
council
for
woolston
in
his
reply
made
two
objections
to
this
evidence
the
first
was
this
that
the
resurrection
having
all
along
been
pleaded
to
be
a
matter
of
fact
and
an
object
of
sense
to
recur
to
miracles
for
the
proof
of
it
is
to
take
it
out
of
its
proper
evidence
the
evidence
of
sense
and
to
rest
it
upon
a
proof
which
can
not
be
applied
to
it
for
seeing
one
miracle
he
says
is
no
evidence
that
another
miracle
was
wrought
before
it
as
healing
a
sick
man
is
no
evidence
that
a
dead
man
was
raised
to
life
to
clear
this
difficulty
you
must
consider
by
what
train
of
reasoning
miracles
come
to
be
proofs
in
any
case
a
miracle
of
itself
proves
nothing
unless
this
only
that
there
is
a
cause
equal
to
the
producing
the
effect
we
see
suppose
you
should
see
a
man
raise
one
from
the
dead
and
he
should
go
away
and
say
nothing
to
you
you
would
not
find
that
any
fact
or
any
proposition
was
proved
or
disproved
by
this
miracle
but
should
he
declare
to
you
in
the
name
of
him
by
whose
power
the
miracle
was
wrought
that
was
unlawful
you
would
then
be
possessed
of
a
proof
against
but
how
not
because
the
miracle
proves
anything
as
to
the
point
itself
but
because
the
man
declaration
is
authorised
by
him
who
wrought
the
miracle
in
confirmation
of
his
doctrine
and
therefore
miracles
are
directly
a
proof
of
the
authority
of
persons
and
not
of
the
truth
of
things
to
apply
this
to
the
present
case
if
the
apostles
had
wrought
miracles
and
said
nothing
of
the
resurrection
the
miracles
would
have
proved
nothing
about
the
resurrection
one
way
or
another
but
when
as
they
attested
the
truth
of
the
resurrection
and
wrought
miracles
to
confirm
their
authority
the
miracles
did
not
directly
prove
the
resurrection
but
they
confirmed
and
established
beyond
all
suspicion
the
proper
evidence
the
evidence
of
so
that
here
is
no
change
of
the
evidence
from
proper
to
improper
the
fact
still
rests
upon
the
evidence
of
sense
confirmed
and
strengthened
by
the
authority
of
the
spirit
if
a
witness
calls
in
his
neighbors
to
attest
his
veracity
they
prove
nothing
as
to
the
fact
in
question
but
only
confirm
the
evidence
of
the
witness
the
case
here
is
the
same
though
between
the
authorities
brought
in
confirmation
of
the
evidence
there
is
no
comparison
the
second
objection
was
that
this
evidence
however
good
it
may
be
in
its
kind
is
yet
nothing
to
us
it
was
well
the
gentleman
says
for
those
who
had
it
but
what
is
that
to
us
who
have
it
not
to
adjust
this
difficulty
i
must
observe
to
you
that
the
evidence
now
under
consideration
was
not
a
private
evidence
of
the
spirit
or
any
inward
light
like
to
that
which
the
quakers
in
our
time
pretend
to
but
an
evidence
appearing
in
the
manifest
and
visible
works
of
the
spirit
and
this
evidence
was
capable
of
being
transmitted
and
actually
has
been
transmitted
to
us
upon
unquestionable
authority
and
to
allow
the
evidence
to
have
been
good
in
the
first
ages
and
not
in
this
seems
to
be
to
be
a
contradiction
to
the
rules
of
reasoning
for
if
we
see
enough
to
judge
that
the
first
ages
had
reason
to
believe
we
must
needs
see
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
reasonable
for
us
also
to
believe
as
the
present
question
only
relates
to
the
nature
of
the
evidence
it
was
not
necessary
to
produce
from
history
the
instances
to
shew
in
how
plentiful
a
manner
this
evidence
was
granted
to
the
church
whoever
wants
this
satisfaction
may
easily
have
it
gentlemen
of
the
jury
i
have
laid
before
you
the
substance
of
what
has
been
said
on
both
sides
you
are
now
to
consider
of
it
and
to
give
your
verdict
the
jury
consulted
together
and
the
foreman
rose
up
foreman
my
lord
we
are
ready
to
give
our
verdict
judge
are
you
all
agreed
jury
yes
judge
who
shall
speak
for
you
jury
our
foreman
judge
what
say
you
are
the
apostles
guilty
of
giving
false
evidence
in
the
case
of
the
resurrection
of
jesus
or
not
guilty
foreman
not
guilty
judge
very
well
and
now
gentlemen
i
resign
my
commission
and
am
your
humble
servant
the
company
rose
up
and
were
beginning
to
pay
their
compliments
to
the
judge
and
the
council
but
were
interrupted
by
a
gentleman
who
went
up
to
the
judge
and
offered
him
a
fee
what
this
says
the
judge
a
fee
sir
said
the
gentleman
a
fee
to
a
judge
is
a
bribe
said
the
judge
true
sir
said
the
gentleman
but
you
have
resigned
your
commission
and
will
not
be
the
first
judge
who
has
come
from
the
bench
without
any
diminution
of
honour
now
lazarus
case
is
to
come
on
next
and
this
fee
is
to
retain
you
on
his
side
there
followed
a
confused
noise
of
all
speaking
together
to
persuade
the
judge
to
take
the
fee
but
as
the
trial
had
lasted
longer
than
i
expected
and
i
had
lapsed
the
time
of
an
appointment
for
business
i
was
forced
to
slip
away
and
whether
the
judge
was
prevailed
on
to
undertake
the
cause
of
lazarus
or
no
i
can
not
say
finis
