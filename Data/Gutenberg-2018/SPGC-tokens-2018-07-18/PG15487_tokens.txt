chapter

introduction
it
is
well
to
remind
ourselves
from
time
to
time
that
ethics
is
but
another
word
for
righteousness
that
for
which
many
men
and
women
of
every
generation
have
hungered
and
thirsted
and
without
which
life
becomes
meaningless
certain
forms
of
personal
righteousness
have
become
to
a
majority
of
the
community
almost
automatic
it
is
as
easy
for
most
of
us
to
keep
from
stealing
our
dinners
as
it
is
to
digest
them
and
there
is
quite
as
much
voluntary
morality
involved
in
one
process
as
in
the
other
to
steal
would
be
for
us
to
fall
sadly
below
the
standard
of
habit
and
expectation
which
makes
virtue
easy
in
the
same
way
we
have
been
carefully
reared
to
a
sense
of
family
obligation
to
be
kindly
and
considerate
to
the
members
of
our
own
households
and
to
feel
responsible
for
their
as
the
rules
of
conduct
have
become
established
in
regard
to
our
and
our
families
so
they
have
been
in
regard
to
limited
circles
of
friends
if
the
fulfilment
of
these
claims
were
all
that
a
righteous
life
required
the
hunger
and
thirst
would
be
stilled
for
many
good
men
and
women
and
the
clew
of
right
living
would
lie
easily
in
their
hands
but
we
all
know
that
each
generation
has
its
own
test
the
contemporaneous
and
current
standard
by
which
alone
it
can
adequately
judge
of
its
own
moral
achievements
and
that
it
may
not
legitimately
use
a
previous
and
less
vigorous
test
the
advanced
test
must
indeed
include
that
which
has
already
been
attained
but
if
it
includes
no
more
we
shall
fail
to
go
forward
thinking
complacently
that
we
have
arrived
when
in
reality
we
have
not
yet
started
to
attain
individual
morality
in
an
age
demanding
social
morality
to
pride
one
self
on
the
results
of
personal
effort
when
the
time
demands
social
adjustment
is
utterly
to
fail
to
apprehend
the
situation
it
is
perhaps
significant
that
a
german
critic
has
of
late
reminded
us
that
the
one
test
which
the
most
authoritative
and
dramatic
portrayal
of
the
day
of
judgment
offers
is
the
social
test
the
stern
questions
are
not
in
regard
to
personal
and
family
relations
but
did
ye
visit
the
poor
the
criminal
the
sick
and
did
ye
feed
the
hungry
all
about
us
are
men
and
women
who
have
become
unhappy
in
regard
to
their
attitude
toward
the
social
order
itself
toward
the
dreary
round
of
uninteresting
work
the
pleasures
narrowed
down
to
those
of
appetite
the
declining
consciousness
of
brain
power
and
the
lack
of
mental
food
which
characterizes
the
lot
of
the
large
proportion
of
their
these
men
and
women
have
caught
a
moral
challenge
raised
by
the
exigencies
of
contemporaneous
life
some
are
bewildered
others
who
are
denied
the
relief
which
sturdy
action
brings
are
even
seeking
an
escape
but
all
are
increasingly
anxious
concerning
their
actual
relations
to
the
basic
organization
of
society
the
test
which
they
would
apply
to
their
conduct
is
a
social
test
they
fail
to
be
content
with
the
fulfilment
of
their
family
and
personal
obligations
and
find
themselves
striving
to
respond
to
a
new
demand
involving
a
social
obligation
they
have
become
conscious
of
another
requirement
and
the
contribution
they
would
make
is
toward
a
code
of
social
ethics
the
conception
of
life
which
they
hold
has
not
yet
expressed
itself
in
social
changes
or
legal
enactment
but
rather
in
a
mental
attitude
of
maladjustment
and
in
a
sense
of
divergence
between
their
consciences
and
their
conduct
they
desire
both
a
clearer
definition
of
the
code
of
morality
adapted
to
present
day
demands
and
a
part
in
its
fulfilment
both
a
creed
and
a
practice
of
social
morality
in
the
perplexity
of
this
intricate
situation
at
least
one
thing
is
becoming
clear
if
the
latter
day
moral
ideal
is
in
reality
that
of
a
social
morality
it
is
inevitable
that
those
who
desire
it
must
be
brought
in
contact
with
the
moral
experiences
of
the
many
in
order
to
procure
an
adequate
social
motive
these
men
and
women
have
realized
this
and
have
disclosed
the
fact
in
their
eagerness
for
a
wider
acquaintance
with
and
participation
in
the
life
about
them
they
believe
that
experience
gives
the
easy
and
trustworthy
impulse
toward
right
action
in
the
broad
as
well
as
in
the
narrow
relations
we
may
indeed
imagine
many
of
them
saying
cast
our
experiences
in
a
larger
mould
if
our
lives
are
to
be
animated
by
the
larger
social
aims
we
have
met
the
obligations
of
our
family
life
not
because
we
had
made
resolutions
to
that
end
but
spontaneously
because
of
a
common
fund
of
memories
and
affections
from
which
the
obligation
naturally
develops
and
we
see
no
other
way
in
which
to
prepare
ourselves
for
the
larger
social
duties
such
a
demand
is
reasonable
for
by
our
daily
experience
we
have
discovered
that
we
can
not
mechanically
hold
up
a
moral
standard
then
jump
at
it
in
rare
moments
of
exhilaration
when
we
have
the
strength
for
it
but
that
even
as
the
ideal
itself
must
be
a
rational
development
of
life
so
the
strength
to
attain
it
must
be
secured
from
interest
in
life
itself
we
slowly
learn
that
life
consists
of
processes
as
well
as
results
and
that
failure
may
come
quite
as
easily
from
ignoring
the
adequacy
of
one
method
as
from
selfish
or
ignoble
aims
we
are
thus
brought
to
a
conception
of
democracy
not
merely
as
a
sentiment
which
desires
the
of
all
men
nor
yet
as
a
creed
which
believes
in
the
essential
dignity
and
equality
of
all
men
but
as
that
which
affords
a
rule
of
living
as
well
as
a
test
of
faith
we
are
learning
that
a
standard
of
social
ethics
is
not
attained
by
travelling
a
sequestered
byway
but
by
mixing
on
the
thronged
and
common
road
where
all
must
turn
out
for
one
another
and
at
least
see
the
size
of
one
another
burdens
to
follow
the
path
of
social
morality
results
perforce
in
the
temper
if
not
the
practice
of
the
democratic
spirit
for
it
implies
that
diversified
human
experience
and
resultant
sympathy
which
are
the
foundation
and
guarantee
of
democracy
there
are
many
indications
that
this
conception
of
democracy
is
growing
among
us
we
have
come
to
have
an
enormous
interest
in
human
life
as
such
accompanied
by
confidence
in
its
essential
soundness
we
do
not
believe
that
genuine
experience
can
lead
us
astray
any
more
than
scientific
data
can
we
realize
too
that
social
perspective
and
sanity
of
judgment
come
only
from
contact
with
social
experience
that
such
contact
is
the
surest
corrective
of
opinions
concerning
the
social
order
and
concerning
efforts
however
humble
for
its
improvement
indeed
it
is
a
consciousness
of
the
illuminating
and
dynamic
value
of
this
wider
and
more
thorough
human
experience
which
explains
in
no
small
degree
that
new
curiosity
regarding
human
life
which
has
more
of
a
moral
basis
than
an
intellectual
one
the
newspapers
in
a
frank
reflection
of
popular
demand
exhibit
an
omniverous
curiosity
equally
insistent
upon
the
trivial
and
the
important
they
are
perhaps
the
most
obvious
manifestations
of
that
desire
to
know
that
what
is
this
and
why
do
you
do
that
of
the
child
the
first
dawn
of
the
social
consciousness
takes
this
form
as
the
dawning
intelligence
of
the
child
takes
the
form
of
constant
question
and
insatiate
curiosity
literature
too
portrays
an
equally
absorbing
though
better
adjusted
desire
to
know
all
kinds
of
life
the
popular
books
are
the
novels
dealing
with
life
under
all
possible
conditions
and
they
are
widely
read
not
only
because
they
are
entertaining
but
also
because
they
in
a
measure
satisfy
an
unformulated
belief
that
to
see
farther
to
know
all
sorts
of
men
in
an
indefinite
way
is
a
preparation
for
better
social
adjustment
for
the
remedying
of
social
ills
doubtless
one
under
the
conviction
of
sin
in
regard
to
social
ills
finds
a
vague
consolation
in
reading
about
the
lives
of
the
poor
and
derives
a
sense
of
complicity
in
doing
good
he
likes
to
feel
that
he
knows
about
social
wrongs
even
if
he
does
not
remedy
them
and
in
a
very
genuine
sense
there
is
a
foundation
for
this
belief
partly
through
this
wide
reading
of
human
life
we
find
in
ourselves
a
new
affinity
for
all
men
which
probably
never
existed
in
the
world
before
evil
itself
does
not
shock
us
as
it
once
did
and
we
count
only
that
man
merciful
in
whom
we
recognize
an
understanding
of
the
criminal
we
have
learned
as
common
knowledge
that
much
of
the
insensibility
and
hardness
of
the
world
is
due
to
the
lack
of
imagination
which
prevents
a
realization
of
the
experiences
of
other
people
already
there
is
a
conviction
that
we
are
under
a
moral
obligation
in
choosing
our
experiences
since
the
result
of
those
experiences
must
ultimately
determine
our
understanding
of
life
we
know
instinctively
that
if
we
grow
contemptuous
of
our
fellows
and
consciously
limit
our
intercourse
to
certain
kinds
of
people
whom
we
have
previously
decided
to
respect
we
not
only
tremendously
circumscribe
our
range
of
life
but
limit
the
scope
of
our
ethics
we
can
recall
among
the
selfish
people
of
our
acquaintance
at
least
one
common
characteristic
the
conviction
that
they
are
different
from
other
men
and
women
that
they
need
peculiar
consideration
because
they
are
more
sensitive
or
more
refined
such
people
refuse
to
be
bound
by
any
relation
save
the
personally
luxurious
ones
of
love
and
admiration
or
the
identity
of
political
opinion
or
religious
creed
we
have
learned
to
recognize
them
as
selfish
although
we
blame
them
not
for
the
will
which
chooses
to
be
selfish
but
for
a
narrowness
of
interest
which
deliberately
selects
its
experience
within
a
limited
sphere
and
we
say
that
they
illustrate
the
danger
of
concentrating
the
mind
on
narrow
and
unprogressive
issues
we
know
at
last
that
we
can
only
discover
truth
by
a
rational
and
democratic
interest
in
life
and
to
give
truth
complete
social
expression
is
the
endeavor
upon
which
we
are
entering
thus
the
identification
with
the
common
lot
which
is
the
essential
idea
of
democracy
becomes
the
source
and
expression
of
social
ethics
it
is
as
though
we
thirsted
to
drink
at
the
great
wells
of
human
experience
because
we
knew
that
a
daintier
or
less
potent
draught
would
not
carry
us
to
the
end
of
the
journey
going
forward
as
we
must
in
the
heat
and
jostle
of
the
crowd
the
six
following
chapters
are
studies
of
various
types
and
groups
who
are
being
impelled
by
the
newer
conception
of
democracy
to
an
acceptance
of
social
obligations
involving
in
each
instance
a
new
line
of
conduct
no
attempt
is
made
to
reach
a
conclusion
nor
to
offer
advice
beyond
the
assumption
that
the
cure
for
the
ills
of
democracy
is
more
democracy
but
the
quite
result
of
the
studies
would
seem
to
indicate
that
while
the
strain
and
perplexity
of
the
situation
is
felt
most
keenly
by
the
educated
and
members
of
the
community
the
tentative
and
actual
attempts
at
adjustment
are
largely
coming
through
those
who
are
simpler
and
less
analytical
chapter
ii
charitable
effort
all
those
hints
and
glimpses
of
a
larger
and
more
satisfying
democracy
which
literature
and
our
own
hopes
supply
have
a
tendency
to
slip
away
from
us
and
to
leave
us
sadly
unguided
and
perplexed
when
we
attempt
to
act
upon
them
our
conceptions
of
morality
as
all
our
other
ideas
pass
through
a
course
of
development
the
difficulty
comes
in
adjusting
our
conduct
which
has
become
hardened
into
customs
and
habits
to
these
changing
moral
conceptions
when
this
adjustment
is
not
made
we
suffer
from
the
strain
and
indecision
of
believing
one
hypothesis
and
acting
upon
another
probably
there
is
no
relation
in
life
which
our
democracy
is
changing
more
rapidly
than
the
charitable
relation
that
relation
which
obtains
between
benefactor
and
beneficiary
at
the
same
time
there
is
no
point
of
contact
in
our
modern
experience
which
reveals
so
clearly
the
lack
of
that
equality
which
democracy
implies
we
have
reached
the
moment
when
democracy
has
made
such
inroads
upon
this
relationship
that
the
complacency
of
the
charitable
man
is
gone
forever
while
at
the
same
time
the
very
need
and
existence
of
charity
denies
us
the
consolation
and
freedom
which
democracy
will
at
last
give
it
is
quite
obvious
that
the
ethics
of
none
of
us
are
clearly
defined
and
we
are
continually
obliged
to
act
in
circles
of
habit
based
upon
convictions
which
we
no
longer
hold
thus
our
estimate
of
the
effect
of
environment
and
social
conditions
has
doubtless
shifted
faster
than
our
methods
of
administrating
charity
have
changed
formerly
when
it
was
believed
that
poverty
was
synonymous
with
vice
and
laziness
and
that
the
prosperous
man
was
the
righteous
man
charity
was
administered
harshly
with
a
good
conscience
for
the
charitable
agent
really
blamed
the
individual
for
his
poverty
and
the
very
fact
of
his
own
superior
prosperity
gave
him
a
certain
consciousness
of
superior
morality
we
have
learned
since
that
time
to
measure
by
other
standards
and
have
ceased
to
accord
to
the
capacity
exclusive
respect
while
it
is
still
rewarded
out
of
all
proportion
to
any
other
its
possession
is
by
no
means
assumed
to
imply
the
possession
of
the
highest
moral
qualities
we
have
learned
to
judge
men
by
their
social
virtues
as
well
as
by
their
business
capacity
by
their
devotion
to
intellectual
and
disinterested
aims
and
by
their
public
spirit
and
we
naturally
resent
being
obliged
to
judge
poor
people
so
solely
upon
the
industrial
side
our
democratic
instinct
instantly
takes
alarm
it
is
largely
in
this
modern
tendency
to
judge
all
men
by
one
democratic
standard
while
the
old
charitable
attitude
commonly
allowed
the
use
of
two
standards
that
much
of
the
difficulty
adheres
we
know
that
unceasing
bodily
toil
becomes
wearing
and
brutalizing
and
our
position
is
totally
untenable
if
we
judge
large
numbers
of
our
fellows
solely
upon
their
success
in
maintaining
it
the
daintily
clad
charitable
visitor
who
steps
into
the
little
house
made
untidy
by
the
vigorous
efforts
of
her
hostess
the
washerwoman
is
no
longer
sure
of
her
superiority
to
the
latter
she
recognizes
that
her
hostess
after
all
represents
social
value
and
industrial
use
as
over
against
her
own
parasitic
cleanliness
and
a
social
standing
attained
only
through
status
the
only
families
who
apply
for
aid
to
the
charitable
agencies
are
those
who
have
come
to
grief
on
the
industrial
side
it
may
be
through
sickness
through
loss
of
work
or
for
other
guiltless
and
inevitable
reasons
but
the
fact
remains
that
they
are
industrially
ailing
and
must
be
bolstered
and
helped
into
industrial
health
the
charity
visitor
let
us
assume
is
a
young
college
woman
and
when
she
visits
the
family
assigned
to
her
she
is
often
embarrassed
to
find
herself
obliged
to
lay
all
the
stress
of
her
teaching
and
advice
upon
the
industrial
virtues
and
to
treat
the
members
of
the
family
almost
exclusively
as
factors
in
the
industrial
system
she
insists
that
they
must
work
and
be
that
the
most
dangerous
of
all
situations
is
idleness
that
seeking
one
own
pleasure
while
ignoring
claims
and
responsibilities
is
the
most
ignoble
of
actions
the
members
of
her
assigned
family
may
have
other
charms
and
virtues
they
may
possibly
be
kind
and
considerate
of
each
other
generous
to
their
friends
but
it
is
her
business
to
stick
to
the
industrial
side
as
she
daily
holds
up
these
standards
it
often
occurs
to
the
mind
of
the
sensitive
visitor
whose
conscience
has
been
made
tender
by
much
talk
of
brotherhood
and
equality
that
she
has
no
right
to
say
these
things
that
her
untrained
hands
are
no
more
fitted
to
cope
with
actual
conditions
than
those
of
her
family
the
grandmother
of
the
charity
visitor
could
have
done
the
industrial
preaching
very
well
because
she
did
have
the
industrial
virtues
and
housewifely
training
in
a
generation
our
experiences
have
changed
and
our
views
with
them
but
we
still
keep
on
in
the
old
methods
which
could
be
applied
when
our
consciences
were
in
line
with
them
but
which
are
daily
becoming
more
difficult
as
we
divide
up
into
people
who
work
with
their
hands
and
those
who
do
not
the
charity
visitor
belonging
to
the
latter
class
is
perplexed
by
recognitions
and
suggestions
which
the
situation
forces
upon
her
our
democracy
has
taught
us
to
apply
our
moral
teaching
all
around
and
the
moralist
is
rapidly
becoming
so
sensitive
that
when
his
life
does
not
exemplify
his
ethical
convictions
he
finds
it
difficult
to
preach
added
to
this
is
a
consciousness
in
the
mind
of
the
visitor
of
a
genuine
misunderstanding
of
her
motives
by
the
recipients
of
her
charity
and
by
their
neighbors
let
us
take
a
neighborhood
of
poor
people
and
test
their
ethical
standards
by
those
of
the
charity
visitor
who
comes
with
the
best
desire
in
the
world
to
help
them
out
of
their
distress
a
most
striking
incongruity
at
once
apparent
is
the
difference
between
the
emotional
kindness
with
which
relief
is
given
by
one
poor
neighbor
to
another
poor
neighbor
and
the
guarded
care
with
which
relief
is
given
by
a
charity
visitor
to
a
charity
recipient
the
neighborhood
mind
is
at
once
confronted
not
only
by
the
difference
of
method
but
by
an
absolute
clashing
of
two
ethical
standards
a
very
little
familiarity
with
the
poor
districts
of
any
city
is
sufficient
to
show
how
primitive
and
genuine
are
the
neighborly
relations
there
is
the
greatest
willingness
to
lend
or
borrow
anything
and
all
the
residents
of
the
given
tenement
know
the
most
intimate
family
affairs
of
all
the
others
the
fact
that
the
economic
condition
of
all
alike
is
on
a
most
precarious
level
makes
the
ready
outflow
of
sympathy
and
material
assistance
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
there
are
numberless
instances
of
quite
unknown
in
the
circles
where
greater
economic
advantages
make
that
kind
of
intimate
knowledge
of
one
neighbors
impossible
an
irish
family
in
which
the
man
has
lost
his
place
and
the
woman
is
struggling
to
eke
out
the
scanty
savings
by
day
work
will
take
in
the
widow
and
her
five
children
who
have
been
turned
into
the
street
without
a
reflection
upon
the
physical
discomforts
involved
the
most
maligned
landlady
who
lives
in
the
house
with
her
tenants
is
usually
ready
to
lend
a
scuttle
full
of
coal
to
one
of
them
who
may
be
out
of
work
or
to
share
her
supper
a
woman
for
whom
the
writer
had
long
tried
in
vain
to
find
work
failed
to
appear
at
the
appointed
time
when
employment
was
secured
at
last
upon
investigation
it
transpired
that
a
neighbor
further
down
the
street
was
taken
ill
that
the
children
ran
for
the
family
friend
who
went
of
course
saying
simply
when
reasons
for
her
were
demanded
it
broke
me
heart
to
leave
the
place
but
what
could
i
do
a
woman
whose
husband
was
sent
up
to
the
city
prison
for
the
maximum
term
just
three
months
before
the
birth
of
her
child
found
herself
penniless
at
the
end
of
that
time
having
gradually
sold
her
supply
of
household
furniture
she
took
refuge
with
a
friend
whom
she
supposed
to
be
living
in
three
rooms
in
another
part
of
town
when
she
arrived
however
she
discovered
that
her
friend
husband
had
been
out
of
work
so
long
that
they
had
been
reduced
to
living
in
one
room
the
friend
however
took
her
in
and
the
friend
husband
was
obliged
to
sleep
upon
a
bench
in
the
park
every
night
for
a
week
which
he
did
uncomplainingly
if
not
cheerfully
fortunately
it
was
summer
and
it
only
rained
one
night
the
writer
could
not
discover
from
the
young
mother
that
she
had
any
special
claim
upon
the
friend
beyond
the
fact
that
they
had
formerly
worked
together
in
the
same
factory
the
husband
she
had
never
seen
until
the
night
of
her
arrival
when
he
at
once
went
forth
in
search
of
a
midwife
who
would
consent
to
come
upon
his
promise
of
future
payment
the
evolutionists
tell
us
that
the
instinct
to
pity
the
impulse
to
aid
his
fellows
served
man
at
a
very
early
period
as
a
rude
rule
of
right
and
wrong
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
rude
rule
still
holds
among
many
people
with
whom
charitable
agencies
are
brought
into
contact
and
that
their
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
are
quite
honestly
outraged
by
the
methods
of
these
agencies
when
they
see
the
delay
and
caution
with
which
relief
is
given
it
does
not
appear
to
them
a
conscientious
scruple
but
as
the
cold
and
calculating
action
of
a
selfish
man
it
is
not
the
aid
that
they
are
accustomed
to
receive
from
their
neighbors
and
they
do
not
understand
why
the
impulse
which
drives
people
to
be
good
to
the
poor
should
be
so
severely
supervised
they
feel
remotely
that
the
charity
visitor
is
moved
by
motives
that
are
alien
and
unreal
they
may
be
superior
motives
but
they
are
different
and
they
are
agin
nature
they
can
not
comprehend
why
a
person
whose
intellectual
perceptions
are
stronger
than
his
natural
impulses
should
go
into
charity
work
at
all
the
only
man
they
are
accustomed
to
see
whose
intellectual
perceptions
are
stronger
than
his
tenderness
of
heart
is
the
selfish
and
avaricious
man
who
is
frankly
on
the
make
if
the
charity
visitor
is
such
a
person
why
does
she
pretend
to
like
the
poor
why
does
she
not
go
into
business
at
once
we
may
say
of
course
that
it
is
a
primitive
view
of
life
which
thus
confuses
intellectuality
and
business
ability
but
it
is
a
view
quite
honestly
held
by
many
poor
people
who
are
obliged
to
receive
charity
from
time
to
time
in
moments
of
indignation
the
poor
have
been
known
to
say
what
do
you
want
anyway
if
you
have
nothing
to
give
us
why
not
let
us
alone
and
stop
your
questionings
and
investigations
they
investigated
me
for
three
weeks
and
in
the
end
gave
me
nothing
but
a
black
character
a
little
woman
has
been
heard
to
assert
this
indignation
which
is
for
the
most
part
taciturn
and
a
certain
kindly
contempt
for
her
abilities
often
puzzles
the
charity
visitor
the
latter
may
be
explained
by
the
standard
of
worldly
success
which
the
visited
families
hold
success
does
not
ordinarily
go
in
the
minds
of
the
poor
with
charity
and
but
rather
with
the
opposite
qualities
the
rich
landlord
is
he
who
collects
with
sternness
who
accepts
no
excuse
and
will
have
his
own
there
are
moments
of
irritation
and
of
real
bitterness
against
him
but
there
is
still
admiration
because
he
is
rich
and
successful
the
landlord
he
who
pities
and
spares
his
tenants
is
seldom
rich
he
often
lives
in
the
back
of
his
house
which
he
has
owned
for
a
long
time
perhaps
has
inherited
but
he
has
been
able
to
accumulate
little
he
commands
the
genuine
love
and
devotion
of
many
a
poor
soul
but
he
is
treated
with
a
certain
lack
of
respect
in
one
sense
he
is
a
failure
the
charity
visitor
just
because
she
is
a
person
who
concerns
herself
with
the
poor
receives
a
certain
amount
of
this
and
kindly
contempt
sometimes
real
affection
but
little
genuine
respect
the
poor
are
accustomed
to
help
each
other
and
to
respond
according
to
their
kindliness
but
when
it
comes
to
worldly
judgment
they
use
industrial
success
as
the
sole
standard
in
the
case
of
the
charity
visitor
who
has
neither
natural
kindness
nor
dazzling
riches
they
are
deprived
of
both
standards
and
they
find
it
of
course
utterly
impossible
to
judge
of
the
motive
of
organized
charity
even
those
of
us
who
feel
most
sorely
the
need
of
more
order
in
altruistic
effort
and
see
the
end
to
be
desired
find
something
distasteful
in
the
juxtaposition
of
the
words
organized
and
charity
we
say
in
defence
that
we
are
striving
to
turn
this
emotion
into
a
motive
that
pity
is
capricious
and
not
to
be
depended
on
that
we
mean
to
give
it
the
dignity
of
conscious
duty
but
at
bottom
we
distrust
a
little
a
scheme
which
substitutes
a
theory
of
social
conduct
for
the
natural
promptings
of
the
heart
even
although
we
appreciate
the
complexity
of
the
situation
the
poor
man
who
has
fallen
into
distress
when
he
first
asks
aid
instinctively
expects
tenderness
consideration
and
forgiveness
if
it
is
the
first
time
it
has
taken
him
long
to
make
up
his
mind
to
take
the
step
he
comes
somewhat
bruised
and
battered
and
instead
of
being
met
with
warmth
of
heart
and
sympathy
he
is
at
once
chilled
by
an
investigation
and
an
intimation
that
he
ought
to
work
he
does
not
recognize
the
disciplinary
aspect
of
the
situation
the
only
really
popular
charity
is
that
of
the
visiting
nurses
who
by
virtue
of
their
professional
training
render
services
which
may
easily
be
interpreted
into
sympathy
and
kindness
ministering
as
they
do
to
obvious
needs
which
do
not
require
investigation
the
state
of
mind
which
an
investigation
arouses
on
both
sides
is
most
unfortunate
but
the
perplexity
and
clashing
of
different
standards
with
the
consequent
misunderstandings
are
not
so
bad
as
the
moral
deterioration
which
is
almost
sure
to
follow
when
the
agent
or
visitor
appears
among
the
poor
and
they
discover
that
under
certain
conditions
food
and
rent
and
medical
aid
are
dispensed
from
some
unknown
source
every
man
woman
and
child
is
quick
to
learn
what
the
conditions
may
be
and
to
follow
them
though
in
their
eyes
a
glass
of
beer
is
quite
right
and
proper
when
taken
as
any
man
should
take
it
though
they
know
that
cleanliness
is
an
expensive
virtue
which
can
be
required
of
few
though
they
realize
that
saving
is
impossible
when
but
a
few
cents
can
be
laid
by
at
a
time
though
their
feeling
for
the
church
may
be
something
quite
elusive
of
definition
and
quite
apart
from
daily
living
to
the
visitor
they
gravely
laud
temperance
and
cleanliness
and
thrift
and
religious
observance
the
deception
in
the
first
instances
arises
from
a
wondering
inability
to
understand
the
ethical
ideals
which
can
require
such
impossible
virtues
and
from
an
innocent
desire
to
please
it
is
easy
to
trace
the
development
of
the
mental
suggestions
thus
received
when
a
discovers
that
b
who
is
very
little
worse
off
than
he
receives
good
things
from
an
inexhaustible
supply
intended
for
the
poor
at
large
he
feels
that
he
too
has
a
claim
for
his
share
and
step
by
step
there
is
developed
the
competitive
spirit
which
so
horrifies
charity
visitors
when
it
shows
itself
in
a
tendency
to
work
the
agencies
the
most
serious
effect
upon
the
poor
comes
when
dependence
upon
the
charitable
society
is
substituted
for
the
natural
outgoing
of
human
love
and
sympathy
which
happily
we
all
possess
in
some
degree
the
spontaneous
impulse
to
sit
up
all
night
with
the
neighbor
sick
child
is
turned
into
righteous
indignation
against
the
district
nurse
because
she
goes
home
at
six
and
does
do
it
herself
or
the
kindness
which
would
have
prompted
the
quick
purchase
of
much
needed
medicine
is
transformed
into
a
voluble
scoring
of
the
dispensary
because
it
gives
prescriptions
and
not
drugs
and
who
can
get
well
on
a
piece
of
paper
if
a
poor
woman
knows
that
her
neighbor
next
door
has
no
shoes
she
is
quite
willing
to
lend
her
own
that
her
neighbor
may
go
decently
to
mass
or
to
work
for
she
knows
the
smallest
item
about
the
scanty
wardrobe
and
cheerfully
helps
out
when
the
charity
visitor
comes
in
all
the
neighbors
are
baffled
as
to
what
her
circumstances
may
be
they
know
she
does
not
need
a
new
pair
of
shoes
and
rather
suspect
that
she
has
a
dozen
pairs
at
home
which
indeed
she
sometimes
has
they
imagine
untold
stores
which
they
may
call
upon
and
her
most
generous
gift
is
considered
niggardly
compared
with
what
she
might
do
she
ought
to
get
new
shoes
for
the
family
all
round
she
sees
well
enough
that
they
need
them
it
is
no
more
than
the
neighbor
herself
would
do
has
practically
done
when
she
lent
her
own
shoes
the
charity
visitor
has
broken
through
the
natural
rule
of
giving
which
in
a
primitive
society
is
bounded
only
by
the
need
of
the
recipient
and
the
resources
of
the
giver
and
she
gets
herself
into
untold
trouble
when
she
is
judged
by
the
ethics
of
that
primitive
society
the
neighborhood
understands
the
selfish
rich
people
who
stay
in
their
own
part
of
town
where
all
their
associates
have
shoes
and
other
things
such
people
do
bother
themselves
about
the
poor
they
are
like
the
rich
landlords
of
the
neighborhood
experience
but
this
lady
visitor
who
pretends
to
be
good
to
the
poor
and
certainly
does
talk
as
though
she
were
what
does
she
come
for
if
she
does
not
intend
to
give
them
things
which
are
so
plainly
needed
the
visitor
says
sometimes
that
in
holding
her
poor
family
so
hard
to
a
standard
of
thrift
she
is
really
breaking
down
a
rule
of
higher
living
which
they
formerly
possessed
that
saving
which
seems
quite
commendable
in
a
comfortable
part
of
town
appears
almost
criminal
in
a
poorer
quarter
where
the
neighbor
needs
food
even
if
the
children
of
the
family
do
not
she
feels
the
sordidness
of
constantly
being
obliged
to
urge
the
industrial
view
of
life
the
benevolent
individual
of
fifty
years
ago
honestly
believed
that
industry
and
in
youth
would
result
in
comfortable
possessions
for
old
age
it
was
indeed
the
method
he
had
practised
in
his
own
youth
and
by
which
he
had
probably
obtained
whatever
fortune
he
possessed
he
therefore
reproved
the
poor
family
for
indulging
their
children
urged
them
to
work
long
hours
and
was
utterly
untouched
by
many
scruples
which
afflict
the
contemporary
charity
visitor
she
says
sometimes
why
must
i
talk
always
of
getting
work
and
saving
money
the
things
i
know
nothing
about
if
it
were
anything
else
i
had
to
urge
i
could
do
it
anything
like
latin
prose
which
i
had
worried
through
myself
it
would
not
be
so
hard
but
she
finds
it
difficult
to
connect
the
experiences
of
her
youth
with
the
experiences
of
the
visited
family
because
of
this
diversity
in
experience
the
visitor
is
continually
surprised
to
find
that
the
safest
platitude
may
be
challenged
she
refers
quite
naturally
to
the
horrors
of
the
saloon
and
discovers
that
the
head
of
her
visited
family
does
not
connect
them
with
horrors
at
all
he
remembers
all
the
kindnesses
he
has
received
there
the
free
lunch
and
treating
which
goes
on
even
when
a
man
is
out
of
work
and
not
able
to
pay
up
the
loan
of
five
dollars
he
got
there
when
the
charity
visitor
was
miles
away
and
he
was
threatened
with
eviction
he
may
listen
politely
to
her
reference
to
horrors
but
considers
it
only
temperance
talk
the
charity
visitor
may
blame
the
women
for
lack
of
gentleness
toward
their
children
for
being
hasty
and
rude
to
them
until
she
learns
that
the
standard
of
breeding
is
not
that
of
gentleness
toward
the
children
so
much
as
the
observance
of
certain
conventions
such
as
the
punctilious
wearing
of
mourning
garments
after
the
death
of
a
child
the
standard
of
gentleness
each
mother
has
to
work
out
largely
by
herself
assisted
only
by
the
occasional
remark
of
a
neighbor
that
they
do
better
when
you
are
not
too
hard
on
them
but
the
wearing
of
mourning
garments
is
sustained
by
the
definitely
expressed
sentiment
of
every
woman
in
the
street
the
mother
would
have
to
bear
social
blame
a
certain
social
ostracism
if
she
failed
to
comply
with
that
requirement
it
is
not
comfortable
to
outrage
the
conventions
of
those
among
whom
we
live
and
if
our
social
life
be
a
narrow
one
it
is
still
more
difficult
the
visitor
may
choke
a
little
when
she
sees
the
lessened
supply
of
food
and
the
scanty
clothing
provided
for
the
remaining
children
in
order
that
one
may
be
conventionally
mourned
but
she
does
talk
so
strongly
against
it
as
she
would
have
done
during
her
first
month
of
experience
with
the
family
since
bereaved
the
subject
of
clothes
indeed
perplexes
the
visitor
constantly
and
the
result
of
her
reflections
may
be
summed
up
somewhat
in
this
wise
the
girl
who
has
a
definite
social
standing
who
has
been
to
a
fashionable
school
or
to
a
college
whose
family
live
in
a
house
seen
and
known
by
all
her
friends
and
associates
may
afford
to
be
very
simple
or
even
shabby
as
to
her
clothes
if
she
likes
but
the
working
girl
whose
family
lives
in
a
tenement
or
moves
from
one
small
apartment
to
another
who
has
little
social
standing
and
has
to
make
her
own
place
knows
full
well
how
much
habit
and
style
of
dress
has
to
do
with
her
position
her
income
goes
into
her
clothing
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
amount
which
she
spends
upon
other
things
but
if
social
advancement
is
her
aim
it
is
the
most
sensible
thing
she
can
do
she
is
judged
largely
by
her
clothes
her
house
furnishing
with
its
pitiful
little
decorations
her
scanty
supply
of
books
are
never
seen
by
the
people
whose
social
opinions
she
most
values
her
clothes
are
her
background
and
from
them
she
is
largely
judged
it
is
due
to
this
fact
that
girls
clubs
succeed
best
in
the
business
part
of
town
where
working
girls
and
young
ladies
meet
upon
an
equal
footing
and
where
the
clothes
superficially
look
very
much
alike
bright
and
ambitious
girls
will
come
to
these
clubs
to
eat
lunch
and
rest
at
noon
to
study
all
sorts
of
subjects
and
listen
to
lectures
when
they
might
hesitate
a
long
time
before
joining
a
club
identified
with
their
own
neighborhood
where
they
would
be
judged
not
solely
on
their
own
merits
and
the
unconscious
social
standing
afforded
by
good
clothes
but
by
other
surroundings
which
are
not
nearly
up
to
these
for
the
same
reason
girls
clubs
are
infinitely
more
difficult
to
organize
in
little
towns
and
villages
where
every
one
knows
every
one
else
just
how
the
front
parlor
is
furnished
and
the
amount
of
mortgage
there
is
upon
the
house
these
facts
get
in
the
way
of
a
clear
and
unbiassed
judgment
they
impede
the
democratic
relationship
and
add
to
the
of
all
concerned
every
one
who
has
had
to
do
with
girls
clubs
has
had
the
experience
of
going
into
the
home
of
some
bright
girl
to
discover
it
uncomfortable
and
perhaps
wretched
and
to
find
the
girl
afterward
carefully
avoiding
her
although
the
working
girl
may
not
have
been
at
home
when
the
call
was
made
and
the
visitor
may
have
carried
herself
with
the
utmost
courtesy
throughout
in
some
very
successful
clubs
the
home
address
is
not
given
at
all
and
only
the
business
address
is
required
have
we
worked
out
our
democracy
further
in
regard
to
clothes
than
anything
else
the
charity
visitor
has
been
rightly
brought
up
to
consider
it
vulgar
to
spend
much
money
upon
clothes
to
care
so
much
for
appearances
she
realizes
dimly
that
the
care
for
personal
decoration
over
that
for
home
or
habitat
is
in
some
way
primitive
and
undeveloped
but
she
is
silenced
by
its
obvious
need
she
also
catches
a
glimpse
of
the
fact
that
the
disproportionate
expenditure
of
the
poor
in
the
matter
of
clothes
is
largely
due
to
the
exclusiveness
of
the
rich
who
hide
from
them
the
interior
of
their
houses
and
their
more
subtle
pleasures
while
of
necessity
exhibiting
their
street
clothes
and
their
street
manners
every
one
who
goes
shopping
at
the
same
time
may
see
the
clothes
of
the
richest
women
in
town
but
only
those
invited
to
her
receptions
see
the
corot
on
her
walls
or
the
bindings
in
her
library
the
poor
naturally
try
to
bridge
the
difference
by
reproducing
the
street
clothes
which
they
have
seen
they
are
striving
to
conform
to
a
common
standard
which
their
democratic
training
presupposes
belongs
to
all
of
us
the
charity
visitor
may
regret
that
the
italian
peasant
woman
has
laid
aside
her
picturesque
kerchief
and
substituted
a
cheap
street
hat
but
it
is
easy
to
recognize
the
first
attempt
toward
democratic
expression
the
charity
visitor
finds
herself
still
more
perplexed
when
she
comes
to
consider
such
problems
as
those
of
early
marriage
and
child
labor
for
she
can
not
deal
with
them
according
to
economic
theories
or
according
to
the
conventions
which
have
regulated
her
own
life
she
finds
both
of
these
fairly
upset
by
her
intimate
knowledge
of
the
situation
and
her
sympathy
for
those
into
whose
lives
she
has
gained
a
curious
insight
she
discovers
how
incorrigibly
bourgeois
her
standards
have
been
and
it
takes
but
a
little
time
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
she
can
not
insist
so
strenuously
upon
the
conventions
of
her
own
class
which
fail
to
fit
the
bigger
more
emotional
and
freer
lives
of
working
people
the
charity
visitor
holds
views
upon
the
imprudence
of
early
marriages
quite
naturally
because
she
comes
from
a
family
and
circle
of
professional
and
business
people
a
professional
man
is
scarcely
equipped
and
started
in
his
profession
before
he
is
thirty
a
business
man
if
he
is
on
the
road
to
success
is
much
nearer
prosperity
at
than
and
it
is
therefore
wise
for
these
men
not
to
marry
in
the
twenties
but
this
does
not
apply
to
the
workingman
in
many
trades
he
is
laid
upon
the
shelf
at
and
in
nearly
all
trades
he
receives
the
largest
wages
in
his
life
between
twenty
and
thirty
if
the
young
workingman
has
all
his
wages
to
himself
he
will
probably
establish
habits
of
personal
comfort
which
he
can
not
keep
up
when
he
has
to
divide
with
a
family
habits
which
he
can
perhaps
never
overcome
the
sense
of
prudence
the
necessity
for
saving
can
never
come
to
a
primitive
emotional
man
with
the
force
of
a
conviction
but
the
necessity
of
providing
for
his
children
is
a
powerful
incentive
he
naturally
regards
his
children
as
his
he
expects
them
to
care
for
him
when
he
gets
old
and
in
some
trades
old
age
comes
very
early
a
jewish
tailor
was
quite
lately
sent
to
the
cook
county
poorhouse
paralyzed
beyond
recovery
at
the
age
of
had
his
little
boy
of
nine
been
but
a
few
years
older
he
might
have
been
spared
this
sorrow
of
public
charity
he
was
in
fact
better
able
to
well
support
a
family
when
he
was
twenty
than
when
he
was
for
his
wages
had
steadily
grown
less
as
the
years
went
on
another
tailor
whom
i
know
who
is
also
a
socialist
always
speaks
of
saving
as
a
bourgeois
virtue
one
quite
impossible
to
the
genuine
workingman
he
supports
a
family
consisting
of
himself
a
wife
and
three
children
and
his
two
parents
on
eight
dollars
a
week
he
insists
it
would
be
criminal
not
to
expend
every
penny
of
this
amount
upon
food
and
shelter
and
he
expects
his
children
later
to
care
for
him
this
economic
pressure
also
accounts
for
the
tendency
to
put
children
to
work
overyoung
and
thus
cripple
their
chances
for
individual
development
and
usefulness
and
with
the
avaricious
parent
also
leads
to
exploitation
i
have
fed
her
for
fourteen
years
now
she
can
help
me
pay
my
mortgage
is
not
an
unusual
reply
when
a
hardworking
father
is
expostulated
with
because
he
would
take
his
bright
daughter
out
of
school
and
put
her
into
a
factory
it
has
long
been
a
common
error
for
the
charity
visitor
who
is
strongly
urging
her
family
toward
to
suggest
or
at
least
connive
that
the
children
be
put
to
work
early
although
she
has
not
the
excuse
that
the
parents
have
it
is
so
easy
after
one
has
been
taking
the
industrial
view
for
a
long
time
to
forget
the
larger
and
more
social
claim
to
urge
that
the
boy
go
to
work
and
support
his
parents
who
are
receiving
charitable
aid
she
does
not
realize
what
a
cruel
advantage
the
person
who
distributes
charity
has
when
she
gives
advice
the
manager
in
a
huge
mercantile
establishment
employing
many
children
was
able
to
show
during
a
investigation
that
the
only
children
under
fourteen
years
of
age
in
his
employ
were
protégés
who
had
been
urged
upon
him
by
philanthropic
ladies
not
only
acquaintances
of
his
but
valued
patrons
of
the
establishment
it
is
not
that
the
charity
visitor
is
less
wise
than
other
people
but
she
has
fixed
her
mind
so
long
upon
the
industrial
lameness
of
her
family
that
she
is
eager
to
seize
any
crutch
however
weak
which
may
enable
them
to
get
on
she
has
failed
to
see
that
the
boy
who
attempts
to
prematurely
support
his
widowed
mother
may
lower
wages
add
an
illiterate
member
to
the
community
and
arrest
the
development
of
a
capable
workingman
as
she
has
failed
to
see
that
the
rules
which
obtain
in
regard
to
the
age
of
marriage
in
her
own
family
may
not
apply
to
the
workingman
so
also
she
fails
to
understand
that
the
present
conditions
of
employment
surrounding
a
factory
child
are
totally
unlike
those
which
obtained
during
the
energetic
youth
of
her
father
the
child
who
is
prematurely
put
to
work
is
constantly
oppressed
by
this
never
ending
question
of
the
means
of
subsistence
and
even
little
children
are
sometimes
almost
crushed
with
the
cares
of
life
through
their
affectionate
sympathy
the
writer
knows
a
little
italian
lad
of
six
to
whom
the
problems
of
food
clothing
and
shelter
have
become
so
immediate
and
pressing
that
although
an
imaginative
child
he
is
unable
to
see
life
from
any
other
standpoint
the
goblin
or
bugaboo
feared
by
the
more
fortunate
child
in
his
mind
has
come
to
be
the
need
of
coal
which
caused
his
father
hysterical
and
demonstrative
grief
when
it
carried
off
his
mother
inherited
linen
the
mosaic
of
joseph
and
worst
of
all
his
own
rubber
boots
he
once
came
to
a
party
at
and
was
interested
in
nothing
save
a
gas
stove
which
he
saw
in
the
kitchen
he
became
excited
over
the
discovery
that
fire
could
be
produced
without
fuel
i
will
tell
my
father
of
this
stove
you
buy
no
coal
you
need
only
a
match
anybody
will
give
you
a
match
he
was
taken
to
visit
at
a
and
at
once
inquired
how
much
rent
was
paid
for
it
on
being
told
carelessly
by
his
hostess
that
they
paid
no
rent
for
that
house
he
came
back
quite
wild
with
interest
that
the
problem
was
solved
me
and
my
father
will
go
to
the
country
you
get
a
big
house
all
warm
without
rent
nothing
else
in
the
country
interested
him
but
the
subject
of
rent
and
he
talked
of
that
with
an
exclusiveness
worthy
of
a
single
taxer
the
struggle
for
existence
which
is
so
much
harsher
among
people
near
the
edge
of
pauperism
sometimes
leaves
ugly
marks
on
character
and
the
charity
visitor
finds
these
indirect
results
most
mystifying
parents
who
work
hard
and
anticipate
an
old
age
when
they
can
no
longer
earn
take
care
that
their
children
shall
expect
to
divide
their
wages
with
them
from
the
very
first
such
a
parent
when
successful
impresses
the
immature
nervous
system
of
the
child
thus
tyrannically
establishing
habits
of
obedience
so
that
the
nerves
and
will
may
not
depart
from
this
control
when
the
child
is
older
the
charity
visitor
whose
family
relation
is
lifted
quite
out
of
this
does
not
in
the
least
understand
the
industrial
foundation
for
this
family
tyranny
the
head
of
a
kindergarten
once
addressed
a
club
of
working
women
and
spoke
of
the
despotism
which
is
often
established
over
little
children
she
said
that
the
determination
to
break
a
child
will
many
times
arose
from
a
lust
of
dominion
and
she
urged
the
ideal
relationship
founded
upon
love
and
confidence
but
many
of
the
women
were
puzzled
one
of
them
remarked
to
the
writer
as
she
came
out
of
the
club
room
if
you
did
not
keep
control
over
them
from
the
time
they
were
little
you
would
never
get
their
wages
when
they
are
grown
up
another
one
said
ah
of
course
she
meaning
the
speaker
have
to
depend
upon
her
children
wages
she
can
afford
to
be
lax
with
them
because
even
if
they
do
give
money
to
her
she
can
get
along
without
it
there
are
an
impressive
number
of
children
who
uncomplainingly
and
constantly
hand
over
their
weekly
wages
to
their
parents
sometimes
receiving
back
ten
cents
or
a
quarter
for
but
quite
as
often
nothing
at
all
and
the
writer
knows
one
girl
of
who
for
six
years
has
received
two
cents
a
week
from
the
constantly
falling
wages
which
she
earns
in
a
large
factory
is
it
habit
or
virtue
which
holds
her
steady
in
this
course
if
love
and
tenderness
had
been
substituted
for
parental
despotism
would
the
mother
have
had
enough
affection
enough
power
of
expression
to
hold
her
daughter
sense
of
money
obligation
through
all
these
years
this
girl
who
spends
her
paltry
two
cents
on
and
goes
plainly
clad
in
clothes
of
her
mother
choosing
while
many
of
her
friends
spend
their
entire
wages
on
those
clothes
which
factory
girls
love
so
well
must
be
held
by
some
powerful
force
the
charity
visitor
finds
these
subtle
and
elusive
problems
most
harrowing
the
head
of
a
family
she
is
visiting
is
a
man
who
has
become
in
a
strike
he
is
not
a
very
good
workman
and
this
added
to
his
agitator
reputation
keeps
him
out
of
work
for
a
long
time
the
fatal
result
of
being
long
out
of
work
follows
he
becomes
less
and
less
eager
for
it
and
gets
a
job
less
and
less
frequently
in
order
to
keep
up
his
and
still
more
to
keep
his
wife
respect
for
him
he
yields
to
the
little
that
this
prolonged
idleness
follows
because
he
was
once
blacklisted
and
he
gradually
becomes
a
martyr
deep
down
in
his
heart
perhaps
but
who
knows
what
may
be
deep
down
in
his
heart
whatever
may
be
in
his
wife
she
does
not
show
for
an
instant
that
she
thinks
he
has
grown
lazy
and
accustomed
to
see
her
earn
by
sewing
and
cleaning
most
of
the
scanty
income
for
the
family
the
charity
visitor
however
does
see
this
and
she
also
sees
that
the
other
men
who
were
in
the
strike
have
gone
back
to
work
she
further
knows
by
inquiry
and
a
little
experience
that
the
man
is
not
skilful
she
can
not
however
call
him
lazy
and
and
denounce
him
as
worthless
as
her
grandmother
might
have
done
because
of
certain
intellectual
conceptions
at
which
she
has
arrived
she
sees
other
workmen
come
to
him
for
shrewd
advice
she
knows
that
he
spends
many
more
hours
in
the
public
library
reading
good
books
than
the
average
workman
has
time
to
do
he
has
formed
no
bad
habits
and
has
yielded
only
to
those
subtle
temptations
toward
a
life
of
leisure
which
come
to
the
intellectual
man
he
lacks
the
qualifications
which
would
induce
his
union
to
engage
him
as
a
secretary
or
organizer
but
he
is
a
constant
speaker
at
workingmen
meetings
and
takes
a
high
moral
attitude
on
the
questions
discussed
there
he
contributes
a
certain
intellectuality
to
his
friends
and
he
has
undoubted
social
value
the
neighboring
women
confide
to
the
charity
visitor
their
sympathy
with
his
wife
because
she
has
to
work
so
hard
and
because
her
husband
does
not
provide
their
remarks
are
sharpened
by
a
certain
resentment
toward
the
superiority
of
the
husband
education
and
gentle
manners
the
charity
visitor
is
ashamed
to
take
this
point
of
view
for
she
knows
that
it
is
not
altogether
fair
she
is
reminded
of
a
college
friend
of
hers
who
told
her
that
she
was
not
going
to
allow
her
literary
husband
to
write
unworthy
potboilers
for
the
sake
of
earning
a
living
i
insist
that
we
shall
live
within
my
own
income
that
he
shall
not
publish
until
he
is
ready
and
can
give
his
genuine
message
the
charity
visitor
recalls
what
she
has
heard
of
another
acquaintance
who
urged
her
husband
to
decline
a
lucrative
position
as
a
railroad
attorney
because
she
wished
him
to
be
free
to
take
municipal
positions
and
handle
public
questions
without
the
inevitable
suspicion
which
unaccountably
attaches
itself
in
a
corrupt
city
to
a
corporation
attorney
the
action
of
these
two
women
seemed
noble
to
her
but
in
their
cases
they
merely
lived
on
a
lesser
income
in
the
case
of
the
workingman
wife
she
faced
living
on
no
income
at
all
or
on
the
precarious
one
which
she
might
be
able
to
get
together
she
sees
that
this
third
woman
has
made
the
greatest
sacrifice
and
she
is
utterly
unwilling
to
condemn
her
while
praising
the
friends
of
her
own
social
position
she
realizes
of
course
that
the
situation
is
changed
by
the
fact
that
the
third
family
needs
charity
while
the
other
two
do
not
but
after
all
they
have
not
asked
for
it
and
their
plight
was
only
discovered
through
an
accident
to
one
of
the
children
the
charity
visitor
has
been
taught
that
her
mission
is
to
preserve
the
finest
traits
to
be
found
in
her
visited
family
and
she
shrinks
from
the
thought
of
convincing
the
wife
that
her
husband
is
worthless
and
she
suspects
that
she
might
turn
all
this
beautiful
devotion
into
complaining
drudgery
to
be
sure
she
could
give
up
visiting
the
family
altogether
but
she
has
become
much
interested
in
the
progress
of
the
crippled
child
who
eagerly
anticipates
her
visits
and
she
also
suspects
that
she
will
never
know
many
finer
women
than
the
mother
she
is
unwilling
therefore
to
give
up
the
friendship
and
goes
on
bearing
her
perplexities
as
best
she
may
the
first
impulse
of
our
charity
visitor
is
to
be
somewhat
severe
with
her
shiftless
family
for
spending
money
on
pleasures
and
indulging
their
children
out
of
all
proportion
to
their
means
the
poor
family
which
receives
beans
and
coal
from
the
county
and
pays
for
a
bicycle
on
the
instalment
plan
is
not
unknown
to
any
of
us
but
as
the
growth
of
juvenile
crime
becomes
gradually
understood
and
as
the
danger
of
giving
no
legitimate
and
organized
pleasure
to
the
child
becomes
clearer
we
remember
that
primitive
man
had
games
long
before
he
cared
for
a
house
or
regular
meals
there
are
certain
boys
in
many
city
neighborhoods
who
form
themselves
into
little
gangs
with
a
leader
who
is
somewhat
more
intrepid
than
the
rest
their
favorite
performance
is
to
break
into
an
untenanted
house
to
knock
off
the
faucets
and
cut
the
lead
pipe
which
they
sell
to
the
nearest
junk
dealer
with
the
money
thus
procured
they
buy
beer
and
drink
it
in
little
groups
sitting
in
the
alley
from
beginning
to
end
they
have
the
excitement
of
knowing
that
they
may
be
seen
and
caught
by
the
coppers
and
are
at
times
quite
breathless
with
suspense
it
is
not
the
least
unlike
in
motive
and
execution
the
practice
of
country
boys
who
go
forth
in
squads
to
set
traps
for
rabbits
or
to
round
up
a
coon
it
is
characterized
by
a
pure
spirit
for
adventure
and
the
vicious
training
really
begins
when
they
are
arrested
or
when
an
older
boy
undertakes
to
guide
them
into
further
excitements
from
the
very
beginning
the
most
enticing
and
exciting
experiences
which
they
have
seen
have
been
connected
with
crime
the
policeman
embodies
all
the
majesty
of
successful
law
and
established
government
in
his
brass
buttons
and
dazzlingly
equipped
patrol
wagon
the
boy
who
has
been
arrested
comes
back
more
or
less
a
hero
with
a
tale
to
tell
of
the
interior
recesses
of
the
mysterious
police
station
the
earliest
public
excitement
the
child
remembers
is
divided
between
the
rattling
fire
engines
the
time
there
was
a
fire
in
the
next
block
and
all
the
tense
interest
of
the
patrol
wagon
the
time
the
drunkest
lady
in
our
street
was
arrested
in
the
first
year
of
their
settlement
the
residents
took
fifty
kindergarten
children
to
lincoln
park
only
to
be
grieved
by
their
apathetic
interest
in
trees
and
flowers
as
they
came
back
with
an
omnibus
full
of
tired
and
sleepy
children
they
were
surprised
to
find
them
galvanized
into
sudden
life
because
a
patrol
wagon
rattled
by
their
eager
little
heads
popped
out
of
the
windows
full
of
questioning
was
it
a
man
or
a
woman
how
many
policemen
inside
and
eager
little
tongues
began
to
tell
experiences
of
arrests
which
baby
eyes
had
witnessed
the
excitement
of
a
chase
the
chances
of
competition
and
the
love
of
a
fight
are
all
centred
in
the
outward
display
of
crime
the
parent
who
receives
charitable
aid
and
yet
provides
pleasure
for
his
child
and
is
willing
to
indulge
him
in
his
play
is
blindly
doing
one
of
the
wisest
things
possible
and
no
one
is
more
eager
for
playgrounds
and
vacation
schools
than
the
conscientious
charity
visitor
this
very
imaginative
impulse
and
attempt
to
live
in
a
pictured
world
of
their
own
which
seems
the
simplest
prerogative
of
childhood
often
leads
the
boys
into
difficulty
three
boys
aged
seven
nine
and
ten
were
once
brought
into
a
neighboring
police
station
under
the
charge
of
pilfering
and
destroying
property
they
had
dug
a
cave
under
a
railroad
viaduct
in
which
they
had
spent
many
days
and
nights
of
the
summer
vacation
they
had
swiped
potatoes
and
other
vegetables
from
hucksters
carts
which
they
had
cooked
and
eaten
in
true
brigand
fashion
they
had
decorated
the
interior
of
the
excavation
with
stolen
junk
representing
swords
and
firearms
to
their
romantic
imaginations
the
father
of
the
ringleader
was
a
janitor
living
in
a
building
five
miles
away
in
a
prosperous
portion
of
the
city
the
landlord
did
not
want
an
active
boy
in
the
building
and
his
mother
was
dead
the
janitor
paid
for
the
boy
board
and
lodging
to
a
needy
woman
living
near
the
viaduct
she
conscientiously
gave
him
his
breakfast
and
supper
and
left
something
in
the
house
for
his
dinner
every
morning
when
she
went
to
work
in
a
neighboring
factory
but
was
too
tired
by
night
to
challenge
his
statement
that
he
would
rather
sleep
outdoors
in
the
summer
or
to
investigate
what
he
did
during
the
day
in
the
meantime
the
three
boys
lived
in
a
world
of
their
own
made
up
from
the
reading
of
adventurous
stories
and
their
vivid
imaginations
steadily
pilfering
more
and
more
as
the
days
went
by
and
actually
imperilling
the
safety
of
the
traffic
passing
over
the
street
on
the
top
of
the
viaduct
in
spite
of
vigorous
exertions
on
their
behalf
one
of
the
boys
was
sent
to
the
reform
school
comforting
himself
with
the
conclusive
remark
well
we
had
fun
anyway
and
maybe
they
will
let
us
dig
a
cave
at
the
school
it
is
in
the
country
where
we
ca
hurt
anything
in
addition
to
books
of
adventure
or
even
reading
of
any
sort
the
scenes
and
ideals
of
the
theatre
largely
form
the
manners
and
morals
of
the
young
people
going
to
the
theatre
is
indeed
the
most
common
and
satisfactory
form
of
recreation
many
boys
who
conscientiously
give
all
their
wages
to
their
mothers
have
returned
each
week
ten
cents
to
pay
for
a
seat
in
the
gallery
of
a
theatre
on
sunday
afternoon
it
is
their
one
satisfactory
glimpse
of
life
the
moment
when
they
issue
forth
from
themselves
and
are
stirred
and
thoroughly
interested
they
quite
simply
adopt
as
their
own
and
imitate
as
best
they
can
all
that
they
see
there
in
moments
of
genuine
grief
and
excitement
the
words
and
the
gestures
they
employ
are
those
copied
from
the
stage
and
the
tawdry
expression
often
conflicts
hideously
with
the
fine
and
genuine
emotion
of
which
it
is
the
inadequate
and
vulgar
vehicle
as
in
the
matter
of
dress
more
refined
and
simpler
manners
and
mode
of
expressions
are
unseen
by
them
and
they
must
perforce
copy
what
they
know
if
we
agree
with
a
recent
definition
of
art
as
that
which
causes
the
spectator
to
lose
his
sense
of
isolation
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
popular
theatre
with
all
its
faults
more
nearly
fulfils
the
function
of
art
for
the
multitude
of
working
people
than
all
the
free
galleries
and
picture
exhibits
combined
the
greatest
difficulty
is
experienced
when
the
two
standards
come
sharply
together
and
when
both
sides
make
an
attempt
at
understanding
and
explanation
the
difficulty
of
making
clear
one
own
ethical
standpoint
is
at
times
insurmountable
a
woman
who
had
bought
and
sold
school
books
stolen
from
the
school
fund
books
which
are
all
plainly
marked
with
a
red
stamp
came
to
hull
house
one
morning
in
great
distress
because
she
had
been
arrested
and
begged
a
resident
to
speak
to
the
judge
she
gave
as
a
reason
the
fact
that
the
house
had
known
her
for
six
years
and
had
once
been
very
good
to
her
when
her
little
girl
was
buried
the
resident
more
than
suspected
that
her
visitor
knew
the
school
books
were
stolen
when
buying
them
and
any
attempt
to
talk
upon
that
subject
was
evidently
considered
very
rude
the
visitor
wished
to
get
out
of
her
trial
and
evidently
saw
no
reason
why
the
house
should
not
help
her
the
alderman
was
out
of
town
so
she
could
not
go
to
him
after
a
long
conversation
the
visitor
entirely
failed
to
get
another
point
of
view
and
went
away
grieved
and
disappointed
at
a
refusal
thinking
the
resident
simply
disobliging
wondering
no
doubt
why
such
a
mean
woman
had
once
been
good
to
her
leaving
the
resident
on
the
other
hand
utterly
baffled
and
in
the
state
of
mind
she
would
have
been
in
had
she
brutally
insisted
that
a
little
child
should
lift
weights
too
heavy
for
its
undeveloped
muscles
such
a
situation
brings
out
the
impossibility
of
substituting
a
higher
ethical
standard
for
a
lower
one
without
similarity
of
experience
but
it
is
not
as
painful
as
that
illustrated
by
the
following
example
in
which
the
highest
ethical
standard
yet
attained
by
the
charity
recipient
is
broken
down
and
the
substituted
one
not
in
the
least
understood
a
certain
charity
visitor
is
peculiarly
appealed
to
by
the
weakness
and
pathos
of
forlorn
old
age
she
is
responsible
for
the
of
perhaps
a
dozen
old
women
to
whom
she
sustains
a
sincerely
affectionate
and
almost
filial
relation
some
of
them
learn
to
take
her
benefactions
quite
as
if
they
came
from
their
own
relatives
grumbling
at
all
she
does
and
scolding
her
with
a
family
freedom
one
of
these
poor
old
women
was
injured
in
a
fire
years
ago
she
has
but
the
fragment
of
a
hand
left
and
is
grievously
crippled
in
her
feet
through
years
of
pain
she
had
become
addicted
to
opium
and
when
she
first
came
under
the
visitor
care
was
only
held
from
the
poorhouse
by
the
awful
thought
that
she
would
there
perish
without
her
drug
five
years
of
tender
care
have
done
wonders
for
her
she
lives
in
two
neat
little
rooms
where
with
her
thumb
and
two
fingers
she
makes
innumerable
quilts
which
she
sells
and
gives
away
with
the
greatest
delight
her
opium
is
regulated
to
a
set
amount
taken
each
day
and
she
has
been
drawn
away
from
much
drinking
she
is
a
voracious
reader
and
has
her
head
full
of
strange
tales
made
up
from
books
and
her
own
imagination
at
one
time
it
seemed
impossible
to
do
anything
for
her
in
chicago
and
she
was
kept
for
two
years
in
a
suburb
where
the
family
of
the
charity
visitor
lived
and
where
she
was
nursed
through
several
hazardous
illnesses
she
now
lives
a
better
life
than
she
did
but
she
is
still
far
from
being
a
model
old
woman
the
neighbors
are
constantly
shocked
by
the
fact
that
she
is
supported
and
comforted
by
a
charity
lady
while
at
the
same
time
she
occasionally
rushes
the
growler
scolding
at
the
boys
lest
they
jar
her
in
her
tottering
walk
the
care
of
her
has
broken
through
even
that
second
standard
which
the
neighborhood
had
learned
to
recognize
as
the
standard
of
charitable
societies
that
only
the
worthy
poor
are
to
be
helped
that
temperance
and
thrift
are
the
virtues
which
receive
the
plums
of
benevolence
the
old
lady
herself
is
conscious
of
this
criticism
indeed
irate
neighbors
tell
her
to
her
face
that
she
in
the
least
deserve
what
she
gets
in
order
to
disarm
them
and
at
the
same
time
to
explain
what
would
otherwise
seem
so
colossal
as
to
be
abnormal
she
tells
them
that
during
her
sojourn
in
the
suburb
she
discovered
an
awful
family
secret
a
horrible
scandal
connected
with
the
charity
visitor
that
it
is
in
order
to
prevent
the
divulgence
of
this
that
she
constantly
receives
her
ministrations
some
of
her
perplexed
neighbors
accept
this
explanation
as
simple
and
offering
a
solution
of
this
vexed
problem
doubtless
many
of
them
have
a
glimpse
of
the
real
state
of
affairs
of
the
love
and
patience
which
ministers
to
need
irrespective
of
worth
but
the
standard
is
too
high
for
most
of
them
and
it
sometimes
seems
unfortunate
to
break
down
the
second
standard
which
holds
that
people
who
rush
the
growler
are
not
worthy
of
charity
and
that
there
is
a
certain
justice
attained
when
they
go
to
the
poorhouse
it
is
certainly
dangerous
to
break
down
the
lower
unless
the
higher
is
made
clear
just
when
our
affection
becomes
large
enough
to
care
for
the
unworthy
among
the
poor
as
we
would
care
for
the
unworthy
among
our
own
kin
is
certainly
a
perplexing
question
to
say
that
it
should
never
be
so
is
a
comment
upon
our
democratic
relations
to
them
which
few
of
us
would
be
willing
to
make
of
what
use
is
all
this
striving
and
perplexity
has
the
experience
any
value
it
is
certainly
genuine
for
it
induces
an
occasional
charity
visitor
to
live
in
a
tenement
house
as
simply
as
the
other
tenants
do
it
drives
others
to
give
up
visiting
the
poor
altogether
because
they
claim
it
is
quite
impossible
unless
the
individual
becomes
a
member
of
a
sisterhood
which
requires
as
some
of
the
roman
catholic
sisterhoods
do
that
the
member
first
take
the
vows
of
obedience
and
poverty
so
that
she
can
have
nothing
to
give
save
as
it
is
first
given
to
her
and
thus
she
is
not
harassed
by
a
constant
attempt
at
adjustment
both
the
resident
and
the
sister
assume
to
have
put
themselves
upon
the
industrial
level
of
their
neighbors
although
they
have
left
out
the
most
awful
element
of
poverty
that
of
imminent
fear
of
starvation
and
a
neglected
old
age
the
young
charity
visitor
who
goes
from
a
family
living
upon
a
most
precarious
industrial
level
to
her
own
home
in
a
prosperous
part
of
the
city
if
she
is
sensitive
at
all
is
never
free
from
perplexities
which
our
growing
democracy
forces
upon
her
we
sometimes
say
that
our
charity
is
too
scientific
but
we
would
doubtless
be
much
more
correct
in
our
estimate
if
we
said
that
it
is
not
scientific
enough
we
dislike
the
entire
arrangement
of
cards
alphabetically
classified
according
to
streets
and
names
of
families
with
the
unrelated
and
meaningless
details
attached
to
them
our
feeling
of
revolt
is
probably
not
unlike
that
which
afflicted
the
students
of
botany
and
geology
in
the
middle
of
the
last
century
when
flowers
were
tabulated
in
alphabetical
order
when
geology
was
taught
by
colored
charts
and
thin
books
no
doubt
the
students
wearied
to
death
many
times
said
that
it
was
all
too
scientific
and
were
much
perplexed
and
worried
when
they
found
traces
of
structure
and
physiology
which
their
scientific
principles
were
totally
unable
to
account
for
but
all
this
happened
before
science
had
become
evolutionary
and
scientific
at
all
before
it
had
a
principle
of
life
from
within
the
very
indications
and
discoveries
which
formerly
perplexed
later
illumined
and
made
the
study
absorbing
and
vital
we
are
singularly
slow
to
apply
this
evolutionary
principle
to
human
affairs
in
general
although
it
is
fast
being
applied
to
the
education
of
children
we
are
at
last
learning
to
follow
the
development
of
the
child
to
expect
certain
traits
under
certain
conditions
to
adapt
methods
and
matter
to
his
growing
mind
no
advanced
educator
can
allow
himself
to
be
so
absorbed
in
the
question
of
what
a
child
ought
to
be
as
to
exclude
the
discovery
of
what
he
is
but
in
our
charitable
efforts
we
think
much
more
of
what
a
man
ought
to
be
than
of
what
he
is
or
of
what
he
may
become
and
we
ruthlessly
force
our
conventions
and
standards
upon
him
with
a
sternness
which
we
would
consider
stupid
indeed
did
an
educator
use
it
in
forcing
his
mature
intellectual
convictions
upon
an
undeveloped
mind
let
us
take
the
example
of
a
timid
child
who
cries
when
he
is
put
to
bed
because
he
is
afraid
of
the
dark
the
parent
stays
with
him
simply
because
he
is
sorry
for
him
and
wants
to
comfort
him
the
scientifically
trained
parent
stays
with
him
because
he
realizes
that
the
child
is
in
a
stage
of
development
in
which
his
imagination
has
the
best
of
him
and
in
which
it
is
impossible
to
reason
him
out
of
a
belief
in
ghosts
these
two
parents
wide
apart
in
point
of
view
after
all
act
much
alike
and
both
very
differently
from
the
parent
who
acts
from
dogmatic
conviction
and
is
sure
he
is
right
he
talks
of
developing
his
child
and
good
sense
and
leaves
him
to
cry
himself
to
sleep
demanding
powers
of
and
development
which
the
child
does
not
possess
there
is
no
doubt
that
our
development
of
charity
methods
has
reached
this
and
stilted
stage
we
have
learned
to
condemn
unthinking
and
we
take
great
pride
in
mere
repression
much
as
the
stern
parent
tells
the
visitor
below
how
admirably
he
is
rearing
the
child
who
is
hysterically
crying
upstairs
and
laying
the
foundation
for
future
nervous
disorders
the
spirit
or
rather
the
undeveloped
stage
of
our
philanthropy
is
perhaps
most
clearly
revealed
in
our
tendency
to
lay
constant
stress
on
negative
action
do
give
do
break
down
we
are
constantly
told
we
distrust
the
human
impulse
as
well
as
the
teachings
of
our
own
experience
and
in
their
stead
substitute
dogmatic
rules
for
conduct
we
forget
that
the
accumulation
of
knowledge
and
the
holding
of
convictions
must
finally
result
in
the
application
of
that
knowledge
and
those
convictions
to
life
itself
that
the
necessity
for
activity
and
a
pull
upon
the
sympathies
is
so
severe
that
all
the
knowledge
in
the
possession
of
the
visitor
is
constantly
applied
and
she
has
a
reasonable
chance
for
an
ultimate
intellectual
comprehension
indeed
part
of
the
perplexity
in
the
administration
of
charity
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
type
of
person
drawn
to
it
is
the
one
who
insists
that
her
convictions
shall
not
be
unrelated
to
action
her
moral
concepts
constantly
tend
to
float
away
from
her
unless
they
have
a
basis
in
the
concrete
relation
of
life
she
is
confronted
with
the
task
of
reducing
her
scruples
to
action
and
of
converging
many
wills
so
as
to
unite
the
strength
of
all
of
them
into
one
accomplishment
the
value
of
which
no
one
can
foresee
on
the
other
hand
the
young
woman
who
has
succeeded
in
expressing
her
social
compunction
through
charitable
effort
finds
that
the
wider
social
activity
and
the
contact
with
the
larger
experience
not
only
increases
her
sense
of
social
obligation
but
at
the
same
time
recasts
her
social
ideals
she
is
chagrined
to
discover
that
in
the
actual
task
of
reducing
her
social
scruples
to
action
her
humble
beneficiaries
are
far
in
advance
of
her
not
in
charity
or
singleness
of
purpose
but
in
action
she
reaches
the
virtue
of
humility
by
a
social
process
not
in
the
old
way
as
the
man
who
sits
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
puts
dust
upon
his
head
calling
himself
a
contrite
sinner
but
she
gets
the
dust
upon
her
head
because
she
has
stumbled
and
fallen
in
the
road
through
her
efforts
to
push
forward
the
mass
to
march
with
her
fellows
she
has
socialized
her
virtues
not
only
through
a
social
aim
but
by
a
social
process
the
hebrew
prophet
made
three
requirements
from
those
who
would
join
the
great
procession
led
by
jehovah
to
love
mercy
and
at
the
same
time
to
do
justly
is
the
difficult
task
to
fulfil
the
first
requirement
alone
is
to
fall
into
the
error
of
indiscriminate
giving
with
all
its
disastrous
results
to
fulfil
the
second
solely
is
to
obtain
the
stern
policy
of
withholding
and
it
results
in
such
a
dreary
lack
of
sympathy
and
understanding
that
the
establishment
of
justice
is
impossible
it
may
be
that
the
combination
of
the
two
can
never
be
attained
save
as
we
fulfil
still
the
third
requirement
to
walk
humbly
with
god
which
may
mean
to
walk
for
many
dreary
miles
beside
the
lowliest
of
his
creatures
not
even
in
that
peace
of
mind
which
the
company
of
the
humble
is
popularly
supposed
to
afford
but
rather
with
the
pangs
and
throes
to
which
the
poor
human
understanding
is
subjected
whenever
it
attempts
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
life
chapter
iii
filial
relations
there
are
many
people
in
every
community
who
have
not
felt
the
social
compunction
who
do
not
share
the
effort
toward
a
higher
social
morality
who
are
even
unable
to
sympathetically
interpret
it
some
of
these
have
been
shielded
from
the
inevitable
and
salutary
failures
which
the
trial
of
new
powers
involve
because
they
are
content
to
attain
standards
of
virtue
demanded
by
an
easy
public
opinion
and
others
of
them
have
exhausted
their
moral
energy
in
attaining
to
the
current
standard
of
individual
and
family
righteousness
such
people
who
form
the
bulk
of
contented
society
demand
that
the
radical
the
reformer
shall
be
without
stain
or
question
in
his
personal
and
family
relations
and
judge
most
harshly
any
deviation
from
the
established
standards
there
is
a
certain
justice
in
this
it
expresses
the
inherent
conservatism
of
the
mass
of
men
that
none
of
the
established
virtues
which
have
been
so
slowly
and
hardly
acquired
shall
be
sacrificed
for
the
sake
of
making
problematic
advance
that
the
individual
in
his
attempt
to
develop
and
use
the
new
and
exalted
virtue
shall
not
fall
into
the
easy
temptation
of
letting
the
ordinary
ones
slip
through
his
fingers
this
instinct
to
conserve
the
old
standards
combined
with
a
distrust
of
the
new
standard
is
a
constant
difficulty
in
the
way
of
those
experiments
and
advances
depending
upon
the
initiative
of
women
both
because
women
are
the
more
sensitive
to
the
individual
and
family
claims
and
because
their
training
has
tended
to
make
them
content
with
the
response
to
these
claims
alone
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
the
effort
to
sustain
the
moral
energy
necessary
to
work
out
a
more
satisfactory
social
relation
the
individual
often
sacrifices
the
energy
which
should
legitimately
go
into
the
fulfilment
of
personal
and
family
claims
to
what
he
considers
the
higher
claim
in
considering
the
changes
which
our
increasing
democracy
is
constantly
making
upon
various
relationships
it
is
impossible
to
ignore
the
filial
relation
this
chapter
deals
with
the
relation
between
parents
and
their
daughters
as
affording
an
explicit
illustration
of
the
perplexity
and
brought
about
by
the
various
attempts
of
young
women
to
secure
a
more
active
share
in
the
community
life
we
constantly
see
parents
very
much
disconcerted
and
perplexed
in
regard
to
their
daughters
when
these
daughters
undertake
work
lying
quite
outside
of
traditional
and
family
interests
these
parents
insist
that
the
girl
is
carried
away
by
a
foolish
enthusiasm
that
she
is
in
search
of
a
career
that
she
is
restless
and
does
not
know
what
she
wants
they
will
give
any
reason
almost
rather
than
the
recognition
of
a
genuine
and
dignified
claim
possibly
all
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
for
so
many
hundreds
of
years
women
have
had
no
larger
interests
no
participation
in
the
affairs
lying
quite
outside
personal
and
family
claims
any
attempt
that
the
individual
woman
formerly
made
to
subordinate
or
renounce
the
family
claim
was
inevitably
construed
to
mean
that
she
was
setting
up
her
own
will
against
that
of
her
family
for
selfish
ends
it
was
concluded
that
she
could
have
no
motive
larger
than
a
desire
to
serve
her
family
and
her
attempt
to
break
away
must
therefore
be
wilful
and
the
family
logically
consented
to
give
her
up
at
her
marriage
when
she
was
enlarging
the
family
tie
by
founding
another
family
it
was
easy
to
understand
that
they
permitted
and
even
promoted
her
going
to
college
travelling
in
europe
or
any
other
means
of
because
these
merely
meant
the
development
and
cultivation
of
one
of
its
own
members
when
however
she
responded
to
her
impulse
to
fulfil
the
social
or
democratic
claim
she
violated
every
tradition
the
mind
of
each
one
of
us
reaches
back
to
our
first
struggles
as
we
emerged
from
childhood
into
a
recognition
of
family
obligations
we
have
all
gradually
learned
to
respond
to
them
and
yet
most
of
us
have
had
at
least
fleeting
glimpses
of
what
it
might
be
to
disregard
them
and
the
elemental
claim
they
make
upon
us
we
have
yielded
at
times
to
the
temptation
of
ignoring
them
for
selfish
aims
of
considering
the
individual
and
not
the
family
convenience
and
we
remember
with
shame
the
which
inevitably
followed
but
just
as
we
have
learned
to
adjust
the
personal
and
family
claims
and
to
find
an
orderly
development
impossible
without
recognition
of
both
so
perhaps
we
are
called
upon
now
to
make
a
second
adjustment
between
the
family
and
the
social
claim
in
which
neither
shall
lose
and
both
be
ennobled
the
attempt
to
bring
about
a
healing
compromise
in
which
the
two
shall
be
adjusted
in
proper
relation
is
not
an
easy
one
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
between
the
outward
act
of
him
who
in
following
one
legitimate
claim
has
been
led
into
the
temporary
violation
of
another
and
the
outward
act
of
him
who
deliberately
renounces
a
just
claim
and
throws
aside
all
obligation
for
the
sake
of
his
own
selfish
and
individual
development
the
man
for
instance
who
deserts
his
family
that
he
may
cultivate
an
artistic
sensibility
or
acquire
what
he
considers
more
fulness
of
life
for
himself
must
always
arouse
our
contempt
breaking
the
marriage
tie
as
ibsen
nora
did
to
obtain
a
larger
or
holding
to
it
as
george
eliot
romola
did
because
of
the
larger
claim
of
the
state
and
society
must
always
remain
two
distinct
paths
the
collision
of
interests
each
of
which
has
a
real
moral
basis
and
a
right
to
its
own
place
in
life
is
bound
to
be
more
or
less
tragic
it
is
the
struggle
between
two
claims
the
destruction
of
either
of
which
would
bring
ruin
to
the
ethical
life
curiously
enough
it
is
almost
exactly
this
contradiction
which
is
the
tragedy
set
forth
by
the
greek
dramatist
who
asserted
that
the
gods
who
watch
over
the
sanctity
of
the
family
bond
must
yield
to
the
higher
claims
of
the
gods
of
the
state
the
failure
to
recognize
the
social
claim
as
legitimate
causes
the
trouble
the
suspicion
constantly
remains
that
woman
public
efforts
are
merely
selfish
and
captious
and
are
not
directed
to
the
general
good
this
suspicion
will
never
be
dissipated
until
parents
as
well
as
daughters
feel
the
democratic
impulse
and
recognize
the
social
claim
our
democracy
is
making
inroads
upon
the
family
the
oldest
of
human
institutions
and
a
claim
is
being
advanced
which
in
a
certain
sense
is
larger
than
the
family
claim
the
claim
of
the
state
in
time
of
war
has
long
been
recognized
so
that
in
its
name
the
family
has
given
up
sons
and
husbands
and
even
the
fathers
of
little
children
if
we
can
once
see
the
claims
of
society
in
any
such
light
if
its
misery
and
need
can
be
made
clear
and
urged
as
an
explicit
claim
as
the
state
urges
its
claims
in
the
time
of
danger
then
for
the
first
time
the
daughter
who
desires
to
minister
to
that
need
will
be
recognized
as
acting
conscientiously
this
recognition
may
easily
come
first
through
the
emotions
and
may
be
admitted
as
a
response
to
pity
and
mercy
long
before
it
is
formulated
and
perceived
by
the
intellect
the
family
as
well
as
the
state
we
are
all
called
upon
to
maintain
as
the
highest
institutions
which
the
race
has
evolved
for
its
safeguard
and
protection
but
merely
to
preserve
these
institutions
is
not
enough
there
come
periods
of
reconstruction
during
which
the
task
is
laid
upon
a
passing
generation
to
enlarge
the
function
and
carry
forward
the
ideal
of
a
institution
there
is
no
doubt
that
many
women
consciously
and
unconsciously
are
struggling
with
this
task
the
family
like
every
other
element
of
human
life
is
susceptible
of
progress
and
from
epoch
to
epoch
its
tendencies
and
aspirations
are
enlarged
although
its
duties
can
never
be
abrogated
and
its
obligations
can
never
be
cancelled
it
is
impossible
to
bring
about
the
higher
development
by
any
or
breaking
away
of
the
individual
will
the
new
growth
in
the
plant
swelling
against
the
sheath
which
at
the
same
time
imprisons
and
protects
it
must
still
be
the
truest
type
of
progress
the
family
in
its
entirety
must
be
carried
out
into
the
larger
life
its
various
members
together
must
recognize
and
acknowledge
the
validity
of
the
social
obligation
when
this
does
not
occur
we
have
a
most
flagrant
example
of
the
and
misery
arising
when
an
ethical
code
is
applied
too
rigorously
and
too
conscientiously
to
conditions
which
are
no
longer
the
same
as
when
the
code
was
instituted
and
for
which
it
was
never
designed
we
have
all
seen
parental
control
and
the
family
claim
assert
their
authority
in
fields
of
effort
which
belong
to
the
adult
judgment
of
the
child
and
pertain
to
activity
quite
outside
the
family
life
probably
the
distinctively
family
tragedy
of
which
we
all
catch
glimpses
now
and
then
is
the
assertion
of
this
authority
through
all
the
entanglements
of
wounded
affection
and
misunderstanding
we
see
parents
and
children
acting
from
conscientious
motives
and
with
the
tenderest
affection
yet
bringing
about
a
misery
which
can
scarcely
be
hidden
such
glimpses
remind
us
of
that
tragedy
enacted
centuries
ago
in
assisi
when
the
eager
young
noble
cast
his
very
clothing
at
his
father
feet
dramatically
renouncing
his
filial
allegiance
and
formally
subjecting
the
narrow
family
claim
to
the
wider
and
more
universal
duty
all
the
conflict
of
tragedy
ensued
which
might
have
been
averted
had
the
father
recognized
the
higher
claim
and
had
he
been
willing
to
subordinate
and
adjust
his
own
claim
to
it
the
father
considered
his
son
disrespectful
and
yet
we
know
francis
to
have
been
the
most
tender
and
loving
of
men
responsive
to
all
possible
ties
even
to
those
of
inanimate
nature
we
know
that
by
his
affections
he
freed
the
frozen
life
of
his
time
the
elements
of
tragedy
lay
in
the
narrowness
of
the
father
mind
in
his
lack
of
comprehension
and
his
lack
of
sympathy
with
the
power
which
was
moving
his
son
and
which
was
but
part
of
the
religious
revival
which
swept
europe
from
end
to
end
in
the
early
part
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
same
power
which
built
the
cathedrals
of
the
north
and
produced
the
saints
and
sages
of
the
south
but
the
father
situation
was
nevertheless
genuine
he
felt
his
heart
sore
and
angry
and
his
dignity
covered
with
disrespect
he
could
not
indeed
have
felt
otherwise
unless
he
had
been
touched
by
the
fire
of
the
same
revival
and
lifted
out
of
and
away
from
the
contemplation
of
himself
and
his
narrower
claim
it
is
another
proof
that
the
notion
of
a
larger
obligation
can
only
come
through
the
response
to
an
enlarged
interest
in
life
and
in
the
social
movements
around
us
the
son
has
so
long
been
considered
a
citizen
with
duties
and
a
need
of
making
his
way
in
the
world
that
the
family
claim
is
urged
much
less
strenuously
in
his
case
and
as
a
matter
of
authority
it
ceases
gradually
to
be
made
at
all
in
the
case
of
the
daughter
however
who
is
under
no
necessity
of
earning
a
living
and
who
has
no
strong
artistic
bent
taking
her
to
paris
to
study
painting
or
to
germany
to
study
music
the
years
immediately
following
her
graduation
from
college
are
too
often
filled
with
a
restlessness
and
unhappiness
which
might
be
avoided
by
a
little
clear
thinking
and
by
an
adaptation
of
our
code
of
family
ethics
to
modern
conditions
it
is
always
difficult
for
the
family
to
regard
the
daughter
otherwise
than
as
a
family
possession
from
her
babyhood
she
has
been
the
charm
and
grace
of
the
household
and
it
is
hard
to
think
of
her
as
an
integral
part
of
the
social
order
hard
to
believe
that
she
has
duties
outside
of
the
family
to
the
state
and
to
society
in
the
larger
sense
this
assumption
that
the
daughter
is
solely
an
inspiration
and
refinement
to
the
family
itself
and
its
own
immediate
circle
that
her
delicacy
and
polish
are
but
outward
symbols
of
her
father
protection
and
prosperity
worked
very
smoothly
for
the
most
part
so
long
as
her
education
was
in
line
with
it
when
there
was
absolutely
no
recognition
of
the
entity
of
woman
life
beyond
the
family
when
the
outside
claims
upon
her
were
still
wholly
unrecognized
the
situation
was
simple
and
the
finishing
school
harmoniously
and
elegantly
answered
all
requirements
she
was
fitted
to
grace
the
fireside
and
to
add
lustre
to
that
social
circle
which
her
parents
selected
for
her
but
this
family
assumption
has
been
notably
broken
into
and
educational
ideas
no
longer
fit
it
modern
education
recognizes
woman
quite
apart
from
family
or
society
claims
and
gives
her
the
training
which
for
many
years
has
been
deemed
successful
for
highly
developing
a
man
individuality
and
freeing
his
powers
for
independent
action
perplexities
often
occur
when
the
daughter
returns
from
college
and
finds
that
this
recognition
has
been
but
partially
accomplished
when
she
attempts
to
act
upon
the
assumption
of
its
accomplishment
she
finds
herself
jarring
upon
ideals
which
are
so
entwined
with
filial
piety
so
rooted
in
the
tenderest
affections
of
which
the
human
heart
is
capable
that
both
daughter
and
parents
are
shocked
and
startled
when
they
discover
what
is
happening
and
they
scarcely
venture
to
analyze
the
situation
the
ideal
for
the
education
of
woman
has
changed
under
the
pressure
of
a
new
claim
the
family
has
responded
to
the
extent
of
granting
the
education
but
they
are
jealous
of
the
new
claim
and
assert
the
family
claim
as
over
against
it
the
modern
woman
finds
herself
educated
to
recognize
a
stress
of
social
obligation
which
her
family
did
not
in
the
least
anticipate
when
they
sent
her
to
college
she
finds
herself
in
addition
under
an
impulse
to
act
her
part
as
a
citizen
of
the
world
she
accepts
her
family
inheritance
with
loyalty
and
affection
but
she
has
entered
into
a
wider
inheritance
as
well
which
for
lack
of
a
better
phrase
we
call
the
social
claim
this
claim
has
been
recognized
for
four
years
in
her
training
but
after
her
return
from
college
the
family
claim
is
again
exclusively
and
strenuously
asserted
the
situation
has
all
the
discomfort
of
transition
and
compromise
the
daughter
finds
a
constant
and
totally
unnecessary
conflict
between
the
social
and
the
family
claims
in
most
cases
the
former
is
repressed
and
gives
way
to
the
family
claim
because
the
latter
is
concrete
and
definitely
asserted
while
the
social
demand
is
vague
and
unformulated
in
such
instances
the
girl
quietly
submits
but
she
feels
wronged
whenever
she
allows
her
mind
to
dwell
upon
the
situation
she
either
hides
her
hurt
and
splendid
reserves
of
enthusiasm
and
capacity
go
to
waste
or
her
zeal
and
emotions
are
turned
inward
and
the
result
is
an
unhappy
woman
whose
heart
is
consumed
by
vain
regrets
and
desires
if
the
college
woman
is
not
thus
quietly
reabsorbed
she
is
even
reproached
for
her
discontent
she
is
told
to
be
devoted
to
her
family
inspiring
and
responsive
to
her
social
circle
and
to
give
the
rest
of
her
time
to
further
and
enjoyment
she
expects
to
do
this
and
responds
to
these
claims
to
the
best
of
her
ability
even
heroically
sometimes
but
where
is
the
larger
life
of
which
she
has
dreamed
so
long
that
life
which
surrounds
and
completes
the
individual
and
family
life
she
has
been
taught
that
it
is
her
duty
to
share
this
life
and
her
highest
privilege
to
extend
it
this
divergence
between
her
existence
and
her
best
convictions
becomes
constantly
more
apparent
but
the
situation
is
not
even
so
simple
as
a
conflict
between
her
affections
and
her
intellectual
convictions
although
even
that
is
tumultuous
enough
also
the
emotional
nature
is
divided
against
itself
the
social
claim
is
a
demand
upon
the
emotions
as
well
as
upon
the
intellect
and
in
ignoring
it
she
represses
not
only
her
convictions
but
lowers
her
springs
of
vitality
her
life
is
full
of
contradictions
she
looks
out
into
the
world
longing
that
some
demand
be
made
upon
her
powers
for
they
are
too
untrained
to
furnish
an
initiative
when
her
health
gives
way
under
this
strain
as
it
often
does
her
physician
invariably
advises
a
rest
but
to
be
put
to
bed
and
fed
on
milk
is
not
what
she
requires
what
she
needs
is
simple
activity
which
involving
the
use
of
all
her
faculties
shall
be
a
response
to
all
the
claims
which
she
so
keenly
feels
it
is
quite
true
that
the
family
often
resents
her
first
attempts
to
be
part
of
a
life
quite
outside
their
own
because
the
college
woman
frequently
makes
these
first
attempts
most
awkwardly
her
faculties
have
not
been
trained
in
the
line
of
action
she
lacks
the
ability
to
apply
her
knowledge
and
theories
to
life
itself
and
to
its
complicated
situations
this
is
largely
the
fault
of
her
training
and
of
the
of
educational
methods
the
colleges
have
long
been
full
of
the
best
ethical
teaching
insisting
that
the
good
of
the
whole
must
ultimately
be
the
measure
of
effort
and
that
the
individual
can
only
secure
his
own
rights
as
he
labors
to
secure
those
of
others
but
while
the
teaching
has
included
an
range
of
obligation
and
has
insisted
upon
the
recognition
of
the
claims
of
human
brotherhood
the
training
has
been
singularly
individualistic
it
has
fostered
ambitions
for
personal
distinction
and
has
trained
the
faculties
almost
exclusively
in
the
direction
of
intellectual
accumulation
doubtless
woman
education
is
at
fault
in
that
it
has
failed
to
recognize
certain
needs
and
has
failed
to
cultivate
and
guide
the
larger
desires
of
which
all
generous
young
hearts
are
full
during
the
most
formative
years
of
life
it
gives
the
young
girl
no
contact
with
the
feebleness
of
childhood
the
pathos
of
suffering
or
the
needs
of
old
age
it
gathers
together
crude
youth
in
contact
only
with
each
other
and
with
mature
men
and
women
who
are
there
for
the
purpose
of
their
mental
direction
the
tenderest
promptings
are
bidden
to
bide
their
time
this
could
only
be
justifiable
if
a
definite
outlet
were
provided
when
they
leave
college
doubtless
the
need
does
not
differ
widely
in
men
and
women
but
women
not
absorbed
in
professional
or
business
life
in
the
years
immediately
following
college
are
baldly
brought
face
to
face
with
the
deficiencies
of
their
training
apparently
every
obstacle
is
removed
and
the
college
woman
is
at
last
free
to
begin
the
active
life
for
which
during
so
many
years
she
has
been
preparing
but
during
this
preparation
her
faculties
have
been
trained
solely
for
accumulation
and
she
has
learned
to
utterly
distrust
the
finer
impulses
of
her
nature
which
would
naturally
have
connected
her
with
human
interests
outside
of
her
family
and
her
own
immediate
social
circle
all
through
school
and
college
the
young
soul
dreamed
of
of
succor
to
the
helpless
and
of
tenderness
to
the
unfortunate
we
persistently
distrust
these
desires
and
unless
they
follow
lines
we
repress
them
with
every
device
of
convention
and
caution
one
summer
the
writer
went
from
a
two
weeks
residence
in
east
london
where
she
had
become
sick
and
bewildered
by
the
sights
and
sounds
encountered
there
directly
to
switzerland
she
found
the
beaten
routes
of
travel
filled
with
young
english
men
and
women
who
could
walk
many
miles
a
day
and
who
could
climb
peaks
so
inaccessible
that
the
feats
received
honorable
mention
in
alpine
journals
a
result
which
filled
their
families
with
joy
and
pride
these
young
people
knew
to
a
nicety
the
proper
diet
and
clothing
which
would
best
contribute
toward
endurance
everything
was
very
fine
about
them
save
their
motive
power
the
writer
does
not
refer
to
the
men
and
women
who
were
taking
a
vacation
but
to
the
leisured
young
people
to
whom
this
period
was
the
most
serious
of
the
year
and
filled
with
the
most
strenuous
exertion
they
did
not
of
course
thoroughly
enjoy
it
for
we
are
too
complicated
to
be
content
with
mere
exercise
civilization
has
bound
us
too
closely
with
our
brethren
for
any
one
of
us
to
be
long
happy
in
the
cultivation
of
mere
individual
force
or
in
the
accumulation
of
mere
muscular
energy
with
whitechapel
constantly
in
mind
it
was
difficult
not
to
advise
these
young
people
to
use
some
of
this
muscular
energy
of
which
they
were
so
proud
in
cleaning
neglected
alleys
and
paving
soggy
streets
their
stores
of
enthusiasm
might
stir
to
energy
the
listless
men
and
women
of
east
london
and
utilize
latent
social
forces
the
exercise
would
be
quite
as
good
the
need
of
endurance
as
great
the
care
for
proper
dress
and
food
as
important
but
the
motives
for
action
would
be
turned
from
selfish
ones
into
social
ones
such
an
appeal
would
doubtless
be
met
with
a
certain
response
from
the
young
people
but
would
never
be
countenanced
by
their
families
for
an
instant
fortunately
a
beginning
has
been
made
in
another
direction
and
a
few
parents
have
already
begun
to
consider
even
their
little
children
in
relation
to
society
as
well
as
to
the
family
the
young
mothers
who
attend
child
study
classes
have
a
larger
notion
of
parenthood
and
expect
given
characteristics
from
their
children
at
certain
ages
and
under
certain
conditions
they
quite
calmly
watch
the
various
attempts
of
a
child
to
assert
his
individuality
which
so
often
takes
the
form
of
opposition
to
the
wishes
of
the
family
and
to
the
rule
of
the
household
they
recognize
as
acting
under
the
same
law
of
development
the
little
child
of
three
who
persistently
runs
away
and
pretends
not
to
hear
his
mother
voice
the
boy
of
ten
who
violently
although
temporarily
resents
control
of
any
sort
and
the
son
who
by
an
individualized
and
trained
personality
is
drawn
into
pursuits
and
interests
quite
alien
to
those
of
his
family
this
attempt
to
take
the
parental
relation
somewhat
away
from
mere
personal
experience
as
well
as
the
increasing
tendency
of
parents
to
share
their
children
pursuits
and
interests
will
doubtless
finally
result
in
a
better
understanding
of
the
social
obligation
the
understanding
which
results
from
identity
of
interests
would
seem
to
confirm
the
conviction
that
in
the
complicated
life
of
there
is
no
education
so
admirable
as
that
education
which
comes
from
participation
in
the
constant
trend
of
events
there
is
no
doubt
that
most
of
the
misunderstandings
of
life
are
due
to
partial
intelligence
because
our
experiences
have
been
so
unlike
that
we
can
not
comprehend
each
other
the
old
difficulties
incident
to
the
clash
of
two
codes
of
morals
must
drop
away
as
the
experiences
of
various
members
of
the
family
become
larger
and
more
identical
at
the
present
moment
however
many
of
those
difficulties
still
exist
and
may
be
seen
all
about
us
in
order
to
illustrate
the
situation
baldly
and
at
the
same
time
to
put
it
dramatically
it
may
be
well
to
take
an
instance
concerning
which
we
have
no
personal
feeling
the
tragedy
of
king
lear
has
been
selected
although
we
have
been
accustomed
so
long
to
give
him
our
sympathy
as
the
victim
of
the
ingratitude
of
his
two
older
daughters
and
of
the
apparent
coldness
of
cordelia
that
we
have
not
sufficiently
considered
the
weakness
of
his
fatherhood
revealed
by
the
fact
that
he
should
get
himself
into
so
entangled
and
unhappy
a
relation
to
all
of
his
children
in
our
pity
for
lear
we
fail
to
analyze
his
character
the
king
on
his
throne
exhibits
utter
lack
of
the
king
in
the
storm
gives
way
to
the
same
emotion
in
repining
over
the
wickedness
of
his
children
which
he
formerly
exhibited
in
his
indulgent
treatment
of
them
it
might
be
illuminating
to
discover
wherein
he
had
failed
and
why
his
old
age
found
him
roofless
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
strenuously
urged
the
family
claim
with
his
whole
conscience
at
the
opening
of
the
drama
he
sat
upon
his
throne
ready
for
the
enjoyment
which
an
indulgent
parent
expects
when
he
has
given
gifts
to
his
children
from
the
two
elder
the
responses
for
the
division
of
his
lands
were
graceful
and
fitting
but
he
longed
to
hear
what
cordelia
his
youngest
and
best
beloved
child
would
say
he
looked
toward
her
expectantly
but
instead
of
delight
and
gratitude
there
was
the
first
dawn
of
character
cordelia
made
the
awkward
attempt
of
an
untrained
soul
to
be
honest
and
scrupulously
to
express
her
inmost
feeling
the
king
was
baffled
and
distressed
by
this
attempt
at
it
was
new
to
him
that
his
daughter
should
be
moved
by
a
principle
obtained
outside
himself
which
even
his
imagination
could
not
follow
that
she
had
caught
the
notion
of
an
existence
in
which
her
relation
as
a
daughter
played
but
a
part
she
was
transformed
by
a
dignity
which
recast
her
speech
and
made
it
she
found
herself
in
the
sweep
of
a
feeling
so
large
that
the
immediate
loss
of
a
kingdom
seemed
of
little
consequence
to
her
even
an
act
which
might
be
construed
as
disrespect
to
her
father
was
justified
in
her
eyes
because
she
was
vainly
striving
to
fill
out
this
larger
conception
of
duty
the
test
which
comes
sooner
or
later
to
many
parents
had
come
to
lear
to
maintain
the
tenderness
of
the
relation
between
father
and
child
after
that
relation
had
become
one
between
adults
to
be
content
with
the
responses
made
by
the
adult
child
to
the
family
claim
while
at
the
same
time
she
responded
to
the
claims
of
the
rest
of
life
the
mind
of
lear
was
not
big
enough
for
this
test
he
failed
to
see
anything
but
the
personal
slight
involved
and
the
ingratitude
alone
reached
him
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
calmly
watch
his
child
developing
beyond
the
stretch
of
his
own
mind
and
sympathy
that
a
man
should
be
so
absorbed
in
his
own
indignation
as
to
fail
to
apprehend
his
child
thought
that
he
should
lose
his
affection
in
his
anger
simply
reveals
the
fact
that
his
own
emotions
are
dearer
to
him
than
his
sense
of
paternal
obligation
lear
apparently
also
ignored
the
common
ancestry
of
cordelia
and
himself
and
forgot
her
royal
inheritance
of
magnanimity
he
had
thought
of
himself
so
long
as
a
noble
and
indulgent
father
that
he
had
lost
the
faculty
by
which
he
might
perceive
himself
in
the
wrong
even
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
he
declared
himself
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
he
could
believe
any
amount
of
kindness
and
goodness
of
himself
but
could
imagine
no
fidelity
on
the
part
of
cordelia
unless
she
gave
him
the
sign
he
demanded
at
length
he
suffered
many
hardships
his
spirit
was
buffeted
and
broken
he
lost
his
reason
as
well
as
his
kingdom
but
for
the
first
time
his
experience
was
identical
with
the
experience
of
the
men
around
him
and
he
came
to
a
larger
conception
of
life
he
put
himself
in
the
place
of
the
poor
naked
wretches
and
unexpectedly
found
healing
and
comfort
he
took
poor
tim
in
his
arms
from
a
sheer
desire
for
human
contact
and
animal
warmth
a
primitive
and
genuine
need
through
which
he
suddenly
had
a
view
of
the
world
which
he
had
never
had
from
his
throne
and
from
this
moment
his
heart
began
to
turn
toward
cordelia
in
reading
the
tragedy
of
king
lear
cordelia
receives
a
full
share
of
our
censure
her
first
words
are
cold
and
we
are
shocked
by
her
lack
of
tenderness
why
should
she
ignore
her
father
need
for
indulgence
and
be
unwilling
to
give
him
what
he
so
obviously
craved
we
see
in
the
old
king
the
desire
of
being
beloved
selfish
and
yet
characteristic
of
the
selfishness
of
a
loving
and
kindly
nature
alone
his
eagerness
produces
in
us
a
strange
pity
for
him
and
we
are
impatient
that
his
youngest
and
child
can
not
feel
this
even
in
the
midst
of
her
search
for
truth
and
her
newly
acquired
sense
of
a
higher
duty
it
seems
to
us
a
narrow
conception
that
would
break
thus
abruptly
with
the
past
and
would
assume
that
her
father
had
no
part
in
the
new
life
we
want
to
remind
her
that
pity
memory
and
faithfulness
are
natural
ties
and
surely
as
much
to
be
prized
as
is
the
development
of
her
own
soul
we
do
not
admire
the
cordelia
who
through
her
deserts
her
father
as
we
later
admire
the
same
woman
who
comes
back
from
france
that
she
may
include
her
father
in
her
happiness
and
freer
life
the
first
had
selfishly
taken
her
salvation
for
herself
alone
and
it
was
not
until
her
conscience
had
developed
in
her
new
life
that
she
was
driven
back
to
her
father
where
she
perished
drawn
into
the
cruelty
and
wrath
which
had
now
become
objective
and
tragic
historically
considered
the
relation
of
lear
to
his
children
was
archaic
and
barbaric
indicating
merely
the
beginning
of
a
family
life
since
developed
his
paternal
expression
was
one
of
domination
and
indulgence
without
the
perception
of
the
needs
of
his
children
without
any
anticipation
of
their
entrance
into
a
wider
life
or
any
belief
that
they
could
have
a
worthy
life
apart
from
him
if
that
rudimentary
conception
of
family
life
ended
in
such
violent
disaster
the
fact
that
we
have
learned
to
be
more
decorous
in
our
conduct
does
not
demonstrate
that
by
following
the
same
line
of
theory
we
may
not
reach
a
like
misery
wounded
affection
there
is
sure
to
be
but
this
could
be
reduced
to
a
modicum
if
we
could
preserve
a
sense
of
the
relation
of
the
individual
to
the
family
and
of
the
latter
to
society
and
if
we
had
been
given
a
code
of
ethics
dealing
with
these
larger
relationships
instead
of
a
code
designed
to
apply
so
exclusively
to
relationships
obtaining
only
between
individuals
doubtless
the
clashes
and
jars
which
we
all
feel
most
keenly
are
those
which
occur
when
two
standards
of
morals
both
honestly
held
and
believed
in
are
brought
sharply
together
the
awkwardness
and
constraint
we
experience
when
two
standards
of
conventions
and
manners
clash
but
feebly
prefigure
this
deeper
difference
chapter
iv
household
adjustment
if
we
could
only
be
judged
or
judge
other
people
by
purity
of
motive
life
would
be
much
simplified
but
that
would
be
to
abandon
the
contention
made
in
the
first
chapter
that
the
processes
of
life
are
as
important
as
its
aims
we
can
all
recall
acquaintances
of
whose
integrity
of
purpose
we
can
have
no
doubt
but
who
cause
much
confusion
as
they
proceed
to
the
accomplishment
of
that
purpose
who
indeed
are
often
insensible
to
their
own
mistakes
and
harsh
in
their
judgments
of
other
people
because
they
are
so
confident
of
their
own
inner
integrity
this
tendency
to
be
so
sure
of
integrity
of
purpose
as
to
be
unsympathetic
and
hardened
to
the
means
by
which
it
is
accomplished
is
perhaps
nowhere
so
obvious
as
in
the
household
itself
it
nowhere
operates
as
so
constant
a
force
as
in
the
minds
of
the
women
who
in
all
the
perplexity
of
industrial
transition
are
striving
to
administer
domestic
affairs
the
ethics
held
by
them
are
for
the
most
part
the
individual
and
family
codes
untouched
by
the
larger
social
conceptions
these
women
rightly
confident
of
their
household
and
family
integrity
and
holding
to
their
own
code
of
morals
fail
to
see
the
household
in
its
social
aspect
possibly
no
relation
has
been
so
slow
to
respond
to
the
social
ethics
which
we
are
now
considering
as
that
between
the
household
employer
and
the
household
employee
or
as
it
is
still
sometimes
called
that
between
mistress
and
servant
this
persistence
of
the
individual
code
in
relation
to
the
household
may
be
partly
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
orderly
life
and
in
a
sense
civilization
itself
grew
from
the
concentration
of
interest
in
one
place
and
that
moral
feeling
first
became
centred
in
a
limited
number
of
persons
from
the
familiar
proposition
that
the
home
began
because
the
mother
was
obliged
to
stay
in
one
spot
in
order
to
cherish
the
child
we
can
see
a
foundation
for
the
belief
that
if
women
are
much
away
from
home
the
home
itself
will
be
destroyed
and
all
ethical
progress
endangered
we
have
further
been
told
that
the
earliest
dances
and
social
gatherings
were
most
questionable
in
their
purposes
and
that
it
was
therefore
the
good
and
virtuous
women
who
first
stayed
at
home
until
gradually
the
two
the
woman
who
stayed
at
home
and
the
woman
who
guarded
her
virtue
became
synonymous
a
code
of
ethics
was
thus
developed
in
regard
to
woman
conduct
and
her
duties
were
logically
and
carefully
limited
to
her
own
family
circle
when
it
became
impossible
to
adequately
minister
to
the
needs
of
this
circle
without
the
help
of
many
people
who
did
not
strictly
belong
to
the
family
although
they
were
part
of
the
household
they
were
added
as
aids
merely
for
supplying
these
needs
when
women
were
the
brewers
and
bakers
the
fullers
dyers
spinners
and
weavers
the
soap
and
candle
makers
they
administered
large
industries
but
solely
from
the
family
point
of
view
only
a
few
hundred
years
ago
woman
had
complete
control
of
the
manufacturing
of
many
commodities
which
now
figure
so
largely
in
commerce
and
it
is
evident
that
she
let
the
manufacturing
of
these
commodities
go
into
the
hands
of
men
as
soon
as
organization
and
a
larger
conception
of
their
production
were
required
she
felt
no
responsibility
for
their
management
when
they
were
taken
from
the
home
to
the
factory
for
deeper
than
her
instinct
to
manufacture
food
and
clothing
for
her
family
was
her
instinct
to
stay
with
them
and
by
isolation
and
care
to
guard
them
from
evil
she
had
become
convinced
that
a
woman
duty
extended
only
to
her
own
family
and
that
the
world
outside
had
no
claim
upon
her
the
british
matron
ordered
her
maidens
aright
when
they
were
spinning
under
her
own
roof
but
she
felt
no
compunction
of
conscience
when
the
morals
and
health
of
young
girls
were
endangered
in
the
overcrowded
and
insanitary
factories
the
code
of
family
ethics
was
established
in
her
mind
so
firmly
that
it
excluded
any
notion
of
social
effort
it
is
quite
possible
to
accept
this
explanation
of
the
origin
of
morals
and
to
believe
that
the
preservation
of
the
home
is
at
the
foundation
of
all
that
is
best
in
civilization
without
at
the
same
time
insisting
that
the
separate
preparation
and
serving
of
food
is
an
inherent
part
of
the
structure
and
sanctity
of
the
home
or
that
those
who
minister
to
one
household
shall
minister
to
that
exclusively
but
to
make
this
distinction
seems
difficult
and
almost
invariably
the
sense
of
obligation
to
the
family
becomes
confused
with
a
certain
sort
of
domestic
management
the
moral
issue
involved
in
one
has
become
inextricably
combined
with
the
industrial
difficulty
involved
in
the
other
and
it
is
at
this
point
that
so
many
perplexed
housekeepers
through
the
confusion
of
the
two
problems
take
a
difficult
and
untenable
position
there
are
economic
as
well
as
ethical
reasons
for
this
survival
of
a
simpler
code
the
wife
of
a
workingman
still
has
a
distinct
economic
value
to
her
husband
she
cooks
cleans
washes
and
mends
services
for
which
before
his
marriage
he
paid
ready
money
the
wife
of
the
successful
business
or
professional
man
does
not
do
this
he
continues
to
pay
for
his
cooking
house
service
and
washing
the
mending
however
is
still
largely
performed
by
his
wife
indeed
the
stockings
are
pathetically
retained
and
their
darning
given
an
exaggerated
importance
as
if
women
instinctively
felt
that
these
mended
stockings
were
the
last
remnant
of
the
entire
household
industry
of
which
they
were
formerly
mistresses
but
one
industry
the
cooking
and
serving
of
foods
to
her
own
family
woman
has
never
relinquished
it
has
therefore
never
been
organized
either
by
men
or
women
and
is
in
an
undeveloped
state
each
employer
of
household
labor
views
it
solely
from
the
family
standpoint
the
ethics
prevailing
in
regard
to
it
are
distinctly
personal
and
unsocial
and
result
in
the
unique
isolation
of
the
household
employee
as
industrial
conditions
have
changed
the
household
has
simplified
from
the
mediæval
affair
of
journeymen
apprentices
and
maidens
who
spun
and
brewed
to
the
family
proper
to
those
who
love
each
other
and
live
together
in
ties
of
affection
and
consanguinity
were
this
process
complete
we
should
have
no
problem
of
household
employment
but
even
in
households
comparatively
humble
there
is
still
one
alien
one
who
is
neither
loved
nor
loving
the
modern
family
has
dropped
the
man
who
made
its
shoes
the
woman
who
spun
its
clothes
and
to
a
large
extent
the
woman
who
washes
them
but
it
stoutly
refuses
to
drop
the
woman
who
cooks
its
food
and
ministers
directly
to
its
individual
comfort
it
strangely
insists
that
to
do
that
would
be
to
destroy
the
family
life
itself
the
cook
is
uncomfortable
the
family
is
uncomfortable
but
it
will
not
drop
her
as
all
her
have
been
dropped
although
the
cook
herself
insists
upon
it
so
far
has
this
insistence
gone
that
every
possible
concession
is
made
to
retain
her
the
writer
knows
an
employer
in
one
of
the
suburbs
who
built
a
bay
at
the
back
of
her
house
so
that
her
cook
might
have
a
pleasant
room
in
which
to
sleep
and
another
in
which
to
receive
her
friends
this
employer
naturally
felt
aggrieved
when
the
cook
refused
to
stay
in
her
bay
viewed
in
an
historic
light
this
employer
might
quite
as
well
have
added
a
bay
to
her
house
for
her
shoemaker
and
then
deemed
him
ungrateful
because
he
declined
to
live
in
it
a
listener
attentive
to
a
conversation
between
two
employers
of
household
labor
and
we
certainly
all
have
opportunity
to
hear
such
conversations
would
often
discover
a
tone
implying
that
the
employer
was
abused
and
put
upon
that
she
was
struggling
with
the
problem
solely
because
she
was
thus
serving
her
family
and
performing
her
social
duties
that
otherwise
it
would
be
a
great
relief
to
her
to
abandon
the
entire
situation
and
never
have
a
servant
in
her
house
again
did
she
follow
this
impulse
she
would
simply
yield
to
the
trend
of
her
times
and
accept
the
present
system
of
production
she
would
be
in
line
with
the
industrial
organization
of
her
age
were
she
in
line
ethically
she
would
have
to
believe
that
the
sacredness
and
beauty
of
family
life
do
not
consist
in
the
processes
of
the
separate
preparation
of
food
but
in
sharing
the
corporate
life
of
the
community
and
in
making
the
family
the
unit
of
that
life
the
selfishness
of
a
modern
mistress
who
in
her
narrow
social
ethics
insists
that
those
who
minister
to
the
comforts
of
her
family
shall
minister
to
it
alone
that
they
shall
not
only
be
celibate
but
shall
be
cut
off
more
or
less
from
their
natural
social
ties
excludes
the
best
from
her
service
a
man
of
dignity
and
ability
is
quite
willing
to
come
into
a
house
to
tune
a
piano
another
man
of
mechanical
skill
will
come
to
put
up
window
shades
another
of
less
skill
but
of
perfect
independence
will
come
to
clean
and
relay
a
carpet
these
men
would
all
resent
the
situation
and
consider
it
quite
impossible
if
it
implied
the
giving
up
of
their
family
and
social
ties
and
living
under
the
roof
of
the
household
requiring
their
services
the
isolation
of
the
household
employee
is
perhaps
inevitable
so
long
as
the
employer
holds
her
belated
ethics
but
the
situation
is
made
even
more
difficult
by
the
character
and
capacity
of
the
girls
who
enter
this
industry
in
any
great
industrial
change
the
workmen
who
are
permanently
displaced
are
those
who
are
too
dull
to
seize
upon
changed
conditions
the
workmen
who
have
knowledge
and
insight
who
are
in
touch
with
their
time
quickly
reorganize
the
general
statement
may
be
made
that
the
enterprising
girls
of
the
community
go
into
factories
and
the
less
enterprising
go
into
households
although
there
are
many
exceptions
it
is
not
a
question
of
skill
of
energy
of
conscientious
work
which
will
make
a
girl
rise
industrially
while
she
is
in
the
household
she
is
not
in
the
rising
movement
she
is
belated
in
a
class
composed
of
the
unprogressive
elements
of
the
community
which
is
recruited
constantly
by
those
from
the
ranks
of
the
incompetent
by
girls
who
are
learning
the
language
girls
who
are
timid
and
slow
or
girls
who
look
at
life
solely
from
the
point
of
view
the
distracted
housekeeper
struggles
with
these
unprogressive
girls
holding
to
them
not
even
the
and
independent
relation
of
employer
and
employed
but
the
hazy
and
constantly
changing
one
of
mistress
to
servant
the
latter
relation
is
changing
under
pressure
from
various
directions
in
our
increasing
democracy
the
notion
of
personal
service
is
constantly
becoming
more
distasteful
conflicting
as
it
does
with
the
more
modern
notion
of
personal
dignity
personal
ministration
to
the
needs
of
childhood
illness
and
old
age
seem
to
us
reasonable
and
the
democratic
adjustment
in
regard
to
them
is
being
made
the
first
two
are
constantly
raised
nearer
to
the
level
of
a
profession
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
third
will
soon
follow
but
personal
ministrations
to
a
normal
healthy
adult
consuming
the
time
and
energy
of
another
adult
we
find
more
difficult
to
reconcile
to
our
theories
of
democracy
a
factory
employer
parts
with
his
men
at
the
factory
gates
at
the
end
of
a
day
work
they
go
to
their
homes
as
he
goes
to
his
in
the
assumption
that
they
both
do
what
they
want
and
spend
their
money
as
they
please
but
this
solace
of
equality
outside
of
working
hours
is
denied
the
bewildered
employer
of
household
labor
she
is
obliged
to
live
constantly
in
the
same
house
with
her
employee
and
because
of
certain
equalities
in
food
and
shelter
she
is
brought
more
sharply
face
to
face
with
the
mental
and
social
inequalities
the
difficulty
becomes
more
apparent
as
the
character
of
the
work
performed
by
the
servant
is
less
absolutely
useful
and
may
be
merely
time
consuming
a
woman
who
will
complacently
take
an
afternoon
drive
leaving
her
cook
to
prepare
the
five
courses
of
a
little
dinner
for
only
ten
guests
will
not
be
nearly
so
comfortable
the
next
evening
when
she
speeds
her
daughter
to
a
dance
conscious
that
her
waitress
must
spend
the
evening
in
dull
solitude
on
the
chance
that
a
caller
or
two
may
ring
the
a
conscientious
employer
once
remarked
to
the
writer
in
england
it
must
be
much
easier
the
maid
does
not
look
and
dress
so
like
your
daughter
and
you
can
at
least
pretend
that
she
does
like
the
same
things
but
really
my
new
waitress
is
quite
as
pretty
and
stylish
as
my
daughter
is
and
her
wistful
look
sometimes
when
mary
goes
off
to
a
frolic
quite
breaks
my
heart
too
many
employers
of
domestic
service
have
always
been
exempt
from
manual
labor
and
therefore
constantly
impose
exacting
duties
upon
employees
the
nature
of
which
they
do
not
understand
by
experience
there
is
thus
no
curb
of
rationality
imposed
upon
the
requirements
and
demands
she
is
totally
unlike
the
foreman
in
a
shop
who
has
only
risen
to
his
position
by
way
of
having
actually
performed
with
his
own
hands
all
the
work
of
the
men
he
directs
there
is
also
another
class
of
employers
of
domestic
labor
who
grow
capricious
and
through
sheer
lack
of
larger
interests
to
occupy
their
minds
it
is
equally
bad
for
them
and
the
employee
that
the
duties
of
the
latter
are
not
clearly
defined
tolstoy
contends
that
an
exaggerated
notion
of
cleanliness
has
developed
among
such
employers
which
could
never
have
been
evolved
among
usefully
employed
people
he
points
to
the
fact
that
a
serving
man
in
order
that
his
hands
may
be
immaculately
clean
is
kept
from
performing
the
heavier
work
of
the
household
and
then
is
supplied
with
a
tray
upon
which
to
place
a
card
in
order
that
even
his
clean
hands
may
not
touch
it
later
even
his
clean
hands
are
covered
with
a
pair
of
clean
white
gloves
which
hold
the
tray
upon
which
the
card
is
placed
if
it
were
not
for
the
undemocratic
ethics
used
by
the
employers
of
domestics
much
work
now
performed
in
the
household
would
be
done
outside
as
is
true
of
many
products
formerly
manufactured
in
the
feudal
household
the
worker
in
all
other
trades
has
complete
control
of
his
own
time
after
the
performance
of
definitely
limited
services
his
wages
are
paid
altogether
in
money
which
he
may
spend
in
the
maintenance
of
a
separate
home
life
and
he
has
full
opportunity
to
organize
with
the
other
workers
in
his
trade
the
domestic
employee
is
retained
in
the
household
largely
because
her
mistress
fatuously
believes
that
she
is
thus
maintaining
the
sanctity
of
family
life
the
household
employee
has
no
regular
opportunity
for
meeting
other
workers
of
her
trade
and
of
attaining
with
them
the
dignity
of
a
corporate
body
the
industrial
isolation
of
the
household
employee
results
as
isolation
in
a
trade
must
always
result
in
a
lack
of
progress
in
the
methods
and
products
of
that
trade
and
a
lack
of
aspiration
and
education
in
the
workman
whether
we
recognize
this
isolation
as
a
cause
or
not
we
are
all
ready
to
acknowledge
that
household
labor
has
been
in
some
way
belated
that
the
improvements
there
have
not
kept
up
with
the
improvement
in
other
occupations
it
is
said
that
the
last
revolution
in
the
processes
of
cooking
was
brought
about
by
count
rumford
who
died
a
hundred
years
ago
this
is
largely
due
to
the
lack
of
de
among
the
employees
which
keeps
them
collectively
from
fresh
achievements
as
the
absence
of
education
in
the
individual
keeps
her
from
improving
her
implements
under
this
isolation
not
only
must
one
set
of
utensils
serve
divers
purposes
and
as
a
consequence
tend
to
a
lessened
volume
and
lower
quality
of
work
but
inasmuch
as
the
appliances
are
not
made
to
perform
the
fullest
work
there
is
an
amount
of
capital
invested
disproportionate
to
the
product
when
measured
by
the
achievement
in
other
branches
of
industry
more
important
than
this
is
the
result
of
the
isolation
upon
the
worker
herself
there
is
nothing
more
devastating
to
the
inventive
faculty
nor
fatal
to
a
flow
of
mind
and
spirit
than
the
constant
feeling
of
loneliness
and
the
absence
of
that
fellowship
which
makes
our
public
opinion
if
an
angry
foreman
reprimands
a
girl
for
breaking
a
machine
twenty
other
girls
hear
him
and
the
culprit
knows
perfectly
well
their
opinion
as
to
the
justice
or
injustice
of
her
situation
in
either
case
she
bears
it
better
for
knowing
that
and
not
thinking
it
over
in
solitude
if
a
household
employee
breaks
a
utensil
or
a
piece
of
porcelain
and
is
reprimanded
by
her
employer
too
often
the
invisible
jury
is
the
family
of
the
latter
who
naturally
uphold
her
censorious
position
and
intensify
the
feeling
of
loneliness
in
the
employee
the
household
employee
in
addition
to
her
industrial
isolation
is
also
isolated
socially
it
is
well
to
remember
that
the
household
employees
for
the
better
quarters
of
the
city
and
suburbs
are
largely
drawn
from
the
poorer
quarters
which
are
nothing
if
not
gregarious
the
girl
is
born
and
reared
in
a
tenement
house
full
of
children
she
goes
to
school
with
them
and
there
she
learns
to
march
to
read
and
write
in
companionship
with
forty
others
when
she
is
old
enough
to
go
to
parties
those
she
attends
are
usually
held
in
a
public
hall
and
are
crowded
with
dancers
if
she
works
in
a
factory
she
walks
home
with
many
other
girls
in
much
the
same
spirit
as
she
formerly
walked
to
school
with
them
she
mingles
with
the
young
men
she
knows
in
frank
economic
and
social
equality
until
she
marries
she
remains
at
home
with
no
special
break
or
change
in
her
family
and
social
life
if
she
is
employed
in
a
household
this
is
not
true
suddenly
all
the
conditions
of
her
life
are
altered
this
change
may
be
wholesome
for
her
but
it
is
not
easy
and
thought
of
the
does
not
cheer
one
much
when
one
is
twenty
she
is
isolated
from
the
people
with
whom
she
has
been
reared
with
whom
she
has
gone
to
school
and
among
whom
she
expects
to
live
when
she
marries
she
is
naturally
lonely
and
constrained
away
from
them
and
the
new
maid
often
seems
queer
to
her
employer
family
she
does
not
care
to
mingle
socially
with
the
people
in
whose
house
she
is
employed
as
the
girl
from
the
country
often
does
but
she
surfers
horribly
from
loneliness
this
wholesome
instinctive
dread
of
social
isolation
is
so
strong
that
as
every
city
can
testify
the
filling
of
situations
is
easier
or
more
difficult
in
proportion
as
the
place
offers
more
or
less
companionship
thus
the
easy
situation
to
fill
is
always
the
city
house
with
five
or
six
employees
shading
off
into
the
more
difficult
suburban
home
with
two
and
the
utterly
impossible
lonely
country
house
there
are
suburban
employers
of
household
labor
who
make
heroic
efforts
to
supply
domestic
and
social
life
to
their
employees
who
take
the
domestic
employee
to
drive
arrange
to
have
her
invited
out
occasionally
who
supply
her
with
books
and
papers
and
companionship
nothing
could
be
more
praiseworthy
in
motive
but
it
is
seldom
successful
in
actual
operation
resulting
as
it
does
in
a
simulacrum
of
companionship
the
employee
may
have
a
genuine
friendship
for
her
employer
and
a
pleasure
in
her
companionship
or
she
may
not
have
and
the
unnaturalness
of
the
situation
comes
from
the
insistence
that
she
has
merely
because
of
the
propinquity
the
unnaturalness
of
the
situation
is
intensified
by
the
fact
that
the
employee
is
practically
debarred
by
distance
and
lack
of
leisure
from
her
natural
associates
and
that
her
employer
sympathetically
insists
upon
filling
the
vacancy
in
interests
and
affections
by
her
own
tastes
and
friendship
she
may
or
may
not
succeed
but
the
employee
should
not
be
thus
dependent
upon
the
good
will
of
her
employer
that
in
itself
is
undemocratic
the
difficulty
is
increasing
by
a
sense
of
social
discrimination
which
the
household
employee
keenly
feels
is
against
her
and
in
favor
of
the
factory
girls
in
the
minds
of
the
young
men
of
her
acquaintance
women
seeking
employment
understand
perfectly
well
this
feeling
among
mechanics
doubtless
quite
unjustifiable
but
it
acts
as
a
strong
inducement
toward
factory
labor
the
writer
has
long
ceased
to
apologize
for
the
views
and
opinions
of
working
people
being
quite
sure
that
on
the
whole
they
are
quite
as
wise
and
quite
as
foolish
as
the
views
and
opinions
of
other
people
but
that
this
particularly
foolish
opinion
of
young
mechanics
is
widely
shared
by
the
employing
class
can
be
easily
demonstrated
the
contrast
is
further
accentuated
by
the
better
social
position
of
the
factory
girl
and
the
advantages
provided
for
her
in
the
way
of
lunch
clubs
social
clubs
and
vacation
homes
from
which
girls
performing
household
labor
are
practically
excluded
by
their
hours
of
work
their
geographical
situation
and
a
curious
feeling
that
they
are
not
as
interesting
as
factory
girls
this
separation
from
her
natural
social
ties
affects
of
course
her
opportunity
for
family
life
it
is
well
to
remember
that
women
as
a
rule
are
devoted
to
their
families
that
they
want
to
live
with
their
parents
their
brothers
and
sisters
and
kinsfolk
and
will
sacrifice
much
to
accomplish
this
this
devotion
is
so
universal
that
it
is
impossible
to
ignore
it
when
we
consider
women
as
employees
young
unmarried
women
are
not
detached
from
family
claims
and
requirements
as
young
men
are
and
are
more
ready
and
steady
in
their
response
to
the
needs
of
aged
parents
and
the
helpless
members
of
the
family
but
women
performing
labor
in
households
have
peculiar
difficulties
in
responding
to
their
family
claims
and
are
practically
dependent
upon
their
employers
for
opportunities
of
even
seeing
their
relatives
and
friends
curiously
enough
the
same
devotion
to
family
life
and
quick
response
to
its
claims
on
the
part
of
the
employer
operates
against
the
girl
employed
in
household
labor
and
still
further
contributes
to
her
isolation
the
employer
of
household
labor
in
her
zeal
to
preserve
her
own
family
life
intact
and
free
from
intrusion
acts
inconsistently
and
grants
to
her
cook
for
instance
but
once
or
twice
a
week
such
opportunity
for
untrammelled
association
with
her
relatives
as
the
employer
family
claims
constantly
this
in
itself
is
undemocratic
in
that
it
makes
a
distinction
between
the
value
of
family
life
for
one
set
of
people
as
over
against
another
or
rather
claims
that
one
set
of
people
are
of
so
much
less
importance
than
another
that
a
valuable
side
of
life
pertaining
to
them
should
be
sacrificed
for
the
other
this
can
not
be
defended
theoretically
and
no
doubt
much
of
the
talk
among
the
employers
of
household
labor
that
their
employees
are
carefully
shielded
and
cared
for
and
that
it
is
so
much
better
for
a
girl
health
and
morals
to
work
in
a
household
than
to
work
in
a
factory
comes
from
a
certain
uneasiness
of
conscience
and
from
a
desire
to
make
up
by
individual
scruple
what
would
be
done
much
more
freely
and
naturally
by
public
opinion
if
it
had
an
untrammelled
chance
to
assert
itself
one
person
or
a
number
of
isolated
persons
however
conscientious
can
not
perform
this
office
of
public
opinion
certain
hospitals
in
london
have
contributed
statistics
showing
that
per
cent
of
illegitimate
children
born
there
are
the
children
of
girls
working
in
households
these
girls
are
certainly
not
less
virtuous
than
factory
girls
for
they
come
from
the
same
families
and
have
had
the
same
training
but
the
girls
who
remain
at
home
and
work
in
factories
meet
their
lovers
naturally
and
easily
their
fathers
and
brothers
know
the
men
and
unconsciously
exercise
a
certain
supervision
and
a
certain
direction
in
their
choice
of
companionship
the
household
employees
living
in
another
part
of
the
city
away
from
their
natural
family
and
social
ties
depend
upon
chance
for
the
lovers
whom
they
meet
the
lover
may
be
the
young
man
who
delivers
for
the
butcher
or
grocer
or
the
solitary
friend
who
follows
the
girl
from
her
own
part
of
town
and
pursues
unfairly
the
advantage
which
her
social
loneliness
and
isolation
afford
him
there
is
no
available
public
opinion
nor
any
standard
of
convention
which
the
girl
can
apply
to
her
own
situation
it
would
be
easy
to
point
out
many
inconveniences
arising
from
the
fact
that
the
old
economic
forms
are
retained
when
moral
conditions
which
befitted
them
have
entirely
disappeared
but
until
employers
of
domestic
labor
become
conscious
of
their
narrow
code
of
ethics
and
make
a
distinct
effort
to
break
through
the
status
of
mistress
and
servant
because
it
shocks
their
moral
sense
there
is
no
chance
of
even
beginning
a
reform
a
fuller
social
and
domestic
life
among
household
employees
would
be
steps
toward
securing
their
entrance
into
the
larger
industrial
organizations
by
which
the
needs
of
a
community
are
most
successfully
administered
many
a
girl
who
complains
of
loneliness
and
who
relinquishes
her
situation
with
that
as
her
sole
excuse
feebly
tries
to
formulate
her
sense
of
restraint
and
social
she
sometimes
says
that
she
feels
so
unnatural
all
the
time
the
writer
has
known
the
voice
of
a
girl
to
change
so
much
during
three
weeks
of
service
that
she
could
not
recognize
it
when
the
girl
returned
to
her
home
it
alternated
between
the
high
falsetto
in
which
a
shy
child
speaks
a
piece
and
the
husky
gulp
with
which
the
is
swallowed
the
alertness
and
of
the
voice
of
the
child
had
totally
disappeared
when
such
a
girl
leaves
her
employer
her
reasons
are
often
incoherent
and
totally
incomprehensible
to
that
good
lady
who
naturally
concludes
that
she
wishes
to
get
away
from
the
work
and
back
to
her
dances
and
giddy
life
content
if
she
has
these
to
stand
many
hours
in
an
insanitary
factory
the
charge
of
the
employer
is
only
half
a
truth
these
dances
may
be
the
only
organized
form
of
social
life
which
the
disheartened
employee
is
able
to
mention
but
the
girl
herself
in
her
discontent
and
her
moving
from
place
to
place
is
blindly
striving
to
respond
to
a
larger
social
life
her
employer
thinks
that
she
should
be
able
to
consider
only
the
interests
and
conveniences
of
her
employer
family
because
the
employer
herself
is
holding
to
a
family
outlook
and
refuses
to
allow
her
mind
to
take
in
the
larger
aspects
of
the
situation
although
this
household
industry
survives
in
the
midst
of
the
factory
system
it
must
of
course
constantly
compete
with
it
women
with
little
children
or
those
with
invalids
depending
upon
them
can
not
enter
either
occupation
and
they
are
practically
confined
to
the
sewing
trades
but
to
all
other
untrained
women
seeking
employment
a
choice
is
open
between
these
two
forms
of
labor
there
are
few
women
so
dull
that
they
can
not
paste
labels
on
a
box
or
do
some
form
of
factory
work
few
so
dull
that
some
perplexed
housekeeper
will
not
receive
them
at
least
for
a
trial
in
her
household
household
labor
then
has
to
compete
with
factory
labor
and
women
seeking
employment
more
or
less
consciously
compare
these
two
forms
of
labor
in
point
of
hours
in
point
of
permanency
of
employment
in
point
of
wages
and
in
point
of
the
advantage
they
afford
for
family
and
social
life
three
points
are
easily
disposed
of
first
in
regard
to
hours
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
factory
has
the
advantage
the
average
factory
hours
are
from
seven
in
the
morning
to
six
in
the
evening
with
the
chance
of
working
overtime
in
busy
seasons
this
leaves
most
of
the
evenings
and
sundays
entirely
free
the
average
hours
of
household
labor
are
from
six
in
the
morning
until
eight
at
night
with
little
difference
in
seasons
there
is
one
afternoon
a
week
with
an
occasional
evening
but
sunday
is
seldom
wholly
free
even
these
evenings
and
afternoons
take
the
form
of
a
concession
from
the
employer
they
are
called
evenings
out
as
if
the
time
really
belonged
to
her
but
that
she
was
graciously
permitting
her
employee
to
use
it
this
attitude
of
course
is
in
marked
contrast
to
that
maintained
by
the
factory
operative
who
when
she
works
evenings
is
paid
for
second
in
regard
to
permanency
of
position
the
advantage
is
found
clearly
on
the
side
of
the
household
employee
if
she
proves
in
any
measure
satisfactory
to
her
employer
for
she
encounters
much
less
competition
third
in
point
of
wages
the
household
is
again
fairly
ahead
if
we
consider
not
the
money
received
but
the
opportunity
offered
for
saving
money
this
is
greater
among
household
employees
because
they
do
not
pay
board
the
clothing
required
is
simpler
and
the
temptation
to
spend
money
in
recreation
is
less
frequent
the
minimum
wages
paid
an
adult
in
household
labor
may
be
fairly
put
at
two
dollars
and
a
half
a
week
the
maximum
at
six
dollars
this
excluding
the
comparatively
rare
opportunities
for
women
to
cook
at
forty
dollars
a
month
and
the
housekeeper
position
at
fifty
dollars
a
month
the
factory
wages
viewed
from
the
point
of
view
may
be
smaller
in
the
average
but
this
is
doubtless
counterbalanced
in
the
minds
of
the
employees
by
the
greater
chance
which
the
factory
offers
for
increased
wages
a
girl
over
sixteen
seldom
works
in
a
factory
for
less
than
four
dollars
a
week
and
always
cherishes
the
hope
of
at
last
being
a
forewoman
with
a
permanent
salary
of
from
fifteen
to
dollars
a
week
whether
she
attains
this
or
not
she
runs
a
fair
chance
of
earning
ten
dollars
a
week
as
a
skilled
worker
a
girl
finds
it
easier
to
be
content
with
three
dollars
a
week
when
she
pays
for
board
in
a
scale
of
wages
rising
toward
ten
dollars
than
to
be
content
with
four
dollars
a
week
and
pay
no
board
in
a
scale
of
wages
rising
toward
six
dollars
and
the
girl
well
knows
that
there
are
scores
of
forewomen
at
sixty
dollars
a
month
for
one
cook
or
housekeeper
in
many
cases
this
position
is
well
taken
economically
for
although
the
opportunity
for
saving
may
be
better
for
the
employees
in
the
household
than
in
the
factory
her
family
saves
more
when
she
works
in
a
factory
and
lives
with
them
the
rent
is
no
more
when
she
is
at
home
the
two
dollars
and
a
half
a
week
which
she
pays
into
the
family
fund
more
than
covers
the
cost
of
her
actual
food
and
at
night
she
can
often
contribute
toward
the
family
labor
by
helping
her
mother
wash
and
sew
the
fourth
point
has
already
been
considered
and
if
the
premise
in
regard
to
the
isolation
of
the
household
employee
is
well
taken
and
if
the
position
can
be
sustained
that
this
isolation
proves
the
determining
factor
in
the
situation
then
certainly
an
effort
should
be
made
to
remedy
this
at
least
in
its
domestic
and
social
aspects
to
allow
household
employees
to
live
with
their
own
families
and
among
their
own
friends
as
factory
employees
now
do
would
be
to
relegate
more
production
to
industrial
centres
administered
on
the
factory
system
and
to
secure
shorter
hours
for
that
which
remains
to
be
done
in
the
household
in
those
cases
in
which
the
household
employees
have
no
family
ties
doubtless
a
remedy
against
social
isolation
would
be
the
formation
of
residence
clubs
at
least
in
the
suburbs
where
the
isolation
is
most
keenly
felt
indeed
the
beginnings
of
these
clubs
are
already
seen
in
the
servants
quarters
at
the
summer
hotels
in
these
residence
clubs
the
household
employee
could
have
the
independent
life
which
only
own
abiding
place
can
afford
this
of
course
presupposes
a
higher
grade
of
ability
than
household
employees
at
present
possess
on
the
other
hand
it
is
only
by
offering
such
possibilities
that
the
higher
grades
of
intelligence
can
be
secured
for
household
employment
as
the
plan
of
separate
clubs
for
household
employees
will
probably
come
first
in
the
suburbs
where
the
difficulty
of
securing
and
holding
servants
under
the
present
system
is
most
keenly
felt
so
the
plan
of
buying
cooked
food
from
an
outside
kitchen
and
of
having
more
and
more
of
the
household
product
relegated
to
the
factory
will
probably
come
from
the
comparatively
poor
people
in
the
city
who
feel
most
keenly
the
pressure
of
the
present
system
they
already
consume
a
much
larger
proportion
of
canned
goods
and
bakers
wares
and
prepared
meats
than
the
more
prosperous
people
do
because
they
can
not
command
the
skill
nor
the
time
for
the
more
tedious
preparation
of
the
raw
material
the
writer
has
seen
a
mother
pass
by
a
basket
of
green
peas
at
the
door
of
a
local
grocery
store
to
purchase
a
tin
of
canned
peas
because
they
could
be
easily
prepared
for
supper
and
the
children
liked
the
tinny
taste
it
is
comparatively
easy
for
an
employer
to
manage
her
household
industry
with
a
cook
a
laundress
a
waitress
the
difficulties
really
begin
when
the
family
income
is
so
small
that
but
one
person
can
be
employed
in
the
household
for
all
these
varied
functions
and
the
difficulties
increase
and
grow
almost
insurmountable
as
they
fall
altogether
upon
the
mother
of
the
family
who
is
living
in
a
flat
or
worse
still
in
a
tenement
house
where
one
stove
and
one
set
of
utensils
must
be
put
to
all
sorts
of
uses
fit
or
unfit
making
the
living
room
of
the
family
a
horror
in
summer
and
perfectly
insupportable
on
rainy
in
winter
such
a
woman
rather
than
the
prosperous
housekeeper
uses
factory
products
and
thus
no
high
standard
of
quality
is
established
the
problem
of
domestic
service
which
has
long
been
discussed
in
the
united
states
and
england
is
now
coming
to
prominence
in
france
as
a
economist
has
recently
pointed
out
the
large
defection
in
the
ranks
of
domestics
is
there
regarded
as
a
sign
of
revolt
against
an
unconscious
slavery
while
english
and
american
writers
appeal
to
the
statistics
which
point
to
the
absorption
of
an
enormous
number
of
the
class
from
which
servants
were
formerly
recruited
into
factory
employments
and
urge
as
the
natural
solution
that
more
of
the
products
used
in
households
be
manufactured
in
factories
and
that
personal
service
at
least
for
healthy
adults
be
eliminated
altogether
both
of
these
lines
of
discussion
certainly
indicate
that
domestic
service
is
yielding
to
the
influence
of
a
democratic
movement
and
is
emerging
from
the
narrower
code
of
family
ethics
into
the
larger
code
governing
social
relations
it
still
remains
to
express
the
ethical
advance
through
changed
economic
conditions
by
which
the
actual
needs
of
the
family
may
be
supplied
not
only
more
effectively
but
more
in
line
with
associated
effort
to
fail
to
apprehend
the
tendency
of
one
age
and
to
fail
to
adapt
the
conditions
of
an
industry
to
it
is
to
leave
that
industry
and
belated
on
the
economic
side
and
out
of
line
ethically
chapter
v
industrial
amelioration
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
great
difficulty
we
experience
in
reducing
to
action
our
imperfect
code
of
social
ethics
arises
from
the
fact
that
we
have
not
yet
learned
to
act
together
and
find
it
far
from
easy
even
to
fuse
our
principles
and
aims
into
a
satisfactory
statement
we
have
all
been
at
times
entertained
by
the
futile
efforts
of
half
a
dozen
highly
individualized
people
gathered
together
as
a
committee
their
aimless
attempts
to
find
a
common
method
of
action
have
recalled
the
wavering
motion
of
a
baby
arm
before
he
has
learned
to
coördinate
his
muscles
if
as
is
many
times
stated
we
are
passing
from
an
age
of
individualism
to
one
of
association
there
is
no
doubt
that
for
decisive
and
effective
action
the
individual
still
has
the
best
of
it
he
will
secure
efficient
results
while
committees
are
still
deliberating
upon
the
best
method
of
making
a
beginning
and
yet
if
the
need
of
the
times
demand
associated
effort
it
may
easily
be
true
that
the
action
which
appears
ineffective
and
yet
is
carried
out
upon
the
more
highly
developed
line
of
associated
effort
may
represent
a
finer
social
quality
and
have
a
greater
social
value
than
the
more
effective
individual
action
it
is
possible
that
an
individual
may
be
successful
largely
because
he
conserves
all
his
powers
for
individual
achievement
and
does
not
put
any
of
his
energy
into
the
training
which
will
give
him
the
ability
to
act
with
others
the
individual
acts
promptly
and
we
are
dazzled
by
his
success
while
only
dimly
conscious
of
the
inadequacy
of
his
code
nowhere
is
this
illustrated
more
clearly
than
in
industrial
relations
as
existing
between
the
owner
of
a
large
factory
and
his
employees
a
growing
conflict
may
be
detected
between
the
democratic
ideal
which
urges
the
workmen
to
demand
representation
in
the
administration
of
industry
and
the
accepted
position
that
the
man
who
owns
the
capital
and
takes
the
risks
has
the
exclusive
right
of
management
it
is
in
reality
a
clash
between
individual
or
aristocratic
management
and
corporate
or
democratic
management
a
large
and
highly
developed
factory
presents
a
sharp
contrast
between
its
socialized
form
and
individualistic
ends
it
is
possible
to
illustrate
this
difference
by
a
series
of
events
which
occurred
in
chicago
during
the
summer
of
these
events
epitomized
and
exaggerated
but
at
the
same
time
challenged
the
code
of
ethics
which
regulates
much
of
our
daily
conduct
and
clearly
showed
that
social
relations
are
often
resting
upon
the
will
of
an
individual
and
are
in
reality
regulated
by
a
code
of
individual
ethics
as
this
situation
illustrates
a
point
of
great
difficulty
to
which
we
have
arrived
in
our
development
of
social
ethics
it
may
be
justifiable
to
discuss
it
at
some
length
let
us
recall
the
facts
not
as
they
have
been
investigated
and
printed
but
as
they
remain
in
our
memories
a
large
manufacturing
company
had
provided
commodious
workshops
and
at
the
instigation
of
its
president
had
built
a
model
town
for
the
use
of
its
employees
after
a
series
of
years
it
was
deemed
necessary
during
a
financial
depression
to
reduce
the
wages
of
these
employees
by
giving
each
workman
less
than
work
in
order
to
keep
the
shops
open
this
reduction
was
not
accepted
by
the
men
who
had
become
discontented
with
the
factory
management
and
the
town
regulations
and
a
strike
ensued
followed
by
a
complete
of
the
works
although
these
shops
were
shops
the
strikers
were
hastily
organized
and
appealed
for
help
to
the
american
railway
union
which
at
that
moment
was
holding
its
biennial
meeting
in
chicago
after
some
days
discussion
and
some
futile
attempts
at
arbitration
a
sympathetic
strike
was
declared
which
gradually
involved
railway
men
in
all
parts
of
the
country
and
orderly
transportation
was
brought
to
a
complete
standstill
in
the
excitement
which
followed
cars
were
burned
and
tracks
torn
up
the
police
of
chicago
did
not
cope
with
the
disorder
and
the
railway
companies
apparently
distrusting
the
governor
of
the
state
and
in
order
to
protect
the
united
states
mails
called
upon
the
president
of
the
united
states
for
the
federal
troops
the
federal
courts
further
enjoined
all
persons
against
any
form
of
interference
with
the
property
or
operation
of
the
railroads
and
the
situation
gradually
assumed
the
proportions
of
internecine
warfare
during
all
of
these
events
the
president
of
the
manufacturing
company
first
involved
steadfastly
refused
to
have
the
situation
submitted
to
arbitration
and
this
attitude
naturally
provoked
much
discussion
the
discussion
was
broadly
divided
between
those
who
held
that
the
long
kindness
of
the
president
of
the
company
had
been
most
ungratefully
received
and
those
who
maintained
that
the
situation
was
the
inevitable
outcome
of
the
social
consciousness
developing
among
working
people
the
first
defended
the
president
of
the
company
in
his
persistent
refusal
to
arbitrate
maintaining
that
arbitration
was
impossible
after
the
matter
had
been
taken
up
by
other
than
his
own
employees
and
they
declared
that
a
man
must
be
allowed
to
run
his
own
business
they
considered
the
firm
stand
of
the
president
a
service
to
the
manufacturing
interests
of
the
entire
country
the
others
claimed
that
a
large
manufacturing
concern
has
ceased
to
be
a
private
matter
that
not
only
a
number
of
workmen
and
stockholders
are
concerned
in
its
management
but
that
the
interests
of
the
public
are
so
involved
that
the
officers
of
the
company
are
in
a
real
sense
administering
a
public
trust
this
prolonged
strike
clearly
puts
in
a
concrete
form
the
ethics
of
an
individual
in
this
case
a
benevolent
employer
and
the
ethics
of
a
mass
of
men
his
employees
claiming
what
they
believed
to
be
their
moral
rights
these
events
illustrate
the
difficulty
of
managing
an
industry
which
has
become
organized
into
a
vast
social
operation
not
with
the
coöperation
of
the
workman
thus
socialized
but
solely
by
the
dictation
of
the
individual
owning
the
capital
there
is
a
sharp
divergence
between
the
social
form
and
the
individual
aim
which
becomes
greater
as
the
employees
are
more
highly
socialized
and
dependent
the
president
of
the
company
under
discussion
went
further
than
the
usual
employer
does
he
socialized
not
only
the
factory
but
the
form
in
which
his
workmen
were
living
he
built
and
in
a
great
measure
regulated
an
entire
town
without
calling
upon
the
workmen
either
for
or
he
honestly
believed
that
he
knew
better
than
they
what
was
for
their
good
as
he
certainly
knew
better
than
they
how
to
conduct
his
business
as
his
factory
developed
and
increased
making
money
each
year
under
his
direction
he
naturally
expected
the
town
to
prosper
in
the
same
way
he
did
not
realize
that
the
men
submitted
to
the
undemocratic
conditions
of
the
factory
organization
because
the
economic
pressure
in
our
industrial
affairs
is
so
great
that
they
could
not
do
otherwise
under
this
pressure
they
could
be
successfully
discouraged
from
organization
and
systematically
treated
on
the
individual
basis
social
life
however
in
spite
of
class
distinctions
is
much
freer
than
industrial
life
and
the
men
resented
the
extension
of
industrial
control
to
domestic
and
social
arrangements
they
felt
the
lack
of
democracy
in
the
assumption
that
they
should
be
taken
care
of
in
these
matters
in
which
even
the
humblest
workman
has
won
his
independence
the
basic
difficulty
lay
in
the
fact
that
an
individual
was
directing
the
social
affairs
of
many
men
without
any
consistent
effort
to
find
out
their
desires
and
without
any
organization
through
which
to
give
them
social
expression
the
president
of
the
company
was
moreover
so
confident
of
the
righteousness
of
his
aim
that
he
had
come
to
test
the
righteousness
of
the
process
by
his
own
feelings
and
not
by
those
of
the
men
he
doubtless
built
the
town
from
a
sincere
desire
to
give
his
employees
the
best
surroundings
as
it
developed
he
gradually
took
toward
it
the
artist
attitude
toward
his
own
creation
which
has
no
thought
for
the
creation
itself
but
is
absorbed
in
the
idea
it
stands
for
and
he
ceased
to
measure
the
usefulness
of
the
town
by
the
standard
of
the
men
needs
this
process
slowly
darkened
his
glints
of
memory
which
might
have
connected
his
experience
with
that
of
his
men
it
is
possible
to
cultivate
the
impulses
of
the
benefactor
until
the
power
of
attaining
a
simple
human
relationship
with
the
beneficiaries
that
of
frank
equality
with
them
is
gone
and
there
is
left
no
mutual
interest
in
a
common
cause
to
perform
too
many
good
deeds
may
be
to
lose
the
power
of
recognizing
good
in
others
to
be
too
absorbed
in
carrying
out
a
personal
plan
of
improvement
may
be
to
fail
to
catch
the
great
moral
lesson
which
our
times
offer
the
president
of
this
company
fostered
his
employees
for
many
years
he
gave
them
sanitary
houses
and
beautiful
parks
but
in
their
extreme
need
when
they
were
struggling
with
the
most
difficult
situation
which
the
times
could
present
to
them
he
lost
his
touch
and
had
nothing
wherewith
to
help
them
the
employer
conception
of
goodness
for
his
men
had
been
cleanliness
decency
of
living
and
above
all
thrift
and
temperance
means
had
been
provided
for
all
this
and
opportunities
had
also
been
given
for
recreation
and
improvement
but
this
employer
suddenly
found
his
town
in
the
sweep
of
a
moral
impulse
a
movement
had
been
going
on
about
him
and
among
his
working
men
of
which
he
had
been
unconscious
or
concerning
which
he
had
heard
only
by
rumor
outside
the
ken
of
philanthropists
the
proletariat
had
learned
to
say
in
many
languages
that
the
injury
of
one
is
the
concern
of
all
their
watchwords
were
brotherhood
sacrifice
the
subordination
of
individual
and
trade
interests
to
the
good
of
the
working
classes
and
they
were
moved
by
a
determination
to
free
that
class
from
the
untoward
conditions
under
which
they
were
laboring
compared
to
these
watchwords
the
old
ones
which
this
philanthropic
employer
had
given
his
town
were
negative
and
inadequate
he
had
believed
strongly
in
temperance
and
steadiness
of
individual
effort
but
had
failed
to
apprehend
the
greater
movement
of
combined
abstinence
and
concerted
action
with
all
his
fostering
the
president
had
not
attained
to
a
conception
of
social
morality
for
his
men
and
had
imagined
that
virtue
for
them
largely
meant
absence
of
vice
when
the
labor
movement
finally
stirred
his
town
or
to
speak
more
fairly
when
in
their
distress
and
perplexity
his
own
employees
appealed
to
an
organized
manifestation
of
this
movement
they
were
quite
sure
that
simply
because
they
were
workmen
in
distress
they
would
not
be
deserted
by
it
this
loyalty
on
the
part
of
a
widely
ramified
and
union
toward
the
workmen
in
a
shop
who
had
contributed
nothing
to
its
cause
was
certainly
a
manifestation
of
moral
power
in
none
of
his
utterances
or
correspondence
did
the
president
for
an
instant
recognize
this
touch
of
nobility
although
one
would
imagine
that
he
would
gladly
point
out
this
bit
of
virtue
in
what
he
must
have
considered
the
moral
ruin
about
him
he
stood
throughout
for
the
individual
virtues
those
which
had
distinguished
the
model
workmen
of
his
youth
those
which
had
enabled
him
and
so
many
of
his
contemporaries
to
rise
in
life
when
rising
in
life
was
urged
upon
every
promising
boy
as
the
goal
of
his
efforts
of
the
code
of
social
ethics
he
had
caught
absolutely
nothing
the
morals
he
had
advocated
in
selecting
and
training
his
men
did
not
fail
them
in
the
hour
of
confusion
they
were
and
they
themselves
destroyed
no
property
they
were
sober
and
exhibited
no
drunkenness
even
although
obliged
to
hold
their
meetings
in
the
saloon
hall
of
a
neighboring
town
they
repaid
their
employer
in
kind
but
he
had
given
them
no
rule
for
the
life
of
association
into
which
they
were
plunged
the
president
of
the
company
desired
that
his
employees
should
possess
the
individual
and
family
virtues
but
did
nothing
to
cherish
in
them
the
social
virtues
which
express
themselves
in
associated
effort
day
after
day
during
that
horrible
time
of
suspense
when
the
wires
constantly
reported
the
same
message
the
president
of
the
company
holds
that
there
is
nothing
to
arbitrate
one
was
forced
to
feel
that
the
ideal
of
rule
was
being
sustained
in
its
baldest
form
a
demand
from
many
parts
of
the
country
and
from
many
people
was
being
made
for
social
adjustment
against
which
the
commercial
training
and
the
individualistic
point
of
view
held
its
own
successfully
the
majority
of
the
stockholders
not
only
of
this
company
but
of
similar
companies
and
many
other
citizens
who
had
had
the
same
commercial
experience
shared
and
sustained
this
position
it
was
quite
impossible
for
them
to
catch
the
other
point
of
view
they
not
only
felt
themselves
right
from
the
commercial
standpoint
but
had
gradually
accustomed
themselves
also
to
the
philanthropic
standpoint
until
they
had
come
to
consider
their
motives
beyond
reproach
habit
held
them
persistent
in
this
view
of
the
case
through
all
changing
conditions
a
wise
man
has
said
that
the
consent
of
men
and
your
own
conscience
are
two
wings
given
you
whereby
you
may
rise
to
god
it
is
so
easy
for
the
good
and
powerful
to
think
that
they
can
rise
by
following
the
dictates
of
conscience
by
pursuing
their
own
ideals
that
they
are
prone
to
leave
those
ideals
unconnected
with
the
consent
of
their
the
president
of
the
company
thought
out
within
his
own
mind
a
beautiful
town
he
had
power
with
which
to
build
this
town
but
he
did
not
appeal
to
nor
obtain
the
consent
of
the
men
who
were
living
in
it
the
most
unambitious
reform
recognizing
the
necessity
for
this
consent
makes
for
slow
but
sane
and
strenuous
progress
while
the
most
ambitious
of
social
plans
and
experiments
ignoring
this
is
prone
to
failure
the
man
who
insists
upon
consent
who
moves
with
the
people
is
bound
to
consult
the
feasible
right
as
well
as
the
absolute
right
he
is
often
obliged
to
attain
only
lincoln
best
possible
and
then
has
the
sickening
sense
of
compromise
with
his
best
convictions
he
has
to
move
along
with
those
whom
he
leads
toward
a
goal
that
neither
he
nor
they
see
very
clearly
till
they
come
to
it
he
has
to
discover
what
people
really
want
and
then
provide
the
channels
in
which
the
growing
moral
force
of
their
lives
shall
flow
what
he
does
attain
however
is
not
the
result
of
his
individual
striving
as
a
solitary
beyond
that
of
the
valley
multitude
but
it
is
sustained
and
upheld
by
the
sentiments
and
aspirations
of
many
others
progress
has
been
slower
perpendicularly
but
incomparably
greater
because
lateral
he
has
not
taught
his
contemporaries
to
climb
mountains
but
he
has
persuaded
the
villagers
to
move
up
a
few
feet
higher
added
to
this
he
has
made
secure
his
progress
a
few
months
after
the
death
of
the
promoter
of
this
model
town
a
court
decision
made
it
obligatory
upon
the
company
to
divest
itself
of
the
management
of
the
town
as
involving
a
function
beyond
its
corporate
powers
the
parks
flowers
and
fountains
of
this
industrial
centre
were
dismantled
with
scarcely
a
protest
from
the
inhabitants
themselves
the
man
who
disassociates
his
ambition
however
disinterested
from
the
coöperation
of
his
fellows
always
takes
this
risk
of
ultimate
failure
he
does
not
take
advantage
of
the
great
conserver
and
guarantee
of
his
own
permanent
success
which
associated
efforts
afford
genuine
experiments
toward
higher
social
conditions
must
have
a
more
democratic
faith
and
practice
than
those
which
underlie
private
venture
public
parks
and
improvements
intended
for
the
common
use
are
after
all
only
safe
in
the
hands
of
the
public
itself
and
associated
effort
toward
social
progress
although
much
more
awkward
and
stumbling
than
that
same
effort
managed
by
a
capable
individual
does
yet
enlist
deeper
forces
and
evoke
higher
social
capacities
the
successful
business
man
who
is
also
the
philanthropist
is
in
more
than
the
usual
danger
of
getting
widely
separated
from
his
employees
the
men
already
have
the
american
veneration
for
wealth
and
successful
business
capacity
and
added
to
this
they
are
dazzled
by
his
good
works
the
workmen
have
the
same
kindly
impulses
as
he
but
while
they
organize
their
charity
into
mutual
benefit
associations
and
distribute
their
money
in
small
amounts
in
relief
for
the
widows
and
insurance
for
the
injured
the
employer
may
build
model
towns
erect
college
buildings
which
are
tangible
and
enduring
and
thereby
display
his
goodness
in
concentrated
form
by
the
very
exigencies
of
business
demands
the
employer
is
too
often
cut
off
from
the
social
ethics
developing
in
regard
to
our
larger
social
relationships
and
from
the
great
moral
life
springing
from
our
common
experiences
this
is
sure
to
happen
when
he
is
good
to
people
rather
than
with
them
when
he
allows
himself
to
decide
what
is
best
for
them
instead
of
consulting
them
he
thus
misses
the
rectifying
influence
of
that
fellowship
which
is
so
big
that
it
leaves
no
room
for
sensitiveness
or
gratitude
without
this
fellowship
we
may
never
know
how
great
the
divergence
between
ourselves
and
others
may
become
nor
how
cruel
the
misunderstandings
during
a
recent
strike
of
the
employees
of
a
large
factory
in
ohio
the
president
of
the
company
expressed
himself
as
bitterly
disappointed
by
the
results
of
his
many
kindnesses
and
evidently
considered
the
employees
utterly
unappreciative
his
state
of
mind
was
the
result
of
the
fallacy
of
ministering
to
social
needs
from
an
individual
impulse
and
expecting
a
socialized
return
of
gratitude
and
loyalty
if
the
was
necessary
it
was
a
necessity
in
order
that
the
employees
might
have
better
food
and
when
they
had
received
the
better
food
the
legitimate
aim
of
the
was
met
if
baths
were
desirable
and
the
fifteen
minutes
of
calisthenic
exercise
given
the
women
in
the
middle
of
each
half
day
brought
a
needed
rest
and
change
to
their
muscles
then
the
increased
cleanliness
and
the
increased
bodily
comfort
of
so
many
people
should
of
themselves
have
justified
the
experiment
to
demand
as
a
further
result
that
there
should
be
no
strikes
in
the
factory
no
revolt
against
the
will
of
the
employer
because
the
employees
were
filled
with
loyalty
as
the
result
of
the
kindness
was
of
course
to
take
the
experiment
from
an
individual
basis
to
a
social
one
large
mining
companies
and
manufacturing
concerns
are
constantly
appealing
to
their
stockholders
for
funds
or
for
permission
to
take
a
percentage
of
the
profits
in
order
that
the
money
may
be
used
for
educational
and
social
schemes
designed
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees
the
promoters
of
these
schemes
use
as
an
argument
and
as
an
appeal
that
better
relations
will
be
thus
established
that
strikes
will
be
prevented
and
that
in
the
end
the
money
returned
to
the
stockholders
will
be
increased
however
praiseworthy
this
appeal
may
be
in
motive
it
involves
a
distinct
confusion
of
issues
and
in
theory
deserves
the
failure
it
so
often
meets
with
in
practice
in
the
clash
which
follows
a
strike
the
employees
are
accused
of
an
ingratitude
when
there
was
no
legitimate
reason
to
expect
gratitude
and
useless
bitterness
which
has
really
a
factitious
basis
may
be
developed
on
both
sides
indeed
unless
the
relation
becomes
a
democratic
one
the
chances
of
misunderstanding
are
increased
when
to
the
relation
of
employer
and
employees
is
added
the
relation
of
benefactor
to
beneficiaries
in
so
far
as
there
is
still
another
opportunity
for
acting
upon
the
individual
code
of
ethics
there
is
no
doubt
that
these
efforts
are
to
be
commended
not
only
from
the
standpoint
of
their
social
value
but
because
they
have
a
marked
industrial
significance
failing
as
they
do
however
to
touch
the
question
of
wages
and
hours
which
are
almost
invariably
the
points
of
effort
the
employers
confuse
the
mind
of
the
public
when
they
urge
the
amelioration
of
conditions
and
the
kindly
relation
existing
between
them
and
their
men
as
a
reason
for
the
discontinuance
of
strikes
and
other
tactics
the
men
have
individually
accepted
the
kindness
of
the
employers
as
it
was
individually
offered
but
quite
as
the
latter
urges
his
inability
to
increase
wages
unless
he
has
the
coöperation
of
his
competitors
so
the
men
state
that
they
are
bound
to
the
struggle
for
an
increase
in
wages
because
it
can
only
be
undertaken
by
combinations
of
labor
even
the
much
more
democratic
effort
to
divide
a
proportion
of
the
profits
at
the
end
of
the
year
among
the
employees
upon
the
basis
of
their
wages
and
efficiency
is
also
exposed
to
a
weakness
from
the
fact
that
the
employing
side
has
the
power
of
determining
to
whom
the
benefit
shall
accrue
both
individual
acts
of
on
the
part
of
the
wage
earner
and
individual
acts
of
benevolence
on
the
part
of
the
employer
are
most
useful
as
they
establish
standards
to
which
the
average
worker
and
employer
may
in
time
be
legally
compelled
to
conform
progress
must
always
come
through
the
individual
who
varies
from
the
type
and
has
sufficient
energy
to
express
this
variation
he
first
holds
a
higher
conception
than
that
held
by
the
mass
of
his
fellows
of
what
is
righteous
under
given
conditions
and
expresses
this
conviction
in
conduct
in
many
instances
formulating
a
certain
scruple
which
the
others
share
but
have
not
yet
defined
even
to
themselves
progress
however
is
not
secure
until
the
mass
has
conformed
to
this
new
righteousness
this
is
equally
true
in
regard
to
any
advance
made
in
the
standard
of
living
on
the
part
of
the
or
in
the
improved
conditions
of
industry
on
the
part
of
reforming
employers
the
mistake
lies
not
in
overpraising
the
advance
thus
inaugurated
by
individual
initiative
but
in
regarding
the
achievement
as
complete
in
a
social
sense
when
it
is
still
in
the
realm
of
individual
action
no
sane
manufacturer
regards
his
factory
as
the
centre
of
the
industrial
system
he
knows
very
well
that
the
cost
of
material
wages
and
selling
prices
are
determined
by
industrial
conditions
completely
beyond
his
control
yet
the
same
man
may
quite
calmly
regard
himself
and
his
own
private
principles
as
merely
and
expect
results
from
casual
philanthropy
which
can
only
be
accomplished
through
those
common
rules
of
life
and
labor
established
by
the
community
for
the
common
good
outside
of
and
surrounding
these
smaller
and
most
significant
efforts
are
the
larger
and
irresistible
movements
operating
toward
combination
this
movement
must
tend
to
decide
upon
social
matters
from
the
social
standpoint
until
then
it
is
difficult
to
keep
our
minds
free
from
a
confusion
of
issues
such
a
confusion
occurs
when
the
gift
of
a
large
sum
to
the
community
for
a
public
and
philanthropic
purpose
throws
a
certain
glamour
over
all
the
earlier
acts
of
a
man
and
makes
it
difficult
for
the
community
to
see
possible
wrongs
committed
against
it
in
the
accumulation
of
wealth
so
beneficently
used
it
is
possible
also
that
the
resolve
to
be
thus
generous
unconsciously
influences
the
man
himself
in
his
methods
of
accumulation
he
keeps
to
a
certain
individual
rectitude
meaning
to
make
an
individual
restitution
by
the
old
paths
of
generosity
and
kindness
whereas
if
he
had
in
view
social
restitution
on
the
newer
lines
of
justice
and
opportunity
he
would
throughout
his
course
doubtless
be
watchful
of
his
industrial
relationships
and
his
social
virtues
the
danger
of
professionally
attaining
to
the
power
of
the
righteous
man
of
yielding
to
the
ambition
for
doing
good
on
a
large
scale
compared
to
which
the
ambition
for
politics
learning
or
wealth
are
vulgar
and
commonplace
ramifies
through
our
modern
life
and
those
most
easily
beset
by
this
temptation
are
precisely
the
men
best
situated
to
experiment
on
the
larger
social
lines
because
they
so
easily
dramatize
their
acts
and
lead
public
opinion
very
often
too
they
have
in
their
hands
the
preservation
and
advancement
of
large
vested
interests
and
often
see
clearly
and
truly
that
they
are
better
able
to
administer
the
affairs
of
the
community
than
the
community
itself
sometimes
they
see
that
if
they
do
not
administer
them
sharply
and
quickly
as
only
an
individual
can
certain
interests
of
theirs
dependent
upon
the
community
will
go
to
ruin
the
model
employer
first
considered
provided
a
large
sum
in
his
will
with
which
to
build
and
equip
a
polytechnic
school
which
will
doubtless
be
of
great
public
value
this
again
shows
the
advantage
of
individual
management
in
the
spending
as
well
as
in
the
accumulating
of
wealth
but
this
school
will
attain
its
highest
good
in
so
far
as
it
incites
the
ambition
to
provide
other
schools
from
public
funds
the
town
of
zurich
possesses
a
magnificent
polytechnic
institute
secured
by
the
vote
of
the
entire
people
and
supported
from
public
taxes
every
man
who
voted
for
it
is
interested
that
his
child
should
enjoy
its
benefits
and
of
course
the
voluntary
attendance
must
be
larger
than
in
a
school
accepted
as
a
gift
to
the
community
in
the
educational
efforts
of
model
employers
as
in
other
attempts
toward
social
amelioration
one
man
with
the
best
of
intentions
is
trying
to
do
what
the
entire
body
of
employees
should
have
undertaken
to
do
for
themselves
the
result
of
his
efforts
will
only
attain
its
highest
value
as
it
serves
as
an
incentive
to
procure
other
results
by
the
community
as
well
as
for
the
community
there
are
doubtless
many
things
which
the
public
would
never
demand
unless
they
were
first
supplied
by
individual
initiative
both
because
the
public
lacks
the
imagination
and
also
the
power
of
formulating
their
wants
thus
philanthropic
effort
supplies
kindergartens
until
they
become
so
established
in
the
popular
affections
that
they
are
incorporated
in
the
public
school
system
churches
and
missions
establish
reading
rooms
until
at
last
the
public
library
system
dots
the
city
with
branch
reading
rooms
and
libraries
for
this
willingness
to
take
risks
for
the
sake
of
an
ideal
for
those
experiments
which
must
be
undertaken
with
vigor
and
boldness
in
order
to
secure
didactic
value
in
failure
as
well
as
in
success
society
must
depend
upon
the
individual
possessed
with
money
and
also
distinguished
by
earnest
and
unselfish
purpose
such
experiments
enable
the
nation
to
use
the
referendum
method
in
its
public
affairs
each
social
experiment
is
thus
tested
by
a
few
people
given
wide
publicity
that
it
may
be
observed
and
discussed
by
the
bulk
of
the
citizens
before
the
public
prudently
makes
up
its
mind
whether
or
not
it
is
wise
to
incorporate
it
into
the
functions
of
government
if
the
decision
is
in
its
favor
and
it
is
so
incorporated
it
can
then
be
carried
on
with
confidence
and
enthusiasm
but
experience
has
shown
that
we
can
only
depend
upon
successful
men
for
a
certain
type
of
experiment
in
the
line
of
industrial
amelioration
and
social
advancement
the
list
of
those
who
found
churches
educational
institutions
libraries
and
art
galleries
is
very
long
as
is
again
the
list
of
those
contributing
to
model
dwellings
recreation
halls
and
athletic
fields
at
the
present
moment
factory
employers
are
doing
much
to
promote
industrial
betterment
in
the
way
of
sanitary
surroundings
opportunities
for
bathing
lunch
rooms
provided
with
cheap
and
wholesome
food
club
rooms
and
guild
halls
but
there
is
a
line
of
social
experiment
involving
social
righteousness
in
its
most
advanced
form
in
which
the
number
of
employers
and
the
favored
class
are
so
few
that
it
is
plain
society
can
not
count
upon
them
for
continuous
and
valuable
help
this
lack
is
in
the
line
of
factory
legislation
and
that
sort
of
social
advance
implied
in
shorter
hours
and
the
regulation
of
wages
in
short
all
that
organization
and
activity
that
is
involved
in
such
a
maintenance
and
increase
of
wages
as
would
prevent
the
lowering
of
the
standard
of
life
a
large
body
of
people
feel
keenly
that
the
present
industrial
system
is
in
a
state
of
profound
disorder
and
that
there
is
no
guarantee
that
the
pursuit
of
individual
ethics
will
ever
right
it
they
claim
that
relief
can
only
come
through
deliberate
corporate
effort
inspired
by
social
ideas
and
guided
by
the
study
of
economic
laws
and
that
the
present
industrial
system
thwarts
our
ethical
demands
not
only
for
social
righteousness
but
for
social
order
because
they
believe
that
each
advance
in
ethics
must
be
made
fast
by
a
corresponding
advance
in
politics
and
legal
enactment
they
insist
upon
the
right
of
state
regulation
and
control
while
many
people
representing
all
classes
in
a
community
would
assent
to
this
as
to
a
general
proposition
and
would
even
admit
it
as
a
certain
moral
obligation
legislative
enactments
designed
to
control
industrial
conditions
have
largely
been
secured
through
the
efforts
of
a
few
citizens
mostly
those
who
constantly
see
the
harsh
conditions
of
labor
and
who
are
incited
to
activity
by
their
sympathies
as
well
as
their
convictions
this
may
be
illustrated
by
the
series
of
legal
enactments
regulating
the
occupations
in
which
children
may
be
allowed
to
work
also
the
laws
in
regard
to
the
hours
of
labor
permitted
in
those
occupations
and
the
minimum
age
below
which
children
may
not
be
employed
the
first
child
labor
laws
were
enacted
in
england
through
the
efforts
of
those
members
of
parliament
whose
hearts
were
wrung
by
the
condition
of
the
little
parish
apprentices
bound
out
to
the
early
textile
manufacturers
of
the
north
and
through
the
long
years
required
to
build
up
the
code
of
child
labor
legislation
which
england
now
possesses
knowledge
of
the
conditions
has
always
preceded
effective
legislation
the
efforts
of
that
small
number
in
every
community
who
believe
in
legislative
control
have
always
been
reënforced
by
the
efforts
of
rather
than
by
the
efforts
of
employers
partly
because
the
employment
of
workingmen
in
the
factories
brings
them
in
contact
with
the
children
who
tend
to
lower
wages
and
demoralize
their
trades
and
partly
because
workingmen
have
no
money
nor
time
to
spend
in
alleviating
philanthropy
and
must
perforce
seize
upon
agitation
and
legal
enactment
as
the
only
channel
of
redress
which
is
open
to
them
we
may
illustrate
by
imagining
a
row
of
people
seated
in
a
moving
into
which
darts
a
boy
of
eight
calling
out
the
details
of
the
last
murder
in
the
hope
of
selling
an
evening
newspaper
a
comfortable
looking
man
buys
a
paper
from
him
with
no
sense
of
moral
shock
he
may
even
be
a
trifle
complacent
that
he
has
helped
along
the
little
fellow
who
is
making
his
way
in
the
world
the
philanthropic
lady
sitting
next
to
him
may
perhaps
reflect
that
it
is
a
pity
that
such
a
bright
boy
is
not
in
school
she
may
make
up
her
mind
in
a
moment
of
compunction
to
redouble
her
efforts
for
various
newsboys
schools
and
homes
that
this
poor
child
may
have
better
teaching
and
perhaps
a
chance
at
manual
training
she
probably
is
convinced
that
he
alone
by
his
unaided
efforts
is
supporting
a
widowed
mother
and
her
heart
is
moved
to
do
all
she
can
for
him
next
to
her
sits
a
workingman
trained
in
methods
he
knows
that
the
boy
natural
development
is
arrested
and
that
the
abnormal
activity
of
his
body
and
mind
uses
up
the
force
which
should
go
into
growth
moreover
that
this
premature
use
of
his
powers
has
but
a
momentary
and
specious
value
he
is
forced
to
these
conclusions
because
he
has
seen
many
a
man
entering
the
factory
at
eighteen
and
twenty
so
worn
out
by
premature
work
that
he
was
laid
on
the
shelf
within
ten
or
fifteen
years
he
knows
very
well
that
he
can
do
nothing
in
the
way
of
ameliorating
the
lot
of
this
particular
boy
that
his
only
possible
chance
is
to
agitate
for
proper
laws
to
regulate
and
if
possible
prohibit
by
children
in
order
that
the
child
of
the
poorest
may
have
his
school
time
secured
to
him
and
may
have
at
least
his
short
chance
for
growth
these
three
people
sitting
in
the
street
car
are
all
honest
and
upright
and
recognize
a
certain
duty
toward
the
forlorn
children
of
the
community
the
man
is
encouraging
one
boy
own
efforts
the
philanthropic
lady
is
helping
on
a
few
boys
the
workingman
alone
is
obliged
to
include
all
the
boys
of
his
class
workingmen
because
of
their
feebleness
in
all
but
numbers
have
been
forced
to
appeal
to
the
state
in
order
to
secure
protection
for
themselves
and
for
their
children
they
can
not
all
rise
out
of
their
class
as
the
occasionally
successful
man
has
done
some
of
them
must
be
left
to
do
the
work
in
the
factories
and
mines
and
they
have
no
money
to
spend
in
philanthropy
both
public
agitation
and
a
social
appeal
to
the
conscience
of
the
community
is
necessary
in
order
to
secure
help
from
the
state
and
curiously
enough
laws
once
enacted
and
enforced
are
a
matter
of
great
pride
and
even
come
to
be
regarded
as
a
register
of
the
community
humanity
and
enlightenment
if
the
method
of
public
agitation
could
find
quiet
and
orderly
expression
in
legislative
enactment
and
if
labor
measures
could
be
submitted
to
the
examination
and
judgment
of
the
whole
without
a
sense
of
division
or
of
warfare
we
should
have
the
ideal
development
of
the
democratic
state
but
we
judge
labor
organizations
as
we
do
other
living
institutions
not
by
their
declaration
of
principles
which
we
seldom
read
but
by
their
blundering
efforts
to
apply
their
principles
to
actual
conditions
and
by
the
failure
of
their
representatives
when
the
individual
finds
himself
too
weak
to
become
the
organ
of
corporate
action
the
very
blunders
and
lack
of
organization
too
often
characterizing
a
union
in
marked
contrast
to
the
orderly
management
of
a
factory
often
confuse
us
as
to
the
real
issues
involved
and
we
find
it
hard
to
trust
uncouth
and
unruly
manifestations
of
social
effort
the
situation
is
made
even
more
complicated
by
the
fact
that
those
who
are
formulating
a
code
of
associated
action
so
often
break
through
the
established
code
of
law
and
order
as
society
has
a
right
to
demand
of
the
reforming
individual
that
he
be
sternly
held
to
his
personal
and
domestic
claims
so
it
has
a
right
to
insist
that
labor
organizations
shall
keep
to
the
hardly
won
standards
of
public
law
and
order
and
the
community
performs
but
its
plain
duty
when
it
registers
its
protest
every
time
law
and
order
are
subverted
even
in
the
interest
of
the
social
effort
yet
in
moments
of
industrial
stress
and
strain
the
community
is
confronted
by
a
moral
perplexity
which
may
arise
from
the
mere
fact
that
the
good
of
yesterday
is
opposed
to
the
good
of
today
and
that
which
may
appear
as
a
choice
between
virtue
and
vice
is
really
but
a
choice
between
virtue
and
virtue
in
the
disorder
and
confusion
sometimes
incident
to
growth
and
progress
the
community
may
be
unable
to
see
anything
but
the
unlovely
struggle
itself
the
writer
recalls
a
conversation
between
two
workingmen
who
were
leaving
a
lecture
on
organic
evolution
the
first
was
much
puzzled
and
anxiously
inquired
of
the
second
if
evolution
could
mean
that
one
animal
turned
into
another
the
challenged
workman
stopped
in
the
rear
of
the
hall
put
his
foot
upon
a
chair
and
expounded
what
he
thought
evolution
did
mean
and
this
so
nearly
as
the
conversation
can
be
recalled
is
what
he
said
you
see
a
lot
of
fishes
are
living
in
a
stream
which
overflows
in
the
spring
and
strands
some
of
them
upon
the
bank
the
weak
ones
die
up
there
but
others
make
a
big
effort
to
get
back
into
the
water
they
dig
their
fins
into
the
sand
breathe
as
much
air
as
they
can
with
their
gills
and
have
a
terrible
time
but
after
a
while
their
fins
turn
into
legs
and
their
gills
into
lungs
and
they
have
become
frogs
of
course
they
are
further
along
than
the
sleek
comfortable
fishes
who
sail
up
and
down
the
stream
waving
their
tails
and
despising
the
poor
damaged
things
thrashing
around
on
the
bank
he
the
lecturer
did
not
say
anything
about
men
but
it
is
easy
enough
to
think
of
us
poor
devils
on
the
dry
bank
struggling
without
enough
to
live
on
while
the
comfortable
fellows
sail
along
in
the
water
with
all
they
want
and
despise
us
because
we
thrash
about
his
listener
did
not
reply
and
was
evidently
dissatisfied
both
with
the
explanation
and
the
application
doubtless
the
illustration
was
bungling
in
more
than
its
setting
forth
but
the
story
is
suggestive
at
times
of
social
disturbance
the
citizen
is
naturally
so
anxious
for
peace
and
order
his
sympathies
are
so
justly
and
inevitably
on
the
side
making
for
the
restoration
of
law
that
it
is
difficult
for
him
to
see
the
situation
fairly
he
becomes
insensible
to
the
unselfish
impulse
which
may
prompt
a
sympathetic
strike
in
behalf
of
the
workers
in
a
shop
because
he
allows
his
mind
to
dwell
exclusively
on
the
disorder
which
has
become
associated
with
the
strike
he
is
completely
by
the
ugly
phases
of
a
great
moral
movement
it
is
always
a
temptation
to
assume
that
the
side
which
has
respectability
authority
and
superior
intelligence
has
therefore
righteousness
as
well
especially
when
the
same
side
presents
concrete
results
of
individual
effort
as
over
against
the
less
tangible
results
of
associated
effort
it
is
as
yet
most
difficult
for
us
to
free
ourselves
from
the
individualistic
point
of
view
sufficiently
to
group
events
in
their
social
relations
and
to
judge
fairly
those
who
are
endeavoring
to
produce
a
social
result
through
all
the
difficulties
of
associated
action
the
philanthropist
still
finds
his
path
much
easier
than
do
those
who
are
attempting
a
social
morality
in
the
first
place
the
public
anxious
to
praise
what
it
recognizes
as
an
undoubted
moral
effort
often
attended
with
real
personal
sacrifice
joyfully
seizes
upon
this
manifestation
and
overpraises
it
recognizing
the
philanthropist
as
an
old
friend
in
the
paths
of
righteousness
whereas
the
others
are
strangers
and
possibly
to
be
distrusted
as
aliens
it
is
easy
to
confuse
the
response
to
an
abnormal
number
of
individual
claims
with
the
response
to
the
social
claim
an
exaggerated
personal
morality
is
often
mistaken
for
a
social
morality
and
until
it
attempts
to
minister
to
a
social
situation
its
total
inadequacy
is
not
discovered
to
attempt
to
attain
a
social
morality
without
a
basis
of
democratic
experience
results
in
the
loss
of
the
only
possible
corrective
and
guide
and
ends
in
an
exaggerated
individual
morality
but
not
in
social
morality
at
all
we
see
this
from
time
to
time
in
the
and
overworked
philanthropist
who
has
taxed
his
individual
will
beyond
the
normal
limits
and
has
lost
his
clew
to
the
situation
among
a
bewildering
number
of
cases
a
man
who
takes
the
betterment
of
humanity
for
his
aim
and
end
must
also
take
the
daily
experiences
of
humanity
for
the
constant
correction
of
his
process
he
must
not
only
test
and
guide
his
achievement
by
human
experience
but
he
must
succeed
or
fail
in
proportion
as
he
has
incorporated
that
experience
with
his
own
otherwise
his
own
achievements
become
his
and
he
comes
to
believe
in
his
own
goodness
as
something
outside
of
himself
he
makes
an
exception
of
himself
and
thinks
that
he
is
different
from
the
rank
and
file
of
his
fellows
he
forgets
that
it
is
necessary
to
know
of
the
lives
of
our
contemporaries
not
only
in
order
to
believe
in
their
integrity
which
is
after
all
but
the
first
beginnings
of
social
morality
but
in
order
to
attain
to
any
mental
or
moral
integrity
for
ourselves
or
any
such
hope
for
society
chapter

educational
methods
as
democracy
modifies
our
conception
of
life
it
constantly
raises
the
value
and
function
of
each
member
of
the
community
however
humble
he
may
be
we
have
come
to
believe
that
the
most
brutish
man
has
a
value
in
our
common
life
a
function
to
perform
which
can
be
fulfilled
by
no
one
else
we
are
gradually
requiring
of
the
educator
that
he
shall
free
the
powers
of
each
man
and
connect
him
with
the
rest
of
life
we
ask
this
not
merely
because
it
is
the
man
right
to
be
thus
connected
but
because
we
have
become
convinced
that
the
social
order
can
not
afford
to
get
along
without
his
special
contribution
just
as
we
have
come
to
resent
all
hindrances
which
keep
us
from
untrammelled
comradeship
with
our
fellows
and
as
we
throw
down
unnatural
divisions
not
in
the
spirit
of
the
reformers
but
in
the
spirit
of
those
to
whom
social
equality
has
become
a
necessity
for
further
social
development
so
we
are
impatient
to
use
the
dynamic
power
residing
in
the
mass
of
men
and
demand
that
the
educator
free
that
power
we
believe
that
man
moral
idealism
is
the
constructive
force
of
progress
as
it
has
always
been
but
because
every
human
being
is
a
creative
agent
and
a
possible
generator
of
fine
enthusiasm
we
are
sceptical
of
the
moral
idealism
of
the
few
and
demand
the
education
of
the
many
that
there
may
be
greater
freedom
strength
and
subtilty
of
intercourse
and
hence
an
increase
of
dynamic
power
we
are
not
content
to
include
all
men
in
our
hopes
but
have
become
conscious
that
all
men
are
hoping
and
are
part
of
the
same
movement
of
which
we
are
a
part
many
people
impelled
by
these
ideas
have
become
impatient
with
the
slow
recognition
on
the
part
of
the
educators
of
their
manifest
obligation
to
prepare
and
nourish
the
child
and
the
citizen
for
social
relations
the
educators
should
certainly
conserve
the
learning
and
training
necessary
for
the
successful
individual
and
family
life
but
should
add
to
that
a
preparation
for
the
enlarged
social
efforts
which
our
increasing
democracy
requires
the
democratic
ideal
demands
of
the
school
that
it
shall
give
the
child
own
experience
a
social
value
that
it
shall
teach
him
to
direct
his
own
activities
and
adjust
them
to
those
of
other
people
we
are
not
willing
that
thousands
of
industrial
workers
shall
put
all
of
their
activity
and
toil
into
services
from
which
the
community
as
a
whole
reaps
the
benefit
while
their
mental
conceptions
and
code
of
morals
are
narrow
and
untouched
by
any
uplift
which
the
consciousness
of
social
value
might
give
them
we
are
impatient
with
the
schools
which
lay
all
stress
on
reading
and
writing
suspecting
them
to
rest
upon
the
assumption
that
the
ordinary
experience
of
life
is
worth
little
and
that
all
knowledge
and
interest
must
be
brought
to
the
children
through
the
medium
of
books
such
an
assumption
fails
to
give
the
child
any
clew
to
the
life
about
him
or
any
power
to
usefully
or
intelligently
connect
himself
with
it
this
may
be
illustrated
by
observations
made
in
a
large
italian
colony
situated
in
chicago
the
children
from
which
are
for
the
most
part
sent
to
the
public
schools
the
members
of
the
italian
colony
are
largely
from
south
italy
calabrian
and
sicilian
peasants
or
neapolitans
from
the
workingmen
quarters
of
that
city
they
have
come
to
america
with
the
distinct
aim
of
earning
money
and
finding
more
room
for
the
energies
of
themselves
and
their
children
in
almost
all
cases
they
mean
to
go
back
again
simply
because
their
imaginations
can
not
picture
a
continuous
life
away
from
the
old
surroundings
their
experiences
in
italy
have
been
those
of
simple
outdoor
activity
and
their
ideas
have
come
directly
to
them
from
their
struggle
with
nature
such
a
struggle
as
takes
place
when
each
man
gets
his
living
largely
through
his
own
cultivation
of
the
soil
or
with
tools
simply
fashioned
by
his
own
hands
the
women
as
in
all
primitive
life
have
had
more
diversified
activities
than
the
men
they
have
cooked
spun
and
knitted
in
addition
to
their
almost
equal
work
in
the
fields
very
few
of
the
peasant
men
or
women
can
either
read
or
write
they
are
devoted
to
their
children
strong
in
their
family
feeling
even
to
remote
relationships
and
clannish
in
their
community
life
the
entire
family
has
been
upheaved
and
is
striving
to
adjust
itself
to
its
new
surroundings
the
men
for
the
most
part
work
on
railroad
extensions
through
the
summer
under
the
direction
of
a
who
finds
the
work
for
them
regulates
the
amount
of
their
wages
and
supplies
them
with
food
the
first
effect
of
immigration
upon
the
women
is
that
of
idleness
they
no
longer
work
in
the
fields
nor
milk
the
goats
nor
pick
up
faggots
the
mother
of
the
family
buys
all
the
clothing
not
only
already
spun
and
woven
but
made
up
into
garments
of
a
cut
and
fashion
beyond
her
powers
it
is
indeed
the
most
economical
thing
for
her
to
do
her
and
cooking
are
of
the
simplest
the
bread
is
usually
baked
outside
of
the
house
and
the
macaroni
bought
prepared
for
boiling
all
of
those
outdoor
and
domestic
activities
which
she
would
naturally
have
handed
on
to
her
daughters
have
slipped
away
from
her
the
domestic
arts
are
gone
with
their
absorbing
interests
for
the
children
their
educational
value
and
incentive
to
activity
a
household
in
a
tenement
receives
almost
no
raw
material
for
the
hundreds
of
children
who
have
never
seen
wheat
grow
there
are
dozens
who
have
never
seen
bread
baked
the
occasional
washings
and
scrubbings
are
associated
only
with
discomfort
the
child
of
such
a
family
receives
constant
stimulus
of
most
exciting
sort
from
his
city
street
life
but
he
has
little
or
no
opportunity
to
use
his
energies
in
domestic
manufacture
or
indeed
constructively
in
any
direction
no
activity
is
supplied
to
take
the
place
of
that
which
in
italy
he
would
naturally
have
found
in
his
own
surroundings
and
no
new
union
with
wholesome
life
is
made
for
him
italian
parents
count
upon
the
fact
that
their
children
learn
the
english
language
and
american
customs
before
they
do
themselves
and
the
children
act
not
only
as
interpreters
of
the
language
but
as
buffers
between
them
and
chicago
resulting
in
a
certain
almost
pathetic
dependence
of
the
family
upon
the
child
when
a
child
of
the
family
therefore
first
goes
to
school
the
event
is
fraught
with
much
significance
to
all
the
others
the
family
has
no
social
life
in
any
structural
form
and
can
supply
none
to
the
child
he
ought
to
get
it
in
the
school
and
give
it
to
his
family
the
school
thus
becoming
the
connector
with
the
organized
society
about
them
it
is
the
children
aged
six
eight
and
ten
who
go
to
school
entering
of
course
the
primary
grades
if
a
boy
is
twelve
or
thirteen
on
his
arrival
in
america
his
parents
see
in
him
a
factor
and
the
girl
of
the
same
age
is
already
looking
toward
her
marriage
let
us
take
one
of
these
boys
who
has
learned
in
his
six
or
eight
years
to
speak
his
native
language
and
to
feel
himself
strongly
identified
with
the
fortunes
of
his
family
whatever
interest
has
come
to
the
minds
of
his
ancestors
has
come
through
the
use
of
their
hands
in
the
open
air
and
open
air
and
activity
of
body
have
been
the
inevitable
accompaniments
of
all
their
experiences
yet
the
first
thing
that
the
boy
must
do
when
he
reaches
school
is
to
sit
still
at
least
part
of
the
time
and
he
must
learn
to
listen
to
what
is
said
to
him
with
all
the
perplexity
of
listening
to
a
foreign
tongue
he
does
not
find
this
very
stimulating
and
is
slow
to
respond
to
the
more
subtle
incentives
of
the
schoolroom
the
peasant
child
is
perfectly
indifferent
to
showing
off
and
making
a
good
recitation
he
leaves
all
that
to
his
schoolfellows
who
are
more
sophisticated
and
equipped
with
better
english
his
parents
are
not
deeply
interested
in
keeping
him
in
school
and
will
not
hold
him
there
against
his
inclination
their
experience
does
not
point
to
the
good
american
tradition
that
it
is
the
educated
man
who
finally
succeeds
the
richest
man
in
the
italian
colony
can
neither
read
nor
write
even
italian
his
cunning
and
acquisitiveness
combined
with
the
credulity
and
ignorance
of
his
countrymen
have
slowly
brought
about
his
large
fortune
the
child
himself
may
feel
the
stirring
of
a
vague
ambition
to
go
on
until
he
is
as
the
other
children
are
but
he
is
not
popular
with
his
schoolfellows
and
he
sadly
feels
the
lack
of
dramatic
interest
even
the
pictures
and
objects
presented
to
him
as
well
as
the
language
are
strange
if
we
admit
that
in
education
it
is
necessary
to
begin
with
the
experiences
which
the
child
already
has
and
to
use
his
spontaneous
and
social
activity
then
the
city
streets
begin
this
education
for
him
in
a
more
natural
way
than
does
the
school
the
south
italian
peasant
comes
from
a
life
of
picking
olives
and
oranges
and
he
easily
sends
his
children
out
to
pick
up
coal
from
railroad
tracks
or
wood
from
buildings
which
have
been
burned
down
unfortunately
this
process
leads
by
easy
transition
to
petty
thieving
it
is
easy
to
go
from
the
coal
on
the
railroad
track
to
the
coal
and
wood
which
stand
before
a
shop
from
the
potatoes
which
have
rolled
from
a
rumbling
wagon
to
the
vegetables
displayed
by
the
grocer
this
is
apt
to
be
the
record
of
the
boy
who
responds
constantly
to
the
stimulus
and
temptations
of
the
street
although
in
the
beginning
his
search
for
bits
of
food
and
fuel
was
prompted
by
the
best
of
motives
the
school
has
to
compete
with
a
great
deal
from
the
outside
in
addition
to
the
distractions
of
the
neighborhood
nothing
is
more
fascinating
than
that
mysterious
down
town
whither
the
boy
longs
to
go
to
sell
papers
and
black
boots
to
attend
theatres
and
if
possible
to
stay
all
night
on
the
pretence
of
waiting
for
the
early
edition
of
the
great
dailies
if
a
boy
is
once
thoroughly
caught
in
these
excitements
nothing
can
save
him
from
and
consequent
debility
and
worthlessness
he
arrives
at
maturity
with
no
habits
of
regular
work
and
with
a
distaste
for
its
dulness
on
the
other
hand
there
are
hundreds
of
boys
of
various
nationalities
who
conscientiously
remain
in
school
and
fulfil
all
the
requirements
of
the
early
grades
and
at
the
age
of
fourteen
are
found
in
factories
painstakingly
performing
their
work
year
after
year
these
later
are
the
men
who
form
the
mass
of
the
population
in
every
industrial
neighborhood
of
every
large
city
but
they
carry
on
the
industrial
processes
year
after
year
without
in
the
least
knowing
what
it
is
all
about
the
one
fixed
habit
which
the
boy
carries
away
with
him
from
the
school
to
the
factory
is
the
feeling
that
his
work
is
merely
provisional
in
school
the
next
grade
was
continually
held
before
him
as
an
object
of
attainment
and
it
resulted
in
the
conviction
that
the
sole
object
of
present
effort
is
to
get
ready
for
something
else
this
tentative
attitude
takes
the
last
bit
of
social
stimulus
out
of
his
factory
work
he
pursues
it
merely
as
a
necessity
and
his
very
mental
attitude
destroys
his
chance
for
a
realization
of
its
social
value
as
the
boy
in
school
contracted
the
habit
of
doing
his
work
in
certain
hours
and
taking
his
pleasure
in
certain
other
hours
so
in
the
factory
he
earns
his
money
by
ten
hours
of
dull
work
and
spends
it
in
three
hours
of
lurid
and
unprofitable
pleasure
in
the
evening
both
in
the
school
and
in
the
factory
in
proportion
as
his
work
grows
dull
and
monotonous
his
recreation
must
become
more
exciting
and
stimulating
the
hopelessness
of
adding
evening
classes
and
social
entertainments
as
a
mere
frill
to
a
day
filled
with
monotonous
and
deadening
drudgery
constantly
becomes
more
apparent
to
those
who
are
endeavoring
to
bring
a
fuller
life
to
the
industrial
members
of
the
community
and
who
are
looking
forward
to
a
time
when
work
shall
cease
to
be
senseless
drudgery
with
no
on
the
part
of
the
worker
it
sometimes
seems
that
the
public
schools
should
contribute
much
more
than
they
do
to
the
consummation
of
this
time
if
the
army
of
school
children
who
enter
the
factories
every
year
possessed
thoroughly
vitalized
faculties
they
might
do
much
to
lighten
this
incubus
of
dull
factory
work
which
presses
so
heavily
upon
so
large
a
number
of
our
has
our
commercialism
been
so
strong
that
our
schools
have
become
insensibly
commercialized
whereas
we
supposed
that
our
industrial
life
was
receiving
the
broadening
and
illuminating
effects
of
the
schools
the
training
of
these
children
so
far
as
it
has
been
vocational
at
all
has
been
in
the
direction
of
clerical
work
it
is
possible
that
the
business
men
whom
we
in
america
so
tremendously
admire
have
really
been
dictating
the
curriculum
of
our
public
schools
in
spite
of
the
conventions
of
educators
and
the
suggestions
of
university
professors
the
business
man
of
course
has
not
said
i
will
have
the
public
schools
train
office
boys
and
clerks
so
that
i
may
have
them
easily
and
cheaply
but
he
has
sometimes
said
teach
the
children
to
write
legibly
and
to
figure
accurately
and
quickly
to
acquire
habits
of
punctuality
and
order
to
be
prompt
to
obey
and
you
will
fit
them
to
make
their
way
in
the
world
as
i
have
made
mine
has
the
workingman
been
silent
as
to
what
he
desires
for
his
children
and
allowed
the
business
man
to
decide
for
him
there
as
he
has
allowed
the
politician
to
manage
his
municipal
affairs
or
has
the
workingman
so
far
shared
our
universal
optimism
that
he
has
really
believed
that
his
children
would
never
need
to
go
into
industrial
life
at
all
but
that
all
of
his
sons
would
become
bankers
and
merchants
certain
it
is
that
no
sufficient
study
has
been
made
of
the
child
who
enters
into
industrial
life
early
and
stays
there
permanently
to
give
him
some
offset
to
its
monotony
and
dulness
some
historic
significance
of
the
part
he
is
taking
in
the
life
of
the
community
it
is
at
last
on
behalf
of
the
average
workingmen
that
our
increasing
democracy
impels
us
to
make
a
new
demand
upon
the
educator
as
the
political
expression
of
democracy
has
claimed
for
the
workingman
the
free
right
of
citizenship
so
a
code
of
social
ethics
is
now
insisting
that
he
shall
be
a
conscious
member
of
society
having
some
notion
of
his
social
and
industrial
value
the
early
ideal
of
a
city
that
it
was
a
in
which
to
exchange
produce
and
a
mere
for
merchants
apparently
still
survives
in
our
minds
and
is
constantly
reflected
in
our
schools
we
have
either
failed
to
realize
that
cities
have
become
great
centres
of
production
and
manufacture
in
which
a
huge
population
is
engaged
or
we
have
lacked
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
adjust
ourselves
to
the
change
we
admire
much
more
the
men
who
accumulate
riches
and
who
gather
to
themselves
the
results
of
industry
than
the
men
who
actually
carry
forward
industrial
processes
and
as
has
been
pointed
out
our
schools
still
prepare
children
almost
exclusively
for
commercial
and
professional
life
quite
as
the
country
boy
dreams
of
leaving
the
farm
for
life
in
town
and
begins
early
to
imitate
the
travelling
salesman
in
dress
and
manner
so
the
school
boy
within
the
town
hopes
to
be
an
office
boy
and
later
a
clerk
or
salesman
and
looks
upon
work
in
the
factory
as
the
occupation
of
ignorant
and
unsuccessful
men
the
schools
do
so
little
really
to
interest
the
child
in
the
life
of
production
or
to
excite
his
ambition
in
the
line
of
industrial
occupation
that
the
ideal
of
life
almost
from
the
very
beginning
becomes
not
an
absorbing
interest
in
one
work
and
a
consciousness
of
its
value
and
social
relation
but
a
desire
for
money
with
which
unmeaning
purchases
may
be
made
and
an
unmeaning
social
standing
obtained
the
son
of
a
workingman
who
is
successful
in
commercial
life
impresses
his
family
and
neighbors
quite
as
does
the
prominent
city
man
when
he
comes
back
to
dazzle
his
native
town
the
children
of
the
working
people
learn
many
useful
things
in
the
public
schools
but
the
commercial
arithmetic
and
many
other
studies
are
founded
on
the
tacit
assumption
that
a
boy
rises
in
life
by
getting
away
from
manual
labor
that
every
promising
boy
goes
into
business
or
a
profession
the
children
destined
for
factory
life
are
furnished
with
what
would
be
most
useful
under
other
conditions
quite
as
the
prosperous
farmer
wife
buys
a
for
her
huge
spare
room
because
her
sister
who
has
married
a
city
man
is
obliged
to
have
a
in
the
cramped
limits
of
her
flat
partly
because
so
little
is
done
for
him
educationally
and
partly
because
he
must
live
narrowly
and
dress
meanly
the
life
of
the
average
laborer
tends
to
become
flat
and
monotonous
with
nothing
in
his
work
to
feed
his
mind
or
hold
his
interest
theoretically
we
would
all
admit
that
the
man
at
the
bottom
who
performs
the
meanest
and
humblest
work
so
long
as
the
work
is
necessary
performs
a
useful
function
but
we
do
not
live
up
to
our
theories
and
in
addition
to
his
hard
and
uninteresting
work
he
is
covered
with
a
sort
of
contempt
and
unless
he
falls
into
illness
or
trouble
he
receives
little
sympathy
or
attention
certainly
no
serious
effort
is
made
to
give
him
a
participation
in
the
social
and
industrial
life
with
which
he
comes
in
contact
nor
any
insight
and
inspiration
regarding
it
apparently
we
have
not
yet
recovered
manual
labor
from
the
deep
distrust
which
centuries
of
slavery
and
the
feudal
system
have
cast
upon
it
to
get
away
from
menial
work
to
do
obviously
little
with
one
hands
is
still
the
desirable
status
this
may
readily
be
seen
all
along
the
line
a
workingman
family
will
make
every
effort
and
sacrifice
that
the
brightest
daughter
be
sent
to
the
high
school
and
through
the
normal
school
quite
as
much
because
a
teacher
in
the
family
raises
the
general
social
standing
and
sense
of
family
consequence
as
that
the
returns
are
superior
to
factory
or
even
office
work
teacher
in
the
vocabulary
of
many
children
is
a
synonym
for
gentry
and
the
name
is
indiscriminately
applied
to
women
of
certain
dress
and
manner
the
same
desire
for
social
advancement
is
expressed
by
the
purchasing
of
a
piano
or
the
fact
that
the
son
is
an
office
boy
and
not
a
factory
hand
the
overcrowding
of
the
professions
by
poorly
equipped
men
arises
from
much
the
same
source
and
from
the
conviction
that
an
education
is
wasted
if
a
boy
goes
into
a
factory
or
shop
a
chicago
manufacturer
tells
a
story
of
twin
boys
whom
he
befriended
and
meant
to
give
a
start
in
life
he
sent
them
both
to
the
athenæum
for
several
winters
as
a
preparatory
business
training
and
then
took
them
into
his
office
where
they
speedily
became
known
as
the
bright
one
and
the
stupid
one
the
stupid
one
was
finally
dismissed
after
repeated
trials
when
to
the
surprise
of
the
entire
establishment
he
quickly
betook
himself
into
the
shops
where
he
became
a
and
valuable
workman
his
chagrined
benefactor
in
telling
the
story
admits
that
he
himself
had
fallen
a
victim
to
his
own
business
training
and
his
early
notion
of
rising
in
life
in
reality
he
had
merely
followed
the
lead
of
most
benevolent
people
who
help
poor
boys
they
test
the
success
of
their
efforts
by
the
number
whom
they
have
taken
out
of
factory
work
into
some
other
and
higher
occupation
quite
in
line
with
this
commercial
ideal
are
the
night
schools
and
institutions
of
learning
most
accessible
to
working
people
first
among
them
is
the
business
college
which
teaches
largely
the
mechanism
of
and
and
lays
all
stress
upon
commerce
and
methods
of
distribution
commodities
are
treated
as
exports
and
imports
or
solely
in
regard
to
their
commercial
value
and
not
of
course
in
relation
to
their
historic
development
or
the
manufacturing
processes
to
which
they
have
been
subjected
these
schools
do
not
in
the
least
minister
to
the
needs
of
the
actual
factory
employee
who
is
in
the
shop
and
not
in
the
office
we
assume
that
all
men
are
searching
for
puddings
and
power
to
use
carlyle
phrase
and
furnish
only
the
schools
which
help
them
to
those
ends
the
business
college
man
or
even
the
man
who
goes
through
an
academic
course
in
order
to
prepare
for
a
profession
comes
to
look
on
learning
too
much
as
an
investment
from
which
he
will
later
reap
the
benefits
in
earning
money
he
does
not
connect
learning
with
industrial
pursuits
nor
does
he
in
the
least
lighten
or
illuminate
those
pursuits
for
those
of
his
friends
who
have
not
risen
in
life
it
is
as
though
nets
were
laid
at
the
entrance
to
education
in
which
those
who
by
some
means
or
other
escape
from
the
masses
bowed
down
by
labor
are
inevitably
caught
and
held
from
substantial
service
to
their
fellows
the
academic
teaching
which
is
accessible
to
workingmen
through
university
extension
lectures
and
classes
at
settlements
is
usually
bookish
and
remote
and
concerning
subjects
completely
divorced
from
their
actual
experiences
the
men
come
to
think
of
learning
as
something
to
be
added
to
the
end
of
a
hard
day
work
and
to
be
gained
at
the
cost
of
toilsome
mental
exertion
there
are
of
course
exceptions
but
many
men
who
persist
in
attending
classes
and
lectures
year
after
year
find
themselves
possessed
of
a
mass
of
inert
knowledge
which
nothing
in
their
experience
fuses
into
availability
or
realization
among
the
many
disappointments
which
the
settlement
experiment
has
brought
to
its
promoters
perhaps
none
is
keener
than
the
fact
that
they
have
as
yet
failed
to
work
out
methods
of
education
specialized
and
adapted
to
the
needs
of
adult
working
people
in
to
those
employed
in
schools
and
colleges
or
those
used
in
teaching
children
there
are
many
excellent
reasons
and
explanations
for
this
failure
in
the
first
place
the
residents
themselves
are
for
the
most
part
imbued
with
academic
methods
and
ideals
which
it
is
most
difficult
to
modify
to
quote
from
a
late
settlement
report
the
most
vaunted
educational
work
in
settlements
amounts
often
to
the
stimulation
mentally
of
a
select
few
who
are
in
a
sense
of
the
academic
type
of
mind
and
who
easily
and
quickly
respond
to
the
academic
methods
employed
these
classes
may
be
valuable
but
they
leave
quite
untouched
the
great
mass
of
the
factory
population
the
ordinary
workingman
of
the
ordinary
workingman
street
whose
attitude
is
best
described
as
that
of
acquiescence
who
lives
through
the
aimless
passage
of
the
years
without
incentive
to
imagine
to
design
or
to
aspire
these
men
are
totally
untouched
by
all
the
educational
and
philanthropic
machinery
which
is
designed
for
the
young
and
the
helpless
who
live
on
the
same
streets
with
them
they
do
not
often
drink
to
excess
they
regularly
give
all
their
wages
to
their
wives
they
have
a
vague
pride
in
their
superior
children
but
they
grow
prematurely
old
and
stiff
in
all
their
muscles
and
become
more
and
more
taciturn
their
entire
energies
consumed
in
holding
a
job
various
attempts
have
been
made
to
break
through
the
inadequate
educational
facilities
supplied
by
commercialism
and
scholarship
both
of
which
have
followed
their
own
ideals
and
have
failed
to
look
at
the
situation
as
it
actually
presents
itself
the
most
noteworthy
attempt
has
been
the
movement
toward
industrial
education
the
agitation
for
which
has
been
ably
seconded
by
manufacturers
of
a
practical
type
who
have
from
time
to
time
founded
and
endowed
technical
schools
designed
for
workingmen
sons
the
early
schools
of
this
type
inevitably
reflected
the
ideal
of
the
man
they
succeeded
in
transferring
a
few
skilled
workers
into
the
upper
class
of
trained
engineers
and
a
few
less
skilled
workers
into
the
class
of
trained
mechanics
but
did
not
aim
to
educate
the
many
who
are
doomed
to
the
unskilled
work
which
the
permanent
specialization
of
the
division
of
labor
demands
the
peter
coopers
and
other
good
men
honestly
believed
that
if
intelligence
could
be
added
to
industry
each
workingman
who
faithfully
attended
these
schools
could
walk
into
increased
skill
and
wages
and
in
time
even
become
an
employer
himself
such
schools
are
useful
beyond
doubt
but
so
far
as
educating
workingmen
is
concerned
or
in
any
measure
satisfying
the
democratic
ideal
they
plainly
beg
the
question
almost
every
large
city
has
two
or
three
polytechnic
institutions
founded
by
rich
men
anxious
to
help
poor
boys
these
have
been
captured
by
conventional
educators
for
the
purpose
of
fitting
young
men
for
the
colleges
and
universities
they
have
compromised
by
merely
adding
to
the
usual
academic
course
manual
work
applied
mathematics
mechanical
drawing
and
engineering
two
schools
in
chicago
plainly
founded
for
the
sons
of
workingmen
afford
an
illustration
of
this
tendency
and
result
on
the
other
hand
so
far
as
schools
of
this
type
have
been
captured
by
commercialism
they
turn
out
trained
engineers
professional
chemists
and
electricians
they
are
polytechnics
of
a
high
order
but
do
not
even
pretend
to
admit
the
workingman
with
his
meagre
intellectual
equipment
they
graduate
machine
builders
but
not
educated
machine
tenders
even
the
textile
schools
are
largely
seized
by
young
men
who
expect
to
be
superintendents
of
factories
designers
or
manufacturers
themselves
and
the
textile
worker
who
actually
holds
the
thread
is
seldom
seen
in
them
indeed
in
one
of
the
largest
schools
women
are
not
allowed
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
spinning
and
weaving
have
traditionally
been
woman
work
and
that
thousands
of
women
are
at
present
employed
in
the
textile
mills
it
is
much
easier
to
go
over
the
old
paths
of
education
with
manual
training
thrown
in
as
it
were
it
is
much
simpler
to
appeal
to
the
old
ambitions
of
getting
on
in
life
or
of
preparing
for
a
profession
or
for
a
commercial
career
than
to
work
out
new
methods
on
democratic
lines
these
schools
gradually
drop
back
into
the
conventional
courses
modified
in
some
slight
degree
while
the
adaptation
to
needs
is
never
made
nor
indeed
vigorously
attempted
in
the
meantime
the
manufacturers
continually
protest
that
engineers
especially
trained
for
devising
machines
are
not
satisfactory
three
generations
of
workers
have
invented
but
we
are
told
that
invention
no
longer
goes
on
in
the
workshop
even
when
it
is
artificially
stimulated
by
the
offer
of
prizes
and
that
the
inventions
of
the
last
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
have
by
no
means
fulfilled
the
promise
of
the
earlier
every
foreman
in
a
large
factory
has
had
experience
with
two
classes
of
men
first
with
those
who
become
rigid
and
tolerate
no
change
in
their
work
partly
because
they
make
more
money
working
by
the
piece
when
they
stick
to
that
work
which
they
have
learned
to
do
rapidly
and
partly
because
the
entire
muscular
and
nervous
system
has
become
by
daily
use
adapted
to
particular
motions
and
resents
change
secondly
there
are
the
men
who
float
in
and
out
of
the
factory
in
a
constantly
changing
stream
they
quit
work
for
the
slightest
reason
or
none
at
all
and
never
become
skilled
at
anything
some
of
them
are
men
of
low
intelligence
but
many
of
them
are
merely
too
nervous
and
restless
too
impatient
too
easily
driven
to
drink
to
be
of
any
use
in
a
modern
factory
they
are
the
men
for
whom
the
demanded
adaptation
is
impossible
the
individual
from
whom
the
industrial
order
demands
ever
larger
drafts
of
time
and
energy
should
be
nourished
and
enriched
from
social
sources
in
proportion
as
he
is
drained
he
more
than
other
men
needs
the
conception
of
historic
continuity
in
order
to
reveal
to
him
the
purpose
and
utility
of
his
work
and
he
can
only
be
stimulated
and
dignified
as
he
obtains
a
conception
of
his
proper
relation
to
society
scholarship
is
evidently
unable
to
do
this
for
him
for
unfortunately
the
same
tendency
to
division
of
labor
has
also
produced
in
scholarship
with
the
sad
result
that
when
the
scholar
attempts
to
minister
to
a
worker
he
gives
him
the
result
of
more
specialization
rather
than
an
offset
from
it
he
can
not
bring
healing
and
solace
because
he
himself
is
suffering
from
the
same
disease
there
is
indeed
a
deplorable
lack
of
perception
and
adaptation
on
the
part
of
educators
all
along
the
line
it
will
certainly
be
embarrassing
to
have
our
age
written
down
triumphant
in
the
matter
of
inventions
in
that
our
factories
were
filled
with
intricate
machines
the
result
of
advancing
mathematical
and
mechanical
knowledge
in
relation
to
manufacturing
processes
but
defeated
in
that
it
lost
its
head
over
the
achievement
and
forgot
the
men
the
accusation
would
stand
that
the
age
failed
to
perform
a
like
service
in
the
extension
of
history
and
art
to
the
factory
employees
who
ran
the
machines
that
the
machine
tenders
heavy
and
almost
dehumanized
by
monotonous
toil
walked
about
in
the
same
streets
with
us
and
sat
in
the
same
cars
but
that
we
were
absolutely
indifferent
and
made
no
genuine
effort
to
supply
to
them
the
artist
perception
or
insight
which
alone
could
fuse
them
into
social
consciousness
it
would
further
stand
that
the
scholars
among
us
continued
with
yet
more
research
that
the
educators
were
concerned
only
with
the
young
and
the
promising
and
the
philanthropists
with
the
criminals
and
helpless
there
is
a
pitiful
failure
to
recognize
the
situation
in
which
the
majority
of
working
people
are
placed
a
tendency
to
ignore
their
real
experiences
and
needs
and
most
stupid
of
all
we
leave
quite
untouched
affections
and
memories
which
would
afford
a
tremendous
dynamic
if
they
were
utilized
we
constantly
hear
it
said
in
educational
circles
that
a
child
learns
only
by
doing
and
that
education
must
proceed
through
the
eyes
and
hands
to
the
brain
and
yet
for
the
vast
number
of
people
all
around
us
who
do
not
need
to
have
activities
artificially
provided
and
who
use
their
hands
and
eyes
all
the
time
we
do
not
seem
able
to
reverse
the
process
we
quote
the
dictum
what
is
learned
in
the
schoolroom
must
be
applied
in
the
workshop
and
yet
the
skill
and
handicraft
constantly
used
in
the
workshop
have
no
relevance
or
meaning
given
to
them
by
the
school
and
when
we
do
try
to
help
the
workingman
in
an
educational
way
we
completely
ignore
his
everyday
occupation
yet
the
task
is
merely
one
of
adaptation
it
is
to
take
actual
conditions
and
to
make
them
the
basis
for
a
large
and
generous
method
of
education
to
perform
a
difficult
idealization
doubtless
but
not
an
impossible
one
we
apparently
believe
that
the
workingman
has
no
chance
to
realize
life
through
his
vocation
we
easily
recognize
the
historic
association
in
regard
to
ancient
buildings
we
say
that
generation
after
generation
have
stamped
their
mark
upon
them
have
recorded
their
thoughts
in
them
until
they
have
become
the
property
of
all
and
yet
this
is
even
more
true
of
the
instruments
of
labor
which
have
constantly
been
held
in
human
hands
a
machine
really
represents
the
seasoned
life
of
man
preserved
and
treasured
up
within
itself
quite
as
much
as
an
ancient
building
does
at
present
workmen
are
brought
in
contact
with
the
machinery
with
which
they
work
as
abruptly
as
if
the
present
set
of
industrial
implements
had
been
newly
created
they
handle
the
machinery
day
by
day
without
any
notion
of
its
gradual
evolution
and
growth
few
of
the
men
who
perform
the
mechanical
work
in
the
great
factories
have
any
comprehension
of
the
fact
that
the
inventions
upon
which
the
factory
depends
the
instruments
which
they
use
have
been
slowly
worked
out
each
generation
using
the
gifts
of
the
last
and
transmitting
the
inheritance
until
it
has
become
a
social
possession
this
can
only
be
understood
by
a
man
who
has
obtained
some
idea
of
social
progress
we
are
still
childishly
pleased
when
we
see
the
further
subdivision
of
labor
going
on
because
the
quantity
of
the
output
is
increased
thereby
and
we
apparently
are
unable
to
take
our
attention
away
from
the
product
long
enough
to
really
focus
it
upon
the
producer
theoretically
the
division
of
labor
makes
men
more
interdependent
and
human
by
drawing
them
together
into
a
unity
of
purpose
if
a
number
of
people
decide
to
build
a
road
and
one
digs
and
one
brings
stones
and
another
breaks
them
they
are
quite
inevitably
united
by
their
interest
in
the
road
but
this
naturally
presupposes
that
they
know
where
the
road
is
going
to
that
they
have
some
curiosity
and
interest
about
it
and
perhaps
a
chance
to
travel
upon
it
if
the
division
of
labor
robs
them
of
interest
in
any
part
of
it
the
mere
mechanical
fact
of
interdependence
amounts
to
nothing
the
man
in
the
factory
as
well
as
the
man
with
the
hoe
has
a
grievance
beyond
being
overworked
and
disinherited
in
that
he
does
not
know
what
it
is
all
about
we
may
well
regret
the
passing
of
the
time
when
the
variety
of
work
performed
in
the
unspecialized
workshop
naturally
stimulated
the
intelligence
of
the
workingmen
and
brought
them
into
contact
both
with
the
raw
material
and
the
finished
product
but
the
problem
of
education
as
any
advanced
educator
will
tell
us
is
to
supply
the
essentials
of
experience
by
a
short
cut
as
it
were
if
the
shop
constantly
tends
to
make
the
workman
a
specialist
then
the
problem
of
the
educator
in
regard
to
him
is
quite
clear
it
is
to
give
him
what
may
be
an
offset
from
the
of
his
daily
work
to
supply
him
with
general
information
and
to
insist
that
he
shall
be
a
cultivated
member
of
society
with
a
consciousness
of
his
industrial
and
social
value
as
sad
a
sight
as
an
old
worker
in
a
factory
attempting
to
make
his
clumsy
machine
compete
with
the
flying
shuttles
about
him
is
a
workingman
equipped
with
knowledge
so
meagre
that
he
can
get
no
meaning
into
his
life
nor
sequence
between
his
acts
and
the
results
manufacturers
as
a
whole
however
when
they
attempt
educational
institutions
in
connection
with
their
factories
are
prone
to
follow
conventional
lines
and
to
exhibit
the
weakness
of
imitation
we
find
indeed
that
the
educator
constantly
makes
the
mistakes
of
the
moralist
when
he
attempts
to
aid
working
people
the
latter
has
constantly
and
traditionally
urged
upon
the
workingman
the
specialized
virtues
of
thrift
industry
and
sobriety
all
virtues
pertaining
to
the
individual
when
each
man
had
his
own
shop
it
was
perhaps
wise
to
lay
almost
exclusive
stress
upon
the
industrial
virtues
of
diligence
and
thrift
but
as
industry
has
become
more
highly
organized
life
becomes
incredibly
complex
and
interdependent
if
a
workingman
is
to
have
a
conception
of
his
value
at
all
he
must
see
industry
in
its
unity
and
entirety
he
must
have
a
conception
that
will
include
not
only
himself
and
his
immediate
family
and
community
but
the
industrial
organization
as
a
whole
it
is
doubtless
true
that
dexterity
of
hand
becomes
less
and
less
imperative
as
the
invention
of
machinery
and
subdivision
of
labor
proceeds
but
it
becomes
all
the
more
necessary
if
the
workman
is
to
save
his
life
at
all
that
he
should
get
a
sense
of
his
individual
relation
to
the
system
feeding
a
machine
with
a
material
of
which
he
has
no
knowledge
producing
a
product
totally
unrelated
to
the
rest
of
his
life
without
in
the
least
knowing
what
becomes
of
it
or
its
connection
with
the
community
is
of
course
unquestionably
deadening
to
his
intellectual
and
moral
life
to
make
the
moral
connection
it
would
be
necessary
to
give
him
a
social
consciousness
of
the
value
of
his
work
and
at
least
a
sense
of
participation
and
a
certain
joy
in
its
ultimate
use
to
make
the
intellectual
connection
it
would
be
essential
to
create
in
him
some
historic
conception
of
the
development
of
industry
and
the
relation
of
his
individual
work
to
it
workingmen
themselves
have
made
attempts
in
both
directions
which
it
would
be
well
for
moralists
and
educators
to
study
it
is
a
striking
fact
that
when
workingmen
formulate
their
own
moral
code
and
try
to
inspire
and
encourage
each
other
it
is
always
a
large
and
general
doctrine
which
they
preach
they
were
the
first
class
of
men
to
organize
an
international
association
and
the
constant
talk
at
a
modern
labor
meeting
is
of
solidarity
and
of
the
identity
of
the
interests
of
workingmen
the
world
over
it
is
difficult
to
secure
a
successful
organization
of
men
into
the
simplest
trades
organization
without
an
appeal
to
the
most
abstract
principles
of
justice
and
brotherhood
as
they
have
formulated
their
own
morals
by
laying
the
greatest
stress
upon
the
largest
morality
so
if
they
could
found
their
own
schools
it
is
doubtful
whether
they
would
be
of
the
mechanic
institute
type
courses
of
study
arranged
by
a
group
of
workingmen
are
most
naïve
in
their
breadth
and
generality
they
will
select
the
history
of
the
world
in
preference
to
that
of
any
period
or
nation
the
wonders
of
science
or
the
story
of
evolution
will
attract
workingmen
to
a
lecture
when
zoölogy
or
chemistry
will
drive
them
away
the
outlines
of
literature
or
the
best
in
literature
will
draw
an
audience
when
a
lecturer
in
english
poetry
will
be
solitary
this
results
partly
from
a
wholesome
desire
to
have
general
knowledge
before
special
knowledge
and
is
partly
a
rebound
from
the
specialization
of
labor
to
which
the
workingman
is
subjected
when
he
is
free
from
work
and
can
direct
his
own
mind
he
tends
to
roam
to
dwell
upon
large
themes
much
the
same
tendency
is
found
in
programmes
of
study
arranged
by
woman
clubs
in
country
places
the
untrained
mind
wearied
with
meaningless
detail
when
it
gets
an
opportunity
to
make
its
demand
heard
asks
for
general
philosophy
and
background
in
a
certain
sense
commercialism
itself
at
least
in
its
larger
aspect
tends
to
educate
the
workingman
better
than
organized
education
does
its
interests
are
certainly
and
democratic
while
it
is
absolutely
undiscriminating
as
to
country
and
creed
coming
into
contact
with
all
climes
and
races
if
this
aspect
of
commercialism
were
utilized
it
would
in
a
measure
counterbalance
the
tendency
which
results
from
the
subdivision
of
labor
the
most
noteworthy
attempt
to
utilize
this
democracy
of
commerce
in
relation
to
manufacturing
is
found
at
dayton
ohio
in
the
yearly
gatherings
held
in
a
large
factory
there
once
a
year
the
entire
force
is
gathered
together
to
hear
the
returns
of
the
business
not
so
much
in
respect
to
the
profits
as
in
regard
to
its
extension
at
these
meetings
the
travelling
salesmen
from
various
parts
of
the
world
from
constantinople
from
berlin
from
rome
from
hong
kong
report
upon
the
sales
they
have
made
and
the
methods
of
advertisement
and
promotion
adapted
to
the
various
countries
stereopticon
lectures
are
given
upon
each
new
country
as
soon
as
it
has
been
successfully
invaded
by
the
product
of
the
factory
the
foremen
in
the
various
departments
of
the
factory
give
accounts
of
the
increased
efficiency
and
the
larger
output
over
former
years
any
man
who
has
made
an
invention
in
connection
with
the
machinery
of
the
factory
at
this
time
publicly
receives
a
prize
and
suggestions
are
approved
that
tend
to
increase
the
comfort
and
social
facilities
of
the
employees
at
least
for
the
moment
there
is
a
complete
esprit
de
corps
and
the
youngest
and
least
skilled
employee
sees
himself
in
connection
with
the
interests
of
the
firm
and
the
spread
of
an
invention
it
is
a
crude
example
of
what
might
be
done
in
the
way
of
giving
a
large
framework
of
meaning
to
factory
labor
and
of
putting
it
into
a
sentient
background
at
least
on
the
commercial
side
it
is
easy
to
indict
the
educator
to
say
that
he
has
gotten
entangled
in
his
own
material
and
has
fallen
a
victim
to
his
own
methods
but
granting
this
what
has
the
artist
done
about
it
he
who
is
supposed
to
have
a
more
intimate
insight
into
the
needs
of
his
contemporaries
and
to
minister
to
them
as
none
other
can
it
is
quite
true
that
a
few
writers
are
insisting
that
the
growing
desire
for
labor
on
the
part
of
many
people
of
leisure
has
its
counterpart
in
the
increasing
desire
for
general
knowledge
on
the
part
of
many
laborers
they
point
to
the
fact
that
the
same
duality
of
conscience
which
seems
to
stifle
the
noblest
effort
in
the
individual
because
his
intellectual
conception
and
his
achievement
are
so
difficult
to
bring
together
is
found
on
a
large
scale
in
society
itself
when
we
have
the
separation
of
the
people
who
think
from
those
who
work
and
yet
since
ruskin
ceased
no
one
has
really
formulated
this
in
a
convincing
form
and
even
ruskin
famous
dictum
that
labor
without
art
brutalizes
has
always
been
interpreted
as
if
art
could
only
be
a
sense
of
beauty
or
joy
in
one
own
work
and
not
a
sense
of
companionship
with
all
other
workers
the
situation
demands
the
consciousness
of
participation
and
which
comes
to
the
individual
when
he
is
able
to
see
himself
in
connection
and
cooperation
with
the
whole
it
needs
the
solace
of
collective
art
inherent
in
collective
labor
as
the
poet
bathes
the
outer
world
for
us
in
the
hues
of
human
feeling
so
the
workman
needs
some
one
to
bathe
his
surroundings
with
a
human
significance
some
one
who
shall
teach
him
to
find
that
which
will
give
a
potency
to
his
life
his
education
however
simple
should
tend
to
make
him
widely
at
home
in
the
world
and
to
give
him
a
sense
of
simplicity
and
peace
in
the
midst
of
the
triviality
and
noise
to
which
he
is
constantly
subjected
he
like
other
men
can
learn
to
be
content
to
see
but
a
part
although
it
must
be
a
part
of
something
it
is
because
of
a
lack
of
democracy
that
we
do
not
really
incorporate
him
in
the
hopes
and
advantages
of
society
and
give
him
the
place
which
is
his
by
simple
right
we
have
learned
to
say
that
the
good
must
be
extended
to
all
of
society
before
it
can
be
held
secure
by
any
one
person
or
any
one
class
but
we
have
not
yet
learned
to
add
to
that
statement
that
unless
all
men
and
all
classes
contribute
to
a
good
we
can
not
even
be
sure
that
it
is
worth
having
in
spite
of
many
attempts
we
do
not
really
act
upon
either
statement
chapter
vii
political
reform
throughout
this
volume
we
have
assumed
that
much
of
our
ethical
maladjustment
in
social
affairs
arises
from
the
fact
that
we
are
acting
upon
a
code
of
ethics
adapted
to
individual
relationships
but
not
to
the
larger
social
relationships
to
which
it
is
bunglingly
applied
in
addition
however
to
the
consequent
strain
and
difficulty
there
is
often
an
honest
lack
of
perception
as
to
what
the
situation
demands
nowhere
is
this
more
obvious
than
in
our
political
life
as
it
manifests
itself
in
certain
quarters
of
every
great
city
it
is
most
difficult
to
hold
to
our
political
democracy
and
to
make
it
in
any
sense
a
social
expression
and
not
a
mere
governmental
contrivance
unless
we
take
pains
to
keep
on
common
ground
in
our
human
experiences
otherwise
there
is
in
various
parts
of
the
community
an
inevitable
difference
of
ethical
standards
which
becomes
responsible
for
much
misunderstanding
it
is
difficult
both
to
interpret
sympathetically
the
motives
and
ideals
of
those
who
have
acquired
rules
of
conduct
in
experience
widely
different
from
our
own
and
also
to
take
enough
care
in
guarding
the
gains
already
made
and
in
valuing
highly
enough
the
imperfect
good
so
painfully
acquired
and
at
the
best
so
mixed
with
evil
this
wide
difference
in
daily
experience
exhibits
itself
in
two
distinct
attitudes
toward
politics
the
men
of
the
community
think
of
politics
as
something
off
by
itself
they
may
conscientiously
recognize
political
duty
as
part
of
good
citizenship
but
political
effort
is
not
the
expression
of
their
moral
or
social
life
as
a
result
of
this
detachment
reform
movements
started
by
business
men
and
the
better
element
are
almost
wholly
occupied
in
the
correction
of
political
machinery
and
with
a
concern
for
the
better
method
of
administration
rather
than
with
the
ultimate
purpose
of
securing
the
welfare
of
the
people
they
fix
their
attention
so
exclusively
on
methods
that
they
fail
to
consider
the
final
aims
of
city
government
this
accounts
for
the
growing
tendency
to
put
more
and
more
responsibility
upon
executive
officers
and
appointed
commissions
at
the
expense
of
curtailing
the
power
of
the
direct
representatives
of
the
voters
reform
movements
tend
to
become
negative
and
to
lose
their
educational
value
for
the
mass
of
the
people
the
reformers
take
the
rôle
of
the
opposition
they
give
themselves
largely
to
criticisms
of
the
present
state
of
affairs
to
writing
and
talking
of
what
the
future
must
be
and
of
certain
results
which
should
be
obtained
in
trying
to
better
matters
however
they
have
in
mind
only
political
achievements
which
they
detach
in
a
curious
way
from
the
rest
of
life
and
they
speak
and
write
of
the
purification
of
politics
as
of
a
thing
set
apart
from
daily
life
on
the
other
hand
the
real
leaders
of
the
people
are
part
of
the
entire
life
of
the
community
which
they
control
and
so
far
as
they
are
representative
at
all
are
giving
a
social
expression
to
democracy
they
are
often
politically
corrupt
but
in
spite
of
this
they
are
proceeding
upon
a
sounder
theory
although
they
would
be
totally
unable
to
give
it
abstract
expression
they
are
really
acting
upon
a
formulation
made
by
a
shrewd
english
observer
namely
that
after
the
enfranchisement
of
the
masses
social
ideals
enter
into
political
programmes
and
they
enter
not
as
something
which
at
best
can
be
indirectly
promoted
by
government
but
as
something
which
it
is
the
chief
business
of
government
to
advance
directly
men
living
near
to
the
masses
of
voters
and
knowing
them
intimately
recognize
this
and
act
upon
it
they
minister
directly
to
life
and
to
social
needs
they
realize
that
the
people
as
a
whole
are
clamoring
for
social
results
and
they
hold
their
power
because
they
respond
to
that
demand
they
are
corrupt
and
often
do
their
work
badly
but
they
at
least
avoid
the
mistake
of
a
certain
type
of
business
men
who
are
frightened
by
democracy
and
have
lost
their
faith
in
the
people
the
two
standards
are
similar
to
those
seen
at
a
popular
exhibition
of
pictures
where
the
cultivated
people
care
most
for
the
technique
of
a
given
painting
the
moving
mass
for
a
subject
that
shall
be
domestic
and
human
this
difference
may
be
illustrated
by
the
writer
experience
in
a
certain
ward
of
chicago
during
three
campaigns
when
efforts
were
made
to
dislodge
an
alderman
who
had
represented
the
ward
for
many
years
in
this
ward
there
are
gathered
together
fifty
thousand
people
representing
a
score
of
nationalities
the
newly
emigrated
latin
teuton
celt
greek
and
slav
who
live
there
have
little
in
common
save
the
basic
experiences
which
come
to
men
in
all
countries
and
under
all
conditions
in
order
to
make
fifty
thousand
people
so
heterogeneous
in
nationality
religion
and
customs
agree
upon
any
demand
it
must
be
founded
upon
universal
experiences
which
are
perforce
individual
and
not
social
an
instinctive
recognition
of
this
on
the
part
of
the
alderman
makes
it
possible
to
understand
the
individualistic
basis
of
his
political
success
but
it
remains
extremely
difficult
to
ascertain
the
reasons
for
the
extreme
leniency
of
judgment
concerning
the
political
corruption
of
which
he
is
constantly
guilty
this
leniency
is
only
to
be
explained
on
the
ground
that
his
constituents
greatly
admire
individual
virtues
and
that
they
are
at
the
same
time
unable
to
perceive
social
outrages
which
the
alderman
may
be
committing
they
thus
free
the
alderman
from
blame
because
his
corruption
is
social
and
they
honestly
admire
him
as
a
great
man
and
hero
because
his
individual
acts
are
on
the
whole
kindly
and
generous
in
certain
stages
of
moral
evolution
a
man
is
incapable
of
action
unless
the
results
will
benefit
himself
or
some
one
of
his
acquaintances
and
it
is
a
long
step
in
moral
progress
to
set
the
good
of
the
many
before
the
interest
of
the
few
and
to
be
concerned
for
the
welfare
of
a
community
without
hope
of
an
individual
return
how
far
the
selfish
politician
befools
his
constituents
into
believing
that
their
interests
are
identical
with
his
own
how
far
he
presumes
upon
their
inability
to
distinguish
between
the
individual
and
social
virtues
an
inability
which
he
himself
shares
with
them
and
how
far
he
dazzles
them
by
the
sense
of
his
greatness
and
a
conviction
that
they
participate
therein
it
is
difficult
to
determine
morality
certainly
develops
far
earlier
in
the
form
of
moral
fact
than
in
the
form
of
moral
ideas
and
it
is
obvious
that
ideas
only
operate
upon
the
popular
mind
through
will
and
character
and
must
be
dramatized
before
they
reach
the
mass
of
men
even
as
the
biography
of
the
saints
have
been
after
all
the
main
guide
to
the
stumbling
feet
of
thousands
of
christians
to
whom
the
credo
has
been
but
mysterious
words
ethics
as
well
as
political
opinions
may
be
discussed
and
disseminated
among
the
sophisticated
by
lectures
and
printed
pages
but
to
the
common
people
they
can
only
come
through
example
through
a
personality
which
seizes
the
popular
imagination
the
advantage
of
an
unsophisticated
neighborhood
is
that
the
inhabitants
do
not
keep
their
ideas
as
treasures
they
are
untouched
by
the
notion
of
accumulating
them
as
they
might
knowledge
or
money
and
they
frankly
act
upon
those
they
have
the
personal
example
promptly
rouses
to
emulation
in
a
neighborhood
where
political
standards
are
plastic
and
undeveloped
and
where
there
has
been
little
previous
experience
in
the
himself
sets
the
standard
and
the
ideas
that
cluster
around
him
exercise
a
specific
and
permanent
influence
upon
the
political
morality
of
his
constituents
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
the
quality
which
a
heterogeneous
population
living
in
one
of
the
less
sophisticated
wards
most
admires
is
the
quality
of
simple
goodness
that
the
man
who
attracts
them
is
the
one
whom
they
believe
to
be
a
good
man
we
all
know
that
children
long
to
be
good
with
an
intensity
which
they
give
to
no
other
ambition
we
can
all
remember
that
the
earliest
strivings
of
our
childhood
were
in
this
direction
and
that
we
venerated
grown
people
because
they
had
attained
perfection
primitive
people
such
as
the
south
italian
peasants
are
still
in
this
stage
they
want
to
be
good
and
deep
down
in
their
hearts
they
admire
nothing
so
much
as
the
good
man
abstract
virtues
are
too
difficult
for
their
untrained
minds
to
apprehend
and
many
of
them
are
still
simple
enough
to
believe
that
power
and
wealth
come
only
to
good
people
the
successful
candidate
then
must
be
a
good
man
according
to
the
morality
of
his
constituents
he
must
not
attempt
to
hold
up
too
high
a
standard
nor
must
he
attempt
to
reform
or
change
their
standards
his
safety
lies
in
doing
on
a
large
scale
the
good
deeds
which
his
constituents
are
able
to
do
only
on
a
small
scale
if
he
believes
what
they
believe
and
does
what
they
are
all
cherishing
a
secret
ambition
to
do
he
will
dazzle
them
by
his
success
and
win
their
confidence
there
is
a
certain
wisdom
in
this
course
there
is
a
common
sense
in
the
mass
of
men
which
can
not
be
neglected
with
impunity
just
as
there
is
sure
to
be
an
eccentricity
in
the
differing
and
reforming
individual
which
it
is
perhaps
well
to
challenge
the
constant
kindness
of
the
poor
to
each
other
was
pointed
out
in
a
previous
chapter
and
that
they
unfailingly
respond
to
the
need
and
distresses
of
their
poorer
neighbors
even
when
in
danger
of
bankruptcy
themselves
the
kindness
which
a
poor
man
shows
his
distressed
neighbor
is
doubtless
heightened
by
the
consciousness
that
he
himself
may
be
in
distress
next
week
he
therefore
stands
by
his
friend
when
he
gets
too
drunk
to
take
care
of
himself
when
he
loses
his
wife
or
child
when
he
is
evicted
for
of
rent
when
he
is
arrested
for
a
petty
crime
it
seems
to
such
a
man
entirely
fitting
that
his
alderman
should
do
the
same
thing
on
a
larger
scale
that
he
should
help
a
constituent
out
of
trouble
merely
because
he
is
in
trouble
irrespective
of
the
justice
involved
the
alderman
therefore
bails
out
his
constituents
when
they
are
arrested
or
says
a
good
word
to
the
police
justice
when
they
appear
before
him
for
trial
uses
his
pull
with
the
magistrate
when
they
are
likely
to
be
fined
for
a
civil
misdemeanor
or
sees
what
he
can
do
to
fix
up
matters
with
the
state
attorney
when
the
charge
is
really
a
serious
one
and
in
doing
this
he
follows
the
ethics
held
and
practised
by
his
constituents
all
this
conveys
the
impression
to
the
that
law
is
not
enforced
if
the
lawbreaker
have
a
powerful
friend
one
may
instance
the
alderman
action
in
standing
by
an
italian
padrone
of
the
ward
when
he
was
indicted
for
violating
the
civil
service
regulations
the
commissioners
had
sent
out
notices
to
certain
italian
who
were
upon
the
eligible
list
that
they
were
to
report
for
work
at
a
given
day
and
hour
one
of
the
padrones
intercepted
these
notifications
and
sold
them
to
the
men
for
five
dollars
apiece
making
also
the
usual
bargain
for
a
share
of
their
wages
the
padrone
entire
arrangement
followed
the
custom
which
had
prevailed
for
years
before
the
establishment
of
civil
service
laws
ten
of
the
laborers
swore
out
warrants
against
the
padrone
who
was
convicted
and
fined
dollars
this
sum
was
promptly
paid
by
the
alderman
and
the
padrone
assured
that
he
would
be
protected
from
any
further
trouble
returned
uninjured
to
the
colony
the
simple
italians
were
much
bewildered
by
this
show
of
a
power
stronger
than
that
of
the
civil
service
which
they
had
trusted
as
they
did
the
one
in
italy
the
first
violation
of
its
authority
was
made
and
various
sinister
acts
have
followed
until
no
italian
who
is
digging
a
sewer
or
sweeping
a
street
for
the
city
feels
quite
secure
in
holding
his
job
unless
he
is
backed
by
the
friendship
of
the
alderman
according
to
the
civil
service
law
a
laborer
has
no
right
to
a
trial
many
are
discharged
by
the
foreman
and
find
that
they
can
be
reinstated
only
upon
the
aldermanic
recommendation
he
thus
practically
holds
his
old
power
over
the
laborers
working
for
the
city
the
popular
mind
is
convinced
that
an
honest
administration
of
civil
service
is
impossible
and
that
it
is
but
one
more
instrument
in
the
hands
of
the
powerful
it
will
be
difficult
to
establish
genuine
civil
service
among
these
men
who
learn
only
by
experience
since
their
experiences
have
been
of
such
a
nature
that
their
unanimous
vote
would
certainly
be
that
civil
service
is
no
good
as
many
of
his
constituents
in
this
case
are
impressed
with
the
fact
that
the
aldermanic
power
is
superior
to
that
of
government
so
instances
of
actual
lawbreaking
might
easily
be
cited
a
young
man
may
enter
a
saloon
long
after
midnight
the
legal
closing
hour
and
seat
himself
at
a
gambling
table
perfectly
secure
from
interruption
or
arrest
because
the
place
belongs
to
an
alderman
but
in
order
to
secure
this
immunity
the
policeman
on
the
beat
must
pretend
not
to
see
into
the
windows
each
time
that
he
passes
and
he
knows
and
the
young
man
knows
that
he
knows
that
nothing
would
embarrass
headquarters
more
than
to
have
an
arrest
made
on
those
premises
a
certain
contempt
for
the
whole
machinery
of
law
and
order
is
thus
easily
fostered
because
of
simple
friendliness
the
alderman
is
expected
to
pay
rent
for
the
tenant
when
no
rent
is
forthcoming
to
find
jobs
when
work
is
hard
to
get
to
procure
and
divide
among
his
constituents
all
the
places
which
he
can
seize
from
the
city
hall
the
alderman
of
the
ward
we
are
considering
at
one
time
could
make
the
proud
boast
that
he
had
hundred
people
in
his
ward
upon
the
public
this
of
course
included
day
laborers
but
each
one
felt
under
distinct
obligations
to
him
for
getting
a
position
when
we
reflect
that
this
is
of
the
entire
vote
of
the
ward
we
realize
that
it
is
very
important
to
vote
for
the
right
man
since
there
is
at
the
least
one
chance
out
of
three
for
securing
work
if
we
recollect
further
that
the
companies
pay
respectful
heed
to
the
applicants
backed
by
the
alderman
the
question
of
voting
for
the
successful
man
becomes
as
much
an
industrial
one
as
a
political
one
an
italian
laborer
wants
a
job
more
than
anything
else
and
quite
simply
votes
for
the
man
who
promises
him
one
it
is
not
so
different
from
his
relation
to
the
padrone
and
indeed
the
two
strengthen
each
other
the
alderman
may
himself
be
quite
sincere
in
his
acts
of
kindness
for
an
office
seeker
may
begin
with
the
simple
desire
to
alleviate
suffering
and
this
may
gradually
change
into
the
desire
to
put
his
constituents
under
obligations
to
him
but
the
action
of
such
an
individual
becomes
a
demoralizing
element
in
the
community
when
kindly
impulse
is
made
a
cloak
for
the
satisfaction
of
personal
ambition
and
when
the
plastic
morals
of
his
constituents
gradually
conform
to
his
own
undeveloped
standards
the
alderman
gives
presents
at
weddings
and
christenings
he
seizes
these
days
of
family
festivities
for
making
friends
it
is
easiest
to
reach
them
in
the
holiday
mood
of
expansive
but
on
their
side
it
seems
natural
and
kindly
that
he
should
do
it
the
alderman
procures
passes
from
the
railroads
when
his
constituents
wish
to
visit
friends
or
attend
the
funerals
of
distant
relatives
he
buys
tickets
galore
for
benefit
entertainments
given
for
a
widow
or
a
consumptive
in
peculiar
distress
he
contributes
to
prizes
which
are
awarded
to
the
handsomest
lady
or
the
most
popular
man
at
a
church
bazaar
for
instance
the
alderman
finds
the
stage
all
set
for
his
dramatic
performance
when
others
are
spending
pennies
he
is
spending
dollars
when
anxious
relatives
are
canvassing
to
secure
votes
for
the
two
most
beautiful
children
who
are
being
voted
upon
he
recklessly
buys
votes
from
both
sides
and
laughingly
declines
to
say
which
one
he
likes
best
buying
off
the
young
lady
who
is
persistently
determined
to
find
out
with
five
dollars
for
the
flower
bazaar
the
posies
of
course
to
be
sent
to
the
sick
of
the
parish
the
moral
atmosphere
of
a
bazaar
suits
him
exactly
he
murmurs
many
times
never
mind
the
money
all
goes
to
the
poor
it
is
all
straight
enough
if
the
church
gets
it
the
poor
wo
ask
too
many
questions
the
oftener
he
can
put
such
sentiments
into
the
minds
of
his
constituents
the
better
he
is
pleased
nothing
so
rapidly
prepares
them
to
take
his
view
of
money
getting
and
money
spending
we
see
again
the
process
disregarded
because
the
end
itself
is
considered
so
praiseworthy
there
is
something
archaic
in
a
community
of
simple
people
in
their
attitude
toward
death
and
burial
there
is
nothing
so
easy
to
collect
money
for
as
a
funeral
and
one
involuntarily
remembers
that
the
early
religious
tithes
were
paid
to
ward
off
death
and
ghosts
at
times
one
encounters
almost
the
greek
feeling
in
regard
to
burial
if
the
alderman
seizes
upon
times
of
festivities
for
expressions
of
his
much
more
does
he
seize
upon
periods
of
sorrow
at
a
funeral
he
has
the
double
advantage
of
ministering
to
a
genuine
craving
for
comfort
and
solace
and
at
the
same
time
of
assisting
a
bereaved
constituent
to
express
that
curious
feeling
of
remorse
which
is
ever
an
accompaniment
of
quick
sorrow
that
desire
to
make
up
for
past
delinquencies
to
show
the
world
how
much
he
loved
the
person
who
has
just
died
which
is
as
natural
as
it
is
universal
in
addition
to
this
there
is
among
the
poor
who
have
few
social
occasions
a
great
desire
for
a
funeral
the
grade
of
which
almost
determines
their
social
standing
in
the
neighborhood
the
alderman
saves
the
very
poorest
of
his
constituents
from
that
awful
horror
of
burial
by
the
county
he
provides
carriages
for
the
poor
who
otherwise
could
not
have
them
it
may
be
too
much
to
say
that
all
the
relatives
and
friends
who
ride
in
the
carriages
provided
by
the
alderman
bounty
vote
for
him
but
they
are
certainly
influenced
by
his
kindness
and
talk
of
his
virtues
during
the
long
hours
of
the
ride
back
and
forth
from
the
suburban
cemetery
a
man
who
would
ask
at
such
a
time
where
all
the
money
thus
spent
comes
from
would
be
considered
sinister
the
tendency
to
speak
lightly
of
the
faults
of
the
dead
and
to
judge
them
gently
is
transferred
to
the
living
and
many
a
man
at
such
a
time
has
formulated
a
lenient
judgment
of
political
corruption
and
has
heard
kindly
speeches
which
he
has
remembered
on
election
day
ah
well
he
has
a
big
irish
heart
he
is
good
to
the
widow
and
the
fatherless
he
knows
the
poor
better
than
the
big
guns
who
are
always
talking
about
civil
service
and
reform
indeed
what
headway
can
the
notion
of
civic
purity
of
honesty
of
administration
make
against
this
big
manifestation
of
human
friendliness
this
stalking
survival
of
village
kindness
the
notions
of
the
civic
reformer
are
negative
and
impotent
before
it
such
an
alderman
will
keep
a
standing
account
with
an
undertaker
and
telephone
every
week
and
sometimes
more
than
once
the
kind
of
funeral
he
wishes
provided
for
a
bereaved
constituent
until
the
sum
may
roll
up
into
hundreds
a
year
he
understands
what
the
people
want
and
ministers
just
as
truly
to
a
great
human
need
as
the
musician
or
the
artist
an
attempt
to
substitute
what
we
might
call
a
later
standard
was
made
at
one
time
when
a
delicate
little
child
was
deserted
in
the
nursery
an
investigation
showed
that
it
had
been
born
ten
days
previously
in
the
cook
county
hospital
but
no
trace
could
be
found
of
the
unfortunate
mother
the
little
child
lived
for
several
weeks
and
then
in
spite
of
every
care
died
it
was
decided
to
have
it
buried
by
the
county
authorities
and
the
wagon
was
to
arrive
at
eleven
about
nine
in
the
morning
the
rumor
of
this
awful
deed
reached
the
neighbors
a
half
dozen
of
them
came
in
a
very
excited
state
of
mind
to
protest
they
took
up
a
collection
out
of
their
poverty
with
which
to
defray
a
funeral
the
residents
of
were
then
comparatively
new
in
the
neighborhood
and
did
not
realize
that
they
were
really
shocking
a
genuine
moral
sentiment
of
the
community
in
their
crudeness
they
instanced
the
care
and
tenderness
which
had
been
expended
upon
the
little
creature
while
it
was
alive
that
it
had
had
every
attention
from
a
skilled
physician
and
a
trained
nurse
and
even
intimated
that
the
excited
members
of
the
group
had
not
taken
part
in
this
and
that
it
now
lay
with
the
nursery
to
decide
that
it
should
be
buried
as
it
had
been
born
at
the
county
expense
it
is
doubtful
if
has
ever
done
anything
which
injured
it
so
deeply
in
the
minds
of
some
of
its
neighbors
it
was
only
forgiven
by
the
most
indulgent
on
the
ground
that
the
residents
were
spinsters
and
could
not
know
a
mother
heart
no
one
born
and
reared
in
the
community
could
possibly
have
made
a
mistake
like
that
no
one
who
had
studied
the
ethical
standards
with
any
care
could
have
bungled
so
completely
we
are
constantly
underestimating
the
amount
of
sentiment
among
simple
people
the
songs
which
are
most
popular
among
them
are
those
of
a
reminiscent
old
age
in
which
the
ripened
soul
calmly
recounts
and
regrets
the
sins
of
his
youth
songs
in
which
the
wayward
daughter
is
forgiven
by
her
loving
parents
in
which
the
lovers
are
magnanimous
and
faithful
through
all
vicissitudes
the
tendency
is
to
condone
and
forgive
and
not
hold
too
rigidly
to
a
standard
in
the
theatres
it
is
the
magnanimous
man
the
kindly
reckless
villain
who
is
always
applauded
so
shrewd
an
observer
as
samuel
johnson
once
remarked
that
it
was
surprising
to
find
how
much
more
kindness
than
justice
society
contained
on
the
same
basis
the
alderman
manages
several
saloons
one
down
town
within
easy
access
of
the
city
hall
where
he
can
catch
the
more
important
of
his
friends
here
again
he
has
seized
upon
an
old
tradition
and
primitive
custom
the
good
fellowship
which
has
long
been
best
expressed
when
men
drink
together
the
saloons
offer
a
common
meeting
ground
with
stimulus
enough
to
free
the
wits
and
tongues
of
the
men
who
meet
there
he
distributes
each
christmas
many
tons
of
turkeys
not
only
to
voters
but
to
families
who
are
represented
by
no
vote
by
a
judicious
management
some
families
get
three
or
four
turkeys
apiece
but
what
of
that
the
alderman
has
none
of
the
nagging
rules
of
the
charitable
societies
nor
does
he
declare
that
because
a
man
wants
two
turkeys
for
christmas
he
is
a
scoundrel
who
shall
never
be
allowed
to
eat
turkey
again
as
he
does
not
distribute
his
christmas
favors
from
any
hardly
acquired
philanthropic
motive
there
is
no
disposition
to
apply
the
carefully
evolved
rules
of
the
charitable
societies
to
his
beneficiaries
of
course
there
are
those
who
suspect
that
the
benevolence
rests
upon
motives
and
feel
themselves
quite
freed
from
any
sense
of
gratitude
others
go
further
and
glory
in
the
fact
that
they
can
thus
soak
the
alderman
an
example
of
this
is
the
young
man
who
fills
his
pockets
with
a
handful
of
cigars
giving
a
sly
wink
at
the
others
but
this
freedom
from
any
sense
of
obligation
is
often
the
first
step
downward
to
the
position
where
he
is
willing
to
sell
his
vote
to
both
parties
and
then
scratch
his
ticket
as
he
pleases
the
writer
recalls
a
conversation
with
a
man
in
which
he
complained
quite
openly
and
with
no
sense
of
shame
that
his
vote
had
sold
for
only
two
dollars
this
year
and
that
he
was
awfully
disappointed
the
writer
happened
to
know
that
his
income
during
the
nine
months
previous
had
been
but
dollars
and
that
he
was
in
debt
dollars
and
she
could
well
imagine
the
eagerness
with
which
he
had
counted
upon
this
source
of
revenue
after
some
years
the
selling
of
votes
becomes
a
commonplace
and
but
little
attempt
is
made
upon
the
part
of
the
buyer
or
seller
to
conceal
the
fact
if
the
transaction
runs
smoothly
a
certain
keeper
at
one
time
sold
the
votes
of
his
entire
house
to
a
political
party
and
was
well
paid
for
it
too
but
being
of
a
grasping
turn
he
also
sold
the
house
for
the
same
election
to
the
rival
party
such
an
outrage
could
not
be
borne
the
man
was
treated
to
a
modern
version
of
tar
and
feathers
and
as
a
result
of
being
held
under
a
street
hydrant
in
november
contracted
pneumonia
which
resulted
in
his
death
no
official
investigation
took
place
since
the
certificate
of
pneumonia
was
sufficient
for
legal
burial
and
public
sentiment
sustained
the
action
in
various
conversations
which
the
writer
had
concerning
the
entire
transaction
she
discovered
great
indignation
concerning
his
duplicity
and
treachery
but
none
whatever
for
his
original
offence
of
selling
out
the
votes
of
his
house
a
club
will
be
started
for
the
express
purpose
of
gaining
a
reputation
for
political
power
which
may
later
be
sold
out
the
president
and
executive
committee
of
such
a
club
who
will
naturally
receive
the
funds
promise
to
divide
with
the
boys
who
swell
the
size
of
the
membership
a
reform
movement
is
at
first
filled
with
recruits
who
are
active
and
loud
in
their
assertions
of
the
number
of
votes
they
can
deliver
the
reformers
are
delighted
with
this
display
of
zeal
and
only
gradually
find
out
that
many
of
the
recruits
are
there
for
the
express
purpose
of
being
bought
by
the
other
side
that
they
are
most
active
in
order
to
seem
valuable
and
thus
raise
the
price
of
their
allegiance
when
they
are
ready
to
sell
reformers
seeing
them
drop
away
one
by
one
talk
of
desertion
from
the
ranks
of
reform
and
of
the
power
of
money
over
men
who
are
too
weak
to
withstand
temptation
but
in
reality
the
men
are
not
deserters
because
they
have
never
actually
been
enrolled
in
the
ranks
the
money
they
take
is
neither
a
bribe
nor
the
price
of
their
loyalty
it
is
simply
the
consummation
of
a
plan
and
a
reward
they
came
into
the
new
movement
for
the
purpose
of
being
bought
out
of
it
and
have
successfully
accomplished
that
purpose
assisted
in
carrying
on
two
unsuccessful
campaigns
against
the
same
alderman
in
the
two
years
following
the
end
of
the
first
one
nearly
every
man
who
had
been
prominent
in
it
had
received
an
office
from
the
reëlected
alderman
a
printer
had
been
appointed
to
a
clerkship
in
the
city
hall
a
driver
received
a
large
salary
for
services
in
the
police
barns
the
candidate
himself
a
bricklayer
held
a
position
in
the
city
construction
department
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
campaign
the
greatest
difficulty
was
experienced
in
finding
a
candidate
and
each
one
proposed
demanded
time
to
consider
the
proposition
during
this
period
he
invariably
became
the
recipient
of
the
alderman
bounty
the
first
one
who
was
foreman
of
a
large
factory
was
reported
to
have
been
bought
off
by
the
promise
that
the
city
institutions
would
use
the
product
of
his
firm
the
second
one
a
keeper
of
a
grocery
and
family
saloon
with
large
popularity
was
promised
the
aldermanic
nomination
on
the
regular
ticket
at
the
expiration
of
the
term
of
office
held
by
the
alderman
colleague
and
it
may
be
well
to
state
in
passing
that
he
was
thus
nominated
and
successfully
elected
the
third
proposed
candidate
received
a
place
for
his
son
in
the
office
of
the
city
attorney
not
only
are
offices
in
his
gift
but
all
smaller
favors
as
well
any
requests
to
the
council
or
special
licenses
must
be
presented
by
the
alderman
of
the
ward
in
which
the
person
desiring
the
favor
resides
there
is
thus
constant
opportunity
for
the
alderman
to
put
his
constituents
under
obligations
to
him
to
make
it
difficult
for
a
constituent
to
withstand
him
or
for
one
with
large
interests
to
enter
into
political
action
at
all
from
the
italian
pedler
who
wants
a
license
to
peddle
fruit
in
the
street
to
the
large
manufacturing
company
who
desires
to
tunnel
an
alley
for
the
sake
of
conveying
pipes
from
one
building
to
another
everybody
is
under
obligations
to
his
alderman
and
is
constantly
made
to
feel
it
in
short
these
very
regulations
for
presenting
requests
to
the
council
have
been
made
by
the
aldermen
themselves
for
the
express
purpose
of
increasing
the
dependence
of
their
constituents
and
thereby
augmenting
aldermanic
power
and
prestige
the
alderman
has
also
a
very
singular
hold
upon
the
property
owners
of
his
ward
the
paving
both
of
the
streets
and
sidewalks
throughout
his
district
is
disgraceful
and
in
the
election
speeches
the
reform
side
holds
him
responsible
for
this
condition
and
promises
better
paving
under
another
régime
but
the
paving
could
not
be
made
better
without
a
special
assessment
upon
the
property
owners
of
the
vicinity
and
paying
more
taxes
is
exactly
what
his
constituents
do
not
want
to
do
in
reality
getting
them
off
or
at
the
worst
postponing
the
time
of
the
improvement
is
one
of
the
genuine
favors
which
he
performs
a
movement
to
have
the
paving
done
from
a
general
fund
would
doubtless
be
opposed
by
the
property
owners
in
other
parts
of
the
city
who
have
already
paid
for
the
asphalt
bordering
their
own
possessions
but
they
have
no
conception
of
the
struggle
and
possible
bankruptcy
which
repaving
may
mean
to
the
small
property
owner
nor
how
his
chief
concern
may
be
to
elect
an
alderman
who
cares
more
for
the
feelings
and
of
his
constituents
than
he
does
for
the
repute
and
cleanliness
of
his
city
the
alderman
exhibited
great
wisdom
in
procuring
from
certain
of
his
friends
the
sum
of
three
thousand
dollars
with
which
to
uniform
and
equip
a
boys
temperance
brigade
which
had
been
formed
in
one
of
the
ward
churches
a
few
months
before
his
campaign
is
it
strange
that
the
good
leader
whose
heart
was
filled
with
innocent
pride
as
he
looked
upon
these
promising
young
scions
of
virtue
should
decline
to
enter
into
a
reform
campaign
of
what
use
to
suggest
that
uniforms
and
bayonets
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
temperance
bought
with
money
contributed
by
a
man
who
was
proprietor
of
a
saloon
and
a
gambling
house
might
perhaps
confuse
the
ethics
of
the
young
soldiers
why
take
the
pains
to
urge
that
it
was
vain
to
lecture
and
march
abstract
virtues
into
them
so
long
as
the
champion
boodler
of
the
town
was
the
man
whom
the
boys
recognized
as
a
loyal
and
kindhearted
friend
the
citizen
whom
their
fathers
enthusiastically
voted
for
and
their
mothers
called
the
friend
of
the
poor
as
long
as
the
actual
and
tangible
success
is
thus
embodied
marching
whether
in
kindergartens
or
brigades
talking
whether
in
clubs
or
classes
does
little
to
change
the
code
of
ethics
the
question
of
where
does
the
money
come
from
which
is
spent
so
successfully
does
of
course
occur
to
many
minds
the
more
primitive
people
accept
the
truthful
statement
of
its
sources
without
any
shock
to
their
moral
sense
to
their
simple
minds
he
gets
it
from
the
rich
and
so
long
as
he
again
gives
it
out
to
the
poor
as
a
true
robin
hood
with
open
hand
they
have
no
objections
to
offer
their
ethics
are
quite
honestly
those
of
the
foresters
the
next
less
primitive
people
of
the
vicinage
are
quite
willing
to
admit
that
he
leads
the
gang
in
the
city
council
and
sells
out
the
city
franchises
that
he
makes
deals
with
the
companies
that
he
guarantees
to
steer
dubious
measures
through
the
council
for
which
he
demands
liberal
pay
that
he
is
in
short
a
successful
boodler
when
however
there
is
intellect
enough
to
get
this
point
of
view
there
is
also
enough
to
make
the
contention
that
this
is
universally
done
that
all
the
aldermen
do
it
more
or
less
successfully
but
that
the
alderman
of
this
particular
ward
is
unique
in
being
so
generous
that
such
a
state
of
affairs
is
to
be
deplored
of
course
but
that
that
is
the
way
business
is
run
and
we
are
fortunate
when
a
man
who
is
close
to
the
people
gets
a
large
share
of
the
spoils
that
he
serves
franchised
companies
who
employ
men
in
the
building
and
construction
of
their
enterprises
and
that
they
are
bound
in
return
to
give
work
to
his
constituents
it
is
again
the
justification
of
stealing
from
the
rich
to
give
to
the
poor
even
when
they
are
intelligent
enough
to
complete
the
circle
and
to
see
that
the
money
comes
not
from
the
pockets
of
the
companies
agents
but
from
the
fares
of
people
like
themselves
it
almost
seems
as
if
they
would
rather
pay
two
cents
more
each
time
they
ride
than
to
give
up
the
consciousness
that
they
have
a
big
friend
at
court
who
will
stand
by
them
in
an
emergency
the
sense
of
just
dealing
comes
apparently
much
later
than
the
desire
for
protection
and
indulgence
on
the
whole
the
gifts
and
favors
are
taken
quite
simply
as
an
evidence
of
genuine
the
alderman
is
really
elected
because
he
is
a
good
friend
and
neighbor
he
is
corrupt
of
course
but
he
is
not
elected
because
he
is
corrupt
but
rather
in
spite
of
it
his
standard
suits
his
constituents
he
exemplifies
and
exaggerates
the
popular
type
of
a
good
man
he
has
attained
what
his
constituents
secretly
long
for
at
one
end
of
the
ward
there
is
a
street
of
good
houses
familiarly
called
con
row
the
term
is
perhaps
quite
unjustly
used
but
it
is
nevertheless
universally
applied
because
many
of
these
houses
are
occupied
by
professional
office
holders
this
row
is
supposed
to
form
a
happy
of
the
successful
politician
where
he
can
live
in
prosperity
and
still
maintain
his
vote
and
influence
in
the
ward
it
would
be
difficult
to
justly
estimate
the
influence
which
this
group
of
successful
prominent
men
including
the
alderman
who
lives
there
have
had
upon
the
ideals
of
the
youth
in
the
vicinity
the
path
which
leads
to
riches
and
success
to
civic
prominence
and
honor
is
the
path
of
political
corruption
we
might
compare
this
to
the
path
laid
out
by
benjamin
franklin
who
also
secured
all
of
these
things
but
told
young
men
that
they
could
be
obtained
only
by
strenuous
effort
and
frugal
living
by
the
cultivation
of
the
mind
and
the
holding
fast
to
righteousness
or
again
we
might
compare
it
to
the
ideals
which
were
held
up
to
the
american
youth
fifty
years
ago
lower
to
be
sure
than
the
revolutionary
ideal
but
still
fine
and
aspiring
toward
honorable
dealing
and
careful
living
they
were
told
that
the
career
of
the
man
was
open
to
every
american
boy
if
he
worked
hard
and
saved
his
money
improved
his
mind
and
followed
a
steady
ambition
the
writer
remembers
that
when
she
was
ten
years
old
the
village
schoolmaster
told
his
little
flock
without
any
mitigating
clauses
that
jay
gould
had
laid
the
foundation
of
his
colossal
fortune
by
always
saving
bits
of
string
and
that
as
a
result
every
child
in
the
village
assiduously
collected
balls
of
twine
a
bright
chicago
boy
might
well
draw
the
inference
that
the
path
of
the
corrupt
politician
not
only
leads
to
civic
honors
but
to
the
glories
of
benevolence
and
philanthropy
this
lowering
of
standards
this
setting
of
an
ideal
is
perhaps
the
worst
of
the
situation
for
as
we
said
in
the
first
chapter
we
determine
ideals
by
our
daily
actions
and
decisions
not
only
for
ourselves
but
largely
for
each
other
we
are
all
involved
in
this
political
corruption
and
as
members
of
the
community
stand
indicted
this
is
the
penalty
of
a
democracy
that
we
are
bound
to
move
forward
or
retrograde
together
none
of
us
can
stand
aside
our
feet
are
mired
in
the
same
soil
and
our
lungs
breathe
the
same
air
that
the
alderman
has
much
to
do
with
setting
the
standard
of
life
and
desirable
prosperity
may
be
illustrated
by
the
following
incident
during
one
of
the
campaigns
a
clever
cartoonist
drew
a
poster
representing
the
successful
alderman
in
portraiture
drinking
champagne
at
a
table
loaded
with
pretentious
dishes
and
surrounded
by
other
revellers
in
contradistinction
was
his
opponent
a
bricklayer
who
sat
upon
a
wall
eating
a
meagre
dinner
from
a
and
the
was
asked
which
type
of
representative
he
preferred
the
presumption
being
that
at
least
in
a
district
the
bricklayer
would
come
out
ahead
to
the
chagrin
of
the
reformers
however
it
was
gradually
discovered
that
in
the
popular
mind
a
man
who
laid
bricks
and
wore
overalls
was
not
nearly
so
desirable
for
an
alderman
as
the
man
who
drank
champagne
and
wore
a
diamond
in
his
shirt
front
the
district
wished
its
representative
to
stand
up
with
the
best
of
them
and
certainly
some
of
the
constituents
would
have
been
ashamed
to
have
been
represented
by
a
bricklayer
it
is
part
of
that
general
desire
to
appear
well
the
optimistic
and
thoroughly
american
belief
that
even
if
a
man
is
working
with
his
hands
he
and
his
children
will
quite
likely
be
in
a
better
position
in
the
swift
coming
and
there
is
no
need
of
being
too
closely
associated
with
common
working
people
there
is
an
honest
absence
of
class
consciousness
and
a
naïve
belief
that
the
kind
of
occupation
quite
largely
determines
social
position
this
is
doubtless
exaggerated
in
a
neighborhood
of
foreign
people
by
the
fact
that
as
each
nationality
becomes
more
adapted
to
american
conditions
the
scale
of
its
occupation
rises
fifty
years
ago
in
america
a
dutchman
was
used
as
a
term
of
reproach
meaning
a
man
whose
language
was
not
understood
and
who
performed
menial
tasks
digging
sewers
and
building
railroad
embankments
later
the
irish
did
the
same
work
in
the
community
but
as
quickly
as
possible
handed
it
on
to
the
italians
to
whom
the
name
dago
is
said
to
cling
as
a
result
of
the
digging
which
the
irishman
resigned
to
him
the
italian
himself
is
at
last
waking
up
to
this
fact
in
a
political
speech
recently
made
by
an
italian
padrone
he
bitterly
reproached
the
alderman
for
giving
jobs
of
sitting
in
an
office
to
irishmen
and
jobs
of
sweeping
the
streets
to
the
italians
this
general
struggle
to
rise
in
life
to
be
at
least
politically
represented
by
one
of
the
best
as
to
occupation
and
social
status
has
also
its
negative
side
we
must
remember
that
the
imitative
impulse
plays
an
important
part
in
life
and
that
the
loss
of
social
estimation
keenly
felt
by
all
of
us
is
perhaps
most
dreaded
by
the
humblest
among
whom
freedom
of
individual
conduct
the
power
to
give
only
just
weight
to
the
opinion
of
neighbors
is
but
feebly
developed
a
form
of
constraint
gentle
but
powerful
is
afforded
by
the
simple
desire
to
do
what
others
do
in
order
to
share
with
them
the
approval
of
the
community
of
course
the
larger
the
number
of
people
among
whom
an
habitual
mode
of
conduct
obtains
the
greater
the
constraint
it
puts
upon
the
individual
will
thus
it
is
that
the
political
corruption
of
the
city
presses
most
heavily
where
it
can
be
least
resisted
and
is
most
likely
to
be
imitated
according
to
the
same
law
the
positive
evils
of
corrupt
government
are
bound
to
fall
heaviest
upon
the
poorest
and
least
capable
when
the
water
of
chicago
is
foul
the
prosperous
buy
water
bottled
at
distant
springs
the
poor
have
no
alternative
but
the
typhoid
fever
which
comes
from
using
the
city
supply
when
the
garbage
contracts
are
not
enforced
the
pay
for
private
service
the
poor
suffer
the
discomfort
and
illness
which
are
inevitable
from
a
foul
atmosphere
the
prosperous
business
man
has
a
certain
choice
as
to
whether
he
will
treat
with
the
boss
politician
or
preserve
his
independence
on
a
smaller
income
but
to
an
italian
day
laborer
it
is
a
choice
between
obeying
the
commands
of
a
political
boss
or
practical
starvation
again
a
more
intelligent
man
may
philosophize
a
little
upon
the
present
state
of
corruption
and
reflect
that
it
is
but
a
phase
of
our
commercialism
from
which
we
are
bound
to
emerge
at
any
rate
he
may
give
himself
the
solace
of
literature
and
ideals
in
other
directions
but
the
more
ignorant
man
who
lives
only
in
the
narrow
present
has
no
such
resource
slowly
the
conviction
enters
his
mind
that
politics
is
a
matter
of
favors
and
positions
that
means
pleasing
the
boss
and
standing
in
with
the
gang
this
slowly
acquired
knowledge
he
hands
on
to
his
family
during
the
month
of
february
his
boy
may
come
home
from
school
with
rather
incoherent
tales
about
washington
and
lincoln
and
the
father
may
for
the
moment
be
fired
to
tell
of
garibaldi
but
such
talk
is
only
periodic
and
the
long
year
round
the
fortunes
of
the
entire
family
down
to
the
opportunity
to
earn
food
and
shelter
depend
upon
the
boss
in
a
certain
measure
also
the
opportunities
for
pleasure
and
recreation
depend
upon
him
to
use
a
former
illustration
if
a
man
happens
to
have
a
taste
for
gambling
if
the
slot
machine
affords
him
diversion
he
goes
to
those
houses
which
are
protected
by
political
influence
if
he
and
his
friends
like
to
drop
into
a
saloon
after
midnight
or
even
want
to
hear
a
little
music
while
they
drink
together
early
in
the
evening
he
is
breaking
the
law
when
he
indulges
in
either
of
them
and
can
only
be
exempt
from
arrest
or
fine
because
the
great
political
machine
is
friendly
to
him
and
expects
his
allegiance
in
return
during
the
campaign
when
it
was
found
hard
to
secure
enough
local
speakers
of
the
moral
tone
which
was
desired
orators
were
imported
from
other
parts
of
the
town
from
the
better
element
suddenly
it
was
rumored
on
all
sides
that
while
the
money
and
speakers
for
the
reform
candidate
were
coming
from
the
swells
the
money
which
was
backing
the
corrupt
alderman
also
came
from
a
swell
source
that
the
president
of
a
combination
for
whom
he
performed
constant
offices
in
the
city
council
was
ready
to
back
him
to
the
extent
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
that
this
president
too
was
a
good
man
and
sat
in
high
places
that
he
had
recently
given
a
large
sum
of
money
to
an
educational
institution
and
was
therefore
as
philanthropic
not
to
say
good
and
upright
as
any
man
in
town
that
the
corrupt
alderman
had
the
sanction
of
the
highest
authorities
and
that
the
lecturers
who
were
talking
against
corruption
and
the
selling
and
buying
of
franchises
were
only
the
cranks
and
not
the
solid
business
men
who
had
developed
and
built
up
chicago
all
parts
of
the
community
are
bound
together
in
ethical
development
if
the
more
enlightened
members
accept
corporate
gifts
from
the
man
who
buys
up
the
council
and
the
less
enlightened
members
accept
individual
gifts
from
the
man
who
sells
out
the
council
we
surely
must
take
our
punishment
together
there
is
the
difference
of
course
that
in
the
first
case
we
act
collectively
and
in
the
second
case
individually
but
is
the
punishment
which
follows
the
first
any
lighter
or
less
in
its
consequences
than
the
more
obvious
one
which
follows
the
second
have
our
morals
been
so
captured
by
commercialism
to
use
generalization
that
we
do
not
see
a
moral
dereliction
when
business
or
educational
interests
are
served
thereby
although
we
are
still
shocked
when
the
saloon
interest
is
thus
served
the
company
which
declares
that
it
is
impossible
to
do
business
without
managing
the
city
council
is
on
exactly
the
same
moral
level
with
the
man
who
can
not
retain
political
power
unless
he
has
a
saloon
a
large
acquaintance
with
the
class
and
questionable
money
with
which
to
debauch
his
constituents
both
sets
of
men
assume
that
the
only
appeal
possible
is
along
the
line
of
they
frankly
acknowledge
money
getting
as
their
own
motive
power
and
they
believe
in
the
cupidity
of
all
the
men
whom
they
encounter
no
attempt
in
either
case
is
made
to
put
forward
the
claims
of
the
public
or
to
find
a
moral
basis
for
action
as
the
corrupt
politician
assumes
that
public
morality
is
impossible
so
many
business
men
become
convinced
that
to
pay
tribute
to
the
corrupt
aldermen
is
on
the
whole
cheaper
than
to
have
taxes
too
high
that
it
is
better
to
pay
exorbitant
rates
for
franchises
than
to
be
made
unwilling
partners
in
transportation
experiments
such
men
come
to
regard
political
reformers
as
a
sort
of
monomaniac
who
are
not
reasonable
enough
to
see
the
necessity
of
the
present
arrangement
which
has
slowly
been
evolved
and
developed
and
upon
which
business
is
safely
conducted
a
reformer
who
really
knew
the
people
and
their
great
human
needs
who
believed
that
it
was
the
business
of
government
to
serve
them
and
who
further
recognized
the
educative
power
of
a
sense
of
responsibility
would
possess
a
clew
by
which
he
might
analyze
the
situation
he
would
find
out
what
needs
which
the
alderman
supplies
are
legitimate
ones
which
the
city
itself
could
undertake
in
to
those
which
pander
to
the
lower
instincts
of
the
constituency
a
mother
who
eats
her
christmas
turkey
in
a
reverent
spirit
of
thankfulness
to
the
alderman
who
gave
it
to
her
might
be
gradually
brought
to
a
genuine
sense
of
appreciation
and
gratitude
to
the
city
which
supplies
her
little
children
with
a
kindergarten
or
to
the
board
of
health
which
properly
placarded
a
case
of
next
door
and
spared
her
sleepless
nights
and
wearing
anxiety
as
well
as
the
money
paid
with
such
difficulty
to
the
doctor
and
the
druggist
the
man
who
in
his
emotional
gratitude
almost
kneels
before
his
political
friend
who
gets
his
boy
out
of
jail
might
be
made
to
see
the
kindness
and
good
sense
of
the
city
authorities
who
provided
the
boy
with
a
playground
and
reading
room
where
he
might
spend
his
hours
of
idleness
and
restlessness
and
through
which
his
temptations
to
petty
crime
might
be
averted
a
man
who
is
grateful
to
the
alderman
who
sees
that
his
gambling
and
racing
are
not
interfered
with
might
learn
to
feel
loyal
and
responsible
to
the
city
which
supplied
him
with
a
gymnasium
and
swimming
tank
where
manly
and
sports
are
possible
the
voter
who
is
eager
to
serve
the
alderman
at
all
times
because
the
tenure
of
his
job
is
dependent
upon
aldermanic
favor
might
find
great
relief
and
pleasure
in
working
for
the
city
in
which
his
place
was
secured
by
a
civil
service
law
after
all
what
the
corrupt
alderman
demands
from
his
followers
and
largely
depends
upon
is
a
sense
of
loyalty
a
the
man
who
is
good
to
you
who
understands
you
and
who
gets
you
out
of
trouble
all
the
social
life
of
the
voter
from
the
time
he
was
a
little
boy
and
played
craps
with
his
own
push
and
not
with
some
other
push
has
been
founded
on
this
sense
of
loyalty
and
of
standing
in
with
his
friends
now
that
he
is
a
man
he
likes
the
sense
of
being
inside
a
political
organization
of
being
trusted
with
political
gossip
of
belonging
to
a
set
of
fellows
who
understand
things
and
whose
interests
are
being
cared
for
by
a
strong
friend
in
the
city
council
itself
all
this
is
perfectly
legitimate
and
all
in
the
line
of
the
development
of
a
strong
civic
loyalty
if
it
were
merely
socialized
and
enlarged
such
a
voter
has
already
proceeded
in
the
forward
direction
in
so
far
as
he
has
lost
the
sense
of
isolation
and
has
abandoned
the
conviction
that
city
government
does
not
touch
his
individual
affairs
even
mill
claims
that
the
social
feelings
of
man
his
desire
to
be
at
unity
with
his
are
the
natural
basis
for
morality
and
he
defines
a
man
of
high
moral
culture
as
one
who
thinks
of
himself
not
as
an
isolated
individual
but
as
a
part
in
a
social
organism
upon
this
foundation
it
ought
not
to
be
difficult
to
build
a
structure
of
civic
virtue
it
is
only
necessary
to
make
it
clear
to
the
voter
that
his
individual
needs
are
common
needs
that
is
public
needs
and
that
they
can
only
be
legitimately
supplied
for
him
when
they
are
supplied
for
all
if
we
believe
that
the
individual
struggle
for
life
may
widen
into
a
struggle
for
the
lives
of
all
surely
the
demand
of
an
individual
for
decency
and
comfort
for
a
chance
to
work
and
obtain
the
fulness
of
life
may
be
widened
until
it
gradually
embraces
all
the
members
of
the
community
and
rises
into
a
sense
of
the
common
weal
in
order
however
to
give
him
a
sense
of
conviction
that
his
individual
needs
must
be
merged
into
the
needs
of
the
many
and
are
only
important
as
they
are
thus
merged
the
appeal
can
not
be
made
along
the
line
of
the
demand
should
be
universalized
in
this
process
it
would
also
become
clarified
and
the
basis
of
our
political
organization
become
perforce
social
and
ethical
would
it
be
dangerous
to
conclude
that
the
corrupt
politician
himself
because
he
is
democratic
in
method
is
on
a
more
ethical
line
of
social
development
than
the
reformer
who
believes
that
the
people
must
be
made
over
by
good
citizens
and
governed
by
experts
the
former
at
least
are
engaged
in
that
great
moral
effort
of
getting
the
mass
to
express
itself
and
of
adding
this
mass
energy
and
wisdom
to
the
community
as
a
whole
the
wide
divergence
of
experience
makes
it
difficult
for
the
good
citizen
to
understand
this
point
of
view
and
many
things
conspire
to
make
it
hard
for
him
to
act
upon
it
he
is
more
or
less
a
victim
to
that
curious
feeling
so
often
possessed
by
the
good
man
that
the
righteous
do
not
need
to
be
agreeable
that
their
goodness
alone
is
sufficient
and
that
they
can
leave
the
arts
and
wiles
of
securing
popular
favor
to
the
this
results
in
a
certain
repellent
manner
commonly
regarded
as
the
apparel
of
righteousness
and
is
further
responsible
for
the
fatal
mistake
of
making
the
surroundings
of
good
influences
singularly
unattractive
a
mistake
which
really
deserves
a
reprimand
quite
as
severe
as
the
equally
reprehensible
deed
of
making
the
surroundings
of
evil
influences
so
beguiling
both
are
akin
to
that
state
of
mind
which
narrows
the
entrance
into
a
wider
morality
to
the
eye
of
a
needle
and
accounts
for
the
fact
that
new
moral
movements
have
ever
and
again
been
inaugurated
by
those
who
have
found
themselves
in
revolt
against
the
conventionalized
good
the
success
of
the
reforming
politician
who
insists
upon
mere
purity
of
administration
and
upon
the
control
and
suppression
of
the
unruly
elements
in
the
community
may
be
the
easy
result
of
a
narrowing
and
selfish
process
for
the
painful
condition
of
endeavoring
to
minister
to
genuine
social
needs
through
the
political
machinery
and
at
the
same
time
to
remodel
that
machinery
so
that
it
shall
be
adequate
to
its
new
task
is
to
encounter
the
inevitable
discomfort
of
a
transition
into
a
new
type
of
democratic
relation
the
perplexing
experiences
of
the
actual
administration
however
have
a
genuine
value
of
their
own
the
economist
who
treats
the
individual
cases
as
mere
data
and
the
social
reformer
who
labors
to
make
such
cases
impossible
solely
because
of
the
appeal
to
his
reason
may
have
to
share
these
perplexities
before
they
feel
themselves
within
the
grasp
of
a
principle
of
growth
working
outward
from
within
before
they
can
gain
the
exhilaration
and
uplift
which
comes
when
the
individual
sympathy
and
intelligence
is
caught
into
the
forward
intuitive
movement
of
the
mass
this
general
movement
is
not
without
its
intellectual
aspects
but
it
has
to
be
transferred
from
the
region
of
perception
to
that
of
emotion
before
it
is
really
apprehended
the
mass
of
men
seldom
move
together
without
an
emotional
incentive
the
man
who
chooses
to
stand
aside
avoids
much
of
the
perplexity
but
at
the
same
time
he
loses
contact
with
a
great
source
of
vitality
perhaps
the
last
and
greatest
difficulty
in
the
paths
of
those
who
are
attempting
to
define
and
attain
a
social
morality
is
that
which
arises
from
the
fact
that
they
can
not
adequately
test
the
value
of
their
efforts
can
not
indeed
be
sure
of
their
motives
until
their
efforts
are
reduced
to
action
and
are
presented
in
some
workable
form
of
social
conduct
or
control
for
action
is
indeed
the
sole
medium
of
expression
for
ethics
we
continually
forget
that
the
sphere
of
morals
is
the
sphere
of
action
that
speculation
in
regard
to
morality
is
but
observation
and
must
remain
in
the
sphere
of
intellectual
comment
that
a
situation
does
not
really
become
moral
until
we
are
confronted
with
the
question
of
what
shall
be
done
in
a
concrete
case
and
are
obliged
to
act
upon
our
theory
a
stirring
appeal
has
lately
been
made
by
a
recognized
ethical
lecturer
who
has
declared
that
it
is
insanity
to
expect
to
receive
the
data
of
wisdom
by
looking
on
we
arrive
at
moral
knowledge
only
by
tentative
and
observant
practice
we
learn
how
to
apply
the
new
insight
by
having
attempted
to
apply
the
old
and
having
found
it
to
fail
this
necessity
of
reducing
the
experiment
to
action
throws
out
of
the
undertaking
all
timid
and
irresolute
persons
more
than
that
all
those
who
shrink
before
the
need
of
striving
forward
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
cruder
men
whose
sole
virtue
may
be
social
effort
and
even
that
not
untainted
by
who
are
indeed
pushing
forward
social
morality
but
who
are
doing
it
irrationally
and
emotionally
and
often
at
the
expense
of
the
standards
of
morality
the
power
to
distinguish
between
the
genuine
effort
and
the
adventitious
mistakes
is
perhaps
the
most
difficult
test
which
comes
to
our
fallible
intelligence
in
the
range
of
individual
morals
we
have
learned
to
distrust
him
who
would
reach
spirituality
by
simply
renouncing
the
world
or
by
merely
speculating
upon
its
evils
the
result
as
well
as
the
process
of
virtues
attained
by
repression
has
become
distasteful
to
us
when
the
entire
moral
energy
of
an
individual
goes
into
the
cultivation
of
personal
integrity
we
all
know
how
unlovely
the
result
may
become
the
character
is
upright
of
course
but
too
coated
over
with
the
result
of
its
own
endeavor
to
be
attractive
in
this
effort
toward
a
higher
morality
in
our
social
relations
we
must
demand
that
the
individual
shall
be
willing
to
lose
the
sense
of
personal
achievement
and
shall
be
content
to
realize
his
activity
only
in
connection
with
the
activity
of
the
many
the
cry
of
back
to
the
people
is
always
heard
at
the
same
time
when
we
have
the
prophet
demand
for
repentance
or
the
religious
cry
of
back
to
christ
as
though
we
would
seek
refuge
with
our
fellows
and
believe
in
our
common
experiences
as
a
preparation
for
a
new
moral
struggle
as
the
acceptance
of
democracy
brings
a
certain
power
so
it
has
its
own
sanctions
and
comforts
perhaps
the
most
obvious
one
is
the
curious
sense
which
comes
to
us
from
time
to
time
that
we
belong
to
the
whole
that
a
certain
basic
well
being
can
never
be
taken
away
from
us
whatever
the
turn
of
fortune
tolstoy
has
portrayed
the
experience
in
master
and
man
the
former
saves
his
servant
from
freezing
by
protecting
him
with
the
heat
of
his
body
and
his
dying
hours
are
filled
with
an
ineffable
sense
of
healing
and
such
experiences
of
which
we
have
all
had
glimpses
anticipate
in
our
relation
to
the
living
that
peace
of
mind
which
envelopes
us
when
we
meditate
upon
the
great
multitude
of
the
dead
it
is
akin
to
the
assurance
that
the
dead
understand
because
they
have
entered
into
the
great
experience
and
therefore
must
comprehend
all
lesser
ones
that
all
the
misunderstandings
we
have
in
life
are
due
to
partial
experience
and
all
life
fretting
comes
of
our
limited
intelligence
when
the
last
and
great
experience
comes
it
is
perforce
attended

mercy
and
forgiveness
