ebony
to
be
rich
is
a
luxurious
sensation
the
more
so
when
you
have
plumbed
the
depths
of
as
a
fleet
street
hack
a
of
unconsidered
pars
a
reporter
an
unappreciated
journalist
all
callings
utterly
inconsistent
with
one
family
feeling
and
one
direct
descent
from
the
dukes
of
picardy
when
my
aunt
dorcas
died
and
left
me
seven
hundred
a
year
and
a
furnished
house
in
chelsea
i
felt
that
life
had
nothing
left
to
offer
except
immediate
possession
of
the
legacy
even
mildred
mayhew
whom
i
had
hitherto
regarded
as
my
life
light
became
less
luminous
i
was
not
engaged
to
mildred
but
i
lodged
with
her
mother
and
i
sang
duets
with
mildred
and
gave
her
gloves
when
it
would
run
to
it
which
was
seldom
she
was
a
dear
good
girl
and
i
meant
to
marry
her
some
day
it
is
very
nice
to
feel
that
a
good
little
woman
is
thinking
of
you
it
helps
you
in
your
work
and
it
is
pleasant
to
know
she
will
say
yes
when
you
say
will
you
but
as
i
say
my
legacy
almost
put
mildred
out
of
my
head
especially
as
she
was
staying
with
friends
in
the
country
just
then
before
the
first
gloss
was
off
my
new
mourning
i
was
seated
in
my
own
armchair
in
front
of
the
fire
in
the
of
my
own
house
my
own
house
it
was
grand
but
rather
lonely
i
think
of
mildred
just
then
the
room
was
comfortably
furnished
with
oak
and
leather
on
the
walls
hung
a
few
fairly
good
but
the
space
above
the
mantelpiece
was
disfigured
by
an
exceedingly
bad
print
the
trial
of
lord
william
russell
framed
in
a
dark
frame
i
got
up
to
look
at
it
i
had
visited
my
aunt
with
dutiful
regularity
but
i
never
remembered
seeing
this
frame
before
it
was
not
intended
for
a
print
but
for
an
it
was
of
fine
ebony
beautifully
and
curiously
carved
i
looked
at
it
with
growing
interest
and
when
my
aunt
housemaid
i
had
retained
her
modest
staff
of
servants
came
in
with
the
lamp
i
asked
her
how
long
the
print
had
been
there
mistress
only
bought
it
two
days
afore
she
was
took
ill
she
said
but
the
frame
she
did
want
to
buy
a
new
one
so
she
got
this
out
of
the
attic
there
lots
of
curious
old
things
there
sir
had
my
aunt
had
this
frame
long
oh
yes
sir
it
come
long
afore
i
did
and
i
been
here
seven
years
come
christmas
there
was
a
picture
in
it
that
upstairs
too
but
that
black
and
ugly
it
might
as
well
be
a
i
felt
a
desire
to
see
this
picture
what
if
it
were
some
priceless
old
master
in
which
my
aunt
eyes
had
only
seen
rubbish
directly
after
breakfast
next
morning
i
paid
a
visit
to
the
it
was
crammed
with
old
furniture
enough
to
stock
a
curiosity
shop
all
the
house
was
furnished
solidly
in
the
early
victorian
style
and
in
this
room
everything
not
in
keeping
with
the
suite
ideal
was
stowed
away
tables
of
and
chairs
with
twisted
feet
and
faded
needlework
cushions
firescreens
of
design
oak
bureaux
with
brass
handles
a
little
with
its
faded
silk
flutings
hanging
in
disconsolate
shreds
on
these
and
the
dust
that
covered
them
blazed
the
full
daylight
as
i
drew
up
the
blinds
i
promised
myself
a
good
time
in
these
household
gods
in
my
parlour
and
promoting
the
victorian
suite
to
the
attic
but
at
present
my
business
was
to
find
the
picture
as
black
as
the
and
presently
behind
a
heap
of
hideous
studies
i
found
it
jane
the
housemaid
identified
it
at
once
i
took
it
downstairs
carefully
and
examined
it
no
subject
no
colour
were
distinguishable
there
was
a
splodge
of
a
darker
tint
in
the
middle
but
whether
it
was
figure
or
tree
or
house
no
man
could
have
told
it
seemed
to
be
painted
on
a
very
thick
panel
bound
with
leather
i
decided
to
send
it
to
one
of
those
persons
who
pour
on
rotting
family
portraits
the
water
of
eternal
youth
mere
soap
and
water
besant
tells
us
it
is
but
even
as
i
did
so
the
thought
occurred
to
me
to
try
my
own
restorative
hand
at
a
corner
of
it
my
soap
and
nailbrush
vigorously
applied
for
a
few
seconds
showed
me
that
there
was
no
picture
to
clean
bare
oak
presented
itself
to
my
persevering
brush
i
tried
the
other
side
jane
watching
me
with
indulgent
interest
the
same
result
then
the
truth
dawned
on
me
why
was
the
panel
so
thick
i
tore
off
the
leather
binding
and
the
panel
divided
and
fell
to
the
ground
in
a
cloud
of
dust
there
were
two
pictures
they
had
been
nailed
face
to
face
i
leaned
them
against
the
wall
and
the
next
moment
i
was
leaning
against
it
myself
for
one
of
the
pictures
was
myself
a
perfect
portrait
no
shade
of
expression
or
turn
of
feature
wanting
myself
in
a
cavalier
dress
and
all
when
had
this
been
done
and
how
without
my
knowledge
was
this
some
whim
of
my
aunt
lor
sir
the
shrill
surprise
of
jane
at
my
elbow
what
a
lovely
photo
it
is
was
it
a
fancy
ball
sir
yes
i
stammered
i
i
do
think
i
want
anything
more
now
you
can
go
she
went
and
i
turned
still
with
my
heart
beating
violently
to
the
other
picture
this
was
a
woman
of
the
type
of
beauty
beloved
of
burne
jones
and
rossetti
straight
nose
low
brows
full
lips
thin
hands
large
deep
luminous
eyes
she
wore
a
black
velvet
gown
it
was
a
portrait
her
arms
rested
on
a
table
beside
her
and
her
head
on
her
hands
but
her
face
was
turned
full
forward
and
her
eyes
met
those
of
the
spectator
bewilderingly
on
the
table
by
her
were
compasses
and
instruments
whose
uses
i
did
not
know
books
a
goblet
and
a
miscellaneous
heap
of
papers
and
pens
i
saw
all
this
afterwards
i
believe
it
was
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
i
could
turn
my
eyes
away
from
hers
i
have
never
seen
any
other
eyes
like
hers
they
appealed
as
a
child
or
a
dog
do
they
commanded
as
might
those
of
an
empress
shall
i
sweep
up
the
dust
sir
curiosity
had
brought
jane
back
i
acceded
i
turned
from
her
my
portrait
i
kept
between
her
and
the
woman
in
the
black
velvet
when
i
was
alone
again
i
tore
down
the
trial
of
lord
william
russell
and
i
put
the
picture
of
the
woman
in
its
strong
ebony
frame
then
i
wrote
to
a
for
a
frame
for
my
portrait
it
had
so
long
lived
face
to
face
with
this
beautiful
witch
that
i
had
not
the
heart
to
banish
it
from
her
presence
from
which
it
will
be
perceived
that
i
am
by
nature
a
somewhat
sentimental
person
the
new
frame
came
home
and
i
hung
it
opposite
the
fireplace
an
exhaustive
search
among
my
aunt
papers
showed
no
explanation
of
the
portrait
of
myself
no
history
of
the
portrait
of
the
woman
with
the
wonderful
eyes
i
only
learned
that
all
the
old
furniture
together
had
come
to
my
aunt
at
the
death
of
my
the
head
of
the
family
and
i
should
have
concluded
that
the
resemblance
was
only
a
family
one
if
every
one
who
came
in
had
not
exclaimed
at
the
speaking
likeness
i
adopted
jane
fancy
ball
explanation
and
there
one
might
suppose
the
matter
of
the
portraits
ended
one
might
suppose
it
that
is
if
there
were
not
evidently
a
good
deal
more
written
here
about
it
however
to
me
then
the
matter
seemed
ended
i
went
to
see
mildred
i
invited
her
and
her
mother
to
come
and
stay
with
me
i
rather
avoided
glancing
at
the
picture
in
the
ebony
frame
i
could
not
forget
nor
remember
without
singular
emotion
the
look
in
the
eyes
of
that
woman
when
mine
first
met
them
i
shrank
from
meeting
that
look
again
i
reorganized
the
house
somewhat
preparing
for
mildred
visit
i
turned
the
into
a
i
brought
down
much
of
the
furniture
and
after
a
long
day
of
arranging
and
i
sat
down
before
the
fire
and
lying
back
in
a
pleasant
languor
i
idly
raised
my
eyes
to
the
picture
i
met
her
dark
deep
hazel
eyes
and
once
more
my
gaze
was
held
fixed
as
by
a
strong
magic
the
kind
of
fascination
that
keeps
one
sometimes
staring
for
whole
minutes
into
one
own
eyes
in
the
glass
i
gazed
into
her
eyes
and
felt
my
own
dilate
pricked
with
a
smart
like
the
smart
of
tears
i
wish
i
said
oh
how
i
wish
you
were
a
woman
and
not
a
picture
come
down
ah
come
down
i
laughed
at
myself
as
i
spoke
but
even
as
i
laughed
i
held
out
my
arms
i
was
not
sleepy
i
was
not
drunk
i
was
as
wide
awake
and
as
sober
as
ever
was
a
man
in
this
world
and
yet
as
i
held
out
my
arms
i
saw
the
eyes
of
the
picture
dilate
her
lips
tremble
if
i
were
to
be
hanged
for
saying
it
it
is
true
her
hands
moved
slightly
and
a
sort
of
flicker
of
a
smile
passed
over
her
face
i
sprang
to
my
feet
this
wo
do
i
said
still
aloud
firelight
does
play
strange
tricks
i
have
the
lamp
i
pulled
myself
together
and
made
for
the
bell
my
hand
was
on
it
when
i
heard
a
sound
behind
me
and
turned
the
bell
still
unrung
the
fire
had
burned
low
and
the
corners
of
the
room
were
deeply
shadowed
but
surely
there
behind
the
tall
worked
chair
was
something
darker
than
a
shadow
i
must
face
this
out
i
said
or
i
shall
never
be
able
to
face
myself
again
i
left
the
bell
i
seized
the
poker
and
battered
the
dull
coals
to
a
blaze
then
i
stepped
back
resolutely
and
looked
up
at
the
picture
the
ebony
frame
was
empty
from
the
shadow
of
the
worked
chair
came
a
silken
rustle
and
out
of
the
shadow
the
woman
of
the
picture
was
coming
coming
towards
me
i
hope
i
shall
never
again
know
a
moment
of
terror
so
blank
and
absolute
i
could
not
have
moved
or
spoken
to
save
my
life
either
all
the
known
laws
of
nature
were
nothing
or
i
was
mad
i
stood
trembling
but
i
am
thankful
to
remember
i
stood
still
while
the
black
velvet
gown
swept
across
the
hearthrug
towards
me
next
moment
a
hand
touched
me
a
hand
soft
warm
and
human
and
a
low
voice
said
you
called
me
i
am
here
at
that
touch
and
that
voice
the
world
seemed
to
give
a
sort
of
bewildering
i
hardly
know
how
to
express
it
but
at
once
it
seemed
not
awful
not
even
unusual
for
portraits
to
become
flesh
only
most
natural
most
right
most
unspeakably
fortunate
i
laid
my
hand
on
hers
i
looked
from
her
to
my
portrait
i
could
not
see
it
in
the
firelight
we
are
not
strangers
i
said
oh
no
not
strangers
those
luminous
eyes
were
looking
up
into
mine
those
red
lips
were
near
me
with
a
passionate
cry
a
sense
of
having
suddenly
recovered
life
one
great
good
that
had
seemed
wholly
lost
i
clasped
her
in
my
arms
she
was
no
ghost
she
was
a
woman
the
only
woman
in
the
world
how
long
i
said
o
love
how
long
since
i
lost
you
she
leaned
back
hanging
her
full
weight
on
the
hands
that
were
clasped
behind
my
head
how
can
i
tell
how
long
there
is
no
time
in
hell
she
answered
it
was
not
a
dream
ah
no
there
are
no
such
dreams
i
wish
to
god
there
could
be
when
in
dreams
do
i
see
her
eyes
hear
her
voice
feel
her
lips
against
my
cheek
hold
her
hands
to
my
lips
as
i
did
that
night
the
supreme
night
of
my
life
at
first
we
hardly
spoke
it
seemed
enough
after
long
grief
and
pain
to
feel
the
arms
of
my
true
love
round
me
once
again
it
is
very
difficult
to
tell
this
story
there
are
no
words
to
express
the
sense
of
glad
reunion
the
complete
realization
of
every
hope
and
dream
of
a
life
that
came
upon
me
as
i
sat
with
my
hand
in
hers
and
looked
into
her
eyes
how
could
it
have
been
a
dream
when
i
left
her
sitting
in
the
chair
and
went
down
to
the
kitchen
to
tell
the
maids
i
should
want
nothing
more
that
i
was
busy
and
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
when
i
fetched
wood
for
the
fire
with
my
own
hands
and
bringing
it
in
found
her
still
sitting
there
saw
the
little
brown
head
turn
as
i
entered
saw
the
love
in
her
dear
eyes
when
i
threw
myself
at
her
feet
and
blessed
the
day
i
was
born
since
life
had
given
me
this
not
a
thought
of
mildred
all
the
other
things
in
my
life
were
a
dream
this
its
one
splendid
reality
i
am
wondering
she
said
after
a
while
when
we
had
made
such
cheer
each
of
the
other
as
true
lovers
may
after
long
parting
i
am
wondering
how
much
you
remember
of
our
past
i
remember
nothing
i
said
oh
my
dear
lady
my
dear
sweetheart
i
remember
nothing
but
that
i
love
you
that
i
have
loved
you
all
my
life
you
remember
nothing
really
nothing
only
that
i
am
yours
that
we
have
both
suffered
that
tell
me
my
mistress
dear
all
that
you
remember
explain
it
all
to
me
make
me
understand
and
yet
no
i
do
want
to
understand
it
is
enough
that
we
are
together
if
it
was
a
dream
why
have
i
never
dreamed
it
again
she
leaned
down
towards
me
her
arm
lay
on
my
neck
and
drew
my
head
till
it
rested
on
her
shoulder
i
am
a
ghost
i
suppose
she
said
laughing
softly
and
her
laughter
stirred
memories
which
i
just
grasped
at
and
just
missed
but
you
and
i
know
better
do
we
i
will
tell
you
everything
you
have
forgotten
we
loved
each
other
ah
no
you
have
not
forgotten
that
and
when
you
came
back
from
the
war
we
were
to
be
married
our
pictures
were
painted
before
you
went
away
you
know
i
was
more
learned
than
women
of
that
day
dear
one
when
you
were
gone
they
said
i
was
a
witch
they
tried
me
they
said
i
should
be
burned
just
because
i
had
looked
at
the
stars
and
had
gained
more
knowledge
than
they
they
must
needs
bind
me
to
a
stake
and
let
me
be
eaten
by
the
fire
and
you
far
away
her
whole
body
trembled
and
shrank
o
love
what
dream
would
have
told
me
that
my
kisses
would
soothe
even
that
memory
the
night
before
she
went
on
the
devil
did
come
to
me
i
was
innocent
before
you
know
it
do
you
and
even
then
my
sin
was
for
you
for
you
because
of
the
exceeding
love
i
bore
you
the
devil
came
and
i
sold
my
soul
to
eternal
flame
but
i
got
a
good
price
i
got
the
right
to
come
back
through
my
picture
if
any
one
looking
at
it
wished
for
me
as
long
as
my
picture
stayed
in
its
ebony
frame
that
frame
was
not
carved
by
man
hand
i
got
the
right
to
come
back
to
you
oh
my
heart
heart
and
another
thing
i
won
which
you
shall
hear
anon
they
burned
me
for
a
witch
they
made
me
suffer
hell
on
earth
those
faces
all
crowding
round
the
crackling
wood
and
the
smell
of
the
smoke
o
love
no
more
no
more
when
my
mother
sat
that
night
before
my
picture
she
wept
and
cried
back
my
poor
lost
child
and
i
went
to
her
with
glad
leaps
of
heart
dear
she
shrank
from
me
she
fled
she
shrieked
and
moaned
of
ghosts
she
had
our
pictures
covered
from
sight
and
put
again
in
the
ebony
frame
she
had
promised
me
my
picture
should
stay
always
there
ah
through
all
these
years
your
face
was
against
mine
she
paused
but
the
man
you
loved
you
came
home
my
picture
was
gone
they
lied
to
you
and
you
married
another
woman
but
some
day
i
knew
you
would
walk
the
world
again
and
that
i
should
find
you
the
other
gain
i
asked
the
other
gain
she
said
slowly
i
gave
my
soul
for
it
is
this
if
you
also
will
give
up
your
hopes
of
heaven
i
can
remain
a
woman
i
can
move
in
your
world
i
can
be
your
wife
oh
my
dear
after
all
these
years
at
last
at
last
if
i
sacrifice
my
soul
i
said
slowly
with
no
thought
of
the
imbecility
of
such
talk
in
our
nineteenth
century
if
i
sacrifice
my
soul
i
win
you
why
love
it
a
contradiction
in
terms
you
my
soul
her
eyes
looked
straight
into
mine
whatever
might
happen
whatever
did
happen
whatever
may
happen
our
two
souls
in
that
moment
met
and
became
one
then
you
choose
you
deliberately
choose
to
give
up
your
hopes
of
heaven
for
me
as
i
gave
up
mine
for
you
i
decline
i
said
to
give
up
my
hope
of
heaven
on
any
terms
tell
me
what
i
must
do
that
you
and
i
may
make
our
heaven
here
as
now
my
dear
love
i
will
tell
you
she
said
be
alone
here
night
twelve
is
ghost
time
is
it
and
then
i
will
come
out
of
the
picture
and
never
go
back
to
it
i
shall
live
with
you
and
die
and
be
buried
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
me
but
we
shall
live
first
my
heart
heart
i
laid
my
head
on
her
knee
a
strange
drowsiness
overcame
me
holding
her
hand
against
my
cheek
i
lost
consciousness
when
i
awoke
the
grey
november
dawn
was
glimmering
through
the
uncurtained
window
my
head
was
pillowed
on
my
arm
which
rested
i
raised
my
head
quickly
ah
not
on
my
lady
knee
but
on
the
cushion
of
the
chair
i
sprang
to
my
feet
i
was
stiff
with
cold
and
dazed
with
dreams
but
i
turned
my
eyes
on
the
picture
there
she
sat
my
lady
my
dear
love
i
held
out
my
arms
but
the
passionate
cry
i
would
have
uttered
died
on
my
lips
she
had
said
twelve
her
lightest
word
was
my
law
so
i
only
stood
in
front
of
the
picture
and
gazed
into
those
eyes
till
tears
of
passionate
happiness
filled
my
own
oh
my
dear
my
dear
how
shall
i
pass
the
hours
till
i
hold
you
again
no
thought
then
of
my
whole
life
completion
and
consummation
being
a
dream
i
staggered
up
to
my
room
fell
across
my
bed
and
slept
heavily
and
dreamlessly
when
i
awoke
it
was
high
noon
mildred
and
her
mother
were
coming
to
lunch
i
remembered
at
one
shock
mildred
coming
and
her
existence
now
indeed
the
dream
began
with
a
penetrating
sense
of
the
futility
of
any
action
apart
from
i
gave
the
necessary
orders
for
the
reception
of
my
guests
when
mildred
and
her
mother
came
i
received
them
with
cordiality
but
my
genial
phrases
all
seemed
to
be
some
one
else
my
voice
sounded
like
an
echo
my
heart
was
other
where
still
the
situation
was
not
intolerable
until
the
hour
when
afternoon
tea
was
served
in
the
mildred
and
her
mother
kept
the
conversational
pot
boiling
with
a
profusion
of
genteel
commonplaces
and
i
bore
it
as
one
can
bear
mild
purgatories
when
one
is
in
sight
of
heaven
i
looked
up
at
my
sweetheart
in
the
ebony
frame
and
i
felt
that
anything
that
might
happen
any
irresponsible
imbecility
any
bathos
of
boredom
was
nothing
if
after
it
all
came
to
me
again
and
yet
when
mildred
too
looked
at
the
portrait
and
said
what
a
fine
lady
one
of
your
flames
mr
devigne
i
had
a
sickening
sense
of
impotent
irritation
which
became
absolute
torture
when
mildred
how
could
i
ever
have
admired
that
barmaid
style
of
prettiness
threw
herself
into
the
chair
covering
the
needlework
with
her
ridiculous
flounces
and
added
silence
gives
consent
who
is
it
devigne
tell
us
all
about
her
i
am
sure
she
has
a
story
poor
little
mildred
sitting
there
smiling
serene
in
her
confidence
that
her
every
word
charmed
me
sitting
there
with
her
rather
pinched
waist
her
rather
tight
boots
her
rather
vulgar
voice
sitting
in
the
chair
where
my
dear
lady
had
sat
when
she
told
me
her
story
i
could
not
bear
it
do
sit
there
i
said
it
not
comfortable
but
the
girl
would
not
be
warned
with
a
laugh
that
set
every
nerve
in
my
body
vibrating
with
annoyance
she
said
oh
dear
must
i
even
sit
in
the
same
chair
as
your
woman
i
looked
at
the
chair
in
the
picture
it
the
same
and
in
her
chair
mildred
was
sitting
then
a
horrible
sense
of
the
reality
of
mildred
came
upon
me
was
all
this
a
reality
after
all
but
for
fortunate
chance
might
mildred
have
occupied
not
only
her
chair
but
her
place
in
my
life
i
rose
i
hope
you
wo
think
me
very
rude
i
said
but
i
am
obliged
to
go
out
i
forget
what
appointment
i
alleged
the
lie
came
readily
enough
i
faced
mildred
pouts
with
the
hope
that
she
and
her
mother
would
not
wait
dinner
for
me
i
fled
in
another
minute
i
was
safe
alone
under
the
chill
cloudy
autumn
sky
free
to
think
think
think
of
my
dear
lady
i
walked
for
hours
along
streets
and
squares
i
lived
over
again
and
again
every
look
word
and
every
kiss
i
was
completely
unspeakably
happy
mildred
was
utterly
forgotten
my
lady
of
the
ebony
frame
filled
my
heart
and
soul
and
spirit
as
i
heard
eleven
boom
through
the
fog
i
turned
and
went
home
when
i
got
to
my
street
i
found
a
crowd
surging
through
it
a
strong
red
light
filling
the
air
a
house
was
on
fire
mine
i
elbowed
my
way
through
the
crowd
the
picture
of
my
lady
that
at
least
i
could
save
as
i
sprang
up
the
steps
i
saw
as
in
a
dream
yes
all
this
was
i
saw
mildred
leaning
out
of
the
window
wringing
her
hands
come
back
sir
cried
a
fireman
we
get
the
young
lady
out
right
enough
but
lady
i
went
on
up
the
stairs
cracking
smoking
and
as
hot
as
hell
to
the
room
where
her
picture
was
strange
to
say
i
only
felt
that
the
picture
was
a
thing
we
should
like
to
look
on
through
the
long
glad
wedded
life
that
was
to
be
ours
i
never
thought
of
it
as
being
one
with
her
as
i
reached
the
first
floor
i
felt
arms
round
my
neck
the
smoke
was
too
thick
for
me
to
distinguish
features
save
me
a
voice
whispered
i
clasped
a
figure
in
my
arms
and
with
a
strange
bore
it
down
the
shaking
stairs
and
out
into
safety
it
was
mildred
i
knew
directly
i
clasped
her
stand
back
cried
the
crowd
every
one
safe
cried
a
fireman
the
flames
leaped
from
every
window
the
sky
grew
redder
and
redder
i
sprang
from
the
hands
that
would
have
held
me
i
leaped
up
the
steps
i
crawled
up
the
stairs
suddenly
the
whole
horror
of
the
situation
came
on
me
long
as
my
picture
remains
in
the
ebony
what
if
picture
and
frame
perished
together
i
fought
with
the
fire
and
with
my
own
choking
inability
to
fight
with
it
i
pushed
on
i
must
save
my
picture
i
reached
the
as
i
sprang
in
i
saw
my
lady
i
swear
it
through
the
smoke
and
the
flames
hold
out
her
arms
to
me
to
me
who
came
too
late
to
save
her
and
to
save
my
own
life
joy
i
never
saw
her
again
before
i
could
reach
her
or
cry
out
to
her
i
felt
the
floor
yield
beneath
my
feet
and
i
fell
into
the
fiery
hell
below
how
did
they
save
me
what
does
that
matter
they
saved
me
somehow
curse
them
every
stick
of
my
aunt
furniture
was
destroyed
my
friends
pointed
out
that
as
the
furniture
was
heavily
insured
the
carelessness
of
a
housemaid
had
done
me
no
harm
no
harm
that
was
how
i
won
and
lost
my
only
love
i
deny
with
all
my
soul
in
the
denial
that
it
was
a
dream
there
are
no
such
dreams
dreams
of
longing
and
pain
there
are
in
plenty
but
dreams
of
complete
of
unspeakable
happiness
ah
no
it
is
the
rest
of
life
that
is
the
dream
but
if
i
think
that
why
have
i
married
mildred
and
grown
stout
and
dull
and
prosperous
i
tell
you
it
is
all
that
is
the
dream
my
dear
lady
only
is
the
reality
and
what
does
it
matter
what
one
does
in
a
dream
john
charrington
wedding
no
one
ever
thought
that
may
forster
would
marry
john
charrington
but
he
thought
differently
and
things
which
john
charrington
intended
had
a
queer
way
of
coming
to
pass
he
asked
her
to
marry
him
before
he
went
up
to
oxford
she
laughed
and
refused
him
he
asked
her
again
next
time
he
came
home
again
she
laughed
tossed
her
dainty
blonde
head
and
again
refused
a
third
time
he
asked
her
she
said
it
was
becoming
a
confirmed
bad
habit
and
laughed
at
him
more
than
ever
john
was
not
the
only
man
who
wanted
to
marry
her
she
was
the
belle
of
our
village
and
we
were
all
in
love
with
her
more
or
less
it
was
a
sort
of
fashion
like
heliotrope
ties
or
inverness
capes
therefore
we
were
as
much
annoyed
as
surprised
when
john
charrington
walked
into
our
little
local
club
we
held
it
in
a
loft
over
the
saddler
i
remember
and
invited
us
all
to
his
wedding
your
wedding
you
do
mean
it
who
the
happy
fair
when
it
to
be
john
charrington
filled
his
pipe
and
lighted
it
before
he
replied
then
he
said
i
sorry
to
deprive
you
fellows
of
your
only
joke
but
miss
forster
and
i
are
to
be
married
in
september
you
do
mean
it
he
got
the
mitten
again
and
it
turned
his
head
no
i
said
rising
i
see
it
true
lend
me
a
pistol
some
one
or
a
fare
to
the
other
end
of
nowhere
charrington
has
bewitched
the
only
pretty
girl
in
our
radius
was
it
mesmerism
or
a
jack
neither
sir
but
a
gift
you
never
have
perseverance
and
the
best
luck
a
man
ever
had
in
this
world
there
was
something
in
his
voice
that
silenced
me
and
all
chaff
of
the
other
fellows
failed
to
draw
him
further
the
queer
thing
about
it
was
that
when
we
congratulated
miss
forster
she
blushed
and
smiled
and
dimpled
for
all
the
world
as
though
she
were
in
love
with
him
and
had
been
in
love
with
him
all
the
time
upon
my
word
i
think
she
had
women
are
strange
creatures
we
were
all
asked
to
the
wedding
in
brixham
every
one
who
was
anybody
knew
everybody
else
who
was
any
one
my
sisters
were
i
truly
believe
more
interested
in
the
than
the
bride
herself
and
i
was
to
be
best
man
the
coming
marriage
was
much
canvassed
at
afternoon
and
at
our
little
club
over
the
saddler
and
the
question
was
always
asked
does
she
care
for
him
i
used
to
ask
that
question
myself
in
the
early
days
of
their
engagement
but
after
a
certain
evening
in
august
i
never
asked
it
again
i
was
coming
home
from
the
club
through
the
churchyard
our
church
is
on
a
hill
and
the
turf
about
it
is
so
thick
and
soft
that
one
footsteps
are
noiseless
i
made
no
sound
as
i
vaulted
the
low
lichened
wall
and
threaded
my
way
between
the
tombstones
it
was
at
the
same
instant
that
i
heard
john
charrington
voice
and
saw
her
may
was
sitting
on
a
low
flat
gravestone
her
face
turned
towards
the
full
splendour
of
the
western
sun
its
expression
ended
at
once
and
for
ever
any
question
of
love
for
him
it
was
transfigured
to
a
beauty
i
should
not
have
believed
possible
even
to
that
beautiful
little
face
john
lay
at
her
feet
and
it
was
his
voice
that
broke
the
stillness
of
the
golden
august
evening
my
dear
my
dear
i
believe
i
should
come
back
from
the
dead
if
you
wanted
me
i
coughed
at
once
to
indicate
my
presence
and
passed
on
into
the
shadow
fully
enlightened
the
wedding
was
to
be
early
in
september
two
days
before
i
had
to
run
up
to
town
on
business
the
train
was
late
of
course
for
we
are
on
the
and
as
i
stood
grumbling
with
my
watch
in
my
hand
whom
should
i
see
but
john
charrington
and
may
forster
they
were
walking
up
and
down
the
unfrequented
end
of
the
platform
arm
in
arm
looking
into
each
other
eyes
careless
of
the
sympathetic
interest
of
the
porters
of
course
i
knew
better
than
to
hesitate
a
moment
before
burying
myself
in
the
and
it
was
not
till
the
train
drew
up
at
the
platform
that
i
obtrusively
passed
the
pair
with
my
gladstone
and
took
the
corner
in
a
i
did
this
with
as
good
an
air
of
not
seeing
them
as
i
could
assume
i
pride
myself
on
my
discretion
but
if
john
were
travelling
alone
i
wanted
his
company
i
had
it
hullo
old
man
came
his
cheery
voice
as
he
swung
his
bag
into
my
carriage
here
luck
i
was
expecting
a
dull
journey
where
are
you
off
to
i
asked
discretion
still
bidding
me
turn
my
eyes
away
though
i
saw
without
looking
that
hers
were
to
old
branbridge
he
answered
shutting
the
door
and
leaning
out
for
a
last
word
with
his
sweetheart
oh
i
wish
you
would
go
john
she
was
saying
in
a
low
earnest
voice
i
feel
certain
something
will
happen
do
you
think
i
should
let
anything
happen
to
keep
me
and
the
day
after
our
do
go
she
answered
with
a
pleading
intensity
which
would
have
sent
my
gladstone
on
to
the
platform
and
me
after
it
but
she
speaking
to
me
john
charrington
was
made
differently
he
rarely
changed
his
opinions
never
his
resolutions
he
only
stroked
the
little
ungloved
hands
that
lay
on
the
carriage
door
i
must
may
the
old
boy
been
awfully
good
to
me
and
now
he
dying
i
must
go
and
see
him
but
i
shall
come
home
in
time
for
the
rest
of
the
parting
was
lost
in
a
whisper
and
in
the
rattling
lurch
of
the
starting
train
you
sure
to
come
she
spoke
as
the
train
moved
nothing
shall
keep
me
he
answered
and
we
steamed
out
after
he
had
seen
the
last
of
the
little
figure
on
the
platform
he
leaned
back
in
his
corner
and
kept
silence
for
a
minute
when
he
spoke
it
was
to
explain
to
me
that
his
godfather
whose
heir
he
was
lay
dying
at
peasmarsh
place
some
fifty
miles
away
and
had
sent
for
john
and
john
had
felt
bound
to
go
i
shall
be
surely
back
he
said
or
if
not
the
day
after
in
heaps
of
time
thank
heaven
one
has
to
get
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
get
married
nowadays
and
suppose
branbridge
dies
alive
or
dead
i
mean
to
be
married
on
thursday
john
answered
lighting
a
cigar
and
unfolding
the
at
peasmarsh
station
we
said
and
he
got
out
and
i
saw
him
ride
off
i
went
on
to
london
where
i
stayed
the
night
when
i
got
home
the
next
afternoon
a
very
wet
one
by
the
way
my
sister
greeted
me
with
where
mr
charrington
goodness
knows
i
answered
testily
every
man
since
cain
has
resented
that
kind
of
question
i
thought
you
might
have
heard
from
him
she
went
on
as
you
to
give
him
away
is
he
back
i
asked
for
i
had
confidently
expected
to
find
him
at
home
no
geoffrey
my
sister
fanny
always
had
a
way
of
jumping
to
conclusions
especially
such
conclusions
as
were
least
favourable
to
her
he
has
not
returned
and
what
is
more
you
may
depend
upon
it
he
wo
you
mark
my
words
there
be
no
wedding
my
sister
fanny
has
a
power
of
annoying
me
which
no
other
human
being
possesses
you
mark
my
words
i
retorted
with
asperity
you
had
better
give
up
making
such
a
thundering
idiot
of
yourself
there
be
more
wedding
than
ever
you
take
the
first
part
in
a
prophecy
which
by
the
way
came
true
but
though
i
could
snarl
confidently
to
my
sister
i
did
not
feel
so
comfortable
when
late
that
night
i
standing
on
the
doorstep
of
house
heard
that
he
had
not
returned
i
went
home
gloomily
through
the
rain
next
morning
brought
a
brilliant
blue
sky
gold
sun
and
all
such
softness
of
air
and
beauty
of
cloud
as
go
to
make
up
a
perfect
day
i
woke
with
a
vague
feeling
of
having
gone
to
bed
anxious
and
of
being
rather
averse
to
facing
that
anxiety
in
the
light
of
full
wakefulness
but
with
my
came
a
note
from
john
which
relieved
my
mind
and
sent
me
up
to
the
forsters
with
a
light
heart
may
was
in
the
garden
i
saw
her
blue
gown
through
the
hollyhocks
as
the
lodge
gates
swung
to
behind
me
so
i
did
not
go
up
to
the
house
but
turned
aside
down
the
turfed
path
he
written
to
you
too
she
said
without
preliminary
greeting
when
i
reached
her
side
yes
i
to
meet
him
at
the
station
at
three
and
come
straight
on
to
the
church
her
face
looked
pale
but
there
was
a
brightness
in
her
eyes
and
a
tender
quiver
about
the
mouth
that
spoke
of
renewed
happiness
branbridge
begged
him
so
to
stay
another
night
that
he
had
not
the
heart
to
refuse
she
went
on
he
is
so
kind
but
i
wish
he
stayed
i
was
at
the
station
at
two
i
felt
rather
annoyed
with
john
it
seemed
a
sort
of
slight
to
the
beautiful
girl
who
loved
him
that
he
should
come
as
it
were
out
of
breath
and
with
the
dust
of
travel
upon
him
to
take
her
hand
which
some
of
us
would
have
given
the
best
years
of
our
lives
to
take
but
when
the
three
train
glided
in
and
glided
out
again
having
brought
no
passengers
to
our
little
station
i
was
more
than
annoyed
there
was
no
other
train
for
minutes
i
calculated
that
with
much
hurry
we
might
just
get
to
the
church
in
time
for
the
ceremony
but
oh
what
a
fool
to
miss
that
first
train
what
other
man
could
have
done
it
that
minutes
seemed
a
year
as
i
wandered
round
the
station
reading
the
advertisements
and
the
and
the
and
getting
more
and
more
angry
with
john
charrington
this
confidence
in
his
own
power
of
getting
everything
he
wanted
the
minute
he
wanted
it
was
leading
him
too
far
i
hate
waiting
every
one
does
but
i
believe
i
hate
it
more
than
any
one
else
the
three
was
late
of
course
i
ground
my
pipe
between
my
teeth
and
stamped
with
impatience
as
i
watched
the
signals
click
the
signal
went
down
five
minutes
later
i
flung
myself
into
the
carriage
that
i
had
brought
for
john
drive
to
the
church
i
said
as
some
one
shut
the
door
charrington
has
come
by
this
train
anxiety
now
replaced
anger
what
had
become
of
the
man
could
he
have
been
taken
suddenly
ill
i
had
never
known
him
have
a
day
illness
in
his
life
and
even
so
he
might
have
telegraphed
some
awful
accident
must
have
happened
to
him
the
thought
that
he
had
played
her
false
never
no
not
for
a
moment
entered
my
head
yes
something
terrible
had
happened
to
him
and
on
me
lay
the
task
of
telling
his
bride
i
almost
wished
the
carriage
would
upset
and
break
my
head
so
that
some
one
else
might
tell
her
not
i
who
but
that
nothing
to
do
with
his
story
it
was
five
minutes
to
four
as
we
drew
up
at
the
churchyard
gate
a
double
row
of
eager
lined
the
path
from
lychgate
to
porch
i
sprang
from
the
carriage
and
passed
up
between
them
our
gardener
had
a
good
front
place
near
the
door
i
stopped
are
they
waiting
still
byles
i
asked
simply
to
gain
time
for
of
course
i
knew
they
were
by
the
waiting
crowd
attentive
attitude
waiting
sir
no
no
sir
why
it
must
be
over
by
now
over
then
charrington
come
to
the
minute
sir
must
have
missed
you
somehow
and
i
say
sir
lowering
his
voice
i
never
see
john
the
least
bit
so
afore
but
my
opinion
is
he
been
drinking
pretty
free
his
clothes
was
all
dusty
and
his
face
like
a
sheet
i
tell
you
i
did
like
the
looks
of
him
at
all
and
the
folks
inside
are
saying
all
sorts
of
things
you
see
something
gone
very
wrong
with
john
and
he
tried
liquor
he
looked
like
a
ghost
and
in
he
went
with
his
eyes
straight
before
him
with
never
a
look
or
a
word
for
none
of
us
him
that
was
always
such
a
gentleman
i
had
never
heard
byles
make
so
long
a
speech
the
crowd
in
the
churchyard
were
talking
in
whispers
and
getting
ready
rice
and
slippers
to
throw
at
the
bride
and
bridegroom
the
ringers
were
ready
with
their
hands
on
the
ropes
to
ring
out
the
merry
peal
as
the
bride
and
bridegroom
should
come
out
a
murmur
from
the
church
announced
them
out
they
came
byles
was
right
john
charrington
did
not
look
himself
there
was
dust
on
his
coat
his
hair
was
disarranged
he
seemed
to
have
been
in
some
row
for
there
was
a
black
mark
above
his
eyebrow
he
was
deathly
pale
but
his
pallor
was
not
greater
than
that
of
the
bride
who
might
have
been
carved
in
ivory
dress
veil
orange
blossoms
face
and
all
as
they
passed
out
the
ringers
stooped
there
were
six
of
them
and
then
on
the
ears
expecting
the
gay
wedding
peal
came
the
slow
tolling
of
the
passing
bell
a
thrill
of
horror
at
so
foolish
a
jest
from
the
ringers
passed
through
us
all
but
the
ringers
themselves
dropped
the
ropes
and
fled
like
rabbits
out
into
the
sunlight
the
bride
shuddered
and
grey
shadows
came
about
her
mouth
but
the
bridegroom
led
her
on
down
the
path
where
the
people
stood
with
the
handfuls
of
rice
but
the
handfuls
were
never
thrown
and
the
never
rang
in
vain
the
ringers
were
urged
to
remedy
their
mistake
they
protested
with
many
whispered
expletives
that
they
would
see
themselves
further
first
in
a
hush
like
the
hush
in
the
chamber
of
death
the
bridal
pair
passed
into
their
carriage
and
its
door
slammed
behind
them
then
the
tongues
were
loosed
a
babel
of
anger
wonder
conjecture
from
the
guests
and
the
spectators
if
i
seen
his
condition
sir
said
old
forster
to
me
as
we
drove
off
i
would
have
stretched
him
on
the
floor
of
the
church
sir
by
heaven
i
would
before
i
have
let
him
marry
my
daughter
then
he
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
drive
like
hell
he
cried
to
the
coachman
do
spare
the
horses
he
was
obeyed
we
passed
the
bride
carriage
i
forebore
to
look
at
it
and
old
forster
turned
his
head
away
and
swore
we
reached
home
before
it
we
stood
in
the
hall
doorway
in
the
blazing
afternoon
sun
and
in
about
half
a
minute
we
heard
wheels
crunching
the
gravel
when
the
carriage
stopped
in
front
of
the
steps
old
forster
and
i
ran
down
great
heaven
the
carriage
is
empty
and
yet
i
had
the
door
open
in
a
minute
and
this
is
what
i
saw
no
sign
of
john
charrington
and
of
may
his
wife
only
a
huddled
heap
of
white
satin
lying
half
on
the
floor
of
the
carriage
and
half
on
the
seat
i
drove
straight
here
sir
said
the
coachman
as
the
bride
father
lifted
her
out
and
i
swear
no
one
got
out
of
the
carriage
we
carried
her
into
the
house
in
her
bridal
dress
and
drew
back
her
veil
i
saw
her
face
shall
i
ever
forget
it
white
white
and
drawn
with
agony
and
horror
bearing
such
a
look
of
terror
as
i
have
never
seen
since
except
in
dreams
and
her
hair
her
radiant
blonde
hair
i
tell
you
it
was
white
like
snow
as
we
stood
her
father
and
i
half
mad
with
the
horror
and
mystery
of
it
a
boy
came
up
the
avenue
a
telegraph
boy
they
brought
the
orange
envelope
to
me
i
tore
it
open
charrington
was
thrown
from
the
dogcart
on
his
way
to
the
station
at
one
killed
on
the
spot
and
he
was
married
to
may
forster
in
our
parish
church
at
in
presence
of
half
the
parish
shall
be
married
dead
or
alive
what
had
passed
in
that
carriage
on
the
homeward
drive
no
one
knows
no
one
will
ever
know
oh
may
oh
my
dear
before
a
week
was
over
they
laid
her
beside
her
husband
in
our
little
churchyard
on
the
hill
the
churchyard
where
they
had
kept
their
thus
was
accomplished
john
charrington
wedding
abraham
no
my
dear
my
uncle
abraham
answered
me
no
nothing
romantic
ever
happened
to
me
unless
but
no
that
was
romantic
either
i
was
to
me
i
being
eighteen
romance
was
the
world
my
uncle
abraham
was
old
and
lame
i
followed
the
gaze
of
his
faded
eyes
and
my
own
rested
on
a
miniature
that
hung
at
his
right
hand
a
portrait
of
a
woman
whose
loveliness
even
the
art
had
been
powerless
to
disguise
a
woman
with
large
lustrous
eyes
and
perfect
oval
face
i
rose
to
look
at
it
i
had
looked
at
it
a
hundred
times
often
enough
in
my
baby
days
i
had
asked
who
that
uncle
always
receiving
the
same
answer
a
lady
who
died
long
ago
my
dear
as
i
looked
again
at
the
picture
i
asked
was
she
like
this
who
your
your
romance
uncle
abraham
looked
hard
at
me
yes
he
said
at
last
very
very
like
i
sat
down
on
the
floor
by
him
wo
you
tell
me
about
her
there
nothing
to
tell
he
said
i
think
it
was
fancy
mostly
and
folly
but
it
the
realest
thing
in
my
long
life
my
dear
a
long
pause
i
kept
silence
hurry
no
man
cattle
is
a
good
motto
especially
with
old
people
i
remember
he
said
in
the
dreamy
tone
always
promising
so
well
to
the
ear
that
a
story
delighteth
i
remember
when
i
was
a
young
man
i
was
very
lonely
indeed
i
never
had
a
sweetheart
i
was
always
lame
my
dear
from
quite
a
boy
and
the
girls
used
to
laugh
at
me
he
sighed
presently
he
went
on
and
so
i
got
into
the
way
of
mooning
off
by
myself
in
lonely
places
and
one
of
my
favourite
walks
was
up
through
our
churchyard
which
was
set
high
on
a
hill
in
the
middle
of
the
marsh
country
i
liked
that
because
i
never
met
any
one
there
it
all
over
years
ago
i
was
a
silly
lad
but
i
could
bear
of
a
summer
evening
to
hear
a
rustle
and
a
whisper
from
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
or
maybe
a
kiss
as
i
went
by
well
i
used
to
go
and
sit
all
by
myself
in
the
churchyard
which
was
always
sweet
with
thyme
and
quite
light
on
account
of
its
being
so
high
long
after
the
marshes
were
dark
i
used
to
watch
the
bats
flitting
about
in
the
red
light
and
wonder
why
god
did
make
every
one
legs
straight
and
strong
and
wicked
follies
like
that
but
by
the
time
the
light
was
gone
i
had
always
worked
it
off
so
to
speak
and
could
go
home
quietly
and
say
my
prayers
without
any
bitterness
well
one
hot
night
in
august
when
i
had
watched
the
sunset
fade
and
the
crescent
moon
grow
golden
i
was
just
stepping
over
the
low
stone
wall
of
the
churchyard
when
i
heard
a
rustle
behind
me
i
turned
round
expecting
it
to
be
a
rabbit
or
a
bird
it
was
a
woman
he
looked
at
the
portrait
so
did
i
yes
he
said
that
was
her
very
face
i
was
a
bit
scared
and
said
something
i
do
know
what
and
she
laughed
and
said
i
think
she
was
a
ghost
and
i
answered
back
and
i
stayed
talking
to
her
over
the
churchyard
wall
till
was
quite
dark
and
the
glowworms
were
out
in
the
wet
grass
all
along
the
way
home
next
night
i
saw
her
again
and
the
next
night
and
the
next
always
at
twilight
time
and
if
i
passed
any
lovers
leaning
on
the
stiles
in
the
marshes
it
was
nothing
to
me
now
again
my
uncle
paused
it
very
long
ago
he
said
slowly
and
i
an
old
man
but
i
know
what
youth
means
and
happiness
though
i
was
always
lame
and
the
girls
used
to
laugh
at
me
i
do
know
how
long
it
went
on
you
do
measure
time
in
dreams
but
at
last
your
grandfather
said
i
looked
as
if
i
had
one
foot
in
the
grave
and
he
would
be
sending
me
to
stay
with
our
kin
at
bath
and
take
the
waters
i
had
to
go
i
could
not
tell
my
father
why
i
would
rather
had
died
than
go
what
was
her
name
uncle
i
asked
she
never
would
tell
me
her
name
and
why
should
she
i
had
names
enough
in
my
heart
to
call
her
by
marriage
my
dear
even
then
i
knew
marriage
was
not
for
me
but
i
met
her
night
after
night
always
in
our
churchyard
where
the
were
and
the
lichened
gravestones
it
was
there
we
always
met
and
always
parted
the
last
time
was
the
night
before
i
went
away
she
was
very
sad
and
dearer
than
life
itself
and
she
said
you
come
back
before
the
new
moon
i
shall
meet
you
here
just
as
usual
but
if
the
new
moon
shines
on
this
grave
and
you
are
not
here
you
will
never
see
me
again
any
more
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
yellow
lichened
tomb
against
which
we
had
been
leaning
it
was
an
old
stone
and
bore
on
it
the
inscription
kingsnorth
shall
be
here
i
said
mean
it
she
said
with
deep
and
sudden
seriousness
is
no
fancy
you
will
be
here
when
the
new
moon
shines
i
promised
and
after
a
while
we
parted
i
had
been
with
my
kinsfolk
at
bath
nearly
a
month
i
was
to
go
home
on
the
next
day
when
turning
over
a
case
in
the
parlour
i
came
upon
that
miniature
i
could
not
speak
for
a
minute
at
last
i
said
with
dry
tongue
and
heart
beating
to
the
tune
of
heaven
and
hell
is
this
said
my
aunt
she
was
betrothed
to
one
of
our
family
many
years
ago
but
she
died
before
the
wedding
they
say
she
was
a
bit
of
a
witch
a
handsome
one
was
she
i
looked
again
at
the
face
the
lips
the
eyes
of
my
dear
and
lovely
love
whom
i
was
to
meet
night
when
the
new
moon
shone
on
that
tomb
in
our
churchyard
you
say
she
was
dead
i
asked
and
i
hardly
knew
my
own
voice
and
years
ago
her
name
on
the
back
and
her
date
i
took
the
portrait
from
its
faded
bed
and
read
on
the
back
kingsnorth
that
was
in
my
uncle
stopped
short
what
happened
i
asked
breathlessly
i
believe
i
had
a
fit
my
uncle
answered
slowly
at
any
rate
i
was
very
and
you
missed
the
new
moon
on
the
grave
i
missed
the
new
moon
on
the
grave
and
you
never
saw
her
again
i
never
saw
her
again
but
uncle
do
you
really
believe
can
the
dead
was
she
did
you
my
uncle
took
out
his
pipe
and
filled
it
it
a
long
time
ago
he
said
a
many
many
years
old
man
tales
my
dear
old
man
tales
do
you
take
any
notice
of
them
he
lighted
the
pipe
puffed
silently
a
moment
or
two
and
then
added
but
i
know
what
youth
means
and
happiness
though
i
was
lame
and
the
girls
used
to
laugh
at
me
mystery
of
the
he
was
waiting
for
her
he
had
been
waiting
an
hour
and
a
half
in
a
dusty
suburban
lane
with
a
row
of
big
elms
on
one
side
and
some
eligible
building
sites
on
the
other
and
far
away
to
the
the
twinkling
yellow
lights
of
the
crystal
palace
it
was
not
quite
like
a
country
lane
for
it
had
a
pavement
and
but
it
was
not
a
bad
place
for
a
meeting
all
the
same
and
farther
up
towards
the
cemetery
it
was
really
quite
rural
and
almost
pretty
especially
in
twilight
but
twilight
had
long
deepened
into
night
and
still
he
waited
he
loved
her
and
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
her
with
the
complete
disapproval
of
every
reasonable
person
who
had
been
consulted
and
this
meeting
was
to
take
the
place
of
the
grudgingly
sanctioned
weekly
interview
because
a
certain
rich
uncle
was
visiting
at
her
house
and
her
mother
was
not
the
woman
to
acknowledge
to
a
moneyed
uncle
who
might
go
off
any
day
a
match
so
deeply
ineligible
as
hers
with
him
so
he
waited
for
her
and
the
chill
of
an
unusually
severe
may
evening
entered
into
his
bones
the
policeman
passed
him
with
but
a
surly
response
to
his
good
night
the
bicyclists
went
by
him
like
grey
ghosts
with
and
it
was
nearly
ten
and
she
had
not
come
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
towards
his
lodgings
his
road
led
him
by
her
house
desirable
commodious
and
he
walked
slowly
as
he
neared
it
she
might
even
now
be
coming
out
but
she
was
not
there
was
no
sign
of
movement
about
the
house
no
sign
of
life
no
lights
even
in
the
windows
and
her
people
were
not
early
people
he
paused
by
the
gate
wondering
then
he
noticed
that
the
front
door
was
open
wide
open
and
the
street
lamp
shone
a
little
way
into
the
dark
hall
there
was
something
about
all
this
that
did
not
please
him
that
scared
him
a
little
indeed
the
house
had
a
gloomy
and
deserted
air
it
was
obviously
impossible
that
it
harboured
a
rich
uncle
the
old
man
must
have
left
early
in
which
case
he
walked
up
the
path
of
tiles
and
listened
no
sign
of
life
he
passed
into
the
hall
there
was
no
light
anywhere
where
was
everybody
and
why
was
the
front
door
open
there
was
no
one
in
the
the
and
the
study
nine
feet
by
seven
were
equally
blank
every
one
was
out
evidently
but
the
unpleasant
sense
that
he
was
perhaps
not
the
first
casual
visitor
to
walk
through
that
open
door
impelled
him
to
look
through
the
house
before
he
went
away
and
closed
it
after
him
so
he
went
upstairs
and
at
the
door
of
the
first
bedroom
he
came
to
he
struck
a
wax
match
as
he
had
done
in
the
even
as
he
did
so
he
felt
that
he
was
not
alone
and
he
was
prepared
to
see
but
for
what
he
saw
he
was
not
prepared
for
what
he
saw
lay
on
the
bed
in
a
white
loose
gown
and
it
was
his
sweetheart
and
its
throat
was
cut
from
ear
to
ear
he
know
what
happened
then
nor
how
he
got
downstairs
and
into
the
street
but
he
got
out
somehow
and
the
policeman
found
him
in
a
fit
under
the
at
the
corner
of
the
street
he
could
speak
when
they
picked
him
up
and
he
passed
the
night
in
the
because
the
policeman
had
seen
plenty
of
drunken
men
before
but
never
one
in
a
fit
the
next
morning
he
was
better
though
still
very
white
and
shaky
but
the
tale
he
told
the
magistrate
was
convincing
and
they
sent
a
couple
of
constables
with
him
to
her
house
there
was
no
crowd
about
it
as
he
had
fancied
there
would
be
and
the
blinds
were
not
down
as
he
stood
dazed
in
front
of
the
door
it
opened
and
she
came
out
he
held
on
to
the
for
support
all
right
you
see
said
the
constable
who
had
found
him
under
the
lamp
i
told
you
you
was
drunk
but
you
know
best
when
he
was
alone
with
her
he
told
her
not
all
for
that
would
not
bear
telling
but
how
he
had
come
into
the
commodious
and
how
he
had
found
the
door
open
and
the
lights
out
and
that
he
had
been
into
that
long
back
room
facing
the
stairs
and
had
seen
something
in
even
trying
to
hint
at
which
he
turned
sick
and
broke
down
and
had
to
have
brandy
given
him
but
my
dearest
she
said
i
dare
say
the
house
was
dark
for
we
were
all
at
the
crystal
palace
with
my
uncle
and
no
doubt
the
door
was
open
for
the
maids
run
out
if
they
left
but
you
could
not
have
been
in
that
room
because
i
locked
it
when
i
came
away
and
the
key
was
in
my
pocket
i
dressed
in
a
hurry
and
i
left
all
my
odds
and
ends
lying
about
i
know
he
said
i
saw
a
green
scarf
on
a
chair
and
some
long
brown
gloves
and
a
lot
of
hairpins
and
ribbons
and
a
and
a
lace
handkerchief
on
the
why
i
even
noticed
the
almanack
on
the
mantelpiece
october
at
least
it
could
be
that
because
this
is
may
and
yet
it
was
your
almanac
is
at
october
is
it
no
of
course
it
is
she
said
smiling
rather
anxiously
but
all
the
other
things
were
just
as
you
say
you
must
have
had
a
dream
or
a
vision
or
something
he
was
a
very
ordinary
commonplace
city
young
man
and
he
believe
in
visions
but
he
never
rested
day
or
night
till
he
got
his
sweetheart
and
her
mother
away
from
that
commodious
and
settled
them
in
a
quite
distant
suburb
in
the
course
of
the
removal
he
incidentally
married
her
and
the
mother
went
on
living
with
them
his
nerves
must
have
been
a
good
bit
shaken
because
he
was
very
queer
for
a
long
time
and
was
always
inquiring
if
any
one
had
taken
the
desirable
and
when
an
old
stockbroker
with
a
family
took
it
he
went
the
length
of
calling
on
the
old
gentleman
and
imploring
him
by
all
that
he
held
dear
not
to
live
in
that
fatal
house
why
said
the
stockbroker
not
unnaturally
and
then
he
got
so
vague
and
confused
between
trying
to
tell
why
and
trying
not
to
tell
why
that
the
stockbroker
showed
him
out
and
thanked
his
god
he
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
allow
a
lunatic
to
stand
in
the
way
of
his
taking
that
really
remarkably
cheap
and
desirable
residence
now
the
curious
and
quite
inexplicable
part
of
this
story
is
that
when
she
came
down
to
breakfast
on
the
morning
of
the
of
october
she
found
him
looking
like
death
with
the
morning
paper
in
his
hand
he
caught
hers
he
could
speak
and
pointed
to
the
paper
and
there
she
read
that
on
the
night
of
the
a
young
lady
the
daughter
had
been
found
with
her
throat
cut
from
ear
to
ear
on
the
bed
in
the
long
back
bedroom
facing
the
stairs
of
that
desirable
the
i
but
true
or
not
true
your
brother
is
a
scoundrel
no
man
no
decent
man
tells
such
things
he
did
not
tell
me
how
dare
you
suppose
it
i
found
the
letter
in
his
desk
and
she
being
my
friend
and
you
being
her
lover
i
never
thought
there
could
be
any
harm
in
my
reading
her
letter
to
my
brother
give
me
back
the
letter
i
was
a
fool
to
tell
you
ida
helmont
held
out
her
hand
for
the
letter
not
yet
i
said
and
i
went
to
the
window
the
dull
red
of
a
london
sunset
burned
on
the
paper
as
i
read
in
the
quaint
dainty
handwriting
i
knew
so
well
and
had
kissed
so
often
dear
i
do
i
do
love
you
but
it
impossible
i
must
marry
arthur
my
honour
is
engaged
if
he
would
only
set
me
free
but
he
never
will
he
loves
me
so
foolishly
but
as
for
me
it
is
you
i
love
body
soul
and
spirit
there
is
no
one
in
my
heart
but
you
i
think
of
you
all
day
and
dream
of
you
all
night
and
we
must
part
and
that
is
the
way
of
the
world
yours
yours
yours
elvire
i
had
seen
the
handwriting
indeed
often
enough
but
the
passion
written
there
was
new
to
me
that
i
had
not
seen
i
turned
from
the
window
wearily
my
looked
strange
to
me
there
were
my
books
my
my
untasted
dinner
still
on
the
table
as
i
had
left
it
when
i
rose
to
dissemble
my
surprise
at
ida
helmont
visit
ida
helmont
who
now
sat
in
my
looking
at
me
quietly
well
do
you
give
me
no
thanks
you
put
a
knife
in
my
heart
and
then
ask
for
thanks
pardon
me
she
said
throwing
up
her
chin
i
have
done
nothing
but
show
you
the
truth
for
that
one
should
expect
no
gratitude
may
i
ask
out
of
mere
curiosity
what
you
intend
to
do
your
brother
will
tell
you
she
rose
suddenly
pale
to
the
lips
you
will
not
tell
my
brother
she
began
that
you
have
read
his
private
letters
certainly
not
she
came
towards
me
her
gold
hair
flaming
in
the
sunset
light
why
are
you
so
angry
with
me
she
said
be
reasonable
what
else
could
i
do
i
do
know
would
it
have
been
right
not
to
tell
you
i
do
know
i
only
know
that
you
put
the
sun
out
and
i
got
used
to
the
dark
yet
believe
me
she
said
coming
still
nearer
to
me
and
laying
her
hands
in
the
lightest
light
touch
on
my
shoulders
believe
me
she
never
loved
you
there
was
a
softness
in
her
tone
that
irritated
and
stimulated
me
i
moved
gently
back
and
her
hands
fell
by
her
sides
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
i
have
behaved
very
badly
you
were
quite
right
to
come
and
i
am
not
ungrateful
will
you
post
a
letter
for
me
i
sat
down
and
wrote
i
give
you
back
your
freedom
the
only
gift
of
mine
that
can
please
you
now
arthur
i
held
the
sheet
out
to
miss
helmont
and
when
she
had
glanced
at
it
i
sealed
stamped
and
addressed
it
i
said
then
and
gave
her
the
letter
as
the
door
closed
behind
her
i
sank
into
my
chair
and
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
cried
like
a
child
or
a
fool
over
my
lost
plaything
the
little
woman
who
loved
some
one
else
with
body
soul
and
spirit
i
did
not
hear
the
door
open
or
any
foot
on
the
floor
and
therefore
i
started
when
a
voice
behind
me
said
are
you
so
very
unhappy
oh
arthur
do
think
i
am
not
sorry
for
you
i
do
want
any
one
to
be
sorry
for
me
miss
helmont
i
said
she
was
silent
a
moment
then
with
a
quick
sudden
gentle
movement
she
leaned
down
and
kissed
my
forehead
and
i
heard
the
door
softly
close
then
i
knew
that
the
beautiful
miss
helmont
loved
me
at
first
that
thought
only
fleeted
by
a
light
cloud
against
a
grey
sky
but
the
next
day
reason
woke
and
said
was
miss
helmont
speaking
the
truth
was
it
possible
that
i
determined
to
see
elvire
to
know
from
her
own
lips
whether
by
happy
fortune
this
blow
came
not
from
her
but
from
a
woman
in
whom
love
might
have
killed
honesty
i
walked
from
hampstead
to
gower
street
as
i
trod
its
long
length
i
saw
a
figure
in
pink
come
out
of
one
of
the
houses
it
was
elvire
she
walked
in
front
of
me
to
the
corner
of
store
street
there
she
met
oscar
helmont
they
turned
and
met
me
face
to
face
and
i
saw
all
i
needed
to
see
they
loved
each
other
ida
helmont
had
spoken
the
truth
i
bowed
and
passed
on
before
six
months
were
gone
they
were
married
and
before
a
year
was
over
i
had
married
ida
helmont
what
did
it
i
do
know
whether
it
was
remorse
for
having
even
for
half
a
day
dreamed
that
she
could
be
so
base
as
to
forge
a
lie
to
gain
a
lover
or
whether
it
was
her
beauty
or
the
sweet
flattery
of
the
preference
of
a
woman
who
had
half
her
acquaintances
at
her
feet
i
do
know
anyhow
my
thoughts
turned
to
her
as
to
their
natural
home
my
heart
too
took
that
road
and
before
very
long
i
loved
her
as
i
had
never
loved
elvire
let
no
one
doubt
that
i
loved
her
as
i
shall
never
love
again
please
god
there
never
was
any
one
like
her
she
was
brave
and
beautiful
witty
and
wise
and
beyond
all
measure
adorable
she
was
the
only
woman
in
the
world
there
was
a
frankness
a
largeness
of
heart
about
her
that
made
all
other
women
seem
small
and
contemptible
she
loved
me
and
i
worshipped
her
i
married
her
i
stayed
with
her
for
three
golden
weeks
and
then
i
left
her
why
because
she
told
me
the
truth
it
was
one
night
late
we
had
sat
all
the
evening
in
the
verandah
of
our
seaside
lodging
watching
the
moonlight
on
the
water
and
listening
to
the
soft
sound
of
the
sea
on
the
sand
i
have
never
been
so
happy
i
never
shall
be
happy
any
more
i
hope
heart
heart
she
said
leaning
her
gold
head
against
my
shoulder
how
much
do
you
love
me
how
much
yes
how
much
i
want
to
know
what
place
it
is
i
hold
in
your
heart
am
i
more
to
you
than
any
one
else
my
love
more
than
yourself
more
than
my
life
i
believe
you
she
said
then
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
took
my
hands
in
hers
it
can
make
no
difference
nothing
in
heaven
or
earth
can
come
between
us
now
nothing
i
said
but
sweet
my
wife
what
is
it
for
she
was
deathly
pale
i
must
tell
you
she
said
i
can
not
hide
anything
now
from
you
because
i
am
yours
body
soul
and
spirit
the
phrase
was
an
echo
that
stung
me
the
moonlight
shone
on
her
gold
hair
her
warm
soft
gold
hair
and
on
her
pale
face
arthur
she
said
you
remember
my
coming
to
you
at
hampstead
with
that
letter
yes
my
sweet
and
i
remember
how
you
arthur
she
spoke
fast
and
low
arthur
that
letter
was
a
forgery
she
never
wrote
it
i
she
stopped
for
i
had
risen
and
flung
her
hands
from
me
and
stood
looking
at
her
god
help
me
i
thought
it
was
anger
at
the
lie
i
felt
i
know
now
it
was
only
wounded
vanity
that
smarted
in
me
that
should
have
been
tricked
that
should
have
been
deceived
that
should
have
been
led
on
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
that
should
have
married
the
woman
who
had
befooled
me
at
that
moment
she
was
no
longer
the
wife
i
adored
she
was
only
a
woman
who
had
forged
a
letter
and
tricked
me
into
marrying
her
i
spoke
i
denounced
her
i
said
i
would
never
speak
to
her
again
i
felt
it
was
rather
creditable
in
me
to
be
so
angry
i
said
i
would
have
no
more
to
do
with
a
liar
and
forger
i
do
know
whether
i
expected
her
to
creep
to
my
knees
and
implore
forgiveness
i
think
i
had
some
vague
idea
that
i
could
consent
with
dignity
to
forgive
and
forget
i
did
not
mean
what
i
said
no
no
i
did
not
mean
a
word
of
it
while
i
was
saying
it
i
was
longing
for
her
to
weep
and
fall
at
my
feet
that
i
might
raise
her
and
hold
her
in
my
arms
again
but
she
did
not
fall
at
my
feet
she
stood
quietly
looking
at
me
arthur
she
said
as
i
paused
for
breath
let
me
explain
she
i
there
is
nothing
to
explain
i
said
hotly
still
with
that
foolish
sense
of
there
being
something
rather
noble
in
my
indignation
as
one
feels
when
one
calls
one
self
a
miserable
sinner
you
are
a
liar
and
forger
and
that
is
enough
for
me
i
will
never
speak
to
you
again
you
have
wrecked
my
life
do
you
mean
that
she
said
interrupting
me
and
leaning
forward
to
look
at
me
tears
lay
on
her
cheeks
but
she
was
not
crying
now
i
hesitated
i
longed
to
take
her
in
my
arms
and
say
lay
your
head
here
my
darling
and
cry
here
and
know
how
i
love
you
but
instead
i
kept
silence
you
mean
it
she
persisted
then
she
put
her
hand
on
my
arm
i
longed
to
clasp
it
and
draw
her
to
me
instead
i
shook
it
off
and
said
mean
it
yes
of
course
i
mean
it
do
touch
me
please
you
have
ruined
my
life
she
turned
away
without
a
word
went
into
our
room
and
shut
the
door
i
longed
to
follow
her
to
tell
her
that
if
there
was
anything
to
forgive
i
forgave
it
instead
i
went
out
on
the
beach
and
walked
away
under
the
cliffs
the
moonlight
and
the
solitude
however
presently
brought
me
to
a
better
mind
whatever
she
had
done
had
been
done
for
love
of
me
i
knew
that
i
would
go
home
and
tell
her
so
tell
her
that
whatever
she
had
done
she
was
my
dearest
life
my
heart
one
treasure
true
my
ideal
of
her
was
shattered
but
even
as
she
was
what
was
the
whole
world
of
women
compared
to
her
i
hurried
back
but
in
my
resentment
and
evil
temper
i
had
walked
far
and
the
way
back
was
very
long
i
had
been
parted
from
her
for
three
hours
by
the
time
i
opened
the
door
of
the
little
house
where
we
lodged
the
house
was
dark
and
very
still
i
slipped
off
my
shoes
and
crept
up
the
narrow
stairs
and
opened
the
door
of
our
room
quite
softly
perhaps
she
would
have
cried
herself
to
sleep
and
i
would
lean
over
her
and
waken
her
with
my
kisses
and
beg
her
to
forgive
me
yes
it
had
come
to
that
now
i
went
into
the
room
i
went
towards
the
bed
she
was
not
there
she
was
not
in
the
room
as
one
glance
showed
me
she
was
not
in
the
house
as
i
knew
in
two
minutes
when
i
had
wasted
a
priceless
hour
in
searching
the
town
for
her
i
found
a
note
on
the
make
the
best
of
what
is
left
of
your
life
i
will
spoil
it
no
more
she
was
gone
utterly
gone
i
rushed
to
town
by
the
earliest
morning
train
only
to
find
that
her
people
knew
nothing
of
her
advertisement
failed
only
a
tramp
said
he
had
met
a
white
lady
on
the
cliff
and
a
fisherman
brought
me
a
handkerchief
marked
with
her
name
that
he
had
found
on
the
beach
i
searched
the
country
far
and
wide
but
i
had
to
go
back
to
london
at
last
and
the
months
went
by
i
wo
say
much
about
those
months
because
even
the
memory
of
that
suffering
turns
me
faint
and
sick
at
heart
the
police
and
detectives
and
the
press
failed
me
utterly
her
friends
could
not
help
me
and
were
moreover
wildly
indignant
with
me
especially
her
brother
now
living
very
happily
with
my
first
love
i
do
know
how
i
got
through
those
long
weeks
and
months
i
tried
to
write
i
tried
to
read
i
tried
to
live
the
life
of
a
reasonable
human
being
but
it
was
impossible
i
could
not
endure
the
companionship
of
my
kind
day
and
night
i
almost
saw
her
face
almost
heard
her
voice
i
took
long
walks
in
the
country
and
her
figure
was
always
just
round
the
next
turn
of
the
road
in
the
next
glade
of
the
wood
but
i
never
quite
saw
her
never
quite
heard
her
i
believe
i
was
not
altogether
sane
at
that
time
at
last
one
morning
as
i
was
setting
out
for
one
of
those
long
walks
that
had
no
goal
but
weariness
i
met
a
telegraph
boy
and
took
the
red
envelope
from
his
hand
on
the
pink
paper
inside
was
written
come
to
me
at
once
i
am
dying
you
must
apinshaw
farm
mellor
derbyshire
there
was
a
train
at
twelve
to
marple
the
nearest
station
i
took
it
i
tell
you
there
are
some
things
that
can
not
be
written
about
my
life
for
those
long
months
was
one
of
them
that
journey
was
another
what
had
her
life
been
for
those
months
that
question
troubled
me
as
one
is
troubled
in
every
nerve
at
the
sight
of
a
surgical
operation
or
a
wound
inflicted
on
a
being
dear
to
one
but
the
overmastering
sensation
was
joy
intense
unspeakable
joy
she
was
alive
i
should
see
her
again
i
took
out
the
telegram
and
looked
at
it
i
am
dying
i
simply
did
not
believe
it
she
could
not
die
till
she
had
seen
me
and
if
she
had
lived
all
those
months
without
me
she
could
live
now
when
i
was
with
her
again
when
she
knew
of
the
hell
i
had
endured
apart
from
her
and
the
heaven
of
our
meeting
she
must
live
i
would
not
let
her
die
there
was
a
long
drive
over
bleak
hills
dark
jolting
infinitely
wearisome
at
last
we
stopped
before
a
long
low
building
where
one
or
two
lights
gleamed
faintly
i
sprang
out
the
door
opened
a
blaze
of
light
made
me
blink
and
draw
back
a
woman
was
standing
in
the
doorway
art
thee
arthur
marsh
she
said
yes
then
ower
late
she
dead
ii
i
went
into
the
house
walked
to
the
fire
and
held
out
my
hands
to
it
mechanically
for
though
the
night
was
may
i
was
cold
to
the
bone
there
were
some
folks
standing
round
the
fire
and
lights
flickering
then
an
old
woman
came
forward
with
the
northern
instinct
of
hospitality
tired
she
said
and
have
a
sup
o
tea
i
burst
out
laughing
it
was
too
funny
i
had
travelled
two
hundred
miles
to
see
and
she
was
dead
and
they
offered
me
tea
they
drew
back
from
me
as
if
i
had
been
a
wild
beast
but
i
could
not
stop
laughing
then
a
hand
was
laid
on
my
shoulder
and
some
one
led
me
into
a
dark
room
lighted
a
lamp
set
me
in
a
chair
and
sat
down
opposite
me
it
was
a
bare
parlour
coldly
furnished
with
rush
chairs
and
tables
and
presses
i
caught
my
breath
and
grew
suddenly
grave
and
looked
at
the
woman
who
sat
opposite
me
i
was
miss
ida
nurse
said
she
and
she
told
me
to
send
for
you
who
are
you
her
husband
the
woman
looked
at
me
with
hard
eyes
where
intense
surprise
struggled
with
resentment
then
may
god
forgive
you
she
said
what
done
i
do
know
but
it
be
work
forgivin
even
for
tell
me
i
said
my
wife
tell
you
the
bitter
contempt
in
the
woman
tone
did
not
hurt
me

was
it
to
the
that
had
gnawed
my
heart
all
these
months
tell
you

that
ashamed
of
you
she
never
so

stamped

foot
as
she
passed
me
i
stood
quite
still
i
bit
my
lip
till
i
tasted
the
blood
hot
and
salt
on
my
tongue
she
was
nothing

cried
the
woman
walking
faster
up
and
down
between
the
rush
chairs
and
the
table

an
eye

and
impotent
rage

and
looked
at

and

be
left
alone
with
her
she
hesitated
then
said
in
a
voice
only
a
shade
less
hard
well
come
along
then
we
moved
towards
the
door
as
she
opened
it
a
faint
weak
cry
fell
on
my
ear
my
heart
stood
still
what
that
i
asked
stopping
on
the
threshold
your
child
she
said
shortly
that
too
oh
my
love
oh
my
poor
love
all
these
long
months
she
allus
said
she
send
for
you
when
she
got
over
her
trouble
the
woman
said
as
we
climbed
the
stairs
like
him
to
see
his
little
baby
nurse
she
says
little
baby
it
be
all
right
when
the
baby
born
she
says
know
he
come
to
me
then
you
see
and
i
never
said
nothin
not
thinkin
you
come
if
she
was
your
leavins
and
not
dreamin
as
you
could
be
husband
an
could
stay
away
from
a
hour
her
bein
as
she
was
hush
she
drew
a
key
from
her
pocket
and
fitted
it
to
the
lock
she
opened
the
door
and
i
followed
her
in
it
was
a
large
dark
room
full
of
furniture
there
were
wax
candles
in
brass
candlesticks
and
a
smell
of
lavender
the
big
bed
was
covered
with
white
my
lamb
my
poor
pretty
lamb
said
the
woman
beginning
to
cry
for
the
first
time
as
she
drew
back
the
sheet
do
she
look
beautiful
i
stood
by
the
bedside
i
looked
down
on
my
wife
face
just
so
i
had
seen
it
lie
on
the
pillow
beside
me
in
the
early
morning
when
the
wind
and
the
dawn
came
up
from
beyond
the
sea
she
did
not
look
like
one
dead
her
lips
were
still
red
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
tinge
of
colour
lay
on
her
cheek
it
seemed
to
me
too
that
if
i
kissed
her
she
would
wake
and
put
her
slight
hand
on
my
neck
and
lay
her
cheek
against
mine
and
that
we
should
tell
each
other
everything
and
weep
together
and
understand
and
be
comforted
so
i
stooped
and
laid
my
lips
to
hers
as
the
old
nurse
stole
from
the
room
but
the
red
lips
were
like
marble
and
she
did
not
wake
she
will
not
wake
now
ever
any
more
i
tell
you
again
there
are
some
things
that
can
not
be
written
iii
i
lay
that
night
in
a
big
room
filled
with
heavy
dark
furniture
in
a
great
hung
with
heavy
dark
curtains
a
bed
the
counterpart
of
that
other
bed
from
whose
side
they
had
dragged
me
at
last
they
fed
me
i
believe
and
the
old
nurse
was
kind
to
me
i
think
she
saw
now
that
it
is
not
the
dead
who
are
to
be
pitied
most
i
lay
at
last
in
the
big
roomy
bed
and
heard
the
household
noises
grow
fewer
and
die
out
the
little
wail
of
my
child
sounding
latest
they
had
brought
the
child
to
me
and
i
had
held
it
in
my
arms
and
bowed
my
head
over
its
tiny
face
and
frail
fingers
i
did
not
love
it
then
i
told
myself
it
had
cost
me
her
life
but
my
heart
told
me
that
it
was
i
who
had
done
that
the
tall
clock
at
the
stairhead
sounded
the
hours
eleven
twelve
one
and
still
i
could
not
sleep
the
room
was
dark
and
very
still
i
had
not
been
able
to
look
at
my
life
quietly
i
had
been
full
of
the
intoxication
of
grief
a
real
drunkenness
more
merciful
than
the
calm
that
comes
after
now
i
lay
still
as
the
dead
woman
in
the
next
room
and
looked
at
what
was
left
of
my
life
i
lay
still
and
thought
and
thought
and
thought
and
in
those
hours
i
tasted
the
bitterness
of
death
it
must
have
been
about
two
that
i
first
became
aware
of
a
slight
sound
that
was
not
the
ticking
of
the
clock
i
say
i
first
became
aware
and
yet
i
knew
perfectly
that
i
had
heard
that
sound
more
than
once
before
and
had
yet
determined
not
to
hear
it
it
came
from
the
next
the
room
where
the
corpse
lay
and
i
did
not
wish
to
hear
that
sound
because
i
knew
it
meant
that
i
was
nervous
miserably
nervous
a
coward
and
a
brute
it
meant
that
i
having
killed
my
wife
as
surely
as
though
i
had
put
a
knife
in
her
breast
had
now
sunk
so
low
as
to
be
afraid
of
her
dead
body
the
dead
body
that
lay
in
the
room
next
to
mine
the
heads
of
the
beds
were
placed
against
the
same
wall
and
from
that
wall
i
had
fancied
i
heard
slight
slight
almost
inaudible
sounds
so
when
i
say
that
i
became
aware
of
them
i
mean
that
i
at
last
heard
a
sound
so
distinct
as
to
leave
no
room
for
doubt
or
question
it
brought
me
to
a
sitting
position
in
the
bed
and
the
drops
of
sweat
gathered
heavily
on
my
forehead
and
fell
on
my
cold
hands
as
i
held
my
breath
and
listened
i
do
know
how
long
i
sat
there
there
was
no
further
sound
and
at
last
my
tense
muscles
relaxed
and
i
fell
back
on
the
pillow
you
fool
i
said
to
myself
dead
or
alive
is
she
not
your
darling
your
heart
heart
would
you
not
go
near
to
die
of
joy
if
she
came
to
you
pray
god
to
let
her
spirit
come
back
and
tell
you
she
forgives
you
i
wish
she
would
come
myself
answered
in
words
while
every
fibre
of
my
body
and
mind
shrank
and
quivered
in
denial
i
struck
a
match
lighted
a
candle
and
breathed
more
freely
as
i
looked
at
the
polished
furniture
the
commonplace
details
of
an
ordinary
room
then
i
thought
of
her
lying
alone
so
near
me
so
quiet
under
the
white
sheet
she
was
dead
she
would
not
wake
or
move
but
suppose
she
did
move
suppose
she
turned
back
the
sheet
and
got
up
and
walked
across
the
floor
and
turned
the
as
i
thought
it
i
heard
plainly
unmistakably
heard
the
door
of
the
chamber
of
death
open
slowly
i
heard
slow
steps
in
the
passage
slow
heavy
steps
i
heard
the
touch
of
hands
on
my
door
outside
uncertain
hands
that
felt
for
the
latch
sick
with
terror
i
lay
clenching
the
sheet
in
my
hands
i
knew
well
enough
what
would
come
in
when
that
door
opened
that
door
on
which
my
eyes
were
fixed
i
dreaded
to
look
yet
i
dared
not
turn
away
my
eyes
the
door
opened
slowly
slowly
slowly
and
the
figure
of
my
dead
wife
came
in
it
came
straight
towards
the
bed
and
stood
at
the
in
its
white
with
the
white
bandage
under
its
chin
there
was
a
scent
of
lavender
its
eyes
were
wide
open
and
looked
at
me
with
love
unspeakable
i
could
have
shrieked
aloud
my
wife
spoke
it
was
the
same
dear
voice
that
i
had
loved
so
to
hear
but
it
was
very
weak
and
faint
now
and
now
i
trembled
as
i
listened
you
are
afraid
of
me
darling
are
you
though
i
am
dead
i
heard
all
you
said
to
me
when
you
came
but
i
could
answer
but
now
come
back
from
the
dead
to
tell
you
i
was
really
so
bad
as
you
thought
me
elvire
had
told
me
she
loved
oscar
i
only
wrote
the
letter
to
make
it
easier
for
you
i
was
too
proud
to
tell
you
when
you
were
so
angry
but
i
am
not
proud
any
more
now
you
love
me
again
now
you
now
i
dead
one
always
forgives
dead
people
the
poor
ghost
voice
was
hollow
and
faint
abject
terror
paralyzed
me
i
could
answer
nothing
say
you
forgive
me
the
thin
monotonous
voice
went
on
say
you
love
me
again
i
had
to
speak
coward
as
i
was
i
did
manage
to
stammer
yes
i
love
you
i
have
always
loved
you
god
help
me
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
reassured
me
and
i
ended
more
firmly
than
i
began
the
figure
by
the
bed
swayed
a
little
unsteadily
i
suppose
she
said
wearily
you
would
be
afraid
now
i
am
dead
if
i
came
round
to
you
and
kissed
you
she
made
a
movement
as
though
she
would
have
come
to
me
then
i
did
shriek
aloud
again
and
again
and
covered
my
face
with
the
sheet
and
wound
it
round
my
head
and
body
and
held
it
with
all
my
force
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
i
heard
my
door
close
and
then
a
sound
of
feet
and
of
voices
and
i
heard
something
heavy
fall
i
disentangled
my
head
from
the
sheet
my
room
was
empty
then
reason
came
back
to
me
i
leaped
from
the
bed
ida
my
darling
come
back
i
am
not
afraid
i
love
you
come
back
come
back
i
sprang
to
my
door
and
flung
it
open
some
one
was
bringing
a
light
along
the
passage
on
the
floor
outside
the
door
of
the
was
a
huddled
heap
the
corpse
in
its
dead
dead
dead
she
is
buried
in
mellor
churchyard
and
there
is
no
stone
over
her
now
whether
it
was
catalepsy
as
the
doctors
said
or
whether
my
love
came
back
even
from
the
dead
to
me
who
loved
her
i
shall
never
know
but
this
i
know
that
if
i
had
held
out
my
arms
to
her
as
she
stood
at
my
if
i
had
said
yes
even
from
the
grave
my
darling
from
hell
itself
come
back
come
back
to
me
if
i
had
had
room
in
my
coward
heart
for
anything
but
the
unreasoning
terror
that
killed
love
in
that
hour
i
should
not
now
be
here
alone
i
shrank
from
her
i
feared
her
i
would
not
take
her
to
my
heart
and
now
she
will
not
come
to
me
any
more
why
do
i
go
on
living
you
see
there
is
the
child
it
is
four
years
old
now
and
it
has
never
spoken
and
never
smiled
in
although
every
word
of
this
story
is
as
true
as
despair
i
do
not
expect
people
to
believe
it
nowadays
a
rational
explanation
is
required
before
belief
is
possible
let
me
then
at
once
offer
the
rational
explanation
which
finds
most
favour
among
those
who
have
heard
the
tale
of
my
life
tragedy
it
is
held
that
we
were
under
a
delusion
laura
and
i
on
that
of
october
and
that
this
supposition
places
the
whole
matter
on
a
satisfactory
and
believable
basis
the
reader
can
judge
when
he
too
has
heard
my
story
how
far
this
is
an
explanation
and
in
what
sense
it
is
rational
there
were
three
who
took
part
in
this
laura
and
i
and
another
man
the
other
man
still
lives
and
can
speak
to
the
truth
of
the
least
credible
part
of
my
story
i
never
in
my
life
knew
what
it
was
to
have
as
much
money
as
i
required
to
supply
the
most
ordinary
needs
good
colours
books
and
and
when
we
were
married
we
knew
quite
well
that
we
should
only
be
able
to
live
at
all
by
strict
punctuality
and
attention
to
business
i
used
to
paint
in
those
days
and
laura
used
to
write
and
we
felt
sure
we
could
keep
the
pot
at
least
simmering
living
in
town
was
out
of
the
question
so
we
went
to
look
for
a
cottage
in
the
country
which
should
be
at
once
sanitary
and
picturesque
so
rarely
do
these
two
qualities
meet
in
one
cottage
that
our
search
was
for
some
time
quite
fruitless
we
tried
advertisements
but
most
of
the
desirable
rural
residences
which
we
did
look
at
proved
to
be
lacking
in
both
essentials
and
when
a
cottage
chanced
to
have
drains
it
always
had
stucco
as
well
and
was
shaped
like
a
and
if
we
found
a
vine
or
porch
corruption
invariably
lurked
within
our
minds
got
so
befogged
by
the
eloquence
of
and
the
rival
disadvantages
of
the
and
outrages
to
beauty
which
we
had
seen
and
scorned
that
i
very
much
doubt
whether
either
of
us
on
our
wedding
morning
knew
the
difference
between
a
house
and
a
haystack
but
when
we
got
away
from
friends
and
on
our
honeymoon
our
wits
grew
clear
again
and
we
knew
a
pretty
cottage
when
at
last
we
saw
one
it
was
at
brenzett
a
little
village
set
on
a
hill
over
against
the
southern
marshes
we
had
gone
there
from
the
seaside
village
where
we
were
staying
to
see
the
church
and
two
fields
from
the
church
we
found
this
cottage
it
stood
quite
by
itself
about
two
miles
from
the
village
it
was
a
long
low
building
with
rooms
sticking
out
in
unexpected
places
there
was
a
bit
of
and
just
two
old
rooms
all
that
was
left
of
a
big
house
that
had
once
stood
there
and
round
this
the
house
had
grown
up
stripped
of
its
roses
and
jasmine
it
would
have
been
hideous
as
it
stood
it
was
charming
and
after
a
brief
examination
we
took
it
it
was
absurdly
cheap
the
rest
of
our
honeymoon
we
spent
in
grubbing
about
in
shops
in
the
county
town
picking
up
bits
of
old
oak
and
chippendale
chairs
for
our
furnishing
we
wound
up
with
a
run
up
to
town
and
a
visit
to
liberty
and
soon
the
low
rooms
began
to
be
home
there
was
a
jolly
garden
with
grass
paths
and
no
end
of
hollyhocks
and
sunflowers
and
big
lilies
from
the
window
you
could
see
the
and
beyond
them
the
blue
thin
line
of
the
sea
we
were
as
happy
as
the
summer
was
glorious
and
settled
down
into
work
sooner
than
we
ourselves
expected
i
was
never
tired
of
sketching
the
view
and
the
wonderful
cloud
effects
from
the
open
lattice
and
laura
would
sit
at
the
table
and
write
verses
about
them
in
which
i
mostly
played
the
part
of
foreground
we
got
a
tall
old
peasant
woman
to
do
for
us
her
face
and
figure
were
good
though
her
cooking
was
of
the
homeliest
but
she
understood
all
about
gardening
and
told
us
all
the
old
names
of
the
coppices
and
cornfields
and
the
stories
of
the
smugglers
and
highwaymen
and
better
still
of
the
things
that
walked
and
of
the
sights
which
met
one
in
lonely
glens
of
a
starlight
night
she
was
a
great
comfort
to
us
because
laura
hated
housekeeping
as
much
as
i
loved
folklore
and
we
soon
came
to
leave
all
the
domestic
business
to
dorman
and
to
use
her
legends
in
little
magazine
stories
which
brought
in
the
jingling
guinea
we
had
three
months
of
married
happiness
and
did
not
have
a
single
quarrel
one
october
evening
i
had
been
down
to
smoke
a
pipe
with
the
doctor
our
only
neighbour
a
pleasant
young
irishman
laura
had
stayed
at
home
to
finish
a
comic
sketch
of
a
village
episode
for
the
i
left
her
laughing
over
her
own
jokes
and
came
in
to
find
her
a
crumpled
heap
of
pale
muslin
weeping
on
the
window
seat
good
heavens
my
darling
what
the
matter
i
cried
taking
her
in
my
arms
she
leaned
her
little
dark
head
against
my
shoulder
and
went
on
crying
i
had
never
seen
her
cry
before
we
had
always
been
so
happy
you
see
and
i
felt
sure
some
frightful
misfortune
had
happened
what
the
matter
do
speak
it
dorman
she
sobbed
what
has
she
done
i
inquired
immensely
relieved
she
says
she
must
go
before
the
end
of
the
month
and
she
says
her
niece
is
ill
she
gone
down
to
see
her
now
but
i
do
believe
the
reason
because
her
niece
is
always
ill
i
believe
some
one
has
been
setting
her
against
us
her
manner
was
so
queer
never
mind
pussy
i
said
whatever
you
do
do
cry
or
i
shall
have
to
cry
too
to
keep
you
in
countenance
and
then
you
never
respect
your
man
again
she
dried
her
eyes
obediently
on
my
handkerchief
and
even
smiled
faintly
but
you
see
she
went
on
it
is
really
serious
because
these
village
people
are
so
sheepy
and
if
one
wo
do
a
thing
you
may
be
quite
sure
none
of
the
others
will
and
i
shall
have
to
cook
the
dinners
and
wash
up
the
hateful
greasy
plates
and
you
have
to
carry
cans
of
water
about
and
clean
the
boots
and
knives
and
we
shall
never
have
any
time
for
work
or
earn
any
money
or
anything
we
shall
have
to
work
all
day
and
only
be
able
to
rest
when
we
are
waiting
for
the
kettle
to
boil
i
represented
to
her
that
even
if
we
had
to
perform
these
duties
the
day
would
still
present
some
margin
for
other
toils
and
recreations
but
she
refused
to
see
the
matter
in
any
but
the
greyest
light
she
was
very
unreasonable
my
laura
but
i
could
not
have
loved
her
any
more
if
she
had
been
as
reasonable
as
whately
i
speak
to
dorman
when
she
comes
back
and
see
if
i
ca
come
to
terms
with
her
i
said
perhaps
she
wants
a
rise
in
her
screw
it
will
be
all
right
let
walk
up
to
the
church
the
church
was
a
large
and
lonely
one
and
we
loved
to
go
there
especially
upon
bright
nights
the
path
skirted
a
wood
cut
through
it
once
and
ran
along
the
crest
of
the
hill
through
two
meadows
and
round
the
churchyard
wall
over
which
the
old
yews
loomed
in
black
masses
of
shadow
this
path
which
was
partly
paved
was
called
the
for
it
had
long
been
the
way
by
which
the
corpses
had
been
carried
to
burial
the
churchyard
was
richly
treed
and
was
shaded
by
great
elms
which
stood
just
outside
and
stretched
their
majestic
arms
in
benediction
over
the
happy
dead
a
large
low
porch
let
one
into
the
building
by
a
norman
doorway
and
a
heavy
oak
door
studded
with
iron
inside
the
arches
rose
into
darkness
and
between
them
the
reticulated
windows
which
stood
out
white
in
the
moonlight
in
the
chancel
the
windows
were
of
rich
glass
which
showed
in
faint
light
their
noble
colouring
and
made
the
black
oak
of
the
choir
pews
hardly
more
solid
than
the
shadows
but
on
each
side
of
the
altar
lay
a
grey
marble
figure
of
a
knight
in
full
plate
armour
lying
upon
a
low
slab
with
hands
held
up
in
everlasting
prayer
and
these
figures
oddly
enough
were
always
to
be
seen
if
there
was
any
glimmer
of
light
in
the
church
their
names
were
lost
but
the
peasants
told
of
them
that
they
had
been
fierce
and
wicked
men
marauders
by
land
and
sea
who
had
been
the
scourge
of
their
time
and
had
been
guilty
of
deeds
so
foul
that
the
house
they
had
lived
in
the
big
house
by
the
way
that
had
stood
on
the
site
of
our
cottage
had
been
stricken
by
lightning
and
the
vengeance
of
heaven
but
for
all
that
the
gold
of
their
heirs
had
bought
them
a
place
in
the
church
looking
at
the
bad
hard
faces
reproduced
in
the
marble
this
story
was
easily
believed
the
church
looked
at
its
best
and
weirdest
on
that
night
for
the
shadows
of
the
yew
trees
fell
through
the
windows
upon
the
floor
of
the
nave
and
touched
the
pillars
with
tattered
shade
we
sat
down
together
without
speaking
and
watched
the
solemn
beauty
of
the
old
church
with
some
of
that
awe
which
inspired
its
early
builders
we
walked
to
the
chancel
and
looked
at
the
sleeping
warriors
then
we
rested
some
time
on
the
stone
seat
in
the
porch
looking
out
over
the
stretch
of
quiet
moonlit
meadows
feeling
in
every
fibre
of
our
being
the
peace
of
the
night
and
of
our
happy
love
and
came
away
at
last
with
a
sense
that
even
scrubbing
and
blackleading
were
but
small
troubles
at
their
worst
dorman
had
come
back
from
the
village
and
i
at
once
invited
her
to
a
now
dorman
i
said
when
i
had
got
her
into
my
painting
room
what
all
this
about
your
not
staying
with
us
i
should
be
glad
to
get
away
sir
before
the
end
of
the
month
she
answered
with
her
usual
placid
dignity
have
you
any
fault
to
find
mrs
dorman
none
at
all
sir
you
and
your
lady
have
always
been
most
kind
sure
well
what
is
it
are
your
wages
not
high
enough
no
sir
i
gets
quite
enough
then
why
not
stay
i
rather
not
with
some
hesitation
my
niece
is
but
your
niece
has
been
ill
ever
since
we
came
no
answer
there
was
a
long
and
awkward
silence
i
broke
it
ca
you
stay
for
another
month
i
asked
no
sir
i
bound
to
go
by
thursday
and
this
was
monday
well
i
must
say
i
think
you
might
have
let
us
know
before
there
no
time
now
to
get
any
one
else
and
your
mistress
is
not
fit
to
do
heavy
housework
ca
you
stay
till
next
week
i
might
be
able
to
come
back
next
week
i
was
now
convinced
that
all
she
wanted
was
a
brief
holiday
which
we
should
have
been
willing
enough
to
let
her
have
as
soon
as
we
could
get
a
substitute
but
why
must
you
go
this
week
i
persisted
come
out
with
it
dorman
drew
the
little
shawl
which
she
always
wore
tightly
across
her
bosom
as
though
she
were
cold
then
she
said
with
a
sort
of
effort
they
say
sir
as
this
was
a
big
house
in
catholic
times
and
there
was
a
many
deeds
done
here
the
nature
of
the
deeds
might
be
vaguely
inferred
from
the
inflection
of
dorman
voice
which
was
enough
to
make
one
blood
run
cold
i
was
glad
that
laura
was
not
in
the
room
she
was
always
nervous
as
natures
are
and
i
felt
that
these
tales
about
our
house
told
by
this
old
peasant
woman
with
her
impressive
manner
and
contagious
credulity
might
have
made
our
home
less
dear
to
my
wife
tell
me
all
about
it
dorman
i
said
you
need
mind
about
telling
me
i
not
like
the
young
people
who
make
fun
of
such
things
which
was
partly
true
well
sir
she
sank
her
voice
you
may
have
seen
in
the
church
beside
the
altar
two
shapes
you
mean
the
effigies
of
the
knights
in
armour
i
said
cheerfully
i
mean
them
two
bodies
drawed
out
in
marble
she
returned
and
i
had
to
admit
that
her
description
was
a
thousand
times
more
graphic
than
mine
to
say
nothing
of
a
certain
weird
force
and
uncanniness
about
the
phrase
drawed
out
in
marble
they
do
say
as
on
all
saints
eve
them
two
bodies
sits
up
on
their
slabs
and
gets
off
of
them
and
then
walks
down
the
aisle
their
marble
another
good
phrase
dorman
and
as
the
church
clock
strikes
eleven
they
walks
out
of
the
church
door
and
over
the
graves
and
along
the
and
if
it
a
wet
night
there
the
marks
of
their
feet
in
the
morning
and
where
do
they
go
i
asked
rather
fascinated
they
comes
back
here
to
their
home
sir
and
if
any
one
meets
them
well
what
then
i
asked
but
no
not
another
word
could
i
get
from
her
save
that
her
niece
was
ill
and
she
must
go
after
what
i
had
heard
i
scorned
to
discuss
the
niece
and
tried
to
get
from
dorman
more
details
of
the
legend
i
could
get
nothing
but
warnings
whatever
you
do
sir
lock
the
door
early
on
all
saints
eve
and
make
the
over
the
doorstep
and
on
the
windows
but
has
any
one
ever
seen
these
things
i
persisted
that
not
for
me
to
say
i
know
what
i
know
sir
well
who
was
here
last
year
no
one
sir
the
lady
as
owned
the
house
only
stayed
here
in
summer
and
she
always
went
to
london
a
full
month
afore
night
and
sorry
to
inconvenience
you
and
your
lady
but
my
niece
is
ill
and
i
must
go
on
thursday
i
could
have
shaken
her
for
her
absurd
reiteration
of
that
obvious
fiction
after
she
had
told
me
her
real
reasons
she
was
determined
to
go
nor
could
our
united
entreaties
move
her
in
the
least
i
did
not
tell
laura
the
legend
of
the
shapes
that
walked
in
their
marble
partly
because
a
legend
concerning
our
house
might
perhaps
trouble
my
wife
and
partly
i
think
from
some
more
occult
reason
this
was
not
quite
the
same
to
me
as
any
other
story
and
i
did
not
want
to
talk
about
it
till
the
day
was
over
i
had
very
soon
ceased
to
think
of
the
legend
however
i
was
painting
a
portrait
of
laura
against
the
lattice
window
and
i
could
not
think
of
much
else
i
had
got
a
splendid
background
of
yellow
and
grey
sunset
and
was
working
away
with
enthusiasm
at
her
face
on
thursday
dorman
went
she
relented
at
parting
so
far
as
to
say
do
you
put
yourself
about
too
much
and
if
there
any
little
thing
i
can
do
next
week
i
sure
i
sha
mind
from
which
i
inferred
that
she
wished
to
come
back
to
us
after
halloween
up
to
the
last
she
adhered
to
the
fiction
of
the
niece
with
touching
fidelity
thursday
passed
off
pretty
well
laura
showed
marked
ability
in
the
matter
of
steak
and
potatoes
and
i
confess
that
my
knives
and
the
plates
which
i
insisted
upon
washing
were
better
done
than
i
had
dared
to
expect
friday
came
it
is
about
what
happened
on
that
friday
that
this
is
written
i
wonder
if
i
should
have
believed
it
if
any
one
had
told
it
to
me
i
will
write
the
story
of
it
as
quickly
and
plainly
as
i
can
everything
that
happened
on
that
day
is
burnt
into
my
brain
i
shall
not
forget
anything
nor
leave
anything
out
i
got
up
early
i
remember
and
lighted
the
kitchen
fire
and
had
just
achieved
a
smoky
success
when
my
little
wife
came
running
down
as
sunny
and
sweet
as
the
clear
october
morning
itself
we
prepared
breakfast
together
and
found
it
very
good
fun
the
housework
was
soon
done
and
when
brushes
and
brooms
and
pails
were
quiet
again
the
house
was
still
indeed
it
is
wonderful
what
a
difference
one
makes
in
a
house
we
really
missed
dorman
quite
apart
from
considerations
concerning
pots
and
pans
we
spent
the
day
in
dusting
our
books
and
putting
them
straight
and
dined
gaily
on
cold
steak
and
coffee
laura
was
if
possible
brighter
and
gayer
and
sweeter
than
usual
and
i
began
to
think
that
a
little
domestic
toil
was
really
good
for
her
we
had
never
been
so
merry
since
we
were
married
and
the
walk
we
had
that
afternoon
was
i
think
the
happiest
time
of
all
my
life
when
we
had
watched
the
deep
scarlet
clouds
slowly
pale
into
leaden
grey
against
a
sky
and
saw
the
white
mists
curl
up
along
the
hedgerows
in
the
distant
marsh
we
came
back
to
the
house
silently
hand
in
hand
you
are
sad
my
darling
i
said
as
we
sat
down
together
in
our
little
parlour
i
expected
a
disclaimer
for
my
own
silence
had
been
the
silence
of
complete
happiness
to
my
surprise
she
said
yes
i
think
i
am
sad
or
rather
i
am
uneasy
i
do
think
i
very
well
i
have
shivered
three
or
four
times
since
we
came
in
and
it
is
not
cold
is
it
no
i
said
and
hoped
it
was
not
a
chill
caught
from
the
treacherous
mists
that
roll
up
from
the
marshes
in
the
dying
light
no
she
said
she
did
not
think
so
then
after
a
silence
she
spoke
suddenly
do
you
ever
have
presentiments
of
evil
no
i
said
smiling
and
i
should
believe
in
them
if
i
had
i
do
she
went
on
the
night
my
father
died
i
knew
it
though
he
was
right
away
in
the
north
of
scotland
i
did
not
answer
in
words
she
sat
looking
at
the
fire
for
some
time
in
silence
gently
stroking
my
hand
at
last
she
sprang
up
came
behind
me
and
drawing
my
head
back
kissed
me
there
it
over
now
she
said
what
a
baby
i
am
come
light
the
candles
and
we
have
some
of
these
new
rubinstein
duets
and
we
spent
a
happy
hour
or
two
at
the
piano
at
about
ten
i
began
to
long
for
the
pipe
but
laura
looked
so
white
that
i
felt
it
would
be
brutal
of
me
to
fill
our
with
the
fumes
of
strong
cavendish
i
take
my
pipe
outside
i
said
let
me
come
too
no
sweetheart
not
you
much
too
tired
i
sha
be
long
get
to
bed
or
i
shall
have
an
invalid
to
nurse
as
well
as
the
boots
to
clean
i
kissed
her
and
was
turning
to
go
when
she
flung
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
held
me
as
if
she
would
never
let
me
go
again
i
stroked
her
hair
come
pussy
you
the
housework
has
been
too
much
for
you
she
loosened
her
clasp
a
little
and
drew
a
deep
breath
no
we
been
very
happy
jack
have
we
do
stay
out
too
long
i
wo
my
dearie
i
strolled
out
of
the
front
door
leaving
it
unlatched
what
a
night
it
was
the
jagged
masses
of
heavy
dark
cloud
were
rolling
at
intervals
from
horizon
to
horizon
and
thin
white
wreaths
covered
the
stars
through
all
the
rush
of
the
cloud
river
the
moon
swam
breasting
the
waves
and
disappearing
again
in
the
darkness
when
now
and
again
her
light
reached
the
woodlands
they
seemed
to
be
slowly
and
noiselessly
waving
in
time
to
the
swing
of
the
clouds
above
them
there
was
a
strange
grey
light
over
all
the
earth
the
fields
had
that
shadowy
bloom
over
them
which
only
comes
from
the
marriage
of
dew
and
moonshine
or
frost
and
starlight
i
walked
up
and
down
drinking
in
the
beauty
of
the
quiet
earth
and
the
changing
sky
the
night
was
absolutely
silent
nothing
seemed
to
be
abroad
there
was
no
skurrying
of
rabbits
or
twitter
of
the
birds
and
though
the
clouds
went
sailing
across
the
sky
the
wind
that
drove
them
never
came
low
enough
to
rustle
the
dead
leaves
in
the
woodland
paths
across
the
meadows
i
could
see
the
church
tower
standing
out
black
and
grey
against
the
sky
i
walked
there
thinking
over
our
three
months
of
happiness
and
of
my
wife
her
dear
eyes
her
loving
ways
oh
my
little
girl
my
own
little
girl
what
a
vision
came
then
of
a
long
glad
life
for
you
and
me
together
i
heard
a
from
the
church
eleven
already
i
turned
to
go
in
but
the
night
held
me
i
could
not
go
back
into
our
little
warm
rooms
yet
i
would
go
up
to
the
church
i
felt
vaguely
that
it
would
be
good
to
carry
my
love
and
thankfulness
to
the
sanctuary
whither
so
many
loads
of
sorrow
and
gladness
had
been
borne
by
the
men
and
women
of
the
dead
years
i
looked
in
at
the
low
window
as
i
went
by
laura
was
half
lying
on
her
chair
in
front
of
the
fire
i
could
not
see
her
face
only
her
little
head
showed
dark
against
the
pale
blue
wall
she
was
quite
still
asleep
no
doubt
my
heart
reached
out
to
her
as
i
went
on
there
must
be
a
god
i
thought
and
a
god
who
was
good
how
otherwise
could
anything
so
sweet
and
dear
as
she
have
ever
been
imagined
i
walked
slowly
along
the
edge
of
the
wood
a
sound
broke
the
stillness
of
the
night
it
was
a
rustling
in
the
wood
i
stopped
and
listened
the
sound
stopped
too
i
went
on
and
now
distinctly
heard
another
step
than
mine
answer
mine
like
an
echo
it
was
a
poacher
or
a
most
likely
for
these
were
not
unknown
in
our
arcadian
neighbourhood
but
whoever
it
was
he
was
a
fool
not
to
step
more
lightly
i
turned
into
the
wood
and
now
the
footstep
seemed
to
come
from
the
path
i
had
just
left
it
must
be
an
echo
i
thought
the
wood
looked
perfect
in
the
moonlight
the
large
dying
ferns
and
the
brushwood
showed
where
through
thinning
foliage
the
pale
light
came
down
the
tree
trunks
stood
up
like
gothic
columns
all
around
me
they
reminded
me
of
the
church
and
i
turned
into
the
and
passed
through
the
between
the
graves
to
the
low
porch
i
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
stone
seat
where
laura
and
i
had
watched
the
fading
landscape
then
i
noticed
that
the
door
of
the
church
was
open
and
i
blamed
myself
for
having
left
it
unlatched
the
other
night
we
were
the
only
people
who
ever
cared
to
come
to
the
church
except
on
sundays
and
i
was
vexed
to
think
that
through
our
carelessness
the
damp
autumn
airs
had
had
a
chance
of
getting
in
and
injuring
the
old
fabric
i
went
in
it
will
seem
strange
perhaps
that
i
should
have
gone
up
the
aisle
before
i
remembered
with
a
sudden
chill
followed
by
as
sudden
a
rush
of
that
this
was
the
very
day
and
hour
when
according
to
tradition
the
shapes
drawed
out
in
marble
began
to
walk
having
thus
remembered
the
legend
and
remembered
it
with
a
shiver
of
which
i
was
ashamed
i
could
not
do
otherwise
than
walk
up
towards
the
altar
just
to
look
at
the
figures
as
i
said
to
myself
really
what
i
wanted
was
to
assure
myself
first
that
i
did
not
believe
the
legend
and
secondly
that
it
was
not
true
i
was
rather
glad
that
i
had
come
i
thought
now
i
could
tell
dorman
how
vain
her
fancies
were
and
how
peacefully
the
marble
figures
slept
on
through
the
ghastly
hour
with
my
hands
in
my
pockets
i
passed
up
the
aisle
in
the
grey
dim
light
the
eastern
end
of
the
church
looked
larger
than
usual
and
the
arches
above
the
two
tombs
looked
larger
too
the
moon
came
out
and
showed
me
the
reason
i
stopped
short
my
heart
gave
a
leap
that
nearly
choked
me
and
then
sank
sickeningly
the
bodies
drawed
out
and
their
marble
slabs
lay
wide
and
bare
in
the
vague
moonlight
that
slanted
through
the
east
window
were
they
really
gone
or
was
i
mad
clenching
my
nerves
i
stooped
and
passed
my
hand
over
the
smooth
slabs
and
felt
their
flat
unbroken
surface
had
some
one
taken
the
things
away
was
it
some
vile
practical
joke
i
would
make
sure
anyway
in
an
instant
i
had
made
a
torch
of
a
newspaper
which
happened
to
be
in
my
pocket
and
lighting
it
held
it
high
above
my
head
its
yellow
glare
illumined
the
dark
arches
and
those
slabs
the
figures
gone
and
i
was
alone
in
the
church
or
was
i
alone
and
then
a
horror
seized
me
a
horror
indefinable
and
indescribable
an
overwhelming
certainty
of
supreme
and
accomplished
calamity
i
flung
down
the
torch
and
tore
along
the
aisle
and
out
through
the
porch
biting
my
lips
as
i
ran
to
keep
myself
from
shrieking
aloud
oh
was
i
mad
or
what
was
this
that
possessed
me
i
leaped
the
churchyard
wall
and
took
the
straight
cut
across
the
fields
led
by
the
light
from
our
windows
just
as
i
got
over
the
first
stile
a
dark
figure
seemed
to
spring
out
of
the
ground
mad
still
with
that
certainty
of
misfortune
i
made
for
the
thing
that
stood
in
my
path
shouting
get
out
of
the
way
ca
you
but
my
push
met
with
a
more
vigorous
resistance
than
i
had
expected
my
arms
were
caught
just
above
the
elbow
and
held
as
in
a
vice
and
the
irish
doctor
actually
shook
me
would
ye
he
cried
in
his
own
unmistakable
accents
would
ye
then
let
me
go
you
fool
i
gasped
the
marble
figures
have
gone
from
the
church
i
tell
you
they
gone
he
broke
into
a
ringing
laugh
i
have
to
give
ye
a
draught
i
see
ye
bin
smoking
too
much
and
listening
to
old
tales
i
tell
you
i
seen
the
bare
slabs
well
come
back
with
me
i
going
up
to
old
palmer
his
ill
we
look
in
at
the
church
and
let
me
see
the
bare
slabs
you
go
if
you
like
i
said
a
little
less
frantic
for
his
laughter
i
going
home
to
my
wife
rubbish
man
said
he
d
think
i
permit
of
that
are
ye
to
go
saying
all
yer
life
that
ye
seen
solid
marble
endowed
with
vitality
and
me
to
go
all
me
life
saying
ye
were
a
coward
no
sir
ye
sha
do
ut
the
night
air
a
human
voice
and
i
think
also
the
physical
contact
with
this
six
feet
of
solid
common
sense
brought
me
back
a
little
to
my
ordinary
self
and
the
word
coward
was
a
mental
come
on
then
i
said
sullenly
perhaps
you
right
he
still
held
my
arm
tightly
we
got
over
the
stile
and
back
to
the
church
all
was
still
as
death
the
place
smelt
very
damp
and
earthy
we
walked
up
the
aisle
i
am
not
ashamed
to
confess
that
i
shut
my
eyes
i
knew
the
figures
would
not
be
there
i
heard
kelly
strike
a
match
here
they
are
ye
see
right
enough
ye
been
dreaming
or
drinking
asking
yer
pardon
for
the
imputation
i
opened
my
eyes
by
kelly
expiring
vesta
i
saw
two
shapes
lying
in
their
marble
on
their
slabs
i
drew
a
deep
breath
and
caught
his
hand
i
awfully
indebted
to
you
i
said
it
must
have
been
some
trick
of
light
or
i
have
been
working
rather
hard
perhaps
that
it
do
you
know
i
was
quite
convinced
they
were
gone
i
aware
of
that
he
answered
rather
grimly
ye
have
to
be
careful
of
that
brain
of
yours
my
friend
i
assure
ye
he
was
leaning
over
and
looking
at
the
figure
whose
stony
face
was
the
most
villainous
and
deadly
in
expression
by
jove
he
said
something
has
been
afoot
here
this
hand
is
broken
and
so
it
was
i
was
certain
that
it
had
been
perfect
the
last
time
laura
and
i
had
been
there
perhaps
some
one
has
to
remove
them
said
the
young
doctor
that
wo
account
for
my
impression
i
objected
too
much
painting
and
tobacco
will
account
for
that
well
enough
come
along
i
said
or
my
wife
will
be
getting
anxious
you
come
in
and
have
a
drop
of
whisky
and
drink
confusion
to
ghosts
and
better
sense
to
me
i
ought
to
go
up
to
palmer
but
it
so
late
now
i
best
leave
it
till
the
morning
he
replied
i
was
kept
late
at
the
union
and
had
to
see
a
lot
of
people
since
all
right
i
come
back
with
ye
i
think
he
fancied
i
needed
him
more
than
did
palmer
girl
so
discussing
how
such
an
illusion
could
have
been
possible
and
deducing
from
this
experience
large
generalities
concerning
ghostly
apparitions
we
walked
up
to
our
cottage
we
saw
as
we
walked
up
the
that
bright
light
streamed
out
of
the
front
door
and
presently
saw
that
the
parlour
door
was
open
too
had
she
gone
out
come
in
i
said
and
kelly
followed
me
into
the
parlour
it
was
all
ablaze
with
candles
not
only
the
wax
ones
but
at
least
a
dozen
guttering
glaring
tallow
dips
stuck
in
vases
and
ornaments
in
unlikely
places
light
i
knew
was
laura
remedy
for
nervousness
poor
child
why
had
i
left
her
brute
that
i
was
we
glanced
round
the
room
and
at
first
we
did
not
see
her
the
window
was
open
and
the
draught
set
all
the
candles
flaring
one
way
her
chair
was
empty
and
her
handkerchief
and
book
lay
on
the
floor
i
turned
to
the
window
there
in
the
recess
of
the
window
i
saw
her
oh
my
child
my
love
had
she
gone
to
that
window
to
watch
for
me
and
what
had
come
into
the
room
behind
her
to
what
had
she
turned
with
that
look
of
frantic
fear
and
horror
oh
my
little
one
had
she
thought
that
it
was
i
whose
step
she
heard
and
turned
to
meet
what
she
had
fallen
back
across
a
table
in
the
window
and
her
body
lay
half
on
it
and
half
on
the
and
her
head
hung
down
over
the
table
the
brown
hair
loosened
and
fallen
to
the
carpet
her
lips
were
drawn
back
and
her
eyes
wide
wide
open
they
saw
nothing
now
what
had
they
seen
last
the
doctor
moved
towards
her
but
i
pushed
him
aside
and
sprang
to
her
caught
her
in
my
arms
and
cried
it
all
right
laura
i
got
you
safe
wifie
she
fell
into
my
arms
in
a
heap
i
clasped
her
and
kissed
her
and
called
her
by
all
her
pet
names
but
i
think
i
knew
all
the
time
that
she
was
dead
her
hands
were
tightly
clenched
in
one
of
them
she
held
something
fast
when
i
was
quite
sure
that
she
was
dead
and
that
nothing
mattered
at
all
any
more
i
let
him
open
her
hand
to
see
what
she
held
it
was
a
grey
marble
finger
mass
for
the
i
was
awake
widely
cruelly
awake
i
had
been
awake
all
night
what
sleep
could
there
be
for
me
when
the
woman
i
loved
was
to
be
married
next
morning
married
and
not
to
me
i
went
to
my
room
early
the
family
party
in
the
maddened
me
grouped
about
the
round
table
with
the
stamped
plush
cover
each
was
busy
with
work
or
book
or
newspaper
but
not
too
busy
to
stab
my
heart
through
and
through
with
their
talk
of
the
wedding
her
people
were
near
neighbours
of
mine
so
why
should
her
marriage
not
be
canvassed
in
my
home
circle
they
did
not
mean
to
be
cruel
they
did
not
know
that
i
loved
her
but
she
knew
it
i
told
her
but
she
knew
it
before
that
she
knew
it
from
the
moment
when
i
came
back
from
three
years
of
musical
study
in
germany
came
back
and
met
her
in
the
wood
where
we
used
to
go
nutting
when
we
were
children
i
looked
into
her
eyes
and
my
whole
soul
trembled
with
thankfulness
that
i
was
living
in
a
world
that
held
her
also
i
turned
and
walked
by
her
side
through
the
tangled
green
wood
and
we
talked
of
the
days
and
it
was
have
you
forgotten
and
do
you
remember
till
we
reached
her
garden
gate
then
i
said
no
and
in
a
very
little
time
i
hope
and
she
answered
by
the
way
you
have
congratulated
me
yet
congratulated
you
yes
did
i
not
tell
you
i
am
to
marry
benoliel
next
month
and
she
turned
away
and
went
up
the
garden
slowly
i
asked
my
people
and
they
said
it
was
true
kate
my
dear
playfellow
was
to
marry
this
spaniard
rich
wilful
accustomed
to
win
polished
in
manners
and
base
in
life
why
was
she
to
marry
him
no
one
knows
said
my
father
but
her
father
is
talked
about
in
the
city
and
benoliel
the
spaniard
is
rich
perhaps
that
it
that
was
it
she
told
me
so
when
after
two
weeks
spent
with
her
and
near
her
i
implored
her
to
break
so
vile
a
chain
and
to
come
to
me
who
loved
her
whom
she
loved
you
are
quite
right
she
said
calmly
we
were
sitting
in
the
of
the
oak
parlour
in
her
father
desolate
old
house
i
do
love
you
and
i
shall
marry
mr
benoliel
why
look
around
you
and
ask
me
why
if
you
can
i
looked
around
on
the
shabby
bare
room
with
its
faded
hangings
of
moreen
its
threadbare
carpet
its
patched
chintz
i
looked
out
through
the
square
latticed
window
at
the
ragged
unkempt
lawn
at
her
own
gown
of
poor
material
though
she
wore
it
as
queens
might
desire
to
wear
ermine
and
i
understood
kate
is
obstinate
it
is
her
one
fault
i
knew
how
vain
would
be
my
entreaties
yet
i
offered
them
how
unavailing
my
arguments
yet
they
were
set
forth
how
useless
my
love
and
my
sorrow
yet
i
showed
them
to
her
no
she
answered
but
she
flung
her
arms
round
my
neck
as
she
spoke
and
held
me
as
one
may
hold
one
best
treasure
no
no
you
are
poor
and
he
is
rich
you
would
have
me
break
my
father
heart
he
so
proud
and
if
he
does
get
some
money
next
month
he
will
be
ruined
i
not
deceiving
any
one
benoliel
knows
i
do
care
for
him
and
if
i
marry
him
he
is
going
to
advance
my
father
a
large
sum
of
money
oh
i
assure
you
that
everything
has
been
talked
over
and
settled
there
is
no
going
from
it
child
child
i
cried
how
calmly
you
speak
of
it
do
you
see
that
you
are
selling
your
soul
and
throwing
mine
away
father
fabian
says
i
am
doing
right
she
answered
unclasping
her
hands
but
holding
mine
in
them
and
looking
at
me
with
those
clear
grey
eyes
of
hers
are
we
to
be
unselfish
in
everything
else
and
in
love
to
think
only
of
our
own
happiness
i
love
you
and
i
shall
marry
him
would
you
rather
the
positions
were
reversed
yes
i
said
for
then
i
would
make
you
love
me
perhaps
will
she
said
bitterly
even
in
that
moment
her
mouth
trembled
with
the
ghost
of
a
smile
she
always
loved
to
tease
she
goes
through
more
moods
in
a
day
than
most
other
women
in
a
year
drowning
the
smile
came
tears
but
she
controlled
them
and
she
said
you
see
i
am
right
do
you
oh
jasper
i
wish
i
told
you
i
loved
you
it
will
only
make
you
more
unhappy
it
makes
my
one
happiness
i
answered
nothing
can
take
that
from
me
and
that
happiness
will
never
have
say
again
that
you
love
me
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
you
with
further
folly
of
tears
and
mad
loving
words
we
parted
and
i
bore
my
heartache
away
leaving
her
to
bear
hers
into
her
new
life
and
now
she
was
to
be
married
and
i
could
not
sleep
when
the
darkness
became
unbearable
i
lighted
a
candle
and
then
lay
staring
vacantly
at
the
roses
on
the
or
following
with
my
eyes
the
lines
and
curves
of
the
heavy
mahogany
furniture
the
solidity
of
my
surroundings
oppressed
me
in
the
dull
light
the
wardrobe
loomed
like
a
hearse
and
my
violin
case
looked
like
a
coffin
i
reached
a
book
and
read
till
my
eyes
ached
and
the
letters
danced
a
up
and
down
the
page
i
got
up
and
had
ten
minutes
with
the
dumbbells
i
sponged
my
face
and
hands
with
cold
water
and
tried
again
to
sleep
vainly
i
lay
there
miserably
wide
awake
i
tried
to
say
poetry
the
tasks
of
my
school
days
even
but
through
everything
ran
the
refrain
kate
is
to
be
married
and
not
to
me
not
to
me
i
tried
counting
up
to
a
thousand
i
tried
to
imagine
sheep
in
a
lane
and
to
count
them
as
they
jumped
through
a
gap
in
an
imaginary
hedge
all
the
spells
with
which
sleep
is
wooed
vainly
then
the
waits
came
and
a
torture
to
the
nerves
was
superadded
to
the
torture
of
the
heart
after
fifteen
minutes
of
carols
every
fibre
of
me
seemed
vibrating
in
an
agony
of
physical
misery
to
banish
the
echo
of
the
mistletoe
bough
i
hummed
softly
to
myself
a
melody
of
palestrina
and
felt
more
awake
than
ever
then
the
thing
happened
which
nothing
will
ever
explain
as
i
lay
there
i
heard
breaking
through
and
gradually
overpowering
the
air
i
was
suggesting
a
harmony
which
i
had
never
heard
before
beautiful
beyond
description
and
as
distinct
and
definite
as
any
song
man
ears
have
ever
listened
to
my
first
thought
was
more
waits
but
the
music
was
choral
music
true
and
sweet
with
it
mingled
an
organ
notes
and
with
every
note
the
music
grew
in
volume
it
is
absurd
to
suggest
that
i
dreamed
it
for
still
hearing
the
music
i
leaped
out
of
bed
and
opened
the
window
the
music
grew
fainter
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
in
the
snowy
garden
below
shivering
i
shut
the
window
the
music
grew
more
distinct
and
i
became
aware
that
i
was
listening
to
a
mass
a
funeral
mass
and
one
which
i
had
never
heard
before
i
lay
in
my
bed
and
followed
the
whole
course
of
the
office
the
music
ceased
i
was
sitting
up
in
bed
my
candle
alight
and
myself
as
wide
awake
as
ever
and
more
than
ever
possessed
by
the
thought
of
but
with
a
difference
before
i
had
only
mourned
the
loss
of
her
now
my
thoughts
of
her
were
mingled
with
an
indescribable
dread
the
sense
of
death
and
decay
that
had
come
to
me
with
that
strange
beautiful
music
coloured
all
my
thoughts
i
was
filled
with
fancies
of
hushed
houses
black
garments
rooms
where
white
flowers
and
white
linen
lay
in
a
deathly
stillness
i
heard
echoes
of
tears
and
of
bells
tolling
monotonously
i
shivered
as
it
were
on
the
brink
of
irreparable
woe
and
in
its
contemplation
i
watched
the
dull
dawn
slowly
overcome
the
pale
flame
of
my
candle
now
burnt
down
into
its
socket
i
felt
that
i
must
see
kate
once
again
before
she
gave
herself
away
before
ten
i
was
in
the
oak
parlour
she
came
to
me
as
she
entered
the
room
her
pallor
her
swollen
eyelids
and
the
misery
in
her
eyes
wrung
my
heart
as
even
that
night
of
agony
had
not
done
i
literally
could
not
speak
i
held
out
my
hands
would
she
reproach
me
for
coming
to
her
again
for
forcing
upon
her
a
second
time
the
anguish
of
parting
she
did
not
she
laid
her
hands
in
mine
and
said
i
am
thankful
you
have
come
do
you
know
i
think
i
am
going
mad
let
me
go
mad
jasper
the
look
in
her
eyes
underlined
her
words
i
stammered
something
and
kissed
her
hands
i
was
with
her
again
and
joy
fought
again
with
grief
i
must
tell
some
one
if
i
am
mad
do
lock
me
up
take
care
of
me
wo
you
would
i
not
understand
she
went
on
it
was
not
a
dream
i
was
wide
awake
thinking
of
you
the
waits
had
not
long
gone
and
i
i
was
looking
at
your
likeness
i
was
not
asleep
i
shivered
as
i
held
her
fast
as
heaven
sees
us
i
did
not
dream
it
i
heard
a
mass
sung
and
jasper
it
was
a
mass
for
the
dead
i
followed
the
office
you
are
not
a
catholic
but
i
thought
i
feared
oh
i
do
know
what
i
thought
i
am
thankful
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
you
i
felt
a
sudden
certainty
and
complete
sense
of
power
possess
me
now
in
this
her
moment
of
weakness
while
she
was
so
completely
under
the
influence
of
a
strong
emotion
i
could
and
would
save
her
from
benoliel
and
myself
from
pain
kate
i
said
i
believe
it
is
a
warning
you
shall
not
marry
this
man
you
shall
marry
me
and
none
other
she
leaned
her
head
against
my
shoulder
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
father
and
all
the
reasons
for
her
marriage
with
benoliel
you
do
think
i
mad
no
then
take
care
of
me
take
me
away
i
feel
safe
with
you
thus
all
obstacles
vanished
in
less
time
than
the
length
of
a
kiss
i
dared
not
stop
to
consider
the
coincidence
of
supernatural
warning
nor
what
it
might
mean
face
to
face
with
crowned
hope
i
am
proud
to
remember
that
common
sense
held
her
own
the
room
in
which
we
were
had
a
french
window
i
fetched
her
garden
hat
and
a
shawl
from
the
hall
and
we
went
out
through
the
still
white
garden
we
did
not
meet
a
soul
when
we
reached
my
father
garden
i
took
her
in
by
the
back
way
to
the
and
left
her
though
i
was
half
afraid
to
leave
her
while
i
went
into
the
house
i
snatched
my
violin
and
cheque
book
took
all
my
spare
money
scrawled
a
line
to
my
father
and
rejoined
her
still
no
one
had
seen
us
we
walked
to
a
station
five
miles
away
and
by
the
time
benoliel
would
reach
the
church
i
was
leaving
doctors
commons
with
a
special
licence
in
my
pocket
two
hours
later
kate
was
my
wife
and
we
were
quietly
and
prosaically
eating
our
in
the
of
the
grand
hotel
and
where
shall
we
go
i
said
i
do
know
she
answered
smiling
you
have
not
much
money
have
you
oh
dear
me
yes
i
not
rich
but
i
not
absolutely
a
church
mouse
could
we
go
to
devonshire
she
asked
twisting
her
new
ring
round
and
round
devonshire
why
that
is
where
yes
i
know
benoliel
arranged
to
go
there
jasper
i
am
afraid
of
benoliel
then
why
foolish
person
she
answered
do
you
think
that
benoliel
will
be
likely
to
go
to
devonshire
we
went
to
devonshire
i
had
had
a
small
legacy
a
few
months
earlier
and
i
did
not
permit
money
cares
to
trouble
my
new
and
beautiful
happiness
my
only
fear
was
that
she
would
be
saddened
by
thoughts
of
her
father
but
i
am
thankful
to
remember
that
in
those
first
days
she
too
was
happy
so
happy
that
there
seemed
to
be
hardly
room
in
her
mind
for
any
thought
but
of
me
and
every
hour
of
every
day
i
said
to
my
soul
but
for
that
portent
whatever
it
boded
she
might
have
been
not
my
wife
but
his
the
first
four
or
five
days
of
our
marriage
are
flowers
that
memory
keeps
always
fresh
kate
face
had
recovered
its
bloom
and
she
laughed
and
sang
and
jested
and
enjoyed
all
our
little
daily
adventures
with
the
fullest
gaiety
then
i
committed
the
supreme
imbecility
of
my
life
one
of
those
acts
of
folly
on
which
one
looks
back
all
one
life
with
a
half
stamp
of
the
foot
and
the
unanswerable
question
how
on
earth
could
i
have
been
such
a
fool
we
were
sitting
in
a
little
hideous
in
intention
but
redeemed
by
blazing
fire
and
the
fact
that
two
were
there
sitting
gazing
into
the
fire
and
talking
of
their
future
and
of
their
love
there
was
nothing
to
trouble
us
no
one
had
discovered
our
whereabouts
and
my
wife
fear
of
benoliel
revenge
seemed
to
have
dissolved
before
the
flame
of
our
happiness
and
as
we
sat
there
peaceful
and
untroubled
the
imp
of
the
perverse
jogged
my
elbow
as
alas
he
does
so
often
and
i
was
moved
to
tell
my
wife
that
i
too
had
heard
that
unearthly
midnight
music
that
her
hearing
of
it
was
not
as
she
had
grown
to
think
a
mere
nightmare
a
strange
dream
but
something
more
strange
more
significant
i
told
her
how
i
had
heard
the
mass
for
the
dead
and
all
the
tale
of
that
night
she
listened
silently
and
i
thought
her
strangely
indifferent
when
i
had
finished
she
took
her
hand
from
mine
and
covered
her
face
i
believe
it
was
a
warning
to
us
to
flee
temptation
we
ought
never
to
have
married
oh
my
poor
father
her
tone
was
one
that
i
had
never
heard
before
its
hopeless
misery
appalled
me
and
justly
for
no
arguments
no
entreaties
no
caresses
could
win
my
wife
back
to
the
mood
of
an
hour
before
she
tried
to
be
cheerful
but
her
gaiety
was
forced
and
her
laughter
stung
my
heart
she
spoke
no
more
about
the
music
and
when
i
tried
to
reason
with
her
about
it
she
smiled
a
gloomy
little
smile
and
said
i
can
not
be
happy
i
will
not
be
happy
it
is
wrong
i
have
been
very
selfish
and
wicked
you
think
me
very
idiotic
i
know
but
i
believe
there
is
a
curse
on
us
we
shall
never
be
happy
again
do
you
love
me
any
more
i
asked
like
a
fool
love
you
she
only
repeated
my
words
but
i
was
satisfied
on
that
score
but
those
were
miserable
days
we
loved
each
other
passionately
yet
our
hours
were
spent
like
those
of
lovers
on
the
eve
of
parting
long
long
silences
took
the
place
of
foolish
little
jokes
and
childish
talk
which
happy
lovers
know
and
more
than
once
waking
in
the
night
i
heard
my
wife
sobbing
and
feigned
sleep
with
the
bitter
knowledge
that
i
had
no
power
to
comfort
her
i
knew
that
the
thought
of
her
father
was
with
her
always
and
that
her
anxiety
about
him
grew
day
by
day
i
wore
myself
out
in
trying
to
think
of
some
way
to
divert
her
thoughts
from
him
i
could
not
indeed
pay
his
debts
but
i
could
have
him
to
live
with
us
a
much
greater
sacrifice
and
having
a
good
connection
both
as
a
musician
and
composer
i
did
not
doubt
that
i
could
support
her
and
him
in
comfort
but
kate
had
made
up
her
mind
that
the
disgrace
of
bankruptcy
would
break
her
father
heart
and
my
kate
is
not
easy
to
convince
or
persuade
at
torquay
it
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
it
would
be
well
for
her
to
see
a
priest
true
father
fabian
had
counselled
her
to
marry
benoliel
but
i
could
hardly
believe
that
most
priests
would
advise
a
girl
to
marry
a
bad
man
whom
she
did
not
love
for
the
sake
of
any
worldly
gain
whatsoever
she
received
the
suggestion
with
favour
but
without
enthusiasm
and
we
sought
out
a
catholic
church
to
make
inquiries
as
we
opened
the
outer
door
of
the
church
we
heard
music
and
as
we
stood
in
the
entrance
and
i
laid
my
hand
on
the
heavy
inner
door
my
other
hand
was
caught
by
kate
jasper
she
whispered
it
is
the
same
some
person
opening
the
door
behind
us
compelled
us
to
move
forward
in
another
moment
we
stood
in
the
dusky
church
stood
in
dim
daylight
listening
to
the
same
music
that
each
had
heard
in
the
lonely
night
on
the
eve
of
our
wedding
i
put
my
arm
round
my
wife
and
drew
her
back
come
away
my
darling
i
whispered
it
is
a
funeral
service
she
turned
her
eyes
on
me
i
understand
i
must
see
who
it
is
i
shall
go
mad
if
you
take
me
away
now
i
can
not
bear
any
more
we
walked
up
the
aisle
and
placed
ourselves
as
near
as
possible
to
the
spot
where
the
coffin
lay
covered
with
flowers
and
with
tapers
burning
about
it
and
we
heard
that
music
again
every
note
of
it
the
same
that
each
had
heard
before
and
when
the
service
was
over
i
whispered
to
the
sacristan
whose
music
was
that
our
organist
he
answered
it
is
the
first
time
they
had
it
fine
was
it
who
is
the
who
was
who
is
being
buried
a
foreign
gentleman
sir
they
do
say
as
his
lady
as
was
to
be
gave
him
the
slip
on
his
wedding
day
and
he
given
her
father
thousands
they
say
if
the
truth
was
known
but
what
was
he
doing
here
well
that
the
curious
part
sir
to
show
his
independence
what
does
he
do
but
go
the
same
tour
he
planned
for
his
wedding
trip
and
there
was
a
railway
accident
and
him
and
every
one
in
his
carriage
killed
in
a
twinkling
so
to
speak
lucky
for
the
young
lady
she
was
off
with
somebody
else
the
sacristan
laughed
softly
to
himself
kate
fingers
gripped
my
arm
what
was
his
name
she
asked
i
would
not
have
asked
i
did
not
wish
to
hear
it
benoliel
said
the
sacristan
curious
name
and
curious
tale
every
one
talking
of
it
every
one
had
something
else
to
talk
of
when
it
was
found
that
benoliel
pride
which
had
permitted
him
to
buy
a
wife
had
shrunk
from
reclaiming
the
purchase
money
when
the
purchase
was
lost
to
him
and
to
the
man
who
had
been
willing
to
sell
his
daughter
the
retention
of
her
price
seemed
perfectly
natural
from
the
moment
when
she
heard
benoliel
name
on
the
sacristan
lips
all
kate
gaiety
and
happiness
returned
she
loved
me
and
she
hated
benoliel
she
was
married
to
me
and
he
was
dead
and
his
death
was
far
more
of
a
shock
to
me
than
to
her
women
are
curiously
kind
and
curiously
cruel
and
she
never
could
see
why
her
father
should
not
have
kept
the
money
it
is
noteworthy
that
women
even
the
cleverest
and
the
best
of
them
have
no
perception
of
what
men
mean
by
honour
how
do
i
account
for
the
music
my
good
critic
my
business
is
to
tell
my
story
not
to
account
for
it
and
do
i
not
pity
benoliel
yes
i
can
afford
now
to
pity
most
men
alive
or
dead
