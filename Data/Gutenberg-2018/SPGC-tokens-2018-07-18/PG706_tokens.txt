the
ides
of
march
i
it
was
twelve
when
i
returned
to
the
albany
as
a
last
desperate
resort
the
scene
of
my
disaster
was
much
as
i
had
left
it
the
still
strewed
the
table
with
the
empty
glasses
and
the
loaded
a
window
had
been
opened
to
let
the
smoke
out
and
was
letting
in
the
fog
instead
raffles
himself
had
merely
discarded
his
dining
jacket
for
one
of
his
innumerable
blazers
yet
he
arched
his
eyebrows
as
though
i
had
dragged
him
from
his
bed
forgotten
something
said
he
when
he
saw
me
on
his
mat
no
said
i
pushing
past
him
without
ceremony
and
i
led
the
way
into
his
room
with
an
impudence
amazing
to
myself
not
come
back
for
your
revenge
have
you
because
i
afraid
i
give
it
to
you
i
was
sorry
myself
that
the
others
we
were
face
to
face
by
his
fireside
and
i
cut
him
short
raffles
said
i
you
may
well
be
surprised
at
my
coming
back
in
this
way
and
at
this
hour
i
hardly
know
you
i
was
never
in
your
rooms
before
but
i
fagged
for
you
at
school
and
you
said
you
remembered
me
of
course
that
no
excuse
but
will
you
listen
to
me
for
two
minutes
in
my
emotion
i
had
at
first
to
struggle
for
every
word
but
his
face
reassured
me
as
i
went
on
and
i
was
not
mistaken
in
its
expression
certainly
my
dear
man
said
he
as
many
minutes
as
you
like
have
a
sullivan
and
sit
down
and
he
handed
me
his
silver
no
said
i
finding
a
full
voice
as
i
shook
my
head
no
i
smoke
and
i
wo
sit
down
thank
you
nor
will
you
ask
me
to
do
either
when
you
heard
what
i
have
to
say
really
said
he
lighting
his
own
cigarette
with
one
clear
blue
eye
upon
me
how
do
you
know
because
you
probably
show
me
the
door
i
cried
bitterly
and
you
will
be
justified
in
doing
it
but
it
no
use
beating
about
the
bush
you
know
i
dropped
over
two
hundred
just
now
he
nodded
i
had
the
money
in
my
pocket
i
remember
but
i
had
my
and
i
wrote
each
of
you
a
check
at
that
desk
well
not
one
of
them
was
worth
the
paper
it
was
written
on
raffles
i
am
overdrawn
already
at
my
bank
surely
only
for
the
moment
no
i
have
spent
everything
but
somebody
told
me
you
were
so
well
off
i
heard
you
had
come
in
for
money
so
i
did
three
years
ago
it
has
been
my
curse
now
it
all
gone
every
penny
yes
i
been
a
fool
there
never
was
nor
will
be
such
a
fool
as
i
been
is
this
enough
for
you
why
do
you
turn
me
out
he
was
walking
up
and
down
with
a
very
long
face
instead
could
your
people
do
anything
he
asked
at
length
thank
god
i
cried
i
have
no
people
i
was
an
only
child
i
came
in
for
everything
there
was
my
one
comfort
is
that
they
gone
and
will
never
know
i
cast
myself
into
a
chair
and
hid
my
face
raffles
continued
to
pace
the
rich
carpet
that
was
of
a
piece
with
everything
else
in
his
rooms
there
was
no
variation
in
his
soft
and
even
footfalls
you
used
to
be
a
literary
little
cuss
he
said
at
length
did
you
edit
the
mag
before
you
left
anyway
i
recollect
fagging
you
to
do
my
verses
and
literature
of
all
sorts
is
the
very
thing
nowadays
any
fool
can
make
a
living
at
it
i
shook
my
head
any
fool
could
write
off
my
debts
said
i
then
you
have
a
flat
somewhere
he
went
on
yes
in
mount
street
well
what
about
the
furniture
i
laughed
aloud
in
my
misery
there
been
a
bill
of
sale
on
every
stick
for
months
and
at
that
raffles
stood
still
with
raised
eyebrows
and
stern
eyes
that
i
could
meet
the
better
now
that
he
knew
the
worst
then
with
a
shrug
he
resumed
his
walk
and
for
some
minutes
neither
of
us
spoke
but
in
his
handsome
unmoved
face
i
read
my
fate
and
and
with
every
breath
i
cursed
my
folly
and
my
cowardice
in
coming
to
him
at
all
because
he
had
been
kind
to
me
at
school
when
he
was
captain
of
the
eleven
and
i
his
fag
i
had
dared
to
look
for
kindness
from
him
now
because
i
was
ruined
and
he
rich
enough
to
play
cricket
all
the
summer
and
do
nothing
for
the
rest
of
the
year
i
had
fatuously
counted
on
his
mercy
his
sympathy
his
help
yes
i
had
relied
on
him
in
my
heart
for
all
my
outward
diffidence
and
humility
and
i
was
rightly
served
there
was
as
little
of
mercy
as
of
sympathy
in
that
curling
nostril
that
rigid
jaw
that
cold
blue
eye
which
never
glanced
my
way
i
caught
up
my
hat
i
blundered
to
my
feet
i
would
have
gone
without
a
word
but
raffles
stood
between
me
and
the
door
where
are
you
going
said
he
that
my
business
i
replied
i
wo
trouble
you
any
more
then
how
am
i
to
help
you
i
did
ask
your
help
then
why
come
to
me
why
indeed
i
echoed
will
you
let
me
pass
not
until
you
tell
me
where
you
are
going
and
what
you
mean
to
do
ca
you
guess
i
cried
and
for
many
seconds
we
stood
staring
in
each
other
eyes
have
you
got
the
pluck
said
he
breaking
the
spell
in
a
tone
so
cynical
that
it
brought
my
last
drop
of
blood
to
the
boil
you
shall
see
said
i
as
i
stepped
back
and
whipped
the
pistol
from
my
overcoat
pocket
now
will
you
let
me
pass
or
shall
i
do
it
here
the
barrel
touched
my
temple
and
my
thumb
the
trigger
mad
with
excitement
as
i
was
ruined
dishonored
and
now
finally
determined
to
make
an
end
of
my
misspent
life
my
only
surprise
to
this
day
is
that
i
did
not
do
so
then
and
there
the
despicable
satisfaction
of
involving
another
in
one
destruction
added
its
miserable
appeal
to
my
baser
egoism
and
had
fear
or
horror
flown
to
my
companion
face
i
shudder
to
think
i
might
have
died
diabolically
happy
with
that
look
for
my
last
impious
consolation
it
was
the
look
that
came
instead
which
held
my
hand
neither
fear
nor
horror
were
in
it
only
wonder
admiration
and
such
a
measure
of
pleased
expectancy
as
caused
me
after
all
to
pocket
my
revolver
with
an
oath
you
devil
i
said
i
believe
you
wanted
me
to
do
it
not
quite
was
the
reply
made
with
a
little
start
and
a
change
of
color
that
came
too
late
to
tell
you
the
truth
though
i
half
thought
you
meant
it
and
i
was
never
more
fascinated
in
my
life
i
never
dreamt
you
had
such
stuff
in
you
bunny
no
i
hanged
if
i
let
you
go
now
and
you
better
not
try
that
game
again
for
you
catch
me
stand
and
look
on
a
second
time
we
must
think
of
some
way
out
of
the
mess
i
had
no
idea
you
were
a
chap
of
that
sort
there
let
me
have
the
gun
one
of
his
hands
fell
kindly
on
my
shoulder
while
the
other
slipped
into
my
overcoat
pocket
and
i
suffered
him
to
deprive
me
of
my
weapon
without
a
murmur
nor
was
this
simply
because
raffles
had
the
subtle
power
of
making
himself
irresistible
at
will
he
was
beyond
comparison
the
most
masterful
man
whom
i
have
ever
known
yet
my
acquiescence
was
due
to
more
than
the
mere
subjection
of
the
weaker
nature
to
the
stronger
the
forlorn
hope
which
had
brought
me
to
the
albany
was
turned
as
by
magic
into
an
almost
staggering
sense
of
safety
raffles
would
help
me
after
all
raffles
would
be
my
friend
it
was
as
though
all
the
world
had
come
round
suddenly
to
my
side
so
far
therefore
from
resisting
his
action
i
caught
and
clasped
his
hand
with
a
fervor
as
uncontrollable
as
the
frenzy
which
had
preceded
it
god
bless
you
i
cried
forgive
me
for
everything
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
i
did
think
you
might
help
me
in
my
extremity
though
i
well
knew
that
i
had
no
claim
upon
you
still
for
the
old
sake
the
sake
of
old
times
i
thought
you
might
give
me
another
chance
if
you
would
i
meant
to
blow
out
my
brains
and
will
still
if
you
change
your
mind
in
truth
i
feared
that
it
was
changing
with
his
expression
even
as
i
spoke
and
in
spite
of
his
kindly
tone
and
kindlier
use
of
my
old
school
nickname
his
next
words
showed
me
my
mistake
what
a
boy
it
is
for
jumping
to
conclusions
i
have
my
vices
bunny
but
backing
and
filling
is
not
one
of
them
sit
down
my
good
fellow
and
have
a
cigarette
to
soothe
your
nerves
i
insist
whiskey
the
worst
thing
for
you
here
some
coffee
that
i
was
brewing
when
you
came
in
now
listen
to
me
you
speak
of
chance
what
do
you
mean
another
chance
at
baccarat
not
if
i
know
it
you
think
the
luck
must
turn
suppose
it
did
we
should
only
have
made
bad
worse
no
my
dear
chap
you
plunged
enough
do
you
put
yourself
in
my
hands
or
do
you
not
very
well
then
you
plunge
no
more
and
i
undertake
not
to
present
my
check
unfortunately
there
are
the
other
men
and
still
more
unfortunately
bunny
i
as
hard
up
at
this
moment
as
you
are
yourself
it
was
my
turn
to
stare
at
raffles
you
i
vociferated
you
hard
up
how
am
i
to
sit
here
and
believe
that
did
i
refuse
to
believe
it
of
you
he
returned
smiling
and
with
your
own
experience
do
you
think
that
because
a
fellow
has
rooms
in
this
place
and
belongs
to
a
club
or
two
and
plays
a
little
cricket
he
must
necessarily
have
a
balance
at
the
bank
i
tell
you
my
dear
man
that
at
this
moment
i
as
hard
up
as
you
ever
were
i
have
nothing
but
my
wits
to
live
on
absolutely
nothing
else
it
was
as
necessary
for
me
to
win
some
money
this
evening
as
it
was
for
you
we
in
the
same
boat
bunny
we
better
pull
together
together
i
jumped
at
it
i
do
anything
in
this
world
for
you
raffles
i
said
if
you
really
mean
that
you
wo
give
me
away
think
of
anything
you
like
and
i
do
it
i
was
a
desperate
man
when
i
came
here
and
i
just
as
desperate
now
i
do
mind
what
i
do
if
only
i
can
get
out
of
this
without
a
scandal
again
i
see
him
leaning
back
in
one
of
the
luxurious
chairs
with
which
his
room
was
furnished
i
see
his
indolent
athletic
figure
his
pale
sharp
features
his
curly
black
hair
his
strong
unscrupulous
mouth
and
again
i
feel
the
clear
beam
of
his
wonderful
eye
cold
and
luminous
as
a
star
shining
into
my
brain
sifting
the
very
secrets
of
my
heart
i
wonder
if
you
mean
all
that
he
said
at
length
you
do
in
your
present
mood
but
who
can
back
his
mood
to
last
still
there
hope
when
a
chap
takes
that
tone
now
i
think
of
it
too
you
were
a
plucky
little
devil
at
school
you
once
did
me
rather
a
good
turn
i
recollect
remember
it
bunny
well
wait
a
bit
and
perhaps
i
be
able
to
do
you
a
better
one
give
me
time
to
think
he
got
up
lit
a
fresh
cigarette
and
fell
to
pacing
the
room
once
more
but
with
a
slower
and
more
thoughtful
step
and
for
a
much
longer
period
than
before
twice
he
stopped
at
my
chair
as
though
on
the
point
of
speaking
but
each
time
he
checked
himself
and
resumed
his
stride
in
silence
once
he
threw
up
the
window
which
he
had
shut
some
time
since
and
stood
for
some
moments
leaning
out
into
the
fog
which
filled
the
albany
courtyard
meanwhile
a
clock
on
the
struck
one
and
one
again
for
the
without
a
word
between
us
yet
i
not
only
kept
my
chair
with
patience
but
i
acquired
an
incongruous
equanimity
in
that
insensibly
i
had
shifted
my
burden
to
the
broad
shoulders
of
this
splendid
friend
and
my
thoughts
wandered
with
my
eyes
as
the
minutes
passed
the
room
was
the
square
one
with
the
folding
doors
the
marble
and
the
gloomy
distinction
peculiar
to
the
albany
it
was
charmingly
furnished
and
arranged
with
the
right
amount
of
negligence
and
the
right
amount
of
taste
what
struck
me
most
however
was
the
absence
of
the
usual
insignia
of
a
den
instead
of
the
conventional
rack
of
bats
a
carved
oak
bookcase
with
every
shelf
in
a
litter
filled
the
better
part
of
one
wall
and
where
i
looked
for
cricketing
groups
i
found
reproductions
of
such
works
as
love
and
death
and
the
blessed
damozel
in
dusty
frames
and
different
parallels
the
man
might
have
been
a
minor
poet
instead
of
an
athlete
of
the
first
water
but
there
had
always
been
a
fine
streak
of
aestheticism
in
his
complex
composition
some
of
these
very
pictures
i
had
myself
dusted
in
his
study
at
school
and
they
set
me
thinking
of
yet
another
of
his
many
sides
and
of
the
little
incident
to
which
he
had
just
referred
everybody
knows
how
largely
the
tone
of
a
public
school
depends
on
that
of
the
eleven
and
on
the
character
of
the
captain
of
cricket
in
particular
and
i
have
never
heard
it
denied
that
in
time
our
tone
was
good
or
that
such
influence
as
he
troubled
to
exert
was
on
the
side
of
the
angels
yet
it
was
whispered
in
the
school
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
parading
the
town
at
night
in
loud
checks
and
a
false
beard
it
was
whispered
and
disbelieved
i
alone
knew
it
for
a
fact
for
night
after
night
had
i
pulled
the
rope
up
after
him
when
the
rest
of
the
dormitory
were
asleep
and
kept
awake
by
the
hour
to
let
it
down
again
on
a
given
signal
well
one
night
he
was
and
within
an
ace
of
ignominious
expulsion
in
the
of
his
fame
consummate
daring
and
extraordinary
nerve
on
his
part
aided
doubtless
by
some
little
presence
of
mind
on
mine
averted
the
untoward
result
and
no
more
need
be
said
of
a
discreditable
incident
but
i
can
not
pretend
to
have
forgotten
it
in
throwing
myself
on
this
man
mercy
in
my
desperation
and
i
was
wondering
how
much
of
his
leniency
was
owing
to
the
fact
that
raffles
had
not
forgotten
it
either
when
he
stopped
and
stood
over
my
chair
once
more
i
been
thinking
of
that
night
we
had
the
narrow
squeak
he
began
why
do
you
start
i
was
thinking
of
it
too
he
smiled
as
though
he
had
read
my
thoughts
well
you
were
the
right
sort
of
little
beggar
then
bunny
you
talk
and
you
did
flinch
you
asked
no
questions
and
you
told
no
tales
i
wonder
if
you
like
that
now
i
do
know
said
i
slightly
puzzled
by
his
tone
i
made
such
a
mess
of
my
own
affairs
that
i
trust
myself
about
as
little
as
likely
to
be
trusted
by
anybody
else
yet
i
never
in
my
life
went
back
on
a
friend
i
will
say
that
otherwise
perhaps
i
might
be
in
such
a
hole
exactly
said
raffles
nodding
to
himself
as
though
in
assent
to
some
hidden
train
of
thought
exactly
what
i
remember
of
you
and
bet
it
as
true
now
as
it
was
ten
years
ago
we
do
alter
bunny
we
only
develop
i
suppose
neither
you
nor
i
are
really
altered
since
you
used
to
let
down
that
rope
and
i
used
to
come
up
it
hand
over
hand
you
would
stick
at
nothing
for
a
pal
what
at
nothing
in
this
world
i
was
pleased
to
cry
not
even
at
a
crime
said
raffles
smiling
i
stopped
to
think
for
his
tone
had
changed
and
i
felt
sure
he
was
chaffing
me
yet
his
eye
seemed
as
much
in
earnest
as
ever
and
for
my
part
i
was
in
no
mood
for
reservations
no
not
even
at
that
i
declared
name
your
crime
and
i
your
man
he
looked
at
me
one
moment
in
wonder
and
another
moment
in
doubt
then
turned
the
matter
off
with
a
shake
of
his
head
and
the
little
cynical
laugh
that
was
all
his
own
you
a
nice
chap
bunny
a
real
desperate
character
what
suicide
one
moment
and
any
crime
i
like
the
next
what
you
want
is
a
drag
my
boy
and
you
did
well
to
come
to
a
decent
citizen
with
a
reputation
to
lose
none
the
less
we
must
have
that
money
by
hook
or
crook
raffles
the
sooner
the
better
every
hour
after
ten
morning
is
an
hour
of
risk
let
one
of
those
checks
get
round
to
your
own
bank
and
you
and
it
are
dishonored
together
no
we
must
raise
the
wind
and
your
account
first
thing
and
i
rather
think
i
know
where
the
wind
can
be
raised
at
two
in
the
morning
yes
but
how
but
where
at
such
an
hour
from
a
friend
of
mine
here
in
bond
street
he
must
be
a
very
intimate
friend
intimate
not
the
word
i
have
the
run
of
his
place
and
a
all
to
myself
you
would
knock
him
up
at
this
hour
of
the
night
if
he
in
bed
and
it
essential
that
i
should
go
in
with
you
absolutely
then
i
must
but
i
bound
to
say
i
do
like
the
idea
raffles
do
you
prefer
the
alternative
asked
my
companion
with
a
sneer
no
hang
it
that
unfair
he
cried
apologetically
in
the
same
breath
i
quite
understand
it
a
beastly
ordeal
but
it
would
never
do
for
you
to
stay
outside
i
tell
you
what
you
shall
have
a
peg
before
we
start
just
one
there
the
whiskey
here
a
syphon
and
i
be
putting
on
an
overcoat
while
you
help
yourself
well
i
daresay
i
did
so
with
some
freedom
for
this
plan
of
his
was
not
the
less
distasteful
to
me
from
its
apparent
inevitability
i
must
own
however
that
it
possessed
fewer
terrors
before
my
glass
was
empty
meanwhile
raffles
rejoined
me
with
a
covert
coat
over
his
blazer
and
a
soft
felt
hat
set
carelessly
on
the
curly
head
he
shook
with
a
smile
as
i
passed
him
the
decanter
when
we
come
back
said
he
work
first
play
afterward
do
you
see
what
day
it
is
he
added
tearing
a
leaflet
from
a
shakespearian
calendar
as
i
drained
my
glass
march
ides
of
march
the
ides
of
march
remember
eh
bunny
my
boy
you
wo
forget
them
will
you
and
with
a
laugh
he
threw
some
coals
on
the
fire
before
turning
down
the
gas
like
a
careful
householder
so
we
went
out
together
as
the
clock
on
the
was
striking
two
ii
piccadilly
was
a
trench
of
raw
white
fog
rimmed
with
blurred
and
lined
with
a
thin
coating
of
adhesive
mud
we
met
no
other
wayfarers
on
the
deserted
flagstones
and
were
ourselves
favored
with
a
very
hard
stare
from
the
constable
of
the
beat
who
however
touched
his
helmet
on
recognizing
my
companion
you
see
i
known
to
the
police
laughed
raffles
as
we
passed
on
poor
devils
they
got
to
keep
their
weather
eye
open
on
a
night
like
this
a
fog
may
be
a
bore
to
you
and
me
bunny
but
it
a
perfect
godsend
to
the
criminal
classes
especially
so
late
in
their
season
here
we
are
though
and
i
hanged
if
the
beggar
is
in
bed
and
asleep
after
all
we
had
turned
into
bond
street
and
had
halted
on
the
curb
a
few
yards
down
on
the
right
raffles
was
gazing
up
at
some
windows
across
the
road
windows
barely
discernible
through
the
mist
and
without
the
glimmer
of
a
light
to
throw
them
out
they
were
over
a
jeweller
shop
as
i
could
see
by
the
in
the
shop
door
and
the
bright
light
burning
within
but
the
entire
upper
part
with
the
private
next
the
shop
was
black
and
blank
as
the
sky
itself
better
give
it
up
for
i
urged
surely
the
morning
will
be
time
enough
not
a
bit
of
it
said
raffles
i
have
his
key
we
surprise
him
come
along
and
seizing
my
right
arm
he
hurried
me
across
the
road
opened
the
door
with
his
and
in
another
moment
had
shut
it
swiftly
but
softly
behind
us
we
stood
together
in
the
dark
outside
a
measured
step
was
approaching
we
had
heard
it
through
the
fog
as
we
crossed
the
street
now
as
it
drew
nearer
my
companion
fingers
tightened
on
my
arm
it
may
be
the
chap
himself
he
whispered
he
the
devil
of
a
not
a
sound
bunny
we
startle
the
life
out
of
him
ah
the
measured
step
had
passed
without
a
pause
raffles
drew
a
deep
breath
and
his
singular
grip
of
me
slowly
relaxed
but
still
not
a
sound
he
continued
in
the
same
whisper
we
take
a
rise
out
of
him
wherever
he
is
slip
off
your
shoes
and
follow
me
well
you
may
wonder
at
my
doing
so
but
you
can
never
have
met
raffles
half
his
power
lay
in
a
conciliating
trick
of
sinking
the
commander
in
the
leader
and
it
was
impossible
not
to
follow
one
who
led
with
such
a
zest
you
might
question
but
you
followed
first
so
now
when
i
heard
him
kick
off
his
own
shoes
i
did
the
same
and
was
on
the
stairs
at
his
heels
before
i
realized
what
an
extraordinary
way
was
this
of
approaching
a
stranger
for
money
in
the
dead
of
night
but
obviously
raffles
and
he
were
on
exceptional
terms
of
intimacy
and
i
could
not
but
infer
that
they
were
in
the
habit
of
playing
practical
jokes
upon
each
other
we
groped
our
way
so
slowly
upstairs
that
i
had
time
to
make
more
than
one
note
before
we
reached
the
top
the
stair
was
uncarpeted
the
spread
fingers
of
my
right
hand
encountered
nothing
on
the
damp
wall
those
of
my
left
trailed
through
a
dust
that
could
be
felt
on
the
banisters
an
eerie
sensation
had
been
upon
me
since
we
entered
the
house
it
increased
with
every
step
we
climbed
what
hermit
were
we
going
to
startle
in
his
cell
we
came
to
a
landing
the
banisters
led
us
to
the
left
and
to
the
left
again
four
steps
more
and
we
were
on
another
and
a
longer
landing
and
suddenly
a
match
blazed
from
the
black
i
never
heard
it
struck
its
flash
was
blinding
when
my
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
light
there
was
raffles
holding
up
the
match
with
one
hand
and
shading
it
with
the
other
between
bare
boards
stripped
walls
and
the
open
doors
of
empty
rooms
where
have
you
brought
me
i
cried
the
house
is
unoccupied
hush
wait
he
whispered
and
he
led
the
way
into
one
of
the
empty
rooms
his
match
went
out
as
we
crossed
the
threshold
and
he
struck
another
without
the
slightest
noise
then
he
stood
with
his
back
to
me
fumbling
with
something
that
i
could
not
see
but
when
he
threw
the
second
match
away
there
was
some
other
light
in
its
stead
and
a
slight
smell
of
oil
i
stepped
forward
to
look
over
his
shoulder
but
before
i
could
do
so
he
had
turned
and
flashed
a
tiny
lantern
in
my
face
what
this
i
gasped
what
rotten
trick
are
you
going
to
play
it
played
he
answered
with
his
quiet
laugh
on
me
i
am
afraid
so
bunny
is
there
no
one
in
the
house
then
no
one
but
ourselves
so
it
was
mere
chaff
about
your
friend
in
bond
street
who
could
let
us
have
that
money
not
altogether
it
quite
true
that
danby
is
a
friend
of
mine
danby
the
jeweller
underneath
what
do
you
mean
i
whispered
trembling
like
a
leaf
as
his
meaning
dawned
upon
me
are
we
to
get
the
money
from
the
jeweller
well
not
exactly
what
then
the
equivalent
from
his
shop
there
was
no
need
for
another
question
i
understood
everything
but
my
own
density
he
had
given
me
a
dozen
hints
and
i
had
taken
none
and
there
i
stood
staring
at
him
in
that
empty
room
and
there
he
stood
with
his
dark
lantern
laughing
at
me
a
burglar
i
gasped
you
you
i
told
you
i
lived
by
my
wits
why
could
you
tell
me
what
you
were
going
to
do
why
could
you
trust
me
why
must
you
lie
i
demanded
piqued
to
the
quick
for
all
my
horror
i
wanted
to
tell
you
said
he
i
was
on
the
point
of
telling
you
more
than
once
you
may
remember
how
i
sounded
you
about
crime
though
you
have
probably
forgotten
what
you
said
yourself
i
did
think
you
meant
it
at
the
time
but
i
thought
i
put
you
to
the
test
now
i
see
you
did
and
i
do
blame
you
i
only
am
to
blame
get
out
of
it
my
dear
boy
as
quick
as
you
can
leave
it
to
me
you
wo
give
me
away
whatever
else
you
do
oh
his
cleverness
his
fiendish
cleverness
had
he
fallen
back
on
threats
coercion
sneers
all
might
have
been
different
even
yet
but
he
set
me
free
to
leave
him
in
the
lurch
he
would
not
blame
me
he
did
not
even
bind
me
to
secrecy
he
trusted
me
he
knew
my
weakness
and
my
strength
and
was
playing
on
both
with
his
master
touch
not
so
fast
said
i
did
i
put
this
into
your
head
or
were
you
going
to
do
it
in
any
case
not
in
any
case
said
raffles
it
true
i
had
the
key
for
days
but
when
i
won
i
thought
of
chucking
it
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
not
a
job
that
settles
it
i
your
man
you
mean
it
yes
for
good
old
bunny
he
murmured
holding
the
lantern
for
one
moment
to
my
face
the
next
he
was
explaining
his
plans
and
i
was
nodding
as
though
we
had
been
all
our
days
i
know
the
shop
he
whispered
because
i
got
a
few
things
there
i
know
this
upper
part
too
it
been
to
let
for
a
month
and
i
got
an
order
to
view
and
took
a
cast
of
the
key
before
using
it
the
one
thing
i
do
know
is
how
to
make
a
connection
between
the
two
at
present
there
none
we
may
make
it
up
here
though
i
rather
fancy
the
basement
myself
if
you
wait
a
minute
i
tell
you
he
set
his
lantern
on
the
floor
crept
to
a
back
window
and
opened
it
with
scarcely
a
sound
only
to
return
shaking
his
head
after
shutting
the
window
with
the
same
care
that
was
our
one
chance
said
he
a
back
window
above
a
back
window
but
it
too
dark
to
see
anything
and
we
dare
show
an
outside
light
come
down
after
me
to
the
basement
and
remember
though
not
a
soul
on
the
premises
you
ca
make
too
little
noise
there
there
listen
to
that
it
was
the
measured
tread
that
we
had
heard
before
on
the
flagstones
outside
raffles
darkened
his
lantern
and
again
we
stood
motionless
till
it
had
passed
either
a
policeman
he
muttered
or
a
watchman
that
all
these
jewellers
run
between
them
the
watchman
the
man
for
us
to
watch
he
simply
paid
to
spot
this
kind
of
thing
we
crept
very
gingerly
down
the
stairs
which
creaked
a
bit
in
spite
of
us
and
we
picked
up
our
shoes
in
the
passage
then
down
some
narrow
stone
steps
at
the
foot
of
which
raffles
showed
his
light
and
put
on
his
shoes
once
more
bidding
me
do
the
same
in
a
rather
louder
tone
than
he
had
permitted
himself
to
employ
overhead
we
were
now
considerably
below
the
level
of
the
street
in
a
small
space
with
as
many
doors
as
it
had
sides
three
were
ajar
and
we
saw
through
them
into
empty
cellars
but
in
the
fourth
a
key
was
turned
and
a
bolt
drawn
and
this
one
presently
let
us
out
into
the
bottom
of
a
deep
square
well
of
fog
a
similar
door
faced
it
across
this
area
and
raffles
had
the
lantern
close
against
it
and
was
hiding
the
light
with
his
body
when
a
short
and
sudden
crash
made
my
heart
stand
still
next
moment
i
saw
the
door
wide
open
and
raffles
standing
within
and
beckoning
me
with
a
jimmy
door
number
one
he
whispered
deuce
knows
how
many
more
be
but
i
know
of
two
at
least
we
wo
have
to
make
much
noise
over
them
either
down
here
there
less
risk
we
were
now
at
the
bottom
of
the
exact
fellow
to
the
narrow
stone
stair
which
we
had
just
descended
the
yard
or
well
being
the
one
part
common
to
both
the
private
and
the
business
premises
but
this
flight
led
to
no
open
passage
instead
a
singularly
solid
mahogany
door
confronted
us
at
the
top
i
thought
so
muttered
raffles
handing
me
the
lantern
and
pocketing
a
bunch
of
skeleton
keys
after
tampering
for
a
few
minutes
with
the
lock
it
be
an
hour
work
to
get
through
that
ca
you
pick
it
no
i
know
these
locks
it
no
use
trying
we
must
cut
it
out
and
it
take
us
an
hour
it
took
us
minutes
by
my
watch
or
rather
it
took
raffles
and
never
in
my
life
have
i
seen
anything
more
deliberately
done
my
part
was
simply
to
stand
by
with
the
dark
lantern
in
one
hand
and
a
small
bottle
of
in
the
other
raffles
had
produced
a
pretty
embroidered
case
intended
obviously
for
his
razors
but
filled
instead
with
the
tools
of
his
secret
trade
including
the
from
this
case
he
selected
a
bit
capable
of
drilling
a
hole
an
inch
in
diameter
and
fitted
it
to
a
small
but
very
strong
steel
brace
then
he
took
off
his
and
his
blazer
spread
them
neatly
on
the
top
step
knelt
on
them
turned
up
his
shirt
cuffs
and
went
to
work
with
near
the
but
first
he
oiled
the
bit
to
minimize
the
noise
and
this
he
did
invariably
before
beginning
a
fresh
hole
and
often
in
the
middle
of
one
it
took
separate
borings
to
cut
around
that
lock
i
noticed
that
through
the
first
circular
orifice
raffles
thrust
a
forefinger
then
as
the
circle
became
an
oval
he
got
his
hand
through
up
to
the
thumb
and
i
heard
him
swear
softly
to
himself
i
was
afraid
so
what
is
it
an
iron
gate
on
the
other
side
how
on
earth
are
we
to
get
through
that
i
asked
in
dismay
pick
the
lock
but
there
may
be
two
in
that
case
they
be
top
and
bottom
and
we
shall
have
two
fresh
holes
to
make
as
the
door
opens
inwards
it
wo
open
two
inches
as
it
is
i
confess
i
did
not
feel
sanguine
about
the
seeing
that
one
lock
had
baffled
us
already
and
my
disappointment
and
impatience
must
have
been
a
revelation
to
me
had
i
stopped
to
think
the
truth
is
that
i
was
entering
into
our
nefarious
undertaking
with
an
involuntary
zeal
of
which
i
was
myself
quite
unconscious
at
the
time
the
romance
and
the
peril
of
the
whole
proceeding
held
me
spellbound
and
entranced
my
moral
sense
and
my
sense
of
fear
were
stricken
by
a
common
paralysis
and
there
i
stood
shining
my
light
and
holding
my
phial
with
a
keener
interest
than
i
had
ever
brought
to
any
honest
avocation
and
there
knelt
raffles
with
his
black
hair
tumbled
and
the
same
watchful
quiet
determined
with
which
i
have
seen
him
send
down
over
after
over
in
a
county
match
at
last
the
chain
of
holes
was
complete
the
lock
wrenched
out
bodily
and
a
splendid
bare
arm
plunged
up
to
the
shoulder
through
the
aperture
and
through
the
bars
of
the
iron
gate
beyond
now
whispered
raffles
if
there
only
one
lock
it
be
in
the
middle
joy
here
it
is
only
let
me
pick
it
and
we
through
at
last
he
withdrew
his
arm
a
skeleton
key
was
selected
from
the
bunch
and
then
back
went
his
arm
to
the
shoulder
it
was
a
breathless
moment
i
heard
the
heart
throbbing
in
my
body
the
very
watch
ticking
in
my
pocket
and
ever
and
anon
the
of
the
skeleton
key
then
at
last
there
came
a
single
unmistakable
click
in
another
minute
the
mahogany
door
and
the
iron
gate
yawned
behind
us
and
raffles
was
sitting
on
an
office
table
wiping
his
face
with
the
lantern
throwing
a
steady
beam
by
his
side
we
were
now
in
a
bare
and
roomy
lobby
behind
the
shop
but
separated
therefrom
by
an
iron
curtain
the
very
sight
of
which
filled
me
with
despair
raffles
however
did
not
appear
in
the
least
depressed
but
hung
up
his
coat
and
hat
on
some
pegs
in
the
lobby
before
examining
this
curtain
with
his
lantern
that
nothing
said
he
after
a
minute
inspection
we
be
through
that
in
no
time
but
there
a
door
on
the
other
side
which
may
give
us
trouble
another
door
i
groaned
and
how
do
you
mean
to
tackle
this
thing
prise
it
up
with
the
jointed
jimmy
the
weak
point
of
these
iron
curtains
is
the
leverage
you
can
get
from
below
but
it
makes
a
noise
and
this
is
where
you
coming
in
bunny
this
is
where
i
could
do
without
you
i
must
have
you
overhead
to
knock
through
when
the
street
clear
i
come
with
you
and
show
a
light
well
you
may
imagine
how
little
i
liked
the
prospect
of
this
lonely
vigil
and
yet
there
was
something
very
stimulating
in
the
vital
responsibility
which
it
involved
hitherto
i
had
been
a
mere
spectator
now
i
was
to
take
part
in
the
game
and
the
fresh
excitement
made
me
more
than
ever
insensible
to
those
considerations
of
conscience
and
of
safety
which
were
already
as
dead
nerves
in
my
breast
so
i
took
my
post
without
a
murmur
in
the
front
room
above
the
shop
the
fixtures
had
been
left
for
the
refusal
of
the
incoming
tenant
and
fortunately
for
us
they
included
venetian
blinds
which
were
already
down
it
was
the
simplest
matter
in
the
world
to
stand
peeping
through
the
laths
into
the
street
to
beat
twice
with
my
foot
when
anybody
was
approaching
and
once
when
all
was
clear
again
the
noises
that
even
i
could
hear
below
with
the
exception
of
one
metallic
crash
at
the
beginning
were
indeed
incredibly
slight
but
they
ceased
altogether
at
each
double
rap
from
my
toe
and
a
policeman
passed
quite
half
a
dozen
times
beneath
my
eyes
and
the
man
whom
i
took
to
be
the
watchman
oftener
still
during
the
better
part
of
an
hour
that
i
spent
at
the
window
once
indeed
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
but
only
once
it
was
when
the
watchman
stopped
and
peered
through
the
into
the
lighted
shop
i
waited
for
his
whistle
i
waited
for
the
gallows
or
the
gaol
but
my
signals
had
been
studiously
obeyed
and
the
man
passed
on
in
undisturbed
serenity
in
the
end
i
had
a
signal
in
my
turn
and
retraced
my
steps
with
lighted
matches
down
the
broad
stairs
down
the
narrow
ones
across
the
area
and
up
into
the
lobby
where
raffles
awaited
me
with
an
outstretched
hand
well
done
my
boy
said
he
you
the
same
good
man
in
a
pinch
and
you
shall
have
your
reward
i
got
a
thousand
pounds
worth
if
i
got
a
it
all
in
my
pockets
and
here
something
else
i
found
in
this
locker
very
decent
port
and
some
cigars
meant
for
poor
dear
danby
business
friends
take
a
pull
and
you
shall
light
up
presently
i
found
a
lavatory
too
and
we
must
have
a
before
we
go
for
i
as
black
as
your
boot
the
iron
curtain
was
down
but
he
insisted
on
raising
it
until
i
could
peep
through
the
glass
door
on
the
other
side
and
see
his
handiwork
in
the
shop
beyond
here
two
electric
lights
were
left
burning
all
night
long
and
in
their
cold
white
rays
i
could
at
first
see
nothing
amiss
i
looked
along
an
orderly
lane
an
empty
glass
counter
on
my
left
glass
cupboards
of
untouched
silver
on
my
right
and
facing
me
the
filmy
black
eye
of
the
that
shone
like
a
stage
moon
on
the
street
the
counter
had
not
been
emptied
by
raffles
its
contents
were
in
the
chubb
safe
which
he
had
given
up
at
a
glance
nor
had
he
looked
at
the
silver
except
to
choose
a
cigarette
case
for
me
he
had
confined
himself
entirely
to
the
shop
window
this
was
in
three
compartments
each
secured
for
the
night
by
removable
panels
with
separate
locks
raffles
had
removed
them
a
few
hours
before
their
time
and
the
electric
light
shone
on
a
corrugated
shutter
bare
as
the
ribs
of
an
empty
carcase
every
article
of
value
was
gone
from
the
one
place
which
was
invisible
from
the
little
window
in
the
door
elsewhere
all
was
as
it
had
been
left
overnight
and
but
for
a
train
of
mangled
doors
behind
the
iron
curtain
a
bottle
of
wine
and
a
with
which
liberties
had
been
taken
a
rather
black
towel
in
the
lavatory
a
burnt
match
here
and
there
and
our
on
the
dusty
banisters
not
a
trace
of
our
visit
did
we
leave
had
it
in
my
head
for
long
said
raffles
as
we
strolled
through
the
streets
towards
dawn
for
all
the
world
as
though
we
were
returning
from
a
dance
no
bunny
i
never
thought
of
it
till
i
saw
that
upper
part
empty
about
a
month
ago
and
bought
a
few
things
in
the
shop
to
get
the
lie
of
the
land
that
reminds
me
that
i
never
paid
for
them
but
by
jove
i
will
and
if
that
is
poetic
justice
what
is
one
visit
showed
me
the
possibilities
of
the
place
but
a
second
convinced
me
of
its
impossibilities
without
a
pal
so
i
had
practically
given
up
the
idea
when
you
came
along
on
the
very
night
and
in
the
very
plight
for
it
but
here
we
are
at
the
albany
and
i
hope
there
some
fire
left
for
i
do
know
how
you
feel
bunny
but
for
my
part
i
as
cold
as
keats
owl
he
could
think
of
keats
on
his
way
from
a
felony
he
could
hanker
for
his
fireside
like
another
floodgates
were
loosed
within
me
and
the
plain
english
of
our
adventure
rushed
over
me
as
cold
as
ice
raffles
was
a
burglar
i
had
helped
him
to
commit
one
burglary
therefore
i
was
a
burglar
too
yet
i
could
stand
and
warm
myself
by
his
fire
and
watch
him
empty
his
pockets
as
though
we
had
done
nothing
wonderful
or
wicked
my
blood
froze
my
heart
sickened
my
brain
whirled
how
i
had
liked
this
villain
how
i
had
admired
him
now
my
liking
and
admiration
must
turn
to
loathing
and
disgust
i
waited
for
the
change
i
longed
to
feel
it
in
my
heart
but
i
longed
and
i
waited
in
vain
i
saw
that
he
was
emptying
his
pockets
the
table
sparkled
with
their
hoard
rings
by
the
dozen
diamonds
by
the
score
bracelets
pendants
aigrettes
necklaces
pearls
rubies
amethysts
sapphires
and
diamonds
always
diamonds
in
everything
flashing
bayonets
of
light
dazzling
me
blinding
me
making
me
disbelieve
because
i
could
no
longer
forget
last
of
all
came
no
gem
indeed
but
my
own
revolver
from
an
inner
pocket
and
that
struck
a
chord
i
suppose
i
said
something
my
hand
flew
out
i
can
see
raffles
now
as
he
looked
at
me
once
more
with
a
high
arch
over
each
clear
eye
i
can
see
him
pick
out
the
cartridges
with
his
quiet
cynical
smile
before
he
would
give
me
my
pistol
back
again
you
may
believe
it
bunny
said
he
but
i
never
carried
a
loaded
one
before
on
the
whole
i
think
it
gives
one
confidence
yet
it
would
be
very
awkward
if
anything
went
wrong
one
might
use
it
and
that
not
the
game
at
all
though
i
have
often
thought
that
the
murderer
who
has
just
done
the
trick
must
have
great
sensations
before
things
get
too
hot
for
him
do
look
so
distressed
my
dear
chap
i
never
had
those
sensations
and
i
do
suppose
i
ever
shall
but
this
much
you
have
done
before
said
i
hoarsely
before
my
dear
bunny
you
offend
me
did
it
look
like
a
first
attempt
of
course
i
have
done
it
before
often
well
no
not
often
enough
to
destroy
the
charm
at
all
events
never
as
a
matter
of
fact
unless
i
cursedly
hard
up
did
you
hear
about
the
thimbleby
diamonds
well
that
was
the
last
time
and
a
poor
lot
of
paste
they
were
then
there
was
the
little
business
of
the
dormer
at
henley
last
year
that
was
mine
also
such
as
it
was
i
never
brought
off
a
really
big
coup
yet
when
i
do
i
shall
chuck
it
up
yes
i
remembered
both
cases
very
well
to
think
that
he
was
their
author
it
was
incredible
outrageous
inconceivable
then
my
eyes
would
fall
upon
the
table
twinkling
and
glittering
in
a
hundred
places
and
incredulity
was
at
an
end
how
came
you
to
begin
i
asked
as
curiosity
overcame
mere
wonder
and
a
fascination
for
his
career
gradually
wove
itself
into
my
fascination
for
the
man
ah
that
a
long
story
said
raffles
it
was
in
the
colonies
when
i
was
out
there
playing
cricket
it
too
long
a
story
to
tell
you
now
but
i
was
in
much
the
same
fix
that
you
were
in
and
it
was
my
only
way
out
i
never
meant
it
for
anything
more
but
tasted
blood
and
it
was
all
over
with
me
why
should
i
work
when
i
could
steal
why
settle
down
to
some
humdrum
uncongenial
billet
when
excitement
romance
danger
and
a
decent
living
were
all
going
begging
together
of
course
it
very
wrong
but
we
ca
all
be
moralists
and
the
distribution
of
wealth
is
very
wrong
to
begin
with
besides
you
not
at
it
all
the
time
i
sick
of
quoting
gilbert
lines
to
myself
but
they
profoundly
true
i
only
wonder
if
you
like
the
life
as
much
as
i
do
like
it
i
cried
out
not
i
it
no
life
for
me
once
is
enough
you
would
give
me
a
hand
another
time
do
ask
me
raffles
do
ask
me
for
god
sake
yet
you
said
you
would
do
anything
for
me
you
asked
me
to
name
my
crime
but
i
knew
at
the
time
you
did
mean
it
you
did
go
back
on
me
and
that
ought
to
satisfy
me
goodness
knows
i
suppose
i
ungrateful
and
unreasonable
and
all
that
i
ought
to
let
it
end
at
this
but
you
the
very
man
for
me
bunny
the
very
man
just
think
how
we
got
through
not
a
scratch
not
a
hitch
there
nothing
very
terrible
in
it
you
see
there
never
would
be
while
we
worked
together
he
was
standing
in
front
of
me
with
a
hand
on
either
shoulder
he
was
smiling
as
he
knew
so
well
how
to
smile
i
turned
on
my
heel
planted
my
elbows
on
the
and
my
burning
head
between
my
hands
next
instant
a
still
heartier
hand
had
fallen
on
my
back
all
right
my
boy
you
are
quite
right
and
i
worse
than
wrong
i
never
ask
it
again
go
if
you
want
to
and
come
again
about
for
the
cash
there
was
no
bargain
but
of
course
i
get
you
out
of
your
scrape
especially
after
the
way
you
stood
by
me
i
was
round
again
with
my
blood
on
fire
i
do
it
again
i
said
through
my
teeth
he
shook
his
head
not
you
he
said
smiling
quite
on
my
insane
enthusiasm
i
will
i
cried
with
an
oath
i
lend
you
a
hand
as
often
as
you
like
what
does
it
matter
now
i
been
in
it
once
i
be
in
it
again
i
gone
to
the
devil
anyhow
i
ca
go
back
and
if
i
could
nothing
matters
another
rap
when
you
want
me
i
your
man
and
that
is
how
raffles
and
i
joined
felonious
forces
on
the
ides
of
march
a
costume
piece
london
was
just
then
talking
of
one
whose
name
is
already
a
name
and
nothing
more
reuben
rosenthall
had
made
his
millions
on
the
diamond
fields
of
south
africa
and
had
come
home
to
enjoy
them
according
to
his
lights
how
he
went
to
work
will
scarcely
be
forgotten
by
any
reader
of
the
halfpenny
evening
papers
which
revelled
in
endless
anecdotes
of
his
original
indigence
and
present
prodigality
varied
with
interesting
particulars
of
the
extraordinary
establishment
which
the
millionaire
set
up
in
john
wood
here
he
kept
a
retinue
of
kaffirs
who
were
literally
his
slaves
and
hence
he
would
sally
with
enormous
diamonds
in
his
shirt
and
on
his
finger
in
the
convoy
of
a
of
heinous
repute
who
was
not
however
by
any
means
the
worst
element
in
the
rosenthall
melange
so
said
common
gossip
but
the
fact
was
sufficiently
established
by
the
interference
of
the
police
on
at
least
one
occasion
followed
by
certain
magisterial
proceedings
which
were
reported
with
justifiable
gusto
and
huge
headlines
in
the
newspapers
aforesaid
and
this
was
all
one
knew
of
reuben
rosenthall
up
to
the
time
when
the
old
bohemian
club
having
fallen
on
evil
days
found
it
worth
its
while
to
organize
a
great
dinner
in
honor
of
so
wealthy
an
exponent
of
the
club
principles
i
was
not
at
the
banquet
myself
but
a
member
took
raffles
who
told
me
all
about
it
that
very
night
most
extraordinary
show
i
ever
went
to
in
my
life
said
he
as
for
the
man
himself
well
i
was
prepared
for
something
grotesque
but
the
fellow
fairly
took
my
breath
away
to
begin
with
he
the
most
astounding
brute
to
look
at
well
over
six
feet
with
a
chest
like
a
barrel
and
a
great
and
the
reddest
hair
and
whiskers
you
ever
saw
drank
like
a
but
only
got
drunk
enough
to
make
us
a
speech
that
i
would
have
missed
for
ten
pounds
i
only
sorry
you
were
there
too
bunny
old
chap
i
began
to
be
sorry
myself
for
raffles
was
anything
but
an
excitable
person
and
never
had
i
seen
him
so
excited
before
had
he
been
following
rosenthall
example
his
coming
to
my
rooms
at
midnight
merely
to
tell
me
about
his
dinner
was
in
itself
enough
to
excuse
a
suspicion
which
was
certainly
at
variance
with
my
knowledge
of
raffles
what
did
he
say
i
inquired
mechanically
divining
some
subtler
explanation
of
this
visit
and
wondering
what
on
earth
it
could
be
say
cried
raffles
what
did
he
not
say
he
boasted
of
his
rise
he
bragged
of
his
riches
and
he
blackguarded
society
for
taking
him
up
for
his
money
and
dropping
him
out
of
sheer
pique
and
jealousy
because
he
had
so
much
he
mentioned
names
too
with
the
most
charming
freedom
and
swore
he
was
as
good
a
man
as
the
old
country
had
to
show
pace
the
old
bohemians
to
prove
it
he
pointed
to
a
great
diamond
in
the
middle
of
his
with
a
little
finger
loaded
with
another
just
like
it
which
of
our
bloated
princes
could
show
a
pair
like
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
seemed
quite
wonderful
stones
with
a
curious
purple
gleam
to
them
that
must
mean
a
pot
of
money
but
old
rosenthall
swore
he
would
take
fifty
thousand
pounds
for
the
two
and
wanted
to
know
where
the
other
man
was
who
went
about
with
thousand
in
his
and
another
on
his
little
finger
he
did
exist
if
he
did
he
would
have
the
pluck
to
wear
them
but
he
had
he
tell
us
why
and
before
you
could
say
jack
robinson
he
had
whipped
out
a
whacking
great
revolver
not
at
the
table
at
the
table
in
the
middle
of
his
speech
but
it
was
nothing
to
what
he
wanted
to
do
he
actually
wanted
us
to
let
him
write
his
name
in
bullets
on
the
opposite
wall
to
show
us
why
he
was
afraid
to
go
about
in
all
his
diamonds
that
brute
purvis
the
who
is
his
paid
bully
had
to
bully
his
master
before
he
could
be
persuaded
out
of
it
there
was
quite
a
panic
for
the
moment
one
fellow
was
saying
his
prayers
under
the
table
and
the
waiters
bolted
to
a
man
what
a
grotesque
scene
grotesque
enough
but
i
rather
wish
they
had
let
him
go
the
whole
hog
and
blaze
away
he
was
as
keen
as
knives
to
show
us
how
he
could
take
care
of
his
purple
diamonds
and
do
you
know
bunny
was
as
keen
as
knives
to
see
and
raffles
leaned
towards
me
with
a
sly
slow
smile
that
made
the
hidden
meaning
of
his
visit
only
too
plain
to
me
at
last
so
you
think
of
having
a
try
for
his
diamonds
yourself
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
is
horribly
obvious
i
admit
but
yes
i
have
set
my
heart
upon
them
to
be
quite
frank
i
have
had
them
on
my
conscience
for
some
time
one
could
hear
so
much
of
the
man
and
his
and
his
diamonds
without
feeling
it
a
kind
of
duty
to
have
a
go
for
them
but
when
it
comes
to
brandishing
a
revolver
and
practically
challenging
the
world
the
thing
becomes
inevitable
it
is
simply
thrust
upon
one
i
was
fated
to
hear
that
challenge
bunny
and
i
for
one
must
take
it
up
i
was
only
sorry
i
could
get
on
my
hind
legs
and
say
so
then
and
there
well
i
said
i
do
see
the
necessity
as
things
are
with
us
but
of
course
i
your
man
my
tone
may
have
been
i
did
my
best
to
make
it
otherwise
but
it
was
barely
a
month
since
our
bond
street
exploit
and
we
certainly
could
have
afforded
to
behave
ourselves
for
some
time
to
come
we
had
been
getting
along
so
nicely
by
his
advice
i
had
scribbled
a
thing
or
two
inspired
by
raffles
i
had
even
done
an
article
on
our
own
jewel
robbery
and
for
the
moment
i
was
quite
satisfied
with
this
sort
of
adventure
i
thought
we
ought
to
know
when
we
were
well
off
and
could
see
no
point
in
our
running
fresh
risks
before
we
were
obliged
on
the
other
hand
i
was
anxious
not
to
show
the
least
disposition
to
break
the
pledge
that
i
had
given
a
month
ago
but
it
was
not
on
my
manifest
disinclination
that
raffles
fastened
necessity
my
dear
bunny
does
the
writer
only
write
when
the
wolf
is
at
the
door
does
the
painter
paint
for
bread
alone
must
you
and
i
be
driven
to
crime
like
tom
of
bow
and
dick
of
whitechapel
you
pain
me
my
dear
chap
you
need
laugh
because
you
do
art
for
sake
is
a
vile
catchword
but
i
confess
it
appeals
to
me
in
this
case
my
motives
are
absolutely
pure
for
i
doubt
if
we
shall
ever
be
able
to
dispose
of
such
peculiar
stones
but
if
i
do
have
a
try
for
them
after
i
shall
never
be
able
to
hold
up
my
head
again
his
eye
twinkled
but
it
glittered
too
we
shall
have
our
work
cut
out
was
all
i
said
and
do
you
suppose
i
should
be
keen
on
it
if
we
had
cried
raffles
my
dear
fellow
i
would
rob
paul
cathedral
if
i
could
but
i
could
no
more
scoop
a
till
when
the
shopwalker
was
looking
than
i
could
bag
the
apples
out
of
an
old
woman
basket
even
that
little
business
last
month
was
a
sordid
affair
but
it
was
necessary
and
i
think
its
strategy
redeemed
it
to
some
extent
now
there
some
credit
and
more
sport
in
going
where
they
boast
they
on
their
guard
against
you
the
bank
of
england
for
example
is
the
ideal
crib
but
that
would
need
half
a
dozen
of
us
with
years
to
give
to
the
job
and
meanwhile
reuben
rosenthall
is
high
enough
game
for
you
and
me
we
know
he
armed
we
know
how
billy
purvis
can
fight
it
be
no
soft
thing
i
grant
you
but
what
of
that
my
good
bunny
what
of
that
a
man
reach
must
exceed
his
grasp
dear
boy
or
what
the
dickens
is
a
heaven
for
i
would
rather
we
did
exceed
ours
just
yet
i
answered
laughing
for
his
spirit
was
irresistible
and
the
plan
was
growing
upon
me
despite
my
qualms
trust
me
for
that
was
his
reply
i
see
you
through
after
all
i
expect
to
find
that
the
difficulties
are
nearly
all
on
the
surface
these
fellows
both
drink
like
the
devil
and
that
should
simplify
matters
considerably
but
we
shall
see
and
we
must
take
our
time
there
will
probably
turn
out
to
be
a
dozen
different
ways
in
which
the
thing
might
be
done
and
we
shall
have
to
choose
between
them
it
will
mean
watching
the
house
for
at
least
a
week
in
any
case
it
may
mean
lots
of
other
things
that
will
take
much
longer
but
give
me
a
week
and
i
will
tell
you
more
that
to
say
if
you
really
on
of
course
i
am
i
replied
indignantly
but
why
should
i
give
you
a
week
why
should
we
watch
the
house
together
because
two
eyes
are
as
good
as
four
and
take
up
less
room
never
hunt
in
couples
unless
you
obliged
but
do
you
look
offended
bunny
there
be
plenty
for
you
to
do
when
the
time
comes
that
i
promise
you
you
shall
have
your
share
of
the
fun
never
fear
and
a
purple
diamond
all
to
yourself
if
we
lucky
on
the
whole
however
this
conversation
left
me
less
than
lukewarm
and
i
still
remember
the
depression
which
came
upon
me
when
raffles
was
gone
i
saw
the
folly
of
the
enterprise
to
which
i
had
committed
myself
the
sheer
gratuitous
unnecessary
folly
of
it
and
the
paradoxes
in
which
raffles
revelled
and
the
frivolous
casuistry
which
was
nevertheless
half
sincere
and
which
his
mere
personality
rendered
wholly
plausible
at
the
moment
of
utterance
appealed
very
little
to
me
when
recalled
in
cold
blood
i
admired
the
spirit
of
pure
mischief
in
which
he
seemed
prepared
to
risk
his
liberty
and
his
life
but
i
did
not
find
it
an
infectious
spirit
on
calm
reflection
yet
the
thought
of
withdrawal
was
not
to
be
entertained
for
a
moment
on
the
contrary
i
was
impatient
of
the
delay
ordained
by
raffles
and
perhaps
no
small
part
of
my
secret
disaffection
came
of
his
galling
determination
to
do
without
me
until
the
last
moment
it
made
it
no
better
that
this
was
characteristic
of
the
man
and
of
his
attitude
towards
me
for
a
month
we
had
been
i
suppose
the
thickest
thieves
in
all
london
and
yet
our
intimacy
was
curiously
incomplete
with
all
his
charming
frankness
there
was
in
raffles
a
vein
of
capricious
reserve
which
was
perceptible
enough
to
be
very
irritating
he
had
the
instinctive
secretiveness
of
the
inveterate
criminal
he
would
make
mysteries
of
matters
of
common
concern
for
example
i
never
knew
how
or
where
he
disposed
of
the
bond
street
jewels
on
the
proceeds
of
which
we
were
both
still
leading
the
outward
lives
of
hundreds
of
other
young
fellows
about
town
he
was
consistently
mysterious
about
that
and
other
details
of
which
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
already
earned
the
right
to
know
everything
i
could
not
but
remember
how
he
had
led
me
into
my
first
felony
by
means
of
a
trick
while
yet
uncertain
whether
he
could
trust
me
or
not
that
i
could
no
longer
afford
to
resent
but
i
did
resent
his
want
of
confidence
in
me
now
i
said
nothing
about
it
but
it
rankled
every
day
and
never
more
than
in
the
week
that
succeeded
the
rosenthall
dinner
when
i
met
raffles
at
the
club
he
would
tell
me
nothing
when
i
went
to
his
rooms
he
was
out
or
pretended
to
be
one
day
he
told
me
he
was
getting
on
well
but
slowly
it
was
a
more
ticklish
game
than
he
had
thought
but
when
i
began
to
ask
questions
he
would
say
no
more
then
and
there
in
my
annoyance
i
took
my
own
decision
since
he
would
tell
me
nothing
of
the
result
of
his
vigils
i
determined
to
keep
one
on
my
own
account
and
that
very
evening
found
my
way
to
the
millionaire
front
gates
the
house
he
was
occupying
is
i
believe
quite
the
largest
in
the
john
wood
district
it
stands
in
the
angle
formed
by
two
broad
thoroughfares
neither
of
which
as
it
happens
is
a
route
and
i
doubt
if
many
quieter
spots
exist
within
the
radius
quiet
also
was
the
great
square
house
in
its
garden
of
and
shrubs
the
lights
were
low
the
millionaire
and
his
friends
obviously
spending
their
evening
elsewhere
the
garden
walls
were
only
a
few
feet
high
in
one
there
was
a
side
door
opening
into
a
glass
passage
in
the
other
two
gates
one
at
either
end
of
the
little
drive
and
both
wide
open
so
still
was
the
place
that
i
had
a
great
mind
to
walk
boldly
in
and
learn
something
of
the
premises
in
fact
i
was
on
the
point
of
doing
so
when
i
heard
a
quick
shuffling
step
on
the
pavement
behind
me
i
turned
round
and
faced
the
dark
scowl
and
the
dirty
clenched
fists
of
a
dilapidated
tramp
you
fool
said
he
you
utter
idiot
raffles
that
it
he
whispered
savagely
tell
all
the
neighborhood
give
me
away
at
the
top
of
your
voice
with
that
he
turned
his
back
upon
me
and
shambled
down
the
road
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
muttering
to
himself
as
though
i
had
refused
him
alms
a
few
moments
i
stood
astounded
indignant
at
a
loss
then
i
followed
him
his
feet
trailed
his
knees
gave
his
back
was
bowed
his
head
kept
nodding
it
was
the
gait
of
a
man
eighty
years
of
age
presently
he
waited
for
me
midway
between
two
as
i
came
up
he
was
lighting
rank
tobacco
in
a
cutty
pipe
with
an
match
and
the
flame
showed
me
the
suspicion
of
a
smile
you
must
forgive
my
heat
bunny
but
it
really
was
very
foolish
of
you
here
am
i
trying
every
dodge
begging
at
the
door
one
night
hiding
in
the
shrubs
the
next
doing
every
mortal
thing
but
stand
and
stare
at
the
house
as
you
went
and
did
it
a
costume
piece
and
in
you
rush
in
your
ordinary
clothes
i
tell
you
they
on
the
lookout
for
us
night
and
day
it
the
toughest
nut
i
ever
tackled
well
said
i
if
you
had
told
me
so
before
i
should
have
come
you
told
me
nothing
he
looked
hard
at
me
from
under
the
broken
brim
of
a
battered
billycock
you
right
he
said
at
length
i
been
too
close
it
become
second
nature
with
me
when
i
anything
on
but
here
an
end
of
it
bunny
so
far
as
you
concerned
i
going
home
now
and
i
want
you
to
follow
me
but
for
heaven
sake
keep
your
distance
and
do
speak
to
me
again
till
i
speak
to
you
there
give
me
a
start
and
he
was
off
again
a
decrepit
vagabond
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
elbows
squared
and
frayed
swinging
raggedly
from
side
to
side
i
followed
him
to
the
finchley
road
there
he
took
an
atlas
omnibus
and
i
sat
some
rows
behind
him
on
the
top
but
not
far
enough
to
escape
the
pest
of
his
vile
tobacco
that
he
could
carry
his
to
such
a
pitch
he
who
would
only
smoke
one
brand
of
cigarette
it
was
the
last
least
touch
of
the
insatiable
artist
and
it
charmed
away
what
mortification
there
still
remained
in
me
once
more
i
felt
the
fascination
of
a
comrade
who
was
forever
dazzling
one
with
a
fresh
and
unsuspected
facet
of
his
character
as
we
neared
piccadilly
i
wondered
what
he
would
do
surely
he
was
not
going
into
the
albany
like
that
no
he
took
another
omnibus
to
sloane
street
i
sitting
behind
him
as
before
at
sloane
street
we
changed
again
and
were
presently
in
the
long
lean
artery
of
the
king
road
i
was
now
all
agog
to
know
our
destination
nor
was
i
kept
many
more
minutes
in
doubt
raffles
got
down
i
followed
he
crossed
the
road
and
disappeared
up
a
dark
turning
i
pressed
after
him
and
was
in
time
to
see
his
as
he
plunged
into
a
still
darker
flagged
alley
to
the
right
he
was
holding
himself
up
and
stepping
out
like
a
young
man
once
more
also
in
some
subtle
way
he
already
looked
less
disreputable
but
i
alone
was
there
to
see
him
the
alley
was
absolutely
deserted
and
desperately
dark
at
the
further
end
he
opened
a
door
with
a
and
it
was
darker
yet
within
instinctively
i
drew
back
and
heard
him
chuckle
we
could
no
longer
see
each
other
all
right
bunny
there
no
this
time
these
are
studios
my
friend
and
i
one
of
the
lawful
tenants
indeed
in
another
minute
we
were
in
a
lofty
room
with
skylight
easels
platform
and
every
other
adjunct
save
the
signs
of
actual
labor
the
first
thing
i
saw
as
raffles
lit
the
gas
was
its
reflection
in
his
silk
hat
on
the
pegs
beside
the
rest
of
his
normal
garments
looking
for
the
works
of
art
continued
raffles
lighting
a
cigarette
and
beginning
to
divest
himself
of
his
rags
i
afraid
you
find
any
but
there
the
canvas
i
always
going
to
make
a
start
upon
i
tell
them
i
looking
high
and
low
for
my
ideal
model
i
have
the
stove
lit
on
principle
twice
a
week
and
look
in
and
leave
a
newspaper
and
a
smell
of
sullivans
how
good
they
are
after
shag
meanwhile
i
pay
my
rent
and
am
a
good
tenant
in
every
way
and
it
a
very
useful
little
there
no
saying
how
useful
it
might
be
at
a
pinch
as
it
is
the
comes
in
and
the
topper
goes
out
and
nobody
takes
the
slightest
notice
of
either
at
this
time
of
night
the
chances
are
that
there
not
a
soul
in
the
building
except
ourselves
you
never
told
me
you
went
in
for
disguises
said
i
watching
him
as
he
cleansed
the
grime
from
his
face
and
hands
no
bunny
i
treated
you
very
shabbily
all
round
there
was
really
no
reason
why
i
should
have
shown
you
this
place
a
month
ago
and
yet
there
was
no
point
in
my
doing
so
and
circumstances
are
just
conceivable
in
which
it
would
have
suited
us
both
for
you
to
be
in
genuine
ignorance
of
my
whereabouts
i
have
something
to
sleep
on
as
you
perceive
in
case
of
need
and
of
course
my
name
is
not
raffles
in
the
king
road
so
you
will
see
that
one
might
bolt
further
and
fare
worse
meanwhile
you
use
the
place
as
a
it
is
my
private
pavilion
said
raffles
disguises
in
some
cases
they
half
the
battle
and
it
always
pleasant
to
feel
that
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
you
need
necessarily
be
convicted
under
your
own
name
then
they
indispensable
in
dealing
with
the
fences
i
drive
all
my
bargains
in
the
tongue
and
raiment
of
shoreditch
if
i
did
there
be
the
very
devil
to
pay
in
blackmail
now
this
cupboard
full
of
all
sorts
of
toggery
i
tell
the
woman
who
cleans
the
room
that
it
for
my
models
when
i
find
by
the
way
i
only
hope
i
got
something
that
fit
you
for
you
want
a
rig
for
night
night
i
exclaimed
why
what
do
you
mean
to
do
the
trick
said
raffles
i
intended
writing
to
you
as
soon
as
i
got
back
to
my
rooms
to
ask
you
to
look
me
up
afternoon
then
i
was
going
to
unfold
my
plan
of
campaign
and
take
you
straight
into
action
then
and
there
there
nothing
like
putting
the
nervous
players
in
first
it
the
sitting
with
their
pads
on
that
upsets
their
applecart
that
was
another
of
my
reasons
for
being
so
confoundedly
close
you
must
try
to
forgive
me
i
could
help
remembering
how
well
you
played
up
last
trip
without
any
time
to
weaken
on
it
beforehand
all
i
want
is
for
you
to
be
as
cool
and
smart
night
as
you
were
then
though
by
jove
there
no
comparison
between
the
two
cases
i
thought
you
would
find
it
so
you
were
right
i
have
mind
you
i
do
say
this
will
be
the
tougher
job
all
round
we
shall
probably
get
in
without
any
difficulty
at
all
it
the
getting
out
again
that
may
flummox
us
that
the
worst
of
an
irregular
household
cried
raffles
with
quite
a
burst
of
virtuous
indignation
i
assure
you
bunny
i
spent
the
whole
of
monday
night
in
the
shrubbery
of
the
garden
next
door
looking
over
the
wall
and
if
you
believe
me
somebody
was
about
all
night
long
i
do
mean
the
kaffirs
i
do
believe
they
ever
get
to
bed
at
all
poor
devils
no
i
mean
rosenthall
himself
and
that
beast
purvis
they
were
up
and
drinking
from
midnight
when
they
came
in
to
broad
daylight
when
i
cleared
out
even
then
i
left
them
sober
enough
to
slang
each
other
by
the
way
they
very
nearly
came
to
blows
in
the
garden
within
a
few
yards
of
me
and
i
heard
something
that
might
come
in
useful
and
make
rosenthall
shoot
crooked
at
a
critical
moment
you
know
what
an
b
is
illicit
diamond
buyer
exactly
well
it
seems
that
rosenthall
was
one
he
must
have
let
it
out
to
purvis
in
his
cups
anyhow
i
heard
purvis
taunting
him
with
it
and
threatening
him
with
the
breakwater
at
capetown
and
i
begin
to
think
our
friends
are
friend
and
foe
but
about
night
there
nothing
subtle
in
my
plan
it
simply
to
get
in
while
these
fellows
are
out
on
the
loose
and
to
lie
low
till
they
come
back
and
longer
if
possible
we
must
doctor
the
whiskey
that
would
simplify
the
whole
thing
though
it
not
a
very
sporting
game
to
play
still
we
must
remember
rosenthall
revolver
we
do
want
him
to
sign
his
name
on
us
with
all
those
kaffirs
about
however
it
ten
to
one
on
the
whiskey
and
a
hundred
to
one
against
us
if
we
go
looking
for
it
a
brush
with
the
heathen
would
spoil
everything
if
it
did
no
more
besides
there
are
the
ladies
the
deuce
there
are
ladies
with
an
and
the
very
voices
for
raising
cain
i
fear
i
fear
the
clamor
it
would
be
fatal
to
us
au
contraire
if
we
can
manage
to
stow
ourselves
away
unbeknownst
half
the
battle
will
be
won
if
rosenthall
turns
in
drunk
it
a
purple
diamond
apiece
if
he
sits
up
sober
it
may
be
a
bullet
instead
we
will
hope
not
bunny
and
all
the
firing
would
be
on
one
side
but
it
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
and
so
we
left
it
when
we
shook
hands
in
picadilly
not
by
any
means
as
much
later
as
i
could
have
wished
raffles
would
not
ask
me
to
his
rooms
that
night
he
said
he
made
it
a
rule
to
have
a
long
night
before
playing
cricket
and
other
games
his
final
word
to
me
was
framed
on
the
same
principle
mind
only
one
drink
bunny
two
at
the
outside
as
you
value
your
life
and
mine
i
remember
my
abject
obedience
and
the
endless
sleepless
night
it
gave
me
and
the
roofs
of
the
houses
opposite
standing
out
at
last
against
the
london
dawn
i
wondered
whether
i
should
ever
see
another
and
was
very
hard
on
myself
for
that
little
expedition
which
i
had
made
on
my
own
wilful
account
it
was
between
eight
and
nine
in
the
evening
when
we
took
up
our
position
in
the
garden
adjoining
that
of
reuben
rosenthall
the
house
itself
was
shut
up
thanks
to
the
outrageous
libertine
next
door
who
by
driving
away
the
neighbors
had
gone
far
towards
delivering
himself
into
our
hands
practically
secure
from
surprise
on
that
side
we
could
watch
our
house
under
cover
of
a
wall
just
high
enough
to
see
over
while
a
fair
margin
of
shrubs
in
either
garden
afforded
us
additional
protection
thus
entrenched
we
had
stood
an
hour
watching
a
pair
of
lighted
with
vague
shadows
flitting
continually
across
the
blinds
and
listening
to
the
drawing
of
corks
the
clink
of
glasses
and
a
gradual
crescendo
of
coarse
voices
within
our
luck
seemed
to
have
deserted
us
the
owner
of
the
purple
diamonds
was
dining
at
home
and
dining
at
undue
length
i
thought
it
was
a
raffles
differed
in
the
end
he
proved
right
wheels
grated
in
the
drive
a
carriage
and
pair
stood
at
the
steps
there
was
a
stampede
from
the
and
the
loud
voices
died
away
to
burst
forth
presently
from
the
porch
let
me
make
our
position
perfectly
clear
we
were
over
the
wall
at
the
side
of
the
house
but
a
few
feet
from
the
windows
on
our
right
one
angle
of
the
building
cut
the
back
lawn
in
two
diagonally
on
our
left
another
angle
just
permitted
us
to
see
the
jutting
steps
and
the
waiting
carriage
we
saw
rosenthall
come
out
saw
the
glimmer
of
his
diamonds
before
anything
then
came
the
pugilist
then
a
lady
with
a
head
of
hair
like
a
bath
sponge
then
another
and
the
party
was
complete
raffles
ducked
and
pulled
me
down
in
great
excitement
the
ladies
are
going
with
them
he
whispered
this
is
great
that
better
still
the
gardenia
the
millionaire
had
bawled
and
that
best
of
all
said
raffles
standing
upright
as
hoofs
and
wheels
crunched
through
the
gates
and
rattled
off
at
a
fine
speed
now
what
i
whispered
trembling
with
excitement
they
be
clearing
away
yes
here
come
their
shadows
the
windows
open
on
the
lawn
bunny
it
the
psychological
moment
where
that
mask
i
produced
it
with
a
hand
whose
trembling
i
tried
in
vain
to
still
and
could
have
died
for
raffles
when
he
made
no
comment
on
what
he
could
not
fail
to
notice
his
own
hands
were
firm
and
cool
as
he
adjusted
my
mask
for
me
and
then
his
own
by
jove
old
boy
he
whispered
cheerily
you
look
about
the
greatest
ruffian
i
ever
saw
these
masks
alone
will
down
a
nigger
if
we
meet
one
but
i
glad
i
remembered
to
tell
you
not
to
shave
you
pass
for
whitechapel
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
and
you
do
forget
to
talk
the
lingo
better
sulk
like
a
mule
if
you
not
sure
of
it
and
leave
the
dialogue
to
me
but
please
our
stars
there
will
be
no
need
now
are
you
ready
quite
got
your
gag
yes
shooter
yes
then
follow
me
in
an
instant
we
were
over
the
wall
in
another
on
the
lawn
behind
the
house
there
was
no
moon
the
very
stars
in
their
courses
had
veiled
themselves
for
our
benefit
i
crept
at
my
leader
heels
to
some
french
windows
opening
upon
a
shallow
veranda
he
pushed
they
yielded
luck
again
he
whispered
nothing
but
luck
now
for
a
light
and
the
light
came
a
good
score
of
electric
burners
glowed
red
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
then
rained
merciless
white
beams
into
our
blinded
eyes
when
we
found
our
sight
four
revolvers
covered
us
and
between
two
of
them
the
colossal
frame
of
reuben
rosenthall
shook
with
a
wheezy
laughter
from
head
to
foot
boys
he
hiccoughed
glad
to
see
ye
at
last
shift
foot
or
finger
you
on
the
left
though
and
you
a
dead
boy

my
eyes
had
torn
themselves
from
the
round
black
muzzles
from
the
accursed
diamonds
that
had
been
our
snare
the
pasty
of
the
pugilist
and
the
flaming
cheeks
and
hook
nose
of
rosenthall
himself
i
was
looking
beyond
them
at
the
doorway
filled
with
quivering
silk
and
plush
black
faces
white
eyeballs
woolly
pates
but
a
sudden
silence
recalled
my
attention
to
the
millionaire
and
only
his
nose
retained
its
color
what
d
mean
he
whispered
with
a
hoarse
oath
spit

out
or
by
christmas

arst
the
on

the
gentleman
on
his
left
had
turned
livid
with
emotion
guilty
conscience
never
declared
itself
in
plainer
terms
for
a
moment
his
small
eyes
bulged
like
currants
in
the
suet
of
his
face
the
next
he
had
pocketed
his
pistols
on
a
professional
instinct
and
was
upon
us
with
his
fists
out
o
the
light
out
o
the
light
yelled
rosenthall
in
a
frenzy
he
was
too
late
no
sooner
had
the
burly
pugilist
obstructed
his
fire
than
raffles
was
through
the
window
at
a
bound
while
i
for
standing
still
and
saying
nothing
was
scientifically
felled
to
the
floor
i
can
not
have
been
many
moments
without
my
senses
when
i
recovered
them
there
was
a
great
in
the
garden
but
i
had
the
to
myself
i
sat
up
rosenthall
and
purvis
were
rushing
about
outside
cursing
the
kaffirs
and
nagging
at
each
other
over
that
wall
i
tell
yer
i
tell
you
it
was
this
one
ca
you
whistle
for
the
police
police
be
damned
i
had
enough
of
the
blessed
police
then
we
better
get
back
and
make
sure
of
the
other
rotter
oh
make
sure
o
yer
skin
that
what
you
better
do
jala
you
black
hog
if
i
catch
you
skulkin
i
never
heard
the
threat
i
was
creeping
from
the
on
my
hands
and
knees
my
own
revolver
swinging
by
its
steel
ring
from
my
teeth
for
an
instant
i
thought
that
the
hall
also
was
deserted
i
was
wrong
and
i
crept
upon
a
kaffir
on
all
fours
poor
devil
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
deal
him
a
base
blow
but
i
threatened
him
most
hideously
with
my
revolver
and
left
the
white
teeth
chattering
in
his
black
head
as
i
took
the
stairs
three
at
a
time
why
i
went
upstairs
in
that
decisive
fashion
as
though
it
were
my
only
course
i
can
not
explain
but
garden
and
ground
floor
seemed
alive
with
men
and
i
might
have
done
worse
i
turned
into
the
first
room
i
came
to
it
was
a
bedroom
empty
though
lit
up
and
never
shall
i
forget
how
i
started
as
i
entered
on
encountering
the
awful
villain
that
was
myself
at
full
length
in
a
masked
armed
and
ragged
i
was
indeed
fit
carrion
for
a
bullet
or
the
hangman
and
to
one
or
the
other
i
made
up
my
mind
nevertheless
i
hid
myself
in
the
wardrobe
behind
the
mirror
and
there
i
stood
shivering
and
cursing
my
fate
my
folly
and
raffles
most
of
all
raffles
first
and
last
for
i
daresay
half
an
hour
then
the
wardrobe
door
was
flung
suddenly
open
they
had
stolen
into
the
room
without
a
sound
and
i
was
hauled
downstairs
an
ignominious
captive
gross
scenes
followed
in
the
hall
the
ladies
were
now
upon
the
stage
and
at
sight
of
the
desperate
criminal
they
screamed
with
one
accord
in
truth
i
must
have
given
them
fair
cause
though
my
mask
was
now
torn
away
and
hid
nothing
but
my
left
ear
rosenthall
answered
their
shrieks
with
a
roar
for
silence
the
woman
with
the
hair
swore
at
him
shrilly
in
return
the
place
became
a
babel
impossible
to
describe
i
remember
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
the
police
appeared
purvis
and
the
ladies
were
for
calling
them
in
and
giving
me
in
charge
without
delay
rosenthall
would
not
hear
of
it
he
swore
that
he
would
shoot
man
or
woman
who
left
his
sight
he
had
had
enough
of
the
police
he
was
not
going
to
have
them
coming
there
to
spoil
sport
he
was
going
to
deal
with
me
in
his
own
way
with
that
he
dragged
me
from
all
other
hands
flung
me
against
a
door
and
sent
a
bullet
crashing
through
the
wood
within
an
inch
of
my
ear
you
drunken
fool
it
be
murder
shouted
purvis
getting
in
the
way
a
second
time
wha
do
i
care
he
armed
is
he
i
shot
him
in
it
be
a
warning
to
others
will
you
stand
aside
or
d
want
it
yourself
you
drunk
said
purvis
still
between
us
i
saw
you
take
a
neat
tumblerful
since
you
come
in
and
it
made
you
drunk
as
a
fool
pull
yourself
together
old
man
you
ai
to
do
what
you
be
sorry
for
then
i
wo
shoot
at
him
i
only
shoot
roun
an
roun
the
beggar
you
quite
right
ole
feller
would
hurt
him
great
mishtake
roun
an
roun
there
like
that
his
freckled
paw
shot
up
over
purvis
shoulder
mauve
lightning
came
from
his
ring
a
red
flash
from
his
revolver
and
shrieks
from
the
women
as
the
reverberations
died
away
some
splinters
lodged
in
my
hair
next
instant
the
disarmed
him
and
i
was
safe
from
the
devil
but
finally
doomed
to
the
deep
sea
a
policeman
was
in
our
midst
he
had
entered
through
the
window
he
was
an
officer
of
few
words
and
creditable
promptitude
in
a
twinkling
he
had
the
handcuffs
on
my
wrists
while
the
pugilist
explained
the
situation
and
his
patron
reviled
the
force
and
its
representative
with
impotent
malignity
a
fine
watch
they
kept
a
lot
of
good
they
did
coming
in
when
all
was
over
and
the
whole
household
might
have
been
murdered
in
their
sleep
the
officer
only
deigned
to
notice
him
as
he
marched
me
off
we
know
all
about
you
sir
said
he
contemptuously
and
he
refused
the
sovereign
purvis
proffered
you
will
be
seeing
me
again
sir
at
marylebone
shall
i
come
now
as
you
please
sir
i
rather
think
the
other
gentleman
requires
you
more
and
i
do
fancy
this
young
man
means
to
give
much
trouble
oh
i
coming
quietly
i
said
and
i
went
in
silence
we
traversed
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
it
must
have
been
midnight
we
did
not
meet
a
soul
at
last
i
whispered
how
on
earth
did
you
manage
it
purely
by
luck
said
raffles
i
had
the
luck
to
get
clear
away
through
knowing
every
brick
of
those
walls
and
the
double
luck
to
have
these
togs
with
the
rest
over
at
chelsea
the
helmet
is
one
of
a
collection
i
made
up
at
oxford
here
it
goes
over
this
wall
and
we
better
carry
the
coat
and
belt
before
we
meet
a
real
officer
i
got
them
once
for
a
fancy
ball
ostensibly
and
thereby
hangs
a
yarn
i
always
thought
they
might
come
in
useful
a
second
time
my
chief
crux
was
getting
rid
of
the
hansom
that
brought
me
back
i
sent
him
off
to
scotland
yard
with
ten
bob
and
a
special
message
to
good
old
mackenzie
the
whole
detective
department
will
be
at
rosenthall
in
about
half
an
hour
of
course
i
speculated
on
our
gentleman
hatred
of
the
police
another
huge
slice
of
luck
if
got
away
well
and
good
if
not
i
felt
he
was
the
man
to
play
with
his
mouse
as
long
as
possible
yes
bunny
it
been
more
of
a
costume
piece
than
i
intended
and
we
come
out
of
it
with
a
good
deal
less
credit
but
by
jove
we
jolly
lucky
to
have
come
out
of
it
at
all
gentlemen
and
players
old
raffles
may
or
may
not
have
been
an
exceptional
criminal
but
as
a
cricketer
i
dare
swear
he
was
unique
himself
a
dangerous
bat
a
brilliant
field
and
perhaps
the
very
finest
slow
bowler
of
his
decade
he
took
incredibly
little
interest
in
the
game
at
large
he
never
went
up
to
lord
without
his
or
showed
the
slightest
interest
in
the
result
of
a
match
in
which
he
was
not
himself
engaged
nor
was
this
mere
hateful
egotism
on
his
part
he
professed
to
have
lost
all
enthusiasm
for
the
game
and
to
keep
it
up
only
from
the
very
lowest
motives
cricket
said
raffles
like
everything
else
is
good
enough
sport
until
you
discover
a
better
as
a
source
of
excitement
it
is
in
it
with
other
things
you
wot
of
bunny
and
the
involuntary
comparison
becomes
a
bore
what
the
satisfaction
of
taking
a
man
wicket
when
you
want
his
spoons
still
if
you
can
bowl
a
bit
your
low
cunning
wo
get
rusty
and
always
looking
for
the
weak
spot
just
the
kind
of
mental
exercise
one
wants
yes
perhaps
there
some
affinity
between
the
two
things
after
all
but
i
chuck
up
cricket
bunny
if
it
was
for
the
glorious
protection
it
affords
a
person
of
my
proclivities
how
so
said
i
it
brings
you
before
the
public
i
should
have
thought
far
more
than
is
either
safe
or
wise
my
dear
bunny
that
exactly
where
you
make
a
mistake
to
follow
crime
with
reasonable
impunity
you
simply
must
have
a
parallel
ostensible
career
the
more
public
the
better
the
principle
is
obvious
peace
of
pious
memory
disarmed
suspicion
by
acquiring
a
local
reputation
for
playing
the
fiddle
and
taming
animals
and
it
my
profound
conviction
that
jack
the
ripper
was
a
really
eminent
public
man
whose
speeches
were
very
likely
reported
alongside
his
atrocities
fill
the
bill
in
some
prominent
part
and
you
never
be
suspected
of
doubling
it
with
another
of
equal
prominence
that
why
i
want
you
to
cultivate
journalism
my
boy
and
sign
all
you
can
and
it
the
one
and
only
reason
why
i
do
burn
my
bats
for
firewood
nevertheless
when
he
did
play
there
was
no
keener
performer
on
the
field
nor
one
more
anxious
to
do
well
for
his
side
i
remember
how
he
went
to
the
nets
before
the
first
match
of
the
season
with
his
pocket
full
of
sovereigns
which
he
put
on
the
stumps
instead
of
bails
it
was
a
sight
to
see
the
professionals
bowling
like
demons
for
the
hard
cash
for
whenever
a
stump
was
hit
a
pound
was
tossed
to
the
bowler
and
another
balanced
in
its
stead
while
one
man
took
with
a
ball
that
spreadeagled
the
wicket
raffles
practice
cost
him
either
eight
or
nine
sovereigns
but
he
had
absolutely
bowling
all
the
time
and
he
made
runs
next
day
it
became
my
pleasure
to
accompany
him
to
all
his
matches
to
watch
every
ball
he
bowled
or
played
or
fielded
and
to
sit
chatting
with
him
in
the
pavilion
when
he
was
doing
none
of
these
three
things
you
might
have
seen
us
there
side
by
side
during
the
greater
part
of
the
gentlemen
first
innings
against
the
players
who
had
lost
the
toss
on
the
second
monday
in
july
we
were
to
be
seen
but
not
heard
for
raffles
had
failed
to
score
and
was
uncommonly
cross
for
a
player
who
cared
so
little
for
the
game
merely
taciturn
with
me
he
was
positively
rude
to
more
than
one
member
who
wanted
to
know
how
it
had
happened
or
who
ventured
to
commiserate
him
on
his
luck
there
he
sat
with
a
straw
hat
tilted
over
his
nose
and
a
cigarette
stuck
between
lips
that
curled
disagreeably
at
every
advance
i
was
therefore
much
surprised
when
a
young
fellow
of
the
exquisite
type
came
and
squeezed
himself
in
between
us
and
met
with
a
perfectly
civil
reception
despite
the
liberty
i
did
not
know
the
boy
by
sight
nor
did
raffles
introduce
us
but
their
conversation
proclaimed
at
once
a
slightness
of
acquaintanceship
and
a
license
on
the
lad
part
which
combined
to
puzzle
me
mystification
reached
its
height
when
raffles
was
informed
that
the
other
father
was
anxious
to
meet
him
and
he
instantly
consented
to
gratify
that
whim
he
in
the
ladies
enclosure
will
you
come
round
now
with
pleasure
says
raffles
keep
a
place
for
me
bunny
and
they
were
gone
young
crowley
said
some
voice
further
back
last
year
harrow
eleven
i
remember
him
worst
man
in
the
team
keen
cricketer
however
stopped
till
he
was
twenty
to
get
his
colors
governor
made
him
keen
breed
oh
pretty
sir
very
pretty
the
game
was
boring
me
i
only
came
to
see
old
raffles
perform
soon
i
was
looking
wistfully
for
his
return
and
at
length
i
saw
him
beckoning
me
from
the
palings
to
the
right
want
to
introduce
you
to
old
amersteth
he
whispered
when
i
joined
him
they
a
cricket
week
next
month
when
this
boy
crowley
comes
of
age
and
we
both
got
to
go
down
and
play
both
i
echoed
but
i
no
cricketer
shut
up
says
raffles
leave
that
to
me
i
been
lying
for
all
i
worth
he
added
sepulchrally
as
we
reached
the
bottom
of
the
steps
i
trust
to
you
not
to
give
the
show
away
there
was
a
gleam
in
his
eye
that
i
knew
well
enough
elsewhere
but
was
unprepared
for
in
those
healthy
sane
surroundings
and
it
was
with
very
definite
misgivings
and
surmises
that
i
followed
the
zingari
blazer
through
the
vast
of
hats
and
bonnets
that
bloomed
beneath
the
ladies
awning
lord
amersteth
was
a
man
with
a
short
mustache
and
a
double
chin
he
received
me
with
much
dry
courtesy
through
which
however
it
was
not
difficult
to
read
a
less
flattering
tale
i
was
accepted
as
the
inevitable
appendage
of
the
invaluable
raffles
with
whom
i
felt
deeply
incensed
as
i
made
my
bow
i
have
been
bold
enough
said
lord
amersteth
to
ask
one
of
the
gentlemen
of
england
to
come
down
and
play
some
rustic
cricket
for
us
next
month
he
is
kind
enough
to
say
that
he
would
have
liked
nothing
better
but
for
this
little
fishing
expedition
of
yours
and
lord
amersteth
succeeded
in
remembering
my
name
it
was
of
course
the
first
i
had
ever
heard
of
that
fishing
expedition
but
i
made
haste
to
say
that
it
could
easily
and
should
certainly
be
put
off
raffles
gleamed
approval
through
his
eyelashes
lord
amersteth
bowed
and
shrugged
you
very
good
i
sure
said
he
but
i
understand
you
a
cricketer
yourself
he
was
one
at
school
said
raffles
with
infamous
readiness
not
a
real
cricketer
i
was
stammering
meanwhile
in
the
eleven
said
lord
amersteth
i
afraid
not
said
i
but
only
just
out
of
it
declared
raffles
to
my
horror
well
well
we
ca
all
play
for
the
gentlemen
said
lord
amersteth
slyly
my
son
crowley
only
just
scraped
into
the
eleven
at
harrow
and
he
going
to
play
i
may
even
come
in
myself
at
a
pinch
so
you
wo
be
the
only
duffer
if
you
are
one
and
i
shall
be
very
glad
if
you
will
come
down
and
help
us
too
you
shall
flog
a
stream
before
breakfast
and
after
dinner
if
you
like
i
should
be
very
proud
i
was
beginning
as
the
mere
prelude
to
resolute
excuses
but
the
eye
of
raffles
opened
wide
upon
me
and
i
hesitated
weakly
to
be
duly
lost
then
that
settled
said
lord
amersteth
with
the
slightest
suspicion
of
grimness
it
to
be
a
little
week
you
know
when
my
son
comes
of
age
we
play
the
free
foresters
the
dorsetshire
gentlemen
and
probably
some
local
lot
as
well
but
raffles
will
tell
you
all
about
it
and
crowley
shall
write
another
wicket
by
jove
they
all
out
then
i
rely
on
you
both
and
with
a
little
nod
lord
amersteth
rose
and
sidled
to
the
gangway
raffles
rose
also
but
i
caught
the
sleeve
of
his
blazer
what
are
you
thinking
of
i
whispered
savagely
i
was
nowhere
near
the
eleven
i
no
sort
of
cricketer
i
shall
have
to
get
out
of
this
not
you
he
whispered
back
you
need
play
but
come
you
must
if
you
wait
for
me
after
six
i
tell
you
why
but
i
could
guess
the
reason
and
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
it
revolted
me
much
less
than
did
the
notion
of
making
a
public
fool
of
myself
on
a
my
gorge
rose
at
this
as
it
no
longer
rose
at
crime
and
it
was
in
no
tranquil
humor
that
i
strolled
about
the
ground
while
raffles
disappeared
in
the
pavilion
nor
was
my
annoyance
lessened
by
a
little
meeting
i
witnessed
between
young
crowley
and
his
father
who
shrugged
as
he
stopped
and
stooped
to
convey
some
information
which
made
the
young
man
look
a
little
blank
it
may
have
been
pure
on
my
part
but
i
could
have
sworn
that
the
trouble
was
their
inability
to
secure
the
great
raffles
without
his
insignificant
friend
then
the
bell
rang
and
i
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
pavilion
to
watch
raffles
bowl
no
subtleties
are
lost
up
there
and
if
ever
a
bowler
was
full
of
them
it
was
raffles
on
this
day
as
indeed
all
the
cricket
world
remembers
one
had
not
to
be
a
cricketer
oneself
to
appreciate
his
perfect
command
of
pitch
and
break
his
beautifully
easy
action
which
never
varied
with
the
varying
pace
his
great
ball
on
the
his
dropping
in
a
word
the
infinite
ingenuity
of
that
versatile
attack
it
was
no
mere
exhibition
of
athletic
prowess
it
was
an
intellectual
treat
and
one
with
a
special
significance
in
my
eyes
i
saw
the
affinity
between
the
two
things
saw
it
in
that
afternoon
tireless
warfare
against
the
flower
of
professional
cricket
it
was
not
that
raffles
took
many
wickets
for
few
runs
he
was
too
fine
a
bowler
to
mind
being
hit
and
time
was
short
and
the
wicket
good
what
i
admired
and
what
i
remember
was
the
combination
of
resource
and
cunning
of
patience
and
precision
of
and
handiwork
which
made
every
over
an
artistic
whole
it
was
all
so
characteristic
of
that
other
raffles
whom
i
alone
knew
i
felt
like
bowling
this
afternoon
he
told
me
later
in
the
hansom
with
a
pitch
to
help
me
i
have
done
something
big
as
it
is
three
for
out
of
the
four
that
fell
is
so
bad
for
a
slow
bowler
on
a
plumb
wicket
against
those
fellows
but
i
felt
venomous
nothing
riles
me
more
than
being
asked
about
for
my
cricket
as
though
i
were
a
pro
myself
then
why
on
earth
go
to
punish
them
and
because
we
shall
be
jolly
hard
up
bunny
before
the
season
over
ah
said
i
i
thought
it
was
that
of
course
it
was
it
seems
they
going
to
have
the
very
devil
of
a
week
of
it
balls
dinner
parties
swagger
house
party
general
junketings
and
obviously
a
houseful
of
diamonds
as
well
diamonds
galore
as
a
general
rule
nothing
would
induce
me
to
abuse
my
position
as
a
guest
i
never
done
it
bunny
but
in
this
case
we
engaged
like
the
waiters
and
the
band
and
by
heaven
we
take
our
toll
let
have
a
quiet
dinner
somewhere
and
talk
it
over
it
seems
rather
a
vulgar
sort
of
theft
i
could
not
help
saying
and
to
this
my
single
protest
raffles
instantly
assented
it
is
a
vulgar
sort
said
he
but
i
ca
help
that
we
getting
vulgarly
hard
up
again
and
there
an
end
on
besides
these
people
deserve
it
and
can
afford
it
and
do
you
run
away
with
the
idea
that
all
will
be
plain
sailing
nothing
will
be
easier
than
getting
some
stuff
and
nothing
harder
than
avoiding
all
suspicion
as
of
course
we
must
we
may
come
away
with
no
more
than
a
good
working
plan
of
the
premises
who
knows
in
any
case
there
weeks
of
thinking
in
it
for
you
and
me
but
with
those
weeks
i
will
not
weary
you
further
than
by
remarking
that
the
thinking
was
done
entirely
by
raffles
who
did
not
always
trouble
to
communicate
his
thoughts
to
me
his
reticence
however
was
no
longer
an
irritant
i
began
to
accept
it
as
a
necessary
convention
of
these
little
enterprises
and
after
our
last
adventure
of
the
kind
more
especially
after
its
denouement
my
trust
in
raffles
was
much
too
solid
to
be
shaken
by
a
want
of
trust
in
me
which
i
still
believe
to
have
been
more
the
instinct
of
the
criminal
than
the
judgment
of
the
man
it
was
on
monday
the
tenth
of
august
that
we
were
due
at
milchester
abbey
dorset
and
the
beginning
of
the
month
found
us
cruising
about
that
very
county
with
actually
in
our
hands
the
idea
was
that
we
should
acquire
at
once
a
local
reputation
as
decent
fishermen
and
some
knowledge
of
the
countryside
with
a
view
to
further
and
more
deliberate
operations
in
the
event
of
an
unprofitable
week
there
was
another
idea
which
raffles
kept
to
himself
until
he
had
got
me
down
there
then
one
day
he
produced
a
in
a
meadow
we
were
crossing
and
threw
me
catches
for
an
hour
together
more
hours
he
spent
in
bowling
to
me
on
the
nearest
green
and
if
i
was
never
a
cricketer
at
least
i
came
nearer
to
being
one
by
the
end
of
that
week
than
ever
before
or
since
incident
began
early
on
the
monday
we
had
sallied
forth
from
a
desolate
little
junction
within
quite
a
few
miles
of
milchester
had
been
caught
in
a
shower
had
run
for
shelter
to
a
wayside
inn
a
florid
overdressed
man
was
drinking
in
the
parlor
and
i
could
have
sworn
it
was
at
the
sight
of
him
that
raffles
recoiled
on
the
threshold
and
afterwards
insisted
on
returning
to
the
station
through
the
rain
he
assured
me
however
that
the
odor
of
stale
ale
had
almost
knocked
him
down
and
i
had
to
make
what
i
could
of
his
speculative
downcast
eyes
and
knitted
brows
milchester
abbey
is
a
gray
quadrangular
pile
in
rich
woody
country
and
twinkling
with
triple
rows
of
quaint
windows
every
one
of
which
seemed
alight
as
we
drove
up
just
in
time
to
dress
for
dinner
the
carriage
had
whirled
us
under
i
know
not
how
many
triumphal
arches
in
process
of
construction
and
past
the
tents
and
of
a
on
which
raffles
undertook
to
bowl
up
to
his
reputation
but
the
chief
signs
of
festival
were
within
where
we
found
an
enormous
assembled
including
more
persons
of
pomp
majesty
and
dominion
than
i
had
ever
encountered
in
one
room
before
i
confess
i
felt
overpowered
our
errand
and
my
own
presences
combined
to
rob
me
of
an
address
upon
which
i
have
sometimes
plumed
myself
and
i
have
a
grim
recollection
of
my
nervous
relief
when
dinner
was
at
last
announced
i
little
knew
what
an
ordeal
it
was
to
prove
i
had
taken
in
a
much
less
formidable
young
lady
than
might
have
fallen
to
my
lot
indeed
i
began
by
blessing
my
good
fortune
in
this
respect
miss
melhuish
was
merely
the
rector
daughter
and
she
had
only
been
asked
to
make
an
even
number
she
informed
me
of
both
facts
before
the
soup
reached
us
and
her
subsequent
conversation
was
characterized
by
the
same
engaging
candor
it
exposed
what
was
little
short
of
a
mania
for
imparting
information
i
had
simply
to
listen
to
nod
and
to
be
thankful
when
i
confessed
to
knowing
very
few
of
those
present
even
by
sight
my
entertaining
companion
proceeded
to
tell
me
who
everybody
was
beginning
on
my
left
and
working
conscientiously
round
to
her
right
this
lasted
quite
a
long
time
and
really
interested
me
but
a
great
deal
that
followed
did
not
and
obviously
to
recapture
my
unworthy
attention
miss
melhuish
suddenly
asked
me
in
a
sensational
whisper
whether
i
could
keep
a
secret
i
said
i
thought
i
might
whereupon
another
question
followed
in
still
lower
and
more
thrilling
accents
are
you
afraid
of
burglars
burglars
i
was
roused
at
last
the
word
stabbed
me
i
repeated
it
in
horrified
query
so
i
found
something
to
interest
you
at
last
said
miss
melhuish
in
naive
triumph
yes
burglars
but
do
speak
so
loud
supposed
to
be
kept
a
great
secret
i
really
ought
to
tell
you
at
all
but
what
is
there
to
tell
i
whispered
with
satisfactory
impatience
you
promise
not
to
speak
of
it
of
course
well
then
there
are
burglars
in
the
neighborhood
have
they
committed
any
robberies
not
yet
then
how
do
you
know
they
been
seen
in
the
district
two
london
thieves
two
i
looked
at
raffles
i
had
done
so
often
during
the
evening
envying
him
his
high
spirits
his
iron
nerve
his
buoyant
wit
his
perfect
ease
and
but
now
i
pitied
him
through
all
my
own
terror
and
consternation
i
pitied
him
as
he
sat
eating
and
drinking
and
laughing
and
talking
without
a
cloud
of
fear
or
of
embarrassment
on
his
handsome
taking
daredevil
face
i
caught
up
my
champagne
and
emptied
the
glass
who
has
seen
them
i
then
asked
calmly
a
detective
they
were
traced
down
from
town
a
few
days
ago
they
are
believed
to
have
designs
on
the
abbey
but
why
are
they
run
in
exactly
what
i
asked
papa
on
the
way
here
this
evening
he
says
there
is
no
warrant
out
against
the
men
at
present
and
all
that
can
be
done
is
to
watch
their
movements
oh
so
they
are
being
watched
yes
by
a
detective
who
is
down
here
on
purpose
and
i
heard
lord
amersteth
tell
papa
that
they
had
been
seen
this
afternoon
at
warbeck
junction
the
very
place
where
raffles
and
i
had
been
caught
in
the
rain
our
stampede
from
the
inn
was
now
explained
on
the
other
hand
i
was
no
longer
to
be
taken
by
surprise
by
anything
that
my
companion
might
have
to
tell
me
and
i
succeeded
in
looking
her
in
the
face
with
a
smile
this
is
really
quite
exciting
miss
melhuish
said
i
may
i
ask
how
you
come
to
know
so
much
about
it
it
papa
was
the
confidential
reply
lord
amersteth
consulted
him
and
he
consulted
me
but
for
goodness
sake
do
let
it
get
about
i
ca
think
what
tempted
me
to
tell
you
you
may
trust
me
miss
melhuish
but
are
you
frightened
miss
melhuish
giggled
not
a
bit
they
wo
come
to
the
rectory
there
nothing
for
them
there
but
look
round
the
table
look
at
the
diamonds
look
at
old
lady
melrose
necklace
alone
the
dowager
marchioness
of
melrose
was
one
of
the
few
persons
whom
it
had
been
unnecessary
to
point
out
to
me
she
sat
on
lord
right
flourishing
her
and
drinking
champagne
with
her
usual
notorious
freedom
as
dissipated
and
kindly
a
dame
as
the
world
has
ever
seen
it
was
a
necklace
of
diamonds
and
sapphires
that
rose
and
fell
about
her
ample
neck
they
say
it
worth
five
thousand
pounds
at
least
continued
my
companion
lady
margaret
told
me
so
this
morning
that
lady
margaret
next
your
raffles
you
know
and
the
old
dear
will
wear
them
every
night
think
what
a
haul
they
would
be
no
we
do
feel
in
immediate
danger
at
the
rectory
when
the
ladies
rose
miss
melhuish
bound
me
to
fresh
vows
of
secrecy
and
left
me
i
should
think
with
some
remorse
for
her
indiscretion
but
more
satisfaction
at
the
importance
which
it
had
undoubtedly
given
her
in
my
eyes
the
opinion
may
smack
of
vanity
though
in
reality
the
very
springs
of
conversation
reside
in
that
same
human
universal
itch
to
thrill
the
auditor
the
peculiarity
of
miss
melhuish
was
that
she
must
be
thrilling
at
all
costs
and
thrilling
she
had
surely
been
i
spare
you
my
feelings
of
the
next
two
hours
i
tried
hard
to
get
a
word
with
raffles
but
again
and
again
i
failed
in
the
he
and
crowley
lit
their
cigarettes
with
the
same
match
and
had
their
heads
together
all
the
time
in
the
i
had
the
mortification
of
hearing
him
talk
interminable
nonsense
into
the
of
lady
melrose
whom
he
knew
in
town
lastly
in
the
they
had
a
great
and
lengthy
pool
while
i
sat
aloof
and
chafed
more
than
ever
in
the
company
of
a
very
serious
scotchman
who
had
arrived
since
dinner
and
who
would
talk
of
nothing
but
the
recent
improvements
in
instantaneous
photography
he
had
not
come
to
play
in
the
matches
he
told
me
but
to
obtain
for
lord
amersteth
such
a
series
of
cricket
photographs
as
had
never
been
taken
before
whether
as
an
amateur
or
a
professional
photographer
i
was
unable
to
determine
i
remember
however
seeking
distraction
in
little
bursts
of
resolute
attention
to
the
conversation
of
this
bore
and
so
at
last
the
long
ordeal
ended
glasses
were
emptied
men
said
and
i
followed
raffles
to
his
room
it
all
up
i
gasped
as
he
turned
up
the
gas
and
i
shut
the
door
we
being
watched
we
been
followed
down
from
town
there
a
detective
here
on
the
spot
how
do
you
know
asked
raffles
turning
upon
me
quite
sharply
but
without
the
least
dismay
and
i
told
him
how
i
knew
of
course
i
added
it
was
the
fellow
we
saw
in
the
inn
this
afternoon
the
detective
said
raffles
do
you
mean
to
say
you
do
know
a
detective
when
you
see
one
bunny
if
that
was
the
fellow
which
is
raffles
shook
his
head
to
think
that
you
been
talking
to
him
for
the
last
hour
in
the
and
could
spot
what
he
was
the
scotch
photographer
i
paused
aghast
scotch
he
is
said
raffles
and
photographer
he
may
be
he
is
also
inspector
mackenzie
of
scotland
yard
the
very
man
i
sent
the
message
to
that
night
last
april
and
you
could
spot
who
he
was
in
a
whole
hour
o
bunny
bunny
you
were
never
built
for
crime
but
said
i
if
that
was
mackenzie
who
was
the
fellow
you
bolted
from
at
warbeck
the
man
he
watching
but
he
watching
us
raffles
looked
at
me
with
a
pitying
eye
and
shook
his
head
again
before
handing
me
his
open
i
do
know
whether
smoking
forbidden
in
one
bedroom
but
better
take
one
of
these
and
stand
tight
bunny
because
i
going
to
say
something
offensive
i
helped
myself
with
a
laugh
say
what
you
like
my
dear
fellow
if
it
really
is
you
and
i
that
mackenzie
after
well
then
it
is
and
it
could
be
and
nobody
but
a
born
bunny
would
suppose
for
a
moment
that
it
was
do
you
seriously
think
he
would
sit
there
and
knowingly
watch
his
man
playing
pool
under
his
nose
well
he
might
he
a
cool
hand
mackenzie
but
i
not
cool
enough
to
win
a
pool
under
such
conditions
at
least
i
do
think
i
am
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
the
situation
was
free
from
strain
as
it
was
though
i
knew
he
was
thinking
of
us
crowley
told
me
all
about
it
after
dinner
you
see
and
then
i
seen
one
of
the
men
for
myself
this
afternoon
you
thought
it
was
a
detective
who
made
me
turn
tail
at
that
inn
i
really
do
know
why
i
did
tell
you
at
the
time
but
it
was
just
the
opposite
that
loud
brute
is
one
of
the
cleverest
thieves
in
london
and
i
once
had
a
drink
with
him
and
our
mutual
fence
i
was
an
eastender
from
tongue
to
toe
at
the
moment
but
you
will
understand
that
i
do
run
unnecessary
risks
of
recognition
by
a
brute
like
that
he
not
alone
i
hear
by
no
means
there
at
least
one
other
man
with
him
and
suggested
that
there
may
be
an
accomplice
here
in
the
house
did
lord
crowley
tell
you
so
crowley
and
the
champagne
between
them
in
confidence
of
course
just
as
your
girl
told
you
but
even
in
confidence
he
never
let
on
about
mackenzie
he
told
me
there
was
a
detective
in
the
background
but
that
was
all
putting
him
up
as
a
guest
is
evidently
their
big
secret
to
be
kept
from
the
other
guests
because
it
might
offend
them
but
more
particularly
from
the
servants
whom
he
here
to
watch
that
my
reading
of
the
situation
bunny
and
you
will
agree
with
me
that
it
infinitely
more
interesting
than
we
could
have
imagined
it
would
prove
but
infinitely
more
difficult
for
us
said
i
with
a
sigh
of
pusillanimous
relief
our
hands
are
tied
for
this
week
at
all
events
not
necessarily
my
dear
bunny
though
i
admit
that
the
chances
are
against
us
yet
i
not
so
sure
of
that
either
there
are
all
sorts
of
possibilities
in
these
combinations
set
a
to
watch
b
and
he
wo
have
an
eye
left
for
that
the
obvious
theory
but
then
mackenzie
a
very
big
i
should
be
sorry
to
have
any
boodle
about
me
with
that
man
in
the
house
yet
it
would
be
great
to
nip
in
between
a
and
b
and
score
off
them
both
at
once
it
would
be
worth
a
risk
bunny
to
do
that
it
would
be
worth
risking
something
merely
to
take
on
old
hands
like
b
and
his
men
at
their
own
old
game
eh
bunny
that
would
be
something
like
a
match
gentlemen
and
players
at
single
wicket
by
jove
his
eyes
were
brighter
than
i
had
known
them
for
many
a
day
they
shone
with
the
perverted
enthusiasm
which
was
roused
in
him
only
by
the
contemplation
of
some
new
audacity
he
kicked
off
his
shoes
and
began
pacing
his
room
with
noiseless
rapidity
not
since
the
night
of
the
old
bohemian
dinner
to
reuben
rosenthall
had
raffles
exhibited
such
excitement
in
my
presence
and
i
was
not
sorry
at
the
moment
to
be
reminded
of
the
fiasco
to
which
that
banquet
had
been
the
prelude
my
dear
said
i
in
his
very
own
tone
you
far
too
fond
of
the
uphill
game
you
will
eventually
fall
a
victim
to
the
sporting
spirit
and
nothing
else
take
a
lesson
from
our
last
escape
and
fly
lower
as
you
value
our
skins
study
the
house
as
much
as
you
like
but
do
not
go
and
shove
your
head
into
mackenzie
mouth
my
wealth
of
metaphor
brought
him
to
a
with
his
cigarette
between
his
fingers
and
a
grin
beneath
his
shining
eyes
you
quite
right
bunny
i
wo
i
really
wo
yet
you
saw
old
lady
melrose
necklace
i
been
wanting
it
for
years
but
not
going
to
play
the
fool
honor
bright
i
not
yet
by
jove
to
get
to
windward
of
the
professors
and
mackenzie
too
it
would
be
a
great
game
bunny
it
would
be
a
great
game
well
you
must
play
it
this
week
no
no
i
wo
but
i
wonder
how
the
professors
think
of
going
to
work
that
what
one
wants
to
know
i
wonder
if
they
really
got
an
accomplice
in
the
house
how
i
wish
i
knew
their
game
but
all
right
bunny
do
you
be
jealous
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
and
with
that
assurance
i
went
off
to
my
own
room
and
so
to
bed
with
an
incredibly
light
heart
i
had
still
enough
of
the
honest
man
in
me
to
welcome
the
postponement
of
our
actual
felonies
to
dread
their
performance
to
deplore
their
necessity
which
is
merely
another
way
of
stating
the
too
patent
fact
that
i
was
an
incomparably
weaker
man
than
raffles
while
every
whit
as
wicked
i
had
however
one
rather
strong
point
i
possessed
the
gift
of
dismissing
unpleasant
considerations
not
intimately
connected
with
the
passing
moment
entirely
from
my
mind
through
the
exercise
of
this
faculty
i
had
lately
been
living
my
frivolous
life
in
town
with
as
much
ignoble
enjoyment
as
i
had
derived
from
it
the
year
before
and
similarly
here
at
milchester
in
the
i
had
after
all
a
quite
excellent
time
it
is
true
that
there
were
other
factors
in
this
pleasing
disappointment
in
the
first
place
mirabile
dictu
there
were
one
or
two
even
greater
duffers
than
i
on
the
abbey
indeed
quite
early
in
the
week
when
it
was
of
most
value
to
me
i
gained
considerable
kudos
for
a
lucky
catch
a
ball
of
which
i
had
merely
heard
the
hum
stuck
fast
in
my
hand
which
lord
amersteth
himself
grasped
in
public
congratulation
this
happy
accident
was
not
to
be
undone
even
by
me
and
as
nothing
succeeds
like
success
and
the
constant
encouragement
of
the
one
great
cricketer
on
the
field
was
in
itself
an
immense
stimulus
i
actually
made
a
run
or
two
in
my
very
next
innings
miss
melhuish
said
pretty
things
to
me
that
night
at
the
great
ball
in
honor
of
viscount
crowley
majority
she
also
told
me
that
was
the
night
on
which
the
robbers
would
assuredly
make
their
raid
and
was
full
of
arch
tremors
when
we
sat
out
in
the
garden
though
the
entire
premises
were
illuminated
all
night
long
meanwhile
the
quiet
scotchman
took
countless
photographs
by
day
which
he
developed
by
night
in
a
dark
room
admirably
situated
in
the
part
of
the
house
and
it
is
my
firm
belief
that
only
two
of
his
knew
clephane
of
dundee
for
inspector
mackenzie
of
scotland
yard
the
week
was
to
end
with
a
trumpery
match
on
the
saturday
which
two
or
three
of
us
intended
abandoning
early
in
order
to
return
to
town
that
night
the
match
however
was
never
played
in
the
small
hours
of
the
saturday
morning
a
tragedy
took
place
at
milchester
abbey
let
me
tell
of
the
thing
as
i
saw
and
heard
it
my
room
opened
upon
the
central
gallery
and
was
not
even
on
the
same
floor
as
that
on
which
raffles
and
i
think
all
the
other
men
were
quartered
i
had
been
put
in
fact
into
the
of
one
of
the
grand
suites
and
my
too
near
neighbors
were
old
lady
melrose
and
my
host
and
hostess
now
by
the
friday
evening
the
actual
festivities
were
at
an
end
and
for
the
first
time
that
week
i
must
have
been
sound
asleep
since
midnight
when
all
at
once
i
found
myself
sitting
up
breathless
a
heavy
thud
had
come
against
my
door
and
now
i
heard
hard
breathing
and
the
dull
stamp
of
muffled
feet
i
got
ye
muttered
a
voice
it
no
use
struggling
it
was
the
scotch
detective
and
a
new
fear
turned
me
cold
there
was
no
reply
but
the
hard
breathing
grew
harder
still
and
the
muffled
feet
beat
the
floor
to
a
quicker
measure
in
sudden
panic
i
sprang
out
of
bed
and
flung
open
my
door
a
light
burnt
low
on
the
landing
and
by
it
i
could
see
mackenzie
swaying
and
staggering
in
a
silent
tussle
with
some
powerful
adversary
hold
this
man
he
cried
as
i
appeared
hold
the
rascal
but
i
stood
like
a
fool
until
the
pair
of
them
backed
into
me
when
with
a
deep
breath
i
flung
myself
on
the
fellow
whose
face
i
had
seen
at
last
he
was
one
of
the
footmen
who
waited
at
table
and
no
sooner
had
i
pinned
him
than
the
detective
loosed
his
hold
hang
on
to
him
he
cried
there
more
of
below
and
he
went
leaping
down
the
stairs
as
other
doors
opened
and
lord
amersteth
and
his
son
appeared
simultaneously
in
their
pyjamas
at
that
my
man
ceased
struggling
but
i
was
still
holding
him
when
crowley
turned
up
the
gas
what
the
devil
all
this
asked
lord
amersteth
blinking
who
was
that
ran
downstairs
mac
clephane
said
i
hastily
aha
said
he
turning
to
the
footman
so
you
the
scoundrel
are
you
well
done
well
done
where
was
he
caught
i
had
no
idea
here
lady
melrose
door
open
said
crowley
lady
melrose
lady
melrose
you
forget
she
deaf
said
lord
amersteth
ah
that
be
her
maid
an
inner
door
had
opened
next
instant
there
was
a
little
shriek
and
a
white
figure
gesticulated
on
the
threshold
ou
donc
est
de
madame
la
marquise
la
fenetre
est
ouverte
il
a
disparu
window
open
and
gone
by
jove
exclaimed
lord
amersteth
mais
comment
est
madame
la
marquise
est
elle
bien
oui
milor
elle
dort
sleeps
through
it
all
said
my
lord
she
the
only
one
then
what
made
mackenzie
clephane
bolt
young
crowley
asked
me
said
there
were
more
of
them
below
why
the
devil
could
you
tell
us
so
before
he
cried
and
went
leaping
downstairs
in
his
turn
he
was
followed
by
nearly
all
the
cricketers
who
now
burst
upon
the
scene
in
a
body
only
to
desert
it
for
the
chase
raffles
was
one
of
them
and
i
would
gladly
have
been
another
had
not
the
footman
chosen
this
moment
to
hurl
me
from
him
and
to
make
a
dash
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
come
lord
amersteth
had
him
in
an
instant
but
the
fellow
fought
desperately
and
it
took
the
two
of
us
to
drag
him
downstairs
amid
a
terrified
chorus
from
doors
eventually
we
handed
him
over
to
two
other
footmen
who
appeared
with
their
nightshirts
tucked
into
their
trousers
and
my
host
was
good
enough
to
compliment
me
as
he
led
the
way
outside
i
thought
i
heard
a
shot
he
added
did
you
i
thought
i
heard
three
and
out
we
dashed
into
the
darkness
i
remember
how
the
gravel
pricked
my
feet
how
the
wet
grass
numbed
them
as
we
made
for
the
sound
of
voices
on
an
outlying
lawn
so
dark
was
the
night
that
we
were
in
the
cricketers
midst
before
we
saw
the
shimmer
of
their
pyjamas
and
then
lord
amersteth
almost
trod
on
mackenzie
as
he
lay
prostrate
in
the
dew
who
this
he
cried
what
on
earth
happened
it
clephane
said
a
man
who
knelt
over
him
he
got
a
bullet
in
him
somewhere
is
he
alive
barely
good
god
where
crowley
here
i
am
called
a
breathless
voice
it
no
good
you
fellows
there
nothing
to
show
which
way
they
gone
here
raffles
chucked
it
too
and
they
ran
up
panting
well
we
got
one
of
them
at
all
events
muttered
lord
amersteth
the
next
thing
is
to
get
this
poor
fellow
indoors
take
his
shoulders
somebody
now
his
middle
join
hands
under
him
all
together
now
that
the
way
poor
fellow
poor
fellow
his
name
is
clephane
at
all
he
a
scotland
yard
detective
down
here
for
these
very
villains
raffles
was
the
first
to
express
surprise
but
he
had
also
been
the
first
to
raise
the
wounded
man
nor
had
any
of
them
a
stronger
or
more
tender
hand
in
the
slow
procession
to
the
house
in
a
little
we
had
the
senseless
man
stretched
on
a
sofa
in
the
library
and
there
with
ice
on
his
wound
and
brandy
in
his
throat
his
eyes
opened
and
his
lips
moved
lord
amersteth
bent
down
to
catch
the
words
yes
yes
said
he
we
got
one
of
them
safe
and
sound
the
brute
you
collared
upstairs
lord
amersteth
bent
lower
by
jove
lowered
the
out
of
the
window
did
he
and
they
got
clean
away
with
it
well
well
i
only
hope
we
be
able
to
pull
this
good
fellow
through
he
off
again
an
hour
passed
the
sun
was
rising
it
found
a
dozen
young
fellows
on
the
settees
in
the
drinking
whiskey
and
in
their
overcoats
and
pyjamas
and
still
talking
excitedly
in
one
breath
a
was
being
passed
from
hand
to
hand
the
doctor
was
still
in
the
library
at
last
the
door
opened
and
lord
amersteth
put
in
his
head
it
is
hopeless
said
he
but
it
bad
enough
there
be
no
cricket
another
hour
and
most
of
us
were
on
our
way
to
catch
the
early
train
between
us
we
filled
a
compartment
almost
to
suffocation
and
still
we
talked
all
together
of
the
night
event
and
still
i
was
a
little
hero
in
my
way
for
having
kept
my
hold
of
the
one
ruffian
who
had
been
taken
and
my
gratification
was
subtle
and
intense
raffles
watched
me
under
lowered
lids
not
a
word
had
we
had
together
not
a
word
did
we
have
until
we
had
left
the
others
at
paddington
and
were
skimming
through
the
streets
in
a
hansom
with
noiseless
tires
and
a
tinkling
bell
well
bunny
said
raffles
so
the
professors
have
it
eh
yes
said
i
and
i
jolly
glad
that
poor
mackenzie
has
a
ball
in
his
chest
that
you
and
i
have
been
on
the
decent
side
for
once
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
hopeless
bunny
quite
hopeless
i
take
it
you
would
have
refused
your
share
if
the
boodle
had
fallen
to
us
yet
you
positively
enjoy
coming
off
second
best
for
the
second
time
running
i
confess
however
that
the
professors
methods
were
full
of
interest
to
me
i
for
one
have
probably
gained
as
much
in
experience
as
i
have
lost
in
other
things
that
lowering
the
out
of
the
window
was
a
very
simple
and
effective
expedient
two
of
them
had
been
waiting
below
for
it
for
hours
how
do
you
know
i
asked
i
saw
them
from
my
own
window
which
was
just
above
the
dear
old
lady
i
was
fretting
for
that
necklace
in
particular
when
i
went
up
to
turn
in
for
our
last
night
and
i
happened
to
look
out
of
my
window
in
point
of
fact
i
wanted
to
see
whether
the
one
below
was
open
and
whether
there
was
the
slightest
chance
of
working
the
oracle
with
my
sheet
for
a
rope
of
course
i
took
the
precaution
of
turning
my
light
off
first
and
it
was
a
lucky
thing
i
did
i
saw
the
pros
right
down
below
and
they
never
saw
me
i
saw
a
little
tiny
luminous
disk
just
for
an
instant
and
then
again
for
an
instant
a
few
minutes
later
of
course
i
knew
what
it
was
for
i
have
my
own
daubed
with
luminous
paint
it
makes
a
lantern
of
sorts
when
you
can
get
no
better
but
these
fellows
were
not
using
theirs
as
a
lantern
they
were
under
the
old
lady
window
they
were
watching
the
time
the
whole
thing
was
arranged
with
their
accomplice
inside
set
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
in
a
minute
i
had
guessed
what
the
whole
thing
proved
to
be
and
you
did
nothing
i
exclaimed
on
the
contrary
i
went
downstairs
and
straight
into
lady
room
you
did
without
a
moment
hesitation
to
save
her
jewels
and
i
was
prepared
to
yell
as
much
into
her
for
all
the
house
to
hear
but
the
dear
lady
is
too
deaf
and
too
fond
of
her
dinner
to
wake
easily
well
she
did
stir
and
yet
you
allowed
the
professors
as
you
call
them
to
take
her
jewels
case
and
all
all
but
this
said
raffles
thrusting
his
fist
into
my
lap
i
would
have
shown
it
you
before
but
really
old
fellow
your
face
all
day
has
been
worth
a
fortune
to
the
firm
and
he
opened
his
fist
to
shut
it
next
instant
on
the
bunch
of
diamonds
and
of
sapphires
that
i
had
last
seen
encircling
the
neck
of
lady
melrose
le
premier
pas
that
night
he
told
me
the
story
of
his
earliest
crime
not
since
the
fateful
morning
of
the
ides
of
march
when
he
had
just
mentioned
it
as
an
unreported
incident
of
a
certain
cricket
tour
had
i
succeeded
in
getting
a
word
out
of
raffles
on
the
subject
it
was
not
for
want
of
trying
he
would
shake
his
head
and
watch
his
cigarette
smoke
thoughtfully
a
subtle
look
in
his
eyes
half
cynical
half
wistful
as
though
the
decent
honest
days
that
were
no
more
had
had
their
merits
after
all
raffles
would
plan
a
fresh
enormity
or
glory
in
the
last
with
the
unmitigated
enthusiasm
of
the
artist
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
one
throb
or
twitter
of
compunction
beneath
those
frankly
egotistic
and
infectious
transports
and
yet
the
ghost
of
a
dead
remorse
seemed
still
to
visit
him
with
the
memory
of
his
first
felony
so
that
i
had
given
the
story
up
long
before
the
night
of
our
return
from
milchester
cricket
however
was
in
the
air
and
back
where
he
sometimes
kept
it
in
the
fender
with
the
remains
of
an
orient
label
still
adhering
to
the
leather
my
eyes
had
been
on
this
label
for
some
time
and
i
suppose
his
eyes
had
been
on
mine
for
all
at
once
he
asked
me
if
i
still
burned
to
hear
that
yarn
it
no
use
i
replied
you
wo
spin
it
i
must
imagine
it
for
myself
how
can
you
oh
i
begin
to
know
your
methods
you
take
it
i
went
in
with
my
eyes
open
as
i
do
now
eh
i
ca
imagine
your
doing
otherwise
my
dear
bunny
it
was
the
most
unpremeditated
thing
i
ever
did
in
my
life
his
chair
wheeled
back
into
the
books
as
he
sprang
up
with
sudden
energy
there
was
quite
an
indignant
glitter
in
his
eyes
i
ca
believe
that
said
i
craftily
i
ca
pay
you
such
a
poor
compliment
then
you
must
be
a
fool
he
broke
off
stared
hard
at
me
and
in
a
trice
stood
smiling
in
his
own
despite
or
a
better
knave
than
i
thought
you
bunny
and
by
jove
it
the
knave
well
i
suppose
i
fairly
drawn
i
give
you
best
as
they
say
out
there
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
been
thinking
of
the
thing
myself
last
night
racket
reminds
me
of
it
in
one
or
two
respects
i
tell
you
what
though
this
is
an
occasion
in
any
case
and
i
going
to
celebrate
it
by
breaking
the
one
good
rule
of
my
life
i
going
to
have
a
second
drink
the
whiskey
tinkled
the
syphon
fizzed
the
ice
plopped
home
and
seated
there
in
his
pyjamas
with
the
inevitable
cigarette
raffles
told
me
the
story
that
i
had
given
up
hoping
to
hear
the
windows
were
wide
open
the
sounds
of
piccadilly
floated
in
at
first
long
before
he
finished
the
last
wheels
had
rattled
the
last
brawler
was
removed
we
alone
broke
the
quiet
of
the
summer
night
no
they
do
you
very
well
indeed
you
pay
for
nothing
but
drinks
so
to
speak
but
i
afraid
mine
were
of
a
comprehensive
character
i
had
started
in
a
hole
i
ought
really
to
have
refused
the
invitation
then
we
all
went
to
the
melbourne
cup
and
i
had
the
certain
winner
that
did
win
and
that
not
the
only
way
you
can
play
the
fool
in
melbourne
i
was
the
steady
old
stager
i
am
now
bunny
my
analysis
was
a
confession
in
itself
but
the
others
did
know
how
hard
up
i
was
and
i
swore
they
should
i
tried
the
jews
but
they
extra
fly
out
there
then
i
thought
of
a
kinsman
of
sorts
a
second
cousin
of
my
father
whom
none
of
us
knew
anything
about
except
that
he
was
supposed
to
be
in
one
or
other
of
the
colonies
if
he
was
a
rich
man
well
and
good
i
would
work
him
if
not
there
would
be
no
harm
done
i
tried
to
get
on
his
tracks
and
as
luck
would
have
it
i
succeeded
or
thought
i
had
at
the
very
moment
when
i
happened
to
have
a
few
days
to
myself
i
was
cut
over
on
the
hand
just
before
the
big
christmas
match
and
could
have
bowled
a
ball
if
they
had
played
me
the
surgeon
who
fixed
me
up
happened
to
ask
me
if
i
was
any
relation
of
raffles
of
the
national
bank
and
the
pure
luck
of
it
almost
took
my
breath
away
a
relation
who
was
a
high
official
in
one
of
the
banks
who
would
finance
me
on
my
mere
name
could
anything
be
better
i
made
up
my
mind
that
this
raffles
was
the
man
i
wanted
and
was
awfully
sold
to
find
next
moment
that
he
was
a
high
official
at
all
nor
had
the
doctor
so
much
as
met
him
but
had
merely
read
of
him
in
connection
with
a
small
sensation
at
the
suburban
branch
which
my
namesake
managed
an
armed
robber
had
been
rather
pluckily
beaten
off
with
a
bullet
in
him
by
this
raffles
and
the
sort
of
thing
was
so
common
out
there
that
this
was
the
first
i
had
heard
of
it
a
suburban
branch
my
financier
had
faded
into
some
excellent
fellow
with
a
billet
to
lose
if
he
called
his
soul
his
own
still
a
manager
was
a
manager
and
i
said
i
would
soon
see
whether
this
was
the
relative
i
was
looking
for
if
he
would
be
good
enough
to
give
me
the
name
of
that
branch
do
more
says
the
doctor
get
you
the
name
of
the
branch
he
been
promoted
to
for
i
think
i
heard
they
moved
him
up
one
already
and
the
next
day
he
brought
me
the
name
of
the
township
of
yea
some
fifty
miles
north
of
melbourne
but
with
the
vagueness
which
characterized
all
his
information
he
was
unable
to
say
whether
i
should
find
my
relative
there
or
not
a
single
man
and
his
initials
are
said
the
doctor
who
was
certain
enough
of
the
immaterial
points
left
his
old
post
several
days
ago
but
it
appears
he
not
due
at
the
new
one
till
the
new
year
no
doubt
he
go
before
then
to
take
things
over
and
settle
in
you
might
find
him
up
there
and
you
might
not
if
i
were
you
i
should
write
lose
two
days
said
i
more
if
he
is
there
for
grown
quite
keen
on
this
manager
and
i
felt
that
if
i
could
get
at
him
while
the
holidays
were
still
on
a
little
conviviality
might
help
matters
considerably
said
the
doctor
should
get
a
quiet
horse
and
ride
you
need
use
that
hand
i
go
by
train
can
and
you
ca
you
would
still
have
to
ride
i
suppose
you
a
horseman
i
should
certainly
ride
all
the
way
it
a
delightful
road
through
whittlesea
and
over
the
plenty
ranges
it
give
you
some
idea
of
the
bush
raffles
and
you
see
the
sources
of
the
water
supply
of
this
city
sir
you
see
where
every
drop
of
it
comes
from
the
pure
yan
yean
i
wish
i
had
time
to
ride
with
you
where
can
i
get
a
horse
the
doctor
thought
a
moment
a
mare
of
my
own
that
as
fat
as
butter
for
want
of
work
said
he
would
be
a
charity
to
me
to
sit
on
her
back
for
a
hundred
miles
or
so
and
then
i
should
know
you
have
no
temptation
to
use
that
hand
far
too
good
i
protested
raffles
he
said
and
if
ever
there
was
a
prettier
compliment
or
a
finer
instance
of
even
colonial
hospitality
i
can
only
say
bunny
that
i
never
heard
of
either
he
sipped
his
whiskey
threw
away
the
stump
of
his
cigarette
and
lit
another
before
continuing
well
i
managed
to
write
a
line
to
with
my
own
hand
which
as
you
will
gather
was
not
very
badly
wounded
it
was
simply
this
third
finger
that
was
split
and
in
splints
and
next
morning
the
doctor
packed
me
off
on
a
bovine
beast
that
would
have
done
for
an
ambulance
half
the
team
came
up
to
see
me
start
the
rest
were
rather
sick
with
me
for
not
stopping
to
see
the
match
out
as
if
i
could
help
them
to
win
by
watching
them
they
little
knew
the
game
i
got
on
myself
but
still
less
did
i
know
the
game
i
was
going
to
play
it
was
an
interesting
ride
enough
especially
after
passing
the
place
called
whittlesea
a
real
wild
township
on
the
lower
slope
of
the
ranges
where
i
recollect
having
a
deadly
meal
of
hot
mutton
and
tea
with
the
thermometer
at
three
figures
in
the
shade
the
first
thirty
miles
or
so
was
a
good
metal
road
too
good
to
go
half
round
the
world
to
ride
on
but
after
whittlesea
it
was
a
mere
track
over
the
ranges
a
track
i
often
could
see
and
left
entirely
to
the
mare
now
it
dipped
into
a
gully
and
ran
through
a
creek
and
all
the
time
the
local
color
was
inches
thick
galore
and
parrots
all
colors
of
the
rainbow
in
one
place
a
whole
forest
of
gums
had
been
and
were
just
as
though
they
had
been
painted
white
without
a
leaf
or
a
living
thing
for
miles
and
the
first
living
thing
i
did
meet
was
the
sort
to
give
you
the
creeps
it
was
a
riderless
horse
coming
full
tilt
through
the
bush
with
the
saddle
twisted
round
and
the
ringing
without
thinking
i
had
a
shot
at
heading
him
with
the
doctor
mare
and
blocked
him
just
enough
to
allow
a
man
who
came
galloping
after
to
do
the
rest
ye
mister
growled
the
man
a
huge
chap
in
a
red
checked
shirt
with
a
beard
like
grace
but
the
very
devil
of
an
expression
an
accident
said
i
reining
up
said
he
scowling
as
though
he
defied
me
to
ask
any
more
a
nasty
one
i
said
that
blood
on
the
saddle
well
bunny
i
may
be
a
blackguard
myself
but
i
do
think
i
ever
looked
at
a
fellow
as
that
chap
looked
at
me
but
i
stared
him
out
and
forced
him
to
admit
that
it
was
blood
on
the
twisted
saddle
and
after
that
he
became
quite
tame
he
told
me
exactly
what
had
happened
a
mate
of
his
had
been
dragged
under
a
branch
and
had
his
nose
smashed
but
that
was
all
had
sat
tight
after
it
till
he
dropped
from
loss
of
blood
another
mate
was
with
him
back
in
the
bush
as
i
said
already
bunny
i
was
the
old
stager
that
i
am
now
in
any
respect
and
we
parted
good
enough
friends
he
asked
me
which
way
i
was
going
and
when
i
told
him
he
said
i
should
save
seven
miles
and
get
a
good
hour
earlier
to
yea
by
striking
off
the
track
and
making
for
a
peak
that
we
could
see
through
the
trees
and
following
a
creek
that
i
should
see
from
the
peak
do
smile
bunny
i
began
by
saying
i
was
a
child
in
those
days
of
course
the
short
cut
was
the
long
way
round
and
it
was
nearly
dark
when
that
unlucky
mare
and
i
saw
the
single
street
of
yea
i
was
looking
for
the
bank
when
a
fellow
in
a
white
suit
ran
down
from
the
veranda
raffles
said
he
raffles
said
i
laughing
as
i
shook
his
hand
late
was
misdirected
all
i
relieved
he
said
you
know
what
they
are
saying
there
are
some
bushrangers
on
the
road
between
whittlesea
and
this
a
second
kelly
gang
they
have
caught
a
tartar
in
you
eh
would
in
you
i
retorted
and
my
tu
quoque
shut
him
up
and
seemed
to
puzzle
him
yet
there
was
much
more
sense
in
it
than
in
his
compliment
to
me
which
was
absolutely
pointless
afraid
you
find
things
pretty
rough
he
resumed
when
he
had
unstrapped
my
valise
and
handed
my
reins
to
his
man
lucky
you
a
bachelor
like
myself
i
could
not
quite
see
the
point
of
this
remark
either
since
had
i
been
married
i
should
hardly
have
sprung
my
wife
upon
him
in
this
fashion
i
muttered
the
conventional
sort
of
thing
and
then
he
said
i
should
find
it
all
right
when
i
settled
as
though
i
had
come
to
graze
upon
him
for
weeks
thought
i
colonials
do
take
the
cake
for
hospitality
and
still
marvelling
i
let
him
lead
me
into
the
private
part
of
the
bank
will
be
ready
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
said
he
as
we
entered
thought
you
might
like
a
tub
first
and
you
find
all
ready
in
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
sing
out
if
there
anything
you
want
your
luggage
has
turned
up
yet
by
the
way
but
here
a
letter
that
came
this
morning
for
me
did
you
expect
one
certainly
did
not
here
it
is
and
as
he
lit
me
to
my
room
i
read
my
own
superscription
of
the
previous
day
to
raffles
bunny
you
had
your
wind
bagged
at
footer
i
daresay
you
know
what
that
like
all
i
can
say
is
that
my
moral
wind
was
bagged
by
that
letter
as
i
hope
old
chap
i
have
never
yet
bagged
yours
i
speak
i
could
only
stand
with
my
own
letter
in
my
hands
until
he
had
the
good
taste
to
leave
me
by
myself
raffles
we
had
mistaken
each
other
for
raffles
for
the
new
manager
who
had
not
yet
arrived
small
wonder
we
had
conversed
at
the
only
wonder
was
that
we
had
not
discovered
our
mutual
mistake
how
the
other
man
would
have
laughed
but
i
i
could
not
laugh
by
jove
no
it
was
no
laughing
matter
for
me
i
saw
the
whole
thing
in
a
flash
without
a
tremor
but
with
the
direst
depression
from
my
own
single
point
of
view
call
it
callous
if
you
like
bunny
but
remember
that
i
was
in
much
the
same
hole
as
since
been
in
yourself
and
that
i
had
counted
on
this
raffles
even
as
you
counted
on
i
thought
of
the
man
with
the
beard
the
riderless
horse
and
the
bloody
saddle
the
deliberate
misdirection
that
had
put
me
off
the
track
and
out
of
the
way
and
now
the
missing
manager
and
the
report
of
bushrangers
at
this
end
but
i
simply
do
pretend
to
have
felt
any
personal
pity
for
a
man
whom
i
had
never
seen
that
kind
of
pity
usually
cant
and
besides
all
mine
was
needed
for
myself
i
was
in
as
big
a
hole
as
ever
what
the
devil
was
i
to
do
i
doubt
if
i
have
sufficiently
impressed
upon
you
the
absolute
necessity
of
my
returning
to
melbourne
in
funds
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
less
the
necessity
than
my
own
determination
which
i
can
truthfully
ascribe
as
absolute
money
i
would
have
but
how
but
how
would
this
stranger
be
open
to
persuasion
if
i
told
him
the
truth
no
that
would
set
us
all
scouring
the
country
for
the
rest
of
the
night
why
should
i
tell
him
suppose
i
left
him
to
find
out
his
mistake
would
anything
be
gained
bunny
i
give
you
my
word
that
i
went
in
to
dinner
without
a
definite
intention
in
my
head
or
one
premeditated
lie
upon
my
lips
i
might
do
the
decent
natural
thing
and
explain
matters
without
loss
of
time
on
the
other
hand
there
was
no
hurry
i
had
not
opened
the
letter
and
could
always
pretend
i
had
not
noticed
the
initials
meanwhile
something
might
turn
up
i
could
wait
a
little
and
see
tempted
i
already
was
but
as
yet
the
temptation
was
vague
and
its
very
vagueness
made
me
tremble
news
i
afraid
said
the
manager
when
at
last
i
sat
down
at
his
table
mere
annoyance
i
answered
i
do
assure
you
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
nothing
else
but
my
lie
was
told
my
position
was
taken
from
that
moment
onward
there
was
no
retreat
by
implication
without
realizing
what
i
was
doing
i
had
already
declared
myself
raffles
therefore
raffles
i
would
be
in
that
bank
for
that
night
and
the
devil
teach
me
how
to
use
my
lie
again
he
raised
his
glass
to
his
lips
i
had
forgotten
mine
his
caught
the
as
he
handed
it
to
me
i
shook
my
head
without
taking
my
eyes
from
his
the
devil
played
up
continued
raffles
with
a
laugh
before
i
tasted
my
soup
i
had
decided
what
to
do
i
had
determined
to
rob
that
bank
instead
of
going
to
bed
and
to
be
back
in
melbourne
for
breakfast
if
the
doctor
mare
could
do
it
i
would
tell
the
old
fellow
that
i
had
missed
my
way
and
been
bushed
for
hours
as
i
easily
might
have
been
and
had
never
got
to
yea
at
all
at
yea
on
the
other
hand
the
personation
and
robbery
would
ever
after
be
attributed
to
a
member
of
the
gang
that
had
waylaid
and
murdered
the
new
manager
with
that
very
object
you
are
acquiring
some
experience
in
such
matters
bunny
i
ask
you
was
there
ever
a
better
last
night
was
something
like
it
only
never
such
a
certainty
and
i
saw
it
from
the
beginning
saw
to
the
end
before
i
had
finished
my
soup
to
increase
my
chances
the
cashier
who
also
lived
in
the
bank
was
away
over
the
holidays
had
actually
gone
down
to
melbourne
to
see
us
play
and
the
man
who
had
taken
my
horse
also
waited
at
table
for
he
and
his
wife
were
the
only
servants
and
they
slept
in
a
separate
building
you
may
depend
i
ascertained
this
before
we
had
finished
dinner
indeed
i
was
by
way
of
asking
too
many
questions
the
most
oblique
and
delicate
was
that
which
elicited
my
host
name
ewbank
nor
was
i
careful
enough
to
conceal
their
drift
you
know
said
this
fellow
ewbank
who
was
one
of
the
downright
sort
it
was
you
i
should
say
you
were
in
a
funk
of
robbers
have
you
lost
your
nerve
hope
not
said
i
turning
jolly
hot
i
can
tell
you
well
it
is
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
have
to
put
a
bullet
through
a
fellow
said
he
coolly
should
enjoy
nothing
better
myself
besides
yours
did
go
through
wish
it
had
i
was
smart
enough
to
cry
said
he
and
i
emptied
my
glass
actually
i
did
not
know
whether
my
wounded
was
in
prison
dead
or
at
large
but
now
that
i
had
had
more
than
enough
of
it
ewbank
would
come
back
to
the
subject
he
admitted
that
the
staff
was
small
but
as
for
himself
he
had
a
loaded
revolver
under
his
pillow
all
night
under
the
counter
all
day
and
he
was
only
waiting
for
his
chance
the
counter
eh
i
was
ass
enough
to
say
so
had
you
he
was
looking
at
me
in
surprise
and
something
told
me
that
to
say
course
i
had
forgotten
would
have
been
quite
fatal
considering
what
i
was
supposed
to
have
done
so
i
looked
down
my
nose
and
shook
my
head
the
papers
said
you
had
he
cried
under
the
counter
said
i
it
the
regulation
for
the
moment
bunny
i
felt
stumped
though
i
trust
i
only
looked
more
superior
than
before
and
i
think
i
justified
my
look
regulation
i
said
at
length
in
the
most
offensive
tone
at
my
command
the
regulation
would
have
us
all
dead
men
my
dear
sir
do
you
expect
your
bank
robber
to
let
you
reach
for
your
gun
in
the
place
where
he
knows
it
kept
i
had
mine
in
my
pocket
and
i
got
my
chance
by
retreating
from
the
counter
with
all
visible
reluctance
ewbank
stared
at
me
with
open
eyes
and
a
forehead
then
down
came
his
fist
on
the
table
god
that
was
smart
still
he
added
like
a
man
who
would
not
be
in
the
wrong
papers
said
the
other
thing
you
know
course
i
rejoined
they
said
what
i
told
them
you
would
have
had
me
advertise
the
fact
that
i
improved
upon
the
regulations
would
you
so
that
cloud
rolled
over
and
by
jove
it
was
a
cloud
with
a
golden
lining
not
silver
real
good
australian
gold
for
old
ewbank
quite
appreciated
me
till
then
he
was
a
hard
nut
a
much
older
man
than
myself
and
i
felt
pretty
sure
he
thought
me
young
for
the
place
and
my
supposed
feat
a
fluke
but
i
never
saw
a
man
change
his
mind
more
openly
he
got
out
his
best
brandy
he
made
me
throw
away
the
cigar
i
was
smoking
and
opened
a
fresh
box
he
was
a
party
with
a
red
moustache
and
a
very
humorous
face
not
unlike
tom
emmett
and
from
that
moment
i
laid
myself
out
to
attack
him
on
his
convivial
flank
but
he
was
a
rosenthall
bunny
he
had
a
head
and
could
have
drunk
me
under
the
table
ten
times
over
right
i
thought
may
go
to
bed
sober
but
you
sleep
like
a
and
i
threw
half
he
gave
me
through
the
open
window
when
he
was
looking
but
he
was
a
good
chap
ewbank
and
do
you
imagine
he
was
at
all
intemperate
convivial
i
called
him
and
i
only
wish
he
had
been
something
more
he
did
however
become
more
and
more
genial
as
the
evening
advanced
and
i
had
not
much
difficulty
in
getting
him
to
show
me
round
the
bank
at
what
was
really
an
unearthly
hour
for
such
a
proceeding
it
was
when
he
went
to
fetch
the
revolver
before
turning
in
i
kept
him
out
of
his
bed
another
twenty
minutes
and
i
knew
every
inch
of
the
business
premises
before
i
shook
hands
with
ewbank
in
my
room
you
wo
guess
what
i
did
with
myself
for
the
next
hour
i
undressed
and
went
to
bed
the
incessant
strain
involved
in
even
the
most
deliberate
impersonation
is
the
most
wearing
thing
i
know
then
how
much
more
so
when
the
impersonation
is
impromptu
there
no
getting
your
eye
in
the
next
word
may
bowl
you
out
it
batting
in
a
bad
light
all
through
i
have
told
you
of
half
the
tight
places
i
was
in
during
a
conversation
that
ran
into
hours
and
became
dangerously
intimate
towards
the
end
you
can
imagine
them
for
yourself
and
then
picture
me
spread
out
on
my
bed
getting
my
second
wind
for
the
big
deed
of
the
night
once
more
i
was
in
luck
for
i
had
not
been
lying
there
long
before
i
heard
my
dear
ewbank
snoring
like
a
harmonium
and
the
music
never
ceased
for
a
moment
it
was
as
loud
as
ever
when
i
crept
out
and
closed
my
door
behind
me
as
regular
as
ever
when
i
stopped
to
listen
at
his
and
i
have
still
to
hear
the
concert
that
i
shall
enjoy
much
more
the
good
fellow
snored
me
out
of
the
bank
and
was
still
snoring
when
i
again
stood
and
listened
under
his
open
window
why
did
i
leave
the
bank
first
to
catch
and
saddle
the
mare
and
tether
her
in
a
clump
of
trees
close
by
to
have
the
means
of
escape
nice
and
handy
before
i
went
to
work
i
have
often
wondered
at
the
instinctive
wisdom
of
the
precaution
unconsciously
i
was
acting
on
what
has
been
one
of
my
guiding
principles
ever
since
pains
and
patience
were
required
i
had
to
get
my
saddle
without
waking
the
man
and
i
was
not
used
to
catching
horses
in
a
then
i
distrusted
the
poor
mare
and
i
went
back
to
the
stables
for
a
hatful
of
oats
which
i
left
with
her
in
the
clump
hat
and
all
there
was
a
dog
too
to
reckon
with
our
very
worst
enemy
bunny
but
i
had
been
enough
to
make
immense
friends
with
him
during
the
evening
and
he
wagged
his
tail
not
only
when
i
came
downstairs
but
when
i
reappeared
at
the
as
the
new
manager
i
had
been
able
in
the
most
ordinary
course
to
pump
poor
ewbank
about
anything
and
everything
connected
with
the
working
of
the
bank
especially
in
those
twenty
last
invaluable
minutes
before
turning
in
and
i
had
made
a
very
natural
point
of
asking
him
where
he
kept
and
would
recommend
me
to
keep
the
keys
at
night
of
course
i
thought
he
would
take
them
with
him
to
his
room
but
no
such
thing
he
had
a
dodge
worth
two
of
that
what
it
was
does
much
matter
but
no
outsider
would
have
found
those
keys
in
a
month
of
sundays
i
of
course
had
them
in
a
few
seconds
and
in
a
few
more
i
was
in
the
itself
i
forgot
to
say
that
the
moon
had
risen
and
was
letting
quite
a
lot
of
light
into
the
bank
i
had
however
brought
a
bit
of
candle
with
me
from
my
room
and
in
the
which
was
down
some
narrow
stairs
behind
the
counter
in
the
i
had
no
hesitation
in
lighting
it
there
was
no
window
down
there
and
though
i
could
no
longer
hear
old
ewbank
snoring
i
had
not
the
slightest
reason
to
anticipate
disturbance
from
that
quarter
i
did
think
of
locking
myself
in
while
i
was
at
work
but
thank
goodness
the
iron
door
had
no
keyhole
on
the
inside
well
there
were
heaps
of
gold
in
the
safe
but
i
only
took
what
i
needed
and
could
comfortably
carry
not
much
more
than
a
couple
of
hundred
altogether
not
a
note
would
i
touch
and
my
native
caution
came
out
also
in
the
way
i
divided
the
sovereigns
between
all
my
pockets
and
packed
them
up
so
that
i
should
be
like
the
old
woman
of
banbury
cross
well
you
think
me
too
cautious
still
but
i
was
insanely
cautious
then
and
so
it
was
that
just
as
i
was
ready
to
go
whereas
i
might
have
been
gone
ten
minutes
there
came
a
violent
knocking
at
the
outer
door
bunny
it
was
the
outer
door
of
the
my
candle
must
have
been
seen
and
there
i
stood
with
the
grease
running
hot
over
my
fingers
in
that
brick
grave
of
a
there
was
only
one
thing
to
be
done
i
must
trust
to
the
sound
sleeping
of
ewbank
upstairs
open
the
door
myself
knock
the
visitor
down
or
shoot
him
with
the
revolver
i
had
been
new
chum
enough
to
buy
before
leaving
melbourne
and
make
a
dash
for
that
clump
of
trees
and
the
doctor
mare
my
mind
was
made
up
in
an
instant
and
i
was
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
the
knocking
still
continuing
when
a
second
sound
drove
me
back
it
was
the
sound
of
bare
feet
coming
along
a
corridor
my
narrow
stair
was
stone
i
tumbled
down
it
with
little
noise
and
had
only
to
push
open
the
iron
door
for
i
had
left
the
keys
in
the
safe
as
i
did
so
i
heard
a
handle
turn
overhead
and
thanked
my
gods
that
i
had
shut
every
single
door
behind
me
you
see
old
chap
caution
does
always
let
one
in
that
knocking
said
ewbank
up
above
i
could
not
make
out
the
answer
but
it
sounded
to
me
like
the
irrelevant
supplication
of
a
spent
man
what
i
did
hear
plainly
was
the
cocking
of
the
bank
revolver
before
the
bolts
were
shot
back
then
a
tottering
step
a
hard
short
shallow
breathing
and
voice
in
horror
god
good
lord
what
happened
to
you
you
bleeding
like
a
pig
now
came
with
a
grateful
sort
of
sigh
you
have
been
what
done
it
the
road
and
whittlesea
tied
to
tree
cock
shots
left
me
bleed
to
death
the
weak
voice
failed
and
the
bare
feet
bolted
now
was
my
time
if
the
poor
devil
had
fainted
but
i
could
not
be
sure
and
there
i
crouched
down
below
in
the
dark
at
the
iron
door
not
less
spellbound
than
imprisoned
it
was
just
as
well
for
ewbank
gone
a
minute
this
i
heard
him
say
and
when
the
other
spoke
again
his
voice
was
stronger
i
begin
to
feel
alive
talk
does
me
good
you
do
know
what
it
was
all
those
miles
alone
one
an
hour
at
the
outside
i
never
thought
i
should
come
through
you
must
let
me
tell
you
in
case
i
do
have
another
sip
you
i
said
bushrangers
of
course
there
are
no
such
things
nowadays
were
they
then
the
one
that
had
the
pot
shots
was
the
very
brute
i
drove
out
of
the
bank
at
coburg
with
a
bullet
in
him
i
knew
it
of
course
you
did
bunny
so
did
i
down
in
that
but
old
ewbank
did
and
i
thought
he
was
never
going
to
speak
again
delirious
he
says
at
last
in
blazes
do
you
think
you
are
new
manager
new
manager
in
bed
and
asleep
upstairs
did
he
arrive
evening
himself
raffles
i
damned
whispered
the
real
man
thought
it
was
just
revenge
but
now
i
see
what
it
was
my
dear
sir
the
man
upstairs
is
an
imposter
if
he
upstairs
still
he
must
be
one
of
the
gang
going
to
rob
the
bank
if
he
has
done
so
already
he
has
done
so
already
muttered
ewbank
after
him
upstairs
still
by
god
if
he
is
i
sorry
for
him
his
tone
was
quiet
enough
but
about
the
nastiest
i
ever
heard
i
tell
you
bunny
i
was
glad
i
brought
that
revolver
it
looked
as
though
it
must
be
mine
against
his
muzzle
to
muzzle
have
a
look
down
here
first
said
the
new
manager
he
gets
through
his
window
no
no
he
not
down
here
easy
to
have
a
look
bunny
if
you
ask
me
what
was
the
most
thrilling
moment
of
my
infamous
career
i
say
it
was
that
moment
there
i
stood
at
the
bottom
of
those
narrow
stone
stairs
inside
the
with
the
door
a
good
foot
open
and
i
did
know
whether
it
would
creak
or
not
the
light
was
coming
nearer
and
i
did
know
i
had
to
chance
it
and
it
creak
a
bit
it
was
far
too
solid
and
and
i
could
have
banged
it
if
i
tried
it
was
too
heavy
and
it
fitted
so
close
that
i
felt
and
heard
the
air
squeeze
out
in
my
face
every
shred
of
light
went
out
except
the
streak
underneath
and
it
brightened
how
i
blessed
that
door
he
not
down
there
i
heard
as
though
through
then
the
streak
went
out
too
and
in
a
few
seconds
i
ventured
to
open
once
more
and
was
in
time
to
hear
them
creeping
to
my
room
well
now
there
was
not
a
fifth
of
a
second
to
be
lost
but
i
proud
to
say
i
came
up
those
stairs
on
my
toes
and
fingers
and
out
of
that
bank
they
gone
and
left
the
door
open
just
as
gingerly
as
though
my
time
had
been
my
own
i
did
even
forget
to
put
on
the
hat
that
the
doctor
mare
was
eating
her
oats
out
of
as
well
as
she
could
with
a
bit
or
it
alone
would
have
landed
me
i
did
even
gallop
away
but
just
jogged
off
quietly
in
the
thick
dust
at
the
side
of
the
road
though
i
own
my
heart
was
galloping
and
thanked
my
stars
the
bank
was
at
that
end
of
the
township
in
which
i
really
had
set
foot
the
very
last
thing
i
heard
was
the
two
managers
raising
cain
and
the
coachman
and
now
bunny
he
stood
up
and
stretched
himself
with
a
smile
that
ended
in
a
yawn
the
black
windows
had
faded
through
every
shade
of
indigo
they
now
framed
their
opposite
neighbors
stark
and
livid
in
the
dawn
and
the
gas
seemed
turned
to
nothing
in
the
globes
but
that
not
all
i
cried
i
sorry
to
say
it
is
said
raffles
apologetically
the
thing
should
have
ended
with
an
exciting
chase
i
know
but
somehow
it
did
i
suppose
they
thought
i
had
got
no
end
of
a
start
then
they
had
made
up
their
minds
that
i
belonged
to
the
gang
which
was
not
so
many
miles
away
and
one
of
them
had
got
as
much
as
he
could
carry
from
that
gang
as
it
was
but
i
was
to
know
all
that
and
i
bound
to
say
that
there
was
plenty
of
excitement
left
for
me
lord
how
i
made
that
poor
brute
travel
when
i
got
among
the
trees
though
we
must
have
made
it
over
fifty
miles
from
melbourne
we
had
done
it
at
a
pace
and
those
stolen
oats
had
brisked
the
old
girl
up
to
such
a
pitch
that
she
fairly
bolted
when
she
felt
her
nose
turned
south
by
jove
it
was
no
joke
in
and
out
among
those
trees
and
under
branches
with
your
face
in
the
mane
i
told
you
about
the
forest
of
dead
gums
it
looked
perfectly
ghostly
in
the
moonlight
and
i
found
it
as
still
as
i
had
left
it
so
still
that
i
pulled
up
there
my
first
halt
and
lay
with
my
ear
to
the
ground
for
two
or
three
minutes
but
i
heard
nothing
not
a
thing
but
the
mare
bellow
and
my
own
heart
sorry
bunny
but
if
ever
you
write
my
memoirs
you
wo
have
any
difficulty
in
working
up
that
chase
play
those
dead
for
all
they
worth
and
let
the
bullets
fly
like
hail
i
turn
round
in
my
saddle
to
see
ewbank
coming
up
in
his
white
suit
and
i
duly
paint
it
red
do
it
in
the
third
person
and
they
know
how
it
going
to
end
but
i
do
know
myself
i
complained
did
the
mare
carry
you
all
the
way
back
to
melbourne
every
rod
pole
or
perch
i
had
her
well
seen
to
at
our
hotel
and
returned
her
to
the
doctor
in
the
evening
he
was
tremendously
tickled
to
hear
that
i
had
been
bushed
next
morning
he
brought
me
the
paper
to
show
me
what
i
had
escaped
at
yea
without
suspecting
anything
ah
said
raffles
as
he
put
out
the
gas
that
a
point
on
which
i
never
made
up
my
mind
the
mare
and
her
color
was
a
coincidence
luckily
she
was
only
a
bay
and
i
fancied
the
condition
of
the
beast
must
have
told
a
tale
the
doctor
manner
was
certainly
different
i
inclined
to
think
he
suspected
something
though
not
the
right
thing
i
was
expecting
him
and
i
fear
my
appearance
may
have
increased
his
suspicions
i
asked
him
why
i
used
to
have
rather
a
heavy
moustache
said
raffles
but
i
lost
it
the
day
after
i
lost
my
innocence
wilful
murder
of
the
various
robberies
in
which
we
were
both
concerned
it
is
but
the
few
i
find
that
will
bear
telling
at
any
length
not
that
the
others
contained
details
which
even
i
would
hesitate
to
recount
it
is
rather
the
very
absence
of
untoward
incident
which
renders
them
useless
for
my
present
purpose
in
point
of
fact
our
plans
were
so
craftily
laid
by
raffles
that
the
chances
of
a
hitch
were
invariably
reduced
to
a
minimum
before
we
went
to
work
we
might
be
disappointed
in
the
market
value
of
our
haul
but
it
was
quite
the
exception
for
us
to
find
ourselves
confronted
by
unforeseen
impediments
or
involved
in
a
really
dramatic
dilemma
there
was
a
sameness
even
in
our
spoil
for
of
course
only
the
most
precious
stones
are
worth
the
trouble
we
took
and
the
risks
we
ran
in
short
our
most
successful
escapades
would
prove
the
greatest
weariness
of
all
in
narrative
form
and
none
more
so
than
the
dull
affair
of
the
ardagh
emeralds
some
eight
or
nine
weeks
after
the
milchester
cricket
week
the
former
however
had
a
sequel
that
i
would
rather
forget
than
all
our
burglaries
put
together
it
was
the
evening
after
our
return
from
ireland
and
i
was
waiting
at
my
rooms
for
raffles
who
had
gone
off
as
usual
to
dispose
of
the
plunder
raffles
had
his
own
method
of
conducting
this
very
vital
branch
of
our
business
which
i
was
well
content
to
leave
entirely
in
his
hands
he
drove
the
bargains
i
believe
in
a
thin
but
subtle
disguise
of
the
order
and
always
in
the
cockney
dialect
of
which
he
had
made
himself
a
master
moreover
he
invariably
employed
the
same
fence
who
was
ostensibly
a
in
a
small
but
yet
notorious
way
and
in
reality
a
rascal
as
remarkable
as
raffles
himself
only
lately
i
also
had
been
to
the
man
but
in
my
proper
person
we
had
needed
capital
for
the
getting
of
these
very
emeralds
and
i
had
raised
a
hundred
pounds
on
the
terms
you
would
expect
from
a
graybeard
with
an
ingratiating
smile
an
incessant
bow
and
the
shiftiest
old
eyes
that
ever
flew
from
rim
to
rim
of
a
pair
of
spectacles
so
the
original
sinews
and
the
final
spoils
of
war
came
in
this
case
from
the
source
a
circumstance
which
appealed
to
us
both
but
these
same
final
spoils
i
was
still
to
see
and
i
waited
and
waited
with
an
impatience
that
grew
upon
me
with
the
growing
dusk
at
my
open
window
i
had
played
sister
ann
until
the
faces
in
the
street
below
were
no
longer
distinguishable
and
now
i
was
tearing
to
and
fro
in
the
grip
of
horrible
hypotheses
a
grip
that
tightened
when
at
last
the
opened
with
a
clatter
outside
that
held
me
breathless
until
a
tattoo
followed
on
my
door
in
the
dark
said
raffles
as
i
dragged
him
in
why
bunny
wrong
nothing
now
you
come
said
i
shutting
the
door
behind
him
in
a
fever
of
relief
and
anxiety
well
well
what
did
they
fetch
five
hundred
down
got
it
in
my
pocket
good
man
i
cried
you
do
know
what
a
stew
i
been
in
switch
on
the
light
i
been
thinking
of
you
and
nothing
else
for
the
last
hour
i
i
was
ass
enough
to
think
something
had
gone
wrong
raffles
was
smiling
when
the
white
light
filled
the
room
but
for
the
moment
i
did
not
perceive
the
peculiarity
of
his
smile
i
was
fatuously
full
of
my
own
late
tremors
and
present
relief
and
my
first
idiotic
act
was
to
spill
some
whiskey
and
squirt
the
all
over
in
my
anxiety
to
do
instant
justice
to
the
occasion
so
you
thought
something
had
happened
said
raffles
leaning
back
in
my
chair
as
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
looking
much
amused
what
would
you
say
if
something
had
sit
tight
my
dear
chap
it
was
nothing
of
the
slightest
consequence
and
it
all
over
now
a
stern
chase
and
a
long
one
bunny
but
i
think
i
well
to
windward
this
time
and
suddenly
i
saw
that
his
collar
was
limp
his
hair
matted
his
boots
thick
with
dust
the
police
i
whispered
aghast
oh
dear
no
only
old
baird
baird
but
was
it
baird
who
took
the
emeralds
it
was
then
how
came
he
to
chase
you
my
dear
fellow
i
tell
you
if
you
give
me
a
chance
it
really
nothing
to
get
in
the
least
excited
about
old
baird
has
at
last
spotted
that
i
not
quite
the
common
cracksman
i
would
have
him
think
me
so
he
been
doing
his
best
to
run
me
to
my
burrow
and
you
call
that
nothing
it
would
be
something
if
he
had
succeeded
but
he
has
still
to
do
that
i
admit
however
that
he
made
me
sit
up
for
the
time
being
it
all
comes
of
going
on
the
job
so
far
from
home
there
was
the
old
brute
with
the
whole
thing
in
his
morning
paper
he
knew
it
must
have
been
done
by
some
fellow
who
could
pass
himself
off
for
a
gentleman
and
i
saw
his
eyebrows
go
up
the
moment
i
told
him
i
was
the
man
with
the
same
old
twang
that
you
could
cut
with
a
i
did
my
best
to
get
out
of
it
swore
i
had
a
pal
who
was
a
real
swell
but
i
saw
very
plainly
that
i
had
given
myself
away
he
gave
up
haggling
he
paid
my
price
as
though
he
enjoyed
doing
it
but
i
felt
him
following
me
when
i
made
tracks
though
of
course
i
did
turn
round
to
see
why
not
my
dear
bunny
it
the
very
worst
thing
you
can
do
as
long
as
you
look
unsuspecting
they
keep
their
distance
and
so
long
as
they
keep
their
distance
you
stand
a
chance
once
show
that
you
know
being
followed
and
it
flight
or
fight
for
all
you
worth
i
never
even
looked
round
and
mind
you
never
do
in
the
same
hole
i
just
hurried
up
to
blackfriars
and
booked
for
high
street
kensington
at
the
top
of
my
voice
and
as
the
train
was
leaving
sloane
square
out
i
hopped
and
up
all
those
stairs
like
a
lamplighter
and
round
to
the
studio
by
the
back
streets
well
to
be
on
the
safe
side
i
lay
low
there
all
the
afternoon
hearing
nothing
in
the
least
suspicious
and
only
wishing
i
had
a
window
to
look
through
instead
of
that
beastly
skylight
however
the
coast
seemed
clear
enough
and
thus
far
it
was
my
mere
idea
that
he
would
follow
me
there
was
nothing
to
show
he
had
so
at
last
i
marched
out
in
my
proper
rig
almost
straight
into
old
baird
arms
what
on
earth
did
you
do
walked
past
him
as
though
i
had
never
set
eyes
on
him
in
my
life
and
did
then
took
a
hansom
in
the
king
road
and
drove
like
the
deuce
to
clapham
junction
rushed
on
to
the
nearest
platform
without
a
ticket
jumped
into
the
first
train
i
saw
got
out
at
twickenham
walked
full
tilt
back
to
richmond
took
the
district
to
charing
cross
and
here
i
am
ready
for
a
tub
and
a
change
and
the
best
dinner
the
club
can
give
us
i
came
to
you
first
because
i
thought
you
might
be
getting
anxious
come
round
with
me
and
i
wo
keep
you
long
you
certain
you
given
him
the
slip
i
said
as
we
put
on
our
hats
certain
enough
but
we
can
make
assurance
doubly
sure
said
raffles
and
went
to
my
window
where
he
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
looking
down
into
the
street
all
right
i
asked
him
all
right
said
he
and
we
went
downstairs
forthwith
and
so
to
the
albany
but
we
were
both
rather
silent
on
our
way
i
for
my
part
was
wondering
what
raffles
would
do
about
the
studio
in
chelsea
whither
at
all
events
he
had
been
successfully
dogged
to
me
the
point
seemed
one
of
immediate
importance
but
when
i
mentioned
it
he
said
there
was
time
enough
to
think
about
that
his
one
other
remark
was
made
after
we
had
nodded
in
bond
street
to
a
young
blood
of
our
acquaintance
who
happened
to
be
getting
himself
a
bad
name
poor
jack
rutter
said
raffles
with
a
sigh
nothing
sadder
than
to
see
a
fellow
going
to
the
bad
like
that
he
about
mad
with
drink
and
debt
poor
devil
did
you
see
his
eye
odd
that
we
should
have
met
him
by
the
way
it
old
baird
who
said
to
have
skinned
him
by
god
but
i
like
to
skin
old
baird
and
his
tone
took
a
sudden
low
fury
made
the
more
noticeable
by
another
long
silence
which
lasted
indeed
throughout
an
admirable
dinner
at
the
club
and
for
some
time
after
we
had
settled
down
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
with
our
coffee
and
cigars
then
at
last
i
saw
raffles
looking
at
me
with
his
lazy
smile
and
i
knew
that
the
morose
fit
was
at
an
end
i
daresay
you
wonder
what
i
been
thinking
about
all
this
time
said
he
i
been
thinking
what
rot
it
is
to
go
doing
things
by
halves
well
said
i
returning
his
smile
that
not
a
charge
that
you
can
bring
against
yourself
is
it
i
not
so
sure
said
raffles
blowing
a
meditative
puff
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
thinking
less
of
myself
than
of
that
poor
devil
of
a
jack
rutter
there
a
fellow
who
does
things
by
halves
only
half
gone
to
the
bad
and
look
at
the
difference
between
him
and
us
he
under
the
thumb
of
a
villainous
we
are
solvent
citizens
he
taken
to
drink
we
as
sober
as
we
are
solvent
his
pals
are
beginning
to
cut
him
our
difficulty
is
to
keep
the
pal
from
the
door
enfin
he
begs
or
borrows
which
is
stealing
by
halves
and
we
steal
outright
and
are
done
with
it
obviously
ours
is
the
more
honest
course
yet
i
not
sure
bunny
but
we
doing
the
thing
by
halves
ourselves
why
what
more
could
we
do
i
exclaimed
in
soft
derision
looking
round
however
to
make
sure
that
we
were
not
overheard
what
more
said
raffles
well
murder
for
one
thing
rot
a
matter
of
opinion
my
dear
bunny
i
do
mean
it
for
rot
told
you
before
that
the
biggest
man
alive
is
the
man
who
committed
a
murder
and
not
yet
been
found
out
at
least
he
ought
to
be
but
he
so
very
seldom
has
the
soul
to
appreciate
himself
just
think
of
it
think
of
coming
in
here
and
talking
to
the
men
very
likely
about
the
murder
itself
and
knowing
you
done
it
and
wondering
how
look
if
they
knew
oh
it
would
be
great
simply
great
but
besides
all
that
when
you
were
caught
there
be
a
merciful
and
dramatic
end
of
you
you
fill
the
bill
for
a
few
weeks
and
then
snuff
out
with
a
flourish
of
you
would
rust
with
a
vile
repose
for
seven
or
fourteen
years
good
old
raffles
i
chuckled
i
begin
to
forgive
you
for
being
in
bad
form
at
dinner
but
i
was
never
more
earnest
in
my
life
go
on
i
mean
it
you
know
very
well
that
you
would
commit
a
murder
whatever
else
you
might
do
i
know
very
well
i
going
to
commit
one
he
had
been
leaning
back
in
the
chair
watching
me
with
keen
eyes
sheathed
by
languid
lids
now
he
started
forward
and
his
eyes
leapt
to
mine
like
cold
steel
from
the
scabbard
they
struck
home
to
my
slow
wits
their
meaning
was
no
longer
in
doubt
i
who
knew
the
man
read
murder
in
his
clenched
hands
and
murder
in
his
locked
lips
but
a
hundred
murders
in
those
hard
blue
eyes
baird
i
faltered
moistening
my
lips
with
my
tongue
of
course
but
you
said
it
did
matter
about
the
room
in
chelsea
i
told
a
lie
anyway
you
gave
him
the
slip
afterwards
that
was
another
i
did
i
thought
i
had
when
i
came
up
to
you
this
evening
but
when
i
looked
out
of
your
window
you
remember
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
there
he
was
on
the
opposite
pavement
down
below
and
you
never
said
a
word
about
it
i
was
going
to
spoil
your
dinner
bunny
and
i
was
going
to
let
you
spoil
mine
but
there
he
was
as
large
as
life
and
of
course
he
followed
us
to
the
albany
a
fine
game
for
him
to
play
a
game
after
his
mean
old
heart
blackmail
from
me
bribes
from
the
police
the
one
bidding
against
the
other
but
he
play
it
with
me
he
live
to
and
the
world
will
have
an
extortioner
the
less
waiter
two
scotch
whiskeys
and
sodas
i
off
at
eleven
bunny
it
the
only
thing
to
be
done
you
know
where
he
lives
then
yes
out
willesden
way
and
alone
the
fellow
a
miser
among
other
things
i
long
ago
found
out
all
about
him
again
i
looked
round
the
room
it
was
a
young
man
club
and
young
men
were
laughing
chatting
smoking
drinking
on
every
hand
one
nodded
to
me
through
the
smoke
like
a
machine
i
nodded
to
him
and
turned
back
to
raffles
with
a
groan
surely
you
will
give
him
a
chance
i
urged
the
very
sight
of
your
pistol
should
bring
him
to
terms
it
would
make
him
keep
them
but
you
might
try
the
effect
i
probably
shall
here
a
drink
for
you
bunny
wish
me
luck
i
coming
too
i
do
want
you
but
i
must
come
an
ugly
gleam
shot
from
the
steel
blue
eyes
to
interfere
said
raffles
not
i
you
give
me
your
word
i
do
bunny
if
you
break
it
you
may
shoot
me
too
i
most
certainly
should
said
raffles
solemnly
so
you
come
at
your
own
peril
my
dear
man
but
if
you
are
coming
well
the
sooner
the
better
for
i
must
stop
at
my
rooms
on
the
way
five
minutes
later
i
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
piccadilly
entrance
to
the
albany
i
had
a
reason
for
remaining
outside
it
was
the
feeling
half
hope
half
fear
that
angus
baird
might
still
be
on
our
trail
that
some
more
immediate
and
less
way
of
dealing
with
him
might
result
from
a
sudden
encounter
between
the
and
myself
i
would
not
warn
him
of
his
danger
but
i
would
avert
tragedy
at
all
costs
and
when
no
such
encounter
had
taken
place
and
raffles
and
i
were
fairly
on
our
way
to
willesden
that
i
think
was
still
my
honest
resolve
i
would
not
break
my
word
if
i
could
help
it
but
it
was
a
comfort
to
feel
that
i
could
break
it
if
i
liked
on
an
understood
penalty
alas
i
fear
my
good
intentions
were
tainted
with
a
devouring
curiosity
and
overlaid
by
the
fascination
which
goes
hand
in
hand
with
horror
i
have
a
poignant
recollection
of
the
hour
it
took
us
to
reach
the
house
we
walked
across
james
park
i
can
see
the
lights
now
bright
on
the
bridge
and
blurred
in
the
water
and
we
had
some
minutes
to
wait
for
the
last
train
to
willesden
it
left
at
i
remember
and
raffles
was
put
out
to
find
it
did
not
go
on
to
kensal
rise
we
had
to
get
out
at
willesden
junction
and
walk
on
through
the
streets
into
fairly
open
country
that
happened
to
be
quite
new
to
me
i
could
never
find
the
house
again
i
remember
however
that
we
were
on
a
dark
footpath
between
woods
and
fields
when
the
clocks
began
striking
twelve
surely
said
i
we
shall
find
him
in
bed
and
asleep
i
hope
we
do
said
raffles
grimly
then
you
mean
to
break
in
what
else
did
you
think
i
had
not
thought
about
it
at
all
the
ultimate
crime
had
monopolized
my
mind
beside
it
burglary
was
a
bagatelle
but
one
to
deprecate
none
the
less
i
saw
obvious
objections
the
man
was
au
fait
with
cracksmen
and
their
ways
he
would
certainly
have
firearms
and
might
be
the
first
to
use
them
i
could
wish
nothing
better
said
raffles
then
it
will
be
man
to
man
and
devil
take
the
worst
shot
you
do
suppose
i
prefer
foul
play
to
fair
do
you
but
die
he
must
by
one
or
the
other
or
it
a
long
stretch
for
you
and
me
better
that
than
this
then
stay
where
you
are
my
good
fellow
i
told
you
i
did
want
you
and
this
is
the
house
so
i
could
see
no
house
at
all
only
the
angle
of
a
high
wall
rising
solitary
in
the
night
with
the
starlight
glittering
on
battlements
of
broken
glass
and
in
the
wall
a
tall
green
gate
bristling
with
spikes
and
showing
a
front
for
in
the
feeble
rays
an
outlying
cast
across
the
road
it
seemed
to
me
a
road
of
with
but
this
one
house
built
all
by
itself
at
one
end
but
the
night
was
too
dark
for
more
than
a
mere
impression
raffles
however
had
seen
the
place
by
daylight
and
had
come
prepared
for
the
special
obstacles
already
he
was
reaching
up
and
putting
champagne
corks
on
the
spikes
and
in
another
moment
he
had
his
folded
across
the
corks
i
stepped
back
as
he
raised
himself
and
saw
a
little
pyramid
of
slates
snip
the
sky
above
the
gate
as
he
squirmed
over
i
ran
forward
and
had
my
own
weight
on
the
spikes
and
corks
and
when
he
gave
the
latter
a
tug
coming
after
all
rather
take
care
then
the
place
is
all
and
springs
it
no
soft
thing
this
there
stand
still
while
i
take
off
the
corks
the
garden
was
very
small
and
new
with
a
still
in
separate
sods
but
a
quantity
of
laurels
stuck
into
the
raw
clay
beds
bells
in
themselves
as
raffles
whispered
there
nothing
else
rustles
so
cunning
old
beast
and
we
gave
them
a
wide
berth
as
we
crept
across
the
grass
he
gone
to
bed
i
do
think
so
bunny
i
believe
he
seen
us
why
i
saw
a
light
where
downstairs
for
an
instant
when
i
his
whisper
died
away
he
had
seen
the
light
again
and
so
had
i
it
lay
like
a
golden
rod
under
the
and
vanished
it
reappeared
like
a
gold
thread
under
the
lintel
and
vanished
for
good
we
heard
the
stairs
creak
creak
and
cease
also
for
good
we
neither
saw
nor
heard
any
more
though
we
stood
waiting
on
the
grass
till
our
feet
were
soaked
with
the
dew
i
going
in
said
raffles
at
last
i
do
believe
he
saw
us
at
all
i
wish
he
had
this
way
we
trod
gingerly
on
the
path
but
the
gravel
stuck
to
our
wet
soles
and
grated
horribly
in
a
little
tiled
veranda
with
a
glass
door
leading
within
it
was
through
this
glass
that
raffles
had
first
seen
the
light
and
he
now
proceeded
to
take
out
a
pane
with
the
diamond
the
pot
of
treacle
and
the
sheet
of
brown
paper
which
were
seldom
omitted
from
his
impedimenta
nor
did
he
dispense
with
my
own
assistance
though
he
may
have
accepted
it
as
instinctively
as
it
was
proffered
in
any
case
it
was
these
fingers
that
helped
to
spread
the
treacle
on
the
brown
paper
and
pressed
the
latter
to
the
glass
until
the
diamond
had
completed
its
circuit
and
the
pane
fell
gently
back
into
our
hands
raffles
now
inserted
his
hand
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
by
making
a
long
arm
succeeded
in
drawing
the
bolt
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
it
proved
to
be
the
only
one
and
the
door
opened
though
not
very
wide
what
that
said
raffles
as
something
crunched
beneath
his
feet
on
the
very
threshold
a
pair
of
spectacles
i
whispered
picking
them
up
i
was
still
fingering
the
broken
lenses
and
the
bent
rims
when
raffles
tripped
and
almost
fell
with
a
gasping
cry
that
he
made
no
effort
to
restrain
hush
man
hush
i
entreated
under
my
breath
he
hear
you
for
answer
his
teeth
chattered
even
his
and
i
heard
him
fumbling
with
his
matches
no
bunny
he
wo
hear
us
whispered
raffles
presently
and
he
rose
from
his
knees
and
lit
a
gas
as
the
match
burnt
down
angus
baird
was
lying
on
his
own
floor
dead
with
his
gray
hairs
glued
together
by
his
blood
near
him
a
poker
with
the
black
end
glistening
in
a
corner
his
desk
ransacked
littered
a
clock
ticked
noisily
on
the
for
perhaps
a
hundred
seconds
there
was
no
other
sound
raffles
stood
very
still
staring
down
at
the
dead
as
a
man
might
stare
into
an
abyss
after
striding
blindly
to
its
brink
his
breath
came
audibly
through
wide
nostrils
he
made
no
other
sign
and
his
lips
seemed
sealed
that
light
said
i
hoarsely
the
light
we
saw
under
the
door
with
a
start
he
turned
to
me
it
true
i
had
forgotten
it
it
was
in
here
i
saw
it
first
he
must
be
upstairs
still
if
he
is
we
soon
rout
him
out
come
on
instead
i
laid
a
hand
upon
his
arm
imploring
him
to
reflect
that
his
enemy
was
dead
now
that
we
should
certainly
be
involved
that
now
or
never
was
our
own
time
to
escape
he
shook
me
off
in
a
sudden
fury
of
impatience
a
reckless
contempt
in
his
eyes
and
bidding
me
save
my
own
skin
if
i
liked
he
once
more
turned
his
back
upon
me
and
this
time
left
me
half
resolved
to
take
him
at
his
word
had
he
forgotten
on
what
errand
he
himself
was
here
was
he
determined
that
this
night
should
end
in
black
disaster
as
i
asked
myself
these
questions
his
match
flared
in
the
hall
in
another
moment
the
stairs
were
creaking
under
his
feet
even
as
they
had
creaked
under
those
of
the
murderer
and
the
humane
instinct
that
inspired
him
in
defiance
of
his
risk
was
borne
in
also
upon
my
slower
sensibilities
could
we
let
the
murderer
go
my
answer
was
to
bound
up
the
creaking
stairs
and
to
overhaul
raffles
on
the
landing
but
three
doors
presented
themselves
the
first
opened
into
a
bedroom
with
the
bed
turned
down
but
undisturbed
the
second
room
was
empty
in
every
sense
the
third
door
was
locked
raffles
lit
the
landing
gas
he
in
there
said
he
cocking
his
revolver
do
you
remember
how
we
used
to
break
into
the
studies
at
school
here
goes
his
flat
foot
crashed
over
the
keyhole
the
lock
gave
the
door
flew
open
and
in
the
sudden
draught
the
landing
gas
heeled
over
like
a
cobble
in
a
squall
as
the
flame
righted
itself
i
saw
a
fixed
bath
two
knotted
together
an
open
window
a
cowering
figure
and
raffles
struck
aghast
on
the
threshold
jack
rutter
the
words
came
thick
and
slow
with
horror
and
in
horror
i
heard
myself
repeating
them
while
the
cowering
figure
by
the
bathroom
window
rose
gradually
erect
it
you
he
whispered
in
amazement
no
less
than
our
own
it
you
two
what
it
mean
raffles
i
saw
you
get
over
the
gate
a
bell
rang
the
place
is
full
of
them
then
you
broke
in
what
it
all
mean
we
may
tell
you
that
when
you
tell
us
what
in
god
name
you
done
rutter
done
what
have
i
done
the
unhappy
wretch
came
out
into
the
light
with
bloodshot
blinking
eyes
and
a
bloody
you
know
you
seen
but
i
tell
you
if
you
like
i
killed
a
robber
that
all
i
killed
a
robber
a
usurer
a
jackal
a
blackmailer
the
cleverest
and
the
cruellest
villain
unhung
i
ready
to
hang
for
him
i
kill
him
again
and
he
looked
us
fiercely
in
the
face
a
fine
defiance
in
his
dissipated
eyes
his
breast
heaving
his
jaw
like
a
rock
shall
i
tell
you
how
it
happened
he
went
passionately
on
made
my
life
a
hell
these
weeks
and
months
past
you
may
know
that
a
perfect
hell
well
i
met
him
in
bond
street
do
you
remember
when
i
met
you
fellows
he
was
twenty
yards
behind
you
he
was
on
your
tracks
raffles
he
saw
me
nod
to
you
and
stopped
me
and
asked
me
who
you
were
he
seemed
as
keen
as
knives
to
know
i
think
why
and
did
care
either
for
i
saw
my
chance
i
said
tell
him
all
about
you
if
he
give
me
a
private
interview
he
said
he
would
i
said
he
should
and
held
him
by
the
coat
by
the
time
i
let
him
go
you
were
out
of
sight
and
i
waited
where
i
was
till
he
came
back
in
despair
i
had
the
of
him
then
i
could
dictate
where
the
interview
should
be
and
i
made
him
take
me
home
with
him
still
swearing
to
tell
him
all
about
you
when
we
had
our
talk
well
when
we
got
here
i
made
him
give
me
something
to
eat
putting
him
off
and
off
and
about
ten
i
heard
the
gate
shut
i
waited
a
bit
and
then
asked
him
if
he
lived
alone
at
all
says
he
you
not
see
the
servant
i
said
i
seen
her
but
i
thought
i
heard
her
go
if
i
was
mistaken
no
doubt
she
would
come
when
she
was
called
and
i
yelled
three
times
at
the
top
of
my
voice
of
course
there
was
no
servant
to
come
i
knew
that
because
i
came
to
see
him
one
night
last
week
and
he
interviewed
me
himself
through
the
gate
but
would
open
it
well
when
i
had
done
yelling
and
not
a
soul
had
come
near
us
he
was
as
white
as
that
ceiling
then
i
told
him
we
could
have
our
chat
at
last
and
i
picked
the
poker
out
of
the
fender
and
told
him
how
he
robbed
me
but
by
god
he
should
rob
me
any
more
i
gave
him
three
minutes
to
write
and
sign
a
settlement
of
all
his
iniquitous
claims
against
me
or
have
his
brains
beaten
out
over
his
own
carpet
he
thought
a
minute
and
then
went
to
his
desk
for
pen
and
paper
in
two
seconds
he
was
round
like
lightning
with
a
revolver
and
i
went
for
him
he
fired
two
or
three
times
and
missed
you
can
find
the
holes
if
you
like
but
i
hit
him
every
time
my
god
i
was
like
a
savage
till
the
thing
was
done
and
then
i
did
care
i
went
through
his
desk
looking
for
my
own
bills
and
was
coming
away
when
you
turned
up
i
said
i
did
care
nor
do
i
but
i
was
going
to
give
myself
up
and
shall
still
so
you
see
i
give
you
fellows
much
trouble
he
was
done
and
there
we
stood
on
the
landing
of
the
lonely
house
the
low
thick
eager
voice
still
racing
and
ringing
through
our
ears
the
dead
man
below
and
in
front
of
us
his
impenitent
slayer
i
knew
to
whom
the
impenitence
would
appeal
when
he
had
heard
the
story
and
i
was
not
mistaken
that
all
rot
said
raffles
speaking
after
a
pause
we
let
you
give
yourself
up
you
stop
me
what
would
be
the
good
the
woman
saw
me
it
would
only
be
a
question
of
time
and
i
ca
face
waiting
to
be
taken
think
of
it
waiting
for
them
to
touch
you
on
the
shoulder
no
no
no
i
give
myself
up
and
get
it
over
his
speech
was
changed
he
faltered
floundered
it
was
as
though
a
clearer
perception
of
his
position
had
come
with
the
bare
idea
of
escape
from
it
but
listen
to
me
urged
raffles
we
here
at
our
peril
ourselves
we
broke
in
like
thieves
to
enforce
redress
for
a
grievance
very
like
your
own
but
do
you
see
we
took
out
a
pane
did
the
thing
like
regular
burglars
regular
burglars
will
get
the
credit
of
all
the
rest
you
mean
that
i
be
suspected
i
do
but
i
do
want
to
get
off
scotfree
cried
rutter
hysterically
i
killed
him
i
know
that
but
it
was
in
it
murder
i
must
own
up
and
take
the
consequences
i
shall
go
mad
if
i
do
his
hands
twitched
his
lips
quivered
the
tears
were
in
his
eyes
raffles
took
him
roughly
by
the
shoulder
look
here
you
fool
if
the
three
of
us
were
caught
here
now
do
you
know
what
those
consequences
would
be
we
should
swing
in
a
row
at
newgate
in
six
weeks
time
you
talk
as
though
we
were
sitting
in
a
club
do
you
know
it
one
in
the
morning
and
the
lights
on
and
a
dead
man
down
below
for
god
sake
pull
yourself
together
and
do
what
i
tell
you
or
you
a
dead
man
yourself
i
wish
i
was
one
rutter
sobbed
i
wish
i
had
his
revolver
to
blow
my
own
brains
out
it
lying
under
him
o
my
god
my
god
his
knees
knocked
together
the
frenzy
of
reaction
was
at
its
height
we
had
to
take
him
downstairs
between
us
and
so
through
the
front
door
out
into
the
open
air
all
was
still
outside
all
but
the
smothered
weeping
of
the
unstrung
wretch
upon
our
hands
raffles
returned
for
a
moment
to
the
house
then
all
was
dark
as
well
the
gate
opened
from
within
we
closed
it
carefully
behind
us
and
so
left
the
starlight
shining
on
broken
glass
and
polished
spikes
one
and
all
as
we
had
found
them
we
escaped
no
need
to
dwell
on
our
escape
our
murderer
seemed
set
upon
the
scaffold
drunk
with
his
deed
he
was
more
trouble
than
six
men
drunk
with
wine
again
and
again
we
threatened
to
leave
him
to
his
fate
to
wash
our
hands
of
him
but
incredible
and
unmerited
luck
was
with
the
three
of
us
not
a
soul
did
we
meet
between
that
and
willesden
and
of
those
who
saw
us
later
did
one
think
of
the
two
young
men
with
crooked
white
ties
supporting
a
third
in
a
seemingly
unmistakable
condition
when
the
evening
papers
apprised
the
town
of
a
terrible
tragedy
at
kensal
rise
we
walked
to
maida
vale
and
thence
drove
openly
to
my
rooms
but
i
alone
went
upstairs
the
other
two
proceeded
to
the
albany
and
i
saw
no
more
of
raffles
for
hours
he
was
not
at
his
rooms
when
i
called
in
the
morning
he
had
left
no
word
when
he
reappeared
the
papers
were
full
of
the
murder
and
the
man
who
had
committed
it
was
on
the
wide
atlantic
a
steerage
passenger
from
liverpool
to
new
york
there
was
no
arguing
with
him
so
raffles
told
me
either
he
must
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
or
flee
the
country
so
i
rigged
him
up
at
the
studio
and
we
took
the
first
train
to
liverpool
nothing
would
induce
him
to
sit
tight
and
enjoy
the
situation
as
i
should
have
endeavored
to
do
in
his
place
and
it
just
as
well
i
went
to
his
diggings
to
destroy
some
papers
and
what
do
you
think
i
found
the
police
in
possession
there
a
warrant
out
against
him
already
the
idiots
think
that
window
was
genuine
and
the
warrant
out
it
wo
be
my
fault
if
it
ever
served
nor
after
all
these
years
can
i
think
it
will
be
mine
nine
points
of
the
law
well
said
raffles
what
do
you
make
of
it
i
read
the
advertisement
once
more
before
replying
it
was
in
the
last
column
of
the
daily
telegraph
and
it
ran
two
thousand
pounds
reward
the
above
sum
may
be
earned
by
any
one
qualified
to
undertake
delicate
mission
and
prepared
to
run
certain
apply
by
telegram
security
london
i
think
said
i
it
the
most
extraordinary
advertisement
that
ever
got
into
print
raffles
smiled
not
quite
all
that
bunny
still
extraordinary
enough
i
grant
you
look
at
the
figure
it
is
certainly
large
and
the
mission
and
the
risk
yes
the
combination
is
frank
to
say
the
least
of
it
but
the
really
original
point
is
requiring
applications
by
telegram
to
a
telegraphic
address
there
something
in
the
fellow
who
thought
of
that
and
something
in
his
game
with
one
word
he
chokes
off
the
million
who
answer
an
advertisement
every
day
when
they
can
raise
the
stamp
my
answer
cost
me
five
bob
but
then
i
prepaid
another
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
applied
rather
said
raffles
i
want
two
thousand
pounds
as
much
as
any
man
put
your
own
name
well
no
bunny
i
did
in
point
of
fact
i
smell
something
interesting
and
illegal
and
you
know
what
a
cautious
chap
i
am
i
signed
myself
glasspool
care
of
hickey
conduit
street
that
my
tailor
and
after
sending
the
wire
i
went
round
and
told
him
what
to
expect
he
promised
to
send
the
reply
along
the
moment
it
came
i
should
be
surprised
if
that
it
and
he
was
gone
before
a
on
the
outer
door
had
done
ringing
through
the
rooms
to
return
next
minute
with
an
open
telegram
and
a
face
full
of
news
what
do
you
think
said
he
security
that
fellow
addenbrooke
the
lawyer
and
he
wants
to
see
me
instanter
do
you
know
him
then
merely
by
repute
i
only
hope
he
does
know
me
he
the
chap
who
got
six
weeks
for
sailing
too
close
to
the
wind
in
the
case
everybody
wondered
why
he
was
struck
off
the
rolls
instead
of
that
he
got
a
practice
on
the
seamy
side
and
every
blackguard
with
half
a
case
takes
it
straight
to
bennett
addenbrooke
he
probably
the
one
man
who
would
have
the
cheek
to
put
in
an
advertisement
like
that
and
the
one
man
who
could
do
it
without
exciting
suspicion
it
simply
in
his
line
but
you
may
be
sure
there
something
shady
at
the
bottom
of
it
the
odd
thing
is
that
i
have
long
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
addenbrooke
myself
if
accidents
should
happen
and
you
going
to
him
now
this
minute
said
raffles
brushing
his
hat
and
so
are
you
but
i
came
in
to
drag
you
out
to
lunch
you
shall
lunch
with
me
when
we
seen
this
fellow
come
on
bunny
and
we
choose
your
name
on
the
way
mine
glasspool
and
do
you
forget
it
bennett
addenbrooke
occupied
substantial
offices
in
wellington
street
strand
and
was
out
when
we
arrived
but
he
had
only
just
gone
over
the
way
to
the
court
and
five
minutes
sufficed
to
produce
a
brisk
man
with
a
very
confident
rather
festive
air
and
black
eyes
that
opened
wide
at
the
sight
of
raffles
glasspool
exclaimed
the
lawyer
my
name
said
raffles
with
dry
effrontery
not
up
at
lord
however
said
the
other
slyly
my
dear
sir
i
have
seen
you
take
far
too
many
wickets
to
make
any
mistake
for
a
single
moment
raffles
looked
venomous
then
he
shrugged
and
smiled
and
the
smile
grew
into
a
little
cynical
chuckle
so
you
have
bowled
me
out
in
my
turn
said
he
well
i
do
think
there
anything
to
explain
i
am
harder
up
than
i
wished
to
admit
under
my
own
name
that
all
and
i
want
that
thousand
pounds
reward
two
thousand
said
the
solicitor
and
the
man
who
is
not
above
an
alias
happens
to
be
just
the
sort
of
man
i
want
so
do
let
that
worry
you
my
dear
sir
the
matter
however
is
of
a
strictly
private
and
confidential
character
and
he
looked
very
hard
at
me
quite
so
said
raffles
but
there
was
something
about
a
risk
a
certain
risk
is
involved
then
surely
three
heads
will
be
better
than
two
i
said
i
wanted
that
thousand
pounds
my
friend
here
wants
the
other
we
are
both
cursedly
hard
up
and
we
go
into
this
thing
together
or
not
at
all
must
you
have
his
name
too
i
should
give
him
my
real
one
bunny
addenbrooke
raised
his
eyebrows
over
the
card
i
found
for
him
then
he
drummed
upon
it
with
his
and
his
embarrassment
expressed
itself
in
a
puzzled
smile
the
fact
is
i
find
myself
in
a
difficulty
he
confessed
at
last
yours
is
the
first
reply
i
have
received
people
who
can
afford
to
send
long
telegrams
do
rush
to
the
advertisements
in
the
daily
telegraph
but
on
the
other
hand
i
was
not
quite
prepared
to
hear
from
men
like
yourselves
candidly
and
on
consideration
i
am
not
sure
that
you
are
the
stamp
of
men
for
me
men
who
belong
to
good
clubs
i
rather
intended
to
appeal
to
the
er
adventurous
classes
we
are
adventurers
said
raffles
gravely
but
you
respect
the
law
the
black
eyes
gleamed
shrewdly
we
are
not
professional
rogues
if
that
what
you
mean
said
raffles
smiling
but
on
our
we
are
we
would
do
a
good
deal
for
a
thousand
pounds
apiece
eh
bunny
anything
i
murmured
the
solicitor
rapped
his
desk
i
tell
you
what
i
want
you
to
do
you
can
but
refuse
illegal
but
it
illegality
in
a
good
cause
that
the
risk
and
my
client
is
prepared
to
pay
for
it
he
will
pay
for
the
attempt
in
case
of
failure
the
money
is
as
good
as
yours
once
you
consent
to
run
the
risk
my
client
is
sir
bernard
debenham
of
broom
hall
esher
i
know
his
son
i
remarked
raffles
knew
him
too
but
said
nothing
and
his
eye
drooped
disapproval
in
my
direction
bennett
addenbrooke
turned
to
me
then
said
he
you
have
the
privilege
of
knowing
one
of
the
most
complete
young
about
town
and
the
fons
et
origo
of
the
whole
trouble
as
you
know
the
son
you
may
know
the
father
too
at
all
events
by
reputation
and
in
that
case
i
need
tell
you
that
he
is
a
very
peculiar
man
he
lives
alone
in
a
storehouse
of
treasures
which
no
eyes
but
his
ever
behold
he
is
said
to
have
the
finest
collection
of
pictures
in
the
south
of
england
though
nobody
ever
sees
them
to
judge
pictures
fiddles
and
furniture
are
his
hobby
and
he
is
undoubtedly
very
eccentric
nor
can
one
deny
that
there
has
been
considerable
eccentricity
in
his
treatment
of
his
son
for
years
sir
bernard
paid
his
debts
and
the
other
day
without
the
slightest
warning
not
only
refused
to
do
so
any
more
but
absolutely
stopped
the
lad
allowance
well
i
tell
you
what
has
happened
but
first
of
all
you
must
know
or
you
may
remember
that
i
appeared
for
young
debenham
in
a
little
scrape
he
got
into
a
year
or
two
ago
i
got
him
off
all
right
and
sir
bernard
paid
me
handsomely
on
the
nail
and
no
more
did
i
hear
or
see
of
either
of
them
until
one
day
last
week
the
lawyer
drew
his
chair
nearer
ours
and
leant
forward
with
a
hand
on
either
knee
on
tuesday
of
last
week
i
had
a
telegram
from
sir
bernard
i
was
to
go
to
him
at
once
i
found
him
waiting
for
me
in
the
drive
without
a
word
he
led
me
to
the
which
was
locked
and
darkened
drew
up
a
blind
and
stood
simply
pointing
to
an
empty
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
could
get
a
word
out
of
him
then
at
last
he
told
me
that
that
frame
had
contained
one
of
the
rarest
and
most
valuable
pictures
in
england
in
the
world
an
original
velasquez
i
have
checked
this
said
the
lawyer
and
it
seems
literally
true
the
picture
was
a
portrait
of
the
infanta
maria
teresa
said
to
be
one
of
the
artist
greatest
works
second
only
to
another
portrait
of
one
of
the
popes
in
rome
so
they
told
me
at
the
national
gallery
where
they
had
its
history
by
heart
they
say
there
that
the
picture
is
practically
priceless
and
young
debenham
has
sold
it
for
five
thousand
pounds
the
deuce
he
has
said
raffles
i
inquired
who
had
bought
it
a
queensland
legislator
of
the
name
of
craggs
the
hon
john
montagu
craggs
to
give
him
his
full
title
not
that
we
knew
anything
about
him
on
tuesday
last
we
did
even
know
for
certain
that
young
debenham
had
stolen
the
picture
but
he
had
gone
down
for
money
on
the
monday
evening
had
been
refused
and
it
was
plain
enough
that
he
had
helped
himself
in
this
way
he
had
threatened
revenge
and
this
was
it
indeed
when
i
hunted
him
up
in
town
on
the
tuesday
night
he
confessed
as
much
in
the
most
brazen
manner
imaginable
but
he
would
tell
me
who
was
the
purchaser
and
finding
out
took
the
rest
of
the
week
but
i
did
find
out
and
a
nice
time
i
had
of
it
ever
since
backwards
and
forwards
between
esher
and
the
metropole
where
the
queenslander
is
staying
sometimes
twice
a
day
threats
offers
prayers
entreaties
not
one
of
them
a
bit
of
good
but
said
raffles
surely
it
a
clear
case
the
sale
was
illegal
you
can
pay
him
back
his
money
and
force
him
to
give
the
picture
up
exactly
but
not
without
an
action
and
a
public
scandal
and
that
my
client
declines
to
face
he
would
rather
lose
even
his
picture
than
have
the
whole
thing
get
into
the
papers
he
has
disowned
his
son
but
he
will
not
disgrace
him
yet
his
picture
he
must
have
by
hook
or
crook
and
there
the
rub
i
am
to
get
it
back
by
fair
means
or
foul
he
gives
me
carte
blanche
in
the
matter
and
i
verily
believe
would
throw
in
a
blank
check
if
asked
he
offered
one
to
the
queenslander
but
craggs
simply
tore
it
in
two
the
one
old
boy
is
as
much
a
character
as
the
other
and
between
the
two
of
them
i
at
my
end
so
you
put
that
advertisement
in
the
paper
said
raffles
in
the
dry
tones
he
had
adopted
throughout
the
interview
as
a
last
resort
i
did
and
you
wish
us
to
steal
this
picture
it
was
magnificently
said
the
lawyer
flushed
from
his
hair
to
his
collar
i
knew
you
were
not
the
men
he
groaned
i
never
thought
of
men
of
your
stamp
but
it
not
stealing
he
exclaimed
heatedly
recovering
stolen
property
besides
sir
bernard
will
pay
him
his
five
thousand
as
soon
as
he
has
the
picture
and
you
see
old
craggs
will
be
just
as
loath
to
let
it
come
out
as
sir
bernard
himself
no
no
it
an
enterprise
an
adventure
if
you
like
but
not
stealing
you
yourself
mentioned
the
law
murmured
raffles
and
the
risk
i
added
we
pay
for
that
he
said
once
more
but
not
enough
said
raffles
shaking
his
head
my
good
sir
consider
what
it
means
to
us
you
spoke
of
those
clubs
we
should
not
only
get
kicked
out
of
them
but
put
in
prison
like
common
burglars
it
true
we
hard
up
but
it
simply
is
worth
it
at
the
price
double
your
stakes
and
i
for
one
am
your
man
addenbrooke
wavered
do
you
think
you
could
bring
it
off
we
could
try
but
you
have
no
experience
well
hardly
and
you
would
really
run
the
risk
for
four
thousand
pounds
raffles
looked
at
me
i
nodded
we
would
said
he
and
blow
the
odds
it
more
than
i
can
ask
my
client
to
pay
said
addenbrooke
growing
firm
then
it
more
than
you
can
expect
us
to
risk
you
are
in
earnest
god
wot
say
three
thousand
if
you
succeed
four
is
our
figure
mr
addenbrooke
then
i
think
it
should
be
nothing
if
you
fail
doubles
or
quits
cried
raffles
well
that
sporting
done
addenbrooke
opened
his
lips
half
rose
then
sat
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
long
and
shrewdly
at
raffles
never
once
at
me
i
know
your
bowling
said
he
reflectively
i
go
up
to
whenever
i
want
an
hour
real
rest
and
i
seen
you
bowl
again
and
again
yes
and
take
the
best
wickets
in
england
on
a
plumb
pitch
i
do
forget
the
last
gentleman
and
players
i
was
there
you
up
to
every
trick
every
one
i
inclined
to
think
that
if
anybody
could
bowl
out
this
old
australian
damme
i
believe
you
my
very
man
the
bargain
was
clinched
at
the
cafe
royal
where
bennett
addenbrooke
insisted
on
playing
host
at
an
extravagant
luncheon
i
remember
that
he
took
his
whack
of
champagne
with
the
nervous
freedom
of
a
man
at
high
pressure
and
have
no
doubt
i
kept
him
in
countenance
by
an
equal
indulgence
but
raffles
ever
an
exemplar
in
such
matters
was
more
abstemious
even
than
his
wont
and
very
poor
company
to
boot
i
can
see
him
now
his
eyes
in
his
plate
thinking
thinking
i
can
see
the
solicitor
glancing
from
him
to
me
in
an
apprehension
of
which
i
did
my
best
to
disabuse
him
by
reassuring
looks
at
the
close
raffles
apologized
for
his
preoccupation
called
for
an
and
announced
his
intention
of
catching
the
to
esher
you
must
excuse
me
addenbrooke
said
he
but
i
have
my
own
idea
and
for
the
moment
i
should
much
prefer
to
keep
it
to
myself
it
may
end
in
fizzle
so
i
would
rather
not
speak
about
it
to
either
of
you
just
yet
but
speak
to
sir
bernard
i
must
so
will
you
write
me
one
line
to
him
on
your
card
of
course
if
you
wish
you
must
come
down
with
me
and
hear
what
i
say
but
i
really
do
see
much
point
in
it
and
as
usual
raffles
had
his
way
though
bennett
addenbrooke
showed
some
temper
when
he
was
gone
and
i
myself
shared
his
annoyance
to
no
small
extent
i
could
only
tell
him
that
it
was
in
the
nature
of
raffles
to
be
and
secretive
but
that
no
man
of
my
acquaintance
had
half
his
audacity
and
determination
that
i
for
my
part
would
trust
him
through
and
through
and
let
him
gang
his
own
gait
every
time
more
i
dared
not
say
even
to
remove
those
chill
misgivings
with
which
i
knew
that
the
lawyer
went
his
way
that
day
i
saw
no
more
of
raffles
but
a
telegram
reached
me
when
i
was
dressing
for
dinner
be
in
your
rooms
from
noon
and
keep
rest
of
day
clear
raffles
it
had
been
sent
off
from
waterloo
at
so
raffles
was
back
in
town
at
an
earlier
stage
of
our
relations
i
should
have
hunted
him
up
then
and
there
but
now
i
knew
better
his
telegram
meant
that
he
had
no
desire
for
my
society
that
night
or
the
following
forenoon
that
when
he
wanted
me
i
should
see
him
soon
enough
and
see
him
i
did
towards
one
next
day
i
was
watching
for
him
from
my
window
in
mount
street
when
he
drove
up
furiously
in
a
hansom
and
jumped
out
without
a
word
to
the
man
i
met
him
next
minute
at
the
lift
gates
and
he
fairly
pushed
me
back
into
my
rooms
five
minutes
bunny
he
cried
not
a
moment
more
and
he
tore
off
his
coat
before
flinging
himself
into
the
nearest
chair
i
fairly
on
the
rush
he
panted
having
the
very
devil
of
a
time
not
a
word
till
i
tell
you
all
i
done
i
settled
my
plan
of
campaign
yesterday
at
lunch
the
first
thing
was
to
get
in
with
this
man
craggs
you
ca
break
into
a
place
like
the
metropole
it
got
to
be
done
from
the
inside
problem
one
how
to
get
at
the
fellow
only
one
sort
of
pretext
would
do
it
must
be
something
to
do
with
this
blessed
picture
so
that
i
might
see
where
he
got
it
and
all
that
well
i
could
go
and
ask
to
see
it
out
of
curiosity
and
i
go
as
a
second
representative
of
the
other
old
chap
and
it
was
thinking
how
i
could
go
that
made
me
such
a
bear
at
lunch
but
i
saw
my
way
before
we
got
up
if
i
could
only
lay
hold
of
a
copy
of
the
picture
i
might
ask
leave
to
go
and
compare
it
with
the
original
so
down
i
went
to
esher
to
find
out
if
there
was
a
copy
in
existence
and
was
at
broom
hall
for
one
hour
and
a
half
yesterday
afternoon
there
was
no
copy
there
but
they
must
exist
for
sir
bernard
himself
there
there
has
allowed
a
couple
to
be
made
since
the
picture
has
been
in
his
possession
he
hunted
up
the
addresses
and
the
rest
of
the
evening
i
spent
in
hunting
up
the
painters
themselves
but
their
work
had
been
done
on
commission
one
copy
had
gone
out
of
the
country
and
i
still
on
the
track
of
the
other
then
you
have
seen
craggs
yet
seen
him
and
made
friends
with
him
and
if
possible
he
the
funnier
old
cuss
of
the
two
but
you
should
study
both
i
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
this
morning
went
in
and
lied
like
ananias
and
it
was
just
as
well
i
did
the
old
ruffian
sails
for
australia
by
boat
i
told
him
a
man
wanted
to
sell
me
a
copy
of
the
celebrated
infanta
maria
teresa
of
velasquez
that
i
been
down
to
the
supposed
owner
of
the
picture
only
to
find
that
he
had
just
sold
it
to
him
you
should
have
seen
his
face
when
i
told
him
that
he
grinned
all
round
his
wicked
old
head
old
debenham
admit
the
sale
says
he
and
when
i
said
he
had
he
chuckled
to
himself
for
about
five
minutes
he
was
so
pleased
that
he
did
just
what
i
hoped
he
would
do
he
showed
me
the
great
picture
luckily
it
is
by
any
means
a
large
one
also
the
case
he
got
it
in
it
an
iron
in
which
he
brought
over
the
plans
of
his
land
in
brisbane
he
wants
to
know
who
would
suspect
it
of
containing
an
old
master
too
but
he
had
it
fitted
with
a
new
chubb
lock
and
i
managed
to
take
an
interest
in
the
key
while
he
was
gloating
over
the
canvas
i
had
the
wax
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
and
i
shall
make
my
duplicate
this
afternoon
raffles
looked
at
his
watch
and
jumped
up
saying
he
had
given
me
a
minute
too
much
by
the
way
he
added
you
got
to
dine
with
him
at
the
metropole
i
yes
do
look
so
scared
both
of
us
are
invited
i
swore
you
were
dining
with
me
i
accepted
for
us
both
but
i
be
there
his
clear
eye
was
upon
me
bright
with
meaning
and
with
mischief
i
implored
him
to
tell
me
what
his
meaning
was
you
will
dine
in
his
private
said
raffles
it
adjoins
his
bedroom
you
must
keep
him
sitting
as
long
as
possible
bunny
and
talking
all
the
time
in
a
flash
i
saw
his
plan
you
going
for
the
picture
while
we
at
dinner
i
am
if
he
hears
you
he
but
if
he
does
and
i
fairly
trembled
at
the
thought
if
he
does
said
raffles
there
will
be
a
collision
that
all
revolver
would
be
out
of
place
in
the
metropole
but
i
shall
certainly
take
a
but
it
ghastly
i
cried
to
sit
and
talk
to
an
utter
stranger
and
to
know
that
you
at
work
in
the
next
room
two
thousand
apiece
said
raffles
quietly
upon
my
soul
i
believe
i
shall
give
it
away
not
you
bunny
i
know
you
better
than
you
know
yourself
he
put
on
his
coat
and
his
hat
what
time
have
i
to
be
there
i
asked
him
with
a
groan
quarter
to
eight
there
will
be
a
telegram
from
me
saying
i
turn
up
he
a
terror
to
talk
you
have
no
difficulty
in
keeping
the
ball
rolling
but
head
him
off
his
picture
for
all
you
worth
if
he
offers
to
show
it
to
you
say
you
must
go
he
locked
up
the
case
elaborately
this
afternoon
and
there
no
earthly
reason
why
he
should
unlock
it
again
in
this
hemisphere
where
shall
i
find
you
when
i
get
away
i
shall
be
down
at
esher
i
hope
to
catch
the
but
surely
i
can
see
you
again
this
afternoon
i
cried
in
a
ferment
for
his
hand
was
on
the
door
i
not
half
coached
up
yet
i
know
i
shall
make
a
mess
of
it
not
you
he
said
again
but
shall
if
i
waste
any
more
time
i
got
a
deuce
of
a
lot
of
rushing
about
to
do
yet
you
wo
find
me
at
my
rooms
why
not
come
down
to
esher
yourself
by
the
last
train
that
it
down
you
come
with
the
latest
news
i
tell
old
debenham
to
expect
you
he
shall
give
us
both
a
bed
by
jove
he
wo
be
able
to
do
us
too
well
if
he
got
his
picture
if
i
groaned
as
he
nodded
his
adieu
and
he
left
me
limp
with
apprehension
sick
with
fear
in
a
perfectly
pitiable
condition
of
pure
for
after
all
i
had
only
to
act
my
part
unless
raffles
failed
where
he
never
did
fail
unless
raffles
the
neat
and
noiseless
was
for
once
clumsy
and
inept
all
i
had
to
do
was
indeed
to
smile
and
smile
and
be
a
villain
i
practiced
that
smile
half
the
afternoon
i
rehearsed
putative
parts
in
hypothetical
conversations
i
got
up
stories
i
dipped
in
a
book
on
queensland
at
the
club
and
at
last
it
was
and
i
was
making
my
bow
to
a
somewhat
elderly
man
with
a
small
bald
head
and
a
retreating
brow
so
you
raffles
friend
said
he
overhauling
me
rather
rudely
with
his
light
small
eyes
seen
anything
of
him
expected
him
early
to
show
me
something
but
he
never
come
no
more
evidently
had
his
telegram
and
my
troubles
were
beginning
early
i
said
i
had
not
seen
raffles
since
one
telling
the
truth
with
unction
while
i
could
even
as
we
spoke
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
it
was
the
telegram
at
last
and
after
reading
it
himself
the
queenslander
handed
it
to
me
called
out
of
town
he
grumbled
sudden
illness
of
near
relative
what
near
relatives
has
he
got
i
knew
of
none
and
for
an
instant
i
quailed
before
the
perils
of
invention
then
i
replied
that
i
had
never
met
any
of
his
people
and
again
felt
fortified
by
my
veracity
thought
you
were
bosom
pals
said
he
with
as
i
imagined
a
gleam
of
suspicion
in
his
crafty
little
eyes
only
in
town
said
i
i
never
been
to
his
place
well
he
growled
i
suppose
it
ca
be
helped
do
know
why
he
could
come
and
have
his
dinner
first
like
to
see
the
go
to
without
my
dinner
it
a
billet
if
you
ask
me
well
must
just
dine
without
him
and
he
have
to
buy
his
pig
in
a
poke
after
all
mind
touching
that
bell
suppose
you
know
what
he
came
to
see
me
about
sorry
i
see
him
again
for
his
own
sake
i
liked
raffles
took
to
him
amazingly
he
a
cynic
like
cynics
one
myself
rank
bad
form
of
his
mother
or
his
aunt
and
i
hope
she
will
go
and
kick
the
bucket
i
connect
these
specimens
of
his
conversation
though
they
were
doubtless
detached
at
the
time
and
interspersed
with
remarks
of
mine
here
and
there
they
filled
the
interval
until
dinner
was
served
and
they
gave
me
an
impression
of
the
man
which
his
every
subsequent
utterance
confirmed
it
was
an
impression
which
did
away
with
all
remorse
for
my
treacherous
presence
at
his
table
he
was
that
terrible
type
the
silly
cynic
his
aim
a
caustic
commentary
on
all
things
and
all
men
his
achievement
mere
vulgar
irreverence
and
unintelligent
scorn
and
he
had
on
his
own
showing
fluked
into
fortune
on
a
rise
in
land
yet
cunning
he
possessed
as
well
as
malice
and
he
chuckled
till
he
choked
over
the
misfortunes
of
less
astute
speculators
in
the
same
boom
even
now
i
can
not
feel
much
compunction
for
my
behavior
by
the
hon
craggs
but
never
shall
i
forget
the
private
agonies
of
the
situation
the
listening
to
my
host
with
one
ear
and
for
raffles
with
the
other
once
i
heard
him
though
the
rooms
were
not
divided
by
the
and
though
the
door
that
did
divide
them
was
not
only
shut
but
richly
curtained
i
could
have
sworn
i
heard
him
once
i
spilt
my
wine
and
laughed
at
the
top
of
my
voice
at
some
coarse
sally
of
my
host
and
i
heard
nothing
more
though
my
ears
were
on
the
strain
but
later
to
my
horror
when
the
waiter
had
finally
withdrawn
craggs
himself
sprang
up
and
rushed
to
his
bedroom
without
a
word
i
sat
like
stone
till
he
returned
thought
i
heard
a
door
go
he
said
must
have
been
mistaken
imagination
gave
me
quite
a
turn
raffles
tell
you
priceless
treasure
i
got
in
there
it
was
the
picture
at
last
up
to
this
point
i
had
kept
him
to
queensland
and
the
making
of
his
pile
i
tried
to
get
him
back
there
now
but
in
vain
he
was
reminded
of
his
great
possession
i
said
that
raffles
had
just
mentioned
it
and
that
set
him
off
with
the
confidential
garrulity
of
a
man
who
has
dined
too
well
he
plunged
into
his
darling
topic
and
i
looked
past
him
at
the
clock
it
was
only
a
quarter
to
ten
in
common
decency
i
could
not
go
yet
so
there
i
sat
we
were
still
at
port
and
learnt
what
had
originally
fired
my
host
ambition
to
possess
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
a
real
genuine
old
master
it
was
to
go
one
better
than
some
rival
legislator
of
pictorial
proclivities
but
even
an
epitome
of
his
monologue
would
be
so
much
weariness
suffice
it
that
it
ended
inevitably
in
the
invitation
i
had
dreaded
all
the
evening
but
you
must
see
it
next
room
this
way
is
it
packed
up
i
inquired
hastily
lock
and
key
that
all
pray
do
trouble
i
urged
trouble
be
hanged
said
he
come
along
and
all
at
once
i
saw
that
to
resist
him
further
would
be
to
heap
suspicion
upon
myself
against
the
moment
of
impending
discovery
i
therefore
followed
him
into
his
bedroom
without
further
protest
and
suffered
him
first
to
show
me
the
iron
which
stood
in
one
corner
he
took
a
crafty
pride
in
this
receptacle
and
i
thought
he
would
never
cease
descanting
on
its
innocent
appearance
and
its
lock
it
seemed
an
interminable
age
before
the
key
was
in
the
latter
then
the
ward
clicked
and
my
pulse
stood
still
by
jove
i
cried
next
instant
the
canvas
was
in
its
place
among
the
maps
thought
it
would
knock
you
said
craggs
drawing
it
out
and
unrolling
it
for
my
benefit
grand
thing
ai
it
would
think
it
had
been
painted
two
hundred
and
thirty
years
it
has
though
my
word
old
johnson
face
will
be
a
treat
when
he
sees
it
wo
go
bragging
about
his
pictures
much
more
why
this
one
worth
all
the
pictures
in
colony
o
queensland
put
together
worth
fifty
thousand
pounds
my
boy
and
i
got
it
for
five
he
dug
me
in
the
ribs
and
seemed
in
the
mood
for
further
confidences
my
appearance
checked
him
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
if
you
take
it
like
that
he
chuckled
how
will
old
johnson
take
it
go
out
and
hang
himself
to
his
own
i
hope
heaven
knows
what
i
contrived
to
say
at
last
struck
speechless
first
by
my
relief
i
continued
silent
from
a
very
different
cause
a
new
tangle
of
emotions
tied
my
tongue
raffles
had
failed
raffles
had
failed
could
i
not
succeed
was
it
too
late
was
there
no
way
so
long
he
said
taking
a
last
look
at
the
canvas
before
he
rolled
it
up
so
long
till
we
get
to
brisbane
the
flutter
i
was
in
as
he
closed
the
case
for
the
last
time
he
went
on
as
his
keys
jingled
back
into
his
pocket
it
goes
straight
into
the
on
board
for
the
last
time
if
i
could
but
send
him
out
to
australia
with
only
its
legitimate
contents
in
his
precious
if
i
could
but
succeed
where
raffles
had
failed
we
returned
to
the
other
room
i
have
no
notion
how
long
he
talked
or
what
about
whiskey
and
became
the
order
of
the
hour
i
scarcely
touched
it
but
he
drank
copiously
and
before
eleven
i
left
him
incoherent
and
the
last
train
for
esher
was
the
out
of
waterloo
i
took
a
hansom
to
my
rooms
i
was
back
at
the
hotel
in
thirteen
minutes
i
walked
upstairs
the
corridor
was
empty
i
stood
an
instant
on
the
threshold
heard
a
snore
within
and
admitted
myself
softly
with
my
gentleman
own
key
which
it
had
been
a
very
simple
matter
to
take
away
with
me
craggs
never
moved
he
was
stretched
on
the
sofa
fast
asleep
but
not
fast
enough
for
me
i
saturated
my
handkerchief
with
the
chloroform
i
had
brought
and
laid
it
gently
over
his
mouth
two
or
three
stertorous
breaths
and
the
man
was
a
log
i
removed
the
handkerchief
i
extracted
the
keys
from
his
pocket
in
less
than
five
minutes
i
put
them
back
after
winding
the
picture
about
my
body
beneath
my
inverness
cape
i
took
some
whiskey
and
before
i
went
the
train
was
easily
caught
so
easily
that
i
trembled
for
ten
minutes
in
my
smoking
carriage
in
terror
of
every
footstep
on
the
platform
in
unreasonable
terror
till
the
end
then
at
last
i
sat
back
and
lit
a
cigarette
and
the
lights
of
waterloo
reeled
out
behind
some
men
were
returning
from
the
theatre
i
can
recall
their
conversation
even
now
they
were
disappointed
with
the
piece
they
had
seen
it
was
one
of
the
later
savoy
operas
and
they
spoke
wistfully
of
the
days
of
pinafore
and
patience
one
of
them
hummed
a
stave
and
there
was
an
argument
as
to
whether
the
air
was
out
of
patience
or
the
mikado
they
all
got
out
at
surbiton
and
i
was
alone
with
my
triumph
for
a
few
intoxicating
minutes
to
think
that
i
had
succeeded
where
raffles
had
failed
of
all
our
adventures
this
was
the
first
in
which
i
had
played
a
commanding
part
and
of
them
all
this
was
infinitely
the
least
discreditable
it
left
me
without
a
conscientious
qualm
i
had
but
robbed
a
robber
when
all
was
said
and
i
had
done
it
myself
ipse
egomet
i
pictured
raffles
his
surprise
his
delight
he
would
think
a
little
more
of
me
in
future
and
that
future
it
should
be
different
we
had
two
thousand
pounds
apiece
surely
enough
to
start
afresh
as
honest
men
and
all
through
me
in
a
glow
i
sprang
out
at
esher
and
took
the
one
belated
cab
that
was
waiting
under
the
bridge
in
a
perfect
fever
i
beheld
broom
hall
with
the
lower
story
still
lit
up
and
saw
the
front
door
open
as
i
climbed
the
steps
thought
it
was
you
said
raffles
cheerily
it
all
right
a
bed
for
you
sir
bernard
sitting
up
to
shake
your
hand
his
good
spirits
disappointed
me
but
i
knew
the
man
he
was
one
of
those
who
wear
their
brightest
smile
in
the
blackest
hour
i
knew
him
too
well
by
this
time
to
be
deceived
i
got
it
i
cried
in
his
ear
i
got
it
got
what
he
asked
me
stepping
back
the
picture
what
the
picture
he
showed
it
me
you
had
to
go
without
it
i
saw
that
so
i
determined
to
have
it
and
here
it
is
let
see
said
raffles
grimly
i
threw
off
my
cape
and
unwound
the
canvas
from
about
my
body
while
i
was
doing
so
an
untidy
old
gentleman
made
his
appearance
in
the
hall
and
stood
looking
on
with
raised
eyebrows
looks
pretty
fresh
for
an
old
master
does
she
said
raffles
his
tone
was
strange
i
could
only
suppose
that
he
was
jealous
of
my
success
so
craggs
said
i
hardly
looked
at
it
myself
well
look
now
look
closely
by
jove
i
must
have
faked
her
better
than
i
thought
it
a
copy
i
cried
it
the
copy
he
answered
it
the
copy
i
been
tearing
all
over
the
country
to
procure
it
the
copy
i
faked
back
and
front
so
that
on
your
own
showing
it
imposed
upon
craggs
and
might
have
made
him
happy
for
life
and
you
go
and
rob
him
of
that
i
could
not
speak
how
did
you
manage
it
inquired
sir
bernard
debenham
have
you
killed
him
asked
raffles
sardonically
i
did
not
look
at
him
i
turned
to
sir
bernard
debenham
and
to
him
i
told
my
story
hoarsely
excitedly
for
it
was
all
that
i
could
do
to
keep
from
breaking
down
but
as
i
spoke
i
became
calmer
and
i
finished
in
mere
bitterness
with
the
remark
that
another
time
raffles
might
tell
me
what
he
meant
to
do
another
time
he
cried
instantly
my
dear
bunny
you
speak
as
though
we
were
going
to
turn
burglars
for
a
living
i
trust
you
wo
said
sir
bernard
smiling
for
you
are
certainly
two
very
daring
young
men
let
us
hope
our
friend
from
queensland
will
do
as
he
said
and
not
open
his
till
he
gets
back
there
he
will
find
my
check
awaiting
him
and
i
shall
be
very
much
surprised
if
he
troubles
any
of
us
again
raffles
and
i
did
not
speak
till
i
was
in
the
room
which
had
been
prepared
for
me
nor
was
i
anxious
to
do
so
then
but
he
followed
me
and
took
my
hand
bunny
said
he
do
you
be
hard
on
a
fellow
i
was
in
the
deuce
of
a
hurry
and
did
know
that
i
should
ever
get
what
i
wanted
in
time
and
that
a
fact
but
it
serves
me
right
that
you
should
have
gone
and
undone
one
of
the
best
things
i
ever
did
as
for
your
handiwork
old
chap
you
wo
mind
my
saying
that
i
did
think
you
had
it
in
you
in
future
do
talk
to
me
about
the
future
i
cried
i
hate
the
whole
thing
i
going
to
chuck
it
up
so
am
i
said
raffles
when
i
made
my
pile
the
return
match
i
had
turned
into
piccadilly
one
thick
evening
in
the
following
november
when
my
guilty
heart
stood
still
at
the
sudden
grip
of
a
hand
upon
my
arm
i
thought
i
was
always
thinking
that
my
inevitable
hour
was
come
at
last
it
was
only
raffles
however
who
stood
smiling
at
me
through
the
fog
well
met
said
he
i
been
looking
for
you
at
the
club
i
was
just
on
my
way
there
i
returned
with
an
attempt
to
hide
my
tremors
it
was
an
ineffectual
attempt
as
i
saw
from
his
broader
smile
and
by
the
indulgent
shake
of
his
head
come
up
to
my
place
instead
said
he
i
something
amusing
to
tell
you
i
made
excuses
for
his
tone
foretold
the
kind
of
amusement
and
it
was
a
kind
against
which
i
had
successfully
set
my
face
for
months
i
have
stated
before
however
and
i
can
but
reiterate
that
to
me
at
all
events
there
was
never
anybody
in
the
world
so
irresistible
as
raffles
when
his
mind
was
made
up
that
we
had
both
been
independent
of
crime
since
our
little
service
to
sir
bernard
debenham
that
there
had
been
no
occasion
for
that
masterful
mind
to
be
made
up
in
any
such
direction
for
many
a
day
was
the
undeniable
basis
of
a
longer
spell
of
honesty
than
i
had
hitherto
enjoyed
during
the
term
of
our
mutual
intimacy
be
sure
i
would
deny
it
if
i
could
the
very
thing
i
am
to
tell
you
would
discredit
such
a
boast
i
made
my
excuses
as
i
have
said
but
his
arm
slid
through
mine
with
his
little
laugh
of
mastery
and
even
while
i
argued
we
were
on
his
staircase
in
the
albany
his
fire
had
fallen
low
he
poked
and
replenished
it
after
lighting
the
gas
as
for
me
i
stood
by
sullenly
in
my
overcoat
until
he
dragged
it
off
my
back
what
a
chap
you
are
said
raffles
playfully
one
would
really
think
i
had
proposed
to
crack
another
crib
this
blessed
night
well
it
is
that
bunny
so
get
into
that
chair
and
take
one
of
these
sullivans
and
sit
tight
he
held
the
match
to
my
cigarette
he
brought
me
a
whiskey
and
soda
then
he
went
out
into
the
lobby
and
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
feel
happy
i
heard
a
bolt
shot
home
it
cost
me
an
effort
to
remain
in
that
chair
next
moment
he
was
straddling
another
and
gloating
over
my
discomfiture
across
his
folded
arms
you
remember
milchester
bunny
old
boy
his
tone
was
as
bland
as
mine
was
grim
when
i
answered
that
i
did
we
had
a
little
match
there
that
was
down
on
the
card
gentlemen
and
players
if
you
recollect
i
do
forget
it
seeing
that
you
never
got
an
innings
so
to
speak
i
thought
you
might
well
the
gentlemen
scored
pretty
freely
but
the
players
were
all
caught
poor
devils
do
be
too
sure
you
remember
the
fellow
we
saw
in
the
inn
the
florid
chap
who
i
told
you
was
one
of
the
cleverest
thieves
in
town
i
remember
him
crawshay
his
name
turned
out
to
be
well
it
was
certainly
the
name
he
was
convicted
under
so
crawshay
let
it
be
you
need
waste
any
pity
on
him
old
chap
he
escaped
from
dartmoor
yesterday
afternoon
well
done
raffles
smiled
but
his
eyebrows
had
gone
up
and
his
shoulders
followed
suit
you
are
perfectly
right
it
was
very
well
done
indeed
i
wonder
you
did
see
it
in
the
paper
in
a
dense
fog
on
the
moor
yesterday
good
old
crawshay
made
a
bolt
for
it
and
got
away
without
a
scratch
under
heavy
fire
all
honor
to
him
i
agree
a
fellow
with
that
much
grit
deserves
his
liberty
but
crawshay
has
a
good
deal
more
they
hunted
him
all
night
long
could
find
him
for
nuts
and
that
was
all
you
missed
in
the
morning
papers
he
unfolded
a
pall
mall
which
he
had
brought
in
with
him
but
listen
to
this
here
an
account
of
the
escape
with
just
the
addition
which
puts
the
thing
on
a
higher
level
fugitive
has
been
traced
to
totnes
where
he
appears
to
have
committed
a
peculiarly
daring
outrage
in
the
early
hours
of
this
morning
he
is
reported
to
have
entered
the
lodgings
of
the
rev
ellingworth
curate
of
the
parish
who
missed
his
clothes
on
rising
at
the
usual
hour
later
in
the
morning
those
of
the
convict
were
discovered
neatly
folded
at
the
bottom
of
a
drawer
meanwhile
crawshay
had
made
good
his
second
escape
though
it
is
believed
that
so
distinctive
a
guise
will
lead
to
his
recapture
during
the
day
what
do
you
think
of
that
bunny
he
is
certainly
a
sportsman
said
i
reaching
for
the
paper
he
more
said
raffles
he
an
artist
and
i
envy
him
the
curate
of
all
men
beautiful
beautiful
but
that
not
all
i
saw
just
now
on
the
board
at
the
club
that
there
been
an
outrage
on
the
line
near
dawlish
parson
found
insensible
in
the
way
our
friend
again
the
telegram
does
say
so
but
it
obvious
simply
knocked
some
other
fellow
out
changed
clothes
again
and
come
on
gayly
to
town
is
it
great
i
do
believe
it
the
best
thing
of
the
kind
that
ever
been
done
but
why
should
he
come
to
town
in
an
instant
the
enthusiasm
faded
from
raffles
face
clearly
i
had
reminded
him
of
some
prime
anxiety
forgotten
in
his
impersonal
joy
over
the
exploit
of
a
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
towards
the
lobby
before
replying
i
believe
said
he
that
the
beggar
on
my
tracks
and
as
he
spoke
he
was
himself
again
quietly
amused
cynically
unperturbed
characteristically
enjoying
the
situation
and
my
surprise
but
look
here
what
do
you
mean
said
i
what
does
crawshay
know
about
you
not
much
but
he
suspects
why
should
he
because
in
his
way
he
very
nearly
as
good
a
man
as
i
am
because
my
dear
bunny
with
eyes
in
his
head
and
brains
behind
them
he
could
help
suspecting
he
saw
me
once
in
town
with
old
baird
he
must
have
seen
me
that
day
in
the
pub
on
the
way
to
milchester
as
well
as
afterwards
on
the
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
know
he
did
for
he
wrote
and
told
me
so
before
his
trial
he
wrote
to
you
and
you
never
told
me
the
old
shrug
answered
the
old
grievance
what
was
the
good
my
dear
fellow
it
would
only
have
worried
you
well
what
did
he
say
that
he
was
sorry
he
had
been
run
in
before
getting
back
to
town
as
he
had
proposed
doing
himself
the
honor
of
paying
me
a
call
however
he
trusted
it
was
only
a
pleasure
deferred
and
he
begged
me
not
to
go
and
get
lagged
myself
before
he
came
out
of
course
he
knew
the
melrose
necklace
was
gone
though
he
had
got
it
and
he
said
that
the
man
who
could
take
that
and
leave
the
rest
was
a
man
after
his
own
heart
and
so
on
with
certain
little
proposals
for
the
far
future
which
i
fear
may
be
the
very
near
future
indeed
i
only
surprised
he
has
turned
up
yet
he
looked
again
towards
the
lobby
which
he
had
left
in
darkness
with
the
inner
door
shut
as
carefully
as
the
outer
one
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
to
do
let
him
knock
if
he
gets
so
far
the
porter
is
to
say
i
out
of
town
it
will
be
true
too
in
another
hour
or
so
you
going
off
by
the
from
liverpool
street
i
do
say
much
about
my
people
bunny
but
i
have
the
best
of
sisters
married
to
a
country
parson
in
the
eastern
counties
they
always
make
me
welcome
and
let
me
read
the
lessons
for
the
sake
of
getting
me
to
church
i
sorry
you
wo
be
there
to
hear
me
on
sunday
bunny
i
figured
out
some
of
my
best
schemes
in
that
parish
and
i
know
of
no
better
port
in
a
storm
but
i
must
pack
i
thought
i
just
let
you
know
where
i
was
going
and
why
in
case
you
cared
to
follow
my
example
he
flung
the
stump
of
his
cigarette
into
the
fire
stretched
himself
as
he
rose
and
remained
so
long
in
the
inelegant
attitude
that
my
eyes
mounted
from
his
body
to
his
face
a
second
later
they
had
followed
his
eyes
across
the
room
and
i
also
was
on
my
legs
on
the
threshold
of
the
folding
doors
that
divided
bedroom
and
a
man
stood
in
broadcloth
and
bowed
to
us
until
his
bullet
head
presented
an
unbroken
disk
of
short
red
hair
brief
as
was
my
survey
of
this
astounding
apparition
the
interval
was
long
enough
for
raffles
to
recover
his
composure
his
hands
were
in
his
pockets
and
a
smile
upon
his
face
when
my
eyes
flew
back
to
him
let
me
introduce
you
bunny
said
he
to
our
distinguished
colleague
reginald
crawshay
the
bullet
head
bobbed
up
and
there
was
a
wrinkled
brow
above
the
coarse
shaven
face
crimson
also
i
remember
from
the
grip
of
a
collar
several
sizes
too
small
but
i
noted
nothing
consciously
at
the
time
i
had
jumped
to
my
own
conclusion
and
i
turned
on
raffles
with
an
oath
it
a
trick
i
cried
it
another
of
your
cursed
tricks
you
got
him
here
and
then
you
got
me
you
want
me
to
join
you
i
suppose
i
see
you
damned
so
cold
was
the
stare
which
met
this
outburst
that
i
became
ashamed
of
my
words
while
they
were
yet
upon
my
lips
really
bunny
said
raffles
and
turned
his
shoulder
with
a
shrug
lord
love
yer
cried
crawshay
knew
nothin
expect
me
all
right
and
you
the
cool
canary
you
are
he
went
on
to
raffles
i
knoo
you
were
but
do
me
proud
you
one
after
my
own
kidney
and
he
thrust
out
a
shaggy
hand
after
that
said
raffles
taking
it
what
am
i
to
say
but
you
must
have
heard
my
opinion
of
you
i
am
proud
to
make
your
acquaintance
how
the
deuce
did
you
get
in
never
you
mind
said
crawshay
loosening
his
collar
let
talk
about
how
i
to
get
out
lord
love
yer
but
that
better
there
was
a
livid
ring
round
his
that
he
fingered
tenderly
did
know
how
much
longer
i
might
have
to
play
the
gent
he
explained
did
know
who
you
bring
in
drink
whiskey
and
soda
inquired
raffles
when
the
convict
was
in
the
chair
from
which
i
had
leapt
no
i
drink
it
neat
replied
crawshay
but
i
talk
business
first
you
do
get
over
me
like
that
lor
love
yer
well
then
what
can
i
do
for

brother
through

it
at
that
you
see
me
through
in
yer
own
way
i
leaves
it
all
to
you
his
tone
was
rich
with
conciliation
and
concession
he
bent
over
and
tore
a
pair
of
button
boots
from
his
bare
feet
which
he
stretched
towards
the
fire
painfully
uncurling
his
toes
i
hope
you
take
a
larger
size
than
them
said
he
i
have
had
a
see

well
said
raffles
we
must
see
what
can
be
done
we
must
said
crawshay
and
leaned
back
comfortably
and
began
twirling
his
stubby
thumbs
raffles
turned
to
me
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
but
his
forehead
was
scored
with
thought
and
resolve
mingled
with
resignation
in
the
lines
of
his
mouth
and
he
spoke
exactly
as
though
he
and
i
were
alone
in
the
room
you
seize
the
situation
bunny
if
our
friend
here
is
to
speak
his
language
he
means
to
the
gaff
on
you
and
me
he
is
considerate
enough
not
to
say
so
in
so
many
words
but
it
plain
enough
and
natural
enough
for
that
matter
i
would
do
the
same
in
his
place
we
had
the
bulge
before
he
has
it
now
it
perfectly
fair
we
must
take
on
this
job
we
are
in
a
position
to
refuse
it
even
if
we
were
i
should
take
it
on
our
friend
is
a
great
sportsman
he
has
got
clear
away
from
dartmoor
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
to
let
him
go
back
nor
shall
he
not
if
i
can
think
of
a
way
of
getting
him
abroad
any
way
you
like
murmured
crawshay
with
his
eyes
shut
i
leaves
the
thing
to
you
but
you
have
to
wake
up
and
tell
us
things
all
right
mister
but
i
fair
on
the
rocks
for
a
sleep
and
he
stood
up
blinking
think
you
were
traced
to
town
must
have
been
and
here
not
in
this
fog
not
with
any
luck
raffles
went
into
the
bedroom
lit
the
gas
there
and
returned
next
minute
so
you
got
in
by
the
window
that
about
it
it
was
devilish
smart
of
you
to
know
which
one
it
beats
me
how
you
brought
it
off
in
daylight
fog
or
no
fog
but
let
that
pass
you
do
think
you
were
seen
i
do
think
it
sir
well
let
hope
you
are
right
i
shall
reconnoitre
and
soon
find
out
and
you
better
come
too
bunny
and
have
something
to
eat
and
talk
it
over
as
raffles
looked
at
me
i
looked
at
crawshay
anticipating
trouble
and
trouble
brewed
in
his
blank
fierce
face
in
the
glitter
of
his
startled
eyes
in
the
sudden
closing
of
his
fists
and
what
to
become
o
me
he
cried
out
with
an
oath
you
wait
here
no
you
do
he
roared
and
at
a
bound
had
his
back
to
the
door
you
do
get
round
me
like
that
you
cuckoos
raffles
turned
to
me
with
a
twitch
of
the
shoulders
that
the
worst
of
these
professors
said
he
they
never
will
use
their
heads
they
see
the
pegs
and
they
mean
to
hit
but
that
all
they
do
see
and
mean
and
they
think
we
the
same
no
wonder
we
licked
them
last
time
do
talk
through
yer
neck
snarled
the
convict
talk
out
straight
curse
you
right
said
raffles
i
talk
as
straight
as
you
like
you
say
you
put
yourself
in
my
hands
you
leave
it
all
to
me
yet
you
trust
me
an
inch
i
know
what
to
happen
if
i
fail
i
accept
the
risk
i
take
this
thing
on
yet
you
think
i
going
straight
out
to
give
you
away
and
make
you
give
me
away
in
my
turn
you
a
fool
crawshay
though
you
have
broken
dartmoor
you
got
to
listen
to
a
better
man
and
obey
him
i
see
you
through
in
my
own
way
or
not
at
all
i
come
and
go
as
i
like
and
with
whom
i
like
without
your
interference
you
stay
here
and
lie
just
as
low
as
you
know
how
be
as
wise
as
your
word
and
leave
the
whole
thing
to
me
if
you
wo
if
you
fool
enough
not
to
trust
me
there
the
door
go
out
and

what
you

and
be
damned
to
you
crawshay
slapped
his
thigh
that
talking
said
he
lord
love
yer
i
know
where
i
am
when
you
talk
like
that
i
trust
yer
i
know
a
man
when
he
gets
his
tongue
between
his
teeth
you
all
right
i
do
say
so
much
about
this
other
gent
though
i
saw
him
along
with
you
on
the
job
that
time
in
the
provinces
but
if
he
a
pal
of
yours
raffles

all
right
too
i
only
hope
you
gents
ai
too
stony
and
he
touched
his
pockets
with
a
rueful
face
i
only
went
for
their
togs
said
he
you
never
struck
two
such
cusses
in
yer
life
that
all
right
said
raffles
we
see
you
through
properly
leave
it
to
us
and
you
sit
tight
rightum
said
crawshay
and
i
have
a
sleep
time
you
gone
but
no
sperrits
no
not
yet
once
let
me
loose
on
the
lush
and
lord
love
yer
i
a
gone
coon
raffles
got
his
overcoat
a
long
light
i
remember
and
even
as
he
put
it
on
our
fugitive
was
dozing
in
the
chair
we
left
him
murmuring
incoherently
with
the
gas
out
and
his
bare
feet
toasting
not
such
a
bad
chap
that
professor
said
raffles
on
the
stairs
a
real
genius
in
his
way
too
though
his
methods
are
a
little
elementary
for
my
taste
but
technique
is
everything
to
get
out
of
dartmoor
and
into
the
albany
in
the
same
hours
is
a
whole
that
justifies
its
parts
good
lord
we
had
passed
a
man
in
the
foggy
courtyard
and
raffles
had
nipped
my
arm
who
was
it
the
last
man
we
want
to
see
i
hope
to
heaven
he
did
hear
me
but
who
is
he
raffles
our
old
friend
mackenzie
from
the
yard
i
stood
still
with
horror
do
you
think
he
on
crawshay
track
i
do
know
i
find
out
and
before
i
could
remonstrate
he
had
wheeled
me
round
when
i
found
my
voice
he
merely
laughed
and
whispered
that
the
bold
course
was
the
safe
one
every
time
but
it
madness
not
it
shut
up
is
that
you
mr
mackenzie
the
detective
turned
about
and
scrutinized
us
keenly
and
through
the
gaslit
mist
i
noticed
that
his
hair
was
grizzled
at
the
temples
and
his
face
still
cadaverous
from
the
wound
that
had
nearly
been
his
death
ye
have
the
advantage
o
me
sirs
said
he
i
hope
you
fit
again
said
my
companion
my
name
is
raffles
and
we
met
at
milchester
last
year
is
that
a
fact
cried
the
scotchman
with
quite
a
start
yes
now
i
remember
your
face
and
yours
too
sir
ay
yon
was
a
bad
business
but
it
ended
vera
well
an
that
the
main
thing
his
native
caution
had
returned
to
him
raffles
pinched
my
arm
yes
it
ended
splendidly
but
for
you
said
he
but
what
about
this
escape
of
the
leader
of
the
gang
that
fellow
crawshay
what
do
you
think
of
that
eh
i
havena
the
parteeculars
replied
the
scot
good
cried
raffles
i
was
only
afraid
you
might
be
on
his
tracks
once
more
mackenzie
shook
his
head
with
a
dry
smile
and
wished
us
good
evening
as
an
invisible
window
was
thrown
up
and
a
whistle
blown
softly
through
the
fog
we
must
see
this
out
whispered
raffles
nothing
more
natural
than
a
little
curiosity
on
our
part
after
him
quick
and
we
followed
the
detective
into
another
entrance
on
the
same
side
as
that
from
which
we
had
emerged
the
side
on
one
way
to
piccadilly
quite
openly
we
followed
him
and
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
met
one
of
the
porters
of
the
place
raffles
asked
him
what
was
wrong
nothing
sir
said
the
fellow
glibly
rot
said
raffles
that
was
mackenzie
the
detective
i
just
been
speaking
to
him
what
he
here
for
come
on
my
good
fellow
we
wo
give
you
away
if
you
instructions
not
to
tell
the
man
looked
quaintly
wistful
the
temptation
of
an
audience
hot
upon
him
a
door
shut
upstairs
and
he
fell
it
like
this
he
whispered
this
afternoon
a
comes
arfter
rooms
and
i
sent
him
to
the
orfice
one
of
the
clurks
goes
round
with
an
shows
the
empties
an
the
struck
on
the
set
the
coppers
is
up
in
now
so
he
sends
the
clurk
to
fetch
the
manager
as
there
was
one
or
two
things
he
wished
to
speak
about
an
when
they
come
back
blowed
if
the
gent
is
gone
beg
yer
pardon
sir
but
he
clean
disappeared
off
the
face
o
the
premises
and
the
porter
looked
at
us
with
shining
eyes
well
said
raffles
well
sir
they
looked
about
an
looked
about
an
at
larst
they
give
him
up
for
a
bad
job
thought
he
changed
his
mind
an
did
want
to
tip
the
clurk
so
they
shut
up
the
place
an
come
away
an
that
all
till
about
an
hour
ago
when
i
takes
the
manager
his
star
in
about
ten
minutes
he
comes
running
out
with
a
note
an
sends
me
with
it
to
scotland
yard
in
a
hansom
an
that
all
i
know
sir
straight
the
coppers
is
up
there
now
and
the
tec
and
the
manager
and
they
think
their
gent
is
about
the
place
somewhere
still
least
i
reckon
that
their
idea
but
who
he
is
or
what
they
want
him
for
i
dunno
jolly
interesting
said
raffles
i
going
up
to
inquire
come
on
bunny
there
should
be
some
fun
beg
yer
pardon
raffles
but
you
wo
say
nothing
about
me
not
i
you
a
good
fellow
i
wo
forget
it
if
this
leads
to
sport
sport
he
whispered
as
we
reached
the
landing
it
looks
like
precious
poor
sport
for
you
and
me
bunny
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
do
know
there
no
time
to
think
this
to
start
with
and
he
thundered
on
the
shut
door
a
policeman
opened
it
raffles
strode
past
him
with
the
air
of
a
chief
commissioner
and
i
followed
before
the
man
had
recovered
from
his
astonishment
the
bare
boards
rang
under
us
in
the
bedroom
we
found
a
knot
of
officers
stooping
over
the
with
a
constable
lantern
mackenzie
was
the
first
to
stand
upright
and
he
greeted
us
with
a
glare
may
i
ask
what
you
gentlemen
want
said
he
we
want
to
lend
a
hand
said
raffles
briskly
we
lent
one
once
before
and
it
was
my
friend
here
who
took
over
from
you
the
fellow
who
split
on
all
the
rest
and
held
him
tightly
surely
that
entitles
him
at
all
events
to
see
any
fun
that
going
as
for
myself
well
true
i
only
helped
to
carry
you
to
the
house
but
for
old
acquaintance
i
do
hope
my
dear
mackenzie
that
you
will
permit
us
to
share
such
sport
as
there
may
be
i
myself
can
only
stop
a
few
minutes
in
any
case
then
ye
not
see
much
growled
the
detective
for
he
not
up
here
constable
go
you
and
stand
at
the
foot
o
the
stairs
and
let
no
other
body
come
up
on
any
conseederation
these
gentlemen
may
be
able
to
help
us
after
all
that
kind
of
you
mackenzie
cried
raffles
warmly
but
what
is
it
all
i
questioned
a
porter
i
met
coming
down
but
could
get
nothing
out
of
him
except
that
somebody
had
been
to
see
these
rooms
and
not
since
been
seen
himself
he
a
man
we
want
said
mackenzie
he
concealed
himself
somewhere
about
these
premises
or
i
vera
much
mistaken
d
reside
in
the
albany
mr
raffles
i
do
will
your
rooms
be
near
these
on
the
next
staircase
but
one
ye
just
have
left
them
just
been
in
all
the
afternoon
likely
not
all
then
i
may
have
to
search
your
rooms
sir
i
am
prepared
to
search
every
room
in
the
albany
our
man
seems
to
have
gone
for
the
leads
but
unless
he
left
more
marks
outside
than
in
or
we
find
him
up
there
i
shall
have
the
entire
building
to
ransack
i
will
leave
you
my
key
said
raffles
at
once
i
am
dining
out
but
i
leave
it
with
the
officer
down
below
i
caught
my
breath
in
mute
amazement
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
insane
promise
it
was
wilful
gratuitous
suicidal
it
made
me
catch
at
his
sleeve
in
open
horror
and
disgust
but
with
a
word
of
thanks
mackenzie
had
returned
to
his
and
we
sauntered
unwatched
through
the
into
the
adjoining
room
here
the
window
looked
down
into
the
courtyard
it
was
still
open
and
as
we
gazed
out
in
apparent
idleness
raffles
reassured
me
it
all
right
bunny
you
do
what
i
tell
you
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
it
a
tight
corner
but
i
do
despair
what
you
got
to
do
is
to
stick
to
these
chaps
especially
if
they
search
my
rooms
they
must
poke
about
more
than
necessary
and
they
wo
if
you
there
but
where
will
you
be
you
never
going
to
leave
me
to
be
landed
alone
if
i
do
it
will
be
to
turn
up
trumps
at
the
right
moment
besides
there
are
such
things
as
windows
and
crawshay
the
man
to
take
his
risks
you
must
trust
me
bunny
you
known
me
long
enough
are
you
going
now
there
no
time
to
lose
stick
to
them
old
chap
do
let
them
suspect
you
whatever
else
you
do
his
hand
lay
an
instant
on
my
shoulder
then
he
left
me
at
the
window
and
recrossed
the
room
i
got
to
go
now
i
heard
him
say
but
my
friend
will
stay
and
see
this
through
and
i
leave
the
gas
on
in
my
rooms
and
my
key
with
the
constable
downstairs
good
luck
mackenzie
only
wish
i
could
stay
sir
came
in
a
preoccupied
voice
and
many
thanks
mackenzie
was
still
busy
at
his
window
and
i
remained
at
mine
a
prey
to
mingled
fear
and
wrath
for
all
my
knowledge
of
raffles
and
of
his
infinite
resource
by
this
time
i
felt
that
i
knew
more
or
less
what
he
would
do
in
any
given
emergency
at
least
i
could
conjecture
a
characteristic
course
of
equal
cunning
and
audacity
he
would
return
to
his
rooms
put
crawshay
on
his
guard
and
stow
him
away
no
there
were
such
things
as
windows
then
why
was
raffles
going
to
desert
us
all
i
thought
of
many
things
lastly
of
a
cab
these
bedroom
windows
looked
into
a
narrow
they
were
not
very
high
from
them
a
man
might
drop
on
to
the
roof
of
a
cab
even
as
it
passed
and
be
driven
away
even
under
the
noses
of
the
police
i
pictured
raffles
driving
that
cab
unrecognizable
in
the
foggy
night
the
vision
came
to
me
as
he
passed
under
the
window
tucking
up
the
collar
of
his
great
on
the
way
to
his
rooms
it
was
still
with
me
when
he
passed
again
on
his
way
back
and
stopped
to
hand
the
constable
his
key
we
on
his
track
said
a
voice
behind
me
he
got
up
on
the
leads
sure
enough
though
how
he
managed
it
from
yon
window
is
a
to
me
we
going
to
lock
up
here
and
try
what
like
it
is
from
the
attics
so
you
better
come
with
us
if
you
a
mind
the
top
floor
at
the
albany
as
elsewhere
is
devoted
to
the
servants
a
congeries
of
little
kitchens
and
cubicles
used
by
many
as
by
raffles
among
the
many
the
annex
in
this
case
was
of
course
empty
as
the
rooms
below
and
that
was
lucky
for
we
filled
it
what
with
the
manager
who
now
joined
us
and
another
tenant
whom
he
brought
with
him
to
mackenzie
undisguised
annoyance
better
let
in
all
piccadilly
at
a
crown
a
head
said
he
here
my
man
out
you
go
on
the
roof
to
make
one
less
and
have
your
truncheon
handy
we
crowded
to
the
little
window
which
mackenzie
took
care
to
fill
and
a
minute
yielded
no
sound
but
the
crunch
and
slither
of
constabulary
boots
upon
sooty
slates
then
came
a
shout
what
now
cried
mackenzie
a
rope
we
heard
hanging
from
the
spout
by
a
hook
sirs
purred
mackenzie
yon
how
he
got
up
from
below
he
would
do
it
with
one
o
they
telescope
sticks
an
i
never
thocht
how
long
a
rope
my
lad
quite
short
i
got
it
did
it
hang
over
a
window
ask
him
that
cried
the
manager
he
can
see
by
leaning
over
the
parapet
the
question
was
repeated
by
mackenzie
a
pause
then
yes
it
did
ask
him
how
many
windows
along
shouted
the
manager
in
high
excitement
six
he
says
said
mackenzie
next
minute
and
he
drew
in
his
head
and
shoulders
i
should
just
like
to
see
those
rooms
six
windows
along
raffles
announced
the
manager
after
a
mental
calculation
is
that
a
fact
cried
mackenzie
then
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
at
all
he
left
me
his
key
down
below
the
words
had
a
dry
speculative
intonation
which
even
then
i
found
time
to
dislike
it
was
as
though
the
coincidence
had
already
struck
the
scotchman
as
something
more
where
is
mr
raffles
asked
the
manager
as
we
all
filed
downstairs
he
gone
out
to
his
dinner
said
mackenzie
are
you
sure
i
saw
him
go
said
i
my
heart
was
beating
horribly
i
would
not
trust
myself
to
speak
again
but
i
wormed
my
way
to
a
front
place
in
the
little
procession
and
was
in
fact
the
second
man
to
cross
the
threshold
that
had
been
the
rubicon
of
my
life
as
i
did
so
i
uttered
a
cry
of
pain
for
mackenzie
had
trod
back
heavily
on
my
toes
in
another
second
i
saw
the
reason
and
saw
it
with
another
and
a
louder
cry
a
man
was
lying
at
full
length
before
the
fire
on
his
back
with
a
little
wound
in
the
white
forehead
and
the
blood
draining
into
his
eyes
and
the
man
was
raffles
himself
suicide
said
mackenzie
calmly
no
here
the
poker
looks
more
like
murder
he
went
on
his
knees
and
shook
his
head
quite
cheerfully
an
it
not
even
murder
said
he
with
a
shade
of
disgust
in
his
voice
yon
no
more
than
a
and
i
have
my
doubts
whether
it
felled
him
but
sirs
he
just
stinks
o
chloryform
he
got
up
and
fixed
his
keen
gray
eyes
upon
me
my
own
were
full
of
tears
but
they
faced
him
unashamed
i
understood
ye
to
say
ye
saw
him
go
out
said
he
sternly
i
saw
that
long
of
course
i
thought
he
was
inside
it
and
i
could
ha
sworn
it
was
the
same
gent
when
he
give
me
the
key
it
was
the
disconsolate
voice
of
the
constable
in
the
background
on
him
turned
mackenzie
white
to
the
lips
you
think
anything
some
of
you
damned
policemen
said
he
your
number
you
rotter
p
you
be
hearing
more
of
this
p
if
that
gentleman
was
dead
instead
of
coming
to
himself
while
talking
do
you
know
what
you
be
guilty
of
his
manslaughter
you
stuck
pig
in
buttons
do
you
know
who
you
let
slip
crawshay
no
less
him
that
broke
dartmoor
yesterday
by
the
god
that
made
ye
p
if
i
lose
him
i
hound
ye
from
the
forrce
working
face
shaking
fist
a
calm
man
on
fire
it
was
a
new
side
of
mackenzie
and
one
to
mark
and
to
digest
next
moment
he
had
flounced
from
our
midst
difficult
thing
to
break
your
own
head
said
raffles
later
infinitely
easier
to
cut
your
own
throat
chloroform
another
matter
when
you
used
it
on
others
you
know
the
dose
to
a
nicety
so
you
thought
i
was
really
gone
poor
old
bunny
but
i
hope
mackenzie
saw
your
face
he
did
said
i
would
not
tell
him
all
mackenzie
must
have
seen
however
that
all
right
i
would
have
had
him
miss
it
for
worlds
and
you
must
think
me
a
brute
old
boy
for
i
fear
that
man
and
know
we
sink
or
swim
together
and
now
we
sink
or
swim
with
crawshay
too
said
i
dolefully
not
we
said
raffles
with
conviction
old
crawshay
a
true
sportsman
and
he
do
by
us
as
we
done
by
him
besides
this
makes
us
quits
and
i
do
think
bunny
that
we
take
on
the
professors
again
the
gift
of
the
emperor
i
when
the
king
of
the
cannibal
islands
made
faces
at
queen
victoria
and
a
european
monarch
set
the
cables
tingling
with
his
compliments
on
the
exploit
the
indignation
in
england
was
not
less
than
the
surprise
for
the
thing
was
not
so
common
as
it
has
since
become
but
when
it
transpired
that
a
gift
of
peculiar
significance
was
to
follow
the
congratulations
to
give
them
weight
the
inference
prevailed
that
the
white
potentate
and
the
black
had
taken
simultaneous
leave
of
their
fourteen
senses
for
the
gift
was
a
pearl
of
price
unparalleled
picked
aforetime
by
british
cutlasses
from
a
polynesian
setting
and
presented
by
british
royalty
to
the
sovereign
who
seized
this
opportunity
of
restoring
it
to
its
original
possessor
the
incident
would
have
been
a
godsend
to
the
press
a
few
weeks
later
even
in
june
there
were
leaders
letters
large
headlines
leaded
type
the
daily
chronicle
devoting
half
its
literary
page
to
a
charming
drawing
of
the
island
capital
which
the
new
pall
mall
in
a
leading
article
headed
by
a
pun
advised
the
government
to
blow
to
flinders
i
was
myself
driving
a
poor
but
not
dishonest
quill
at
the
time
and
the
topic
of
the
hour
goaded
me
into
satiric
verse
which
obtained
a
better
place
than
anything
i
had
yet
turned
out
i
had
let
my
flat
in
town
and
taken
inexpensive
quarters
at
thames
ditton
on
the
plea
of
a
disinterested
passion
for
the
river
old
boy
said
raffles
who
must
needs
come
and
see
me
there
lying
back
in
the
boat
while
i
sculled
and
steered
i
suppose
they
pay
you
pretty
well
for
these
eh
not
a
penny
nonsense
bunny
i
thought
they
paid
so
well
give
them
time
and
you
get
your
check
oh
no
i
said
i
gloomily
i
got
to
be
content
with
the
honor
of
getting
in
the
editor
wrote
to
say
so
in
so
many
words
i
added
but
i
gave
the
gentleman
his
distinguished
name
you
do
mean
to
say
you
written
for
payment
already
no
it
was
the
last
thing
i
had
intended
to
admit
but
i
had
done
it
the
murder
was
out
there
was
no
sense
in
further
concealment
i
had
written
for
my
money
because
i
really
needed
it
if
he
must
know
i
was
cursedly
hard
up
raffles
nodded
as
though
he
knew
already
i
warmed
to
my
woes
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
keep
your
end
up
as
a
raw
freelance
of
letters
for
my
part
i
was
afraid
i
wrote
neither
well
enough
nor
ill
enough
for
success
i
suffered
from
a
persistent
ineffectual
feeling
after
style
verse
i
could
manage
but
it
did
not
pay
to
personal
paragraphs
and
the
baser
journalism
i
could
not
and
i
would
not
stoop
raffles
nodded
again
this
time
with
a
smile
that
stayed
in
his
eyes
as
he
leant
back
watching
me
i
knew
that
he
was
thinking
of
other
things
i
had
stooped
to
and
i
thought
i
knew
what
he
was
going
to
say
he
had
said
it
before
so
often
he
was
sure
to
say
it
again
i
had
my
answer
ready
but
evidently
he
was
tired
of
asking
the
same
question
his
lids
fell
he
took
up
the
paper
he
had
dropped
and
i
sculled
the
length
of
the
old
red
wall
of
hampton
court
before
he
spoke
again
and
they
gave
you
nothing
for
these
my
dear
bunny
they
capital
not
only
qua
verses
but
for
crystallizing
your
subject
and
putting
it
in
a
nutshell
certainly
you
taught
me
more
about
it
than
i
knew
before
but
is
it
really
worth
fifty
thousand
pounds
a
single
pearl
a
hundred
i
believe
but
that
would
scan
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
said
raffles
with
his
eyes
shut
and
again
i
made
certain
what
was
coming
but
again
i
was
mistaken
if
it
worth
all
that
he
cried
at
last
there
would
be
no
getting
rid
of
it
at
all
it
not
like
a
diamond
that
you
can
subdivide
but
i
beg
your
pardon
bunny
i
was
forgetting
and
we
said
no
more
about
the
emperor
gift
for
pride
thrives
on
an
empty
pocket
and
no
privation
would
have
drawn
from
me
the
proposal
which
i
had
expected
raffles
to
make
my
expectation
had
been
half
a
hope
though
i
only
knew
it
now
but
neither
did
we
touch
again
on
what
raffles
professed
to
have
forgotten
my
apostasy
my
lapse
into
virtue
as
he
had
been
pleased
to
call
it
we
were
both
a
little
silent
a
little
constrained
each
preoccupied
with
his
own
thoughts
it
was
months
since
we
had
met
and
as
i
saw
him
off
towards
eleven
that
sunday
night
i
fancied
it
was
for
more
months
that
we
were
saying
but
as
we
waited
for
the
train
i
saw
those
clear
eyes
peering
at
me
under
the
station
lamps
and
when
i
met
their
glance
raffles
shook
his
head
you
do
look
well
on
it
bunny
said
he
i
never
did
believe
in
this
thames
valley
you
want
a
change
of
air
i
wished
i
might
get
it
what
you
really
want
is
a
sea
voyage
and
a
winter
at
moritz
or
do
you
recommend
cannes
or
cairo
all
very
well
but
you
forget
what
i
told
you
about
my
funds
i
forget
nothing
i
merely
do
want
to
hurt
your
feelings
but
look
here
a
sea
voyage
you
shall
have
i
want
a
change
myself
and
you
shall
come
with
me
as
my
guest
we
spend
july
in
the
mediterranean
but
you
playing
cricket
hang
the
cricket
well
if
i
thought
you
meant
it
of
course
i
mean
it
will
you
come
like
a
shot
if
you
go
and
i
shook
his
hand
and
waved
mine
in
farewell
with
the
perfectly
conviction
that
i
should
hear
no
more
of
the
matter
it
was
a
passing
thought
no
more
no
less
i
soon
wished
it
were
more
that
week
found
me
wishing
myself
out
of
england
for
good
and
all
i
was
making
nothing
i
could
but
subsist
on
the
difference
between
the
rent
i
paid
for
my
flat
and
the
rent
at
which
i
had
sublet
it
furnished
for
the
season
and
the
season
was
near
its
end
and
creditors
awaited
me
in
town
was
it
possible
to
be
entirely
honest
i
had
run
no
bills
when
i
had
money
in
my
pocket
and
the
more
downright
dishonesty
seemed
to
me
the
less
ignoble
but
from
raffles
of
course
i
heard
nothing
more
a
week
went
by
and
half
another
week
then
late
on
the
second
wednesday
night
i
found
a
telegram
from
him
at
my
lodgings
after
seeking
him
vainly
in
town
and
dining
with
desperation
at
the
solitary
club
to
which
i
still
belonged
arrange
to
leave
waterloo
by
north
german
lloyd
special
he
wired
monday
next
will
meet
you
southampton
aboard
uhlan
with
tickets
am
writing
and
write
he
did
a
letter
enough
but
full
of
serious
solicitude
for
me
and
for
my
health
and
prospects
a
letter
almost
touching
in
the
light
of
our
past
relations
in
the
twilight
of
their
complete
rupture
he
said
that
he
had
booked
two
berths
to
naples
that
we
were
bound
for
capri
which
was
clearly
the
island
of
the
that
we
would
bask
there
together
and
for
a
while
forget
it
was
a
charming
letter
i
had
never
seen
italy
the
privilege
of
initiation
should
be
his
no
mistake
was
greater
than
to
deem
it
an
impossible
country
for
the
summer
the
bay
of
naples
was
never
so
divine
and
he
wrote
of
faery
lands
forlorn
as
though
the
poetry
sprang
unbidden
to
his
pen
to
come
back
to
earth
and
prose
i
might
think
it
unpatriotic
of
him
to
choose
a
german
boat
but
on
no
other
line
did
you
receive
such
attention
and
accommodation
for
your
money
there
was
a
hint
of
better
reasons
raffles
wrote
as
he
had
telegraphed
from
bremen
and
i
gathered
that
the
personal
use
of
some
little
influence
with
the
authorities
there
had
resulted
in
a
material
reduction
in
our
fares
imagine
my
excitement
and
delight
i
managed
to
pay
what
i
owed
at
thames
ditton
to
squeeze
a
small
editor
for
a
very
small
check
and
my
tailors
for
one
more
flannel
suit
i
remember
that
i
broke
my
last
sovereign
to
get
a
box
of
sullivan
cigarettes
for
raffles
to
smoke
on
the
voyage
but
my
heart
was
as
light
as
my
purse
on
the
monday
morning
the
fairest
morning
of
an
unfair
summer
when
the
special
whirled
me
through
the
sunshine
to
the
sea
a
tender
awaited
us
at
southampton
raffles
was
not
on
board
nor
did
i
really
look
for
him
till
we
reached
the
liner
side
and
then
i
looked
in
vain
his
face
was
not
among
the
many
that
fringed
the
rail
his
hand
was
not
of
the
few
that
waved
to
friends
i
climbed
aboard
in
a
sudden
heaviness
i
had
no
ticket
nor
the
money
to
pay
for
one
i
did
not
even
know
the
number
of
my
room
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
as
i
waylaid
a
steward
and
asked
if
a
raffles
was
on
board
thank
heaven
he
was
but
where
the
man
did
not
know
was
plainly
on
some
other
errand
and
i
must
go
but
there
was
no
sign
of
him
on
the
promenade
deck
and
none
below
in
the
saloon
the
was
empty
but
for
a
little
german
with
a
red
moustache
twisted
into
his
eyes
nor
was
raffles
in
his
own
cabin
whither
i
inquired
my
way
in
desperation
but
where
the
sight
of
his
own
name
on
the
baggage
was
certainly
a
further
reassurance
why
he
himself
kept
in
the
background
however
i
could
not
conceive
and
only
sinister
reasons
would
suggest
themselves
in
explanation
so
there
you
are
i
been
looking
for
you
all
over
the
ship
despite
the
graven
prohibition
i
had
tried
the
bridge
as
a
last
resort
and
there
indeed
was
raffles
seated
on
a
skylight
and
leaning
over
one
of
the
officers
long
chairs
in
which
reclined
a
girl
in
a
white
drill
coat
and
skirt
a
slip
of
a
girl
with
a
pale
skin
dark
hair
and
rather
remarkable
eyes
so
much
i
noted
as
he
rose
and
quickly
turned
thereupon
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
swift
grimace
which
preceded
a
start
of
astonishment
why
bunny
cried
raffles
where
have
you
sprung
from
i
stammered
something
as
he
pinched
my
hand
and
are
you
coming
in
this
ship
and
to
naples
too
well
upon
my
word
miss
werner
may
i
introduce
him
and
he
did
so
without
a
blush
describing
me
as
an
old
schoolfellow
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
months
with
wilful
circumstance
and
gratuitous
detail
that
filled
me
at
once
with
confusion
suspicion
and
revolt
i
felt
myself
blushing
for
us
both
and
i
did
not
care
my
address
utterly
deserted
me
and
i
made
no
effort
to
recover
it
to
carry
the
thing
off
all
i
would
do
was
to
mumble
such
words
as
raffles
actually
put
into
my
mouth
and
that
i
doubt
not
with
a
thoroughly
evil
grace
so
you
saw
my
name
in
the
list
of
passengers
and
came
in
search
of
me
good
old
bunny
i
say
though
i
wish
you
share
my
cabin
i
got
a
beauty
on
the
promenade
deck
but
they
would
promise
to
keep
me
by
myself
we
ought
to
see
about
it
before
they
shove
in
some
alien
in
any
case
we
shall
have
to
get
out
of
this
for
a
quartermaster
had
entered
the
wheelhouse
and
even
while
we
had
been
speaking
the
pilot
had
taken
possession
of
the
bridge
as
we
descended
the
tender
left
us
with
flying
handkerchiefs
and
shrill
and
as
we
bowed
to
miss
werner
on
the
promenade
deck
there
came
a
deep
slow
throbbing
underfoot
and
our
voyage
had
begun
it
did
not
begin
pleasantly
between
raffles
and
me
on
deck
he
had
overborne
my
stubborn
perplexity
by
dint
of
a
forced
though
forceful
joviality
in
his
cabin
the
gloves
were
off
you
idiot
he
snarled
you
given
me
away
again
how
have
i
given
you
away
i
ignored
the
separate
insult
in
his
last
word
how
i
should
have
thought
any
clod
could
see
that
i
meant
us
to
meet
by
chance
after
taking
both
tickets
yourself
they
knew
nothing
about
that
on
board
besides
i
had
decided
when
i
took
the
tickets
then
you
should
have
let
me
know
when
you
did
decide
you
lay
your
plans
and
never
say
a
word
and
expect
me
to
tumble
to
them
by
light
of
nature
how
was
i
to
know
you
had
anything
on
i
had
turned
the
tables
with
some
effect
raffles
almost
hung
his
head
the
fact
is
bunny
i
did
mean
you
to
know
you
you
grown
such
a
pious
rabbit
in
your
old
age
my
nickname
and
his
tone
went
far
to
mollify
me
other
things
went
farther
but
i
had
much
to
forgive
him
still
if
you
were
afraid
of
writing
i
pursued
it
was
your
business
to
give
me
the
tip
the
moment
i
set
foot
on
board
i
would
have
taken
it
all
right
i
am
not
so
virtuous
as
all
that
was
it
my
imagination
or
did
raffles
look
slightly
ashamed
if
so
it
was
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
all
the
years
i
knew
him
nor
can
i
swear
to
it
even
now
that
said
he
was
the
very
thing
i
meant
to
do
to
lie
in
wait
in
my
room
and
get
you
as
you
passed
but
you
were
better
engaged
say
otherwise
the
charming
miss
werner
she
is
quite
charming
most
australian
girls
are
said
i
how
did
you
know
she
was
one
he
cried
i
heard
her
speak
brute
said
raffles
laughing
she
has
no
more
twang
than
you
have
her
people
are
german
she
has
been
to
school
in
dresden
and
is
on
her
way
out
alone
money
i
inquired
confound
you
he
said
and
though
he
was
laughing
i
thought
it
was
a
point
at
which
the
subject
might
be
changed
well
i
said
it
was
for
miss
werner
you
wanted
us
to
play
strangers
was
it
you
have
some
deeper
game
than
that
eh
i
suppose
i
have
then
had
you
better
tell
me
what
it
is
raffles
treated
me
to
the
old
cautious
scrutiny
that
i
knew
so
well
the
very
familiarity
of
it
after
all
these
months
set
me
smiling
in
a
way
that
might
have
reassured
him
for
dimly
already
i
divined
his
enterprise
it
wo
send
you
off
in
the
pilot
boat
bunny
not
quite
then
you
remember
the
pearl
you
wrote
the
i
did
not
wait
for
him
to
finish
his
sentence
you
got
it
i
cried
my
face
on
fire
for
i
caught
sight
of
it
that
moment
in
the
stateroom
mirror
raffles
seemed
taken
aback
not
yet
said
he
but
i
mean
to
have
it
before
we
get
to
naples
is
it
on
board
yes
but
how
where
who
got
it
a
little
german
officer
a
with
perpendicular
mustaches
i
saw
him
in
the
that
the
chap
he
always
there
herr
captain
wilhelm
von
heumann
if
you
look
in
the
list
well
he
the
special
envoy
of
the
emperor
and
he
taking
the
pearl
out
with
him
you
found
this
out
in
bremen
no
in
berlin
from
a
newspaper
man
i
know
there
i
ashamed
to
tell
you
bunny
that
i
went
there
on
purpose
i
burst
out
laughing
you
need
be
ashamed
you
are
doing
the
very
thing
i
was
rather
hoping
you
were
going
to
propose
the
other
day
on
the
river
you
were
hoping
it
said
raffles
with
his
eyes
wide
open
indeed
it
was
his
turn
to
show
surprise
and
mine
to
be
much
more
ashamed
than
i
felt
yes
i
answered
i
was
quite
keen
on
the
idea
but
i
was
going
to
propose
it
yet
you
would
have
listened
to
me
the
other
day
certainly
i
would
and
i
told
him
so
without
reserve
not
brazenly
you
understand
not
even
now
with
the
gusto
of
a
man
who
savors
such
an
adventure
for
its
own
sake
but
doggedly
defiantly
through
my
teeth
as
one
who
had
tried
to
live
honestly
and
failed
and
while
i
was
about
it
i
told
him
much
more
eloquently
enough
i
daresay
i
gave
him
chapter
and
verse
of
my
hopeless
struggle
my
inevitable
defeat
for
hopeless
and
inevitable
they
were
to
a
man
with
my
record
even
though
that
record
was
written
only
in
one
own
soul
it
was
the
old
story
of
the
thief
trying
to
turn
honest
man
the
thing
was
against
nature
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
raffles
entirely
disagreed
with
me
he
shook
his
head
over
my
conventional
view
human
nature
was
a
board
of
checkers
why
not
reconcile
one
self
to
alternate
black
and
white
why
desire
to
be
all
one
thing
or
all
the
other
like
our
forefathers
on
the
stage
or
in
the
fiction
for
his
part
he
enjoyed
himself
on
all
squares
of
the
board
and
liked
the
light
the
better
for
the
shade
my
conclusion
he
considered
absurd
but
you
err
in
good
company
bunny
for
all
the
cheap
moralists
who
preach
the
same
twaddle
old
virgil
was
the
first
and
worst
offender
of
you
all
i
back
myself
to
climb
out
of
avernus
any
day
i
like
and
sooner
or
later
i
shall
climb
out
for
good
i
suppose
i
ca
very
well
turn
myself
into
a
limited
liability
company
but
i
could
retire
and
settle
down
and
live
blamelessly
ever
after
i
not
sure
that
it
could
be
done
on
this
pearl
alone
then
you
do
still
think
it
too
remarkable
to
sell
we
might
take
a
fishery
and
haul
it
up
with
smaller
fry
it
would
come
after
months
of
ill
luck
just
as
we
were
going
to
sell
the
schooner
by
jove
it
would
be
the
talk
of
the
pacific
well
we
got
to
get
it
first
is
this
von
a
formidable
cuss
more
so
than
he
looks
and
he
has
the
cheek
of
the
devil
as
he
spoke
a
white
drill
skirt
fluttered
past
the
open
door
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
an
upturned
moustache
beyond
but
is
he
the
chap
we
have
to
deal
with
wo
the
pearl
be
in
the
purser
keeping
raffles
stood
at
the
door
frowning
out
upon
the
solent
but
for
an
instant
he
turned
to
me
with
a
sniff
my
good
fellow
do
you
suppose
the
whole
ship
company
knows
a
gem
like
that
aboard
you
said
that
it
was
worth
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
in
berlin
they
say
it
priceless
i
doubt
if
the
skipper
himself
knows
that
von
heumann
has
it
on
him
and
he
has
must
have
then
we
have
only
him
to
deal
with
he
answered
me
without
a
word
something
white
was
fluttering
past
once
more
and
raffles
stepping
forth
made
the
promenaders
three
ii
i
do
not
ask
to
set
foot
aboard
a
finer
steamship
than
the
uhlan
of
the
norddeutscher
lloyd
to
meet
a
kindlier
gentleman
than
her
commander
or
better
fellows
than
his
officers
this
much
at
least
let
me
have
the
grace
to
admit
i
hated
the
voyage
it
was
no
fault
of
anybody
connected
with
the
ship
it
was
no
fault
of
the
weather
which
was
monotonously
ideal
not
even
in
my
own
heart
did
the
reason
reside
conscience
and
i
were
divorced
at
last
and
the
decree
made
absolute
with
my
scruples
had
fled
all
fear
and
i
was
ready
to
revel
between
bright
skies
and
sparkling
sea
with
the
detachment
of
raffles
himself
it
was
raffles
himself
who
prevented
me
but
not
raffles
alone
it
was
raffles
and
that
colonial
minx
on
her
way
home
from
school
what
he
could
see
in
her
but
that
begs
the
question
of
course
he
saw
no
more
than
i
did
but
to
annoy
me
or
perhaps
to
punish
me
for
my
long
defection
he
must
turn
his
back
on
me
and
devote
himself
to
this
chit
from
southampton
to
the
mediterranean
they
were
always
together
it
was
too
absurd
after
breakfast
they
would
begin
and
go
on
until
eleven
or
twelve
at
night
there
was
no
intervening
hour
at
which
you
might
not
hear
her
nasal
laugh
or
his
quiet
voice
talking
soft
nonsense
into
her
ear
of
course
it
was
nonsense
is
it
conceivable
that
a
man
like
raffles
with
his
knowledge
of
the
world
and
his
experience
of
women
a
side
of
his
character
upon
which
i
have
purposely
never
touched
for
it
deserves
another
volume
is
it
credible
i
ask
that
such
a
man
could
find
anything
but
nonsense
to
talk
by
the
day
together
to
a
giddy
young
schoolgirl
i
would
not
be
unfair
for
the
world
i
think
i
have
admitted
that
the
young
person
had
points
her
eyes
i
suppose
were
really
fine
and
certainly
the
shape
of
the
little
brown
face
was
charming
so
far
as
mere
contour
can
charm
i
admit
also
more
audacity
than
i
cared
about
with
enviable
health
mettle
and
vitality
i
may
not
have
occasion
to
report
any
of
this
young
lady
speeches
they
would
scarcely
bear
it
and
am
therefore
the
more
anxious
to
describe
her
without
injustice
i
confess
to
some
little
prejudice
against
her
i
resented
her
success
with
raffles
of
whom
in
consequence
i
saw
less
and
less
each
day
it
is
a
mean
thing
to
have
to
confess
but
there
must
have
been
something
not
unlike
jealousy
rankling
within
me
jealousy
there
was
in
another
quarter
crude
rampant
undignified
jealousy
captain
von
heumann
would
twirl
his
mustaches
into
twin
spires
shoot
his
white
cuffs
over
his
rings
and
stare
at
me
insolently
through
his
rimless
eyeglasses
we
ought
to
have
consoled
each
other
but
we
never
exchanged
a
syllable
the
captain
had
a
murderous
scar
across
one
of
his
cheeks
a
present
from
heidelberg
and
i
used
to
think
how
he
must
long
to
have
raffles
there
to
serve
the
same
it
was
not
as
though
von
heumann
never
had
his
innings
raffles
let
him
go
in
several
times
a
day
for
the
malicious
pleasure
of
bowling
him
out
as
he
was
getting
set
those
were
his
words
when
i
taxed
him
disingenuously
with
obnoxious
conduct
towards
a
german
on
a
german
boat
you
make
yourself
disliked
on
board
by
von
heumann
merely
but
is
that
wise
when
he
the
man
we
got
to
diddle
the
wisest
thing
i
ever
did
to
have
chummed
up
with
him
would
have
been
fatal
the
common
dodge
i
was
consoled
encouraged
almost
content
i
had
feared
raffles
was
neglecting
things
and
i
told
him
so
in
a
burst
here
we
were
near
gibraltar
and
not
a
word
since
the
solent
he
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
plenty
of
time
bunny
plenty
of
time
we
can
do
nothing
before
we
get
to
genoa
and
that
wo
be
till
sunday
night
the
voyage
is
still
young
and
so
are
we
let
make
the
most
of
things
while
we
can
it
was
after
dinner
on
the
promenade
deck
and
as
raffles
spoke
he
glanced
sharply
fore
and
aft
leaving
me
next
moment
with
a
step
full
of
purpose
i
retired
to
the
to
smoke
and
read
in
a
corner
and
to
watch
von
heumann
who
very
soon
came
to
drink
beer
and
to
sulk
in
another
few
travellers
tempt
the
red
sea
at
midsummer
the
uhlan
was
very
empty
indeed
she
had
however
but
a
limited
supply
of
cabins
on
the
promenade
deck
and
there
was
just
that
excuse
for
my
sharing
room
i
could
have
had
one
to
myself
downstairs
but
i
must
be
up
above
raffles
had
insisted
that
i
should
insist
on
the
point
so
we
were
together
i
think
without
suspicion
though
also
without
any
object
that
i
could
see
on
the
sunday
afternoon
i
was
asleep
in
my
berth
the
lower
one
when
the
curtains
were
shaken
by
raffles
who
was
in
his
on
the
settee
achilles
sulking
in
his
bunk
what
else
is
there
to
do
i
asked
him
as
i
stretched
and
yawned
i
noted
however
the
of
his
tone
and
did
my
best
to
catch
it
i
have
found
something
else
bunny
i
daresay
you
misunderstand
me
the
making
his
century
this
afternoon
i
had
other
fish
to
fry
i
swung
my
legs
over
the
side
of
my
berth
and
sat
forward
as
he
was
sitting
all
attention
the
inner
door
a
grating
was
shut
and
bolted
and
curtained
like
the
open
porthole
we
shall
be
at
genoa
before
sunset
continued
raffles
it
the
place
where
the
deed
got
to
be
done
so
you
still
mean
to
do
it
did
i
ever
say
i
did
you
have
said
so
little
either
way
advisedly
so
my
dear
bunny
why
spoil
a
pleasure
trip
by
talking
unnecessary
shop
but
now
the
time
has
come
it
must
be
done
at
genoa
or
not
at
all
on
land
no
on
board
night
would
do
but
is
better
in
case
of
mishap
if
we
were
forced
to
use
violence
we
could
get
away
by
the
earliest
train
and
nothing
be
known
till
the
ship
was
sailing
and
von
heumann
found
dead
or
drugged
not
dead
i
exclaimed
of
course
not
assented
raffles
or
there
would
be
no
need
for
us
to
bolt
but
if
we
should
have
to
bolt
tuesday
morning
is
our
time
when
this
ship
has
got
to
sail
whatever
happens
but
i
do
anticipate
any
violence
violence
is
a
confession
of
terrible
incompetence
in
all
these
years
how
many
blows
have
you
known
me
to
strike
not
one
i
believe
but
i
have
been
quite
ready
to
kill
my
man
every
time
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
i
asked
him
how
he
proposed
to
enter
von
heumann
unobserved
and
even
through
the
curtained
gloom
of
ours
his
face
lighted
up
climb
into
my
bunk
bunny
and
you
shall
see
i
did
so
but
could
see
nothing
raffles
reached
across
me
and
tapped
the
ventilator
a
sort
of
trapdoor
in
the
wall
above
his
bed
some
eighteen
inches
long
and
half
that
height
it
opened
outwards
into
the
ventilating
shaft
that
said
he
is
our
door
to
fortune
open
it
if
you
like
you
wo
see
much
because
it
does
open
far
but
loosening
a
couple
of
screws
will
set
that
all
right
the
shaft
as
you
may
see
is
more
or
less
bottomless
you
pass
under
it
whenever
you
go
to
your
bath
and
the
top
is
a
skylight
on
the
bridge
that
why
this
thing
has
to
be
done
while
we
at
genoa
because
they
keep
no
watch
on
the
bridge
in
port
the
ventilator
opposite
ours
is
von
heumann
it
again
will
only
mean
a
couple
of
screws
and
there
a
beam
to
stand
on
while
you
work
but
if
anybody
should
look
up
from
below
it
extremely
unlikely
that
anybody
will
be
astir
below
so
unlikely
that
we
can
afford
to
chance
it
no
i
ca
have
you
there
to
make
sure
the
great
point
is
that
neither
of
us
should
be
seen
from
the
time
we
turn
in
a
couple
of
ship
boys
do
on
these
decks
and
they
shall
be
our
witnesses
by
jove
it
be
the
biggest
mystery
that
ever
was
made
if
von
heumann
does
resist
resist
he
wo
get
the
chance
he
drinks
too
much
beer
to
sleep
light
and
nothing
is
so
easy
as
to
chloroform
a
heavy
sleeper
even
done
it
yourself
on
an
occasion
of
which
it
perhaps
unfair
to
remind
you
von
heumann
will
be
past
sensation
almost
as
soon
as
i
get
my
hand
through
his
ventilator
i
shall
crawl
in
over
his
body
bunny
my
boy
and
i
you
will
hand
me
what
i
want
and
hold
the
fort
in
case
of
accidents
and
generally
lend
me
the
moral
support
you
made
me
require
it
a
luxury
bunny
but
i
found
it
devilish
difficult
to
do
without
it
after
you
turned
pi
he
said
that
von
heumann
was
certain
to
sleep
with
a
bolted
door
which
he
of
course
would
leave
unbolted
and
spoke
of
other
ways
of
laying
a
false
scent
while
rifling
the
cabin
not
that
raffles
anticipated
a
tiresome
search
the
pearl
would
be
about
von
heumann
person
in
fact
raffles
knew
exactly
where
and
in
what
he
kept
it
naturally
i
asked
how
he
could
have
come
by
such
knowledge
and
his
answer
led
up
to
a
momentary
unpleasantness
it
a
very
old
story
bunny
i
really
forget
in
what
book
it
comes
i
only
sure
of
the
testament
but
samson
was
the
unlucky
hero
and
one
delilah
the
heroine
and
he
looked
so
knowing
that
i
could
not
be
in
a
moment
doubt
as
to
his
meaning
so
the
fair
australian
has
been
playing
delilah
said
i
in
a
very
harmless
innocent
sort
of
way
she
got
his
mission
out
of
him
yes
i
forced
him
to
score
all
the
points
he
could
and
that
was
his
great
stroke
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
he
has
even
shown
amy
the
pearl
amy
eh
and
she
promptly
told
you
nothing
of
the
kind
what
makes
you
think
so
i
had
the
greatest
trouble
in
getting
it
out
of
her
his
tone
should
have
been
a
sufficient
warning
to
me
i
had
not
the
tact
to
take
it
as
such
at
last
i
knew
the
meaning
of
his
furious
flirtation
and
stood
wagging
my
head
and
shaking
my
finger
blinded
to
his
frowns
by
my
own
enlightenment
wily
worm
said
i
now
i
see
through
it
all
how
dense
i
been
sure
you
not
still
no
now
i
understand
what
has
beaten
me
all
the
week
i
simply
could
fathom
what
you
saw
in
that
little
girl
i
never
dreamt
it
was
part
of
the
game
so
you
think
it
was
that
and
nothing
more
you
deep
old
dog
of
course
i
do
you
did
know
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
squatter
there
are
wealthy
women
by
the
dozen
who
would
marry
you
it
does
occur
to
you
that
i
might
like
to
draw
stumps
start
clean
and
live
happily
ever
after
in
the
bush
with
that
voice
it
certainly
does
not
bunny
he
cried
so
fiercely
that
i
braced
myself
for
a
blow
but
no
more
followed
do
you
think
you
would
live
happily
i
made
bold
to
ask
him
god
knows
he
answered
and
with
that
he
left
me
to
marvel
at
his
look
and
tone
and
more
than
ever
at
the
insufficiently
exciting
cause
iii
of
all
the
mere
feats
of
cracksmanship
which
i
have
seen
raffles
perform
at
once
the
most
delicate
and
most
difficult
was
that
which
he
accomplished
between
one
and
two
on
the
tuesday
morning
aboard
the
north
german
steamer
uhlan
lying
at
anchor
in
genoa
harbor
not
a
hitch
occurred
everything
had
been
foreseen
everything
happened
as
i
had
been
assured
everything
must
nobody
was
about
below
only
the
ship
boys
on
deck
and
nobody
on
the
bridge
it
was
minutes
past
one
when
raffles
without
a
stitch
of
clothing
on
his
body
but
with
a
glass
phial
corked
with
between
his
teeth
and
a
tiny
behind
his
ear
squirmed
feet
first
through
the
ventilator
over
his
berth
and
it
was
nineteen
minutes
to
two
when
he
returned
head
first
with
the
phial
still
between
his
teeth
and
the
rammed
home
to
still
the
rattling
of
that
which
lay
like
a
great
gray
bean
within
he
had
taken
screws
out
and
put
them
in
again
he
had
unfastened
von
heumann
ventilator
and
had
left
it
fast
as
he
had
found
it
fast
as
he
instantly
proceeded
to
make
his
own
as
for
von
heumann
it
had
been
enough
to
place
the
drenched
wad
first
on
his
mustache
and
then
to
hold
it
between
his
gaping
lips
thereafter
the
intruder
had
climbed
both
ways
across
his
shins
without
eliciting
a
groan
and
here
was
the
prize
this
pearl
as
large
as
a
filbert
with
a
pale
pink
tinge
like
a
lady
fingernail
this
spoil
of
a
filibustering
age
this
gift
from
a
european
emperor
to
a
south
sea
chief
we
gloated
over
it
when
all
was
snug
we
toasted
it
in
whiskey
and
laid
in
overnight
in
view
of
the
great
moment
but
the
moment
was
greater
more
triumphant
than
our
most
sanguine
dreams
all
we
had
now
to
do
was
to
secrete
the
gem
which
raffles
had
prised
from
its
setting
replacing
the
latter
so
that
we
could
stand
the
strictest
search
and
yet
take
it
ashore
with
us
at
naples
and
this
raffles
was
doing
when
i
turned
in
i
myself
would
have
landed
incontinently
that
night
at
genoa
and
bolted
with
the
spoil
he
would
not
hear
of
it
for
a
dozen
good
reasons
which
will
be
obvious
on
the
whole
i
do
not
think
that
anything
was
discovered
or
suspected
before
we
weighed
anchor
but
i
can
not
be
sure
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
a
man
could
be
chloroformed
in
his
sleep
and
feel
no
effects
sniff
no
suspicious
odor
in
the
morning
nevertheless
von
heumann
reappeared
as
though
nothing
had
happened
to
him
his
german
cap
over
his
eyes
and
his
mustaches
brushing
the
peak
and
by
ten
we
were
quit
of
genoa
the
last
lean
official
had
left
our
decks
the
last
fruitseller
had
been
beaten
off
with
bucketsful
of
water
and
left
cursing
us
from
his
boat
the
last
passenger
had
come
aboard
at
the
last
moment
a
fussy
graybeard
who
kept
the
big
ship
waiting
while
he
haggled
with
his
boatman
over
half
a
lira
but
at
length
we
were
off
the
tug
was
shed
the
lighthouse
passed
and
raffles
and
i
leaned
together
over
the
rail
watching
our
shadows
on
the
pale
green
liquid
veined
marble
that
again
washed
the
vessel
side
von
heumann
was
having
his
innings
once
more
it
was
part
of
the
design
that
he
should
remain
in
all
day
and
so
postpone
the
inevitable
hour
and
though
the
lady
looked
bored
and
was
for
ever
glancing
in
our
direction
he
seemed
only
too
willing
to
avail
himself
of
his
opportunities
but
raffles
was
moody
and
he
had
not
the
air
of
a
successful
man
i
could
but
opine
that
the
impending
parting
at
naples
sat
heavily
on
his
spirit
he
would
neither
talk
to
me
nor
would
he
let
me
go
stop
where
you
are
bunny
i
things
to
tell
you
can
you
swim
a
bit
ten
miles
ten
i
burst
out
laughing
not
one
why
do
you
ask
we
shall
be
within
a
ten
miles
swim
of
the
shore
most
of
the
day
what
on
earth
are
you
driving
at
raffles
nothing
only
i
shall
swim
for
it
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
i
suppose
you
ca
swim
under
water
at
all
i
did
not
answer
his
question
i
scarcely
heard
it
cold
beads
were
bursting
through
my
skin
why
should
the
worst
come
to
the
worst
i
whispered
we
found
out
are
we
no
then
why
speak
as
though
we
were
we
may
be
an
old
enemy
of
ours
is
on
board
an
old
enemy
mackenzie
never
the
man
with
the
beard
who
came
aboard
last
are
you
sure
sure
i
was
only
sorry
to
see
you
did
recognize
him
too
i
took
my
handkerchief
to
my
face
now
that
i
thought
of
it
there
had
been
something
familiar
in
the
old
man
gait
as
well
as
something
rather
youthful
for
his
apparent
years
his
very
beard
seemed
unconvincing
now
that
i
recalled
it
in
the
light
of
this
horrible
revelation
i
looked
up
and
down
the
deck
but
the
old
man
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
that
the
worst
of
it
said
raffles
i
saw
him
go
into
the
captain
cabin
twenty
minutes
ago
but
what
can
have
brought
him
i
cried
miserably
can
it
be
a
coincidence
is
it
somebody
else
he
after
raffles
shook
his
head
hardly
this
time
then
you
think
he
after
you
i
been
afraid
of
it
for
some
weeks
yet
there
you
stand
what
am
i
to
do
i
do
want
to
swim
for
it
before
i
must
i
begin
to
wish
i
taken
your
advice
bunny
and
left
the
ship
at
genoa
but
i
not
the
smallest
doubt
that
mac
was
watching
both
ship
and
station
till
the
last
moment
that
why
he
ran
it
so
fine
he
took
a
cigarette
and
handed
me
the
case
but
i
shook
my
head
impatiently
i
still
do
understand
said
i
why
should
he
be
after
you
he
could
come
all
this
way
about
a
jewel
which
was
perfectly
safe
for
all
he
knew
what
your
own
theory
simply
that
he
been
on
my
track
for
some
time
probably
ever
since
friend
crawshay
slipped
clean
through
his
fingers
last
november
there
have
been
other
indications
i
am
really
not
unprepared
for
this
but
it
can
only
be
pure
suspicion
i
defy
him
to
bring
anything
home
and
i
defy
him
to
find
the
pearl
theory
my
dear
bunny
i
know
how
he
got
here
as
well
as
though
i
been
inside
that
skin
and
i
know
what
he
do
next
he
found
out
i
gone
abroad
and
looked
for
a
motive
he
found
out
about
von
heumann
and
his
mission
and
there
was
his
motive
great
chance
to
nab
me
on
a
new
job
altogether
but
he
wo
do
it
bunny
mark
my
words
search
the
ship
and
search
us
all
when
the
loss
is
known
but
search
in
vain
and
there
the
skipper
beckoning
the
whippersnapper
to
his
cabin
the
fat
will
be
in
the
fire
in
five
minutes
yet
there
was
no
conflagration
no
fuss
no
searching
of
the
passengers
no
whisper
of
what
had
happened
in
the
air
instead
of
a
stir
there
was
portentous
peace
and
it
was
clear
to
me
that
raffles
was
not
a
little
disturbed
at
the
falsification
of
all
his
predictions
there
was
something
sinister
in
silence
under
such
a
loss
and
the
silence
was
sustained
for
hours
during
which
mackenzie
never
reappeared
but
he
was
abroad
during
the
he
was
in
our
cabin
i
had
left
my
book
in
raffles
berth
and
in
taking
it
after
lunch
i
touched
the
quilt
it
was
warm
from
the
recent
pressure
of
flesh
and
blood
and
on
an
instinct
i
sprang
to
the
ventilator
as
i
opened
it
the
ventilator
opposite
was
closed
with
a
snap
i
waylaid
raffles
all
right
let
him
find
the
pearl
have
you
dumped
it
overboard
that
a
question
i
sha
condescend
to
answer
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
at
subsequent
intervals
i
saw
him
making
the
most
of
his
last
afternoon
with
the
inevitable
miss
werner
i
remember
that
she
looked
both
cool
and
smart
in
quite
a
simple
affair
of
brown
holland
which
toned
well
with
her
complexion
and
was
cleverly
relieved
with
touches
of
scarlet
i
quite
admired
her
that
afternoon
for
her
eyes
were
really
very
good
and
so
were
her
teeth
yet
i
had
never
admired
her
more
directly
in
my
own
despite
for
i
passed
them
again
and
again
in
order
to
get
a
word
with
raffles
to
tell
him
i
knew
there
was
danger
in
the
wind
but
he
would
not
so
much
as
catch
my
eye
so
at
last
i
gave
it
up
and
i
saw
him
next
in
the
captain
cabin
they
had
summoned
him
first
he
had
gone
in
smiling
and
smiling
i
found
him
when
they
summoned
me
the
was
spacious
as
befitted
that
of
a
commander
mackenzie
sat
on
the
settee
his
beard
in
front
of
him
on
the
polished
table
but
a
revolver
lay
in
front
of
the
captain
and
when
i
had
entered
the
chief
officer
who
had
summoned
me
shut
the
door
and
put
his
back
to
it
von
heumann
completed
the
party
his
fingers
busy
with
his
mustache
raffles
greeted
me
this
is
a
great
joke
he
cried
you
remember
the
pearl
you
were
so
keen
about
bunny
the
emperor
pearl
the
pearl
money
would
buy
it
seems
it
was
entrusted
to
our
little
friend
here
to
take
out
to
canoodle
dum
and
the
poor
little
chap
gone
and
lost
it
ergo
as
we
britishers
they
think
we
got
it
but
i
know
ye
have
put
in
mackenzie
nodding
to
his
beard
you
will
recognize
that
loyal
and
patriotic
voice
said
raffles
mon
is
our
auld
acquaintance
mackenzie
o
scoteland
yarrd
scoteland
itsel
dat
is
enough
cried
the
captain
have
you
submid
to
be
searge
or
do
i
vorce
you
what
you
will
said
raffles
but
it
will
do
you
no
harm
to
give
us
fair
play
first
you
accuse
us
of
breaking
into
captain
von
during
the
small
hours
of
this
morning
and
abstracting
from
it
this
confounded
pearl
well
i
can
prove
that
i
was
in
my
own
room
all
night
long
and
i
have
no
doubt
my
friend
can
prove
the
same
most
certainly
i
can
said
i
indignantly
the
ship
boys
can
bear
witness
to
that
mackenzie
laughed
and
shook
his
head
at
his
reflection
in
the
polished
mahogany
that
was
ver
clever
said
he
and
like
enough
it
would
ha
served
ye
had
i
not
stepped
aboard
but
i
just
had
a
look
at
they
ventilators
and
i
think
i
know
how
ye
worrked
it
anyway
captain
it
makes
no
matter
i
just
be
clappin
the
derbies
on
these
young
sparks
an
then
by
what
right
roared
raffles
in
a
ringing
voice
and
i
never
saw
his
face
in
such
a
blaze
search
us
if
you
like
search
every
scrap
and
stitch
we
possess
but
you
dare
to
lay
a
finger
on
us
without
a
warrant
i
wouldna
dare
said
mackenzie
as
he
fumbled
in
his
breast
pocket
and
raffles
dived
his
hand
into
his
own
haud
his
wrist
shouted
the
scotchman
and
the
huge
colt
that
had
been
with
us
many
a
night
but
had
never
been
fired
in
my
hearing
clattered
on
the
table
and
was
raked
in
by
the
captain
all
right
said
raffles
savagely
to
the
mate
you
can
let
go
now
i
wo
try
it
again
now
mackenzie
let
see
your
warrant
ye
no
mishandle
it
what
good
would
that
do
me
let
me
see
it
said
raffles
peremptorily
and
the
detective
obeyed
raffles
raised
his
eyebrows
as
he
perused
the
document
his
mouth
hardened
but
suddenly
relaxed
and
it
was
with
a
smile
and
a
shrug
that
he
returned
the
paper
wull
that
do
for
ye
inquired
mackenzie
it
may
i
congratulate
you
mackenzie
it
a
strong
hand
at
any
rate
two
burglaries
and
the
melrose
necklace
bunny
and
he
turned
to
me
with
a
rueful
smile
an
all
easy
to
prove
said
the
scotchman
pocketing
the
warrant
i
one
o
these
for
you
he
added
nodding
to
me
only
not
such
a
long
one
to
think
said
the
captain
reproachfully
that
my
shib
should
be
made
a
den
of
thiefs
it
shall
be
a
very
disagreeable
madder
i
have
been
obliged
to
pud
you
both
in
irons
until
we
get
to
nables
surely
not
exclaimed
raffles
mackenzie
intercede
with
him
give
your
countrymen
away
before
all
hands
captain
we
ca
escape
surely
you
could
hush
it
up
for
the
night
look
here
everything
i
have
in
my
pockets
you
empty
yours
too
bunny
and
they
shall
strip
us
stark
if
they
suspect
we
weapons
up
our
sleeves
all
i
ask
is
that
we
are
allowed
to
get
out
of
this
without
gyves
upon
our
wrists
webbons
you
may
not
have
said
the
captain
but
wad
aboud
der
bearl
dat
you
were
sdealing
you
shall
have
it
cried
raffles
you
shall
have
it
this
minute
if
you
guarantee
no
public
indignity
on
board
that
i
see
to
said
mackenzie
as
long
as
you
behave
yourselves
there
now
where
on
the
table
under
your
nose
my
eyes
fell
with
the
rest
but
no
pearl
was
there
only
the
contents
of
our
pockets
our
watches
pencils
penknives
cigarette
cases
lay
on
the
shiny
table
along
with
the
revolvers
already
mentioned
ye
humbuggin
us
said
mackenzie
what
the
use
i
doing
nothing
of
the
sort
laughed
raffles
i
testing
you
where
the
harm
it
here
joke
apart
on
that
table
by
all
my
gods
mackenzie
opened
the
cigarette
cases
and
shook
each
particular
cigarette
thereupon
raffles
prayed
to
be
allowed
to
smoke
one
and
when
his
prayer
was
heard
observed
that
the
pearl
had
been
on
the
table
much
longer
than
the
cigarettes
mackenzie
promptly
caught
up
the
colt
and
opened
the
chamber
in
the
butt
not
there
not
there
said
raffles
but
you
getting
hot
try
the
cartridges
mackenzie
emptied
them
into
his
palm
and
shook
each
one
at
his
ear
without
result
oh
give
them
to
me
and
in
an
instant
raffles
had
found
the
right
one
had
bitten
out
the
bullet
and
placed
the
emperor
pearl
with
a
flourish
in
the
centre
of
the
table
after
that
you
will
perhaps
show
me
such
little
consideration
as
is
in
your
power
captain
i
have
been
a
bit
of
a
villain
as
you
see
and
as
such
i
am
ready
and
willing
to
lie
in
irons
all
night
if
you
deem
it
requisite
for
the
safety
of
the
ship
all
i
ask
is
that
you
do
me
one
favor
first
that
shall
debend
on
wad
der
vafour
has
been
captain
i
done
a
worse
thing
aboard
your
ship
than
any
of
you
know
i
have
become
engaged
to
be
married
and
i
want
to
say
i
suppose
we
were
all
equally
amazed
but
the
only
one
to
express
his
amazement
was
von
heumann
whose
german
oath
was
almost
his
first
contribution
to
the
proceedings
he
was
not
slow
to
follow
it
however
with
a
vigorous
protest
against
the
proposed
farewell
but
he
was
overruled
and
the
masterful
prisoner
had
his
way
he
was
to
have
five
minutes
with
the
girl
while
the
captain
and
mackenzie
stood
within
range
but
not
earshot
with
their
revolvers
behind
their
backs
as
we
were
moving
from
the
cabin
in
a
body
he
stopped
and
gripped
my
hand
so
i
let
you
in
at
last
bunny
at
last
and
after
all
if
you
knew
how
sorry
i
am
but
you
wo
get
much
i
do
see
why
you
should
get
anything
at
all
can
you
forgive
me
this
may
be
for
years
and
it
may
be
for
ever
you
know
you
were
a
good
pal
always
when
it
came
to
the
scratch
some
day
or
other
you
may
be
so
sorry
to
remember
you
were
a
good
pal
at
the
last
there
was
a
meaning
in
his
eye
that
i
understood
and
my
teeth
were
set
and
my
nerve
strung
ready
as
i
wrung
that
strong
and
cunning
hand
for
the
last
time
in
my
life
how
that
last
scene
stays
with
me
and
will
stay
to
my
death
how
i
see
every
detail
every
shadow
on
the
sunlit
deck
we
were
among
the
islands
that
dot
the
course
from
genoa
to
naples
that
was
elba
falling
back
on
our
starboard
quarter
that
purple
patch
with
the
hot
sun
setting
over
it
the
captain
cabin
opened
to
starboard
and
the
starboard
promenade
deck
sheeted
with
sunshine
and
scored
with
shadow
was
deserted
but
for
the
group
of
which
i
was
one
and
for
the
pale
slim
brown
figure
further
aft
with
raffles
engaged
i
could
not
believe
it
can
not
to
this
day
yet
there
they
stood
together
and
we
did
not
hear
a
word
there
they
stood
out
against
the
sunset
and
the
long
dazzling
highway
of
sunlit
sea
that
sparkled
from
elba
to
the
uhlan
plates
and
their
shadows
reached
almost
to
our
feet
suddenly
an
instant
and
the
thing
was
done
a
thing
i
have
never
known
whether
to
admire
or
to
detest
he
caught
her
he
kissed
her
before
us
all
then
flung
her
from
him
so
that
she
almost
fell
it
was
that
action
which
foretold
the
next
the
mate
sprang
after
him
and
i
sprang
after
the
mate
raffles
was
on
the
rail
but
only
just
hold
him
bunny
he
cried
hold
him
tight
and
as
i
obeyed
that
last
behest
with
all
my
might
without
a
thought
of
what
i
was
doing
save
that
he
bade
me
do
it
i
saw
his
hands
shoot
up
and
his
head
bob
down
and
his
lithe
spare
body
cut
the
sunset
as
cleanly
and
precisely
as
though
he
had
plunged
at
his
leisure
from
a
diver
board
of
what
followed
on
deck
i
can
tell
you
nothing
for
i
was
not
there
nor
can
my
final
punishment
my
long
imprisonment
my
everlasting
disgrace
concern
or
profit
you
beyond
the
interest
and
advantage
to
be
gleaned
from
the
knowledge
that
i
at
least
had
my
deserts
but
one
thing
i
must
set
down
believe
it
who
will
one
more
thing
only
and
i
am
done
it
was
into
a
cabin
on
the
starboard
side
that
i
was
promptly
thrust
in
irons
and
the
door
locked
upon
me
as
though
i
were
another
raffles
meanwhile
a
boat
was
lowered
and
the
sea
scoured
to
no
purpose
as
is
doubtless
on
record
elsewhere
but
either
the
setting
sun
flashing
over
the
waves
must
have
blinded
all
eyes
or
else
mine
were
victims
of
a
strange
illusion
for
the
boat
was
back
the
screw
throbbing
and
the
prisoner
peering
through
his
porthole
across
the
sunlit
waters
that
he
believed
had
closed
for
ever
over
his
comrade
head
suddenly
the
sun
sank
behind
the
island
of
elba
the
lane
of
dancing
sunlight
was
instantaneously
quenched
and
swallowed
in
the
trackless
waste
and
in
the
middle
distance
already
miles
astern
either
my
sight
deceived
me
or
a
black
speck
bobbed
amid
the
gray
the
bugle
had
blown
for
dinner
it
may
well
be
that
all
save
myself
had
ceased
to
strain
an
eye
and
now
i
lost
what
i
had
found
now
it
rose
now
sank
and
now
i
gave
it
up
utterly
yet
anon
it
would
rise
again
a
mere
mote
dancing
in
the
dim
gray
distance
drifting
towards
a
purple
island
beneath
a
fading
western
sky
streaked
with
dead
gold
and
cerise
and
night
fell
before
i
knew
whether
it
was
a
human
head
or
not
