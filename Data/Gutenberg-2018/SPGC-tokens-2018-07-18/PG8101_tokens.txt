what

best
age
peter
ibbetson
entering
dreamland
with
complete
freedom
to
choose
chose
and
kept
there
but
for
our
present
purpose
has
a
drawback
a
man
of
that
age
if
endowed
with
ordinary
gifts
and
responsive
to
ordinary
opportunities
is
undeniably
a
man
whereas
what
we
require
here
is
something
just
a
little
short
of
that
wanted
in
fact
a
young
male
who
shall
seem
fully
adult
to
those
who
are
younger
still
and
who
may
even
appear
the
accomplished
flower
of
virility
to
an
idealizing
maid
or
so
yet
who
shall
elicit
from
the
the
kindly
indulgence
due
a
boy
perhaps
you
will
say
that
even
a
man
of
may
seem
only
a
boy
to
a
man
of
seventy
however
no
septuagenarian
is
to
figure
in
these
pages
our
elders
will
be
but
in
the
middle
forties
and
the
earlier
fifties
and
we
must
find
for
them
an
age
which
may
evoke
their
friendly
interest
and
yet
be
likely
to
call
forth
besides
that
their
sympathy
and
their
longing
admiration
and
later
their
tolerance
their
patience
and
even
their
forgiveness
i
think
then
that
bertram
cope
when
he
began
to
intrigue
the
little
group
which
dwelt
among
the
quadruple
avenues
of
elms
that
led
to
the
campus
in
churchton
was
but
about
certainly
not
a
day
more
than
if
is
the
ideal
age
the
best
is
all
the
better
for
being
just
a
little
ahead
of
course
cope
was
not
an
undergraduate
a
species
upon
which
many
of
the
churchtonians
languidly
refused
to
bestow
their
regard
they
come
and
they
go
said
these
prosperous
and
comfortable
burghers
and
after
all
they
more
or
less
alike
and
more
or
less
unrewarding
besides
the
bigger
town
with
all
its
rich
resources
and
all
its
varied
opportunities
lay
but
an
hour
away
churchton
lived
much
of
its
real
life
beyond
its
own
limits
and
the
student
who
came
to
be
entertained
socially
within
them
was
the
exception
indeed
no
bertram
cope
was
not
an
undergraduate
he
was
an
instructor
and
he
was
working
along
in
a
leisurely
way
to
a
degree
he
expected
to
be
an
or
even
a
possibly
a
might
be
within
the
gift
of
later
years
but
anyhow
nothing
was
finer
than
writing
except
lecturing
about
it
why
have
we
known
you
before
medora
phillips
asked
him
at
a
small
reception
phillips
spoke
out
loudly
and
boldly
and
held
his
hand
as
long
as
she
liked
no
not
as
long
as
she
liked
but
longer
than
most
women
would
have
felt
at
liberty
to
do
and
besides
speaking
loudly
and
boldly
she
looked
loudly
and
boldly
and
she
employed
a
determined
smile
which
seemed
to
say
i
old
enough
to
do
as
i
please
her
brusque
informality
was
expected
to
carry
itself
off
and
much
else
besides
of
course
i
simply
be
half
so
intrepid
as
i
seem
it
said
everybody
about
us
understands
that
and
i
must
ask
your
recognition
too
for
an
ascertained
fact
known
me
returned
cope
promptly
enough
why
you
have
known
me
because
i
have
been
here
to
known
he
spoke
in
a
ringing
resonant
voice
returning
her
unabashed
pressure
with
a
hearty
good
will
and
blazing
down
upon
her
through
his
clear
blue
eyes
with
a
high
degree
of
even
of
insouciance
and
he
explained
with
a
liberal
exhibition
of
perfect
teeth
that
for
the
two
years
following
his
graduation
he
had
been
teaching
literature
at
a
small
college
in
wisconsin
and
that
he
had
lately
come
back
to
alma
mater
for
another
bout
i
after
that
degree
he
concluded
have
been
here
she
returned
but
you
been
here
you
must
have
been
here
for
years
for
four
anyhow
so
why
have
we
she
began
again
here
as
an
undergraduate
yes
he
acknowledged
unregarded
dust
dirt
beneath
your
feet
in
rainy
weather
mud
mud
echoed
medora
phillips
loudly
with
an
increased
pressure
on
his
long
narrow
hand
why
babylon
was
built
of
mud
of
mud
bricks
anyway
and
the
hanging
gardens
she
still
clung
looking
up
his
slopes
terrace
by
terrace
cope
kept
his
and
smiled
brilliantly
gracious
he
said
no
less
resonant
than
before
am
i
a
landscape
garden
am
i
a
am
i
a
medora
phillips
finally
dropped
his
hand
you
a
wicked
unappreciative
boy
she
declared
i
do
know
whether
to
ask
you
to
my
house
or
not
but
you
may
make
yourself
useful
in
house
at
least
run
along
over
to
that
corner
and
see
if
you
ca
get
me
a
cup
of
tea
cope
bowed
and
smiled
and
stepped
toward
the
his
head
once
turned
the
smile
took
on
a
wry
twist
he
was
no
squire
of
dames
no
frequenter
of
afternoon
receptions
why
the
deuce
had
he
come
to
this
one
why
had
he
yielded
so
readily
to
the
urgings
of
the
professor
of
mathematics
himself
urged
in
turn
perhaps
by
a
wife
for
whose
little
affair
one
extra
man
at
the
opening
of
the
fall
season
counted
and
counted
hugely
why
must
he
now
expose
himself
to
the
boundless
aplomb
and
momentum
of
this
woman
of
who
was
finding
amusement
in
treating
him
as
a
college
boy
boy
indeed
she
had
actually
called
him
well
perhaps
his
present
position
made
all
this
possible
he
was
not
yet
out
in
the
world
on
his
own
in
the
background
of
down
state
was
a
father
with
a
purse
in
his
pocket
and
a
hand
to
open
the
purse
though
the
purse
was
small
and
the
hand
reluctant
he
must
partly
depend
on
both
for
another
year
if
he
were
only
in
business
if
he
were
only
a
broker
or
even
a
salesman
he
should
not
find
himself
treated
with
such
blunt
informality
and
condescension
as
a
youth
if
within
the
university
itself
he
were
but
a
real
member
of
the
faculty
with
an
assured
position
and
an
assured
salary
he
should
not
have
to
lie
open
to
the
unceremonious
hectorings
of
the
socially
confident
the
placed
he
regained
his
smile
on
the
way
across
the
room
and
the
young
creature
behind
the
samovar
who
had
had
a
moment
fear
that
she
must
deal
with
severity
found
that
a
beaming
affability
though
personally
unticketed
in
her
memory
was
after
all
her
happier
allotment
in
her
reaction
she
took
it
all
as
a
personal
compliment
she
could
not
know
of
course
that
it
was
but
a
piece
of
calculated
expressiveness
fitted
to
a
social
function
and
doubly
overdone
as
the
own
reaction
from
the
sprouting
indignation
of
the
moment
before
she
hoped
that
her
hair
under
his
sweeping
advance
was
blowing
across
her
forehead
as
lightly
and
carelessly
as
it
ought
to
and
that
his
taste
in
marquise
rings
might
be
substantially
the
same
as
hers
she
faced
the
quite
unknown
and
asked
it
sweetly
one
lump
or
two
the
dickens
how
do
know
he
thought
an
extra
one
on
the
saucer
please
he
said
aloud
with
his
natural
resonance
but
slightly
hushed
and
his
blue
eyes
clear
and
rather
cold
and
hard
blazed
down
in
turn
on
her
why
what
a
nice
friendly
fellow
exclaimed
phillips
on
receiving
her
refreshment
both
kinds
of
sandwiches
she
continued
peering
round
her
cup
were
there
three
she
asked
with
sudden
shrewdness
there
were
macaroons
he
replied
and
there
was
some
sort
of
it
was
too
sticky
these
are
more
sensible
never
mind
sense
if
there
is
cake
i
want
it
tell
amy
to
put
it
on
a
plate
amy
yes
amy
amy
your
amy
off
with
you
parrot
and
bring
a
fork
too
cope
lapsed
back
into
his
frown
and
recrossed
the
room
the
girl
behind
the
samovar
felt
that
her
hair
was
unbecoming
after
all
and
that
her
ring
borrowed
for
the
occasion
was
in
bad
taste
cope
turned
back
with
his
plate
of
cake
and
his
fork
well
he
had
been
promoted
from
a
boy
to
a
fellow
but
must
he
continue
a
kind
of
methodical
through
a
sublimated
butler
pantry
that
right
declared
phillips
on
his
return
as
she
looked
lingeringly
at
his
shapely
thumb
above
the
edge
of
the
plate
come
we
will
sit
down
together
on
this
sofa
and
you
shall
tell
me
all
about
yourself
she
looked
admiringly
at
his
blue
serge
knees
as
he
settled
down
into
place
they
were
slightly
bony
perhaps
but
then
as
she
told
herself
he
is
still
quite
young
who
would
want
him
anything
but
slender
even
spare
if
need
be
as
they
sat
there
together
she
plying
him
with
questions
and
he
restored
to
good
humor
replying
or
parrying
with
an
unembarrassed
exuberance
a
man
who
stood
just
within
the
curtained
doorway
and
flicked
a
small
graying
moustache
with
the
point
of
his
forefinger
took
in
the
scene
with
a
studious
regard
every
small
educational
community
has
its
scholar
its
haunter
of
academic
shades
or
its
intermittent
dabbler
in
their
charms
and
basil
randolph
held
that
role
in
churchton
no
alumnus
himself
he
viewed
year
after
year
the
passing
procession
of
undergraduates
who
possessed
in
their
young
present
so
much
that
he
had
left
behind
or
had
never
had
at
all
and
who
were
walking
potentially
toward
a
promising
future
in
which
he
could
take
no
share
most
of
these
had
been
commonplace
young
fellows
enough
noisy
philistine
glaringly
cursory
and
inconsiderate
toward
their
elders
but
a
few
of
them
one
now
and
then
at
long
intervals
he
would
have
enjoyed
knowing
and
knowing
intimately
on
these
infrequent
occasions
would
come
a
union
of
frankness
comeliness
and
and
the
rudiments
of
good
manners
but
no
one
in
all
the
procession
had
stopped
to
look
at
him
a
second
time
and
now
he
was
turning
gray
he
was
tragically
threatened
with
what
might
in
time
become
a
paunch
his
kind
heart
his
forthreaching
nature
went
for
naught
and
the
young
men
let
him
walk
under
the
elms
and
the
neglected
if
they
had
any
interest
beyond
their
egos
their
fraternities
and
conceivably
their
studies
that
interest
dribbled
away
on
the
quadrangle
that
housed
the
girl
students
if
they
only
realized
how
much
a
friendly
hand
extended
to
them
from
middle
life
might
do
for
their
futures
he
would
sometimes
sigh
but
the
youthful
egoists
ignoring
him
still
faced
their
respective
futures
however
uncertain
with
much
more
confidence
than
he
backed
by
whatever
assurances
and
accumulations
he
enjoyed
could
face
his
own
to
be
young
he
said
to
be
young
do
you
figure
basil
randolph
alongside
his
portière
as
but
the
observer
the
in
this
narrative
if
so
you
err
what
you
may
ask
a
rival
a
competitor
that
more
nearly
it
was
medora
phillips
herself
who
within
a
moment
or
two
inducted
him
into
this
role
a
gap
had
come
in
her
chat
with
cope
he
had
told
her
all
he
had
been
asked
to
tell
or
all
he
meant
to
tell
at
any
rate
he
had
been
given
abundant
opportunity
to
expatiate
upon
a
young
man
darling
subject
himself
either
she
now
had
enough
fixed
points
for
securing
the
periphery
of
his
circle
or
else
she
preferred
to
leave
some
portion
of
his
area
now
ascertained
approximately
within
a
poetic
penumbra
or
perhaps
she
wished
some
other
connoisseur
to
share
her
admiration
and
confirm
her
judgment
at
all
events
oh
randolph
she
cried
come
here
randolph
left
his
doorway
and
stepped
across
now
you
are
going
to
be
rewarded
said
the
lady
broadly
generous
you
are
going
to
meet
mr
cope
you
are
going
to
meet
she
paused
do
you
know
turning
to
the
young
man
i
have
your
first
name
why
is
that
necessary
you
not
ashamed
of
it
theodosius
philander
hieronymus
stop
please
my
name
is
bertram
never
bertram
why
not
because
that
would
be
too
exactly
right
i
might
have
guessed
and
guessed
right
or
wrong
bertram
my
name
you
hear
randolph
you
are
to
meet
bertram
cope
cope
who
had
risen
and
had
left
any
embarrassment
consequent
upon
the
short
delay
to
basil
randolph
himself
shot
out
a
hand
and
summoned
a
ready
smile
within
his
cuff
was
a
hint
for
the
construction
of
his
it
was
lean
and
sinewy
and
with
strong
power
for
emphasis
on
the
other
rather
short
fingers
and
as
he
gripped
he
beamed
beamed
just
as
warmly
or
just
as
coldly
at
all
events
just
as
speciously
as
he
had
beamed
before
for
on
a
social
occasion
one
must
slightly
heighten
good
will
all
the
more
so
if
one
be
somewhat
unaccustomed
and
even
somewhat
reluctant
phillips
caught
cope
glance
as
it
fell
in
all
its
glacial
geniality
he
looks
down
on
us
she
declared
how
down
cope
asked
well
you
taller
than
either
of
us
i
do
consider
myself
tall
he
replied
five
foot
nine
and
a
half
he
proceeded
ingenuously
is
hardly
tall
it
is
we
who
are
short
said
randolph
but
really
sir
rejoined
cope
kindly
i
should
call
you
short
what
is
an
inch
or
two
but
how
about
me
demanded
phillips
why
a
woman
may
be
anything
except
too
tall
responded
cope
candidly
but
if
she
wants
to
be
stately
well
there
was
queen
victoria
you
incorrigible
i
hope
i
not
so
short
as
that
sit
down
again
we
must
be
more
on
a
level
and
you
randolph
may
stand
and
look
down
on
us
both
i
sure
you
have
been
doing
so
anyway
for
the
past
ten
minutes
by
no
means
i
assure
you
returned
randolph
soberly
soberly
for
the
young
man
had
slipped
in
that
sir
and
he
had
been
so
kindly
about
randolph
five
foot
seven
and
a
bit
over
and
he
had
shown
himself
so
damnably
tender
toward
a
man
fairly
advanced
within
the
shadow
of
the
fifties
a
man
who
if
not
an
acknowledged
outcast
from
the
joys
of
life
would
soon
be
lagging
superfluous
on
their
rim
randolph
stood
before
them
looking
no
doubt
a
bit
vacant
and
inexpressive
please
go
and
get
amy
phillips
said
to
him
i
see
she
preparing
to
give
way
to
some
one
else
amy
who
was
a
blonde
girl
of
twenty
or
more
came
back
with
him
pleasantly
and
amiably
enough
and
her
aunt
or
whatever
she
should
turn
out
to
be
was
soon
able
to
lay
her
tongue
again
to
the
syllables
of
the
interesting
name
of
bertram
cope
thus
finally
introduced
repeated
the
facial
expressions
which
he
had
employed
already
beside
the
but
he
added
no
new
one
and
he
found
fewer
words
than
the
occasion
prompted
and
even
required
he
continued
talking
with
phillips
and
he
threw
an
occasional
remark
toward
randolph
but
now
that
all
obstacles
were
removed
from
free
converse
with
the
divinity
of
the
samovar
he
had
less
to
say
to
her
than
before
presently
the
elder
woman
herself
no
whit
offended
began
to
figure
the
younger
one
as
a
bit
nonplused
never
mind
amy
she
said
do
pity
him
and
do
scorn
him
really
quite
and
quite
chatty
or
suddenly
to
cope
himself
have
you
shown
us
already
your
whole
box
of
tricks
that
must
be
it
he
returned
well

suggested
randolph
sedately
why
what
all
this
about
said
the
questioning
glance
of
amy
if
there
was
any
offense
at
all
on
anybody
part
it
lay
in
making
too
much
of
too
little
take
back

plate

phillips
randolph

nibble
of
something

cope

do
deserve
the
privilege
oh

well
he
returned
lapsing
into
an
easy
passivity

said
amy
still
without
cognomen
and
connections

perfect

mouthful

said
randolph
here

chairs
the
hostess
herself
came
bustling
up
brightly
has
everybody
and
she
bustled
away
yes
everybody
almost
said
phillips
to
her
associates
behind
their
entertainer
back
if
you
hungry
amy
it
your
own
fault
sit
down
and
there
let
us
leave
them
our
little
group
our
cast
of
characters
everybody
almost
save
one
or
two
or
three
makes
a
sunday
afternoon
medora
phillips
was
the
widow
of
a
now
three
years
dead
in
his
younger
days
he
had
been
something
of
a
painter
and
later
in
life
as
much
a
collector
as
a
merchandizer
since
his
death
he
had
been
translated
gradually
from
the
lower
region
proper
to
mere
traffickers
on
toward
the
loftier
plane
which
harbored
the
more
select
company
of
and
some
of
his
choicer
ventures
were
still
held
together
as
a
gallery
with
a
few
of
his
own
canvases
included
and
his
surviving
partner
felt
this
collection
gave
her
good
reason
for
holding
up
her
head
among
the
arts
and
the
sciences
and
humane
letters
too
phillips
occupied
a
huge
amorphous
house
some
of
a
mile
to
the
west
of
the
campus
it
was
a
construction
in
wood
with
manifold
features
suggestive
of
the
villa
the
bungalow
the
chateau
the
palace
it
united
all
tastes
and
contravened
all
conventions
in
its
upper
story
was
the
commodious
apartment
which
was
known
in
quiet
times
as
the
and
in
livelier
times
as
the
it
was
the
mistress
ambition
to
have
the
lively
times
as
numerous
as
possible
to
dance
with
great
frequency
among
the
pictures
six
or
eight
couples
could
gyrate
here
at
once
there
was
young
blood
under
her
roof
and
there
was
young
blood
to
summon
from
outside
and
to
set
this
blood
seething
before
the
eyes
of
visiting
celebrities
in
the
arts
and
letters
was
her
dearest
wish
she
had
more
than
one
spare
bedroom
of
course
and
the
eminent
and
the
queer
were
always
welcome
for
a
sojourn
of
a
week
or
so
whether
they
came
to
read
papers
and
deliver
lectures
or
not
she
was
quite
as
well
satisfied
when
they
did
if
they
would
but
sit
upon
her
wide
veranda
in
spring
or
autumn
or
before
her
big
open
fireplace
in
winter
and
just
talk
she
would
be
as
and
as
you
pleased
this
is
much
nicer
she
would
say
nicer
than
what
she
did
not
always
make
clear
yes
the
house
was
nearly
of
a
mile
to
the
west
of
the
campus
but
it
was
twice
as
far
as
if
it
had
been
north
or
south
trains
and
trolleys
intent
on
serving
the
interests
of
the
great
majority
took
their
own
courses
and
gave
her
guests
no
aid
if
the
evening
turned
cold
or
blustery
or
brought
a
driving
rain
she
would
say
you
ca
go
out
in
this
you
must
stay
all
night
we
have
room
and
to
spare
if
she
wanted
anybody
to
stay
very
much
she
would
even
add
i
think
of
your
walking
toward
the
lake
with
such
a
gale
in
your
face
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
lake
wind
was
the
rarest
of
them
all
and
that
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
the
rain
or
snow
would
be
not
in
people
faces
but
at
their
backs
if
she
did
want
anybody
to
stay
she
simply
ordered
out
the
car
and
bundled
him
off
the
delay
in
the
offer
of
the
car
sometimes
induced
a
young
man
to
remain
tasteful
pajamas
and
the
promise
of
a
suitably
early
breakfast
assured
him
that
he
had
made
no
mistake
cope
first
call
was
made
not
on
a
tempestuous
evening
in
the
winter
time
but
on
a
quiet
sunday
afternoon
toward
the
end
of
september
the
day
was
sunny
and
the
streets
were
full
of
strollers
moving
along
decorously
beneath
the
elms
maples
and
catalpas
drop
in
some
sunday
about
five
medora
phillips
had
said
to
him
and
have
tea
the
girls
will
be
glad
to
meet
you
the
girls
who
were
they
and
how
many
he
supposed
he
could
account
for
one
of
them
at
least
but
the
others
you
find
me
alone
after
all
was
her
greeting
the
girls
are
out
walking
with
each
other
or
their
beaux
or
whatever
come
in
here
she
led
him
into
a
spacious
room
cluttered
with
lambrequins
stringy
portieres
grilles
the
fine
weather
has
been
too
much
for
them
she
proceeded
i
was
relying
on
them
to
entertain
you
dear
me
am
i
to
be
entertained
of
course
you
are
her
expression
and
inflection
indicated
to
him
that
he
had
been
caught
up
in
the
cogs
of
a
sizable
machine
and
that
he
was
to
be
put
through
it
everybody
who
came
was
entertained
or
helped
entertain
others
entertainment
in
fact
was
the
one
object
of
the
establishment
well
ca
you
entertain
me
yourself
perhaps
i
can
and
it
almost
seemed
as
if
he
had
been
secured
and
isolated
for
the
express
purpose
of
undergoing
a
particular
course
of
in
the
interval
she
amended
they
be
back
by
sunset
clever
girls
and
i
know
you
enjoy
them
she
uttered
this
belief
emphatically
so
emphatically
in
truth
that
it
came
to
mean
i
wonder
if
you
will
indeed
and
there
was
even
an
overtone
after
all
it
not
the
least
necessary
that
you
should
i
suppose
i
have
met
one
of
them
already
you
have
met
amy
but
there
are
hortense
and
carolyn
what
can
they
all
be
he
wondered
to
himself
daughters
nieces
cousins
boarders
amy
plays
hortense
paints
carolyn
is
a
poet
amy
plays
pardon
me
for
calling
her
amy
but
you
have
never
given
me
the
rest
of
her
name
i
certainly
presented
you
to
well
that
was
careless
if
true
her
name
is
amy
leffingwell
and
hortense
name
is
stop
please
pay
it
out
gradually
my
poor
head
can
hold
only
what
it
can
names
without
people
to
attach
them
to
the
people
will
be
here
presently
medora
phillips
said
rather
shortly
surely
this
young
man
was
taking
his
own
tone
it
was
not
quite
the
tone
usually
taken
by
college
boys
on
their
first
call
her
position
and
her
imposing
surroundings
yes
her
kindliness
in
noticing
him
at
all
might
surely
save
her
from
informalities
that
almost
shaped
into
impertinences
yet
on
the
other
hand
nothing
bored
one
more
than
a
young
man
who
openly
showed
himself
intimidated
what
was
there
behind
this
one
more
than
she
had
thought
well
if
so
none
the
worse
time
might
tell
so
miss
leffingwell
plays
he
flared
out
his
smile
let
me
learn
my
lesson
page
by
page
yes
she
plays
returned
medora
phillips
briefly
guess
what
she
continued
presently
half
placated
they
were
again
side
by
side
on
a
sofa
each
with
an
elbow
on
its
back
and
the
elbows
near
together
nor
was
medora
phillips
though
plump
at
all
the
graceless
dumpy
little
body
she
sometimes
taxed
herself
with
being
what
oh
piano
i
suppose
piano
what
wrong
the
piano
is
common
it
assumed
oh
she
performs
on
something
unusual
xylophone
be
serious
trombone
i
seen
wonders
done
on
that
in
a
orchestra
do
be
grotesque
she
drew
her
dark
eyebrows
into
protest
what
a
sight
a
delicate
young
girl
playing
a
trombone
well
then
a
harp
that
sometimes
a
pleasant
sight
a
harp
needs
an
express
wagon
though
of
course
it
is
pretty
for
the
arms
arms
let
me
see
the
violin
of
course
and
that
probably
the
very
first
thing
you
thought
of
why
not
have
mentioned
it
i
suppose
i
been
taught
the
duty
of
making
conversation
the
duty
not
the
pleasure
that
remains
to
be
he
paused
so
she
has
arms
he
pretended
to
muse
i
confess
i
had
quite
noticed
she
passed
you
a
cup
of
tea
did
she
oh
surely
and
a
sandwich
and
another
and
a
slice
of
layer
cake
with
a
fork
and
another
cup
of
tea
and
a
macaroon
or
two
am
i
a
glutton
am
i
some
of
all
that
provender
was
for
me
as
i
recall
they
were
still
side
by
side
on
the
sofa
both
were
cross
kneed
and
the
tip
of
her
russet
boot
almost
grazed
that
of
his
oxford
tie
he
did
not
notice
he
was
already
arranging
the
first
paragraph
of
a
letter
to
a
friend
in
winnebago
wisconsin
dear
arthur
i
called
as
i
said
i
was
going
to
she
is
a
scrapper
she
goes
at
you
hammer
and
tongs
pretending
to
quarrel
as
a
means
of
entertaining
you
medora
phillips
removed
her
elbow
from
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
began
to
prod
up
her
cushions
how
about
your
work
she
asked
what
are
you
doing
he
came
back
oh
i
boning
some
things
still
to
make
up
digging
in
the
poetry
of
gower
the
gower
well
i
see
no
reason
why
poetry
should
be
moral
has
he
been
publishing
anything
lately
that
i
ought
to
see
not
lately
i
presume
i
can
look
into
some
of
his
older
things
they
are
all
old
five
hundred
years
and
more
he
was
a
pal
of
chaucer
she
gave
him
an
indignant
glance
so
that
it
you
laying
traps
for
me
you
do
like
me
you
do
respect
me
one
of
the
recalcitrant
cushions
fell
to
the
floor
they
bumped
heads
in
trying
to
pick
it
up
traps
he
said
never
in
the
world
do
think
it
why
gower
is
just
a
necessary
old
bore
nobody
supposed
to
know
much
about
him
except
instructors
and
their
hapless
students
he
added
one
more
sentence
to
his
letter
to
arthur
she
pushes
you
pretty
hard
a
little
of
it
goes
a
good
way
oh
if
the
case
she
said
how
about
your
thesis
she
went
on
swiftly
what
are
you
going
to
write
about
i
was
thinking
of
shakespeare
shakespeare
there
you
go
again
ridiculing
me
to
my
very
face
not
at
all
there
lots
to
say
about
him
or
them
oh
you
believe
in
bacon
not
at
all
once
more
i
should
like
to
take
a
year
and
spend
it
among
the
of
warwickshire
but
i
suppose
nobody
would
stake
me
to
that
i
do
know
what
you
have
in
mind
some
wild
goose
chase
probably
i
expect
your
friends
would
like
it
better
if
you
spent
your
time
right
here
probably
i
presume
i
shall
end
by
doing
a
thesis
on
the
in
keats
and
shelley
a
penniless
devil
was
no
luck
anybody
has
luck
who
can
form
the
right
circle
stay
where
you
are
a
circle
formed
here
would
do
you
much
more
good
than
a
temporary
one
four
thousand
miles
away
voices
were
heard
in
the
front
yard
there
they
come
now
phillips
said
she
rose
and
one
more
of
the
wayward
cushions
went
to
the
floor
it
lay
there
unregarded
a
sign
that
a
promising
was
for
the
time
being
over
is
entertained
phillips
stepped
to
the
front
door
to
meet
the
half
dozen
young
people
who
were
cheerily
coming
up
the
walk
cope
looking
at
the
fallen
cushions
with
an
unseeing
eye
remained
within
the
door
to
compose
a
further
paragraph
for
the
behoof
of
his
correspondent
in
wisconsin
several
girls
helped
entertain
me
they
came
on
as
thick
as
spatter
one
played
a
few
things
on
the
violin
another
set
up
her
easel
and
painted
a
picture
for
us
a
third
wrote
a
poem
and
read
it
to
us
and
a
few
sophomores
hung
about
in
the
background
it
was
all
rather
too
much
i
found
myself
preferring
those
hours
together
in
dear
old
winnebago
only
one
of
the
sophomores
if
the
young
men
were
really
of
that
objectionable
tribe
came
indoors
with
the
young
ladies
the
others
either
engaged
elsewhere
or
consciously
unworthy
went
away
after
a
moment
or
two
on
the
front
steps
perhaps
they
did
not
feel
encouraged
and
in
fact
phillips
looked
back
toward
cope
with
the
effect
of
communicating
the
idea
that
she
had
enough
men
for
she
even
conveyed
to
him
the
notion
that
he
had
made
the
others
superfluous
but
hum
he
thought
if
there
to
be
a
lot
of
the
more
there
are
to
be
entertained
the
better
it
might
turn
out
he
met
hortense
and
carolyn
with
due
stress
laid
on
their
respective
patronymics
and
he
made
an
early
acquaintance
with
amy
violin
and
further
on
phillips
said
now
amy
before
you
really
stop
do
play
that
last
little
thing
the
dear
child
she
said
to
cope
in
a
lower
tone
composed
it
herself
and
dedicated
it
to
me
the
last
little
thing
was
a
kind
of
meditation
written
very
simply
and
performed
quite
seriously
and
unaffectedly
and
it
gave
of
course
a
good
chance
for
the
arms
there
said
phillips
at
its
close
is
it
too
sweet
and
it
inspired
carolyn
too
she
wrote
a
poem
after
hearing
it
a
copy
of
verses
corrected
carolyn
with
a
modest
catch
in
her
breath
she
was
a
quiet
sedate
girl
with
brown
eyes
and
hair
her
eyes
were
shy
and
her
hair
was
plainly
dressed
oh
you
so
sweet
so
protested
phillips
slightly
rolling
her
eyes
it
a
poem
of
course
it
a
poem
i
leave
it
to
mr
cope
if
it
is
oh
i
beg
began
cope
in
trepidation
well
listen
anyway
said
medora
the
poem
consisted
of
some
six
or
seven
brief
stanzas
its
title
was
read
formally
by
the
writer
and
quite
as
formally
the
dedication
which
intervened
between
title
and
first
stanza
a
dedication
to
medora
townsend
phillips
of
course
said
cope
to
himself
and
as
the
reading
went
on
he
ran
his
eyes
over
the
dusky
darkening
walls
he
knew
what
he
expected
to
find
just
as
he
found
it
the
sophomore
standing
between
the
big
padded
chair
and
the
spatted
his
hands
three
times
the
poem
was
over
the
patroness
duly
celebrated
cope
spatted
a
little
too
but
kept
his
eye
on
one
of
the
walls
you
looking
at
my
portrait
declared
phillips
as
the
poetess
sank
deeper
into
the
big
chair
hortense
did
it
of
course
she
did
said
cope
under
his
breath
he
transferred
an
obligatory
glance
from
the
canvas
to
the
expectant
artist
but
it
getting
almost
too
dark
to
see
it
said
his
hostess
and
suddenly
pressed
a
button
this
brought
into
play
a
row
of
electric
bulbs
near
the
top
edge
of
the
frame
and
into
full
prominence
the
dark
plumpness
of
the
subject
he
looked
back
again
from
the
painter
who
also
had
black
hair
and
eyes
to
her
work
i
am
on
parnassus
cope
declared
in
one
general
sweeping
compliment
as
he
looked
toward
the
sofa
where
medora
phillips
sat
with
the
three
girls
now
grouped
behind
her
but
he
made
it
a
boreal
parnassus
one
set
in
relief
by
the
cold
flare
and
flicker
of
northern
lights
is
he
the
dear
comical
chap
exclaimed
phillips
with
unction
glancing
upward
and
backward
at
the
girls
they
smiled
discreetly
as
if
indulging
in
a
silent
evaluation
of
the
sincerity
of
the
compliment
yet
one
of
them
hortense
formed
her
black
brows
into
a
frown
and
might
have
spoken
resentfully
save
for
a
look
from
their
general
patroness
meanwhile
how
about
a
drop
of
tea
asked
phillips
suddenly
roddy
to
the
sophomore
if
you
will
help
clear
that
table
the
youth
hastened
to
get
into
action
cope
went
on
with
his
letter
to
arthur
it
was
an
afternoon
in
lesbos
with
sappho
and
her
band
of
appreciative
maidens
phaon
a
poor
lad
of
nineteen
swept
some
pamphlets
and
off
the
and
we
all
plunged
into
the
ocean
of
oolong
the
best
thing
we
do
on
this
island
he
was
lingering
in
a
smiling
abstractedness
on
his
fancy
when
bertram
cope
a
voice
suddenly
said
do
you
do
nothing
nothing
he
suddenly
came
to
perhaps
he
had
really
deserved
his
rebuke
he
had
not
offered
to
help
with
the
he
had
preferred
no
appropriate
remark
of
an
individual
nature
to
any
of
the
three
i
mean
proceeded
phillips
can
you
do
nothing
whatever
to
entertain
cope
gained
another
stage
on
the
way
to
and
entertainment
was
doubtless
the
basic
curse
of
this
household
i
sing
he
said
with
naïf
suddenness
and
simplicity
then
sing
do
there
the
open
piano
can
you
play
your
own
accompaniments
some
of
the
simpler
ones
some
of
the
simpler
ones
do
you
hear
that
girls
he
is
quite
prepared
to
wipe
us
all
out
shall
we
let
him
that
unfair
cope
protested
is
it
my
fault
if
composers
write
hard
accompaniments
to
easy
airs
will
you
sing
before
your
tea
or
after
it
i
ready
to
sing
this
instant
during
it
or
before
it
very
well
the
room
was
now
in
dusk
save
for
the
bulbs
which
made
the
portrait
shine
forth
like
a
wayside
shrine
roddy
the
possible
sophomore
helped
a
maid
find
places
for
the
cups
and
saucers
and
the
three
girls
still
formed
in
a
careful
group
about
the
sofa
silently
waited
of
course
you
realize
that
this
is
not
such
a
very
large
room
said
phillips
meaning
well
your
speaking
voice
resonant
you
know
meaning
then
that
i
am
not
to
raise
the
roof
nor
jar
the
china
try
not
to
nor
did
he
he
sang
with
care
rather
than
with
volume
with
discretion
rather
than
with
abandon
the
simple
accompaniments
went
off
with
but
a
slight
hitch
or
two
yet
the
resonant
voice
was
somehow
somewhere
lost
possibly
cope
gave
too
great
heed
to
his
hostess
caution
but
it
seemed
as
if
a
voice
essentially
promising
had
slipped
through
some
teacher
none
too
competent
hands
or
what
was
quite
as
serious
as
if
some
temperamental
brake
were
operating
to
prevent
the
complete
expression
of
the
singer
nature
lassen
grieg
rubinstein
all
these
were
carried
through
rather
cautiously
perhaps
a
little
mechanically
and
there
was
a
silence
hortense
broke
it
parnassus
yes
and
finally
comes
apollo
she
reached
over
and
murmured
to
phillips
none
too
skillful
on
the
lyre
and
none
too
strong
in
the
lungs
medora
spoke
up
loudly
and
promptly
do
you
know
i
think
i
heard
you
sing
before
possibly
cope
said
turning
his
back
on
the
keyboard
i
sang
in
the
university
choir
for
a
year
or
two
in
gown
and
holy
spirit
and
all
that
yes
i
sang
solos
now
and
then
of
course
she
said
i
remember
now
but
i
never
saw
you
before
without
your
that
changes
the
forehead
yes
yourself
she
went
on
adding
to
her
previous
pleasure
the
further
pleasure
of
recognition
you
earned
your
tea
she
added
hortense
she
said
over
her
shoulder
to
the
dark
girl
behind
the
sofa
will
you
no
i
pour
myself
she
slid
into
her
place
at
table
and
got
things
to
going
there
was
an
interval
which
cope
might
have
employed
in
praising
the
artistic
aptitudes
of
this
variously
gifted
household
but
he
found
no
appropriate
word
to
say
or
at
least
uttered
none
and
none
of
the
three
girls
made
any
further
comment
on
his
own
performance
phillips
accompanied
him
on
his
way
out
as
far
as
the
hall
she
looked
up
at
him
questioningly
you
do
like
my
poor
girls
she
said
you
do
find
them
clever
you
do
find
them
interesting
on
the
contrary
he
rejoined
i
have
spent
a
delightful
hour
must
he
go
on
and
confess
that
he
had
developed
no
particular
dexterity
in
dealing
with
the
younger
members
of
the
opposite
sex
no
you
do
care
for
them
one
bit
she
insisted
she
tried
to
look
rebuking
reproachful
yet
some
shade
of
expression
conveyed
to
him
a
hint
that
her
protest
was
by
no
means
sincere
if
he
really
did
it
was
no
loss
it
was
even
a
possible
gain
it
you
who
do
care
for
me
he
returned
i
nonsense
she
rejoined
if
you
have
a
slight
past
that
only
makes
you
the
more
atmospheric
be
sure
you
come
again
soon
and
put
in
a
little
more
work
on
the
foreground
cope
on
his
way
eastward
in
the
early
evening
passed
near
the
trolley
tracks
the
greek
without
a
thought
he
was
continuing
his
letter
to
dear
arthur
i
think
he
wrote
with
his
mind
finger
that
you
might
as
well
come
down
i
miss
you
even
more
than
i
thought
i
should
the
term
is
young
and
you
can
enter
for
spanish
or
psychology
or
something
there
nothing
for
you
up
there
the
bishop
can
spare
you
your
father
will
be
reasonable
we
can
easily
arrange
some
suitable
quarters
and
we
await
a
reply
from
dear
arthur
the
fifth
and
last
of
our
little
group
but
no
there
are
two
or
three
others
as
you
have
just
seen
is
a
few
days
after
the
mathematical
tea
basil
randolph
was
taking
a
sedate
walk
among
the
exotic
elms
and
the
indigenous
oaks
of
the
campus
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
office
of
the
university
registrar
he
felt
interested
in
bertram
cope
and
meant
to
consult
the
authorities
that
is
to
say
he
intended
to
consult
the
written
and
printed
data
provided
by
the
authorities
not
to
make
verbal
inquiries
of
any
of
the
college
officials
themselves
he
was
after
all
sufficiently
in
the
academic
tradition
to
prefer
the
consultation
of
records
as
against
the
employment
of
methods
and
he
saw
no
reason
why
his
new
interest
should
be
widely
communicated
to
other
individuals
there
was
an
annual
register
there
was
an
album
of
loose
sheets
kept
up
by
the
members
of
the
faculty
and
there
was
a
he
remembered
in
half
a
dozen
little
drawers
all
this
ought
to
remove
any
necessity
of
putting
questions
by
word
of
mouth
the
young
clerk
behind
the
broad
counter
annoyed
him
by
no
offer
of
aid
but
left
him
to
browse
for
himself
first
the
printed
register
this
was
crowded
with
professors
full
head
associate
assistant
there
were
even
two
or
three
professors
emeritus
and
each
department
had
its
tale
of
instructors
but
no
mention
of
a
bertram
cope
of
course
not
this
volume
it
occurred
to
him
presently
represented
the
state
of
things
during
the
previous
scholastic
year
next
the
but
this
dealt
with
the
students
only
undergraduate
graduate
special
no
cope
there
remained
the
in
which
the
members
of
the
professorial
body
told
something
about
themselves
in
a
great
variety
of
handwriting
among
other
things
their
full
names
and
addresses
and
their
natures
in
so
far
as
penmanship
might
reveal
it
ca
ce
cof
collard
th
who
was
an
instructor
in
french
and
lived
on
rosemary
place
copperthwaite
julian
cotton
no
cope
he
looked
again
and
further
no
slightest
alphabetical
misplacement
you
are
not
finding
what
you
want
asked
the
clerk
at
last
the
search
was
delaying
other
inquirers
bertram
cope
said
randolph
instructor
i
think
he
has
been
slow
but
his
page
will
be
in
place
by
tomorrow
if
you
want
his
address
yes
i
think
i
can
give
it
to
you
the
youth
retired
behind
a
screen
there
he
said
returning
with
a
bit
of
pencilling
on
a
scrap
of
paper
randolph
thanked
him
folded
up
the
paper
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
a
mere
bit
of
ordinary
clerkly
writing
no
character
no
allure
well
the
actual
chirography
of
the
absentee
would
be
made
manifest
before
long
what
was
it
like
should
he
himself
ever
have
a
specimen
of
it
in
a
letter
or
a
note
that
evening
with
his
cigarette
he
strolled
casually
through
granville
avenue
the
short
street
indicated
by
the
address
it
was
a
neighborhood
of
frame
dwellings
with
yards
and
a
moderate
provision
of
trees
and
shrubs
a
neighborhood
of
people
who
owned
their
houses
but
did
not
spend
much
money
on
them
number
was
a
good
deal
like
the
others
decent
enough
but
commonplace
randolph
pronounced
yet
what
could
i
have
been
expecting
he
added
and
his
whimsical
smile
told
him
not
to
let
himself
become
absurd
there
were
lighted
windows
in
the
front
and
at
the
side
which
of
these
was
cope
and
what
was
the
boy
doing
was
he
deep
in
or
was
he
selecting
a
necktie
preliminary
to
some
evening
diversion
outside
or
had
he
put
out
his
light
several
windows
were
dark
and
already
taken
the
train
into
town
for
some
concert
or
theatre
well
said
randolph
to
himself
with
a
last
puff
at
his
cigarette
they
not
likely
to
move
out
and
leave
him
up
in
the
air
i
hope
he
went
on
that
he
has
more
than
a
bedroom
merely
but
we
know
on
what
an
incredibly
small
scale
some
of
them
live
he
threw
away
his
cigarette
and
strolled
on
to
his
own
quarters
these
were
but
ten
minutes
away
in
his
neighborhood
too
people
owned
their
homes
and
were
unlikely
to
hurry
you
out
on
a
month
notice
you
could
be
sure
of
being
able
to
stay
on
and
randolph
in
fact
had
stayed
on
with
a
suitable
family
for
three
or
four
years
he
had
a
good
part
of
one
floor
a
bedroom
a
sitting
room
with
a
liberal
provision
of
bookshelves
and
a
kind
of
large
closet
which
he
had
made
into
a
cabinet
there
are
all
sorts
of
cabinets
but
this
was
a
cabinet
for
his
collection
his
collection
was
not
without
some
measure
of
local
fame
if
not
strictly
valuable
it
was
at
least
comprehensive
after
all
he
collected
to
please
himself
he
was
a
collector
in
churchton
and
a
stockbroker
in
the
city
itself
the
satirical
said
that
he
was
the
most
important
collector
in
the
street
and
the
most
important
stockbroker
in
the
suburbs
he
was
a
member
of
a
somewhat
large
firm
and
not
the
most
active
one
his
interest
had
been
handed
down
in
a
manner
from
his
father
and
the
less
he
participated
the
better
his
partners
liked
it
he
had
no
one
but
himself
and
a
sister
on
the
far
side
of
the
city
miles
and
miles
away
his
principal
concern
was
to
please
himself
to
indulge
his
nature
and
tastes
and
to
get
in
a
quiet
way
a
good
deal
out
of
life
but
nobody
ever
spoke
of
him
as
rich
his
collection
represented
his
own
preferences
perseverance
and
individual
predilections
least
of
all
had
it
been
brought
together
to
be
realized
on
after
his
death
i
may
be
something
of
a
fool
in
my
own
meek
fashion
he
acknowledged
but
i
no
such
fool
as
that
he
had
a
few
jades
and
lacquers
among
the
latter
the
ordinary
inkwells
and
a
few
some
puppets
in
costume
from
mexico
and
italy
a
few
begrimed
books
in
foreign
languages
which
he
could
not
always
read
and
now
and
then
a
friend
who
was
breaking
up
would
give
him
a
bit
of
capo
di
monte
or
an
absurd
enigmatic
musical
instrument
from
the
east
indies
and
he
had
a
small
department
of
americana
dating
from
the
days
of
the
civil
war
miscellaneous
enough
pronounced
medora
phillips
on
once
viewing
his
cabinet
but
not
altogether
she
proceeded
charitably
utter
rubbish
and
it
was
felt
by
others
too
that
in
the
lack
of
any
wide
opportunity
he
had
done
rather
well
churchton
itself
was
no
nest
of
antiquities
in
it
had
consisted
merely
of
a
log
tavern
on
the
green
bay
road
and
the
first
white
child
born
within
its
limits
had
died
but
recently
nor
was
the
big
town
just
across
the
indian
boundary
much
older
it
had
antique
shops
true
but
one
best
chances
were
got
through
mousing
among
the
small
scattered
troups
of
foreigners
variegated
they
were
who
had
lately
been
coming
in
bringing
their
household
with
them
there
was
a
ghetto
there
was
a
little
italy
there
were
bits
of
bulgaria
bohemia
armenia
if
one
had
tired
of
dubious
louis
quinze
and
empire
in
an
atmosphere
of
general
newness
a
thing
did
not
need
to
be
very
old
to
be
an
antique
the
least
old
of
all
things
in
randolph
world
were
the
students
who
flooded
churchton
there
were
two
or
three
thousand
of
them
and
hundreds
of
new
ones
came
with
every
september
sometimes
he
felt
prompted
to
collect
them
as
contrasts
to
his
older
curios
they
were
fully
as
interesting
in
their
way
as
brasswork
and
leatherwork
those
products
of
peasant
natures
and
peasant
hands
but
these
youths
ran
past
one
eye
ran
through
one
fingers
they
were
not
static
not
even
stable
they
were
restless
birds
of
passage
who
fidgeted
through
their
years
and
even
through
the
days
of
which
the
years
were
made
intent
on
their
own
affairs
and
their
own
companions
thankless
for
small
favors
and
kind
attentions
even
unconscious
of
them
soaking
up
goodwill
and
friendly
offices
in
a
fashion
too
damnably
you
gave
them
an
evening
among
your
books
with
discreet
things
to
drink
to
smoke
to
play
at
or
you
offered
them
a
good
dinner
at
some
good
hotel
and
you
never
saw
them
after
they
said
yes
sir
or
yep
but
whether
they
pained
you
by
being
too
respectful
or
rasped
you
by
being
too
rowdyish
it
all
came
to
the
same
they
had
little
use
for
you
they
readily
forgot
and
quickly
dropped
you
i
wonder
whether
instructors
are
a
shade
better
queried
basil
randolph
or
when
do
sense
and
gratitude
and
begin
a
few
days
later
he
had
returned
to
the
faculty
cope
page
was
now
in
place
with
full
particulars
in
his
own
hand
his
interest
was
english
literature
it
appeared
h
nothing
very
special
in
that
commented
randolph
but
cope
penmanship
attracted
him
it
was
open
and
easy
he
never
gave
instructor
any
trouble
in
reading
his
themes
yet
the
hand
was
rather
boyish
was
it
formed
or
unformed
i
am
no
expert
confessed
randolph
he
put
cope
writing
on
a
middle
ground
and
let
it
go
at
that
he
recalled
the
lighted
windows
and
wondered
near
which
one
of
them
the
same
hand
filled
and
corrected
students
papers
rather
a
dreary
routine
i
imagine
for
a
young
fellow
of
his
age
still
he
may
like
it
possibly
he
thought
of
his
own
early
studies
and
of
his
own
early
he
felt
disposed
to
find
his
earlier
self
in
this
young
man
or
at
least
an
inclination
to
look
for
himself
there
the
next
afternoon
he
walked
over
to
medora
phillips
medora
upper
floor
gave
asylum
to
a
of
her
husband
an
invalid
who
seldom
saw
the
outside
world
and
who
depended
for
solace
and
entertainment
on
neighbors
of
his
own
age
and
interests
randolph
expected
to
contribute
during
the
week
about
so
many
hours
of
talk
or
of
reading
but
he
would
have
a
few
words
with
medora
before
going
up
to
joe
medora
among
her
grilles
and
lambrequins
was
only
too
willing
to
talk
about
young
cope
a
charming
fellow
in
a
way
she
said
judicially
frank
but
a
little
too
and
exuberant
but
possibly
a
bit
cold
yet
charming
oh
thought
randolph
one
of
the
cool
boys
and
one
of
the
probably
a
bit
of
an
ascetic
at
bottom
with
good
capacity
for
and
not
at
all
an
uninteresting
type
he
summed
it
up
an
ebullient
puritan
he
asked
aloud
that
it
she
declared
according
to
my
sense
of
it
yet
hardly
a
new
englander
i
suppose
not
directly
anyhow
from
down
state
from
freeford
i
think
he
said
i
judge
that
there
quite
a
family
of
them
quite
a
family
of
them
he
repeated
inwardly
a
drawback
indeed
why
could
an
interesting
young
organism
so
seldom
be
detached
from
its
milieu
and
enjoyed
in
isolation
prosy
parents
tiresome
detrimental
brothers
he
wondered
if
she
had
any
idea
what
they
were
all
like
it
might
be
just
as
well
however
not
to
know
and
judging
from
the
family
name
and
from
their
taste
at
christenings
i
should
say
there
might
be
some
slant
toward
england
itself
a
nomenclature
not
without
distinction
rather
nice
eh
and
there
is
a
sister
who
teaches
in
one
of
the
schools
i
understand
and
her
name
is
rosalind
or
rosalys
think
of
that
i
gather
that
the
father
is
in
some
business
she
concluded
well
well
thought
randolph
more
than
one
touch
of
gentility
of
fine
feeling
if
the
father
was
in
some
business
most
likely
it
was
some
one
else
business
he
sings
said
medora
further
entertained
us
the
other
sunday
afternoon
cool
and
correct
but
pleasant
no
warmth
no
passion
no
special
interest
in
any
of
my
poor
girls
i
did
feel
that
he
was
drawing
any
of
them
too
near
the
mighty
gratifying
that
where
does
one
learn
to
sing
without
provoking
danger
in
a
church
choir
of
course
he
sang
last
year
in
the
cathedral
at
winnebago
oh
in
wisconsin
and
what
took
us
to
winnebago
i
wonder
we
were
teaching
in
a
college
there
i
see
the
talk
languished
basil
randolph
had
learned
most
that
he
wanted
to
know
and
had
learned
it
without
asking
too
many
direct
questions
he
began
to
pick
at
the
fussy
fringe
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
to
cast
an
empty
eye
on
the
other
fussy
things
that
filled
the
room
the
two
had
exhausted
long
ago
all
the
old
subjects
and
he
did
not
care
to
show
an
eagerness
still
less
a
continuing
eagerness
for
this
new
one
much
could
be
picked
up
by
indirection
even
by
waiting
medora
felt
him
as
distrait
do
you
want
to
go
up
and
see
joe
for
a
little
while
before
you
leave
us
i
believe
i
will
not
that
i
brought
anything
to
read
i
doubt
if
he
cares
to
be
read
to
this
time
carolyn
gave
him
the
headlines
this
forenoon
he
a
bit
restless
i
think
he
rather
talk
if
you
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
me
perhaps
you
can
find
something
to
say
to
him
oh
come
i
sure
we
had
a
good
enough
little
chat
are
you
a
bit
restless
yourself
well
run
along
i
heard
his
chair
rolling
about
up
there
for
the
last
half
hour
is
considered
randolph
took
the
stairs
to
the
second
floor
and
presently
his
footfalls
were
heard
on
the
bare
treads
that
led
from
the
second
to
the
third
at
the
top
landing
he
paused
and
looked
in
through
the
open
door
of
the
over
the
varnished
oak
floor
of
this
roomy
apartment
a
man
who
wore
a
green
shade
above
his
eyes
was
propelling
himself
in
a
wheeled
chair
thus
did
joseph
foster
cover
the
space
where
the
younger
and
more
fortunate
sometimes
danced
and
thus
did
he
move
among
works
of
art
which
even
on
the
brightest
days
he
could
barely
see
he
knew
the
step
brought
anything
he
asked
he
depended
on
randolph
for
the
latest
brief
doings
in
current
fiction
and
usually
in
the
background
and
often
long
in
abeyance
was
something
in
the
way
of
memoirs
or
biography
which
could
fill
the
empty
hours
either
through
retrospect
or
anticipation
only
myself
replied
the
other
stepping
in
foster
dextrously
manoeuvred
his
chair
toward
the
entrance
and
reached
out
his
hand
well
yourself
is
enough
it
good
to
have
a
man
about
the
place
once
in
a
while
once
in
a
while
i
said
it
gets
tiresome
hearing
all
those
girls
slithering
and
chattering
through
the
halls
he
put
his
bony
hands
back
on
the
rims
of
his
wheels
where
have
you
been
all
this
time
oh
you
know
i
come
when
i
can
randolph
ran
his
eye
over
the
walls
of
the
big
empty
room
the
pictures
were
all
in
place
landscapes
what
not
everything
as
familiar
as
the
form
of
words
he
had
just
employed
to
meet
an
oft
repeated
query
implying
indifference
and
neglect
how
is
it
outside
i
have
been
down
on
the
street
for
a
month
oh
things
are
bright
and
pleasant
enough
through
the
wide
window
there
appeared
half
a
mile
away
the
square
twin
towers
of
the
university
library
reminiscent
of
oxford
and
ely
round
them
lesser
towers
and
gables
scholastic
in
their
gray
stone
rose
above
the
trees
of
the
campus
beyond
all
these
a
level
line
of
watery
blue
ran
for
miles
and
provided
an
eventless
horizon
a
bright
and
pleasant
enough
sight
indeed
but
nothing
for
joe
foster
well
let
me
by
he
said
and
we
get
along
to
my
own
room
the
resonant
bigness
of
the
gallery
was
far
removed
from
the
intimate
and
the
sociable
to
the
side
of
this
bare
place
with
its
canvases
which
had
become
rather
démodé
or
at
least
had
long
ceased
to
interest
lay
two
foster
own
and
one
adjoining
which
was
classed
as
a
spare
room
it
was
sometimes
given
over
to
visiting
luminaries
of
lesser
magnitudes
real
celebrities
those
of
national
or
international
fame
were
entertained
in
a
sumptuous
suite
on
the
floor
below
casual
young
bachelors
who
sometimes
happened
along
were
lodged
above
and
were
expected
to
adjust
themselves
as
regarded
the
bathroom
to
the
use
and
wont
of
the
occupant
adjoining
foster
own
room
was
a
cramped
omnium
gatherum
cluttered
with
the
paraphernalia
of
daily
living
it
was
somewhat
disordered
and
untidy
the
chamber
of
a
man
who
could
never
see
clearly
how
things
were
or
be
completely
sure
just
what
he
was
about
there
pepys
up
there
he
said
pointing
to
his
bookshelf
as
he
worked
out
of
his
chair
and
tried
to
dispose
himself
comfortably
on
a
couch
i
hope
we
going
to
get
along
a
little
farther
with
him
some
time
as
to
that
i
been
getting
along
a
little
farther
i
been
to
the
library
looking
somewhat
ahead
in
the
completer
edition
i
find
that
who
flung
his
cloak
over
his
shoulder
a
ruffian
and
got
his
ears
boxed
for
it
was
no
mere
temporary
but
lived
on
with
pepys
for
years
and
became
the
most
intimate
and
trusted
of
his
friends
and
who
lasted
three
days
you
remember
as
pepys
maid
turns
up
a
year
or
two
later
as
an
actress
at
duke
house
and
that
other
maid
whose
name
we
have
noted
farther
along
well
there
a
deal
more
about
her
than
exactly
tends
to
edification
good
i
hope
we
shall
have
some
more
of
it
pretty
soon
not
exactly
i
got
some
other
things
to
think
about
such
as
well
i
expect
you
going
to
be
invited
here
to
dinner
pretty
soon
so
i
been
invited
here
to
dinner
before
this
but
another
day
has
come
a
new
light
has
risen
i
have
seen
it
but
i
heard
it
i
heard
it
sing
a
light
singing
are
you
getting
mixed
oh
i
do
know
there
was
and
the
of
notre
dame
they
took
him
there
as
a
child
for
a
choral
service
and
he
thought
it
was
the
rose
itself
that
sang
and
there
was
petrarch
and
the
young
milton
both
talking
about
tears
and
something
of
the
same
sort
in
blessed
damosel
and
a
psychological
catch
for
which
there
ought
to
be
a
name
perhaps
there
a
name
well
as
i
say
the
light
rose
shone
and
sang
i
did
see
it
i
never
see
anybody
but
his
voice
came
up
here
quite
distinctly
it
seemed
good
to
have
a
man
in
the
house
those
everlasting
girls
i
hope
he
was
bothering
to
sing
for
he
probably
was
how
did
it
go
very
well
indeed
what
kind
of
voice
oh
baritone
i
suppose
you
call
it
and
he
sang
sentimental
rubbish
not
at
all
really
good
things
with
passion
well
hardly
with
cool
correctness
an
icicle
on
diana
temple
that
would
be
my
guess
an
icicle
no
wonder
the
young
ladies
do
quite
fancy
him
i
understand
he
took
them
all
in
a
lump
so
far
as
he
took
them
at
all
treated
them
all
exactly
alike
hortense
was
quite
scornful
when
she
brought
up
my
of
course
that
no
way
for
a
man
to
do
on
the
contrary
for
certain
purposes
it
might
be
a
very
good
way
the
contrary
if
you
like
since
frost
may
perform
the
effects
of
fire
medora
herself
is
beginning
to
see
him
as
a
tall
white
candle
burning
in
some
niche
or
at
some
shrine
sir
galahad
or
something
of
that
sort
randolph
grimaced
at
this
oh
misery
i
hope
she
has
mentioned
her
impression
to
imagine
whether
a
man
would
enjoy
being
told
a
thing
like
that
i
hope
i
sure
that
no
dame
sans
merci
will
get
on
his
tracks
if
he
goes
in
too
much
for
loitering
he
may
be
snatched
poor
fellow
they
better
leave
him
to
his
studies
and
his
students
he
has
his
own
way
to
make
i
presume
and
will
need
all
his
energies
to
get
ahead
for
as
some
one
has
said
are
no
on
the
road
to
parnassus
neither
do
boost
a
man
toward
the
porch
or
academe
he
going
in
for
teas
i
wo
say
that
but
it
was
at
a
tea
that
i
met
him
a
trigonometry
tea
at
little
mrs
ryder
you
seen
him
then
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
what
he
like
oh
he
has
points
in
his
favor
he
has
looks
a
trim
figure
even
if
spare
shoulders
and
manners
with
a
breezy
original
tang
the
kind
of
young
fellow
that
people
are
likely
enough
to
like
what
kind
of
manners
did
he
have
for
you
well
there
you
rather
get
me
he
called
me
with
a
touch
of
deference
yet
somehow
i
felt
as
if
i
were
standing
too
close
to
an
electric
fan
yes
even
when
they
indulge
a
show
of
deference
they
contrive
to
blow
our
gray
hairs
about
our
wrinkled
temples
do
talk
about
gray
hairs
you
have
none
and
mine
are
not
always
seen
at
first
glance
medora
begins
to
tax
me
with
a
few
do
you
see
any
not
one
i
concentrate
on
my
own
tush
you
only
or
or
or
foster
adjusted
his
green
shade
and
attempted
an
easier
disposition
of
his
twisted
limbs
on
the
couch
well
as
you
suggest
as
you
insist
how
old
is
this
young
fellow
or
well
they
can
make
us
seem
either
younger
or
older
that
rests
with
ourselves
it
all
in
how
we
take
them
i
expect
better
take
them
so
as
to
make
ourselves
younger
then
the
other
question
how
they
take
us
yes
we
lucky
in
this
day
and
generation
if
they
take
us
at
all
you
may
be
right
assented
randolph
ruefully
yet
there
are
gleams
of
hope
the
more
thoughtful
among
them
have
a
kind
of
condescending
pity
to
bestow
and
the
thoughtless
they
can
find
uses
for
us
one
of
the
faculty
was
telling
me
how
he
tried
to
give
two
or
three
of
his
juniors
an
outing
at
his
cottage
over
in
michigan
everything
he
gave
they
took
for
granted
and
if
anything
was
lacking
they
took
exceptions
monopolized
the
boats
ignored
the
sometimes
i
think
that
even
the
thoughtless
are
thoughtful
in
their
own
way
and
use
us
if
we
happen
to
have
lands
and
substance
purely
as
practical
conveniences
i
been
almost
glad
to
think
that
i
possess
none
myself
do
stay
here
and
talk
like
that
this
is
one
of
my
blue
days
i
wish
i
had
brought
a
novelette
sure
you
do
want
to
hear
a
little
more
about
the
countess
of
castlemaine
and
the
rascalities
of
the
navy
office
no
some
other
time
when
i
feel
a
bit
more
robust
it
is
every
day
that
the
mind
can
digest
such
a
period
with
comfort
are
we
two
old
fogies
beginning
to
wear
on
each
other
i
hope
not
but
when
you
go
down
stop
for
medora
a
minute
and
see
if
she
has
got
something
to
say
medora
when
he
finally
got
down
stairs
had
she
laid
some
knitting
on
the
table
and
came
out
into
the
hall
no
reading
this
afternoon
i
judge
what
i
heard
or
seemed
to
hear
was
a
broken
flow
of
talk
no
reading
restless
so
i
was
afraid
i
rather
have
one
good
steady
voice
purring
along
for
him
and
then
i
know
he
all
right
carolyn
has
been
too
busy
lately
what
seems
to
have
unsettled
him
oh
i
do
know
young
life
possibly
well
i
asked
and
asked
the
girls
not
to
be
quite
so
gay
and
chattery
in
the
upper
halls
you
ca
keep
girls
quiet
i
do
want
to
not
everywhere
and
at
all
times
i
have
an
idea
that
a
given
number
of
girls
make
more
noise
in
a
house
than
the
same
number
of
young
fellows
i
know
that
they
do
in
and
and
i
believe
it
so
as
between
sororities
and
fraternities
put
a
in
the
main
hall
of
the
house
and
another
in
the
main
hall
of
the
house
and
the
girls
would
run
the
score
above
the
boys
every
time
if
ever
i
build
a
sorority
house
it
will
be
for
the
and
a
statue
of
the
great
goddess
din
herself
shall
stand
just
within
the
entrance
you
discourage
me
i
was
going
to
give
a
dinner
go
ahead
a
few
remarks
from
me
wo
stop
the
course
of
your
hospitality
neither
would
a
few
orations
neither
would
a
few
deliberative
bodies
assembled
for
a
month
of
sessions
with
every
member
talking
from
nine
till
six
you
think
i
indulge
in
too
many
too
many
what
festivals
puns
medora
paused
a
bit
puzzled
puns
why
i
never
never
oh
i
see
too
many
dinners
no
who
could
this
one
was
to
be
a
young
people
dinner
i
was
going
to
invite
you
thanks
thanks
thanks
still
if
you
think
my
girls
are
noisy
i
was
speaking
of
girls
in
numbers
well
bertram
cope
did
find
them
so
why
not
why
not
indeed
they
collected
in
a
silent
little
group
behind
my
sofa
puzzled
awed
fudge
well
save
thursday
is
he
coming
i
trust
so
then
they
do
need
a
constabulary
to
keep
them
quiet
oh
hush
how
many
are
you
expecting
to
have
you
know
i
do
enjoy
large
parties
could
you
stand
ten
i
think
so
thursday
then
she
said
with
a
definitive
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
door
randolph
went
down
the
front
walk
with
a
slight
stir
of
elation
a
feeling
that
had
come
to
be
an
infrequent
visitor
enough
he
hoped
that
the
company
would
be
not
only
predominantly
youthful
but
exclusively
so
aside
from
the
hostess
and
himself
and
even
she
often
had
her
young
days
and
her
young
spots
it
would
doubtless
be
clamorous
yet
clamor
understood
and
prepared
for
might
be
met
with
composure
dines
and
tells
about
cope
pushed
away
the
last
of
the
themes
and
put
the
cork
back
in
the
bottle
here
was
a
witless
girl
who
seemed
to
think
that
herrick
and
cowper
were
contemporaries
the
last
sense
to
develop
in
the
western
void
was
apparently
the
sense
of
chronology
unless
indeed
it
were
a
sense
for
the
shades
of
difference
which
served
to
distinguish
between
one
age
and
another
and
provided
the
raw
material
that
made
chronology
a
matter
of
consequence
at
all
if
there
were
only
one
more
muttered
cope
looking
at
the
pile
of
sheets
under
the
i
should
probably
learn
that
chaucer
derived
from
beaumont
and
fletcher
he
reached
up
and
jerked
the
to
a
different
angle
the
flame
lit
through
its
nicked
globe
a
bedroom
cramped
in
size
and
meagre
in
furnishings
a
narrow
bed
dressed
to
look
like
a
lounge
two
oak
chairs
not
lately
varnished
a
bookshelf
overhead
with
some
dozen
of
the
more
indispensable
aids
to
our
literature
the
table
at
which
he
sat
was
one
of
plain
deal
covered
with
some
fabric
which
showed
here
and
there
inkspots
that
antedated
his
own
pen
he
threw
up
this
covering
as
it
fell
over
the
front
edge
of
the
table
pulled
out
a
drawer
laid
a
sheet
of
paper
in
the
bettered
light
and
uncorked
a
bottle
dear
arthur
he
began
he
looked
across
to
the
other
chair
with
its
broken
spindles
and
obfuscated
varnish
with
things
as
he
wanted
them
his
correspondent
would
be
sitting
there
and
would
be
unnecessary
dear
arthur
he
repeated
aloud
and
set
himself
to
a
general
sketch
of
the
new
land
and
the
lay
of
it
of
them
are
of
course
girls
he
presently
found
himself
writing
which
is
the
common
proportion
almost
everywhere
i
presume
except
in
engineering
and
dentistry
however
there
are
four
or
five
men
i
been
pretty
careful
and
they
still
treat
me
with
respect
i
afraid
my
course
is
regarded
as
a
everybody
it
seems
can
grasp
english
literature
and
produce
it
and
almost
anybody
i
begin
to
fear
can
teach
it
judging
that
is
from
the
pay
i
afraid
the
good
folks
at
freeford
will
find
themselves
pinched
for
another
year
still
he
glanced
across
toward
the
pile
of
corrected
themes
he
felt
that
not
everybody
was
called
as
a
matter
of
course
to
write
english
and
he
stubbornly
nourished
the
belief
that
toiling
over
others
imperfections
was
more
of
a
job
than
boards
of
trustees
always
realized
of
course
he
presently
resumed
things
are
rather
changed
from
what
they
were
before
i
find
more
in
the
way
of
social
opportunities
and
greater
interest
shown
by
the
it
is
no
disadvantage
to
cultivate
people
who
have
their
own
homes
the
round
the
are
numerous
enough
but
not
so
good
as
they
might
be
and
i
do
know
but
that
an
instructor
may
lose
caste
by
eating
among
a
miscellany
of
undergraduates
anyhow
it
no
plan
to
pursue
for
long
he
sat
for
a
moment
lost
in
thought
over
recent
social
experiences
one
very
good
house
has
lately
been
opened
to
me
he
continued
i
dined
there
last
thursday
evening
it
really
quite
a
mansion
a
great
many
large
rooms
ballroom
and
all
that
and
the
dinner
itself
was
very
handsomely
done
you
know
my
theory
a
theory
rather
forced
upon
me
in
truth
by
circumstances
that
the
best
way
to
enjoy
a
good
meal
is
to
have
had
a
string
of
poor
ones
well
since
coming
back
and
with
no
permanent
arrangements
made
i
have
had
plenty
of
chance
for
getting
into
position
to
appreciate
the
really
there
was
a
in
pale
pink
ribbons
of
that
color
pink
icing
on
the
cakes
and
so
on
the
same
thing
could
be
done
and
done
charmingly
in
light
green
with
pistache
of
course
the
were
pink
too
his
eye
wandered
toward
a
small
triangular
closet
made
off
from
the
room
by
a
flimsy
and
faded
curtain
i
had
my
cleaned
and
pressed
but
the
lapels
of
the
coat
came
out
rather
shiny
and
i
thought
it
better
to
hire
one
for
the
occasion
there
was
no
trouble
about
a
fit
i
have
standardized
shoulders
as
you
know
of
course
i
miss
you
all
the
time
and
i
assuredly
missed
you
just
here
if
it
is
really
true
as
you
write
that
you
are
holding
your
summer
gains
and
weigh
twelve
pounds
more
than
you
did
at
the
end
of
june
and
if
you
are
thinking
of
getting
a
new
suit
please
bear
in
mind
that
my
own
wo
last
much
longer
i
have
the
chance
now
to
go
out
a
good
deal
and
to
meet
influential
people
in
the
circumstances
i
ask
you
not
to
bant
one
rather
spare
man
in
a
pair
of
men
is
enough
my
hostess
a
phillips
i
met
at
a
tea
during
my
first
week
this
tea
was
given
by
a
lady
in
the
mathematical
department
and
she
and
her
husband
were
at
the
dinner
they
are
people
in
the
early
or
middle
thirties
i
judge
and
were
probably
put
in
as
a
connecting
link
between
the
two
sections
of
the
party
phillips
herself
is
a
rich
widow
of
or
six
possibly
though
i
am
not
the
very
best
judge
in
such
matters
no
need
to
tell
you
that
on
such
a
point
my
eye
and
my
general
sense
are
none
too
acute
the
only
other
or
elderly
person
present
was
a
randolph
who
is
perhaps
fifty
or
a
little
beyond
yet
who
appears
to
have
his
younger
moments
there
were
some
girls
and
there
were
two
young
men
in
business
in
the
city
neighbors
and
not
connected
with
the
university
at
all
which
relief
since
it
a
bit
benumbing
to
move
in
academic
circles
exclusively
i
should
hate
to
feel
that
a
really
professorial
manner
was
stealing
over
me
well
everybody
was
lively
and
gay
except
at
first
ryder
he
the
math
man
but
even
he
limbered
up
finally
phillips
herself
has
a
great
deal
of
action
and
vivacity
seemed
hardly
more
than
thirty
well
i
could
be
pretty
gay
too
with
a
lot
of
money
behind
me
and
i
think
that
for
another
year
or
so
i
can
contrive
to
be
gay
without
it
but
after
that
i
wish
you
had
been
there
instead
of
ryder
if
you
are
really
going
to
be
in
november
as
i
figure
it
you
might
yourself
have
served
as
a
connecting
link
between
youth
and
age
no
no
i
take
it
back
i
did
mean
it
i
would
have
you
seem
older
for
anything
and
you
know
it
there
were
three
girls
they
all
live
in
the
house
itself
forming
a
little
court
seems
to
need
young
life
and
young
attentions
so
not
one
of
them
had
to
be
taken
home
there
usually
to
do
you
know
not
that
it
would
have
mattered
much
as
the
distances
would
have
been
short
and
the
night
was
clear
starlight
but
they
could
all
stay
where
they
were
and
i
walked
home
in
quite
different
company
cope
threw
back
his
oriental
once
more
and
drew
out
a
few
additional
sheets
of
paper
one
of
them
is
an
artist
she
paints
portraits
and
possibly
other
things
oh
i
was
going
to
say
there
is
an
at
the
top
of
the
house
her
husband
i
mean
phillips
was
a
painter
and
collector
himself
and
after
dinner
we
went
up
there
and
a
curious
man
came
in
propelling
a
wheeled
chair
a
sort
of
at
the
feast
but
do
let
me
get
too
far
away
from
the
matter
in
hand
she
is
dark
and
a
bit
tonguey
the
and
i
believe
she
would
be
sarcastic
and
witty
if
she
were
held
down
pretty
well
i
think
she
a
niece
the
relationship
leaves
her
free
as
i
suppose
she
feels
to
express
herself
if
you
like
the
type
you
may
have
it
but
wit
in
a
woman
or
even
humor
always
makes
me
uncomfortable
the
feminine
idea
of
either
is
a
little
different
from
ours
another
girl
is
a
musician
she
plays
the
violin
quite
tolerably
yes
yes
i
recall
your
views
about
it
either
good
or
bad
nothing
between
i
say
this
then
she
played
some
simple
and
unpretentious
things
and
did
them
very
deftly
simple
unpretentious
oddest
thing
in
the
world
for
she
is
a
recent
graduate
of
our
school
of
music
and
began
this
fall
as
an
instructor
would
you
have
expected
to
find
her
demanding
a
chance
to
perform
a
sonata
at
the
least
or
pining
miserably
for
a
concerto
with
full
orchestra
well
this
young
lady
i
put
down
as
a
plain
boarder
you
ca
maintain
a
big
house
on
memories
and
a
collection
of
paintings
she
a
nice
child
and
i
dare
say
makes
as
good
a
boarder
as
any
nice
child
could
the
third
girl
if
you
want
to
hear
any
more
about
them
seems
to
be
a
secretary
think
of
having
the
run
of
a
house
where
a
social
secretary
is
required
i
sure
she
sends
out
the
invitations
and
keeps
the
besides
all
that
she
writes
poetry
she
is
the
minstrel
of
the
court
she
does
verses
about
her
chatelaine
is
quite
the
mistress
of
adulation
would
know
the
difference
between
herrick
and
cowper
cope
pulled
out
his
watch
then
he
resumed
it
half
past
ten
but
i
think
i
run
on
for
a
few
moments
longer
if
i
do
finish
i
can
wind
up
mr
randolph
sat
opposite
me
he
looked
at
me
a
lot
and
gave
attention
to
whatever
i
said
whether
said
to
him
or
to
my
neighbors
right
and
left
or
to
the
whole
table
i
did
feel
him
especially
clever
but
easy
and
pleasant
and
friendly
also
a
little
shy
even
after
we
had
gone
up
to
the
i
afraid
that
made
me
more
talkative
than
ever
you
know
how
shyness
in
another
man
makes
me
all
the
more
confident
and
rackety
be
sure
that
voice
of
mine
rang
out
but
not
in
song
there
was
a
piano
up
stairs
of
course
and
that
led
to
a
little
dancing
different
people
took
turns
in
playing
i
danced
once
with
each
of
the
three
girls
and
twice
with
my
hostess
then
i
let
ryder
and
the
two
young
do
the
rest
randolph
danced
once
with
phillips
and
that
ended
it
for
him
my
own
dancing
as
you
know
is
nothing
to
brag
of
i
think
the
young
ladies
were
quite
satisfied
with
the
little
i
did
i
sure
was
you
also
know
my
views
on
round
dances
why
dancing
should
be
done
exclusively
by
couples
arranged
strictly
on
the
basis
of
contrasted
sexes
i
think
of
the
good
old
days
of
the
renaissance
in
italy
when
women
if
they
wanted
to
dance
just
got
up
and
danced
alone
or
if
they
did
want
to
dance
alone
danced
together
i
like
to
see
soldiers
or
sailors
dance
in
pairs
as
a
straightforward
outlet
for
superfluous
physical
energy
also
peasants
in
a
ring
about
a
maypole
or
something
also
i
very
much
like
square
dances
and
reels
there
were
enough
that
night
for
a
quadrille
with
somebody
for
the
piano
and
even
somebody
to
off
but
whoever
sees
a
quadrille
in
these
days
however
i
must
burn
any
more
gas
on
this
topic
i
sat
out
several
dances
between
phillips
and
randolph
he
thought
he
had
done
enough
for
her
and
she
thought
i
had
done
enough
for
them
all
and
one
of
the
young
did
enough
for
that
springy
ryder
once
indeed
phillips
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
try
a
third
dance
with
her
she
goes
at
it
with
a
good
deal
of
vivacity
and
vim
but
i
told
her
she
must
know
by
this
time
that
i
was
something
of
a
bungler
would
quite
say
that
she
returned
smiling
but
we
continued
to
sit
there
side
by
side
on
a
sort
of
bench
built
against
the
wall
and
she
seemed
as
well
pleased
to
have
it
that
way
as
the
other
she
did
however
speak
about
a
little
singing
i
told
her
that
she
must
have
found
me
something
of
a
bungler
there
too
and
reminded
her
that
i
could
play
the
accompaniments
of
my
best
songs
at
all
arthur
my
dear
boy
i
depend
on
for
that
and
you
must
come
down
here
and
do
it
no
singing
then
but
phillips
was
not
quite
satisfied
would
i
recite
something
heavens
well
of
course
i
know
lots
of
poems
mon
i
repeated
one
then
other
volunteers
were
called
upon
it
was
entertaining
with
a
vengeance
the
young
ladies
had
to
chip
in
also
though
they
of
course
were
prepared
to
and
one
of
the
young
did
some
clever
juggling
and
ryder
sang
a
little
french
ballade
and
randolph
poor
man
was
suddenly
routed
out
of
his
placidity
and
responded
as
well
as
he
could
with
one
or
two
little
stories
not
very
pointed
and
not
very
well
told
but
i
judge
he
makes
no
great
claim
to
being
a
he
was
merely
paying
an
unexpected
tax
as
gracefully
as
he
could
well
as
i
was
saying
the
man
in
the
wheeled
chair
came
in
of
course
he
had
been
down
to
dinner
i
think
i
saw
a
tray
for
him
carried
along
the
hall
as
he
was
working
his
way
through
the
door
i
suppose
i
must
have
been
talking
and
laughing
at
my
loudest
and
that
big
bare
room
done
in
hard
wood
made
me
seem
noisier
still
he
sort
of
stopped
and
twitched
and
appeared
to
shrink
back
in
his
chair
i
presume
my
tones
went
straight
through
the
poor
twisted
invalid
head
he
must
have
fancied
me
from
the
racket
i
was
making
as
a
sort
of
hercules
which
is
not
quite
the
case
if
not
as
the
whole
football
squad
rolled
into
one
whether
he
really
saw
me
then
or
thereafter
i
do
know
he
wore
a
sort
of
green
shade
over
his
eyes
of
course
i
met
him
in
due
form
i
tried
not
to
give
his
poor
hand
too
much
of
a
wring
another
of
my
bad
habits
but
he
took
all
i
gave
and
even
seemed
to
hang
on
for
a
little
more
he
sat
quietly
to
one
side
for
a
while
and
i
tried
not
to
act
the
bull
of
bashan
again
anyhow
he
did
start
a
second
time
presently
he
pulled
out
rather
unceremoniously
the
two
young
had
begun
a
sort
of
burlesque
fandango
and
their
feet
were
pretty
noisy
on
the
bare
floor
he
started
off
after
looking
toward
the
piano
and
then
toward
me
and
phillips
glanced
about
as
if
to
hint
that
any
display
of
surprise
or
of
indulgence
would
be
misplaced
poor
chap
well
i
glad
he
did
see
me
dancing
we
broke
up
about
eleven
and
randolph
suggested
that
as
we
lived
in
the
same
general
direction
we
might
walk
homeward
together
great
heaven
it
eleven
and
five
after
now
enough
in
all
conscience
for
you
shall
have
the
rest
under
an
evening
or
two
later
cope
again
corked
his
red
ink
and
uncorked
his
black
as
i
have
said
randolph
and
i
walked
home
together
he
stopped
for
a
moment
in
front
of
his
place
another
large
handsome
house
he
told
me
he
had
the
use
of
his
quarters
as
long
as
his
landlord
lease
ran
and
asked
me
to
come
round
some
time
and
see
how
he
was
fixed
then
he
said
suddenly
that
the
evening
was
fine
and
the
night
young
and
that
he
would
walk
on
with
me
to
quarters
if
i
did
mind
of
course
i
did
he
seemed
so
friendly
and
pleasant
but
i
let
him
learn
for
himself
that
i
was
far
from
being
lodged
in
any
architectural
monument
well
we
went
on
for
the
necessary
ten
minutes
and
he
seem
at
all
put
out
by
the
mediocre
aspect
of
the
house
where
i
have
put
up
he
sort
of
took
it
all
for
granted
as
if
he
knew
about
it
already
in
fact
on
the
way
from
his
place
to
mine
i
no
more
led
him
as
i
sense
it
now
than
he
led
me
he
hesitated
at
no
corner
or
crossing
am
an
old
churchtonian
he
said
incidentally
as
if
he
knew
everything
and
everybody
he
also
mentioned
just
as
incidentally
that
he
had
a
on
our
board
of
trustees
of
course
i
promised
to
go
round
and
see
him
i
presume
that
i
shall
drop
in
on
him
some
time
or
other
come
down
here
and
you
shall
have
one
more
house
of
call
he
stopped
for
a
moment
in
front
of
my
diggings
taking
my
hand
to
say
goodnight
and
taking
his
own
time
in
dropping
it
enough
is
enough
have
the
small
change
needed
for
paying
your
way
through
society
he
said
with
a
sort
of
smile
must
cultivate
a
few
little
arts
myself
he
went
on
seem
necessary
in
some
houses
but
i
glad
after
all
that
i
did
remember
that
a
tribute
was
likely
to
be
levied
it
would
have
taken
away
my
appetite
and
have
made
the
whole
evening
a
misery
in
advance
as
things
went
i
had
on
the
whole
a
pleasant
time
only
i
understood
that
you
sang
and
i
was
rather
hoping
to
hear
you
do
best
with
my
regular
accompanist
i
returned
meaning
you
of
course
i
hope
you
do
mind
being
degraded
to
that
level
your
regular
accompanist
is
not
not
miles
away
i
replied
hundred
and
fifty
of
them
i
might
have
added
if
i
had
chosen
to
be
specific
now
if
he
had
wanted
to
hear
me
why
had
he
asked
he
would
have
needed
only
to
second
phillips
herself
and
there
he
was
just
on
the
other
side
of
me
in
consequence
of
his
reticence
i
was
driven
or
drove
myself
to
blank
verse
and
that
other
man
the
one
in
the
chair
he
may
have
had
his
expectations
too
arthur
arthur
try
to
grasp
the
situation
you
must
come
down
here
and
you
must
bring
your
hands
with
you
tell
the
bishop
and
the
precentor
that
you
are
needed
elsewhere
they
will
let
you
off
of
course
i
know
that
a
village
choir
needs
every
tenor
it
can
get
and
keep
but
come
if
they
insist
leave
your
voice
behind
but
do
bring
your
hands
and
your
reading
eye
do
let
me
go
along
making
my
new
circle
think
i
an
utter
dub
tell
your
father
plainly
that
he
can
never
in
the
world
make
a
out
of
you
force
him
to
listen
to
reason
what
is
one
year
spent
in
finding
out
just
what
you
are
fit
for
come
along
i
miss
you
like
the
devil
nobody
does
my
things
as
sympathetically
as
you
do
give
up
your
old
anthems
and
your
old
tinware
and
tenpennies
and
come
along
i
can
bolt
from
this
hole
at
a
week
notice
and
we
can
go
into
quarters
together
a
real
bed
instead
of
an
upholstered
shelf
and
a
closet
big
enough
for
two
wardrobes
if
mine
really
deserves
the
name
we
could
get
our
own
breakfast
and
you
could
take
a
course
in
something
or
other
till
you
found
out
just
what
the
big
town
could
do
for
you
in
any
event
you
would
be
bearing
me
company
and
your
company
is
what
i
need
so
pack
up
and
appear
the
delay
in
the
posting
of
this
appeal
soon
brought
from
winnebago
a
letter
outside
the
usual
course
of
correspondence
it
was
on
a
fresh
sheet
and
under
a
new
that
cope
continued
after
a
page
of
generalities
and
of
attention
to
particular
points
in
the
letter
from
wisconsin
cope
took
up
his
own
line
of
thought
i
had
meant
of
course
to
look
in
on
him
within
a
few
days
no
great
hurry
about
it
but
on
sunday
evening
he
wrote
and
asked
if
he
might
not
call
round
on
me
instead
my
name
is
not
in
the
neither
as
i
found
out
was
his
so
i
used
up
a
sheet
of
paper
an
envelope
and
a
stamp
just
such
as
i
am
now
using
on
you
to
tell
him
that
he
might
indeed
i
put
in
the
for
cordiality
hoping
he
would
think
i
had
slighted
invitation
on
monday
evening
he
came
round
i
must
have
reached
him
by
the
late
afternoon
delivery
need
i
say
that
he
had
to
take
this
poor
place
as
he
found
it
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
no
tendency
to
inventory
or
appraise
he
sat
down
beside
me
on
the
couch
just
as
if
he
had
no
notion
that
it
was
a
bed
and
a
rather
rocky
one
at
that
and
talked
about
my
row
of
books
and
about
music
and
plays
and
about
his
own
collection
of
curios
all
in
a
quiet
contained
way
yet
intent
on
me
if
not
on
my
outfit
well
it
pleasant
to
be
considered
for
what
you
are
rather
than
for
what
you
have
or
for
what
few
poor
sticks
your
landlady
may
have
and
i
rather
liked
his
being
here
certainly
he
was
a
change
from
my
students
who
sometimes
seem
to
exclude
better
timber
needless
to
say
he
repeated
his
invitation
and
last
evening
i
shunted
middle
english
in
which
i
have
a
lot
to
catch
up
and
walked
round
to
him
very
adequately
and
handsomely
lodged
really
good
bachelor
quarters
i
had
known
for
certain
whether
he
was
married
or
not
a
stockbroker
of
a
sort
i
hear
but
not
enough
to
hurt
i
should
guess
he
has
a
library
and
a
like
me
he
sleeps
but
he
does
have
to
sit
on
his
bed
in
the
daytime
and
he
has
a
bathrobe
of
just
the
sort
i
shall
have
when
i
can
afford
it
he
has
got
together
a
lot
of
and
curios
but
takes
them
lightly
i
only
one
big
he
said
handing
me
his
and
settling
me
down
in
comfort
i
entertain
very
seldom
i
should
like
to
be
hospitable
he
went
on
i
really
think
it
in
me
but
that
pretty
much
out
of
the
question
here
i
have
no
chef
no
of
my
own
no
certainly
perhaps
before
very
long
i
shall
have
to
make
a
change
he
asked
me
about
freeford
and
i
did
realize
until
i
was
on
my
way
back
that
he
had
assumed
my
home
town
just
as
he
had
assumed
my
lodging
well
all
right
i
never
resent
a
friendly
interest
he
sat
in
a
chair
and
blew
his
and
wondered
if
i
had
been
a
boy
one
too
he
said
at
least
churchton
forty
years
at
least
churchton
thirty
years
ago
was
not
all
it
is
it
has
always
had
its
own
special
tone
of
course
but
in
my
young
in
my
younger
days
it
was
just
a
large
country
village
fewer
of
us
went
into
town
to
make
money
or
to
spend
and
then
he
asked
me
to
go
into
town
one
evening
soon
and
help
him
spend
some
he
suggested
it
rather
shyly
i
will
say
though
french
is
not
my
business
he
offered
a
dinner
at
a
restaurant
and
the
theatre
afterwards
did
i
accept
indeed
i
did
think
arthur
after
all
the
movies
and
restaurants
round
the
elms
and
the
fountain
tho
you
do
know
them
yet
i
will
say
too
that
his
cigarettes
were
rather
better
than
my
own
i
suppose
he
is
fully
fifty
but
he
has
his
young
days
i
can
see
certainly
his
age
does
obtrude
does
bother
me
at
all
though
he
sometimes
seems
conscious
of
it
himself
he
wears
part
of
the
time
for
dignity
i
presume
he
had
them
on
when
i
came
in
but
they
disappeared
almost
at
once
and
i
saw
them
no
more
he
asked
me
about
my
degree
though
i
did
remember
having
spoken
of
it
i
could
but
mention
as
the
word
goes
and
you
know
that
when
i
mention
him
it
always
makes
the
other
man
mention
bacon
he
did
mention
bacon
and
smiled
studied
the
cipher
he
said
you
need
to
make
it
go
is
a
pair
of
texts
a
long
one
and
a
short
one
and
two
fonts
of
type
or
their
equivalent
in
penmanship
two
colors
of
ink
for
example
you
can
put
anything
into
anything
see
here
he
reached
up
to
a
shelf
and
brought
down
a
thin
brown
square
the
alphabet
he
said
here
opening
a
little
beyond
my
use
of
it
one
of
my
earliest
exercises
i
have
put
the
first
stanza
of
annabel
lee
into
the
second
chapter
of
tom
jones
he
ignored
the
absent
and
picked
out
the
red
letters
from
the
black
with
perfect
ease
thing
in
the
world
he
went
on
can
do
it
all
it
needs
is
time
and
patience
and
care
and
if
you
happen
to
be
waggishly
or
fraudulently
inclined
you
can
give
yourself
considerable
entertainment
and
can
entertain
or
puzzle
other
people
later
you
do
really
believe
that
bacon
wrote
shakespeare
of
course
i
do
arthur
as
you
very
well
know
i
picked
out
the
first
line
of
lee
by
arranging
the
necessary
groupings
among
the
odd
mixture
of
black
and
red
letters
he
exhibited
and
told
him
i
did
believe
that
bacon
wrote
shakespeare
nor
that
shakespeare
did
either
did
then
he
naturally
asked
i
told
him
that
i
would
grant
at
the
start
and
for
a
few
seasons
a
group
of
young
noblemen
and
young
gentlemen
but
that
some
one
of
them
supposing
there
to
have
been
more
than
that
one
soon
distanced
all
the
rest
and
presently
became
the
edifice
before
which
the
manager
from
stratford
was
only
the
facade
he
this
was
a
noble
and
a
man
of
wide
reach
both
in
his
natural
endowments
and
in
his
acquired
culture
but
he
could
dip
openly
into
the
london
cesspool
he
had
his
own
quality
to
safeguard
against
the
contamination
of
a
new
and
none
too
trade
do
care
for
your
shillings
he
said
to
shaxper
for
the
printed
plays
afterward
but
i
do
value
your
front
and
your
footing
and
the
services
they
can
render
me
on
my
way
to
he
was
an
earl
or
something
such
with
a
in
warwick
or
on
the
borders
of
gloucestershire
if
i
only
had
a
year
and
the
money
to
make
a
journey
among
the
of
i
said
to
dig
for
a
while
in
their
well
you
get
the
idea
all
right
enough
he
came
across
and
sat
on
the
arm
of
the
big
you
went
over
there
and
discovered
all
that
the
english
scholars
would
never
forgive
you
as
of
course
they
would
look
at
the
recent
shaxper
discoveries
by
americans
in
london
would
that
be
a
rather
sensational
thesis
he
went
on
a
staid
candidate
for
an
or
a
or
a
or
whatever
it
is
you
after
it
would
of
a
verity
and
why
should
it
be
go
over
there
he
ended
with
a
smile
as
he
dropped
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
friends
would
rather
have
you
here
fear
i
returned
ca
possibly
manage
it
i
shall
just
do
something
on
the
disjunctive
conjunctions
in
lost
and
let
it
go
at
that
he
got
up
to
reach
for
the
tell
me
he
said
a
degree
is
much
in
itself
just
an
on
the
journey
to
a
better
professional
standing
said
i
and
to
better
professional
rewards
it
means
so
many
more
hundreds
of
dollars
a
year
in
pay
but
you
know
all
about
that
too
i
glad
your
dramatic
club
is
getting
forward
so
well
with
the
rehearsals
for
its
first
drive
of
the
season
glad
too
that
this
time
at
least
they
have
given
you
a
good
part
tell
me
all
about
it
before
the
big
stars
in
town
begin
to
dim
your
people
in
my
eyes
and
in
your
own
and
do
let
them
cast
you
for
the
next
performance
in
january
you
will
be
here
by
then
yours
undertakes
an
two
or
three
days
later
randolph
met
medora
phillips
in
front
of
the
bank
this
was
a
neat
and
solemn
little
edifice
opposite
the
elms
and
the
fountain
it
was
neighbored
by
stores
the
offices
of
renting
agencies
and
the
restaurants
where
the
unfraternized
undergraduates
took
their
daily
chances
through
its
door
passed
tradesmen
clerks
with
deposits
and
young
housewives
with
babies
in
perambulators
and
students
with
their
small
financial
problems
and
members
of
the
faculty
about
to
cash
large
or
small
checks
phillips
had
come
across
from
the
store
to
pick
up
her
monthly
sheaf
of
vouchers
it
was
the
third
of
october
do
you
want
to
come
in
for
a
minute
she
asked
randolph
then
you
can
walk
on
with
me
to
the
stationer
carolyn
tells
me
that
our
last
batch
of
invitations
reduced
us
to
nothing
how
did
dinner
go
randolph
followed
her
into
the
cool
marble
interior
oh
in
town
you
mean
quite
well
i
think
i
sure
my
young
man
took
a
good
honest
appetite
with
him
i
know
we
do
do
half
enough
for
these
poor
boys
yes
he
rose
to
the
food
but
not
to
the
drinks
i
took
him
after
all
to
my
club
i
innocently
suggested
cocktails
but
no
he
declined
in
a
deft
but
straightforward
way
country
principles
morals
he
made
me
feel
like
a
well
like
a
corrupter
of
youth
you
did
mind
though
of
course
you
did
you
liked
it
it
noble
was
it
charming
so
glad
that
had
nothing
but
apollinaris
and
birch
beer
still
it
would
have
been
a
pleasure
to
hear
him
refuse
the
gave
her
her
vouchers
she
put
them
in
her
handbag
and
somehow
got
round
a
perambulator
and
the
two
went
out
on
the
street
and
how
did
your
go
she
continued
that
about
as
much
as
we
can
call
the
drama
in
these
days
that
possibly
did
go
quite
so
well
i
took
him
to
a
as
they
nowadays
call
their
mixture
of
farce
and
funniment
i
wish
meredith
could
have
seen
it
well
he
laughed
a
little
here
and
there
obligingly
i
might
say
but
there
was
no
in
the
thing
for
him
nothing
to
fill
his
intellectual
maw
he
a
serious
youngster
after
all
exuberant
as
he
seems
i
felt
him
appraising
me
as
a
gay
old
irresponsible
you
are
not
to
use
that
word
come
do
say
that
he
that
he
venerated
you
oh
not
at
all
during
the
six
hours
we
were
together
train
club
theatre
and
train
again
he
never
once
called
me
he
never
once
employed
our
clumsy
repellent
mode
of
address
in
fact
he
never
employed
any
mode
of
address
at
all
he
got
round
it
quite
cleverly
on
system
as
i
soon
began
to
perceive
and
not
for
a
moment
did
he
forget
that
the
system
was
in
operation
he
used
straight
through
a
sort
of
generalized
manner
i
might
have
been
anywhere
between
twenty
and
they
were
now
in
front
of
the
stationer
and
there
were
few
people
in
the
quiet
thoroughfare
to
jostle
them
medora
smiled
how
clever
how
charming
she
said
leaving
you
altogether
free
to
pick
your
own
age
i
hope
you
did
go
beyond
you
must
have
been
quite
charming
in
your
early
thirties
that
kind
of
you
i
sure
but
i
do
believe
that
i
was
ever
at
age
i
think
you
used
that
word
once
too
often
i
was
a
quiet
studious
lad
with
nice
notions
but
possibly
something
of
a
prig
i
was
less
than
correct
the
young
ladies
had
the
greatest
confidence
in
me
not
one
of
them
was
ever
why
how
horrid
how
utterly
unsatisfactory
nor
their
mothers
no
and
i
still
single
as
you
advised
and
i
not
sure
that
the
young
gentlemen
cared
much
more
for
me
if
i
had
had
a
little
more
and
i
might
have
equalled
the
particular
young
gentleman
of
whom
we
have
been
discoursing
but
his
obviously
artificial
style
of
speech
concealed
as
she
guessed
some
real
feeling
oh
if
you
insist
on
disparaging
yourself
i
was
quite
as
coolly
correct
as
i
apprehend
him
to
be
and
if
i
could
only
have
contrived
to
compass
the
charming
as
well
who
knows
what
you
do
like
my
word
is
there
a
better
a
more
suitable
no
you
have
the
he
threw
a
finger
through
the
wide
pane
of
glass
is
that
the
sort
of
thing
you
are
after
those
boxes
of
pale
gray
are
rather
good
i
never
buy
from
the
come
in
and
help
me
choose
i
love
to
shop
he
said
in
a
mock
ecstasy
with
others
he
added
i
like
to
follow
money
in
and
to
contribute
taste
and
experience
over
the
stationer
counter
she
said
save
sunday
we
are
going
out
to
the
thank
you
very
well
most
glad
to
and
you
are
to
bring
him
him
bertram
cope
why
i
given
him
six
hours
within

phillips
had
lately
taken
on
a
house
among
the
sand
dunes
beyond
the
state
line
this
singular
region
had
recently
acquired
so
wide
a
reputation
for
utter
neglect
and
desolation
that
despite
its
distance
from
town
whether
in
miles
or
in
hours
no
one
could
quite
afford
to
ignore
it
picnics
pageants
encampments
and
excursions
all
united
in
proclaiming
its
remoteness
its
silence
its
vacuity
along
the
rim
of
ragged
slopes
which
put
a
term
to
the
hundreds
of
miles
of
water
that
spread
from
the
north
people
tramped
bathed
canoed
motored
and
within
a
few
seasons
duneland
had
acquired
as
great
a
reputation
for
prahlerische
dunkelheit
for
ostentatious
obscurity
as
ever
was
enjoyed
even
by
schiller
wallenstein
lovers
of
nature
and
friends
of
the
landscape
moved
through
its
distant
and
inaccessible
purlieus
in
squads
and
cohorts
everybody
had
to
spend
there
at
least
one
sunday
in
the
summer
season
there
were
enthusiasts
whose
interest
ran
from
march
to
november
there
were
fanatics
who
insisted
on
trips
thitherward
in
january
and
there
were
one
or
two
ranking
ahead
even
of
the
fishermen
and
the
who
clung
to
that
weird
and
changing
region
the
whole
year
through
medora
phillips
house
was
several
miles
beyond
the
worst
of
the
there
were
no
tents
in
sight
even
in
august
nor
was
the
honk
of
the
heard
even
during
the
most
tumultuous
sundays
the
spot
was
harder
to
reach
than
most
others
along
the
twenty
miles
of
nicked
and
ragged
brim
which
helped
enclose
the
wide
blue
area
of
the
big
water
but
was
better
worth
while
when
you
got
there
her
little
tract
lay
beyond
the
more
prosaic
reaches
that
were
furnished
chiefly
in
the
light
green
of
deciduous
trees
it
was
part
of
a
long
stretch
thickly
set
for
miles
with
the
dark
and
sombre
green
of
pines
our
had
taken
the
year
before
a
neglected
and
dilapidated
old
farmhouse
and
had
made
it
into
what
her
friends
and
habitues
liked
to
call
a
bungalow
the
house
had
been
put
up
in
the
rustic
spirit
which
ignores
all
considerations
of
landscape
and
outlook
behind
a
dune
which
allowed
but
the
merest
glimpse
of
the
lake
however
a
walk
of
six
or
eight
minutes
led
down
to
the
beach
and
in
the
late
afternoon
the
sun
came
with
grand
effect
across
the
gilded
water
and
through
the
tall
which
bordered
the
path
medora
had
added
a
sleeping
porch
a
and
a
for
the
car
and
she
entertained
there
through
the
summer
lavishly
even
if
intermittently
and
casually
no
place
in
the
world
like
it
she
would
declare
enthusiastically
to
the
yet
inexperienced
and
therefore
the
still
unconverted
the
spring
arrives
weeks
ahead
of
our
spring
in
town
and
the
fall
lingers
on
for
weeks
after
come
to
our
shore
where
the
fauna
and
flora
of
the
whole
country
meet
in
one
all
the
wild
birds
pass
in
their
migrations
and
the
flowers
then
she
would
expatiate
on
the
trailing
arbutus
in
april
and
the
vast
sheets
of
pale
blue
lupines
in
early
june
and
the
yellow
sunlike
blossoms
of
the
in
july
and
the
red
glories
of
and
bittersweet
and
sumach
in
september
no
wonder
she
would
say
that
they
have
to
distribute
handbills
on
the
asking
people
to
leave
the
flowers
alone
how
shocking
cope
had
cried
with
his
resonant
laugh
when
this
phase
of
the
situation
was
brought
to
his
attention
are
the
automobile
people
any
better
randolph
had
told
him
of
some
of
the
other
drawbacks
involved
in
the
excursion
it
a
long
way
to
go
even
when
you
pass
up
the
trolley
and
make
a
single
big
bolt
by
train
and
it
leads
through
an
industrial
region
that
is
mighty
unprepossessing
little
beauty
until
almost
the
end
and
even
when
you
get
there
it
may
all
seem
a
slight
and
simple
affair
for
the
time
and
trouble
taken
unless
you
really
like
nature
and
lastly
he
said
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
cope
you
may
find
yourself
as
the
day
wears
on
getting
a
little
too
much
of
my
company
oh
i
hope
that
does
mean
returned
cope
with
another
ingenuous
unchaining
of
his
native
resonance
that
you
are
afraid
of
getting
a
little
too
much
of
mine
i
fond
of
novelty
and
nobody
can
frighten
me
if
that
the
case
let
get
away
as
early
in
the
day
as
we
can
breakfasts
of
course
are
late
in
every
household
on
sunday
so
meet
at
the
tavern
at
and
make
a
flying
start
at
eight
sunday
morning
came
clear
and
calm
and
warm
to
the
town
a
belated
september
day
or
possibly
an
early
intimation
of
indian
summer
and
it
promised
to
be
even
more
delightful
in
the
favored
region
toward
which
our
friends
were
journeying
after
they
had
cleared
many
miles
of
foundries
and
railroad
crossings
and
had
paralleled
for
a
last
a
distant
succession
of
sandhills
wooded
or
glistening
white
they
were
set
down
at
a
small
group
of
farmhouses
with
a
varied
walk
of
five
miles
before
them
half
a
mile
through
a
shaded
country
lane
another
along
a
path
that
led
across
low
damp
ground
through
thickets
of
hazel
and
brier
a
third
over
a
light
soil
increasingly
sandy
beneath
oaks
and
lindens
and
pines
which
cloaked
the
outlines
of
the
slopes
ahead
and
finally
a
great
mound
of
pure
sand
that
slanted
up
into
a
blue
sky
and
made
its
own
horizon
we
taken
things
easy
said
randolph
who
had
been
that
way
before
and
i
hope
we
have
enough
breath
left
for
our
job
there
it
lies
right
in
front
of
us
no
favor
asked
here
declared
cope
he
gave
a
sly
sidewise
glance
as
if
to
ask
how
the
other
might
stand
as
to
and
wind
up
we
go
said
randolph
on
the
edge
of
the
adventurer
in
duneland
hardly
knows
as
he
works
his
way
through
one
of
the
infrequent
whether
to
thank
nature
for
her
aid
or
to
tax
her
with
her
cruelty
she
offers
few
other
means
of
reaching
the
water
save
for
these
nicks
in
the
edges
of
the
great
cup
yet
it
is
possible
enough
to
view
her
as
a
careless
and
reckless
handmaiden
busily
devastating
the
cosmical
the
is
a
tragedy
and
the
cause
of
further
tragedy
the
north
winds
in
the
impetus
gathered
through
a
long
unimpeded
flight
over
three
hundred
miles
of
water
ceaselessly
try
and
test
the
sandy
bulwarks
for
a
slightest
opening
the
flaw
once
found
the
work
of
devastation
and
desolation
begins
and
once
begun
it
continues
without
cessation
every
hurricane
cuts
a
wider
and
deeper
gash
fills
the
air
with
clouds
of
loose
sand
and
gives
sinister
addition
to
the
white
shifting
heaps
and
fields
that
steal
slowly
yet
unrelentingly
over
the
green
hinterland
of
forest
which
lies
below
the
southern
slopes
trees
yet
to
die
stand
in
passive
bands
at
their
feet
the
stark
black
trunks
of
trees
long
dead
rise
here
and
there
in
spots
where
the
has
done
its
work
of
ruin
and
passed
on
after
some
moments
of
scrambling
and
panting
our
two
travelers
gained
the
divide
below
them
sloped
a
great
amphitheatre
of
sand
falling
in
irregular
gradations
and
at
the
foot
of
all
lay
the
lake
calmly
azure
with
its
horizon
whether
near
or
far
for
it
was
almost
impossible
to
say
mystically
vague
on
either
hand
rose
other
hills
of
sand
set
with
sparse
pines
and
covered
in
patches
with
growths
of
wild
grape
the
fruit
half
ripened
within
the
amphitheatre
at
various
levels
rose
grimly
a
few
stumps
and
shreds
of
cedars
long
dead
and
long
indifferent
to
the
future
ravages
of
the
enemy
the
whole
scene
was
plausibly
gentle
and
inert
it
was
indeed
a
bridal
of
earth
and
sky
with
the
approval
of
the
blue
deep
and
no
from
any
demon
wind
so
far
so
good
said
randolph
taking
off
his
hat
wiping
his
forehead
and
breathing
just
a
little
harder
than
he
liked
the
rest
of
our
course
is
plain
down
those
slopes
and
then
a
couple
of
miles
along
the
shore
easy
walking
that
a
mere
promenade
on
a
boulevard
cope
stood
on
the
height
and
tossed
his
bare
head
like
a
tireless
young
colt
the
sun
fell
bright
on
his
mane
of
yellow
hair
he
took
in
a
deep
breath
it
good
he
declared
it
great
and
the
water
looks
better
yet
shall
we
make
it
in
a
rush
he
began
to
plunge
down
the
long
broken
each
step
was
worth
ten
randolph
followed
with
judgment
he
would
not
seem
young
enough
to
be
a
competitor
nor
yet
old
enough
to
be
a
drag
on
the
shore
he
wiped
and
panted
a
little
more
but
not
to
the
point
of
embarrassment
and
still
less
to
the
point
of
mortification
after
all
he
was
keeping
up
pretty
well
at
the
bottom
cope
with
his
shoes
full
of
sand
turned
round
and
looked
up
the
slope
down
which
his
companion
was
coming
he
waved
his
arms
it
almost
as
fine
from
here
he
cried
the
beach
once
gained
was
in
sight
both
ways
for
miles
not
a
human
habitation
was
visible
nor
a
human
being
two
or
three
gulls
flew
a
little
out
from
shore
and
the
tracks
of
a
sandpiper
led
from
the
wet
shingle
to
the
first
fringe
of
sandgrass
higher
up
where
are
the
crowds
asked
cope
with
a
sonorous
shout
miles
behind
replied
randolph
we
have
come
this
long
distance
to
meet
them
after
all
besides
he
continued
looking
at
his
watch
this
is
not
the
time
of
day
for
them
at
people
are
not
strolling
or
tramping
they
thinking
of
their
dinner
we
have
a
full
hour
or
more
for
making
less
than
two
easy
miles
before
we
reach
no
need
to
hurry
then
the
beach
at
its
edge
was
firm
and
they
strolled
on
for
half
a
mile
and
cooled
off
as
they
went
the
air
was
mild
the
noonday
sun
was
warm
both
of
them
had
taken
off
their
coats
they
sat
down
under
a
clump
of
basswoods
the
only
trees
beyond
the
foot
of
the
and
looked
at
the
water
it
like
a
big
useless
bathtub
observed
randolph
not
so
much
useless
as
unused
yes
i
suppose
the
season
as
good
as
over
though
this
end
of
the
lake
stays
warm
longer
than
most
other
parts
it
is
so
much
the
warmth
of
the
water
remarked
cope
sententiously
it
more
the
warmth
of
the
air
well
the
air
seems
warm
enough
after
all
the
air
and
the
sun
are
about
the
best
part
of
a
swim
do
you
want
to
go
in
cope
rose
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
water
and
put
in
a
finger
or
two
well
it
might
be
warmer
but
as
i
say
we
could
try
a
dip
that
would
get
us
to
our
dinner
in
good
time
and
in
good
trim
all
right
let
then
only
you
have
to
do
most
of
the
swimming
said
randolph
my
few
small
feats
are
all
accomplished
pretty
close
to
shore
never
mind
company
the
thing
a
fellow
finds
it
rather
slow
going
in
alone
cope
whisked
off
his
clothes
with
incredible
rapidity
and
piled
them
or
flung
them
under
the
basswoods
the
suddenly
resuscitated
technique
of
the
lad
who
could
take
avail
of
any
pond
or
any
quiet
stretch
of
river
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
waded
in
quickly
up
to
his
waist
and
then
took
an
intrepid
header
his
lithe
young
legs
and
arms
threw
themselves
about
hither
and
yon
after
a
moment
or
two
he
got
on
his
feet
and
made
his
way
back
across
a
yard
of
fine
shingle
to
the
sand
itself
he
was
sputtering
and
gasping
and
the
long
yellow
hair
which
usually
lay
in
a
flat
clean
sweep
from
forehead
to
occiput
now
sprawled
in
a
grotesque
pattern
round
his
temples
it
cold
sure
enough
but
jump
in
the
air
will
be
all
right
i
be
back
with
you
in
a
moment
randolph
advanced
to
the
edge
and
felt
in
turn
it
cold
but
he
meant
to
manage
it
here
just
as
he
had
managed
with
the
two
heads
bobbed
on
the
water
where
but
one
had
bobbed
before
ceremonially
at
least
the
rite
was
complete
it
never
so
cold
the
second
time
declared
cope
encouragingly
one
dip
does
make
a
swim
any
more
than
one
swallow
he
flashed
his
soles
in
the
sunlight
and
was
once
again
immersed
gulping
in
a
maelstrom
of
his
own
making
twice
to
oblige
you
said
randolph
but
no
more
i
leave
the
rest
to
the
sun
and
the
air
cope
out
again
ran
up
and
down
the
sands
for
a
hundred
feet
or
so
i
know
something
better
than
this
he
declared
presently
he
threw
himself
down
and
rolled
himself
in
the
abundance
of
fine
dry
clean
sand
an
arenaceous
ulster
speaking
etymologically
he
said
he
came
back
to
the
clump
of
basswoods
near
which
randolph
was
sitting
on
a
short
length
of
drift
wood
with
his
back
to
the
sun
and
sat
down
beside
him
you
welcome
to
it
said
randolph
laughing
but
how
are
you
going
to
get
it
off
by
another
dip
certainly
not
by
the
slow
process
of
time
we
have
some
moments
to
spare
but
hardly
enough
for
that
meanwhile
he
picked
up
a
handful
of
sand
and
applied
it
to
a
bare
which
somehow
had
failed
to
get
its
share
of
protection
thanks
said
cope
the
right
thing
done
for
polynices
yes
i
shall
take
one
final
dip
and
dry
myself
on
my
handkerchief
i
shall
dry
by
the
other
process
and
so
shall
be
able
to
spare
you
mine
how
much
time
have
we
yet
randolph
reached
for
his
trousers
as
they
hung
on
a
lower
branch
of
one
of
the
basswoods
oh
a
good
of
an
hour
that
time
enough
and
to
spare
i
wonder
whom
we
going
to
meet
there
a
crowd
the
three
young
ladies
commonly
one
or
two
young
men
who
understand
how
to
tinker
the
which
usually
needs
it
and
how
to
prime
the
pump
they
once
asked
me
to
do
these
things
but
i
discovered
that
younger
men
enjoy
it
more
than
i
do
so
i
let
them
do
it
besides
these
a
number
of
miscellaneous
people
perhaps
who
come
out
by
trolley
or
in
their
own
cars
the
young
ladies
always
come
asked
cope
brushing
the
sand
from
his
chest
usually
together
the
graces
otherwise
what
becomes
of
the
group
well
i
hope
there
be
enough
fellows
to
look
after
the
stove
and
the
pump
and
them
i
not
much
good
at
that
last
no
there
a
knack
about
it
a
technique
that
i
do
seem
to
possess
nor
do
i
seem
greatly
prompted
to
learn
it
of
course
there
is
no
more
reason
for
assuming
that
every
man
will
make
a
good
lover
than
that
every
woman
will
make
a
good
mother
or
a
good
housekeeper
or
that
every
adult
male
will
make
a
good
citizen
desiring
the
general
welfare
and
bestirring
himself
to
contribute
his
own
share
to
it
i
do
feel
that
i
an
especially
creditable
one
so
it
runs
we
ground
our
general
life
on
theories
and
then
the
facts
come
up
and
slap
us
in
the
face
randolph
rose
and
relieved
the
basswood
of
the
first
garments
are
you
about
ready
for
that
final
dip
cope
made
his
last
plunge
and
returned
red
and
shivering
to
use
the
two
handkerchiefs
well
we
have
thirty
minutes
said
randolph
as
they
resumed
their
march
on
the

the
ragged
line
of
dunes
with
their
draping
dense
or
slight
of
pines
lindens
and
oaks
on
the
other
the
unruffled
expanse
of
blue
spreading
toward
a
horizon
even
less
determinate
than
before
no
i
not
at
all
apt
said
cope
returning
to
his
theme
not
even
for
i
suppose
i
pretty
sure
to
get
caught
some
time
or
other
each
woman
according
to
her
powers
and
gifts
varying
degrees
of
desire
of
determination
of
dexterity
to
be
just
i
might
add
a
fourth
devotion
you
run
the
gauntlet
said
cope
you
seem
to
have
come
through
all
right
well
randolph
returned
deprecatingly
i
ca
really
claim
ever
to
have
enlisted
any
woman
best
endeavors
i
hope
i
shall
have
the
same
good
luck
of
your
four
it
the
dexterity
that
gives
me
the
most
dread
yes
the
appeal
not
always
honest
to
chivalry
though
devotion
is
sometimes
a
close
second
you
manoeuvred
into
a
position
where
you
made
to
think
you
i
known
chaps
to
marry
on
that
basis
it
weary
waiting
until
madame
dies
and
madonna
steps
into
her
place
meanwhile
safety
in
numbers
yes
even
though
you
in
the
very
midst
of
wishing
or
of
wondering
or
of
a
careful
concern
to
cloak
either
do
dwell
on
it
you
fill
me
with
apprehensions
randolph
put
up
his
arm
and
pointed
a
roof
through
a
notch
between
two
sandhills
beyond
a
long
range
of
them
was
seen
set
high
and
half
hidden
by
the
spreading
limbs
of
pines
there
it
is
he
said
so
close
already
such
indeed
it
appeared
not
so
close
as
it
seems
we
may
just
as
well
step
lively
cope
with
an
abundance
of
free
action
was
treading
along
on
the
very
edge
of
things
careless
of
the
rough
shingle
and
indifferent
to
the
probability
of
wet
feet
and
swinging
his
hat
as
he
went
in
some
such
spirit
perhaps
advanced
young
stoutheart
to
the
ogre
castle
he
even
began
to
foot
it
a
little
faster
well
i
can
keep
up
with
you
yet
thought
randolph
aloud
he
said
you
done
very
well
with
your
hair
quite
an
inspiration
to
have
carried
a
comb
cope
grimaced
i
trust
i
free
to
comb
myself
on
sunday
there
are
plenty
of
others
to
do
it
for
me
through
the
week
at
his
house
you
look
as
fit
as
two
fiddles
said
medora
phillips
at
the
top
of
her
sandhill
we
are
declared
randolph
have
the
rest
of
the
orchestra
arrived
most
of
us
are
here
and
the
rest
will
arrive
presently
listen
i
think
i
hear
a
honk
somewhere
back
in
the
woods
the
big
room
of
the
house
made
by
knocking
two
small
rooms
together
seemed
fairly
full
already
and
other
guests
were
on
the
back
porch
the
graces
were
there
putting
the
to
the
table
helga
had
not
come
after
all
but
had
gone
instead
with
her
young
man
to
spend
a
few
sunny
afternoon
hours
among
the
films
and
one
of
the
young
present
at
phillips
dinner
was
present
here
he
seemed
to
know
how
to
handle
the
and
the
pump
with
the
cooperation
of
the
chauffeur
and
how
to
aid
the
three
handmaidens
in
putting
on
the
knives
forks
plates
and
napkins
that
helga
had
decided
to
ignore
the
people
in
the
distant
became
less
distant
soon
they
stopped
in
a
clearing
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
before
long
they
appeared
at
the
top
with
a
small
hamper
of
provisions
oh
why
did
you
ask
to
bring
something
cried
cope
randolph
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
saw
himself
lugging
a
basket
of
eatables
through
five
miles
of
sand
and
thicket
you
brought
yourself
declared
phillips
genially
enough
there
was
room
for
the
whole
dozen
on
the
the
favored
few
in
one
corner
of
it
could
glimpse
the
blue
plane
of
the
lake
or
at
least
catch
the
horizon
the
rest
could
look
over
the
treetops
toward
the
changing
colors
of
the
wide
marshes
inland
and
when
the
feast
was
over
the
chauffeur
took
his
refreshment
off
to
one
side
and
then
amiably
lent
a
hand
with
the
dishes
let
me
help
wipe
cried
cope
impulsively
there
are
plenty
of
hands
to
help
returned
his
hostess
she
seemed
to
be
putting
him
on
a
higher
plane
and
saving
him
for
better
things
one
of
the
better
things
was
a
stroll
over
her
tumultuous
domain
the
five
miles
he
had
already
covered
were
not
enough
i
stay
where
i
am
declared
randolph
who
had
taken
this
regulation
jaunt
before
he
followed
cope
to
the
hook
from
which
he
was
taking
down
his
hat
admire
everything
he
counselled
in
a
whisper
eh
adjust
yourself
to
our
dominant
mood
without
delay
or
reluctance
praise
promptly
and
fully
everything
that
is
ours
the
party
consisted
of
four
or
five
of
the
younger
people
and
two
or
three
of
the
older
most
of
them
had
taken
the
walk
before
cope
as
a
novice
became
the
especial
care
of
phillips
herself
the
way
led
sandily
along
the
crest
of
a
wooded
amphitheatre
with
less
stress
on
the
prospect
waterward
than
might
have
been
expected
cope
was
not
allowed
indeed
to
overlook
the
vague
horizon
where
through
the
pine
groves
the
blue
of
sky
and
of
sea
blended
into
one
but
under
medora
phillips
guidance
his
eyes
were
mostly
turned
inland
people
think
she
said
that
dunes
means
nothing
beyond
a
regular
row
of
sandhills
following
the
edge
of
the
water
yet
half
the
interest
and
of
the
variety
are
to
be
found
in
behind
them
see
my
wide
marsh
off
to
the
southeast
with
those
islands
of
tamarack
here
and
there
and
imagine
how
beautiful
the
shadows
are
toward
sunset
look
at
that
thick
wood
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
do
you
think
it
is
flat
no
it
as
humpy
and
hilly
as
anything
ever
traversed
only
this
spring
a
fascinating
murderer
hid
there
for
weeks
and
last
january
we
could
hear
the
howls
of
driven
down
from
michigan
by
the
cold
and
see
those
tall
dead
pines
rising
above
it
all
i
call
them
the
three
witches
you
get
them
better
just
a
few
paces
to
the
left
this
way
she
even
placed
her
hand
on
his
elbow
to
make
sure
that
her
tragic
group
should
appear
to
highest
advantage
yes
he
was
an
admirable
young
man
giving
admirable
attention
thrusting
out
his
hat
toward
prospects
of
exceptional
account
and
casting
his
frank
blue
eyes
into
her
face
charmingly
perfect
teeth
and
a
wonderful
sweep
of
yellow
hair
a
highly
civilized
faun
for
her
highly
sylvan
setting
indifferent
perhaps
to
her
precious
trio
but
there
were
other
young
fellows
to
look
after
cope
praised
loudly
and
readily
the
region
was
unique
and
every
view
had
its
charm
every
view
save
one
beyond
the
woods
and
the
hills
and
the
distant
marshes
which
spread
behind
all
these
there
rose
on
the
bluish
horizon
a
sole
tall
chimney
with
its
long
black
streak
of
smoke
below
it
and
about
it
spread
a
vast
rectangular
structure
with
at
its
corners
the
chimney
bespoke
light
and
heat
and
power
furnished
in
quantities
power
for
many
shops
manned
by
compulsory
workers
a
prison
in
short
why
what
that
asked
cope
tactlessly
medora
phillips
withheld
her
eyes
and
sent
out
a
guiding
finger
in
the
opposite
direction
only
see
the
red
of
those
maples
she
said
and
that
other
red
just
to
the
left
the
tree
with
the
small
fine
leaves
all
aflame
do
you
know
what
it
is
i
afraid
not
it
a
tupelo
and
this
shrub
right
here
she
took
between
her
fingers
one
large
bland
indented
leaf
on
a
small
tree
close
to
the
path
cope
shook
his
head
why
it
a
sassafras
and
this
she
thrust
her
toe
into
a
thick
lustrous
bed
of
tiny
leaves
that
hugged
the
ground
no
again
kinnikinnick
oh
my
poor
boy
you
have
everything
to
learn
brought
up
in
the
country
too
but
really
said
cope
in
defense
freeford
is
so
small
as
and
even
in
the
country
one
may
turn
by
preference
to
books
try
me
on
primroses
and
and
pomegranates
medora
broke
off
a
branch
of
sassafras
and
swished
it
to
and
fro
as
she
walked
see
she
said
three
kinds
of
leaves
on
the
same
tree
one
without
lobes
one
with
a
single
lobe
and
one
with
two
is
nature
wonderful
replied
cope
easily
meanwhile
the
young
ladies
sauntered
along
before
or
behind
as
the
case
might
be
in
the
company
of
the
young
and
that
of
another
youth
who
had
come
out
independently
on
the
trolley
they
appeared
to
be
suitably
accompanied
and
entertained
but
shiftings
and
readjustments
ensued
as
they
are
sure
to
do
with
a
cope
presently
found
himself
scuffling
through
the
thin
grass
and
the
briery
thickets
alongside
the
young
he
was
a
clever
companionable
chap
but
he
declared
himself
all
too
soon
even
in
this
remote
arcadia
as
utterly
true
to
type
cope
was
not
long
in
feeling
him
as
operating
on
the
unconscious
assumption
unconscious
and
therefore
all
the
more
damnable
that
the
young
man
in
business
constituted
ipso
facto
a
kind
of
norm
by
which
other
young
men
in
other
fields
of
endeavor
were
to
be
gauged
the
farther
they
deviated
from
the
standard
he
automatically
set
up
the
more
lamentable
their
deficiencies
a
few
condescending
inquiries
as
to
the
academic
life
that
strange
aberration
from
the
normality
of
the
practical
and
profitable
course
which
made
the
ordinary
life
of
the
day
and
the
separation
came
enough
of
muttered
cope
to
himself
presently
and
began
to
cast
about
for
other
company
amy
leffingwell
was
strolling
along
alone
he
caught
a
branch
of
haw
from
before
her
meditative
face
and
proffered
a
general
remark
about
the
beauty
of
the
day
and
the
interest
in
the
changing
prospect
amy
pretty
pink
face
brightened
it
a
lovely
day
she
said
and
the
more
of
this
lovely
weather
we
have
in
october
and
especially
in
november
the
more
trouble
it
makes
surely
you
do
want
rain
or
frost
no
but
it
becomes
harder
to
shut
the
house
up
for
good
and
all
last
fall
we
opened
and
closed
two
or
three
times
we
even
tried
coming
out
in
december
in
mackintoshes
and
rubber
boots
almost
but
the
boots
are
better
for
february
at
least
they
would
have
been
last
february
it
seems
hard
to
imagine
such
a
future
for
a
place
like
this
or
such
a
past
things
can
be
pretty
rough
i
assure
you
and
the
roads
are
not
always
as
good
as
they
are
and
when
the
pump
froze
she
went
on
they
had
to
depend
upon
the
lake
and
when
the
lake
froze
they
had
to
fall
back
on
melted
snow
and
ice
and
even
when
the
lake
did
freeze
the
blowing
waters
and
the
flying
sands
often
heaped
up
big
ridges
that
quite
cut
them
off
from
the
open
sea
then
they
had
to
prospect
along
those
tawny
hummocks
for
some
small
inlet
that
would
yield
a
few
buckets
of
frozen
spray
keeping
on
the
right
side
of
the
deep
fissures
that
held
the
threat
of
icebergs
to
be
cast
loose
at
any
moment
and
sometimes
she
added
in
search
of
a
little
thrill
we
would
get
back
toward
shore
to
find
deep
openings
with
clear
water
dashing
beneath
we
had
been
walking
on
a
mere
half
the
time
most
interesting
said
cope
accommodatingly
he
saw
no
winter
shore
yes
february
was
bad
but
phillips
wanted
to
make
sure
toward
the
end
of
the
winter
that
the
house
had
blown
away
nor
the
contents
for
we
have
housebreakers
every
so
often
and
hortense
wanted
to
make
some
i
believe
she
going
to
try
for
some
more
is
a
good
day
unless
the
october
tints
are
too
obvious
she
says
they
are
not
subtle
but
that
she
can
use
them
well
here
he
was
talking
along
handily
enough
but
he
had
no
notion
of
talking
for
long
about
hortense
he
preferred
returning
to
the
weather
and
what
does
such
a
day
do
for
you
he
asked
oh
i
suppose
it
helps
me
in
a
general
way
but
notes
of
course
are
on
paper
already
yes
he
was
walking
alongside
her
and
holding
his
own
thus
far
she
seemed
a
pretty
enough
graceful
enough
little
thing
not
so
tall
by
an
inch
or
so
as
she
appeared
when
seated
behind
that
samovar
on
that
day
she
had
been
reasonably
sprightly
toward
others
even
if
not
toward
him
she
seemed
meditative
rather
even
elegiac
unless
there
was
a
possible
tang
in
her
reference
to
aside
from
that
possibility
there
was
little
indication
of
the
dexterity
which
randolph
had
asked
him
to
beware
on
paper
already
he
repeated
but
not
all
of
them
i
know
you
compose
you
are
not
saying
that
you
are
about
to
give
composition
up
a
forced
and
awkward
slur
perhaps
but
it
served
she
gave
a
little
sigh
pupils
do
want
pieces
she
said
scales
exercises
i
know
he
returned
themes
clearness
mass
unity
it
the
same
they
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
we
ought
not
to
think
of
such
things
she
said
phillips
came
along
shepherding
her
little
flock
for
the
return
but
before
we
turn
back
she
adjured
them
just
look
at
those
two
lovely
spreading
pines
standing
together
alone
on
that
far
hill
the
small
group
gazed
obediently
though
to
many
of
them
the
prospect
was
a
familiar
one
yes
there
stood
two
pines
one
just
a
little
taller
than
the
other
and
just
a
little
inclined
across
the
top
a
girl
out
here
in
august
called
them
paolo
and
francesca
do
you
think
she
asked
cope
that
those
names
are
suitable
oh
i
do
know
he
replied
looking
at
the
trees
thoughtfully
they
seem
rather
static
and
dante
lovers
if
i
recollect
had
considerable
drive
they
were
on
the
wind
were
they
it
might
be
less
violent
and
more
modern
to
call
your
trees
pelleas
and
melisande
or
that
it
that
the
very
thing
said
medora
phillips
heartily
pelleas
and
melisande
of
course
that
girl
had
a
very
ordinary
mind
i
felt
plenty
of
wind
on
the
dunes
more
than
once
interjected
hortense
or
darby
and
joan
cope
continued
not
that
i
defending
that
poor
creature
whoever
she
was
they
seem
to
be
a
pretty
staid
couple
do
said
medora
too
many
ideas
are
worse
than
too
few
they
confuse
one
and
amy
leffingwell
who
had
seemed
willing
to
admire
him
now
looked
at
him
with
an
air
of
plaintive
protest
and
joan
muttered
hortense
into
a
sumach
bush
you
might
as
well
call
them
jack
and
jill
they
pelleas
and
melisande
declared
phillips
in
a
tone
of
finality
thank
you
so
much
she
said
with
a
smile
that
reinstated
cope
after
a
threatened
lapse
from
favor
enlivens
the
as
they
drew
near
the
house
they
heard
the
tones
of
a
gramophone
this
instrument
rested
flatly
on
a
small
table
and
took
the
place
of
a
piano
which
would
have
been
a
fearful
thing
to
transport
from
town
and
back
it
was
jigging
away
merrily
enough
with
a
quick
regular
rhythm
which
suggested
a
and
when
the
party
the
big
room
it
was
seen
that
a
large
corner
of
the
center
rug
was
still
turned
back
impossible
that
anybody
could
have
been
dancing
on
the
sabbath
surely
everybody
understood
that
the
evangelical
principles
of
churchton
were
projected
on
these
occasions
to
the
dunes
besides
the
only
women
left
behind
had
been
two
in
their
forties
the
men
in
their
company
were
even
older
medora
phillips
looked
at
randolph
but
he
was
staring
inexpressively
at
the
opposite
wall
she
found
herself
wondering
if
there
were
times
when
the
mere
absence
of
the
young
served
automatically
to
make
the
more
youthful
well
we
had
a
most
lovely
walk
she
declared
she
crossed
to
the
far
corner
of
the
room
contriving
to
turn
down
the
rug
as
she
went
and
opened
up
a
new
reservoir
of
records
she
laid
them
on
the
table
rather
emphatically
as
if
to
say
are
suited
to
the
day
i
hope
you
all
rested
up
she
continued
and
put
one
of
the
new
records
on
the
machine
the
air
was
from
a
modern
opera
true
but
it
was
and
had
even
been
fitted
out
with
sacred
words
everybody
knew
it
and
presently
everybody
was
humming
it
it
ought
not
to
be
hummed
she
declared
it
ought
to
be
sung
you
can
sing
it
mr
cope
oh
yes
indeed
replied
cope
readily
enough
i
have
the
breath
left
i
think
or
i
can
very
soon
find
it
take
a
few
minutes
i
fill
in
with
something
else
they
listened
to
an
inconclusive
thing
by
a
wobbling
soprano
and
then
phillips
put
the
other
record
back
the
accompaniment
to
the
air
was
rather
rich
and
dense
and
the
general
was
somewhat
blatant
but
cope
stood
up
to
it
all
and
had
the
inspiration
to
treat
the
new
combination
as
a
sort
of
but
he
was
relieved
from
the
bother
of
accompanying
himself
his
resonance
overlaid
in
some
measure
the
cheap
quality
of
the
tone
he
contrived
to
master
a
degree
of
momentum
to
let
himself
go
and
the
general
result
was
good
much
better
than
his
attempt
at
that
tea
hortense
and
carolyn
looked
at
him
with
a
new
respect
and
amy
who
had
been
willing
to
admire
now
admired
openly
cope
ended
gave
a
slight
grimace
and
sauntered
away
from
the
table
and
the
instrument
he
knew
that
he
had
done
rather
well
bravo
loudly
cried
one
of
the
ladies
who
felt
that
she
was
under
suspicion
of
having
taken
a
step
or
two
in
the
dance
and
oh
my
dear
said
phillips
to
her
sotto
voce
is
he
utterly
charming
cope
wiped
his
brow
the
walk
had
made
him
warm
and
the
singing
had
made
him
warmer
one
or
two
of
the
women
were
using
chance
pamphlets
as
fans
despite
phillips
doubts
and
everybody
showed
a
willingness
to
keep
in
the
draught
from
the
open
windows
is
it
close
here
asked
the
hostess
anxiously
the
day
is
almost
like
summer
if
the
water
is
anywhere
nearly
as
warm
as
the
air
is
let
me
see
it
a
quarter
to
four
i
have
a
closetful
of
bathing
suits
all
sizes
and
shapes
and
several
colors
if
anybody
cares
to
go
in
do
cried
cope
explosively
she
looked
at
him
with
interest
have
you
been
trying
it
i
have
on
the
way
along
the
shore
i
assure
you
however
warm
the
air
may
be
the
bathing
season
is
over
well
i
rather
thought
something
had
been
happening
to
you
randolph
is
it
as
bad
as
he
says
i
take
his
word
replied
randolph
and
i
think
all
of
us
had
better
do
the
same
we
might
go
down
to
the
beach
anyway
she
said
hortense
wants
to
make
her
and
the
color
will
be
good
from
now
on
several
of
the
party
threaded
their
way
down
over
the
sliding
sandy
path
which
led
through
the
pines
and
junipers
cope
was
willing
to
go
with
the
others
on
the
present
understanding
he
objected
to
promiscuous
bathing
even
more
strongly
than
he
objected
to
promiscuous
dancing
there
were
some
new
cumuli
in
the
east
out
above
the
water
and
they
began
to
take
the
late
afternoon
sun
hortense
cast
about
for
just
the
right
point
of
view
with
carolyn
to
help
on
atmosphere
and
two
young
men
to
be
superserviceable
over
campstool
and
box
of
colors
she
brought
back
a
few
dabs
which
may
have
served
some
future
use
at
all
events
they
served
as
items
in
a
social
record
cope
and
amy
with
some
of
the
others
strolled
off
in
the
opposite
direction
the
water
remained
smooth
and
some
of
the
men
idly
skipped
stones
one
of
them
dipped
in
his
hand
cold
he
exclaimed
i
should
say
amy
looked
admiringly
at
cope
as
one
who
had
braved
beyond
season
the
chill
of
the
great
deep
and
he
tried
to
reward
her
with
a
thought
or
two
he
had
skipped
stones
himself
between
dips
and
randolph
had
made
a
reflection
which
he
could
now
revise
and
employ
see
he
said
as
a
flat
waveworn
piece
of
slate
left
the
hand
of
the
young
and
careered
over
the
water
one
two
three
six
eight
ten
thirteen
and
then
down
down
after
all
down
to
the
bottom
and
so
we
end
every
one
of
us
the
great
thing
is
to
crowd
in
all
the
action
we
can
before
the
final
plunge
comes
to
go
skipping
and
splashing
as
hard
and
long
and
fast
and
far
as
we
may
a
valuable
thought
possibly
and
elaborated
beyond
randolph
sketchy
and
casual
utterance
but
amy
looked
uncomfortable
and
chilled
and
glanced
with
little
favor
at
a
few
other
flat
stones
lying
at
her
feet
please
do
please
change
the
subject
she
seemed
to
ask
she
changed
it
herself
you
sang
beautifully
she
said
with
some
return
of
warmth
even
with
some
approach
to
fervor
oh
i
can
sing
he
returned
nonchalantly
if
i
can
only
have
my
hands
in
my
pockets
or
waving
in
the
air
or
anywhere
but
on
a
keyboard
i
wish
you
had
let
them
persuade
you
to
sing
another
she
was
not
only
willing
to
admire
but
desirous
conscientious
amends
perhaps
for
an
earlier
verdict
one
or
two
more
skips
you
know
after
getting
started
oh
once
was
enough
a
happy
coincidence
the
next
might
have
been
an
unhappy
one
you
have
never
learned
to
accompany
yourself
as
you
seen
i
a
rather
poor
hand
at
it
i
depended
a
good
deal
on
others
or
better
on
another
she
looked
at
him
earnestly
have
you
ever
sung
to
an
obbligato
none
of
my
songs
thus
far
has
called
for
one
an
obbligato
never
so
much
honored
no
indeed
why
to
me
it
would
seem
almost
like
singing
with
an
orchestra
imagine
a
imagine
a
flute
still
i
not
a
soprano
going
mad
or
imagine
a
saxophone
that
might
be
droll
he
gave
out
a
sort
of
dragging
bleat
she
did
not
smile
perhaps
she
felt
such
an
approach
to
waggery
unworthy
of
him
perhaps
she
was
holding
him
up
to
the
dignity
of
the
natural
scene
and
to
the
importance
of
the
occasion
as
she
conceived
it
cope
had
no
desire
to
figure
as
a
comique
and
at
once
regained
sobriety
of
course
he
admitted
we
are
not
at
a
or
a
cabaret
such
things
ought
not
to
be
thought
of
here
she
turned
her
eyes
on
him
again
with
a
new
look
of
sympathy
and
understanding
perhaps
understanding
between
them
had
failed
or
lapsed
but
a
moment
before
how
all
of
this
shames
the
town
she
said
and
us
if
we
misbehave
he
added
phillips
came
scurrying
along
collecting
her
scattered
guests
as
before
tea
she
said
tea
for
one
or
two
who
must
make
an
early
start
back
to
town
also
a
sip
and
a
bite
for
those
who
stay
she
moved
along
toward
hortense
and
her
little
group
did
not
appear
to
amount
to
much
hortense
seemed
to
have
been
fussed
either
by
an
excess
of
company
and
of
help
or
by
some
private
source
of
discontent
and
disequilibrium
come
phillips
cried
to
her
i
need
every
martha
to
lend
a
hand
hortense
rose
and
one
of
her
young
men
picked
up
her
campstool
so
glad
you
have
got
to
go
early
said
phillips
to
randolph
and
cope
in
fact
you
might
stay
all
night
it
will
be
warm
and
there
are
cots
and
blankets
for
the
porch
thanks
indeed
said
cope
but
i
have
a
class
at
morning
and
they
be
waiting
to
hear
about
the
english
novel
in
the
eighteenth
century
worse
luck
fielding
and
richardson
and
are
you
going
to
explain
pamela
and
clarissa
to
them
asked
hortense
she
was
abrupt
and
possibly
a
bit
scornful
cope
seemed
to
scent
a
challenge
and
accepted
it
i
am
the
women
may
figure
on
the
covers
but
the
men
play
their
own
strong
part
through
the
pages
i
seem
to
recall
contributed
phillips
that
sir
charles
grandison
figured
both
ways
that
prig
said
hortense
well
if
you
ca
stay
overnight
phillips
proceeded
at
least
stay
a
few
hours
for
the
moonlight
the
moon
will
be
almost
full
and
the
walk
across
the
marshes
to
the
ought
to
be
beautiful
or
peter
could
run
you
across
in
eight
or
ten
minutes
she
did
not
urge
randolph
to
remain
in
the
absence
of
cope
though
randolph
appearance
at
his
office
at
ten
in
the
morning
would
have
surprised
no
one
and
have
embarrassed
no
one
tea
was
served
before
the
big
fireplace
in
which
a
small
flame
to
heat
the
kettle
was
rising
randolph
set
his
empty
cup
on
the
shelf
above
notice
said
phillips
to
him
that
poem
of
carolyn
just
behind
your
cup
day
in
duneland
it
was
a
bit
of
verse
in
a
narrow
black
frame
and
the
mat
was
embellished
with
drawings
of
the
dunes
to
the
effect
of
an
etching
an
etcher
in
fact
a
man
famous
in
his
field
had
made
them
phillips
explained
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
shelf
she
advised
him
is
a
poem
in
free
verse
done
by
a
real
journalist
who
was
here
in
june
see
to
dunecrest
written
with
a
blue
pencil
on
a
bit
of
driftwood
sorry
ca
leave
any
souvenir
behind
said
cope
who
had
stolen
up
and
was
looking
at
the
poem
over
randolph
shoulder
but
one
must
first
be
clever
and
one
must
second
know
how
to
put
his
cleverness
on
record
i
shall
remember
record
she
returned
with
emphasis
cope
smiled
deprecatingly
but
he
felt
sure
that
he
had
sung
well
the
moonlight
when
it
came
was
all
that
medora
phillips
had
promised
there
was
another
stroll
on
the
beach
with
cope
between
medora
and
carolyn
then
he
and
randolph
took
the
causeway
across
the
marsh
stopped
the
trolley
by
burning
a
newspaper
on
the
track
and
started
on
the
long
trip
home
as
the
car
ran
along
jerkily
from
station
to
station
the
earlier
void
of
duneland
became
peopled
indeed
the
extraordinarily
mild
day
had
drawn
out
hundreds
had
given
the
moribund
season
a
new
lease
of
life
every
stoppage
brought
so
many
more
young
men
in
soiled
khaki
with
shapeless
packs
on
their
backs
and
so
many
more
wan
maidens
no
longer
young
who
were
trying
in
little
bands
to
capture
from
nature
the
joys
thus
far
denied
by
domestic
life
and
at
one
station
a
belated
squad
of
the
lovers
of
landscape
some
forty
or
fifty
in
all
came
flooding
in
with
the
day
spoils
masses
of
asters
and
goldenrod
with
the
roots
as
often
as
not
festoons
of
bittersweet
and
sheaves
of
sumach
and
golden
glow
and
one
ardent
spirit
staggered
in
under
the
weight
of
an
immense
brown
paper
bag
stuffed
with
prickly
pear
as
the
company
slid
along
children
drowsed
or
whimpered
young
men
quarreled
with
the
conductor
elderly
folk
sat
in
squeezed
plaintive
resignation
soon
the
lights
of
foundry
fires
began
to
show
on
the
sky
then
people
started
dropping
off
in
the
streets
of
towns
enlivened
by
the
glitter
of
many
saloons
and
an
occasional
loud
glare
from
the
front
of
a
theater
through
these
many
miles
randolph
and
cope
sat
silent
there
seemed
to
be
a
tacit
agreement
that
they
need
no
longer
exert
themselves
to
entertain
each
other
cope
reached
home
shortly
before
midnight
by
next
morning
many
of
the
doings
of
the
previous
day
had
quite
passed
from
his
mind
yet
a
few
firm
impressions
remained
he
had
had
a
good
swim
if
but
a
brief
one
with
a
companion
who
had
been
willing
even
if
not
bold
he
had
imposed
an
acceptable
nomenclature
upon
a
somewhat
anonymous
landscape
and
in
circumstances
slightly
absurd
or
at
least
unfavorable
he
had
done
his
voice
and
his
method
high
credit
in
song
all
else
went
for
next
to
nothing
amidst
next
morning
mail
brought
cope
a
letter
from
arthur
lemoyne
the
letter
was
short
at
least
when
compared
with
cope
own
plentiful
pennings
but
it
gave
our
young
instructor
a
few
points
to
think
about
while
he
was
illuminating
clarissa
harlowe
and
making
some
careful
comments
on
joseph
andrews
released
toward
noon
he
read
the
letter
over
again
and
he
ran
over
it
again
during
lunch
lemoyne
possessed
a
variety
of
gifts
but
the
gift
of
in
an
extended
form
was
not
among
them
he
said
all
he
had
to
say
in
four
moderate
pages
yours
received
he
wrote
am
glad
the
year
has
opened
up
so
interestingly
for
you
of
course
i
want
to
come
down
as
soon
as
i
can
i
can
and
be
with
you
well
the
if
as
the
latter
part
of
the
letter
indicated
was
not
likely
to
prove
insurmountable
the
assurance
that
he
wanted
to
come
was
grateful
though
superfluous
who
had
supposed
for
a
moment
that
he
did
still
the
thing
put
down
in
plain
black
and
white
had
its
look
of
comfort
of
course
the
business
is
not
gaining
much
through
my
connection
with
it
i
expect
father
begins
to
see
pretty
plainly
as
for
the
cathedral
choir
and
the
dramatic
club
and
all
the
rest
i
am
willing
to
throw
them
over
expecting
that
larger
interests
can
be
opened
to
me
by
cope
paused
on
these
points
he
had
suggested
that
lemoyne
enroll
as
a
student
in
some
slight
course
or
other
with
the
hope
that
his
voice
might
lead
to
his
wearing
cap
and
gown
at
chapel
services
and
that
his
dramatic
experience
might
give
him
some
role
in
the
annual
operetta
in
either
of
these
quarters
a
good
tenor
voice
was
usually
to
seek
and
as
for
the
business
well
he
had
once
overheard
the
elder
partner
audibly
wonder
whether
arthur
would
ever
learn
how
to
ship
a
keg
of
nails
out
of
their
back
door
even
cope
pushed
away
his
and
asked
the
young
greek
for
a
cut
of
pie
i
sort
of
sounded
father
the
other
day
but
he
was
pretty
huffy
try
again
soon
but
i
doubt
if
i
can
manage
to
come
down
until
after
the
holidays
you
begin
a
new
term
then
i
suppose
the
fact
is
i
took
a
week
off
in
the
middle
of
september
and
father
has
forgiven
it
one
of
our
fellows
in
the
choir
had
just
bought
a
little
roadster
and
he
invited
me
for
a
trip
to
green
bay
and
beyond
we
dipped
along
through
fish
creek
ephraim
and
so
on
good
weather
good
roads
good
scenery
good
hotels
and
a
pleasant
time
was
had
by
all
or
rather
by
cope
dwelt
darkly
on
this
passage
arthur
was
flighty
arthur
was
volatile
arthur
was
even
fickle
when
the
mood
took
him
some
arrangement
that
partook
more
of
the
was
needed
but
there
was
comfort
of
a
kind
in
the
next
passage
though
father
at
best
will
do
very
little
and
though
i
have
just
now
little
enough
of
my
own
there
may
be
somebody
or
other
among
your
faculty
or
trustees
who
could
find
me
a
niche
in
the
college
library
or
in
the
registrar
office
or
have
all
such
posts
been
snapped
up
by
a
small
weekly
stipend
would
rather
help
our
this
definite
inquiry
which
carried
its
own
answer
seemed
to
drive
one
or
two
brass
tacks
with
some
definiteness
cope
himself
was
eking
out
his
small
salary
with
a
small
allowance
from
home
next
year
with
the
thesis
accomplished
better
pay
in
some
better
place
a
present
partner
and
pal
ought
to
be
a
prop
rather
than
a
drag
however
welcome
his
company
he
must
bear
his
share
look
about
a
bit
for
quarters
lemoyne
went
on
drawing
toward
his
conclusion
i
presume
is
little
more
for
two
than
for
one
possibly
he
put
down
in
an
afterthought
i
might
get
a
job
in
the
city
and
then
with
warm
regards
he
came
to
a
close
as
art
cope
finished
his
lunch
and
walked
out
if
arthur
could
do
one
thing
better
than
another
it
was
to
make
coffee
his
product
was
assuredly
better
than
the
greek
the
two
had
camped
out
more
than
once
on
the
shores
of
lake
winnebago
and
arthur
had
deftly
managed
the
commissariat
they
had
had
good
times
together
and
had
needed
no
other
company
how
had
it
been
on
green
bay
at
eagle
cliff
and
apron
bluff
and
all
the
other
places
lately
celebrated
in
lithographed
folders
and
lately
popularized
by
motorists
and
who
was
the
particular
fellow
who
ran
the
roadster
late
that
afternoon
cope
chanced
upon
randolph
among
the
fantastic
basins
and
floral
parterres
of
the
court
in
front
of
the
botany
building
randolph
had
had
a
small
matter
for
one
of
the
deans
together
they
sauntered
over
to
the
lake
from
the
edge
of
the
bluff
they
walked
out
upon
the
concrete
terrace
above
the
general
and
its
dynamos
alongside
this
the
vast
tonnage
of
coal
required
for
the
coming
winter
was
beginning
to
pile
up
the
weather
was
still
mild
and
sunny
and
the
lake
was
as
valiantly
blue
as
ever
it
does
look
like
the
same
body
of
water
does
it
said
cope
it
might
be
just
as
beautiful
in
its
own
way
here
as
we
found
it
yesterday
out
there
returned
randolph
i
asked
my
i
do
know
how
many
times
why
they
ca
do
better
by
this
unfortunate
campus
and
bring
it
all
up
to
a
reasonable
level
of
seemliness
but
you
have
a
relative
among
the
yes
my
sister
husband
is
one
of
the
university
trustees
but
he
lives
miles
from
this
spot
and
hardly
ever
sees
it
besides
his
aesthetic
endowments
are
not
beyond
those
of
the
average
university
trustee
sometimes
they
as
hard
on
beauty
as
they
are
on
free
speech
i
see
they
hard
on
beauty
and
i
may
live
to
find
free
speech
mauled
too
well
you
not
in
sociology
or
economics
still
do
trifle
with
a
aesthetic
idol
either
trustees
and
department
heads
are
conservative
oh
you
mean
about
about
your
immortal
william
he
wrote
them
do
try
to
rob
him
do
try
to
knock
him
off
his
pedestal
oh
you
thinking
about
my
thesis
what
i
said
about
warwickshire
was
just
a
little
flight
of
fancy
i
guess
a
bit
of
doorstep
travel
i
likely
enough
to
stay
where
i
am
well
how
about
the
thesis
really
i
think
i
shall
end
by
digging
something
out
of
here
and
now
school
of
fiction
what
would
you
think
of
that
h
if
you
can
make
it
seem
worth
while
well
ca
i
your
work
from
the
very
nature
of
it
must
be
critical
now
the
critic
nine
times
out
of
ten
takes
down
a
volume
from
its
established
shelf
dusts
it
off
ruffles
the
leaves
a
bit
and
then
puts
it
back
where
it
was
the
ruffling
is
sometimes
very
nice
and
interesting
and
often
gives
the
ruffler
a
good
position
in
the
glorious
company
of
earlier
rufflers
i
should
be
satisfied
with
anything
like
that
things
have
got
to
move
i
want
to
take
some
recent
men
and
put
on
the
shelves
yet
you
do
want
to
waste
work
on
material
which
time
may
show
as
of
transient
value
or
of
none
a
fellow
must
chance
it
who
gives
quickly
gives
twice
i
suppose
that
applies
to
praise
as
well
as
to
money
it
irks
me
to
find
more
praise
bestowed
on
the
even
on
groups
of
secondary
importance
sometimes
just
because
they
are
remote
in
england
perhaps
and
so
can
be
treated
with
an
easy
objectivity
to
dig
in
your
own
day
and
your
own
community
is
harder
but
i
should
feel
it
more
rewarding
but
are
the
english
books
really
better
have
they
more
depth
substance
and
background
possibly
according
to
the
conventions
they
themselves
have
established
and
according
to
the
society
they
depict
well
academe
has
nailed
you
yet
no
and
i
hope
it
wo
i
should
like
to
write
a
whole
book
about
our
new
men
but
do
write
a
thesis
and
then
expect
to
publish
it
with
profit
a
book
that
a
common
enough
expectation
or
temptation
they
turned
away
from
the
lake
terrace
and
the
imposing
cope
randolph
saw
was
in
quite
a
glow
a
generous
interest
had
touched
him
putting
fresh
light
into
his
eyes
and
a
new
vigor
into
his
step
he
had
displayed
a
charming
enthusiasm
and
a
pure
disinterested
one
randolph
under
a
quiet
exterior
was
delighted
he
liked
the
boy
better
than
ever
and
felt
more
than
ever
prompted
to
attach
him
to
himself
how
are
you
pleased
with
your
present
quarters
he
asked
as
they
returned
through
the
botany
court
he
thought
of
the
narrow
couch
the
cover
on
the
deal
table
the
few
coats
and
shoes
they
be
many
behind
that
calico
curtain
none
too
well
replied
cope
i
shall
soon
begin
to
look
for
another
room
i
rather
expect
to
change
about
holiday
time
i
am
thinking
of
making
a
change
too
declared
randolph
why
could
you
better
yourself
asked
cope
in
a
tone
of
surprise
i
never
knew
a
bachelor
to
be
better
fixed
i
need
a
little
wider
margin
of
room
i
can
afford
it
and
ought
to
have
had
it
long
ago
and
i
learn
that
the
lease
of
the
people
i
with
expires
in
the
spring
my
collection
is
growing
and
i
ought
to
have
another
bedroom
think
of
not
being
able
to
put
a
man
up
on
occasion
i
shall
take
a
small
apartment
on
my
own
account
catch
some
oriental
who
is
studying
frogs
legs
or
occidental
theology
and
then
open
house
in
a
moderate
measure
of
course
that
listens
good
as
the
young
fellows
say
replied
cope
a
not
uncommon
ideal
possibly
but
i
glad
that
some
man
now
and
then
is
able
to
realize
it
i
should
hope
to
see
you
there
said
randolph
intently
thank
you
indeed
yes
while
my
time
lasts
but
my
own
lease
is
like
your
landlord
short
next
year
who
knows
where
why
not
here
oh
cope
shrugged
as
if
conscious
of
the
need
of
something
better
and
of
presently
deserving
it
some
big
university
in
the
east
wondered
randolph
to
himself
well
the
transfer
if
it
came
was
still
a
long
way
ahead
as
he
walked
home
to
dinner
he
entertained
himself
by
imagining
his
new
regime
there
would
be
an
alert
intelligent
jap
who
in
some
miraculous
way
could
do
for
him
between
his
studies
there
would
be
a
cozy
where
three
or
four
fellows
could
have
a
snug
little
dinner
with
plenty
of
good
talk
during
it
and
after
it
there
would
be
finally
a
convenient
little
spare
room
wherein
a
young
knight
escaped
from
some
belle
dame
sans
merci
might
lean
his
sword
against
the
wardrobe
prop
his
greaves
along
the
baseboard
lay
his
steel
gauntlets
neatly
on
the
top
of
the
dresser
fold
his
hands
over
the
sheet
of
a
neat
brass
bedstead
and
with
a
satisfied
sigh
of
utter
pass
away
into
sleep
such
facilities
even
if
they
scarcely
equaled
a
chateau
on
the
ridge
or
a
villa
among
the
dunes
might
serve
cope
on
his
own
way
to
dinner
indulged
in
parallel
imaginings
he
saw
a
larger
room
than
his
present
with
more
furniture
and
better
a
bookcase
instead
of
a
shelf
a
closet
and
hot
and
cold
water
in
some
convenient
alcove
a
second
table
with
a
percolator
on
it
at
which
arthur
who
was
a
light
sleeper
and
willingly
an
early
riser
might
indulge
his
knack
for
to
the
advantage
of
them
both
and
arthur
had
the
same
blessed
facility
with
toast
then
his
thoughts
made
an
excursion
toward
randolph
here
was
a
man
who
was
in
business
in
the
city
and
who
was
related
by
marriage
to
the
board
of
trustees
how
soon
might
one
feel
sufficiently
well
acquainted
with
him
to
ask
his
friendly
offices
in
behalf
of
the
the
man
who
might
reasonably
be
expected
the
first
week
in
january
dines
again
and
stays
medora
phillips
social
activities
ran
through
several
social
strata
and
her
entertainments
varied
to
correspond
sometimes
she
contented
herself
with
mere
affairs
which
were
thrown
together
from
material
gathered
within
her
own
household
and
from
the
humbler
walks
of
undergraduate
life
sometimes
she
entertained
literary
celebrities
and
invited
the
head
professors
and
their
wives
to
meet
them
and
two
or
three
times
a
season
she
gave
real
dinners
to
society
summoning
to
ashburn
avenue
from
homes
even
more
architectural
than
her
own
the
banking
and
wholesale
families
whose
incomes
were
derived
from
the
city
but
who
pillared
both
the
university
and
the
many
houses
of
worship
in
churchton
itself
and
sometimes
when
she
passed
over
the
older
generation
of
these
families
in
favor
of
the
younger
her
courses
were
more
liberal
than
churchton
earlier
standards
quite
approved
on
such
formal
occasions
her
three
young
ladies
were
dispensed
with
they
were
encouraged
to
go
to
some
sorority
gathering
or
to
some
on
the
occasion
now
meditated
she
had
another
young
person
in
mind
this
was
the
granddaughter
of
one
of
the
banking
families
the
girl
might
come
along
with
her
father
and
mother
she
was
not
very
pretty
not
very
entertaining
however
phillips
needed
one
girl
and
if
she
were
not
very
attractive
none
the
worse
the
one
girl
was
for
the
one
young
man
the
one
young
man
was
to
be
bertram
cope
our
fond
lady
meant
to
have
him
and
to
show
him
off
sure
that
her
choicest
circle
could
not
but
find
him
as
charming
as
she
herself
did
most
of
us
at
one
time
or
another
have
thrust
forward
our
preferences
in
the
same
confident
way
cope
made
less
of
an
impression
than
his
patroness
had
hoped
for
somehow
his
lithe
youthfulness
his
fine
hair
and
teeth
and
eyes
the
rich
resonance
of
his
voice
counted
for
little
except
perhaps
with
the
granddaughter
the
people
about
him
were
used
to
young
college
men
and
indifferent
to
them
cope
himself
felt
that
he
was
in
a
new
environment
and
a
loftier
one
several
of
these
were
important
people
with
names
familiar
through
the
town
and
beyond
he
employed
a
caution
that
almost
became
inexpressiveness
he
also
found
phillips
a
shade
more
formal
and
stately
than
her
wont
she
herself
in
her
furtive
survey
of
the
board
was
disappointed
to
find
that
he
was
not
telling
perhaps
it
that
girl
she
thought
she
may
be
even
duller
than
i
supposed
but
never
mind
all
would
be
made
right
later
some
music
had
been
arranged
and
there
would
be
an
accompanist
who
would
help
him
do
himself
full
justice
they
enjoy
him
she
thought
confidently
she
had
provided
an
immensity
of
flowers
there
was
an
excess
of
light
both
from
electric
bulbs
and
from
candles
and
there
was
wine
i
think
i
can
have
just
one
kind
for
once
she
had
said
to
herself
i
know
several
houses
where
they
have
two
churchton
or
not
and
at
least
one
where
they
sometimes
have
three
if
this
simple
town
thinks
i
can
put
and
apollinaris
before
such
people
as
these
besides
the
interesting
cope
might
interestingly
refuse
as
the
many
courses
moved
on
cope
smelt
the
flowers
which
were
too
many
and
some
of
them
too
odoriferous
he
blinked
at
the
lights
and
breathed
the
heavy
thickening
air
and
he
took
interestingly
a
few
sips
of
burgundy
for
he
was
now
in
rome
and
no
longer
a
successful
protestant
in
some
lesser
town
of
the
empire
he
had
had
a
hard
close
day
of
it
busy
indoors
with
themes
and
with
general
reading
and
he
recalled
being
glad
that
the
dinner
had
begun
with
reasonable
promptitude
for
he
had
bothered
with
no
lunch
beyond
a
glass
of
milk
and
a
roll
there
had
been
everything
even
to
an
unnecessary
entree
he
laid
down
a
spoon
on
his
plate
glad
that
the
frozen
pudding
of
whatever
sort
was
disposed
of
too
much
of
everything
after
too
little
the
people
opposite
were
far
away
their
murmuring
had
become
a
mumbling
and
he
wished
it
was
all
over
the
granddaughter
at
his
elbow
was
less
rewarding
than
ever
less
justificatory
of
the
effortful
which
he
had
put
forth
with
more
and
more
labor
and
which
he
could
scarcely
put
forth
now
at
all
what
was
it
he
was
meaning
to
do
later
to
sing
absurd
impossible
his
head
ached
he
felt
faint
and
dizzy
we
will
leave
you
gentlemen
to
your
cigars
he
heard
a
distant
voice
saying
and
he
was
conscious
for
an
instant
that
his
hostess
was
looking
down
the
table
at
him
with
a
face
of
startled
concern
do
try
to
lead
him
out
a
deep
voice
said
lay
him
on
the
floor
he
felt
himself
lowered
some
small
rug
was
doubled
and
redoubled
and
placed
under
his
head
a
large
firm
hand
was
laid
to
his
wrist
and
something
a
napkin
dipped
in
a
glass
of
water
and
then
folded
was
put
to
his
forehead
his
pulse
will
come
up
in
a
minute
he
heard
the
same
deep
voice
say
if
he
had
taken
a
step
he
would
have
fainted
altogether
my
poor
dear
boy
whatever
in
the
world
thus
medora
phillips
better
not
be
moved
for
a
little
was
the
next
pronouncement
cope
lay
there
inert
but
reasonably
conscious
of
what
was
going
on
his
eyes
gave
him
no
aid
but
his
ears
were
open
he
heard
the
alarmed
voice
of
medora
phillips
directing
the
disconcerted
maids
and
the
rustle
and
flutter
of
the
garments
of
other
daughters
of
eve
who
had
found
him
interesting
at
last
they
remarked
appreciatively
on
his
pallor
and
one
of
them
said
next
day
before
forgetting
him
altogether
that
with
his
handsome
profile
she
mentioned
especially
his
nose
and
chin
and
with
his
colorlessness
he
looked
for
a
moment
like
an
ancient
cameo
he
knew
now
that
he
was
not
going
to
faint
and
that
he
was
in
better
case
than
he
seemed
in
the
circumstances
he
found
nothing
more
original
to
say
than
i
shall
be
all
right
in
no
time
just
a
touch
of
dizziness
he
was
glad
his
could
stand
inspection
and
hoped
nobody
would
notice
that
his
shoes
had
been
after
a
little
while
he
was
led
away
to
a
couch
in
the
library
the
doctor
was
on
one
side
of
him
and
medora
phillips
on
the
other
soon
he
was
left
alone
to
recuperate
in
the
dark
alone
save
for
one
or
two
brief
fluttery
appearances
by
phillips
herself
who
allowed
the
coffee
to
be
passed
without
any
supervision
on
her
own
part
on
the
second
of
these
visitations
he
found
voice
to
say
i
so
sorry
for
this
and
so
ashamed
i
ca
think
how
it
could
have
happened
he
ashamed
of
course
he
had
broken
up
an
entertainment
pretty
completely
servants
running
about
for
him
when
they
had
enough
to
do
for
the
company
at
large
all
the
smooth
conventions
of
violently
brushed
the
wrong
way
he
had
fallen
by
the
roadside
a
young
fellow
who
had
rather
prided
himself
on
his
health
and
vigor
pitiful
he
was
glad
to
lie
in
the
dark
with
his
eyes
shut
tight
tight
if
he
had
been
fifteen
or
twenty
years
older
he
might
have
taken
it
all
rather
more
lightly
basil
randolph
now
but
randolph
had
not
been
invited
though
his
sister
and
her
husband
were
of
the
company
yet
had
it
been
randolph
he
would
have
smiled
a
wan
smile
and
tried
for
a
mild
joke
conscious
that
he
had
made
an
original
and
picturesque
contribution
to
the
affair
had
broken
the
bland
banality
of
routined
and
had
provided
woman
with
a
mighty
fine
chance
to
minister
and
fuss
a
thing
she
rather
enjoyed
doing
especially
if
a
hapless
helpless
man
had
been
delivered
into
her
hands
as
a
subject
but
there
was
no
such
consolation
for
poor
abashed
cope
he
had
disclosed
himself
for
some
reason
or
other
a
weakling
and
he
had
weakened
at
a
conspicuously
wrong
time
and
in
a
conspicuously
mistaken
place
he
had
hoped
over
the
cigars
and
coffee
to
lay
the
foundation
of
an
acquaintance
with
the
who
was
a
trustee
to
set
up
an
identity
in
this
influential
person
mind
as
a
possible
help
to
the
future
of
arthur
lemoyne
but
the
man
now
in
the
or
the
or
wherever
might
as
well
be
in
the
next
state
there
came
a
slight
patter
of
rain
on
the
near
his
head
he
began
to
wonder
how
he
was
to
get
home
meanwhile
in
the
among
the
ladies
phillips
was
anxiously
asking
was
the
room
too
warm
could
the
wine
have
been
too
much
for
him
and
out
in
the
itself
one
man
said
heaven
knows
just
how
they
live
and
another
or
what
they
eat
or
eat
and
a
third
or
just
how
hard
these
young
beginners
are
driven
ought
he
to
go
out
doctor
asked
phillips
in
a
whisper
appearing
in
the
door
he
might
better
stay
if
he
can
replied
the
authority
who
happened
to
be
at
the
nearer
end
of
the
table
of
course
he
can
she
returned
of
course
there
was
a
room
for
him
when
the
party
finally
reassembled
in
the
cope
had
disappeared
phillips
could
now
enlarge
on
his
attractiveness
as
a
singer
and
could
safely
assure
them
what
she
herself
believed
that
they
had
lost
a
really
charming
experience
if
you
could
only
have
heard
him
that
sunday
she
concluded
cope
had
said
of
course
i
can
get
home
perfectly
well
and
it
a
shame
for
me
to
be
putting
you
out
this
way
and
so
on
and
on
the
things
you
yourself
would
have
said
in
the
circumstances
but
he
said
them
with
no
particular
spirit
and
was
glad
as
he
walked
uncertainly
up
stairs
that
he
had
not
far
to
go
phillips
indeed
had
a
room
for
him
she
had
rooms
there
was
the
chintz
chamber
on
the
third
floor
where
the
irish
poet
who
seemed
not
to
expect
very
much
for
himself
had
been
put
and
there
was
the
larger
handsomer
chamber
on
the
second
floor
where
the
hindoo
philosopher
who
had
loomed
up
big
and
important
through
a
vague
oriental
atmosphere
had
been
installed
in
state
it
was
a
louis
quinze
room
and
the
bed
had
a
kind
of
silken
canopy
and
a
great
deal
too
much
in
the
way
of
bolsters
and
lace
coverings
it
was
thought
that
the
hindoo
judging
from
the
report
of
the
maid
next
morning
had
been
moved
by
some
ascetic
impulse
to
sleep
not
in
the
bed
but
on
the
floor
beside
it
this
was
the
room
now
destined
for
cope
surely
one
flight
of
stairs
was
enough
but
there
must
be
no
further
practice
of
asceticism
least
of
all
by
a
man
who
was
really
ill
so
phillips
snatching
a
moment
from
her
guests
herself
saw
the
maid
remove
the
lace
and
coverlet
and
turn
down
the
sheets
and
set
the
on
the
stand
beside
the
reading
lamp
do
get
up
a
moment
earlier
than
you
feel
like
doing
she
said
at
the
door
breakfast
is
one
of
my
busy
days
replied
cope
wanly
goldsmith
sheridan
well
we
have
other
in
the
house
you
know
at
then
if
you
must
if
you
please
thank
you
by
the
time
phillips
had
returned
to
her
guests
the
first
of
the
limousines
was
standing
before
the
house
its
wet
top
shone
under
an
electric
globe
her
own
car
meanwhile
obdurately
reposed
in
its
garage
presently
a
second
limousine
joined
the
first
and
a
third
the
second
and
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
her
guests
were
well
on
their
way
to
dispersal
she
bade
them
all
goodnight
in
the
best
of
good
humor
you
never
before
had
quite
such
an
evening
as
this
i
sure
she
said
with
great
gaiety
is
it
wonderful
how
she
took
it
all
said
one
lady
to
another
on
the
back
seat
of
her
car
anything
like
that
would
have
thrown
me
off
completely
the
other
lady
laughed
amusedly
she
often
found
our
medora
great
fun
meanwhile
cope
up
stairs
was
sinking
deeper
and
deeper
into
his
big
wide
overupholstered
bed
and
as
his
body
sank
his
spirit
sank
with
it
he
felt
poor
unimportant
ill
at
ease
in
especial
he
felt
greatly
subordinated
he
wished
that
he
might
have
capitulated
to
a
man
then
the
mystery
of
handsome
houses
and
of
handsome
furnishings
came
to
harass
him
such
things
were
everywhere
how
were
they
got
how
were
they
kept
should
he
himself
ever
but
no
nothing
ahead
for
years
even
in
the
most
favorable
of
circumstances
save
an
assistant
professorship
with
its
inconceivably
modest
emoluments
and
medora
phillips
in
the
stir
of
getting
her
guests
out
of
the
house
had
her
first
vision
of
him
as
sinking
off
to
sleep
somehow
or
other
his
fine
straight
yellow
hair
retained
its
backward
sweep
with
no
impairment
by
reason
of
turnings
and
tossings
his
clear
profile
continued
to
keep
itself
disengaged
from
any
depression
in
the
pillows
his
slender
hands
were
laid
in
quiet
symmetry
over
the
wide
edge
of
the
coverlet
a
decorous
unperturbed
young
van
eyck
carpaccio
cope
came
down
to
breakfast
a
little
pale
a
little
shamefaced
but
he
felt
pretty
well
revived
and
he
made
up
in
excess
of
speech
and
action
what
he
essentially
lacked
in
spirit
phillips
descended
as
early
as
the
three
girls
earlier
in
fact
than
hortense
who
entered
informally
through
the
butler
pantry
and
apparently
in
full
possession
of
last
night
facts
carolyn
inquired
civilly
after
his
condition
amy
leffingwell
with
her
blue
eyes
intent
upon
him
expressed
concern
and
sympathy
hortense
with
her
lips
closely
shut
in
a
satirical
smile
said
nothing
at
all
a
possible
exhibition
of
which
gave
her
aunt
some
measure
of
solicitude
it
was
not
always
well
when
she
talked
and
it
was
not
always
well
when
she
kept
silent
phillips
pressed
the
toast
upon
him
and
recommended
the
he
took
both
with
satisfaction
and
a
second
cup
of
coffee
with
that
he
felt
he
could
easily
walk
to
his
and
the
walk
itself
in
the
fresh
morning
air
would
brace
him
further
for
his
hours
of
routine
with
his
students
what
a
regular
nuisance
i
made
of
myself
he
said
on
leaving
the
house
oh
have
you
just
exclaimed
phillips
joyously
your
name
as
an
entertainer
will
be
all
over
town
i
sure
you
gave
some
of
those
poky
people
a
real
touch
of
novelty
amy
leffingwell
was
in
the
front
hall
at
the
same
time
with
her
they
were
going
the
same
way
to
substantially
the
same
place
to
meet
about
the
same
hour
in
the
day
schedule
they
went
along
the
street
together
the
morning
air
was
brisk
and
cool
after
last
night
shower
like
the
trees
under
which
they
passed
it
gave
the
first
decided
intimation
of
autumn
they
set
off
at
a
lively
pace
toward
the
college
towers
and
the
lake
cope
was
soon
sailing
along
with
his
head
high
his
trim
square
shoulders
much
in
action
and
his
feet
throwing
themselves
spiritedly
here
and
there
amy
who
was
not
very
tall
kept
up
as
well
as
she
could
this
is
too
fast
for
you
she
asked
presently
no
but
it
may
be
a
little
too
fast
for
you
excuse
me
i
never
learned
to
keep
pace
with
a
woman
but
as
for
myself
i
never
felt
better
in
my
life
every
yard
toward
the
good
old
lake
the
wind
was
coming
down
from
the
north
in
a
great
sweep
makes
me
feel
finer
he
slowed
up
appreciably
oh
not
for
me
she
said
in
deprecation
i
like
a
brisk
morning
walk
as
well
as
anybody
did
you
sing
at
all
she
asked
not
a
note
they
put
the
soft
pedal
on
me
they
me
he
amended
in
deference
to
her
own
branch
of
the
profession
we
came
in
by
the
side
door
about
half
past
nine
it
was
a
dull
meeting
i
listened
for
you
somebody
was
playing
cope
gave
a
sly
smile
it
must
have
been
the
poor
disappointed
woman
who
was
to
have
accompanied
me
she
had
had
a
list
of
three
or
four
of
my
things
to
run
them
over
in
her
own
album
i
suppose
think
just
how
disappointed
she
must
have
been
to
find
that
she
had
the
whole
field
to
herself
oh
musicians
even
we
poor
despised
professionals
are
not
all
like
that
if
it
had
been
arranged
for
me
to
accompany
you
with
an
obbligato
i
should
have
been
pleased
if
opportunity
had
failed
me
your
contribution
would
have
been
more
important
than
hers
and
your
substitution
for
my
failure
would
have
given
added
interest
the
talk
having
reached
the
zone
of
arid
compliment
tended
to
languish
they
had
now
reached
learning
side
of
the
and
rills
in
the
great
morning
flood
of
the
scholastic
life
were
beginning
to
gather
about
them
and
to
unite
in
a
rolling
stream
which
flowed
toward
the
campus
two
or
three
streets
on
the
pair
separated
she
to
her
work
he
to
his
for
him
the
walk
had
been
a
nothing
in
particular
he
would
a
little
have
preferred
taking
it
alone
for
her
it
had
been
despite
the
low
level
of
expressiveness
reached
on
either
side
a
privilege
which
had
been
curtailed
much
too
soon
meanwhile
back
in
the
house
hortense
was
detailing
the
events
of
the
previous
evening
to
joe
foster
the
general
access
of
activity
on
the
morning
after
had
made
it
desirable
that
she
help
with
his
breakfast
she
went
at
it
with
a
will
why
she
said
as
foster
sat
at
his
coffee
boiled
egg
and
toast
he
keeled
over
like
a
baby
hum
said
foster
darkly
it
was
as
if
a
shaping
ideal
had
dissipated
or
as
if
a
trace
of
weakness
in
one
seemingly
so
young
and
strong
was
not
altogether
unacceptable
as
a
source
of
consolation
however
cope
at
half
past
four
that
afternoon
was
on
the
faculty
with
a
racquet
in
his
hand
but
one
set
was
enough
i
seem
to
be
a
day
ahead
of
my
schedule
he
said
pulling
out
and
strolling
along
homeward
makes
an
two
or
three
days
later
randolph
put
a
book
of
essays
in
his
pocket
and
went
round
to
spend
an
hour
with
joseph
foster
foster
sat
in
his
wheeled
chair
in
his
own
room
he
was
knitting
the
past
year
or
two
had
brought
into
countenance
for
men
and
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
put
a
few
hanks
of
yarn
into
shape
useful
for
himself
he
might
not
have
full
command
of
his
limbs
nor
of
his
eyes
but
he
did
have
full
command
of
his
fingers
he
had
begun
to
knit
socks
for
his
own
use
and
even
a
muffler
in
the
hope
that
on
some
occasion
during
the
coming
months
he
might
get
outside
as
randolph
entered
foster
looked
up
from
under
his
green
shade
with
an
expression
of
perplexity
have
i
dropped
a
stitch
here
or
not
he
asked
i
wish
you
knew
something
about
knitting
i
do
like
to
call
medora
or
one
of
the
girls
away
up
here
to
straighten
me
out
look
what
do
you
think
they
count
all
right
said
randolph
and
he
sat
down
on
the
couch
opposite
i
brought
a
book
i
hope
it
poetry
said
foster
with
a
fierce
promptness
i
hope
it
about
adonis
or
thammuz
whose
mishap
lebanon
set
all
the
syrian
females
i
could
stand
a
lot
more
of
that
or
perhaps
i
could
why
joe
what
gone
wrong
i
suppose
you
know
that
your
young
friend
got
up
a
great
for
us
the
other
evening
yes
i
heard
something
about
it
he
looked
at
foster
drawn
face
and
heard
with
surprise
the
rasping
note
in
his
voice
was
it
as
bad
as
that
foster
drew
his
shade
down
farther
over
his
eyes
and
clashed
his
needles
together
i
remember
how
when
i
was
in
florence
we
went
out
to
a
religious
festival
one
evening
at
some
small
near
by
this
was
twenty
years
ago
when
i
travel
there
was
a
kind
of
grotto
in
the
church
under
the
high
altar
and
in
the
grotto
was
a
figure
of
a
dead
man
carved
and
painted
and
covered
with
wounds
and
round
that
figure
half
the
women
and
girls
of
the
town
were
collected
stroking
kissing
adonis
all
over
again
oh
come
joe
do
get
morbid
foster
lifted
one
shoulder
well
the
young
fellow
began
by
roaring
through
the
house
like
a
bull
of
bashan
and
he
ended
by
toppling
over
like
a
little
wobbly
calf
he
spoke
like
a
man
who
had
imagined
a
full
measure
of
physical
powers
and
had
envied
them
had
been
exasperated
by
the
exuberant
presentation
of
them
had
felt
a
series
of
contradictory
emotions
when
they
had
seemed
to
fail
it
was
only
a
moment
of
dizziness
said
randolph
i
imagine
he
was
fairly
himself
next
day
well
i
heard
too
much
about
it
medora
came
up
here
and
need
we
go
into
that
there
were
plenty
more
to
help
foster
went
on
doggedly
one
dear
creature
who
was
old
enough
to
be
more
cautious
spilt
water
down
the
whole
front
of
her
dress
i
expect
said
randolph
that
the
poor
chap
has
been
overworked
or
careless
about
his
meals
or
worried
in
his
classes
for
he
may
not
be
fully
settled
in
his
new
place
or
some
emotional
strain
may
have
set
itself
up
i
vote
for
the
emotional
strain
said
foster
bluntly
a
guess
in
the
dark
commented
randolph
and
paused
he
himself
knew
little
enough
of
cope
as
a
complex
he
had
met
him
but
a
few
times
and
could
not
associate
him
with
his
unknown
background
he
knew
next
to
nothing
of
cope
family
his
connections
his
intimates
his
early
associations
and
experiences
nor
had
he
greatly
bestirred
himself
to
learn
he
had
done
little
more
than
go
to
a
library
in
the
city
and
turn
over
the
leaves
of
the
freeford
directory
this
publication
like
most
of
those
dealing
with
the
smaller
cities
gave
separately
the
names
of
all
the
members
of
a
family
and
repetitions
of
the
same
address
helped
toward
the
arrangement
of
these
individuals
disposed
alphabetically
into
family
groups
freeford
had
no
great
number
of
copes
and
several
of
them
lived
at
cedar
street
elm
pine
locust
cedar
had
thought
randolph
the
regular
set
and
one
of
the
good
streets
he
surmised
but
rather
far
out
cedar
he
repeated
and
thought
of
lebanon
and
the
miltonic
adonis
of
these
various
copes
cope
david
bookpr
might
be
the
father
unless
cope
leverett
mgr
were
the
right
man
if
the
former
he
was
employed
by
the
martin
graves
furniture
company
and
the
martins
were
probably
important
people
who
lived
far
out
and
handsomely
one
might
guess
on
a
prospect
avenue
then
there
was
cope
miss
rosalys
schooltchr
same
address
as
david
she
was
likely
his
daughter
h
randolph
had
thought
these
pickings
are
scanty
enough
anatomical
reconstruction
for
and
now
he
was
thinking
as
he
sat
opposite
foster
if
i
had
only
picked
up
another
bone
or
two
i
might
really
have
put
together
the
domestic
organism
yet
why
should
i
trouble
it
would
all
be
plain
humdrum
prose
no
doubt
glamour
does
spread
indefinitely
and
then
men
brothers
well
asked
foster
sharply
are
you
mooning
medora
sat
in
the
same
place
yesterday
and
she
talked
for
awhile
too
and
then
fell
into
a
moonstruck
silence
what
it
all
about
randolph
came
out
of
his
reverie
oh
i
was
just
hoping
the
poor
boy
was
back
on
his
pins
all
right
again
then
he
dropped
back
into
thought
he
was
devising
an
outing
designed
to
restore
cope
to
condition
if
cope
could
arrange
for
a
free
saturday
they
might
contrive
a
from
friday
afternoon
to
monday
morning
it
was
too
late
for
the
north
and
too
late
for
the
opposite
michigan
shore
but
there
was
down
state
itself
where
the
days
grew
warmer
and
the
autumn
younger
the
farther
south
one
went
there
was
a
trip
down
a
certain
historic
river
historic
as
our
rivers
went
and
admirably
scenic
always
he
recalled
an
exceptional
hotel
on
one
of
its
best
reaches
one
overrun
in
midsummer
but
doubtless
quiet
at
this
season
it
stood
in
the
midst
of
some
striking
cliffs
and
gorges
and
possibly
one
of
the
little
was
in
commission
or
could
be
induced
to
run
foster
dropped
his
muffler
pettishly
read
if
you
wo
talk

can
talk
all
right
returned
randolph
in
fact
i
have
a
bit
of
news
for
you

is
it
i
going
to
move
foster
peered
out
from
under
his
shade
move
what
for
i
thought
you

all
right
where
you
are
all
right
enough
except

a
house

my
own

a
hand

and
then

so
that
will
give
me
a
chance
to
wear
this
muffler
after
all
so
it
will
well
be
a
little
more
cordial
you
expect
to
see
your
friends
you
of
course
that
what
it
for
have
i
got
to
exert
myself
he
added
to
be
cordial
with
what
the
neighborhood
oh
this
one
substantially
the
next
street
from
where
i
am
now
housekeeper
i
think
i
have
a
jap
alone
at
first
dinners
a
few
small
perhaps
mixed
parties
not
at
the
beginning
anyhow
oh
bachelor
hall
about
that
foster
readjusted
his
shade
and
drove
his
needles
into
his
ball
of
yarn
complete
new
outfit
well
i
have
some
things
in
storage
how
about
the
people
you
with
now
their
lease
is
up
in
the
spring
they
may
go
on
they
may
not
the
time
to
change
foster
drew
out
his
needles
again
and
fell
to
work
you
ought
to
have
seen
hortense
the
next
morning
she
put
my
tray
on
the
table
and
then
went
down
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
or
it
sounded
like
that
she
was
fainting
away
at
dinner
she
said
she
found
it
amusing
i
do
know
she
found
it
returned
foster
shortly
if
ever
do
anything
like
that
at
your
house
run
me
home
not
if
it
raining
i
shall
be
able
to
tuck
you
away
somewhere
do
i
never
asked
to
be
a
centre
of
interest
well
returned
randolph
merely
and
fell
silent
foster
resumed
work
with
some
excess
of
vigor
and
presently
got
into
a
snarl
dammit
he
exclaimed
have
i
dropped
another
randolph
leaned
over
to
examine
the
work
something
wrong
well
let
it
go
enough
for
now
read
there
followed
a
half
hour
of
historical
essay
during
which
foster
a
few
times
surreptitiously
fingered
his
needles
and
yarn
shall
you
have
a
at
your
new
diggings
he
asked
after
a
while
if
two
can
be
said
to
make
a
circle
and
if
you
will
really
come
i
coming
but
i
never
understood
that
only
two
points
could
establish
a
circle
three
anyway
circle
exclaimed
randolph
do
worry
the
word
to
death
he
went
away
presently
and
as
he
walked
his
thoughts
returned
to
indian
rock
the
excursion
seemed
a
valid
undertaking
at
an
advantageous
time
and
he
could
easily
spare
a
couple
of
days
from
the
formation
of
his
new
establishment
he
called
on
cope
that
evening
cope
felt
sure
he
could
clear
things
for
saturday
and
expressed
pleasure
at
the
general
prospect
he
happened
to
be
writing
to
lemoyne
that
evening
and
passed
along
his
pleasure
at
the
prospect
to
his
friend
a
few
jaunts
outings
or
interludes
of
that
kind
together
with
his
week
at
his
home
in
freeford
over
christmas
would
agreeably
help
fill
in
the
time
before
arthur
own
arrival
in
january
randolph
received
cope
response
with
gratification
it
was
pleasant
to
feel
oneself
acceptable
to
a
younger
man
in
the
intervals
between
his
early
looking
at
rugs
and
napery
he
collected
timetables
and
folders
made
inquiries
and
had
some
correspondence
with
the
manager
of
the
admirable
hotel
he
had
a
fondness
for
hostelries
just
before
or
just
after
the
active
season
it
was
a
pleasure
to
breakfast
or
dine
in
some
far
corner
of
a
large
and
almost
empty
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
stroll
through
those
gorges
which
would
be
reasonably
certain
to
be
free
from
litter
and
to
perch
on
the
crags
which
would
be
reasonably
certain
to
be
free
from
picnic
parties
it
would
be
agreeable
also
to
sleep
in
a
chamber
far
from
town
noises
and
grimes
with
few
honks
from
late
excursionists
and
but
little
early
morning
clatter
from
a
diminished
staff
and
the
river
boats
were
still
running
on
sunday
it
will
brace
him
for
the
rest
of
his
fall
term
thought
randolph
and
me
for
my
confounded
shopping
and
during
some
one
of
our
or
rambles
i
shall
tell
him
of
my
plans
for
the
winter
the
departure
it
was
agreed
upon
should
take
place
late
on
friday
afternoon
on
friday
at
half
past
eleven
randolph
at
his
office
in
the
city
received
a
call
from
churchton
cope
announced
with
a
breathless
particularity
not
altogether
disassociated
from
gaucherie
that
he
should
be
unable
to
go
some
unexpected
work
had
been
suddenly
thrown
upon
him
he
rather
thought
that
one
or
two
of
his
family
might
be
coming
to
town
for
over
sunday
the
telephone
as
a
conveyor
of
unwelcome
message
strikes
a
medium
between
the
letter
by
mail
and
the
interview
if
it
does
not
quite
give
chance
for
the
studied
guardedness
and
calculated
plausibility
of
the
one
it
at
least
obviates
some
of
the
risk
involved
in
personal
presence
and
in
the
introduction
of
contradictory
evidence
often
contributed
by
manner
and
by
facial
expression
and
a
long
distance
interview
must
be
brief
at
least
there
can
be
no
surprise
no
indignation
if
it
is
made
so
very
well
said
randolph
in
reply
to
cope
hurried
and
indistinct
words
i
sorry
he
added
and
the
brief
talk
was
over
you
are
feeling
all
right
i
hope
he
would
have
added
as
the
result
of
an
afterthought
but
the
connection
was
broken
randolph
left
the
instrument
he
felt
dashed
a
good
deal
disappointed
and
a
little
hurt
he
took
two
or
three
folders
from
a
and
dropped
them
into
a
well
the
boy
doubtless
had
his
reasons
but
a
single
good
one
frankly
put
forth
would
have
been
better
than
duplicate
or
multiple
reasons
he
hoped
that
on
sunday
a
cold
drizzle
rather
than
a
flood
of
sunlight
might
fall
upon
the
autumn
foliage
of
indian
rock
and
he
would
turn
to
good
account
by
looking
for
an
hour
or
two
at
china
sunday
afternoon
was
gorgeously
bright
and
autumnal
in
churchton
whatever
it
may
have
been
along
the
middle
reaches
of
the
illinois
river
and
at
about
four
randolph
found
himself
in
front
of
medora
phillips
house
medora
and
her
young
ladies
were
out
strolling
as
was
inevitable
on
such
a
day
but
in
her
library
he
found
foster
lying
on
a
couch
the
same
piece
of
furniture
which
at
a
critical
juncture
had
comforted
cope
peter
brought
me
down
said
the
cripple
i
thought
i
rather
look
at
the
backs
of
books
than
at
the
fronts
of
all
those
tedious
pictures
besides
i
beginning
to
practice
for
my
call
at
your
new
quarters
then
with
a
sudden
afterthought
why
i
understood
you
were
going
somewhere
out
of
town
what
prevented
well
i
changed
my
plans
i
needed
a
little
more
time
for
my
i
was
looking
yesterday
at
some
for
your
use
am
wondering
in
fact
if
phillips
could
arrange
to
give
me
the
benefit
of
her
taste
or
tuesday
she
likes
to
shop
replied
foster
and
taste
is
her
strong
suit
i
speak
to
her
she
gone
off
to
some
meeting
or
other
is
this
just
the
afternoon
to
be
spending
indoors
he
commented
brusquely
what
a
day
it
would
be
for
the
country
he
added
sending
his
ineffectual
glance
in
the
direction
of
randolph
face
we
churchtonians
must
take
what
we
can
get
randolph
replied
with
an
attempt
at
indifference
our
in
is
everything
but
there
are
times
when
it
must
be
made
to
serve
foster
said
nothing
silent
conjecture
seemingly
was
offered
him
as
his
part
entertains
several
cope
excuse
involving
the
expected
visit
of
a
relative
may
not
have
been
altogether
sincere
but
it
received
within
a
week
or
so
the
substantial
backing
of
actuality
a
relative
came
she
was
an
aunt
his
father
sister
and
she
came
at
the
suggestion
of
a
concerned
landlady
this
person
made
anxious
by
a
languid
young
man
who
had
begged
off
from
his
classes
and
who
was
likely
to
need
more
attention
than
her
scanty
margin
of
leisure
could
grant
had
even
suggested
a
hospital
while
yet
it
was
easy
for
him
to
reach
one
though
cope
meant
to
leave
her
soon
it
did
not
suit
him
to
leave
her
quite
as
soon
as
this
and
so
aunt
harriet
came
in
from
freeford
to
look
the
situation
over
and
to
lend
a
hand
if
need
be
she
spent
two
nights
in
a
vacant
chamber
at
transient
rates
was
grudgingly
allowed
to
prepare
his
slops
as
he
called
them
in
the
kitchen
and
had
time
to
satisfy
herself
that
after
all
nothing
very
serious
was
the
matter
randolph
did
not
meet
this
relative
but
he
heard
about
her
and
her
coming
as
a
sort
of
family
representative
helped
him
still
further
in
his
picture
of
the
of
a
household
a
father
held
closely
to
office
or
warehouse
his
own
or
some
one
else
a
sister
confined
to
her
a
mother
who
found
the
demands
of
the
domestic
routine
too
exacting
even
to
allow
a
trip
to
town
and
a
brother
randolph
added
this
figure
quite
gratuitously
out
of
an
active
imagination
and
a
determined
desire
not
to
put
any
of
the
circle
to
the
test
of
a
personal
encounter
and
a
brother
who
was
perhaps
off
somewhere
on
the
road
the
one
who
met
aunt
harriet
was
medora
phillips
and
the
meeting
was
brief
medora
had
heard
from
amy
leffingwell
of
cope
absence
from
his
she
herself
became
concerned
she
felt
more
or
less
responsible
and
possibly
a
bit
next
time
she
said
i
shall
try
to
have
the
ventilation
right
and
i
think
that
after
this
i
shall
keep
to
birch
beer
medora
called
up
amy
at
the
one
afternoon
at
about
four
she
assumed
that
the
day
work
was
over
told
amy
she
was
going
around
to
see
bertram
cope
and
asked
her
to
go
with
her
you
may
act
as
my
chaperon
she
said
for
who
knows
where
or
how
i
shall
find
him
as
they
neared
the
house
a
colored
man
came
out
carrying
a
small
trunk
to
a
surrey
what
is
he
going
said
medora
with
a
start
well
anyway
we
in
time
to
say
then
what
the
matter
jasper
she
asked
having
now
recognized
the
driver
and
his
conveyance
got
a
lady
who
gettin
away
on
the
four
oh
said
medora
with
a
gasp
of
reassurance
cope
aunt
said
to
him
up
stairs
and
was
now
putting
on
her
gloves
in
the
lower
hall
in
the
company
of
the
landlady
medora
appraised
the
visitor
as
a
person
one
of
some
substance
and
standing
in
her
own
community
marriage
perhaps
had
provided
her
with
means
and
leisure
she
had
been
willing
to
subordinate
herself
to
a
university
town
apprehended
as
a
social
organism
and
she
now
seemed
inclined
to
accept
with
docility
any
observations
made
by
a
confident
urbanite
with
a
fair
degree
of
verve
these
young
men
said
medora
dashingly
are
too
careless
and
proud
proud
asked
the
other
she
felt
clearly
enough
that
her
nephew
had
been
careless
but
pride
is
not
often
acknowledged
among
the
members
of
an
ordinary
domestic
circle
they
all
mind
medora
went
on
with
no
lapse
of
momentum
she
knew
she
must
work
in
brief
broad
effects
the
surrey
was
waiting
and
the
train
would
not
delay
they
sometimes
forget
that
their
intellectual
efforts
must
rest
after
all
on
a
good
sensible
physical
basis
they
must
scorn
the
body
the
departing
visitor
gave
a
quick
little
sigh
of
relief
the
views
of
this
fashionable
and
forthputting
woman
were
in
accord
with
her
own
after
all
well
i
told
bert
she
said
buttoning
her
second
glove
that
he
had
better
take
all
his
meals
in
one
place
and
at
regular
hours
told
him
his
health
is
of
just
as
much
account
as
his
students
and
their
studies
she
seemed
gratified
that
on
an
important
point
she
had
reached
unanimity
with
an
influential
person
who
was
to
remain
behind
and
she
got
away
without
too
long
delaying
the
muddy
surrey
and
the
ungroomed
sorrel
medora
phillips
looked
after
her
with
a
grimace
think
of
calling
him
cope
when
advised
came
down
in
a
sort
of
bathrobe
which
he
made
do
duty
as
a
he
took
the
stairs
in
a
rapid
run
produced
an
emphatic
smile
for
the
parlor
threshold
and
put
a
good
measure
of
energy
into
his
handshakes
mighty
good
of
you
to
call
he
said
to
phillips
mighty
good
of
you
to
call
he
said
to
amy
leffingwell
well
he
was
on
his
feet
then
no
chance
to
feel
anxiously
the
brow
of
a
poor
boy
in
bed
or
to
ask
if
the
window
was
right
or
if
he
like
a
sip
of
water
life
little
disappointments
to
amy
leffingwell
he
seemed
pale
and
she
felt
him
as
glad
to
sit
down
at
once
in
the
third
and
last
chair
the
little
room
offered
she
noticed
too
an
inkstain
on
his
right
forefinger
and
judged
that
the
daily
grind
of
was
going
on
in
spite
of
everything
did
you
meet
my
aunt
before
she
got
away
he
asked
we
did
said
medora
and
we
are
going
to
add
our
advice
to
hers
that
very
nice
of
you
he
rejoined
flattered
but
within
a
couple
of
months
he
went
on
with
a
lowered
voice
and
an
eye
on
the
parlor
door
i
shall
be
living
in
a
different
place
and
in
quite
a
different
way
until
then
he
shrugged
his
shrug
was
meant
to
include
the
scanty
unpretending
furnishings
of
the
room
and
also
the
rough
casual
fare
provided
by
many
houses
of
entertainment
out
of
present
sight
i
almost
feel
like
taking
you
in
myself
declared
medora
boldly
that
still
nicer
of
you
he
said
very
promptly
and
with
a
reinforcement
of
his
smile
but
i
on
the
and
pretty
soon
everything
will
come
out
as
smooth
as
silk
i
shall
have
ten
days
at
home
for
the
holidays
then
after
that
the
new
dispensation
amy
leffingwell
tempered
her
look
of
general
commiseration
with
a
slight
lapse
into
relief
there
was
no
compelling
reason
why
she
should
have
commiserated
perhaps
it
all
came
from
a
desire
to
indulge
in
an
abandonment
to
gentleness
and
pity
do
you
know
said
cope
with
a
sort
of
embarrassed
laugh
i
feel
as
if
i
were
letting
myself
become
the
focus
of
interest
ought
i
to
do
something
to
make
the
talk
less
personal
he
glanced
about
the
meagre
little
room
it
gave
no
cue
i
sure
amy
and
i
are
satisfied
with
the
present
subject
returned
medora
but
cope
rose
and
gathered
his
bathrobe
or
about
him
wait
a
moment
i
have
some
photographs
i
can
show
you
several
of
them
came
only
yesterday
i
bring
them
down
as
soon
as
he
had
disappeared
into
the
hall
phillips
gave
a
slight
smile
and
said
quickly
for
heaven
sake
amy
do
look
so
concerned
and
mournful
and
sympathetic
anybody
might
think
that
instead
of
your
being
my
chaperon
i
was
yours
he
does
look
at
all
well
said
amy
defensively
he
might
look
better
but
we
ca
pity
a
young
man
too
openly
pity
is
akin
to
embarrassment
for
the
pitied
cope
came
down
stairs
the
second
time
at
a
lesser
pace
he
carried
a
sheaf
of
photographs
some
were
large
and
were
regularly
mounted
others
were
but
the
informal
products
of
he
drew
up
his
chair
nearer
to
theirs
and
began
to
spread
his
pictures
over
the
gray
and
brown
pattern
on
his
lap
you
know
i
was
teaching
last
year
at
winnebago
he
said
here
are
some
pictures
of
the
place
science
hall
he
began
passing
them
those
fellows
on
the
front
steps
must
be
a
graduating
class
the
cathedral
he
continued
and
i
think
that
somewhere
or
other
i
have
a
of
the
choir
sisterhood
house
he
went
on
two
or
three
of
them
standing
out
in
front
sisterhood
asked
phillips
with
interest
what
do
they
do
cope
paused
what
do
they
do
indeed
well
for
one
thing
they
decorate
the
altar
easter
harvest
home
and
so
on
that
is
much
that
does
take
a
house
well
i
suppose
they
visit
and
teach
sort
of
neighborhood
centre
headquarters
most
of
them
i
believe
live
at
home
dear
me
is
winnebago
large
enough
to
require
do
drive
me
so
i
suppose
they
want
to
tone
in
with
the
cathedral
as
a
special
institution
you
know
some
tracts
of
our
great
land
are
rather
drab
and
vacant
remember
color
stir
and
distinction
you
understand
is
winnebago
ritualistic
not
very
while
i
was
there
a
young
an
offshoot
from
the
cathedral
started
up
a
new
parish
in
one
of
the
industrial
outskirts
he
was
quite
earnest
and
eloquent
and
put
up
a
fine
service
but
nobody
except
his
own
father
and
mother
went
to
hear
him
preach
phillips
returned
to
the
sisterhood
house
are
they
nice
girls
she
asked
acutely
oh
i
guess
so
i
met
two
or
three
of
them
nice
girls
yes
just
trying
to
be
a
little
different
here
the
and
some
of
the
fellows
in
their
some
too
can
you
sail
asked
amy
she
had
the
in
one
hand
and
now
took
the
in
the
other
she
studied
both
pictures
intently
for
both
were
small
and
crowded
why
i
have
all
the
theory
and
some
of
the
practice
those
small
inland
lakes
are
tricky
though
probably
no
worse
than
ours
said
phillips
do
help
poor
amy
she
went
on
you
in
either
of
these
groups
no
did
i
tell
you
i
was
trying
to
get
away
from
the
personal
not
in
any
of
these
pictures
amy
unconsciously
let
both
as
if
they
held
no
particular
interest
after
all
and
the
hand
into
which
the
next
photograph
was
put
gave
it
but
lukewarm
welcome
mixed
in
with
these
general
subjects
were
several
of
a
more
personal
nature
groups
of
twos
and
threes
and
a
number
of
single
figures
one
face
and
figure
as
phillips
presently
came
to
notice
occurred
again
and
again
in
various
attitudes
and
costumes
it
was
a
young
man
of
cope
own
age
or
perhaps
two
or
three
years
older
he
was
of
cope
own
height
but
slightly
heavier
with
a
possible
tendency
to
plumpness
the
best
of
the
photographs
made
him
dark
with
black
wavy
hair
and
in
some
cases
where
sunlight
did
not
distort
his
expression
he
indulged
a
determined
sort
of
smile
he
figured
once
all
by
himself
in
choir
vestments
again
all
by
himself
in
rowing
toggery
a
third
time
still
by
himself
in
a
costume
whose
vague
inaccuracy
suggested
a
character
in
amateur
theatricals
who
is
this
inquired
phillips
with
the
last
of
these
in
hand
cope
was
prompt
but
vague
oh
that
a
chum
of
mine
up
there
he
belongs
to
a
dramatic
club
they
give
school
for
scandal
and
and
well
more
modern
things
they
have
to
wear
all
sorts
of
togs
and
here
he
is
again
and
here
and
here
shuffling
still
another
picture
into
view
yes
he
fond
of
costume
is
he
very
versatile
returned
cope
lightly
and
briefly
clothes
to
correspond
phillips
began
to
peer
again
at
the
picture
of
the
is
he
here
too
yes
with
the
first
tenors
there
you
have
him
third
from
the
left
just
behind
that
row
of
little
devils
in
surplices
you
and
he
sing
together
sometimes
when
we
together
watch
and
la
tromba
and
oh
heavens
said
cope
he
threw
up
his
head
quite
spiritedly
there
was
now
more
color
in
his
cheeks
more
sparkle
in
his
eyes
more
vibration
in
his
voice
amy
looked
at
him
with
a
vanishing
pity
and
a
growing
admiration
let
us
fellows
be
of
our
own
day
and
generation
he
added
willingly
said
phillips
but
my
husband
was
fond
of
watch
i
heard
him
sing
in
it
before
we
were
married
shall
i
ever
hear
you
sing
together
she
asked
possibly
he
is
coming
down
here
early
in
january
to
look
after
me
after
you
phillips
reviewed
the
photographs
once
more
i
imagine
you
may
sometimes
have
to
look
after
him
cope
sobered
a
little
sometimes
he
acknowledged
we
shall
look
after
each
other
he
amended
we
are
going
to
live
together
oh
then
he
is
coming
to
you
been
a
long
time
in
reaching
the
point
and
why
do
you
say
when
i
ask
about
your
singing
together
are
you
coming
to
my
house
i
withdraw
the
probably
and
now
withdraw
the
make
it
certainly
of
course
that
better
murmured
her
companion
then
phillips
must
know
the
name
and
must
have
an
outline
of
the
proposed
plan
and
amy
leffingwell
began
to
look
with
renewed
interest
on
the
counterfeit
form
and
features
of
the
young
man
who
enjoyed
bertram
cope
friendly
regard
and
so
the
moments
of
entertainment
cope
in
turn
went
on
i
glad
he
really
appears
to
like
declared
phillips
on
the
way
home
it
makes
him
seem
quite
human
inwardly
she
was
resolving
to
have
both
the
young
men
to
dine
at
the
earliest
possible
date
it
was
not
always
practicable
to
invite
a
single
young
man
as
often
as
you
wished
having
two
to
ask
simplified
the
problem
considerably
cope
flushed
and
now
rather
tired
walked
up
stairs
with
his
photographs
took
a
perfunctory
sip
from
a
looked
at
the
inkstain
on
his
finger
and
sat
down
at
his
table
two
or
three
sheets
of
a
letter
were
lying
on
it
and
he
a
paragraph
or
so
before
dipping
his
pen
you
were
rather
exacting
about
that
excursion
was
all
right
and
a
few
days
of
new
air
and
new
scenes
would
have
done
me
a
lot
of
good
still
i
acknowledge
your
first
claim
but
remember
that
i
gave
up
indian
rock
for
you
even
if
you
did
give
up
green
bay
for
me
i
hope
the
fellow
who
took
you
has
got
anything
further
to
propose
if
he
has
i
ask
for
a
tip
in
turn
naturally
it
was
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
explain
to
him
and
i
have
seen
him
since
but
i
can
truly
say
that
a
relative
come
and
that
she
was
needed
or
thought
she
was
he
picked
up
his
pen
for
a
fresh
paragraph
the
new
photos
added
to
those
i
had
have
come
in
quite
nicely
they
have
just
helped
me
entertain
a
couple
of
callers
women
have
abounded
in
these
parts
peck
scurrying
about
more
than
usual
an
aunt
from
home
getting
away
with
her
baggage
more
than
she
needed
to
bring
and
then
the
two
who
have
just
gone
it
all
makes
me
feel
like
wanting
to
take
part
in
a
or
a
though
as
i
am
now
i
might
not
last
two
minutes
at
either
the
lady
who
called
was
phillips
i
thought
she
might
as
well
know
that
you
were
coming
of
course
you
are
already
invited
good
and
plenty
to
her
house
look
in
old
and
see
if
you
ca
find
watch
if
it
turns
out
you
can
get
away
the
holidays
come
down
and
go
out
with
me
to
freeford
for
christmas
i
have
had
some
rather
glum
hours
and
miss
you
more
than
ever
i
have
been
within
arm
length
of
one
of
the
university
trustees
who
can
probably
place
me
but
i
know
just
how
much
that
can
be
counted
upon
for
if
for
anything
show
yourself
that
will
help
b
goes
cope
was
himself
in
a
few
days
he
set
aside
his
aunt
counsel
in
regard
to
a
better
regimen
as
well
as
her
more
specific
hints
made
in
view
of
the
near
approach
of
rough
weather
that
he
provide
himself
with
rubbers
and
an
umbrella
even
if
he
would
not
hear
of
a
am
i
made
of
money
he
asked
he
gave
a
like
treatment
to
some
intimations
contributed
by
medora
phillips
during
her
call
he
met
them
with
the
smiling
polite
patience
which
a
man
sometimes
employs
to
inform
a
woman
that
she
does
quite
know
what
she
is
talking
about
he
presently
in
as
active
circulation
on
the
campus
and
elsewhere
as
ever
the
few
who
looked
after
him
at
all
came
to
the
view
that
he
possessed
more
mettle
than
stamina
he
had
no
special
fondness
for
athletics
he
was
doing
little
to
keep
still
less
to
increase
a
young
man
natural
endowment
of
strength
and
vigor
occasional
tennis
on
the
faculty
courts
and
not
much
else
so
the
vast
gymnasium
went
for
little
with
him
and
the
wide
football
field
for
less
and
the
great
lake
close
by
for
nothing
this
last
however
counted
for
little
more
with
any
one
else
those
who
knew
the
lake
best
were
best
content
to
leave
it
alone
as
a
source
of
pleasure
it
had
too
many
perils
treacherous
was
the
common
word
its
treachery
was
reserved
of
course
for
the
smiling
period
of
summer
especially
did
the
great
monster
lie
in
wait
on
summer
sunday
afternoons
then
the
sun
would
shine
on
its
vast
placid
bosom
and
the
breeze
play
gently
tempting
the
swimmer
toward
its
borders
and
the
light
pleasure
craft
toward
its
depths
and
then
in
a
sudden
disastrous
change
a
quick
gale
from
the
north
with
a
wide
of
white
caps
and
the
morrow
newspapers
told
of
bathers
drowned
in
the
undertow
of
frail
canoes
dashed
to
pieces
against
piers
and
breakwaters
and
of
gay
beflagged
swamped
by
the
sea
miles
from
shore
the
toll
of
fickle
superheated
august
but
in
the
late
autumn
the
immense
savage
creature
was
more
frankly
itself
rude
blustery
tyrannical
no
more
a
smiling
cruel
hypocrite
it
warned
you
often
and
openly
if
warning
you
would
take
it
was
on
the
last
sunday
afternoon
in
october
that
cope
and
amy
leffingwell
were
strolling
along
its
edge
they
had
met
casually
in
front
of
the
chapel
after
a
lecture
or
a
service
by
an
eminent
ethical
teacher
from
abroad
a
bird
of
passage
who
must
pipe
on
this
sunday
afternoon
if
he
were
to
pipe
at
all
cope
who
had
lain
abed
late
made
this
address
a
substitute
for
the
forenoon
service
he
had
missed
and
amy
leffingwell
had
gone
out
somewhat
for
the
sake
perhaps
of
walking
by
the
house
where
cope
lived
they
passed
the
science
building
with
its
tower
crowned
by
an
ornamental
iron
pyramid
for
wireless
and
the
segregated
group
of
theological
dormitories
through
whose
windows
earnest
ringing
young
voices
were
sometimes
heard
at
the
practice
of
and
the
men
club
where
the
billiard
tables
were
doubtless
decorously
covered
with
their
customary
sunday
sheets
of
black
oilcloth
and
took
intuitively
the
path
which
led
along
the
edge
of
the
bluff
beyond
them
further
bluffs
and
a
few
low
headlands
here
a
lighthouse
there
a
elsewhere
and
not
so
far
the
balconied
roof
of
the
station
where
the
boats
light
and
heavy
were
manned
by
muscular
students
their
vigilance
and
activity
interspersed
with
long
periods
of
leisure
or
of
absence
helped
them
to
pay
their
way
out
toward
the
horizon
a
passenger
steamer
en
route
to
some
port
farther
north
or
a
long
singularly
uneventful
between
bow
and
afterhouse
on
its
way
down
from
the
of
superior
the
path
was
narrow
but
cope
unexpectedly
to
himself
had
no
complaint
to
make
really
the
girl
did
better
here
somehow
than
lots
of
other
girls
would
have
done
on
a
wide
sidewalk
most
of
them
walked
too
close
to
you
or
too
far
from
you
altering
the
interval
suddenly
and
arbitrarily
and
tending
to
bump
against
you
when
you
did
expect
it
and
did
want
it
they
were
uncertain
at
crossings
if
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
take
your
arm
as
it
sometimes
became
in
the
evening
on
a
crowded
street
why
they
were
too
gingerly
or
else
pressed
too
close
and
if
it
happened
to
rain
you
sometimes
had
to
take
a
cab
trafficking
with
a
driver
whose
tariff
and
whose
disposition
you
did
not
know
in
fact
a
string
of
minor
embarrassments
and
expenses
but
the
way
this
afternoon
was
clear
and
easy
and
there
were
no
annoyances
save
from
other
walkers
along
the
same
path
the
sun
shone
brightly
at
intervals
a
fresh
breeze
swept
the
wide
expanse
streaked
with
purple
and
green
and
turned
an
occasional
broken
toward
the
western
light
some
large
cumuli
were
abroad
white
or
less
white
or
even
darkling
the
first
windy
sky
of
autumn
cope
and
amy
passed
the
station
where
a
few
people
sat
about
idly
and
where
one
or
two
visitors
pressed
noses
against
glass
panes
to
view
the
boats
within
and
they
reached
presently
a
sort
of
little
public
park
which
lay
along
the
water
here
a
small
pier
ran
out
past
the
shallows
and
in
front
of
a
shack
close
by
it
a
man
sat
resignedly
near
a
group
of
beached
and
upturned
one
or
two
others
were
still
in
the
water
as
was
a
small
sloop
the
fellow
sat
there
without
expectations
the
season
was
about
over
the
day
was
none
too
promising
for
such
as
knew
his
attitude
expressed
in
fact
the
accumulated
disappointment
and
resignation
of
many
months
perhaps
he
was
a
from
the
interior
some
region
of
ponds
and
rivers
and
had
kept
through
an
uneventful
summer
the
notion
that
so
big
a
spread
of
water
would
surely
be
put
to
use
the
sail
of
the
sloop
flapped
in
the
breeze
and
little
else
stirred
our
young
people
overlooked
both
man
and
boat
it
the
same
lake
said
amy
leffingwell
rather
dreamily
after
a
common
silence
of
several
minutes
the
same
returned
cope
promptly
it
just
what
it
was
a
year
ago
a
century
ago
and
a
millennium
ago
i
suppose
if
there
was
anyone
here
to
notice
she
turned
on
him
a
rueful
smile
i
was
thinking
of
a
century
ago
i
was
thinking
of
a
month
ago
a
month
ago
yes
when
we
were
walking
along
the
dunes
oh
i
see
why
yes
it
is
the
same
old
lake
though
it
seems
hard
to
realize
it
foreground
makes
so
much
difference
and
so
does
well
population
i
mean
the
human
element
or
the
absence
of
it
amy
pondered
the
one
drawback
there
was
that
we
could
go
out
on
the
water
go
out
i
should
say
not
no
pier
for
miles
and
the
water
so
shallow
that
hardly
more
than
a
canoe
could
land
still
those
fishermen
out
there
manage
it
but
plain
summerites
especially
if
not
dressed
for
it
would
have
an
unpleasant
time
imitating
them
amy
cast
her
eye
about
here
was
a
shore
a
pier
a
boat
a
man
to
let
it
would
you
like
to
go
out
asked
the
man
himself
perfunctorily
as
from
the
depths
of
a
settled
despair
he
pointed
a
thumb
over
his
shoulder
toward
the
sloop
the
two
young
people
looked
at
each
other
neither
looked
at
the
sky
well
i
do
know
replied
cope
slowly
the
sloop
was
on
a
pretty
small
scale
still
it
was
more
to
manage
than
a
you
have
the
theory
you
know
said
amy
demurely
and
some
practice
cope
looked
at
her
in
doubt
can
you
swim
he
asked
yes
she
returned
i
have
some
practice
if
not
much
theory
could
you
handle
a
jib
under
direction
well
then
if
you
really
wish
the
misanthrope
with
a
twisted
smile
helped
them
get
away
the
mainsail
took
a
steady
set
but
the
jib
from
the
first
possessed
an
active
life
of
its
own
not
that
rope
cried
cope
the
other
very
well
returned
amy
scrambling
across
the
cockpit
and
so
it
went
in
six
or
eight
minutes
their
small
catastrophe
overtook
them
there
came
a
sudden
flaw
from
out
one
of
the
racing
gray
cumuli
and
a
faint
cry
or
two
from
the
distant
shore
theory
had
not
put
itself
into
practice
as
quickly
as
the
emergency
required
all
the
less
so
in
that
it
had
to
work
through
a
crew
encumbered
with
a
longish
skirt
and
a
close
jacket
the
sloop
keeled
over
cope
was
instantly
entangled
with
the
mainsail
and
some
miscellaneous
cordage
and
amy
with
the
water
soaking
her
garments
found
herself
clutching
the
cockpit
edge
she
saw
cope
predicament
and
let
go
her
hold
to
set
him
free
he
helped
shake
himself
loose
with
a
loud
forced
laugh
and
a
toss
of
the
head
to
get
his
long
hair
out
of
his
eyes
we
leave
the
wreck
he
spluttered
and
make
for
the
shore
the
shore
fortunately
was
scarcely
more
than
a
hundred
yards
away
yet
never
had
the
great
twin
towers
of
the
library
seemed
so
distant
or
the
wireless
cage
on
science
hall
so
futile
they
swam
easily
side
by
side
he
supporting
her
in
her
cramped
clothes
at
the
start
and
she
a
bit
concerned
somewhat
supporting
him
toward
the
end
meanwhile
there
was
some
stir
at
the
station
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
shore
the
last
hundred
feet
meant
mere
wading
though
there
was
some
variability
among
the
sand
ridges
of
the
bottom
but
the
water
at
its
deepest
never
reached
their
shoulders
their
small
accident
now
began
to
take
on
the
character
of
a
ceremonial
an
immersion
incident
to
some
religious
rite
or
observance
and
the
little
sunday
crowd
collecting
on
the
water
edge
might
have
been
members
of
some
congregation
sympathetically
welcoming
a
pair
of
converts
to
the
faith
let
hold
our
heads
high
and
walk
straight
said
cope
his
arm
in
hers
heaven
knows
whom
we
are
likely
to
meet
and
throw
your
hat
away
you
look
better
without
it
lord
knows
where
mine
is
he
added
as
he
ran
a
smoothing
hand
over
his
long
locks
very
well
she
said
casting
away
her
ruined
ridiculous
headgear
with
her
free
arm
the
other
in
his
was
giving
more
support
to
him
she
felt
than
he
was
giving
to
her
just
as
they
were
about
to
reach
dry
land
amidst
the
congratulations
and
the
amused
smiles
of
the
little
group
at
the
foot
of
the
bluff
the
belated
crew
of
swept
up
in
their
smallest
boat
and
insisted
on
capturing
them
oh
mr
cope
said
a
familiar
voice
please
let
us
save
you
we
have
saved
a
soul
for
months
cope
recognized
one
of
his
own
students
and
surrendered
though
a
kindly
on
the
bluff
had
been
quick
to
cry
across
the
intervening
yards
of
water
his
offer
of
hospitality
all
right
he
said
take
us
back
to
your
place
where
we
can
dry
and
telephone
he
hoped
too
that
they
might
have
to
encounter
fewer
people
at
the
other
spot
than
at
this
meanwhile
another
boat
belonging
to
the
station
had
set
out
to
aid
the
owner
of
the
sloop
in
its
recovery
it
was
soon
righted
and
was
brought
in
there
was
no
damage
done
and
there
was
no
charge
that
cope
could
not
meet
as
he
learned
next
day
to
his
great
relief
the
station
gave
him
a
dry
outfit
of
clothes
assembled
from
here
and
there
and
telephoned
to
phillips
to
bring
fresh
garments
for
amy
neither
had
time
to
get
a
chill
a
pair
of
kindly
who
were
loitering
on
the
shore
with
their
young
men
insisted
on
carrying
the
heroine
of
the
afternoon
into
retirement
where
they
expeditiously
undressed
her
rubbed
her
and
wrapped
her
in
a
quilt
snatched
from
a
bed
amy
was
cold
indeed
and
inclined
to
shiver
she
understood
now
why
cope
had
not
encouraged
that
bathing
party
at
the
dunes
in
a
few
minutes
medora
phillips
tore
up
in
her
car
with
helga
and
a
mountain
of
clothing
and
wraps
she
was
inclined
to
make
the
most
of
the
occasion
and
she
did
so
with
helga
she
quickly
superseded
the
pair
of
sympathetic
and
ready
maids
whom
she
allowed
to
fade
into
the
background
with
too
scant
recognition
of
their
services
and
when
she
had
got
amy
thoroughly
warmed
and
rehabilitated
she
turned
her
thought
toward
cope
here
certainly
was
a
young
scholastic
recluse
who
had
an
admirable
faculty
for
getting
into
the
public
eye
if
one
section
of
churchton
society
had
talked
about
his
performance
at
her
dinner
all
sections
of
it
would
now
be
discussing
his
new
performance
on
the
high
seas
suddenly
she
was
struck
with
the
notion
that
possibly
his
first
lapse
had
not
left
him
in
condition
to
stand
this
second
one
how
are
you
feeling
she
asked
anxiously
no
chill
no
shock
i
all
right
he
declared
one
of
the
boys
has
just
given
me
a
drink
of
of
but
it
was
a
beverage
the
use
of
which
was
not
generally
approved
in
churchton
phillips
turned
round
suddenly
amy
did
you
have
a
drink
too
of
of
of
if
is
what
you
call
it
i
did
said
amy
firmly
and
i
feel
the
better
for
it
well
get
in
then
and
i
take
you
home
peter
grinned
from
the
front
seat
of
the
car
phillips
placed
herself
between
the
two
victims
on
the
back
one
the
who
had
kept
the
discarded
garments
to
dry
gave
them
all
a
few
smiles
and
hand
wavings
the
two
young
women
and
their
two
young
men
looked
on
with
some
deference
the
general
crowd
gave
a
little
before
turning
its
sunday
leisure
to
other
forms
of
interest
and
the
small
party
whirled
away
amy
leaned
a
tired
moist
head
but
a
happy
one
on
shoulder
he
was
so
quick
she
breathed
and
so
brave
and
so
strong
she
professed
to
believe
that
he
had
saved
her
life
cope
silent
as
he
looked
straight
ahead
between
peter
and
helga
was
almost
afraid
that
she
had
saved
his
among
next
morning
at
breakfast
amy
leffingwell
kept
for
the
most
part
a
rapt
and
meditative
eye
on
her
plate
hortense
gave
her
now
and
then
an
impatient
glare
and
had
to
be
cut
short
in
some
stinging
observations
on
cope
but
it
foolish
medora
phillips
felt
obliged
to
concede
what
in
the
world
made
you
do
it
but
amy
continued
to
smile
at
the
she
seemed
to
be
intimating
that
there
was
a
special
folly
which
transcended
mere
general
folly
and
approximated
wisdom
after
breakfast
she
spoke
a
few
words
to
carolyn
she
had
had
all
night
to
think
the
matter
over
she
now
saw
it
from
a
new
angle
and
in
a
new
light
you
should
have
seen
how
he
shook
himself
free
from
that
sail
and
all
she
said
and
while
we
were
swimming
in
he
held
his
hand
under
my
chin
at
least
part
of
the
time
and
when
we
reached
the
sandbars
he
put
his
arm
through
mine
and
helped
me
over
every
one
and
in
this
state
of
mind
she
went
off
to
her
class
cope
was
received
by
his
own
class
with
a
subdued
hilarity
his
young
people
felt
that
he
had
shown
poor
judgment
in
going
out
on
the
water
at
all
for
the
university
by
tacit
consent
left
the
lake
pretty
well
alone
they
thought
that
once
out
he
had
shown
remarkably
inept
seamanship
and
they
thought
that
he
had
chosen
a
too
near
and
too
stage
for
the
exhibition
of
both
this
forenoon
the
eighteenth
century
novelists
involved
smollett
and
with
every
reference
to
the
water
looks
of
understanding
traveled
from
student
to
student
that
the
class
was
of
both
sexes
made
the
situation
no
better
cope
was
in
good
enough
physical
condition
the
unspeakable
draught
from
the
unspeakable
flask
had
ensured
that
but
he
felt
what
was
in
the
air
of
the
classroom
and
was
correspondingly
ill
at
ease
he
had
had
for
several
days
an
understanding
with
basil
randolph
that
they
were
to
go
together
to
the
next
weekly
reception
of
the
president
wife
randolph
wished
to
push
cope
fortunes
wherever
he
might
and
to
make
him
stand
out
from
the
general
ranks
of
the
young
instructors
he
had
the
entrée
to
the
thursdays
at
the
house
and
he
wanted
cope
to
meet
personally
and
intimately
under
the
guidance
he
could
provide
a
few
of
the
academic
dignitaries
and
some
of
the
wealthier
and
more
prominent
townspeople
notwithstanding
phillips
confident
impression
cope
exploit
at
her
own
table
had
gained
no
wide
currency
the
people
she
had
entertained
were
people
who
expected
and
commanded
a
succession
of
daily
impressions
from
one
quarter
or
another
with
them
a
few
light
words
on
cope
achievement
were
sufficient
they
walked
straight
on
toward
the
sensation
the
next
day
was
sure
to
bring
but
of
course
the
whole
university
knew
about
his
second
performance
some
of
its
members
had
witnessed
it
and
all
of
them
had
read
about
it
next
day
in
churchton
index
the
president
wife
was
a
sprightly
lady
who
believed
in
keeping
up
the
social
end
of
things
her
thursdays
offered
coffee
and
chocolate
at
a
handsomely
appointed
table
and
a
little
dancing
now
and
then
for
the
livelier
of
the
young
professors
and
the
daughters
of
the
families
above
all
she
insisted
on
receiving
even
on
having
a
receiving
line
she
would
summon
for
example
the
wife
of
one
of
the
most
eminent
members
of
the
faculty
and
the
obliging
spouse
of
some
banker
or
manufacturer
and
she
herself
always
stood
of
course
at
the
head
of
her
line
when
cope
came
along
with
randolph
she
intercepted
the
flow
of
material
for
her
several
assistants
farther
on
and
carried
congestion
and
impatience
into
the
waiting
queue
behind
by
detaining
him
and
having
it
out
she
caught
his
hand
with
a
good
firm
nervous
grasp
and
flashed
on
him
a
broad
meaningful
smile
which
saved
which
she
asked
heartily
ryder
who
was
farther
along
in
the
line
but
not
too
far
beamed
delightedly
yet
without
the
slightest
trace
of
malice
an
eminent
visiting
educator
five
or
six
steps
behind
our
hero
frowned
in
question
and
had
to
have
the
situation
explained
by
the
lady
in
his
company
cope
a
trifle
embarrassed
and
to
wish
he
had
not
come
did
what
he
could
to
deprive
the
episode
of
both
hero
and
heroine
it
was
about
an
even
thing
he
guessed
a
matter
of
cooperation
is
that
delightful
exclaimed
the
president
wife
to
the
wife
of
the
banker
before
passing
cope
on
and
so
modern
equality
of
the
sexes
woman
doing
her
share
et
cetera
for
this
she
presently
said
to
the
impatient
educator
from
outside
are
we
and
good
teamwork
she
contrived
to
call
after
cope
who
was
now
disappearing
in
the
crowd
cope
lost
himself
from
randolph
and
presently
got
away
without
seeing
who
was
pouring
coffee
or
who
was
the
lightest
on
foot
among
the
younger
professors
the
president
wife
had
asked
him
besides
how
the
young
lady
had
got
through
it
and
had
even
inquired
after
her
present
condition
well
amy
leffingwell
was
enrolled
among
the
university
instructors
and
doubtless
the
wife
of
the
head
had
been
well
within
her
rights
even
duly
mindful
of
the
proprieties
but
the
index
that
sheet
staid
and
proper
enough
on
most
occasions
had
seemed
on
this
one
to
couple
their
names
quite
unwarrantably
couple
cope
repeated
the
word
and
felt
an
injury
if
he
had
known
that
amy
had
carefully
cut
out
and
preserved
the
offending
paragraph
his
thought
would
have
taken
on
a
new
and
more
disquieting
tone
in
the
inquiry
of
the
president
wife
about
the
condition
of
his
copartner
in
adventure
he
found
a
second
source
of
dissatisfaction
he
had
not
called
up
to
ask
after
amy
but
phillips
with
a
great
show
of
solicitude
had
called
up
early
on
monday
morning
to
ask
after
him
he
had
then
in
turn
made
a
of
course
but
he
could
take
no
credit
for
initiative
neither
had
he
yet
called
at
the
house
nor
did
he
feel
greatly
prompted
to
do
so
that
must
doubtless
be
done
but
he
might
wait
until
the
first
fresh
impact
of
the
event
should
somewhat
have
lost
its
force
phillips
voice
had
kept
over
the
telephone
all
its
vibratory
quality
its
tones
expressed
the
most
palpitating
interest
it
was
already
clear
and
it
became
even
clearer
when
he
finally
called
at
the
house
that
she
was
poetizing
him
into
a
hero
and
that
she
regarded
amy
herself
as
but
a
means
an
instrument
at
this
cope
felt
a
little
more
mortified
than
before
he
knew
that
he
had
done
poorly
in
the
boat
and
he
was
not
sure
that
in
the
first
moment
of
the
upset
he
should
have
freed
himself
unaided
and
he
confessed
that
he
had
not
been
quite
in
condition
to
do
very
well
on
the
way
landward
however
all
passed
within
a
fortnight
or
less
the
incident
would
have
dropped
back
into
its
proper
perspective
and
his
students
would
have
found
some
other
matter
for
entertainment
in
the
circumstances
he
grasped
at
the
first
source
of
consolation
that
came
randolph
was
now
installed
in
his
new
apartment
and
felt
that
though
not
fully
settled
he
might
risk
asking
cope
to
dinner
you
are
the
first
randolph
had
said
cope
could
not
escape
the
flattery
it
was
almost
comfort
his
prompt
acceptance
was
most
welcome
to
randolph
cope
had
dwelt
for
a
moment
on
the
actual
presence
of
aunt
harriet
and
on
his
need
of
her
randolph
had
made
no
precise
study
of
recent
chronology
taking
the
reason
given
over
the
wire
as
a
valid
one
and
feeling
glad
that
there
was
no
hitch
this
time
randolph
gave
cope
a
rapid
view
of
the
apartment
before
they
sat
down
to
dinner
there
were
fewer
pictures
on
the
walls
than
there
were
to
be
and
fewer
rugs
on
the
floors
my
standing
lamp
will
be
in
that
corner
said
randolph
in
the
when
it
comes
he
drew
attention
to
a
second
bedroom
where
a
man
could
be
put
up
on
occasion
you
for
example
if
you
ever
find
yourself
shut
out
late
he
saw
sir
galahad
gauntlets
on
the
dresser
he
even
gave
cope
a
glimpse
of
his
kitchen
where
a
oriental
slightly
smiling
but
otherwise
inexpressive
seemed
to
be
dealing
competently
with
the
but
cope
was
impressed
most
of
all
by
the
table
and
its
paraphernalia
at
phillips
he
had
accepted
the
china
silver
and
napery
as
a
matter
of
course
an
elaborate
entity
quite
outside
his
own
thoughts
and
calculations
it
was
all
so
immensely
far
beyond
his
reach
and
his
needs
randolph
however
had
dealt
as
a
bachelor
with
a
problem
which
he
himself
as
a
bachelor
must
soon
take
up
on
however
different
a
scale
and
plane
for
everything
here
was
rich
and
handsome
he
should
not
know
how
to
select
such
things
still
less
how
to
pay
for
them
he
felt
dashed
he
felt
depressed
once
more
the
wonder
of
having
things
he
sipped
his
soup
in
the
spirit
of
humility
and
did
not
quite
recover
with
the
chops
randolph
made
little
talk
he
was
glad
merely
to
have
cope
there
he
indulged
no
slightest
reference
to
the
accident
he
assumed
willingly
enough
that
cope
had
done
well
in
a
sudden
emergency
but
did
not
care
to
dwell
on
his
judgment
at
the
beginning
still
a
young
man
was
properly
enough
experimental
venturesome
cope
had
recovered
himself
by
the
time
dessert
was
reached
he
accomplished
an
adjustment
to
his
environment
and
randolph
was
glad
to
feel
his
unaffected
response
to
good

and

gipsy
the
time
randolph
said
to
himself
i
shall
try
to
have
him
here
at
least
twice
a
week
once
in
a
while
the
evening
might
be
stormy
and
then
the
gauntlets
would
be
laid
on
the
dresser
perhaps
after
an
informal
smoke
in
pajamas
among
the
curios
ranged
round
the
small
den
cope
set
down
his
with
a
slight
sigh
well
he
said
i
suppose
that
before
long
i
shall
have
to
buy
a
few
sticks
of
furniture
myself
and
a
trifle
of

a
percolator
randolph
looked
across
at
him
in
surprise
you
are
moving
then
you
too
not
to
greatly
better
quarters
he
almost
hoped
yes
and
we
shall
need
a
few
small
things
by
way
of
outfit
we
randolph
looked
more
intently
housekeeping
a
roommate
matrimony
here
was
the
intrusion
of
another
piece
on
the
board
a
piece
new
and
unexpected
would
it
turn
out
to
be
an
added
interest
for
himself
or
a
plain
source
of
disconcertment
cope
having
unconsciously
set
the
ball
rolling
gave
it
further
impetus
he
sketched
his
absent
friend
and
told
of
their
plans
for
the
winter
and
spring
terms
i
shall
try
for
a
large
easy
chair
he
concluded
unless
arthur
can
be
induced
to
bring
one
with
him
randolph
by
this
time
had
led
cope
into
the
den
established
him
between
padded
arms
and
given
him
a
cigar
he
drew
cope
attention
to
the
jades
and
swordguards
to
the
odd
assortment
of
primitive
musical
instruments
which
would
doubtless
in
time
find
a
place
at
the
art
museum
in
the
city
and
to
his
latest
acquisition
a
volume
of
le
prose
it
had
reached
him
but
a
week
before
from
venice
venetia
al
segno
del
mdlvii
said
the
in
fact
it
was
bound
in
vellum
pierced
by
bookworms
and
was
decorated
in
quaint
penmanship
with
marginal
annotations
and
also
on
the
fly
leaves
with
repeated
honorifics
due
to
a
study
of
the
forms
of
address
by
some
young
aspirant
for
favor
randolph
had
rather
depended
on
it
to
take
cope
interest
but
now
the
little
from
the
lagoons
seemed
lesser
in
its
lustre
cope
indeed
took
the
volume
with
docility
and
looked
at
its
classical
and
at
its
quaint
biblical
colophon
but
just
who
bembo
he
asked
and
randolph
realized
with
a
slight
shock
that
young
instructors
teach
only
what
they
themselves
lately
have
learned
and
that
in
many
cases
they
have
not
learned
much
but
in
truth
neither
paid
much
heed
to
the
tabulated
vocables
of
the
venetian
cardinal
nor
to
any
of
the
other
rarities
near
by
basil
randolph
was
wondering
how
he
was
to
take
arthur
lemoyne
and
was
asking
himself
if
his
trouble
in
setting
up
a
new
ménage
was
likely
to
go
for
nothing
and
bertram
cope
while
he
pursued
the
course
of
the
bookworm
through
the
parchment
covers
and
the
yellowed
sheets
within
was
wondering
in
what
definite
way
his
host
might
aid
the
fortunes
of
arthur
lemoyne
and
thus
make
matters
a
little
easier
for
them
both
sig

thus
ran
the
faded
brown
lines
on
the
flyleaf
in
their
solicitous
currying
of
favor
but
these
reiterated
forms
of
address
conveyed
no
meaning
to
cope
and
offered
no
opening
now
as
once
before
he
let
the
matter
wait
randolph
thought
over
cope
statement
of
his
plans
and
his
slight
touch
of
pique
did
not
pass
away
toward
the
end
of
the
evening
he
spoke
of
the
wreck
and
the
rescue
after
all
well
he
said
you
are
not
so
completely
committed
as
i
feared
committed
by
your
new
household
arrangements
well
i
shall
have
back
my
chum
randolph
put
forward
the
alternative
i
was
afraid
for
a
moment
that
you
might
be
taking
a
wife
a
wife
yes
such
a
rescue
often
leads
straight
to
matrimony
in
the
anyhow
cope
laughed
but
with
a
slight
disrelish
we
in
actual
life
still
i
glad
to
think
what
i
said
on
one
stretch
of
the
shore
goes
on
the
other
he
declared
i
do
feel
any
more
inclination
to
wedded
life
than
ever
nor
any
likelihood
here
he
spoke
with
effort
as
if
conscious
of
a
possible
danger
on
some
remote
horizon
of
entering
it
it
have
been
sudden
would
it
commented
randolph
with
a
short
laugh
well
he
went
on
one
who
inclines
to
hospitality
must
work
with
the
material
at
his
disposal
i
shall
be
glad
on
some
occasion
or
other
he
proceeded
with
a
slight
trace
of
formality
creeping
into
his
tone
to
entertain
your
friend
i
shall
be
more
than
glad
replied
cope
to
have
you
meet
at
the
call
of
cope
took
his
own
time
in
calling
upon
the
ashburn
avenue
circle
but
he
finally
made
in
person
the
inquiries
for
which
those
made
by
telephone
were
an
inadequate
substitute
yet
he
waited
so
long
that
only
a
few
hours
before
the
time
he
had
set
he
received
a
sweet
but
somewhat
urgent
little
note
from
amy
leffingwell
suggesting
his
early
appearance
he
felt
obliged
to
employ
the
first
moments
of
his
call
in
explaining
that
he
had
been
upon
the
point
of
coming
anyway
and
that
he
had
set
aside
the
present
hour
two
or
three
days
before
for
this
particular
purpose
an
explanation
he
acknowledged
inwardly
which
held
no
great
advantage
for
him
why
am
i
spinning
such
stuff
he
asked
himself
impatiently
amy
note
of
course
minimized
her
aid
to
him
and
magnified
his
aid
to
her
all
this
was
in
accord
with
established
form
but
it
was
in
still
stronger
accord
with
her
determination
to
idealize
his
share
in
the
incident
his
arm
grasped
hers
firmly
and
she
felt
it
yet
but
when
she
went
on
to
say
not
for
the
first
time
nor
for
the
second
how
kind
and
sympathetic
he
had
been
in
supporting
her
chin
against
those
slapping
waves
when
the
shore
had
seemed
so
far
away
he
wondered
whether
he
had
really
done
so
for
a
moment
or
two
possibly
but
surely
not
as
part
of
a
conscious
reasoned
scheme
to
save
she
was
doing
all
right
enough
he
muttered
in
frowning
protest
neither
did
he
welcome
phillips
tendency
to
make
him
a
hero
she
was
as
willing
as
the
girl
herself
to
believe
that
he
had
kept
chin
above
water
not
for
a
moment
merely
but
through
most
of
the
transit
to
shore
he
sat
there
uneasily
pressing
his
thumbs
between
his
palms
and
his
closed
fingers
and
drawing
up
his
feet
crampingly
within
their
shoes
yet
it
somewhat
eased
his
tension
to
find
that
medora
phillips
was
disposed
to
put
amy
into
a
subordinate
place
amy
had
been
but
a
means
to
an
end
her
prime
merit
consisted
in
having
given
him
a
chance
to
function
any
other
girl
would
have
done
as
well
a
slight
relief
but
a
welcome
another
mitigation
the
house
the
room
was
full
of
people
the
other
young
women
of
the
household
were
present
even
the
young
who
had
understood
the
stove
and
the
pump
had
looked
in
no
chance
for
an
intense
segregated
appreciation
there
had
been
another
weekend
at
the
dunes
when
this
youth
had
nimbly
ranged
the
forest
and
the
beach
to
find
wood
for
the
great
open
fireplace
and
he
had
come
now
at
the
end
of
the
season
to
make
due
acknowledgments
for
privileges
enjoyed
he
for
his
part
was
willing
enough
to
regard
amy
as
a
heroine
but
he
considered
her
as
a
heroine
linked
with
the
wrong
man
and
operative
in
the
wrong
place
he
cared
nothing
in
the
world
for
cope
and
disparaged
him
as
before
when
he
did
not
ignore
him
altogether
if
amy
had
but
been
rescued
by
him
george
pearson
instead
of
by
this
bertram
cope
and
if
she
had
been
snatched
from
a
disorderly
set
of
breakers
at
the
foot
of
those
disheveled
sandhills
instead
of
from
the
prim
prosy
domestic
edge
of
churchton
well
would
the
affair
have
been
better
set
and
better
carried
off
in
such
case
it
might
have
been
picturesque
and
heroic
instead
of
slightly
silly
yes
the
room
was
full
even
joseph
foster
had
contrived
to
get
himself
brought
down
by
peter
further
practice
for
the
day
when
he
should
make
a
still
more
ambitious
flight
and
dine
at
randolph
new
table
he
sat
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
and
tried
to
get
as
best
he
might
the
essential
hang
of
the
situation
the
soft
insidious
insistence
of
amy
the
momentum
and
bravado
of
his
the
veiled
disparagement
of
cope
in
which
george
pearson
seated
on
a
sofa
between
carolyn
and
hortense
indulged
for
their
benefit
or
for
his
own
relief
above
all
he
listened
for
tones
and
undertones
from
cope
himself
he
had
never
seen
cope
before
if
indeed
it
could
be
said
that
he
really
saw
him
now
and
he
had
never
heard
his
speaking
voice
save
at
a
remove
of
two
floors
cope
had
taken
his
hand
vigorously
as
that
of
the
only
man
among
many
women
from
whom
he
had
much
to
expect
and
had
given
him
a
dozen
words
in
a
loud
tone
which
seemed
to
correspond
with
his
pressure
but
cope
voice
in
his
hearing
had
lapsed
from
resonance
to
and
from
that
to
tonelessness
and
from
that
to
quietude
was
the
fellow
in
process
of
making
a
long
diminuendo
a
possible
matter
of
weeks
or
of
months
as
before
when
confronted
by
what
had
once
seemed
a
paragon
of
dash
and
vigor
he
scarcely
knew
whether
to
be
exasperated
or
appeased
through
this
variety
of
spoken
words
and
unspoken
thoughts
hortense
sat
silent
and
watchful
presently
the
talk
lapsed
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
a
small
knot
of
people
can
not
go
on
elaborately
embroidering
upon
a
trivial
incident
forever
there
was
a
shifting
of
groups
a
change
in
subjects
yet
hortense
continued
to
glower
and
to
meditate
what
had
the
incident
really
amounted
to
what
did
the
man
himself
really
amount
to
she
soon
found
herself
at
his
side
behind
the
and
its
spreading
he
was
silently
handling
a
with
his
eyes
cast
down
see
me
she
said
in
a
tense
vibratory
tone
speak
to
me
and
she
glowered
upon
him
i
am
no
kitten
like
amy
i
am
no
tame
tabby
like
carolyn
sending
out
written
invitations
throw
a
few
poor
words
my
way
cope
dropped
the
her
address
was
like
a
dash
of
brine
in
the
face
and
he
welcomed
it
tell
me
did
you
look
absurd
then
she
dashed
ahead
a
return
to
fresh
water
after
all
why
he
rejoined
reluctantly
no
man
dressed
in
all
his
clothes
looks
any
the
better
for
being
soaked
through
and
amy
she
must
have
looked
absolutely
ridiculous
that
wide
flapping
hat
and
all
i
had
been
telling
her
for
weeks
that
it
was
out
of
style
she
threw
it
away
said
cope
shortly
and
i
suppose
her
hair
looked
as
well
as
a
woman
ever
does
when
she
in
the
water
well
she
observed
it
one
thing
to
be
ridiculous
and
another
to
go
on
being
ridiculous
i
hope
you
do
mean
to
do
that
the
pronoun
you
has
its
equivocal
aspects
her
expression
while
marked
enough
threw
no
clear
light
cope
took
the
entire
onus
on
himself
of
course
no
man
would
choose
to
be
ridiculous
still
less
to
stay
so
do
please
let
me
keep
on
dry
land
i
beginning
to
feel
he
shifted
his
ground
why
do
you
try
to
make
it
seem
that
i
do
care
to
talk
with
you
because
you
do
have
i
noticed
it
i
have
it
seems
to
me
that
i
of
course
you
have
does
that
make
it
any
better
i
sure
the
last
thing
in
the
world
i
should
want
to
do
would
be
to
i
know
would
be
to
show
partiality
to
fail
in
treating
all
alike
even
that
small
programme
is
much
nor
likely
to
please
any
girl
but
you
have
failed
to
carry
it
out
small
as
it
is
here
in
this
house
there
on
the
dunes
what
have
i
been
and
where
put
into
any
obscure
corner
lost
in
the
woods
left
off
somewhere
on
the
edge
of
things
cope
stared
and
tried
to
stem
her
protests
she
was
of
the
blood
her
aunt
own
niece
but
whereas
medora
phillips
sometimes
scrapped
as
he
called
it
merely
to
promote
social
diversion
and
to
keep
the
conversational
ball
this
young
person
a
more
vigorous
organism
and
with
decided
even
exaggerated
ideas
as
to
her
dues
well
the
room
was
still
full
and
he
was
glad
enough
of
it
i
do
know
whether
i
like
you
or
not
she
went
on
in
a
low
rapid
tone
and
i
do
suppose
you
very
much
like
me
but
i
wo
go
on
being
ignored
ignored
why
stammered
cope
my
sense
of
obligation
to
this
house
she
shrugged
scornfully
his
sense
of
obligation
had
been
made
none
too
apparent
certainly
it
had
not
been
brought
into
line
with
her
deserts
and
demands
cope
took
up
the
again
and
looked
out
across
the
room
amy
leffingwell
questioningly
was
looking
across
at
him
he
could
change
feet
if
that
made
the
general
discomfort
of
his
position
any
less
he
did
so
amy
was
standing
near
the
piano
and
held
a
sheet
or
two
of
new
music
in
her
hands
and
medora
phillips
with
a
word
of
general
explication
and
direction
made
the
girl
intention
clear
amy
had
a
new
song
for
baritone
with
a
violin
obbligato
and
the
usual
piano
accompaniment
and
cope
was
to
sing
it
was
an
extremely
simple
thing
quite
within
his
compass
and
carolyn
who
could
read
easy
music
at
sight
awfully
easy
declared
amy
would
play
the
piano
part
and
amy
herself
would
perform
the
obbligato
with
no
statement
as
to
whether
it
was
simple
or
not
carolyn
approached
the
task
and
the
piano
in
the
passive
spirit
of
accommodation
cope
came
forward
with
reluctance
this
was
not
an
evening
when
he
felt
like
singing
besides
he
preferred
to
choose
his
own
songs
also
he
would
have
preferred
to
warm
up
on
something
familiar
amy
took
her
instrument
from
its
case
with
a
suppressed
sense
of
ecstasy
and
it
is
the
ecstatic
who
generally
sets
the
pace
the
thing
went
none
too
well
amy
was
the
only
one
who
had
seen
the
music
before
and
she
was
the
only
one
who
particularly
wanted
to
make
music
now
however
the
immediate
need
was
not
that
the
song
should
go
well
but
that
it
should
go
that
it
should
go
on
that
it
should
go
on
and
on
repetitiously
until
it
should
come
or
even
not
come
to
go
better
she
slid
her
bow
across
the
strings
with
tasteful
passion
she
enjoyed
still
more
than
her
own
tones
the
tones
of
cope
voice
tones
which
whether
in
happy
unison
with
hers
or
not
were
after
all
seldom
misplaced
whatever
they
may
have
lacked
in
heartiness
and
confidence
it
was
a
short
piece
and
on
the
third
time
it
went
rather
well
how
perfectly
lovely
exclaimed
phillips
at
the
right
moment
cope
smiled
deprecatingly
it
might
be
made
to
go
very
nicely
he
said
it
gone
very
nicely
insisted
amy
it
did
this
last
time
she
waved
her
bow
with
some
vivacity
she
had
heaved
the
whole
of
her
young
self
into
the
work
she
had
been
buoyed
up
by
cope
tones
which
with
repetition
had
gathered
assurance
if
not
expressiveness
and
she
based
her
estimate
of
the
general
effect
on
the
impression
which
her
own
inner
nature
had
experienced
and
her
impression
was
heightened
when
pearson
forging
forward
and
ignoring
both
cope
and
carolyn
thanked
her
richly
and
emphatically
for
her
part
a
part
which
to
him
seemed
the
whole
hortense
who
had
kept
her
place
behind
the
large
lampshade
twisted
her
interlocked
fingers
and
said
no
word
foster
who
had
disposed
himself
on
an
inconspicuous
couch
kept
his
own
counsel
after
all
cope
singing
had
sounded
better
from
upstairs
at
close
range
a
ringing
assertiveness
had
somehow
failed
cope
had
come
with
no
desire
to
extend
his
stay
beyond
the
limits
of
an
evening
call
he
declined
to
sing
on
his
own
account
and
soon
rose
as
if
to
make
his
general
adieux
you
wo
give
us
one
of
your
own
songs
then
asked
medora
phillips
in
a
disappointed
tone
and
at
my
dinner
no
she
could
not
quite
say
that
at
her
dinner
cope
whatever
he
had
failed
to
do
had
contributed
no
measure
of
entertainment
for
her
guests
give
us
a
recitation
then
persisted
medora
or
tell
us
a
story
or
make
up
here
she
indulged
herself
in
an
airily
imperious
flight
a
story
of
your
own
on
the
spot
a
trifling
request
truly
but
heavens
said
cope
i
am
not
an
author
still
less
an
i
am
sure
you
could
be
returned
medora
fondly
just
try
cope
sat
down
again
and
began
to
run
his
eye
uncomfortably
about
the
room
as
if
dredging
the
air
for
an
idea
behind
one
corner
of
a
mirror
was
a
large
bunch
of
drying
leaves
they
had
been
brought
in
from
the
sand
dunes
as
a
decorative
souvenir
of
the
autumn
and
had
kept
their
place
through
mere
inertia
an
oak
bough
once
crimson
and
russet
a
convoluted
length
of
bittersweet
to
which
a
few
split
berries
still
clung
and
a
branch
of
sassafras
with
its
intriguing
variety
of
leaves
a
branch
selected
in
fact
because
it
gave
within
narrow
compass
the
plant
entire
scope
and
repertoire
as
to
foliage
cope
caught
at
the
sassafras
as
a
falling
balloonist
catches
at
his
parachute
well
he
said
still
reluctant
and
fumbling
perhaps
i
can
devise
a
legend
the
legend
let
us
say
of
the
sassafras
bush
good
cried
medora
heartily
pearson
whispering
to
amy
leffingwell
gave
little
heed
to
cope
and
his
strained
endeavor
to
please
phillips
foster
quite
passive
listened
with
curiosity
for
what
might
come
or
perhaps
you
would
prefer
cope
went
on
why
the
sassafras
has
three
kinds
of
leaves
or
something
like
that
better
yet
exclaimed
medora
listen
everybody
why
the
sassafras
has
three
kinds
of
leaves
pearson
stopped
his
buzzings
and
cope
began
the
he
said
slowly
were
a
nice
enough
lot
of
girls
but
they
labored
under
one
great
disadvantage
they
had
no
thumbs
hortense
pricked
up
her
ears
did
he
mean
to
be
personal
if
so
he
should
find
that
one
of
the
nymphs
had
a
whole
hand
as
surely
as
he
himself
had
a
cheek
cope
paused
of
course
you
got
to
postulate
he
submitted
apologetically
of
course
medora
agreed
so
when
they
bought
their
gloves
or
mittens
or
whatever
their
handgear
might
be
called
they
usually
patronized
the
hickory
or
the
beech
or
some
other
tree
with
leaves
that
were
ovate
cried
medora
delightedly
ovate
yes
or
whatever
just
the
right
word
may
be
but
a
good
many
of
them
traded
at
the
sign
of
the
sassafras
where
they
found
leaves
that
were
similar
but
rather
more
delicate
i
believe
he
going
to
do
it
thought
foster
yet
the
nymphs
knew
that
they
lacked
thumbs
and
kept
on
wanting
them
so
during
the
long
dull
winter
they
put
their
minds
to
it
and
finally
thumbs
came
said
medora
and
early
in
april
they
went
to
the
sassafras
and
said
have
thumbs
we
have
thumbs
so
we
need
a
different
sort
of
mitten
the
sassafras
was
only
half
awake
he
repeated
many
cried
the
nymphs
a
passing
breeze
roused
the
sassafras
he
became
at
least
awake
i
doubt
it
muttered
hortense
interesting
he
said
aim
to
supply
all
new
needs
come
back
in
a
month
or
so
and
meanwhile
i
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
in
may
the
nymphs
returned
with
their
thumbs
and
asked
about
our
new
mittens
the
story
was
really
under
way
now
and
cope
went
on
with
more
confidence
and
with
greater
animation
and
see
said
the
sassafras
they
looked
and
saw
among
its
simple
ordinary
leaves
were
several
with
two
lobes
one
on
each
side
these
do
said
the
nymphs
said
we
had
two
thumbs
but
we
meant
one
on
each
hand
stupid
do
we
should
say
not
the
sassafras
was
mortified
he
said
all
i
can
manage
this
season
i
sorry
not
to
have
understood
you
young
ladies
and
your
needs
come
back
again
next
spring
it
was
a
long
time
to
wait
but
they
waited
next
may
amy
now
unworried
by
george
pearson
began
to
get
the
thread
of
the
thing
foster
was
sure
the
thread
would
run
through
hortense
was
still
alert
for
ulterior
meanings
poor
cope
however
had
no
ambition
to
spin
a
double
thread
a
single
one
was
all
he
was
equal
to
next
may
the
nymphs
after
nursing
their
thumbs
for
a
year
hortense
came
back
again
and
there
among
the
plain
leaves
and
the
leaves
were
several
fresh
bright
smooth
ones
with
a
single
lobe
well
to
one
side
the
very
thing
for
mittens
and
yes
he
has
done
it
foster
acknowledged
and
that
ended
cope
rather
stridently
as
he
rose
to
go
on
the
flood
of
a
sudden
yet
unexpected
success
is
why
the
sassafras
why
the
sassafras
has
three
kinds
of
leaves
cried
medora
in
triumph
mittens
for
midsummer
made
no
difficulty
cope
gave
carolyn
careful
thanks
for
her
support
at
the
piano
and
did
not
see
that
she
felt
he
too
could
be
a
poet
if
he
only
would
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
shake
hands
with
hortense
and
did
not
realize
how
nearly
a
new
quarrel
had
opened
he
stepped
over
to
do
the
like
with
amy
but
she
went
out
with
him
into
the
hall
the
only
one
of
the
party
who
did
and
even
accompanied
him
to
the
front
door
thank
you
so
much
she
said
looking
up
into
his
face
smilingly
and
holding
his
hand
with
a
long
clinging
touch
it
went
beautifully
and
there
are
others
that
will
go
even
better
others
he
thought
for
an
instant
that
she
was
thanking
him
for
his
legend
and
was
even
threatening
to
regard
him
as
a
flowing
fount
of
invention
but
he
soon
realized
that
her
mind
was
fixed
exclusively
on
their
duet
if
such
it
was
to
be
called
the
deuce
he
thought
enough
is
enough
despite
his
success
with
the
sassafras
he
went
home
discomforted
and
even
flustered
that
hand
was
too
much
like
the
hand
of
possession
the
girl
was
stealing
over
him
like
a
light
intangible
vapor
he
struck
ahead
with
a
quicker
gait
as
if
trying
to
outwalk
a
creeping
fog
one
consolation
however
hortense
had
come
like
a
puff
of
wind
even
a
second
squall
from
the
same
quarter
would
not
be
altogether
amiss
and
had
there
not
been
one
further
fleeting
source
of
reassurance
had
he
not
on
leaving
caught
through
the
open
door
of
the
drawing
room
an
elevation
of
medora
phillips
eyebrows
which
seemed
to
say
fondly
indulgently
yet
a
bit
ironically
oh
you
foolish
girl
yet
if
a
girl
is
foolish
and
is
going
to
persist
in
her
folly
a
lightly
lifted
pair
of
eyebrows
will
not
always
stay
her
course
her
gathering
momentum
is
hardly
to
be
checked
by
such
slender
means
finds
himself
amy
leffingwell
having
written
once
found
it
easier
to
write
again
and
having
strolled
along
the
edge
of
the
bluff
with
cope
on
that
fateful
sunday
she
found
it
natural
to
intercept
him
on
other
parts
of
the
campus
where
their
paths
might
easily
cross
or
to
stroll
with
him
after
casual
encounters
carefully
planned
through
sheets
of
fallen
leaves
under
the
wide
avenues
of
elms
just
outside
her
third
note
almost
summoned
him
to
a
rendezvous
it
annoyed
him
but
he
might
have
been
more
than
annoyed
had
he
known
of
her
writing
rather
simply
to
a
rather
simple
mother
in
fort
lodge
iowa
about
her
hopes
and
her
expectations
her
mother
had
of
course
heard
in
detail
of
the
rescue
and
afterward
had
heard
in
still
greater
detail
as
the
roseate
of
idealization
had
come
to
focus
more
exactly
on
the
scene
she
had
had
also
an
unaffected
appreciation
or
several
of
personal
graces
and
accomplishments
she
had
heard
lastly
of
song
to
her
daughter
obbligato
a
duet
since
carolyn
had
been
suppressed
and
the
surrounding
company
had
been
banished
to
a
remote
circumference
what
wonder
that
she
began
to
see
her
daughter
and
bertram
cope
in
an
admirable
isolation
and
to
intimate
that
she
hoped
very
soon
for
definite
news
well
not
a
few
of
us
have
met
an
amy
leffingwell
some
child
with
a
delicate
little
concave
nose
not
at
all
strong
and
a
fine
little
chin
none
too
vigorously
moulded
and
a
pair
of
timid
candid
blue
eyes
shadowed
by
a
wisp
or
so
of
fluffy
hair
and
have
not
always
taken
her
for
what
she
was
she
hurt
a
kitten
we
say
and
we
assume
that
her
striking
out
a
line
for
herself
is
the
last
thing
she
would
try
to
do
yet
such
an
unimpressive
and
disarming
façade
may
mask
large
chambers
of
stubbornness
and
tenacity
amy
knew
how
long
and
hard
she
had
thought
of
cope
and
she
asked
for
some
evidence
that
he
had
been
thinking
long
and
hard
of
her
she
desired
a
response
but
in
fact
he
had
been
thinking
of
her
only
when
he
must
he
thought
of
her
whenever
he
saw
himself
caught
in
that
flapping
sail
and
he
thought
of
her
whenever
he
recalled
that
she
had
taken
it
on
herself
to
select
his
songs
but
he
did
not
want
her
to
make
demands
on
his
time
and
attention
still
less
did
he
want
her
to
talk
about
happiness
this
had
come
to
be
her
favorite
topic
and
she
discoursed
on
it
profusely
he
was
almost
ungracious
enough
to
say
that
she
did
so
glibly
happiness
that
conventional
bliss
toward
which
she
was
turning
her
mind
as
they
strolled
together
on
these
late
november
afternoons
was
for
him
a
long
way
ahead
how
furnish
a
house
how
clothe
and
feed
a
wife
at
least
until
his
thesis
should
be
written
and
a
place
with
a
real
salary
found
in
the
academic
world
how
even
buy
an
engagement
ring
that
costly
superfluity
how
even
contrive
to
pay
for
all
the
small
gifts
and
attentions
which
an
engagement
involved
yet
why
ask
himself
such
questions
for
he
was
conscious
of
a
fundamental
repugnance
to
any
such
scheme
of
life
and
was
acutely
aware
that
for
awhile
at
least
and
perhaps
for
always
he
wanted
to
live
in
quite
a
different
mode
amy
confident
assumptions
began
to
fill
the
house
to
alter
its
atmosphere
medora
phillips
who
had
begun
by
raising
her
eyebrows
in
light
criticism
now
lowered
them
in
frowning
protest
she
had
found
cope
charming
but
this
charm
of
his
was
to
add
to
the
attractiveness
of
her
house
and
to
give
her
a
high
degree
of
personal
gratification
it
was
not
to
be
frittered
away
still
less
was
it
to
be
absorbed
elsewhere
hortense
who
had
been
secretly
at
work
on
a
of
cope
in
oil
and
rather
despising
herself
for
it
now
began
to
make
another
bold
picture
in
her
own
mind
she
saw
herself
handing
out
the
sketch
to
cope
in
person
with
an
air
of
high
bravado
she
might
say
if
bad
came
to
worse
that
she
had
found
some
professional
interest
in
his
color
or
in
his
planes
on
one
occasion
medora
hardily
requisitioned
cope
for
an
evening
at
the
theatre
in
the
city
miles
in
and
miles
back
she
had
him
in
her
car
all
to
herself
and
if
amy
next
day
appeared
to
feel
that
wealth
and
organization
had
taken
an
unfair
advantage
of
simple
honest
love
medora
herself
was
troubled
by
no
stirrings
of
conscience
the
new
atmosphere
reached
even
foster
on
the
top
floor
and
when
one
evening
in
he
finally
carried
out
his
plan
to
dine
with
randolph
the
household
situation
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
that
he
had
not
the
clearest
understanding
of
the
situation
did
not
diminish
his
interest
in
it
though
he
sat
in
the
dark
and
far
apart
some
sense
all
his
own
cultivated
through
years
of
deprivation
came
to
his
aid
peter
brought
him
down
the
street
and
round
the
corner
and
randolph
chinaman
fascinated
by
his
green
shade
and
his
tortuous
method
of
locomotion
once
out
of
his
did
the
rest
you
had
better
stay
all
night
randolph
had
suggested
and
he
was
glad
to
avoid
a
second
awkward
trip
on
the
same
evening
foster
had
wondered
whether
cope
would
be
present
he
had
not
asked
to
meet
him
for
he
hardly
knew
whether
he
wished
to
or
not
though
this
was
an
occasion
and
his
he
had
left
randolph
to
act
quite
as
he
might
choose
there
was
a
third
chair
at
table
and
randolph
delayed
dinner
ten
minutes
while
waiting
for
it
to
be
filled
well
let
go
in
and
sit
down
he
said
presently
with
a
slight
twist
of
the
mouth
he
spoke
lightly
as
if
it
were
as
easy
for
foster
to
sit
down
as
for
himself
but
foster
got
into
his
place
after
a
moment
and
contrived
to
spread
his
napkin
over
his
legs
i
expected
bertram
cope
randolph
went
on
but
he
is
here
and
i
have
no
word
from
him
and
do
not
know
whether
he
paused
obviously
at
a
loss
not
here
repeated
foster
is
there
then
one
place
where
he
is
not
why
joe
our
house
is
full
of
him
foster
burst
out
raucously
he
had
removed
the
green
for
the
as
they
sometimes
will
were
performing
their
office
in
the
low
but
clear
light
his
face
seemed
distorted
he
rises
to
my
floor
like
incense
the
very
halls
and
stairways
reek
with
his
charms
and
perfections
well
you
escape
him
here
said
randolph
ruefully
the
whole
miserable
place
is
steaming
with
expectation
with
the
deadly
aroma
of
a
courtship
going
stale
i
ca
stand
it
i
stand
it
courtship
you
may
think
it
takes
two
but
it
does
that
foolish
girl
has
thrown
the
whole
place
into
discomfort
and
confusion
and
i
do
know
who
for
or
who
against
what
foolish
girl
asked
randolph
quickly
was
at
his
elbow
changing
plates
it
was
assumed
justly
enough
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
follow
the
intricacies
of
a
situation
purely
occidental
our
amy
replied
foster
with
a
dash
of
bitterness
amy
leffingwell
asked
randolph
still
more
quickly
foster
had
blind
eyes
but
alert
ears
he
felt
that
randolph
was
surprised
and
displeased
and
indeed
his
host
was
both
that
boy
fallen
maladroitly
in
love
thought
randolph
it
was
a
second
check
he
had
exerted
himself
to
show
a
friendliness
for
cope
had
expected
to
enjoy
him
while
he
stayed
on
for
his
months
in
town
and
had
hoped
to
help
push
his
fortunes
in
whatever
other
field
he
might
enter
he
had
even
taken
his
present
quarters
no
light
task
all
the
details
considered
to
make
cope
winter
agreeable
no
less
than
his
own
and
now
first
the
friend
from
wisconsin
with
whom
cope
was
arranging
to
live
next
this
sudden
unexpected
affair
with
that
girl
at
medora
did
the
fellow
not
know
his
own
mind
could
he
formulate
no
plan
here
randolph
in
his
disappointment
inconsistently
forgot
that
a
plan
was
largely
his
real
annoyance
and
grievance
then
he
remembered
he
looked
at
the
vacant
place
and
tried
for
composure
and
justice
i
shall
probably
hear
some
good
reason
in
due
time
he
said
i
hope
so
rejoined
foster
but
it
takes
these
young
fellows
to
be
careless
and
ungrateful
he
made
no
pretense
of
ignoring
the
fact
that
randolph
had
moved
into
this
apartment
more
on
account
of
cope
than
for
any
other
reason
h
yes
responded
randolph
thoughtfully
i
suppose
it
is
the
tendency
of
a
young
fellow
who
has
never
quite
stood
on
his
own
legs
financially
to
accept
about
everything
that
comes
his
way
and
to
accept
it
as
a
matter
of
course
it
is
said
foster
i
know
that
was
that
way
continued
randolph
looking
studiously
at
the
nearest
i
was
beyond
the
middle
twenties
before
i
quite
launched
out
for
myself
and
any
kindness
received
was
taken
without
much
question
and
without
much
thanks
i
presume
that
he
still
has
some
assistance
from
home
he
dropped
youthful
insouciance
over
favors
received
to
consider
the
change
that
marriage
makes
in
a
young
man
status
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
assert
that
a
young
man
married
is
a
man
that
marred
this
stiff
doctrine
foster
acknowledged
but
somehow
he
does
seem
done
for
he
is
placed
he
is
cut
off
from
wide
ranges
of
interesting
possibilities
he
offers
himself
less
invitingly
to
the
roving
imagination
meanwhile
cope
with
randolph
invitation
driven
altogether
from
his
mind
by
more
urgent
matters
was
pacing
the
streets
through
the
first
of
the
winter
and
was
wondering
rather
distractedly
just
where
he
stood
precisely
what
words
at
a
very
brief
yet
critical
juncture
had
he
said
or
not
said
exactly
how
had
he
phrased
or
failed
to
phrase
the
syllables
which
constituted
perhaps
a
in
his
life
amy
leffingwell
had
demanded
his
attendance
for
one
more
walk
that
afternoon
and
he
had
not
been
dextrous
enough
face
to
face
with
her
to
refuse
she
had
expressed
herself
still
more
insistently
on
happiness
on
hers
his
theirs
the
two
were
one
in
her
view
and
on
a
future
shared
together
in
just
what
inadequate
way
had
he
tried
to
fend
her
off
had
he
said
i
shall
have
to
wait
or
had
his
blundering
tongue
said
instead
we
should
have
to
wait
or
even
worse
we
shall
have
to
wait
in
any
event
he
had
used
that
cowardly
temporizing
word
wait
for
she
had
instantly
seized
upon
it
why
yes
indeed
she
was
willing
to
wait
she
had
expected
to
wait
he
turned
out
from
an
avenue
lighted
with
electric
globes
past
which
the
snowflakes
were
drifting
and
entered
a
quieter
and
darker
in
the
dusk
she
had
put
up
her
face
expecting
to
be
kissed
and
he
partly
out
of
pity
for
the
expression
that
came
when
he
hesitated
and
partly
out
of
pure
embarrassment
and
inexpertness
had
lightly
touched
her
lips
that
had
sealed
it
possibly
he
saw
her
sitting
in
rapt
fancy
in
her
bedroom
if
not
more
vocal
in
the
rooms
below
he
saw
her
writing
to
an
unseen
mother
in
a
tone
of
joyful
complacency
and
looking
at
her
finger
for
a
ring
which
he
could
not
place
there
he
saw
the
distaste
of
his
own
home
circle
to
which
this
event
had
come
at
least
a
year
too
soon
he
saw
the
amazement
and
worse
of
arthur
lemoyne
whose
plans
for
coming
to
town
were
now
all
made
and
to
whom
this
turn
would
prove
a
psychological
shock
which
might
deter
him
from
coming
at
all
but
most
of
all
he
saw
and
felt
to
the
depths
of
his
being
his
own
essential
repugnance
to
the
life
toward
which
he
now
seemed
headed
what
an
outlook
for
christmas
what
an
unpleasant
surprise
for
his
parents
what
opportunity
in
amy
leffingwell
holiday
vacation
at
fort
lodge
to
reinforce
the
written
page
by
the
spoken
word
still
forgetful
of
his
engagement
with
randolph
he
continued
to
walk
the
streets
he
turned
in
at
midnight
hoping
he
might
sleep
and
trusting
that
morning
would
throw
a
less
sinister
light
on
his
misadventure
long
before
this
joseph
foster
had
been
put
to
bed
by
in
this
spare
room
it
was
foster
crutch
rather
than
a
knightly
sword
which
leaned
against
the
and
it
was
foster
crooked
members
rather
than
the
straight
young
limbs
of
cope
which
first
found
place
among
the
sheets
and
blankets
of
that
shining
new
brass
bedstead
has
a
distressful
cope
awakened
at
seven
after
an
early
interval
of
happy
lightness
there
came
suddenly
and
heavily
the
crushing
sense
of
his
predicament
how
monstrous
it
was
that
one
instant
of
time
one
action
one
word
could
clamp
a
repellent
burden
on
a
man
for
the
rest
of
his
life
well
he
must
expect
telephone
messages
and
letters
they
came
that
afternoon
peck
had
a
lady
voice
to
report
it
sounded
like
a
lady
voice
she
added
and
she
looked
at
cope
with
some
curiosity
a
young
lady
asking
for
him
over
the
wire
was
the
rarest
thing
in
the
world
next
day
came
the
first
note
the
handwriting
was
utterly
new
to
him
but
his
intuition
applied
instantly
to
the
envelope
told
him
of
the
source
the
nail
driven
was
now
to
be
clinched
she
had
the
right
to
ask
him
to
come
and
she
did
ask
him
to
come
soon
cope
troubled
eyes
sought
the
calendar
above
his
table
how
many
days
to
christmas
how
much
time
might
he
spend
in
freeford
how
long
before
christmas
might
he
arrange
to
leave
churchton
the
holidays
at
home
loomed
as
a
harbor
of
refuge
by
shortening
as
far
as
possible
the
interval
here
and
by
lengthening
as
far
as
possible
the
stay
with
his
family
he
might
cut
down
in
some
measure
the
imminent
threatenings
of
awkwardness
and
constraint
then
beyond
the
range
of
anything
but
letters
he
might
study
the
unpleasant
situation
at
his
leisure
and
determine
a
future
course
he
set
himself
to
answer
amy
note
he
hoped
he
said
to
see
her
in
a
few
days
but
he
was
immensely
busy
in
closing
the
before
the
holidays
he
also
suggested
that
their
affair
their
affair
be
kept
quiet
for
the
present
yet
he
had
all
too
facile
a
vision
of
beatific
meditations
that
were
like
enough
to
give
the
situation
away
to
all
the
household
and
he
was
nervously
aware
of
amy
leffingwell
as
continually
on
the
verge
of
bubbling
confidences
he
also
wrote
to
lemoyne
his
letter
was
less
an
announcement
than
a
confession
i
like
this
began
lemoyne
reply
with
abrupt
impetuous
sarcasm
you
have
claimed
more
than
once
he
went
on
to
have
steadied
me
and
kept
me
out
of
harm
way
but
i
never
yet
made
any
such
demands
on
you
as
you
are
making
on
me
this
thing
ca
go
on
and
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
nip
it
nip
it
now
do
think
that
our
intimacy
is
to
end
in
any
such
fashion
as
this
for
it
is
especially
at
this
particular
lemoyne
proceeded
to
practical
matters
if
that
room
is
still
free
engage
it
from
the
first
of
january
i
will
have
a
few
things
sent
down
father
is
weakening
a
little
anyhow
i
got
enough
money
for
a
couple
of
months
i
will
join
you
in
freeford
between
christmas
and
new
year
nearer
the
latter
probably
and
we
will
go
back
cope
rather
took
heart
from
these
rough
outspoken
lines
lemoyne
was
commonly
neither
rough
nor
outspoken
but
here
was
an
emergency
involving
his
own
interests
which
must
be
dealt
with
decisively
cope
seemed
to
feel
salvation
on
the
way
perhaps
that
was
why
he
still
did
so
little
to
save
himself
he
took
the
new
room
he
had
one
meeting
with
amy
and
he
left
for
home
at
least
two
days
before
he
was
strictly
entitled
to
do
so
the
meeting
took
place
in
phillips
he
would
trust
himself
to
no
more
strolls
on
the
campus
to
no
more
confabs
in
college
halls
there
was
protection
in
numbers
and
numbers
seldom
failed
beneath
medora
phillips
roof
they
failed
this
time
however
phillips
and
hortense
were
away
at
a
reading
only
amy
and
carolyn
were
at
home
cope
seized
on
carolyn
as
at
a
straw
he
thanked
her
warmly
again
for
her
halting
offices
in
the
matter
of
that
last
song
and
he
begged
that
he
might
hear
some
of
her
recent
verse
his
appeal
was
vehement
almost
boisterous
carolyn
surprised
felt
that
he
was
ready
at
last
to
grant
her
a
definite
personality
amy
tried
in
vain
to
remove
carolyn
from
the
board
but
carolyn
like
hortense
had
finally
joined
the
ranks
of
the
recognized
she
was
determined
being
still
ignorant
cope
was
glad
to
see
regarding
claims
to
make
this
recognition
so
marked
as
to
last
beyond
the
moment
she
played
a
little
not
well
she
read
she
even
accompanied
amy
to
the
door
at
the
close
of
cope
short
stay
he
shook
hands
with
them
both
he
had
decided
that
he
would
do
no
more
than
this
with
amy
in
any
event
and
carolyn
presence
made
his
predetermined
course
easy
even
obligatory
yet
he
went
out
into
the
night
feeling
somehow
that
he
had
acted
solely
on
his
resolution
and
that
he
might
consider
himself
a
man
of
some
decisiveness
after
all
amy
had
looked
disappointed
but
had
contrived
to
whisper
that
she
would
write
from
iowa
that
of
course
was
to
be
looked
for
and
would
represent
the
combined
efforts
of
herself
and
her
home
circle
yet
he
had
a
fortnight
for
consideration
and
counsel
cope
during
his
first
few
days
at
home
was
moody
and
abstracted
his
parents
found
him
adding
little
to
the
christmas
cheer
his
mother
always
busy
over
domestic
cares
and
now
busier
than
ever
thought
that
he
must
have
been
working
too
hard
she
would
stand
in
the
kitchen
door
with
a
pie
on
one
hand
and
ponder
him
as
he
sat
in
the
staring
absorbedly
at
the
franklin
stove
his
father
who
saw
him
chiefly
in
the
evening
by
the
of
the
house
found
his
face
slightly
pinched
was
his
pocket
pinched
too
and
would
he
be
likely
before
leaving
to
ask
help
toward
making
up
a
deficit
his
sister
rosalys
who
lived
a
life
of
dry
routine
figured
him
as
deep
in
love
he
let
several
days
pass
without
hinting
what
the
real
situation
was
there
was
interest
all
round
when
the
day
before
christmas
the
postman
came
along
the
bleak
and
flimsy
street
and
left
a
letter
for
him
cope
was
away
from
the
house
and
rosalys
studying
the
penmanship
and
even
its
postmark
found
vague
confirmation
of
her
theory
some
college
girl
one
of
his
own
students
probably
was
home
on
vacation
just
as
he
was
if
so
a
small
town
person
of
caste
and
character
like
themselves
not
brilliant
but
safe
she
set
up
the
letter
edgewise
on
the
back
parlor
mantelpiece
when
cope
came
in
at
noon
and
saw
the
letter
his
face
fell
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
sat
silent
at
table
and
disappeared
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
rosalys
whose
pupils
were
off
her
mind
for
a
few
days
and
who
had
thought
to
spare
began
to
shade
her
theory
cope
read
the
letter
in
the
back
bedroom
the
ceiling
sloped
away
on
one
side
which
had
been
his
for
so
many
years
those
years
of
happy
boyhood
how
far
away
they
seemed
now
and
how
completely
past
surely
he
had
never
thought
to
come
back
to
these
familiar
walls
to
such
effect
as
this
well
what
did
it
say
it
said
in
its
four
pages
yes
amy
had
really
limited
herself
thus
how
joyous
she
was
that
the
dear
christmas
season
had
brought
her
such
a
beautiful
it
said
that
mother
was
so
pleased
and
happy
and
even
mentioned
a
sudden
aunt
it
said
how
willingly
she
would
wait
on
until
that
evening
cope
made
his
announcement
they
were
all
seated
round
the
in
the
back
parlor
where
the
old
brussels
carpet
looked
dim
and
where
only
venerated
age
kept
the
ornate
french
clock
from
seeming
tawdry
cope
looked
down
at
the
carpet
and
up
at
the
clock
and
spoke
yes
they
must
have
it
his
mother
took
the
shock
first
and
absorbed
most
of
it
she
led
a
humdrum
life
and
she
was
ready
to
welcome
romance
to
help
adjust
herself
she
laid
her
hands
with
a
soft
sweeping
motion
on
the
two
brown
waves
that
drew
smoothly
across
her
temples
and
then
she
transferred
them
to
his
held
his
head
and
gave
him
a
kiss
rosalys
took
his
two
hands
warmly
and
smiled
and
he
tried
to
smile
back
his
father
twisted
the
tip
of
his
short
gray
beard
watched
his
son
mien
and
said
little
day
after
with
the
major
part
of
their
small
christmas
festivities
over
he
would
ask
how
this
unexpected
and
unwarranted
situation
had
come
about
and
how
in
heaven
name
the
thing
was
to
be
carried
through
by
what
means
with
whose
help
in
his
complex
of
thought
the
word
thesis
came
to
his
tongue
but
he
kept
from
speaking
it
he
had
been
advised
that
his
son
had
at
last
struck
out
definitely
into
some
bookish
bypath
just
what
bypath
mattered
little
he
gathered
if
it
were
but
followed
to
the
end
yet
the
end
was
still
far
and
the
boy
evidently
realized
this
he
was
glad
that
bertram
was
sober
over
the
prospect
and
over
his
present
plan
which
was
a
serious
undertaking
just
now
in
truth
cope
had
to
adjust
himself
to
all
this
and
to
endure
besides
the
congratulations
or
the
comments
of
a
number
of
tiresome
relatives
and
it
was
a
relief
when
on
the
arthur
lemoyne
finally
arrived
lemoyne
had
been
heralded
as
a
young
man
of
parts
and
as
the
son
of
a
family
which
enjoyed
in
winnebago
some
significant
share
of
worldly
prosperity
and
therefore
of
social
consideration
the
simpler
copes
putting
him
in
the
other
back
bedroom
the
ceiling
of
which
sloped
the
opposite
way
wondered
if
they
were
quite
giving
him
his
just
dues
when
rosalys
came
to
set
away
his
handbag
and
to
rearrange
next
morning
his
brushes
on
the
top
of
the
dresser
she
gathered
from
various
indications
supplied
by
his
outfit
that
the
front
chamber
at
whatever
inconvenience
to
whomever
would
have
been
more
suitable
but
never
mind
said
her
mother
they
do
very
well
as
they
are
side
by
side
with
the
door
conveniently
between
then
bert
can
look
after
him
a
little
more
and
we
a
little
less
lemoyne
presented
himself
to
the
combined
family
gaze
as
a
young
man
of
or
so
with
dark
limpid
eyes
a
good
deal
of
dark
wavy
hair
and
limbs
almost
too
plumply
in
his
hands
the
flesh
minimized
the
prominence
of
joints
and
knuckles
and
the
fingers
especially
the
little
fingers
displayed
certain
graceful
slightly
affected
movements
of
the
kind
which
may
cause
a
person
to
be
credited
or
taxed
with
possessing
the
artistic
temperament
to
end
with
he
carried
two
inches
of
short
black
stubble
under
his
nose
he
was
a
type
which
one
may
admire
or
not
rosalys
cope
found
in
him
a
sort
of
picturesque
allure
rather
liking
him
herself
she
found
a
different
reason
for
her
brother
liking
if
bert
cares
for
him
she
remarked
i
suppose
it
largely
by
contrast
he
so
spare
and
himself
it
was
evident
that
on
this
first
meeting
lemoyne
meant
to
ingratiate
himself
to
make
himself
attractive
and
entertaining
he
had
determined
to
say
a
thing
or
two
before
he
went
away
and
it
would
be
advantageous
to
consolidate
his
position
he
had
had
five
or
six
hours
of
travel
with
some
tedious
waits
at
junctions
and
at
about
ten
after
some
showy
converse
he
acknowledged
himself
tired
enough
for
bed
cope
saw
him
up
and
did
not
come
down
again
the
two
talked
till
past
eleven
and
even
much
later
when
light
sleepers
in
other
parts
of
the
house
were
awake
for
a
few
minutes
muffled
sounds
from
the
same
two
voices
reached
their
ears
but
cope
words
many
as
they
were
told
lemoyne
nothing
that
he
did
not
know
little
that
he
had
not
divined
the
sum
of
all
was
this
cope
did
not
quite
know
how
he
had
got
into
it
but
he
knew
that
he
was
miserable
and
wanted
to
get
out
of
it
lemoyne
had
asked
first
of
all
to
see
the
letter
from
iowa
oh
come
cope
had
replied
you
know
it
was
written
for
anybody
but
me
the
substance
of
it
then
lemoyne
had
demanded
and
cope
reluctant
and
had
given
it
you
never
been
in
anything
of
this
sort
you
know
he
submitted
i
should
say
not
lemoyne
retorted
nor
you
either
you
not
in
it
now
or
if
you
are
you
soon
going
to
be
out
of
it
you
would
help
me
through
a
thing
like
this
and
i
going
to
help
you
the
talk
went
on
lemoyne
presented
the
case
for
a
broken
engagement
engagements
as
it
was
well
known
to
human
experience
might
if
quickly
made
be
as
quickly
unmade
no
novelty
in
that
i
had
never
expected
to
double
up
with
an
engaged
man
lemoyne
declared
further
nothing
especially
jolly
about
that
least
of
all
when
the
poor
wretch
is
held
dead
against
his
will
as
he
went
on
he
made
cope
feel
that
he
had
violated
an
of
long
standing
and
had
almost
brought
a
trusting
friend
down
from
home
under
false
pretenses
but
phrases
from
amy
letter
continued
to
plague
cope
there
was
a
confiding
trust
a
tender
well
said
lemoyne
at
about
two
let
put
it
off
till
morning
turn
over
and
go
to
sleep
but
before
he
fell
asleep
himself
he
resolved
that
he
would
make
the
true
situation
clear
next
day
he
would
address
that
sympathetic
mother
and
that
romantic
sister
in
suitably
cogent
terms
the
father
he
felt
sure
would
require
no
effort
and
would
even
welcome
his
aid
with
a
strong
sense
of
relief
so
next
day
lemoyne
deploying
his
natural
graces
and
his
dramatic
dexterities
drew
away
the
curtain
he
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
bertram
had
been
tricked
he
did
not
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
had
been
inexpert
he
contented
himself
with
saying
that
his
friend
had
been
and
that
his
fine
nature
had
rather
been
played
upon
the
mother
took
it
all
with
a
silent
inexpressive
thoughtfulness
though
it
was
felt
that
she
did
not
want
her
boy
to
be
unhappy
rosalys
if
she
admired
lemoyne
a
little
more
now
liked
him
rather
less
her
father
when
the
declaration
reached
him
by
secondary
impact
did
feel
the
sense
of
relief
which
lemoyne
had
anticipated
and
came
to
look
upon
him
as
an
able
if
somewhat
fantastic
young
fellow
cope
himself
when
his
father
questioned
him
said
with
frank
disconsolateness
i
miserable
and
i
wish
to
heaven
i
were
out
of
it
he
added
out
of
it
his
father
counselled
and
when
cope
own
feelings
were
clearly
known
through
the
household
there
was
no
voice
of
dissent
and
then
buckle
down
for
your
degree
the
elder
added
to
finish
if
i
only
could
exclaimed
cope
with
a
wan
face
convinced
youthfully
that
the
trouble
through
which
he
was
now
striving
must
last
indefinitely
i
should
be
glad
enough
to
get
my
mind
on
it
sure
he
walked
away
to
reconstruct
a
devastated
privacy
arthur
i
not
quite
sure
that
i
thank
you
he
said
later
h
replied
lemoyne
i
hope
he
added
more
definitely
articulate
that
we
going
to
have
a
pleasanter
life
in
our
new
quarters
i
getting
mighty
little
pleasure
if
you
just
understand
me
here
safeguarded
calls
if
cope
came
back
from
freeford
with
the
moral
support
of
one
family
amy
leffingwell
came
back
from
fort
lodge
with
the
moral
support
of
another
hers
was
a
fragmental
family
true
but
its
sentiment
was
unanimous
she
had
the
combined
support
of
a
pleased
mother
and
of
an
enthusiastic
maiden
aunt
amy
reached
churchton
first
and
it
soon
transpired
through
the
house
in
which
she
lived
that
she
was
engaged
to
bertram
cope
cope
returning
two
days
later
with
lemoyne
found
his
new
status
an
open
book
to
the
world
or
to
such
a
small
corner
of
the
world
as
cared
to
read
cope
had
written
from
freeford
explaining
to
randolph
the
broken
at
least
he
had
said
that
immediate
concerns
of
importance
had
driven
the
date
from
his
mind
and
that
he
was
sorry
randolph
only
too
willing
to
accept
any
fair
excuse
made
this
one
serve
the
boy
was
not
so
negligent
and
ungrateful
after
all
he
got
the
rest
of
the
story
a
few
days
later
in
a
message
from
foster
what
the
boy
then
he
asked
himself
he
recalled
their
talk
as
they
had
walked
past
the
on
that
october
sunday
cope
had
disclaimed
all
inclination
for
matrimony
he
had
confessed
a
certain
inability
to
safeguard
himself
was
he
a
victim
after
all
a
victim
to
his
own
ineptitude
a
victim
to
his
own
highmindedness
well
whatever
the
alternative
a
field
for
the
work
of
the
had
opened
at
the
big
house
on
ashburn
avenue
a
like
feeling
had
come
to
prevail
medora
phillips
herself
had
passed
from
the
indulgently
satirical
to
the
impatient
and
almost
to
the
indignant
her
niece
thought
the
new
relation
clearly
superfluous
she
put
away
the
portrait
in
oil
but
she
rather
hoped
to
resume
work
on
it
some
time
meanwhile
she
was
far
from
kind
to
amy
cope
soon
made
an
obligatory
appearance
at
the
house
he
was
glad
enough
to
have
the
presence
and
the
support
of
arthur
lemoyne
the
call
came
on
a
rigorous
evening
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
week
in
january
the
two
young
men
had
about
brought
their
new
quarters
to
shape
and
subjection
they
had
spent
two
or
three
evenings
in
shifting
and
rearranging
things
trifling
purchases
in
person
and
larger
things
sent
by
express
they
had
reached
a
good
degree
of
snugness
and
comfort
but
we
got
to
go
tonight
said
cope
firmly
tonight
repeated
lemoyne
unless
i
mistaken
we
in
for
a
deuce
of
a
time
he
snuggled
again
into
the
big
easy
chair
that
had
just
arrived
from
winnebago
we
are
returned
cope
with
unhappy
mien
but
it
got
to
be
gone
through
with
i
talking
about
the
weather
rejoined
lemoyne
plumply
he
was
versed
in
the
reading
of
signs
as
they
presented
themselves
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
to
the
north
and
he
thought
he
could
accurately
apply
his
experience
to
a
locale
somewhat
beyond
his
earlier
ken
the
vast
open
welter
of
water
to
the
east
would
but
give
the
roaring
north
wind
a
greater
impetus
we
going
to
have
tonight
the
storm
of
the
season
storm
or
no
storm
i
ca
put
it
off
any
longer
i
got
to
go
as
they
started
out
the
wind
was
keen
and
a
few
fine
flakes
driven
from
the
north
flew
athwart
their
faces
when
they
reached
phillips
house
peter
wrapped
in
furs
was
sitting
in
the
limousine
by
the
curb
and
two
or
three
people
were
seen
in
the
open
door
of
the
vestibule
well
the
best
of
luck
cope
heard
the
voice
of
phillips
saying
in
a
quick
expulsion
of
syllables
this
is
going
to
be
a
bad
night
i
afraid
but
i
hope
your
audience
will
get
to
the
hall
to
hear
you
and
that
our
pierre
will
be
able
to
get
you
back
to
us
oh
madame
returned
the
plump
little
man
what
a
climate
and
he
ran
down
the
walk
to
the
car
yes
phillips
had
another
celebrity
on
her
hands
it
was
an
eminent
french
historian
who
was
going
across
to
the
campus
to
deliver
the
second
lecture
of
his
course
how
lucky
she
had
said
to
hortense
just
after
dinner
that
we
went
to
hear
him
night
their
visitor
was
handsomely
accommodated
and
suitably
too
she
felt
in
the
louis
quinze
chamber
and
he
was
expected
back
in
it
a
little
after
ten
why
bertram
cope
she
exclaimed
as
the
two
young
men
came
up
the
walk
while
the
great
historian
ran
down
come
in
come
in
do
let
me
stand
here
freezing
it
turned
out
to
be
a
young
man
night
phillips
had
invited
a
few
types
to
entertain
and
instruct
her
frenchman
they
had
come
to
dinner
and
they
had
stayed
on
afterward
among
them
was
the
autumn
undergraduate
whom
cope
at
an
earlier
day
had
disdainfully
called
phaon
a
youth
of
twenty
you
know
said
medora
phillips
to
randolph
a
few
days
later
when
reviewing
the
stay
of
her
newest
guest
those
sophisticated
people
so
appreciate
our
fresh
innocent
ingenuous
boys
pelouse
told
me
on
leaving
that
roddy
quite
met
his
ideal
of
the
young
american
so
so
inexperienced
so
out
of
the
great
world
good
heavens
said
randolph
impatiently
do
they
constitute
the
world
you
might
think
so
going
about
giving
us
awards
and
hanging
medals
on
us
and
certifying
how
well
we
speak
french
fudge
the
world
is
changing
it
would
be
better
he
added
if
more
of
us
college
students
included
learned
how
to
speak
a
decenter
english
i
went
to
their
dramatic
club
the
other
evening
such
pronunciation
such
delivery
i
almost
longed
for
the
films
a
second
young
american
was
present
george
pearson
pearson
lived
with
his
parents
in
another
big
house
a
block
down
the
street
phillips
had
summoned
him
as
a
type
that
was
purely
indigenous
the
young
american
business
man
pearson
had
just
made
a
kill
as
he
called
it
a
coup
executed
quite
without
the
aid
of
his
father
and
he
was
too
full
of
his
success
to
keep
still
he
was
more
typical
than
ever
the
professor
had
looked
at
him
in
staring
wonder
so
had
amy
leffingwell
in
the
absence
of
another
target
for
her
large
intent
eyes
but
medora
phillips
knew
all
about
george
and
roddy
the
novelty
was
lemoyne
and
she
must
learn
about
him
she
readily
seized
the
points
that
composed
his
personal
aspect
which
she
found
good
his
general
darkness
and
richness
made
him
a
fine
foil
for
cope
she
quickly
credited
him
with
a
pretty
complete
battery
of
artistic
aptitudes
and
apprehensions
she
felt
certain
that
he
would
appreciate
her
ballroom
and
and
would
figure
well
within
it
the
company
was
young
the
night
was
wild
and
cheer
was
the
word
she
presently
led
the
way
upstairs
foster
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
first
voices
in
the
hall
and
the
first
footfalls
on
the
bare
treads
of
the
upper
stairs
shut
his
door
lemoyne
felt
the
big
bare
room
bare
save
for
a
piano
and
a
fringe
of
chairs
and
settles
large
and
small
as
a
stage
and
he
surmised
that
he
the
was
expected
to
exhibit
himself
on
it
he
became
consciously
the
actor
he
tried
now
the
assertive
note
and
now
the
quiet
note
somehow
the
quiet
was
the
louder
of
the
two
pearson
who
was
in
a
conquering
mood
tonight
scented
a
rival
in
the
general
attention
and
one
not
wholly
unworthy
pearson
was
the
only
one
of
the
four
in
evening
dress
and
he
felt
that
to
be
an
advantage
he
at
least
had
been
properly
attired
to
meet
the
elegant
visitor
from
abroad
as
for
poor
roddy
he
had
come
in
an
ordinary
sack
perhaps
it
was
partly
this
which
had
prompted
pelouse
who
was
of
course
dressed
for
the
platform
to
find
the
boy
such
a
paragon
of
simple
innocence
all
costumes
were
alike
to
lemoyne
he
had
appeared
in
dozens
if
he
lacked
costume
now
he
made
it
up
in
manner
he
had
bestowed
an
immensity
of
manner
on
amy
leffingwell
downstairs
his
cue
had
been
a
high
delicate
remote
gravity
i
know
i
know
he
seemed
to
say
and
i
make
no
comment
upstairs
he
kept
close
by
cope
he
was
proprietary
he
was
protective
if
cope
settled
down
in
a
large
chair
lemoyne
would
drape
himself
over
the
arm
of
it
and
his
hand
would
fall
as
like
as
not
on
the
back
of
the
chair
or
even
on
shoulder
and
when
he
came
to
occupy
the
cope
standing
alongside
would
lay
a
hand
on
his
phillips
noticed
these
minor
familiarities
and
remarked
on
them
to
foster
who
had
lately
wheeled
his
chair
in
foster
a
few
days
later
passed
the
comment
on
to
randolph
with
an
astringent
comment
of
his
at
all
events
amy
leffingwell
remained
in
the
distance
and
george
pearson
shared
the
distance
with
her
foster
had
broken
from
his
retirement
on
hearing
the
voices
of
cope
and
lemoyne
combined
in
song
the
song
was
larboard
watch
and
he
remembered
how
his
had
sung
in
it
during
courtship
with
the
young
fellow
who
had
acted
later
as
his
best
man
lemoyne
at
the
first
word
of
invitation
had
seated
himself
at
the
instrument
a
lesser
than
the
grand
downstairs
but
not
unworthy
then
with
but
a
measure
or
so
of
prelude
the
two
voices
had
begun
to
ring
out
in
the
old
nautical
ballad
lemoyne
felt
the
composition
to
be
primitive
antiquated
and
of
slight
value
but
he
had
received
his
cue
and
both
his
throat
and
his
hands
wrought
with
an
elaborate
expressiveness
he
sang
and
played
if
not
with
sincerity
at
least
with
effect
his
voice
was
a
high
ringing
tenor
not
too
ringing
for
cope
resonant
baritone
but
almost
too
sweet
a
voice
which
might
cloy
if
used
alone
within
a
few
moments
cope
was
a
perfect
second
and
the
two
went
at
it
with
a
complete
unity
of
understanding
and
of
sentiment
together
they
viewed
in
thirds
the
clouds
together
still
in
thirds
they
roused
themselves
at
the
welcome
call
of
larboard
watch
ahoy
disregarding
the
mere
words
they
attained
at
the
finish
to
something
like
feeling
or
even
like
a
touch
of
passion
medora
phillips
had
never
heard
cope
sing
like
that
before
had
never
seen
so
much
animation
in
his
singing
face
by
the
fourth
bar
there
had
been
tears
in
her
eyes
and
there
was
a
catch
in
her
breath
when
she
exclaimed
softly
you
dear
boys
it
was
too
soon
of
course
to
make
lemoyne
dear
the
one
boy
was
cope
it
was
really
his
voice
which
she
had
heard
through
the
soaring
insinuating
tones
of
the
other
foster
sitting
beside
her
suddenly
raised
his
shade
and
peered
out
questioningly
both
at
the
singers
and
at
his
he
seemed
surprised
and
more
pearson
was
surprised
too
but
kept
his
applause
within
limits
however
he
praised
lemoyne
for
his
accompaniment
then
he
begged
amy
for
an
air
on
the
violin
and
while
they
were
determining
who
should
play
her
accompaniment
the
wind
raged
more
wildly
round
the
gables
and
the
thickening
snow
drove
with
a
fiercer
impetus
against
the
windows
lemoyne
who
was
a
perfectly
good
begged
that
he
might
not
be
condemned
to
spoil
another
performance
this
was
the
result
of
an
understanding
between
cope
and
himself
that
neither
was
to
contribute
further
presently
a
simple
piece
was
selected
through
which
the
unskilled
carolyn
might
be
trusted
to
pick
her
way
cope
listened
with
a
decorous
attention
which
was
designed
to
indicate
the
highest
degree
of
sympathetic
interest
but
his
attitude
so
finely
composed
within
yet
so
ineffectively
displayed
without
was
as
nothing
to
the
loud
promptness
of
pearson
praise
amy
glanced
at
cope
with
questioning
surprise
but
she
met
pearson
excesses
of
commendation
with
a
gratified
smile
shortly
before
ten
there
was
a
stir
at
the
front
door
phillips
rose
hastily
it
is
pelouse
let
me
go
down
and
pet
him
yes
it
was
pelouse
oh
madame
he
said
as
before
but
with
an
expressiveness
doubly
charged
what
a
climate
he
was
panting
and
was
covered
with
fine
snow
behind
him
was
peter
looking
very
grave
and
dour
shall
i
be
wanted
further
asked
peter
in
a
tense
tone
and
with
no
trace
of
his
usual
smile
what
again
cried
phillips
while
helga
farther
up
the
hall
was
undoing
the
professor
three
times
on
a
night
like
this
no
indeed
get
back
into
the
garage
as
fast
as
you
can
oh
madame
said
the
professor
now
out
of
his
wrappings
and
in
better
control
of
his
voice
they
were
so
faithful
to
our
beautiful
france
the
was
almost
full
well
said
phillips
to
herself
they
got
there
all
right
then
i
hope
most
of
them
will
get
back
home
alive
what
a
climate
pelouse
was
still
saying
as
he
entered
the
he
had
not
been
there
before
he
ran
an
appraising
eye
over
the
pictures
and
said
little
but
as
soon
as
he
learned
that
some
of
them
were
the
work
of
the
late
phillips
he
found
words
he
led
the
company
through
a
tasteful
jungle
of
verbosity
and
left
the
ultimate
impression
that
monsieur
had
been
a
remarkable
man
whether
as
artist
or
as
collector
yet
he
did
not
forget
to
say
once
more
what
a
climate
is
it
really
bad
outside
asked
pearson
pelouse
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
was
it
is
indeed
corroborated
phillips
she
had
spent
her
moment
at
the
front
door
nobody
that
i
can
find
room
for
leaves
my
house
tonight
this
meant
that
cope
and
lemoyne
were
to
occupy
the
chintz
chamber
pelouse
gradually
regained
himself
cope
interested
him
cope
was
in
type
the
more
american
of
the
two
new
arrivals
he
was
also
as
pelouse
had
heard
the
yes
the
well
he
was
calm
and
inexpressive
enough
no
close
and
eager
attendance
cool
cool
how
interesting
said
the
observer
to
himself
and
mademoiselle
quite
across
the
room
and
quite
taken
up
happily
too
it
seemed
with
another
man
with
the
other
man
perhaps
at
half
past
ten
pearson
rose
to
leave
cope
and
lemoyne
rose
at
the
same
time
no
said
phillips
stopping
them
both
you
think
of
trying
to
go
i
ca
ask
peter
to
take
you
and
you
could
never
get
across
on
foot
in
the
world
i
can
find
a
place
for
you
and
about
poor
roddy
asked
hortense
roddy
may
stay
with
me
declared
pearson
i
can
put
him
up
come
on
aldridge
he
said
you
good
for
a
hundred
yard
dash
and
down
they
started
i
do
want
to
stay
muttered
cope
to
lemoyne
under
cover
of
the
others
departure
devil
take
it
it
the
last
thing
in
the
world
i
want
to
do
it
awkward
returned
lemoyne
but
we
in
for
it
after
all
it
is
house
nor
her
family
besides
you
got
me
phillips
summoned
helga
and
another
maid
who
were
just
on
the
point
of
going
to
bed
and
directed
their
efforts
toward
the
chintz
chamber
ah
well
thought
pelouse
the
then
is
going
to
remain
over
night
in
the
house
of
his
it
was
droll
yet
there
were
extenuating
circumstances
but
such
a
singular
climate
such
curious
temperaments
such
a
general
chill
and
pelouse
was
presently
lost
to
view
among
the
welcome
trappings
of
louis
quinze
shall
be
next
morning
cope
left
the
house
before
breakfast
he
had
had
the
forethought
to
plead
an
exceptionally
early
engagement
and
thus
he
avoided
meeting
after
the
strain
of
the
evening
before
any
of
the
various
units
of
the
household
he
and
lemoyne
draping
their
pajamas
over
the
foot
of
the
bedstead
left
the
chintz
chamber
at
seven
and
walked
out
into
the
new
day
the
air
was
cold
and
tingling
the
ground
was
white
as
a
sheet
the
sky
was
a
strident
implacable
blue
the
glitter
and
the
glare
assaulted
their
sleepy
eyes
they
turned
up
their
collars
thrust
their
hands
deep
into
their
pockets
and
took
briskly
the
half
mile
which
led
to
their
own
percolator
and
electric
toaster
cope
threw
himself
down
on
the
bed
and
let
lemoyne
get
the
breakfast
well
he
had
called
he
had
done
the
just
and
expected
thing
he
had
held
his
face
through
it
all
but
he
was
tired
after
a
night
of
much
thought
and
little
sleep
possibly
he
might
not
have
to
call
again
for
a
full
week
if
messages
or
letters
came
he
would
take
them
as
best
he
could
nor
was
lemoyne
very
alert
he
was
less
prompt
than
usual
in
gaining
his
early
morning
loquacity
his
coffee
was
lacking
in
spirit
and
much
of
his
toast
was
burnt
but
the
two
revived
in
fair
measure
after
their
taxing
walk
they
had
talked
through
much
of
the
dead
middle
of
the
night
foster
wakeful
and
restless
had
become
exasperated
beyond
all
power
of
a
return
to
sleep
concerns
of
youth
and
love
kept
them
murmuring
murmuring
in
the
acute
if
distant
ears
of
one
whom
youth
had
left
and
for
whom
love
was
impossible
beyond
his
foolish
figured
wall
were
two
contrasted
types
of
young
vigor
and
they
babbled
babbled
on
in
the
sensitized
hearing
of
one
from
whom
vigor
was
gone
and
for
whom
hope
was
set
what
do
you
think
of
her
cope
had
asked
then
he
had
thrown
his
face
into
his
pillow
and
left
one
ear
for
the
reply
she
is
a
clinger
returned
lemoyne
she
will
cling
until
she
is
loosened
by
something
or
somebody
then
she
will
cling
to
the
second
somebody
as
hard
as
she
did
to
the
first
i
not
so
sure
that
it
you
as
an
individual
especially
cope
had
now
no
to
consider
no
to
guard
he
did
not
raise
his
face
from
out
the
pillow
to
reply
but
he
found
lemoyne
rather
drastic
arthur
had
shown
himself
much
in
earnest
of
course
he
had
the
right
doubtless
to
be
reproachful
and
he
was
fertile
in
suggestions
looking
toward
his
friend
freedom
yet
his
expedients
were
not
always
delicate
or
fair
cope
would
have
welcomed
a
lighter
hand
on
his
exacerbated
spirit
a
more
disinterested
more
impartial
touch
he
was
glad
when
one
afternoon
at
five
a
few
days
later
he
met
randolph
on
the
steps
of
the
library
randolph
by
his
estimate
was
disinterested
and
impartial
the
weather
still
held
cold
it
was
no
day
for
spending
time
conversationally
outside
and
they
stepped
back
for
a
little
into
a
recess
of
the
vestibule
cope
found
an
opening
by
bolstering
up
his
previous
written
excuses
he
was
still
very
general
that
all
right
replied
randolph
in
friendly
fashion
some
time
soon
we
must
try
again
and
this
time
we
must
have
your
friend
his
glance
was
kind
yet
keen
nor
was
it
brief
randolph
had
already
the
outlines
of
the
situation
as
foster
understood
them
he
sometimes
slipped
in
on
sunday
forenoon
to
read
the
newspapers
to
foster
instead
of
going
to
church
hortense
and
carolyn
came
up
now
and
then
indeed
this
reading
was
theoretically
a
part
of
carolyn
duties
but
she
was
coming
less
and
less
frequently
and
often
never
got
beyond
the
headlines
so
that
every
other
sunday
at
least
randolph
set
aside
and
hymnal
for
dramatic
criticisms
editorials
sports
and
society
this
time
foster
was
full
of
the
events
of
friday
night
as
i
make
it
out
he
kept
away
from
her
the
whole
evening
and
that
new
man
helped
him
do
it
our
friend
down
the
street
hortense
says
showed
every
disposition
to
cut
in
and
the
girl
showed
at
least
some
disposition
to
let
him
i
do
wonder
when
you
come
right
down
to
it
he
twice
the
man
the
other
is
young
pearson
yes
clever
lad
confident
but
brash
just
what
his
father
used
to
be
he
praised
her
playing
cope
sat
dumb
and
next
morning
he
hurried
away
before
breakfast
you
know
what
kind
of
a
morning
it
was
anything
very
pressing
at
the
university
on
a
saturday
morning
at
eight
i
hardly
know
how
about
this
sudden
new
friend
foster
twitched
in
his
chair
medora
he
went
on
seems
to
have
no
special
fancy
for
him
she
even
objects
to
his
calling
cope
of
course
he
sings
and
he
seems
to
be
and
clever
but
that
express
it
he
was
so
awfully
so
publicly
at
home
at
least
that
as
i
gather
it
always
hanging
over
the
other
man
chair
always
finding
a
reason
to
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
no
wonder
pearson
came
to
the
fore
i
do
know
what
i
heard
makes
me
think
of
and
here
foster
speaking
with
a
keen
and
complicated
acerbity
recalled
how
during
earlier
years
of
travel
he
had
had
opportunity
to
observe
a
young
married
couple
at
a
saratoga
hotel
they
had
made
their
partiality
too
public
and
an
elderly
lady
not
far
away
in
the
vast
parlor
had
audibly
complained
that
they
brought
the
manners
of
the
into
the
they
talked
half
through
the
night
too
foster
added
bitterly
young
men
problems
said
randolph
possibly
they
were
considering
pearson
possibly
repeated
foster
and
neither
followed
further
for
a
moment
the
pathway
of
surmise
presently
randolph
rose
and
scuffled
through
the
ruck
of
newspapers
with
which
no
great
progress
had
been
made
is
medora
at
home
he
asked
i
think
she
off
at
church
said
foster
discontentedly
and
hortense
went
with
her
i
call
her
up
later
if
i
can
get
her
for
wednesday
and
pearson
too
foster
accustomed
to
piecing
loose
ends
as
well
as
he
could
did
not
ask
him
to
finish
randolph
picked
up
a
crumpled
sheet
from
the
floor
reseated
himself
and
read
out
the
account
of
yesterday
double
performance
at
the
opera
when
randolph
then
met
cope
in
the
vestibule
of
the
library
on
monday
he
felt
that
he
had
ground
under
his
feet
just
how
solid
just
how
extensive
he
was
not
quite
sure
but
he
could
safely
take
a
few
steps
experimentally
cope
was
a
picture
of
uncertainty
and
woe
his
face
was
an
open
bid
for
sympathy
and
aid
you
are
unhappy
said
randolph
and
i
think
i
know
why
he
meant
to
advance
toward
the
problem
as
if
it
were
a
case
of
jealousy
a
matter
of
pearson
intrusion
and
of
amy
seemingly
willing
acceptance
of
it
cope
soon
caught
randolph
idea
and
he
stared
he
did
not
at
all
resent
randolph
advances
misapprehension
in
fact
might
serve
as
fairly
in
the
end
as
the
clearest
understanding
randolph
placed
his
hand
on
cope
shoulder
you
have
only
to
assert
yourself
he
said
the
other
man
is
an
intruder
it
would
be
easy
to
warn
him
off
before
he
starts
in
to
win
her
george
pearson
said
cope
win
her
in
heaven
name
he
blurted
out
let
him
it
was
a
cry
of
distaste
and
despair
in
which
no
rival
was
concerned
randolph
now
had
the
situation
in
its
real
lines
well
this
is
no
place
for
a
talk
he
said
if
you
should
care
to
happen
in
on
me
some
evening
before
long
i
have
wednesday
returned
cope
with
eagerness
not
wednesday
i
have
an
engagement
for
that
evening
but
any
evening
a
little
later
friday
the
worst
of
my
week
work
is
over
by
then
friday
will
do
and
they
parted
randolph
had
secured
for
his
wednesday
evening
medora
phillips
and
hortense
hortense
was
the
young
person
to
pair
with
pearson
who
had
thrown
over
an
evening
at
his
club
for
the
dinner
with
randolph
the
talk
was
to
be
in
sections
and
installments
of
amy
leffingwell
and
of
cope
in
so
far
as
he
might
enter
medora
would
speak
hortense
would
speak
randolph
himself
should
speak
to
complete
the
party
he
had
asked
his
relations
from
the
far
side
of
the
big
city
his
sister
would
preside
for
him
and
his
might
justify
his
expenditure
of
time
and
trouble
by
stopping
off
in
advance
for
a
brief
confab
as
trustee
at
the
administration
building
with
the
president
a
compatriot
had
been
secured
by
to
help
in
and
kitchen
randolph
had
planned
a
short
dinner
his
sister
facing
the
long
would
doubtless
be
willing
to
leave
by
then
with
two
extraneous
pieces
removed
from
the
board
the
real
matter
in
hand
might
be
got
under
way
phillips
was
most
lively
from
the
start
she
praised
the
house
which
she
was
seeing
for
the
first
time
she
extolled
department
and
who
delighted
in
entertainments
was
one
broad
smile
she
had
a
word
of
encouragement
for
his
less
smiling
helper
whom
she
informally
christened
and
she
chatted
endlessly
with
brackett
perhaps
even
helped
tire
her
out
yes
george
pearson
was
to
be
urged
forward
for
the
rescue
of
bertram
cope
pearson
spoke
up
loud
and
clear
among
the
males
he
was
a
among
and
during
the
very
few
moments
formally
allowed
for
the
cigars
he
made
himself
as
he
felt
tell
and
after
the
bracketts
left
at
nine
he
was
easily
content
to
stay
on
for
of
an
hour
longer
at
pearson
was
saying
amidst
the
of
the
den
does
she
expect
to
teach
the
violin
all
her
life
he
was
both
ironical
and
impatient
clearly
a
charming
delicate
creature
like
amy
leffingwell
might
better
decorate
the
domestic
scene
of
some
gentleman
who
enjoyed
position
and
prosperity
i
hope
not
indeed
said
hortense
in
a
deep
contralto
pearson
cast
on
hortense
a
look
which
rewarded
such
discernment
of
course
he
has
nothing
now
said
randolph
with
deliberation
and
he
may
be
nothing
but
a
poor
underpaid
professor
all
his
life
no
ring
yet
said
hortense
further
her
yet
meant
not
even
yet
her
deep
tone
was
plausibly
indignant
i
rather
glad
of
that
remarked
phillips
with
an
eye
pretendedly
fixed
on
the
mexican
dolls
i
ca
feel
that
they
are
altogether
suited
to
each
other
he
does
care
for
her
pursued
hortense
does
she
really
care
for
him
asked
pearson
no
answer
one
pair
of
eyes
sought
the
floor
another
searched
the
ceiling
a
third
became
altogether
subordinate
to
questioning
brows
pearson
glanced
from
one
face
to
another
the
doubt
as
to
her
caring
seemed
universal
the
doubt
that
she
cared
deeply
essentially
was
one
that
he
had
brought
away
from
the
and
he
went
home
at
ten
pretty
well
determined
that
he
would
very
soon
try
to
change
doubt
to
certainty
thank
you
so
much
said
phillips
to
randolph
as
he
went
out
with
her
and
hortense
to
put
them
in
the
car
i
sure
we
do
want
him
to
be
burdened
and
miserable
and
i
sure
we
all
do
want
her
to
be
happy
george
is
a
lovely
capable
chap
and
really
he
has
quite
a
way
regains
his
on
friday
evening
randolph
at
home
was
glancing
now
and
then
at
the
clock
as
on
a
previous
occasion
while
waiting
for
cope
at
the
telephone
rang
it
was
cope
with
excuses
as
before
he
was
afraid
he
should
be
unable
to
come
some
unexpected
work
it
was
that
autumn
excursion
all
over
again
randolph
hung
up
the
receiver
with
some
impatience
still
never
mind
if
cope
would
make
no
effort
to
save
himself
others
were
making
the
effort
for
him
he
had
considerable
confidence
in
george
state
of
mind
as
well
as
in
george
egoism
and
drive
foster
heard
of
cope
new
delinquency
through
randolph
own
reluctant
admission
he
is
an
ingrate
after
all
said
foster
savagely
and
gave
his
wheels
an
exceptionally
violent
jerk
and
randolph
made
little
effort
this
time
toward
cope
defense
you
done
so
much
for
him
foster
went
on
and
you
willing
to
do
so
much
more
i
do
a
great
deal
of
course
there
may
be
a
good
reason
this
time
too
said
randolph
soberly
humph
returned
foster
cope
had
hung
up
the
receiver
to
turn
toward
lemoyne
and
to
say
i
really
ought
to
have
gone
wait
until
i
can
go
with
you
lemoyne
insisted
as
he
had
been
insisting
just
before
the
still
unseen
man
of
indian
rock
was
again
the
subject
of
his
calculations
you
been
asked
cope
submitted
he
has
been
very
friendly
to
me
and
i
am
sure
he
would
be
the
same
to
you
i
think
that
personally
i
can
get
along
without
him
the
other
muttered
ungraciously
to
himself
aloud
he
said
as
i
told
you
i
got
the
president
of
the
dramatic
club
to
see
tonight
and
it
high
time
that
i
was
leaving
he
looked
with
intention
at
the
desk
which
had
superseded
that
old
table
with
cover
at
which
cope
had
once
worked
you
can
use
a
little
time
to
advantage
over
those
themes
i
be
back
within
an
hour
lemoyne
had
entered
for
psychology
and
was
hoping
that
he
now
enjoyed
the
status
necessary
for
participation
in
the
college
theatricals
but
he
was
relying
still
more
on
a
sudden
defection
or
lapse
which
had
left
the
dramatic
club
without
a
necessary
actor
at
a
critical
time
me
or
postponement
he
said
and
i
think
it
me
the
new
opportunity
or
bare
chance
loomed
before
him
with
immensity
affair
might
wait
he
would
even
risk
cope
running
over
to
place
alone
cope
seated
himself
at
his
desk
with
loyalty
or
at
least
with
docility
and
lemoyne
putting
on
his
hat
and
coat
started
out
for
the
fraternity
house
where
the
president
of
the
club
was
in
residence
five
minutes
after
lemoyne
departure
cope
heard
the
telephone
ringing
downstairs
and
presently
a
patient
man
knocked
at
the
door
and
told
him
the
call
was
for
him
cope
sighed
apprehensively
and
went
down
of
course
it
was
amy
would
he
not
come
over
for
an
hour
everybody
was
away
and
they
could
have
a
quiet
talk
together
cope
conscious
of
others
in
the
house
replied
cautiously
lemoyne
he
said
had
gone
out
and
left
him
with
a
deskful
of
themes
tiresome
routine
work
but
necessary
and
immensely
absorptive
of
time
he
was
afraid
that
he
could
scarcely
come
this
evening
amy
voice
took
on
a
new
tone
why
she
seemed
to
be
feeling
must
arthur
lemoyne
be
mentioned
and
mentioned
so
early
yet
bertram
had
put
him
instinctively
unconsciously
at
the
head
of
the
little
verbal
procession
just
begun
cope
response
was
dry
and
meagre
free
speech
was
impossible
over
a
telephone
set
in
the
public
hall
amy
who
knew
little
of
cope
immediate
surroundings
at
the
moment
went
on
in
accents
of
protest
and
of
grievance
and
cope
went
on
replying
in
a
voice
as
as
he
was
able
he
dwelt
more
and
more
on
the
trying
details
of
his
work
in
words
which
conveyed
no
additional
information
to
any
who
might
overhear
you
have
been
to
see
me
for
a
week
came
amy
voice
petulantly
indignantly
i
very
sorry
i
sure
returned
cope
in
a
carefully
generalized
tone
of
suavity
it
was
successful
with
the
spinster
in
the
side
room
above
but
it
was
no
tone
to
use
with
a
protesting
why
do
you
neglect
me
so
amy
voice
proceeded
with
no
shade
of
appeasement
there
is
no
intention
of
that
replied
cope
so
far
as
i
know
he
added
for
ears
about
or
above
again
amy
tone
changed
it
took
on
a
tang
of
anger
and
also
a
curious
ring
of
finality
as
if
suddenly
a
last
resolution
had
been
reached
good
night
she
said
abruptly
and
the
interview
was
over
cope
forgot
randolph
and
lemoyne
and
his
themes
lemoyne
returning
within
the
hour
found
him
seated
at
his
desk
in
depression
his
work
untouched
well
they
taken
me
he
began
and
i
shall
have
a
fairly
good
part
cope
made
no
effort
to
respond
to
the
other
glowing
but
sat
with
thoughtful
downcast
eyes
at
his
desk
before
the
untouched
themes
what
the
matter
asked
lemoyne
has
she
been
calling
up
again
cope
raised
his
head
and
gave
him
a
look
lemoyne
saw
that
his
very
first
guess
had
been
correct
this
is
a
gay
life
he
broke
out
just
the
life
i
have
come
down
here
to
lead
you
making
yourself
miserable
and
you
making
me
miserable
it
got
to
end
cope
gave
him
a
second
woeful
glance
write
to
her
breaking
it
off
prompted
lemoyne
draft
a
letter
tonight
his
mind
was
full
of
from
his
reading
and
his
scripts
he
had
heard
all
the
necessary
things
said
in
fact
had
said
them
himself
now
in
evening
dress
now
in
hunting
costume
now
in
the
loose
habiliments
of
pierrot
time
and
time
again
the
dissatisfied
need
but
say
that
he
could
not
feel
after
all
that
they
were
as
well
suited
to
each
other
as
they
ought
to
be
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
his
feeling
for
her
was
what
love
really
should
be
and
that
thus
with
a
multiplicity
of
that
they
accomplished
a
rough
draft
which
might
be
restudied
and
used
on
the
morrow
there
said
lemoyne
to
the
weary
cope
at
eleven
it
ought
to
have
been
written
a
month
ago
cope
languidly
slipped
the
sheet
under
his
pile
of
themes
and
in
a
spent
voice
suggested
bed
over
night
and
through
the
following
forenoon
the
draft
lay
on
his
desk
when
he
returned
to
his
room
at
three
a
note
which
had
been
delivered
by
hand
awaited
him
it
was
from
amy
leffingwell
cope
read
it
folded
his
arms
on
his
desk
bowed
his
head
on
his
arms
and
being
alone
gave
a
then
he
lifted
his
head
with
face
illumined
and
soul
refreshed
amy
had
asked
for
an
end
to
their
engagement
what
does
she
say
asked
lemoyne
an
hour
later
she
says
what
you
say
exclaimed
cope
with
shining
eyes
and
a
trace
of
bravado
she
does
not
feel
that
we
are
quite
so
well
suited
to
each
other
as
we
ought
to
be
nor
that
her
feeling
toward
me
is
what
love
really
can
she
have
been
in
dramatics
too
your
letter
returned
lemoyne
with
dignity
would
have
been
understood
quite
so
cope
acknowledged
in
a
kind
of
exultant
excitation
he
caught
the
rough
draft
from
his
desk
it
was
all
seared
with
new
emendations
tore
it
up
and
threw
the
fragments
into
the
thank
heaven
i
have
had
to
send
it
in
a
moment
what
am
i
to
write
now
he
asked
with
irony
the
next
will
be
easier
returned
lemoyne
still
with
dignity
it
will
replied
cope
it
was
so
much
easier
that
it
became
but
an
elegant
literary
exercise
a
few
touches
of
nobility
a
few
more
of
elegiac
regret
and
it
was
ready
at
nine
that
night
for
the
cope
dropped
it
in
with
an
iron
clang
and
walked
back
to
his
quarters
a
free
man
a
few
days
later
lemoyne
working
for
his
new
play
met
amy
leffingwell
in
the
of
the
university
library
she
had
removed
her
gloves
with
their
furry
wristlets
and
he
saw
that
she
had
a
ring
on
the
third
finger
of
her
left
hand
its
scintillations
made
a
stirring
address
to
his
eye
cope
heard
about
the
ring
that
evening
and
about
amy
engagement
to
george
pearson
the
next
day
he
had
no
desire
to
dramatize
the
scene
of
pearson
advance
assault
and
victory
nor
to
visualize
the
setting
up
of
the
monument
by
which
that
victory
was
commemorated
lemoyne
did
it
for
him
pearson
had
probably
indulged
in
some
disparagement
of
cope
a
phase
on
which
lemoyne
as
a
faithful
friend
did
not
dwell
but
he
clearly
saw
george
taking
amy
hand
on
which
there
was
still
no
ring
and
declaring
that
she
should
be
wearing
one
before
tomorrow
night
he
figured
both
george
and
amy
as
rather
glad
that
cope
had
not
given
one
and
as
more
and
more
inclining
with
the
passage
of
the
days
to
the
comfortable
feeling
that
there
had
never
been
any
real
engagement
at
all
lemoyne
attempted
to
put
some
of
his
visualizings
before
cope
but
cope
cut
him
short
now
i
will
settle
down
to
work
on
my
thesis
he
said
and
get
my
degree
at
the
june
convocation
good
said
lemoyne
and
now
i
can
get
my
mind
on
the
club
he
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
on
the
night
the
stars
were
let
take
a
turn
round
the
block
before
we
turn
in
they
spent
ten
minutes
in
the
clear
winter
air
as
cope
on
their
return
stooped
to
put
his
to
use
lemoyne
impulsively
threw
an
arm
across
his
shoulder
everything
is
all
right
now
he
said
in
a
tone
of
high
gratification
and
urania
through
the
whole
width
of
her
starry
firmament
looked
down
kindly
upon
a
happier
household
in
danger
a
similar
satisfaction
came
to
prevail
in
university
circles
and
in
the
lesser
circle
which
cope
had
formed
outside
his
own
classroom
after
a
week
became
a
different
place
there
had
been
some
disposition
to
take
a
facetious
view
of
cope
adventure
his
class
had
felt
him
as
cool
and
rather
stiff
and
comment
would
not
be
stayed
one
bright
girl
thought
he
had
spoiled
a
good
suit
of
clothes
for
nothing
the
boys
who
knew
how
much
clothes
cost
and
how
much
every
suit
counted
put
their
comment
on
a
different
basis
the
more
serious
among
them
went
no
further
indeed
than
to
say
that
if
a
man
had
found
himself
making
a
mistake
the
sooner
he
got
out
of
it
the
better
for
weeks
this
affair
of
cope
had
hung
over
the
blackboard
like
a
dim
tapestry
now
it
was
gone
and
when
he
tabulated
in
chalk
the
elizabethan
dramatists
or
the
victorian
novelists
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
his
students
from
seeing
them
medora
phillips
became
sympathetic
and
tender
she
let
him
understand
that
she
thought
he
had
been
unfairly
treated
this
did
not
prevent
her
from
being
much
kinder
to
amy
leffingwell
amy
earlier
had
been
so
affected
by
the
general
change
of
tone
that
more
than
once
she
had
felt
prompted
to
take
herself
and
her
belongings
out
of
the
house
but
she
still
lingered
on
as
she
was
likely
to
do
during
a
short
engagement
and
phillips
was
now
amiability
itself
to
george
and
amy
both
her
method
of
soothing
cope
was
to
take
him
to
the
theatre
and
the
opera
in
town
he
could
scarcely
come
to
the
house
it
was
now
late
in
january
and
the
opera
season
was
near
its
end
people
were
tiring
of
their
boxes
or
had
started
south
it
had
become
almost
a
work
of
merit
to
fill
a
friend
box
for
her
during
the
last
week
of
the
season
phillips
was
put
in
position
to
do
this
she
invited
cope
and
took
along
hortense
and
found
in
the
city
itself
a
married
pair
who
could
get
to
the
place
and
home
again
without
her
help
lemoyne
would
have
made
six
and
the
third
man
but
he
was
not
bidden
why
pack
the
box
a
better
effect
was
made
by
presenting
negligently
one
empty
seat
lemoyne
dressed
cope
however
he
had
brought
to
churchton
the
outgrown
evening
clothes
and
cope
in
his
exuberance
bought
a
new
pair
of
light
shoes
and
white
gloves
he
looked
well
as
he
sat
on
the
back
seat
of
the
limousine
with
medora
phillips
during
the
long
drive
in
and
he
looked
well
strikingly
handsomely
well
in
the
box
itself
indeed
thought
medora
he
made
other
young
men
in
nearby
boxes
young
men
of
means
and
position
look
almost
plebian
he
is
charming
she
said
to
herself
over
and
over
again
what
about
him
took
her
was
it
his
slenderness
his
grace
was
it
his
youthfulness
intact
to
this
moment
and
promising
an
extension
of
agreeable
possibilities
into
an
entertaining
future
or
was
it
more
largely
his
fundamental
coolness
of
tone
again
he
was
an
icicle
on
the
temple
this
time
the
temple
of
song
he
is
glittering
said
medora
intent
on
his
blazing
blue
eyes
his
beautiful
teeth
ever
ready
for
a
public
smile
and
the
luminous
backward
sweep
of
his
hair
and
he
is
not
soft
she
thought
suddenly
of
arthur
lemoyne
he
by
comparison
seemed
like
a
dark
yielding
on
the
way
into
town
medora
had
had
hortense
sit
in
front
with
peter
this
arrangement
had
enabled
her
to
lay
her
hand
more
than
once
on
cope
and
to
tell
him
again
that
he
had
been
rather
badly
treated
and
that
amy
when
you
came
to
it
was
a
poor
slight
child
who
scarcely
knew
her
own
mind
i
hope
she
had
not
made
a
mistake
after
all
breathed
medora
all
this
soothed
cope
the
easy
motion
of
the
luxurious
car
him
a
scene
of
unaccustomed
splendor
and
brilliancy
lay
just
ahead
what
wonder
that
medora
found
him
scenically
gratifying
in
her
box
the
dear
creature
titillation
made
it
seem
hers
indeed
and
gave
his
name
with
great
gusto
to
the
young
woman
of
the
notebook
and
pencil
and
the
box
was
not
at
the
back
but
well
along
to
one
side
where
people
could
better
see
him
its
number
too
was
lower
so
that
next
morning
he
was
well
up
in
the
list
instead
of
at
the
extreme
bottom
where
two
or
three
of
the
young
men
of
means
and
position
found
themselves
some
of
the
girls
in
his
class
read
his
name
and
had
no
more
to
say
about
wet
clothes
hortense
on
the
front
seat
of
the
car
had
had
the
good
sense
to
say
little
and
the
acumen
to
listen
much
she
knew
that
cope
must
call
soon
and
she
knew
it
would
be
on
some
evening
when
he
had
been
advised
that
amy
was
not
at
home
there
came
before
long
an
evening
when
amy
and
george
pearson
went
into
town
for
a
musical
comedy
and
cope
walked
across
once
more
to
the
familiar
house
hortense
was
in
the
she
was
brilliantly
dressed
and
her
dark
aggressive
face
wore
a
look
of
bravado
in
her
rich
contralto
she
welcomed
cope
with
an
initiative
which
all
but
crowded
her
aunt
into
second
place
under
the
very
nose
of
medora
phillips
whom
she
breezily
seemed
to
regard
as
a
chaperon
she
brought
forward
the
sketch
of
cope
in
oils
which
she
had
done
partly
from
observation
and
partly
from
memory
she
may
have
had
too
some
slight
aid
from
a
photograph
one
which
her
aunt
had
wheedled
out
of
cope
and
had
missed
on
one
occasion
at
least
from
her
desk
in
the
library
hortense
now
boldly
asked
his
cooperation
for
finishing
her
small
canvas
though
the
of
last
autumn
legend
might
indeed
be
as
he
had
broadly
said
a
nice
enough
lot
of
girls
they
really
were
not
all
alike
and
indistinguishable
one
of
them
at
least
as
he
should
learn
had
thumbs
hortense
wheeled
into
action
the
composition
is
good
she
observed
looking
at
the
canvas
as
it
stood
propped
against
the
back
of
a
chippendale
chair
and
in
general
the
values
are
all
right
but
she
glanced
from
the
sketch
back
to
the
subject
of
it
cope
started
he
recognized
himself
readily
enough
however
he
had
had
no
idea
that
was
to
be
one
of
the
pleasures
of
his
but
i
shall
need
you
yourself
for
the
final
touches
the
ones
that
will
make
all
the
difference
it
pretty
good
as
it
is
declared
phillips
who
privately
was
almost
as
much
surprised
as
cope
when
did
you
get
to
do
it
this
inquiry
simple
as
it
was
put
the
canvas
in
a
new
light
that
of
an
icon
long
cherished
as
the
object
of
private
devotion
hortense
stepped
forward
to
the
chair
and
made
an
adjustment
of
the
position
she
had
a
flush
and
a
frown
to
conceal
but
never
mind
she
thought
as
she
turned
the
canvas
toward
a
slightly
different
light
if
aunt
medora
wants
to
help
let
her
she
did
not
reply
to
her
aunt
question
retouched
from
life
and
then
framed
who
knows
she
asked
of
course
it
would
look
immensely
better
would
look
in
fact
as
it
was
meant
to
look
as
she
could
make
it
look
she
told
cope
that
she
had
set
up
a
studio
near
the
town
square
not
far
from
the
and
the
elms
which
wo
count
for
much
at
this
time
of
year
interjected
her
aunt
well
the
light
is
good
returned
hortense
and
the
place
is
quiet
and
if
mr
cope
will
drop
in
two
or
three
times
i
think
he
will
end
by
feeling
that
i
have
done
him
justice
this
is
a
most
kind
attention
said
cope
slightly
at
sea
i
ought
to
be
able
to
find
time
some
afternoon
not
too
late
in
the
afternoon
hortense
cautioned
the
light
in
february
goes
early
when
lemoyne
heard
of
this
new
project
he
gave
cope
a
he
had
no
concern
as
to
phillips
who
was
for
him
but
a
rather
dumpy
little
woman
of
if
she
must
run
off
with
bert
every
so
often
in
a
he
could
manage
to
stand
it
besides
he
had
no
desire
to
shut
cope
and
himself
out
of
a
good
house
but
the
niece
scarcely
was
a
more
serious
matter
lookout
he
said
to
cope
lookout
i
can
take
care
of
myself
the
other
replied
rather
tartly
i
wish
you
could
retorted
lemoyne
with
poignant
brevity
i
go
with
you
you
wo
i
rather
save
you
near
the
start
than
have
to
try
at
the
very
end
cope
flung
himself
out
and
he
looked
in
at
hortense
studio
which
she
had
taken
or
borrowed
for
a
month
before
the
week
was
half
over
hortense
had
stepped
into
the
shoes
of
a
young
gentlewoman
who
had
been
trying
photography
and
who
had
rather
tired
of
it
at
any
rate
she
had
had
a
chance
to
go
to
florida
for
a
month
and
had
seized
it
hortense
had
succeeded
to
her
little
north
skylight
and
had
rearranged
the
rest
to
her
own
taste
it
was
a
mingling
of
order
and
disorder
of
calculation
and
of
careless
chance
she
had
a
victory
of
samothrace
and
a
dalmatic
from
some
tuscan
town
but
why
go
on
cope
had
not
been
in
this
new
milieu
fifteen
minutes
before
randolph
happened
along
randolph
as
a
friend
of
the
family
could
scarcely
be
other
than
persona
grata
hortense
however
gave
him
no
great
welcome
she
stopped
in
the
work
that
had
but
been
begun
the
winter
day
was
none
too
bright
and
the
best
of
the
light
would
soon
be
past
she
said
the
engagement
could
stand
over
in
any
event
he
was
there
he
of
course
meaning
cope
and
a
present
delay
would
only
add
to
the
total
number
of
his
calls
hortense
began
to
wipe
her
brushes
and
to
talk
of
tea
i
go
i
go
said
randolph
obligingly
i
heard
about
the
new
shop
only
yesterday
and
i
wanted
to
see
it
i
do
exact
that
i
shall
witness
the
mysteries
in
active
operation
cope
glance
asked
randolph
to
remain
there
are
no
mysteries
returned
hortense
it
just
putting
on
a
few
dabs
of
paint
in
the
right
places
she
continued
to
take
a
few
dabs
from
her
brushes
and
to
talk
tea
stay
for
a
sip
she
said
very
well
thank
you
replied
randolph
and
wondered
how
long
a
sip
might
mean
in
the
end
it
meant
no
longer
for
him
than
for
cope
they
came
away
together
hortense
held
cope
for
a
moment
to
make
a
second
engagement
at
an
earlier
hour
randolph
had
not
met
cope
for
several
days
except
at
the
opera
where
he
had
left
his
regular
monday
evening
seat
in
the
parquet
to
spend
a
few
moments
in
phillips
friend
box
he
had
never
seen
cope
in
evening
dress
before
but
he
found
him
handsome
and
distinguished
and
some
of
the
glamour
of
that
high
occasion
still
lingered
about
the
young
man
as
he
now
walked
through
high
street
in
his
rather
shabby
tweeds
at
randolph
side
randolph
looked
back
upon
his
dinner
as
a
complete
success
pearson
was
engaged
and
cope
was
free
he
now
said
to
cope
of
course
you
must
know
i
feel
you
were
none
too
handsomely
treated
george
is
a
pleasant
enterprising
fellow
but
somewhat
sudden
and
rapacious
if
he
is
happy
i
hope
you
are
no
less
happy
yourself
thus
he
resumed
the
subject
which
had
been
dropped
at
the
library
door
cope
shrank
a
little
and
randolph
felt
him
shrinking
he
fell
silent
he
understood
pain
sometimes
took
its
own
time
to
travel
and
reached
its
goal
by
a
slow
circuitous
route
he
thought
suddenly
of
his
bullfight
in
seville
years
before
he
had
sat
out
his
six
bulls
with
entire
composure
yet
back
in
america
some
time
later
he
had
encountered
a
bullfight
in
an
early
film
and
had
not
been
able
to
follow
it
through
cope
perhaps
was
beginning
to
feel
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
the
drag
at
his
vitals
the
thing
was
over
and
his
the
elder
man
own
part
in
it
successfully
accomplished
so
why
had
he
conventional
commentator
felt
the
need
of
further
words
he
let
the
unhappy
matter
drop
when
he
spoke
again
he
reminded
cope
that
the
invitation
for
himself
and
lemoyne
still
held
good
amy
had
been
swept
from
the
stage
but
lemoyne
a
figure
of
doubt
was
yet
in
its
background
i
must
have
a
randolph
declared
to
himself
and
find
out
what
he
comes
to
cope
had
shown
some
reluctance
to
meet
his
advances
a
reluctance
which
he
felt
was
not
altogether
cope
own
i
know
we
shall
be
glad
to
come
sometime
replied
cope
with
seeming
heartiness
this
heartiness
may
have
had
its
element
of
the
genuine
at
any
rate
here
was
another
good
house
from
which
no
one
need
shut
himself
out
without
good
cause
if
lemoyne
developed
too
extreme
a
reluctance
he
would
be
reminded
that
he
was
cherishing
the
hope
of
a
position
in
the
registrar
office
for
at
least
half
of
the
day
also
that
randolph
enjoyed
some
standing
in
university
circles
and
that
his
was
one
of
the
trustees
yes
indeed
continued
cope
in
a
further
corroboration
which
might
better
have
been
dispensed
with
you
will
be
welcome
replied
randolph
quietly
he
would
have
preferred
a
single
assurance
to
a
double
one
in
double
meanwhile
cope
and
lemoyne
refined
daily
on
the
details
of
their
new
menage
and
applied
themselves
with
new
to
their
respective
interests
cope
had
found
a
subject
for
his
thesis
in
the
great
field
of
english
literature
or
rather
in
a
narrow
bypath
which
traversed
one
of
its
corners
the
important
thing
as
he
frequently
reminded
lemoyne
was
not
the
thesis
itself
but
the
aid
which
it
might
give
his
future
it
will
make
a
difference
in
salary
of
three
or
four
hundred
dollars
he
declared
lemoyne
himself
gave
a
few
hours
a
week
to
psychology
in
its
humbler
ranges
there
were
ways
to
hold
the
attention
of
children
and
there
were
forms
of
advertising
calculated
to
affect
favorably
the
man
who
had
money
to
spend
in
addition
the
university
had
found
out
that
he
could
sing
as
well
as
act
and
something
had
been
said
about
a
place
for
him
in
a
musical
play
they
brought
their
quarters
into
better
order
and
this
despite
numerous
minor
disputes
the
last
new
picture
did
not
always
find
at
once
its
proper
place
on
the
wall
and
sometimes
there
were
discussions
as
to
whether
it
should
be
toast
or
rolls
and
whether
there
should
be
eggs
or
not
occasionally
sharp
tones
and
quivering
nostrils
but
commonly
amity
and
peace
they
were
seen
or
heard
of
as
going
about
a
great
deal
together
to
lectures
to
restaurants
to
entertainments
in
the
city
but
they
went
no
longer
for
the
present
to
ashburn
avenue
they
took
their
time
to
remember
randolph
repeated
invitation
and
there
was
as
yet
no
further
attendance
at
the
studio
in
the
square
for
any
reference
to
the
unfinished
portrait
was
likely
to
produce
sharp
tones
and
quivering
nostrils
indeed
other
invitations
began
to
come
to
cope
some
of
them
from
people
he
knew
but
slightly
he
wondered
whether
his
swoon
and
his
shipwreck
really
could
have
done
so
much
to
make
him
known
sometimes
when
these
cards
seemed
to
imply
but
a
simple
form
of
entertainment
at
a
convenient
hour
of
the
late
afternoon
he
would
attend
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
note
that
commonly
medora
phillips
was
present
she
was
always
in
active
circulation
as
he
put
it
and
there
he
let
things
lie
one
of
these
entertainments
was
an
afternoon
reception
of
ordinary
type
and
the
woman
giving
it
had
thrown
a
smallish
library
into
closer
communication
with
her
without
troubling
to
reduce
the
library
to
order
books
pamphlets
magazines
lay
about
in
profuse
carelessness
and
it
was
in
this
library
that
cope
and
medora
phillips
met
you
been
neglecting
me
she
said
but
how
can
i
he
began
yes
i
know
she
returned
generously
but
after
the
first
of
may
well
he
is
a
young
man
of
decisiveness
and
believes
in
quick
action
she
made
a
whiff
accompanied
by
an
outward
and
forward
motion
of
the
hands
she
was
wafting
amy
leffingwell
out
of
her
own
house
into
the
new
home
which
george
pearson
was
preparing
for
her
after
that
yes
after
that
of
course
phillips
was
handling
unconsciously
a
small
pamphlet
which
lay
on
the
library
table
it
was
a
magazine
of
verse
a
monthly
which
did
not
scorn
poets
because
they
happened
to
live
in
the
county
in
which
it
was
published
the
table
of
contents
was
printed
on
the
cover
and
the
names
of
contributors
were
arranged
in
order
down
the
side
phillips
carelessly
running
her
eye
over
it
while
thinking
of
other
things
was
suddenly
aware
of
the
name
of
carolyn
thorpe
what
this
she
asked
she
ran
her
eye
across
to
the
other
edge
of
the
cover
and
read
two
sonnets
well
well
she
observed
and
turned
to
the
indicated
page
and
when
in
the
world
she
asked
and
turned
back
to
the
cover
it
was
the
latest
issue
of
the
magazine
and
but
a
day
or
two
old
carolyn
in
print
at
last
she
exclaimed
why
is
this
splendid
then
she
returned
to
the
text
of
the
two
sonnets
and
read
the
first
of
them
part
of
it
aloud
well
she
gasped
this
is
ardent
this
is
outspoken
that
the
fashion
among
woman
poets
today
returned
cope
in
a
tone
they
gone
farther
and
farther
until
they
hardly
realize
how
far
they
gone
do
let
them
disturb
you
phillips
reread
the
closing
lines
of
the
first
sonnet
and
then
ran
over
the
second
good
heavens
she
exclaimed
when
was
a
girl
times
change
i
should
say
so
she
looked
from
the
magazine
to
cope
i
wonder
who
only
begetter
may
be
is
that
quite
fair
so
many
writers
think
it
unjust
and
even
obtuse
and
offensive
if
the
thing
is
put
on
too
personal
a
basis
it
all
just
an
imagined
situation
manipulated
artistically
phillips
looked
straight
at
him
bertram
cope
it
she
spoke
with
elation
these
sonnets
constituted
a
tribute
cope
she
knew
had
never
looked
three
times
all
told
at
carolyn
thorpe
yet
here
was
carolyn
saying
that
she
cope
dropped
his
eyes
and
slightly
flushed
i
wonder
if
she
knows
it
out
phillips
went
on
swiftly
did
you
i
cried
cope
in
dismay
you
were
taking
it
all
so
calmly
i
do
take
it
at
all
why
should
i
and
why
should
you
think
there
is
any
ref
because
i
so
and
i
suppose
oh
if
could
only
write
or
paint
or
play
or
something
cope
put
his
hand
wearily
to
his
forehead
the
arts
were
a
curse
so
were
gifted
girls
so
were
women
he
wished
he
were
back
home
smoking
a
quiet
cigarette
with
arthur
lemoyne
ryder
came
bustling
up
ryder
the
mathematical
lady
who
had
given
the
first
tea
of
all
i
have
just
heard
about
carolyn
poems
what
it
must
be
to
live
in
the
midst
of
talents
and
i
hear
that
hortense
has
finally
taken
a
studio
for
her
portraits
yes
replied
phillips
and
she
with
a
slight
emphasis
is
doing
mr
cope
picture
with
another
slight
emphasis
at
the
end
cope
felt
a
tremor
run
through
him
he
was
none
the
less
perturbed
because
medora
phillips
meant
obviously
no
offense
hortense
and
carolyn
were
viewed
as
but
her
delegates
they
were
doing
for
her
what
she
would
have
been
glad
to
be
able
to
do
for
herself
clearly
in
her
mind
there
was
not
to
be
another
amy
well
that
was
something
he
thought
he
laughed
uneasily
and
gave
the
enthusiastic
ryder
a
few
details
of
the
as
she
called
it
details
which
she
would
not
be
denied
i
must
call
on
dear
hortense
some
afternoon
she
said
do
returned
hortense
aunt
and
mention
the
place
let
keep
the
dear
girl
as
busy
as
possible
if
it
were
only
photographs
submitted
ryder
that
a
career
too
phillips
acknowledged
they
all
drifted
out
into
the
larger
room
ryder
left
them
perhaps
to
distribute
her
small
change
of
art
and
literature
through
the
crowd
you
not
forgetting
hortense
phillips
herself
said
before
leaving
him
by
no
means
cope
replied
i
hear
you
did
make
much
of
a
start
we
had
tea
returned
cope
with
satirical
intention
this
left
medora
phillips
unscathed
tea
puts
on
no
paint
she
observed
and
was
lost
in
the
press
it
need
not
be
assumed
that
knowledge
of
carolyn
thorpe
verse
gained
wide
currency
through
university
circles
but
there
was
a
copy
of
the
magazine
in
the
university
library
lemoyne
saw
it
there
he
scarcely
knew
whether
to
be
pleased
or
vexed
finally
he
decided
that
there
was
safety
in
numbers
if
cope
really
intended
to
go
to
that
studio
it
was
just
as
well
that
there
should
be
an
impassioned
poetess
in
the
background
and
it
was
just
as
well
that
cope
should
know
she
was
there
lemoyne
took
a
line
not
unlike
phillips
own
i
only
wish
there
were
more
of
them
he
declared
looking
up
from
his
desk
i
like
a
lady
barber
for
your
head
a
lady
shoemaker
for
your
feet
a
lady
psychologist
for
your
soul
stop
it
cried
cope
i
had
about
all
i
can
stand
if
you
want
to
live
in
peace
as
you
sometimes
say
do
your
share
to
keep
the
peace
you
going
to
have
another
sitting
i
am
how
can
i
get
out
of
it
you
do
want
to
get
out
of
it
well
after
all
the
attentions
they
shown
us
us
you
me
then
shall
i
be
so
uncivil
as
to
hold
back
it
might
not
displease
her
if
you
did
her
your
phillips
if
i
may
risk
a
guess
you
may
not
your
precious
can
wait
do
be
in
such
a
damned
hurry
to
use
it
it
had
better
be
used
in
time
it
had
better
not
be
used
at
all
drop
it
think
about
your
new
play
or
something
oh
the
devil
sighed
lemoyne
winnebago
seems
mighty
far
off
we
got
on
there
at
least
he
bent
again
over
his
desk
cope
put
down
his
book
and
came
across
there
were
tears
perhaps
in
his
eyes
the
moisture
of
vexation
or
of
contrition
or
of
both
we
can
get
along
here
too
he
said
with
an
arm
around
shoulder
let
hope
so
returned
lemoyne
softening
with
his
hand
pressed
on
cope
own
as
a
this
brief
exchange
might
have
passed
for
a
quarrel
and
a
reconciliation
and
the
reconciliation
seemed
to
call
for
a
seal
that
was
soon
set
by
another
of
randolph
patient
invitations
to
dinner
let
go
said
cope
i
got
to
go
again
sometime
i
do
care
about
it
very
much
replied
lemoyne
if
you
want
any
help
of
his
toward
a
position
time
passing
and
a
man
ca
be
expected
to
bestir
himself
much
for
another
man
never
even
seen
all
right
i
go
with
you
randolph
was
glad
to
see
cope
again
whom
he
had
not
met
since
the
half
hour
in
hortense
dunton
studio
he
was
also
glad
to
secure
finally
a
close
and
leisurely
look
at
lemoyne
lemoyne
took
the
same
occasion
for
a
close
and
leisurely
look
at
randolph
each
viewed
the
other
with
dislike
and
distrust
each
spoke
so
far
as
might
be
to
cope
or
through
him
who
was
prepared
to
smile
saw
few
smiles
elsewhere
and
became
sedate
even
glum
randolph
felt
a
physical
distaste
for
lemoyne
his
dark
eyes
were
too
liquid
his
person
was
too
plump
the
bit
of
black
bristle
beneath
his
nose
was
an
offense
his
aura
yet
who
can
say
anything
definite
about
so
indefinite
a
thing
as
an
aura
save
that
one
feels
it
and
is
attracted
or
repelled
by
it
lemoyne
on
his
side
developed
an
equal
distaste
or
repugnance
for
the
little
gray
man
as
he
called
randolph
to
himself
and
later
even
to
cope
though
randolph
speaking
justly
was
exactly
neither
gray
nor
little
lemoyne
noted
too
the
early
banishment
of
randolph
eyeglasses
which
disappeared
as
they
had
disappeared
once
or
twice
before
he
felt
that
randolph
was
trying
to
stay
young
rather
late
and
was
showing
himself
inclined
to
go
with
younger
men
longer
than
they
would
welcome
him
why
did
he
consort
with
people
of
his
own
age
and
kind
he
was
old
so
why
could
he
old
the
talk
led
through
cope
to
reminiscences
of
life
in
winnebago
randolph
presently
began
to
feel
lemoyne
as
a
variously
yet
equivocally
gifted
young
fellow
one
so
curiously
endowed
as
to
be
of
no
use
to
his
own
people
and
of
no
avail
for
any
career
they
were
able
to
offer
him
a
bundle
of
minor
talents
a
possible
delight
to
casual
acquaintances
but
an
exasperation
to
his
own
household
an
ornamental
skimmer
over
life
surfaces
when
not
a
false
fire
for
other
young
voyagers
along
life
coasts
yet
bertram
cope
admired
him
and
had
become
absorbed
in
him
their
life
in
that
northern
town
with
its
fringe
of
interests
educational
ecclesiastical
artistic
and
aquatic
had
been
intimate
fused
to
a
degree
randolph
began
to
realize
for
the
first
time
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
cultivating
cope
cope
was
a
field
already
occupied
a
niche
already
filled
while
randolph
was
gathering
through
cope
details
of
the
life
in
winnebago
lemoyne
was
gathering
through
cope
details
of
the
life
in
churchton
during
the
past
autumn
he
began
to
reconstruct
that
season
the
long
range
of
social
entertainments
the
proposed
fall
excursions
the
sudden
shifting
of
domicile
randolph
it
was
clear
had
tried
to
appropriate
cope
and
to
supplant
knowingly
or
unknowingly
closest
friend
lemoyne
became
impatient
over
the
fact
that
he
was
now
sitting
at
randolph
table
however
if
randolph
could
help
him
to
a
place
and
a
salary
that
would
make
some
amends
presently
cope
having
served
as
an
intermediary
became
the
open
centre
of
interest
his
thesis
was
brought
forward
as
a
suitable
subject
of
inquiry
and
comment
it
was
a
relief
to
have
come
to
a
final
decision
but
no
relief
was
in
sight
for
a
long
time
from
the
slavery
of
close
reading
every
moment
that
could
be
spared
from
his
classroom
was
given
up
to
books
authors
in
whom
he
might
be
interested
or
not
interested
but
who
must
be
gone
through
a
sort
of
academic
convention
said
cope
rather
wanly
but
a
necessary
one
his
eyes
had
begun
to
show
excessive
application
at
least
they
looked
tired
and
dim
his
color
too
was
paler
he
had
come
to
suggest
again
the
young
man
who
had
been
picked
up
from
medora
phillips
floor
and
laid
out
on
the
couch
in
her
library
and
who
had
shown
a
good
deal
of
pallor
during
the
few
days
that
followed
take
a
little
more
air
and
exercise
randolph
counselled
a
good
rule
always
for
everybody
said
lemoyne
with
a
withholding
of
all
tone
and
expression
i
believe
randolph
continued
that
you
are
losing
in
both
weight
and
color
that
would
be
no
advantage
to
yourself
and
it
might
complicate
miss
dunton
problem
it
perplexing
to
an
artist
when
one
subject
changes
under
one
very
eye
there
wo
be
much
time
for
sitting
from
now
on
observed
lemoyne
concisely
i
might
try
to
go
round
once
more
said
cope
in
fairness
if
there
are
to
be
higher
lights
on
my
cheekbones
and
lower
lights
for
my
eyes
an
hour
or
so
should
serve
to
settle
it
i
would
introduce
many
changes
into
my
eyes
and
cheekbones
if
i
were
you
said
randolph
lemoyne
was
displeased
he
thought
that
randolph
was
taking
advantage
of
his
position
as
host
to
make
an
observation
of
unwarranted
saliency
and
he
frowned
at
his
plate
cope
flushed
and
looked
at
his
the
talk
drifted
toward
dramatics
with
winnebago
once
more
the
background
but
the
foreground
was
occupied
by
a
new
musical
comedy
which
one
of
the
clubs
might
try
in
another
month
and
the
tone
became
more
cheery
who
had
come
in
with
a
maple
mousse
of
his
own
making
smiled
at
last
and
he
smiled
still
more
widely
when
at
the
end
of
the
course
his
chief
occidental
masterpiece
was
praised
also
provided
coffee
and
cigars
in
the
den
and
it
was
here
that
cope
felt
the
atmosphere
right
for
venturing
a
word
in
behalf
of
lemoyne
there
had
been
few
signs
of
relenting
in
winnebago
and
some
modest
source
of
income
would
be
welcome
in
fact
was
almost
necessary
of
course
work
increasing
in
the
offices
said
randolph
looking
from
one
young
man
to
the
other
and
of
course
i
have
directly
or
indirectly
some
slight
he
felt
no
promptings
to
lend
lemoyne
a
hand
yet
cope
himself
even
if
out
of
reach
might
at
least
remain
an
object
of
continuing
kindness
but
if
you
are
to
interest
yourself
in
some
new
undertaking
by
grayfriars
he
said
to
lemoyne
will
you
have
much
time
and
attention
to
give
to
oh
i
have
time
replied
lemoyne
jauntily
and
not
many
studies
half
a
day
of
routine
work
i
thought
of
course
i
not
a
manager
or
director
or
anything
like
that
i
should
just
have
a
part
of
moderate
importance
and
should
have
only
to
give
good
heed
to
rehearsals
well
said
randolph
thoughtfully
i
hope
you
can
do
something
put
in
cope
with
fervor
well
said
randolph
again
this
uncomfortable
and
unsatisfactory
dinner
of
three
presently
drew
to
its
end
i
have
made
it
four
said
randolph
to
foster
a
day
or
two
later
if
i
only
thought
of
it
in
time
do
want
to
meet
them
again
returned
foster
quickly
well
said
randolph
i
no
fondness
for
the
new
fellow
myself
but
and
i
do
care
about
the
other
either
randolph
sighed
this
was
plainly
one
of
foster
off
days
the
only
wonder
was
he
had
not
more
of
them
he
sat
in
darkness
with
few
diversions
occupations
ameliorations
his
mind
churned
mightily
on
the
scanty
materials
that
came
his
way
he
founded
big
guesses
on
nothings
he
raised
vast
speculative
edifices
on
the
slightest
of
premises
to
dislike
a
man
he
could
not
even
see
well
the
blind
and
the
had
their
own
intuitions
and
followed
their
own
procedures
then
you
would
advise
me
to
speak
a
word
for
him
for
them
certainly
not
rejoined
foster
with
all
promptness
they
treated
you
badly
they
put
you
off
and
they
came
finally
only
because
they
counted
on
getting
something
out
of
you
oh
i
would
say
that
of
cope
i
would
and
i
do
they
completely
wrapped
up
in
their
own
interests
and
in
each
other
and
they
coupled
to
get
anything
they
can
out
of
number
three
or
out
of
number
four
or
five
or
out
of
x
the
world
that
is
to
say
randolph
shrugged
this
was
one
of
foster
bad
days
indeed
and
what
this
i
hear
about
hortense
asked
foster
with
bitterness
that
wo
amount
to
much
it
wo
she
out
in
the
open
finally
she
took
that
place
for
a
month
with
one
express
object
to
get
him
there
paint
or
no
paint
she
fretful
and
cantankerous
over
every
day
of
delay
and
soon
be
in
an
undisguised
rage
what
does
her
aunt
say
to
it
she
beginning
to
be
vexed
she
losing
patience
she
thinks
it
a
mistake
and
an
immodest
one
she
wants
to
send
her
away
for
a
visit
to
think
of
it
as
soon
as
one
girl
lets
go
another
takes
hold
and
a
third
person
holds
on
through
all
joe
joe
but
foster
was
not
to
be
stayed
and
that
poetry
of
carolyn
medora
herself
came
up
and
read
it
to
me
it
was
a
she
thought
that
wo
amount
to
anything
at
all
it
wo
with
hortense
scornfully
ridiculing
it
and
carolyn
bursting
into
tears
before
she
can
make
her
bolt
from
the
room
and
amy
wondering
whether
after
all
if
things
are
as
bad
as
they
are
for
me
up
here
how
much
worse
must
they
be
for
the
rest
of
them
below
and
that
confounded
engagement
has
made
it
still
worse
all
round
randolph
ran
his
palms
over
his
perplexed
temples
whose
whose
no
wonder
you
ask
engagements
then
when
are
they
going
to
be
married
the
first
week
in
may
i
hear
but
pearson
is
trying
for
the
middle
of
april
his
flat
is
taken
foster
writhed
in
his
chair
why
do
they
care
for
him
he
burst
out
he
nothing
in
himself
and
he
cares
nothing
for
them
and
he
cares
nothing
for
you
foster
added
boldly
all
he
has
thought
for
is
that
fellow
from
up
north
do
ask
me
why
they
care
replied
randolph
with
studied
sobriety
why
does
anybody
care
and
for
what
for
the
thing
that
is
just
out
of
reach
he
cool
he
selfish
he
indifferent
yet
somehow
frost
and
fire
join
end
to
end
and
make
the
circle
complete
he
fell
into
reflection
it
all
like
children
straining
upward
for
an
icicle
and
presently
slipping
with
cracked
pates
on
the
ice
below
well
pate
is
cracked
unless
it
the
worst
cracked
of
all
foster
tore
off
his
shade
and
threw
it
on
the
floor
mine
he
cried
look
to
your
own
joe
said
randolph
rising
that
wo
quite
do
be
a
fool
along
with
the
others
if
you
will
retorted
foster
oh
he
went
on
have
i
seen
it
all
have
i
felt
it
all
you
basil
randolph
mind
your
own
ways
too
randolph
thought
of
words
but
held
his
tongue
words
led
to
other
words
and
he
might
soon
find
himself
involved
in
what
would
seem
like
a
defense
an
attitude
which
he
did
not
relish
a
course
of
which
he
did
not
acknowledge
the
need
poor
joe
he
thought
sitting
too
much
by
himself
and
following
the
art
of
putting
things
together
anyhow
joe
foster
must
have
more
company
and
different
things
to
consider
what
large
standard
work
what
history
biography
or
bulky
mass
of
memoirs
in
from
four
to
eight
volumes
would
be
the
best
to
begin
on
before
the
winter
should
be
too
far
spent
four
or
five
days
later
randolph
wrote
to
cope
that
there
was
a
good
prospect
for
a
small
position
in
the
administration
offices
of
the
university
and
a
week
later
lemoyne
was
in
that
position
cope
who
recognized
randolph
handling
of
the
matter
as
a
personal
favor
replied
in
a
tone
of
some
warmth
he
really
a
very
decent
fellow
after
all
of
course
he
is
pronounced
randolph
lemoyne
himself
wrote
more
tardily
and
more
coolly
he
was
taking
time
from
his
psychology
and
from
the
antics
of
annabella
it
appeared
to
acquaint
himself
with
the
routine
of
his
new
position
randolph
shrugged
he
must
wait
to
see
which
of
the
three
interests
would
be
held
the
most
important
escapes
a
lemoyne
first
week
in
his
new
berth
held
him
rather
close
and
cope
was
able
to
move
about
with
less
need
of
accounting
for
his
every
hour
one
of
his
first
concerns
was
to
get
over
his
sitting
with
hortense
dunton
his
sitting
he
said
it
was
to
be
the
first
the
only
and
the
last
he
came
into
her
place
with
a
show
of
confidence
a
kind
of
blustery
bonhomie
i
give
you
an
hour
from
my
treadmill
he
declared
brightly
so
many
books
and
such
dry
ones
hortense
who
had
been
moping
brightened
too
i
thought
you
had
forgotten
me
she
said
chidingly
yet
her
tone
had
less
acerbity
than
that
which
she
had
employed
but
a
few
moments
before
to
address
him
in
his
absence
for
she
often
had
in
mind
at
intervals
longer
or
shorter
cope
improvisation
about
the
sassafras
too
truly
that
shrub
had
failed
to
understand
the
young
ladies
and
their
needs
my
thesis
he
said
from
now
on
it
must
take
a
lot
of
my
thought
and
every
moment
of
my
spare
time
he
looked
at
the
waiting
canvas
clinch
it
hurry
it
through
he
spoke
with
a
factitious
vivacity
which
almost
gave
a
sense
of
chill
she
looked
at
him
with
a
shade
of
dissatisfaction
and
discomfort
what
must
it
all
be
done
in
a
drive
she
asked
by
no
means
watch
me
relax
is
that
my
chair
see
me
drop
into
complete
physical
and
mental
passivity
the
of
the
arabs
he
mounted
the
sank
into
the
wide
chair
and
placed
his
hands
luxuriously
on
its
arms
his
general
pose
mattered
little
she
had
not
gone
beyond
his
head
and
shoulders
hortense
stared
would
he
push
her
on
the
moment
into
the
right
mood
would
he
have
her
call
into
instant
readiness
her
colors
and
brushes
why
even
a
modest
amateur
must
be
allowed
her
minutes
of
preparation
and
approach
passivity
she
repeated
beginning
to
get
under
way
shall
i
find
you
very
entertaining
in
that
condition
entertaining
me
the
sitter
why
i
always
heard
it
was
an
important
part
of
a
work
to
keep
the
subject
interested
and
amused
he
smiled
in
his
cold
distant
way
the
north
light
cut
across
the
forehead
nose
and
chin
which
made
his
priceless
profile
the
canvas
itself
done
on
theory
in
a
lesser
light
looked
dull
and
lifeless
hortense
felt
this
herself
she
did
not
see
how
she
was
going
to
key
it
up
in
a
single
hour
as
she
considered
among
her
brushes
and
tubes
she
began
to
feel
nervous
and
her
temper
stirred
you
have
a
great
capacity
for
being
interested
and
amused
she
said
most
men
are
like
you
especially
young
ones
they
are
amused
diverted
entertained
and
there
it
ends
cope
felt
the
prick
well
we
are
bidden
he
said
and
we
come
too
many
of
us
have
little
to
offer
in
return
except
appreciation
and
goodwill
how
better
appreciate
such
kindness
as
phillips
than
by
gratefully
accepting
more
of
it
stilted
talk
and
he
knew
it
you
have
been
accepting
much
of
it
lately
she
returned
feeling
the
point
of
a
new
brush
she
spoke
with
the
consciousness
of
empty
evenings
that
might
have
been
full
hardly
he
replied
and
he
felt
that
this
one
word
sufficed
well
the
coast
will
be
clear
after
the
twentieth
of
april
that
is
the
date
then
is
it
the
more
he
thought
of
the
impending
ceremony
the
more
grateful
he
was
for
his
escape
thankfulness
had
salved
the
earlier
wound
no
pain
now
came
from
his
touching
it
yes
on
that
day
the
house
will
see
the
last
of
them
the
wedding
then
will
yes
aunt
medora
says
go
to
iowa
you
at
home
here
why
indeed
drag
george
away
out
to
fort
lodge
let
her
own
people
who
are
not
many
come
to
us
aunt
will
do
everything
and
do
it
handsomely
she
slanted
her
palette
and
looked
toward
the
skylight
cope
own
glance
swept
the
green
burlap
walls
both
of
them
were
seeing
pictures
of
the
wedding
preparations
hortense
saw
at
the
front
door
with
things
that
must
be
held
to
the
light
or
draped
over
chairs
she
saw
george
haling
amy
to
the
and
to
the
dealers
in
she
saw
them
in
cosy
shaded
confab
evening
after
evening
in
her
aunt
library
it
was
a
period
of
joy
of
of
unsettlement
of
longing
of
irritation
of
exasperation
oh
would
it
never
end
cope
saw
a
long
string
of
gifts
and
entertainments
a
diamond
a
apartment
how
in
the
world
could
he
himself
have
compassed
all
this
and
how
blessed
was
he
among
men
that
he
had
not
been
obliged
to
try
hortense
went
through
some
motions
with
her
brush
yet
seemed
to
be
looking
beyond
him
rather
than
at
him
there
will
be
a
of
a
week
or
so
she
concluded
and
they
will
be
in
their
new
home
on
the
first
of
may
very
good
said
cope
he
thought
he
was
thinking
to
himself
but
he
spoke
aloud
and
that
ends
it
this
last
he
really
did
say
to
himself
he
sank
more
comfortably
into
his
chair
kept
his
face
properly
immobile
and
spoke
no
further
word
hortense
brought
back
her
gaze
to
focus
and
worked
on
for
a
little
time
in
silence
the
light
was
good
her
palette
was
full
her
brushes
were
her
eyes
were
intent
on
his
face
it
was
a
handsome
face
displayed
to
the
best
advantage
she
might
look
as
long
as
she
liked
and
a
long
look
preceded
every
stroke
presently
she
paused
opening
her
eyes
wider
and
holding
aloft
her
brush
there
will
be
a
she
said
the
deuce
he
thought
that
did
end
it
but
he
said
no
thing
aloud
guess
who
why
how
should
guess
she
cried
peremptorily
in
a
tone
of
bitter
derision
you
wo
well
it
carolyn
our
poor
silly
carolyn
and
what
do
you
suppose
she
has
started
in
to
do
she
is
writing
an
epitha
an
epithal
amium
contributed
cope
an
yes
an
repeated
hortense
with
an
outburst
of
jarring
laughter
is
she
absurd
is
she
ridiculous
is
she
why
it
seems
to
me
a
delicate
attention
a
very
sweet
thought
if
carolyn
could
make
anything
out
of
amy
and
of
george
why
let
her
do
it
you
her
poetry
cried
hortense
in
a
high
strained
voice
you
enjoy
her
epithalamiums
and
her
sonnets
cope
flushed
and
began
to
grow
impatient
she
is
a
sweet
girl
he
said
and
if
she
wishes
to
write
verse
she
is
quite
within
her
rights
there
you
go
again
twice
she
ought
to
know
perhaps
she
does
know
everybody
else
knows
and
perhaps
she
does
cried
hortense
tell
her
tell
her
cope
stared
she
is
a
sweet
girl
he
repeated
and
she
has
been
filling
very
discreetly
a
somewhat
difficult
position
he
knew
something
of
the
suppressed
bitterness
which
in
subordinate
places
was
often
the
lot
of
the
pen
he
found
himself
preferring
just
here
pen
to
typewriter
he
would
give
carolyn
a
touch
of
idealization
though
she
had
afflicted
him
with
a
heavy
stroke
of
embarrassment
position
shrilled
hortense
with
aunt
medora
the
very
soul
of
kindness
i
like
that
well
if
you
want
to
rescue
her
from
her
difficult
position
do
it
if
you
admire
her
and
love
her
tell
her
so
be
grateful
just
read
those
sonnets
over
again
hortense
dropped
her
palette
and
brushes
and
burst
into
outrageous
tears
cope
sat
bolt
upright
in
that
spacious
chair
tell
her
i
have
nothing
to
tell
her
i
have
nothing
to
tell
anyone
his
resonant
words
cut
the
air
they
uttered
decision
he
did
not
mean
to
make
the
same
mistake
twice
hortense
drew
across
her
eyes
an
apron
redolent
of
turpentine
and
stepped
toward
the
throne
nothing
why
this
sudden
refuge
in
silence
she
asked
almost
truculently
even
if
tremulously
you
usually
find
enough
words
even
though
they
mean
little
i
afraid
i
do
he
admitted
cautiously
you
have
nothing
to
tell
anyone
nothing
to
tell
me
cope
rose
nothing
to
tell
anyone
he
repeated
then
let
me
tell
you
something
there
was
an
angry
thrill
in
her
voice
for
i
am
not
so
selfish
and
as
you
are
i
have
seen
nobody
but
you
all
these
months
i
have
never
tried
harder
to
please
anybody
you
have
scarcely
noticed
me
you
have
never
given
me
a
glance
or
a
thought
you
could
interest
yourself
in
that
silly
amy
and
in
our
foolish
carolyn
but
for
me
me
nothing
cope
came
down
from
the
throne
if
she
had
lavished
her
maiden
thoughts
on
him
by
day
or
evening
or
at
night
he
had
not
known
and
could
hardly
be
supposed
to
know
indeed
she
had
begun
by
treating
him
with
a
cursory
roughness
nor
had
he
noticed
any
great
softening
later
on
listen
he
said
under
the
stress
of
embarrassment
and
alarm
his
cold
blue
eyes
grew
colder
and
his
delicate
nostrils
quivered
with
an
effect
a
little
too
like
disdain
i
like
you
as
well
as
another
no
more
no
less
i
am
in
no
position
to
think
of
love
and
marriage
and
i
have
no
inclination
that
way
i
am
willing
to
be
friends
with
everybody
and
nothing
more
with
anybody
the
sentences
came
with
the
cruel
detachment
of
bullets
but
not
again
not
twice
was
his
uppermost
thought
any
bluntness
any
ruggedness
rather
than
another
month
like
that
of
the
past
holiday
season
he
took
a
step
away
and
looked
to
one
side
toward
the
couch
where
his
hat
and
coat
were
lying
go
if
you
will
she
said
and
go
as
soon
as
you
like
you
are
a
contemptible
ingrate
you
have
grudged
me
every
minute
of
your
company
everywhere
and
every
second
you
have
given
me
here
if
i
have
been
foolish
it
is
over
now
and
there
shall
be
nothing
to
record
my
folly
she
stepped
to
the
easel
and
hurled
the
canvas
to
the
floor
where
it
lay
with
palette
and
brushes
cope
stood
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
his
coat
over
his
arm
he
seemed
to
see
the
open
volume
of
some
printed
play
after
all
there
was
a
type
which
even
under
emotional
stress
gave
a
measure
of
instinctive
heed
to
structure
and
cadence
well
if
there
was
relief
for
her
in
words
he
could
stand
to
hear
her
speak
for
a
moment
or
two
more
not
longer
one
word
yet
she
said
in
a
panting
voice
your
arthur
lemoyne
that
preposterous
friendship
can
not
go
on
for
long
you
will
tire
of
him
or
more
likely
he
will
tire
of
you
something
different
something
better
will
be
needed
and
you
will
live
to
learn
so
i
should
be
glad
if
i
never
saw
either
one
of
you
again
she
turned
her
stormy
face
away
and
cope
slipped
out
with
a
blended
sense
of
mortification
pain
and
relief
absent
from
a
cope
went
out
on
the
square
with
his
being
if
hortense
on
another
occasion
had
thrown
a
dash
of
brine
on
this
occasion
she
had
rubbed
in
the
salt
itself
and
he
had
struck
a
harsh
blow
in
turn
the
flat
of
his
mind
was
still
stinging
as
if
half
the
shock
of
the
blow
had
remained
behind
but
it
was
no
time
for
he
muttered
to
himself
not
again
not
twice
he
repeated
hortense
remained
for
several
days
in
a
condition
of
sullen
anger
she
was
a
cloud
lit
up
by
occasional
unaccountable
flashes
of
temper
whatever
in
the
world
is
the
matter
with
her
asked
her
aunt
in
more
directions
than
one
and
amy
leffingwell
blissfully
busy
over
her
little
trousseau
and
her
selection
of
protested
and
opened
wide
inquiring
blue
eyes
against
the
intrusion
of
such
a
spirit
at
such
a
joyous
time
but
hortense
though
better
days
intervened
now
and
then
did
not
improve
essentially
and
she
contrived
at
the
climacteric
moment
of
amy
career
to
make
herself
felt
unduly
felt
after
all
the
wedding
took
place
during
the
latter
half
of
april
as
demanded
by
the
enterprising
wooer
then
there
would
be
a
rapid
followed
by
a
prompt
occupancy
of
the
new
apartment
on
the
first
of
may
exactly
pearson
parents
prepared
to
welcome
amy
handsomely
and
her
own
people
some
of
them
came
on
from
iowa
to
attend
the
ceremony
there
was
her
mother
who
had
been
rather
disconcerted
by
the
sudden
shift
but
who
was
satisfied
with
george
pearson
the
moment
she
saw
him
and
who
found
him
even
more
vivid
and
agreeable
than
amy
photograph
of
him
had
led
her
to
expect
there
was
the
aunt
who
had
lived
a
bare
starved
life
and
who
luxuriated
along
with
her
sister
in
the
splendor
of
the
louis
quinze
chamber
and
there
was
a
friendly
brother
of
fourteen
who
was
tucked
away
in
the
chintz
room
up
stairs
whence
he
issued
to
fraternize
in
the
with
joe
foster
whose
exacerbated
spirit
he
did
much
to
soothe
this
young
brother
was
alert
cheery
chatty
he
was
not
at
all
put
out
by
foster
wheeled
chair
and
eyeshade
nor
by
the
strange
contortions
which
foster
went
through
when
on
occasion
he
left
the
chair
for
a
couch
or
for
some
chair
of
ordinary
type
he
got
behind
the
wheels
and
together
they
made
the
tour
of
the
landscapes
marines
and
which
covered
the
walls
the
boy
was
sympathetic
without
being
obtrusively
so
and
his
comments
on
the
paintings
were
confident
and
unconventional
so
different
from
pelouse
said
foster
with
a
grimace
he
enjoyed
immensely
the
fragmental
given
him
through
those
two
days
his
young
companion
was
lavish
in
his
reports
on
life
vast
vicissitudes
at
fort
lodge
and
was
always
ready
with
comparisons
between
things
as
observed
in
his
home
town
and
in
churchton
itself
he
came
as
a
tonic
breeze
and
the
evening
after
he
departed
foster
left
moping
alone
in
the
which
followed
the
festivities
said
to
himself
more
than
once
if
i
had
had
a
boy
i
should
have
wanted
him
just
like
dick
dick
mother
and
aunt
stood
up
as
well
as
they
could
against
the
bustling
emphatic
geniality
of
medora
phillips
and
they
were
able
after
a
little
to
adjust
themselves
to
the
prosperity
of
the
pearsons
these
they
came
to
feel
were
essentially
of
the
same
origin
and
traditions
as
themselves
just
plain
people
who
however
had
settled
on
the
edge
of
the
big
town
to
make
money
and
had
made
it
pearson
the
elder
was
hardly
more
prepotent
than
lusk
the
banker
at
home
george
himself
was
a
dashing
if
he
turned
into
a
tired
his
wife
would
know
how
to
divert
him
medora
phillips
provided
rice
also
she
satisfied
herself
as
to
where
if
the
newer
taste
were
not
too
delicate
she
could
put
her
hand
on
an
old
shoe
she
was
happy
to
have
married
off
amy
she
would
be
still
happier
once
amy
got
away
more
room
would
be
left
for
other
young
people
by
other
young
people
she
meant
of
course
certain
young
men
by
certain
young
men
she
thought
she
meant
cope
and
lemoyne
of
course
she
meant
cope
only
if
carolyn
keeps
amiable
and
if
hortense
contrives
to
regain
her
we
may
have
some
pleasant
days
yet
she
mused
but
hortense
did
not
regain
her
she
did
not
even
maintain
her
in
the
end
the
ceremony
was
too
much
for
her
george
and
amy
had
plighted
their
troth
in
a
floral
bower
which
ordinarily
was
a
bay
window
before
a
minister
of
a
denomination
which
did
not
countenance
robes
nor
a
ritual
lifted
beyond
the
chances
of
wayward
improvisation
and
after
a
brief
reception
the
new
couple
prepared
for
the
dash
which
was
to
take
them
to
a
late
train
in
the
big
wide
hallway
after
amy
had
kissed
carolyn
and
thanked
her
for
her
poem
and
was
preparing
for
the
shower
of
rice
which
she
had
every
reason
to
think
she
must
face
there
was
a
burst
of
hysterical
laughter
from
somewhere
behind
and
hortense
dunton
to
the
sufficing
words
o
bertram
bertram
emitted
with
sufficing
clearness
fainted
away
her
words
if
not
heard
by
all
the
company
were
heard
by
a
few
to
whom
they
mattered
and
while
hortense
immediately
after
the
departure
of
the
happy
pair
was
being
revived
and
led
away
they
left
occasion
for
thought
carolyn
thorpe
cast
a
startled
glance
the
aunt
from
iowa
who
knew
that
bertrams
did
not
grow
on
every
bush
and
whose
senses
the
function
had
preternaturally
sharpened
for
any
address
from
romance
seized
and
shook
her
sister
arm
and
later
on
in
a
louis
quinze
up
stairs
they
agreed
that
if
young
cope
really
had
had
another
claimant
on
his
attention
it
was
all
the
better
that
their
amy
had
ended
by
taking
george
and
medora
phillips
in
the
front
hall
itself
well
to
medora
phillips
in
the
front
hall
much
was
revealed
as
in
a
and
the
revelation
was
far
from
agreeable
what
advantage
in
amy
departure
if
hortense
continued
to
cumber
the
ground
hortense
must
go
off
somewhere
for
a
sojourn
of
a
month
or
more
to
recover
her
health
and
spirits
and
to
let
the
house
recover
its
accustomed
tone
of
cheer
medora
forced
these
considerations
to
the
back
of
her
mind
and
saw
most
of
her
guests
out
of
the
house
toward
the
end
of
it
all
she
found
herself
relaxing
in
the
library
with
basil
randolph
in
the
opposite
chair
randolph
himself
had
figured
in
the
ceremony
this
had
been
a
crude
imitation
of
a
form
and
had
allowed
for
an
extemporaneous
prayer
and
for
a
brief
address
to
the
young
couple
but
it
had
retained
the
familiar
inquiry
who
giveth
who
give
asked
medora
of
amy
poor
joe
was
rather
out
of
the
question
and
brother
dick
was
four
or
five
years
too
young
was
there
then
anyone
really
available
except
that
kind
randolph
so
basil
randolph
after
remembering
amy
with
a
rich
and
handsome
present
had
taken
on
a
paternal
air
had
stepped
forward
at
the
right
moment
and
was
now
recovering
from
his
novel
experience
the
two
as
they
sat
there
said
little
though
they
looked
at
each
other
with
questioning
glances
medora
indeed
improvised
a
little
stretch
of
silent
dialogue
and
it
made
him
take
his
share
she
felt
dislocated
almost
defeated
hortense
performance
had
set
her
to
thinking
of
bertram
cope
and
she
figured
the
same
topic
as
uppermost
in
the
mind
of
basil
randolph
well
you
have
about
beaten
me
she
said
how
so
she
made
him
ask
with
an
affectation
of
simplicity
you
know
well
enough
she
returned
you
have
played
off
the
whole
university
against
my
poor
house
and
you
have
won
your
influence
with
the
president
your
brother
on
the
board
of
trustees
if
bertram
cope
has
any
gratitude
in
his
composition
oh
well
she
let
him
say
i
do
feel
that
i
did
much
and
i
not
sure
i
glad
for
what
i
did
do
you
may
regret
it
of
course
that
other
man
is
an
uncertain
quantity
oh
come
he
said
you
had
the
inside
track
from
the
very
start
this
house
and
everything
in
it
you
have
a
house
of
your
own
now
your
dinners
and
entertainments
you
have
your
own
your
limousine
your
chauffeur
running
to
the
opera
and
heaven
knows
where
else
taxis
can
always
be
had
yes
she
went
on
you
have
held
the
advantage
over
a
poor
woman
cooped
up
in
her
own
house
while
i
have
had
to
stick
here
attending
to
my
housekeeping
you
have
been
careering
about
everywhere
you
with
a
lot
of
partners
and
clerks
in
your
office
and
no
compulsion
to
look
in
more
than
two
or
three
times
a
week
of
you
can
run
to
theatres
and
clubs
i
wonder
they
do
dispense
with
you
altogether
there
the
advantage
of
a
business
arranged
to
run
itself
so
far
as
am
concerned
yes
you
have
had
the
world
to
range
through
shows
and
restaurants
the
whole
big
city
strolls
and
excursions
and
who
knows
what
beside
thus
medora
phillips
continued
silently
and
with
no
exact
sense
of
justice
to
work
up
her
grievance
presently
she
surprised
randolph
with
a
positive
frown
she
had
made
a
quick
darting
return
to
hortense
i
shall
send
her
away
she
said
aloud
the
girl
might
join
her
studio
friend
who
had
stopped
at
asheville
on
her
way
north
and
stay
with
her
for
a
few
weeks
yes
hortense
might
go
and
meet
the
spring
or
even
the
summer
if
that
must
be
the
spring
here
in
town
she
herself
would
take
as
it
came
i
shall
welcome
a
few
free
easy
breaths
after
this
past
fortnight
she
finished
audibly
randolph
squared
himself
with
her
mood
as
best
he
could
you
are
tired
and
nervous
he
said
with
banality
get
the
last
of
us
out
and
go
to
bed
i
lead
the
way
and
will
give
these
loiterers
as
marked
an
example
as
possible
medora
phillips
hushed
down
her
house
finally
and
went
thoughtfully
up
stairs
to
her
room
amy
had
gone
off
and
hortense
was
sentenced
to
go
there
remained
only
carolyn
was
there
any
threat
in
her
and
her
sonnets
again
in
the
medora
treated
hortense
to
a
few
cautious
soundings
decided
that
another
locale
was
the
thing
to
do
her
good
and
sent
her
south
forthwith
it
a
low
latitude
she
said
to
herself
but
it
a
high
altitude
the
season
is
late
but
she
wo
suffer
hortense
who
had
been
sullen
and
fractious
met
her
aunt
and
agreed
passively
when
medora
said
it
will
benefit
you
to
see
the
spring
come
on
in
a
new
scene
and
in
a
new
fashion
you
will
find
the
mountains
more
interesting
than
the
dunes
so
hortense
packed
her
things
and
joined
her
friend
for
a
brief
sojourn
in
sight
of
the
great
smokies
thus
when
medora
herself
went
forth
to
meet
the
spring
among
the
she
had
only
carolyn
and
the
other
members
of
her
domestic
staff
yet
no
simplest
without
a
guest
or
so
and
she
asked
cope
to
accompany
them
you
need
it
she
told
him
bluntly
you
need
a
change
however
slight
and
brief
you
are
positively
thin
you
make
me
wish
that
thesises
theses
cope
corrected
her
rather
that
theses
then
had
never
been
invented
to
speak
familiarly
you
are
almost
cope
with
the
first
warm
days
had
gone
back
to
the
blue
serge
suit
of
the
past
autumn
and
he
filled
it
even
less
well
than
before
and
his
face
was
thin
to
correspond
besides
she
went
on
we
need
you
it
will
be
a
kind
of
for
a
day
or
two
merely
that
we
must
have
your
help
to
pitch
the
tent
so
to
speak
and
to
pick
up
firewood
and
to
fry
the
bacon
and
this
time
she
added
you
shall
not
have
that
long
tiresome
trip
by
train
there
will
be
room
in
the
car
she
did
not
attempt
to
make
room
for
lemoyne
she
was
glad
to
have
no
need
to
do
so
lemoyne
was
deeply
engrossed
otherwise
annabella
and
her
antics
were
almost
ready
for
the
public
eye
the
first
of
may
would
see
the
performance
and
the
numerous
rehearsals
were
exacting
whether
as
regarded
the
effort
demanded
or
the
time
every
spare
hour
was
going
into
them
as
well
as
many
an
hour
that
could
hardly
be
spared
lemoyne
who
had
been
cast
originally
for
a
minor
female
part
now
found
himself
transferred
through
the
failure
of
a
principal
to
a
more
important
one
for
him
then
rehearsals
were
more
exigent
than
ever
he
cut
his
psychology
once
or
twice
nor
could
he
succeed
during
office
hours
in
keeping
his
mind
on
his
superiors
became
impatient
and
then
protestant
the
annual
spring
dislocation
of
ordered
student
life
was
indeed
a
regular
feature
of
the
year
last
term
yet
to
push
indulgence
as
far
as
arthur
lemoyne
was
pushing
it
cope
was
concerned
then
worried
arthur
he
said
be
reasonable
about
this
you
got
real
work
to
do
remember
but
lemoyne
real
work
was
in
the
musical
comedy
this
is
the
biggest
chance
i
ever
had
in
my
life
he
declared
and
i
do
want
to
lose
out
on
it
so
cope
rolled
away
to
the
dunes
and
left
lemoyne
behind
for
one
saturday
night
rehearsal
the
more
duneland
gave
him
a
tonic
welcome
under
a
breezy
sky
the
far
edge
of
the
lake
stood
out
clear
along
its
nearer
edge
the
vivacious
waves
tumbled
noisily
the
steady
pines
were
welcoming
the
fresh
early
foliage
of
such
companions
as
dressed
and
undressed
in
accord
with
the
calendar
the
wrecked
trunks
which
had
given
up
life
and
its
leafy
pomps
seemed
somehow
less
sombre
and
stark
and
in
the
threatened
woodlands
behind
the
hills
a
multiplicity
of
small
new
greeneries
stirred
the
autumn
dead
leaves
and
brightened
up
the
thickets
of
shrubbery
the
arbutus
had
companioned
the
hepatica
and
the
squads
of
the
lupines
were
busily
preparing
their
panoply
of
racemes
nature
was
breaking
bounds
on
the
inland
horizon
rose
the
vast
bulk
of
the
prison
as
on
other
excursions
nobody
tried
too
hard
to
see
it
it
all
too
lovely
exclaimed
medora
phillips
and
what
is
quite
as
good
she
was
able
to
declare
the
house
itself
is
all
right
winter
had
not
weakened
its
roof
nor
wrenched
away
its
no
irresponsible
wayfarer
had
used
it
for
a
lodging
nor
had
any
casual
marauder
entered
to
despoil
medora
directed
the
disposition
of
the
hamper
of
food
with
a
relieved
air
and
sent
cope
down
with
peter
for
an
armful
or
two
of
driftwood
from
the
assertive
shore
and
you
carolyn
she
said
see
if
the
will
really
go
down
on
the
beach
itself
where
the
past
winter
waste
was
still
profusely
spread
cope
rose
to
the
greening
hills
to
the
fresh
sweep
of
the
wind
and
to
the
green
and
purple
streakings
over
the
water
the
wind
in
particular
took
its
own
way
dry
light
sand
blown
from
higher
shelvings
striped
the
dark
wet
edges
of
the
shore
and
every
bending
blade
of
sandgrass
drew
a
circle
about
itself
with
its
own
revolving
tip
cope
let
the
robust
and
willing
peter
pick
up
most
of
the
firewood
and
himself
luxuriated
in
the
spacious
world
round
about
him
yes
a
winter
had
flown
or
at
any
rate
had
passed
and
here
he
was
again
there
had
been
annoyances
but
now
he
felt
a
wide
and
liberal
relief
here
for
example
was
the
special
stretch
of
shore
on
which
amy
leffingwell
had
praised
his
singing
and
had
hinted
her
desire
to
accompany
him
but
never
mind
that
farther
on
was
the
particular
tract
where
hortense
dunton
had
pottered
with
her
and
had
harried
him
with
the
heroines
of
eighteenth
century
fiction
but
never
mind
that
either
all
those
things
were
past
and
he
was
free
nobody
remained
save
carolyn
thorpe
an
unaggressive
girl
with
whom
one
could
really
trust
oneself
and
with
whom
one
could
walk
if
required
in
comfort
and
content
cope
threw
up
his
head
to
the
hills
and
threw
out
his
chest
to
the
winds
and
laid
quick
hands
on
a
short
length
of
hemlock
plank
afraid
i
not
holding
up
my
end
he
said
to
peter
at
the
house
again
he
found
that
carolyn
had
brought
the
back
into
service
and
with
helga
had
cast
the
cloth
over
the
table
and
had
set
some
necessary
dishes
on
it
he
fetched
a
pail
or
two
of
water
from
the
pump
and
each
time
placed
a
fresh
young
sassafras
leaf
on
the
surface
the
of
our
he
said
facetiously
to
show
that
our
products
are
pure
and
carolyn
despite
his
facetiousness
felt
more
than
ever
that
he
might
easily
become
a
poet
medora
viewed
the
floating
leaves
with
indulgent
appreciation
but
do
let
cumber
ourselves
with
many
cares
she
suggested
we
are
here
to
make
the
best
of
the
afternoon
let
out
and
away
the
sooner
the
better
the
three
soon
set
forth
for
a
stroll
through
spring
reviving
domain
cope
walked
between
medora
and
carolyn
or
ahead
of
them
impartially
sweeping
away
twigs
and
flowering
branches
from
before
their
faces
the
young
junipers
were
putting
forth
tender
new
tips
the
bright
leaves
of
the
sassafras
shone
forth
against
the
pines
above
the
tops
of
the
oaks
and
maples
in
the
valley
below
them
the
three
witches
rose
gauntly
and
off
on
their
far
hill
the
two
companion
pines
how
had
he
named
them
romeo
and
juliet
pelleas
and
melisande
still
lay
their
dark
heads
together
in
mysterious
confidences
under
the
heightening
glow
of
the
late
afternoon
sun
carolyn
looked
from
them
back
to
cope
and
gave
him
a
shy
smile
he
did
not
quite
smile
back
carolyn
was
well
enough
however
she
was
suitably
dressed
for
a
walk
her
shoes
were
sensible
and
so
was
her
hair
amy
had
run
to
fluffiness
hortense
had
often
favored
heavy
waves
and
emphatic
bandeaux
but
carolyn
hair
was
drawn
back
plainly
from
her
forehead
and
was
gathered
in
a
small
knot
still
no
concern
of
mine
he
reminded
himself
and
walked
on
ahead
carolyn
sensible
shoes
brought
her
back
with
the
others
at
twilight
the
three
took
up
rather
ornamentally
with
aid
from
peter
and
helga
the
lighter
details
of
housekeeping
toward
the
end
of
the
stroll
cope
and
carolyn
perhaps
upon
the
mere
unconscious
basis
of
youth
had
rather
fallen
in
together
and
medora
phillips
once
or
twice
had
had
to
safeguard
for
herself
her
face
and
eyesight
from
the
young
trees
that
bordered
their
path
but
that
evening
as
they
sat
on
a
settle
before
the
driftwood
fire
medora
took
pains
to
place
herself
in
the
middle
carolyn
was
a
sweet
young
flower
doubtless
humbler
possibly
than
amy
or
hortense
yet
she
too
perhaps
must
be
extirpated
gently
but
firmly
from
the
garden
of
desire
you
look
better
already
medora
said
to
cope
you
go
back
a
new
man
her
elbow
was
on
the
back
of
the
settle
and
close
to
his
shoulder
his
face
caught
the
glow
from
the
fire
oh
i
all
right
i
assure
you
he
said
you
look
better
observed
carolyn
on
her
own
account
this
air
is
everything
only
a
few
hours
of
it
another
bit
of
wood
on
the
fire
if
you
please
carolyn
said
her
patroness
let
me
do
it
said
cope
he
rose
quickly
and
laid
on
a
stick
or
two
he
remained
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
glow
he
hoped
nobody
would
say
again
that
he
was
looking
rather
thin
and
pale
and
what
is
lemoyne
doing
this
evening
presently
asked
phillips
in
a
dreamy
undertone
her
manner
was
casual
and
negligent
her
voice
was
low
and
leisurely
she
seemed
to
place
lemoyne
at
a
distance
of
many
many
leagues
rehearsing
i
suppose
yes
replied
cope
this
new
play
has
absorbed
him
completely
he
will
do
well
he
always
does
he
always
has
men
in
girls
parts
are
so
amusing
said
carolyn
their
walk
is
so
heavy
and
clumsy
even
if
their
dancing
is
and
when
they
speak
up
in
those
big
deep
bass
and
baritone
voices
arthur
will
speak
in
a
light
tenor
will
his
walk
be
heavy
and
clumsy
asked
phillips
he
is
an
artist
replied
cope
not
too
much
of
one
i
trust
she
returned
i
confess
i
like
boys
best
in
such
parts
when
they
frankly
and
honestly
seem
to
be
boys
that
half
the
fun
and
of
the
taste
taste
yes
taste
short
for
good
taste
there
a
great
deal
of
room
for
bad
a
thing
may
be
done
too
thoroughly
once
or
twice
i
seen
it
done
that
way
by
artists
cope
in
the
seemed
rather
unhappy
he
finds
time
for
for
all
this
this
technique
phillips
asked
he
very
clever
replied
cope
rather
unhappy
still
it
does
take
time
of
course
i
concerned
he
added
about
his
other
work
yes
he
stepped
aside
a
little
into
the
shadow
come
back
to
your
place
said
medora
phillips
you
look
quite
spectral
cope
with
a
light
sigh
returned
to
his
post
on
the
settle
and
to
his
share
in
the
firelight
silence
fell
from
far
below
were
heard
the
active
waves
moaning
themselves
to
rest
and
a
featureless
evening
moved
on
slowly
as
a
at
ten
cope
found
himself
tucked
away
in
a
small
room
on
the
ground
floor
it
had
been
left
quite
as
planned
and
constructed
by
the
original
builder
of
the
house
it
was
cramped
and
narrow
with
low
ceiling
and
one
small
window
it
gave
on
a
short
which
was
almost
too
narrow
to
sit
on
and
which
was
apropos
of
no
special
prospect
doubtless
more
than
one
stalwart
youth
had
slept
there
before
him
a
succession
of
farmers
sons
who
fed
all
day
on
the
airs
and
spaces
of
the
great
and
who
needed
little
of
either
through
a
short
night
rest
it
was
more
comfortable
at
the
end
of
april
than
other
guests
had
found
it
in
a
little
before
eleven
he
awoke
the
house
with
a
loud
ringing
cry
some
one
outside
had
passed
his
narrow
window
feet
were
heard
on
the
back
porch
and
hands
at
the
kitchen
door
peter
was
out
as
quickly
as
cope
himself
and
the
women
in
differing
stages
of
dress
and
followed
at
once
while
phillips
and
carolyn
were
clinging
to
cope
who
had
rushed
out
in
undershirt
and
trousers
peter
had
a
short
tussle
on
the
porch
with
the
intruder
he
came
in
showing
a
scratch
or
two
on
his
face
and
he
reported
the
pantry
window
broken
open
some
tramp
along
the
beach
saw
our
lights
suggested
carolyn
what
was
he
like
peter
asked
phillips
i
could
make
out
in
the
dark
peter
replied
but
he
fought
hard
for
what
he
took
and
he
got
away
with
it
he
felt
the
marks
on
his
face
must
have
been
a
pretty
hungry
man
it
was
some
refugee
hiding
in
my
woods
said
medora
phillips
she
made
her
real
thought
no
plainer
she
never
liked
to
see
in
her
walks
that
distant
prison
and
she
never
spoke
of
it
to
her
guests
but
the
fancy
of
some
escaped
convict
lurking
below
among
her
thickets
was
often
present
in
her
mind
her
fancy
was
now
busy
with
some
burglar
or
even
some
murderer
who
had
made
his
bolt
for
liberty
and
she
clung
informally
to
the
cope
as
to
a
savior
she
saw
with
displeasure
that
carolyn
was
disposed
to
cling
too
she
asked
carolyn
to
control
herself
and
told
her
the
danger
was
over
she
even
requested
her
to
return
to
her
room
but
carolyn
lingered
medora
herself
stood
with
cope
in
the
light
of
the
dying
fire
she
was
dressed
almost
as
inadequately
as
he
but
she
felt
that
she
must
cling
tremblingly
to
him
and
thank
him
for
something
or
other
i
do
know
what
you
saved
us
from
she
panted
we
may
owe
our
very
lives
to
you
peter
in
the
background
again
thoughtfully
felt
his
face
and
became
conscious
of
a
growing
ache
in
the
muscles
of
his
arms
he
retired
with
a
smile
to
a
still
more
distant
plane
the
regular
did
the
work
and
the
volunteer
got
the
praise
phillips
presently
gave
up
her
drooping
hold
on
the
reluctant
cope
and
called
peter
forward
is
anything
missing
she
asked
only
part
of
the
breakfast
i
expect
said
peter
with
a
grin
and
maybe
some
of
the
lunch
he
surely
was
a
hungry
man
well
we
starve
see
to
all
the
doors
and
windows
before
you
go
back
to
bed
but
going
back
to
bed
was
the
one
thing
that
she
herself
felt
unable
to
do
she
asked
carolyn
to
bring
her
a
wrap
of
some
kind
or
other
and
sat
down
on
the
settle
to
talk
it
over
cope
had
modestly
slipped
on
a
coat
the
fire
was
dying
that
was
the
only
difference
between
twelve
and
ten
if
i
had
known
what
was
going
to
happen
declared
medora
volubly
i
never
could
have
gone
to
bed
at
all
and
to
think
here
she
left
carolyn
end
of
the
settle
and
drew
nearer
to
cope
that
i
should
ever
have
even
thought
of
coming
out
here
without
a
man
she
now
rated
her
midnight
intruder
as
a
murderer
and
believed
more
devoutly
than
ever
that
cope
had
saved
all
their
lives
cope
who
knew
that
he
had
contributed
nothing
but
a
loud
pair
of
lungs
began
to
feel
rather
foolish
nor
did
the
anomalous
situation
commend
itself
in
any
degree
to
his
taste
but
it
hit
medora
phillips
taste
precisely
and
she
continued
to
sit
there
pressing
an
emotional
enjoyment
from
it
an
hour
passed
before
her
excitement
an
excitement
kept
up
perhaps
rather
factitiously
was
calmed
and
she
trusted
herself
back
in
her
own
room
breakfast
was
a
scanty
affair
it
must
be
that
if
anything
was
to
be
left
over
for
lunch
while
they
were
busy
with
toast
and
coffee
voices
were
heard
in
the
woods
loud
cries
in
call
and
answer
there
said
medora
setting
down
her
cup
i
knew
it
presently
two
men
came
climbing
up
to
the
house
while
the
voices
of
others
were
still
audible
in
the
humpy
thickets
below
the
men
were
part
of
a
of
course
a
posse
and
they
wanted
to
know
whether
he
tried
to
break
in
said
medora
phillips
eagerly
but
this
gentleman
she
turned
appreciatively
to
cope
carolyn
really
impressed
by
her
seriousness
and
ardor
almost
began
to
believe
that
they
owed
their
lives
to
bertram
cope
alone
was
he
a
murderer
asked
medora
the
men
looked
serious
but
made
no
categorical
reply
they
glanced
at
the
wrecked
pantry
window
and
they
looked
with
more
intentness
at
the
long
sliding
footprints
which
led
away
down
the
then
they
slid
down
themselves
medora
asked
carolyn
to
do
what
she
could
toward
constructing
a
lunch
and
then
walked
down
to
the
shore
with
cope
to
compose
her
nerves
no
stroll
today
along
the
ridged
amphitheatre
of
the
hills
whence
the
long
low
range
of
buildings
under
that
tall
chimney
was
so
plainly
in
view
still
less
relishing
the
idea
of
a
tramp
through
the
woods
themselves
the
certain
haunt
somewhere
of
some
skulking
desperado
no
they
would
take
the
shore
itself
open
to
the
wide
firmament
clear
of
all
snares
and
free
from
every
disconcerting
sight
poor
carolyn
said
medora
presently
how
fluttered
and
inefficient
she
was
a
good
secretary
in
a
routine
way
but
so
lacking
in
initiative
and
cope
look
tended
to
become
a
stare
he
thought
that
carolyn
had
been
in
pretty
fair
control
of
herself
had
been
less
fluttery
and
excited
indeed
than
her
employer
but
medora
had
been
piqued
the
night
before
by
carolyn
tendency
to
linger
on
the
scene
and
to
help
skim
the
emotional
cream
from
the
situation
and
in
such
dishabille
too
i
hope
you
do
think
she
seemed
immodest
but
cope
had
given
small
heed
to
their
dress
or
to
their
lack
of
it
in
fact
he
had
noticed
little
if
any
difference
between
them
he
only
knew
that
he
had
felt
a
degree
more
comfortable
after
getting
his
own
coat
on
carolyn
understands
her
place
pretty
well
mused
medora
yet
anybody
might
be
excused
for
looking
anyhow
at
such
a
time
observed
cope
fending
off
the
intrusion
of
a
new
set
of
considerations
and
in
such
a
sudden
stir
i
hope
nobody
noticed
how
i
looked
well
you
were
noticeable
declared
medora
with
some
archness
she
had
been
conscious
enough
of
his
spare
waist
his
sinewy
arms
his
swelling
chest
it
was
easy
enough
to
see
where
the
noise
came
from
she
said
looking
him
over
yes
i
supplied
the
noise
and
that
only
it
was
peter
please
remember
who
supplied
the
muscle
she
declined
to
let
her
mind
dwell
on
peter
peter
possessed
no
charm
besides
he
was
prosaically
on
the
payroll
they
continued
to
saunter
along
the
sand
yesterday
sparse
clouds
had
vanished
along
with
much
of
yesterday
wind
the
waters
that
had
tumbled
and
vociferated
now
merely
murmured
the
lake
stood
calmly
blue
and
the
new
green
was
thickening
on
the
hills
confident
birds
flitted
busily
among
the
trees
and
shrubs
spring
was
disclosed
in
its
most
alluring
mood
suddenly
three
or
four
figures
appeared
on
the
beach
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
they
had
descended
through
one
of
the
sandy
and
ravaged
channelings
which
broke
at
intervals
the
regulated
rim
of
the
hills
and
they
came
on
toward
our
two
strollers
medora
closed
her
eyes
to
peer
at
them
are
they
marching
a
prisoner
she
asked
they
all
appear
to
be
walking
free
are
they
carrying
knapsacks
khaki
puttees
and
knapsacks
i
think
some
university
men
said
they
might
happen
along
if
they
really
have
knapsacks
and
anything
to
eat
in
them
they
welcome
otherwise
we
had
better
hide
quick
and
hope
they
lose
the
place
and
pass
us
by
one
of
the
advancing
figures
lifted
a
semaphoric
arm
too
late
said
cope
they
recognize
you
then
we
walk
on
and
meet
them
declared
medora
the
were
young
professors
and
graduate
students
they
were
soon
in
possession
of
the
thrilling
facts
of
the
past
night
and
one
of
them
offered
to
be
a
prisoner
if
a
prisoner
was
desired
when
they
heard
how
bertram
cope
had
saved
the
lives
of
defenseless
women
in
a
lonely
land
they
inclined
to
smile
two
of
them
had
been
present
on
another
shore
when
cope
had
saved
amy
leffingwell
from
a
watery
death
and
they
knew
how
far
heroics
might
be
pushed
by
women
who
were
willing
to
idealize
cope
saw
their
smiles
and
felt
that
he
had
fumbled
an
opportunity
when
he
might
have
been
a
truncheon
he
had
been
only
a
megaphone
the
new
arrivals
after
climbing
the
sandy
rise
to
the
house
were
shown
the
devastated
kitchen
and
were
asked
to
declare
what
provisions
they
carried
they
had
enough
food
for
their
own
needs
and
a
trifle
to
spare
lunch
might
be
managed
but
any
thought
of
a
later
meal
was
out
of
the
question
we
start
back
at
said
medora
to
peter
meanwhile
to
the
college
men
the
world
is
ours
after
lunch
the
enlarged
party
walked
forth
again
phillips
had
old
things
to
show
to
fresh
eyes
she
formed
the
new
visitors
into
a
compact
little
group
and
let
them
see
how
good
a
guide
she
could
be
cope
and
carolyn
strolled
negligently
even
unsystematically
behind
once
or
twice
the
personally
conducted
looked
back
i
hope
she
wo
tell
them
again
how
i
came
to
the
rescue
said
cope
it
makes
a
man
feel
too
flat
for
words
anybody
might
think
to
hear
her
go
on
that
i
had
saved
you
all
from
robbery
and
murder
why
but
did
you
inquired
carolyn
seriously
gets
new
light
on
his
cope
had
the
luck
to
get
back
to
churchton
with
little
further
in
the
way
of
homage
he
was
careful
with
carolyn
she
had
perhaps
addressed
him
in
a
sonnet
and
she
might
go
on
and
address
him
in
an
ode
he
thought
he
had
done
nothing
to
deserve
the
one
and
he
would
do
almost
anything
to
escape
the
other
she
was
a
nice
pleasant
quiet
girl
but
nice
pleasant
quiet
girls
were
beginning
to
do
such
equivocal
things
in
poetical
print
having
returned
to
town
by
a
method
that
put
the
minimum
tax
on
his
powers
cope
was
in
shape
next
day
for
an
hour
on
the
faculty
he
played
with
no
special
skill
or
vigor
but
he
made
a
pleasing
picture
in
his
flannels
and
carolyn
who
happened
to
pass
who
passed
by
at
about
five
in
the
afternoon
lingered
for
the
spectacle
and
thought
of
two
or
three
lines
to
start
a
poem
with
cope
unconscious
of
this
presently
turned
his
attention
to
lemoyne
who
was
on
the
eve
of
his
first
dress
rehearsal
and
who
was
a
good
deal
occupied
with
wigs
and
lingerie
here
one
detail
leads
to
another
and
anyone
who
goes
in
wholeheartedly
may
go
in
dreadfully
deep
their
room
came
to
be
strown
with
all
the
disconcerting
items
of
a
theatrical
wardrobe
cope
soon
reached
the
point
where
he
was
not
quite
sure
that
he
liked
it
all
and
he
began
to
develop
a
distaste
for
preoccupation
with
it
he
came
home
one
afternoon
to
find
on
the
corner
of
his
desk
a
long
pair
of
silk
stockings
and
a
too
dainty
pair
of
ladies
shoes
oh
art
he
protested
and
then
not
speaking
his
essential
thought
are
these
pretty
expensive
the
thing
has
got
to
be
done
right
returned
lemoyne
feet
are
about
the
first
thing
they
notice
at
the
actual
performance
lemoyne
feet
were
noticed
certainly
though
perhaps
not
more
than
his
head
his
wig
as
is
usually
the
case
with
dark
people
was
of
a
sunny
blond
hue
its
curls
as
palpably
artificial
as
they
were
voluminous
made
his
eyes
look
darker
and
somehow
more
liquid
than
ever
the
contrast
was
piquant
almost
sensational
of
course
he
had
sacrificed
for
the
time
his
small
moustache
lemoyne
was
not
annabella
herself
but
only
her
chief
chum
yet
shorter
skirts
and
shorter
sleeves
and
a
deliberately
assumed
feminine
air
helped
distinguish
him
from
the
hearty
young
lads
who
manoeuvred
in
the
chorus
just
who
are
those
who
enjoy
the
epicene
on
the
stage
not
many
women
one
prefers
to
think
and
surely
it
arouses
the
impatience
if
not
worse
of
many
men
most
amateur
drama
is
based
perhaps
on
the
attempted
escape
one
likes
to
bolt
from
his
own
day
his
own
usual
costume
his
own
range
of
ideas
and
even
from
his
own
sex
endeavors
toward
this
last
are
most
enjoyable
or
least
offensive
when
they
show
frank
and
patent
inadequacy
it
was
arthur
lemoyne
fortune
or
misfortune
to
do
his
work
all
too
well
phillips
found
his
performance
as
little
to
her
taste
as
she
had
anticipated
carolyn
thorpe
got
as
much
enjoyment
out
of
the
gauche
carriage
and
rough
voices
of
the
chorus
girls
as
she
had
expected
but
was
not
observed
to
warm
toward
annabella
closest
friend
the
pearsons
back
from
their
wedding
trip
had
seats
near
the
big
crimson
velvet
curtain
pearson
himself
openly
luxuriated
in
the
amusing
ineptitude
of
two
or
three
beskirted
acquaintances
among
the
upper
classmen
but
frowned
at
lemoyne
light
tenor
tones
and
mincing
ways
of
course
the
right
sort
of
fellow
even
if
he
had
to
sing
his
solo
in
the
lightest
of
light
tenors
would
still
on
lapsing
into
dialogue
reinstate
himself
apologetically
by
using
as
rough
and
gruff
a
voice
as
he
could
summon
not
so
lemoyne
he
was
doing
a
consistent
piece
of
characterization
and
he
was
feminine
even
overfeminine
throughout
i
never
liked
him
anyway
said
george
to
amy
amy
gave
a
nod
of
agreement
yet
why
this
critical
zeal
there
was
but
one
man
to
like
after
all
that
that
gown
said
george
in
further
condemnation
there
such
a
thing
as
going
too
far
basil
randolph
met
cope
in
the
back
lobby
at
the
close
of
the
performance
the
dramatic
season
in
the
city
itself
had
begun
to
languish
besides
that
randolph
in
order
to
maintain
his
place
on
the
edge
of
the
life
academical
always
made
it
a
point
to
remember
the
grayfriars
each
spring
a
very
thorough
consistent
piece
of
work
your
friend
said
randolph
he
spoke
in
a
firm
net
withholding
tone
looking
cope
full
in
the
face
meanwhile
what
he
said
was
little
perhaps
of
what
was
in
his
mind
yet
cope
caught
a
note
of
criticism
and
of
condemnation
yes
he
almost
felt
constrained
to
say
in
reply
yes
i
know
what
you
did
for
him
for
me
rather
and
possibly
this
is
not
the
outcome
foreseen
i
hope
you
wo
regret
your
aid
randolph
went
past
him
placidly
he
seemed
to
have
little
to
regret
on
the
contrary
he
almost
appeared
to
be
pleased
he
may
have
felt
that
lemoyne
had
shown
himself
in
a
tolerably
clear
light
and
that
it
was
for
cope
should
he
choose
to
take
heed
two
days
later
randolph
gave
his
impression
of
the
performance
to
foster
it
just
what
i
should
have
expected
declared
the
cripple
acrimoniously
i
glad
you
never
had
any
taste
for
the
fellow
and
i
should
have
been
quite
as
well
pleased
if
i
had
found
you
caring
for
the
other
randolph
took
refuge
in
a
bland
inexpressiveness
there
was
no
need
to
school
his
face
he
had
only
to
discipline
his
voice
oh
well
he
said
smoothly
it
only
a
passing
something
soon
to
be
over
perhaps
he
used
an
alien
word
because
he
could
not
select
on
the
instant
from
his
stock
of
english
the
word
he
needed
and
because
he
was
not
quite
sure
what
idea
he
wanted
to
express
i
only
wish
he
went
on
in
the
same
even
tone
that
this
chap
had
been
doing
better
by
his
work
at
one
early
stage
of
the
rehearsals
there
was
a
lot
of
registration
and
for
the
new
term
well
if
he
has
been
satisfactory
they
need
blame
me
let
them
blame
the
system
that
diverts
so
much
time
and
attention
to
interests
quite
outside
the
regular
curriculum
you
talk
like
a
book
said
foster
with
blunt
disdain
language
began
was
made
to
conceal
thought
completed
the
other
stop
talking
stop
thinking
or
if
you
must
think
just
get
your
thoughts
back
on
your
business
foster
might
have
expressed
himself
still
more
pungently
if
he
had
been
aware
as
cope
was
of
an
episode
which
took
place
behind
the
scenes
at
the
close
of
the
performance
lemoyne
singing
and
dancing
in
the
last
act
had
had
a
marked
success
after
all
people
had
come
to
enjoy
and
to
applaud
following
two
or
three
recalls
a
large
sheaf
of
roses
had
been
passed
over
the
footlights
for
a
close
imitation
of
professional
procedure
was
held
to
give
the
advantage
of
strict
vraisemblance
this
tribute
lemoyne
took
in
character
with
certain
graces
pirouettes
and
smiles
his
success
so
mounted
to
his
head
for
he
was
the
one
person
in
the
case
who
approximated
a
professional
effect
that
after
he
had
retired
he
could
not
quiet
down
and
leave
his
part
he
continued
to
act
and
in
his
general
state
of
ebulliency
he
endeavored
to
bestow
a
measure
of
upwelling
femininity
upon
another
performer
who
was
in
the
dress
of
his
own
sex
this
downright
fellow
in
cutaway
and
silk
hat
did
not
understand
or
at
least
had
no
patience
with
a
rôle
carried
too
far
he
brusquely
cleared
himself
of
lemoyne
arm
with
a
good
vigorous
push
this
effort
not
only
propelled
lemoyne
against
some
scenery
and
left
him
despite
the
voluminous
blond
wig
with
a
bruise
on
his
forehead
it
immediately
pushed
him
out
of
his
part
and
it
ended
by
pushing
him
out
of
the
organization
and
even
out
of
the
university
keep
off
will
you
said
the
young
crudely
lemoyne
atmosphere
dissipated
suddenly
his
collapsed
as
he
looked
about
he
saw
plainly
that
the
other
man
act
was
approved
he
had
carried
things
too
far
well
such
are
the
risks
run
by
the
sincere
artist
when
all
this
reached
cope
he
felt
a
personal
chagrin
truly
the
art
of
human
intercourse
was
an
art
that
called
for
some
care
slight
wound
left
no
trace
after
hours
perhaps
his
notices
in
the
index
and
the
campus
had
acted
as
a
salve
but
certain
sections
of
opinion
remained
unfriendly
and
there
was
arising
a
new
atmosphere
of
distaste
and
disapproval
the
college
authorities
had
not
been
satisfied
for
some
time
with
his
clerical
labors
and
some
of
them
thought
that
his
stage
performance
an
exhibition
one
of
them
termed
it
called
for
reproof
or
more
they
laid
their
heads
together
and
lemoyne
and
cope
were
not
long
in
learning
their
decision
lemoyne
was
pronounced
a
useless
element
in
one
field
a
discrepant
element
in
another
a
detriment
in
both
his
essentially
slight
connection
with
the
real
life
of
the
university
came
to
be
more
fully
recognized
alma
mater
in
fine
could
do
without
him
and
meant
to
censure
was
the
lot
of
the
indignant
boys
who
officered
the
society
and
who
asked
lemoyne
to
withdraw
and
complete
scission
from
the
nourishing
vine
of
knowledge
was
his
final
fate
no
occupation
no
source
of
income
winnebago
was
cold
nor
was
it
to
be
warmed
into
ardor
by
it
had
seen
too
many
already
and
was
tired
of
them
the
two
young
men
conferred
again
basil
randolph
was
their
hope
he
ought
to
be
able
to
do
something
for
me
in
the
city
said
lemoyne
he
acquainted
in
business
circles
is
he
cope
bent
over
him
paler
thinner
more
solicitous
i
try
it
he
said
cope
once
more
approached
randolph
but
randolph
shook
his
head
he
had
no
faith
in
lemoyne
and
he
had
done
enough
already
against
his
own
interests
and
desires
lemoyne
fluttered
about
to
little
effect
for
a
few
weeks
while
cope
was
finishing
up
his
thesis
beyond
an
accustomed
and
desired
companionship
lemoyne
contributed
nothing
was
a
drag
in
truth
he
returned
to
winnebago
a
fortnight
before
the
convocation
and
the
conferring
of
degrees
and
it
was
the
understanding
that
somehow
he
and
cope
should
share
together
a
summer
divided
between
winnebago
and
freeford
randolph
was
left
to
claim
cope
interest
if
he
could
takes
his
lemoyne
departure
but
a
fortnight
before
cope
small
share
in
the
convocation
seemed
to
hint
at
mutual
dissatisfaction
it
might
even
stand
for
a
disagreement
or
possibly
a
quarrel
it
just
as
well
that
he
went
said
randolph
to
himself
his
presence
here
was
no
advantage
to
bertram
nor
to
anybody
else
and
with
another
fortnight
cope
himself
would
be
gone
and
who
knew
in
what
distant
quarter
he
might
take
up
his
autumn
work
his
ambitions
as
randolph
knew
pointed
to
some
important
university
in
the
east
meanwhile
make
the
most
of
the
flying
days
medora
phillips
took
the
same
view
she
let
carolyn
thorpe
loose
for
a
week
spring
vacation
and
sent
cope
word
that
she
was
alone
in
a
darkened
depopulated
home
amy
married
hortense
banished
carolyn
waved
aside
with
all
such
varying
devotions
removed
why
should
he
not
look
in
on
her
loneliness
during
these
final
days
for
dinner
or
tea
he
was
still
charming
however
difficult
however
recalcitrant
and
he
was
soon
to
depart
and
who
could
believe
that
the
fall
term
would
bring
his
equal
or
his
like
randolph
still
taking
his
business
easily
had
suggestions
for
walks
and
lunches
he
had
also
free
time
to
make
his
suggestions
operative
but
cope
though
frequently
seen
in
active
movement
on
the
campus
and
through
the
town
gave
little
heed
to
either
of
his
elderly
friends
he
met
them
both
in
high
street
on
different
occasions
and
thanked
and
smiled
and
promised
and
kept
away
he
was
doubtless
absorbed
in
his
special
work
in
the
details
of
the
closing
year
he
may
have
thought
as
young
men
have
been
known
to
think
that
in
accepting
their
invitations
he
had
done
enough
for
them
already
he
had
shown
his
good
will
on
several
occasions
let
that
suffice
or
he
may
have
thought
as
young
men
have
been
found
capable
of
thinking
not
at
all
other
concerns
more
pressing
and
more
contemporaneous
may
have
crowded
them
out
of
his
mind
altogether
i
wonder
if
it
sensitiveness
asked
randolph
of
foster
his
chum
did
go
away
in
the
best
of
good
odor
settle
it
for
yourself
returned
foster
brusquely
and
recall
that
you
have
an
office
and
might
have
still
if
you
insist
on
asking
me
i
do
but
you
may
speak
if
you
like
and
if
you
will
consent
to
be
fobbed
off
with
a
answer
that
right
do
say
all
you
think
then
i
would
put
it
somewhere
between
indifference
and
ingratitude
nearer
the
latter
we
know
the
young
i
do
feel
that
i
done
so
very
much
for
him
said
randolph
rather
colorlessly
you
were
inclined
to
h
yes
i
could
have
opened
up
avenues
that
would
have
made
his
year
here
a
very
different
thing
perhaps
he
did
realize
what
i
could
do
and
perhaps
he
found
me
too
old
shall
you
attend
the
convocation
i
go
usually
i
push
him
off
from
shore
and
waft
him
good
riddance
you
never
liked
him
i
never
did
if
he
leaves
town
without
showing
up
here
no
loss
medora
expects
him
here
i
think
so
randolph
descended
to
the
lower
floor
phillips
was
alone
seated
behind
a
that
steamed
with
expectation
going
she
asked
going
joe
is
grouchy
and
violent
today
and
he
keeps
on
reminding
me
that
i
have
an
office
medora
glanced
at
the
clock
expectation
seemed
to
be
simmering
down
stay
a
few
moments
if
you
like
forget
the
office
a
little
longer
i
make
some
fresh
not
all
these
preparations
for
me
well
they
here
take
advantage
you
all
alone
alone
the
house
is
empty
medora
tried
to
look
as
if
at
the
heart
of
a
tremendous
vacuum
i
ca
fill
it
you
can
fill
fifteen
minutes
oh
if
you
going
to
confound
time
and
space
he
sat
down
receptively
medora
rang
a
bell
and
harried
helga
a
little
she
glanced
at
randolph
he
sat
there
as
if
less
to
fill
than
to
be
filled
say
something
she
said
are
you
going
to
the
convocation
no
he
sat
silent
does
that
exhaust
the
subjects
of
interest
she
asked
pretty
nearly
does
it
medora
fell
silent
in
turn
let
the
light
clatter
of
the
tea
things
speak
for
her
are
you
going
to
the
convocation
he
presently
asked
again
such
variety
she
mocked
are
you
she
hesitated
yes
she
said
that
better
let
go
together
as
friends
who
would
imagine
us
going
as
enemies
who
indeed
yet
if
they
went
together
they
went
as
reconciled
competitors
they
went
as
the
result
of
a
truce
i
should
like
to
see
bertram
cope
in
cap
and
gown
he
said
he
has
worn
them
before
he
tells
me
as
a
as
a
member
of
the
choir
during
his
undergraduate
days
i
see
i
never
noticed
him
especially
then
she
acknowledged
we
can
notice
him
now
medora
made
a
slight
grimace
yes
we
can
notice
he
the
actor
they
the
audience
a
farewell
performance
a
final
view
convocation
day
came
clear
fair
mild
the
professors
walked
in
colorful
solemnity
beneath
the
elms
and
up
the
middle
aisle
of
the
chapel
lending
both
to
outdoors
and
indoors
the
enlivenment
of
hoods
red
yellow
purple
the
marshals
led
strings
of
candidates
long
strings
and
short
to
the
platform
where
the
president
sat
and
the
deans
presented
in
due
order
their
bachelors
masters
and
doctors
the
rapid
handing
out
of
the
diplomas
brought
frequent
applause
bits
spatters
volleys
as
the
case
might
be
there
was
recognition
for
a
chinaman
for
a
negro
for
a
pair
of
filipinos
there
was
a
marked
outburst
for
a
husky
young
man
who
was
assumed
by
the
uninformed
to
have
been
a
star
in
the
university
athletic
life
there
was
a
respectful
but
emphatic
acknowledgment
for
a
woman
with
gray
hair
who
was
led
on
with
four
men
as
a
little
string
of
five
there
was
a
salvo
for
a
thoughtful
dignified
man
of
who
went
up
as
a
group
in
himself
attended
by
marshals
before
and
behind
and
there
was
a
slight
spatter
of
applause
for
bertram
cope
one
of
a
small
procession
of
six
yet
rather
more
for
a
smiling
young
man
who
followed
him
cope
looked
somewhat
spare
despite
his
voluminous
gown
the
trying
lights
added
little
color
to
his
face
and
brought
his
into
undue
prominence
but
he
took
his
sheepskin
with
a
bow
and
a
gesture
that
extinguished
several
of
his
companions
and
he
faced
the
audience
on
descending
from
the
stage
with
a
composed
effect
gained
by
experience
in
the
choir
the
lustre
in
the
ceiling
lit
up
his
yellow
hair
and
his
blue
eyes
he
is
as
charming
as
ever
thought
medora
phillips
he
had
a
hard
pull
of
it
commented
randolph
i
hope
his
own
people
will
feed
him
up
this
summer
said
medora
her
emphasis
was
wayward
he
would
let
we
do
it
she
seemed
to
mean
nor
me
she
almost
made
randolph
say
there
was
a
recessional
and
then
the
crowds
of
students
flooded
the
corridors
and
circulated
under
the
fresh
foliage
of
the
campus
randolph
and
medora
phillips
passed
out
with
the
rest
of
the
assemblage
in
the
midst
of
one
of
the
avenues
of
elms
they
noticed
cope
as
the
center
of
a
little
group
two
plain
elderly
people
his
parents
doubtless
and
and
medora
phillips
looked
twice
yes
the
other
figure
was
carolyn
thorpe
offering
congratulations
carolyn
had
returned
to
her
post
and
her
work
the
day
before
h
thought
medora
disposed
to
be
miffed
still
carolyn
had
after
all
the
same
right
to
attend
as
anyone
else
medora
and
basil
randolph
added
their
congratulations
to
carolyn
cope
still
in
academic
garb
performed
the
necessary
introductions
his
air
was
eager
but
cursory
smiling
and
ready
yet
impersonal
and
cool
above
all
expeditious
if
his
parents
passed
on
with
the
impression
that
medora
phillips
and
basil
randolph
were
but
casual
acquaintances
worthy
of
nothing
beyond
brief
formalities
the
blame
was
his
own
i
showing
father
and
mother
over
the
campus
he
said
with
an
open
smile
and
a
wave
with
his
diploma
as
he
edged
away
the
elders
docilely
took
their
cue
and
moved
away
with
him
well
said
randolph
there
buildings
of
course
and
fountains
and
and
memorial
benches
but
they
add
nothing
to
him
pronounced
medora
as
she
looked
back
on
the
retiring
party
did
you
expect
them
to
he
asked
charm
like
guilt
is
personal
anyhow
there
seems
to
be
no
brother
he
added
well
come
carolyn
said
medora
to
her
returned
secretary
who
was
looking
after
the
party
too
let
start
for
home
good
afternoon
basil
what
nice
good
pleasant
friendly
people
they
are
breathed
carolyn
randolph
had
strolled
away
and
medora
phillips
turned
a
studious
glance
on
her
companion
carolyn
was
conceivably
in
a
state
of
mind
keyed
up
to
an
appreciation
did
that
foreshadow
further
verse
a
rustic
rhapsody
a
provincial
pantoum
but
medora
withheld
question
much
as
she
would
have
enjoyed
a
impression
of
the
visitors
she
did
not
intend
to
secure
it
by
interrogating
carolyn
thorpe
in
a
final
cope
after
a
few
days
followed
his
parents
back
to
freeford
he
may
have
said
to
his
landlady
and
to
some
of
his
associates
in
his
department
but
he
contrived
no
set
adieux
for
the
friends
who
had
done
so
much
for
him
or
had
tried
to
through
the
past
year
basil
randolph
and
medora
phillips
had
their
last
view
of
him
when
diploma
in
hand
he
led
his
parents
away
over
the
campus
oh
well
said
randolph
resignedly
we
were
less
important
to
him
than
we
thought
only
a
couple
of
negligible
items
among
many
entered
in
his
ledger
if
we
entered
and
now
faded
away
to
a
dim
rusty
illegible
scrawl
stop
it
basil
you
make
me
feel
old
antique
antediluvian
i
want
to
i
sha
let
myself
be
pushed
back
and
ignored
i
going
to
give
amy
and
george
a
rousing
big
dinner
before
long
and
when
the
fall
term
opens
i
shall
entertain
as
never
before
and
if
that
young
man
from
the
south
turns
up
here
during
the
summer
to
see
hortense
i
shall
do
a
lot
for
them
hortense
dunton
had
long
since
returned
of
course
from
the
tennessee
and
north
carolina
mountains
but
she
ignored
the
convocation
one
drop
of
bitterness
if
tasted
again
even
reminiscently
would
have
turned
everything
to
gall
instead
she
found
a
measure
of
sweetness
in
the
letters
which
followed
on
her
return
from
that
region
they
were
addressed
in
a
bold
dashing
young
hand
and
bore
the
postmark
nashville
hortense
was
inclined
to
let
them
lie
conspicuously
on
the
table
for
half
an
hour
or
so
before
she
took
them
up
little
might
be
absolutely
known
about
her
passage
with
cope
but
there
the
letters
lay
for
her
aunt
eye
and
for
carolyn
thorpe
carolyn
prattled
a
little
not
indiscreetly
about
her
meeting
with
the
freeford
family
on
the
campus
as
basil
randolph
himself
had
done
months
before
she
endeavored
to
construct
a
general
environment
for
them
and
to
determine
their
place
in
the
general
social
fabric
she
had
however
the
advantage
of
having
seen
them
she
was
not
called
to
make
an
exiguous
evocation
from
the
void
she
still
held
that
they
were
nice
good
pleasant
friendly
people
if
they
had
subordinated
themselves
docilely
and
automatically
to
the
prepotent
social
and
academic
figures
of
the
society
about
them
that
in
no
wise
detracted
from
the
favorable
impression
they
had
made
on
her
just
the
right
parents
for
bertram
she
said
fondly
to
herself
she
made
almost
unconsciously
the
allowance
that
is
still
generally
made
among
americans
for
the
difference
between
two
generations
the
elder
of
course
continues
to
provide
a
staid
sober
and
somewhat
primitive
background
for
the
brilliancy
of
the
younger
her
own
people
if
they
appeared
in
churchton
might
seem
a
bit
simple
and
provincial
too
hortense
took
carolyn
slight
and
fond
observations
with
a
silent
scorn
when
she
spoke
at
all
she
was
likely
to
say
something
about
family
and
it
was
gathered
that
the
dashing
correspondent
at
nashville
was
conspicuously
also
that
he
belonged
to
the
stirring
new
south
and
had
put
money
in
his
purse
contempt
for
the
and
impecunious
cope
became
boundless
about
the
middle
of
july
a
letter
lay
on
the
table
for
carolyn
it
was
from
cope
only
think
said
carolyn
to
herself
in
a
small
private
ecstasy
within
her
locked
bedchamber
he
wrote
on
his
own
account
and
of
his
own
accord
not
a
line
from
me
not
a
suggestion
the
letter
was
an
affair
of
two
small
pages
yours
very
sincerely
bertram
cope
simply
told
my
dear
miss
thorpe
that
he
had
been
spending
three
or
four
days
in
winnebago
wisconsin
and
that
he
had
now
returned
home
for
a
month
of
further
study
having
obtained
a
post
in
an
important
university
in
the
east
at
a
satisfactory
stipend
a
supplementary
line
conveyed
regards
to
phillips
and
that
was
all
was
it
a
handful
of
husks
or
was
it
a
banquet
carolyn
took
it
for
the
latter
and
lived
on
it
for
days
little
it
mattered
what
or
how
much
he
had
written
he
had
written
and
of
his
own
accord
as
carolyn
made
a
point
of
from
the
first
there
is
an
algebraic
formula
expressive
of
the
truth
that
is
an
infinitely
greater
number
of
times
than
and
a
single
small
taper
is
infinitely
greater
in
point
of
light
and
cheer
than
none
at
all
carolyn
little
world
underwent
illumination
and
she
with
it
she
promptly
soared
to
a
shining
infinity
medora
phillips
could
not
overlook
carolyn
general
glow
nor
the
sense
of
elevation
she
conveyed
things
became
clearer
still
when
carolyn
passed
on
the
scanty
message
which
cope
had
added
at
the
end
best
regards
to
phillips
there
it
was
so
far
as
it
went
and
medora
felt
along
with
carolyn
that
a
slight
mention
was
an
immensity
of
times
greater
than
no
mention
at
all
very
kind
very
thoughtful
of
him
i
sure
she
said
without
irony
carolyn
let
her
read
the
letter
for
herself
it
was
a
brief
cool
succinct
thing
and
not
at
all
unsuited
for
general
circulation
best
regards
to
phillips
yours
very
sincerely
bertram
cope
she
read
again
then
like
carolyn
she
retired
for
meditation
well
from
its
dozen
or
fifteen
lines
several
things
might
fairly
be
inferred
three
or
four
days
in
winnebago
a
scanty
pattern
for
a
visit
had
three
or
four
been
enough
had
lemoyne
been
found
glum
and
unpleasant
had
those
months
of
close
companionship
brought
about
a
mutually
diminished
interest
not
a
word
as
to
lemoyne
accompanying
him
to
freeford
or
joining
him
there
later
on
the
contrary
a
strong
implication
that
there
would
be
sufficient
to
occupy
him
without
the
company
of
lemoyne
or
anybody
else
evidences
of
an
eye
set
solely
on
the
new
opportunity
in
the
east
well
if
he
is
going
to
get
along
without
him
said
medora
to
herself
it
will
be
all
the
better
for
him
he
was
never
any
advantage
to
him
she
added
with
an
informal
and
irresponsible
use
of
her
pronouns
but
she
knew
what
she
meant
and
had
no
auditor
to
satisfy
when
however
she
touched
on
the
matter
with
basil
randolph
she
showed
more
exactitude
randolph
had
lingered
late
upstairs
with
foster
and
he
had
been
intercepted
on
his
way
out
with
an
invitation
to
remain
to
dinner
very
well
he
said
is
not
invariably
inspired
on
monday
evening
i
shall
be
glad
to
stay
he
felt
in
fact
the
need
of
a
little
soothing
foster
had
been
taking
a
farewell
shot
at
cope
and
had
been
rough
and
vindictive
he
had
heard
something
of
the
antics
of
annabella
partner
and
had
magnified
characteristically
the
seriousness
of
the
offense
what
hope
for
him
meaning
cope
so
long
as
he
goes
on
liking
and
admiring
that
fellow
well
returned
randolph
in
an
effortless
platitude
liking
is
the
great
mystery
whether
you
take
its
coming
or
its
going
the
sooner
this
one
goes
the
better
snapped
foster
have
you
heard
from
that
fellow
at
all
he
inquired
fellow
what
fellow
this
time
the
other
one
of
course
cope
no
foster
wiped
out
cope
with
one
question
likely
to
some
other
young
chap
next
year
randolph
had
a
moment
of
sober
thoughtfulness
no
good
get
back
into
harness
have
and
all
the
rest
of
it
best
thing
in
the
world
for
you
the
young
care
so
much
for
us
the
devil
they
do
foster
gave
a
savage
dragging
clutch
at
his
shade
and
twisted
rebelliously
in
his
chair
randolph
left
him
to
himself
and
went
below
downstairs
dinner
proceeded
cautiously
there
was
no
chance
for
an
interchange
of
thought
until
the
two
young
women
should
have
been
got
out
of
the
way
hortense
had
her
own
affair
at
the
back
of
her
head
and
carolyn
hers
neither
could
sympathize
with
the
other
manner
to
carolyn
was
one
of
insolence
carolyn
buoyed
up
interiorly
seemed
able
to
endure
it
perhaps
was
not
fully
conscious
of
it
there
was
relief
when
after
dessert
each
arose
and
went
her
respective
way
medora
and
randolph
settled
down
on
a
causeuse
in
the
the
place
was
but
randolph
made
out
that
his
companion
was
taking
on
a
conscious
air
of
her
eyes
roved
the
dim
cluttered
room
with
studied
mournfulness
and
she
said
presently
dear
old
house
undergoing
depopulation
and
soon
to
be
a
waste
depopulation
yes
they
leaving
it
one
by
one
first
amy
you
remember
amy
i
believe
so
she
married
george
and
went
away
you
recall
the
occasion
i
think
i
was
present
and
now
it
hortense
is
it
indeed
she
told
him
about
the
gallant
young
southerner
in
tennessee
and
gave
a
forecast
of
a
probable
pairing
and
next
it
will
be
carolyn
carolyn
who
has
cast
his
eye
on
her
medora
shot
it
out
bertram
cope
cope
randolph
gave
himself
another
twist
in
that
sofa
cope
she
repeated
if
the
boy
were
indeed
beyond
her
own
reach
she
would
report
his
imminent
capture
by
another
with
as
much
effect
as
she
could
command
and
she
told
of
carolyn
fateful
letter
so
that
how
it
stands
he
said
thoughtfully
i
do
say
it
stands
i
do
say
that
it
at
all
but
he
has
prospects
and
she
has
hopes
prospects
and
hopes
a
strong
working
combination
medora
took
the
leap
she
will
marry
him
of
course
she
said
decidedly
after
his
having
jilted
amy
her
do
you
understand
it
that
way
and
trampled
on
hortense
surely
you
exaggerate
and
ignored
me
you
will
let
me
use
that
mild
word
its
use
is
granted
he
has
ignored
others
too
after
all
that
who
is
there
left
in
the
house
but
carolyn
listen
i
tell
you
how
it
will
be
she
has
answered
his
letter
of
course
imagine
whether
or
not
she
was
prompt
about
it
and
he
will
answer
hers
answer
it
not
at
once
perhaps
but
soon
in
the
course
of
two
or
three
weeks
then
she
will
reply
and
there
you
have
a
correspondence
in
full
swing
then
in
the
fall
he
will
write
her
from
his
new
post
in
the
east
and
say
girl
at
last
i
can
and
so
on
you
mean
that
you
destine
poor
carolyn
for
a
man
who
is
so
apt
at
jilting
and
trampling
and
ignoring
who
else
is
there
medora
continued
to
demand
sturdily
in
october
they
will
be
married
heaven
forbid
ejaculated
randolph
you
have
something
better
to
suggest
nothing
better
something
different
listen
as
you
yourself
say
next
october
i
shall
call
on
you
put
my
hand
in
my
inside
pocket
bring
out
a
letter
and
read
it
to
you
it
will
run
like
this
dear
randolph
you
will
be
pleased
i
am
sure
to
hear
that
i
now
have
a
good
position
at
the
university
in
this
pleasant
town
arthur
lemoyne
whom
you
recall
is
studying
psychology
here
and
we
are
keeping
house
together
he
wishes
to
be
remembered
i
thank
you
for
your
many
kindnesses
that
is
put
in
as
a
mere
possibility
also
send
best
regards
to
phillips
and
the
members
of
her
household
sincerely
yours
bertram
l
cope
i
wo
accept
that
cried
medora
he
will
marry
carolyn
and
i
shall
do
as
much
for
her
as
i
did
for
amy
and
as
much
as
i
expect
to
do
for
hortense
i
see
the
three
matches
made
and
the
desolation
of
the
house
complete
complete
yes
leaving
me
alone
among
the
ruins
and
nothing
would
rescue
you
from
them
but
a
fourth
basil
you
are
not
proposing
i
scarcely
think
so
he
returned
with
slow
candor
i
should
care
to
live
in
this
house
and
you
i
knew
you
never
liked
my
furnishings
and
you
i
am
sure
would
never
care
to
live
in
any
other
i
shall
stay
where
i
am
she
declared
shall
you
stay
where
you
are
she
asked
keenly
perhaps
not
confess
that
housekeeping
on
your
own
account
is
less
attractive
than
it
once
was
i
do
confess
that
you
with
all
your
outfit
and
all
your
never
quite
never
quite
succeeded
in
medora
shrugged
the
young
at
best
only
tolerate
us
we
are
but
the
platform
they
dance
on
the
ladder
they
climb
by
after
all
he
was
a
chap
your
own
word
you
know
yet
scarcely
worth
the
we
made
over
him
said
medora
willing
to
save
her
face
randolph
shrugged
in
turn
and
threw
out
his
hands
in
a
gesture
which
she
had
never
known
him
to
employ
before
worth
the
who
is
