i
a
gentleman
of
the
range
when
madeline
hammond
stepped
from
the
train
at
el
cajon
new
mexico
it
was
nearly
midnight
and
her
first
impression
was
of
a
huge
dark
space
of
cool
windy
emptiness
strange
and
silent
stretching
away
under
great
blinking
white
stars
miss
there
no
one
to
meet
you
said
the
conductor
rather
anxiously
i
wired
my
brother
she
replied
the
train
being
so
late
perhaps
he
grew
tired
of
waiting
he
will
be
here
presently
but
if
he
should
not
come
surely
i
can
find
a
hotel
there
lodgings
to
be
had
get
the
station
agent
to
show
you
if
you
excuse
me
this
is
no
place
for
a
lady
like
you
to
be
alone
at
night
it
a
rough
little
town
mostly
mexicans
miners
cowboys
and
they
carouse
a
lot
besides
the
revolution
across
the
border
has
stirred
up
some
excitement
along
the
line
miss
i
guess
it
safe
enough
if
you
thank
you
i
am
not
in
the
least
as
the
train
started
to
glide
away
miss
hammond
walked
towards
the
dimly
lighted
station
as
she
was
about
to
enter
she
encountered
a
mexican
with
sombrero
hiding
his
features
and
a
blanket
mantling
his
shoulders
is
there
any
one
here
to
meet
miss
hammond
she
asked
no
sabe
senora
he
replied
from
under
the
muffling
blanket
and
he
shuffled
away
into
the
shadow
she
entered
the
empty
an
gave
out
a
thick
yellow
light
the
ticket
window
was
open
and
through
it
she
saw
there
was
neither
agent
nor
operator
in
the
little
compartment
a
telegraph
instrument
clicked
faintly
madeline
hammond
stood
tapping
a
shapely
foot
on
the
floor
and
with
some
amusement
contrasted
her
reception
in
el
cajon
with
what
it
was
when
she
left
a
train
at
the
grand
central
the
only
time
she
could
remember
ever
having
been
alone
like
this
was
once
when
she
had
missed
her
maid
and
her
train
at
a
place
outside
of
versailles
an
adventure
that
had
been
a
novel
and
delightful
break
in
the
prescribed
routine
of
her
life
she
crossed
the
to
a
window
and
holding
aside
her
veil
looked
out
at
first
she
could
descry
only
a
few
dim
lights
and
these
blurred
in
her
sight
as
her
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
darkness
she
saw
a
superbly
built
horse
standing
near
the
window
beyond
was
a
bare
square
or
if
it
was
a
street
it
was
the
widest
one
madeline
had
ever
seen
the
dim
lights
shone
from
low
flat
buildings
she
made
out
the
dark
shapes
of
many
horses
all
standing
motionless
with
drooping
heads
through
a
hole
in
the
came
a
cool
breeze
and
on
it
breathed
a
sound
that
struck
coarsely
upon
her
ear
a
discordant
mingling
of
laughter
and
shout
and
the
tramp
of
boots
to
the
hard
music
of
a
phonograph
western
revelry
mused
miss
hammond
as
she
left
the
window
now
what
to
do
i
wait
here
perhaps
the
station
agent
will
return
soon
or
alfred
will
come
for
as
she
sat
down
to
wait
she
reviewed
the
causes
which
accounted
for
the
remarkable
situation
in
which
she
found
herself
that
madeline
hammond
should
be
alone
at
a
late
hour
in
a
dingy
little
western
railroad
station
was
indeed
extraordinary
the
close
of
her
debutante
year
had
been
marred
by
the
only
unhappy
experience
of
her
life
the
disgrace
of
her
brother
and
his
leaving
home
she
dated
the
beginning
of
a
certain
thoughtful
habit
of
mind
from
that
time
and
a
dissatisfaction
with
the
brilliant
life
society
offered
her
the
change
had
been
so
gradual
that
it
was
permanent
before
she
realized
it
for
a
while
an
active
outdoor
life
golf
tennis
yachting
kept
this
realization
from
becoming
morbid
introspection
there
came
a
time
when
even
these
lost
charm
for
her
and
then
she
believed
she
was
indeed
ill
in
mind
travel
did
not
help
her
there
had
been
months
of
unrest
of
curiously
painful
wonderment
that
her
position
her
wealth
her
popularity
no
longer
sufficed
she
believed
she
had
lived
through
the
dreams
and
fancies
of
a
girl
to
become
a
woman
of
the
world
and
she
had
gone
on
as
before
a
part
of
the
glittering
show
but
no
longer
blind
to
the
truth
that
there
was
nothing
in
her
luxurious
life
to
make
it
significant
sometimes
from
the
depths
of
her
there
flashed
up
at
odd
moments
intimations
of
a
future
revolt
she
remembered
one
evening
at
the
opera
when
the
curtain
had
risen
upon
a
particularly
piece
of
stage
scenery
a
broad
space
of
deep
desolateness
reaching
away
under
an
infinitude
of
night
sky
illumined
by
stars
the
suggestion
it
brought
of
vast
wastes
of
lonely
rugged
earth
of
a
great
vault
of
starry
sky
pervaded
her
soul
with
a
strange
sweet
peace
when
the
scene
was
changed
she
lost
this
vague
new
sense
of
peace
and
she
turned
away
from
the
stage
in
irritation
she
looked
at
the
long
curved
tier
of
glittering
boxes
that
represented
her
world
it
was
a
distinguished
and
splendid
world
the
wealth
fashion
culture
beauty
and
blood
of
a
nation
she
madeline
hammond
was
a
part
of
it
she
smiled
she
listened
she
talked
to
the
men
who
from
time
to
time
strolled
into
the
hammond
box
and
she
felt
that
there
was
not
a
moment
when
she
was
natural
true
to
herself
she
wondered
why
these
people
could
not
somehow
some
way
be
different
but
she
could
not
tell
what
she
wanted
them
to
be
if
they
had
been
different
they
would
not
have
fitted
the
place
indeed
they
would
not
have
been
there
at
all
yet
she
thought
wistfully
that
they
lacked
something
for
her
and
suddenly
realizing
she
would
marry
one
of
these
men
if
she
did
not
revolt
she
had
been
assailed
by
a
great
weariness
an
sense
that
life
had
palled
upon
her
she
was
tired
of
fashionable
society
she
was
tired
of
polished
imperturbable
men
who
sought
only
to
please
her
she
was
tired
of
being
feted
admired
loved
followed
and
importuned
tired
of
people
tired
of
houses
noise
ostentation
luxury
she
was
so
tired
of
herself
in
the
lonely
distances
and
the
passionless
stars
of
boldly
painted
stage
scenery
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
that
stirred
her
soul
the
feeling
did
not
last
she
could
not
call
it
back
she
imagined
that
the
very
boldness
of
the
scene
had
appealed
to
her
she
divined
that
the
man
who
painted
it
had
found
inspiration
joy
strength
serenity
in
rugged
nature
and
at
last
she
knew
what
she
needed
to
be
alone
to
brood
for
long
hours
to
gaze
out
on
lonely
silent
darkening
stretches
to
watch
the
stars
to
face
her
soul
to
find
her
real
self
then
it
was
she
had
first
thought
of
visiting
the
brother
who
had
gone
west
to
cast
his
fortune
with
the
cattlemen
as
it
happened
she
had
friends
who
were
on
the
eve
of
starting
for
california
and
she
made
a
quick
decision
to
travel
with
them
when
she
calmly
announced
her
intention
of
going
out
west
her
mother
had
exclaimed
in
consternation
and
her
father
surprised
into
pathetic
memory
of
the
black
sheep
of
the
family
had
stared
at
her
with
glistening
eyes
why
madeline
you
want
to
see
that
wild
boy
then
he
had
reverted
to
the
anger
he
still
felt
for
his
wayward
son
and
he
had
forbidden
madeline
to
go
her
mother
forgot
her
haughty
poise
and
dignity
madeline
however
had
exhibited
a
will
she
had
never
before
been
known
to
possess
she
stood
her
ground
even
to
reminding
them
that
she
was
and
her
own
mistress
in
the
end
she
had
prevailed
and
that
without
betraying
the
real
state
of
her
mind
her
decision
to
visit
her
brother
had
been
too
hurriedly
made
and
acted
upon
for
her
to
write
him
about
it
and
so
she
had
telegraphed
him
from
new
york
and
also
a
day
later
from
chicago
where
her
traveling
friends
had
been
delayed
by
illness
nothing
could
have
turned
her
back
then
madeline
had
planned
to
arrive
in
el
cajon
on
october
her
brother
birthday
and
she
had
succeeded
though
her
arrival
occurred
at
the
hour
her
train
had
been
several
hours
late
whether
or
not
the
message
had
reached
alfred
hands
she
had
no
means
of
telling
and
the
thing
which
concerned
her
now
was
the
fact
that
she
had
arrived
and
he
was
not
there
to
meet
her
it
did
not
take
long
for
thought
of
the
past
to
give
way
wholly
to
the
reality
of
the
present
i
hope
nothing
has
happened
to
alfred
she
said
to
herself
he
was
well
doing
splendidly
the
last
time
he
wrote
to
be
sure
that
was
a
good
while
ago
but
then
he
never
wrote
often
he
all
right
pretty
soon
he
come
and
how
glad
i
be
i
wonder
if
he
has
as
madeline
sat
waiting
in
the
yellow
gloom
she
heard
the
faint
intermittent
click
of
the
telegraph
instrument
the
low
hum
of
wires
the
occasional
stamp
of
an
hoof
and
a
distant
vacant
laugh
rising
above
the
sounds
of
the
dance
these
commonplace
things
were
new
to
her
she
became
conscious
of
a
slight
quickening
of
her
pulse
madeline
had
only
a
limited
knowledge
of
the
west
like
all
of
her
class
she
had
traveled
europe
and
had
neglected
america
a
few
letters
from
her
brother
had
confused
her
already
vague
ideas
of
plains
and
mountains
as
well
as
of
cowboys
and
cattle
she
had
been
astounded
at
the
interminable
distance
she
had
traveled
and
if
there
had
been
anything
attractive
to
look
at
in
all
that
journey
she
had
passed
it
in
the
night
and
here
she
sat
in
a
dingy
little
station
with
telegraph
wires
moaning
a
lonely
song
in
the
wind
a
faint
sound
like
the
rattling
of
thin
chains
diverted
attention
at
first
she
imagined
it
was
made
by
the
telegraph
wires
then
she
heard
a
step
the
door
swung
wide
a
tall
man
entered
and
with
him
came
the
clinking
rattle
she
realized
then
that
the
sound
came
from
his
spurs
the
man
was
a
cowboy
and
his
entrance
recalled
vividly
to
her
that
of
dustin
farnum
in
the
first
act
of
the
will
you
please
direct
me
to
a
hotel
asked
madeline
rising
the
cowboy
removed
his
sombrero
and
the
sweep
he
made
with
it
and
the
accompanying
bow
despite
their
exaggeration
had
a
kind
of
rude
grace
he
took
two
long
strides
toward
her
lady
are
you
married
in
the
past
miss
hammond
sense
of
humor
had
often
helped
her
to
overlook
critical
exactions
natural
to
her
breeding
she
kept
silence
and
she
imagined
it
was
just
as
well
that
her
veil
hid
her
face
at
the
moment
she
had
been
prepared
to
find
cowboys
rather
striking
and
she
had
been
warned
not
to
laugh
at
them
this
gentleman
of
the
range
deliberately
reached
down
and
took
up
her
left
hand
before
she
recovered
from
her
start
of
amaze
he
had
stripped
off
her
glove
fine
spark
but
no
he
drawled
lady
i
glad
to
see
you
not
he
released
her
hand
and
returned
the
glove
you
see
the
only
in
this
here
town
is
against
boarding
married
indeed
said
madeline
trying
to
adjust
her
wits
to
the
situation
it
sure
is
he
went
on
bad
business
for
to
have
married
women
keeps
the
boys
away
you
see
this
is
then
he
laughed
rather
boyishly
and
from
that
and
the
way
he
slouched
on
his
sombrero
madeline
realized
he
was
half
drunk
as
she
instinctively
recoiled
she
not
only
gave
him
a
keener
glance
but
stepped
into
a
position
where
a
better
light
shone
on
his
face
it
was
like
red
bronze
bold
raw
sharp
he
laughed
again
as
if
amused
with
himself
and
the
laugh
scarcely
changed
the
hard
set
of
his
features
like
that
of
all
women
whose
beauty
and
charm
had
brought
them
much
before
the
world
miss
hammond
intuition
had
been
developed
until
she
had
a
delicate
and
exquisitely
sensitive
perception
of
the
nature
of
men
and
of
her
effect
upon
them
this
crude
cowboy
under
the
influence
of
drink
had
affronted
her
nevertheless
whatever
was
in
his
mind
he
meant
no
insult
i
shall
be
greatly
obliged
if
you
will
show
me
to
the
hotel
she
said
lady
you
wait
here
he
replied
slowly
as
if
his
thought
did
not
come
swiftly
i
go
fetch
the
she
thanked
him
and
as
he
went
out
closing
the
door
she
sat
down
in
considerable
relief
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
should
have
mentioned
her
brother
name
then
she
fell
to
wondering
what
living
with
such
uncouth
cowboys
had
done
to
alfred
he
had
been
wild
enough
in
college
and
she
doubted
that
any
cowboy
could
have
taught
him
much
she
alone
of
her
family
had
ever
believed
in
any
latent
good
in
alfred
hammond
and
her
faith
had
scarcely
survived
the
two
years
of
silence
waiting
there
she
again
found
herself
listening
to
the
moan
of
the
wind
through
the
wires
the
horse
outside
began
to
pound
with
heavy
hoofs
and
once
he
whinnied
then
madeline
heard
a
rapid
pattering
low
at
first
and
growing
louder
which
presently
she
recognized
as
the
galloping
of
horses
she
went
to
the
window
thinking
hoping
her
brother
had
arrived
but
as
the
clatter
increased
to
a
roar
shadows
sped
by
lean
horses
flying
manes
and
tails
sombreroed
riders
all
strange
and
wild
in
her
sight
recalling
what
the
conductor
had
said
she
was
at
some
pains
to
quell
her
uneasiness
shrouded
the
dim
lights
in
the
windows
then
out
of
the
gloom
two
figures
appeared
one
tall
the
other
slight
the
cowboy
was
returning
with
a
porter
heavy
footsteps
sounded
without
and
lighter
ones
dragging
along
and
then
suddenly
the
door
rasped
open
jarring
the
whole
room
the
cowboy
entered
pulling
a
disheveled
figure
that
of
a
priest
a
padre
whose
mantle
had
manifestly
been
disarranged
by
the
rude
grasp
of
his
captor
plain
it
was
that
the
padre
was
extremely
terrified
madeline
hammond
gazed
in
bewilderment
at
the
little
man
so
pale
and
shaken
and
a
protest
trembled
upon
her
lips
but
it
was
never
uttered
for
this
cowboy
now
appeared
to
be
a
cool
devil
and
stretching
out
a
long
arm
he
grasped
her
and
swung
her
back
to
the
bench
you
stay
there
he
ordered
his
voice
though
neither
brutal
nor
harsh
nor
cruel
had
the
unaccountable
effect
of
making
her
feel
powerless
to
move
no
man
had
ever
before
addressed
her
in
such
a
tone
it
was
the
woman
in
her
that
obeyed
not
the
personality
of
proud
madeline
hammond
the
padre
lifted
his
clasped
hands
as
if
supplicating
for
his
life
and
began
to
speak
hurriedly
in
spanish
madeline
did
not
understand
the
language
the
cowboy
pulled
out
a
huge
gun
and
brandished
it
in
the
priest
face
then
he
lowered
it
apparently
to
point
it
at
the
priest
feet
there
was
a
red
flash
and
then
a
thundering
report
that
stunned
madeline
the
room
filled
with
smoke
and
the
smell
of
powder
madeline
did
not
faint
or
even
shut
her
eyes
but
she
felt
as
if
she
were
fast
in
a
cold
vise
when
she
could
see
distinctly
through
the
smoke
she
experienced
a
sensation
of
immeasurable
relief
that
the
cowboy
had
not
shot
the
padre
but
he
was
still
waving
the
gun
and
now
appeared
to
be
dragging
his
victim
toward
her
what
possibly
could
be
the
drunken
fool
intention
this
must
be
this
surely
was
a
cowboy
trick
she
had
a
vague
swiftly
flashing
recollection
of
alfred
first
letters
descriptive
of
the
extravagant
fun
of
cowboys
then
she
vividly
remembered
a
moving
picture
she
had
seen
cowboys
playing
a
monstrous
joke
on
a
lone
madeline
no
sooner
thought
of
it
than
she
made
certain
her
brother
was
introducing
her
to
a
little
wild
west
amusement
she
could
scarcely
believe
it
yet
it
must
be
true
old
love
of
teasing
her
might
have
extended
even
to
this
outrage
probably
he
stood
just
outside
the
door
or
window
laughing
at
her
embarrassment
anger
checked
her
panic
she
straightened
up
with
what
composure
this
surprise
had
left
her
and
started
for
the
door
but
the
cowboy
barred
her
passage
grasped
her
arms
then
madeline
divined
that
her
brother
could
not
have
any
knowledge
of
this
indignity
it
was
no
trick
it
was
something
that
was
happening
that
was
real
that
threatened
she
knew
not
what
she
tried
to
wrench
free
feeling
hot
all
over
at
being
handled
by
this
drunken
brute
poise
dignity
culture
all
the
acquired
habits
of
character
fled
before
the
instinct
to
fight
she
was
athletic
she
fought
she
struggled
desperately
but
he
forced
her
back
with
hands
of
iron
she
had
never
known
a
man
could
be
so
strong
and
then
it
was
the
man
coolly
smiling
face
the
paralyzing
strangeness
of
his
manner
more
than
his
strength
that
weakened
madeline
until
she
sank
trembling
against
the
bench
what
do
you
mean
she
panted
dearie
ease
up
a
little
on
the
bridle
he
replied
gaily
madeline
thought
she
must
be
dreaming
she
could
not
think
clearly
it
had
all
been
too
swift
too
terrible
for
her
to
grasp
yet
she
not
only
saw
this
man
but
also
felt
his
powerful
presence
and
the
shaking
priest
the
haze
of
blue
smoke
the
smell
of
powder
these
were
not
unreal
then
close
before
her
eyes
burst
another
blinding
red
flash
and
close
at
her
ears
bellowed
another
report
unable
to
stand
madeline
slipped
down
onto
the
bench
her
drifting
faculties
refused
clearly
to
record
what
transpired
during
the
next
few
moments
presently
however
as
her
mind
steadied
somewhat
she
heard
though
as
in
a
dream
the
voice
of
the
padre
hurrying
over
strange
words
it
ceased
and
then
the
voice
stirred
her
lady
say
si
si
say
it
quick
say
it
si
from
sheer
suggestion
a
force
irresistible
at
this
moment
when
her
will
was
clamped
by
panic
she
spoke
the
word
and
now
lady
so
we
can
finish
this
properly
what
your
name
still
obeying
mechanically
she
told
him
he
stared
for
a
while
as
if
the
name
had
awakened
associations
in
a
mind
somewhat
befogged
he
leaned
back
unsteadily
madeline
heard
the
expulsion
of
his
breath
a
kind
of
hard
puff
not
unusual
in
drunken
men
what
name
he
demanded
madeline
hammond
i
am
alfred
hammond
he
put
his
hand
up
and
brushed
at
an
imaginary
something
before
his
eyes
then
he
loomed
over
her
and
that
hand
now
shaking
a
little
reached
out
for
her
veil
before
he
could
touch
it
however
she
swept
it
back
revealing
her
face
you
not
majesty
hammond
how
strange
stranger
than
anything
that
had
ever
happened
to
her
before
was
it
to
hear
that
name
on
the
lips
of
this
cowboy
it
was
a
name
by
which
she
was
familiarly
known
though
only
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
her
had
the
privilege
of
using
it
and
now
it
revived
her
dulled
faculties
and
by
an
effort
she
regained
control
of
herself
you
are
majesty
hammond
he
replied
and
this
time
he
affirmed
wonderingly
rather
than
questioned
madeline
rose
and
faced
him
yes
i
he
slammed
his
gun
back
into
its
holster
well
i
reckon
we
wo
go
on
with
it
with
what
sir
and
why
did
you
force
me
to
say
si
to
this
priest
i
reckon
that
was
a
way
i
took
to
show
him
you
be
willing
to
get
oh
you
you
words
failed
her
this
appeared
to
galvanize
the
cowboy
into
action
he
grasped
the
padre
and
led
him
toward
the
door
cursing
and
threatening
no
doubt
enjoining
secrecy
then
he
pushed
him
across
the
threshold
and
stood
there
breathing
hard
and
wrestling
with
himself
here
wait
wait
a
minute
miss
miss
hammond
he
said
huskily
you
could
fall
into
worse
company
than
mine
though
i
reckon
you
sure
think
not
i
pretty
drunk
but
i
all
right
otherwise
just
wait
a
she
stood
quivering
and
blazing
with
wrath
and
watched
this
savage
fight
his
drunkenness
he
acted
like
a
man
who
had
been
suddenly
shocked
into
a
rational
state
of
mind
and
he
was
now
battling
with
himself
to
hold
on
to
it
madeline
saw
the
dark
damp
hair
lift
from
his
brows
as
he
held
it
up
to
the
cool
wind
above
him
she
saw
the
white
stars
in
the
sky
and
they
seemed
as
unreal
to
her
as
any
other
thing
in
this
strange
night
they
were
cold
brilliant
aloof
distant
and
looking
at
them
she
felt
her
wrath
lessen
and
die
and
leave
her
calm
the
cowboy
turned
and
began
to
talk
you
see
i
was
pretty
drunk
he
labored
there
was
a
fiesta
and
a
wedding
i
do
fool
things
when
i
drunk
i
made
a
fool
bet
i
marry
the
first
girl
who
came
to
town
if
you
had
worn
that
veil
the
fellows
were
joshing
me
and
ed
linton
was
getting
married
and
everybody
always
wants
to
gamble
i
must
have
been
pretty
after
the
one
look
at
her
when
she
had
first
put
aside
her
veil
he
had
not
raised
his
eyes
to
her
face
the
cool
audacity
had
vanished
in
what
was
either
excessive
emotion
or
the
maudlin
condition
peculiar
to
some
men
when
drunk
he
could
not
stand
still
perspiration
collected
in
beads
upon
his
forehead
he
kept
wiping
his
face
with
his
scarf
and
he
breathed
like
a
man
after
violent
exertions
you
see
i
was
pretty
he
began
explanations
are
not
necessary
she
interrupted
i
am
very
tired
distressed
the
hour
is
late
have
you
the
slightest
idea
what
it
means
to
be
a
gentleman
his
bronzed
face
burned
to
a
flaming
crimson
is
my
brother
here
in
town
madeline
went
on
no
he
at
his
but
i
wired
like
as
not

in
his
box
at
the
he

in
town
he
shipping
cattle
for
meanwhile
i
must
go
to
a
hotel
will
you
please
if
he
heard
her
last
words
he
showed
no
evidence
of
it
a
noise
outside
had
attracted
his
attention
madeline
listened
low
voices
of
men
the
softer
liquid
tones
of
a
woman
drifted
in
through
the
open
door
they
spoke
in
spanish
and
the
voices
grew
louder
evidently
the
speakers
were
approaching
the
station
footsteps
crunching
on
gravel
attested
to
this
and
quicker
steps
coming
with
deep
tones
of
men
in
anger
told
of
a
quarrel
then
the
woman
voice
hurried
and
broken
rising
higher
was
eloquent
of
vain
appeal
the
cowboy
demeanor
startled
madeline
into
anticipation
of
something
dreadful
she
was
not
deceived
from
outside
came
the
sound
of
a
scuffle
a
muffled
shot
a
groan
the
thud
of
a
falling
body
a
low
cry
and
footsteps
padding
away
in
rapid
retreat
madeline
hammond
leaned
weakly
back
in
her
seat
cold
and
sick
and
for
a
moment
her
ears
throbbed
to
the
tramp
of
the
dancers
across
the
way
and
the
rhythm
of
the
cheap
music
then
into
the
open
flashed
a
girl
tragic
face
lighted
by
dark
eyes
and
framed
by
dusky
hair
the
girl
reached
a
slim
brown
hand
round
the
side
of
the
door
and
held
on
as
if
to
support
herself
a
long
black
scarf
accentuated
her
gaudy
attire
senor
gene
she
exclaimed
and
breathless
glad
recognition
made
a
sudden
break
in
her
terror
bonita
the
cowboy
leaped
to
her
girl

took
hold
of

promise

away
from
el
si
he
led
her
outside
madeline
heard
the
horse
snort
and
champ
his
bit
the
cowboy
spoke
low
only
a
few
words
were
intelligible
stirrups
wait
out
of
town
mountain
trail
now
ride
a
moment
silence
ensued
and
was
broken
by
a
pounding
of
hoofs
a
pattering
of
gravel
then
madeline
saw
a
big
dark
horse
run
into
the
wide
space
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
scarf
and
hair
a
little
form
low
down
in
the
saddle
the
horse
was
outlined
in
black
against
the
line
of
dim
lights
there
was
something
wild
and
splendid
in
his
flight
directly
the
cowboy
appeared
again
in
the
doorway
miss
hammond
i
reckon
we
want
to
rustle
out
of
here
been
bad
and
there
a
train
she
hurried
into
the
open
air
not
daring
to
look
back
or
to
either
side
her
guide
strode
swiftly
she
had
almost
to
run
to
keep
up
with
him
many
conflicting
emotions
confused
her
she
had
a
strange
sense
of
this
stalking
giant
beside
her
silent
except
for
his
jangling
spurs
she
had
a
strange
feeling
of
the
cool
sweet
wind
and
the
white
stars
was
it
only
her
disordered
fancy
or
did
these
wonderful
stars
open
and
shut
she
had
a
queer
disembodied
thought
that
somewhere
in
ages
back
in
another
life
she
had
seen
these
stars
the
night
seemed
dark
yet
there
was
a
pale
luminous
light
a
light
from
the
stars
and
she
fancied
it
would
always
haunt
her
suddenly
aware
that
she
had
been
led
beyond
the
line
of
houses
she
spoke
where
are
you
taking
me
to
florence
kingsley
he
replied
who
is
she
i
reckon
she
your
brother
best
friend
out
madeline
kept
pace
with
the
cowboy
for
a
few
moments
longer
and
then
she
stopped
it
was
as
much
from
necessity
to
catch
her
breath
as
it
was
from
recurring
fear
all
at
once
she
realized
what
little
use
her
training
had
been
for
such
an
experience
as
this
the
cowboy
missing
her
came
back
the
few
intervening
steps
then
he
waited
still
silent
looming
beside
her
it
so
dark
so
lonely
she
faltered
how
do
i
know
what
warrant
can
you
give
me
that
you
that
no
harm
will
befall
me
if
i
go
farther
none
miss
hammond
except
that
i
seen
your
ii
a
secret
kept
because
of
that
singular
reply
madeline
found
faith
to
go
farther
with
the
cowboy
but
at
the
moment
she
really
did
not
think
about
what
he
had
said
any
answer
to
her
would
have
served
if
it
had
been
kind
his
silence
had
augmented
her
nervousness
compelling
her
to
voice
her
fear
still
even
if
he
had
not
replied
at
all
she
would
have
gone
on
with
him
she
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
returning
to
the
station
where
she
believed
there
had
been
murder
she
could
hardly
have
forced
herself
to
go
back
to
those
dim
lights
in
the
street
she
did
not
want
to
wander
around
alone
in
the
dark
and
as
she
walked
on
into
the
windy
darkness
much
relieved
that
he
had
answered
as
he
had
reflecting
that
he
had
yet
to
prove
his
words
true
she
began
to
grasp
the
deeper
significance
of
them
there
was
a
revival
of
pride
that
made
her
feel
that
she
ought
to
scorn
to
think
at
all
about
such
a
man
but
madeline
hammond
discovered
that
thought
was
involuntary
that
there
were
feelings
in
her
never
dreamed
of
before
this
night
presently
madeline
guide
turned
off
the
walk
and
rapped
at
a
door
of
a
house
hullo
who
there
a
deep
voice
answered
gene
stewart
said
the
cowboy
call
florence
quick
thump
of
footsteps
followed
a
tap
on
a
door
and
voices
madeline
heard
a
woman
exclaim
gene
here
when
there
a
dance
in
town
something
wrong
out
on
the
a
light
flared
up
and
shone
bright
through
a
window
in
another
moment
there
came
a
patter
of
soft
steps
and
the
door
opened
to
disclose
a
woman
holding
a
lamp
gene
al
not
al
is
all
right
interrupted
the
cowboy
madeline
had
two
sensations
then
one
of
wonder
at
the
note
of
alarm
and
love
in
the
woman
voice
and
the
other
of
unutterable
relief
to
be
safe
with
a
friend
of
her
brother
it
al
sister
came
on
train
the
cowboy
was
saying
i
happened
to
be
at
the
station
and
i
fetched
her
up
to
madeline
came
forward
out
of
the
shadow
not
not
really
majesty
hammond
exclaimed
florence
kingsley
she
nearly
dropped
the
lamp
and
she
looked
and
looked
astounded
beyond
belief
yes
i
am
really
she
replied
madeline
my
train
was
late
and
for
some
reason
alfred
did
not
meet
me
stewart
saw
fit
to
bring
me
to
you
instead
of
taking
me
to
a
oh

so
glad
to
meet
you
replied
florence
warmly
do

in
i
so
surprised
i
forget
my
manners
why
al
never
mentioned
your
he
surely
could
not
have
received
my
messages
said
madeline
as
she
entered
the
cowboy
who
came
in
with
her
satchel
had
to
stoop
to
enter
the
door
and
once
in
he
seemed
to
fill
the
room
florence
set
the
lamp
down
upon
the
table
madeline
saw
a
young
woman
with
a
smiling
friendly
face
and
a
profusion
of
fair
hair
hanging
down
over
her
oh
but
al
will
be
glad
cried
florence
why
you
are
white
as
a
sheet
you
must
be
tired
what
a
long
wait
you
had
at
the
station
i
heard
the
train
come
in
hours
ago
as
i
was
going
to
bed
that
station
is
lonely
at
night
if
i
had
known
you
were
coming
indeed
you
are
very
pale

you
ill
no
only
i
am

tired

i
imagined
i
did
have
rather
a
long
wait
after
arriving
at
the
station
but
i
ca
say
that
it
was
florence
kingsley
searched
madeline
face
with
keen
eyes
and
then
took
a
long
significant
look
at
the
silent
stewart
with
that
she
deliberately
and
quietly
closed
a
door
leading
into
another
room
miss
hammond
what
has
happened
she
had
lowered
her
voice
i
do
not
wish
to
recall
all
that
has
happened
replied
madeline
i
shall
tell
alfred
however
that
i
would
rather
have
met
a
hostile
apache
than
a
please
do
tell

cried
florence
then
she
grasped
stewart
and
pulled
him
close
to
the
light
gene

i
was
pretty
drunk
he
replied
hanging
his
head

and
closed
the
door

florence

first

fiend

same

whatever
he

meant
no
shame
to
you
come
now
do
think
about
it
again
she
took
up
the
lamp
and
led
madeline
into
a
little
room
this
is
out
west
she
went
on
smiling
as
she
indicated
the
few
furnishings
but
you
can
rest
you
perfectly
safe
wo
you
let
me
help
you
undress
ca
i
do
anything
for
you
you
are
very
kind
thank
you
but
i
can
manage
replied
madeline
well
then
good
night
the
sooner
i
go
the
sooner
you
rest
just
forget
what
happened
and
think
how
fine
a
surprise
you
to
give
your
brother
with
that
she
slipped
out
and
softly
shut
the
door
as
madeline
laid
her
watch
on
the
bureau
she
noticed
that
the
time
was
past
two
it
seemed
long
since
she
had
gotten
off
the
train
when
she
had
turned
out
the
lamp
and
crept
wearily
into
bed
she
knew
what
it
was
to
be
utterly
spent
she
was
too
tired
to
move
a
finger
but
her
brain
whirled
she
had
at
first
no
control
over
it
and
a
thousand
thronging
sensations
came
and
went
and
recurred
with
little
logical
relation
there
were
the
roar
of
the
train
the
feeling
of
being
lost
the
sound
of
pounding
hoofs
a
picture
of
her
brother
face
as
she
had
last
seen
it
five
years
before
a
long
dim
line
of
lights
the
jingle
of
silver
spurs
night
wind
darkness
stars
then
the
gloomy
station
the
shadowy
blanketed
mexican
the
empty
room
the
dim
lights
across
the
square
the
tramp
of
the
dancers
and
vacant
laughs
and
discordant
music
the
door
flung
wide
and
the
entrance
of
the
cowboy
she
did
not
recall
how
he
had
looked
or
what
he
had
done
and
the
next
instant
she
saw
him
cool
smiling
devilish
saw
him
in
violence
the
next
his
bigness
his
apparel
his
physical
being
were
vague
as
outlines
in
a
dream
the
white
face
of
the
padre
flashed
along
in
the
train
of
thought
and
it
brought
the
same
dull
indefinable
state
of
mind
subsequent
to
that
last
that
passed
and
then
clear
and
vivid
rose
memories
of
the
rest
that
had
happened
strange
voices
betraying
fury
of
men
a
deadened
report
a
moan
of
mortal
pain
a
poignant
cry
and
madeline
saw
the
girl
great
tragic
eyes
and
the
wild
flight
of
the
big
horse
into
the
blackness
and
the
dark
stalking
figure
of
the
silent
cowboy
and
the
white
stars
that
seemed
to
look
down
remorselessly
this
tide
of
memory
rolled
over
madeline
again
and
again
and
gradually
lost
its
power
and
faded
all
distress
left
her
and
she
felt
herself
drifting
how
black
the
room
was
as
black
with
her
eyes
open
as
it
was
when
they
were
shut
and
the
silence
it
was
like
a
cloak
there
was
absolutely
no
sound
she
was
in
another
world
from
that
which
she
knew
she
thought
of
this
florence
and
of
alfred
and
wondering
about
them
she
dropped
to
sleep
when
she
awakened
the
room
was
bright
with
sunlight
a
cool
wind
blowing
across
the
bed
caused
her
to
put
her
hands
under
the
blanket
she
was
lazily
and
dreamily
contemplating
the
mud
walls
of
this
little
room
when
she
remembered
where
she
was
and
how
she
had
come
there
how
great
a
shock
she
had
been
subjected
to
was
manifest
in
a
sensation
of
disgust
that
overwhelmed
her
she
even
shut
her
eyes
to
try
and
blot
out
the
recollection
she
felt
that
she
had
been
contaminated
presently
madeline
hammond
again
awoke
to
the
fact
she
had
learned
the
preceding
night
that
there
were
emotions
to
which
she
had
heretofore
been
a
stranger
she
did
not
try
to
analyze
them
but
she
exercised
her
to
such
good
purpose
that
by
the
time
she
had
dressed
she
was
outwardly
her
usual
self
she
scarcely
remembered
when
she
had
found
it
necessary
to
control
her
emotions
there
had
been
no
trouble
no
excitement
no
unpleasantness
in
her
life
it
had
been
ordered
for
her
tranquil
luxurious
brilliant
varied
yet
always
the
same
she
was
not
surprised
to
find
the
hour
late
and
was
going
to
make
inquiry
about
her
brother
when
a
voice
arrested
her
she
recognized
miss
kingsley
voice
addressing
some
one
outside
and
it
had
a
sharpness
she
had
not
noted
before
so
you
came
back
did
you
well
you
do
look
very
proud
of
yourself
this
mawnin
gene
stewart
you
look
like
a
say
flo
if
i
am
a
coyote
i
not
going
to
sneak
he
said
what
you
come
for
she
demanded
i
said
i
was
coming
round
to
take
my
meaning
you
not
run
from
al
hammond
gene
your
skull
is
as
thick
as
an
old
cow
al
will
never
know
anything
about
what
you
did
to
his
sister
unless
you
tell
him
and
if
you
do
that
he
shoot
you
she
wo
give
you
away
she
a
thoroughbred
why
she
was
so
white
last
night
i
thought
she
drop
at
my
feet
but
she
never
blinked
an
eyelash
i
a
woman
gene
stewart
and
if
i
could
feel
like
miss
hammond
i
know
how
awful
an
ordeal
she
must
have
had
why
she
one
of
the
most
beautiful
the
most
sought
after
the
most
exclusive
women
in
new
york
city
there
a
crowd
of
millionaires
and
lords
and
dukes
after
her
how
terrible
it
be
for
a
woman
like
her
to
be
kissed
by
a
drunken
cowpuncher
i
say
it
flo
i
never
insulted
her
that
way
broke
out
stewart
it
was
worse
then
she
queried
sharply
i
made
a
bet
that
i
marry
the
first
girl
who
came
to
town
i
was
on
the
watch
and
pretty
drunk
when
she
came
well
i
got
padre
marcos
and
tried
to
bully
her
into
marrying
oh
lord
florence
gasped
it
worse
than
i
feared
gene
al
will
kill
that
be
a
good
thing
replied
the
cowboy
dejectedly
gene
stewart
it
certainly
would
unless
you
turn
over
a
new
leaf
retorted
florence
but
do
be
a
and
here
she
became
earnest
and
appealing
go
away
gene
go
join
the
rebels
across
the
border
you
always
threatening
that
anyhow
do
stay
here
and
run
any
chance
of
stirring
al
up
he
kill
you
just
the
same
as
you
would
kill
another
man
for
insulting
your
sister
do
make
trouble
for
al
that
only
make
sorrow
for
her
the
subtle
import
was
not
lost
upon
madeline
she
was
distressed
because
she
could
not
avoid
hearing
what
was
not
meant
for
her
ears
she
made
an
effort
not
to
listen
and
it
was
futile
flo
you
ca
see
this
a
man
way
he
replied
quietly
i
stay
and
take
my
gene
i
could
sure
swear
at
you
or
any
other
of
a
cowboy
listen
my
jack
heard
something
of
what
i
said
to
you
last
night
he
does
like
you
i
afraid
he
tell
al
for
sake
man
go
and
shut
him
up
and
yourself
then
madeline
heard
her
come
into
the
house
and
presently
rap
on
the
door
and
call
softly
miss
hammond
are
you
awake
awake
and
dressed
miss
kingsley
come
oh
you
rested
you
look
so
so
different
i
sure
glad
come
out
now
we
have
breakfast
and
then
you
may
expect
to
meet
your
brother
any
wait
please
i
heard
you
speaking
to
stewart
it
was
unavoidable
but
i
am
glad
i
must
see
him
will
you
please
ask
him
to
come
into
the
parlor
a
moment
yes
replied
florence
quickly
and
as
she
turned
at
the
door
she
flashed
at
madeline
a
woman
meaning
glance
make
him
keep
his
mouth
shut
presently
there
were
slow
reluctant
steps
outside
the
front
door
then
a
pause
and
the
door
opened
stewart
stood
bareheaded
in
the
sunlight
madeline
remembered
with
a
kind
of
shudder
the
tall
form
the
embroidered
buckskin
vest
the
red
scarf
the
bright
leather
wristbands
the
wide
belt
and
chaps
her
glance
seemed
to
run
over
him
swift
as
lightning
but
as
she
saw
his
face
now
she
did
not
recognize
it
the
man
presence
roused
in
her
a
revolt
yet
something
in
her
the
incomprehensible
side
of
her
nature
thrilled
in
the
look
of
this
splendid
barbarian
mr
stewart
will
you
please
come
in
she
asked
after
that
long
pause
i
reckon
not
he
said
the
hopelessness
of
his
tone
meant
that
he
knew
he
was
not
fit
to
enter
a
room
with
her
and
did
not
care
or
cared
too
much
madeline
went
to
the
door
the
man
face
was
hard
yet
it
was
sad
too
and
it
touched
her
i
shall
not
tell
my
brother
of
your
your
rudeness
to
me
she
began
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
keep
the
chill
out
of
her
voice
to
speak
with
other
than
the
pride
and
aloofness
of
her
class
nevertheless
despite
her
loathing
when
she
had
spoken
so
far
it
seemed
that
kindness
and
pity
followed
involuntarily
i
choose
to
overlook
what
you
did
because
you
were
not
wholly
accountable
and
because
there
must
be
no
trouble
between
alfred
and
you
may
i
rely
on
you
to
keep
silence
and
to
seal
the
lips
of
that
priest
and
you
know
there
was
a
man
killed
or
injured
there
last
night
i
want
to
forget
that
dreadful
thing
i
want
it
known
that
i
heard
the
greaser
did
die
interrupted
stewart
ah
then
that
not
so
bad
after
all
i
am
glad
for
the
sake
of
your
friend
the
little
mexican
a
slow
scarlet
wave
overspread
his
face
and
his
shame
was
painful
to
see
that
fixed
in
madeline
mind
a
conviction
that
if
he
was
a
heathen
he
was
not
wholly
bad
and
it
made
so
much
difference
that
she
smiled
down
at
him
you
will
spare
me
further
distress
will
you
not
please
his
hoarse
reply
was
incoherent
but
she
needed
only
to
see
his
working
face
to
know
his
remorse
and
gratitude
madeline
went
back
to
her
room
and
presently
florence
came
for
her
and
directly
they
were
sitting
at
breakfast
madeline
hammond
impression
of
her
brother
friend
had
to
be
reconstructed
in
the
morning
light
she
felt
a
wholesome
frank
sweet
nature
she
liked
the
slow
southern
drawl
and
she
was
puzzled
to
know
whether
florence
kingsley
was
pretty
or
striking
or
unusual
she
had
a
youthful
glow
and
flush
the
clear
tan
of
outdoors
a
face
that
lacked
the
soft
curves
and
lines
of
eastern
women
and
her
eyes
were
light
gray
like
crystal
steady
almost
piercing
and
her
hair
was
a
beautiful
bright
waving
mass
florence
sister
was
the
elder
of
the
two
a
stout
woman
with
a
strong
face
and
quiet
eyes
it
was
a
simple
fare
and
service
they
gave
to
their
guest
but
they
made
no
apologies
for
that
indeed
madeline
felt
their
simplicity
to
be
restful
she
was
sated
with
respect
sick
of
admiration
tired
of
adulation
and
it
was
good
to
see
that
these
western
women
treated
her
as
very
likely
they
would
have
treated
any
other
visitor
they
were
sweet
kind
and
what
madeline
had
at
first
thought
was
a
lack
of
expression
or
vitality
she
soon
discovered
to
be
the
natural
reserve
of
women
who
did
not
live
superficial
lives
florence
was
breezy
and
frank
her
sister
quaint
and
not
given
much
to
speech
madeline
thought
she
would
like
to
have
these
women
near
her
if
she
were
ill
or
in
trouble
and
she
reproached
herself
for
a
fastidiousness
a
hypercritical
sense
of
refinement
that
could
not
help
distinguishing
what
these
women
lacked
can
you
ride
florence
was
asking
that
what
a
westerner
always
asks
any
one
from
the
east
can
you
ride
like
a
man
astride
i
mean
oh
that
fine
you
look
strong
enough
to
hold
a
horse
we
have
some
fine
horses
out
here
i
reckon
when
al
comes
we
go
out
to
bill
stillwell
ranch
we
have
to
go
whether
we
want
to
or
not
for
when
bill
learns
you
are
here
he
just
pack
us
all
off
you
love
old
bill
his
ranch
is
run
down
but
the
range
and
the
rides
up
in
the
mountains
they
are
beautiful
we
hunt
and
climb
and
most
of
all
we
ride
i
love
a
horse
i
love
the
wind
in
my
face
and
a
wide
stretch
with
the
mountains
beckoning
you
must
have
the
best
horse
on
the
ranges
and
that
means
a
scrap
between
al
and
bill
and
all
the
cowboys
we
do
all
agree
about
horses
except
in
case
of
gene
stewart
does
stewart
own
the
best
horse
in
the
country
asked
madeline
again
she
had
an
inexplicable
thrill
as
she
remembered
the
wild
flight
of
stewart
big
dark
steed
and
rider
yes
and
that
all
he
does
own
replied
florence
gene
ca
keep
even
a
quirt
but
he
sure
loves
that
horse
and
calls
him
at
this
juncture
a
sharp
knock
on
the
parlor
door
interrupted
the
conversation
florence
sister
went
to
open
it
she
returned
presently
and
said
it
gene
he
been
dawdlin
out
there
on
the
front
porch
and
he
knocked
to
let
us
know
miss
hammond
brother
is
florence
hurried
into
the
parlor
followed
by
madeline
the
door
stood
open
and
disclosed
stewart
sitting
on
the
porch
steps
from
down
the
road
came
a
clatter
of
hoofs
madeline
looked
out
over
shoulder
and
saw
a
cloud
of
dust
approaching
and
in
it
she
distinguished
outlines
of
horses
and
riders
a
warmth
spread
over
her
a
little
tingle
of
gladness
and
the
feeling
recalled
her
girlish
love
for
her
brother
what
would
he
be
like
after
long
years
gene
has
jack
kept
his
mouth
shut
queried
florence
and
again
madeline
was
aware
of
a
sharp
ring
in
the
girl
voice
no
replied
stewart
gene
you
wo
let
it
come
to
a
fight
al
can
be
managed
but
jack
hates
you
and
he
have
his
friends
with
there
wo
be
any
use
your
brains
now
added
florence
and
then
she
turned
to
push
madeline
gently
back
into
the
parlor
madeline
glow
of
warmth
changed
to
a
blank
dismay
was
she
to
see
her
brother
act
with
the
violence
she
now
associated
with
cowboys
the
clatter
of
hoofs
stopped
before
the
door
looking
out
madeline
saw
a
bunch
of
dusty
wiry
horses
pawing
the
gravel
and
tossing
lean
heads
her
swift
glance
ran
over
the
lithe
horsemen
trying
to
pick
out
the
one
who
was
her
brother
but
she
could
not
her
glance
however
caught
the
same
rough
dress
and
hard
aspect
that
characterized
the
cowboy
stewart
then
one
rider
threw
his
bridle
leaped
from
the
saddle
and
came
bounding
up
the
porch
steps
florence
met
him
at
the
door
hello
flo
where
is
she
he
called
eagerly
with
that
he
looked
over
her
shoulder
to
espy
madeline
he
actually
jumped
at
her
she
hardly
knew
the
tall
form
and
the
bronzed
face
but
the
warm
flash
of
blue
eyes
was
familiar
as
for
him
he
had
no
doubt
of
his
sister
it
appeared
for
with
broken
welcome
he
threw
his
arms
around
her
then
held
her
off
and
looked
searchingly
at
her
well
sister
he
began
when
florence
turned
hurriedly
from
the
door
and
interrupted
him
al
i
think
you
better
stop
the
wrangling
out
he
stared
at
her
appeared
suddenly
to
hear
the
loud
voices
from
the
street
and
then
releasing
madeline
he
said
by
george
i
forgot
flo
there
is
a
little
business
to
see
to
keep
my
sister
in
here
please
and
do
be
fussed
up
he
went
out
on
the
porch
and
called
to
his
men
shut
off
your
wind
jack
and
you
too
blaze
i
did
want
you
fellows
to
come
here
but
as
you
would
come
you
got
to
shut
up
this
is
my
whereupon
he
turned
to
stewart
who
was
sitting
on
the
fence
hello
stewart
he
said
it
was
a
greeting
but
there
was
that
in
the
voice
which
alarmed
madeline
stewart
leisurely
got
up
and
leisurely
advanced
to
the
porch
hello
hammond
he
drawled
drunk
again
last
night
well
if
you
want
to
know
and
if
it
any
of
your
mix
yes
i
drunk
replied
stewart
it
was
a
kind
of
cool
speech
that
showed
the
cowboy
in
control
of
himself
and
master
of
the
situation
not
an
easy
speech
to
follow
up
with
undue
inquisitiveness
there
was
a
short
silence
damn
it
stewart
said
the
speaker
presently
here
the
situation
it
all
over
town
that
you
met
my
sister
last
night
at
the
station
and
and
insulted
her
jack
got
it
in
for
you
so
have
these
other
boys
but
it
my
affair
understand
i
did
fetch
them
here
they
can
see
you
square
yourself
or
else
gene
you
been
on
the
wrong
trail
for
some
time
drinking
and
all
that
you
going
to
the
bad
but
bill
thinks
and
i
think
you
still
a
man
we
never
knew
you
to
lie
now
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
nobody
is
insinuating
that
i
am
a
liar
drawled
stewart
well
i
glad
to
hear
that
you
see
al
i
was
pretty
drunk
last
night
but
not
drunk
enough
to
forget
the
least
thing
i
did
i
told
pat
hawe
so
this
morning
when
he
was
curious
and
that
polite
for
me
to
be
to
pat
well
i
found
miss
hammond
waiting
alone
at
the
station
she
wore
a
veil
but
i
knew
she
was
a
lady
of
course
i
imagine
now
that
i
think
of
it
that
miss
hammond
found
my
gallantry
rather
startling
and
at
this
point
madeline
answering
to
unconsidered
impulse
eluded
florence
and
walked
out
upon
the
porch
sombreros
flashed
down
and
the
lean
horses
jumped
gentlemen
said
madeline
rather
breathlessly
and
it
did
not
add
to
her
calmness
to
feel
a
hot
flush
in
her
cheeks
i
am
very
new
to
western
ways
but
i
think
you
are
laboring
under
a
mistake
which
in
justice
to
stewart
i
want
to
correct
indeed
he
was
rather
rather
abrupt
and
strange
when
he
came
up
to
me
last
night
but
as
i
understand
him
now
i
can
attribute
that
to
his
gallantry
he
was
somewhat
wild
and
sudden
and
sentimental
in
his
demand
to
protect
me
and
it
was
not
clear
whether
he
meant
his
protection
for
last
night
or
forever
but
i
am
happy
to
say
be
offered
me
no
word
that
was
not
honorable
and
he
saw
me
safely
here
to
miss
kingsley
iii
sister
and
brother
then
madeline
returned
to
the
little
parlor
with
the
brother
whom
she
had
hardly
recognized
majesty
he
exclaimed
to
think
of
your
being
here
the
warmth
stole
back
along
her
veins
she
remembered
how
that
pet
name
had
sounded
from
the
lips
of
this
brother
who
had
given
it
to
her
alfred
then
his
words
of
gladness
at
sight
of
her
his
chagrin
at
not
being
at
the
train
to
welcome
her
were
not
so
memorable
of
him
as
the
way
he
clasped
her
for
he
had
held
her
that
way
the
day
he
left
home
and
she
had
not
forgotten
but
now
he
was
so
much
taller
and
bigger
so
dusty
and
strange
and
different
and
forceful
that
she
could
scarcely
think
him
the
same
man
she
even
had
a
humorous
thought
that
here
was
another
cowboy
bullying
her
and
this
time
it
was
her
brother
dear
old
girl
he
said
more
calmly
as
he
let
her
go
you
changed
at
all
except
to
grow
lovelier
only
you
a
woman
now
and
you
fulfilled
the
name
i
gave
you
god
how
sight
of
you
brings
back
home
it
seems
a
hundred
years
since
i
left
i
missed
you
more
than
all
the
madeline
seemed
to
feel
with
his
every
word
that
she
was
remembering
him
she
was
so
amazed
at
the
change
in
him
that
she
could
not
believe
her
eyes
she
saw
a
bronzed
man
stalwart
superb
of
height
and
like
the
cowboys
belted
booted
spurred
and
there
was
something
hard
as
iron
in
his
face
that
quivered
with
his
words
it
seemed
that
only
in
those
moments
when
the
hard
lines
broke
and
softened
could
she
see
resemblance
to
the
face
she
remembered
it
was
his
manner
the
tone
of
his
voice
and
the
tricks
of
speech
that
proved
to
her
he
was
really
alfred
she
had
bidden
to
a
disgraced
disinherited
dissolute
boy
well
she
remembered
the
handsome
pale
face
with
its
weakness
and
shadows
and
careless
smile
with
the
cigarette
hanging
between
the
lips
the
years
had
passed
and
now
she
saw
him
a
man
the
west
had
made
him
a
man
and
madeline
hammond
felt
a
strong
passionate
gladness
and
gratefulness
and
a
direct
check
to
her
suddenly
inspired
hatred
of
the
west
majesty
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
i
all
broken
up
how
did
you
ever
do
it
but
never
mind
that
now
tell
me
about
that
brother
of
and
madeline
told
him
and
then
about
their
sister
helen
question
after
question
he
fired
at
her
and
she
told
him
of
her
mother
of
aunt
grace
who
had
died
a
year
ago
of
his
old
friends
married
scattered
vanished
but
she
did
not
tell
him
of
his
father
for
he
did
not
ask
quite
suddenly
the
questioning
ceased
he
choked
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
burst
into
tears
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
long
bitterness
was
flooding
away
it
hurt
her
to
see
him
hurt
her
more
to
hear
him
and
in
the
succeeding
few
moments
she
grew
closer
to
him
than
she
had
ever
been
in
the
past
had
her
father
and
mother
done
right
by
him
her
pulse
stirred
with
unwonted
quickness
she
did
not
speak
but
she
kissed
him
which
for
her
was
an
indication
of
unusual
feeling
and
when
he
recovered
command
over
his
emotions
he
made
no
reference
to
his
breakdown
nor
did
she
but
that
scene
struck
deep
into
madeline
hammond
heart
through
it
she
saw
what
he
had
lost
and
gained
alfred
why
did
you
not
answer
my
last
letters
asked
madeline
i
had
not
heard
from
you
for
two
so
long
how
time
flies
well
things
went
bad
with
me
about
the
last
time
i
heard
from
you
i
always
intended
to
write
some
day
but
i
never
things
went
wrong
tell
majesty
you
must
worry
yourself
with
my
troubles
i
want
you
to
enjoy
your
stay
and
not
be
bothered
with
my
please
tell
me
i
suspected
something
had
gone
wrong
that
is
partly
why
i
decided
to
come
all
right
if
you
must
know
he
began
and
it
seemed
to
madeline
that
there
was
a
gladness
in
his
decision
to
unburden
himself
you
remember
all
about
my
little
ranch
and
that
for
a
while
i
did
well
raising
stock
i
wrote
you
all
that
majesty
a
man
makes
enemies
anywhere
perhaps
an
eastern
man
in
the
west
can
make
if
not
so
many
certainly
more
bitter
ones
at
any
rate
i
made
several
there
was
a
cattleman
ward
by
name
he
gone
now
and
he
and
i
had
trouble
over
cattle
that
gave
me
a
pat
hawe
the
sheriff
here
has
been
instrumental
in
hurting
my
business
he
not
so
much
of
a
rancher
but
he
has
influence
at
santa
fe
and
el
paso
and
douglas
i
made
an
enemy
of
him
i
never
did
anything
to
him
he
hates
gene
stewart
and
upon
one
occasion
i
spoiled
a
little
plot
of
his
to
get
gene
in
his
clutches
the
real
reason
for
his
animosity
toward
me
is
that
he
loves
florence
and
florence
is
going
to
marry
alfred
what
the
matter
majesty
did
florence
impress
you
favorably
he
asked
with
a
keen
glance
why
yes
indeed
i
like
her
but
i
did
not
think
of
her
in
relation
to
you
that
way
i
am
greatly
surprised
alfred
is
she
well
born
what
connections
florence
is
just
a
girl
of
ordinary
people
she
was
born
in
kentucky
was
brought
up
in
texas
my
aristocratic
and
wealthy
family
would
scorn
alfred
you
are
still
a
hammond
said
madeline
with
uplifted
head
alfred
laughed
we
wo
quarrel
majesty
i
remember
you
and
in
spite
of
your
pride
you
got
a
heart
if
you
stay
here
a
month
you
love
florence
kingsley
i
want
you
to
know
she
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
straightening
me
up
well
to
go
on
with
my
story
there
don
carlos
a
mexican
rancher
and
he
my
worst
enemy
for
that
matter
he
as
bad
an
enemy
of
bill
stillwell
and
other
ranchers
stillwell
by
the
way
is
my
friend
and
one
of
the
finest
men
on
earth
i
got
in
debt
to
don
carlos
before
i
knew
he
was
so
mean
in
the
first
place
i
lost
money
at
faro
i
gambled
some
when
i
came
west
and
then
i
made
unwise
cattle
deals
don
carlos
is
a
wily
greaser
he
knows
the
ranges
he
has
the
water
and
he
is
dishonest
so
he
outfigured
me
and
now
i
am
practically
ruined
he
has
not
gotten
possession
of
my
ranch
but
only
a
matter
of
time
pending
lawsuits
at
santa
fe
at
present
i
have
a
few
hundred
cattle
running
on
stillwell
range
and
i
am
his
foreman
queried
madeline
i
am
simply
boss
of
stillwell
cowboys
and
right
glad
of
my
madeline
was
conscious
of
an
inward
burning
it
required
an
effort
for
her
to
retain
her
outward
tranquillity
annoying
consciousness
she
had
also
of
the
returning
sense
of
new
disturbing
emotions
she
began
to
see
just
how
walled
in
from
unusual
incident
and
sensation
had
been
her
exclusive
life
can
not
your
property
be
reclaimed
she
asked
how
much
do
you
owe
ten
thousand
dollars
would
clear
me
and
give
me
another
start
but
majesty
in
this
country
that
a
good
deal
of
money
and
i
have
been
able
to
raise
it
stillwell
in
worse
shape
than
i
madeline
went
over
to
alfred
and
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
we
must
not
be
in
he
stared
at
her
as
if
her
words
had
recalled
something
long
forgotten
then
he
smiled
how
imperious
you
are
i
forgotten
just
who
my
beautiful
sister
really
is
majesty
you
not
going
to
ask
me
to
take
money
from
you
i
well
i
not
do
it
i
never
did
even
when
i
was
in
college
and
then
there
was
much
beyond
listen
alfred
she
went
on
earnestly
this
is
entirely
different
i
had
only
an
allowance
then
you
had
no
way
to
know
that
since
i
last
wrote
you
i
had
come
into
my
inheritance
from
aunt
grace
it
was
well
that
does
matter
only
i
have
been
able
to
spend
half
the
income
it
mine
it
not
father
money
you
will
make
me
very
happy
if
you
consent
alfred
i
so
so
amazed
at
the
change
in
you
so
happy
you
must
never
take
a
backward
step
from
now
on
what
is
ten
thousand
dollars
to
me
sometimes
i
spend
that
in
a
month
i
throw
money
away
if
you
let
me
help
you
it
will
be
doing
me
good
as
well
as
you
please
he
kissed
her
evidently
surprised
at
her
earnestness
and
indeed
madeline
was
surprised
herself
once
started
her
speech
had
flowed
you
always
were
the
best
of
fellows
majesty
and
if
you
really
care
if
you
really
want
to
help
me
i
be
only
too
glad
to
accept
it
will
be
fine
florence
will
go
wild
and
that
greaser
wo
harass
me
any
more
majesty
pretty
soon
some
titled
fellow
will
be
spending
your
money
i
may
as
well
take
a
little
before
he
gets
it
all
he
finished
jokingly
what
do
you
know
about
me
she
asked
lightly
more
than
you
think
even
if
we
are
lost
out
here
in
the
woolly
west
we
get
news
everybody
knows
about
anglesbury
and
that
dago
duke
who
chased
you
all
over
europe
that
lord
castleton
has
the
running
now
and
seems
about
to
win
how
about
it
majesty
madeline
detected
a
hint
that
suggested
scorn
in
his
gay
speech
and
deep
in
his
searching
glance
she
saw
a
flame
she
became
thoughtful
she
had
forgotten
castleton
new
york
society
alfred
she
began
seriously
i
do
believe
any
titled
gentleman
will
ever
spend
my
money
as
you
elegantly
express
i
do
care
for
that
it
you
he
cried
passionately
and
he
grasped
her
with
a
violence
that
startled
her
he
was
white
his
eyes
were
now
like
fire
you
are
so
splendid
so
wonderful
people
called
you
the
american
beauty
but
you
more
than
that
you
the
american
girl
majesty
marry
no
man
unless
you
love
him
and
love
an
american
stay
away
from
europe
long
enough
to
learn
to
know
the
men
the
real
men
of
your
own
alfred
i
afraid
there
are
not
always
real
men
and
real
love
for
american
girls
in
international
marriages
but
helen
knows
this
be
her
choice
she
be
miserable
if
she
marries
it
serve
her
just
right
declared
her
brother
helen
was
always
crazy
for
glitter
adulation
fame
i
gamble
she
never
saw
more
of
anglesbury
than
the
gold
and
ribbons
on
his
i
am
sorry
anglesbury
is
a
gentleman
but
it
is
the
money
he
wanted
i
think
alfred
tell
me
how
you
came
to
know
about
me
out
here
you
may
be
assured
i
was
astonished
to
find
that
miss
kingsley
knew
me
as
majesty
i
imagine
it
was
a
surprise
he
replied
with
a
laugh
i
told
florence
about
you
gave
her
a
picture
of
you
and
of
course
being
a
woman
she
showed
the
picture
and
talked
she
in
love
with
you
then
my
dear
sister
we
do
get
new
york
papers
out
here
occasionally
and
we
can
see
and
read
you
may
not
be
aware
that
you
and
your
society
friends
are
objects
of
intense
interest
in
the
in
general
and
the
west
in
particular
the
papers
are
full
of
you
and
perhaps
a
lot
of
things
you
never
that
stewart
knew
too
he
said
not
majesty
hammond
never
mind
his
impudence
exclaimed
alfred
and
then
again
he
laughed
gene
is
all
right
only
you
got
to
know
him
i
tell
you
what
he
did
he
got
hold
of
one
of
those
newspaper
pictures
of
you
the
one
in
the
times
he
took
it
away
from
here
and
in
spite
of
florence
he
would
fetch
it
back
it
was
a
picture
of
you
in
with
your
horse
white
stockings
remember
it
was
taken
at
newport
well
stewart
tacked
the
picture
up
in
his
and
named
his
beautiful
horse
majesty
all
the
cowboys
knew
it
they
would
see
the
picture
and
tease
him
unmercifully
but
he
did
care
one
day
i
happened
to
drop
in
on
him
and
found
him
just
recovering
from
a
carouse
i
saw
the
picture
too
and
i
said
to
him
if
my
sister
knew
you
were
a
drunkard
she
not
be
proud
of
having
her
picture
stuck
up
in
your
room
majesty
he
did
not
touch
a
drop
for
a
month
and
when
he
did
drink
again
he
took
the
picture
down
and
he
has
never
put
it
madeline
smiled
at
her
brother
amusement
but
she
did
not
reply
she
simply
could
not
adjust
herself
to
these
queer
free
western
ways
her
brother
had
eloquently
pleaded
for
her
to
keep
herself
above
a
sordid
and
brilliant
marriage
yet
he
not
only
allowed
a
cowboy
to
keep
her
picture
in
his
room
but
actually
spoke
of
her
and
used
her
name
in
a
temperance
lecture
madeline
just
escaped
feeling
disgust
she
was
saved
from
this
however
by
nothing
less
than
her
brother
naive
gladness
that
through
subtle
suggestion
stewart
had
been
persuaded
to
be
good
for
a
month
something
made
up
of
stewart
effrontery
to
her
of
florence
kingsley
meeting
her
frankly
as
it
were
as
an
equal
of
the
elder
sister
slow
quiet
easy
acceptance
of
this
visitor
who
had
been
honored
at
the
courts
of
royalty
of
that
faint
hint
of
scorn
in
alfred
voice
and
his
amused
statement
in
regard
to
her
picture
and
the
name
majesty
something
made
up
of
all
these
stung
madeline
hammond
pride
alienated
her
for
an
instant
and
then
stimulated
her
intelligence
excited
her
interest
and
made
her
resolve
to
learn
a
little
about
this
incomprehensible
west
majesty
i
must
run
down
to
the
siding
he
said
consulting
his
watch
we
loading
a
shipment
of
cattle
i
be
back
by
and
bring
stillwell
with
me
you
like
him
give
me
the
check
for
your
she
went
into
the
little
bedroom
and
taking
up
her
bag
she
got
out
a
number
of
checks
six
six
trunks
he
exclaimed
well
i
very
glad
you
intend
to
stay
awhile
say
majesty
it
will
take
me
as
long
to
realize
who
you
really
are
as
it
take
to
break
you
of
being
a
tenderfoot
i
hope
you
packed
a
if
not
you
have
to
wear
trousers
you
have
to
do
that
anyway
when
we
go
up
in
the
no
you
sure
will
as
florence
we
shall
see
about
that
i
do
know
what
in
the
trunks
i
never
pack
anything
my
dear
brother
what
do
i
have
maids
for
how
did
it
come
that
you
did
travel
with
a
maid
i
wanted
to
be
alone
but
do
you
worry
i
shall
be
able
to
look
after
myself
i
dare
say
it
will
be
good
for
she
went
to
the
gate
with
him
what
a
shaggy
dusty
horse
he
wild
too
do
you
let
him
stand
that
way
without
being
haltered
i
should
think
he
would
run
tenderfoot
you
be
great
fun
majesty
especially
for
the
oh
will
i
she
asked
constrainedly
yes
and
in
three
days
they
will
be
fighting
one
another
over
you
that
going
to
worry
me
cowboys
fall
in
love
with
a
plain
woman
an
ugly
woman
any
woman
so
long
as
she
young
and
you
good
lord
they
go
out
of
their
you
are
pleased
to
be
facetious
alfred
i
think
i
have
had
quite
enough
of
cowboys
and
i
have
been
here
do
think
too
much
of
first
impressions
that
was
my
mistake
when
i
arrived
here
i
go
now
better
rest
awhile
you
look
the
horse
started
as
alfred
put
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
and
was
running
when
the
rider
slipped
his
leg
over
the
saddle
madeline
watched
him
in
admiration
he
seemed
to
be
loosely
fitted
to
the
saddle
moving
with
the
horse
i
suppose
that
a
cowboy
style
it
pleases
me
she
said
how
different
from
the
seat
of
eastern
riders
then
madeline
sat
upon
the
porch
and
fell
to
interested
observation
of
her
surrounding
near
at
hand
it
was
decidedly
not
prepossessing
the
street
was
deep
in
dust
and
the
cool
wind
whipped
up
little
puffs
the
houses
along
this
street
were
all
low
square
structures
made
of
some
kind
of
red
cement
it
occurred
to
her
suddenly
that
this
must
be
the
adobe
she
had
read
about
there
was
no
person
in
sight
the
long
street
appeared
to
have
no
end
though
the
line
of
houses
did
not
extend
far
once
she
heard
a
horse
trotting
at
some
distance
and
several
times
the
ringing
of
a
locomotive
bell
where
were
the
mountains
wondered
madeline
soon
low
over
the
she
saw
a
dim
rugged
outline
it
seemed
to
charm
her
eyes
and
fix
her
gaze
she
knew
the
adirondacks
she
had
seen
the
alps
from
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
and
had
stood
under
the
great
black
shadow
of
the
himalayas
but
they
had
not
drawn
her
as
these
remote
rockies
this
dim
horizon
line
boldly
cutting
the
blue
sky
fascinated
her
florence
kingsley
expression
beckoning
mountains
returned
to
madeline
she
could
not
see
or
feel
so
much
as
that
her
impression
was
rather
that
these
mountains
were
aloof
unattainable
that
if
approached
they
would
recede
or
vanish
like
the
desert
mirage
madeline
went
to
her
room
intending
to
rest
awhile
and
she
fell
asleep
she
was
aroused
by
florence
knock
and
call
miss
hammond
your
brother
has
come
back
with
why
how
i
have
slept
exclaimed
madeline
it
nearly
six
i
sure
glad
you
were
tired
and
the
air
here
makes
strangers
sleepy
come
we
want
you
to
meet
old
bill
he
calls
himself
the
last
of
the
cattlemen
he
has
lived
in
texas
and
here
all
his
madeline
accompanied
florence
to
the
porch
her
brother
who
was
sitting
near
the
door
jumped
up
and
said
hello
majesty
and
as
he
put
his
arm
around
her
he
turned
toward
a
massive
man
whose
broad
craggy
face
began
to
ripple
and
wrinkle
i
want
to
introduce
my
friend
stillwell
to
you
bill
this
is
my
sister
the
sister
i
so
often
told
you
about
wal
wal
al
this
the
proudest
meetin
of
my
life
replied
stillwell
in
a
booming
voice
he
extended
a
huge
hand
miss
miss
majesty
sight
of
you
is
as
welcome
as
the
rain
an
the
flowers
to
an
old
desert
madeline
greeted
him
and
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
repress
a
cry
at
the
way
he
crunched
her
hand
in
a
grasp
of
iron
he
was
old
with
long
furrows
down
his
checks
and
with
gray
eyes
almost
hidden
in
wrinkles
if
he
was
smiling
she
fancied
it
a
most
extraordinary
smile
the
next
instant
she
realized
that
it
had
been
a
smile
for
his
face
appeared
to
stop
rippling
the
light
died
and
suddenly
it
was
like
rudely
chiseled
stone
the
quality
of
hardness
she
had
seen
in
stewart
was
immeasurably
intensified
in
this
old
man
face
miss
majesty
it
plumb
humiliatin
to
all
of
us
thet
we
was
on
hand
to
meet
you
stillwell
said
me
an
al
stepped
into
the
an
said
a
few
mild
an
cheerful
things
them
messages
ought
to
hev
been
sent
out
to
the
ranch
i
sure
afraid
it
was
a
bit
unpleasant
fer
you
last
night
at
the
i
was
rather
anxious
at
first
and
perhaps
frightened
replied
madeline
wal
i
some
glad
to
tell
you
thet
there
no
man
in
these
parts
except
your
brother
thet
i
as
lief
hev
met
you
as
gene
indeed
yes
an
thet
takin
into
consideration
gene
weakness
too
allus
fond
of
sayin
of
myself
thet
i
the
last
of
the
old
cattlemen
wal
stewart
not
a
native
westerner
but
he
my
pick
of
the
last
of
the
cowboys
sure
he
young
but
he
the
last
of
the
old
style
the
picturesque
an
chivalrous
too
i
make
bold
to
say
miss
majesty
as
well
as
the
old
kind
folks
are
down
on
stewart
an
only
sayin
a
good
word
for
him
because
he
is
down
an
mebbe
last
night
he
might
hev
scared
you
you
bein
fresh
from
the
madeline
liked
the
old
fellow
for
his
loyalty
to
the
cowboy
he
evidently
cared
for
but
as
there
did
not
seem
anything
for
her
to
say
she
remained
silent
miss
majesty
the
day
of
the
cattleman
is
about
over
an
the
day
of
the
cowboy
such
as
gene
stewart
is
over
there
no
place
for
gene
if
these
were
modern
days
he
come
near
bein
a
same
as
we
had
in
texas
when
i
ranched
there
in
the
but
he
ca
fit
nowhere
now
he
ca
hold
a
job
an
he
goin
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
murmured
madeline
but
stillwell
these
modern
days
out
here
just
a
little
wild
yet
the
conductor
on
my
train
told
me
of
rebels
bandits
raiders
then
i
have
had
other
impressions
of
well
that
were
wild
enough
for
wal
it
some
more
pleasant
an
excitin
these
days
than
for
many
years
replied
stillwell
the
boys
hev
took
to
packin
guns
again
but
thet
owin
to
the
revolution
in
mexico
there
goin
to
be
trouble
along
the
border
i
reckon
people
in
the
east
do
know
there
is
a
revolution
wal
madero
will
oust
diaz
an
then
some
other
rebel
will
oust
madero
it
means
trouble
on
the
border
an
across
the
border
too
i
would
wonder
if
uncle
sam
hed
to
get
a
hand
in
the
game
already
been
holdups
on
the
railroads
an
raids
along
the
rio
grande
valley
an
these
little
towns
are
full
of
greasers
all
disturbed
by
the
fightin
down
in
mexico
we
been
hevin
an
some
i
hev
been
losin
a
few
cattle
right
along
reminds
me
of
old
times
an
pretty
soon
if
it
stop
i
take
the
way
to
stop
yes
indeed
majesty
put
in
alfred
you
have
hit
upon
an
interesting
time
to
visit
wal
thet
sure
to
be
so
rejoined
stillwell
stewart
got
in
trouble
down
heah
an
i
more
than
sorry
to
hev
to
tell
you
thet
your
name
figgered
in
it
but
i
could
blame
him
fer
i
sure
would
hev
done
the
same
that
so
queried
alfred
laughing
well
tell
us
about
madeline
simply
gazed
at
her
brother
and
though
he
seemed
amused
at
her
consternation
there
was
mortification
in
his
face
it
required
no
great
perspicuity
madeline
thought
to
see
that
stillwell
loved
to
talk
and
the
way
he
squared
himself
and
spread
his
huge
hands
over
his
knees
suggested
that
he
meant
to
do
this
opportunity
justice
miss
majesty
i
reckon
bein
as
you
in
the
west
now
thet
you
must
take
things
as
they
come
an
mind
each
thing
a
little
less
than
the
one
before
if
we
old
fellers
hed
been
thet
way
we
never
hev
lasted
last
night
was
particular
bad
ratin
with
some
other
nights
lately
there
was
much
doin
but
i
had
a
hard
knock
yesterday
when
we
started
in
with
a
bunch
of
cattle
i
sent
one
of
my
cowboys
danny
mains
along
ahead
carryin
money
i
hed
to
pay
off
hands
an
my
bills
an
i
wanted
thet
money
to
get
in
town
before
dark
wal
danny
was
held
up
i
do
distrust
the
lad
there

strange
greasers
in
town
lately
an
mebbe
they
knew
about
the
money
comin
wal
when
i
arrived
with
the
cattle
i
was
some
put
to
it
to
make
ends
meet
an
i
was
in
no
angelic
humor
when
i
hed
my
business
all
done
i
went
around
pokin
my
nose
beak
an
there
tryin
to
get
scent
of
thet
money
an
i
happened
in
at
a
hall
we
hev
thet
does
duty
fer
jail
an
hospital
an
an
what
not
wal
just
then
it
was
doin
duty
as
a
hospital
last
night
was
fiesta
night
these
greasers
hev
a
fiesta
every
week
or
so
an
one
greaser
who
hed
been
bad
hurt
was
layin
in
the
hall
where
he
hed
been
fetched
from
the
station
somebody
hed
sent
off
to
douglas
fer
a
doctor
but
be
hed
come
yet
i
hed
some
experience
with
gunshot
wounds
an
i
looked
this
feller
over
he
was
shot
up
much
but
i
thought
there
was
danger
of
anyway
i
did
all
i
could
the
hall
was
full
of
cowboys
ranchers
greasers
miners
an
town
folks
along
with
some
strangers
i
was
about
to
get
started
up
this
way
when
pat
hawe
come
in
pat
he
the
sheriff
i
reckon
miss
majesty
thet
sheriffs
are
new
to
you
an
fer
sake
of
the
west
i
explain
to
you
thet
we

of

so
ago
he
was
the
kind
of
sheriff
thet
helps
to
make
a

an
he
need
get
riled
about

an

askin
questions
about
the
wounded
greaser
when
gene

he
burst

this

suddenly
hawe
shut
up
an
with
his
red
mug
turnin
green
he
went
for
his
stillwell
paused
in
his
narrative
to
get
breath
and
he
wiped
his
moist
brow
and
now
his
face
began
to
lose
its
cragginess
it
changed
it
softened
it
rippled
and
wrinkled
and
all
that
strange
mobility
focused
and
shone
in
a
wonderful
smile
an
then
miss
majesty
then
there
was
somethin
happened
stewart
took
pat
gun
away
from
him
and
throwed
it
on
the
floor
an
what
followed
was
beautiful
sure
it
was
the
beautifulest
sight
i
ever
seen
only
it
was
over
so
soon
a
little
while
after
when
the
doctor
came
he
hed
another
patient
besides
the
wounded
greaser
an
he
said
thet
this
new
one
would
require
about
four
months
to
be
up
an
around
again
an
gene
stewart
hed
hit
the
trail
for
the
iv
a
ride
from
sunrise
to
sunset
next
morning
when
madeline
was
aroused
by
her
brother
it
was
not
yet
daybreak
the
air
chilled
her
and
in
the
gray
gloom
she
had
to
feel
around
for
matches
and
lamp
her
usual
languid
manner
vanished
at
a
touch
of
the
cold
water
presently
when
alfred
knocked
on
her
door
and
said
he
was
leaving
a
pitcher
of
hot
water
outside
she
replied
with
chattering
teeth
i
any
she
found
it
necessary
however
to
warm
her
numb
fingers
before
she
could
fasten
hooks
and
buttons
and
when
she
was
dressed
she
marked
in
the
dim
mirror
that
there
were
tinges
of
red
in
her
cheeks
well
if
i
have
some
color
she
exclaimed
breakfast
waited
for
her
in
the
the
sisters
ate
with
her
madeline
quickly
caught
the
feeling
of
brisk
action
that
seemed
to
be
in
the
air
from
the
back
of
the
house
sounded
the
tramp
of
boots
and
voices
of
men
and
from
outside
came
a
dull
thump
of
hoofs
the
rattle
of
harness
and
creak
of
wheels
then
alfred
came
stamping
in
majesty
here
where
you
get
the
real
thing
he
announced
merrily
we
rushing
you
off
i
sorry
to
say
but
we
must
hustle
back
to
the
ranch
the
fall
begins
you
will
ride
in
the
with
florence
and
stillwell
i
ride
on
ahead
with
the
boys
and
fix
up
a
little
for
you
at
the
ranch
your
baggage
will
follow
but
wo
get
there
till
sometime
it
a
long
ride
out
nearly
fifty
miles
by
flo
do
forget
a
couple
of
robes
wrap
her
up
well
and
hustle
getting
ready
we
a
little
later
when
madeline
went
out
with
florence
the
gray
gloom
was
lightening
horses
were
champing
bits
and
pounding
gravel
mawnin
miss
majesty
said
stillwell
gruffly
from
the
front
seat
of
a
high
vehicle
alfred
bundled
her
up
into
the
back
seat
and
florence
after
her
and
wrapped
them
with
robes
then
he
mounted
his
horse
and
started
off
growled
stillwell
and
with
a
crack
of
his
whip
the
team
jumped
into
a
trot
florence
whispered
into
madeline
ear
bill
grouchy
early
in
the
mawnin
he
thaw
out
soon
as
it
gets
it
was
still
so
gray
that
madeline
could
not
distinguish
objects
at
any
considerable
distance
and
she
left
el
cajon
without
knowing
what
the
town
really
looked
like
she
did
know
that
she
was
glad
to
get
out
of
it
and
found
an
easier
task
of
dispelling
persistent
haunting
memory
here
come
the
cowboys
said
florence
a
line
of
horsemen
appeared
coming
from
the
right
and
fell
in
behind
alfred
and
gradually
they
drew
ahead
to
disappear
from
sight
while
madeline
watched
them
the
gray
gloom
lightened
into
dawn
all
about
her
was
bare
and
dark
the
horizon
seemed
close
not
a
hill
nor
a
tree
broke
the
monotony
the
ground
appeared
to
be
flat
but
the
road
went
up
and
down
over
little
ridges
madeline
glanced
backward
in
the
direction
of
el
cajon
and
the
mountains
she
had
seen
the
day
before
and
she
saw
only
bare
and
dark
ground
like
that
which
rolled
before
a
puff
of
cold
wind
struck
her
face
and
she
shivered
florence
noticed
her
and
pulled
up
the
second
robe
and
tucked
it
closely
round
her
up
to
her
chin
if
we
have
a
little
wind
you
sure
feel
it
said
the
western
girl
madeline
replied
that
she
already
felt
it
the
wind
appeared
to
penetrate
the
robes
it
was
cold
pure
nipping
it
was
so
thin
she
had
to
breathe
as
fast
as
if
she
were
under
ordinary
exertion
it
hurt
her
nose
and
made
her
lungs
ache
are
you
asked
madeline
i
florence
laughed
i
used
to
it
i
never
get
the
western
girl
sat
with
ungloved
hands
on
the
outside
of
the
robe
she
evidently
did
not
need
to
draw
up
around
her
madeline
thought
she
had
never
seen
such
a
healthy
splendid
girl
do
you
like
to
see
the
sun
rise
asked
florence
yes
i
think
i
do
replied
madeline
thoughtfully
frankly
i
have
not
seen
it
for
we
have
beautiful
sunrises
and
sunsets
from
the
ranch
are
long
lines
of
pink
fire
ran
level
with
the
eastern
horizon
which
appeared
to
recede
as
day
brightened
a
bank
of
thin
fleecy
clouds
was
turning
rose
to
the
south
and
west
the
sky
was
dark
but
every
moment
it
changed
the
blue
turning
bluer
the
eastern
sky
was
opalescent
then
in
one
place
gathered
a
golden
light
and
slowly
concentrated
till
it
was
like
fire
the
rosy
bank
of
cloud
turned
to
silver
and
pearl
and
behind
it
shot
up
a
great
circle
of
gold
above
the
dark
horizon
gleamed
an
intensely
bright
disk
it
was
the
sun
it
rose
swiftly
blazing
out
the
darkness
between
the
ridges
and
giving
color
and
distance
to
the
sweep
of
land
wal
wal
drawled
stillwell
and
stretched
his
huge
arms
as
if
he
had
just
awakened
thet
somethin
florence
nudged
madeline
and
winked
at
her
fine
mawnin
girls
went
on
old
bill
cracking
his
whip
miss
majesty
it
be
some
oninterestin
ride
all
mawnin
but
when
we
get
up
a
bit
you
sure
like
it
there
look
to
the
southwest
jest
over
thet
farthest
madeline
swept
her
gaze
along
the
gray
sloping
to
where
spires
rose
far
beyond
the
ridge
peloncillo
mountains
said
stillwell
thet
home
when
we
get
there
we
wo
see
no
more
of
them
till
afternoon
when
they
rise
up
peloncillo
madeline
murmured
the
melodious
name
where
had
she
heard
it
then
she
remembered
the
cowboy
stewart
had
told
the
little
mexican
girl
bonita
to
hit
the
peloncillo
probably
the
girl
had
ridden
the
big
dark
horse
over
this
very
road
at
night
alone
madeline
had
a
little
shiver
that
was
not
occasioned
by
the
cold
wind
there
a
jack
cried
florence
suddenly
madeline
saw
her
first
it
was
as
large
as
a
dog
and
its
ears
were
enormous
it
appeared
to
be
impudently
tame
and
the
horses
kicked
dust
over
it
as
they
trotted
by
from
then
on
old
bill
and
florence
vied
with
each
other
in
calling
madeline
attention
to
many
things
along
the
way
coyotes
stealing
away
into
the
brush
buzzards
flapping
over
the
carcass
of
a
cow
that
had
been
mired
in
a
wash
queer
little
lizards
running
swiftly
across
the
road
cattle
grazing
in
the
hollows
adobe
huts
of
mexican
herders
wild
shaggy
horses
with
heads
high
watching
from
the
gray
ridges
all
these
things
madeline
looked
at
indifferently
at
first
because
indifference
had
become
habitual
with
her
and
then
with
an
interest
that
flourished
up
and
insensibly
grew
as
she
rode
on
it
grew
until
sight
of
a
little
ragged
mexican
boy
astride
the
most
diminutive
burro
she
had
ever
seen
awakened
her
to
the
truth
she
became
conscious
of
faint
unmistakable
awakening
of
feelings
enthusiasm
and
delight
when
she
realized
that
she
breathed
deep
of
the
cold
sharp
air
and
experienced
an
inward
joy
and
she
divined
then
though
she
did
not
know
why
that
henceforth
there
was
to
be
something
new
in
her
life
something
she
had
never
felt
before
something
good
for
her
soul
in
the
homely
the
commonplace
the
natural
and
the
wild
meanwhile
as
madeline
gazed
about
her
and
listened
to
her
companions
the
sun
rose
higher
and
grew
warm
and
soared
and
grew
hot
the
horses
held
tirelessly
to
their
steady
trot
and
mile
after
mile
of
rolling
land
slipped
by
from
the
top
of
a
ridge
madeline
saw
down
into
a
hollow
where
a
few
of
the
cowboys
had
stopped
and
were
sitting
round
a
fire
evidently
busy
at
the
noonday
meal
their
horses
were
feeding
on
the
long
gray
grass
wal
smell
of
thet
burnin
greasewood
makes
my
mouth
water
said
stillwell
i
sure
hungry
we
noon
hyar
an
let
the
hosses
rest
it
a
long
pull
to
the
he
halted
near
the
and
clambering
down
began
to
unharness
the
team
florence
leaped
out
and
turned
to
help
madeline
walk
round
a
little
she
said
you
must
be
cramped
from
sitting
still
so
long
i
get
lunch
madeline
got
down
glad
to
stretch
her
limbs
and
began
to
stroll
about
she
heard
stillwell
throw
the
harness
on
the
ground
and
slap
his
horses
roll
you
he
said
both
horses
bent
their
fore
legs
heaved
down
on
their
sides
and
tried
to
roll
over
one
horse
succeeded
on
the
fourth
try
and
then
heaved
up
with
a
satisfied
snort
and
shook
off
the
dust
and
gravel
the
other
one
failed
to
roll
over
and
gave
it
up
half
rose
to
his
feet
and
then
lay
down
on
the
other
side
he
sure
going
to
feel
the
ground
said
florence
smiling
at
madeline
miss
hammond
i
suppose
that
prize
horse
of
yours
white
stockings
would
spoil
his
coat
if
he
were
heah
to
roll
in
this
greasewood
and
during
madeline
observed
that
she
was
an
object
of
manifestly
great
interest
to
the
three
cowboys
she
returned
the
compliment
and
was
amused
to
see
that
a
glance
their
way
caused
them
painful
embarrassment
they
were
grown
men
one
of
whom
had
white
hair
yet
they
acted
like
boys
caught
in
the
act
of
stealing
a
forbidden
look
at
a
pretty
girl
cowboys
are
sure
all
flirts
said
florence
as
if
stating
an
uninteresting
fact
but
madeline
detected
a
merry
twinkle
in
her
clear
eyes
the
cowboys
heard
and
the
effect
upon
them
was
magical
they
fell
to
shamed
confusion
and
to
hurried
useless
tasks
madeline
found
it
difficult
to
see
where
they
had
been
bold
though
evidently
they
were
stricken
with
conscious
guilt
she
recalled
appraising
looks
of
critical
english
eyes
impudent
french
stares
burning
spanish
glances
gantlets
which
any
american
girl
had
to
run
abroad
compared
with
foreign
eyes
the
eyes
of
these
cowboys
were
those
of
smiling
eager
babies
haw
haw
roared
stillwell
florence
you
jest
hit
the
nail
on
the
haid
cowboys
are
all
plumb
flirts
i

wonderin
why

why
he
old

the
paw
of
both
you
girls
it
sure
is
amazin
a
silence
ensued
the
cowboy
nels
fussed
aimlessly
over
the
and
then
straightened
up
with
a
very
red
face
bill
you
a
liar
he
said
i
reckon
i
wo
stand
to
be
classed
with
booly
an
ned

this
range

way

he
replied
bluntly
his
levity
disappeared
and
the
red
wrinkles
narrowed
round
his
searching
eyes
jest
take
a
squint
at
these
hoss
tracks
said
nels
and
he
drew
stillwell
a
few
paces
aside
and
pointed
to
large
hoofprints
in
the
dust
i
reckon
you
know
the
hoss
thet
made
them
gene
stewart
roan
or
i
a
exclaimed
stillwell
and
he
dropped
heavily
to
his
knees
and
began
to
scrutinize
the
tracks
my
eyes
are
sure
pore
but
nels
they
ai
i
reckon
them
tracks
was
made
early
yesterday
wal
what

jest
foller
them

stillwell
walked
slowly
with
his
head
bent
muttering
to
himself
some
thirty
paces
or
more
from
the
he
stopped
short
and
again
flopped
to
his
knees
then
he
crawled
about
evidently
examining
horse
tracks
nels
whoever
was
straddlin
stewart
hoss
met
somebody
an
they
hauled
up
a
bit
but
did
git
tolerable
good
for
you
bill
thet
reasonin
replied
the
cowboy
stillwell
presently
got
up
and
walked
swiftly
to
the
left
for
some
rods
halted
and
faced
toward
the
southwest
then
retraced
his
steps
he
looked
at
the
imperturbable
cowboy
nels
i
do
like
this
a
little
he
growled
them
tracks
make
straight
fer
the
peloncillo
shore
replied
nels

impatiently
i

pretty
fond
of

gene

afraid

but

take
more
a
couple
of
days
we
ca
do
much
on
the
without
you
i
short
of
that
ended
the
conversation
stillwell
immediately
began
to
hitch
up
his
team
and
the
cowboys
went
out
to
fetch
their
strayed
horses
madeline
had
been
curiously
interested
and
she
saw
that
florence
knew
it
things
happen
miss
hammond
she
said
soberly
almost
sadly
madeline
thought
and
then
straightway
florence
began
brightly
to
hum
a
tune
and
to
busy
herself
repacking
what
was
left
of
the
lunch
madeline
conceived
a
strong
liking
and
respect
for
this
western
girl
she
admired
the
consideration
or
delicacy
or
wisdom
it
was
which
kept
florence
from
asking
her
what
she
knew
or
thought
or
felt
about
the
events
that
had
taken
place
soon
they
were
once
more
bowling
along
the
road
down
a
gradual
incline
and
then
they
began
to
climb
a
long
ridge
that
had
for
hours
hidden
what
lay
beyond
that
climb
was
rather
tiresome
owing
to
the
sun
and
the
dust
and
the
restricted
view
when
they
reached
the
summit
madeline
gave
a
little
gasp
of
pleasure
a
deep
gray
smooth
valley
opened
below
and
sloped
up
on
the
other
side
in
little
ridges
like
waves
and
these
led
to
the
foothills
dotted
with
clumps
of
brush
or
trees
and
beyond
rose
dark
mountains
and
wal
miss
majesty
now
we
gettin
somewhere
said
stillwell
cracking
his
whip
ten
miles
across
this
valley
an
we
be
in
the
foothills
where
the
apaches
used
to
ten
miles
exclaimed
madeline
it
looks
no
more
than
half
a
mile
to
wal
young
woman
before
you
go
to
ridin
off
alone
you
want
to
get
your
eyes
corrected
to
western
distance
now
what
you
call
them
black
things
off
there
on
the
slope
horsemen
no
cattle
replied
madeline
doubtfully
nope
jest
plain
cactus
an
over
hyar
look
down
the
valley
somethin
of
a
pretty
forest
ai
thet
he
asked
pointing
madeline
saw
a
beautiful
forest
in
the
center
of
the
valley
toward
the
south
wal
miss
majesty
thet
jest
this
deceivin
air
there
no
forest
it
a
indeed
how
beautiful
it
is
madeline
strained
her
gaze
on
the
dark
blot
and
it
seemed
to
float
in
the
atmosphere
to
have
no
clearly
defined
margins
to
waver
and
shimmer
and
then
it
faded
and
vanished
the
mountains
dropped
down
again
behind
the
horizon
and
presently
the
road
began
once
more
to
slope
up
the
horses
slowed
to
a
walk
there
was
a
mile
of
rolling
ridge
and
then
came
the
foothills
the
road
ascended
through
winding
valleys
trees
and
brush
and
rocks
began
to
appear
in
the
dry
ravines
there
was
no
water
yet
all
along
the
sandy
washes
were
indications
of
floods
at
some
periods
the
heat
and
the
dust
stifled
madeline
and
she
had
already
become
tired
still
she
looked
with
all
her
eyes
and
saw
birds
and
beautiful
quail
with
crests
and
rabbits
and
once
she
saw
a
deer
miss
majesty
said
stillwell
in
the
early
days
the
indians
made
this
country
a
bad
one
to
live
in
i
reckon
you
never
heerd
much
about
them
times
surely
you
was
hardly
born
then
i
hev
to
tell
you
some
day
how
i
fought
comanches
in
the
panhandle
thet
was
northern
texas
an
i
had
some
mighty
scares
in
this
country
with
he
told
her
about
cochise
chief
of
the
chiricahua
apaches
the
most
savage
and
bloodthirsty
tribe
that
ever
made
life
a
horror
for
the
pioneer
cochise
befriended
the
whites
once
but
he
was
the
victim
of
that
friendliness
and
he
became
the
most
implacable
of
foes
then
geronimo
another
apache
chief
had
as
late
as
gone
on
the
and
had
left
a
bloody
trail
down
the
new
mexico
and
arizona
line
almost
to
the
border
lone
ranchmen
and
cowboys
had
been
killed
and
mothers
had
shot
their
children
and
then
themselves
at
the
approach
of
the
apache
the
name
apache
curdled
the
blood
of
any
woman
of
the
southwest
in
those
days
madeline
shuddered
and
was
glad
when
the
old
frontiersman
changed
the
subject
and
began
to
talk
of
the
settling
of
that
country
by
the
spaniards
the
legends
of
lost
handed
down
to
the
mexicans
and
strange
stories
of
heroism
and
mystery
and
religion
the
mexicans
had
not
advanced
much
in
spite
of
the
spread
of
civilization
to
the
southwest
they
were
still
superstitious
and
believed
the
legends
of
treasures
hidden
in
the
walls
of
their
missions
and
that
unseen
hands
rolled
rocks
down
the
gullies
upon
the
heads
of
prospectors
who
dared
to
hunt
for
the
lost
mines
of
the
padres
up
in
the
mountains
back
of
my
ranch
there
a
lost
mine
said
stillwell
mebbe
it
only
a
legend
but
somehow
i
believe
it
there
other
lost
mines
hev
been
found
an
as
fer
the
rollin
stones
i
sure
know
thet
true
as
any
one
can
find
out
if
he
goes
trailin
up
the
gulch
mebbe
thet
only
the
weatherin
of
the
cliffs
it
a
sleepy
strange
country
this
southwest
an
miss
majesty
you
to
love
it
you
call
it
wal
i
reckon
is
correct
a
feller
gets
lazy
out
hyar
an
dreamy
an
he
wants
to
put
off
work
till
some
folks
say
it
a
land
of
manana
a
land
of
thet
the
mexican
of
it
but
i
like
best
to
think
of
what
a
lady
said
to
me
onct
an
eddicated
lady
like
you
miss
majesty
wal
she
said
it
a
land
where
it
always
afternoon
i
liked
thet
i
always
get
up
sore
in
the
mawnin
an
feel
good
till
noon
but
in
the
afternoon
i
get
sorta
warm
an
like
things
an
sunset
is
my
time
i
reckon
i
do
want
nothin
any
finer
than
sunset
from
my
ranch
you
look
out
over
a
valley
that
spreads
wide
between
guadalupe
mountains
an
the
chiricahuas
down
across
the
red
arizona
desert
clear
to
the
sierra
madres
in
mexico
two
hundred
miles
miss
majesty
an
all
as
clear
as
print
an
the
sun
sets
behind
all
thet
when
my
time
comes
to
die
i
like
it
to
be
on
my
porch
smokin
my
pipe
an
facin
the
so
the
old
cattleman
talked
on
while
madeline
listened
and
florence
dozed
in
her
seat
and
the
sun
began
to
wane
and
the
horses
climbed
steadily
presently
at
the
foot
of
the
steep
ascent
stillwell
got
out
and
walked
leading
the
team
during
this
long
climb
fatigue
claimed
madeline
and
she
drowsily
closed
her
eyes
to
find
when
she
opened
them
again
that
the
glaring
white
sky
had
changed
to
a
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
the
foothills
and
the
air
was
growing
chilly
stillwell
had
returned
to
the
and
was
chuckling
to
the
horses
shadows
crept
up
out
of
the
hollows
wal
flo
said
stillwell
i
reckon
we
better
hev
the
rest
of
thet
there
lunch
before
you
did
leave
much
of
it
laughed
florence
as
she
produced
the
basket
from
under
the
seat
while
they
ate
the
short
twilight
shaded
and
gloom
filled
the
hollows
madeline
saw
the
first
star
a
faint
winking
point
of
light
the
sky
had
now
changed
to
a
hazy
gray
madeline
saw
it
gradually
clear
and
darken
to
show
other
faint
stars
after
that
there
was
perceptible
deepening
of
the
gray
and
an
enlarging
of
the
stars
and
a
brightening
of
ones
night
seemed
to
come
on
the
cold
wind
madeline
was
glad
to
have
the
robes
close
around
her
and
to
lean
against
florence
the
hollows
were
now
black
but
the
tops
of
the
foothills
gleamed
pale
in
a
soft
light
the
steady
tramp
of
the
horses
went
on
and
the
creak
of
wheels
and
crunching
of
gravel
madeline
grew
so
sleepy
that
she
could
not
keep
her
weary
eyelids
from
falling
there
were
drowsier
spells
in
which
she
lost
a
feeling
of
where
she
was
and
these
were
disturbed
by
the
jolt
of
wheels
over
a
rough
place
then
came
a
blank
interval
short
or
long
which
ended
in
a
more
violent
lurch
of
the
buckboard
madeline
awoke
to
find
her
head
on
florence
shoulder
she
sat
up
laughing
and
apologizing
for
her
laziness
florence
assured
her
they
would
soon
reach
the
ranch
madeline
observed
then
that
the
horses
were
once
more
trotting
the
wind
was
colder
the
night
darker
the
flatter
and
the
sky
was
now
a
wonderful
deep
blazing
with
millions
of
stars
some
of
them
were
magnificent
how
strangely
white
and
alive
again
madeline
felt
the
insistence
of
familiar
yet
baffling
associations
these
white
stars
called
strangely
to
her
or
haunted
her
the
it
was
a
crackling
and
roaring
of
fire
that
awakened
madeline
next
morning
and
the
first
thing
she
saw
was
a
huge
stone
fireplace
in
which
lay
a
bundle
of
blazing
sticks
some
one
had
kindled
a
fire
while
she
slept
for
a
moment
the
curious
sensation
of
being
lost
returned
to
her
she
just
dimly
remembered
reaching
the
ranch
and
being
taken
into
a
huge
house
and
a
huge
dimly
lighted
room
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
gone
to
sleep
at
once
and
had
awakened
without
remembering
how
she
had
gotten
to
bed
but
she
was
wide
awake
in
an
instant
the
bed
stood
near
one
end
of
an
enormous
chamber
the
adobe
walls
resembled
a
hall
in
an
ancient
feudal
castle
with
great
darkened
rafters
running
across
the
ceiling
the
few
articles
of
furniture
were
worn
out
and
sadly
dilapidated
light
flooded
into
the
room
from
two
windows
on
the
right
of
the
fireplace
and
two
on
the
left
and
another
large
window
near
the
bedstead
looking
out
from
where
she
lay
madeline
saw
a
dark
slow
of
mountain
her
eyes
returned
to
the
cheery
snapping
fire
and
she
watched
it
while
gathering
courage
to
get
up
the
room
was
cold
when
she
did
slip
her
bare
feet
out
upon
the
stone
floor
she
very
quickly
put
them
back
under
the
warm
blankets
and
she
was
still
in
bed
trying
to
pluck
up
her
courage
when
with
a
knock
on
the
door
and
a
cheerful
greeting
florence
entered
carrying
steaming
hot
water
good
mawnin
miss
hammond
hope
you
slept
well
you
sure
were
tired
last
night
i
imagine
you
find
this
old
rancho
house
as
cold
as
a
barn
it
warm
up
directly
al
gone
with
the
boys
and
bill
we
to
ride
down
on
the
range
after
a
while
when
your
baggage
florence
wore
a
woolen
blouse
with
a
scarf
round
her
neck
a
short
corduroy
divided
skirt
and
boots
and
while
she
talked
she
energetically
heaped
up
the
burning
wood
in
the
fireplace
and
laid
madeline
clothes
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
heated
a
rug
and
put
that
on
the
floor
by
the
bedside
and
lastly
with
a
sweet
direct
smile
she
said
al
told
me
and
i
sure
saw
myself
that
you
were
used
to
being
without
your
maid
will
you
let
me
help
you
thank
you
i
am
going
to
be
my
own
maid
for
a
while
i
expect
i
do
appear
a
very
helpless
individual
but
really
i
do
not
feel
so
perhaps
i
have
had
just
a
little
too
much
waiting
all
right
breakfast
will
be
ready
soon
and
after
that
we
look
about
the
madeline
was
charmed
with
the
old
spanish
house
and
the
more
she
saw
of
it
the
more
she
thought
what
a
delightful
home
it
could
be
made
all
the
doors
opened
into
a
courtyard
or
patio
as
florence
called
it
the
house
was
low
in
the
shape
of
a
rectangle
and
so
immense
in
size
that
madeline
wondered
if
it
had
been
a
spanish
barracks
many
of
the
rooms
were
dark
without
windows
and
they
were
empty
others
were
full
of
ranchers
implements
and
sacks
of
grain
and
bales
of
hay
florence
called
these
last
alfalfa
the
house
itself
appeared
strong
and
well
preserved
and
it
was
very
picturesque
but
in
the
were
only
the
barest
necessities
and
these
were
worn
out
and
comfortless
however
when
madeline
went
outdoors
she
forgot
the
cheerless
bare
interior
florence
led
the
way
out
on
a
porch
and
waved
a
hand
at
a
vast
colored
void
that
what
bill
likes
she
said
at
first
madeline
could
not
tell
what
was
sky
and
what
was
land
the
immensity
of
the
scene
stunned
her
faculties
of
conception
she
sat
down
in
one
of
the
old
and
looked
and
looked
and
knew
that
she
was
not
grasping
the
reality
of
what
stretched
wondrously
before
her
we
up
at
the
edge
of
the
foothills
florence
said
you
remember
we
rode
around
the
northern
end
of
the
mountain
range
well
that
behind
us
now
and
you
look
down
across
the
line
into
arizona
and
mexico
that
long
slope
of
gray
is
the
head
of
the
san
bernardino
valley
straight
across
you
see
the
black
chiricahua
mountains
and
away
down
to
the
south
the
guadalupe
mountains
that
awful
red
gulf
between
is
the
desert
and
far
far
beyond
the
dim
blue
peaks
are
the
sierra
madres
in
madeline
listened
and
gazed
with
straining
eyes
and
wondered
if
this
was
only
a
stupendous
mirage
and
why
it
seemed
so
different
from
all
else
that
she
had
seen
and
so
endless
so
baffling
so
grand
it
sure
take
you
a
little
while
to
get
used
to
being
up
high
and
seeing
so
much
explained
florence
that
the
secret
we
up
high
the
air
is
clear
and
there
the
whole
bare
world
beneath
us
it
somehow
rest
you
well
it
will
now
see
those
specks
in
the
valley
they
are
stations
little
towns
the
railroad
goes
down
that
way
the
largest
speck
is
chiricahua
it
over
forty
miles
by
trail
here
round
to
the
north
you
can
see
don
carlos
rancho
he
fifteen
miles
off
and
i
sure
wish
he
were
a
thousand
that
little
green
square
about
between
here
and
don
carlos
that
al
ranch
just
below
us
are
the
adobe
houses
of
the
mexicans
there
a
church
too
and
here
to
the
left
you
see
stillwell
corrals
and
and
his
stables
all
falling
to
pieces
the
ranch
has
gone
to
ruin
all
the
ranches
are
going
to
ruin
but
most
of
them
are
little
affairs
and
here
see
that
cloud
of
dust
down
in
the
valley
it
the
the
boys
are
there
and
the
cattle
wait
i
get
the
by
their
aid
madeline
saw
in
the
foreground
a
great
dense
herd
of
cattle
with
dark
thick
streams
and
dotted
lines
of
cattle
leading
in
every
direction
she
saw
streaks
and
clouds
of
dust
running
horses
and
a
band
of
horses
grazing
and
she
descried
horsemen
standing
still
like
sentinels
and
others
in
action
the
i
want
to
know
all
about
it
to
see
it
declared
madeline
please
tell
me
what
it
means
what
it
for
and
then
take
me
down
it
sure
a
sight
miss
hammond
i
be
glad
to
take
you
down
but
i
fancy
you
not
want
to
go
close
few
eastern
people
who
regularly
eat
their
choice
cuts
of
roast
beef
and
porterhouse
have
any
idea
of
the
open
range
and
the
struggle
cattle
have
to
live
and
the
hard
life
of
cowboys
it
sure
open
your
eyes
miss
hammond
i
glad
you
care
to
know
your
brother
would
have
made
a
big
success
in
this
cattle
business
if
it
had
been
for
crooked
work
by
rival
ranchers
he
make
it
yet
in
spite
of
indeed
he
shall
replied
madeline
but
tell
me
please
all
about
the
well
in
the
first
place
every
cattleman
has
to
have
a
brand
to
identify
his
stock
without
it
no
cattleman
nor
half
a
hundred
cowboys
if
he
had
so
many
could
ever
recognize
all
the
cattle
in
a
big
herd
there
are
no
fences
on
our
ranges
they
are
all
open
to
everybody
some
day
i
hope
we
be
rich
enough
to
fence
a
range
the
different
herds
graze
together
every
calf
has
to
be
caught
if
possible
and
branded
with
the
mark
of
its
mother
that
no
easy
job
a
maverick
is
an
unbranded
calf
that
has
been
weaned
and
shifts
for
itself
the
maverick
then
belongs
to
the
man
who
finds
it
and
brands
it
these
little
calves
that
lose
their
mothers
sure
have
a
cruel
time
of
it
many
of
them
die
then
the
coyotes
and
wolves
and
lions
prey
on
them
every
year
we
have
two
big
but
the
boys
do
some
branding
all
the
year
a
calf
should
be
branded
as
soon
as
it
found
this
is
a
safeguard
against
we
do
have
the
rustling
of
herds
and
bunches
of
cattle
like
we
used
to
but
there
always
the
and
always
will
be
as
long
as
there
the
thieves
have
a
good
many
cunning
tricks
they
kill
the
calf
mother
or
slit
the
calf
tongue
so
it
ca
suck
and
so
loses
its
mother
they
steal
and
hide
a
calf
and
watch
it
till
it
big
enough
to
fare
for
itself
and
then
brand
it
they
make
imperfect
brands
and
finish
them
at
a
later
time
we
have
our
big
in
the
fall
when
there
plenty
of
grass
and
water
and
all
the
as
well
as
the
cattle
are
in
fine
shape
the
cattlemen
in
the
valley
meet
with
their
cowboys
and
drive
in
all
the
cattle
they
can
find
then
they
brand
and
cut
out
each
man
herd
and
drive
it
toward
home
then
they
go
on
up
or
down
the
valley
make
another
camp
and
drive
in
more
cattle
it
takes
weeks
there
are
so
many
greasers
with
little
bands
of
stock
and
they
are
crafty
and
greedy
bill
says
he
knows
greaser
cowboys
vaqueros
who
never
owned
a
steer
or
a
cow
and
now
they
got
growing
herds
the
same
might
be
said
of
more
than
one
white
cowboy
but
there
not
as
much
of
that
as
there
used
to
and
the
horses
i
want
to
know
about
them
said
madeline
when
florence
paused
oh
the
well
they
sure
are
interesting
broncos
the
boys
call
them
wild
they
wilder
than
the
steers
they
have
to
chase
bill
got
broncos
heah
that
never
have
been
broken
and
never
will
be
and
not
every
boy
can
ride
them
either
the
vaqueros
have
the
finest
horses
don
carlos
has
a
black
that
i
give
anything
to
own
and
he
has
other
fine
stock
gene
stewart
big
roan
is
a
mexican
horse
the
swiftest
and
proudest
i
ever
saw
i
was
up
on
him
once
and
oh
he
can
run
he
likes
a
woman
too
and
that
sure
something
i
want
in
a
horse
i
heard
al
and
bill
talking
at
breakfast
about
a
horse
for
you
they
were
wrangling
bill
wanted
you
to
have
one
and
al
another
it
was
funny
to
hear
them
finally
they
left
the
choice
to
me
until
the
is
over
then
i
suppose
every
cowboy
on
the
range
will
offer
you
his
best
mount
come
let
go
out
to
the
corrals
and
look
over
the
few
horses
for
madeline
the
morning
hours
flew
by
with
a
goodly
part
of
the
time
spent
on
the
porch
gazing
out
over
that
vista
at
noon
a
teamster
drove
up
with
her
trunks
then
while
florence
helped
the
mexican
woman
get
lunch
madeline
unpacked
part
of
her
effects
and
got
out
things
for
which
she
would
have
immediate
need
after
lunch
she
changed
her
dress
for
a
and
going
outside
found
florence
waiting
with
the
horses
the
western
girl
clear
eyes
seemed
to
take
stock
of
appearance
in
one
swift
inquisitive
glance
and
then
shone
with
pleasure
you
sure
look
you
a
picture
miss
hammond
that
is
a
new
one
what
it
look
like
on
me
or
another
woman
i
ca
imagine
but
on
you
it
it
stunning
bill
wo
let
you
go
within
a
mile
of
the
cowboys
if
they
see
you
that
be
the
finish
of
the
while
they
rode
down
the
slope
florence
talked
about
the
open
ranges
of
new
mexico
and
arizona
water
is
scarce
she
said
if
bill
could
afford
to
pipe
water
down
from
the
mountains
he
have
the
finest
ranch
in
the
she
went
on
to
tell
that
the
climate
was
mild
in
winter
and
hot
in
summer
warm
sunshiny
days
prevailed
nearly
all
the
year
round
some
summers
it
rained
and
occasionally
there
would
be
a
dry
year
the
dreaded
ano
seco
of
the
mexicans
rain
was
always
expected
and
prayed
for
in
the
midsummer
months
and
when
it
came
the
sprang
up
making
the
valleys
green
from
mountain
to
mountain
the
intersecting
valleys
ranging
between
the
long
slope
of
foothills
afforded
the
best
pasture
for
cattle
and
these
were
jealously
sought
by
the
mexicans
who
had
only
small
herds
to
look
after
stillwell
cowboys
were
always
chasing
these
vaqueros
off
land
that
belonged
to
stillwell
he
owned
twenty
thousand
acres
of
unfenced
land
adjoining
the
open
range
don
carlos
possessed
more
acreage
than
that
and
his
cattle
were
always
mingling
with
stillwell
and
in
turn
don
carlos
vaqueros
were
always
chasing
stillwell
cattle
away
from
the
mexican
bad
feeling
had
been
manifested
for
years
and
now
relations
were
strained
to
the
as
madeline
rode
along
she
made
good
use
of
her
eyes
the
soil
was
sandy
and
porous
and
she
understood
why
the
rain
and
water
from
the
few
springs
disappeared
so
quickly
at
a
little
distance
the
appeared
thick
but
near
at
hand
it
was
seen
to
be
sparse
bunches
of
greasewood
and
cactus
plants
were
interspersed
here
and
there
in
the
grass
what
surprised
madeline
was
the
fact
that
though
she
and
florence
had
seemed
to
be
riding
quite
awhile
they
had
apparently
not
drawn
any
closer
to
the
the
slope
of
the
valley
was
noticeable
only
after
some
miles
had
been
traversed
looking
forward
madeline
imagined
the
valley
only
a
few
miles
wide
she
would
have
been
sure
she
could
walk
her
horse
across
it
in
an
hour
yet
that
black
bold
range
of
chiricahua
mountains
was
distant
a
long
day
journey
for
even
a
cowboy
it
was
only
by
looking
back
that
madeline
could
grasp
the
true
relation
of
things
she
could
not
be
deceived
by
distance
she
had
covered
gradually
the
black
dots
enlarged
and
assumed
shape
of
cattle
and
horses
moving
round
a
great
dusty
patch
in
another
madeline
rode
behind
florence
to
the
outskirts
of
the
scene
of
action
they
drew
rein
near
a
huge
wagon
in
the
neighborhood
of
which
were
more
than
a
hundred
horses
grazing
and
whistling
and
trotting
about
and
lifting
heads
to
watch
the
four
cowboys
stood
mounted
guard
over
this
drove
of
horses
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
out
was
a
dusty
melee
a
roar
of
tramping
hoofs
filled
madeline
ears
the
lines
of
marching
cattle
had
merged
into
a
great
moving
herd
half
obscured
by
dust
i
can
make
little
of
what
is
going
on
said
madeline
i
want
to
go
they
trotted
across
half
the
intervening
distance
and
when
florence
halted
again
madeline
was
still
not
satisfied
and
asked
to
be
taken
nearer
this
time
before
they
reined
in
again
al
hammond
saw
them
and
wheeled
his
horse
in
their
direction
he
yelled
something
which
madeline
did
not
understand
and
then
halted
them
close
enough
he
called
and
in
the
din
his
voice
was
not
very
clear
it
not
safe
wild
steers
i
glad
you
came
girls
majesty
what
do
you
think
of
that
bunch
of
cattle
madeline
could
scarcely
reply
what
she
thought
for
the
noise
and
dust
and
ceaseless
action
confused
her
they
milling
al
said
florence
we
just
rounded
them
up
they
milling
and
that
bad
the
vaqueros
are
hard
drivers
they
beat
us
all
hollow
and
we
drove
some
he
was
wet
with
sweat
black
with
dust
and
out
of
breath
i
off
now
flo
my
sister
will
have
enough
of
this
in
about
two
minutes
take
her
back
to
the
wagon
i
tell
bill
you
here
and
run
in
whenever
i
get
a
the
bawling
and
bellowing
the
crackling
of
horns
and
pounding
of
hoofs
the
dusty
whirl
of
cattle
and
the
flying
cowboys
disconcerted
madeline
and
frightened
her
a
little
but
she
was
intensely
interested
and
meant
to
stay
there
until
she
saw
for
herself
what
that
strife
of
sound
and
action
meant
when
she
tried
to
take
in
the
whole
scene
she
did
not
make
out
anything
clearly
and
she
determined
to
see
it
little
by
little
will
you
stay
longer
asked
florence
and
receiving
an
affirmative
reply
she
warned
madeline
if
a
runaway
steer
or
angry
cow
comes
this
way
let
your
horse
go
he
get
out
of
the
that
lent
the
situation
excitement
and
madeline
became
absorbed
the
great
mass
of
cattle
seemed
to
be
eddying
like
a
whirlpool
and
from
that
madeline
understood
the
significance
of
the
range
word
but
when
madeline
looked
at
one
end
of
the
herd
she
saw
cattle
standing
still
facing
outward
and
calves
cringing
close
in
fear
the
motion
of
the
cattle
slowed
from
the
inside
of
the
herd
to
the
outside
and
gradually
ceased
the
roar
and
tramp
of
hoofs
and
crack
of
horns
and
thump
of
heads
also
ceased
in
degree
but
the
bawling
and
bellowing
continued
while
she
watched
the
herd
spread
grew
less
dense
and
stragglers
appeared
to
be
about
to
bolt
through
the
line
of
mounted
cowboys
from
that
moment
so
many
things
happened
and
so
swiftly
that
madeline
could
not
see
a
tenth
of
what
was
going
on
within
eyesight
it
seemed
horsemen
darted
into
the
herd
and
drove
out
cattle
madeline
pinned
her
gaze
on
one
cowboy
who
rode
a
white
horse
and
was
chasing
a
steer
he
whirled
a
lasso
around
his
head
and
threw
it
the
rope
streaked
out
and
the
loop
caught
the
leg
of
the
steer
the
white
horse
stopped
with
wonderful
suddenness
and
the
steer
slid
in
the
dust
quick
as
a
flash
the
cowboy
was
out
of
the
saddle
and
grasping
the
legs
of
the
steer
before
it
could
rise
he
tied
them
with
a
rope
it
had
all
been
done
almost
as
quickly
as
thought
another
man
came
with
what
madeline
divined
was
a
he
applied
it
to
the
flank
of
the
steer
then
it
seemed
the
steer
was
up
with
a
jump
wildly
looking
for
some
way
to
run
and
the
cowboy
was
circling
his
lasso
madeline
saw
fires
in
the
background
with
a
man
in
charge
evidently
heating
the
irons
then
this
same
cowboy
roped
a
heifer
which
bawled
lustily
when
the
hot
iron
seared
its
hide
madeline
saw
the
smoke
rising
from
the
touch
of
the
iron
and
the
sight
made
her
shrink
and
want
to
turn
away
but
she
resolutely
fought
her
sensitiveness
she
had
never
been
able
to
bear
the
sight
of
any
animal
suffering
the
rough
work
in
men
lives
was
as
a
sealed
book
to
her
and
now
for
some
reason
beyond
her
knowledge
she
wanted
to
see
and
hear
and
learn
some
of
the
duties
that
made
up
those
lives
look
miss
hammond
there
don
carlos
said
florence
look
at
that
black
horse
madeleine
saw
a
mexican
riding
by
he
was
too
far
away
for
her
to
distinguish
his
features
but
he
reminded
her
of
an
italian
brigand
he
bestrode
a
magnificent
horse
stillwell
rode
up
to
the
girls
then
and
greeted
them
in
his
big
voice
right
in
the
thick
of
it

this
juncture

the
group

in
search
of
stillwell
bill

he

his
prettiest
ambrose
is
a
ladies
man
he
the
two
men
and
florence
joined
in
a
little
pleasant
teasing
of
madeline
and
drew
her
attention
to
what
appeared
to
be
really
unnecessary
feats
of
horsemanship
all
made
in
her
vicinity
the
cowboys
evinced
their
interest
in
covert
glances
while
recoiling
a
lasso
or
while
passing
to
and
fro
it
was
all
too
serious
for
madeline
to
be
amused
at
that
moment
she
did
not
care
to
talk
she
sat
her
horse
and
watched
the
lithe
dark
vaqueros
fascinated
her
they
were
here
there
everywhere
with
lariats
flying
horses
plunging
back
jerking
calves
and
yearlings
to
the
grass
they
were
cruel
to
their
mounts
cruel
to
their
cattle
madeline
winced
as
the
great
silver
rowels
of
the
spurs
went
plowing
into
the
flanks
of
their
horses
she
saw
these
spurs
stained
with
blood
choked
with
hair
she
saw
the
vaqueros
break
the
legs
of
calves
and
let
them
lie
till
a
white
cowboy
came
along
and
shot
them
calves
were
jerked
down
and
dragged
many
yards
steers
were
pulled
by
one
leg
these
vaqueros
were
the
most
superb
horsemen
madeline
had
ever
seen
and
she
had
seen
the
cossacks
and
tatars
of
the
russian
steppes
they
were
swift
graceful
daring
they
never
failed
to
catch
a
running
steer
and
the
lassoes
always
went
true
what
sharp
dashes
the
horses
made
and
wheelings
here
and
there
and
sudden
stops
and
how
they
braced
themselves
to
withstand
the
shock
the
cowboys
likewise
showed
wonderful
horsemanship
and
reckless
as
they
were
madeline
imagined
she
saw
consideration
for
steed
and
cattle
that
was
wanting
in
the
vaqueros
they
changed
mounts
oftener
than
the
mexican
riders
and
the
horses
they
unsaddled
for
fresh
ones
were
not
so
spent
so
wet
so
covered
with
lather
it
was
only
after
an
hour
or
more
of
observation
that
madeline
began
to
realize
the
exceedingly
toilsome
and
dangerous
work
cowboys
had
to
perform
there
was
little
or
no
rest
for
them
they
were
continually
among
wild
and
vicious
and
steers
in
many
instances
they
owed
their
lives
to
their
horses
the
danger
came
mostly
when
the
cowboy
leaped
off
to
tie
and
brand
a
calf
he
had
thrown
some
of
the
cows
charged
with
lowered
twisting
horns
time
and
again
madeline
heart
leaped
to
her
throat
for
fear
a
man
would
be
gored
one
cowboy
roped
a
calf
that
bawled
loudly
its
mother
dashed
in
and
just
missed
the
kneeling
cowboy
as
he
rolled
over
then
he
had
to
run
and
he
could
not
run
very
fast
he
was
and
appeared
awkward
madeline
saw
another
cowboy
thrown
and
nearly
run
over
by
a
plunging
steer
his
horse
bolted
as
if
it
intended
to
leave
the
range
then
close
by
madeline
a
big
steer
went
down
at
the
end
of
a
lasso
the
cowboy
who
had
thrown
it
nimbly
jumped
down
and
at
that
moment
his
horse
began
to
rear
and
prance
and
suddenly
to
lower
his
head
close
to
the
ground
and
kick
high
he
ran
round
in
a
circle
the
fallen
steer
on
the
taut
lasso
acting
as
a
pivot
the
cowboy
loosed
the
rope
from
the
steer
and
then
was
dragged
about
on
the
grass
it
was
almost
frightful
for
madeline
to
see
that
cowboy
go
at
his
horse
but
she
recognized
the
mastery
and
skill
then
two
horses
came
into
collision
on
the
run
one
horse
went
down
the
rider
of
the
other
was
unseated
and
was
kicked
before
he
could
get
up
this
fellow
limped
to
his
mount
and
struck
at
him
while
the
horse
showed
his
teeth
in
a
vicious
attempt
to
bite
all
the
while
this
ceaseless
activity
was
going
on
there
was
a
strange
uproar
bawl
and
bellow
the
shock
of
heavy
bodies
meeting
and
falling
the
shrill
jabbering
of
the
vaqueros
and
the
shouts
and
banterings
of
the
cowboys
they
took
sharp
orders
and
replied
in
jest
they
went
about
this
stern
toil
as
if
it
were
a
game
to
be
played
in
good
humor
one
sang
a
rollicking
song
another
whistled
another
smoked
a
cigarette
the
sun
was
hot
and
they
like
their
horses
were
dripping
with
sweat
the
characteristic
red
faces
had
taken
on
so
much
dust
that
cowboys
could
not
be
distinguished
from
vaqueros
except
by
the
difference
in
dress
blood
was
not
wanting
on
tireless
hands
the
air
was
thick
oppressive
rank
with
the
smell
of
cattle
and
of
burning
hide
madeline
began
to
sicken
she
choked
with
dust
was
almost
stifled
by
the
odor
but
that
made
her
all
the
more
determined
to
stay
there
florence
urged
her
to
come
away
or
at
least
move
back
out
of
the
worst
of
it
stillwell
seconded
florence
madeline
however
smilingly
refused
then
her
brother
said
here
this
is
making
you
sick
and
she
replied
that
she
intended
to
stay
until
the
day
work
ended
al
gave
her
a
strange
look
and
made
no
more
comment
the
kindly
stillwell
then
began
to
talk

thousands
of
sharp
horns
but
it
does
madeline
saw
a
very
short
wizened
little
man
ludicrously
with
a
face
the
color
and
hardness
of
a
cinder
he
was
hobbling
by
toward
the
wagon
and
one
of
his
short
crooked
legs
dragged
not
much
to
look
at
is
he
went
on
stillwell
wal
i
know
natural
thet
we
all
best
pleased
by
good
looks
in
any
one
even
a
man
it
hed
ought
to
be
thet
way
monty
price
looks
like
hell
but
appearances
are
sure
deceivin
monty
saw
years
of
ridin
along
the
missouri
bottoms
the
big
prairies
where
there
high
grass
sometimes
fires
in
montana
they
have
blizzards
that
freeze
cattle
standin
in
their
tracks
an
hosses
freeze
to
death
they
tell
me
thet
a
drivin
sleet
in
the
face
with
the
mercury
forty
below
is
somethin
to
ride
against
you
ca
get
monty
to
say
much
about
cold
all
you
hev
to
do
is
to
watch
him
how
he
hunts
the
sun
it
never
gets
too
hot
fer
monty
wal
i
reckon
he
was
a
little
more
prepossessin
once
the
story
thet
come
to
us
about
monty
is
this
he
got
caught
out
in
a
prairie
fire
an
could
hev
saved
himself
easy
but
there
was
a
lone
ranch
right
in
the
line
of
fire
an
monty
knowed
the
rancher
was
away
an
his
wife
an
baby
was
home
he
knowed
too
the
way
the
wind
was
thet
the
would
burn
it
was
a
long
chance
he
was
takin
but
he
went
over
put
the
woman
up
behind
him
wrapped
the
baby
an
his
hoss
haid
in
a
wet
blanket
an
rode
away
thet
was
sure
some
ride
i
heerd
but
the
fire
ketched
monty
at
the
last
the
woman
fell
an
was
lost
an
then
his
hoss
an
monty
ran
an
walked
an
crawled
through
the
fire
with
thet
baby
an
he
saved
it
monty
was
never
much
good
as
a
cowboy
after
thet
he
could
hold
no
jobs
wal
he
have
one
with
me
as
long
as
i
have
a
steer
vi
a
gift
and
a
purchase
for
a
week
the
scene
of
the
lay
within
of
the
and
madeline
passed
most
of
this
time
in
the
saddle
watching
the
strenuous
labors
of
the
vaqueros
and
cowboys
she
overestimated
her
strength
and
more
than
once
had
to
be
lifted
from
her
horse
stillwell
pleasure
in
her
attendance
gave
place
to
concern
he
tried
to
persuade
her
to
stay
away
from
the
and
florence
grew
even
more
solicitous
madeline
however
was
not
moved
by
their
entreaties
she
grasped
only
dimly
the
truth
of
what
it
was
she
was
learning
something
infinitely
more
than
the
rounding
up
of
cattle
by
cowboys
and
she
was
loath
to
lose
an
hour
of
her
opportunity
her
brother
looked
out
for
her
as
much
as
his
duties
permitted
but
for
several
days
he
never
once
mentioned
her
growing
fatigue
and
the
strain
of
excitement
or
suggested
that
she
had
better
go
back
to
the
house
with
florence
many
times
she
felt
the
drawing
power
of
his
keen
blue
eyes
on
her
face
and
at
these
moments
she
sensed
more
than
brotherly
regard
he
was
watching
her
studying
her
weighing
her
and
the
conviction
was
vaguely
disturbing
it
was
disquieting
for
madeline
to
think
that
alfred
might
have
guessed
her
trouble
from
time
to
time
he
brought
cowboys
to
her
and
introduced
them
and
laughed
and
jested
trying
to
make
the
ordeal
less
embarrassing
for
these
men
so
little
used
to
women
before
the
week
was
out
however
alfred
found
occasion
to
tell
her
that
it
would
be
wiser
for
her
to
let
the
go
on
without
gracing
it
further
with
her
presence
he
said
it
laughingly
nevertheless
he
was
serious
and
when
madeline
turned
to
him
in
surprise
he
said
bluntly
i
do
like
the
way
don
carlos
follows
you
around
bill
afraid
that
nels
or
ambrose
or
one
of
the
cowboys
will
take
a
fall
out
of
the
mexican
they
itching
for
the
chance
of
course
dear
it
absurd
to
you
but
it
absurd
it
certainly
was
yet
it
served
to
show
madeline
how
intensely
occupied
she
had
been
with
her
own
feelings
roused
by
the
tumult
and
toil
of
the
she
recalled
that
don
carlos
had
been
presented
to
her
and
that
she
had
not
liked
his
dark
striking
face
with
its
bold
prominent
glittering
eyes
and
sinister
lines
and
she
had
not
liked
his
suave
sweet
insinuating
voice
or
his
subtle
manner
with
its
slow
bows
and
gestures
she
had
thought
he
looked
handsome
and
dashing
on
the
magnificent
black
horse
however
now
that
alfred
words
made
her
think
she
recalled
that
wherever
she
had
been
in
the
field
the
noble
horse
with
his
saddle
and
his
dark
rider
had
been
always
in
her
vicinity
don
carlos
has
been
after
florence
for
a
long
time
said
alfred
not
a
young
man
by
any
means
he
fifty
bill
says
but
you
can
seldom
tell
a
mexican
age
from
his
looks
don
carlos
is
well
educated
and
a
man
we
know
very
little
about
mexicans
of
his
stamp
do
regard
women
as
we
white
men
do
now
my
dear
beautiful
sister
from
new
york
i
have
much
use
for
don
carlos
but
i
do
want
nels
or
ambrose
to
make
a
wild
throw
with
a
rope
and
pull
the
don
off
his
horse
so
you
had
better
ride
up
to
the
house
and
stay
alfred
you
are
joking
teasing
me
said
madeline
indeed
not
replied
alfred
how
about
it
flo
florence
replied
that
the
cowboys
would
upon
the
slightest
provocation
treat
don
carlos
with
less
ceremony
and
gentleness
than
a
roped
steer
old
bill
stillwell
came
up
to
be
importuned
by
alfred
regarding
the
conduct
of
cowboys
on
occasion
and
he
not
only
corroborated
the
assertion
but
added
emphasis
and
evidence
of
his
own
an
miss
majesty
he
concluded
i
reckon
if
gene
stewart
was
fer
me
thet
grinnin
greaser
would
hev
hed
a
bump
in
the
dust
before
madeline
had
been
wavering
between
sobriety
and
laughter
until
stillwell
mention
of
his
ideal
of
cowboy
chivalry
decided
in
favor
of
the
laughter
i
am
not
convinced
but
i
surrender
she
said
you
have
only
some
occult
motive
for
driving
me
away
i
am
sure
that
handsome
don
carlos
is
being
unjustly
suspected
but
as
i
have
seen
a
little
of
singular
imagination
and
gallantry
i
am
rather
inclined
to
fear
their
possibilities
so
then
she
rode
with
florence
up
the
long
gray
slope
to
the
that
night
she
suffered
from
excessive
weariness
which
she
attributed
more
to
the
strange
working
of
her
mind
than
to
riding
and
sitting
her
horse
morning
however
found
her
in
no
disposition
to
rest
it
was
not
activity
that
she
craved
or
excitement
or
pleasure
an
unerring
instinct
rising
dear
from
the
thronging
sensations
of
the
last
few
days
told
her
that
she
had
missed
something
in
life
it
could
not
have
been
love
for
she
loved
brother
sister
parents
friends
it
could
not
have
been
consideration
for
the
poor
the
unfortunate
the
hapless
she
had
expressed
her
sympathy
for
these
by
giving
freely
it
could
not
have
been
pleasure
culture
travel
society
wealth
position
fame
for
these
had
been
hers
all
her
life
whatever
this
something
was
she
had
baffling
intimations
of
it
hopes
that
faded
on
the
verge
of
realizations
haunting
promises
that
were
unfulfilled
whatever
it
was
it
had
remained
hidden
and
unknown
at
home
and
here
in
the
west
it
began
to
allure
and
drive
her
to
discovery
therefore
she
could
not
rest
she
wanted
to
go
and
see
she
was
no
longer
chasing
phantoms
it
was
a
hunt
for
treasure
that
held
aloof
as
intangible
as
the
substance
of
dreams
that
morning
she
spoke
a
desire
to
visit
the
mexican
quarters
lying
at
the
base
of
the
foothills
florence
protested
that
this
was
no
place
to
take
madeline
but
madeline
insisted
and
it
required
only
a
few
words
and
a
persuading
smile
to
win
florence
over
from
the
porch
the
cluster
of
adobe
houses
added
a
picturesque
touch
of
color
and
contrast
to
the
waste
of
gray
valley
near
at
hand
they
proved
the
enchantment
lent
by
distance
they
were
old
crumbling
broken
down
squalid
a
few
goats
climbed
around
upon
them
a
few
mangy
dogs
barked
announcement
of
visitors
and
then
a
troop
of
dirty
ragged
children
ran
out
they
were
very
shy
and
at
first
retreated
in
affright
but
kind
words
and
smiles
gained
their
confidence
and
then
they
followed
in
a
body
gathering
a
quota
of
new
children
at
each
house
madeline
at
once
conceived
the
idea
of
doing
something
to
better
the
condition
of
these
poor
mexicans
and
with
this
in
mind
she
decided
to
have
a
look
indoors
she
fancied
she
might
have
been
an
apparition
judging
from
the
effect
her
presence
had
upon
the
first
woman
she
encountered
while
florence
exercised
what
little
spanish
she
had
command
of
trying
to
get
the
women
to
talk
madeline
looked
about
the
miserable
little
rooms
and
there
grew
upon
her
a
feeling
of
sickness
which
increased
as
she
passed
from
one
house
to
another
she
had
not
believed
such
squalor
could
exist
anywhere
in
america
the
huts
reeked
with
filth
vermin
crawled
over
the
dirt
floors
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
of
water
and
she
believed
what
florence
told
her
that
these
people
never
bathed
there
was
little
evidence
of
labor
idle
men
and
women
smoking
cigarettes
lolled
about
some
silent
others
jabbering
they
did
not
resent
the
visit
of
the
american
women
nor
did
they
show
hospitality
they
appeared
stupid
disease
was
rampant
in
these
houses
when
the
doors
were
shut
there
was
no
ventilation
and
even
with
the
doors
open
madeline
felt
choked
and
stifled
a
powerful
penetrating
odor
pervaded
the
rooms
that
were
less
stifling
than
others
and
this
odor
florence
explained
came
from
a
liquor
the
mexicans
distilled
from
a
cactus
plant
here
drunkenness
was
manifest
a
terrible
inert
drunkenness
that
made
its
victims
deathlike
madeline
could
not
extend
her
visit
to
the
little
she
saw
a
padre
a
starved
man
who
she
instinctively
felt
was
good
she
managed
to
mount
her
horse
and
ride
up
to
the
house
but
once
there
she
weakened
and
florence
had
almost
to
carry
her
she
fought
off
a
faintness
only
to
succumb
to
it
when
alone
in
her
room
still
she
did
not
entirely
lose
consciousness
and
soon
recovered
to
the
extent
that
she
did
not
require
assistance
upon
the
morning
after
the
end
of
the
when
she
went
out
on
the
porch
her
brother
and
stillwell
appeared
to
be
arguing
about
the
identity
of
a
horse
wal
i
reckon
it
my
old
roan
said
stillwell
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
bill
if
that
is
stewart
horse
my
eyes
are
going
back
on
me
replied
al
it
not
the
color
or
shape
the
distance
is
too
far
to
judge
by
that
it
the
motion
the
al
mebbe
you
right
but
they
ai
no
rider
up
on
thet
hoss
flo
fetch
my
florence
went
into
the
house
while
madeline
tried
to
discover
the
object
of
attention
presently
far
up
the
gray
hollow
along
a
foothill
she
saw
dust
and
then
the
dark
moving
figure
of
a
horse
she
was
watching
when
florence
returned
with
the
glass
bill
took
a
long
look
adjusted
the
glasses
carefully
and
tried
again
wal
i
hate
to
admit
my
eyes
are
gettin
pore
but
i
guess
i
hev
to
thet
gene
stewart
hoss
saddled
an
comin
at
a
fast
clip
without
a
rider
it
amazin
strange
an
some
in
keepin
with
other
things
concernin
give
me
the
glass
said
al
yes

was
right
bill
the
horse
is
not
frightened
he
coming
steadily
he
got
something
on
his
thet
a
trained
hoss
al
he
has
more
sense
than
some
men
i
know
take
a
look
with
the
glasses
up
the
hollow
see
anybody
swing
up
over
the
foothills
where
the
trail
leads
higher
along
thet
ridge
where
the
rocks
begin
see
anybody
by
jove
bill
two
horses
but
i
ca
make
out
much
for
dust
they
are
climbing
fast
one
horse
gone
among
the
rocks
there
the
other
gone
what
do
you
make
of
that
wal
i
ca
make
no
more
you
but
i
bet
we
know
somethin
soon
fer
gene
hoss
is
comin
faster
as
he
nears
the
the
wide
hollow
sloping
up
into
the
foothills
lay
open
to
unobstructed
view
and
less
than
half
a
mile
distant
madeline
saw
the
riderless
horse
coming
along
the
white
trail
at
a
rapid
canter
she
watched
him
recalling
the
circumstances
under
which
she
had
first
seen
him
and
then
his
wild
flight
through
the
dimly
lighted
streets
of
el
cajon
out
into
the
black
night
she
thrilled
again
and
believed
she
would
never
think
of
that
starry
night
adventure
without
a
thrill
she
watched
the
horse
and
felt
more
than
curiosity
a
shrill
piercing
whistle
pealed
in
wal
he
seen
us
thet
sure
said
bill
the
horse
neared
the
corrals
disappeared
into
a
lane
and
then
breaking
his
gait
again
thundered
into
the
inclosure
and
pounded
to
a
halt
some
twenty
yards
from
where
stillwell
waited
for
him
one
look
at
him
at
close
range
in
the
clear
light
of
day
was
enough
for
madeline
to
award
him
a
blue
ribbon
over
all
horses
even
her
white
stockings
the
cowboy
great
steed
was
no
lithe
mustang
he
was
a
charger
almost
tremendous
of
build
with
a
black
coat
faintly
mottled
in
gray
and
it
shone
like
polished
glass
in
the
sun
evidently
he
had
been
carefully
dressed
down
for
this
occasion
for
there
was
no
dust
on
him
nor
a
kink
in
his
beautiful
mane
nor
a
mark
on
his
glossy
hide
come
hyar
you
said
stillwell
the
horse
dropped
his
head
snorted
and
came
obediently
up
he
was
neither
shy
nor
wild
he
poked
a
friendly
nose
at
stillwell
and
then
looked
at
al
and
the
women
unhooking
the
stirrups
from
the
pommel
stillwell
let
them
fall
and
began
to
search
the
saddle
for
something
which
he
evidently
expected
to
find
presently
from
somewhere
among
the
trappings
he
produced
a
folded
bit
of
paper
and
after
scrutinizing
it
handed
it
to
al
addressed
to
you
an
i
bet
you
two
bits
i
know
what
in
it
he
said
alfred
unfolded
the
letter
read
it
and
then
looked
at
stillwell
bill
you
a
pretty
good
guesser
gene
made
for
the
border
he
sent
the
horse
by
somebody
no
names
mentioned
and
wants
my
sister
to
have
him
if
she
will
any
mention
of
danny
mains
asked
the
rancher
not
a
thet
bad
gene
know
about
danny
if
anybody
did
but
he
a
cuss
so
he
sure
hittin
for
mexico
wonder
if
goin
too
wal
there
two
of
the
best
cowmen
i
ever
seen
gone
to
hell
an
i
with
that
he
bowed
his
head
and
grumbling
to
himself
went
into
the
house
alfred
lifted
the
reins
over
the
head
of
the
horse
and
leading
him
to
madeline
slipped
the
knot
over
her
arm
and
placed
the
letter
in
her
hand
majesty
i
accept
the
horse
he
said
stewart
is
only
a
cowboy
now
and
as
tough
as
any
i
known
but
he
comes
of
a
good
family
he
was
a
college
man
and
a
gentleman
once
he
went
to
the
bad
out
here
like
so
many
fellows
go
like
i
nearly
did
then
he
had
told
me
about
his
sister
and
mother
he
cared
a
good
deal
for
them
i
think
he
has
been
a
source
of
unhappiness
to
them
it
was
mostly
when
he
was
reminded
of
this
in
some
way
that
he
get
drunk
i
have
always
stuck
to
him
and
i
would
do
so
yet
if
i
had
the
chance
you
can
see
bill
is
heartbroken
about
danny
mains
and
stewart
i
think
he
rather
hoped
to
get
good
news
not
much
chance
of
them
coming
back
now
at
least
not
in
the
case
of
stewart
this
giving
up
his
horse
means
he
going
to
join
the
rebel
forces
across
the
border
what
would
i
give
to
see
that
cowboy
break
loose
on
a
bunch
of
greasers
oh
damn
the
luck
i
beg
your
pardon
majesty
but
i
upset
too
i
sorry
about
stewart
i
liked
him
pretty
well
before
he
thrashed
that
coyote
of
a
sheriff
pat
hawe
and
afterward
i
guess
i
liked
him
more
you
read
the
letter
sister
and
accept
the
in
silence
madeline
bent
her
gaze
from
her
brother
face
to
the
letter
friend
al
i
sending
my
horse
down
to
you
because
i
going
away
and
have
the
nerve
to
take
him
where
he
get
hurt
or
fall
into
strange
hands
if
you
think
it
all
right
why
give
him
to
your
sister
with
my
respects
but
if
you
do
like
the
idea
al
or
if
she
wo
have
him
then
he
for
you
i
not
forgetting
your
kindness
to
me
even
if
i
never
showed
it
and
al
my
horse
has
never
felt
a
quirt
or
a
spur
and
i
like
to
think
you
never
hurt
him
i
hoping
your
sister
will
take
him
she
be
good
to
him
and
she
can
afford
to
take
care
of
him
and
while
i
waiting
to
be
plugged
by
a
greaser
bullet
if
i
happen
to
have
a
picture
in
mind
of
how
she
look
upon
my
horse
why
man
it
not
going
to
make
any
difference
to
you
she
need
ever
know
it
between
you
and
me
al
do
let
her
or
flo
ride
alone
over
don
carlos
way
if
i
had
time
i
could
tell
you
something
about
that
slick
greaser
and
tell
your
sister
if
there
ever
any
reason
for
her
to
run
away
from
anybody
when
she
up
on
that
roan
just
let
her
lean
over
and
yell
in
his
ear
she
find
herself
riding
the
wind
so
long
gene
stewart
madeline
thoughtfully
folded
the
letter
and
murmured
how
he
must
love
his
horse
well
i
should
say
so
replied
alfred
flo
will
tell
you
she
the
only
person
gene
ever
let
ride
that
horse
unless
as
bill
thinks
the
little
mexican
girl
bonita
rode
him
out
of
el
cajon
the
other
night
well
sister
mine
how
about
it
will
you
accept
the
horse
assuredly
and
very
happy
indeed
am
i
to
get
him
al
you
said
i
think
that
stewart
named
him
after
me
saw
my
nickname
in
the
new
york
paper
well
i
will
not
change
his
name
but
al
how
shall
i
ever
climb
up
on
him
he
taller
than
i
am
what
a
giant
of
a
horse
oh
look
at
him
he
nosing
my
hand
i
really
believe
he
understood
what
i
said
al
did
you
ever
see
such
a
splendid
head
and
such
beautiful
eyes
they
are
so
large
and
dark
and
soft
and
human
oh
i
am
a
fickle
woman
for
i
am
forgetting
white
i
gamble
he
make
you
forget
any
other
horse
said
alfred
you
have
to
get
on
him
from
the
as
madeline
was
not
dressed
for
the
saddle
she
did
not
attempt
to
mount
come
majesty
how
strange
that
sounds
we
must
get
acquainted
you
have
now
a
new
owner
a
very
severe
young
woman
who
will
demand
loyalty
from
you
and
obedience
and
some
day
after
a
decent
period
she
will
expect
madeline
led
the
horse
to
and
fro
and
was
delighted
with
his
gentleness
she
discovered
that
he
did
not
need
to
be
led
he
came
at
her
call
followed
her
like
a
pet
dog
rubbed
his
black
muzzle
against
her
sometimes
at
the
turns
in
their
walk
he
lifted
his
head
and
with
ears
forward
looked
up
the
trail
by
which
he
had
come
and
beyond
the
foothills
he
was
looking
over
the
range
some
one
was
calling
to
him
perhaps
from
beyond
the
mountains
madeline
liked
him
the
better
for
that
memory
and
pitied
the
wayward
cowboy
who
had
parted
with
his
only
possession
for
very
love
of
it
that
afternoon
when
alfred
lifted
madeline
to
the
back
of
the
big
roan
she
felt
high
in
the
air
we
have
a
run
out
to
the
mesa
said
her
brother
as
he
mounted
keep
a
tight
rein
on
him
and
ease
up
when
you
want
him
to
go
faster
but
do
yell
in
his
ear
unless
you
want
florence
and
me
to
see
you
disappear
on
the
he
trotted
out
of
the
yard
down
by
the
corrals
to
come
out
on
the
edge
of
a
gray
open
flat
that
stretched
several
miles
to
the
slope
of
a
mesa
florence
led
and
madeline
saw
that
she
rode
like
a
cowboy
alfred
drew
on
to
her
side
leaving
madeline
in
the
rear
then
the
leading
horses
broke
into
a
gallop
they
wanted
to
run
and
madeline
felt
with
a
thrill
that
she
would
hardly
be
able
to
keep
majesty
from
running
even
if
she
wanted
to
he
sawed
on
the
tight
bridle
as
the
others
drew
away
and
broke
from
pace
to
gallop
then
florence
put
her
horse
into
a
run
alfred
turned
and
called
to
madeline
to
come
along
this
will
never
do
they
are
running
away
from
us
said
madeline
and
she
eased
up
her
hold
on
the
bridle
something
happened
beneath
her
just
then
she
did
not
know
at
first
exactly
what
as
much
as
she
had
been
on
horseback
she
had
never
ridden
at
a
running
gait
in
new
york
it
was
not
decorous
or
safe
so
when
majesty
lowered
and
stretched
and
changed
the
stiff
jolting
gallop
for
a
wonderful
smooth
gliding
run
it
required
madeline
some
moments
to
realize
what
was
happening
it
did
not
take
long
for
her
to
see
the
distance
diminishing
between
her
and
her
companions
still
they
had
gotten
a
goodly
start
and
were
far
advanced
she
felt
the
steady
even
rush
of
the
wind
it
amazed
her
to
find
how
easily
comfortably
she
kept
to
the
saddle
the
experience
was
new
the
one
fault
she
had
heretofore
found
with
riding
was
the
violent
in
this
instance
she
experienced
nothing
of
that
kind
no
strain
no
necessity
to
hold
on
with
a
desperate
awareness
of
work
she
had
never
felt
the
wind
in
her
face
the
whip
of
a
horse
mane
the
buoyant
level
spring
of
a
tanning
gait
it
thrilled
her
exhilarated
her
fired
her
blood
suddenly
she
found
herself
alive
throbbing
and
inspired
by
she
knew
not
what
she
loosened
the
bridle
and
leaning
far
forward
she
cried
oh
you
splendid
fellow
run
she
heard
from
under
her
a
sudden
quick
clattering
roar
of
hoofs
and
she
swayed
back
with
the
wonderfully
swift
increase
in
majesty
speed
the
wind
stung
her
face
howled
in
her
ears
tore
at
her
hair
the
gray
plain
swept
by
on
each
side
and
in
front
seemed
to
be
waving
toward
her
in
her
blurred
sight
florence
and
alfred
appeared
to
be
coming
back
but
she
saw
presently
upon
nearer
view
that
majesty
was
overhauling
the
other
horses
was
going
to
pass
them
indeed
he
did
pass
them
shooting
by
so
as
almost
to
make
them
appear
standing
still
and
he
ran
on
not
breaking
his
gait
till
he
reached
the
steep
side
of
the
mesa
where
he
slowed
down
and
stopped
glorious
exclaimed
madeline
she
was
all
in
a
blaze
and
every
muscle
and
nerve
of
her
body
tingled
and
quivered
her
hands
as
she
endeavored
to
put
up
the
loosened
strands
of
hair
trembled
and
failed
of
their
accustomed
dexterity
then
she
faced
about
and
waited
for
her
companions
alfred
reached
her
first
laughing
delighted
yet
also
a
little
anxious
holy
smoke
but
ca
he
run
did
he
bolt
on
you
no
i
called
in
his
ear
replied
madeline
so
that
was
it
that
the
woman
of
you
and
forbidden
fruit
flo
said
she
do
it
the
minute
she
was
on
him
majesty
you
can
ride
see
if
flo
does
say
the
western
girl
came
up
then
with
her
pleasure
bright
in
her
face
it
was
just
great
to
see
you
how
your
hair
burned
in
the
wind
al
she
sure
can
ride
oh
i
so
glad
i
was
a
little
afraid
and
that
horse
is
he
grand
ca
he
run
alfred
led
the
way
up
the
steep
zigzag
trail
to
the
top
of
the
mesa
madeline
saw
a
beautiful
flat
surface
of
short
grass
level
as
a
floor
she
uttered
a
little
cry
of
wonder
and
enthusiasm
al
what
a
place
for
golf
this
would
be
the
finest
links
in
the
well
i
thought
of
that
myself
he
replied
the
only
trouble
would
be
could
anybody
stop
looking
at
the
scenery
long
enough
to
hit
a
ball
majesty
look
and
then
it
seemed
that
madeline
was
confronted
by
a
spectacle
too
sublime
and
terrible
for
her
gaze
the
immensity
of
this
world
descending
incalculable
distances
refused
to
be
grasped
and
awed
her
shocked
her
once
majesty
when
i
first
came
out
west
i
was
down
and
out
determined
to
end
it
all
said
alfred
and
happened
to
climb
up
here
looking
for
a
lonely
place
to
die
when
i
saw
that
i
changed
my
madeline
was
silent
she
remained
so
during
the
ride
around
the
rim
of
the
mesa
and
down
the
steep
trail
this
time
alfred
and
florence
failed
to
tempt
her
into
a
race
she
had
been
she
had
been
exalted
she
had
been
confounded
and
she
recovered
slowly
without
divining
exactly
what
had
come
to
her
she
reached
the
far
behind
her
companions
and
at
was
unusually
thoughtful
later
when
they
assembled
on
the
porch
to
watch
the
sunset
stillwell
humorous
complainings
inspired
the
inception
of
an
idea
which
flashed
up
in
her
mind
swift
as
lightning
and
then
by
listening
sympathetically
she
encouraged
him
to
recite
the
troubles
of
a
poor
cattleman
they
were
many
and
long
and
interesting
and
rather
numbing
to
the
life
of
her
inspired
idea
mr
stillwell
could
ranching
here
on
a
large
scale
with
methods
be
made
well
not
profitable
exactly
but
to
pay
to
run
without
loss
she
asked
determined
to
kill
her
idea
at
birth
or
else
give
it
breath
and
hope
of
life
wal
i
reckon
it
could
he
replied
with
a
short
laugh
it
sure
be
a
why
with
all
my
bad
luck
an
poor
equipment
i
lived
pretty
well
an
paid
my
debts
an
have
really
lost
any
money
except
the
original
outlay
i
reckon
thet
sunk
fer
would
you
sell
if
some
one
would
pay
your
price
miss
majesty
i
jump
at
the
chance
yet
somehow
i
hate
to
leave
hyar
i
jest
be
fool
enough
to
go
sink
the
money
in
another

the
rancher
and

so
he
dropped
his
pipe
then
with
his
clumsy
huge
fingers
he
refilled
it
relighted
it
took
a
few
long
pulls
puffed
great
clouds
of
smoke
and
squaring
round
hands
on
his
knees
he
looked
at
madeline
with
piercing
intentness
his
hard
face
began
to
relax
and
soften
and
wrinkle
into
a
smile
wal

happier
man
in

world
than
bill
stillwell
last
of
the
old
madeline
thanked
the
rancher
and
then
rather
abruptly
retired
to
her
room
where
she
felt
no
restraint
to
hide
the
force
of
that
wonderful
idea
now
and
tenacious
and
alluring
upon
the
next
day
late
in
the
afternoon
she
asked
alfred
if
it
would
be
safe
for
her
to
ride
out
to
the
mesa
i
go
with
you
he
said
gaily
dear
fellow
i
want
to
go
alone
she
replied
ah
alfred
exclaimed
suddenly
serious
he
gave
her
just
a
quick
glance
then
turned
away
go
ahead
i
think
it
safe
i
make
it
safe
by
sitting
here
with
my
glass
and
keeping
an
eye
on
you
be
careful
coming
down
the
trail
let
the
horse
pick
his
way
that
she
rode
majesty
across
the
wide
flat
up
the
zigzag
trail
across
the
beautiful
grassy
level
to
the
far
rim
of
the
mesa
and
not
till
then
did
she
lift
her
eyes
to
face
the
southwest
madeline
looked
from
the
gray
valley
at
her
feet
to
the
blue
sierra
madres
in
the
setting
sun
her
vision
embraced
in
that
glance
distance
and
depth
and
glory
hitherto
unrevealed
to
her
the
gray
valley
sloped
and
widened
to
the
black
sentinel
chiricahuas
and
beyond
was
lost
in
a
vast
corrugated
sweep
of
earth
reddening
down
to
the
west
where
a
golden
blaze
lifted
the
dark
rugged
mountains
into
bold
relief
the
scene
had
infinite
beauty
but
after
madeline
first
swift
flash
of
enraptured
eyes
thought
of
beauty
passed
away
in
that
darkening
desert
there
was
something
illimitable
madeline
saw
the
hollow
of
a
stupendous
hand
she
felt
a
mighty
hold
upon
her
heart
out
of
the
endless
space
out
of
silence
and
desolation
and
mystery
and
age
came
colored
shadows
phantoms
of
peace
and
they
whispered
to
madeline
they
whispered
that
it
was
a
great
grim
immutable
earth
that
time
was
eternity
that
life
was
fleeting
they
whispered
for
her
to
be
a
woman
to
love
some
one
before
it
was
too
late
to
love
any
one
every
one
to
realize
the
need
of
work
and
in
doing
it
to
find
happiness
she
rode
back
across
the
mesa
and
down
the
trail
and
once
more
upon
the
flat
she
called
to
the
horse
and
made
him
run
his
spirit
seemed
to
race
with
hers
the
wind
of
his
speed
blew
her
hair
from
its
fastenings
when
he
thundered
to
a
halt
at
the
porch
steps
madeline
breathless
and
disheveled
alighted
with
the
mass
of
her
hair
tumbling
around
her
alfred
met
her
and
his
exclamation
and
florence
rapt
eyes
shining
on
her
face
and
stillwell
speechlessness
made
her
laughing
she
tried
to
put
up
the
mass
of
hair
i
must
look
a
fright
she
panted
wal
you
can
say
what
you
like
replied
the
old
cattleman
but
i
know
what
i
madeline
strove
to
attain
calmness
my
hat
and
my
combs
went
on
the
wind
i
thought
my
hair
would
go
too
there
is
the
evening
star
i
think
i
am
very
and
then
she
gave
up
trying
to
be
calm
and
likewise
to
fasten
up
her
hair
which
fell
again
in
a
golden
mass
mr
stillwell
she
began
and
paused
strangely
aware
of
a
hurried
note
a
deeper
ring
in
her
voice
mr
stillwell
i
want
to
buy
your
ranch
to
engage
you
as
my
superintendent
i
want
to
buy
don
ranch
and
other
property
to
the
extent
say
of
fifty
thousand
acres
i
want
you
to
buy
horses
and
cattle
in
short
to
make
all
those
improvements
which
you
said
you
had
so
long
dreamed
of
then
i
have
ideas
of
my
own
in
the
development
of
which
i
must
have
your
advice
and
alfred
i
intend
to
better
the
condition
of
those
poor
mexicans
in
the
valley
i
intend
to
make
life
a
little
more
worth
living
for
them
and
for
the
cowboys
of
this
range
we
shall
talk
it
all
over
plan
all
the
business
madeline
turned
from
the
huge
smile
that
beamed
down
upon
her
and
held
out
her
hands
to
her
brother
alfred
strange
is
it
not
my
coming
out
to
you
nay
do
smile
i
hope
i
have
found
myself
my
work
my
happiness
here
under
the
light
of
that
western
vii
her
majesty
rancho
five
months
brought
all
that
stillwell
had
dreamed
of
and
so
many
more
changes
and
improvements
and
innovations
that
it
was
as
if
a
magic
touch
had
transformed
the
old
ranch
madeline
and
alfred
and
florence
had
talked
over
a
fitting
name
and
had
decided
on
one
chosen
by
madeline
but
this
instance
was
the
only
one
in
the
course
of
developments
in
which
madeline
wishes
were
not
compiled
with
the
cowboys
named
the
new
ranch
her
majesty
stillwell
said
the
names
cowboys
bestowed
were
felicitous
and
as
unchangeable
as
the
everlasting
hills
florence
went
over
to
the
enemy
and
alfred
laughing
at
protest
declared
the
cowboys
had
elected
her
queen
of
the
ranges
and
that
there
was
no
help
for
it
so
the
name
stood
her
majesty
the
april
sun
shone
down
upon
a
green
knoll
that
nestled
in
the
lee
of
the
foothills
and
seemed
to
center
bright
rays
upon
the
long
which
gleamed
from
the
level
summit
the
grounds
around
the
house
bore
no
semblance
to
eastern
lawns
or
parks
there
had
been
no
stillwell
had
just
brought
water
and
grass
and
flowers
and
plants
to
the
and
there
had
left
them
as
it
were
to
follow
nature
his
idea
may
have
been
crude
but
the
result
was
beautiful
under
that
hot
sun
and
balmy
air
with
cool
water
daily
soaking
into
the
rich
soil
a
green
covering
sprang
into
life
and
everywhere
upon
it
as
if
by
magic
many
colored
flowers
rose
in
the
sweet
air
pale
wild
flowers
lavender
daisies
fragile
bluebells
white
lilies
like
eastern
mayflowers
and
golden
poppies

and
trembled
with
the
weight
of

down
in

the
full
power
of
the
sun
blazed
the
vermilion
and
magenta
blossoms
of
cactus
plants
green
slopes
led
all
the
way
down
to
where
new
adobe
barns
and
sheds
had
been
erected
and
wide
corrals
stretched
fences
down
to
the
great
squares
of
alfalfa
gently
inclining
to
the
gray
of
the
valley
the
bottom
of
a
hollow
shone
brightly
with
its
slowly
increasing
acreage
of
water
upon
which
thousands
of
migratory
wildfowl
whirred
and
splashed
and
squawked
as
if
reluctant
to
leave
this
cool
wet
surprise
so
new
in
the
long
desert
journey
to
the
northland
quarters
for
the
cowboys

not
even
the
lamest
cowboy
dared
describe

stood
in
a
row
upon
a
long
bench
of
ground
above
the
lake
and
down
to
the
edge
of
the
valley
the
cluster
of
mexican
habitations
and
the
little
church
showed
the
touch
of
the
same
renewing
hand
all
that
had
been
left
of
the
old
spanish
house
which
had
been
stillwell
home
for
so
long
was
the
bare
massive
structure
and
some
of
this
had
been
cut
away
for
new
doors
and
windows
every
modern
convenience
even
to
hot
and
cold
running
water
and
acetylene
light
had
been
installed
and
the
whole
interior
painted
and
carpentered
and
furnished
the
ideal
sought
had
not
been
luxury
but
comfort
every
door
into
the
patio
looked
out
upon
dark
rich
grass
and
flowers
and
every
window
looked
down
the
green
slopes
madeline
rooms
occupied
the
west
end
of
the
building
and
comprised
four
in
number
all
opening
out
upon
the
long
porch
there
was
a
small
room
for
her
maid
another
which
she
used
as
an
office
then
her
and
lastly
the
great
light
chamber
which
she
had
liked
so
well
upon
first
sight
and
which
now
simply
yet
beautifully
furnished
and
containing
her
favorite
books
and
pictures
she
had
come
to
love
as
she
had
never
loved
any
room
at
home
in
the
morning
the
fragrant
balmy
air
blew
the
white
curtains
of
the
open
windows
at
noon
the
drowsy
sultry
quiet
seemed
to
creep
in
for
the
siesta
that
was
characteristic
of
the
country
in
the
afternoon
the
westering
sun
peeped
under
the
porch
roof
and
painted
the
walls
with
gold
bars
that
slowly
changed
to
red
madeline
hammond
cherished
a
fancy
that
the
transformation
she
had
wrought
in
the
old
spanish
house
and
in
the
people
with
whom
she
had
surrounded
herself
great
as
that
transformation
had
been
was
as
nothing
compared
to
the
one
wrought
in
herself
she
had
found
an
object
in
life
she
was
busy
she
worked
with
her
hands
as
well
as
mind
yet
she
seemed
to
have
more
time
to
read
and
think
and
study
and
idle
and
dream
than
ever
before
she
had
seen
her
brother
through
his
difficulties
on
the
road
to
all
the
success
and
prosperity
that
he
cared
for
madeline
had
been
a
conscientious
student
of
ranching
and
an
apt
pupil
of
stillwell
the
old
cattleman
in
his
simplicity
gave
her
the
place
in
his
heart
that
was
meant
for
the
daughter
he
had
never
had
his
pride
in
her
madeline
thought
was
beyond
reason
or
belief
or
words
to
tell
under
his
guidance
sometimes
accompanied
by
alfred
and
florence
madeline
had
ridden
the
ranges
and
had
studied
the
life
and
work
of
the
cowboys
she
had
camped
on
the
open
range
slept
under
the
blinking
stars
ridden
forty
miles
a
day
in
the
face
of
dust
and
wind
she
had
taken
two
wonderful
trips
down
into
the
desert
one
trip
to
chiricahua
and
from
there
across
the
waste
of
sand
and
rock
and
alkali
and
cactus
to
the
mexican
borderline
and
the
other
through
the
aravaipa
valley
with
its
deep
canyons
and
wild
fastnesses
this
this
training
into
western
ways
though
she
had
been
a
outdoor
girl
had
required
great
effort
and
severe
pain
but
the
education
now
past
its
grades
had
become
a
labor
of
love
she
had
perfect
health
abounding
spirits
she
was
so
active
hat
she
had
to
train
herself
into
taking
the
midday
siesta
a
custom
of
the
country
and
imperative
during
the
hot
summer
months
sometimes
she
looked
in
her
mirror
and
laughed
with
sheer
joy
at
sight
of
the
lithe
audacious
creature
reflected
there
it
was
not
so
much
joy
in
her
beauty
as
sheer
joy
of
life
eastern
critics
had
been
wont
to
call
her
beautiful
in
those
days
when
she
had
been
pale
and
slender
and
proud
and
cold
she
laughed
if
they
could
only
see
her
now
from
the
tip
of
her
golden
head
to
her
feet
she
was
alive
pulsating
on
fire
sometimes
she
thought
of
her
parents
sister
friends
of
how
they
had
persistently
refused
to
believe
she
could
or
would
stay
in
the
west
they
were
always
asking
her
to
come
home
and
when
she
wrote
which
was
dutifully
often
the
last
thing
under
the
sun
that
she
was
likely
to
mention
was
the
change
in
her
she
wrote
that
she
would
return
to
her
old
home
some
time
of
course
for
a
visit
and
letters
such
as
this
brought
returns
that
amused
madeline
sometimes
saddened
her
she
meant
to
go
back
east
for
a
while
and
after
that
once
or
twice
every
year
but
the
initiative
was
a
difficult
step
from
which
she
shrank
once
home
she
would
have
to
make
explanations
and
these
would
not
be
understood
her
father
business
had
been
such
that
he
could
not
leave
it
for
the
time
required
for
a
western
trip
or
else
according
to
his
letter
he
would
have
come
for
her
hammond
could
not
have
been
driven
to
cross
the
hudson
river
her
idea
of
the
wilderness
westward
was
that
indians
still
chased
buffalo
on
the
outskirts
of
chicago
madeline
sister
helen
had
long
been
eager
to
come
as
much
from
curiosity
madeline
thought
as
from
sisterly
regard
and
at
length
madeline
concluded
that
the
proof
of
her
breaking
permanent
ties
might
better
be
seen
by
visiting
relatives
and
friends
before
she
went
back
east
with
that
in
mind
she
invited
helen
to
visit
her
during
the
summer
and
bring
as
many
friends
as
she
liked
no
slight
task
indeed
was
it
to
oversee
the
many
business
details
of
her
majesty
rancho
and
to
keep
a
record
of
them
madeline
found
the
course
of
business
training
upon
which
her
father
had
insisted
to
be
invaluable
to
her
now
it
helped
her
to
assimilate
and
arrange
the
practical
details
of
as
put
forth
by
the
blunt
stillwell
she
split
up
the
great
stock
of
cattle
into
different
herds
and
when
any
of
these
were
out
running
upon
the
open
range
she
had
them
closely
watched
part
of
the
time
each
herd
was
kept
in
an
inclosed
range
fed
and
watered
and
carefully
handled
by
a
big
force
of
cowboys
she
employed
three
cowboy
scouts
whose
sole
duty
was
to
ride
the
ranges
searching
for
stray
sick
or
crippled
cattle
or
motherless
calves
and
to
bring
these
in
to
be
treated
and
nursed
there
were
two
cowboys
whose
business
was
to
master
a
pack
of
russian
and
to
hunt
down
the
coyotes
wolves
and
lions
that
preyed
upon
the
herds
the
better
and
tamer
milch
cows
were
separated
from
the
ranging
herds
and
kept
in
a
pasture
adjoining
the
dairy
all
branding
was
done
in
corrals
and
calves
were
weaned
from
at
the
proper
time
to
benefit
both
the
old
method
of
branding
and
classing
that
had
so
shocked
madeline
had
been
abandoned
and
one
had
been
inaugurated
whereby
cattle
and
cowboys
and
horses
were
spared
brutality
and
injury
madeline
established
an
extensive
vegetable
farm
and
she
planted
orchards
the
climate
was
superior
to
that
of
california
and
with
abundant
water
trees
and
plants
and
gardens
flourished
and
bloomed
in
a
way
wonderful
to
behold
it
was
with
pleasure
that
madeline
walked
through
acres
of
ground
once
bare
now
green
and
bright
and
fragrant
there
were
and
and
marshy
quarters
for
ducks
and
geese
here
in
the
farming
section
of
the
ranch
madeline
found
employment
for
the
little
colony
of
mexicans
their
lives
had
been
as
hard
and
barren
as
the
dry
valley
where
they
had
lived
but
as
the
valley
had
been
transformed
by
the
soft
rich
touch
of
water
so
their
lives
had
been
transformed
by
help
and
sympathy
and
work
the
children
were
wretched
no
more
and
many
that
had
been
blind
could
now
see
and
madeline
had
become
to
them
a
new
and
blessed
virgin
madeline
looked
abroad
over
these
lands
and
likened
the
change
in
them
and
those
who
lived
by
them
to
the
change
in
her
heart
it
may
have
been
fancy
but
the
sun
seemed
to
be
brighter
the
sky
bluer
the
wind
sweeter
certain
it
was
that
the
deep
green
of
grass
and
garden
was
not
fancy
nor
the
white
and
pink
of
blossom
nor
the
blaze
and
perfume
of
flower
nor
the
sheen
of
lake
and
the
fluttering
of
leaves
where
there
had
been
monotonous
gray
there
was
now
vivid
and
changing
color
formerly
there
had
been
silence
both
day
and
night
now
during
the
sunny
hours
there
was
music
the
whistle
of
prancing
stallions
pealed
in
from
the
grassy
ridges
innumerable
birds
had
come
and
like
the
ducks
they
had
tarried
to
stay
the
song
of
and
blackbird
and
robin
familiar
to
madeline
from
childhood
mingled
with
the
new
and
strange
song
of
and
the
piercing
blast
of
the
desert
eagle
and
the
melancholy
moan
of
one
april
morning
madeline
sat
in
her
office
wrestling
with
a
problem
she
had
problems
to
solve
every
day
the
majority
of
these
were
concerned
with
the
management
of
incomprehensible
cowboys
this
particular
problem
involved
ambrose
mills
who
had
eloped
with
her
french
maid
christine
stillwell
faced
madeline
with
a
smile
almost
as
huge
as
his
bulk
wal
miss

ketched
them
but
not
before
padre
marcos

i
never

so
surprised
in
my
life
christine
did
not
seem
to
care
any
more
for
ambrose
than
for
any
of
the
other
cowboys
what
does
my
authority
amount
to
i
must
do
something
stillwell
you
must
help
whenever
madeline
fell
into
a
quandary
she
had
to
call
upon
the
old
cattleman
no
man
ever
held
a
position
with
greater
pride
than
stillwell
but
he
had
been
put
to
tests
that
steeped
him
in
humility
here
he
scratched
his
head
in
great
perplexity
the
luck
what
this
elopin
bizness

do
with
i
do
know
nothin

boys
fer
a
very
well
stillwell
bring
ambrose
in
to
see
me
and
tell
christine
to
wait
in
my
it
was
a
handsome
debonair
cowboy
that
came
tramping
into
madeline
presence
his
accustomed
shyness
and
awkwardness
had
disappeared
in
an
excited
manner
he
was
a
happy
boy
he
looked
straight
into
madeline
face
as
if
he
expected
her
to
wish
him
joy
and
madeline
actually
found
that
expression
trembling
to
her
lips
she
held
it
back
until
she
could
be
severe
but
madeline
feared
she
would
fail
of
much
severity
something
warm
and
sweet
like
a
fragrance
had
entered
the
room
with
ambrose
ambrose
what
have
you
done
she
asked
miss
hammond
i
been
and
gone
and
got
married
replied
ambrose
his
words
tumbling
over
one
another
his
eyes
snapped
and
there
was
a
kind
of
glow
upon
his
brown
cheek
i
stole
a
march
on
the
other
boys
there
was
frank
slade
pushin
me
close
and
i
was
some
runnin
to
keep
jim
bell
back
in
my
dust
even
old
man
nels
made
eyes
at
christine
so
i
was
goin
to
take
any
chances
i
just
packed
her
off
to
el
cajon
and
married
oh
so
i
heard
said
madeline
slowly
as
she
watched
him
ambrose
do
you
love
her
he
reddened
under
her
clear
gaze
dropped
his
head
and
fumbled
with
his
new
sombrero
and
there
was
a
catch
in
his
breath
madeline
saw
his
powerful
brown
hand
tremble
it
affected
her
strangely
that
this
stalwart
cowboy
who
could
rope
and
throw
and
tie
a
wild
steer
in
less
than
one
minute
should
tremble
at
a
mere
question
suddenly
he
raised
his
head
and
at
the
beautiful
blase
of
his
eyes
madeline
turned
her
own
away
yes
miss
hammond
i
love
her
he
said
i
think
i
love
her
in
the
way
you
askin
about
i
know
the
first
time
i
saw
her
i
thought
how
wonderful
it
be
to
have
a
girl
like
that
for
my
wife
it
all
been
so
strange
her
comin
an
how
she
made
me
feel
sure
i
never
knew
many
girls
and
i
have
seen
any
girls
at
all
for
years
but
when
she
came
a
girl
makes
a
wonderful
difference
in
a
man
feelin
and
thoughts
i
guess
i
never
had
any
before
leastways
none
like
i
have
now
my
it
well
i
guess
i
have
a
little
understandin
now
of
padre
marcos
ambrose
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
asked
madeline
i
sure
sorry
i
did
have
time
to
tell
you
but
i
was
in
some
what
did
you
intend
to
do
where
were
you
going
when
stillwell
found
you
we
just
been
married
i
had
thought
of
anything
after
that
suppose
i
have
rustled
back
to
my
job
i
sure
have
to
work
now
and
save
my
oh
well
ambrose
i
am
glad
you
realize
your
responsibilities
do
you
earn
enough
is
your
pay
sufficient
to
keep
a
wife
sure
it
is
why
miss
hammond
i
never
before
earned
half
the
salary
i
gettin
now
it
some
fine
to
work
for
you
i
goin
to
fire
the
boys
out
of
my
and
fix
it
up
for
christine
and
me
say
they
be
jealous
ambrose
i
i
congratulate
you
i
wish
you
joy
said
madeline
i
i
shall
make
christine
a
little
i
want
to
talk
to
her
for
a
few
moments
you
may
go
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
madeline
to
say
one
severe
word
to
that
happy
cowboy
she
experienced
difficulty
in
hiding
her
own
happiness
at
the
turn
of
events
curiosity
and
interest
mingled
with
her
pleasure
when
she
called
to
christine
mrs
ambrose
mills
please
come
no
sound
came
from
the
other
room
i
should
like
very
much
to
see
the
bride
went
on
madeline
still
there
was
no
stir
or
reply
christine
called
madeline
then
it
was
as
if
a
little
whirlwind
of
flying
feet
and
entreating
hands
and
beseeching
eyes
blew
in
upon
madeline
christine
was
small
graceful
plump
with
very
white
skin
and
very
dark
hair
she
had
been
madeline
favorite
maid
for
years
and
there
was
sincere
affection
between
the
two
whatever
had
been
the
blissful
ignorance
of
ambrose
it
was
manifestly
certain
that
christine
knew
how
she
had
transgressed
her
fear
and
remorse
and
appeal
for
forgiveness
were
poured
out
in
an
incoherent
storm
plain
it
was
that
the
little
french
maid
had
been
overwhelmed
it
was
only
after
madeline
had
taken
the
emotional
girl
in
her
arms
and
had
forgiven
and
soothed
her
that
her
part
in
the
elopement
became
clear
christine
was
in
a
maze
but
gradually
as
she
talked
and
saw
that
she
was
forgiven
calmness
came
in
some
degree
and
with
it
a
story
which
amused
yet
shocked
madeline
the
unmistakable
shy
marveling
love
scarcely
realized
by
christine
gave
madeline
relief
and
joy
if
christine
loved
ambrose
there
was
no
harm
done
watching
the
girl
eyes
wonderful
with
their
changes
of
thought
listening
to
her
attempts
to
explain
what
it
was
evident
she
did
not
understand
madeline
gathered
that
if
ever
a
caveman
had
taken
unto
himself
a
wife
if
ever
a
barbarian
had
carried
off
a
sabine
woman
then
ambrose
mills
had
acted
with
the
violence
of
such
ancient
forebears
just
how
it
all
happened
seemed
to
be
beyond
christine
he
say
he
love
me
repeated
the
girl
in
a
kind
of
rapt
awe
he
ask
me
to
marry
him
he
kees
me
he
hug
me
he
lift
me
on
ze
horse
he
ride
with
me
all
night
he
marry
and
she
exhibited
a
ring
on
the
third
finger
of
her
left
hand
madeline
saw
that
whatever
had
been
the
state
of
christine
feeling
for
ambrose
before
this
marriage
she
loved
him
now
she
had
been
taken
forcibly
but
she
was
won
after
christine
had
gone
comforted
and
betraying
her
shy
eagerness
to
get
back
to
ambrose
madeline
was
haunted
by
the
look
in
the
eyes
and
her
words
assuredly
the
spell
of
romance
was
on
this
sunny
land
for
madeline
there
was
a
nameless
charm
a
nameless
thrill
combating
her
sense
of
the
violence
and
unfitness
of
ambrose
wooing
something
she
knew
not
what
took
arms
against
her
intellectual
arraignment
of
the
cowboy
method
of
getting
himself
a
wife
he
had
said
straight
out
that
he
loved
the
girl
he
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
he
kissed
her
he
hugged
her
he
lifted
her
upon
his
horse
he
rode
away
with
her
through
the
night
and
he
married
her
in
whatever
light
madeline
reviewed
this
thing
she
always
came
back
to
her
first
natural
impression
it
thrilled
her
charmed
her
it
went
against
all
the
precepts
of
her
training
nevertheless
it
was
somehow
splendid
and
beautiful
she
imagined
it
stripped
another
artificial
scale
from
her
eyes
scarcely
had
she
settled
again
to
the
task
on
her
desk
when
heavy
tread
across
the
porch
interrupted
her
this
time
when
he
entered
he
wore
a
look
that
bordered
upon
the
hysterical
it
was
difficult
to
tell
whether
he
was
trying
to
suppress
grief
or
glee
miss
majesty
there
another
amazin
strange
thing
sprung
on
me
hyars
jim
bell
come
to
see
you
an
when
i
taxed
him
sayin
you
was
tolerable
busy
he
up
an
says
he
was
hungry
an
he
ai
to
eat
any
more
bread
made
in
a
says
he
starve
first
says
nels
hed
the
gang
over
to
big
bunk
an
feasted
them
on
bread
you
taught
him
how
to
make
in
some
with
a
crank
jim
says
thet
bread
beat
any
cake
he
ever
eat
an
he
wants
you
to
show
him
how
to
make
some
now
miss
majesty
as
superintendent
of
this
ranch
i
ought
to
know
what
goin
on
mebbe
jim
is
jest
me
mebbe
he
gone
clean
dotty
mebbe
i
hev
an
beggin
your
pardon
i
want
to
know
if
there
any
truth
in
what
jim
says
nels
whereupon
it
became
necessary
for
madeline
to
stifle
her
mirth
and
to
inform
the
sadly
perplexed
old
cattleman
that
she
had
received
from
the
east
a
patent
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
her
household
women
had
taken
fright
at
the
contrivance
she
had
essayed
to
operate
it
herself
this
had
turned
out
to
be
so
simple
so
saving
of
time
and
energy
and
flour
so
much
more
cleanly
than
the
old
method
of
mixing
dough
with
the
hands
and
particularly
it
had
resulted
in
such
good
bread
that
madeline
had
been
pleased
immediately
she
ordered
more
of
the
one
day
she
had
happened
upon
nels
making
biscuit
dough
in
his
and
she
had
delicately
and
considerately
introduced
to
him
the
idea
of
her
new
method
nels
it
appeared
had
a
great
reputation
as
a
and
he
was
proud
of
it
moreover
he
was
skeptical
of
any
thing
with
wheels
and
cranks
he
consented
however
to
let
her
show
how
the
thing
worked
and
to
sample
some
of
the
bread
to
that
end
she
had
him
come
up
to
the
house
where
she
won
him
over
stillwell
laughed
loud
and
long
wal
wal
wal
he
exclaimed
at
length
thet
fine
an
powerful
funny
mebbe
you
do
see
how
funny
wal
nels
has
jest
been
lordin
it
over
the
boys
about
how
you
showed
him
an
now
you

every
last
cowboy
on

place
the
same
thing

the
jealousest
kind
of
fellers
they

about
you
anyway
take
jim
out
hyar
why
thet
lazy
cowpuncher
jest
never
would
make
bread
he
notorious
fer
shirkin
his
share
of
the
grub
deal
i
knowed
jim
to
trade
off
washin
the
pots
an
pans
fer
a
lonely
watch
on
a
rainy
night
all
he
wants
is
to
see
you
show
him
the
same
as
nels
is
over
then
he
crow
over
his
bunkie
frank
slade
an
then
get
lonely
to
know
all
about
this
wonderful
cowboys
are
amazin
strange
critters
miss
majesty
an
now
thet
you
begun
with
them
this
way
you
hev
to
keep
it
up
i
will
say
i
never
seen
such
a
bunch
to
work
you
sure
put
heart
in
indeed
stillwell
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
replied
madeline
and
i
shall
be
pleased
to
teach

rejoined
stillwell
dryly
what

miss
majesty
is
to
let
come
one
by
one
an
make
each
cowboy
think

more
especial
pleasure
in
showin
him
than
the
feller
who
came
before
him
then
mebbe
we
can
go
on
with
madeline
protested
and
stillwell
held
inexorably
to
what
he
said
was
wisdom
several
times
madeline
had
gone
against
his
advice
to
her
utter
discomfiture
and
rout
she
dared
not
risk
it
again
and
resigned
herself
gracefully
and
with
subdued
merriment
to
her
task
jim
bell
was
ushered
into
the
great
light
spotless
kitchen
where
presently
madeline
appeared
to
put
on
an
apron
and
roll
up
her
sleeves
she
explained
the
use
of
the
several
pieces
of
aluminum
that
made
up
the
and
fastened
the
bucket
to
the
jim
life
might
have
depended
upon
this
lesson
judging
from
his
absorbed
manner
and
his
desire
to
have
things
explained
over
and
over
especially
the
turning
of
the
crank
when
madeline
had
to
take
jim
hand
three
times
to
show
him
the
simple
mechanism
and
then
he
did
not
understand
she
began
to
have
faint
misgivings
as
to
his
absolute
sincerity
she
guessed
that
as
long
as
she
touched
jim
hand
he
never
would
understand
then
as
she
began
to
measure
out
flour
and
milk
and
lard
and
salt
and
yeast
she
saw
with
despair
that
jim
was
not
looking
at
the
ingredients
was
not
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
them
his
eyes
were
covertly
upon
her
jim
i
am
not
sure
about
you
said
madeline
severely
how
can
you
learn
to
make
bread
if
you
do
not
watch
me
mix
it
i
am
you
replied
jim
innocently
finally
madeline
sent
the
cowboy
on
his
way
rejoicing
with
the
under
his
arm
next
morning
true
to
stillwell
prophecy
frank
slade
jim
bunkmate
presented
himself
cheerfully
to
madeline
and
unbosomed
himself
of
a
and
persistent
desire
to
relieve
his
overworked
comrade
of
some
of
the
in
their
bunk
miss
hammond
said
frank
jim
orful
kind
wantin
to
do
it
all
hisself
but
he
ai
very
bright
an
i
did
believe
him
you
see
i
from
missouri
an
you
have
to
show
for
a
whole
week
madeline
held
clinics
where
she
expounded
the
scientific
method
of
modern
she
got
a
good
deal
of
enjoyment
out
of
her
lectures
what
boys
these
great
hulking
fellows
were
she
saw
through
their
simple
ruses
some
of
them
were
grave
as
deacons
others
wore
expressions
important
enough
to
have
fitted
the
faces
of
statesmen
signing
government
treaties
these
cowboys
were
children
they
needed
to
be
governed
but
in
order
to
govern
them
they
had
to
be
humored
a
more
crowd
of
boys
could
not
have
been
found
and
they
were
grown
men
stillwell
explained
that
the
exuberance
of
spirits
lay
in
the
difference
in
their
fortunes
cowboys
in
relays
of
nine
worked
eight
hours
a
day
that
had
never
been
heard
of
before
in
the
west
stillwell
declared
that
cowboys
from
all
points
of
the
compass
would
head
their
horses
toward
her
majesty
rancho
viii
el
capitan
stillwell
interest
in
the
revolution
across
the
mexican
line
had
manifestly
increased
with
the
news
that
gene
stewart
had
achieved
distinction
with
the
rebel
forces
thereafter
the
old
cattleman
sent
for
el
paso
and
douglas
newspapers
wrote
to
ranchmen
he
knew
on
the
big
bend
of
the
rio
grande
and
he
would
talk
indefinitely
to
any
one
who
would
listen
to
him
there
was
not
any
possibility
of
friends
at
the
ranch
forgetting
his
favorite
cowboy
stillwell
always
prefaced
his
eulogy
with
an
apologetic
statement
that
stewart
had
gone
to
the
bad
madeline
liked
to
listen
to
him
though
she
was
not
always
sure
which
news
was
authentic
and
which
imagination
there
appeared
to
be
no
doubt
however
that
the
cowboy
had
performed
some
daring
feats
for
the
rebels
madeline
found
his
name
mentioned
in
several
of
the
border
papers
when
the
rebels
under
madero
stormed
and
captured
the
city
of
juarez
stewart
did
fighting
that
won
him
the
name
of
el
capitan
this
battle
apparently
ended
the
revolution
the
capitulation
of
president
diaz
followed
shortly
and
there
was
a
feeling
of
relief
among
ranchers
on
the
border
from
texas
to
california
nothing
more
was
heard
of
gene
stewart
until
april
when
a
report
reached
stillwell
that
the
cowboy
had
arrived
in
el
cajon
evidently
hunting
trouble
the
old
cattleman
saddled
a
horse
and
started
for
town
in
two
days
he
returned
depressed
in
spirit
madeline
happened
to
be
present
when
stillwell
talked
to
alfred
i
got
there
too
late
al
said
the
cattleman
gene
was
gone
an
what
do
you
think
of
this
danny
mains
hed
jest
left
with
a
couple
of
burros
packed
i
could
find
what
way
he
went
but
i
bettin
he
hit
the
peloncillo
danny
will
show
up
some
day
replied
alfred
what
did
you
learn
about
stewart
maybe
he
left
with
not
much
said
stillwell
shortly
gene
fer
election
no
mountains
fer
well
tell
us
about
stillwell
wiped
his
sweaty
brow
and
squared
himself
to
talk
wal
it
sure
amazin
strange
about
gene
its
got
me
locoed
he
arrived
in
el
cajon
a
week
or
so
ago
he
was
trained
down
like
as
if
he
been
ridin
the
range
all
winter
he
hed
plenty
of
money
mex
they
said
an
all
the
greasers
was
crazy
about
him
called
him
el
capitan
he
got
drunk
an
went
roarin
round
fer
pat
hawe
you
remember
that
greaser
who
was
plugged
last
october
the
night
miss
majesty
arrived
wal
he
daid
he
daid
an
people
says
thet
pat
is
to
lay
thet
killin
onto
gene
i
reckon
thet
jest
talk
though
pat
is
mean
enough
to
do
it
if
he
hed
the
nerve
anyway
if
he
was
in
el
cajon
he
kept
mighty
much
to
hisself
gene
walked
up
an
down
up
an
down
all
day
an
night
lookin
fer
pat
but
he
did
find
him
an
of
course
he
kept
gettin
drunker
he
jest
got
plumb
bad
he
made
lots
of
trouble
but
there
was
no
mebbe
thet
made
him
sore
so
he
went
licked
flo
thet
was
so
bad
jack
sure
needed
a
good
lickin
wal
then
gene
met
danny
an
tried
to
get
danny
drunk
he
could
what
do
you
think
of
that
danny
hed
been
drinkin
would
touch
a
drop
i
sure
glad
of
thet
but
it
strange
why
danny
was
a
fish
fer
red
liquor
i
guess
he
an
gene
had
some
pretty
hard
words
though
i
not
sure
about
thet
anyway
gene
went
down
to
the
railroad
an
he
got
on
an
engine
an
he
was
in
the
engine
when
it
pulled
out
lord
i
hope
he
does
hold
up
the
train
if
he
gets
gay
over
in
arizona
he
go
to
the
pen
at
yuma
an
thet
pen
is
a
graveyard
fer

i
wired
to

along
the
railroad

an
to
wire

to
me
if
he
suppose

inquired
alfred
the
old
man
nodded
gloomily
i
straightened
him
up
once
mebbe
i
can
do
it
then
brightening
somewhat
he
turned
to
madeline
i
jest

one
of
the
bands
of
guerrillas
thet
are
harassin
the
border
this
revolution
ai
over
yet
it
jest
commenced
an
all
these
gangs
of
outlaws
are
goin
to
take
advantage
of
it
we
see
some
old
times
mebbe
wal
i
need
gene
stewart
i
need
him
bad
will
you
let
me
hire

majesty
if
i

straightened

the
old
cattleman
ended
huskily
stillwell
by
all
means
find
stewart
and
do
not
wait
to
straighten
him
up
bring
him
to
the
ranch
replied
madeline
thanking
her
stillwell
led
his
horse
away
strange
how
he
loves
that
cowboy
murmured
madeline
not
so
strange
majesty
replied
her
brother
not
when
you
know
stewart
has
been
with
stillwell
on
some
hard
trips
into
the
desert
alone
there
no
middle
course
of
feeling
between
men
facing
death
in
the
desert
either
they
hate
each
other
or
love
each
other
i
know
but
i
imagine
stewart
did
something
for
stillwell
saved
us
life
perhaps
besides
stewart
a
lovable
chap
when
he
going
straight
i
hope
stillwell
brings
him
back
we
do
need
him
majesty
he
a
born
leader
once
i
saw
him
ride
into
a
bunch
of
mexicans
whom
we
suspected
of
rustling
it
was
fine
to
see
him
well
i
sorry
to
tell
you
that
we
are
worried
about
don
carlos
some
of
his
vaqueros
came
into
my
yard
the
other
day
when
i
had
left
flo
alone
she
had
a
bad
scare
these
vaqueros
have
been
different
since
don
carlos
sold
the
ranch
for
that
matter
i
never
would
have
trusted
a
white
woman
alone
with
them
but
they
are
bolder
now
something
in
the
wind
they
got
assurance
they
can
ride
off
any
night
and
cross
the
during
the
succeeding
week
madeline
discovered
that
a
good
deal
of
her
sympathy
for
stillwell
in
his
hunt
for
the
reckless
stewart
had
insensibly
grown
to
be
sympathy
for
the
cowboy
it
was
rather
a
paradox
she
thought
that
opposed
to
the
continual
reports
of
stewart
wildness
as
he
caroused
from
town
to
town
were
the
continual
expressions
of
good
will
and
faith
and
hope
universally
given
out
by
those
near
her
at
the
ranch
stillwell
loved
the
cowboy
florence
was
fond
of
him
alfred
liked
and
admired
him
pitied
him
the
cowboys
swore
their
regard
for
him
the
more
he
disgraced
himself
the
mexicans
called
him
el
gran
capitan
madeline
personal
opinion
of
stewart
had
not
changed
in
the
least
since
the
night
it
had
been
formed
but
certain
attributes
of
his
not
clearly
defined
in
her
mind
and
the
gift
of
his
beautiful
horse
his
valor
with
the
fighting
rebels
and
all
this
strange
regard
for
him
especially
that
of
her
brother
made
her
exceedingly
regret
the
present
behavior
meanwhile
stillwell
was
so
earnest
and
zealous
that
one
not
familiar
with
the
situation
would
have
believed
he
was
trying
to
find
and
reclaim
his
own
son
he
made
several
trips
to
little
stations
in
the
valley
and
from
these
he
returned
with
a
gloomy
face
madeline
got
the
details
from
alfred
stewart
was
going
from
bad
to
worse
drunk
disorderly
savage
sure
to
land
in
the
penitentiary
then
came
a
report
that
hurried
stillwell
off
to
rodeo
he
returned
on
the
third
day
a
crushed
man
he
had
been
so
bitterly
hurt
that
no
one
not
even
madeline
could
get
out
of
him
what
had
happened
he
admitted
finding
stewart
failing
to
influence
him
and
when
the
old
cattleman
got
so
far
he
turned
purple
in
the
face
and
talked
to
himself
as
if
dazed
but
gene
was
drunk
he
was
drunk
or
he
could
hev
treated
old
bill
like
thet
madeline
was
stirred
with
an
anger
toward
the
brutal
cowboy
that
was
as
strong
as
her
sorrow
for
the
loyal
old
cattleman
and
it
was
when
stillwell
gave
up
that
she
resolved
to
take
a
hand
the
persistent
faith
of
stillwell
his
pathetic
excuses
in
the
face
of
what
must
have
been
stewart
violence
perhaps
baseness
actuated
her
powerfully
gave
her
new
insight
into
human
nature
she
honored
a
faith
that
remained
unshaken
and
the
strange
thought
came
to
her
that
stewart
must
somehow
be
worthy
of
such
a
faith
or
he
never
could
have
inspired
it
madeline
discovered
that
she
wanted
to
believe
that
somewhere
deep
down
in
the
most
depraved
and
sinful
wretch
upon
earth
there
was
some
grain
of
good
she
yearned
to
have
the
faith
in
human
nature
that
stillwell
had
in
stewart
she
sent
nels
mounted
upon
his
own
horse
and
leading
majesty
to
rodeo
in
search
of
stewart
nels
had
instructions
to
bring
stewart
back
to
the
ranch
in
due
time
nels
returned
leading
the
roan
without
a
rider
yep
i
shore
found
him
replied
nels
when
questioned
found
him
half
sobered
up
he
been
in
a
scrap
an
somebody
hed
put
him
to
sleep
i
guess
wal
when
he
seen
thet
roan
hoss
he
let
out
a
yell
an
grabbed
him
round
the
neck
the
hoss
knowed
him
all
right
then
gene
hugged
the
hoss
an
cried
cried
like
i
never
seen
no
one
who
cried
like
he
did
i
waited
awhile
an
was
jest
goin
to
say
somethin
to
him
when
he
turned
on
me
mad
as
fire
he
said
care
a
hell
of
a
lot
fer
thet
boss
an
i
liked
you
pretty
well
but
if
you
do
take
him
away
quick
i
shoot
you
both
wal
i
lit
out
i
did
even
git
to
say
howdy
to
nels
you
think
it
useless
any
attempt
to
see
him
persuade
him
asked
madeline
i
shore
do
miss
hammond
replied
nels
gravely
i
seen
a
few
an
locoed
an
an
in
my
day
but
gene
stewart
beats
all
he
shore
runnin
wild
fer
the
madeline
dismissed
nels
but
before
he
got
out
of
earshot
she
heard
him
speak
to
stillwell
who
awaited
him
on
the
porch
bill
put
this
in
your
pipe
an
smoke
it
none
of
them
scraps
gene
has
hed
was
over
a
woman
it
used
to
be
thet
when
he
was
drank
he
scrap
over
every
pretty
greaser
girl
he
run
across
thet
why
pat
hawe
thinks
gene
plugged
the
strange
vaquero
who
was
with
little
bonita
thet
night
last
fall
wal
gene
scrappin
now
jest
to
git
shot
up
hisself
for
some
reason
thet
only
god
almighty
nels
story
of
how
stewart
wept
over
his
horse
influenced
madeline
powerfully
her
next
move
was
to
persuade
alfred
to
see
if
he
could
not
do
better
with
this
doggedly
bent
cowboy
alfred
needed
only
a
word
of
persuasion
for
he
said
he
had
considered
going
to
rodeo
of
his
own
accord
he
went
and
returned
alone
majesty
i
ca
explain
stewart
singular
actions
said
alfred
i
saw
him
talked
with
him
he
knew
me
but
nothing
i
said
appeared
to
get
to
him
he
has
changed
terribly
i
fancy
his
once
magnificent
strength
is
breaking
it
it
actually
hurt
me
to
look
at
him
i
could
have
fetched
him
back
here
not
as
he
is
now
i
heard
all
about
him
and
if
he
is
downright
out
of
his
mind
he
as
bill
says
on
getting
killed
some
of
his
escapades
are
are
not
for
your
ears
bill
did
all
any
man
could
do
for
another
we
all
done
our
best
for
stewart
if
you
been
given
a
chance
perhaps
you
could
have
saved
him
but
it
too
late
put
it
out
of
mind
now
madeline
however
did
not
forget
nor
give
it
up
if
she
had
forgotten
or
surrendered
she
felt
that
she
would
have
been
relinquishing
infinitely
more
than
hope
to
aid
one
ruined
man
but
she
was
at
a
loss
to
know
what
further
steps
to
take
days
passed
and
each
one
brought
additional
gossip
of
stewart
headlong
career
toward
the
yuma
penitentiary
for
he
had
crossed
the
line
into
cochise
county
arizona
where
sheriffs
kept
a
stricter
observance
of
law
finally
a
letter
came
from
a
friend
of
nels
in
chiricahua
saying
that
stewart
had
been
hurt
in
a
brawl
there
his
hurt
was
not
serious
but
it
would
probably
keep
him
quiet
long
enough
to
get
sober
and
this
opportunity
informant
said
would
be
a
good
one
for
stewart
friends
to
take
him
home
before
he
got
locked
up
this
epistle
inclosed
a
letter
to
stewart
from
his
sister
evidently
it
had
been
found
upon
him
it
told
a
story
of
illness
and
made
an
appeal
for
aid
nels
friend
forwarded
this
letter
without
stewart
knowledge
thinking
stillwell
might
care
to
help
stewart
family
stewart
had
no
money
he
said
the
sister
letter
found
its
way
to
madeline
she
read
it
tears
in
her
eyes
it
told
madeline
much
more
than
its
brief
story
of
illness
and
poverty
and
wonder
why
gene
had
not
written
home
for
so
long
it
told
of
motherly
love
sisterly
love
brotherly
love
dear
family
ties
that
had
not
been
broken
it
spoke
of
pride
in
this
el
capitan
brother
who
had
become
famous
it
was
signed
your
loving
sister
not
improbably
madeline
revolved
in
mind
this
letter
was
one
reason
for
stewart
headstrong
abasement
it
had
been
received
too
late
after
he
had
squandered
the
money
that
would
have
meant
so
much
to
mother
and
sister
be
that
as
it
might
madeline
immediately
sent
a
to
stewart
sister
with
a
letter
explaining
that
the
money
was
drawn
in
advance
on
stewart
salary
this
done
she
impulsively
determined
to
go
to
chiricahua
herself
the
madeline
had
taken
to
this
little
arizona
hamlet
had
tried
her
endurance
to
the
utmost
but
the
journey
by
automobile
except
for
some
rocky
bits
of
road
and
sandy
stretches
was
comfortable
and
a
matter
of
only
a
few
hours
the
big
was
still
a
kind
of
seventh
wonder
to
the
mexicans
and
cowboys
not
that
automobiles
were
very
new
and
strange
but
because
this
one
was
such
an
enormous
machine
and
capable
of
greater
speed
than
an
the
chauffeur
who
had
arrived
with
the
car
found
his
situation
among
the
jealous
cowboys
somewhat
far
removed
from
a
bed
of
roses
he
had
been
induced
to
remain
long
enough
to
teach
the
operating
and
mechanical
technique
of
the
car
and
choice
fell
upon
link
stevens
for
the
simple
reason
that
of
all
the
cowboys
he
was
the
only
one
with
any
knack
for
mechanics
now
link
had
been
a
cowboy
and
that
winter
he
had
sustained
an
injury
to
his
leg
caused
by
a
bad
fall
and
was
unable
to
sit
his
horse
this
had
been
gall
and
wormwood
to
him
but
when
the
big
white
automobile
came
and
he
was
elected
to
drive
it
life
was
once
more
worth
living
for
him
but
all
the
other
cowboys
regarded
link
and
his
machine
as
some
correlated
species
of
demon
they
were
deathly
afraid
of
both
it
was
for
this
reason
that
nels
when
madeline
asked
him
to
accompany
her
to
chiricahua
replied
reluctantly
that
he
would
rather
follow
on
his
horse
however
she
prevailed
over
his
hesitancy
and
with
florence
also
in
the
car
they
set
out
for
miles
and
miles
the
valley
road
was
smooth
and
slightly
downhill
and
when
speeding
was
perfectly
safe
madeline
was
not
averse
to
it
the
grassy
plain
sailed
backward
in
gray
sheets
and
the
little
dot
in
the
valley
grew
larger
and
larger
from
time
to
time
link
glanced
round
at
unhappy
nels
whose
eyes
were
wild
and
whose
hands
clutched
his
seat
while
the
car
was
crossing
the
sandy
and
rocky
places
going
slowly
nels
appeared
to
breathe
easier
and
when
it
stopped
in
the
wide
dusty
street
of
chiricahua
nels
gladly
tumbled
out
nels
we
shall
wait
here
in
the
car
while
you
find
stewart
said
madeline
miss
hammond
i
reckon
gene
run
when
he
sees
us
if
he
able
to
run
replied
nels
wal
i
go
find
him
an
make
up
my
mind
then
what
we
better
nels
crossed
the
railroad
track
and
disappeared
behind
the
low
flat
houses
after
a
little
time
he
reappeared
and
hurried
up
to
the
car
madeline
felt
his
gray
gaze
searching
her
face
miss
hammond
i
found
him
said
nels
he
was
sleepin
i
woke
him
he
sober
an
not
bad
hurt
but
i
do
believe
you
ought
to
see
him
mebbe
florence
nels
i
want
to
see
him
myself
why
not
what
did
he
say
when
you
told
him
i
was
here
shore
i
did
tell
him
that
i
jest
says
gene
an
he
says
gawd
nels
mebbe
i
ai
glad
to
see
a
human
bein
he
asked
me
who
was
with
me
an
i
told
him
link
an
some
friends
i
said
i
fetch
them
in
he
hollered
at
thet
but
i
went
anyway
now
if
you
really
will
see
him
miss
hammond
it
a
good
chance
but
shore
it
a
touchy
matter
an
you
be
some
sick
at
sight
of
him
he
layin
in
a
greaser
hole
over
here
likely
the
greasers
hev
been
kind
to
him
but
they
shore
a
poor
madeline
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
thank
you
nels
take
me
at
once
come
they
left
the
car
now
surrounded
by
mexican
children
and
crossed
the
dusty
space
to
a
narrow
lane
between
red
adobe
walls
passing
by
several
houses
nels
stopped
at
the
door
of
what
appeared
to
be
an
alleyway
leading
back
it
was
filthy
he
in
there
around
thet
first
corner
it
a
patio
open
an
sunny
an
miss
hammond
if
you
do
mind
i
wait
here
for
you
i
reckon
gene
would
like
any
fellers
around
when
he
sees
you
it
was
that
which
made
madeline
hesitate
then
and
go
forward
slowly
she
had
given
no
thought
at
all
to
what
stewart
might
feel
when
suddenly
surprised
by
her
presence
florence
you
wait
also
said
madeline
at
the
doorway
and
turned
in
alone
and
she
had
stepped
into
a
patio
littered
with
alfalfa
straw
and
debris
all
clear
in
the
sunlight
upon
a
bench
back
toward
her
sat
a
man
looking
out
through
the
rents
in
the
broken
wall
he
had
not
heard
her
the
place
was
not
quite
so
filthy
and
stifling
as
the
passages
madeline
had
come
through
to
get
there
then
she
saw
that
it
had
been
used
as
a
corral
a
rat
ran
boldly
across
the
dirt
floor
the
air
swarmed
with
flies
which
the
man
brushed
at
with
weary
hand
madeline
did
not
recognize
stewart
the
side
of
his
face
exposed
to
her
gaze
was
black
bruised
bearded
his
clothes
were
ragged
and
soiled
there
were
bits
of
alfalfa
in
his
hair
his
shoulders
sagged
he
made
a
wretched
and
hopeless
figure
sitting
there
madeline
divined
something
of
why
nels
shrank
from
being
present
mr
stewart
it
is
i
miss
hammond
come
to
see
you
she
said
he
grew
suddenly
perfectly
motionless
as
if
he
had
been
changed
to
stone
she
repeated
her
greeting
his
body
jerked
he
moved
violently
as
if
instinctively
to
turn
and
face
this
intruder
but
a
more
violent
movement
checked
him
madeline
waited
how
singular
that
this
ruined
cowboy
had
pride
which
kept
him
from
showing
his
face
and
was
it
not
shame
more
than
pride
mr
stewart
i
have
come
to
talk
with
you
if
you
will
let
go
away
he
muttered
mr
stewart
she
began
with
involuntary
hauteur
but
instantly
she
corrected
herself
became
deliberate
and
cool
for
she
saw
that
she
might
fail
to
be
even
heard
by
this
man
i
have
come
to
help
you
will
you
let
me
for
god
sake
you
you
he
choked
over
the
words
go
away
stewart
perhaps
it
was
for
god
sake
that
i
came
said
madeline
gently
surely
it
was
for
yours
and
your
sister
madeline
bit
her
tongue
for
she
had
not
meant
to
betray
her
knowledge
of
letty
he
groaned
and
staggering
up
to
the
broken
wall
he
leaned
there
with
his
face
hidden
madeline
reflected
that
perhaps
the
slip
of
speech
had
been
well
stewart
please
let
me
say
what
i
have
to
say
he
was
silent
and
she
gathered
courage
and
inspiration
stillwell
is
deeply
hurt
deeply
grieved
that
he
could
not
turn
you
back
from
this
this
fatal
course
my
brother
is
also
they
wanted
to
help
you
and
so
do
i
have
come
thinking
somehow
i
might
succeed
where
they
have
failed
nels
brought
your
sister
letter
i
i
read
it
i
was
only
the
more
determined
to
try
to
help
you
and
indirectly
help
your
mother
and
letty
stewart
we
want
you
to
come
to
the
ranch
stillwell
needs
you
for
his
foreman
the
position
is
open
to
you
and
you
can
name
your
salary
both
al
and
stillwell
are
worried
about
don
carlos
the
vaqueros
and
the
raids
down
along
the
border
my
cowboys
are
without
a
capable
leader
will
you
come
no
he
answered
but
stillwell
wants
you
so
stewart
i
want
you
to
his
replies
had
been
hoarse
loud
furious
they
disconcerted
madeline
and
she
paused
trying
to
think
of
a
way
to
proceed
stewart
staggered
away
from
the
wall
and
falling
upon
the
bench
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
all
his
motions
like
his
speech
had
been
violent
will
you
please
go
away
he
asked
stewart
certainly
i
can
not
remain
here
longer
if
you
insist
upon
my
going
but
why
not
listen
to
me
when
i
want
so
much
to
help
you
why
i
a
damned
blackguard
he
burst
out
but
i
was
a
gentleman
once
and
i
not
so
low
that
i
can
stand
for
you
seeing
me
when
i
made
up
my
mind
to
help
you
i
made
it
up
to
see
you
wherever
you
were
stewart
come
away
come
back
with
us
to
the
ranch
you
are
in
a
bad
condition
now
everything
looks
black
to
you
but
that
will
pass
when
you
are
among
friends
again
you
will
get
well
you
will
be
your
old
self
the
very
fact
that
you
were
once
a
gentleman
that
you
come
of
good
family
makes
you
owe
so
much
more
to
yourself
why
stewart
think
how
young
you
are
it
is
a
shame
to
waste
your
life
come
back
with
miss
hammond
this
was
my
last
plunge
he
replied
despondently
too
oh
no
it
is
not
so
bad
as
it
too
at
least
make
an
effort
stewart
try
no
there
no
use
i
done
for
please
leave
me
thank
you
for
he
had
been
savage
then
sullen
and
now
he
was
grim
madeline
all
but
lost
power
to
resist
his
strange
deadly
cold
finality
no
doubt
he
knew
he
was
doomed
yet
something
halted
her
held
her
even
as
she
took
a
backward
step
and
she
became
conscious
of
a
subtle
change
in
her
own
feeling
she
had
come
into
that
squalid
hole
madeline
hammond
earnest
enough
kind
enough
in
her
own
intentions
but
she
had
been
almost
imperious
a
woman
habitually
proudly
used
to
being
obeyed
she
divined
that
all
the
pride
blue
blood
wealth
culture
distinction
all
the
impersonal
condescending
persuasion
all
the
fatuous
philanthropy
on
earth
would
not
avail
to
turn
this
man
a
single
from
his
downward
career
to
destruction
her
coming
had
terribly
augmented
his
bitter
hate
of
himself
she
was
going
to
fail
to
help
him
she
experienced
a
sensation
of
impotence
that
amounted
almost
to
distress
the
situation
assumed
a
tragic
keenness
she
had
set
forth
to
reverse
the
tide
of
a
wild
cowboy
fortunes
she
faced
the
swift
wasting
of
his
life
the
damnation
of
his
soul
the
subtle
consciousness
of
change
in
her
was
the
birth
of
that
faith
she
had
revered
in
stillwell
and
all
at
once
she
became
merely
a
woman
brave
and
sweet
and
indomitable
stewart
look
at
me
she
said
he
shuddered
she
advanced
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
bent
shoulder
under
the
light
touch
he
appeared
to
sink
look
at
me
she
repeated
but
he
could
not
lift
his
head
he
was
abject
crushed
he
dared
not
show
his
swollen
blackened
face
his
fierce
cramped
posture
revealed
more
than
his
features
might
have
shown
it
betrayed
the
torturing
shame
of
a
man
of
pride
and
passion
a
man
who
had
been
confronted
in
his
degradation
by
the
woman
he
had
dared
to
enshrine
in
his
heart
it
betrayed
his
love
listen
then
went
on
madeline
and
her
voice
was
unsteady
listen
to
me
stewart
the
greatest
men
are
those
who
have
fallen
deepest
into
the
mire
sinned
most
suffered
most
and
then
have
fought
their
evil
natures
and
conquered
i
think
you
can
shake
off
this
desperate
mood
and
be
a
no
he
cried
listen
to
me
again
somehow
i
know
you
worthy
of
stillwell
love
will
you
come
back
with
us
for
his
sake
no
it
too
late
i
tell
stewart
the
best
thing
in
life
is
faith
in
human
nature
i
have
faith
in
you
i
believe
you
are
worth
you
only
kind
and
good
saying
that
you
ca
mean
i
mean
it
with
all
my
heart
she
replied
a
sudden
rich
warmth
suffusing
her
body
as
she
saw
the
first
sign
of
his
softening
will
you
come
back
if
not
for
your
own
sake
or
stillwell
then
for
mine
what
am
i
to
such
a
woman
as
you
a
man
in
trouble
stewart
but
i
have
come
to
help
you
to
show
my
faith
in
if
i
believed
that
i
might
try
he
said
listen
she
began
softly
hurriedly
my
word
is
not
lightly
given
let
it
prove
my
faith
in
you
look
at
me
now
and
say
you
will
he
heaved
up
his
big
frame
as
if
trying
to
cast
off
a
giant
burden
and
then
slowly
he
turned
toward
her
his
face
was
a
blotched
and
terrible
thing
the
physical
brutalizing
marks
were
there
and
at
that
instant
all
that
appeared
human
to
madeline
was
the
dawning
in
dead
eyes
of
a
beautiful
light
i
come
he
whispered
huskily
give
me
a
few
days
to
straighten
up
then
i
ix
the
new
foreman
toward
the
end
of
the
week
stillwell
informed
madeline
that
stewart
had
arrived
at
the
ranch
and
had
taken
up
quarters
with
nels
gene
sick
he
looks
bad
said
the
old
cattleman
he
so
weak
shaky
he
ca
lift
a
cup
nels
says
that
gene
has
hed
some
bad
spells
a
little
liquor
would
straighten
him
up
now
but
nels
ca
force
him
to
drink
a
drop
an
has
hed
to
sneak
some
liquor
in
his
coffee
wal
i
think
we
pull
gene
through
he
forgotten
a
lot
i
was
goin
to
tell
him
what
he
did
to
me
up
at
rodeo
but
i
know
if
he
believe
it
be
sicker
than
he
is
gene
losin
his
mind
or
he
got
powerful
strange
on
from
that
time
stillwell
who
evidently
found
madeline
his
most
sympathetic
listener
unburdened
himself
daily
of
his
hopes
and
fears
and
conjectures
stewart
was
really
ill
it
became
necessary
to
send
link
stevens
for
a
physician
then
stewart
began
slowly
to
mend
and
presently
was
able
to
get
up
and
about
stillwell
said
the
cowboy
lacked
interest
and
seemed
to
be
a
broken
man
this
statement
however
the
old
cattleman
modified
as
stewart
continued
to
improve
then
presently
it
was
a
good
augury
of
stewart
progress
that
the
cowboys
once
more
took
up
the
teasing
relation
which
had
been
characteristic
of
them
before
his
illness
a
cowboy
was
indeed
out
of
sorts
when
he
could
not
vent
his
peculiar
humor
on
somebody
or
something
stewart
had
evidently
become
a
broad
target
for
their
badinage
wal
the
boys
are
sure
after
gene
said
stillwell
with
his
huge
smile
joshin
him
all
the
time
about
how
he
sits
around
an
hangs
around
an
loafs
around
jest
to
get
a
glimpse
of
you
miss
majesty
sure
all
the
boys
hev
a
pretty
bad
case
over
their
pretty
boss
but
none
of
them
is
a
marker
to
gene
he
got
it
so
bad
miss
majesty
thet
he
actooly
do
know
they
are
joshin
him
it
the
strange
thing
i
ever
seen
why
gene
was
always
a
feller
thet
you
could
josh
an
he
laugh
an
get
back
at
you
but
he
was
never
before
deaf
to
talk
an
there
was
a
certain
limit
no
feller
cared
to
cross
with
him
now
he
takes
every
word
an
smiles
dreamy
like
an
jest
looks
looks
why
he
beginnin
to
make
me
tired
he
never
run
thet
bunch
of
cowboys
if
he
does
wake
up
madeline
smiled
her
amusement
and
expressed
a
belief
that
stillwell
wanted
too
much
in
such
short
time
from
a
man
who
had
done
body
and
mind
a
grievous
injury
it
had
been
impossible
for
madeline
to
fail
to
observe
singular
behavior
she
never
went
out
to
take
her
customary
walks
and
rides
without
seeing
him
somewhere
in
the
distance
she
was
aware
that
he
watched
for
her
and
avoided
meeting
her
when
she
sat
on
the
porch
during
the
afternoon
or
at
sunset
stewart
could
always
be
descried
at
some
point
near
he
idled
listlessly
in
the
sun
lounged
on
the
porch
of
his
sat
whittling
the
top
bar
of
the
corral
fence
and
always
it
seemed
to
madeline
he
was
watching
her
once
while
going
the
rounds
with
her
gardener
she
encountered
stewart
and
greeted
him
kindly
he
said
little
but
he
was
not
embarrassed
she
did
not
recognize
in
his
face
any
feature
that
she
remembered
in
fact
on
each
of
the
few
occasions
when
she
had
met
stewart
he
had
looked
so
different
that
she
had
no
consistent
idea
of
his
facial
appearance
he
was
now
pale
haggard
drawn
his
eyes
held
a
shadow
through
which
shone
a
soft
subdued
light
and
once
having
observed
this
madeline
fancied
it
was
like
the
light
in
majesty
eyes
in
the
dumb
worshiping
eyes
of
her
favorite
she
told
stewart
that
she
hoped
he
would
soon
be
in
the
saddle
again
and
passed
on
her
way
that
stewart
loved
her
madeline
could
not
help
but
see
she
endeavored
to
think
of
him
as
one
of
the
many
who
she
was
glad
to
know
liked
her
but
she
could
not
regulate
her
thoughts
to
fit
the
order
her
intelligence
prescribed
thought
of
stewart
dissociated
itself
from
thought
of
the
other
cowboys
when
she
discovered
this
she
felt
a
little
surprise
and
annoyance
then
she
interrogated
herself
and
concluded
that
it
was
not
that
stewart
was
so
different
from
his
comrades
but
that
circumstances
made
him
stand
out
from
them
she
recalled
her
meeting
with
him
that
night
when
he
had
tried
to
force
her
to
marry
him
this
was
unforgettable
in
itself
she
called
subsequent
mention
of
him
and
found
it
had
been
peculiarly
memorable
the
man
and
his
actions
seemed
to
hinge
on
events
lastly
the
fact
standing
clear
of
all
others
in
its
relation
to
her
interest
was
that
he
had
been
almost
ruined
almost
lost
and
she
had
saved
him
that
alone
was
sufficient
to
explain
why
she
thought
of
him
differently
she
had
befriended
uplifted
the
other
cowboys
she
had
saved
stewart
life
to
be
sure
he
had
been
a
ruffian
but
a
woman
could
not
save
the
life
of
even
a
ruffian
without
remembering
it
with
gladness
madeline
at
length
decided
her
interest
in
stewart
was
natural
and
that
her
deeper
feeling
was
pity
perhaps
the
interest
had
been
forced
from
her
however
she
gave
the
pity
as
she
gave
everything
stewart
recovered
his
strength
though
not
in
time
to
ride
at
the
spring
and
stillwell
discussed
with
madeline
the
advisability
of
making
the
cowboy
his
foreman
wal
gene
seems
to
be
gettin
along
said
stillwell
but
he
like
his
old
self
i
think
more
of
him
at
thet
but
where
his
spirit
the
boys
ride
all
over
him
mebbe
i
do
best
to
wait
longer
now
as
the
slack
season
is
on
all
the
same
if
those
vaquero
of
don
carlos
do
lay
low
i
send
gene
over
there
thet
wake
him
a
few
days
afterward
stillwell
came
to
madeline
rubbing
his
big
hands
in
satisfaction
and
wearing
a
grin
that
was
enormous
miss
majesty
i
reckon
before
this
i
said
things
was
strange
but
now
gene
stewart
has
gone
an
done
it
listen
to
me
them
greasers
down
on
our
slope
hev
been
gettin
prosperous
they
like
bad
weeds
an
they
got
a
new
padre
the
little
old
feller
from
el
cajon
padre
marcos
wal
this
was
all
right
all
the
boys
thought
except
gene
an
he
got
blacker
thunder
an
roared
round
like
a
dehorned
bull
i
was
sure
glad
to
see
he
could
get
mad
again
then
gene
haids
down
the
slope
fer
the
church
nels
an
me
follered
him
he
might
hev
been
took
sudden
with
a
crazy
spell
or
somethin
he
never
been
jest
right
yet
since
he
left
off
drinkin
wal
we
run
into
him
comin
out
of
the
church
we
never
was
so
dumfounded
in
our
lives
gene
was
crazy
all
right
he
sure
hed
a
spell
but
it
was
the
kind
of
a
spell
he
hed
thet
paralyzed
us
he
ran
past
us
like
a
streak
an
we
follered
we
could
ketch
him
we
heerd
him
laugh
the
strangest
laugh
i
ever
heerd
you
thought
the
feller
was
suddenly
made
a
king
he
was
like
thet
feller
who
was
tied
in
a
an
throwed
into
the
sea
an
cut
his
way
out
an
swam
to
the
island
where
the
treasures
was
an
stood
up
yellin
world
is
mine
wal
when
we
got
up
to
his
he
was
gone
he
did
come
back
all
day
an
all
night
frankie
slade
who
has
a
sharp
tongue
says
gene
hed
gone
crazy
for
liquor
an
thet
was
his
finish
nels
was
some
worried
an
i
was
sick
wal
this
mawnin
i
went
over
to
nels
bunk
some
of
the
fellers
was
there
all
speculatin
about
gene
then
big
as
life
gene
struts
round
the
corner
he
was
the
same
gene
his
face
was
pale
an
his
eyes
burned
like
fire
he
had
thet
old
mockin
cool
smile
an
besides
thet
i
could
understand
frankie
slade
up
an
made
a
remark
no
wuss
than
he
been
makin
fer
days
an
gene
tumbled
him
out
of
his
chair
punched
him
good
walked
all
over
him
frankie
was
hurt
so
much
as
he
was
bewildered
he
says
the
hell
struck
you
an
gene
says
kind
of
sweet
like
you
may
be
a
nice
feller
when
you
alone
but
your
talk
offensive
to
a
gentleman
after
thet
what
was
said
to
gene
was
with
a
nice
smile
now
miss
majesty
it
beyond
me
what
to
allow
for
gene
sudden
change
first
off
i
thought
padre
marcos
had
converted
him
i
actooly
thought
thet
but
i
reckon
it
only
gene
stewart
come
back
the
old
gene
stewart
some
thet
all
i
care
about
i
rememberin
how
i
once
told
you
thet
gene
was
the
last
of
the
cowboys
perhaps
i
should
hev
said
he
the
last
of
my
kind
of
cowboys
wal
miss
majesty
you
be
apprecatin
of
what
i
meant
from
now
it
was
also
beyond
madeline
to
account
for
gene
stewart
antics
and
making
allowance
for
the
old
cattleman
fancy
she
did
not
weigh
his
remarks
very
heavily
she
guessed
why
stewart
might
have
been
angry
at
the
presence
of
padre
marcos
madeline
supposed
that
it
was
rather
an
unusual
circumstance
for
a
cowboy
to
be
converted
to
religious
belief
but
it
was
possible
and
she
knew
that
religious
fervor
often
manifested
itself
in
extremes
of
feeling
and
action
most
likely
in
case
his
real
manner
had
been
both
misunderstood
and
exaggerated
however
madeline
had
a
curious
desire
which
she
did
not
wholly
admit
to
herself
to
see
the
cowboy
and
make
her
own
deductions
the
opportunity
did
not
present
itself
for
nearly
two
weeks
stewart
had
taken
up
his
duties
as
foreman
and
his
activities
were
ceaseless
he
was
absent
most
of
the
time
ranging
down
toward
the
mexican
line
when
he
returned
stillwell
sent
for
him
this
was
late
in
the
afternoon
of
a
day
in
the
middle
of
april
alfred
and
florence
were
with
madeline
on
the
porch
they
saw
the
cowboy
turn
his
horse
over
to
one
of
the
mexican
boys
at
the
corral
and
then
come
with
weary
step
up
to
the
house
beating
the
dust
out
of
his
gauntlets
little
streams
of
gray
sand
trickled
from
his
sombrero
as
he
removed
it
and
bowed
to
the
women
madeline
saw
the
man
she
remembered
but
with
a
singularly
different
aspect
his
skin
was
brown
his
eyes
were
piercing
and
dark
and
steady
he
carried
himself
erect
he
seemed
preoccupied
and
there
was
not
a
trace
of
embarrassment
in
his
manner
wal
gene
i
sure
glad
to
see
you
stillwell
was
saying
where
do
you
hail
from
guadaloupe
canyon
replied
the
cowboy
stillwell
whistled
way
down
there
you
do
mean
you
follered
them
hoss
tracks
thet
far
all
the
way
from
don
carlos
rancho
across
the
mexican
line
i
took
nick
steele
with
me
nick
is
the
best
tracker
in
the
outfit
this
trail
we
were
on
led
along
the
foothill
valleys
first
we
thought
whoever
made
it
was
hunting
for
water
but
they
passed
two
ranches
without
watering
at
seaton
wash
they
dug
for
water
here
they
met
a
of
burros
that
came
down
the
mountain
trail
the
burros
were
heavily
loaded
horse
and
burro
tracks
struck
south
from
seaton
to
the
old
california
emigrant
road
we
followed
the
trail
through
guadelope
canyon
and
across
the
border
on
the
way
back
we
stopped
at
slaughter
ranch
where
the
united
states
cavalry
are
camping
there
we
met
foresters
from
the
peloncillo
forest
reserve
if
these
fellows
knew
anything
they
kept
it
to
themselves
so
we
hit
the
trail
wal
i
reckon
you
know
enough
inquired
stillwell
slowly
i
reckon
replied
stewart
wal
out
with
it
then
said
stillwell
gruffly
miss
hammond
be
kept
in
the
dark
much
longer
make
your
report
to
the
cowboy
shifted
his
dark
gaze
to
madeline
he
was
cool
and
slow
we
losing
a
few
cattle
on
the
open
range
by
the
vaqueros
some
of
these
cattle
are
driven
across
the
valley
others
up
to
the
foothills
so
far
as
i
can
find
out
no
cattle
are
being
driven
south
so
this
raiding
is
a
blind
to
fool
the
cowboys
don
carlos
is
a
mexican
rebel
he
located
his
rancho
here
a
few
years
ago
and
pretended
to
raise
cattle
all
that
time
he
has
been
smuggling
arms
and
ammunition
across
the
border
he
was
for
madero
against
diaz
now
he
is
against
madero
because
he
and
all
the
rebels
think
madero
failed
to
keep
his
promises
there
will
be
another
revolution
and
all
the
arms
go
from
the
states
across
the
border
those
burros
i
told
about
were
packed
with
contraband
that
a
matter
for
the
united
states
cavalry
they
are
patrolling
the
border
said
alfred
they
ca
stop
the
smuggling
of
arms
not
down
in
that
wild
corner
replied
stewart
what
is
my
my
duty
what
has
it
to
do
with
me
inquired
madeline
somewhat
perturbed
wal
miss
majesty
i
reckon
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
put
in
stillwell
thet
my
bizness
an
stewart
but
i
jest
wanted
you
to
know
there
might
be
some
trouble
follerin
my
your
orders
i
want
to
send
stewart
over
to
fire
don
carlos
an
his
vaqueros
off
the
range
they
got
to
go
don
carlos
is
breakin
the
law
of
the
united
states
an
doin
it
on
our
property
an
with
our
hosses
hev
i
your
permission
miss
hammond
why
assuredly
you
have
stillwell
you
know
what
to
do
alfred
what
do
you
think
best
it
make
trouble
majesty
but
it
got
to
be
done
replied
alfred
here
you
have
a
crowd
of
eastern
friends
due
next
month
we
want
the
range
to
ourselves
then
but
stillwell
if
you
drive
those
vaqueros
off
wo
they
hang
around
in
the
foothills
i
declare
they
are
a
bad
stillwell
mind
was
not
at
ease
he
paced
the
porch
with
a
frown
clouding
his
brow
gene
i
reckon
you
got
this
greaser
deal
figgered
me
said
stillwell
now
what
do
you
say
he
have
to
be
forced
off
replied
stewart
quietly
the
pretty
slick
but
his
vaqueros
are
bad
actors
it
just
this
way
nels
said
the
other
day
to
me
i
have
packed
a
gun
for
years
until
lately
and
it
feels
good
whenever
i
meet
any
of
those
strange
greasers
you
see
stillwell
don
carlos
has
vaqueros
coming
and
going
all
the
time
they
guerrilla
bands
that
all
and
they
getting
uglier
there
have
been
several
lately
a
rancher
named
white
who
lives
up
the
valley
was
badly
hurt
it
only
a
matter
of
time
till
something
stirs
up
the
boys
here
stillwell
you
know
nels
and
monty
and
sure
i
know
an
you
not
mentionin
one
more
particular
cowboy
in
my
outfit
said
stillwell
with
a
dry
chuckle
and
a
glance
at
stewart
madeline
divined
the
covert
meaning
and
a
slight
chill
passed
over
her
as
if
a
cold
wind
had
blown
in
from
the
hills
stewart
i
see
you
carry
a
gun
she
said
pointing
to
a
black
handle
protruding
from
a
sheath
swinging
low
along
his
leather
chaps
yes
why
do
you
carry
it
she
asked
well
he
said
it
not
a
pretty
gun
and
it
she
caught
the
inference
the
gun
was
not
an
ornament
his
keen
steady
dark
gaze
caused
her
vague
alarm
what
had
once
seemed
cool
and
audacious
about
this
cowboy
was
now
cold
and
powerful
and
mystical
both
her
instinct
and
her
intelligence
realized
the
steel
fiber
of
the
man
nature
as
she
was
his
employer
she
had
the
right
to
demand
that
he
should
not
do
what
was
so
chillingly
manifest
that
he
might
do
but
madeline
could
not
demand
she
felt
curiously
young
and
weak
and
the
five
months
of
western
life
were
as
if
they
had
never
been
she
now
had
to
do
with
a
question
involving
human
life
and
the
value
she
placed
upon
human
life
and
its
spiritual
significance
was
a
matter
far
from
her
thoughts
a
strange
idea
flashed
up
did
she
place
too
much
value
upon
all
human
life
she
checked
that
wondering
almost
horrified
at
herself
and
then
her
intuition
told
her
that
she
possessed
a
far
stronger
power
to
move
these
primitive
men
than
any
woman
stern
rule
or
order
stewart
i
do
not
fully
understand
what
you
hint
that
nels
and
his
comrades
might
do
please
be
frank
with
me
do
you
mean
nels
would
shoot
upon
little
provocation
miss
hammond
as
far
as
nels
is
concerned
shooting
is
now
just
a
matter
of
his
meeting
don
carlos
vaqueros
it
wonderful
what
nels
has
stood
from
them
considering
the
mexicans
he
already
already
killed
stewart
you
are
not
in
earnest
cried
madeline
shocked
i
am
nels
has
seen
hard
life
along
the
arizona
border
he
likes
peace
as
well
as
any
man
but
a
few
years
of
that
does
change
what
the
early
days
made
of
him
as
for
nick
steele
and
monty
they
just
bad
men
and
looking
for
how
about
yourself
stewart
stillwell
remark
was
not
lost
upon
me
said
madeline
prompted
by
curiosity
stewart
did
not
reply
he
looked
at
her
in
respectful
silence
in
her
keen
earnestness
madeline
saw
beneath
his
cool
exterior
and
was
all
the
more
baffled
was
there
a
slight
inscrutable
mocking
light
in
his
eyes
or
was
it
only
her
imagination
however
the
cowboy
face
was
as
hard
as
flint
stewart
i
have
come
to
love
my
ranch
said
madeline
slowly
and
i
care
a
great
deal
for
my
my
cowboys
it
would
be
dreadful
if
they
were
to
kill
anybody
or
especially
if
one
of
them
should
be
miss
hammond
you
changed
things
considerable
out
here
but
you
ca
change
these
men
all
that
needed
to
start
them
is
a
little
trouble
and
this
mexican
revolution
is
bound
to
make
rough
times
along
some
of
the
wilder
passes
across
the
border
we
in
line
that
all
and
the
boys
are
getting
stirred
very
well
then
i
must
accept
the
inevitable
i
am
facing
a
rough
time
and
some
of
my
cowboys
can
not
be
checked
much
longer
but
stewart
whatever
you
have
been
in
the
past
you
have
she
smiled
at
him
and
her
voice
was
singularly
sweet
and
rich
stillwell
has
so
often
referred
to
you
as
the
last
of
his
kind
of
cowboy
i
have
just
a
faint
idea
of
what
a
wild
life
you
have
led
perhaps
that
fits
you
to
be
a
leader
of
such
rough
men
i
am
no
judge
of
what
a
leader
should
do
in
this
crisis
my
cowboys
are
entailing
risk
in
my
employ
my
property
is
not
safe
perhaps
my
life
even
might
be
endangered
i
want
to
rely
upon
you
since
stillwell
believes
and
i
too
that
you
are
the
man
for
this
place
i
shall
give
you
no
orders
but
is
it
too
much
to
ask
that
you
be
my
kind
of
a
cowboy
madeline
remembered
stewart
former
brutality
and
shame
and
abject
worship
and
she
measured
the
great
change
in
him
by
the
contrast
afforded
now
in
his
dark
changeless
intent
face
miss
hammond
what
kind
of
a
cowboy
is
that
he
asked
i
i
do
exactly
know
it
is
that
kind
which
i
feel
you
might
be
but
i
do
know
that
in
the
problem
at
hand
i
want
your
actions
to
be
governed
by
reason
not
passion
human
life
is
not
for
any
man
to
sacrifice
unless
in
or
in
protecting
those
dependent
upon
him
what
stillwell
and
you
hinted
makes
me
afraid
of
nels
and
nick
steele
and
monty
can
not
they
be
controlled
i
want
to
feel
that
they
will
not
go
gunning
for
don
carlos
men
i
want
to
avoid
all
violence
and
yet
when
my
guests
come
i
want
to
feel
that
they
will
be
safe
from
danger
or
fright
or
even
annoyance
may
i
not
rely
wholly
upon
you
stewart
just
trust
you
to
manage
these
obstreperous
cowboys
and
protect
my
property
and
alfred
and
take
care
of
us
of
me
until
this
revolution
is
ended
i
have
never
had
a
day
worry
since
i
bought
the
ranch
it
is
not
that
i
want
to
shirk
my
responsibilities
it
is
that
i
like
being
happy
may
i
put
so
much
faith
in
you
i
hope
so
miss
hammond
replied
stewart
it
was
an
instant
response
but
none
the
less
fraught
with
consciousness
of
responsibility
he
waited
a
moment
and
then
as
neither
stillwell
nor
madeline
offered
further
speech
he
bowed
and
turned
down
the
path
his
long
spurs
clinking
in
the
gravel
wal
wal
exclaimed
stillwell
thet
no
little
job
you
give
him
miss
it
was
a
woman
cunning
stillwell
said
alfred
my
sister
used
to
be
a
wonder
at
getting
her
own
way
when
we
were
kids
just
a
smile
or
two
a
few
sweet
words
or
turns
of
thought
and
she
had
what
she
al
what
a
character
to
give
me
protested
madeline
indeed
i
was
deeply
in
earnest
with
stewart
i
do
not
understand
just
why
but
i
trust
him
he
seems
like
iron
and
steel
then
i
was
a
little
frightened
at
the
prospect
of
trouble
with
the
vaqueros
both
you
and
stillwell
have
influenced
me
to
look
upon
stewart
as
invaluable
i
thought
it
best
to
confess
my
utter
helplessness
and
to
look
to
him
for
majesty
whatever
actuated
you
it
was
a
stroke
of
diplomacy
replied
her
brother
stewart
has
got
good
stuff
in
him
he
was
down
and
out
well
he
made
a
game
fight
and
it
looks
as
if
he
win
trusting
him
giving
him
responsibility
relying
upon
him
was
the
surest
way
to
strengthen
his
hold
upon
himself
then
that
little
touch
of
sentiment
about
being
your
kind
of
cowboy
and
protecting
you
well
if
gene
stewart
does
develop
into
an
knight
i
say
i
do
know
cowboys
but
majesty
remember
he
a
composite
of
tiger
breed
and
forked
lightning
and
do
imagine
he
has
failed
you
if
he
gets
into
a
fight
i
sure
tell
you
what
gene
stewart
will
do
said
florence
do
i
know
cowboys
why
they
used
to
take
me
up
on
their
horses
when
i
was
a
baby
gene
stewart
will
be
the
kind
of
cowboy
your
sister
said
he
might
be
whatever
that
is
she
may
not
know
and
we
may
not
guess
but
he
wal
flo
there
you
hit
plumb
center
replied
the
old
cattleman
i
could
be
gladder
if
he
was
my
own
x
don
carlos
vaqueros
early
the
following
morning
stewart
with
a
company
of
cowboys
departed
for
don
carlos
rancho
as
the
day
wore
on
without
any
report
from
him
stillwell
appeared
to
grow
more
at
ease
and
at
nightfall
he
told
madeline
that
he
guessed
there
was
now
no
reason
for
concern
wal
though
it
sure
amazin
strange
he
continued
i
been
worryin
some
about
how
we
was
goin
to
fire
don
carlos
but
gene
has
a
way
of
doin
next
day
stillwell
and
alfred
decided
to
ride
over
don
carlos
place
taking
madeline
and
florence
with
them
and
upon
the
return
trip
to
stop
at
alfred
ranch
they
started
in
the
cool
gray
dawn
and
after
three
hours
riding
as
the
sun
began
to
get
bright
they
entered
a
mesquite
grove
surrounding
corrals
and
barns
and
a
number
of
low
squat
buildings
and
a
huge
rambling
structure
all
built
of
adobe
and
mostly
crumbling
to
ruin
only
one
green
spot
relieved
the
bald
red
of
grounds
and
walls
and
this
evidently
was
made
by
the
spring
which
had
given
both
value
and
fame
to
don
carlos
range
the
approach
to
the
house
was
through
a
wide
courtyard
bare
stony
hard
packed
with
and
in
front
of
a
long
porch
several
dusty
tired
horses
stood
with
drooping
heads
and
bridles
down
their
wet
flanks
attesting
to
travel
just
ended
wal
it
al
if
there
ai
pat
hawe
hoss
i
eat
it
exclaimed
stillwell
what
pat
want
here
anyhow
growled
alfred
no
one
was
in
sight
but
madeline
heard
loud
voices
coming
from
the
house
stillwell
dismounted
at
the
porch
and
stalked
in
at
the
door
alfred
leaped
off
his
horse
helped
florence
and
madeline
down
and
bidding
them
rest
and
wait
on
the
porch
he
followed
stillwell
i
hate
these
greaser
places
said
florence
with
a
grimace
so
mysterious
and
creepy
just
watch
now
they
be
greasers
slip
right
up
out
of
the
ground
there
be
an
ugly
face
in
every
door
and
window
and
it
like
a
huge
barn
with
its
characteristic
odor
permeated
by
tobacco
smoke
replied
madeline
sitting
down
beside
florence
i
do
think
very
much
of
this
end
of
my
purchase
florence
is
that
don
black
horse
over
there
in
the
corral
it
sure
is
then
the
don
heah
yet
i
wish
we
had
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
come
over
there
that
does
sound
from
the
corridor
came
the
rattling
of
spurs
tramping
of
boots
and
loud
voices
madeline
detected
alfred
quick
notes
when
he
was
annoyed
we
rustle
back
home
then
he
said
the
answer
came
no
madeline
recognized
stewart
voice
and
she
quickly
straightened
up
i
have
them
in
here
went
on
alfred
outdoors
or
in
they
got
to
be
with
us
replied
stewart
sharply
listen
al
came
the
boom
of
stillwell
big
voice
now
that
butted
in
over
hyar
with
the
girls
you
let
stewart
run
then
a
crowd
of
men
tramped
out
upon
the
porch
stewart
and
somber
was
in
the
lead
nels
hung
close
to
him
and
madeline
quick
glance
saw
that
nels
had
undergone
some
indescribable
change
the
grinning
don
carlos
came
jostling
out
beside
a
gaunt
man
wearing
a
silver
shield
this
no
doubt
was
pat
hawe
in
the
background
behind
stillwell
and
alfred
stood
nick
steele
head
and
shoulders
over
a
number
of
vaqueros
and
cowboys
miss
hammond
i
sorry
you
came
said
stewart
bluntly
we
in
a
muddle
here
i
insisted
that
you
and
flo
be
kept
close
to
us
explain
later
if
you
ca
stop
your
ears
i
beg
you
to
overlook
rough
with
that
he
turned
to
the
men
behind
him
nick
take
booly
go
back
to
monty
and
the
boys
fetch
out
that
stuff
all
of
it
rustle
now
stillwell
and
alfred
disengaged
themselves
from
the
crowd
to
take
up
positions
in
front
of
madeline
and
florence
pat
hawe
leaned
against
a
post
and
insolently
ogled
madeline
and
then
florence
don
carlos
pressed
forward
his
whole
figure
filled
madeline
reluctant
but
fascinated
eyes
he
wore
tight
velveteen
breeches
with
a
heavy
fold
down
the
outside
seam
which
was
ornamented
with
silver
buttons
round
his
waist
was
a
sash
and
a
belt
with
fringed
holster
from
which
protruded
a
gun
a
vest
or
waistcoat
richly
embroidered
partly
concealed
a
blouse
of
silk
and
wholly
revealed
a
silken
scarf
round
his
neck
his
swarthy
face
showed
dark
lines
like
cords
under
the
surface
his
little
eyes
were
exceedingly
prominent
and
glittering
to
madeline
his
face
seemed
to
be
a
bold
handsome
mask
through
which
his
eyes
piercingly
betrayed
the
evil
nature
of
the
man
he
bowed
low
with
elaborate
and
sinuous
grace
his
smile
revealed
brilliant
teeth
enhanced
the
brilliance
of
his
eyes
he
slowly
spread
deprecatory
hands
senoritas
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
he
said
how
strange
it
was
for
madeline
to
hear
english
spoken
in
a
soft
whiningly
sweet
accent
the
gracious
hospitality
of
don
carlos
has
passed
with
his
stewart
stepped
forward
and
thrusting
don
carlos
aside
he
called
make
way
there
the
crowd
fell
back
to
the
tramp
of
heavy
boots
cowboys
appeared
staggering
out
of
the
corridor
with
long
boxes
these
they
placed
side
by
side
upon
the
floor
of
the
porch
now
hawe
we
proceed
with
our
business
said
stewart
you
see
these
boxes
do
you
i
reckon
i
see
a
good
many
things
round
hyar
replied
hawe
meaningly
well
do
you
intend
to
open
these
boxes
upon
my
no
retorted
hawe
it
not
my
place
to
meddle
with
property
as
come
by
express
an
all
accounted
fer
you
call
yourself
a
sheriff
exclaimed
stewart
scornfully
mebbe
you
think
so
before
long
rejoined
hawe
sullenly
i
open
them
here
one
of
you
boys
knock
the
tops
off
these
boxes
ordered
stewart
no
not
you
monty
you
use
your
eyes
let
booly
handle
the
ax
rustle
now
monty
price
had
jumped
out
of
the
crowd
into
the
middle
of
the
porch
the
manner
in
which
he
gave
way
to
booly
and
faced
the
vaqueros
was
not
significant
of
friendliness
or
trust
stewart
you
dead
wrong
to
bust
open
them
boxes
thet
the
law
protested
hawe
trying
to
interfere
stewart
pushed
him
back
then
don
carlos
who
had
been
stunned
by
the
appearance
of
the
boxes
suddenly
became
active
in
speech
and
person
stewart
thrust
him
back
also
the
mexican
excitement
increased
he
wildly
gesticulated
he
exclaimed
shrilly
in
spanish
when
however
the
lids
were
wrenched
open
and
an
inside
packing
torn
away
he
grew
rigid
and
silent
madeline
raised
herself
behind
stillwell
to
see
that
the
boxes
were
full
of
rifles
and
ammunition
there
hawe
what
did
i
tell
you
demanded
stewart
i
came
over
here
to
take
charge
of
this
ranch
i
found
these
boxes
hidden
in
an
unused
room
i
suspected
what
they
were
contraband
goods
wal
supposin
they
are
i
do
see
any
call
fer
sech
fuss
as
you
makin
stewart
i
calkilate
you
some
stuck
on
your
new
job
an
want
to
make
a
big
show
before
hawe
stop
slinging
that
kind
of
talk
interrupted
stewart
you
got
too
free
with
your
mouth
once
before
now
here
i
supposed
to
be
consulting
an
officer
of
the
law
will
you
take
charge
of
these
contraband
goods
say
you
holdin
on
high
an
mighty
replied
hawe
in
astonishment
that
was
plainly
pretended
what
you
drivin
at
stewart
muttered
an
imprecation
he
took
several
swift
strides
across
the
porch
he
held
out
his
hands
to
stillwell
as
if
to
indicate
the
hopelessness
of
intelligent
and
reasonable
arbitration
he
looked
at
madeline
with
a
glance
eloquent
of
his
regret
that
he
could
not
handle
the
situation
to
please
her
then
as
he
wheeled
he
came
face
to
face
with
nels
who
had
slipped
forward
out
of
the
crowd
madeline
gathered
serious
import
from
the
meaning
flash
of
eyes
whereby
nels
communicated
something
to
stewart
whatever
that
something
was
it
dispelled
stewart
impatience
a
slight
movement
of
his
hand
brought
monty
price
forward
with
a
jump
in
these
sudden
jumps
of
monty
there
was
a
suggestion
of
restrained
ferocity
then
nels
and
monty
lined
up
behind
stewart
it
was
a
deliberate
action
even
to
madeline
unmistakably
formidable
pat
hawe
face
took
on
an
ugly
look
his
eyes
had
a
reddish
gleam
don
carlos
added
a
pale
face
and
extreme
nervousness
to
his
former
expressions
of
agitation
the
cowboys
edged
away
from
the
vaqueros
and
the
bronzed
bearded
horsemen
who
were
evidently
hawe
assistants
i
driving
at
this
spoke
up
stewart
presently
and
now
he
was
slow
and
caustic
here
contraband
of
war
hawe
do
you
get
that
arms
and
ammunition
for
the
rebels
across
the
border
i
charge
you
as
an
officer
to
confiscate
these
goods
and
to
arrest
the
smuggler
don
these
words
of
stewart
precipitated
a
riot
among
don
carlos
and
his
followers
and
they
surged
wildly
around
the
sheriff
there
was
an
upflinging
of
brown
clenching
hands
a
shrill
jabbering
babel
of
mexican
voices
the
crowd
around
don
carlos
grew
louder
and
denser
with
the
addition
of
armed
vaqueros
and
barefooted
and
herdsmen
and
blanketed
mexicans
the
last
of
whom
suddenly
slipped
from
doors
and
windows
and
round
comers
it
was
a
motley
assemblage
the
laced
fringed
ornamented
vaqueros
presented
a
sharp
contrast
to
the
boys
and
the
ragged
herders
shrill
cries
evidently
from
don
carlos
somewhat
quieted
the
commotion
then
don
carlos
could
be
heard
addressing
sheriff
hawe
in
an
exhortation
of
mingled
english
and
spanish
he
denied
he
avowed
he
proclaimed
and
all
in
rapid
passionate
utterance
he
tossed
his
black
hair
in
his
vehemence
he
waved
his
fists
and
stamped
the
floor
he
rolled
his
glittering
eyes
he
twisted
his
thin
lips
into
a
hundred
different
shapes
and
like
a
cornered
wolf
showed
snarling
white
teeth
it
seemed
to
madeline
that
don
carlos
denied
knowledge
of
the
boxes
of
contraband
goods
then
knowledge
of
their
real
contents
then
knowledge
of
their
destination
and
finally
everything
except
that
they
were
there
in
sight
damning
witnesses
to
somebody
complicity
in
the
breaking
of
neutrality
laws
passionate
as
had
been
his
denial
of
all
this
it
was
as
nothing
compared
to
his
denunciation
of
stewart
senor
stewart
he
keel
my
vaquero
shouted
don
carlos
as
sweating
and
spent
he
concluded
his
arraignment
of
the
cowboy
him
you
must
arrest
senor
stewart
a
bad
man
he
keel
my
vaquero
do
you
hear
thet
yelled
hawe
the
don
got
you
figgered
fer
thet
little
job
at
el
cajon
last
the
clamor
burst
into
a
roar
hawe
began
shaking
his
finger
in
face
and
hoarsely
shouting
then
a
lithe
young
vaquero
swift
as
an
indian
glided
under
hawe
uplifted
arm
whatever
the
action
he
intended
he
was
too
late
for
its
execution
stewart
lunged
out
struck
the
vaquero
and
knocked
him
off
the
porch
as
he
fell
a
dagger
glittered
in
the
sunlight
and
rolled
clinking
over
the
stones
the
man
went
down
hard
and
did
not
move
with
the
same
abrupt
violence
and
a
manner
of
contempt
stewart
threw
hawe
off
the
porch
then
don
carlos
who
being
less
supple
fell
heavily
then
the
mob
backed
before
stewart
rush
until
all
were
down
in
the
courtyard
the
shuffling
of
feet
ceased
the
clanking
of
spurs
and
the
shouting
nels
and
monty
now
reinforced
by
nick
steele
were
as
shadows
of
stewart
so
closely
did
they
follow
him
stewart
waved
them
back
and
stepped
down
into
the
yard
he
was
absolutely
fearless
but
what
struck
madeline
so
keenly
was
his
magnificent
disdain
manifestly
he
knew
the
nature
of
the
men
with
whom
he
was
dealing
from
the
look
of
him
it
was
natural
for
madeline
to
expect
them
to
give
way
before
him
which
they
did
even
hawe
and
his
attendants
sullenly
retreating
don
carlos
got
up
to
confront
stewart
the
prostrate
vaquero
stirred
and
moaned
but
did
not
rise
you

trail
don

i
dealing

with

lying
about

boxes
of
guns
and
cartridges

hours

gamble

get
what
my
cowboys
leave
of
don
carlos
was
either
a
capital
actor
and
gratefully
relieved
at
stewart
leniency
or
else
he
was
thoroughly
cowed
by
references
to
the
troops
si
senor
gracias
senor
he
exclaimed
and
then
turning
away
he
called
to
his
men
they
hurried
after
him
while
the
fallen
vaquero
got
to
his
feet
with
stewart
help
and
staggered
across
the
courtyard
in
a
moment
they
were
gone
leaving
hawe
and
his
several
comrades
behind
hawe
was
spitefully
ejecting
a
wad
of
tobacco
from
his
mouth
and
swearing
in
an
undertone
about

cocked
his
red
eye
speculatively
at

derisively
then
he
started
toward

horses

hand
clapped
on
hawe
shoulder
spinning

round
like
a
top

he
shouted
hoarsely
you
only
a
you
never
hed
a
dollar
or
a
decent
job
till
you
was
mixed
up
with
thet
hammond
woman
stewart
hand
flashed
out
and
hit
hawe
face
in
a
ringing
slap
the
sheriff
head
jerked
back
his
sombrero
fell
to
the
ground
as
he
bent
over
to
reach
it
his
hand
shook
his
arm
shook
his
whole
body
shook
monty
price
jumped
straight
forward
and
crouched
down
with
a
strange
low
cry
stewart
seemed
all
at
once
rigid
bending
a
little
say
miss
hammond
if
there
occasion
to
use
her
name
said
stewart
in
a
voice
that
seemed
coolly
pleasant
yet
had
a
deadly
undernote
hawe
did
a
moment
battle
with
strangling
fury
which
he
conquered
in
some
measure
i
said
you
was
a
drunken
a
tough
as
damn
near
a
desperado
as
we
ever
hed
on
the
border
went
on
hawe
deliberately
his
speech
appeared
to
be
addressed
to
stewart
although
his
eyes
were
riveted
upon
monty
price
i
know
you
plugged
that
vaquero
last
fall
an
when
i
git
my
proof
i
comin
after
that
all
right
hawe
you
can
call
me
what
you
like
and
you
can
come
after
me
when
you
like
replied
stewart
but
you
going
to
get
in
bad
with
me
you
in
bad
now
with
monty
and
nels
pretty
soon
queer
yourself
with
all
the
cowboys
and
the
ranchers
too
if
that
put
sense
into
you
here
listen
to
this
you
knew
what
these
boxes
contained
you
know
don
carlos
has
been
smuggling
arms
and
ammunition
across
the
border
you
know
he
is
hand
and
glove
with
the
rebels
been
wearing
blinders
and
it
has
been
to
your
interest
take
a
hunch
from
me
that
all
light
out
now
and
the
less
we
see
of
your
handsome
mug
the
better
we
like
muttering
cursing
pallid
of
face
hawe
climbed
astride
his
horse
his
comrades
followed
suit
certain
it
appeared
that
the
sheriff
was
contending
with
more
than
fear
and
wrath
he
must
have
had
an
irresistible
impulse
to
fling
more
invective
and
threat
upon
stewart
but
he
was
speechless
savagely
he
spurred
his
horse
and
as
it
snorted
and
leaped
he
turned
in
his
saddle
shaking
his
fist
his
comrades
led
the
way
with
their
horses
clattering
into
a
canter
they
disappeared
through
the
gate
when
later
in
the
day
madeline
and
florence
accompanied
by
alfred
and
stillwell
left
don
carlos
ranch
it
was
not
any
too
soon
for
madeline
the
inside
of
the
mexican
home
was
more
unprepossessing
and
uncomfortable
than
the
outside
the
halls
were
dark
the
rooms
huge
empty
and
musty
and
there
was
an
air
of
silence
and
secrecy
and
mystery
about
them
most
fitting
to
the
character
florence
had
bestowed
upon
the
place
on
the
other
hand
alfred
where
the
party
halted
to
spend
the
night
was
picturesquely
located
small
and
cozy
camplike
in
its
arrangement
and
altogether
agreeable
to
madeline
the
day
long
rides
and
the
exciting
events
had
wearied
her
she
rested
while
florence
and
the
two
men
got
supper
during
the
meal
stillwell
expressed
satisfaction
over
the
good
riddance
of
the
vaqueros
and
with
his
usual
optimism
trusted
he
had
seen
the
last
of
them
alfred
too
took
a
decidedly
favorable
view
of
the
day
proceedings
however
it
was
not
lost
upon
madeline
that
florence
appeared
unusually
quiet
and
thoughtful
madeline
wondered
a
little
at
the
cause
she
remembered
that
stewart
had
wanted
to
come
with
them
or
detail
a
few
cowboys
to
accompany
them
but
alfred
had
laughed
at
the
idea
and
would
have
none
of
it
after
supper
alfred
monopolized
the
conversation
by
describing
what
he
wanted
to
do
to
improve
his
home
before
he
and
florence
were
married
then
at
an
early
hour
they
all
retired
madeline
deep
slumbers
were
disturbed
by
a
pounding
upon
the
wall
and
then
by
florence
crying
out
in
answer
to
a
call
get
up
throw
some
clothes
on
and
come
out
it
was
alfred
voice
what
the
matter
asked
florence
as
she
slipped
out
of
bed
alfred
is
there
anything
wrong
added
madeline
sitting
up
the
room
was
dark
as
pitch
but
a
faint
glow
seemed
to
mark
the
position
of
the
window
oh
nothing
much
replied
alfred
only
don
carlos
rancho
going
up
in
fire
cried
florence
sharply
you
think
so
when
you
see
it
hurry
out
majesty
old
girl
now
you
wo
have
to
tear
down
that
heap
of
adobe
as
you
threatened
i
believe
a
wall
will
stand
after
that
well
i
glad
of
it
said
madeline
a
good
healthy
fire
will
purify
the
atmosphere
over
there
and
save
me
expense
ugh
that
haunted
rancho
got
on
my
nerves
florence
i
do
believe
you
appropriated
part
of
my
does
alfred
have
lights
in
this
house
florence
laughingly
helped
madeline
to
dress
then
they
hurriedly
stumbled
over
chairs
and
passing
through
the
went
out
upon
the
porch
away
to
the
westward
low
down
along
the
horizon
she
saw
leaping
red
flames
and
columns
of
smoke
stillwell
appeared
greatly
perturbed
al
i
lookin
fer
that
ammunition
to
blow
up
he
said
there
was
enough
of
it
to
blow
the
roof
off
the
bill
surely
the
cowboys
would
get
that
stuff
out
the
first
thing
replied
alfred
anxiously
i
reckon
so
but
all
the
same
i
worryin
mebbe
there
was
time
supposin
thet
powder
went
off
as
the
boys
was
goin
fer
it
or
it
out
we
know
soon
if
the
explosion
does
come
quick
now
we
can
figger
the
boys
got
the
boxes
for
the
next
few
moments
there
was
a
silence
of
sustained
and
painful
suspense
florence
gripped
madeline
arm
madeline
felt
a
fullness
in
her
throat
and
a
rapid
beating
of
her
heart
presently
she
was
relieved
with
the
others
when
stillwell
declared
the
danger
of
an
explosion
needed
to
be
feared
no
longer
sure
you
can
gamble
on
gene
stewart
he
added
the
night
happened
to
be
partly
cloudy
with
broken
rifts
showing
the
moon
and
the
wind
blew
unusually
strong
the
brightness
of
the
fire
seemed
subdued
it
was
like
a
huge
bonfire
smothered
by
some
great
covering
penetrated
by
different
widely
separated
points
of
flame
these
corners
of
flame
flew
up
curling
in
the
wind
and
then
died
down
thus
the
scene
was
constantly
changing
from
dull
light
to
dark
there
came
a
moment
when
a
blacker
shade
overspread
the
wide
area
of
flickering
gleams
and
then
obliterated
them
night
enfolded
the
scene
the
moon
peeped
a
curved
yellow
rim
from
under
broken
clouds
to
all
appearances
the
fire
had
burned
itself
out
but
suddenly
a
pinpoint
of
light
showed
where
all
had
been
dense
black
it
grew
and
became
long
and
sharp
it
moved
it
had
life
it
leaped
up
its
color
warmed
from
white
to
red
then
from
all
about
it
burst
flame
on
flame
to
leap
into
a
great
changing
pillar
of
fire
that
climbed
high
and
higher
huge
funnels
of
smoke
yellow
black
white
all
tinged
with
the
color
of
fire
slanted
skyward
drifting
away
on
the
wind
wal
i
reckon
we
wo
hev
the
good
of
them
two
thousand
tons
of
alfalfa
we
was
figgerin
on
remarked
stillwell
ah
then
that
last
outbreak
of
fire
was
burning
hay
said
madeline
i
do
not
regret
the
rancho
but
it
too
bad
to
lose
such
a
quantity
of
good
feed
for
the
it
lost
an
no
mistake
the
fire
dyin
as
quick
as
she
flared
up
wal
i
hope
none
of
the
boys
got
risky
to
save
a
saddle
or
blanket
monty
he
hell
on
runnin
the
gantlet
of
fire
he
like
a
hoss
jest
been
dragged
out
of
a
burnin
stable
an
runs
back
sure
locoed
there
she
smolderin
down
now
reckon
might
jest
as
well
turn
in
again
it
only
three
i
wonder
how
the
fire
originated
remarked
alfred
some
careless
cowboy
cigarette
i
stillwell
rolled
out
his
laugh
al
you
sure
are
a
trustin
feller
i
some
doubtin
the
cigarette
idee
but
you
can
gamble
if
it
was
a
cigarette
it
belonged
to
a
cunnin
vaquero
an
was
dropped
now
bill
you
do
mean
don
carlos
burned
the
rancho
ejaculated
alfred
in
mingled
amaze
and
anger
again
the
old
cattleman
laughed
powerful
strange
to
say
my
friend
ole
bill
means
jest
of
course
don
carlos
set
that
fire
put
in
florence
with
spirit
al
if
you
live
out
heah
a
hundred
years
you
never
learn
that
greasers
are
treacherous
i
know
gene
stewart
suspected
something
underhand
that
why
he
wanted
us
to
hurry
away
that
why
he
put
me
on
the
black
horse
of
don
carlos
he
wants
that
horse
for
himself
and
feared
the
don
would
steal
or
shoot
him
and
you
bill
stillwell
you
as
bad
as
al
you
never
distrust
anybody
till
it
too
late
you
been
singing
ever
since
stewart
ordered
the
vaqueros
off
the
range
but
you
sure
have
been
wal
now
flo
you
need
pitch
into
me
jest
because
i
hev
a
natural
christian
spirit
replied
stillwell
much
aggrieved
i
reckon
hed
enough
trouble
in
my
life
so
not
to
go
lookin
fer
more
wal
sorry
about
the
hay
burnin
but
mebbe
the
boys
saved
the
stock
as
fer
that
ole
adobe
house
of
dark
holes
an
passages
so
long
miss
majesty
does
mind
i
darn
glad
it
burned
come
all
turn
in
again
somebody
ride
over
early
an
tell
us
what
madeline
awakened
early
but
not
so
early
as
the
others
who
were
up
and
had
breakfast
ready
when
she
went
into
the
stillwell
was
not
in
an
amiable
frame
of
mind
the
furrows
of
worry
lined
his
broad
brow
and
he
continually
glanced
at
his
watch
and
growled
because
the
cowboys
were
so
late
in
riding
over
with
the
news
he
gulped
his
breakfast
and
while
madeline
and
the
others
ate
theirs
he
tramped
up
and
down
the
porch
madeline
noted
that
alfred
grew
nervous
and
restless
presently
he
left
the
table
to
join
stillwell
outside
they
slope
off
to
don
carlos
rancho
and
leave
us
to
ride
home
alone
observed
florence
do
you
mind
questioned
madeline
no
i
do
exactly
mind
we
got
the
fastest
horses
in
this
country
i
like
to
run
that
big
black
devil
off
his
legs
no
i
do
mind
but
i
no
hankering
for
a
situation
gene
stewart
thinks
florence
began
disconnectedly
and
she
ended
evasively
madeline
did
not
press
the
point
although
she
had
some
sense
of
misgiving
stillwell
tramped
in
shaking
the
floor
with
his
huge
boots
alfred
followed
him
carrying
a
not
a
hoss
in
sight
complained
stillwell
wrong
over
don
carlos
way
miss
majesty
it
be
jest
as
well
fer
you
an
flo
to
hit
the
home
trail
we
can
telephone
over
an
see
that
the
boys
know
alfred
standing
in
the
door
swept
the
gray
valley
with
his
bill
i
see
running
or
cattle
i
ca
make
out
which
i
guess
we
better
rustle
over
both
men
hurried
out
and
while
the
horses
were
being
brought
up
and
saddled
madeline
and
florence
put
away
the
then
speedily
donned
spurs
sombreros
and
gauntlets
here
are
the
horses
ready
called
alfred
flo
that
black
mexican
horse
is
a
the
girls
went
out
in
time
to
hear
stillwell
as
he
mounted
and
spurred
away
alfred
went
through
the
motions
of
assisting
madeline
and
florence
to
mount
which
assistance
they
always
flouted
and
then
he
too
swung
up
astride
i
guess
it
all
right
he
said
rather
dubiously
you
really
must
not
go
over
toward
don
carlos
it
only
a
few
miles
sure
it
all
right
we
can
ride
ca
we
retorted
florence
better
have
a
care
for
yourself
going
off
over
there
to
mix
in
goodness
knows
alfred
said
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
away
if
bill
did
forget
to
telephone
exclaimed
florence
i
declare
he
and
al
were
sure
florence
dismounted
and
went
into
the
house
she
left
the
door
open
madeline
had
some
difficulty
in
holding
majesty
it
struck
madeline
that
florence
stayed
rather
long
indoors
presently
she
came
out
with
sober
face
and
rather
tight
lips
i
could
get
anybody
on
the
no
answer
i
tried
a
dozen
why
florence
madeline
was
more
concerned
by
the
girl
looks
than
by
the
information
she
imparted
the
wire
been
cut
said
florence
her
gray
glance
swept
swiftly
after
alfred
who
was
now
far
out
of
earshot
i
do
like
this
a
little
bit
heah
where
i
got
to
as
bill
she
pondered
a
moment
then
hurried
into
the
house
to
return
presently
with
the
that
alfred
had
used
with
this
she
took
a
survey
of
the
valley
particularly
in
the
direction
of
madeline
this
was
hidden
by
low
rolling
ridges
which
were
quite
close
by
anyway
nobody
in
that
direction
can
see
us
leave
heah
she
mused
there
mesquite
on
the
ridges
we
got
cover
long
enough
to
save
us
till
we
can
see
what
florence
what
what
do
you
expect
asked
madeline
nervously
i
do
know
there
never
any
telling
about
greasers
i
wish
bill
and
al
had
left
us
still
come
to
think
of
that
they
could
help
us
much
in
case
of
a
chase
we
run
right
away
from
them
besides
shoot
i
guess
i
as
well
as
satisfied
that
we
got
the
job
of
getting
home
on
our
own
hands
we
do
dare
follow
al
toward
don
carlos
ranch
we
know
there
trouble
over
there
so
all
that
left
is
to
hit
the
trail
for
home
come
let
ride
you
stick
like
a
spanish
needle
to
a
heavy
growth
of
mesquite
covered
the
top
of
the
first
ridge
and
the
trail
went
through
it
florence
took
the
lead
proceeding
cautiously
and
as
soon
as
she
could
see
over
the
summit
she
used
the
then
she
went
on
madeline
following
closely
saw
down
the
slope
of
the
ridge
to
a
bare
wide
grassy
hollow
and
onward
to
more
rolling
land
thick
with
cactus
and
mesquite
florence
appeared
cautious
deliberate
yet
she
lost
no
time
she
was
ominously
silent
madeline
misgivings
took
definite
shape
in
the
fear
of
vaqueros
in
ambush
upon
the
ascent
of
the
third
ridge
which
madeline
remembered
was
the
last
uneven
ground
between
the
point
she
had
reached
and
home
florence
exercised
even
more
guarded
care
in
advancing
before
she
reached
the
top
of
this
ridge
she
dismounted
looped
her
bridle
round
a
dead
snag
and
motioning
madeline
to
wait
she
slipped
ahead
through
the
mesquite
out
of
sight
madeline
waited
anxiously
listening
and
watching
certain
it
was
that
she
could
not
see
or
hear
anything
alarming
the
sun
began
to
have
a
touch
of
heat
the
morning
breeze
rustled
the
thin
mesquite
foliage
the
deep
magenta
of
a
cactus
flower
caught
her
eye
a
brown
bird
sailed
so
close
to
her
she
could
have
touched
it
with
her
whip
but
she
was
only
vaguely
aware
of
these
things
she
was
watching
for
florence
listening
for
some
sound
fraught
with
untoward
meaning
all
of
a
sudden
she
saw
majesty
ears
were
held
straight
up
then
florence
face
now
strangely
white
showed
round
the
turn
of
the
trail
whispered
florence
holding
up
a
warning
finger
she
reached
the
black
horse
and
petted
him
evidently
to
still
an
uneasiness
he
manifested
we
in
for
it
she
went
on
a
whole
bunch
of
vaqueros
hiding
among
the
mesquite
over
the
ridge
they
not
seen
or
heard
us
yet
we
better
risk
riding
ahead
cut
off
the
trail
and
beat
them
to
the
ranch
madeline
you
white
as
death
do
faint
now
i
shall
not
faint
but
you
frighten
me
is
there
danger
what
shall
we
do
there
danger
madeline
i
would
deceive
you
went
on
florence
in
an
earnest
whisper
things
have
turned
out
just
as
gene
stewart
hinted
oh
we
should
al
should
have
listened
to
gene
i
believe
i
afraid
gene
knew
knew
what
asked
madeline
never
mind
now
listen
we
dare
take
the
back
trail
we
go
on
i
a
scheme
to
fool
that
grinning
don
carlos
get
down
madeline
madeline
dismounted
give
me
your
white
sweater
take
it
off
and
that
white
hat
hurry
florence
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
cried
madeline
not
so
loud
whispered
the
other
her
gray
eyes
snapped
she
had
divested
herself
of
sombrero
and
jacket
which
she
held
out
to
madeline
heah
take
these
give
me
yours
then
get
up
on
the
black
i
ride
majesty
rustle
now
madeline
this
is
no
time
to
but
dear
why
why
do
you
want
ah
you
going
to
make
the
vaqueros
take
you
for
me
you
guessed
it
will
you
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
returned
madeline
it
was
then
that
florence
face
changing
took
on
the
hard
stern
sharpness
so
typical
of
a
cowboy
madeline
had
caught
glimpses
of
that
expression
in
alfred
face
and
on
stewart
when
he
was
silent
and
on
stillwell
always
it
was
a
look
of
iron
and
fire
unchangeable
unquenchable
will
there
was
even
much
of
violence
in
the
swift
action
whereby
florence
compelled
madeline
to
the
change
of
apparel
it
been
my
idea
anyhow
if
stewart
had
told
me
to
do
it
said
florence
her
words
as
swift
as
her
hands
don
carlos
is
after
you
you
miss
madeline
hammond
he
would
ambush
a
trail
for
any
one
else
he
not
killing
cowboys
these
days
he
wants
you
for
some
reason
so
gene
thought
and
now
i
believe
him
well
we
know
for
sure
in
five
minutes
you
ride
the
black
i
ride
majesty
we
slip
round
through
the
brush
out
of
sight
and
sound
till
we
can
break
out
into
the
open
then
we
split
you
make
straight
for
the
ranch
i
cut
loose
for
the
valley
where
gene
said
positively
the
cowboys
were
with
the
cattle
the
vaqueros
will
take
me
for
you
they
all
know
those
striking
white
things
you
wear
they
chase
me
they
never
get
anywhere
near
me
and
you
be
on
a
fast
horse
he
can
take
you
home
ahead
of
any
vaqueros
but
you
wo
be
chased
i
staking
all
on
that
trust
me
madeline
if
it
were
only
my
calculation
maybe
i
because
i
remember
stewart
that
cowboy
knows
things
come
this
the
safest
and
smartest
way
to
fool
don
madeline
felt
herself
more
forced
than
persuaded
into
acquiescence
she
mounted
the
black
and
took
up
the
bridle
in
another
moment
she
was
guiding
her
horse
off
the
trail
in
the
tracks
of
majesty
florence
led
off
at
right
angles
threading
a
slow
passage
through
the
mesquite
she
favored
sandy
patches
and
open
aisles
between
the
trees
and
was
careful
not
to
break
a
branch
often
she
stopped
to
listen
this
detour
of
perhaps
half
a
mile
brought
madeline
to
where
she
could
see
open
ground
the
only
a
few
miles
off
and
the
cattle
dotting
the
valley
she
had
not
lost
her
courage
but
it
was
certain
that
these
familiar
sights
somewhat
lightened
the
pressure
upon
her
breast
excitement
gripped
her
the
shrill
whistle
of
a
horse
made
both
the
black
and
majesty
jump
florence
quickened
the
gait
down
the
slope
soon
madeline
saw
the
edge
of
the
brush
the
grass
and
level
ground
florence
waited
at
the
opening
between
the
low
trees
she
gave
madeline
a
quick
bright
glance
all
over
but
the
ride
that
sure
be
easy
bolt
now
and
keep
your
nerve
when
florence
wheeled
the
fiery
roan
and
screamed
in
his
ear
madeline
seemed
suddenly
to
grow
lax
and
helpless
the
big
horse
leaped
into
thundering
action
this
was
memorable
of
bonita
of
the
flying
hair
and
the
wild
night
ride
florence
hair
streamed
on
the
wind
and
shone
gold
in
the
sunlight
yet
madeline
saw
her
with
the
same
thrill
with
which
she
had
seen
the
bonita
then
hoarse
shouts
unclamped
madeline
power
of
movement
and
she
spurred
the
black
into
the
open
he
wanted
to
run
and
he
was
swift
madeline
loosened
the
reins
laid
them
loose
upon
his
neck
his
action
was
strange
to
her
he
was
hard
to
ride
but
he
was
fast
and
she
cared
for
nothing
else
madeline
knew
horses
well
enough
to
realize
that
the
black
had
found
he
was
free
and
carrying
a
light
weight
a
few
times
she
took
up
the
bridle
and
pulled
to
right
or
left
trying
to
guide
him
he
kept
a
straight
course
however
and
crashed
through
small
patches
of
mesquite
and
jumped
the
cracks
and
washes
uneven
ground
offered
no
perceptible
obstacle
to
his
running
to
madeline
there
was
now
a
thrilling
difference
in
the
lash
of
wind
and
the
flash
of
the
gray
ground
underneath
she
was
running
away
from
something
what
that
was
she
did
not
know
but
she
remembered
florence
and
she
wanted
to
look
back
yet
hated
to
do
so
for
fear
of
the
nameless
danger
florence
had
mentioned
madeline
listened
for
the
pounding
of
pursuing
hoofs
in
her
rear
involuntarily
she
glanced
back
on
the
mile
or
more
of
gray
level
between
her
and
the
ridge
there
was
not
a
horse
a
man
or
anything
living
she
wheeled
to
look
back
on
the
other
side
down
the
valley
slope
the
sight
of
florence
riding
majesty
in
zigzag
flight
before
a
whole
troop
of
vaqueros
blanched
madeline
cheek
and
made
her
grip
the
pommel
of
her
saddle
in
terror
that
strange
gait
of
her
roan
was
not
his
wonderful
stride
could
majesty
be
running
wild
madeline
saw
one
vaquero
draw
closer
whirling
his
lasso
round
his
head
but
he
did
not
get
near
enough
to
throw
so
it
seemed
to
madeline
another
vaquero
swept
across
in
front
of
the
first
one
then
when
madeline
gasped
in
breathless
expectancy
the
roan
swerved
to
elude
the
attack
it
flashed
over
madeline
that
florence
was
putting
the
horse
to
some
such
awkward
flight
as
might
have
been
expected
of
an
eastern
girl
frightened
out
of
her
wits
madeline
made
sure
of
this
when
after
looking
again
she
saw
that
florence
in
spite
of
the
horse
breaking
gait
and
the
irregular
course
was
drawing
slowly
and
surely
down
the
valley
madeline
had
not
lost
her
head
to
the
extent
of
forgetting
her
own
mount
and
the
nature
of
the
ground
in
front
when
presently
she
turned
again
to
watch
florence
uncertainty
ceased
in
her
mind
the
strange
features
of
that
race
between
girl
and
vaqueros
were
no
longer
in
evidence
majesty
was
in
his
beautiful
wonderful
stride
low
down
along
the
ground
stretching
with
his
nose
level
and
straight
for
the
valley
between
him
and
the
lean
horses
in
pursuit
lay
an
space
he
was
running
away
from
the
vaqueros
florence
was
indeed
riding
the
wind
as
stewart
had
aptly
expressed
his
idea
of
flight
upon
the
fleet
roan
a
dimness
came
over
madeline
eyes
and
it
was
not
all
owing
to
the
sting
of
the
wind
she
rubbed
it
away
seeing
florence
as
a
flying
dot
in
a
strange
blur
what
a
daring
intrepid
girl
this
kind
of
strength
and
aye
splendid
thought
for
a
weaker
sister
was
what
the
west
inculcated
in
a
woman
the
next
time
madeline
looked
back
florence
was
far
ahead
of
her
pursuers
and
going
out
of
sight
behind
a
low
knoll
assured
of
florence
safety
madeline
put
her
mind
to
her
own
ride
and
the
possibilities
awaiting
at
the
ranch
she
remembered
the
failure
to
get
any
of
her
servants
or
cowboys
on
the
telephone
to
be
sure
a
had
once
broken
the
wire
but
she
had
little
real
hope
of
such
being
the
case
in
this
instance
she
rode
on
pulling
the
black
as
she
neared
the
ranch
her
approach
was
from
the
south
and
off
the
usual
trail
so
that
she
went
up
the
long
slope
of
the
knoll
toward
the
back
of
the
house
under
these
circumstances
she
could
not
consider
it
out
of
the
ordinary
that
she
did
not
see
any
one
about
the
grounds
it
was
perhaps
fortunate
for
her
she
thought
that
the
climb
up
the
slope
cut
the
black
speed
so
she
could
manage
him
he
was
not
very
hard
to
stop
the
moment
she
dismounted
however
he
jumped
and
trotted
off
at
the
edge
of
the
slope
facing
the
corrals
he
halted
to
lift
his
head
and
shoot
up
his
ears
then
he
let
out
a
piercing
whistle
and
dashed
down
the
lane
madeline
prepared
by
that
warning
whistle
tried
to
fortify
herself
for
a
new
and
unexpected
situation
but
as
she
espied
an
unfamiliar
company
of
horsemen
rapidly
riding
down
a
hollow
leading
from
the
foothills
she
felt
the
return
of
fears
gripping
at
her
like
cold
hands
and
she
fled
precipitously
into
the
house
xi
a
band
of
guerrillas
madeline
bolted
the
door
and
flying
into
the
kitchen
she
told
the
scared
servants
to
shut
themselves
in
then
she
ran
to
her
own
rooms
it
was
only
a
matter
of
a
few
moments
for
her
to
close
and
bar
the
heavy
shutters
yet
even
as
she
was
fastening
the
last
one
in
the
room
she
used
as
an
office
a
clattering
roar
of
hoofs
seemed
to
swell
up
to
the
front
of
the
house
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
wild
shaggy
horses
and
ragged
dusty
men
she
had
never
seen
any
vaqueros
that
resembled
these
horsemen
vaqueros
had
grace
and
style
they
were
fond
of
lace
and
glitter
and
fringe
they
dressed
their
horses
in
silvered
trappings
but
the
riders
now
trampling
into
the
driveway
were
uncouth
lean
savage
they
were
guerrillas
a
band
of
the
raiders
who
had
been
harassing
the
border
since
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
a
second
glimpse
assured
madeline
that
they
were
not
all
mexicans
the
presence
of
outlaws
in
that
band
brought
home
to
madeline
her
real
danger
she
remembered
what
stillwell
had
told
her
about
recent
outlaw
raids
along
the
rio
grande
these
flying
bands
operating
under
the
excitement
of
the
revolution
appeared
here
and
there
everywhere
in
remote
places
and
were
gone
as
quickly
as
they
came
mostly
they
wanted
money
and
arms
but
they
would
steal
anything
and
unprotected
women
had
suffered
at
their
hands
madeline
hurriedly
collecting
her
securities
and
the
considerable
money
she
had
in
her
desk
ran
out
closed
and
locked
the
door
crossed
the
patio
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
house
and
entering
again
went
down
a
long
corridor
trying
to
decide
which
of
the
many
unused
rooms
would
be
best
to
hide
in
and
before
she
made
up
her
mind
she
came
to
the
last
room
just
then
a
battering
on
door
or
window
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
and
shrill
screams
from
the
servant
women
increased
alarm
she
entered
the
last
room
there
was
no
lock
or
bar
upon
the
door
but
the
room
was
large
and
dark
and
it
was
half
full
of
bales
of
alfalfa
hay
probably
it
was
the
safest
place
in
the
house
at
least
time
would
be
necessary
to
find
any
one
hidden
there
she
dropped
her
valuables
in
a
dark
corner
and
covered
them
with
loose
hay
that
done
she
felt
her
way
down
a
narrow
aisle
between
the
bales
and
presently
crouched
in
a
niche
with
the
necessity
of
action
over
for
the
immediate
present
madeline
became
conscious
that
she
was
quivering
and
almost
breathless
her
skin
felt
tight
and
cold
there
was
a
weight
on
her
chest
her
mouth
was
dry
and
she
had
a
strange
tendency
to
swallow
her
listening
faculty
seemed
most
acute
dull
sounds
came
from
parts
of
the
house
remote
from
her
in
the
intervals
of
silence
between
these
sounds
she
heard
the
squeaking
and
rustling
of
mice
in
the
hay
a
mouse
ran
over
her
hand
she
listened
waiting
hoping
yet
dreading
to
hear
the
clattering
approach
of
her
cowboys
there
would
be
fighting
blood
men
injured
perhaps
killed
even
the
thought
of
violence
of
any
kind
hurt
her
but
perhaps
the
guerrillas
would
run
in
time
to
avoid
a
clash
with
her
men
she
hoped
for
that
prayed
for
it
through
her
mind
flitted
what
she
knew
of
nels
of
monty
of
nick
steele
and
she
experienced
a
sensation
that
left
her
somewhat
chilled
and
sick
then
she
thought
of
the
stewart
she
felt
a
thrill
drive
away
the
cold
nausea
and
her
excitement
augmented
waiting
listening
increased
all
her
emotions
nothing
appeared
to
be
happening
yet
hours
seemed
to
pass
while
she
crouched
there
had
florence
been
overtaken
could
any
of
those
lean
horses
outrun
majesty
she
doubted
it
she
knew
it
could
not
be
true
nevertheless
the
strain
of
uncertainty
was
torturing
suddenly
the
bang
of
the
corridor
door
pierced
her
through
and
through
with
the
dread
of
uncertainty
some
of
the
guerrillas
had
entered
the
east
wing
of
the
house
she
heard
a
babel
of
jabbering
voices
the
shuffling
of
boots
and
clinking
of
spurs
the
slamming
of
doors
and
ransacking
of
rooms
madeline
lost
faith
in
her
moreover
she
found
it
impossible
to
take
the
chance
the
idea
of
being
caught
in
that
dark
room
by
those
ruffians
filled
her
with
horror
she
must
get
out
into
the
light
swiftly
she
rose
and
went
to
the
window
it
was
rather
more
of
a
door
than
window
being
a
large
aperture
closed
by
two
wooden
doors
on
hinges
the
iron
hook
yielded
readily
to
her
grasp
and
one
door
stuck
fast
while
the
other
opened
a
few
inches
she
looked
out
upon
a
green
slope
covered
with
flowers
and
bunches
of
sage
and
bushes
neither
man
nor
horse
showed
in
the
narrow
field
of
her
vision
she
believed
she
would
be
safer
hidden
out
there
in
the
shrubbery
than
in
the
house
the
jump
from
the
window
would
be
easy
for
her
and
with
her
quick
decision
came
a
rush
and
stir
of
spirit
that
warded
off
her
weakness
she
pulled
at
the
door
it
did
not
budge
it
had
caught
at
the
bottom
pulling
with
all
her
might
proved
to
be
in
vain
pausing
with
palms
hot
and
bruised
she
heard
a
louder
closer
approach
of
the
invaders
of
her
home
fear
wrath
and
impotence
contested
for
supremacy
over
her
and
drove
her
to
desperation
she
was
alone
here
and
she
must
rely
on
herself
and
as
she
strained
every
muscle
to
move
that
obstinate
door
and
heard
the
quick
harsh
voices
of
men
and
the
sounds
of
a
hurried
search
she
suddenly
felt
sure
that
they
were
hunting
for
her
she
knew
it
she
did
not
wonder
at
it
but
she
wondered
if
she
were
really
madeline
hammond
and
if
it
were
possible
that
brutal
men
would
harm
her
then
the
tramping
of
heavy
feet
on
the
floor
of
the
adjoining
room
lent
her
the
last
strength
of
fear
pushing
with
hands
and
shoulders
she
moved
the
door
far
enough
to
permit
the
passage
of
her
body
then
she
stepped
up
on
the
sill
and
slipped
through
the
aperture
she
saw
no
one
lightly
she
jumped
down
and
ran
in
among
the
bushes
but
these
did
not
afford
her
the
cover
she
needed
she
stole
from
one
clump
to
another
finding
too
late
that
she
had
chosen
with
poor
judgment
the
position
of
the
bushes
had
drawn
her
closer
to
the
front
of
the
house
rather
than
away
from
it
and
just
before
her
were
horses
and
beyond
a
group
of
excited
men
with
her
heart
in
her
throat
madeline
crouched
down
a
shrill
yell
followed
by
running
and
mounting
guerrillas
roused
her
hope
they
had
sighted
the
cowboys
and
were
in
flight
rapid
thumping
of
boots
on
the
porch
told
of
men
hurrying
from
the
house
several
horses
dashed
past
her
not
ten
feet
distant
one
rider
saw
her
for
he
turned
to
shout
back
this
drove
madeline
into
a
panic
hardly
knowing
what
she
did
she
began
to
run
away
from
the
house
her
feet
seemed
leaden
she
felt
the
same
horrible
powerlessness
that
sometimes
came
over
her
when
she
dreamed
of
being
pursued
horses
with
shouting
riders
streaked
past
her
in
the
shrubbery
there
was
a
thunder
of
hoofs
behind
her
she
turned
aside
but
the
thundering
grew
nearer
she
was
being
run
down
as
madeline
shut
her
eyes
and
staggering
was
about
to
fall
apparently
right
under
pounding
hoofs
a
rude
powerful
hand
clapped
round
her
waist
clutched
deep
and
strong
and
swung
her
aloft
she
felt
a
heavy
blow
when
the
shoulder
of
the
horse
struck
her
and
then
a
wrenching
of
her
arm
as
she
was
dragged
up
a
sudden
blighting
pain
made
sight
and
feeling
fade
from
her
but
she
did
not
become
unconscious
to
the
extent
that
she
lost
the
sense
of
being
rapidly
borne
away
she
seemed
to
hold
that
for
a
long
time
when
her
faculties
began
to
return
the
motion
of
the
horse
was
no
longer
violent
for
a
few
moments
she
could
not
determine
her
position
apparently
she
was
upside
down
then
she
saw
that
she
was
facing
the
ground
and
must
be
lying
across
a
saddle
with
her
head
hanging
down
she
could
not
move
a
hand
she
could
not
tell
where
her
hands
were
then
she
felt
the
touch
of
soft
leather
she
saw
a
mexican
boot
wearing
a
huge
silver
spur
and
the
reeking
flank
and
legs
of
a
horse
and
a
dusty
narrow
trail
soon
a
kind
of
red
darkness
veiled
her
eyes
her
head
swam
and
she
felt
motion
and
pain
only
dully
after
what
seemed
a
thousand
weary
hours
some
one
lifted
her
from
the
horse
and
laid
her
upon
the
ground
where
gradually
as
the
blood
left
her
head
and
she
could
see
she
began
to
get
the
right
relation
of
things
she
lay
in
a
sparse
grove
of
firs
and
the
shadows
told
of
late
afternoon
she
smelled
wood
smoke
and
she
heard
the
sharp
crunch
of
horses
teeth
nipping
grass
voices
caused
her
to
turn
her
face
a
group
of
men
stood
and
sat
round
a
eating
like
wolves
the
looks
of
her
captors
made
madeline
close
her
eyes
and
the
fascination
the
fear
they
roused
in
her
made
her
open
them
again
mostly
they
were
mexicans
black
and
haggard
and
starved
whatever
they
might
be
they
surely
were
and
squalid
not
one
had
a
coat
a
few
had
scarfs
some
wore
belts
in
which
were
scattered
cartridges
only
a
few
had
guns
and
these
were
of
diverse
patterns
madeline
could
see
no
packs
no
blankets
and
only
a
few
all
battered
and
blackened
her
eyes
fastened
upon
men
she
believed
were
white
men
but
it
was
from
their
features
and
not
their
color
that
she
judged
once
she
had
seen
a
band
of
nomad
robbers
in
the
sahara
and
somehow
was
reminded
of
them
by
this
motley
outlaw
troop
they
divided
attention
between
the
satisfying
of
ravenous
appetites
and
a
vigilant
watching
down
the
forest
aisles
they
expected
some
one
madeline
thought
and
manifestly
if
it
were
a
pursuing
posse
they
did
not
show
anxiety
she
could
not
understand
more
than
a
word
here
and
there
that
they
uttered
presently
however
the
name
of
don
carlos
revived
keen
curiosity
in
her
and
realization
of
her
situation
and
then
once
more
dread
possessed
her
breast
a
low
exclamation
and
a
sweep
of
arm
from
one
of
the
guerrillas
caused
the
whole
band
to
wheel
and
concentrate
their
attention
in
the
opposite
direction
they
heard
something
they
saw
some
one
grimy
hands
sought
weapons
and
then
every
man
stiffened
madeline
saw
what
hunted
men
looked
like
at
the
moment
of
discovery
and
the
sight
was
terrible
she
closed
her
eyes
sick
with
what
she
saw
fearful
of
the
moment
when
the
guns
would
leap
out
there
were
muttered
curses
a
short
period
of
silence
followed
by
whisperings
and
then
a
clear
voice
rang
out
el
capitan
a
strong
shock
vibrated
through
madeline
and
her
eyelids
swept
open
instantly
she
associated
the
name
el
capitan
with
stewart
and
experienced
a
sensation
of
strange
regret
it
was
not
pursuit
or
rescue
she
thought
of
then
but
death
these
men
would
kill
stewart
but
surely
he
had
not
come
alone
the
lean
dark
faces
corded
and
rigid
told
her
in
what
direction
to
look
she
heard
the
slow
heavy
thump
of
hoofs
soon
into
the
wide
aisle
between
the
trees
moved
the
form
of
a
man
arms
flung
high
over
his
head
then
madeline
saw
the
horse
and
she
recognized
majesty
and
she
knew
it
was
really
stewart
who
rode
the
roan
when
doubt
was
no
longer
possible
she
felt
a
suffocating
sense
of
gladness
and
fear
and
wonder
many
of
the
guerrillas
leaped
up
with
drawn
weapons
still
stewart
approached
with
his
hands
high
and
he
rode
right
into
the
circle
then
a
guerrilla
evidently
the
chief
waved
down
the
threatening
men
and
strode
up
to
stewart
he
greeted
him
there
was
amaze
and
pleasure
and
respect
in
the
greeting
madeline
could
tell
that
though
she
did
not
know
what
was
said
at
the
moment
stewart
appeared
to
her
as
cool
and
careless
as
if
he
were
dismounting
at
her
porch
steps
but
when
he
got
down
she
saw
that
his
face
was
white
he
shook
hands
with
the
guerrilla
and
then
his
glittering
eyes
roved
over
the
men
and
around
the
glade
until
they
rested
upon
madeline
without
moving
from
his
tracks
he
seemed
to
leap
as
if
a
powerful
current
had
shocked
him
madeline
tried
to
smile
to
assure
him
she
was
alive
and
well
but
the
intent
in
his
eyes
the
power
of
his
controlled
spirit
telling
her
of
her
peril
and
his
froze
the
smile
on
her
lips
with
that
he
faced
the
chief
and
spoke
rapidly
in
the
mexican
jargon
madeline
had
always
found
so
difficult
to
translate
the
chief
answered
spreading
wide
his
hands
one
of
which
indicated
madeline
as
she
lay
there
stewart
drew
the
fellow
a
little
aside
and
said
something
for
his
ear
alone
the
chief
hands
swept
up
in
a
gesture
of
surprise
and
acquiescence
again
stewart
spoke
swiftly
his
hearer
then
turned
to
address
the
band
madeline
caught
the
words
don
carlos
and
there
was
a
brief
muttering
protest
which
the
chief
thundered
down
madeline
guessed
her
release
had
been
given
by
this
guerrilla
and
bought
from
the
others
of
the
band
stewart
strode
to
her
side
leading
the
roan
majesty
reared
and
snorted
when
he
saw
his
mistress
prostrate
stewart
knelt
still
holding
the
bridle
are
you
all
right
he
asked
i
think
so
she
replied
essaying
a
laugh
that
was
rather
a
failure
my
feet
are
dark
blood
blotted
out
all
the
white
from
his
face
and
lightning
shot
from
his
eyes
she
felt
his
hands
like
steel
tongs
loosening
the
bonds
round
her
ankles
without
a
word
he
lifted
her
upright
and
then
upon
majesty
madeline
reeled
a
little
in
the
saddle
held
hard
to
the
pommel
with
one
hand
and
tried
to
lean
on
stewart
shoulder
with
the
other
do
give
up
he
said
she
saw
him
gaze
furtively
into
the
forest
on
all
sides
and
it
surprised
her
to
see
the
guerrillas
riding
away
putting
the
two
facts
together
madeline
formed
an
idea
that
neither
stewart
nor
the
others
desired
to
meet
with
some
one
evidently
due
shortly
in
the
glade
stewart
guided
the
roan
off
to
the
right
and
walked
beside
madeline
steadying
her
in
the
saddle
at
first
madeline
was
so
weak
and
dizzy
that
she
could
scarcely
retain
her
seat
the
dizziness
left
her
presently
and
then
she
made
an
effort
to
ride
without
help
her
weakness
however
and
a
pain
in
her
wrenched
arm
made
the
task
laborsome
stewart
had
struck
off
the
trail
if
there
were
one
and
was
keeping
to
denser
parts
of
the
forest
the
sun
sank
low
and
the
shafts
of
gold
fell
with
a
long
slant
among
the
firs
majesty
hoofs
made
no
sound
on
the
soft
ground
and
stewart
strode
on
without
speaking
neither
his
hurry
nor
vigilance
relaxed
until
at
least
two
miles
had
been
covered
then
he
held
to
a
straighter
course
and
did
not
send
so
many
glances
into
the
darkening
woods
the
level
of
the
forest
began
to
be
cut
up
by
little
hollows
all
of
which
sloped
and
widened
presently
the
soft
ground
gave
place
to
bare
rocky
soil
the
horse
snorted
and
tossed
his
head
a
sound
of
splashing
water
broke
the
silence
the
hollow
opened
into
a
wider
one
through
which
a
little
brook
murmured
its
way
over
the
stones
majesty
snorted
again
and
stopped
and
bent
his
head
he
wants
a
drink
said
madeline
i
thirsty
too
and
very
stewart
lifted
her
out
of
the
saddle
and
as
their
hands
parted
she
felt
something
moist
and
warm
blood
was
running
down
her
arm
and
into
the
palm
of
her
hand
i
bleeding
she
said
a
little
unsteadily
oh
i
remember
my
arm
was
she
held
it
out
the
blood
making
her
conscious
of
her
weakness
stewart
fingers
felt
so
firm
and
sure
swiftly
he
ripped
the
wet
sleeve
her
forearm
had
been
cut
or
scratched
he
washed
off
the
blood
why
stewart
it
nothing
i
was
only
a
little
nervous
i
guess
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
my
own
he
made
no
reply
as
he
tore
her
handkerchief
into
strips
and
bound
her
arm
his
swift
motions
and
his
silence
gave
her
a
hint
of
how
he
might
meet
a
more
serious
emergency
she
felt
safe
and
because
of
that
impression
when
he
lifted
his
head
and
she
saw
that
he
was
pale
and
shaking
she
was
surprised
he
stood
before
her
folding
his
scarf
which
was
still
wet
and
from
which
he
made
no
effort
to
remove
the
red
stains
miss
hammond
he
said
hoarsely
it
was
a
man
hands
a
that
cut
your
arm
i
know
who
he
was
i
could
have
killed
him
but
i
might
have
got
your
freedom
you
understand
i
madeline
gazed
at
stewart
astounded
more
by
his
speech
than
his
excessive
emotion
my
dear
boy
she
exclaimed
and
then
she
paused
she
could
not
find
words
he
was
making
an
apology
to
her
for
not
killing
a
man
who
had
laid
a
rough
hand
upon
her
person
he
was
ashamed
and
seemed
to
be
in
a
torture
that
she
would
not
understand
why
he
had
not
killed
the
man
there
seemed
to
be
something
of
passionate
scorn
in
him
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
avenge
her
as
well
as
free
her
stewart
i
understand
you
were
being
my
kind
of
cowboy
i
thank
but
she
did
not
understand
so
much
as
she
implied
she
had
heard
many
stories
of
this
man
cool
indifference
to
peril
and
death
he
had
always
seemed
as
hard
as
granite
why
should
the
sight
of
a
little
blood
upon
her
arm
pale
his
cheek
and
shake
his
hand
and
thicken
his
voice
what
was
there
in
his
nature
to
make
him
implore
her
to
see
the
only
reason
he
could
not
kill
an
outlaw
the
answer
to
the
first
question
was
that
he
loved
her
it
was
beyond
her
to
answer
the
second
but
the
secret
of
it
lay
in
the
same
strength
from
which
his
love
sprang
an
intensity
of
feeling
which
seemed
characteristic
of
these
western
men
of
simple
lonely
elemental
lives
all
at
once
over
madeline
rushed
a
tide
of
realization
of
how
greatly
it
was
possible
for
such
a
man
as
stewart
to
love
her
the
thought
came
to
her
in
all
its
singular
power
all
her
eastern
lovers
who
had
the
graces
that
made
them
her
equals
in
the
sight
of
the
world
were
without
the
only
great
essential
that
a
lonely
hard
life
had
given
to
stewart
nature
here
struck
a
just
balance
something
deep
and
dim
in
the
future
an
unknown
voice
called
to
madeline
and
disturbed
her
and
because
it
was
not
a
voice
to
her
intelligence
she
deadened
the
ears
of
her
warm
and
throbbing
life
and
decided
never
to
listen
is
it
safe
to
rest
a
little
she
asked
i
am
so
tired
perhaps
be
stronger
if
i
we
all
right
now
he
said
the
horse
will
be
better
too
i
ran
him
out
and
uphill
at
where
are
we
up
in
the
mountains
ten
miles
and
more
from
the
ranch
there
a
trail
just
below
here
i
can
get
you
home
by
midnight
they
be
some
worried
down
what
happened
nothing
much
to
any
one
but
you
that
the
the
hard
luck
of
it
florence
caught
us
out
on
the
slope
we
were
returning
from
the
fire
we
were
dead
beat
but
we
got
to
the
ranch
before
any
damage
was
done
we
sure
had
trouble
in
finding
a
trace
of
you
nick
spotted
the
prints
of
your
heels
under
the
window
and
then
we
knew
i
had
to
fight
the
boys
if
they
come
after
you
we
never
have
gotten
you
without
a
fight
i
did
want
that
old
bill
came
out
packing
a
dozen
guns
he
was
crazy
i
had
to
rope
monty
honest
i
tied
him
to
the
porch
nels
and
nick
promised
to
stay
and
hold
him
till
morning
that
was
the
best
i
could
do
i
was
sure
lucky
to
come
up
with
the
band
so
soon
i
had
figured
right
i
knew
that
guerrilla
chief
he
a
bandit
in
mexico
it
a
business
with
him
but
he
fought
for
madero
and
i
was
with
him
a
good
deal
he
may
be
a
greaser
but
he
how
did
you
effect
my
release
i
offered
them
money
that
what
the
rebels
all
want
they
need
money
they
a
lot
of
poor
hungry
i
gathered
that
you
offered
to
pay
ransom
how
much
two
thousand
dollars
mex
i
gave
my
word
i
have
to
take
the
money
i
told
them
when
and
where
i
meet
certainly
i
glad
i
got
the
madeline
laughed
what
a
strange
thing
to
happen
to
me
i
wonder
what
dad
would
say
to
that
stewart
i
afraid
he
say
two
thousand
dollars
is
more
than
worth
but
tell
me
that
rebel
chieftain
did
not
demand
money
no
the
money
is
for
his
what
did
you
say
to
him
i
saw
you
whisper
in
his
stewart
dropped
his
head
averting
her
direct
gaze
we
were
comrades
before
juarez
one
day
i
dragged
him
out
of
a
ditch
i
reminded
him
then
i
i
told
him
something
i
i
thought
stewart
i
know
from
the
way
he
looked
at
me
that
you
spoke
of
her
companion
did
not
offer
a
reply
to
this
and
madeline
did
not
press
the
point
i
heard
don
carlos
name
several
times
that
interests
me
what
have
don
carlos
and
his
vaqueros
to
do
with
this
that
greaser
has
all
to
do
with
it
replied
stewart
grimly
he
burned
his
ranch
and
corrals
to
keep
us
from
getting
them
but
he
also
did
it
to
draw
all
the
boys
away
from
your
home
they
had
a
deep
plot
all
right
i
left
orders
for
some
one
to
stay
with
you
but
al
and
stillwell
who
both
rode
off
this
morning
then
the
guerrillas
came
well
what
was
the
idea
the
plot
as
you
call
it
to
get
you
he
said
bluntly
me
stewart
you
do
not
mean
my
capture
whatever
you
call
it
was
anything
more
than
mere
accident
i
do
mean
that
but
stillwell
and
your
brother
think
the
guerrillas
wanted
money
and
arms
and
they
just
happened
to
make
off
with
you
because
you
ran
under
a
horse
you
do
not
incline
to
that
point
of
view
i
do
neither
does
nels
nor
nick
steele
and
we
know
don
carlos
and
the
greasers
look
how
the
vaqueros
chased
flo
for
you
what
do
you
think
then
i
rather
not
but
stewart
i
would
like
to
know
if
it
is
about
me
surely
i
ought
to
know
protested
madeline
what
reason
have
nels
and
nick
to
suspect
don
carlos
of
plotting
to
abduct
me
i
suppose
they
no
reason
you
take
once
i
heard
nels
say
he
seen
the
greaser
look
at
you
and
if
he
ever
saw
him
do
it
again
he
shoot
why
stewart
that
is
ridiculous
to
shoot
a
man
for
looking
at
a
woman
this
is
a
civilized
well
maybe
it
would
be
ridiculous
in
a
civilized
country
there
some
things
about
civilization
i
do
care
what
for
instance
for
one
thing
i
ca
stand
for
the
way
men
let
other
men
treat
but
stewart
this
is
strange
talk
from
you
who
that
night
i
came
she
broke
off
sorry
that
she
had
spoken
his
shame
was
not
pleasant
to
see
suddenly
he
lifted
his
head
and
she
felt
scorched
by
flaming
eyes
suppose
i
was
drunk
suppose
i
had
met
some
ordinary
girl
suppose
i
had
really
made
her
marry
me
do
you
think
i
would
have
stopped
being
a
drunkard
and
have
been
good
to
her
stewart
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
about
you
replied
madeline
then
followed
a
short
silence
madeline
saw
the
last
bright
rays
of
the
setting
sun
glide
up
over
a
distant
crag
stewart
rebridled
the
horse
and
looked
at
the
i
got
off
the
trail
about
don
carlos
i
say
right
out
not
what
nels
and
nick
think
but
what
i
know
don
carlos
hoped
to
make
off
with
you
for
himself
the
same
as
if
you
had
been
a
poor
peon
down
in
sonora
maybe
he
had
a
deeper
plot
than
my
rebel
friend
told
me
maybe
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
hope
for
american
troops
to
chase
him
the
rebels
are
trying
to
stir
up
the
united
states
they
welcome
intervention
but
however
that
may
be
the
greaser
meant
evil
to
you
and
has
meant
it
ever
since
he
saw
you
first
that
stewart
you
have
done
me
and
my
family
a
service
we
can
never
hope
to
i
done
the
service
only
do
mention
pay
to
me
but
there
one
thing
i
like
you
to
know
and
i
find
it
hard
to
say
it
prompted
maybe
by
what
i
know
you
think
of
me
and
what
i
imagine
your
family
and
friends
would
think
if
they
knew
it
not
prompted
by
pride
or
conceit
and
it
this
such
a
woman
as
you
should
never
have
come
to
this
country
unless
she
meant
to
forget
herself
but
as
you
did
come
and
as
you
were
dragged
away
by
those
devils
i
want
you
to
know
that
all
your
wealth
and
position
and
influence
all
that
power
behind
you
would
never
have
saved
you
from
hell
only
such
a
man
as
nels
or
nick
steele
or
i
could
have
done
madeline
hammond
felt
the
great
leveling
force
of
the
truth
whatever
the
difference
between
her
and
stewart
or
whatever
the
imagined
difference
set
up
by
false
standards
of
class
and
culture
the
truth
was
that
here
on
this
wild
she
was
only
a
woman
and
he
was
simply
a
man
it
was
a
man
that
she
needed
and
if
her
choice
could
have
been
considered
in
this
extremity
it
would
have
fallen
upon
him
who
had
just
faced
her
in
quiet
bitter
speech
here
was
food
for
thought
i
reckon
we
better
start
now
he
said
and
drew
the
horse
close
to
a
large
rock
madeline
will
greatly
exceeded
her
strength
for
the
first
time
she
acknowledged
to
herself
that
she
had
been
hurt
still
she
did
not
feel
much
pain
except
when
she
moved
her
shoulder
once
in
the
saddle
where
stewart
lifted
her
she
drooped
weakly
the
way
was
rough
every
step
the
horse
took
hurt
her
and
the
slope
of
the
ground
threw
her
forward
on
the
pommel
presently
as
the
slope
grew
rockier
and
her
discomfort
increased
she
forgot
everything
except
that
she
was
suffering
here
is
the
trail
said
stewart
at
length
not
far
from
that
point
madeline
swayed
and
but
for
stewart
support
would
have
fallen
from
the
saddle
she
heard
him
swear
under
his
breath
here
this
wo
do
he
said
throw
your
leg
over
the
pommel
the
other
one
then
mounting
he
slipped
behind
her
and
lifted
and
turned
her
and
then
held
her
with
his
left
arm
so
that
she
lay
across
the
saddle
and
his
knees
her
head
against
his
shoulder
as
the
horse
started
into
a
rapid
walk
madeline
gradually
lost
all
pain
and
discomfort
when
she
relaxed
her
muscles
presently
she
let
herself
go
and
lay
inert
greatly
to
her
relief
for
a
little
while
she
seemed
to
be
half
drunk
with
the
gentle
swaying
of
a
hammock
her
mind
became
at
once
dreamy
and
active
as
if
it
thoughtfully
recorded
the
slow
soft
impressions
pouring
in
from
all
her
senses
a
red
glow
faded
in
the
west
she
could
see
out
over
the
foothills
where
twilight
was
settling
gray
on
the
crests
dark
in
the
hollows
cedar
and
pinyon
trees
lined
the
trail
and
there
were
no
more
firs
at
intervals
huge
rocks
loomed
over
her
the
sky
was
clear
and
steely
a
faint
star
twinkled
and
lastly
close
to
her
she
saw
stewart
face
once
more
dark
and
impassive
with
the
inscrutable
eyes
fixed
on
the
trail
his
arm
like
a
band
of
iron
held
her
yet
it
was
flexible
and
yielded
her
to
the
motion
of
the
horse
one
instant
she
felt
the
brawn
the
bone
heavy
and
powerful
the
next
the
stretch
and
ripple
the
elasticity
of
muscles
he
held
her
as
easily
as
if
she
were
a
child
the
roughness
of
his
flannel
shirt
rubbed
her
cheek
and
beneath
that
she
felt
the
dampness
of
the
scarf
he
had
used
to
bathe
her
arm
and
deeper
still
the
regular
pound
of
his
heart
against
her
ear
filling
it
with
strong
vibrant
beat
his
heart
seemed
a
mighty
engine
deep
within
a
great
cavern
her
head
had
never
before
rested
on
a
man
breast
and
she
had
no
liking
for
it
there
but
she
felt
more
than
the
physical
contact
the
position
was
mysterious
and
fascinating
and
something
natural
in
it
made
her
think
of
life
then
as
the
cool
wind
blew
down
from
the
heights
loosening
her
tumbled
hair
she
was
compelled
to
see
strands
of
it
curl
softly
into
stewart
face
before
his
eyes
across
his
lips
she
was
unable
to
reach
it
with
her
free
hand
and
therefore
could
not
refasten
it
and
when
she
shut
her
eyes
she
felt
those
loosened
strands
playing
against
his
cheeks
in
the
keener
press
of
such
sensations
she
caught
the
smell
of
dust
and
a
faint
wild
sweet
tang
on
the
air
there
was
a
low
rustling
sigh
of
wind
in
the
brush
along
the
trail
suddenly
the
silence
ripped
apart
to
the
sharp
bark
of
a
coyote
and
then
from
far
away
came
a
long
wail
and
then
majesty
hoof
rang
on
a
stone
these
later
things
lent
probability
to
that
ride
for
madeline
otherwise
it
would
have
seemed
like
a
dream
even
so
it
was
hard
to
believe
again
she
wondered
if
this
woman
who
had
begun
to
think
and
feel
so
much
was
madeline
hammond
nothing
had
ever
happened
to
her
and
here
playing
about
her
like
her
hair
played
about
stewart
face
was
adventure
perhaps
death
and
surely
life
she
could
not
believe
the
evidence
of
the
day
happenings
would
any
of
her
people
her
friends
ever
believe
it
could
she
tell
it
how
impossible
to
think
that
a
cunning
mexican
might
have
used
her
to
further
the
interests
of
a
forlorn
revolution
she
remembered
the
ghoulish
visages
of
those
starved
rebels
and
marveled
at
her
blessed
fortune
in
escaping
them
she
was
safe
and
now
had
some
meaning
for
her
stewart
arrival
in
the
glade
the
courage
with
which
he
had
faced
the
outlawed
men
grew
as
real
to
her
now
as
the
iron
arm
that
clasped
her
had
it
been
an
instinct
which
had
importuned
her
to
save
this
man
when
he
lay
ill
and
hopeless
in
the
shack
at
chiricahua
in
helping
him
had
she
hedged
round
her
forces
that
had
just
operated
to
save
her
life
or
if
not
that
more
than
life
was
to
her
she
believed
so
madeline
opened
her
eyes
after
a
while
and
found
that
night
had
fallen
the
sky
was
a
dark
velvety
blue
blazing
with
white
stars
the
cool
wind
tugged
at
her
hair
and
through
waving
strands
she
saw
profile
bold
and
sharp
against
the
sky
then
as
her
mind
succumbed
to
her
bodily
fatigue
again
her
situation
became
unreal
and
wild
a
heavy
languor
like
a
blanket
began
to
steal
upon
her
she
wavered
and
drifted
with
the
last
sense
of
a
muffled
throb
at
her
ear
a
something
intangibly
sweet
and
strange
like
a
distant
calling
bell
she
fell
asleep
with
her
head
on
stewart
breast
xii
friends
from
the
east
three
days
after
her
return
to
the
ranch
madeline
could
not
discover
any
physical
discomfort
as
a
reminder
of
her
adventurous
experiences
this
surprised
her
but
not
nearly
so
much
as
the
fact
that
after
a
few
weeks
she
found
she
scarcely
remembered
the
adventures
at
all
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
quiet
and
persistent
guardianship
of
her
cowboys
she
might
almost
have
forgotten
don
carlos
and
the
raiders
madeline
was
assured
of
the
splendid
physical
fitness
to
which
this
ranch
life
had
developed
her
and
that
she
was
assimilating
something
of
the
western
disregard
of
danger
a
hard
ride
an
accident
a
day
in
the
sun
and
dust
an
adventure
with
outlaws
these
might
once
have
been
matters
of
large
import
but
now
for
madeline
they
were
in
order
with
all
the
rest
of
her
changed
life
there
was
never
a
day
that
something
interesting
was
not
brought
to
her
notice
stillwell
who
had
ceaselessly
reproached
himself
for
riding
away
the
morning
madeline
was
captured
grew
more
like
an
anxious
parent
than
a
faithful
superintendent
he
was
never
at
ease
regarding
her
unless
he
was
near
the
ranch
or
had
left
stewart
there
or
else
nels
and
nick
steele
naturally
he
trusted
more
to
stewart
than
to
any
one
else
miss
majesty
it
sure
amazin
strange
about
gene
said
the
old
cattleman
as
he
tramped
into
madeline
office
what
the
matter
now
she
inquired
wal
gene
has
rustled
off
into
the
mountains
again
i
did
not
know
he
had
gone
i
gave
him
money
for
that
band
of
guerrillas
perhaps
he
went
to
take
it
to
no
he
took
that
a
day
or
so
after
he
fetched
you
back
home
then
in
about
a
week
he
went
a
second
time
an
he
packed
some
stuff
with
him
now
he
sneaked
off
an
nels
who
was
down
to
the
lower
trail
saw
him
meet
somebody
that
looked
like
padre
marcos
wal
i
went
down
to
the
church
and
sure
enough
padre
marcos
is
gone
what
do
you
think
of
that
miss
majesty
maybe
stewart
is
getting
religious
laughed
madeline
you
told
me
so
once
stillwell
puffed
and
wiped
his
red
face
if
you
heerd
him
cuss
monty
this
mawnin
you
never
guess
it
was
religion
monty
an
nels
hev
been
givin
gene
a
lot
of
trouble
lately
they
both
sore
an
in
fightin
mood
ever
since
don
carlos
hed
you
kidnapped
sure
they
goin
to
break
soon
an
then
we
hev
a
couple
of
wild
texas
steers
ridin
the
range
i
a
heap
to
worry
let
stewart
take
his
mysterious
trips
into
the
mountains
here
stillwell
i
have
news
for
you
that
may
give
you
reason
for
worry
i
have
letters
from
home
and
my
sister
with
a
party
of
friends
is
coming
out
to
visit
me
they
are
society
folk
and
one
of
them
is
an
english
wal
miss
majesty
i
reckon
we
all
be
glad
to
see
them
said
stillwell
onless
they
pack
you
off
back
that
is
likely
replied
madeline
thoughtfully
i
must
go
back
some
time
though
well
let
me
read
you
a
few
extracts
from
my
madeline
took
up
her
sister
letter
with
a
strange
sensation
of
how
easily
sight
of
a
crested
monogram
and
scent
of
delicately
perfumed
paper
could
recall
the
brilliant
life
she
had
given
up
she
scanned
the
pages
of
beautiful
handwriting
helen
letter
was
in
turn
gay
and
brilliant
and
lazy
just
as
she
was
herself
but
madeline
detected
more
of
curiosity
in
it
than
of
real
longing
to
see
the
sister
and
brother
in
the
far
west
much
of
what
helen
wrote
was
enthusiastic
anticipation
of
the
fun
she
expected
to
have
with
bashful
cowboys
helen
seldom
wrote
letters
and
she
never
read
anything
not
even
popular
novels
of
the
day
she
was
as
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
west
as
the
englishman
who
she
said
expected
to
hunt
buffalo
and
fight
indians
moreover
there
was
a
satiric
note
in
the
letter
that
madeline
did
not
like
and
which
roused
her
spirit
manifestly
helen
was
reveling
in
the
prospect
of
new
sensation
when
she
finished
reading
aloud
a
few
paragraphs
the
old
cattleman
snorted
and
his
face
grew
redder
did
your
sister
write
that
he
asked
wal
i
i
beg
pawdin
miss
majesty
but
it
does
seem
like
you
does
she
think
we
a
lot
of
wild
men
from
borneo
evidently
she
does
i
rather
think
she
is
in
for
a
surprise
now
stillwell
you
are
clever
and
you
can
see
the
situation
i
want
my
guests
to
enjoy
their
stay
here
but
i
do
not
want
that
to
be
at
the
expense
of
the
feelings
of
all
of
us
or
even
any
one
helen
will
bring
a
lively
crowd
they
crave
excitement
the
unusual
let
us
see
that
they
are
not
disappointed
you
take
the
boys
into
your
confidence
tell
them
what
to
expect
and
tell
them
how
to
meet
it
i
shall
help
you
in
that
i
want
the
boys
to
be
on
when
they
are
off
duty
i
want
them
to
be
on
their
most
elegant
behavior
i
do
not
care
what
they
do
what
measures
they
take
to
protect
themselves
what
tricks
they
contrive
so
long
as
they
do
not
overstep
the
limit
of
kindness
and
courtesy
i
want
them
to
play
their
parts
seriously
naturally
as
if
they
had
lived
no
other
way
my
guests
expect
to
have
fun
let
us
meet
them
with
fun
now
what
do
you
say
stillwell
rose
his
great
bulk
towering
his
huge
face
beaming
wal
i
say
it
the
most
amazin
fine
idee
i
ever
heerd
in
my
indeed
i
am
glad
you
like
it
went
on
madeline
come
to
me
again
stillwell
after
you
have
spoken
to
the
boys
but
now
that
i
have
suggested
it
i
am
a
little
afraid
you
know
what
cowboy
fun
is
perhaps
do
you
go
back
on
that
idee
interrupted
stillwell
he
was
assuring
and
bland
but
his
hurry
to
convince
madeline
betrayed
him
leave
the
boys
to
me
why
do
they
all
swear
by
you
same
as
the
mexicans
do
to
the
virgin
they
wo
disgrace
you
miss
majesty
they
be
simply
immense
it
beat
any
show
you
ever
i
believe
it
will
replied
madeline
she
was
still
doubtful
of
her
plan
but
the
enthusiasm
of
the
old
cattleman
was
infectious
and
irresistible
very
well
we
will
consider
it
settled
my
guests
will
arrive
on
may
ninth
meanwhile
let
us
get
her
majesty
rancho
in
shape
for
this
on
the
afternoon
of
the
ninth
of
may
perhaps
half
an
hour
after
madeline
had
received
a
telephone
message
from
link
stevens
announcing
the
arrival
of
her
guests
at
el
cajon
florence
called
her
out
upon
the
porch
stillwell
was
there
with
his
face
wrinkled
by
his
wonderful
smile
and
his
eagle
eyes
riveted
upon
the
distant
valley
far
away
perhaps
twenty
miles
a
thin
streak
of
white
dust
rose
from
the
valley
floor
and
slanted
skyward
look
said
florence
excitedly
what
is
that
asked
madeline
link
stevens
and
the
automobile
oh
no
why
it
only
a
few
minutes
since
he
telephoned
saying
the
party
had
just
take
a
look
with
the
glasses
said
florence
one
glance
through
the
powerful
binoculars
convinced
madeline
that
florence
was
right
and
another
glance
at
stillwell
told
her
that
he
was
speechless
with
delight
she
remembered
a
little
conversation
she
had
had
with
link
stevens
a
short
while
previous
stevens
i
hope
the
car
is
in
good
shape
she
had
said
now
miss
hammond
she
as
right
as
the
hoss
i
ever
rode
he
had
replied
the
valley
road
is
perfect
she
had
gone
on
musingly
i
never
saw
such
a
beautiful
road
even
in
france
no
fences
no
ditches
no
rocks
no
vehicles
just
a
lonely
road
on
the
shore
it
lonely
stevens
had
answered
with
slowly
brightening
eyes
an
safe
miss
my
sister
used
to
like
fast
riding
if
i
remember
correctly
all
of
my
guests
were
a
little
afflicted
with
the
speed
mania
it
is
a
common
disease
with
i
hope
stevens
that
you
will
not
give
them
reason
to
think
we
are
altogether
steeped
in
the
slow
dreamy
manana
languor
of
the
link
doubtfully
eyed
her
and
then
his
bronze
face
changed
its
dark
aspect
and
seemed
to
shine
beggin
your
pardon
miss
hammond
thet
shore
tall
talk
fer
link
stevens
to
savvy
you
mean
as
long
as
i
drive
careful
an
safe
i
can
run
away
from
my
dust
so
to
say
an
get
here
in
somethin
less
than
the
greaser
madeline
had
laughed
her
assent
and
now
as
she
watched
the
thin
streak
of
dust
at
that
distance
moving
with
snail
pace
she
reproached
herself
she
trusted
stevens
she
had
never
known
so
skilful
daring
and
a
driver
as
he
was
if
she
had
been
in
the
car
herself
she
would
have
had
no
anxiety
but
imagining
what
stevens
would
do
on
forty
miles
and
more
of
that
desert
road
madeline
suffered
a
prick
of
conscience
oh
stillwell
she
exclaimed
i
am
afraid
i
will
go
back
on
my
wonderful
idea
what
made
me
do
it
your
sister
wanted
the
real
thing
did
she
said
they
all
wanted
it
wal
i
reckon
they
begun
gettin
it
replied
stillwell
that
statement
from
the
cattleman
allayed
madeline
pangs
of
conscience
she
understood
just
what
she
felt
though
she
could
not
have
put
it
in
words
she
was
hungry
for
a
sight
of
faces
she
longed
to
hear
the
soft
laughter
and
gay
repartee
of
old
friends
she
was
eager
for
gossipy
news
of
her
old
world
nevertheless
something
in
her
sister
letter
in
messages
from
the
others
who
were
coming
had
touched
madeline
pride
in
one
sense
the
expected
guests
were
hostile
inasmuch
as
they
were
scornful
and
curious
about
the
west
that
had
claimed
her
she
imagined
what
they
would
expect
in
a
western
ranch
they
would
surely
get
the
real
thing
too
as
stillwell
said
and
in
that
certainty
was
satisfaction
for
a
small
grain
of
something
within
madeline
which
approached
resentment
she
wistfully
wondered
however
if
her
sister
or
friends
would
come
to
see
the
west
even
a
little
as
she
saw
it
that
perhaps
would
he
hoping
too
much
she
resolved
once
for
all
to
do
her
best
to
give
them
the
sensation
their
senses
craved
and
equally
to
show
them
the
sweetness
and
beauty
and
wholesomeness
and
strength
of
life
in
the
southwest
wal
as
nels
says
i
would
be
in
that
there
ottomobile
right
now
for
a
million
pesos
remarked
stillwell
why
is
stevens
driving
fast
good
lord
fast
miss
majesty
there
hai
ever
been
anythin
except
a
streak
of
lightnin
run
so
fast
in
this
country
i
bet
link
for
once
is
in
heaven
i
can
jest
see
him
now
the
grim
little
devil
hunchin
down
over
that
wheel
as
if
it
was
a
hoss
i
told
him
not
to
let
the
ride
be
hot
or
dusty
remarked
madeline
haw
haw
roared
stillwell
wal
i
be
goin
i
reckon
i
like
to
be
hyar
when
link
drives
up
but
i
want
to
be
with
the
boys
down
by
the
bunks
it
be
some
fun
to
see
nels
an
monty
when
link
comes
i
wish
al
had
stayed
to
meet
them
said
madeline
her
brother
had
rather
hurried
a
shipment
of
cattle
to
california
and
it
was
madeline
supposition
that
he
had
welcomed
the
opportunity
to
absent
himself
from
the
ranch
i
am
sorry
he
would
stay
replied
florence
but
al
all
business
now
and
he
doing
finely
it
just
as
well
surely
that
was
my
pride
speaking
i
would
like
to
have
all
my
family
and
all
my
old
friends
see
what
a
man
al
has
become
well
link
stevens
is
running
like
the
wind
the
car
will
be
here
before
we
know
it
florence
we
only
a
few
moments
to
dress
but
first
i
want
to
order
many
and
various
and
exceedingly
cold
refreshments
for
that
approaching
less
than
a
later
madeline
went
again
to
the
porch
and
found
florence
there
oh
you
look
just
lovely
exclaimed
florence
impulsively
as
she
gazed
up
at
madeline
and
somehow
so
different
madeline
smiled
a
little
sadly
perhaps
when
she
had
put
on
that
exquisite
white
gown
something
had
come
to
her
of
the
manner
which
befitted
the
wearing
of
it
she
could
not
resist
the
desire
to
look
fair
once
more
in
the
eyes
of
these
hypercritical
friends
the
sad
smile
had
been
for
the
days
that
were
gone
for
she
knew
that
what
society
had
once
been
pleased
to
call
her
beauty
had
trebled
since
it
had
last
been
seen
in
a
madeline
wore
no
jewels
but
at
her
waist
she
had
pinned
two
great
crimson
roses
against
the
dead
white
they
had
the
life
and
fire
and
redness
of
the
desert
link
hit
the
old
trail
said
florence
and
oh
is
he
riding
that
car
with
florence
as
with
most
of
the
cowboys
the
car
was
never
driven
but
ridden
a
white
spot
with
a
long
trail
of
dust
showed
low
down
in
the
valley
it
was
now
headed
almost
straight
for
the
ranch
madeline
watched
it
growing
larger
moment
by
moment
and
her
pleasurable
emotion
grew
accordingly
then
the
rapid
beat
of
a
horse
hoofs
caused
her
to
turn
stewart
was
riding
in
on
his
black
horse
he
had
been
absent
on
an
important
mission
and
his
duty
had
taken
him
to
the
international
his
presence
home
long
before
he
was
expected
was
particularly
gratifying
to
madeline
for
it
meant
that
his
mission
had
been
brought
to
a
successful
issue
once
more
for
the
hundredth
time
the
man
reliability
struck
madeline
he
was
a
doer
of
things
the
black
horse
halted
wearily
without
the
usual
pound
of
hoofs
on
the
gravel
and
the
dusty
rider
dismounted
wearily
both
horse
and
rider
showed
the
heat
and
dust
and
wind
of
many
miles
madeline
advanced
to
the
porch
steps
and
stewart
after
taking
a
parcel
of
papers
from
a
turned
toward
her
stewart
you
are
the
best
of
couriers
she
said
i
am
dust
streamed
from
his
sombrero
as
he
doffed
it
his
dark
face
seemed
to
rise
as
he
straightened
weary
shoulders
here
are
the
reports
miss
hammond
he
replied
as
he
looked
up
to
see
her
standing
there
dressed
to
receive
her
eastern
guests
he
checked
his
advance
with
a
violent
action
which
recalled
to
madeline
the
one
he
had
made
on
the
night
she
had
met
him
when
she
disclosed
her
identity
it
was
not
fear
nor
embarrassment
nor
awkwardness
and
it
was
only
momentary
yet
slight
as
had
been
his
pause
madeline
received
from
it
an
impression
of
some
strong
halting
force
a
man
struck
by
a
bullet
might
have
had
an
instant
jerk
of
muscular
control
such
as
convulsed
stewart
in
that
instant
as
her
keen
gaze
searched
his
face
she
met
the
full
free
look
of
his
eyes
her
own
did
not
fall
though
she
felt
a
warmth
steal
to
her
cheeks
madeline
very
seldom
blushed
and
now
conscious
of
her
sudden
color
a
genuine
blush
flamed
on
her
face
it
was
irritating
because
it
was
incomprehensible
she
received
the
papers
from
stewart
and
thanked
him
he
bowed
then
led
the
black
down
the
path
toward
the
corrals
when
stewart
looks
like
that
he
been
riding
said
florence
but
when
his
horse
looks
like
that
he
sure
been
burning
the
madeline
watched
the
weary
horse
and
rider
limp
down
the
path
what
had
made
her
thoughtful
mostly
it
was
something
new
or
sudden
or
inexplicable
that
stirred
her
mind
to
quick
analysis
in
this
instance
the
thing
that
had
struck
madeline
was
stewart
glance
he
had
looked
at
her
and
the
old
burning
inscrutable
fire
the
darkness
had
left
his
eyes
suddenly
they
had
been
beautiful
the
look
had
not
been
one
of
surprise
or
admiration
nor
had
it
been
one
of
love
she
was
familiar
too
familiar
with
all
three
it
had
not
been
a
gaze
of
passion
for
there
was
nothing
beautiful
in
that
madeline
pondered
and
presently
she
realized
that
stewart
eyes
had
expressed
a
strange
joy
of
pride
that
expression
madeline
had
never
before
encountered
in
the
look
of
any
man
probably
its
strangeness
had
made
her
notice
it
and
accounted
for
her
blushing
the
longer
she
lived
among
these
outdoor
men
the
more
they
surprised
her
particularly
how
incomprehensible
was
this
cowboy
stewart
why
should
he
have
pride
or
joy
at
sight
of
her
florence
exclamation
made
madeline
once
more
attend
to
the
approaching
automobile
it
was
on
the
slope
now
some
miles
down
the
long
gradual
slant
two
yellow
clouds
of
dust
seemed
to
shoot
out
from
behind
the
car
and
roll
aloft
to
join
the
column
that
stretched
down
the
valley
i
wonder
what
riding
a
mile
a
minute
would
be
like
said
florence
i
sure
make
link
take
me
oh
but
look
at
him
come
the
giant
car
resembled
a
white
demon
and
but
for
the
dust
would
have
appeared
to
be
sailing
in
the
air
its
motion
was
steadily
forward
holding
to
the
road
as
if
on
rails
and
its
velocity
was
astounding
long
gray
veils
like
pennants
streamed
in
the
wind
a
low
rushing
sound
became
perceptible
and
it
grew
louder
became
a
roar
the
car
shot
like
an
arrow
past
the
by
the
where
the
cowboys
waved
and
cheered
the
horses
and
burros
in
the
corrals
began
to
snort
and
tramp
and
race
in
fright
at
the
base
of
the
long
slope
of
the
foothill
link
cut
the
speed
more
than
half
yet
the
car
roared
up
rolling
the
dust
flying
capes
and
veils
and
ulsters
and
crashed
and
cracked
to
a
halt
in
the
yard
before
the
porch
madeline
descried
a
gray
disheveled
mass
of
humanity
packed
inside
the
car
besides
the
driver
there
were
seven
occupants
and
for
a
moment
they
appeared
to
be
coming
to
life
moving
and
exclaiming
under
the
veils
and
wraps
and
link
stevens
stepped
out
and
removing
helmet
and
goggles
coolly
looked
at
his
watch
an
hour
an
a
quarter
miss
hammond
he
said
it
miles
by
the
valley
road
an
you
know
there
a
couple
of
bad
hills
i
reckon
we
made
fair
time
considerin
you
wanted
me
to
drive
slow
an
from
the
mass
of
humanity
in
the
car
came
low
exclamations
and
plaintive
feminine
wails
madeline
stepped
to
the
front
of
the
porch
then
the
deep
voices
of
men
and
softer
voices
of
women
united
in
one
glad
outburst
as
much
a
thanksgiving
as
a
greeting
majesty
helen
hammond
was
three
years
younger
than
madeline
and
a
slender
pretty
girl
she
did
not
resemble
her
sister
except
in
whiteness
and
fineness
of
skin
being
more
of
a
type
having
recovered
her
breath
soon
after
madeline
took
her
to
her
room
she
began
to
talk
majesty
old
girl
i
here
but
you
can
bet
i
would
never
have
gotten
here
if
i
had
known
about
that
ride
from
the
railroad
you
never
wrote
that
you
had
a
car
i
thought
this
was
out
west
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
such
a
tremendous
car
and
the
road
and
that
terrible
little
man
with
the
leather
trousers
what
kind
of
a
chauffeur
is
he
he
a
cowboy
he
was
crippled
by
falling
under
his
horse
so
i
had
him
instructed
to
run
the
car
he
can
drive
do
you
think
drive
good
gracious
he
scared
us
to
death
except
castleton
nothing
could
scare
that
little
englishman
i
am
dizzy
yet
do
you
know
majesty
i
was
delighted
when
i
saw
the
car
then
your
cowboy
driver
met
us
at
the
platform
what
a
individual
he
had
a
big
pistol
strapped
to
those
leather
trousers
that
made
me
nervous
when
he
piled
us
all
in
with
our
grips
he
put
me
in
the
seat
beside
him
whether
i
liked
it
or
not
i
was
fool
enough
to
tell
him
i
loved
to
travel
fast
what
do
you
think
he
said
well
he
eyed
me
in
a
rather
cool
and
speculative
way
and
said
with
a
smile
i
reckon
anything
you
love
an
want
bad
will
be
coming
to
you
out
here
i
know
whether
it
was
delightful
candor
or
impudence
then
he
said
to
all
of
us
you
had
better
wrap
up
in
the
veils
an
dusters
it
a
long
slow
hot
dusty
ride
to
the
ranch
an
miss
hammond
order
was
to
drive
safe
he
got
our
baggage
checks
and
gave
them
to
a
man
with
a
huge
wagon
and
a
team
then
he
cranked
the
car
jumped
in
wrapped
his
arms
round
the
wheel
and
sank
down
low
in
his
seat
there
was
a
crack
a
jerk
a
kind
of
flash
around
us
and
that
dirty
little
town
was
somewhere
on
the
map
behind
for
about
five
minutes
i
had
a
lovely
time
then
the
wind
began
to
tear
me
to
pieces
i
could
hear
anything
but
the
rush
of
wind
and
roar
of
the
car
i
could
see
only
straight
ahead
what
a
road
i
never
saw
a
road
in
my
life
till
miles
and
miles
and
miles
ahead
with
not
even
a
post
or
tree
that
big
car
seemed
to
leap
at
the
miles
it
hummed
and
sang
i
was
fascinated
then
terrified
we
went
so
fast
i
could
catch
my
breath
the
wind
went
through
me
and
i
expected
to
be
disrobed
by
it
any
minute
i
was
afraid
i
could
hold
any
clothes
on
presently
all
i
could
see
was
a
flashing
gray
wall
with
a
white
line
in
the
middle
then
my
eyes
blurred
my
face
burned
my
ears
grew
full
of
a
hundred
thousand
howling
devils
i
was
about
ready
to
die
when
the
car
stopped
i
looked
and
looked
and
when
i
could
see
there
you
stood
helen
i
thought
you
were
fond
of
speeding
said
madeline
with
a
laugh
i
was
but
i
assure
you
i
never
before
was
in
a
fast
car
i
never
saw
a
road
i
never
met
a
perhaps
i
may
have
a
few
surprises
for
you
out
here
in
the
wild
and
woolly
helen
dark
eyes
showed
a
sister
memory
of
possibilities
you
started
well
she
said
i
am
simply
stunned
i
expected
to
find
you
old
and
dowdy
majesty
you
the
handsomest
thing
i
ever
laid
eyes
on
you
so
splendid
and
strong
and
your
skin
is
like
white
gold
what
happened
to
you
what
changed
you
this
beautiful
room
those
glorious
roses
out
there
the
cool
dark
sweetness
of
this
wonderful
house
i
know
you
majesty
and
though
you
never
wrote
it
i
believe
you
have
made
a
home
out
here
that
the
most
stunning
surprise
of
all
come
confess
i
know
i
always
been
selfish
and
not
much
of
a
sister
but
if
you
are
happy
out
here
i
am
glad
you
were
not
happy
at
home
tell
me
about
yourself
and
about
alfred
then
i
shall
give
you
all
the
messages
and
news
from
the
it
afforded
madeline
exceeding
pleasure
to
have
from
one
and
all
of
her
guests
varied
encomiums
of
her
beautiful
home
and
a
real
and
warm
interest
in
what
promised
to
be
a
delightful
and
memorable
visit
of
them
all
castleton
was
the
only
one
who
failed
to
show
surprise
he
greeted
her
precisely
as
he
had
when
he
had
last
seen
her
in
london
madeline
rather
to
her
astonishment
found
meeting
him
again
pleasurable
she
discovered
she
liked
this
imperturbable
englishman
manifestly
her
capacity
for
liking
any
one
had
immeasurably
enlarged
quite
unexpectedly
her
old
girlish
love
for
her
younger
sister
sprang
into
life
and
with
it
interest
in
these
friends
and
a
warm
regard
for
edith
wayne
a
chum
of
college
days
helen
party
was
smaller
than
madeline
had
expected
it
to
be
helen
had
been
careful
to
select
a
company
of
good
friends
all
of
whom
were
well
known
to
madeline
edith
wayne
was
a
patrician
brunette
a
serious
woman
sweet
and
kindly
despite
a
rather
bitter
experience
that
had
left
her
worldly
wise
carrollton
beck
a
plain
lively
person
had
chaperoned
the
party
the
fourth
and
last
of
the
feminine
contingent
was
miss
dorothy
coombs
dot
as
they
called
her
a
young
woman
of
attractive
blond
prettiness
for
a
man
castleton
was
of
very
small
stature
he
had
a
complexion
a
small
golden
mustache
and
his
heavy
eyelids
always
drooping
made
him
look
dull
his
attire
cut
to
what
appeared
to
be
an
exaggerated
english
style
attracted
attention
to
his
diminutive
size
he
was
immaculate
and
fastidious
robert
weede
was
a
rather
large
florid
young
man
remarkable
only
for
his
good
nature
counting
boyd
harvey
a
handsome
fellow
with
the
careless
smile
of
the
man
for
whom
life
had
been
easy
and
pleasant
the
party
was
complete
dinner
was
a
happy
hour
especially
for
the
mexican
women
who
served
it
and
who
could
not
fail
to
note
its
success
the
mingling
of
low
voices
and
laughter
the
old
gay
superficial
talk
the
graciousness
of
a
class
which
lived
for
the
pleasure
of
things
and
to
make
time
pass
pleasurably
for
others
all
took
madeline
far
back
into
the
past
she
did
not
care
to
return
to
it
but
she
saw
that
it
was
well
she
had
not
wholly
cut
herself
off
from
her
people
and
friends
when
the
party
adjourned
to
the
porch
the
heat
had
markedly
decreased
and
the
red
sun
was
sinking
over
the
red
desert
an
absence
of
spoken
praise
a
gradually
deepening
silence
attested
to
the
impression
on
the
visitors
of
that
noble
sunset
just
as
the
last
curve
of
red
rim
vanished
beyond
the
dim
sierra
madres
and
the
golden
lightning
began
to
flare
brighter
helen
broke
the
silence
with
an
exclamation
it
wants
only
life
ah
there
a
horse
climbing
the
hill
see
up
he
has
a
rider
madeline
knew
before
she
looked
the
identity
of
the
man
riding
up
the
mesa
but
she
did
not
know
until
that
moment
how
the
habit
of
watching
for
him
at
this
hour
had
grown
upon
her
he
rode
along
the
rim
of
the
mesa
and
out
to
the
point
where
against
the
golden
background
horse
and
rider
stood
silhouetted
in
bold
relief
what
he
doing
there
who
is
he
inquired
the
curious
helen
that
is
stewart
my
man
replied
madeline
every
day
when
he
is
at
the
ranch
he
rides
up
there
at
sunset
i
think
he
likes
the
ride
and
the
scene
but
he
goes
to
take
a
look
at
the
cattle
in
the
is
he
a
cowboy
asked
helen
indeed
yes
replied
madeline
with
a
little
laugh
you
will
think
so
when
stillwell
gets
hold
of
you
and
begins
to
madeline
found
it
necessary
to
explain
who
stillwell
was
and
what
he
thought
of
stewart
and
while
she
was
about
it
of
her
own
accord
she
added
a
few
details
of
stewart
fame
el
capitan
how
interesting
mused
helen
what
does
he
look
like
he
is
florence
handed
the
to
helen
and
bade
her
look
oh
thank
you
said
helen
as
she
complied
there
i
see
him
indeed
he
is
superb
what
a
magnificent
horse
how
still
he
stands
why
he
seems
carved
in
let
me
look
said
dorothy
coombs
eagerly
helen
gave
her
the
glass
you
can
look
dot
but
that
all
he
mine
i
saw
him
whereupon
madeline
feminine
guests
held
a
spirited
contest
over
the
and
three
of
them
made
gay
bantering
boasts
not
to
consider
helen
rights
madeline
laughed
with
the
others
while
she
watched
the
dark
figure
of
stewart
and
his
black
outline
against
the
sky
there
came
over
her
a
thought
not
by
any
means
new
or
strange
she
wondered
what
was
in
stewart
mind
as
he
stood
there
in
the
solitude
and
faced
the
desert
and
the
darkening
west
some
day
she
meant
to
ask
him
presently
he
turned
the
horse
and
rode
down
into
the
shadow
creeping
up
the
mesa
majesty
have
you
planned
any
fun
any
excitement
for
us
asked
helen
she
was
restless
nervous
and
did
not
seem
to
be
able
to
sit
still
a
moment
you
will
think
so
when
i
get
through
with
you
replied
madeline
what
for
instance
inquired
helen
and
dot
and
beck
in
unison
edith
wayne
smiled
her
interest
well
i
am
not
counting
rides
and
climbs
and
golf
but
these
are
necessary
to
train
you
for
trips
over
into
arizona
i
want
to
show
you
the
desert
and
the
aravaipa
canyon
we
have
to
go
on
horseback
and
pack
our
outfit
if
any
of
you
are
alive
after
those
trips
and
want
more
we
shall
go
up
into
the
mountains
i
should
like
very
much
to
know
what
you
each
want
i
tell
you
replied
helen
promptly
dot
will
be
the
same
out
here
as
she
was
in
the
east
she
wants
to
look
bashfully
down
at
her
hand
a
hand
imprisoned
in
another
by
the
way
and
listen
to
a
man
talk
poetry
about
her
eyes
if
cowboys
do
make
love
that
way
dot
visit
will
be
a
failure
now
elsie
beck
wants
solely
to
be
revenged
upon
us
for
dragging
her
out
here
she
wants
some
dreadful
thing
to
happen
to
us
i
do
know
what
in
edith
head
but
it
is
fun
bobby
wants
to
be
near
elsie
and
no
more
boyd
wants
what
he
has
always
wanted
the
only
thing
he
ever
wanted
that
he
did
get
castleton
has
a
horrible
bloodthirsty
desire
to
kill
i
declare
now
i
want
to
ride
and
camp
out
also
protested
castleton
as
for
myself
went
on
helen
i
want
oh
if
i
only
knew
what
it
is
that
i
want
well
i
know
i
want
to
be
outdoors
to
get
into
the
open
to
feel
sun
and
wind
to
burn
some
color
into
my
white
face
i
want
some
flesh
and
blood
and
life
i
am
tired
out
beyond
all
that
i
do
know
very
well
i
try
to
keep
dot
from
attaching
all
the
cowboys
to
her
what
a
diversity
of
wants
said
madeline
above
all
majesty
we
want
something
to
happen
concluded
helen
with
passionate
finality
my
dear
sister
maybe
you
will
have
your
wish
fulfilled
replied
madeline
soberly
edith
helen
has
made
me
curious
about
your
especial
majesty
it
is
only
that
i
wanted
to
be
with
you
for
a
while
replied
this
old
friend
there
was
in
the
wistful
reply
accompanied
by
a
dark
and
eloquent
glance
of
eyes
what
told
madeline
of
edith
understanding
of
her
sympathy
and
perhaps
a
betrayal
of
her
own
unquiet
soul
it
saddened
madeline
how
many
women
might
there
not
be
who
had
the
longing
to
break
down
the
bars
of
their
cage
but
had
not
the
spirit
xiii
cowboy
golf
in
the
whirl
of
the
succeeding
days
it
was
a
mooted
question
whether
madeline
guests
or
her
cowboys
or
herself
got
the
keenest
enjoyment
out
of
the
flying
time
considering
the
sameness
of
the
ordinary
life
she
was
inclined
to
think
they
made
the
most
of
the
present
stillwell
and
stewart
however
had
found
the
situation
trying
the
work
of
the
ranch
had
to
go
on
and
some
of
it
got
sadly
neglected
stillwell
could
not
resist
the
ladies
any
more
than
he
could
resist
the
fun
in
the
extraordinary
of
the
cowboys
stewart
alone
kept
the
business
of
from
a
serious
setback
early
and
late
he
was
in
the
saddle
driving
the
lazy
mexicans
whom
he
had
hired
to
relieve
the
cowboys
one
morning
in
june
madeline
was
sitting
on
the
porch
with
her
merry
friends
when
stillwell
appeared
on
the
corral
path
he
had
not
come
to
consult
madeline
for
several
days
an
omission
so
unusual
as
to
be
remarked
here
comes
bill
in
trouble
laughed
florence
indeed
he
bore
some
faint
resemblance
to
a
thundercloud
as
he
approached
the
porch
but
the
greetings
he
got
from
madeline
party
especially
from
helen
and
dorothy
chased
away
the
blackness
from
his
face
and
brought
the
wonderful
wrinkling
smile
miss
majesty
sure
i
a
sad
demoralized
old
cattleman
he
said
presently
an
i
in
need
of
a
heap
of
what
wrong
now
asked
madeline
with
her
encouraging
smile
wal
it
so
amazin
strange
what
cowboys
will
do
i
jest
am
about
to
give
up
why
you
might
say
my
cowboys
were
all
on
strike
for
vacations
what
do
you
think
of
that
we
changed
the
shifts
shortened
hours
let
one
an
another
off
duty
hired
greasers
an
in
fact
done
everythin
that
could
be
thought
of
but
this
vacation
idee
growed
worse
when
stewart
set
his
foot
down
then
the
boys
begin
to
get
sick
never
in
my
born
days
as
a
cattleman
have
i
heerd
of
so
many
diseases
an
you
ought
to
see
how
lame
an
crippled
an
weak
many
of
the
boys
have
got
all
of
a
sudden
the
idee
of
a
cowboy
comin
to
me
with
a
sore
finger
an
askin
to
be
let
off
for
a
day
there
booly
now
knowed
a
hoss
to
fall
all
over
him
an
onct
he
rolled
down
a
canyon
never
bothered
him
at
all
he
got
a
blister
on
his
heel
a
blister
an
he
says
it
goin
to
if
he
does
rest
there
jim
bell
he
developed
what
he
says
is
spinal
mengalootis
or
some
such
like
there
frankie
slade
he
swore
he
had
scarlet
fever
because
his
face
burnt
so
red
i
guess
an
when
i
hollered
that
scarlet
fever
was
contagious
an
he
must
be
put
away
somewhere
he
up
an
says
he
guessed
it
was
that
but
he
was
sure
awful
sick
an
needed
to
loaf
around
an
be
amused
why
even
nels
does
want
to
work
these
days
if
it
was
for
stewart
who
had
greasers
with
the
cattle
i
do
know
what
i
why
all
this
sudden
illness
and
idleness
asked
madeline
wal
you
see
the
truth
is
every
blamed
cowboy
on
the
range
except
stewart
thinks
it
his
bounden
duty
to
entertain
the
i
think
that
is
just
fine
exclaimed
dorothy
coombs
and
she
joined
in
the
general
laugh
stewart
then
does
care
to
help
entertain
us
inquired
helen
in
curious
interest
wal
miss
helen
stewart
is
sure
different
from
the
other
cowboys
replied
stillwell
yet
he
used
to
be
like
them
there
never
was
a
cowboy
fuller
of
the
devil
than
gene
but
he
changed
foreman
here
an
that
must
be
it
all
the
responsibility
rests
on
him
he
sure
has
no
time
for
amusin
the
i
imagine
that
is
our
loss
said
edith
wayne
in
her
earnest
way
i
admire
stillwell
you
need
not
be
so
distressed
with
what
is
only
gallantry
in
the
boys
even
if
it
does
make
a
temporary
confusion
in
the
work
said
madeline
miss
majesty
all
i
said
is
not
the
half
nor
the
quarter
nor
of
what
troublin
me
answered
he
sadly
very
well
unburden
wal
the
cowboys
exceptin
gene
have
gone
plumb
batty
jest
plain
crazy
over
this
heah
game
of
a
merry
peal
of
mirth
greeted
stillwell
solemn
assertion
oh
stillwell
you
are
in
fun
replied
madeline
i
hope
to
die
if
i
not
in
daid
earnest
declared
the
cattleman
it
an
amazin
strange
fact
ask
flo
she
tell
you
she
knows
cowboys
an
how
if
they
ever
start
on
somethin
they
ride
it
as
they
ride
a
florence
being
appealed
to
and
evidently
feeling
all
eyes
upon
her
modestly
replied
that
stillwell
had
scarcely
misstated
the
situation
cowboys
play
like
they
work
or
fight
she
added
they
give
their
whole
souls
to
it
they
are
great
big
simple
indeed
they
are
said
madeline
oh
i
glad
if
they
like
the
game
of
golf
they
have
so
little
wal
somethin
got
to
be
did
if
we
to
go
on
raisin
cattle
at
her
majesty
rancho
replied
stillwell
he
appeared
both
deliberate
and
resigned
madeline
remembered
that
despite
stillwell
simplicity
he
was
as
deep
as
any
of
his
cowboys
and
there
was
absolutely
no
gaging
him
where
possibilities
of
fun
were
concerned
madeline
fancied
that
his
exaggerated
talk
about
the
cowboys
sudden
craze
for
golf
was
in
line
with
certain
other
remarkable
tales
that
had
lately
emanated
from
him
some
very
strange
things
had
occurred
of
late
and
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
or
not
they
were
accidents
mere
coincidents
or
skilfully
designs
of
the
cowboys
certainly
there
had
been
great
fun
and
at
the
expense
of
her
guests
particularly
castleton
so
madeline
was
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
think
about
stillwell
latest
elaboration
from
mere
force
of
habit
she
sympathized
with
him
and
found
difficulty
in
doubting
his
apparent
sincerity
to
go
back
a
ways
went
on
stillwell
as
madeline
looked
up
expectantly
you
recollect
what
pride
the
boys
took
in
fixin
up
that
course
out
on
the
mesa
wal
they
worked
on
that
job
an
though
i
never
seen
any
other
course
i
gamble
yours
ca
be
beat
the
boys
was
sure
curious
about
that
game
you
recollect
also
how
they
all
wanted
to
see
you
an
your
brother
play
an
be
caddies
for
you
wal
whenever
you
quit
they
go
to
work
tryin
to
play
the
game
monty
price
he
was
the
leadin
spirit
old
as
i
am
miss
majesty
an
used
as
i
am
to
cowboy
excentrikities
i
nearly
dropped
daid
when
i
heered
that
little
montana
say
there
was
any
game
too
swell
for
him
an
was
just
his
speed
serious
as
a
preacher
mind
you
he
was
an
he
was
always
practisin
when
stewart
gave
him
charge
of
the
course
an
the
an
all
them
funny
sticks
why
monty
was
tickled
to
death
you
see
monty
is
sensitive
that
he
ai
much
good
any
more
for
cowboy
work
he
was
glad
to
have
a
job
that
he
did
feel
he
was
hangin
to
by
kindness
wal
he
practised
the
game
an
he
read
the
books
in
the
an
he
got
the
boys
to
doin
the
same
that
was
very
hard
i
reckon
they
played
early
an
late
an
in
the
moonlight
for
a
while
monty
was
coach
an
the
boys
stood
it
but
pretty
soon
frankie
slade
got
puffed
on
his
game
an
he
had
to
have
it
out
with
monty
wal
monty
beat
him
bad
then
one
after
another
the
other
boys
tackled
monty
he
beat
them
all
after
that
they
split
up
an
begin
to
play
matches
two
on
a
side
for
a
spell
this
worked
fine
but
cowboys
ca
never
be
satisfied
long
onless
they
win
all
the
time
monty
an
link
stevens
both
cripples
you
might
say
joined
forces
an
elected
to
beat
all
comers
wal
they
did
an
the
trouble
long
an
patient
the
other
cowboys
tried
to
beat
them
two
game
legs
an
hev
done
it
mebbe
if
monty
an
link
was
perfectly
sound
in
their
legs
like
the
other
cowboys
there
would
hev
been
such
a
holler
but
no
sound
cowboys
ever
stand
for
a
disgrace
like
that
why
down
at
the
bunks
in
the
evenin
it
some
mortifyin
the
way
monty
an
link
crow
over
the
rest
of
the
outfit
they
taken
on
superior
airs
you
could
reach
up
to
monty
with
a
trimmed
spruce
pole
an
link
wal
he
just
amazin
scornful
a
swell
game
ai
it
says
link
powerful
sarcastic
what
hurtin
you
common
cowmen
you
keep
harpin
on
game
leg
an
on
my
game
leg
if
we
hed
good
legs
we
beat
you
all
the
wuss
it
brains
that
wins
in
brains
an
airstoocratik
blood
which
of
the
same
you
fellers
sure
hev
little
an
then
monty
he
blows
smoke
powerful
careless
an
superior
an
he
says
it
a
swell
game
you
gents
think
beef
an
brawn
ought
to
hev
the
call
over
skill
an
gray
matter
you
all
hev
to
back
up
an
get
down
go
out
an
learn
the
game
you
do
know
a
baffy
from
a
chinee
sandwich
all
you
can
do
is
waggle
with
a
club
an
fozzle
the
ball
whenever
monty
gets
to
usin
them
queer
names
the
boys
go
round
kind
of
dotty
monty
an
link
hev
got
the
books
an
directions
of
the
game
they
wo
let
the
other
boys
see
them
they
show
the
rules
but
that
all
an
of
course
every
game
ends
in
a
row
almost
before
started
the
boys
are
all
turrible
in
earnest
about
this
an
i
want
to
say
for
the
good
of
ranchin
not
to
mention
a
possible
fight
that
monty
an
link
hev
got
to
be
beat
there
be
no
peace
round
this
ranch
till
that
madeline
guests
were
much
amused
as
for
herself
in
spite
of
her
scarcely
considered
doubt
stillwell
tale
of
woe
occasioned
her
anxiety
however
she
could
hardly
control
her
mirth
what
in
the
world
can
i
do
wal
i
reckon
i
could
say
i
only
come
to
you
for
advice
it
seems
that
a
queer
kind
of
game
has
locoed
my
cowboys
an
for
the
time
ranchin
is
at
a
standstill
sounds
ridiculous
i
know
but
cowboys
are
as
strange
as
wild
cattle
all
i
sure
of
is
that
the
conceit
has
got
to
be
taken
out
of
monty
an
link
onct
just
onct
will
square
it
then
we
can
resoome
our
stillwell
listen
said
madeline
brightly
we
arrange
a
match
game
a
foursome
between
monty
and
link
and
your
best
picked
team
castleton
who
is
an
expert
golfer
will
umpire
my
sister
and
friends
and
i
will
take
turns
as
caddies
for
your
team
that
will
be
fair
considering
yours
is
the
weaker
caddies
may
coach
and
perhaps
expert
advice
is
all
that
is
necessary
for
your
team
to
defeat
a
grand
idee
declared
stillwell
with
instant
decision
when
can
we
have
this
match
game
why
this
afternoon
we
all
ride
out
to
the
wal
i
reckon
i
be
some
indebted
to
you
miss
majesty
an
all
your
guests
replied
stillwell
warmly
he
rose
with
sombrero
in
hand
and
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
that
again
prompted
madeline
to
wonder
an
now
be
goin
to
fix
up
for
the
game
of
cowboy
the
idea
was
as
enthusiastically
received
by
madeline
guests
as
it
had
been
by
stillwell
they
were
highly
amused
and
speculative
to
the
point
of
taking
sides
and
making
wagers
on
their
choice
moreover
this
situation
so
frankly
revealed
by
stillwell
had
completed
their
deep
mystification
they
were
now
absolutely
nonplussed
by
the
singular
character
of
american
cowboys
madeline
was
pleased
to
note
how
seriously
they
had
taken
the
old
cattleman
story
she
had
a
little
throb
of
wild
expectancy
that
made
her
both
fear
and
delight
in
the
afternoon
prospect
the
june
days
had
set
in
warm
in
fact
hot
during
the
noon
hours
and
this
had
inculcated
in
her
insatiable
visitors
a
tendency
to
profit
by
the
experience
of
those
used
to
the
southwest
they
indulged
in
the
restful
siesta
during
the
heated
term
of
the
day
madeline
was
awakened
by
majesty
whistle
and
pounding
on
the
gravel
then
she
heard
the
other
horses
when
she
went
out
she
found
her
party
assembled
in
gala
golf
attire
and
with
spirits
to
match
their
costumes
castleton
especially
appeared
resplendent
in
a
golf
coat
that
beggared
description
madeline
had
faint
misgivings
when
she
reflected
on
what
monty
and
nels
and
nick
might
do
under
the
influence
of
that
blazing
garment
oh
majesty
cried
helen
as
madeline
went
up
to
her
horse
make
him
kneel
try
that
flying
mount
we
all
want
to
see
it
it
so
but
that
way
too
i
must
have
him
kneel
said
madeline
or
i
reach
the
stirrup
he
so
tremendously
madeline
had
to
yield
to
the
laughing
insistence
of
her
friends
and
after
all
of
them
except
florence
were
up
she
made
majesty
go
down
on
one
knee
then
she
stood
on
his
left
side
facing
back
and
took
a
good
firm
grip
on
the
bridle
and
pommel
and
his
mane
after
she
had
slipped
the
toe
of
her
boot
firmly
into
the
stirrup
she
called
to
majesty
he
jumped
and
swung
her
up
into
the
saddle
now
just
to
see
how
it
ought
to
be
done
watch
florence
said
madeline
the
western
girl
was
at
her
best
in
and
with
her
horse
it
was
beautiful
to
see
the
ease
and
grace
with
which
she
accomplished
the
cowboys
flying
mount
then
she
led
the
party
down
the
slope
and
across
the
flat
to
climb
the
mesa
madeline
never
saw
a
group
of
her
cowboys
without
looking
them
over
almost
unconsciously
for
her
foreman
gene
stewart
this
afternoon
as
usual
he
was
not
present
however
she
now
had
a
sense
of
which
she
was
wholly
conscious
that
she
was
both
disappointed
and
irritated
he
had
really
not
been
attentive
to
her
guests
and
he
of
all
her
cowboys
was
the
one
of
whom
they
wanted
most
to
see
something
helen
particularly
had
asked
to
have
him
attend
the
match
but
stewart
was
with
the
cattle
madeline
thought
of
his
faithfulness
and
was
ashamed
of
her
momentary
lapse
into
that
old
imperious
habit
of
desiring
things
irrespective
of
reason
stewart
however
immediately
slipped
out
of
her
mind
as
she
surveyed
the
group
of
cowboys
on
the
links
by
actual
count
there
were
sixteen
not
including
stillwell
and
the
same
number
of
splendid
horses
all
shiny
and
clean
grazed
on
the
rim
in
the
care
of
mexican
lads
the
cowboys
were
on
looking
very
different
in
madeline
eyes
at
least
from
the
way
cowboys
usually
appeared
but
they
were
real
and
natural
to
her
guests
and
they
were
so
picturesque
that
they
might
have
been
stage
cowboys
instead
of
real
ones
sombreros
with
silver
buckles
and
horsehair
bands
were
in
evidence
and
bright
silk
scarfs
embroidered
vests
fringed
and
ornamented
chaps
huge
swinging
guns
and
clinking
silver
spurs
lent
a
festive
appearance
madeline
and
her
party
were
at
once
eagerly
surrounded
by
the
cowboys
and
she
found
it
difficult
to
repress
a
smile
if
these
cowboys
were
still
remarkable
to
her
what
must
they
be
to
her
guests
wal
raced
over
i
seen
said
stillwell
taking
bridle
get
down

down

guns
mebbe
it
ai
polite
but
it
stewart
stewart
orders
echoed
madeline
her
friends
were
suddenly
silent
i
reckon
he
wo
take
no
chances
on
the
boys
bein
surprised
sudden
by
raiders
an
there
raiders
operatin
in
from
the
guadalupes
all
nothin
to
worry
over
i
was
just
madeline
with
several
of
her
party
expressed
relief
but
helen
showed
excitement
and
then
disappointment
oh
i
want
something
to
happen
she
cried
sixteen
pairs
of
keen
cowboy
eyes
fastened
intently
upon
her
pretty
petulant
face
and
madeline
divined
if
helen
did
not
that
the
desired
consummation
was
not
far
off
so
do
i
said
dot
coombs
it
would
be
perfectly
lovely
to
have
a
real
the
gaze
of
the
sixteen
cowboys
shifted
and
sought
the
demure
face
of
this
other
discontented
girl
madeline
laughed
and
stillwell
wore
his
strange
moving
smile
wal
i
reckon
you
ladies
sure
wo
have
to
go
home
unhappy
he
said
why
as
boss
of
this
heah
outfit
i
feel
myself
disgraced
forever
if
you
did
have
your
wish
just
wait
an

ladies
the
matter

take

of
hobbled
broncs
wal
you

for
the
toornament
they
do
want
my
boys
to
see
how
they
handle
them
crooked
have
you
picked
your
team
inquired
madeline
stillwell
mopped
his
red
face
with
an
immense
bandana
and
showed
something
of
confusion
and
perplexity
i
sixteen
boys
an
they
all
want
to
play
he
replied
pickin
the
team
ai
goin
to
be
an
easy
job
mebbe
it
wo
be

either

nels
and

nick
never

before
nels
all
he
wants
is
to
get
a
crack
at
monty
with
one
of
them
crooked
i
suggest
you
let
all
your
boys
drive
from
the
tee
and
choose
the
two
who
drive
the
farthest
said
madeline
stillwell
perplexed
face
lighted
up
wal
that
a
plumb
good
idee
the
boys
stand
for
wherewith
he
broke
up
the
admiring
circle
of
cowboys
round
the
ladies
grap
a
rope
i
mean
a
club
all
you
an
march
over
hyar
an
take
a
swipe
at
this
little
white
the
cowboys
obeyed
with
alacrity
there
was
considerable
difficulty
over
the
choice
of
clubs
and
who
should
try
first
the
latter
question
had
to
be
adjusted
by
lot
however
after
frankie
slade
made
several
ineffectual
attempts
to
hit
the
ball
from
the
at
last
to
send
it
only
a
few
yards
the
other
players
were
not
so
eager
to
follow
stillwell
had
to
push
booly
forward
and
booly
executed
a
most
miserable
shot
and
retired
to
the
laughing
comments
of
his
comrades
the
efforts
of
several
succeeding
cowboys
attested
to
the
extreme
difficulty
of
making
a
good
drive
wal
nick
it
your
turn
said
stillwell
bill
i
ai
so
particular
about
playin
replied
nick
why
you
was
roarin
about
it
a
little
while
ago
afraid
to
show
how
bad
you
play
nope
jest
plain
consideration
for
my
feller
answered
nick
with
spirit
i
appreciatin
how
bad
they
play
an
i
not
mean
enough
to
show
them
wal
you
got
to
show
me
said
stillwell
i
know
you
never
seen
a
stick
in
your
life
what
more
i
bet
you
ca
hit
that
little
ball
square
not
in
a
dozen
cracks
at
bill
i
also
too
much
of
a
gent
to
take
your
money
but
you
know
from
missouri
gim
me
a
nick
angry
confidence
seemed
to
evaporate
as
one
after
another
he
took
up
and
handled
the
clubs
it
was
plain
that
he
had
never
before
wielded
one
but
also
it
was
plain
that
he
was
not
the
kind
of
a
man
to
give
in
finally
he
selected
a
driver
looked
doubtfully
at
the
small
knob
and
then
stepped
into
position
on
the
nick
steele
stood
six
feet
four
inches
in
height
he
had
the
wiry
slenderness
yet
he
was
broad
of
shoulder
his
arms
were
long
manifestly
he
was
an
exceedingly
powerful
man
he
swung
the
driver
aloft
and
whirled
it
down
with
a
tremendous
swing
crack
the
white
ball
disappeared
and
from
where
it
had
been
rose
a
tiny
cloud
of
dust
madeline
quick
sight
caught
the
ball
as
it
lined
somewhat
to
the
right
it
was
shooting
low
and
level
with
the
speed
of
a
bullet
it
went
up
and
up
in
swift
beautiful
flight
then
lost
its
speed
and
began
to
sail
to
curve
to
drop
and
it
fell
out
of
sight
beyond
the
rim
of
the
mesa
madeline
had
never
seen
a
drive
that
approached
this
one
it
was
magnificent
beyond
belief
except
for
actual
evidence
of
her
own
eyes
the
yelling
of
the
cowboys
probably
brought
nick
steele
out
of
the
astounding
spell
with
which
he
beheld
his
shot
then
nick
suddenly
alive
to
the
situation
recovered
from
his
trance
and
resting
nonchalantly
upon
his
club
he
surveyed
stillwell
and
the
boys
after
their
first
surprised
outburst
they
were
dumb
seen
thet
nick
grandly
waved
his
hand
thaught
i
was
joshin
did
you
why
i
used
to
go
to
louis
an
kansas
city
to
play
this
here
game
there
was
some
talk
of
the
golf
clubs
takin
me
down
east
to
play
the
champions
but
i
never
cared
fer
the
game
too
easy
fer
me
them
fellers
back
in
missouri
were
a
lot
of
cheap
dubs
anyhow
always
kickin
because
whenever
i
hit
a
ball
hard
i
always
lost
it
why
i
hed
to
hit
sort
of
to
let
stay
in
my
class
now
can
go
ahead
an
play
monty
an
link
i
could
beat
both
playin
with
one
hand
if
i
wanted
to
but
i
ai
interested
i
jest
hit
thet
ball
off
the
mesa
to
show
you
i
sure
would
be
seen
on
your
with
that
nick
sauntered
away
toward
the
horses
stillwell
appeared
crushed
and
not
a
scornful
word
was
hurled
after
nick
which
fact
proved
the
nature
of
his
victory
then
nels
strode
into
the
limelight
as
far
as
it
was
possible
for
this
cowboy
to
be
so
he
was
bland
and
suave
he
remarked
to
stillwell
and
the
other
cowboys
that
sometimes
it
was
painful
for
them
to
judge
of
the
gifts
of
superior
cowboys
such
as
belonged
to
nick
and
himself
he
picked
up
the
club
nick
had
used
and
called
for
a
new
ball
stillwell
carefully
built
up
a
little
mound
of
sand
and
placing
the
ball
upon
it
squared
away
to
watch
he
looked
grim
and
expectant
nels
was
not
so
large
a
man
as
nick
and
did
not
look
so
formidable
as
he
waved
his
club
at
the
gaping
cowboys
still
he
was
lithe
tough
strong
briskly
with
a
debonair
manner
he
stepped
up
and
then
delivered
a
mighty
swing
at
the
ball
he
missed
the
power
and
momentum
of
his
swing
flung
him
off
his
feet
and
he
actually
turned
upside
down
and
spun
round
on
his
head
the
cowboys
howled
stillwell
stentorian
laugh
rolled
across
the
mesa
madeline
and
her
guests
found
it
impossible
to
restrain
their
mirth
and
when
nels
got
up
he
cast
a
reproachful
glance
at
madeline
his
feelings
were
hurt
his
second
attempt
not
by
any
means
so
violent
resulted
in
as
clean
a
miss
as
the
first
and
brought
jeers
from
the
cowboys
nels
red
face
flamed
redder
angrily
he
swung
again
the
mound
of
sand
spread
over
the
and
the
exasperating
little
ball
rolled
a
few
inches
this
time
he
had
to
build
up
the
sand
mound
and
replace
the
ball
himself
stillwell
stood
scornfully
by
and
the
boys
addressed
remarks
to
nels
take
off
them
blinders
said
one
nels
your
eyes
are
shore
bad
said
another
you
do
hit
where
you
nels
your
left
eye
has
sprung
a
why
you
old
fule
you
cai
hit
thet
nels
essayed
again
only
to
meet
ignominious
failure
then
carefully
he
gathered
himself
together
gaged
distance
balanced
the
club
swung
cautiously
and
the
head
of
the
club
made
a
beautiful
curve
round
the
ball
shore
it
jest
thet
crooked
club
he
declared
he
changed
clubs
and
made
another
signal
failure
rage
suddenly
possessing
him
he
began
to
swing
wildly
always
it
appeared
the
illusive
little
ball
was
not
where
he
aimed
stillwell
hunched
his
huge
bulk
leaned
hands
on
knees
and
roared
his
riotous
mirth
the
cowboys
leaped
up
and
down
in
glee
you
cai
hit
thet
bawl
sang
out
one
of
the
noisiest
a
few
more
whirling
desperate
lunges
on
the
part
of
nels
all
as
futile
as
if
the
ball
had
been
thin
air
finally
brought
to
the
dogged
cowboy
a
realization
that
golf
was
beyond
him
stillwell
bawled
oh
haw
haw
haw
nels
you
too
old
eyes
no
good
nels
slammed
down
the
club
and
when
he
straightened
up
with
the
red
leaving
his
face
then
the
real
pride
and
fire
of
the
man
showed
deliberately
he
stepped
off
ten
paces
and
turned
toward
the
little
mound
upon
which
rested
the
ball
his
arm
shot
down
elbow
crooked
hand
like
a
claw
aw
nels
this
is
fun
yelled
stillwell
but
swift
as
a
gleam
of
light
nels
flashed
his
gun
and
the
report
came
with
the
action
chips
flew
from
the
as
it
tumbled
from
the
mound
nels
had
hit
it
without
raising
the
dust
then
he
dropped
the
gun
back
in
its
sheath
and
faced
the
cowboys
mebbe
my
eyes
ai
so
orful
bad
he
said
coolly
and
started
to
walk
off
but
look
nels
yelled
stillwell

found
one
of
his
team
the
succeeding
players
however
were
so
poor
and
so
evenly
matched
that
the
earnest
stillwell
was
in
despair
he
lost
his
temper
just
as
speedily
as
nels
had
finally
ed
linton
wife
appeared
riding
up
with
ambrose
wife
and
perhaps
this
helped
for

young

of
admiration
upon
their

a
steer
come
round
an
hit
ed
made
several
attempts
which
although
better
than
those
of
his
predecessors
were
rather
discouraging
to
the
exacting
coach
presently
after
a
particularly
atrocious
shot
stillwell
strode
in
distress
here
and
there
and
finally
stopped
a
dozen
paces
or
more
in
front
of
the
ed
who
for
a
cowboy
was
somewhat
phlegmatic
calmly
made
ready
for
another
attempt

called

ai
it
wal
go
ahaid
an
break
your
ed
linton
was
a
short
heavy
man
and
his
stocky
build
gave
evidence
of
considerable
strength
his
former
strokes
had
not
been
made
at
the
expense
of
exertion
but
now
he
got
ready
for
a
supreme
effort
a
sudden
silence
clamped
down
upon
the
exuberant
cowboys
it
was
one
of
those
fateful
moments
when
the
air
was
charged
with
disaster
as
ed
swung
the
club
it
fairly
whistled
crack
instantly
came
a
thump
but
no
one
saw
the
ball
until
it
dropped
from
stillwell
shrinking
body
his
big
hands
went
spasmodically
to
the
place
that
hurt
and
a
terrible
groan
rumbled
from
him
then
the
cowboys
broke
into
a
frenzy
of
mirth
that
seemed
to
find
adequate
expression
only
in
dancing
and
rolling
accompaniment
to
their
howls
stillwell
recovered
his
dignity
as
soon
as
he
caught
his
breath
and
he
advanced
with
a
rueful
face
wal
boys
it
on
bill
he
said
i
a
livin
proof
of
the
of
mankind
ed
you
win
you
captain
of
the
team
you
hit
straight
an
if
i
had
been
obstructin
the
general
atmosphere
that
ball
would
sure
have
gone
clear
to
the
then
making
a
megaphone
of
his
huge
hands
he
yelled
a
loud
blast
of
defiance
at
monty
and
link
hey
you
swell
we
waitin
come
on
if
you
ai
instantly
monty
and
link
quit
practising
and
like
two
emperors
came
stalking
across
the
links
guess
my
bluff
did
work
much
said
stillwell
then
he
turned
to
madeline
and
her
friends
sure
i
hope
miss
majesty
that
weaken
an
go
over
to
the
enemy
monty
is
some
eloquent
an
besides
he
has
a
way
of
gettin
people
to
agree
with
him
he
be
plumb
wild
when
he
heahs
what
he
an
link
are
up
against
but
it
a
square
deal
because
he
would
help
us
or
lend
the
book
that
shows
how
to
play
an
besides
it
policy
for
us
to
beat
him
now
if
you
elect
to
be
caddies
an
umpire
i
be
powerful
madeline
friends
were
hugely
amused
over
the
prospective
match
but
except
for
dorothy
and
castleton
they
disclaimed
any
ambition
for
active
participation
accordingly
madeline
appointed
castleton
to
judge
the
play
dorothy
to
act
as
caddie
for
ed
linton
and
she
herself
to
be
caddie
for
ambrose
while
stillwell
beamingly
announced
this
momentous
news
to
his
team
and
supporters
monty
and
link
were
striding
up
both
were
diminutive
in
size
lame
in
one
foot
and
altogether
unprepossessing
link
was
young
and
monty
years
more
than
twice
link
had
left
their
mark
but
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
tell
monty
age
as
stillwell
said
monty
was
burned
to
the
color
and
hardness
of
a
cinder
he
never
minded
the
heat
and
always
wore
heavy
sheepskin
chaps
with
the
wool
outside
this
made
him
look
broader
than
he
was
long
link
partial
to
leather
had
since
he
became
chauffeur
taken
to
leather
altogether
he
carried
no
weapon
but
monty
wore
a
huge
and
gun
link
smoked
a
cigarette
and
looked
coolly
impudent
monty
was
swaggering
for
all
the
world
like
a
barbarian
chief
that
monty
makes
my
flesh
creep
said
helen
really
stillwell
is
he
so
bad
desperate
as
i
heard
did
he
ever
kill
anybody
sure
as
many
as
nels
replied
stillwell
cheerfully
oh
and
is
that
nice
nels
a
desperado
too
i
would
have
thought
so
he
so
kind
and
and
nels
is
sure
an
example
of
the
dooplicity
of
men
miss
helen
you
listen
to
his
soft
voice
he
really
as
bad
as
a
at
this
juncture
monty
and
link
reached
the
and
stillwell
went
out
to
meet
them
the
other
cowboys
pressed
forward
to
surround
the
trio
madeline
heard
stillwell
voice
and
evidently
he
was
explaining
that
his
team
was
to
have
skilled
advice
during
the
play
suddenly
there
came
from
the
center
of
the
group
a
loud
angry
roar
that
broke
off
as
suddenly
then
followed
excited
voices
all
mingled
together
presently
monty
appeared
breaking
away
from
restraining
hands
and
he
strode
toward
madeline
monty
price
was
a
type
of
cowboy
who
had
never
been
known
to
speak
to
a
woman
unless
he
was
first
addressed
and
then
he
answered
in
blunt
awkward
shyness
upon
this
great
occasion
however
it
appeared
that
he
meant
to
protest
or
plead
with
madeline
for
he
showed
stress
of
emotion
madeline
had
never
gotten
acquainted
with
monty
she
was
a
little
in
awe
if
not
in
fear
of
him
and
now
she
found
it
imperative
for
her
to
keep
in
mind
that
more
than
any
other
of
the
wild
fellows
on
her
ranch
this
one
should
be
dealt
with
as
if
he
were
a
big
boy
monty
removed
his
sombrero
something
he
had
never
done
before
and
the
single
instant
when
it
was
off
was
long
enough
to
show
his
head
entirely
bald
this
was
one
of
the
of
that
terrible
montana
prairie
fire
through
which
he
had
fought
to
save
the
life
of
a
child
madeline
did
not
forget
it
and
all
at
once
she
wanted
to
take
monty
side
remembering
stillwell
wisdom
however
she
forebore
yielding
to
sentiment
and
called
upon
her
wits
miss
miss
hammond
began
monty
stammering
i
extendin
greetin
to
you
an
your
friends
link
an
me
are
right
down
proud
to
play
the
match
game
with
you
watchin
but
bill
says
you
goin
to
caddie
for
his
team
an
coach
on
the
fine
points
an
i
want
to
ask
all
respectful
if
thet
fair
an
square
monty
that
is
for
you
to
say
replied
madeline
it
was
my
suggestion
but
if
you
object
in
the
least
of
course
we
shall
withdraw
it
seems
fair
to
me
because
you
have
learned
the
game
you
are
expert
and
i
understand
the
other
boys
have
no
chance
with
you
then
you
have
coached
link
i
think
it
would
be
sportsmanlike
of
you
to
accept
the
aw
a
handicap
thet
was
what
bill
was
drivin
at
why
did
he
say
so
every
time
bill
comes
to
a
word
thet
pie
to
us
old
golfers
he
jest
stumbles
miss
majesty
you
made
it
all
clear
as
print
an
i
may
say
with
becomin
modesty
thet
you
was
mistaken
none
about
me
bein
sportsmanlike
me
an
link
was
born
thet
way
an
we
accept
the
handicap
lackin
thet
handicap
i
reckon
link
an
me
would
have
no
ambish
to
play
our
most
game
an
thankin
you
miss
majesty
an
all
your
friends
i
want
to
add
thet
if
bill
outfit
could
beat
us
before
they
got
a
swell
chanct
now
with
you
ladies
me
an
monty
had
seemed
to
expand
with
pride
as
he
delivered
this
speech
and
at
the
end
he
bowed
low
and
turned
away
he
joined
the
group
round
stillwell
once
more
there
was
animated
discussion
and
argument
and
expostulation
one
of
the
cowboys
came
for
castleton
and
led
him
away
to
exploit
upon
ground
rules
it
seemed
to
madeline
that
the
game
never
would
begin
she
strolled
on
the
rim
of
the
mesa
arm
in
arm
with
edith
wayne
and
while
edith
talked
she
looked
out
over
the
gray
valley
leading
to
the
rugged
black
mountains
and
the
vast
red
wastes
in
the
foreground
on
the
gray
slope
she
saw
cattle
in
movement
and
cowboys
riding
to
and
fro
she
thought
of
stewart
then
boyd
harvey
came
for
them
saying
all
details
had
been
arranged
stillwell
met
them
and
this
cool
dry
old
cattleman
whose
face
and
manner
scarcely
changed
at
the
announcement
of
a
now
showed
extreme
agitation
wal
miss
majesty
we
gone
an
made
a
foozle
right
at
the
start
he
said
dejectedly
a
foozle
but
the
game
has
not
yet
begun
replied
madeline
a
bad
start
i
mean
it
amazin
bad
an
we
licked
what
in
the
world
is
wrong
she
wanted
to
laugh
but
stillwell
distress
restrained
her
wal
it
this
way
that
darn
monty
is
as
cute
an
slick
as
a
fox
after
he
got
done
declaimin
about
the
handicap
he
an
link
was
so
happy
to
take
he
got
castleton
over
hyar
an
drove
us
all
dotty
with
his
crazy
names
then
he
borrowed
castleton
coat
i
reckon
borrowed
is
some
kind
word
he
just
about
took
that
blazin
coat
off
the
englishman
though
i
ai
sayin
but
that
casleton
was
agreeable
when
he
tumbled
to
monty
meanin
which
was
nothin
more
to
break
ambrose
heart
that
coat
dazzles
ambrose
you
know
how
vain
ambrose
is
why
he
die
to
get
to
wear
that
englishman
coat
monty
forestalled
him
it
plumb
pitiful
to
see
the
look
in
eyes
he
wo
be
able
to
play
much
then
what
do
you
think
monty

but

disrespectful
but
with
all
doo
respect
to
miss
dorothy
she
has
got
a
pair
of
unbridled
eyes
mebbe
it
just
natural
for
her
to
look
at
a
feller
like
that
oh
it
all
right
i
not
sayin
i
know
it
all
proper
an
regular
for
girls
back
east
to
use
their
eyes
but
out
hyar
it
bound
to
result
disastrous
all
the
boys
talk
about
among
themselves
is
miss
dot
eyes
an
all
they
brag
about
is
which
feller
is
the
luckiest
anyway
sure

an
monty
up
an
told

that
it

see
how
swell
ed
was
prancin
round
under
the
light
of

a
minnit

a
grouch
as
big
as

away
that
settled
ed
he
some
touchy
about
the
way
beulah
henpecks
him
he
lost
his
spirit
an
now
he
could
play
marbles
let
alone
nope
monty
was
too
smart
an
i
reckon
he
was
right
about
brains
bein
what
the
game
began
at
first
madeline
and
dorothy
essayed
to
direct
the
endeavors
of
their
respective
players
but
all
they
said
and
did
only
made
their
team
play
the
worse
at
the
third
hole
they
were
far
behind
and
hopelessly
bewildered
what
with
monty
borrowed
coat
with
its
dazzling
effect
upon
ambrose
and
link
allusion
to
ed
matrimonial
state
and
stillwell
vociferated
disgust
and
the
clamoring
good
intention
and
pursuit
of
the
cowboy
supporters
and
the
embarrassing
presence
of
the
ladies
ambrose
and
ed
wore
through
all
manner
of
strange
play
until
it
became
ridiculous
hey
link
came
monty
voice
booming
over
the
links
our
esteemed
rivals
are
playin
madeline
and
dorothy
gave
up
presently
when
the
game
became
a
rout
and
they
sat
down
with
their
followers
to
watch
the
fun
whether
by
hook
or
crook
ed
and
ambrose
forged
ahead
to
come
close
upon
monty
and
link
castleton
disappeared
in
a
mass
of
gesticulating
shouting
cowboys
when
that
compact
mass
disintegrated
castleton
came
forth
rather
hurriedly
it
appeared
to
stalk
back
toward
his
hostess
and
friends
look
exclaimed
helen
in
delight
castleton
is
actually
excited
whatever
did
they
do
to
him
oh
this
is
immense
castleton
was
excited
indeed
and
also
somewhat
disheveled
by
jove
that
was
a
rum
go
he
said
as
he
came
up
never
saw
such
blooming
golf
i
resigned
my
office
as
only
upon
considerable
pressure
did
he
reveal
the
reason
it
was
like
this
do
you
know
they
were
all
together
over
there
watching
each
other
monty
price
ball
dropped
into
a
hazard
and
he
moved
it
to
improve
the
lie
by
jove
they
all
been
doing
that
but
over
there
the
game
was
waxing
hot
stillwell
and
his
cowboys
saw
monty
move
the
ball
and
there
was
a
row
they
appealed
to
me
i
corrected
the
play
showed
the
rules
monty
agreed
he
was
in
the
wrong
however
when
it
came
to
moving
his
ball
back
to
its
former
lie
in
the
hazard
there
was
more
blooming
trouble
monty
placed
the
ball
to
suit
him
and
then
he
transfixed
me
with
an
evil
eye
he
said
i
wish
the
bloody
cowboy
would
not
call
me
that
mebbe
this
game
ai
as
important
as
international
politics
or
some
other
things
relatin
but
there
some
health
an
peace
on
it
savvy
for
some
space
our
opponents
have
been
dead
to
honor
sportsmanlike
conduct
i
calculate
the
game
depends
on
my
next
drive
i
placin
my
ball
as
near
to
where
it
was
as
human
eyesight
could
you
seen
where
it
was
same
as
i
seen
it
you
the
umpire
an
dook
i
take
you
as
a
honorable
man
moreover
never
in
my
born
days
has
my
word
been
doubted
without
sorrow
so
i
askin
you
was
my
ball
just
about
here
the
bloody
little
desperado
smiled
cheerfully
and
he
dropped
his
right
hand
down
to
the
butt
of
his
gun
by
jove
he
did
then
i
had
to
tell
a
blooming
lie
castleton
even
caught
the
tone
of
monty
voice
but
it
was
plain
that
he
had
not
the
least
conception
that
monty
had
been
fooling
madeline
and
her
friends
divined
it
however
and
there
being
no
need
of
reserve
they
let
loose
the
fountains
of
mirth
xiv
bandits
when
madeline
and
her
party
recovered
composure
they
sat
up
to
watch
the
finish
of
the
match
it
came
with
spectacular
suddenness
a
sharp
yell
pealed
out
and
all
the
cowboys
turned
attentively
in
its
direction
a
big
black
horse
had
surmounted
the
rim
of
the
mesa
and
was
just
breaking
into
a
run
his
rider
yelled
sharply
to
the
cowboys
they
wheeled
to
dash
toward
their
grazing
horses
that
stewart
there
is
something
wrong
said
madeline
in
alarm
castleton
stared
the
other
men
exclaimed
uneasily
the
women
sought
madeline
face
with
anxious
eyes
the
black
got
into
his
stride
and
bore
swiftly
down
upon
them
oh
look
at
that
horse
run
cried
helen
look
at
that
fellow
ride
helen
was
not
alone
in
her
admiration
for
madeline
divided
her
emotions
between
growing
alarm
of
some
danger
menacing
and
a
thrill
and
quickening
of
that
tingled
over
her
whenever
she
saw
stewart
in
violent
action
no
action
of
his
was
any
longer
insignificant
but
violent
action
meant
so
much
it
might
mean
anything
for
one
moment
she
remembered
stillwell
and
all
his
talk
about
fun
and
plots
and
tricks
to
amuse
her
guest
then
she
discountenanced
the
thought
stewart
might
lend
himself
to
a
little
fun
but
he
cared
too
much
for
a
horse
to
run
him
at
that
speed
unless
there
was
imperious
need
that
alone
sufficed
to
answer
madeline
questioning
curiosity
and
her
alarm
mounted
to
fear
not
so
much
for
herself
as
for
her
guests
but
what
danger
could
there
be
she
could
think
of
nothing
except
the
guerrillas
whatever
threatened
it
would
be
met
and
checked
by
this
man
stewart
who
was
thundering
up
on
his
fleet
horse
and
as
he
neared
her
so
that
she
could
see
the
dark
gleam
of
face
and
eyes
she
had
a
strange
feeling
of
trust
in
her
dependence
upon
him
the
big
black
was
so
close
to
madeline
and
her
friends
that
when
stewart
pulled
him
the
dust
and
sand
kicked
up
by
his
pounding
hoofs
flew
in
their
faces
oh
stewart
what
is
it
cried
madeline
guess
i
scared
you
miss
hammond
he
replied
but
i
pressed
for
time
there
a
gang
of
bandits
hiding
on
the
ranch
most
likely
in
a
deserted
hut
they
held
up
a
train
near
agua
prieta
pat
hawe
is
with
the
posse
that
trailing
them
and
you
know
pat
has
no
use
for
us
afraid
it
would
be
pleasant
for
you
or
your
guests
to
meet
either
the
posse
or
the
i
fancy
not
said
madeline
considerably
relieved
we
hurry
back
to
the
they
exchanged
no
more
speech
at
the
moment
and
madeline
guests
were
silent
perhaps
stewart
actions
and
looks
belied
his
calm
words
his
piercing
eyes
roved
round
the
rim
of
the
mesa
and
his
face
was
as
hard
and
stern
as
chiseled
bronze
monty
and
nick
came
galloping
up
each
leading
several
horses
by
the
bridles
nels
appeared
behind
them
with
majesty
and
he
was
having
trouble
with
the
roan
madeline
observed
that
all
the
other
cowboys
had
disappeared
one
sharp
word
from
stewart
calmed
madeline
horse
the
other
horses
however
were
frightened
and
not
inclined
to
stand
the
men
mounted
without
trouble
and
likewise
madeline
and
florence
but
edith
wayne
and
beck
being
nervous
and
almost
helpless
were
with
difficulty
gotten
into
the
saddle
beg
pardon
but
i
pressed
for
time
said
stewart
coolly
as
with
iron
arm
he
forced
dorothy
horse
almost
to
its
knees
dorothy
who
was
active
and
plucky
climbed
astride
and
when
stewart
loosed
his
hold
on
bit
and
mane
the
horse
doubled
up
and
began
to
buck
dorothy
screamed
as
she
shot
into
the
air
stewart
as
quick
as
the
horse
leaped
forward
and
caught
dorothy
in
his
arms
she
had
slipped
head
downward
and
had
he
not
caught
her
would
have
had
a
serious
fall
stewart
handling
her
as
if
she
were
a
child
turned
her
right
side
up
to
set
her
upon
her
feet
dorothy
evidently
thought
only
of
the
spectacle
she
presented
and
made
startled
motions
to
readjust
her
it
was
no
time
to
laugh
though
madeline
felt
as
if
she
wanted
to
besides
it
was
impossible
to
be
anything
but
sober
with
stewart
in
violent
mood
for
he
had
jumped
at
dorothy
stubborn
mount
all
cowboys
were
masters
of
horses
it
was
wonderful
to
see
him
conquer
the
vicious
animal
he
was
cruel
perhaps
yet
it
was
from
necessity
when
presently
he
led
the
horse
back
to
dorothy
she
mounted
without
further
trouble
meanwhile
nels
and
nick
had
lifted
helen
into
her
saddle
we
take
the
side
trail
said
stewart
shortly
as
he
swung
upon
the
big
black
then
he
led
the
way
and
the
other
cowboys
trotted
in
the
rear
it
was
only
a
short
distance
to
the
rim
of
the
mesa
and
when
madeline
saw
the
steep
trail
narrow
and
choked
with
weathered
stone
she
felt
that
her
guests
would
certainly
flinch
that
a
jolly
bad
course
observed
castleton
the
women
appeared
to
be
speechless
stewart
checked
his
horse
at
the
deep
cut
where
the
trail
started
down
boys
drop
over
and
go
slow
he
said
dismounting
flo
you
follow
now
ladies
let
your
horses
loose
and
hold
on
lean
forward
and
hang
to
the
pommel
it
looks
bad
but
the
horses
are
used
to
such
helen
followed
closely
after
florence
beck
went
next
and
then
edith
wayne
dorothy
horse
balked
i
not
so
so
frightened
said
dorothy
if
only
he
would
behave
she
began
to
urge
him
into
the
trail
making
him
rear
when
stewart
grasped
the
bit
and
jerked
the
horse
down
put
your
foot
in
my
stirrup
said
stewart
we
ca
waste
he
lifted
her
upon
his
horse
and
started
him
down
over
the
rim
go
on
miss
hammond
i
have
to
lead
this
nag
down
it
save
then
madeline
attended
to
the
business
of
getting
down
herself
it
was
a
loose
trail
the
weathered
slopes
seemed
to
slide
under
the
feet
of
the
horses
formed
rocks
rolled
and
rattled
down
cactus
spikes
tore
at
horse
and
rider
beck
broke
into
laughter
and
there
was
a
note
in
it
that
suggested
hysteria
once
or
twice
dorothy
murmured
plaintively
half
the
time
madeline
could
not
distinguish
those
ahead
through
the
yellow
dust
it
was
dry
and
made
her
cough
the
horses
snorted
she
heared
stewart
close
behind
starting
little
avalanches
that
kept
rolling
on
majesty
fetlocks
she
feared
his
legs
might
be
cut
or
bruised
for
some
of
the
stones
cracked
by
and
went
rattling
down
the
slope
at
length
the
clouds
of
dust
thinned
and
madeline
saw
the
others
before
her
ride
out
upon
a
level
soon
she
was
down
and
stewart
also
here
there
was
a
delay
occasioned
by
stewart
changing
dorothy
from
his
horse
to
her
own
this
struck
madeline
as
being
singular
and
made
her
thoughtful
in
fact
the
alert
quiet
manner
of
all
the
cowboys
was
not
reassuring
as
they
resumed
the
ride
it
was
noticeable
that
nels
and
nick
were
far
in
advance
monty
stayed
far
in
the
rear
and
stewart
rode
with
the
party
madeline
heard
boyd
harvey
ask
stewart
if
lawlessness
such
as
he
had
mentioned
was
not
unusual
stewart
replied
that
except
for
occasional
deeds
of
outlawry
such
as
might
break
out
in
any
isolated
section
of
the
country
there
had
been
peace
and
quiet
along
the
border
for
years
it
was
the
mexican
revolution
that
had
revived
wild
times
with
all
the
attendant
raids
and
holdups
and
madeline
knew
that
they
were
really
being
escorted
home
under
armed
guard
when
they
rounded
the
head
of
the
mesa
bringing
into
view
the
and
the
valley
madeline
saw
dust
or
smoke
hovering
over
a
hut
upon
the
outskirts
of
the
mexican
quarters
as
the
sun
had
set
and
the
light
was
fading
she
could
not
distinguish
which
it
was
then
stewart
set
a
fast
pace
for
the
house
in
a
few
minutes
the
party
was
in
the
yard
ready
and
willing
to
dismount
stillwell
appeared
ostensibly
cheerful
too
cheerful
to
deceive
madeline
she
noted
also
that
a
number
of
armed
cowboys
were
walking
with
their
horses
just
below
the
house
wal
had
a
nice
little
run
stillwell
said
speaking
generally
i
reckon
there
was
much
need
of
it
pat
hawe
thinks
got
some
outlaws
corralled
on
the
ranch
nothin
at
all
to
be
fussed
up
about
stewart
that
particular
he
wo
have
you
meetin
with
any
many
and
fervent
were
the
expressions
of
relief
from
madeline
feminine
guests
as
they
dismounted
and
went
into
the
house
madeline
lingered
behind
to
speak
with
stillwell
and
stewart
now
stillwell
out
with
it
she
said
briefly
the
cattleman
stared
and
then
he
laughed
evidently
pleased
with
her
keenness
wal
miss
majesty
there
goin
to
be
a
fight
somewhere
an
stewart
wanted
to
get
in
before
it
come
off
he
says
the
overrun
by
vaqueros
an
guerrillas
an
robbers
an
lord
knows
what
he
stamped
off
the
porch
his
huge
spurs
rattling
and
started
down
the
path
toward
the
waiting
men
stewart
stood
in
his
familiar
attentive
position
erect
silent
with
a
hand
on
pommel
and
bridle
stewart
you
are
exceedingly
thoughtful
of
my
interests
she
said
wanting
to
thank
him
and
not
readily
finding
words
i
would
not
know
what
to
do
without
you
is
there
danger
i
not
sure
but
i
want
to
be
on
the
safe
she
hesitated
it
was
no
longer
easy
for
her
to
talk
to
him
and
she
did
not
know
why
may
i
know
the
special
orders
you
gave
nels
and
nick
and
monty
she
asked
who
said
i
gave
those
boys
special
orders
i
heard
stillwell
tell
them
of
course
i
tell
you
if
you
insist
but
why
should
you
worry
over
something
that
likely
never
happen
i
insist
stewart
she
replied
quietly
my
orders
were
that
at
least
one
of
them
must
be
on
guard
near
you
day
and
night
never
to
be
out
of
hearing
of
your
i
thought
as
much
but
why
nels
or
monty
or
nick
that
seems
rather
hard
on
them
for
that
matter
why
put
any
one
to
keep
guard
over
me
do
you
not
trust
any
other
of
my
cowboys
i
trust
their
honesty
but
not
their
ability
of
what
nature
with
stewart
she
exclaimed
miss
hammond
you
have
been
having
such
a
good
time
entertaining
your
guests
that
you
forget
i
glad
of
that
i
wish
you
had
not
questioned
forget
what
don
carlos
and
his
indeed
i
have
not
forgotten
stewart
you
still
think
don
carlos
tried
to
make
off
with
me
may
try
it
again
i
do
think
i
and
besides
all
your
other
duties
you
have
shared
the
watch
with
these
three
cowboys
it
has
been
going
on
without
my
knowledge
since
when
since
i
brought
you
down
from
the
mountains
last
how
long
is
it
to
continue
that
hard
to
say
till
the
revolution
is
over
she
mused
a
moment
looking
away
to
the
west
where
the
great
void
was
filling
with
red
haze
she
believed
implicitly
in
him
and
the
menace
hovering
near
her
fell
like
a
shadow
upon
her
present
happiness
what
must
i
do
she
asked
i
think
you
ought
to
send
your
friends
back
east
and
go
with
them
until
this
guerrilla
war
is
why
stewart
they
would
be
and
so
would
he
had
no
reply
for
that
if
i
do
not
take
your
advice
it
will
be
the
first
time
since
i
have
come
to
look
to
you
for
so
much
she
went
on
can
not
you
suggest
something
else
my
friends
are
having
such
a
splendid
visit
helen
is
getting
well
oh
i
should
be
sorry
to
see
them
go
before
they
want
we
might
take
them
up
into
the
mountains
and
camp
out
for
a
while
he
said
presently
i
know
a
wild
place
up
among
the
crags
it
a
hard
climb
but
worth
the
work
i
never
saw
a
more
beautiful
spot
fine
water
and
it
will
be
cool
pretty
soon
it
be
too
hot
here
for
your
party
to
go
you
mean
to
hide
me
away
among
the
crags
and
clouds
replied
madeline
with
a
laugh
well
it
amount
to
that
your
friends
need
not
know
perhaps
in
a
few
weeks
this
spell
of
trouble
on
the
border
will
be
over
till
you
say
it
a
hard
climb
up
to
this
place
it
surely
is
your
friends
will
get
the
real
thing
if
they
make
that
that
suits
me
helen
especially
wants
something
to
happen
and
they
are
all
crazy
for
they
get
it
up
there
bad
trails
canyons
to
head
steep
climbs
thunder
and
lightning
rain
and
very
well
i
am
decided
stewart
of
course
you
will
take
charge
i
do
believe
i
stewart
is
there
something
more
you
could
tell
me
why
you
think
why
you
know
my
own
personal
liberty
is
in
peril
yes
but
do
not
ask
me
what
it
is
if
i
had
been
a
rebel
soldier
i
would
never
have
if
you
had
not
been
a
rebel
soldier
where
would
madeline
hammond
be
now
she
asked
earnestly
he
made
no
reply
stewart
she
continued
with
warm
impulse
you
once
mentioned
a
debt
you
owed
me
and
seeing
his
dark
face
pale
she
wavered
then
went
on
it
is
no
no
he
answered
huskily
yes
i
will
not
have
it
no
that
never
can
be
madeline
held
out
her
hand
it
is
paid
i
tell
you
she
repeated
suddenly
he
drew
back
from
the
outstretched
white
hand
that
seemed
to
fascinate
him
i
kill
a
man
to
touch
your
hand
but
i
wo
touch
it
on
the
terms
you
his
unexpected
passion
disconcerted
her
stewart
no
man
ever
before
refused
to
shake
hands
with
me
for
any
reason
it
it
is
scarcely
flattering
she
said
with
a
little
laugh
why
wo
you
because
you
think
i
offer
it
as
mistress
to
servant
rancher
to
cowboy
then
why
the
debt
you
owed
me
is
paid
i
cancel
it
so
why
not
shake
hands
upon
it
as
men
do
i
wo
that
i
fear
you
are
ungracious
whatever
your
reason
she
replied
still
i
may
offer
it
again
some
day
good
he
said
good
night
and
turned
madeline
wonderingly
watched
him
go
down
the
path
with
his
hand
on
the
black
horse
neck
she
went
in
to
rest
a
little
before
dressing
for
dinner
and
being
fatigued
from
the
day
riding
and
excitement
she
fell
asleep
when
she
awoke
it
was
twilight
she
wondered
why
her
mexican
maid
had
not
come
to
her
and
she
rang
the
bell
the
maid
did
not
put
in
an
appearance
nor
was
there
any
answer
to
the
ring
the
house
seemed
unusually
quiet
it
was
a
brooding
silence
which
presently
broke
to
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
porch
madeline
recognized
stillwell
tread
though
it
appeared
to
be
light
for
him
then
she
heard
him
call
softly
in
at
the
open
door
of
her
office
the
suggestion
of
caution
in
his
voice
suited
the
strangeness
of
his
walk
with
a
boding
sense
of
trouble
she
hurried
through
the
rooms
he
was
standing
outside
her
office
door
stillwell
she
exclaimed
anybody
with
you
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
please
come
out
on
the
porch
he
added
she
complied
and
once
out
was
enabled
to
see
him
his
grave
face
paler
than
she
had
ever
beheld
it
caused
her
to
stretch
an
appealing
hand
toward
him
stillwell
intercepted
it
and
held
it
in
his
own
miss
majesty
i
amazin
sorry
to
tell
worrisome
he
spoke
almost
in
a
whisper
cautiously
looked
about
him
and
seemed
both
hurried
and
mysterious
if
you
heerd
stewart
cuss
you
sure
know
how
we
hate
to
hev
to
tell
you
this
but
it
ca
be
avoided
the
fact
is
we
in
a
bad
fix
if
your
guests
ai
scared
out
of
their
skins
be
owin
to
your
nerve
an
how
you
carry
out
stewart
you
can
rely
upon
me
replied
madeline
firmly
though
she
trembled
wal
what
we
up
against
is
this
that
gang
of
bandits
pat
hawe
was
chasin
they
hidin
in
the
house
in
the
house
echoed
madeline
aghast
miss
majesty
it
the
amazin
truth
an
shamed
indeed
am
i
to
admit
it
stewart
why
he
wild
with
rage
to
think
it
could
hev
happened
you
see
it
could
hev
happened
if
i
hed
sloped
the
boys
off
to
the
an
if
stewart
hed
rid
out
on
the
mesa
after
us
my
fault
i
hed
too
much
femininity
around
fer
my
old
haid
gene
cussed
me
he
cussed
me
sure
scandalous
but
now
we
got
to
face
it
to
do
you
mean
that
a
gang
of
hunted
outlaws
bandits
have
actually
taken
refuge
somewhere
in
my
house
demanded
madeline
i
sure
do
seems
powerful
strange
to
me
why
you
did
find
was
wrong
seem
all
your
servants
hev
gone
ah
i
missed
my
maid
i
wondered
why
no
lights
were
lit
where
did
my
servants
go
down
to
the
mexican
quarters
an
scared
half
to
death
now
listen
when
stewart
left
you
an
hour
or
so
ago
he
follered
me
direct
to
where
me
an
the
boys
was
tryin
to
keep
pat
hawe
from
tearin
the
ranch
to
pieces
at
that
we
was
helpin
pat
all
we
could
to
find
them
bandits
but
when
stewart
got
there
he
made
a
difference
pat
was
nasty
before
but
seein
stewart
made
him
wuss
i
reckon
gene
to
pat
is
the
same
as
red
to
a
greaser
bull
anyway
when
the
sheriff
set
fire
to
an
old
adobe
hut
stewart
called
him
an
called
him
hard
pat
hawe
hed
six
fellers
with
him
an
from
all
appearances
was
some
fiesta
there
was
a
row
an
looked
bad
fer
a
little
but
gene
was
cool
an
he
controlled
the
boys
then
pat
an
his
tough
went
on
huntin
that
huntin
miss
majesty
petered
out
into
what
was
only
a
farce
i
reckon
pat
could
hev
kept
on
foolin
me
an
the
boys
but
as
soon
as
stewart
showed
up
on
the
scene
wal
either
pat
got
to
blunderin
or
else
shed
our
blinders
anyway
the
facts
stood
plain
pat
hawe
was
lookin
hard
fer
any
bandits
he
was
daid
set
anythin
unless
it
was
trouble
fer
stewart
finally
when
pat
men
made
fer
our
storehouse
where
we
keep
ammunition
grub
liquors
sich
then
gene
called
a
halt
an
he
ordered
pat
hawe
off
the
ranch
it
was
hyar
hawe
an
stewart
locked
horns
an
hyar
the
truth
come
out
there
was
a
gang
of
bandits
hid
somewheres
an
at
fust
pat
hawe
hed
been
powerful
active
an
earnest
in
his
huntin
but
he
fetched
a
pecooliar
change
of
heart
he
had
been
some
flustered
with
stewart
eyes
into
his
moves
an
then
mebbe
to
hide
somethin
mebbe
jest
he
got
mad
he
hollered
law
he
pulled
down
off
the
shelf
his
old
stock
grudge
on
stewart
accusin
him
over
again
of
that
greaser
murder
last
fall
stewart
made
him
look
like
a
fool
showed
him
up
as
bein
scared
of
the
bandits
or
hevin
some
reason
fer
slopin
off
the
trail
anyway
the
row
started
all
right
an
but
fer
nels
it
might
hev
amounted
to
a
fight
in
the
thick
of
it
when
stewart
was
drivin
pat
an
his
crowd
off
the
place
one
of
them
lost
his
head
an
went
fer
his
gun
nels
throwed
his
gun
an
crippled
the
feller
arm
monty
jumped
then
throwed
two
an
fer
a
second
or
so
it
looked
ticklish
but
the
crawled
an
then
lit
stillwell
paused
in
the
rapid
delivery
of
his
narrative
he
still
retained
madeline
hand
as
if
by
that
he
might
comfort
her
after
pat
left
we
put
our
haids
together
began
the
old
cattleman
with
a
long
respiration
we
rounded
up
a
lad
who
hed
seen
a
dozen
or
so
fellers
he
would
to
they
was
greasers
breakin
through
the
shrubbery
to
the
back
of
the
house
that
was
while
stewart
was
out
to
the
mesa
then
this
lad
seen
your
servants
all
runnin
down
the
hill
toward
the
village
now
heah
the
way
gene
figgers
there
sure
was
some
deviltry
down
along
the
railroad
an
pat
hawe
trailed
bandits
up
to
the
ranch
he
hunts
hard
an
then
all
to
onct
he
quits
stewart
says
pat
hawe
was
scared
but
he
discovered
signs
or
somethin
or
got
wind
in
some
strange
way
that
there
was
in
the
gang
of
bandits
some
fellers
he
did
want
to
ketch
sabe
then
gene
quicker
a
flash
springs
his
plan
on
me
he
go
down
to
padre
marcos
an
hev
him
help
to
find
out
all
possible
from
your
mexican
servants
i
was
to
hurry
up
hyar
an
tell
you
give
you
orders
miss
majesty
ai
that
amazin
strange
wal
you
to
assemble
all
your
guests
in
the
kitchen
make
a
grand
bluff
an
pretend
as
your
help
has
left
that
it
be
great
fun
fer
your
guests
to
cook
dinner
the
kitchen
is
the
safest
room
in
the
house
while
you
joshin
your
party
along
makin
a
kind
of
picnic
out
of
it
i
place
cowboys
in
the
long
corridor
an
also
outside
in
the
corner
where
the
kitchen
joins
on
to
the
main
house
it
pretty
sure
the
bandits
think
no
one
wise
to
where
they
hid
stewart
says
they
in
that
end
room
where
the
alfalfa
is
an
they
slope
in
the
night
of
course
with
me
an
the
boys
watchin
will
be
safe
to
go
to
bed
an
we
to
rouse
your
guests
early
before
daylight
to
hit
the
trail
up
into
the
mountains
tell
them
to
pack
outfits
before
to
bed
say
as
your
servants
hev
sloped
you
might
as
well
go
with
the
cowboys
that
all
if
we
hev
any
luck
your
friends
never
know
they
been
sittin
on
a
stillwell
do
you
advise
that
trip
up
into
the
mountains
asked
madeline
i
reckon
i
do
considerin
everythin
now
miss
majesty
i
used
up
a
lot
of
time
explainin
you
sure
keep
your
nerve
yes
madeline
replied
and
was
surprised
at
herself
better
tell
florence
she
be
a
power
of
comfort
to
you
i
goin
now
to
fetch
up
the
instead
of
returning
to
her
room
madeline
went
through
the
office
into
the
long
corridor
it
was
almost
as
dark
as
night
she
fancied
she
saw
a
figure
darker
than
the
surrounding
gloom
and
she
entered
upon
the
fulfilment
of
her
part
of
the
plan
in
something
like
trepidation
her
footsteps
were
noiseless
finding
the
door
to
the
kitchen
and
going
in
she
struck
lights
upon
passing
out
again
she
made
certain
she
discerned
a
dark
shape
now
motionless
crouching
along
the
wall
but
she
mistrusted
her
vivid
imagination
it
took
all
her
boldness
to
enable
her
unconcernedly
and
naturally
to
strike
the
corridor
light
then
she
went
on
through
her
own
rooms
and
thence
into
the
patio
her
guests
laughingly
and
gladly
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
occasion
madeline
fancied
her
deceit
must
have
been
perfect
seeing
that
it
deceived
even
florence
they
trooped
merrily
into
the
kitchen
madeline
delaying
at
the
door
took
a
sharp
but
unobtrusive
glance
down
the
great
barnlike
hall
she
saw
nothing
but
blank
dark
space
suddenly
from
one
side
not
a
rod
distant
protruded
a
pale
gleaming
face
breaking
the
even
blackness
instantly
it
flashed
back
out
of
sight
yet
that
time
was
long
enough
for
madeline
to
see
a
pair
of
glittering
eyes
and
to
recognize
them
as
don
carlos
without
betraying
either
hurry
or
alarm
she
closed
the
door
it
had
a
heavy
bolt
which
she
slowly
noiselessly
shot
then
the
cold
amaze
that
had
all
but
stunned
her
into
inaction
throbbed
into
wrath
how
dared
that
mexican
steal
into
her
home
what
did
he
mean
was
he
one
of
the
bandits
supposed
to
be
hidden
in
her
house
she
was
thinking
herself
into
greater
anger
and
excitement
and
probably
would
have
betrayed
herself
had
not
florence
who
had
evidently
seen
her
bolt
the
door
and
now
read
her
thoughts
come
toward
her
with
a
bright
intent
questioning
look
madeline
caught
herself
in
time
thereupon
she
gave
each
of
her
guests
a
duty
to
perform
leading
florence
into
the
pantry
she
unburdened
herself
of
the
secret
in
one
brief
whisper
florence
reply
was
to
point
out
of
the
little
open
window
passing
which
was
a
file
of
stealthily
moving
cowboys
then
madeline
lost
both
anger
and
fear
retaining
only
the
glow
of
excitement
madeline
could
be
gay
and
she
initiated
the
abandonment
of
dignity
by
calling
castleton
into
the
pantry
and
while
interesting
him
in
some
pretext
or
other
imprinting
the
outlines
of
her
hands
upon
the
back
of
his
black
coat
castleton
innocently
returned
to
the
kitchen
to
be
greeted
with
a
roar
that
surprising
act
of
the
hostess
set
the
pace
and
there
followed
a
merry
noisy
time
everybody
helped
the
miscellaneous
collection
of
dishes
so
confusingly
contrived
made
up
a
dinner
which
they
all
heartily
enjoyed
madeline
enjoyed
it
herself
even
with
the
feeling
of
a
sword
hanging
suspended
over
her
the
hour
was
late
when
she
rose
from
the
table
and
told
her
guests
to
go
to
their
rooms
don
their
pack
what
they
needed
for
the
long
and
adventurous
camping
trip
that
she
hoped
would
be
the
climax
of
their
western
experience
and
to
snatch
a
little
sleep
before
the
cowboys
roused
them
for
the
early
start
madeline
went
immediately
to
her
room
and
was
getting
out
her
camping
apparel
when
a
knock
interrupted
her
she
thought
florence
had
come
to
help
her
pack
but
this
knock
was
upon
the
door
opening
out
in
the
porch
it
was
repeated
who
there
she
questioned
stewart
came
the
reply
she
opened
the
door
he
stood
on
the
threshold
beyond
him
indistinct
in
the
gloom
were
several
cowboys
may
i
speak
to
you
he
asked
she
hesitated
a
moment
then
asked
him
in
and
closed
the
door
is
is
everything
all
right
no
these
bandits
stick
to
cover
pretty
close
they
must
have
found
out
we
on
the
watch
but
i
sure
we
get
you
and
your
friends
away
before
anything
starts
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
talked
with
your
servants
they
were
just
scared
they
come
back
soon
as
bill
gets
rid
of
this
gang
you
need
not
worry
about
them
or
your
do
you
have
any
idea
who
is
hiding
in
the
house
i
was
worried
some
at
first
pat
hawe
acted
queer
i
imagined
discovered
he
was
trailing
bandits
who
might
turn
out
to
be
his
smuggling
guerrilla
cronies
but
talking
with
your
servants
finding
a
bunch
of
horses
upon
hidden
down
in
the
mesquite
behind
the
pond
several
things
have
changed
my
mind
my
idea
is
that
a
cowardly
handful
of
riffraff
outcasts
from
the
border
have
hidden
in
your
house
more
by
accident
than
design
we
let
them
go
get
rid
of
them
without
even
a
shot
if
i
did
think
so
well
i
be
considerably
worried
it
would
make
a
different
state
of
stewart
you
are
wrong
she
said
he
started
but
his
reply
did
not
follow
swiftly
the
expression
of
his
eyes
altered
presently
he
spoke
how
so
i
saw
one
of
these
bandits
i
distinctly
recognized
one
long
step
brought
him
close
to
her
who
was
he
demanded
stewart
don
he
muttered
low
and
deep
then
said
are
you
sure
absolutely
i
saw
his
figure
twice
in
the
hall
then
his
face
in
the
light
i
could
never
mistake
his
did
he
know
you
saw
him
i
am
not
positive
but
i
think
so
oh
he
must
have
known
i
was
standing
full
in
the
light
i
had
entered
the
door
then
purposely
stepped
out
his
face
showed
from
around
a
corner
and
swiftly
flashed
out
of
madeline
was
tremblingly
conscious
that
stewart
underwent
a
transformation
she
saw
as
well
as
felt
the
leaping
passion
that
changed
him
call
your
friends
get
them
in
here
he
ordered
tersely
and
wheeled
toward
the
door
stewart
wait
she
said
he
turned
his
white
face
his
burning
eyes
his
presence
now
charged
with
definite
fearful
meaning
influenced
her
strangely
weakened
her
what
will
you
do
she
asked
that
need
concern
you
get
your
party
in
here
bar
the
windows
and
lock
the
doors
you
be
stewart
tell
me
what
you
intend
to
i
wo
tell
you
he
replied
and
turned
away
again
but
i
will
know
she
said
with
a
hand
on
his
arm
she
detained
him
she
saw
how
he
halted
felt
the
shock
in
him
as
she
touched
him
oh
i
do
know
you
mean
to
fight
well
miss
hammond
is
it
about
time
he
asked
evidently
he
overcame
a
violent
passion
for
instant
action
there
was
weariness
dignity
even
reproof
in
his
question
the
fact
of
that
presence
here
in
your
house
ought
to
prove
to
you
the
nature
of
the
case
these
vaqueros
these
guerrillas
have
found
out
you
wo
stand
for
any
fighting
on
the
part
of
your
men
don
carlos
is
a
sneak
a
coward
yet
he
not
afraid
to
hide
in
your
own
house
he
has
learned
you
wo
let
your
cowboys
hurt
anybody
he
taking
advantage
of
it
he
rob
burn
and
make
off
with
you
he
murder
too
if
it
falls
his
way
these
greasers
use
knives
in
the
dark
so
i
ask
is
it
about
time
we
stop
him
stewart
i
forbid
you
to
fight
unless
in
i
forbid
what
i
mean
to
do
is
have
i
tried
to
explain
to
you
that
just
now
we
wild
times
along
this
stretch
of
border
must
i
tell
you
again
that
don
carlos
is
hand
and
glove
with
the
revolution
the
rebels
are
crazy
to
stir
up
the
united
states
you
are
a
woman
of
prominence
don
carlos
would
make
off
with
you
if
he
got
you
what
little
matter
to
cross
the
border
with
you
well
where
would
the
hue
and
cry
go
through
the
troops
along
the
border
to
new
york
to
washington
why
it
would
mean
what
the
rebels
are
working
for
united
states
intervention
in
other
words
war
oh
surely
you
exaggerate
she
cried
maybe
so
but
i
beginning
to
see
the
don
game
and
miss
hammond
i
it
awful
for
me
to
think
what
you
suffer
if
don
carlos
got
you
over
the
line
i
know
these
mexicans
i
been
among
the
peons
the
stewart
do
let
don
carlos
get
me
replied
madeline
in
sweet
directness
she
saw
him
shake
saw
his
throat
swell
as
he
swallowed
hard
saw
the
hard
fierceness
return
to
his
face
i
wo
that
why
i
going
after
but
i
forbade
you
to
start
a
fight
then
i
go
ahead
and
start
one
without
your
permission
he
replied
shortly
and
again
he
wheeled
this
time
when
madeline
caught
his
arm
she
held
to
it
even
after
he
stopped
no
she
said
imperiously
he
shook
off
her
hand
and
strode
forward
please
do
go
she
called
beseechingly
but
he
kept
on
stewart
she
ran
ahead
of
him
intercepted
him
faced
him
with
her
back
against
the
door
he
swept
out
a
long
arm
as
if
to
brush
her
aside
but
it
wavered
and
fell
haggard
troubled
with
working
face
he
stood
before
her
it
for
your
sake
he
expostulated
if
it
is
for
my
sake
then
do
what
pleases
these
guerrillas
will
knife
somebody
they
burn
the
house
make
off
with
you
they
do
something
bad
unless
we
stop
let
us
risk
all
that
she
importuned
but
it
a
terrible
risk
and
it
ought
be
run
he
exclaimed
passionately
i
know
best
here
stillwell
upholds
me
let
me
out
miss
hammond
i
going
to
take
the
boys
and
go
after
these
no
good
heavens
exclaimed
stewart
why
not
let
me
go
it
the
thing
to
do
i
sorry
to
distress
you
and
your
guests
why
not
put
an
end
to
don
carlos
badgering
is
it
because
you
afraid
a
rumpus
will
spoil
your
friends
visit
it
is
not
this
then
it
the
idea
of
a
little
shooting
at
these
greasers
you
sick
to
think
of
a
little
greaser
blood
staining
the
halls
of
your
home
no
well
then
why
keep
me
from
doing
what
i
know
is
best
stewart
i
i
she
faltered
in
growing
agitation
frightened
confused
all
this
is
too
too
much
for
me
i
not
a
coward
if
you
have
to
fight
you
see
i
not
a
coward
but
your
way
seems
so
reckless
that
hall
is
so
dark
the
guerrillas
would
shoot
from
behind
doors
you
so
wild
so
daring
you
rush
right
into
peril
is
that
necessary
i
think
i
mean
i
do
know
just
why
i
feel
so
so
about
you
doing
it
but
i
believe
it
because
i
afraid
you
you
might
be
you
afraid
i
i
might
be
hurt
he
echoed
wonderingly
the
hard
whiteness
of
his
face
warming
flushing
glowing
the
single
word
with
all
it
might
mean
with
all
it
might
not
mean
softened
him
as
if
by
magic
made
him
gentle
amazed
shy
as
a
boy
stifling
under
a
torrent
of
emotions
madeline
thought
she
had
persuaded
him
worked
her
will
with
him
then
another
of
his
startlingly
sudden
moves
told
her
that
she
had
reckoned
too
quickly
this
move
was
to
put
her
firmly
aside
so
he
could
pass
and
madeline
seeing
he
would
not
hesitate
to
lift
her
out
of
the
way
surrendered
the
door
he
turned
on
the
threshold
his
face
was
still
working
but
the
gleam
of
his
eyes
indicated
the
return
of
that
cowboy
ruthlessness
i
going
to
drive
don
carlos
and
his
gang
out
of
the
house
declared
stewart
i
think
i
may
promise
you
to
do
it
without
a
fight
but
if
it
takes
a
fight
off
he
goes
xv
the
mountain
trail
as
stewart
departed
from
one
door
florence
knocked
upon
another
and
madeline
far
shaken
out
of
her
usual
serenity
admitted
the
cool
western
girl
with
more
than
gladness
just
to
have
her
near
helped
madeline
to
get
back
her
balance
she
was
conscious
of
florence
sharp
scrutiny
then
of
a
sweet
deliberate
change
of
manner
florence
might
have
been
burning
with
curiosity
to
know
more
about
the
bandits
hidden
in
the
house
the
plans
of
the
cowboys
the
reason
for
suppressed
emotion
but
instead
of
asking
madeline
questions
she
introduced
the
important
subject
of
what
to
take
on
the
camping
trip
for
an
hour
they
discussed
the
need
of
this
and
that
article
selected
those
things
most
needful
and
then
packed
them
in
that
done
they
decided
to
lie
down
fully
dressed
as
they
were
in
and
sleep
or
at
least
rest
the
little
remaining
time
left
before
the
call
to
saddle
madeline
turned
out
the
light
and
peeping
through
her
window
saw
dark
forms
standing
in
the
gloom
when
she
lay
down
she
heard
soft
steps
on
the
path
this
fidelity
to
her
swelled
her
heart
while
the
need
of
it
presaged
that
fearful
something
which
since
stewart
passionate
appeal
to
her
haunted
her
as
inevitable
madeline
did
not
expect
to
sleep
yet
she
did
sleep
and
it
seemed
to
have
been
only
a
moment
until
florence
called
her
she
followed
florence
outside
it
was
the
dark
hour
before
dawn
she
could
discern
saddled
horses
being
held
by
cowboys
there
was
an
air
of
hurry
and
mystery
about
the
departure
helen
who
came
out
with
other
guests
whispered
that
it
was
like
an
escape
she
was
delighted
the
others
were
amused
to
madeline
it
was
indeed
an
escape
in
the
darkness
madeline
could
not
see
how
many
escorts
her
party
was
to
have
she
heard
low
voices
the
champing
of
bits
and
thumping
of
hoofs
and
she
recognized
stewart
when
he
led
up
majesty
for
her
to
mount
then
came
a
pattering
of
soft
feet
and
the
whining
of
dogs
cold
noses
touched
her
hands
and
she
saw
the
long
gray
shaggy
shapes
of
her
pack
of
russian
that
stewart
meant
to
let
them
go
with
her
was
indicative
of
how
he
studied
her
pleasure
she
loved
to
be
out
with
the
hounds
and
her
horse
stewart
led
majesty
out
into
the
darkness
past
a
line
of
mounted
horses
guess
we
ready
he
said
i
make
the
he
went
back
along
the
line
and
on
the
return
madeline
heard
him
say
several
times
now
everybody
ride
close
to
the
horse
in
front
and
keep
quiet
till
then
the
snorting
and
pounding
of
the
big
black
horse
in
front
of
her
told
madeline
that
stewart
had
mounted
all
right
we
off
he
called
madeline
lifted
majesty
bridle
and
let
the
roan
go
there
was
a
crack
and
crunch
of
gravel
fire
struck
from
stone
a
low
whinny
a
snort
and
then
steady
short
of
iron
hoofs
on
hard
ground
madeline
could
just
discern
stewart
and
his
black
outlined
in
shadowy
gray
before
her
yet
they
were
almost
within
touching
distance
once
or
twice
one
of
the
huge
leaped
up
at
her
and
whined
joyously
a
thick
belt
of
darkness
lay
low
and
seemed
to
thin
out
above
to
a
gray
fog
through
which
a
few
wan
stars
showed
it
was
altogether
an
unusual
departure
from
the
ranch
and
madeline
always
susceptible
even
to
ordinary
incident
that
promised
well
now
found
herself
thrillingly
sensitive
to
the
soft
beat
of
hoofs
the
feel
of
cool
moist
air
the
dim
sight
of
stewart
dark
figure
the
caution
the
early
start
before
dawn
the
enforced
silence
these
lent
the
occasion
all
that
was
needful
to
make
it
stirring
majesty
plunged
into
a
gully
where
sand
and
rough
going
made
madeline
stop
romancing
to
attend
to
riding
in
the
darkness
stewart
was
not
so
easy
to
keep
close
to
even
on
smooth
trails
and
now
she
had
to
be
watchfully
attentive
to
do
it
then
followed
a
long
march
through
dragging
sand
meantime
the
blackness
gradually
changed
to
gray
at
length
majesty
climbed
out
of
the
wash
and
once
more
his
iron
shoes
rang
on
stone
he
began
to
climb
the
figure
of
stewart
and
his
horse
loomed
more
distinctly
in
madeline
sight
bending
over
she
tried
to
see
the
trail
but
could
not
she
wondered
how
stewart
could
follow
a
trail
in
the
dark
his
eyes
must
be
as
piercing
as
they
sometimes
looked
over
her
shoulder
madeline
could
not
see
the
horse
behind
her
but
she
heard
him
as
majesty
climbed
steadily
madeline
saw
the
gray
darkness
grow
opaque
change
and
lighten
lose
its
substance
and
yield
the
grotesque
shapes
of
yucca
and
ocotillo
dawn
was
about
to
break
madeline
imagined
she
was
facing
east
still
she
saw
no
brightening
of
sky
all
at
once
to
her
surprise
stewart
and
his
powerful
horse
stood
clear
in
her
sight
she
saw
the
characteristic
rock
and
cactus
and
brush
that
covered
the
foothills
the
trail
was
old
and
seldom
used
and
it
zigzagged
and
turned
and
twisted
looking
back
she
saw
the
short
squat
figure
of
monty
price
humped
over
his
saddle
monty
face
was
hidden
under
his
sombrero
behind
him
rode
dorothy
coombs
and
next
loomed
up
the
lofty
form
of
nick
steele
madeline
and
the
members
of
her
party
were
riding
between
cowboy
escorts
bright
daylight
came
and
madeline
saw
the
trail
was
leading
up
through
foothills
it
led
in
a
way
through
shallow
gullies
full
of
stone
and
brush
washed
down
by
floods
at
every
turn
now
madeline
expected
to
come
upon
water
and
the
waiting
but
time
passed
and
miles
of
climbing
and
no
water
or
horses
were
met
expectation
in
madeline
gave
place
to
desire
she
was
hungry
presently
stewart
horse
went
splashing
into
a
shallow
pool
beyond
that
damp
places
in
the
sand
showed
here
and
there
and
again
more
water
in
rocky
pockets
stewart
kept
on
it
was
eight
by
watch
when
upon
turning
into
a
wide
hollow
she
saw
horses
grazing
on
spare
grass
a
great
pile
of
bundles
and
a
fire
round
which
cowboys
and
two
mexican
women
were
busy
madeline
sat
her
horse
and
reviewed
her
followers
as
they
rode
up
single
file
her
guests
were
in
merry
mood
and
they
all
talked
at
once
breakfast
and
rustle
called
out
stewart
without
ceremony
no
need
to
tell
me
to
rustle
said
helen
i
am
simply
ravenous
this
air
makes
me
for
that
matter
madeline
observed
helen
did
not
show
any
marked
contrast
to
the
others
the
hurry
order
however
did
not
interfere
with
the
meal
being
somewhat
in
the
nature
of
a
picnic
while
they
ate
and
talked
and
laughed
the
cowboys
were
packing
horses
and
burros
and
throwing
the
a
procedure
so
interesting
to
castleton
that
he
got
up
with
in
hand
and
tramped
from
one
place
to
another
heard
of
that
he
observed
to
a
cowboy
bally
nice
little
job
as
soon
as
the
was
in
readiness
stewart
started
it
off
in
the
lead
to
break
trail
a
heavy
growth
of
shrub
interspersed
with
rock
and
cactus
covered
the
slopes
and
now
all
the
trail
appeared
to
be
uphill
it
was
not
a
question
of
comfort
for
madeline
and
her
party
for
comfort
was
impossible
it
was
a
matter
of
making
the
travel
possible
for
him
florence
wore
corduroy
breeches
and
boots
and
the
advantage
of
this
masculine
garb
was
at
once
in
evidence
the
of
the
other
ladies
suffered
considerably
from
the
sharp
spikes
it
took
all
madeline
watchfulness
to
save
her
horse
legs
to
pick
the
best
bits
of
open
ground
to
make
from
the
trail
and
to
protect
herself
from
outreaching
thorny
branches
so
that
the
time
sped
by
without
her
knowing
it
the
forged
ahead
and
the
trailing
couples
grew
farther
apart
at
noon
they
got
out
of
the
foothills
to
face
the
real
ascent
of
the
mountains
the
sun
beat
down
hot
there
was
little
breeze
and
the
dust
rose
thick
and
hung
in
a
pall
the
view
was
restricted
and
what
scenery
lay
open
to
the
eye
was
dreary
and
drab
a
barren
monotony
of
slopes
ridged
by
rocky
canyons
once
stewart
waited
for
madeline
and
as
she
came
up
he
said
we
going
to
have
a
that
will
be
a
relief
it
so
hot
and
dusty
replied
madeline
shall
i
call
a
halt
and
make
camp
here
oh
no
what
do
you
think
best
well
if
we
have
a
good
healthy
it
will
be
something
new
for
your
friends
i
think
we
be
wise
to
keep
on
the
go
there
no
place
to
make
a
good
camp
the
wind
would
blow
us
off
this
slope
if
the
rain
did
wash
us
off
it
take
travel
to
reach
a
good
and
i
do
promise
that
we
making
slow
time
if
it
rains
let
it
rain
the
pack
outfit
is
well
covered
we
will
have
to
get
surely
replied
madeline
and
she
smiled
at
his
inference
she
knew
what
a
storm
was
in
that
country
and
her
guests
had
yet
to
experience
one
if
it
rains
let
it
stewart
rode
on
and
madeline
followed
up
the
slope
toiled
and
nodded
the
the
little
burros
going
easily
where
the
horses
labored
their
packs
like
the
humps
of
camels
bobbed
from
side
to
side
stones
rattled
down
the
wavered
black
the
dust
puffed
up
and
sailed
the
sky
was
a
pale
blue
like
heated
steel
except
where
dark
clouds
peeped
over
the
mountain
crests
a
heavy
sultry
atmosphere
made
breathing
difficult
down
the
slope
the
trailing
party
stretched
out
in
twos
and
threes
and
it
was
easy
to
distinguish
the
weary
riders
half
a
mile
farther
up
madeline
could
see
over
the
foothills
to
the
north
and
west
and
a
little
south
and
she
forgot
the
heat
and
weariness
and
discomfort
for
her
guests
in
wide
unlimited
prospects
of
earth
she
marked
the
gray
valley
and
the
black
mountains
and
the
wide
red
gateway
of
the
desert
and
the
dim
shadowy
peaks
blue
as
the
sky
they
pierced
she
was
sorry
when
the
bleak
gnarled
shut
off
her
view
then
there
came
a
respite
from
the
steep
climb
and
the
way
led
in
a
winding
course
through
a
matted
forest
of
stunted
trees
even
up
to
this
elevation
the
desert
reached
with
its
gaunt
hand
the
clouds
overspreading
the
sky
hiding
the
sun
made
a
welcome
change
the
rested
and
stewart
and
madeline
waited
for
the
party
to
come
up
here
he
briefly
explained
to
her
that
don
carlos
and
his
bandits
had
left
the
ranch
some
time
in
the
night
thunder
rumbled
in
the
distance
and
a
faint
wind
rustled
the
scant
foliage
of
the
cedars
the
air
grew
oppressive
the
horses
panted
sure
it
be
a
hummer
said
stewart
the
first
storm
almost
always
is
bad
i
can
feel
it
in
the
the
air
indeed
seemed
to
be
charged
with
a
heavy
force
that
was
waiting
to
be
liberated
one
by
one
the
couples
mounted
to
the
cedar
forest
and
the
feminine
contingent
declaimed
eloquently
for
rest
but
there
was
to
be
no
permanent
rest
until
night
and
then
that
depended
upon
reaching
the
crags
the
wagged
onward
and
stewart
fell
in
behind
the
gathered
slowly
around
the
peaks
low
rumble
and
howl
of
thunder
increased
in
frequence
slowly
the
light
shaded
as
smoky
clouds
rolled
up
the
air
grew
sultrier
and
the
exasperating
breeze
puffed
a
few
times
and
then
failed
an
hour
later
the
party
had
climbed
high
and
was
rounding
the
side
of
a
great
bare
ridge
that
long
had
hidden
the
crags
the
last
burro
of
the
plodded
over
the
ridge
out
of
madeline
sight
she
looked
backward
down
the
slope
amused
to
see
her
guests
change
wearily
from
side
to
side
in
their
saddles
far
below
lay
the
cedar
flat
and
the
foothills
far
to
the
west
the
sky
was
still
clear
with
shafts
of
sunlight
shooting
down
from
behind
the
encroaching
clouds
stewart
reached
the
summit
of
the
ridge
and
though
only
a
few
rods
ahead
he
waved
to
her
sweeping
his
hand
round
to
what
he
saw
beyond
it
was
an
impressive
gesture
and
madeline
never
having
climbed
as
high
as
this
anticipated
much
majesty
surmounted
the
last
few
steps
and
snorting
halted
beside
stewart
black
to
madeline
the
scene
was
as
if
the
world
had
changed
the
ridge
was
a
it
dropped
before
her
into
a
black
gulf
eastward
beyond
the
gulf
round
bare
loomed
up
upward
on
the
right
led
giant
steps
of
cliff
and
bench
and
weathered
slope
to
the
and
crags
standing
dark
and
bare
against
the
stormy
sky
massed
inky
clouds
were
piling
across
the
peaks
obscuring
the
highest
ones
a
fork
of
white
lightning
flashed
and
like
the
booming
of
an
avalanche
thunder
followed
that
bold
world
of
broken
rock
under
the
slow
mustering
of
was
a
grim
spectacle
it
had
beauty
but
beauty
of
the
sublime
and
majestic
kind
the
fierce
desert
had
reached
up
to
meet
the
magnetic
heights
where
heat
and
wind
and
frost
and
lightning
and
flood
contended
in
everlasting
strife
and
before
their
onslaught
this
mighty
upflung
world
of
rugged
stone
was
crumbling
splitting
wearing
to
ruin
madeline
glanced
at
stewart
he
had
forgotten
her
presence
immovable
as
stone
he
sat
his
horse
and
like
an
indian
unconscious
of
thought
he
watched
and
watched
to
see
him
thus
to
divine
the
strange
affinity
between
the
soul
of
this
man
become
primitive
and
the
savage
environment
that
had
developed
him
were
powerful
helps
to
madeline
hammond
in
her
strange
desire
to
understand
his
nature
a
cracking
of
hoofs
behind
her
broke
the
spell
monty
had
reached
the
summit
gene
what
it
wo
all
be
doin
in
a
minnut
moses
hisself
tell
observed
monty
then
dorothy
climbed
to
his
side
and
looked
oh
is
it
just
perfectly
lovely
she
exclaimed
but
i
wish
it
would
storm
we
all
get
once
more
stewart
faced
the
ascent
keeping
to
the
slow
heave
of
the
ridge
as
it
rose
southward
toward
the
looming
spires
of
rock
soon
he
was
off
smooth
ground
and
madeline
some
rods
behind
him
looked
back
with
concern
at
her
friends
here
the
real
toil
the
real
climb
began
and
a
mountain
storm
was
about
to
burst
in
all
its
fury
the
slope
that
stewart
entered
upon
was
a
magnificent
monument
to
the
ruined
crags
above
it
was
a
southerly
slope
and
therefore
covered
with
cercocarpus
and
yucca
and
some
shrub
that
madeline
believed
was
manzanita
every
foot
of
the
trail
seemed
to
slide
under
majesty
what
hard
ground
there
was
could
not
be
traveled
upon
owing
to
the
spiny
covering
or
masses
of
shattered
rocks
gullies
lined
the
slope
then
the
sky
grew
blacker
the
clouds
appeared
to
be
suddenly
agitated
they
piled
and
rolled
and
mushroomed
and
obscured
the
crags
the
air
moved
heavily
and
seemed
to
be
laden
with
sulphurous
smoke
and
sharp
lightning
flashes
began
to
play
a
distant
roar
of
wind
could
be
heard
between
the
peals
of
thunder
stewart
waited
for
madeline
under
the
lee
of
a
shelving
cliff
where
the
cowboys
had
halted
the
majesty
was
sensitive
to
the
flashes
of
lightning
madeline
patted
his
neck
and
softly
called
to
him
the
weary
burros
nodded
the
mexican
women
covered
their
heads
with
their
mantles
stewart
untied
the
slicker
at
the
back
of
madeline
saddle
and
helped
her
on
with
it
then
he
put
on
his
own
the
other
cowboys
followed
suit
presently
madeline
saw
monty
and
dorothy
rounding
the
cliff
and
hoped
the
others
would
come
soon
a
knotted
rope
of
lightning
burned
down
out
of
the
clouds
and
instantly
a
crashed
seeming
to
shake
the
foundations
of
the
earth
then
it
rolled
as
if
banging
from
cloud
to
cloud
and
boomed
along
the
peaks
and
reverberated
from
deep
to
low
at
last
to
rumble
away
into
silence
madeline
felt
the
electricity
in
mane
and
it
seemed
to
tingle
through
her
nerves
the
air
had
a
weird
bright
cast
the
ponderous
clouds
swallowed
more
and
more
of
the
eastern
domes
this
moment
of
the
breaking
of
the
storm
with
the
strange
growing
roar
of
wind
like
a
moaning
monster
was
pregnant
with
a
emotion
for
madeline
hammond
glorious
it
was
to
be
free
healthy
out
in
the
open
under
the
shadow
of
the
mountain
and
cloud
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
and
rain
and
storm
another
dazzling
blue
blaze
showed
the
bold
and
the
clouds
in
the
flare
of
light
madeline
saw
stewart
face
are
you
afraid
she
asked
yes
he
replied
simply
then
the
thunderbolt
racked
the
heavens
and
as
it
boomed
away
in
lessening
power
madeline
reflected
with
surprise
upon
stewart
answer
something
in
his
face
had
made
her
ask
him
what
she
considered
a
foolish
question
his
reply
amazed
her
she
loved
a
storm
why
should
he
fear
it
he
with
whom
she
could
not
associate
fear
how
strange
have
you
not
been
out
in
many
storms
a
smile
that
was
only
a
gleam
flitted
over
his
dark
face
in
hundreds
of
them
by
day
with
the
cattle
stampeding
at
night
alone
on
the
mountain
with
the
pines
crashing
and
the
rocks
rolling
in
flood
on
the
it
not
only
the
lightning
then
she
asked
no
all
the
madeline
felt
that
henceforth
she
would
have
less
faith
in
what
she
had
imagined
was
her
love
of
the
elements
what
little
she
knew
if
this
man
feared
a
storm
then
there
was
something
about
a
storm
to
fear
and
suddenly
as
the
ground
quaked
under
her
horse
feet
and
all
the
sky
grew
black
and
crisscrossed
by
flaming
streaks
and
between
thunderous
reports
there
was
a
strange
hollow
roar
sweeping
down
upon
her
she
realized
how
small
was
her
knowledge
and
experience
of
the
mighty
forces
of
nature
then
with
that
perversity
of
character
of
which
she
was
wholly
conscious
she
was
humble
submissive
reverent
and
fearful
even
while
she
gloried
in
the
grandeur
of
the
dark
crags
and
canyons
the
stupendous
strife
of
sound
the
wonderful
driving
lances
of
white
fire
with
blacker
gloom
and
deafening
roar
came
the
torrent
of
rain
it
was
a
it
was
like
solid
water
tumbling
down
for
long
madeline
sat
her
horse
head
bent
to
the
pelting
rain
when
its
force
lessened
and
she
heard
stewart
call
for
all
to
follow
she
looked
up
to
see
that
he
was
starting
once
more
she
shot
a
glimpse
at
dorothy
and
as
quickly
glanced
away
dorothy
who
would
not
wear
a
hat
suitable
for
inclement
weather
nor
one
of
the
horrid
yellow
sticky
slickers
was
a
drenched
and
disheveled
spectacle
madeline
did
not
trust
herself
to
look
at
the
other
girls
it
was
enough
to
hear
their
lament
so
she
turned
her
horse
into
stewart
trail
rain
fell
steadily
the
fury
of
the
storm
however
had
passed
and
the
roll
of
thunder
diminished
in
volume
the
air
had
wonderfully
cleared
and
was
growing
cool
madeline
began
to
feel
uncomfortably
cold
and
wet
stewart
was
climbing
faster
than
formerly
and
she
noted
that
monty
kept
at
her
heels
pressing
her
on
time
had
been
lost
and
the
was
a
long
way
off
the
began
to
lag
and
get
footsore
the
sharp
rocks
of
the
trail
were
cruel
to
their
feet
then
as
madeline
began
to
tire
she
noticed
less
and
less
around
her
the
ascent
grew
rougher
and
steeper
slow
toil
for
panting
horses
the
thinning
rain
grew
colder
and
sometimes
a
stronger
whip
of
wind
lashed
stingingly
in
face
her
horse
climbed
and
climbed
and
brush
and
sharp
corners
of
stone
everlastingly
pulled
and
tore
at
her
wet
garments
a
gray
gloom
settled
down
around
her
night
was
approaching
majesty
heaved
upward
with
a
snort
the
wet
saddle
creaked
and
an
even
motion
told
madeline
she
was
on
level
ground
she
looked
up
to
see
looming
crags
and
spires
like
huge
dark
at
the
base
and
growing
light
upward
the
rain
had
ceased
but
the
branches
of
and
juniper
were
arms
reaching
out
for
her
through
an
opening
between
crags
madeline
caught
a
momentary
glimpse
of
the
west
red
shone
through
the
murky
broken
clouds
the
sun
had
set
stewart
horse
was
on
a
now
and
madeline
left
the
trail
more
to
majesty
than
to
her
own
choosing
the
shadows
deepened
and
the
crags
grew
gloomy
and
spectral
a
cool
wind
moaned
through
the
dark
trees
coyotes
scenting
the
hounds
kept
apace
of
them
and
barked
and
howled
off
in
the
gloom
but
the
tired
hounds
did
not
appear
to
notice
as
black
night
began
to
envelop
her
surroundings
madeline
marked
that
the
had
given
place
to
pine
forest
suddenly
a
of
light
pierced
the
ebony
blackness
like
a
solitary
star
in
dark
sky
it
twinkled
and
blinked
she
lost
sight
of
it
found
it
again
it
grew
larger
black
crossed
her
line
of
vision
the
light
was
a
fire
she
heard
a
cowboy
song
and
the
wild
chorus
of
a
pack
of
coyotes
drops
of
rain
on
the
branches
of
trees
glittered
in
the
rays
of
the
fire
stewart
tall
figure
with
sombrero
slouched
down
was
now
and
then
outlined
against
a
growing
circle
of
light
and
by
the
aid
of
that
light
she
saw
him
turn
every
moment
or
so
to
look
back
probably
to
assure
himself
that
she
was
close
behind
with
a
prospect
of
fire
and
warmth
and
food
and
rest
enthusiasm
revived
what
a
climb
there
was
promise
in
this
wild
ride
and
lonely
trail
and
hidden
craggy
height
not
only
in
the
adventure
her
friends
yearned
for
but
in
some
nameless
joy
and
spirit
for
herself
xvi
the
crags
glad
indeed
was
madeline
to
be
lifted
off
her
horse
beside
a
roaring
fire
to
see
steaming
pots
upon
coals
except
about
her
shoulders
which
had
been
protected
by
the
slicker
she
was
wringing
wet
the
mexican
women
came
quickly
to
help
her
change
in
a
tent
near
by
but
madeline
preferred
for
the
moment
to
warm
her
numb
feet
and
hands
and
to
watch
the
spectacle
of
her
arriving
friends
dorothy
plumped
off
her
saddle
into
the
arms
of
several
waiting
cowboys
she
could
scarcely
walk
far
removed
in
appearance
was
she
from
her
usual
stylish
self
her
face
was
hidden
by
a
limp
and
lopsided
hat
from
under
the
disheveled
brim
came
a
plaintive
moan
what
ride
beck
was
in
worse
condition
she
had
to
be
taken
off
her
horse
i
paralyzed
i
a
wreck
bobby
get
a
bobby
was
solicitous
and
willing
but
there
were
no
florence
dismounted
easily
and
but
for
her
mass
of
hair
wet
and
tumbling
would
have
been
taken
for
a
handsome
cowboy
edith
wayne
had
stood
the
physical
strain
of
the
ride
better
than
dorothy
however
as
her
mount
was
rather
small
she
had
been
more
at
the
mercy
of
cactus
and
brush
her
habit
hung
in
tatters
helen
had
preserved
a
remnant
of
style
as
well
as
of
pride
and
perhaps
a
little
strength
but
her
face
was
white
her
eyes
were
big
and
she
limped
majesty
she
exclaimed
what
did
you
want
to
do
to
us
kill
us
outright
or
make
us
homesick
of
all
of
them
however
ambrose
wife
christine
the
little
french
maid
had
suffered
the
most
in
that
long
ride
she
was
unaccustomed
to
horses
ambrose
had
to
carry
her
into
the
big
tent
florence
persuaded
madeline
to
leave
the
fire
and
when
they
went
in
with
the
others
dorothy
was
wailing
because
her
wet
boots
would
not
come
off
beck
was
weeping
and
trying
to
direct
a
mexican
woman
to
unfasten
her
bedraggled
dress
and
there
was
general
pandemonium
warm
clothes
hot
drinks
and
grub
warm
blankets
rang
out
sharp
order
then
with
florence
helping
the
mexican
women
it
was
not
long
until
madeline
and
the
feminine
side
of
the
party
were
comfortable
except
for
the
weariness
and
aches
that
only
rest
and
sleep
could
alleviate
neither
fatigue
nor
pains
however
nor
the
strangeness
of
being
packed
under
canvas
nor
the
howls
of
coyotes
kept
guests
from
stretching
out
with
long
grateful
sighs
and
one
by
one
dropping
into
deep
slumber
madeline
whispered
a
little
to
florence
and
laughed
with
her
once
or
twice
and
then
the
light
flickering
on
the
canvas
faded
and
her
eyelids
closed
darkness
and
roar
of
camp
life
low
voices
of
men
thump
of
horses
hoofs
coyote
serenade
the
sense
of
warmth
and
sweet
rest
all
drifted
away
when
she
awakened
shadows
of
swaying
branches
moved
on
the
sunlit
canvas
above
her
she
heard
the
ringing
strokes
of
an
ax
but
no
other
sound
from
outside
slow
regular
breathing
attested
to
the
deep
slumbers
of
her
tent
comrades
she
observed
presently
that
florence
was
missing
from
the
number
madeline
rose
and
peeped
out
between
the
flaps
an
exquisitely
beautiful
scene
surprised
and
enthralled
her
gaze
she
saw
a
level
space
green
with
long
grass
bright
with
flowers
dotted
with
groves
of
graceful
firs
and
pines
and
spruces
reaching
to
superb
crags
rosy
and
golden
in
the
sunlight
eager
to
get
out
where
she
could
enjoy
an
unrestricted
view
she
searched
for
her
pack
found
it
in
a
corner
and
then
hurriedly
and
quietly
dressed
her
favorite
russ
and
tartar
were
asleep
before
the
door
where
they
had
been
chained
she
awakened
them
and
loosened
them
thinking
the
while
that
it
must
have
been
stewart
who
had
chained
them
near
her
close
at
hand
also
was
a
cowboy
bed
rolled
up
in
a
tarpaulin
the
cool
air
fragrant
with
pine
and
spruce
and
some
subtle
nameless
tang
sweet
and
tonic
made
madeline
stand
erect
and
breathe
slowly
and
deeply
it
was
like
drinking
of
a
magic
draught
she
felt
it
in
her
blood
that
it
quickened
its
flow
turning
to
look
in
the
other
direction
beyond
the
tent
she
saw
the
remnants
of
last
temporary
camp
and
farther
on
a
grove
of
beautiful
pines
from
which
came
the
sharp
ring
of
the
ax
wider
gaze
took
in
a
wonderful
park
not
only
surrounded
by
lofty
crags
but
full
of
crags
of
lesser
height
many
lifting
their
heads
from
groves
of
trees
the
morning
sun
not
yet
above
the
eastern
elevations
sent
its
rosy
and
golden
shafts
in
between
the
towering
rocks
to
tip
the
pines
madeline
with
the
hounds
beside
her
walked
through
the
nearest
grove
the
ground
was
soft
and
springy
and
brown
with
then
she
saw
that
a
clump
of
trees
had
prevented
her
from
seeing
the
most
striking
part
of
this
natural
park
the
cowboys
had
selected
a
campsite
where
they
would
have
the
morning
sun
and
afternoon
shade
several
tents
and
flies
were
already
up
there
was
a
huge
made
of
spruce
boughs
cowboys
were
busy
round
several
piles
of
packs
lay
covered
with
tarpaulins
and
beds
were
rolled
up
under
the
trees
this
space
was
a
kind
of
rolling
meadow
with
isolated
trees
here
and
there
and
other
trees
in
aisles
and
circles
and
it
mounted
up
in
low
grassy
banks
to
great
towers
of
stone
five
hundred
feet
high
other
crags
rose
behind
these
from
under
a
mossy
cliff
huge
and
green
and
cool
bubbled
a
full
clear
spring
wild
flowers
fringed
its
banks
out
in
the
meadow
the
horses
were
in
grass
that
waved
in
the
morning
breeze
florence
espied
madeline
under
the
trees
and
came
running
she
was
like
a
young
girl
with
life
and
color
and
joy
she
wore
a
flannel
blouse
corduroy
skirt
and
moccasins
and
her
hair
was
fastened
under
a
band
like
an
indian
castleton
gone
with
a
gun
for
hours
it
seems
said
florence
gene
just
went
to
hunt
him
up
the
other
gentlemen
are
still
asleep
i
imagine
they
sure
will
sleep
up
heah
in
this
then
florence
fell
to
questioning
madeline
about
details
of
camp
arrangement
which
stewart
and
florence
herself
could
hardly
see
to
without
suggestion
before
any
of
madeline
sleepy
guests
awakened
the
camp
was
completed
madeline
and
florence
had
a
tent
under
a
but
they
did
not
intend
to
sleep
in
it
except
during
stormy
weather
they
spread
a
tarpaulin
made
their
bed
on
it
and
elected
to
sleep
under
the
light
of
the
stars
after
that
taking
the
hounds
with
them
they
explored
to
madeline
surprise
the
park
was
not
a
little
nook
nestling
among
the
crags
but
extended
farther
than
they
cared
to
walk
and
was
rather
a
series
of
parks
they
were
no
more
than
small
valleys
between
peaks
as
the
day
advanced
the
charm
of
the
place
grew
upon
madeline
even
at
noon
with
the
sun
beating
down
there
was
comfortable
warmth
rather
than
heat
it
was
the
kind
of
warmth
that
madeline
liked
to
feel
in
the
spring
and
the
sweet
thin
rare
atmosphere
began
to
affect
her
strangely
she
breathed
deeply
of
it
until
she
felt
as
if
her
body
lacked
substance
and
might
drift
away
like
a
thistledown
all
at
once
she
grew
uncomfortably
sleepy
a
dreamy
languor
possessed
her
and
lying
under
a
pine
with
her
head
against
florence
she
went
to
sleep
when
she
opened
her
eyes
the
shadows
of
the
crags
stretched
from
the
west
and
between
them
streamed
a
light
it
was
hazy
smoky
sunshine
losing
its
fire
the
afternoon
had
far
advanced
madeline
sat
up
florence
was
lazily
reading
the
two
mexican
women
were
at
work
under
the
fly
where
the
big
stone
fireplace
had
been
erected
no
one
else
was
in
sight
florence
upon
being
questioned
informed
madeline
that
incident
about
camp
had
been
delightfully
absent
castleton
had
returned
and
was
profoundly
sleeping
with
the
other
men
presently
a
chorus
of
merry
calls
attracted
madeline
attention
and
she
turned
to
see
helen
limping
along
with
dorothy
and
beck
and
edith
supporting
each
other
they
were
all
rested
but
lame
and
delighted
with
the
place
and
as
hungry
as
bears
awakened
from
a
winter
sleep
madeline
forthwith
escorted
them
round
the
camp
and
through
the
many
aisles
between
the
trees
and
to
the
mossy
nooks
under
the
crags
then
they
had
dinner
sitting
on
the
ground
after
the
manner
of
indians
and
it
was
a
dinner
that
lacked
merriment
only
because
everybody
was
too
busily
appeasing
appetite
later
stewart
led
them
across
a
neck
of
the
park
up
a
rather
steep
climb
between
towering
crags
to
take
them
out
upon
a
grassy
promontory
that
faced
the
great
open
west
a
vast
ridged
streaked
and
reddened
sweep
of
earth
rolling
down
as
it
seemed
to
the
golden
sunset
end
of
the
world
castleton
said
it
was
a
jolly
fine
view
dorothy
voiced
her
usual
languid
enthusiasm
helen
was
on
fire
with
pleasure
and
wonder
beck
appealed
to
bobby
to
see
how
he
liked
it
before
she
ventured
and
she
then
reiterated
his
praise
and
edith
wayne
like
madeline
and
florence
was
silent
boyd
was
politely
interested
he
was
the
kind
of
man
who
appeared
to
care
for
things
as
other
people
cared
for
them
madeline
watched
the
slow
transformation
of
the
changing
west
with
its
haze
of
desert
dust
through
which
mountain
and
cloud
and
sun
slowly
darkened
she
watched
until
her
eyes
ached
and
scarcely
had
a
thought
of
what
she
was
watching
when
her
eyes
shifted
to
encounter
the
tall
form
of
stewart
standing
motionless
on
the
rim
her
mind
became
active
again
as
usual
he
stood
apart
from
the
others
and
now
he
seemed
aloof
and
unconscious
he
made
a
dark
powerful
figure
and
he
fitted
that
wild
promontory
she
experienced
a
strange
annoying
surprise
when
she
discovered
both
helen
and
dorothy
watching
stewart
with
peculiar
interest
edith
too
was
alive
to
the
splendid
picture
the
cowboy
made
but
when
edith
smiled
and
whispered
in
her
ear
it
so
good
to
look
at
a
man
like
that
madeline
again
felt
the
surprise
only
this
time
the
accompaniment
was
a
vague
pleasure
rather
than
annoyance
helen
and
dorothy
were
flirts
one
deliberate
and
skilled
the
other
unconscious
and
natural
edith
wayne
occasionally
and
madeline
reflected
that
the
occasions
were
infrequent
admired
a
man
sincerely
just
here
madeline
might
have
fallen
into
a
somewhat
revealing
state
of
mind
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fact
that
she
believed
stewart
was
only
an
object
of
deep
interest
to
her
not
as
a
man
but
as
a
part
of
this
wild
and
wonderful
west
which
was
claiming
her
so
she
did
not
inquire
of
herself
why
coquetry
and
dorothy
languishing
allurement
annoyed
her
or
why
edith
eloquent
smile
and
words
had
pleased
her
she
got
as
far
however
as
to
think
scornfully
how
helen
and
dorothy
would
welcome
and
meet
a
flirtation
with
this
cowboy
and
then
go
back
home
and
forget
him
as
utterly
as
if
he
had
never
existed
she
wondered
too
with
a
curious
twist
of
feeling
that
was
almost
eagerness
how
the
cowboy
would
meet
their
advances
obviously
the
situation
was
unfair
to
him
and
if
by
some
strange
accident
he
escaped
unscathed
by
dorothy
beautiful
eyes
he
would
never
be
able
to
withstand
helen
subtle
and
fascinating
and
imperious
personality
they
returned
to
camp
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
and
made
merry
round
a
blazing
but
madeline
guests
soon
succumbed
to
the
persistent
and
irresistible
desire
to
sleep
then
madeline
went
to
bed
with
florence
under
the
russ
lay
upon
one
side
and
tartar
upon
the
other
the
cool
night
breeze
swept
over
her
fanning
her
face
waving
her
hair
it
was
not
strong
enough
to
make
any
sound
through
the
branches
but
it
stirred
a
faint
silken
rustle
in
the
long
grass
the
coyotes
began
their
weird
bark
and
howl
russ
raised
his
head
to
growl
at
their
impudence
madeline
faced
upward
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
under
those
wonderful
white
stars
she
would
never
be
able
to
go
to
sleep
they
blinked
down
through
the
delicate
crisscross
of
pine
foliage
and
they
looked
so
big
and
so
close
then
she
gazed
away
to
open
space
where
an
expanse
of
sky
glittered
with
stars
and
the
longer
she
gazed
the
larger
they
grew
and
the
more
she
saw
it
was
her
belief
that
she
had
come
to
love
all
the
physical
things
from
which
sensations
of
beauty
and
mystery
and
strength
poured
into
her
responsive
mind
but
best
of
all
she
loved
these
western
stars
for
they
were
to
have
something
to
do
with
her
life
were
somehow
to
influence
her
destiny
for
a
few
days
the
prevailing
features
of
camp
life
for
guests
were
sleep
and
rest
dorothy
coombs
slept
through
hours
and
then
was
so
difficult
to
awaken
that
for
a
while
her
friends
were
alarmed
helen
almost
fell
asleep
while
eating
and
talking
the
men
were
more
visibly
affected
by
the
mountain
air
than
the
women
castleton
however
would
not
succumb
to
the
strange
drowsiness
while
he
had
a
chance
to
prowl
around
with
a
gun
this
languorous
spell
disappeared
presently
and
then
the
days
were
full
of
life
and
action
beck
and
bobby
and
boyd
however
did
not
go
in
for
anything
very
strenuous
edith
wayne
too
preferred
to
walk
through
the
groves
or
sit
upon
the
grassy
promontory
it
was
helen
and
dorothy
who
wanted
to
explore
the
crags
and
canyons
and
when
they
could
not
get
the
others
to
accompany
them
they
went
alone
giving
the
cowboy
guides
many
a
long
climb
necessarily
of
course
madeline
and
her
guests
were
now
thrown
much
in
company
with
the
cowboys
and
the
party
grew
to
be
like
one
big
family
her
friends
not
only
adapted
themselves
admirably
to
the
situation
but
came
to
revel
in
it
as
for
madeline
she
saw
that
outside
of
a
certain
proclivity
of
the
cowboys
to
be
gallant
and
on
and
alive
to
possibilities
of
fun
and
excitement
they
were
not
greatly
different
from
what
they
were
at
all
times
if
there
were
a
leveling
process
here
it
was
made
by
her
friends
coming
down
to
meet
the
westerners
besides
any
class
of
people
would
tend
to
grow
natural
in
such
circumstances
and
environment
madeline
found
the
situation
one
of
keen
and
double
interest
for
her
if
before
she
had
cared
to
study
her
cowboys
particularly
stewart
now
with
the
contrasts
afforded
by
her
guests
she
felt
by
turns
she
was
amused
and
mystified
and
perplexed
and
saddened
and
then
again
subtly
pleased
monty
once
he
had
overcome
his
shyness
became
a
source
of
delight
to
madeline
and
for
that
matter
to
everybody
monty
had
suddenly
discovered
that
he
was
a
success
among
the
ladies
either
he
was
exalted
to
heroic
heights
by
this
knowledge
or
he
made
it
appear
so
dorothy
had
been
his
undoing
and
in
justice
to
her
madeline
believed
her
innocent
dorothy
thought
monty
hideous
to
look
at
and
accordingly
if
he
had
been
a
hero
a
hundred
times
and
had
saved
a
hundred
poor
little
lives
he
could
not
have
interested
her
monty
followed
her
around
reminding
her
she
told
madeline
of
a
little
adoring
dog
one
moment
and
the
next
of
a
huge
devouring
gorilla
nels
and
nick
stalked
at
helen
heels
like
grenadiers
on
duty
and
if
she
as
much
as
dropped
her
glove
they
almost
came
to
blows
to
see
who
should
pick
it
up
in
a
way
castleton
was
the
best
feature
of
the
camping
party
he
was
such
an
little
man
and
his
abilities
were
at
such
tremendous
odds
with
what
might
have
been
expected
of
him
from
his
looks
he
could
ride
tramp
climb
shoot
he
liked
to
help
around
the
camp
and
the
cowboys
could
not
keep
him
from
it
he
had
an
insatiable
desire
to
do
things
that
were
new
to
him
the
cowboys
played
innumerable
tricks
upon
him
not
one
of
which
he
ever
discovered
he
was
serious
slow
in
speech
and
action
and
absolutely
imperturbable
if
imperturbability
could
ever
be
good
humor
then
he
was
always
presently
the
cowboys
began
to
understand
him
and
then
to
like
him
when
they
liked
a
man
it
meant
something
madeline
had
been
sorry
more
than
once
to
see
how
little
the
cowboys
chose
to
speak
to
boyd
harvey
with
castleton
however
they
actually
became
friends
they
did
not
know
it
and
certainly
such
a
thing
never
occurred
to
him
all
the
same
it
was
a
fact
and
it
grew
solely
out
of
the
truth
that
the
englishman
was
manly
in
the
only
way
cowboys
could
have
interpreted
manliness
when
after
innumerable
attempts
he
succeeded
in
throwing
the
on
a
the
cowboys
began
to
respect
him
castleton
needed
only
one
more
accomplishment
to
claim
their
hearts
and
he
kept
trying
that
to
ride
a
bucking
bronco
one
of
the
cowboys
had
a
bronco
that
they
called
devil
every
day
for
a
week
devil
threw
the
englishman
all
over
the
park
ruined
his
clothes
bruised
him
and
finally
kicked
him
then
the
cowboys
solicitously
tried
to
make
castleton
give
up
and
this
was
remarkable
enough
for
the
spectacle
of
an
english
lord
on
a
bucking
bronco
was
one
that
any
westerner
would
have
ridden
a
thousand
miles
to
see
whenever
devil
threw
castleton
the
cowboys
went
into
spasms
but
castleton
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
fail
and
there
came
a
day
when
devil
could
not
throw
him
then
it
was
a
singular
sight
to
see
the
men
line
up
to
shake
hands
with
the
cool
englishman
even
stewart
who
had
watched
from
the
background
came
forward
with
a
warm
and
pleasant
smile
on
his
dark
face
when
castleton
went
to
his
tent
there
was
much
characteristic
cowboy
talk
and
this
time
vastly
different
from
the
former
persiflage
by
gawd
ejaculated
monty
price
who
seemed
to
be
the
most
amazed
and
elated
of
them
all
thet
the
fust
englishman
i
ever
seen
he
orful
deceivin
to
look
at
but
i
know
now
why
england
rules
the
wurrld
jest
take
a
peek
at
thet
bronco
his
spirit
is
broke
rid
by
a
leetle
english
dook
no
bigger
a
grasshopper
fellers
if
it
hai
dawned
on
you
yit
let
monty
price
give
you
a
hunch
there
no
flies
on
castleton
an
i
bet
a
million
steers
to
a
rawhide
rope
thet
next
he
be
throwin
a
gun
as
good
as
it
was
a
distinct
pleasure
for
madeline
to
realize
that
she
liked
castleton
all
the
better
for
the
traits
brought
out
so
forcibly
by
his
association
with
the
cowboys
on
the
other
hand
she
liked
the
cowboys
better
for
something
in
them
that
contact
with
easterners
brought
out
this
was
especially
true
in
stewart
case
she
had
been
wholly
wrong
when
she
had
imagined
he
would
fall
an
easy
victim
to
dorothy
eyes
and
helen
lures
he
was
kind
helpful
courteous
and
watchful
but
he
had
no
sentiment
he
did
not
see
dorothy
charms
or
feel
fascination
and
their
efforts
to
captivate
him
were
now
so
obvious
that
beck
taunted
them
and
edith
smiled
knowingly
and
bobby
and
boyd
made
playful
remarks
all
of
which
cut
helen
pride
and
hurt
vanity
they
essayed
open
conquest
of
stewart
so
it
came
about
that
madeline
unconsciously
admitted
the
cowboy
to
a
place
in
her
mind
never
occupied
by
any
other
the
instant
it
occurred
to
her
why
he
was
proof
against
the
wiles
of
the
other
women
she
drove
that
amazing
and
strangely
disturbing
thought
from
her
nevertheless
as
she
was
human
she
could
not
help
thinking
and
being
pleased
and
enjoying
a
little
the
discomfiture
of
the
two
coquettes
moreover
from
this
thought
of
stewart
and
the
watchfulness
growing
out
of
it
she
discovered
more
about
him
he
was
not
happy
he
often
paced
up
and
down
the
grove
at
night
he
absented
himself
from
camp
sometimes
during
the
afternoon
when
nels
and
nick
and
monty
were
there
he
was
always
watching
the
trails
as
if
he
expected
to
see
some
one
come
riding
up
he
alone
of
the
cowboys
did
not
indulge
in
the
fun
and
talk
around
the
he
remained
preoccupied
and
sad
and
was
always
looking
away
into
distance
madeline
had
a
strange
sense
of
his
guardianship
over
her
and
remembering
don
carlos
she
imagined
he
worried
a
good
deal
over
his
charge
and
indeed
over
the
safety
of
all
the
party
but
if
he
did
worry
about
possible
visits
from
wandering
guerrillas
why
did
he
absent
himself
from
camp
suddenly
into
madeline
inquisitive
mind
flashed
a
remembrance
of
the
mexican
girl
bonita
who
had
never
been
heard
of
since
that
night
she
rode
stewart
big
horse
out
of
el
cajon
the
remembrance
of
her
brought
an
idea
perhaps
stewart
had
a
rendezvous
in
the
mountains
and
these
lonely
trips
of
his
were
to
meet
bonita
with
the
idea
hot
blood
flamed
into
madeline
cheek
then
she
was
amazed
at
her
own
feelings
amazed
because
her
swiftest
succeeding
thought
was
to
deny
the
idea
amazed
that
its
conception
had
fired
her
cheek
with
shame
then
her
old
self
the
one
aloof
from
this
new
self
gained
control
over
her
emotions
but
madeline
found
that
self
a
creature
of
strange
power
to
return
and
govern
at
any
moment
she
found
it
fighting
loyally
for
what
intelligence
and
wisdom
told
her
was
only
her
romantic
conception
of
a
cowboy
she
reasoned
if
stewart
were
the
kind
of
man
her
feminine
skepticism
wanted
to
make
him
he
would
not
have
been
so
blind
to
the
coquettish
advances
of
helen
and
dorothy
he
had
once
been
she
did
not
want
to
recall
what
he
had
once
been
but
he
had
been
uplifted
madeline
hammond
declared
that
she
was
swayed
by
a
strong
beating
pride
and
her
instinctive
woman
faith
told
her
that
he
could
not
stoop
to
such
dishonor
she
reproached
herself
for
having
momentarily
thought
of
it
one
afternoon
a
huge
swooped
out
of
the
sky
and
enveloped
the
crags
it
obscured
the
westering
sun
and
laid
a
mantle
of
darkness
over
the
park
madeline
was
uneasy
because
several
of
her
party
including
helen
and
dorothy
had
ridden
off
with
the
cowboys
that
afternoon
and
had
not
returned
florence
assured
her
that
even
if
they
did
not
get
back
before
the
storm
broke
there
was
no
reason
for
apprehension
nevertheless
madeline
sent
for
stewart
and
asked
him
to
go
or
send
some
one
in
search
of
them
perhaps
half
an
hour
later
madeline
heard
the
welcome
pattering
of
hoofs
on
the
trail
the
big
tent
was
brightly
lighted
by
several
lanterns
edith
and
florence
were
with
her
it
was
so
black
outside
that
madeline
could
not
see
a
rod
before
her
face
the
wind
was
moaning
in
the
trees
and
big
drops
of
rain
were
pelting
upon
the
canvas
presently
just
outside
the
door
the
horses
halted
and
there
was
a
sharp
bustle
of
sound
such
as
would
naturally
result
from
a
hurried
dismounting
and
confusion
in
the
dark
beck
came
running
into
the
tent
out
of
breath
and
radiant
because
they
had
beaten
the
storm
helen
entered
next
and
a
little
later
came
dorothy
but
long
enough
to
make
her
entrance
more
noticeable
the
instant
madeline
saw
dorothy
blazing
eyes
she
knew
something
unusual
had
happened
whatever
it
was
might
have
escaped
comment
had
not
helen
caught
sight
of
dorothy
heavens
dot
but
you
handsome
occasionally
remarked
helen
when
you
get
some
life
in
your
face
and
eyes
dorothy
turned
her
face
away
from
the
others
and
perhaps
it
was
only
accident
that
she
looked
into
a
mirror
hanging
on
the
tent
wall
swiftly
she
put
her
hand
up
to
feel
a
wide
red
welt
on
her
cheek
dorothy
had
been
assiduously
careful
of
her
soft
white
skin
and
here
was
an
ugly
mark
marring
its
beauty
look
at
that
she
cried
in
distress
my
complexion
ruined
how
did
you
get
such
a
splotch
inquired
helen
going
closer
i
been
kissed
exclaimed
dorothy
dramatically
what
queried
helen
more
curiously
while
the
others
laughed
i
been
kissed
hugged
and
kissed
by
one
of
those
shameless
cowboys
it
was
so
outside
i
could
see
a
thing
and
so
noisy
i
could
hear
but
somebody
was
trying
to
help
me
off
my
horse
my
foot
caught
in
the
stirrup
and
away
i
went
right
into
somebody
arms
then
he
did
it
the
wretch
he
hugged
and
kissed
me
in
a
most
awful
bearish
manner
i
could
budge
a
finger
i
simply
boiling
with
rage
when
the
outburst
of
mirth
subsided
dorothy
turned
her
big
dilated
eyes
upon
florence
do
these
cowboys
really
take
advantage
of
a
girl
when
she
helpless
and
in
the
dark
of
course
they
do
replied
florence
with
her
frank
smile
dot
what
in
the
world
could
you
expect
asked
helen
have
you
been
dying
to
be
kissed
well
you
acted
like
it
then
i
never
before
saw
you
in
a
rage
over
being
i
i
would
care
so
much
if
the
brute
had
scoured
the
skin
off
my
face
he
had
whiskers
as
sharp
and
stiff
as
sandpaper
and
when
i
jerked
away
he
rubbed
my
cheek
with
this
revelation
as
to
the
cause
of
her
outraged
dignity
almost
prostrated
her
friends
with
glee
dot
i
agree
with
you
it
one
thing
to
be
kissed
and
quite
another
to
have
your
beauty
spoiled
replied
helen
presently
who
was
this
particular
savage
i
do
know
burst
out
dorothy
if
i
did
i
i
her
eyes
expressed
the
direful
punishment
she
could
not
speak
honestly
now
dot
have
you
the
least
idea
who
did
it
questioned
helen
i
hope
i
think
it
was
stewart
replied
dorothy
ah
dot
your
hope
is
father
to
the
thought
my
dear
i
sorry
to
riddle
your
little
romance
stewart
did
not
could
not
have
been
the
offender
or
how
do
you
know
he
could
demanded
dorothy
flushing
because
he
was
at
noon
before
we
rode
out
i
remember
perfectly
how
nice
and
smooth
and
brown
his
face
oh
do
you
well
if
your
memory
for
faces
is
so
good
maybe
you
can
tell
me
which
one
of
these
cowboys
was
merely
a
matter
of
elimination
replied
helen
merrily
it
was
not
nick
it
was
not
nels
it
was
not
frankie
there
was
only
one
other
cowboy
with
us
and
he
had
a
short
stubby
growth
of
black
beard
much
like
that
cactus
we
passed
on
the
oh
i
was
afraid
of
it
moaned
dorothy
i
knew
he
was
going
to
do
it
that
horrible
little
smiling
demon
monty
price
a
favorite
of
madeline
was
a
shaded
niche
under
the
lee
of
crags
facing
the
east
here
the
outlook
was
entirely
different
from
that
on
the
western
side
it
was
not
red
and
white
and
glaring
nor
so
changeable
that
it
taxed
attention
this
eastern
view
was
one
of
the
mountains
and
valleys
where
to
be
sure
there
were
arid
patches
but
the
restful
green
of
pine
and
fir
was
there
and
the
cool
gray
of
crags
bold
and
rugged
indeed
were
these
mountain
features
yet
they
were
companionably
close
not
immeasurably
distant
and
unattainable
like
the
desert
here
in
the
shade
of
afternoon
madeline
and
edith
would
often
lounge
under
a
tree
seldom
they
talked
much
for
it
was
afternoon
and
dreamy
with
the
strange
spell
of
this
mountain
fastness
there
was
smoky
haze
in
the
valleys
a
fleecy
cloud
resting
over
the
peaks
a
sailing
eagle
in
the
blue
sky
silence
that
was
the
unbroken
silence
of
the
wild
heights
and
a
soft
wind
laden
with
incense
of
pine
one
afternoon
however
edith
appeared
prone
to
talk
seriously
majesty
i
must
go
home
soon
i
can
not
stay
out
here
forever
are
you
going
back
with
me
well
maybe
replied
madeline
thoughtfully
i
have
considered
it
i
shall
have
to
visit
home
some
time
but
this
summer
mother
and
father
are
going
to
see
here
majesty
hammond
do
you
intend
to
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
in
this
wilderness
asked
edith
bluntly
madeline
was
silent
oh
it
is
glorious
do
misunderstand
me
dear
went
on
edith
earnestly
as
she
laid
her
hand
on
madeline
this
trip
has
been
a
revelation
to
me
i
did
not
tell
you
majesty
that
i
was
ill
when
i
arrived
now
i
well
so
well
look
at
helen
too
why
she
was
a
ghost
when
we
got
here
now
she
is
brown
and
strong
and
beautiful
if
it
were
for
nothing
else
than
this
wonderful
gift
of
health
i
would
love
the
west
but
i
have
come
to
love
it
for
other
things
even
spiritual
things
majesty
i
have
been
studying
you
i
see
and
feel
what
this
life
has
made
of
you
when
i
came
i
wondered
at
your
strength
your
virility
your
serenity
your
happiness
and
i
was
stunned
i
wondered
at
the
causes
of
your
change
now
i
know
you
were
sick
of
idleness
sick
of
uselessness
if
not
of
society
sick
of
the
horrible
noises
and
smells
and
contacts
one
can
no
longer
escape
in
the
cities
i
am
sick
of
all
that
too
and
i
could
tell
you
many
women
of
our
kind
who
suffer
in
a
like
manner
you
have
done
what
many
of
us
want
to
do
but
have
not
the
courage
you
have
left
it
i
am
not
blind
to
the
splendid
difference
you
have
made
in
your
life
i
think
i
would
have
discovered
even
if
your
brother
had
not
told
me
what
good
you
have
done
to
the
mexicans
and
cattlemen
of
your
range
then
you
have
work
to
do
that
is
much
the
secret
of
your
happiness
is
it
not
tell
me
tell
me
something
of
what
it
means
to
you
work
of
course
has
much
to
do
with
any
one
happiness
replied
madeline
no
one
can
be
happy
who
has
no
work
as
regards
myself
for
the
rest
i
can
hardly
tell
you
i
have
never
tried
to
put
it
in
words
frankly
i
believe
if
i
had
not
had
money
that
i
could
not
have
found
such
contentment
here
that
is
not
in
any
sense
a
judgment
against
the
west
but
if
i
had
been
poor
i
could
not
have
bought
and
maintained
my
ranch
stillwell
tells
me
there
are
many
larger
ranches
than
mine
but
none
just
like
it
then
i
am
almost
paying
my
expenses
out
of
my
business
think
of
that
my
income
instead
of
being
wasted
is
mostly
saved
i
think
i
hope
i
am
useful
i
have
been
of
some
little
good
to
the
mexicans
eased
the
hardships
of
a
few
cowboys
for
the
rest
i
think
my
life
is
a
kind
of
dream
of
course
my
ranch
and
range
are
real
my
cowboys
are
typical
if
i
were
to
tell
you
how
i
feel
about
them
it
would
simply
be
a
story
of
how
madeline
hammond
sees
the
west
they
are
true
to
the
west
it
is
i
who
am
strange
and
what
i
feel
for
them
may
be
strange
too
edith
hold
to
your
own
but
majesty
my
impressions
have
changed
at
first
i
did
not
like
the
wind
the
dust
the
sun
the
endless
open
stretches
but
now
i
do
like
them
where
once
i
saw
only
terrible
wastes
of
barren
ground
now
i
see
beauty
and
something
noble
then
at
first
your
cowboys
struck
me
as
dirty
rough
loud
crude
savage
all
that
was
primitive
i
did
not
want
them
near
me
i
imagined
them
callous
hard
men
their
only
joy
a
carouse
with
their
kind
but
i
was
wrong
i
have
changed
the
dirt
was
only
dust
and
this
desert
dust
is
clean
they
are
still
rough
loud
crude
and
savage
in
my
eyes
but
with
a
difference
they
are
natural
men
they
are
little
children
monty
price
is
one
of
nature
noblemen
the
hard
thing
is
to
discover
it
all
his
hideous
person
all
his
actions
and
speech
are
masks
of
his
real
nature
nels
is
a
joy
a
simple
sweet
kindly
quiet
man
whom
some
woman
should
have
loved
what
would
love
have
meant
to
him
he
told
me
that
no
woman
ever
loved
him
except
his
mother
and
he
lost
her
when
he
was
ten
every
man
ought
to
be
loved
especially
such
a
man
as
nels
somehow
his
gun
record
does
not
impress
me
i
never
could
believe
he
killed
a
man
then
take
your
foreman
stewart
he
is
a
cowboy
his
work
and
life
the
same
as
the
others
but
he
has
education
and
most
of
the
graces
we
are
in
the
habit
of
saying
make
a
gentleman
stewart
is
a
strange
fellow
just
like
this
strange
country
he
a
man
majesty
and
i
admire
him
so
you
see
my
impressions
are
developing
with
my
stay
out
edith
i
am
so
glad
you
told
me
that
replied
madeline
warmly
i
like
the
country
and
i
like
the
men
went
on
edith
one
reason
i
want
to
go
home
soon
is
because
i
am
discontented
enough
at
home
now
without
falling
in
love
with
the
west
for
of
course
majesty
i
would
i
could
not
live
out
here
and
that
brings
me
to
my
point
admitting
all
the
beauty
and
charm
and
wholesomeness
and
good
of
this
wonderful
country
still
it
is
no
place
for
you
madeline
hammond
you
have
your
position
your
wealth
your
name
your
family
you
must
marry
you
must
have
children
you
must
not
give
up
all
that
for
a
quixotic
life
in
a
i
am
convinced
edith
that
i
shall
live
here
all
the
rest
of
my
oh
majesty
i
hate
to
preach
this
way
but
i
promised
your
mother
i
would
talk
to
you
and
the
truth
is
i
hate
i
hate
what
i
saying
i
envy
you
your
courage
and
wisdom
i
know
you
have
refused
to
marry
boyd
harvey
i
could
see
that
in
his
face
i
believe
you
will
refuse
castleton
whom
will
you
marry
what
chance
is
there
for
a
woman
of
your
position
to
marry
out
here
what
in
the
world
will
become
of
you
quien
sabe
replied
madeline
with
a
smile
that
was
almost
sad
not
so
many
hours
after
this
conversation
with
edith
madeline
sat
with
boyd
harvey
upon
the
grassy
promontory
overlooking
the
west
and
she
listened
once
again
to
his
suave
courtship
suddenly
she
turned
to
him
and
said
boyd
if
i
married
you
would
you
be
willing
glad
to
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
here
in
the
west
majesty
he
exclaimed
there
was
amaze
in
the
voice
usually
so
even
and
well
modulated
amaze
in
the
handsome
face
usually
so
indifferent
her
question
had
startled
him
she
saw
him
look
down
the
cliffs
over
the
barren
slopes
and
cedared
ridges
beyond
the
foothills
to
the
grim
and
ghastly
desert
just
then
with
its
red
veils
of
sunlit
its
illimitable
waste
of
ruined
and
upheaved
earth
it
was
a
sinister
spectacle
no
he
replied
with
a
tinge
of
shame
in
his
cheek
madeline
said
no
more
nor
did
he
speak
she
was
spared
the
pain
of
refusing
him
and
she
imagined
he
would
never
ask
her
again
there
was
both
relief
and
regret
in
the
conviction
humiliated
lovers
seldom
made
good
friends
it
was
impossible
not
to
like
boyd
harvey
the
thought
of
that
and
why
she
could
not
marry
him
concentrated
her
mind
upon
the
man
she
looked
at
him
and
she
thought
of
him
he
was
handsome
young
rich
well
born
pleasant
cultivated
he
was
all
that
made
a
gentleman
of
his
class
if
he
had
any
vices
she
had
not
heard
of
them
she
knew
he
had
no
thirst
for
drink
or
craze
for
gambling
he
was
considered
a
very
desirable
and
eligible
young
man
madeline
admitted
all
this
then
she
thought
of
things
that
were
perhaps
exclusively
her
own
strange
ideas
boyd
harvey
white
skin
did
not
tan
even
in
this
southwestern
sun
and
wind
his
hands
were
whiter
than
her
own
and
as
soft
they
were
really
beautiful
and
she
remembered
what
care
he
took
of
them
they
were
a
proof
that
he
never
worked
his
frame
was
tall
graceful
elegant
it
did
not
bear
evidence
of
ruggedness
he
had
never
indulged
in
a
sport
more
strenuous
than
yachting
he
hated
effort
and
activity
he
rode
horseback
very
little
disliked
any
but
moderate
motoring
spent
much
time
in
newport
and
europe
never
walked
when
he
could
help
it
and
had
no
ambition
unless
it
were
to
pass
the
days
pleasantly
if
he
ever
had
any
sons
they
would
be
like
him
only
a
generation
more
toward
the
inevitable
extinction
of
his
race
madeline
returned
to
camp
in
just
the
mood
to
make
a
sharp
deciding
contrast
it
happened
fatefully
perhaps
that
the
first
man
she
saw
was
stewart
he
had
just
ridden
into
camp
and
as
she
came
up
he
explained
that
he
had
gone
down
to
the
ranch
for
the
important
mail
about
which
she
had
expressed
anxiety
down
and
back
in
one
day
she
exclaimed
yes
he
replied
it
was
so
but
why
did
you
not
send
one
of
the
boys
and
let
him
make
the
regular
trip
you
were
worried
about
your
mail
he
answered
briefly
as
he
delivered
it
then
he
bent
to
examine
the
fetlocks
of
his
weary
horse
it
was
midsummer
now
madeline
reflected
and
exceedingly
hot
and
dusty
on
the
lower
trail
stewart
had
ridden
down
the
mountain
and
back
again
in
twelve
hours
probably
no
horse
in
the
outfit
except
his
big
black
or
majesty
could
have
stood
that
trip
and
his
horse
showed
the
effects
of
a
grueling
day
he
was
caked
with
dust
and
lame
and
weary
stewart
looked
as
if
he
had
spared
the
horse
his
weight
on
many
a
mile
of
that
rough
ascent
his
boots
were
evidence
of
it
his
heavy
flannel
shirt
wet
through
with
perspiration
adhered
closely
to
his
shoulders
and
arms
so
that
every
ripple
of
muscle
plainly
showed
his
face
was
black
except
round
the
temples
and
forehead
where
it
was
bright
red
drops
of
sweat
running
off
his
blackened
hands
dripped
to
the
ground
he
got
up
from
examining
the
lame
foot
and
then
threw
off
the
saddle
the
black
horse
snorted
and
lunged
for
the
stewart
let
him
drink
a
little
then
with
iron
arms
dragged
him
away
in
this
action
the
man
lithe
powerful
form
impressed
madeline
with
a
wonderful
sense
of
muscular
force
his
brawny
wrist
was
bare
his
big
strong
hand
first
clutching
the
horse
mane
then
patting
his
neck
had
a
bruised
knuckle
and
one
finger
was
bound
up
that
hand
expressed
as
much
gentleness
and
thoughtfulness
for
the
horse
as
it
had
strength
to
drag
him
back
from
too
much
drinking
at
a
dangerous
moment
stewart
was
a
combination
of
fire
strength
and
action
these
attributes
seemed
to
cling
about
him
there
was
something
vital
and
compelling
in
his
presence
worn
and
spent
and
drawn
as
he
was
from
the
long
ride
he
thrilled
madeline
with
his
potential
youth
and
unused
vitality
and
promise
of
things
to
be
deeds
both
of
flesh
and
spirit
in
him
she
saw
the
strength
of
his
forefathers
unimpaired
the
life
in
him
was
marvelously
significant
the
dust
the
dirt
the
sweat
the
soiled
clothes
the
bruised
and
bandaged
hand
the
brawn
and
bone
these
had
not
been
despised
by
the
knights
of
ancient
days
nor
by
modern
women
whose
eyes
shed
soft
light
upon
coarse
and
bloody
toilers
madeline
hammond
compared
the
man
of
the
east
with
the
man
of
the
west
and
that
comparison
was
the
last
parting
regret
for
her
old
standards
xvii
the
lost
mine
of
the
padres
in
the
cool
starry
evenings
the
campers
sat
around
a
blazing
fire
and
told
and
listened
to
stories
thrillingly
fitted
to
the
dark
crags
and
the
wild
solitude
monty
price
had
come
to
shine
brilliantly
as
a
storyteller
he
was
an
atrocious
liar
but
this
fact
would
not
have
been
evident
to
his
enthralled
listeners
if
his
cowboy
comrades
in
base
jealousy
had
not
betrayed
him
the
truth
about
his
remarkable
fabrications
however
had
not
become
known
to
castleton
solely
because
of
the
obtuseness
and
there
was
another
thing
much
stranger
than
this
and
quite
as
amusing
dorothy
coombs
knew
monty
was
a
liar
but
she
was
so
fascinated
by
the
glittering
basilisk
eyes
he
riveted
upon
her
so
taken
in
by
his
horrible
tales
of
blood
that
despite
her
knowledge
she
could
not
help
believing
them
manifestly
monty
was
very
proud
of
his
suddenly
acquired
gift
formerly
he
had
hardly
been
known
to
open
his
lips
in
the
presence
of
strangers
monty
had
developed
more
than
one
singular
and
hitherto
unknown
trait
since
his
supremacy
at
golf
had
revealed
his
possibilities
he
was
as
sober
and
vain
and
pompous
about
his
capacity
for
lying
as
about
anything
else
some
of
the
cowboys
were
jealous
of
him
because
he
held
the
attention
and
apparently
the
admiration
of
the
ladies
and
nels
was
jealous
not
because
monty
made
himself
out
to
be
a
wonderful
but
because
monty
could
tell
a
story
nels
really
had
been
the
hero
of
a
hundred
fights
he
had
never
been
known
to
talk
about
them
but
dorothy
eyes
and
helen
smile
had
somehow
upset
his
modesty
whenever
monty
would
begin
to
talk
nels
would
growl
and
knock
his
pipe
on
a
log
and
make
it
appear
he
could
not
stay
and
listen
though
he
never
really
left
the
charmed
circle
of
the
wild
horses
could
not
have
dragged
him
away
one
evening
at
twilight
as
madeline
was
leaving
her
tent
she
encountered
monty
evidently
he
had
her
with
the
most
mysterious
of
signs
and
whispers
he
led
her
a
little
aside
miss
hammond
i
makin
bold
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
he
said
madeline
smiled
her
willingness
when
they
all
shot
off
their
chins
an
it
i
want
you
to
ask
me
jest
this
way
seein
as
you
hed
more
adventures
than
all
them
put
together
tell
us
about
the
most
turrible
time
you
ever
hed
will
you
ask
me
miss
hammond
jest
kinda
sincere
like
certainly
i
will
monty
she
replied
his
dark
seared
face
had
no
more
warmth
than
a
piece
of
cold
volcanic
rock
which
it
resembled
madeline
appreciated
how
monstrous
dorothy
found
this
burned
and
distorted
visage
how
deformed
the
little
man
looked
to
a
woman
of
refined
sensibilities
it
was
difficult
for
madeline
to
look
into
his
face
but
she
saw
behind
the
blackened
mask
and
now
she
saw
in
monty
deep
eyes
a
spirit
of
pure
fun
so
true
to
her
word
madeline
remembered
at
an
opportune
moment
when
conversation
had
hushed
and
only
the
long
dismal
wail
of
coyotes
broke
the
silence
to
turn
toward
the
little
cowboy
monty
she
said
and
paused
for
effect
monty
seeing
that
you
have
had
more
adventures
than
all
the
cowboys
together
tell
us
about
the
most
terrible
time
you
ever
monty
appeared
startled
at
the
question
that
fastened
all
eyes
upon
him
he
waved
a
deprecatory
hand
aw
miss
hammond
thankin
you
all
fer
the
compliment
hev
to
refuse
replied
monty
laboring
in
distress
it
too
fer
gurls
to
listen
go
on
cried
everybody
except
the
cowboys
nels
began
to
nod
his
head
as
if
he
as
well
as
monty
understood
human
nature
dorothy
hugged
her
knees
with
a
kind
of
shudder
monty
had
fastened
the
hypnotic
eyes
upon
her
castleton
ceased
smoking
adjusted
his
eyeglass
and
prepared
to
listen
in
great
earnestness
monty
changed
his
seat
to
one
where
the
light
from
the
blazing
logs
fell
upon
his
face
and
he
appeared
plunged
into
melancholy
and
profound
thought
now
i
tax
myself
i
ca
jest
decide
which
was
the
orfulest
time
i
ever
hed
he
said
reflectively
here
nels
blew
forth
an
immense
cloud
of
smoke
as
if
he
desired
to
hide
himself
from
sight
monty
pondered
and
then
when
the
smoke
rolled
away
he
turned
to
nels
see
hyar
old
pard
me
an
you
seen
somethin
of
each
other
in
the
panhandle
more
thirty
years
ago
which
we
did
interrupted
nels
bluntly
shore
you
ca
make
me
out
an
ole
mebbe
it
was
so
darn
long
anyhow
nels
you
recollect
them
three
i
hung
all
on
one
an
likewise
thet
blond
gurl
i
rescooed
from
a
band
of
cutthroats
who
murdered
her
paw
ole
bill
warren
the
now
which
of
them
two
scraps
was
the
turriblest
in
your
idee
monty
my
memory
shore
bad
replied
the
unimpeachable
nels
tell
us
about
the
beautiful
blonde
cried
at
least
three
of
the
ladies
dorothy
who
had
suffered
from
nightmare
because
of
a
former
story
of
hanging
men
on
trees
had
voicelessly
appealed
to
monty
to
spare
her
more
of
that
all
right
we
hev
the
blond
gurl
said
monty
settling
back
though
i
ai
thinkin
her
story
is
most
turrible
of
the
two
it
rake
over
tender
affections
long
slumberin
in
my
as
he
paused
there
came
a
sharp
rapping
sound
this
appeared
to
be
nels
knocking
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
on
a
stump
a
true
indication
of
the
passing
of
content
from
that
jealous
cowboy
it
was
down
in
the
panhandle
over
in
the
west
end
of
thet
comanche
an
all
the
redskins
an
outlaws
in
thet
country
were
hidin
in
the
an
chasin
some
of
the
last
buffalo
herds
thet
hed
wintered
in
there
i
was
a
young
buck
them
days
an
purty
much
of
a
desperado
i
thinkin
though
of
all
the
seventeen
notches
on
my
gun
an
each
notch
meant
a
man
killed
face
to
face
there
was
only
one
thet
i
was
ashamed
of
thet
one
was
fer
an
express
messenger
who
i
hit
on
the
head
most
unprofessional
like
jest
because
he
would
hand
over
a
leetle
package
i
hed
the
kind
of
a
reputashun
thet
made
all
the
fellers
in
saloons
smile
an
buy
drinks
well
i
dropped
into
a
place
named
taylor
bend
an
was
peaceful
standin
to
the
bar
when
three
come
in
an
me
bein
with
my
back
turned
they
did
recognize
me
an
got
playful
i
did
stop
drinkin
an
i
did
turn
square
round
but
when
i
stopped
under
my
arm
the
hed
to
go
over
to
the
sawmill
an
fetch
a
heap
of
sawdust
to
cover
up
what
was
left
of
them
three
after
they
was
hauled
out
you
see
i
was
rough
them
days
an
would
shoot
ears
off
an
noses
off
an
hands
off
when
in
later
days
i
jest
kill
a
man
quick
same
as
wild
bill
news
drifts
into
town
thet
night
thet
a
gang
of

log
cabin
where
the
outlaws
hed
a
rondevoo
we
rid
up
boldlike
an
made
a
hell
of
a
racket
then
the
gang
began
to
throw
lead
from
the
cabin
we
all
hunted

fightin
went
on
all

in
the
mornin
all

an
at

i
was
on
the
job
by
my
lonesome
bein
bunged
up
some
myself
i
laid

an
went
down
to
the
river
to
wash
the

a
leetle
while
i
was
down

one
of
the
cutthroats
with
a
bucket
instead

was
about

whole
bunch
of

with
two
more
guns

well
i
mozied
back

a
moonshiny
night
an
i
wondered
if
ole
gun
was
as
purty
as
i
heerd
the
grass
growed
long
round
the
cabin
an
i
crawled
up
to
the

figgered

only
one
door
in
thet
cabin
an
it
was
black
dark
inside
i
jest
grabbed
open
the
door
an
slipped
in
quick
it
worked
all
right
they
heerd
me
but
hed
been
quick
enough
to
ketch
me
in
the
light
of
the
door
of
course
there
was
some
shots
but
i
ducked
too
quick
changed
my
position
ladies
an
gentlemen
thet
there
was
some
dool
by
night
an
i
often
in
the
place
where
they
shot
i
was
most
wonderful
patient
jest
waited
until
one
of
them
darned
ruffians
would
get
so
nervous
hev
to
hunt
me
up
when
mornin
come
there
they
was
all
piled
up
on
the
floor
all
shot
to
pieces
i
found
the
gurl
purty
say
she
was
we
went
down
to
the
river
where
she
begun
to
bathe
my
wounds
i
collected
a
dozen
more
or
so
an
the
sight
of
tears
in
her
lovely
eyes
an
my
blood
of
her
little
hands
jest
wakened
a
trembly
spell
in
my
heart
i
seen
she
was
took
the
same
way
an
thet
settled
it
we
was
comin
up
from
the
river
an
i
hed
jest
straddled
my
hoss
with
the
gurl
behind
when
we

right
into
thet
cutthroat
gang
thet
was
doo
about
then
bein
some
handicapped
i
could
drop
more
one
of
them
an
then
i
hed
to
slope
the
whole
gang
follered
me
an
some
miles
out
chased
me
over
a
ridge
right
into
a
big
herd
of
buffalo
before
i
knowed
what
was
what
thet
herd
broke
into
a
stampede
with
me
in
the
middle
purty
soon
the
buffalo
closed
in
tight
i
knowed
i
was
in
some
peril
then
but
the
gurl
trusted
me
somethin
pitiful
i
seen
again
thet
she
hed
fell
in
love
with
me
i
could
tell
from
the
way
she
hugged
me
an
yelled
before
long
i
was
some
put
to
it
to
keep
my
hoss
on
his
feet
far
as
i
could
see
was
dusty
black
bobbin
shaggy
humps
a
huge
cloud
of
dust
went
along
over
our
heads
the
roar
of
tramplin
hoofs
was
turrible
my
hoss
weakened
went
down
an
was
carried
along
a
leetle
while
i
slipped
off
with
the
gurl
on
to
the
backs
of
the
buffalo
ladies
i
ai
denyin
that
then
monty
price
was
some
scairt
fust
time
in
my
life
but
the
trustin
face
of
thet
gurl
as
she
lay
in
my
arms
an
hugged
me
an
yelled
made
my
spirit
leap
like
a
shootin
star
i
just
began
to
jump
from
buffalo
to
buffalo
i
must
hev
jumped
a
mile
of
them
bobbin
backs
before
i
come
to
open
places
here
where
i
performed
the
greatest
stunts
of
my
life
i
hed
on
my
big

thet

the
little
town
where
she
lived
but
she
was

to
me
married
another
feller
i
was
too
much
a
sport

but
thet
trick
rankled
in

breast
gurls

strange
i
never
stopped
wonderin
how
any
gurl
who

matoor
experience
teaches

thet
sich
is
the
the
cowboys
roared
helen
and
beck
and
edith
laughed
till
they
cried
madeline
found
repression
absolutely
impossible
dorothy
sat
hugging
her
knees
her
horror
at
the
story
no
greater
than
at
unmistakable
reference
to
her
and
to
the
fickleness
of
women
and
castleton
for
the
first
time
appeared
to
be
moved
out
of
his
imperturbability
though
not
in
any
sense
by
humor
indeed
when
he
came
to
notice
it
he
was
dumfounded
by
the
mirth
by
jove
you
americans
are
an
extraordinary
people
he
said
i
see
anything
blooming
funny
in
price
story
of
his
adventure
by
jove
that
was
a
bally
warm
occasion
price
when
you
speak
of
being
frightened
for
the
only
time
in
your
life
i
appreciate
what
you
mean
i
have
experienced
that
i
was
frightened
dook
i
would
hev
thought
it
of
you
replied
monty
i
sure
tolerable
curious
to
hear
about
madeline
and
her
friends
dared
not
break
the
spell
for
fear
that
the
englishman
might
hold
to
his
usual
modest
reticence
he
had
explored
in
brazil
seen
service
in
the
boer
war
hunted
in
india
and
africa
matters
of
experience
of
which
he
never
spoke
upon
this
occasion
however
evidently
taking
monty
recital
word
for
word
as
literal
truth
and
excited
by
it
into
a
homeric
mood
he
might
tell
a
story
the
cowboys
almost
fell
upon
their
knees
in
their
importunity
there
was
a
suppressed
eagerness
in
their
solicitations
a
hint
of
something
that
meant
more
than
desire
great
as
it
was
to
hear
a
story
told
by
an
english
lord
madeline
divined
instantly
that
the
cowboys
had
suddenly
fancied
that
castleton
was
not
the
dense
and
easily
fooled
person
they
had
made
such
game
of
that
he
had
played
his
part
well
that
he
was
having
fun
at
their
expense
that
he
meant
to
tell
a
story
a
lie
which
would
simply
dwarf
monty
nels
keen
bright
expectation
suggested
how
he
would
welcome
the
joke
turned
upon
monty
the
slow
closing
of
monty
cavernous
smile
the
gradual
sinking
of
his
proud
bearing
the
doubt
with
which
he
began
to
regard
castleton
these
were
proofs
of
his
fears
i
have
faced
charging
tigers
and
elephants
in
india
and
charging
rhinos
and
lions
in
africa
began
castleton
his
quick
and
fluent
speech
so
different
from
the
drawl
of
his
ordinary
conversation
but
i
never
was
frightened
but
once
it
will
not
do
to
hunt
those
wild
beasts
if
you
are
easily
balled
up
this
adventure
i
have
in
mind
happened
in
british
east
africa
in
uganda
i
was
out
with
safari
and
we
were
in
a
native
district
much
infested
by
lions
perhaps
i
may
as
well
state
that
are
very
different
from
ordinary
lions
they
are
always
matured
beasts
and
sometimes
indeed
mostly
are
old
they
become
most
likely
by
accident
or
necessity
when
old
they
find
it
more
difficult
to
make
a
kill
being
slower
probably
and
with
poorer
teeth
driven
by
hunger
they
stalk
and
kill
a
native
and
once
having
tasted
human
blood
they
want
no
other
they
become
absolutely
fearless
and
terrible
in
their
attacks
the
natives
of
this
village
near
where
we
camped
were
in
a
terrorized
state
owing
to
depredations
of
two
or
more
the
night
of
our
arrival
a
lion
leaped
a
stockade
fence
seized
a
native
from
among
others
sitting
round
a
fire
and
leaped
out
again
carrying
the
screaming
fellow
away
into
the
darkness
i
determined
to
kill
these
lions
and
made
a
permanent
camp
in
the
village
for
that
purpose
by
day
i
sent
beaters
into
the
brush
and
rocks
of
the
and
by
night
i
watched
every
night
the
lions
visited
us
but
i
did
not
see
one
i
discovered
that
when
they
roared
around
the
camp
they
were
not
so
liable
to
attack
as
when
they
were
silent
it
was
indeed
remarkable
how
silently
they
could
stalk
a
man
they
could
creep
through
a
thicket
so
dense
you
would
not
believe
a
rabbit
could
get
through
and
do
it
without
the
slightest
sound
then
when
ready
to
charge
they
did
so
with
terrible
onslaught
and
roar
they
leaped
right
into
a
circle
of
fires
tore
down
huts
even
dragged
natives
from
the
low
trees
there
was
no
way
to
tell
at
which
point
they
would
make
an
attack
after
ten
days
or
more
of
this
i
was
worn
out
by
loss
of
sleep
and
one
night
when
tired
out
with
watching
i
fell
asleep
my
was
alone
in
the
tent
with
me
a
terrible
roar
awakened
me
then
an
unearthly
scream
pierced
right
into
my
ears
i
always
slept
with
my
rifle
in
my
hands
and
grasping
it
i
tried
to
rise
but
i
could
not
for
the
reason
that
a
lion
was
standing
over
me
then
i
lay
still
the
screams
of
my
told
me
that
the
lion
had
him
i
was
fond
of
this
fellow
and
wanted
to
save
him
i
thought
it
best
however
not
to
move
while
the
lion
stood
over
me
suddenly
he
stepped
and
i
felt
poor
luki
feet
dragging
across
me
he
screamed
me
master
and
instinctively
i
grasped
at
him
and
caught
his
foot
the
lion
walked
out
of
the
tent
dragging
me
as
i
held
to
luki
foot
the
night
was
bright
moonlight
i
could
see
the
lion
distinctly
he
was
a
huge
brute
and
he
held
luki
by
the
shoulder
the
poor
lad
kept
screaming
frightfully
the
must
have
dragged
me
forty
yards
before
he
became
aware
of
a
double
incumbrance
to
his
progress
then
he
halted
and
turned
by
jove
he
made
a
devilish
fierce
object
with
his
shaggy
massive
head
his
eyes
and
his
huge
jaws
holding
luki
i
let
go
of
luki
foot
and
bethought
myself
of
the
gun
but
as
i
lay
there
on
my
side
before
attempting
to
rise
i
made
a
horrible
discovery
i
did
not
have
my
rifle
at
all
i
had
luki
iron
spear
which
he
always
had
near
him
my
rifle
had
slipped
out
of
the
hollow
of
my
arm
and
when
the
lion
awakened
me
in
my
confusion
i
picked
up
luki
spear
instead
the
bloody
brute
dropped
luki
and
uttered
a
roar
that
shook
the
ground
it
was
then
i
felt
frightened
for
an
instant
i
was
almost
paralyzed
the
lion
meant
to
charge
and
in
one
spring
he
could
reach
me
under
circumstances
like
those
a
man
can
think
many
things
in
little
time
i
knew
to
try
to
run
would
be
fatal
i
remembered
how
strangely
lions
had
been
known
to
act
upon
occasion
one
had
been
frightened
by
an
umbrella
one
had
been
frightened
by
a
blast
from
a
another
had
been
frightened
by
a
native
who
in
running
from
one
lion
ran
right
at
the
other
which
he
had
not
seen
accordingly
i
wondered
if
i
could
frighten
the
lion
that
meant
to
leap
at
me
acting
upon
wild
impulse
i
prodded
him
in
the
hind
quarters
with
the
spear
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
am
a
blooming
idiot
if
that
lion
did
not
cower
like
a
whipped
dog
put
his
tail
down
and
begin
to
slink
away
quick
to
see
my
chance
i
jumped
up
yelling
and
made
after
him
prodding
him
again
he
let
out
a
bellow
such
as
you
could
imagine
would
come
from
an
outraged
king
of
beasts
i
prodded
again
and
then
he
loped
off
i
found
luki
not
badly
hurt
in
fact
he
got
well
but
i
never
forgotten
that
when
castleton
finished
his
narrative
there
was
a
trenchant
silence
all
eyes
were
upon
monty
he
looked
beaten
disgraced
a
disgusted
man
yet
there
shone
from
his
face
a
wonderful
admiration
for
castleton
dook
you
win
he
said
and
dropping
his
head
he
left
the
circle
with
the
manner
of
a
deposed
emperor
then
the
cowboys
exploded
the
quiet
serene
nels
yelled
like
a
madman
and
he
stood
upon
his
head
all
the
other
cowboys
went
through
marvelous
contortions
mere
noise
was
insufficient
to
relieve
their
joy
at
what
they
considered
the
fall
and
humiliation
of
the
tyrant
monty
the
englishman
stood
there
and
watched
them
in
amused
consternation
they
baffled
his
understanding
plain
it
was
to
madeline
and
her
friends
that
castleton
had
told
the
simple
truth
but
never
on
the
earth
or
anywhere
else
could
nels
and
his
comrades
have
been
persuaded
that
castleton
had
not
lied
deliberately
to
humble
their
great
exponent
of
ananias
everybody
seemed
reluctant
to
break
the
spell
the
logs
had
burned
out
to
a
great
heap
of
opal
and
gold
and
red
coals
in
the
heart
of
which
quivered
a
glow
alluring
to
the
spirit
of
dreams
as
the
blaze
subsided
the
shadows
of
the
pines
encroached
darker
and
darker
upon
the
circle
of
fading
light
a
cool
wind
fanned
the
embers
whipped
up
flakes
of
white
ashes
and
moaned
through
the
trees
the
wild
yelps
of
coyotes
were
dying
in
the
distance
and
the
sky
was
a
wonderful
dome
spangled
with
white
stars
what
a
perfect
night
said
madeline
this
is
a
night
to
understand
the
dream
the
mystery
the
wonder
of
the
southwest
florence
for
long
you
have
promised
to
tell
us
the
story
of
the
lost
mine
of
the
padres
it
will
give
us
all
pleasure
make
us
understand
something
of
the
thrall
in
which
this
land
held
the
spaniards
who
discovered
it
so
many
years
ago
it
will
be
especially
interesting
now
because
this
mountain
hides
somewhere
under
its
crags
the
treasures
of
the
lost
mine
of
the
in
the
sixteenth
century
florence
began
in
her
soft
slow
voice
so
suited
to
the
nature
of
the
legend
a
poor
young
padre
of
new
spain
was
shepherding
his
goats
upon
a
hill
when
the
virgin
appeared
before
him
he
prostrated
himself
at
her
feet
and
when
he
looked
up
she
was
gone
but
upon
the
maguey
plant
near
where
she
had
stood
there
were
golden
ashes
of
a
strange
and
wonderful
substance
he
took
the
incident
as
a
good
omen
and
went
again
to
the
hilltop
under
the
maguey
had
sprung
up
slender
stalks
of
white
bearing
delicate
gold
flowers
and
as
these
flowers
waved
in
the
wind
a
fine
golden
dust
as
fine
as
powdered
ashes
blew
away
toward
the
north
padre
juan
was
mystified
but
believed
that
great
fortune
attended
upon
him
and
his
poor
people
so
he
went
again
and
again
to
the
hilltop
in
hope
that
the
virgin
would
appear
to
him
one
morning
as
the
sun
rose
gloriously
he
looked
across
the
windy
hill
toward
the
waving
grass
and
golden
flowers
under
the
maguey
and
he
saw
the
virgin
beckoning
to
him
again
he
fell
upon
his
knees
but
she
lifted
him
and
gave
him
of
the
golden
flowers
and
bade
him
leave
his
home
and
people
to
follow
where
these
blowing
golden
ashes
led
there
he
would
find
gold
pure
gold
wonderful
fortune
to
bring
back
to
his
poor
people
to
build
a
church
for
them
and
a
city
padre
juan
took
the
flowers
and
left
his
home
promising
to
return
and
he
traveled
northward
over
the
hot
and
dusty
desert
through
the
mountain
passes
to
a
new
country
where
fierce
and
warlike
indians
menaced
his
life
he
was
gentle
and
good
and
of
a
persuasive
speech
moreover
he
was
young
and
handsome
of
person
the
indians
were
apaches
and
among
them
he
became
a
missionary
while
always
he
was
searching
for
the
flowers
of
gold
he
heard
of
gold
lying
in
pebbles
upon
the
mountain
slopes
but
he
never
found
any
a
few
of
the
apaches
he
converted
the
most
of
them
however
were
prone
to
be
hostile
to
him
and
his
religion
but
padre
juan
prayed
and
worked
on
there
came
a
time
when
the
old
apache
chief
imagining
the
padre
had
designs
upon
his
influence
with
the
tribe
sought
to
put
him
to
death
by
fire
the
chief
daughter
a
beautiful
maiden
secretly
loved
juan
and
believed
in
his
mission
and
she
interceded
for
his
life
and
saved
him
juan
fell
in
love
with
her
one
day
she
came
to
him
wearing
golden
flowers
in
her
dark
hair
and
as
the
wind
blew
the
flowers
a
golden
dust
blew
upon
it
juan
asked
her
where
to
find
such
flowers
and
she
told
him
that
upon
a
certain
day
she
would
take
him
to
the
mountain
to
look
for
them
and
upon
the
day
she
led
up
to
the
from
which
they
could
see
beautiful
valleys
and
great
trees
and
cool
waters
there
at
the
top
of
a
wonderful
slope
that
looked
down
upon
the
world
she
showed
juan
the
flowers
and
juan
found
gold
in
such
abundance
that
he
thought
he
would
go
out
of
his
mind
dust
of
gold
grains
of
gold
pebbles
of
gold
rocks
of
gold
he
was
rich
beyond
all
dreams
he
remembered
the
virgin
and
her
words
he
must
return
to
his
people
and
build
their
church
and
the
great
city
that
would
bear
his
name
but
juan
tarried
always
he
was
going
manana
he
loved
the
apache
girl
so
well
that
he
could
not
leave
her
he
hated
himself
for
his
infidelity
to
his
virgin
to
his
people
he
was
weak
and
false
a
sinner
but
he
could
not
go
and
he
gave
himself
up
to
love
of
the
indian
maiden
the
old
apache
chief
discovered
the
secret
love
of
his
daughter
and
the
padre
and
fierce
in
his
anger
he
took
her
up
into
the
mountains
and
burned
her
alive
and
cast
her
ashes
upon
the
wind
he
did
not
kill
padre
juan
he
was
too
wise
and
perhaps
too
cruel
for
he
saw
the
strength
of
juan
love
besides
many
of
his
tribe
had
learned
much
from
the
spaniard
padre
juan
fell
into
despair
he
had
no
desire
to
live
he
faded
and
wasted
away
but
before
he
died
he
went
to
the
old
indians
who
had
burned
the
maiden
and
he
begged
them
when
he
was
dead
to
burn
his
body
and
to
cast
his
ashes
to
the
wind
from
that
wonderful
slope
where
they
would
blow
away
to
mingle
forever
with
those
of
his
indian
sweetheart
the
indians
promised
and
when
padre
juan
died
they
burned
his
body
and
took
his
ashes
to
the
mountain
heights
and
cast
them
to
the
wind
where
they
drifted
and
fell
to
mix
with
the
ashes
of
the
indian
girl
he
had
loved
years
passed
more
padres
traveled
across
the
desert
to
the
home
of
the
apaches
and
they
heard
the
story
of
juan
among
their
number
was
a
padre
who
in
his
youth
had
been
one
of
juan
people
he
set
forth
to
find
juan
grave
where
he
believed
he
would
also
find
the
gold
and
he
came
back
with
pebbles
of
gold
and
flowers
that
shed
a
golden
dust
and
he
told
a
wonderful
story
he
had
climbed
and
climbed
into
the
mountains
and
he
had
come
to
a
wonderful
slope
under
the
crags
that
slope
was
yellow
with
golden
flowers
when
he
touched
them
golden
ashes
drifted
from
them
and
blew
down
among
the
rocks
there
the
padre
found
dust
of
gold
grains
of
gold
pebbles
of
gold
rocks
of
gold
then
all
the
padres
went
into
the
mountains
but
the
discoverer
of
the
mine
lost
his
way
they
searched
and
searched
until
they
were
old

of

bonita
florence
story
of
the
lost
mine
fired
madeline
guests
with
the
fever
for
but
after
they
had
tried
it
a
few
times
and
the
glamour
of
the
thing
wore
off
they
gave
up
and
remained
in
camp
having
exhausted
all
the
resources
of
the
mountain
such
that
had
interest
for
them
they
settled
quietly
down
for
a
rest
which
madeline
knew
would
soon
end
in
a
desire
for
civilized
comforts
they
were
almost
tired
of
roughing
it
helen
discontent
manifested
itself
in
her
remark
i
guess
nothing
is
going
to
happen
after
madeline
awaited
their
pleasure
in
regard
to
the
breaking
of
camp
and
meanwhile
as
none
of
them
cared
for
more
exertion
she
took
her
walks
without
them
sometimes
accompanied
by
one
of
the
cowboys
always
by
the
these
walks
furnished
her
exceeding
pleasure
and
now
that
the
cowboys
would
talk
to
her
without
reserve
she
grew
fonder
of
listening
to
their
simple
stories
the
more
she
knew
of
them
the
more
she
doubted
the
wisdom
of
lives
companionship
with
nels
and
most
of
the
cowboys
was
in
its
effect
like
that
of
the
rugged
pines
and
crags
and
the
untainted
wind
humor
their
predominant
trait
when
a
person
grew
to
know
them
saved
madeline
from
finding
their
hardness
trying
they
were
dreamers
as
all
men
who
lived
lonely
lives
in
the
wilds
were
dreamers
the
cowboys
all
had
secrets
madeline
learned
some
of
them
she
marveled
most
at
the
strange
way
in
which
they
hid
emotions
except
of
violence
of
mirth
and
temper
so
easily
aroused
it
was
all
the
more
remarkable
in
view
of
the
fact
that
they
felt
intensely
over
little
things
to
which
men
of
the
world
were
blind
and
dead
madeline
had
to
believe
that
a
hard
and
perilous
life
in
a
barren
and
wild
country
developed
great
principles
in
men
living
close
to
earth
under
the
cold
bleak
peaks
on
the
desert
men
grew
like
the
nature
that
developed
them
hard
fierce
terrible
perhaps
but
big
big
with
elemental
force
but
one
day
while
out
walking
alone
before
she
realized
it
she
had
gone
a
long
way
down
a
dim
trail
winding
among
the
rocks
it
was
the
middle
of
a
summer
afternoon
and
all
about
her
were
shadows
of
the
crags
crossing
the
sunlit
patches
the
quiet
was
undisturbed
she
went
on
and
on
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
she
was
perhaps
going
too
far
from
camp
but
risking
it
because
she
was
sure
of
her
way
back
and
enjoying
the
wild
craggy
recesses
that
were
new
to
her
finally
she
came
out
upon
a
bank
that
broke
abruptly
into
a
beautiful
little
glade
here
she
sat
down
to
rest
before
undertaking
the
return
trip
suddenly
russ
the
keener
of
the
raised
his
head
and
growled
madeline
feared
he
might
have
scented
a
or
wildcat
she
quieted
him
and
carefully
looked
around
to
each
side
was
an
irregular
line
of
massive
blocks
of
stone
that
had
weathered
from
the
crags
the
little
glade
was
open
and
grassy
with
here
a
there
a
boulder
the
outlet
seemed
to
go
down
into
a
wilderness
of
canyons
and
ridges
looking
in
this
direction
madeline
saw
the
slight
dark
figure
of
a
woman
coming
stealthily
along
under
the
pines
madeline
was
amazed
then
a
little
frightened
for
that
stealthy
walk
from
tree
to
tree
was
suggestive
of
secrecy
if
nothing
worse
presently
the
woman
was
joined
by
a
tall
man
who
carried
a
package
which
he
gave
to
her
they
came
on
up
the
glade
and
appeared
to
be
talking
earnestly
in
another
moment
madeline
recognized
stewart
she
had
no
greater
feeling
of
surprise
than
had
at
first
been
hers
but
for
the
next
moment
she
scarcely
thought
at
all
merely
watched
the
couple
approaching
in
a
flash
came
back
her
former
curiosity
as
to
strange
absences
from
camp
and
then
with
the
return
of
her
doubt
of
him
the
recognition
of
the
woman
the
small
dark
head
the
brown
face
the
big
eyes
madeline
now
saw
distinctly
belonged
to
the
mexican
girl
bonita
stewart
had
met
her
there
this
was
the
secret
of
his
lonely
trips
taken
ever
since
he
had
come
to
work
for
madeline
this
secluded
glade
was
a
rendezvous
he
had
her
hidden
there
quietly
madeline
arose
with
a
gesture
to
the
dogs
and
went
back
along
the
trail
toward
camp
succeeding
her
surprise
was
a
feeling
of
sorrow
that
stewart
regeneration
had
not
been
complete
sorrow
gave
place
to
insufferable
distrust
that
while
she
had
been
romancing
about
this
cowboy
dreaming
of
her
good
influence
over
him
he
had
been
merely
base
somehow
it
stung
her
stewart
had
been
nothing
to
her
she
thought
yet
she
had
been
proud
of
him
she
tried
to
revolve
the
thing
to
be
fair
to
him
when
every
instinctive
tendency
was
to
expel
him
and
all
pertaining
to
him
from
her
thoughts
and
her
effort
at
sympathy
at
extenuation
failed
utterly
before
her
pride
exerting
her
she
dismissed
stewart
from
her
mind
madeline
did
not
think
of
him
again
till
late
that
afternoon
when
as
she
was
leaving
her
tent
to
join
several
of
her
guests
stewart
appeared
suddenly
in
her
path
miss
hammond
i
saw
your
tracks
down
the
trail
he
began
eagerly
but
his
tone
was
easy
and
natural
i
thinking
well
maybe
you
sure
got
the
idea
i
do
not
wish
for
an
explanation
interrupted
madeline
stewart
gave
a
slight
start
his
manner
had
a
semblance
of
the
old
cool
audacity
as
he
looked
down
at
her
it
subtly
changed
what
effrontery
madeline
thought
to
face
her
before
her
guests
with
an
explanation
of
his
conduct
suddenly
she
felt
an
inward
flash
of
fire
that
was
pain
so
strange
so
incomprehensible
that
her
mind
whirled
then
anger
possessed
her
not
at
stewart
but
at
herself
that
anything
could
rouse
in
her
a
raw
emotion
she
stood
there
outwardly
cold
serene
with
level
haughty
eyes
upon
stewart
but
inwardly
she
was
burning
with
rage
and
shame
i
sure
not
going
to
have
you
think
he
began
passionately
but
he
broke
off
and
a
slow
dull
crimson
blotted
over
the
healthy
of
his
neck
and
cheeks
what
you
do
or
think
stewart
is
no
concern
of
miss
miss
hammond
you
do
believe
faltered
stewart
the
crimson
receded
from
his
face
leaving
it
pale
his
eyes
were
appealing
they
had
a
kind
of
timid
look
that
struck
madeline
even
in
her
anger
there
was
something
boyish
about
him
then
he
took
a
step
forward
and
reached
out
with
his
hand
in
a
gesture
that
was
humble
yet
held
a
certain
dignity
but
listen
never
mind
now
what
you
you
think
about
me
there
a
good
reason
i
have
no
wish
to
hear
your
but
you
ought
to
he
persisted
sir
stewart
underwent
another
swift
change
he
started
violently
a
dark
tide
shaded
his
face
and
a
glitter
leaped
to
his
eyes
he
took
two
long
strides
loomed
over
her
i
not
thinking
about
myself
he
thundered
will
you
listen
no
she
replied
and
there
was
freezing
hauteur
in
her
voice
with
a
slight
gesture
of
dismissal
unmistakable
in
its
finality
she
turned
her
back
upon
him
then
she
joined
her
guests
stewart
stood
perfectly
motionless
then
slowly
he
began
to
lift
his
right
hand
in
which
he
held
his
sombrero
he
swept
it
up
and
up
high
over
his
head
his
tall
form
towered
with
fierce
suddenness
he
flung
his
sombrero
down
he
leaped
at
his
black
horse
and
dragged
him
to
where
his
saddle
lay
with
one
pitch
he
tossed
the
saddle
upon
the
back
his
strong
hands
flashed
at
girths
and
straps
every
action
was
swift
decisive
fierce
bounding
for
his
bridle
which
hung
over
a
bush
he
ran
against
a
cowboy
who
awkwardly
tried
to
avoid
the
onslaught
get
out
of
my
way
he
yelled
then
with
the
same
savage
haste
he
adjusted
the
bridle
on
his
horse

stewart
raised
his
dark
face
everybody
listened
and
everybody
heard
the
rapid
beat
of
a
horse
hoofs
the
sun
had
set
but
the
park
was
light
nels
appeared
down
the
trail
and
his
horse
was
running
in
another
moment
he
was
in
the
circle
pulling
his
bay
back
to
a
sliding
halt
he
leaped
off
abreast
of
stewart
madeline
saw
and
felt
a
difference
in
nels
presence
what
up
gene
he
queried
sharply
i
leaving
camp
replied
stewart
thickly
his
black
horse
began
to
stamp
as
stewart
grasped
bridle
and
mane
and
kicked
the
stirrup
round
nels
long
arm
shot
out
and
his
hand
fell
upon
stewart
holding
him
down
shore

stepped
back
instantly

seemed
to

wild
passion

an
now
his
strange
speech
checked
the
mounting
cowboy
stewart
stepped
down
from
the
stirrup
then
their
hard
faces
were
still
and
cold
while
their
eyes
locked
glances
madeline
was
as
much
startled
by
nels
speech
as
stewart
quick
to
note
a
change
in
these
men
she
now
sensed
one
that
was
unfathomable
resign
questioned
stewart
shore

his
voice

up
against

hell
of
a
proposition
how
significant
was
the
effect
of
his
words
upon
all
the
cowboys
stewart
made
a
fierce
and
violent
motion
terrible
where
his
other
motions
had
been
but
passionate
monty
leaped
straight
up
into
the
air
in
a
singular
action
as
suggestive
of
surprise
as
it
was
of
wild
acceptance
of
menace
like
a
stalking
giant
nick
steele
strode
over
to
nels
and
stewart
the
other
cowboys
rose
silently
without
a
word
madeline
and
her
guests
in
a
little
group
watched
and
listened
unable
to
divine
what
all
this
strange
talk
and
action
meant
hold
on
nels
they
do
need
to
hear
it
said
stewart
hoarsely
as
he
waved
a

strident
voice

had
as
decided
an
effect
as
any
preceding
words
or
action
perhaps
it
was
the
last
thing
needed
to
transform
these
men
doing
unaccustomed
duty
as
escorts
of
beautiful
women
to
their
natural
state

xix
don
carlos
stewart
took
nels
monty
and
nick
steele
aside
out
of
earshot
and
they
evidently
entered
upon
an
earnest
colloquy
presently
the
other
cowboys
were
called
they
all
talked
more
or
less
but
the
deep
voice
of
stewart
predominated
over
the
others
then
the
consultation
broke
up
and
the
cowboys
scattered
rustle
you
indians
ordered
stewart
the
ensuing
scene
of
action
was
not
reassuring
to
madeline
and
her
friends
they
were
quiet
awaiting
some
one
to
tell
them
what
to
do
at
the
offset
the
cowboys
appeared
to
have
forgotten
madeline
some
of
them
ran
off
into
the
woods
others
into
the
open
grassy
places
where
they
rounded
up
the
horses
and
burros
several
cowboys
spread
tarpaulins
upon
the
ground
and
began
to
select
and
roll
small
packs
evidently
for
hurried
travel
nels
mounted
his
horse
to
ride
down
the
trail
monty
and
nick
steele
went
off
into
the
grove
leading
their
horses
stewart
climbed
up
a
steep
jumble
of
stone
between
two
sections
of
low
cracked
cliff
back
of
the
camp
castleton
offered
to
help
the
packers
and
was
curtly
told
he
would
be
in
the
way
madeline

all
importuned
her
was
there
real
danger
were
the
guerrillas
coming
would
a
start
be
made
at
once
for
the
ranch
why
had
the
cowboys
suddenly
become
so
different
madeline
answered
as
best
she
could
but
her
replies
were
only
conjecture
and
modified
to
allay
the
fears
of
her
guests
helen
was
in
a
white
glow
of
excitement
soon
cowboys
appeared
riding
barebacked
horses
driving
in
others
and
the
burros
some
of
these
horses
were
taken
away
and
evidently
hidden
in
deep
recesses
between
the
crags
the
string
of
burros
were
packed
and
sent
off
down
the
trail
in
charge
of
a
cowboy
nick
steele
and
monty
returned
then
stewart
appeared
clambering
down
the
break
between
the
cliffs
his
next
move
was
to
order
all
the
baggage
belonging
to
madeline
and
her
guests
taken
up
the
cliff
this
was
strenuous
toil
requiring
the
need
of
lassoes
to
haul
up
the
effects
get
ready
to
climb
said
stewart
turning
to
madelines
party
where
asked
helen
he
waved
his
hand
at
the
ascent
to
be
made
exclamations
of
dismay
followed
his
gesture
mr
stewart
is
there
danger
asked
dorothy
and
her
voice
trembled
this
was
the
question
madeline
had
upon
her
lips
to
ask
stewart
but
she
could
not
speak
it
no
there
no
danger
replied
stewart
but
we
taking
precautions
we
all
agreed
on
as
dorothy
whispered
that
she
believed
stewart
lied
castleton
asked
another
question
and
then
harvey
followed
suit
beck
made
a
timid
query
please
keep
quiet
and
do
as
you
told
said
stewart
bluntly
at
this
juncture
when
the
last
of
the
baggage
was
being
hauled
up
the
cliff
monty
approached
madeline
and
removed
his
sombrero
his
black
face
seemed
the
same
yet
this
was
a
vastly
changed
monty
miss
hammond
i
givin
notice
i
resign
my
job
he
said
monty
what
do
you
mean
what
does
nels
mean
now
when
danger
threatens
we
jest
quit
thet
all
replied
monty
tersely
he
was
stern
and
somber
he
could
not
stand
still
his
eyes
roved
everywhere
castleton
jumped
up
from
the
log
where
he
had
been
sitting
and
his
face
was
very
red
mr
price
does
all
this
blooming
fuss
mean
we
are
to
be
robbed
or
attacked
or
abducted
by
a
lot
of
ragamuffin
guerrillas
you
called
the
dorothy
turned
a
very
pale
face
toward
monty
mr
price
you
would
you
could
desert
us
now
you
and
nels
desert

asked
monty
blankly
yes

us
when
we
may
need
you
so
much
with
something
dreadful
monty
uttered
a
short
hard
laugh
as
he
bent
a
strange
look
upon
the
girl
me
an
nels
is
purty
much
scared
an
we
goin
to
slope
miss
dorothy
bein
as

round
so
much
it
sorta
hurts
us
to
see
nice
young
girls
dragged
off
by
the
dorothy
uttered
a
little
cry
and
then
became
hysterical
castleton
for
once
was
fully
aroused
by
gad
you
and
your
partner
are
a
couple
of
blooming
cowards
where
now
is
that
courage
you
boasted
of
monty
dark
face
expressed
extreme
sarcasm
dook
in
my
time
i

bright
fellers
but
you
take
the
cake
it
most
marvelous
how
bright
you

a
swell
story
fer
your
english
chums
bah

how
you
seen
two
run
like
scared
from
a
lot
of
greasers
like
hell
you
will
unless
you
lie
like
the
time
you
told
about
proddin
the
lion
that
there
story
allus
monty
shut
up
yelled
stewart
as
he
came
hurriedly
up
then
monty
slouched
away
cursing
to
himself
madeline
and
helen
assisted
by
castleton
worked
over
dorothy
and
with
some
difficulty
quieted
her
stewart
passed
several
times
without
noticing
them
and
monty
who
had
been
so
ridiculously
eager
to
pay
every
little
attention
to
dorothy
did
not
see
her
at
all
rude
it
seemed
in
monty
ease
more
than
that
madeline
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
it
stewart
directed
cowboys
to
go
to
the
head
of
the
open
place
in
the
cliff
and
let
down
lassoes
then
with
little
waste
of
words
he
urged
the
women
toward
this
rough
ladder
of
stones
we
want
to
hide
you
he
said
when
they
demurred
if
the
guerrillas
come
we
tell
them
you
all
gone
down
to
the
ranch
if
we
have
to
fight
you
be
safe
up
helen
stepped
boldly
forward
and
let
stewart
put
the
loop
of
a
lasso
round
her
and
tighten
it
he
waved
his
hand
to
the
cowboys
above
just
walk
up
now
he
directed
helen
it
proved
to
the
watchers
to
be
an
easy
safe
and
rapid
means
of
scaling
the
steep
passage
the
men
climbed
up
without
assistance
beck
as
usual
had
hysteria
she
half
walked
and
was
half
dragged
up
stewart
supported
dorothy
with
one
arm
while
with
the
other
he
held
to
the
lasso
ambrose
had
to
carry
christine
the
mexican
women
required
no
assistance
edith
wayne
and
madeline
climbed
last
and
once
up
madeline
saw
a
narrow
bench
thick
with
shrubs
and
overshadowed
by
huge
leaning
crags
there
were
holes
in
the
rock
and
dark
fissures
leading
back
it
was
a
rough
wild
place
tarpaulins
and
bedding
were
then
hauled
up
and
food
and
water
the
cowboys
spread
comfortable
beds
in
several
of
the
caves
and
told
madeline
and
her
friends
to
be
as
quiet
as
possible
not
to
make
a
light
and
to
sleep
dressed
ready
for
travel
at
a
moment
notice
after
the
cowboys
had
gone
down
it
was
not
a
cheerful
group
left
there
in
the
darkening
twilight
castleton
prevailed
upon
them
to
eat
this
is
simply
great
whispered
helen
oh
it
awful
moaned
dorothy
it
your
fault
helen
you
prayed
for
something
to
i
believe
it
a
horrid
trick
those
cowboys
are
playing
said
beck
madeline
assured
her
friends
that
no
trick
was
being
played
upon
them
and
that
she
deplored
the
discomfort
and
distress
but
felt
no
real
alarm
she
was
more
inclined
to
evasive
kindness
here
than
to
sincerity
for
she
had
a
decided
uneasiness
the
swift
change
in
the
manner
and
looks
of
her
cowboys
had
been
a
shock
to
her
the
last
glance
she
had
of
stewart
face
then
stern
almost
sad
and
haggard
with
worry
remained
to
augment
her
foreboding
darkness
appeared
to
drop
swiftly
down
the
coyotes
began
their
haunting
mournful
howls
the
stars
showed
and
grew
brighter
the
wind
moaned
through
the
tips
of
the
pines
castleton
was
restless
he
walked
to
and
fro
before
the
overhanging
shelf
of
rock
where
his
companions
sat
lamenting
and
presently
he
went
out
to
the
ledge
of
the
bench
the
cowboys
below
had
built
a
fire
and
the
light
from
it
rose
in
a
huge
glow
castleton
little
figure
stood
out
black
against
this
light
curious
and
anxious
also
madeline
joined
him
and
peered
down
from
the
cliff
the
distance
was
short
and
occasionally
she
could
distinguish
a
word
spoken
by
the
cowboys
they
were
unconcernedly
cooking
and
eating
she
marked
the
absence
of
stewart
and
mentioned
it
to
castleton
silently
castleton
pointed
almost
straight
down
and
there
in
the
gloom
stood
stewart
with
the
two
at
his
feet
presently
nick
steele
silenced
the
circle
by
raising
a
warning
hand
the
cowboys
bent
their
heads
listening
madeline
listened
with
all
her
might
she
heard
one
of
the
hounds
whine
then
the
faint
beat
of
horse
hoofs
nick
spoke
again
and
turned
to
his
supper
and
the
other
men
seemed
to
slacken
in
attention
the
beat
of
hoofs
grew
louder
entered
the
grove
then
the
circle
of
light
the
rider
was
nels
he
dismounted
and
the
sound
of
his
low
voice
just
reached
madeline
gene
it
nels
somethin
doin
madeline
heard
one
of
the
cowboys
call
softly
send
him
over
replied
stewart
nels
stalked
away
from
the
fire
see
here
nels
the
boys
are
all
right
but
i
do
want
them
to
know
everything
about
this
said
stewart
as
nels
came
up
did

find
the
girl
madeline
guessed
that
stewart
referred
to
the
mexican
girl
bonita

deep
under

all
right
nels
old
friend
and
thanks
replied
stewart
nels
returned
to
the
and
stewart
resumed
his
silent
guard
madeline
led
castleton
away
from
the
brink
of
the
wall
by
jove
cowboys
are
blooming
strange
folk
he
exclaimed
they
are
not
what
they
pretend
to
indeed
you
are
right
replied
madeline
i
can
not
understand
them
come
let
us
tell
the
others
that
nels
and
monty
were
only
talking
and
do
not
intend
to
leave
us
dorothy
at
least
will
be
less
frightened
if
she
dorothy
was
somewhat
comforted
the
others
however
complained
of
the
cowboys
singular
behavior
more
than
once
the
idea
was
advanced
that
an
elaborate
trick
had
been
concocted
upon
general
discussion
this
idea
gained
ground
madeline
did
not
combat
it
because
she
saw
it
tended
to
a
less
perturbed
condition
of
mind
among
her
guests
castleton
for
once
proved
that
he
was
not
absolutely
obtuse
and
helped
along
the
idea
they
sat
talking
in
low
voices
until
a
late
hour
the
incident
now
began
to
take
on
the
nature
of
helen
adventure
some
of
the
party
even
grew
merry
in
a
subdued
way
then
gradually
one
by
one
they
tired
and
went
to
bed
helen
vowed
she
could
not
sleep
in
a
place
where
there
were
bats
and
crawling
things
madeline
fancied
however
that
they
all
went
to
sleep
while
she
lay
staring
up
at
the
black
bulge
of
overhanging
rock
and
beyond
the
starry
sky
to
keep
from
thinking
of
stewart
and
the
burning
anger
he
had
caused
her
to
feel
for
herself
madeline
tried
to
keep
her
mind
on
other
things
but
thought
of
him
recurred
and
each
time
there
was
a
hot
commotion
in
her
breast
hard
to
stifle
intelligent
reasoning
seemed
out
of
her
power
in
the
daylight
it
had
been
possible
for
her
to
be
oblivious
to
stewart
deceit
after
the
moment
of
its
realization
at
night
however
in
the
strange
silence
and
hovering
shadows
of
gloom
with
the
speaking
stars
seeming
to
call
to
her
with
the
moan
of
the
wind
in
the
pines
and
the
melancholy
mourn
of
coyotes
in
the
distance
she
was
not
able
to
govern
her
thought
and
emotion
the
day
was
practical
cold
the
night
was
strange
and
tense
in
the
darkness
she
had
fancies
wholly
unknown
to
her
in
the
bright
light
of
the
sun
she
battled
with
a
haunting
thought
she
had
inadvertently
heard
nels
conversation
with
stewart
she
had
listened
hoping
to
hear
some
good
news
or
to
hear
the
worst
she
had
learned
both
and
moreover
enlightenment
on
one
point
of
complex
motives
he
wished
to
spare
her
any
sight
that
might
offend
frighten
or
disgust
her
yet
this
stewart
who
showed
a
fineness
of
feeling
that
might
have
been
wanting
even
in
boyd
harvey
maintained
a
secret
rendezvous
with
that
pretty
abandoned
bonita
here
always
the
hot
shame
like
a
live
stinging
internal
fire
abruptly
ended
madeline
thought
it
was
intolerable
and
it
was
the
more
so
because
she
could
neither
control
nor
understand
it
the
hours
wore
on
and
at
length
as
the
stars
began
to
pale
and
there
was
no
sound
whatever
she
fell
asleep
she
was
called
out
of
her
slumber
day
had
broken
bright
and
cool
the
sun
was
still
below
the
eastern
crags
ambrose
with
several
other
cowboys
had
brought
up
buckets
of
and
hot
coffee
and
cakes
madeline
party
appeared
to
be
none
the
worse
for
the
experience
indeed
the
meager
breakfast
might
have
been
as
merrily
partaken
of
as
it
was
hungrily
had
not
ambrose
enjoined
silence
they
expectin
company
down
below
he
said
this
information
and
the
summary
manner
in
which
the
cowboys
soon
led
the
party
higher
up
among
the
ruined
shelves
of
rock
caused
a
recurrence
of
anxiety
madeline
insisted
on
not
going
beyond
a
projection
of
cliff
from
which
she
could
see
directly
down
into
the
camp
as
the
was
one
affording
concealment
ambrose
consented
but
he
placed
the
frightened
christine
near
madeline
and
remained
there
himself
ambrose
do
you
really
think
the
guerrillas
will
come
asked
madeline
sure
we
know
nels
just
rode
in
and
said
they
were
on
their
way
up
miss
hammond
can
i
trust
you
you
wo
let
out
a
squeal
if
there
a
fight
down
there
stewart
told
me
to
hide
you
out
of
sight
or
keep
you
from
i
promise
not
to
make
any
noise
replied
madeline
madeline
arranged
her
coat
so
that
she
could
lie
upon
it
and
settled
down
to
wait
developments
there
came
a
slight
rattling
of
stones
in
the
rear
she
turned
to
see
helen
sliding
down
a
bank
with
a
perplexed
and
troubled
cowboy
helen
came
stooping
low
to
where
madeline
lay
and
said
i
am
going
to
see
what
happens
if
i
die
in
the
attempt
i
can
stand
it
if
you
she
was
pale
and
ambrose
promptly
swore
at
the
cowboy
who
had
let
her
get
away
from
him
take
a
on
her
yourself
an
see
where
you
end
up
replied
the
fellow
and
disappeared
in
the
jumble
of
rocks
ambrose
finding
words
useless
sternly
and
heroically
prepared
to
carry
helen
back
to
the
others
he
laid
hold
of
her
in
a
fury
with
eyes
blazing
helen
whispered
let
go
of
me
majesty
what
does
this
fool
mean
madeline
laughed
she
knew
helen
and
had
marked
the
whisper
when
ordinarily
helen
would
have
spoken
imperiously
and
not
low
madeline
explained
to
her
the
exigency
of
the
situation
i
might
run
but
never
scream
said
helen
with
that
ambrose
had
to
be
content
to
let
her
stay
however
he
found
her
a
place
somewhat
farther
back
from
madeline
position
where
he
said
there
was
less
danger
of
her
being
seen
then
he
sternly
bound
her
to
silence
tarried
a
moment
to
comfort
christine
and
returned
to
where
madeline
lay
concealed
he
had
been
there
scarcely
a
moment
when
he
whispered
i
hear
hosses
the
guerrillas
are
madeline
was
well
protected
from
possible
discovery
from
below
she
could
peep
over
a
kind
of
parapet
through
an
opening
in
the
tips
of
the
pines
that
reached
up
to
the
cliff
and
obtain
a
commanding
view
of
the
camp
circle
and
its
immediate
surroundings
she
could
not
however
see
far
either
to
right
or
left
of
the
camp
owing
to
the
obstructing
foliage
presently
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
quickened
the
beat
of
her
pulse
and
caused
her
to
turn
keener
gaze
upon
the
cowboys
below
although
she
had
some
inkling
of
the
course
stewart
and
his
men
were
to
pursue
she
was
not
by
any
means
prepared
for
the
indifference
she
saw
frank
was
asleep
or
pretended
to
be
three
cowboys
were
lazily
and
unconcernedly
attending
to
duties
such
as
baking
biscuits
watching
the
ovens
and
washing
tins
and
pots
the
elaborate
set
of
aluminum
plates
cups
together
with
the
other
camp
fixtures
that
had
done
service
for
madeline
party
had
disappeared
nick
steele
sat
with
his
back
to
a
log
smoking
his
pipe
another
cowboy
had
just
brought
the
horses
closer
into
camp
where
they
stood
waiting
to
be
saddled
nels
appeared
to
be
fussing
over
a
pack
stewart
was
rolling
a
cigarette
monty
had
apparently
nothing
to
do
for
the
present
except
whistle
which
he
was
doing
much
more
loudly
than
melodiously
the
whole
ensemble
gave
an
impression
of
careless
indifference
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
grew
louder
and
slowed
its
beat
one
of
the
cowboys
pointed
down
the
trail
toward
which
several
of
his
comrades
turned
their
heads
for
a
moment
then
went
on
with
their
occupations
presently
a
shaggy
dusty
horse
bearing
a
lean
ragged
dark
rider
rode
into
camp
and
halted
another
followed
and
another
horses
with
mexican
riders
came
in
single
file
and
stopped
behind
the
leader
the
cowboys
looked
up
and
the
guerrillas
looked
down
buenos
dias
senor
ceremoniously
said
the
foremost
guerrilla
by
straining
her
ears
madeline
heard
that
voice
and
she
recognized
it
as
belonging
to
don
carlos
his
graceful
bow
to
stewart
was
also
familiar
otherwise
she
would
never
have
recognized
the
former
elegant
vaquero
in
this
uncouth
roughly
dressed
mexican
stewart
answered
the
greeting
in
spanish
and
waving
his
hand
toward
the
added
in
english
get
down
and
the
guerrillas
were
anything
but
slow
in
complying
they
crowded
to
the
fire
then
spread
in
a
little
circle
and
squatted
upon
the
ground
laying
their
weapons
beside
them
in
appearance
they
tallied
with
the
band
of
guerrillas
that
had
carried
madeline
up
into
the
foothills
only
this
band
was
larger
and
better
armed
the
men
moreover
were
just
as
hungry
and
as
wild
and
beggarly
the
cowboys
were
not
cordial
in
their
reception
of
this
visit
but
they
were
hospitable
the
law
of
the
desert
had
always
been
to
give
food
and
drink
to
wayfaring
men
whether
lost
or
hunted
or
hunting
there
in
that
outfit
whispered
ambrose
four
white
men
pretty
rummy
they
appear
to
be
friendly
enough
whispered
madeline
things
down
there
ai
what
they
seem
replied
ambrose
ambrose
tell
me
explain
to
me
this
is
my
opportunity
as
long
as
you
will
let
me
watch
them
please
let
me
know
the
the
real
sure
but
recollect
miss
hammond
that
gene
give
it
to
me
good
if
he
ever
knows
i
let
you
look
and
told
you
what
what
well
gene
is
seen
them
poor
devils
get
a
square
meal
they
only
a
lot
of
in
this
country
across
the
border
they
bandits
some
of
them
the
others
just
riffraff
outlaws
that
rebel
bluff
does
go
down
with
us
i
have
to
see
first
before
i
believe
them
greasers
would
fight
they
a
lot
of
thieves
and
they
steal
a
blanket
or
tobacco
gene
thinks
they
after
you
ladies
to
carry
you
off
but
gene
oh
gene
some
highfalutin
in
his
ideas
lately
most
of
us
boys
think
the
guerrillas
are
out
to
rob
that
whatever
might
have
been
the
secret
motive
of
don
carlos
and
his
men
they
did
not
allow
it
to
interfere
with
a
hearty
appreciation
of
a
generous
amount
of
food
plainly
each
individual
ate
all
that
he
was
able
to
eat
at
the
time
they
jabbered
like
a
flock
of
parrots
some
were
even
merry
in
a
kind
of
wild
way
then
as
each
and
every
one
began
to
roll
and
smoke
the
inevitable
cigarette
of
the
mexican
there
was
a
subtle
change
in
manner
they
smoked
and
looked
about
the
camp
off
into
the
woods
up
at
the
crags
and
back
at
the
leisurely
cowboys
they
had
the
air
of
men
waiting
for
something
senor
began
don
carlos
addressing
stewart
as
he
spoke
he
swept
his
sombrero
to
indicate
the
camp
circle
madeline
could
not
distinguish
his
words
but
his
gesture
plainly
indicated
a
question
in
regard
to
the
rest
of
the
camping
party
stewart
reply
and
the
wave
of
his
hand
down
the
trail
meant
that
his
party
had
gone
home
stewart
turned
to
some
task
and
the
guerrilla
leader
quietly
smoked
he
looked
cunning
and
thoughtful
his
men
gradually
began
to
manifest
a
restlessness
noticeable
in
the
absence
of
former
languor
and
slow
puffing
of
cigarette
smoke
presently
a
man
with
a
bullet
head
and
a
blistered
red
face
of
evil
coarseness
got
up
and
threw
away
his
cigarette
he
was
an
american
hey
cull
he
called
in
loud
voice
ai
ye
goin
to
cough
up
a
drink
my
boys
do
carry
liquor
on
the
trail
replied
stewart
he
turned
now
to
face
the
guerrillas
haw
haw
i
heerd
over
in
rodeo
thet
ye
was
gittin
to
be
shore
some
fer
temperance
said
this
fellow
i
hate
to
drink
water
but
i
guess
i
gotter
do
he
went
to
the
spring
sprawled
down
to
drink
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
thrust
his
arm
down
in
the
water
to
bring
forth
a
basket
the
cowboys
in
the
hurry
of
packing
had
neglected
to
remove
this
basket
and
it
contained
bottles
of
wine
and
liquors
for
madeline
guests
they
had
been
submerged
in
the
spring
to
keep
them
cold
the
guerrilla
fumbled
with
the
lid
opened
it
and
then
got
up
uttering
a
loud
roar
of
delight
stewart
made
an
almost
imperceptible
motion
as
if
to
leap
forward
but
he
checked
the
impulse
and
after
a
quick
glance
at
nels
he
said
to
the
guerrilla
guess
my
party
forgot
that
you
welcome
to
like
bees
the
guerrillas
swarmed
around
the
lucky
finder
of
the
bottles
there
was
a
babel
of
voices
the
drink
did
not
last
long
and
it
served
only
to
liberate
the
spirit
of
recklessness
the
several
white
outlaws
began
to
prowl
around
the
camp
some
of
the
mexicans
did
likewise
others
waited
showing
by
their
expectancy
the
nature
of
their
thoughts
it
was
the
demeanor
of
stewart
and
his
comrades
that
puzzled
madeline
apparently
they
felt
no
anxiety
or
even
particular
interest
don
carlos
who
had
been
covertly
watching
them
now
made
his
scrutiny
open
even
aggressive
he
looked
from
stewart
to
nels
and
monty
and
then
to
the
other
cowboys
while
some
of
his
men
prowled
around
the
others
watched
him
and
the
waiting
attitude
had
taken
on
something
sinister
the
guerrilla
leader
seemed
undecided
but
not
in
any
sense
puzzled
when
he
turned
his
cunning
face
upon
nels
and
monty
he
had
the
manner
of
a
man
in
whom
decision
was
lacking
in
her
growing
excitement
madeline
had
not
clearly
heard
ambrose
low
whispers
and
she
made
an
effort
to
distract
some
of
her
attention
from
those
below
to
the
cowboy
crouching
beside
her
the
quality
the
note
of
ambrose
whisper
had
changed
it
had
a
slight
sibilant
sound
do
be
mad
if
i
clap
my
hands
over
your
eyes
miss
hammond
he
was
saying
somethin
brewin
below
i
never
seen
gene
so
cool
that
a
dangerous
sign
in
him
and
look
see
how
the
boys
are
workin
together
oh
it
slow
and
but
i
know
it
sure
not
accident
that
foxy
greaser
knows
too
but
maybe
his
men
do
if
they
are
wise
they
have
sense
enough
to
care
the
don
though
worried
he
not
payin
so
much
attention
to
gene
either
it
nels
and
monty
he
watchin
and
well
he
need
do
it
there
nick
and
frank
have
settled
down
on
that
log
with
booly
they
do
seem
to
be
guns
but
look
how
heavy
their
vests
hang
a
gun
in
each
side
those
boys
can
pull
a
gun
and
flop
over
that
log
quicker
than
you
can
think
do
you
notice
how
nels
and
monty
and
gene
are
square
between
them
guerrillas
and
the
trail
up
here
it
does
seem
on
purpose
but
it
is
look
at
nels
and
monty
how
quiet
they
are
confabbin
together
no
attention
to
the
guerrillas
i
see
monty
look
at
gene
then
i
see
nels
look
at
gene
well
it
up
to
gene
and
they
goin
to
back
him
i
reckon
miss
hammond
there
be
dead
greasers
round
that
camp
long
ago
if
nels
and
monty
were
they
beholdin
to
gene
plain
and
lord
how
it
tickles
me
to
watch
them
both
packin
two
butts
swingin
clear
there
shots
in
them
four
guns
and
there
guerrillas
if
nels
and
monty
ever
throw
guns
at
that
close
range
why
before
you
know
what
was
up
there
be
a
pile
of
greasers
there
stewart
said
something
to
the
don
i
wonder
what
i
gamble
it
was
something
to
get
the
don
outfit
all
close
together
sure
greasers
have
no
sense
but
them
white
guerrillas
they
lookin
some
dubious
whatever
comin
off
will
come
soon
you
can
bet
i
wish
i
was
down
there
but
maybe
it
wo
come
to
a
scrap
stewart
set
on
avoidin
that
he
a
wonderful
chap
to
get
his
way
lord
though
i
like
to
see
him
go
after
that
overbearin
greaser
see
the
don
ca
stand
prosperity
all
this
strange
behavior
of
cowboys
is
beyond
his
brains
then
he
a
greaser
if
gene
does
knock
him
on
the
head
presently
he
begin
to
get
over
his
scare
even
of
nels
and
monty
but
gene
pick
out
the
right
time
and
i
gettin
nervous
i
want
somethin
to
start
never
saw
nels
in
but
one
fight
then
he
just
shot
a
greaser
arm
off
for
tryin
to
draw
on
him
but
i
heard
all
about
him
and
monty
monty
the
real
why
none
of
them
stories
them
lies
he
told
to
entertain
the
englishman
was
a
marker
to
what
monty
has
done
what
i
do
understand
is
how
monty
keeps
so
quiet
and
easy
and
that
not
his
way
with
such
an
outfit
lookin
for
trouble
now
for
the
grand
bluff
looks
like
no
fight
at
all
the
guerrilla
leader
had
ceased
his
restless
steps
and
glances
and
turned
to
stewart
with
something
of
bold
resolution
in
his
aspect
gracias
senor
he
said
he
swept
his
sombrero
in
the
direction
of
the
trail
leading
down
the
mountain
to
the
ranch
and
as
he
completed
the
gesture
a
smile
crafty
and
jeering
crossed
his
swarthy
face
ambrose
whispered
so
low
that
madeline
scarcely
heard
him
if
the
greaser
goes
that
way
he
find
our
horses
and
get
wise
to
the
trick
oh
he
wise
now
but
i
gamble
he
never
even
starts
on
that
neither
hurriedly
nor
guardedly
stewart
rose
out
of
his
leaning
posture
and
took
a
couple
of
long
strides
toward
don
carlos
go
back
the
way
you
came
he
fairly
yelled
and
his
voice
had
the
ring
of
a
bugle
ambrose
nudged
madeline
his
whisper
was
tense
and
rapid
do
miss
nothin
gene
called
him
whatever
comin
off
will
be
here
quick
as
lightnin
see
i
guess
maybe
that
greaser
do
savvy
good
lingo
look
at
that
dirty
yaller
face
turn
green
put
one
eye
on
nels
and
monty
that
great
just
to
see
just
as
quiet
and
easy
but
oh
the
difference
bent
and
stiff
that
means
every
muscle
is
like
a
rawhide
riata
they
watchin
with
eyes
that
can
see
the
workin
of
them
greasers
minds
now
there
ai
a
between
them
greasers
and
hell
don
carlos
gave
stewart
one
long
malignant
stare
then
he
threw
back
his
head
swept
up
the
sombrero
and
his
evil
smile
showed
gleaming
teeth
senor
he
began
with
magnificent
bound
stewart
was
upon
him
the
guerrilla
cry
was
throttled
in
his
throat
a
fierce
wrestling
ensued
too
swift
to
see
clearly
then
heavy
sodden
blows
and
don
carlos
was
beaten
to
the
ground
stewart
leaped
back
then
crouching
with
his
hands
on
the
butts
of
guns
at
his
hips
he
yelled
he
thundered
at
the
guerrillas
he
had
been
quicker
than
a
panther
and
now
his
voice
was
so
terrible
that
it
curdled
madeline
blood
and
the
menace
of
deadly
violence
in
his
crouching
position
made
her
shut
her
eyes
but
she
had
to
open
them
in
that
single
instant
nels
and
monty
had
leaped
to
stewart
side
both
were
bent
down
with
hands
on
the
butts
of
guns
at
their
hips
piercing
yell
seemed
to
divide
monty
roar
of
rage
then
they
ceased
and
echoes
clapped
from
the
crags
the
silence
of
those
three
men
crouching
like
tigers
about
to
leap
was
more
menacing
than
the
yells
then
the
guerrillas
wavered
and
broke
and
ran
for
their
horses
don
carlos
rolled
over
rose
and
staggered
away
to
be
helped
upon
his
mount
he
looked
back
his
pale
and
bloody
face
that
of
a
thwarted
demon
the
whole
band
got
into
action
and
were
gone
in
a
moment
i
knew
it
declared
ambrose
never
seen
a
greaser
who
could
face
that
was
some
warm
and
monty
price
never
flashed
a
gun
never
get
over
that
i
reckon
miss
harnmond
we
some
lucky
to
avoid
trouble
gene
had
his
way
as
you
seen
we
be
makin
tracks
for
the
ranch
in
about
two
why
whispered
madeline
breathlessly
she
became
conscious
that
she
was
weak
and
shaken
because
the
guerrillas
sure
will
get
their
nerve
back
and
come
sneakin
on
our
trail
or
try
to
head
us
off
by
ambushin
replied
ambrose
that
their
way
otherwise
three
cowboys
could
bluff
a
whole
gang
like
that
gene
knows
the
nature
of
greasers
but
i
reckon
we
in
more
danger
now
than
before
unless
we
get
a
good
start
down
the
mountain
there
gene
callin
come
hurry
helen
had
slipped
down
from
her
and
therefore
had
not
seen
the
last
act
in
that
little
drama
it
seemed
however
that
her
desire
for
excitement
was
satisfied
for
her
face
was
pale
and
she
trembled
when
she
asked
if
the
guerrillas
were
gone
i
did
see
the
finish
but
those
horrible
yells
were
enough
for
ambrose
hurried
the
three
women
over
the
rough
rocks
down
the
cliff
the
cowboys
below
were
saddling
horses
in
haste
evidently
all
the
horses
had
been
brought
out
of
hiding
swiftly
with
regard
only
for
life
and
limb
madeline
helen
and
christine
were
lowered
by
lassoes
and
half
carried
down
to
the
level
by
the
time
they
were
safely
down
the
other
members
of
the
party
appeared
on
the
cliff
above
they
were
in
excellent
spirits
appearing
to
treat
the
matter
as
a
huge
joke
ambrose
put
christine
on
a
horse
and
rode
away
through
the
pines
frankie
slade
did
likewise
with
helen
stewart
led
madeline
horse
up
to
her
helped
her
to
mount
and
spoke
one
stern
word
wait
then
as
fast
as
one
of
the
women
reached
the
level
she
was
put
upon
a
horse
and
taken
away
by
a
cowboy
escort
few
words
were
spoken
haste
seemed
to
be
the
great
essential
the
horses
were
urged
and
once
in
the
trail
spurred
and
led
into
a
swift
trot
one
cowboy
drove
up
four
and
these
were
hurriedly
loaded
with
the
party
baggage
castleton
and
his
companions
mounted
and
galloped
off
to
catch
the
others
in
the
lead
this
left
madeline
behind
with
stewart
and
nels
and
monty
they
goin
to
switch
off
at
the
holler
thet
heads
near
the
trail
a
few
miles
down
nels
was
saying
as
he
tightened
his
thet
holler
heads
into
a
big
canyon
once
in
thet
it
be
every
man
fer
hisself
i
reckon
there
wo
be
anythin
wuss
than
a
rough
nels
smiled
reassuringly
at
madeline
but
he
did
not
speak
to
her
monty
took
her
canteen
and
filled
it
at
the
spring
and
hung
it
over
the
pommel
of
her
saddle
he
put
a
couple
of
biscuits
in
the
do
fergit
to
take
a
drink
an
a
bite
as
you
ridin
along
he
said
an
do
worry
miss
majesty
stewart
be
with
you
an
me
nels
hangin
on
the
his
somber
and
sullen
face
did
not
change
in
its
strange
intensity
but
the
look
in
his
eyes
madeline
felt
she
would
never
forget
left
alone
with
these
three
men
now
stripped
of
all
pretense
she
realized
how
fortune
had
favored
her
and
what
peril
still
hung
in
the
balance
stewart
swung
astride
his
big
black
spurred
him
and
whistled
at
the
whistle
majesty
jumped
and
with
swift
canter
followed
stewart
madeline
looked
back
to
see
nels
already
up
and
monty
handing
him
a
rifle
then
the
pines
hid
her
view
once
in
the
trail
stewart
horse
broke
into
a
gallop
majesty
changed
his
gait
and
kept
at
the
black
heels
stewart
called
back
a
warning
the
low
branches
of
trees
might
brush
madeline
out
of
the
saddle
fast
riding
through
the
forest
along
a
crooked
obstructed
trail
called
forth
all
her
alertness
likewise
the
stirring
of
her
blood
always
susceptible
to
the
spirit
and
motion
of
a
ride
let
alone
one
of
peril
now
began
to
throb
and
burn
away
the
worry
the
dread
the
coldness
that
had
weighted
her
down
before
long
stewart
wheeled
at
right
angles
off
the
trail
and
entered
a
hollow
between
two
low
bluffs
madeline
saw
tracks
in
the
open
patches
of
ground
here
stewart
horse
took
to
a
brisk
walk
the
hollow
deepened
narrowed
became
rocky
full
of
logs
and
brush
madeline
exerted
all
her
keenness
and
needed
it
to
keep
close
to
stewart
she
did
not
think
of
him
nor
her
own
safety
but
of
keeping
majesty
close
in
the
tracks
of
the
black
of
eluding
the
sharp
spikes
in
the
dead
brush
of
avoiding
the
treacherous
loose
stones
at
last
madeline
was
brought
to
a
dead
halt
by
stewart
and
his
horse
blocking
the
trail
looking
up
she
saw
they
were
at
the
head
of
a
canyon
that
yawned
beneath
and
widened
its
slopes
down
to
a
black
forest
of
fir
the
drab
monotony
of
the
foothills
made
contrast
below
the
forest
and
away
in
the
distance
rosy
and
smoky
lay
the
desert
retracting
her
gaze
madeline
saw
cross
an
open
space
a
mile
below
and
she
thought
she
saw
the
stewart
dark
eyes
searched
the
slopes
high
up
along
the
craggy
escarpments
then
he
put
the
black
to
the
descent
if
there
had
been
a
trail
left
by
the
leading
cowboys
stewart
did
not
follow
it
he
led
off
to
the
right
zigzagging
an
intricate
course
through
the
roughest
ground
madeline
had
ever
ridden
over
he
crashed
through
cedars
threaded
a
tortuous
way
among
boulders
made
his
horse
slide
down
slanting
banks
of
soft
earth
picked
a
slow
and
cautious
progress
across
weathered
slopes
of
loose
rock
madeline
followed
finding
in
this
ride
a
tax
on
strength
and
judgment
on
an
ordinary
horse
she
never
could
have
kept
in
stewart
trail
it
was
dust
and
heat
a
parching
throat
that
caused
madeline
to
think
of
time
and
she
was
amazed
to
see
the
sun
sloping
to
the
west
stewart
never
stopped
he
never
looked
back
he
never
spoke
he
must
have
heard
the
horse
close
behind
him
madeline
remembered
monty
advice
about
drinking
and
eating
as
she
rode
along
the
worst
of
that
rough
travel
came
at
the
bottom
of
the
canyon
dead
cedars
and
brush
and
logs
were
easy
to
pass
compared
with
the
miles
it
seemed
of
loose
boulders
the
horses
slipped
and
stumbled
stewart
proceeded
here
with
exceeding
care
at
last
when
the
canyon
opened
into
a
level
forest
of
firs
the
sun
was
setting
red
in
the
west
stewart
quickened
the
gait
of
his
horse
after
a
mile
or
so
of
easy
travel
the
ground
again
began
to
fall
decidedly
sloping
in
numerous
ridges
with
draws
between
soon
night
shadowed
the
deeper
gullies
madeline
was
refreshed
by
the
cooling
of
the
air
stewart
traveled
slowly
now
the
barks
of
coyotes
seemed
to
startle
him
often
he
stopped
to
listen
and
during
one
of
those
intervals
the
silence
was
broken
by
sharp
madeline
could
not
tell
whether
they
were
near
or
far
to
right
or
left
behind
or
before
evidently
stewart
was
both
alarmed
and
baffled
he
dismounted
he
went
cautiously
forward
to
listen
madeline
fancied
she
heard
a
cry
low
and
far
away
it
was
only
that
of
a
coyote
she
convinced
herself
yet
it
was
so
wailing
so
human
that
she
shuddered
stewart
came
back
he
slipped
the
bridles
of
both
horses
and
he
led
them
every
few
paces
he
stopped
to
listen
he
changed
his
direction
several
times
and
the
last
time
he
got
among
rough
rocky
ridges
the
iron
shoes
of
the
horses
cracked
on
the
rocks
that
sound
must
have
penetrated
far
into
the
forest
it
perturbed
stewart
for
he
searched
for
softer
ground
meanwhile
the
shadows
merged
into
darkness
the
stars
shone
the
wind
rose
madeline
believed
hours
passed
stewart
halted
again
in
the
gloom
madeline
discerned
a
log
cabin
and
beyond
it
dark
trees
piercing
the
she
could
just
make
out
stewart
tall
form
as
he
leaned
against
his
horse
either
he
was
listening
or
debating
what
to
do
perhaps
both
presently
he
went
inside
the
cabin
madeline
heard
the
scratching
of
a
match
then
she
saw
a
faint
light
the
cabin
appeared
to
be
deserted
probably
it
was
one
of
the
many
habitations
belonging
to
prospectors
and
foresters
who
lived
in
the
mountains
stewart
came
out
again
he
walked
around
the
horses
out
into
the
gloom
then
back
to
madeline
for
a
long
moment
he
stood
as
still
as
a
statue
and
listened
then
she
heard
him
mutter
if
we
have
to
start
quick
i
can
ride
with
that
he
took
the
saddle
and
blanket
off
his
horse
and
carried
them
into
the
cabin
get
off
he
said
in
a
low
voice
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
door
he
helped
her
down
and
led
her
inside
where
again
he
struck
a
match
madeline
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
rude
fireplace
and
logs
stewart
blanket
and
saddle
lay
on
the
earthen
floor
rest
a
little
he
said
i
going
into
the
woods
a
piece
to
listen
gone
only
a
minute
or
madeline
had
to
feel
round
in
the
dark
to
locate
the
saddle
and
blanket
when
she
lay
down
it
was
with
a
grateful
sense
of
ease
and
relief
as
her
body
rested
however
her
mind
became
the
old
thronging
maze
for
sensation
and
thought
all
day
she
had
attended
to
the
alert
business
of
helping
her
horse
now
what
had
already
happened
the
night
the
silence
the
proximity
of
stewart
and
his
strange
stern
caution
the
possible
happenings
to
her
friends
all
claimed
their
due
share
of
her
feeling
she
went
over
them
all
with
lightning
swiftness
of
thought
she
believed
and
she
was
sure
stewart
believed
that
her
friends
owing
to
their
quicker
start
down
the
mountain
had
not
been
headed
off
in
their
travel
by
any
of
the
things
which
had
delayed
stewart
this
conviction
lifted
the
suddenly
returning
dread
from
her
breast
and
as
for
herself
somehow
she
had
no
fear
but
she
could
not
sleep
she
did
not
try
to
stewart
soft
steps
sounded
outside
his
dark
form
loomed
in
the
door
as
he
sat
down
madeline
heard
the
thump
of
a
gun
that
he
laid
beside
him
on
the
sill
then
the
thump
of
another
as
he
put
that
down
too
the
sounds
thrilled
her
stewart
wide
shoulders
filled
the
door
his
finely
shaped
head
and
strong
stern
profile
showed
clearly
in
outline
against
the
sky
the
wind
waved
his
hair
he
turned
his
ear
to
that
wind
and
listened
motionless
he
sat
for
what
to
her
seemed
hours
then
the
stirring
memory
of
the
day
adventure
the
feeling
of
the
beauty
of
the
night
and
a
strange
sweetly
vague
consciousness
of
happiness
portending
were
all
burned
out
in
hot
pressing
pain
at
the
remembrance
of
stewart
disgrace
in
her
eyes
something
had
changed
within
her
so
that
what
had
been
anger
at
herself
was
sorrow
for
him
he
was
such
a
splendid
man
she
could
not
feel
the
same
she
knew
her
debt
to
him
yet
she
could
not
thank
him
could
not
speak
to
him
she
fought
an
unintelligible
bitterness
then
she
rested
with
closed
eyes
and
time
seemed
neither
short
nor
long
when
stewart
called
her
she
opened
her
eyes
to
see
the
gray
of
dawn
she
rose
and
stepped
outside
the
horses
whinnied
in
a
moment
she
was
in
the
saddle
aware
of
cramped
muscles
and
a
weariness
of
limbs
stewart
led
off
at
a
sharp
trot
into
the
fir
forest
they
came
to
a
trail
into
which
he
turned
the
horses
traveled
steadily
the
descent
grew
less
steep
the
firs
thinned
out
the
gray
gloom
brightened
when
madeline
rode
out
of
the
firs
the
sun
had
arisen
and
the
foothills
rolled
beneath
her
and
at
their
edge
where
the
gray
of
valley
began
she
saw
a
dark
patch
that
she
knew
was
the
xx
the
sheriff
of
el
cajon
about
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
of
that
day
madeline
reached
the
ranch
her
guests
had
all
arrived
there
late
the
night
before
and
wanted
only
her
presence
and
the
assurance
of
her
to
consider
the
last
of
the
camping
trip
a
rare
adventure
likewise
they
voted
it
the
masterpiece
of
a
trick
madeline
delay
they
averred
had
been
only
a
clever
coup
to
give
a
final
effect
she
did
not
correct
their
impression
nor
think
it
needful
to
state
that
she
had
been
escorted
home
by
only
one
cowboy
her
guests
reported
an
arduous
ride
down
the
mountain
with
only
one
incident
to
lend
excitement
on
the
descent
they
had
fallen
in
with
sheriff
hawe
and
several
of
his
deputies
who
were
considerably
under
the
influence
of
drink
and
very
greatly
enraged
by
the
escape
of
the
mexican
girl
bonita
hawe
had
used
insulting
language
to
the
ladies
and
according
to
ambrose
would
have
inconvenienced
the
party
on
some
pretext
or
other
if
he
had
not
been
sharply
silenced
by
the
cowboys
madeline
guests
were
two
days
in
recovering
from
the
hard
ride
on
the
third
day
they
leisurely
began
to
prepare
for
departure
this
period
was
doubly
trying
for
madeline
she
had
her
own
physical
need
of
rest
and
moreover
had
to
face
a
mental
conflict
that
could
scarcely
be
postponed
further
her
sister
and
friends
were
kindly
and
earnestly
persistent
in
their
entreaties
that
she
go
back
east
with
them
she
desired
to
go
it
was
not
going
that
mattered
it
was
how
and
when
and
under
what
circumstances
she
was
to
return
that
roused
in
her
disturbing
emotion
before
she
went
east
she
wanted
to
have
fixed
in
mind
her
future
relation
to
the
ranch
and
the
west
when
the
crucial
hour
arrived
she
found
that
the
west
had
not
claimed
her
yet
these
old
friends
had
warmed
cold
ties
it
turned
out
however
that
there
need
be
no
hurry
about
making
the
decision
madeline
would
have
welcomed
any
excuse
to
procrastinate
but
as
it
happened
a
letter
from
alfred
made
her
departure
out
of
the
question
for
the
present
he
wrote
that
his
trip
to
california
had
been
very
profitable
that
he
had
a
proposition
for
madeline
from
a
large
cattle
company
and
particularly
that
he
wanted
to
marry
florence
soon
after
his
arrival
home
and
would
bring
a
minister
from
douglas
for
that
purpose
madeline
went
so
far
however
as
to
promise
helen
and
her
friends
that
she
would
go
east
soon
at
the
very
latest
by
thanksgiving
with
that
promise
they
were
reluctantly
content
to
say
to
the
ranch
and
to
her
at
the
last
moment
there
seemed
a
great
likelihood
of
a
hitch
in
plans
for
the
first
stage
of
that
homeward
journey
all
of
guests
held
up
their
hands
western
fashion
when
link
stevens
appeared
with
the
big
white
car
link
protested
innocently
solemnly
that
he
would
drive
slowly
and
safely
but
it
was
necessary
for
madeline
to
guarantee
link
word
and
to
accompany
them
before
they
would
enter
the
car
at
the
station
were
spoken
and
repeated
and
promise
was
exacted
for
the
hundredth
time
dorothy
coombs
last
words
were
give
my
love
to
monty
price
tell
him
i
i
glad
he
kissed
me
helen
eyes
had
a
sweet
grave
yet
mocking
light
as
she
said
majesty
bring
stewart
with
you
when
you
come
he
be
the
madeline
treated
the
remark
with
the
same
merry
lightness
with
which
it
was
received
by
the
others
but
after
the
train
had
pulled
out
and
she
was
on
her
way
home
she
remembered
helen
words
and
looks
with
something
almost
amounting
to
a
shock
any
mention
of
stewart
any
thought
of
him
displeased
her
what
did
helen
mean
mused
madeline
and
she
pondered
that
mocking
light
in
helen
eyes
had
been
simply
an
ironical
glint
a
cynical
gleam
from
that
worldly
experience
so
suspicious
and
tolerant
in
its
wisdom
the
sweet
gravity
of
helen
look
had
been
a
deeper
and
more
subtle
thing
madeline
wanted
to
understand
it
to
divine
in
it
a
new
relation
between
helen
and
herself
something
fine
and
sisterly
that
might
lead
to
love
the
thought
however
revolving
around
a
strange
suggestion
of
stewart
was
poisoned
at
its
inception
and
she
dismissed
it
upon
the
drive
in
to
the
ranch
as
she
was
passing
the
lower
lake
she
saw
stewart
walking
listlessly
along
the
shore
when
he
became
aware
of
the
approach
of
the
car
he
suddenly
awakened
from
his
aimless
sauntering
and
disappeared
quickly
in
the
shade
of
the
shrubbery
this
was
not
by
any
means
the
first
time
madeline
had
seen
him
avoid
a
possible
meeting
with
her
somehow
the
act
had
pained
her
though
affording
her
a
relief
she
did
not
want
to
meet
him
face
to
face
it
was
annoying
for
her
to
guess
that
stillwell
had
something
to
say
in
stewart
defense
the
old
cattleman
was
evidently
distressed
several
times
he
had
tried
to
open
a
conversation
with
madeline
relating
to
stewart
she
had
evaded
him
until
the
last
time
when
his
persistence
had
brought
a
cold
and
final
refusal
to
hear
another
word
about
the
foreman
stillwell
had
been
crushed
as
days
passed
stewart
remained
at
the
ranch
without
his
old
faithfulness
to
his
work
madeline
was
not
moved
to
a
kinder
frame
of
mind
to
see
him
wandering
dejectedly
around
it
hurt
her
and
because
it
hurt
her
she
grew
all
the
harder
then
she
could
not
help
hearing
snatches
of
conversation
which
strengthened
her
suspicions
that
stewart
was
losing
his
grip
on
himself
that
he
would
soon
take
the
downward
course
again
verification
of
her
own
suspicion
made
it
a
belief
and
belief
brought
about
a
sharp
conflict
between
her
generosity
and
some
feeling
that
she
could
not
name
it
was
not
a
question
of
justice
or
mercy
or
sympathy
if
a
single
word
could
have
saved
stewart
from
sinking
his
splendid
manhood
into
the
brute
she
had
recoiled
from
at
chiricahua
she
would
not
have
spoken
it
she
could
not
restore
him
to
his
former
place
in
her
regard
she
really
did
not
want
him
at
the
ranch
at
all
once
considering
in
wonder
her
knowledge
of
men
she
interrogated
herself
to
see
just
why
she
could
not
overlook
transgression
she
never
wanted
to
speak
to
him
again
or
see
him
or
think
of
him
in
some
way
through
her
interest
in
stewart
she
had
come
to
feel
for
herself
an
inexplicable
thing
close
to
scorn
a
telegram
from
douglas
heralding
the
coming
of
alfred
and
a
minister
put
an
end
to
madeline
brooding
and
she
shared
something
of
florence
kingsley
excitement
the
cowboys
were
as
eager
and
gossipy
as
girls
it
was
arranged
to
have
the
wedding
ceremony
performed
in
great
and
the
dinner
in
the
cool
patio
alfred
and
his
minister
arrived
at
the
ranch
in
the
big
white
car
they
appeared
considerably
in
fact
the
minister
was
breathless
almost
sightless
and
certainly
hatless
alfred
used
as
he
was
to
wind
and
speed
remarked
that
he
did
not
wonder
at
nels
aversion
to
riding
a
fleeting
the
imperturbable
link
took
off
his
cap
and
goggles
and
consulting
his
watch
made
his
usual
apologetic
report
to
madeline
deploring
the
fact
that
a
teamster
and
a
few
stray
cattle
on
the
road
had
held
him
down
to
the
manana
time
of
only
a
mile
a
minute
arrangements
for
the
wedding
brought
alfred
delighted
approval
when
he
had
learned
all
florence
and
madeline
would
tell
him
he
expressed
a
desire
to
have
the
cowboys
attend
and
then
he
went
on
to
talk
about
california
where
he
was
going
take
florence
on
a
short
trip
he
was
curiously
interested
to
find
out
all
about
madeline
guests
and
what
had
happened
to
them
his
keen
glance
at
madeline
grew
softer
as
she
talked
i
breathe
again
he
said
and
laughed
i
was
afraid
well
i
must
have
missed
some
sport
i
can
just
fancy
what
monty
and
nels
did
to
that
englishman
so
you
went
up
to
the
crags
that
a
wild
place
i
not
surprised
at
guerrillas
falling
in
with
you
up
there
the
crags
were
a
famous
rendezvous
for
apaches
it
near
the
border
almost
inaccessible
good
water
and
grass
i
wonder
what
the
cavalry
would
think
if
they
knew
these
guerrillas
crossed
the
border
right
under
their
noses
well
it
practically
impossible
to
patrol
some
of
that
it
desert
mountain
and
canyon
exceedingly
wild
and
broken
i
sorry
to
say
that
there
seems
to
be
more
trouble
in
sight
with
these
guerrillas
than
at
any
time
heretofore
orozco
the
rebel
leader
has
failed
to
withstand
madero
army
the
federals
are
occupying
chihuahua
now
and
are
driving
the
rebels
north
orozco
has
broken
up
his
army
into
guerrilla
bands
they
are
moving
north
and
west
intending
to
carry
on
guerrilla
warfare
in
sonora
i
ca
say
just
how
this
will
affect
us
here
but
we
too
close
to
the
border
for
comfort
these
guerrillas
are
hawks
they
can
cross
the
border
raid
us
here
and
get
back
the
same
night
fighting
i
imagine
will
not
be
restricted
to
northern
mexico
with
the
revolution
a
failure
the
guerrillas
will
be
more
numerous
bolder
and
hungrier
unfortunately
we
happen
to
be
favorably
situated
for
them
down
here
in
this
wilderness
corner
of
the
on
the
following
day
alfred
and
florence
were
married
sister
and
several
friends
from
el
cajon
were
present
besides
madeline
stillwell
and
his
men
it
was
alfred
express
wish
that
stewart
attend
the
ceremony
madeline
was
amused
when
she
noticed
the
painfully
suppressed
excitement
of
the
cowboys
for
them
a
wedding
must
have
been
an
unusual
and
impressive
event
she
began
to
have
a
better
understanding
of
the
nature
of
it
when
they
cast
off
restraint
and
pressed
forward
to
kiss
the
bride
in
all
her
life
madeline
had
never
seen
a
bride
kissed
so
much
and
so
heartily
nor
one
so
flushed
and
disheveled
and
happy
this
indeed
was
a
joyful
occasion
there
was
nothing
of
the
effete
east
about
alfred
hammond
he
might
have
been
a
westerner
all
his
days
when
madeline
managed
to
get
through
the
press
of
cowboys
to
offer
her
congratulations
alfred
gave
her
a
bear
hug
and
a
kiss
this
appeared
to
fascinate
the
cowboys
with
shining
eyes
and
faces
aglow
with
smiling
boyish
boldness
they
made
a
rush
at
madeline
for
one
instant
her
heart
leaped
to
her
throat
they
looked
as
if
they
could
most
shamelessly
kiss
and
maul
her
that
little
rude
ruffian
monty
price
was
in
the
lead
he
resembled
a
dragon
actuated
by
sentiment
all
at
once
madeline
instinctive
antagonism
to
being
touched
by
strange
hands
or
lips
battled
with
a
real
warm
and
desire
to
let
the
cowboys
work
their
will
with
her
but
she
saw
stewart
hanging
at
the
back
of
the
crowd
and
something
some
fierce
dark
expression
of
pain
amazed
her
while
it
froze
her
desire
to
be
kind
then
she
did
not
know
what
change
must
have
come
to
her
face
and
bearing
but
she
saw
monty
fall
back
sheepishly
and
the
other
cowboys
draw
aside
to
let
her
lead
the
way
into
the
patio
the
dinner
began
quietly
enough
with
the
cowboys
divided
between
embarrassment
and
voracious
appetites
that
they
evidently
feared
to
indulge
wine
however
loosened
their
tongues
and
when
stillwell
got
up
to
make
the
speech
everybody
seemed
to
expect
of
him
they
greeted
him
with
a
roar
stillwell
was
now
one
huge
mountainous
smile
he
was
so
happy
that
he
appeared
on
the
verge
of
tears
he
rambled
on
ecstatically
till
he
came
to
raise
his
glass
an
now
girls
an
boys
let
all
drink
to
the
bride
an
groom

their
sincere
an
lastin
love

their

friends
a
heavy
pound
of
horses
hoofs
and
a
yell
outside
arrested
voice
and
halted
his
hand
in
midair
the
patio
became
as
silent
as
an
unoccupied
room
through
the
open
doors
and
windows
of
madeline
chamber
burst
the
sounds
of
horses
stamping
to
a
halt
then
harsh
speech
of
men
and
a
low
cry
of
a
woman
in
pain
rapid
steps
crossed
the
porch
entered
madeline
room
nels
appeared
in
the
doorway
madeline
was
surprised
to
see
that
he
had
not
been
at
the
she
was
disturbed
at
sight
of
his
face
stewart
you
wanted
outdoors
called
nels
bluntly
monty
you
slope
out
here
with
me
you
nick
an
stillwell
i
reckon
the
rest
of
you
hed
better
shut
the
doors
an
stay
nels
disappeared
quick
as
a
cat
monty
glided
out
madeline
heard
his
soft
swift
steps
pass
from
her
room
into
her
office
he
had
left
his
guns
there
madeline
trembled
she
saw
stewart
get
up
quietly
and
without
any
change
of
expression
on
his
dark
sad
face
leave
the
patio
nick
steele
followed
him
stillwell
dropped
his
as
it
broke
shivering
the
silence
his
huge
smile
vanished
his
face
set
into
the
old
cragginess
and
the
red
slowly
thickened
into
black
stillwell
went
out
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
then
there
was
a
blank
silence
the
enjoyment
of
the
moment
had
been
rudely
disrupted
madeline
glanced
down
the
lines
of
brown
faces
to
see
the
pleasure
fade
into
the
old
familiar
hardness
what
wrong
asked
alfred
rather
stupidly
the
change
of
mood
had
been
too
rapid
for
him
suddenly
he
awakened
thoroughly
aroused
at
the
interruption
i
going
to
see
who
butted
in
here
to
spoil
our
dinner
he
said
and
strode
out
he
returned
before
any
one
at
the
table
had
spoken
or
moved
and
now
the
dull
red
of
anger
mottled
his
forehead
it
the
sheriff
of
el
cajon
he
exclaimed
contemptuously
pat
hawe
with
some
of
his
tough
deputies
come
to
arrest
gene
stewart
they
got
that
poor
little
mexican
girl
out
there
tied
on
a
horse
confound
that
sheriff
madeline
calmly
rose
from
the
table
eluding
florence
entreating
hand
and
started
for
the
door
the
cowboys
jumped
up
alfred
barred
her
progress
alfred
i
am
going
out
she
said
no
i
guess
not
he
replied
that
no
place
for
i
am
she
looked
straight
at
him
madeline
why
what
is
it
you
look
dear
there
pretty
sure
to
be
trouble
outside
maybe
there
be
a
fight
you
can
do
nothing
you
must
not
perhaps
i
can
prevent
trouble
she
replied
as
she
left
the
patio
she
was
aware
that
alfred
with
florence
at
his
side
and
the
cowboys
behind
were
starting
to
follow
her
when
she
got
out
of
her
room
upon
the
porch
she
heard
several
men
in
loud
angry
discussion
then
at
sight
of
bonita
helplessly
and
cruelly
bound
upon
a
horse
pale
and
disheveled
and
suffering
madeline
experienced
the
thrill
that
sight
or
mention
of
this
girl
always
gave
her
it
yielded
to
a
hot
pang
in
her
breast
that
live
pain
which
so
shamed
her
but
almost
instantly
as
a
second
glance
showed
an
agony
in
bonita
face
her
bruised
arms
where
the
rope
bit
deep
into
the
flesh
her
little
brown
hands
stained
with
blood
madeline
was
overcome
by
pity
for
the
unfortunate
girl
and
a
woman
righteous
passion
at
such
barbarous
treatment
of
one
of
her
own
sex
the
man
holding
the
bridle
of
the
horse
on
which
bonita
had
been
bound
was
at
once
recognized
by
madeline
as
the
guerrilla
who
had
found
the
basket
of
wine
in
the
spring
at
camp
redder
of
face
blacker
of
beard
coarser
of
aspect
evidently
under
the
influence
of
liquor
he
was
as
as
a
gorilla
and
as
repulsive
besides
him
there
were
three
other
men
present
all
mounted
on
weary
horses
the
one
in
the
foreground
gaunt
with
a
pointed
beard
she
recognized
as
the
sheriff
of
el
cajon
madeline
hesitated
then
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
porch
alfred
florence
and
several
others
followed
her
out
the
rest
of
the
cowboys
and
guests
crowded
the
windows
and
doors
stillwell
saw
madeline
and
throwing
up
his
hands
roared
to
be

quieted
the
gesticulating
quarreling

his
face
turned
purple
what
criminal
he
shouted
hoarsely
the
sheriff
flicked
his
quirt
against
his
dirty
boot
and
he
twisted
his
thin
lips
into
a
leer
the
situation
was
agreeable
to
him

way
to
proceed
with

law
mebbe

took
one
mighty
stride
off
the
porch
his
last
words
had
been
cold
his
rage
appeared
to
have
been
transferred
to
hawe
the
sheriff
had
begun
to
stutter
and
shake
a
lanky
red
hand
at
the
cattleman
when

stepped
out

the
mexican
girl
suddenly
seemed
vitalized
out
of
her
stupor
she
strained
at
her
bonds
as
if
to
lift
her
hands
beseechingly
a
flush
animated
her
haggard
face
and
her
big
dark

felt
something
tense
and
strained
working
in
the
short
silence
was
it
only
a
phase
of
her
thrilling
excitement
her
swift
glance
showed
the
faces
of
nels
and
monty
and
nick
to
be
brooding
cold
watchful
she
wondered
why
stewart
did
not
look
toward
bonita
he
too
was
now
cool
quiet
with
something
ominous
about
him

madeline
thought
she
saw
stewart
give
a
slight
start
but
an
unaccountable
dimness
came
over
her
eyes
at
brief
intervals
obscuring
her
keen
sight
vaguely
she
was
conscious
of
a
clogged
and
beating
tumult
in
her
breast

stewart

a
kind
of

he
pleaded

the

kindly
old
rancher

looked
harder
than

how
about
my
feelin
i
want
to
know
if

stewart
steadily
wal

no
i
go
thanks
bill
for
the
way
you
and
the
boys
would
stick
to
me
hurry
hawe
before
my
mind
his
voice
broke
at
the
last
betraying
the
wonderful
control
he
had
kept
over
his
passions
as
he
ceased
speaking
he
seemed
suddenly
to
become
spiritless
he
dropped
his
head
madeline
saw
in
him
then
a
semblance
to
the
hopeless
shamed
stewart
of
earlier
days
the
vague
riot
in
her
breast
leaped
into
conscious
fury
a
woman
passionate
repudiation
of
stewart
broken
spirit
it
was
not
that
she
would
have
him
be
a
lawbreaker
it
was
that
she
could
not
bear
to
see
him
deny
his
manhood
once
she
had
entreated
him
to
become
her
kind
of
a
cowboy
a
man
in
whom
reason
tempered
passion
she
had
let
him
see
how
painful
and
shocking
any
violence
was
to
her
and
the
idea
had
obsessed
him
softened
him
had
grown
like
a
stultifying
lichen
upon
his
will
had
shorn
him
of
a
wild
bold
spirit
she
now
strangely
longed
to
see
him
feel
when
the
man
sneed
came
forward
jingling
the
iron
fetters
madeline
blood
turned
to
fire
she
would
have
forgiven
stewart
then
for
lapsing
into
the
kind
of
cowboy
it
had
been
her
blind
and
sickly
sentiment
to
abhor
this
was
a
man
west
a
man
game
what
right
had
a
woman
reared
in
a
softer
mold
to
use
her
beauty
and
her
influence
to
change
a
man
who
was
bold
and
free
and
strong
at
that
moment
with
her
blood
hot
and
racing
she
would
have
gloried
in
the
violence
which
she
had
so
deplored
she
would
have
welcomed
the
action
that
had
characterized
stewart
treatment
of
don
carlos
she
had
in
her
the
sudden
dawning
temper
of
a
woman
who
had
been
assimilating
the
life
and
nature
around
her
and
who
would
not
have
turned
her
eyes
away
from
a
harsh
and
bloody
deed
but
stewart
held
forth
his
hands
to
be
manacled
then
madeline
heard
her
own
voice
burst
out
in
a
ringing
imperious
wait
in
the
time
it
took
her
to
make
the
few
steps
to
the
edge
of
the
porch
facing
the
men
she
not
only
felt
her
anger
and
justice
and
pride
summoning
forces
to
her
command
but
there
was
something
else
calling
a
deep
passionate
mysterious
thing
not
born
of
the
moment
sneed
dropped
the
manacles
stewart
face
took
on
a
chalky
whiteness
hawe
in
a
slow
stupid
embarrassment
beyond
his
control
removed
his
sombrero
in
a
respect
that
seemed
wrenched
from
him
mr
hawe
i
can
prove
to
you
that
stewart
was
not
concerned
in
any
way
whatever
with
the
crime
for
which
you
want
to
arrest
the
sheriff
stare
underwent
a
blinking
change
he
coughed
stammered
and
tried
to
speak
manifestly
he
had
been
thrown
completely
off
his
balance
astonishment
slowly
merged
into
discomfiture
it
was
absolutely
impossible
for
stewart
to
have
been
connected
with
that
assault
went
on
madeline
swiftly
for
he
was
with
me
in
the
of
the
station
at
the
moment
the
assault
was
made
outside
i
assure
you
i
have
a
distinct
and
vivid
recollection
the
door
was
open
i
heard
the
voices
of
quarreling
men
they
grew
louder
the
language
was
spanish
evidently
these
men
had
left
the
opposite
and
were
approaching
the
station
i
heard
a
woman
voice
mingling
with
the
others
it
too
was
spanish
and
i
could
not
understand
but
the
tone
was
beseeching
then
i
heard
footsteps
on
the
gravel
i
knew
stewart
heard
them
i
could
see
from
his
face
that
something
dreadful
was
about
to
happen
just
outside
the
door
then
there
were
hoarse
furious
voices
a
scuffle
a
muffled
shot
a
woman
cry
the
thud
of
a
falling
body
and
rapid
footsteps
of
a
man
running
away
next
the
girl
bonita
staggered
into
the
door
she
was
white
trembling
she
recognized
stewart
appealed
to
him
stewart
supported
her
and
endeavored
to
calm
her
he
was
excited
he
asked
her
if
danny
mains
had
been
shot
or
if
he
had
done
the
shooting
the
girl
said
no
she
told
stewart
that
she
had
danced
a
little
flirted
a
little
with
vaqueros
and
they
had
quarreled
over
her
then
stewart
took
her
outside
and
put
her
upon
his
horse
i
saw
the
girl
ride
that
horse
down
the
street
to
disappear
in
the
while
madeline
spoke
another
change
appeared
to
be
working
in
the
man
hawe
he
was
not
long
disconcerted
but
his
discomfiture
wore
to
a
sullen
fury
and
his
sharp
features
fixed
in
an
expression
of
craft
thet
mighty
interestin
miss
hammond
as
interestin
as
a
he
said
now
since
you
so
obligin
a
witness
i
sure
like
to
put
a
question
or
two
what
time
did
you
arrive
at
el
cajon
thet
night
it
was
after
eleven
replied
madeline
nobody
there
to
meet
you
the
station
agent
an
operator
both
gone
wal
how
soon
did
this
feller
stewart
show
up
hawe
continued
with
a
wry
smile
very
soon
after
my
arrival
i
think
perhaps
fifteen
minutes
possibly
a
little
some
dark
an
lonesome
around
thet
station
was
it
indeed
an
what
time
was
the
greaser
shot
queried
hawe
with
his
little
eyes
gleaming
like
coals
probably
close
to
half
past
one
it
was
two
when
i
looked
at
my
watch
at
florence
kingsley
house
directly
after
stewart
sent
bonita
away
he
took
me
to
miss
kingsley
so
allowing
for
the
walk
and
a
few
minutes
conversation
with
her
i
can
pretty
definitely
say
the
shooting
took
place
at
about
half
past
stillwell
heaved
his
big
frame
a
step
closer
to
the
sheriff
what
you
drivin
at
he
roared
his
face
black
again
evidence
snapped
hawe
madeline
marveled
at
this
interruption
and
as
stewart
irresistibly
drew
her
glance
she
saw
him
as
ashes
shaking
utterly
unnerved
i
thank
you
miss
hammond
he
said
huskily
but
you
need
answer
any
more
of
hawe
questions
he
he
it
not
necessary
i
go
with
him
now
under
arrest
bonita
will
corroborate
your
testimony
in
court
and
that
will
save
me
from
this
this
man
madeline
looking
at
stewart
seeing
a
humility
she
at
first
took
for
cowardice
suddenly
divined
that
it
was
not
fear
for
himself
which
made
him
dread
further
disclosures
of
that
night
but
fear
for
her
fear
of
shame
she
might
suffer
through
him
pat
hawe
cocked
his
head
to
one
side
like
a
vulture
about
to
strike
with
his
beak
and
cunningly
eyed
madeline
considered
as
testimony
what
you
said
is
sure
important
conclusive
but
i
calculatin
thet
the
court
will
want
to
hev
explained
why
you
stayed
from
till
in
thet
alone
with
his
deliberate
speech
met
with
what
madeline
imagined
a
remarkable
reception
from
stewart
who
gave
a
tigerish
start
from
stillwell
whose
big
hands
tore
at
the
neck
of
his
shirt
as
if
he
was
choking
from
alfred
who
now
strode
hotly
forward
to
be
stopped
by
the
cold
and
silent
nels
from
monty
price
who
uttered
a
violent
aw
which
was
both
a
hiss
and
a
roar
in
the
rush
of
her
thought
madeline
could
not
interpret
the
meaning
of
these
things
which
seemed
so
strange
at
that
moment
but
they
were
portentous
even
as
she
was
forming
a
reply
to
hawe
speech
she
felt
a
chill
creep
over
her
stewart
detained
me
in
the
she
said
as
a
bell
but
we
were
not
alone
all
the
for
a
moment
the
only
sound
following
her
words
was
a
gasp
from
stewart
hawe
face
became
transformed
with
a
hideous
amaze
and
joy
detained
he
whispered
craning
his
lean
and
corded
neck
thet
stewart
was
drunk
he
with
sudden
passionate
gesture
of
despair
stewart
appealed
to
her
oh
miss
hammond
do
do
do
then
he
seemed
to
sink
down
head
lowered
upon
his
breast
in
utter
shame
stillwell
great
hand
swept
to
the
bowed
shoulder
and
he
turned
to
madeline
miss
majesty
i
reckon
you
be
wise
to
tell
all
said
the
old
cattleman
gravely
there
ai
one
of
us
who
could
misunderstand
any
motive
or
act
of
yours
mebbe
a
stroke
of
lightnin
might
clear
this
murky
air
whatever
gene
stewart
did
that
onlucky
night
you
tell
madeline
dignity
and
had
been
disturbed
by
importunity
she
broke
into
swift
disconnected
speech
he
came
into
the
station
a
few
minutes
after
i
got
there
i
be
shown
to
a
hotel
he
said
there
was
any
that
would
accommodate
married
women
he
grasped
my
hand
looked
for
a
then
i
saw
he
was
he
was
intoxicated
he
told
me
he
would
go
for
a
hotel
porter
but
he
came
back
with
a
padre
padre
marcos
the
poor
priest
was
terribly
frightened
so
was
stewart
had
turned
into
a
devil
he
fired
his
gun
at
the
padre
feet
he
pushed
me
into
a
bench
again
he
shot
right
before
my
face
i
i
nearly
fainted
but
i
heard
him
cursing
the
padre
heard
the
padre
praying
or
chanting
i
did
know
what
stewart
tried
to
make
me
say
things
in
spanish
all
at
once
he
asked
my
name
i
told
him
he
jerked
at
my
veil
i
took
it
off
then
he
threw
his
gun
down
pushed
the
padre
out
of
the
door
that
was
just
before
the
vaqueros
approached
with
bonita
padre
marcos
must
have
seen
them
must
have
heard
them
after
that
stewart
grew
quickly
sober
he
was
mortified
distressed
stricken
with
shame
he
told
me
he
had
been
drinking
at
a
wedding
i
remember
it
was
ed
linton
wedding
then
he
explained
the
boys
were
always
gambling
he
wagered
he
would
marry
the
first
girl
who
arrived
at
el
cajon
i
happened
to
be
the
first
one
he
tried
to
force
me
to
marry
him
the
rest
relating
to
the
assault
on
the
vaquero
i
have
already
told
madeline
ended
out
of
breath
and
panting
with
her
hands
pressed
upon
her
heaving
bosom
revelation
of
that
secret
liberated
emotion
those
hurried
outspoken
words
had
made
her
throb
and
tremble
and
burn
strangely
then
she
thought
of
alfred
and
his
wrath
but
he
stood
motionless
as
if
dazed
stillwell
was
trying
to
holster
up
the
crushed
stewart
hawe
rolled
his
red
eyes
and
threw
back
his
head
ho

ho
ho
ho

any
of
it

born
days

then
he
ceased
laughing
and
with
glinting
gaze
upon
madeline
insolent
and
vicious
and
savage
he
began
to
drawl
wal
now
my
lady
i
reckon
your
story
if
it
tallies
with
bonita
padre
marcos
will
clear
gene
stewart
in
the
eyes
of
the
here
he
grew
slower
more
biting
sharper
and
harder
of
face
but
you
need
expect

or
the
court
to
swaller
thet
part
of
your
story
about

detained
unwillin
madeline
had
not
time
to
grasp
the
sense
of
his
last
words
stewart
had
convulsively
sprung
upward
white
as
chalk
as
he
leaped
at
hawe
stillwell
interposed
his
huge
bulk
and
wrapped
his
arms
around
stewart
there
was
a
brief
whirling
wrestling
struggle
stewart
appeared
to
be
besting
the
old
cattleman
help

yelled
stillwell
i
ca
hold

or

goin
to

and
several
cowboys
leaped
to
stillwell
assistance
stewart
getting
free
tossed
one
aside
and
then
another
they
closed
in
on
him
for
an
instant
a
furious
straining
wrestle
of
powerful
bodies
made
rasp
and
shock
and
blow
once
stewart
heaved
them
from
him
but
they
plunged
back
upon
him

transfixed
by
a
terrible
sound
her
startled
glance
shifted
from
the
anxious
group
round
stewart
to
see
that
monty
price
had
leaped
off
the
porch
he
crouched
down
with
his
bands
below
his
hips
where
the
big
guns
swung
from
his
distorted
lips
issued
that
which
was
combined
roar
and
bellow
and
indian
and
more
than
all
a
horrible
warning
cry
he
resembled
a
hunchback
about
to

the
leap
of
a
demon

was

to

them
farther
his
motions
were
rapid
and
stern
but
failing
to
get
them
through

and
windows
he
planted
his
wide
person
between
the
women
and

on
and
peered
fearfully
from
behind
his

made
a
long
pause
in
which
his
breathing
was

were
riveted
upon

after
many
months
about

she
had

this
little
terrible
monty

now
rose
as
it
were
out
of
his
past
wild
years
and
no
power
on
earth
or
in
heaven
could
stay
his
hand
it
was
the
hard
life
of
wild
men
in
a
wild
country
that
was
about
to
strike
this
blow
at
her
she
did
not
shudder
she
did
not
wish
to
blot
out
from
sight
this
little
man
terrible
in
his
mood
of
wild
justice
she
suffered
a
flash
of
horror
that
monty
blind
and
dead
to
her
authority
cold
as
steel
toward
her

understood
the
deeps
of

moment
of
strife
of
insult
to
her
of
torture
to
the
man
she
had
uplifted
and
then
broken
the
passion
of
her
reached
deep
toward
primitive
hate
with
eyes
slowly
hazing

watched

listened
with
thrumming

crouched

at

and
he
edged
inch
by
inch
farther
out
from
the
porch
closer
to
hawe
and
sneed
madeline
saw
them
only
in
the
blurred
fringe
of
her
sight
they
resembled
specters
she
heard
the
shrill
whistle
of
a
horse
and
recognized
majesty
calling
her
from
the
corral
thet
all
roared

in

his
breath
came
quicker
his
voice
grew
hoarser
and
he
crouched

his
body
except
his
rigid
arms
quivered
with
a
wonderful
muscular
convulsion
dogs

aha
to
madeline
it
seemed
the
three
stiff
crouching
men
leaped
into
instant
and
united
action
she
saw
streaks
of
fire
streaks
of
smoke
then
a
crashing
volley
deafened
her
it
ceased
as
quickly
smoke
veiled
the
scene
slowly
it
drifted
away
to
disclose
three
fallen
men
one
of
whom
monty
leaned
on
his
left
hand
a
smoking
gun
in
his
right
he
watched
for
a
movement
from
the
other
two
it
did
not
come
then
with
a
terrible
smile
he
slid
back
and
stretched
out
xxi
unbridled
in
waking
and
sleeping
hours
madeline
hammond
could
not
release
herself
from
the
thralling
memory
of
that
tragedy
she
was
haunted
by
monty
price
terrible
smile
only
in
action
of
some
kind
could
she
escape
and
to
that
end
she
worked
she
walked
and
rode
she
even
overcame
a
strong
feeling
which
she
feared
was
unreasonable
disgust
for
the
mexican
girl
bonita
who
lay
ill
at
the
ranch
bruised
and
feverish
in
need
of
skilful
nursing
madeline
felt
there
was
something
inscrutable
changing
her
soul
that
strife
the
struggle
to
decide
her
destiny
for
east
or
west
held
still
further
aloof
she
was
never
spiritually
alone
there
was
a
step
on
her
trail
indoors
she
was
oppressed
she
required
the
open
the
light
and
wind
the
sight
of
endless
slope
the
sounds
of
corral
and
pond
and
field
physical
things
natural
things
one
afternoon
she
rode
down
to
the
round
them
and
back
up
to
the
spillway
of
the
lower
lake
where
a
group
of
owing
to
the
water
that
seeped
through
the
sand
to
their
roots
had
taken
on
bloom
and
beauty
of
renewed
life
under
these
trees
there
was
shade
enough
to
make
a
pleasant
place
to
linger
madeline
dismounted
desiring
to
rest
a
little
she
liked
this
quiet
lonely
spot
it
was
really
the
only
secluded
nook
near
the
house
if
she
rode
down
into
the
valley
or
out
to
the
mesa
or
up
on
the
foothills
she
could
not
go
alone
probably
now
stillwell
or
nels
knew
her
whereabouts
but
as
she
was
comparatively
hidden
here
she
imagined
a
solitude
that
was
not
actually
hers
her
horse
majesty
tossed
his
head
and
flung
his
mane
and
switched
his
tail
at
the
flies
he
would
rather
have
been
cutting
the
wind
down
the
valley
slope
madeline
sat
with
her
back
against
a
tree
and
took
off
her
sombrero
the
soft
breeze
fanning
her
hot
face
blowing
strands
of
her
hair
was
refreshingly
cool
she
heard
the
slow
tramp
of
cattle
going
in
to
drink
that
sound
ceased
and
the
grove
of
mesquites
appeared
to
be
lifeless
except
for
her
and
her
horse
it
was
however
only
after
moments
of
attention
that
she
found
the
place
was
far
from
being
dead
keen
eyes
and
ears
brought
reward
desert
quail
as
gray
as
the
bare
earth
were
dusting
themselves
in
a
shady
spot
a
bee
swift
as
light
hummed
by
she
saw
a
horned
toad
the
color
of
stone
squatting
low
hiding
fearfully
in
the
sand
within
reach
of
her
whip
she
extended
the
point
of
the
whip
and
the
toad
quivered
and
swelled
and
hissed
it
was
instinct
with
fight
the
wind
faintly
stirred
the
thin
foliage
of
the
mesquites
making
a
mournful
sigh
from
far
up
in
the
foothills
barely
distinguishable
came
the
scream
of
an
eagle
the
bray
of
a
burro
brought
a
brief
discordant
break
then
a
brown
bird
darted
down
from
an
unseen
perch
and
made
a
swift
irregular
flight
after
a
fluttering
winged
insect
madeline
heard
the
sharp
snapping
of
a
merciless
beak
indeed
there
was
more
than
life
in
the
shade
of
the
mesquites
suddenly
majesty
picked
up
his
long
ears
and
snorted
then
madeline
heard
a
slow
pad
of
hoofs
a
horse
was
approaching
from
the
direction
of
the
lake
madeline
had
learned
to
be
wary
and
mounting
majesty
she
turned
him
toward
the
open
a
moment
later
she
felt
glad
of
her
caution
for
looking
back
between
the
trees
she
saw
stewart
leading
a
horse
into
the
grove
she
would
as
lief
have
met
a
guerrilla
as
this
cowboy
majesty
had
broken
into
a
trot
when
a
shrill
whistle
rent
the
air
the
horse
leaped
and
wheeling
so
swiftly
that
he
nearly
unseated
madeline
he
charged
back
straight
for
the
mesquites
madeline
spoke
to
him
cried
angrily
at
him
pulled
with
all
her
strength
upon
the
bridle
but
was
helplessly
unable
to
stop
him
he
whistled
a
piercing
blast
madeline
realized
then
that
stewart
his
old
master
had
called
him
and
that
nothing
could
turn
him
she
gave
up
trying
and
attended
to
the
urgent
need
of
intercepting
mesquite
boughs
that
majesty
thrashed
into
motion
the
horse
thumped
into
an
aisle
between
the
trees
and
stopping
before
stewart
whinnied
eagerly
madeline
not
knowing
what
to
expect
had
not
time
for
any
feeling
but
amaze
a
quick
glance
showed
her
stewart
in
rough
garb
dressed
for
the
trail
and
leading
a
wiry
horse
saddled
and
packed
when
stewart
without
looking
at
her
put
his
arm
around
majesty
neck
and
laid
his
face
against
the
flowing
mane
madeline
heart
suddenly
began
to
beat
with
unwonted
quickness
stewart
seemed
oblivious
to
her
presence
his
eyes
were
closed
his
dark
face
softened
lost
its
hardness
and
fierceness
and
sadness
and
for
an
instant
became
beautiful
madeline
instantly
divined
what
his
action
meant
he
was
leaving
the
ranch
this
was
his
to
his
horse
how
strange
sad
fine
was
this
love
between
man
and
beast
a
dimness
confused
madeline
eyes
she
hurriedly
brushed
it
away
and
it
came
back
wet
and
blurring
she
averted
her
face
ashamed
of
the
tears
stewart
might
see
she
was
sorry
for
him
he
was
going
away
and
this
time
judging
from
the
nature
of
his
farewell
to
his
horse
it
was
to
be
forever
like
a
stab
from
a
cold
blade
a
pain
shot
through
madeline
heart
the
wonder
of
it
the
incomprehensibility
of
it
the
utter
newness
and
strangeness
of
this
sharp
pain
that
now
left
behind
a
dull
pang
made
her
forget
stewart
her
surroundings
everything
except
to
search
her
heart
maybe
here
was
the
secret
that
had
eluded
her
she
trembled
on
the
brink
of
something
unknown
in
some
strange
way
the
emotion
brought
back
her
girlhood
her
mind
revolved
swift
queries
and
replies
she
was
living
feeling
learning
happiness
mocked
at
her
from
behind
a
barred
door
and
the
bar
of
that
door
seemed
to
be
an
inexplicable
pain
then
like
lightning
strokes
shot
the
questions
why
should
pain
hide
her
happiness
what
was
her
happiness
what
relation
had
it
to
this
man
why
should
she
feel
strangely
about
his
departure
and
the
voices
within
her
were
silenced
stunned
unanswered
i
want
to
talk
to
you
said
stewart
madeline
started
turned
to
him
and
now
she
saw
the
earlier
stewart
the
man
who
reminded
her
of
their
first
meeting
at
el
cajon
of
that
memorable
meeting
at
chiricahua
i
want
to
ask
you
something
he
went
on
i
been
wanting
to
know
something
that
why
i
hung
on
here
you
never
spoke
to
me
never
noticed
me
never
gave
me
a
chance
to
ask
you
but
now
i
going
over
over
the
border
and
i
want
to
know
why
did
you
refuse
to
listen
to
me
at
his
last
words
that
hot
shame
tenfold
more
stifling
than
when
it
had
before
humiliated
madeline
rushed
over
her
sending
the
scarlet
in
a
wave
to
her
temples
it
seemed
that
his
words
made
her
realize
she
was
actually
face
to
face
with
him
that
somehow
a
shame
she
would
rather
have
died
than
revealed
was
being
liberated
biting
her
lips
to
hold
back
speech
she
jerked
on
majesty
bridle
struck
him
with
her
whip
spurred
him
stewart
iron
arm
held
the
horse
then
madeline
in
a
flash
of
passion
struck
at
stewart
face
missed
it
struck
again
and
hit
with
one
pull
almost
drawing
her
from
the
saddle
he
tore
the
whip
from
her
hands
it
was
not
that
action
on
his
part
or
the
sudden
strong
masterfulness
of
his
look
so
much
as
the
livid
mark
on
his
face
where
the
whip
had
lashed
that
quieted
if
it
did
not
check
her
fury
that
nothing
he
said
with
something
of
his
old
audacity
nothing
to
how
you
hurt
madeline
battled
with
herself
for
control
this
man
would
not
be
denied
never
before
had
the
hardness
of
his
face
the
flinty
hardness
of
these
men
so
struck
her
with
its
revelation
of
the
unbridled
spirit
he
looked
stern
haggard
bitter
the
dark
shade
was
changing
to
gray
the
gray
to
of
passion
about
him
now
there
was
only
the
ghost
of
that
finer
gentler
man
she
had
helped
to
bring
into
being
the
piercing
dark
eyes
he
bent
upon
her
burned
her
went
through
her
as
if
he
were
looking
into
her
soul
then
madeline
quick
sight
caught
a
fleeting
doubt
a
wistfulness
a
surprised
and
saddened
certainty
in
his
eyes
saw
it
shade
and
pass
away
her
woman
intuition
as
keen
as
her
sight
told
her
stewart
in
that
moment
had
sustained
a
shock
of
bitter
final
truth
for
the
third
time
he
repeated
his
question
to
her
madeline
did
not
answer
she
could
not
speak
you
do
know
i
love
you
do
you
he
continued
passionately
that
ever
since
you
stood
before
me
in
that
hole
at
chiricahua
i
loved
you
you
ca
see
i
been
another
man
loving
you
working
for
you
living
for
you
you
wo
believe
i
turned
my
back
on
the
old
wild
life
that
i
been
decent
and
honorable
and
happy
and
useful
your
kind
of
a
cowboy
you
could
tell
though
i
loved
you
that
i
never
wanted
you
to
know
it
that
i
never
dared
to
think
of
you
except
as
my
angel
my
holy
virgin
what
do
you
know
of
a
man
heart
and
soul
how
could
you
tell
of
the
love
the
salvation
of
a
man
who
lived
his
life
in
the
silence
and
loneliness
who
could
teach
you
the
actual
truth
that
a
wild
cowboy
faithless
to
mother
and
sister
except
in
memory
riding
a
hard
drunken
trail
straight
to
hell
had
looked
into
the
face
the
eyes
of
a
beautiful
woman
infinitely
beyond
him
above
him
and
had
so
loved
her
that
he
was
saved
that
he
became
faithful
again
that
he
saw
her
face
in
every
flower
and
her
eyes
in
the
blue
heaven
who
could
tell
you
when
at
night
i
stood
alone
under
these
western
stars
how
deep
in
my
soul
i
was
glad
just
to
be
alive
to
be
able
to
do
something
for
you
to
be
near
you
to
stand
between
you
and
worry
trouble
danger
to
feel
somehow
that
i
was
a
part
just
a
little
part
of
the
west
you
had
come
to
love
madeline
was
mute
she
heard
her
heart
thundering
in
her
ears
stewart
leaped
at
her
his
powerful
hand
closed
on
her
arm
she
trembled
his
action
presaged
the
old
instinctive
violence
no
but
you
think
i
kept
bonita
up
in
the
mountains
that
i
went
secretly
to
meet
her
that
all
the
while
i
served
you
i
was
oh
i
know
what
you
think
i
know
now
i
never
knew
till
i
made
you
look
at
me
now
say
it
speak
blinded
utterly
in
the
fiery
grasp
of
passion
powerless
to
stem
the
rush
of
a
word
both
shameful
and
revealing
and
fatal
madeline
cried
yes
he
had
wrenched
that
word
from
her
but
he
was
not
subtle
enough
not
versed
in
the
mystery
of
woman
motive
enough
to
divine
the
deep
significance
of
her
reply
for
him
the
word
had
only
literal
meaning
confirming
the
dishonor
in
which
she
held
him
dropping
her
arm
he
shrank
back
a
strange
action
for
the
savage
and
crude
man
she
judged
him
to
be
but
that
day
at
chiricahua
you
spoke
of
faith
he
burst
out
you
said
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
was
faith
in
human
nature
you
said
the
finest
men
had
been
those
who
had
fallen
low
and
had
risen
you
said
you
had
faith
in
me
you
made
me
have
faith
in
myself
his
reproach
without
bitterness
or
scorn
was
a
lash
to
her
old
egoistic
belief
in
her
fairness
she
had
preached
a
beautiful
principle
that
she
had
failed
to
live
up
to
she
understood
his
rebuke
she
wondered
and
wavered
but
the
affront
to
her
pride
had
been
too
great
the
tumult
within
her
breast
had
been
too
startlingly
fierce
she
could
not
speak
the
moment
passed
and
with
it
his
brief
rugged
splendor
of
simplicity
you
think
i
am
vile
he
said
you
think
that
about
bonita
and
all
the
time
i
been
i
could
make
you
ashamed
i
could
tell
you
his
passionate
utterance
ceased
with
a
snap
of
his
teeth
his
lips
set
in
a
thin
bitter
line
the
agitation
of
his
face
preceded
a
convulsive
wrestling
of
his
shoulders
all
this
swift
action
denoted
an
inner
combat
and
it
nearly
overwhelmed
him
no
no
he
panted
was
it
his
answer
to
some
mighty
temptation
then
like
a
bent
sapling
released
he
sprang
erect
but
i
be
the
man
the
dog
you
think
me
he
laid
hold
of
her
arm
with
rude
powerful
clutch
one
pull
drew
her
sliding
half
out
of
the
saddle
into
his
arms
she
fell
with
her
breast
against
his
not
wholly
free
of
stirrups
or
horse
and
there
she
hung
utterly
powerless
maddened
writhing
she
tore
to
release
herself
all
she
could
accomplish
was
to
twist
herself
raise
herself
high
enough
to
see
his
face
that
almost
paralyzed
her
did
he
mean
to
kill
her
then
he
wrapped
his
arms
around
her
and
crushed
her
tighter
closer
to
him
she
felt
the
pound
of
his
heart
her
own
seemed
to
have
frozen
then
he
pressed
his
burning
lips
to
hers
it
was
a
long
terrible
kiss
she
felt
him
shake
oh
stewart
i
implore
you
let
me
go
she
whispered
his
white
face
loomed
over
hers
she
closed
her
eyes
he
rained
kisses
upon
her
face
but
no
more
upon
her
mouth
on
her
closed
eyes
her
hair
her
cheeks
her
neck
he
pressed
swift
lips
lips
that
lost
their
fire
and
grew
cold
then
he
released
her
and
lifting
and
righting
her
in
the
saddle
he
still
held
her
arm
to
keep
her
from
falling
for
a
moment
madeline
sat
on
her
horse
with
shut
eyes
she
dreaded
the
light
now
you
ca
say
you
never
been
kissed
stewart
said
his
voice
seemed
a
long
way
off
but
that
was
coming
to
you
so
be
game
here
she
felt
something
hard
and
cold
and
metallic
thrust
into
her
hand
he
made
her
fingers
close
over
it
hold
it
the
feel
of
the
thing
revived
her
she
opened
her
eyes
stewart
had
given
her
his
gun
he
stood
with
his
broad
breast
against
her
knee
and
she
looked
up
to
see
that
old
mocking
smile
on
his
face
go
ahead
throw
my
gun
on
me
be
a
thoroughbred
madeline
did
not
yet
grasp
his
meaning
you
can
put
me
down
in
that
quiet
place
on
the
hill
beside
monty
madeline
dropped
the
gun
with
a
shuddering
cry
of
horror
the
sense
of
his
words
the
memory
of
monty
the
certainty
that
she
would
kill
stewart
if
she
held
the
gun
an
instant
longer
tortured
the
cry
from
her
stewart
stooped
to
pick
up
the
weapon
you
might
have
saved
me
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
trouble
he
said
with
another
flash
of
the
mocking
smile
you
beautiful
and
sweet
and
proud
but
you
no
thoroughbred
majesty
hammond
adios
stewart
leaped
for
the
saddle
of
his
horse
and
with
the
flying
mount
crashed
through
the
mesquites
to
disappear
xxii
the
secret
told
in
the
shaded
seclusion
of
her
room
buried
face
down
deep
among
the
soft
cushions
on
her
couch
madeline
hammond
lay
prostrate
and
quivering
under
the
outrage
she
had
suffered
the
afternoon
wore
away
twilight
fell
night
came
and
then
madeline
rose
to
sit
by
the
window
to
let
the
cool
wind
blow
upon
her
hot
face
she
passed
through
hours
of
unintelligible
shame
and
impotent
rage
and
futile
striving
to
reason
away
her
defilement
the
train
of
brightening
stars
seemed
to
mock
her
with
their
unattainable
passionless
serenity
she
had
loved
them
and
now
she
imagined
she
hated
them
and
everything
connected
with
this
wild
fateful
and
abrupt
west
she
would
go
home
edith
wayne
had
been
right
the
west
was
no
place
for
madeline
hammond
the
decision
to
go
home
came
easily
naturally
she
thought
as
the
result
of
events
it
caused
her
no
mental
strife
indeed
she
fancied
she
felt
relief
the
great
stars
blinking
white
and
cold
over
the
dark
crags
looked
down
upon
her
and
as
always
after
she
had
watched
them
for
a
while
they
enthralled
her
under
western
stars
she
mused
thinking
a
little
scornfully
of
the
romantic
destiny
they
had
blazed
for
her
idle
sentiment
but
they
were
beautiful
they
were
speaking
they
were
mocking
they
drew
her
ah
she
sighed
it
will
not
be
so
very
easy
to
leave
them
after
madeline
closed
and
darkened
the
window
she
struck
a
light
it
was
necessary
to
tell
the
anxious
servants
who
knocked
that
she
was
well
and
required
nothing
a
soft
step
on
the
walk
outside
arrested
her
who
was
there
nels
or
nick
steele
or
stillwell
who
shared
the
guardianship
over
her
now
that
monty
price
was
dead
and
that
other
that
savage
it
was
monstrous
and
unfathomable
that
she
regretted
him
the
light
annoyed
her
complete
darkness
fitted
her
strange
mood
she
retired
and
tried
to
compose
herself
to
sleep
sleep
for
her
was
not
a
matter
of
will
her
cheeks
burned
so
hotly
that
she
rose
to
bathe
them
cold
water
would
not
alleviate
this
burn
and
then
despairing
of
forgetfulness
she
lay
down
again
with
a
shameful
gratitude
for
the
cloak
of
night
stewart
kisses
were
there
scorching
her
lips
her
closed
eyes
her
swelling
neck
they
penetrated
deeper
and
deeper
into
her
blood
into
her
heart
into
her
soul
the
terrible
farewell
kisses
of
a
passionate
hardened
man
despite
his
baseness
he
had
loved
her
late
in
the
night
madeline
fell
asleep
in
the
morning
she
was
pale
and
languid
but
in
a
mental
condition
that
promised
composure
it
was
considerably
after
her
regular
hour
that
madeline
repaired
to
her
office
the
door
was
open
and
just
outside
tipped
back
in
a
chair
sat
stillwell
mawnin
miss
majesty
he
said
as
he
rose
to
greet
her
with
his
usual
courtesy
there
were
signs
of
trouble
in
his
lined
face
madeline
shrank
inwardly
fearing
his
old
lamentations
about
stewart
then
she
saw
a
dusty
ragged
pony
in
the
yard
and
a
little
burro
drooping
under
a
heavy
pack
both
animals
bore
evidence
of
long
arduous
travel
to
whom
do
they
belong
asked
madeline
them
critters
why
danny
mains
replied
stillwell
with
a
cough
that
betrayed
embarrassment
danny
mains
echoed
madeline
wonderingly
wal
i
said
stillwell
was
indeed
not
himself
is
danny
mains
here
she
asked
in
sudden
curiosity
the
old
cattleman
nodded
gloomily
yep
he
hyar
all
right
sloped
in
from
the
hills
an
he
hollered
to
see
bonita
he
locoed
too
about
that
little
hussy
why
he
hardly
said
bill
before
he
begun
to
ask
wild
an
eager
questions
i
took
him
in
to
see
bonita
he
been
there
more
a
evidently
stillwell
sensitive
feelings
had
been
ruffled
curiosity
changed
to
blank
astonishment
which
left
her
with
a
thrilling
premonition
she
caught
her
breath
a
thousand
thoughts
seemed
thronging
for
clear
conception
in
her
mind
rapid
footsteps
with
an
accompaniment
of
clinking
spurs
sounded
in
the
hallway
then
a
young
man
ran
out
upon
the
porch
he
resembled
a
cowboy
in
his
lithe
build
his
garb
and
action
in
the
way
he
wore
his
gun
but
his
face
instead
of
being
red
was
clear
brown
tan
his
eyes
were
blue
his
hair
was
light
and
curly
he
was
a
handsome
boy
at
sight
of
madeline
he
slammed
down
his
sombrero
and
leaping
at
her
he
possessed
himself
of
her
hands
his
swift
violence
not
only
alarmed
her
but
painfully
reminded
her
of
something
she
wished
to
forget
this
cowboy
bent
his
head
and
kissed
her
hands
and
wrung
them
and
when
he
straightened
up
he
was
crying
miss
hammond
she
safe
an
almost
well
an
what
i
feared
most
so
thank

cried

cowboy

tryin
to

to
have
madeline
quick
varying
emotions
were
swallowed
up
in
a
boundless
gladness
something
dark
deep
heavy
and
somber
was
flooded
from
her
heart
she
had
a
sudden
rich
sense
of
gratitude
toward
this
smiling
cowboy
whose
blue
eyes
flashed
through
tears
danny
mains
she
said
tremulously
and
smilingly

danny
mains
availed
himself
of
this
gracious
privilege
stillwell
snorted
the
signs
of
his
phenomenal
smile
were
manifest
otherwise
madeline
would
have
thought
that
snort
an
indication
of
furious
disapproval
bill
straddle
a
chair
said
danny

beggin

i
want
you
to
listen
also
you
the
face
an
eyes
of
a
woman
who
loves
to
hear
of
other
people
happiness
besides
somehow
it
easy
for
me
to
talk
lookin
at
his
manner
subtly
changed
then
possibly
it
took
on
a
little
swagger
certainly
he
lost
the
dignity
that
he
had
shown
under
stress
of
feeling
he
was
now
more
like
a
cowboy
about
to
boast
or
affect
some
stunning
maneuver
walking
off
the
porch
he
stood
before
the
weary
horse
and
burro
played
out
he
exclaimed
then
with
the
swift
violence
so
characteristic
of
men
of
his
class
he
slipped
the
pack
from
the
burro
and
threw
saddle
and
bridle
from
the
horse
there
see
take
a
look
at
the
last
weight
you
ever
packed
you
been
some
faithful
to
danny
mains
an
danny
mains
pays
never
a
saddle
again
or
a
strap
or
a
halter
or
a
hobble
so
long
as
you
live
so
long
as
you
live
nothin
but
grass
an
clover
an
cool
water
in
shady
places
an
dusty
swales
to
roll
in
an
rest
an
sleep
then
he
untied
the
pack
and
taking
a
small
heavy
sack
from
it
he
came
back
upon
the
porch
deliberately
he
dumped
the
contents
of
the
sack
at
stillwell
feet
piece
after
piece
of
rock
thumped
upon
the
floor
the
pieces
were
sharp
ragged
evidently
broken
from
a
ledge
the
body
of
them
was
white
in
color
with
yellow
veins
and
bars
and
streaks
stillwell
grasped
up
one
rock
after
another
stared
and
stuttered
put
the
rocks
to
his
lips
dug
into
them
with
his
shaking
fingers
then
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
head
against
the
wall
and
as
he
gaped
at
danny
the
old
smile
began
to
transform
his
face
lord
danny
if
you
hev
been
an
gone
an
struck
it
rich
danny
regarded
stillwell

sweet
an
pretty
as
as

mountain
quail
gene
fetched
up
padre
marcos
an
he
married
danny
paused
in
his
narrative
breathing
hard
as
if
the
memory
of
the
incident
described
had
stirred
strong
and
thrilling
feeling
in
him
stillwell
smile
was
rapturous
madeline

toward
danny
with
her
eyes
shining
miss
hammond
an
you

the
afternoon
bonita
an
i
were
married
when
gene
an
the
padre
had
gone
i
was
happy
one
minute
an
the
next
i
was
miserable
because
i
had
a
bad
name
i
could
buy
even
a
decent
dress
for
my
pretty
wife
bonita
heard
me
an
she
was
some
mysterious
she
told
me
the
story
of
the
lost
mine
of
the
padres
an
she
kissed
me
an
made
joyful
over
me
in
the
strangest
way
i
knew
marriage
went
to
women
heads
an
i
thought
even
bonita
had
a
spell
well
she
left
me
for
a
little
an
when
she
came
back
she
wore
some
pretty
yellow
flowers
in
her
hair
her
eyes
were
big
an
black
beautiful
she
said
some
queer
things
about
spirits
rollin
rocks
down
the
canyon
then
she
said
she
wanted
to
show
me
where
she
always
sat
waited
an
watched
for
me
when
i
was
away
she
led
me
around
under
the
crags
to
a
long
slope
it
was
some
pretty
there
clear
an
open
with
a
long
sweep
an
the
desert
yawnin
deep
an
red
there
were
yellow
flowers
on
that
slope
the
same
kind
she
had
in
her
hair
the
same
kind
that
apache
girl
wore
hundreds
of
years
ago
when
she
led
the
padre
to
the
when
i
thought
of
that
an
saw
bonita
eyes
an
then
heard
the
strange
crack
of
rollin
rocks
heard
them
rattle
down
an
roll
grow
faint
i
was
some
out
of
my
head
but
not
for
long
them
rocks
were
rollin
all
right
only
it
was
the
weatherin
of
the
cliffs
an
there
under
the
crags
was
a
gold
pocket
then
i
was
worse
than
locoed

an
the
only
bitter
drop
in
my
cup
is
that
i
ca
ever
pay
monty
madeline
lips
tremblingly
formed
to
tell
danny
mains
and
stillwell
that
the
cowboy
they
wanted
so
much
had
left
the
ranch
but
the
flame
of
fine
loyalty
that
burned
in
danny
eyes
the
happiness
that
made
the
old
cattleman
face
at
once
amazing
and
beautiful
stiffened
her
lips
she
watched
the
huge
stillwell
and
the
little
cowboy
both
talking
wildly
as
they
walked
off
arm
in
arm
to
find
stewart
she
imagined
something
of
what
danny
disappointment
would
be
of
the
elder
consternation
and
grief
when
he
learned
stewart
had
left
for
the
border
at
this
juncture
she
looked
up
to
see
a
strange
yet
familiar
figure
approaching
padre
marcos
certain
it
was
that
madeline
felt
herself
trembling
what
did
his
presence
mean
on
this
day
he
had
always
avoided
meeting
her
whenever
possible
he
had
been
exceedingly
grateful
for
all
she
had
done
for
his
people
his
church
and
himself
but
he
had
never
thanked
her
in
person
perhaps
he
had
come
for
that
purpose
now
but
madeline
did
not
believe
so
mention
of
padre
marcos
sight
of
him
had
always
occasioned
madeline
a
little
indefinable
shock
and
now
as
he
stepped
to
the
porch
a
shrunken
stooped
and
man
she
was
startled
the
padre
bowed
low
to
her
senora
will
you
grant
me
audience
he
asked
in
perfect
english
and
his
voice
was
and
grave
certainly
padre
marcos
replied
madeline
and
she
led
him
into
her
office
may
i
beg
to
close
the
doors
he
asked
it
is
a
matter
of
great
moment
which
you
might
not
care
to
have
any
one
wonderingly
madeline
inclined
her
head
the
padre
gently
closed
one
door
and
then
the
others
senora
i
have
come
to
disclose
a
secret
my
own
sinfulness
in
keeping
it
and
to
implore
your
pardon
do
you
remember
that
night
senor
stewart
dragged
me
before
you
in
the
at
el
cajon
yes
replied
madeline
senora
since
that
night
you
have
been
senor
stewart
wife
madeline
became
as
motionless
as
stone
she
seemed
to
feel
nothing
only
to
hear
you
are
senor
stewart
wife
i
have
kept
the
secret
under
fear
of
death
but
i
could
keep
it
no
longer
senor
stewart
may
kill
me
now
ah
senora
it
is
very
strange
to
you
you
were
so
frightened
that
night
you
knew
not
what
happened
senor
stewart
threatened
me
he
forced
you
he
made
me
speak
the
service
he
made
you
speak
the
spanish
yes
and
i
senora
knowing
the
deeds
of
these
sinful
cowboys
fearing
worse
than
disgrace
to
one
so
beautiful
and
so
good
as
you
i
could
not
do
less
than
marry
you
truly
at
least
you
should
be
his
wife
so
i
married
you
truly
in
the
service
of
my
my
god
cried
madeline
rising
hear
me
i
implore
you
senora
hear
me
out
do
not
leave
me
do
not
look
so
so
ah
senora
let
me
speak
a
word
for
senor
stewart
he
was
drunk
that
night
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
about
in
the
morning
he
came
to
me
made
me
swear
by
my
cross
that
i
would
not
reveal
the
disgrace
he
had
put
upon
you
if
i
did
he
would
kill
me
life
is
nothing
to
the
american
vaquero
senora
i
promised
to
respect
his
command
but
i
did
not
tell
him
you
were
his
wife
he
did
not
dream
i
had
truly
married
you
he
went
to
fight
for
the
freedom
of
my
country
senora
he
is
one
splendid
soldier
and
i
brooded
over
the
sin
of
my
secret
if
he
were
killed
i
need
never
tell
you
but
if
he
lived
i
knew
that
i
must
some
day
strange
indeed
that
senor
stewart
and
padre
marcos
should
both
come
to
this
ranch
together
the
great
change
your
goodness
wrought
in
my
beloved
people
was
no
greater
than
the
change
in
senor
stewart
senora
i
feared
you
would
go
away
one
day
go
back
to
your
eastern
home
ignorant
of
the
truth
the
time
came
when
i
confessed
to
stewart
said
i
must
tell
you
senor
the
man
went
mad
with
joy
i
have
never
seen
so
supreme
a
joy
he
threatened
no
more
to
kill
me
that
strong
cruel
vaquero
begged
me
not
to
tell
the
secret
never
to
reveal
it
he
confessed
his
love
for
you
a
love
something
like
the
desert
storm
he
swore
by
all
that
was
once
sacred
to
him
and
by
my
cross
and
my
church
that
he
would
be
a
good
man
that
he
would
be
worthy
to
have
you
secretly
his
wife
for
the
little
time
life
left
him
to
worship
at
your
shrine
you
needed
never
to
know
so
i
held
my
tongue
half
pitying
him
half
fearing
him
and
praying
for
some
light
senora
it
was
a
fool
paradise
that
stewart
lived
in
i
saw
him
often
when
he
took
me
up
into
the
mountains
to
have
me
marry
that
wayward
bonita
and
her
lover
i
came
to
have
respect
for
a
man
whose
ideas
about
nature
and
life
and
god
were
at
a
variance
with
mine
but
the
man
is
a
worshiper
of
god
in
all
material
things
he
is
a
part
of
the
wind
and
sun
and
desert
and
mountain
that
have
made
him
i
have
never
heard
more
beautiful
words
than
those
in
which
he
persuaded
bonita
to
accept
senor
mains
to
forget
her
old
lovers
and
henceforth
to
be
happy
he
is
their
friend
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
what
that
means
it
sounds
so
simple
it
is
really
simple
all
great
things
are
so
for
senor
stewart
it
was
natural
to
be
loyal
to
his
friend
to
have
a
fine
sense
of
the
honor
due
to
a
woman
who
had
loved
and
given
to
bring
about
their
marriage
to
succor
them
in
their
need
and
loneliness
it
was
natural
for
him
never
to
speak
of
them
it
would
have
been
natural
for
him
to
give
his
life
in
their
defense
if
peril
menaced
them
senora
i
want
you
to
understand
that
to
me
the
man
has
the
same
stability
the
same
strength
the
same
elements
which
i
am
in
the
habit
of
attributing
to
the
physical
life
around
me
in
this
wild
and
rugged
madeline
listened
as
one
under
a
spell
it
was
not
only
that
this
eloquent
priest
knew
how
to
move
the
heart
stir
the
soul
but
his
defense
his
praise
of
stewart
if
they
had
been
couched
in
the
crude
speech
of
cowboys
would
have
been
a
glory
to
her
senora
i
pray
you
do
not
misunderstand
my
mission
beyond
my
confession
to
you
i
have
only
a
duty
to
tell
you
of
the
man
whose
wife
you
are
but
i
am
a
priest
and
i
can
read
the
soul
the
ways
of
god
are
inscrutable
i
am
only
a
humble
instrument
you
are
a
noble
woman
and
senor
stewart
is
a
man
of
desert
iron
forged
anew
in
the
crucible
of
love
quien
sabe
senor
stewart
swore
he
would
kill
me
if
i
betrayed
him
but
he
will
not
lift
his
hand
against
me
for
the
man
bears
you
a
very
great
and
pure
love
and
it
has
changed
him
i
no
longer
fear
his
threat
but
i
do
fear
his
anger
should
he
ever
know
i
spoke
of
his
love
of
his
fool
paradise
i
have
watched
his
dark
face
turned
to
the
sun
setting
over
the
desert
i
have
watched
him
lift
it
to
the
light
of
the
stars
think
my
gracious
and
noble
lady
think
what
is
his
paradise
to
love
you
above
the
spirit
of
the
flesh
to
know
you
are
his
wife
his
never
to
be
another
except
by
his
sacrifice
to
watch
you
with
a
secret
glory
of
joy
and
pride
to
stand
while
he
might
between
you
and
evil
to
find
his
happiness
in
service
to
wait
with
never
a
dream
of
telling
you
for
the
hour
to
come
when
to
leave
you
free
he
must
go
out
and
get
himself
shot
senora
that
is
beautiful
it
is
sublime
it
is
terrible
it
has
brought
me
to
you
with
my
confession
i
repeat
senora
the
ways
of
god
are
inscrutable
what
is
the
meaning
of
your
influence
upon
senor
stewart
once
he
was
merely
an
animal
brutal
unquickened
now
he
is
a
man
i
have
not
seen
his
like
so
i
beseech
you
in
my
humble
office
as
priest
as
a
lover
of
mankind
before
you
send
stewart
to
his
death
to
be
sure
there
is
here
no
mysterious
dispensation
of
god
love
that
mighty
and
blessed
and
unknown
thing
might
be
at
work
senora
i
have
heard
that
somewhere
in
the
rich
eastern
cities
you
are
a
very
great
lady
i
know
you
are
good
and
noble
that
is
all
i
want
to
know
to
me
you
are
only
a
woman
the
same
as
senor
stewart
is
only
a
man
so
i
pray
you
senora
before
you
let
stewart
give
you
freedom
at
such
cost
be
sure
you
do
not
want
his
love
lest
you
cast
away
something
sweet
and
ennobling
which
you
yourself
have
xxiii
the
light
of
western
stars
blinded
like
a
wild
creature
madeline
hammond
ran
to
her
room
she
felt
as
if
a
stroke
of
lightning
had
shattered
the
shadowy
substance
of
the
dream
she
had
made
of
real
life
the
wonder
of
danny
mains
story
the
strange
regret
with
which
she
had
realized
her
injustice
to
stewart
the
astounding
secret
as

marcos
these
were
forgotten
in
the
sudden
consciousness
of
her
own
love
madeline
fled
as
if
pursued
with
trembling
hands
she
locked
the
doors
drew
the
blinds
of
the
windows
that
opened
on
the
porch
pushed
chairs
aside
so
that
she
could
pace
the
length
of
her
room
she
was
now
alone
and
she
walked
with
soft
hurried
uneven
steps
she
could
be
herself
here
she
needed
no
mask
the
long
habit
of
serenely
hiding
the
truth
from
the
world
and
from
herself
could
be
broken
the
seclusion
of
her
darkened
chamber
made
possible
that
betrayal
of
herself
to
which
she
was
impelled
she
paused
in
her
swift
pacing
to
and
fro
she
liberated
the
thought
that
knocked
at
the
gates
of
her
mind
with
quivering
lips
she
whispered
it
then
she
spoke
aloud
i
will
say
it
hear
it
i
i
love
him
i
love
him
she
repeated
the
astounding
truth
but
she
doubted
her
identity
am
i
still
madeline
hammond
what
has
happened
who
am
i
she
stood
where
the
light
from
one
unclosed
window
fell
upon
her
image
in
the
mirror
who
is
this
woman
she
expected
to
see
a
familiar
dignified
person
a
quiet
unruffled
figure
a
tranquil
face
with
dark
proud
eyes
and
calm
proud
lips
no
she
did
not
see
madeline
hammond
she
did
not
see
any
one
she
knew
were
her
eyes
like
her
heart
playing
her
false
the
figure
before
her
was
instinct
with
pulsating
life
the
hands
she
saw
clasped
together
pressed
deep
into
a
swelling
bosom
that
heaved
with
each
panting
breath
the
face
she
saw
white
rapt
strangely
glowing
with
parted
quivering
lips
with
great
staring
tragic
eyes
this
could
not
be
madeline
hammond
face
yet
as
she
looked
she
knew
no
fancy
could
really
deceive
her
that
she
was
only
madeline
hammond
come
at
last
to
the
end
of
brooding
dreams
she
swiftly
realized
the
change
in
her
divined
its
cause
and
meaning
accepted
it
as
inevitable
and
straightway
fell
back
again
into
the
mood
of
bewildering
amaze
calmness
was
unattainable
the
surprise
absorbed
her
she
could
not
go
back
to
count
the
innumerable
imperceptible
steps
of
her
undoing
her
old
power
of
reflecting
analyzing
even
thinking
at
all
seemed
to
have
vanished
in
a
sense
of
one
new
emotion
she
only
felt
all
her
instinctive
outward
action
that
was
a
physical
relief
all
her
involuntary
inner
strife
that
was
maddening
yet
unutterably
sweet
and
they
seemed
to
be
just
one
bewildering
effect
of
surprise
in
a
nature
like
hers
where
strength
of
feeling
had
long
been
inhibited
as
a
matter
of
training
such
a
transforming
surprise
as
sudden
consciousness
of
passionate
love
required
time
for
its
awakening
time
for
its
sway
by
and
by
that
last
enlightening
moment
came
and
madeline
hammond
faced
not
only
the
love
in
her
heart
but
the
thought
of
the
man
she
loved
suddenly
as
she
raged
something
in
her
this
dauntless
new
personality
took
arms
against
indictment
of
gene
stewart
her
mind
whirled
about
him
and
his
life
she
saw
him
drunk
brutal
she
saw
him
abandoned
lost
then
out
of
the
picture
she
had
of
him
thus
slowly
grew
one
of
a
different
man
weak
sick
changed
by
shock
growing
strong
strangely
spiritually
altered
silent
lonely
like
an
eagle
secretive
tireless
faithful
soft
as
a
woman
hard
as
iron
to
endure
and
at
the
last
noble
she
softened
in
a
flash
her
complex
mood
changed
to
one
wherein
she
thought
of
the
truth
the
beauty
the
wonder
of
stewart
uplifting
humbly
she
trusted
that
she
had
helped
him
to
climb
that
influence
had
been
the
best
she
had
ever
exerted
it
had
wrought
magic
in
her
own
character
by
it
she
had
reached
some
higher
nobler
plane
of
trust
in
man
she
had
received
infinitely
more
than
she
had
given
her
swiftly
flying
memory
seemed
to
assort
a
vast
mine
of
treasures
of
the
past
of
that
letter
stewart
had
written
to
her
brother
she
saw
vivid
words
but
ah
she
had
known
and
if
it
had
not
made
any
difference
then
now
it
made
all
in
the
world
she
recalled
how
her
loosened
hair
had
blown
across
his
lips
that
night
he
had
ridden
down
from
the
mountains
carrying
her
in
his
arms
she
recalled
the
strange
joy
of
pride
in
stewart
eyes
when
he
had
suddenly
come
upon
her
dressed
to
receive
her
eastern
guests
in
the
white
gown
with
the
red
roses
at
her
breast
swiftly
as
they
had
come
these
dreamful
memories
departed
there
was
to
be
no
rest
for
her
mind
all
she
had
thought
and
felt
seemed
only
to
presage
a
tumult
heedless
desperate
she
cast
off
the
last
remnant
of
turned
from
the
old
proud
pale
cold
ghost
of
herself
to
face
this
strange
strong
passionate
woman
then
with
hands
pressed
to
her
beating
heart
with
eyes
shut
she
listened
to
the
ringing
voice
of
circumstance
of
truth
of
fatality
the
whole
story
was
revealed
simple
enough
in
the
sum
of
its
complicated
details
strange
and
beautiful
in
part
remorseless
in
its
proof
of
great
love
on
stewart
side
in
dreaming
blindness
on
her
own
and
from
the
first
fatal
moment
to
the
last
prophetic
of
tragedy
madeline
like
a
prisoner
in
a
cell
began
again
to
pace
to
and
fro
oh
it
is
all
terrible
she
cried
i
am
his
wife
his
wife
that
meeting
with
him
the
marriage
then
his
fall
his
love
his
rise
his
silence
his
pride
and
i
can
never
be
anything
to
him
could
i
be
anything
to
him
i
madeline
hammond
but
i
am
his
wife
and
i
love
him
his
wife
i
am
the
wife
of
a
cowboy
that
might
be
undone
can
my
love
be
undone
ah
do
i
want
anything
undone
he
is
gone
gone
could
he
have
meant
i
will
not
dare
not
think
of
that
he
will
come
back
no
he
never
will
come
back
oh
what
shall
i
do
for
madeline
hammond
the
days
following
that
storm
of
feeling
were
endless
hopeless
a
long
succession
of
weary
hours
sleepless
hours
passionate
hours
all
haunted
by
a
fear
slowly
growing
into
torture
a
fear
that
stewart
had
crossed
the
border
to
invite
the
bullet
which
would
give
her
freedom
the
day
came
when
she
knew
this
to
be
true
the
spiritual
tidings
reached
her
not
subtly
as
so
many
divinations
had
come
but
in
a
clear
vital
flash
of
certainty
then
she
suffered
she
burned
inwardly
and
the
nature
of
that
deep
fire
showed
through
her
eyes
she
kept
to
herself
waiting
waiting
for
her
fears
to
be
confirmed
at
times
she
broke
out
in
wrath
at
the
circumstances
she
had
failed
to
control
at
herself
at
stewart
he
might
have
learned
from
ambrose
she
exclaimed
sick
with
a
bitterness
she
knew
was
not
consistent
with
her
pride
she
recalled
christine
trenchant
exposition
of
ambrose
wooing
he
tell
me
he
love
me
he
kees
me
he
hug
me
he
put
me
on
his
horse
he
ride
away
with
me
he
marry
then
in
the
next
breath
madeline
denied
this
insistent
clamoring
of
a
love
that
was
gradually
breaking
her
spirit
like
a
somber
shadow
remorse
followed
her
shading
blacker
she
had
been
blind
to
a
honesty
manliness
uprightness
faith
and
striving
she
had
been
dead
to
love
to
nobility
that
she
had
herself
created
padre
marcos
grave
wise
words
returned
to
haunt
her
she
fought
her
bitterness
scorned
her
intelligence
hated
her
pride
and
weakening
gave
up
more
and
more
to
a
yearning
hopeless
hope
she
had
shunned
the
light
of
the
stars
as
she
had
violently
dismissed
every
hinting
suggestive
memory
of
stewart
kisses
but
one
night
she
went
deliberately
to
her
window
there
they
shone
her
stars
beautiful
passionless
as
always
but
strangely
closer
warmer
speaking
a
kinder
language
helpful
as
they
had
never
been
teaching
her
now
that
regret
was
futile
revealing
to
her
in
their
one
grand
blazing
task
the
supreme
duty
of
life
to
be
true
those
shining
stars
made
her
yield
she
whispered
to
them
that
they
had
claimed
her
the
west
claimed
her
stewart
claimed
her
forever
whether
he
lived
or
died
she
gave
up
to
her
love
and
it
was
as
if
he
was
there
in
person
violent
in
his
action
crushing
her
to
his
breast
in
that
farewell
moment
kissing
her
with
one
burning
kiss
of
passion
then
with
cold
terrible
lips
of
renunciation
i
am
your
wife
she
whispered
to
him
in
that
moment
throbbing
exalted
quivering
in
her
first
sweet
tumultuous
surrender
to
love
she
would
have
given
her
all
her
life
to
be
in
his
arms
again
to
meet
his
lips
to
put
forever
out
of
his
power
any
thought
of
wild
sacrifice
and
on
the
morning
of
the
next
day
when
madeline
went
out
upon
the
porch
stillwell
haggard
and
stern
with
a
husky
incoherent
word
handed
her
a
message
from
el
cajon
she
read
el
capitan
stewart
captured
by
rebel
soldiers
in
fight
at
agua
prieta
yesterday
he
was
a
sharpshooter
in
the
federal
ranks
sentenced
to
death
thursday
at
sunset
xxiv
the
ride
stillwell
madeline
cry
was
more
than
the
utterance
of
a
breaking
heart
it
was
full
of
agony
but
also
it
uttered
the
shattering
of
a
structure
built
of
false
pride
of
old
beliefs
of
bloodless
standards
of
ignorance
of
self
it
betrayed
the
final
conquest
of
her
doubts
and
out
of
their
darkness
blazed
the
unquenchable
spirit
of
a
woman
who
had
found
herself
her
love
her
salvation
her
duty
to
a
man
and
who
would
not
be
cheated
the
old
cattleman
stood
mute
before
her
staring
at
her
white
face
at
her
eyes
of
flame
stillwell
i
am
stewart
wife
my
gawd
miss
majesty
he
burst
out
i
knowed
somethin
turrible
was
wrong
aw
sure
it
a
pity
do
you
think
i
let
him
be
shot
when
i
know
him
now
when
i
no
longer
blind
when
i
love
him
she
asked
with
passionate
swiftness
i
will
save
him
this
is
wednesday
morning
i
have
hours
to
save
his
life
stillwell
send
for
link
and
the
car
she
went
into
her
office
her
mind
worked
with
extraordinary
rapidity
and
clearness
her
plan
born
in
one
flash
of
thought
necessitated
the
careful
wording
of
telegrams
to
washington
to
new
york
to
san
antonio
these
were
to
senators
representatives
men
high
in
public
and
private
life
men
who
would
remember
her
and
who
would
serve
her
to
their
utmost
never
before
had
her
position
meant
anything
to
her
comparable
with
what
it
meant
now
never
in
all
her
life
had
money
seemed
the
power
that
it
was
then
if
she
had
been
poor
a
shuddering
chill
froze
the
thought
at
its
inception
she
dispelled
heartbreaking
thoughts
she
had
power
she
had
wealth
she
would
set
into
operation
all
the
unlimited
means
these
gave
her
the
wires
and
pulleys
and
strings
underneath
the
surface
of
political
and
international
life
the
open
free
purchasing
value
of
money
or
the
deep
underground
mysterious
incalculably
powerful
influence
moved
by
gold
she
could
save
stewart
she
must
await
results
deadlocked
in
feeling
strained
perhaps
almost
beyond
endurance
because
the
suspense
would
be
great
but
she
would
allow
no
possibility
of
failure
to
enter
her
mind
when
she
went
outside
the
car
was
there
with
link
helmet
in
hand
a
cool
bright
gleam
in
his
eyes
and
with
stillwell
losing
his
haggard
misery
beginning
to
respond
to
madeline
spirit
link
drive
stillwell
to
el
cajon
in
time
for
him
to
catch
the
el
paso
train
she
said
wait
there
for
his
return
and
if
any
message
comes
from
him
telephone
it
at
once
to
then
she
gave
stillwell
the
telegrams
to
send
from
el
cajon
and
drafts
to
cash
in
el
paso
she
instructed
him
to
go
before
the
rebel
junta
then
stationed
at
juarez
to
explain
the
situation
to
bid
them
expect
communications
from
washington
officials
requesting
and
advising
stewart
exchange
as
a
prisoner
of
war
to
offer
to
buy
his
release
from
the
rebel
authorities
when
stillwell
had
heard
her
through
his
huge
bowed
form
straightened
a
ghost
of
his
old
smile
just
moved
his
lips
he
was
no
longer
young
and
hope
could
not
at
once
drive
away
stern
and
grim
realities
as
he
bent
over
her
hand
his
manner
appeared
courtly
and
reverent
but
either
he
was
speechless
or
felt
the
moment
not
one
for
him
to
break
silence
he
climbed
to
a
seat
beside
link
who
pocketed
the
watch
he
had
been
studying
and
leaned
over
the
wheel
there
was
a
crack
a
muffled
sound
bursting
into
a
roar
and
the
big
car
jerked
forward
to
bound
over
the
edge
of
the
slope
to
leap
down
the
long
incline
to
shoot
out
upon
the
level
valley
floor
and
disappear
in
moving
dust
for
the
first
time
in
days
madeline
visited
the
gardens
the
corrals
the
lakes
the
quarters
of
the
cowboys
though
imagining
she
was
calm
she
feared
she
looked
strange
to
nels
to
nick
to
frankie
slade
to
those
boys
best
known
to
her
the
situation
for
them
must
have
been
one
of
tormenting
pain
and
bewilderment
they
acted
as
if
they
wanted
to
say
something
to
her
but
found
themselves
spellbound
she
wondered
did
they
know
she
was
stewart
wife
stillwell
had
not
had
time
to
tell
them
besides
he
would
not
have
mentioned
the
fact
these
cowboys
only
knew
that
stewart
was
sentenced
to
be
shot
they
knew
if
madeline
had
not
been
angry
with
him
he
would
not
have
gone
in
desperate
fighting
mood
across
the
border
she
spoke
of
the
weather
of
the
horses
and
cattle
asked
nels
when
he
was
to
go
on
duty
and
turned
away
from
the
wide
sunlit
porch
where
the
cowboys
stood
silent
and
bareheaded
then
one
of
her
subtle
impulses
checked
her
nels
you
and
nick
need
not
go
on
duty
she
said
i
may
want
you
i
i
she
hesitated
paused
and
stood
lingering
there
her
glance
had
fallen
upon
stewart
big
black
horse
prancing
in
a
corral
i
have
sent
stillwell
to
el
paso
she
went
on
in
a
low
voice
she
failed
to
hold
steady
he
will
save
stewart
i
have
to
tell
you
i
am
stewart
wife
she
felt
the
stricken
amaze
that
made
these
men
silent
and
immovable
with
level
gaze
averted
she
left
them
returning
to
the
house
and
her
room
she
prepared
for
something
for
what
to
wait
then
a
great
invisible
shadow
seemed
to
hover
behind
her
she
essayed
many
tasks
to
fail
of
attention
to
find
that
her
mind
held
only
stewart
and
his
fortunes
why
had
he
become
a
federal
she
reflected
that
he
had
won
his
title
el
capitan
fighting
for
madero
the
rebel
but
madero
was
now
a
federal
and
stewart
was
true
to
him
in
crossing
the
border
had
stewart
any
other
motive
than
the
one
he
had
implied
to
madeline
in
his
mocking
smile
and
scornful
words
you
might
have
saved
me
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
trouble
what
trouble
she
felt
again
the
cold
shock
of
contact
with
the
gun
she
had
dropped
in
horror
he
meant
the
trouble
of
getting
himself
shot
in
the
only
way
a
man
could
seek
death
without
cowardice
but
had
he
any
other
motive
she
recalled
don
carlos
and
his
guerrillas
then
the
thought
leaped
up
in
her
mind
with
gripping
power
that
stewart
meant
to
hunt
don
carlos
to
meet
him
to
kill
him
it
would
be
the
deed
of
a
silent
vengeful
implacable
man
driven
by
wild
justice
such
as
had
been
the
deadly
leaven
in
monty
price
it
was
a
deed
to
expect
of
nels
or
nick
steel
and
aye
of
gene
stewart
madeline
felt
regret
that
stewart
as
he
had
climbed
so
high
had
not
risen
above
deliberate
seeking
to
kill
his
enemy
however
evil
that
enemy
the
local
newspapers
which
came
regularly
a
day
late
from
el
paso
and
douglas
had
never
won

endured

endured
for
long
interminable
hours
while
holding
to
her
hope
with
indomitable
will
no
message
came
at
sunset
she
went
outdoors
suffering
a
torment
of
accumulating
suspense
she
faced
the
desert
hoping
praying
for
strength
the
desert
did
not
influence
her
as
did
the
passionless
unchangeable
stars
that
had
soothed
her
spirit
it
was
red
mutable
shrouded
in
shadows
terrible
like
her
mood
a
sunset
colored
the
vast
brooding
naked
waste
of
rock
and
sand
the
grim
chiricahua
frowned
black
and
sinister
the
dim
blue
domes
of
the
guadalupes
seemed
to
whisper
to
beckon
to
her
beyond
them
somewhere
was
stewart
awaiting
the
end
of
a
few
brief
hours
hours
that
to
her
were
boundless
endless
insupportable
night
fell
but
now
the
white
pitiless
stars
failed
her
then
she
sought
the
seclusion
and
darkness
of
her
room
there
to
lie
with
wide
eyes
waiting
waiting
she
had
always
been
susceptible
to
the
somber
mystic
unrealities
of
the
night
and
now
her
mind
slowly
revolved
round
a
vague
and
monstrous
gloom
nevertheless
she
was
acutely
sensitive
to
outside
impressions
she
heard
the
measured
tread
of
a
guard
the
rustle
of
wind
stirring
the
the
remote
mournful
wail
of
a
coyote
by
and
by
the
dead
silence
of
the
night
insulated
her
with
leaden
oppression
there
was
silent
darkness
for
so
long
that
when
the
window
casements
showed
gray
she
believed
it
was
only
fancy
and
that
dawn
would
never
come
she
prayed
for
the
sun
not
to
rise
not
to
begin
its
short
journey
toward
what
might
be
a
fatal
setting
for
stewart
but
the
dawn
did
lighten
swiftly
she
thought
remorselessly
daylight
had
broken
and
this
was
thursday
sharp
ringing
of
the
telephone
bell
startled
her
roused
her
into
action
she
ran
to
answer
the
call
hello
hello
miss
majesty
came
the
hurried
reply
this
is
link
talkin
messages
for
you
favorable
the
operator
said
i
to
ride
out
with
them
i
come
that
was
all
madeline
heard
the
bang
of
the
receiver
as
stevens
threw
it
down
she
passionately
wanted
to
know
more
but
was
immeasurably
grateful
for
so
much
favorable
then
stillwell
had
been
successful
her
heart
leaped
suddenly
she
became
weak
and
her
hands
failed
of
their
accustomed
morning
deftness
it
took
her
what
seemed
a
thousand
years
to
dress
breakfast
meant
nothing
to
her
except
that
it
helped
her
to
pass
dragging
minutes
finally
a
low
hum
mounting
swiftly
to
a
roar
and
ending
with
a
sharp
report
announced
the
arrival
of
the
car
if
her
feet
had
kept
pace
with
her
heart
she
would
have
raced
out
to
meet
link
she
saw
him
helmet
thrown
back
watch
in
hand
and
he
looked
up
at
her
with
his
cool
bright
smile
with
his
familiar
apologetic
manner
minutes
miss
majesty
he
said
but
i
hed
to
ride
round
a
herd
of
steers
an
bump
a
couple
off
the
he
gave
her
a
packet
of
telegrams
madeline
tore
them
open
with
shaking
fingers
began
to
read
with
swift
dim
eyes
some
were
from
washington
assuring
her
of
every
possible
service
some
were
from
new
york
others
written
in
spanish
were
from
el
paso
and
these
she
could
not
wholly
translate
in
a
brief
glance
would
she
never
find
stillwell

it
was
the
last
it
was
lengthy
it

arranged
for

safe
if
we
can
get

not

by

afraid
to

nothing

all
trust
him
let
him
drive
that
car
stillwell
the
first
few
lines
of
stillwell
message
lifted
madeline
to
the
heights
of
thanksgiving
and
happiness
then
reading
on
she
experienced
a
check
a
numb
icy
sickening
pang
at
the
last
line
she
flung
off
doubt
and
dread
and
in
white
cold
passion
faced
the
issue
read
she
said
briefly
handing
the
telegram
to
link
he
scanned
it
and
then
looked
blankly
up
at
her
link
do
you
know
the
roads
the
trails
the
desert
between
here
and
agua
prieta
she
asked
thet
sure
my
old
an
i
know
sonora
we
must
reach
agua
prieta
before
sunset
long
before
so
if
stewart
is
in
some
camp
we
can
get
to
it
in
in
miss
majesty
it
ai
possible
he
exclaimed
stillwell
crazy
to
say
link
can
an
automobile
be
driven
from
here
into
northern
mexico
sure
but
it
take
we
must
do
it
in
little
time
she
went
on
in
swift
eagerness
otherwise
stewart
may
be
probably
will
be
be
link
stevens
appeared
suddenly
to
grow
lax
shriveled
to
lose
all
his
peculiar
pert
brightness
to
weaken
and
age
i
only
a
a
cowboy
miss
he
almost
faltered
it
was
a
singular
change
in
him
thet
an
awful
ride
down
over
the
border
if
by
some
luck
i
did
smash
the
car
i
turn
your
hair
gray
you
never
be
no
good
after
thet
ride
i
am
stewart
wife
she
answered
him
and
she
looked
at
him
not
conscious
of
any
motive
to
persuade
or
allure
but
just
to
let
him
know
the
greatness
of
her
dependence
upon
him
he
started
violently
the
old
action
of
stewart
the
memorable
action
of
monty
price
this
man
was
of
the
same
wild
breed
then
madeline
words
flowed
in
a
torrent
i
am
stewart
wife
i
love
him
i
have
been
unjust
to
him
i
must
save
him
link
i
have
faith
in
you
i
beseech
you
to
do
your
best
for
stewart
sake
for
my
sake
risk
the
ride
gladly
bravely
i
not
care
where
or
how
you
drive
far
rather
plunge
into
a
canyon
go
to
my
death
on
the
rocks
than
not
try
to
save
how
beautiful
the
response
of
this
rude
cowboy
to
realize
his
absolute
unconsciousness
of
self
to
see
the
haggard
shade
burn
out
of
his
face
the
old
cool
spirit
return
to
his
eyes
and
to
feel
something
wonderful
about
him
then
it
was
more
than
will
or
daring
or
sacrifice
a
might
have
existed
between
him
and
madeline
she
sensed
again
that
indefinable
quality
so
fine
so
almost
invisible
which
seemed
to
be
an
inalienable
trait
in
these
wild
cowboys
miss
majesty
thet
ride
figgers
impossible
but
i
do
it
he
replied
his
cool
bright
glance
thrilled
her
i
need
mebbe
half
an
hour
to
go
over
the
car
an
to
pack
on
what
i
she
could
not
thank
him
and
her
reply
was
merely
a
request
that
he
tell
nels
and
other
cowboys
off
duty
to
come
up
to
the
house
when
link
had
gone
madeline
gave
a
moment
thought
to
preparations
for
the
ride
she
placed
what
money
she
had
and
the
telegrams
in
a
satchel
the
gown
she
had
on
was
thin
and
white
not
suitable
for
travel
but
she
would
not
risk
the
losing
of
one
moment
in
changing
it
she
put
on
a
long
coat
and
wound
veils
round
her
head
and
neck
arranging
them
in
a
hood
so
she
could
cover
her
face
when
necessary
she
remembered
to
take
an
extra
pair
of
goggles
for
nels
use
and
then
drawing
on
her
gloves
she
went
out
ready
for
the
ride
a
number
of
cowboys
were
waiting
she
explained
the
situation
and
left
them
in
charge
of
her
home
with
that
she
asked
nels
to
accompany
her
down
into
the
desert
he
turned
white
to
his
lips
and
this
occasioned
madeline
to
remember
his
mortal
dread
of
the
car
and
link
driving
nels
i
sorry
to
ask
you
she
added
i
know
you
hate
the
car
but
i
need
you
may
need
you
oh
so
why
miss
majesty
thet
shore
all
a
mistaken
idee
of
yours
about
me
hatin
the
car
he
said
in
his
slow
soft
drawl
i
was
only
jealous
of
link
an
the
boys
they
made
thet
joke
up
on
me
about
bein
scared
of
ridin
fast
shore
i
powerful
proud
to
go
an
i
reckon
if
you
hed
asked
me
my
feelin
might
hev
been
some
hurt
because
if
goin
down
among
the
greasers
you
want
his
cool
easy
speech
his
familiar
swagger
the
smile
with
which
he
regarded
her
did
not
in
the
least
deceive
madeline
the
gray
was
still
in
his
face
incomprehensible
as
it
seemed
nels
had
a
dread
an
uncanny
fear
and
it
was
of
that
huge
white
automobile
but
he
lied
about
it
here
again
was
that
strange
quality
of
faithfulness
madeline
heard
the
buzz
of
the
car
link
appeared
driving
up
the
slope
he
made
a
short
sliding
turn
and
stopped
before
the
porch
link
had
tied
two
long
heavy
planks
upon
the
car
one
on
each
side
and
in
every
available
space
he
had
strapped
extra
tires
a
huge
cask
occupied
one
back
seat
and
another
seat
was
full
of
tools
and
ropes
there
was
just
room
in
this
rear
part
of
the
car
for
nels
to
squeeze
in
link
put
madeline
in
front
beside
him
then
bent
over
the
wheel
madeline
waved
her
hand
at
the
silent
cowboys
on
the
porch
not
an
audible
was
spoken
the
car
glided
out
of
the
yard
leaped
from
level
to
slope
and
started
swiftly
down
the
road
out
into
the
open
valley
each
stronger
rush
of
dry
wind
in
madeline
face
marked
the
increase
of
speed
she
took
one
glance
at
the
winding
smooth
unobstructed
disappearing
in
the
gray
of
distance
she
took
another
at
the
driver
beside
her
and
then
she
drew
the
hood
of
veils
over
her
face
and
fastened
it
round
her
neck
so
there
was
no
possibility
of
its
blowing
loose
harder
and
stronger
pressed
the
wind
till
it
was
like
sheeted
lead
forcing
her
back
in
her
seat
there
was
a
ceaseless
intense
inconceivably
rapid
vibration
under
her
occasionally
she
felt
a
long
swing
as
if
she
were
to
be
propelled
aloft
but
no
jars
disturbed
the
easy
celerity
of
the
car
the
buzz
the
roar
of
wheels
of
heavy
body
in
flight
increased
to
a
continuous
droning
hum
the
wind
became
an
insupportable
body
moving
toward
her
crushing
her
breast
making
the
task
of
breathing
most
difficult
to
madeline
the
time
seemed
to
fly
with
the
speed
of
miles
a
moment
came
when
she
detected
a
faint
difference
in
hum
and
rush
and
vibration
in
the
ceaseless
sweeping
of
the
invisible
weight
against
her
this
difference
became
marked
link
was
reducing
speed
then
came
swift
change
of
all
sensation
and
she
realized
the
car
had
slowed
to
normal
travel
madeline
removed
her
hood
and
goggles
it
was
a
relief
to
breathe
freely
to
be
able
to
use
her
eyes
to
her
right
not
far
distant
lay
the
little
town
of
chiricahua
sight
of
it
made
her
remember
stewart
in
a
way
strange
to
her
constant
thought
of
him
to
the
left
inclined
the
gray
valley
the
red
desert
was
hidden
from
view
but
the
guadalupe
mountains
loomed
close
in
the
southwest
opposite
chiricahua
where
the
road
forked
link
stevens
headed
the
car
straight
south
and
gradually
increased
speed
madeline
faced
another
endless
gray
incline
it
was
the
san
bernardino
valley
the
singing
of
the
car
the
stinging
of
the
wind
warned
her
to
draw
the
hood
securely
down
over
her
face
again
and
then
it
was
as
if
she
was
riding
at
night
the
car
lurched
ahead
settled
into
that
driving
speed
which
wedged
madeline
back
as
in
a
vise
again
the
moments
went
by
fleet
as
the
miles
seemingly
there
was
an
acceleration
of
the
car
till
it
reached
a
certain
swiftness
a
period
of
time
in
which
it
held
that
pace
and
then
a
diminishing
of
all
motion
and
sound
which
contributed
to
acute
sensation
uncovering
her
face
she
saw
link
was
passing
another
village
could
it
be
bernardino
she
asked
link
repeated
the
question
sure
he
replied
eighty
link
did
not
this
time
apologize
for
the
work
of
his
machine
madeline
marked
the
omission
with
her
first
thrill
of
the
ride
leaning
over
she
glanced
at
link
watch
which
he
had
fastened
upon
the
wheel
in
front
of
his
eyes
a
quarter
to
ten
link
had
indeed
made
short
work
of
the
valley
miles
beyond
bernardino
link
sheered
off
the
road
and
put
the
car
to
a
long
slope
here
the
valley
appeared
to
run
south
under
the
dark
brows
of
the
guadalupes
link
was
heading
southwest
madeline
observed
that
the
grass
began
to
fail
as
they
climbed
the
ridge
bare
white
dusty
spots
appeared
there
were
patches
of
mesquite
and
cactus
and
scattering
areas
of
broken
rock
she
might
have
been
prepared
for
what
she
saw
from
the
beneath
them
the
desert
blazed
seen
from
afar
it
was
striking
enough
but
riding
down
into
its
red
jaws
gave
madeline
the
first
affront
to
her
imperious
confidence
all
about
her
ranch
had
been
desert
the
valleys
were
desert
but
this
was
different
here
began
the
red
desert
extending
far
into
mexico
far
across
arizona
and
california
to
the
pacific
she
saw
a
bare
hummocky
ridge
down
which
the
car
was
gliding
bounding
swinging
and
this
long
slant
seemed
to
merge
into
a
corrugated
world
of
rock
and
sand
patched
by
flats
and
basins
streaked
with
canyons
and
ranges
of
ragged
stone
the
distant
sierra
madres
were
clearer
bluer
less
smoky
and
suggestive
of
mirage
than
she
had
ever
seen
them
madeline
sustaining
faith
upheld
her
in
the
face
of
this
appalling
obstacle
then
the
desert
that
had
rolled
its
immensity
beneath
her
gradually
began
to
rise
to
lose
its
distant
margins
to
condense
its
varying
lights
and
shades
at
last
to
hide
its
yawning
depths
and
looming
heights
behind
red
ridges
which
were
only
little
steps
little
outposts
little
landmarks
at
its
gates
the
bouncing
of
the
huge
car
throwing
madeline
up
directed
her
attention
and
fastened
it
upon
the
way
link
stevens
was
driving
and
upon
the
immediate
foreground
then
she
discovered
that
he
was
following
an
old
at
the
foot
of
that
long
slope
they
struck
into
rougher
ground
and
here
link
took
to
a
cautious
zigzag
course
the
disappeared
and
then
presently
reappeared
but
link
did
not
always
hold
to
it
he
made
cuts
detours
crosses
and
all
the
time
seemed
to
be
getting
deeper
into
a
maze
of
low
red
dunes
of
flat
lined
by
banks
of
gravel
of
ridges
mounting
higher
yet
link
stevens
kept
on
and
never
turned
back
he
never
headed
into
a
place
that
he
could
not
pass
up
to
this
point
of
travel
he
had
not
been
compelled
to
back
the
car
and
madeline
began
to
realize
that
it
was
the
cowboy
wonderful
judgment
of
ground
that
made
advance
possible
he
knew
the
country
he
was
never
at
a
loss
after
making
a
choice
of
direction
he
never
hesitated
then
at
the
bottom
of
a
wide
canyon
he
entered
a
wash
where
the
wheels
just
barely
turned
in
dragging
sand
the
sun
beat
down
the
dust
arose
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
and
no
sound
save
the
slide
of
a
rock
now
and
then
down
the
weathered
slopes
and
the
labored
chugging
of
the
machine
the
snail
pace
like
the
sand
at
the
wheels
began
to
drag
at
madeline
faith
link
gave
over
the
wheel
to
madeline
and
leaping
out
he
called
nels
when
they
untied
the
long
planks
and
laid
them
straight
in
front
for
the
wheels
to
pass
over
madeline
saw
how
wise
had
been
link
forethought
with
the
aid
of
those
planks
they
worked
the
car
through
sand
and
gravel
otherwise
impossible
to
pass
this
canyon
widened
and
opened
into
space
affording
an
unobstructed
view
for
miles
the
desert
sloped
up
in
steps
and
in
the
morning
light
with
the
sun
bright
on
the
mesas
and
escarpments
it
was
gray
drab
stone
slate
yellow
pink
and
dominating
all
a
dull
there
was
level
ground
ahead
a
floor
as
hard
as
rock
link
rushed
the
car
over
this
free
distance
madeline
ears
filled
with
a
droning
hum
like
the
sound
of
a
monstrous
hungry
bee
and
with
a
strange
incessant
crinkle
which
she
at
length
guessed
to
be
the
spreading
of
sheets
of
gravel
from
under
the
wheels
the
giant
car
attained
such
a
speed
that
madeline
could
only
distinguish
the
colored
landmarks
to
the
fore
and
these
faded
as
the
wind
stung
her
eyes
then
link
began
the
ascent
of
the
first
step
a
long
sweeping
barren
waste
with
dunes
of
wonderful
violet
and
heliotrope
hues
here
were
marks
of
an
old
lately
traversed
by
cattle
the
car
climbed
steadily
surmounted
the
height
faced
another
long
bench
that
had
been
cleaned
smooth
by
desert
winds
the
sky
was
an
intense
light
steely
blue
hard
on
the
eyes
madeline
veiled
her
face
and
did
not
uncover
it
until
link
had
reduced
the
racing
speed
from
the
summit
of
the
next
ridge
she
saw
more
red
ruin
of
desert
a
deep
wash
crossing
the
road
caused
link
stevens
to
turn
due
south
there
was
a
narrow
space
along
the
wash
just
wide
enough
for
the
car
link
seemed
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
the
outside
wheels
were
perilously
close
to
the
edge
madeline
heard
the
rattle
of
loosened
gravel
and
earth
sliding
into
the
gully
the
wash
widened
and
opened
out
into
a
sandy
flat
link
crossed
this
and
turned
up
on
the
opposite
side
rocks
impeded
the
progress
of
the
car
and
these
had
to
be
rolled
out
of
the
way
the
shelves
of
silt
apparently
ready
to
slide
with
the
slightest
weight
the
little
tributary
washes
the
stretches
of
slope
the
narrow
spaces
allowing
no
more
than
a
foot
for
the
outside
wheels
the
cactus
that
had
to
be
avoided
all
these
obstacles
were
as
nothing
to
the
cowboy
driver
he
kept
on
and
when
he
came
to
the
road
again
he
made
up
for
the
lost
time
by
speed
another
height
was
reached
and
here
madeline
fancied
that
link
had
driven
the
car
to
the
summit
of
a
high
pass
between
two
mountain
ranges
the
western
slope
of
that
pass
appeared
to
be
exceedingly
rough
and
broken
below
it
spread
out
another
gray
valley
at
the
extreme
end
of
which
glistened
a
white
spot
that
link
grimly
called
douglas
part
of
that
white
spot
was
agua
prieta
the
sister
town
across
the
line
madeline
looked
with
eyes
that
would
fain
have
pierced
the
intervening
distance
the
descent
of
the
pass
began
under
difficulties
sharp
stones
and
cactus
spikes
penetrated
the
front
tires
bursting
them
with
ripping
reports
it
took
time
to
replace
them
the
planks
were
called
into
requisition
to
cross
soft
places
a
jagged
point
of
projecting
rock
had
to
be
broken
with
a
sledge
at
length
a
huge
stone
appeared
to
hinder
any
further
advance
madeline
caught
her
breath
there
was
no
room
to
turn
the
car
but
link
stevens
had
no
intention
of
such
a
thing
he
backed
the
car
to
a
considerable
distance
then
walked
forward
he
appeared
to
be
busy
around
the
boulder
for
a
moment
and
returned
down
the
road
on
the
run
a
heavy
explosion
a
cloud
of
dust
and
a
rattle
of
falling
fragments
told
madeline
that
her
indomitable
driver
had
cleared
a
passage
with
dynamite
he
seemed
to
be
prepared
for
every
emergency
madeline
looked
to
see
what
effect
the
discovery
of
link
carrying
dynamite
would
have
upon
the
silent
nels
shore
now
miss
majesty
there
ai
nothin
goin
to
stop
link
said
nels
with
a
reassuring
smile
the
significance
of
the
incident
had
not
dawned
upon
nels
or
else
he
was
heedless
of
it
after
all
he
was
afraid
only
of
the
car
and
link
and
that
fear
was
an
idiosyncrasy
madeline
began
to
see
her
cowboy
driver
with
clearer
eyes
and
his
spirit
awoke
something
in
her
that
made
danger
of
no
moment
nels
likewise
subtly
responded
and
though
he
was
his
eyes
took
on
the
cool
bright
gleam
of
link
cactus
barred
the
way
rocks
barred
the
way
gullies
barred
the
way
and
these
nels
addressed
in
the
grim
humor
with
which
he
was
wont
to
view
tragic
things
a
mistake
on
link
part
a
slip
of
a
wheel
a
bursting
of
a
tire
at
a
critical
moment
an
instant
of
the
bad
luck
which
might
happen
a
hundred
times
on
a
less
perilous
ride
any
one
of
these
might
spell
disaster
for
the
car
perhaps
death
to
the
occupants
again
and
again
link
used
the
planks
to
cross
washes
in
sand
sometimes
the
wheels
ran
all
the
length
of
the
planks
sometimes
slipped
off
presently
link
came
to
a
ditch
where
water
had
worn
deep
into
the
road
without
hesitation
he
placed
them
measuring
distance
carefully
and
then
started
across
the
danger
was
in
ditching
the
machine
one
of
the
planks
split
sagged
a
little
but
link
made
the
crossing
without
a
slip
the
road
led
round
under
an
overhanging
cliff
and
was
narrow
rocky
and
slightly
downhill
bidding
madeline
and
nels
walk
round
this
hazardous
corner
link
drove
the
car
madeline
expected
to
hear
it
crash
down
into
the
canyon
but
presently
she
saw
link
waiting
to
take
them
aboard
again
then
came
steeper
parts
of
the
road
places
that
link
could
run
down
if
he
had
space
below
to
control
the
car
and
on
the
other
hand
places
where
the
little
inclines
ended
in
abrupt
ledges
upon
one
side
or
a
declivity
upon
the
other
here
the
cowboy
with
ropes
on
the
wheels
and
upon
the
spurs
of
rock
let
the
car
slide
down
once
at
a
particularly
bad
spot
madeline
exclaimed
involuntarily
oh
time
is
flying
link
stevens
looked
up
at
her
as
if
he
had
been
reproved
for
his
care
his
eyes
shone
like
the
glint
of
steel
on
ice
perhaps
that
utterance
of
madeline
was
needed
to
liberate
his
recklessness
to
its
utmost
certainly
he
put
the
car
to
seemingly
impossible
feats
he
rimmed
gullies
he
hurdled
rising
ground
he
leaped
little
breaks
in
the
even
road
he
made
his
machine
cling
like
a
goat
to
steep
inclines
he
rounded
corners
with
the
inside
wheels
higher
than
the
outside
he
passed
over
banks
of
soft
earth
that
caved
in
the
instant
he
crossed
weak
places
he
kept
on
and
on
threading
tortuous
passages
through
patches
keeping
to
the
old
road
where
it
was
clear
abandoning
it
for
open
spaces
and
always
going
down
at
length
a
mile
of
clean
brown
slope
ridged
and
grooved
like
a
washboard
led
gently
down
to
meet
the
floor
of
the
valley
where
the
scant
struggled
to
give
a
tinge
of
gray
the
road
appeared
to
become
more
clearly
defined
and
could
be
seen
striking
straight
across
the
valley
to
madeline
dismay
that
road
led
down
to
a
deep
narrow
wash
it
plunged
on
one
side
ascended
on
the
other
at
a
still
steeper
angle
the
crossing
would
have
been
laborsome
for
a
horse
for
an
automobile
it
was
unpassable
link
turned
the
car
to
the
right
along
the
rim
and
drove
as
far
along
the
wash
as
the
ground
permitted
the
gully
widened
deepened
all
the
way
then
he
took
the
other
direction
when
he
made
this
turn
madeline
observed
that
the
sun
had
perceptibly
begun
its
slant
westward
it
shone
in
her
face
glaring
and
wrathful
link
drove
back
to
the
road
crossed
it
and
kept
on
down
the
line
of
the
wash
it
was
a
deep
cut
in
red
earth
worn
straight
down
by
swift
water
in
the
rainy
seasons
it
narrowed
in
some
places
it
was
only
five
feet
wide
link
studied
these
points
and
looked
up
the
slope
and
seemed
to
be
making
deductions
the
valley
was
level
now
and
there
were
nothing
but
little
breaks
in
the
rim
of
the
link
drove
mile
after
mile
looking
for
a
place
to
cross
and
there
was
none
finally
progress
to
the
south
was
obstructed
by
impassable
gullies
where
the
wash
plunged
into
the
head
of
a
canyon
it
was
necessary
to
back
the
car
a
distance
before
there
was
room
to
turn
madeline
looked
at
the
imperturbable
driver
his
face
revealed
no
more
than
the
same
old
hard
immutable
character
when
he
reached
the
narrowest
points
which
had
so
interested
him
he
got
out
of
the
car
and
walked
from
place
to
place
once
with
a
little
jump
he
cleared
the
then
madeline
noted
that
the
farther
rim
was
somewhat
lower
in
a
flash
she
divined
link
intention
he
was
hunting
a
place
to
jump
the
car
over
the
crack
in
the
ground
soon
he
found
one
that
seemed
to
suit
him
for
he
tied
his
red
scarf
upon
a
then
returning
to
the
car
he
clambered
in
and
muttering
broke
his
long
silence
this
ai
no
but
i
outfiggered
thet
damn
he
backed
up
the
gentle
slope
and
halted
just
short
of
steeper
ground
his
red
scarf
waved
in
the
wind
hunching
low
over
the
wheel
he
started
slowly
at
first
then
faster
and
then
faster
the
great
car
gave
a
spring
like
a
huge
tiger
the
impact
of
suddenly
formed
wind
almost
tore
madeline
out
of
her
seat
she
felt
nels
powerful
hands
on
her
shoulders
she
closed
her
eyes
the
jolting
headway
of
the
car
gave
place
to
a
gliding
rush
this
was
broken
by
a
slight
jar
and
then
above
the
hum
and
roar
rose
a
cowboy
yell
madeline
waited
with
strained
nerves
for
the
expected
crash
it
did
not
come
opening
her
eyes
she
saw
the
level
valley
floor
without
a
break
she
had
not
even
noticed
the
instant
when
the
car
had
shot
over
the
a
strange
breathlessness
attacked
her
and
she
attributed
it
to
the
celerity
with
which
she
was
being
carried
along
pulling
the
hood
down
over
her
face
she
sank
low
in
the
seat
the
whir
of
the
car
now
seemed
to
be
a
sound
again
the
feeling
of
excitement
the
poignancy
of
emotional
heights
the
impending
sense
of
catastrophe
became
held
in
abeyance
to
the
sheer
intensity
of
physical
sensations
there
came
a
time
when
all
her
strength
seemed
to
unite
in
an
effort
to
lift
her
breast
against
the
terrific
force
of
the
wind
to
draw
air
into
her
flattened
lungs
she
became
partly
dazed
the
darkness
before
her
eyes
was
not
all
occasioned
by
the
blood
that
pressed
like
a
stone
mask
on
her
face
she
had
a
sense
that
she
was
floating
sailing
drifting
reeling
even
while
being
borne
swiftly
as
a
thunderbolt
her
hands
and
arms
were
immovable
under
the
weight
of
mountains
there
was
a
long
blank
period
from
which
she
awakened
to
feel
an
arm
supporting
her
then
she
rallied
the
velocity
of
the
car
had
been
cut
to
the
speed
to
which
she
was
accustomed
throwing
back
the
hood
she
breathed
freely
again
recovered
fully
the
car
was
bowling
along
a
wide
road
upon
the
outskirts
of
a
city
madeline
asked
what
place
it
could
be
douglas
replied
link
an
jest
around
is
agua
prieta
that
last
name
seemed
to
stun
madeline
she
heard
no
more
and
saw
little
until
the
car
stopped
nels
spoke
to
some
one
then
sight
of
soldiers
quickened
madeline
faculties
she
was
on
the
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
and
agua
prieta
with
its
white
and
blue
walled
houses
its
roofs
lay
before
her
a
soldier
evidently
despatched
by
nels
returned
and
said
an
officer
would
come
at
once
madeline
attention
was
centered
in
the
foreground
upon
the
guard
over
the
road
upon
the
dry
dusty
town
beyond
but
she
was
aware
of
noise
and
people
in
the
rear
a
cavalry
officer
approached
the
car
stared
and
removed
his
sombrero
can
you
tell
me
anything
about
stewart
the
american
cowboy
who
was
captured
by
rebels
a
few
days
ago
asked
madeline
yes
replied
the
officer
there
was
a
skirmish
over
the
line
between
a
company
of
federals
and
a
large
force
of
guerrillas
and
rebels
the
federals
were
driven
west
along
the
line
stewart
is
reported
to
have
done
reckless
fighting
and
was
captured
he
got
a
mexican
sentence
he
is
known
here
along
the
border
and
the
news
of
his
capture
stirred
up
excitement
we
did
all
we
could
to
get
his
release
the
guerrillas
feared
to
execute
him
here
and
believed
he
might
be
aided
to
escape
so
a
detachment
departed
with
him
for
he
was
sentenced
to
be
shot
thursday
at
sunset
yes
it
was
rumored
there
was
a
personal
resentment
against
stewart

can
with
a
wondering
glance
at
her
the
officer
received
the
telegrams
he
read
several
and
whistled
low
in
amaze
his
manner
became
quick
alert
serious

link
sent
the
car
whirring
across
the
line
into
mexican
territory
madeline
sensibilities
were
now
exquisitely
alive
the
white
road
led
into
agua
prieta
a
town
of
colored
walls
and
roofs
goats
and
pigs
and
buzzards
scattered
before
the
roar
of
the
machine
native
women
wearing
black
mantles
peeped
through
windows
men
wearing
huge
sombreros
cotton
shirts
and
trousers
bright
sashes
round
their
waists
and
sandals
stood
motionless
watching
the
car
go
by
the
road
ended
in
an
immense
plaza
in
the
center
of
which
was
a
circular
structure
that
in
some
measure
resembled
a
corral
it
was
a
where
the
national
sport
of
was
carried
on
just
now
it
appeared
to
be
quarters
for
a
considerable
army
ragged
unkempt
rebels
were
everywhere
and
the
whole
square
was
littered
with
tents
packs
wagons
arms
there
were
horses
mules
burros
and
oxen
the
place
was
so
crowded
that
link
was
compelled
to
drive
slowly
up
to
the
entrance
to
the
madeline
caught
a
glimpse
of
tents
inside
then
her
view
was
obstructed
by
a
curious
pressing
throng
the
cavalry
officer
leaped
from
the
car
and
pushed
his
way
into
the
entrance
link
do
you
know
the
road
to
this
mezquital
asked
madeline
yes
i
been
how
far
is
it
aw
not
so
very
far
he
mumbled
link
how
many
miles
she
implored
i
reckon
only
a
madeline
knew
that
he
lied
she
asked
him
no
more
nor
looked
at
him
nor
at
nels
how
stifling
was
this
crowded
plaza
the
sun
red
and
lowering
had
sloped
far
down
in
the
west
but
still
burned
with
furnace
heat
a
swarm
of
flies
whirled
over
the
car
the
shadows
of
buzzards
crossed
madeline
sight
then
she
saw
a
row
of
the
huge
uncanny
black
birds
sitting
upon
the
tiled
roof
of
a
house
they
had
neither
an
air
of
sleeping
nor
resting
they
were
waiting
she
fought
off
a
horrible
ghastly
idea
before
its
full
realization
these
rebels
and
guerrillas
what
lean
yellow
bearded
wretches
they
curiously
watched
link
as
he
went
working
over
the
car
no
two
were
alike
and
all
were
ragged
they
had
glittering
eyes
sunk
deep
in
their
heads
they
wore
huge
sombreros
of
brown
and
black
felt
of
straw
of
cloth
every
man
wore
a
belt
or
sash
into
which
was
thrust
some
kind
of
weapon
some
wore
boots
some
shoes
some
moccasins
some
sandals
and
many
were
barefooted
they
were
an
excited
jabbering
gesticulating
mob
madeline
shuddered
to
think
how
a
frenzy
to
spill
blood
could
run
through
these
poor
revolutionists
if
it
was
liberty
they
fought
for
they
did
not
show
the
intelligence
in
their
faces
they
were
like
wolves
upon
a
scent
they
affronted
her
shocked
her
she
wondered
if
their
officers
were
men
of
the
same
class
what
struck
her
at
last
and
stirred
pity
in
her
was
the
fact
that
every
man
of
the
horde
her
swift
glance
roamed
over
however
dirty
and
bedraggled
he
was
wore
upon
him
some
ornament
some
tassel
or
fringe
or
lace
some
ensign
some
band
bracelet
badge
or
belt
some
twist
of
scarf
something
that
betrayed
the
vanity
which
was
the
poor
jewel
of
their
souls
it
was
in
the
race
suddenly
the
crowd
parted
to
let
the
cavalry
officer
and
a
rebel
of
striking
presence
get
to
the
car
madam
it
is
as
i
suspected
said
the
officer
quickly
the
messages
directing
stewart
release
never
reached
salazar
they
were
intercepted
but
even
without
them
we
might
have
secured
exchange
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fact
that
one
of
his
captors
wanted
him
shot
this
guerrilla
intercepted
the
orders
and
then
was
instrumental
in
taking
stewart
to
mezquital
it
is
exceedingly
sad
why
he
should
be
a
free
man
this
instant
i
regret
who
did
this
this
thing
cried
madeline
cold
and
sick
who
is
the
guerrilla
senor
don
carlos
martinez
he
has
been
a
bandit
a
man
of
influence
in
sonora
he
is
more
of
a
secret
agent
in
the
affairs
of
the
revolution
than
an
active
participator
but
he
has
seen
guerrilla
don
carlos
stewart
in
his
power
o
god
madeline
sank
down
almost
overcome
then
two
great
hands
powerful
thrilling
clasped
her
shoulders
and
nels
bent
over
her
miss
majesty
shore
we
wastin
time
here
he
said
his
voice
like
his
hands
was
uplifting
she
wheeled
to
him
in
trembling
importunity
how
cold
bright
blue
the
flash
of
his
eyes
they
told
madeline
she
must
not
weaken
but
she
could
not
speak
her
thought
to
nels
could
only
look
at
link
it
figgers
impossible
but
i
do
it
said
link
stevens
in
answer
to
her
voiceless
query
the
cold
grim
wild
something
about
her
cowboys
blanched
madeline
face
steeled
her
nerve
called
to
the
depths
of
her
for
that
last
supreme
courage
of
a
woman
the
spirit
of
the
moment
was
nature
with
link
and
nels
with
her
it
must
be
passion
can
i
get
a
permit
to
go
into
the
interior
to
mezquital
asked
madeline
of
the
officer
you
are
going
on
madam
it
a
forlorn
hope
mezquital
is
a
hundred
miles
away
but
there
a
chance
the
barest
chance
if
your
man
can
drive
this
car
the
mexicans
are
either
murderous
or
ceremonious
in
their
executions
the
arrangements
for
stewart
will
be
elaborate
but
barring
unusual
circumstances
it
will
take
place
precisely
at
the
hour
designated
you
need
no
permit
your
messages
are
official
papers
but
to
save
time
perhaps
delay
i
suggest
you
take
this
mexican
senor
montes
with
you
he
outranks
don
carlos
and
knows
the
captain
of
the
mezquital
ah
then
don
carlos
is
not
in
command
of
the
forces
holding
stewart
i
thank
you
sir
i
shall
not
forget
your
kindness
concluded
madeline
she
bowed
to
senor
montes
and
requested
him
to
enter
the
car
nels
stowed
some
of
the
paraphernalia
away
making
room
in
the
rear
seat
link
bent
over
the
wheel
the
start
was
so
sudden
with
such
crack
and
roar
that
the
crowd
split
in
wild
disorder
out
of
the
plaza
the
car
ran
gathering
headway
down
a
street
lined
by
white
and
blue
walls
across
a
square
where
rebels
were
building
barricades
along
a
railroad
track
full
of
iron
that
carried
mounted
pieces
of
artillery
through
the
outlying
guards
who
waved
to
the
officer
montes
madeline
bound
her
glasses
tightly
over
her
eyes
and
wound
veils
round
the
lower
part
of
her
face
she
was
all
in
a
strange
glow
she
had
begun
to
burn
to
throb
to
thrill
to
expand
and
she
meant
to
see
all
that
was
possible
the
sullen
sun
red
as
fire
hung
over
the
mountain
range
in
the
west
how
low
it
had
sunk
before
her
stretched
a
narrow
white
road
dusty
hard
as
stone
a
highway
that
had
been
used
for
centuries
if
it
had
been
wide
enough
to
permit
passing
a
vehicle
it
would
have
been
a
magnificent
course
for
automobiles
but
the
weeds
and
the
dusty
flowers
and
the
mesquite
boughs
and
arms
of
cactus
brushed
the
car
as
it
sped
by
faster
faster
faster
that
old
resistless
weight
began
to
press
madeline
back
the
old
incessant
bellow
of
wind
filled
her
ears
link
stevens
hunched
low
over
the
wheel
his
eyes
were
hidden
under
leather
helmet
and
goggles
but
the
lower
part
of
his
face
was
unprotected
he
resembled
a
demon
so
dark
and
and
strangely
grinning
was
he
all
at
once
madeline
realized
how
matchless
how
wonderful
a
driver
was
this
cowboy
she
divined
that
weakening
could
not
have
been
possible
to
link
stevens
he
was
a
cowboy
and
he
really
was
riding
that
car
making
it
answer
to
his
will
as
it
had
been
born
in
him
to
master
a
horse
he
had
never
driven
to
suit
himself
had
never
reached
an
speed
until
now
beyond
that
his
motive
was
to
save
stewart
to
make
madeline
happy
life
was
nothing
to
him
that
fact
gave
him
the
superhuman
nerve
to
face
the
peril
of
this
ride
because
of
his
disregard
of
self
he
was
able
to
operate
the
machine
to
choose
the
power
the
speed
the
guidance
the
going
with
the
best
judgment
and
highest
efficiency
possible
madeline
knew
he
would
get
her
to
mezquital
in
time
to
save
stewart
or
he
would
kill
her
in
the
attempt
the
white
narrow
road
flashed
out
of
the
foreground
slipped
with
inconceivable
rapidity
under
the
car
when
she
marked
a
clump
of
cactus
far
ahead
it
seemed
to
shoot
at
her
to
speed
behind
her
even
the
instant
she
noticed
it
nevertheless
madeline
knew
link
was
not
putting
the
car
to
its
limit
swiftly
as
he
was
flying
he
held
something
in
reserve
but
he
took
the
turns
of
the
road
as
if
he
knew
the
way
was
cleared
before
him
he
trusted
to
a
cowboy
luck
a
wagon
in
one
of
those
curves
a
herd
of
cattle
even
a
frightened
steer
meant
a
wreck
madeline
never
closed
her
eyes
at
these
fateful
moments
if
link
could
stake
himself
the
others
and
her
upon
such
chance
what
could
not
she
stake
with
her
motive
so
while
the
great
car
hummed
and
thrummed
and
darted
round
the
curves
on
two
wheels
and
sped
on
like
a
bullet
madeline
lived
that
ride
meant
to
feel
it
to
the
uttermost
but
it
was
not
all
swift
going
a
stretch
of
softer
ground
delayed
link
made
the
car
labor
and
pant
and
pound
and
grind
through
gravel
moreover
the
cactus
plants
assumed
an
alarming
ability
to
impede
progress
long
slender
arms
of
the
ocotillo
encroached
upon
the
road
broad
round
leaves
did
likewise
fluted
columns
fallen
like
timbers
in
a
forest
lay
along
the
narrow
margins
the
bayonet
cactus
and
the
bisnagi
leaned
threateningly
clusters
of
maguey
shadowed
by
the
huge
looming
saguaro
infringed
upon
the
highway
to
mezquital
and
every
leaf
and
blade
and
branch
of
cactus
bore
wicked
thorns
any
one
of
which
would
be
fatal
to
a
tire
it
came
at
length
the
bursting
report
the
car
lurched
went
on
like
a
crippled
thing
and
halted
obedient
to
the
master
hand
at
the
wheel
swift
as
link
was
in
replacing
the
tire
he
lost
time
the
red
sun
more
sullen
duskier
as
it
neared
the
black
bold
horizon
appeared
to
mock
madeline
to
eye
her
in
derision
link
leaped
in
and
the
car
sprang
ahead
the
changed
the
trees
changed
all
the
surroundings
changed
except
the
cactus
there
were
miles
of
rolling
ridges
rough
in
the
hollows
and
short
rocky
bits
of
road
and
washes
to
cross
and
a
low
sandy
swale
where
mesquites
grouped
a
forest
along
a
trickling
sheet
of
water
green
things
softened
the
hard
dry
aspect
of
the
desert
there
were
birds
and
parrots
and
deer
and
wild
boars
all
these
madeline
remarked
with
clear
eyes
with
remarkable
susceptibility
of
attention
but
what
she
strained
to
see
what
she
yearned
for
prayed
for
was
straight
unobstructed
road
but
the
road
began
to
wind
up
it
turned
and
twisted
in
tantalizing
lazy
curves
it
was
in
no
hurry
to
surmount
a
hill
that
began
to
assume
proportions
of
a
mountain
it
was
leisurely
as
were
all
things
in
mexico
except
strife
that
was
quick
fierce
bloody
it
was
spanish
the
descent
from
that
elevation
was
difficult
extremely
hazardous
yet
link
stevens
drove
fast
at
the
base
of
the
hill
rocks
and
sand
all
but
halted
him
for
good
then
in
taking
an
abrupt
curve
a
grasping
spear
ruined
another
tire
this
time
the
car
rasped
across
the
road
into
the
cactus
bursting
the
second
tire
like
demons
indeed
link
and
nels
worked
shuddering
madeline
felt
the
declining
heat
of
the
sun
saw
with
gloomy
eyes
the
shading
of
the
red
light
over
the
desert
she
did
not
look
back
to
see
how
near
the
sun
was
to
the
horizon
she
wanted
to
ask
nels
strange
as
anything
on
this
terrible
ride
was
the
absence
of
speech
as
yet
no
word
had
been
spoken
madeline
wanted
to
shriek
to
link
to
hurry
but
he
was
more
than
humanly
swift
in
all
his
actions
so
with
mute
lips
with
the
fire
in
her
beginning
to
chill
with
a
lifelessness
menacing
her
spirit
she
watched
hoped
against
hope
prayed
for
a
long
straight
smooth
road
quite
suddenly
she
saw
it
seemingly
miles
of
clear
narrow
lane
disappearing
like
a
thin
white
streak
in
distant
green
perhaps
link
stevens
heart
leaped
like
madeline
the
huge
car
with
a
roar
and
a
jerk
seemed
to
answer
madeline
call
a
cry
no
less
poignant
because
it
was
silent
faster
faster
faster
the
roar
became
a
whining
hum
then
for
madeline
sound
ceased
to
be
anything
she
could
not
hear
the
wind
was
now
heavy
imponderable
no
longer
a
swift
plastic
thing
but
solid
like
an
wall
it
bore
down
upon
madeline
with
such
resistless
weight
that
she
could
not
move
the
green
of
desert
plants
along
the
road
merged
in
two
shapeless
fences
sliding
at
her
from
the
distance
objects
ahead
began
to
blur
the
white
road
to
grow
streaky
like
rays
of
light
the
sky
to
take
on
more
of
a
reddening
haze
madeline
realizing
her
sight
was
failing
her
turned
for
one
more
look
at
link
stevens
it
had
come
to
be
his
ride
almost
as
much
as
it
was
hers
he
hunched
lower
than
ever
rigid
strained
to
the
last
degree
a
terrible
implacable
driver
this
was
his
hour
and
he
was
great
if
he
so
much
as
brushed
a
flying
tire
against
one
of
the
millions
of
spikes
clutching
out
striking
out
from
the
cactus
there
would
be
a
shock
a
splitting
wave
of
air
an
end
madeline
thought
she
saw
that
bulging
cheek
and
jaw
were
gray
that
his
lips
were
white
that
the
smile
was
gone
then
he
really
was
human
not
a
demon
she
felt
a
strange
sense
of
brotherhood
he
understood
a
woman
soul
as
monty
price
had
understood
it
link
was
the
automaton
the
driving
relentless
unconquerable
instrument
of
a
woman
will
he
was
a
man
whose
force
was
directed
by
a
woman
passion
he
reached
up
to
her
height
felt
her
love
understood
the
nature
of
her
agony
these
made
him
heroic
but
it
was
the
hard
life
the
wild
years
of
danger
on
the
desert
the
companionship
of
ruthless
men
the
elemental
that
made
possible
his
physical
achievement
madeline
loved
his
spirit
then
and
gloried
in
the
man
she
had
pictured
upon
her
heart
never
to
be
forgotten
this
little
hunched
deformed
figure
of
link
hanging
with
dauntless
with
deathless
grip
over
the
wheel
his
gray
face
like
a
marble
mask
that
was
madeline
last
clear
sensation
upon
the
ride
blinded
dazed
she
succumbed
to
the
demands
upon
her
strength
she
reeled
fell
back
only
vaguely
aware
of
a
helping
hand
confusion
seized
her
senses
all
about
her
was
a
dark
chaos
through
which
she
was
rushing
rushing
rushing
under
the
wrathful
red
eye
of
a
setting
sun
then
as
there
was
no
more
sound
or
sight
for
her
she
felt
there
was
no
color
but
the
rush
never
slackened
a
rush
through
opaque
limitless
space
for
moments
hours
ages
she
was
propelled
with
the
velocity
of
a
the
earth
seemed
a
huge
automobile
and
it
sped
with
her
down
an
endless
white
track
through
the
universe
looming
ghostly
ghastly
spectral
forms
of
cacti
plants
large
as
stabbed
her
with
giant
spikes
she
became
an
unstable
being
in
a
shapeless
colorless
soundless
cosmos
of
unrelated
things
but
always
rushing
even
to
meet
the
darkness
that
haunted
her
and
never
reached
her
but
at
an
end
of
infinite
time
that
rush
ceased
madeline
lost
the
queer
feeling
of
being
disembodied
by
a
frightfully
swift
careening
through
boundless
distance
she
distinguished
voices
low
at
first
apparently
far
away
then
she
opened
her
eyes
to
blurred
but
conscious
sight
the
car
had
come
to
a
stop
link
was
lying
face
down
over
the
wheel
nels
was
rubbing
her
hands
calling
to
her
she
saw
a
house
with
clean
whitewashed
wall
and
roof
beyond
over
a
dark
mountain
range
peeped
the
last
red
curve
the
last
beautiful
ray
of
the
setting
sun
xxv
at
the
end
of
the
road
madeline
saw
that
the
car
was
surrounded
by
armed
mexicans
they
presented
a
contrast
to
the
others
she
had
seen
that
day
she
wondered
a
little
at
their
silence
at
their
respectful
front
suddenly
a
sharp
spoken
order
opened
up
the
ranks
next
to
the
house
senor
montes
appeared
in
the
break
coming
swiftly
his
dark
face
wore
a
smile
his
manner
was
courteous
important
authoritative
senora
it
is
not
too
late
he
spoke
her
language
with
an
accent
strange
to
her
so
that
it
seemed
to
hinder
understanding
senora
you
got
here
in
time
he
went
on
el
capitan
stewart
will
be
free
she
whispered
she
rose
reeling
come
replied
montes
taking
her
arm
perdoneme
without
his
assistance
she
would
have
fallen
wholly
upon
nels
who
supported
her
on
the
other
side
they
helped
her
alight
from
the
car
for
a
moment
the
white
walls
the
hazy
red
sky
the
dark
figures
of
the
rebels
whirled
before
madeline
eyes
she
took
a
few
steps
swaying
between
her
escorts
then
the
confusion
of
her
sight
and
mind
passed
away
it
was
as
if
she
quickened
with
a
thousand
vivifying
currents
as
if
she
could
see
and
hear
and
feel
everything
in
the
world
as
if
nothing
could
be
overlooked
forgotten
neglected
she
turned
back
remembering
link
he
was
lurching
from
the
car
helmet
and
goggles
thrust
back
the
gray
shade
gone
from
his
face
the
cool
bright
gleam
of
his
eyes
disappearing
for
something
warmer
senor
montes
led
madeline
and
her
cowboys
through
a
hall
to
a
patio
and
on
through
a
large
room
with
flooring
of
rough
bare
boards
that
rattled
into
a
smaller
room
full
of
armed
quiet
rebels
facing
an
open
window
madeline
scanned
the
faces
of
these
men
expecting
to
see
don
carlos
but
he
was
not
present
a
soldier
addressed
her
in
spanish
too
swiftly
uttered
too
voluble
for
her
to
translate
but
like
senor
montes
he
was
gracious
and
despite
his
ragged
garb
and
uncouth
appearance
he
bore
the
unmistakable
stamp
of
authority
montes
directed
madeline
attention
to
a
man
by
the
window
a
loose
scarf
of
vivid
red
hung
from
his
hand
senora
they
were
waiting
for
the
sun
to
set
when
we
arrived
said
montes
the
signal
was
about
to
be
given
for
senor
stewart
walk
to
stewart
walk
echoed
madeline
ah
senora
let
me
tell
you
his
sentence
the
sentence
i
have
had
the
honor
and
happiness
to
revoke
for
stewart
had
been
and
sentenced
according
to
a
mexican
custom
observed
in
cases
of
brave
soldiers
to
whom
honorable
and
fitting
executions
were
due
his
hour
had
been
set
for
thursday
when
the
sun
had
sunk
upon
signal
he
was
to
be
liberated
and
was
free
to
walk
out
into
the
road
to
take
any
direction
he
pleased
he
knew
his
sentence
knew
that
death
awaited
him
that
every
possible
avenue
of
escape
was
blocked
by
men
with
rifles
ready
but
he
had
not
the
slightest
idea
at
what
moment
or
from
what
direction
the
bullets
were
to
come
senora
we
have
sent
messengers
to
every
squad
of
waiting
soldiers
an
order
that
el
capitan
is
not
to
be
shot
he
is
ignorant
of
his
release
i
shall
give
the
signal
for
his
montes
was
ceremonious
gallant
emotional
madeline
saw
his
pride
and
divined
that
the
situation
was
one
which
brought
out
the
vanity
the
ostentation
as
well
as
the
cruelty
of
his
race
he
would
keep
her
in
an
agony
of
suspense
let
stewart
start
upon
that
terrible
walk
in
ignorance
of
his
freedom
it
was
the
motive
of
a
spaniard
suddenly
madeline
had
a
horrible
quaking
fear
that
montes
lied
that
he
meant
her
to
be
a
witness
of
stewart
execution
but
no
the
man
was
honest
he
was
only
barbarous
he
would
satisfy
certain
instincts
of
his
nature
sentiment
romance
cruelty
by
starting
stewart
upon
that
walk
by
watching
stewart
actions
in
the
face
of
seeming
death
by
seeing
madeline
agony
of
doubt
fear
pity
love
almost
madeline
felt
that
she
could
not
endure
the
situation
she
was
weak
and
tottering
senora
ah
it
will
be
one
beautiful
thing
montes
caught
the
scarf
from
the
rebel
hand
he
was
glowing
passionate
his
eyes
had
a
strange
soft
cold
flash
his
voice
was
low
intense
he
was
living
something
splendid
to
him
i
wave
the
scarf
senora
that
will
be
the
signal
it
will
be
seen
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
road
senor
stewart
jailer
will
see
the
signal
take
off
stewart
irons
release
him
open
the
door
for
his
walk
stewart
will
be
free
but
he
will
not
know
he
will
expect
death
as
he
is
a
brave
man
he
will
face
it
he
will
walk
this
way
every
step
of
that
walk
he
will
expect
to
be
shot
from
some
unknown
quarter
but
he
will
not
be
afraid
senora
i
have
seen
el
captain
fighting
in
the
field
what
is
death
to
him
ah
will
it
not
be
magnificent
to
see
him
come
forth
to
walk
down
senora
you
will
see
what
a
man
he
is
all
the
way
he
will
expect
cold
swift
death
here
at
this
end
of
the
road
he
will
meet
his
beautiful
lady
is
there
no
no
possibility
of
a
mistake
faltered
madeline
none
my
order
included
unloading
of
don
carlos
he
is
in
irons
and
must
answer
to
general
salazar
replied
montes
madeline
looked
down
the
deserted
road
how
strange
to
see
the
last
ruddy
glow
of
the
sun
over
the
brow
of
the
mountain
range
the
thought
of
that
sunset
had
been
torture
for
her
yet
it
had
passed
and
now
the
afterlights
were
luminous
beautiful
prophetic
with
a
heart
stricken
by
both
joy
and
agony
she
saw
montes
wave
the
scarf
then
she
waited
no
change
manifested
itself
down
the
length
of
that
lonely
road
there
was
absolute
silence
in
the
room
behind
her
how
terribly
infinitely
long
seemed
the
waiting
never
in
all
her
future
life
would
she
forget
the
quaint
pink
blue
and
white
walled
houses
with
their
colored
roofs
that
dusty
bare
road
resembled
one
of
the
uncovered
streets
of
pompeii
with
its
look
of
centuries
of
solitude
suddenly
a
door
opened
and
a
tall
man
stepped
out
madeline
recognized
stewart
she
had
to
place
both
hands
on
the
for
support
while
a
storm
of
emotion
swayed
her
like
a
retreating
wave
it
rushed
away
stewart
lived
he
was
free
he
had
stepped
out
into
the
light
she
had
saved
him
life
changed
for
her
in
that
instant
of
realization
and
became
sweet
full
strange
stewart
shook
hands
with
some
one
in
the
doorway
then
he
looked
up
and
down
the
road
the
door
closed
behind
him
leisurely
he
rolled
a
cigarette
stood
close
to
the
wall
while
he
scratched
a
match
even
at
that
distance
madeline
keen
eyes
caught
the
small
flame
the
first
little
puff
of
smoke
stewart
then
took
to
the
middle
of
the
road
and
leisurely
began
his
walk
to
madeline
he
appeared
natural
walked
as
unconcernedly
as
if
he
were
strolling
for
pleasure
but
the
absence
of
any
other
living
thing
the
silence
the
red
haze
the
surcharged
atmosphere
these
were
all
unnatural
from
time
to
time
stewart
stopped
to
turn
face
forward
toward
houses
and
corners
only
silence
greeted
these
significant
moves
of
his
once
he
halted
to
roll
and
light
another
cigarette
after
that
his
step
quickened
madeline
watched
him
with
pride
love
pain
glory
combating
for
a
mastery
over
her
this
walk
of
his
seemingly
took
longer
than
all
her
hours
of
awakening
of
strife
of
remorse
longer
than
the
ride
to
find
him
she
felt
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
wait
till
he
reached
the
end
of
the
road
yet
in
the
hurry
and
riot
of
her
feelings
she
had
fleeting
panics
what
could
she
say
to
him
how
meet
him
well
she
remembered
the
tall
powerful
form
now
growing
close
enough
to
distinguish
its
dress
stewart
face
was
yet
only
a
dark
gleam
soon
she
would
see
it
long
before
he
could
know
she
was
there
she
wanted
to
run
to
meet
him
nevertheless
she
stood
rooted
to
her
covert
behind
the
window
living
that
terrible
walk
with
him
to
the
uttermost
thought
of
home
sister
mother
sweetheart
wife
life
itself
every
thought
that
could
come
to
a
man
stalking
to
meet
his
executioners
with
all
that
tumult
in
her
mind
and
heart
madeline
still
fell
prey
to
the
incomprehensible
variations
of
emotion
possible
to
a
woman
every
step
stewart
took
thrilled
her
she
had
some
strange
subtle
intuition
that
he
was
not
unhappy
and
that
he
believed
beyond
shadow
of
doubt
that
he
was
walking
to
his
death
his
steps
dragged
a
little
though
they
had
begun
to
be
swift
the
old
hard
physical
wild
nerve
of
the
cowboy
was
perhaps
in
conflict
with
spiritual
growth
of
the
finer
man
realizing
too
late
that
life
ought
not
to
be
sacrificed
then
the
dark
gleam
that
was
his
face
took
shape
grew
sharper
and
clearer
he
was
stalking
now
and
there
was
a
suggestion
of
impatience
in
his
stride
it
took
these
hidden
mexicans
a
long
time
to
kill
him
at
a
point
in
the
middle
of
the
road
even
with
the
corner
of
a
house
and
opposite
to
madeline
position
stewart
halted
he
presented
a
fair
bold
mark
to
his
executioners
and
he
stood
there
motionless
a
full
moment
only
silence
greeted
him
plain
it
was
to
madeline
and
she
thought
to
all
who
had
eyes
to
see
that
to
stewart
since
for
some
reason
he
had
been
spared
all
along
his
walk
this
was
the
moment
when
he
ought
to
be
mercifully
shot
but
as
no
shots
came
a
rugged
dignity
left
him
for
a
reckless
scorn
manifest
in
the
way
he
strolled
across
to
the
corner
of
the
house
rolled
yet
another
cigarette
and
presenting
a
broad
breast
to
the
window
smoked
and
waited
that
wait
was
almost
unendurable
for
madeline
perhaps
it
was
only
a
moment
several
moments
at
the
longest
but
the
time
seemed
a
year
stewart
face
was
scornful
hard
did
he
suspect
treachery
on
the
part
of
his
captors
that
they
meant
to
play
with
him
as
a
cat
with
a
mouse
to
murder
him
at
leisure
madeline
was
sure
she
caught
the
old
inscrutable
mocking
smile
fleeting
across
his
lips
he
held
that
position
for
what
must
have
been
a
reasonable
time
to
his
mind
then
with
a
laugh
and
a
shrug
he
threw
the
cigarette
into
the
road
he
shook
his
head
as
if
at
the
incomprehensible
motives
of
men
who
could
have
no
fair
reasons
now
for
delay
he
made
a
sudden
violent
action
that
was
more
than
a
straightening
of
his
powerful
frame
it
was
the
old
instinctive
violence
then
he
faced
north
madeline
read
his
thought
knew
he
was
thinking
of
her
calling
her
a
last
silent
farewell
he
would
serve
her
to
his
last
breath
leave
her
free
keep
his
secret
that
picture
of
him
strangely
sad
and
strong
sank
indelibly
into
madeline
heart
of
hearts
the
next
instant
he
was
striding
forward
to
force
by
bold
and
scornful
presence
a
speedy
fulfilment
of
his
sentence
madeline
stepped
into
the
door
crossed
the
threshold
stewart
staggered
as
if
indeed
the
bullets
he
expected
had
pierced
him
in
mortal
wound
his
dark
face
turned
white
his
eyes
had
the
rapt
stare
the
wild
fear
of
a
man
who
saw
an
apparition
yet
who
doubted
his
sight
perhaps
he
had
called
to
her
as
the
mexicans
called
to
their
virgin
perhaps
he
imagined
sudden
death
had
come
unawares
and
this
was
her
image
appearing
to
him
in
some
other
life
who
are
you
he
whispered
hoarsely
she
tried
to
lift
her
hands
failed
tried
again
and
held
them
out
trembling
it
is
majesty
your
wife
