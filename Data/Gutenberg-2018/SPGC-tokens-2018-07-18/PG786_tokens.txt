recovered

the
first
chapter
i
the
one
thing
needful
now
what
i
want
is
facts
teach
these
boys
and
girls
nothing
but
facts
facts
alone
are
wanted
in
life
plant
nothing
else
and
root
out
everything
else
you
can
only
form
the
minds
of
reasoning
animals
upon
facts
nothing
else
will
ever
be
of
any
service
to
them
this
is
the
principle
on
which
i
bring
up
my
own
children
and
this
is
the
principle
on
which
i
bring
up
these
children
stick
to
facts
sir
the
scene
was
a
plain
bare
monotonous
vault
of
a
and
the
speaker
s
square
forefinger
emphasized
his
observations
by
underscoring
every
sentence
with
a
line
on
the
schoolmaster
s
sleeve
the
emphasis
was
helped
by
the
speaker
s
square
wall
of
a
forehead
which
had
his
eyebrows
for
its
base
while
his
eyes
found
commodious
cellarage
in
two
dark
caves
overshadowed
by
the
wall
the
emphasis
was
helped
by
the
speaker
s
mouth
which
was
wide
thin
and
hard
set
the
emphasis
was
helped
by
the
speaker
s
voice
which
was
inflexible
dry
and
dictatorial
the
emphasis
was
helped
by
the
speaker
s
hair
which
bristled
on
the
skirts
of
his
bald
head
a
plantation
of
firs
to
keep
the
wind
from
its
shining
surface
all
covered
with
knobs
like
the
crust
of
a
plum
pie
as
if
the
head
had
scarcely
for
the
hard
facts
stored
inside
the
speaker
s
obstinate
carriage
square
coat
square
legs
square
shoulders
his
very
neckcloth
trained
to
take
him
by
the
throat
with
an
unaccommodating
grasp
like
a
stubborn
fact
as
it
was
helped
the
emphasis
in
this
life
we
want
nothing
but
facts
sir
nothing
but
facts
the
speaker
and
the
schoolmaster
and
the
third
grown
person
present
all
backed
a
little
and
swept
with
their
eyes
the
inclined
plane
of
little
vessels
then
and
there
arranged
in
order
ready
to
have
imperial
gallons
of
facts
poured
into
them
until
they
were
full
to
the
brim
chapter

murdering
the
innocents
thomas
gradgrind
sir
a
man
of
realities
a
man
of
facts
and
calculations
a
man
who
proceeds
upon
the
principle
that
two
and
two
are
four
and
nothing
over
and
who
is
not
to
be
talked
into
allowing
for
anything
over
thomas
gradgrind
gradgrind
with
a
rule
and
a
pair
of
scales
and
the
multiplication
table
always
in
his
pocket
sir
ready
to
weigh
and
measure
any
parcel
of
human
nature
and
tell
you
exactly
what
it
comes
to
it
is
a
mere
question
of
figures
a
case
of
simple
arithmetic
you
might
hope
to
get
some
other
nonsensical
belief
into
the
head
of
george
gradgrind
or
augustus
gradgrind
or
john
gradgrind
or
joseph
gradgrind
all
supposititious
persons
but
into
the
head
of
thomas
sir
in
such
terms
gradgrind
always
mentally
introduced
himself
whether
to
his
private
circle
of
acquaintance
or
to
the
public
in
general
in
such
terms
no
doubt
substituting
the
words
boys
and
girls
for
sir
thomas
gradgrind
now
presented
thomas
gradgrind
to
the
little
pitchers
before
him
who
were
to
be
filled
so
full
of
facts
indeed
as
he
eagerly
sparkled
at
them
from
the
cellarage
before
mentioned
he
seemed
a
kind
of
cannon
loaded
to
the
muzzle
with
facts
and
prepared
to
blow
them
clean
out
of
the
regions
of
childhood
at
one
discharge
he
seemed
a
galvanizing
apparatus
too
charged
with
a
grim
mechanical
substitute
for
the
tender
young
imaginations
that
were
to
be
stormed
away
girl
number
twenty
said
gradgrind
squarely
pointing
with
his
square
forefinger
i
don
t
know

girl
who
is
that

standing
up

said
gradgrind

s
father

calls
me
sissy
sir
returned
the
young
girl
in
a
trembling
voice
and
with
another
curtsey
then
he
has
no
business
to
do
it
said
gradgrind
tell
him
he
mustn
t
cecilia
jupe
let
me
see
what
is
your
father
he
belongs
to
the
if
you
please
gradgrind
frowned
and
waved
off
the
objectionable
calling
with
his
hand
we
don
t
want
to
know
anything
about
that
here
you
mustn
t
tell
us
about
that
here
your
father
breaks
horses
don
t
he
if
you
please
sir
when
they
can
get
any
to
break
they
do
break
horses
in
the
ring
you
mustn

about

very
well
then

horsebreaker

well
then
he
is

and
horsebreaker
give
me
your
definition
of
a
sissy
jupe
thrown
into
the
greatest
alarm
by
this
demand
girl
number
twenty
unable
to
define
a
horse
said
gradgrind
for
the
general
behoof
of
all
the
little
pitchers
girl
number
twenty
possessed
of
no
facts
in
reference
to
one
of
the
commonest
of
animals
some
boy
s
definition
of
a
horse
bitzer
the
square
finger
moving
here
and
there
lighted
suddenly
on
bitzer
perhaps
because
he
chanced
to
sit
in
the
same
ray
of
sunlight
which
darting
in
at
one
of
the
bare
windows
of
the
intensely
room
irradiated
sissy
for
the
boys
and
girls
sat
on
the
face
of
the
inclined
plane
in
two
compact
bodies
divided
up
the
centre
by
a
narrow
interval
and
sissy
being
at
the
corner
of
a
row
on
the
sunny
side
came
in
for
the
beginning
of
a
sunbeam
of
which
bitzer
being
at
the
corner
of
a
row
on
the
other
side
a
few
rows
in
advance
caught
the
end
but
whereas
the
girl
was
so
and
that
she
seemed
to
receive
a
deeper
and
more
lustrous
colour
from
the
sun
when
it
shone
upon
her
the
boy
was
so
and
that
the
rays
appeared
to
draw
out
of
him
what
little
colour
he
ever
possessed
his
cold
eyes
would
hardly
have
been
eyes
but
for
the
short
ends
of
lashes
which
by
bringing
them
into
immediate
contrast
with
something
paler
than
themselves
expressed
their
form
his
hair
might
have
been
a
mere
continuation
of
the
sandy
freckles
on
his
forehead
and
face
his
skin
was
so
unwholesomely
deficient
in
the
natural
tinge
that
he
looked
as
though
if
he
were
cut
he
would
bleed
white
bitzer
said
thomas
gradgrind
your
definition
of
a
quadruped
graminivorous
forty
teeth
namely
grinders
four
and
twelve
incisive
sheds
coat
in
the
spring
in
marshy
countries

too
hoofs
hard
but
requiring
to
be
shod
with
iron
age
known
by
marks
in
thus
and
much
more
bitzer
now
girl
number
twenty
said
gradgrind
you
know
what
a
horse
she
curtseyed
again
and
would
have
blushed
deeper
if
she
could
have
blushed
deeper
than
she
had
blushed
all
this
time
bitzer
after
rapidly
blinking
at
thomas
gradgrind
with
both
eyes
at
once
and
so
catching
the
light
upon
his
quivering
ends
of
lashes
that
they
looked
like
the
antenn√¶
of
busy
insects
put
his
knuckles
to
his
freckled
forehead
and
sat
down
again
the
third
gentleman
now
stepped
forth
a
mighty
man
at
cutting
and
drying
he
was
a
government
officer
in
his
way
and
in
most
other
people
s
too
a
professed
pugilist
always
in
training
always
with
a
system
to
force
down
the
general
throat
like
a
bolus
always
to
be
heard
of
at
the
bar
of
his
little
ready
to
fight
all
england
to
continue
in
fistic
phraseology
he
had
a
genius
for
coming
up
to
the
scratch
wherever
and
whatever
it
was
and
proving
himself
an
ugly
customer
he
would
go
in
and
damage
any
subject
whatever
with
his
right
follow
up
with
his
left
stop
exchange
counter
bore
his
opponent
he
always
fought
all
england
to
the
ropes
and
fall
upon
him
neatly
he
was
certain
to
knock
the
wind
out
of
common
sense
and
render
that
unlucky
adversary
deaf
to
the
call
of
time
and
he
had
it
in
charge
from
high
authority
to
bring
about
the
great
millennium
when
commissioners
should
reign
upon
earth
very
well
said
this
gentleman
briskly
smiling
and
folding
his
arms
that
s
a
horse
now
let
me
ask
you
girls
and
boys
would
you
paper
a
room
with
representations
of
horses
after
a
pause
one
half
of
the
children
cried
in
chorus
yes
sir
upon
which
the
other
half
seeing
in
the
gentleman
s
face
that
yes
was
wrong
cried
out
in
chorus
no
sir
the
custom
is
in
these
examinations
of
course
no
why
wouldn
t
you
a
pause
one
corpulent
slow
boy
with
a
wheezy
manner
of
breathing
ventured
the
answer
because
he
wouldn
t
paper
a
room
at
all
but
would
paint
it
you
paper
it
said
the
gentleman
rather
warmly
you
must
paper
it
said
thomas
gradgrind
whether
you
like
it
or
not
don
t
tell
you
wouldn
t
paper
it
what
do
you
mean
boy
i
ll
explain
to
you
then
said
the
gentleman
after
another
and
a
dismal
pause
why
you
wouldn
t
paper
a
room
with
representations
of
horses
do
you
ever
see
horses
walking
up
and
down
the
sides
of
rooms
in
fact
do
you
yes
sir
from
one
half
no
sir
from
the
other
of
course
no
said
the
gentleman
with
an
indignant
look
at
the
wrong
half
why
then
you
are
not
to
see
anywhere
what
you
don
t
see
in
fact
you
are
not
to
have
anywhere
what
you
don
t
have
in
fact
what
is
called
taste
is
only
another
name
for
thomas
gradgrind
nodded
his
approbation
this
is
a
new
principle
a
discovery
a
great
discovery
said
the
gentleman
now
i
ll
try
you
again
suppose
you
were
going
to
carpet
a
room
would
you
use
a
carpet
having
a
representation
of
flowers
upon
it
there
being
a
general
conviction
by
this
time
that
no
sir
was
always
the
right
answer
to
this
gentleman
the
chorus
of
no
was
very
strong
only
a
few
feeble
stragglers
said
yes
among
them
sissy
jupe
girl
number
twenty
said
the
gentleman
smiling
in
the
calm
strength
of
knowledge
sissy
blushed
and
stood
up
so
you
would
carpet
your
your
husband
s
room
if
you
were
a
grown
woman
and
had
a
representations
of
flowers
would
you
said
the
gentleman
why
would
you
if
you
please
sir
i
am
very
fond
of
flowers
returned
the
girl
and
is
that
why
you
would
put
tables
and
chairs
upon
them
and
have
people
walking
over
them
with
heavy
boots
it
wouldn
t
hurt
them
sir
they
wouldn
t
crush
and
wither
if
you
please
sir
they
would
be
the
pictures
of
what
was
very
pretty
and
pleasant
and
i
would
ay
ay
ay
but
you
mustn
t
fancy
cried
the
gentleman
quite
elated
by
coming
so
happily
to
his
point
that
s
it
you
are
never
to
you
are
not
cecilia
jupe
thomas
gradgrind
solemnly
repeated
to
do
anything
of
that
fact
fact
fact
said
the
gentleman
and
fact
fact
fact
repeated
thomas
gradgrind
you
are
to
be
in
all
things
regulated
and
governed
said
the
gentleman
by
fact
we
hope
to
have
before
long
a
board
of
fact
composed
of
commissioners
of
fact
who
will
force
the
people
to
be
a
people
of
fact
and
of
nothing
but
fact
you
must
discard
the
word
fancy
altogether
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
are
not
to
have
in
any
object
of
use
or
ornament
what
would
be
a
contradiction
in
fact
you
don
t
walk
upon
flowers
in
fact
you
can
not
be
allowed
to
walk
upon
flowers
in
carpets
you
don
t
find
that
foreign
birds
and
butterflies
come
and
perch
upon
your
crockery
you
can
not
be
permitted
to
paint
foreign
birds
and
butterflies
upon
your
crockery
you
never
meet
with
quadrupeds
going
up
and
down
walls
you
must
not
have
quadrupeds
represented
upon
walls
you
must
use
said
the
gentleman
for
all
these
purposes
combinations
and
modifications
in
primary
colours
of
mathematical
figures
which
are
susceptible
of
proof
and
demonstration
this
is
the
new
discovery
this
is
fact
this
is
the
girl
curtseyed
and
sat
down
she
was
very
young
and
she
looked
as
if
she
were
frightened
by
the
prospect
the
world
afforded
now
if
m
choakumchild
said
the
gentleman
will
proceed
to
give
his
first
lesson
here
gradgrind
i
shall
be
happy
at
your
request
to
observe
his
mode
of
gradgrind
was
much
obliged
mr
m
choakumchild
we
only
wait
for
so
m
choakumchild
began
in
his
best
manner
he
and
some
one
hundred
and
forty
other
schoolmasters
had
been
lately
turned
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
factory
on
the
same
principles
like
so
many
pianoforte
legs
he
had
been
put
through
an
immense
variety
of
paces
and
had
answered
volumes
of
questions
orthography
etymology
syntax
and
prosody
biography
astronomy
geography
and
general
cosmography
the
sciences
of
compound
proportion
algebra
and
levelling
vocal
music
and
drawing
from
models
were
all
at
the
ends
of
his
ten
chilled
fingers
he
had
worked
his
stony
way
into
her
majesty
s
most
honourable
privy
council
s
schedule
b
and
had
taken
the
bloom
off
the
higher
branches
of
mathematics
and
physical
science
french
german
latin
and
greek
he
knew
all
about
all
the
water
sheds
of
all
the
world
whatever
they
are
and
all
the
histories
of
all
the
peoples
and
all
the
names
of
all
the
rivers
and
mountains
and
all
the
productions
manners
and
customs
of
all
the
countries
and
all
their
boundaries
and
bearings
on
the
two
and
thirty
points
of
the
compass
ah
rather
overdone
m
choakumchild
if
he
had
only
learnt
a
little
less
how
infinitely
better
he
might
have
taught
much
more
he
went
to
work
in
this
preparatory
lesson
not
unlike
morgiana
in
the
forty
thieves
looking
into
all
the
vessels
ranged
before
him
one
after
another
to
see
what
they
contained
say
good
m
choakumchild
when
from
thy
boiling
store
thou
shalt
fill
each
jar
brim
full
dost
thou
think
that
thou
wilt
always
kill
outright
the
robber
fancy
lurking
sometimes
only
maim
him
and
distort
him
chapter
iii
a
loophole
gradgrind
walked
homeward
from
the
school
in
a
state
of
considerable
satisfaction
it
was
his
school
and
he
intended
it
to
be
a
model
he
intended
every
child
in
it
to
be
a
as
the
young
gradgrinds
were
all
models
there
were
five
young
gradgrinds
and
they
were
models
every
one
they
had
been
lectured
at
from
their
tenderest
years
coursed
like
little
hares
almost
as
soon
as
they
could
run
alone
they
had
been
made
to
run
to
the
the
first
object
with
which
they
had
an
association
or
of
which
they
had
a
remembrance
was
a
large
black
board
with
a
dry
ogre
chalking
ghastly
white
figures
on
it
not
that
they
knew
by
name
or
nature
anything
about
an
ogre
fact
forbid
i
only
use
the
word
to
express
a
monster
in
a
lecturing
castle
with
heaven
knows
how
many
heads
manipulated
into
one
taking
childhood
captive
and
dragging
it
into
gloomy
statistical
dens
by
the
hair
no
little
gradgrind
had
ever
seen
a
face
in
the
moon
it
was
up
in
the
moon
before
it
could
speak
distinctly
no
little
gradgrind
had
ever
learnt
the
silly
jingle
twinkle
twinkle
little
star
how
i
wonder
what
you
are
no
little
gradgrind
had
ever
known
wonder
on
the
subject
each
little
gradgrind
having
at
five
years
old
dissected
the
great
bear
like
a
professor
owen
and
driven
charles
s
wain
like
a
locomotive
no
little
gradgrind
had
ever
associated
a
cow
in
a
field
with
that
famous
cow
with
the
crumpled
horn
who
tossed
the
dog
who
worried
the
cat
who
killed
the
rat
who
ate
the
malt
or
with
that
yet
more
famous
cow
who
swallowed
tom
thumb
it
had
never
heard
of
those
celebrities
and
had
only
been
introduced
to
a
cow
as
a
graminivorous
ruminating
quadruped
with
several
stomachs
to
his
home
which
was
called
stone
lodge
gradgrind
directed
his
steps
he
had
virtually
retired
from
the
wholesale
hardware
trade
before
he
built
stone
lodge
and
was
now
looking
about
for
a
suitable
opportunity
of
making
an
arithmetical
figure
in
parliament
stone
lodge
was
situated
on
a
moor
within
a
mile
or
two
of
a
great
coketown
in
the
present
faithful
a
very
regular
feature
on
the
face
of
the
country
stone
lodge
was
not
the
least
disguise
toned
down
or
shaded
off
that
uncompromising
fact
in
the
landscape
a
great
square
house
with
a
heavy
portico
darkening
the
principal
windows
as
its
master
s
heavy
brows
overshadowed
his
eyes
a
calculated
cast
up
balanced
and
proved
house
six
windows
on
this
side
of
the
door
six
on
that
side
a
total
of
twelve
in
this
wing
a
total
of
twelve
in
the
other
wing
carried
over
to
the
back
wings
a
lawn
and
garden
and
an
infant
avenue
all
ruled
straight
like
a
botanical
gas
and
ventilation
drainage
and
all
of
the
primest
quality
iron
clamps
and
girders
from
top
to
bottom
mechanical
lifts
for
the
housemaids
with
all
their
brushes
and
brooms
everything
that
heart
could
desire
everything
well
i
suppose
so
the
little
gradgrinds
had
cabinets
in
various
departments
of
science
too
they
had
a
little
conchological
cabinet
and
a
little
metallurgical
cabinet
and
a
little
mineralogical
cabinet
and
the
specimens
were
all
arranged
and
labelled
and
the
bits
of
stone
and
ore
looked
as
though
they
might
have
been
broken
from
the
parent
substances
by
those
tremendously
hard
instruments
their
own
names
and
to
paraphrase
the
idle
legend
of
peter
piper
who
had
never
found
his
way
into
their
nursery
if
the
greedy
little
gradgrinds
grasped
at
more
than
this
what
was
it
for
good
gracious
goodness
sake
that
the
greedy
little
gradgrinds
grasped
it
their
father
walked
on
in
a
hopeful
and
satisfied
frame
of
mind
he
was
an
affectionate
father
after
his
manner
but
he
would
probably
have
described
himself
if
he
had
been
put
like
sissy
jupe
upon
a
definition
as
an
eminently
practical
father
he
had
a
particular
pride
in
the
phrase
eminently
practical
which
was
considered
to
have
a
special
application
to
him
whatsoever
the
public
meeting
held
in
coketown
and
whatsoever
the
subject
of
such
meeting
some
coketowner
was
sure
to
seize
the
occasion
of
alluding
to
his
eminently
practical
friend
gradgrind
this
always
pleased
the
eminently
practical
friend
he
knew
it
to
be
his
due
but
his
due
was
acceptable
he
had
reached
the
neutral
ground
upon
the
outskirts
of
the
town
which
was
neither
town
nor
country
and
yet
was
either
spoiled
when
his
ears
were
invaded
by
the
sound
of
music
the
clashing
and
banging
band
attached
to
the
establishment
which
had
there
set
up
its
rest
in
a
wooden
pavilion
was
in
full
bray
a
flag
floating
from
the
summit
of
the

among
the
other
pleasing
but
always
strictly
moral
wonders
which
must
be
seen
to
be

signor
jupe
was
that
afternoon
to
elucidate
the
diverting
accomplishments
of
his
highly
trained
performing
dog
he
was
also
to
exhibit
his
astounding
feat
of
throwing
in
rapid
succession
backhanded
over
his
head
thus
forming
a
fountain
of
solid
iron
in
a
feat
never
before
attempted
in
this
or
any
other
country
and
which
having
elicited
such
rapturous
plaudits
from
enthusiastic
throngs
it
can
not
be
the
same
signor
jupe
was
to
enliven
the
varied
performances
at
frequent
intervals
with
his
chaste
shaksperean
quips
and
lastly
he
was
to
wind
them
up
by
appearing
in
his
favourite
character
of
william
button
of
tooley
street
in
the
highly
novel
and
laughable
of
the
tailor
s
journey
to
thomas
gradgrind
took
no
heed
of
these
trivialities
of
course
but
passed
on
as
a
practical
man
ought
to
pass
on
either
brushing
the
noisy
insects
from
his
thoughts
or
consigning
them
to
the
house
of
correction
but
the
turning
of
the
road
took
him
by
the
back
of
the
booth
and
at
the
back
of
the
booth
a
number
of
children
were
congregated
in
a
number
of
stealthy
attitudes
striving
to
peep
in
at
the
hidden
glories
of
the
place
this
brought
him
to
a
stop
now
to
think
of
these
vagabonds
said
he
attracting
the
young
rabble
from
a
model
a
space
of
stunted
grass
and
dry
rubbish
being
between
him
and
the
young
rabble
he
took
his
eyeglass
out
of
his
waistcoat
to
look
for
any
child
he
knew
by
name
and
might
order
off
phenomenon
almost
incredible
though
distinctly
seen
what
did
he
then
behold
but
his
own
metallurgical
louisa
peeping
with
all
her
might
through
a
hole
in
a
deal
board
and
his
own
mathematical
thomas
abasing
himself
on
the
ground
to
catch
but
a
hoof
of
the
graceful
equestrian
tyrolean
dumb
with
amazement
gradgrind
crossed
to
the
spot
where
his
family
was
thus
disgraced
laid
his
hand
upon
each
erring
child
and
said
louisa
thomas
both
rose
red
and
disconcerted
but
louisa
looked
at
her
father
with
more
boldness
than
thomas
did
indeed
thomas
did
not
look
at
him
but
gave
himself
up
to
be
taken
home
like
a
machine
in
the
name
of
wonder
idleness
and
folly
said
gradgrind
leading
each
away
by
a
hand
what
do
you
do
here
wanted
to
see
what
it
was
like
returned
louisa
shortly
what
it
was
like
yes
there
was
an
air
of
jaded
sullenness
in
them
both
and
particularly
in
the
girl
yet
struggling
through
the
dissatisfaction
of
her
face
there
was
a
light
with
nothing
to
rest
upon
a
fire
with
nothing
to
burn
a
starved
imagination
keeping
life
in
itself
somehow
which
brightened
its
expression
not
with
the
brightness
natural
to
cheerful
youth
but
with
uncertain
eager
doubtful
flashes
which
had
something
painful
in
them
analogous
to
the
changes
on
a
blind
face
groping
its
way
she
was
a
child
now
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
but
at
no
distant
day
would
seem
to
become
a
woman
all
at
once
her
father
thought
so
as
he
looked
at
her
she
was
pretty
would
have
been
he
thought
in
his
eminently
practical
way
but
for
her
thomas
though
i
have
the
fact
before
me
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
you
with
your
education
and
resources
should
have
brought
your
sister
to
a
scene
like
i
brought
father
said
louisa
quickly
i
asked
him
to
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
i
am
very
sorry
indeed
to
hear
it
it
makes
thomas
no
better
and
it
makes
you
worse
she
looked
at
her
father
again
but
no
tear
fell
down
her
cheek
you
thomas
and
you
to
whom
the
circle
of
the
sciences
is
open
thomas
and
you
who
may
be
said
to
be
replete
with
facts
thomas
and
you
who
have
been
trained
to
mathematical
exactness
thomas
and
you
here
cried
gradgrind
in
this
degraded
position
i
am
i
was
tired
father
i
have
been
tired
a
long
time
said
louisa
tired
of
what
asked
the
astonished
father
i
don
t
know
of
everything
i
say
not
another
word
returned
gradgrind
you
are
childish
i
will
hear
no
he
did
not
speak
again
until
they
had
walked
some
in
silence
when
he
gravely
broke
out
with
what
would
your
best
friends
say
louisa
do
you
attach
no
value
to
their
good
opinion
what
would
bounderby
say
at
the
mention
of
this
name
his
daughter
stole
a
look
at
him
remarkable
for
its
intense
and
searching
character
he
saw
nothing
of
it
for
before
he
looked
at
her
she
had
again
cast
down
her
eyes
what
he
repeated
presently
would
bounderby
say
all
the
way
to
stone
lodge
as
with
grave
indignation
he
led
the
two
delinquents
home
he
repeated
at
intervals
what
would
bounderby
say
if
bounderby
had
been
grundy
chapter
iv
bounderby
not
being
grundy
who
bounderby
why
bounderby
was
as
near
being
gradgrind
s
bosom
friend
as
a
man
perfectly
devoid
of
sentiment
can
approach
that
spiritual
relationship
towards
another
man
perfectly
devoid
of
sentiment
so
near
was
if
the
reader
should
prefer
it
so
far
off
he
was
a
rich
man
banker
merchant
manufacturer
and
what
not
a
big
loud
man
with
a
stare
and
a
metallic
laugh
a
man
made
out
of
a
coarse
material
which
seemed
to
have
been
stretched
to
make
so
much
of
him
a
man
with
a
great
puffed
head
and
forehead
swelled
veins
in
his
temples
and
such
a
strained
skin
to
his
face
that
it
seemed
to
hold
his
eyes
open
and
lift
his
eyebrows
up
a
man
with
a
pervading
appearance
on
him
of
being
inflated
like
a
balloon
and
ready
to
start
a
man
who
could
never
sufficiently
vaunt
himself
a
man
a
man
who
was
always
proclaiming
through
that
brassy
of
a
voice
of
his
his
old
ignorance
and
his
old
poverty
a
man
who
was
the
bully
of
humility
a
year
or
two
younger
than
his
eminently
practical
friend
bounderby
looked
older
his
seven
or
eight
and
forty
might
have
had
the
seven
or
eight
added
to
it
again
without
surprising
anybody
he
had
not
much
hair
one
might
have
fancied
he
had
talked
it
off
and
that
what
was
left
all
standing
up
in
disorder
was
in
that
condition
from
being
constantly
blown
about
by
his
windy
boastfulness
in
the
formal
of
stone
lodge
standing
on
the
hearthrug
warming
himself
before
the
fire
bounderby
delivered
some
observations
to
gradgrind
on
the
circumstance
of
its
being
his
birthday
he
stood
before
the
fire
partly
because
it
was
a
cool
spring
afternoon
though
the
sun
shone
partly
because
the
shade
of
stone
lodge
was
always
haunted
by
the
ghost
of
damp
mortar
partly
because
he
thus
took
up
a
commanding
position
from
which
to
subdue
gradgrind
i
hadn
t
a
shoe
to
my
foot
as
to
a
stocking
i
didn
t
know
such
a
thing
by
name
i
passed
the
day
in
a
ditch
and
the
night
in
a
pigsty
that
s
the
way
i
spent
my
tenth
birthday
not
that
a
ditch
was
new
to
me
for
i
was
born
in
a
gradgrind
a
little
thin
white
bundle
of
shawls
of
surpassing
feebleness
mental
and
bodily
who
was
always
taking
physic
without
any
effect
and
who
whenever
she
showed
a
symptom
of
coming
to
life
was
invariably
stunned
by
some
weighty
piece
of
fact
tumbling
on
her
gradgrind
hoped
it
was
a
dry
ditch
no
as
wet
as
a
sop
a
foot
of
water
in
it
said
bounderby
enough
to
give
a
baby
cold
gradgrind
considered
cold
i
was
born
with
inflammation
of
the
lungs
and
of
everything
else
i
believe
that
was
capable
of
inflammation
returned
bounderby
for
years
ma
am
i
was
one
of
the
most
miserable
little
wretches
ever
seen
i
was
so
sickly
that
i
was
always
moaning
and
groaning
i
was
so
ragged
and
dirty
that
you
wouldn
t
have
touched
me
with
a
pair
of
gradgrind
faintly
looked
at
the
tongs
as
the
most
appropriate
thing
her
imbecility
could
think
of
doing
how
i
fought
through
it
don
t
know
said
bounderby
i
was
determined
i
suppose
i
have
been
a
determined
character
in
later
life
and
i
suppose
i
was
then
here
i
am
gradgrind
anyhow
and
nobody
to
thank
for
my
being
here
but
gradgrind
meekly
and
weakly
hoped
that
his
mother
bolted
ma
am
said
bounderby
gradgrind
stunned
as
usual
collapsed
and
gave
it
up
my
mother
left
me
to
my
grandmother
said
bounderby
and
according
to
the
best
of
my
remembrance
my
grandmother
was
the
wickedest
and
the
worst
old
woman
that
ever
lived
if
i
got
a
little
pair
of
shoes
by
any
chance
she
would
take
em
off
and
sell
em
for
drink
why
i
have
known
that
grandmother
of
mine
lie
in
her
bed
and
drink
her
glasses
of
liquor
before
breakfast
gradgrind
weakly
smiling
and
giving
no
other
sign
of
vitality
looked
as
she
always
did
like
an
indifferently
executed
transparency
of
a
small
female
figure
without
enough
light
behind
it
she
kept
a
chandler
s
shop
pursued
bounderby
and
kept
me
in
an
that
was
the
cot
of
infancy
an
old
as
soon
as
i
was
big
enough
to
run
away
of
course
i
ran
away
then
i
became
a
young
vagabond
and
instead
of
one
old
woman
knocking
me
about
and
starving
me
everybody
of
all
ages
knocked
me
about
and
starved
me
they
were
right
they
had
no
business
to
do
anything
else
i
was
a
nuisance
an
incumbrance
and
a
pest
i
know
that
very
his
pride
in
having
at
any
time
of
his
life
achieved
such
a
great
social
distinction
as
to
be
a
nuisance
an
incumbrance
and
a
pest
was
only
to
be
satisfied
by
three
sonorous
repetitions
of
the
boast
i
was
to
pull
through
it
i
suppose
gradgrind
whether
i
was
to
do
it
or
not

mind
to
say
i
wish
i
hadn
t
what
would
you
have
done
i
should
like
to
know
gradgrind
did
not
seem
favourably
impressed
by
these
cogent
remarks
he
frowned
impatiently
as
if
with
my
head
in
its
present
throbbing
state
you
couldn
t
go
and
look
at
the
shells
and
minerals
and
things
provided
for
you
instead
of
circuses
said
gradgrind
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
no
young
people
have
circus
masters
or
keep
circuses
in
cabinets
or
attend
lectures
about
circuses
what
can
you
possibly
want
to
know
of
circuses
then
i
am
sure
you
have
enough
to
do
if
that
s
what
you
want
with
my
head
in
its
present
state
i
couldn
t
remember
the
mere
names
of
half
the
facts
you
have
got
to
attend
that
s
the
reason
pouted
louisa
don
t
tell
me
that
s
the
reason
because
it
can
t
be
nothing
of
the
sort
said
gradgrind
go
and
be
somethingological
gradgrind
was
not
a
scientific
character
and
usually
dismissed
her
children
to
their
studies
with
this
general
injunction
to
choose
their
pursuit
in
truth
gradgrind
s
stock
of
facts
in
general
was
woefully
defective
but
gradgrind
in
raising
her
to
her
high
matrimonial
position
had
been
influenced
by
two
reasons
firstly
she
was
most
satisfactory
as
a
question
of
figures
and
secondly
she
had
no
nonsense
about
her
by
nonsense
he
meant
fancy
and
truly
it
is
probable
she
was
as
free
from
any
alloy
of
that
nature
as
any
human
being
not
arrived
at
the
perfection
of
an
absolute
idiot
ever
was
the
simple
circumstance
of
being
left
alone
with
her
husband
and
bounderby
was
sufficient
to
stun
this
admirable
lady
again
without
collision
between
herself
and
any
other
fact
so
she
once
more
died
away
and
nobody
minded
her
bounderby
said
gradgrind
drawing
a
chair
to
the
fireside
you
are
always
so
interested
in
my
young
in
i
make
no
apology
for
saying
to
you
i
am
very
much
vexed
by
this
discovery
i
have
systematically
devoted
myself
as
you
know
to
the
education
of
the
reason
of
my
family
the
reason
is
as
you
know
the
only
faculty
to
which
education
should
be
addressed
and
yet
bounderby
it
would
appear
from
this
unexpected
circumstance
of
though
in
itself
a
trifling
one
as
if
something
had
crept
into
thomas
s
and
louisa
s
minds
which
rather
which
is
don
t
know
that
i
can
express
myself
better
than
by
has
never
been
intended
to
be
developed
and
in
which
their
reason
has
no
there
certainly
is
no
reason
in
looking
with
interest
at
a
parcel
of
vagabonds
returned
bounderby
when
i
was
a
vagabond
myself
nobody
looked
with
any
interest
at
i
know
then
comes
the
question
said
the
eminently
practical
father
with
his
eyes
on
the
fire
in
what
has
this
vulgar
curiosity
its
rise
i
ll
tell
you
in
what
in
idle
i
hope
not
said
the
eminently
practical
i
confess
however
that
the
misgiving
crossed
me
on
my
way
in
idle
imagination
gradgrind
repeated
bounderby
a
very
bad
thing
for
anybody
but
a
cursed
bad
thing
for
a
girl
like
louisa
i
should
ask
gradgrind
s
pardon
for
strong
expressions
but
that
she
knows
very
well
i
am
not
a
refined
character
whoever
expects
refinement
in
will
be
disappointed
i
hadn
t
a
refined
bringing
whether
said
gradgrind
pondering
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
cavernous
eyes
on
the
fire
whether
any
instructor
or
servant
can
have
suggested
anything
whether
louisa
or
thomas
can
have
been
reading
anything
whether
in
spite
of
all
precautions
any
idle
can
have
got
into
the
house
because
in
minds
that
have
been
practically
formed
by
rule
and
line
from
the
cradle
upwards
this
is
so
curious
so
stop
a
bit
cried
bounderby
who
all
this
time
had
been
standing
as
before
on
the
hearth
bursting
at
the
very
furniture
of
the
room
with
explosive
humility
you
have
one
of
those
strollers
children
in
the
cecilia
jupe
by
name
said
gradgrind
with
something
of
a
stricken
look
at
his
friend
now
stop
a
bit
cried
bounderby
again
how
did
she
come
there
why
the
fact
is
i
saw
the
girl
myself
for
the
first
time
only
just
now
she
specially
applied
here
at
the
house
to
be
admitted
as
not
regularly
belonging
to
our
town
you
are
right
bounderby
you
are
now
stop
a
bit
cried
bounderby
once
more
louisa
saw
her
when
she
came
louisa
certainly
did
see
her
for
she
mentioned
the
application
to
me
but
louisa
saw
her
i
have
no
doubt
in
gradgrind
s
pray
gradgrind
said
bounderby
what
passed
oh
my
poor
health
returned
gradgrind
the
girl
wanted
to
come
to
the
school
and
gradgrind
wanted
girls
to
come
to
the
school
and
louisa
and
thomas
both
said
that
the
girl
wanted
to
come
and
that
gradgrind
wanted
girls
to
come
and
how
was
it
possible
to
contradict
them
when
such
was
the
fact
now
i
tell
you
what
gradgrind
said
bounderby
turn
this
girl
to
the
right
about
and
there
s
an
end
of
i
am
much
of
your
do
it
at
once
said
bounderby
has
always
been
my
motto
from
a
child
when
i
thought
i
would
run
away
from
my
and
my
grandmother
i
did
it
at
once
do
you
the
same
do
this
at
once
are
you
walking
asked
his
friend
i
have
the
father
s
address
perhaps
you
would
not
mind
walking
to
town
with
me
not
the
least
in
the
world
said
bounderby
as
long
as
you
do
it
at
once
so
bounderby
threw
on
his
always
threw
it
on
as
expressing
a
man
who
had
been
far
too
busily
employed
in
making
himself
to
acquire
any
fashion
of
wearing
his
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
sauntered
out
into
the
hall
i
never
wear
gloves
it
was
his
custom
to
say
i
didn
t
climb
up
the
ladder
in
t
be
so
high
up
if
i
being
left
to
saunter
in
the
hall
a
minute
or
two
while
gradgrind
went
for
the
address
he
opened
the
door
of
the
children
s
study
and
looked
into
that
serene
apartment
which
notwithstanding
its
and
its
cabinets
and
its
variety
of
learned
and
philosophical
appliances
had
much
of
the
genial
aspect
of
a
room
devoted
to
louisa
languidly
leaned
upon
the
window
looking
out
without
looking
at
anything
while
young
thomas
stood
sniffing
revengefully
at
the
fire
adam
smith
and
malthus
two
younger
gradgrinds
were
out
at
lecture
in
custody
and
little
jane
after
manufacturing
a
good
deal
of
moist
on
her
face
with
and
tears
had
fallen
asleep
over
vulgar
fractions
it
s
all
right
now
louisa
it
s
all
right
young
thomas
said
bounderby
you
won
t
do
so
any
more
i
ll
answer
for
it
s
being
all
over
with
father
well
louisa
that
s
worth
a
kiss
isn
t
it
you
can
take
one
bounderby
returned
louisa
when
she
had
coldly
paused
and
slowly
walked
across
the
room
and
ungraciously
raised
her
cheek
towards
him
with
her
face
turned
away
always
my
pet
ain
t
you
louisa
said
bounderby
louisa
he
went
his
way
but
she
stood
on
the
same
spot
rubbing
the
cheek
he
had
kissed
with
her
handkerchief
until
it
was
burning
red
she
was
still
doing
this
five
minutes
afterwards
what
are
you
about
loo
her
brother
sulkily
remonstrated
you
ll
rub
a
hole
in
your
you
may
cut
the
piece
out
with
your
penknife
if
you
like
tom
i
wouldn
t
cry
chapter
v
the
keynote
coketown
to
which
bounderby
and
gradgrind
now
walked
was
a
triumph
of
fact
it
had
no
greater
taint
of
fancy
in
it
than
gradgrind
herself
let
us
strike
the
coketown
before
pursuing
our
tune
it
was
a
town
of
red
brick
or
of
brick
that
would
have
been
red
if
the
smoke
and
ashes
had
allowed
it
but
as
matters
stood
it
was
a
town
of
unnatural
red
and
black
like
the
painted
face
of
a
savage
it
was
a
town
of
machinery
and
tall
chimneys
out
of
which
interminable
serpents
of
smoke
trailed
themselves
for
ever
and
ever
and
never
got
uncoiled
it
had
a
black
canal
in
it
and
a
river
that
ran
purple
with
dye
and
vast
piles
of
building
full
of
windows
where
there
was
a
rattling
and
a
trembling
all
day
long
and
where
the
piston
of
the
worked
monotonously
up
and
down
like
the
head
of
an
elephant
in
a
state
of
melancholy
madness
it
contained
several
large
streets
all
very
like
one
another
and
many
small
streets
still
more
like
one
another
inhabited
by
people
equally
like
one
another
who
all
went
in
and
out
at
the
same
hours
with
the
same
sound
upon
the
same
pavements
to
do
the
same
work
and
to
whom
every
day
was
the
same
as
yesterday
and
and
every
year
the
counterpart
of
the
last
and
the
next
these
attributes
of
coketown
were
in
the
main
inseparable
from
the
work
by
which
it
was
sustained
against
them
were
to
be
set
off
comforts
of
life
which
found
their
way
all
over
the
world
and
elegancies
of
life
which
made
we
will
not
ask
how
much
of
the
fine
lady
who
could
scarcely
bear
to
hear
the
place
mentioned
the
rest
of
its
features
were
voluntary
and
they
were
these
you
saw
nothing
in
coketown
but
what
was
severely
workful
if
the
members
of
a
religious
persuasion
built
a
chapel
the
members
of
eighteen
religious
persuasions
had
made
it
a
pious
warehouse
of
red
brick
with
sometimes
but
this
is
only
in
highly
ornamental
examples
a
bell
in
a
birdcage
on
the
top
of
it
the
solitary
exception
was
the
new
church
a
stuccoed
edifice
with
a
square
steeple
over
the
door
terminating
in
four
short
pinnacles
like
florid
wooden
legs
all
the
public
inscriptions
in
the
town
were
painted
alike
in
severe
characters
of
black
and
white
the
jail
might
have
been
the
infirmary
the
infirmary
might
have
been
the
jail
the
might
have
been
either
or
both
or
anything
else
for
anything
that
appeared
to
the
contrary
in
the
graces
of
their
construction
fact
fact
fact
everywhere
in
the
material
aspect
of
the
town
fact
fact
fact
everywhere
in
the
immaterial
the
m
choakumchild
school
was
all
fact
and
the
school
of
design
was
all
fact
and
the
relations
between
master
and
man
were
all
fact
and
everything
was
fact
between
the
hospital
and
the
cemetery
and
what
you
couldn
t
state
in
figures
or
show
to
be
purchaseable
in
the
cheapest
market
and
saleable
in
the
dearest
was
not
and
never
should
be
world
without
end
amen
a
town
so
sacred
to
fact
and
so
triumphant
in
its
assertion
of
course
got
on
well
why
no
not
quite
well
no
dear
me
no
coketown
did
not
come
out
of
its
own
furnaces
in
all
respects
like
gold
that
had
stood
the
fire
first
the
perplexing
mystery
of
the
place
was
who
belonged
to
the
eighteen
denominations
because
whoever
did
the
labouring
people
did
not
it
was
very
strange
to
walk
through
the
streets
on
a
sunday
morning
and
note
how
few
of
the
barbarous
jangling
of
bells
that
was
driving
the
sick
and
nervous
mad
called
away
from
their
own
quarter
from
their
own
close
rooms
from
the
corners
of
their
own
streets
where
they
lounged
listlessly
gazing
at
all
the
church
and
chapel
going
as
at
a
thing
with
which
they
had
no
manner
of
concern
nor
was
it
merely
the
stranger
who
noticed
this
because
there
was
a
native
organization
in
coketown
itself
whose
members
were
to
be
heard
of
in
the
house
of
commons
every
session
indignantly
petitioning
for
acts
of
parliament
that
should
make
these
people
religious
by
main
force
then
came
the
teetotal
society
who
complained
that
these
same
people
get
drunk
and
showed
in
tabular
statements
that
they
did
get
drunk
and
proved
at
tea
parties
that
no
inducement
human
or
divine
except
a
medal
would
induce
them
to
forego
their
custom
of
getting
drunk
then
came
the
chemist
and
druggist
with
other
tabular
statements
showing
that
when
they
didn
t
get
drunk
they
took
opium
then
came
the
experienced
chaplain
of
the
jail
with
more
tabular
statements
outdoing
all
the
previous
tabular
statements
and
showing
that
the
same
people
resort
to
low
haunts
hidden
from
the
public
eye
where
they
heard
low
singing
and
saw
low
dancing
and
mayhap
joined
in
it
and
where
a
aged
next
birthday
and
committed
for
eighteen
months
solitary
had
himself
said
not
that
he
had
ever
shown
himself
particularly
worthy
of
belief
his
ruin
began
as
he
was
perfectly
sure
and
confident
that
otherwise
he
would
have
been
a
moral
specimen
then
came
gradgrind
and
bounderby
the
two
gentlemen
at
this
present
moment
walking
through
coketown
and
both
eminently
practical
who
could
on
occasion
furnish
more
tabular
statements
derived
from
their
own
personal
experience
and
illustrated
by
cases
they
had
known
and
seen
from
which
it
clearly
short
it
was
the
only
clear
thing
in
the
these
same
people
were
a
bad
lot
altogether
gentlemen
that
do
what
you
would
for
them
they
were
never
thankful
for
it
gentlemen
that
they
were
restless
gentlemen
that
they
never
knew
what
they
wanted
that
they
lived
upon
the
best
and
bought
fresh
butter
and
insisted
on
mocha
coffee
and
rejected
all
but
prime
parts
of
meat
and
yet
were
eternally
dissatisfied
and
unmanageable
in
short
it
was
the
moral
of
the
old
nursery
fable
there
was
an
old
woman
and
what
do
you
think
she
lived
upon
nothing
but
victuals
and
drink
victuals
and
drink
were
the
whole
of
her
diet
and
yet
this
old
woman
would
never
be
quiet
is
it
possible
i
wonder
that
there
was
any
analogy
between
the
case
of
the
coketown
population
and
the
case
of
the
little
gradgrinds
surely
none
of
us
in
our
sober
senses
and
acquainted
with
figures
are
to
be
told
at
this
time
of
day
that
one
of
the
foremost
elements
in
the
existence
of
the
coketown
had
been
for
scores
of
years
deliberately
set
at
nought
that
there
was
any
fancy
in
them
demanding
to
be
brought
into
healthy
existence
instead
of
struggling
on
in
convulsions
that
exactly
in
the
ratio
as
they
worked
long
and
monotonously
the
craving
grew
within
them
for
some
physical
relaxation
encouraging
good
humour
and
good
spirits
and
giving
them
a
recognized
holiday
though
it
were
but
for
an
honest
dance
to
a
stirring
band
of
occasional
light
pie
in
which
even
m
choakumchild
had
no
craving
must
and
would
be
satisfied
aright
or
must
and
would
inevitably
go
wrong
until
the
laws
of
the
creation
were
repealed
this
man
lives
at
pod
s
end
and
i
don
t
quite
know
pod
s
end
said
gradgrind
which
is
it
bounderby
bounderby
knew
it
was
somewhere
down
town
but
knew
no
more
respecting
it
so
they
stopped
for
a
moment
looking
about
almost
as
they
did
so
there
came
running
round
the
corner
of
the
street
at
a
quick
pace
and
with
a
frightened
look
a
girl
whom
gradgrind
recognized
halloa
said
he
stop
where
are
you
going
stop
girl
number
twenty
stopped
then
palpitating
and
made
him
a
curtsey
why
are
you
tearing
about
the
streets
said
gradgrind
in
this
improper
manner
i
was
run
after
sir
the
girl
panted
and
i
wanted
to
get
run
after
repeated
gradgrind
who
would
run
after
the
question
was
unexpectedly
and
suddenly
answered
for
her
by
the
colourless
boy
bitzer
who
came
round
the
corner
with
such
blind
speed
and
so
little
anticipating
a
stoppage
on
the
pavement
that
he
brought
himself
up
against
gradgrind
s
waistcoat
and
rebounded
into
the
road
what
do
you
mean
boy
said
gradgrind
what
are
you
doing
how
dare
you
dash
this
manner
bitzer
picked
up
his
cap
which
the
concussion
had
knocked
off
and
backing
and
knuckling

frightened

and
offered
to
tell

and
she
ran
away
and
i
ran
after
her
sir
that
she
might
know
how
to

when
she
was
asked

wouldn
t
have
thought
of
saying

mischief

well
known
among

the
boy
stopped
in
his
rapid
blinking
knuckled
his
forehead
again
glanced
at
sissy
turned
about
and
retreated
now

said
gradgrind

bounderby

s
the
nine
the
what
cried
bounderby
the
nine

to
rub

then
said
bounderby
with
a
loud
short
laugh
what
the
devil
do
you
rub
your
father
with
nine
oils
for
it
s
what
our
people
aways
use
sir
when
they
get
any
hurts
in
the
ring
replied
the
girl
looking
over
her
shoulder
to
assure
herself
that
her
pursuer
was
gone
they
bruise
themselves
very
bad
serve
em
right
said
bounderby
for
being
she
glanced
up
at
his
face
with
mingled
astonishment
and
dread
by
george
said
bounderby
when
i
was
four
or
five
years
younger
than
you
i
had
worse
bruises
upon
me
than
ten
oils
twenty
oils
forty
oils
would
have
rubbed
off
i
didn
t
get
em
by
but
by
being
banged
about
there
was
no
for
me
i
danced
on
the
bare
ground
and
was
larruped
with
the
gradgrind
though
hard
enough
was
by
no
means
so
rough
a
man
as
bounderby
his
character
was
not
unkind
all
things
considered
it
might
have
been
a
very
kind
one
indeed
if
he
had
only
made
some
round
mistake
in
the
arithmetic
that
balanced
it
years
ago
he
said
in
what
he
meant
for
a
reassuring
tone
as
they
turned
down
a
narrow
road
and
this
is
pod
s

it
jupe
this
is
it
sir
you
wouldn
t
mind
is
the
she
stopped
at
twilight
at
the
door
of
a
mean
little
with
dim
red
lights
in
it
as
haggard
and
as
shabby
as
if
for
want
of
custom
it
had
itself
taken
to
drinking
and
had
gone
the
way
all
drunkards
go
and
was
very
near
the
end
of
it
it
s
only
crossing
the
bar
sir
and
up
the
stairs
if
you
wouldn
t
mind
and
waiting
there
for
a
moment
till
i

on

gradgrind
and
bounderby
received
no
offence
from
these
idealities
they
followed
the
girl
up
some
steep
without
meeting
any
one
and
stopped
in
the
dark
while
she
went
on
for
a
candle
they
expected
every
moment
to
hear
merrylegs
give
tongue
but
the
highly
trained
performing
dog
had
not
barked
when
the
girl
and
the

appeared
together

she
said
with
a
face
of
great
surprise
if
you
wouldn

mind

ll
find
him
they
walked
in
and
sissy
having
set
two
chairs
for
them
sped
away
with
a
quick
light
step
it
was
a
mean
shabbily
furnished
room
with
a
bed
in
it
the
white
embellished
with
two
peacock
s
feathers
and
a
pigtail
bolt
upright
in
which
signor

had
that
very
afternoon
enlivened
the
varied
performances
with
his
chaste
shaksperean
quips
and
retorts
hung
upon
a
nail
but
no
other
portion
of
his
wardrobe
or
other
token
of
himself
or
his
pursuits
was
to
be
seen
anywhere
as
to
merrylegs
that
respectable
ancestor
of
the
highly
trained
animal
who
went
aboard
the
ark
might
have
been
accidentally
shut
out
of
it
for
any
sign
of
a
dog
that
was
manifest
to
eye
or
ear
in
the
pegasus
s
arms
they
heard
the
doors
of
rooms
above
opening
and
shutting
as
sissy
went
from
one
to
another
in
quest
of
her
father
and
presently
they
heard
voices
expressing
surprise
she
came
bounding
down
again
in
a
great
hurry
opened
a
battered
and
mangy
old
hair
trunk
found
it
empty
and
looked
round
with
her
hands
clasped
and
her
face
full
of
terror
father
must
have
gone
down
to
the
booth
sir
i
don
t
know
why
he
should
go
there
but
he
must
be
there
i
ll
bring
him
in
a
minute
she
was
gone
directly
without
her
bonnet
with
her
long
dark
childish
hair
streaming
behind
her
what
does
she
mean
said
gradgrind
back
in
a
minute
it
s
more
than
a
mile
before
bounderby
could
reply
a
young
man
appeared
at
the
door
and
introducing
himself
with
the
words
by
your
leaves
gentlemen
walked
in
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
face
thin
and
sallow
was
shaded
by
a
great
quantity
of
dark
hair
brushed
into
a
roll
all
round
his
head
and
parted
up
the
centre
his
legs
were
very
robust
but
shorter
than
legs
of
good
proportions
should
have
been
his
chest
and
back
were
as
much
too
broad
as
his
legs
were
too
short
he
was
dressed
in
a
newmarket
coat
and
trousers
wore
a
shawl
round
his
neck
smelt
of
straw
horses
provender
and
sawdust
and
looked
a
most
remarkable
sort
of
centaur
compounded
of
the
stable
and
the
where
the
one
began
and
the
other
ended
nobody
could
have
told
with
any
precision
this
gentleman
was
mentioned
in
the
bills
of
the
day
as
childers
so
justly
celebrated
for
his
daring
vaulting
act
as
the
wild
huntsman
of
the
north
american
prairies
in
which
popular
performance
a
diminutive
boy
with
an
old
face
who
now
accompanied
him
assisted
as
his
infant
son
being
carried
upside
down
over
his
father
s
shoulder
by
one
foot
and
held
by
the
crown
of
his
head
heels
upwards
in
the
palm
of
his
father
s
hand
according
to
the
violent
paternal
manner
in
which
wild
huntsmen
may
be
observed
to
fondle
their
offspring
made
up
with
curls
wreaths
wings
white
bismuth
and
carmine
this
hopeful
young
person
soared
into
so
pleasing
a
cupid
as
to
constitute
the
chief
delight
of
the
maternal
part
of
the
spectators
but
in
private
where
his
characteristics
were
a
precocious
cutaway
coat
and
an
extremely
gruff
voice
he
became
of
the
turf
turfy
by
your
leaves
gentlemen
said
childers
glancing
round
the
room
it
was
you
i
believe
that
were
wishing
to
see
jupe
it
was
said
gradgrind
his
daughter
has
gone
to
fetch
him
but
i
can
t
wait
therefore
if
you
please
i
will
leave
a
message
for
him
with
you
see
my
friend
bounderby
put
in
we
are
the
kind
of
people
who
know
the
value
of
time
and
you
are
the
kind
of
people
who
don
t
know
the
value
of
i
have
not
retorted
childers
after
surveying
him
from
head
to
foot
the
honour
of
knowing
if
you
mean
that
you
can
make
more
money
of
your
time
than
i
can
of
mine
i
should
judge
from
your
appearance
that
you
are
about
and
when
you
have
made
it
you
can
keep
it
too
i
should
think
said
cupid
kidderminster
stow
that
said
childers
master
kidderminster
was
cupid
s
mortal
name
what
does
he
come
here
cheeking
us
for
then
cried
master
kidderminster
showing
a
very
irascible
temperament
if
you
want
to
cheek
us
pay
your
ochre
at
the
doors
and
take
it
kidderminster
said
childers
raising
his
voice
stow
that
to
gradgrind
i
was
addressing
myself
to
you
you
may
or
you
may
not
be
aware
for
perhaps
you
have
not
been
much
in
the
audience
that
jupe
has
missed
his
tip
very
often
has
he
missed
asked
gradgrind
glancing
at
the
potent
bounderby
for
assistance
missed
his
offered
at
the
garters
four
times
last
night
and
never
done
em
once
said
master
kidderminster
missed
his
tip
at
the
banners
too
and
was
loose
in
his
didn
t
do
what
he
ought
to
do
was
short
in
his
leaps
and
bad
in
his
tumbling
childers
interpreted
oh
said
gradgrind
that
is
tip
is
it
in
a
general
way
that
s
missing
his
tip
childers
answered
nine
oils
merrylegs
missing
tips
garters
banners
and
ponging
eh
ejaculated
bounderby
with
his
laugh
of
laughs
queer
sort
of
company
too
for
a
man
who
has
raised
himself
lower
yourself
then
retorted
cupid
oh
lord
if
you
ve
raised
yourself
so
high
as
all
that
comes
to
let
yourself
down
a
this
is
a
very
obtrusive
lad
said
gradgrind
turning
and
knitting
his
brows
on
him
we
d
have
had
a
young
gentleman
to
meet
you
if
we
had
known
you
were
coming
retorted
master
kidderminster
nothing
abashed
it
s
a
pity
you
don
t
have
a
bespeak
being
so
particular
you
re
on
the
ain
t
you
what
does
this
unmannerly
boy
mean
asked
gradgrind
eyeing
him
in
a
sort
of
desperation
by
there
get
out
get
out
said
childers
thrusting
his
young
friend
from
the
room
rather
in
the
prairie
manner
or
it
don
t
much
signify
it
s
only
and
you
were
going
to
give
me
a
message
for
jupe
yes
i
then
continued
childers
quickly
my
opinion
is
he
will
never
receive
it
do
you
know
much
of
him
i
never
saw
the
man
in
my
i
doubt
if
you
ever
see
him
now
it
s
pretty
plain
to
me
he
s
do
you
mean
that
he
has
deserted
his
daughter
ay
i
mean
said
childers
with
a
nod
that
he
has
cut
he
was
goosed
last
night
he
was
goosed
the
night
before
last
he
was
goosed
he
has
lately
got
in
the
way
of
being
always
goosed
and
he
can
t
stand
why
has
he
very
asked
gradgrind
forcing
the
word
out
of
himself
with
great
solemnity
and
reluctance
his
joints
are
turning
stiff
and
he
is
getting
used
up
said
childers
he
has
his
points
as
a
cackler
still
but
he
can
t
get
a
living
out
of
a
cackler
bounderby
repeated
here
we
go
again
a
speaker
if
the
gentleman
likes
it
better
said
childers
superciliously
throwing
the
interpretation
over
his
shoulder
and
accompanying
it
with
a
shake
of
his
long
all
shook
at
once
now
it
s
a
remarkable
fact
sir
that
it
cut
that
man
deeper
to
know
that
his
daughter
knew
of
his
being
goosed
than
to
go
through
with
good
interrupted
bounderby
this
is
good
gradgrind
a
man
so
fond
of
his
daughter
that
he
runs
away
from
her
this
is
devilish
good
ha
ha
now
i
ll
tell
you
what
young
man
i
haven
t
always
occupied
my
present
station
of
life
i
know
what
these
things
are
you
may
be
astonished
to
hear
it
but
my
away
from
childers
replied
pointedly
that
he
was
not
at
all
astonished
to
hear
it
very
well
said
bounderby
i
was
born
in
a
ditch
and
my
mother
ran
away
from
me
do
i
excuse
her
for
it
no
have
i
ever
excused
her
for
it
not
i
what
do
i
call
her
for
it
i
call
her
probably
the
very
worst
woman
that
ever
lived
in
the
world
except
my
drunken
grandmother
there
s
no
family
pride
about
me
there
s
no
imaginative
sentimental
humbug
about
me
i
call
a
spade
a
spade
and
i
call
the
mother
of
josiah
bounderby
of
coketown
without
any
fear
or
any
favour
what
i
should
call
her
if
she
had
been
the
mother
of
dick
jones
of
wapping
so
with
this
man
he
is
a
runaway
rogue
and
a
vagabond
that
s
what
he
is
in
it
s
all
the
same
to
me
what
he
is
or
what
he
is
not
whether
in
english
or
whether
in
french
retorted
childers
facing
about
i
am
telling
your
friend
what
s
the
fact
if
you
don
t
like
to
hear
it
you
can
avail
yourself
of
the
open
air
you
give
it
mouth
enough
you
do
but
give
it
mouth
in
your
own
building
at
least
remonstrated
with
stern
irony
don
t
give
it
mouth
in
this
building
till
you
re
called
upon
you
have
got
some
building
of
your
own
i
dare
say
now
perhaps
so
replied
bounderby
rattling
his
money
and
laughing
then
give
it
mouth
in
your
own
building
will
you
if
you
please
said
childers
because
this
isn
t
a
strong
building
and
too
much
of
you
might
bring
it
down
eyeing
bounderby
from
head
to
foot
again
he
turned
from
him
as
from
a
man
finally
disposed
of
to
gradgrind
jupe
sent
his
daughter
out
on
an
errand
not
an
hour
ago
and
then
was
seen
to
slip
out
himself
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
a
bundle
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
under
his
arm
she
will
never
believe
it
of
him
but
he
has
cut
away
and
left
pray
said
gradgrind
why
will
she
never
believe
it
of
him
because
those
two
were
one
because
they
were
never
asunder
because
up
to
this
time
he
seemed
to
dote
upon
her
said
childers
taking
a
step
or
two
to
look
into
the
empty
trunk
both
childers
and
master
kidderminster
walked
in
a
curious
manner
with
their
legs
wider
apart
than
the
general
run
of
men
and
with
a
very
knowing
assumption
of
being
stiff
in
the
knees
this
walk
was
common
to
all
the
male
members
of
sleary
s
company
and
was
understood
to
express
that
they
were
always
on
horseback
poor
sissy
he
had
better
have
apprenticed
her
said
childers
giving
his
hair
another
shake
as
he
looked
up
from
the
empty
box
now
he
leaves
her
without
anything
to
take
it
is
creditable
to
you
who
have
never
been
apprenticed
to
express
that
opinion
returned
gradgrind
approvingly
never
apprenticed
i
was
apprenticed
when
i
was
seven
year
oh
indeed
said
gradgrind
rather
resentfully
as
having
been
defrauded
of
his
good
opinion
i
was
not
aware
of
its
being
the
custom
to
apprentice
young
persons
idleness
bounderby
put
in
with
a
loud
laugh
no
by
the
lord
harry
nor
i
her
father
always
had
it
in
his
head
resumed
childers
feigning
unconsciousness
of
bounderby
s
existence
that
she
was
to
be
taught
the
of
education
how
it
got
into
his
head
i
can
t
say
i
can
only
say
that
it
never
got
out
he
has
been
picking
up
a
bit
of
reading
for
her
a
bit
of
writing
for
her
a
bit
of
ciphering
for
her
somewhere
seven
childers
took
one
of
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
stroked
his
face
and
chin
and
looked
with
a
good
deal
of
doubt
and
a
little
hope
at
gradgrind
from
the
first
he
had
sought
to
conciliate
that
gentleman
for
the
sake
of
the
deserted
girl
when
sissy
got
into
the
school
here
he
pursued
her
father
was
as
pleased
as
punch
i
couldn
t
altogether
make
out
why
myself
as
we
were
not
stationary
here
being
but
comers
and
goers
anywhere
i
suppose
however
he
had
this
move
in
his
was
always
then
considered
her
provided
for
if
you
should
happen
to
have
looked
in
for
the
purpose
of
telling
him
that
you
were
going
to
do
her
any
little
service
said
childers
stroking
his
face
again
and
repeating
his
look
it
would
be
very
fortunate
and
very
fortunate
and
on
the
contrary
returned
gradgrind
i
came
to
tell
him
that
her
connections
made
her
not
an
object
for
the
school
and
that
she
must
not
attend
any
more
still
if
her
father
really
has
left
her
without
any
connivance
on
her
let
me
have
a
word
with
upon
this
childers
politely
betook
himself
with
his
equestrian
walk
to
the
landing
outside
the
door
and
there
stood
stroking
his
face
and
softly
whistling
while
thus
engaged
he
overheard
such
phrases
in
bounderby
s
voice
as
no
say
no
i
advise
you
not
i
say
by
no
while
from
gradgrind
he
heard
in
his
much
lower
tone
the
words
but
even
as
an
example
to
louisa
of
what
this
pursuit
which
has
been
the
subject
of
a
vulgar
curiosity
leads
to
and
ends
in
think
of
it
bounderby
in
that
point
of
meanwhile
the
various
members
of
sleary
s
company
gradually
gathered
together
from
the
upper
regions
where
they
were
quartered
and
from
standing
about
talking
in
low
voices
to
one
another
and
to
childers
gradually
insinuated
themselves
and
him
into
the
room
there
were
two
or
three
handsome
young
women
among
them
with
their
two
or
three
husbands
and
their
two
or
three
mothers
and
their
eight
or
nine
little
children
who
did
the
fairy
business
when
required
the
father
of
one
of
the
families
was
in
the
habit
of
balancing
the
father
of
another
of
the
families
on
the
top
of
a
great
pole
the
father
of
a
third
family
often
made
a
pyramid
of
both
those
fathers
with
master
kidderminster
for
the
apex
and
himself
for
the
base
all
the
fathers
could
dance
upon
rolling
casks
stand
upon
bottles
catch
knives
and
balls
twirl
ride
upon
anything
jump
over
everything
and
stick
at
nothing
all
the
mothers
could
and
did
dance
upon
the
slack
wire
and
the
and
perform
rapid
acts
on
steeds
none
of
them
were
at
all
particular
in
respect
of
showing
their
legs
and
one
of
them
alone
in
a
greek
chariot
drove
six
in
hand
into
every
town
they
came
to
they
all
assumed
to
be
mighty
rakish
and
knowing
they
were
not
very
tidy
in
their
private
dresses
they
were
not
at
all
orderly
in
their
domestic
arrangements
and
the
combined
literature
of
the
whole
company
would
have
produced
but
a
poor
letter
on
any
subject
yet
there
was
a
remarkable
gentleness
and
childishness
about
these
people
a
special
inaptitude
for
any
kind
of
sharp
practice
and
an
untiring
readiness
to
help
and
pity
one
another
deserving
often
of
as
much
respect
and
always
of
as
much
generous
construction
as
the
virtues
of
any
class
of
people
in
the
world
last
of
all
appeared
sleary
a
stout
man
as
already
mentioned
with
one
fixed
eye
and
one
loose
eye
a
voice
if
it
can
be
called
so
like
the
efforts
of
a
broken
old
pair
of
bellows
a
flabby
surface
and
a
muddled
head
which
was
never
sober
and
never
drunk

have
a
glath
of
here
his
daughter
pretty
girl
of
eighteen
who
had
been
tied
on
a
horse
at
two
years
old
and
had
made
a
will
at
twelve
which
she
always
carried
about
with
her
expressive
of
her
dying
desire
to
be
drawn
to
the
grave
by
the
two
piebald
father
hush
she
has
come
back
then
came
sissy
jupe
running
into
the
room
as
she
had
run
out
of
it
and
when
she
saw
them
all
assembled
and
saw
their
looks
and
saw
no
father
there
she
broke
into
a
most
deplorable
cry
and
took
refuge
on
the
bosom
of
the
most
accomplished
lady
herself
in
the
who
knelt
down
on
the
floor
to
nurse
her
and
to
weep
over
her
ith
an
internal
thame
upon
my
thoul
it
ith
said
sleary
o
my
dear
father
my
good
kind
father
where
are
you
gone
you
are
gone
to
try
to
do
me
some
good
i
know
you
are
gone
away
for
my
sake
i
am
sure
and
how
miserable
and
helpless
you
will
be
without
me
poor
poor
father
until
you
come
back
it
was
so
pathetic
to
hear
her
saying
many
things
of
this
kind
with
her
face
turned
upward
and
her
arms
stretched
out
as
if
she
were
trying
to
stop
his
departing
shadow
and
embrace
it
that
no
one
spoke
a
word
until
bounderby
growing
impatient
took
the
case
in
hand
now
good
people
all
said
he
this
is
wanton
waste
of
time
let
the
girl
understand
the
fact
let
her
take
it
from
me
if
you
like
who
have
been
run
away
from
myself
here
what
s
your
name
your
father
has
you
mustn
t
expect
to
see
him
again
as
long
as
you
they
cared
so
little
for
plain
fact
these
people
and
were
in
that
advanced
state
of
degeneracy
on
the
subject
that
instead
of
being
impressed
by
the
speaker
s
strong
common
sense
they
took
it
in
extraordinary
dudgeon
the
men
muttered
shame
and
the
women
brute
and
sleary
in
some
haste
communicated
the
following
hint
apart
to
bounderby
i
tell
you
what
thquire
to
thpeak
plain
to
you
my
opinion
ith
that
you
had
better
cut
it
thort
and
drop
it
they
re
a
very
good
natur
d
people
my
people
but
they
re
accuthtomed
to
be
quick
in
their
movementh
and
if
you
don
t
act
upon
my
advithe
i
m
damned
if
i
don
t
believe
they
ll
pith
you
out
o
bounderby
being
restrained
by
this
mild
suggestion
gradgrind
found
an
opening
for
his
eminently
practical
exposition
of
the
subject
it
is
of
no
moment
said
he
whether
this
person
is
to
be
expected
back
at
any
time
or
the
contrary
he
is
gone
away
and
there
is
no
present
expectation
of
his
return
that
i
believe
is
agreed
on
all
thath
agreed
thquire
thick
to
that
from
sleary
well
then
i
who
came
here
to
inform
the
father
of
the
poor
girl
jupe
that
she
could
not
be
received
at
the
school
any
more
in
consequence
of
there
being
practical
objections
into
which
i
need
not
enter
to
the
reception
there
of
the
children
of
persons
so
employed
am
prepared
in
these
altered
circumstances
to
make
a
proposal
i
am
willing
to
take
charge
of
you
jupe
and
to
educate
you
and
provide
for
you
the
only
condition
over
and
above
your
good
behaviour
i
make
is
that
you
decide
now
at
once
whether
to
accompany
me
or
remain
here
also
that
if
you
accompany
me
now
it
is
understood
that
you
communicate
no
more
with
any
of
your
friends
who
are
here
present
these
observations
comprise
the
whole
of
the
at
the
thame
time
said
sleary
i
mutht
put
in
my
word
thquire
tho
that
both
thides
of
the
banner
may
be
equally
theen
if
you
like
thethilia
to
be

the

of
the
work
and
you
know
your
companionth
emma
gordon
in
whothe
lap
you
re
a
lying
at
prethent
would
be
a
mother
to
you
and
joth

would

a
thithter
to

i
don

to
be

and
i

what
when
you

you

at

never

cackler
thquire
and
i
have
thed
my
the
latter
part
of
this
speech
was
addressed
to
gradgrind
who
received
it
with
a
grave
inclination
of
his
head
and
then
remarked
the
only
observation
i
will
make
to
you
jupe
in
the
way
of
influencing
your
decision
is
that
it
is
highly
desirable
to
have
a
sound
practical
education
and
that
even
your
father
himself
from
what
i
understand
appears
on
your
behalf
to
have
known
and
felt
that
the
last
words
had
a
visible
effect
upon
her
she
stopped
in
her
wild
crying
a
little
detached
herself
from
emma
gordon
and
turned
her
face
full
upon
her
patron
the
whole
company
perceived
the
force
of
the
change
and
drew
a
long
breath
together
that
plainly
said
she
will
go
be
sure
you
know
your
own
mind
jupe
gradgrind
cautioned
her
i
say
no
more
be
sure
you
know
your
own
mind
when
father
comes
back
cried
the
girl
bursting
into
tears
again
after
a
minute
s
silence
how
will
he
ever
find
me
if
i
go
away
you
may
be
quite
at
ease
said
gradgrind
calmly
he
worked
out
the
whole
matter
like
a
sum
you
may
be
quite
at
ease
jupe
on
that
score
in
such
a
case
your
father
i
apprehend
must
find
out
thleary
thath
my
name
thquire
not
athamed
of
it
known
all
over
england
and
alwayth
paythe
ith
must
find
out
sleary
who
would
then
let
him
know
where
you
went
i
should
have
no
power
of
keeping
you
against
his
wish
and
he
would
have
no
difficulty
at
any
time
in
finding
thomas
gradgrind
of
coketown
i
am
well
well
known
assented
sleary
rolling
his
loose
eye
you
re
one
of
the
thort
thquire
that
keepth
a
prethiouth
thight
of
money
out
of
the
houthe
but
never
mind
that
at
there
was
another
silence
and
then
she
exclaimed
sobbing
with
her
hands
before
her
face
oh
give
me
my
clothes
give
me
my
clothes
and
let
me
go
away
before
i
break
my
heart
the
women
sadly
bestirred
themselves
to
get
the
clothes
was
soon
done
for
they
were
not
to
pack
them
in
a
basket
which
had
often
travelled
with
them
sissy
sat
all
the
time
upon
the
ground
still
sobbing
and
covering
her
eyes
gradgrind
and
his
friend
bounderby
stood
near
the
door
ready
to
take
her
away
sleary
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
the
male
members
of
the
company
about
him
exactly
as
he
would
have
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
ring
during
his
daughter
josephine
s
performance
he
wanted
nothing
but
his
whip
the
basket
packed
in
silence
they
brought
her
bonnet
to
her
and
smoothed
her
disordered
hair
and
put
it
on
then
they
pressed
about
her
and
bent
over
her
in
very
natural
attitudes
kissing
and
embracing
her
and
brought
the
children
to
take
leave
of
her
and
were
a
simple
foolish
set
of
women
altogether
now
jupe
said
gradgrind
if
you
are
quite
determined
come
but
she
had
to
take
her
farewell
of
the
male
part
of
the
company
yet
and
every
one
of
them
had
to
unfold
his
arms
for
they
all
assumed
the
professional
attitude
when
they
found
themselves
near
sleary
and
give
her
a
parting
kidderminster
excepted
in
whose
young
nature
there
was
an
original
flavour
of
the
misanthrope
who
was
also
known
to
have
harboured
matrimonial
views
and
who
moodily
withdrew
sleary
was
reserved
until
the
last
opening
his
arms
wide
he
took
her
by
both
her
hands
and
would
have
sprung
her
up
and
down
after
the
manner
of
congratulating
young
ladies
on
their
dismounting
from
a
rapid
act
but
there
was
no
rebound
in
sissy
and
she
only
stood
before
him
crying
my
dear
said
sleary
you
ll
make
your
fortun

and
none
of
our
poor

with
that
he
regarded
her
attentively
with
his
fixed
eye

his
company
with
his
loose
one
kissed
her
shook
his
head
and
handed
her
to
gradgrind
as
to
a
horse
there
the
ith
thquire
he
said
sweeping
her
with
a
professional
glance
as
if
she
were
being

in
her
seat
and

in
a
variety
of
voices
from
all
the
room
but
the
eye
had
observed
the
bottle
of
the
nine
oils
in
her
bosom
and
he
now
interposed
with
leave

bottle

sparsit
bounderby
being
a
bachelor
an
elderly
lady
presided
over
his
establishment
in
consideration
of
a
certain
annual
stipend
sparsit
was
this
lady
s
name
and
she
was
a
prominent
figure
in
attendance
on
bounderby
s
car
as
it
rolled
along
in
triumph
with
the
bully
of
humility
inside
for
sparsit
had
not
only
seen
different
days
but
was
highly
connected
she
had
a
great
aunt
living
in
these
very
times
called
lady
scadgers
sparsit
deceased
of
whom
she
was
the
relict
had
been
by
the
mother
s
side
what
sparsit
still
called
a
strangers
of
limited
information
and
dull
apprehension
were
sometimes
observed
not
to
know
what
a
powler
was
and
even
to
appear
uncertain
whether
it
might
be
a
business
or
a
political
party
or
a
profession
of
faith
the
better
class
of
minds
however
did
not
need
to
be
informed
that
the
powlers
were
an
ancient
stock
who
could
trace
themselves
so
exceedingly
far
back
that
it
was
not
surprising
if
they
sometimes
lost
they
had
rather
frequently
done
as
respected
hebrew
monetary
transactions
and
the
insolvent

the
late
sparsit
being
by
the
mother
s
side
a
powler
married
this
lady
being
by
the
father
s
side
a
scadgers
lady
scadgers
an
immensely
fat
old
woman
with
an
inordinate
appetite
for
butcher
s
meat
and
a
mysterious
leg
which
had
now
refused
to
get
out
of
bed
for
fourteen
years
contrived
the
marriage
at
a
period
when
sparsit
was
just
of
age
and
chiefly
noticeable
for
a
slender
body
weakly
supported
on
two
long
slim
props
and
surmounted
by
no
head
worth
mentioning
he
inherited
a
fair
fortune
from
his
uncle
but
owed
it
all
before
he
came
into
it
and
spent
it
twice
over
immediately
afterwards
thus
when
he
died
at
the
scene
of
his
decease
calais
and
the
cause
brandy
he
did
not
leave
his
widow
from
whom
he
had
been
separated
soon
after
the
honeymoon
in
affluent
circumstances
that
bereaved
lady
fifteen
years
older
than
he
fell
presently
at
deadly
feud
with
her
only
relative
lady
scadgers
and
partly
to
spite
her
ladyship
and
partly
to
maintain
herself
went
out
at
a
salary
and
here
she
was
now
in
her
elderly
days
with
the
coriolanian
style
of
nose
and
the
dense
black
eyebrows
which
had
captivated
sparsit
making
bounderby
s
tea
as
he
took
his
breakfast
if
bounderby
had
been
a
conqueror
and
sparsit
a
captive
princess
whom
he
took
about
as
a
feature
in
his
he
could
not
have
made
a
greater
flourish
with
her
than
he
habitually
did
just
as
it
belonged
to
his
boastfulness
to
depreciate
his
own
extraction
so
it
belonged
to
it
to
exalt
sparsit
s
in
the
measure
that
he
would
not
allow
his
own
youth
to
have
been
attended
by
a
single
favourable
circumstance
he
brightened
sparsit
s
juvenile
career
with
every
possible
advantage
and
showered
of
early
roses
all
over
that
lady
s
path
and
yet
sir
he
would
say
how
does
it
turn
out
after
all
why
here
she
is
at
a
hundred
a
year
i
give
her
a
hundred
which
she
is
pleased
to
term
handsome
keeping
the
house
of
josiah
bounderby
of
coketown
nay
he
made
this
foil
of
his
so
very
widely
known
that
third
parties
took
it
up
and
handled
it
on
some
occasions
with
considerable
briskness
it
was
one
of
the
most
exasperating
attributes
of
bounderby
that
he
not
only
sang
his
own
praises
but
stimulated
other
men
to
sing
them
there
was
a
moral
infection
of
in
him
strangers
modest
enough
elsewhere
started
up
at
dinners
in
coketown
and
boasted
in
quite
a
rampant
way
of
bounderby
they
made
him
out

was
for
certain
more
or
less
understood
among
the
company
that
he
had
heard
of
sparsit
mr
bounderby
said
sparsit
you
are
unusually
slow
sir
with
your
breakfast
this
why
ma
am
he
returned
i
am
thinking
about
tom
gradgrind
s
whim
tom
gradgrind
for
a
bluff
independent
manner
of
if
somebody
were
always
endeavouring
to
bribe
him
with
immense
sums
to
say
thomas
and
he
wouldn
t
tom
gradgrind
s
whim
ma
am
of
bringing
up
the
the
girl
is
now
waiting
to
know
said
sparsit
whether
she
is
to
go
straight
to
the
school
or
up
to
the
she
must
wait
ma
am
answered
bounderby
till
i
know
myself
we
shall
have
tom
gradgrind
down
here
presently
i
suppose
if
he
should
wish
her
to
remain
here
a
day
or
two
longer
of
course
she
can
ma
of
course
she
can
if
you
wish
it
i
told
him
i
would
give
her
a
here
last
night
in
order
that
he
might
sleep
on
it
before
he
decided
to
let
her
have
any
association
with
indeed
bounderby
very
thoughtful
of
you
sparsit
s
coriolanian
nose
underwent
a
slight
expansion
of
the
nostrils
and
her
black
eyebrows
contracted
as
she
took
a
sip
of
tea
it
s
tolerably
clear
to
said
bounderby
that
the
little
puss
can
get
small
good
out
of
such
are
you
speaking
of
young
miss
gradgrind
bounderby
yes
ma
am
i
m
speaking
of
your
observation
being
limited
to
little
puss
said
sparsit
and
there
being
two
little
girls
in
question
i
did
not
know
which
might
be
indicated
by
that
louisa
repeated
bounderby
louisa
you
are
quite
another
father
to
louisa
sparsit
took
a
little
more
tea
and
as
she
bent
her
again
contracted
eyebrows
over
her
steaming
cup
rather
looked
as
if
her
classical
countenance
were
invoking
the
infernal
gods
if
you
had
said
i
was
another
father
to
tom
i
mean
not
my
friend
tom
might
have
been
nearer
the
mark
i
am
going
to
take
young
tom
into
my
office
going
to
have
him
under
my
wing
ma
indeed
rather
young
for
that
is
he
not
sir
spirit
s
sir
in
addressing
bounderby
was
a
word
of
ceremony
rather
exacting
consideration
for
herself
in
the
use
than
honouring
him
i
m
not
going
to
take
him
at
once
he
is
to
finish
his
educational
cramming
before
then
said
bounderby
by
the
lord
harry
he
ll
have
enough
of
it
first
and
last
he
d
open
his
eyes
that
boy
would
if
he
knew
how
empty
of
learning
young
maw
was
at
his
time
of
which
by
the
by
he
probably
did
know
for
he
had
heard
of
it
often
enough
but
it
s
extraordinary
the
difficulty
i
have
on
scores
of
such
subjects
in
speaking
to
any
one
on
equal
terms
here
for
example
i
have
been
speaking
to
you
this
morning
about
tumblers
why
what
do
know
about
tumblers
at
the
time
when
to
have
been
a
tumbler
in
the
mud
of
the
streets
would
have
been
a
godsend
to
me
a
prize
in
the
lottery
to
me
you
were
at
the
italian
opera
you
were
coming
out
of
the
italian
opera
ma
am
in
white
satin
and
jewels
a
blaze
of
splendour
when
i
hadn
t
a
penny
to
buy
a
link
to
light
i
certainly
sir
returned
sparsit
with
a
dignity
serenely
mournful
was
familiar
with
the
italian
opera
at
a
very
early
egad
ma
am
so
was
i
said
bounderby
the
wrong
side
of
it
a
hard
bed
the
pavement
of
its
arcade
used
to
make
i
assure
you
people
like
you
ma
am
accustomed
from
infancy
to
lie
on
down
feathers
have
no
idea
hard
a
is
without
trying
it
no
no
it
s
of
no
use
my
talking
to
about
tumblers
i
should
speak
of
foreign
dancers
and
the
west
end
of
london
and
may
fair
and
lords
and
ladies
and
i
trust
sir
rejoined
sparsit
with
decent
resignation
it
is
not
necessary
that
you
should
do
anything
of
that
kind
i
hope
i
have
learnt
how
to
accommodate
myself
to
the
changes
of
life
if
i
have
acquired
an
interest
in
hearing
of
your
instructive
experiences
and
can
scarcely
hear
enough
of
them
i
claim
no
merit
for
that
since
i
believe
it
is
a
general
well
ma
am
said
her
patron
perhaps
some
people
may
be
pleased
to
say
that
they
do
like
to
hear
in
his
own
unpolished
way
what
josiah
bounderby
of
coketown
has
gone
through
but
you
must
confess
that
you
were
born
in
the
lap
of
luxury
yourself
come
ma
am
you
know
you
were
born
in
the
lap
of
i
do
not
sir
returned
sparsit
with
a
shake
of
her
head
deny
bounderby
was
obliged
to
get
up
from
table
and
stand
with
his
back
to
the
fire
looking
at
her
she
was
such
an
enhancement
of
his
position
and
you
were
in
crack
society
devilish
high
society
he
said
warming
his
legs
it
is
true
sir
returned
sparsit
with
an
affectation
of
humility
the
very
opposite
of
his
and
therefore
in
no
danger
of
jostling
it
you
were
in
the
tiptop
fashion
and
all
the
rest
of
it
said
bounderby
yes
sir
returned
sparsit
with
a
kind
of
social
widowhood
upon
her
it
is
unquestionably
bounderby
bending
himself
at
the
knees
literally
embraced
his
legs
in
his
great
satisfaction
and
laughed
aloud
and
miss
gradgrind
being
then
announced
he
received
the
former
with
a
shake
of
the
hand
and
the
latter
with
a
kiss
can
jupe
be
sent
here
bounderby
asked
gradgrind
certainly
so
jupe
was
sent
there
on
coming
in
she
curtseyed
to
bounderby
and
to
his
friend
tom
gradgrind
and
also
to
louisa
but
in
her
confusion
unluckily
omitted
sparsit
observing
this
the
blustrous
bounderby
had
the
following
remarks
to
make
now
i
tell
you
what
my
girl
the
name
of
that
lady
by
the
teapot
is
sparsit
that
lady
acts
as
mistress
of
this
house
and
she
is
a
highly
connected
lady
consequently
if
ever
you
come
again
into
any
room
in
this
house
you
will
make
a
short
stay
in
it
if
you
don
t
behave
towards
that
lady
in
your
most
respectful
manner
now
i
don
t
care
a
button
what
you
do
to
because
i
don
t
affect
to
be
anybody
so
far
from
having
high
connections
i
have
no
connections
at
all
and
i
come
of
the
scum
of
the
earth
but
towards
that
lady
i
do
care
what
you
do
and
you
shall
do
what
is
deferential
and
respectful
or
you
shall
not
come
i
hope
bounderby
said
gradgrind
in
a
conciliatory
voice
that
this
was
merely
an
my
friend
tom
gradgrind
suggests
sparsit
said
bounderby
that
this
was
merely
an
oversight
very
likely
however
as
you
are
aware
ma
am
i
don
t
allow
of
even
oversights
towards
you
are
very
good
indeed
sir
returned
sparsit
shaking
her
head
with
her
state
humility
it
is
not
worth
speaking
sissy
who
all
this
time
had
been
faintly
excusing
herself
with
tears
in
her
eyes
was
now
waved
over
by
the
master
of
the
house
to
gradgrind
she
stood
looking
intently
at
him
and
louisa
stood
coldly
by
with
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
while
he
proceeded
thus
jupe
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
take
you
into
my
house
and
when
you
are
not
in
attendance
at
the
school
to
employ
you
about
gradgrind
who
is
rather
an
invalid
i
have
explained
to
miss
is
miss
miserable
but
natural
end
of
your
late
career
and
you
are
to
expressly
understand
that
the
whole
of
that
subject
is
past
and
is
not
to
be
referred
to
any
more
from
this
time
you
begin
your
history
you
are
at
present
ignorant
i
yes
sir
very
she
answered
curtseying
i
shall
have
the
satisfaction
of
causing
you
to
be
strictly
educated
and
you
will
be
a
living
proof
to
all
who
come
into
communication
with
you
of
the
advantages
of
the
training
you
will
receive
you
will
be
reclaimed
and
formed
you
have
been
in
the
habit
now
of
reading
to
your
father
and
those
people
i
found
you
among
i
dare
say
said
gradgrind
beckoning
her
nearer
to
him
before
he
said
so
and
dropping
his
voice
only
to
father
and
merrylegs
sir
at
least
i
mean
to
father
when
merrylegs
was
always
never
mind
merrylegs
jupe
said
gradgrind
with
a
passing
frown
i
don
t
ask
about
him
i
understand
you
to
have
been
in
the
habit
of
reading
to
your
father
o
yes
sir
thousands
of
times
they
were
the
of
all
the
happy
times
we
had
together
sir
it
was
only
now
when
her
sorrow
broke
out
that
louisa
looked
at
her
and
what
asked
gradgrind
in
a
still
lower
voice
did
you
read
to
your
father
jupe
about
the
fairies
sir
and
the
dwarf
and
the
hunchback
and
the
genies
she
sobbed
out
and
hush
said
gradgrind
that
is
enough
never
breathe
a
word
of
such
destructive
nonsense
any
more
bounderby
this
is
a
case
for
rigid
training
and
i
shall
observe
it
with
well
returned
bounderby
i
have
given
you
my
opinion
already
and
i
shouldn
t
do
as
you
do
but
very
well
very
well
since
you
are
bent
upon
it
well
so
gradgrind
and
his
daughter
took
cecilia
jupe
off
with
them
to
stone
lodge
and
on
the
way
louisa
never
spoke
one
word
good
or
bad
and
bounderby
went
about
his
daily
pursuits
and
sparsit
got
behind
her
eyebrows
and
meditated
in
the
gloom
of
that
retreat
all
the
evening
chapter
viii
never
wonder
let
us
strike
the
again
before
pursuing
the
tune
when
she
was
half
a
dozen
years
younger
louisa
had
been
overheard
to
begin
a
conversation
with
her
brother
one
day
by
saying
tom
i
wonder
which
gradgrind
who
was
the
person
overhearing
stepped
forth
into
the
light
and
said
louisa
never
wonder
herein
lay
the
spring
of
the
mechanical
art
and
mystery
of
educating
the
reason
without
stooping
to
the
cultivation
of
the
sentiments
and
affections
never
wonder
by
means
of
addition
subtraction
multiplication
and
division
settle
everything
somehow
and
never
wonder
bring
to
me
says
m
choakumchild
yonder
baby
just
able
to
walk
and
i
will
engage
that
it
shall
never
wonder
now
besides
very
many
babies
just
able
to
walk
there
happened
to
be
in
coketown
a
considerable
population
of
babies
who
had
been
walking
against
time
towards
the
infinite
world
twenty
thirty
forty
fifty
years
and
more
these
portentous
infants
being
alarming
creatures
to
stalk
about
in
any
human
society
the
eighteen
denominations
incessantly
scratched
one
another
s
faces
and
pulled
one
another
s
hair
by
way
of
agreeing
on
the
steps
to
be
taken
for
their
they
never
did
a
surprising
circumstance
when
the
happy
adaptation
of
the
means
to
the
end
is
considered
still
although
they
differed
in
every
other
particular
conceivable
and
inconceivable
especially
inconceivable
they
were
pretty
well
united
on
the
point
that
these
unlucky
infants
were
never
to
wonder
body
number
one
said
they
must
take
everything
on
trust
body
number
two
said
they
must
take
everything
on

economy
body
number
three
wrote
leaden
little
books
for
them
showing
how
the
good
baby
invariably
got
to
the
and
the
bad
baby
invariably
got
transported
body
number
four
under
dreary
pretences
of
being
droll
when
it
was
very
melancholy
indeed
made
the
shallowest
pretences
of
concealing
pitfalls
of
knowledge
into
which
it
was
the
duty
of
these
babies
to
be
smuggled
and
inveigled
but
all
the
bodies
agreed
that
they
were
never
to
wonder
there
was
a
library
in
coketown
to
which
general
access
was
easy
gradgrind
greatly
tormented
his
mind
about
what
the
people
read
in
this
library
a
point
whereon
little
rivers
of
tabular
statements
periodically
flowed
into
the
howling
ocean
of
tabular
statements
which
no
diver
ever
got
to
any
depth
in
and
came
up
sane
it
was
a
disheartening
circumstance
but
a
melancholy
fact
that
even
these
readers
persisted
in
wondering
they
wondered
about
human
nature
human
passions
human
hopes
and
fears
the
struggles
triumphs
and
defeats
the
cares
and
joys
and
sorrows
the
lives
and
deaths
of
common
men
and
women
they
sometimes
after
fifteen
hours
work
sat
down
to
read
mere
fables
about
men
and
women
more
or
less
like
themselves
and
about
children
more
or
less
like
their
own
they
took
de
foe
to
their
bosoms
instead
of
euclid
and
seemed
to
be
on
the
whole
more
comforted
by
goldsmith
than
by
cocker
gradgrind
was
for
ever
working
in
print
and
out
of
print
at
this
eccentric
sum
and
he
never
could
make
out
how
it
yielded
this
unaccountable
product
i
am
sick
of
my
life
loo
i
hate
it
altogether
and
i
hate
everybody
except
you
said
the
unnatural
young
thomas
gradgrind
in
the
chamber
at
twilight
you
don
t
hate
sissy
tom
i
hate
to
be
obliged
to
call
her
jupe
and
she
hates
me
said
tom
moodily
no
she
does
not
tom
i
am
sure
she
must
said
tom
she
must
just
hate
and
detest
the
whole
of
us
they
ll
bother
her
head
off
i
think
before
they
have
done
with
her
already
she
s
getting
as
pale
as
wax
and
as
heavy
young
thomas
expressed
these
sentiments
sitting
astride
of
a
chair
before
the
fire
with
his
arms
on
the
back
and
his
sulky
face
on
his
arms
his
sister
sat
in
the
darker
corner
by
the
fireside
now
looking
at
him
now
looking
at
the
bright
sparks
as
they
dropped
upon
the
hearth
as
to
me
said
tom
tumbling
his
hair
all
manner
of
ways
with
his
sulky
hands
i
am
a
donkey
that
s
what
am
i
am
as
obstinate
as
one
i
am
more
stupid
than
one
i
get
as
much
pleasure
as
one
and
i
should
like
to
kick
like
not
me
i
hope
tom
no
loo
i
wouldn
t
hurt
i
made
an
exception
of
you
at
first
i
don
t
know
what
jail
tom
had
paused
to
find
a
sufficiently
complimentary
and
expressive
name
for
the
parental
roof
and
seemed
to
relieve
his
mind
for
a
moment
by
the
strong
alliteration
of
this
one
would
be
without
indeed
tom
do
you
really
and
truly
say
so
why
of
course
i
do
what
s
the
use
of
talking
about
it
returned
tom
chafing
his
face
on
his
as
if
to
mortify
his
flesh
and
have
it
in
unison
with
his
spirit
because
tom
said
his
sister
after
silently
watching
the
sparks
awhile
as
i
get
older
and
nearer
growing
up
i
often
sit
wondering
here
and
think
how
unfortunate
it
is
for
me
that
i
can
t
reconcile
you
to
home
better
than
i
am
able
to
do
i
don
t
know
what
other
girls
know
i
can
t
play
to
you
or
sing
to
you
i
can
t
talk
to
you
so
as
to
lighten
your
mind
for
i
never
see
any
amusing
sights
or
read
any
amusing
books
that
it
would
be
a
pleasure
or
a
relief
to
you
to
talk
about
when
you
are
well
no
more
do
i
am
as
bad
as
you
in
that
respect
and
i
am
a
mule
too
which
you
re
not
if
father
was
determined
to
make
me
either
a
prig
or
a
mule
and
i
am
not
a
prig
why
it
stands
to
reason
i
must
be
a
mule
and
so
i
am
said
tom
desperately
it
s
a
great
pity
said
louisa
after
another
pause
and
speaking
thoughtfully
out
of
her
dark
corner
it
s
a
great
pity
tom
it
s
very
unfortunate
for
both
of
oh
you
said
tom
you
are
a
girl
loo
and
a
girl
comes
out
of
it
better
than
a
boy
does
i
don
t
miss
anything
in
you
you
are
the
only
pleasure
i
can
brighten
even
this
you
can
always
lead
me
as
you
you
are
a
dear
brother
tom
and
while
you
think
i
can
do
such
things
i
don
t
so
much
mind
knowing
better
though
i
do
know
better
tom
and
am
very
sorry
for
she
came
and
kissed
him
and
went
back
into
her
corner
again
i
wish
i
could
collect
all
the
facts
we
hear
so
much
about
said
tom
spitefully
setting
his
teeth
and
all
the
figures
and
all
the
people
who
found
them
out
and
i
wish
i
could
put
a
thousand
barrels
of
gunpowder
under
them
and
blow
them
all
up
together
however
when
i
go
to
live
with
old
bounderby
i
ll
have
my
your
revenge
tom
i
mean
i
ll
enjoy
myself
a
little
and
go
about
and
see
something
and
hear
something
i
ll
recompense
myself
for
the
way
in
which
i
have
been
brought
but
don
t
disappoint
yourself
beforehand
tom
bounderby
thinks
as
father
thinks
and
is
a
great
deal
rougher
and
not
half
so
oh
said
tom
laughing
i
don
t
mind
that
i
shall
very
well
know
how
to
manage
and
smooth
old
bounderby
their
shadows
were
defined
upon
the
wall
but
those
of
the
high
presses
in
the
room
were
all
blended
together
on
the
wall
and
on
the
ceiling
as
if
the
brother
and
sister
were
overhung
by
a
dark
cavern
or
a
fanciful
such
treason
could
have
been
have
made
it
out
to
be
the
shadow
of
their
subject
and
of
its
lowering
association
with
their
future
what
is
your
great
mode
of
smoothing
and
managing
tom
is
it
a
secret
oh
said
tom
if
it
is
a
secret
it
s
not
far
off
it
s
you
you
are
his
little
pet
you
are
his
favourite
he
ll
do
anything
for
you
when
he
says
to
me
what
i
don
t
like
i
shall
say
to
him
my
sister
loo
will
be
hurt
and
disappointed
bounderby
she
always
used
to
tell
me
she
was
sure
you
would
be
easier
with
me
than
that
ll
bring
him
about
or
nothing
after
waiting
for
some
answering
remark
and
getting
none
tom
wearily
relapsed
into
the
present
time
and
twined
himself
yawning
round
and
about
the
rails
of
his
chair
and
rumpled
his
head
more
and
more
until
he
suddenly
looked
up
and
asked
have
you
gone
to
sleep
loo
no
tom
i
am
looking
at
the
you
seem
to
find
more
to
look
at
in
it
than
ever
i
could
find
said
tom
another
of
the
advantages
i
suppose
of
being
a
tom
enquired
his
sister
slowly
and
in
a
curious
tone
as
if
she
were
reading
what
she
asked
in
the
fire
and
it
was
not
quite
plainly
written
there
do
you
look
forward
with
any
satisfaction
to
this
change
to
bounderby
s
why
there
s
one
thing
to
be
said
of
it
returned
tom
pushing
his
chair
from
him
and
standing
up
it
will
be
getting
away
from
there
is
one
thing
to
be
said
of
it
louisa
repeated
in
her
former
curious
tone
it
will
be
getting
away
from
home
not
but
what
i
shall
be
very
unwilling
both
to
leave
you
loo
and
to
leave
you
here
but
i
must
go
you
know
whether
i
like
it
or
not
and
i
had
better
go
where
i
can
take
with
me
some
advantage
of
your
influence
than
where
i
should
lose
it
altogether
don
t
you
see
yes
the
answer
was
so
long
in
coming
though
there
was
no
indecision
in
it
that
tom
went
and
leaned
on
the
back
of
her
chair
to
contemplate
the
fire
which
so
engrossed
her
from
her
point
of
view
and
see
what
he
could
make
of
it
except
that
it
is
a
fire
said
tom
it
looks
to
me
as
stupid
and
blank
as
everything
else
looks
what
do
you
see
in
it
not
a
circus
i
don
t
see
anything
in
it
tom
particularly
but
since
i
have
been
looking
at
it
i
have
been
wondering
about
you
and
me
grown
wondering
again
said
tom
i
have
such
unmanageable
thoughts
returned
his
sister
that
they
then
i
beg
of
you
louisa
said
gradgrind
who
had
opened
the
door
without
being
heard
to
do
nothing
of
that
description
for
goodness
sake
you
inconsiderate
girl
or
i
shall
never
hear
the
last
of
it
from
your
father
and
thomas
it
is
really
shameful
with
my
poor
head
continually
wearing
me
out
that
a
boy
brought
up
as
you
have
been
and
whose
education
has
cost
what
yours
has
should
be
found
encouraging
his
sister
to
wonder
when
he
knows
his
father
has
expressly
said
that
she
is
not
to
do
louisa
denied
tom
s
participation
in
the
offence
but
her
mother
stopped
her
with
the
conclusive
answer
louisa
don
t
tell
me
in
my
state
of
health
for
unless
you
had
been
encouraged
it
is
morally
and
physically
impossible
that
you
could
have
done
i
was
encouraged
by
nothing
mother
but
by
looking
at
the
red
sparks
dropping
out
of
the
fire
and
whitening
and
dying
it
made
me
think
after
all
how
short
my
life
would
be
and
how
little
i
could
hope
to
do
in
nonsense
said
gradgrind
rendered
almost
energetic
nonsense
don
t
stand
there
and
tell
me
such
stuff
louisa
to
my
face
when
you
know
very
well
that
if
it
was
ever
to
reach
your
father
s
ears
i
should
never
hear
the
last
of
it
after
all
the
trouble
that
has
been
taken
with
you
after
the
lectures
you
have
attended
and
the
experiments
you
have
seen
after
i
have
heard
you
myself
when
the
whole
of
my
right
side
has
been
benumbed
going
on
with
your
master
about
combustion
and
calcination
and
calorification
and
i
may
say
every
kind
of
ation
that
could
drive
a
poor
invalid
distracted
to
hear
you
talking
in
this
absurd
way
about
sparks
and
ashes
i
wish
whimpered
gradgrind
taking
a
chair
and
discharging
her
strongest
point
before
succumbing
under
these
mere
shadows
of
facts
yes
i
really
wish
that
i
had
never
had
a
family
and
then
you
would
have
known
what
it
was
to
do
without
me
chapter
ix
sissy
s
progress
sissy
jupe
had
not
an
easy
time
of
it
between
m
choakumchild
and
gradgrind
and
was
not
without
strong
impulses
in
the
first
months
of
her
probation
to
run
away
it
hailed
facts
all
day
long
so
very
hard
and
life
in
general
was
opened
to
her
as
such
a
closely
ruled
that
assuredly
she
would
have
run
away
but
for
only
one
restraint
it
is
lamentable
to
think
of
but
this
restraint
was
the
result
of
no
arithmetical
process
was
in
defiance
of
all
calculation
and
went
dead
against
any
table
of
probabilities
that
any
actuary
would
have
drawn
up
from
the
premises
the
girl
believed
that
her
father
had
not
deserted
her
she
lived
in
the
hope
that
he
would
come
back
and
in
the
faith
that
he
would
be
made
the
happier
by
her
remaining
where
she
was
the
wretched
ignorance
with
which
jupe
clung
to
this
consolation
rejecting
the
superior
comfort
of
knowing
on
a
sound
arithmetical
basis
that
her
father
was
an
unnatural
vagabond
filled
gradgrind
with
pity
yet
what
was
to
be
done
m
choakumchild
reported
that
she
had
a
very
dense
head
for
figures
that
once
possessed
with
a
general
idea
of
the
globe
she
took
the
smallest
conceivable
interest
in
its
exact
measurements
that
she
was
extremely
slow
in
the
acquisition
of
dates
unless
some
pitiful
incident
happened
to
be
connected
therewith
that
she
would
burst
into
tears
on
being
required
by
the
mental
process
immediately
to
name
the
cost
of
two
hundred
and
muslin
caps
at
halfpenny
that
she
was
as
low
down
in
the
school
as
low
could
be
that
after
eight
weeks
of
induction
into
the
elements
of
political
economy
she
had
only
yesterday
been
set
right
by
a
prattler
three
feet
high
for
returning
to
the
question
what
is
the
first
principle
of
this
science
the
absurd
answer
to
do
unto
others
as
i
would
that
they
should
do
unto
gradgrind
observed
shaking
his
head
that
all
this
was
very
bad
that
it
showed
the
necessity
of
infinite
grinding
at
the
mill
of
knowledge
as
per
system
schedule
blue
book
report
and
tabular
statements
a
to
z
and
that
jupe
must
be
kept
to
so
jupe
was
kept
to
it
and
became
but
no
wiser
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
be
you
miss
louisa
she
said
one
night
when
louisa
had
endeavoured
to
make
her
perplexities
for
next
day
something
clearer
to
her
do
you
think
so
i
should
know
so
much
miss
louisa
all
that
is
difficult
to
me
now
would
be
so
easy
you
might
not
be
the
better
for
it
sissy
submitted
after
a
little
hesitation
i
should
not
be
the
worse
miss
to
which
miss
louisa
answered
i
don
t
know
there
had
been
so
little
communication
between
these
because
life
at
stone
lodge
went
monotonously
round
like
a
piece
of
machinery
which
discouraged
human
interference
and
because
of
the
prohibition
relative
to
sissy
s
past
they
were
still
almost
strangers
sissy
with
her
dark
eyes
wonderingly
directed
to
louisa
s
face
was
uncertain
whether
to
say
more
or
to
remain
silent
you
are
more
useful
to
my
mother
and
more
pleasant
with
her
than
i
can
ever
be
louisa
resumed
you
are
pleasanter
to
yourself
than
am
to
but
if
you
please
miss
louisa
sissy
pleaded
i
so
stupid
louisa
with
a
brighter
laugh
than
usual
told
her
she
would
be
wiser
you
don
t
know
said
sissy
half
crying
what
a
stupid
girl
i
am
all
through
school
hours
i
make
mistakes
and
m
choakumchild
call
me
up
over
and
over
again
regularly
to
make
mistakes
i
can
t
help
them
they
seem
to
come
natural
to
mr
and
m
choakumchild
never
make
any
mistakes
themselves
i
suppose
sissy
o
no
she
eagerly
returned
they
know
tell
me
some
of
your
i
am
almost
ashamed
said
sissy
with
reluctance
but
for
instance
m
choakumchild
was
explaining
to
us
about
natural
national
i
think
it
must
have
been
observed
louisa
yes
it
isn
t
it
the
same
she
timidly
asked
you
had
better
say
national
as
he
said
so
returned
louisa
with
her
dry
reserve
national
prosperity
and
he
said
now
this
schoolroom
is
a
nation
and
in
this
nation
there
are
fifty
millions
of
money
isn
t
this
a
prosperous
nation
girl
number
twenty
isn
t
this
a
prosperous
nation
and
a
n
t
you
in
a
thriving
state
what
did
you
say
asked
louisa
miss
louisa
i
said
i
didn
t
know
i
thought
i
couldn
t
know
whether
it
was
a
prosperous
nation
or
not
and
whether
i
was
in
a
thriving
state
or
not
unless
i
knew
who
had
got
the
money
and
whether
any
of
it
was
mine
but
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
was
not
in
the
figures
at
all
said
sissy
wiping
her
eyes
that
was
a
great
mistake
of
yours
observed
louisa
yes
miss
louisa
i
know
it
was
now
then
m
choakumchild
said
he
would
try
me
again
and
he
said
this
schoolroom
is
an
immense
town
and
in
it
there
are
a
million
of
inhabitants
and
only
are
starved
to
death
in
the
streets
in
the
course
of
a
year
what
is
your
remark
on
that
proportion
and
my
remark
i
couldn
t
think
of
a
better
i
thought
it
must
be
just
as
hard
upon
those
who
were
starved
whether
the
others
were
a
million
or
a
million
million
and
that
was
wrong
of
course
it
then
m
choakumchild
said
he
would
try
me
once
more
and
he
said
here
are
the
statistics
said
louisa
yes
miss
always
remind
me
of
stutterings
and
that
s
another
of
my
accidents
upon
the
sea
and
i
find
m
choakumchild
said
that
in
a
given
time
a
hundred
thousand
persons
went
to
sea
on
long
voyages
and
only
five
hundred
of
them
were
drowned
or
burnt
to
death
what
is
the
percentage
and
i
said
miss
here
sissy
fairly
sobbed
as
confessing
with
extreme
contrition
to
her
greatest
error
i
said
it
was
nothing
sissy
nothing
the
relations
and
friends
of
the
people
who
were
killed
i
shall
never
learn
said
sissy
and
the
worst
of
all
is
that
although
my
poor
father
wished
me
so
much
to
learn
and
although
i
am
so
anxious
to
learn
because
he
wished
me
to
i
am
afraid
i
don
t
like
louisa
stood
looking
at
the
pretty
modest
head
as
it
drooped
abashed
before
her
until
it
was
raised
again
to
glance
at
her
face
then
she
asked
did
your
father
know
so
much
himself
that
he
wished
you
to
be
well
taught
too
sissy
sissy
hesitated
before
replying
and
so
plainly
showed
her
sense
that
they
were
entering
on
forbidden
ground
that
louisa
added
no
one
hears
us
and
if
any
one
did
i
am
sure
no
harm
could
be
found
in
such
an
innocent
no
miss
louisa
answered
sissy
upon
this
encouragement
shaking
her
head
father
knows
very
little
indeed
it
s
as
much
as
he
can
do
to
write
and
it
s
more
than
people
in
general
can
do
to
read
his
writing
though
it
s
plain
to
your
mother
father
says
she
was
quite
a
scholar
she
died
when
i
was
born
she
was
sissy
made
the
terrible
communication
nervously
she
was
a
did
your
father
love
her
louisa
asked
these
questions
with
a
strong
wild
wandering
interest
peculiar
to
her
an
interest
gone
astray
like
a
banished
creature
and
hiding
in
solitary
places
o
yes
as
dearly
as
he
loves
me
father
loved
me
first
for
her
sake
he
carried
me
about
with
him
when
i
was
quite
a
baby
we
have
never
been
asunder
from
that
yet
he
leaves
you
now
sissy
only
for
my
good
nobody
understands
him
as
i
do
nobody
knows
him
as
i
do
when
he
left
me
for
my
never
would
have
left
me
for
his
know
he
was
almost
with
the
trial
he
will
not
be
happy
for
a
single
minute
till
he
comes
tell
me
more
about
him
said
louisa
i
will
never
ask
you
again
where
did
you
live
we
travelled
about
the
country
and
had
no
fixed
place
to
live
in
father
s
a
sissy
whispered
the
awful
word
a
to
make
the
people
laugh
said
louisa
with
a
nod
of
intelligence
yes
but
they
wouldn
t
laugh
sometimes
and
then
father
cried
lately
they
very
often
wouldn
t
laugh
and
he
used
to
come
home
despairing
father
s
not
like
most
those
who
didn
t
know
him
as
well
as
i
do
and
didn
t
love
him
as
dearly
as
i
do
might
believe
he
was
not
quite
right
sometimes
they
played
tricks
upon
him
but
they
never
knew
how
he
felt
them
and
shrunk
up
when
he
was
alone
with
me
he
was
far
far
timider
than
they
thought
and
you
were
his
comfort
through
everything
she
nodded
with
the
tears
rolling
down
her
face
i
hope
so
and
father
said
i
was
it
was
because
he
grew
so
scared
and
trembling
and
because
he
felt
himself
to
be
a
poor
weak
ignorant
helpless
man
those
used
to
be
his
words
that
he
wanted
me
so
much
to
know
a
great
deal
and
be
different
from
him
i
used
to
read
to
him
to
cheer
his
courage
and
he
was
very
fond
of
that
they
were
wrong
am
never
to
speak
of
them
we
didn
t
know
there
was
any
harm
in
and
he
liked
them
said
louisa
with
a
searching
gaze
on
sissy
all
this
time
o
very
much
they
kept
him
many
times
from
what
did
him
real
harm
and
often
and
often
of
a
night
he
used
to
forget
all
his
troubles
in
wondering
whether
the
sultan
would
let
the
lady
go
on
with
the
story
or
would
have
her
head
cut
off
before
it
was
and
your
father
was
always
kind
to
the
last
asked
louisa
contravening
the
great
principle
and
wondering
very
much
always
always
returned
sissy
clasping
her
hands
kinder
and
kinder
than
i
can
tell
he
was
angry
only
one
night
and
that
was
not
to
me
but
merrylegs
merrylegs
she
whispered
the
awful
fact
is
his
performing
why
was
he
angry
with
the
dog
louisa
demanded
father
soon
after
they
came
home
from
performing
told
merrylegs
to
jump
up
on
the
backs
of
the
two
chairs
and
stand
across
is
one
of
his
tricks
he
looked
at
father
and
didn
t
do
it
at
once
everything
of
father
s
had
gone
wrong
that
night
and
he
hadn
t
pleased
the
public
at
all
he
cried
out
that
the
very
dog
knew
he
was
failing
and
had
no
compassion
on
him
then
he
beat
the
dog
and
i
was
frightened
and
said
father
father
pray
don
t
hurt
the
creature
who
is
so
fond
of
you
o
heaven
forgive
you
father
stop
and
he
stopped
and
the
dog
was
bloody
and
father
lay
down
crying
on
the
floor
with
the
dog
in
his
arms
and
the
dog
licked
his
louisa
saw
that
she
was
sobbing
and
going
to
her
kissed
her
took
her
hand
and
sat
down
beside
her
finish
by
telling
me
how
your
father
left
you
sissy
now
that
i
have
asked
you
so
much
tell
me
the
end
the
blame
if
there
is
any
blame
is
mine
not
dear
miss
louisa
said
sissy
covering
her
eyes
and
sobbing
yet
i
came
home
from
the
school
that
afternoon
and
found
poor
father
just
come
home
too
from
the
booth
and
he
sat
rocking
himself
over
the
fire
as
if
he
was
in
pain
and
i
said
have
you
hurt
yourself
father
as
he
did
sometimes
like
they
all
did
and
he
said
a
little
my
and
when
i
came
to
stoop
down
and
look
up
at
his
face
i
saw
that
he
was
crying
the
more
i
spoke
to
him
the
more
he
hid
his
face
and
at
first
he
shook
all
over
and
said
nothing
but
my
darling
and
my
love
here
tom
came
lounging
in
and
stared
at
the
two
with
a
coolness
not
particularly
savouring
of
interest
in
anything
but
himself
and
not
much
of
that
at
present
i
am
asking
sissy
a
few
questions
tom
observed
his
sister
you
have
no
occasion
to
go
away
but
don
t
interrupt
us
for
a
moment
tom
oh
very
well
returned
tom
only
father
has
brought
old
bounderby
home
and
i
want
you
to
come
into
the
because
if
you
come
there
s
a
good
chance
of
old
bounderby
s
asking
me
to
dinner
and
if
you
don
t
there
s
i
ll
come
i
ll
wait
for
you
said
tom
to
make
sissy
resumed
in
a
lower
voice
at
last
poor
father
said
that
he
had
given
no
satisfaction
again
and
never
did
give
any
satisfaction
now
and
that
he
was
a
shame
and
disgrace
and
i
should
have
done
better
without
him
all
along
i
said
all
the
affectionate
things
to
him
that
came
into
my
heart
and
presently
he
was
quiet
and
i
sat
down
by
him
and
told
him
all
about
the
school
and
everything
that
had
been
said
and
done
there
when
i
had
no
more
left
to
tell
he
put
his
arms
round
my
neck
and
kissed
me
a
great
many
times
then
he
asked
me
to
fetch
some
of
the
stuff
he
used
for
the
little
hurt
he
had
had
and
to
get
it
at
the
best
place
which
was
at
the
other
end
of
town
from
there
and
then
after
kissing
me
again
he
let
me
go
when
i
had
gone
i
turned
back
that
i
might
be
a
little
bit
more
company
to
him
yet
and
looked
in
at
the
door
and
said
father
dear
shall
i
take
merrylegs
father
shook
his
head
and
said
no
sissy
no
take
nothing
that
s
known
to
be
mine
my
darling
and
i
left
him
sitting
by
the
fire
then
the
thought
must
have
come
upon
him
poor
poor
father
of
going
away
to
try
something
for
my
sake
for
when
i
came
back
he
was
i
say
look
sharp
for
old
bounderby
loo
tom
remonstrated
there
s
no
more
to
tell
miss
louisa
i
keep
the
nine
oils
ready
for
him
and
i
know
he
will
come
back
every
letter
that
i
see
in
gradgrind
s
hand
takes
my
breath
away
and
blinds
my
eyes
for
i
think
it
comes
from
father
or
from
sleary
about
father
sleary
promised
to
write
as
soon
as
ever
father
should
be
heard
of
and
i
trust
to
him
to
keep
his
do
look
sharp
for
old
bounderby
loo
said
tom
with
an
impatient
whistle
he
ll
be
off
if
you
don
t
look
sharp
after
this
whenever
sissy
dropped
a
curtsey
to
gradgrind
in
the
presence
of
his
family
and
said
in
a
faltering
way
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
for
being
you
had
any
letter
yet
about
me
louisa
would
suspend
the
occupation
of
the
moment
whatever
it
was
and
look
for
the
reply
as
earnestly
as
sissy
did
and
when
gradgrind
regularly
answered
no
jupe
nothing
of
the
sort
the
trembling
of
sissy
s
lip
would
be
repeated
in
louisa
s
face
and
her
eyes
would
follow
sissy
with
compassion
to
the
door
gradgrind
usually
improved
these
occasions
by
remarking
when
she
was
gone
that
if
jupe
had
been
properly
trained
from
an
early
age
she
would
have
remonstrated
to
herself
on
sound
principles
the
baselessness
of
these
fantastic
hopes
yet
it
did
seem
though
not
to
him
for
he
saw
nothing
of
it
as
if
fantastic
hope
could
take
as
strong
a
hold
as
fact
this
observation
must
be
limited
exclusively
to
his
daughter
as
to
tom
he
was
becoming
that
not
unprecedented
triumph
of
calculation
which
is
usually
at
work
on
number
one
as
to
gradgrind
if
she
said
anything
on
the
subject
she
would
come
a
little
way
out
of
her
wrappers
like
a
feminine
dormouse
and
say
good
gracious
bless
me
how
my
poor
head
is
vexed
and
worried
by
that
girl
jupe
s
so
perseveringly
asking
over
and
over
again
about
her
tiresome
letters
upon
my
word
and
honour
i
seem
to
be
fated
and
destined
and
ordained
to
live
in
the
midst
of
things
that
i
am
never
to
hear
the
last
of
it
really
is
a
most
extraordinary
circumstance
that
it
appears
as
if
i
never
was
to
hear
the
last
of
anything
at
about
this
point
gradgrind
s
eye
would
fall
upon
her
and
under
the
influence
of
that
wintry
piece
of
fact
she
would
become
torpid
again
chapter

stephen
blackpool
i
entertain
a
weak
idea
that
the
english
people
are
as
as
any
people
upon
whom
the
sun
shines
i
acknowledge
to
this
ridiculous
idiosyncrasy
as
a
reason
why
i
would
give
them
a
little
more
play
in
the
hardest
working
part
of
coketown
in
the
innermost
fortifications
of
that
ugly
citadel
where
nature
was
as
strongly
bricked
out
as
killing
airs
and
gases
were
bricked
in
at
the
heart
of
the
labyrinth
of
narrow
courts
upon
courts
and
close
streets
upon
streets
which
had
come
into
existence
piecemeal
every
piece
in
a
violent
hurry
for
some
one
man
s
purpose
and
the
whole
an
unnatural
family
shouldering
and
trampling
and
pressing
one
another
to
death
in
the
last
close
nook
of
this
great
exhausted
receiver
where
the
chimneys
for
want
of
air
to
make
a
draught
were
built
in
an
immense
variety
of
stunted
and
crooked
shapes
as
though
every
house
put
out
a
sign
of
the
kind
of
people
who
might
be
expected
to
be
born
in
it
among
the
multitude
of
coketown
generically
called
the
hands
race
who
would
have
found
more
favour
with
some
people
if
providence
had
seen
fit
to
make
them
only
hands
or
like
the
lower
creatures
of
the
seashore
only
hands
and
a
certain
stephen
blackpool
forty
years
of
age
stephen
looked
older
but
he
had
had
a
hard
life
it
is
said
that
every
life
has
its
roses
and
thorns
there
seemed
however
to
have
been
a
misadventure
or
mistake
in
stephen
s
case
whereby
somebody
else
had
become
possessed
of
his
roses
and
he
had
become
possessed
of
the
same
somebody
else
s
thorns
in
addition
to
his
own
he
had
known
to
use
his
words
a
peck
of
trouble
he
was
usually
called
old
stephen
in
a
kind
of
rough
homage
to
the
fact
a
rather
stooping
man
with
a
knitted
brow
a
pondering
expression
of
face
and
a
head
sufficiently
capacious
on
which
his
hair
lay
long
and
thin
old
stephen
might
have
passed
for
a
particularly
intelligent
man
in
his
condition
yet
he
was
not
he
took
no
place
among
those
remarkable
hands
who
piecing
together
their
broken
intervals
of
leisure
through
many
years
had
mastered
difficult
sciences
and
acquired
a
knowledge
of
most
unlikely
things
he
held
no
station
among
the
hands
who
could
make
speeches
and
carry
on
debates
thousands
of
his
compeers
could
talk
much
better
than
he
at
any
time
he
was
a
good
weaver
and
a
man
of
perfect
integrity
what
more
he
was
or
what
else
he
had
in
him
if
anything
let
him
show
for
himself
the
lights
in
the
great
factories
which
looked
when
they
were
illuminated
like
fairy
the
travellers
by
said
all
extinguished
and
the
bells
had
rung
for
knocking
off
for
the
night
and
had
ceased
again
and
the
hands
men
and
women
boy
and
girl
were
clattering
home
old
stephen
was
standing
in
the
street
with
the
old
sensation
upon
him
which
the
stoppage
of
the
machinery
always
sensation
of
its
having
worked
and
stopped
in
his
own
head
yet
i
don
t
see
rachael
still
said
he
it
was
a
wet
night
and
many
groups
of
young
women
passed
him
with
their
shawls
drawn
over
their
bare
heads
and
held
close
under
their
chins
to
keep
the
rain
out
he
knew
rachael
well
for
a
glance
at
any
one
of
these
groups
was
sufficient
to
show
him
that
she
was
not
there
at
last
there
were
no
more
to
come
and
then
he
turned
away
saying
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
why
then
ha
missed
her
but
he
had
not
gone
the
length
of
three
streets
when
he
saw
another
of
the
shawled
figures
in
advance
of
him
at
which
he
looked
so
keenly
that
perhaps
its
mere
shadow
indistinctly
reflected
on
the
wet
he
could
have
seen
it
without
the
figure
itself
moving
along
from
lamp
to
lamp
brightening
and
fading
as
it
have
been
enough
to
tell
him
who
was
there
making
his
pace
at
once
much
quicker
and
much
softer
he
darted
on
until
he
was
very
near
this
figure
then
fell
into
his
former
walk
and
called
rachael
she
turned
being
then
in
the
brightness
of
a
lamp
and
raising
her
hood
a
little
showed
a
quiet
oval
face
dark
and
rather
delicate
irradiated
by
a
pair
of
very
gentle
eyes
and
further
set
off
by
the
perfect
order
of
her
shining
black
hair
it
was
not
a
face
in
its
first
bloom
she
was
a
woman
five
and
thirty
years
of
age
ah
lad
tis
thou
when
she
had
said
this
with
a
smile
which
would
have
been
quite
expressed
though
nothing
of
her
had
been
seen
but
her
pleasant
eyes
she
replaced
her
hood
again
and
they
went
on
together
i
thought
thou
wast
ahind
me
rachael
early
t
night
lass
times
i
m
a
little
early
stephen
times
a
little
late
i
m
never
to
be
counted
on
going
nor
going
t
other
way
neither
t
seems
to
me
rachael
no
he
looked
at
her
with
some
disappointment
in
his
face
but
with
a
respectful
and
patient
conviction
that
she
must
be
right
in
whatever
she
did
the
expression
was
not
lost
upon
her
she
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
his
arm
a
moment
as
if
to
thank
him
for
it
we
are
such
true
friends
lad
and
such
old
friends
and
getting
to
be
such
old
folk
no
rachael
thou
rt
as
young
as
ever
thou
one
of
us
would
be
puzzled
how
to
get
old
stephen
without
t
other
getting
so
too
both
being
alive
she
answered
laughing
but
anyways
we
re
such
old
friends
and
t
hide
a
word
of
honest
truth
fro
one
another
would
be
a
sin
and
a
pity
tis
better
not
to
walk
too
much
together
times
yes
twould
be
hard
indeed
if
twas
not
to
be
at
all
she
said
with
a
cheerfulness
she
sought
to
communicate
to
him
tis
hard
anyways
try
to
think
not
and
twill
seem
i
ve
tried
a
long
time
and
ta
nt
got
better
but
thou
rt
right
t
might
mak
fok
talk
even
of
thee
thou
hast
been
that
to
me
rachael
through
so
many
year
thou
hast
done
me
so
much
good
and
heartened
of
me
in
that
cheering
way
that
thy
word
is
a
law
to
me
ah
lass
and
a
bright
good
law
better
than
some
real
never
fret
about
them
stephen
she
answered
quickly
and
not
without
an
anxious
glance
at
his
face
let
the
laws
yes
he
said
with
a
slow
nod
or
two
let
em
be
let
everything
be
let
all
sorts
alone
tis
a
muddle
and
that
s
always
a
muddle
said
rachael
with
another
gentle
touch
upon
his
arm
as
if
to
recall
him
out
of
the
thoughtfulness
in
which
he
was
biting
the
long
ends
of
his
loose
neckerchief
as
he
walked
along
the
touch
had
its
instantaneous
effect
he
let
them
fall
turned
a
smiling
face
upon
her
and
said
as
he
broke
into
a
laugh
ay
rachael
lass
awlus
a
muddle
that
s
where
i
stick
i
come
to
the
muddle
many
times
and
agen
and
i
never
get
beyond
they
had
walked
some
distance
and
were
near
their
own
homes
the
woman
s
was
the
first
reached
it
was
in
one
of
the
many
small
streets
for
which
the
favourite
undertaker
who
turned
a
handsome
sum
out
of
the
one
poor
ghastly
pomp
of
the
neighbourhood
kept
a
black
ladder
in
order
that
those
who
had
done
their
daily
groping
up
and
down
the
narrow
stairs
might
slide
out
of
this
working
world
by
the
windows
she
stopped
at
the
corner
and
putting
her
hand
in
his
wished
him
good
night
good
night
dear
lass
good
night
she
went
with
her
neat
figure
and
her
sober
womanly
step
down
the
dark
street
and
he
stood
looking
after
her
until
she
turned
into
one
of
the
small
houses
there
was
not
a
flutter
of
her
coarse
shawl
perhaps
but
had
its
interest
in
this
man
s
eyes
not
a
tone
of
her
voice
but
had
its
echo
in
his
innermost
heart
when
she
was
lost
to
his
view
he
pursued
his
homeward
way
glancing
up
sometimes
at
the
sky
where
the
clouds
were
sailing
fast
and
wildly
but
they
were
broken
now
and
the
rain
had
ceased
and
the
moon
shone
down
the
high
chimneys
of
coketown
on
the
deep
furnaces
below
and
casting
titanic
shadows
of
the
at
rest
upon
the
walls
where
they
were
lodged
the
man
seemed
to
have
brightened
with
the
night
as
he
went
on
his
home
in
such
another
street
as
the
first
saving
that
it
was
narrower
was
over
a
little
shop
how
it
came
to
pass
that
any
people
found
it
worth
their
while
to
sell
or
buy
the
wretched
little
toys
mixed
up
in
its
window
with
cheap
newspapers
and
pork
there
was
a
leg
to
be
raffled
for
matters
not
here
he
took
his
end
of
candle
from
a
shelf
lighted
it
at
another
end
of
candle
on
the
counter
without
disturbing
the
mistress
of
the
shop
who
was
asleep
in
her
little
room
and
went
upstairs
into
his
lodging
it
was
a
room
not
unacquainted
with
the
black
ladder
under
various
tenants
but
as
neat
at
present
as
such
a
room
could
be
a
few
books
and
writings
were
on
an
old
bureau
in
a
corner
the
furniture
was
decent
and
sufficient
and
though
the
atmosphere
was
tainted
the
room
was
clean
going
to
the
hearth
to
set
the
candle
down
upon
a
round
table
standing
there
he
stumbled
against
something
as
he
recoiled
looking
down
at
it
it
raised
itself
up
into
the
form
of
a
woman
in
a
sitting
attitude
heaven
s
mercy
woman
he
cried
falling
farther
off
from
the
figure
hast
thou
come
back
again
such
a
woman
a
disabled
drunken
creature
barely
able
to
preserve
her
sitting
posture
by
steadying
herself
with
one
begrimed
hand
on
the
floor
while
the
other
was
so
purposeless
in
trying
to
push
away
her
tangled
hair
from
her
face
that
it
only
blinded
her
the
more
with
the
dirt
upon
it
a
creature
so
foul
to
look
at
in
her
tatters
stains
and
splashes
but
so
much
fouler
than
that
in
her
moral
infamy
that
it
was
a
shameful
thing
even
to
see
her
after
an
impatient
oath
or
two
and
some
stupid
clawing
of
herself
with
the
hand
not
necessary
to
her
support
she
got
her
hair
away
from
her
eyes
sufficiently
to
obtain
a
sight
of
him
then
she
sat
swaying
her
body
to
and
fro
and
making
gestures
with
her
unnerved
arm
which
seemed
intended
as
the
accompaniment
to
a
fit
of
laughter
though
her
face
was
stolid
and
drowsy
eigh
lad
what
yo
r
there
some
hoarse
sounds
meant
for
this
came
mockingly
out
of
her
at
last
and
her
head
dropped
forward
on
her
breast
back
agen
she
screeched
after
some
minutes
as
if
he
had
that
moment
said
it
yes
and
back
agen
back
agen
ever
and
ever
so
often
back
yes
back
why
not
roused
by
the
unmeaning
violence
with
which
she
cried
it
out
she
scrambled
up
and
stood
supporting
herself
with
her
shoulders
against
the
wall
dangling
in
one
hand
by
the
string
a
of
a
bonnet
and
trying
to
look
scornfully
at
him
i
ll
sell
thee
off
again
and
i
ll
sell
thee
off
again
and
i
ll
sell
thee
off
a
score
of
times
she
cried
with
something
between
a
furious
menace
and
an
effort
at
a
defiant
dance
come
awa
from
th
bed
he
was
sitting
on
the
side
of
it
with
his
face
hidden
in
his
hands
come
awa
from
t
tis
mine
and
i
ve
a
right
to
t
as
she
staggered
to
it
he
avoided
her
with
a
shudder
and
face
still
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
she
threw
herself
upon
the
bed
heavily
and
soon
was
snoring
hard
he
sunk
into
a
chair
and
moved
but
once
all
that
night
it
was
to
throw
a
covering
over
her
as
if
his
hands
were
not
enough
to
hide
her
even
in
the
darkness
chapter
xi
no
way
out
the
fairy
palaces
burst
into
illumination
before
pale
morning
showed
the
monstrous
serpents
of
smoke
trailing
themselves
over
coketown
a
clattering
of
clogs
upon
the
pavement
a
rapid
ringing
of
bells
and
all
the
melancholy
mad
elephants
polished
and
oiled
up
for
the
day
s
monotony
were
at
their
heavy
exercise
again
stephen
bent
over
his
loom
quiet
watchful
and
steady
a
special
contrast
as
every
man
was
in
the
forest
of
looms
where
stephen
worked
to
the
crashing
smashing
tearing
piece
of
mechanism
at
which
he
laboured
never
fear
good
people
of
an
anxious
turn
of
mind
that
art
will
consign
nature
to
oblivion
set
anywhere
side
by
side
the
work
of
god
and
the
work
of
man
and
the
former
even
though
it
be
a
troop
of
hands
of
very
small
account
will
gain
in
dignity
from
the
comparison
so
many
hundred
hands
in
this
mill
so
many
hundred
horse
steam
power
it
is
known
to
the
force
of
a
single
pound
weight
what
the
engine
will
do
but
not
all
the
calculators
of
the
national
debt
can
tell
me
the
capacity
for
good
or
evil
for
love
or
hatred
for
patriotism
or
discontent
for
the
decomposition
of
virtue
into
vice
or
the
reverse
at
any
single
moment
in
the
soul
of
one
of
these
its
quiet
servants
with
the
composed
faces
and
the
regulated
actions
there
is
no
mystery
in
it
there
is
an
unfathomable
mystery
in
the
meanest
of
them
for
we
were
to
reverse
our
arithmetic
for
material
objects
and
to
govern
these
awful
unknown
quantities
by
other
means
the
day
grew
strong
and
showed
itself
outside
even
against
the
flaming
lights
within
the
lights
were
turned
out
and
the
work
went
on
the
rain
fell
and
the
submissive
to
the
curse
of
all
that
tribe
trailed
themselves
upon
the
earth
in
the
outside
the
steam
from
the
escape
pipe
the
litter
of
barrels
and
old
iron
the
shining
heaps
of
coals
the
ashes
everywhere
were
shrouded
in
a
veil
of
mist
and
rain
the
work
went
on
until
the
rang
more
clattering
upon
the
pavements
the
looms
and
wheels
and
hands
all
out
of
gear
for
an
hour
stephen
came
out
of
the
hot
mill
into
the
damp
wind
and
cold
wet
streets
haggard
and
worn
he
turned
from
his
own
class
and
his
own
quarter
taking
nothing
but
a
little
bread
as
he
walked
along
towards
the
hill
on
which
his
principal
employer
lived
in
a
red
house
with
black
outside
shutters
green
inside
blinds
a
black
street
door
up
two
white
steps
bounderby
in
letters
very
like
himself
upon
a
brazen
plate
and
a
round
brazen
underneath
it
like
a
brazen
bounderby
was
at
his
lunch
so
stephen
had
expected
would
his
servant
say
that
one
of
the
hands
begged
leave
to
speak
to
him
message
in
return
requiring
name
of
such
hand
stephen
blackpool
there
was
nothing
troublesome
against
stephen
blackpool
yes
he
might
come
in
stephen
blackpool
in
the
parlour
bounderby
whom
he
just
knew
by
sight
at
lunch
on
chop
and
sherry
sparsit
netting
at
the
fireside
in
a
attitude
with
one
foot
in
a
cotton
stirrup
it
was
a
part
at
once
of
sparsit
s
dignity
and
service
not
to
lunch
she
supervised
the
meal
officially
but
implied
that
in
her
own
stately
person
she
considered
lunch
a
weakness
now
stephen
said
bounderby
what
s
the
matter
with
stephen
made
a
bow
not
a
servile
hands
will
never
do
that
lord
bless
you
sir
you
ll
never
catch
them
at
that
if
they
have
been
with
you
twenty
years
as
a
complimentary
toilet
for
sparsit
tucked
his
neckerchief
ends
into
his
waistcoat
now
you
know
said
bounderby
taking
some
sherry
we
have
never
had
any
difficulty
with
you
and
you
have
never
been
one
of
the
unreasonable
ones
you
don
t
expect
to
be
set
up
in
a
coach
and
six
and
to
be
fed
on
turtle
soup
and
venison
with
a
gold
spoon
as
a
good
many
of
em
do
bounderby
always
represented
this
to
be
the
sole
immediate
and
direct
object
of
any
hand
who
was
not
entirely
satisfied
and
therefore
i
know
already
that
you
have
not
come
here
to
make
a
complaint
now
you
know
i
am
certain
of
that
no
sir
sure
i
ha
not
coom
for
nowt
o
th
bounderby
seemed
agreeably
surprised
notwithstanding
his
previous
strong
conviction
very
well
he
returned
you
re
a
steady
hand
and
i
was
not
mistaken
now
let
me
hear
what
it
s
all
about
as
it
s
not
that
let
me
hear
what
it
is
what
have
you
got
to
say
out
with
it
lad
stephen
happened
to
glance
towards
sparsit
i
can
go
bounderby
if
you
wish
it
said
that
lady
making
a
feint
of
taking
her
foot
out
of
the
stirrup
bounderby
stayed
her
by
holding
a
mouthful
of
chop
in
suspension
before
swallowing
it
and
putting
out
his
left
hand
then
withdrawing
his
hand
and
swallowing
his
mouthful
of
chop
he
said
to
stephen
now
you
know
this
good
lady
is
a
born
lady
a
high
lady
you
are
not
to
suppose
because

keeps
my
house
for
me
that
she
hasn
t
been
very
high
up
the
up
at
the
top
of
the
tree
now
if
you
have
got
anything
to
say
that
can
t
be
said
before
a
born
lady
this
lady
will
leave
the
room
if
what
you
have
got
to
say
be
said
before
a
born
lady
this
lady
will

the
reply

with

bounderby
pushing
away

plate
and
leaning
back

for
the
moment
like
a
proud
man
in
another
moment
he
stood
as
he
had
stood
all
the
usual
stoop
upon
him
his
pondering
face
addressed
to
bounderby
with
a
curious
expression
on
it
half
shrewd
half
perplexed
as
if
his
mind
were
set
upon
unravelling
something
very
difficult
his
hat
held
tight
in
his
left
hand
which
rested
on
his
hip
his
right
arm
with
a
rugged
propriety
and
force
of
action
very
earnestly
emphasizing
what
he
said
not
least
so
when
it
always
paused
a
little
bent
but
not
withdrawn
as
he
paused
i
was
acquainted
with
all
this
you
know
said
bounderby
except
the
last
clause
long
ago
it
s
a
bad
job
that
s
what
it
is
you
had
better
have
been
satisfied
as
you
were
and
not
have
got
married
however
it
s
too
late
to
say
was
it
an
unequal
marriage
sir
in
point
of
years
asked
sparsit
you
hear
what
this
lady
asks
was
it
an
unequal
marriage
in
point
of
years
this
unlucky
job
of
yours
said
bounderby
not
e
en
so
i
were
myseln
she
were
twenty
indeed
sir
said
sparsit
to
her
chief
with
great
placidity
i
inferred
from
its
being
so
miserable
a
marriage
that
it
was
probably
an
unequal
one
in
point
of
bounderby
looked
very
hard
at
the
good
lady
in
a
way
that
had
an
odd
sheepishness
about
it
he
fortified
himself
with
a
little
more
sherry
well
why
don
t
you
go
on
he
then
asked
turning
rather
irritably
on
stephen
blackpool
i
ha
coom
to
ask
yo
sir
how
i
am
to
be
ridded
o
this
stephen
infused
a
yet
deeper
gravity
into
the
mixed
expression
of
his
attentive
face
sparsit
uttered
a
gentle
ejaculation
as
having
received
a
moral
shock
what
do
you
mean
said
bounderby
getting
up
to
lean
his
back
against
the
what
are

talking
about

i
tell

what
said
bounderby
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
there
such
a
stephen
subsiding
into
his
quiet
manner
and
never
wandering
in
his
attention
gave
a
nod
but
it
s
not
for
you
at
all
it
costs
money
it
costs
a
mint
of
how
much
might
that
be
stephen
calmly
asked
why
you
d
have
to
go
to
doctors
commons
with
a
suit
and
you
d
have
to
go
to
a
court
of
common
law
with
a
suit
and
you
d
have
to
go
to
the
house
of
lords
with
a
suit
and
you
d
have
to
get
an
act
of
parliament
to
enable
you
to
marry
again
and
it
would
cost
you
if
it
was
a
case
of
very
plain
sailing
i
suppose
from
a
thousand
to
fifteen
hundred
pound
said
bounderby
perhaps
twice
the
there
s
no
other
law
certainly
why
then
sir
said
stephen
turning
white
and
motioning
with
that
right
hand
of
his
as
if
he
gave
everything
to
the
four
winds
a
muddle
tis
just
a
muddle
a
toogether
an
the
sooner
i
am
dead
the
sparsit
again
dejected
by
the
impiety
of
the
people
pooh
pooh
don
t
you
talk
nonsense
my
good
fellow
said
bounderby
about
things
you
don
t
understand
and
don
t
you
call
the
institutions
of
your
country
a
muddle
or
you
ll
get
yourself
into
a
real
muddle
one
of
these
fine
mornings
the
institutions
of
your
country
are
not
your
and
the
only
thing
you
have
got
to
do
is
to
mind
your
you
didn
t
take
your
wife
for
fast
and
for
loose
but
for
better
for
worse
if
she
has
turned
out
all
we
have
got
to
say
is
she
might
have
turned
out
tis
a
muddle
said
stephen
shaking
his
head
as
he
moved
to
the
door
tis
a
a
muddle
now
i
ll
tell
you
what
bounderby
resumed
as
a
valedictory
address
with
what
i
shall
call
your
unhallowed
opinions
you
have
been
quite
shocking
this
lady
who
as
i
have
already
told
you
is
a
born
lady
and
who
as
i
have
not
already
told
you
has
had
her
own
marriage
misfortunes
to
the
tune
of
tens
of
thousands
of
of
thousands
of
pounds
he
repeated
it
with
great
relish
now
you
have
always
been
a
steady
hand
hitherto
but
my
opinion
is
and
so
i
tell
you
plainly
that
you
are
turning
into
the
wrong
road
you
have
been
listening
to
some
mischievous
stranger
or
re
always
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
come
out
of
that
now
you
know
here
his
countenance
expressed
marvellous
acuteness
i
can
see
as
far
into
a
grindstone
as
another
man
farther
than
a
good
many
perhaps
because
i
had
my
nose
well
kept
to
it
when
i
was
young
i
see
traces
of
the
turtle
soup
and
venison
and
gold
spoon
in
this
yes
i
do
cried
bounderby
shaking
his
head
with
obstinate
cunning
by
the
lord
harry
i
do
with
a
very
different
shake
of
the
head
and
deep
sigh
stephen
said
thank
you
sir
i
wish
you
good
so
he
left
bounderby
swelling
at
his
own
portrait
on
the
wall
as
if
he
were
going
to
explode
himself
into
it
and
sparsit
still
ambling
on
with
her
foot
in
her
stirrup
looking
quite
cast
down
by
the
popular
vices
chapter
xii
the
old
woman
old
stephen
descended
the
two
white
steps
shutting
the
black
door
with
the
brazen
by
the
aid
of
the
brazen
to
which
he
gave
a
parting
polish
with
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
observing
that
his
hot
hand
clouded
it
he
crossed
the
street
with
his
eyes
bent
upon
the
ground
and
thus
was
walking
sorrowfully
away
when
he
felt
a
touch
upon
his
arm
it
was
not
the
touch
he
needed
most
at
such
a
touch
that
could
calm
the
wild
waters
of
his
soul
as
the
uplifted
hand
of
the
sublimest
love
and
patience
could
abate
the
raging
of
the
it
was
a
woman
s
hand
too
it
was
an
old
woman
tall
and
shapely
still
though
withered
by
time
on
whom
his
eyes
fell
when
he
stopped
and
turned
she
was
very
cleanly
and
plainly
dressed
had
country
mud
upon
her
shoes
and
was
newly
come
from
a
journey
the
flutter
of
her
manner
in
the
unwonted
noise
of
the
streets
the
spare
shawl
carried
unfolded
on
her
arm
the
heavy
umbrella
and
little
basket
the
loose
gloves
to
which
her
hands
were
unused
all
bespoke
an
old
woman
from
the
country
in
her
plain
holiday
clothes
come
into
coketown
on
an
expedition
of
rare
occurrence
remarking
this
at
a
glance
with
the
quick
observation
of
his
class
stephen
blackpool
bent
his
attentive
face
which
like
the
faces
of
many
of
his
order
by
dint
of
long
working
with
eyes
and
hands
in
the
midst
of
a
prodigious
noise
had
acquired
the
concentrated
look
with
which
we
are
familiar
in
the
countenances
of
the
better
to
hear
what
she
asked
him
pray
sir
said
the
old
woman
didn
t
i
see
you
come
out
of
that
gentleman
s
house
pointing
back
to
bounderby
s
i
believe
it
was
you
unless
i
have
had
the
bad
luck
to
mistake
the
person
in
following
yes
missus
returned
stephen
it
were
have
ll
excuse
an
old
woman
s
you
seen
the
gentleman
yes
and
how
did
he
look
sir
was
he
portly
bold
outspoken
and
hearty
as
she
straightened
her
own
figure
and
held
up
her
head
in
adapting
her
action
to
her
words
the
idea
crossed
stephen
that
he
had
seen
this
old
woman
before
and
had
not
quite
liked
her
o
yes
he
returned
observing
her
more
attentively
he
were
all
and
healthy
said
the
old
woman
as
the
fresh
wind
yes
returned
stephen
he
were
ett
n
and
large
and
as
loud
as
a
thank
you
said
the
old
woman
with
infinite
content
thank
you
he
certainly
never
had
seen
this
old
woman
before
yet
there
was
a
vague
remembrance
in
his
mind
as
if
he
had
more
than
once
dreamed
of
some
old
woman
like
her
she
walked
along
at
his
side
and
gently
accommodating
himself
to
her
humour
he
said
coketown
was
a
busy
place
was
it
not
to
which
she
answered
eigh
sure
dreadful
busy
then
he
said
she
came
from
the
country
he
saw
to
which
she
answered
in
the
affirmative
by
parliamentary
this
morning
i
came
forty
mile
by
parliamentary
this
morning
and
i
m
going
back
the
same
forty
mile
this
afternoon
i
walked
nine
mile
to
the
station
this
morning
and
if
i
find
nobody
on
the
road
to
give
me
a
lift
i
shall
walk
the
nine
mile
back
that
s
pretty
well
sir
at
my
age
said
the
chatty
old
woman
her
eye
brightening
with
exultation
deed
tis
don
t
do
t
too
often
no
no
once
a
year
she
answered
shaking
her
head
i
spend
my
savings
so
once
every
year
i
come
regular
to
tramp
about
the
streets
and
see
the
only
to
see
em
returned
stephen
that
s
enough
for
me
she
replied
with
great
earnestness
and
interest
of
manner
i
ask
no
more
i
have
been
standing
about
on
this
side
of
the
way
to
see
that
gentleman
turning
her
head
back
towards
bounderby
s
again
come
out
but
he
s
late
this
year
and
i
have
not
seen
him
you
came
out
instead
now
if
i
am
obliged
to
go
back
without
a
glimpse
of
only
want
a
i
have
seen
you
and
you
have
seen
him
and
i
must
make
that
saying
this
she
looked
at
stephen
as
if
to
fix
his
features
in
her
mind
and
her
eye
was
not
so
bright
as
it
had
been
with
a
large
allowance
for
difference
of
tastes
and
with
all
submission
to
the
patricians
of
coketown
this
seemed
so
extraordinary
a
source
of
interest
to
take
so
much
trouble
about
that
it
perplexed
him
but
they
were
passing
the
church
now
and
as
his
eye
caught
the
clock
he
quickened
his
pace
he
was
going
to
his
work
the
old
woman
said
quickening
hers
too
quite
easily
yes
time
was
nearly
out
on
his
telling
her
where
he
worked
the
old
woman
became
a
more
singular
old
woman
than
before
an
t
you
happy
she
asked
him
s
awmost
nobbody
but
has
their
troubles
he
answered
evasively
because
the
old
woman
appeared
to
take
it
for
granted
that
he
would
be
very
happy
indeed
and
he
had
not
the
heart
to
disappoint
her
he
knew
that
there
was
trouble
enough
in
the
world
and
if
the
old
woman
had
lived
so
long
and
could
count
upon
his
having
so
little
why
so
much
the
better
for
her
and
none
the
worse
for
him
ay
ay
you
have
your
troubles
at
home
you
mean
she
said
times
just
now
and
then
he
answered
slightly
but
working
under
such
a
gentleman
they
don
t
follow
you
to
the
factory
no
no
they
didn
t
follow
him
there
said
stephen
all
correct
there
everything
accordant
there
he
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
for
her
pleasure
that
there
was
a
sort
of
divine
right
there
but
i
have
heard
claims
almost
as
magnificent
of
late
years
they
were
now
in
the
black
near
the
place
and
the
hands
were
crowding
in
the
bell
was
ringing
and
the
serpent
was
a
serpent
of
many
coils
and
the
elephant
was
getting
ready
the
strange
old
woman
was
delighted
with
the
very
bell
it
was
the
beautifullest
bell
she
had
ever
heard
she
said
and
sounded
grand
she
asked
him
when
he
stopped
to
shake
hands
with
her
before
going
in
how
long
he
had
worked
there
a
dozen
year
he
told
her
i
must
kiss
the
hand
said
she
that
has
worked
in
this
fine
factory
for
a
dozen
year
and
she
lifted
it
though
he
would
have
prevented
her
and
put
it
to
her
lips
what
harmony
besides
her
age
and
her
simplicity
surrounded
her
he
did
not
know
but
even
in
this
fantastic
action
there
was
a
something
neither
out
of
time
nor
place
a
something
which
it
seemed
as
if
nobody
else
could
have
made
as
serious
or
done
with
such
a
natural
and
touching
air
he
had
been
at
his
loom
full
half
an
hour
thinking
about
this
old
woman
when
having
occasion
to
move
round
the
loom
for
its
adjustment
he
glanced
through
a
window
which
was
in
his
corner
and
saw
her
still
looking
up
at
the
pile
of
building
lost
in
admiration
heedless
of
the
smoke
and
mud
and
wet
and
of
her
two
long
journeys
she
was
gazing
at
it
as
if
the
heavy
thrum
that
issued
from
its
many
stories
were
proud
music
to
her
she
was
gone
by
and
by
and
the
day
went
after
her
and
the
lights
sprung
up
again
and
the
express
whirled
in
full
sight
of
the
fairy
palace
over
the
arches
near
little
felt
amid
the
jarring
of
the
machinery
and
scarcely
heard
above
its
crash
and
rattle
long
before
then
his
thoughts
had
gone
back
to
the
dreary
room
above
the
little
shop
and
to
the
shameful
figure
heavy
on
the
bed
but
heavier
on
his
heart
machinery
slackened
throbbing
feebly
like
a
fainting
pulse
stopped
the
bell
again
the
glare
of
light
and
heat
dispelled
the
factories
looming
heavy
in
the
black
wet
tall
chimneys
rising
up
into
the
air
like
competing
towers
of
babel
he
had
spoken
to
rachael
only
last
night
it
was
true
and
had
walked
with
her
a
little
way
but
he
had
his
new
misfortune
on
him
in
which
no
one
else
could
give
him
a
moment
s
relief
and
for
the
sake
of
it
and
because
he
knew
himself
to
want
that
softening
of
his
anger
which
no
voice
but
hers
could
effect
he
felt
he
might
so
far
disregard
what
she
had
said
as
to
wait
for
her
again
he
waited
but
she
had
eluded
him
she
was
gone
on
no
other
night
in
the
year
could
he
so
ill
have
spared
her
patient
face
o
better
to
have
no
home
in
which
to
lay
his
head
than
to
have
a
home
and
dread
to
go
to
it
through
such
a
cause
he
ate
and
drank
for
he
was
he
little
knew
or
cared
what
and
he
wandered
about
in
the
chill
rain
thinking
and
thinking
and
brooding
and
brooding
no
word
of
a
new
marriage
had
ever
passed
between
them
but
rachael
had
taken
great
pity
on
him
years
ago
and
to
her
alone
he
had
opened
his
closed
heart
all
this
time
on
the
subject
of
his
miseries
and
he
knew
very
well
that
if
he
were
free
to
ask
her
she
would
take
him
he
thought
of
the
home
he
might
at
that
moment
have
been
seeking
with
pleasure
and
pride
of
the
different
man
he
might
have
been
that
night
of
the
lightness
then
in
his
now
breast
of
the
then
restored
honour
and
tranquillity
all
torn
to
pieces
he
thought
of
the
waste
of
the
best
part
of
his
life
of
the
change
it
made
in
his
character
for
the
worse
every
day
of
the
dreadful
nature
of
his
existence
bound
hand
and
foot
to
a
dead
woman
and
tormented
by
a
demon
in
her
shape
he
thought
of
rachael
how
young
when
they
were
first
brought
together
in
these
circumstances
how
mature
now
how
soon
to
grow
old
he
thought
of
the
number
of
girls
and
women
she
had
seen
marry
how
many
homes
with
children
in
them
she
had
seen
grow
up
around
her
how
she
had
contentedly
pursued
her
own
lone
quiet
how
he
had
sometimes
seen
a
shade
of
melancholy
on
her
blessed
face
that
smote
him
with
remorse
and
despair
he
set
the
picture
of
her
up
beside
the
infamous
image
of
last
night
and
thought
could
it
be
that
the
whole
earthly
course
of
one
so
gentle
good
and
was
subjugate
to
such
a
wretch
as
that
filled
with
these
filled
that
he
had
an
unwholesome
sense
of
growing
larger
of
being
placed
in
some
new
and
diseased
relation
towards
the
objects
among
which
he
passed
of
seeing
the
iris
round
every
misty
light
turn
went
home
for
shelter
chapter
xiii
rachael
a
candle
faintly
burned
in
the
window
to
which
the
black
ladder
had
often
been
raised
for
the
sliding
away
of
all
that
was
most
precious
in
this
world
to
a
striving
wife
and
a
brood
of
hungry
babies
and
stephen
added
to
his
other
thoughts
the
stern
reflection
that
of
all
the
casualties
of
this
existence
upon
earth
not
one
was
dealt
out
with
so
unequal
a
hand
as
death
the
inequality
of
birth
was
nothing
to
it
for
say
that
the
child
of
a
king
and
the
child
of
a
weaver
were
born
in
the
same
moment
what
was
that
disparity
to
the
death
of
any
human
creature
who
was
serviceable
to
or
beloved
by
another
while
this
abandoned
woman
lived
on
from
the
outside
of
his
home
he
gloomily
passed
to
the
inside
with
suspended
breath
and
with
a
slow
footstep
he
went
up
to
his
door
opened
it
and
so
into
the
room
quiet
and
peace
were
there
rachael
was
there
sitting
by
the
bed
she
turned
her
head
and
the
light
of
her
face
shone
in
upon
the
midnight
of
his
mind
she
sat
by
the
bed
watching
and
tending
his
wife
that
is
to
say
he
saw
that
some
one
lay
there
and
he
knew
too
well
it
must
be
she
but
rachael
s
hands
had
put
a
curtain
up
so
that
she
was
screened
from
his
eyes
her
disgraceful
garments
were
removed
and
some
of
rachael
s
were
in
the
room
everything
was
in
its
place
and
order
as
he
had
always
kept
it
the
little
fire
was
newly
trimmed
and
the
hearth
was
freshly
swept
it
appeared
to
him
that
he
saw
all
this
in
rachael
s
face
and
looked
at
nothing
besides
while
looking
at
it
it
was
shut
out
from
his
view
by
the
softened
tears
that
filled
his
eyes
but
not
before
he
had
seen
how
earnestly
she
looked
at
him
and
how
her
own
eyes
were
filled
too
she
turned
again
towards
the
bed
and
satisfying
herself
that
all
was
quiet
there
spoke
in
a
low
calm
cheerful
voice
i
am
glad
you
have
come
at
last
stephen
you
are
very
i
ha
been
walking
up
an
i
thought
so
but
tis
too
bad
a
night
for
that
the
rain
falls
very
heavy
and
the
wind
has
the
wind
true
it
was
blowing
hard
hark
to
the
thundering
in
the
chimney
and
the
surging
noise
to
have
been
out
in
such
a
wind
and
not
to
have
known
it
was
blowing
i
have
been
here
once
before
stephen
landlady
came
round
for
me
at
there
was
some
one
here
that
needed
looking
to
she
said
and
deed
she
was
right
all
wandering
and
lost
stephen
wounded
too
and
he
slowly
moved
to
a
chair
and
sat
down
drooping
his
head
before
her
i
came
to
do
what
little
i
could
stephen
first
for
that
she
worked
with
me
when
we
were
girls
both
and
for
that
you
courted
her
and
married
her
when
i
was
her
he
laid
his
furrowed
forehead
on
his
hand
with
a
low
groan
and
next
for
that
i
know
your
heart
and
am
right
sure
and
certain
that
tis
far
too
merciful
to
let
her
die
or
even
so
much
as
suffer
for
want
of
aid
thou
knowest
who
said
let
him
who
is
without
sin
among
you
cast
the
first
stone
at
her
there
have
been
plenty
to
do
that
thou
art
not
the
man
to
cast
the
last
stone
stephen
when
she
is
brought
so
o
rachael
rachael
thou
hast
been
a
cruel
sufferer
heaven
reward
thee
she
said
in
compassionate
accents
i
am
thy
poor
friend
with
all
my
heart
and
picture
stephen
and
rachael
in
the
sick
room
the
wounds
of
which
she
had
spoken
seemed
to
be
about
the
neck
of
the
outcast
she
dressed
them
now
still
without
showing
her
she
steeped
a
piece
of
linen
in
a
basin
into
which
she
poured
some
liquid
from
a
bottle
and
laid
it
with
a
gentle
hand
upon
the
sore
the
table
had
been
drawn
close
to
the
bedside
and
on
it
there
were
two
bottles
this
was
one
it
was
not
so
far
off
but
that
stephen
following
her
hands
with
his
eyes
could
read
what
was
printed
on
it
in
large
letters
he
turned
of
a
deadly
hue
and
a
sudden
horror
seemed
to
fall
upon
him
i
will
stay
here
stephen
said
rachael
quietly
resuming
her
seat
till
the
bells
go
three
tis
to
be
done
again
at
three
and
then
she
may
be
left
till
but
thy
rest
agen
s
work
my
i
slept
sound
last
night
i
can
wake
many
nights
when
i
am
put
to
it
tis
thou
who
art
in
need
of
white
and
tired
try
to
sleep
in
the
chair
there
while
i
watch
thou
hadst
no
sleep
last
night
i
can
well
believe
s
work
is
far
harder
for
thee
than
for
he
heard
the
thundering
and
surging
out
of
doors
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
his
late
angry
mood
were
going
about
trying
to
get
at
him
she
had
cast
it
out
she
would
keep
it
out
he
trusted
to
her
to
defend
him
from
himself
she
don
t
know
me
stephen
she
just
drowsily
mutters
and
stares
i
have
spoken
to
her
times
and
again
but
she
don
t
notice
tis
as
well
so
when
she
comes
to
her
right
mind
once
more
i
shall
have
done
what
i
can
and
she
never
the
how
long
rachael
is
t
looked
for
that
she
ll
be
so
doctor
said
she
would
haply
come
to
her
mind
his
eyes
fell
again
on
the
bottle
and
a
tremble
passed
over
him
causing
him
to
shiver
in
every
limb
she
thought
he
was
chilled
with
the
wet
no
he
said
it
was
not
that
he
had
had
a
a
fright
ay
ay
coming
in
when
i
were
walking
when
i
were
thinking
when
it
seized
him
again
and
he
stood
up
holding
by
the
as
he
pressed
his
dank
cold
hair
down
with
a
hand
that
shook
as
if
it
were
palsied
stephen
she
was
coming
to
him
but
he
stretched
out
his
arm
to
stop
her
no
don
t
please
don
t
let
me
see
thee
setten
by
the
bed
let
me
see
thee
a
so
good
and
so
forgiving
let
me
see
thee
as
i
see
thee
when
i
coom
in
i
can
never
see
thee
better
than
so
never
never
never
he
had
a
violent
fit
of
trembling
and
then
sunk
into
his
chair
after
a
time
he
controlled
himself
and
resting
with
an
elbow
on
one
knee
and
his
head
upon
that
hand
could
look
towards
rachael
seen
across
the
dim
candle
with
his
moistened
eyes
she
looked
as
if
she
had
a
glory
shining
round
her
head
he
could
have
believed
she
had
he
did
believe
it
as
the
noise
without
shook
the
window
rattled
at
the
door
below
and
went
about
the
house
clamouring
and
lamenting
when
she
gets
better
stephen
tis
to
be
hoped
she
ll
leave
thee
to
thyself
again
and
do
thee
no
more
hurt
anyways
we
will
hope
so
now
and
now
i
shall
keep
silence
for
i
want
thee
to
he
closed
his
eyes
more
to
please
her
than
to
rest
his
weary
head
but
by
slow
degrees
as
he
listened
to
the
great
noise
of
the
wind
he
ceased
to
hear
it
or
it
changed
into
the
working
of
his
loom
or
even
into
the
voices
of
the
day
his
own
included
saying
what
had
been
really
said
even
this
imperfect
consciousness
faded
away
at
last
and
he
dreamed
a
long
troubled
dream
he
thought
that
he
and
some
one
on
whom
his
heart
had
long
been
she
was
not
rachael
and
that
surprised
him
even
in
the
midst
of
his
imaginary
in
the
church
being
married
while
the
ceremony
was
performing
and
while
he
recognized
among
the
witnesses
some
whom
he
knew
to
be
living
and
many
whom
he
knew
to
be
dead
darkness
came
on
succeeded
by
the
shining
of
a
tremendous
light
it
broke
from
one
line
in
the
table
of
commandments
at
the
altar
and
illuminated
the
building
with
the
words
they
were
sounded
through
the
church
too
as
if
there
were
voices
in
the
fiery
letters
upon
this
the
whole
appearance
before
him
and
around
him
changed
and
nothing
was
left
as
it
had
been
but
himself
and
the
clergyman
they
stood
in
the
daylight
before
a
crowd
so
vast
that
if
all
the
people
in
the
world
could
have
been
brought
together
into
one
space
they
could
not
have
looked
he
thought
more
numerous
and
they
all
abhorred
him
and
there
was
not
one
pitying
or
friendly
eye
among
the
millions
that
were
fastened
on
his
face
he
stood
on
a
raised
stage
under
his
own
loom
and
looking
up
at
the
shape
the
loom
took
and
hearing
the
burial
service
distinctly
read
he
knew
that
he
was
there
to
suffer
death
in
an
instant
what
he
stood
on
fell
below
him
and
he
was
gone
of
what
mystery
he
came
back
to
his
usual
life
and
to
places
that
he
knew
he
was
unable
to
consider
but
he
was
back
in
those
places
by
some
means
and
with
this
condemnation
upon
him
that
he
was
never
in
this
world
or
the
next
through
all
the
unimaginable
ages
of
eternity
to
look
on
rachael
s
face
or
hear
her
voice
wandering
to
and
fro
unceasingly
without
hope
and
in
search
of
he
knew
not
what
he
only
knew
that
he
was
doomed
to
seek
it
he
was
the
subject
of
a
nameless
horrible
dread
a
mortal
fear
of
one
particular
shape
which
everything
took
whatsoever
he
looked
at
grew
into
that
form
sooner
or
later
the
object
of
his
miserable
existence
was
to
prevent
its
recognition
by
any
one
among
the
various
people
he
encountered
hopeless
labour
if
he
led
them
out
of
rooms
where
it
was
if
he
shut
up
drawers
and
closets
where
it
stood
if
he
drew
the
curious
from
places
where
he
knew
it
to
be
secreted
and
got
them
out
into
the
streets
the
very
chimneys
of
the
mills
assumed
that
shape
and
round
them
was
the
printed
word
the
wind
was
blowing
again
the
rain
was
beating
on
the
and
the
larger
spaces
through
which
he
had
strayed
contracted
to
the
four
walls
of
his
room
saving
that
the
fire
had
died
out
it
was
as
his
eyes
had
closed
upon
it
rachael
seemed
to
have
fallen
into
a
doze
in
the
chair
by
the
bed
she
sat
wrapped
in
her
shawl
perfectly
still
the
table
stood
in
the
same
place
close
by
the
bedside
and
on
it
in
its
real
proportions
and
appearance
was
the
shape
so
often
repeated
he
thought
he
saw
the
curtain
move
he
looked
again
and
he
was
sure
it
moved
he
saw
a
hand
come
forth
and
grope
about
a
little
then
the
curtain
moved
more
perceptibly
and
the
woman
in
the
bed
put
it
back
and
sat
up
with
her
woful
eyes
so
haggard
and
wild
so
heavy
and
large
she
looked
all
round
the
room
and
passed
the
corner
where
he
slept
in
his
chair
her
eyes
returned
to
that
corner
and
she
put
her
hand
over
them
as
a
shade
while
she
looked
into
it
again
they
went
all
round
the
room
scarcely
heeding
rachael
if
at
all
and
returned
to
that
corner
he
thought
as
she
once
more
shaded
so
much
looking
at
him
as
looking
for
him
with
a
brutish
instinct
that
he
was
no
single
trace
was
left
in
those
debauched
features
or
in
the
mind
that
went
along
with
them
of
the
woman
he
had
married
eighteen
years
before
but
that
he
had
seen
her
come
to
this
by
inches
he
never
could
have
believed
her
to
be
the
same
all
this
time
as
if
a
spell
were
on
him
he
was
motionless
and
powerless
except
to
watch
her
stupidly
dozing
or
communing
with
her
incapable
self
about
nothing
she
sat
for
a
little
while
with
her
hands
at
her
ears
and
her
head
resting
on
them
presently
she
resumed
her
staring
round
the
room
and
now
for
the
first
time
her
eyes
stopped
at
the
table
with
the
bottles
on
it
straightway
she
turned
her
eyes
back
to
his
corner
with
the
defiance
of
last
night
and
moving
very
cautiously
and
softly
stretched
out
her
greedy
hand
she
drew
a
mug
into
the
bed
and
sat
for
a
while
considering
which
of
the
two
bottles
she
should
choose
finally
she
laid
her
insensate
grasp
upon
the
bottle
that
had
swift
and
certain
death
in
it
and
before
his
eyes
pulled
out
the
cork
with
her
teeth
dream
or
reality
he
had
no
voice
nor
had
he
power
to
stir
if
this
be
real
and
her
allotted
time
be
not
yet
come
wake
rachael
wake
she
thought
of
that
too
she
looked
at
rachael
and
very
slowly
very
cautiously
poured
out
the
contents
the
draught
was
at
her
lips
a
moment
and
she
would
be
past
all
help
let
the
whole
world
wake
and
come
about
her
with
its
utmost
power
but
in
that
moment
rachael
started
up
with
a
suppressed
cry
the
creature
struggled
struck
her
seized
her
by
the
hair
but
rachael
had
the
cup
stephen
broke
out
of
his
chair
rachael
am
i
wakin
or
dreamin
this
dreadfo
night
tis
all
well
stephen
i
have
been
asleep
myself
tis
near
three
hush
i
hear
the
the
wind
brought
the
sounds
of
the
church
clock
to
the
window
they
listened
and
it
struck
three
stephen
looked
at
her
saw
how
pale
she
was
noted
the
disorder
of
her
hair
and
the
red
marks
of
fingers
on
her
forehead
and
felt
assured
that
his
senses
of
sight
and
hearing
had
been
awake
she
held
the
cup
in
her
hand
even
now
i
thought
it
must
be
near
three
she
said
calmly
pouring
from
the
cup
into
the
basin
and
steeping
the
linen
as
before
i
am
thankful
i
stayed
tis
done
now
when
i
have
put
this
on
there
and
now
she
s
quiet
again
the
few
drops
in
the
basin
i
ll
pour
away
for
tis
bad
stuff
to
leave
about
though
ever
so
little
of
as
she
spoke
she
drained
the
basin
into
the
ashes
of
the
fire
and
broke
the
bottle
on
the
hearth
she
had
nothing
to
do
then
but
to
cover
herself
with
her
shawl
before
going
out
into
the
wind
and
rain
thou
lt
let
me
walk
wi
thee
at
this
hour
rachael
no
stephen
tis
but
a
minute
and
i
m
thou
rt
not
fearfo
he
said
it
in
a
low
voice
as
they
went
out
at
the
door
to
leave
me
alone
wi
her
as
she
looked
at
him
saying
stephen
he
went
down
on
his
knee
before
her
on
the
poor
mean
stairs
and
put
an
end
of
her
shawl
to
his
lips
thou
art
an
angel
bless
thee
bless
thee
i
am
as
i
have
told
thee
stephen
thy
poor
friend
angels
are
not
like
me
between
them
and
a
working
woman
fu
of
faults
there
is
a
deep
gulf
set
my
little
sister
is
among
them
but
she
is
she
raised
her
eyes
for
a
moment
as
she
said
the
words
and
then
they
fell
again
in
all
their
gentleness
and
mildness
on
his
face
thou
changest
me
from
bad
to
good
thou
mak
st
me
humbly
wishfo
to
be
more
like
thee
and
fearfo
to
lose
thee
when
this
life
is
ower
and
a
the
muddle
cleared
awa
thou
rt
an
angel
it
may
be
thou
hast
saved
my
soul
alive
she
looked
at
him
on
his
knee
at
her
feet
with
her
shawl
still
in
his
hand
and
the
reproof
on
her
lips
died
away
when
she
saw
the
working
of
his
face
i
coom
home
desp
rate
i
coom
home
wi
out
a
hope
and
mad
wi
thinking
that
when
i
said
a
word
o
complaint
i
was
reckoned
a
unreasonable
hand
i
told
thee
i
had
had
a
fright
it
were
the
on
table
i
never
hurt
a
livin
creetur
but
happenin
so
suddenly
upon
t
i
thowt
how
can
say
what
i
might
ha
done
to
myseln
or
her
or
both
she
put
her
two
hands
on
his
mouth
with
a
face
of
terror
to
stop
him
from
saying
more
he
caught
them
in
his
unoccupied
hand
and
holding
them
and
still
clasping
the
border
of
her
shawl
said
hurriedly
but
i
see
thee
rachael
setten
by
the
bed
i
ha
seen
thee
aw
this
night
in
my
troublous
sleep
i
ha
known
thee
still
to
be
there
evermore
i
will
see
thee
there
i
nevermore
will
see
her
or
think
o
her
but
thou
shalt
be
beside
her
i
nevermore
will
see
or
think
o
anything
that
angers
me
but
thou
so
much
better
than
me
shalt
be
by
th
side
on
t
and
so
i
will
try
t
look
t
th
time
and
so
i
will
try
t
trust
t
th
time
when
thou
and
me
at
last
shall
walk
together
far
awa
beyond
the
deep
gulf
in
th
country
where
thy
little
sister
he
kissed
the
border
of
her
shawl
again
and
let
her
go
she
bade
him
good
night
in
a
broken
voice
and
went
out
into
the
street
the
wind
blew
from
the
quarter
where
the
day
would
soon
appear
and
still
blew
strongly
it
had
cleared
the
sky
before
it
and
the
rain
had
spent
itself
or
travelled
elsewhere
and
the
stars
were
bright
he
stood
in
the
road
watching
her
quick
disappearance
as
the
shining
stars
were
to
the
heavy
candle
in
the
window
so
was
rachael
in
the
rugged
fancy
of
this
man
to
the
common
experiences
of
his
life
chapter
xiv
the
great
manufacturer
time
went
on
in
coketown
like
its
own
machinery
so
much
material
wrought
up
so
much
fuel
consumed
so
many
powers
worn
out
so
much
money
made
but
less
inexorable
than
iron
steel
and
brass
it
brought
its
varying
seasons
even
into
that
wilderness
of
smoke
and
brick
and
made
the
only
stand
that
ever
made
in
the
place
against
its
direful
uniformity
louisa
is
becoming
said
gradgrind
almost
a
young
time
with
his
innumerable
worked
away
not
minding
what
anybody
said
and
presently
turned
out
young
thomas
a
foot
taller
than
when
his
father
had
last
taken
particular
notice
of
him
thomas
is
becoming
said
gradgrind
almost
a
young
time
passed
thomas
on
in
the
mill
while
his
father
was
thinking
about
it
and
there
he
stood
in
a
coat
and
a
stiff
really
said
gradgrind
the
period
has
arrived
when
thomas
ought
to
go
to
time
sticking
to
him
passed
him
on
into
bounderby
s
bank
made
him
an
inmate
of
bounderby
s
house
necessitated
the
purchase
of
his
first
razor
and
exercised
him
diligently
in
his
calculations
relative
to
number
one
the
same
great
manufacturer
always
with
an
immense
variety
of
work
on
hand
in
every
stage
of
development
passed
sissy
onward
in
his
mill
and
worked
her
up
into
a
very
pretty
article
indeed
i
fear
jupe
said
gradgrind
that
your
continuance
at
the
school
any
longer
would
be
i
am
afraid
it
would
sir
sissy
answered
with
a
curtsey
i
can
not
disguise
from
you
jupe
said
gradgrind
knitting
his
brow
that
the
result
of
your
probation
there
has
disappointed
me
has
greatly
disappointed
me
you
have
not
acquired
under
and
m
choakumchild
anything
like
that
amount
of
exact
knowledge
which
i
looked
for
you
are
extremely
deficient
in
your
facts
your
acquaintance
with
figures
is
very
limited
you
are
altogether
backward
and
below
the
i
am
sorry
sir
she
returned
but
i
know
it
is
quite
true
yet
i
have
tried
hard
yes
said
gradgrind
yes
i
believe
you
have
tried
hard
i
have
observed
you
and
i
can
find
no
fault
in
that
thank
you
sir
i
have
thought
sometimes
sissy
very
timid
here
that
perhaps
i
tried
to
learn
too
much
and
that
if
i
had
asked
to
be
allowed
to
try
a
little
less
i
might
no
jupe
no
said
gradgrind
shaking
his
head
in
his
profoundest
and
most
eminently
practical
way
no
the
course
you
pursued
you
pursued
according
to
the
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
about
it
i
can
only
suppose
that
the
circumstances
of
your
early
life
were
too
unfavourable
to
the
development
of
your
reasoning
powers
and
that
we
began
too
late
still
as
i
have
said
already
i
am
i
wish
i
could
have
made
a
better
acknowledgment
sir
of
your
kindness
to
a
poor
forlorn
girl
who
had
no
claim
upon
you
and
of
your
protection
of
don
t
shed
tears
said
gradgrind
don
t
shed
tears
i
don
t
complain
of
you
you
are
an
affectionate
earnest
good
young
we
must
make
that
thank
you
sir
very
much
said
sissy
with
a
grateful
curtsey
you
are
useful
to
gradgrind
and
in
a
generally
pervading
way
you
are
serviceable
in
the
family
also
so
i
understand
from
miss
louisa
and
indeed
so
i
have
observed
myself
i
therefore
hope
said
gradgrind
that
you
can
make
yourself
happy
in
those
i
should
have
nothing
to
wish
sir
i
understand
you
said
gradgrind
you
still
refer
to
your
father
i
have
heard
from
miss
louisa
that
you
still
preserve
that
bottle
well
if
your
training
in
the
science
of
arriving
at
exact
results
had
been
more
successful
you
would
have
been
wiser
on
these
points
i
will
say
no
he
really
liked
sissy
too
well
to
have
a
contempt
for
her
otherwise
he
held
her
calculating
powers
in
such
very
slight
estimation
that
he
must
have
fallen
upon
that
conclusion
somehow
or
other
he
had
become
possessed
by
an
idea
that
there
was
something
in
this
girl
which
could
hardly
be
set
forth
in
a
tabular
form
her
capacity
of
definition
might
be
easily
stated
at
a
very
low
figure
her
mathematical
knowledge
at
nothing
yet
he
was
not
sure
that
if
he
had
been
required
for
example
to
tick
her
off
into
columns
in
a
parliamentary
return
he
would
have
quite
known
how
to
divide
her
in
some
stages
of
his
manufacture
of
the
human
fabric
the
processes
of
time
are
very
rapid
young
thomas
and
sissy
being
both
at
such
a
stage
of
their
working
up
these
changes
were
effected
in
a
year
or
two
while
gradgrind
himself
seemed
stationary
in
his
course
and
underwent
no
alteration
except
one
which
was
apart
from
his
necessary
progress
through
the
mill
time
hustled
him
into
a
little
noisy
and
rather
dirty
machinery
in
a
and
made
him
member
of
parliament
for
coketown
one
of
the
respected
members
for
ounce
weights
and
measures
one
of
the
representatives
of
the
multiplication
table
one
of
the

lame

to
every
other
consideration
else
wherefore
live
we
in
a
christian
land
eighteen
hundred
and
odd
years
after
our
master
all
this
while
louisa
had
been
passing
on
so
quiet
and
reserved
and
so
much
given
to
watching
the
bright
ashes
at
twilight
as
they
fell
into
the
grate
and
became
extinct
that
from
the
period
when
her
father
had
said
she
was
almost
a
young
seemed
but
had
scarcely
attracted
his
notice
again
when
he
found
her
quite
a
young
woman
quite
a
young
woman
said
gradgrind
musing
dear
me
soon
after
this
discovery
he
became
more
thoughtful
than
usual
for
several
days
and
seemed
much
engrossed
by
one
subject
on
a
certain
night
when
he
was
going
out
and
louisa
came
to
bid
him
before
his
he
was
not
to
be
home
until
late
and
she
would
not
see
him
again
until
the
held
her
in
his
arms
looking
at
her
in
his
kindest
manner
and
said
my
dear
louisa
you
are
a
woman
she
answered
with
the
old
quick
searching
look
of
the
night
when
she
was
found
at
the
circus
then
cast
down
her
eyes
yes
my
dear
said
gradgrind
i
must
speak
with
you
alone
and
seriously
come
to
me
in
my
room
after
breakfast
will
you
yes
your
hands
are
rather
cold
louisa
are
you
not
well
quite
well
and
cheerful
she
looked
at
him
again
and
smiled
in
her
peculiar
manner
i
am
as
cheerful
father
as
i
usually
am
or
usually
have
that
s
well
said
gradgrind
so
he
kissed
her
and
went
away
and
louisa
returned
to
the
serene
apartment
of
the
character
and
leaning
her
elbow
on
her
hand
looked
again
at
the
sparks
that
so
soon
subsided
into
ashes
are
you
there
loo
said
her
brother
looking
in
at
the
door
he
was
quite
a
young
gentleman
of
pleasure
now
and
not
quite
a
prepossessing
one
dear
tom
she
answered
rising
and
embracing
him
how
long
it
is
since
you
have
been
to
see
me
why
i
have
been
otherwise
engaged
loo
in
the
evenings
and
in
the
daytime
old
bounderby
has
been
keeping
me
at
it
rather
but
i
touch
him
up
with
you
when
he
comes
it
too
strong
and
so
we
preserve
an
understanding
i
say
has
father
said
anything
particular
to
you
or
yesterday
loo
no
tom
but
he
told
me
that
he
wished
to
do
so
in
the
ah
that
s
what
i
mean
said
tom
do
you
know
where
he
is
a
very
deep
expression
then
i
ll
tell
you
he
s
with
old
bounderby
they
are
having
a
regular
confab
together
up
at
the
bank
why
at
the
bank
do
you
think
well
i
ll
tell
you
again
to
keep
sparsit
s
ears
as
far
off
as
possible
i
with
her
hand
upon
her
brother
s
shoulder
louisa
still
stood
looking
at
the
fire
her
brother
glanced
at
her
face
with
greater
interest
than
usual
and
encircling
her
waist
with
his
arm
drew
her
coaxingly
to
him
you
are
very
fond
of
me
an
t
you
loo
indeed
i
am
tom
though
you
do
let
such
long
intervals
go
by
without
coming
to
see
well
sister
of
mine
said
tom
when
you
say
that
you
are
near
my
thoughts
we
might
be
so
much
oftener
t
we
always
together
t
we
it
would
do
me
a
great
deal
of
good
if
you
were
to
make
up
your
mind
to
i
know
what
loo
it
would
be
a
splendid
thing
for
me
it
would
be
uncommonly
jolly
her
thoughtfulness
baffled
his
cunning
scrutiny
he
could
make
nothing
of
her
face
he
pressed
her
in
his
arm
and
kissed
her
cheek
she
returned
the
kiss
but
still
looked
at
the
fire
i
say
loo
i
thought
i
d
come
and
just
hint
to
you
what
was
going
on
though
i
supposed
you
d
most
likely
guess
even
if
you
didn
t
know
i
can
t
stay
because
i
m
engaged
to
some
fellows
you
won
t
forget
how
fond
you
are
of
me
no
dear
tom
i
won
t
that
s
a
capital
girl
said
tom
she
gave
him
an
affectionate
and
went
out
with
him
to
the
door
whence
the
fires
of
coketown
could
be
seen
making
the
distance
lurid
she
stood
there
looking
steadfastly
towards
them
and
listening
to
his
departing
steps
they
retreated
quickly
as
glad
to
get
away
from
stone
lodge
and
she
stood
there
yet
when
he
was
gone
and
all
was
quiet
it
seemed
as
if
first
in
her
own
fire
within
the
house
and
then
in
the
fiery
haze
without
she
tried
to
discover
what
kind
of
woof
old
time
that
greatest
and
spinner
of
all
would
weave
from
the
threads
he
had
already
spun
into

woman

factory
is
a
secret
place
his
work
is
noiseless

hands
are

father
and
daughter
although
gradgrind
did
not
take
after
blue
beard
his
room
was
quite
a
blue
chamber
in
its
abundance
of
blue
books
whatever
they
could
prove
which
is
usually
anything
you
like
they
proved
there
in
an
army
constantly
strengthening
by
the
arrival
of
new
recruits
in
that
charmed
apartment
the
most
complicated
social
questions
were
cast
up
got
into
exact
totals
and
finally
those
concerned
could
only
have
been
brought
to
know
it
as
if
an
astronomical
observatory
should
be
made
without
any
windows
and
the
astronomer
within
should
arrange
the
starry
universe
solely
by
pen
ink
and
paper
so
gradgrind
in
observatory
and
there
are
many
like
it
had
no
need
to
cast
an
eye
upon
the
teeming
myriads
of
human
beings
around
him
but
could
settle
all
their
destinies
on
a
slate
and
wipe
out
all
their
tears
with
one
dirty
little
bit
of
sponge
to
this
observatory
then
a
stern
room
with
a
deadly
statistical
clock
in
it
which
measured
every
second
with
a
beat
like
a
rap
upon
a
louisa
repaired
on
the
appointed
morning
a
window
looked
towards
coketown
and
when
she
sat
down
near
her
father
s
table
she
saw
the
high
chimneys
and
the
long
tracts
of
smoke
looming
in
the
heavy
distance
gloomily
my
dear
louisa
said
her
father
i
prepared
you
last
night
to
give
me
your
serious
attention
in
the
conversation
we
are
now
going
to
have
together
you
have
been
so
well
trained
and
you
do
i
am
happy
to
say
so
much
justice
to
the
education
you
have
received
that
i
have
perfect
confidence
in
your
good
sense
you
are
not
impulsive
you
are
not
romantic
you
are
accustomed
to
view
everything
from
the
strong
dispassionate
ground
of
reason
and
calculation
from
that
ground
alone
i
know
you
will
view
and
consider
what
i
am
going
to
he
waited
as
if
he
would
have
been
glad
that
she
said
something
but
she
said
never
a
word
louisa
my
dear
you
are
the
subject
of
a
proposal
of
marriage
that
has
been
made
to
again
he
waited
and
again
she
answered
not
one
word
this
so
far
surprised
him
as
to
induce
him
gently
to
repeat
a
proposal
of
marriage
my
to
which
she
returned
without
any
visible
emotion
whatever
i
hear
you
father
i
am
attending
i
assure
well
said
gradgrind
breaking
into
a
smile
after
being
for
the
moment
at
a
loss
you
are
even
more
dispassionate
than
i
expected
louisa
or
perhaps
you
are
not
unprepared
for
the
announcement
i
have
it
in
charge
to
make
i
can
not
say
that
father
until
i
hear
it
prepared
or
unprepared
i
wish
to
hear
it
all
from
you
i
wish
to
hear
you
state
it
to
me
strange
to
relate
gradgrind
was
not
so
collected
at
this
moment
as
his
daughter
was
he
took
a
in
his
hand
turned
it
over
laid
it
down
took
it
up
again
and
even
then
had
to
look
along
the
blade
of
it
considering
how
to
go
on
what
you
say
my
dear
louisa
is
perfectly
reasonable
i
have
undertaken
then
to
let
you
know
short
that
bounderby
has
informed
me
that
he
has
long
watched
your
progress
with
particular
interest
and
pleasure
and
has
long
hoped
that
the
time
might
ultimately
arrive
when
he
should
offer
you
his
hand
in
marriage
that
time
to
which
he
has
so
long
and
certainly
with
great
constancy
looked
forward
is
now
come
bounderby
has
made
his
proposal
of
marriage
to
me
and
has
entreated
me
to
make
it
known
to
you
and
to
express
his
hope
that
you
will
take
it
into
your
favourable
silence
between
them
the
deadly
statistical
clock
very
hollow
the
distant
smoke
very
black
and
heavy
father
said
louisa
do
you
think
i
love
bounderby
gradgrind
was
extremely
discomfited
by
this
unexpected
question
well
my
child
he
returned
can
not
take
upon
myself
to
father
pursued
louisa
in
exactly
the
same
voice
as
before
do
you
ask
me
to
love
bounderby
my
dear
louisa
no
no
i
ask
father
she
still
pursued
does
bounderby
ask
me
to
love
him
really
my
dear
said
gradgrind
it
is
difficult
to
answer
your
difficult
to
answer
it
yes
or
no
father
certainly
my
dear
because
here
was
something
to
demonstrate
and
it
set
him
up
again
because
the
reply
depends
so
materially
louisa
on
the
sense
in
which
we
use
the
expression
now
bounderby
does
not
do
you
the
injustice
and
does
not
do
himself
the
injustice
of
pretending
to
anything
fanciful
fantastic
or
i
am
using
synonymous
terms
sentimental
bounderby
would
have
seen
you
grow
up
under
his
eyes
to
very
little
purpose
if
he
could
so
far
forget
what
is
due
to
your
good
sense
not
to
say
to
his
as
to
address
you
from
any
such
ground
therefore
perhaps
the
expression
merely
suggest
this
to
you
my
be
a
little
what
would
you
advise
me
to
use
in
its
stead
father
why
my
dear
louisa
said
gradgrind
completely
recovered
by
this
time
i
would
advise
you
since
you
ask
me
to
consider
this
question
as
you
have
been
accustomed
to
consider
every
other
question
simply
as
one
of
tangible
fact
the
ignorant
and
the
giddy
may
embarrass
such
subjects
with
irrelevant
fancies
and
other
absurdities
that
have
no
existence
properly
no
it
is
no
compliment
to
you
to
say
that
you
know
better
now
what
are
the
facts
of
this
case
you
are
we
will
say
in
round
numbers
twenty
years
of
age
bounderby
is
we
will
say
in
round
numbers
fifty
there
is
some
disparity
in
your
respective
years
but
in
your
means
and
positions
there
is
none
on
the
contrary
there
is
a
great
suitability
then
the
question
arises
is
this
one
disparity
sufficient
to
operate
as
a
bar
to
such
a
marriage
in
considering
this
question
it
is
not
unimportant
to
take
into
account
the
statistics
of
marriage
so
far
as
they
have
yet
been
obtained
in
england
and
wales
i
find
on
reference
to
the
figures
that
a
large
proportion
of
these
marriages
are
contracted
between
parties
of
very
unequal
ages
and
that
the
elder
of
these
contracting
parties
is
in
rather
more
than
of
these
instances
the
bridegroom
it
is
remarkable
as
showing
the
wide
prevalence
of
this
law
that
among
the
natives
of
the
british
possessions
in
india
also
in
a
considerable
part
of
china
and
among
the
calmucks
of
tartary
the
best
means
of
computation
yet
furnished
us
by
travellers
yield
similar
results
the
disparity
i
have
mentioned
therefore
almost
ceases
to
be
disparity
and
virtually
all
but
what
do
you
recommend
father
asked
louisa
her
reserved
composure
not
in
the
least
affected
by
these
gratifying
results
that
i
should
substitute
for
the
term
i
used
just
now
for
the
misplaced
expression
louisa
returned
her
father
it
appears
to
me
that
nothing
can
be
plainer
confining
yourself
rigidly
to
fact
the
question
of
fact
you
state
to
yourself
is
does
bounderby
ask
me
to
marry
him
yes
he
does
the
sole
remaining
question
then
is
shall
i
marry
him
i
think
nothing
can
be
plainer
than
that
shall
i
marry
him
repeated
louisa
with
great
deliberation
precisely
and
it
is
satisfactory
to
me
as
your
father
my
dear
louisa
to
know
that
you
do
not
come
to
the
consideration
of
that
question
with
the
previous
habits
of
mind
and
habits
of
life
that
belong
to
many
young
no
father
she
returned
i
do
i
now
leave
you
to
judge
for
yourself
said
gradgrind
i
have
stated
the
case
as
such
cases
are
usually
stated
among
practical
minds
i
have
stated
it
as
the
case
of
your
mother
and
myself
was
stated
in
its
time
the
rest
my
dear
louisa
is
for
you
to
from
the
beginning
she
had
sat
looking
at
him
fixedly
as
he
now
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
bent
his
eyes
upon
her
in
his
turn
perhaps
he
might
have
seen
one
wavering
moment
in
her
when
she
was
impelled
to
throw
herself
upon
his
breast
and
give
him
the
confidences
of
her
heart
but
to
see
it
he
must
have
overleaped
at
a
bound
the
artificial
barriers
he
had
for
many
years
been
erecting
between
himself
and
all
those
subtle
essences
of
humanity
which
will
elude
the
utmost
cunning
of
algebra
until
the
last
trumpet
ever
to
be
sounded
shall
blow
even
algebra
to
wreck
the
barriers
were
too
many
and
too
high
for
such
a
leap
with
his
unbending
utilitarian
face
he
hardened
her
again
and
the
moment
shot
away
into
the
plumbless
depths
of
the
past
to
mingle
with
all
the
lost
opportunities
that
are
drowned
there
removing
her
eyes
from
him
she
sat
so
long
looking
silently
towards
the
town
that
he
said
at
length
are
you
consulting
the
chimneys
of
the
coketown
works
louisa
there
seems
to
be
nothing
there
but
languid
and
monotonous
smoke
yet
when
the
night
comes
fire
bursts
out
father
she
answered
turning
quickly
of
course
i
know
that
louisa
i
do
not
see
the
application
of
the
to
do
him
justice
he
did
not
at
all
she
passed
it
away
with
a
slight
motion
of
her
hand
and
concentrating
her
attention
upon
him
again
said
father
i
have
often
thought
that
life
is
very
was
so
distinctly
one
of
his
subjects
that
he
interposed
it
is
short
no
doubt
my
dear
still
the
average
duration
of
human
life
is
proved
to
have
increased
of
late
years
the
calculations
of
various
life
assurance
and
annuity
offices
among
other
figures
which
can
not
go
wrong
have
established
the
i
speak
of
my
own
life
o
indeed
still
said
gradgrind
i
need
not
point
out
to
you
louisa
that
it
is
governed
by
the
laws
which
govern
lives
in
the
while
it
lasts
i
would
wish
to
do
the
little
i
can
and
the
little
i
am
fit
for
what
does
it
matter
gradgrind
seemed
rather
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
last
four
words
replying
how
matter
what
matter
my
dear
mr
bounderby
she
went
on
in
a
steady
straight
way
without
regarding
this
asks
me
to
marry
him
the
question
i
have
to
ask
myself
is
shall
i
marry
him
that
is
so
father
is
it
not
you
have
told
me
so
father
have
you
not
certainly
my
let
it
be
so
since
bounderby
likes
to
take
me
thus
i
am
satisfied
to
accept
his
proposal
tell
him
father
as
soon
as
you
please
that
this
was
my
answer
repeat
it
word
for
word
if
you
can
because
i
should
wish
him
to
know
what
i
it
is
quite
right
my
dear
retorted
her
father
approvingly
to
be
exact
i
will
observe
your
very
proper
request
have
you
any
wish
in
reference
to
the
period
of
your
marriage
my
child
none
father
what
does
it
matter
gradgrind
had
drawn
his
chair
a
little
nearer
to
her
and
taken
her
hand
but
her
repetition
of
these
words
seemed
to
strike
with
some
little
discord
on
his
ear
he
paused
to
look
at
her
and
still
holding
her
hand
said
louisa
i
have
not
considered
it
essential
to
ask
you
one
question
because
the
possibility
implied
in
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
too
remote
but
perhaps
i
ought
to
do
so
you
have
never
entertained
in
secret
any
other
proposal
father
she
returned
almost
scornfully
what
other
proposal
can
have
been
made
to
whom
have
i
seen
where
have
i
been
what
are
my
heart
s
experiences
my
dear
louisa
returned
gradgrind
reassured
and
satisfied
you
correct
me
justly
i
merely
wished
to
discharge
my
what
do
know
father
said
louisa
in
her
quiet
manner
of
tastes
and
fancies
of
aspirations
and
affections
of
all
that
part
of
my
nature
in
which
such
light
things
might
have
been
nourished
what
escape
have
i
had
from
problems
that
could
be
demonstrated
and
realities
that
could
be
grasped
as
she
said
it
she
unconsciously
closed
her
hand
as
if
upon
a
solid
object
and
slowly
opened
it
as
though
she
were
releasing
dust
or
ash
my
dear
assented
her
eminently
practical
parent
quite
true
quite
why
father
she
pursued
what
a
strange
question
to
ask
the
that
even
i
have
heard
of
as
common
among
children
has
never
had
its
innocent
in
my
breast
you
have
been
so
careful
of
me
that
i
never
had
a
child
s
heart
you
have
trained
me
so
well
that
i
never
dreamed
a
child
s
dream
you
have
dealt
so
wisely
with
me
father
from
my
cradle
to
this
hour
that
i
never
had
a
child
s
belief
or
a
child
s
gradgrind
was
quite
moved
by
his
success
and
by
this
testimony
to
it
my
dear
louisa
said
he
you
abundantly
repay
my
care
kiss
me
my
dear
so
his
daughter
kissed
him
detaining
her
in
his
embrace
he
said
i
may
assure
you
now
my
favourite
child
that
i
am
made
happy
by
the
sound
decision
at
which
you
have
arrived
bounderby
is
a
very
remarkable
man
and
what
little
disparity
can
be
said
to
exist
between
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
tone
your
mind
has
acquired
it
has
always
been
my
object
so
to
educate
you
as
that
you
might
while
still
in
your
early
youth
be
if
i
may
so
express
myself
almost
any
age
kiss
me
once
more
louisa
now
let
us
go
and
find
your
accordingly
they
went
down
to
the
where
the
esteemed
lady
with
no
nonsense
about
her
was
recumbent
as
usual
while
sissy
worked
beside
her
she
gave
some
feeble
signs
of
returning
animation
when
they
entered
and
presently
the
faint
transparency
was
presented
in
a
sitting
attitude
mrs
gradgrind
said
her
husband
who
had
waited
for
the
achievement
of
this
feat
with
some
impatience
allow
me
to
present
to
you
oh
said
gradgrind
so
you
have
settled
it
well
i
m
sure
i
hope
your
health
may
be
good
louisa
for
if
your
head
begins
to
split
as
soon
as
you
are
married
which
was
the
case
with
mine
i
can
not
consider
that
you
are
to
be
envied
though
i
have
no
doubt
you
think
you
are
as
all
girls
do
however
i
give
you
joy
my
i
hope
you
may
now
turn
all
your
ological
studies
to
good
account
i
am
sure
i
do
i
must
give
you
a
kiss
of
congratulation
louisa
but
don
t
touch
my
right
shoulder
for
there
s
something
running
down
it
all
day
long
and
now
you
see
whimpered
gradgrind
adjusting
her
shawls
after
the
affectionate
ceremony
i
shall
be
worrying
myself
morning
noon
and
night
to
know
what
i
am
to
call
him
mrs
gradgrind
said
her
husband
solemnly
what
do
you
mean
whatever
i
am
to
call
him
gradgrind
when
he
is
married
to
louisa
i
must
call
him
something
it
s
impossible
said
gradgrind
with
a
mingled
sense
of
politeness
and
injury
to
be
constantly
addressing
him
and
never
giving
him
a
name
i
can
not
call
him
josiah
for
the
name
is
insupportable
to
me
you
yourself
wouldn
t
hear
of
joe
you
very
well
know
am
i
to
call
my
own
mister
not
i
believe
unless
the
time
has
arrived
when
as
an
invalid
i
am
to
be
trampled
upon
by
my
relations
then
what
am
i
to
call
him
nobody
present
having
any
suggestion
to
offer
in
the
remarkable
emergency
gradgrind
departed
this
life
for
the
time
being
after
delivering
the
following
codicil
to
her
remarks
already
executed
as
to
the
wedding
all
i
ask
louisa
is
i
ask
it
with
a
fluttering
in
my
chest
which
actually
extends
to
the
soles
of
my
feet
it
may
take
place
soon
otherwise
i
know
it
is
one
of
those
subjects
i
shall
never
hear
the
last
when
gradgrind
had
presented
bounderby
sissy
had
suddenly
turned
her
head
and
looked
in
wonder
in
pity
in
sorrow
in
doubt
in
a
multitude
of
emotions
towards
louisa
louisa
had
known
it
and
seen
it
without
looking
at
her
from
that
moment
she
was
impassive
proud
and
sissy

husband
and
wife
bounderby
s
first
disquietude
on
hearing
of
his
happiness
was
occasioned
by
the
necessity
of
imparting
it
to
sparsit
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
how
to
do
that
or
what
the
consequences
of
the
step
might
be
whether
she
would
instantly
depart
bag
and
baggage
to
lady
scadgers
or
would
positively
refuse
to
budge
from
the
premises
whether
she
would
be
plaintive
or
abusive
tearful
or
tearing
whether
she
would
break
her
heart
or
break
the
bounderby
could
not
all
foresee
however
as
it
must
be
done
he
had
no
choice
but
to
do
it
so
after
attempting
several
letters
and
failing
in
them
all
he
resolved
to
do
it
by
word
of
mouth
on
his
way
home
on
the
evening
he
set
aside
for
this
momentous
purpose
he
took
the
precaution
of
stepping
into
a
chemist
s
shop
and
buying
a
bottle
of
the
very
strongest

said
bounderby
if
she
takes
it
in
the
fainting
way
i
ll
have
the
skin
off
her
nose
at
all
events
but
in
spite
of
being
thus
forearmed
he
entered
his
own
house
with
anything
but
a
courageous
air
and
appeared
before
the
object
of
his
misgivings
like
a
dog
who
was
conscious
of
coming
direct
from
the
pantry
good
evening
bounderby
good
evening
ma
am
good
he
drew
up
his
chair
and
sparsit
drew
back
hers
as
who
should
say
your
fireside
sir
i
freely
admit
it
it
is
for
you
to
occupy
it
all
if
you
think
don
t
go
to
the
north
pole
ma
am
said
bounderby
thank
you
sir
said
sparsit
and
returned
though
short
of
her
former
position
bounderby
sat
looking
at
her
as
with
the
points
of
a
stiff
sharp
pair
of
scissors
she
picked
out
holes
for
some
inscrutable
ornamental
purpose
in
a
piece
of
cambric
an
operation
which
taken
in
connexion
with
the
bushy
eyebrows
and
the
roman
nose
suggested
with
some
liveliness
the
idea
of
a
hawk
engaged
upon
the
eyes
of
a
tough
little
bird
she
was
so
steadfastly
occupied
that
many
minutes
elapsed
before
she
looked
up
from
her
work
when
she
did
so
bounderby
bespoke
her
attention
with
a
hitch
of
his
head
mrs
sparsit
ma
am
said
bounderby
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
assuring
himself
with
his
right
hand
that
the
cork
of
the
little
bottle
was
ready
for
use
i
have
no
occasion
to
say
to
you
that
you
are
not
only
a
lady
born
and
bred
but
a
devilish
sensible
sir
returned
the
lady
this
is
indeed
not
the
first
time
that
you
have
honoured
me
with
similar
expressions
of
your
good
mrs
sparsit
ma
am
said
bounderby
i
am
going
to
astonish
yes
sir
returned
sparsit
interrogatively
and
in
the
most
tranquil
manner
possible
she
generally
wore
mittens
and
she
now
laid
down
her
work
and
smoothed
those
mittens
i
am
going
ma
am
said
bounderby
to
marry
tom
gradgrind
s
yes
sir
returned
sparsit
i
hope
you
may
be
happy
bounderby
oh
indeed
i
hope
you
may
be
happy
sir
and
she
said
it
with
such
great
condescension
as
well
as
with
such
great
compassion
for
him
that
bounderby
more
disconcerted
than
if
she
had
thrown
her
workbox
at
the
mirror
or
swooned
on
the
hearthrug
up
the
tight
in
his
pocket
and
thought
now
confound
this
woman
who
could
have
even
guessed
that
she
would
take
it
in
this
way
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
sir
said
sparsit
in
a
highly
superior
manner
somehow
she
seemed
in
a
moment
to
have
established
a
right
to
pity
him
ever
afterwards
that
you
may
be
in
all
respects
very
well
ma
am
returned
bounderby
with
some
resentment
in
his
tone
which
was
clearly
lowered
though
in
spite
of
himself
i
am
obliged
to
you
i
hope
i
shall
you
sir
said
sparsit
with
great
affability
but
naturally
you
do
of
course
you
a
very
awkward
pause
on
bounderby
s
part
succeeded
sparsit
sedately
resumed
her
work
and
occasionally
gave
a
small
cough
which
sounded
like
the
cough
of
conscious
strength
and
forbearance
well
ma
am
resumed
bounderby
under
these
circumstances
i
imagine
it
would
not
be
agreeable
to
a
character
like
yours
to
remain
here
though
you
would
be
very
welcome
oh
dear
no
sir
i
could
on
no
account
think
of
that
sparsit
shook
her
head
still
in
her
highly
superior
manner
and
a
little
changed
the
small
now
as
if
the
spirit
of
prophecy
rose
within
her
but
had
better
be
coughed
down
however
ma
am
said
bounderby
there
are
apartments
at
the
bank
where
a
born
and
bred
lady
as
keeper
of
the
place
would
be
rather
a
catch
than
otherwise
and
if
the
same
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
you
were
so
good
as
to
promise
that
you
would
always
substitute
the
phrase
annual
well
ma
am
annual
compliment
if
the
same
annual
compliment
would
be
acceptable
there
why
i
see
nothing
to
part
us
unless
you
sir
returned
sparsit
the
proposal
is
like
yourself
and
if
the
position
i
shall
assume
at
the
bank
is
one
that
i
could
occupy
without
descending
lower
in
the
social
why
of
course
it
is
said
bounderby
if
it
was
not
ma
am
you
don
t
suppose
that
i
should
offer
it
to
a
lady
who
has
moved
in
the
society
you
have
moved
in
not
that
care
for
such
society
you
know
but
mr
bounderby
you
are
very
you
ll
have
your
own
private
apartments
and
you
ll
have
your
coals
and
your
candles
and
all
the
rest
of
it
and
you
ll
have
your
maid
to
attend
upon
you
and
you
ll
have
your
light
porter
to
protect
you
and
you
ll
be
what
i
take
the
liberty
of
considering
precious
comfortable
said
bounderby
sir
rejoined
sparsit
say
no
more
in
yielding
up
my
trust
here
i
shall
not
be
freed
from
the
necessity
of
eating
the
bread
of
dependence
she
might
have
said
the
sweetbread
for
that
delicate
article
in
a
savoury
brown
sauce
was
her
favourite
supper
and
i
would
rather
receive
it
from
your
hand
than
from
any
other
therefore
sir
i
accept
your
offer
gratefully
and
with
many
sincere
acknowledgments
for
past
favours
and
i
hope
sir
said
sparsit
concluding
in
an
impressively
compassionate
manner
i
fondly
hope
that
miss
gradgrind
may
be
all
you
desire
and
deserve
nothing
moved
sparsit
from
that
position
any
more
it
was
in
vain
for
bounderby
to
bluster
or
to
assert
himself
in
any
of
his
explosive
ways
sparsit
was
resolved
to
have
compassion
on
him
as
a
victim
she
was
polite
obliging
cheerful
hopeful
but
the
more
polite
the
more
obliging
the
more
cheerful
the
more
hopeful
the
more
exemplary
altogether
she
the
forlorner
sacrifice
and
victim
he
she
had
that
tenderness
for
his
melancholy
fate
that
his
great
red
countenance
used
to
break
out
into
cold
perspirations
when
she
looked
at
him
meanwhile
the
marriage
was
appointed
to
be
solemnized
in
eight
weeks
time
and
bounderby
went
every
evening
to
stone
lodge
as
an
accepted
wooer
love
was
made
on
these
occasions
in
the
form
of
bracelets
and
on
all
occasions
during
the
period
of
betrothal
took
a
manufacturing
aspect
dresses
were
made
jewellery
was
made
cakes
and
gloves
were
made
settlements
were
made
and
an
extensive
assortment
of
facts
did
appropriate
honour
to
the
contract
the
business
was
all
fact
from
first
to
last
the
hours
did
not
go
through
any
of
those
rosy
performances
which
foolish
poets
have
ascribed
to
them
at
such
times
neither
did
the
clocks
go
any
faster
or
any
slower
than
at
other
seasons
the
deadly
statistical
recorder
in
the
gradgrind
observatory
knocked
every
second
on
the
head
as
it
was
born
and
buried
it
with
his
accustomed
regularity
so
the
day
came
as
all
other
days
come
to
people
who
will
only
stick
to
reason
and
when
it
came
there
were
married
in
the
church
of
the
florid
wooden
popular
order
of
bounderby
esquire
of
coketown
to
louisa
eldest
daughter
of
thomas
gradgrind
esquire
of
stone
lodge
for
that
borough
and
when
they
were
united
in
holy
matrimony
they
went
home
to
breakfast
at
stone
lodge
aforesaid
there
was
an
improving
party
assembled
on
the
auspicious
occasion
who
knew
what
everything
they
had
to
eat
and
drink
was
made
of
and
how
it
was
imported
or
exported
and
in
what
quantities
and
in
what
bottoms
whether
native
or
foreign
and
all
about
it
the
bridesmaids
down
to
little
jane
gradgrind
were
in
an
intellectual
point
of
view
fit
helpmates
for
the
calculating
boy
and
there
was
no
nonsense
about
any
of
the
company
after
breakfast
the
bridegroom
addressed
them
in
the
following
terms
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
am
josiah
bounderby
of
coketown
since
you
have
done
my
wife
and
myself
the
honour
of
drinking
our
healths
and
happiness
i
suppose
i
must
acknowledge
the
same
though
as
you
all
know
me
and
know
what
i
am
and
what
my
extraction
was
you
won
t
expect
a
speech
from
a
man
who
when
he
sees
a
post
says
that
s
a
post
and
when
he
sees
a
pump
says
that
s
a
pump
and
is
not
to
be
got
to
call
a
post
a
pump
or
a
pump
a
post
or
either
of
them
a
toothpick
if
you
want
a
speech
this
morning
my
friend
and
tom
gradgrind
is
a
member
of
parliament
and
you
know
where
to
get
it
i
am
not
your
man
however
if
i
feel
a
little
independent
when
i
look
around
this
table
and
reflect
how
little
i
thought
of
marrying
tom
gradgrind
s
daughter
when
i
was
a
ragged
who
never
washed
his
face
unless
it
was
at
a
pump
and
that
not
oftener
than
once
a
fortnight
i
hope
i
may
be
excused
so
i
hope
you
like
my
feeling
independent
if
you
don
t
i
can
t
help
it
i
feel
independent
now
i
have
mentioned
and
you
have
mentioned
that
i
am
this
day
married
to
tom
gradgrind
s
daughter
i
am
very
glad
to
be
so
it
has
long
been
my
wish
to
be
so
i
have
watched
her
and
i
believe
she
is
worthy
of
me
at
the
same
to
deceive
believe
i
am
worthy
of
her
so
i
thank
you
on
both
our
parts
for
the
you
have
shown
towards
us
and
the
best
wish
i
can
give
the
unmarried
part
of
the
present
company
is
this
i
hope
every
bachelor
may
find
as
good
a
wife
as
i
have
found
and
i
hope
every
spinster
may
find
as
good
a
husband
as
my
wife
has
shortly
after
which
oration
as
they
were
going
on
a
nuptial
trip
to
lyons
in
order
that
bounderby
might
take
the
opportunity
of
seeing
how
the
hands
got
on
in
those
parts
and
whether
they
too
required
to
be
fed
with
gold
spoons
the
happy
pair
departed
for
the
railroad
the
bride
in
passing
dressed
for
her
journey
found
tom
waiting
for
either
with
his
feelings
or
the
vinous
part
of
the
breakfast
what
a
game
girl
you
are
to
be
such
a
sister
loo
whispered
tom
she
clung
to
him
as
she
should
have
clung
to
some
far
better
nature
that
day
and
was
a
little
shaken
in
her
reserved
composure
for
the
first
time
old
bounderby
s
quite
ready
said
tom
time
s
up
i
shall
be
on
the
for
you
when
you
come
back
i
say
my
dear
loo
an
t
it
uncommonly
jolly
now
end
of
the
first
book
book
the
second
chapter
i
effects
in
the
bank
a
sunny
midsummer
day
there
was
such
a
thing
sometimes
even
in
coketown
seen
from
a
distance
in
such
weather
coketown
lay
shrouded
in
a
haze
of
its
own
which
appeared
impervious
to
the
sun
s
rays
you
only
knew
the
town
was
there
because
you
knew
there
could
have
been
no
such
sulky
blotch
upon
the
prospect
without
a
town
a
blur
of
soot
and
smoke
now
confusedly
tending
this
way
now
that
way
now
aspiring
to
the
vault
of
heaven
now
murkily
creeping
along
the
earth
as
the
wind
rose
and
fell
or
changed
its
quarter
a
dense
formless
jumble
with
sheets
of
cross
light
in
it
that
showed
nothing
but
masses
of
darkness
in
the
distance
was
suggestive
of
itself
though
not
a
brick
of
it
could
be
seen
the
wonder
was
it
was
there
at
all
it
had
been
ruined
so
often
that
it
was
amazing
how
it
had
borne
so
many
shocks
surely
there
never
was
such
fragile
as
that
of
which
the
millers
of
coketown
were
made
handle
them
never
so
lightly
and
they
fell
to
pieces
with
such
ease
that
you
might
suspect
them
of
having
been
flawed
before
they
were
ruined
when
they
were
required
to
send
labouring
children
to
school
they
were
ruined
when
inspectors
were
appointed
to
look
into
their
works
they
were
ruined
when
such
inspectors
considered
it
doubtful
whether
they
were
quite
justified
in
chopping
people
up
with
their
machinery
they
were
utterly
undone
when
it
was
hinted
that
perhaps
they
need
not
always
make
quite
so
much
smoke
besides
bounderby
s
gold
spoon
which
was
generally
received
in
coketown
another
prevalent
fiction
was
very
popular
there
it
took
the
form
of
a
threat
whenever
a
coketowner
felt
he
was
is
to
say
whenever
he
was
not
left
entirely
alone
and
it
was
proposed
to
hold
him
accountable
for
the
consequences
of
any
of
his
was
sure
to
come
out
with
the
awful
menace
that
he
would
sooner
pitch
his
property
into
the
this
had
terrified
the
home
secretary
within
an
inch
of
his
life
on
several
occasions
however
the
coketowners
were
so
patriotic
after
all
that
they
never
had
pitched
their
property
into
the
atlantic
yet
but
on
the
contrary
had
been
kind
enough
to
take
mighty
good
care
of
it
so
there
it
was
in
the
haze
yonder
and
it
increased
and
multiplied
the
streets
were
hot
and
dusty
on
the
summer
day
and
the
sun
was
so
bright
that
it
even
shone
through
the
heavy
vapour
drooping
over
coketown
and
could
not
be
looked
at
steadily
stokers
emerged
from
low
underground
doorways
into
factory
yards
and
sat
on
steps
and
posts
and
palings
wiping
their
swarthy
visages
and
contemplating
coals
the
whole
town
seemed
to
be
frying
in
oil
there
was
a
stifling
smell
of
hot
oil
everywhere
the
shone
with
it
the
dresses
of
the
hands
were
soiled
with
it
the
mills
throughout
their
many
stories
oozed
and
trickled
it
the
atmosphere
of
those
fairy
palaces
was
like
the
breath
of
the
simoom
and
their
inhabitants
wasting
with
heat
toiled
languidly
in
the
desert
but
no
temperature
made
the
melancholy
mad
elephants
more
mad
or
more
sane
their
wearisome
heads
went
up
and
down
at
the
same
rate
in
hot
weather
and
cold
wet
weather
and
dry
fair
weather
and
foul
the
measured
motion
of
their
shadows
on
the
walls
was
the
substitute
coketown
had
to
show
for
the
shadows
of
rustling
woods
while
for
the
summer
hum
of
insects
it
could
offer
all
the
year
round
from
the
dawn
of
monday
to
the
night
of
saturday
the
whirr
of
shafts
and
wheels
drowsily
they
whirred
all
through
this
sunny
day
making
the
passenger
more
sleepy
and
more
hot
as
he
passed
the
humming
walls
of
the
mills
and
sprinklings
of
water
a
little
cooled
the
main
streets
and
the
shops
but
the
mills
and
the
courts
and
alleys
baked
at
a
fierce
heat
down
upon
the
river
that
was
black
and
thick
with
dye
some
coketown
boys
who
were
at
rare
sight
a
crazy
boat
which
made
a
spumous
track
upon
the
water
as
it
jogged
along
while
every
dip
of
an
oar
stirred
up
vile
smells
but
the
sun
itself
however
beneficent
generally
was
less
kind
to
coketown
than
hard
frost
and
rarely
looked
intently
into
any
of
its
closer
regions
without
engendering
more
death
than
life
so
does
the
eye
of
heaven
itself
become
an
evil
eye
when
incapable
or
sordid
hands
are
interposed
between
it
and
the
things
it
looks
upon
to
bless
sparsit
sat
in
her
afternoon
apartment
at
the
bank
on
the
shadier
side
of
the
frying
street

over
and
at
that
period
of
the
day
in
warm
weather
she
usually
embellished
with
her
genteel
presence
a
managerial
over
the
public
office
her
own
private
was
a
story
higher
at
the
window
of
which
post
of
observation
she
was
ready
every
morning
to
greet
bounderby
as
he
came
across
the
road
with
the
sympathizing
recognition
appropriate
to
a
victim
he
had
been
married
now
a
year
and
sparsit
had
never
released
him
from
her
determined
pity
a
moment
the
bank
offered
no
violence
to
the
wholesome
monotony
of
the
town
it
was
another
red
brick
house
with
black
outside
shutters
green
inside
blinds
a
black
up
two
white
steps
a
brazen
and
a
brazen
full
stop
it
was
a
size
larger
than
bounderby
s
house
as
other
houses
were
from
a
size
to
sizes
smaller
in
all
other
particulars
it
was
strictly
according
to
pattern
sparsit
was
conscious
that
by
coming
in
the
among
the
desks
and
writing
implements
she
shed
a
feminine
not
to
say
also
aristocratic
grace
upon
the
office
seated
with
her
needlework
or
netting
apparatus
at
the
window
she
had
a
sense
of
correcting
by
her
ladylike
deportment
the
rude
business
aspect
of
the
place
with
this
impression
of
her
interesting
character
upon
her
sparsit
considered
herself
in
some
sort
the
bank
fairy
the
townspeople
who
in
their
passing
and
repassing
saw
her
there
regarded
her
as
the
bank
dragon
keeping
watch
over
the
treasures
of
the
mine
what
those
treasures
were
sparsit
knew
as
little
as
they
did
gold
and
silver
coin
precious
paper
secrets
that
if
divulged
would
bring
vague
destruction
upon
vague
persons
generally
however
people
whom
she
disliked
were
the
chief
items
in
her
ideal
catalogue
thereof
for
the
rest
she
knew
that
after
she
reigned
supreme
over
all
the
office
furniture
and
over
a
iron
room
with
three
locks
against
the
door
of
which
strong
chamber
the
light
porter
laid
his
head
every
night
on
a
truckle
bed
that
disappeared
at
cockcrow
further
she
was
lady
paramount
over
certain
vaults
in
the
basement
sharply
spiked
off
from
communication
with
the
predatory
world
and
over
the
relics
of
the
current
day
s
work
consisting
of
blots
of
ink
pens
fragments
of
wafers
and
scraps
of
paper
torn
so
small
that
nothing
interesting
could
ever
be
deciphered
on
them
when
sparsit
tried
lastly
she
was
guardian
over
a
little
armoury
of
cutlasses
and
carbines
arrayed
in
vengeful
order
above
one
of
the
official
and
over
that
respectable
tradition
never
to
be
separated
from
a
place
of
business
claiming
to
be
row
of
calculated
to
be
of
no
physical
utility
on
any
occasion
but
observed
to
exercise
a
fine
moral
influence
almost
equal
to
bullion
on
most
beholders
a
deaf
and
the
light
porter
completed
sparsit
s
empire
the
deaf
was
rumoured
to
be
wealthy
and
a
saying
had
for
years
gone
about
among
the
lower
orders
of
coketown
that
she
would
be
murdered
some
night
when
the
bank
was
shut
for
the
sake
of
her
money
it
was
generally
considered
indeed
that
she
had
been
due
some
time
and
ought
to
have
fallen
long
ago
but
she
had
kept
her
life
and
her
situation
with
an
tenacity
that
occasioned
much
offence
and
disappointment
sparsit
s
tea
was
just
set
for
her
on
a
pert
little
table
with
its
tripod
of
legs
in
an
attitude
which
she
insinuated
after
into
the
company
of
the
stern
long
that
bestrode
the
middle
of
the
room
the
light
porter
placed
the
on
it
knuckling
his
forehead
as
a
form
of
homage
thank
you
bitzer
said
sparsit
thank
ma
am
returned
the
light
porter
he
was
a
very
light
porter
indeed
as
light
as
in
the
days
when
he
blinkingly
defined
a
horse
for
girl
number
twenty
all
is
shut
up
bitzer
said
sparsit
all
is
shut
up
ma
and
what
said
sparsit
pouring
out
her
tea
is
the
news
of
the
day
anything
well
ma
am
i
can
t
say
that
i
have
heard
anything
particular
our
people
are
a
bad
lot
ma
am
but
that
is
no
news
what
are
the
restless
wretches
doing
now
asked
sparsit
merely
going
on
in
the
old
way
ma
am
uniting
and
leaguing
and
engaging
to
stand
by
one
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
said
sparsit
making
her
nose
more
roman
and
her
eyebrows
more
coriolanian
in
the
strength
of
her
severity
that
the
united
masters
allow
of
any
such
yes
ma
am
said
bitzer
being
united
themselves
they
ought
one
and
all
to
set
their
faces
against
employing
any
man
who
is
united
with
any
other
man
said
sparsit
they
have
done
that
ma
am
returned
bitzer
but
it
rather
fell
through
ma
i
do
not
pretend
to
understand
these
things
said
sparsit
with
dignity
my
lot
having
been
signally
cast
in
a
widely
different
sphere
and
sparsit
as
a
powler
being
also
quite
out
of
the
pale
of
any
such
dissensions
i
only
know
that
these
people
must
be
conquered
and
that
it
s
high
time
it
was
done
once
for
yes
ma
am
returned
bitzer
with
a
demonstration
of
great
respect
for
sparsit
s
oracular
authority
you
couldn
t
put
it
clearer
i
am
sure
ma
as
this
was
his
usual
hour
for
having
a
little
confidential
chat
with
sparsit
and
as
he
had
already
caught
her
eye
and
seen
that
she
was
going
to
ask
him
something
he
made
a
pretence
of
arranging
the
rulers
inkstands
and
so
forth
while
that
lady
went
on
with
her
tea
glancing
through
the
open
window
down
into
the
street
has
it
been
a
busy
day
bitzer
asked
sparsit
not
a
very
busy
day
my
lady
about
an
average
he
now
and
then
slided
into
my
lady
instead
of
ma
am
as
an
involuntary
acknowledgment
of
sparsit
s
personal
dignity
and
claims
to
reverence
the
clerks
said
sparsit
carefully
brushing
an
imperceptible
crumb
of
bread
and
butter
from
her
mitten
are
trustworthy
punctual
and
industrious
of
course
yes
ma
am
pretty
fair
ma
am
with
the
usual
he
held
the
respectable
office
of
general
spy
and
informer
in
the
establishment
for
which
volunteer
service
he
received
a
present
at
christmas
over
and
above
his
weekly
wage
he
had
grown
into
an
extremely
cautious
prudent
young
man
who
was
safe
to
rise
in
the
world
his
mind
was
so
exactly
regulated
that
he
had
no
affections
or
passions
all
his
proceedings
were
the
result
of
the
nicest
and
coldest
calculation
and
it
was
not
without
cause
that
sparsit
habitually
observed
of
him
that
he
was
a
young
man
of
the
steadiest
principle
she
had
ever
known
having
satisfied
himself
on
his
father
s
death
that
his
mother
had
a
right
of
settlement
in
coketown
this
excellent
young
economist
had
asserted
that
right
for
her
with
such
a
steadfast
adherence
to
the
principle
of
the
case
that
she
had
been
shut
up
in
the
workhouse
ever
since
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
allowed
her
half
a
pound
of
tea
a
year
which
was
weak
in
him
first
because
all
gifts
have
an
inevitable
tendency
to
pauperise
the
recipient
and
secondly
because
his
only
reasonable
transaction
in
that
commodity
would
have
been
to
buy
it
for
as
little
as
he
could
possibly
give
and
sell
it
for
as
much
as
he
could
possibly
get
it
having
been
clearly
ascertained
by
philosophers
that
in
this
is
comprised
the
whole
duty
of
a
part
of
man
s
duty
but
the
whole
pretty
fair
ma
am
with
the
usual
exception
ma
am
repeated
bitzer
said
sparsit
shaking
her
head
over
her
and
taking
a
long
gulp
mr
thomas
ma
am
i
doubt
thomas
very
much
ma
am
i
don
t
like
his
ways
at
bitzer
said
sparsit
in
a
very
impressive
manner
do
you
recollect
my
having
said
anything
to
you
respecting
names
i
beg
your
pardon
ma
am
it
s
quite
true
that
you
did
object
to
names
being
used
and
they
re
always
best
please
to
remember
that
i
have
a
charge
here
said
sparsit
with
her
air
of
state
i
hold
a
trust
here
bitzer
under
bounderby
however
improbable
both
bounderby
and
myself
might
have
deemed
it
years
ago
that
he
would
ever
become
my
patron
making
me
an
annual
compliment
i
can
not
but
regard
him
in
that
light
from
bounderby
i
have
received
every
acknowledgment
of
my
social
station
and
every
recognition
of
my
family
descent
that
i
could
possibly
expect
more
far
more
therefore
to
my
patron
i
will
be
scrupulously
true
and
i
do
not
consider
i
will
not
consider
i
can
not
consider
said
sparsit
with
a
most
extensive
stock
on
hand
of
honour
and
morality
that
i
be
scrupulously
true
if
i
allowed
names
to
be
mentioned
under
this
roof
that
are
doubt
of
with
bitzer
knuckled
his
forehead
again
and
again
begged
pardon
no
bitzer
continued
sparsit
say
an
individual
and
i
will
hear
you
say
thomas
and
you
must
excuse
with
the
usual
exception
ma
am
said
bitzer
trying
back
of
an
sparsit
repeated
the
ejaculation
the
shake
of
the
head
over
her
and
the
long
gulp
as
taking
up
the
conversation
again
at
the
point
where
it
had
been
interrupted
an
individual
ma
am
said
bitzer
has
never
been
what
he
ought
to
have
been
since
he
first
came
into
the
place
he
is
a
dissipated
extravagant
idler
he
is
not
worth
his
salt
ma
am
he
wouldn
t
get
it
either
if
he
hadn
t
a
friend
and
relation
at
court
ma
am
said
sparsit
with
another
melancholy
shake
of
her
head
i
only
hope
ma
am
pursued
bitzer
that
his
friend
and
relation
may
not
supply
him
with
the
means
of
carrying
on
otherwise
ma
am
we
know
out
of
whose
pocket
money
sighed
sparsit
again
with
another
melancholy
shake
of
her
head
he
is
to
be
pitied
ma
am
the
last
party
i
have
alluded
to
is
to
be
pitied
ma
am
said
bitzer
yes
bitzer
said
sparsit
i
have
always
pitied
the
delusion
as
to
an
individual
ma
am
said
bitzer
dropping
his
voice
and
drawing
nearer
he
is
as
improvident
as
any
of
the
people
in
this
town
and
you
know
what
improvidence
is
ma
am
no
one
could
wish
to
know
it
better
than
a
lady
of
your
eminence
they
would
do
well
returned
sparsit
to
take
example
by
you
thank
you
ma
am
but
since
you
do
refer
to
me
now
look
at
me
ma
am
i
have
put
by
a
little
ma
am
already
that
gratuity
which
i
receive
at
christmas
ma
am
i
never
touch
it
i
don
t
even
go
the
length
of
my
wages
though
they
re
not
high
ma
am
why
can
t
they
do
as
i
have
done
ma
am
what
one
person
can
do
another
can
this
again
was
among
the
fictions
of
coketown
any
capitalist
there
who
had
made
sixty
thousand
pounds
out
of
sixpence
always
professed
to
wonder
why
the
sixty
thousand
nearest
hands
didn
t
each
make
sixty
thousand
pounds
out
of
sixpence
and
more
or
less
reproached
them
every
one
for
not
accomplishing
the
little
feat
what
i
did
you
can
do
why
don
t
you
go
and
do
it
as
to
their
wanting
recreations
ma
am
said
bitzer
it
s
stuff
and
nonsense
don
t
want
recreations
i
never
did
and
i
never
shall
i
don
t
like
em
as
to
their
combining
together
there
are
many
of
them
i
have
no
doubt
that
by
watching
and
informing
upon
one
another
could
earn
a
trifle
now
and
then
whether
in
money
or
good
will
and
improve
their
livelihood
then
why
don
t
they
improve
it
ma
am
it
s
the
first
consideration
of
a
rational
creature
and
it
s
what
they
pretend
to
pretend
indeed
said
sparsit
i
am
sure
we
are
constantly
hearing
ma
am
till
it
becomes
quite
nauseous
concerning
their
wives
and
families
said
bitzer
why
look
at
me
ma
am
i
don
t
want
a
wife
and
family
why
should
they
because
they
are
improvident
said
sparsit
yes
ma
am
returned
bitzer
that
s
where
it
is
if
they
were
more
provident
and
less
perverse
ma
am
what
would
they
do
they
would
say
while
my
hat
covers
my
family
or
while
my
bonnet
covers
my
family
the
case
might
be
ma
i
have
only
one
to
feed
and
that
s
the
person
i
most
like
to
to
be
sure
assented
sparsit
eating
muffin
thank
you
ma
am
said
bitzer
knuckling
his
forehead
again
in
return
for
the
favour
of
sparsit
s
improving
conversation
would
you
wish
a
little
more
hot
water
ma
am
or
is
there
anything
else
that
i
could
fetch
you
nothing
just
now
thank
you
ma
am
i
shouldn
t
wish
to
disturb
you
at
your
meals
ma
am
particularly
tea
knowing
your
partiality
for
it
said
bitzer
craning
a
little
to
look
over
into
the
street
from
where
he
stood
but
there
s
a
gentleman
been
looking
up
here
for
a
minute
or
so
ma
am
and
he
has
come
across
as
if
he
was
going
to
knock
that
his
knock
ma
am
no
he
stepped
to
the
window
and
looking
out
and
drawing
in
his
head
again
confirmed
himself
with
yes
ma
am
would
you
wish
the
gentleman
to
be
shown
in
ma
am
i
don
t
know
who
it
can
be
said
sparsit
wiping
her
mouth
and
arranging
her
mittens
a
stranger
ma
am
what
a
stranger
can
want
at
the
bank
at
this
time
of
the
evening
unless
he
comes
upon
some
business
for
which
he
is
too
late
i
don
t
know
said
sparsit
but
i
hold
a
charge
in
this
establishment
from
bounderby
and
i
will
never
shrink
from
it
if
to
see
him
is
any
part
of
the
duty
i
have
accepted
i
will
see
him
use
your
own
discretion
here
the
visitor
all
unconscious
of
sparsit
s
magnanimous
words
repeated
his
knock
so
loudly
that
the
light
porter
hastened
down
to
open
the
door
while
sparsit
took
the
precaution
of
concealing
her
little
table
with
all
its
appliances
upon
it
in
a
cupboard
and
then
decamped
that
she
might
appear
if
needful
with
the
greater
dignity
if
you
please
ma
am
the
gentleman
would
wish
to
see
you
said
bitzer
with
his
light
eye
at
sparsit
s
keyhole
so
sparsit
who
had
improved
the
interval
by
touching
up
her
cap
took
her
classical
features
again
and
entered
the
in
the
manner
of
a
roman
matron
going
outside
the
city
walls
to
treat
with
an
invading
general
the
visitor
having
strolled
to
the
window
and
being
then
engaged
in
looking
carelessly
out
was
as
unmoved
by
this
impressive
entry
as
man
could
possibly
be
he
stood
whistling
to
himself
with
all
imaginable
coolness
with
his
hat
still
on
and
a
certain
air
of
exhaustion
upon
him
in
part
arising
from
excessive
summer
and
in
part
from
excessive
gentility
for
it
was
to
be
seen
with
half
an
eye
that
he
was
a
thorough
gentleman
made
to
the
model
of
the
time
weary
of
everything
and
putting
no
more
faith
in
anything
than
lucifer
i
believe
sir
quoth
sparsit
you
wished
to
see
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
turning
and
removing
his
hat
pray
excuse
humph
thought
sparsit
as
she
made
a
stately
bend
five
and
thirty
good
figure
good
teeth
good
voice
good
breeding
dark
hair
bold
all
which
sparsit
observed
in
her
womanly
the
sultan
who
put
his
head
in
the
pail
of
in
dipping
down
and
coming
up
again
please
to
be
seated
sir
said
sparsit
thank
you
allow
he
placed
a
chair
for
her
but
remained
himself
carelessly
lounging
against
the
table
i
left
my
servant
at
the
railway
looking
after
the
heavy
train
and
vast
quantity
of
it
in
the
strolled
on
looking
about
me
exceedingly
odd
place
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
if
it
s
as
black
as
this
in
general
much
blacker
returned
sparsit
in
her
uncompromising
way
is
it
possible
excuse
me
you
are
not
a
native
i
think
no
sir
returned
sparsit
it
was
once
my
good
or
ill
fortune
as
it
may
i
became
a
move
in
a
very
different
sphere
my
husband
was
a
beg
your
pardon
really
said
the
stranger
sparsit
repeated
a
powler
family
said
the
stranger
after
reflecting
a
few
moments
sparsit
signified
assent
the
stranger
seemed
a
little
more
fatigued
than
before
you
must
be
very
much
bored
here
was
the
inference
he
drew
from
the
communication
i
am
the
servant
of
circumstances
sir
said
sparsit
and
i
have
long
adapted
myself
to
the
governing
power
of
my
very
philosophical
returned
the
stranger
and
very
exemplary
and
laudable
it
seemed
to
be
scarcely
worth
his
while
to
finish
the
sentence
so
he
played
with
his
wearily
may
i
be
permitted
to
ask
sir
said
sparsit
to
what
i
am
indebted
for
the
favour
assuredly
said
the
stranger
much
obliged
to
you
for
reminding
me
i
am
the
bearer
of
a
letter
of
introduction
to
bounderby
the
banker
walking
through
this
extraordinarily
black
town
while
they
were
getting
dinner
ready
at
the
hotel
i
asked
a
fellow
whom
i
met
one
of
the
working
people
who
appeared
to
have
been
taking
a
of
something
fluffy
which
i
assume
to
be
the
raw
sparsit
inclined
her
head
bounderby
the
banker
might
reside
upon
which
misled
no
doubt
by
the
word
banker
he
directed
me
to
the
bank
fact
being
i
presume
that
bounderby
the
banker
does
reside
in
the
edifice
in
which
i
have
the
honour
of
offering
this
explanation
no
sir
returned
sparsit
he
does
thank
you
i
had
no
intention
of
delivering
my
letter
at
the
present
moment
nor
have
i
but
strolling
on
to
the
bank
to
kill
time
and
having
the
good
fortune
to
observe
at
the
window
towards
which
he
languidly
waved
his
hand
then
slightly
bowed
a
lady
of
a
very
superior
and
agreeable
appearance
i
considered
that
i
could
not
do
better
than
take
the
liberty
of
asking
that
lady
where
bounderby
the
banker
live
which
i
accordingly
venture
with
all
suitable
apologies
to
the
inattention
and
indolence
of
his
manner
were
sufficiently
relieved
to
sparsit
s
thinking
by
a
certain
gallantry
at
ease
which
offered
her
homage
too
here
he
was
for
instance
at
this
moment
all
but
sitting
on
the
table
and
yet
lazily
bending
over
her
as
if
he
acknowledged
an
attraction
in
her
that
made
her
her
way
banks
i
know
are
always
suspicious
and
officially
must
be
said
the
stranger
whose
lightness
and
smoothness
of
speech
were
pleasant
likewise
suggesting
matter
far
more
sensible
and
humorous
than
it
ever
was
perhaps
a
shrewd
device
of
the
founder
of
this
numerous
sect
whosoever
may
have
been
that
great
man
therefore
i
may
observe
that
my
it
from
the
member
for
this
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
in
sparsit
recognized
the
hand
intimated
that
such
confirmation
was
quite
unnecessary
and
gave
bounderby
s
address
with
all
needful
clues
and
directions
in
aid
thousand
thanks
said
the
stranger
of
course
you
know
the
banker
well
yes
sir
rejoined
sparsit
in
my
dependent
relation
towards
him
i
have
known
him
ten
quite
an
eternity
i
think
he
married
gradgrind
s
daughter
yes
said
sparsit
suddenly
compressing
her
mouth
he
had
the
lady
is
quite
a
philosopher
i
am
told
indeed
sir
said
sparsit
she
excuse
my
impertinent
curiosity
pursued
the
stranger
fluttering
over
sparsit
s
eyebrows
with
a
propitiatory
air
but
you
know
the
family
and
know
the
world
i
am
about
to
know
the
family
and
may
have
much
to
do
with
them
is
the
lady
so
very
alarming
her
father
gives
her
such
a
portentously
reputation
that
i
have
a
burning
desire
to
know
is
she
absolutely
unapproachable
repellently
and
stunningly
clever
i
see
by
your
meaning
smile
you
think
not
you
have
poured
balm
into
my
anxious
soul
as
to
age
now
forty
five
and
thirty
sparsit
laughed
outright
a
chit
said
she
not
twenty
when
she
was
i
give
you
my
honour
powler
returned
the
stranger
detaching
himself
from
the
table
that
i
never
was
so
astonished
in
my
life
it
really
did
seem
to
impress
him
to
the
utmost
extent
of
his
capacity
of
being
impressed
he
looked
at
his
informant
for
full
a
quarter
of
a
minute
and
appeared
to
have
the
surprise
in
his
mind
all
the
time
i
assure
you
powler
he
then
said
much
exhausted
that
the
father
s
manner
prepared
me
for
a
grim
and
stony
maturity
i
am
obliged
to
you
of
all
things
for
correcting
so
absurd
a
mistake
pray
excuse
my
intrusion
many
thanks
good
day
he
bowed
himself
out
and
sparsit
hiding
in
the
window
curtain
saw
him
languishing
down
the
street
on
the
shady
side
of
the
way
observed
of
all
the
town
what
do
you
think
of
the
gentleman
bitzer
she
asked
the
light
porter
when
he
came
to
take
away
spends
a
deal
of
money
on
his
dress
ma
it
must
be
admitted
said
sparsit
that
it
s
very
yes
ma
am
returned
bitzer
if
that
s
worth
the
besides
which
ma
am
resumed
bitzer
while
he
was
polishing
the
table
he
looks
to
me
as
if
he
it
s
immoral
to
game
said
sparsit
it
s
ridiculous
ma
am
said
bitzer
because
the
chances
are
against
the
whether
it
was
that
the
heat
prevented
sparsit
from
working
or
whether
it
was
that
her
hand
was
out
she
did
no
work
that
night
she
sat
at
the
window
when
the
sun
began
to
sink
behind
the
smoke
she
sat
there
when
the
smoke
was
burning
red
when
the
colour
faded
from
it
when
darkness
seemed
to
rise
slowly
out
of
the
ground
and
creep
upward
upward
up
to
the
up
the
church
steeple
up
to
the
summits
of
the
factory
chimneys
up
to
the
sky
without
a
candle
in
the
room
sparsit
sat
at
the
window
with
her
hands
before
her
not
thinking
much
of
the
sounds
of
evening
the
whooping
of
boys
the
barking
of
dogs
the
rumbling
of
wheels
the
steps
and
voices
of
passengers
the
shrill
street
cries
the
clogs
upon
the
pavement
when
it
was
their
hour
for
going
by
the
of
not
until
the
light
porter
announced
that
her
nocturnal
sweetbread
was
ready
did
sparsit
arouse
herself
from
her
reverie
and
convey
her
dense
black
that
time
creased
with
meditation
as
if
they
needed
ironing
o
you
fool
said
sparsit
when
she
was
alone
at
her
supper
whom
she
meant
she
did
not
say
but
she
could
scarcely
have
meant
the
sweetbread
chapter
ii
james
harthouse
the
gradgrind
party
wanted
assistance
in
cutting
the
throats
of
the
graces
they
went
about
recruiting
and
where
could
they
enlist
recruits
more
hopefully
than
among
the
fine
gentlemen
who
having
found
out
everything
to
be
worth
nothing
were
equally
ready
for
anything
moreover
the
healthy
spirits
who
had
mounted
to
this
sublime
height
were
attractive
to
many
of
the
gradgrind
school
they
liked
fine
gentlemen
they
pretended
that
they
did
not
but
they
did
they
became
exhausted
in
imitation
of
them
and
they
in
their
speech
like
them
and
they
served
out
with
an
enervated
air
the
little
mouldy
rations
of
political
economy
on
which
they
regaled
their
disciples
there
never
before
was
seen
on
earth
such
a
wonderful
hybrid
race
as
was
thus
produced
among
the
fine
gentlemen
not
regularly
belonging
to
the
gradgrind
school
there
was
one
of
a
good
family
and
a
better
appearance
with
a
happy
turn
of
humour
which
had
told
immensely
with
the
house
of
commons
on
the
occasion
of
his
entertaining
it
with
his
and
the
board
of
directors
view
of
a
railway
accident
in
which
the
most
careful
officers
ever
known
employed
by
the
most
liberal
managers
ever
heard
of
assisted
by
the
finest
mechanical
contrivances
ever
devised
the
whole
in
action
on
the
best
line
ever
constructed
had
killed
five
people
and
wounded
by
a
casualty
without
which
the
excellence
of
the
whole
system
would
have
been
positively
incomplete
among
the
slain
was
a
cow
and
among
the
scattered
articles
unowned
a
widow
s
cap
and
the
honourable
member
had
so
tickled
the
house
which
has
a
delicate
sense
of
humour
by
putting
the
cap
on
the
cow
that
it
became
impatient
of
any
serious
reference
to
the
coroner
s
inquest
and
brought
the
railway
off
with
cheers
and
laughter
now
this
gentleman
had
a
younger
brother
of
still
better
appearance
than
himself
who
had
tried
life
as
a
cornet
of
dragoons
and
found
it
a
bore
and
had
afterwards
tried
it
in
the
train
of
an
english
minister
abroad
and
found
it
a
bore
and
had
then
strolled
to
jerusalem
and
got
bored
there
and
had
then
gone
yachting
about
the
world
and
got
bored
everywhere
to
whom
this
honourable
and
jocular
member
fraternally
said
one
day
jem
there
s
a
good
opening
among
the
hard
fact
fellows
and
they
want
men
i
wonder
you
don
t
go
in
for
jem
rather
taken
by
the
novelty
of
the
idea
and
very
hard
up
for
a
change
was
as
ready
to
go
in
for
statistics
as
for
anything
else
so
he
went
in
he
coached
himself
up
with
a
or
two
and
his
brother
put
it
about
among
the
hard
fact
fellows
and
said
if
you
want
to
bring
in
for
any
place
a
handsome
dog
who
can
make
you
a
devilish
good
speech
look
after
my
brother
jem
for
he
s
your
after
a
few
dashes
in
the
public
meeting
way
gradgrind
and
a
council
of
political
sages
approved
of
jem
and
it
was
resolved
to
send
him
down
to
coketown
to
become
known
there
and
in
the
neighbourhood
hence
the
letter
jem
had
last
night
shown
to
sparsit
which
bounderby
now
held
in
his
hand
superscribed
josiah
bounderby
esquire
banker
coketown
specially
to
introduce
james
harthouse
esquire
thomas
within
an
hour
of
the
receipt
of
this
dispatch
and
james
harthouse
s
card
bounderby
put
on
his
hat
and
went
down
to
the
hotel
there
he
found
james
harthouse
looking
out
of
window
in
a
state
of
mind
so
disconsolate
that
he
was
already
to
go
in
for
something
else
my
name
sir
said
his
visitor
is
josiah
bounderby
of
james
harthouse
was
very
happy
indeed
though
he
scarcely
looked
so
to
have
a
pleasure
he
had
long
expected
coketown
sir
said
bounderby
obstinately
taking
a
chair
is
not
the
kind
of
place
you
have
been
accustomed
to
therefore
if
you
will
allow
whether
you
will
or
not
for
i
am
a
plain
ll
tell
you
something
about
it
before
we
go
any
harthouse
would
be
charmed
don
t
be
too
sure
of
that
said
bounderby
i
don
t
promise
it
first
of
all
you
see
our
smoke
that
s
meat
and
drink
to
us
it
s
the
healthiest
thing
in
the
world
in
all
respects
and
particularly
for
the
lungs
if
you
are
one
of
those
who
want
us
to
consume
it
i
differ
from
you
we
are
not
going
to
wear
the
bottoms
of
our
boilers
out
any
faster
than
we
wear
em
out
now
for
all
the
humbugging
sentiment
in
great
britain
and
by
way
of
going
in
to
the
fullest
extent
harthouse
rejoined
mr
bounderby
i
assure
you
i
am
entirely
and
completely
of
your
way
of
thinking
on
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
bounderby
now
you
have
heard
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
work
in
our
mills
no
doubt
you
have
very
good
i
ll
state
the
fact
of
it
to
you
it
s
the
pleasantest
work
there
is
and
it
s
the
lightest
work
there
is
and
it
s
the
work
there
is
more
than
that
we
couldn
t
improve
the
mills
themselves
unless
we
laid
down
turkey
carpets
on
the
floors
which
we
re
not
to
mr
bounderby
perfectly
lastly
said
bounderby
as
to
our
hands
there
s
not
a
hand
in
this
town
sir
man
woman
or
child
but
has
one
ultimate
object
in
life
that
object
is
to
be
fed
on
turtle
soup
and
venison
with
a
gold
spoon
now
they
re
not
of
to
be
fed
on
turtle
soup
and
venison
with
a
gold
spoon
and
now
you
know
the
harthouse
professed
himself
in
the
highest
degree
instructed
and
refreshed
by
this
condensed
epitome
of
the
whole
coketown
question
why
you
see
replied
bounderby
it
suits
my
disposition
to
have
a
full
understanding
with
a
man
particularly
with
a
public
man
when
i
make
his
acquaintance
i
have
only
one
thing
more
to
say
to
you
harthouse
before
assuring
you
of
the
pleasure
with
which
i
shall
respond
to
the
utmost
of
my
poor
ability
to
my
friend
tom
gradgrind
s
letter
of
introduction
you
are
a
man
of
family
don
t
you
deceive
yourself
by
supposing
for
a
moment
that
i
am
a
man
of
family
i
am
a
bit
of
dirty
and
a
genuine
scrap
of
tag
rag
and
if
anything
could
have
exalted
jem
s
interest
in
bounderby
it
would
have
been
this
very
circumstance
or
so
he
told
him
so
now
said
bounderby
we
may
shake
hands
on
equal
terms
i
say
equal
terms
because
although
i
know
what
i
am
and
the
exact
depth
of
the
gutter
i
have
lifted
myself
out
of
better
than
any
man
does
i
am
as
proud
as
you
are
i
am
just
as
proud
as
you
are
having
now
asserted
my
independence
in
a
proper
manner
i
may
come
to
how
do
you
find
yourself
and
i
hope
you
re
pretty
the
better
harthouse
gave
him
to
understand
as
they
shook
hands
for
the
salubrious
air
of
coketown
bounderby
received
the
answer
with
favour
perhaps
you
know
said
he
or
perhaps
you
don
t
know
i
married
tom
gradgrind
s
daughter
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
walk
up
town
with
me
i
shall
be
glad
to
introduce
you
to
tom
gradgrind
s
mr
bounderby
said
jem
you
anticipate
my
dearest
they
went
out
without
further
discourse
and
bounderby
piloted
the
new
acquaintance
who
so
strongly
contrasted
with
him
to
the
private
red
brick
dwelling
with
the
black
outside
shutters
the
green
inside
blinds
and
the
black
street
door
up
the
two
white
steps
in
the
of
which
mansion
there
presently
entered
to
them
the
most
remarkable
girl
james
harthouse
had
ever
seen
she
was
so
constrained
and
yet
so
careless
so
reserved
and
yet
so
watchful
so
cold
and
proud
and
yet
so
sensitively
ashamed
of
her
husband
s
braggart
which
she
shrunk
as
if
every
example
of
it
were
a
cut
or
a
blow
that
it
was
quite
a
new
sensation
to
observe
her
in
face
she
was
no
less
remarkable
than
in
manner
her
features
were
handsome
but
their
natural
play
was
so
locked
up
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
guess
at
their
genuine
expression
utterly
indifferent
perfectly
never
at
a
loss
and
yet
never
at
her
ease
with
her
figure
in
company
with
them
there
and
her
mind
apparently
quite
was
of
no
use
going
in
yet
awhile
to
comprehend
this
girl
for
she
baffled
all
penetration
from
the
mistress
of
the
house
the
visitor
glanced
to
the
house
itself
there
was
no
mute
sign
of
a
woman
in
the
room
no
graceful
little
adornment
no
fanciful
little
device
however
trivial
anywhere
expressed
her
influence
cheerless
and
comfortless
boastfully
and
doggedly
rich
there
the
room
stared
at
its
present
occupants
unsoftened
and
unrelieved
by
the
least
trace
of
any
womanly
occupation
as
bounderby
stood
in
the
midst
of
his
household
gods
so
those
unrelenting
divinities
occupied
their
places
around
bounderby
and
they
were
worthy
of
one
another
and
well
matched
this
sir
said
bounderby
is
my
wife
bounderby
tom
gradgrind
s
eldest
daughter
loo
james
harthouse
harthouse
has
joined
your
father
s
if
he
is
not
tom
gradgrind
s
colleague
before
long
i
believe
we
shall
at
least
hear
of
him
in
connexion
with
one
of
our
neighbouring
towns
you
observe
harthouse
that
my
wife
is
my
junior
i
don
t
know
what
she
saw
in
me
to
marry
me
but
she
saw
something
in
me
i
suppose
or
she
wouldn
t
have
married
me
she
has
lots
of
expensive
knowledge
sir
political
and
otherwise
if
you
want
to
cram
for
anything
i
should
be
troubled
to
recommend
you
to
a
better
adviser
than
loo
to
a
more
agreeable
adviser
or
one
from
whom
he
would
be
more
likely
to
learn
harthouse
could
never
be
recommended
come
said
his
host
if
you
re
in
the
complimentary
line
you
ll
get
on
here
for
you
ll
meet
with
no
competition
i
have
never
been
in
the
way
of
learning
compliments
myself
and
i
don
t
profess
to
understand
the
art
of
paying
em
in
fact
despise
em
but
your
was
different
from
mine
mine
was
a
real
thing
by
george
you
re
a
gentleman
and
i
don
t
pretend
to
be
one
i
am
josiah
bounderby
of
coketown
and
that
s
enough
for
me
however
though
i
am
not
influenced
by
manners
and
station
loo
bounderby
may
be
she
hadn
t
my
you
would
call
em
but
i
call
em
you
ll
not
waste
your
power
i
dare
mr
bounderby
said
jem
turning
with
a
smile
to
louisa
is
a
noble
animal
in
a
comparatively
natural
state
quite
free
from
the
harness
in
which
a
conventional
hack
like
myself
you
respect
bounderby
very
much
she
quietly
returned
it
is
natural
that
you
he
was
disgracefully
thrown
out
for
a
gentleman
who
had
seen
so
much
of
the
world
and
thought
now
how
am
i
to
take
this
you
are
going
to
devote
yourself
as
i
gather
from
what
bounderby
has
said
to
the
service
of
your
country
you
have
made
up
your
mind
said
louisa
still
standing
before
him
where
she
had
first
all
the
singular
contrariety
of
her
and
her
being
obviously
very
ill
at
to
show
the
nation
the
way
out
of
all
its
mrs
bounderby
he
returned
laughing
upon
my
honour
no
i
will
make
no
such
pretence
to
you
i
have
seen
a
little
here
and
there
up
and
down
i
have
found
it
all
to
be
very
worthless
as
everybody
has
and
as
some
confess
they
have
and
some
do
not
and
i
am
going
in
for
your
respected
father
s
because
i
have
no
choice
of
opinions
and
may
as
well
back
them
as
anything
have
you
none
of
your
own
asked
louisa
i
have
not
so
much
as
the
slightest
predilection
left
i
assure
you
i
attach
not
the
least
importance
to
any
opinions
the
result
of
the
varieties
of
boredom
i
have
undergone
is
a
conviction
unless
conviction
is
too
industrious
a
word
for
the
lazy
sentiment
i
entertain
on
the
subject
that
any
set
of
ideas
will
do
just
as
much
good
as
any
other
set
and
just
as
much
harm
as
any
other
set
there
s
an
english
family
with
a
charming
italian
motto
what
will
be
will
be
it
s
the
only
truth
going
this
vicious
assumption
of
honesty
in
vice
so
dangerous
so
deadly
and
so
he
observed
a
little
to
impress
her
in
his
favour
he
followed
up
the
advantage
by
saying
in
his
pleasantest
manner
a
manner
to
which
she
might
attach
as
much
or
as
little
meaning
as
she
pleased
the
side
that
can
prove
anything
in
a
line
of
units
tens
hundreds
and
thousands
bounderby
seems
to
me
to
afford
the
most
fun
and
to
give
a
man
the
best
chance
i
am
quite
as
much
attached
to
it
as
if
i
believed
it
i
am
quite
ready
to
go
in
for
it
to
the
same
extent
as
if
i
believed
it
and
what
more
could
i
possibly
do
if
i
did
believe
it
you
are
a
singular
politician
said
louisa
pardon
me
i
have
not
even
that
merit
we
are
the
largest
party
in
the
state
i
assure
you
bounderby
if
we
all
fell
out
of
our
adopted
ranks
and
were
reviewed
bounderby
who
had
been
in
danger
of
bursting
in
silence
interposed
here
with
a
project
for
postponing
the
family
dinner
till
six
and
taking
james
harthouse
in
the
meantime
on
a
round
of
visits
to
the
voting
and
interesting
notabilities
of
coketown
and
its
vicinity
the
round
of
visits
was
made
and
james
harthouse
with
a
discreet
use
of
his
blue
coaching
came
off
triumphantly
though
with
a
considerable
accession
of
boredom
in
the
evening
he
found
the
laid
for
four
but
they
sat
down
only
three
it
was
an
appropriate
occasion
for
bounderby
to
discuss
the
flavour
of
the
hap
orth
of
stewed
eels
he
had
purchased
in
the
streets
at
eight
years
old
and
also
of
the
inferior
water
specially
used
for
laying
the
dust
with
which
he
had
washed
down
that
repast
he
likewise
entertained
his
guest
over
the
soup
and
fish
with
the
calculation
that
he
bounderby
had
eaten
in
his
youth
at
least
three
horses
under
the
guise
of
polonies
and
saveloys
these
recitals
jem
in
a
languid
manner
received
with
charming
every
now
and
then
and
they
probably
would
have
decided
him
to
go
in
for
jerusalem
again
morning
had
he
been
less
curious
respecting
louisa
is
there
nothing
he
thought
glancing
at
her
as
she
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
where
her
youthful
figure
small
and
slight
but
very
graceful
looked
as
pretty
as
it
looked
misplaced
is
there
nothing
that
will
move
that
face
yes
by
jupiter
there
was
something
and
here
it
was
in
an
unexpected
shape
tom
appeared
she
changed
as
the
door
opened
and
broke
into
a
beaming
smile
a
beautiful
smile
james
harthouse
might
not
have
thought
so
much
of
it
but
that
he
had
wondered
so
long
at
her
impassive
face
she
put
out
her
pretty
little
soft
hand
and
her
fingers
closed
upon
her
brother
s
as
if
she
would
have
carried
them
to
her
lips
ay
ay
thought
the
visitor
this
whelp
is
the
only
creature
she
cares
for
so
so
the
whelp
was
presented
and
took
his
chair
the
appellation
was
not
flattering
but
not
unmerited
when
i
was
your
age
young
tom
said
bounderby
i
was
punctual
or
i
got
no
dinner
when
you
were
my
age
resumed
tom
you
hadn
t
a
wrong
balance
to
get
right
and
hadn
t
to
dress
never
mind
that
now
said
bounderby
well
then
grumbled
tom
don
t
begin
with
mrs
bounderby
said
harthouse
perfectly
hearing
this
as
it
went
on
your
brother
s
face
is
quite
familiar
to
me
can
i
have
seen
him
abroad
or
at
some
public
school
perhaps
no
she
resumed
quite
interested
he
has
never
been
abroad
yet
and
was
educated
here
at
home
tom
love
i
am
telling
harthouse
that
he
never
saw
you
no
such
luck
sir
said
tom
there
was
little
enough
in
him
to
brighten
her
face
for
he
was
a
sullen
young
fellow
and
ungracious
in
his
manner
even
to
her
so
much
the
greater
must
have
been
the
solitude
of
her
heart
and
her
need
of
some
one
on
whom
to
bestow
it
so
much
the
more
is
this
whelp
the
only
creature
she
has
ever
cared
for
thought
james
harthouse
turning
it
over
and
over
so
much
the
more
so
much
the
both
in
his
sister
s
presence
and
after
she
had
left
the
room
the
whelp
took
no
pains
to
hide
his
contempt
for
bounderby
whenever
he
could
indulge
it
without
the
observation
of
that
independent
man
by
making
wry
faces
or
shutting
one
eye
without
responding
to
these
telegraphic
communications
harthouse
encouraged
him
much
in
the
course
of
the
evening
and
showed
an
unusual
liking
for
him
at
last
when
he
rose
to
return
to
his
hotel
and
was
a
little
doubtful
whether
he
knew
the
way
by
night
the
whelp
immediately
proffered
his
services
as
guide
and
turned
out
with
him
to
escort
him
thither

chapter
iii
the
whelp
it
was
very
remarkable
that
a
young
gentleman
who
had
been
brought
up
under
one
continuous
system
of
unnatural
restraint
should
be
a
hypocrite
but
it
was
certainly
the
case
with
tom
it
was
very
strange
that
a
young
gentleman
who
had
never
been
left
to
his
own
guidance
for
five
consecutive
minutes
should
be
incapable
at
last
of
governing
himself
but
so
it
was
with
tom
it
was
altogether
unaccountable
that
a
young
gentleman
whose
imagination
had
been
strangled
in
his
cradle
should
be
still
inconvenienced
by
its
ghost
in
the
form
of
grovelling
sensualities
but
such
a
monster
beyond
all
doubt
was
tom
do
you
smoke
asked
james
harthouse
when
they
came
to
the
hotel
i
believe
you
said
tom
he
could
do
no
less
than
ask
tom
up
and
tom
could
do
no
less
than
go
up
what
with
a
cooling
drink
adapted
to
the
weather
but
not
so
weak
as
cool
and
what
with
a
rarer
tobacco
than
was
to
be
bought
in
those
parts
tom
was
soon
in
a
highly
free
and
easy
state
at
his
end
of
the
sofa
and
more
than
ever
disposed
to
admire
his
new
friend
at
the
other
end
tom
blew
his
smoke
aside
after
he
had
been
smoking
a
little
while
and
took
an
observation
of
his
friend
he
don
t
seem
to
care
about
his
dress
thought
tom
and
yet
how
capitally
he
does
it
what
an
easy
swell
he
is
james
harthouse
happening
to
catch
tom
s
eye
remarked
that
he
drank
nothing
and
filled
his
glass
with
his
own
negligent
hand
thank
ee
said
tom
thank
ee
well
harthouse
i
hope
you
have
had
about
a
dose
of
old
bounderby
tom
said
this
with
one
eye
shut
up
again
and
looking
over
his
glass
knowingly
at
his
entertainer
a
very
good
fellow
indeed
returned
james
harthouse
you
think
so
don
t
you
said
tom
and
shut
up
his
eye
again
james
harthouse
smiled
and
rising
from
his
end
of
the
sofa
and
lounging
with
his
back
against
the
so
that
he
stood
before
the
empty
as
he
smoked
in
front
of
tom
and
looking
down
at
him
observed
what
a
comical
you
are
what
a
comical
old
bounderby
is
i
think
you
mean
said
tom
you
are
a
piece
of
caustic
tom
retorted
james
harthouse
there
was
something
so
very
agreeable
in
being
so
intimate
with
such
a
waistcoat
in
being
called
tom
in
such
an
intimate
way
by
such
a
voice
in
being
on
such
terms
so
soon
with
such
a
pair
of
whiskers
that
tom
was
uncommonly
pleased
with
himself
oh
i
don
t
care
for
old
bounderby
said
he
if
you
mean
that
i
have
always
called
old
bounderby
by
the
same
name
when
i
have
talked
about
him
and
i
have
always
thought
of
him
in
the
same
way
i
am
not
going
to
begin
to
be
polite
now
about
old
bounderby
it
would
be
rather
late
in
the
don
t
mind
me
returned
james
but
take
care
when
his
wife
is
by
you
his
wife
said
tom
my
sister
loo
o
yes
and
he
laughed
and
took
a
little
more
of
the
cooling
drink
james
harthouse
continued
to
lounge
in
the
same
place
and
attitude
smoking
his
cigar
in
his
own
easy
way
and
looking
pleasantly
at
the
whelp
as
if
he
knew
himself
to
be
a
kind
of
agreeable
demon
who
had
only
to
hover
over
him
and
he
must
give
up
his
whole
soul
if
required
it
certainly
did
seem
that
the
whelp
yielded
to
this
influence
he
looked
at
his
companion
sneakingly
he
looked
at
him
admiringly
he
looked
at
him
boldly
and
put
up
one
leg
on
the
sofa
my
sister
loo
said
tom
never
cared
for
old
that
s
the
past
tense
tom

james
harthouse
striking
the
ash
from
his

little
finger

returned
tom
good
very
quaint
said
his
friend
though
you
don
t
mean
but
i
mean
it
cried
tom
upon
my
honour
why
you
won
t
tell
me
harthouse
that
you
really
suppose
my
sister
loo
does
care
for
old
my
dear
fellow
returned
the
other
what
am
i
bound
to
suppose
when
i
find
two
married
people
living
in
harmony
and
happiness
tom
had
by
this
time
got
both
his
legs
on
the
sofa
if
his
second
leg
had
not
been
already
there
when
he
was
called
a
dear
fellow
he
would
have
put
it
up
at
that
great
stage
of
the
conversation
feeling
it
necessary
to
do
something
then
he
stretched
himself
out
at
greater
length
and
reclining
with
the
back
of
his
head
on
the
end
of
the
sofa
and
smoking
with
an
infinite
assumption
of
negligence
turned
his
common
face
and
not
too
sober
eyes
towards
the
face
looking
down
upon
him
so
carelessly
yet
so
potently
you
know
our
governor
harthouse
said
tom
and
therefore
you
needn
t
be
surprised
that
loo
married
old
bounderby
she
never
had
a
lover
and
the
governor
proposed
old
bounderby
and
she
took
very
dutiful
in
your
interesting
sister
said
james
harthouse
yes
but
she
wouldn
t
have
been
as
dutiful
and
it
would
not
have
come
off
as
easily
returned
the
whelp
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
tempter
merely
lifted
his
eyebrows
but
the
whelp
was
obliged
to
go
on
persuaded
her
he
said
with
an
edifying
air
of
superiority
i
was
stuck
into
old
bounderby
s
bank
where
i
never
wanted
to
be
and
i
knew
i
should
get
into
scrapes
there
if
she
put
old
bounderby
s
pipe
out
so
i
told
her
my
wishes
and
she
came
into
them
she
would
do
anything
for
me
it
was
very
game
of
her
wasn
t
it
it
was
charming
tom
not
that
it
was
altogether
so
important
to
her
as
it
was
to
me
continued
tom
coolly
because
my
liberty
and
comfort
and
perhaps
my
getting
on
depended
on
it
and
she
had
no
other
lover
and
staying
at
home
was
like
staying
in
when
i
was
gone
it
wasn
t
as
if
she
gave
up
another
lover
for
old
bounderby
but
still
it
was
a
good
thing
in
perfectly
delightful
and
she
gets
on
so
oh
returned
tom
with
contemptuous
patronage
she
s
a
regular
girl
a
girl
can
get
on
anywhere
she
has
settled
down
to
the
life
and
don
t
mind
it
does
just
as
well
as
another
besides
though
loo
is
a
girl
she
s
not
a
common
sort
of
girl
she
can
shut
herself
up
within
herself
and
i
have
often
known
her
sit
and
watch
the
an
hour
at
a
ay
ay
has
resources
of
her
own
said
harthouse
smoking
quietly
not
so
much
of
that
as
you
may
suppose
returned
tom
for
our
governor
had
her
crammed
with
all
sorts
of
dry
bones
and
sawdust
it
s
his
formed
his
daughter
on
his
own
model
suggested
harthouse
his
daughter
ah
and
everybody
else
why
he
formed
me
that
way
said
tom
impossible
he
did
though
said
tom
shaking
his
head
i
mean
to
say
harthouse
that
when
i
first
left
home
and
went
to
old
bounderby
s
i
was
as
flat
as
a
and
knew
no
more
about
life
than
any
oyster
come
tom
i
can
hardly
believe
that
a
joke
s
a
upon
my
soul
said
the
whelp
i
am
serious
i
am
indeed
he
smoked
with
great
gravity
and
dignity
for
a
little
while
and
then
added
in
a
highly
complacent
tone
oh
i
have
picked
up
a
little
since
i
don
t
deny
that
but
i
have
done
it
myself
no
thanks
to
the
and
your
intelligent
sister
my
intelligent
sister
is
about
where
she
was
she
used
to
complain
to
me
that
she
had
nothing
to
fall
back
upon
that
girls
usually
fall
back
upon
and
i
don
t
see
how
she
is
to
have
got
over
that
since
but
don
t
mind
he
sagaciously
added
puffing
at
his
cigar
again
girls
can
always
get
on
calling
at
the
bank
yesterday
evening
for
bounderby
s
address
i
found
an
ancient
lady
there
who
seems
to
entertain
great
admiration
for
your
sister
observed
james
harthouse
throwing
away
the
last
small
remnant
of
the
cigar
he
had
now
smoked
out
mother
sparsit
said
tom
what
you
have
seen
her
already
have
you
his
friend
nodded
tom
took
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
to
shut
up
his
eye
which
had
grown
rather
unmanageable
with
the
greater
expression
and
to
tap
his
nose
several
times
with
his
finger
mother
sparsit
s
feeling
for
loo
is
more
than
admiration
i
should
think
said
tom
say
affection
and
devotion
mother
sparsit
never
set
her
cap
at
bounderby
when
he
was
a
bachelor
oh
no
these
were
the
last
words
spoken
by
the
whelp
before
a
giddy
drowsiness
came
upon
him
followed
by
complete
oblivion
he
was
roused
from
the
latter
state
by
an
uneasy
dream
of
being
stirred
up
with
a
boot
and
also
of
a
voice
saying
come
it
s
late
be
off
well
he
said
scrambling
from
the
sofa
i
must
take
my
leave
of
you
though
i
say
yours
is
very
good
tobacco
but
it
s
too
yes
it
s
too
mild
returned
his
entertainer
it
s
ridiculously
mild
said
tom
where
s
the
door
good
night
he
had
another
odd
dream
of
being
taken
by
a
waiter
through
a
mist
which
after
giving
him
some
trouble
and
difficulty
resolved
itself
into
the
main
street
in
which
he
stood
alone
he
then
walked
home
pretty
easily
though
not
yet
free
from
an
impression
of
the
presence
and
influence
of
his
new
if
he
were
lounging
somewhere
in
the
air
in
the
same
negligent
attitude
regarding
him
with
the
same
look
the
whelp
went
home
and
went
to
bed
if
he
had
had
any
sense
of
what
he
had
done
that
night
and
had
been
less
of
a
whelp
and
more
of
a
brother
he
might
have
turned
short
on
the
road
might
have
gone
down
to
the
river
that
was
dyed
black
might
have
gone
to
bed
in
it
for
good
and
all
and
have
curtained
his
head
for
ever
with
its
filthy
waters
chapter
iv
men
and
brothers
oh
my
friends
the
operatives
of
coketown
oh
my
friends
and
the
slaves
of
an
and
a
grinding
despotism
oh
my
friends
and
and
and
i
tell
you
that
the
hour
is
come
when
we
must
rally
round
one
another
as
one
united
power
and
crumble
into
dust
the
oppressors
that
too
long
have
battened
upon
the
plunder
of
our
families
upon
the
sweat
of
our
brows
upon
the
labour
of
our
hands
upon
the
strength
of
our
sinews
upon
the
glorious
rights
of
humanity
and
upon
the
holy
and
eternal
privileges
of
brotherhood
good
hear
hear
hear
hurrah
and
other
cries
arose
in
many
voices
from
various
parts
of
the
densely
crowded
and
suffocatingly
close
hall
in
which
the
orator
perched
on
a
stage
delivered
himself
of
this
and
what
other
froth
and
fume
he
had
in
him
he
had
declaimed
himself
into
a
violent
heat
and
was
as
hoarse
as
he
was
hot
by
dint
of
roaring
at
the
top
of
his
voice
under
a
flaring
gaslight
clenching
his
fists
knitting
his
brows
setting
his
teeth
and
pounding
with
his
arms
he
had
taken
so
much
out
of
himself
by
this
time
that
he
was
brought
to
a
stop
and
called
for
a
glass
of
water
as
he
stood
there
trying
to
quench
his
fiery
face
with
his
drink
of
water
the
comparison
between
the
orator
and
the
crowd
of
attentive
faces
turned
towards
him
was
extremely
to
his
disadvantage
judging
him
by
nature
s
evidence
he
was
above
the
mass
in
very
little
but
the
stage
on
which
he
stood
in
many
great
respects
he
was
essentially
below
them
he
was
not
so
honest
he
was
not
so
manly
he
was
not
so
he
substituted
cunning
for
their
simplicity
and
passion
for
their
safe
solid
sense
an
man
with
lowering
brows
and
his
features
crushed
into
an
habitually
sour
expression
he
contrasted
most
unfavourably
even
in
his
mongrel
dress
with
the
great
body
of
his
hearers
in
their
plain
working
clothes
strange
as
it
always
is
to
consider
any
assembly
in
the
act
of
submissively
resigning
itself
to
the
dreariness
of
some
complacent
person
lord
or
commoner
whom
of
it
could
by
no
human
means
raise
out
of
the
slough
of
inanity
to
their
own
intellectual
level
it
was
particularly
strange
and
it
was
even
particularly
affecting
to
see
this
crowd
of
earnest
faces
whose
honesty
in
the
main
no
competent
observer
free
from
bias
could
doubt
so
agitated
by
such
a
leader
good
hear
hear
hurrah
the
eagerness
both
of
attention
and
intention
exhibited
in
all
the
countenances
made
them
a
most
impressive
sight
there
was
no
carelessness
no
languor
no
idle
curiosity
none
of
the
many
shades
of
indifference
to
be
seen
in
all
other
assemblies
visible
for
one
moment
there
that
every
man
felt
his
condition
to
be
somehow
or
other
worse
than
it
might
be
that
every
man
considered
it
incumbent
on
him
to
join
the
rest
towards
the
making
of
it
better
that
every
man
felt
his
only
hope
to
be
in
his
allying
himself
to
the
comrades
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
and
that
in
this
belief
right
or
wrong
unhappily
wrong
then
the
whole
of
that
crowd
were
gravely
deeply
faithfully
in
earnest
must
have
been
as
plain
to
any
one
who
chose
to
see
what
was
there
as
the
bare
beams
of
the
roof
and
the
whitened
brick
walls
nor
could
any
such
spectator
fail
to
know
in
his
own
breast
that
these
men
through
their
very
delusions
showed
great
qualities
susceptible
of
being
turned
to
the
happiest
and
best
account
and
that
to
pretend
on
the
strength
of
sweeping
axioms
howsoever
cut
and
dried
that
they
went
astray
wholly
without
cause
and
of
their
own
irrational
wills
was
to
pretend
that
there
could
be
smoke
without
fire
death
without
birth
harvest
without
seed
anything
or
everything
produced
from
nothing
the
orator
having
refreshed
himself
wiped
his
corrugated
forehead
from
left
to
right
several
times
with
his
handkerchief
folded
into
a
pad
and
concentrated
all
his
revived
forces
in
a
sneer
of
great
disdain
and
bitterness
but
oh
my
friends
and
brothers
oh
men
and
englishmen
the
operatives
of
coketown
what
shall
we
say
of
that
that
i
should
find
it
necessary
so
to
libel
the
glorious
being
practically
and
well
acquainted
with
the
grievances
and
wrongs
of
you
the
injured
pith
and
marrow
of
this
land
and
having
heard
you
with
a
noble
and
majestic
unanimity
that
will
make
tyrants
tremble
resolve
for
to
subscribe
to
the
funds
of
the
united
aggregate
tribunal
and
to
abide
by
the
injunctions
issued
by
that
body
for
your
benefit
whatever
they
may
i
ask
you
will
you
say
of
that
since
such
i
must
acknowledge
him
to
be
who
at
such
a
time
deserts
his
post
and
sells
his
flag
who
at
such
a
time
turns
a
traitor
and
a
craven
and
a
recreant
who
at
such
a
time
is
not
ashamed
to
make
to
you
the
dastardly
and
humiliating
avowal
that
he
will
hold
himself
aloof
and
will
be
one
of
those
associated
in
the
gallant
stand
for
freedom
and
for
right
the
assembly
was
divided
at
this
point
there
were
some
groans
and
hisses
but
the
general
sense
of
honour
was
much
too
strong
for
the
condemnation
of
a
man
unheard
be
sure
you
re
right
slackbridge
put
him
up
let
s
hear
him
such
things
were
said
on
many
sides
finally
one
strong
voice
called
out
is
the
man
heer
if
the
man
s
heer
slackbridge
let
s
hear
the
man
himseln
stead
o
which
was
received
with
a
round
of
applause
slackbridge
the
orator
looked
about
him
with
a
withering
smile
and
holding
out
his
right
hand
at
arm
s
length
as
the
manner
of
all
slackbridges
is
to
still
the
thundering
sea
waited
until
there
was
a
profound
silence
oh
my
friends
and
said
slackbridge
then
shaking
his
head
with
violent
scorn
i
do
not
wonder
that
you
the
prostrate
sons
of
labour
are
incredulous
of
the
existence
of
such
a
man
but
he
who
sold
his
birthright
for
a
mess
of
pottage
existed
and
judas
iscariot
existed
and
castlereagh
existed
and
this
man
exists
here
a
brief
press
and
confusion
near
the
stage
ended
in
the
man
himself
standing
at
the
orator
s
side
before
the
concourse
he
was
pale
and
a
little
moved
in
the
lips
especially
showed
it
but
he
stood
quiet
with
his
left
hand
at
his
chin
waiting
to
be
heard
there
was
a
chairman
to
regulate
the
proceedings
and
this
functionary
now
took
the
case
into
his
own
hands
my
friends
said
he
by
virtue
o
my
office
as
your
president
i
askes
o
our
friend
slackbridge
who
may
be
a
little
over
hetter
in

whiles

you
all

this
man
stephen
blackpool
you

him
awlung
o
his
misfort
ns
and
his
good
with
that
the
chairman
shook
him
frankly
by
the
hand
and
sat
down
again
slackbridge
likewise
sat
down
wiping
his
hot
from
left
to
right
and
never
the
reverse
way
my
friends
stephen
began
in
the
midst
of
a
dead
calm
i
ha

and
slackbridge
shook
his
head
as
if
he
would
shake
it
off
in
his
bitterness
i
m
th
one
single
hand
in

slackbridge
laughed
folded
his
arms
and
frowned
sarcastically
but

an
t
sommuch
for
that
as
i
stands
out
if
that
were
aw
i

coom
in

but
i
ha
my
yo
being
hindered
not
on
y
now
but
long
slackbridge
jumped
up
and
stood
beside
him
gnashing
and
tearing
oh
my
friends
what
but
this
did
i
tell
you
oh
my
what
warning
but
this
did
i
give
you
and
how
shows
this
recreant
conduct
in
a
man
on
whom
unequal
laws
are
known
to
have
fallen
heavy
oh
you
englishmen
i
ask
you
how
does
this
subornation
show
in
one
of
yourselves
who
is
thus
consenting
to
his
own
undoing
and
to
yours
and
to
your
children
s
and
your
children
s
children
s
there
was
some
applause
and
some
crying
of
shame
upon
the
man
but
the
greater
part
of
the
audience
were
quiet
they
looked
at
stephen
s
worn
face
rendered
more
pathetic
by
the
homely
emotions
it
evinced
and
in
the
kindness
of
their
nature
they
were
more
sorry
than
indignant
tis
this
delegate
s
trade
for
t
speak
said
stephen
an
he
s
paid
for
t
an
he
knows
his
work
let
him
keep
to
t
let
him
give
no
heed
to
what
i
ha
had
n
to
bear
that
s
not
for
him
that
s
not
for
nobbody
but
there
was
a
propriety
not
to
say
a
dignity
in
these
words
that
made
the
hearers
yet
more
quiet
and
attentive
the
same
strong
voice
called
out
slackbridge
let
the
man
be
heern
and
howd
thee
tongue
then
the
place
was
wonderfully
still
my
brothers
said
stephen
whose
low
voice
was
distinctly
heard
and
my
that
yo
are
to

said
the
chairman
rising
think
on
t
agen
think
on
t
once
agen
lad
afore
thou
rt
shunned
by
aw
owd
there
was
an
universal
murmur
to
the
same
effect
though
no
man
articulated
a
word
every
eye
was
fixed
on
stephen
s
face
to
repent
of
his
determination
would
be
to
take
a
load
from
all
their
minds
he
looked
around
him
and
knew
that
it
was
so
not
a
grain
of
anger
with
them
was
in
his
heart
he
knew
them
far
below
their
surface
weaknesses
and
misconceptions
as
no
one
but
their
could
i
ha
thowt
on
t
above
a
bit
sir
i
simply
canna
coom
in
i
mun
go
th
way
as
lays
afore
me
i
mun
tak
my
leave
o
aw
he
made
a
sort
of
reverence
to
them
by
holding
up
his
arms
and
stood
for
the
moment
in
that
attitude
not
speaking
until
they
slowly
dropped
at
his
sides
monny
s
the
pleasant
word
as
soom
heer
has
spok

wi

monny
s
the
face
i

as
i
first
seen
when
i
were
yoong
and

than
now
i
ha
never
had
no

none
now
that
s
o
my
makin
yo
ll
ca
me
traitor
and
i
mean
t
say
addressing
slackbridge
but
tis
easier
to
ca
than
mak
out
so
let
he
had
moved
away
a
pace
or
two
to
come
down
from
the
platform
when
he
remembered
something
he
had
not
said
and
returned
again
haply
he
said
turning
his
furrowed
face
slowly
about
that
he
might
as
it
were
individually
address
the
whole
audience
those
both
near
and
distant
haply
when
this
question
has
been
tak
n
up
and
discoosed
there
ll
be
a
threat
to
turn
out
if
i
m
let
to
work
among
yo
i
hope
i
shall
die
ere
ever
such
a
time
cooms
and
i
shall
work
solitary
among
yo
unless
it
i
mun
do

my
friends
not
to
brave
yo
but
to
live
i
ha
nobbut

and
wheerever

i

o

but
hope
i
shall
be
let
to
work
if
there
is
any
right
for
me
at
aw
my
friends
i
think
tis
not
a
word
was
spoken
not
a
sound
was
audible
in
the
building
but
the
slight
rustle
of
men
moving
a
little
apart
all
along
the
centre
of
the
room
to
open
a
means
of
passing
out
to
the
man
with
whom
they
had
all
bound
themselves
to
renounce
companionship
looking
at
no
one
and
going
his
way
with
a
lowly
steadiness
upon
him
that
asserted
nothing
and
sought
nothing
old
stephen
with
all
his
troubles
on
his
head
left
the
scene
then
slackbridge
who
had
kept
his
oratorical
arm
extended
during
the
going
out
as
if
he
were
repressing
with
infinite
solicitude
and
by
a
wonderful
moral
power
the
vehement
passions
of
the
multitude
applied
himself
to
raising
their
spirits
had
not
the
roman
brutus
oh
my
british
countrymen
condemned
his
son
to
death
and
had
not
the
spartan
mothers
oh
my
soon
to
be
victorious
friends
driven
their
flying
children
on
the
points
of
their
enemies
swords
then
was
it
not
the
sacred
duty
of
the
men
of
coketown
with
forefathers
before
them
an
admiring
world
in
company
with
them
and
a
posterity
to
come
after
them
to
hurl
out
traitors
from
the
tents
they
had
pitched
in
a
sacred
and
a
cause
the
winds
of
heaven
answered
yes
and
bore
yes
east
west
north
and
south
and
consequently
three
cheers
for
the
united
aggregate
tribunal
slackbridge
acted
as
fugleman
and
gave
the
time
the
multitude
of
doubtful
faces
a
little
brightened
at
the
sound
and
took
it
up
private
feeling
must
yield
to
the
common
cause
hurrah
the
roof
yet
vibrated
with
the
cheering
when
the
assembly
dispersed
thus
easily
did
stephen
blackpool
fall
into
the
loneliest
of
lives
the
life
of
solitude
among
a
familiar
crowd
the
stranger
in
the
land
who
looks
into
ten
thousand
faces
for
some
answering
look
and
never
finds
it
is
in
cheering
society
as
compared
with
him
who
passes
ten
averted
faces
daily
that
were
once
the
countenances
of
friends
such
experience
was
to
be
stephen
s
now
in
every
waking
moment
of
his
life
at
his
work
on
his
way
to
it
and
from
it
at
his
door
at
his
window
everywhere
by
general
consent
they
even
avoided
that
side
of
the
street
on
which
he
habitually
walked
and
left
it
of
all
the
working
men
to
him
only
he
had
been
for
many
years
a
quiet
silent
man
associating
but
little
with
other
men
and
used
to
companionship
with
his
own
thoughts
he
had
never
known
before
the
strength
of
the
want
in
his
heart
for
the
frequent
recognition
of
a
nod
a
look
a
word
or
the
immense
amount
of
relief
that
had
been
poured
into
it
by
drops
through
such
small
means
it
was
even
harder
than
he
could
have
believed
possible
to
separate
in
his
own
conscience
his
abandonment
by
all
his
fellows
from
a
baseless
sense
of
shame
and
disgrace
the
first
four
days
of
his
endurance
were
days
so
long
and
heavy
that
he
began
to
be
appalled
by
the
prospect
before
him
not
only
did
he
see
no
rachael
all
the
time
but
he
avoided
every
chance
of
seeing
her
for
although
he
knew
that
the
prohibition
did
not
yet
formally
extend
to
the
women
working
in
the
factories
he
found
that
some
of
them
with
whom
he
was
acquainted
were
changed
to
him
and
he
feared
to
try
others
and
dreaded
that
rachael
might
be
even
singled
out
from
the
rest
if
she
were
seen
in
his
company
so
he
had
been
quite
alone
during
the
four
days
and
had
spoken
to
no
one
when
as
he
was
leaving
his
work
at
night
a
young
man
of
a
very
light
complexion
accosted
him
in
the
street
your
name
s
blackpool
ain
t
it
said
the
young
man
stephen
coloured
to
find
himself
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
in
his
gratitude
for
being
spoken
to
or
in
the
suddenness
of
it
or
both
he
made
a
feint
of
adjusting
the
lining
and
said
you
are
the
hand
they
have
sent
to
coventry
i
mean
said
bitzer
the
very
light
young
man
in
question
stephen
answered
yes
again
i
supposed
so
from
their
all
appearing
to
keep
away
from
you
bounderby
wants
to
speak
to
you
you
know
his
house
don
t
you
stephen
said
yes
again
then
go
straight
up
there
will
you
said
bitzer
you
re
expected
and
have
only
to
tell
the
servant
it
s
you
i
belong
to
the
bank
so
if
you
go
straight
up
without
me
i
was
sent
to
fetch
you
you
ll
save
me
a
stephen
whose
way
had
been
in
the
contrary
direction
turned
about
and
betook
himself
as
in
duty
bound
to
the
red
brick
castle
of
the
giant
bounderby
chapter
v
men
and
masters
well
stephen
said
bounderby
in
his
windy
manner
what
s
this
i
hear
what
have
these
pests
of
the
earth
been
doing
to
come
in
and
speak
it
was
into
the
that
he
was
thus
bidden
a
was
set
out
and
bounderby
s
young
wife
and
her
brother
and
a
great
gentleman
from
london
were
present
to
whom
stephen
made
his
obeisance
closing
the
door
and
standing
near
it
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
this
is
the
man
i
was
telling
you
about
harthouse
said
bounderby
the
gentleman
he
addressed
who
was
talking
to
bounderby
on
the
sofa
got
up
saying
in
an
indolent
way
oh
really
and
dawdled
to
the
hearthrug
where
bounderby
stood
now
said
bounderby
speak
up
after
the
four
days
he
had
passed
this
address
fell
rudely
and
discordantly
on
stephen
s
ear
besides
being
a
rough
handling
of
his
wounded
mind
it
seemed
to
assume
that
he
really
was
the
deserter
he
had
been
called
what
were
it
sir
said
stephen
as
yo
were
pleased
to
want
wi
me
why
i
have
told
you
returned
bounderby
speak
up
like
a
man
since
you
are
a
man
and
tell
us
about
yourself
and
this
wi
yor
pardon
sir
said
stephen
blackpool
i
ha
nowt
to
sen
about
bounderby
who
was
always
more
or
less
like
a
wind
finding
something
in
his
way
here
began
to
blow
at
it
directly
now
look
here
harthouse
said
he
here
s
a
specimen
of
em
when
this
man
was
here
once
before
i
warned
this
man
against
the
mischievous
strangers
who
are
always
who
ought
to
be
hanged
wherever
they
are
i
told
this
man
that
he
was
going
in
the
wrong
direction
now
would
you
believe
it
that
although
they
have
put
this
mark
upon
him
he
is
such
a
slave
to
them
still
that
he
s
afraid
to
open
his
lips
about
them
i
sed
as
i
had
nowt
to
sen
sir
not
as
i
was
fearfo
o
openin
my
you
said
ah
know
what
you
said
more
than
that
i
know
what
you
mean
you
see
not
always
the
same
thing
by
the
lord
harry
quite
different
things
you
had
better
tell
us
at
once
that
that
fellow
slackbridge
is
not
in
the
town
stirring
up
the
people
to
mutiny
and
that
he
is
not
a
regular
qualified
leader
of
the
people
that
is
a
most
confounded
scoundrel
you
had
better
tell
us
so
at
once
you
can
t
deceive
me
you
want
to
tell
us
so
why
don
t
you
i
m
as
sooary
as
yo
sir
when
the
people
s
leaders
is
bad
said
stephen
shaking
his
head
they
taks
such
as
offers
haply
tis
na
the
sma
est
o
their
misfortuns
when
they
can
get
no
the
wind
began
to
get
boisterous
now
you
ll
think
this
pretty
well
harthouse
said
bounderby
you
ll
think
this
tolerably
strong
you
ll
say
upon
my
soul
this
is
a
tidy
specimen
of
what
my
friends
have
to
deal
with
but
this
is
nothing
sir
you
shall
hear
me
ask
this
man
a
question
pray
blackpool
springing
up
very
may
i
take
the
liberty
of
asking
you
how
it
happens
that
you
refused
to
be
in
this
combination
how
t
happens
ah
said
bounderby
with
his
thumbs
in
the
arms
of
his
coat
and
jerking
his
head
and
shutting
his
eyes
in
confidence
with
the
opposite
wall
how
it
i
d
leefer
not
coom
to
t
sir
but
sin
you
put
th
not

bounderby
gusty
weather
with
deceitful
calms
one
now
prevailing
o
no
sir
not
to
as
for
me
any
consideration
for
me
has
had
just
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
it
said
bounderby
still
in
confidence
with
the
wall
if
only
josiah
bounderby
of
coketown
had
been
in
question
you
would
have
joined
and
made
no
bones
about
it
why
yes
sir
tis
though
he
knows
said
bounderby
now
blowing
a
gale
that
there
are
a
set
of
rascals
and
rebels
whom
transportation
is
too
good
for
now
harthouse
you
have
been
knocking
about
in
the
world
some
time
did
you
ever
meet
with
anything
like
that
man
out
of
this
blessed
country
and
bounderby
pointed
him
out
for
inspection
with
an
angry
finger
nay
ma
am
said
stephen
blackpool
staunchly
protesting
against
the
words
that
had
been
used
and
instinctively
addressing
himself
to
louisa
after
glancing
at
her
face
not
rebels
nor
yet
rascals

o

he
spoke
with
the
rugged
earnestness
of
his
place
and
perhaps
by
a
proud
consciousness
that
he
was
faithful
to
his
class
under
all
their
mistrust
but
he
fully
remembered
where
he
was
and
did
not
even

resumed
stephen
appearing
still
to
find
his
natural
refuge
in
louisa
s
face
that
what
is
best
in

to
turn
us
most
to
trouble

my

said
bounderby
whom
he
could

exasperated
more
quite
unconscious
of

he
was

by
seeming
to
appeal
to
any
one
else
if
you
will
favour
me
with
your
attention
for
half
a
minute
i
should
like
to

a
word
or

with

you
said
just

a
gentleman
from

bounderby
made
a
backhanded
point
at
james
harthouse
with
his
thumb
a
parliament
gentleman
i
should
like
him
to
hear
a
short
bit
of
dialogue
between
you
and
me
instead
of
taking
the
substance
of

know
precious
well
beforehand
what
it
will
be
nobody

better
than
i
do
take
notice
of
receiving
it
on
trust
from
my
stephen
bent
his
head
to
the
gentleman
from
london
and
showed
a
rather
more
troubled
mind
than
usual
he
turned
his
eyes
involuntarily
to
his
former
refuge
but
at
a
look
from
that
quarter
expressive
though
instantaneous
he
settled
them
on
bounderby
s
face
now
what
do
you
complain
of
asked
bounderby
i

not

of
stephen
looked
at
him
with
some
little
irresolution
for
a
moment
and
then

to
make
up
his
mind

reverting
for
a
moment
to

former
refuge
he
observed
a
cautionary
movement
of
her
eyes
towards
the
door
stepping
back
he
put
his
hand
upon
the
lock
but
he
had
not
spoken
out
of
his
own
will
and
desire
and
he
felt
it
in
his
heart
a
noble
return
for
his
late
injurious
treatment
to
be
faithful
to
the
last
to
those
who
had
repudiated
him
he
stayed
to

stephen
stood
with
the
open
door
in
his
hand
waiting
to
know
if
anything
more
were
expected
of
him
just
stop
a
moment
said
bounderby
excessively
red
in
the
face
i
told
you
the
last
time
you
were
here
with
a
grievance
that
you
had
better
turn
about
and
come
out
of
that
and
i
also
told
you
if
you
remember
that
i
was
up
to
the
gold
spoon
i
were
not
up
to
t
myseln
sir
i
do
assure
now
it
s
clear
to
me
said
bounderby
that
you
are
one
of
those
chaps
who
have
always
got
a
grievance
and
you
go
about
sowing
it
and
raising
crops
that
s
the
business
of
life
my
stephen
shook
his
head
mutely
protesting
that
indeed
he
had
other
business
to
do
for
his
life
you
are
such
a
waspish
raspish
chap
you
see
said
bounderby
that
even
your
own
union
the
men
who
know
you
best
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
i
never
thought
those
fellows
could
be
right
in
anything
but
i
tell
you
what
i
so
far
go
along
with
them
for
a
novelty
that
ll
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
stephen
raised
his
eyes
quickly
to
his
face
you
can
finish
off
what
you
re
at
said
bounderby
with
a
meaning
nod
and
then
go
sir
yo
know
weel
said
stephen
expressively
that
if
i
canna
get
work
wi
yo
i
canna
get
it
the
reply
was
what
i
know
i
know
and
what
you
know
you
know
i
have
no
more
to
say
about
stephen
glanced
at
louisa
again
but
her
eyes
were
raised
to
his
no
more
therefore
with
a
sigh
and
saying
barely
above
his
breath
heaven
help
us
aw
in
this
world
he
departed
chapter
vi
fading
away
it
was
falling
dark
when
stephen
came
out
of
bounderby
s
house
the
shadows
of
night
had
gathered
so
fast
that
he
did
not
look
about
him
when
he
closed
the
door
but
plodded
straight
along
the
street
nothing
was
further
from
his
thoughts
than
the
curious
old
woman
he
had
encountered
on
his
previous
visit
to
the
same
house
when
he
heard
a
step
behind
him
that
he
knew
and
turning
saw
her
in
rachael
s
company
he
saw
rachael
first
as
he
had
heard
her
only
ah
rachael
my
dear
missus
thou
wi
her
well
and
now
you
are
surprised
to
be
sure
and
with
reason
i
must
say
the
old
woman
returned
here
i
am
again
you
but
how
wi
rachael
said
stephen
falling
into
their
step
walking
between
them
and
looking
from
the
one
to
the
other
why
i
come
to
be
with
this
good
lass
pretty
much
as
i
came
to
be
with
you
said
the
old
woman
cheerfully
taking
the
reply
upon
herself
my
visiting
time
is
later
this
year
than
usual
for
i
have
been
rather
troubled
with
shortness
of
breath
and
so
put
it
off
till
the
weather
was
fine
and
warm
for
the
same
reason
i
don
t
make
all
my
journey
in
one
day
but
divide
it
into
two
days
and
get
a
bed
at
the
travellers
coffee
house
down
by
the
railroad
a
nice
clean
house
and
go
back
parliamentary
at
six
in
the
morning
well
but
what
has
this
to
do
with
this
good
lass
says
you
i
m
going
to
tell
you
i
have
heard
of
bounderby
being
married
i
read
it
in
the
paper
where
it
looked
it
looked
fine
the
old
woman
dwelt
on
it
with
strange
enthusiasm
and
i
want
to
see
his
wife
i
have
never
seen
her
yet
now
if
you
ll
believe
me
she
hasn
t
come
out
of
that
house
since
noon
so
not
to
give
her
up
too
easily
i
was
waiting
about
a
little
last
bit
more
when
i
passed
close
to
this
good
lass
two
or
three
times
and
her
face
being
so
friendly
i
spoke
to
her
and
she
spoke
to
me
there
said
the
old
woman
to
stephen
you
can
make
all
the
rest
out
for
yourself
now
a
deal
shorter
than
i
can
i
dare
say
once
again
stephen
had
to
conquer
an
instinctive
propensity
to
dislike
this
old
woman
though
her
manner
was
as
honest
and
simple
as
a
manner
possibly
could
be
with
a
gentleness
that
was
as
natural
to
him
as
he
knew
it
to
be
to
rachael
he
pursued
the
subject
that
interested
her
in
her
old
age
well
missus
said
he
i
ha
seen
the
lady
and
she
were
young
and
hansom
wi
fine
dark
thinkin
eyes
and
a
still
way
rachael
as
i
ha
never
seen
the
like
young
and
handsome
yes
cried
the
old
woman
quite
delighted
as
bonny
as
a
rose
and
what
a
happy
wife
aye
missus
i
suppose
she
be
said
stephen
but
with
a
doubtful
glance
at
rachael
suppose
she
be
she
must
be
she
s
your
master
s
wife
returned
the
old
woman
stephen
nodded
assent
though
as
to
master
said
he
glancing
again
at
rachael
not
master
onny
more
that
s
aw
enden
twixt
him
and
have
you
left
his
work
stephen
asked
rachael
anxiously
and
quickly
why
rachael
he
replied
whether
i
ha
lef
n
his
work
or
whether
his
work
ha
lef
n
me
cooms
t
th
same
his
work
and
me
are
parted
tis
as
weel
i
were
thinkin
when
yo
coom
up
wi
me
it
would
ha
brought
n
trouble
upon
trouble
if
i
had
stayed
theer
haply
tis
a
kindness
to
monny
that
i
go
haply
tis
a
kindness
to
myseln
anyways
it
mun
be
done
i
mun
turn
my
face
fro
coketown
fur
th
time
and
seek
a
fort
n
dear
by
beginnin
where
will
you
go
stephen
i
donno
t
night
said
he
lifting
off
his
hat
and
smoothing
his
thin
hair
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
but
i
m
not
goin
t
night
rachael
nor
yet
t
morrow
tan
t
easy
overmuch
t
know
wheer
t
turn
but
a
good
heart
will
coom
to
herein
too
the
sense
of
even
thinking
unselfishly
aided
him
before
he
had
so
much
as
closed
bounderby
s
door
he
had
reflected
that
at
least
his
being
obliged
to
go
away
was
good
for
her
as
it
would
save
her
from
the
chance
of
being
brought
into
question
for
not
withdrawing
from
him
though
it
would
cost
him
a
hard
pang
to
leave
her
and
though
he
could
think
of
no
similar
place
in
which
his
condemnation
would
not
pursue
him
perhaps
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
be
forced
away
from
the
endurance
of
the
last
four
days
even
to
unknown
difficulties
and
distresses
so
he
said
with
truth
i
m
more
leetsome
rachael
under
t
than
i
could
n
ha
it
was
not
her
part
to
make
his
burden
heavier
she
answered
with
her
comforting
smile
and
the
three
walked
on
together
age
especially
when
it
strives
to
be
and
cheerful
finds
much
consideration
among
the
poor
the
old
woman
was
so
decent
and
contented
and
made
so
light
of
her
infirmities
though
they
had
increased
upon
her
since
her
former
interview
with
stephen
that
they
both
took
an
interest
in
her
she
was
too
sprightly
to
allow
of
their
walking
at
a
slow
pace
on
her
account
but
she
was
very
grateful
to
be
talked
to
and
very
willing
to
talk
to
any
extent
so
when
they
came
to
their
part
of
the
town
she
was
more
brisk
and
vivacious
than
ever
come
to
my
poor
place
missus
said
stephen
and
tak
a
coop
o
tea
rachael
will
coom
then
and
arterwards
i
ll
see
thee
safe
t
thy
travellers
lodgin
t
may
be
long
rachael
ere
ever
i
ha
th
chance
o
thy
coompany
they
complied
and
the
three
went
on
to
the
house
where
he
lodged
when
they
turned
into
a
narrow
street
stephen
glanced
at
his
window
with
a
dread
that
always
haunted
his
desolate
home
but
it
was
open
as
he
had
left
it
and
no
one
was
there
the
evil
spirit
of
his
life
had
flitted
away
again
months
ago
and
he
had
heard
no
more
of
her
since
the
only
evidence
of
her
last
return
now
were
the
scantier
moveables
in
his
room
and
the
grayer
hair
upon
his
head
he
lighted
a
candle
set
out
his
little
got
hot
water
from
below
and
brought
in
small
portions
of
tea
and
sugar
a
loaf
and
some
butter
from
the
nearest
shop
the
bread
was
new
and
crusty
the
butter
fresh
and
the
sugar
lump
of
fulfilment
of
the
standard
testimony
of
the
coketown
magnates
that
these
people
lived
like
princes
sir
rachael
made
the
tea
so
large
a
party
necessitated
the
borrowing
of
a
cup
and
the
visitor
enjoyed
it
mightily
it
was
the
first
glimpse
of
sociality
the
host
had
had
for
many
days
he
too
with
the
world
a
wide
heath
before
him
enjoyed
the
in
corroboration
of
the
magnates
as
exemplifying
the
utter
want
of
calculation
on
the
part
of
these
people
sir
i
ha
never
thowt
yet
missus
said
stephen
o
askin
thy
the
old
lady
announced
herself
as
mrs
a
widder
i
think
said
stephen
oh
many
long
years
pegler
s
husband
one
of
the
best
on
record
was
already
dead
by
pegler
s
calculation
when
stephen
was
born
twere
a
bad
job
too
to
lose
so
good
a
one
said
stephen
onny
children
pegler
s
cup
rattling
against
her
saucer
as
she
held
it
denoted
some
nervousness
on
her
part
no
she
said
not
now
not
dead
stephen
rachael
softly
hinted
i
m
sooary
i
ha
spok
n
on
t
said
stephen
i
ought
t
hadn
in
my
mind
as
i
might
touch
a
sore
place
blame
while
he
excused
himself
the
old
lady
s
cup
rattled
more
and
more
i
had
a
son
she
said
curiously
distressed
and
not
by
any
of
the
usual
appearances
of
sorrow
and
he
did
well
wonderfully
well
but
he
is
not
to
be
spoken
of
if
you
please
he
putting
down
her
cup
she
moved
her
hands
as
if
she
would
have
added
by
her
action
dead
then
she
said
aloud
i
have
lost
stephen
had
not
yet
got
the
better
of
his
having
given
the
old
lady
pain
when
his
landlady
came
stumbling
up
the
narrow
stairs
and
calling
him
to
the
door
whispered
in
his
ear
pegler
was
by
no
means
deaf
for
she
caught
a
word
as
it
was
uttered
bounderby
she
cried
in
a
suppressed
voice
starting
up
from
the
table
oh
hide
me
don
t
let
me
be
seen
for
the
world
don
t
let
him
come
up
till
i
ve
got
away
pray
pray
she
trembled
and
was
excessively
agitated
getting
behind
rachael
when
rachael
tried
to
reassure
her
and
not
seeming
to
know
what
she
was
about
but
hearken
missus
hearken
said
stephen
astonished
tisn
t
bounderby
tis
his
wife
yo
r
not
fearfo
o
her
yo
was
about
her
but
an
hour
but
are
you
sure
it
s
the
lady
and
not
the
gentleman
she
asked
still
trembling
certain
sure
well
then
pray
don
t
speak
to
me
nor
yet
take
any
notice
of
me
said
the
old
woman
let
me
be
quite
to
myself
in
this
stephen
nodded
looking
to
rachael
for
an
explanation
which
she
was
quite
unable
to
give
him
took
the
candle
went
downstairs
and
in
a
few
moments
returned
lighting
louisa
into
the
room
she
was
followed
by
the
whelp
rachael
had
risen
and
stood
apart
with
her
shawl
and
bonnet
in
her
hand
when
stephen
himself
profoundly
astonished
by
this
visit
put
the
candle
on
the
table
then
he
too
stood
with
his
doubled
hand
upon
the
table
near
it
waiting
to
be
addressed
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
louisa
had
come
into
one
of
the
dwellings
of
the
coketown
hands
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
face
to
face
with
anything
like
individuality
in
connection
with
them
she
knew
of
their
existence
by
hundreds
and
by
thousands
she
knew
what
results
in
work
a
given
number
of
them
would
produce
in
a
given
space
of
time
she
knew
them
in
crowds
passing
to
and
from
their
nests
like
ants
or
beetles
but
she
knew
from
her
reading
infinitely
more
of
the
ways
of
toiling
insects
than
of
these
toiling
men
and
women
something
to
be
worked
so
much
and
paid
so
much
and
there
ended
something
to
be
infallibly
settled
by
laws
of
supply
and
demand
something
that
blundered
against
those
laws
and
floundered
into
difficulty
something
that
was
a
little
pinched
when
wheat
was
dear
and
itself
when
wheat
was
cheap
something
that
increased
at
such
a
rate
of
percentage
and
yielded
such
another
percentage
of
crime
and
such
another
percentage
of
pauperism
something
wholesale
of
which
vast
fortunes
were
made
something
that
occasionally
rose
like
a
sea
and
did
some
harm
and
waste
chiefly
to
itself
and
fell
again
this
she
knew
the
coketown
hands
to
be
but
she
had
scarcely
thought
more
of
separating
them
into
units
than
of
separating
the
sea
itself
into
its
component
drops
she
stood
for
some
moments
looking
round
the
room
from
the
few
chairs
the
few
books
the
common
prints
and
the
bed
she
glanced
to
the
two
women
and
to
stephen
i
have
come
to
speak
to
you
in
consequence
of
what
passed
just
now
i
should
like
to
be
serviceable
to
you
if
you
will
let
me
is
this
your
wife
rachael
raised
her
eyes
and
they
sufficiently
answered
no
and
dropped
again
i
remember
said
louisa
reddening
at
her
mistake
i
recollect
now
to
have
heard
your
domestic
misfortunes
spoken
of
though
i
was
not
attending
to
the
particulars
at
the
time
it
was
not
my
meaning
to
ask
a
question
that
would
give
pain
to
any
one
here
if
i
should
ask
any
other
question
that
may
happen
to
have
that
result
give
me
credit
if
you
please
for
being
in
ignorance
how
to
speak
to
you
as
i
as
stephen
had
but
a
little
while
ago
instinctively
addressed
himself
to
her
so
she
now
instinctively
addressed
herself
to
rachael
her
manner
was
short
and
abrupt
yet
faltering
and
timid
he
has
told
you
what
has
passed
between
himself
and
my
husband
you
would
be
his
first
resource
i
i
have
heard
the
end
of
it
young
lady
said
rachael
did
i
understand
that
being
rejected
by
one
employer
he
would
probably
be
rejected
by
all
i
thought
he
said
as
much
the
chances
are
very
small
young
to
a
man
who
gets
a
bad
name
among
what
shall
i
understand
that
you
mean
by
a
bad
name
the
name
of
being
then
by
the
prejudices
of
his
own
class
and
by
the
prejudices
of
the
other
he
is
sacrificed
alike
are
the
two
so
deeply
separated
in
this
town
that
there
is
no
place
whatever
for
an
honest
workman
between
them
rachael
shook
her
head
in
silence
he
fell
into
suspicion
said
louisa
with
his
had
made
a
promise
not
to
be
one
of
them
i
think
it
must
have
been
to
you
that
he
made
that
promise
might
i
ask
you
why
he
made
it
rachael
burst
into
tears
i

to

me
but
i
know
he

die

hundred
deaths
ere

d
break
his
word
i
know
that
of
him
stephen
had
remained
quietly
attentive
in
his
usual
thoughtful
attitude
with
his
hand
at
his
chin
he
now
spoke
in
a
voice
rather
less
steady
than
usual
no
one
excepting
myseln
can
ever
know
what
honour
an
what
love
an
respect
i
bear
to
rachael

louisa
turned
her
head
to
him
and
bent
it
with
a
deference
that
was
new
in
her
she
looked
from
him
to
rachael
and
her
features
softened
what
will
you
do
she
asked
him
and
her
voice
had
softened
too
weel
ma

said
stephen
making
the
best
of
it
with
a
smile
when
i
ha
finished

my
kind
ledy
louisa
coloured
and
a
purse
appeared
in
her
hand
the
rustling
of
a
was
audible
as
she
unfolded
one
and
laid
it
on
the
table
rachael
will
you
tell
you

canna

that
young
lady
she
answered
turning
her
head
aside
bless
you
for
thinking
o
the
poor
lad
wi
such
tenderness
but
tis
for
him
to
know
his
heart
and
what
is
right
according
to
louisa
looked
in
part
incredulous
in
part
frightened
in
part
overcome
with
quick
sympathy
when
this
man
of
so
much
who
had
been
so
plain
and
steady
through
the
late
interview
lost
his
composure
in
a
moment
and
now
stood
with
his
hand
before
his
face
she
stretched
out
hers
as
if
she
would
have
touched
him
then
checked
herself
and
remained
still
not
e
en
rachael
said
stephen
when
he
stood
again
with
his
face
uncovered
could
mak
sitch
a
kind
offerin
by
onny
words
kinder
t
show
that
i
m
not
a
man
wi
out
reason
and
gratitude
i
ll
tak
two
pound
i
ll
borrow
t
for
t
pay
t
back
twill
be
the
sweetest
work
as
ever
i
ha
done
that
puts
it
in
my
power
t
acknowledge
once
more
my
lastin
thankfulness
for
this
present
she
was
fain
to
take
up
the
note
again
and
to
substitute
the
much
smaller
sum
he
had
named
he
was
neither
courtly
nor
handsome
nor
picturesque
in
any
respect
and
yet
his
manner
of
accepting
it
and
of
expressing
his
thanks
without
more
words
had
a
grace
in
it
that
lord
chesterfield
could
not
have
taught
his
son
in
a
century
tom
had
sat
upon
the
bed
swinging
one
leg
and
sucking
his
with
sufficient
unconcern
until
the
visit
had
attained
this
stage
seeing
his
sister
ready
to
depart
he
got
up
rather
hurriedly
and
put
in
a
word
just
wait
a
moment
loo
before
we
go
i
should
like
to
speak
to
him
a
moment
something
comes
into
my
head
if
you
ll
step
out
on
the
stairs
blackpool
i
ll
mention
it
never
mind
a
light
man
tom
was
remarkably
impatient
of
his
moving
towards
the
cupboard
to
get
one
it
don
t
want
a
stephen
followed
him
out
and
tom
closed
the
room
door
and
held
the
lock
in
his
hand
i
say
he
whispered
i
think
i
can
do
you
a
good
turn
don
t
ask
me
what
it
is
because
it
may
not
come
to
anything
but
there
s
no
harm
in
my
his
breath
fell
like
a
flame
of
fire
on
stephen
s
ear
it
was
so
hot
that
was
our
light
porter
at
the
bank
said
tom
who
brought
you
the
message
i
call
him
our
light
porter
because
i
belong
to
the
bank
stephen
thought
what
a
hurry
he
is
in
he
spoke
so
confusedly
well
said
tom
now
look
here
when
are
you
off
t
day
s
monday
replied
stephen
considering
why
sir
friday
or
saturday
nigh
friday
or
saturday
said
tom
now
look
here
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
do
you
the
good
turn
i
want
to
do
s
my
sister
you
know
in
your
i
may
be
able
to
and
if
i
should
not
be
able
to
there
s
no
harm
done
so
i
tell
you
what
you
ll
know
our
light
porter
again
yes
sure
said
stephen
very
well
returned
tom
when
you
leave
work
of
a
night
between
this
and
your
going
away
just
hang
about
the
bank
an
hour
or
so
will
you
don
t
take
on
as
if
you
meant
anything
if
he
should
see
you
hanging
about
there
because
i
shan
t
put
him
up
to
speak
to
you
unless
i
find
i
can
do
you
the
service
i
want
to
do
you
in
that
case
he
ll
have
a
note
or
a
message
for
you
but
not
else
now
look
here
you
are
sure
you
he
had
wormed
a
finger
in
the
darkness
through
a
of
stephen
s
coat
and
was
screwing
that
corner
of
the
garment
tight
up
round
and
round
in
an
extraordinary
manner
i
understand
sir
said
stephen
now
look
here
repeated
tom
be
sure
you
don
t
make
any
mistake
then
and
don
t
forget
i
shall
tell
my
sister
as
we
go
home
what
i
have
in
view
and
she
ll
approve
i
know
now
look
here
you
re
all
right
are
you
you
understand
all
about
it
very
well
then
come
along
loo
he
pushed
the
door
open
as
he
called
to
her
but
did
not
return
into
the
room
or
wait
to
be
lighted
down
the
narrow
stairs
he
was
at
the
bottom
when
she
began
to
descend
and
was
in
the
street
before
she
could
take
his
arm
pegler
remained
in
her
corner
until
the
brother
and
sister
were
gone
and
until
stephen
came
back
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
she
was
in
a
state
of
inexpressible
admiration
of
bounderby
and
like
an
unaccountable
old
woman
wept
because
she
was
such
a
pretty
yet
pegler
was
so
flurried
lest
the
object
of
her
admiration
should
return
by
chance
or
anybody
else
should
come
that
her
cheerfulness
was
ended
for
that
night
it
was
late
too
to
people
who
rose
early
and
worked
hard
therefore
the
party
broke
up
and
stephen
and
rachael
escorted
their
mysterious
acquaintance
to
the
door
of
the
travellers
coffee
house
where
they
parted
from
her
they
walked
back
together
to
the
corner
of
the
street
where
rachael
lived
and
as
they
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
it
silence
crept
upon
them
when
they
came
to
the
dark
corner
where
their
unfrequent
meetings
always
ended
they
stopped
still
silent
as
if
both
were
afraid
to
speak
i
shall
strive
t
see
thee
agen
rachael
afore
i
go
but
if
thou
wilt
not
stephen
i
know
tis
better
that
we
make

our
minds
to
be
open
wi
one
thou

bolder
and

wi
a
better
eye
bless
thee
good
night
it
was
but
a
hurried
parting
in
a
common
street
yet
it
was
a
sacred
remembrance
to
these
two
common
people
utilitarian
economists
skeletons
of
schoolmasters
commissioners
of
fact
genteel
and
infidels
gabblers
of
many
little
dog
creeds
the
poor
you
will
have
always
with
you
cultivate
in
them
while
there
is
yet
time
the
utmost
graces
of
the
fancies
and
affections
to
adorn
their
lives
so
much
in
need
of
ornament
or
in
the
day
of
your
triumph
when
romance
is
utterly
driven
out
of
their
souls
and
they
and
a
bare
existence
stand
face
to
face
reality
will
take
a
wolfish
turn
and
make
an
end
of
you
stephen
worked
the
next
day
and
the
next
uncheered
by
a
word
from
any
one
and
shunned
in
all
his
comings
and
goings
as
before
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
he
saw
land
at
the
end
of
the
third
his
loom
stood
empty
he
had
overstayed
his
hour
in
the
street
outside
the
bank
on
each
of
the
two
first
evenings
and
nothing
had
happened
there
good
or
bad
that
he
might
not
be
remiss
in
his
part
of
the
engagement
he
resolved
to
wait
full
two
hours
on
this
third
and
last
night
there
was
the
lady
who
had
once
kept
bounderby
s
house
sitting
at
the
window
as
he
had
seen
her
before
and
there
was
the
light
porter
sometimes
talking
with
her
there
and
sometimes
looking
over
the
blind
below
which
had
bank
upon
it
and
sometimes
coming
to
the
door
and
standing
on
the
steps
for
a
breath
of
air
when
he
first
came
out
stephen
thought
he
might
be
looking
for
him
and
passed
near
but
the
light
porter
only
cast
his
winking
eyes
upon
him
slightly
and
said
nothing
two
hours
were
a
long
stretch
of
lounging
about
after
a
long
day
s
labour
stephen
sat
upon
the
step
of
a
door
leaned
against
a
wall
under
an
archway
strolled
up
and
down
listened
for
the
church
clock
stopped
and
watched
children
playing
in
the
street
some
purpose
or
other
is
so
natural
to
every
one
that
a
mere
loiterer
always
looks
and
feels
remarkable
when
the
first
hour
was
out
stephen
even
began
to
have
an
uncomfortable
sensation
upon
him
of
being
for
the
time
a
disreputable
character
then
came
the
lamplighter
and
two
lengthening
lines
of
light
all
down
the
long
perspective
of
the
street
until
they
were
blended
and
lost
in
the
distance
sparsit
closed
the
window
drew
down
the
blind
and
went
presently
a
light
went
after
her
passing
first
the
fanlight
of
the
door
and
afterwards
the
two
staircase
windows
on
its
way
up
by
and
by
one
corner
of
the
blind
was
disturbed
as
if
sparsit
s
eye
were
there
also
the
other
corner
as
if
the
light
porter
s
eye
were
on
that
side
still
no
communication
was
made
to
stephen
much
relieved
when
the
two
hours
were
at
last
accomplished
he
went
away
at
a
quick
pace
as
a
recompense
for
so
much
loitering
he
had
only
to
take
leave
of
his
landlady
and
lie
down
on
his
temporary
bed
upon
the
floor
for
his
bundle
was
made
up
for
and
all
was
arranged
for
his
departure
he
meant
to
be
clear
of
the
town
very
early
before
the
hands
were
in
the
streets
it
was
barely
daybreak
when
with
a
parting
look
round
his
room
mournfully
wondering
whether
he
should
ever
see
it
again
he
went
out
the
town
was
as
entirely
deserted
as
if
the
inhabitants
had
abandoned
it
rather
than
hold
communication
with
him
everything
looked
wan
at
that
hour
even
the
coming
sun
made
but
a
pale
waste
in
the
sky
like
a
sad
sea
by
the
place
where
rachael
lived
though
it
was
not
in
his
way
by
the
red
brick
streets
by
the
great
silent
factories
not
trembling
yet
by
the
railway
where
the
were
waning
in
the
strengthening
day
by
the
railway
s
crazy
neighbourhood
half
pulled
down
and
half
built
up
by
scattered
red
brick
villas
where
the
besmoked
evergreens
were
sprinkled
with
a
dirty
powder
like
untidy
by
paths
and
many
varieties
of
ugliness
stephen
got
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
looked
back
day
was
shining
radiantly
upon
the
town
then
and
the
bells
were
going
for
the
morning
work
domestic
fires
were
not
yet
lighted
and
the
high
chimneys
had
the
sky
to
themselves
puffing
out
their
poisonous
volumes
they
would
not
be
long
in
hiding
it
but
for
half
an
hour
some
of
the
many
windows
were
golden
which
showed
the
coketown
people
a
sun
eternally
in
eclipse
through
a
medium
of
smoked
glass
so
strange
to
turn
from
the
chimneys
to
the
birds
so
strange
to
have
the
on
his
feet
instead
of
the
so
strange
to
have
lived
to
his
time
of
life
and
yet
to
be
beginning
like
a
boy
this
summer
morning
with
these
musings
in
his
mind
and
his
bundle
under
his
arm
stephen
took
his
attentive
face
along
the
high
road
and
the
trees
arched
over
him
whispering
that
he
left
a
true
and
loving
heart
behind
chapter
vii
gunpowder
james
harthouse
going
in
for
his
adopted
party
soon
began
to
score
with
the
aid
of
a
little
more
coaching
for
the
political
sages
a
little
more
genteel
listlessness
for
the
general
society
and
a
tolerable
management
of
the
assumed
honesty
in
dishonesty
most
effective
and
most
patronized
of
the
polite
deadly
sins
he
speedily
came
to
be
considered
of
much
promise
the
not
being
troubled
with
earnestness
was
a
grand
point
in
his
favour
enabling
him
to
take
to
the
hard
fact
fellows
with
as
good
a
grace
as
if
he
had
been
born
one
of
the
tribe
and
to
throw
all
other
tribes
overboard
as
conscious
hypocrites
whom
none
of
us
believe
my
dear
bounderby
and
who
do
not
believe
themselves
the
only
difference
between
us
and
the
professors
of
virtue
or
benevolence
or
mind
the
that
we
know
it
is
all
meaningless
and
say
so
while
they
know
it
equally
and
will
never
say
why
should
she
be
shocked
or
warned
by
this
reiteration
it
was
not
so
unlike
her
father
s
principles
and
her
early
training
that
it
need
startle
her
where
was
the
great
difference
between
the
two
schools
when
each
chained
her
down
to
material
realities
and
inspired
her
with
no
faith
in
anything
else
what
was
there
in
her
soul
for
james
harthouse
to
destroy
which
thomas
gradgrind
had
nurtured
there
in
its
state
of
innocence
it
was
even
the
worse
for
her
at
this
pass
that
in
her
there
before
her
eminently
practical
father
began
to
form
struggling
disposition
to
believe
in
a
wider
and
nobler
humanity
than
she
had
ever
heard
of
constantly
strove
with
doubts
and
resentments
with
doubts
because
the
aspiration
had
been
so
laid
waste
in
her
youth
with
resentments
because
of
the
wrong
that
had
been
done
her
if
it
were
indeed
a
whisper
of
the
truth
upon
a
nature
long
accustomed
to
thus
torn
and
divided
the
harthouse
philosophy
came
as
a
relief
and
justification
everything
being
hollow
and
worthless
she
had
missed
nothing
and
sacrificed
nothing
what
did
it
matter
she
had
said
to
her
father
when
he
proposed
her
husband
what
did
it
matter
she
said
still
with
a
scornful
she
asked
herself
what
did
anything
went
on
towards
what
step
by
step
onward
and
downward
towards
some
end
yet
so
gradually
that
she
believed
herself
to
remain
motionless
as
to
harthouse
whither
tended
he
neither
considered
nor
cared
he
had
no
particular
design
or
plan
before
him
no
energetic
wickedness
ruffled
his
lassitude
he
was
as
much
amused
and
interested
at
present
as
it
became
so
fine
a
gentleman
to
be
perhaps
even
more
than
it
would
have
been
consistent
with
his
reputation
to
confess
soon
after
his
arrival
he
languidly
wrote
to
his
brother
the
honourable
and
jocular
member
that
the
bounderbys
were
great
fun
and
further
that
the
female
bounderby
instead
of
being
the
gorgon
he
had
expected
was
young
and
remarkably
pretty
after
that
he
wrote
no
more
about
them
and
devoted
his
leisure
chiefly
to
their
house
he
was
very
often
in
their
house
in
his
flittings
and
visitings
about
the
coketown
district
and
was
much
encouraged
by
bounderby
it
was
quite
in
bounderby
s
gusty
way
to
boast
to
all
his
world
that
didn
t
care
about
your
highly
connected
people
but
that
if
his
wife
tom
gradgrind
s
daughter
did
she
was
welcome
to
their
company
james
harthouse
began
to
think
it
would
be
a
new
sensation
if
the
face
which
changed
so
beautifully
for
the
whelp
would
change
for
him
he
was
quick
enough
to
observe
he
had
a
good
memory
and
did
not
forget
a
word
of
the
brother
s
revelations
he
interwove
them
with
everything
he
saw
of
the
sister
and
he
began
to
understand
her
to
be
sure
the
better
and
profounder
part
of
her
character
was
not
within
his
scope
of
perception
for
in
natures
as
in
seas
depth
answers
unto
depth
but
he
soon
began
to
read
the
rest
with
a
student
s
eye
bounderby
had
taken
possession
of
a
house
and
grounds
about
fifteen
miles
from
the
town
and
accessible
within
a
mile
or
two
by
a
railway
striding
on
many
arches
over
a
wild
country
undermined
by
deserted
and
spotted
at
night
by
fires
and
black
shapes
of
stationary
engines
at
pits
mouths
this
country
gradually
softening
towards
the
neighbourhood
of
bounderby
s
retreat
there
mellowed
into
a
rustic
landscape
golden
with
heath
and
snowy
with
hawthorn
in
the
spring
of
the
year
and
tremulous
with
leaves
and
their
shadows
all
the
summer
time
the
bank
had
foreclosed
a
mortgage
effected
on
the
property
thus
pleasantly
situated
by
one
of
the
coketown
magnates
who
in
his
determination
to
make
a
shorter
cut
than
usual
to
an
enormous
fortune
overspeculated
himself
by
about
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
these
accidents
did
sometimes
happen
in
the
best
regulated
families
of
coketown
but
the
bankrupts
had
no
connexion
whatever
with
the
improvident
classes
it
afforded
bounderby
supreme
satisfaction
to
instal
himself
in
this
snug
little
estate
and
with
demonstrative
humility
to
grow
cabbages
in
the
he
delighted
to
live
among
the
elegant
furniture
and
he
bullied
the
very
pictures
with
his
origin
why
sir
he
would
say
to
a
visitor
i
am
told
that
nickits
the
late
owner
gave
seven
hundred
pound
for
that
seabeach
now
to
be
plain
with
you
if
i
ever
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
take
seven
looks
at
it
at
a
hundred
pound
a
look
it
will
be
as
much
as
i
shall
do
no
by
george
i
don
t
forget
that
i
am
josiah
bounderby
of
coketown
for
years
upon
years
the
only
pictures
in
my
possession
or
that
i
could
have
got
into
my
possession
by
any
means
unless
i
stole
em
were
the
engravings
of
a
man
shaving
himself
in
a
boot
on
the
blacking
bottles
that
i
was
overjoyed
to
use
in
cleaning
boots
with
and
that
i
sold
when
they
were
empty
for
a
farthing
and
glad
to
get
it
then
he
would
address
harthouse
in
the
same
style
harthouse
you
have
a
couple
of
horses
down
here
bring
half
a
dozen
more
if
you
like
and
we
ll
find
room
for
em
there
s
stabling
in
this
place
for
a
dozen
horses
and
unless
nickits
is
belied
he
kept
the
full
number
a
round
dozen
of
em
sir
when
that
man
was
a
boy
he
went
to
westminster
school
went
to
westminster
school
as
a
king
s
scholar
when
i
was
principally
living
on
garbage
and
sleeping
in
market
baskets
why
if
i
wanted
to
keep
a
dozen
i
don
t
for
one
s
enough
for
couldn
t
bear
to
see
em
in
their
stalls
here
and
think
what
my
own
lodging
used
to
be
i
couldn
t
look
at
em
sir
and
not
order
em
out
yet
so
things
come
round
you
see
this
place
you
know
what
sort
of
a
place
it
is
you
are
aware
that
there
s
not
a
completer
place
of
its
size
in
this
kingdom
or
don
t
care
here
got
into
the
middle
of
it
like
a
maggot
into
a
nut
is
josiah
bounderby
while
nickits
as
a
man
came
into
my
office
and
told
me
yesterday
nickits
who
used
to
act
in
latin
in
the
westminster
school
plays
with
the
and
nobility
of
this
country
applauding
him
till
they
were
black
in
the
face
is
drivelling
at
this
sir
a
fifth
floor
up
a
narrow
dark
back
street
in
it
was
among
the
leafy
shadows
of
this
retirement
in
the
long
sultry
summer
days
that
harthouse
began
to
prove
the
face
which
had
set
him
wondering
when
he
first
saw
it
and
to
try
if
it
would
change
for
him
mrs
bounderby
i
esteem
it
a
most
fortunate
accident
that
i
find
you
alone
here
i
have
for
some
time
had
a
particular
wish
to
speak
to
it
was
not
by
any
wonderful
accident
that
he
found
her
the
time
of
day
being
that
at
which
she
was
always
alone
and
the
place
being
her
favourite
resort
it
was
an
opening
in
a
dark
wood
where
some
felled
trees
lay
and
where
she
would
sit
watching
the
fallen
leaves
of
last
year
as
she
had
watched
the
falling
ashes
at
home
he
sat
down
beside
her
with
a
glance
at
her
face
your
brother
my
young
friend
her
colour
brightened
and
she
turned
to
him
with
a
look
of
interest
i
never
in
my
life
he
thought
saw
anything
so
remarkable
and
so
captivating
as
the
lighting
of
those
features
his
face
betrayed
his
without
betraying
him
for
it
might
have
been
according
to
its
instructions
so
to
do
pardon
me
the
expression
of
your
sisterly
interest
is
so
should
be
so
proud
of
know
this
is
inexcusable
but
i
am
so
compelled
to
being
so
impulsive
she
said
composedly
mrs
bounderby
no
you
know
i
make
no
pretence
with
you
you
know
i
am
a
sordid
piece
of
human
nature
ready
to
sell
myself
at
any
time
for
any
reasonable
sum
and
altogether
incapable
of
any
arcadian
proceeding
i
am
waiting
she
returned
for
your
further
reference
to
my
you
are
rigid
with
me
and
i
deserve
it
i
am
as
worthless
a
dog
as
you
will
find
except
that
i
am
not
false
but
you
surprised
and
started
me
from
my
subject
which
was
your
brother
i
have
an
interest
in
have
you
an
interest
in
anything
harthouse
she
asked
half
incredulously
and
half
gratefully
if
you
had
asked
me
when
i
first
came
here
i
should
have
said
no
i
must
say
at
the
hazard
of
appearing
to
make
a
pretence
and
of
justly
awakening
your
she
made
a
slight
movement
as
if
she
were
trying
to
speak
but
could
not
find
voice
at
length
she
said
mr
harthouse
i
give
you
credit
for
being
interested
in
my
thank
you
i
claim
to
deserve
it
you
know
how
little
i
do
claim
but
i
will
go
that
length
you
have
done
so
much
for
him
you
are
so
fond
of
him
your
whole
life
bounderby
expresses
such
charming
on
his
me
am
running
wide
of
the
subject
i
am
interested
in
him
for
his
own
she
had
made
the
slightest
action
possible
as
if
she
would
have
risen
in
a
hurry
and
gone
away
he
had
turned
the
course
of
what
he
said
at
that
instant
and
she
remained
mrs
bounderby
he
resumed
in
a
lighter
manner
and
yet
with
a
show
of
effort
in
assuming
it
which
was
even
more
expressive
than
the
manner
he
dismissed
it
is
no
irrevocable
offence
in
a
young
fellow
of
your
brother
s
years
if
he
is
heedless
inconsiderate
and
little
dissipated
in
the
common
phrase
is
he
allow
me
to
be
frank
do
you
think
he
games
at
all
i
think
he
makes
harthouse
waiting
as
if
that
were
not
her
whole
answer
she
added
i
know
he
of
course
he
loses
everybody
does
lose
who
bets
may
i
hint
at
the
probability
of
your
sometimes
supplying
him
with
money
for
these
purposes
she
sat
looking
down
but
at
this
question
raised
her
eyes
searchingly
and
a
little
resentfully
acquit
me
of
impertinent
curiosity
my
dear
bounderby
i
think
tom
may
be
gradually
falling
into
trouble
and
i
wish
to
stretch
out
a
helping
hand
to
him
from
the
depths
of
my
wicked
i
say
again
for
his
sake
is
that
necessary
she
seemed
to
try
to
answer
but
nothing
came
of
it
candidly
to
confess
everything
that
has
occurred
to
me
said
james
harthouse
again
gliding
with
the
same
appearance
of
effort
into
his
more
airy
manner
i
will
confide
to
you
my
doubt
whether
he
has
had
many
advantages
my
any
great
amount
of
confidence
is
likely
to
have
been
established
between
himself
and
his
most
worthy
i
do
not
said
louisa
flushing
with
her
own
great
remembrance
in
that
wise
think
it
or
between
himself
may
trust
to
your
perfect
understanding
of
my
meaning
i
am
his
highly
esteemed
she
flushed
deeper
and
deeper
and
was
burning
red
when
she
replied
in
a
fainter
voice
i
do
not
think
that
likely
mrs
bounderby
said
harthouse
after
a
short
silence
may
there
be
a
better
confidence
between
yourself
and
me
tom
has
borrowed
a
considerable
sum
of
you
you
will
understand
harthouse
she
returned
after
some
indecision
she
had
been
more
or
less
uncertain
and
troubled
throughout
the
conversation
and
yet
had
in
the
main
preserved
her
manner
you
will
understand
that
if
i
tell
you
what
you
press
to
know
it
is
not
by
way
of
complaint
or
regret
i
would
never
complain
of
anything
and
what
i
have
done
i
do
not
in
the
least
so
spirited
too
thought
james
harthouse
when
i
married
i
found
that
my
brother
was
even
at
that
time
heavily
in
debt
heavily
for
him
i
mean
heavily
enough
to
oblige
me
to
sell
some
trinkets
they
were
no
sacrifice
i
sold
them
very
willingly
i
attached
no
value
to
them
they
were
quite
worthless
to
either
she
saw
in
his
face
that
he
knew
or
she
only
feared
in
her
conscience
that
he
knew
that
she
spoke
of
some
of
her
husband
s
gifts
she
stopped
and
reddened
again
if
he
had
not
known
it
before
he
would
have
known
it
then
though
he
had
been
a
much
duller
man
than
he
was
since
then
i
have
given
my
brother
at
various
times
what
money
i
could
spare
in
short
what
money
i
have
had
confiding
in
you
at
all
on
the
faith
of
the
interest
you
profess
for
him
i
will
not
do
so
by
halves
since
you
have
been
in
the
habit
of
visiting
here
he
has
wanted
in
one
sum
as
much
as
a
hundred
pounds
i
have
not
been
able
to
give
it
to
him
i
have
felt
uneasy
for
the
consequences
of
his
being
so
involved
but
i
have
kept
these
secrets
until
now
when
i
trust
them
to
your
honour
i
have
held
no
confidence
with
any
one
anticipated
my
reason
just
she
abruptly
broke
off
he
was
a
ready
man
and
he
saw
and
seized
an
opportunity
here
of
presenting
her
own
image
to
her
slightly
disguised
as
her
brother
mrs
bounderby
though
a
graceless
person
of
the
world
worldly
i
feel
the
utmost
interest
i
assure
you
in
what
you
tell
me
i
can
not
possibly
be
hard
upon
your
brother
i
understand
and
share
the
wise
consideration
with
which
you
regard
his
errors
with
all
possible
respect
both
for
gradgrind
and
for
bounderby
i
think
i
perceive
that
he
has
not
been
fortunate
in
his
training
bred
at
a
disadvantage
towards
the
society
in
which
he
has
his
part
to
play
he
rushes
into
these
extremes
for
himself
from
opposite
extremes
that
have
long
been
the
very
best
intentions
we
have
no
him
bounderby
s
fine
bluff
english
independence
though
a
most
charming
characteristic
does
we
have
confidence
if
i
might
venture
to
remark
that
it
is
the
least
in
the
world
deficient
in
that
delicacy
to
which
a
youth
mistaken
a
character
misconceived
and
abilities
misdirected
would
turn
for
relief
and
guidance
i
should
express
what
it
presents
to
my
own
as
she
sat
looking
straight
before
her
across
the
changing
lights
upon
the
grass
into
the
darkness
of
the
wood
beyond
he
saw
in
her
face
her
application
of
his
very
distinctly
uttered
words
all
allowance
he
continued
must
be
made
i
have
one
great
fault
to
find
with
tom
however
which
i
can
not
forgive
and
for
which
i
take
him
heavily
to
louisa
turned
her
eyes
to
his
face
and
asked
him
what
fault
was
that
perhaps
he
returned
i
have
said
enough
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
on
the
whole
if
no
allusion
to
it
had
escaped
you
alarm
me
harthouse
pray
let
me
know
to
relieve
you
from
needless
as
this
confidence
regarding
your
brother
which
i
prize
i
am
sure
above
all
possible
things
has
been
established
between
obey
i
can
not
forgive
him
for
not
being
more
sensible
in
every
word
look
and
act
of
his
life
of
the
affection
of
his
best
friend
of
the
devotion
of
his
best
friend
of
her
unselfishness
of
her
sacrifice
the
return
he
makes
her
within
my
observation
is
a
very
poor
one
what
she
has
done
for
him
demands
his
constant
love
and
gratitude
not
his
and
caprice
careless
fellow
as
i
am
i
am
not
so
indifferent
bounderby
as
to
be
regardless
of
this
vice
in
your
brother
or
inclined
to
consider
it
a
venial
the
wood
floated
before
her
for
her
eyes
were
suffused
with
tears
they
rose
from
a
deep
well
long
concealed
and
her
heart
was
filled
with
acute
pain
that
found
no
relief
in
them
in
a
word
it
is
to
correct
your
brother
in
this
bounderby
that
i
must
aspire
my
better
knowledge
of
his
circumstances
and
my
direction
and
advice
in
extricating
valuable
i
hope
as
coming
from
a
scapegrace
on
a
much
larger
give
me
some
influence
over
him
and
all
i
gain
i
shall
certainly
use
towards
this
end
i
have
said
enough
and
more
than
enough
i
seem
to
be
protesting
that
i
am
a
sort
of
good
fellow
when
upon
my
honour
i
have
not
the
least
intention
to
make
any
protestation
to
that
effect
and
openly
announce
that
i
am
nothing
of
the
sort
yonder
among
the
trees
he
added
having
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
looked
about
for
he
had
watched
her
closely
until
now
is
your
brother
himself
no
doubt
just
come
down
as
he
seems
to
be
loitering
in
this
direction
it
may
be
as
well
perhaps
to
walk
towards
him
and
throw
ourselves
in
his
way
he
has
been
very
silent
and
doleful
of
late
perhaps
his
brotherly
conscience
is
there
are
such
things
as
consciences
though
upon
my
honour
i
hear
of
them
much
too
often
to
believe
in
he
assisted
her
to
rise
and
she
took
his
arm
and
they
advanced
to
meet
the
whelp
he
was
idly
beating
the
branches
as
he
lounged
along
or
he
stooped
viciously
to
rip
the
moss
from
the
trees
with
his
stick
he
was
startled
when
they
came
upon
him
while
he
was
engaged
in
this
latter
pastime
and
his
colour
changed
halloa
he
stammered
i
didn
t
know
you
were
whose
name
tom
said
harthouse
putting
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
turning
him
so
that
they
all
three
walked
towards
the
house
together
have
you
been
carving
on
the
trees
whose
name
returned
tom
oh
you
mean
what
girl
s
name
you
have
a
suspicious
appearance
of
inscribing
some
fair
creature
s
on
the
bark
picture
harthouse
and
tom
gradgrind
in
the
garden
not
much
of
that
harthouse
unless
some
fair
creature
with
a
slashing
fortune
at
her
own
disposal
would
take
a
fancy
to
me
or
she
might
be
as
ugly
as
she
was
rich
without
any
fear
of
losing
me
i
d
carve
her
name
as
often
as
she
i
am
afraid
you
are
mercenary
mercenary
repeated
tom
who
is
not
mercenary
ask
my
have
you
so
proved
it
to
be
a
failing
of
mine
tom
said
louisa
showing
no
other
sense
of
his
discontent
and
you
know
whether
the
cap
fits
you
loo
returned
her
brother
sulkily
if
it
does
you
can
wear
tom
is
misanthropical
as
all
bored
people
are
now
and
then
said
harthouse
don
t
believe
him
bounderby
he
knows
much
better
i
shall
disclose
some
of
his
opinions
of
you
privately
expressed
to
me
unless
he
relents
a
at
all
events
harthouse
said
tom
softening
in
his
admiration
of
his
patron
but
shaking
his
head
sullenly
too
you
can
t
tell
her
that
i
ever
praised
her
for
being
mercenary
i
may
have
praised
her
for
being
the
contrary
and
i
should
do
it
again
if
i
had
as
good
reason
however
never
mind
this
now
it
s
not
very
interesting
to
you
and
i
am
sick
of
the
they
walked
on
to
the
house
where
louisa
quitted
her
visitor
s
arm
and
went
in
he
stood
looking
after
her
as
she
ascended
the
steps
and
passed
into
the
shadow
of
the
door
then
put
his
hand
upon
her
brother
s
shoulder
again
and
invited
him
with
a
confidential
nod
to
a
walk
in
the
garden
tom
my
fine
fellow
i
want
to
have
a
word
with
they
had
stopped
among
a
disorder
of
was
part
of
bounderby
s
humility
to
keep
nickits
s
roses
on
a
reduced
tom
sat
down
on
a
plucking
buds
and
picking
them
to
pieces
while
his
powerful
familiar
stood
over
him
with
a
foot
upon
the
parapet
and
his
figure
easily
resting
on
the
arm
supported
by
that
knee
they
were
just
visible
from
her
window
perhaps
she
saw
them
tom
what
s
the
matter
oh
harthouse
said
tom
with
a
groan
i
am
hard
up
and
bothered
out
of
my
my
good
fellow
so
am
you
returned
tom
you
are
the
picture
of
independence
harthouse
i
am
in
a
horrible
mess
you
have
no
idea
what
a
state
i
have
got
myself
a
state
my
sister
might
have
got
me
out
of
if
she
would
only
have
done
he
took
to
biting
the
rosebuds
now
and
tearing
them
away
from
his
teeth
with
a
hand
that
trembled
like
an
infirm
old
man
s
after
one
exceedingly
observant
look
at
him
his
companion
relapsed
into
his
lightest
air
tom
you
are
inconsiderate
you
expect
too
much
of
your
sister
you
have
had
money
of
her
you
dog
you
know
you
well
harthouse
i
know
i
have
how
else
was
i
to
get
it
here
s
old
bounderby
always
boasting
that
at
my
age
he
lived
upon
twopence
a
month
or
something
of
that
sort
here
s
my
father
drawing
what
he
calls
a
line
and
tying
me
down
to
it
from
a
baby
neck
and
heels
here
s
my
mother
who
never
has
anything
of
her
own
except
her
complaints
what
a
fellow
to
do
for
money
and
where
i
to
look
for
it
if
not
to
my
sister
he
was
almost
crying
and
scattered
the
buds
about
by
dozens
harthouse
took
him
persuasively
by
the
coat
but
my
dear
tom
if
your
sister
has
not
got
not
got
it
harthouse
i
don
t
say
she
has
got
it
i
may
have
wanted
more
than
she
was
likely
to
have
got
but
then
she
ought
to
get
it
she
could
get
it
it
s
of
no
use
pretending
to
make
a
secret
of
matters
now
after
what
i
have
told
you
already
you
know
she
didn
t
marry
old
bounderby
for
her
own
sake
or
for
his
sake
but
for
my
sake
then
why
doesn
t
she
get
what
i
want
out
of
him
for
my
sake
she
is
not
obliged
to
say
what
she
is
going
to
do
with
it
she
is
sharp
enough
she
could
manage
to
coax
it
out
of
him
if
she
chose
then
why
doesn
t
she
choose
when
i
tell
her
of
what
consequence
it
is
but
no
there
she
sits
in
his
company
like
a
stone
instead
of
making
herself
agreeable
and
getting
it
easily
i
don
t
know
what
you
may
call
this
but
i
call
it
unnatural
there
was
a
piece
of
ornamental
water
immediately
below
the
parapet
on
the
other
side
into
which
james
harthouse
had
a
very
strong
inclination
to
pitch
thomas
gradgrind
junior
as
the
injured
men
of
coketown
threatened
to
pitch
their
property
into
the
atlantic
but
he
preserved
his
easy
attitude
and
nothing
more
solid
went
over
the
stone
balustrades
than
the
accumulated
rosebuds
now
floating
about
a
little
my
dear
tom
said
harthouse
let
me
try
to
be
your
for
god
s
sake
replied
tom
suddenly
don
t
talk
about
bankers
and
very
white
he
looked
in
contrast
with
the
roses
very
white
harthouse
as
a
thoroughly
man
accustomed
to
the
best
society
was
not
to
be
could
as
soon
have
been
he
raised
his
eyelids
a
little
more
as
if
they
were
lifted
by
a
feeble
touch
of
wonder
albeit
it
was
as
much
against
the
precepts
of
his
school
to
wonder
as
it
was
against
the
doctrines
of
the
gradgrind
college
what
is
the
present
need
tom
three
figures
out
with
them
say
what
they
mr
harthouse
returned
tom
now
actually
crying
and
his
tears
were
better
than
his
injuries
however
pitiful
a
figure
he
made
it
s
too
late
the
money
is
of
no
use
to
me
at
present
i
should
have
had
it
before
to
be
of
use
to
me
but
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
you
re
a
true
a
true
friend
whelp
whelp
thought
harthouse
lazily
what
an
ass
you
are
and
i
take
your
offer
as
a
great
kindness
said
tom
grasping
his
hand
as
a
great
kindness
well
returned
the
other
it
may
be
of
more
use
by
and
by
and
my
good
fellow
if
you
will
open
your
bedevilments
to
me
when
they
come
thick
upon
you
i
may
show
you
better
ways
out
of
them
than
you
can
find
for
thank
you
said
tom
shaking
his
head
dismally
and
chewing
rosebuds
i
wish
i
had
known
you
sooner
now
you
see
tom
said
harthouse
in
conclusion
himself
tossing
over
a
rose
or
two
as
a
contribution
to
the
island
which
was
always
drifting
to
the
wall
as
if
it
wanted
to
become
a
part
of
the
mainland
every
man
is
selfish
in
everything
he
does
and
i
am
exactly
like
the
rest
of
my
i
am
desperately
intent
the
languor
of
his
desperation
being
quite
tropical
on
your
softening
towards
your
you
ought
to
do
and
on
your
being
a
more
loving
and
agreeable
sort
of
you
ought
to
i
will
be
no
time
like
the
present
tom
begin
at
certainly
i
will
and
my
sister
loo
shall
say
having
made
which
bargain
tom
said
harthouse
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
again
with
an
air
which
left
him
at
liberty
to
he
did
poor
this
condition
was
imposed
upon
him
in
mere
careless
good
nature
to
lessen
his
sense
of
obligation
we
will
tear
ourselves
asunder
until
when
tom
appeared
before
dinner
though
his
mind
seemed
heavy
enough
his
body
was
on
the
alert
and
he
appeared
before
bounderby
came
in
i
didn
t
mean
to
be
cross
loo
he
said
giving
her
his
hand
and
kissing
her
i
know
you
are
fond
of
me
and
you
know
i
am
fond
of
after
this
there
was
a
smile
upon
louisa
s
face
that
day
for
some
one
else
alas
for
some
one
else
so
much
the
less
is
the
whelp
the
only
creature
that
she
cares
for
thought
james
harthouse
reversing
the
reflection
of
his
first
day
s
knowledge
of
her
pretty
face
so
much
the
less
so
much
the
chapter
viii
explosion
the
next
morning
was
too
bright
a
morning
for
sleep
and
james
harthouse
rose
early
and
sat
in
the
pleasant
bay
window
of
his
smoking
the
rare
tobacco
that
had
had
so
wholesome
an
influence
on
his
young
friend
reposing
in
the
sunlight
with
the
fragrance
of
his
eastern
pipe
about
him
and
the
dreamy
smoke
vanishing
into
the
air
so
rich
and
soft
with
summer
odours
he
reckoned
up
his
advantages
as
an
idle
winner
might
count
his
gains
he
was
not
at
all
bored
for
the
time
and
could
give
his
mind
to
it
he
had
established
a
confidence
with
her
from
which
her
husband
was
excluded
he
had
established
a
confidence
with
her
that
absolutely
turned
upon
her
indifference
towards
her
husband
and
the
absence
now
and
at
all
times
of
any
congeniality
between
them
he
had
artfully
but
plainly
assured
her
that
he
knew
her
heart
in
its
last
most
delicate
recesses
he
had
come
so
near
to
her
through
its
tenderest
sentiment
he
had
associated
himself
with
that
feeling
and
the
barrier
behind
which
she
lived
had
melted
away
all
very
odd
and
very
satisfactory
and
yet
he
had
not
even
now
any
earnest
wickedness
of
purpose
in
him
publicly
and
privately
it
were
much
better
for
the
age
in
which
he
lived
that
he
and
the
legion
of
whom
he
was
one
were
designedly
bad
than
indifferent
and
purposeless
it
is
the
drifting
icebergs
setting
with
any
current
anywhere
that
wreck
the
ships
when
the
devil
goeth
about
like
a
roaring
lion
he
goeth
about
in
a
shape
by
which
few
but
savages
and
hunters
are
attracted
but
when
he
is
trimmed
smoothed
and
varnished
according
to
the
mode
when
he
is
aweary
of
vice
and
aweary
of
virtue
used
up
as
to
brimstone
and
used
up
as
to
bliss
then
whether
he
take
to
the
serving
out
of
red
tape
or
to
the
kindling
of
red
fire
he
is
the
very
devil
so
james
harthouse
reclined
in
the
window
indolently
smoking
and
reckoning
up
the
steps
he
had
taken
on
the
road
by
which
he
happened
to
be
travelling
the
end
to
which
it
led
was
before
him
pretty
plainly
but
he
troubled
himself
with
no
calculations
about
it
what
will
be
will
be
as
he
had
rather
a
long
ride
to
take
that
there
was
a
public
occasion
to
do
at
some
distance
which
afforded
a
tolerable
opportunity
of
going
in
for
the
gradgrind
dressed
early
and
went
down
to
breakfast
he
was
anxious
to
see
if
she
had
relapsed
since
the
previous
evening
no
he
resumed
where
he
had
left
off
there
was
a
look
of
interest
for
him
again
he
got
through
the
day
as
much
or
as
little
to
his
own
satisfaction
as
was
to
be
expected
under
the
fatiguing
circumstances
and
came
riding
back
at
six
o
clock
there
was
a
sweep
of
some
between
the
lodge
and
the
house
and
he
was
riding
along
at
a
foot
pace
over
the
smooth
gravel
once
nickits
s
when
bounderby
burst
out
of
the
shrubbery
with
such
violence
as
to
make
his
horse
shy
across
the
road
harthouse
cried
bounderby
have
you
heard
heard
what
said
harthouse
soothing
his
horse
and
inwardly
favouring
bounderby
with
no
good
wishes
then
you
heard
i
have
heard
you
and
so
has
this
brute
i
have
heard
nothing
bounderby
red
and
hot
planted
himself
in
the
centre
of
the
path
before
the
horse
s
head
to
explode
his
bombshell
with
more
effect
the
bank
s
robbed
you
don
t
mean
it
robbed
last
night
sir
robbed
in
an
extraordinary
manner
robbed
with
a
false
of
much
bounderby
in
his
desire
to
make
the
most
of
it
really
seemed
mortified
by
being
obliged
to
reply
why
no
not
of
very
much
but
it
might
have
of
how
much
oh
as
a
you
stick
to
a
not
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
pound
said
bounderby
with
impatience
but
it
s
not
the
sum
it
s
the
fact
it
s
the
fact
of
the
bank
being
robbed
that
s
the
important
circumstance
i
am
surprised
you
don
t
see
my
dear
bounderby
said
james
dismounting
and
giving
his
bridle
to
his
servant
i
see
it
and
am
as
overcome
as
you
can
possibly
desire
me
to
be
by
the
spectacle
afforded
to
my
mental
view
nevertheless
i
may
be
allowed
i
hope
to
congratulate
i
do
with
all
my
soul
i
assure
your
not
having
sustained
a
greater
thank
ee
replied
bounderby
in
a
short
ungracious
manner
but
i
tell
you
what
it
might
have
been
twenty
thousand
i
suppose
it
suppose
it
might
by
the
lord
you
suppose
so
by
george
said
bounderby
with
sundry
menacing
nods
and
shakes
of
his
head
it
might
have
been
twice
twenty
there
s
no
knowing
what
it
would
have
been
or
wouldn
t
have
been
as
it
was
but
for
the
fellows
being
louisa
had
come
up
now
and
sparsit
and
bitzer
here
s
tom
gradgrind
s
daughter
knows
pretty
well
what
it
might
have
been
if
you
don
t
blustered
bounderby
dropped
sir
as
if
she
was
shot
when
i
told
her
never
knew
her
do
such
a
thing
before
does
her
credit
under
the
circumstances
in
my
opinion
she
still
looked
faint
and
pale
james
harthouse
begged
her
to
take
his
arm
and
as
they
moved
on
very
slowly
asked
her
how
the
robbery
had
been
committed
why
i
am
going
to
tell
you
said
bounderby
irritably
giving
his
arm
to
sparsit
if
you
hadn
t
been
so
mighty
particular
about
the
sum
i
should
have
begun
to
tell
you
before
you
know
this
lady
for
she
a
lady
sparsit
i
have
already
had
the
very
well
and
this
young
man
bitzer
you
saw
him
too
on
the
same
occasion
harthouse
inclined
his
head
in
assent
and
bitzer
knuckled
his
forehead
very
well
they
live
at
the
bank
you
know
they
live
at
the
bank
perhaps
very
well
yesterday
afternoon
at
the
close
of
business
hours
everything
was
put
away
as
usual
in
the
iron
room
that
this
young
fellow
sleeps
outside
of
there
was
never
mind
how
much
in
the
little
safe
in
young
tom
s
closet
the
safe
used
for
petty
purposes
there
was
a
hundred
and
fifty
odd
a
hundred
and
seven
one
said
bitzer
come
retorted
bounderby
stopping
to
wheel
round
upon
him
let
s
have
none
of
interruptions
it
s
enough
to
be
robbed
while
you
re
snoring
because
you
re
too
comfortable
without
being
put
right
with
four
seven
ones
i
didn
t
snore
myself
when
i
was
your
age
let
me
tell
you
i
hadn
t
victuals
enough
to
snore
and
i
didn
t
four
seven
one
not
if
i
knew
bitzer
knuckled
his
forehead
again
in
a
sneaking
manner
and
seemed
at
once
particularly
impressed
and
depressed
by
the
instance
last
given
of
bounderby
s
moral
abstinence
a
hundred
and
fifty
odd
pound
resumed
bounderby
that
sum
of
money
young
tom
locked
in
his
safe
not
a
very
strong
safe
but
that
s
no
matter
now
everything
was
left
all
right
some
time
in
the
night
while
this
young
fellow
sparsit
ma
am
you
say
you
have
heard
him
snore
sir
returned
sparsit
i
can
not
say
that
i
have
heard
him
precisely
snore
and
therefore
must
not
make
that
statement
but
on
winter
evenings
when
he
has
fallen
asleep
at
his
table
i
have
heard
him
what
i
should
prefer
to
describe
as
partially
choke
i
have
heard
him
on
such
occasions
produce
sounds
of
a
nature
similar
to
what
may
be
sometimes
heard
in
dutch
clocks
not
said
sparsit
with
a
lofty
sense
of
giving
strict
evidence
that
i
would
convey
any
imputation
on
his
moral
character
far
from
it
i
have
always
considered
bitzer
a
young
man
of
the
most
upright
principle
and
to
that
i
beg
to
bear
my
well

the
exasperated
bounderby

was
snoring

and
abstracted

then
disturbed
they
made
off
letting
themselves
out
at
the
main
door
and
it
again
it
was
and
the
key
under
sparsit
s
pillow
with
a
false
key
which
was
picked
up
in
the
street
near
the
bank
about
twelve
o
clock
no
alarm
takes
place
till
this
chap
bitzer
turns
out
this
morning
and
begins
to
open
and
prepare
the
offices
for
business
then
looking
at
tom
s
safe
he
sees
the
door
ajar
and
finds
the
lock
forced
and
the
money
where
is
tom

the

asked
harthouse
glancing
round
he
has
been
helping
the
police
said
bounderby
and
stays
behind
at
the
bank
i
wish
these
fellows
had
tried
to
rob
me
when
i
was
at
his
time
of
life
they
would
have
been
out
of
pocket
if
they
had
invested
eighteenpence
in
the
job
i
can
tell
em
is
anybody
suspected
suspected
i
should
think
there
was
somebody
suspected

bounderby
relinquishing
sparsit
s
arm
to
wipe
his
heated
head
josiah
bounderby
of
coketown
is
not
to
be
plundered
and
nobody
suspected
no
thank
you
might
harthouse
inquire
who
was
suspected
well
said
bounderby
stopping
and
facing
about
to
confront
them
all
i
ll
tell
you
it
s
not
to
be
mentioned
everywhere
it
s
not
to
be
mentioned
anywhere
in
order
that
the
scoundrels
concerned
there
s
a
gang
of
em
may
be
thrown
off
their
guard
so
take
this
in
confidence
now
wait
a
bounderby
wiped
his
head
again
what
should
you
say
to
here
he
violently
exploded
to
a
hand
being
in
it
i
hope
said
harthouse
lazily
not
our
friend
blackpot
say
pool
instead
of
pot
sir
returned
bounderby
and
that
s
the
louisa
faintly
uttered
some
word
of
incredulity
and
surprise
o
yes
i
know
said
bounderby
immediately
catching
at
the
sound
i
know
i
am
used
to
that
i
know
all
about
it
they
are
the
finest
people
in
the
world
these
fellows
are
they
have
got
the
gift
of
the
gab
they
have
they
only
want
to
have
their
rights
explained
to
them
they
do
but
i
tell
you
what
show
me
a
dissatisfied
hand
and
i
ll
show
you
a
man
that
s
fit
for
anything
bad
i
don
t
care
what
it
another
of
the
popular
fictions
of
coketown
which
some
pains
had
been
taken
to
which
some
people
really
believed
but
i
am
acquainted
with
these
chaps
said
bounderby
i
can
read
em
off
like
books
sparsit
ma
am
i
appeal
to
you
what
warning
did
i
give
that
fellow
the
first
time
he
set
foot
in
the
house
when
the
express
object
of
his
visit
was
to
know
how
he
could
knock
religion
over
and
floor
the
established
church
sparsit
in
point
of
high
connexions
you
are
on
a
level
with
the
aristocracy
i
say
or
did
i
not
say
to
that
fellow
you
can
t
hide
the
truth
from
me
you
are
not
the
kind
of
fellow
i
like
you
ll
come
to
no
good
assuredly
sir
returned
sparsit
you
did
in
a
highly
impressive
manner
give
him
such
an
when
he
shocked
you
ma
am
said
bounderby
when
he
shocked
your
feelings
yes
sir
returned
sparsit
with
a
meek
shake
of
her
head
he
certainly
did
so
though
i
do
not
mean
to
say
but
that
my
feelings
may
be
weaker
on
such
foolish
if
the
term
is
they
might
have
been
if
i
had
always
occupied
my
present
bounderby
stared
with
a
bursting
pride
at
harthouse
as
much
as
to
say
i
am
the
proprietor
of
this
female
and
she
s
worth
your
attention
i
then
resumed
his
discourse
you
can
recall
for
yourself
harthouse
what
i
said
to
him
when
you
saw
him
i
didn
t
mince
the
matter
with
him
i
am
never
mealy
with
em
i
know
em
very
well
sir
three
days
after
that
he
bolted
went
off
nobody
knows
where
as
my
mother
did
in
my
with
this
difference
that
he
is
a
worse
subject
than
my
mother
if
possible
what
did
he
do
before
he
went
what
do
you
say
bounderby
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
gave
a
beat
upon
the
crown
at
every
little
division
of
his
sentences
as
if
it
were
a
tambourine
to
his
being
after
the
bank
his
lurking
about
dark
its
striking
he
could
be
lurking
for
no
her
calling
bitzer
s
attention
to
him
and
their
both
taking
notice
of
to
its
appearing
on
inquiry
he
was
also
noticed
by
the
neighbours
having
come
to
the
climax
bounderby
like
an
oriental
dancer
put
his
tambourine
on
his
head
suspicious
said
james
harthouse
i
think
so
sir
said
bounderby
with
a
defiant
nod
i
think
so
but
there
are
more
of
em
in
it
there
s
an
old
woman
one
never
hears
of
these
things
till
the
mischief
s
done
all
sorts
of
defects
are
found
out
in
the
stable
door
after
the
horse
is
stolen
there
s
an
old
woman
turns
up
now
an
old
woman
who
seems
to
have
been
flying
into
town
on
a
broomstick
every
now
and
then
watches
the
place
a
whole
day
before
this
fellow
begins
and
on
the
night
when
you
saw
him
she
steals
away
with
him
and
holds
a
council
with
suppose
to
make
her
report
on
going
off
duty
and
be
damned
to
there
was
such
a
person
in
the
room
that
night
and
she
shrunk
from
observation
thought
louisa
this
is
not
all
of
em
even
as
we
already
know
em
said
bounderby
with
many
nods
of
hidden
meaning
but
i
have
said
enough
for
the
present
you
ll
have
the
goodness
to
keep
it
quiet
and
mention
it
to
no
one
it
may
take
time
but
we
shall
have
em
it
s
policy
to
give
em
line
enough
and
there
s
no
objection
to
of
course
they
will
be
punished
with
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
law
as
observe
replied
james
harthouse
and
serve
them
right
fellows
who
go
in
for
banks
must
take
the
consequences
if
there
were
no
consequences
we
should
all
go
in
for
he
had
gently
taken
louisa
s
parasol
from
her
hand
and
had
put
it
up
for
her
and
she
walked
under
its
shade
though
the
sun
did
not
shine
there
for
the
present
loo
bounderby
said
her
husband
here
s
sparsit
to
look
after
sparsit
s
nerves
have
been
acted
upon
by
this
business
and
she
ll
stay
here
a
day
or
two
so
make
her
thank
you
very
much
sir
that
discreet
lady
observed
but
pray
do
not
let
my
comfort
be
a
consideration
anything
will
do
for
it
soon
appeared
that
if
sparsit
had
a
failing
in
her
association
with
that
domestic
establishment
it
was
that
she
was
so
excessively
regardless
of
herself
and
regardful
of
others
as
to
be
a
nuisance
on
being
shown
her
chamber
she
was
so
dreadfully
sensible
of
its
comforts
as
to
suggest
the
inference
that
she
would
have
preferred
to
pass
the
night
on
the
mangle
in
the
laundry
true
the
powlers
and
the
scadgerses
were
accustomed
to
splendour
but
it
is
my
duty
to
remember
sparsit
was
fond
of
observing
with
a
lofty
grace
particularly
when
any
of
the
domestics
were
present
that
what
i
was
i
am
no
longer
indeed
said
she
if
i
could
altogether
cancel
the
remembrance
that
sparsit
was
a
powler
or
that
i
myself
am
related
to
the
scadgers
family
or
if
i
could
even
revoke
the
fact
and
make
myself
a
person
of
common
descent
and
ordinary
connexions
i
would
gladly
do
so
i
should
think
it
under
existing
circumstances
right
to
do
the
same
hermitical
state
of
mind
led
to
her
renunciation
of
made
dishes
and
wines
at
dinner
until
fairly
commanded
by
bounderby
to
take
them
when
she
said
indeed
you
are
very
good
sir
and
departed
from
a
resolution
of
which
she
had
made
rather
formal
and
public
announcement
to
wait
for
the
simple
she
was
likewise
deeply
apologetic
for
wanting
the
salt
and
feeling
amiably
bound
to
bear
out
bounderby
to
the
fullest
extent
in
the
testimony
he
had
borne
to
her
nerves
occasionally
sat
back
in
her
chair
and
silently
wept
at
which
periods
a
tear
of
large
dimensions
like
a
crystal
might
be
observed
or
rather
must
be
for
it
insisted
on
public
notice
sliding
down
her
roman
nose
but
sparsit
s
greatest
point
first
and
last
was
her
determination
to
pity
bounderby
there
were
occasions
when
in
looking
at
him
she
was
involuntarily
moved
to
shake
her
head
as
who
would
say
alas
poor
yorick
after
allowing
herself
to
be
betrayed
into
these
evidences
of
emotion
she
would
force
a
lambent
brightness
and
would
be
fitfully
cheerful
and
would
say
you
have
still
good
spirits
sir
i
am
thankful
to
find
and
would
appear
to
hail
it
as
a
blessed
dispensation
that
bounderby
bore
up
as
he
did
one
idiosyncrasy
for
which
she
often
apologized
she
found
it
excessively
difficult
to
conquer
she
had
a
curious
propensity
to
call
bounderby
miss
gradgrind
and
yielded
to
it
some
three
or
four
score
times
in
the
course
of
the
evening
her
repetition
of
this
mistake
covered
sparsit
with
modest
confusion
but
indeed
she
said
it
seemed
so
natural
to
say
miss
gradgrind
whereas
to
persuade
herself
that
the
young
lady
whom
she
had
had
the
happiness
of
knowing
from
a
child
could
be
really
and
truly
bounderby
she
found
almost
impossible
it
was
a
further
singularity
of
this
remarkable
case
that
the
more
she
thought
about
it
the
more
impossible
it
appeared
the
differences
she
observed
being
in
the
after
dinner
bounderby
tried
the
case
of
the
robbery
examined
the
witnesses
made
notes
of
the
evidence
found
the
suspected
persons
guilty
and
sentenced
them
to
the
extreme
punishment
of
the
law
that
done
bitzer
was
dismissed
to
town
with
instructions
to
recommend
tom
to
come
home
by
the
when
candles
were
brought
sparsit
murmured
don
t
be
low
sir
pray
let
me
see
you
cheerful
sir
as
i
used
to
bounderby
upon
whom
these
consolations
had
begun
to
produce
the
effect
of
making
him
in
a
blundering
way
sentimental
sighed
like
some
large
i
can
not
bear
to
see
you
so
sir
said
sparsit
try
a
hand
at
backgammon
sir
as
you
used
to
do
when
i
had
the
honour
of
living
under
your
i
haven
t
played
backgammon
ma
am
said
bounderby
since
that
no
sir
said
sparsit
soothingly
i
am
aware
that
you
have
not
i
remember
that
miss
gradgrind
takes
no
interest
in
the
game
but
i
shall
be
happy
sir
if
you
will
they
played
near
a
window
opening
on
the
garden
it
was
a
fine
night
not
moonlight
but
sultry
and
fragrant
louisa
and
harthouse
strolled
out
into
the
garden
where
their
voices
could
be
heard
in
the
stillness
though
not
what
they
said
sparsit
from
her
place
at
the
backgammon
board
was
constantly
straining
her
eyes
to
pierce
the
shadows
without
what
s
the
matter
ma
am
said
bounderby
you
don
t
see
a
fire
do
you
oh
dear
no
sir
returned
sparsit
i
was
thinking
of
the
what
have
you
got
to
do
with
the
dew
ma
am
said
bounderby
it
s
not
myself
sir
returned
sparsit
i
am
fearful
of
miss
gradgrind
s
taking
she
never
takes
cold
said
bounderby
really
sir
said
sparsit
and
was
affected
with
a
cough
in
her
throat
when
the
time
drew
near
for
retiring
bounderby
took
a
glass
of
water
oh
sir
said
sparsit
not
your
sherry
warm
with
and
nutmeg
why
i
have
got
out
of
the
habit
of
taking
it
now
ma
am
said
bounderby
the
more
s
the
pity
sir
returned
sparsit
you
are
losing
all
your
good
old
habits
cheer
up
sir
if
miss
gradgrind
will
permit
me
i
will
offer
to
make
it
for
you
as
i
have
often
miss
gradgrind
readily
permitting
sparsit
to
do
anything
she
pleased
that
considerate
lady
made
the
beverage
and
handed
it
to
bounderby
it
will
do
you
good
sir
it
will
warm
your
heart
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
want
and
ought
to
take
and
when
bounderby
said
your
health
ma
am
she
answered
with
great
feeling
thank
you
sir
the
same
to
you
and
happiness
finally
she
wished
him
good
night
with
great
pathos
and
bounderby
went
to
bed
with
a
maudlin
persuasion
that
he
had
been
crossed
in
something
tender
though
he
could
not
for
his
life
have
mentioned
what
it
was
long
after
louisa
had
undressed
and
lain
down
she
watched
and
waited
for
her
brother
s
coming
home
that
could
hardly
be
she
knew
until
an
hour
past
midnight
but
in
the
country
silence
which
did
anything
but
calm
the
trouble
of
her
thoughts
time
lagged
wearily
at
last
when
the
darkness
and
stillness
had
seemed
for
hours
to
thicken
one
another
she
heard
the
bell
at
the
gate
she
felt
as
though
she
would
have
been
glad
that
it
rang
on
until
daylight
but
it
ceased
and
the
circles
of
its
last
sound
spread
out
fainter
and
wider
in
the
air
and
all
was
dead
again
she
waited
yet
some
quarter
of
an
hour
as
she
judged
then
she
arose
put
on
a
loose
robe
and
went
out
of
her
room
in
the
dark
and
up
the
staircase
to
her
brother
s
room
his
door
being
shut
she
softly
opened
it
and
spoke
to
him
approaching
his
bed
with
a
noiseless
step
she
kneeled
down
beside
it
passed
her
arm
over
his
neck
and
drew
his
face
to
hers
she
knew
that
he
only
feigned
to
be
asleep
but
she
said
nothing
to
him
he
started
by
and
by
as
if
he
were
just
then
awakened
and
asked
who
that
was
and
what
was
the
matter
tom
have
you
anything
to
tell
me
if
ever
you
loved
me
in
your
life
and
have
anything
concealed
from
every
one
besides
tell
it
to
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
loo
you
have
been
my
dear
brother
she
laid
her
head
down
on
his
pillow
and
her
hair
flowed
over
him
as
if
she
would
hide
him
from
every
one
but
herself
is
there
nothing
that
you
have
to
tell
me
is
there
nothing
you
can
tell
me
if
you
will
you
can
tell
me
nothing
that
will
change
me
o
tom
tell
me
the
truth
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
loo
as
you
lie
here
alone
my
dear
in
the
melancholy
night
so
you
must
lie
somewhere
one
night
when
even
i
if
i
am
living
then
shall
have
left
you
as
i
am
here
beside
you
barefoot
unclothed
undistinguishable
in
darkness
so
must
i
lie
through
all
the
night
of
my
decay
until
i
am
dust
in
the
name
of
that
time
tom
tell
me
the
truth
now
what
is
it
you
want
to
know
you
may
be
certain
in
the
energy
of
her
love
she
took
him
to
her
bosom
as
if
he
were
a
child
that
i
will
not
reproach
you
you
may
be
certain
that
i
will
be
compassionate
and
true
to
you
you
may
be
certain
that
i
will
save
you
at
whatever
cost
o
tom
have
you
nothing
to
tell
me
whisper
very
softly
say
only
yes
and
i
shall
understand
you
she
turned
her
ear
to
his
lips
but
he
remained
doggedly
silent
not
a
word
tom
how
can
i
say
yes
or
how
can
i
say
no
when
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
loo
you
are
a
brave
kind
girl
worthy
i
begin
to
think
of
a
better
brother
than
i
am
but
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
go
to
bed
go
to
you
are
tired
she
whispered
presently
more
in
her
usual
way
yes
i
am
quite
tired
you
have
been
so
hurried
and
disturbed
have
any
fresh
discoveries
been
made
only
those
you
have
heard
of
tom
have
you
said
to
any
one
that
we
made
a
visit
to
those
people
and
that
we
saw
those
three
together
no
didn
t
you
yourself
particularly
ask
me
to
keep
it
quiet
when
you
asked
me
to
go
there
with
you
yes
but
i
did
not
know
then
what
was
going
to
nor
i
neither
how
could
i
he
was
very
quick
upon
her
with
this
retort
ought
i
to
say
after
what
has
happened
said
his
sister
standing
by
the
had
gradually
withdrawn
herself
and
risen
that
i
made
that
visit
should
i
say
so
must
i
say
so
good
heavens
loo
returned
her
brother
you
are
not
in
the
habit
of
asking
my
advice
say
what
you
like
if
you
keep
it
to
yourself
i
shall
keep
it
to
if
you
disclose
it
there
s
an
end
of
it
was
too
dark
for
either
to
see
the
other
s
face
but
each
seemed
very
attentive
and
to
consider
before
speaking
tom
do
you
believe
the
man
i
gave
the
money
to
is
really
implicated
in
this
crime
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
see
why
he
shouldn
t
he
seemed
to
me
an
honest
another
person
may
seem
to
you
dishonest
and
yet
not
be
there
was
a
pause
for
he
had
hesitated
and
stopped
in
short
resumed
tom
as
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
if
you
come
to
that
perhaps
i
was
so
far
from
being
altogether
in
his
favour
that
i
took
him
outside
the
door
to
tell
him
quietly
that
i
thought
he
might
consider
himself
very
well
off
to
get
such
a
windfall
as
he
had
got
from
my
sister
and
that
i
hoped
he
would
make
good
use
of
it
you
remember
whether
i
took
him
out
or
not
i
say
nothing
against
the
man
he
may
be
a
very
good
fellow
for
anything
i
know
i
hope
he
was
he
offended
by
what
you
said
no
he
took
it
pretty
well
he
was
civil
enough
where
are
you
loo
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
kissed
her
good
night
my
dear
good
you
have
nothing
more
to
tell
me
no
what
should
i
have
you
wouldn
t
have
me
tell
you
a
lie
i
wouldn
t
have
you
do
that
tom
of
all
the
nights
in
your
life
many
and
much
happier
as
i
hope
they
will
thank
you
my
dear
loo
i
am
so
tired
that
i
am
sure
i
wonder
i
don
t
say
anything
to
get
to
sleep
go
to
bed
go
to
kissing
her
again
he
turned
round
drew
the
coverlet
over
his
head
and
lay
as
still
as
if
that
time
had
come
by
which
she
had
adjured
him
she
stood
for
some
time
at
the
bedside
before
she
slowly
moved
away
she
stopped
at
the
door
looked
back
when
she
had
opened
it
and
asked
him
if
he
had
called
her
but
he
lay
still
and
she
softly
closed
the
door
and
returned
to
her
room
then
the
wretched
boy
looked
cautiously
up
and
found
her
gone
crept
out
of
bed
fastened
his
door
and
threw
himself
upon
his
pillow
again
tearing
his
hair
morosely
crying
grudgingly
loving
her
hatefully
but
impenitently
spurning
himself
and
no
less
hatefully
and
unprofitably
spurning
all
the
good
in
the
world
chapter
ix
hearing
the
last
of
it
sparsit
lying
by
to
recover
the
tone
of
her
nerves
in
bounderby
s
retreat
kept
such
a
sharp
night
and
day
under
her
coriolanian
eyebrows
that
her
eyes
like
a
couple
of
lighthouses
on
an
coast
might
have
warned
all
prudent
mariners
from
that
bold
rock
her
roman
nose
and
the
dark
and
craggy
region
in
its
neighbourhood
but
for
the
placidity
of
her
manner
although
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
her
retiring
for
the
night
could
be
anything
but
a
form
so
severely
wide
awake
were
those
classical
eyes
of
hers
and
so
impossible
did
it
seem
that
her
rigid
nose
could
yield
to
any
relaxing
influence
yet
her
manner
of
sitting
smoothing
her
uncomfortable
not
to
say
gritty
mittens
they
were
constructed
of
a
cool
fabric
like
a
or
of
ambling
to
unknown
places
of
destination
with
her
foot
in
her
cotton
stirrup
was
so
perfectly
serene
that
most
observers
would
have
been
constrained
to
suppose
her
a
dove
embodied
by
some
freak
of
nature
in
the
earthly
tabernacle
of
a
bird
of
the
order
she
was
a
most
wonderful
woman
for
prowling
about
the
house
how
she
got
from
story
to
story
was
a
mystery
beyond
solution
a
lady
so
decorous
in
herself
and
so
highly
connected
was
not
to
be
suspected
of
dropping
over
the
banisters
or
sliding
down
them
yet
her
extraordinary
facility
of
locomotion
suggested
the
wild
idea
another
noticeable
circumstance
in
sparsit
was
that
she
was
never
hurried
she
would
shoot
with
consummate
velocity
from
the
roof
to
the
hall
yet
would
be
in
full
possession
of
her
breath
and
dignity
on
the
moment
of
her
arrival
there
neither
was
she
ever
seen
by
human
vision
to
go
at
a
great
pace
she
took
very
kindly
to
harthouse
and
had
some
pleasant
conversation
with
him
soon
after
her
arrival
she
made
him
her
stately
curtsey
in
the
garden
one
morning
before
breakfast
it
appears
but
yesterday
sir
said
sparsit
that
i
had
the
honour
of
receiving
you
at
the
bank
when
you
were
so
good
as
to
wish
to
be
made
acquainted
with
bounderby
s
an
occasion
i
am
sure
not
to
be
forgotten
by
myself
in
the
course
of
ages
said
harthouse
inclining
his
head
to
sparsit
with
the
most
indolent
of
all
possible
airs
we
live
in
a
singular
world
sir
said
sparsit
i
have
had
the
honour
by
a
coincidence
of
which
i
am
proud
to
have
made
a
remark
similar
in
effect
though
not
so
epigrammatically
a
singular
world
i
would
say
sir
pursued
sparsit
after
acknowledging
the
compliment
with
a
drooping
of
her
dark
eyebrows
not
altogether
so
mild
in
its
expression
as
her
voice
was
in
its
dulcet
tones
as
regards
the
intimacies
we
form
at
one
time
with
individuals
we
were
quite
ignorant
of
at
another
i
recall
sir
that
on
that
occasion
you
went
so
far
as
to
say
you
were
actually
apprehensive
of
miss
your
memory
does
me
more
honour
than
my
insignificance
deserves
i
availed
myself
of
your
obliging
hints
to
correct
my
timidity
and
it
is
unnecessary
to
add
that
they
were
perfectly
accurate
sparsit
s
talent
fact
for
anything
requiring
a
combination
of
strength
of
too
habitually
developed
to
admit
of
any
he
was
almost
falling
asleep
over
this
compliment
it
took
him
so
long
to
get
through
and
his
mind
wandered
so
much
in
the
course
of
its
execution
you
found
miss
really
can
not
call
her
bounderby
it
s
very
absurd
of
youthful
as
i
described
her
asked
sparsit
sweetly
you
drew
her
portrait
perfectly
said
harthouse
presented
her
dead
very
engaging
sir
said
sparsit
causing
her
mittens
slowly
to
revolve
over
one
another
highly
it
used
to
be
considered
said
sparsit
that
miss
gradgrind
was
wanting
in
animation
but
i
confess
she
appears
to
me
considerably
and
strikingly
improved
in
that
respect
ay
and
indeed
here
bounderby
cried
sparsit
nodding
her
head
a
great
many
times
as
if
she
had
been
talking
and
thinking
of
no
one
else
how
do
you
find
yourself
this
morning
sir
pray
let
us
see
you
cheerful
now
these
persistent
assuagements
of
his
misery
and
lightenings
of
his
load
had
by
this
time
begun
to
have
the
effect
of
making
bounderby
softer
than
usual
towards
sparsit
and
harder
than
usual
to
most
other
people
from
his
wife
downward
so
when
sparsit
said
with
forced
lightness
of
heart
you
want
your
breakfast
sir
but
i
dare
say
miss
gradgrind
will
soon
be
here
to
preside
at
the
table
bounderby
replied
if
i
waited
to
be
taken
care
of
by
my
wife
ma
am
i
believe
you
know
pretty
well
i
should
wait
till
doomsday
so
i
ll
trouble
to
take
charge
of
the
sparsit
complied
and
assumed
her
old
position
at
table
this
again
made
the
excellent
woman
vastly
sentimental
she
was
so
humble
withal
that
when
louisa
appeared
she
rose
protesting
she
never
could
think
of
sitting
in
that
place
under
existing
circumstances
often
as
she
had
had
the
honour
of
making
bounderby
s
breakfast
before
begged
pardon
she
meant
to
say
miss
hoped
to
be
excused
but
she
really
could
not
get
it
right
yet
though
she
trusted
to
become
familiar
with
it
by
and
assumed
her
present
position
it
was
only
she
observed
because
miss
gradgrind
happened
to
be
a
little
late
and
bounderby
s
time
was
so
very
precious
and
she
knew
it
of
old
to
be
so
essential
that
he
should
breakfast
to
the
moment
that
she
had
taken
the
liberty
of
complying
with
his
request
long
as
his
will
had
been
a
law
to
her
there
stop
where
you
are
ma
am
said
bounderby
stop
where
you
are
bounderby
will
be
very
glad
to
be
relieved
of
the
trouble
i
don
t
say
that
sir
returned
sparsit
almost
with
severity
because
that
is
very
unkind
to
bounderby
and
to
be
unkind
is
not
to
be
you
you
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
ma
can
take
it
very
quietly
can
t
you
loo
said
bounderby
in
a
blustering
way
to
his
wife
of
course
it
is
of
no
moment
why
should
it
be
of
any
importance
to
me
why
should
it
be
of
any
importance
to
any
one
sparsit
ma
am
said
bounderby
swelling
with
a
sense
of
slight
you
attach
too
much
importance
to
these
things
ma
am
by
george
you
ll
be
corrupted
in
some
of
your
notions
here
you
are
ma
am
you
are
behind
tom
gradgrind
s
children
s
what
is
the
matter
with
you
asked
louisa
coldly
surprised
what
has
given
you
offence
offence
repeated
bounderby
do
you
suppose
if
there
was
any
offence
given
me
i
shouldn
t
name
it
and
request
to
have
it
corrected
i
am
a
straightforward
man
i
believe
i
don
t
go
beating
about
for
i
suppose
no
one
ever
had
occasion
to
think
you
too
diffident
or
too
delicate
louisa
answered
him
composedly
i
have
never
made
that
objection
to
you
either
as
a
child
or
as
a
woman
i
don
t
understand
what
you
would
have
returned
bounderby
nothing
otherwise
don
t
you
loo
bounderby
know
thoroughly
well
that
i
josiah
bounderby
of
coketown
would
have
it
she
looked
at
him
as
he
struck
the
table
and
made
the
teacups
ring
with
a
proud
colour
in
her
face
that
was
a
new
change
harthouse
thought
you
are
incomprehensible
this
morning
said
louisa
pray
take
no
further
trouble
to
explain
yourself
i
am
not
curious
to
know
your
meaning
what
does
it
matter
nothing
more
was
said
on
this
theme
and
harthouse
was
soon
idly
gay
on
indifferent
subjects
but
from
this
day
the
sparsit
action
upon
bounderby
threw
louisa
and
james
harthouse
more
together
and
strengthened
the
dangerous
alienation
from
her
husband
and
confidence
against
him
with
another
into
which
she
had
fallen
by
degrees
so
fine
that
she
could
not
retrace
them
if
she
tried
but
whether
she
ever
tried
or
no
lay
hidden
in
her
own
closed
heart
sparsit
was
so
much
affected
on
this
particular
occasion
that
assisting
bounderby
to
his
hat
after
breakfast
and
being
then
alone
with
him
in
the
hall
she
imprinted
a
chaste
kiss
upon
his
hand
murmured
my
benefactor
and
retired
overwhelmed
with
grief
yet
it
is
an
indubitable
fact
within
the
cognizance
of
this
history
that
five
minutes
after
he
had
left
the
house
in
the
hat
the
same
descendant
of
the
scadgerses
and
connexion
by
matrimony
of
the
powlers
shook
her
mitten
at
his
portrait
made
a
contemptuous
grimace
at
that
work
of
art
and
said
serve
you
right
you
noodle
and
i
am
glad
of
bounderby
had
not
been
long
gone
when
bitzer
appeared
bitzer
had
come
down
by
train
shrieking
and
rattling
over
the
long
line
of
arches
that
bestrode
the
wild
country
of
past
and
present
with
an
express
from
stone
lodge
it
was
a
hasty
note
to
inform
louisa
that
gradgrind
lay
very
she
had
never
been
well
within
her
daughter
s
knowledge
but
she
had
declined
within
the
last
few
days
had
continued
sinking
all
through
the
night
and
was
now
as
nearly
dead
as
her
limited
capacity
of
being
in
any
state
that
implied
the
ghost
of
an
intention
to
get
out
of
it
allowed
accompanied
by
the
lightest
of
porters
fit
colourless
servitor
at
death
s
door
when
gradgrind
knocked
louisa
rumbled
to
coketown
over
the
past
and
present
and
was
whirled
into
its
smoky
jaws
she
dismissed
the
messenger
to
his
own
devices
and
rode
away
to
her
old
home
she
had
seldom
been
there
since
her
marriage
her
father
was
usually
sifting
and
sifting
at
his
parliamentary
in
london
without
being
observed
to
turn
up
many
precious
articles
among
the
rubbish
and
was
still
hard
at
it
in
the
national
her
mother
had
taken
it
rather
as
a
disturbance
than
otherwise
to
be
visited
as
she
reclined
upon
her
sofa
young
people
louisa
felt
herself
all
unfit
for
sissy
she
had
never
softened
to
again
since
the
night
when
the
stroller
s
child
had
raised
her
eyes
to
look
at
bounderby
s
intended
wife
she
had
no
inducements
to
go
back
and
had
rarely
gone
neither
as
she
approached
her
old
home
now
did
any
of
the
best
influences
of
old
home
descend
upon
her
the
dreams
of
airy
fables
its
graceful
beautiful
humane
impossible
adornments
of
the
world
beyond
so
good
to
be
believed
in
once
so
good
to
be
remembered
when
outgrown
for
then
the
least
among
them
rises
to
the
stature
of
a
great
charity
in
the
heart
suffering
little
children
to
come
into
the
midst
of
it
and
to
keep
with
their
pure
hands
a
garden
in
the
stony
ways
of
this
world
wherein
it
were
better
for
all
the
children
of
adam
that
they
should
oftener
sun
themselves
simple
and
trustful
and
not
had
she
to
do
with
these
remembrances
of
how
she
had
journeyed
to
the
little
that
she
knew
by
the
enchanted
roads
of
what
she
and
millions
of
innocent
creatures
had
hoped
and
imagined
of
how
first
coming
upon
reason
through
the
tender
light
of
fancy
she
had
seen
it
a
beneficent
god
deferring
to
gods
as
great
as
itself
not
a
grim
idol
cruel
and
cold
with
its
victims
bound
hand
to
foot
and
its
big
dumb
shape
set
up
with
a
sightless
stare
never
to
be
moved
by
anything
but
so
many
calculated
tons
of
had
she
to
do
with
these
her
remembrances
of
home
and
childhood
were
remembrances
of
the
drying
up
of
every
spring
and
fountain
in
her
young
heart
as
it
gushed
out
the
golden
waters
were
not
there
they
were
flowing
for
the
fertilization
of
the
land
where
grapes
are
gathered
from
thorns
and
figs
from
thistles
she
went
with
a
heavy
hardened
kind
of
sorrow
upon
her
into
the
house
and
into
her
mother
s
room
since
the
time
of
her
leaving
home
sissy
had
lived
with
the
rest
of
the
family
on
equal
terms
sissy
was
at
her
mother
s
side
and
jane
her
sister
now
ten
or
twelve
years
old
was
in
the
room
there
was
great
trouble
before
it
could
be
made
known
to
gradgrind
that
her
eldest
child
was
there
she
reclined
propped
up
from
mere
habit
on
a
couch
as
nearly
in
her
old
usual
attitude
as
anything
so
helpless
could
be
kept
in
she
had
positively
refused
to
take
to
her
bed
on
the
ground
that
if
she
did
she
would
never
hear
the
last
of
it
her
feeble
voice
sounded
so
far
away
in
her
bundle
of
shawls
and
the
sound
of
another
voice
addressing
her
seemed
to
take
such
a
long
time
in
getting
down
to
her
ears
that
she
might
have
been
lying
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
the
poor
lady
was
nearer
truth
than
she
ever
had
been
which
had
much
to
do
with
it
on
being
told
that
bounderby
was
there
she
replied
at
that
she
had
never
called
him
by
that
name
since
he
married
louisa
that
pending
her
choice
of
an
objectionable
name
she
had
called
him
j
and
that
she
could
not
at
present
depart
from
that
regulation
not
being
yet
provided
with
a
permanent
substitute
louisa
had
sat
by
her
for
some
minutes
and
had
spoken
to
her
often
before
she
arrived
at
a
clear
understanding
who
it
was
she
then
seemed
to
come
to
it
all
at
once
well
my
dear
said
gradgrind
and
i
hope
you
are
going
on
satisfactorily
to
yourself
it
was
all
your
father
s
doing
he
set
his
heart
upon
it
and
he
ought
to
i
want
to
hear
of
you
mother
not
of
you
want
to
hear
of
me
my
dear
that
s
something
new
i
am
sure
when
anybody
wants
to
hear
of
me
not
at
all
well
louisa
very
faint
and
are
you
in
pain
dear
mother
i
think
there
s
a
pain
somewhere
in
the
room
said
gradgrind
but
i
couldn
t
positively
say
that
i
have
got
after
this
strange
speech
she
lay
silent
for
some
time
louisa
holding
her
hand
could
feel
no
pulse
but
kissing
it
could
see
a
slight
thin
thread
of
life
in
fluttering
motion
you
very
seldom
see
your
sister
said
gradgrind
she
grows
like
you
i
wish
you
would
look
at
her
sissy
bring
her
she
was
brought
and
stood
with
her
hand
in
her
sister
s
louisa
had
observed
her
with
her
arm
round
sissy
s
neck
and
she
felt
the
difference
of
this
approach
do
you
see
the
likeness
louisa
yes
mother
i
should
think
her
like
me
eh
yes
i
always
say
so
gradgrind
cried
with
unexpected
quickness
and
that
reminds
me
want
to
speak
to
you
my
dear
sissy
my
good
girl
leave
us
alone
a
louisa
had
relinquished
the
hand
had
thought
that
her
sister
s
was
a
better
and
brighter
face
than
hers
had
ever
been
had
seen
in
it
not
without
a
rising
feeling
of
resentment
even
in
that
place
and
at
that
time
something
of
the
gentleness
of
the
other
face
in
the
room
the
sweet
face
with
the
trusting
eyes
made
paler
than
watching
and
sympathy
made
it
by
the
rich
dark
hair
left
alone
with
her
mother
louisa
saw
her
lying
with
an
awful
lull
upon
her
face
like
one
who
was
floating
away
upon
some
great
water
all
resistance
over
content
to
be
carried
down
the
stream
she
put
the
shadow
of
a
hand
to
her
lips
again
and
recalled
her
you
were
going
to
speak
to
me
eh
yes
to
be
sure
my
dear
you
know
your
father
is
almost
always
away
now
and
therefore
i
must
write
to
him
about
about
what
mother
don
t
be
troubled
about
what
you
must
remember
my
dear
that
whenever
i
have
said
anything
on
any
subject
i
have
never
heard
the
last
of
it
and
consequently
that
i
have
long
left
off
saying
i
can
hear
you
but
it
was
only
by
dint
of
bending
down
to
her
ear
and
at
the
same
time
attentively
watching
the
lips
as
they
moved
that
she
could
link
such
faint
and
broken
sounds
into
any
chain
of
connexion
you
learnt
a
great
deal
louisa
and
so
did
your
brother
ologies
of
all
kinds
from
morning
to
night
if
there
is
any
ology
left
of
any
description
that
has
not
been
worn
to
rags
in
this
house
all
i
can
say
is
i
hope
i
shall
never
hear
its
i
can
hear
you
mother
when
you
have
strength
to
go
this
to
keep
her
from
floating
away
but
there
is
an
ology
at
your
father
has
missed
or
forgotten
louisa
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
i
have
often
sat
with
sissy
near
me
and
thought
about
it
i
shall
never
get
its
name
now
but
your
father
may
it
makes
me
restless
i
want
to
write
to
him
to
find
out
for
god
s
sake
what
it
is
give
me
a
pen
give
me
a
even
the
power
of
restlessness
was
gone
except
from
the
poor
head
which
could
just
turn
from
side
to
side
she
fancied
however
that
her
request
had
been
complied
with
and
that
the
pen
she
could
not
have
held
was
in
her
hand
it
matters
little
what
figures
of
wonderful
she
began
to
trace
upon
her
wrappers
the
hand
soon
stopped
in
the
midst
of
them
the
light
that
had
always
been
feeble
and
dim
behind
the
weak
transparency
went
out
and
even
gradgrind
emerged
from
the
shadow
in
which
man
walketh
and
disquieteth
himself
in
vain
took
upon
her
the
dread
solemnity
of
the
sages
and
patriarchs
chapter
x
sparsit
s
staircase
sparsit
s
nerves
being
slow
to
recover
their
tone
the
worthy
woman
made
a
stay
of
some
weeks
in
duration
at
bounderby
s
retreat
where
notwithstanding
her
anchorite
turn
of
mind
based
upon
her
becoming
consciousness
of
her
altered
station
she
resigned
herself
with
noble
fortitude
to
lodging
as
one
may
say
in
clover
and
feeding
on
the
fat
of
the
land
during
the
whole
term
of
this
recess
from
the
guardianship
of
the
bank
sparsit
was
a
pattern
of
consistency
continuing
to
take
such
pity
on
bounderby
to
his
face
as
is
rarely
taken
on
man
and
to
call
his
portrait
a
noodle
to
face
with
the
greatest
acrimony
and
contempt
bounderby
having
got
it
into
his
explosive
composition
that
sparsit
was
a
highly
superior
woman
to
perceive
that
he
had
that
general
cross
upon
him
in
his
deserts
for
he
had
not
yet
settled
what
it
was
and
further
that
louisa
would
have
objected
to
her
as
a
frequent
visitor
if
it
had
comported
with
his
greatness
that
she
should
object
to
anything
he
chose
to
do
resolved
not
to
lose
sight
of
sparsit
easily
so
when
her
nerves
were
strung
up
to
the
pitch
of
again
consuming
sweetbreads
in
solitude
he
said
to
her
at
the
on
the
day
before
her
departure
i
tell
you
what
ma
am
you
shall
come
down
here
of
a
saturday
while
the
fine
weather
lasts
and
stay
till
to
which
sparsit
returned
in
effect
though
not
of
the
mahomedan
persuasion
to
hear
is
to
now
sparsit
was
not
a
poetical
woman
but
she
took
an
idea
in
the
nature
of
an
allegorical
fancy
into
her
head
much
watching
of
louisa
and
much
consequent
observation
of
her
impenetrable
demeanour
which
keenly
whetted
and
sharpened
sparsit
s
edge
must
have
given
her
as
it
were
a
lift
in
the
way
of
inspiration
she
erected
in
her
mind
a
mighty
staircase
with
a
dark
pit
of
shame
and
ruin
at
the
bottom
and
down
those
stairs
from
day
to
day
and
hour
to
hour
she
saw
louisa
coming
it
became
the
business
of
sparsit
s
life
to
look
up
at
her
staircase
and
to
watch
louisa
coming
down
sometimes
slowly
sometimes
quickly
sometimes
several
steps
at
one
bout
sometimes
stopping
never
turning
back
if
she
had
once
turned
back
it
might
have
been
the
death
of
sparsit
in
spleen
and
grief
she
had
been
descending
steadily
to
the
day
and
on
the
day
when
bounderby
issued
the
weekly
invitation
recorded
above
sparsit
was
in
good
spirits
and
inclined
to
be
conversational
and
pray
sir
said
she
if
i
may
venture
to
ask
a
question
appertaining
to
any
subject
on
which
you
show
is
indeed
hardy
in
me
for
i
well
know
you
have
a
reason
for
everything
you
you
received
intelligence
respecting
the
robbery
why
ma
am
no
not
yet
under
the
circumstances
i
didn
t
expect
it
yet
rome
wasn
t
built
in
a
day
ma
very
true
sir
said
sparsit
shaking
her
head
nor
yet
in
a
week
ma
no
indeed
sir
returned
sparsit
with
a
gentle
melancholy
upon
her
in
a
similar
manner
ma
am
said
bounderby
i
can
wait
you
know
if
romulus
and
remus
could
wait
josiah
bounderby
can
wait
they
were
better
off
in
their
youth
than
i
was
however
they
had
a
for
a
nurse
i
had
only
a
for
a
grandmother
she
didn
t
give
any
milk
ma
am
she
gave
bruises
she
was
a
regular
alderney
at
ah
sparsit
sighed
and
shuddered
no
ma
am
continued
bounderby
i
have
not
heard
anything
more
about
it
it
s
in
hand
though
and
young
tom
who
rather
sticks
to
business
at
new
for
him
he
hadn
t
the
schooling
helping
my
injunction
is
keep
it
quiet
and
let
it
seem
to
blow
over
do
what
you
like
under
the
rose
but
don
t
give
a
sign
of
what
you
re
about
or
half
a
hundred
of
em
will
combine
together
and
get
this
fellow
who
has
bolted
out
of
reach
for
good
keep
it
quiet
and
the
thieves
will
grow
in
confidence
by
little
and
little
and
we
shall
have
very
sagacious
indeed
sir
said
sparsit
very
interesting
the
old
woman
you
mentioned
the
old
woman
i
mentioned
ma
am
said
bounderby
cutting
the
matter
short
as
it
was
nothing
to
boast
about
is
not
laid
hold
of
but
she
may
take
her
oath
she
will
be
if
that
is
any
satisfaction
to
her
villainous
old
mind
in
the
mean
time
ma
am
i
am
of
opinion
if
you
ask
me
my
opinion
that
the
less
she
is
talked
about
the
the
same
evening
sparsit
in
her
chamber
window
resting
from
her
packing
operations
looked
towards
her
great
staircase
and
saw
louisa
still
descending
she
sat
by
harthouse
in
an
alcove
in
the
garden
talking
very
low
he
stood
leaning
over
her
as
they
whispered
together
and
his
face
almost
touched
her
hair
if
not
quite
said
sparsit
straining
her
hawk
s
eyes
to
the
utmost
sparsit
was
too
distant
to
hear
a
word
of
their
discourse
or
even
to
know
that
they
were
speaking
softly
otherwise
than
from
the
expression
of
their
figures
but
what
they
said
was
this
you
recollect
the
man
harthouse
oh
perfectly
his
face
and
his
manner
and
what
he
said
perfectly
and
an
infinitely
dreary
person
he
appeared
to
me
to
be
lengthy
and
prosy
in
the
extreme
it
was
knowing
to
hold
forth
in
the
school
of
eloquence
but
i
assure
you
i
thought
at
the
time
my
good
fellow
you
are
this
it
has
been
very
difficult
to
me
to
think
ill
of
that
my
dear
tom
which
he
never
did
say
you
know
no
good
of
the
fellow
no
nor
of
any
other
such
person
how
can
i
she
returned
with
more
of
her
first
manner
on
her
than
he
had
lately
seen
when
i
know
nothing
of
them
men
or
women
my
dear
louisa
then
consent
to
receive
the
submissive
representation
of
your
devoted
friend
who
knows
something
of
several
varieties
of
his
excellent
excellent
they
are
i
am
quite
ready
to
believe
in
spite
of
such
little
foibles
as
always
helping
themselves
to
what
they
can
get
hold
of
this
fellow
talks
well
every
fellow
talks
he
professes
morality
well
all
sorts
of
humbugs
profess
morality
from
the
house
of
commons
to
the
house
of
correction
there
is
a
general
profession
of
morality
except
among
our
people
it
really
is
that
exception
which
makes
our
people
quite
reviving
you
saw
and
heard
the
case
here
was
one
of
the
fluffy
classes
pulled
up
extremely
short
by
my
esteemed
friend
as
we
know
is
not
possessed
of
that
delicacy
which
would
soften
so
tight
a
hand
the
member
of
the
fluffy
classes
was
injured
exasperated
left
the
house
grumbling
met
somebody
who
proposed
to
him
to
go
in
for
some
share
in
this
bank
business
went
in
put
something
in
his
pocket
which
had
nothing
in
it
before
and
relieved
his
mind
extremely
really
he
would
have
been
an
uncommon
instead
of
a
common
fellow
if
he
had
not
availed
himself
of
such
an
opportunity
or
he
may
have
originated
it
altogether
if
he
had
the
i
almost
feel
as
though
it
must
be
bad
in
me
returned
louisa
after
sitting
thoughtful
awhile
to
be
so
ready
to
agree
with
you
and
to
be
so
lightened
in
my
heart
by
what
you
i
only
say
what
is
reasonable
nothing
worse
i
have
talked
it
over
with
my
friend
tom
more
than
course
i
remain
on
terms
of
perfect
confidence
with
he
is
quite
of
my
opinion
and
i
am
quite
of
his
will
you
walk
they
strolled
away
among
the
lanes
beginning
to
be
indistinct
in
the
leaning
on
his
she
little
thought
how
she
was
going
down
down
down
sparsit
s
staircase
night
and
day
sparsit
kept
it
standing
when
louisa
had
arrived
at
the
bottom
and
disappeared
in
the
gulf
it
might
fall
in
upon
her
if
it
would
but
until
then
there
it
was
to
be
a
building
before
sparsit
s
eyes
and
there
louisa
always
was
upon
it
and
always
gliding
down
down
down
sparsit
saw
james
harthouse
come
and
go
she
heard
of
him
here
and
there
she
saw
the
changes
of
the
face
he
had
studied
she
too
remarked
to
a
nicety
how
and
when
it
clouded
how
and
when
it
cleared
she
kept
her
black
eyes
wide
open
with
no
touch
of
pity
with
no
touch
of
compunction
all
absorbed
in
interest
in
the
interest
of
seeing
her
ever
drawing
with
no
hand
to
stay
her
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
bottom
of
this
new
giant
s
staircase
with
all
her
deference
for
bounderby
as
contradistinguished
from
his
portrait
sparsit
had
not
the
smallest
intention
of
interrupting
the
descent
eager
to
see
it
accomplished
and
yet
patient
she
waited
for
the
last
fall
as
for
the
ripeness
and
fulness
of
the
harvest
of
her
hopes
hushed
in
expectancy
she
kept
her
wary
gaze
upon
the
stairs
and
seldom
so
much
as
darkly
shook
her
right
mitten
with
her
fist
in
it
at
the
figure
coming
down
chapter
xi
lower
and
lower
the
figure
descended
the
great
stairs
steadily
steadily
always
verging
like
a
weight
in
deep
water
to
the
black
gulf
at
the
bottom
gradgrind
apprised
of
his
wife
s
decease
made
an
expedition
from
london
and
buried
her
in
a
manner
he
then
returned
with
promptitude
to
the
national
and
resumed
his
sifting
for
the
odds
and
ends
he
wanted
and
his
throwing
of
the
dust
about
into
the
eyes
of
other
people
who
wanted
other
odds
and
fact
resumed
his
parliamentary
duties
in
the
meantime
sparsit
kept
unwinking
watch
and
ward
separated
from
her
staircase
all
the
week
by
the
length
of
iron
road
dividing
coketown
from
the
country
house
she
yet
maintained
her
observation
of
louisa
through
her
husband
through
her
brother
through
james
harthouse
through
the
outsides
of
letters
and
packets
through
everything
animate
and
inanimate
that
at
any
time
went
near
the
stairs
your
foot
on
the
last
step
my
lady
said
sparsit
apostrophizing
the
descending
figure
with
the
aid
of
her
threatening
mitten
and
all
your
art
shall
never
blind
art
or
nature
though
the
original
stock
of
louisa
s
character
or
the
graft
of
circumstances
upon
it
curious
reserve
did
baffle
while
it
stimulated
one
as
sagacious
as
sparsit
there
were
times
when
james
harthouse
was
not
sure
of
her
there
were
times
when
he
could
not
read
the
face
he
had
studied
so
long
and
when
this
lonely
girl
was
a
greater
mystery
to
him
than
any
woman
of
the
world
with
a
ring
of
satellites
to
help
her
so
the
time
went
on
until
it
happened
that
bounderby
was
called
away
from
home
by
business
which
required
his
presence
elsewhere
for
three
or
four
days
it
was
on
a
friday
that
he
intimated
this
to
sparsit
at
the
bank
adding
but
you
ll
go
down
ma
am
all
the
same
you
ll
go
down
just
as
if
i
was
there
it
will
make
no
difference
to
pray
sir
returned
sparsit
reproachfully
let
me
beg
you
not
to
say
that
your
absence
will
make
a
vast
difference
to
me
sir
as
i
think
you
very
well
well
ma
am
then
you
must
get
on
in
my
absence
as
well
as
you
can
said
bounderby
not
displeased
mr
bounderby
retorted
sparsit
your
will
is
to
me
a
law
sir
otherwise
it
might
be
my
inclination
to
dispute
your
kind
commands
not
feeling
sure
that
it
will
be
quite
so
agreeable
to
miss
gradgrind
to
receive
me
as
it
ever
is
to
your
own
munificent
hospitality
but
you
shall
say
no
more
sir
i
will
go
upon
your
why
when
i
invite
you
to
my
house
ma
am
said
bounderby
opening
his
eyes
i
should
hope
you
want
no
other
no
indeed
sir
returned
sparsit
i
should
hope
not
say
no
more
sir
i
would
sir
i
could
see
you
gay
what
do
you
mean
ma
am
blustered
bounderby
sir
rejoined
sparsit
there
was
wont
to
be
an
elasticity
in
you
which
i
sadly
miss
be
buoyant
sir
bounderby
under
the
influence
of
this
difficult
adjuration
backed
up
by
her
compassionate
eye
could
only
scratch
his
head
in
a
feeble
and
ridiculous
manner
and
afterwards
assert
himself
at
a
distance
by
being
heard
to
bully
the
small
fry
of
business
all
the
morning
bitzer
said
sparsit
that
afternoon
when
her
patron
was
gone
on
his
journey
and
the
bank
was
closing
present
my
compliments
to
young
thomas
and
ask
him
if
he
would
step
up
and
partake
of
a
lamb
chop
and
walnut
ketchup
with
a
glass
of
india
ale
young
thomas
being
usually
ready
for
anything
in
that
way
returned
a
gracious
answer
and
followed
on
its
heels
mr
thomas
said
sparsit
these
plain
viands
being
on
table
i
thought
you
might
be
thank
ee
sparsit
said
the
whelp
and
gloomily
fell
to
how
is
harthouse
tom
asked
sparsit
oh
he
s
all
right
said
tom
where
may
he
be
at
present
sparsit
asked
in
a
light
conversational
manner
after
mentally
devoting
the
whelp
to
the
furies
for
being
so
uncommunicative
he
is
shooting
in
yorkshire
said
tom
sent
loo
a
basket
half
as
big
as
a
church
the
kind
of
gentleman
now
said
sparsit
sweetly
whom
one
might
wager
to
be
a
good
shot
crack
said
tom
he
had
long
been
a
young
fellow
but
this
characteristic
had
so
increased
of
late
that
he
never
raised
his
eyes
to
any
face
for
three
seconds
together
sparsit
consequently
had
ample
means
of
watching
his
looks
if
she
were
so
inclined
mr
harthouse
is
a
great
favourite
of
mine
said
sparsit
as
indeed
he
is
of
most
people
may
we
expect
to
see
him
again
shortly
tom
why
expect
to
see
him
returned
the
whelp
good
news
cried
sparsit
blandly
i
have
got
an
appointment
with
him
to
meet
him
in
the
evening
at
the
station
here
said
tom
and
i
am
going
to
dine
with
him
afterwards
i
believe
he
is
not
coming
down
to
the
country
house
for
a
week
or
so
being
due
somewhere
else
at
least
he
says
so
but
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
he
was
to
stop
here
over
sunday
and
stray
that
which
reminds
me
said
sparsit
would
you
remember
a
message
to
your
sister
tom
if
i
was
to
charge
you
with
one
well
i
ll
try
returned
the
reluctant
whelp
if
it
isn
t
a
long
it
is
merely
my
respectful
compliments
said
sparsit
and
i
fear
i
may
not
trouble
her
with
my
society
this
week
being
still
a
little
nervous
and
better
perhaps
by
my
poor
oh
if
that
s
all
observed
tom
it
wouldn
t
much
matter
even
if
i
was
to
forget
it
for
loo
s
not
likely
to
think
of
you
unless
she
sees
having
paid
for
his
entertainment
with
this
agreeable
compliment
he
relapsed
into
a
hangdog
silence
until
there
was
no
more
india
ale
left
when
he
said
well
sparsit
i
must
be
off
and
went
off
next
day
saturday
sparsit
sat
at
her
window
all
day
long
looking
at
the
customers
coming
in
and
out
watching
the
postmen
keeping
an
eye
on
the
general
traffic
of
the
street
revolving
many
things
in
her
mind
but
above
all
keeping
her
attention
on
her
staircase
the
evening
come
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
went
quietly
out
having
her
reasons
for
hovering
in
a
furtive
way
about
the
station
by
which
a
passenger
would
arrive
from
yorkshire
and
for
preferring
to
peep
into
it
round
pillars
and
corners
and
out
of
ladies
windows
to
appearing
in
its
precincts
openly
tom
was
in
attendance
and
loitered
about
until
the
expected
train
came
in
it
brought
no
harthouse
tom
waited
until
the
crowd
had
dispersed
and
the
bustle
was
over
and
then
referred
to
a
posted
list
of
trains
and
took
counsel
with
porters
that
done
he
strolled
away
idly
stopping
in
the
street
and
looking
up
it
and
down
it
and
lifting
his
hat
off
and
putting
it
on
again
and
yawning
and
stretching
himself
and
exhibiting
all
the
symptoms
of
mortal
weariness
to
be
expected
in
one
who
had
still
to
wait
until
the
next
train
should
come
in
an
hour
and
forty
minutes
hence
this
is
a
device
to
keep
him
out
of
the
way
said
sparsit
starting
from
the
dull
office
window
whence
she
had
watched
him
last
harthouse
is
with
his
sister
now
it
was
the
conception
of
an
inspired
moment
and
she
shot
off
with
her
utmost
swiftness
to
work
it
out
the
station
for
the
country
house
was
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
town
the
time
was
short
the
road
not
easy
but
she
was
so
quick
in
pouncing
on
a
disengaged
coach
so
quick
in
darting
out
of
it
producing
her
money
seizing
her
ticket
and
diving
into
the
train
that
she
was
borne
along
the
arches
spanning
the
land
of
past
and
present
as
if
she
had
been
caught
up
in
a
cloud
and
whirled
away
all
the
journey
immovable
in
the
air
though
never
left
behind
plain
to
the
dark
eyes
of
her
mind
as
the
electric
wires
which
ruled
a
colossal
strip
of
out
of
the
evening
sky
were
plain
to
the
dark
eyes
of
her
body
sparsit
saw
her
staircase
with
the
figure
coming
down
very
near
the
bottom
now
upon
the
brink
of
the
abyss
an
overcast
september
evening
just
at
nightfall
saw
beneath
its
drooping
eyelids
sparsit
glide
out
of
her
carriage
pass
down
the
wooden
steps
of
the
little
station
into
a
stony
road
cross
it
into
a
green
lane
and
become
hidden
in
a
of
leaves
and
branches
one
or
two
late
birds
sleepily
chirping
in
their
nests
and
a
bat
heavily
crossing
and
recrossing
her
and
the
reek
of
her
own
tread
in
the
thick
dust
that
felt
like
velvet
were
all
sparsit
heard
or
saw
until
she
very
softly
closed
a
gate
she
went
up
to
the
house
keeping
within
the
shrubbery
and
went
round
it
peeping
between
the
leaves
at
the
lower
windows
most
of
them
were
open
as
they
usually
were
in
such
warm
weather
but
there
were
no
lights
yet
and
all
was
silent
she
tried
the
garden
with
no
better
effect
she
thought
of
the
wood
and
stole
towards
it
heedless
of
long
grass
and
briers
of
worms
snails
and
slugs
and
all
the
creeping
things
that
be
with
her
dark
eyes
and
her
hook
nose
warily
in
advance
of
her
sparsit
softly
crushed
her
way
through
the
thick
undergrowth
so
intent
upon
her
object
that
she
probably
would
have
done
no
less
if
the
wood
had
been
a
wood
of
adders
hark
the
smaller
birds
might
have
tumbled
out
of
their
nests
fascinated
by
the
glittering
of
sparsit
s
eyes
in
the
gloom
as
she
stopped
and
listened
low
voices
close
at
hand
his
voice
and
hers
the
appointment
a
device
to
keep
the
brother
away
there
they
were
yonder
by
the
felled
tree
bending
low
among
the
dewy
grass
sparsit
advanced
closer
to
them
she
drew
herself
up
and
stood
behind
a
tree
like
robinson
crusoe
in
his
ambuscade
against
the
savages
so
near
to
them
that
at
a
spring
and
that
no
great
one
she
could
have
touched
them
both
he
was
there
secretly
and
had
not
shown
himself
at
the
house
he
had
come
on
horseback
and
must
have
passed
through
the
neighbouring
fields
for
his
horse
was
tied
to
the
meadow
side
of
the
fence
within
a
few
paces
my
dearest
love
said
he
what
could
i
do
knowing
you
were
alone
was
it
possible
that
i
could
stay
away
you
may
hang
your
head
to
make
yourself
the
more
attractive
don
t
know
what
they
see
in
you
when
you
hold
it
up
thought
sparsit
but
you
little
think
my
dearest
love
whose
eyes
are
on
you
that
she
hung
her
head
was
certain
she
urged
him
to
go
away
she
commanded
him
to
go
away
but
she
neither
turned
her
face
to
him
nor
raised
it
yet
it
was
remarkable
that
she
sat
as
still
as
ever
the
amiable
woman
in
ambuscade
had
seen
her
sit
at
any
period
in
her
life
her
hands
rested
in
one
another
like
the
hands
of
a
statue
and
even
her
manner
of
speaking
was
not
hurried
my
dear
child
said
harthouse
sparsit
saw
with
delight
that
his
arm
embraced
her
will
you
not
bear
with
my
society
for
a
little
while
not
where
louisa
not
but
we
have
so
little
time
to
make
so
much
of
and
i
have
come
so
far
and
am
altogether
so
devoted
and
distracted
there
never
was
a
slave
at
once
so
devoted
and
by
his
mistress
to
look
for
your
sunny
welcome
that
has
warmed
me
into
life
and
to
be
received
in
your
frozen
manner
is
am
i
to
say
again
that
i
must
be
left
to
myself
here
but
we
must
meet
my
dear
louisa
where
shall
we
meet
they
both
started
the
listener
started
guiltily
too
for
she
thought
there
was
another
listener
among
the
trees
it
was
only
rain
beginning
to
fall
fast
in
heavy
drops
shall
i
ride
up
to
the
house
a
few
minutes
hence
innocently
supposing
that
its
master
is
at
home
and
will
be
charmed
to
receive
me
no
your
cruel
commands
are
implicitly
to
be
obeyed
though
i
am
the
most
unfortunate
fellow
in
the
world
i
believe
to
have
been
insensible
to
all
other
women
and
to
have
fallen
prostrate
at
last
under
the
foot
of
the
most
beautiful
and
the
most
engaging
and
the
most
imperious
my
dearest
louisa
i
can
not
go
myself
or
let
you
go
in
this
hard
abuse
of
your
sparsit
saw
him
detain
her
with
his
encircling
arm
and
heard
him
then
and
there
within
her
sparsit
s
greedy
hearing
tell
her
how
he
loved
her
and
how
she
was
the
stake
for
which
he
ardently
desired
to
play
away
all
that
he
had
in
life
the
objects
he
had
lately
pursued
turned
worthless
beside
her
such
success
as
was
almost
in
his
grasp
he
flung
away
from
him
like
the
dirt
it
was
compared
with
her
its
pursuit
nevertheless
if
it
kept
him
near
her
or
its
renunciation
if
it
took
him
from
her
or
flight
if
she
shared
it
or
secrecy
if
she
commanded
it
or
any
fate
or
every
fate
all
was
alike
to
him
so
that
she
was
true
to
him
man
who
had
seen
how
cast
away
she
was
whom
she
had
inspired
at
their
first
meeting
with
an
admiration
an
interest
of
which
he
had
thought
himself
incapable
whom
she
had
received
into
her
confidence
who
was
devoted
to
her
and
adored
her
all
this
and
more
in
his
hurry
and
in
hers
in
the
whirl
of
her
own
gratified
malice
in
the
dread
of
being
discovered
in
the
rapidly
increasing
noise
of
heavy
rain
among
the
leaves
and
a
thunderstorm
rolling
sparsit
received
into
her
mind
set
off
with
such
an
unavoidable
halo
of
confusion
and
indistinctness
that
when
at
length
he
climbed
the
fence
and
led
his
horse
away
she
was
not
sure
where
they
were
to
meet
or
when
except
that
they
had
said
it
was
to
be
that
night
but
one
of
them
yet
remained
in
the
darkness
before
her
and
while
she
tracked
that
one
she
must
be
right
oh
my
dearest
love
thought
sparsit
you
little
think
how
well
attended
you
are
sparsit
saw
her
out
of
the
wood
and
saw
her
enter
the
house
what
to
do
next
it
rained
now
in
a
sheet
of
water
sparsit
s
white
stockings
were
of
many
colours
green
predominating
prickly
things
were
in
her
shoes
caterpillars
slung
themselves
in
hammocks
of
their
own
making
from
various
parts
of
her
dress
rills
ran
from
her
bonnet
and
her
roman
nose
in
such
condition
sparsit
stood
hidden
in
the
density
of
the
shrubbery
considering
what
next
lo
louisa
coming
out
of
the
house
hastily
cloaked
and
muffled
and
stealing
away
she
elopes
she
falls
from
the
lowermost
stair
and
is
swallowed
up
in
the
gulf
indifferent
to
the
rain
and
moving
with
a
quick
determined
step
she
struck
into
a
parallel
with
the
ride
sparsit
followed
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
at
but
a
short
distance
for
it
was
not
easy
to
keep
a
figure
in
view
going
quickly
through
the
umbrageous
darkness
when
she
stopped
to
close
the
without
noise
sparsit
stopped
when
she
went
on
sparsit
went
on
she
went
by
the
way
sparsit
had
come
emerged
from
the
green
lane
crossed
the
stony
road
and
ascended
the
wooden
steps
to
the
railroad
a
train
for
coketown
would
come
through
presently
sparsit
knew
so
she
understood
coketown
to
be
her
first
place
of
destination
in
sparsit
s
limp
and
streaming
state
no
extensive
precautions
were
necessary
to
change
her
usual
appearance
but
she
stopped
under
the
lee
of
the
station
wall
tumbled
her
shawl
into
a
new
shape
and
put
it
on
over
her
bonnet
so
disguised
she
had
no
fear
of
being
recognized
when
she
followed
up
the
railroad
steps
and
paid
her
money
in
the
small
office
louisa
sat
waiting
in
a
corner
sparsit
sat
waiting
in
another
corner
both
listened
to
the
thunder
which
was
loud
and
to
the
rain
as
it
washed
off
the
roof
and
pattered
on
the
parapets
of
the
arches
two
or
three
lamps
were
rained
out
and
blown
out
so
both
saw
the
lightning
to
advantage
as
it
quivered
and
zigzagged
on
the
iron
tracks
the
seizure
of
the
station
with
a
fit
of
trembling
gradually
deepening
to
a
complaint
of
the
heart
announced
the
train
fire
and
steam
and
smoke
and
red
light
a
hiss
a
crash
a
bell
and
a
shriek
louisa
put
into
one
carriage
sparsit
put
into
another
the
little
station
a
desert
speck
in
the
thunderstorm
though
her
teeth
chattered
in
her
head
from
wet
and
cold
sparsit
exulted
hugely
the
figure
had
plunged
down
the
precipice
and
she
felt
herself
as
it
were
attending
on
the
body
could
she
who
had
been
so
active
in
the
getting
up
of
the
funeral
triumph
do
less
than
exult
she
will
be
at
coketown
long
before
him
thought
sparsit
though
his
horse
is
never
so
good
where
will
she
wait
for
him
and
where
will
they
go
together
patience
we
shall
the
tremendous
rain
occasioned
infinite
confusion
when
the
train
stopped
at
its
destination
gutters
and
pipes
had
burst
drains
had
overflowed
and
streets
were
under
water
in
the
first
instant
of
alighting
sparsit
turned
her
distracted
eyes
towards
the
waiting
coaches
which
were
in
great
request
she
will
get
into
one
she
considered
and
will
be
away
before
i
can
follow
in
another
at
all
risks
of
being
run
over
i
must
see
the
number
and
hear
the
order
given
to
the
but
sparsit
was
wrong
in
her
calculation
louisa
got
into
no
coach
and
was
already
gone
the
black
eyes
kept
upon
the
in
which
she
had
travelled
settled
upon
it
a
moment
too
late
the
door
not
being
opened
after
several
minutes
sparsit
passed
it
and
repassed
it
saw
nothing
looked
in
and
found
it
empty
wet
through
and
through
with
her
feet
squelching
and
squashing
in
her
shoes
whenever
she
moved
with
a
rash
of
rain
upon
her
classical
visage
with
a
bonnet
like
an
fig
with
all
her
clothes
spoiled
with
damp
impressions
of
every
button
string
and
she
wore
printed
off
upon
her
highly
connected
back
with
a
stagnant
verdure
on
her
general
exterior
such
as
accumulates
on
an
old
park
fence
in
a
mouldy
lane
sparsit
had
no
resource
but
to
burst
into
tears
of
bitterness
and
say
i
have
lost
her
chapter
xii
down
the
national
dustmen
after
entertaining
one
another
with
a
great
many
noisy
little
fights
among
themselves
had
dispersed
for
the
present
and
gradgrind
was
at
home
for
the
vacation
he
sat
writing
in
the
room
with
the
deadly
statistical
clock
proving
something
no
in
the
main
that
the
good
samaritan
was
a
bad
economist
the
noise
of
the
rain
did
not
disturb
him
much
but
it
attracted
his
attention
sufficiently
to
make
him
raise
his
head
sometimes
as
if
he
were
rather
remonstrating
with
the
elements
when
it
thundered
very
loudly
he
glanced
towards
coketown
having
it
in
his
mind
that
some
of
the
tall
chimneys
might
be
struck
by
lightning
the
thunder
was
rolling
into
distance
and
the
rain
was
pouring
down
like
a
deluge
when
the
door
of
his
room
opened
he
looked
round
the
lamp
upon
his
table
and
saw
with
amazement
his
eldest
daughter
louisa
father
i
want
to
speak
to
what
is
the
matter
how
strange
you
look
and
good
heaven
said
gradgrind
wondering
more
and
more
have
you
come
here
exposed
to
this
storm
she
put
her
hands
to
her
dress
as
if
she
hardly
knew
then
she
uncovered
her
head
and
letting
her
cloak
and
hood
fall
where
they
might
stood
looking
at
him
so
colourless
so
dishevelled
so
defiant
and
despairing
that
he
was
afraid
of
her
what
is
it
i
conjure
you
louisa
tell
me
what
is
the
she
dropped
into
a
chair
before
him
and
put
her
cold
hand
on
his
arm
father
you
have
trained
me
from
my
cradle
yes
i
curse
the
hour
in
which
i
was
born
to
such
a
he
looked
at
her
in
doubt
and
dread
vacantly
repeating
curse
the
hour
curse
the
hour
how
could
you
give
me
life
and
take
from
me
all
the
inappreciable
things
that
raise
it
from
the
state
of
conscious
death
where
are
the
graces
of
my
soul
where
are
the
sentiments
of
my
heart
what
have
you
done
o
father
what
have
you
done
with
the
garden
that
should
have
bloomed
once
in
this
great
wilderness
here
she
struck
herself
with
both
her
hands
upon
her
bosom
if
it
had
ever
been
here
its
ashes
alone
would
save
me
from
the
void
in
which
my
whole
life
sinks
i
did
not
mean
to
say
this
but
father
you
remember
the
last
time
we
conversed
in
this
room
he
had
been
so
wholly
unprepared
for
what
he
heard
now
that
it
was
with
difficulty
he
answered
yes
what
has
risen
to
my
lips
now
would
have
risen
to
my
lips
then
if
you
had
given
me
a
moment
s
help
i
don
t
reproach
you
father
what
you
have
never
nurtured
in
me
you
have
never
nurtured
in
yourself
but
o
if
you
had
only
done
so
long
ago
or
if
you
had
only
neglected
me
what
a
much
better
and
much
happier
creature
i
should
have
been
this
day
on
hearing
this
after
all
his
care
he
bowed
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
groaned
aloud
father
if
you
had
known
when
we
were
last
together
here
what
even
i
feared
while
i
strove
against
it
has
been
my
task
from
infancy
to
strive
against
every
natural
prompting
that
has
arisen
in
my
heart
if
you
had
known
that
there
lingered
in
my
breast
sensibilities
affections
weaknesses
capable
of
being
cherished
into
strength
defying
all
the
calculations
ever
made
by
man
and
no
more
known
to
his
arithmetic
than
his
creator
is
you
have
given
me
to
the
husband
whom
i
am
now
sure
that
i
hate
he
said
no
no
my
poor
would
you
have
doomed
me
at
any
time
to
the
frost
and
blight
that
have
hardened
and
spoiled
me
would
you
have
robbed
no
one
s
for
the
greater
desolation
of
this
the
immaterial
part
of
my
life
the
spring
and
summer
of
my
belief
my
refuge
from
what
is
sordid
and
bad
in
the
real
things
around
me
my
school
in
which
i
should
have
learned
to
be
more
humble
and
more
trusting
with
them
and
to
hope
in
my
little
sphere
to
make
them
better
o
no
no
no
yet
father
if
i
had
been
stone
blind
if
i
had
groped
my
way
by
my
sense
of
touch
and
had
been
free
while
i
knew
the
shapes
and
surfaces
of
things
to
exercise
my
fancy
somewhat
in
regard
to
them
i
should
have
been
a
million
times
wiser
happier
more
loving
more
contented
more
innocent
and
human
in
all
good
respects
than
i
am
with
the
eyes
i
have
now
hear
what
i
have
come
to
he
moved
to
support
her
with
his
arm
she
rising
as
he
did
so
they
stood
close
together
she
with
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
looking
fixedly
in
his
face
with
a
hunger
and
thirst
upon
me
father
which
have
never
been
for
a
moment
appeased
with
an
ardent
impulse
towards
some
region
where
rules
and
figures
and
definitions
were
not
quite
absolute
i
have
grown
up
battling
every
inch
of
my
i
never
knew
you
were
unhappy
my
father
i
always
knew
it
in
this
strife
i
have
almost
repulsed
and
crushed
my
better
angel
into
a
demon
what
i
have
learned
has
left
me
doubting
misbelieving
despising
regretting
what
i
have
not
learned
and
my
dismal
resource
has
been
to
think
that
life
would
soon
go
by
and
that
nothing
in
it
could
be
worth
the
pain
and
trouble
of
a
and
you
so
young
louisa
he
said
with
pity
and
i
so
young
in
this
condition
i
show
you
now
without
fear
or
favour
the
ordinary
deadened
state
of
my
mind
as
i
know
proposed
my
husband
to
me
i
took
him
i
never
made
a
pretence
to
him
or
you
that
i
loved
him
i
knew
and
father
you
knew
and
he
knew
that
i
never
did
i
was
not
wholly
indifferent
for
i
had
a
hope
of
being
pleasant
and
useful
to
tom
i
made
that
wild
escape
into
something
visionary
and
have
slowly
found
out
how
wild
it
was
but
tom
had
been
the
subject
of
all
the
little
tenderness
of
my
life
perhaps
he
became
so
because
i
knew
so
well
how
to
pity
him
it
matters
little
now
except
as
it
may
dispose
you
to
think
more
leniently
of
his
as
her
father
held
her
in
his
arms
she
put
her
other
hand
upon
his
other
shoulder
and
still
looking
fixedly
in
his
face
went
on
when
i
was
irrevocably
married
there
rose
up
into
rebellion
against
the
tie
the
old
strife
made
fiercer
by
all
those
causes
of
disparity
which
arise
out
of
our
two
individual
natures
and
which
no
general
laws
shall
ever
rule
or
state
for
me
father
until
they
shall
be
able
to
direct
the
anatomist
where
to
strike
his
knife
into
the
secrets
of
my
louisa
he
said
and
said
imploringly
for
he
well
remembered
what
had
passed
between
them
in
their
former
interview
i
do
not
reproach
you
father
i
make
no
complaint
i
am
here
with
another
what
can
i
do
child
ask
me
what
you
i
am
coming
to
it
father
chance
then
threw
into
my
way
a
new
acquaintance
a
man
such
as
i
had
had
no
experience
of
used
to
the
world
light
polished
easy
making
no
pretences
avowing
the
low
estimate
of
everything
that
i
was
half
afraid
to
form
in
secret
conveying
to
me
almost
immediately
though
i
don
t
know
how
or
by
what
degrees
that
he
understood
me
and
read
my
thoughts
i
could
not
find
that
he
was
worse
than
i
there
seemed
to
be
a
near
affinity
between
us
i
only
wondered
it
should
be
worth
his
while
who
cared
for
nothing
else
to
care
so
much
for
for
you
louisa
her
father
might
instinctively
have
loosened
his
hold
but
that
he
felt
her
strength
departing
from
her
and
saw
a
wild
dilating
fire
in
the
eyes
steadfastly
regarding
him
i
say
nothing
of
his
plea
for
claiming
my
confidence
it
matters
very
little
how
he
gained
it
father
he
did
gain
it
what
you
know
of
the
story
of
my
marriage
he
soon
knew
just
as
her
father
s
face
was
ashy
white
and
he
held
her
in
both
his
arms
i
have
done
no
worse
i
have
not
disgraced
you
but
if
you
ask
me
whether
i
have
loved
him
or
do
love
him
i
tell
you
plainly
father
that
it
may
be
so
i
don
t
she
took
her
hands
suddenly
from
his
shoulders
and
pressed
them
both
upon
her
side
while
in
her
face
not
like
in
her
figure
drawn
up
resolute
to
finish
by
a
last
effort
what
she
had
to
feelings
long
suppressed
broke
loose
this
night
my
husband
being
away
he
has
been
with
me
declaring
himself
my
lover
this
minute
he
expects
me
for
i
could
release
myself
of
his
presence
by
no
other
means
i
do
not
know
that
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
know
that
i
am
ashamed
i
do
not
know
that
i
am
degraded
in
my
own
esteem
all
that
i
know
is
your
philosophy
and
your
teaching
will
not
save
me
now
father
you
have
brought
me
to
this
save
me
by
some
other
means
he
tightened
his
hold
in
time
to
prevent
her
sinking
on
the
floor
but
she
cried
out
in
a
terrible
voice
i
shall
die
if
you
hold
me
let
me
fall
upon
the
ground
and
he
laid
her
down
there
and
saw
the
pride
of
his
heart
and
the
triumph
of
his
system
lying
an
insensible
heap
at
his
feet
end
of
the
second
book
book
the
third
chapter
i
another
thing
needful
louisa
awoke
from
a
torpor
and
her
eyes
languidly
opened
on
her
old
bed
at
home
and
her
old
room
it
seemed
at
first
as
if
all
that
had
happened
since
the
days
when
these
objects
were
familiar
to
her
were
the
shadows
of
a
dream
but
gradually
as
the
objects
became
more
real
to
her
sight
the
events
became
more
real
to
her
mind
she
could
scarcely
move
her
head
for
pain
and
heaviness
her
eyes
were
strained
and
sore
and
she
was
very
weak
a
curious
passive
inattention
had
such
possession
of
her
that
the
presence
of
her
little
sister
in
the
room
did
not
attract
her
notice
for
some
time
even
when
their
eyes
had
met
and
her
sister
had
approached
the
bed
louisa
lay
for
minutes
looking
at
her
in
silence
and
suffering
her
timidly
to
hold
her
passive
hand
before
she
asked
when
was
i
brought
to
this
room
last
night
who
brought
me
here
sissy
i
why
do
you
believe
so
because
i
found
her
here
this
morning
she
didn
t
come
to
my
bedside
to
wake
me
as
she
always
does
and
i
went
to
look
for
her
she
was
not
in
her
own
room
either
and
i
went
looking
for
her
all
over
the
house
until
i
found
her
here
taking
care
of
you
and
cooling
your
head
will
you
see
father
sissy
said
i
was
to
tell
him
when
you
what
a
beaming
face
you
have
jane
said
louisa
as
her
young
down
to
kiss
her
have
i
i
am
very
glad
you
think
so
i
am
sure
it
must
be
sissy
s
the
arm
louisa
had
begun
to
twine
around
her
neck
unbent
itself
you
can
tell
father
if
you
then
staying
her
for
a
moment
she
said
it
was
you
who
made
my
room
so
cheerful
and
gave
it
this
look
of
welcome
oh
no
louisa
it
was
done
before
i
came
it
louisa
turned
upon
her
pillow
and
heard
no
more
when
her
sister
had
withdrawn
she
turned
her
head
back
again
and
lay
with
her
face
towards
the
door
until
it
opened
and
her
father
entered
he
had
a
jaded
anxious
look
upon
him
and
his
hand
usually
steady
trembled
in
hers
he
sat
down
at
the
side
of
the
bed
tenderly
asking
how
she
was
and
dwelling
on
the
necessity
of
her
keeping
very
quiet
after
her
agitation
and
exposure
to
the
weather
last
night
he
spoke
in
a
subdued
and
troubled
voice
very
different
from
his
usual
dictatorial
manner
and
was
often
at
a
loss
for
words
my
dear
louisa
my
poor
he
was
so
much
at
a
loss
at
that
place
that
he
stopped
altogether
he
tried
again
my
unfortunate
the
place
was
so
difficult
to
get
over
that
he
tried
again
it
would
be
hopeless
for
me
louisa
to
endeavour
to
tell
you
how
overwhelmed
i
have
been
and
still
am
by
what
broke
upon
me
last
night
the
ground
on
which
i
stand
has
ceased
to
be
solid
under
my
feet
the
only
support
on
which
i
leaned
and
the
strength
of
which
it
seemed
and
still
does
seem
impossible
to
question
has
given
way
in
an
instant
i
am
stunned
by
these
discoveries
i
have
no
selfish
meaning
in
what
i
say
but
i
find
the
shock
of
what
broke
upon
me
last
night
to
be
very
heavy
she
could
give
him
no
comfort
herein
she
had
suffered
the
wreck
of
her
whole
life
upon
the
rock
i
will
not
say
louisa
that
if
you
had
by
any
happy
chance
undeceived
me
some
time
ago
it
would
have
been
better
for
us
both
better
for
your
peace
and
better
for
mine
for
i
am
sensible
that
it
may
not
have
been
a
part
of
my
system
to
invite
any
confidence
of
that
kind
i
had
proved
system
to
myself
and
i
have
rigidly
administered
it
and
i
must
bear
the
responsibility
of
its
failures
i
only
entreat
you
to
believe
my
favourite
child
that
i
have
meant
to
do
he
said
it
earnestly
and
to
do
him
justice
he
had
in
gauging
fathomless
deeps
with
his
little
mean
and
in
staggering
over
the
universe
with
his
rusty
compasses
he
had
meant
to
do
great
things
within
the
limits
of
his
short
tether
he
had
tumbled
about
annihilating
the
flowers
of
existence
with
greater
singleness
of
purpose
than
many
of
the
blatant
personages
whose
company
he
kept
i
am
well
assured
of
what
you
say
father
i
know
i
have
been
your
favourite
child
i
know
you
have
intended
to
make
me
happy
i
have
never
blamed
you
and
i
never
he
took
her
outstretched
hand
and
retained
it
in
his
my
dear
i
have
remained
all
night
at
my
table
pondering
again
and
again
on
what
has
so
painfully
passed
between
us
when
i
consider
your
character
when
i
consider
that
what
has
been
known
to
me
for
hours
has
been
concealed
by
you
for
years
when
i
consider
under
what
immediate
pressure
it
has
been
forced
from
you
at
last
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
can
not
but
mistrust
he
might
have
added
more
than
all
when
he
saw
the
face
now
looking
at
him
he
did
add
it
in
effect
perhaps
as
he
softly
moved
her
scattered
hair
from
her
forehead
with
his
hand
such
little
actions
slight
in
another
man
were
very
noticeable
in
him
and
his
daughter
received
them
as
if
they
had
been
words
of
contrition
but
said
gradgrind
slowly
and
with
hesitation
as
well
as
with
a
wretched
sense
of
happiness
if
i
see
reason
to
mistrust
myself
for
the
past
louisa
i
should
also
mistrust
myself
for
the
present
and
the
future
to
speak
unreservedly
to
you
i
do
i
am
far
from
feeling
convinced
now
however
differently
i
might
have
felt
only
this
time
yesterday
that
i
am
fit
for
the
trust
you
repose
in
me
that
i
know
how
to
respond
to
the
appeal
you
have
come
home
to
make
to
me
that
i
have
the
right
it
for
the
moment
to
be
some
quality
of
that
to
help
you
and
to
set
you
right
my
she
had
turned
upon
her
pillow
and
lay
with
her
face
upon
her
arm
so
that
he
could
not
see
it
all
her
wildness
and
passion
had
subsided
but
though
softened
she
was
not
in
tears
her
father
was
changed
in
nothing
so
much
as
in
the
respect
that
he
would
have
been
glad
to
see
her
in
tears
some
persons
hold
he
pursued
still
hesitating
that
there
is
a
wisdom
of
the
head
and
that
there
is
a
wisdom
of
the
heart
i
have
not
supposed
so
but
as
i
have
said
i
mistrust
myself
now
i
have
supposed
the
head
to
be
it
may
not
be
how
can
i
venture
this
morning
to
say
it
is
if
that
other
kind
of
wisdom
should
be
what
i
have
neglected
and
should
be
the
instinct
that
is
wanted
he
suggested
it
very
doubtfully
as
if
he
were
half
unwilling
to
admit
it
even
now
she
made
him
no
answer
lying
before
him
on
her
bed
still
much
as
he
had
seen
her
lying
on
the
floor
of
his
room
last
night
louisa
and
his
hand
rested
on
her
hair
again
i
have
been
absent
from
here
my
dear
a
good
deal
of
late
and
though
your
sister
s
training
has
been
pursued
according
system
he
appeared
to
come
to
that
word
with
great
reluctance
always
it
has
necessarily
been
modified
by
daily
associations
begun
in
her
case
at
an
early
age
i
ask
and
humbly
my
the
better
do
you
think
father
she
replied
without
stirring
if
any
harmony
has
been
awakened
in
her
young
breast
that
was
mute
in
mine
until
it
turned
to
discord
let
her
thank
heaven
for
it
and
go
upon
her
happier
way
taking
it
as
her
greatest
blessing
that
she
has
avoided
my
o
my
child
my
child
he
said
in
a
forlorn
manner
i
am
an
unhappy
man
to
see
you
thus
what
avails
it
to
me
that
you
do
not
reproach
me
if
i
so
bitterly
reproach
myself
he
bent
his
head
and
spoke
low
to
her
louisa
i
have
a
misgiving
that
some
change
may
have
been
slowly
working
about
me
in
this
house
by
mere
love
and
gratitude
that
what
the
head
had
left
undone
and
could
not
do
the
heart
may
have
been
doing
silently
can
it
be
so
she
made
him
no
reply
i
am
not
too
proud
to
believe
it
louisa
how
could
i
be
arrogant
and
you
before
me
can
it
be
so
is
it
so
my
dear
he
looked
upon
her
once
more
lying
cast
away
there
and
without
another
word
went
out
of
the
room
he
had
not
been
long
gone
when
she
heard
a
light
tread
near
the
door
and
knew
that
some
one
stood
beside
her
she
did
not
raise
her
head
a
dull
anger
that
she
should
be
seen
in
her
distress
and
that
the
involuntary
look
she
had
so
resented
should
come
to
this
fulfilment
smouldered
within
her
like
an
unwholesome
fire
all
closely
imprisoned
forces
rend
and
destroy
the
air
that
would
be
healthful
to
the
earth
the
water
that
would
enrich
it
the
heat
that
would
ripen
it
tear
it
when
caged
up
so
in
her
bosom
even
now
the
strongest
qualities
she
possessed
long
turned
upon
themselves
became
a
heap
of
obduracy
that
rose
against
a
friend
it
was
well
that
soft
touch
came
upon
her
neck
and
that
she
understood
herself
to
be
supposed
to
have
fallen
asleep
the
sympathetic
hand
did
not
claim
her
resentment
let
it
lie
there
let
it
lie
it
lay
there
warming
into
life
a
crowd
of
gentler
thoughts
and
she
rested
as
she
softened
with
the
quiet
and
the
consciousness
of
being
so
watched
some
tears
made
their
way
into
her
eyes
the
face
touched
hers
and
she
knew
that
there
were
tears
upon
it
too
and
she
the
cause
of
them
as
louisa
feigned
to
rouse
herself
and
sat
up
sissy
retired
so
that
she
stood
placidly
near
the
bedside
i
hope
i
have
not
disturbed
you
i
have
come
to
ask
if
you
would
let
me
stay
with
you
why
should
you
stay
with
me
my
sister
will
miss
you
you
are
everything
to
am
i
returned
sissy
shaking
her
head
i
would
be
something
to
you
if
i
what
said
louisa
almost
sternly
whatever
you
want
most
if
i
could
be
that
at
all
events
i
would
like
to
try
to
be
as
near
it
as
i
can
and
however
far
off
that
may
be
i
will
never
tire
of
trying
will
you
let
me
my
father
sent
you
to
ask
no
indeed
replied
sissy
he
told
me
that
i
might
come
in
now
but
he
sent
me
away
from
the
room
this
at
she
hesitated
and
stopped
at
least
what
said
louisa
with
her
searching
eyes
upon
her
i
thought
it
best
myself
that
i
should
be
sent
away
for
i
felt
very
uncertain
whether
you
would
like
to
find
me
have
i
always
hated
you
so
much
i
hope
not
for
i
have
always
loved
you
and
have
always
wished
that
you
should
know
it
but
you
changed
to
me
a
little
shortly
before
you
left
home
not
that
i
wondered
at
it
you
knew
so
much
and
i
knew
so
little
and
it
was
so
natural
in
many
ways
going
as
you
were
among
other
friends
that
i
had
nothing
to
complain
of
and
was
not
at
all
her
colour
rose
as
she
said
it
modestly
and
hurriedly
louisa
understood
the
loving
pretence
and
her
heart
smote
her
may
i
try
said
sissy
emboldened
to
raise
her
hand
to
the
neck
that
was
insensibly
drooping
towards
her
louisa
taking
down
the
hand
that
would
have
embraced
her
in
another
moment
held
it
in
one
of
hers
and
answered
first
sissy
do
you
know
what
i
am
i
am
so
proud
and
so
hardened
so
confused
and
troubled
so
resentful
and
unjust
to
every
one
and
to
myself
that
everything
is
stormy
dark
and
wicked
to
me
does
not
that
repel
you
no
i
am
so
unhappy
and
all
that
should
have
made
me
otherwise
is
so
laid
waste
that
if
i
had
been
bereft
of
sense
to
this
hour
and
instead
of
being
as
learned
as
you
think
me
had
to
begin
to
acquire
the
simplest
truths
i
could
not
want
a
guide
to
peace
contentment
honour
all
the
good
of
which
i
am
quite
devoid
more
abjectly
than
i
do
does
not
that
repel
you
no
in
the
innocence
of
her
brave
affection
and
the
brimming
up
of
her
old
devoted
spirit
the
once
deserted
girl
shone
like
a
beautiful
light
upon
the
darkness
of
the
other
louisa
raised
the
hand
that
it
might
clasp
her
neck
and
join
its
fellow
there
she
fell
upon
her
knees
and
clinging
to
this
stroller
s
child
looked
up
at
her
almost
with
veneration
forgive
me
pity
me
help
me
have
compassion
on
my
great
need
and
let
me
lay
this
head
of
mine
upon
a
loving
heart
o
lay
it
here
cried
sissy
lay
it
here
my
chapter
ii
very
ridiculous
james
harthouse
passed
a
whole
night
and
a
day
in
a
state
of
so
much
hurry
that
the
world
with
its
best
glass
in
his
eye
would
scarcely
have
recognized
him
during
that
insane
interval
as
the
brother
jem
of
the
honourable
and
jocular
member
he
was
positively
agitated
he
several
times
spoke
with
an
emphasis
similar
to
the
vulgar
manner
he
went
in
and
went
out
in
an
unaccountable
way
like
a
man
without
an
object
he
rode
like
a
highwayman
in
a
word
he
was
so
horribly
bored
by
existing
circumstances
that
he
forgot
to
go
in
for
boredom
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
the
authorities
after
putting
his
horse
at
coketown
through
the
storm
as
if
it
were
a
leap
he
waited
up
all
night
from
time
to
time
ringing
his
bell
with
the
greatest
fury
charging
the
porter
who
kept
watch
with
delinquency
in
withholding
letters
or
messages
that
could
not
fail
to
have
been
entrusted
to
him
and
demanding
restitution
on
the
spot
the
dawn
coming
the
morning
coming
and
the
day
coming
and
neither
message
nor
letter
coming
with
either
he
went
down
to
the
country
house
there
the
report
was
bounderby
away
and
bounderby
in
town
left
for
town
suddenly
last
evening
not
even
known
to
be
gone
until
receipt
of
message
importing
that
her
return
was
not
to
be
expected
for
the
present
in
these
circumstances
he
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
follow
her
to
town
he
went
to
the
house
in
town
bounderby
not
there
he
looked
in
at
the
bank
bounderby
away
and
sparsit
away
sparsit
away
who
could
have
been
reduced
to
sudden
extremity
for
the
company
of
that
griffin
well
i
don
t
know
said
tom
who
had
his
own
reasons
for
being
uneasy
about
it
she
was
off
somewhere
at
daybreak
this
morning
she
s
always
full
of
mystery
i
hate
her
so
i
do
that
white
chap
he
s
always
got
his
blinking
eyes
upon
a
where
were
you
last
night
tom
where
was
i
last
night
said
tom
come
i
like
that
i
was
waiting
for
you
harthouse
till
it
came
down
as
never
saw
it
come
down
before
where
was
i
too
where
were
you
you
i
was
prevented
from
detained
murmured
tom
two
of
us
were
detained
i
was
detained
looking
for
you
till
i
lost
every
train
but
the
mail
it
would
have
been
a
pleasant
job
to
go
down
by
that
on
such
a
night
and
have
to
walk
home
through
a
pond
i
was
obliged
to
sleep
in
town
after
where
where
why
in
my
own
bed
at
bounderby
did
you
see
your
sister
how
the
deuce
returned
tom
staring
could
i
see
my
sister
when
she
was
fifteen
miles
off
cursing
these
quick
retorts
of
the
young
gentleman
to
whom
he
was
so
true
a
friend
harthouse
disembarrassed
himself
of
that
interview
with
the
smallest
conceivable
amount
of
ceremony
and
debated
for
the
hundredth
time
what
all
this
could
mean
he
made
only
one
thing
clear
it
was
that
whether
she
was
in
town
or
out
of
town
whether
he
had
been
premature
with
her
who
was
so
hard
to
comprehend
or
she
had
lost
courage
or
they
were
discovered
or
some
mischance
or
mistake
at
present
incomprehensible
had
occurred
he
must
remain
to
confront
his
fortune
whatever
it
was
the
hotel
where
he
was
known
to
live
when
condemned
to
that
region
of
blackness
was
the
stake
to
which
he
was
tied
as
to
all
the
will
be
will
be
so
whether
i
am
waiting
for
a
hostile
message
or
an
assignation
or
a
penitent
remonstrance
or
an
impromptu
wrestle
with
my
friend
bounderby
in
the
lancashire
would
seem
as
likely
as
anything
else
in
the
present
state
of
ll
dine
said
james
harthouse
bounderby
has
the
advantage
in
point
of
weight
and
if
anything
of
a
british
nature
is
to
come
off
between
us
it
may
be
as
well
to
be
in
therefore
he
rang
the
bell
and
tossing
himself
negligently
on
a
sofa
ordered
some
dinner
at
a
beefsteak
in
it
and
got
through
the
intervening
time
as
well
as
he
could
that
was
not
particularly
well
for
he
remained
in
the
greatest
perplexity
and
as
the
hours
went
on
and
no
kind
of
explanation
offered
itself
his
perplexity
augmented
at
compound
interest
however
he
took
affairs
as
coolly
as
it
was
in
human
nature
to
do
and
entertained
himself
with
the
facetious
idea
of
the
training
more
than
once
it
wouldn
t
be
bad
he
yawned
at
one
time
to
give
the
waiter
five
shillings
and
throw
at
another
time
it
occurred
to
him
or
a
fellow
of
about
thirteen
or
fourteen
stone
might
be
hired
by
the
but
these
jests
did
not
tell
materially
on
the
afternoon
or
his
suspense
and
sooth
to
say
they
both
lagged
fearfully
it
was
impossible
even
before
dinner
to
avoid
often
walking
about
in
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
looking
out
of
the
window
listening
at
the
door
for
footsteps
and
occasionally
becoming
rather
hot
when
any
steps
approached
that
room
but
after
dinner
when
the
day
turned
to
twilight
and
the
twilight
turned
to
night
and
still
no
communication
was
made
to
him
it
began
to
be
as
he
expressed
it
like
the
holy
office
and
slow
however
still
true
to
his
conviction
that
indifference
was
the
genuine
the
only
conviction
he
had
he
seized
this
crisis
as
the
opportunity
for
ordering
candles
and
a
newspaper
he
had
been
trying
in
vain
for
half
an
hour
to
read
this
newspaper
when
the
waiter
appeared
and
said
at
once
mysteriously
and
apologetically
beg
your
pardon
sir
you
re
wanted
sir
if
you
a
general
recollection
that
this
was
the
kind
of
thing
the
police
said
to
the
swell
mob
caused
harthouse
to
ask
the
waiter
in
return
with
bristling
indignation
what
the
devil
he
meant
by
wanted
beg
your
pardon
sir
young
lady
outside
sir
wishes
to
see
outside
where
outside
this
door
giving
the
waiter
to
the
personage
before
mentioned
as
a
duly
qualified
for
that
consignment
harthouse
hurried
into
the
gallery
a
young
woman
whom
he
had
never
seen
stood
there
plainly
dressed
very
quiet
very
pretty
as
he
conducted
her
into
the
room
and
placed
a
chair
for
her
he
observed
by
the
light
of
the
candles
that
she
was
even
prettier
than
he
had
at
first
believed
her
face
was
innocent
and
youthful
and
its
expression
remarkably
pleasant
she
was
not
afraid
of
him
or
in
any
way
disconcerted
she
seemed
to
have
her
mind
entirely
preoccupied
with
the
occasion
of
her
visit
and
to
have
substituted
that
consideration
for
herself
i
speak
to
harthouse
she
said
when
they
were
alone
to
he
added
in
his
mind
and
you
speak
to
him
with
the
most
confiding
eyes
i
ever
saw
and
the
most
earnest
voice
though
so
quiet
i
ever
if
i
do
not
i
do
not
sir
sissy
what
your
honour
as
a
gentleman
binds
you
to
in
other
matters
the
blood
really
rose
in
his
face
as
she
began
in
these
words
i
am
sure
i
may
rely
upon
it
to
keep
my
visit
secret
and
to
keep
secret
what
i
am
going
to
say
i
will
rely
upon
it
if
you
will
tell
me
i
may
so
far
you
may
i
assure
i
am
young
as
you
see
i
am
alone
as
you
see
in
coming
to
you
sir
i
have
no
advice
or
encouragement
beyond
my
own
he
thought
but
that
is
very
strong
as
he
followed
the
momentary
upward
glance
of
her
eyes
he
thought
besides
this
is
a
very
odd
beginning
i
don
t
see
where
we
are
i
think
said
sissy
you
have
already
guessed
whom
i
left
just
now
i
have
been
in
the
greatest
concern
and
uneasiness
during
the
last
hours
which
have
appeared
as
many
years
he
returned
on
a
lady
s
account
the
hopes
i
have
been
encouraged
to
form
that
you
come
from
that
lady
do
not
deceive
me
i
i
left
her
within
an
at
her
father
harthouse
s
face
lengthened
in
spite
of
his
coolness
and
his
perplexity
increased
then
i
certainly
he
thought
do
see
where
we
are
she
hurried
there
last
night
she
arrived
there
in
great
agitation
and
was
insensible
all
through
the
night
i
live
at
her
father
s
and
was
with
her
you
may
be
sure
sir
you
will
never
see
her
again
as
long
as
you
harthouse
drew
a
long
breath
and
if
ever
man
found
himself
in
the
position
of
not
knowing
what
to
say
made
the
discovery
beyond
all
question
that
he
was
so
circumstanced
the
ingenuousness
with
which
his
visitor
spoke
her
modest
fearlessness
her
truthfulness
which
put
all
artifice
aside
her
entire
forgetfulness
of
herself
in
her
earnest
quiet
holding
to
the
object
with
which
she
had
come
all
this
together
with
her
reliance
on
his
easily
given
in
itself
shamed
something
in
which
he
was
so
inexperienced
and
against
which
he
knew
any
of
his
usual
weapons
would
fall
so
powerless
that
not
a
word
could
he
rally
to
his
relief
at
last
he
said
so
startling
an
announcement
so
confidently
made
and
by
such
lips
is
really
disconcerting
in
the
last
degree
may
i
be
permitted
to
inquire
if
you
are
charged
to
convey
that
information
to
me
in
those
hopeless
words
by
the
lady
of
whom
we
speak
i
have
no
charge
from
the
drowning
man
catches
at
the
straw
with
no
disrespect
for
your
judgment
and
with
no
doubt
of
your
sincerity
excuse
my
saying
that
i
cling
to
the
belief
that
there
is
yet
hope
that
i
am
not
condemned
to
perpetual
exile
from
that
lady
s
there
is
not
the
least
hope
the
first
object
of
my
coming
here
sir
is
to
assure
you
that
you
must
believe
that
there
is
no
more
hope
of
your
ever
speaking
with
her
again
than
there
would
be
if
she
had
died
when
she
came
home
last
must
believe
but
if
i
can
if
i
should
by
infirmity
of
nature
be
won
it
is
still
true
there
is
no
james
harthouse
looked
at
her
with
an
incredulous
smile
upon
his
lips
but
her
mind
looked
over
and
beyond
him
and
the
smile
was
quite
thrown
away
he
bit
his
lip
and
took
a
little
time
for
consideration
well
if
it
should
unhappily
appear
he
said
after
due
pains
and
duty
on
my
part
that
i
am
brought
to
a
position
so
desolate
as
this
banishment
i
shall
not
become
the
lady
s
persecutor
but
you
said
you
had
no
commission
from
her
i
have
only
the
commission
of
my
love
for
her
and
her
love
for
me
i
have
no
other
trust
than
that
i
have
been
with
her
since
she
came
home
and
that
she
has
given
me
her
confidence
i
have
no
further
trust
than
that
i
know
something
of
her
character
and
her
marriage
o
harthouse
i
think
you
had
that
trust
too
he
was
touched
in
the
cavity
where
his
heart
should
have
that
nest
of
addled
eggs
where
the
birds
of
heaven
would
have
lived
if
they
had
not
been
whistled
the
fervour
of
this
reproach
i
am
not
a
moral
sort
of
fellow
he
said
and
i
never
make
any
pretensions
to
the
character
of
a
moral
sort
of
fellow
i
am
as
immoral
as
need
be
at
the
same
time
in
bringing
any
distress
upon
the
lady
who
is
the
subject
of
the
present
conversation
or
in
unfortunately
compromising
her
in
any
way
or
in
committing
myself
by
any
expression
of
sentiments
towards
her
not
perfectly
reconcilable
fact
domestic
hearth
or
in
taking
any
advantage
of
her
father
s
being
a
machine
or
of
her
brother
s
being
a
whelp
or
of
her
husband
s
being
a
bear
i
beg
to
be
allowed
to
assure
you
that
i
have
had
no
particularly
evil
intentions
but
have
glided
on
from
one
step
to
another
with
a
smoothness
so
perfectly
diabolical
that
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
the
catalogue
was
half
so
long
until
i
began
to
turn
it
over
whereas
i
find
said
james
harthouse
in
conclusion
that
it
is
really
in
several
though
he
said
all
this
in
his
frivolous
way
the
way
seemed
for
that
once
a
conscious
polishing
of
but
an
ugly
surface
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
proceeded
with
a
more
air
though
with
traces
of
vexation
and
disappointment
that
would
not
be
polished
out
after
what
has
been
just
now
represented
to
me
in
a
manner
i
find
it
impossible
to
know
of
hardly
any
other
source
from
which
i
could
have
accepted
it
so
feel
bound
to
say
to
you
in
whom
the
confidence
you
have
mentioned
has
been
reposed
that
i
can
not
refuse
to
contemplate
the
possibility
however
unexpected
of
my
seeing
the
lady
no
more
i
am
solely
to
blame
for
the
thing
having
come
to
i
can
not
say
he
added
rather
hard
up
for
a
general
peroration
that
i
have
any
sanguine
expectation
of
ever
becoming
a
moral
sort
of
fellow
or
that
i
have
any
belief
in
any
moral
sort
of
fellow
sissy
s
face
sufficiently
showed
that
her
appeal
to
him
was
not
finished
you
spoke
he
resumed
as
she
raised
her
eyes
to
him
again
of
your
first
object
i
may
assume
that
there
is
a
second
to
be
mentioned
will
you
oblige
me
by
confiding
it
mr
harthouse
returned
sissy
with
a
blending
of
gentleness
and
steadiness
that
quite
defeated
him
and
with
a
simple
confidence
in
his
being
bound
to
do
what
she
required
that
held
him
at
a
singular
disadvantage
the
only
reparation
that
remains
with
you
is
to
leave
here
immediately
and
finally
i
am
quite
sure
that
you
can
mitigate
in
no
other
way
the
wrong
and
harm
you
have
done
i
am
quite
sure
that
it
is
the
only
compensation
you
have
left
it
in
your
power
to
make
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
much
or
that
it
is
enough
but
it
is
something
and
it
is
necessary
therefore
though
without
any
other
authority
than
i
have
given
you
and
even
without
the
knowledge
of
any
other
person
than
yourself
and
myself
i
ask
you
to
depart
from
this
place
under
an
obligation
never
to
return
to
if
she
had
asserted
any
influence
over
him
beyond
her
plain
faith
in
the
truth
and
right
of
what
she
said
if
she
had
concealed
the
least
doubt
or
irresolution
or
had
harboured
for
the
best
purpose
any
reserve
or
pretence
if
she
had
shown
or
felt
the
lightest
trace
of
any
sensitiveness
to
his
ridicule
or
his
astonishment
or
any
remonstrance
he
might
offer
he
would
have
carried
it
against
her
at
this
point
but
he
could
as
easily
have
changed
a
clear
sky
by
looking
at
it
in
surprise
as
affect
her
but
do
you
know
he
asked
quite
at
a
loss
the
extent
of
what
you
ask
you
probably
are
not
aware
that
i
am
here
on
a
public
kind
of
business
preposterous
enough
in
itself
but
which
i
have
gone
in
for
and
sworn
by
and
am
supposed
to
be
devoted
to
in
quite
a
desperate
manner
you
probably
are
not
aware
of
that
but
i
assure
you
it
s
the
it
had
no
effect
on
sissy
fact
or
no
fact
besides
which
said
harthouse
taking
a
turn
or
two
across
the
room
dubiously
it
s
so
alarmingly
absurd
it
would
make
a
man
so
ridiculous
after
going
in
for
these
fellows
to
back
out
in
such
an
incomprehensible
i
am
quite
sure
repeated
sissy
that
it
is
the
only
reparation
in
your
power
sir
i
am
quite
sure
or
i
would
not
have
come
he
glanced
at
her
face
and
walked
about
again
upon
my
soul
i
don
t
know
what
to
say
so
immensely
absurd
it
fell
to
his
lot
now
to
stipulate
for
secrecy
if
i
were
to
do
such
a
very
ridiculous
thing
he
said
stopping
again
presently
and
leaning
against
the
it
could
only
be
in
the
most
inviolable
i
will
trust
to
you
sir
returned
sissy
and
you
will
trust
to
his
leaning
against
the
reminded
him
of
the
night
with
the
whelp
it
was
the
and
somehow
he
felt
as
if
were
the
whelp
he
could
make
no
way
at
all
i
suppose
a
man
never
was
placed
in
a
more
ridiculous
position
he
said
after
looking
down
and
looking
up
and
laughing
and
frowning
and
walking
off
and
walking
back
again
but
i
see
no
way
out
of
it
what
will
be
will
be
will
be
i
suppose
i
must
take
off
myself
i
short
i
engage
to
do
sissy
rose
she
was
not
surprised
by
the
result
but
she
was
happy
in
it
and
her
face
beamed
brightly
you
will
permit
me
to
say
continued
james
harthouse
that
i
doubt
if
any
other
ambassador
or
ambassadress
could
have
addressed
me
with
the
same
success
i
must
not
only
regard
myself
as
being
in
a
very
ridiculous
position
but
as
being
vanquished
at
all
points
will
you
allow
me
the
privilege
of
remembering
my
enemy
s
name
name
said
the
ambassadress
the
only
name
i
could
possibly
care
to
know
sissy
pardon
my
curiosity
at
parting
related
to
the
family
i
am
only
a
poor
girl
returned
sissy
i
was
separated
from
my
was
only
a
taken
pity
on
by
gradgrind
i
have
lived
in
the
house
ever
she
was
gone
it
wanted
this
to
complete
the
defeat
said
james
harthouse
sinking
with
a
resigned
air
on
the
sofa
after
standing
transfixed
a
little
while
the
defeat
may
now
be
considered
perfectly
accomplished
only
a
poor
a
james
harthouse
made
nothing
james
harthouse
a
great
pyramid
of
the
great
pyramid
put
it
into
his
head
to
go
up
the
nile
he
took
a
pen
upon
the
instant
and
wrote
the
following
note
in
appropriate
hieroglyphics
to
his
brother
dear
jack
up
at
coketown
bored
out
of
the
place
and
going
in
for
camels
affectionately
jem
he
rang
the
bell
send
my
fellow
gone
to
bed
tell
him
to
get
up
and
pack
he
wrote
two
more
notes
one
to
bounderby
announcing
his
retirement
from
that
part
of
the
country
and
showing
where
he
would
be
found
for
the
next
fortnight
the
other
similar
in
effect
to
gradgrind
almost
as
soon
as
the
ink
was
dry
upon
their
superscriptions
he
had
left
the
tall
chimneys
of
coketown
behind
and
was
in
a
railway
carriage
tearing
and
glaring
over
the
dark
landscape
the
moral
sort
of
fellows
might
suppose
that
james
harthouse
derived
some
comfortable
reflections
afterwards
from
this
prompt
retreat
as
one
of
his
few
actions
that
made
any
amends
for
anything
and
as
a
token
to
himself
that
he
had
escaped
the
climax
of
a
very
bad
business
but
it
was
not
so
at
all
a
secret
sense
of
having
failed
and
been
dread
of
what
other
fellows
who
went
in
for
similar
sorts
of
things
would
say
at
his
expense
if
they
knew
oppressed
him
that
what
was
about
the
very
best
passage
in
his
life
was
the
one
of
all
others
he
would
not
have
owned
to
on
any
account
and
the
only
one
that
made
him
ashamed
of
himself
chapter
iii
very
decided
the
indefatigable
sparsit
with
a
violent
cold
upon
her
her
voice
reduced
to
a
whisper
and
her
stately
frame
so
racked
by
continual
sneezes
that
it
seemed
in
danger
of
dismemberment
gave
chase
to
her
patron
until
she
found
him
in
the
metropolis
and
there
majestically
sweeping
in
upon
him
at
his
hotel
in
james
s
street
exploded
the
combustibles
with
which
she
was
charged
and
blew
up
having
executed
her
mission
with
infinite
relish
this
woman
then
fainted
away
on
bounderby
s
bounderby
s
first
procedure
was
to
shake
sparsit
off
and
leave
her
to
progress
as
she
might
through
various
stages
of
suffering
on
the
floor
he
next
had
recourse
to
the
administration
of
potent
restoratives
such
as
screwing
the
patient
s
thumbs
smiting
her
hands
abundantly
watering
her
face
and
inserting
salt
in
her
mouth
when
these
attentions
had
recovered
her
which
they
speedily
did
he
hustled
her
into
a
fast
train
without
offering
any
other
refreshment
and
carried
her
back
to
coketown
more
dead
than
alive
regarded
as
a
classical
ruin
sparsit
was
an
interesting
spectacle
on
her
arrival
at
her
journey
s
end
but
considered
in
any
other
light
the
amount
of
damage
she
had
by
that
time
sustained
was
excessive
and
impaired
her
claims
to
admiration
utterly
heedless
of
the
wear
and
tear
of
her
clothes
and
constitution
and
adamant
to
her
pathetic
sneezes
bounderby
immediately
crammed
her
into
a
coach
and
bore
her
off
to
stone
lodge
now
tom
gradgrind
said
bounderby
bursting
into
his
s
room
late
at
night
here
s
a
lady
know
has
something
to
say
to
you
that
will
strike
you
you
have
missed
my
letter
exclaimed
gradgrind
surprised
by
the
apparition
missed
your
letter
sir
bawled
bounderby
the
present
time
is
no
time
for
letters
no
man
shall
talk
to
josiah
bounderby
of
coketown
about
letters
with
his
mind
in
the
state
it
s
in
bounderby
said
gradgrind
in
a
tone
of
temperate
remonstrance
i
speak
of
a
very
special
letter
i
have
written
to
you
in
reference
to
tom
gradgrind
replied
bounderby
knocking
the
flat
of
his
hand
several
times
with
great
vehemence
on
the
table
i
speak
of
a
very
special
messenger
that
has
come
to
me
in
reference
to
louisa
sparsit
ma
am
stand
forward
that
unfortunate
lady
hereupon
essaying
to
offer
testimony
without
any
voice
and
with
painful
gestures
expressive
of
an
inflamed
throat
became
so
aggravating
and
underwent
so
many
facial
contortions
that
bounderby
unable
to
bear
it
seized
her
by
the
arm
and
shook
her
if
you
can
t
get
it
out
ma
am
said
bounderby
leave
to
get
it
out
this
is
not
a
time
for
a
lady
however
highly
connected
to
be
totally
inaudible
and
seemingly
swallowing
marbles
tom
gradgrind
sparsit
latterly
found
herself
by
accident
in
a
situation
to
overhear
a
conversation
out
of
doors
between
your
daughter
and
your
precious
james
indeed
said
gradgrind
ah
indeed
cried
bounderby
and
in
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
its
tenor
bounderby
i
know
what
you
do
perhaps
said
bounderby
staring
with
all
his
might
at
his
so
quiet
and
assuasive
you
know
where
your
daughter
is
at
the
present
time
undoubtedly
she
is
here
my
dear
bounderby
let
me
beg
you
to
restrain
these
loud
on
all
accounts
louisa
is
here
the
moment
she
could
detach
herself
from
that
interview
with
the
person
of
whom
you
speak
and
whom
i
deeply
regret
to
have
been
the
means
of
introducing
to
you
louisa
hurried
here
for
protection
i
myself
had
not
been
at
home
many
hours
when
i
received
in
this
room
she
hurried
by
the
train
to
town
she
ran
from
town
to
this
house
through
a
raging
storm
and
presented
herself
before
me
in
a
state
of
distraction
of
course
she
has
remained
here
ever
since
let
me
entreat
you
for
your
own
sake
and
for
hers
to
be
more
bounderby
silently
gazed
about
him
for
some
moments
in
every
direction
except
sparsit
s
direction
and
then
abruptly
turning
upon
the
niece
of
lady
scadgers
said
to
that
wretched
woman
now
ma
am
we
shall
be
happy
to
hear
any
little
apology
you
may
think
proper
to
offer
for
going
about
the
country
at
express
pace
with
no
other
luggage
than
a
ma
am
sir
whispered
sparsit
my
nerves
are
at
present
too
much
shaken
and
my
health
is
at
present
too
much
impaired
in
your
service
to
admit
of
my
doing
more
than
taking
refuge
in
which
she
did
well
ma
am
said
bounderby
without
making
any
observation
to
you
that
may
not
be
made
with
propriety
to
a
woman
of
good
family
what
i
have
got
to
add
to
that
is
that
there
is
something
else
in
which
it
appears
to
me
you
may
take
refuge
namely
a
coach
and
the
coach
in
which
we
came
here
being
at
the
door
you
ll
allow
me
to
hand
you
down
to
it
and
pack
you
home
to
the
bank
where
the
best
course
for
you
to
pursue
will
be
to
put
your
feet
into
the
hottest
water
you
can
bear
and
take
a
glass
of
scalding
rum
and
butter
after
you
get
into
with
these
words
bounderby
extended
his
right
hand
to
the
weeping
lady
and
escorted
her
to
the
conveyance
in
question
shedding
many
plaintive
sneezes
by
the
way
he
soon
returned
alone
now
as
you
showed
me
in
your
face
tom
gradgrind
that
you
wanted
to
speak
to
me
he
resumed
here
i
am
but
i
am
not
in
a
very
agreeable
state
i
tell
you
plainly
not
relishing
this
business
even
as
it
is
and
not
considering
that
i
am
at
any
time
as
dutifully
and
submissively
treated
by
your
daughter
as
josiah
bounderby
of
coketown
ought
to
be
treated
by
his
wife
you
have
your
opinion
i
dare
say
and
i
have
mine
i
know
if
you
mean
to
say
anything
to
me
that
goes
against
this
candid
remark
you
had
better
let
it
gradgrind
it
will
be
observed
being
much
softened
bounderby
took
particular
pains
to
harden
himself
at
all
points
it
was
his
amiable
nature
my
dear
bounderby
gradgrind
began
in
reply
now
you
ll
excuse
me
said
bounderby
but
i
don
t
want
to
be
too
dear
that
to
start
with
when
i
begin
to
be
dear
to
a
man
i
generally
find
that
his
intention
is
to
come
over
me
i
am
not
speaking
to
you
politely
but
as
you
are
aware
i
am
polite
if
you
like
politeness
you
know
where
to
get
it
you
have
your
you
know
and
they
ll
serve
you
with
as
much
of
the
article
as
you
want
i
don
t
keep
it
bounderby
urged
gradgrind
we
are
all
liable
to
i
thought
you
couldn
t
make
em
interrupted
bounderby
perhaps
i
thought
so
but
i
say
we
are
all
liable
to
mistakes
and
i
should
feel
sensible
of
your
delicacy
and
grateful
for
it
if
you
would
spare
me
these
references
to
harthouse
i
shall
not
associate
him
in
our
conversation
with
your
intimacy
and
encouragement
pray
do
not
persist
in
connecting
him
with
i
never
mentioned
his
name
said
bounderby
well
well
returned
gradgrind
with
a
patient
even
a
submissive
air
and
he
sat
for
a
little
while
pondering
bounderby
i
see
reason
to
doubt
whether
we
have
ever
quite
understood
who
do
you
mean
by
we
let
me
say
i
then
he
returned
in
answer
to
the
coarsely
blurted
question
i
doubt
whether
i
have
understood
louisa
i
doubt
whether
i
have
been
quite
right
in
the
manner
of
her
there
you
hit
it
returned
bounderby
there
i
agree
with
you
you
have
found
it
out
at
last
have
you
education
i
ll
tell
you
what
education
be
tumbled
out
of
doors
neck
and
crop
and
put
upon
the
shortest
allowance
of
everything
except
blows
that
s
what
call
i
think
your
good
sense
will
perceive
gradgrind
remonstrated
in
all
humility
that
whatever
the
merits
of
such
a
system
may
be
it
would
be
difficult
of
general
application
to
i
don
t
see
it
at
all
sir
returned
the
obstinate
bounderby
well
sighed
gradgrind
we
will
not
enter
into
the
question
i
assure
you
i
have
no
desire
to
be
controversial
i
seek
to
repair
what
is
amiss
if
i
possibly
can
and
i
hope
you
will
assist
me
in
a
good
spirit
bounderby
for
i
have
been
very
much
i
don
t
understand
you
yet
said
bounderby
with
determined
obstinacy
and
therefore
i
won
t
make
any
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
my
dear
bounderby
gradgrind
proceeded
in
the
same
depressed
and
propitiatory
manner
i
appear
to
myself
to
have
become
better
informed
as
to
louisa
s
character
than
in
previous
years
the
enlightenment
has
been
painfully
forced
upon
me
and
the
discovery
is
not
mine
i
think
there
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
me
say
think
there
are
qualities
in
louisa
have
been
harshly
neglected
a
little
perverted
i
would
suggest
to
you
if
you
would
kindly
meet
me
in
a
timely
endeavour
to
leave
her
to
her
better
nature
for
a
to
encourage
it
to
develop
itself
by
tenderness
and
would
be
the
better
for
the
happiness
of
all
of
us
louisa
said
gradgrind
shading
his
face
with
his
hand
has
always
been
my
favourite
the
blustrous
bounderby
crimsoned
and
swelled
to
such
an
extent
on
hearing
these
words
that
he
seemed
to
be
and
probably
was
on
the
brink
of
a
fit
with
his
very
ears
a
bright
purple
shot
with
crimson
he
pent
up
his
indignation
however
and
said
you
d
like
to
keep
her
here
for
a
time
had
intended
to
recommend
my
dear
bounderby
that
you
should
allow
louisa
to
remain
here
on
a
visit
and
be
attended
by
sissy
i
mean
of
course
cecilia
jupe
who
understands
her
and
in
whom
she
i
gather
from
all
this
tom
gradgrind
said
bounderby
standing
up
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
that
you
are
of
opinion
that
there
s
what
people
call
some
incompatibility
between
loo
bounderby
and
i
fear
there
is
at
present
a
general
incompatibility
between
louisa
almost
all
the
relations
in
which
i
have
placed
her
was
her
father
s
sorrowful
reply
now
look
you
here
tom
gradgrind
said
bounderby
the
flushed
confronting
him
with
his
legs
wide
apart
his
hands
deeper
in
his
pockets
and
his
hair
like
a
hayfield
wherein
his
windy
anger
was
boisterous
you
have
said
your
say
i
am
going
to
say
mine
i
am
a
coketown
man
i
am
josiah
bounderby
of
coketown
i
know
the
bricks
of
this
town
and
i
know
the
works
of
this
town
and
i
know
the
chimneys
of
this
town
and
i
know
the
smoke
of
this
town
and
i
know
the
hands
of
this
town
i
know
em
all
pretty
well
they
re
real
when
a
man
tells
me
anything
about
imaginative
qualities
i
always
tell
that
man
whoever
he
is
that
i
know
what
he
means
he
means
turtle
soup
and
venison
with
a
gold
spoon
and
that
he
wants
to
be
set
up
with
a
coach
and
six
that
s
what
your
daughter
wants
since
you
are
of
opinion
that
she
ought
to
have
what
she
wants
i
recommend
you
to
provide
it
for
her
because
tom
gradgrind
she
will
never
have
it
from
bounderby
said
gradgrind
i
hoped
after
my
entreaty
you
would
have
taken
a
different
just
wait
a
bit
retorted
bounderby
you
have
said
your
say
i
believe
i
heard
you
out
hear
me
out
if
you
please
don
t
make
yourself
a
spectacle
of
unfairness
as
well
as
inconsistency
because
although
i
am
sorry
to
see
tom
gradgrind
reduced
to
his
present
position
i
should
be
doubly
sorry
to
see
him
brought
so
low
as
that
now
there
s
an
incompatibility
of
some
sort
or
another
i
am
given
to
understand
by
you
between
your
daughter
and
me
i
ll
give
to
understand
in
reply
to
that
that
there
unquestionably
is
an
incompatibility
of
the
first
be
summed
up
in
your
daughter
don
t
properly
know
her
husband
s
merits
and
is
not
impressed
with
such
a
sense
as
would
become
her
by
george
of
the
honour
of
his
alliance
that
s
plain
speaking
i
bounderby
urged
gradgrind
this
is
is
it
said
bounderby
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
because
when
tom
gradgrind
with
his
new
lights
tells
me
that
what
i
say
is
unreasonable
i
am
convinced
at
once
it
must
be
devilish
sensible
with
your
permission
i
am
going
on
you
know
my
origin
and
you
know
that
for
a
good
many
years
of
my
life
i
didn
t
want
a
in
consequence
of
not
having
a
shoe
yet
you
may
believe
or
not
as
you
think
proper
that
there
are
to
next
to
worship
the
ground
i
walk
he
discharged
this
like
a
rocket
at
his
s
head
whereas
your
daughter
proceeded
bounderby
is
far
from
being
a
born
lady
that
you
know
yourself
not
that
i
care
a
pinch
of
about
such
things
for
you
are
very
well
aware
i
don
t
but
that
such
is
the
fact
and
you
tom
gradgrind
can
t
change
it
why
do
i
say
this
not
i
fear
observed
gradgrind
in
a
low
voice
to
spare
hear
me
out
said
bounderby
and
refrain
from
cutting
in
till
your
turn
comes
round
i
say
this
because
highly
connected
females
have
been
astonished
to
see
the
way
in
which
your
daughter
has
conducted
herself
and
to
witness
her
insensibility
they
have
wondered
how
i
have
suffered
it
and
i
wonder
myself
now
and
i
won
t
suffer
bounderby
returned
gradgrind
rising
the
less
we
say
the
better
i
on
the
contrary
tom
gradgrind
the
more
we
say
the
better
i
think
that
is
the
consideration
checked
him
till
i
have
said
all
i
mean
to
say
and
then
i
don
t
care
how
soon
we
stop
i
come
to
a
question
that
may
shorten
the
business
what
do
you
mean
by
the
proposal
you
made
just
now
what
do
i
mean
bounderby
by
your
visiting
proposition
said
bounderby
with
an
inflexible
jerk
of
the
hayfield
i
mean
that
i
hope
you
may
be
induced
to
arrange
in
a
friendly
manner
for
allowing
louisa
a
period
of
repose
and
reflection
here
which
may
tend
to
a
gradual
alteration
for
the
better
in
many
to
a
softening
down
of
your
ideas
of
the
incompatibility
said
bounderby
if
you
put
it
in
those
what
made
you
think
of
this
said
bounderby
i
have
already
said
i
fear
louisa
has
not
been
understood
is
it
asking
too
much
bounderby
that
you
so
far
her
elder
should
aid
in
trying
to
set
her
right
you
have
accepted
a
great
charge
of
her
for
better
for
worse
bounderby
may
have
been
annoyed
by
the
repetition
of
his
own
words
to
stephen
blackpool
but
he
cut
the
quotation
short
with
an
angry
start
come
said
he
i
don
t
want
to
be
told
about
that
i
know
what
i
took
her
for
as
well
as
you
do
never
you
mind
what
i
took
her
for
that
s
my
look
i
was
merely
going
on
to
remark
bounderby
that
we
may
all
be
more
or
less
in
the
wrong
not
even
excepting
you
and
that
some
yielding
on
your
part
remembering
the
trust
you
have
accepted
may
not
only
be
an
act
of
true
kindness
but
perhaps
a
debt
incurred
towards
i
think
differently
blustered
bounderby
i
am
going
to
finish
this
business
according
to
my
own
opinions
now
i
don
t
want
to
make
a
quarrel
of
it
with
you
tom
gradgrind
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
don
t
think
it
would
be
worthy
of
my
reputation
to
quarrel
on
such
a
subject
as
to
your
he
may
take
himself
off
wherever
he
likes
best
if
he
falls
in
my
way
i
shall
tell
him
my
mind
if
he
don
t
fall
in
my
way
i
shan
t
for
it
won
t
be
worth
my
while
to
do
it
as
to
your
daughter
whom
i
made
loo
bounderby
and
might
have
done
better
by
leaving
loo
gradgrind
if
she
don
t
come
home
by
twelve
o
clock
at
noon
i
shall
understand
that
she
prefers
to
stay
away
and
i
shall
send
her
wearing
apparel
and
so
forth
over
here
and
you
ll
take
charge
of
her
for
the
future
what
i
shall
say
to
people
in
general
of
the
incompatibility
that
led
to
my
so
laying
down
the
law
will
be
this
i
am
josiah
bounderby
and
i
had
my
she
s
the
daughter
of
tom
gradgrind
and
she
had
her
and
the
two
horses
wouldn
t
pull
together
i
am
pretty
well
known
to
be
rather
an
uncommon
man
i
believe
and
most
people
will
understand
fast
enough
that
it
must
be
a
woman
rather
out
of
the
common
also
who
in
the
long
run
would
come
up
to
my
let
me
seriously
entreat
you
to
reconsider
this
bounderby
urged
gradgrind
before
you
commit
yourself
to
such
a
i
always
come
to
a
decision
said
bounderby
tossing
his
hat
on
and
whatever
i
do
i
do
at
once
i
should
be
surprised
at
tom
gradgrind
s
addressing
such
a
remark
to
josiah
bounderby
of
coketown
knowing
what
he
knows
of
him
if
i
could
be
surprised
by
anything
tom
gradgrind
did
after
his
making
himself
a
party
to
sentimental
humbug
i
have
given
you
my
decision
and
i
have
got
no
more
to
say
good
night
so
bounderby
went
home
to
his
town
house
to
bed
at
five
minutes
past
twelve
o
clock
next
day
he
directed
bounderby
s
property
to
be
carefully
packed
up
and
sent
to
tom
gradgrind
s
advertised
his
country
retreat
for
sale
by
private
contract
and
resumed
a
bachelor
life
chapter
iv
lost
the
robbery
at
the
bank
had
not
languished
before
and
did
not
cease
to
occupy
a
front
place
in
the
attention
of
the
principal
of
that
establishment
now
in
boastful
proof
of
his
promptitude
and
activity
as
a
remarkable
man
and
a
man
and
a
commercial
wonder
more
admirable
than
venus
who
had
risen
out
of
the
mud
instead
of
the
sea
he
liked
to
show
how
little
his
domestic
affairs
abated
his
business
ardour
consequently
in
the
first
few
weeks
of
his
resumed
bachelorhood
he
even
advanced
upon
his
usual
display
of
bustle
and
every
day
made
such
a
rout
in
renewing
his
investigations
into
the
robbery
that
the
officers
who
had
it
in
hand
almost
wished
it
had
never
been
committed
they
were
at
fault
too
and
off
the
scent
although
they
had
been
so
quiet
since
the
first
outbreak
of
the
matter
that
most
people
really
did
suppose
it
to
have
been
abandoned
as
hopeless
nothing
new
occurred
no
implicated
man
or
woman
took
untimely
courage
or
made
a
step
more
remarkable
yet
stephen
blackpool
could
not
be
heard
of
and
the
mysterious
old
woman
remained
a
mystery
things
having
come
to
this
pass
and
showing
no
latent
signs
of
stirring
beyond
it
the
upshot
of
bounderby
s
investigations
was
that
he
resolved
to
hazard
a
bold
burst
he
drew
up
a
placard
offering
twenty
pounds
reward
for
the
apprehension
of
stephen
blackpool
suspected
of
complicity
in
the
robbery
of
coketown
bank
on
such
a
night
he
described
the
said
stephen
blackpool
by
dress
complexion
estimated
height
and
manner
as
minutely
as
he
could
he
recited
how
he
had
left
the
town
and
in
what
direction
he
had
been
last
seen
going
he
had
the
whole
printed
in
great
black
letters
on
a
staring
broadsheet
and
he
caused
the
walls
to
be
posted
with
it
in
the
dead
of
night
so
that
it
should
strike
upon
the
sight
of
the
whole
population
at
one
blow
the
had
need
to
ring
their
loudest
that
morning
to
disperse
the
groups
of
workers
who
stood
in
the
tardy
daybreak
collected
round
the
placards
devouring
them
with
eager
eyes
not
the
least
eager
of
the
eyes
assembled
were
the
eyes
of
those
who
could
not
read
these
people
as
they
listened
to
the
friendly
voice
that
read
was
always
some
such
ready
to
help
at
the
characters
which
meant
so
much
with
a
vague
awe
and
respect
that
would
have
been
half
ludicrous
if
any
aspect
of
public
ignorance
could
ever
be
otherwise
than
threatening
and
full
of
evil
many
ears
and
eyes
were
busy
with
a
vision
of
the
matter
of
these
placards
among
turning
spindles
rattling
looms
and
whirling
wheels
for
hours
afterwards
and
when
the
hands
cleared
out
again
into
the
streets
there
were
still
as
many
readers
as
before
slackbridge
the
delegate
had
to
address
his
audience
too
that
night
and
slackbridge
had
obtained
a
clean
bill
from
the
printer
and
had
brought
it
in
his
pocket
oh
my
friends
and
the
operatives
of
coketown
oh
my
and
and
and
what
a
was
there
when
slackbridge
unfolded
what
he
called
that
damning
document
and
held
it
up
to
the
gaze
and
for
the
execration
of
the
community
oh
my
behold
of
what
a
traitor
in
the
camp
of
those
great
spirits
who
are
enrolled
upon
the
holy
scroll
of
justice
and
of
union
is
appropriately
capable
oh
my
prostrate
friends
with
the
galling
yoke
of
tyrants
on
your
necks
and
the
iron
foot
of
despotism
treading
down
your
fallen
forms
into
the
dust
of
the
earth
upon
which
right
glad
would
your
oppressors
be
to
see
you
creeping
on
your
bellies
all
the
days
of
your
lives
like
the
serpent
in
the
my
brothers
and
shall
i
as
a
man
not
add
my
sisters
too
what
do
you
say
of
stephen
blackpool
with
a
slight
stoop
in
his
shoulders
and
about
five
foot
seven
in
height
as
set
forth
in
this
degrading
and
disgusting
document
this
blighting
bill
this
pernicious
placard
this
abominable
advertisement
and
with
what
majesty
of
denouncement
will
you
crush
the
viper
who
would
bring
this
stain
and
shame
upon
the
race
that
happily
has
cast
him
out
for
ever
yes
my
compatriots
happily
cast
him
out
and
sent
him
forth
for
you
remember
how
he
stood
here
before
you
on
this
platform
you
remember
how
face
to
face
and
foot
to
foot
i
pursued
him
through
all
his
intricate
windings
you
remember
how
he
sneaked
and
slunk
and
sidled
and
splitted
of
straws
until
with
not
an
inch
of
ground
to
which
to
cling
i
hurled
him
out
from
amongst
us
an
object
for
the
undying
finger
of
scorn
to
point
at
and
for
the
avenging
fire
of
every
free
and
thinking
mind
to
scorch
and
scar
and
now
my
labouring
friends
for
i
rejoice
and
triumph
in
that
friends
whose
hard
but
honest
beds
are
made
in
toil
and
whose
scanty
but
independent
pots
are
boiled
in
hardship
and
now
i
say
my
friends
what
appellation
has
that
dastard
craven
taken
to
himself
when
with
the
mask
torn
from
his
features
he
stands
before
us
in
all
his
native
deformity
a
what
a
thief
a
plunderer
a
proscribed
fugitive
with
a
price
upon
his
head
a
fester
and
a
wound
upon
the
noble
character
of
the
coketown
operative
therefore
my
band
of
brothers
in
a
sacred
bond
to
which
your
children
and
your
children
s
children
yet
unborn
have
set
their
infant
hands
and
seals
i
propose
to
you
on
the
part
of
the
united
aggregate
tribunal
ever
watchful
for
your
welfare
ever
zealous
for
your
benefit
that
this
meeting
does
resolve
that
stephen
blackpool
weaver
referred
to
in
this
placard
having
been
already
solemnly
disowned
by
the
community
of
coketown
hands
the
same
are
free
from
the
shame
of
his
misdeeds
and
can
not
as
a
class
be
reproached
with
his
dishonest
actions
thus
slackbridge
gnashing
and
perspiring
after
a
prodigious
sort
a
few
stern
voices
called
out
no
and
a
score
or
two
hailed
with
assenting
cries
of
hear
hear
the
caution
from
one
man
slackbridge
y
or
over
hetter
in
t
y
or
a
goen
too
fast
but
these
were
pigmies
against
an
army
the
general
assemblage
subscribed
to
the
gospel
according
to
slackbridge
and
gave
three
cheers
for
him
as
he
sat
demonstratively
panting
at
them
these
men
and
women
were
yet
in
the
streets
passing
quietly
to
their
homes
when
sissy
who
had
been
called
away
from
louisa
some
minutes
before
returned
who
is
it
asked
louisa
it
is
bounderby
said
sissy
timid
of
the
name
and
your
brother
tom
and
a
young
woman
who
says
her
name
is
rachael
and
that
you
know
what
do
they
want
sissy
dear
they
want
to
see
you
rachael
has
been
crying
and
seems
father
said
louisa
for
he
was
present
i
can
not
refuse
to
see
them
for
a
reason
that
will
explain
itself
shall
they
come
in
here
as
he
answered
in
the
affirmative
sissy
went
away
to
bring
them
she
reappeared
with
them
directly
tom
was
last
and
remained
standing
in
the
obscurest
part
of
the
room
near
the
door
mrs
bounderby
said
her
husband
entering
with
a
cool
nod
i
don
t
disturb
you
i
hope
this
is
an
unseasonable
hour
but
here
is
a
young
woman
who
has
been
making
statements
which
render
my
visit
necessary
tom
gradgrind
as
your
son
young
tom
refuses
for
some
obstinate
reason
or
other
to
say
anything
at
all
about
those
statements
good
or
bad
i
am
obliged
to
confront
her
with
your
you
have
seen
me
once
before
young
lady
said
rachael
standing
in
front
of
louisa
tom
coughed
you
have
seen
me
young
lady
repeated
rachael
as
she
did
not
answer
once
tom
coughed
again
i
rachael
cast
her
eyes
proudly
towards
bounderby
and
said
will
you
make
it
known
young
lady
where
and
who
was
there
i
went
to
the
house
where
stephen
blackpool
lodged
on
the
night
of
his
discharge
from
his
work
and
i
saw
you
there
he
was
there
too
and
an
old
woman
who
did
not
speak
and
whom
i
could
scarcely
see
stood
in
a
dark
corner
my
brother
was
with
why
couldn
t
you
say
so
young
tom
demanded
bounderby
i
promised
my
sister
i
wouldn
which
louisa
hastily
confirmed
and
besides
said
the
whelp
bitterly
she
tells
her
own
story
so
precious
so
what
business
had
i
to
take
it
out
of
her
mouth
say
young
lady
if
you
please
pursued
rachael
why
in
an
evil
hour
you
ever
came
to
stephen
s
that
i
felt
compassion
for
him
said
louisa
her
colour
deepening
and
i
wished
to
know
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
wished
to
offer
him
thank
you
ma
am
said
bounderby
much
flattered
and
did
you
offer
him
asked
rachael
a
yes
but
he
refused
it
and
would
only
take
two
pounds
in
rachael
cast
her
eyes
towards
bounderby
again
oh
certainly
said
bounderby
if
you
put
the
question
whether
your
ridiculous
and
improbable
account
was
true
or
not
i
am
bound
to
say
it
s
young
lady
said
rachael
stephen
blackpool
is
now
named
as
a
thief
in
public
print
all
over
this
town
and
where
else
there
have
been
a
meeting
where
he
have
been
spoken
of
in
the
same
shameful
way
stephen
the
honestest
lad
the
truest
lad
the
best
her
indignation
failed
her
and
she
broke
off
sobbing
i
am
very
very
sorry
said
louisa
oh
young
lady
young
lady
returned
rachael
i
hope
you
may
be
but
i
don
t
know
i
can
t
say
what
you
may
ha
done
the
like
of
you
don
t
know
us
don
t
care
for
us
don
t
belong
to
us
i
am
not
sure
why
you
may
ha
come
that
night
i
can
t
tell
but
what
you
may
ha
come
wi
some
aim
of
your
own
not
mindin
to
what
trouble
you
brought
such
as
the
poor
lad
i
said
then
bless
you
for
coming
and
i
said
it
of
my
heart
you
seemed
to
take
so
pitifully
to
him
but
i
don
t
know
now
i
don
t
know
louisa
could
not
reproach
her
for
her
unjust
suspicions
she
was
so
faithful
to
her
idea
of
the
man
and
so
afflicted
and
when
i
think
said
rachael
through
her
sobs
that
the
poor
lad
was
so
grateful
thinkin
you
so
good
to
i
mind
that
he
put
his
hand
over
his
face
to
hide
the
tears
that
you
brought
up
i
hope
you
may
be
sorry
and
ha
no
bad
cause
to
be
it
but
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
know
you
re
a
pretty
article
growled
the
whelp
moving
uneasily
in
his
dark
corner
to
come
here
with
these
precious
imputations
you
ought
to
be
bundled
out
for
not
knowing
how
to
behave
yourself
and
you
would
be
by
she
said
nothing
in
reply
and
her
low
weeping
was
the
only
sound
that
was
heard
until
bounderby
spoke
come
said
he
you
know
what
you
have
engaged
to
do
you
had
better
give
your
mind
to
that
not
deed
i
am
loath
returned
rachael
drying
her
eyes
that
any
here
should
see
me
like
this
but
i
won
t
be
seen
so
again
young
lady
when
i
had
read
what
s
put
in
print
of
what
has
just
as
much
truth
in
it
as
if
it
had
been
put
in
print
of
went
straight
to
the
bank
to
say
i
knew
where
stephen
was
and
to
give
a
sure
and
certain
promise
that
he
should
be
here
in
two
days
i
couldn
t
meet
wi
bounderby
then
and
your
brother
sent
me
away
and
i
tried
to
find
you
but
you
was
not
to
be
found
and
i
went
back
to
work
soon
as
i
come
out
of
the
mill
i
hastened
to
hear
what
was
said
of
i
know
wi
pride
he
will
come
back
to
shame
it
then
i
went
again
to
seek
bounderby
and
i
found
him
and
i
told
him
every
word
i
knew
and
he
believed
no
word
i
said
and
brought
me
so
far
that
s
true
enough
assented
bounderby
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
hat
on
but
i
have
known
you
people
before
you
ll
observe
and
i
know
you
never
die
for
want
of
talking
now
i
recommend
you
not
so
much
to
mind
talking
just
now
as
doing
you
have
undertaken
to
do
something
all
i
remark
upon
that
at
present
is
do
it
i
have
written
to
stephen
by
the
post
that
went
out
this
afternoon
as
i
have
written
to
him
once
before
sin
he
went
away
said
rachael
and
he
will
be
here
at
furthest
in
two
then
i
ll
tell
you
something
you
are
not
aware
perhaps
retorted
bounderby
that
you
yourself
have
been
looked
after
now
and
then
not
being
considered
quite
free
from
suspicion
in
this
business
on
account
of
most
people
being
judged
according
to
the
company
they
keep
the
hasn
t
been
forgotten
either
what
i
ll
tell
you
is
that
no
letter
to
stephen
blackpool
has
ever
got
into
it
therefore
what
has
become
of
yours
i
leave
you
to
guess
perhaps
you
re
mistaken
and
never
wrote
he
hadn
t
been
gone
from
here
young
lady
said
rachael
turning
appealingly
to
louisa
as
much
as
a
week
when
he
sent
me
the
only
letter
i
have
had
from
him
saying
that
he
was
forced
to
seek
work
in
another
oh
by
george
cried
bounderby
shaking
his
head
with
a
whistle
he
changes
his
name
does
he
that
s
rather
unlucky
too
for
such
an
immaculate
chap
it
s
considered
a
little
suspicious
in
courts
of
justice
i
believe
when
an
innocent
happens
to
have
many
what
said
rachael
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
again
what
young
lady
in
the
name
of
mercy
was
left
the
poor
lad
to
do
the
masters
against
him
on
one
hand
the
men
against
him
on
the
other
he
only
wantin
to
work
hard
in
peace
and
do
what
he
felt
right
can
a
man
have
no
soul
of
his
own
no
mind
of
his
own
must
he
go
wrong
all
through
wi
this
side
or
must
he
go
wrong
all
through
wi
that
or
else
be
hunted
like
a
hare
indeed
indeed
i
pity
him
from
my
heart
returned
louisa
and
i
hope
that
he
will
clear
you
need
have
no
fear
of
that
young
lady
he
is
sure
all
the
surer
i
suppose
said
bounderby
for
your
refusing
to
tell
where
he
is
eh
he
shall
not
through
any
act
of
mine
come
back
wi
the
unmerited
reproach
of
being
brought
back
he
shall
come
back
of
his
own
accord
to
clear
himself
and
put
all
those
that
have
injured
his
good
character
and
he
not
here
for
its
defence
to
shame
i
have
told
him
what
has
been
done
against
him
said
rachael
throwing
off
all
distrust
as
a
rock
throws
of
the
sea
and
he
will
be
here
at
furthest
in
two
notwithstanding
which
added
bounderby
if
he
can
be
laid
hold
of
any
sooner
he
shall
have
an
earlier
opportunity
of
clearing
himself
as
to
you
i
have
nothing
against
you
what
you
came
and
told
me
turns
out
to
be
true
and
i
have
given
you
the
means
of
proving
it
to
be
true
and
there
s
an
end
of
it
i
wish
you
good
night
all
i
must
be
off
to
look
a
little
further
into
tom
came
out
of
his
corner
when
bounderby
moved
moved
with
him
kept
close
to
him
and
went
away
with
him
the
only
parting
salutation
of
which
he
delivered
himself
was
a
sulky
good
night
father
with
a
brief
speech
and
a
scowl
at
his
sister
he
left
the
house
since
his
had
come
home
gradgrind
had
been
sparing
of
speech
he
still
sat
silent
when
louisa
mildly
said
rachael
you
will
not
distrust
me
one
day
when
you
know
me
it
goes
against
me
rachael
answered
in
a
gentler
manner
to
mistrust
any
one
but
when
i
am
so
we
all
can
not
keep
such
things
quite
out
of
my
mind
i
ask
your
pardon
for
having
done
you
an
injury
i
don
t
think
what
i
said
now
yet
i
might
come
to
think
it
again
wi
the
poor
lad
so
did
you
tell
him
in
your
letter
inquired
sissy
that
suspicion
seemed
to
have
fallen
upon
him
because
he
had
been
seen
about
the
bank
at
night
he
would
then
know
what
he
would
have
to
explain
on
coming
back
and
would
be
yes
dear
she
returned
but
i
can
t
guess
what
can
have
ever
taken
him
there
he
never
used
to
go
there
it
was
never
in
his
way
his
way
was
the
same
as
mine
and
not
near
sissy
had
already
been
at
her
side
asking
her
where
she
lived
and
whether
she
might
come
night
to
inquire
if
there
were
news
of
him
i
doubt
said
rachael
if
he
can
be
here
till
next
then
i
will
come
next
night
too
said
sissy
when
rachael
assenting
to
this
was
gone
gradgrind
lifted
up
his
head
and
said
to
his
daughter
louisa
my
dear
i
have
never
that
i
know
of
seen
this
man
do
you
believe
him
to
be
implicated
i
think
i
have
believed
it
father
though
with
great
difficulty
i
do
not
believe
it
that
is
to
say
you
once
persuaded
yourself
to
believe
it
from
knowing
him
to
be
suspected
his
appearance
and
manner
are
they
so
honest
very
and
her
confidence
not
to
be
shaken
i
ask
myself
said
gradgrind
musing
does
the
real
culprit
know
of
these
accusations
where
is
he
who
is
he
his
hair
had
latterly
began
to
change
its
colour
as
he
leaned
upon
his
hand
again
looking
gray
and
old
louisa
with
a
face
of
fear
and
pity
hurriedly
went
over
to
him
and
sat
close
at
his
side
her
eyes
by
accident
met
sissy
s
at
the
moment
sissy
flushed
and
started
and
louisa
put
her
finger
on
her
lip
next
night
when
sissy
returned
home
and
told
louisa
that
stephen
was
not
come
she
told
it
in
a
whisper
next
night
again
when
she
came
home
with
the
same
account
and
added
that
he
had
not
been
heard
of
she
spoke
in
the
same
low
frightened
tone
from
the
moment
of
that
interchange
of
looks
they
never
uttered
his
name
or
any
reference
to
him
aloud
nor
ever
pursued
the
subject
of
the
robbery
when
gradgrind
spoke
of
it
the
two
appointed
days
ran
out
three
days
and
nights
ran
out
and
stephen
blackpool
was
not
come
and
remained
unheard
of
on
the
fourth
day
rachael
with
unabated
confidence
but
considering
her
despatch
to
have
miscarried
went
up
to
the
bank
and
showed
her
letter
from
him
with
his
address
at
a
working
colony
one
of
many
not
upon
the
main
road
sixty
miles
away
messengers
were
sent
to
that
place
and
the
whole
town
looked
for
stephen
to
be
brought
in
next
day
during
this
whole
time
the
whelp
moved
about
with
bounderby
like
his
shadow
assisting
in
all
the
proceedings
he
was
greatly
excited
horribly
fevered
bit
his
nails
down
to
the
quick
spoke
in
a
hard
rattling
voice
and
with
lips
that
were
black
and
burnt
up
at
the
hour
when
the
suspected
man
was
looked
for
the
whelp
was
at
the
station
offering
to
wager
that
he
had
made
off
before
the
arrival
of
those
who
were
sent
in
quest
of
him
and
that
he
would
not
appear
the
whelp
was
right
the
messengers
returned
alone
rachael
s
letter
had
gone
rachael
s
letter
had
been
delivered
stephen
blackpool
had
decamped
in
that
same
hour
and
no
soul
knew
more
of
him
the
only
doubt
in
coketown
was
whether
rachael
had
written
in
good
faith
believing
that
he
really
would
come
back
or
warning
him
to
fly
on
this
point
opinion
was
divided
six
days
seven
days
far
on
into
another
week
the
wretched
whelp
plucked
up
a
ghastly
courage
and
began
to
grow
defiant
the
suspected
fellow
the
thief
a
pretty
question
if
not
where
was
the
man
and
why
did
he
not
come
back
where
was
the
man
and
why
did
he
not
come
back
in
the
dead
of
night
the
echoes
of
his
own
words
which
had
rolled
heaven
knows
how
far
away
in
the
daytime
came
back
instead
and
abided
by
him
until
morning
chapter
v
found
day
and
night
again
day
and
night
again
no
stephen
blackpool
where
was
the
man
and
why
did
he
not
come
back
every
night
sissy
went
to
rachael
s
lodging
and
sat
with
her
in
her
small
neat
room
all
day
rachael
toiled
as
such
people
must
toil
whatever
their
anxieties
the
were
indifferent
who
was
lost
or
found
who
turned
out
bad
or
good
the
melancholy
mad
elephants
like
the
hard
fact
men
abated
nothing
of
their
set
routine
whatever
happened
day
and
night
again
day
and
night
again
the
monotony
was
unbroken
even
stephen
blackpool
s
disappearance
was
falling
into
the
general
way
and
becoming
as
monotonous
a
wonder
as
any
piece
of
machinery
in
coketown
i
misdoubt
said
rachael
if
there
is
as
many
as
twenty
left
in
all
this
place
who
have
any
trust
in
the
poor
dear
lad
she
said
it
to
sissy
as
they
sat
in
her
lodging
lighted
only
by
the
lamp
at
the
street
corner
sissy
had
come
there
when
it
was
already
dark
to
await
her
return
from
work
and
they
had
since
sat
at
the
window
where
rachael
had
found
her
wanting
no
brighter
light
to
shine
on
their
sorrowful
talk
if
it
hadn
t
been
mercifully
brought
about
that
i
was
to
have
you
to
speak
to
pursued
rachael
times
are
when
i
think
my
mind
would
not
have
kept
right
but
i
get
hope
and
strength
through
you
and
you
believe
that
though
appearances
may
rise
against
him
he
will
be
proved
clear
i
do
believe
so
returned
sissy
with
my
whole
heart
i
feel
so
certain
rachael
that
the
confidence
you
hold
in
yours
against
all
discouragement
is
not
like
to
be
wrong
that
i
have
no
more
doubt
of
him
than
if
i
had
known
him
through
as
many
years
of
trial
as
you
and
i
my
dear
said
rachel
with
a
tremble
in
her
voice
have
known
him
through
them
all
to
be
according
to
his
quiet
ways
so
faithful
to
everything
honest
and
good
that
if
he
was
never
to
be
heard
of
more
and
i
was
to
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
i
could
say
with
my
last
breath
god
knows
my
heart
i
have
never
once
left
trusting
stephen
blackpool
we
all
believe
up
at
the
lodge
rachael
that
he
will
be
freed
from
suspicion
sooner
or
the
better
i
know
it
to
be
so
believed
there
my
dear
said
rachael
and
the
kinder
i
feel
it
that
you
come
away
from
there
purposely
to
comfort
me
and
keep
me
company
and
be
seen
wi
me
when
i
am
not
yet
free
from
all
suspicion
myself
the
more
grieved
i
am
that
i
should
ever
have
spoken
those
mistrusting
words
to
the
young
lady
and
yet
you
don
t
mistrust
her
now
rachael
now
that
you
have
brought
us
more
together
no
but
i
can
t
at
all
times
keep
out
of
my
her
voice
so
sunk
into
a
low
and
slow
communing
with
herself
that
sissy
sitting
by
her
side
was
obliged
to
listen
with
attention
i
can
t
at
all
times
keep
out
of
my
mind
mistrustings
of
some
one
i
can
t
think
who
tis
i
can
t
think
how
or
why
it
may
be
done
but
i
mistrust
that
some
one
has
put
stephen
out
of
the
way
i
mistrust
that
by
his
coming
back
of
his
own
accord
and
showing
himself
innocent
before
them
all
some
one
would
be
confounded
prevent
stopped
him
and
put
him
out
of
the
that
is
a
dreadful
thought
said
sissy
turning
pale
it
a
dreadful
thought
to
think
he
may
be
sissy
shuddered
and
turned
paler
yet
when
it
makes
its
way
into
my
mind
dear
said
rachael
and
it
will
come
sometimes
though
i
do
all
i
can
to
keep
it
out
wi
counting
on
to
high
numbers
as
i
work
and
saying
over
and
over
again
pieces
that
i
knew
when
i
were
a
fall
into
such
a
wild
hot
hurry
that
however
tired
i
am
i
want
to
walk
fast
miles
and
miles
i
must
get
the
better
of
this
before
i
ll
walk
home
wi
he
might
fall
ill
upon
the
journey
back
said
sissy
faintly
offering
a
scrap
of
hope
and
in
such
a
case
there
are
many
places
on
the
road
where
he
might
but
he
is
in
none
of
them
he
has
been
sought
for
in
all
and
he
s
not
true
was
sissy
s
reluctant
admission
he
d
walk
the
journey
in
two
days
if
he
was
footsore
and
couldn
t
walk
i
sent
him
in
the
letter
he
got
the
money
to
ride
lest
he
should
have
none
of
his
own
to
let
us
hope
that
will
bring
something
better
rachael
come
into
the
air
her
gentle
hand
adjusted
rachael
s
shawl
upon
her
shining
black
hair
in
the
usual
manner
of
her
wearing
it
and
they
went
out
the
night
being
fine
little
knots
of
hands
were
here
and
there
lingering
at
street
corners
but
it
was
with
the
greater
part
of
them
and
there
were
but
few
people
in
the
streets
you
re
not
so
hurried
now
rachael
and
your
hand
is
i
get
better
dear
if
i
can
only
walk
and
breathe
a
little
fresh
times
when
i
can
t
i
turn
weak
and
but
you
must
not
begin
to
fail
rachael
for
you
may
be
wanted
at
any
time
to
stand
by
stephen
is
saturday
if
no
news
comes
let
us
walk
in
the
country
on
sunday
morning
and
strengthen
you
for
another
week
will
you
go
yes
they
were
by
this
time
in
the
street
where
bounderby
s
house
stood
the
way
to
sissy
s
destination
led
them
past
the
door
and
they
were
going
straight
towards
it
some
train
had
newly
arrived
in
coketown
which
had
put
a
number
of
vehicles
in
motion
and
scattered
a
considerable
bustle
about
the
town
several
coaches
were
rattling
before
them
and
behind
them
as
they
approached
bounderby
s
and
one
of
the
latter
drew
up
with
such
briskness
as
they
were
in
the
act
of
passing
the
house
that
they
looked
round
involuntarily
the
bright
gaslight
over
bounderby
s
steps
showed
them
sparsit
in
the
coach
in
an
ecstasy
of
excitement
struggling
to
open
the
door
sparsit
seeing
them
at
the
same
moment
called
to
them
to
stop
it
s
a
coincidence
exclaimed
sparsit
as
she
was
released
by
the
coachman
it
s
a
providence
come
out
ma
am
then
said
sparsit
to
some
one
inside
come
out
or
we
ll
have
you
dragged
out
hereupon
no
other
than
the
mysterious
old
woman
descended
whom
sparsit
incontinently
collared
leave
her
alone
everybody
cried
sparsit
with
great
energy
let
nobody
touch
her
she
belongs
to
me
come
in
ma
am
then
said
sparsit
reversing
her
former
word
of
command
come
in
ma
am
or
we
ll
have
you
dragged
in
the
spectacle
of
a
matron
of
classical
deportment
seizing
an
ancient
woman
by
the
throat
and
hauling
her
into
a
would
have
been
under
any
circumstances
sufficient
temptation
to
all
true
english
stragglers
so
blest
as
to
witness
it
to
force
a
way
into
that
and
see
the
matter
out
but
when
the
phenomenon
was
enhanced
by
the
notoriety
and
mystery
by
this
time
associated
all
over
the
town
with
the
bank
robbery
it
would
have
lured
the
stragglers
in
with
an
irresistible
attraction
though
the
roof
had
been
expected
to
fall
upon
their
heads
accordingly
the
chance
witnesses
on
the
ground
consisting
of
the
busiest
of
the
neighbours
to
the
number
of
some
closed
in
after
sissy
and
rachael
as
they
closed
in
after
sparsit
and
her
prize
and
the
whole
body
made
a
disorderly
irruption
into
bounderby
s
where
the
people
behind
lost
not
a
moment
s
time
in
mounting
on
the
chairs
to
get
the
better
of
the
people
in
front
fetch
bounderby
down
cried
sparsit
rachael
young
woman
you
know
who
this
is
it
s
pegler
said
rachael
i
should
think
it
is
cried
sparsit
exulting
fetch
bounderby
stand
away
everybody
here
old
pegler
muffling
herself
up
and
shrinking
from
observation
whispered
a
word
of
entreaty
don
t
tell
me
said
sparsit
aloud
i
have
told
you
twenty
times
coming
along
that
i
will
leave
you
till
i
have
handed
you
over
to
him
bounderby
now
appeared
accompanied
by
gradgrind
and
the
whelp
with
whom
he
had
been
holding
conference
bounderby
looked
more
astonished
than
hospitable
at
sight
of
this
uninvited
party
in
his
why
what
s
the
matter
now
said
he
mrs
sparsit
ma
am
sir
explained
that
worthy
woman
i
trust
it
is
my
good
fortune
to
produce
a
person
you
have
much
desired
to
find
stimulated
by
my
wish
to
relieve
your
mind
sir
and
connecting
together
such
imperfect
clues
to
the
part
of
the
country
in
which
that
person
might
be
supposed
to
reside
as
have
been
afforded
by
the
young
woman
rachael
fortunately
now
present
to
identify
i
have
had
the
happiness
to
succeed
and
to
bring
that
person
with
need
not
say
most
unwillingly
on
her
part
it
has
not
been
sir
without
some
trouble
that
i
have
effected
this
but
trouble
in
your
service
is
to
me
a
pleasure
and
hunger
thirst
and
cold
a
real
here
sparsit
ceased
for
bounderby
s
visage
exhibited
an
extraordinary
combination
of
all
possible
colours
and
expressions
of
discomfiture
as
old
pegler
was
disclosed
to
his
view
why
what
do
you
mean
by
this
was
his
highly
unexpected
demand
in
great
warmth
i
ask
you
what
do
you
mean
by
this
sparsit
ma
am
sir
exclaimed
sparsit
faintly
why
don
t
you
mind
your
own
business
ma
am
roared
bounderby
how
dare
you
go
and
poke
your
officious
nose
into
my
family
affairs
this
allusion
to
her
favourite
feature
overpowered
sparsit
she
sat
down
stiffly
in
a
chair
as
if
she
were
frozen
and
with
a
fixed
stare
at
bounderby
slowly
grated
her
mittens
against
one
another
as
if
they
were
frozen
too
my
dear
josiah
cried
pegler
trembling
my
darling
boy
i
am
not
to
blame
it
s
not
my
fault
josiah
i
told
this
lady
over
and
over
again
that
i
knew
she
was
doing
what
would
not
be
agreeable
to
you
but
she
would
do
what
did
you
let
her
bring
you
for
couldn
t
you
knock
her
cap
off
or
her
tooth
out
or
scratch
her
or
do
something
or
other
to
her
asked
bounderby
my
own
boy
she
threatened
me
that
if
i
resisted
her
i
should
be
brought
by
constables
and
it
was
better
to
come
quietly
than
make
that
stir
in
such
a
pegler
glanced
timidly
but
proudly
round
the
such
a
fine
house
as
this
indeed
indeed
it
is
not
my
fault
my
dear
noble
stately
boy
i
have
always
lived
quiet
and
secret
josiah
my
dear
i
have
never
broken
the
condition
once
i
have
never
said
i
was
your
mother
i
have
admired
you
at
a
distance
and
if
i
have
come
to
town
sometimes
with
long
times
between
to
take
a
proud
peep
at
you
i
have
done
it
unbeknown
my
love
and
gone
away
bounderby
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
walked
in
impatient
mortification
up
and
down
at
the
side
of
the
long
while
the
spectators
greedily
took
in
every
syllable
of
pegler
s
appeal
and
at
each
succeeding
syllable
became
more
and
more
bounderby
still
walking
up
and
down
when
pegler
had
done
gradgrind
addressed
that
maligned
old
lady
i
am
surprised
madam
he
observed
with
severity
that
in
your
old
age
you
have
the
face
to
claim
bounderby
for
your
son
after
your
unnatural
and
inhuman
treatment
of
unnatural
cried
poor
old
pegler
inhuman
to
my
dear
boy
dear
repeated
gradgrind
yes
dear
in
his
prosperity
madam
i
dare
say
not
very
dear
however
when
you
deserted
him
in
his
infancy
and
left
him
to
the
brutality
of
a
drunken
deserted
my
josiah
cried
pegler
clasping
her
hands
now
lord
forgive
you
sir
for
your
wicked
imaginations
and
for
your
scandal
against
the
memory
of
my
poor
mother
who
died
in
my
arms
before
josiah
was
born
may
you
repent
of
it
sir
and
live
to
know
better
she
was
so
very
earnest
and
injured
that
gradgrind
shocked
by
the
possibility
which
dawned
upon
him
said
in
a
gentler
tone
do
you
deny
then
madam
that
you
left
your
son
be
brought
up
in
the
gutter
josiah
in
the
gutter
exclaimed
pegler
no
such
a
thing
sir
never
for
shame
on
you
my
dear
boy
knows
and
will
give
to
know
that
though
he
come
of
humble
parents
he
come
of
parents
that
loved
him
as
dear
as
the
best
could
and
never
thought
it
hardship
on
themselves
to
pinch
a
bit
that
he
might
write
and
cipher
beautiful
and
i
ve
his
books
at
home
to
show
it
aye
have
i
said
pegler
with
indignant
pride
and
my
dear
boy
knows
and
will
give
to
know
sir
that
after
his
beloved
father
died
when
he
was
eight
years
old
his
mother
too
could
pinch
a
bit
as
it
was
her
duty
and
her
pleasure
and
her
pride
to
do
it
to
help
him
out
in
life
and
put
him
prentice
and
a
steady
lad
he
was
and
a
kind
master
he
had
to
lend
him
a
hand
and
well
he
worked
his
own
way
forward
to
be
rich
and
thriving
and
ll
give
you
to
know
this
my
dear
boy
won
though
his
mother
kept
but
a
little
village
shop
he
never
forgot
her
but
pensioned
me
on
thirty
pound
a
than
i
want
for
i
put
by
out
of
making
the
condition
that
i
was
to
keep
down
in
my
own
part
and
make
no
boasts
about
him
and
not
trouble
him
and
i
never
have
except
with
looking
at
him
once
a
year
when
he
has
never
knowed
it
and
it
s
right
said
poor
old
pegler
in
affectionate
championship
that
i
keep
down
in
my
own
part
and
i
have
no
doubts
that
if
i
was
here
i
should
do
a
many
unbefitting
things
and
i
am
well
contented
and
i
can
keep
my
pride
in
my
josiah
to
myself
and
i
can
love
for
love
s
own
sake
and
i
am
ashamed
of
you
sir
said
pegler
lastly
for
your
slanders
and
suspicions
and
i
never
stood
here
before
nor
never
wanted
to
stand
here
when
my
dear
son
said
no
and
i
shouldn
t
be
here
now
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
being
brought
here
and
for
shame
upon
you
oh
for
shame
to
accuse
me
of
being
a
bad
mother
to
my
son
with
my
son
standing
here
to
tell
you
so
different
the
bystanders
on
and
off
the
chairs
raised
a
murmur
of
sympathy
with
pegler
and
gradgrind
felt
himself
innocently
placed
in
a
very
distressing
predicament
when
bounderby
who
had
never
ceased
walking
up
and
down
and
had
every
moment
swelled
larger
and
larger
and
grown
redder
and
redder
stopped
short
i
don
t
exactly
know
said
bounderby
how
i
come
to
be
favoured
with
the
attendance
of
the
present
company
but
i
don
t
inquire
when
they
re
quite
satisfied
perhaps
they
ll
be
so
good
as
to
disperse
whether
they
re
satisfied
or
not
perhaps
they
ll
be
so
good
as
to
disperse
i
m
not
bound
to
deliver
a
lecture
on
my
family
affairs
i
have
not
undertaken
to
do
it
and
i
m
not
a
going
to
do
it
therefore
those
who
expect
any
explanation
whatever
upon
that
branch
of
the
subject
will
be
tom
gradgrind
and
he
can
t
know
it
too
soon
in
reference
to
the
bank
robbery
there
has
been
a
mistake
made
concerning
my
mother
if
there
hadn
t
been
it
wouldn
t
have
been
made
and
i
hate
at
all
times
whether
or
no
good
evening
although
bounderby
carried
it
off
in
these
terms
holding
the
door
open
for
the
company
to
depart
there
was
a
blustering
sheepishness
upon
him
at
once
extremely
crestfallen
and
superlatively
absurd
detected
as
the
bully
of
humility
who
had
built
his
windy
reputation
upon
lies
and
in
his
boastfulness
had
put
the
honest
truth
as
far
away
from
him
as
if
he
had
advanced
the
mean
claim
there
is
no
meaner
to
tack
himself
on
to
a
pedigree
he
cut
a
most
ridiculous
figure
with
the
people
filing
off
at
the
door
he
held
who
he
knew
would
carry
what
had
passed
to
the
whole
town
to
be
given
to
the
four
winds
he
could
not
have
looked
a
bully
more
shorn
and
forlorn
if
he
had
had
his
ears
cropped
even
that
unlucky
female
sparsit
fallen
from
her
pinnacle
of
exultation
into
the
slough
of
despond
was
not
in
so
bad
a
plight
as
that
remarkable
man
and
humbug
josiah
bounderby
of
coketown
rachael
and
sissy
leaving
pegler
to
occupy
a
bed
at
her
son
s
for
that
night
walked
together
to
the
gate
of
stone
lodge
and
there
parted
gradgrind
joined
them
before
they
had
gone
very
far
and
spoke
with
much
interest
of
stephen
blackpool
for
whom
he
thought
this
signal
failure
of
the
suspicions
against
pegler
was
likely
to
work
well
as
to
the
whelp
throughout
this
scene
as
on
all
other
late
occasions
he
had
stuck
close
to
bounderby
he
seemed
to
feel
that
as
long
as
bounderby
could
make
no
discovery
without
his
knowledge
he
was
so
far
safe
he
never
visited
his
sister
and
had
only
seen
her
once
since
she
went
home
that
is
to
say
on
the
night
when
he
still
stuck
close
to
bounderby
as
already
related
there
was
one
dim
unformed
fear
lingering
about
his
sister
s
mind
to
which
she
never
gave
utterance
which
surrounded
the
graceless
and
ungrateful
boy
with
a
dreadful
mystery
the
same
dark
possibility
had
presented
itself
in
the
same
shapeless
guise
this
very
day
to
sissy
when
rachael
spoke
of
some
one
who
would
be
confounded
by
stephen
s
return
having
put
him
out
of
the
way
louisa
had
never
spoken
of
harbouring
any
suspicion
of
her
brother
in
connexion
with
the
robbery
she
and
sissy
had
held
no
confidence
on
the
subject
save
in
that
one
interchange
of
looks
when
the
unconscious
father
rested
his
gray
head
on
his
hand
but
it
was
understood
between
them
and
they
both
knew
it
this
other
fear
was
so
awful
that
it
hovered
about
each
of
them
like
a
ghostly
shadow
neither
daring
to
think
of
its
being
near
herself
far
less
of
its
being
near
the
other
and
still
the
forced
spirit
which
the
whelp
had
plucked
up
throve
with
him
if
stephen
blackpool
was
not
the
thief
let
him
show
himself
why
didn
t
he
another
night
another
day
and
night
no
stephen
blackpool
where
was
the
man
and
why
did
he
not
come
back
chapter
vi
the
starlight
the
sunday
was
a
bright
sunday
in
autumn
clear
and
cool
when
early
in
the
morning
sissy
and
rachael
met
to
walk
in
the
country
as
coketown
cast
ashes
not
only
on
its
own
head
but
on
the
neighbourhood
s
the
manner
of
those
pious
persons
who
do
penance
for
their
own
sins
by
putting
other
people
into
was
customary
for
those
who
now
and
then
thirsted
for
a
draught
of
pure
air
which
is
not
absolutely
the
most
wicked
among
the
vanities
of
life
to
get
a
few
miles
away
by
the
railroad
and
then
begin
their
walk
or
their
lounge
in
the
fields
sissy
and
rachael
helped
themselves
out
of
the
smoke
by
the
usual
means
and
were
put
down
at
a
station
about
midway
between
the
town
and
bounderby
s
retreat
though
the
green
landscape
was
blotted
here
and
there
with
heaps
of
coal
it
was
green
elsewhere
and
there
were
trees
to
see
and
there
were
larks
singing
though
it
was
sunday
and
there
were
pleasant
scents
in
the
air
and
all
was
by
a
bright
blue
sky
in
the
distance
one
way
coketown
showed
as
a
black
mist
in
another
distance
hills
began
to
rise
in
a
third
there
was
a
faint
change
in
the
light
of
the
horizon
where
it
shone
upon
the
sea
under
their
feet
the
grass
was
fresh
beautiful
shadows
of
branches
flickered
upon
it
and
speckled
it
hedgerows
were
luxuriant
everything
was
at
peace
engines
at
pits
mouths
and
lean
old
horses
that
had
worn
the
circle
of
their
daily
labour
into
the
ground
were
alike
quiet
wheels
had
ceased
for
a
short
space
to
turn
and
the
great
wheel
of
earth
seemed
to
revolve
without
the
shocks
and
noises
of
another
time
they
walked
on
across
the
fields
and
down
the
shady
lanes
sometimes
getting
over
a
fragment
of
a
fence
so
rotten
that
it
dropped
at
a
touch
of
the
foot
sometimes
passing
near
a
wreck
of
bricks
and
beams
overgrown
with
grass
marking
the
site
of
deserted
works
they
followed
paths
and
tracks
however
slight
mounds
where
the
grass
was
rank
and
high
and
where
brambles
and
vegetation
were
confusedly
heaped
together
they
always
avoided
for
dismal
stories
were
told
in
that
country
of
the
old
pits
hidden
beneath
such
indications
the
sun
was
high
when
they
sat
down
to
rest
they
had
seen
no
one
near
or
distant
for
a
long
time
and
the
solitude
remained
unbroken
it
is
so
still
here
rachael
and
the
way
is
so
untrodden
that
i
think
we
must
be
the
first
who
have
been
here
all
the
as
sissy
said
it
her
eyes
were
attracted
by
another
of
those
rotten
fragments
of
fence
upon
the
ground
she
got
up
to
look
at
it
and
yet
i
don
t
know
this
has
not
been
broken
very
long
the
wood
is
quite
fresh
where
it
gave
way
here
are
footsteps
rachael
she
ran
back
and
caught
her
round
the
neck
rachael
had
already
started
up
what
is
the
matter
i
don
t
know
there
is
a
hat
lying
in
the
they
went
forward
together
rachael
took
it
up
shaking
from
head
to
foot
she
broke
into
a
passion
of
tears
and
lamentations
stephen
blackpool
was
written
in
his
own
hand
on
the
inside
o
the
poor
lad
the
poor
lad
he
has
been
made
away
with
he
is
lying
murdered
here
is
the
hat
any
blood
upon
it
sissy
faltered
they
were
afraid
to
look
but
they
did
examine
it
and
found
no
mark
of
violence
inside
or
out
it
had
been
lying
there
some
days
for
rain
and
dew
had
stained
it
and
the
mark
of
its
shape
was
on
the
grass
where
it
had
fallen
they
looked
fearfully
about
them
without
moving
but
could
see
nothing
more
rachael
sissy
whispered
i
will
go
on
a
little
by
she
had
unclasped
her
hand
and
was
in
the
act
of
stepping
forward
when
rachael
caught
her
in
both
arms
with
a
scream
that
resounded
over
the
wide
landscape
before
them
at
their
very
feet
was
the
brink
of
a
black
ragged
chasm
hidden
by
the
thick
grass
they
sprang
back
and
fell
upon
their
knees
each
hiding
her
face
upon
the
other
s
neck
o
my
good
lord
he
s
down
there
down
there
at
first
this
and
her
terrific
screams
were
all
that
could
be
got
from
rachael
by
any
tears
by
any
prayers
by
any
representations
by
any
means
it
was
impossible
to
hush
her
and
it
was
deadly
necessary
to
hold
her
or
she
would
have
flung
herself
down
the
shaft
rachael
dear
rachael
good
rachael
for
the
love
of
heaven
not
these
dreadful
cries
think
of
stephen
think
of
stephen
think
of
stephen
by
an
earnest
repetition
of
this
entreaty
poured
out
in
all
the
agony
of
such
a
moment
sissy
at
last
brought
her
to
be
silent
and
to
look
at
her
with
a
tearless
face
of
stone
rachael
stephen
may
be
living
you
wouldn
t
leave
him
lying
maimed
at
the
bottom
of
this
dreadful
place
a
moment
if
you
could
bring
help
to
him
no
no
no
don
t
stir
from
here
for
his
sake
let
me
go
and
she
shuddered
to
approach
the
pit
but
she
crept
towards
it
on
her
hands
and
knees
and
called
to
him
as
loud
as
she
could
call
she
listened
but
no
sound
replied
she
called
again
and
listened
still
no
answering
sound
she
did
this
twenty
thirty
times
she
took
a
little
clod
of
earth
from
the
broken
ground
where
he
had
stumbled
and
threw
it
in
she
could
not
hear
it
fall
the
wide
prospect
so
beautiful
in
its
stillness
but
a
few
minutes
ago
almost
carried
despair
to
her
brave
heart
as
she
rose
and
looked
all
round
her
seeing
no
help
rachael
we
must
lose
not
a
moment
we
must
go
in
different
directions
seeking
aid
you
shall
go
by
the
way
we
have
come
and
i
will
go
forward
by
the
path
tell
any
one
you
see
and
every
one
what
has
happened
think
of
stephen
think
of
stephen
she
knew
by
rachael
s
face
that
she
might
trust
her
now
and
after
standing
for
a
moment
to
see
her
running
wringing
her
hands
as
she
ran
she
turned
and
went
upon
her
own
search
she
stopped
at
the
hedge
to
tie
her
shawl
there
as
a
guide
to
the
place
then
threw
her
bonnet
aside
and
ran
as
she
had
never
run
before
run
sissy
run
in
heaven
s
name
don
t
stop
for
breath
run
run
quickening
herself
by
carrying
such
entreaties
in
her
thoughts
she
ran
from
field
to
field
and
lane
to
lane
and
place
to
place
as
she
had
never
run
before
until
she
came
to
a
shed
by
an
where
two
men
lay
in
the
shade
asleep
on
straw
first
to
wake
them
and
next
to
tell
them
all
so
wild
and
breathless
as
she
was
what
had
brought
her
there
were
difficulties
but
they
no
sooner
understood
her
than
their
spirits
were
on
fire
like
hers
one
of
the
men
was
in
a
drunken
slumber
but
on
his
comrade
s
shouting
to
him
that
a
man
had
fallen
down
the
old
hell
shaft
he
started
out
to
a
pool
of
dirty
water
put
his
head
in
it
and
came
back
sober
with
these
two
men
she
ran
to
another
further
and
with
that
one
to
another
while
they
ran
elsewhere
then
a
horse
was
found
and
she
got
another
man
to
ride
for
life
or
death
to
the
railroad
and
send
a
message
to
louisa
which
she
wrote
and
gave
him
by
this
time
a
whole
village
was
up
and
windlasses
ropes
poles
candles
lanterns
all
things
necessary
were
fast
collecting
and
being
brought
into
one
place
to
be
carried
to
the
old
hell
shaft
it
seemed
now
hours
and
hours
since
she
had
left
the
lost
man
lying
in
the
grave
where
he
had
been
buried
alive
she
could
not
bear
to
remain
away
from
it
any
was
like
deserting
she
hurried
swiftly
back
accompanied
by
labourers
including
the
drunken
man
whom
the
news
had
sobered
and
who
was
the
best
man
of
all
when
they
came
to
the
old
hell
shaft
they
found
it
as
lonely
as
she
had
left
it
the
men
called
and
listened
as
she
had
done
and
examined
the
edge
of
the
chasm
and
settled
how
it
had
happened
and
then
sat
down
to
wait
until
the
implements
they
wanted
should
come
up
every
sound
of
insects
in
the
air
every
stirring
of
the
leaves
every
whisper
among
these
men
made
sissy
tremble
for
she
thought
it
was
a
cry
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit
but
the
wind
blew
idly
over
it
and
no
sound
arose
to
the
surface
and
they
sat
upon
the
grass
waiting
and
waiting
after
they
had
waited
some
time
straggling
people
who
had
heard
of
the
accident
began
to
come
up
then
the
real
help
of
implements
began
to
arrive
in
the
midst
of
this
rachael
returned
and
with
her
party
there
was
a
surgeon
who
brought
some
wine
and
medicines
but
the
expectation
among
the
people
that
the
man
would
be
found
alive
was
very
slight
indeed
there
being
now
people
enough
present
to
impede
the
work
the
sobered
man
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
rest
or
was
put
there
by
the
general
consent
and
made
a
large
ring
round
the
old
hell
shaft
and
appointed
men
to
keep
it
besides
such
volunteers
as
were
accepted
to
work
only
sissy
and
rachael
were
at
first
permitted
within
this
ring
but
later
in
the
day
when
the
message
brought
an
express
from
coketown
gradgrind
and
louisa
and
bounderby
and
the
whelp
were
also
there
the
sun
was
four
hours
lower
than
when
sissy
and
rachael
had
first
sat
down
upon
the
grass
before
a
means
of
enabling
two
men
to
descend
securely
was
rigged
with
poles
and
ropes
difficulties
had
arisen
in
the
construction
of
this
machine
simple
as
it
was
requisites
had
been
found
wanting
and
messages
had
had
to
go
and
return
it
was
five
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
bright
autumnal
sunday
before
a
candle
was
sent
down
to
try
the
air
while
three
or
four
rough
faces
stood
crowded
close
together
attentively
watching
it
the
man
at
the
windlass
lowering
as
they
were
told
the
candle
was
brought
up
again
feebly
burning
and
then
some
water
was
cast
in
then
the
bucket
was
hooked
on
and
the
sobered
man
and
another
got
in
with
lights
giving
the
word
lower
away
as
the
rope
went
out
tight
and
strained
and
the
windlass
creaked
there
was
not
a
breath
among
the
one
or
two
hundred
men
and
women
looking
on
that
came
as
it
was
wont
to
come
the
signal
was
given
and
the
windlass
stopped
with
abundant
rope
to
spare
apparently
so
long
an
interval
ensued
with
the
men
at
the
windlass
standing
idle
that
some
women
shrieked
that
another
accident
had
happened
but
the
surgeon
who
held
the
watch
declared
five
minutes
not
to
have
elapsed
yet
and
sternly
admonished
them
to
keep
silence
he
had
not
well
done
speaking
when
the
windlass
was
reversed
and
worked
again
practised
eyes
knew
that
it
did
not
go
as
heavily
as
it
would
if
both
workmen
had
been
coming
up
and
that
only
one
was
returning
the
rope
came
in
tight
and
strained
and
ring
after
ring
was
coiled
upon
the
barrel
of
the
windlass
and
all
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
pit
the
sobered
man
was
brought
up
and
leaped
out
briskly
on
the
grass
there
was
an
universal
cry
of
alive
or
dead
and
then
a
deep
profound
hush
when
he
said
alive
a
great
shout
arose
and
many
eyes
had
tears
in
them
but
he
s
hurt
very
bad
he
added
as
soon
as
he
could
make
himself
heard
again
where
s
doctor
he
s
hurt
so
very
bad
sir
that
we
donno
how
to
get
him
they
all
consulted
together
and
looked
anxiously
at
the
surgeon
as
he
asked
some
questions
and
shook
his
head
on
receiving
the
replies
the
sun
was
setting
now
and
the
red
light
in
the
evening
sky
touched
every
face
there
and
caused
it
to
be
distinctly
seen
in
all
its
rapt
suspense
the
consultation
ended
in
the
men
returning
to
the
windlass
and
the
pitman
going
down
again
carrying
the
wine
and
some
other
small
matters
with
him
then
the
other
man
came
up
in
the
meantime
under
the
surgeon
s
directions
some
men
brought
a
hurdle
on
which
others
made
a
thick
bed
of
spare
clothes
covered
with
loose
straw
while
he
himself
contrived
some
bandages
and
slings
from
shawls
and
handkerchiefs
as
these
were
made
they
were
hung
upon
an
arm
of
the
pitman
who
had
last
come
up
with
instructions
how
to
use
them
and
as
he
stood
shown
by
the
light
he
carried
leaning
his
powerful
loose
hand
upon
one
of
the
poles
and
sometimes
glancing
down
the
pit
and
sometimes
glancing
round
upon
the
people
he
was
not
the
least
conspicuous
figure
in
the
scene
it
was
dark
now
and
torches
were
kindled
it
appeared
from
the
little
this
man
said
to
those
about
him
which
was
quickly
repeated
all
over
the
circle
that
the
lost
man
had
fallen
upon
a
mass
of
crumbled
rubbish
with
which
the
pit
was
half
choked
up
and
that
his
fall
had
been
further
broken
by
some
jagged
earth
at
the
side
he
lay
upon
his
back
with
one
arm
doubled
under
him
and
according
to
his
own
belief
had
hardly
stirred
since
he
fell
except
that
he
had
moved
his
free
hand
to
a
side
pocket
in
which
he
remembered
to
have
some
bread
and
meat
of
which
he
had
swallowed
crumbs
and
had
likewise
scooped
up
a
little
water
in
it
now
and
then
he
had
come
straight
away
from
his
work
on
being
written
to
and
had
walked
the
whole
journey
and
was
on
his
way
to
bounderby
s
country
house
after
dark
when
he
fell
he
was
crossing
that
dangerous
country
at
such
a
dangerous
time
because
he
was
innocent
of
what
was
laid
to
his
charge
and
couldn
t
rest
from
coming
the
nearest
way
to
deliver
himself
up
the
old
hell
shaft
the
pitman
said
with
a
curse
upon
it
was
worthy
of
its
bad
name
to
the
last
for
though
stephen
could
speak
now
he
believed
it
would
soon
be
found
to
have
mangled
the
life
out
of
him
when
all
was
ready
this
man
still
taking
his
last
hurried
charges
from
his
comrades
and
the
surgeon
after
the
windlass
had
begun
to
lower
him
disappeared
into
the
pit
the
rope
went
out
as
before
the
signal
was
made
as
before
and
the
windlass
stopped
no
man
removed
his
hand
from
it
now
every
one
waited
with
his
grasp
set
and
his
body
bent
down
to
the
work
ready
to
reverse
and
wind
in
at
length
the
signal
was
given
and
all
the
ring
leaned
forward
for
now
the
rope
came
in
tightened
and
strained
to
its
utmost
as
it
appeared
and
the
men
turned
heavily
and
the
windlass
complained
it
was
scarcely
endurable
to
look
at
the
rope
and
think
of
its
giving
way
but
ring
after
ring
was
coiled
upon
the
barrel
of
the
windlass
safely
and
the
connecting
chains
appeared
and
finally
the
bucket
with
the
two
men
holding
on
at
the
sight
to
make
the
head
swim
and
oppress
the
tenderly
supporting
between
them
slung
and
tied
within
the
figure
of
a
poor
crushed
human
creature
a
low
murmur
of
pity
went
round
the
throng
and
the
women
wept
aloud
as
this
form
almost
without
form
was
moved
very
slowly
from
its
iron
deliverance
and
laid
upon
the
bed
of
straw
at
first
none
but
the
surgeon
went
close
to
it
he
did
what
he
could
in
its
adjustment
on
the
couch
but
the
best
that
he
could
do
was
to
cover
it
that
gently
done
he
called
to
him
rachael
and
sissy
and
at
that
time
the
pale
worn
patient
face
was
seen
looking
up
at
the
sky
with
the
broken
right
hand
lying
bare
on
the
outside
of
the
covering
garments
as
if
waiting
to
be
taken
by
another
hand
they
gave
him
drink
moistened
his
face
with
water
and
administered
some
drops
of
cordial
and
wine
though
he
lay
quite
motionless
looking
up
at
the
sky
he
smiled
and
said
she
stooped
down
on
the
grass
at
his
side
and
bent
over
him
until
her
eyes
were
between
his
and
the
sky
for
he
could
not
so
much
as
turn
them
to
look
at
her
rachael
my
she
took
his
hand
he
smiled
again
and
said
don
t
let
t
thou

great
pain

faintly

without
any
anger
against
any

merely
as

truth

approached

but
he
could
not

lying
with
his
face
turned
up
to
the
night
sky
if

that

the
bearers
being
now
ready
to
carry
him
away
and
the
surgeon
being
anxious
for
his
removal
those
who
had
torches
or
lanterns
prepared
to
go
in
front
of
the
litter
before
it
was
raised
and
while
they
were
arranging
how
to
go
he
said
to
rachael
looking
upward
at
the
star
often
as
i
coom
to
myseln
and
found
it
shinin
on
me
down
there
in
my
trouble
i
thowt
it
were
the
star
as
guided
to
our
saviour
s
home
i
awmust
think
it
be
the
very
star
they
lifted
him
up
and
he
was
overjoyed
to
find
that
they
were
about
to
take
him
in
the
direction
whither
the
star
seemed
to
him
to
lead
rachael

t
let

hand
and
keep
beside
thee
stephen
all
the
bless
thee
will
soombody
be
pleased
to
coover
my
face
they
carried
him
very
gently
along
the
fields
and
down
the
lanes
and
over
the
wide
landscape
rachael
always
holding
the
hand
in
hers
very
few
whispers
broke
the
mournful
silence
it
was
soon
a
funeral
procession
the
star
had
shown
him
where
to
find
the
god
of
the
poor
and
through
humility
and
sorrow
and
forgiveness
he
had
gone
to
his
redeemer
s
rest
chapter
vii
before
the
ring
formed
round
the
old
hell
shaft
was
broken
one
figure
had
disappeared
from
within
it
bounderby
and
his
shadow
had
not
stood
near
louisa
who
held
her
father
s
arm
but
in
a
retired
place
by
themselves
when
gradgrind
was
summoned
to
the
couch
sissy
attentive
to
all
that
happened
slipped
behind
that
wicked
sight
in
the
horror
of
his
face
if
there
had
been
eyes
there
for
any
sight
but
whispered
in
his
ear
without
turning
his
head
he
conferred
with
her
a
few
moments
and
vanished
thus
the
whelp
had
gone
out
of
the
circle
before
the
people
moved
when
the
father
reached
home
he
sent
a
message
to
bounderby
s
desiring
his
son
to
come
to
him
directly
the
reply
was
that
bounderby
having
missed
him
in
the
crowd
and
seeing
nothing
of
him
since
had
supposed
him
to
be
at
stone
lodge
i
believe
father
said
louisa
he
will
not
come
back
to
town
gradgrind
turned
away
and
said
no
more
in
the
morning
he
went
down
to
the
bank
himself
as
soon
as
it
was
opened
and
seeing
his
son
s
place
empty
he
had
not
the
courage
to
look
in
at
first
went
back
along
the
street
to
meet
bounderby
on
his
way
there
to
whom
he
said
that
for
reasons
he
would
soon
explain
but
entreated
not
then
to
be
asked
for
he
had
found
it
necessary
to
employ
his
son
at
a
distance
for
a
little
while
also
that
he
was
charged
with
the
duty
of
vindicating
stephen
blackpool
s
memory
and
declaring
the
thief
bounderby
quite
confounded
stood
in
the
street
after
his
had
left
him
swelling
like
an
immense
without
its
beauty
gradgrind
went
home
locked
himself
in
his
room
and
kept
it
all
that
day
when
sissy
and
louisa
tapped
at
his
door
he
said
without
opening
it
not
now
my
dears
in
the
on
their
return
in
the
evening
he
said
i
am
not
able
he
ate
nothing
all
day
and
had
no
candle
after
dark
and
they
heard
him
walking
to
and
fro
late
at
night
but
in
the
morning
he
appeared
at
breakfast
at
the
usual
hour
and
took
his
usual
place
at
the
table
aged
and
bent
he
looked
and
quite
bowed
down
and
yet
he
looked
a
wiser
man
and
a
better
man
than
in
the
days
when
in
this
life
he
wanted
facts
before
he
left
the
room
he
appointed
a
time
for
them
to
come
to
him
and
so
with
his
gray
head
drooping
went
away
dear
father
said
louisa
when
they
kept
their
appointment
you
have
three
young
children
left
they
will
be
different
i
will
be
different
yet
with
heaven
s
she
gave
her
hand
to
sissy
as
if
she
meant
with
her
help
too
your
wretched
brother
said
gradgrind
do
you
think
he
had
planned
this
robbery
when
he
went
with
you
to
the
lodging
i
fear
so
father
i
know
he
had
wanted
money
very
much
and
had
spent
a
great
the
poor
man
being
about
to
leave
the
town
it
came
into
his
evil
brain
to
cast
suspicion
on
him
i
think
it
must
have
flashed
upon
him
while
he
sat
there
father
for
i
asked
him
to
go
there
with
me
the
visit
did
not
originate
with
he
had
some
conversation
with
the
poor
man
did
he
take
him
aside
he
took
him
out
of
the
room
i
asked
him
afterwards
why
he
had
done
so
and
he
made
a
plausible
excuse
but
since
last
night
father
and
when
i
remember
the
circumstances
by
its
light
i
am
afraid
i
can
imagine
too
truly
what
passed
between
let
me
know
said
her
father
if
your
thoughts
present
your
guilty
brother
in
the
same
dark
view
as
i
fear
father
hesitated
louisa
that
he
must
have
made
some
representation
to
stephen
in
my
name
perhaps
in
his
induced
him
to
do
in
good
faith
and
honesty
what
he
had
never
done
before
and
to
wait
about
the
bank
those
two
or
three
nights
before
he
left
the
too
plain
returned
the
father
too
plain
he
shaded
his
face
and
remained
silent
for
some
moments
recovering
himself
he
said
and
now
how
is
he
to
be
found
how
is
he
to
be
saved
from
justice
in
the
few
hours
that
i
can
possibly
allow
to
elapse
before
i
publish
the
truth
how
is
he
to
be
found
by
us
and
only
by
us
ten
thousand
pounds
could
not
effect
sissy
has
effected
it
he
raised
his
eyes
to
where
she
stood
like
a
good
fairy
in
his
house
and
said
in
a
tone
of
softened
gratitude
and
grateful
kindness
it
is
always
you
my
child
we
had
our
fears
sissy
explained
glancing
at
louisa
before
yesterday
and
when
i
saw
you
brought
to
the
side
of
the
litter
last
night
and
heard
what
passed
being
close
to
rachael
all
the
time
i
went
to
him
when
no
one
saw
and
said
to
him
don
t
look
at
me
see
where
your
father
is
escape
at
once
for
his
sake
and
your
own
he
was
in
a
tremble
before
i
whispered
to
him
and
he
started
and
trembled
more
then
and
said
where
can
i
go
i
have
very
little
money
and
i
don
t
know
who
will
hide
me
i
thought
of
father
s
old
circus
i
have
not
forgotten
where
sleary
goes
at
this
time
of
year
and
i
read
of
him
in
a
paper
only
the
other
day
i
told
him
to
hurry
there
and
tell
his
name
and
ask
sleary
to
hide
him
till
i
came
i
ll
get
to
him
before
the
morning
he
said
and
i
saw
him
shrink
away
among
the
thank
heaven
exclaimed
his
father
he
may
be
got
abroad
it
was
the
more
hopeful
as
the
town
to
which
sissy
had
directed
him
was
within
three
hours
journey
of
liverpool
whence
he
could
be
swiftly
dispatched
to
any
part
of
the
world
but
caution
being
necessary
in
communicating
with
there
was
a
greater
danger
every
moment
of
his
being
suspected
now
and
nobody
could
be
sure
at
heart
but
that
bounderby
himself
in
a
bullying
vein
of
public
zeal
might
play
a
roman
was
consented
that
sissy
and
louisa
should
repair
to
the
place
in
question
by
a
circuitous
course
alone
and
that
the
unhappy
father
setting
forth
in
an
opposite
direction
should
get
round
to
the
same
bourne
by
another
and
wider
route
it
was
further
agreed
that
he
should
not
present
himself
to
sleary
lest
his
intentions
should
be
mistrusted
or
the
intelligence
of
his
arrival
should
cause
his
son
to
take
flight
anew
but
that
the
communication
should
be
left
to
sissy
and
louisa
to
open
and
that
they
should
inform
the
cause
of
so
much
misery
and
disgrace
of
his
father
s
being
at
hand
and
of
the
purpose
for
which
they
had
come
when
these
arrangements
had
been
well
considered
and
were
fully
understood
by
all
three
it
was
time
to
begin
to
carry
them
into
execution
early
in
the
afternoon
gradgrind
walked
direct
from
his
own
house
into
the
country
to
be
taken
up
on
the
line
by
which
he
was
to
travel
and
at
night
the
remaining
two
set
forth
upon
their
different
course
encouraged
by
not
seeing
any
face
they
knew
the
two
travelled
all
night
except
when
they
were
left
for
odd
numbers
of
minutes
at
up
illimitable
flights
of
steps
or
down
was
the
only
variety
of
those
early
in
the
morning
were
turned
out
on
a
swamp
a
mile
or
two
from
the
town
they
sought
from
this
dismal
spot
they
were
rescued
by
a
savage
old
postilion
who
happened
to
be
up
early
kicking
a
horse
in
a
fly
and
so
were
smuggled
into
the
town
by
all
the
back
lanes
where
the
pigs
lived
which
although
not
a
magnificent
or
even
savoury
approach
was
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
the
legitimate
highway
the
first
thing
they
saw
on
entering
the
town
was
the
skeleton
of
sleary
s
circus
the
company
had
departed
for
another
town
more
than
twenty
miles
off
and
had
opened
there
last
night
the
connection
between
the
two
places
was
by
a
hilly
and
the
travelling
on
that
road
was
very
slow
though
they
took
but
a
hasty
breakfast
and
no
rest
which
it
would
have
been
in
vain
to
seek
under
such
anxious
circumstances
it
was
noon
before
they
began
to
find
the
bills
of
sleary
s
on
barns
and
walls
and
one
o
clock
when
they
stopped
in
the
a
grand
morning
performance
by
the
riders
commencing
at
that
very
hour
was
in
course
of
announcement
by
the
bellman
as
they
set
their
feet
upon
the
stones
of
the
street
sissy
recommended
that
to
avoid
making
inquiries
and
attracting
attention
in
the
town
they
should
present
themselves
to
pay
at
the
door
if
sleary
were
taking
the
money
he
would
be
sure
to
know
her
and
would
proceed
with
discretion
if
he
were
not
he
would
be
sure
to
see
them
inside
and
knowing
what
he
had
done
with
the
fugitive
would
proceed
with
discretion
still
therefore
they
repaired
with
fluttering
hearts
to
the
booth
the
flag
with
the
inscription
sleary
s
was
there
and
the
gothic
niche
was
there
but
sleary
was
not
there
master
kidderminster
grown
too
maturely
turfy
to
be
received
by
the
wildest
credulity
as
cupid
any
more
had
yielded
to
the
invincible
force
of
circumstances
and
his
beard
and
in
the
capacity
of
a
man
who
made
himself
generally
useful
presided
on
this
occasion
over
the
also
a
drum
in
reserve
on
which
to
expend
his
leisure
moments
and
superfluous
forces
in
the
extreme
sharpness
of
his
look
out
for
base
coin
kidderminster
as
at
present
situated
never
saw
anything
but
money
so
sissy
passed
him
unrecognised
and
they
went
in
the
emperor
of
japan
on
a
steady
old
white
horse
stencilled
with
black
spots
was
twirling
five
basins
at
once
as
it
is
the
favourite
recreation
of
that
monarch
to
do
sissy
though
well
acquainted
with
his
royal
line
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
the
present
emperor
and
his
reign
was
peaceful
miss
josephine
sleary
in
her
celebrated
graceful
equestrian
tyrolean
flower
act
was
then
announced
by
a
new
clown
who
humorously
said
cauliflower
act
and
sleary
appeared
leading
her
in
sleary
had
only
made
one
cut
at
the
clown
with
his
long
and
the
clown
had
only
said
if
you
do
it
again
i
ll
throw
the
horse
at
you
when
sissy
was
recognised
both
by
father
and
daughter
but
they
got
through
the
act
with
great
and
sleary
saving
for
the
first
instant
conveyed
no
more
expression
into
his
locomotive
eye
than
into
his
fixed
one
the
performance
seemed
a
little
long
to
sissy
and
louisa
particularly
when
it
stopped
to
afford
the
clown
an
opportunity
of
telling
sleary
who
said
indeed
sir
to
all
his
observations
in
the
calmest
way
and
with
his
eye
on
the
house
about
two
legs
sitting
on
three
legs
looking
at
one
leg
when
in
came
four
legs
and
laid
hold
of
one
leg
and
up
got
two
legs
caught
hold
of
three
legs
and
threw
em
at
four
legs
who
ran
away
with
one
leg
for
although
an
ingenious
allegory
relating
to
a
butcher
a
stool
a
dog
and
a
leg
of
mutton
this
narrative
consumed
time
and
they
were
in
great
suspense
at
last
however
little
josephine
made
her
curtsey
amid
great
applause
and
the
clown
left
alone
in
the
ring
had
just
warmed
himself
and
said
now
ll
have
a
turn
when
sissy
was
touched
on
the
shoulder
and
beckoned
out
she
took
louisa
with
her
and
they
were
received
by
sleary
in
a
very
little
private
apartment
with
canvas
sides
a
grass
floor
and
a
wooden
ceiling
all
aslant
on
which
the
box
company
stamped
their
approbation

white

so
scant
of

and
so
demonstrative
of

but
it
was
very
agreeable
to
see
them
crowding
about

very
natural
in
sissy
to
be
unable
to
refrain
from
tears

with
many

with

detained
sleary
no
longer
then
she
left
her
love
for
her
brother
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
and
she
and
sissy
went
away
until
later
in
the
afternoon
gradgrind
arrived
within
an
hour
afterwards
he
too
had
encountered
no
one
whom
he
knew
and
was
now
sanguine
with
sleary
s
assistance
of
getting
his
disgraced
son
to
liverpool
in
the
night
as
neither
of
the
three
could
be
his
companion
without
almost
identifying
him
under
any
disguise
he
prepared
a
letter
to
a
correspondent
whom
he
could
trust
beseeching
him
to
ship
the
bearer
off
at
any
cost
to
north
or
south
america
or
any
distant
part
of
the
world
to
which
he
could
be
the
most
speedily
and
privately
dispatched
this
done
they
walked
about
waiting
for
the
circus
to
be
quite
vacated
not
only
by
the
audience
but
by
the
company
and
by
the
horses
after
watching
it
a
long
time
they
saw
sleary
bring
out
a
chair
and
sit
down
by
the
smoking
as
if
that
were
his
signal
that
they
might
approach
your
thervant
thquire
was
his
cautious
salutation
as
they
passed
in
if
you
want
me
you
ll
find
me
here
you
muthn
t
mind
your
thon
having
a
comic
livery
they
all
three
went
in
and
gradgrind
sat
down
forlorn
on
the
clown
s
performing
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
ring
on
one
of
the
back
benches
remote
in
the
subdued
light
and
the
strangeness
of
the
place
sat
the
villainous
whelp
sulky
to
the
last
whom
he
had
the
misery
to
call
his
son
in
a
preposterous
coat
like
a
beadle
s
with
cuffs
and
flaps
exaggerated
to
an
unspeakable
extent
in
an
immense
waistcoat
buckled
shoes
and
a
mad
cocked
hat
with
nothing
fitting
him
and
everything
of
coarse
material
and
full
of
holes
with
seams
in
his
black
face
where
fear
and
heat
had
started
through
the
greasy
composition
daubed
all
over
it
anything
so
grimly
detestably
ridiculously
shameful
as
the
whelp
in
his
comic
livery
gradgrind
never
could
by
any
other
means
have
believed
in
weighable
and
measurable
fact
though
it
was
and
one
of
his
model
children
had
come
to
this
at
first
the
whelp
would
not
draw
any
nearer
but
persisted
in
remaining
up
there
by
himself
yielding
at
length
if
any
concession
so
sullenly
made
can
be
called
yielding
to
the
entreaties
of
louisa
he
disowned
came
down
bench
by
bench
until
he
stood
in
the
sawdust
on
the
verge
of
the
circle
as
far
as
possible
within
its
limits
from
where
his
father
sat
how
was
this
done
asked
the
father
how
was
what
done
moodily
answered
the
son
this
robbery
said
the
father
raising
his
voice
upon
the
word
i
forced
the
safe
myself
over
night
and
shut
it
up
ajar
before
i
went
away
i
had
had
the
key
that
was
found
made
long
before
i
dropped
it
that
morning
that
it
might
be
supposed
to
have
been
used
i
didn
t
take
the
money
all
at
once
i
pretended
to
put
my
balance
away
every
night
but
i
didn
t
now
you
know
all
about
if
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
on
me
said
the
father
it
would
have
shocked
me
less
than
this
i
don
t
see
why
grumbled
the
son
so
many
people
are
employed
in
situations
of
trust
so
many
people
out
of
so
many
will
be
dishonest
i
have
heard
you
talk
a
hundred
times
of
its
being
a
law
how
can
help
laws
you
have
comforted
others
with
such
things
father
comfort
yourself
the
father
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
the
son
stood
in
his
disgraceful
grotesqueness
biting
straw
his
hands
with
the
black
partly
worn
away
inside
looking
like
the
hands
of
a
monkey
the
evening
was
fast
closing
in
and
from
time
to
time
he
turned
the
whites
of
his
eyes
restlessly
and
impatiently
towards
his
father
they
were
the
only
parts
of
his
face
that
showed
any
life
or
expression
the
pigment
upon
it
was
so
thick
you
must
be
got
to
liverpool
and
sent
i
suppose
i
must
i
can
t
be
more
miserable
anywhere
whimpered
the
whelp
than
i
have
been
here
ever
since
i
can
remember
that
s
one
gradgrind
went
to
the
door
and
returned
with
sleary
to
whom
he
submitted
the
question
how
to
get
this
deplorable
object
away
why
i

been
thinking
of
it
thquire

gradgrind

up

i
ve
never
met
with
nothing
but

a
comic
gradgrind
rapidly
assented
sleary
rapidly
turned
out
from
a
box
a
smock
frock
a
felt
hat
and
other
essentials
the
whelp
rapidly
changed
clothes
behind
a
screen
of
baize
sleary
rapidly
brought
beer
and
washed
him
white
again
now
said
sleary
come
along
to

and
jump
up
behind
i

go
with

and

thuppothe

people
thay
farewell
to
your

with
which
he
delicately
retired
here
is
your
letter
said
gradgrind
all
necessary
means
will
be
provided
for
you
atone
by
repentance
and
better
conduct
for
the
shocking
action
you
have
committed
and
the
dreadful
consequences
to
which
it
has
led
give
me
your
hand
my
poor
boy
and
may
god
forgive
you
as
i
do
the
culprit
was
moved
to
a
few
abject
tears
by
these
words
and
their
pathetic
tone
but
when
louisa
opened
her
arms
he
repulsed
her
afresh
not
you
i
don
t
want
to
have
anything
to
say
to
you
o
tom
tom
do
we
end
so
after
all
my
love
after
all
your
love
he
returned
obdurately
pretty
love
leaving
old
bounderby
to
himself
and
packing
my
best
friend
harthouse
off
and
going
home
just
when
i
was
in
the
greatest
danger
pretty
love
that
coming
out
with
every
word
about
our
having
gone
to
that
place
when
you
saw
the
net
was
gathering
round
me
pretty
love
that
you
have
regularly
given
me
up
you
never
cared
for
tharp
th
the
word
said
sleary
at
the
door
they
all
confusedly
went
out
louisa
crying
to
him
that
she
forgave
him
and
loved
him
still
and
that
he
would
one
day
be
sorry
to
have
left
her
so
and
glad
to
think
of
these
her
last
words
far
away
when
some
one
ran
against
them
gradgrind
and
sissy
who
were
both
before
him
while
his
sister
yet
clung
to
his
shoulder
stopped
and
recoiled
for
there
was
bitzer
out
of
breath
his
thin
lips
parted
his
thin
nostrils
distended
his
white
eyelashes
quivering
his
colourless
face
more
colourless
than
ever
as
if
he
ran
himself
into
a
white
heat
when
other
people
ran
themselves
into
a
glow
there
he
stood
panting
and
heaving
as
if
he
had
never
stopped
since
the
night
now
long
ago
when
he
had
run
them
down
before
i
m
sorry
to
interfere
with
your
plans
said
bitzer
shaking
his
head
but
i
can
t
allow
myself
to
be
done
by
i
must
have
young
tom
he
mustn
t
be
got
away
by
here
he
is
in
a
smock
frock
and
i
must
have
him
by
the
collar
too
it
seemed
for
so
he
took
possession
of
him
chapter

philosophical
they
went
back
into
the
booth
sleary
shutting
the
door
to
keep
intruders
out
bitzer
still
holding
the
paralysed
culprit
by
the
collar
stood
in
the
ring
blinking
at
his
old
patron
through
the
darkness
of
the
twilight
bitzer
said
gradgrind
broken
down
and
miserably
submissive
to
him
have
you
a
heart
the
circulation
sir
returned
bitzer
smiling
at
the
oddity
of
the
question
couldn
t
be
carried
on
without
one
no
man
sir
acquainted
with
the
facts
established
by
harvey
relating
to
the
circulation
of
the
blood
can
doubt
that
i
have
a
is
it
accessible
cried
gradgrind
to
any
compassionate
influence
it
is
accessible
to
reason
sir
returned
the
excellent
young
man
and
to
nothing
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
gradgrind
s
face
as
white
as
the
pursuer
s
what
what
motive
in
you
have
for
preventing
the
escape
of
this
wretched
youth
said
gradgrind
and
crushing
his
miserable
father
see
his
sister
here
pity
us
sir
returned
bitzer
in
a
very
and
logical
manner
since
you
ask
me
what
motive
i
have
in
reason
for
taking
young
tom
back
to
coketown
it
is
only
reasonable
to
let
you
know
i
have
suspected
young
tom
of
this
from
the
first
i
had
had
my
eye
upon
him
before
that
time
for
i
knew
his
ways
i
have
kept
my
observations
to
myself
but
i
have
made
them
and
i
have
got
ample
proofs
against
him
now
besides
his
running
away
and
besides
his
own
confession
which
i
was
just
in
time
to
overhear
i
had
the
pleasure
of
watching
your
house
yesterday
morning
and
following
you
here
i
am
going
to
take
young
tom
back
to
coketown
in
order
to
deliver
him
over
to
bounderby
sir
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
bounderby
will
then
promote
me
to
young
tom
s
situation
and
i
wish
to
have
his
situation
sir
for
it
will
be
a
rise
to
me
and
will
do
me
if
this
is
solely
a
question
of
with
gradgrind
began
i
beg
your
pardon
for
interrupting
you
sir
returned
bitzer
but
i
am
sure
you
know
that
the
whole
social
system
is
a
question
of
what
you
must
always
appeal
to
is
a
person
s
it
s
your
only
hold
we
are
so
constituted
i
was
brought
up
in
that
catechism
when
i
was
very
young
sir
as
you
are
what
sum
of
money
said
gradgrind
will
you
set
against
your
expected
promotion
thank
you
sir
returned
bitzer
for
hinting
at
the
proposal
but
i
will
not
set
any
sum
against
it
knowing
that
your
clear
head
would
propose
that
alternative
i
have
gone
over
the
calculations
in
my
mind
and
i
find
that
to
compound
a
felony
even
on
very
high
terms
indeed
would
not
be
as
safe
and
good
for
me
as
my
improved
prospects
in
the
bitzer
said
gradgrind
stretching
out
his
hands
as
though
he
would
have
said
see
how
miserable
i
am
bitzer
i
have
but
one
chance
left
to
soften
you
you
were
many
years
at
my
school
if
in
remembrance
of
the
pains
bestowed
upon
you
there
you
can
persuade
yourself
in
any
degree
to
disregard
your
present
interest
and
release
my
son
i
entreat
and
pray
you
to
give
him
the
benefit
of
that
i
really
wonder
sir
rejoined
the
old
pupil
in
an
argumentative
manner
to
find
you
taking
a
position
so
untenable
my
schooling
was
paid
for
it
was
a
bargain
and
when
i
came
away
the
bargain
it
was
a
fundamental
principle
of
the
gradgrind
philosophy
that
everything
was
to
be
paid
for
nobody
was
ever
on
any
account
to
give
anybody
anything
or
render
anybody
help
without
purchase
gratitude
was
to
be
abolished
and
the
virtues
springing
from
it
were
not
to
be
every
inch
of
the
existence
of
mankind
from
birth
to
death
was
to
be
a
bargain
across
a
counter
and
if
we
didn
t
get
to
heaven
that
way
it
was
not
a
place
and
we
had
no
business
there
i
don
t
deny
added
bitzer
that
my
schooling
was
cheap
but
that
comes
right
sir
i
was
made
in
the
cheapest
market
and
have
to
dispose
of
myself
in
the
he
was
a
little
troubled
here
by
louisa
and
sissy
crying
pray
don
t
do
that
said
he
it
s
of
no
use
doing
that
it
only
worries
you
seem
to
think
that
i
have
some
animosity
against
young
tom
whereas
i
have
none
at
all
i
am
only
going
on
the
reasonable
grounds
i
have
mentioned
to
take
him
back
to
coketown
if
he
was
to
resist
i
should
set
up
the
cry
of
stop
thief
but
he
won
t
resist
you
may
depend
upon
sleary
who
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
rolling
eye
as
immovably
jammed
in
his
head
as
his
fixed
one
had
listened
to
these
doctrines
with
profound
attention
here
stepped
forward
thquire
you
know
perfectly
well
and
your
daughter
knowth
perfectly
well
better
than
you
becauthe
i
thed
it
to
her
that
i
didn

done
and
that
i
didn

to

not

i
only

then
it
wath

thkylarking
however
thith
young
man
having
made
it
known
to
be
a
robbery
of

too
theriouth
a
thing
for

to

more
but
i
ll
do
fresh
lamentations
from
louisa
and
deeper
affliction
on
gradgrind
s
part
followed
this
desertion
of
them
by
their
last
friend
but
sissy
glanced
at
him
with
great
attention
nor
did
she
in
her
own
breast
misunderstand
him
as
they
were
all
going
out
again
he
favoured
her
with
one
slight
roll
of
his
movable
eye
desiring
her
to
linger
behind
as
he
locked
the
door
he
said
excitedly

in
ten
minutes
childers
sauntering
about

a
pair
of

had
his
cue
and
sleary

it
was
a
fine
sight
to
behold
the
learned
dog
barking
round
it
and
sleary
instructing
him
with
his
one
practicable
eye
that
bitzer
was
the
object
of
his
particular
attentions
soon
after
dark
they
all
three
got
in
and
started
the
learned
dog
a
formidable
creature
already
pinning
bitzer
with
his
eye
and
sticking
close
to
the
wheel
on
his
side
that
he
might
be
ready
for
him
in
the
event
of
his
showing
the
slightest
disposition
to
alight
the
other

sat
up
at

again
to

it
that
i

tho

of

chapter
ix

it
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
see
anything
in
the
sphere
of
a
vain
blusterer
before
the
vain
blusterer
sees
it
himself
bounderby
felt
that
sparsit
had
audaciously
anticipated
him
and
presumed
to
be
wiser
than
he
inappeasably
indignant
with
her
for
her
triumphant
discovery
of
pegler
he
turned
this
presumption
on
the
part
of
a
woman
in
her
dependent
position
over
and
over
in
his
mind
until
it
accumulated
with
turning
like
a
great
snowball
at
last
he
made
the
discovery
that
to
discharge
this
highly
connected
have
it
in
his
power
to
say
she
was
a
woman
of
family
and
wanted
to
stick
to
me
but
i
wouldn
t
have
it
and
got
rid
of
her
be
to
get
the
utmost
possible
amount
of
crowning
glory
out
of
the
connection
and
at
the
same
time
to
punish
sparsit
according
to
her
deserts
filled
fuller
than
ever
with
this
great
idea
bounderby
came
in
to
lunch
and
sat
himself
down
in
the
of
former
days
where
his
portrait
was
sparsit
sat
by
the
fire
with
her
foot
in
her
cotton
stirrup
little
thinking
whither
she
was
posting
since
the
pegler
affair
this
gentlewoman
had
covered
her
pity
for
bounderby
with
a
veil
of
quiet
melancholy
and
contrition
in
virtue
thereof
it
had
become
her
habit
to
assume
a
woful
look
which
woful
look
she
now
bestowed
upon
her
patron
what
s
the
matter
now
ma
am
said
bounderby
in
a
very
short
rough
way
pray
sir
returned
sparsit
do
not
bite
my
nose
bite
your
nose
off
ma
am
repeated
bounderby
nose
meaning
as
sparsit
conceived
that
it
was
too
developed
a
nose
for
the
purpose
after
which
offensive
implication
he
cut
himself
a
crust
of
bread
and
threw
the
knife
down
with
a
noise
sparsit
took
her
foot
out
of
her
stirrup
and
said
mr
bounderby
sir
well
ma
am
retorted
bounderby
what
are
you
staring
at
may
i
ask
sir
said
sparsit
have
you
been
ruffled
this
morning
yes
ma
may
i
inquire
sir
pursued
the
injured
woman
whether
am
the
unfortunate
cause
of
your
having
lost
your
temper
now
i
ll
tell
you
what
ma
am
said
bounderby
i
am
not
come
here
to
be
bullied
a
female
may
be
highly
connected
but
she
can
t
be
permitted
to
bother
and
badger
a
man
in
my
position
and
i
am
not
going
to
put
up
with
bounderby
felt
it
necessary
to
get
on
foreseeing
that
if
he
allowed
of
details
he
would
be
beaten
sparsit
first
elevated
then
knitted
her
coriolanian
eyebrows
gathered
up
her
work
into
its
proper
basket
and
rose
sir
said
she
majestically
it
is
apparent
to
me
that
i
am
in
your
way
at
present
i
will
retire
to
my
own
allow
me
to
open
the
door
ma
thank
you
sir
i
can
do
it
for
you
had
better
allow
me
ma
am
said
bounderby
passing
her
and
getting
his
hand
upon
the
lock
because
i
can
take
the
opportunity
of
saying
a
word
to
you
before
you
go
sparsit
ma
am
i
rather
think
you
are
cramped
here
do
you
know
it
appears
to
me
that
under
my
humble
roof
there
s
hardly
opening
enough
for
a
lady
of
your
genius
in
other
people
s
sparsit
gave
him
a
look
of
the
darkest
scorn
and
said
with
great
politeness
really
sir
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
you
see
since
the
late
affairs
have
happened
ma
am
said
bounderby
and
it
appears
to
my
poor
oh
pray
sir
sparsit
interposed
with
sprightly
cheerfulness
don
t
disparage
your
judgment
everybody
knows
how
unerring
bounderby
s
judgment
is
everybody
has
had
proofs
of
it
it
must
be
the
theme
of
general
conversation
disparage
anything
in
yourself
but
your
judgment
sir
said
sparsit
laughing
bounderby
very
red
and
uncomfortable
resumed
it
appears
to
me
ma
am
i
say
that
a
different
sort
of
establishment
altogether
would
bring
out
a
lady
of
powers
such
an
establishment
as
your
relation
lady
scadgers
s
now
don
t
you
think
you
might
find
some
affairs
there
ma
am
to
interfere
with
it
never
occurred
to
me
before
sir
returned
sparsit
but
now
you
mention
it
should
think
it
highly
then
suppose
you
try
ma
am
said
bounderby
laying
an
envelope
with
a
cheque
in
it
in
her
little
basket
you
can
take
your
own
time
for
going
ma
am
but
perhaps
in
the
meanwhile
it
will
be
more
agreeable
to
a
lady
of
your
powers
of
mind
to
eat
her
meals
by
herself
and
not
to
be
intruded
upon
i
really
ought
to
apologise
to
only
josiah
bounderby
of
having
stood
in
your
light
so
pray
don
t
name
it
sir
returned
sparsit
if
that
portrait
could
speak
it
has
the
advantage
over
the
original
of
not
possessing
the
power
of
committing
itself
and
disgusting
others
would
testify
that
a
long
period
has
elapsed
since
i
first
habitually
addressed
it
as
the
picture
of
a
noodle
nothing
that
a
noodle
does
can
awaken
surprise
or
indignation
the
proceedings
of
a
noodle
can
only
inspire
thus
saying
sparsit
with
her
roman
features
like
a
medal
struck
to
commemorate
her
scorn
of
bounderby
surveyed
him
fixedly
from
head
to
foot
swept
disdainfully
past
him
and
ascended
the
staircase
bounderby
closed
the
door
and
stood
before
the
fire
projecting
himself
after
his
old
explosive
manner
into
his
into
futurity
into
how
much
of
futurity
he
saw
sparsit
fighting
out
a
daily
fight
at
the
points
of
all
the
weapons
in
the
female
armoury
with
the
grudging
smarting
peevish
tormenting
lady
scadgers
still
laid
up
in
bed
with
her
mysterious
leg
and
gobbling
her
insufficient
income
down
by
about
the
middle
of
every
quarter
in
a
mean
little
airless
lodging
a
mere
closet
for
one
a
mere
crib
for
two
but
did
he
see
more
did
he
catch
any
glimpse
of
himself
making
a
show
of
bitzer
to
strangers
as
the
rising
young
man
so
devoted
to
his
master
s
great
merits
who
had
won
young
tom
s
place
and
had
almost
captured
young
tom
himself
in
the
times
when
by
various
rascals
he
was
spirited
away
did
he
see
any
faint
reflection
of
his
own
image
making
a
will
whereby
humbugs
past
years
of
age
each
taking
upon
himself
the
name
josiah
bounderby
of
coketown
should
for
ever
dine
in
bounderby
hall
for
ever
lodge
in
bounderby
buildings
for
ever
attend
a
bounderby
chapel
for
ever
go
to
sleep
under
a
bounderby
chaplain
for
ever
be
supported
out
of
a
bounderby
estate
and
for
ever
nauseate
all
healthy
stomachs
with
a
vast
amount
of
bounderby
balderdash
and
bluster
had
he
any
prescience
of
the
day
five
years
to
come
when
josiah
bounderby
of
coketown
was
to
die
of
a
fit
in
the
coketown
street
and
this
same
precious
will
was
to
begin
its
long
career
of
quibble
plunder
false
pretences
vile
example
little
service
and
much
law
probably
not
yet
the
portrait
was
to
see
it
all
out
here
was
gradgrind
on
the
same
day
and
in
the
same
hour
sitting
thoughtful
in
his
own
room
how
much
of
futurity
did
see
did
he
see
himself
a
decrepit
man
bending
his
hitherto
inflexible
theories
to
appointed
circumstances
making
his
facts
and
figures
subservient
to
faith
hope
and
charity
and
no
longer
trying
to
grind
that
heavenly
trio
in
his
dusty
little
mills
did
he
catch
sight
of
himself
therefore
much
despised
by
his
late
political
associates
did
he
see
them
in
the
era
of
its
being
quite
settled
that
the
national
dustmen
have
only
to
do
with
one
another
and
owe
no
duty
to
an
abstraction
called
a
people
taunting
the
honourable
gentleman
with
this
and
with
that
and
with
what
not
five
nights
until
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
probably
he
had
that
much
foreknowledge
knowing
his
men
here
was
louisa
on
the
night
of
the
same
day
watching
the
fire
as
in
days
of
yore
though
with
a
gentler
and
a
humbler
face
how
much
of
the
future
might
arise
before
vision
broadsides
in
the
streets
signed
with
her
father
s
name
exonerating
the
late
stephen
blackpool
weaver
from
misplaced
suspicion
and
publishing
the
guilt
of
his
own
son
with
such
extenuation
as
his
years
and
temptation
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
add
his
education
might
beseech
were
of
the
present
so
stephen
blackpool
s
tombstone
with
her
father
s
record
of
his
death
was
almost
of
the
present
for
she
knew
it
was
to
be
these
things
she
could
plainly
see
but
how
much
of
the
future
a
working
woman
christened
rachael
after
a
long
illness
once
again
appearing
at
the
ringing
of
the
factory
bell
and
passing
to
and
fro
at
the
set
hours
among
the
coketown
hands
a
woman
of
pensive
beauty
always
dressed
in
black
but
and
serene
and
even
cheerful
who
of
all
the
people
in
the
place
alone
appeared
to
have
compassion
on
a
degraded
drunken
wretch
of
her
own
sex
who
was
sometimes
seen
in
the
town
secretly
begging
of
her
and
crying
to
her
a
woman
working
ever
working
but
content
to
do
it
and
preferring
to
do
it
as
her
natural
lot
until
she
should
be
too
old
to
labour
any
more
did
louisa
see
this
such
a
thing
was
to
be
a
lonely
brother
many
thousands
of
miles
away
writing
on
paper
blotted
with
tears
that
her
words
had
too
soon
come
true
and
that
all
the
treasures
in
the
world
would
be
cheaply
bartered
for
a
sight
of
her
dear
face
at
length
this
brother
coming
nearer
home
with
hope
of
seeing
her
and
being
delayed
by
illness
and
then
a
letter
in
a
strange
hand
saying
he
died
in
hospital
of
fever
such
a
day
and
died
in
penitence
and
love
of
you
his
last
word
being
your
name
did
louisa
see
these
things
such
things
were
to
be
herself
again
a
watchful
of
her
children
ever
careful
that
they
should
have
a
childhood
of
the
mind
no
less
than
a
childhood
of
the
body
as
knowing
it
to
be
even
a
more
beautiful
thing
and
a
possession
any
hoarded
scrap
of
which
is
a
blessing
and
happiness
to
the
wisest
did
louisa
see
this
such
a
thing
was
never
to
be
but
happy
sissy
s
happy
children
loving
her
all
children
loving
her
she
grown
learned
in
childish
lore
thinking
no
innocent
and
pretty
fancy
ever
to
be
despised
trying
hard
to
know
her
humbler
and
to
beautify
their
lives
of
machinery
and
reality
with
those
imaginative
graces
and
delights
without
which
the
heart
of
infancy
will
wither
up
the
sturdiest
physical
manhood
will
be
morally
stark
death
and
the
plainest
national
prosperity
figures
can
show

be
the
writing
on

of
no
fantastic

or
