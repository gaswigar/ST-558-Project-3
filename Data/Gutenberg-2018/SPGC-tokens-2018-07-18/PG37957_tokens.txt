preface
the
object
of
the
present
volume
is
to
indicate
the
character
and
approximately
the
extent
of
the
changes
produced
by
human
action
in
the
physical
conditions
of
the
globe
we
inhabit
to
point
out
the
dangers
of
imprudence
and
the
necessity
of
caution
in
all
operations
which
on
a
large
scale
interfere
with
the
spontaneous
arrangements
of
the
organic
or
the
inorganic
world
to
suggest
the
possibility
and
the
importance
of
the
restoration
of
disturbed
harmonies
and
the
material
improvement
of
waste
and
exhausted
regions
and
incidentally
to
illustrate
the
doctrine
that
man
is
in
both
kind
and
degree
a
power
of
a
higher
order
than
any
of
the
other
forms
of
animated
life
which
like
him
are
nourished
at
the
table
of
bounteous
nature
in
the
rudest
stages
of
life
man
depends
upon
spontaneous
animal
and
vegetable
growth
for
food
and
clothing
and
his
consumption
of
such
products
consequently
diminishes
the
numerical
abundance
of
the
species
which
serve
his
uses
at
more
advanced
periods
he
protects
and
propagates
certain
esculent
vegetables
and
certain
fowls
and
quadrupeds
and
at
the
same
time
wars
upon
rival
organisms
which
prey
upon
these
objects
of
his
care
or
obstruct
the
increase
of
their
numbers
hence
the
action
of
man
upon
the
organic
world
tends
to
subvert
the
original
balance
of
its
species
and
while
it
reduces
the
numbers
of
some
of
them
or
even
extirpates
them
altogether
it
multiplies
other
forms
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
the
extension
of
agricultural
and
pastoral
industry
involves
an
enlargement
of
the
sphere
of
man
domain
by
encroachment
upon
the
forests
which
once
covered
the
greater
part
of
the
earth
surface
otherwise
adapted
to
his
occupation
the
felling
of
the
woods
has
been
attended
with
momentous
consequences
to
the
drainage
of
the
soil
to
the
external
configuration
of
its
surface
and
probably
also
to
local
climate
and
the
importance
of
human
life
as
a
transforming
power
is
perhaps
more
clearly
demonstrable
in
the
influence
man
has
thus
exerted
upon
superficial
geography
than
in
any
other
result
of
his
material
effort
lands
won
from
the
woods
must
be
both
drained
and
irrigated
river
banks
and
maritime
coasts
must
be
secured
by
means
of
artificial
bulwarks
against
inundation
by
inland
and
by
ocean
floods
and
the
needs
of
commerce
require
the
improvement
of
natural
and
the
construction
of
artificial
channels
of
navigation
thus
man
is
compelled
to
extend
over
the
unstable
waters
the
empire
he
had
already
founded
upon
the
solid
land
the
upheaval
of
the
bed
of
seas
and
the
movements
of
water
and
of
wind
expose
vast
deposits
of
sand
which
occupy
space
required
for
the
convenience
of
man
and
often
by
the
drifting
of
their
particles
overwhelm
the
fields
of
human
industry
with
invasions
as
disastrous
as
the
incursions
of
the
ocean
on
the
other
hand
on
many
coasts
sand
hills
both
protect
the
shores
from
erosion
by
the
waves
and
currents
and
shelter
valuable
grounds
from
blasting
sea
winds
man
therefore
must
sometimes
resist
sometimes
promote
the
formation
and
growth
of
dunes
and
subject
the
barren
and
flying
sands
to
the
same
obedience
to
his
will
to
which
he
has
reduced
other
forms
of
terrestrial
surface
besides
these
old
and
comparatively
familiar
methods
of
material
improvement
modern
ambition
aspires
to
yet
grander
achievements
in
the
conquest
of
physical
nature
and
projects
are
meditated
which
quite
eclipse
the
boldest
enterprises
hitherto
undertaken
for
the
modification
of
geographical
surface
the
natural
character
of
the
various
fields
where
human
industry
has
effected
revolutions
so
important
and
where
the
multiplying
population
and
the
impoverished
resources
of
the
globe
demand
new
triumphs
of
mind
over
matter
suggests
a
corresponding
division
of
the
general
subject
and
i
have
conformed
the
distribution
of
the
several
topics
to
the
chronological
succession
in
which
man
must
be
supposed
to
have
extended
his
sway
over
the
different
provinces
of
his
material
kingdom
i
have
then
in
the
introductory
chapter
stated
in
a
comprehensive
way
the
general
effects
and
the
prospective
consequences
of
human
action
upon
the
earth
surface
and
the
life
which
peoples
it
this
chapter
is
followed
by
four
others
in
which
i
have
traced
the
history
of
industry
as
exerted
upon
animal
and
vegetable
life
upon
the
woods
upon
the
waters
and
upon
the
sands
and
to
these
i
have
added
a
concluding
chapter
upon
probable
and
possible
geographical
revolutions
yet
to
be
effected
by
the
art
of
man
i
have
only
to
add
what
indeed
sufficiently
appears
upon
every
page
of
the
volume
that
i
address
myself
not
to
professed
physicists
but
to
the
general
intelligence
of
educated
observing
and
thinking
men
and
that
my
purpose
is
rather
to
make
practical
suggestions
than
to
indulge
in
theoretical
speculations
properly
suited
to
a
different
class
from
that
to
which
those
for
whom
i
write
belong

gold

indeed
were
not

in

which
has
proved
so
baneful
to
the
industry
of
lands
richer

most

not

whose
wealth
commanded
whatever
the

world
could
contribute
to
augment
the
material
splendor
of
their
social
life
were
scarcely
native
to
the
territory
of
the
empire
but
the
comparative
rarity
of
these
gems
in
europe
at
somewhat
earlier
periods
was
perhaps
the
very
circumstance
that
led
the
cunning
artists
of
classic
antiquity
to
enrich
softer
stones
with
engravings
which
invest
the
common
onyx
and
carnelian
with
a
worth
surpassing
in
cultivated
eyes
the
lustre
of
the
most
brilliant
oriental
jewels
of
these
manifold
blessings

of
the

distribution
of

the
relative
disposition
of

and
water
the
plenty
of
the
sea
the
composition
of
the
soil
and
the
raw
material
of
some
of
the
arts
were
wholly
gratuitous
gifts
yet
the
spontaneous
nature
of
europe
of
western
asia
of
libya
neither
fed
nor
clothed
the
civilized
inhabitants
of
those
provinces
every
loaf
was
eaten
in
the
sweat
of
the
brow
all
must
be
earned
by
toil
but
toil
was
nowhere
else
rewarded
by
so
generous
wages
for
nowhere
would
a
given
amount
of
intelligent
labor
produce
so
abundant
and
at
the
same
time
so
varied
returns
of
the
good
things
of
material
existence
the
luxuriant
harvests
of
cereals
that
waved
on
every
field
from
the
shores
of
the
rhine
to
the
banks
of
the
nile
the
vines
that
festooned
the
hillsides
of
syria
of
italy
and
of
greece
the
olives
of
spain
the
fruits
of
the
gardens
of
the
hesperides
the
domestic
quadrupeds
and
fowls
known
in
ancient
rural
husbandry
all
these
were
original
products
of
foreign
climes
naturalized
in
new
homes
and
gradually
ennobled
by
the
art
of
man
while
centuries
of
persevering
labor
were
expelling
the
wild
vegetation
and
fitting
the
earth
for
the
production
of
more
generous
growths
only
for
the
sense
of
landscape
beauty
did
unaided
nature
make
provision
indeed
the
very
commonness
of
this
source
of
refined
enjoyment
seems
to
have
deprived
it
of
half
its
value
and
it
was
only
in
the
infancy
of
lands
where
all
the
earth
was
fair
that
greek
and
roman
humanity
had
sympathy
enough
with
the
inanimate
world
to
be
alive
to
the
charms
of
rural
and
of
mountain
scenery
in
later
generations
when
the
glories
of
the
landscape
had
been
heightened
by
plantation
and
decorative
architecture
and
other
forms
of
picturesque
improvement
the
poets
of
greece
and
rome
were
blinded
by
excess
of
light
and
became
at
last
almost
insensible
to
beauties
that
now
even
in
their
degraded
state
enchant
every
eye
except
too
often
those
which
a
lifelong
familiarity
has
dulled
to
their
attractions
decay
of
the
territory
of
the
roman
empire
and
of
other
parts
of
the
old
if
we
compare
the
present
physical
condition
of
the
countries
of
which
i
am
speaking
with
the
descriptions
that
ancient
historians
and
geographers
have
given
of
their
fertility
and
general
capability
of
ministering
to
human
uses
we
shall
find
that
more
than
one
half
of
their
whole
extent
including
the
provinces
most
celebrated
for
the
profusion
and
variety
of
their
spontaneous
and
their
cultivated
products
and
for
the
wealth
and
social
advancement
of
their
inhabitants
is
either
deserted
by
civilized
man
and
surrendered
to
hopeless
desolation
or
at
least
greatly
reduced
in
both
productiveness
and
population
vast
forests
have
disappeared
from
mountain
spurs
and
ridges
the
vegetable
earth
accumulated
beneath
the
trees
by
the
decay
of
leaves
and
fallen
trunks
the
soil
of
the
alpine
pastures
which
skirted
and
indented
the
woods
and
the
mould
of
the
upland
fields
are
washed
away
meadows
once
fertilized
by
irrigation
are
waste
and
unproductive
because
the
cisterns
and
reservoirs
that
supplied
the
ancient
canals
are
broken
or
the
springs
that
fed
them
dried
up
rivers
famous
in
history
and
song
have
shrunk
to
humble
brooklets
the
willows
that
ornamented
and
protected
the
banks
of
the
lesser
watercourses
are
gone
and
the
rivulets
have
ceased
to
exist
as
perennial
currents
because
the
little
water
that
finds
its
way
into
their
old
channels
is
evaporated
by
the
droughts
of
summer
or
absorbed
by
the
parched
earth
before
it
reaches
the
lowlands
the
beds
of
the
brooks
have
widened
into
broad
expanses
of
pebbles
and
gravel
over
which
though
in
the
hot
season
passed
dryshod
in
winter
sealike
torrents
thunder
the
entrances
of
navigable
streams
are
obstructed
by
sandbars
and
harbors
once
marts
of
an
extensive
commerce
are
shoaled
by
the
deposits
of
the
rivers
at
whose
mouths
they
lie
the
elevation
of
the
beds
of
estuaries
and
the
consequently
diminished
velocity
of
the
streams
which
flow
into
them
have
converted
thousands
of
leagues
of
shallow
sea
and
fertile
lowland
into
unproductive
and
miasmatic
morasses
besides
the
direct
testimony
of
history
to
the
ancient
fertility
of
the
regions
to
which
i
refer
northern
africa
the
greater
arabian
peninsula
syria
mesopotamia
armenia
and
many
other
provinces
of

minor
greece
sicily
and
parts
of
even
italy
and
spain
the
multitude
and
extent
of
yet
remaining
architectural
ruins
and
of
decayed
works
of
internal
improvement
show
that
at
former
epochs
a
dense
population
inhabited
those
now
lonely
districts
such
a
population
could
have
been
sustained
only
by
a
productiveness
of
soil
of
which
we
at
present
discover
but
slender
traces
and
the
abundance
derived
from
that
fertility
serves
to
explain
how
large
armies
like
those
of
the
ancient
persians
and
of
the
crusaders
and
the
tartars
in
later
ages
could
without
an
organized
commissariat
secure
adequate
supplies
in
long
marches
through
territories
which
in
our
times
would
scarcely
afford
forage
for
a
single
regiment
it
appears
then
that
the
fairest
and
fruitfulest
provinces
of
the
roman
empire
precisely
that
portion
of
terrestrial
surface
in
short
which
about
the
commencement
of
the
christian
era
was
endowed
with
the
greatest
superiority
of
soil
climate
and
position
which
had
been
carried
to
the
highest
pitch
of
physical
improvement
and
which
thus
combined
the
natural
and
artificial
conditions
best
fitting
it
for
the
habitation
and
enjoyment
of
a
dense
and
highly
refined
and
cultivated
population
is
now
completely
exhausted
of
its
fertility
or
so
diminished
in
productiveness
as
with
the
exception
of
a
few
favored
oases
that
have
escaped
the
general
ruin
to
be
no
longer
capable
of
affording
sustenance
to
civilized
man
if
to
this
realm
of
desolation
we
add
the
now
wasted
and
solitary
soils
of
persia
and
the
remoter
east
that
once
fed
their
millions
with
milk
and
honey
we
shall
see
that
a
territory
larger
than
all
europe
the
abundance
of
which
sustained
in
bygone
centuries
a
population
scarcely
inferior
to
that
of
the
whole
christian
world
at
the
present
day
has
been
entirely
withdrawn
from
human
use
or
at
best
is
thinly
inhabited
by
tribes
too
few
in
numbers
too
poor
in
superfluous
products
and
too
little
advanced
in
culture
and
the
social
arts
to
contribute
anything
to
the
general
moral
or
material
interests
of
the
great
commonwealth
of
man
of
this
the
decay
of
these
once
flourishing
countries
is
partly
due
no
doubt
to
that
class
of
geological
causes
whose
action
we
can
neither
resist
nor
guide
and
partly
also
to
the
direct

it
is
in

either
the

of

or
an
incidental
consequence
of

of

the

half
of
the

of

is
first
the
brutal
and
exhausting
despotism
which
rome
herself
exercised
over
her
conquered

and
even
over
her
italian

then
the
host
of
temporal
and

tyrannies

she
left

in

form
of

or
of

still
brood
over

on

in

taxes

the

of
the

scarcely
discharge
she
drained
them
of
their

by

she
impoverished
the
peasantry
by
forced
and
unpaid
labor
on
public
works
she
hampered
industry
and
internal
commerce
by
absurd
restrictions
and
unwise
regulations
hence
large
tracts
of
land
were
left
uncultivated
or
altogether
deserted
and
exposed
to
all
the
destructive
forces
which
act
with
such
energy
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
when
it
is
deprived
of
those
protections
by
which
nature
originally
guarded
it
and
for
which
in
husbandry
human
ingenuity
has
contrived
more
or
less
efficient
substitutes
similar
abuses
have
tended
to
perpetuate
and
extend
these
evils
in
later
ages
and
it
is
but
recently
that
even
in
the
most
populous
parts
of
europe
public
attention
has
been
half
awakened
to
the
necessity
of
restoring
the
disturbed
harmonies
of
nature
whose
influences
are
so
propitious
to
all
her
organic
offspring
of
repaying
to
our
great
mother
the
debt
which
the
prodigality
and
the
thriftlessness
of
former
generations
have
imposed
upon
their
successors
thus
fulfilling
the
command
of
religion
and
of
practical
wisdom
to
use
this
world
as
not
abusing
it
school
of
the
labors
of
humboldt
of
ritter
of
guyot
and
their
followers
have
given
to
the
science
of
geography
a
more
philosophical
and
at
the
same
time
a
more
imaginative
character
than
it
had
received
from
the
hands
of
their
predecessors
perhaps
the
most
interesting
field
of
speculation
thrown
open
by
the
new
school
to
the
cultivators
of
this
attractive
study
is
the
inquiry
how
far
external
physical
conditions
and
especially
the
configuration
of
the
earth
surface
and
the
distribution
outline
and
relative
position
of
land
and
water
have
influenced
the
social
life
and
social
progress
of
man
of
man
on
but
as
we
have
seen
man
has
reacted
upon
organized
and
inorganic
nature
and
thereby
modified
if
not
determined
the
material
structure
of
his
earthly
home
the
measure
of
that
reaction
manifestly
constitutes
a
very
important
element
in
the
appreciation
of
the
relations
between
mind
and
matter
as
well
as
in
the
discussion
of
many
purely
physical
problems
but
though
the
subject
has
been
incidentally
touched
upon
by
many
geographers
and
treated
with
much
fulness
of
detail
in
regard
to
certain
limited
fields
of
human
effort
and
to
certain
specific
effects
of
human
action
it
has
not
as
a
whole
so
far
as
i
know
been
made
matter
of
special
observation
or
of
historical
research
by
any
scientific
inquirer
indeed
until
the
influence
of
physical
geography
upon
human
life
was
recognized
as
a
distinct
branch
of
philosophical
investigation
there
was
no
motive
for
the
pursuit
of
such
speculations
and
it
was
desirable
to
inquire
whether
we
have
or
can
become
the
architects
of
our
own
abiding
place
only
when
it
was
known
how
the
mode
of
our
physical
moral
and
intellectual
being
is
affected
by
the
character
of
the
home
which
providence
has
appointed
and
we
have
fashioned
for
our
material
habitation
it
is
still
too
early
to
attempt
scientific
method
in
discussing
this
problem
nor
is
our
present
store
of
the
necessary
facts
by
any
means
complete
enough
to
warrant
me
in
promising
any
approach
to
fulness
of
statement
respecting
them
systematic
observation
in
relation
to
this
subject
has
hardly
yet
begun
and
the
scattered
data
which
have
chanced
to
be
recorded
have
never
been
collected
it
has
now
no
place
in
the
general
scheme
of
physical
science
and
is
matter
of
suggestion
and
speculation
only
not
of
established
and
positive
conclusion
at
present
then
all
that
i
can
hope
is
to
excite
an
interest
in
a
topic
of
much
economical
importance
by
pointing
out
the
directions
and
illustrating
the
modes
in
which
human
action
has
been
or
may
be
most
injurious
or
most
beneficial
in
its
influence
upon
the
physical
conditions
of
the
earth
we
inhabit
of
in
these
pages
as
in
all
i
have
ever
written
or
propose
to
write
it
is
my
aim
to
stimulate
not
to
satisfy
curiosity
and
it
is
no
part
of
my
object
to
save
my
readers
the
labor
of
observation
or
of
thought
for
labor
is
life
and
death
lives
where
power
lives
unused
self
is
the
schoolmaster
whose
lessons
are
best
worth
his
wages
and
since
the
subject
i
am
considering
has
not
yet
become
a
branch
of
formal
instruction
those
whom
it
may
interest
can
fortunately
have
no
pedagogue
but
themselves
to
the
natural
philosopher
the
descriptive
poet
the
painter
and
the
sculptor
as
well
as
to
the
common
observer
the
power
most
important
to
cultivate
and
at
the
same
time
hardest
to
acquire
is
that
of
seeing
what
is
before
him
sight
is
a
faculty
seeing
an
art
the
eye
is
a
physical
but
not
a
apparatus
and
in
general
it
sees
only
what
it
seeks
like
a
mirror
it
reflects
objects
presented
to
it
but
it
may
be
as
insensible
as
a
mirror
and
it
does
not
necessarily
perceive
what
it
reflects
it
is
disputed
whether
the
purely
material
sensibility
of
the
eye
is
capable
of
improvement
and
cultivation
it
has
been
maintained
by
high
authority
that
the
natural
acuteness
of
none
of
our
sensuous
faculties
can
be
heightened
by
use
and
hence
that
the
minutest
details
of
the
image
formed
on
the
retina
are
as
perfect
in
the
most
untrained
as
in
the
most
thoroughly
disciplined
organ
this
may
well
be
doubted
and
it
is
agreed
on
all
hands
that
the
power
of
multifarious
perception
and
rapid
discrimination
may
be
immensely
increased
by
practice
this
exercise
of
the
eye
i
desire
to
promote
and
next
to
moral
and
religious
doctrine
i
know
no
more
important
practical
lessons
in
this
earthly
life
of
ours
which
to
the
wise
man
is
a
school
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
than
those
relating
to
the
employment
of
the
sense
of
vision
in
the
study
of
nature
the
pursuit
of
physical
geography
embracing
actual
observation
of
terrestrial
surface
affords
to
the
eye
the
best
general
training
that
is
accessible
to
all
the
majority
of
even
cultivated
men
have
not
the
time
and
means
of
acquiring
anything
beyond
a
very
superficial
acquaintance
with
any
branch
of
physical
knowledge
natural
science
has
become
so
vastly
extended
its
recorded
facts
and
its
unanswered
questions
so
immensely
multiplied
that
every
strictly
scientific
man
must
be
a
specialist
and
confine
the
researches
of
a
whole
life
within
a
comparatively
narrow
circle
the
study
i
am
recommending
in
the
view
i
propose
to
take
of
it
is
yet
in
that
imperfectly
developed
state
which
allows
its
votaries
to
occupy
themselves
with
such
broad
and
general
views
as
are
attainable
by
every
person
of
culture
and
it
does
not
now
require
a
knowledge
of
special
details
which
only
years
of
application
can
master
it
may
be
profitably
pursued
by
all
and
every
traveller
every
lover
of
rural
scenery
every
agriculturist
who
will
wisely
use
the
gift
of
sight
may
add
valuable
contributions
to
the
common
stock
of
knowledge
on
a
subject
which
as
i
hope
to
convince
my
readers
though
long
neglected
and
now
inartificially
presented
is
not
only
a
very
important
but
a
very
interesting
field
of
inquiry
and
geological
the
revolutions
of
the
seasons
with
their
alternations
of
temperature
and
of
length
of
day
and
night
the
climates
of
different
zones
and
the
general
condition
and
movements
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
seas
depend
upon
causes
for
the
most
part
cosmical
and
of
course
wholly
beyond
our
control
the
elevation
configuration
and
composition
of
the
great
masses
of
terrestrial
surface
and
the
relative
extent
and
distribution
of
land
and
water
are
determined
by
geological
influences
equally
remote
from
our
jurisdiction
it
would
hence
seem
that
the
physical
adaptation
of
different
portions
of
the
earth
to
the
use
and
enjoyment
of
man
is
a
matter
so
strictly
belonging
to
mightier
than
human
powers
that
we
can
only
accept
geographical
nature
as
we
find
her
and
be
content
with
such
soils
and
such
skies
as
she
spontaneously
offers
influence
of
but
it
is
certain
that
man
has
done
much
to
mould
the
form
of
the
earth
surface
though
we
can
not
always
distinguish
between
the
results
of
his
action
and
the
effects
of
purely
geological
causes
that
the
destruction
of
the
forests
the
drainage
of
lakes
and
marshes
and
the
operations
of
rural
husbandry
and
industrial
art
have
tended
to
produce
great
changes
in
the
hygrometric
thermometric
electric
and
chemical
condition
of
the
atmosphere
though
we
are
not
yet
able
to
measure
the
force
of
the
different
elements
of
disturbance
or
to
say
how
far
they
have
been
compensated
by
each
other
or
by
still
obscurer
influences
and
finally
that
the
myriad
forms
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
which
covered
the
earth
when
man
first
entered
upon
the
theatre
of
a
nature
whose
harmonies
he
was
destined
to
derange
have
been
through
his
action
greatly
changed
in
numerical
proportion
sometimes
much
modified
in
form
and
product
and
sometimes
entirely
extirpated
the
physical
revolutions
thus
wrought
by
man
have
not
all
been
destructive
to
human
interests

no
nutritious
vegetable

which
once
brought
forth
but
the
fewest

suited
for
the
sustenance
and
comfort
of

their
climates
created
and
stimulated
the

the
most
imperious
urgency

physical
wants

the
most
rugged

made
in

to
yield
and
distribute
all
that
supplies
the
material
necessities
all
that
contributes
to
the
sensuous
enjoyments
and
conveniences
of
civilized
life
the
scythia
the
thule
the
britain
the
germany
and
the
gaul
which
the
roman
writers
describe
in
such
forbidding
terms
have
been
brought
almost
to
rival
the
native
luxuriance
and
easily
won
plenty
of
southern
italy
and
while
the
fountains
of
oil
and
wine
that
refreshed
old
greece
and
syria
and
northern
africa
have
almost
ceased
to
flow
and
the
soils
of
those
fair
lands
are
turned
to
thirsty
and
inhospitable
deserts
the
hyperborean
regions
of
europe
have
conquered
or
rather
compensated
the
rigors
of
climate
and
attained
to
a
material
wealth
and
variety
of
product
that
with
all
their
natural
advantages
the
granaries
of
the
ancient
world
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
enjoyed
these
changes
for
evil
and
for
good
have
not
been
caused
by
great
natural
revolutions
of
the
globe
nor
are
they
by
any
means
attributable
wholly
to
the
moral
and
physical
action
or
inaction
of
the
peoples
or
in
all
cases
even
of
the
races
that
now
inhabit
these
respective
regions
they
are
products
of
a
complication
of
conflicting
or
coincident
forces
acting
through
a
long
series
of
generations
here
improvidence
wastefulness
and
wanton
violence
there
foresight
and
wisely
guided
persevering
industry
so
far
as
they
are
purely
the
calculated
and
desired
results
of
those
simple
and
familiar
operations
of
agriculture
and
of
social
life
which
are
as
universal
as
civilization
the
removal
of
the
forests
which
covered
the
soil
required
for
the
cultivation
of
edible
fruits
the
drying
of
here
and
there
a
few
acres
too
moist
for
profitable
husbandry
by
draining
off
the
surface
waters
the
substitution
of
domesticated
and
nutritious
for
wild
and
unprofitable
vegetable
growths
the
construction
of
roads
and
canals
and
artificial
harbors
they
belong
to
the
sphere
of
rural
commercial
and
political
economy
more
properly
than
to
geography
and
hence
are
but
incidentally
embraced
within
the
range
of
our
present
inquiries
which
concern
physical
not
financial
balances
i
propose
to
examine
only
the
greater
more
permanent
and
more
comprehensive
mutations
which
man
has
produced
and
is
producing
in
earth
sea
and
sky
sometimes
indeed
with
conscious
purpose
but
for
the
most
part
as
unforeseen
though
natural
consequences
of
acts
performed
for
narrower
and
more
immediate
ends
the
exact
measurement
of
the
geographical
changes
hitherto
thus
effected
is
as
i
have
hinted
impracticable
and
we
possess
in
relation
to
them
the
means
of
only
qualitative
not
quantitative
analysis
the
fact
of
such
revolutions
is
established
partly
by
historical
evidence
partly
by
analogical
deduction
from
effects
produced
in
our
own
time
by
operations
similar
in
character
to
those
which
must
have
taken
place
in
more
or
less
remote
ages
of
human
action
both
sources
of
information
are
alike
defective
in
precision
the
latter
for
general
reasons
too
obvious
to
require
specification
the
former
because
the
facts
to
which
it
bears
testimony
occurred
before
the
habit
or
the
means
of
rigorously
scientific
observation
upon
any
branch
of
physical
research
and
especially
upon
climatic
changes
existed
of
our
meteorological
the
invention
of
measures
of
heat
and
of
atmospheric
moisture
pressure
and
precipitation
is
extremely
recent
hence
ancient
physicists
have
left
us
no
thermometric
or
barometric
records
no
tables
of
the
fall
evaporation
and
flow
of
waters
and
even
no
accurate
maps
of
coast
lines
and
the
course
of
rivers
their
notices
of
these
phenomena
are
almost
wholly
confined
to
excessive
and
exceptional
instances
of
high
or
of
low
temperatures
extraordinary
falls
of
rain
and
snow
and
unusual
floods
or
droughts
our
knowledge
of
the
meteorological
condition
of
the
earth
at
any
period
more
than
two
centuries
before
our
own
time
is
derived
from
these
imperfect
details
from
the
vague
statements
of
ancient
historians
and
geographers
in
regard
to
the
volume
of
rivers
and
the
relative
extent
of
forest
and
cultivated
land
from
the
indications
furnished
by
the
history
of
the
agriculture
and
rural
economy
of
past
generations
and
from
other
almost
purely
casual
sources
of
information
among
these
latter
we
must
rank
certain
newly
laid
open
fields
of
investigation
from
which
facts
bearing
on
the
point
now
under
consideration
have
been
gathered
i
allude
to
the
discovery
of
artificial
objects
in
geological
formations
older
than
any
hitherto
recognized
as
exhibiting
traces
of
the
existence
of
man
to
the
ancient
lacustrine
habitations
of
switzerland
containing
the
implements
of
the
occupants
remains
of
their
food
and
other
relics
of
human
life
to
the
curious
revelations
of
the
kjökkenmöddinger
or
heaps
of
kitchen
refuse
in
denmark
and
of
the
peat
mosses
in
the
same
and
other
northern
countries
to
the
dwellings
and
other
evidences
of
the
industry
of
man
in
remote
ages
sometimes
laid
bare
by
the
movement
of
sand
dunes
on
the
coasts
of
france
and
of
the
north
sea
and
to
the
facts
disclosed
on
the
shores
of
the
latter
by
excavations
in
inhabited
mounds
which
were
perhaps
raised
before
the
period
of
the
roman
empire
these
remains
are
memorials
of
races
which
have
left
no
written
records
because
they
perished
before
the
historical
period
of
the
countries
they
occupied
began
the
plants
and
animals
that
furnished
the
relics
found
in
the
deposits
were
certainly
contemporaneous
with
man
for
they
are
associated
with
his
works
and
have
evidently
served
his
uses
in
some
cases
the
animals
belonged
to
species
well
ascertained
to
be
now
altogether
extinct
in
some
others
both
the
animals
and
the
vegetables
though
extant
elsewhere

at

to

of

at
the

of
their

there
are
however
sources
of
error
which
have
not
always
been
sufficiently
guarded
against
in
making
these
estimates
when
a
boat
composed
of
several
pieces
of
wood
fastened
together
by
pins
of
the
same
material
is
dug
out
of
a
bog
it
is
inferred
that
the
vessel
and
the
skeletons
and
implements
found
with
it
belong
to
an
age
when
the
use
of
iron
was
not
known
to
the
builders
but
this
conclusion
is
not
warranted
by
the
simple
fact
that
metals
were
not
employed
in
its
construction
for
the
nubians

this
day

large
enough
to
carry
half
a
dozen
persons
across

out
of

of

wood
pinned

entirely
with
wooden
bolts
nor
is
the
occurrence
of
flint
arrow
heads
and
knives
in
conjunction
with
other
evidences
of
human
life
conclusive
proof
as
to
the
antiquity
of
the
latter
lyell
informs
us
that
some
oriental
tribes
still
continue
to
use
the
same
stone
implements
as
their
ancestors
after
that
mighty
empires
where
the
use
of
metals
in
the
arts
was
well
known
had
flourished
for
three
thousand
years
in
their
neighborhood
and
the
north
american
indians
now
manufacture
and
use
weapons
of
stone
and
even
of
glass
chipping
them
in
the
latter
case
out
of
the
bottoms
of
thick
bottles
with
great
facility
we
may
also
be
misled
by
our
ignorance
of
the
commercial
relations
existing
between
savage
tribes
extremely
rude
nations
in
spite
of
their
jealousies
and
their
perpetual
wars
sometimes
contrive
to
exchange
the
products
of
provinces
very
widely
separated
from
each
other
the
mounds
of
ohio
contain
pearls
thought
to
be
marine
which
must
have
come
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
or
perhaps
even
from
california
and
the
knives
and
pipes
found
in
the
same
graves
are
often
formed
of
material
that
was
naturally
paid
for
by
some
home
product
exported
to
the
locality
whence
the
material
was
derived
the
art
of
preserving
fish
flesh
and
fowl
by
drying
and
smoking
is
widely
diffused
and
of
great
antiquity
the
indians
of
long
island
sound
are
said
to
have
carried
on
a
trade
in
dried
shell
fish
with
tribes
residing
very
far
inland
from
the
earliest
ages
the
inhabitants
of
the
faroe
and
orkney
islands
and
of
the
opposite
mainland
coasts
have
smoked
wild
fowl
and
other
flesh
hence
it
is
possible
that
the
animal
and
the
vegetable
food
the
remains
of
which
are
found
in
the
ancient
deposits
i
am
speaking
of
may
sometimes
have
been
brought
from
climates
remote
from
that
where
it
was
consumed
the
most
important
as
well
as
the
most
trustworthy
conclusions
with
respect
to
the
climate
of
ancient
europe
and
asia
are
those
drawn
from
the
accounts
given
by
the
classical
writers
of
the
growth
of
cultivated
plants
but
these
are
by
no
means
free
from
uncertainty
because
we
can
seldom
be
sure
of
an
identity
of
species
almost
never
of
an
identity
of
race
or
variety
between
vegetables
known
to
the
agriculturists
of
greece
and
rome
and
those
of
modern
times
which
are
thought
most
nearly
to
resemble
them
besides
this
there
is
always
room
for
doubt
whether
the
habits
of
plants
long
grown
in
different
countries
may
not
have
been
so
changed
by
domestication
that
the
conditions
of
temperature
and
humidity
which
they
required
twenty
centuries
ago
were
different
from
those
at
present
demanded
for
their
advantageous
cultivation
even
if
we
suppose
an
identity
of
species
of
race
and
of
habit
to
be
established
between
a
given
ancient
and
modern
plant
the
negative
fact
that
the
latter
will
not
grow
now
where
it
flourished
two
thousand
years
ago
does
not
in
all
cases
prove
a
change
of
climate
the
same
result
might
follow
from
the
exhaustion
of
the
soil
or
from
a
change
in
the
quantity
of
moisture
it
habitually
contains
after
a
district
of
country
has
been
completely
or
even
partially
cleared
of
its
forest
growth
and
brought
under
cultivation
the
drying
of
the
soil
under
favorable
circumstances
goes
on
for
generations
perhaps
for
ages
in
other
cases
from
injudicious
husbandry
or
the
diversion
or
choking
up
of
natural
watercourses
it
may
become
more
highly
charged
with
humidity
an
increase
or
diminution
of
the
moisture
of
a
soil
almost
necessarily
supposes
an
elevation
or
a
depression
of
its
winter
or
its
summer
heat
and
of
its
extreme
if
not
of
its
mean
annual
temperature
though
such
elevation
or
depression
may
be
so
slight
as
not
sensibly
to
raise
or
lower
the
mercury
in
a
thermometer
exposed
to
the
open
air
any
of
these
causes
more
or
less
humidity
or
more
or
less
warmth
of
soil
would
affect
the
growth
both
of
wild
and
of
cultivated
vegetation
and
consequently
without
any
appreciable
change
in
atmospheric
temperature
precipitation
or
evaporation
plants
of
a
particular
species
might
cease
to
be
advantageously
cultivated
where
they
had
once
been
easily
reared
we
are
very
imperfectly
acquainted
with
the
present
mean
and
extreme
temperature
or
the
precipitation
and
the
evaporation
of
any
extensive
region
even
in
countries
most
densely
peopled
and
best
supplied
with
instruments
and
observers
the
progress
of
science
is
constantly
detecting
errors
of
method
in
older
observations
and
many
laboriously
constructed
tables
of
meteorological
phenomena
are
now
thrown
aside
as
fallacious
and
therefore
worse
than
useless
because
some
condition
necessary
to
secure
accuracy
of
result
was
neglected
in
obtaining
the
data
on
which
they
were
founded
to
take
a
familiar
instance
it
is
but
recently
that
attention
has
been
drawn
to
the
great
influence
of
slight
changes
of
station
upon
the
results
of
observations
of
temperature
and
precipitation
a
thermometer
removed
but
a
few
hundred
yards
from
its
first
position
differs
not
unfrequently
five
sometimes
even
ten
degrees
in
its
readings
and
when
we
are
told
that
the
annual
fall
of
rain
on
the
roof
of
the
observatory
at
paris
is
two
inches
less
than
on
the
ground
by
the
side
of
it
we
may
see
that
the
level
of
the
is
a
point
of
much
consequence
in
making
estimates
from
its
measurements
the
data
from
which
results
have
been
deduced
with
respect
to
the
hygrometrical
and
thermometrical
conditions
the
climate
in
short
of
different
countries
have
very
often
been
derived
from
observations
at
single
points
in
cities
or
districts
separated
by
considerable
distances
the
tendency
of
errors
and
accidents
to
balance
each
other
authorizes
us
indeed
to
entertain
greater
confidence
than
we
could
otherwise
feel
in
the
conclusions
drawn
from
such
tables
but
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
probable
that
they
would
be
much
modified
by
more
numerous
series
of
observations
at
different
stations
within
narrow
limits
there
is
one
branch
of
research
which
is
of
the
utmost
importance
in
reference
to
these
questions
but
which
from
the
great
difficulty
of
direct
observation
upon
it
has
been
less
successfully
studied
than
almost
any
other
problem
of
physical
science
i
refer
to
the
proportions
between
precipitation
superficial
drainage
absorption
and
evaporation
precise
actual
measurement
of
these
quantities
upon
even
a
single
acre
of
ground
is
impossible
and
in
all
cabinet
experiments
on
the
subject
the
conditions
of
the
surface
observed
are
so
different
from
those
which
occur
in
nature
that
we
can
not
safely
reason
from
one
case
to
the
other
in
nature
the
inclination
of
the
ground
the
degree
of
freedom
or
obstruction
of
the
surface
the
composition
and
density
of
the
soil
upon
which
its
permeability
by
water
and
its
power
of
absorbing
and
retaining
or
transmitting
moisture
depend
its
temperature
the
dryness
or
saturation
of
the
subsoil
vary
at
comparatively
short
distances
and
though
the
precipitation
upon
and
the
superficial
flow
from
very
small
geographical
basins
may
be
estimated
with
an
approach
to
precision
yet
even
here
we
have
no
present
means
of
knowing
how
much
of
the
water
absorbed
by
the
earth
is
restored
to
the
atmosphere
by
evaporation
and
how
much
carried
off
by
infiltration
or
other
modes
of
underground
discharge
when
therefore
we
attempt
to
use
the
phenomena
observed
on
a
few
square
or
cubic
yards
of
earth
as
a
basis
of
reasoning
upon
the
meteorology
of
a
province
it
is
evident
that
our
data
must
be
insufficient
to
warrant
positive
general
conclusions
in
discussing
the
climatology
of
whole
countries
or
even
of
comparatively
small
local
divisions
we
may
safely
say
that
none
can
tell
what
percentage
of
the
water
they
receive
from
the
atmosphere
is
evaporated
what
absorbed
by
the
ground
and
conveyed
off
by
subterranean
conduits
what
carried
down
to
the
sea
by
superficial
channels
what
drawn
from
the
earth
or
the
air
by
a
given
extent
of
forest
of
short
pasture
vegetation
or
of
tall
what
given
out
again
by
surfaces
so
covered
or
by
bare
ground
of
various
textures
and
composition
under
different
conditions
of
atmospheric
temperature
pressure
and
humidity
or
what
is
the
amount
of
evaporation
from
water
ice
or
snow
under
the
varying
exposures
to
which
in
actual
nature
they
are
constantly
subjected
if
then
we
are
so
ignorant
of
all
these
climatic
phenomena
in
the
regions
inhabited
by
man
it
is
evident
that
we
can
rely
little
upon
theoretical
deductions
applied
to
the
former
more
natural
state
of
the
same
regions
less
still
to
such
as
are
adopted
with
respect
to
distant

and
primitive
countries

by

on

in

the

effects
of
human
action
on
superficial
geography
we
are
treading
on
safer
ground
and
dealing
with
much
less
subtile
phenomena
less
intractable
elements
great
physical
changes
can
in
some
cases
be
positively
shown
in
some
almost
certainly
inferred
to
have
been
produced
by
the
operations
of
rural
industry
and
by
the
labors
of
man
in
other
spheres
of
material
effort
and
hence
in
this
most
important
part
of
our
subject
we
can
arrive
at
many
positive
generalizations
and
obtain
practical
results
of
no
small
economical
value
and
possibility
of
physical

circumstances

to
invest
with
great
present
interest
the
questions
how
far
man
can
permanently
modify
and
ameliorate
those
physical
conditions
of
terrestrial
surface
and
climate
on
which
his
material
welfare
depends
how
far
he
can
compensate
arrest
or
retard
the
deterioration
which
many
of
his
agricultural
and
industrial
processes
tend
to
produce
and
how
far
he
can
restore
fertility
and
salubrity
to
soils
which
his
follies
or
his
crimes
have
made
barren
or
pestilential
among
these
circumstances
the
most
prominent
perhaps
is
the
necessity
of
providing
new
homes
for
a
european
population
which
is
increasing
more
rapidly
than
its
means
of
subsistence
new
physical
comforts
for
classes
of
the
people
that
have
now
become
too
much
enlightened
and
have
imbibed
too
much
culture
to
submit
to
a
longer
deprivation
of
a
share
in
the
material
enjoyments
which
the
privileged
ranks
have
hitherto
monopolized
to
supply
new

there
are

the
vast
unoccupied

of

of

and
of
many
other
great
oceanic

the
sparsely
inhabited

still
unexhausted

finally
the

must
be
tasked
to

by
his

of

which
a
wise

would
have
made
plenteous
and
perennial
sources
of
beauty
health
and
wealth
in
those
yet
virgin
lands
which
the
progress
of
modern
discovery
in
both
hemispheres
has
brought
and
is
still
bringing
to
the
knowledge
and
control
of
civilized
man
not
much
improvement
of
great
physical
conditions

to
be
looked
for
the

indeed
to
be
considerably
reduced
superfluous
waters
to
be
drawn
off
and
routes
of
internal
communication
to
be
constructed
but
the
primitive
geographical
and
climatic
features
of
these
countries
ought
to
be
as
far
as
possible
retained
of

undisturbed

fashions
her
territory
as
to
give
it
almost
unchanging
permanence
of
form
outline
and
proportion
except
when
shattered
by
geologic
convulsions
and
in
these
comparatively
rare
cases
of
derangement
she
sets
herself
at
once
to
repair
the
superficial
damage
and
to
restore
as
nearly
as
practicable
the
former
aspect
of
her
dominion
in
new
countries
the
natural
inclination
of
the
ground
the
slopes
and
levels
are
generally
such
as
best
secure
the
stability
of
the
soil
they
have
been
graded
and
lowered
or
elevated
by
frost
and
chemical
forces
and
gravitation
and
the
flow
of
water
and
vegetable
deposit
and
the
action
of
the
winds
until
by
a
general
compensation
of
conflicting
forces
a
condition
of
equilibrium
has
been
reached
which
without
the
action
of
man
would
remain
with
little
fluctuation
for
countless
ages
we
need
not
go
far
back
to
reach
a
period
when
in
all
that
portion
of
the
north
american
continent
which
has
been
occupied
by
british
colonization
the
geographical
elements
very
nearly
balanced
and
compensated
each
other
at
the
commencement
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
soil
with
insignificant
exceptions
was
covered
with
forests
and
whenever
the
indian
in
consequence
of
war
or
the
exhaustion
of
the
beasts
of
the
chase
abandoned
the
narrow
fields
he
had
planted
and
the
woods
he
had
burned
over
they
speedily
returned
by
a
succession
of
herbaceous
arborescent
and
arboreal
growths
to
their
original
state
even
a
single
generation
sufficed
to
restore
them
almost
to
their
primitive
luxuriance
of
forest
vegetation
the
unbroken
forests
had
attained
to
their
maximum
density
and
strength
of
growth
and
as
the
older
trees
decayed
and
fell
they
were
succeeded
by
new
shoots
or
seedlings
so
that
from
century
to
century
no
perceptible
change
seems
to
have
occurred
in
the
wood
except
the
slow
spontaneous
succession
of
crops
this
succession
involved
no
interruption
of
growth
and
but
little
break
in
the
boundless
contiguity
of
shade
for
in
the
husbandry
of
nature
there
are
no
fallows
trees
fall
singly
not
by
square
roods
and
the
tall
pine
is
hardly
prostrate
before
the
light
and
heat
admitted
to
the
ground
by
the
removal
of
the
dense
crown
of
foliage
which
had
shut
them
out
stimulate
the
germination
of
the
seeds
of
trees
that
had
lain
waiting
this
kindly
influence
perhaps
for
centuries
two
natural
causes
destructive
in
character
were
indeed
in
operation
in
the
primitive
american
forests
though
in
the
northern
colonies
at
least
there
were
sufficient
compensations
for
we
do
not
discover
that
any
considerable
permanent
change
was
produced
by
them
i
refer
to
the
action
of
beavers
and
of
fallen
trees
in
producing
bogs
and
of
smaller
animals
insects
and
birds
in
destroying
the
woods
bogs
are
less
numerous
and
extensive
in
the
northern
states
of
the
american
union
because
the
natural
inclination
of
the
surface
favors
drainage
but
they
are
more
frequent
and
cover
more
ground
in
the
southern
states
for
the
opposite
reason
they
generally
originate
in
the
checking
of
watercourses
by
the
falling
of
timber
or
of
earth
and
rocks
across
their
channels
if
the
impediment
thus
created
is
sufficient
to
retain
a
permanent
accumulation
of
water
behind
it
the
trees
whose
roots
are
overflowed
soon
perish
and
then
by
their
fall
increase
the
obstruction
and
of
course
occasion
a
still
wider
spread
of
the
stagnating
stream
this
process
goes
on
until
the
water
finds
a
new
outlet
at
a
higher
level
not
liable
to
similar
interruption
the
fallen
trees
not
completely
covered
by
water
are
soon
overgrown
with
mosses
aquatic
and
plants
propagate
themselves
and
spread
until
they
more
or
less
completely
fill
up
the
space
occupied
by
the
water
and
the
surface
is
gradually
converted
from
a
pond
to
a
quaking
morass
the
morass
is
slowly
solidified
by
vegetable
production
and
deposit
then
very
often
restored
to
the
forest
condition
by
the
growth
of
black
ashes
cedars
or
in
southern
latitudes
cypresses
and
other
trees
suited
to
such
a
soil
and
thus
the
interrupted
harmony
of
nature
is
at
last
reëstablished
i
am
disposed
to
think
that
more
bogs
in
the
northern
states
owe
their
origin
to
beavers
than
to
accidental
obstructions
of
rivulets
by
or
naturally
decayed
trees
for
there
are
few
swamps
in
those
states
at
the
outlets
of
which
we
may
not
by
careful
search
find
the
remains
of
a
beaver
dam
the
beaver
sometimes
inhabits
natural
lakelets
but
he
prefers
to
owe
his
pond
to
his
own
ingenuity
and
toil
the
reservoir
once
constructed
its
inhabitants
rapidly
multiply
and
as
its
harvests
of
pond
lilies
and
other
aquatic
plants
on
which
this
quadruped
feeds
in
winter
become
too
small
for
the
growing
population
the
beaver
metropolis
sends
out
expeditions
of
discovery
and
colonization
the
pond
gradually
fills
up
by
the
operation
of
the
same
causes
as
when
it
owes
its
existence
to
an
accidental
obstruction
and
when
at
last
the
original
settlement
is
converted
into
a
bog
by
the
usual
processes
of
vegetable
life
the
remaining
inhabitants
abandon
it
and
build
on
some
virgin
brooklet
a
new
city
of
the
waters
in
countries
somewhat
further
advanced
in
civilization
than
those
occupied
by
the
north
american
indians
as
in
mediæval
ireland
the
formation
of
bogs
may
be
commenced
by
the
neglect
of
man
to
remove
from
the
natural
channels
of
superficial
drainage
the
tops
and
branches
of
trees
felled
for
the
various
purposes
to
which
wood
is
applicable
in
his
rude
industry
and
when
the
flow
of
the
water
is
thus
checked
nature
goes
on
with
the
processes
i
have
already
described
in
such
regions
too
windfalls
are
more
frequent
than
in
those
where
the
forest
is
unbroken
because
when
openings
have
been
made
in
it
for
agricultural
or
other
purposes
the
entrance
thus
afforded
to
the
wind
occasions
the
sudden
overthrow
of
hundreds
of
trees
which
might
otherwise
have
stood
for
generations
and
thus
have
fallen
to
the
ground
only
one
by
one
as
natural
decay
brought
them
down
besides
this
the
flocks
bred
by
man
in
the
pastoral
state
keep
down
the
incipient
growth
of
trees
on
the
bogs
and
prevent
them
from
recovering
their
primitive
condition
young
trees
in
the
native
forest
are
sometimes
girdled
and
killed
by
the
smaller
rodent
quadrupeds
and
their
growth
is
checked
by
birds
which
feed
on
the
terminal
bud
but
these
animals
as
we
shall
see
are
generally
found
on
the
skirts
of
the
wood
only
not
in
its
deeper
recesses
and
hence
the
mischief
they
do
is
not
extensive
the
insects
which
damage
primitive
forests
by
feeding
upon
products
of
trees
essential
to
their
growth
are
not
numerous
nor
is
their
appearance
in
destructive
numbers
frequent
and
those
which
perforate
the
stems
and
branches
to
deposit
and
hatch
their
eggs
more
commonly
select
dead
trees
for
that
purpose
though
unhappily
there
are
important
exceptions
to
this
latter
remark
i
do
not
know
that
we
have
any
evidence
of
the
destruction
or
serious
injury
of
american
forests
by
insects
before
or
even
soon
after
the
period
of
colonization
but
since
the
white
man
has
laid
bare
a
vast
proportion
of
the
earth
surface
and
thereby
produced
changes
favorable
perhaps
to
the
multiplication
of
these
pests
they
have
greatly
increased
in
numbers
and
apparently
in
voracity
also
not
many
years
ago
the
pines
on
thousands
of
acres
of
land
in
north
carolina
were
destroyed
by
insects
not
known
to
have
ever
done
serious
injury
to
that
tree
before
in
such
cases
as
this
and
others
of
the
like
sort
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
man
is
the
indirect
cause
of
an
evil
for
which
he
pays
so
heavy
a
penalty
insects
increase
whenever
the
birds
which
feed
upon
them
disappear
hence
in
the
wanton
destruction
of
the
robin
and
other
insectivorous
birds
the
the
featherless
biped
man
is
not
only
exchanging
the
vocal
orchestra
which
greets
the
rising
sun
for
the
drowsy
evening
drone
and
depriving
his
groves
and
his
fields
of
their
fairest
ornament
but
he
is
waging
a
treacherous
warfare
on
his
natural
allies
in
fine
in
countries
untrodden
by
man
the
proportions
and
relative
positions
of
land
and
water
the
atmospheric
precipitation
and
evaporation
the
thermometric
mean
and
the
distribution
of
vegetable
and
animal
life
are
subject
to
change
only
from
geological
influences
so
slow
in
their
operation
that
the
geographical
conditions
may
be
regarded
as
constant
and
immutable
these
arrangements
of
nature
it
is
in
most
cases
highly
desirable
substantially
to
maintain
when
such
regions
become
the
seat
of
organized
commonwealths
it
is
therefore
a
matter
of
the
first
importance
that
in
commencing
the
process
of
fitting
them
for
permanent
civilized
occupation
the
transforming
operations
should
be
so
conducted
as
not
unnecessarily
to
derange
and
destroy
what
in
too
many
cases
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
man
to
rectify
or
restore
of
disturbed
in
reclaiming
and
reoccupying
lands
laid
waste
by
human
improvidence
or
malice
and
abandoned
by
man
or
occupied
only
by
a
nomade
or
thinly
scattered
population
the
task
of
the
pioneer
settler
is
of
a
very
different
character
he
is
to
become
a
with
nature
in
the
reconstruction
of
the
damaged
fabric
which
the
negligence
or
the
wantonness
of
former
lodgers
has
rendered
untenantable
he
must
aid
her
in
reclothing
the
mountain
slopes
with
forests
and
vegetable
mould
thereby
restoring
the
fountains
which
she
provided
to
water
them
in
checking
the
devastating
fury
of
torrents
and
bringing
back
the
surface
drainage
to
its
primitive
narrow
channels
and
in
drying
deadly
morasses
by
opening
the
natural
sluices
which
have
been
choked
up
and
cutting
new
canals
for
drawing
off
their
stagnant
waters
he
must
thus
on
the
one
hand
create
new
reservoirs
and
on
the
other
remove
mischievous
accumulations
of
moisture
thereby
equalizing
and
regulating
the
sources
of
atmospheric
humidity
and
of
flowing
water
both
which
are
so
essential
to
all
vegetable
growth
and
of
course
to
human
and
lower
animal
life
of
man
has
too
long
forgotten
that
the
earth
was
given
to
him
for
usufruct
alone
not
for
consumption
still
less
for
profligate
waste
nature
has
provided
against
the
absolute
destruction
of
any
of
her
elementary
matter
the
raw
material
of
her
works
the
thunderbolt
and
the
tornado
the
most
convulsive
throes
of
even
the
volcano
and
the
earthquake
being
only
phenomena
of
decomposition
and
recomposition
but
she
has
left
it
within
the
power
of
man
irreparably
to
derange
the
combinations
of
inorganic
matter
and
of
organic
life
which
through
the
night
of
æons
she
had
been
proportioning
and
balancing
to
prepare
the
earth
for
his
habitation
when
in
the
fulness
of
time
his
creator
should
call
him
forth
to
enter
into
its
possession
apart
from
the
hostile
influence
of
man
the
organic
and
the
inorganic
world
are
as
i
have
remarked
bound
together
by
such
mutual
relations
and
adaptations
as
secure
if
not
the
absolute
permanence
and
equilibrium
of
both
a
long
continuance
of
the
established
conditions
of
each
at
any
given
time
and
place
or
at
least
a
very
slow
and
gradual
succession
of
changes
in
those
conditions
but
man
is
everywhere
a
disturbing
agent
wherever
he
plants
his
foot
the
harmonies
of
nature
are
turned
to
discords
the
proportions
and
accommodations
which
insured
the
stability
of
existing
arrangements
are
overthrown
indigenous
vegetable
and
animal
species
are
extirpated
and
supplanted
by
others
of
foreign
origin
spontaneous
production
is
forbidden
or
restricted
and
the
face
of
the
earth
is
either
laid
bare
or
covered
with
a
new
and
reluctant
growth
of
vegetable
forms
and
with
alien
tribes
of
animal
life
these
intentional
changes
and
substitutions
constitute
indeed
great
revolutions
but
vast
as
is
their
magnitude
and
importance
they
are
as
we
shall
see
insignificant
in
comparison
with
the
contingent
and
unsought
results
which
have
flowed
from
them
the
fact
that
of
all
organic
beings
man
alone
is
to
be
regarded
as
essentially
a
destructive
power
and
that
he
wields
energies
to
resist
which
nature
that
nature
whom
all
material
life
and
all
inorganic
substance
obey
is
wholly
impotent
tends
to
prove
that
though
living
in
physical
nature
he
is
not
of
her
that
he
is
of
more
exalted
parentage
and
belongs
to
a
higher
order
of
existences
than
those
born
of
her
womb
and
submissive
to
her
dictates
there
are
indeed
brute
destroyers
beasts
and
birds
and
insects
of
prey
all
animal
life
feeds
upon
and
of
course
destroys
other
life
but
this
destruction
is
balanced
by
compensations
it
is
in
fact
the
very
means
by
which
the
existence
of
one
tribe
of
animals
or
of
vegetables
is
secured
against
being
smothered
by
the
encroachments
of
another
and
the
reproductive
powers
of
species
which
serve
as
the
food
of
others
are
always
proportioned
to
the
demand
they
are
destined
to
supply
man
pursues
his
victims
with
reckless
destructiveness
and
while
the
sacrifice
of
life
by
the
lower
animals
is
limited
by
the
cravings
of
appetite
he
unsparingly
persecutes
even
to
extirpation
thousands
of
organic
forms
which
he
can
not
consume
the
earth
was
not
in
its
natural
condition
completely
adapted
to
the
use
of
man
but
only
to
the
sustenance
of
wild
animals
and
wild
vegetation
these
live
multiply
their
kind
in
just
proportion
and
attain
their
perfect
measure
of
strength
and
beauty
without
producing
or
requiring
any
change
in
the
natural
arrangements
of
surface
or
in
each
other
spontaneous
tendencies
except
such
mutual
repression
of
excessive
increase
as
may
prevent
the
extirpation
of
one
species
by
the
encroachments
of
another
in
short
without
man
lower
animal
and
spontaneous
vegetable
life
would
have
been
constant
in
type
distribution
and
proportion
and
the
physical
geography
of
the
earth
would
have
remained
undisturbed
for
indefinite
periods
and
been
subject
to
revolution
only
from
possible
unknown
cosmical
causes
or
from
geological
action
but
man
the
domestic
animals
that
serve
him
the
field
and
garden
plants
the
products
of
which
supply
him
with
food
and
clothing
can
not
subsist
and
rise
to
the
full
development
of
their
higher
properties
unless
brute
and
unconscious
nature
be
effectually
combated
and
in
a
great
degree
vanquished
by
human
art
hence
a
certain
measure
of
transformation
of
terrestrial
surface
of
suppression
of
natural
and
stimulation
of
artificially
modified
productivity
becomes
necessary
this
measure
man
has
unfortunately
exceeded
he
has
felled
the
forests
whose
network
of
fibrous
roots
bound
the
mould
to
the
rocky
skeleton
of
the
earth
but
had
he
allowed
here
and
there
a
belt
of
woodland
to
reproduce
itself
by
spontaneous
propagation
most
of
the
mischiefs
which
his
reckless
destruction
of
the
natural
protection
of
the
soil
has
occasioned
would
have
been
averted
he
has
broken
up
the
mountain
reservoirs
the
percolation
of
whose
waters
through
unseen
channels
supplied
the
fountains
that
refreshed
his
cattle
and
fertilized
his
fields
but
he
has
neglected
to
maintain
the
cisterns
and
the
canals
of
irrigation
which
a
wise
antiquity
had
constructed
to
neutralize
the
consequences
of
its
own
imprudence
while
he
has
torn
the
thin
glebe
which
confined
the
light
earth
of
extensive
plains
and
has
destroyed
the
fringe
of
plants
which
skirted
the
coast
and
checked
the
drifting
of
the
sea
sand
he
has
failed
to
prevent
the
spreading
of
the
dunes
by
clothing
them
with
artificially
propagated
vegetation
he
has
ruthlessly
warred
on
all
the
tribes
of
animated
nature
whose
spoil
he
could
convert
to
his
own
uses
and
he
has
not
protected
the
birds
which
prey
on
the
insects
most
destructive
to
his
own
harvests
purely
untutored
humanity
it
is
true
interferes
comparatively
little
with
the
arrangements
of
nature
and
the
destructive
agency
of
man
becomes
more
and
more
energetic
and
unsparing
as
he
advances
in
civilization
until
the
impoverishment
with
which
his
exhaustion
of
the
natural
resources
of
the
soil
is
threatening
him
at
last
awakens
him
to
the
necessity
of
preserving
what
is
left
if
not
of
restoring
what
has
been
wantonly
wasted
the
wandering
savage
grows
no
cultivated
vegetable
fells
no
forest
and
extirpates
no
useful
plant
no
noxious
weed
if
his
skill
in
the
chase
enables
him
to
entrap
numbers
of
the
animals
on
which
he
feeds
he
compensates
this
loss
by
destroying
also
the
lion
the
tiger
the
wolf
the
otter
the
seal
and
the
eagle
thus
indirectly
protecting
the
feebler
quadrupeds
and
fish
and
fowls
which
would
otherwise
become
the
booty
of
beasts
and
birds
of
prey
but
with
stationary
life
or
rather
with
the
pastoral
state
man
at
once
commences
an
almost
indiscriminate
warfare
upon
all
the
forms
of
animal
and
vegetable
existence
around
him
and
as
he
advances
in
civilization
he
gradually
eradicates
or
transforms
every
spontaneous
product
of
the
soil
he
occupies
and
brute
action
it
has
been
maintained
by
authorities
as
high
as
any
known
to
modern
science
that
the
action
of
man
upon
nature
though
greater
in
does
not
differ
in
from
that
of
wild
animals
it
appears
to
me
to
differ
in
essential
character
because
though
it
is
often
followed
by
unforeseen
and
undesired
results
yet
it
is
nevertheless
guided
by
a
and
intelligent
will
aiming
as
often
at
secondary
and
remote
as
at
immediate
objects
the
wild
animal
on
the
other
hand
acts
instinctively
and
so
far
as
we
are
able
to
perceive
always
with
a
view
to
single
and
direct
purposes
the
backwoodsman
and
the
beaver
alike
fell
trees
the
man
that
he
may
convert
the
forest
into
an
olive
grove
that
will
mature
its
fruit
only
for
a
succeeding
generation
the
beaver
that
he
may
feed
upon
their
bark
or
use
them
in
the
construction
of
his
habitation
human
differs
from
brute
action
too
in
its
influence
upon
the
material
world
because
it
is
not
controlled
by
natural
compensations
and
balances
natural
arrangements
once
disturbed
by
man
are
not
restored
until
he
retires
from
the
field
and
leaves
free
scope
to
spontaneous
recuperative
energies
the
wounds
he
inflicts
upon
the
material
creation
are
not
healed
until
he
withdraws
the
arm
that
gave
the
blow
on
the
other
hand
i
am
not
aware
of
any
evidence
that
wild
animals
have
ever
destroyed
the
smallest
forest
extirpated
any
organic
species
or
modified
its
natural
character
occasioned
any
permanent
change
of
terrestrial
surface
or
produced
any
disturbance
of
physical
conditions
which
nature
has
not
of
herself
repaired
without
the
expulsion
of
the
animal
that
had
caused
it
the
form
of
geographical
surface
and
very
probably
the
climate
of
a
given
country
depend
much
on
the
character
of
the
vegetable
life
belonging
to
it
man
has
by
domestication
greatly
changed
the
habits
and
properties
of
the
plants
he
rears
he
has
by
voluntary
selection
immensely
modified
the
forms
and
qualities
of
the
animated
creatures
that
serve
him
and
he
has
at
the
same
time
completely
rooted
out
many
forms
of
animal
if
not
of
vegetable
being
what
is
there
in
the
influence
of
brute
life
that
corresponds
to
this
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
in
that
portion
of
the
american
continent
which
though
peopled
by
many
tribes
of
quadruped
and
fowl
remained
uninhabited
by
man
or
only
thinly
occupied
by
purely
savage
tribes
any
sensible
geographical
change
had
occurred
within
twenty
centuries
before
the
epoch
of
discovery
and
colonization
while
during
the
same
period
man
had
changed
millions
of
square
miles
in
the
fairest
and
most
fertile
regions
of
the
old
world
into
the
barrenest
deserts
the
ravages
committed
by
man
subvert
the
relations
and
destroy
the
balance
which
nature
had
established
between
her
organized
and
her
inorganic
creations
and
she
avenges
herself
upon
the
intruder
by
letting
loose
upon
her
defaced
provinces
destructive
energies
hitherto
kept
in
check
by
organic
forces
destined
to
be
his
best
auxiliaries
but
which
he
has
unwisely
dispersed
and
driven
from
the
field
of
action
when

there

and
even
of
alpine

where
the
operation
of
causes
set

action
by

has
brought
the
face
of
the

to
a
desolation
almost
as
complete
as
that
of
the

though
within
that
brief

which
we
call
the

they
are

to
have
been
covered
with

they

deteriorated

or

of
which

over

we
have
no

the
earth
is
fast
becoming
an
unfit
home
for
its

inhabitant
and
another
era
of
equal
human
crime
and
human
improvidence
and
of
like
duration
with
that
through
which

of

that

extend
would
reduce
it
to
such
a
condition
of
impoverished
productiveness
of
shattered

of
climatic
excess
as
to
threaten
the
depravation
barbarism
and
perhaps
even
extinction
of
the
species
true
there
is
a
partial
reverse
to
this
picture
on
narrow
theatres
new
forests
have
been
planted
inundations
of
flowing
streams
restrained
by
heavy
walls
of
masonry
and
other
constructions
torrents
compelled
to
aid
by
depositing
the
slime
with
which
they
are
charged
in
filling
up
lowlands
and
raising
the
level
of
morasses
which
their
own
overflows
had
created
ground
submerged
by
the
encroachments
of
the
ocean
or
exposed
to
be
covered
by
its
tides
has
been
rescued
from
its
dominion
by
diking
swamps
and
even
lakes
have
been
drained
and
their

brought
within
the
domain
of
agricultural
industry
drifting
coast
dunes
have
been
checked
and
made

by

seas
and
inland
waters
have
been
repeopled
with

and
even
the

of
the
sahara
have
been
fertilized
by
artesian
fountains
these
achievements
are
more
glorious
than
the
proudest
triumphs
of
war
but
thus
far
they
give
but
faint
hope
that
we
shall
yet
make
full
atonement
for
our
spendthrift
waste
of
the
bounties
of
nature
it
is
on
the
one
hand
rash
and
unphilosophical
to
attempt
to
set
limits
to
the
ultimate
power
of
man
over
inorganic
nature
and
it
is
unprofitable
on
the
other
to
speculate
on
what
may
be
accomplished
by
the
discovery
of
now
unknown
and
unimagined
natural
forces
or
even
by
the
invention
of
new
arts
and
new
processes
but
since
we
have
seen
aerostation
the
motive
power
of
elastic
vapors
the
wonders
of
modern
telegraphy
the
destructive
explosiveness
of
gunpowder
and
even
of
a
substance
so
harmless
unresisting
and
inert
as
cotton
nothing
in
the
way
of
mechanical
achievement
seems
impossible
and
it
is
hard
to
restrain
the
imagination
from
wandering
forward
a
couple
of
generations
to
an
epoch
when
our
descendants
shall
have
advanced
as
far
beyond
us
in
physical
conquest
as
we
have
marched
beyond
the
trophies
erected
by
our
grandfathers
i
must
therefore
be
understood
to
mean
only
that
no
agencies
now
known
to
man
and
directed
by
him
seem
adequate
to
the
reducing
of
great
alpine
precipices
to
such
slopes
as
would
enable
them
to
support
a
vegetable
clothing
or
to
the
covering
of
large
extents
of
denuded
rock
with
earth
and
planting
upon
them
a
forest
growth
but
among
the
mysteries
which
science
is
yet
to
reveal
there
may
be
still
undiscovered
methods
of
accomplishing
even
grander
wonders
than
these
mechanical
philosophers
have
suggested
the
possibility
of
accumulating
and
treasuring
up
for
human
use
some
of
the
greater
natural
forces
which
the
action
of
the
elements
puts
forth
with
such
astonishing
energy
could
we
gather
and
bind
and
make
subservient
to
our
control
the
power
which
a
west
indian
hurricane
exerts
through
a
small
area
in
one
continuous
blast
or
the
momentum
expended
by
the
waves
in
a
tempestuous
winter
upon
the
breakwater
at
cherbourg
or
the
lifting
power
of
the
tide
for
a
month
at
the
head
of
the
bay
of
fundy
or
the
pressure
of
a
square
mile
of
sea
water
at
the
depth
of
five
thousand
fathoms
or
a
moment
of
the
might
of
an
earthquake
or
a
volcano
our
age
which
moves
no
mountains
and
casts
them
into
the
sea
by
faith
alone
might
hope
to
scarp
the
rugged
walls
of
the
alps
and
pyrenees
and
mount
taurus
robe
them
once
more
in
a
vegetation
as
rich
as
that
of
their
pristine
woods
and
turn
their
wasting
torrents
into
refreshing
streams
could
this
old
world
which
man
has
overthrown
be
rebuilded
could
human
cunning
rescue
its
wasted
hillsides
and
its
deserted
plains
from
solitude
or
mere
nomade
occupation
from
barrenness
from
nakedness
and
from
insalubrity
and
restore
the
ancient
fertility
and
healthfulness
of
the
etruscan
sea
coast
the

and
the
pontine

of
calabria
of

of

of

of
the

of

of

of
the

desert
of
mesopotamia
and
the
delta
of
the
euphrates
of
the
cyrenaica
of
africa
proper
numidia
and
mauritania
the
thronging
millions
of
europe
might
still
find
room
on
the
eastern
continent
and
the
main
current
of
emigration
be
turned
toward
the
rising
instead
of
the
setting
sun
but
changes
like
these
must
await
great
political
and
moral
revolutions
in
the
governments
and
peoples
by
whom
those
regions
are
now
possessed
a
command
of
pecuniary
and
of
mechanical
means
not
at
present
enjoyed
by
those
nations
and
a
more
advanced
and
generally
diffused
knowledge
of
the
processes
by
which
the
amelioration
of
soil
and
climate
is
possible
than
now
anywhere
exists
until
such
circumstances
shall
conspire
to
favor
the
work
of
geographical
regeneration
the
countries
i
have
mentioned
with
here
and
there
a
local
exception
will
continue
to
sink
into
yet
deeper
desolation
and
in
the
mean
time
the
american
continent
southern
africa
australia
and
the
smaller
oceanic
islands
will
be
almost
the
only
theatres
where
man
is
engaged
on
a
great
scale
in
transforming
the
face
of
nature
of
physical
decay
of
new
comparatively
short
as
is
the
period
through
which
the
colonization
of
foreign
lands
by
european
emigrants
extends
great
and
it
is
to
be
feared
sometimes
irreparable
injury
has
been
already
done
in
the
various
processes
by
which
man
seeks
to
subjugate
the
virgin
earth
and
many
provinces
first
trodden
by
the
sapiens
within
the
last
two
centuries
begin
to
show
signs
of
that
melancholy
dilapidation
which
is
now
driving
so
many
of
the
peasantry
of
europe
from
their
native
hearths
it
is
evidently
a
matter
of
great
moment
not
only
to
the
population
of
the
states
where
these
symptoms
are
manifesting
themselves
but
to
the
general
interests
of
humanity
that
this
decay
should
be
arrested
and
that
the
future
operations
of
rural
husbandry
and
of
forest
industry
in
districts
yet
remaining
substantially
in
their
native
condition
should
be
so
conducted
as
to
prevent
the
widespread
mischiefs
which
have
been
elsewhere
produced
by
thoughtless
or
wanton
destruction
of
the
natural
safeguards
of
the
soil
this
can
be
done
only
by
the
diffusion
of
knowledge
on
this
subject
among
the
classes
that
in
earlier
days
subdued
and
tilled
ground
in
which
they
had
no
vested
rights
but
who
in
our
time
own
their
woods
their
pastures
and
their
ploughlands
as
a
perpetual
possession
for
them
and
theirs
and
have
therefore
a
strong
interest
in
the
protection
of
their
domain
against
deterioration
and
formations
most
liable
to
physical
the
character
and
extent
of
the
evils
under
consideration
depend
very
much
on
climate
and
the
natural
forms
and
constitution
of
surface
if
the
precipitation
whether
great
or
small
in
amount
be
equally
distributed
through
the
seasons
so
that
there
are
neither
torrential
rains
nor
parching
droughts
and
if
further
the
general
inclination
of
ground
be
moderate
so
that
the
superficial
waters
are
carried
off
without
destructive
rapidity
of
flow
and
without
sudden
accumulation
in
the
channels
of
natural
drainage
there
is
little
danger
of
the
degradation
of
the
soil
in
consequence
of
the
removal
of
forest
or
other
vegetable
covering
and
the
natural
face
of
the
earth
may
be
considered
as
substantially
permanent
these
conditions
are
well
exemplified
in
ireland
in
a
great
part
of
england
in
extensive
districts
in
germany
and
france
and
fortunately
in
an
immense
proportion
of
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
and
the
basin
of
the
great
american
lakes
as
well
as
in
many
parts
of
the
continents
of
south
america
and
of
africa
destructive
changes
are
most
frequent
in
countries
of
irregular
and
mountainous
surface
and
in
climates
where
the
precipitation
is
confined
chiefly
to
a
single
season
and
where
the
year
is
divided
into
a
wet
and
a
dry
period
as
is
the
case
throughout
a
great
part
of
the
ottoman
empire
and
more
or
less
strictly
the
whole
mediterranean
basin
it
is
partly
though
by
no
means
entirely
owing
to
topographical
and
climatic
causes
that
the
blight
which
has
smitten
the
fairest
and
most
fertile
provinces
of
imperial
rome
has
spared
britannia
germania
pannonia
and
m
oe
sia
the
comparatively
inhospitable
homes
of
barbarous
races
who
in
the
days
of
the
cæsars
were
too
little
advanced
in
civilized
life
to
possess
either
the
power
or
the
will
to
wage
that
war
against
the
order
of
nature
which
seems
hitherto
an
almost
inseparable
condition
precedent
of
high
social
culture
and
of
great
progress
in
fine
and
mechanical
art
in
mountainous
countries
on
the
other
hand
various
causes
combine
to
expose
the
soil
to
constant
dangers
the
rain
and
snow
usually
fall
in
greater
quantity
and
with
much
inequality
of
distribution
the
snow
on
the
summits
accumulates
for
many
months
in
succession
and
then
is
not
unfrequently
almost
wholly
dissolved
in
a
single
thaw
so
that
the
entire
precipitation
of
months
is
in
a
few
hours
hurried
down
the
flanks
of
the
mountains
and
through
the
ravines
that
furrow
them
the
natural
inclination
of
the
surface
promotes
the
swiftness
of
the
gathering
currents
of
diluvial
rain
and
of
melting
snow
which
soon
acquire
an
almost
irresistible
force
and
power
of
removal
and
transportation
the
soil
itself
is
less
compact
and
tenacious
than
that
of
the
plains
and
if
the
sheltering
forest
has
been
destroyed
it
is
confined
by
few
of
the
threads
and
ligaments
by
which
nature
had
bound
it
together
and
attached
it
to
the
rocky
groundwork
hence
every
considerable
shower
lays
bare
its
roods
of
rock
and
the
torrents
sent
down
by
the
thaws
of
spring
and
by
occasional
heavy
discharges
of
the
summer
and
autumnal
rains
are
seas
of
mud
and
rolling
stones
that
sometimes
lay
waste
and
bury
beneath
them
acres
and
even
miles
of
pasture
and
field
and
vineyard
decay

i
have
remarked
that
the
effects
of
human
action
on
the
forms
of
the
earth
surface
could
not
always
be
distinguished
from
those
resulting
from
geological
causes
and
there
is
also
much
uncertainty
in
respect
to
the
precise
influence
of
the
clearing
and
cultivating
of
the
ground
and
of
other
rural
operations
upon
climate
it
is
disputed
whether
either
the
mean
or
the
extremes
of
temperature
the
periods
of
the
seasons
or
the
amount
or
distribution
of
precipitation
and
of
evaporation
in
any
country
whose
annals
are
known
have
undergone
any
change
during
the
historical
period
it
is
indeed
impossible
to
doubt
that
many
of
the
operations
of
the
pioneer
settler
tend
to
produce
great
modifications
in
atmospheric
humidity
temperature
and
electricity
but
we
are
at
present
unable
to
determine
how
far
one
set
of
effects
is
neutralized
by
another
or
compensated
by
unknown
agencies
this
question
scientific
research
is
inadequate
to
solve
for
want
of
the
necessary
data
but
well
conducted
observation
in
regions
now
first
brought
under
the
occupation
of
man
combined
with
such
historical
evidence
as
still
exists
may
be
expected
at
no
distant
period
to
throw
much
light
on
this
subject
australia
is
perhaps
the
country
from
which
we
have
a
right
to
expect
the
fullest
elucidation
of
these
difficult
and
disputable
problems
its
colonization
did
not
commence
until
the
physical
sciences
had
become
matter
of
almost
universal
attention
and
is
indeed
so
recent
that
the
memory
of
living
men
embraces
the
principal
epochs
of
its
history
the
peculiarities
of
its
fauna
its
flora
and
its
geology
are
such
as
to
have
excited
for
it
the
liveliest
interest
of
the
votaries
of
natural
science
its
mines
have
given
its
people
the
necessary
wealth
for
procuring
the
means
of
instrumental
observation
and
the
leisure
required
for
the
pursuit
of
scientific
research
and
large
tracts
of
virgin
forest
and
natural
meadow
are
rapidly
passing
under
the
control
of
civilized
man
here
then
exist
greater
facilities
and
stronger
motives
for
the
careful
study
of
the
topics
in
question
than
have
ever
been
found
combined
in
any
other
theatre
of
european
colonization
in
north
america
the
change
from
the
natural
to
the
artificial
condition
of
terrestrial
surface
began
about
the
period
when
the
most
important
instruments
of
meteorological
observation
were
invented
the
first
settlers
in
the
territory
now
constituting
the
united
states
and
the
british
american
provinces
had
other
things
to
do
than
to
tabulate
barometrical
and
thermometrical
readings
but
there
remain
some
interesting
physical
records
from
the
early
days
of
the
colonies
and
there
is
still
an
immense
extent
of
north
american
soil
where
the
industry
and
the
folly
of
man
have
as
yet
produced
little
appreciable
change
here
too
with
the
present
increased
facilities
for
scientific
observation
the
future
effects
direct
and
contingent
of
man
labors
can
be
measured
and
such
precautions
taken
in
those
rural
processes
which
we
call
improvements
as
to
mitigate
evils
perhaps
in
some
degree
inseparable
from
every
attempt
to
control
the
action
of
natural
laws
in
order
to
arrive
at
safe
conclusions
we
must
first
obtain
a
more
exact
knowledge
of
the
topography
and
of
the
present
superficial
and
climatic
condition
of
countries
where
the
natural
surface
is
as
yet
more
or
less
unbroken
this
can
only
be
accomplished
by
accurate
surveys
and
by
a
great
multiplication
of
the
points
of
meteorological
registry
already
so
numerous
and
as
moreover
considerable
changes
in
the
proportion
of
forest
and
of
cultivated
land
or
of
dry
and
wholly
or
partially
submerged
surface
will
often
take
place
within
brief
periods
it
is
highly
desirable
that
the
attention
of
observers
in
whose
neighborhood
the
clearing
of
the
soil
or
the
drainage
of
lakes
and
swamps
or
other
great
works
of
rural
improvement
are
going
on
or
meditated
should
be
especially
drawn
not
only
to
revolutions
in
atmospheric
temperature
and
precipitation
but
to
the
more
easily
ascertained
and
perhaps
more
important
local
changes
produced
by
these
operations
in
the
temperature
and
the
hygrometric
state
of
the
superficial
strata
of
the
earth
and
in
its
spontaneous
vegetable
and
animal
products
the
rapid
extension
of
railroads
which
now
everywhere
keeps
pace
with
and
sometimes
even
precedes
the
occupation
of
new
soil
for
agricultural
purposes
furnishes
great
facilities
for
enlarging
our
knowledge
of
the
topography
of
the
territory
they
traverse
because
their
cuttings
reveal
the
composition
and
general
structure
of
surface
and
the
inclination
and
elevation
of
their
lines
constitute
known
hypsometrical
sections
which
give
numerous
points
of
departure
for
the
measurement
of
higher
and
lower
stations
and
of
course
for
determining
the
relief
and
depression
of
surface
the
slope
of
the
beds
of
watercourses
and
many
other
not
less

so
important
an
element

is
this
that
it
has
been
seriously
questioned
whether
upon

does
not

much
to

as
the

has
transported

from

to

he
has
introduced
a

force
to
act
upon

not

to

and
thus
raise

by
an
annual

of

they
are

transported
to
greater
or

after
they
have

their

they
enter
on

on

they
grew

of

and
of
many
other
cultivated
plants
however
usually
remain
and
decay
in
the
earth
and
contribute
to
raise
its
surface
though
certainly
not
in
the
same
degree
as
the
forest
the
vegetables
which
have
taken
the
place
of
trees
unquestionably
perform
many
of
the
same
functions
they
radiate
heat
they
condense
the
humidity
of
the

they
act
upon
the
chemical
constitution
of

penetrate

to

depths
than
is
commonly
supposed
and
form
an
inextricable
labyrinth
of
filaments
which
bind
the
soil
together
and
prevent
its
erosion
by

the
annuals
and
perennials
too
shade
the

and
prevent
the
evaporation
of
moisture
from
its
surface
by
wind

sun
at
a
certain
stage
of
growth
grass
land
is
probably
a
more
energetic
radiator
and
condenser
than
even
the
forest
but
this
powerful
action
is
exerted
in
its
full
intensity
for
a
few
days
only
while
trees
continue
such
functions
with
unabated
vigor
for
many
months
in
succession
upon
the
whole
it
seems
quite
certain
that
no
cultivated
ground
is
as
efficient
in
tempering
climatic
extremes
or
in
conservation
of
geographical
surface
and
outline
as
is
the
soil
which
nature
herself
has
planted
of

it
belongs
to
vegetable
and

geography
which
are
almost
sciences
of
themselves
to
point
out
in
detail
what
man
has
done
to
change
the
distribution
of
plants
and
of
animated
life
and
to
revolutionize
the
aspect
of
organic
nature
but
some
of
the
more
important
facts
bearing
on
this
subject
may
pertinently
be
introduced
here
most
of
the
fruit
trees
grown
in
europe
and
the
united
states
are
believed
and
if
the
testimony
of
pliny
and
other
ancient
naturalists
is
to
be
depended
upon
many
of
them
are
historically
known
to
have
originated
in
the
temperate
climates
of
asia
the
wine
grape
has
been
thought
to
be
truly
indigenous
only
in
the
regions
bordering
on
the
eastern
end
of
the
black
sea
where
it
now
particularly
on
the
banks
of
the
rion
the
ancient
phasis
propagates
itself
spontaneously
and
grows
with
unexampled
luxuriance
but
some
species
of
the
vine
seem
native
to
europe
and
many
varieties
of
grape
have
been
too
long
known
as
common
to
every
part
of
the
united
states
to
admit
of
the
supposition
that
they
were
all
introduced
by
european
colonists
it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
the
commerce
or
at
least
the
maritime
carrying
trade
and
the
agricultural
and
mechanical
industry
of
the
world
are
in
very
large
proportion
dependent
on
vegetable
and
animal
products
little
or
not
at
all
known
to
ancient
greek
roman
and
jewish
civilization
in
many
instances
the
chief
supply
of
these
articles
comes
from
countries
to
which
they
are
probably
indigenous
and
where
they
are
still
almost
exclusively
grown
but
in
many
others
the
plants
or
animals
from
which
they
are
derived
have
been
introduced
by
man
into
the
regions
now
remarkable
for
their
most
successful
cultivation
and
that
too
in
comparatively
recent
times
or
in
other
words
within
two
or
three
centuries
plants
grown
in
the
united
according
to
bigelow
the
united

had
on
the
first
of
june
in
round
numbers
acres
of
improved

the
quantity
having
been
increased
by
acres
within
the
ten
years
next
preceding
not
to
mention
less
important

these

were

they
were
all
introduced
into
north
america
after
the
close
of
the
sixteenth
century
of
the
fruits
of
agricultural
industry
unknown
to
the
greeks
and
romans
or
too
little
employed
by
them
to

more

the

have
introduced
into

of
tropical
america
the
sugar
cane
the
coffee

the
orange

the

all
of

origin
have
immensely
stimulated
the
cultivation
of
the
former
two
in
the
countries
of
which
they
are
natives
and
of
course
promoted
agricultural
operations
which
must
have
affected
the
geography
of
those
regions
to
an
extent
proportionate
to
the
scale
on
which
they
have
been
pursued
plants

are
very
valuable

agriculture
of

the
tomato
is
no
mean
gift
to
the

of

though
certainly
not
an
adequate
return
for
the
multitude
of
esculent
roots
and
leguminous
plants
which
the
european
colonists
carried
with
them
i
wish
i
could
believe
with
some
that
america
is
not
alone
responsible
for
the
introduction
of
the
filthy
weed
tobacco
the
use
of
which
is
the
most
vulgar
and
pernicious
habit
engrafted
by
the
of
modern
civilization
upon
the
less
multifarious
sensualism
of
ancient
life
but
the
alleged
occurrence
of
objects
in
sclavonic
and
it
has
been
said
in
hungarian
sepulchres
is
hardly
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
those
races
of
complicity
in
this
grave
offence
against
the
temperance
and
the
refinement
of
modern
society
of
introduction
of
foreign
besides
the
vegetables
i
have
mentioned
we
know
that
many
plants
of
smaller
economical
value
have
been
the
subjects
of
international
exchange

very
recent
times

that
the

of

was
an
oriental

transplanted
to
lisbon
and
still
living
in
the
last
generation
the
present

of

parterres
of

have
been
imported
from

japan
and
other

oriental
countries
within
a
century
and
a
half
and
in

there
are
few
vegetables
of
any
agricultural
importance
few
ornamental
trees
or
decorative
plants
which
are
not
now
common
to
the
three
civilized
continents
the
statistics
of
vegetable
emigration
exhibit
numerical
results
quite
surprising
to
those
not
familiar
with
the
subject
the
lonely
island
of
helena
is
described
as
producing
at
the
time
of
its
discovery
in
the
year
about
sixty
vegetable
species
including
some
three
or
four
known
to
grow
elsewhere
also
at
the
present
time
its
flora
numbers
seven
hundred
and
fifty
species
humboldt

bonpland
found
among
the
unquestionably
indigenous
plants
of
tropical
america
monocotyledons
only
all
the
dicotyledons
of
those
extensive
regions
having
been
probably
introduced
after
the
colonization
of
the
new
world
by
spain
the
faculty
of
spontaneous
reproduction
and
perpetuation
necessarily
supposes
a
greater
power
of
accommodation
within
a
certain
range
than
we
find
in
most
domesticated
plants
for
it
would
rarely
happen
that
the
seed
of
a
wild
plant
would
fall
into
ground
as
nearly
similar
in
composition
and
condition
to
that
where
its
parent
grew
as
the
soils
of
different
fields
artificially
prepared
for
growing
a
particular
vegetable
are
to
each
other
accordingly
though
every
wild
species
affects
a
habitat
of
a
particular
character
it
is
found
that
if
accidentally
or
designedly
sown
elsewhere
it
will
grow
under
conditions
extremely
unlike
those
of
its
birthplace
cooper
says
we
can
not
say
positively
that
plant
is
anywhere
until
it
has
been
tried
and
this
seems
to
be
even
more
true
of
wild
than
of
domesticated
vegetation
the
seven
hundred
new
species
which
have
found
their
way
to
helena
within
three
centuries
and
a
half
were
certainly
not
all
or
even
in
the
largest
proportion
designedly
planted
there
by
human
art
and
if
we
were
well
acquainted
with
vegetable
emigration
we
should
probably
be
able
to
show
that
man
has
intentionally
transferred
fewer
plants
than
he
has
accidentally
introduced
into
countries
foreign
to
them

it
is
a
fact
of
very
familiar
observation
that
exotics
transplanted
to
foreign
climates
suited
to
their

often
escape
from
the
flower

and
naturalize
themselves
among
the
spontaneous

in

scattered
upon

and
the
next
season
there
sprang
up
from
the

no
less
than
species
of
plants
belonging
to
the
roman
campagna
some
of
which
were
preserved
and
cultivated
as
a
new
tribute
to
the

of

the
european
cardoon
an
esculent

has
broken
out
from
the
gardens
of
the
spanish
colonies
on
the
la
plata
acquired
a
gigantic
stature
and
propagated
itself
in
impenetrable
thickets
over
hundreds
of
leagues
of
the
pampas
and
the
a
water
plant
not
much
inclined
to
spread
in
its
native
american
habitat
has
found
its
way
into
english
rivers
and
extended
itself
to
such
a
degree
as
to
form
a
serious
obstruction
to
the
flow
of
the
current
and
even
to
navigation
not
only
do
many
wild
plants
exhibit
a
remarkable
facility
of
accommodation
but
their
seeds
usually
possess
great
tenacity
of
life
and
their
germinating
power
resists
very
severe
trials
hence
while
the
seeds
of
very
many
cultivated
vegetables
lose
their
vitality
in
two
or
three
years
and
can
be
transported
safely
to
distant
countries
only
with
great
precautions
the
weeds
that
infest
those
vegetables

not
cared
for
by

to

in

of

and
tamely

dominion
of

not
only
is
the
wild
plant
much
hardier
than
the
domesticated
vegetable
but
the
same
law
prevails
in
animated
brute
and
even
human
life
the
beasts
of
the
chase
are
more
capable
of
endurance
and
privation
and
more
tenacious
of
life
than
the
domesticated
animals
which
most
nearly
resemble
them
the
savage

on
after
he
has
received
half
a
dozen
mortal
wounds
the
least
of
which
would
have
instantly
paralyzed
the

of
his
civilized
enemy
and
like
the
wild
boar
he
has
been
known
to
press
forward
along
the

of

was
transpiercing
his

be
gradually
acclimatized
to
bear
a
degree
of
heat
or
of

which
in
their
wild
state
they
would
not
have
supported
the
trained
english
racer
outstrips
the
swiftest
horse
of
the
pampas
or
prairies
perhaps
even
the
less
systematically
educated
courser
of
the
arab
the
strength
of
the
european
as
tested
by
the
dynamometer
is
greater
than
that
of
the
new
zealander
but
all
these
are
instances
of
excessive
development
of
particular
capacities
and
faculties
at
the
expense
of
general
vital
power
expose
untamed
and
domesticated
forms
of
life
together
to
an
entire
set
of
physical
conditions
equally
alien
to
the
former
habits
of
both
so
that
every
power
of
resistance
and
accommodation
shall
be
called
into
action
and
the
wild
plant
or
animal
will
live
while
the
domesticated
will
perish
the
saline
atmosphere
of
the
sea
is
specially
injurious
both
to
seeds
and
to
very
many
young
plants
and
it
is
only
recently
that
the
transportation
of
some
very
important
vegetables
across
the
ocean
has
been
made
practicable
through
the
invention
of
ward
airtight
glass
cases
it
is
by
this
means
that
large
numbers
of
the
trees
which
produce
the
jesuit
bark
have
been
successfully
transplanted
from
america
to
the
british
possessions
in
the
east
where
it
is
hoped
they
will
become
fully
naturalized
of
lamentable
as
are
the
evils
produced
by
the
too
general
felling
of
the
woods
in
the
old
world
i
believe
it
does
not
satisfactorily
appear
that
any
species
of
native
forest
tree
has
yet
been
extirpated
by
man
on
the
eastern
continent
the
roots
stumps
trunks
and
foliage
found
in
bogs
are
recognized
as
belonging
to
still
extant
species
except
in
some
few
cases
where
there
is
historical
evidence
that
foreign
material
was
employed
the
timber
of
the
oldest
european
buildings
and
even
of
the
lacustrine
habitations
of
switzerland
is
evidently
the
product
of
trees
still
common
in
or
near
the
countries
where
such
architectural
remains
are
found
nor
have
the
egyptian
catacombs
themselves
revealed
to
us
the
former
existence
of
any
woods
not
now
familiar
to
us
as
the
growth
of
still
living
trees
it
is
however
said
that
the
yew
tree
formerly
very
common
in
england
germany
and
as
we
are
authorized
to
infer
from
theophrastus
in
greece
has
almost
wholly
disappeared
from
the
latter
country
and
seems
to
be
dying
out
in
germany
the
wood
of
the
yew
surpasses
that
of
any
other
european
tree
in
closeness
and
fineness
of
grain
and
it
is
well
known
for
the
elasticity
which
of
old
made
it
so
great
a
favorite
with
the
english
archer
it
is
much
in
request
among
wood
carvers
and
turners
and
the
demand
for
it
explains
in
part
its
increasing
scarcity
it
is
also
worth
remarking
that
no
insect
depends
upon
it
for
food
or
shelter
or
aids
in
its
fructification
no
bird
feeds
upon
its
berries
the
latter
a
circumstance
of
some
importance
because
the
tree
hence
wants
one
means
of
propagation
or
diffusion
common
to
so
many
other
plants
but
it
is
alleged
that
the
reproductive
power
of
the
yew
is
exhausted
and
that
it
can
no
longer
be
readily
propagated
by
the
natural
sowing
of
its
seeds
or
by
artificial
methods
if
further
investigation
and
careful
experiment
should
establish
this
fact
it
will
go
far
to
show
that
a
climatic
change
of
a
character
unfavorable
to
the
growth
of
the
yew
has
really
taken
place
in
germany
though
not
yet
proved
by
instrumental
observation
and
the
most
probable
cause
of
such
change
would
be
found
in
the
diminution
of
the
area
covered
by
the
forests
the
industry
of
man
is
said
to
have
been
so
successful
in
the
local
extirpation
of
noxious
or
useless
vegetables
in
china
that
with
the
exception
of
a
few
water
plants
in
the
rice
grounds
it
is
sometimes
impossible
to
find
a
single
weed
in
an
extensive
district
and
the
late
eminent
agriculturist
coke
is
reported
to
have
offered
in
vain
a
considerable
reward
for
the
detection
of
a
weed
in
a
large
wheatfield
on
his
estate
in
england
in
these
cases
however
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
diligent
husbandry
has
done
more
than
to
eradicate
the
pests
of
agriculture
within
a
comparatively
limited
area
and
the
cockle
and
the
darnel
will
probably
remain
to
plague
the
slovenly
cultivator
as
long
as
the
cereal
grains
continue
to
bless
him
of
domestic
one
of
the
most
important
and
at
the
same
time
most
difficult
questions
connected
with
our
subject
is
how
far
we
are
to
regard
our
cereal
grains
our
esculent
bulbs
and
roots
and
the
multiplied
tree
fruits
of
our
gardens
as
artificially
modified
and
improved
forms
of
wild
vegetation
the
narratives
of
botanical
travellers
have
often
announced
the
discovery
of
the
original
form
and
habitat
of
domesticated
plants
and
scientific
journals
have
described
the
experiments
by
which
the
identity
of
particular
wild
and
cultivated
vegetables
has
been
thought
to
be
established
it
is
confidently
affirmed
that
maize
and
the
potato
which
we
must
suppose
to
have
been
first
cultivated
at
a
much
later
period
than
the
breadstuffs
and
most
other
esculent
vegetables
of
europe
and
the
east
are
found
wild
and
in
spanish
america
though
in
forms
not
recognizable
by
the
common
observer
as
identical
with
the
familiar
corn
and
tuber
of
modern
agriculture
it
was
lately
asserted
upon
what
seemed
very
strong
evidence
that
the
a
plant
growing
wild
in
southern
france
had
been
actually
converted
into
common
wheat
but
upon
a
repetition
of
the
experiments
later
observers
have
declared
that
the
apparent
change
was
only
a
case
of
temporary
hybridation
or
fecundation
by
the
pollen
of
true
wheat
and
that
the
grass
alleged
to
be
transformed
into
wheat
could
not
be
perpetuated
as
such
from
its
own
seed
the
very
great
modifications
which
cultivated
plants
are
constantly
undergoing
under
our
eyes
and
the
numerous
varieties
and
races
which
spring
up
among
them
certainly
countenance
the
doctrine
that
every
domesticated
vegetable
however
dependent
upon
human
care
for
growth
and
propagation
in
its
present
form
may
have
been
really
derived
by
a
long
succession
of
changes
from
some
wild
plant
not
now
much
resembling
it
but
it
is
in
every
case
a
question
of
evidence
the
only
satisfactory
proof
that
a
given
wild
plant
is
identical
with
a
given
garden
or
field
vegetable
is
the
test
of
experiment
the
actual
growing
of
the
one
from
the
seed
of
the
other
or
the
conversion
of
the
one
into
the
other
by
transplantation
and
change
of
conditions
it
is
hardly
contended
that
any
of
the
cereals
or
other
plants
important
as
human
aliment
or
as
objects
of
agricultural
industry
exist
and
propagate
themselves
uncultivated
in
the
same
form
and
with
the
same
properties
as
when
sown
and
reared
by
human
art
in
fact
the
cases
are
rare
where
the
identity
of
a
wild
with
a
domesticated
plant
is
considered
by
the
best
authorities
as
conclusively
established
and
we
are
warranted
in
affirming
of
but
few
of
the
latter
as
a
historically
known
or
experimentally
proved
fact
that
they
ever
did
exist
or
could
exist
independently
of
man
life
as
a
geological
and
geographical
the
quantitative
value
of
organic
life
as
a
geological
agency
seems
to
be
inversely
as
the
volume
of
the
individual
organism
for
nature
supplies
by
numbers
what
is
wanting
in
the
bulk
of
the
plant
or
animal
out
of
whose
remains
or
structures
she
forms
strata
covering
whole
provinces
and
builds
up
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
large
islands
if
not
continents
there
are
it
is
true
near
the
mouths
of
the
great
siberian
rivers
which
empty
themselves
into
the
polar
sea
drift
islands
composed
in
an
incredibly
large
proportion
of
the
bones
and
tusks
of
elephants
mastodons
and
other
huge
pachyderms
and
many
extensive
caves
in
various
parts
of
the
world
are
half
filled
with
the
skeletons
of
quadrupeds
sometimes
lying
loose
in
the
earth
sometimes
cemented
together
into
an
osseous
breccia
by
a
calcareous
deposit
or
other
binding
material
these
remains
of
large
animals
though
found
in
comparatively
late
formations
generally
belong
to
extinct
species
and
their
modern
congeners
or
representatives
do
not
exist
in
sufficient
numbers
to
be
of
sensible
importance
in
geology
or
in
geography
by
the
mere
mass
of
their
skeletons
but
the
vegetable
products
found
with
them
and
in
rare
cases
in
the
stomachs
of
some
of
them
are
those
of
yet
extant
plants
and
besides
this
evidence
the
recent
discovery
of
works
of
human
art
deposited
in
juxtaposition
with
fossil
bones
and
evidently
at
the
same
time
and
by
the
same
agency
which
buried
these
latter
not
to
speak
of
alleged
human
bones
found
in
the
same
strata
proves
that
the
animals
whose
former
existence
they
testify
were
contemporaneous
with
man
and
possibly
even
extirpated
by
him
i
do
not
propose
to
enter
upon
the
thorny
question
whether
the
existing
races
of
man
are
genealogically
connected
with
these
ancient
types
of
humanity
and
i
advert
to
these
facts
only
for
the
sake
of
the
suggestion
that
man
in
his
earliest
known
stages
of
existence
was
probably
a
destructive
power
upon
the
earth
though
perhaps
not
so
emphatically
as
his
present
representatives
the
larger
wild
animals
are
not
now
numerous
enough
in
any
one
region
to
form
extensive
deposits
by
their
remains
but
they
have
nevertheless
a
certain
geographical
importance
if
the
myriads
of
large
browsing
and
grazing
quadrupeds
which
wander
over
the
plains
of
southern
africa
and
the
slaughter
of
which
by
thousands
is
the
source
of
a
ferocious
pleasure
and
a
brutal
triumph
to
professedly
civilized
hunters
if
the
herds
of
the
american
bison
which
are
numbered
by
hundreds
of
thousands
do
not
produce
visible
changes
in
the
forms
of
terrestrial
surface
they
have
at
least
an
immense
influence
on
the
growth
and
distribution
of
vegetable
life
and
of
course
indirectly
upon
all
the
physical
conditions
of
soil
and
climate
between
which
and
vegetation
a
mutual
interdependence
exists
the
influence
of
wild
quadrupeds
upon
vegetable
life
has
been
little
studied
and
not
many
facts
bearing
upon
it
have
been
recorded
but
so
far
as
it
is
known
it
appears
to
be
conservative
rather
than
pernicious
few
if
any
of
them
depend
for
their
subsistence
on
vegetable
products
obtainable
only
by
the
destruction
of
the
plant
and
they
seem
to
confine
their
consumption
almost
exclusively
to
the
annual
harvest
of
leaf
or
twig
or
at
least
of
parts
of
the
vegetable
easily
reproduced
if
there
are
exceptions
to
this
rule
they
are
in
cases
where
the
numbers
of
the
animal
are
so
proportioned
to
the
abundance
of
the
vegetable
that
there
is
no
danger
of
the
extermination
of
the
plant
from
the
voracity
of
the
quadruped
or
of
the
extinction
of
the
quadruped
from
the
scarcity
of
the
plant
in
diet
and
natural
wants
the
bison
resembles
the
ox
the
ibex
and
the
chamois
assimilate
themselves
to
the
goat
and
the
sheep
but
while
the
wild
animal
does
not
appear
to
be
a
destructive
agency
in
the
garden
of
nature
his
domestic
congeners
are
eminently
so
this
is
partly
from
the
change
of
habits
resulting
from
domestication
and
association
with
man
partly
from
the
fact
that
the
number
of
reclaimed
animals
is
not
determined
by
the
natural
relation
of
demand
and
spontaneous
supply
which
regulates
the
multiplication
of
wild
creatures
but
by
the
convenience
of
man
who
is
in
comparatively
few
things
amenable
to
the
control
of
the
merely
physical
arrangements
of
nature
when
the
domesticated
animal
escapes
from
human
jurisdiction
as
in
the
case
of
the
ox
the
horse
the
goat
and
perhaps
the
ass
which
so
far
as
i
know
are
the
only
instances
of
the
complete
emancipation
of
household
quadrupeds
he
becomes
again
an
unresisting
subject
of
nature
and
all
his
economy
is
governed
by
the
same
laws
as
that
of
his
fellows
which
have
never
been
enslaved
by
man
but
so
long
as
he
obeys
a
human
lord
he
is
an
auxiliary
in
the
warfare
his
master
is
ever
waging
against
all
existences
except
those
which
he
can
tame
to
a
willing
servitude
of
quadrupeds
in
the
united
civilization
is
so
intimately
associated
with
if
not
dependent
upon
certain
inferior
forms
of
animal
life
that
cultivated
man
has
never
failed
to
accompany
himself
in
all
his
migrations
with
some
of
these
humble
attendants
the
ox
the
horse
the
sheep
and
even
the
comparatively
useless
dog
and
cat
as
well
as
several
species
of
poultry
are
voluntarily
transported
by
every
emigrant
colony
and
they
soon
multiply
to
numbers
very
far
exceeding
those
of
the
wild
genera
most
nearly
corresponding
to
them
according
to
the
census
of
the
united
states
for
the
total
number
of
horses
in
all
the
states
of
the
american
union
was
in
round
numbers
of
asses
and
mules
of
the
ox
tribe
of
sheep
and
of
swine
the
only
north
american
quadruped
sufficiently
gregarious
in
habits
and
sufficiently
multiplied
in
numbers
to
form
really
large
herds
is
the
bison
or
as
he
is
commonly
called
in
america
the
buffalo
and
this
animal
is
confined
to
the
prairie
region
of
the
mississippi
basin
and
northern
mexico
the
engineers
sent
out
to
survey
railroad
routes
to
the
pacific
estimated
the
number
of
a
single
herd
of
bisons
seen
within
the
last
ten
years
on
the
great
plains
near
the
upper
missouri
at
not
less
than
and
yet
the
range
occupied
by
this
animal
is
now
very
much
smaller
in
area
than
it
was
when
the
whites
first
established
themselves
on
the
prairies
but
it
must
be
remarked
that
the
american
buffalo
is
a
migratory
animal
and
that
at
the
season
of
his
annual
journeys
the
whole
stock
of
a
vast
extent
of
pasture
ground
is
collected
into
a
single
army
which
is
seen
at
or
very
near
any
one
point
only
for
a
few
days
during
the
entire
season
hence
there
is
risk
of
great
error
in
estimating
the
numbers
of
the
bison
in
a
given
district
from
the
magnitude
of
the
herds
seen
at
or
about
the
same
time
at
a
single
place
of
observation
and
upon
the
whole
it
is
neither
proved
nor
probable
that
the
bison
was
ever
at
any
one
time
as
numerous
in
north
america
as
the
domestic
bovine
species
is
at
present
the
elk
the
moose
the
musk
ox
the
caribou
and
the
smaller
quadrupeds
popularly
embraced
under
the
general
name
of
deer
though
sufficient
for
the
wants
of
a
sparse
savage
population
were
never
numerically
very
abundant
and
the
carnivora
which
fed
upon
them
were
still
less
so
it
is
almost
needless
to
add
that
the
rocky
mountain
sheep
and
goat
must
always
have
been
very
rare
summing
up
the
whole
then
it
is
evident
that
the
wild
quadrupeds
of
north
america
even
when
most
numerous
were
few
compared
with
their
domestic
successors
that
they
required
a
much
less
supply
of
vegetable
food
and
consequently
were
far
less
important
as
geographical
elements
than
the
many
millions
of
hoofed
and
horned
cattle
now
fed
by
civilized
man
on
the
same
continent
and
transfer
of
domestic
of
the
origin
of
our
domestic
animals
we
know
historically
nothing
because
their
domestication
belongs
to
the
ages
which
preceded
written
history
but
though
they
can
not
all
be
specifically
identified
with
now
extant
wild
animals
it
is
presumable
that
they
have
been
reclaimed
from
an
originally
wild
state
ancient
annalists
have
preserved
to
us
fewer
data
respecting
the
introduction
of
domestic
animals
into
new
countries
than
respecting
the
transplantation
of
domestic
vegetables
ritter
in
his
learned
essay
on
the
camel
has
shown
that
this
animal
was
not
employed
by
the
egyptians
until
a
comparatively
late
period
in
their
history
that
he
was
unknown
to
the
carthaginians
until
after
the
downfall
of
their
commonwealth
and
that
his
first
appearance
in
western
africa
is
more
recent
still
the
bactrian
camel
was
certainly
brought
from
asia
minor
to
the
northern
shores
of
the
black
sea
by
the
goths
in
the
third
or
fourth
century
the
arabian
camel
or
dromedary
has
been
carried
to
the
canary
islands
partially
introduced
into
australia
greece
spain
and
even
tuscany
experimented
upon
to
little
purpose
in
venezuela
and
finally
imported
by
the
american
government
into
texas
and
new
mexico
where
it
finds
the
climate
and
the
vegetable
products
best
suited
to
its
wants
and
promises
to
become
a
very
useful
agent
in
the
promotion
of
the
special
civilization
for
which
those
regions
are
adapted
america
had
no
domestic
quadruped
but
a
species
of
dog
the
lama
tribe
and
to
a
certain
extent
the
bison
or
buffalo
of
course
it
owes
the
horse
the
ass
the
ox
the
sheep
the
goat
and
the
swine
as
does
also
australia
to
european
colonization
modern
europe
has
thus
far
not
accomplished
much
in
the
way
of
importation
of
new
animals
though
some
interesting
essays
have
been
made
the
reindeer
was
successfully
introduced
into
iceland
about
a
century
ago
while
similar
attempts
failed
about
the
same
time
in
scotland
the
cashmere
or
thibet
goat
was
brought
to
france
a
generation
since
and
succeeds
well
the
same
or
an
allied
species
and
the
asiatic
buffalo
were
carried
to
south
carolina
about
the
year
and
the
former
at
least
is
thought
likely
to
prove
of
permanent
value
in
the
united
states
the
yak
or
tartary
ox
seems
to
thrive
in
france
and
success
has
attended
the
recent
efforts
to
introduce
the
south
american
alpaca
into
europe
of
although
man
never
fails
greatly
to
diminish
and
is
perhaps
destined
ultimately
to
exterminate
such
of
the
larger
wild
quadrupeds
as
he
can
not
profitably
domesticate
yet
their
numbers
often
fluctuate
and
even
after
they
seem
almost
extinct
they
sometimes
suddenly
increase
without
any
intentional
steps
to
promote
such
a
result
on
his
part
during
the
wars
which
followed
the
french
revolution
the
wolf
multiplied
in
many
parts
of
europe
partly
because
the
hunters
were
withdrawn
from
the
woods
to
chase
a
nobler
game
and
partly
because
the
bodies
of
slain
men
and
horses
supplied
this
voracious
quadruped
with
more
abundant
food
the
same
animal
became
again
more
numerous
in
poland
after
the
general
disarming
of
the
rural
population
by
the
russian
government
on
the
other
hand
when
the
hunters
pursue
the
wolf
the
graminivorous
wild
quadrupeds
increase
and
thus
in
turn
promote
the
multiplication
of
their
great
destroyer
by
augmenting
the
supply
of
his
nourishment
so
long
as
the
fur
of
the
beaver
was
extensively
employed
as
a
material
for
fine
hats
it
bore
a
very
high
price
and
the
chase
of
this
quadruped
was
so
keen
that
naturalists
feared
its
speedy
extinction
when
a
parisian
manufacturer
invented
the
silk
hat
which
soon
came
into
almost
universal
use
the
demand
for
beavers
fur
fell
off
and
this
animal
whose
habits
as
we
have
seen
are
an
important
agency
in
the
formation
of
bogs
and
other
modifications
of
forest
nature
immediately
began
to
increase
reappeared
in
haunts
which
he
had
long
abandoned
and
can
no
longer
be
regarded
as
rare
enough
to
be
in
immediate
danger
of
extirpation
thus
the
convenience
or
the
caprice
of
parisian
fashion
has
unconsciously
exercised
an
influence
which
may
sensibly
affect
the
physical
geography
of
a
distant
continent
since
the
invention
of
gunpowder
some
quadrupeds
have
completely
disappeared
from
many
european
and
asiatic
countries
where
they
were
formerly
numerous
the
last
wolf
was
killed
in
great
britain
two
hundred
years
ago
and
the
bear
was
extirpated
from
that
island
still
earlier
the
british
wild
ox
exists
only
in
a
few
english
and
scottish
parks
while
in
irish
bogs
of
no
great
apparent
antiquity
are
found
antlers
which
testify
to
the
former
existence
of
a
stag
much
larger
than
any
extant
european
species
the
lion
is
believed
to
have
inhabited
asia
minor
and
syria
and
probably
greece
and
sicily
also
long
after
the
commencement
of
the
historical
period
and
he
is
even
said
to
have
been
not
yet
extinct
in
the
two
of
these
countries
at
the
time
of
the
first
crusades
two
large
graminivorous
or
browsing
quadrupeds
the
ur
and
the
schelk
once
common
in
germany
are
utterly
extinct
the
eland
and
the
auerochs
nearly
so
the
which
in
the
oldest
form
preserved
to
us
dates
from
about
the
year
though
its
original
composition
no
doubt
belongs
to
an
earlier
period
thus

dowghtie
sigfrid
a
wisent
and
an
elk
he
smote
four
stoute
uroxen
and
a
grim
and
sturdie
schelk
modern
naturalists
identify
the
elk
with
the
eland
the
wisent
with
the
auerochs
the
period
when
the
ur
and
the
schelk
became
extinct
is
not
known
the
auerochs
survived
in
prussia
until
the
middle
of
the
last
century
but
unless
it
is
identical
with
a
similar
quadruped
said
to
be
found
on
the
caucasus
it
now
exists
only
in
the
russian
imperial
forest
of
bialowitz
where
about
a
thousand
are
still
preserved
and
in
some
great
menageries
as
for
example
that
at
schönbrunn
near
vienna
which
in
had
four
specimens
the
eland
which
is
closely
allied
to
the
american
wapiti
if
not
specifically
the
same
animal
is
still
kept
in
the
royal
preserves
of
prussia
to
the
number
of
four
or
five
hundred
individuals
the
chamois
is
becoming
rare
and
the
ibex
or
steinbock
once
common
in
all
the
high
alps
is
now
believed
to
be
confined
to
the
cogne
mountains
in
piedmont
between
the
valleys
of
the
dora
baltea
and
the
orco
of
birds
in
the
united
the
tame
fowls
play
a
much
less
conspicuous
part
in
rural
life
than
the
quadrupeds
and
in
their
relations
to
the
economy
of
nature
they
are
of
very
much
less
moment
than
animals
or
than
the
undomesticated
birds
the
domestic
turkey
is
probably
more
numerous
in
the
territory
of
the
united
states
than
the
wild
bird
of
the
same
species
ever
was
and
the
grouse
can
not
at
the
period
of
their
greatest
abundance
have
counted
as
many
as
we
now
number
of
the
common
hen
the
dove
however
must
fall
greatly
short
of
the
wild
pigeon
in
multitude
and
it
is
hardly
probable
that
the
flocks
of
domestic
geese
and
ducks
are
as
numerous
as
once
were
those
of
their
wild
congeners
the
pigeon
indeed
seems
to
have
multiplied
immensely
for
some
years
after
the
first
clearings
in
the
woods
because
the
settlers
warred
unsparingly
upon
the
hawk
while
the
crops
of
grain
and
other
vegetable
growths
increased
the
supply
of
food
within
the
reach
of
the
young
birds
at
the
age
when
their
power
of
flight
is
not
yet
great
enough
to
enable
them
to
seek
it
over
a
wide
area
the
pigeon
is
not
described
by
the
earliest
white
inhabitants
of
the
american
states
as
filling
the
air
with
such
clouds
of
winged
life
as
astonish
naturalists
in
the
descriptions
of
audubon
and
at
the
present
day
the
net
and
the
gun
have
so
reduced
its
abundance
that
its
appearance
in
large
numbers
is
recorded
only
at
long
intervals
and
it
is
never
seen
in
the
great
flocks
remembered
by
many
still
living
observers
as
formerly
very
common
as
sowers
and
consumers
of
seeds
and
as
destroyers
of
wild
birds
form
of
themselves
a
very
conspicuous
and
interesting
feature
in
the
as
painters
call
it
of
the
natural
landscape
and
they
are
important
elements
in
the
view
we
are
taking
of
geography
whether
we
consider
their
immediate
or
their
incidental
influence
birds
affect
vegetation
directly
by
sowing
seeds
and
by
consuming
them
they
affect
it
indirectly
by
destroying
insects
injurious
or
in
some
cases
beneficial
to
vegetable
life
hence
when
we
kill
a
bird
we
check
the
dissemination
of
a
plant
when
we
kill
a
bird
which
digests
the
seed
it
swallows
we
promote
the
increase
of
a
vegetable
nature
protects
the
seeds
of
wild
much
more
effectually
than
those
of
domesticated
plants
the
cereal
grains
are
completely
digested
when
consumed
by
birds
but
the
germ
of
the
smaller
stone
fruits
and
of
very
many
other
wild
vegetables
is
uninjured
perhaps
even
stimulated
to
more
vigorous
growth
by
the
natural
chemistry
of
the
bird
stomach
the
power
of
flight
and
the
restless
habits
of
the
bird
enable
it
to
transport
heavy
seeds
to
far
greater
distances
than
they
could
be
carried
by
the
wind
a
bird
may
drop
cherry
stones
a
thousand
miles
from
the
tree
they
grow
on
a
hawk
in
tearing
a
pigeon
may
scatter
from
its
crop
the
still
fresh
rice
it
had
swallowed
at
a
distance
of
ten
degrees
of
latitude
and
thus
the
occurrence
of
isolated
plants
in
situations
where
their
presence
can
not
otherwise
well
be
explained
is
easily
accounted
for
there
is
a
large
class
of
seeds
apparently
specially
fitted
by
nature
for
dissemination
by
animals
i
refer
to
those
which
attach
themselves
by
means
of
hooks
or
by
viscous
juices
to
the
coats
of
quadrupeds
and
the
feathers
of
birds
and
are
thus
transported
wherever
their
living
vehicles
may
chance
to
wander
some
birds
too
deliberately
bury
seeds
not
indeed
with
a
foresight
aiming
directly
at
the
propagation
of
the
plant
but
from
apparently
purposeless
secretiveness
or
as
a
mode
of
preserving
food
for
future
use
an
unfortunate
popular
error
greatly
magnifies
the
injury
done
to
the
crops
of
grain
and
leguminous
vegetables
by
wild
birds
very
many
of
those
generally
supposed
to
consume
large
quantities
of
the
seeds
of
cultivated
plants
really
feed
almost
exclusively
upon
insects
and
frequent
the
wheatfields
not
for
the
sake
of
the
grain
but
for
the
eggs
larvæ
and
fly
of
the
multiplied
tribes
of
insect
life
which
are
so
destructive
to
the
harvests
this
fact
has
been
so
well
established
by
the
examination
of
the
stomachs
of
great
numbers
of
birds
in
europe
and
new
england
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
that
it
is
no
longer
open
to
doubt
and
it
appears
highly
probable
that
even
the
species
which
consume
more
or
less
grain
generally
make
amends
by
destroying
insects
whose
ravages
would
have
been
still
more
injurious
on
this
subject
we
have
much
other
evidence
besides
that
derived
from
dissection
direct
observation
has
shown
in
many
instances
that
the
destruction
of
wild
birds
has
been
followed
by
a
great
multiplication
of
noxious
insects
and
on
the
other
hand
that
these
latter
have
been
much
reduced
in
numbers
by
the
protection
and
increase
of
the
birds
that
devour
them
many
interesting
facts
of
this
nature
have
been
collected
by
professed
naturalists
but
i
shall
content
myself
with
a
few
taken
from
familiar
and
generally
accessible
sources
the

from

the

have
made

upon

upon
the
present
moment
only
without
seeing
and
without
foreseeing
blind

is
never

the
insect
has
well
avenged
the

it
has
become
necessary
to
revoke
in
haste
the
proscription
in
the

of
bourbon
for

a
price
was
set
on
the
head
of
the

it
disappeared
and
the
grasshoppers
took
possession
of
the
island
devouring
withering
scorching
with
a
biting
drought
all
that
they
did
not
consume
in

it

nevertheless
the

not
long
since
in
the
neighborhood
of
rouen
and
in
the
valley
of
monville
the
blackbird
was
for
some
time
proscribed
the
beetles
profited
well
by
this
proscription
their
larvæ
infinitely
multiplied
carried
on
their
subterranean
labors
with
such
success
that
a
meadow
was
shown
me
the
surface
of

was
completely
dried
up
every
herbaceous
root
was
consumed
and
the
whole
grassy
mantle
easily
loosened
might
have
been
rolled
up
and
carried
away
like
a
carpet
and
extirpation
of
the
general
hostility
of
the
european
populace
to
the
smaller
birds
is
in
part
the
remote
effect
of
the
reaction
created
by
the
game
laws
when
the
restrictions
imposed
upon
the
chase
by
those
laws
were
suddenly
removed
in

the
whole

at

commenced
a
destructive
campaign

arthur
young
writing
in

on
the
of
august
soon
after
the
national
assembly
had
declared
the
chase
free
thus
complains
of
the
annoyance
he
experienced
from
the
use
made
by
the
peasantry
of
their
newly
won
liberty
one
would
think
that
every
rusty
firelock
in
all
provence
was
at
work
in
the
indiscriminate
destruction
of
all
the
birds
the
wadding
buzzed
by
my
ears
or
fell
into
my
carriage
five
or
six
times
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
declaration
of
the
assembly
that
every
man
is
free
to
hunt
on
his
own
land
has
filled
all
france
with
an
intolerable
cloud
of
sportsmen
the
declaration
speaks
of
compensations
and
indemnities
to
the
but
the
ungovernable
populace
takes
advantage
of
the
abolition
of
the

and
laughs
at
the
obligation
imposed
by
the
decree
the
french
revolution
removed
similar
restrictions
with
similar
results
in
other
countries
the
habits
then
formed
have
become
hereditary
on

still
exist
in

there
is
little
doubt
that
the
blind
prejudices
of
the
ignorant
and
classes
in
that
country
against
birds
are
in
some
degree
at
least
due
to
a
legislation
which
by
restricting
the
chase
of
all
game
worth
killing
drives
the
unprivileged
sportsman
to
indemnify
himself
by
slaughtering
all
wild
life
which
is
not
reserved
for
the
amusement
of
his
betters
hence
the
lord
of
the
manor
buys
his
partridges
and
his
hares
by
sacrificing
the
bread
of
his
tenants
and
so
long
as
the
farmers
of
crawley
are
forbidden
to
follow
higher
game
they
will
suicidally
revenge
themselves
by
destroying
the
sparrows
which
protect
their
wheatfields
on
the
continent
and
especially
in
italy
the
comparative
scarcity
and
dearness
of
animal
food
combine
with
the
feeling
i
have
just
mentioned
to
stimulate
still
further
the
destructive
passions
of
the
fowler
in
the
tuscan
province
of
grosseto
containing
less
than
square
miles
nearly
thrushes
and
other
small
birds
are
annually
brought
to
market
birds
are
less
hardy
in
constitution
they
possess
less
facility
of
accommodation
and
they
are
more
severely
affected
by
climatic
excess
than
quadrupeds
besides
they
generally
want
the
means
of
shelter
against
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
and
against
pursuit
by
their
enemies
which
holes
and
dens
afford
to
burrowing
animals
and
to
some
larger
beasts
of
prey
the
egg
is
exposed
to
many
dangers
before
hatching
and
the
young
bird
is
especially
tender
defenceless
and
helpless
every
cold
rain
every
violent
wind
every
hailstorm
during
the
breeding
season
destroys
hundreds
of
nestlings
and
the
parent
often
perishes
with
her
progeny
while
brooding
over
it
in
the
vain
effort
to
protect
it
the
great
proportional
numbers
of
birds
their
migratory
habits
and
the
ease
with
which
they
may
escape
most
dangers
that
beset
them
would
seem
to
secure
them
from
extirpation
and
even
from
very
great
numerical
reduction
but
experience
shows
that
when
not
protected
by
law
by
popular
favor
or
superstition
or
by
other
special
circumstances
they
yield
very
readily
to
the
hostile
influences
of
civilization
and
though
the
first
operations
of
the
settler
are
favorable
to
the
increase
of
many
species
the
great
extension
of
rural
and
of
mechanical
industry
is
in
a
variety
of
ways
destructive
even
to
tribes
not
directly
warred
upon
by
man
nature
sets
bounds
to
the
disproportionate
increase
of
birds
while
at
the
same
time
by
the
multitude
of
their
resources
she
secures
them
from
extinction
through
her
own
spontaneous
agencies
man
both
preys
upon
them
and
wantonly
destroys
them
the
delicious
flavor
of
game
birds
and
the
skill
implied
in
the
various
arts
of
the
sportsman
who
devotes
himself
to
fowling
make
them
favorite
objects
of
the
chase
while
the
beauty
of
their
plumage
as
a
military
and
feminine
decoration
threatens
to
involve
the
sacrifice
of
the
last
survivor
of
many
once
numerous
species
thus
far
but
few
birds
described
by
ancient
or
modern
naturalists
are
known
to
have
become
absolutely
extinct
though
there
are
some
cases
in
which
they
are
ascertained
to
have
utterly
disappeared
from
the
face
of
the
earth
in
very
recent
times
the
most
familiar
instances
are
those
of
the
dodo
a
large
bird
peculiar
to
the
mauritius
or
isle
of
france
exterminated
about
the
year
and
now
known
only
by
two
or
three
fragments
of
skeletons
and
the
solitary
which
inhabited
the
islands
of
bourbon
and
rodriguez
but
has
not
been
seen
for
more
than
a
century
a
parrot
and
some
other
birds
of
the
norfolk
island
group
are
said
to
have
lately
become
extinct
the
wingless
auk
a
bird
remarkable
for
its
excessive
fatness
was
very
abundant
two
or
three
hundred
years
ago
in
the
faroe
islands
and
on
the
whole
scandinavian
seaboard
the
early
voyagers
found
either
the
same
or
a
closely
allied
species
in
immense
numbers
on
all
the
coasts
and
islands
of
newfoundland
the
value
of
its
flesh
and
its
oil
made
it
one
of
the
most
important
resources
of
the
inhabitants
of
those
sterile
regions
and
it
was
naturally
an
object
of
keen
pursuit
it
is
supposed
to
be
now
completely
extinct
and
few
museums
can
show
even
its
skeleton
there
seems
to
be
strong
reason
to
believe
that
our
boasted
modern
civilization
is
guiltless
of
one
or
two
sins
of
extermination
which
have
been
committed
in
recent
ages
new
zealand
formerly
possessed
three
species
of
dinornis
one
of
which
called
by
the
islanders
was
much
larger
than
the
ostrich
the
condition
in
which
the
bones
of
these
birds
have
been
found
and
the
traditions
of
the
natives
concur
to
prove
that
though
the
aborigines
had
probably
extirpated
them
before
the
discovery
of
new
zealand
by
the
whites
they
still
existed
at
a
comparatively
late
period
the
same
remarks
apply
to
a
winged
giant
the
eggs
of
which
have
been
brought
from
madagascar
this
bird
must
have
much
exceeded
the
dimensions
of
the
moa
at
least
so
far
as
we
can
judge
from
the
egg
which
is
eight
times
as
large
as
the
average
size
of
the
ostrich
egg
or
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
times
that
of
the
hen
but
though
we
have
no
evidence
that
man
has
exterminated
many
species
of
birds
we
know
that
his
persecutions
have
caused
their
disappearance
from
many
localities
where
they
once
were
common
and
greatly
diminished
their
numbers
in
others
the
cappercailzie
the
finest
of
the
grouse
family
formerly
abundant
in
scotland
had
become
extinct
in
great
britain
but
has
been
reintroduced
from
sweden
the
ostrich
is
mentioned
by
all
the
old
travellers
as
common
on
the
isthmus
of
suez
down
to
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
appears
to
have
frequented
syria
and
even
asia
minor
at
earlier
periods
but
is
now
found
only
in
the
seclusion
of
remoter
deserts
the
modern
increased
facilities
of
transportation
have
brought
distant
markets
within
reach
of
the
professional
hunter
and
thereby
given
a
new
impulse
to
his
destructive
propensities
not
only
do
all
great
britain
and
ireland
contribute
to
the
supply
of
game
for
the
british
capital
but
the
duck
of
the
potomac
and
even
the
prairie
hen
from
the
basin
of
the
mississippi
may
be
found
at
the
stalls
of
the
london
poulterer
kohl
informs
us
that
on
the
coasts
of
the
north
sea
twenty
thousand
wild
ducks
are
usually
taken
in
the
course
of
the
season
in
a
single
decoy
and
sent
to
the
large
maritime
towns
for
sale
the
statistics
of
the
great
european
cities
show
a
prodigious
consumption
of
game
birds
but
the
official
returns
fall
far
below
the
truth
because
they
do
not
include
the
rural
districts
and
because
neither
the
poacher
nor
his
customers
report
the
number
of
his
victims
reproduction
in
cultivated
countries
can
not
keep
pace
with
this
excessive
destruction
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
all
the
wild
birds
which
are
chased
for
their
flesh
or
their
plumage
are
diminishing
with
a
rapidity
which
justifies
the
fear
that
the
last
of
them
will
soon
follow
the
dodo
and
the
wingless
auk
fortunately
the
larger
birds
which
are
pursued
for
their
flesh
or
for
their
feathers
and
those
the
eggs
of
which
are
used
as
food
are
so
far
as
we
know
the
functions
appointed
to
them
by
nature
not
otherwise
specially
useful
to
man
and
therefore
their
wholesale
destruction
is
an
economical
evil
only
in
the
same
sense
in
which
all
waste
of
productive
capital
is
an
evil
if
it
were
possible
to
confine
the
consumption
of
game
fowl
to
a
number
equal
to
the
annual
increase
the
world
would
be
a
gainer
but
not
to
the
same
extent
as
it
would
be
by
checking
the
wanton
sacrifice
of
millions
of
the
smaller
birds
which
are
of
no
real
value
as
food
but
which
as
we
have
seen
render
a
most
important
service
by
battling
in
our
behalf
as
well
as
in
their
own
against
the
countless
legions
of
humming
and
of
creeping
things
with
which
the
prolific
powers
of
insect
life
would
otherwise
cover
the
earth
of
man
has
undesignedly
introduced
into
new
districts
perhaps
fewer
species
of
birds
than
of
quadrupeds
but
the
distribution
of
birds
is
very
much
influenced
by
the
character
of
his
industry
and
the
transplantation
of
every
object
of
agricultural
production
is
at
a
longer
or
shorter
interval
followed
by
that
of
the
birds
which
feed
upon
its
seeds
or
more
frequently
upon
the
insects
it
harbors
the
vulture
the
crow
and
other
winged
scavengers
follow
the
march
of
armies
as
regularly
as
the
wolf
birds
accompany
ships
on
long
voyages
for
the
sake
of
the
offal
which
is
thrown
overboard
and
in
such
cases
it
might
often
happen
that
they
would
breed
and
become
naturalized
in
countries
where
they
had
been
unknown
before
there
is
a
familiar
story
of
an
english
bird
which
built
its
nest
in
an
unused
block
in
the
rigging
of
a
ship
and
made
one
or
two
short
voyages
with
the
vessel
while
hatching
its
eggs
had
the
young
become
fledged
while
lying
in
a
foreign
harbor
they
would
of
course
have
claimed
the
rights
of
citizenship
in
the
country
where
they
first
took
to
the
wing
some
enthusiastic
entomologist
will
perhaps
by
and
by
discover
that
insects
and
worms
are
as
essential
as
the
larger
organisms
to
the
proper
working
of
the
great
terraqueous
machine
and
we
shall
have
as
eloquent
pleas
in
defence
of
the
mosquito
and
perhaps
even
of
the
tzetze
fly
as
toussenel
and
michelet
have
framed
in
behalf
of
the
bird
the
silkworm
and
the
bee
need
no
apologist
a
gallnut
produced
by
the
puncture
of
an
insect
on
a
syrian
oak
is
a
necessary
ingredient
in
the
ink
i
am
writing
with
and
from
my
windows
i
recognize
the
grain
of
the
kermes
and
the
cochineal
in
the
gay
habiliments
of
the
holiday
groups
beneath
them
but
agriculture
too
is
indebted
to
the
insect
and
the
worm
the
ancients
according
to
pliny
were
accustomed
to
hang
branches
of
the
wild
fig
upon
the
domestic
tree
in
order
that
the
insects
which
frequented
the
former
might
hasten
the
ripening
of
the
cultivated
fig
by
their
punctures
or
as
others
suppose
might
fructify
it
by
transporting
to
it
the
pollen
of
the
wild
fruit
and
this
process
called
caprification
is
not
yet
entirely
obsolete
the
earthworms
long
ago
made
good
their
title
to
the
respect
and
gratitude
of
the
farmer
as
well
as
of
the
angler
the
utility
of
the
earthworms
has
been
pointed
out
in
many
scientific
as
well
as
in
many
agricultural
treatises
the
following
extract
cut
from
a
newspaper
will
answer
my
present
purpose
josiah
parkes
the
consulting
engineer
of
the
royal
agricultural
society
of
england
says
that
worms
are
great
assistants
to
the
drainer
and
valuable
aids
to
the
farmer
in
keeping
up
the
fertility
of
the
soil
he
says
they
love
moist
but
not
wet
soils
they
will
bore
down
to
but
not
into
water
they
multiply
rapidly
on
land
after
drainage
and
prefer
a
deeply
dried
soil
on
examining
with
thomas
hammond
of
penhurst
kent
part
of
a
field
which
he
had
deeply
drained
after
shallow
drainage
he
found
that
the
worms
had
greatly
increased
in
number
and
that
their
bores
descended
quite
to
the
level
of
the
pipes
many
worm
bores
were
large
enough
to
receive
the
little
finger
henry
handley
had
informed
him
of
a
piece
of
land
near
the
sea
in
lincolnshire
over
which
the
sea
had
broken
and
killed
all
the
worms
the
field
remained
sterile
until
the
worms
again
inhabited
it
he
also
showed
him
a
piece
of
pasture
land
near
to
his
house
in
which
worms
were
in
such
numbers
that
he
thought
their
casts
interfered
too
much
with
its
produce
which
induced
him
to
have
it
rolled
at
night
in
order
to
destroy
the
worms
the
result
was
that
the
fertility
of
the
field
greatly
declined
nor
was
it
restored
until
they
had
recruited
their
numbers
which
was
aided
by
collecting
and
transporting
multitudes
of
worms
from
the
fields
the
great
depth
into
which
worms
will
bore
and
from
which
they
push
up
fine
fertile
soil
and
cast
it
on
the
surface
has
been
admirably
traced
by
darwin
of
down
kent
who
has
shown
that
in
a
few
years
they
have
actually
elevated
the
surface
of
fields
by
a
large
layer
of
rich
mould
several
inches
thick
thus
affording
nourishment
to
the
roots
of
grasses
and
increasing
the
productiveness
of
the
soil
it
should
be
added
that
the
writer
quoted
and
others
who
have
discussed
the
subject
have
overlooked
one
very
important
element
in
the
fertilization
produced
by
earthworms
i
refer
to
the
enrichment
of
the
soil
by
their
excreta
during
life
and
by
the
decomposition
of
their
remains
when
they
die
the
manure
thus
furnished
is
as
valuable
as
the
like
amount
of
similar
animal
products
derived
from
higher
organisms
and
when
we
consider
the
prodigious
numbers
of
these
worms
found
on
a
single
square
yard
of
some
soils
we
may
easily
see
that
they
furnish
no
insignificant
contribution
to
the
nutritive
material
required
for
the
growth
of
plants
the
perforations
of
the
earthworm
mechanically
affect
the
texture
of
the
soil
and
its
permeability
by
water
and
they
therefore
have
a
certain
influence
on
the
form
and
character
of
surface
but
the
geographical
importance
of
insects
proper
as
well
as
of
worms
depends
principally
on
their
connection
with
vegetable
life
as
agents
of
its
fecundation
and
of
its
destruction
i
am
acquainted
with
no
single
fact
so
strikingly
illustrative
of
this
importance
as
the
following
statement
which
i
take
from
a
notice
of
darwin
volume
on
various
contrivances
by
which
british
and
foreign
orchids
are
fertilized
by
insects
in
the
of
october
the
net
result
is
that
some
six
thousand
species
of
orchids
are
absolutely
dependent
upon
the
agency
of
insects
for
their
fertilization
that
is
to
say
were
those
plants
unvisited
by
insects
they
would
all
rapidly
disappear
what
is
true
of
the
orchids
is
more
or
less
true
of
many
other
vegetable
families
we
do
not
know
the
limits
of
this
agency
and
many
of
the
insects
habitually
regarded
as
unqualified
pests
may
directly
or
indirectly
perform
functions
as
important
to
the
most
valuable
plants
as
the
services
rendered
by
certain
tribes
to
the
orchids
i
say
directly
or
indirectly
because
besides
the
other
arrangements
of
nature
for
checking
the
undue
multiplication
of
particular
species
she
has
established
a
police
among
insects
themselves
by
which
some
of
them
keep
down
or
promote
the
increase
of
others
for
there
are
insects
as
well
as
birds
and
beasts
of
prey
the
existence
of
an
insect
which
fertilizes
a
useful
vegetable
may
depend
on
that
of
another
which
constitutes
his
food
in
some
stage
of
his
life
and
this
other
again
may
be
as
injurious
to
some
plant
as
his
destroyer
is
beneficial
to
another
the
equation
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
is
too
complicated
a
problem
for
human
intelligence
to
solve
and
we
can
never
know
how
wide
a
circle
of
disturbance
we
produce
in
the
harmonies
of
nature
when
we
throw
the
smallest
pebble
into
the
ocean
of
organic
life
this
much
however
we
seem
authorized
to
conclude
as
often
as
we
destroy
the
balance
by
deranging
the
original
proportions
between
different
orders
of
spontaneous
life
the
law
of
requires
us
to
restore
the
equilibrium
by
either
directly
returning
the
weight
abstracted
from
one
scale
or
removing
a
corresponding
quantity
from
the
other
in
other
words
destruction
must
be
either
repaired
by
reproduction
or
compensated
by
new
destruction
in
an
opposite
quarter
the
parlor
aquarium
has
taught
even
those
to
whom
it
is
but
an
amusing
toy
that
the
balance
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
must
be
preserved
and
that
the
excess
of
either
is
fatal
to
the
other
in
the
artificial
tank
as
well
as
in
natural
waters
a
few
years
ago
the
water
of
the
cochituate
aqueduct
at
boston
became
so
offensive
in
smell
and
taste
as
to
be
quite
unfit
for
use
scientific
investigation
found
the
cause
in
the
too
scrupulous
care
with
which
aquatic
vegetation
had
been
excluded
from
the
reservoir
and
the
consequent
death
and
decay
of
the
animalculæ
which
could
not
be
shut
out
nor
live
in
the
water
without
the
vegetable
element
of
the
general
tendency
of
man
encroachments
upon
spontaneous
nature
has
been
to
increase
insect
life
at
the
expense
of
vegetation
and
of
the
smaller
quadrupeds
and
birds
doubtless
there
are
insects
in
all
woods
but
in
temperate
climates
they
are
comparatively
few
and
harmless
and
the
most
numerous
tribes
which
breed
in
the
forest
or
rather
in
its
waters
and
indeed
in
all
solitudes
are
those
which
little
injure
vegetation
such
as
mosquitoes
gnats
and
the
like
with
the
cultivated
plants
of
man
come
the
myriad
tribes
which
feed
or
breed
upon
them
and
agriculture
not
only
introduces
new
species
but
so
multiplies
the
number
of
individuals
as
to
defy
calculation
newly
introduced
vegetables
frequently
escape
for
years
the
insect
plagues
which
had
infested
them
in
their
native
habitat
but
the
importation
of
other
varieties
of
the
plant
the
exchange
of
seed
or
some
mere
accident
is
sure
in
the
long
run
to
carry
the
egg
the
larva
or
the
chrysalis
to
the
most
distant
shores
where
the
plant
assigned
to
it
by
nature
as
its
possession
has
preceded
it
for
many
years
after
the
colonization
of
the
united
states
few
or
none
of
the
insects
which
attack
wheat
in
its
different
stages
of
growth
were
known
in
america
during
the
revolutionary
war
the
hessian
fly
made
its
appearance
and
it
was
so
called
because
it
was
first
observed
in
the
year
when
the
hessian
troops
were
brought
over
and
was
popularly
supposed
to
have
been
accidentally
imported
by
those
unwelcome
strangers
other
destroyers
of
cereal
grains
have
since
found
their
way
across
the
atlantic
and
a
noxious
european
aphis
has
first
attacked
the
american
wheatfields
within
the
last
four
or
five
years
unhappily
in
these
cases
of
migration
the
natural
corrective
of
excessive
multiplication
the
parasitic
or
voracious
enemy
of
the
noxious
insect
does
not
always
accompany
the
wanderings
of
its
prey
and
the
bane
long
precedes
the
antidote
hence
in
the
united
states
the
ravages
of
imported
insects
injurious
to
cultivated
crops
not
being
checked
by
the
counteracting
influences
which
nature
had
provided
to
limit
their
devastations
in
the
old
world
are
much
more
destructive
than
in
europe
it
is
not
known
that
the
wheat
midge
is
preyed
upon
in
america
by
any
other
insect
and
in
seasons
favorable
to
it
it
multiplies
to
a
degree
which
would
prove
almost
fatal
to
the
entire
harvest
were
it
not
that
in
the
great
territorial
extent
of
the
united
states
there
is
room
for
such
differences
of
soil
and
climate
as
in
a
given
year
to
present
in
one
state
all
the
conditions
favorable
to
the
increase
of
a
particular
insect
while
in
another
the
natural
influences
are
hostile
to
it
the
only
apparent
remedy
for
this
evil
is
to
balance
the
disproportionate
development
of
noxious
foreign
species
by
bringing
from
their
native
country
the
tribes
which
prey
upon
them
this
it
seems
has
been
attempted
the
united
states
census
report
for
states
that
the
new
york
agricultural
society
has
introduced
into
this
country
from
abroad
certain
parasites
which
providence
has
created
to
counteract
the
destructive
powers
of
some
of
these
depredators
this
is
however
not
the
only
purpose
for
which
man
has
designedly
introduced
foreign
forms
of
insect
life
the
eggs
of
the
silkworm
are
known
to
have
been
brought
from
the
farther
east
to
europe
in
the
sixth
century
and
new
silk
spinners
which
feed
on
the
castor
oil
bean
and
the
ailanthus
have
recently
been
reared
in
france
and
in
south
america
with
promising
success
the
cochineal
long
regularly
bred
in
aboriginal
america
has
been
transplanted
to
spain
and
both
the
kermes
insect
and
the
cantharides
have
been
transferred
to
other
climates
than
their
own
the
honey
bee
must
be
ranked
next
to
the
silkworm
in
economical
importance
this
useful
creature
was
carried
to
the
united
states
by
european
colonists
in
the
latter
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
did
not
cross
the
mississippi
till
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
and
it
is
only
within
the
last
five
or
six
years
that
it
has
been
transported
to
california
where
it
was
previously
unknown
the
italian
stingless
bee
has
very
lately
been
introduced
into
the
united
states
the
insects
and
worms
intentionally
transplanted
by
man
bear
but
a
small
proportion
to
those
accidentally
introduced
by
him
plants
and
animals
often
carry
their
parasites
with
them
and
the
traffic
of
commercial
countries
which
exchange
their
products
with
every
zone
and
every
stage
of
social
existence
can
not
fail
to
transfer
in
both
directions
the
minute
organisms
that
are
in
one
way
or
another
associated
with
almost
every
object
important
to
the
material
interests
of
man
the
tenacity
of
life
possessed
by
many
insects
their
prodigious
fecundity
the
length
of
time
they
often
remain
in
the
different
phases
of
their
existence
the
security
of
the
retreats
into
which
their
small
dimensions
enable
them
to
retire
are
all
circumstances
very
favorable
not
only
to
the
perpetuity
of
their
species
but
to
their
transportation
to
distant
climates
and
their
multiplication
in
their
new
homes
the
teredo
so
destructive
to
shipping
has
been
carried
by
the
vessels
whose
wooden
walls
it
mines
to
almost
every
part
of
the
globe
the
termite
or
white
ant
is
said
to
have
been
brought
to
rochefort
by
the
commerce
of
that
port
a
hundred
years
ago
this
creature
is
more
injurious
to
wooden
structures
and
implements
than
any
other
known
insect
it
eats
out
almost
the
entire
substance
of
the
wood
leaving
only
thin
partitions
between
the
galleries
it
excavates
in
it
but
as
it
never
gnaws
through
the
surface
to
the
air
a
stick
of
timber
may
be
almost
wholly
consumed
without
showing
any
external
sign
of
the
damage
it
has
sustained
the
termite
is
found
also
in
other
parts
of
france
and
particularly
at
rochelle
where
thus
far
its
ravages
are
confined
to
a
single
quarter
of
the
city
a
borer
of
similar
habits
is
not
uncommon
in
italy
and
you
may
see
in
that
country
handsome
chairs
and
other
furniture
which
have
been
reduced
by
this
insect
to
a
framework
of
powder
of
post
covered
and
apparently
held
together
by
nothing
but
the
varnish
the
carnivorous
and
often
the
herbivorous
insects
render
an
important
service
to
man
by
consuming
dead
and
decaying
animal
and
vegetable
matter
the
decomposition
of
which
would
otherwise
fill
the
air
with
effluvia
noxious
to
health
some
of
them
the
beetle
for
instance
bury
the
small
animals
in
which
they
lay
their
eggs
and
thereby
prevent
the
escape
of
the
gases
disengaged
by
putrefaction
the
prodigious
rapidity
of
development
in
insect
life
the
great
numbers
of
the
individuals
in
many
species
and
the
voracity
of
most
of
them
while
in
the
larva
state
justify
the
appellation
of
nature
scavengers
which
has
been
bestowed
upon
them
and
there
is
very
little
doubt
that
in
warm
countries
they
consume
a
much
larger
quantity
of
putrescent
organic
material
than
the
quadrupeds
and
the
birds
which
feed
upon
such
aliment
of
it
is
well
known
to
naturalists
but
less
familiarly
to
common
observers
that
the
aquatic
larvæ
of
some
insects
constitute
at
certain
seasons
a
large
part
of
the
food
of
fish
while
other
larvæ
in
their
turn
prey
upon
the
spawn
and
even
the
young
of
their
persecutors
the
larvæ
of
the
mosquito
and
the
gnat
are
the
favorite
food
of
the
trout
in
the
wooded
regions
where
those
insects
abound
earlier
in
the
year
the
trout
feeds
on
the
larvæ
of
the
may
fly
which
is
itself
very
destructive
to
the
spawn
of
the
salmon
and
hence
by
a
sort
of
the
destruction
of
the
mosquito
that
feeds
the
trout
that
preys
on
the
may
fly
that
destroys
the
eggs
that
hatch
the
salmon
that
pampers
the
epicure
may
occasion
a
scarcity
of
this
latter
fish
in
waters
where
he
would
otherwise
be
abundant
thus
all
nature
is
linked
together
by
invisible
bonds
and
every
organic
creature
however
low
however
feeble
however
dependent
is
necessary
to
the
of
some
other
among
the
myriad
forms
of
life
with
which
the
creator
has
peopled
the
earth
i
have
said
that
man
has
promoted
the
increase
of
the
insect
and
the
worm
by
destroying
the
bird
and
the
fish
which
feed
upon
them
many
insects
in
the
four
different
stages
of
their
growth
inhabit
in
succession
the
earth
the
water
and
the
air
in
each
of
these
elements
they
have
their
special
enemies
and
deep
and
dark
as
are
the
minute
recesses
in
which
they
hide
themselves
they
are
pursued
to
the
remotest
obscurest
corners
by
the
executioners
that
nature
has
appointed
to
punish
their
delinquencies
and
furnished
with
cunning
contrivances
for
ferreting
out
the
offenders
and
dragging
them
into
the
light
of
day
one
tribe
of
birds
the
woodpeckers
seems
to
depend
for
subsistence
almost
wholly
on
those
insects
which
breed
in
dead
or
dying
trees
and
it
is
perhaps
needless
to
say
that
the
injury
these
birds
do
the
forest
is
imaginary
they
do
not
cut
holes
in
the
trunk
of
the
tree
to
prepare
a
lodgment
for
a
future
colony
of
boring
larvæ
but
to
extract
the
worm
which
has
already
begun
his
mining
labors
hence
these
birds
are
not
found
where
the
forester
removes
trees
as
fast
as
they
become
fit
habitations
for
such
insects
in
clearing
new
lands
in
the
united
states
dead
trees
especially
of
the
kinds
too
much
decayed
to
serve
for
timber
and
which
in
that
state
are
worth
little
for
fuel
are
often
allowed
to
stand
until
they
fall
of
themselves
such
as
they
are
popularly
called
are
filled
with
borers
and
often
deeply
cut
by
the
woodpeckers
whose
strong
bills
enable
them
to
penetrate
to
the
very
heart
of
the
tree
and
drag
out
the
lurking
larvæ
after
a
few
years
the
stubs
fall
or
as
wood
becomes
valuable
are
cut
and
carried
off
for
firewood
and
at
the
same
time
the
farmer
selects
for
felling
in
the
forest
he
has
reserved
as
a
permanent
source
of
supply
of
fuel
and
timber
the
decaying
trees
which
like
the
dead
stems
in
the
fields
serve
as
a
home
for
both
the
worm
and
his
pursuer
we
thus
gradually
extirpate
this
tribe
of
insects
and
with
them
the
species
of
birds
which
subsist
principally
upon
them
thus
the
fine
large
woodpecker
formerly
very
common
in
new
england
has
almost
entirely
disappeared
from
those
states
since
the
dead
trees
are
gone
and
the
apples
his
favorite
vegetable
food
are
less
abundant
there
are
even
large
quadrupeds
which
feed
almost
exclusively
upon
insects
the
ant
bear
is
strong
enough
to
pull
down
the
clay
houses
built
by
the
species
of
termites
that
constitute
his
ordinary
diet
and
the
curious
a
climbing
quadruped
of
madagascar
of
which
i
believe
only
a
single
specimen
secured
by
sandwith
has
yet
reached
europe
is
provided
with
a
very
slender
finger
long
enough
to
reach
far
into
a
hole
in
the
trunk
of
a
tree
and
extract
the
worm
which
bored
it
but
perhaps
the
most
formidable
foes
of
the
insect
and
even
of
the
small
rodents
are
the
reptiles
the
chameleon
approaches
the
insect
perched
upon
the
twig
of
a
tree
with
an
almost
imperceptible
slowness
of
motion
until
at
the
distance
of
a
foot
he
shoots
out
his
long
slimy
tongue
and
rarely
fails
to
secure
the
victim
even
the
slow
toad
catches
the
swift
and
wary
housefly
in
the
same
manner
and
in
the
warm
countries
of
europe
the
numerous
lizards
contribute
very
essentially
to
the
reduction
of
the
insect
population
which
they
both
surprise
in
the
winged
state
upon
walls
and
trees
and
consume
as
egg
worm
and
chrysalis
in
their
earlier
metamorphoses
the
serpents
feed
much
upon
insects
as
well
as
upon
mice
moles
and
small
reptiles
including
also
other
snakes
the
disgust
and
fear
with
which
the
serpent
is
so
universally
regarded
expose
him
to
constant
persecution
by
man
and
perhaps
no
other
animal
is
so
relentlessly
sacrificed
by
him
in
temperate
climates
snakes
are
consumed
by
scarcely
any
beast
or
bird
of
prey
except
the
stork
and
they
have
few
dangerous
enemies
but
man
though
in
the
tropics
other
animals
prey
upon
them
it
is
doubtful
whether
any
species
of
serpent
has
been
exterminated
within
the
human
period
and
even
the
dense
population
of
china
has
not
been
able
completely
to
rid
itself
of
the
viper
they
have
however
almost
entirely
disappeared
from
particular
localities
the
rattlesnake
is
now
wholly
unknown
in
many
large
districts
where
it
was
extremely
common
half
a
century
ago
and
palestine
has
long
been
if
not
absolutely
free
from
venomous
serpents
at
least
very
nearly
so
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
waters
seem
comparatively
secure
from
human
pursuit
or
interference
by
the
inaccessibility
of
their
retreats
and
by
our
ignorance
of
their
habits
a
natural
result
of
the
difficulty
of
observing
the
ways
of
creatures
living
in
a
medium
in
which
we
can
not
exist
human
agency
has
nevertheless
both
directly
and
incidentally
produced
great
changes
in
the
population
of
the
sea
the
lakes
and
the
rivers
and
if
the
effects
of
such
revolutions
in
aquatic
life
are
apparently
of
small
importance
in
general
geography
they
are
still
not
wholly
inappreciable
the
great
diminution
in
the
abundance
of
the
larger
fish
employed
for
food
or
pursued
for
products
useful
in
the
arts
is
familiar
and
when
we
consider
how
the
vegetable
and
animal
life
on
which
they
feed
must
be
affected
by
the
reduction
of
their
numbers
it
is
easy
to
see
that
their
destruction
may
involve
considerable
modifications
in
many
of
the
material
arrangements
of
nature
the
whale
does
not
appear
to
have
been
an
object
of
pursuit
by
the
ancients
for
any
purpose
nor
do
we
know
when
the
whale
fishery
first
commenced
it
was
however
very
actively
prosecuted
in
the
middle
ages
and
the
biscayans
seem
to
have
been
particularly
successful
in
this
as
indeed
in
other
branches
of
nautical
industry
five
hundred
years
ago
whales
abounded
in
every
sea
they
long
since
became
so
rare
in
the
mediterranean
as
not
to
afford
encouragement
for
the
fishery
as
a
regular
occupation
and
the
great
demand
for
oil
and
whalebone
for
mechanical
and
manufacturing
purposes
in
the
present
century
has
stimulated
the
pursuit
of
the
hugest
of
living
creatures
to
such
activity
that
he
has
now
almost
wholly
disappeared
from
many
favorite
fishing
grounds
and
in
others
is
greatly
diminished
in
numbers
what
special
functions
besides
his
uses
to
man
are
assigned
to
the
whale
in
the
economy
of
nature
we
do
not
know
but
some
considerations
suggested
by
the
character
of
the
food
upon
which
certain
species
subsist
deserve
to
be
specially
noticed
none
of
the
great
mammals
grouped
under
the
general
name
of
whale
are
rapacious
they
all
live
upon
small
organisms
and
the
most
numerous
species
feed
almost
wholly
upon
the
soft
gelatinous
mollusks
in
which
the
sea
abounds
in
all
latitudes
we
can
not
calculate
even
approximately
the
number
of
the
whales
or
the
quantity
of
organic
nutriment
consumed
by
an
individual
and
of
course
we
can
form
no
estimate
of
the
total
amount
of
animal
matter
withdrawn
by
them
in
a
given
period
from
the
waters
of
the
sea
it
is
certain
however
that
it
must
have
been
enormous
when
they
were
more
abundant
and
that
it
is
still
very
considerable
a
very
few
years
since
the
united
states
had
more
than
six
hundred
whaling
ships
constantly
employed
in
the
pacific
and
the
product
of
the
american
whale
fishery
for
the
year
ending
june
was
seven
millions
and
a
half
of
dollars
the
mere
bulk
of
the
whales
destroyed
in
a
single
year
by
the
american
and
the
european
vessels
engaged
in
this
fishery
would
form
an
island
of
no
inconsiderable
dimensions
and
each
one
of
those
taken
must
have
consumed
in
the
course
of
his
growth
many
times
his
own
weight
of
mollusks
the
destruction
of
the
whales
must
have
been
followed
by
a
proportional
increase
of
the
organisms
they
feed
upon
and
if
we
had
the
means
of
comparing
the
statistics
of
these
humble
forms
of
life
for
even
so
short
a
period
as
that
between
the
years
and
we
should
find
a
difference
sufficient
possibly
to
suggest
an
explanation
of
some
phenomena
at
present
unaccounted
for
for
instance
as
i
have
observed
in
another
work
the
phosphorescence
of
the
sea
was
unknown
to
ancient
writers
or
at
least
scarcely
noticed
by
them
and
even
homer
who
blind
as
tradition
makes
him
when
he
composed
his
epics
had
seen
and
marked
in
earlier
life
all
that
the
glorious
nature
of
the
mediterranean
and
its
coasts
discloses
to
unscientific
observation
nowhere
alludes
to
this
most
beautiful
and
striking
of
maritime
wonders
in
the
passage
just
referred
to
i
have
endeavored
to
explain
the
silence
of
ancient
writers
with
respect
to
this
as
well
as
other
remarkable
phenomena
on
psychological
grounds
but
is
it
not
possible
that
in
modern
times
the
animalculæ
which
produce
it
may
have
immensely
multiplied
from
the
destruction
of
their
natural
enemies
by
man
and
hence
that
the
gleam
shot
forth
by
their
decomposition
or
by
their
living
processes
is
both
more
frequent
and
more
brilliant
than
in
the
days
of
classic
antiquity
although
the
whale
does
not
prey
upon
smaller
creatures
resembling
himself
in
form
and
habits
yet
true
fishes
are
extremely
voracious
and
almost
every
tribe
devours
unsparingly
the
feebler
species
and
even
the
spawn
and
young
of
its
own
the
enormous
destruction
of
the
pike
the
trout
family
and
other
ravenous
fish
as
well
as
of
the
fishing
birds
the
seal
and
the
otter
by
man
would
naturally
have
occasioned
a
great
increase
in
the
weaker
and
more
defenceless
fish
on
which
they
feed
had
he
not
been
as
hostile
to
them
also
as
to
their
persecutors
we
have
little
evidence
that
any
fish
employed
as
human
food
has
naturally
multiplied
in
modern
times
while
all
the
more
valuable
tribes
have
been
immensely
reduced
in
numbers
this
reduction
must
have
affected
the
more
voracious
species
not
used
as
food
by
man
and
accordingly
the
shark
and
other
fish
of
similar
habits
though
not
objects
of
systematic
pursuit
are
now
comparatively
rare
in
many
waters
where
they
formerly
abounded
the
result
is
that
man
has
greatly
reduced
the
numbers
of
all
larger
marine
animals
and
consequently
indirectly
favored
the
multiplication
of
the
smaller
aquatic
organisms
which
entered
into
their
nutriment
this
change
in
the
relations
of
the
organic
and
inorganic
matter
of
the
sea
must
have
exercised
an
influence
on
the
latter
what
that
influence
has
been
we
can
not
say
still
less
can
we
predict
what
it
will
be
hereafter
but
its
action
is
not
for
that
reason
the
less
certain
and
breeding
of
the
introduction
and
successful
breeding
of
fish
of
foreign
species
appears
to
have
been
long
practised
in
china
and
was
not
unknown
to
the
greeks
and
romans
this
art
has
been
revived
in
modern
times
but
thus
far
without
any
important
results
economical
or
physical
though
there
seems
to
be
good
reason
to
believe
it
may
be
employed
with
advantage
on
an
extended
scale
as
in
the
case
of
plants
man
has
sometimes
undesignedly
introduced
new
species
of
aquatic
animals
into
countries
distant
from
their
birthplace
the
accidental
escape
of
the
chinese
goldfish
from
ponds
where
they
were
bred
as
a
garden
ornament
has
peopled
some
european
and
it
is
said
american
streams
with
this
species
canals
of
navigation
and
irrigation
interchange
the
fish
of
lakes
and
rivers
widely
separated
by
natural
barriers
as
well
as
the
plants
which
drop
their
seeds
into
the
waters
the
erie
canal
as
measured
by
its
own
channel
has
a
length
of
about
three
hundred
and
sixty
miles
and
it
has
ascending
and
descending
locks
in
both
directions
by
this
route
the
fish
of
the
hudson
and
the
upper
lakes
and
some
of
the
indigenous
vegetables
of
these
respective
basins
have
intermixed
and
the
fauna
and
flora
of
the
two
regions
have
now
more
species
common
to
both
than
before
the
canal
was
opened
some
accidental
attraction
not
unfrequently
induces
fish
to
follow
a
vessel
for
days
in
succession
and
they
may
thus
be
enticed
into
zones
very
distant
from
their
native
habitat
several
years
ago
i
was
told
at
constantinople
upon
good
authority
that
a
couple
of
fish
of
a
species
wholly
unknown
to
the
natives
had
just
been
taken
in
the
bosphorus
they
were
alleged
to
have
followed
an
english
ship
from
the
thames
and
to
have
been
frequently
observed
by
the
crew
during
the
passage
but
i
was
unable
to
learn
their
specific
character
many
of
the
fish
which
pass
the
greater
part
of
the
year
in
salt
water
spawn
in
fresh
and
some
species
the
common
brook
trout
of
new
england
for
instance
which
under
ordinary
circumstances
never
visit
the
sea
will
if
transferred
to
brooks
emptying
directly
into
the
ocean
go
down
into
the
salt
water
after
spawning
time
and
return
again
the
next
season
sea
fish
the
smelt
among
others
are
said
to
have
been
naturalized
in
fresh
water
and
some
naturalists
have
argued
from
the
character
of
the
fish
of
lake
baikal
and
especially
from
the
existence
of
the
seal
in
that
locality
that
all
its
inhabitants
were
originally
marine
species
and
have
changed
their
habits
with
the
gradual
conversion
of
the
saline
waters
of
the
lake
once
as
is
assumed
a
maritime
bay
into
fresh
the
presence
of
the
seal
is
hardly
conclusive
on
this
point
for
it
is
sometimes
seen
in
lake
champlain
at
the
distance
of
some
hundreds
of
miles
from
even
brackish
water
one
of
these
animals
was
killed
on
the
ice
in
that
lake
in
february
another
in
february
and
remains
of
the
seal
have
been
found
at
other
times
in
the
same
waters
the
remains
of
the
higher
orders
of
aquatic
animals
are
generally
so
perishable
that
even
where
most
abundant
they
do
not
appear
to
be
now
forming
permanent
deposits
of
any
considerable
magnitude
but
it
is
quite
otherwise
with
shell
fish
and
as
we
shall
see
hereafter
with
many
of
the
minute
limeworkers
of
the
sea
there
are
on
the
southern
coast
of
the
united
states
beds
of
shells
so
extensive
that
they
were
formerly
supposed
to
have
been
naturally
accumulated
and
were
appealed
to
as
proofs
of
an
elevation
of
the
coast
by
geological
causes
but
they
are
now
ascertained
to
have
been
derived
from
oysters
consumed
in
the
course
of
long
ages
by
the
inhabitants
of
indian
towns
the
planting
of
a
bed
of
oysters
in
a
new
locality
might
very
probably
lead
in
time
to
the
formation
of
a
bank
which
in
connection
with
other
deposits
might
perceptibly
affect
the
line
of
a
coast
or
by
changing
the
course
of
marine
currents
or
the
outlet
of
a
river
produce
geographical
changes
of
no
small
importance
the
transplantation
of
oysters
to
artificial
ponds
has
long
been
common
and
it
appears
to
have
recently
succeeded
well
on
a
large
scale
in
the
open
sea
on
the
french
coast
a
great
extension
of
this
fishery
is
hoped
for
and
it
is
now
proposed
to
introduce
upon
the
same
coast
the
american
soft
clam
which
is
so
abundant
in
the
beach
sands
of
long
island
sound
as
to
form
an
important
article
in
the
diet
of
the
neighboring
population
the
intentional
naturalization
of
foreign
fish
as
i
have
said
has
not
thus
far
yielded
important
fruits
but
though
this
particular
branch
of
what
is
called
not
very
happily
has
not
yet
established
its
claims
to
the
attention
of
the
physical
geographer
or
the
political
economist
the
artificial
breeding
of
domestic
fish
has
already
produced
very
valuable
results
and
is
apparently
destined
to
occupy
an
extremely
conspicuous
place
in
the
history
of
man
efforts
to
compensate
his
prodigal
waste
of
the
gifts
of
nature
the
restoration
of
the
primitive
abundance
of
salt
and
fresh
water
fish
is
one
of
the
greatest
material
benefits
that
with
our
present
physical
resources
governments
can
hope
to
confer
upon
their
subjects
the
rivers
lakes
and
seacoasts
once
restocked
and
protected
by
law
from
exhaustion
by
taking
fish
at
improper
seasons
by
destructive
methods
and
in
extravagant
quantities
would
continue
indefinitely
to
furnish
a
very
large
supply
of
most
healthful
food
which
unlike
all
domestic
and
agricultural
products
would
spontaneously
renew
itself
and
cost
nothing
but
the
taking
there
are
many
sterile
or
wornout
soils
in
europe
so
situated
that
they
might
at
no
very
formidable
cost
be
converted
into
permanent
lakes
which
would
serve
not
only
as
reservoirs
to
retain
the
water
of
winter
rains
and
snow
and
give
it
out
in
the
dry
season
for
irrigation
but
as
breeding
ponds
for
fish
and
would
thus
without
further
cost
yield
a
larger
supply
of
human
food
than
can
at
present
be
obtained
from
them
even
at
a
great
expenditure
of
capital
and
labor
in
agricultural
operations
the
additions
which
might
be
made
to
the
nutriment
of
the
civilized
world
by
a
judicious
administration
of
the
resources
of
the
waters
would
allow
some
restriction
of
the
amount
of
soil
at
present
employed
for
agricultural
purposes
and
a
corresponding
extension
of
the
area
of
the
forest
and
would
thus
facilitate
a
return
to
primitive
geographical
arrangements
which
it
is
important
partially
to
restore
of
aquatic
it
does
not
seem
probable
that
man
with
all
his
rapacity
and
all
his
enginery
will
succeed
in
totally
extirpating
any
fish
but
he
has
already
exterminated
at
least
one
marine
animal
steller
sea
cow
and
the
walrus
the
sea
lion
and
other
large
amphibia
as
well
as
the
principal
fishing
quadrupeds
are
in
imminent
danger
of
extinction
steller
sea
cow
was
first
seen
by
europeans
in
the
year
on
bering
island
it
was
a
huge
amphibious
mammal
weighing
not
less
than
eight
thousand
pounds
and
appears
to
have
been
confined
exclusively
to
the
islands
and
coasts
in
the
neighborhood
of
bering
strait
its
flesh
was
very
palatable
and
the
localities
it
frequented
were
easily
accessible
from
the
russian
establishments
in
kamtschatka
as
soon
as
its
existence
and
character
and
the
abundance
of
fur
animals
in
the
same
waters
were
made
known
to
the
occupants
of
those
posts
by
the
return
of
the
survivors
of
expedition
so
active
a
chase
was
commenced
against
the
amphibia
of
that
region
that
in
the
course
of
years
the
sea
cow
described
by
steller
as
extremely
numerous
in
is
believed
to
have
been
completely
extirpated
not
a
single
individual
having
been
seen
since
the
year
the
various
tribes
of
seals
in
the
northern
and
southern
pacific
the
walrus
and
the
sea
otter
are
already
so
reduced
in
numbers
that
they
seem
destined
soon
to
follow
the
sea
cow
unless
protected
by
legislation
stringent
enough
and
a
police
energetic
enough
to
repress
the
ardent
cupidity
of
their
pursuers
the
seals
the
otter
tribe
and
many
other
amphibia
which
feed
almost
exclusively
upon
fish
are
extremely
voracious
and
of
course
their
destruction
or
numerical
reduction
must
have
favored
the
multiplication
of
the
species
of

preyed
upon

them
i
have
been
assured
by
the
keeper
of
several
tamed
seals
that
if
supplied
at
frequent
intervals
each
seal
would
devour
not
less
than
fourteen
pounds
of
fish
or
about
a
quarter
of
his
own
weight

a
day

very
intelligent

passed
a

promoted
the

organized

to
involve
the

a

upon

its

its

is
at

recognized
by
those
who
deal
in

no

can
give
the

fattened
by

selected
and
prepared
by

the
flavor
of
those
which
are
nourished
at
the
table
of

and
the

of
the
artificial

in
germany
and
switzerland
are
so
inferior
to
the
brook
fish
of
the
same
species
and
climate
that
it
is
hard
to
believe
them
identical
the
superior
sapidity
of
the
american
trout
to
the
european
species
which
is
familiar
to
every
one
acquainted
with

continents
is
probably
due
less
to
specific
difference
than
to
the
fact
that
even
in
the
parts
of
the

which
have
been
longest
cultivated
wild
nature
is
not
yet
tamed
down
to
the
character
it
has
assumed
in
the
old
and
which
it
will
acquire
in
america
also
when
her
civilization
shall
be
as
ancient
as
is
now
that
of
europe
man
has
hitherto
hardly
anywhere
produced
such
climatic
or
other
changes
as
would
suffice
of
themselves
totally
to
banish
the
wild
inhabitants
of
the
dry
land
and
the
disappearance
of
the
native
birds
and
quadrupeds
from
particular
localities
is
to
be
ascribed
quite
as
much
to
his
direct
persecutions
as
to
the
want
of
forest
shelter
of
appropriate
food
or
of
other
conditions
indispensable
to
their
existence
but
almost
all
the
processes
of
agriculture
and
of
mechanical
and
chemical
industry
are
fatally
destructive
to
aquatic
animals
within
reach
of
their
influence
when
in
consequence
of
clearing
the
woods
the
changes
already
described
as
thereby
produced

the
smaller
organisms
which
formed
the
sustenance
of

disappear
or
are
reduced
in
numbers
and
new
enemies
are
added
to
the
old
foes
that
preyed
upon
them
the
increased
turbidness
of
the
water
in
the
annual
inundations
chokes
the
fish
and
finally
the
quickened
velocity
of
its
current
sweeps
them
down
into
the
larger
rivers
or
into
the
sea
before
they
are

strong

to
support
so
great
a

are
the
work
of
the
humble
organisms
of
which
i
speak
often
indeed
of
animalculæ
so
small
as
to
become
visible
only
by
the

of

magnifying
a

times

is
popularly
supposed
that
animalculæ
or
what
are
commonly
embraced
under
the
vague
name
of
infusoria
inhabit
the
water
alone
but
the
atmospheric
dust
transported
by
every
wind
and
deposited
by
every
calm
is
full
of
microscopic
life
or
of
its
relics
the
soil
on
which
the
city
of
berlin
stands
contains
at
the
depth
of
ten
or
fifteen
feet
below
the
surface
living
elaborators
of
silex
and
a
microscopic
examination
of
a
handful
of
earth
connected
with
the
material
evidences
of
guilt
has
enabled
the
naturalist
to
point
out
the
very
spot
where
a
crime
was
committed
it
has
been
computed
that
one
sixth
part
of
the
solid
matter
let
fall
by
great
rivers
at
their
outlets
consists
of
still
recognizable
infusory
shells
and
shields
and
as
the
friction
of
rolling
water
must
reduce
much
of
these
fragile
structures
to
a
state
of
comminution
which
even
the
microscope
can
not
resolve
into
distinct
particles
and
identify
as
relics
of
animal
or
of
vegetable
life
we
must
conclude
that
a
considerably
larger
proportion
of
river
deposits
is
really
the
product
of
animalcules
it
is
evident
that
the
chemical
and
in
many
cases
the
mechanical
character
of
a
great
number
of
the
objects
important
in
the
material
economy
of
human
life
must
be
affected
by
the
presence
of
so
large
an
organic
element
in
their
substance
and
it
is
equally
obvious
that
all
agricultural
and
all
industrial
operations
tend
to
disturb
the
natural
arrangements
of
this
element
to
increase
or
to
diminish
the
special
adaptation
of
every
medium
in
which
it
lives

the
particular
orders

the
conversion
of

of

into

of

or
of

into

the
rotations
of
cultivated
crops
must
prove
fatal
to
millions
of
living
things
upon
every
rood
of
surface
thus
deranged
by
man
and
must
at
the
same
time
more
or
less
fully
compensate
this
destruction
of
life
by
promoting
the
growth
and
multiplication
of
other
tribes

minute

i
do
not
know
that
man
has
yet
endeavored
to
avail
himself
by
artificial
contrivances
of
the
agency
of
these
wonderful
architects
and
manufacturers
we
are
hardly
well
enough
acquainted
with
their
natural
economy
to
devise
means
to
turn
their
industry
to
profitable
account
and
they
are
in
very
many
cases
too
slow
in
producing
visible
results
for
an
age
so
impatient
as
ours
the
of
the
nineteenth
century
can
not
wait
for
wealth
to
be
amassed
by
infinitesimal
gains
and
we
are
in
haste
to
upon
the
powers
of
nature
as
we
do
upon
objects
of
bargain
and
sale
in
our
trafficking
one
with
another
but
there
are
still
some
cases
where
the
little
we
know
of
a
life
whose
workings
are
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
suggests
the
possibility
of
advantageously
directing
the
efforts
of
troops
of
artisans
that
we
can
not
see
upon
coasts
occupied
by
the
corallines
the
animalcule
does
not
work
near
the
mouth
of
rivers
hence
the
change
of
the
outlet
of
a
stream
often
a
very
easy
matter
may
promote
the
construction
of
a
barrier
to
coast
navigation
at
one
point
and
check
the
formation
of
a
reef
at
another
by
diverting
a
current
of
fresh
water
from
the
former
and
pouring
it
into
the
sea
at
the
latter
cases
may
probably
be
found
in
tropical
seas
where
rivers
have
prevented
the
working
of
the
coral
animalcules
in
straits
separating
islands
from
each
other
or
from
the
mainland
the
diversion
of
such
streams
might
remove
this
obstacle
and
reefs
consequently
be
formed
which
should
convert
an
archipelago
into
a
single
large
island
and
finally
join
that
to
the
neighboring
continent
quatrefages

to

perhaps
the

of
the
coralline
animals
might
be
arrested
over
a
considerable
extent
of
sea
coast
by
similar
means
the
reef
builders
are
leisurely
architects

the
precious
coral
is
formed
so
rapidly
that
the
beds
may
be
refished
advantageously
as
often
as
once
in
ten
years
it
does
not
seem
impossible
that
this
coral
might
be
transplanted
to
the
american
coast
where
the
gulf
stream
would
furnish
a
suitable
temperature
beyond
the
climatic
limits
that
otherwise
confine
its
growth
and
thus
a
new
source
of

might
perhaps
be
added
to
the
scanty
returns
of
the
hardy

certain
geological

of

and
of

and
ultimately
doubtless
in
many
yet
undiscovered
industrial
processes
an
attentive
study
of
the
conditions
favorable
to
the
propagation
of
the
diatomaceæ
might
perhaps
help
us
to
profit
directly
by
the
productivity
of
this
organism

at
the
same
time
disclose

of
being
turned

our
acquaintance
with
the
obscure
and

of
which
i
have
now
been
treating
is
very
recent
and
still
very
imperfect
we
know
that
it
is
of
vast
importance
in
the
economy
of
nature
but
we
are
so
ambitious
to
grasp
the
great
so
little
accustomed
to
occupy
ourselves
with
the
minute
that
we
are
not
yet
prepared
to
enter
seriously
upon
the
question
how
far
we
can
control
and
direct
the
operations
not
of
unembodied
physical
forces

of
beings
in
popular
apprehension
almost
as
immaterial
as

nature

no
unit
of

by
which

measures

works
man
takes
his
standards
of

from
himself
the
hair

was
his
minimum

told
him
that
there
are
animated

to
which
one
of

borrows
his

from
the

the
spread
of
his

of
the

so
named
his
cubit
is
the
distance
from
the

of
his

to
his

and
his

is
the

he
can
measure
with
his
outstretched

to
a
being
who
instinctively
finds
the
standard
of
all
magnitudes
in
his
own
material
frame
all
objects
exceeding
his
own
dimensions
are
absolutely
great
all
falling
short
of
them
absolutely
small
hence
we
habitually
regard
the
whale
and
the
elephant
as
essentially
large
and
therefore
important
creatures
the
animalcule
as
an
essentially
small
and
therefore
unimportant
organism
but
no
geological
formation
owes
its
origin
to
the
labors
or
the
remains
of
the
huge
mammal
while
the

composes
or

furnished
the

of

thousands
of
feet
in

and

over

to
put

of
forests
by
lightning
must
have
first
suggested
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
the
removal
of
too
abundant
and
extensive
woods
and
at
the
same
time
have
pointed
out
a
means
by
which
a
large
tract
of
surface
could
readily
be
cleared
of
much
of
this
natural
incumbrance
as
soon
as
agriculture
had
commenced
at
all
it
would
be
observed
that
the
growth
of
cultivated
plants
as
well
as
of
many
species
of
wild
vegetation
was
particularly
rapid
and
luxuriant
on
soils
which
had
been
burned
over
and
thus
a
new
stimulus
would
be
given
to
the
practice
of
destroying
the
woods
by
fire
as
a
means
of
both
extending
the
open
grounds
and
making
the
acquisition
of
a
yet
more
productive
soil
after
a
few
harvests
had
exhausted
the
first
rank
fertility
of
the
virgin
mould
or
when
weeds
and
briers
and
the
sprouting
roots
of
the
trees
had
begun
to
choke
the
crops
of
the
soil
the
ground
would
be
abandoned
for
new
fields
won
from
the
forest
by
the
same
means
and
the
deserted
plain
or
hillock
would
soon
clothe
itself
anew
with
shrubs
and
trees
to
be
again
subjected
to
the
same
destructive
process
and
again
surrendered
to
the
restorative
powers
of
vegetable
nature
this
rude
economy
would
be
continued
for
generations
and
wasteful
as
it
is
is
still
largely
pursued
in
northern
sweden
swedish
lapland
and
sometimes
even
in
france
and
the
united
states
of
fire
on

aside
from
the
mechanical
and
chemical
effects
of
the
disturbance
of
the
soil
by
agricultural
operations
and
of
the
freer
admission
of
sun
rain
and
air
to
the
ground
the
fire
of
itself
exerts
an
important
influence
on
its
texture
and
condition
it
consumes
a
portion
of
the
vegetable
mould
which
served
to
hold
its
mineral
particles
together
and
to
retain
the
water
of
precipitation
and
thus
loosens
pulverizes
and
dries
the
earth
it
destroys
reptiles
insects
and
worms
with
their
eggs
and
the
seeds
of
trees
and
of
smaller
plants
it
supplies
in
the
ashes
which
it
deposits
on
the
surface
important
elements
for
the
growth
of
a
new
forest
clothing
as
well
as
of
the
usual
objects
of
agricultural
industry
and
by
the
changes
thus
produced
it
fits
the
ground
for
the
reception
of
a
vegetation
different
in
character
from
that
which
had
spontaneously
covered
it
these
new
conditions
help
to
explain
the
natural
succession
of
forest
crops
so
generally
observed
in
all
woods
cleared
by
fire
and
then
abandoned
there
is
no
doubt
however
that
other
influences
contribute
to
the
same
result
because
effects
more
or
less
analogous
follow
when
the
trees
are
destroyed
by
other
causes
as
by
high
winds
by
the
woodman
axe
and
even
by
natural
decay
of
destruction
of
the
the
effects
of
the
destruction
of
the
forests
may
be
divided
into
two
great
classes
each
having
an
important
influence
on
vegetable
and
on
animal
life
in
all
their
manifestations
as
well
as
on
every
branch
of
rural
economy
and
productive
industry
and
therefore
on
all
the
material
interests
of
man
the
first
respects
the
meteorology
of
the
countries
exposed
to
the
action
of
these
influences
the
second

or
in
other
words

and

of

for
reasons
assigned
in
the
first
chapter
the
meteorological
or
climatic
branch
of
the
subject
is
the
most
obscure
and
the
conclusions
of
physicists
respecting
it
are
in
a
great
degree
inferential
only
not
founded
on
experiment
or
direct
observation
they
are
as
might
be
expected
somewhat
discordant
though
certain
general
results
are
almost
universally
accepted
and
seem
indeed
too
well
supported
to
admit
of
serious
question
influence
of
the
properties
of
trees
singly
and
in
groups
as
exciters
or
conductors
of
electricity
and
their
consequent
influence
upon
the
electrical
state
of
the
atmosphere
do
not
appear
to
have
been
much
investigated
and
the
conditions
of
the
forest
itself
are
so
variable
and
so
complicated
that
the
solution
of
any
general
problem
respecting
its
electrical
influence
would
be
a
matter
of
extreme
difficulty
it
is
indeed
impossible
to
suppose
that
a
dense
cloud
a
sea
of
vapor
can
pass
over
miles
of
surface
bristling
with
good
conductors
without
undergoing
some
change
of
electrical
condition
hypothetical
cases
may
be
put
in
which
the
character
of
the
change
could
be
deduced
from
the
known
laws
of
electrical
action
but
in
actual
nature
the
elements
are
too
numerous
for
us
to
seize
the
true
electrical
condition
of
neither
cloud
nor
forest
could
be
known
and
it
could
seldom
be
predicted
whether
the
vapors
would
be
dissolved
as
they
floated
over
the
wood
or
discharged
upon
it
in
a
deluge
of
rain
with
regard
to
possible
electrical
influences
of
the
forest
wider
still
in
their
range
of
action
the
uncertainty
is
even
greater
the
data
which
alone
could
lead
to
certain
or
even
probable
conclusions
are
wanting
and
we
should
therefore
only
embarrass
our
argument
by
any
attempt
to
discuss
this
meteorological
element
important
as
it
may
be
in
its
relations
of
cause
and
effect
to
more
familiar
and
better
understood
meteoric
phenomena
it
may
however
be
observed
that
hail
storms
which
were
once
generally
supposed
and
are
still
held
by
many
to
be
produced
by
a
specific
electrical
action
and
which
at
least
are
always
accompanied
by
electrical
disturbances
are
believed
in
all
countries
particularly
exposed
to
that
scourge
to
have
become
more
frequent
and
destructive
in
proportion
as
the
forests
have
been
cleared
caimi
observes
when
the
chains
of
the
alps
and
the
apennines
had
not
yet
been
stripped
of
their
magnificent
crown
of
woods
the
may
hail
which
now
desolates
the
fertile
plains
of
lombardy
was
much
less
frequent
but
since
the
general
prostration
of
the
forest
these
tempests
are
laying
waste
even
the
mountain
soils
whose
older
inhabitants
scarcely
knew
this
plague
the
which
the
learned
curate
of
rivolta
advised
to
erect
with
sheaves
of
straw

up
vertically
over

great
extent

a
liliputian
image
of
the
vast

which
nature
had
planted
by
millions
on
the
crests
and
ridges
of
the
alps
and
the
apennines
electrical
action
being
diminished
says
meguscher
and
the
rapid
congelation
of
vapors
by
the
abstraction
of
heat
being
impeded
by
the
influence
of
the
woods
it
is
rare
that
hail
or
waterspouts
are
produced
within
the
precincts
of
a
large
forest
when
it
is
assailed
by
the
tempest
arthur
young
was
told
that
since
the
forests
which
covered
the
mountains
between
the
riviera
and
the
county
of
montferrat
had
disappeared
hail
had
become
more
destructive
in
the
district
of
acqui
and
it
appears
upon
good
authority
that
a
similar
increase
in
the
frequency
and
violence
of
hail
storms
in
the
neighborhood
of
saluzzo
and
mondovì
the
lower
part
of
the
valtelline
and
the
territory
of
verona
and
vicenza
is
probably
to
be
ascribed
to
a
similar
cause
influence
of
the
we
know
that
the
air
in
a
close
apartment
is
appreciably
affected
through
the
inspiration
and
expiration
of
gases
by
plants
growing
in
it
the
same
operations
are
performed
on
a
gigantic
scale
by
the
forest
and
it
has
even
been
supposed
that
the
absorption
of
carbon
by
the
rank
vegetation
of
earlier
geological
periods
occasioned
a
permanent
change
in
the
constitution
of
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
to
the
effects
thus
produced
are
to
be
added
those
of
the
ultimate
gaseous
decomposition
of
the
vast
vegetable
mass
annually
shed
by
trees
and
of
their
trunks
and
branches
when
they
fall
a
prey
to
time
but
the
quantity
of
gases
thus
abstracted
from
and
restored
to
the
atmosphere
is
inconsiderable
infinitesimal
one
might
almost
say
in
comparison
with
the
ocean
of
air
from
which
they
are
drawn
and
to
which
they
return
and
though
the
exhalations
from
bogs
and
other
low
grounds
covered
with
decaying
vegetable
matter
are
highly
deleterious
to
human
health
yet
in
general
the
air
of
the
forest
is
hardly
chemically
distinguishable
from
that
of
the
sand
plains
and
we
can
as
little
trace
the
influence
of
the
woods
in
the
analysis
of
the
atmosphere
as
we
can
prove
that
the
mineral
ingredients
of
land
springs
sensibly
affect
the
chemistry
of
the
sea
i
may
then
properly
dismiss
the
chemical
as
i
have
done
the
electrical
influences
of
the
forest
and
treat
them
both
alike
if
not
as
unimportant
agencies
at
least
as
quantities
of
unknown
value
in
our
meteorological
equation
our
inquiries
upon
this
branch
of
the
subject
will
accordingly
be
limited
to
the
thermometrical
and
hygrometrical
influences
of
the
woods
of
the
forest
considered
as
inorganic
matter
on
the
evaporation
of
fluids
and
the
condensation
and
expansion
of
vapors
and
gases
are
attended
with
changes
of
temperature
and
the
quantity
of
moisture
which
the
air
is
capable
of
containing
and
of
course
the
evaporation
rise
and
fall
with
the
thermometer
the
hygroscopical
and
the
thermoscopical
conditions
of
the
atmosphere
are
therefore
inseparably
connected
as
reciprocally
dependent
quantities
and
neither
can
be
fully
discussed
without
taking
notice
of
the
other
but
the
forest
regarded
purely
as
inorganic
matter
and
without
reference
to
its
living
processes
of
absorption
and
exhalation
of
water
and
gases
has
as
an
absorbent
a
radiator
and
a
conductor
of
heat
and
as
a
mere
covering
of
the
ground
an
influence
on
the
temperature
of
the
air
and
the
earth
which
may
be
considered
by
itself
a
and
emitting
a
given
area
of
ground
as
estimated
by
the
rule
of
measurement
in
yards
or
acres
presents
always
the
same
apparent
quantity
of
absorbing
radiating
and
reflecting
surface
but
the
real
extent
of
that
surface
is
very
variable
depending
as
it
does
upon
its
configuration
and
the
bulk
and
form
of
the
adventitious
objects
it
bears
upon
it
and
besides
the
true
superficies
remaining
the
same
its
power
of
absorption
radiation
reflection
and
conduction
of
heat
will
be
much
affected
by
its
consistence
its
greater
or
less
humidity
and
its
color
as
well
as
by
its
inclination
of
plane
and
exposure
an
acre
of
chalk
rolled
hard
and
smooth
would
have
great
reflecting
power
but
its
radiation
would
be
much
increased
by
breaking
it
up
into
clods
because
the
actually
exposed
surface
would
be
greater
though
the
outline
of
the
field
remained
the
same
the
area
of
a
triangle
being
equal
to
its
base
multiplied
by
half
the
length
of
a
perpendicular
let
fall
from
its
apex
it
follows
that
the
entire
superficies
of
the
triangular
faces
of
a
quadrangular
pyramid
the
perpendicular
of
whose
sides
should
be
twice
the
length
of
the
base
would
be
four
times
the
area
of
the
ground
it
covered
and
would
add
to
the
field
on
which
it
stood
so
much
surface
capable
of
receiving
and
emitting
heat
though
in
consequence
of
obliquity
and
direction
of
plane
its
actual
absorption
and
emission
of
heat
might
not
be
so
great
as
that
of
an
additional
quantity
of
level
ground
containing
four
times
the
area
of
its
base
the
lesser
inequalities
which
always
occur
in
the
surface
of
ordinary
earth
affect
in
the
same
way
its
quantity
of
superficies
acting
upon
the
temperature
of
the
atmosphere
and
acted
on
by
it
though
the
amount
of
this
action
and
reaction
is
not
susceptible
of
measurement
analogous
effects
are
produced
by
other
objects
of
whatever
form
or
character
standing
or
lying
upon
the
earth
and
no
solid
can
be
placed
upon
a
flat
piece
of
ground
without
itself
exposing
a
greater
surface
than
it
covers
this
applies
of
course
to
forest
trees
and
their
leaves
and
indeed
to
all
vegetables
as
well
as
to
other
prominent
bodies
if
we
suppose
forty
trees
to
be
planted
on
an
acre
one
being
situated
in
the
centre
of
every
square
of
two
rods
the
side
and
to
grow
until
their
branches
and
leaves
everywhere
meet
it
is
evident
that
when
in
full
foliage
the
trunks
branches
and
leaves
would
present
an
amount
of
thermoscopic
surface
much
greater
than
that
of
an
acre
of
bare
earth
and
besides
this
the
fallen
leaves
lying
scattered
on
the
ground
would
somewhat
augment
the
sum
total
on
the
other
hand
the
growing
leaves
of
trees
generally
form
a
succession
of
stages
or
loosely
speaking
layers
corresponding
to
the
animal
growth
of
the
branches
and
more
or
less
overlying
each
other
this
disposition
of
the
foliage
interferes
with
that
free
communication
between
sun
and
sky
above
and
leaf
surface
below
on
which
the
amount
of
radiation
and
absorption
of
heat
depends
from
all
these
considerations
it
appears
that
though
the
effective
thermoscopic
surface
of
a
forest
in
full
leaf
does
not
exceed
that
of
bare
ground
in
the
same
proportion
as
does
its
measured
superficies
yet
the
actual
quantity
of
area
capable
of
receiving
and
emitting
heat
must
be
greater
in
the
former
than
in
the
latter
case
it
must
further
be
remembered
that
the
form
and
texture
of
a
given
surface
are
important
elements
in
determining
its
thermoscopic
character
leaves
are
porous
and
admit
air
and
light
more
or
less
freely
into
their
substance
they
are
generally
smooth
and
even
glazed
on
one
surface
they
are
usually
covered
on
one
or
both
sides
with
spiculæ
and
they
very
commonly
present
one
or
more
acuminated
points
in
their
outline
all
circumstances
which
tend
to
augment
their
power
of
emitting
heat
by
reflection
or
radiation
direct
experiment
on
growing
trees
is
very
difficult
nor
is
it
in
any
case
practicable
to
distinguish
how
far
a
reduction
of
temperature
produced
by
vegetation
is
due
to
radiation
and
how
far
to
exhalation
of
the
fluids
of
the
plant
in
a
gaseous
form
for
both
processes
usually
go
on
together
but
the
frigorific
effect
of
leafy
structure
is
well
observed
in
the
deposit
of
dew
and
the
occurrence
of
hoarfrost
on
the
foliage
of
grasses
and
other
small
vegetables
and
on
other
objects
of
similar
form
and
consistence
when
the
temperature
of
the
air
a
few
yards
above
has
not
been
brought
down
to
the
dew
point
still
less
to
the
degree
of
cold
required
to
congeal
dew
to
frost
b
as
conductors
of
we
are
also
to
take
into
account
the
action
of
the
forest
as
a
conductor
of
heat
between
the
atmosphere
and
the
earth
in
the
most
important
countries
of
america
and
europe
and
especially
in
those
which
have
suffered
most
from
the
destruction
of
the
woods
the
superficial
strata
of
the
earth
are
colder
in
winter
and
warmer
in
summer
than
those
a
few
inches
lower
and
their
shifting
temperature
approximates
to
the
atmospheric
mean
of
the
respective
seasons
the
roots
of
large
trees
penetrate
beneath
the
superficial
strata
and
reach
earth
of
a
nearly
constant
temperature
corresponding
to
the
mean
for
the
entire
year
as
conductors
they
convey
the
heat
of
the
atmosphere
to
the
earth
when
the
earth
is
colder
than
the
air
and
transmit
it
in
the
contrary
direction
when
the
temperature
of
the
earth
is
higher
than
that
of
the
atmosphere
of
course
then
as
conductors
they
tend
to
equalize
the
temperature
of
the
earth
and
the
air
in
summer
and
in
countries
where
the
questions
i
am
considering
have
the
greatest
practical
importance
a
very
large
proportion
if
not
a
majority
of
the
trees
are
of
deciduous
foliage
and
their
radiating
as
well
as
their
shading
surface
is
very
much
greater
in
summer
than
in
winter
in
the
latter
season
they
little
obstruct
the
reception
of
heat
by
the
ground
or
the
radiation
from
it
whereas
in
the
former
they
often
interpose
a
complete
canopy
between
the
ground
and
the
sky
and
materially
interfere
with
both
processes
products
of
besides
this
various
action
of
standing
trees
considered
as
inorganic
matter
the
forest
exercises
by
the
annual
moulting
of
its
foliage
still
another
influence
on
the
temperature
of
the
earth
and
consequently
of
the
atmosphere
which
rests
upon
it
if
you
examine
the
constitution
of
the
superficial
soil
in
a
primitive
or
an
old
and
undisturbed
artificially
planted
wood
you
find
first
a
deposit
of
undecayed
leaves
twigs
and
seeds
lying
in
loose
layers
on
the
surface
then
more
compact
beds
of
the
same
materials
in
incipient
and
as
you
descend
more
and
more
advanced
stages
of
decomposition
then
a
mass
of
black
mould
in
which
traces
of
organic
structure
are
hardly
discoverable
except
by
microscopic
examination
then
a
stratum
of
mineral
soil
more
or
less
mixed
with
vegetable
matter
carried
down
into
it
by
water
or
resulting
from
the
decay
of
roots
and
finally
the
inorganic
earth
or
rock
itself
without
this
deposit
of
the
dead
products
of
trees
this
latter
would
be
the
superficial
stratum
and
as
its
powers
of
absorption
radiation
and
conduction
of
heat
would
differ
essentially
from
those
of
the
layers
with
which
it
has
been
covered
by
the
droppings
of
the
forest
it
would
act
upon
the
temperature
of
the
atmosphere
and
be
acted
on
by
it
in
a
very
different
way
from
the
leaves
and
mould
which
rest
upon
it
leaves
still
entire
or
partially
decayed
are
very
indifferent
conductors
of
heat
and
therefore
though
they
diminish
the
warming
influence
of
the
summer
sun
on
the
soil
below
them
they
on
the
other
hand
prevent
the
escape
of
heat
from
that
soil
in
winter
and
consequently
in
cold
climates
even
when
the
ground
is
not
covered
by
a
protecting
mantle
of
snow
the
earth
does
not
freeze
to
as
great
a
depth
in
the
wood
as
in
the
open
field
as
a
shelter
to
ground
to
the
the
action
of
the
forest
considered
merely
as
a
mechanical
shelter
to
grounds
lying
to
the
leeward
of
it
would
seem
to
be
an
influence
of
too
restricted
a
character
to
deserve
much
notice
but
many
facts
concur
to
show
that
it
is
an
important
element
in
local
climate
and
that
it
is
often
a
valuable
means
of
defence
against
the
spread
of
miasmatic
effluvia
though
in
this
last
case
it
may
exercise
a
chemical
as
well
as
a
mechanical
agency
in
the
report
of
a
committee
appointed
in
to
examine
an
article
of
the
forest
code
of
france
arago
observes
if
a
curtain
of
forest
on
the
coasts
of
normandy
and
of
brittany
were
destroyed
these
two
provinces
would
become
accessible
to
the
winds
from
the
west
to
the
mild
breezes
of
the
sea
hence
a
decrease
of
the
cold
of
winter
if
a
similar
forest
were
to
be
cleared
on
the
eastern
border
of
france
the
glacial
east
wind
would
prevail
with
greater
strength
and
the
winters
would
become
more
severe
thus
the
removal
of
a
belt
of
wood
would
produce
opposite
effects
in
the
two
regions
this
opinion
receives
confirmation
from
an
observation
of
dwight
who
remarks
in
reference
to
the
woods
of
new
england
another
effect
of
removing
the
forest
will
be
the
free
passage
of
the
winds
and
among
them
of
the
southern
winds
over
the
surface
this
i
think
has
been
an
increasing
fact
within
my
own
remembrance
as
the
cultivation
of
the
country
has
extended
farther
to
the
north
the
winds
from
the
south
have
reached
distances
more
remote
from
the
ocean
and
imparted
their
warmth
frequently
and
in
such
degrees
as
forty
years
since
were
in
the
same
places
very
little
known
this
fact
also
contributes
to
lengthen
the
summer
and
to
shorten
the
of
the
year
it
is
thought
in
italy
that
the
clearing
of
the
apennines
has
very
materially
affected
the
climate
of
the
valley
of
the
po
it
is
asserted
in
le
alpi
che
cingono
that
in
consequence
of
the
felling
of
the
woods
on
the
apennines
the
sirocco
prevails
greatly
on
the
right
bank
of
the
po
in
the
parmesan
territory
and
in
a
part
of
lombardy
it
injures
the
harvests
and
the
vineyards
and
sometimes
ruins
the
crops
of
the
season
to
the
same
cause
many
ascribe
the
meteorological
changes
in
the
precincts
of
modena
and
of
reggio
in
the
communes
of
these
districts
where
formerly
straw
roofs
resisted
the
force
of
the
winds
tiles
are
now
hardly
sufficient
in
others
where
tiles
answered
for
roofs
large
slabs
of
stone
are
now
ineffectual
and
in
many
neighboring
communes
the
grapes
and
the
grain
are
swept
off
by
the
blasts
of
the
south
and
southwest
winds
on
the
other
hand
according
to
the
same
authority
the
pinery
of
porto
near
ravenna
which
is
kilometres
long
and
is
one
of
the
oldest
pine
woods
in
italy
having
been
replanted
with
resinous
trees
after
it
was
unfortunately
cut
has
relieved
the
city
from
the
sirocco
to
which
it
had
become
exposed
and
in
a
great
degree
restored
its
ancient
climate
the
felling
of
the
woods
on
the
atlantic
coast
of
jutland
has
exposed
the
soil
not
only
to
drifting
sands
but
to
sharp
sea
winds
that
have
exerted
a
sensible
deteriorating
effect
on
the
climate
of
that
peninsula
which
has
no
mountains
to
serve
at
once
as
a
barrier
to
the
force
of
the
winds
and
as
a
storehouse
of
moisture
received
by
precipitation
or
condensed
from
atmospheric
vapors
it
is
evident
that
the
effect
of
the
forest
as
a
mechanical
impediment
to
the
passage
of
the
wind
would
extend
to
a
very
considerable
distance
above
its
own
height
and
hence
protect
while
standing
or
lay
open
when
felled
a
much
larger
surface
than
might
at
first
thought
be
supposed
the
atmosphere
movable
as
are
its
particles
and
light
and
elastic
as
are
its
masses
is
nevertheless
held
together
as
a
continuous
whole
by
the
gravitation
of
its
atoms
and
their
consequent
pressure
on
each
other
if
not
by
attraction
between
them
and
therefore
an
obstruction
which
mechanically
impedes
the
movement
of
a
given
stratum
of
air
will
retard
the
passage
of
the
strata
above
and
below
it
to
this
effect
may
often
be
added
that
of
an
ascending
current
from
the
forest
itself
which
must
always
exist
when
the
atmosphere
within
the
wood
is
warmer
than
the
stratum
of
air
above
it
and
must
be
of
almost
constant
occurrence
in
the
case
of
cold
winds
from
whatever
quarter
because
the
still
air
in
the
forest
is
slow
in
taking
up
the
temperature
of
the
moving
columns
and
currents
around
and
above
it
experience
in
fact
has
shown
that
mere
rows
of
trees
and
even
much
lower
obstructions
are
of
essential
service
in
defending
vegetation
against
the
action
of
the
wind
hardy
proposes
planting
in
algeria
belts
of
trees
at
the
distance
of
one
hundred
mètres
from
each
other
as
a
shelter
which
experience
had
proved
to
be
useful
in
france
in
the
valley
of
the
rhone
says
becquerel
a
simple
hedge
two
mètres
in
height
is
a
sufficient
protection
for
a
distance
of
mètres
the
mechanical
shelter
acts
no
doubt
chiefly
as
a
defence
against
the
mechanical
force
of
the
wind
but
its
uses
are
by
no
means
limited
to
this
effect
if
the
current
of
air
which
it
resists
moves
horizontally
it
would
prevent
the
access
of
cold
or
parching
blasts
to
the
ground
for
a
great
distance
and
did
the
wind
even
descend
at
a
large
angle
with
the
surface
still
a
considerable
extent
of
ground
would
be
protected
by
a
forest
to
the
windward
of
it
if
we
suppose
the
trees
of
a
wood
to
have
a
mean
height
of
only
twenty
yards
they
would
often
beneficially
affect
the
temperature
or
the
moisture
of
a
belt
of
land
two
or
three
hundred
yards
in
width
and
thus
perhaps
rescue
valuable
crops
from
destruction
the
local
retardation
of
spring
so
much
complained
of
in
italy
france
and
switzerland
and
the
increased
frequency
of
late
frosts
at
that
season
appear
to
be
ascribable
to
the
admission
of
cold
blasts
to
the
surface
by
the
felling
of
the
forests
which
formerly
both
screened
it
as
by
a
wall
and
communicated
the
warmth
of
their
soil
to
the
air
and
earth
to
the
leeward
caimi
states
that
since
the
cutting
down
of
the
woods
of
the
apennines
the
cold
winds
destroy
or
stunt
the
vegetation
and
that
in
consequence
of
the
usurpation
of
winter
on
the
domain
of
spring
the
district
of
mugello
has
lost
all
its
mulberries
except
the
few
which
find
in
the
lee
of
buildings
a
protection
like
that
once
furnished
by
the
forest
it
is
proved
says
clavé
études
that
the
department
of
ardèche
which
now
contains
not
a
single
considerable
wood
has
experienced
within
thirty
years
a
climatic
disturbance
of
which
the
late
frosts
formerly
unknown
in
the
country
are
one
of
the
most
melancholy
effects
similar
results
have
been
observed
in
the
plain
of
alsace
in
consequence
of
the
denudation
of
several
of
the
crests
of
the
vosges
dussard
as
quoted
by
ribbe
maintains
that
even
the
or
northwest
wind
whose
chilling
blasts
are
so
fatal
to
tender
vegetation
in
the
spring
is
the
child
of
man
the
result
of
his
devastations
under
the
reign
of
augustus
continues
he
the
forests
which
protected
the
cévennes
were
felled
or
destroyed
by
fire
in
mass
a
vast
country
before
covered
with
impenetrable
woods
powerful
obstacles
to
the
movement
and
even
to
the
formation
of
hurricanes
was
suddenly
denuded
swept
bare
stripped
and
soon
after
a
scourge
hitherto
unknown
struck
terror
over
the
land
from
avignon
to
the
bouches
du
rhone
thence
to
marseilles
and
then
extended
its
ravages
diminished
indeed
by
a
long
career
which
had
partially
exhausted
its
force
over
the
whole
maritime
frontier
the
people
thought
this
wind
a
curse
sent
of
god
they
raised
altars
to
it
and
offered
sacrifices
to
appease
its
rage
it
seems
however
that
this
plague
was
less
destructive
than
at
present
until
the
close
of
the
sixteenth
century
when
further
clearings
had
removed
most
of
the
remaining
barriers
to
its
course
up
to
that
time
the
northwest
wind
appears
not
to
have
attained
to
the
maximum
of
specific
effect
which
now
characterizes
it
as
a
local
phenomenon
extensive
districts
from
which
the
rigor
of
the
seasons
has
now
banished
valuable
crops
were
not
then
exposed
to
the
loss
of
their
harvests
by
tempests
cold
or
drought
the
deterioration
was
rapid
in
its
progress
under
the
consulate
the
clearings
had
exerted
so
injurious
an
effect
upon
the
climate
that
the
cultivation
of
the
olive
had
retreated
several
leagues
and
since
the
winters
and
springs
of
and
this
branch
of
rural
industry
has
been
abandoned
in
a
great
number
of
localities
where
it
was
advantageously
pursued
before
the
orange
now
flourishes
only
at
a
few
sheltered
points
of
the
coast
and
it
is
threatened
even
at
ilyères
where
the
clearing
of
the
hills
near
the
town
has
proved
very
prejudicial
to
this
valuable
tree
marchand
informs
us
that
since
the
felling
of
the
woods
late
spring
frosts
are
more
frequent
in
many
localities
north
of
the
alps
that
fruit
trees
thrive
well
no
longer
and
that
it
is
difficult
to
raise
young
trees
as
a
protection
against
the
influence
of
forests
in
preventing
the
diffusion
of
miasmatic
vapors
is
a
matter
of
less
familiar
observation
and
perhaps
does
not
come
strictly
within
the
sphere
of
the
present
inquiry
but
its
importance
will
justify
me
in
devoting
some
space
to
the
subject
it
has
been
observed
i
quote
again
from
becquerel
that
humid
air
charged
with
miasmata
is
deprived
of
them
in
passing
through
the
forest
rigaud
de
lille
observed
localities
in
italy
where
the
interposition
of
a
screen
of
trees
preserved
everything
beyond
it
while
the
unprotected
grounds
were
subject
to
fevers
few
european
countries
present
better
opportunities
for
observation
on
this
point
than
italy
because
in
that
kingdom
the
localities
exposed
to
miasmatic
exhalations
are
numerous
and
belts
of
trees
if
not
forests
are
of
so
frequent
occurrence
that
their
efficacy
in
this
respect
can
be
easily
tested
the
belief
that
rows
of
trees
afford
an
important
protection
against
malarious
influences
is
very
general
among
italians
best
qualified
by
intelligence
and
professional
experience
to
judge
upon
the
subject
the
commissioners
appointed
to
report
on
the
measures
to
be
adopted
for
the
improvement
of
the
tuscan
maremme
advised
the
planting
of
three
or
four
rows
of
poplars
in
such
directions
as
to
obstruct
the
currents
of
air
from
malarious
localities
and
thus
intercept
a
great
proportion
of
the
pernicious
exhalations
lieutenant
maury
even
believed
that
a
few
rows
of
sunflowers
planted
between
the
washington
observatory
and
the
marshy
banks
of
the
potomac
had
saved
the
inmates
of
that
establishment
from
the
intermittent
fevers
to
which
they
had
been
formerly
liable
maury
experiments
have
been
repeated
in
italy
large
plantations
of
sunflowers
have
been
made
upon
the
alluvial
deposits
of
the
oglio
above
its
entrance
into
the
lake
of
iseo
near
pisogne
and
it
is
said
with
favorable
results
to
the
health
of
the
neighborhood
in
fact
the
generally
beneficial
effects
of
a
forest
wall
or
other
vegetable
screen
as
a
protection
against
noxious
exhalations
from
marshes
or
other
sources
of
disease
situated
to
the
windward
of
them
are
very
commonly
admitted
it
is
argued
that
in
these
cases
the
foliage
of
trees
and
of
other
vegetables
exercises
a
chemical
as
well
as
a
mechanical
effect
upon
the
atmosphere
and
some
who
allow
that
forests
may
intercept
the
circulation
of
the
miasmatic
effluvia
of
swampy
soils
or
even
render
them
harmless
by
decomposing
them
contend
nevertheless
that
they
are
themselves
active
causes
of
the
production
of
malaria
the
subject
has
been
a
good
deal
discussed
in
italy
and
there
is
some
reason
to
think
that
under
special
circumstances
the
influence
of
the
forest
in
this
respect
may
be
prejudicial
rather
than
salutary
though
this
does
not
appear
to
be
generally
the
case
it
is
at
all
events
well
known
that
the
great
swamps
of
virginia
and
the
carolinas
in
climates
nearly
similar
to
that
of
italy
are
healthy
even
to
the
white
man
so
long
as
the
forests
in
and
around
them
remain
but
become
very
insalubrious
when
the
woods
are
felled
forest
as
inorganic
matter
tends
to
mitigate
the
surface
which
trees
and
leaves
present
augments
the
general
superficies
of
the
earth
exposed
to
the
absorption
of
heat
and
increases
the
radiating
and
reflecting
area
in
the
same
proportion
it
is
impossible
to
measure
the
relative
value
of
these
two
elements
increase
of
absorbing
and
increase
of
emitting
surface
as
thermometrical
influences
because
they
exert
themselves
under
infinitely
varied
conditions
and
it
is
equally
impossible
to
make
a
quantitative
estimate
of
any
partial
still
more
of
the
total
effect
of
the
forest
considered
as
dead
matter
on
the
temperature
of
the
atmosphere
and
of
the
portion
of
the
earth
surface
acted
on
by
it
but
it
seems
probable
that
its
greatest
influence
in
this
respect
is
due
to
its
character
of
a
screen
or
mechanical
obstacle
to
the
transmission
of
heat
between
the
earth
and
the
air
and
this
is
equally
true
of
the
standing
tree
and
of
the
dead
foliage
which
it
deposits
in
successive
layers
at
its
foot
the
complicated
action
of
trees
and
their
products
as
dead
absorbents
radiators
reflectors
and
conductors
of
heat
and
as
interceptors
of
its
transmission
is
so
intimately
connected
with
their
effects
upon
the
humidity
of
the
air
and
the
earth
and
with
all
their
living
processes
that
it
is
difficult
to
separate
the
former
from
the
latter
class
of
influences
but
upon
the
whole
the
forest
must
thus
far
be
regarded
as
tending
to
mitigate
extremes
and
therefore
as
an
equalizer
of
temperature
trees
as
organisms
trees
considered
as
organisms
produce
in
themselves
or
in
the
air
a
certain
amount
of
heat
by
absorbing
and
condensing
atmospheric
vapor
and
they
exert
an
opposite
influence
by
absorbing
water
and
exhaling
it
in
the
form
of
vapor
but
there
is
still
another
mode
by
which
their
living
processes
may
warm
the
air
around
them
independently
of
the
thermometric
effects
of
condensation
and
evaporation
the
vital
heat
of
a
dozen
persons
raises
the
temperature
of
a
room
if
trees
possess
a
specific
temperature
of
their
own
an
organic
power
of
generating
heat
like
that
with
which
the
animals
are
gifted
though
by
a
different
process
a
certain
amount
of
weight
is
to
be
ascribed
to
this
element
in
estimating
the
action
of
the
forest
upon
atmospheric
temperature
observation
shows
says
meguscher
that
the
wood

that
the

it
is
easy
to
see
why

cooler
in

than
in
situations

boussingault

in

there
has

a

considerable
evolution
of

at
the

in
certain
the
temperature
rises
to

or
it
is
very
probable
that
this
phenomenon
is
general
and
varies
only
in
the
intensity
with
which
it
is
manifested
if
we
suppose
the
fecundation
of
the
flowers
of
forest
trees
to
be
attended
with
a
tenth

of
this

for
that
distinguished
physicist
observes
as
a
general
deduction
from
chemical
and
mechanical
principles
we
think
no
change
of
temperature
is
ever
produced
where
the
actions
belonging
to
one
or
both
of
these
principles
are
not
present
hence
in
midwinter
when
all
vegetable
functions
are
dormant
we
do
not
believe
that
any
heat
is
developed
by
a
tree
or
that
its
interior
differs
in
temperature
from
its
exterior
further
than
it
is
protected
from
the
external
air
the
experiments
which
have
been
made
on
this
point
we
think
have
been
directed
by
a
false
analogy
during
the
active
circulation
of
the
sap
and
the
production
of
new
tissue
variations
of
temperature
belonging
exclusively
to
the
plant
may
be
observed
but
it
is
inconsistent
with
general
principles
that
heat
should
be
generated
where
no
change
is
taking
place
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
moisture
is
given
out
by
trees
and
evaporated
in
extremely
cold
and
unless
new
fluid
were
supplied
from
the
roots
the
tree
would
be
exhausted
of
its
juices
before
winter
was
over
but
this
is
not
observed
to
be
the
fact
and
though
the
point
is
disputed
respectable
authorities
declare
that

we
can

atkinson
describes
a
ravine
in
a
valley
in
siberia
which
was
filled
with
ice
to
the
depth
of
feet
poplars
were
growing
in
this
ice
which
was
thawed
to
the
distance
of
some
inches
from
the
stem
but
the
surface
of
the
soil
beneath
it
must
have
remained
still
frozen
for
the
holes
around
the
trees
were
full
of
water
resulting
from
its
melting
and
this
would
have
escaped
below
if
the
ground
had
been
thawed
in
this
case
although
the
roots
had
not
thawed
the
thick
covering
of
earth
above
them
the
trunks
must
have
melted
the
ice
in
contact
with
them
the
trees
when
observed
by
atkinson
were
in
full
leaf
but
it
does
not
appear
at
what
period
the
ice
around
their
stems
had
melted
from
these
facts
and
others
of
the
like
sort
it
would
seem
that
all
vegetable
functions
are
not
absolutely
dormant
in
winter
and
therefore
that
trees
may
give
out
heat
at
that
season
but
however
this
may
be
the
circulation
of
the
sap
commences
at
a
very
early
period
in
the
spring
and
the
temperature
of
the
air
in

with

may
then
be
sufficiently
affected

the

of

its

and
investigators
differ
much
in
their
conclusions
on
this
subject
it
seems
probable
that
in
every
particular
case
the
result
is
if
not
determined
at
least
so
much
modified
by
local
conditions
which
are
infinitely
varied
that
no
general
formula
is
applicable
to
the
question
in
the
report
to
which
i
referred
on
page
says
in
my
opinion
we
have
not
yet
any
positive
proof
that
the
forest
has
in
itself
any
real
influence
on
the
climate
of
a
great
country
or
of
a
particular
locality
by
closely
examining
the
effects
of
clearing
off
the
woods
we
should
perhaps
find
that
far
from
being
an
evil
it
is
an
advantage
but
these
questions
are
so
complicated
when
they
are
examined
in
a
climatological
point
of
view
that
the
solution
of
them
is
very
difficult
not
to
say
impossible
becquerel
on
the
other
hand
considers
it
certain
that
in
tropical
climates
the
destruction
of
the
forests
is
accompanied
with
an
elevation
of
the
mean
temperature
and
he
thinks
it
highly
probable
that
it
has
the
same
effect
in
the
temperate
zones
the
following
is
the
substance
of
his
remarks
on
this
subject
forests
act
as
frigorific
causes
in
three
ways
they
shelter
the
ground
against
solar
irradiation
and
maintain
a
greater
humidity
they
produce
a
cutaneous
transpiration
by
the
leaves
they
multiply
by
the
expansion
of
their
branches
the
surfaces
which
are
cooled
by
radiation
these
three
causes
acting
with
greater
or
less
force
we
must
in
the
study
of
the
climatology
of
a
country
take
into
account
the
proportion
between
the
area
of
the
forests
and
the
surface
which
is
bared
of
trees
and
covered
with
herbs
and
grasses
we
should
be
inclined
to
believe
according
to
the
foregoing
considerations
that
the
clearing
of
the
woods
by
raising
the
temperature
and
increasing
the
dryness
of
the
air
ought
to
react
on
climate
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
the
vast
desert
of
the
sahara
were
to
become
wooded
in
the
course
of
ages
the
sands
would
cease
to
be
heated
as
much
as
at
the
present
epoch
when
the
mean
temperature
is
degrees
centigrade
in
that
case
the
ascending
currents
of
warm
air
would
cease
or
be
less
warm
and
would
not
contribute
by
descending
in
our
latitudes
to
soften
the
climate
of
western
europe
thus
the
clearing
of
a
great
country
may
react
on
the
climates
of
regions
more
or
less
remote
from
it
the
observations
by
boussingault
leave
no
doubt
on
this
point
this
writer
determined
the
mean
temperature
of
wooded
and
of
cleared
points
under
the
same
latitude
and
at
the
same
elevation
above
the
sea
in
localities
comprised
between
the
eleventh
degree
of
north
and
the
fifth
degree
of
south
latitude
that
is
to
say
in
the
portion
of
the
tropics
nearest
to
the
equator
and
where
radiation
tends
powerfully
during
the
night
to
lower
the
temperature
under
a
sky
without
clouds
the
result
of
these
observations
which
has
been
pretty
generally
adopted
by
physicists
is
that
the
mean
temperature
of
cleared
land
in
the
tropics
appears
to
be
about
one
degree
centigrade
or
a
little
less
than
two
degrees
of
fahrenheit
above
that
of
the
forest
on
page
of
the
volume
just
cited
becquerel
argues
that
inasmuch
as
the
same
and
sometimes
a
greater
difference
is
found
in
favor
of
the
open
ground
at
points
within
the
tropics
so
elevated
as
to
have
a
temperate
or
even
a
polar
climate
we
must
conclude
that
the
forests
in
northern
america
exert
a
refrigerating
influence
equally
powerful
but
the
conditions
of
the
soil
are
so
different
in
the
two
regions
compared
that
i
think
we
can
not
with
entire
confidence
reason
from
the
one
to
the
other
and
it
is
much
to
be
desired
that
observations
be
made
on
the
summer
and
winter
temperature
of
both
the
air
and
the
ground
in
the
depths
of
the
north
american
forests
before
it
is
too
late
influence
of
forests
on
the
humidity
of
the
air
and
the
earth
a
inorganic
the
most
important
influence
of
the
forest
on
climate
is
no
doubt
that
which
it
exercises
on
the
humidity
of
the
air
and
the
earth
and
this
climatic
action
it
exerts
partly
as
dead
partly
as
living
matter
by
its
interposition
as
a
curtain
between
the
sky
and
the
ground
it
intercepts
a
large
proportion
of
the
dew
and
the
lighter
showers
which
would
otherwise
moisten
the
surface
of
the
soil
and
restores
it
to
the
atmosphere
by
evaporation
while
in
heavier
rains
the
large
drops
which
fall
upon
the
leaves
and
branches
are
broken
into
smaller
ones
and
consequently
strike
the
ground
with
less
mechanical
force
or
are
perhaps
even
dispersed
into
vapor
without
reaching
it
as
a
screen
it
prevents
the
access
of
the
sun
rays
to
the
earth
and
of
course
an
elevation
of
temperature
which
would
occasion
a
great
increase
of
evaporation
as
a
mechanical
obstruction
it
impedes
the
passage
of
air
currents
over
the
ground
which
as
is
well
known
is
one
of
the
most
efficient
agents
in
promoting
evaporation
and
the
refrigeration
resulting
from
it
in
the
forest
the
air
is
almost
quiescent
and
moves
only
as
local
changes
of
temperature
affect
the
specific
gravity
of
its
particles
hence
there
is
often
a
dead
calm
in
the
woods
when
a
furious
blast
is
raging
in
the
open
country
at
a
few
yards
distance
the
denser
the
forest
as
for
example
where
it
consists
of
trees
or
is
thickly
intermixed
with
them
the
more
obvious
is
its
effect
and
no
one
can
have
passed
from
the
field
to
the
wood
in
cold
windy
weather
without
having
remarked
it
the
vegetable
mould
resulting
from
the
decomposition
of
leaves
and
of
wood
carpets
the
ground
with
a
spongy
covering
which
obstructs
the
evaporation
from
the
mineral
earth
below
drinks
up
the
rains
and
melting
snows
that
would
otherwise
flow
rapidly
over
the
surface
and
perhaps
be
conveyed
to
the
distant
sea
and
then
slowly
gives
out
by
evaporation
infiltration
and
percolation
the
moisture
thus
imbibed
the
roots
too
penetrate
far
below
the
superficial
soil
conduct
the
water
along
their
surface
to
the
lower
depths
to
which
they
reach
and
thus
serve
to
drain
the
superior
strata
and
remove
the
moisture
out
of
the
reach
of
evaporation
b
forest
as
these
are
the
principal
modes
in
which
the
humidity
of
the
atmosphere
is
affected
by
the
forest
regarded
as
lifeless
matter
let
us
inquire
how
its
organic
processes
act
upon
this
meteorological
element
the
commonest
observation
shows
that
the
wood
and
bark
of
living
trees
are
always
more
or
less
pervaded
with
watery
and
other
fluids
one
of
which
the
sap
is
very
abundant
in
trees
of
deciduous
foliage
when
the
buds
begin
to
swell
and
the
leaves
to
develop
themselves
in
the
spring
the
outer
bark
of
most
trees
is
of
a
corky
character
not
admitting
the
absorption
of
much
moisture
from
the
atmosphere
through
its
pores
and
we
can
hardly
suppose
that
the
buds
are
able
to
extract
from
the
air
a
much
larger
supply
the
obvious
conclusion
as
to
the
source
from
which
the
extraordinary
quantity
of
sap
at
this
season
is
derived
is
that
to
which
scientific
investigation
leads
us
namely
that
it
is
absorbed
from
the
earth
by
the
roots
and
thence
distributed
to
all
parts
of
the
plant
popular
opinion
indeed
supposes
that
all
the
vegetable
fluids
during
the
entire
period
of
growth
are
thus
drawn
from
the
bosom
of
the
earth
and
that
the
wood
and
other
products
of
the
tree
are
wholly
formed
from
matter
held
in
solution
in
the
water
abstracted
by
the
roots
from
the
ground
this
is
an
error
for
not
only
is
the
solid
matter
of
the
tree
in
a
certain
proportion
not
important
to
our
present
inquiry
received
from
the
atmosphere
in
a
gaseous
form
through
the
pores
of
the
leaves
and
of
the
young
shoots
but
water
in
the
state
of
vapor
is
absorbed
and
contributed
to
the
circulation
by
the
same
organs
the
amount
of
water
taken
up
by
the
roots
however
is
vastly
greater
than
that
imbibed
through
the
leaves
especially
at
the
season
when
the
juices
are
most
abundant
and
when
as
we
have
seen
the
leaves
are
yet
in
embryo
the
quantity
of
water
thus
received
from
the
air
and
the
earth
in
a
single
year
by
a
wood
of
even
a
hundred
acres
is
very
great
though
experiments
are
wanting
to
furnish
the
data
for
even
an
approximate
estimate
of
its
measure
for
only
the
vaguest
conclusions
can
be
drawn
from
the
observations
which
have
been
made
on
the
imbibition
and
exhalation
of
water
by
trees
and
other
plants
reared
in
artificial
conditions
diverse
from
those
of
the
natural
forest
mosses
and
besides
the
water
drawn
by
the
roots
from
the
earth
and
the
vapor
absorbed
by
the
leaves
from
the
air
the
wood
mosses
and
fungi
which
abound
in
all
dense
forests
take
up
a
great
quantity
of
moisture
from
the
atmosphere
when
it
is
charged
with
humidity
and
exhale
it
again
when
the
air
is
dry
these
humble
organizations
which
play
a
more
important
part
in
regulating
the
humidity
of
the
air
than
writers
on
the
forest
have
usually
assigned
to
them
perish
with
the
trees
they
grow
on
but
in
many
situations
nature
provides
a
compensation
for
the
tree
mosses
in
ground
species
which
on
cold
soils
especially
those
with
a
northern
exposure
spring
up
abundantly
both
before
the
woods
are
felled
and
when
the
land
is
cleared
and
employed
for
pasturage
or
deserted
these
mosses
discharge
a
portion
of
the
functions
appropriated
to
the
wood
and
while
they
render
the
soil
of
improved
lands
much
less
fit
for
agricultural
use
they
at
the
same
time
prepare
it
for
the
growth
of
a
new
harvest
of
trees
when
the
infertility
they
produce
shall
have
driven
man
to
abandon
it
and
suffer
it
to
relapse
into
the
hands
of
nature
of
the
amount
of
sap
which
can
be
withdrawn
from
living
trees
furnishes
not
indeed
a
measure
of
the
quantity
of
water
sucked
up
by
their
roots
from
the
ground
for
we
can
not
extract
from
a
tree
its
whole
moisture
but
numerical
data
which
may
aid
the
imagination
to
form
a
general
notion
of
the
powerful
action
of
the
forest
as
an
absorbent
of
humidity
from
the
earth
the
only
forest
tree
known
to
europe
and
north
america
the
sap
of
which
is
largely
enough
applied
to
economical
uses
to
have
made
the
amount
of
its
flow
a
matter
of
practical
importance
and
popular
observation
is
the
sugar
maple
of
the
provinces
and
states
in
the
course
of
a
single
sugar
season
which
lasts
ordinarily
from
to
thirty
days
a
sugar
maple
two
feet
in
diameter
will
yield
not
less
than
twenty
gallons
of
sap
and
sometimes
much
more
this
however
is
but
a
trifling
proportion
of
the
water
abstracted
from
the
earth
by
the
roots
during
this
season
when
the
yet
undeveloped
leaves
can
hardly
absorb
an
appreciable
quantity
of
vapor
from
the
atmosphere
for
all
this
fluid
runs
from
two
or
three
incisions
or
auger
holes
so
narrow
as
to
intercept
the
current
of
comparatively
few
sap
vessels
and
besides
experience
shows
that
large
as
is
the
quantity
withdrawn
from
the
circulation
it
is
relatively
too
small
to
affect
very
sensibly
the
growth
of
the
tree
the
number
of
large
maple
trees
on
an
acre
is
frequently
not
less
than
fifty
and
of
course
the
quantity
of
moisture
abstracted
from
the
soil
by
this
tree
alone
is
measured
by
thousands
of
gallons
to
the
acre
the
sugar
orchards
as
they
are
called
contain
also
many
young
maples
too
small
for
tapping
and
numerous
other
trees
two
of
which
at
least
the
black
birch
and
yellow
birch
both
very
common
in
the
same
climate
are
far
more
abundant
in
sap
than
the
maple
are
scattered
among
the
sugar
trees
for
the
north
american
native
forests
are
remarkable
for
the
mixture
of
their
crops
the
sap
of
the
maple
and
of
other
trees
with
deciduous
leaves
which
grow
in
the
same
climate
flows
most
freely
in
the
early
spring
and
especially
in
clear
weather
when
the
nights
are
frosty
and
the
days
warm
for
it
is
then
that
the
melting
snows
supply
the
earth
with
moisture
in
the
justest
proportion
and
that
the
absorbent
power
of
the
roots
is
stimulated
to
its
highest
activity
when
the
buds
are
ready
to
burst
and
the
green
leaves
begin
to
show
themselves
beneath
their
scaly
covering
the
ground
has
become
drier
the
thirst
of
the
roots
is
quenched
and
the
flow
of
sap
from
them
to
the
stem
is
greatly
diminished
and
exhalation
of
the
leaves
now
commence
the
process
of
absorption
and
imbibe
both
uncombined
gases
and
an
unascertained
but
perhaps
considerable
quantity
of
watery
vapor
from
the
humid
atmosphere
of
spring
which
bathes
them
the
organic
action
of
the
tree
as
thus
far
described
tends
to
the
desiccation
of
air
and
earth
but
when
we
consider
what
volumes
of
water
are
daily
absorbed
by
a
large
tree
and
how
small
a
proportion
of
the
weight
of
this
fluid
consists
of
matter
which
enters
into
new
combinations
and
becomes
a
part
of
the
solid
framework
of
the
vegetable
or
a
component
of
its
deciduous
products
it
is
evident
that
the
superfluous
moisture
must
somehow
be
carried
off
almost
as
rapidly
as
it
flows
into
the
tree
at
the
very
commencement
of
vegetation
in
spring
some
of
this
fluid
certainly
escapes
through
the
buds
the
nascent
foliage
and
the
pores
of
the
barb
and
vegetable
physiology
tells
us
that
there
is
a
current
of
sap
toward
the
roots
as
well
as
from
them
i
do
not
know
that
the
exudation
of
water
into
the
earth
through
the
bark
or
at
the
extremities
of
these
latter
organs
has
been
directly
proved
but
the
other
known
modes
of
carrying
off
the
surplus
do
not
seem
adequate
to
dispose
of
it
at
the
almost
leafless
period
when
it
is
most
abundantly
received
and
it
is
therefore
difficult
to
believe
that
the
roots
do
not
to
some
extent
drain
as
well
as
flood
the
watercourses
of
their
stem
later
in
the
season
the
roots
absorb
less
and
the
now
developed
leaves
exhale
a
vastly
increased
quantity
of
moisture
into
the
air
in
any
event
all
the
water
derived
by
the
growing
tree
from
the
atmosphere
and
the
ground
is
returned
again
by
transpiration
or
exudation
after
having
surrendered
to
the
plant
the
small
proportion
of
matter
required
for
vegetable
growth
which
it
held
in
solution
or
suspension
the
hygrometrical
equilibrium
is
then
restored
so
far
as
this
the
tree
yields
up
again
the
moisture
it
had
drawn
from
the
earth
and
the
air
though
it
does
not
return
it
each
to
each
for
the
vapor
carried
off
by
transpiration
greatly
exceeds
the
quantity
of
water
absorbed
by
the
foliage
from
the
atmosphere
and
the
amount
if
any
carried
back
to
the
ground
by
the
roots
the
evaporation
of
the
juices
of
the
plant
by
whatever
process
effected
takes
up
atmospheric
heat
and
produces
refrigeration
this
effect
is
not
less
real
though
much
less
sensible
in
the
forest
than
in
meadow
or
pasture
land
and
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
local
temperature
is
considerably
affected
by
it
but
the
evaporation
that
cools
the
air
diffuses
through
it
at
the
same
time
a
medium
which
powerfully
resists
the
escape
of
heat
from
the
earth
by
radiation
visible
vapors
or
clouds
it
is
well
known
prevent
frosts
by
obstructing
radiation
or
rather
by
reflecting
back
again
the
heat
radiated
by
the
earth
just
as
any
mechanical
screen
would
do
on
the
other
hand
clouds
intercept
the
rays
of
the
sun
also
and
hinder
its
heat
from
reaching
the
earth
the
invisible
vapors
given
out
by
leaves
impede
the
passage
of
heat
reflected
and
radiated
by
the
earth
and
by
all
terrestrial
objects
but
oppose
much
less
resistance
to
the
transmission
of
direct
solar
heat
and
indeed
the
beams
of
the
sun
seem
more
scorching
when
received
through
clear
air
charged
with
uncondensed
moisture
than
after
passing
through
a
dry
atmosphere
hence
the
reduction
of
temperature
by
the
evaporation
of
moisture
from
vegetation
though
sensible
is
less
than
it
would
be
if
water
in
the
gaseous
state
were
as
impervious
to
heat
given
out
by
the
sun
as
to
that
emitted
by
terrestrial
objects
the
hygroscopicity
of
vegetable
mould
is
much
greater
than
that
of
any
mineral
earth
and
therefore
the
soil
of
the
forest
absorbs
more
atmospheric
moisture
than
the
open
ground
the
condensation
of
the
vapor
by
absorption
disengages
heat
and
consequently
raises
the
temperature
of
the
soil
which
absorbs
it
von
babo
found
the
temperature
of
sandy
earth
thus
elevated
from
to
centigrade
making
a
difference
of
nearly
thirteen
degrees
of
fahrenheit
and
that
of
soil
rich
in
humus
from
to
centigrade
a
difference
of
almost
twenty
degrees
of
fahrenheit
of
conflicting
we
have
shown
that
the
forest
considered
as
dead
matter
tends
to
diminish
the
moisture
of
the
air
by
preventing
the
sun
rays
from
reaching
the
ground
and
evaporating
the
water
that
falls
upon
the
surface
and
also
by
spreading
over
the
earth
a
spongy
mantle
which
sucks
up
and
retains
the
humidity
it
receives
from
the
atmosphere
while
at
the
same
time
this
covering
acts
in
the
contrary
direction
by
accumulating
in
a
reservoir
not
wholly
inaccessible
to
vaporizing
influences
the
water
of
precipitation
which
might
otherwise
suddenly
sink
deep
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
or
flow
by
superficial
channels
to
other
climatic
regions
we
now
see
that
as
a
living
organism
it
tends
on
the
one
hand
to
diminish
the
humidity
of
the
air
by
absorbing
moisture
from
it
and
on
the
other
to
increase
that
humidity
by
pouring
out
into
the
atmosphere
in
a
vaporous
form
the
water
it
draws
up
through
its
roots
this
last
operation
at
the
same
time
lowers
the
temperature
of
the
air
in
contact
with
or
proximity
to
the
wood
by
the
same
law
as
in
other
cases
of
the
conversion
of
water
into
vapor
as
i
have
repeatedly
said
we
can
not
measure
the
value
of
any
one
of
these
elements
of
climatic
disturbance
raising
or
lowering
of
temperature
increase
or
diminution
of
humidity
nor
can
we
say
that
in
any
one
season
any
one
year
or
any
one
fixed
cycle
however
long
or
short
they
balance
and
compensate
each
other
they
are
sometimes
but
certainly
not
always
contemporaneous
in
their
action
whether
their
tendency
is
in
the
same
or
in
opposite
directions
and
therefore
their
influence
is
sometimes
cumulative
sometimes
conflicting
but
upon
the
whole
their
general
effect
seems
to
be
to
mitigate
extremes
of
atmospheric
heat
and
cold
moisture
and
drought
they
serve
as
equalizers
of
temperature
and
humidity
and
it
is
highly
probable
that
in
analogy
with
most
other
works
and
workings
of
nature
they
at
certain
or
uncertain
periods
restore
the
equilibrium
which
whether
as
lifeless
masses
or
as
living
organisms
they
may
have
temporarily
disturbed
when
therefore
man
destroyed
these
natural
harmonizers
of
climatic
discords
he
sacrificed
an
important
conservative
power
though
it
is
far
from
certain
that
he
has
thereby
affected
the
mean
however
much
he
may
have
exaggerated
the
extremes
of
atmospheric
temperature
and
humidity
or
in
other
words
may
have
increased
the
range
and
lengthened
the
scale
of
thermometric
and
hygrometric
variation
of
the
forest
on
temperature
and
aside
from
the
question
of
compensation
it
does
not
seem
probable
that
the
forests
sensibly
affect
the
total
quantity
of
precipitation
or
the
general
mean
of
atmospheric
temperature
of
the
globe
or
even
that
they
had
this
influence
when
their
extent
was
vastly
greater
than
at
present
the
waters
cover
about
three
fourths
of
the
face
of
the
earth
and
if
we
deduct
the
frozen
zones
the
peaks
and
crests
of
lofty
mountains
and
their
craggy
slopes
the
sahara
and
other
great
african
and
asiatic
deserts
and
all
such
other
portions
of
the
solid
surface
as
are
permanently
unfit
for
the
growth
of
wood
we
shall
find
that
probably
not
one
tenth
of
the
total
superficies
of
our
planet
was
ever
at
any
one
time
in
the
present
geological
epoch
covered
with
forests
besides
this
the
distribution
of
forest
land
of
desert
and
of
water
is
such
as
to
reduce
the
possible
influence
of
the
former
to
a
low
expression
for
the
forests
are
in
large
proportion
situated
in
cold
or
temperate
climates
where
the
action
of
the
sun
is
comparatively
feeble
both
in
elevating
temperature
and
in
promoting
evaporation
while
in
the
torrid
zone
the
desert
and
the
sea
the
latter
of
which
always
presents
an
evaporable
surface
enormously
preponderate
it
is
upon
the
whole
not
probable
that
so
small
an
extent
of
forest
so
situated
could
produce
an
appreciable
influence
on
the
climate
of
the
globe
though
it
might
appreciably
affect
the
local
action
of
all
climatic
elements
the
total
annual
amount
of
solar
heat
absorbed
and
radiated
by
the
earth
and
the
sum
of
terrestrial
evaporation
and
atmospheric
precipitation
must
be
supposed
constant
but
the
distribution
of
heat
and
of
humidity
is
exposed
to
disturbance
in
both
time
and
place
by
a
multitude
of
local
causes
among
which
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
forest
is
doubtless
one
so
far
as
we
are
able
to
sum
up
the
general
results
it
would
appear
that
in
countries
in
the
temperate
zone
still
chiefly
covered
with
wood
the
summers
would
be
cooler
moister
shorter
the
winters
milder
drier
longer
than
in
the
same
regions
after
the
removal
of
the
forest
the
slender
historical
evidence
we
possess
seems
to
point
to
the
same
conclusion
though
there
is
some
conflict
of
testimony
and
of
opinion
on
this
point
and
some
apparently
exceptions
to
particular
branches
of
what
appears
to
be
the
general
law
one
of
these
occurs
both
in
climates
where
the
cold
of
winter
is
severe
enough
to
freeze
the
ground
to
a
considerable
depth
as
in
sweden
and
the
northern
states
of
the
american
union
and
in
milder
zones
where
the
face
of
the
earth
is
exposed
to
cold
mountain
winds
as
in
some
parts
of
italy
and
of
france
for
there
as
we
have
seen
the
winter
is
believed
to
extend
itself
into
the
months
which
belong
to
the
spring
later
than
at
periods
when
the
forest
covered
the
greater
part
of
the
ground
more
causes
than
one
doubtless
contribute
to
this
result
but
in
the
case
of
sweden
and
the
united
states
the
most
obvious
explanation
of
the
fact
is
to
be
found
in
the
loss
of
the
shelter
afforded
to
the
ground
by
the
thick
coating
of
leaves
which
the
forest
sheds
upon
it
and
the
snow
which
the
woods
protect
from
blowing
away
or
from
melting
in
the
brief
thaws
of
winter
i
have
already
remarked
that
bare
ground
freezes
much
deeper
than
that
which
is
covered
by
beds
of
leaves
and
when
the
earth
is
thickly
coated
with
snow
the
strata
frozen
before
it
fell
begin
to
thaw
it
is
not
uncommon
to
find
the
ground
in
the
woods
where
the
snow
lies
two
or
three
feet
deep
entirely
free
from
frost
when
the
atmospheric
temperature
has
been
for
several
weeks
below
the
freezing
point
and
for
some
days
even
below
the
zero
of
fahrenheit
when
the
ground
is
cleared
and
brought
under
cultivation
the
leaves
are
ploughed
into
the
soil
and
decomposed
and
the
snow
especially
upon
knolls
and
eminences
is
blown
off
or
perhaps
half
thawed
several
times
during
the
winter
the
water
from
the
melting
snow
runs
into
the
depressions
and
when
after
a
day
or
two
of
warm
sunshine
or
tepid
rain
the
cold
returns
it
is
consolidated
to
ice
and
the
bared
ridges
and
swells
of
earth
are
deeply
frozen
it
requires
many
days
of
mild
weather
to
raise
the
temperature
of
soil
in
this
condition
and
of
the
air
in
contact
with
it
to
that
of
the
earth
in
the
forests
of
the
same
climatic
region
flora
is
already
plaiting
her
sylvan
wreath
before
the
corn
flowers
which
are
to
deck
the
garland
of
ceres
have
waked
from
their
winter
sleep
and
it
is
not
a
popular
error
to
believe
that
where
man
has
substituted
his
artificial
crops
for
the
spontaneous
harvest
of
nature
spring
delays
her
coming
in
many
cases
the
apparent
change
in
the
period
of
the
seasons
is
a
purely
local
phenomenon
which
is
probably
compensated
by
a
higher
temperature
in
other
months
without
any
real
disturbance
of
the
average
thermometrical
equilibrium
we
may
easily
suppose
that
there
are
analogous
partial
deviations
from
the
general
law
of
precipitation
and
without
insisting
that
the
removal
of
the
forest
has
diminished
the
sum
total
of
snow
and
rain
we
may
well
admit
that
it
has
lessened
the
quantity
which
annually
falls
within
particular
limits
various
theoretical
considerations
make
this
probable
the
most
obvious
argument
perhaps
being
that
drawn
from
the
generally
admitted
fact
that
the
summer
and
even
the
mean
temperature
of
the
forest
is
below
that
of
the
open
country
in
the
same
latitude
if
the
air
in
a
wood
is
cooler
than
that
around
it
it
must
reduce
the
temperature
of
the
atmospheric
stratum
immediately
above
it
and
of
course
whenever
a
saturated
current
sweeps
over
it
it
must
produce
precipitation
which
would
fall
upon
or
near
it
but
the
subject
is
so
exceedingly
complex
and
difficult
that
it
is
safer
to
regard
it
as
a
historical
problem
or
at
least
as
what
lawyers
call
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
than
to
attempt
to
decide
it
upon
grounds
unfortunately
the
evidence
is
conflicting
in
tendency
and
sometimes
equivocal
in
interpretation
but
i
believe
that
a
majority
of
the
foresters
and
physicists
who
have
studied
the
question
are
of
opinion
that
in
many
if
not
in
all
cases
the
destruction
of
the
woods
has
been
followed
by
a
diminution
in
the
annual
quantity
of
rain
and
dew
indeed
it
has
long
been
a
popularly
settled
belief
that
vegetation
and
the
condensation
and
fall
of
atmospheric
moisture
are
reciprocally
necessary
to
each
other
and
even
the
poets
sing
of
afric
barren
sand
where
nought
can
grow
because
it
raineth
not
and
where
no
rain
can
fall
to
bless
the
land
because
nought
grows
there
before
stating
the
evidence
on
the
general
question
and
citing
the
judgments
of
the
learned
upon
it
however
it
is
well
to
remark
that
the
comparative
variety
or
frequency
of
inundations
in
earlier
and
later
centuries
is
not
necessarily
in
most
cases
not
probably
entitled
to
any
weight
whatever
as
a
proof
that
more
or
less
rain
fell
formerly
than
now
because
the
accumulation
of
water
in
the
channel
of
a
river
depends
far
less
upon
the
quantity
of
precipitation
in
its
valley
than
upon
the
rapidity
with
which
it
is
conducted
on
or
under
the
surface
of
the
ground
to
the
central
artery
that
drains
the
basin
but
this
point
will
be
more
fully
discussed
in
a
subsequent
chapter
there
is
another
important
observation
which
may
properly
be
introduced
here
it
is
not
universally
or
even
generally
true
that
the
atmosphere
returns
its
humidity
to
the
local
source
from
which
it
receives
it
the
air
is
constantly
in
motion
howling
tempests
scour
amain
from
sea
to
land
from
land
to
sea
and
therefore
it
is
always
probable
that
the
evaporation
drawn
up
by
the
atmosphere
from
a
given
river
or
sea
or
forest
or
meadow
will
be
discharged
by
precipitation
not
at

it

at
a

of

leagues

the

they
leave
behind

no

to

we

not
whence

we
have
a

rapidly
increasing
acquaintance

the

at

we

we

not
say
where
or
when
the

exhaled
from

on
which
we
float
will
be
condensed
and
fall
whether
it
will
waste
itself
on
a
barren
desert
refresh
upland

descend
in

on
alpine
heights
or
contribute
to
swell

lay

square
miles
of

nor
do
we
know
whether
the
rain
which
feeds
our
brooklets
is
due
to
the
transpiration
from
a
neighboring
forest
or
to
the
evaporation
from
a
sea
if
therefore
it
were
proved
that
the
annual
quantity
of
rain
and
dew
is
now
as
great
on
the
plains
of
castile
for
example
as
it
was
when
they
were
covered
with
the
native
forest
it
would
by
no
means
follow
that
those
woods
did
not
augment
the
amount
of
precipitation
elsewhere
but
i
return
to
the
question
beginning
with
the
latest
authorities
i
cite
a
passage
from
clavé
after
arguing
that
we
can
not
reason
from
the
climatic
effects
of
the
forest
in
tropical
and
countries
as
to
its
influence
in
temperate
latitudes
the
author
proceeds
the
action
of
the
forests
on
rain
a
consequence
of
that
which
they
exercise
on
temperature
is
difficult
to
estimate
in
our
climate
but
is
very
pronounced
in
hot
countries
and
is
established
by
numerous
examples
boussingault
states
that
in
the
region
comprised
between
the
bay
of
cupica
and
the
gulf
of
guayaquil
which
is
covered
with
immense
forests
the
rains
are
almost
continual
and
that
the
mean
temperature
of
this
humid
country
rises
hardly
to
degrees
blanqui
in
his
in
bulgaria
informs
us
that
at
malta
rain
has
become
so
rare
since
the
woods
were
cleared
to
make
room
for
the
growth
of
cotton
that
at
the
time
of
his
visit
in
october
not
a
drop
of
rain
had
fallen
for
three
years
the
terrible
droughts
which
desolate
the
cape
verd
islands
must
also
be
attributed
to
the
destruction
of
the
forests
in
the
island
of
helena
where
the
wooded
surface
has
considerably
extended
within
a
few
years
it
has
been
observed
that
the
rain
has
increased
in
the
same
proportion
it
is
now
in
quantity
double
what
it
was
during
the
residence
of
napoleon
in
egypt
recent
plantations
have
caused
rains
which
hitherto
were
almost
unknown
schacht
observes
in
wooded
countries
the
atmosphere
is
generally
humid
and
rain
and
dew
fertilize
the
soil
as
the
lightning
rod
abstracts
the
electric
fluid
from
the
stormy
sky
so
the
forest
attracts
to
itself
the
rain
from
the
clouds
which
in
falling
refreshes
not
it
alone
but
extends
its
benefits
to
the
neighboring
fields
the
forest
presenting
a
considerable
surface
for
evaporation
gives
to
its
own
soil
and
to
all
the
adjacent
ground
an
abundant
and
enlivening
dew
there
falls
it
is
true
less
dew
on
a
tall
and
thick
wood
than
on
the
surrounding
meadows
which
being
more
highly
heated
during
the
day
by
the
influence
of
insolation
cool
with
greater
rapidity
by
radiation
but
it
must
be
remarked
that
this
increased
deposition
of
dew
on
the
neighboring
fields
is
partly
due
to
the
forests
themselves
for
the
dense
saturated
strata
of
air
which
hover
over
the
woods
descend
in
cool
calm
evenings
like
clouds
to
the
valley
and
in
the
morning
beads
of
dew
sparkle
on
the
leaves
of
the
grass
and
the
flowers
of
the
field
forests
in
a
word
exert
in
the
interior
of
continents
an
influence
like
that
of
the
sea
on
the
climate
of
islands
and
of
coasts
both
water
the

and
thereby
insure
its

in
a
note
upon
this
passage
quoting
as
authority
the
de
la
conquista
de
las
siete
islas
de
gran
canaria
de
juan
de
abreu
he
adds
old
historians
relate
that
a
celebrated
laurel
in
ferro
formerly
furnished
drinkable
water
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
the
water
flowed
from
its
foliage
uninterruptedly
drop
by
drop
and
was
collected
in
cisterns
every
morning
the
sea
breeze
drove
a
cloud
toward
the
wonderful
tree
which
attracted
it
to
its
huge
top
where
it
was
condensed
to
a
liquid
form
in
a
number
of
the
published
at
boston
the
date
of
which
i
have
mislaid
the
rev
van
lennep
well
known
as
a
competent
observer
gives
the
following
remarkable
account
of
a
similar
fact
witnessed
by
him
in
an
excursion
to
the
east
of
tocat
in
asia
minor
in
this
region
some
feet
above
the
sea
the
trees
are
mostly
oak
and
attain
a
large
size
i
noticed
an
illustration
of
the
influence
of
trees
in
general
in
collecting
moisture
despite
the
fog
of
a
duration
the
ground
was
everywhere
perfectly
dry
the
dry
oak
leaves
however
had
gathered
the
water
and
the
branches
and
trunks
of
the
trees
were
more
or
less
wet
in
many
cases
the
water
had
run
down
the
trunk
and
moistened
the
soil
around
the
roots
of
the
tree
in
two
places
several
trees
had
each
furnished
a
small
stream
of
water
and
these
uniting
had
run
upon
the
road
so
that
travellers
had
to
pass
through
the
mud
although
as
i
said
everywhere
else
the
ground
was
perfectly
dry
moreover
the
collected
moisture
was
not
sufficient
to
drop
directly
from
the
leaves
but
in
every
case
it
ran
down
the
branches
and
trunk
to
the
ground
farther
on
we
found
a
grove
and
at
the
foot
of
each
tree
on
the
north
side
was
a
lump
of
ice
the
water
having
frozen
as
it
reached
the
ground
this
is
a
most
striking
illustration
of
the
acknowledged
influence
of
trees
in
collecting
moisture
and
one
can
not
for
a
moment
doubt
that
the
parched
regions
which
commence
at
sivas
and
extend
in
one
direction
to
the
persian
gulf
and
in
another
to
the
red
sea
were
once
a
fertile
garden
teeming
with
a
prosperous
population
before
the
forests
which
covered
the
hillsides
were
cut
down
before
the
cedar
and
the
fir
tree
were
rooted
up
from
the
sides
of
lebanon
as
we
now
descended
the
northern
side
of
the
watershed
we
passed
through
the
grove
of
walnut
oak
and
black
mulberry
trees
which
shade
the
village
of
oktab
whose
houses
cattle
and
ruddy
children
were
indicative
of
prosperity
coultas
thus
argues
the
ocean
winds
and
woods
may
be
regarded
as
the
several
parts
of
a
grand
distillatory
apparatus
the
sea
is
the
boiler
in
which
vapor
is
raised
by
the
solar
heat
the
winds
are
the
guiding
tubes
which
carry
the
vapor
with
them
to
the
forests
where
a
lower
temperature
prevails
this
naturally
condenses
the
vapor
and
showers
of
rain
are
thus
distilled
from
the
cloud
masses
which
float
in
the
atmosphere
by
the
woods
beneath
them
sir
john
herschel
enumerates
among
the
influences
unfavorable
to
rain
absence
of
vegetation
in
warm
climates
and
especially
of
trees
this
is
no
doubt
continues
he
one
of
the
reasons
of
the
extreme
aridity
of
spain
the
hatred
of
a
spaniard
toward
a
tree
is
proverbial
many
districts
in
france
have
been
materially
injured
by
denudation
earl
of
lovelace
on
climate
etc
and
on
the
other
hand
rain
has
become
more
frequent
in
egypt
since
the
more
vigorous
cultivation
of
the
palm
tree
hohenstein
remarks
with
respect
to
the
temperature
in
the
forest
i
have
already
observed
that
at
certain
times
of
the
day
and
of
the
year
it
is
less
than
in
the
open
field
hence
the
woods
may
in
the
daytime
in
summer
and
toward
the
end
of
winter
tend
to
increase
the
fall
of
rain
but
it
is
otherwise
in
summer
nights
and
at
the
beginning
of
winter
when
there
is
a
higher
temperature
in
the
forest
which
is
not
favorable
to
that
effect
the
wood
is
further
like
the
mountain
a
mechanical
obstruction
to
the
motion
of
rain
clouds
and
as
it
checks
them
in
their
course
it
gives
them
occasion
to
deposit
their
water
these
considerations
render
it
probable
that
the
forest
increases
the
quantity
of
rain
but
they
do
not
establish
the
certainty
of
this
conclusion
because
we
have
no
positive
numerical
data
to
produce
on
the
depression
of
temperature
and
the
humidity
of
the
air
in
the
woods
barth
presents
the
following
view
of
the
subject
the
ground
in
the
forest
as
well
as
the
atmospheric
stratum
over
it
continues
humid
after
the
woodless
districts
have
lost
their
moisture
and
the
air
charged
with
the
humidity
drawn
from
them
is
usually
carried
away
by
the
winds
before
it
has
deposited
itself
in
a
condensed
form
on
the
earth
trees
constantly
transpire
through
their
leaves
a
great
quantity
of
moisture
which
they
partly
absorb
again
by
the
same
organs
while
the
greatest
part
of
their
supply
is
pumped
up
through
their
widely
ramifying
roots
from
considerable
depths
in
the
ground
thus
a
constant
evaporation
is
produced
which
keeps
the
forest
atmosphere
moist
even
in
long
droughts
when
all
other
sources
of
humidity
in
the
forest
itself
are
dried
up
little
is
required
to
compel
the
stratum
of
air
resting
upon
a
wood
to
give
up
its
moisture
which
thus
as
rain
fog
or
dew
is
returned
to
the
forest
the
warm
moist
currents
of
air
which
come
from
other
regions
are
cooled
as
they
approach
the
wood
by
its
less
heated
atmosphere
and
obliged
to
let
fall
the
humidity
with
which
they
are
charged
the
woods
contribute
to
the
same
effect
by
mechanically
impeding
the
motion
of
fog
and
rain
cloud
whose
particles
are
thus
accumulated
and
condensed
to
rain
the
forest
thus
has
a
greater
power
than
the
open
ground
to
retain
within
its
own
limits
already
existing
humidity
and
to
preserve
it
and
it
attracts
and
collects
that
which
the
wind
brings
it
from
elsewhere
and
forces
it
to
deposit
itself
as
rain
or
other
precipitation
in
consequence
of
these
relations
of
the
forest
to
humidity
it
follows
that
wooded
districts
have
both
more
frequent
and
more
abundant
rain
and
in
general
are
more
humid
than
woodless
regions
for
what
is
true
of
the
woods
themselves
in
this
respect
is
true
also
of
their
treeless
neighborhood
which
in
consequence
of
the
ready
mobility
of
the
air
and
its
constant
changes
receives
a
share
of
the
characteristics
of
the
forest
atmosphere
coolness
and
moisture
when
the
districts
stripped
of
trees
have
long
been
deprived
of
rain
and
dew
and
the
grass
and
the
fruits
of
the
field
are
ready
to
wither
the
grounds
which
are
surrounded
by
woods
are
green
and
flourishing
by
night
they
are
refreshed
with
dew
which
is
never
wanting
in
the
moist
air
of
the
forest
and
in
due
season
they
are
watered
by
a
beneficent
shower
or
a
mist
which
rolls
slowly
over
them
asbjörnsen
after
adducing
the
familiar
theoretical
arguments
on
this
point
adds
the
rainless
territories
in
peru
and
north
africa
establish
this
conclusion
and
numerous
other
examples
show
that
woods
exert
an
influence
in
producing
rain
and
that
rain
fails
where
they
are
wanting
for
many
countries
have
by
the
destruction
of
the
forests
been
deprived
of
rain
moisture
springs
and
watercourses
which
are
necessary
for
vegetable
growth
the
narratives
of
travellers
show
the
deplorable
consequences
of
felling
the
woods
in
the
island
of
trinidad
martinique
san
domingo
and
indeed
in
almost
the
entire
west
indian
group
in
palestine
and
many
other
parts
of
asia
and
northern
africa
which
in
ancient
times
were
the
granaries
of
europe
fertile
and
populous
similar
consequences
have
been
experienced
these
lands
are
now
deserts
and
it
is
the
destruction
of
the
forests
alone
which
has
produced
this
desolation
in
southern
france
many
districts
have
from
the
same
cause
become
barren
wastes
of
stone
and
the
cultivation
of
the
vine
and
the
olive
has
suffered
severely
since
the
baring
of
the
neighboring
mountains
since
the
extensive
clearings
between
the
spree
and
the

the
inhabitants
complain
that
the
clover
crop
is
much
less
productive
than

on
the
other

examples
of
the
beneficial
influence
of
planting
and
restoring
the
woods
are
not
wanting
in
scotland
where
many
miles
square
have
been
planted
with
trees
this
effect
has
been
manifest
and
similar
observations
have
been
made
in
several
places
in
southern
france
in
lower

both
at
cairo
and
near

rain
rarely
fell
in
considerable
quantity
for

during

about
it

not
rain
for

months

since

and
even
at

it
rains

more

that

are
no

babinet
in
one
of
his
lectures
cites
the
supposed
fact
of
the
increase
of
rain
in
egypt
in
consequence
of
the
planting
of
trees
and
thus
remarks
upon
it
a
few
years
ago
it
never
rained
in
lower
egypt
the
constant
north
winds
which
almost
exclusively
prevail
there
passed
without
obstruction
over
a
surface
bare
of
vegetation
grain
was
kept
on
the
roofs
in
alexandria
without
being
covered
or
otherwise
protected
from
injury
by
the
atmosphere
but
since
the
making
of
plantations
an
obstacle
has
been
created
which
retards
the
current
of
air
from
the
north
the
air
thus
checked
accumulates
dilates
cools
and
yields
rain
the
forests
of
the
vosges
and
ardennes
produce
the
same
effects
in
the
north
east
of
france
and
send
us
a
great
river
the
meuse
which
is
as
remarkable
for
its
volume
as
for
the
small
extent
of
its
basin
with
respect
to
the
retardation
of
the
atmospheric
currents
and
the
effects
of
that
retardation
one
of
my
illustrious
colleagues
mignet
who
is
not
less
a
profound
thinker
than
an
eloquent
writer
suggested
to
me
that
to
produce
rain
a
forest
was
as
good
as
a
mountain
and
this
is
literally
true
arrives
at
this
conclusion
forests
on
the
one
hand
diminish
evaporation
on
the
other
they
act
on
the
atmosphere
as
refrigerating
causes
the
second
scale
of
the
balance
predominates
over
the
other
for
it
is
established
that
in
wooded
countries
it
rains
oftener
and
that
the
quantity
of
rain
being
equal
they
are
more
humid
boussingault
whose
observations
on
the
drying
up
of
lakes
and
springs
from
the
destruction
of
the
woods
in
tropical
america
have
often
been
cited
as
a
conclusive
proof
that
the
quantity
of
rain
was
thereby
diminished
after
examining
the
question
with
much
care
remarks
in
my
judgment
it
is
settled
that
very
large
clearings
must
diminish
the
annual
fall
of
rain
in
a
country
and
on
a
subsequent
page
he
concludes
that
arguing
from
meteorological
facts
collected
in
the
equinoctial
regions
there
is
reason
to
presume
that
clearings
diminish
the
annual
fall
of
rain
the
same
eminent
author
proposes
series
of
observations
on
the
level
of
natural
lakes
especially
on
those
without
outlet
as
a
means
of
determining
the
increase
or
diminution
of
precipitation
in
their
basins
and
of
course
of
measuring
the
effect
of
clearing
when
such
operations
take
place
within
those
basins
but
it
must
be
observed
that
lakes
without
a
visible
outlet
are
of
very
rare
occurrence
and
besides
where
no
superficial
conduit
for
the
discharge
of
lacustrine
waters
exists
we
can
seldom
or
never
be
sure
that
nature
has
not
provided
subterranean
channels
for
their
escape
indeed
when
we
consider
that
most
earths
and
even
some
rocks
under
great
hydrostatic
pressure
are
freely
permeable
by
water
and
that
fissures
are
frequent
in
almost
all
rocky
strata
it
is
evident
that
we
can
not
know
in
what
proportion
the
depression
of
the
level
of
a
lake
is
to
be
ascribed
to
infiltration
to
percolation
or
to
evaporation
further
we
are
in
general
as
little
able
to
affirm
that
a
given
lake
derives
all
its
water
from
the
fall
of
rain
within
its
geographical
basin
or
that
it
receives
all
the
water
that
falls
in
that
basin
except
what
evaporates
from
the
ground
as
we
are
to
show
that
all
its
superfluous
water
is
carried
off
by
visible
channels
and
by
evaporation
suppose
the
strata
of
the
mountains
on
two
sides
of
a
lake
east
and
west
to
be
tilted
in
the
same
direction
and
that
those
of
the
hill
on
the
east
side
incline
toward
the
lake
those
of
that
on
the
west
side
from
it
in
this
case
a
large
proportion
of
the
rain
which
falls
on
the
eastern
slope
of
the
eastern
hill
may
find
its
way
between
the
strata
to
the
lake
and
an
equally
large
proportion
of
the
precipitation
upon
the
eastern
slope
of
the
western
ridge
may
escape
out
of
the
basin
by
similar
channels
in
such
case
the
clearing
of
the
slopes
of
either
or
both
mountains
while
the
forests
of
the
declivities
remained
intact
might
affect
the
quantity
of
water
received
by
the
lake
and
it
would
always
be
impossible
to
know
to
what
territorial
extent
influences
thus
affecting
the
level
of
a
lake
might
reach
boussingault
admits
that
extensive
clearing
an
alpine
lake
even
at
a
considerable
distance
might
affect
the
level
of
its
waters
how
it
would
produce
this
influence
he
does
not
inform
us
but
as
he
says
nothing
of
the
natural
subterranean
drainage
of
surface
waters
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
he
refers
to
the
supposed
diminution
of
the
quantity
of
rain
from
the
removal
of
the
forest
which
might
manifest
itself
at
a
point
more
elevated
than
the
cause
which
occasioned
it
the
elevation
or
depression
of
the
level
of
natural
lakes
then
can
not
be
relied
upon
as
a
proof
still
less
as
a
measure
of
an
increase
or
diminution
in
the
fall
of
rain
within
their
geographical
basins
resulting
from
the
felling
of
the
woods
which
covered
them
though
such
phenomena
afford
very
strong
presumptive
evidence
that
the
supply
of
water
is
somehow
augmented
or
lessened
the
supply
is
in
most
cases
derived
much
less
from
the
precipitation
which
falls
directly
upon
the
surface
of
lakes
than
from
waters
which
flow
above
or
under
the
ground
around
them
and
which
in
the
latter
case
often
come
from
districts
not
comprised
within
what
superficial
geography
would
regard
as
belonging
to
the
lake
basins
it
is
upon
the
whole
evident
that
the
question
can
hardly
be
determined
except
by
the
comparison
of
pluviometrical
observations
made
at
a
given
station
before
and
after
the
destruction
of
the
woods
such
observations
unhappily
are
scarcely
to
be
found
and
the
opportunity
for
making
them
is
rapidly
passing
away
except
so
far
as
a
converse
series
might
be
collected
in
countries
france
for
example
where
forest
plantation
is
now
going
on
upon
a
large
scale
the
smithsonian
institution
at
washington
is
well
situated
for
directing
the
attention
of
observers
in
the
newer
territory
of
the
united
states
to
this
subject
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
it
will
not
fail
to
avail
itself
of
its
facilities
for
this
purpose
numerous
other
authorities
might
be
cited
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
forests
tend
at
least
in
certain
latitudes
and
at
certain
seasons
to
produce
rain
but
though
the
arguments
of
the
advocates
of
this
doctrine
are
very
plausible
not
to
say
convincing
their
opinions
are
rather
conclusions
from
general
meteorological
laws
than
deductions
from
facts
of
observation
and
it
is
remarkable
that
there
is
so
little
direct
evidence
on
the
subject
on
the
other
hand
foissac
expresses
the
opinion
that
forests
have
no
influence
on
precipitation
beyond
that
of
promoting
the
deposit
of
dew
in
their
vicinity
and
he
states
as
a
fact
of
experience
that
the
planting
of
large
vegetables
and
especially
of
trees
is
a
very
efficient
means
of
drying
morasses
because
the
plants
draw
from
the
earth
a
quantity
of
water
larger
than
the
average
annual
fall
of
rain
klöden
admitting
that
the
rivers
oder
and
elbe
have
diminished
in
quantity
of
water
the
former
since
the
latter
since
denies
that
the
diminution
of
volume
is
to
be
ascribed
to
a
decrease
of
precipitation
in
consequence
of
the
felling
of
the
forests
and
states
what
other
physicists
confirm
that
during
the
same
period
meteorological
records
in
various
parts
of
europe
show
rather
an
augmentation
than
a
reduction
of
rain
the
observations
of
belgrand
tend
to
show
contrary
to
the
general
opinion
that
less
rain
falls
in
wooded
than
in
denuded
districts
he
compared
the
precipitation
for
the
year
at
vezelay
in
the
valley
of
the

and
at

in
the

the

it
is
stated
that
the
only
difference
in
their
geographical
conditions
consists
in
the
different
proportions
of
forest
and
cultivated
country
around
them
the
basin
of
the
bouchat
being
entirely
bare
while
that
of
the
grenetière
is
well
wooded
observations
in
the
same

considered
with

to
the

these
observations
so
far
as
they
go
seem
to
show
that
more
rain
falls
in
cleared
than
in
wooded
countries
but
this
result
is
so
contrary
to
what
has
been
generally
accepted
as
a
theoretical
conclusion
that
further
experiment
is
required
to
determine
the
question
becquerel
whose
treatise
on
the
climatic
effects
of
the
destruction
of
the
forest
is
the
fullest
general
discussion
of
that
subject
known
to
me
does
not
examine
this
particular
point
and
as
in
the
summary
of
the
results
of
his
investigations
he
does
not
ascribe
to
the
forest
any
influence
upon
precipitation
the
presumption
is
that
he
rejects
the
doctrine
of
its
importance
as
an
agent
in
producing
the
fall
of
rain
the
effect
of
the
forest
on
precipitation
then
is
not
entirely
free
from
doubt
and
we
can
not
positively
affirm
that
the
total
annual
quantity
of
rain
is
diminished
or
increased
by
the
destruction
of
the
woods
though
both
theoretical
considerations
and
the
balance
of
testimony
strongly
favor
the
opinion
that
more
rain
falls
in
wooded
than
in
open
countries
one
important
conclusion
at
least
upon
the
meteorological
influence
of
forests
is
certain
and
undisputed
the
proposition
namely
that
within
their
own
limits
and
near
their
own
borders
they
maintain
a
more
uniform
degree
of
humidity
in
the
atmosphere
than
is
observed
in
cleared
grounds
scarcely
less
can
it
be
questioned
that
they
promote
the
frequency
of
showers
and
if
they
do
not
augment
the
amount
of
precipitation
they
equalize
its
distribution
through
the
different
seasons
of
the
forest
on
the
humidity
of
the
i
have
hitherto
confined
myself
to
the
influence
of
the
forest
on
meteorological
conditions
a
subject
as
has
been
seen
full
of
difficulty
and
uncertainty
its
comparative
effects
on
the
temperature
the
humidity
the
texture
and
consistence
the
configuration
and
distribution
of
the
mould
or
arable
soil
and
very
often
of
the
mineral
strata
below
and
on
the
permanence
and
regularity
of
springs
and
greater
superficial
watercourses
are
much
less
disputable
as
well
as
more
easily
estimated
and
much
more
important
than
its
possible
value
as
a
cause
of
strictly
climatic
equilibrium
or
disturbance
the
action
of
the
forest
on
the
earth
is
chiefly
mechanical
but
the
organic
process
of
abstraction
of
water
by
its
roots
affects
the
quantity
of
that
fluid
contained
in
the
vegetable
mould
and
in
the
mineral
strata
near
the
surface
and
consequently
the
consistency
of
the
soil
in
treating
of
the
effects
of
trees
on
the
moisture
of
the
atmosphere
i
have
said
that
the
forest
by
interposing
a
canopy
between
the
sky
and
the
ground
and
by
covering
the
surface
with
a
thick
mantle
of
fallen
leaves
at
once
obstructed
insolation
and
prevented
the
radiation
of
heat
from
the
earth
these
influences
go
far
to
balance
each
other
but
familiar
observation
shows
that
in
summer
the
forest
soil
is
not
raised
to
so
high
a
temperature
as
open
grounds
exposed
to
irradiation
for
this
reason
and
in
consequence
of
the
mechanical
resistance
opposed
by
the
bed
of
dead
leaves
to
the
escape
of
moisture
we
should
expect
that
except
after
recent
rains
the
superficial
strata
of
woodland
soil
would
be
more
humid
than
that
of
cleared
land
this
agrees
with
experience
the
soil
of
the
forest
is
always
moist
except
in
the
extremest
droughts
and
it
is
exceedingly
rare
that
a
primitive
wood
suffers
from
want
of
humidity
how
far
this
accumulation
of
water
affects
the
condition
of
neighboring
grounds
by
lateral
infiltration
we
do
not
know
but
we
shall
see
in
a
subsequent
chapter
that
water
is
conveyed
to
great
distances
by
this
process
and
we
may
hence
infer
that
the
influence
in
question
is
an
important
one
of
the
forest
on
the
flow
of
it
is
well
established
that
the
protection
afforded
by
the
forest
against
the
escape
of
moisture
from
its
soil
insures
the
permanence
and
regularity
of
natural
springs
not
only
within
the
limits
of
the
wood
but
at
some
distance
beyond
its
borders
and
thus
contributes
to
the
supply
of
an
element
essential
to
both
vegetable
and
animal
life
as
the
forests
are
destroyed
the
springs
which
flowed
from
the
woods
and
consequently
the
greater
watercourses
fed
by
them
diminish
both
in
number
and
in
volume
this
fact
is
so
familiar
throughout
the
american
states
and
the
british
provinces
that
there
are
few
old
residents
of
the
interior
of
those
districts
who
are
not
able
to
testify
to
its
truth
as
a
matter
of
personal
observation
my
own
recollection
suggests
to
me
many
instances
of
this
sort
and
i
remember
one
case
where
a
small
mountain
spring
which
disappeared
soon
after
the
clearing
of
the
ground
where
it
rose
was
recovered
about
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
by
simply
allowing
the
bushes
and
young
trees
to
grow
up
on
a
rocky
knoll
not
more
than
half
an
acre
in
extent
immediately
above
it
and
has
since
continued
to
flow
uninterruptedly
the
uplands
in
the
atlantic
states
formerly
abounded
in
sources
and
rills
but
in
many
parts
of
those
states
which
have
been
cleared
for
above
a
generation
or
two
the
hill
pastures
now
suffer
severely
from
drought
and
in
dry
seasons
no
longer
afford
either
water
or
herbage
for
cattle
foissac
indeed
quotes
from
the
elder
pliny
xxxi
a
passage
affirming
that
the
felling
of
the
woods
gives
rise
to
springs
which
did
not
exist
before
because
the
water
of
the
soil
was
absorbed
by
the
trees
and
the
same
meteorologist
declares
as
i
observed
in
treating
of
the
effect
of
the
forest
on
atmospheric
humidity
that
the
planting
of
trees
tends
to
drain
marshy
ground
because
the
roots
absorb
more
water
than
falls
from
the
air
but
pliny
statement
rests
on
very
doubtful
authority
and
foissac
cites
no
evidence
in
support
of
his
own
proposition
in
the
american
states
it
is
always
observed
that
clearing
the
ground
not
only
causes
running
springs
to
disappear
but
dries
up
the
stagnant
pools
and
the
spongy
soils
of
the
low
grounds
the
first
roads
in
those
states
ran
along
the
ridges
when
practicable
because
there
only
was
the
earth
dry
enough
to
allow
of
their
construction
and
for
the
same
reason
the
cabins
of
the
first
settlers
were
perched
upon
the
hills
as
the
forests
have
been
from
time
to
time
removed
and
the
face
of
the
earth
laid
open
to
the
air
and
sun
the
moisture
has
been
evaporated
and
the
removal
of
the
highways
and
of
human
habitations
from
the
bleak
hills
to
the
sheltered
valleys
is
one
of
the
most
agreeable
among
the
many
improvements
which
later
generations
have
witnessed
in
the
interior
of
new
england
and
the
other
northern
states
almost
every
treatise
on
the
economy
of
the
forest
adduces
numerous
facts
in
support
of
the
doctrine
that
the
clearing
of
the
woods
tends
to
diminish
the
flow
of
springs
and
the
humidity
of
the
soil
and
it
might
seem
unnecessary
to
bring
forward
further
evidence
on
this
point
but
the
subject
is
of
too
much
practical
importance
and
of
too
great
philosophical
interest
to
be
summarily
disposed
of
and
it
ought
particularly
to
be
noticed
that
there
is
at
least
one
case
that
of
some
loose
soils
which
when
bared
of
wood
very
rapidly
absorb
and
transmit
to
lower
strata
the
water
they
receive
from
the
atmosphere
as
argued
by
vallès
where
the
removal
of
the
forest
may
increase
the
flow
of
springs
at
levels
below
it
by
exposing
to
the
rain
and
melted
snow
a
surface
more
bibulous
and
at
the
same
time
less
retentive
than
its
original
covering
under
such
circumstances
the
water
of
precipitation
which
had
formerly
flowed
off
without
penetrating
through
the
superficial
layers
of
leaves
upon
the
ground
as
in
very
heavy
showers
it
sometimes
does
or
been
absorbed
by
the
vegetable
mould
and
retained
until
it
was
evaporated
might
descend
through
porous
earth
until
it
meets
an
impermeable
stratum
and
then
be
conducted
along
it
until
finally
at
the
outcropping
of
this
stratum
it
bursts
from
a
hillside
as
a
running
spring
but
such
instances
are
doubtless
too
rare
to
form
a
frequent
or
an
important
exception
to
the
general
law
because
it
is
only
under
very
uncommon
circumstances
that
rain
water
runs
off
over
the
surface
of
forest
ground
instead
of
sinking
into
it
and
very
rarely
the
case
that
such
a
soil
as
has
just
been
supposed
is
covered
by
a
layer
of
vegetable
earth
thick
enough
to
retain
until
it
is
evaporated
all
the
rain
that
falls
upon
it
without
imparting
any
water
to
the
strata
below
it
if
we
look
at
the
point
under
discussion
as
purely
a
question
of
fact
to
be
determined
by
positive
evidence
and
not
by
argument
the
observations
of
boussingault
are
both
in
the
circumstances
they
detail
and
in
the
weight
of
authority
to
be
attached
to
the
testimony
among
the
most
important
yet
recorded
they
are
embodied
in
the
fourth
section
of
the
twentieth
chapter
of
that
writer
and
i
have
already
referred
to
them
on
page
for
another
purpose
the
interest
of
the
question
will
justify
me
in
giving
in
boussingault
own
words
the
facts
and
some
of
the
remarks
with
which
he
accompanies
the
details
of
them
in
many
localities
he
observes
it
has
been
thought
that
within
a
certain
number
of
years
a
sensible
diminution
has
been
perceived
in
the
volume
of
water
of
streams
utilized
as
a
motive
power
at
other
points
there
are
grounds
for
believing
that
rivers
have
become
shallower
and
the
increasing
breadth
of
the
belt
of
pebbles
along
their
banks
seems
to
prove
the
loss
of
a
part
of
their
water
and
finally
abundant
springs
have
almost
dried
up
these
observations
have
been
principally
made
in
valleys
bounded
by
high
mountains
and
it
is
thought
to
have
been
noticed
that
this
diminution
of
the
waters
has
immediately
followed
the
epoch
when
the
inhabitants
have
begun
to
destroy
unsparingly
the
woods
which
were
spread
over
the
face
of
the
land
these
facts
would
indicate
that
where
clearings
have
been
made
it
rains
less
than
formerly
and
this
is
the
generally
received
opinion
but
while
the
facts
i
have
stated
have
been
established
it
has
been
observed
at
the
same
time
that
since
the
clearing
of
the
mountains
the
rivers
and
the
torrents
which
seemed
to
have
lost
a
part
of
their
water
sometimes
suddenly
swell
and
that
occasionally
to
a
degree
which
causes
great
disasters
besides
after
violent
storms
springs
which
had
become
almost
exhausted
have
been
observed
to
burst
out
with
impetuosity
and
soon
after
to
dry
up
again
these
latter
observations
it
will
be
easily
conceived
warn
us
not
to
admit
hastily
the
common
opinion
that
the
felling
of
the
woods
lessens
the
quantity
of
rain
for
not
only
is
it
very
possible
that
the
quantity
of
rain
has
not
changed
but
the
mean
volume
of
running
water
may
have
remained
the
same
in
spite
of
the
appearance
of
drought
presented
by
the
rivers
and
springs
at
certain
periods
of
the
year
perhaps
the
only
difference
would
be
that
the
flow
of
the
same
quantity
of
water
becomes
more
irregular
in
consequence
of
clearing
for
instance
if
the
low
water
of
the
rhone
during
one
part
of
the
year
were
exactly
compensated
by
a
sufficient
number
of
floods
it
would
follow
that
this
river
would
convey
to
the
mediterranean
the
same
volume
of
water
which
it
carried
to
that
sea
in
ancient
times
before
the
period
when
the
countries
near
its
source
were
stripped
of
their
woods
and
when
probably
its
mean
depth
was
not
subject
to
so
great
variations
as
in
our
days
if
this
were
so
the
forests
would
have
this
value
that
of
regulating
of
economizing
in
a
certain
sort
the
drainage
of
the
rain
water
if
running
streams
really
become
rarer
in
proportion
as
clearing
is
extended
it
follows
either
that
the
rain
is
less
abundant
or
that
evaporation
is
greatly
favored
by
a
surface
which
is
no
longer
protected
by
trees
against
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
the
wind
these
two
causes
acting
in
the
same
direction
must
often
be
cumulative
in
their
effects
and
before
we
attempt
to
fix
the
value
of
each
it
is
proper
to
inquire
whether
it
is
an
established
fact
that
running
waters
diminish
on
the
surface
of
a
country
in
which
extensive
clearing
is
going
on
in
a
word
to
examine
whether
an
apparent
fact
has
not
been
mistaken
for
a
real
one
and
here
lies
the
practical
point
of
the
question
for
if
it
is
once
established
that
clearing
diminishes
the
volume
of
streams
it
is
less
important
to
know
to
what
special
cause
this
effect
is
due
i
shall
attach
no
value
except
to
facts
which
have
taken
place
under
the
eye
of
man
as
it
is
the
influence
of
his
labors
on
the
meteorological
condition
of
the
atmosphere
which
i
propose
to
estimate
what
i
am
about
to
detail
has
been
observed
particularly
in
america
but
i
shall
endeavor
to
establish
that
what
i
believe
to
be
true
of
america
would
be
equally
so
for
any
other
continent
one
of
the
most
interesting
parts
of
venezuela
is
no
doubt
the
valley
of
aragua
situated
at
a
short
distance
from
the
coast
and
endowed
from
its
elevation
with
various
climates
and
a
soil
of
unexampled
fertility
its
agriculture
embraces
at
once
the
crops
suited
to
tropical
regions
and
to
europe
wheat
succeeds
well
on
the
heights
of
victoria
bounded
on
the
north
by
the
coast
chain
on
the
south
by
a
system
of
mountains
connected
with
the
llanos
the
valley
is
shut
in
on
the
east
and
the
west
by
lines
of
hills
which
completely
close
it
in
consequence
of
this
singular
configuration
the
rivers
which
rise
within
it
having
no
outlet
to
the
ocean
form
by
their
union
the
beautiful
lake
of
tacarigua
or
valencia
this
lake
according
to
humboldt
is
larger
than
that
of
neufchâtel
it
is
at
an
elevation
of
mètres
english
feet
above
the
sea
and
its
greatest
length
does
not
exceed
two
leagues
and
a
half
seven
english
miles
at
the
time
of
humboldt
visit
to
the
valley
of
aragua
the
inhabitants
were
struck
by
the
gradual
diminution
which
the
lake
had
been
undergoing
for
thirty
years
in
fact
by
comparing
the
descriptions
given
by
historians
with
its
actual
condition
even
making
large
allowance
for
exaggeration
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
level
was
considerably
depressed
the
facts
spoke
for
themselves
oviedo
who
toward
the
close
of
the
sixteenth
century
had
often
traversed
the
valley
of
aragua
says
positively
that
new
valencia
was
founded
in
at
half
a
league
from
the
lake
of
tacarigua
in
humboldt
found
this
city
mètres
english
miles
from
the
shore
the
aspect
of
the
soil
furnished
new
proofs
many
hillocks
on
the
plain
retain
the
name
of
islands
which
they
more
justly
bore
when
they
were
surrounded
by
water
the
ground
laid
bare
by
the
retreat
of
the
lake
was
converted
into
admirable
plantations
of
cotton
bananas
and
sugar
cane
and
buildings
erected
near
the
lake
showed
the
sinking
of
the
water
from

to

in
new

made
their
appearance
an
important
military
point
a
fortress
built
in

the

now
on
a
peninsula
and
finally
on
two
granitic
islands
those
of
cura
and
cabo
blanco
humboldt
observed
among
the
shrubs
some
mètres
above
the
water
fine
sand
filled
with
helicites
these
clear
and
positive
facts
suggested
numerous
explanations
all
assuming
a
subterranean
outlet
which
permitted
the
discharge
of
the
water
to
the
ocean
humboldt
disposed
of
these
hypotheses
and
after
a
careful
examination
of
the
locality
the
distinguished
traveller
did
not
hesitate
to
ascribe
the
diminution
of
the
waters
of
the
lake
to
the
numerous
clearings
which
had
been
made
in
the
valley
of
aragua
within
half
a
century
in
the
valley
of
aragua
possessed
a
population
as
dense
as
that
of
any
of
the
parts
of
france
such
was
the
prosperous
condition
of
this
fine
country
when
humboldt
occupied
the
hacienda
de
cura
years
later
i
explored
the
valley
of
aragua
fixing
my
residence
in
the
little
town
of
maracay
for
some
years
previous
the
inhabitants
had
observed
that
the
waters
of
the
lake
were
no
longer
retiring
but
on
the
contrary
were
sensibly
rising
grounds
not
long
before
occupied
by
plantations
were
submerged
the
islands
of
nuevas
aparecidas
which
appeared
above
the
surface
in
had
again
become
shoals
dangerous
to
navigation
cabrera
a
tongue
of
land
on
the
north
side
of
the
valley
was
so
narrow
that
the
least
rise
of
the
water
completely
inundated
it
a
protracted
north
wind
sufficed
to
flood
the
road
between
maracay
and
new
valencia
the
fears
which
the
inhabitants
of
the
shores
had
so
long
entertained
were
reversed
those
who
had
explained
the
diminution
of
the
lake
by
the
supposition
of
subterranean
channels
were
suspected
of
blocking
them
up
to
prove
themselves
in
the
right
during
the
years
which
had
elapsed
important
political
events
had
occurred
venezuela
no
longer
belonged
to
spain
the
peaceful
valley
of
aragua
had
been
the
theatre
of
bloody
struggles
and
a
war
of
extermination
had
desolated
these
smiling
lands
and
decimated
their
population
at
the
first
cry
of
independence
a
great
number
of
slaves
found
their
liberty
by
enlisting
under
the
banners
of
the
new
republic
the
great
plantations
were
abandoned
and
the
forest
which
in
the
tropics
so
rapidly
encroaches
had
soon
recovered
a
large
proportion
of
the
soil
which
man
had
wrested
from
it
by
more
than
a
century
of
constant
and
painful
labor
at
the
time
of
the
growing
prosperity
of
the
valley
of
aragua
the
principal
affluents
of
the
lake
were
diverted
to
serve
for
irrigation
and
the
rivers
were
dry
for
more
than
six
months
of
the
year
at
the
period
of
my
visit
their
waters
no
longer
employed
flowed
freely
boussingault
proceeds
to
state
that
two
lakes
near
ubate
in
new
granada
at
an
elevation
of
mètres
english
feet
where
there
is
a
constant
temperature
of
to
centigrade
fahrenheit
had
formed
but
one
a
century
before
his
visit
that
the
waters
were
gradually
retiring
and
the
plantations
extending
over
the
abandoned
bed
that
by
inquiry
of
old
hunters
and
by
examination
of
parish
records
he
found
that
extensive
clearings
had
been
made
and
were
still
going
on
he
found
also
that
the
length
of
the
lake
of
fuquené
in
the
same
valley
had
within
two
centuries
been
reduced
from
ten
leagues
to
one
and
a
half
its
breadth
from
three
leagues
to
one
at
the
former
period
timber
was
abundant
and
the
neighboring
mountains
were
covered
to
a
certain
height
with
american
oaks
laurels
and
other
trees
of
indigenous
species
but
at
the
time
of
his
visit
the
mountains
had
been
almost
entirely
stripped
of
their
wood
chiefly
to
furnish
fuel
for
our
author
adds
that
other
cases
similar
to
those
already
detailed
might
be
cited
and
he
proceeds
to
show
by
several
examples
that
the
waters
of
other
lakes
in
the
same
regions
where
the
valleys
had
always
been
bare
of
wood
or
where
the
forests
had
not
been
disturbed
had
undergone
no
change
of
level
boussingault
further
maintains
that
the
lakes
of
switzerland
have
sustained
a
depression
of
level
since
the
too
prevalent
destruction
of
the
woods
and
arrives
at
the
general
conclusion
that
in
countries
where
great
clearings
have
been
made
there
has
most
probably
been
a
diminution
in
the
living
waters
which
flow
upon
the
surface
of
the
ground
this
conclusion
he
further
supports
by
two
examples
one
where
a
fine
spring
at
the
foot
of
a
wooded
mountain
in
the
island
of
ascension
dried
up
when
the
mountain
was
cleared
but
reappeared
when
the
wood
was
replanted
the
other
at
marmato
in
the
province
of
popayan
where
the
streams
employed
to
drive
machinery
were
much
diminished
in
volume
within
two
years
after
the
clearing
of
the
heights
from
which
they
derived
their
supplies
this
latter
is
an
interesting
case
because
although
the
rain
gauges
established
as
soon
as
the
decrease
of
water
began
to
excite
alarm
showed
a
greater
fall
of
rain
for
the
second
year
of
observation
than
the
first
yet
there
was
no
appreciable
increase
in
the
flow
of
the
mill
streams
from
these
cases
the
distinguished
physicist
infers
that
very
restricted
local
clearings
may
diminish
and
even
suppress
springs
and
brooks
without
any
reduction
in
the
total
quantity
of
rain
it
will
have
been
noticed
that
these
observations
with
the
exception
of
the
last
two
cases
do
not
bear
directly
upon
the
question
of
the
diminution
of
springs
by
clearings
but
they
logically
infer
it
from
the
subsidence
of
the
natural
reservoirs
which
springs
once
filled
there
is
however
no
want
of
positive
evidence
on
this
subject
marschand
cites
the
following
instances
before
the
felling
of
the
woods
within
the
last
few
years
in
the
valley
of
the
soulce
the
and
the
little
valley
the
sorne
furnished
a
regular
and
sufficient
supply
of
water
for
the
iron
works
of
unterwyl
which
was
almost
unaffected
by
drought
or
by
heavy
rains
the
sorne
has
now
become
a
torrent
every
shower
occasions
a
flood
and
after
a
few
days
of
fine
weather
the
current
falls
so
low
that
it
has
been
necessary
to
change
the
water
wheels
because
those
of
the
old
construction
are
no
longer
able
to
drive
the
machinery
and
at
last
to
introduce
a
steam
engine
to
prevent
the
stoppage
of
the
works
for
want
of
water
when
the
factory
of
ursanne
was
established
the
river
that
furnished
its
power
was
abundant
long
known
and
tried
and
had
from
time
immemorial
sufficed
for
the
machinery
of
a
previous
factory
afterward
the
woods
near
its
sources
were
cut
the
supply
of
water
fell
off
in
consequence
the
factory
wanted
water
for
half
the
year
and
was
at
last
obliged
to
stop
altogether
the
spring
of
combefoulat
in
the
commune
of
seleate
was
well
known
as
one
of
the
best
in
the
country
it
was
remarkably
abundant
and
sufficient
in
spite
of
the
severest
droughts
to
supply
all
the
fountains
of
the
town
but
as
soon
as
considerable
forests
were
felled
in
martin
and
in
the
valley
of
combefoulat
the
famous
spring
which
lies
below
these
woods
has
become
a
mere
thread
of
water
and
disappears
altogether
in
times
of
drought
the
spring
of
varieux
which
formerly
supplied
the
castle
of
pruntrut
lost
more
than
half
its
water
after
the
clearing
of
varieux
and
rongeoles
these
woods
have
been
replanted
the
young
trees
are
growing
well
and
with
the
woods
the
waters
of
the
spring
are
increasing
the
dog
spring
between
pruntrut
and
bressancourt
has
entirely
vanished
since
the
surrounding
forests
grounds
were
brought
under
cultivation
the
wolf
spring
in
the
commune
of
soubey
furnishes
a
remarkable
example
of
the
influence
of
the
woods
upon
fountains
a
few
years
ago
this
spring
did
not
exist
at
the
place
where
it
now
rises
a
small
thread
of
water
was
observed
after
very
long
rains
but
the
stream
disappeared
with
the
rain
the
spot
is
in
the
middle
of
a
very
steep
pasture
inclining
to
the
south
eighty
years
ago
the
owner
of
the
land
perceiving
that
young
firs
were
shooting
up
in
the
upper
part
of
it
determined
to
let
them
grow
and
they
soon
formed
a
flourishing
grove
as
soon
as
they
were
well
grown
a
fine
spring
appeared
in
place
of
the
occasional
rill
and
furnished
abundant
water
in
the
longest
droughts
for
forty
or
fifty
years
this
spring
was
considered
the
best
in
the
clos
du
doubs
a
few
years
since
the
grove
was
felled
and
the
ground
turned
again
to
a
pasture
the
spring
disappeared
with
the
wood
and
is
now
as
dry
as
it
was
ninety
years
ago
the
influence
of
the
forest
on
springs
says
hummel
is
strikingly
shown
by
an
instance
at
heilbronn
the
woods
on
the
hills
surrounding
the
town
are
cut
in
regular
succession
every
twentieth
year
as
the
annual
cuttings
approach
a
certain
point
the
springs
yield
less
water
some
of
them
none
at
all
but
as
the
young
growth
shoots
up
they
now
more
and
more
freely
and
at
length
bubble
up
again
in
all
their
original
abundance
piper
states
the
following
case
within
about
half
a
mile
of
my
residence
there
is
a
pond
upon
which
mills
have
been
standing
for
a
long
time
dating
back
i
believe
to
the
first
settlement
of
the
town
these
have
been
kept
in
constant
operation
until
within
some
twenty
or
thirty
years
when
the
supply
of
water
began
to
fail
the
pond
owes
its
existence
to
a
stream
which
has
its
source
in
the
hills
which
stretch
some
miles
to
the
south
within
the
time
mentioned
these
hills
which
were
clothed
with
a
dense
forest
have
been
almost
entirely
stripped
of
trees
and
to
the
wonder
and
loss
of
the
mill
owners
the
water
in
the
pond
has
failed
except
in
the
season
of
freshets
and
what
was
never
heard
of
before
the
stream
itself
has
been
entirely
dry
within
the
last
ten
years
a
new
growth
of
wood
has
sprung
up
on
most
of
the
land
formerly
occupied
by
the
old
forest
and
now
the
water
runs
through
the
year
notwithstanding
the
great
droughts
of
the
last
few
years
going
back
from
piper
quotes
from
a
letter
of
william
bryant
the
following
remarks
it
is
a
common
observation
that
our
summers
are
become
drier
and
our
streams
smaller
take
the
cuyahoga
as
an
illustration
fifty
years
ago
large
barges
loaded
with
goods
went
up
and
down
that
river
and
one
of
the
vessels
engaged
in
the
battle
of
lake
erie
in
which
the
gallant
perry
was
victorious
was
built
at
old
portage
six
miles
north
of
albion
and
floated
down
to
the
lake
now
in
an
ordinary
stage
of
the
water
a
canoe
or
skiff
can
hardly
pass
down
the
stream
many
a
boat
of
fifty
tons
burden
has
been
built
and
loaded
in
the
tuscarawas
at
new
portage
and
sailed
to
new
orleans
without
breaking
bulk
now
the
river
hardly
affords
a
supply
of
water
at
new
portage
for
the
canal
the
same
may
be
said
of
other
streams
they
are
drying
up
and
from
the
same
cause
the
destruction
of
our
forests
our
summers
are
growing
drier
and
our
winters
colder
no
observer
has
more
carefully
studied
the
influence
of
the
forest
upon
the
flow
of
the
waters
or
reasoned
more
ably
on
the
ascertained
phenomena
than
cantegril
the
facts
presented
in
the
following
case
communicated
by
him
to
the

for
december
are
as
nearly
conclusive
as
any
single
instance
well
can
be
in
the
territory
of
the
commune
of
labruguière
there
is
a
forest
of
hectares
acres
known
by
the
name
of
the
forest
of
montaut
and
belonging
to
that
commune
it
extends
along
the
northern
slope
of
the
black
mountains
the
soil
is
granitic
the
maximum
altitude
mètres
feet
and
the
inclination
ranges
between
and
to
a
small
current
of
water
the
brook
of
caunan
takes
its
rise
in
this
forest
and
receives
the
waters
of
two
thirds
of
its
surface
at
the
lower
extremity
of
the
wood
and
on
the
stream
are
several
fulleries
each
requiring
a
force
of
eight
to
drive
the
water
wheels
which
work
the
stampers
the
commune
of
labruguière
had
been
for
a
long
time
famous
for
its
opposition
to
forest
laws
trespasses
and
abuses
of
the
right
of
pasturage
had
converted
the
wood
into
an
immense
waste
so
that
this
vast
property
now
scarcely
sufficed
to
pay
the
expense
of
protecting
it
and
to
furnish
the
inhabitants
with
a
meagre
supply
of
fuel
while
the
forest
was
thus
ruined
and
the
soil
thus
bared
the
water
after
every
abundant
rain
made
an
eruption
into
the
valley
brought
down
a
great
quantity
of
pebbles
which
still
clog
the
current
of
the
caunan
the
violence
of
the
floods
was
sometimes
such
that
they
were
obliged
to
stop
the
machinery
for
some
time
during
the
summer
another
inconvenience
was
felt
if
the
dry
weather
continued
a
little
longer
than
usual
the
delivery
of
water
became
insignificant
each
fullery
could
for
the
most
part
only
employ
a
single
set
of
stampers
and
it
was
not
unusual
to
see
the
work
entirely
suspended
after
the
municipal
authority
succeeded
in
enlightening
the
population
as
to
their
true
interests
protected
by
a
more
watchful
supervision
aided
by
replantation
the
forest
has
continued
to
improve
to
the
present
day
in
proportion
to
the
restoration
of
the
forest
the
condition
of
the
manufactories
has
become
less
and
less
precarious
and
the
action
of
the
water
is
completely
modified
for
example
there
are
no
longer
sudden
and
violent
floods
which
make
it
necessary
to
stop
the
machinery
there
is
no
increase
in
the
delivery
until
six
or
eight
hours
after
the
beginning
of
the
rain
the
floods
follow
a
regular
progression
till
they
reach
their
maximum
and
decrease
in
the
same
manner
finally
the
fulleries
are
no
longer
forced
to
suspend
work
in
summer
the
water
is
always
sufficiently
abundant
to
allow
the
employment
of
two
sets
of
stampers
at
least
and
often
even
of
three
this
example
is
remarkable
in
this
respect
that
all
other
circumstances
having
remained
the
same
the
changes
in
the
action
of
the
stream
can
be
attributed
only
to
the
restoration
of
the
forest
changes
which
may
be
thus
summed
up
diminution
of

during

increase
of

forest
in
to
estimate
rightly
the
importance
of
the
forest
as
a
natural
apparatus
for
accumulating
the
water
that
falls
upon
the
surface
and
transmitting
it
to
the
subjacent
strata
we
must
compare
the
condition
and
properties
of
its
soil
with
those
of
cleared
and
cultivated
earth
and
examine
the
consequently
different
action
of
these
soils
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
the
disparity
between
them
is
greatest
in
climates
where
as
in
the
northern
american
states
and
in
the
north
of
europe
the
open
ground
freezes
and
remains
impervious
to
water
during
a
considerable
part
of
the
winter
though
even
in
climates
where
the
earth
does
not
freeze
at
all
the
woods
have
still
an
important
influence
of
the
same
character
the
difference
is
yet
greater
in
countries
which
have
regular
wet
and
dry
seasons
rain
being
very
frequent
in
the
former
period
while
in
the
latter
it
scarcely
occurs
at
all
these
countries
lie
chiefly
in
or
near
the
tropics
but
they
are
not
wanting
in
higher
latitudes
for
a
large
part
of
asiatic
and
even
of
european
turkey
is
almost
wholly
deprived
of
summer
rains
in
the
principal
regions
occupied
by
european
cultivation
and
where
alone
the
questions
discussed
in
this
volume
are
recognized
as
having
at
present
any
practical
importance
rain
falls
at
all
seasons
and
it
is
to
these
regions
that
on
this
point
as
well
as
others
i
chiefly
confine
my
attention
the
influence
of
the
forest
upon
the
waters
of
the
earth
has
been
more
studied
in
france
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
civilized
world
because
that
country
has
in
recent
times
suffered
most
severely
from
the
destruction
of
the
woods
but
in
the
southern
provinces
of
that
empire
where
the
evils
resulting
from
this
cause
are
most
sensibly
felt
the
winters
are
not
attended
with
much
frost
while
in
northern
europe
where
the
winters
are
rigorous
enough
to
freeze
the
ground
to
the
depth
of
some
inches
or
even
feet
a
humid
atmosphere
and
frequent
summer
rains
prevent
the
drying
up
of
the
springs
observed
in
southern
latitudes
when
the
woods
are
gone
for
these
reasons
the
specific
character
of
the
forest
as
a
winter
reservoir
of
moisture
in
countries
with
a
cold
and
dry
atmosphere
has
not
attracted
so
much
attention
in
france
and
northern
europe
as
it
deserves
in
the
united
states
where
an
excessive
climate
renders
that
function
of
the
woods
more
important
in
new
england
irregular
as
the
climate
is
the
first
autumnal
snows
usually
fall
before
the
ground
is
frozen
at
all
or
when
the
frost
extends
at
most
to
the
depth
of
only
a
few
inches
in
the
woods
especially
those
situated
upon
the
elevated
ridges
which
supply
the
natural
irrigation
of
the
soil
and
feed
the
perennial
fountains
and
streams
the
ground
remains
covered
with
snow
during
the
winter
for
the
trees
protect
the
snow
from
blowing
from
the
general
surface
into
the
depressions
and
new
accessions
are
received
before
the
covering
deposited
by
the
first
fall
is
melted
snow
is
of
a
color
unfavorable
for
radiation
but
even
when
it
is
of
considerable
thickness
it
is
not
wholly
impervious
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
for
this
reason
as
well
as
from
the
warmth
of
lower
strata
the
frozen
crust
if
one
has
been
formed
is
soon
thawed
and
does
not
again
fall
below
the
freezing
point
during
the
winter
the
snow
in
contact
with
the
earth
now
begins
to
melt
with
greater
or
less
rapidity
according
to
the
relative
temperature
of
the
earth
and
the
air
while
the
water
resulting
from
its
dissolution
is
imbibed
by
the
vegetable
mould
and
carried
off
by
infiltration
so
fast
that
both
the
snow
and
the
layers
of
leaves
in
contact
with
it
often
seem
comparatively
dry
when
in
fact
the
under
surface
of
the
former
is
in
a
state
of
perpetual
thaw
no
doubt
a
certain
proportion
of
the
snow
is
returned
to
the
atmosphere
by
direct
evaporation
but
in
the
woods
it
is
partially
protected
from
the
action
of
the
sun
and
as
very
little
water
runs
off
in
the
winter
by
superficial
watercourses
except
in
rare
cases
of
sudden
thaw
there
can
be
no
question
that
much
the
greater
part
of
the
snow
deposited
in
the
forest
is
slowly
melted
and
absorbed
by
the
earth
the
quantity
of
snow
that
falls
in
extensive
forests
far
from
the
open
country
has
seldom
been
ascertained
by
direct
observation
because
there
are
few
meteorological
stations
in
such
situations
in
the
northeastern
border
states
of
the
american
union
the
ground
in
the
deep
woods
is
covered
with
snow
four
or
five
months
and
the
proportion
of
water
which
falls
in
snow
does
not
exceed
one
fifth
of
the
total
precipitation
for
the
year
although
in
the
open
grounds
snow
and
ice
are
evaporated
with
great
rapidity
in
clear
weather
even
when
the
thermometer
stands
far
below
the
freezing
point
the
surface
of
the
snow
in
the
woods
does
not
indicate
much
loss
in
this
way
very
small
deposits
of
snowflakes
remain
unevaporated
in
the
forest
for
many
days
after
snow
let
fall
at
the
same
time
in
the
cleared
field
has
disappeared
without
either
a
thaw
to
melt
it
or
a
wind
powerful
enough
to
drift
it
away
even
when
bared
of
their
leaves
the
trees
of
a
wood
obstruct
in
an
important
degree
both
the
direct
action
of
the
rays
on
the
snow
and
the
movement
of
drying
and
thawing
winds
piper
records
the
following
observations
a
body
of
snow
one
foot
in
depth
and
sixteen
feet
square
was
protected
from
the
wind
by
a
tight
board
fence
about
five
feet
high
while
another
body
of
snow
much
more
sheltered
from
the
sun
than
the
first
six
feet
in
depth
and
about
sixteen
feet
square
was
fully
exposed
to
the
wind
when
the
thaw
came
on
which
lasted
about
a
fortnight
the
larger
body
of
snow
was
entirely
dissolved
in
less
than
a
week
while
the
smaller
body
was
not
wholly
gone
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
equal
quantities
of
snow
were
placed
in
vessels
of
the
same
kind
and
capacity
the
temperature
of
the
air
being
seventy
degrees
in
the
one
case
a
constant
current
of
air
was
kept
passing
over
the
open
vessel
while
the
other
was
protected
by
a
cover
the
snow
in
the
first
was
dissolved
in
sixteen
minutes
while
the
latter
had
a
small
unthawed
proportion
remaining
at
the
end
of
minutes
the
snow
in
the
woods
is
protected
in
the
same
way
though
not
literally
to
the
same
extent
as
by
the
fence
in
one
of
these
cases
and
the
cover
in
the
other
little
of
the
winter
precipitation
therefore
is
lost
by
evaporation
and
as
it
slowly
melts
at
bottom
it
is
absorbed
by
the
earth
and
but
a
very
small
quantity
of
water
runs
off
from
the
surface
the
immense
importance
of
the
forest
as
a
reservoir
of
this
stock
of
moisture
becomes
apparent
when
we
consider
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
summer
rain
either
flows
into
the
valleys
and
the
rivers
because
it
falls
faster
than
the
ground
can
imbibe
it
or
if
absorbed
by
the
warm
superficial
strata
is
evaporated
from
them
without
sinking
deep
enough
to
reach
wells
and
springs
which
of
course
depend
very
much
on
winter
rains
and
snows
for
their
entire
supply
this
observation
though
specially
true
of
cleared
and
cultivated
grounds
is
not
wholly
inapplicable
to
the
forest
particularly
when
as
is
too
often
the
case
in
europe
the
underwood
and
the
decaying
leaves
are
removed
the
general
effect
of
the
forest
in
cold
climates
is
to
assimilate
the
winter
state
of
the
ground
to
that
of
wooded
regions
under
softer
skies
and
it
is
a
circumstance
well
worth
noting
that
in
southern
europe
where
nature
has
denied
to
the
earth
a
warm
of
flocculent
snow
she
has
by
one
of
those
compensations
in
which
her
empire
is
so
rich
clothed
the
hillsides
with
umbrella
pines
ilexes
cork
oaks
and
other
trees
of
persistent
foliage
whose
evergreen
leaves
afford
to
the
soil
a
protection
analogous
to
that
which
it
derives
from
snow
in
more
northern
climates
the
water
imbibed
by
the
soil
in
winter
sinks
until
it
meets
a
more
or
less
impermeable
or
a
saturated
stratum
and
then
by
unseen
conduits
slowly
finds
its
way
to
the
channels
of
springs
or
oozes
out
of
the
ground
in
drops
which
unite
in
rills
and
so
all
is
conveyed
to
the
larger
streams
and
by
them
finally
to
the
sea
the
water
in
percolating
through
the
vegetable
and
mineral
layers
acquires
their
temperature
and
is
chemically
affected
by
their
action
but
it
carries
very
little
matter
in
mechanical
suspension
the
process
i
have
described
is
a
slow
one
and
the
supply
of
moisture
derived
from
the
snow
augmented
by
the
rains
of
the
following
seasons
keeps
the
forest
ground
where
the
surface
is
level
or
but
moderately
inclined
in
a
state
of
saturation
through
almost
the
whole
year
the
rivers
fed
by
springs
and
shaded
by
woods
are
comparatively
uniform
in
volume
in
temperature
and
in
chemical
composition
their
banks
are
little
abraded
nor
are
their
courses
much
obstructed
by
fallen
timber
or
by
earth
and
gravel
washed
down
from
the
highlands
their
channels
are
subject
only
to
slow
and
gradual
changes
and
they
carry
down
to
the
lakes
and
the
sea
no
accumulation
of
sand
or
silt
to
fill
up
their
outlets
and
by
raising
their
beds
to
force
them
to
spread
over
the
low
grounds
near
their
mouth
in
this
state
of
things
destructive
tendencies
of
all
sorts
are
arrested
or
compensated
and
tree
bird
beast
and
fish
alike
find
a
constant
uniformity
of
condition
most
favorable
to
the
regular
and
harmonious
coexistence
of
them
all
consequences
of
the
destruction
of
the
with
the
disappearance
of
the
forest
all
is
changed
at
one
season
the
earth
parts
with
its
warmth
by
radiation
to
an
open
sky
receives
at
another
an
immoderate
heat
from
the
unobstructed
rays
of
the
sun
hence
the
climate
becomes
excessive
and
the
soil
is
alternately
parched
by
the
fervors
of
summer
and
seared
by
the
rigors
of
winter
bleak
winds
sweep
unresisted
over
its
surface
drift
away
the
snow
that
sheltered
it
from
the
frost
and
dry
up
its
scanty
moisture
the
precipitation
becomes
as
regular
as
the
temperature
the
melting
snows
and
vernal
rains
no
longer
absorbed
by
a
loose
and
bibulous
vegetable
mould
rush
over
the
frozen
surface
and
pour
down
the
valleys
seaward
instead
of
filling
a
retentive
bed
of
absorbent
earth
and
storing
up
a
supply
of
moisture
to
feed
perennial
springs
the
soil
is
bared
of
its
covering
of

broken
and
loosened
by
the

of
the
fibrous
rootlets
which

together
dried
and
pulverized

and
at
last
exhausted
by
new
combinations
the

of

is
no

a

but
a
dust
heap
and
the

which
the

of
the

swiftly
along

evaporated
and
thus
reduced
in
their
summer
currents
but
swollen
to
raging
torrents
in
autumn
and
in
spring
from
these
causes
there
is
a
constant
degradation
of
the
uplands
and
a
consequent
elevation
of
the
beds
of
watercourses
and
of
lakes
by
the
deposition
of
the
mineral
and
vegetable
matter
carried
down
by
the

the

of
great
rivers
become
unnavigable
their
estuaries
are
choked
up
and
harbors
which
once
sheltered
large
navies
are
shoaled
by
dangerous
sandbars
the
earth
stripped
of
its
vegetable
glebe
grows
less
and
less
productive
and
consequently
less
able
to
protect
itself
by
weaving
a
new
network
of
roots
to
bind
its
particles
together
a
new
carpeting
of
turf
to
shield
it
from

and
scouring
rain
gradually
it
becomes
altogether
barren
the
washing
of
the
soil
from
the
mountains
leaves
bare
ridges
of
sterile
rock
and
the
rich
organic
mould
which
covered
them
now
swept
down
into
the
dank
low
grounds
promotes
a
luxuriance
of
aquatic
vegetation
that
breeds
fever
and
more
insidious
forms
of
mortal
disease
by
its
decay
and
thus
the
earth
is
rendered
no
longer
fit
for
the
habitation
of
man
to
the
general
truth
of
this
sad
picture
there
are
many
exceptions
even
in
countries
of
excessive
climates
some
of
these
are
due
to
favorable
conditions
of

and
of
the
distribution
of

in
many
others
the
evil
consequences
of

improvidence
have
not
yet
been
experienced
only
because
a
sufficient
time
has
not
elapsed
since
the
felling
of

to
develop
themselves
but
the
vengeance
of
nature
for
the
violation
of
her
harmonies
though
slow
is
sure
and
the
gradual
deterioration
of
soil
and
climate
in
such
exceptional
regions
is
as
certain
to
result
from
the
destruction
of
the
woods
as
is
any
natural
effect
to
follow
its
cause
in
the
vast
farrago
of
crudities
which
the
elder
pliny
ambition
of
encyclopædic
attainment
and
his
ready
credulity
have
gathered
together
we
meet
some
judicious
observations
among
these
we
must
reckon
the
remark
with
which
he
accompanies
his
extraordinary
statement
respecting
the
prevention
of
springs
by
the
growth
of
forest
trees
though
as
is
usual
with
him
his
philosophy
is
wrong
destructive
torrents
are
generally
formed
when
hills
are
stripped
of
the
trees
which
formerly
confined
and
absorbed
the
rains
the
absorption
here
referred
to
is
not
that
of
the
soil
but
of
the
roots
which
pliny
supposed
drank
up
the
water
to
feed
the
growth
of
the
trees
although
this
particular
evil
effect
of
too
extensive
clearing
was
so
early
noticed
the
lesson
seems
to
have
been
soon
forgotten
the
legislation
of
the
middle
ages
in
europe
is
full
of
absurd
provisions
concerning
the
forests
which
sovereigns
sometimes
destroyed
because
they
furnished
a
retreat
for
rebels
and
robbers
sometimes
protected
because
they
were
necessary
to
breed
stags
and
boars
for
the
chase
and
sometimes
spared
with
the
more
enlightened
view
of
securing
a
supply
of
timber
and
of
fuel
to
future
generations
it
was
reserved
to
later
ages
to
appreciate
their
geographical
importance
and
it
is
only
in
very
recent
times
only
in
a
few
european
countries
that
the
too
general
felling
of
the
woods
has
been
recognized
as
the
most
destructive
among
the
many
causes
of
the
physical
deterioration
of
the
earth
of
the
forest
and
its
literature
in
different
the
literature
of
the
forest
which
in
england
and
america
has
not
yet
become
sufficiently
extensive
to
be
known
as
a
special
branch
of
authorship
counts
its
thousands
of
volumes
in
germany
italy
and
france
it
is
in
the
latter
country
perhaps
that
the
relations
of
the
woods
to
the
regular
drainage
of
the
soil
and
especially
to
the
permanence
of
the
natural
configuration
of
terrestrial
surface
have
been
most
thoroughly
investigated
on
the
other
hand
the
purely
economical
aspects
of
sylviculture
have
been
most
satisfactorily
expounded
and
that
art
has
been
most
philosophically
discussed
and
most
skilfully
and
successfully
practised
in
germany
the
eminence
of
italian
theoretical
hydrographers
and
the
great
ability
of
italian
hydraulic
engineers
are
well
known
but
the
specific
geographical
importance
of
the
woods
has
not
been
so
clearly
recognized
in
italy
as
in
the
states
bordering
it
on
the
north
and
west
it
is
true
that
the
face
of
nature
has
been
as
completely
revolutionized
by
man
and
that
the
action
of
torrents
has
created
as
wide
and
as
hopeless
devastation
in
that
country
as
in
france
but
in
the
french
empire
the
desolation
produced
by
clearing
the
forests
is
more
recent
has
been
more
suddenly
effected
and
therefore
excites
a
livelier
and
more
general
interest
than
in
italy
where
public
opinion
does
not
so
readily
connect
the
effect
with
its
true
cause
italy
too
from
ancient
habit
employs
little
wood
in
architectural
construction
for
generations
she
has
maintained
no
military
or
commercial
marine
large
enough
to
require
exhaustive
quantities
of
timber
and
the
mildness
of
her
climate
makes
small
demands
on
the
woods
for
fuel
besides
these
circumstances
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
sciences
of
observation
did
not
become
knowledges
of
practical
application
till
after
the
mischief
was
already
mainly
done
and
even
forgotten
in
alpine
italy
while
its
evils
were
just
beginning
to
be
sensibly
felt
in
france
when
the
claims
of
natural
philosophy
as
a
liberal
study
were
first
acknowledged
in
modern
europe
the
former
political
condition
of
the
italian
peninsula
would
have
effectually
prevented
the
adoption
of
a
general
system
of
forest
economy
however
clearly
the
importance
of
a
wise
administration
of
this
great
public
interest
might
have
been
understood
the
woods
which
controlled
and
regulated
the
flow
of
the
river
sources
were
very
often
in
one
jurisdiction
the
plains
to
be
irrigated
or
to
be
inundated
by
floods
and
desolated
by
torrents
in
another
concert
of
action
on
such
a
subject
between
a
multitude
of
jealous
petty
sovereignties
was
obviously
impossible
and
nothing
but
the
union
of
all
the
italian
states
under
a
single
government
can
render
practicable
the
establishment
of
such
arrangements
for
the
conservation
and
restoration
of
the
forests
and
the
regulation
of
the
flow
of
the
waters
as
are
necessary
for
the
full
development
of
the
yet
unexhausted
resources
of
that
fairest
of
lands
and
even
for
the
permanent
maintenance
of
the
present
condition
of
its
physical
geography
the
denudation
of
the
central
and
southern
apennines
and
of
the
italian
declivity
of
the
western
alps
began
at
a
period
of
unknown
antiquity
but
it
does
not
seem
to
have
been
carried
to
a
very
dangerous
length
until
the
foreign
conquests
and
extended
commerce
of
rome
created
a
greatly
increased
demand
for
wood
for
the
construction
of
ships
and
for
military
material
the
eastern
alps
the
western
apennines
and
the
maritime
alps
retained
their
forests
much
later
but
even
here
the
want
of
wood
and
the
injury
to
the
plains
and
the
navigation
of
the
rivers
by
sediment
brought
down
by
the
torrents
led
to
some
legislation
for
the
protection
of
the
forests
by
the
republic
of
venice
in
the
fifteenth
century
by
that
of
genoa
as
early
at
least
as
the
seventeenth
and
marschand
states
that
the
latter
government
passed
laws
requiring
the
proprietors
of
mountain
lands
to
replant
the
woods
these
however
do
not
seem
to
have
been
effectually
enforced
it
is
very
common
in
italy
to
ascribe
to
the
french
occupation
under
the
first
empire
all
the
improvements
and
all
the
abuses
of
recent
times
according
to
the
political
sympathies
of
the
individual
and
the
french
are
often
said
to
have
prostrated
every
forest
which
has
disappeared
within
a
century
but
however
this
may
be
no
energetic
system
of
repression
or
restoration
was
adopted
by
any
of
the
italian
states
after
the
downfall
of
the
empire
and
the
taxes
on
forest
property
in
some
of
them
were
so
burdensome
that
rural
municipalities
sometimes
proposed
to
cede
their
common
woods
to
the
government
without
any
other
compensation
than
the
remission
of
the
taxes
imposed
on
forest
lands
under
such
circumstances
woodlands
would
soon
become
disafforested
and
where
facilities
of
transportation
and
a
good
demand
for
timber
have
increased
the
inducements
to
fell
it
as
upon
the
borders
of
the
mediterranean
the
destruction
of
the
forest
and
all
the
evils
which
attend
it
have
gone
on
at
a
seriously
alarming
rate
it
has
even
been
calculated
that
four
tenths
of
the
area
of
the
ligurian
provinces
have
been
washed
away
or
rendered
incapable
of
cultivation
by
the
felling
of
the
woods
the
damp
and
cold
climate
of
england
requires
the
maintenance
of
household
fires
through
a
large
part
of
the
year
contrivances
for
economizing
fuel
were
of
later
introduction
in
that
country
than
on
the
continent
the
soil
like
the
sky
was
in
general
charged
with
humidity
its
natural
condition
was
unfavorable
for
common
roads
and
the
transportation
of
so
heavy
a
material
as
coal
by
land
from
the
remote
counties
where
alone
it
was
mined
in
the
middle
ages
was
costly
and
difficult
for
all
these
reasons
the
consumption
of
wood
was
large
and
apprehensions
of
the
exhaustion
of
the
forests
were
excited
at
an
early
period
legislation
there
as
elsewhere
proved
ineffectual
to
protect
them
and
many
authors
of
the
sixteenth
century
express
fears
of
serious
evils
from
the
wasteful
economy
of
the
people
in
this
respect
harrison
in
his
curious
chapter
of
woods
and
marishes
in
compilation
complains
of
the
rapid
decrease
of
the
forests
and
adds
howbeit
thus
much
i
dare
affirme
that
if
woods
go
so
fast
to
decaie
in
the
next
hundred
yeere

i

no

than
to
sée
foure
things
in

reformed
that
is
the
want

in

the
couetous

of

of

in

preferment
of

evelyn
silva
the
first
edition
of
which
appeared
in
rendered
an
extremely
important
service
to
the
cause
of
the
woods
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
ornamental
plantations
in
which
england
far
surpasses
all
other
countries
are
in
some
measure
the
fruit
of
enthusiasm
in
england
however
arboriculture
the
planting
and
nursing
of
single
trees
has
until
recently
been
better
understood
than
sylviculture
the
sowing
and
training
of
the
forest
but
this
latter
branch
of
rural
improvement
is
now
pursued
on
a
very
considerable
scale
though
so
far
as
i
know
not
by
the
national
government
influence
of
the
forest
on
besides
the
climatic
question
which
i
have
already
sufficiently
discussed
and
the
obvious
inconveniences
of
a
scanty
supply
of
charcoal
of
fuel
and
of
timber
for
architectural
and
naval
construction
and
for
the
thousand
other
uses
to
which
wood
is
applied
in
rural
and
domestic
economy
and
in
the
various
industrial
processes
of
civilized
life
the
attention
of
french
foresters
and
public
economists
has
been
specially
drawn
to
three
points
namely
the
influence
of
the
forests
on
the
permanence
and
regular
flow
of
springs
or
natural
fountains
on
inundations
by
the
overflow
of
rivers
and
on
the
abrasion
of
soil
and
the
transportation
of
earth
gravel
pebbles
and
even
of
considerable
masses
of
rock
from
higher
to
lower
levels
by
torrents
there
are
however
connected
with
this
general
subject
several
other
topics
of
minor
or
strictly
local
interest
or
of
more
uncertain
character
which
i
shall
have
occasion
more
fully
to
speak
of
hereafter
the
first
of
these
three
principal
subjects
the
influence
of
the
woods
on
springs
and
other
living
waters
has
been
already
considered
and
if
the
facts
stated
in
that
discussion
are
well
established
and
the
conclusions
i
have
drawn
from
them
are
logically
sound
it
would
seem
to
follow
as
a
necessary
corollary
that
the
action
of
the
forest
is
as
important
in
diminishing
the
frequency
and
violence
of
river
floods
as
in
securing
the
permanence
and
equability
of
natural
fountains
for
any
cause
which
promotes
the
absorption
and
accumulation
of
the
water
of
precipitation
by
the
superficial
strata
of
the
soil
to
be
slowly
given
out
by
infiltration
and
percolation
must
by
preventing
the
rapid
flow
of
surface
water
into
the
natural
channels
of
drainage
tend
to
check
the
sudden
rise
of
rivers
and
consequently
the
overflow
of
their
banks
which
constitutes
what
is
called
inundation
the
mechanical
resistance
too
offered
by
the
trunks
of
trees
and
of
undergrowth
to
the
flow
of
water
over
the
surface
tends
sensibly
to
retard
the
rapidity
of
its
descent
down
declivities
and
to
divert
and
divide
streams
which
may
have
already
accumulated
from
smaller
threads
of
water
inundations
are
produced
by
the
insufficiency
of
the
natural
channels
of
rivers
to
carry
off
the
waters
of
their
basins
as
fast
as
those
waters
flow
into
them
in
accordance
with
the
usual
economy
of
nature
we
should
presume
that
she
had
everywhere
provided
the
means
of
discharging
without
disturbance
of
her
general
arrangements
or
abnormal
destruction
of
her
products
the
precipitation
which
she
sheds
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
observation
confirms
this
presumption
at
least
in
the
countries
to
which
i
confine
my
inquiries
for
so
far
as
we
know
the
primitive
conditions
of
the
regions
brought
under
human
occupation
within
the
historical
period
it
appears
that
the
overflow
of
river
banks
was
much
less
frequent
and
destructive
than
at
the
present
day
or
at
least
that
rivers
rose
and
fell
less
suddenly
before
man
had
removed
the
natural
checks
to
the
too
rapid
drainage
of
the
basins
in
which
their
tributaries
originate
the
banks
of
the
rivers
and
smaller
streams
in
the
north
american
colonies
were
formerly
little
abraded
by
the
currents
even
now
the
trees
come
down
almost
to
the
water
edge
along
the
rivers
in
the
larger
forests
of
the
united
states
and
the
surface
of
the
streams
seems
liable
to
no
great
change
in
level
or
in
rapidity
of
current
a
circumstance
almost
conclusive
as
to
the
regularity
of
flow
in
forest
rivers
is
that
they
do
not
form
large
sedimentary
deposits
at
their
points
of
discharge
into
lakes
or
larger
streams
such
accumulations
beginning
or
at
least
advancing
far
more
rapidly
after
the
valleys
are
cleared
in
the
northern
united
states
although
inundations
are
sometimes
produced
in
the
height
of
summer
by
heavy
rains
it
will
be
found
generally
true
that
the
most
rapid
rise
of
the
waters
and
of
course
the
most
destructive
freshets
as
they
are
called
in
america
are
produced
by
the
sudden
dissolution
of
the
snow
before
the
open
ground
is
thawed
in
the
spring
it
frequently
happens
that
a
powerful
thaw
sets
in
after
a
long
period
of
frost
and
the
snow
which
had
been
months
in
accumulating
is
dissolved
and
carried
off
in
a
few
hours
when
the
snow
is
deep
it
to
use
a
popular
expression
takes
the
frost
out
of
the
ground
in
the
woods
and
if
it
lies
long
enough
in
the
fields
also
but
the
heaviest
snows
usually
fall
after
midwinter
and
are
succeeded
by
warm
rains
or
sunshine
which
dissolve
the
snow
on
the
cleared
land
before
it
has
had
time
to
act
upon
the
soil
beneath
it
in
this
case
the
snow
in
the
woods
is
absorbed
as
fast
as
it
melts
by
the
soil
it
has
protected
from
freezing
and
does
not
materially
contribute
to
swell
the
current
of
the
rivers
if
the
mild
weather
in
which
great
snowstorms
usually
occur
does
not
continue
and
become
a
regular
thaw
it
is
almost
sure
to
be
followed
by
drifting
winds
and
the
inequality
with
which
they
distribute
the
snow
leaves
the
ridges
comparatively
bare
while
the
depressions
are
often
filled
with
drifts
to
the
height
of
many
feet
the
knolls
become
frozen
to
a
great
depth
succeeding
partial
thaws
melt
the
surface
snow
and
the
water
runs
down
into
the
furrows
of
ploughed
fields
and
other
artificial
and
natural
hollows
and
then
often
freezes
to
solid
ice
in
this
state
of
things
almost
the
entire
surface
of
the
cleared
land
is
impervious
to
water
and
from
the
absence
of
trees
and
the
general
smoothness
of
the
ground
it
offers
little
mechanical
resistance
to
superficial
currents
if
under
these
circumstances
warm
weather
accompanied
by
rain
occurs
the
rain
and
melted
snow
are
swiftly
hurried
to
the
bottom
of
the
valleys
and
gathered
to
raging
torrents
it
ought
further
to
be
considered
that
though
the
lighter
ploughed
soils
readily
imbibe
a
great
deal
of
water
yet
the
grass
lands
and
all
the
heavy
and
tenacious
earths
absorb
it
in
much
smaller
quantities
and
less
rapidly
than
the
vegetable
mould
of
the
forest
pasture
meadow
and
clayey
soils
taken
together
greatly
predominate
over
the
sandy
ploughed
fields
in
all
large
agricultural
districts
and
hence
even
if
in
the
case
we
are
supposing
the
open
ground
chance
to
have
been
thawed
before
the
melting
of
the
snow
which
covers
it
it
is
already
saturated
with
moisture
or
very
soon
becomes
so
and
of
course
can
not
relieve
the
pressure
by
absorbing
more
water
the
consequence
is
that
the
face
of
the
country
is
suddenly
flooded
with
a
quantity
of
melted
snow
and
rain
equivalent
to
a
fall
of
six
or
eight
inches
of
the
latter
or
even
more
this
runs
unobstructed
to
rivers
often
still
bound
with
thick
ice
and
thus
inundations
of
a
fearfully
devastating
character
are
produced
the
ice
bursts
from
the
hydrostatic
pressure
from
below
or
is
violently
torn
up
by
the
current
and
is
swept
by
the
impetuous
stream
in
large
masses
and
with
resistless
fury
against
banks
bridges
dams
and
mills
erected
near
them
the
bark
of
the
trees
along
the
rivers
is
often
abraded
at
a
height
of
many
feet
above
the
ordinary
water
level
by
cakes
of
floating
ice
which
are
at
last
stranded
by
the
receding
flood
on
meadow
or
ploughland
to
delay
by
their
chilling
influence
the
advent
of
the
tardy
spring
the
surface
of
a
forest
in
its
natural
condition
can
never
pour
forth
such
deluges
of
water
as
flow
from
cultivated
soil
humus
or
vegetable
mould
is
capable
of
absorbing
almost
twice
its
own
weight
of
water
the
soil
in
a
forest
of
deciduous
foliage
is
composed
of
humus
more
or
less
unmixed
to
the
depth
of
several
inches
sometimes
even
of
feet
and
this
stratum
is
usually
able
to
imbibe
all
the
water
possibly
resulting
from
the
snow
which
at
any
one
time
covers
it
but
the
vegetable
mould
does
not
cease
to
absorb
water
when
it
becomes
saturated
for
it
then
gives
off
a
portion
of
its
moisture
to
the
mineral
earth
below
and
thus
is
ready
to
receive
a
new
supply
and
besides
the
bed
of
leaves
not
yet
converted
to
mould
takes
up
and
retains
a
very
considerable
proportion
of
snow
water
as
well
as
of
rain
in
the
warm
climates
of
southern
europe
as
i
have
already
said
the
functions
of
the
forest
so
far
as
the
disposal
of
the
water
of
precipitation
is
concerned
are
essentially
the
same
at
all
seasons
and
are
analogous
to
those
which
it
performs
in
the
northern
united
states
in
summer
hence
in
the
former
countries
the
winter
floods
have
not
the
characteristics
which
mark
them
in
the
latter
nor
is
the
conservative
influence
of
the
woods
in
winter
relatively
so
important
though
it
is
equally
unquestionable
if
the
summer
floods
in
the
united
states
are
attended
with
less
pecuniary
damage
than
those
of
the
loire
and
other
rivers
of
france
the
po
and
its
tributaries
in
italy
the
emme
and
her
sister
torrents
which
devastate
the
valleys
of
switzerland
it
is
partly
because
the
banks
of
american
rivers
are
not
yet
lined
with
towns
their
shores
and
the
bottoms
which
skirt
them
not
yet
covered
with
improvements
whose
cost
is
counted
by
millions
and
consequently
a
smaller
amount
of
property
is
exposed
to
injury
by
inundation
but
the
comparative
exemption
of
the
american
people
from
the
terrible
calamities
which
the
overflow
of
rivers
has
brought
on
some
of
the
fairest
portions
of
the
old
world
is
in
a
still
greater
degree
to
be
ascribed
to
the
fact
that
with
all
our
thoughtless
improvidence
we
have
not
yet
bared
all
the
sources
of
our
streams
not
yet
overthrown
all
the
barriers
which
nature
has
erected
to
restrain
her
own
destructive
energies
let
us
be
wise
in
time
and
profit
by
the
errors
of
our
older
brethren
the
influence
of
the
forest
in
preventing
inundations
has
been
very
generally
recognized
both
as
a
theoretical
inference
and
as
a
fact
of
observation
but
belgrand
and
his
commentator
vallès
have
deduced
an
opposite
result
from
various
facts
of
experience
and
from
scientific
considerations
they
contend
that
the
superficial
drainage
is
more
regular
from
cleared
than
from
wooded
ground
and
that
clearing
diminishes
rather
than
augments
the
intensity
of
inundations
neither
of
these
conclusions
is
warranted
by
their
data
or
their
reasoning
and
they
rest
partly
upon
facts
which
truly
interpreted
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
received
opinions
on
these
subjects
partly
upon
assumptions
which
are
contradicted
by
experience
two
of
these
latter
are
first
that
the
fallen
leaves
in
the
forest
constitute
an
impermeable
covering
of
the
soil
over
not
through
which
the
water
of
rains
and
of
melting
snows
flows
off
and
secondly
that
the
roots
of
trees
penetrate
and
choke
up
the
fissures
in
the
rocks
so
as
to
impede
the
passage
of
water
through
channels
which
nature
has
provided
for
its
descent
to
lower
strata
as
to
the
first
of
these
we
may
appeal
to
familiar
facts
within
the
personal
knowledge
of
every
man
acquainted
with
the
operations
of
sylvan
nature
i
have
before
me
a
letter
from
an
acute
and
experienced
observer
containing
this
paragraph
i
think
that
rain
water
does
not
ever
except
in
very
trifling
quantities
flow
over
the
leaves
in
the
woods
in
summer
or
autumn
water
runs
over
them
only
in
the
spring
when
they
are
pressed
down
smoothly
and
compactly
a
state
in
which
they
remain
only
until
they
are
dry
when
shrinkage
and
the
action
of
the
wind
soon
roughen
the
surface
so
as
effectually
to
stop
by
absorption
all
flow
of
water
i
have
observed
that
when
a
sudden
frost
succeeds
a
thaw
at
the
close
of
the
winter
after
the
snow
has
principally
disappeared
the
water
in
and
between
the
layers
of
leaves
sometimes
freezes
into
a
solid
crust
which
allows
the
flow
of
water
over
it
but
this
occurs
only
in
depressions
and
on
a
very
small
scale
and
the
ice
thus
formed
is
so
soon
dissolved
that
no
sensible
effect
is
produced
on
the
escape
of
water
from
the
general
surface
as
to
the
influence
of
roots
upon
drainage
i
believe
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
independently
of
their
action
as
absorbents
mechanically
promote
it
not
only
does
the
water
of
the
soil
follow
them
downward
but
their
swelling
growth
powerfully
tends
to
enlarge
the
crevices
of
rock
into
which
they
enter
and
as
the
fissures
in
rocks
are
longitudinal
not
mere
circular
orifices
every
line
of
additional
width
gained
by
the
growth
of
roots
within
them
increases
the
area
of
the
crevice
in
proportion
to
its
length
consequently
the
widening
of
a
fissure
to
the
extent
of
one
inch
might
give
an
additional
drainage
equal
to
a
square
foot
of
open
tubing
the
observations
and
reasonings
of
belgrand
and
vallès
though
their
conclusions
have
not
been
accepted
by
many
are
very
important
in
one
point
of
view
these
writers
insist
much
on
the
necessity
of
taking
into
account
in
estimating
the
relations
between
precipitation
and
evaporation
the
abstraction
of
water
from
the
surface
and
surface
currents
by
absorption
and
infiltration
an
element
unquestionably
of
great
value
but
hitherto
much
neglected
by
meteorological
inquirers
who
have
very
often
reasoned
as
if
the
surface
earth
were
either
impermeable
to
water
or
already
saturated
with
it
whereas
in
fact
it
is
a
sponge
always
imbibing
humidity
and
always
giving
it
off
not
by
evaporation
only
but
by
infiltration
and
percolation
the
destructive
effects
of
inundations
considered
simply
as
a
mechanical
power
by
which
life
is
endangered
crops
destroyed
and
the
artificial
constructions
of
man
overthrown
are
very
terrible
thus
far
however
the
flood
is
a
temporary
and
by
no
means
an
irreparable
evil
for
if
its
ravages
end
here
the
prolific
powers
of
nature
and
the
industry
of
man
soon
restore
what
had
been
lost
and
the
face
of
the
earth
no
longer
shows
traces
of
the
deluge
that
had
overwhelmed
it
inundations
have
even
their
compensations
the
structures
they
destroy
are
replaced
by
better
and
more
secure
erections
and
if
they
sweep
off
a
crop
of
corn
they
not
unfrequently
leave
behind
them
as
they
subside
a
fertilizing
deposit
which
enriches
the
exhausted
field
for
a
succession
of
seasons
if
then
the
too
rapid
flow
of
the
surface
waters
occasioned
no
other
evil
than
to
produce
once
in
ten
years
upon
the
average
an
inundation
which
should
destroy
the
harvest
of
the
low
grounds
along
the
rivers
the
damage
would
be
too
inconsiderable
and
of
too
transitory
a
character
to
warrant
the
inconveniences
and
the
expense
involved
in
the
measures
which
the
most
competent
judges
in
many
parts
of
europe
believe
the
respective
governments
ought
to
take
to
obviate
it
action
of
but
the
great
the
irreparable
the
appalling
mischiefs
which
have
already
resulted
and
threaten
to
ensue
on
a
still
more
extensive
scale
hereafter
from
too
rapid
superficial
drainage
are
of
a
properly
geographical
character
and
consist
primarily
in
erosion
displacement
and
transportation
of
the
superficial
strata
vegetable
and
mineral
of
the
integuments
so
to
speak
with
which
nature
has
clothed
the
skeleton
framework
of
the
globe
it
is
difficult
to
convey
by
description
an
idea
of
the
desolation
of
the
regions
most
exposed
to
the
ravages
of
torrent
and
of
flood
and
the
thousands
who
in
these
days
of
travel
are
whirled
by
steam
near
or
even
through
the
theatres
of
these
calamities
have
but
rare
and
imperfect
opportunities
of
observing
the
destructive
causes
in
action
still
more
rarely
can
they
compare
the
past
with
the
actual
condition
of
the
provinces
in
question
and
trace
the
progress
of
their
conversion
from
hills
luxuriant
pasture
grounds
and
abundant
cornfields
and
vineyards
well
watered
by
springs
and
fertilizing
rivulets
to
bald
mountain
ridges
rocky
declivities
and
steep
earth
banks
furrowed
by
deep
ravines
with
beds
now
dry
now
filled
by
torrents
of
fluid
mud
and
gravel
hurrying
down
to
spread
themselves
over
the
plain
and
dooming
to
everlasting
barrenness
the
once
productive
fields
in
traversing
such
scenes
it
is
difficult
to
resist
the
impression
that
nature
pronounced
the
curse
of
perpetual
sterility
and
desolation
upon
these
sublime
but
fearful
wastes
difficult
to
believe
that
they
were
once
and
but
for
the
folly
of
man
might
still
be
blessed
with
all
the
natural
advantages
which
providence
has
bestowed
upon
the
most
favored
climes
but
the
historical
evidence
is
conclusive
as
to
the
destructive
changes
occasioned
by
the
agency
of
man
upon
the
flanks
of
the
alps
the
apennines
the
pyrenees
and
other
mountain
ranges
in
central
and
southern
europe
and
the
progress
of
physical
deterioration
has
been
so
rapid
that
in
some
localities
a
single
generation
has
witnessed
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
melancholy
revolution
it
is
certain
that
a
desolation
like
that
which
has
overwhelmed
many
once
beautiful
and
fertile
regions
of
europe
awaits
an
important
part
of
the
territory
of
the
united
states
and
of
other
comparatively
new
countries
over
which
european
civilization
is
now
extending
its
sway
unless
prompt
measures
are
taken
to
check
the
action
of
destructive
causes
already
in
operation
it
is
vain
to
expect
that
legislation
can
do
anything
effectual
to
arrest
the
progress
of
the
evil
in
those
countries
except
so
far
as
the
state
is
still
the
proprietor
of
extensive
forests
woodlands
which
have
passed
into
private
hands
will
everywhere
be
managed
in
spite
of
legal
restrictions
upon
the
same
economical
principles
as
other
possessions
and
every
proprietor
will
as
a
general
rule
fell
his
woods
unless
he
believes
that
it
will
be
for
his
pecuniary
interest
to
preserve
them
few
of
the
new
provinces
which
the
last
three
centuries
have
brought
under
the
control
of
the
european
race
would
tolerate
any
interference
by
the
power
with
what
they
regard
as
the
most
sacred
of
civil
rights
the
right
namely
of
every
man
to
do
what
he
will
with
his
own
in
the
old
world
even
in
france
whose
people
of
all
european
nations
love
best
to
be
governed
and
are
least
annoyed
by
bureaucratic
supervision
law
has
been
found
impotent
to
prevent
the
destruction
or
wasteful
economy
of
private
forests
and
in
many
of
the
mountainous
departments
of
that
country
man
is
at
this
moment
so
fast
laying
waste
the
face
of
the
earth
that
the
most
serious
fears
are
entertained
not
only
of
the
depopulation
of
those
districts
but
of
enormous
mischiefs
to
the
provinces
contiguous
to
them
the
only
legal
provisions
from
which
anything
is
to
be
hoped
are
such
as
shall
make
it
a
matter
of
private
advantage
to
the
landholder
to
spare
the
trees
upon
his
grounds
and
promote
the
growth
of
the
young
wood
something
may
be
done
by
exempting
standing
forests
from
taxation
and
by
imposing
taxes
on
wood
felled
for
fuel
or
for
timber
something
by
premiums
or
honorary
distinctions
for
judicious
management
of
the
woods
it
would
be
difficult
to
induce
governments
general
or
local
to
make
the
necessary
appropriations
for
such
purposes
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
sound
economy
in
the
end
in
countries
where
there
exist
municipalities
endowed
with
an
intelligent
public
spirit
the
purchase
and
control
of
forests
by
such
corporations
would
often
prove
advantageous
and
in
some
of
the
provinces
of
northern
lombardy
experience
has
shown
that
such
operations
may
be
conducted
with
great
benefit
to
all
the
interests
connected
with
the
proper
management
of
the
woods
in
switzerland
on
the
other
hand
except
in
some
few
cases
where
woods
have
been
preserved
as
a
defence
against
avalanches
the
forests
of
the
communes
have
been
productive
of
little
advantage
to
the
public
interests
and
have
very
generally
gone
to
decay
the
rights
of
pasturage
everywhere
destructive
to
trees
combined
with
toleration
of
trespasses
have
so
reduced
their
value
that
there
is
too
often
nothing
left
that
is
worth
protecting
in
the
canton
of
ticino
the
peasants
have
very
frequently
voted
to
sell
the
town
woods
and
divide
the
proceeds
among
the
corporators
the
sometimes
considerable
sums
thus
received
are
squandered
in
wild
revelry
and
the
sacrifice
of
the
forests
brings
not
even
a
momentary
benefit
to
the
proprietors
it
is
evidently
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
that
the
public
and
especially
land
owners
be
roused
to
a
sense
of
the
dangers
to
which
the
indiscriminate
clearing
of
the
woods
may
expose
not
only
future
generations
but
the
very
soil
itself
fortunately
some
of
the
american
states
as
well
as
the
governments
of
many
european
colonies
still
retain
the
ownership
of
great
tracts
of
primitive
woodland
the
state
of
new
york
for
example
has
in
its
northeastern
counties
a
vast
extent
of
territory
in
which
the
lumberman
has
only
here
and
there
established
his
camp
and
where
the
forest
though
interspersed
with
permanent
settlements
robbed
of
some
of
its
finest
pine
groves
and
often
ravaged
by
devastating
fires
still
covers
far
the
largest
proportion
of
the
surface
through
this
territory
the
soil
is
generally
poor
and
even
the
new
clearings
have
little
of
the
luxuriance
of
harvest
which
distinguishes
them
elsewhere
the
value
of
the
land
for
agricultural
uses
is
therefore
very
small
and
few
purchases
are
made
for
any
other
purpose
than
to
strip
the
soil
of
its
timber
it
has
been
often
proposed
that
the
state
should
declare
the
remaining
forest
the
inalienable
property
of
the
commonwealth
but
i
believe
the
motive
of
the
suggestion
has
originated
rather
in
poetical
than
in
economical
views
of
the
subject
both
these
classes
of
considerations
have
a
real
worth
it
is
desirable
that
some
large
and
easily
accessible
region
of
american
soil
should
remain
as
far
as
possible
in
its
primitive
condition
at
once
a
museum
for
the
instruction
of
the
student
a
garden
for
the
recreation
of
the
lover
of
nature
and
an
asylum
where
indigenous
tree
and
humble
plant
that
loves
the
shade
and
fish
and
fowl
and
beast
may
dwell
and
perpetuate
their
kind
in
the
enjoyment
of
such
imperfect
protection
as
the
laws
of
a
people
jealous
of
restraint
can
afford
them
the
immediate
loss
to
the
public
treasury
from
the
adoption
of
this
policy
would
be
inconsiderable
for
these
lands
are
sold
at
low
rates
the
forest
alone
economically
managed
would
without
injury
and
even
with
benefit
to
its
permanence
and
growth

yield
a
regular
income
larger
than
the
present
value
of
the
fee
the
collateral
advantages
of
the
preservation
of
these
forests
would
be
far
greater
nature
threw
up
those
mountains
and
clothed
them
with
lofty
woods
that
they
might
serve
as
a
reservoir
to
supply
with
perennial
waters
the
thousand
rivers
and
rills
that
are
fed
by
the
rains
and
snows
of
the
adirondacks
and
as
a
screen
for
the
fertile
plains
of
the
central
counties
against
the
chilling
blasts
of
the
north
wind
which
meet
no
other
barrier
in
their
sweep
from
the
arctic
pole
the
climate
of
northern
new
york
even
now
presents
greater
extremes
of
temperature
than
that
of
southern
france
the
long
continued
cold
of
winter
is
far
more
intense
the
short
heats
of
summer
not
less
fierce
than
in
provence
and
hence
the
preservation
of
every
influence
that
tends
to
maintain
an
equilibrium
of
temperature
and
humidity
is
of
cardinal
importance
the
felling
of
the
adirondack
woods
would
ultimately
involve
for
northern
and
central
new
york
consequences
similar
to
those
which
have
resulted
from
the
laying
bare
of
the
southern
and
western
declivities
of
the
french
alps
and
the
spurs
ridges
and
detached
peaks
in
front
of
them
it
is
true
that
the
evils
to
be
apprehended
from
the
clearing
of
the
mountains
of
new
york
may
be
less
in
degree
than
those
which
a
similar
cause
has
produced
in
southern
france
where
the
intensity
of
its
action
has
been
increased
by
the
inclination
of
the
mountain
declivities
and
by
the
peculiar
geological
constitution
of
the
earth
the
degradation
of
the
soil
is
perhaps
not
equally
promoted
by
a
combination
of
the
same
circumstances
in
any
of
the
american
atlantic
states
but
still
they
have
rapid
slopes
and
loose
and
friable
soils
enough
to
render
widespread
desolation
certain
if
the
further
destruction
of
the
woods
is
not
soon
arrested
the
effects
of
clearing
are
already
perceptible
in
the
comparatively
unviolated
region
of
which
i
am
speaking
the
rivers
which
rise
in
it
flow
with
diminished
currents
in
dry
seasons
and
with
augmented
volumes
of
water
after
heavy
rains
they
bring
down
much
larger
quantities
of
sediment
and
the
increasing
obstructions
to
the
navigation
of
the
hudson
which
are
extending
themselves
down
the
channel
in
proportion
as
the
fields
are
encroaching
upon
the
forest
give
good
grounds
for
the
fear
of
serious
injury
to
the
commerce
of
the
important
towns
on
the
upper
waters
of
that
river
unless
measures
are
taken
to
prevent
the
expansion
of
improvements
which
have
already
been
carried
beyond
the
demands
of
a
wise
economy
i
have
stated
in
a
general
way
the
nature
of
the
evils
in
question
and
of
the
processes
by
which
they
are
produced
but
i
shall
make
their
precise
character
and
magnitude
better
understood
by
presenting
some
descriptive
and
statistical
details
of
facts
of
actual
occurrence
i
select
for
this
purpose
the
southeastern
portion
of
france
not
because
that
territory
has
suffered
more
severely
than
some
others
but
because
its
deterioration
is
comparatively
recent
and
has
been
watched
and
described
by
very
competent
and
trustworthy
observers
whose
reports
are
more
easily
accessible
than
those
published
in
other
countries
the
provinces
of
dauphiny
avignon
and
provence
comprise
a
territory
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
thousand
square
miles
bounded
northwest
by
the
isere
northeast
and
east
by
the
alps
south
by
the
mediterranean
west
by
the
rhone
and
extending
from
to
about
of
north
latitude
the
surface
is
generally
hilly
and
even
mountainous
and
several
of
the
peaks
in
dauphiny
rise
above
the
limit
of
perpetual
snow
the
climate
as
compared
with
that
of
the
united
states
in
the
same
latitude
is
extremely
mild
little
snow
falls
except
upon
the
higher
mountain
ranges
the
frosts
are
light
and
the
summers
long
as
might
indeed
be
inferred
from
the
vegetation
for
in
the
cultivated
districts
the
vine
and
the
fig
everywhere
flourish
the
olive
thrives
as
far
north
as
and
upon
the
coast
grow
the
orange
the
lemon
and
the
date
palm
the
forest
trees
too
are
of
southern
type
umbrella
pines
various
species
of
evergreen
oaks
and
many
other
trees
and
shrubs
of
persistent
foliage
characterizing
the
landscape
the
rapid
slope
of
the
mountains
naturally
exposed
these
provinces
to
damage
by
torrents
and
the
romans
diminished
their
injurious
effects
by
erecting
in
the
beds
of
ravines
barriers
of
rocks
loosely
piled
up
which
permitted
a
slow
escape
of
the
water
but
compelled
it
to
deposit
above
the
dikes
the
earth
and
gravel
with
which
it
was
charged
at
a
later
period
the
crusaders
brought
home
from
palestine
with
much
other
knowledge
gathered
from
the
wiser
moslems
the
art
of
securing
the
hillsides
and
making
them
productive
by
terracing
and
irrigation
the
forests
which
covered
the
mountains
secured
an
abundant
flow
of
springs
and
the
process
of
clearing
the
soil
went
on
so
slowly
that
for
centuries
neither
the
want
of
timber
and
fuel
nor
the
other
evils
about
to
be
depicted
were
seriously
felt
indeed
throughout
the
middle
ages
these
provinces
were
well
wooded
and
famous
for
the
fertility
and
abundance
not
only
of
the
low
grounds
but
of
the
hills
such
was
the
state
of
things
at
the
close
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
statistics
of
the
seventeenth
show
that
while
there
had
been
an
increase
of
prosperity
and
population
in
lower
provence
as
well
as
in
the
correspondingly
situated
parts
of
the
other
two
provinces
i
have
mentioned
there
was
an
alarming
decrease
both
in
the
wealth
and
in
the
population
of
upper
provence
and
dauphiny
although
by
the
clearing
of
the
forests
a
great
extent
of
plough
land
and
pasturage
had
been
added
to
the
soil
before
reduced
to
cultivation
it
was
found
in
fact
that
the
augmented
violence
of
the
torrents
had
swept
away
or
buried
in
sand
and
gravel
more
land
than
had
been
reclaimed
by
clearing
and
the
taxes
computed
by
fires
or
habitations
underwent
several
successive
reductions
in
consequence
of
the
gradual
abandonment
of
the
wasted
soil
by
its
starving
occupants
the
growth
of
the
large
towns
on
and
near
the
rhone
and
the
coast
their
advance
in
commerce
and
industry
and
the
consequently
enlarged
demand
for
agricultural
products
ought
naturally
to
have
increased
the
rural
population
and
the
value
of
their
lands
but
the
physical
decay
of
the
uplands
was
such
that
considerable
tracts
were
deserted
altogether
and
in
upper
provence
the
fires
which
in
counted
were
reduced
to
in
to
in
and
to
in
these
facts

take

it
appears
that
after
clearings
in
the
alps
succeeded
by
others
in
the
common
woods
of
the

the
floods
of
the
torrent
var
became
more
formidable
and
had
already
carried
off
much
land
as
early
as
the
clearing
continued
and
more

was
swept
away
in

after
another
destructive
inundation

of
the
inhabitants
emigrated

in

half
of

been
laid
waste

to
the
assembly

the
damage
caused
by
brooks

torrents
it
is
impossible
to
deny
its
extent
upper
provence
is
in
danger
of
total
destruction
and
the
waters
which
lay
it
waste
threaten
also
the
ruin
of
the
most
valuable
grounds
on
the

villages
have
been
almost
submerged
by
torrents
which
formerly

not
even

large

on
the
point
of
destruction
from
the

reported
the
mere
aspect
of

appal

a
miserable
remnant

the
effects
of

half

in
many
communes
seeming
to
have
been
swallowed
up

said
the

of

the
lower

in
present
nothing
but
a
surface
of
stony
tufa
clearing
is
still
going
on
and
the
little
rivulets
are
becoming
torrents
many
communes
have
lost
their
harvests
their
flocks
and
their
houses
by
floods
the
washing
down
of
the
mountains
is
to
be
ascribed
to
the
clearings
and
the
practice
of
burning
them
over
these
complaints
it
will
be
seen
all
date
before
the
revolution
but
the
desolation
they
describe
has
since
advanced
with
still
swifter
steps
surell
whose
valuable
work
sur
les
torrents
des
hautes
published
in
presents
the
most
appalling
picture
of
the
desolations
of
the
torrent
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
careful
studies
of
the
history
and
essential
character
of
this
great
evil
in
speaking
of
the
valley
of
dévoluy
on
page
says
everything
concurs
to
show
that
it
was
anciently
wooded
in
its
peat
bogs
are
found
buried
trunks
of
trees
monuments
of
its
former
vegetation
in
the
framework
of
old
houses
one
sees
enormous
timber
which
is
no
longer
to
be
found
in
the
district
many
localities
now
completely
bare
still
retain
the
name
of
and
one
of
them
is
called
in
old
deeds
black
forest
or
dell
on
account
of
its
dense
woods
these
and
many
other
proofs
confirm
the
local
traditions
which
are
unanimous
on
this
point
there
as
everywhere
in
the
upper
alps
the
clearings
began
on
the
flanks
of
the
mountains
and
were
gradually
extended
into
the
valleys
and
then
to
the
highest
accessible
peaks
then
followed
the
revolution
and
caused
the
destruction
of
the
remainder
of
the
trees
which
had
thus
far
escaped
the
woodman
axe
in
a
note
to
this
passage
the
writer
says
several
persons
have
told
me
that
they
had
lost
flocks
of
sheep
by
straying
in
the
forests
of
mont
auroux
which
covered
the
flanks
of
the
mountain
from
la
cluse
to
agnères
these
declivities
are
now
as
bare
as
the
palm
of
the
hand
the
ground
upon
the
steep
mountains
being
once
bared
of
trees
and
the
underwood
killed
by
the
grazing
of
horned
cattle
sheep
and
goats
every
depression
becomes
a
watercourse
every
storm
says
surell
page
gives
rise
to
a
new
torrent
examples
of
such
are
shown
which
though
not
yet
three
years
old
have
laid
waste
the
finest
fields
of
their
valleys
and
whole
villages
have
narrowly
escaped
being
swept
into
ravines
formed
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
sometimes
the
flood
pours
in
a
sheet

which
are
abandoned
forever
i
can
not
follow
surell
in
his
description
and
classification
of
torrents
and
i
must
refer
the
reader
to
his
instructive
work
for
a
full
exposition
of
the
theory
of
the
subject
in
order
however
to
show
what
a
concentration
of
destructive
energies
may
be
effected
by
felling
the
woods
that
clothe
and
support
the
sides
of
mountain
abysses
i
cite
his
description
of
a
valley
descending
from
the
col
isoard
which
he
calls
a
complete
type
of
a
basin
of
reception
that
is
a
gorge
which
serves
as
a
common
point
of
accumulation
and
discharge
for
the
waters
of
several
lateral
torrents
the
aspect
of
the
monstrous
channel
says
he
is
frightful
within
a
distance
of
less
than
three
kilomètres
one
mile
and
seven
eighths
english
more
than
sixty
torrents
hurl
into
the
depths
of
the
gorge
the
debris
torn
from
its
two
flanks
the
smallest
of
these
secondary
torrents
if
transferred
to
a
fertile
valley
would
be
enough
to
ruin
it
the
eminent
political
economist
blanqui
in
a
memoir
read
before
the
academy
of
moral
and
political
science
on
the
of
november
thus
expresses
himself
important
as
are
the
causes
of
impoverishment
already
described
they
are
not
to
be
compared
to
the
consequences
which
have
followed
from
the
two
inveterate
evils
of
the
alpine
provinces
of
france
the
extension
of
clearing
and
the
ravages
of
torrents
the
most
important
result
of
this
destruction
is
this
that
the
agricultural
capital
or
rather
the
ground
itself
which
in
a
rapidly
increasing
degree
is
daily
swept
away
by
the
waters
is
totally
lost
signs
of
unparalleled
destitution
are
visible
in
all
the
mountain
zone
and
the
solitudes
of
those
districts
are
assuming
an
indescribable
character
of
sterility
and
desolation
the
gradual
destruction
of
the
woods
has
in
a
thousand
localities
annihilated
at
once
the
springs
and
the
fuel
between
grenoble
and
briançon
in
the
valley
of
the
romanche
many
villages
are
so
destitute
of
wood
that
they
are
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
baking
their
bread
with
cowdung
and
even
this
they
can
afford
to
do
but
once
a
year
this
bread
becomes
so
hard
that
it
can
be
cut
only
with
an
axe
and
i
have
myself
seen
a
loaf
of
bread
in
september
at
the
kneading
of
which
i
was
present
the
january
previous
whoever
has
visited
the
valley
of
barcelonette
those
of
embrun
and
of
verdun
and
that
arabia
petræa
of
the
department
of
the
upper
alps
called
dévoluy
knows
that
there
is
no
time
to
lose
that
in
fifty
years
from
this
date
france
will
be
separated
from
savoy
as
egypt
from
syria
by
a
desert
it
deserves
to
be
specially
noticed
that
the
district
here
referred
to
though
now
among
the
most
hopelessly
waste
in
france
was
very
productive
even
down
to
so
late
a
period
as
the
commencement
of
the
french
revolution
arthur
young
writing
in
says
about
barcelonette
and
in
the
highest
parts
of
the
mountains
the
hill
pastures
feed
a
million
of
sheep
besides
large
herds
of
other
cattle
and
he
adds
with
such
a
soil
and
in
such
a
climate
we
are
not
to
suppose
a
country
barren
because
it
is
mountainous
the
valleys
i
have
visited
are
in
general
beautiful
he
ascribes
the
same
character
to
the
provinces
of
dauphiny
provence
and
auvergne
and
though
he
visited
with
the
eye
of
an
attentive
and
practised
observer
many
of
the
scenes
since
blasted
with
the
wild
desolation
described
by
blanqui
the
durance
and
a
part
of
the
course
of
the
loire
are
the
only
streams
he
mentions
as
inflicting
serious
injury
by
their
floods
the
ravages
of
the
torrents
had
indeed
as
we
have
seen
commenced
earlier
in
some
other
localities
but
we
are
authorized
to
infer
that
they
were
in
young
time
too
limited
in
range
and
relatively
too
insignificant
to
require
notice
in
a
general
view
of
the
provinces
where
they
have
now
ruined
so
large
a
proportion
of
the
soil
but
i
resume
my
citations
i
do
not
exaggerate
says
blanqui
when
i
shall
have
finished
my
excursion
and
designated
localities
by
their
names
there
will
rise
i
am
sure
more
than
one
voice
from
the
spots
themselves
to
attest
the
rigorous
exactness
of
this
picture
of
their
wretchedness
i
have
never
seen
its
equal
even
in
the
kabyle
villages
of
the
province
of
constantine
for
there
you
can
travel
on
horseback
and
you
find
grass
in
the
spring
whereas
in
more
than
fifty
communes
in
the
alps
there
is
absolutely
nothing
the
clear
brilliant
alpine

those

the

the

stripped
the

of

than
the
deep

in

have
burst
forth
in

to

the
very
rocks
and
of
the

which

down
penetrate
deeper
and
deeper
into
the

of
the

while
the
beds
of
the
torrents
issuing
from
them
are
sometimes
raised
several
feet
in

by

ten

is
their
aspect
in
dry

but
no
tongue
can
give
an
adequate
description
of
their
devastations
in
one
of
those
sudden
floods
which
resemble
in
almost
none
of
their
phenomena
the
action
of
ordinary
river
water
they
are
now
no

overflowing
brooks
but
real
seas
tumbling
down
in
cataracts
and
rolling
before
them
blocks
of
stone
which
are
hurled
forward
by
the
shock
of
the
waves
like
balls
shot
out
by
the
explosion
of
gunpowder
sometimes
ridges
of
pebbles
are
driven
down
when
the
transporting
torrent
does
not
rise
high
enough
to
show
itself
and
then
the
movement
is
accompanied
with
a
roar
louder
than
the
crash
of
thunder
a
furious
wind
precedes
the
rushing
water
and
announces
its
approach
then
comes
a
violent
eruption
followed
by
a
flow
of
muddy
waves
and
after
a
few
hours
all
returns
to
the
dreary
silence
which
at
periods
of
rest
marks
these
abodes
of
desolation
this
is
but
an
imperfect
sketch
of
this
scourge
of
the
alps
its
devastations
are
increasing
with
the
progress
of
clearing
and
are
every
day
turning
a
portion
of
our
frontier
departments
into
barren
wastes
the
unfortunate
passion
for
clearing
manifested
itself
at
the
beginning
of
the
french
revolution
and
has
much
increased
under
the
pressure
of
immediate
want
it
has
now
reached
an
extreme
point
and
must
be
speedily
checked
or
the
last
inhabitant
will
be
compelled
to
retreat
when
the
last
tree
falls
the
elements
of
destruction
are
increasing
in
violence
rivers
might
be
mentioned
whose
beds
have
been
raised
ten
feet
in
a
single
year
the
devastation
advances
in
geometrical
progression
as
the
higher
slopes
are
bared
of
their
wood
and
ruin
from
above
to
use
the
words
of
a
peasant
to
hasten
the
desolation
below
the
alps
of
provence
present
a
terrible
aspect
in
the
more
equable
climate
of
northern
france
one
can
form
no
conception
of
those
parched
mountain
gorges
where
not
even
a
bush
can
be
found
to
shelter
a
bird
where
at
most
the
wanderer
sees
in
summer
here
and
there
a
withered
lavender
where
all
the
springs
are
dried
up
and
where
a
dead
silence
hardly
broken
by
even
the
hum
of
an
insect
prevails
but
if
a
storm
bursts
forth
masses
of
water
suddenly
shoot
from
the
mountain
heights
into
the
shattered
gulfs
waste
without
irrigating
deluge
without
refreshing
the
soil
they
overflow
in
their
swift
descent
and
leave
it
even
more
seared
than
it
was
from
want
of
moisture
man
at
last
retires
from
the
fearful
desert
and
i
have
the
present
season
found
not
a
living
soul
in
districts
where
i
remember
to
have
enjoyed
hospitality
thirty
years
ago
in
ten
years
after
the
date
of
blanqui
memoir
de
bonville
prefect
of
the
lower
alps
addressed
to
the
government
a
report
in
which
the
following
passages
occur
it
is
certain
that
the
productive
mould
of
the
alps
swept
off
by
the
increasing
violence
of
that
curse
of
the
mountains
the
torrents
is
daily
diminishing
with
fearful
rapidity
all
our
alps
are
wholly
or
in
large
proportion
bared
of
wood
their
soil
scorched
by
the
sun
of
provence
cut
up
by
the
hoofs
of
the
sheep
which
not
finding
on
the
surface
the
grass
they
require
for
their
sustenance
scratch
the
ground
in
search
of
roots
to
satisfy
their
hunger
is
periodically
washed
and
carried
off
by
melting
snows
and
summer
storms
i
will
not
dwell
on
the
effects
of
the
torrents
for
sixty
years
they
have
been
too
often
depicted
to
require
to
be
further
discussed
but
it
is
important
to
show
that
their
ravages
are
daily
extending
the
range
of
devastation
the
bed
of
the
durance
which
now
in
some
places
exceeds
mètres
about
feet
or
a
mile
and
a
quarter
in
width
and
at
ordinary
times
has
a
current
of
water
less
than
mètres
about
feet
wide
shows
something
of
the
extent
of
the
damage
where
ten
years
ago
there
were
still
woods
and
cultivated
grounds
to
be
seen
there
is
now
but
a
vast
torrent
there
is
not
one
of
our
mountains
which
has
not
at
least
one
torrent
and
new
ones
are
daily
forming
an
indirect
proof
of
the
diminution
of
the
soil
is
to
be
found
in
the
depopulation
of
the
country
in
i
reported
to
the
general
council
that
according
to
the
census
of
that
year
the
population
of
the
department
of
the
lower
alps
had
fallen
off
no
less
than
souls
in
the
five
years
between
and
unless
prompt
and
energetic
measures
are
taken
it
is
easy
to
fix
the
epoch
when
the
french
alps
will
be
but
a
desert
the
interval
between
and
will
show
a
further
decrease
of
population
in
the
ministry
will
announce
a
continued
and
progressive
reduction
in
the
number
of
acres
devoted
to
agriculture
every
year
will
aggravate
the
evil
and
in
a
half
century
france
will
count
more
ruins
and
a
department
the
less
time
has
verified
the
predictions
of
de
bonville
the
later
census
returns
show
a
progressive
diminution
in
the
population
of
the
departments
of
the
lower
alps
the
isère
the
drome
ariège
the
upper
and
the
lower
pyrenees
the
lozère
the
ardennes
the
doubs
the
vosges
and
in
short
in
all
the
provinces
formerly
remarkable
for
their
forests
this
diminution
is
not
to
be
ascribed
to
a
passion
for
foreign
emigration
as
in
ireland
and
in
parts
of
germany
and
of
italy
it
is
simply
a
transfer
of
population
from
one
part
of
the
empire
to
another
from
soils
which
human
folly
has
rendered
uninhabitable
by
ruthlessly
depriving
them
of
their
natural
advantages
and
securities
to
provinces
where
the
face
of
the
earth
was
so
formed
by
nature
as
to
need
no
such
safeguards
and
where
consequently
she
preserves
her
outlines
in
spite
of
the
wasteful
improvidence
of
man
highly
colored
as
these
pictures
seem
they
are
not
exaggerated
although
the
hasty
tourist
through
southern
france
and
northern
italy
finding
little
in
his
high
road
experiences
to
justify
them
might
suppose
them
so
the
lines
of
communication
by
locomotive
train
and
diligence
lead
generally
over
safer
ground
and
it
is
only
when
they
ascend
the
alpine
passes
and
traverse
the
mountain
chains
that
scenes
somewhat
resembling
those
just
described
fall
under
the
eye
of
the
ordinary
traveller
but
the
extension
of
the
sphere
of
devastation
by
the
degradation
of
the
mountains
and
the
transportation
of
their
debris
is
producing
analogous
effects
upon
the
lower
ridges
of
the
alps
and
the
plains
which
skirt
them
and
even
now
one
needs
but
an
hour
departure
from
some
great
thoroughfares
to
reach
sites
where
the
genius
of
destruction
revels
as
wildly
as
in
the
most
frightful
of
the
abysses
which
blanqui
has
painted
there
is
one
effect
of
the
action
of
torrents
which
few
travellers
on
the
continent
are
heedless
enough
to
pass
without
notice
i
refer
to
the
elevation
of
the
beds
of
mountain
streams
in
consequence
of
the
deposit
of
the
debris
with
which
they
are
charged
to
prevent
the
spread
of
sand
and
gravel
over
the
fields
and
the
deluging
overflow
of
the
raging
waters
the
streams
are
confined
by
walls
and
embankments
which
are
gradually
built
higher
and
higher
as
the
bed
of
the
torrent
is
raised
so
that
to
reach
a
river
you
ascend
from
the
fields
beside
it
and
sometimes
the
ordinary
level
of
the
stream
is
above
the
streets
and
even
the
roofs
of
the
towns
through
which
it
passes
the
traveller
who
visits
the
depths
of
an
alpine
ravine
observes
the
length
and
width
of
the
gorge
and
the
great
height
and
apparent
solidity
of
the
precipitous
walls
which
bound
it
and
calculates
the
mass
of
rock
required
to
fill
the
vacancy
can
hardly
believe
that
the
humble
brooklet
which
purls
at
his
feet
has
been
the
principal
agent
in
accomplishing
this
tremendous
erosion
closer
observation
will
often
teach
him
that
the
seemingly
unbroken
rock
which
overhangs
the
valley
is
full
of
cracks
and
fissures
and
really
in
such
a
state
of
disintegration
that
every
frost
must
bring
down
tons
of
it
if
he
compute
the
area
of
the
basin
which
finds
here
its
only
discharge
he
will
perceive
that
a
sudden
thaw
of
the
winter
deposit
of
snow
or
one
of
those
terrible
discharges
of
rain
so
common
in
the
alps
must
send
forth
a
deluge
mighty
enough
to
sweep
down
the
largest
masses
of
gravel
and
of
rock
the
simple
measurement
of
the
cubical
contents
of
the
hillock
which
he
climbed
before
he
entered
the
gorge
the
structure
and
composition
of
which
conclusively
show
that
it
must
have
been
washed
out
of
this
latter
by
torrential
action
will
often
account
satisfactorily
for
the
disposal
of
most
of
the
matter
which
once
filled
the
ravine
it
must
further
be
remembered
that
every
inch
of
the
violent
movement
of
the
rocks
is
accompanied
with
crushing
concussion
or
at
least
with
great
abrasion
and
as
you
follow
the
deposit
along
the
course
of
the
waters
which
transport
it
you
find
the
stones
gradually
rounding
off
in
form
and
diminishing
in
size
until
they
pass
successively
into
gravel
sand
impalpable
slime
i
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
all
the
rocky
valleys
of
the
alps
have
been
produced
by
the
action
of
torrents
resulting
from
the
destruction
of
the
forests
all
the
greater
and
many
of
the
smaller
channels
by
which
that
chain
is
drained
owe
their
origin
to
higher
causes
they
are
primitive
fissures
ascribable
to
disruption
in
upheaval
or
other
geological
convulsion
widened
and
scarped
and
often
even
polished
so
to
speak
by
the
action
of
glaciers
during
the
ice
period
and
but
little
changed
in
form
by
running
water
in
later
eras
in
these
valleys
of
ancient
formation
which
extend
into
the
very
heart
of
the
mountains
the
streams
though
rapid
have
lost
the
true
torrential
character
if
indeed
they
ever
possessed
it
their
beds
have
become
approximately
constant
and
their
walls
no
longer
crumble
and
fall
into
the
waters
that
wash
their
bases
the
ravines
of
which
i
have
spoken
are
of
later
date
and
belong
more
properly
to
what
may
be
called
the
crust
of
the
alps
consisting
of
loose
rocks
of
gravel
and
of
earth
strewed
along
the
surface
of
the
great
declivities
of
the
central
ridge
and
accumulated
thickly
between
their
solid
buttresses
but
it
is
on
this
crust
that
the
mountaineer
dwells
here
are
his
forests
here
his
pastures
and
the
ravages
of
the
torrent
both
destroy
his
world
and
convert
it
into
a
source
of
overwhelming
desolation
to
the
plains
below
power
of
an
instance
that
fell
under
my
own
observation
in
will
serve
to
show
something
of
the
eroding
and
transporting
power
of
streams
which
in
these
respects
fall
incalculably
below
the
torrents
of
the
alps
in
a
flood
of
the
ottaquechee
a
small
river
which
flows
through
woodstock
vermont
a
milldam
on
that
stream
burst
and
the
sediment
with
which
the
pond
was
filled
estimated
after
careful
measurement
at
cubic
yards
was
carried
down
by
the
current
between
this
dam
and
the
slack
water
of
another
four
miles
below
the
bed
of
the
stream
which
is
composed
of
pebbles
interspersed
in
a
few
places
with
larger
stones
is
about
feet
wide
though
at
low
water
the
breadth
of
the
current
is
considerably
less
the
sand
and
fine
gravel
were
smoothly
and
evenly
distributed
over
the
bed
to
a
width
of
or
sixty
feet
and
for
a
distance
of
about
two
miles
except
at
two
or
three
intervening
rapids
filled
up
all
the
interstices
between
the
stones
covering
them
to
the
depth
of
nine
or
ten
inches
so
as
to
present
a
regularly
formed
concave
channel
lined
with
sand
and
reducing
the
depth
of
water
in
some
places
from
five
or
six
feet
to
fifteen
or
eighteen
inches
observing
this
deposit
after
the
river
had
subsided
and
become
so
clear
that
the
bottom
could
be
seen
i
supposed
that
the
next
flood
would
produce
an
extraordinary
erosion
of
the
banks
and
some
permanent
changes
in
the
channel
of
the
stream
in
consequence
of
the
elevation
of
the
bed
and
the
filling
up
of
the
spaces
between
the
stones
through
which
formerly
much
water
had
flowed
but
no
such
result
followed
the
spring
freshet
of
the
next
year
entirely
washed
out
the
sand
its
predecessor
had
deposited
carried
it
to
ponds
and
reaches
below
and
left
the
bed
of
the
river
almost
precisely
in
its
former
condition
though
of
course
with
the
slight
displacement
of
the
pebbles
which
every
flood
produces
in
the
channels
of
such
streams
the
pond
though
often
previously
discharged
by
the
breakage
of
the
dam
had
then
been
undisturbed
for
about
years
and
its
contents
consisted
almost
entirely
of
sand
the
rapidity
of
the
current
in
floods
being
such
that
it
would
let
fall
little
lighter
sediment
even
above
an
obstruction
like
a
dam
the
quantity
i
have
mentioned
evidently
bears
a
very
inconsiderable
proportion
to
the
total
erosion
of
the
stream
during
that
period
because
the
wash
of
the
banks
consists
chiefly
of
fine
earth
rather
than
of
sand
and
after
the
pond
was
once
filled
or
nearly
so
even
this
material
could
no
longer
be
deposited
in
it
the
fact
of
the
complete
removal
of
the
deposit
i
have
described
between
the
two
dams
in
a
single
freshet
shows
that
in
spite
of
considerable
obstruction
from
roughness
of
bed
large
quantities
of
sand
may
be
taken
up
and
carried
off
by
streams
of
no
great
rapidity
of
inclination
for
the
whole
descent
of
the
bed
of
the
river
between
the
two
dams
a
distance
of
four
miles
is
but
sixty
feet
or
fifteen
feet
to
the
mile
po
and
its
the
current
of
the
river
po
for
a
considerable
distance
after
its
volume
of
water
is
otherwise
sufficient
for
continuous
navigation
is
too
rapid
for
that
purpose
until
near
piacenza
where
its
velocity
becomes
too
much
reduced
to
transport
great
quantities
of
mineral
matter
except
in
a
state
of
minute
division
its
southern
affluents
bring
down
from
the
apennines
a
large
quantity
of
fine
earth
from
various
geological
formations
while
its
alpine
tributaries
west
of
the
ticino
are
charged
chiefly
with
rock
ground
down
to
sand
or
gravel
the
bed
of
the
river
has
been
somewhat
elevated
by
the
deposits
in
its
channel
though
not
by
any
means
above
the
level
of
the
adjacent
plains
as
has
been
so
often
represented
the
dikes
which
confine
the
current
at
high
water
at
the
same
time
augment
its
velocity
and
compel
it
to
carry
most
of
its
sediment
to
the
adriatic
it
has
therefore
raised
neither
its
own
channel
nor
its
alluvial
shores
as
it
would
have
done
if
it
had
remained
unconfined
but
as
the
surface
of
the
water
in
floods
is
from
six
to
fifteen
feet
above
the
general
level
of
its
banks
the
po
can
at
that
period
receive
no
contributions
of
earth
from
the
washing
of
the
fields
of
lombardy
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
sediment
it
now
deposits
at
its
mouth
descended
from
the
alps
in
the
form
of
rock
though
reduced
by
the
grinding
action
of
the
waters
in
its
passage
seaward
to
the
condition
of
fine
sand
and
often
of
silt
we
know
little
of
the
history
of
the
po
or
of
the
geography
of
the
coast
near
the
point
where
it
enters
the
adriatic
at
any
period
more
than
twenty
centuries
before
our
own
still
less
can
we
say
how
much
of
the
plains
of
lombardy
had
been
formed
by
its
action
combined
with
other
causes
before
man
accelerated
its
levelling
operations
by
felling
the
first
woods
on
the
mountains
whence
its
waters
are
derived
but
we
know
that
since
the
roman
conquest
of
northern
italy
its
deposits
have
amounted
to
a
quantity
which
if
recemented
into
rock
recombined
into
gravel
common
earth
and
vegetable
mould
and
restored
to
the
situations
where
eruption
or
upheaval
originally
placed
or
vegetation
deposited
it
would
fill
up
hundreds
of
deep
ravines
in
the
alps
and
apennines
change
the
plan
and
profile
of
their
chains
and
give
their
southern
and
northern
faces
respectively
a
geographical
aspect
very
different
from
that
they
now
present
ravenna
forty
miles
south
of
the
principal
mouth
of
the
po
was
built
like
venice
in
a
lagoon
and
the
adriatic
still
washed
its
walls
at
the
commencement
of
the
christian
era
the
mud
of
the
po
has
filled
up
the
lagoon
and
ravenna
is
now
four
miles
from
the
sea
the
town
of
adria
which
lies
between
the
po
and
the
adige
at
the
distance
of
some
four
or
five
miles
from
each
was
once
a
harbor
famous
enough
to
have
given
its
name
to
the
adriatic
sea
and
it
was
still
a
seaport
in
the
time
of
augustus
the
combined
action
of
the
two
rivers
has
so
advanced
the
coast
line
that
adria
is
now
about
fourteen
miles
inland
and
in
other
places
the
deposits
made
within
the
same
period
by
these
and
other
neighboring
streams
have
a
width
of
twenty
miles
what
proportion
of
the
earth
with
which
they
are
charged
these
rivers
have
borne
out
into
deep
water
during
the
last
two
thousand
years
we
do
not
know
but
as
they
still
transport
enormous
quantities
as
the
north
adriatic
appears
to
have
shoaled
rapidly
and
as
long
islands
composed
in
great
part
of
fluviatile
deposits
have
formed
opposite
their
mouths
it
must
evidently
have
been
very
great
the
floods
of
the
po
occur
but
once
or
sometimes
twice
in
a
year
at
other
times
its
waters
are
comparatively
limpid
and
seem
to
hold
no
great
amount
of
mud
or
fine
sand
in
mechanical
suspension
but
at
high
water
it
contains
a
large
proportion
of
solid
matter
and
according
to
lombardini
it
annually
transports
to
the
shores
of
the
adriatic
not
less
than
cubic
mètres
or
very
nearly
cubic
yards
which
carries
the
coast
line
out
into
the
sea
at
the
rate
of
more
than
feet
in
a
year
the
depth
of
the
annual
deposit
is
stated
at
eighteen
centimètres
or
rather
more
than
seven
inches
and
it
would
cover
an
area
of
not
much
less
than
ninety
square
miles
with
a
layer
of
that
thickness
the
adige
also
brings
every
year
to
the
adriatic
many
million
cubic
yards
of
alpine
detritus
and
the
contributions
of
the
brenta
from
the
same
source
are
far
from
inconsiderable
the
adriatic
however
receives
but
a
small
proportion
of
the
soil
and
rock
washed
away
from
the
italian
slope
of
the
alps
and
the
northern
declivity
of
the
apennines
by
torrents
nearly
the
whole
of
the
debris
thus
removed
from
the
southern
face
of
the
alps
between
monte
rosa
and
the
sources
of
the
adda
a
length
of
watershed
not
less
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
is
arrested
by
the
still
waters
of
the
lakes
maggiore
and
como
and
some
smaller
lacustrine
reservoirs
and
never
reaches
the
sea
the
po
is
not
continuously
embanked
except
for
the
lower
half
of
its
course
above
piacenza
therefore
it
spreads
and
deposits
sediment
over
a
wide
surface
and
the
water
withdrawn
from
it
for
irrigation
at
lower
points
as
well
as
its
inundations
in
the
occasional
ruptures
of
its
banks
carry
over
the
adjacent
soil
a
large
amount
of
slime
if
we
add
to
the
estimated
annual
deposits
of
the
po
at
its
mouth
the
earth
and
sand
transported
to
the
sea
by
the
adige
the
brenta
and
other
less
important
streams
the
prodigious
mass
of
detritus
swept
into
lago
maggiore
by
the
tosa
the
maggia
and
the
ticino
into
the
lake
of
como
by
the
maira
and
the
adda
into
the
lake
of
garda
by
its
affluents
and
the
yet
vaster
heaps
of
pebbles
gravel
and
earth
permanently
deposited
by
the
torrents
near
their
points
of
eruption
from
mountain
gorges
or
spread
over
the
wide
plains
at
lower
levels
we
may
safely
assume
that
we
have
an
aggregate
of
not
less
than
four
times
the
quantity
carried
to
the
adriatic
by
the
po
or
cubic
yards
of
solid
matter
abstracted
every
year
from
the
italian
alps
and
the
apennines
and
removed
out
of
their
domain
by
the
force
of
running
water
the
present
rate
of
deposit
at
the
mouth
of
the
po
has
continued
since
the
year
the
previous
advance
of
the
coast
after
the
year
having
been
only
one
third
as
rapid
the
great
increase
of
erosion
and
transport
is
ascribed
by
lombardini
chiefly
to
the
destruction
of
the
forests
in
the
basin
of
that
river
and
the
valleys
of
its
tributaries
since
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
we
have
no
data
to
show
the
rate
of
deposit
in
any
given
century
before
the
year
and
it
doubtless
varied
according
to
the
progress
of
population
and
the
consequent
extension
of
clearing
and
cultivation
the
transporting
power
of
torrents
is
greatest
soon
after
their
formation
because
at
that
time
their
points
of
delivery
are
lower
and
of
course
their
general
slope
and
velocity
more
rapid
than
after
years
of
erosion
above
and
deposit
below
have
depressed
the
beds
of
their
mountain
valleys
and
elevated
the
channels
of
their
lower
course
their
eroding
action
also
is
most
powerful
at
the
same
period
both
because
their
mechanical
force
is
then
greatest
and
because
the
loose
earth
and
stones
of
freshly
cleared
forest
ground
are
most
easily
removed
many
of
the
alpine
valleys
west
of
the
ticino
that
of
the
dora
baltea
for
instance
were
nearly
stripped
of
their
forests
in
the
days
of
the
roman
empire
others
in
the
middle
ages
and
of
course
there
must
have
been
at
different
periods
before
the
year
epochs
when
the
erosion
and
transportation
of
solid
matter
from
the
alps
and
the
apennines
were
as
great
as
since
the
year
upon
the
whole
we
shall
not
greatly
err
if
we
assume
that
for
a
period
of
not
less
than
two
thousand
years
the
walls
of
the
basin
of
the
po
the
italian
slope
of
the
alps
and
the
northern
and
northeastern
declivities
of
the
apennines
have
annually
sent
down
into
the
adriatic
the
lakes
and
the
plains
not
less
than
cubic
yards
of
earth
and
disintegrated
rock
we
have
then
an
aggregate
of
cubic
yards
of
such
material
which
allowing
to
the
mountain
surface
in
question
an
area
of
square
yards
would
cover
the
whole
to
the
depth
of
six
yards
there
are
very
large
portions
of
this
area
where
as
we
know
from
ancient
remains
roads
bridges
and
the
like
from
other
direct
testimony
and
from
geological
considerations
very
little
degradation
has
taken
place
within
twenty
centuries
and
hence
the
quantity
to
be
assigned
to
localities
where
the
destructive
causes
have
been
most
active
is
increased
in
proportion
if
this
vast
mass
of
pulverized
rock
and
earth
were
restored
to
the
localities
from
which
it
was
derived
it
certainly
would
not
obliterate
valleys
and
gorges
hollowed
out
by
great
geological
causes
but
it
would
reduce
the
length
and
diminish
the
depth
of
ravines
of
later
formation
modify
the
inclination
of
their
walls
reclothe
with
earth
many
bare
mountain
ridges
essentially
change
the
line
of
junction
between
plain
and
mountain
and
carry
back
a
long
reach
of
the
adriatic
coast
many
miles
to
the
west
it
is
indeed
not
to
be
supposed
that
all
the
degradation
of
the
mountains
is
due
to
the
destruction
of
the
forests
that
the
flanks
of
every
alpine
valley
in
central
europe
below
the
snow
line
were
once
covered
with
earth
and
green
with
woods
but
there
are
not
many
particular
cases
in
which
we
can
with
certainty
or
even
with
strong
probability
affirm
the
contrary
we
can
not
measure
the
share
which
human
action
has
had
in
augmenting
the
intensity
of
causes
of
mountain
degradation
but
we
know
that
the
clearing
of
the
woods
has
in
some
cases
produced
within
two
or
three
generations
effects
as
blasting
as
those
generally
ascribed
to
geological
convulsions
and
has
laid
waste
the
face
of
the
earth
more
hopelessly
than
if
it
had
been
buried
by
a
current
of
lava
or
a
shower
of
volcanic
sand
now
torrents
are
forming
every
year
in
the
alps
tradition
written
records
and
analogy
concur
to
establish
the
belief
that
the
ruin
of
most
of
the
now
desolate
valleys
in
those
mountains
is
to
be
ascribed
to
the
same
cause
and
authentic
descriptions
of
the
irresistible
force
of
the
torrent
show
that
aided
by
frost
and
heat
it
is
adequate
to
level
mont
blanc
and
monte
rosa
themselves
unless
new
upheavals
shall
maintain
their
elevation
it
has
been
contended
that
all
rivers
which
take
their
rise
in
mountains
originated
in
torrents
these
it
is
said
have
lowered
the
summits
by
gradual
erosion
and
with
the
material
thus
derived
have
formed
shoals
in
the
sea
which
once
beat
against
the
cliffs
then
by
successive
deposits
gradually
raised
them
above
the
surface
and
finally
expanded
them
into
broad
plains
traversed
by
gently
flowing
streams
if
we
could
go
back
to
earlier
geological
periods
we
should
find
this
theory
often
verified
and
we
can
not
fail
to
see
that
the
torrents
go
on
at
the
present
hour
depressing
still
lower
the
ridges
of
the
alps
and
the
apennines
raising
still
higher
the
plains
of
lombardy
and
provence
extending
the
coast
still
farther
into
the
adriatic
and
the
mediterranean
reducing
the
inclination
of
their
own
beds
and
the
rapidity
of
their
flow
and
thus
tending
to
become
in
character
there
are
cases
where
torrents
cease
their
ravages
of
themselves
in
consequence
of
some
change
in
the
condition
of
the
basin
where
they
originate
or
of
the
face
of
the
mountain
at
a
higher
level
while
the
plain
or
the
sea
below
remains
in
substantially
the
same
state
as
before
if
a
torrent
rises
in
a
small
valley
containing
no
great
amount
of
earth
and
of
disintegrated
or
loose
rock
it
may
in
the
course
of
a
certain
period
wash
out
all
the
transportable
material
and
if
the
valley
is
then
left
with
solid
walls
it
will
cease
to
furnish
debris
to
be
carried
down
by
floods
if
in
this
state
of
things
a
new
channel
be
formed
at
an
elevation
above
the
head
of
the
valley
it
may
divert
a
part
or
even
the
whole
of
the
rain
water
and
melted
snow
which
would
otherwise
have
flowed
into
it
and
the
once
furious
torrent
now
sinks
to
the
rank
of
a
humble
and
harmless
brooklet
in
traversing
this
department
says
surell
one
often
sees
at
the
outlet
of
a
gorge
a
flattened
hillock
with
a
outline
and
regular
slopes
it
is
the
bed
of
dejection
of
an
ancient
torrent
it
sometimes
requires
long
and
careful
study
to
detect
the
primitive
form
masked
as
it
is
by
groves
of
trees
by
cultivated
fields
and
often
by
houses
but
when
examined
closely
and
from
different
points
of
view
its
characteristic
figure
manifestly
appears
and
its
true
history
can
not
be
mistaken
along
the
hillock
flows
a
streamlet
issuing
from
the
ravine
and
quietly
watering
the
fields
this
was
originally
a
torrent
and
in
the
background
may
be
discovered
its
mountain
basin
such
torrents
if
i
may
use
the
expression
are
numerous
but
for
the
intervention
of
man
and
domestic
animals
these
latter
beneficent
revolutions
would
occur
more
frequently
proceed
more
rapidly
the
new
scarped
mountains
the
hillocks
of
debris
the
plains
elevated
by
sand
and
gravel
spread
over
them
the
shores
freshly
formed
by
fluviatile
deposits
would
clothe
themselves
with
shrubs
and
trees
the
intensity
of
the
causes
of
degradation
would
be
diminished
and
nature
would
thus
regain
her
ancient
equilibrium
but
these
processes
under
ordinary
circumstances
demand
not
years
generations
but
centuries
and
man
who
even
now
finds
scarce
breathing
room
on
this
vast
globe
can
not
retire
from
the
old
world
to
some
yet
undiscovered
continent
and
wait
for
the
slow
action
of
such
causes
to
replace
by
a
new
creation
the
eden
he
has
wasted
i
have
said
that
the
mountainous
regions
of
the
atlantic
states
of
the
american
union
are
exposed
to
similar
ravages
and
i
may
add
that
there
is
in
some
cases
reason
to
apprehend
from
the
same
cause
even
more
appalling
calamities
than
those
which
i
have
yet
described
the
slide
in
the
notch
of
the
white
mountains
by
which
the
willey
family
lost
their
lives
is
an
instance
of
the
sort
i
refer
to
though
i
am
not
able
to
say
that
in
this
particular
case
the
slip
of
the
earth
and
rock
was
produced
by
the
denudation
of
the
surface
it
may
have
been
occasioned
by
this
cause
or
by
the
construction
of
the
road
through
the
notch
the
excavations
for
which
perhaps
cut
through
the
buttresses
that
supported
the
sloping
strata
above
not
to
speak
of
the
fall
of
earth
when
the
roots
which
held
it
together
and
the
bed
of
leaves
and
mould
which
sheltered
it
both
from
disintegrating
frost
and
from
sudden
drenching
and
dissolution
by
heavy
showers
are
gone
it
is
easy
to
see
that
in
a
climate
with
severe
winters
the
removal
of
the
forest
and
consequently
of
the
soil
it
had
contributed
to
form
might
cause
the
displacement
and
descent
of
great
masses
of
rock
the
woods
the
vegetable
mould
and
the
soil
beneath
protect
the
rocks
they
cover
from
the
direct
action
of
heat
and
cold
and
from
the
expansion
and
contraction
which
accompany
them
most
rocks
while
covered
with
earth
contain
a
considerable
quantity
of
water
a
fragment
of
rock
pervaded
with
moisture
cracks
and
splits
if
thrown
into
a
furnace
and
sometimes
with
a
loud
detonation
and
it
is
a
familiar
observation
that
the
fire
in
burning
over
newly
cleared
lands
breaks
up
and
sometimes
almost
pulverizes
the
stones
this
effect
is
due
partly
to
the
unequal
expansion
of
the
stone
partly
to
the
action
of
heat
on
the
water
it
contains
in
its
pores
the
sun
suddenly
let
in
upon
rock
which
had
been
covered
with
moist
earth
for
centuries
produces
more
or
less
disintegration
in
the
same
way
and
the
stone
is
also
exposed
to
chemical
influences
from
which
it
was
sheltered
before
but
in
the
climate
of
the
united
states

of

the

equally
celebrated

into

in
its
fall

sixty
lives
the
rubbish
filled
the
valley
for
a
distance
of
nearly
two
miles
and
by
damming
up
the
waters
of
the
cordevole
formed
a
lake
about
three
miles
long
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
deep
which
still
subsists
though
reduced
to
half
its
original
length
by
the
wearing
down
of
its
outlet
on
the
of
february
the
hill
of
belmonte
a
little
below
the
parish
of
san
stefano
in
tuscany
slid
into
the
valley
of
the
tiber
which
consequently
flooded
the
village
to
the
depth
of
fifty
feet
and
was
finally
drained
off
by
a
tunnel
the
mass
of
debris
is
stated
to
have
been
about
feet
long
wide
and
not
less
than
high
such
displacements
of
earth
and
rocky
strata
rise
to
the
magnitude
of
geological
convulsions
but
they
are
of
so
rare
occurrence
in
countries
still
covered
by
the
primitive
forest
so
common
where
the
mountains
have
been
stripped
of
their
native
covering
and
in
many
cases
so
easily
explicable
by
the
drenching
of
incohesive
earth
from
rain
or
the
free
admission
of
water
between
the
strata
of
rocks
both
of
which
a
coating
of
vegetation
would
have
prevented
that
we
are
justified
in
ascribing
them
for
the
most
part
to
the
same
cause
as
that
to
which
the
destructive
effects
of
mountain
torrents
are
chiefly
due
the
felling
of
the
woods
in
nearly
every
case
of
this
sort
the
circumstances
of
which
are
known
the
immediate
cause
of
the
slip
has
been
either
an
earthquake
the
imbibition
of
water
in
large
quantities
by
bare
earth
or
its
introduction
between
or
beneath
solid
strata
if
water
insinuates
itself
between
the
strata
it
creates
a
sliding
surface
or
it
may
by
its
expansion
in
freezing
separate
beds
of
rock
which
had
been
nearly
continuous
before
widely
enough
to
allow
the
gravitation
of
the
superincumbent
mass
to
overcome
the
resistance
afforded
by
inequalities
of
face
and
by
friction
if
it
finds
its
way
beneath
hard
earth
or
rock
reposing
on
clay
or
other
bedding
of
similar
properties
it
converts
the
supporting
layer
into
a
mud
which
opposes
no
obstacle
to
the
sliding
of
the
strata
above
the
upper
part
of
the
mountain
which
buried
goldau
was
composed
of
a
hard
but
brittle
conglomerate
called
resting
on
an
unctuous
clay
and
inclining
rapidly
toward
the
village
much
earth
remained
upon
the
rock
in
irregular
masses
but
the
woods
had
been
felled
and
the
water
had
free
access
to
the
surface
and
to
the
crevices
which
sun
and
frost
had
already
produced
in
the
rock
and
of
course
to
the
slimy
stratum
beneath
the
whole
summer
of
had
been
very
wet
and
an
almost
incessant
deluge
of
rain
had
fallen
the
day
preceding
the
catastrophe
as
well
as
on
that
of
its
occurrence
all
conditions
then
were
favorable
to
the
sliding
of
the
rock
and
in
obedience
to
the
laws
of
gravitation
it
precipitated
itself
into
the
valley
as
soon
as
its
adhesion
to
the
earth
beneath
it
was
destroyed
by
the
conversion
of
the
latter
into
a
viscous
paste
the
mass
that
fell
measured
between
two
and
a
half
and
three
miles
in
length
by
one
thousand
feet
in
width
and
its
average
thickness
is
thought
to
have
been
about
a
hundred
feet
the
highest
portion
of
the
mountain
was
more
than
three
thousand
feet
above
the
village
and
the
momentum
acquired
by
the
rocks
and
earth
in
their
descent
carried
huge
blocks
of
stone
far
up
the
opposite
slope
of
the
rigi
the
piz
which
fell
into
the
cordevole
rested
on
a
steeply
inclined
stratum
of
limestone
with
a
thin
layer
of
calcareous
marl
intervening
which
by
long
exposure
to
frost
and
the
infiltration
of
water
had
lost
its
original
consistence
and
become
a
loose
and
slippery
mass
instead
of
a
cohesive
and
tenacious
bed
against
fall
of
rocks
and
avalanches
by
forests
often
subserve
a
valuable
purpose
in
preventing
the
fall
of
rocks
by
mere
mechanical
resistance
trees
as
well
as
herbaceous
vegetation
grow
in
the
alps
upon
declivities
of
surprising
steepness
of
inclination
and
the
traveller
sees
both
luxuriant
grass
and
flourishing
woods
on
slopes
at
which
the
soil
in
the
dry
air
of
lower
regions
would
crumble
and
fall
by
the
weight
of
its
own
particles
when
loose
rocks
lie
scattered
on
the
face
of
these
declivities
they
are
held
in
place
by
the
trunks
of
the
trees
and
it
is
very
common
to
observe
a
stone
that
weighs
hundreds
of
pounds
perhaps
even
tons
resting
against
a
tree
which
has
stopped
its
progress
just
as
it
was
beginning
to
slide
down
to
a
lower
level
when
a
forest
in
such
a
position
is
cut
these
blocks
lose
their
support
and
a
single
wet
season
is
enough
not
only
to
bare
the
face
of
a
considerable
extent
of
rock
but
to
cover
with
earth
and
stone
many
acres
of
fertile
soil
below
in
switzerland
and
other
snowy
and
mountainous
countries
forests
render
a
most
important
service
by
preventing
the
formation
and
fall
of
destructive
avalanches
and
in
many
parts
of
the
alps
exposed
to
this
catastrophe
the
woods
are
protected
though
too
often
ineffectually
by
law
no
forest
indeed
could
arrest
a
large
avalanche
once
in
motion
but
the
mechanical
resistance
afforded
by
the
trees
prevents
their
formation
both
by
obstructing
the
wind
which
gives
to
the
dry
snow
of
the
or
dust
avalanche
its
first
impulse
and
by
checking
the
disposition
of
moist
snow
to
gather
itself
into
what
is
called
the
or
sliding
avalanche

that
the

first
winter
after
the
felling
of

on
the

part
of

never
been

the
evil
is
almost
beyond

from

if
the

widens
with

are
buried

the
most
familiar
cause
of
the
destruction
of

for
not
only
does
an
increasing
population
demand
additional
acres
to
grow
the

it

its
domestic
animals
but
the
slovenly
husbandry
of
the
border
settler
soon
exhausts
the
luxuriance
of
his
first
fields
and
compels
him
to
remove
his
household

to
a
fresher
soil
with
growing
numbers
too
come
the
many
arts
for
which
wood
is
the
material
the
demands
of
the
near
and
the
distant
market
for
this
product
excite
the
cupidity
of
the
hardy
forester
and
a
few
years
of
that
wild
industry
of
which
springer
forest
life
and
forest
trees
so
vividly
depicts
the
dangers
and
the
triumphs
suffice
to
rob
the
most
inaccessible

of

in
almost
geometrical

this
is
a
fortunate
circumstance
for
the
remainder
of

for
the
impatient
lumberman
contents
himself
with
felling
a
few
of
the
best

hurries
on
to
take

the
operations

dangers
to

the
loss
of
the

felled
by
him
the

sometimes
occasion

are
some
of

injurious
to

the
escape
and

of

however
is
the
most
devastating
of
all
the
causes
of
destruction
that
find
their
origin
in
the
operations
of

lumberman
the

of

only
these

but
the

destroys
indiscriminately
every
age
and
every
species
of
tree
while
then
without
much
injury

the
younger

the

will
bear
several

no

boast
the

almost
rivalled

and
the

so
slow

williams

sixty
years

with

remark
that
his
measurements
do
not
denote
the
greatest
which

are

he
adds
a
note
saying
that
a
white
pine
was
cut
in
dunstable
new
hampshire
in
the
year
the
diameter
of
which
was
seven
feet
and
eight
inches
dwight
says
that
a
fallen
pine
in
connecticut
was
found
to
measure
two
hundred
and
feet
in
height
and
adds
a
few
years
since
such
trees
were
in
great
numbers
along
the
northern
parts
of
connecticut
river
in
another
letter
he
speaks
of
the
white
pine
as
frequently
six
feet
in
diameter
and
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
height
and
states
that
a
pine
had
been
cut
in
lancaster
new
hampshire
which
measured
two
hundred
and
feet
emerson
wrote
in
fifty
years
ago
several
trees
growing
on
rather
dry
land
in
blandford
massachusetts
measured
after
they
were
felled
two
hundred
and
feet
all
these
trees
are
surpassed
by
a
pine
felled
at
hanover
new
hampshire
about
a
hundred
years
ago
and
described
as
measuring
two
hundred
and
feet
these
descriptions
it
will
be
noticed
apply
to
trees
cut
from
sixty
to
one
hundred
years
since
persons
whom
observation
has
rendered
familiar
with
the
present
character
of
the
american
forest
will
be
struck
with
the
smallness
of
the
diameter
which
williams
and
dwight
ascribe
to
trees
of
such
extraordinary
height
individuals
of
the
several
species
mentioned
in
williams
table
are
now
hardly
to
be
found
in
the
same
climate
exceeding
one
half
or
at
most
two
thirds
of
the
height
which
he
assigns
to
them
but
except
in
the
case
of
the
oak
and
the
pine
the
diameter
stated
by
him
would
not
be
thought
very
extraordinary
in
trees
of
far
less
height
now
standing
even
in
the
species
i
have
excepted
those
diameters
with
half
the
heights
of
williams
might
perhaps
be
paralleled
at
the
present
time
and
many
elms
transplanted
at
a
diameter
of
six
inches
within
the
memory
of
persons
still
living
measure
six
and
sometimes
even
seven
feet
through
for
this
change
in
the
growth
of
forest
trees
there
are
two
reasons
the
one
is
that
the
great
commercial
value
of
the
pine
and
the
oak
have
caused
the
destruction
of
all
the
best
that
is
the
tallest
and
straightest
specimens
of
both
the
other
that
the
thinning
of
the
woods
by
the
axe
of
the
lumberman
has
allowed
the
access
of
light
and
heat
and
air
to
trees
of
humbler
worth
and
lower
stature
which
have
survived
their
more
towering
brethren
these
consequently
have
been
able
to
expand
their
crowns
and
swell
their
stems
to
a
degree
not
possible
so
long
as
they
were
overshadowed
and
stifled
by
the
lordly
oak
and
pine
while
therefore
the
new
england
forester
must
search
long
before
he
finds
a
pine
fit
to
be
the
mast
of
some
great
ammiral
beeches
and
elms
and
birches
as
sturdy
as
the
mightiest
of
their
progenitors
are
still
no
rarity
another
evil
sometimes
of
serious
magnitude
which
attends
the
operations
of
the
lumberman
is
the
injury
to
the
banks
of
rivers
from
the
practice
of
floating
i
do
not
here
allude
to
rafts
which
being
under
the
control
of
those
who
navigate
them
may
be
so
guided
as
to
avoid
damage
to
the
shore
but
to
masts
logs
and
other
pieces
of
timber
singly
intrusted
to
the
streams
to
be
conveyed
by
their
currents
to
sawmill
ponds
or
to
convenient
places
for
collecting
them
into
rafts
the
lumbermen
usually
haul
the
timber
to
the
banks
of
the
rivers
in
the
winter
and
when
the
spring
floods
swell
the
streams
and
break
up
the
ice
they
roll
the
logs
into
the
water
leaving
them
to
float
down
to
their
destination
if
the
transporting
stream
is
too
small
to
furnish
a
sufficient
channel
for
this
rude
navigation
it
is
sometimes
dammed
up
and
the
timber
collected
in
the
pond
thus
formed
above
the
dam
when
the
pond
is
full
a
sluice
is
opened
or
the
dam
is
blown
up
or
otherwise
suddenly
broken
and
the
whole
mass
of
lumber
above
it
is
hurried
down
with
the
rolling
flood
both
of
these
modes
of
proceeding
expose
the
banks
of
the
rivers
employed
as
channels
of
flotation
to
abrasion
and
in
some
of
the
american
states
it
has
been
found
necessary
to
protect
by
special
legislation
the
lands
through
which
they
flow
from
the
serious
injury
sometimes
received
through
the
practices
i
have
described
causes
of
the
destruction
of
european
the
causes
of
forest
waste
thus
far
enumerated
are
more
or
less
common
to
both
continents
but
in
europe
extensive
woods
have
at
different
periods
been
deliberately
destroyed
by
fire
or
the
axe
because
they
afforded
a
retreat
to
enemies
robbers
and
outlaws
and
this
practice
is
said
to
have
been
resorted
to
in
the
mediterranean
provinces
of
france
as
recently
as
the
time
of
napoleon
i
the
severe
and
even
sanguinary
legislation
by
which
some
of
the
governments
of
mediæval
europe
as
well
as
of
earlier
ages
protected
the
woods
was
dictated
by
a
love
of
the
chase
or
the
fear
of
a
scarcity
of
fuel
and
timber
the
laws
of
almost
every
european
state
more
or
less
adequately
secure
the
permanence
of
the
forest
and
i
believe
spain
is
the
only
european
land
which
has
not
made
some
public
provision
for
the
protection
and
restoration
of
the
woods
the
only
country
whose
people
systematically
war
upon
the
garden
of
god
forests
and
game
the
french
authors
i
have
quoted
as
well
as
many
other
writers
of
the
same
nation
refer
to
the
french
revolution
as
having
given
a
new
impulse
to
destructive
causes
which
were
already
threatening
the
total
extermination
of
the
woods
the
general
crusade
against
the
forests
which
accompanied
that
important
event
is
to
be
ascribed
in
a
considerable
degree
to
political
resentments
the
forest
codes
of
the
mediæval
kings
and
the
local
coutumes
of
feudalism
contained
many
severe
and
even
inhuman
provisions
adopted
rather
for
the
preservation
of
game
than
from
any
enlightened
views
of
the
more
important
functions
of
the
woods
ordericus
vitalis
informs
us
that
william
the
conqueror
destroyed
sixty
parishes
and
drove
out
their
inhabitants
in
order
that
he
might
turn
their
lands
into
a
forest
to
be
reserved
as
a
hunting
ground
for
himself
and
his
posterity
and
he
punished
with
death
the
killing
of
a
deer
wild
boar
or
even
a
hare
his
successor
william
rufus
according
to
the
des
ducs
de
normandie
et
des
rois
was
hunting
one
day
in
a
new
forest
which
he
had
caused
to
be
made
out
of
eighteen
parishes
that
he
had
destroyed
when
by
mischance
he
was
killed
by
an
arrow
wherewith
tyreus
de
rois
sir
walter
tyrell
thought
to
slay
a
beast
but
missed
the
beast
and
slew
the
king
who
was
beyond
it
and
in
this
very
same
forest
his
brother
richard
ran
so
hard
against
a
tree
that
he
died
of
it
and
men
commonly
said
that
these
things
were
because
they
had
so
laid
waste
and
taken
the
said
parishes
these
barbarous
acts
as
bonnemère
observes
were
simply
the
transfer
of
the
customs
of
the
french
kings
of
their
vassals
and
even
of
inferior
gentlemen
to
conquered
england
the
death
of
a
hare
says
our
author
was
a
hanging
matter
the
murder
of
a
plover
a
capital
crime
death
was
inflicted
on
those
who
spread
nets
for
pigeons
wretches
who
had
drawn
a
bow
upon
a
stag
were
to
be
tied
to
the
animal
alive
and
among
the
seigniors
it
was
a
standing
excuse
for
having
killed
game
on
forbidden
ground
that
they
aimed
at
a
serf
the
feudal
lords
enforced
these
codes
with
unrelenting
rigor
and
not
unfrequently
took
the
law
into
their
own
hands
in
the
time
of
louis
ix
according
to
william
of
nangis
three
noble
children
born
in
flanders
who
were
sojourning
at
the
abbey
of
nicholas
in
the
wood
to
learn
the
speech
of
france
went
out
into
the
forest
of
the
abbey
with
their
bows
and
arrows
to
disport
them
in
shooting
hares
chased
the
game
which
they
had
started
in
the
wood
of
the
abbey
into
the
forest
of
enguerrand
lord
of
coucy
and
were
taken
by
the
sergeants
which
kept
the
wood
when
the
fell
and
pitiless
sir
enguerrand
knew
this
he
had
the
children
straightway
hanged
without
any
manner
of
trial
the
matter
being
brought
to
the
notice
of
good
king
louis
sir
enguerrand
was
summoned
to
appear
and
finally
after
many
feudal
shifts
and
dilatory
pleas
brought
to
trial
before
louis
himself
and
a
special
council
notwithstanding
the
opposition
of
the
other
seigniors
who
it
is
needless
to
say
spared
no
efforts
to
save
a
peer
probably
not
a
greater
criminal
than
themselves
the
king
was
much
inclined
to
inflict
the
punishment
of
death
on
the
proud
baron
if
he
believed
said
he
that
our
lord
would
be
as
well
content
with
hanging
as
with
pardoning
he
would
hang
sir
enguerrand
in
spite
of
all
his
barons
but
noble
and
clerical
interests
unfortunately
prevailed
the
king
was
persuaded
to
inflict
a
milder
retribution
and
the
murderer
was
condemned
to
pay
ten
thousand
livres
in
coin
and
to
build
for
the
souls
of
the
three
children
two
chapels
wherein
mass
should
be
said
every
day
the
hope
of
shortening
the
purgatorial
term
of
the
young
persons
by
the
religious
rites
to
be
celebrated
in
the
chapels
was
doubtless
the
consideration
which
operated
most
powerfully
on
the
mind
of
the
king
and
europe
lost
a
great
example
for
the
sake
of
a
mass
the
desolation
and
depopulation
resulting
from
the
extension
of
the
forest
and
the
enforcement
of
the
game
laws
induced
several
of
the
french
kings
to
consent
to
some
relaxation
of
the
severity
of
these
latter
francis
i
however
revived
their
barbarous
provisions
and
according
to
bonnemère
even
so
good
a
monarch
as
henry
iv
reënacted
them
and
signed
the
sentence
of
death
upon
peasants
guilty
of
having
defended
their
fields
against
devastation
by
wild
beasts
a
fine
of
twenty
livres
he
continues
was
imposed
on
every
one
shooting
at
pigeons
which
at
that
time
swooped
down
by
thousands
upon
the
fields
and
devoured
the
seed
but
let
us
count
even
this
a
progress
for
we
have
seen
that
the
murder
of
a
pigeon
had
been
a
capital
crime
not
only
were
the
slightest
trespasses
on
the
forest
domain
the
cutting
of
an
oxgoad
for
instance
severely
punished
but
game
animals
were
still
sacred
when
they
had
wandered
from
their
native
precincts
and
were
ravaging
the
fields
of
the
peasantry
a
herd
of
deer
or
of
wild
boars
often
consumed
or
trod
down
a
harvest
of
grain
the
sole
hope
of
the
year
for
a
whole
family
and
the
simple
driving
out
of
such
animals
from
this
costly
pasturage
brought
dire
vengeance
on
the
head
of
the
rustic
who
had
endeavored
to
save
his
children
bread
from
their
voracity
at
all
times
says
paul
louis
courier
speaking
in
the
name
of
the
peasants
of
chambord
in
the
simple
discours
the
game
has
made
war
upon
us
paris
was
blockaded
eight
hundred
years
by
the
deer
and
its
environs
now
so
rich
so
fertile
did
not
yield
bread
enough
to
support
the
gamekeepers
in
the
popular
mind
the
forest
was
associated
with
all
the
abuses
of
feudalism
and
the
evils
the
peasantry
had
suffered
from
the
legislation
which
protected
both
it
and
the
game
it
sheltered
blinded
them
to
the
still
greater
physical
mischiefs
which
its
destruction
was
to
entail
upon
them
no
longer
protected
by

the
crown
forests
and
those
of
the
great
lords
were
attacked
with
relentless
fury
unscrupulously
plundered
and
wantonly
laid
waste
and
even
the
rights
of
property
in
small
private
woods
were
no
longer
respected
various
absurd
theories
some
of
which
are
not
even
yet
exploded
were
propagated
with
regard
to
the
economical
advantages
of
converting
the
forest
into
pasture
and
ploughland
its
injurious
effects
upon
climate
health
facility
of
internal
communication
and
the
like
thus
resentful
memory
of
the
wrongs
associated
with
the
forest
popular
ignorance
and
the
cupidity
of
speculators
cunning
enough
to
turn
these
circumstances
to
profitable
account
combined
to
hasten
the
sacrifice
of
the
remaining
woods
and
a
waste
was
produced
which
hundreds
of
years
and
millions
of
treasure
will
hardly
repair
forest
plants
and
vitality
of
another
function
of
the
woods
to
which
i
have
barely
alluded
deserves
a
fuller
notice
than
can
be
bestowed
upon
it
in
a
treatise
the
scope
of
which
is
purely
economical
the
forest
is
the
native
habitat
of
a
large
number
of
humbler
plants
to
the
growth
and
perpetuation
of
which
its
shade
its
humidity
and
its
vegetable
mould
appear
to
be
indispensable
necessities
we
can
not
positively
say
that
the
felling
of
the
woods
in
a
given
vegetable
province
would
involve
the
final
extinction
of
the
smaller
plants
which
are
found
only
within
their
precincts
some
of
these
though
not
naturally
propagating
themselves
in
the
open
ground
may
perhaps
germinate
and
grow
under
artificial
stimulation
and
protection
and
finally
become
hardy
enough
to
maintain
an
independent
existence
in
very
different
circumstances
from
those
which
at
present
seem
essential
to
their
life
besides
this
although
the
accounts
of
the
growth
of
seeds
which
have
lain
for
ages
in
the
ashy
dryness
of
egyptian
catacombs
are
to
be
received
with
great
caution
or
more
probably
to
be
rejected
altogether
yet
their
vitality
seems
almost
imperishable
while
they
remain
in
the
situations
in
which
nature
deposits
them
when
a
forest
old
enough
to
have
witnessed
the
mysteries
of
the
druids
is
felled
trees
of
other
species
spring
up
in
its
place
and
when
they
in
their
turn
fall
before
the
axe
sometimes
even
as
soon
as
they
have
spread
their
protecting
shade
over
the
surface
the
germs
which
their
predecessors
had
shed
years
perhaps
centuries
before
sprout
up
and
in
due
time
if
not
choked
by
other
trees
belonging
to
a
later
stage
in
the
order
of
natural
succession
restore
again
the
original
wood
in
these
cases
the
seeds
of
the
new
crop
may
often
have
been
brought
by
the
wind
by
birds
by
quadrupeds
or
by
other
causes
but
in
many
instances
this
explanation
is
not
probable
when
newly
cleared
ground
is
burnt
over
in
the
united
states
the
ashes
are
hardly
cold
before
they
are
covered
with
a
crop
of
fire
weed
a
tall
herbaceous
plant
very
seldom
seen
growing
under
other
circumstances
and
often
not
to
be
found
for
a
distance
of
many
miles
from
the
clearing
its
seeds
whether
the
fruit
of
an
ancient
vegetation
or
newly
sown
by
winds
or
birds
require
either
a
quickening
by
a
heat
which
raises
to
a
certain
high
point
the
temperature
of
the
stratum
where
they
lie
buried
or
a
special
pabulum
furnished
only
by
the
combustion
of
the
vegetable
remains
that
cover
the
ground
in
the
woods
earth
brought
up
from
wells
or
other
excavations
soon
produces
a
harvest
of
plants
often
very
unlike
those
of
the
local
flora
moritz
wagner
as
quoted
by
wittwer
remarks
in
his
description
of
mount
ararat
a
singular
phenomenon
to
which
my
guide
drew
my
attention
is
the
appearance
of
several
plants
on
the
left
by
the
last
catastrophe
an
earthquake
which
grow
nowhere
else
on
the
mountain
and
had
never
been
observed
in
this
region
before
the
seeds
of
these
plants
were
probably
brought
by
birds
and
found
in
the
loose
clayey
soil
remaining
from
the
streams
of
mud
the
conditions
of
growth
which
the
other
soil
of
the
mountain
refused
them
this
is
probable
enough
but
it
is
hardly
less
so
that
the
flowing
mud
brought
them
up
to
the
influence
of
air
and
sun
from
depths
where
a
previous
convulsion
had
buried
them
ages
before
seeds
of
small
sylvan
plants
too
deeply
buried
by
successive
layers
of
forest
foliage
and
the
mould
resulting
from
its
decomposition
to
be
reached
by
the
plough
when
the
trees
are
gone
and
the
ground
brought
under
cultivation
may
if
a
wiser
posterity
replants
the
wood
which
sheltered
their
parent
stems
germinate
and
grow
after
lying
for
generations
in
a
state
of
suspended
animation
darwin
says
in
staffordshire
on
the
estate
of
a
relation
where
i
had
ample
means
of
investigation
there
was
a
large
and
extremely
barren
heath
which
had
never
been
touched
by
the
hand
of
man
but
several
hundred
acres
of
exactly
the
same
nature
had
been
enclosed
years
previously
and
planted
with
scotch
fir
the
change
in
the
native
vegetation
of
the
planted
part
of
the
heath
was
most
remarkable
more
than
is
generally
seen
in
passing
from
one
quite
different
soil
to
another
not
only
the
proportional
numbers
of
the
heath
plants
were
wholly
changed
but
of
plants
not
counting
grasses
and
sedges
flourished
in
the
plantation
which
could
not
be
found
on
the
heath
had
the
author
informed
us
that
these
twelve
plants
belonged
to
a
species
whose
seeds
enter
into
the
nutriment
of
the
birds
which
appeared
with
the
young
wood
we
could
easily
account
for
their
presence
in
the
soil
but
he
says
distinctly
that
the
birds
were
of
insectivorous
species
and
it
therefore
seems
more
probable
that
the
seeds
had
been
deposited
when
an
ancient
forest
protected
the
growth
of
the
plants
which
bore
them
and
that
they
sprang
up
to
new
life
when
a
return
of
favorable
conditions
awaked
them
from
a
sleep
of
centuries
darwin
indeed
says
that
the
heath
had
never
been
touched
by
the
hand
of
man
perhaps
not
after
it
became
a
heath
but
what
evidence
is
there
to
control
the
general
presumption
that
this
heath
was
preceded
by
a
forest
in
whose
shade
the
vegetables
which
dropped
the
seeds
in
question
might
have
grown
although
therefore
the
destruction
of
a
wood
and
the
reclaiming
of
the
soil
to
agricultural
uses
suppose
the
death
of
its
smaller
dependent
flora
these
revolutions
do
not
exclude
the
possibility
of
its
resurrection
in
a
practical
view
of
the
subject
however
we
must
admit
that
when
the
woodman
fells
a
tree
he
sacrifices
the
colony
of
humbler
growths
which
had
vegetated
under
its
protection
some
wood
plants
are
known
to
possess
valuable
medicinal
properties
and
experiment
may
show
that
the
number
of
these
is
greater
than
we
now
suppose
few
of
them
however
have
any
other
economical
value
than
that
of
furnishing
a
slender
pasturage
to
cattle
allowed
to
roam
in
the
woods
and
even
this
small
advantage
is
far
more
than
compensated
by
the
mischief
done
to
the
young
trees
by
browsing
animals
upon
the
whole
the
importance
of
this
class
of
vegetables
as
physic
or
as
food
is
not
such
as
to
furnish
a
very
telling
popular
argument
for
the
conservation
of
the
forest
as
a
necessary
means
of
their
perpetuation
more
potent
remedial
agents
may
supply
their
place
in
the
and
an
acre
of
grass
land
yields
more
nutriment
for
cattle
than
a
range
of
a
hundred
acres
of
forest
but
he
whose
sympathies
with
nature
have
taught
him
to
feel
that
there
is
a
fellowship
between
all
god
creatures
to
love
the
brilliant
ore
better
than
the

that
sheltered

although
as
i
have
said
birds
do
not
frequent
the
deeper
recesses
of
the

yet
a
very
large
proportion
of
them
build
their
nests
in
trees
and
find
in
their
foliage
and
branches
a
secure
retreat
from
the
inclemencies
of
the

and
the
pursuit
of
the
reptiles
and
quadrupeds

prey
upon

song
and
when
the
gray
morning
calls
the
creeping
things
of
the
earth
out
of
their
night
cells
it
summons
from
the
neighboring
wood
legions
of
their
winged
enemies
which
swoop
down
upon
the
fields
to
save
man
harvests
by
devouring
the
destroying
worm
and
surprising
the
lagging
beetle
in
his
tardy
retreat
to
the
dark

he
lurks
through

hours
of

the
insects
most
injurious
to
rural
industry
do
not
multiply
in
or
near
the

the
locust
which
ravages
the
east
with
its
voracious
armies
is
bred
in
vast
open
plains
which
admit
the
full
heat
of
the

hasten

hatching
of

gather
no
moisture
to
destroy
them
and
harbor
no

to

upon

it
is
only
since
the
felling
of
the
forests
of
asia
minor
and
cyrene
that
the
locust
has
become
so
fearfully
destructive
in
those
countries
and
the
grasshopper
which
now
threatens
to
be
almost
as
great
a
pest
to
the
agriculture
of
some
north
american
soils
breeds
in
seriously
injurious
numbers
only
where
a
wide
extent
of
surface
is
bare
of
woods
of
the
in
most
parts
of
europe
the
woods
are
already
so
nearly
extirpated
that
the
mere
protection
of
those
which
now
exist
is
by
no
means
an
adequate
remedy
for
the
evils
resulting
from
the
want
of
them
and
besides
as
i
have
already
said
abundant
experience
has
shown
that
no
legislation
can
secure
the
permanence
of
the
forest
in
private
hands
enlightened
individuals
in
most
european
states
governments
in
others
have
made
very
extensive
plantations
and
france
has
now
set
herself
energetically
at
work
to
restore
the
woods
in
the
southern
provinces
and
thereby
to
prevent
the
utter
depopulation
and
waste
with
which
that
once
fertile
soil
and
delicious
climate
are
threatened
the
objects
of
the
restoration
of
the
forest
are
as
multifarious
as
the
motives
that
have
led
to
its
destruction
and
as
the
evils
which
that
destruction
has
occasioned
it
is
hoped
that
the
planting
of
the
mountains
will
diminish
the
frequency
and
violence
of
river
inundations
prevent
the
formation
of
torrents
mitigate
the
extremes
of
atmospheric
temperature
humidity
and
precipitation
restore
springs
rivulets
and
sources
of
irrigation
shelter
the
fields
from
chilling
and
from
parching
winds
prevent
the
spread
of
miasmatic
effluvia
and
finally
furnish
an
inexhaustible
and
supply
of
a
material
indispensable
to
so
many
purposes
of
domestic
comfort
to
the
successful
exercise
of
every
art
of
peace
every
destructive
energy
of
war
but
our
enumeration
of
the
uses
of
trees
is
not
yet
complete
besides
the
influence
of
the
forest
in
mountain
ranges
as
a
means
of
preventing
the
scooping
out
of
ravines
and
the
accumulations
of
water
which
fill
them
trees
subserve
a
valuable
purpose
in
lower
positions
as
barriers
against
the
spread
of
floods
and
of
the
material
they
transport
with
them
but
this
will
be
more
appropriately
considered
in
the
chapter
on
the
waters
and
another
very
important
use
of
trees
that
of
fixing
movable
and
reclaiming
them
to
profitable
cultivation
will
be
pointed
out
in
the
chapter
on
the
sands
the
vast
extension
of
railroads
of
manufactures
and
the
mechanical
arts
of
military
armaments
and
especially
of
the
commercial
fleets
and
navies
of
christendom
within
the
present
century
has
greatly
augmented
the
demand
for
wood
and
but
for
improvements
in
metallurgy
which
have
facilitated
the
substitution
of
iron
for
that
material
the
last
years
would
almost
have
stripped
europe
of
her
only
remaining
trees
fit
for
such
uses
the
walnut
trees
alone
felled
in
europe
within
two
years
to
furnish
the
armies
of
america
with
gunstocks
would
form
a
forest
of
no
inconsiderable
extent
forests
of
mirabeau
estimated
the
forests
of
france
in
at
seventeen
millions
of
hectares
acres
in
they
were
reduced
to
eight
millions
acres
this
would
be
at
the
rate
of
hectares
acres
per
year
troy
from
whose
valuable
pamphlet
sur
le
reboisement
des
i
take
these
statistical
details
supposes
that
mirabeau
statement
may
have
been
an
extravagant
one
but
it
still
remains
certain
that
the
waste
has
been
enormous
for
it
is
known
that
in
some
departments
that
of
ariège
for
instance
clearing
has
gone
on
during
the
last
half
century
at
the
rate
of
three
thousand
acres
a
year
and
in
all
parts
of
the
empire
trees
have
been
felled
faster
than
they
have
grown
the
total
area
of
france
excluding
savoy
is
about
one
hundred
and
millions
of
acres
the
extent
of
forest
supposed
by
mirabeau
would
be
about
per
cent
of
the
whole
territory
in
a
country
and
a
climate
where
the
conservative
influences
of
the
forest
are
so
necessary
as
in
france
trees
must
cover
a
large
surface
and
be
grouped
in
large
masses
in
order
to
discharge
to
the
best
advantage
the
various
functions
assigned
to
them
by
nature
the
consumption
of
wood
is
rapidly
increasing
in
that
empire
and
a
large
part
of
its
territory
is
mountainous
sterile
and
otherwise
such
in
character
or
situation
that
it
can
be
more
profitably
devoted
to
the
growth
of
wood
than
to
any
agricultural
use
hence
it
is
evident
that
the
proportion
of
forest
in
taking
even
large
estimate
was
not
very
much
too
great
for
permanent
maintenance
though
doubtless
the
distribution
was
so
unequal
that
it
would
have
been
sound
policy
to
fell
the
woods
and
clear
land
in
some
provinces
while
large
forests
should
have
been
planted
in
others
during
the
period
in
question
france
neither
exported
manufactured
wood
or
rough
timber
nor
derived
important
collateral
advantages
of
any
sort
from
the
destruction
of
her
forests
she
is
consequently
impoverished
and
crippled
to
the
extent
of
the
difference
between
what
she
actually
possesses
of
wooded
surface
and
what
she
ought
to
have
retained
italy
and
spain
are
bared
of
trees
in
a
greater
degree
than
france
and
even
russia
which
we
habitually
consider
as
substantially
a
forest
country
is
beginning
to
suffer
seriously
for
want
of
wood
jourdier
as
quoted
by
clavé
observes
instead
of
a
vast
territory
with
immense
forests
which
we
expect
to
meet
one
sees
only
scattered
groves
thinned
by
the
wind
or
by
the
axe
of
the
grounds
cut
over
and
more
or
less
recently
cleared
for
cultivation
there
is
probably
not
a
single
district
in
russia
which
has
not
to
deplore
the
ravages
of
man
or
of
fire
those
two
great
enemies
of
muscovite
sylviculture
this
is
so
true
that
men
already
foresee
a
crisis
which
will
become
terrible
unless
the
discovery
of
great
deposits
of
some
new
combustible
as
pit
coal
or
anthracite
shall
diminish
its
evils
germany
from
character
of
surface
and
climate
and
from
the
attention
which
has
long
been
paid
in
all
the
german
states
to
sylviculture
is
taken
as
a
whole
in
a
far
better
condition
in
this
respect
than
its
more
southern
neighbors
but
in
the
alpine
provinces
of
bavaria
and
austria
the
same
improvidence
which
marks
the
rural
economy
of
the
corresponding
districts
of
switzerland
italy
and
france
is
producing
effects
hardly
less
disastrous
as
an
instance
of
the
scarcity
of
fuel
in
some
parts
of
the
territory
of
bavaria
where
not
long
since
wood
abounded
i
may
mention
the
fact
that
the
water
of
salt
springs
is
in
some
instances
conveyed
to
the
distance
of
sixty
miles
in
iron
pipes
to
reach
a
supply
of
fuel
for
boiling
it
down
of
the
united
states
and
the
vast
forests
of
the
united
states
and
canada
can
not
long
resist
the
improvident
habits
of
the
backwoodsman
and
the
increased
demand
for
lumber
according
to
the
census
of
the
former
country
for
which
gives
returns
of
the
sawed
and
planed
lumber
alone
timber
for
framing
and
for
a
vast
variety
of
mechanical
purposes
being
omitted
altogether
the
value
of
the
former
material
prepared
for
market
in
the
united
states
was
in
in
the
quantity
of
unsawed
lumber
is
not
likely
to
have
increased
in
the
same
proportion
because
comparatively
little
is
exported
in
that
condition
and
because
masonry
is
fast
taking
the
place
of
carpentry
in
building
and
stone
brick
and
iron
are
used
instead
of
timber
more
largely
than
they
were
ten
years
ago
still
a
much
greater
quantity
of
unsawed
lumber
must
have
been
marketed
in
than
in
it
must
further
be
admitted
that
the
price
of
lumber
rose
considerably
between
those
dates
and
consequently
that
the
increase
in
quantity
is
not
to
be
measured
by
the
increase
in
pecuniary
value
perhaps
this
rise
of
prices
may
even
be
sufficient
to
make
the
entire
difference
between
the
value
of
sawed
and
planed
lumber
produced
in
the
ten
years
in
question
by
the
six
new
england
states
per
cent
and
the
six
middle
states
per
cent
but
the
amount
produced
by
the
western
and
by
the
southern
states
had
doubled
and
that
returned
from
the
pacific
states
and
territories
had
trebled
in
value
in
the
same
interval
so
that
there
was
certainly
in
those
states
a
large
increase
in
the
actual
quantity
prepared
for
sale
i
greatly
doubt
whether
any
one
of
the
american
states
except
perhaps
oregon
has
at
this
moment
more
woodland
than
it
ought
permanently
to
preserve
though
no
doubt
a
different
distribution
of
the
forests
in
all
of
them
might
be
highly
advantageous
it
is
a
great
misfortune
to
the
american
union
that
the
state
governments
have
so
generally
disposed
of
their
original
domain
to
private
citizens
it
is
true
that
public
property
is
not
sufficiently
respected
in
the
united
states
and
it
is
also
true
that
within
the
memory
of
almost
every
man
of
mature
age
timber
was
of
so
little
value
in
that
country
that
the
owners
of
private
woodlands
submitted
almost
without
complaint
to
what
would
be
regarded
elsewhere
as
very
aggravated
trespasses
upon
them
under
such
circumstances
it
is
difficult
to
protect
the
forest
whether
it
belong
to
the
state
or
to
individuals
property
of
this
kind
would
be
subject
to
much
plunder
as
well
as
to
frequent
damage
by
fire
the
destruction
from
these
causes
would
indeed
considerably
lessen
but
would
not
wholly
annihilate
the
climatic
and
geographical
influences
of
the
forest
or
ruinously
diminish
its
value
as
a
regular
source
of
supply
of
fuel
and
timber
for
prevention
of
the
evils
upon
which
i
have
so
long
dwelt
the
american
people
must
look
to
the
diffusion
of
general
intelligence
on
this
subject
and
to
the
enlightened
self
interest
for
which
they
are
remarkable
not
to
the
action
of
their
local
or
general
legislatures
even
in
france
government
has
moved
with
too
slow
and
hesitating
a
pace
and
preventive
measures
do
not
yet
compensate
destructive
causes
the
judicious
remarks
of
troy
on
this
point
may
well
be
applied
to
other
countries
than
france
other
measures
of
public
policy
than
the
preservation
of
the
woods
to
move
softly
says
he
is
to
commit
the
most
dangerous
the
most
unpardonable
of
imprudences
it
diminishes
the
prestige
of
authority
it
furnishes
a
triumph
to
the
sneerer
and
the
incredulous
it
strengthens
opposition
and
encourages
resistance
it
ruins
the
administration
in
the
opinion
of
the
people
weakens
its
power
and
depresses
its
courage
economy
of
the
the
legislation
of
european
states
upon
sylviculture
and
the
practice
of
that
art
divide
themselves
into
two
great
branches
the
preservation
of
existing
forests
and
the
creation
of
new
from
the
long
operation
of
causes
already
set
forth
what
is
understood
in
america
and
other
new
countries
by
the
primitive
forest
no
longer
exists
in
the
territories
which
were
the
seats
of
ancient
civilization
and
empire
except
upon
a
small
scale
and
in
remote
and
almost
inaccessible
glens
quite
out
of
the
reach
of
ordinary
observation
the
oldest
european
woods
indeed
are
native
that
is
sprung
from
seed
or
from
the
roots
of
trees
which
have
been
felled
for
human
purposes
but
their
growth
has
been
controlled
in
a
variety
of
ways
by
man
and
by
domestic
animals
and
they
always
present
more
or
less
of
an
artificial
character
and
arrangement
both
they
and
planted
forests
which
though
certainly
not
few
are
of
recent
date
in
europe
demand
as
well
for
protection
as
for
promotion
of
growth
a
treatment
different
in
some
respects
from
that
which
would
be
suited
to
the
character
and
wants
of
the
virgin
wood
on
this
latter
branch
of
the
subject
experience
and
observation
have
not
yet
collected
a
sufficient
stock
of
facts
to
serve
for
the
construction
of
a
complete
system
of
sylviculture
but
the
management
of
the
forest
as
it
exists
in
france
the
different
zones
and
climates
of
which
country
present
many
points
of
analogy
with
those
of
the
united
states
and
some
of
the
british
colonies
has
been
carefully
studied
and
several
manuals
of
practice
have
been
prepared
for
the
foresters
of
that
empire
i
believe
the
best
of
these
is
the
élémentaire
de
culture
des
bois
créé
à
forestière
de
nancy
par
lorentz
complété
et
publié
par
with
a
supplement
under
the
title
of
des
forêts
par
henri
the
sur
forestière
par
jules
which
i
have
often
quoted
presents
a
great
number
of
interesting
views
on
this
subject
and
well
deserves
to
be
translated
for
the
use
of
the
english
and
american
reader
but
it
is
not
designed
as
a
practical
guide
and
it
does
not
profess
to
be
sufficiently
specific
in
its
details
to
serve
that
purpose
notwithstanding
the
difference
of
conditions
between
the
aboriginal
and
the
trained
forest
the
judicious
observer
who
aims
at
the
preservation
of
the
former
will
reap
much
instruction
from
the
treatises
i
have
cited
and
i
believe
he
will
be
convinced
that
the
sooner
a
natural
wood
is
brought
into
the
state
of
an
artificially
regulated
one
the
better
it
is
for
all
the
multiplied
interests
which
depend
on
the
wise
administration
of
this
branch
of
public
economy
one
consideration
bearing
on
this
subject
has
received
less
attention
than
it
merits
because
most
persons
interested
in
such
questions
have
not
opportunities
for
the
comparison
i
refer
to
i
mean
the
great
general
superiority
of
cultivated
timber
to
that
of
strictly
spontaneous
growth
i
say
superiority
because
there
are
exceptions
to
the
rule
the
white
pine
for
instance
and
other
trees
of
similar
character
and
uses
require
for
their
perfect
growth
a
density
of
forest
vegetation
around
them
which
protects
them
from
too
much
agitation
by
wind
and
from
the
persistence
of
the
lateral
branches
which
fill
the
wood
with
knots
a
pine
which
has
grown
under
those
conditions
possesses
a
tall
straight
stem
admirably
fitted
for
masts
and
spars
and
at
the
same
time
its
wood
is
almost
wholly
free
from
knots
is
regular
in
annular
structure
soft
and
uniform
in
texture
and
consequently
superior
to
almost
all
other
timber
for
joinery
if
while
a
large
pine
is
spared
the
or
other
smaller
trees
around
it
are
felled
the
swaying
of
the
tree
from
the
action
of
the
wind
mechanically
produces
separations
between
the
layers
of
annual
growth
and
greatly
diminishes
the
value
of
the
timber
the
same
defect
is
often
observed
in
pines
which
from
some
accident
of
growth
have
much
overtopped
their
fellows
in
the
virgin
forest
the
white
pine
growing
in
the
fields
or
in
open
glades
in
the
woods
is
totally
different
from
the
true
forest
tree
both
in
general
aspect
and
in
quality
of
wood
its
stem
is
much
shorter
its
top
less
tapering
its
foliage
denser
and
more
inclined
to
gather
into
tufts
its
branches
more
numerous
and
of
larger
diameter
its
wood
shows
much
more
distinctly
the
divisions
of
annual
growth
is
of
coarser
grain
harder
and
more
difficult
to
work
into
mitre
joints
intermixed
with
the
most
valuable
pines
in
the
american
forests
are
met
many
trees
of
the
character
i
have
just
described
the
lumbermen
call
them
saplings
and
generally
regard
them
as
different
in
species
from
the
true
white
pine
but
botanists
are
unable
to
establish
a
distinction
between
them
and
as
they
agree
in
almost
all
respects
with
trees
grown
in
the
open
grounds
from
known
seedlings
i
believe
their
peculiar
character
is
due
to
unfavorable
circumstances
in
their
early
growth
the
pine
then
is
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
as
to
the
inferiority
of
the
forest
to
the
tree
the
pasture
oak
and
pasture
beech
on
the
contrary
are
well
known
to
produce
far
better
timber
than
those
grown
in
the
woods
and
there
are
few
trees
to
which
the
remark
is
not
equally
applicable
another
advantage
of
the
artificially
regulated
forest
is
that
it
admits
of
such
grading
of
the
ground
as
to
favor
the
retention
or
discharge
of
water
at
will
while
the
facilities
it
affords
for
selecting
and
duly
proportioning
as
well
as
properly
spacing
the
trees
which
compose
it
are
too
obvious
to
require
to
be
more
than
hinted
at
in
conducting
these
operations
we
must
have
a
diligent
eye
to
the
requirements
of
nature
and
must
remember
that
a
wood
is
not
an
arbitrary
assemblage
of
trees
to
be
selected
and
disposed
according
to
the
caprice
of
its
owner
a
forest
says
clavé
is
not
as
is
often
supposed
a
simple
collection
of
trees
succeeding
each
other
in
long
perspective
without
bond
of
union
and
capable
of
isolation
from
each
other
it
is
on
the
contrary
a
whole
the
different
parts
of
which
are
interdependent
upon
each
other
and
it
constitutes
so
to
speak
a
true
individuality
every
forest
has
a
special
character
determined
by
the
form
of
the
surface
it
grows
upon
the
kinds
of
trees
that
compose
it
and
the
manner
in
which
they
are
grouped
and
american
trees
the
woods
of
north
america
are
strikingly
distinguished
from
those
of
europe
by
the
vastly
greater
variety
of
species
they
contain
according
to
clavé
there
are
in
france
and
in
most
parts
of
europe
only
about
twenty
forest
trees
five
or
six
of
which
are
and
resinous
the
remainder
our
author
however
doubtless
means
genera
though
he
uses
the
word
rossmässler
enumerates
species
of
forest
trees
as
found
in
germany
but
some
of
these
are
mere
shrubs
some
are
fruit
and
properly
garden
trees
and
some
others
are
only
varieties
of
familiar
species
the
valuable
manual
of
parade
describes
about
the
same
number
including
however
two
of
american
origin
the
locust
and
the
weymouth
or
white
pine
and
the
cedar
of
lebanon
from
asia
though
it
is
indigenous
in
algeria
also
we
may
then
safely
say
that
europe
does
not
possess
above
forty
or
fifty
trees
of
such
economical
value
as
to
be
worth
the
special
care
of
the
forester
while
the
oak
alone
numbers
not
less
than
thirty
species
in
the
united
states
and
some
other
north
american
genera
are
almost
equally
diversified
few
european
trees
except
those
bearing
edible
fruit
have
been
naturalized
in
the
united
states
while
the
american
forest
flora
has
made
large
contributions
to
that
of
europe
it
is
a
very
poor
taste
which
has
led
to
the
substitution
of
the
less
picturesque
european
for
the
graceful
and
majestic
american
elm
in
some
public
grounds
in
the
united
states
on
the
other
hand
the
european
mountain
ash
which
in
beauty
and
healthfulness
of
growth
is
superior
to
our
own
the
horse
chestnut
and
the
abele
or
silver
poplar
are
valuable
additions
to
the
ornamental
trees
of
north
america
the
swiss
arve
or
zirbelkiefer
which
yields
a
edible
seed
and
furnishes
excellent
wood
for
carving
the
umbrella
pine
which
also
bears
a
seed
agreeable
to
the
taste
and
which
from
the
color
of
its
foliage
and
the
beautiful
form
of
its
crown
is
among
the
most
elegant
of
trees
the
white
birch
of
central
europe
with
its
pendulous
branches
almost
rivalling
those
of
the
weeping
willow
in
length
flexibility
and
gracefulness
of
fall
and
especially
the
cypresse
funerall
might
be
introduced
into
the
united
states
with
great
advantage
to
the
landscape
the
european
beech
and
chestnut
furnish
timber
of
far
better
quality
than
that
of
their
american
congeners
the
fruit
of
the
european
chestnut
though
inferior
to
the
american
in
flavor
is
larger
and
is
an
important
article
of
diet
among
the
french
and
italian
peasantry
the
walnut
of
europe
though
not
equal
to
some
of
the
american
species
in
beauty
of
growth
or
of
wood
or
to
others
in
strength
and
elasticity
of
fibre
is
valuable
for
its
timber
and
its
oil
the
maritime
pine
which
has
proved
of
such
immense
use
in
fixing
drifting
sands
in
france
may
perhaps
be
better
adapted
to
this
purpose
than
any
of
the
pines
of
the
new
world
and
it
is
of
great
importance
for
its
turpentine
resin
and
tar
the
épicéa
or
common
fir
abundant
in
the
mountains
of
france
and
the
contiguous
country
is
known
for
its
product
burgundy
pitch
and
as
it
flourishes
in
a
greater
variety
of
soil
and
climate
than
almost
any
other
tree
it
might
be
well
worth
transplantation
the
cork
oak
has
been
introduced
into
the
united
states
i
believe
and
would
undoubtedly
thrive
in
the
southern
section
of
the
union
in
the
walnut
the
chestnut
the
cork
oak
the
mulberry
the
olive
the
orange
the
lemon
the
fig
and
the
multitude
of
other
trees
which
by
their
fruit
or
by
other
products
yield
an
annual
revenue
nature
has
provided
southern
europe
with
a
partial
compensation
for
the
loss
of
the
native
forest
it
is
true
that
these
trees
planted
as
most
of
them
are
at
such
distances
as
to
admit
of
cultivation
or
of
the
growth
of
grass
among
them
are
but
an
inadequate
substitute
for
the
thick
and
shady
wood
but
they
perform
to
a
certain
extent
the
same
offices
of
absorption
and
transpiration
they
shade
the
surface
of
the
ground
they
serve
to
break
the
force
of
the
wind
and
on
many
a
steep
declivity
many
a
bleak
and
barren
hillside
the
chestnut
binds
the
soil
together
with
its
roots
and
prevents
tons
of
earth
and
gravel
from
washing
down
upon
the
fields
and
the
gardens
fruit
trees
are
not
wanting
certainly
north
of
the
alps
the
apple
the
pear
and
the
prune
are
important
in
the
economy
both
of
man
and
of
nature
but
they
are
far
less
numerous
in
switzerland
and
northern
france
than
are
the
trees
i
have
mentioned
in
southern
europe
both
because
they
are
in
general
less
remunerative
and
because
the
climate
in
higher
latitudes
does
not
permit
the
free
introduction
of
shade
trees
into
grounds
occupied
for
agricultural
purposes
the
multitude
of
species
intermixed
as
they
are
in
their
spontaneous
growth
gives
the
american
forest
landscape
a
variety
of
aspect
not
often
seen
in
the
woods
of
europe
and
the
gorgeous
tints
which
nature
repeats
from
the
dying
dolphin
to
paint
the
falling
leaf
of
the
american
maples
oaks
and
ash
trees
clothe
the
hillsides
and
fringe
the
watercourses
with
a
rainbow
splendor
of
foliage
unsurpassed
by
the
brightest
groupings
of
the
tropical
flora
it
must
be
admitted
however
that
both
the
northern
and
the
southern
declivities
of
the
alps
exhibit
a
nearer
approximation
to
this
rich
and
multifarious
coloring
of
autumnal
vegetation
than
most
american
travellers
in
europe
are
willing
to
allow
and
besides
the
small
deciduous
shrubs
which
often
carpet
the
forest
glades
of
these
mountains
are
dyed
with
a
ruddy
and
orange
glow
which
in
the
distant
landscape
is
no
mean
substitute
for
the
scarlet
and
crimson
and
gold
and
amber
of
the
transatlantic
woodland
no
american
evergreen
known
to
me
resembles
the
umbrella
pine
sufficiently
to
be
a
fair
object
of
comparison
with
it
a
cedar
very
common
above
the
highlands
on
the
hudson
is
extremely
like
the
cypress
straight
slender
with
erect
compressed
ramification
and
feathered
to
the
ground
but
its
foliage
is
neither
so
dark
nor
so
dense
the
tree
does
not
attain
the
majestic
height
of
the
cypress
nor
has
it
the
lithe
flexibility
of
that
tree
in
mere
shape
the
lombardy
poplar
nearly
resembles
this
latter
but
it
is
almost
a
profanation
to
compare
the
two
especially
when
they
are
agitated
by
the
wind
for
under
such
circumstances
the
one
is
the
most
majestic
the
other
the
most
ungraceful
or
if
i
may
apply
such
an
expression
to
anything
but
human
affectation
of
movement
the
most
awkward
of
trees
the
poplar
trembles
before
the
blast
flutters
struggles
wildly
dishevels
its
foliage
gropes
around
with
its
feeble
branches
and
hisses
as
in
impotent
passion
the
cypress
gathers
its
limbs
still
more
closely
to
its
stem
bows
a
gracious
salute
rather
than
an
humble
obeisance
to
the
tempest
bends
to
the
wind
with
an
elasticity
that
assures
you
of
its
prompt
return
to
its
regal
attitude
and
sends
from
its
thick
leaflets
a
murmur
like
the
roar
of
the
ocean
the
cypress
and
the
umbrella
pine
are
not
merely
conventional
types
of
the
italian
landscape
they
are
essential
elements
in
a
field
of
rural
beauty
which
can
be
seen
in
perfection
only
in
the
basin
of
the
mediterranean
and
they
are
as
characteristic
of
this
class
of
scenery
as
the
date
palm
is
of
the
oases
of
the
desert
there
is
however
this
difference
a
single
cypress
or
pine
is
often
enough
to
shed
beauty
over
a
wide
area
the
palm
is
a
social
tree
and
its
beauty
is
not
so
much
that
of
the
individual
as
of
the
group
the
frequency
of
the
cypress
and
the
pine
combined
with
the
fact
that
the
other
trees
of
southern
europe
which
most
interest
a
stranger
from
the
north
the
orange
and
the
lemon
the
cork
oak
the
ilex
the
myrtle
and
the
laurel
are
evergreens
goes
far
to
explain
the
beauty
of
the
winter
scenery
of
italy
indeed
it
is
only
in
the
winter
that
a
tourist
who
confines
himself
to
wheel
carriages
and
high
roads
can
acquire
any
notion
of
the
face
of
the
earth
and
form
any
proper
geographical
image
of
that
country
at
other
seasons
not
high
walls
only
but
equally
impervious
hedges
and
now
unhappily
acacias
thickly
planted
along
the
railway
routes
confine
the
view
so
completely
that
the
arch
of
a
tunnel
or
a
night
cap
over
the
traveller
eyes
is
scarcely
a
more
effectual
obstacle
to
the
gratification
of
his
curiosity
the
art
or
as
the
continental
foresters
call
it
the
science
of
sylviculture
has
been
so
little
pursued
in
england
and
america
that
its
nomenclature
has
not
been
introduced
into
the
english
vocabulary
and
i
shall
not
be
able
to
describe
its
processes
with
technical
propriety
of
language
without
occasionally
borrowing
a
word
from
the
forest
literature
of
france
and
germany
a
full
discussion
of
the
methods
of
sylviculture
would
indeed
be
out
of
place
in
a
work
like
the
present
but
the
almost
total
want
of
conveniently
accessible
means
of
information
on
the
subject
in
countries
will
justify
me
in
presenting
it
with
somewhat
more
of
detail
than
would
otherwise
be
pertinent
the
two
best
known
methods
are
those
distinguished
as
the
copse
or
coppice
treatment
and
the
for
which
i
find
no
english
equivalent
but
which
may
not
inappropriately
be
called
the
system
a
copse
or
coppice
is
a
wood
composed
of
shoots
from
the
roots
of
trees
previously
cut
for
fuel
and
timber
the
shoots
are
thinned
out
from
time
to
time
and
finally
cut
either
after
a
fixed
number
of
years
or
after
the
young
trees
have
attained
to
certain
dimensions
their
roots
being
then
left
to
send
out
a
new
progeny
as
before
this
is
the
cheapest
method
of
management
and
therefore
the
best
wherever
the
price
of
labor
and
of
capital
bears
a
high
proportion
to
that
of
land
and
of
timber
but
it
is
essentially
a
wasteful
economy
if
the
woodland
is
in
the
first
place
completely
cut
over
as
is
found
most
convenient
in
practice
the
young
shoots
have
neither
the
shade
nor
the
protection
from
wind
so
important
to
forest
growth
and
their
progress
is
comparatively
slow
while
at
the
same
time
the
thick
clumps
they
form
choke
the
seedlings
that
may
have
sprouted
near
them
if
domestic
animals
of
any
species
are
allowed
to
roam
in
the
wood
they
browse
upon
the
terminal
buds
and
the
tender
branches
thereby
stunting
if
they
do
not
kill
the
young
trees
and
depriving
them
of
all
beauty
and
vigor
of
growth
the
evergreens
once
cut
do
not
shoot
up
again
and
the
mixed
character
of
the
forest
in
many
respects
an
important
advantage
if
not
an
indispensable
condition
of
growth
is
lost
and
besides
this
large
wood
of
any
species
can
not
be
grown
in
this
method
because
trees
which
shoot
from
decaying
stumps
and
their
dying
roots
become
hollow
or
otherwise
unsound
before
they
acquire
their
full
dimensions
a
more
fatal
objection
still
is
that
the
roots
of
trees
will
not
bear
more
than
two
or
three
or
at
most
four
cuttings
of
their
shoots
before
their
vitality
is
exhausted
and
the
wood
can
then
be
restored
only
by
replanting
entirely
the
period
of
cutting
coppices
varies
in
europe
from
fifteen
to
forty
years
according
to
soil
species
and
rapidity
of
growth
in
the
or
system
the
trees
are
allowed
to
stand
as
long
as
they
continue
in
healthy
and
vigorous
growth
this
is
a
shorter
period
than
would
be
at
first
supposed
when
we
consider
the
advanced
age
and
great
dimensions
to
which
under
favorable
circumstances
many
forest
trees
attain
in
temperate
climates
but
as
every
observing
person
familiar
with
the
natural
forest
is
aware
these
are
exceptional
cases
just
as
are
instances
of
great
longevity
or
of
gigantic
stature
among
men
able
vegetable
physiologists
have
maintained
that
the
tree
like
most
reptiles
has
no
natural
limit
of
life
or
of
growth
and
that
the
only
reason
why
our
oaks
and
our
pines
do
not
reach
the
age
of
twenty
centuries
and
the
height
of
a
hundred
fathoms
is
that
in
the
multitude
of
accidents
to
which
they
are
exposed
the
chances
of
their
attaining
to
such
a
length
of
years
and
to
such
dimensions
of
growth
are
a
million
to
one
against
them
but
another
explanation
of
this
fact
is
possible
in
trees
affected
by
no
discoverable
external
cause
of
death
decay
begins
at
the
topmost
branches
which
seem
to
wither
and
die
for
want
of
nutriment
the
mysterious
force
by
which
the
sap
is
carried
from
the
roots
to
the
utmost
twigs
can
not
be
conceived
to
be
unlimited
in
power
and
it
is
probable
that
it
differs
in
different
species
so
that
while
it
may
suffice
to
raise
the
fluid
to
the
height
of
five
hundred
feet
in
the
sequoia
it
may
not
be
able
to
carry
it
beyond
one
hundred
and
fifty
in
the
oak
the
limit
may
be
different
too
in
different
trees
of
the
same
species
not
from
defective
organization
in
those
of
inferior
growth
but
from
more
or
less
favorable
conditions
of
soil
nourishment
and
exposure
whenever
a
tree
attains
to
the
limit
beyond
which
its
circulating
fluids
can
not
rise
we
may
suppose
that
decay
begins
and
death
follows
from
the
same
causes
which
bring
about
the
same
results
in
animals
of
limited
size
such
for
example
as
the
interruption
of
functions
essential
to
life
in
consequence
of
the
clogging
up
of
ducts
by
matter
assimilable
in
the
stage
of
growth
but
no
longer
so
when
increment
has
ceased
in
the
natural
woods
we
observe
that
though
among
the
myriads
of
trees
which
grow
upon
a
square
mile
there
are
several
vegetable
giants
yet
the
great
majority
of
them
begin
to
decay
long
before
they
have
attained
their
maximum
of
stature
and
this
seems
to
be
still
more
emphatically
true
of
the
artificial
forest
in
france
according
to
clavé
oaks
in
a
suitable
soil
may
stand
without
exhibiting
any
sign
of
decay
for
two
or
three
hundred
years
the
pines
hardly
exceed
one
hundred
and
twenty
and
the
soft
or
white
woods
in
wet
soils
languish
and
die
before
reaching
the
fiftieth
year
these
ages
are
certainly
below
the
average
of
those
of
american
forest
trees
and
are
greatly
exceeded
in
very
numerous
instances
of
isolated
trees
in
europe
the
former
mode
of
treating
the
futaie
called
the
garden
system
was
to
cut
the
trees
individually
as
they
arrived
at
maturity
but
in
the
best
regulated
forests
this
practice
has
been
abandoned
for
the
german
method
which
embraces
not
only
the
securing
of
the
largest
immediate
profit
but
the
replanting
of
the
forest
and
the
care
of
the
young
growth
this
is
effected
in
the
case
of
a
forest
whether
natural
or
artificial
which
is
to
be
subjected
to
regular
management
by
three
operations
the
first
of
these
consists
in
felling
about
one
third
of
the
wood
in
such
way
as
to
leave
convenient
spaces
for
the
growth
of
young
trees
the
remaining
are
relied
upon
to
replant
the
vacancies
by
natural
sowing
which
they
seldom
or
never
fail
to
do
the
seedlings
are
watched
are
thinned
out
when
too
dense
the
ill
formed
and
sickly
as
well
as
those
of
inferior
value
and
the
shrubs
and
thorns
which
might
otherwise
choke
or
too
closely
shade
them
are
pulled
up
when
they
have
attained
sufficient
strength
and
development
of
foliage
to
bear
or
to
require
more
light
and
air
the
second
step
is
taken
by
removing
a
suitable
proportion
of
the
old
trees
which
had
been
spared
at
the
first
cutting
and
when
finally
they
are
hardened
enough
to
bear
frost
and
sun
without
other
protection
than
that
which
they
mutually
give
to
each
other
the
remainder
of
the
original
forest
is
felled
and
the
wood
now
consists
wholly
of
young
and
vigorous
trees
this
result
is
obtained
after
about
twenty
years
at
convenient
periods
afterward
the
unhealthy
stocks
and
those
injured
by
wind
or
other
accidents
are
removed
and
in
some
instances
the
growth
of
the
remainder
is
promoted
by
irrigation
or
by
fertilizing
applications
when
the
forest
is
approaching
to
maturity
the
original
processes
already
described
are
repeated
and
as
in
different
parts
of
an
extensive
forest
they
would
take
place
in
different
zones
it
would
afford
indefinitely
an
annual
crop
of
firewood
and
timber
the
duties
of
the
forester
do
not
end
here
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
glades
left
by
felling
the
older
trees
are
not
sufficiently
seeded
or
that
the
species
or
as
the
french
oddly
call
them
are
not
duly
proportioned
in
the
new
crop
in
this
case
seed
must
be
artificially
sown
or
young
trees
planted
in
the
vacancies
one
of
the
most
important
rules
in
the
administration
of
the
forest
is
the
absolute
exclusion
of
domestic
quadrupeds
from
every
wood
which
is
not
destined
to
be
cleared
no
growth
of
young
trees
is
possible
where
cattle
are
admitted
to
pasture
at
any
season
of
the
year
though
they
are
undoubtedly
most
destructive
while
trees
are
in
leaf
it
is
often
necessary
to
take
measures
for
the
protection
of
young
trees
against
the
rabbit
the
mole
and
other
rodent
quadrupeds
and
of
older
ones
against
the
damage
done
by
the
larvæ
of
insects
hatched
upon
the
surface
or
in
the
tissues
of
the
bark
or
even
in
the
wood
itself
the
much
greater
liability
of
the
artificial
than
of
the
natural
forest
to
injury
from
this
cause
is
perhaps
the
only
point
in
which
the
superiority
of
the
former
to
the
latter
is
not
as
marked
as
that
of
any
domesticated
vegetable
to
its
wild
representative
but
the
better
quality
of
the
wood
and
the
much
more
rapid
growth
of
the
trained
and
regulated
forest
are
abundant
compensations
for
the
loss
thus
occasioned
and
the
progress
of
entomological
science
will
perhaps
suggest
new
methods
of
preventing
the
ravages
of
insects
thus
far
however
the
collection
and
destruction
of
the
eggs
by
simple
but
expensive
means
has
proved
the
only
effectual
remedy
it
is
common
in
europe
to
permit
the
removal
of
the
fallen
leaves
and
fragments
of
bark
and
branches
with
which
the
forest
soil
is
covered
and
sometimes
the
cutting
of
the
lower
twigs
of
evergreens
the
leaves
and
twigs
are
principally
used
as
litter
for
cattle
and
finally
as
manure
the
bark
and
branches
as
fuel
by
long
usage
sometimes
by
express
grant
this
privilege
has
become
a
vested
right
of
the
population
in
the
neighborhood
of
many
public
and
even
large
private
forests
but
it
is
generally
regarded
as
a
serious
evil
to
remove
the
leaves
and
fallen
twigs
is
to
withdraw
much
of
the
pabulum
upon
which
the
tree
was
destined
to
feed
the
small
branches
and
leaves
are
the
parts
of
the
tree
which
yield
the
largest
proportion
of
ashes
on
combustion
and
of
course
they
supply
a
great
amount
of
nutriment
for
the
young
shoots
a
cubic
foot
of
twigs
says
vaupell
yields
four
times
as
much
ashes
as
a
cubic
foot
of
stem
wood
for
every
hundred
weight
of
dried
leaves
carried
off
from
a
beech
forest
we
sacrifice
a
hundred
and
sixty
cubic
feet
of
wood
the
leaves
and
the
mosses
are
a
substitute
not
only
for
manure
but
for
ploughing
the
carbonic
acid
given
out
by
decaying
leaves
when
taken
up
by
water
serves
to
dissolve
the
mineral
constituents
of
the
soil
and
is
particularly
active
in
disintegrating
feldspar
and
the
clay
derived
from
its
decomposition
the
leaves
belong
to
the
soil
without
them
it
can
not
preserve
its
fertility
and
can
not
furnish
nutriment
to
the
beech
the
trees
languish
produce
seed
incapable
of
germination
and
the
spontaneous
which
is
an
indispensable
element
in
the
best
systems
of
sylviculture
fails
altogether
in
the
bared
and
impoverished
soil
besides
these
evils
the
removal
of
the
leaves
deprives
the
soil
of
that
spongy
character
which
gives
it
such
immense
value
as
a
reservoir
of
moisture
and
a
regulator
of
the
flow
of
springs
and
finally
it
exposes
the
surface
roots
to
the
drying
influence
of
sun
and
wind
to
accidental
mechanical
injury
from
the
tread
of
animals
or
men
and
in
cold
climates
to
the
destructive
effects
of
frost
the
annual
lopping
and
trimming
of
trees
for
fuel
so
common
in
europe
is
fatal
to
the
higher
uses
of
the
forest
but
where
small
groves
are
made
or
rows
of
trees
planted
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
secure
a
supply
of
firewood
or
to
serve
as
supports
for
the
vine
it
is
often
very
advantageous
the
willows
and
many
other
trees
bear
polling
for
a
long
series
of
years
without
apparent
diminution
of
growth
of
branches
and
though
certainly
a
polled
or
to
use
an
old
english
word
a
doddered
tree
is
in
general
a
melancholy
object
yet
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
aspect
of
some
species
the
american
locust
for
instance
when
young
is
improved
by
this
process
i
have
spoken
of
the
needs
of
agriculture
as
a
principal
cause
of
the
destruction
of
the
forest
and
of
domestic
cattle
as
particularly
injurious
to
the
growth
of
young
trees
but
these
animals
affect
the
forest
indirectly
in
a
still
more
important
way
because
the
extent
of
cleared
ground
required
for
agricultural
use
depends
very
much
on
the
number
and
kinds
of
the
cattle
bred
we
have
seen
in
a
former
chapter
that
in
the
united
states
the
domestic
quadrupeds
amount
to
more
than
a
hundred
millions
or
three
times
the
number
of
the
human
population
of
the
union
in
many
of
the
western
states
the
swine
subsist
more
or
less
on
acorns
nuts
and
other
products
of
the
woods
and
the
prairies
or
natural
meadows
of
the
mississippi
valley
yield
a
large
amount
of
food
for
beast
as
well
as
for
man
with
these
exceptions
all
this
vast
army
of
quadrupeds
is
fed
wholly
on
grass
grain
pulse
and
roots
grown
on
soil
reclaimed
from
the
forest
by
european
settlers
it
is
true
that
the
flesh
of
domestic
quadrupeds
enters
very
largely
into
the
aliment
of
the
american
people
and
greatly
reduces
the
quantity
of
vegetable
nutriment
which
they
would
otherwise
consume
so
that
a
smaller
amount
of
agricultural
product
is
required
for
immediate
human
food
and
of
course
a
smaller
extent
of
cleared
land
is
needed
for
the
growth
of
that
product
than
if
no
domestic
animals
existed
but
the
flesh
of
the
horse
the
ass
and
the
mule
is
not
consumed
by
man
and
the
sheep
is
reared
rather
for
its
fleece
than
for
food
besides
this
the
ground
required
to
produce
the
grass
and
grain
consumed
in
rearing
and
fattening
a
grazing
quadruped
would
yield
a
far
larger
amount
of
nutriment
if
devoted
to
the
growing
of
breadstuffs
than
is
furnished
by
his
flesh
and
upon
the
whole
whatever
advantages
may
be
reaped
from
the
breeding
of
domestic
cattle
it
is
plain
that
the
cleared
land
devoted
to
their
sustenance
in
the
originally
wooded
part
of
the
united
states
after
deducting
a
quantity
sufficient
to
produce
an
amount
of
aliment
equal
to
their
flesh
still
greatly
exceeds
that
cultivated
for
vegetables
directly
consumed
by
the
people
of
the
same
regions
or
to
express
a
nearly
equivalent
idea
in
other
words
the
meadow
and
the
pasture
taken
together
much
exceed
the
plough
land
in
fertile
countries
like
the
united
states
the
foreign
demand
for
animal
and
vegetable
aliment
for
cotton
and
for
tobacco
much
enlarges
the
sphere
of
agricultural
operations
and
of
course
prompts
further
encroachments
upon
the
forest
the
commerce
in
these
articles
therefore
constitutes
in
america
a
special
cause
of
the
destruction
of
the
woods
which
does
not
exist
in
the
numerous
states
of
the
old
world
that
derive
the
raw
material
of
their
mechanical
industry
from
distant
lands
and
import
many
articles
of
vegetable
food
or
luxury
which
their
own
climates
can
not
advantageously
produce
the
growth
of
arboreal
vegetation
is
so
slow
that
though
he
who
buries
an
acorn
may
hope
to
see
it
shoot
up
to
a
miniature
resemblance
of
the
majestic
tree
which
shall
shade
his
remote
descendants
yet
the
longest
life
hardly
embraces
the
seedtime
and
the
harvest
of
a
forest
the
planter
of
a
wood
must
be
actuated
by
higher
motives
than
those
of
an
investment
the
profits
of
which
consist
in
direct
pecuniary
gain
to
himself
or
even
to
his
posterity
for
if
in
rare
cases
an
artificial
forest
may
in
two
or
three
generations
more
than
repay
its
original
cost
still
in
general
the
value
of
its
timber
will
not
return
the
capital
expended
and
the
interest
accrued
but
when
we
consider
the
immense
collateral
advantages
derived
from
the
presence
the
terrible
evils
necessarily
resulting
from
the
destruction
of
the
forest
both
the
preservation
of
existing
woods
and
the
far
more
costly
extension
of
them
where
they
have
been
unduly
reduced
are
among
the
most
obvious
of
the
duties
which
this
age
owes
to
those
that
are
to
come
after
it
especially
is
this
obligation
incumbent
upon
americans
no
civilized
people
profits
so
largely
from
the
toils
and
sacrifices
of
its
immediate
predecessors
as
they
no
generations
have
ever
sown
so
liberally
and
in
their
own
persons
reaped
so
scanty
a
return
as
the
pioneers
of
social
life
we
can
repay
our
debt
to
our
noble
forefathers
only
by
a
like
magnanimity
by
a
like
care
for
the
moral
and
material
interests
of
our
own
posterity
of
american
all
human
institutions
associate
arrangements
modes
of
life
have
their
characteristic
imperfections
the
natural
perhaps
the
necessary
defect
of
ours
is
their
instability
their
want
of
fixedness
not
in
form
only
but
even
in
spirit
the
face
of
physical
nature
in
the
united
states
shares
this
incessant
fluctuation
and
the
landscape
is
as
variable
as
the
habits
of
the
population
it
is
time
for
some
abatement
in
the
restless
love
of
change
which
characterizes
us
and
makes
us
almost
a
nomade
rather
than
a
sedentary
people
we
have
now
felled
forest
enough
everywhere
in
many
districts
far
too
much
let
us
restore
this
one
element
of
material
life
to
its
normal
proportions
and
devise
means
for
maintaining
the
permanence
of
its
relations
to
the
fields
the
meadows
and
the
pastures
to
the
rain
and
the
dews
of
heaven
to
the
springs
and
rivulets
with
which
it
waters
the
earth
the
establishment
of
an
approximately
fixed
ratio
between
the
two
most
broadly
characterized
distinctions
of
rural
surface
woodland
and
plough
land
would
involve
a
certain
persistence
of
character
in
all
the
branches
of
industry
all
the
occupations
and
habits
of
life
which
depend
upon
or
are
immediately
connected
with
either
without
implying
a
rigidity
that
should
exclude
flexibility
of
accommodation
to
the
many
changes
of
external
circumstance
which
human
wisdom
can
neither
prevent
nor
foresee
and
would
thus
help
us
to
become
more
emphatically
a
and
stable
commonwealth
and
not
less
conspicuously
a
people
of
progress
note
on
word
omitted
on
p
sir
john
herschel
and
elsewhere
spells
this
word
because
he
considers
it
a
translation
or
rather
an
adoption
of
the
german
separation
of
the
waters
not
the
slope
the
waters
run
as
a
point
of
historical
etymology
it
is
probable
that
the
word
in
question
was
suggested
to
those
who
first
used
it
by
the
german
but
the
spelling
proposed
by
herschel
is
objectionable
both
because
is
a
combination
of
letters
wholly
unknown
to
modern
english
orthography
and
properly
representing
no
sound
recognized
in
english
orthoepy
and
for
the
still
better
reason
that
in
the
sense
of
has
a
legitimate
english
etymology
the
meant
both
to
separate
or
divide
and
to
shade
or
shelter
it
is
the
root
of
the
english
verbs
and
and
in
the
former
meaning
is
the
equivalent
of
the
german
verb
in

the
meaning

it

the

the
coast
line
and
diminishing
the
area
covered
by
the
waters
he
has
gone
beyond
this
and
invaded
the
realm
of
the
ocean
by
constructing
within
its
borders
wharves
piers
lighthouses
breakwaters
fortresses
and
other
facilities
for
his
commercial
and
military
operations
and
in
some
countries
he
has
permanently
rescued
from
tidal
overflow
and
even
from
the
very
bed
of
the
deep
tracts
of
ground
extensive
enough
to
constitute
valuable
additions
to
his
agricultural
domain
the
quantity
of
soil
gained
from
the
sea
by
these
different
modes
of
acquisition
is
indeed
too
inconsiderable
to
form
an
appreciable
element
in
the
comparison
of
the
general
proportion
between
the
two
great
forms
of
terrestrial
surface
land
and
water
but
the
results
of
such
operations
considered
in
their
physical
and
their
moral
bearings
are
sufficiently
important
to
entitle
them
to
special
notice
in
every
comprehensive
view
of
the
relations
between
man
and
nature
there
are
cases
as
on
the
western
shores
of
the
baltic
where
in
consequence
of
the
secular
elevation
of
the
coast
the
sea
appears
to
be
retiring
others
where
from
the
slow
sinking
of
the
land
it
seems
to
be
advancing
these
movements
depend
upon
geological
causes
wholly
out
of
our
reach
and
man
can
neither
advance
nor
retard
them
there
are
also
cases
where
similar
apparent
effects
are
produced
by
local
oceanic
currents
by
river
deposit
or
erosion
by
tidal
action
or
by
the
influence
of
the
wind
upon
the
waves
and
the
sands
of
the
sea
beach
a
regular
current
may
drift
suspended
earth
and
seaweed
along
a
coast
until
they
are
caught
by
an
eddy
and
finally
deposited
out
of
the
reach
of
further
disturbance
or
it
may
scoop
out
the
bed
of
the
sea
and
undermine
promontories
and
headlands
a
powerful
river
as
the
wind
changes
the
direction
of
its
flow
at
its
outlet
may
wash
away
shores
and
sandbanks
at
one
point
to
deposit
their
material
at
another
the
tide
or
waves
stirred
to
unusual
depths
by
the
wind
may
gradually
wear
down
the
line
of
coast
or
they
may
form
shoals
and
coast
dunes
by
depositing
the
sand
they
have
rolled
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
these
latter
modes
of
action
are
slow
in
producing
effects
sufficiently
important
to
be
noticed
in
general
geography
or
even
to
be
visible
in
the
representations
of
coast
line
laid
down
in
ordinary
maps
but
they
nevertheless
form
conspicuous
features
in
local
topography
and
they
are
attended
with
consequences
of
great
moment
to
the
material
and
the
moral
interests
of
men
the
forces
which
produce
these
results
are
all
in
a
considerable
degree
subject
to
control
or
rather
to
direction
and
resistance
by
human
power
and
it
is
in
guiding
and
combating
them
that
man
has
achieved
some
of
his
most
remarkable
and
honorable
conquests
over
nature
the
triumphs
in
question
or
what
we
generally
call
harbor
and
coast
improvements
whether
we
estimate
their
value
by
the
money
and
labor
expended
upon
them
or
by
their
bearing
upon
the
interests
of
commerce
and
the
arts
of
civilization
must
take
a
very
high
rank
among
the
great
works
of
man
and
they
are
fast
assuming
a
magnitude
greatly
exceeding
their
former
relative
importance
the
extension
of
commerce
and
of
the
military
marine
and
especially
the
introduction
of
vessels
of
increased
burden
and
deeper
draught
of
water
have
imposed
upon
engineers
tasks
of
a
character
which
a
century
ago
would
have
been
pronounced
and
in
fact
would
have
been
impracticable
but
necessity
has
stimulated
an
ingenuity
which
has
contrived
means
of
executing
them
and
which
gives
promise
of
yet
greater
performance
in
time
to
come
men
have
ceased
to
admire
the
power
which
heaped
up
the
great
pyramid
to
gratify
the
pride
of
a
despot
with
a
giant
sepulchre
for
many
great
harbors
many
important
lines
of
internal
communication
in
the
civilized
world
now
exhibit
works
which
surpass
the
vastest
remains
of
ancient
architectural
art
in
mass
and
weight
of
matter
demand
the
exercise
of
far
greater
constructive
skill
and
involve
a
much
heavier
pecuniary
expenditure
than
would
now
be
required
for
the
building
of
the
tomb
of
cheops
it
is
computed
that
the
great
pyramid
the
solid
contents
of
which
when
complete
were
about
cubic
yards
could
be
erected
for
a
million
of
pounds
sterling
the
breakwater
at
cherbourg
founded
in
rough
water
sixty
feet
deep
at
an
average
distance
of
more
than
two
miles
from
the
shore
contains
double
the
mass
of
the
pyramid
and
many
a
comparatively
unimportant
railroad
has
been
constructed
at
twice
the
cost
which
would
now
build
that
stupendous
monument
indeed
although
man
detached
from
the
solid
earth
is
almost
powerless
to
struggle
against
the
sea
he
is
fast
becoming
invincible
by
it
so
long
as
his
foot
is
planted
on
the
shore
or
even
on
the
bottom
of
the
rolling
ocean
and
though
on
some
battle
fields
between
the
waters
and
the
land
he
is
obliged
slowly
to
yield
his
ground
yet
he
retreats
still
facing
the
foe
and
will
finally
be
able
to
say
to
the
sea
thus
far
shalt
thou
come
and
no
farther
and
here
shall
thy
proud
waves
be
stayed
the
description
of
works
of
harbor
and
coast
improvement
which
have
only
an
economical
value
not
a
true
geographical
importance
does
not
come
within
the
plan
of
the
present
volume
and
in
treating
this
branch
of
my
subject
i
shall
confine
myself
to
such
as
are
designed
either
to
gain
new
soil
by
excluding
the
waters
from
grounds
which
they
had
permanently
or
occasionally
covered
or
to
resist
new
encroachments
of
the
sea
upon
the
land
a
of
the
sea
by
the
draining
of
the
lincolnshire
fens
in
england
which
converted
about
acres
of
marsh
pool
and
flat
into
plough
land
and
pasturage
is
a
work
or
rather
series
of
works
of
great
magnitude
and
it
possesses
much
economical
and
indeed
no
trifling
geographical
importance
its
plans
and
methods
were
at
least
in
part
borrowed
from
the
example
of
like
improvements
in
holland
and
it
is
in
difficulty
and
extent
inferior
to
works
executed
for
the
same
purpose
on
the
opposite
coast
of
the
north
sea
by
dutch
frisic
and
low
german
engineers
the
space
i
can
devote
to
such
operations
will
be
better
employed
in
describing
the
latter
and
i
content
myself
with
the
simple
statement
i
have
already
made
of
the
quantity
of
worthless
and
even
pestilential
land
which
has
been
rendered
both
productive
and
salubrious
in
lincolnshire
by
diking
out
the
sea
and
the
rivers
which
traverse
the
fens
of
that
country
the
almost
continued
prevalence
of
west
winds
upon
both
coasts
of
the
german
ocean
occasions
a
constant
set
of
the
currents
of
that
sea
to
the
east
and
both
for
this
reason
and
on
account
of
the
greater
violence
of
storms
from
the
former
quarter
the
english
shores
are
much
less
exposed
to
invasion
by
the
waves
than
those
of
the
netherlands
and
the
provinces
contiguous
to
them
on
the
north
the
old
netherlandish
chronicles
are
filled
with
the
most
startling
accounts
of
the
damage
done
by
the
irruptions
of
the
ocean
from
west
winds
or
extraordinarily
high
tides
at
times
long
before
any
considerable
extent
of
seacoast
was
diked
several
hundreds
of
these
terrible
inundations
are
recorded
and
in
very
many
of
them
the
loss
of
human
lives
is
estimated
as
high
as
one
hundred
thousand
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
that
there
must
be
enormous
exaggeration
in
these
numbers
for
with
all
the
reckless
hardihood
shown
by
men
in
braving
the
dangers
and
privations
attached
by
nature
to
their
birthplace
it
is
inconceivable
that
so
dense
a
population
as
such
wholesale
destruction
of
life
supposes
could
find
the
means
of
subsistence
or
content
itself
to
dwell
on
a
territory
liable
a
dozen
times
in
a
century
to
such
fearful
devastation
there
can
be
no
doubt
however
that
the
low
continental
shores
of
the
german
ocean
very
frequently
suffered
immense
injury
from
inundation
by
the
sea
and
it
is
natural
therefore
that
the
various
arts
of
resistance
to
the
encroachments
of
the
ocean
and
finally
of
aggressive
warfare
upon
its
domain
and
of
permanent
conquest
of
its
territory
should
have
been
earlier
studied
and
carried
to
higher
perfection
in
the
latter
countries
than
in
england
which
had
much
less
to
lose
or
to
gain
by
the
incursions
or
the
retreat
of
the
waters
indeed
although
the
confinement
of
swelling
rivers
by
artificial
embankments
is
of
great
antiquity
i
do
not
know
that
the
defence
or
acquisition
of
land
from
the
sea
by
diking
was
ever
practised
on
a
large
scale
until
systematically
undertaken
by
the
netherlanders
a
few
centuries
after
the
commencement
of
the
christian
era
the
silence
of
the
roman
historians
affords
a
strong
presumption
that
this
art
was
unknown
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
netherlands
at
the
time
of
the
roman
invasion
and
the
elder
pliny
description
of
the
mode
of
life
along
the
coast
which
has
now
been
long
diked
in
applies
precisely
to
the
habits
of
the
people
who
live
on
the
low
islands
and
mainland
flats
lying
outside
of
the
chain
of
dikes
and
wholly
unprotected
by
embankments
of
any
sort
it
has
been
conjectured
and
not
without
probability
that
the
causeways
built
by
the
romans
across
the
marshes
of
the
low
countries
in
their
campaigns
against
the
germanic
tribes
gave
the
natives
the
first
hint
of
the
utility
which
might
be
derived
from
similar
constructions
applied
to
a
different
purpose
if
this
is
so
it
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
among
the
many
instances
in
which
the
arts
and
enginery
of
war
have
been
so
modified
as
to
be
eminently
promotive
of
the
blessings
of
peace
thereby
in
some
measure
compensating
the
wrongs
and
sufferings
they
have
inflicted
on
humanity
the
lowlanders
are
believed
to
have
secured
some
coast
and
bay
islands
by
ring
dikes
and
to
have
embanked
some
fresh
water
channels
as
early
as
the
eighth
or
ninth
century
but
it
does
not
appear
that
sea
dikes
important
enough
to
be
noticed
in
historical
records
were
constructed
on
the
mainland
before
the
thirteenth
century
the
practice
of
draining
inland
accumulation
of
water
whether
fresh
or
salt
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
under
cultivation
the
ground
they
cover
is
of
later
origin
and
is
said
not
to
have
been
adopted
until
after
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
total
amount
of
surface
gained
to
the
agriculture
of
the
netherlands
by
diking
out
the
sea
and
by
draining
shallow
bays
and
lakes
is
estimated
by
staring
at
three
hundred
and
thousand
or
hectares
equal
to
eight
hundred
and
thousand
two
hundred
and
forty
acres
which
is
one
tenth
of
the
area
of
the
kingdom
in
very
many
instances
the
dikes
have
been
partially
in
some
particularly
exposed
localities
totally
destroyed
by
the
violence
of
the
sea
and
the
drained
lands
again
flooded
in
some
cases
the
soil
thus
painfully
won
from
the
ocean
has
been
entirely
lost
in
others
it
has
been
recovered
by
repairing
or
rebuilding
the
dikes
and
pumping
out
the
water
besides
this
the
weight
of
the
dikes
gradually
sinks
them
into
the
soft
soil
beneath
and
this
loss
of
elevation
must
be
compensated
by
raising
the
surface
while
the
increased
burden
thus
added
tends
to
sink
them
still
lower
tetens
declares
says
kohl
that
in
some
places
the
dikes
have
gradually
sunk
to
the
depth
of
sixty
or
even
a
hundred
feet
for
these
reasons
the
processes
of
dike
building
have
been
almost
everywhere
again
and
again
repeated
and
thus
the
total
expenditure
of
money
and
of
labor
upon
the
works
in
question
is
much
greater
than
would
appear
from
an
estimate
of
the
actual
cost
of
a
given
extent
of
coast
land
and
draining
a
given
area
of
water
surface
on
the
other
hand
by
erosion
of
the
coast
line
the
drifting
of
sand
dunes
into
the
interior
and
the
drowning
of
fens
and
morasses
by
incursions
of
the
sea
all
caused
or
at
least
greatly
aggravated
by
human
improvidence
the
netherlands
have
lost
a
far
larger
area
of
land
since
the
commencement
of
the
christian
era
than
they
have
gained
by
diking
and
draining
staring
despairs
of
the
possibility
of
calculating
the
loss
from
the
two
causes
of
destruction
but
he
estimates
that
not
less
than
six
hundred
and
forty
thousand
bunder
or
one
million
five
hundred
and
thousand
acres
of
fen
and
marsh
have
been
washed
away
or
rather
deprived
of
their
vegetable
surface
and
covered
by
water
and
thousand
bunder
or
thousand
four
hundred
acres
of
recovered
land
have
been
lost
by
the
destruction
of
the
dikes
which
protected
them
the
average
value
of
land
gained
from
the
sea
is
estimated
at
about
nineteen
pounds
sterling
or
ninety
dollars
per
acre
while
the
lost
fen
and
morass
was
not
worth
more
than
one
part
of
the
same
price
the
ground
buried
by
the
drifting
of
the
dunes
appears
to
have
been
almost
entirely
of
this
latter
character
and
upon
the
whole
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
soil
added
by
human
industry
to
the
territory
of
the
netherlands
within
the
historical
period
greatly
exceeds
in
pecuniary
value
that
which
has
fallen
a
prey
to
the
waves
during
the
same
era
upon
most
low
and
shelving
coasts
like
those
of
the
netherlands
the
maritime
currents
are
constantly
changing
in
consequence
of
the
variability
of
the
winds
and
the
shifting
of
the
sandbanks
which
the
currents
themselves
now
form
and
now
displace
while
therefore
at
one
point
the
sea
is
advancing
landward
and
requiring
great
effort
to
prevent
the
undermining
and
washing
away
of
the
dikes
it
is
shoaling
at
another
by
its
own
deposits
and
exposing
at
low
water
a
gradually
widening
belt
of
sands
and
ooze
the
coast
lands
selected
for
are
always
at
points
where
the
sea
is
depositing
productive
soil
the
eider
the
elbe
the
weser
the
ems
the
rhine
the
maas
and
the
schelde
bring
down
large
quantities
of
fine
earth
the
prevalence
of
west
winds
prevents
the
waters
from
carrying
this
material
far
out
from
the
coast
and
it
is
at
last
deposited
northward
or
southward
from
the
mouth
of
the
rivers
which
contribute
it
according
to
the
varying
drift
of
the
currents
the
process
of
natural
deposit
which
prepares
the
coast
for
is
thus
described
by
staring
all
soil
is
composed
of
the
same
constituents
first
comes
a
stratum
of
sand
with
marine
shells
or
the
shells
of
mollusks
living
in
brackish
water
if
there
be
tides
and
of
course
flowing
and
ebbing
currents
mud
is
let
fall
upon
the
sand
only
after
the
latter
has
been
raised
above
mark
for
then
only
at
the
change
from
flood
to
ebb
is
the
water
still
enough
to
form
a
deposit
of
so
light
a
material
where
mud
is
found
at
greater
depths
as
for
example
in
a
large
proportion
of
the
ij
it
is
a
proof
that
at
this
point
there
was
never
any
considerable
tidal
flow
or
other
current
the
powerful
tidal
currents
flowing
and
ebbing
twice
a
day
drift
sand
with
them
they
scoop
out
the
bottom
at
one
point
raise
it
at
another
and
the
sandbanks
in
the
current
are
continually
shifting
as
soon
as
a
bank
raises
itself
above
mark
flags
and
reeds
establish
themselves
upon
it
the
mechanical
resistance
of
these
plants
checks
the
retreat
of
the
high
water
and
favors
the
deposit
of
the
earth
suspended
in
it
and
the
formation
of
land
goes
on
with
surprising
rapidity
when
it
has
risen
to
level
it
is
soon
covered
with
grasses
and
becomes
what
is
called
in
zeeland
in
friesland
such
grounds
are
the
foundation
or
starting
point
of
the
process
of
diking
when
they
are
once
elevated
to
the
level
no
more
mud
is
deposited
upon
them
except
by
extraordinary
high
tides
their
further
rise
is
accordingly
very
slow
and
it
is
seldom
advantageous
to
delay
longer
the
operation
of
diking
the
formation
of
new
banks
by
the
sea
is
constantly
going
on
at
points
favorable
for
the
deposit
of
sand
and
earth
and
hence
opportunity
is
continually
afforded
for
enclosure
of
new
land
outside
of

fast
advancing
seaward
and
every
new

security
of

the
province
of
zeeland
consists
of
islands
washed
by
the
sea
on
their
western
coasts
and
separated
by
the
many
channels
through
which
the
schelde
and
some
other
rivers
find
their
way
to
the
ocean
in
the
twelfth
century
these
islands
were
much
smaller
and
more
numerous
than
at
present
they
have
been
gradually
enlarged
and
in
several
instances
at
last
connected
by
the
extension
of
their

goeree
and

consisted
of
separate
islands
containing
altogether
about
ten
thousand
acres
by
means
of
above
sixty
successive
advances
of
the
dikes
they
have
been
brought
to
compose
a
single
island
whose
area
is
not
less
than
sixty
thousand
acres
in
the
netherlands
which
the
first
napoleon
characterized
as
a
deposit
of
the
rhine
and
as
therefore
by
natural
law
rightfully
the
property
of
him
who
controlled
the
sources
of
that
great
river
and
on
the
adjacent
frisic
low
german
and
danish
shores
and
islands
sea
and
river
dikes
have
been
constructed
on
a
grander
and
more
imposing
scale
than
in
any
other
country
the
whole
economy
of
the
art
has
been
there
most
thoroughly
studied
and
the
literature
of
the
subject
is
very
extensive
for
my
present
aim
which
is
concerned
with
results
rather
than
with
processes
it
is
not
worth
while
to
refer
to
professional
treatises
and
i
shall
content
myself
with
presenting
such
information
as
can
be
gathered
from
works
of
a
more
popular
character
the
superior
strata
of
the
lowlands
upon
and
near
the
coast
are
as
we
have
seen
principally
composed
of
soil
brought
down
by
the
great
rivers
i
have
mentioned
and
either
directly
deposited
by
them
upon
the
sands
of
the
bottom
or
carried
out
to
sea
by
their
currents
and
then
after
a
shorter
or
longer
exposure
to
the
chemical
and
mechanical
action
of
salt
water
and
marine
currents
restored
again
to
the
land
by
tidal
overflow
and
subsidence
from
the
waters
in
which
it
was
suspended
at
a
very
remote
period
the
coast
flats
were
at
many
points
raised
so
high
by
successive
alluvious
or
tidal
deposits
as
to
be
above
ordinary
high
water
level
but
they
were
still
liable
to
occasional
inundation
from
river
floods
and
from
the
sea
water
also
when
heavy
or
west
winds
drove
it
landward
the
extraordinary
fertility
of
this
soil
and
its
security
as
a
retreat
from
hostile
violence
attracted
to
it
a
considerable
population
while
its
want
of
protection
against
inundation
exposed
it
to
the
devastations
of
which
the
chroniclers
of
the
middle
ages
have
left
such
highly
colored
pictures
the
first
permanent
dwellings
on
the
coast
flats
were
erected
upon
artificial
mounds
and
many
similar
precarious
habitations
still
exist
on
the
unwalled
islands
and
shores
beyond
the
chain
of
dikes
river
embankments
which
as
is
familiarly
known
have
from
the
earliest
antiquity
been
employed
in
many
countries
where
sea
dikes
are
unknown
were
probably
the
first
works
of
this
character
constructed
in
the
low
countries
and
when
two
neighboring
streams
of
fresh
water
had
been
embanked
the
next
step
in
the
process
would
naturally
be
to
connect
the
river
walls
together
by
a
transverse
dike
or
raised
causeway
which
would
serve
to
secure
the
intermediate
ground
both
against
the
backwater
of
river
floods
and
against
overflow
by
the
sea
the
oldest
true
sea
dikes
described
in
historical
records
however
are
those
enclosing
islands
in
the
estuaries
of
the
great
rivers
and
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
double
character
they
possess
as
a
security
against
maritime
floods
and
as
a
military
rampart
led
to
their
adoption
upon
those
islands
before
similar
constructions
had
been
attempted
upon
the
mainland
at
some
points
of
the
coast
various
contrivances
such
as
piers
piles
and
in
fact
obstructions
of
all
sorts
to
the
ebb
of
the
current
are
employed
to
facilitate
the
deposit
of
slime
before
a
regular
enclosure
is
commenced
usually
however
the
first
step
is
to
build
low
and
cheap
embankments
extending
from
an
older
dike
or
from
high
ground
around
the
parcel
of
flat
intended
to
be
secured
these
are
called
summer
dikes
pl
german
pl
dutch
they
are
erected
when
a
sufficient
extent
of
ground
to
repay
the
cost
has
been
elevated
enough
to
be
covered
with
coarse
vegetation
fit
for
pasturage
they
serve
both
to
secure
the
ground
from
overflow
by
the
ordinary
flood
tides
of
mild
weather
and
to
retain
the
slime
deposited
by
very
high
water
which
would
otherwise
be
partly
carried
off
by
the
retreating
ebb
the
elevation
of
the
soil
goes
on
slowly
after
this
but
when
it
has
at
last
been
sufficiently
enriched
and
raised
high
enough
to
justify
the
necessary
outlay
permanent
dikes
are
constructed
by
which
the
water
is
excluded
at
all
seasons
these
embankments
are
constructed
of
sand
from
the
coast
dunes
or
from
sandbanks
and
of
earth
from
the
mainland
or
from
flats
outside
the
dikes
bound
and
strengthened
by
fascines
and
provided
with
sluices
which
are
generally
founded
on
piles
and
of
very
expensive
construction
for
drainage
at
low
water
the
outward
slope
of
the
sea
dikes
is
gentle
experience
having
shown
that
this
form
is
least
exposed
to
injury
both
from
the
waves
and
from
floating
ice
and
the
most
modern
dikes
are
even
more
moderate
in
the
inclination
of
the
seaward
scarp
than
the
older
ones
the
crown
of
the
dike
however
for
the
last
three
or
four
feet
of
its
height
is
much
steeper
being
intended
rather
as
a
protection
against
the
spray
than
against
the
waves
and
the
inner
slope
is
always
comparatively
abrupt
the
height
and
thickness
of
dikes
varies
according
to
the
elevation
of
the
ground
they
enclose
the
rise
of
the
tides
the
direction
of
the
prevailing
winds
and
other
special
causes
of
exposure
but
it
may
be
said
that
they
are
in
general
raised
from
fifteen
to
twenty
feet
above
ordinary
mark
the
water
slopes
of
river
dikes
are
protected
by
plantations
of
willows
or
strong
shrubs
or
grasses
but
as
these
will
not
grow
upon
banks
exposed
to
salt
water
sea
dikes
must
be
faced
with
stone
fascines
or
some
other
upon
the
coast
of
schleswig
and
holstein
where
the
people
have
less
capital
at
their
command
they
defend
their
embankments
against
ice
and
the
waves
by
a
coating
of
twisted
straw
or
reeds
which
must
be
renewed
as
often
as
once
sometimes
twice
a
year
the
inhabitants
of
these
coasts
call
the
chain
of
dikes
the
golden
border
a
name
it
well
deserves
whether
we
suppose
it
to
refer
to
its
enormous
cost
or
as
is
more
probable
to
its
immense
value
as
a
protection
to
their
fields
and
their
firesides
when
outlying
flats
are
enclosed
by
building
new
embankments
the
old
interior
dikes
are
suffered
to
remain
both
as
an
additional
security
against
the
waves
and
because
the
removal
of
them
would
be
expensive
they
serve
also
as
roads
or
causeways
a
purpose
for
which
the
embankments
nearest
the
sea
are
seldom
employed
because
the
whole
structure
might
be
endangered
from
the
breaking
of
the
turf
by
wheels
and
the
hoofs
of
horses
where
successive
rows
of
dikes
have
been
thus
constructed
it
is
observed
that
the
ground
defended
by
the
more
ancient
embankments
is
lower
than
that
embraced
within
the
newer
enclosures
and
this
depression
of
level
has
been
ascribed
to
a
general
subsidence
of
the
coast
from
geological
causes
but
the
better
opinion
seems
to
be
that
it
is
in
most
cases
due
merely
to
the
consolidation
and
settling
of
the
earth
from
being
more
effectually
dried
from
the
weight
of
the
dikes
from
the
tread
of
men
and
cattle
and
from
the
movement
of
the
heavy
wagons
which
carry
off
the
crops
notwithstanding
this
slow
sinking
most
of
the
land
enclosed
by
dikes
is
still
above
mark
and
can
therefore
be
wholly
or
partially
freed
from
rain
water
and
from
that
received
by
infiltration
from
higher
ground
by
sluices
opened
at
the
ebb
of
the
tide
for
this
purpose
the
land
is
carefully
ditched
and
advantage
is
taken
of
every
favorable
occasion
for
discharging
the
water
through
the
sluices
but
the
ground
can
not
be
effectually
drained
by
this
means
unless
it
is
elevated
four
or
five
feet
at
least
above
the
level
of
the
ebb
tide
because
the
ditches
would
not
otherwise
have
a
sufficient
descent
to
carry
the
water
off
in
the
short
interval
between
ebb
and
flow
and
because
the
moisture
of
the
saturated
subsoil
is
always
rising
by
capillary
attraction
whenever
therefore
the
soil
has
sunk
below
the
level
i
have
mentioned
and
in
cases
where
its
surface
has
never
been
raised
above
it
pumps
worked
by
wind
or
some
other
mechanical
power
must
be
very
frequently
employed
to
keep
the
land
dry
enough
for
pasturage
and
cultivation
b
of
lakes
and
the
substitution
of
steam
engines
for
the
feeble
and
uncertain
action
of
windmills
in
driving
pumps
has
much
facilitated
the
removal
of
water
from
the
polders
and
the
draining
of
lakes
marshes
and
shallow
bays
and
thus
given
such
an
impulse
to
these
enterprises
that
not
less
than
one
hundred
and
ten
thousand
acres
were
reclaimed
from
the
waters
and
added
to
the
agricultural
domain
of
the
netherlands
between
and
the
most
important
of
these
undertakings
was
the
draining
of
the
lake
of
haarlem
and
for
this
purpose
some
of
the
most
powerful
hydraulic
engines
ever
constructed
were
designed
and
executed
the
origin
of
this
lake
is
unknown
it
is
supposed
by
some
geographers
to
be
a
part
of
an
ancient
bed
of
the
rhine
the
channel
of
which
as
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
has
undergone
great
changes
since
the
roman
invasion
of
the
netherlands
by
others
it
is
thought
to
have
once
formed
an
inland
marine
channel
separated
from
the
sea
by
a
chain
of
low
islands
which
the
sand
washed
up
by
the
tides
has
since
connected
with
the
mainland
and
converted
into
a
continuous
line
of
coast
the
best
authorities
however
find
geological
evidence
that
the
surface
occupied
by
the
lake
was
originally
a
marshy
tract
containing
within
its
limits
little
solid
ground
but
many
ponds
and
inlets
and
much
floating
as
well
as
fixed
fen
in
consequence
of
the
cutting
of
turf
for
fuel
and
the
destruction
of
the
few
trees
and
shrubs
which
held
the
loose
soil
together
with
their
roots
the
ponds
are
supposed
to
have
gradually
extended
themselves
until
the
action
of
the
wind
upon
their
enlarged
surface
gave
their
waves
sufficient
force
to
overcome
the
resistance
of
the
feeble
barriers
which
separated
them
and
to
unite
them
all
into
a
single
lake
popular
tradition
it
is
true
ascribes
the
formation
of
the
lake
of
haarlem
to
a
single
irruption
of
the
sea
at
a
remote
period
and
connects
it
with
one
or
another
of
the
destructive
inundations
of
which
the
netherland
chronicles
describe
so
many
but
on
a
map
of
the
year
a
chain
of
four
smaller
waters
occupies
nearly
the
ground
afterward
covered
by
the
lake
of
haarlem
and
they
have
more
probably
been
united
by
gradual
encroachments
resulting
from
the
improvident
practices
above
referred
to
though
no
doubt
the
consummation
may
have
been
hastened
by
floods
and
by
the
neglect
to
maintain
dikes
or
the
intentional
destruction
of
them
in
the
long
wars
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
lake
of
haarlem
was
a
body
of
water
not
far
from
fifteen
miles
in
length
by
seven
in
greatest
width
lying
between
the
cities
of
amsterdam
and
leyden
running
parallel
with
the
coast
of
holland
at
the
distance
of
about
five
miles
from
the
sea
and
covering
an
area
of
about
acres
by
means
of
the
ij
it
communicated
with
the
zuiderzee
the
mediterranean
of
the
netherlands
and
its
surface
was
little
above
the
mean
elevation
of
that
of
the
sea
whenever
therefore
the
waters
of
the
zuiderzee
were
acted
upon
by
strong
northwest
winds
those
of
the
lake
of
haarlem
were
raised
proportionally
and
driven
southward
while
winds
from
the
south
tended
to
create
a
flow
in
the
opposite
direction
the
shores
of
the
lake
were
everywhere
low
and
though
in
the
course
of
the
eighty
years
between
and
more
than
or
had
been
expended
in
checking
its
encroachments
it
often
burst
its
barriers
and
produced
destructive
inundations
on
the
of
november
a
south
wind
brought
its
waters
to
the
very
gates
of
amsterdam
and
on
the
of
december
of
the
same
year
in
a
northwest
gale
they
overflowed
twenty
thousand
acres
of
land
at
the
southern
extremity
of
the
lake
and
flooded
a
part
of
the
city
of
leyden
the
depth
of
water
did
not
in
general
exceed
fourteen
feet
but
the
bottom
was
a
ooze
or
slime
which
partook
of
the
agitation
of
the
waves
and
added
considerably
to
their
mechanical
force
serious
fears
were
entertained
that
the
lake
would
form
a
junction
with
the
inland
waters
of
the
legmeer
and
mijdrecht
swallow
up
a
vast
extent
of
valuable
soil
and
finally
endanger
the
security
of
a
large
proportion
of
the
land
which
the
industry
of
holland
had
gained
in
the
course
of
centuries
from
the
ocean
for
this
reason
and
for
the
sake
of
the
large
addition
the
bottom
of
the
lake
would
make
to
the
cultivable
soil
of
the
state
it
was
resolved
to
drain
it
and
the
preliminary
steps
for
that
purpose
were
commenced
in
the
year
the
first
operation
was
to
surround
the
entire
lake
with
a
ring
canal
and
dike
in
order
to
cut
off
the
communication
with
the
ij
and
to
exclude
the
water
of
the
streams
and
morasses
which
discharged
themselves
into
it
from
the
land
side
the
dike
was
composed
of
different
materials
according
to
the
means
of
supply
at
different
points
such
as
sand
from
the
coast
dunes
earth
and
turf
excavated
from
the
line
of
the
ring
canal
and
floating
turf
fascines
being
everywhere
used
to
bind
and
compact
the
mass
together
this
operation
was
completed
in
and
three
steam
pumps
were
then
employed
for
five
years
in
discharging
the
water
the
whole
enterprise
was
conducted
at
the
expense
of
the
state
and
in
the
recovered
lands
were
offered
for
sale
for
its
benefit
up
to
thousand
acres
had
been
sold
at
not
far
from
sixteen
pounds
sterling
or
dollars
an
acre
amounting
altogether
to
sterling
or
the
unsold
lands
were
valued
at
more
than
or
nearly
and
as
the
total
cost
was
or
about
the
direct
loss
to
the
state
exclusive
of
interest
on
the
capital
expended
may
be
stated
at
or
something
less
than
in
a
country
like
the
united
states
of
almost
boundless
extent
of
sparsely
inhabited
territory
such
an
expenditure
for
such
an
object
would
be
poor
economy
but
holland
has
a
narrow
domain
great
pecuniary
resources
an
excessively
crowded
population
and
a
consequent
need
of
enlarged
room
and
opportunity
for
the
exercise
of
industry
under
such
circumstances
and
especially
with
an
exposure
to
dangers
so
formidable
there
is
no
question
of
the
wisdom
of
the
measure
it
has
already
provided
homes
and
occupation
for
more
than
five
thousand
citizens
and
furnished
a
profitable
investment
for
a
capital
of
not
less
than
sterling
or
which
has
been
expended
in
improvements
over
and
above
the
purchase
money
of
the
soil
and
the
greater
part
of
this
sum
as
well
as
of
the
cost
of
drainage
has
been
paid
as
a
compensation
for
labor
the
excess
of
governmental
expenditure
over
the
receipts
if
employed
in
constructing
ships
of
war
or
fortifications
would
have
added
little
to
the
military
strength
of
the
kingdom
but
the
increase
of
territory
the
multiplication
of
homes
and
firesides
which
the
people
have
an
interest
in
defending
and
the
augmentation
of
agricultural
resources
constitute
a
stronger
bulwark
against
foreign
invasion
than
a
ship
of
the
line
or
a
fortress
armed
with
a
hundred
cannon
the
bearing
of
the
works
i
have
noticed
and
of
others
similar
in
character
upon
the
social
and
moral
as
well
as
the
purely
economical
interests
of
the
people
of
the
netherlands
has
induced
me
to
describe
them
more
in
detail
than
the
general
purpose
of
this
volume
may
be
thought
to
justify
but
if
we
consider
them
simply
from
a
geographical
point
of
view
we
shall
find
that
they
are
possessed
of
no
small
importance
as
modifications
of
the
natural
condition
of
terrestrial
surface
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
before
the
establishment
of
a
partially
civilized
race
upon
the
territory
now
occupied
by
dutch
frisic
and
low
german
communities
the
grounds
not
exposed
to
inundation
were
overgrown
with
dense
woods
that
the
lowlands
between
these
forests
and
the
sea
coasts
were
marshes
covered
and
partially
solidified
by
a
thick
matting
of
peat
plants
and
shrubs
interspersed
with
trees
and
that
even
the
sand
dunes
of
the
shore
were
protected
by
a
vegetable
growth
which
in
a
great
measure
prevented
the
drifting
and
translocation
of
them
the
present
causes
of
river
and
coast
erosion
existed
indeed
at
the
period
in
question
but
some
of
them
must
have
acted
with
less
intensity
there
were
strong
natural
safeguards
against
the
influence
of
marine
and
currents
and
the
conflicting
tendencies
had
arrived
at
a
condition
of
approximate
equilibrium
which
permitted
but
slow
and
gradual
changes
in
the
face
of
nature
the
destruction
of
the
forests
around
the
sources
and
along
the
valleys
of
the
rivers
by
man
gave
them
a
more
torrential
character
the
felling
of
the
trees
and
the
extirpation
of
the
shrubbery
upon
the
fens
by
domestic
cattle
deprived
the
surface
of
cohesion
and
consistence
and
the
cutting
of
peat
for
fuel
opened
cavities
in
it
which
filling
at
once
with
water
rapidly
extended
themselves
by
abrasion
of
their
borders
and
finally
enlarged
to
pools
lakes
and
gulfs
like
the
lake
of
haarlem
and
the
northern
part
of
the
zuiderzee
the
cutting
of
the
wood
and
the
depasturing
of
the
grasses
upon
the
sand
dunes
converted
them
from
solid
bulwarks
against
the
ocean
to
loose
accumulations
of
dust
which
every
sea
breeze
drove
farther
landward
burying
perhaps
fertile
soil
and
choking
up
watercourses
on
one
side
and
exposing
the
coast
to
erosion
by
the
sea
upon
the
other
influence
of
such
the
changes
which
human
action
has
produced
within
twenty
centuries
in
the
netherlands
and
the
neighboring
provinces
are
certainly
of
no
small
geographical
importance
considered
simply
as
a
direct
question
of
loss
and
gain
of
territory
they
have
also
undoubtedly
been
attended
with
some
climatic
consequences
they
have
exercised
a
great
influence
on
the
spontaneous
animal
and
vegetable
life
of
this
region
and
they
can
not
have
failed
to
produce
effects
upon
tidal
and
other
oceanic
currents
the
range
of
which
may
be
very
extensive
the
force
of
the
tidal
wave
the
height
to
which
it
rises
the
direction
of
its
currents
and
in
fact
all
the
phenomena
which
characterize
it
as
well
as
all
the
effects
it
produces
depend
as
much
upon
the
configuration
of
the
coast
it
washes
and
the
depth
of
water
and
form
of
bottom
near
the
shore
as
upon
the
attraction
which
occasions
it
every
one
of
the
terrestrial
conditions
which
affect
the
character
of
tidal
and
other
marine
currents
has
been
very
sensibly
modified
by
the
operations
i
have
described
and
on
this
coast
at
least
man
has
acted
almost
as
powerfully
on
the
physical
geography
of
the
sea
as
on
that
of
the
land
of
the
hydraulic
works
of
the
netherlands
and
of
the
neighboring
states
are
of
such
magnitude
that
they
quite
throw
into
the
shade
all
other
known
artificial
arrangements
for
defending
the
land
against
the
encroachments
of
the
rivers
and
the
sea
and
for
reclaiming
to
the
domain
of
agriculture
and
civilization
soil
long
covered
by
the
waters
but
although
the
recovery
and
protection
of
lands
flooded
by
the
sea
seems
to
be
an
art
wholly
of
netherlandish
origin
we
have
abundant
evidence
that
in
ancient
as
well
as
in
comparatively
modern
times
great
enterprises
more
or
less
analogous
in
character
have
been
successfully
undertaken
both
in
inland
europe
and
in
the
less
familiar
countries
of
the
east
one
of
the
best
known
of
these
is
the
tunnel
which
serves
to
discharge
the
surplus
waters
of
the
lake
of
albano
about
fourteen
miles
from
rome
this
lake
about
six
miles
in
circuit
occupies
one
of
the
craters
of
an
extinct
volcanic
range
and
the
surface
of
its
waters
is
about
nine
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
it
is
fed
by
rivulets
and
subterranean
springs
originating
in
the
alban
mount
or
monte
cavo
the
most
elevated
peak
of
the
volcanic
group
just
mentioned
which
rises
to
the
height
of
about
three
thousand
feet
at
present
the
lake
has
no
discoverable
natural
outlet
but
it
is
not
known
that
the
water
ever
stood
at
such
a
height
as
to
flow
regularly
over
the
lip
of
the
crater
it
seems
that
at
the
earliest
period
of
which
we
have
any
authentic
memorials
its
level
was
usually
kept
by
evaporation
or
by
discharge
through
subterranean
channels
considerably
below
the
rim
of
the
basin
which
encompassed
it
but
in
the
year
the
water
either
from
the
obstruction
of
such
channels
or
in
consequence
of
increased
supplies
from
unknown
sources
rose
to
such
a
height
as
to
flow
over
the
edge
of
the
crater
and
threaten
inundation
to
the
country
below
by
bursting
through
its
walls
to
obviate
this
danger
a
tunnel
for
carrying
off
the
water
was
pierced
at
a
level
much
below
the
height
to
which
it
had
risen
this
gallery
cut
entirely
with
the
chisel
through
the
rock
for
a
distance
of
six
thousand
feet
or
nearly
a
mile
and
one
seventh
is
still
in
so
good
condition
as
to
serve
its
original
purpose
the
fact
that
this
work
was
contemporaneous
with
the
siege
of
veii
has
given
to
ancient
annalists
occasion
to
connect
the
two
events
but
modern
critics
are
inclined
to
reject
livy
account
of
the
matter
as
one
of
the
many
improbable
fables
which
disfigure
the
pages
of
that
historian
it
is
however
repeated
by
cicero
and
by
dionysins
of
halicarnassus
and
it
is
by
no
means
impossible
that
in
an
age
when
priests
and
soothsayers
monopolized
both
the
arts
of
natural
magic
and
the
little
which
yet
existed
of
physical
science
the
government
of
rome
by
their
aid
availed
itself
at
once
of
the
superstition
and
of
the
military
ardor
of
its
citizens
to
obtain
their
sanction
to
an
enterprise
which
sounder
arguments
might
not
have
induced
them
to
approve
still
more
remarkable
is
the
tunnel
cut
by
the
emperor
claudius
to
drain
the
lake
fucinus
now
lago
di
celano
in
the
neapolitan
territory
about
fifty
miles
eastward
of
rome
this
lake
as
far
as
its
history
is
known
has
varied
very
considerably
in
its
dimensions
at
different
periods
according
to
the
character
of
the
seasons
it
has
no
visible
outlet
but
was
originally
either
drained
by
natural
subterranean
conduits
or
kept
within
certain
extreme
limits
by
evaporation
in
years
of
uncommon
moisture
it
spread
over
the
adjacent
soil
and
destroyed
the
crops
in
dry
seasons
it
retreated
and
produced
epidemic
disease
by
poisonous
exhalations
from
the
decay
of
vegetable
and
animal
matter
upon
its
exposed
bed
julius
cæsar
had
proposed
the
construction
of
a
tunnel
to
drain
the
lake
but
the
enterprise
was
not
actually
undertaken
until
the
reign
of
claudius
when
after
a
temporary
failure
from
errors
in
levelling
by
the
engineers
as
was
pretended
at
the
time
or
as
now
appears
certain
in
consequence
of
frauds
by
the
contractors
in
the
execution
of
the
work
it
was
at
least
partially
completed
from
this
imperfect
construction
it
soon
got
out
of
repair
but
was
restored
by
hadrian
and
seems
to
have
answered
its
design
for
some
centuries
in
the
barbarism
which
followed
the
downfall
of
the
empire
it
again
fell
into
decay
and
though
numerous
attempts
were
made
to
repair
it
during
the
middle
ages
no
tolerable
success
seems
to
have
attended
any
of
these
efforts
until
the
present
generation
works
have
now
been
some
years
in
progress
for
restoring
or
rather
enlarging
and
rebuilding
this
ancient
tunnel
upon
a
scale
of
grandeur
which
does
infinite
honor
to
the
liberality
and
public
spirit
of
the
projectors
and
with
an
ingenuity
of
design
and
a
constructive
skill
which
reflect
the
highest
credit
upon
the
professional
ability
of
the
engineers
who
have
planned
the
works
and
directed
their
execution
the
length
of
this
tunnel
is
feet
or
rather
more
than
three
miles
and
a
half
of
course
it
is
one
of
the
longest
subterranean
galleries
yet
executed
in
europe
and
it
offers
many
curious
particulars
in
its
original
design
which
can
not
here
be
described
the
difference
between
the
highest
and
the
lowest
known
levels
of
the
surface
of
the
lake
amounts
to
at
least
forty
feet
and
the
difference
of
area
covered
at
these
respective
stages
is
not
much
less
than
eight
thousand
acres
the
tunnel
will
reduce
the
water
to
a
much
lower
point
and
it
is
computed
that
including
the
lands
occasionally
overflowed
not
less
than
forty
thousand
acres
of
as
fertile
soil
as
any
in
italy
will
be
recovered
from
the
lake
and
permanently
secured
from
inundation
by
its
waters
many
similar
enterprises
have
been
conceived
and
executed
in
modern
times
both
for
the
purpose
of
reclaiming
land
covered
by
water
and
for
sanitary
reasons
they
are
sometimes
attended
with
wholly
unexpected
evils
as
for
example
in
the
case
of
barton
pond
in
vermont
and
in
that
of
the
lake
storsjö
in
sweden
already
mentioned
on
a
former
page
another
still
less
obvious
consequence
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
waters
has
occasionally
been
observed
in
these
operations
the
hydrostatic
force
with
which
the
water
in
virtue
of
its
specific
gravity
presses
against
the
banks
that
confine
it
has
a
tendency
to
sustain
them
whenever
their
composition
and
texture
are
not
such
as
to
expose
them
to
softening
and
dissolution
by
the
infiltration
of
the
water
if
then
the
slope
of
the
banks
is
considerable
or
if
the
earth
of
which
they
are
composed
rests
on
a
smooth
and
slippery
stratum
inclining
toward
the
bed
of
the
lake
they
are
liable
to
fall
or
slide
forward
when
the
mechanical
support
of
the
water
is
removed
and
this
sometimes
happens
on
a
considerable
scale
a
few
years
ago
the
surface
of
the
lake
of
lungern
in
the
canton
of
unterwalden
in
switzerland
was
lowered
by
driving
a
tunnel
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
through
the
narrow
ridge
called
the
kaiserstuhl
which
forms
a
barrier
at
the
north
end
of
the
basin
when
the
water
was
drawn
off
the
banks
which
are
steep
cracked
and
burst
several
acres
of
ground
slid
down
as
low
as
the
water
receded
and
even
the
whole
village
of
lungern
was
thought
to
be
in
no
small
danger
other
inconveniences
of
a
very
serious
character
have
often
resulted
from
the
natural
wearing
down
or
much
more
frequently
the
imprudent
destruction
of
the
barriers
which
confine
mountain
lakes
in
their
natural
condition
such
basins
serve
both
to
receive
and
retain
the
rocks
and
other
detritus
brought
down
by
the
torrents
which
empty
into
them
and
to
check
the
impetus
of
the
rushing
waters
by
bringing
them
to
a
temporary
pause
but
if
the
outlets
are
lowered
so
as
to
drain
the
reservoirs
the
torrents
continue
their
rapid
flow
through
the
ancient
bed
of
the
basins
and
carry
down
with
them
the
sand
and
gravel
with
which
they
are
charged
instead
of
depositing
their
burden
as
before
in
the
still
waters
of
the
lakes
it
is
a
common
opinion
in
america
that
the
river
meadows
bottoms
or
as
they
are
popularly
called
are
generally
the
beds
of
ancient
lakes
which
have
burst
their
barriers
and
left
running
currents
in
their
place
it
was
shown
by
dwight
many
years
ago
that
this
is
very
far
from
being
universally
true
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
mountain
lakes
were
of
much
more
frequent
occurrence
in
primitive
than
in
modern
geography
and
there
are
many
chains
of
such
still
existing
in
regions
where
man
has
yet
little
disturbed
the
original
features
of
the
earth
in
the
long
valleys
of
the
adirondack
range
in
northern
new
york
and
in
the
mountainous
parts
of
maine
eight
ten
and
even
more
lakes
and
lakelets
are
sometimes
found
in
succession
each
emptying
into
the
next
lower
pool
and
so
all
at
last
into
some
considerable
river
when
the
mountain
slopes
which
supply
these
basins
shall
be
stripped
of
their
woods
the
augmented
swelling
of
the
lakes
will
break
down
their
barriers
their
waters
will
run
off
and
the
valleys
will
present
successions
of
flats
with
rivers
running
through
them
instead
of
chains
of
lakes
connected
by
natural
canals
a
similar
state
of
things
seems
to
have
existed
in
the
ancient
geography
of
france
nature
says
lavergne
has
not
excavated
on
the
flanks
of
our
alps
reservoirs
as
magnificent
as
those
of
lombardy
she
had
however
constructed
smaller
but
more
numerous
lakes
which
the
negligence
of
man
has
permitted
to
disappear
auguste
de
gasparin
brother
of
the
illustrious
agriculturist
demonstrated
more
than
thirty
years
ago
in
an
original
paper
that
many
natural
dikes
formerly
existed
in
the
mountain
valleys
which
have
been
swept
away
by
the
waters
he
proposed
to
rebuild
and
to
multiply
them
this
interesting
suggestion
has
reappeared
several
times
since
but
has
met
with
strong
opposition
from
skilful
engineers
it
would
nevertheless
be
well
to
try
the
experiment
of
creating
artificial
lakes
which
should
fill
themselves
with
the
water
of
melting
snows
and
deluging
rains
to
be
drawn
out
in
times
of
drought
if
this
plan
has
able
opposers
it
has
also
warm
advocates
experience
alone
can
decide
the
question
effects
of
draining
lakes
and
the
draining
of
lakes
marshes
and
other
superficial
accumulations
of
moisture
reduces
the
water
surface
of
a
country
and
of
course
the
evaporation
from
it
lakes
too
in
elevated
positions
lose
a
part
of
their
water
by
infiltration
and
thereby
supply
other
lakes
springs
and
rivulets
at
lower
levels
hence
it
is
evident
that
the
draining
of
such
waters
if
carried
on
upon
a
large
scale
must
affect
both
the
humidity
and
the
temperature
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
permanent
supply
of
water
for
extensive
districts
and
climatic

and

of
internal
improvement
such
as

for
the

and
the
like
divert
water
from
its
natural
channels

affect
its
distribution
and
ultimate
discharge
the
collecting
of
the
waters
of
a
considerable
district
into
reservoirs
to
be
thence
carried
off
by
means
of
aqueducts
as
for
example
in
the
forest
of
belgrade
near
constantinople
deprives
the
grounds
originally
watered
by
the
springs
and
rivulets
of
the
necessary
moisture
and
reduces
them
to
barrenness
similar
effects
must
have
followed
from
the
construction
of
the
numerous
aqueducts
which
supplied
ancient
rome
with
such
a
profuse
abundance
of
water
on
the
other
hand
the
filtration
of
water
through
the
banks
or
walls
of
an
aqueduct
carried
upon
a
high
level
across
low
ground
often
injures
the
adjacent
soil
and
is
prejudicial
to
the
health
of
the
neighboring
population
and
it
has
been
observed
in
switzerland
that
fevers
have
been
produced
by
the
stagnation
of
the
water
in
excavations
from
which
earth
had
been
taken
to
form
embankments
for
railways
if
we
consider
only
the
influence
of
physical
improvements
on
civilized
life
we
shall
perhaps
ascribe
to
navigable
canals
a
higher
importance
or
at
least
a
more
diversified
influence
than
to
any
other
works

of
artificial
elaboration
which
would
otherwise
be
worthless
on
account
of
the
cost
of
conveyance
they
supply
from
their
surplus
waters
means
of
irrigation
and
of
mechanical
power
and
in
many
other
ways
they
contribute
much
to
advance
the
prosperity
and
civilization
of
nations
nor
are
they
wholly
without
geographical
importance
they
sometimes
drain
lands
by
conveying
off
water
which
would
otherwise
stagnate
on
the
surface
and
on
the
other
hand
like
aqueducts
they
render
the
neighboring
soil
cold
and
moist
by
the
percolation
of
water
through
their
embankments
they
dam
up
check
and
divert
the
course
of
natural
currents
and
deliver
them
at
points
opposite
to
or
distant
from
their
original
outlets
they
often
require
extensive
reservoirs
to
feed
them
thus
retaining
through
the
year
accumulations
of
water
which
would
otherwise
run
off
or
evaporate
in
the
dry
season
and
thereby
enlarging
the
evaporable
surface
of
the
country
and
we
have
already
seen
that
they
interchange
the
flora
and
the
fauna
of
provinces
widely
separated
by
nature
all
these
modes
of
action
certainly
influence
climate
and
the
character
of
terrestrial
surface
though
our
means
of
observation
are
not
yet
perfected
enough
to
enable
us
to
appreciate
and
measure
their
effects
and
geographical
effects
of
surface
and
underground
i
have
commenced
this
chapter
with
a
description
of
the
dikes
and
other
hydraulic
works
of
the
netherland
engineers
because
the
geographical
results
of
such
operations
are
more
obvious
and
more
easily
measured
though
certainly
not
more
important
than
those
of
the
older
and
more
widely
diffused
modes
of
resisting
or
directing
the
flow
of
waters
which
have
been
practised
from
remote
antiquity
in
the
interior
of
all
civilized
countries
draining
and
irrigation
are
habitually
regarded
as
purely
agricultural
processes
having
little
or
no
relation
to
technical
geography
but
we
shall
find
that
they
exert
a
powerful
influence
on
soil
climate
and
animal
and
vegetable
life
and
may
therefore
justly
claim
to
be
regarded
as
geographical
elements
and
and
their
superficial
draining
is
a
necessity
in
all
lands
newly
reclaimed
from
the
forest
the
face
of
the
ground
in
the
woods
is
never
so
regularly
inclined
as
to
permit
water
to
flow
freely
over
it
there
are
even
on
the
hillsides
many
small
ridges
and
depressions
partly
belonging
to
the
original
distribution
of
the
soil
and
partly
occasioned
by
irregularities
in
the
growth
and
deposit
of
vegetable
matter
these
in
the
husbandry
of
nature
serve
as
dams
and
reservoirs
to
collect
a
larger
supply
of
moisture
than
the
spongy
earth
can
at
once
imbibe
besides
this
the
vegetable
mould
is
even
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
slow
in
parting
with
the
humidity
it
has
accumulated
under
the
protection
of
the
woods
and
the
infiltration
from
neighboring
forests
contributes
to
keep
the
soil
of
small
clearings
too
wet
for
the
advantageous
cultivation
of
artificial
crops
for
these
reasons
surface
draining
must
have
commenced
with
agriculture
itself
and
there
is
probably
no
cultivated
district
one
may
almost
say
no
single
field
which
is
not
provided
with
artificial
arrangements
for
facilitating
the
escape
of
superficial
water
and
thus
carrying
off
moisture
which
in
the
natural
condition
of
the
earth
would
have
been
imbibed
by
the
soil
the
beneficial
effects
of
surface
drainage
the
necessity
of
extending
the
fields
as
population
increased
and
the
inconveniences
resulting
from
the
presence
of
marshes
in
otherwise
improved
regions
must
have
suggested
at
a
very
early
period
of
human
industry
the
expediency
of
converting
bogs
and
swamps
into
dry
land
by
drawing
off
their
waters
and
it
would
not
be
long
after
the
introduction
of
this
practice
before
further
acquisition
of
agricultural
territory
would
be
made
by
lowering
the
outlet
of
small
ponds
and
lakes
and
adding
the
ground
they
covered
to
the
domain
of
the
husbandman
all
these
processes
belong
to
the
incipient
civilization
of
the
periods
but
the
construction
of
subterranean
channels
for
the
removal
of
infiltrated
water
marks
ages
and
countries
distinguished
by
a
great
advance
in
agricultural
theory
and
practice
a
great
accumulation
of
pecuniary
capital
and
a
density
of
population
which
creates
a
ready
demand
and
a
high
price
for
all
products
of
rural
industry
too
would
be
most
advantageous
in
damp
and
cool
climates
where
evaporation
is
slow
and
upon
soils
where
the
natural
inclination
of
surface
does
not
promote
a
very
rapid
flow
of
the
surface
waters
all
the
conditions
required
to
make
this
mode
of
rural
improvement
if
not
absolutely
necessary
at
least
apparently
profitable
exist
in
great
britain
and
it
is
therefore
very
natural
that
the
wealthy
and
intelligent
farmers
of
england
should
have
carried
this
practice
farther
and
reaped
a
more
abundant
pecuniary
return
from
it
than
those
of
any
other
country
besides
superficial
and
subsoil
drains
there
is
another
method
of
disposing
of
superfluous
surface
water
which
however
can
rarely
be
practised
because
the
necessary
conditions
for
its
employment
are
not
of
frequent
occurrence
whenever
a
tenacious
stratum
rests
on
a
loose
gravelly
bed
so
situated
as
to
admit
of
a
free
discharge
of
water
from
or
through
it
by
means
of
the
outcropping
of
the
bed
at
a
lower
level
or
of
conduits
leading
to
distant
points
of
discharge
superficial
waters
may
be
carried
off
by
opening
a
passage
for
them
through
the
impervious
into
the
permeable
stratum
thus
according
to
bischof
as
early
as
the
time
of
king
réné
in
the
first
half
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
plain
of
paluns
near
marseilles
was
laid
dry
by
boring
and
wittwer
informs
us
that
drainage
is
effected
at
munich
by
conducting
the
superfluous
water
into
large
excavations
from
which
it
filters
through
into
a
lower
stratum
of
pebble
and
gravel
lying
a
little
above
the
level
of
the
river
isar
so
at
washington
in
the
western
part
of
the
city
which
lies
high
above
the
rivers
potomac
and
rock
creek
many
houses
are
provided
with
dry
wells
for
draining
their
cellars
and
foundations
these
extend
through
hard
tenacious
earth
to
the
depth
of
thirty
or
forty
feet
when
they
strike
a
stratum
of
gravel
through
which
the
water
readily
passes
off
this
practice
has
been
extensively
employed
at
paris
not
merely
for
carrying
off
ordinary
surface
water
but
for
the
discharge
of
offensive
and
deleterious
fluids
from
chemical
and
manufacturing
establishments
a
well
of
this
sort
received
in
the
winter
of
twenty
thousand
gallons
per
day
of
the
foul
water
from
a
starch
factory
and
the
same
process
was
largely
used
in
other
factories
the
apprehension
of
injury
to
common
and
artesian
wells
and
springs
led
to
an
investigation
on
this
subject
in
behalf
of
the
municipal
authorities
by
girard
and
parent
duchatelet
in
the
latter
year
the
report
of
these
gentlemen
published
in
the
des
ponts
et
for
second
half
year
is
full
of
curious
and
instructive
facts
respecting
the
position
and
distribution
of
the
subterranean
waters
under
and
near
paris
but
it
must
suffice
to
say
that
the
report
came
to
the
conclusion
that
in
consequence
of
the
absolute
immobility
of
these
waters
and
the
relatively
small
quantity
of
noxious
fluid
to
be
conveyed
to
them
there
was
no
danger
of
the
diffusion
of
this
latter
if
discharged
into
them
this
result
will
not
surprise
those
who
know
that
in
another
work
duchatelet
maintains
analogous
opinions
as
to
the
effect
of
the
discharge
of
the
city
sewers
into
the
seine
upon
the
waters
of
that
river
the
quantity
of
matter
delivered
by
them
he
holds
to
be
so
nearly
infinitesimal
as
compared
with
the
volume
of
water
of
the
seine
that
it
can
not
possibly
affect
it
to
a
sensible
degree
i
would
however
advise
determined
water
drinkers
living
at
paris
to
adopt
his
conclusions
without
studying
his
facts
and
his
arguments
for
it
is
quite
possible
that
he
may
convert
his
readers
to
a
faith
opposite
to
his
own
and
that
they
will
finally
agree
with
the
poet
who
held
water
an
ignoble
beverage
and
geographical
effects
of
surface
when
we
remove
water
from
the
surface
we
diminish
the
evaporation
from
it
and
of
course
the
refrigeration
which
accompanies
all
evaporation
is
diminished
in
proportion
hence
superficial
draining
ought
to
be
attended
with
an
elevation
of
atmospheric
temperature
and
in
cold
countries
it
might
be
expected
to
lessen
the
frequency
of
frosts
accordingly
it
is
a
fact
of
experience
that
other
things
being
equal
dry
soils
and
the
air
in
contact
with
them
are
perceptibly
warmer
during
the
season
of
vegetation
when
evaporation
is
most
rapid
than
moist
lands
and
the
atmospheric
stratum
resting
upon
them
instrumental
observation
on
this
special
point
has
not
yet
been
undertaken
on
a
very
large
scale
but
still
we
have
thermometric
data
sufficient
to
warrant
the
general
conclusion
and
the
influence
of
drainage
in
diminishing
the
frequency
of
frost
appears
to
be
even
better
established
than
a
direct
increase
of
atmospheric
temperature
the
steep
and
dry
uplands
of
the
green
mountain
range
in
new
england
often
escape
frosts
when
the
indian
corn
harvest
on
moister
grounds
five
hundred
or
even
a
thousand
feet
lower
is
destroyed
or
greatly
injured
by
them
the
neighborhood
of
a
marsh
is
sure
to
be
exposed
to
late
spring
and
early
autumnal
frosts
but
they
cease
to
be
feared
after
it
is
drained
and
this
is
particularly
observable
in
very
cold
climates
as
for
example
in
lapland
in
england
are
not
generally
laid
below
the
reach
of
daily
variations
of
temperature
or
below
a
point
from
which
moisture
might
be
brought
to
the
surface
by
capillary
attraction
and
evaporated
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
they
therefore
like
surface
drains
withdraw
from
local
solar
action
much
moisture
which
would
otherwise
be
vaporized
by
it
and
at
the
same
time
by
drying
the
soil
above
them
they
increase
its
effective
hygroscopicity
and
it
consequently
absorbs
from
the
atmosphere
a
greater
quantity
of
water
than
it
did
when
for
want
of
the
subsoil
was
always
humid
if
not
saturated
then
contribute
to
the
dryness
as
well
as
to
the
warmth
of
the
atmosphere
and
as
dry
ground
is
more
readily
heated
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
than
wet
they
tend
also
to
raise
the
mean
and
especially
the
summer
temperature
of
the
soil
so
far
as
respects
the
immediate
improvement
of
soil
and
climate
and
the
increased
abundance
of
the
harvests
the
english
system
of
surface
and
subsoil
drainage
has
fully
justified
the
eulogiums
of
its
advocates
but
its
extensive
adoption
appears
to
have
been
attended
with
some
altogether
unforeseen
and
undesirable
consequences
very
analogous
to
those
which
i
have
described
as
resulting
from
the
clearing
of
the
forests
the
carry
off
very
rapidly
the
water
imbibed
by
the
soil
from
precipitation
and
through
infiltration
from
neighboring
springs
or
other
sources
of
supply
consequently
in
wet
seasons
or
after
heavy
rains
a
river
bordered
by
artificially
drained
lands
receives
in
a
few
hours
from
superficial
and
from
subterranean
conduits
an
accession
of
water
which
in
the
natural
state
of
the
earth
would
have
reached
it
only
by
small
instalments
after
percolating
through
hidden
paths
for
weeks
or
even
months
and
would
have
furnished
perennial
and
comparatively
regular
contributions
instead
of
swelling
deluges
to
its
channel
thus
when
human
impatience
rashly
substitutes
swiftly
acting
artificial
contrivances
for
the
slow
methods
by
which
nature
drains
the
surface
and
superficial
strata
of
a
river
basin
the
original
equilibrium
is
disturbed
the
waters
of
the
heavens
are
no
longer
stored
up
in
the
earth
to
be
gradually
given
out
again
but
are
hurried
out
of
man
domain
with
wasteful
haste
and
while
the
inundations
of
the
river
are
sudden
and
disastrous
its
current
when
the
drains
have
run
dry
is
reduced
to
a
rivulet
it
ceases
to
supply
the
power
to
drive
the
machinery
for
which
it
was
once
amply
sufficient
and
scarcely
even
waters
the
herds
that
pasture
upon
its
margin
and
its
climatic
and
geographical
we
know
little
of
the
history
of
the
extinct
civilizations
which
preceded
the
culture
of
the
classic
ages
and
no
nation
has
in
modern
times
spontaneously
emerged
from
barbarism
and
created
for
itself
the
arts
of
social
life
the
improvements
of
the
savage
races
whose
history
we
can
distinctly
trace
are
borrowed
and
imitative
and
our
theories
as
to
the
origin
and
natural
development
of
industrial
art
are
conjectural
of
course
the
relative
antiquity
of
particular
branches
of
human
industry
depends
much
upon
the
natural
character
of
soil
climate
and
spontaneous
vegetable
and
animal
life
in
different
countries
and
while
the
geographical
influence
of
man
would
under
given
circumstances
be
exerted
in
one
direction
it
would
under
different
conditions
act
in
an
opposite
or
a
diverging
line
i
have
given
some
reasons
for
thinking
that
in
the
climates
to
which
our
attention
has
been
chiefly
directed
man
first
interference
with
the
natural
arrangement
and
disposal
of
the
waters
was
in
the
way
of
drainage
of
surface
but
if
we
are
to
judge
from
existing
remains
alone
we
should
probably
conclude
that
irrigation
is
older
than
drainage
for
in
the
regions
regarded
by
general
tradition
as
the
cradle
of
the
human
race
we
find
traces
of
canals
evidently
constructed
for
the
former
purpose
at
a
period
long
preceding
the
ages
of
which
we
have
any
written
memorials
there
are
in
ancient
armenia
extensive
districts
which
were
already
abandoned
to
desolation
at
the
earliest
historical
epoch
but
which
in
a
yet
remoter
antiquity
had
been
irrigated
by
a
complicated
and
highly
artificial
system
of
canals
the
lines
of
which
can
still
be
followed
and
there
are
in
all
the
highlands
where
the
sources
of
the
euphrates
rise
in
persia
in
egypt
in
india
and
in
china
works
of
this
sort
which
must
have
been
in
existence
before
man
had
begun
to
record
his
own
annals
in
warm
countries
such
as
most
of
those
just
mentioned
the
effects
i
have
described
as
usually
resulting
from
the
clearing
of
the
forests
would
very
soon
follow
in
such
climates
the
rains
are
inclined
to
be
periodical
they
are
also
violent
and
for
these
reasons
the
soil
would
be
parched
in
summer
and
liable
to
wash
in
winter
in
these
countries
therefore
the
necessity
for
irrigation
must
soon
have
been
felt
and
its
introduction
into
mountainous
regions
like
armenia
must
have
been
immediately
followed
by
a
system
of
terracing
or
at
least
scarping
the
hillsides
pasture
and
meadow
indeed
may
be
irrigated
even
when
the
surface
is
both
steep
and
irregular
as
may
be
observed
abundantly
on
the
swiss
as
well
as
on
the
piedmontese
slope
of
the
alps
but
in
dry
climates
plough
land
and
gardens
on
hilly
grounds
require
terracing
both
for
supporting
the
soil
and
for
administering
water
by
irrigation
and
it
should
be
remembered
that
terracing
of
itself
even
without
special
arrangements
for
controlling
the
distribution
of
water
prevents
or
at
least
checks
the
flow
of
rain
water
and
gives
it
time
to
sink
into
the
ground
instead
of
running
off
over
the
surface
there
are
few
things
in
continental
husbandry
which
surprise
english
or
american
observers
so
much
as
the
extent
to
which
irrigation
is
employed
in
agriculture
and
that
too
on
soils
and
with
a
temperature
where
their
own
experience
would
have
led
them
to
suppose
it
would
be
injurious
to
vegetation
rather
than
beneficial
to
it
the
summers
in
northern
italy
though
longer
are
very
often
not
warmer
than
in
new
england
and
in
ordinary
years
the
summer
rains
are
as
frequent
and
as
abundant
in
the
former
country
as
in
the
latter
yet
in
piedmont
and
lombardy
irrigation
is
bestowed
upon
almost
every
crop
while
in
new
england
it
is
never
employed
at
all
in
farming
husbandry
or
indeed
for
any
purpose
except
in
kitchen
gardens
and
possibly
in
rare
cases
in
some
other
small
branch
of
agricultural
industry
the
summers
in
egypt
in
syria
and
in
asia
minor
and
even
rumelia
are
almost
rainless
in
such
climates
the
necessity
of
irrigation
is
obvious
and
the
loss
of
the
ancient
means
of
furnishing
it
readily
explains
the
diminished
fertility
of
most
of
the
countries
in
question
the
surface
of
palestine
for
example
is
composed
in
a
great
measure
of
rounded
limestone
hills
once
no
doubt
covered
with
forests
these
were
partially
removed
before
the
jewish
conquest
when
the
soil
began
to
suffer
from
drought
reservoirs
to
retain
the
waters
of
winter
were
hewn
in
the
rock
near
the
tops
of
the
hills
and
the
declivities
were
terraced
so
long
as
the
cisterns
were
in
good
order
and
the
terraces
kept
up
the
fertility
of
palestine
was
unsurpassed
but
when
misgovernment
and
foreign
and
intestine
war
occasioned
the
neglect
or
destruction
of
these
works
traces
of
which
still
meet
the
traveller
eye
at
every
step
when
the
reservoirs
were
broken
and
the
terrace
walls
had
fallen
down
there
was
no
longer
water
for
irrigation
in
summer
the
rains
of
winter
soon
washed
away
most
of
the
thin
layer
of
earth
upon
the
rocks
and
palestine
was
reduced
almost
to
the
condition
of
a
desert
the
course
of
events
has
been
the
same
in
idumæa
the
observing
traveller
discovers
everywhere
about
petra
particularly
if
he
enters
the
city
by
the
route
of
wadi
ksheibeh
very
extensive
traces
of
ancient
cultivation
and
upon
the
neighboring
ridges
are
the
ruins
of
numerous
cisterns
evidently
constructed
to
furnish
a
supply
of
water
for
irrigation
in
primitive
ages
the
precipitation
of
winter
in
these
hilly
countries
was
in
great
part
retained
for
a
time
in
the
superficial
soil
first
by
the
vegetable
mould
of
the
forests
and
then
by
the
artificial
arrangements
i
have
described
the
water
imbibed
by
the
earth
was
partly
taken
up
by
direct
evaporation
partly
absorbed
by
vegetation
and
partly
carried
down
by
infiltration
to
subjacent
strata
which
gave
it
out
in
springs
at
lower
levels
and
thus
a
fertility
of
soil
and
a
condition
of
the
atmosphere
were
maintained
sufficient
to
admit
of
the
dense
population
that
once
inhabited
those
now
arid
wastes
at
present
the
rain
water
runs
immediately
off
from
the
surface
and
is
carried
down
to
the
sea
or
is
drunk
up
by
the
sands
of
the
wadis
and
the
hillsides
which
once
teemed
with
plenty
are
bare
of
vegetation
and
seared
by
the
scorching
winds
of
the
desert
in
southern
europe
in
the
turkish
empire
and
in
many
other
countries
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
surface
is
if
not
absolutely
flooded
at
least
thoroughly
moistened
by
irrigation
a
great
number
of
times
in
the
course
of
every
season
and
this
especially
at
periods
when
it
would
otherwise
be
quite
dry
and
when
too
the
power
of
the
sun
and
the
capacity
of
the
air
for
absorbing
moisture
are
greatest
hence
it
is
obvious
that
the
amount
of
evaporation
from
the
earth
in
these
countries
and
of
course
the
humidity
and
the
temperature
of
both
the
soil
and
the
atmosphere
in
contact
with
it
must
be
much
affected
by
the
practice
of
irrigation
the
cultivable
area
of
egypt
or
the
space
accessible
to
cultivation
between
desert
and
desert
is
more
than
seven
thousand
square
statute
miles
much
of
the
surface
though
not
out
of
the
reach
of
irrigation
lies
too
high
to
be
economically
watered
and
irrigation
and
cultivation
are
therefore
confined
to
an
area
of
five
or
six
thousand
square
miles
nearly
the
whole
of
which
is
regularly
and
constantly
watered
when
not
covered
by
the
inundation
except
in
the
short
interval
between
the
harvest
and
the
rise
of
the
waters
for
nearly
half
of
the
year
then
irrigation
adds
five
or
six
thousand
square
miles
or
more
than
a
square
equatorial
degree
to
the
evaporable
surface
of
the
nile
valley
or
in
other
words
more
than
decuples
the
area
from
which
an
appreciable
quantity
of
moisture
would
otherwise
be
evaporated
for
after
the
nile
has
retired
within
its
banks
its
waters
by
no
means
cover
one
tenth
of
the
space
just
mentioned
the
canals
now
constructing
in
connection
with
the
works
for
the
suez
canal
will
not
only
restore
the
long
abandoned
fields
east
of
the
nile
but
add
to
the
arable
soil
of
egypt
hundreds
of
square
miles
of
newly
reclaimed
desert
and
thus
still
further
increase
the
climatic
effects
of
irrigation
the
nile
receives
not
a
single
tributary
in
its
course
through
egypt
there
is
not
so
much
as
one
living
spring
in
the
whole
land
and
with
the
exception
of
a
narrow
strip
of
coast
where
the
annual
precipitation
is
said
to
amount
to
six
inches
the
fall
of
rain
in
the
territory
of
the
pharaohs
is
not
two
inches
in
the
year
the
subsoil
of
the
whole
valley
is
pervaded
with
moisture
by
infiltration
from
the
nile
and
water
can
everywhere
be
found
at
the
depth
of
a
few
feet
were
irrigation
suspended
and
egypt
abandoned
as
in
that
case
it
must
be
to
the
operations
of
nature
there
is
no
doubt
that
trees
the
roots
of
which
penetrate
deeply
would
in
time
establish
themselves
on
the
deserted
soil
fill
the
valley
with
verdure
and
perhaps
at
last
temper
the
climate
and
even
call
down
abundant
rain
from
the
heavens
but
the
immediate
effect
of
discontinuing
irrigation
would
be
first
an
immense
reduction
of
the
evaporation
from
the
valley
in
the
dry
season
and
then
a
greatly
augmented
dryness
and
heat
of
the
atmosphere
even
the
almost
constant
north
wind
the
strength
of
which
would
be
increased
in
consequence
of
these
changes
would
little
reduce
the
temperature
of
the
narrow
cleft
between
the
burning
mountains
which
hem
in
the
channel
of
the
nile
so
that
a
single
year
would
transform
the
most
fertile
of
soils
to
the
most
barren
of
deserts
and
render
uninhabitable
a
territory
that
irrigation
makes
capable
of
sustaining
as
dense
a
population
as
has
ever
existed
in
any
part
of
the
world
whether
man
found
the
valley
of
the
nile
a
forest
or
such
a
waste
as
i
have
just
described
we
do
not
historically
know
in
either
case
he
has
not
simply
converted
a
wilderness
into
a
garden
but
has
unquestionably
produced
extensive
climatic
change
the
fields
of
egypt
are
more
regularly
watered
than
those
of
any
other
country
bordering
on
the
mediterranean
except
the
rice
grounds
in
italy
and
perhaps
the
or
winter
meadows
of
lombardy
but
irrigation
is
more
or
less
employed
throughout
almost
the
entire
basin
of
that
sea
and
is
everywhere
attended
with
effects
which
if
less
in
degree
are
analogous
in
character
to
those
resulting
from
it
in
egypt
in
general
it
may
be
said
that
the
soil
is
nowhere
artificially
watered
except
when
it
is
so
dry
that
little
moisture
would
be
evaporated
from
it
and
consequently
every
acre
of
irrigated
ground
is
so
much
added
to
the
evaporable
surface
of
the
country
when
the
supply
of
water
is
unlimited
it
is
allowed
after
serving
its
purpose
on
one
field
to
run
into
drains
canals
or
rivers
but
in
most
regions
where
irrigation
is
regularly
employed
it
is
necessary
to
economize
the
water
after
passing
over
or
through
one
parcel
of
ground
it
is
conducted
to
another
no
more
is
withdrawn
from
the
canals
at
any
one
point
than
is
absorbed
by
the
soil
it
irrigates
or
evaporated
from
it
and
consequently
it
is
not
restored
to
liquid
circulation
except
by
infiltration
or
precipitation
we
are
safe
then
in
saying
that
the
humidity
evaporated
from
any
artificially
watered
soil
is
increased
by
a
quantity
bearing
a
large
proportion
to
the
whole
amount
distributed
over
it
for
most
even
of
that
which
is
absorbed
by
the
earth
is
immediately
given
out
again
either
by
vegetables
or
by
evaporation
it
is
not
easy
to
ascertain
precisely
either
the
extent
of
surface
thus
watered
or
the
amount
of
water
supplied
in
any
given
country
because
these
quantities
vary
with
the
character
of
the
season
but
there
are
not
many
districts
in
southern
europe
where
the
management
of
the
arrangements
for
irrigation
is
not
one
of
the
most
important
branches
of
agricultural
labor
the
eminent
engineer
lombardini
describes
the
system
of
irrigation
in
lombardy
as
every
day
in
summer
diffusing
over
hectares
of
land
cubic
mètres
of
water
which
is
equal
to
the
entire
volume
of
the
seine
at
an
ordinary
flood
or
a
rise
of
three
mètres
above
the
hydrometer
at
the
bridge
of
la
tournelle
at
paris
niel
states
the
quantity
of
land
irrigated
in
the
former
kingdom
of
sardinia
including
savoy
in
at
hectares
or
not
much
less
than
acres
this
is
about
four
thirteenths
of
the
cultivable
soil
of
the
kingdom
according
to
the
same
author
the
irrigated
lands
in
france
did
not
exceed
hectares
or
acres
while
those
in
lombardy
amounted
to
hectares
more
than
acres
in
these
three
states
alone
then
there
were
more
than
three
thousand
square
miles
of
artificially
watered
land
and
if
we
add
the
irrigated
soils
of
the
rest
of
italy
of
the
mediterranean
islands
of
the
spanish
peninsula
of
turkey
in
europe
and
in
asia
minor
of
syria
of
egypt
and
the
remainder
of
northern
africa
we
shall
see
that
irrigation
increases
the
evaporable
surface
of
the
mediterranean
basin
by
a
quantity
bearing
no
inconsiderable
proportion
to
the
area
naturally
covered
by
water
within
it
as
near
as
can
be
ascertained
the
amount
of
water
applied
to
irrigated
lands
is
scarcely
anywhere
less
than
the
total
precipitation
during
the
season
of
vegetable
growth
and
in
general
it
much
exceeds
that
quantity
in
grass
grounds
and
in
field
culture
it
ranges
from
or
to
inches
while
in
smaller
crops
tilled
by
hand
labor
it
is
sometimes
carried
as
high
as
inches
the
rice
grounds
and
the
of
lombardy
are
not
included
in
these
estimates
of
the
amount
of
water
applied
arrangements
are
concluded
and
new
plans
proposed
for
an
immense
increase
of
the
lands
fertilized
by
irrigation
in
france
and
italy
and
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
artificially
watered
soil
of
the
latter
country
will
be
doubled
that
of
france
quadrupled
before
the
end
of
this
century
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
by
these
operations
man
is
exercising
a
powerful
influence
on
soil
on
vegetable
and
animal
life
and
on
climate
and
hence
that
in
this
as
in
many
other
fields
of
industry
he
is
truly
a
geographical
agency
the
quantity
of
water
artificially
withdrawn
from
running
streams
for
the
purpose
of
irrigation
is
such
as
very
sensibly
to
affect
their
volume
and
it
is
therefore
an
important
element
in
the
geography
of
rivers
brooks
of
no
trifling
current
are
often
wholly
diverted
from
their
natural
channels
to
supply
the
canals
and
their
entire
mass
of
water
completely
absorbed
so
that
it
does
not
reach
the
river
which
it
naturally
feeds
except
in
such
proportion
as
it
is
conveyed
to
it
by
infiltration
irrigation
therefore
diminishes
great
rivers
in
warm
countries
by
cutting
off
their
sources
of
supply
as
well
as
by
direct
abstraction
of
water
from
their
channels
we
have
just
seen
that
the
system
of
irrigation
in
lombardy
deprives
the
po
of
a
quantity
of
water
equal
to
the
total
delivery
of
the
seine
at
ordinary
flood
or
in
other
words
of
the
equivalent
of
a
tributary
navigable
for
hundreds
of
miles
by
vessels
of
considerable
burden
the
new
canals
commenced
and
projected
will
greatly
increase
the
loss
the
water
required
for
irrigation
in
egypt
is
less
than
would
be
supposed
from
the
exceeding
rapidity
of
evaporation
in
that
arid
climate
for
the
soil
is
thoroughly
saturated
during
the
inundation
and
infiltration
from
the
nile
continues
to
supply
a
considerable
amount
of
humidity
in
the
dryest
season
linant
bey
computed
that
cubic
mètres
per
day
sufficed
to
irrigate
a
hectare
in
the
delta
this
is
equivalent
to
a
fall
of
rain
of
two
millimètres
and
nine
tenths
per
day
or
if
we
suppose
water
to
be
applied
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
days
during
the
dry
season
to
a
total
precipitation
of
millimètres
about
seventeen
inches
and
one
third
taking
the
area
of
actually
cultivated
soil
in
egypt
at
the
low
estimate
of
acres
and
the
average
amount
of
water
daily
applied
in
both
upper
and
lower
egypt
at
twelve
hundredths
of
an
inch
in
depth
we
have
an
abstraction
of
cubic
yards
which
the
mean
daily
delivery
of
the
nile
being
in
round
numbers
cubic
yards
is
nearly
one
fifth
of
the
average
quantity
of
water
contributed
to
the
mediterranean
by
that
river
irrigation
as
employed
for
certain
special
purposes
in
europe
and
america
is
productive
of
very
prejudicial
climatic
effects
i
refer
particularly
to
the
cultivation
of
rice
in
the
slave
states
of
the
american
union
and
in
italy
the
climate
of
the
southern
states
is
not
necessarily
unhealthy
for
the
white
man
but
he
can
scarcely
sleep
a
single
night
in
the
vicinity
of
the
rice
grounds
without
being
attacked
by
a
dangerous
fever
the
neighborhood
of
the
rice
fields
is
less
pestilential
in
lombardy
and
piedmont
than
in
south
carolina
and
georgia
but
still
very
insalubrious
to
both
man
and
beast
not
only
does
the
population
decrease
where
rice
is
grown
says
escourrou
milliago
but
even
the
flocks
are
attacked
by
typhus
in
the
rice
grounds
the
soil
is
divided
into
compartments
rising
in
gradual
succession
to
the
level
of
the
irrigating
canal
in
order
that
the
water
after
having
flowed
one
field
may
be
drawn
off
to
another
and
thus
a
single
current
serve
for
several
compartments
the
lowest
field
of
course
still
being
higher
than
the
ditch
which
at
last
drains
both
it
and
the
adjacent
soil
this
arrangement
gives
a
certain
force
of
hydrostatic
pressure
to
the
water
with
which
the
rice
is
irrigated
and
the
infiltration
from
these
fields
is
said
to
extend
through
neighboring
grounds
sometimes
to
the
distance
of
not
less
than
a
myriamètre
or
six
english
miles
and
to
be
destructive
to
crops
and
even
trees
reached
by
it
land
thus
affected
can
no
longer
be
employed
for
any
purpose
but
growing
rice
and
when
prepared
for
that
crop
it
propagates
still
further
the
evils
under
which
it
had
itself
suffered
and
of
course
the
mischief
is
a
growing
one
the
attentive
traveller
in
egypt
and
nubia
can
not
fail
to
notice
many
localities
generally
of
small
extent
where
the
soil
is
rendered
infertile
by
an
excess
of
saline
matter
in
its
composition
in
many
cases
perhaps
in
all
these
barren
spots
lie
rather
above
the
level
usually
flooded
by
the
inundations
of
the
nile
and
yet
they
exhibit
traces
of
former
cultivation
recent
observations
in
india
a
notice
of
which
i
find
in
an
account
of
a
meeting
of
the
asiatic
society
in
the
athenæum
of
december
no
suggest
a
possible
explanation
of
this
fact
at
this
meeting
professor
medlicott
read
an
essay
on
the
saline
efflorescence
called
and
which
is
gradually
invading
many
of
the
most
fertile
districts
of
northern
and
western
india
and
changing
them
into
sterile
deserts
it
consists
principally
of
sulphate
of
soda
glauber
salts
with
varying
proportions
of
common
salt
medlicott
pronounces
these
salts
which
in
small
quantities
are
favorable
to
fertility
of
soil
to
be
the
gradual
result
of
concentration
by
evaporation
of
river
and
canal
waters
which
contain
them
in
very
minute
quantities
and
with
which
the
lands
are
either
irrigated
or
occasionally
overflowed
the
river
inundations
in
hot
countries
usually
take
place
but
once
in
a
year
and
though
the
banks
remain
submerged
for
days
or
even
weeks
the
water
at
that
period
being
derived
principally
from
rains
and
snows
must
be
less
highly
charged
with
mineral
matter
than
at
lower
stages
and
besides
it
is
always
in
motion
the
water
of
irrigation
on
the
other
hand
is
applied
for
many
months
in
succession
it
is
drawn
from
rivers
at
the
seasons
when
their
proportion
of
salts
is
greatest
and
it
either
sinks
into
the
superficial
soil
carrying
with
it
the
saline
substances
it
holds
in
solution
or
is
evaporated
from
the
surface
leaving
them
upon
it
hence
irrigation
must
impart
to
the
soil
more
salts
than
natural
inundation
the
sterilized
grounds
in
egypt
and
nubia
lying
above
the
reach
of
the
floods
as
i
have
said
we
may
suppose
them
to
have
been
first
cultivated
in
that
remote
antiquity
when
the
nile
valley
received
its
earliest
inhabitants
they
must
have
been
artificially
irrigated
from
the
beginning
they
may
have
been
under
cultivation
many
centuries
before
the
soil
at
a
lower
level
was
invaded
by
man
and
hence
it
is
natural
that
they
should
be
more
strongly
impregnated
with
saline
matter
than
fields
which
are
exposed
every
year
for
some
weeks
to
the
action
of
running
water
so
nearly
pure
that
it
would
be
more
likely
to
dissolve
salts
than
to
deposit
them
inundations
and
torrents
in
pointing
out
in
a
former
chapter
the
evils
which
have
resulted
from
the
too
extensive
destruction
of
the
forests
i
dwelt
at
some
length
on
the
increased
violence
of
river
inundations
and
especially
on
the
devastations
of
torrents
in
countries
improvidently
deprived
of
their
woods
and
i
spoke
of
the
replanting
of
the
forests
as
the
only
effectual
method
of
preventing
the
frequent
recurrence
of
disastrous
floods
there
are
many
regions
where
from
the
loss
of
the
superficial
soil
from
financial
considerations
and
from
other
causes
the
restoration
of
the
woods
is
not
under
present
circumstances
to
be
hoped
for
even
where
that
measure
is
feasible
and
in
actual
process
of
execution
a
great
number
of
years
must
elapse
before
the
action
of
the
destructive
causes
in
question
can
be
arrested
or
perhaps
even
sensibly
mitigated
by
it
besides
this
leaving
out
of
view
the
objections
urged
by
belgrand
and
his
followers
to
the
generally
received
opinions
concerning
the
beneficial
influence
of
the
forest
as
respects
river
inundations
for
no
one
disputes
its
importance
in
preventing
the
formation
and
limiting
the
ravages
of
mountain
torrents
floods
will
always
occur
in
years
of
excessive
precipitation
whether
the
surface
of
the
soil
be
generally
cleared
or
generally
wooded
physical
improvement
in
this
respect
then
can
not
he
confined
to
preventive
measures
but
in
countries
subject
to
damage
by
inundation
means
must
he
contrived
to
obviate
dangers
and
diminish
injuries
to
which
human
life
and
all
the
works
of
human
industry
will
occasionally
be
exposed
in
spite
of
every
effort
to
lessen
the
frequency
of
their
recurrence
by
acting
directly
on
the
causes
that
produce
them
as
every
civilized
country
is
in
some
degree
subject
to
inundation
by
the
overflow
of
rivers
the
evil
is
a
familiar
one
and
needs
no
general
description
in
discussing
this
branch
of
the
subject
therefore
i
may
confine
myself
chiefly
to
the
means
that
have
been
or
may
be
employed
to
resist
the
force
and
limit
the
ravages
of
floods
which
left
wholly
unrestrained
would
not
only
inflict
immense
injury
upon
the
material
interests
of
man
but
produce
geographical
revolutions
of
no
little
magnitude
a
the
most
obvious
and
doubtless
earliest
method
of
preventing
the
escape
of
river
waters
from
their
natural
channels
and
the
overflow
of
fields
and
towns
by
their
spread
is
that
of
raised
embankments
along
their
course
the
necessity
of
such
embankments
usually
arises
from
the
gradual
elevation
of
the
bed
of
running
streams
in
consequence
of
the
deposit
of
the
earth
and
gravel
they
are
charged
with
in
high
water
and
as
we
have
seen
this
elevation
is
rapidly
accelerated
when
the
highlands
around
the
headwaters
of
rivers
are
cleared
of
their
forests
when
a
river
is
embanked
at
a
given
point
and
consequently
the
water
of
its
floods
which
would
otherwise
spread
over
a
wide
surface
is
confined
within
narrow
limits
the
velocity
of
the
current
and
its
transporting
power
are
augmented
and
its
burden
of
sand
and
gravel
is
deposited
at
some
lower
point
where
the
rapidity
of
its
flow
is
checked
by
a
diminution
in
the
inclination
of
the
bed
by
a
wider
channel
or
finally
by
a
lacustrine
or
marine
basin
which
receives
its
waters
wherever
it
lets
fall
solid
material
its
channel
is
raised
in
consequence
and
the
declivity
of
the
whole
bed
between
the
head
of
the
embankment
and
the
slack
of
the
stream
is
reduced
hence
the
current
at
first
accelerated
by
confinement
is
afterward
checked
by
the
mechanical
resistance
of
the
matter
deposited
and
by
the
diminished
inclination
of
its
channel
and
then
begins
again
to
let
fall
the
earth
it
holds
in
suspension
and
to
raise
its
bed
at
the
point
where
its
overflow
had
been
before
prevented
by
embankment
the
bank
must
now
be
raised
in
proportion
and
these
processes
would
be
repeated
and
repeated
indefinitely
had
not
nature
provided
a
remedy
in
floods
which
sweep
out
recent
deposits
burst
the
bonds
of
the
river
and
overwhelm
the
adjacent
country
with
final
desolation
or
divert
the
current
into
a
new
channel
destined
to
become
in
its
turn
the
scene
of
a
similar
struggle
between
man
and
the
waters
few
rivers
like
the
nile
more
than
compensate
by
the
fertilizing
properties
of
their
water
and
their
slime
for
the
damage
they
may
do
in
inundations
and
consequently
there
are
few
whose
floods
are
not
an
object
of
dread
few
whose
encroachments
upon
their
banks
are
not
a
source
of
constant
anxiety
and
expense
to
the
proprietors
of
the
lands
through
which
they
flow
river
dikes
for
confining
the
spread
of
currents
at
high
water
are
of
great
antiquity
in
the
east
and
those
of
the
po
and
its
tributaries
were
begun
before
we
have
any
trustworthy
physical
or
political
annals
of
the
provinces
upon
their
borders
from
the
earliest
ages
the
italian
hydraulic
engineers
have
stood
in
the
front
rank
of
their
profession
and
the
italian
literature
of
this
branch
of
material
improvement
is
exceedingly
voluminous
but
the
countries
for
which
i
write
have
no
rivers
like
the
po
no
plains
like
those
of
lombardy
and
the
dangers
to
which
the
inhabitants
of
english
and
american
river
banks
are
exposed
are
more
nearly
analogous
to
those
that
threaten
the
soil
and
population
in
the
valleys
and
plains
of
france
than
to
the
perils
and
losses
of
the
lombard
the
writings
of
the
italian
hydrographers
too
though
rich
in
professional
instruction
are
less
accessible
to
foreigners
and
less
adapted
to
popular
use
than
those
of
french
engineers
for
these
reasons
i
shall
take
my
citations
principally
from
french
authorities
though
i
shall
occasionally
allude
to
italian
writers
on
the
floods
of
the
tiber
of
the
arno
and
some
other
italian
streams
which
much
resemble
those
of
the
rivers
of
england
and
the
united
states
b
of
the
the
floods
of
mountain
streams
are
attended
with
greater
immediate
danger
to
life
and
property
than
those
of
rivers
of
less
rapid
flow
because
their
currents
are
more
impetuous
and
they
rise
more
suddenly
and
with
less
previous
warning
at
the
same
time
their
ravages
are
confined
within
narrower
limits
the
waters
retire
sooner
to
their
accustomed
channel
and
the
danger
is
more
quickly
over
than
in
the
case
of
inundations
of
larger
rivers
the
ardèche
which
has
given
its
name
to
a
department
in
france
drains
a
basin
of
acres
or
a
little
less
than
nine
hundred
and
square
miles
its
remotest
source
is
about
miles
in
a
straight
line
from
its
junction
with
the
rhone
and
springs
at
an
elevation
of
four
thousand
feet
above
that
point
at
the
lowest
stage
of
the
river
the
bed
of
the
chassezac
its
largest
and
longest
tributary
is
in
many
places
completely
dry
on
the
surface
the
water
being
sufficient
only
to
supply
the
subterranean
channels
of
infiltration
and
the
ardèche
itself
is
almost
everywhere
fordable
even
below
the
mouth
of
the
chassezac
but
in
floods
the
river
has
sometimes
risen
more
than
sixty
feet
at
the
pont
a
natural
arch
of
two
hundred
feet
chord
which
spans
the
stream
below
its
junction
with
all
its
important
affluents
at
the
height
of
the
inundation
of
the
quantity
of
water
passing
this
point
after
deducting
thirty
per
cent
for
material
transported
with
the
current
and
for
irregularity
of
flow
was
estimated
at
cubic
yards
to
the
second
and
between
twelve
at
noon
on
the
of
september
of
that
year
and
ten
the
next
morning
the
water
discharged
through
the
passage
in
question
amounted
to
more
than
cubic
yards
this
quantity
distributed
equally
through
the
basin
of
the
river
would
cover
its
entire
area
to
a
depth
of
more
than
five
inches
the
ardèche
rises
so
suddenly
that
in
the
inundation
of
the
women
who
were
washing
in
the
bed
of
the
river
had
not
time
to
save
their
linen
and
barely
escaped
with
their
lives
though
they
instantly
fled
upon
hearing
the
roar
of
the
approaching
flood
its
waters
and
those
of
its
affluents
fall
almost
as
rapidly
for
in
less
than
hours
after
the
rain
has
ceased
in
the
cévennes
where
it
rises
the
ardèche
returns
within
its
ordinary
channel
even
at
its
junction
with
the
rhone
in
the
flood
of
the
water
at
la
beaume
de
ruoms
on
the
beaume
a
tributary
of
the
ardèche
rose
feet
above
low
water
but
the
stream
was
again
fordable
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
the
inundation
of
was
in
this
respect
exceptional
for
it
continued
three
days
during
which
period
the
ardèche
poured
into
the
rhone
cubic
yards
of
water
the
nile
delivers
into
the
sea
cubic
feet
or
cubic
yards
per
second
on
an
average
of
the
whole
year
this
is
equal
to
cubic
yards
per
day
in
a
single
day
of
flood
then
the
ardèche
a
river
too
insignificant
to
be
known
except
in
the
local
topography
of
france
contributed
to
the
rhone
once
and
a
half
and
for
three
consecutive
days
once
and
one
third
as
much
as
the
average
delivery
of
the
nile
during
the
same
periods
though
the
basin
of
the
latter
river
contains
square
miles
of
surface
or
more
than
five
hundred
times
as
much
as
that
of
the
former
the
average
annual
precipitation
in
the
basin
of
the
ardèche
is
not
greater
than
in
many
other
parts
of
europe
but
excessive
quantities
of
rain
frequently
fall
in
that
valley
in
the
autumn
on
the
of
october
there
fell
at
joyeuse
on
the
beaume
no
less
than
inches
between
three
in
the
morning
and
midnight
such
facts
as
this
explain
the
extraordinary
suddenness
and
violence
of
the
floods
of
the
ardèche
and
the
basins
of
many
other
tributaries
of
the
rhone
exhibit
meteorological
phenomena
not
less
remarkable
the
inundation
of
the
september
was
accompanied
with
a
terrific
hurricane
which
passed
along
the
eastern
slope
of
the
high
grounds
where
the
ardèche
and
several
other
western
affluents
of
the
rhone
take
their
rise
the
wind
tore
up
all
the
trees
in
its
path
and
the
rushing
torrents
bore
their
trunks
down
to
the
larger
streams
which
again
transported
them
to
the
rhone
in
such
rafts
that
one
might
almost
have
crossed
that
river
by
stepping
from
trunk
to
trunk
the
rhone
therefore
is
naturally
subject
to
great
and
sudden
inundations
and
the
same
remark
may
be
applied
to
most
of
the
principal
rivers
of
france
because
the
geographical
character
of
all
of
them
is
approximately
the
same
the
height
and
violence
of
the
inundations
of
most
great
rivers
are
determined
by
the
degree
in
which
the
floods
of
the
different
tributaries
are
coincident
in
time
were
all
the
affluents
of
the
rhone
to
pour
their
highest
annual
floods
into
its
channel
at
once
were
a
dozen
niles
to
empty
themselves
into
its
bed
at
the
same
moment
its
water
would
rise
to
a
height
and
rush
with
an
impetus
that
would
sweep
into
the
mediterranean
the
entire
population
of
its
banks
and
all
the
works
that
man
has
erected
upon
the
plains
which
border
it
but
such
a
coincidence
can
never
happen
the
tributaries
of
this
river
run
in
very
different
directions
and
some
of
them
are
swollen
principally
by
the
melting
of
the
snows
about
their
sources
others
almost
exclusively
by
heavy
rains
when
a
damp
southeast
wind
blows
up
the
valley
of
the
ardèche
its
moisture
is
condensed
and
precipitated
in
a
deluge
upon
the
mountains
which
embosom
the
headwaters
of
that
stream
thus
producing
a
flood
while
a
neighboring
basin
the
axis
of
which
lies
transversely
or
obliquely
to
that
of
the
ardèche
is
not
at
all
affected
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
damage
occasioned
by
such
floods
as
i
have
described
must
be
almost
incalculable
and
it
is
by
no
means
confined
to
the
effects
produced
by
overflow
and
the
mechanical
force
of
the
superficial
currents
in
treating
of
the
devastations
of
torrents
in
a
former
chapter
i
confined
myself
principally
to
the
erosion
of
surface
and
the
transportation
of
mineral
matter
to
lower
grounds
by
them
the
general
action
of
torrents
as
there
shown
tends
to
the
ultimate
elevation
of
their
beds
by
the
deposit
of
the
earth
gravel
and
stone
conveyed
by
them
but
until
they
have
thus
raised
their
outlets
so
as
sensibly
to
diminish
the
inclination
of
their
channels
and
sometimes
when
extraordinary
floods
give
the
torrents
momentum
enough
to
sweep
away
the
accumulations
which
they
have
themselves
heaped
up
the
swift
flow
of
their
currents
aided
by
the
abrasion
of
the
rolling
rocks
and
gravel
scoops
their
beds
constantly
deeper
and
they
consequently
not
only
undermine
their
banks
but
frequently
sap
the
most
solid
foundations
which
the
art
of
man
can
build
for
the
support
of
bridges
and
hydraulic
structures
in
the
inundation
of
the
ardèche
destroyed
a
stone
bridge
near
la
beaume
which
had
been
built
about
eighty
years
before
the
resistance
of
the
piers
which
were
erected
on
piles
the
channel
at
that
point
being
of
gravel
produced
an
eddying
current
that
washed
away
the
bed
of
the
river
above
them
and
the
foundation
thus
deprived
of
lateral
support
yielded
to
the
weight
of
the
bridge
and
the
piles
and
piers
fell
up
stream
by
a
curious
law
of
compensation
the
stream
which
at
flood
scoops
out
cavities
in
its
bed
often
fills
them
up
again
as
soon
as
the
diminished
velocity
of
the
current
allows
it
to
let
fall
the
sand
and
gravel
with
which
it
is
charged
so
that
when
the
waters
return
to
their
usual
channel
the
bottom
shows
no
sign
of
having
been
disturbed
in
a
flood
of
the
escontay

tributary

the
rhone
in
piles
driven
sixteen
feet
into
its
gravelly
bed
for
the
foundation
of
a
pier
were
torn
up
and
carried
off
and
yet
when
the
river
had
fallen
to
mark
the
bottom
at
that
point
appeared
to
have
been
raised
higher
than
it
was
before
the
flood
by
new
deposits
of
sand
and
gravel
while
the
cut
stones
of
the
pier
were
found
buried
to
a
great
depth
in
the
excavation
which
the
water
had
first
washed
out
the
gravel
with
which
rivers
thus
restore
the
level
of
their
beds
is
principally
derived
from
the
crushing
of
the
rocks
brought
down
by
the
mountain
torrents
and
the
destructive
effects
of
inundations
are
immensely
diminished
by
this
reduction
of
large
stones
to
minute
fragments
if
the
blocks
hurled
down
from
the
cliffs
were
transported
unbroken
to
the
channels
of
large
rivers
the
mechanical
force
of
their
movement
would
be
irresistible
they
would
overthrow
the
strongest
barriers
spread
themselves
over
a
surface
as
wide
as
the
flow
of
the
waters
and
convert
the
most
smiling
valleys
into
scenes
of
the
wildest
desolation
force
of
there
are
few
operations
of
nature
where
the
effect
seems
more
disproportioned
to
the
cause
than
in
the
comminution
of
rock
in
the
channel
of
swift
waters
igneous
rocks
are
generally
so
hard
as
to
be
wrought
with
great
difficulty
and
they
bear
the
weight
of
enormous
superstructures
without
yielding
to
the
pressure
but
to
the
torrent
they
are
as
wheat
to
the
millstone
the
streams
which
pour
down
the
southern
scarp
of
the
mediterranean
alps
along
the
riviera
di
ponente
near
genoa

short
courses
and
a
brisk
walk
of
a
couple
of
hours
or
even
less
takes
you
from
the
sea
beach
to
the
headspring
of
many
of
them
in
their
heaviest

they
bring
rounded
masses
of
serpentine
quite
down
to
the

at

is
charged
only
with
finely
divided
particles
of

near
their

filled
with

angular
fragments
intermixed
with

the
almost
total
exclusion
of

the
greatest
depth
of
the
basin
of
the
ardèche
is
miles
but
most
of
its
tributaries
have
a
much
shorter
course
these
affluents
says
mardigny
hurl
into
the
bed
of
the
ardèche
enormous
blocks
of
rock
which
this
river
in
its
turn
bears
onward
and
grinds
down
at
high
water
so
that
its
current
rolls
only

its
confluence
with
the
rhone
guglielmini
argued
that
the
gravel
and
sand
of
the
beds
of
running
streams
were
derived
from
the
trituration
of
rocks
by
the
action
of
the
currents
and
inferred
that
this
action
was
generally
sufficient
to
reduce
hard
rock
to
sand
in
its
passage
from
the
source
to
the
outlet
of
rivers
frisi
controverted
this
opinion
and
maintained
that
river
sand
was
of
more
ancient
origin
and
he
inferred
from
experiments
in
artificially
grinding
stones
that
the
concussion
friction
and
attrition
of
rock
in
the
channel
of
running
waters
were
inadequate
to
its
comminution
though
he
admitted
that
these
same
causes
might
reduce
silicious
sand
to
a
fine
powder
capable
of
transportation
to
the
sea
by
the
currents
frisi
experiments
were
tried
upon
rounded
and
polished
river
pebbles
and
prove
nothing
with
regard
to
the
action
of
torrents
upon
the
irregular
more
or
less
weathered
and
often
cracked
and
shattered
rocks
which
lie
loose
in
the
ground
at
the
head
of
mountain
valleys
the
fury
of
the
waters
and
of
the
wind
which
accompanies
them
in
the
floods
of
the
french
alpine
torrents
is
such
that
large
blocks
of
stone
are
hurled
out
of
the
bed
of
the
stream
to
the
height
of
twelve
or
thirteen
feet
the
impulse
of
masses
driven
with
such
force
overthrows
the
most
solid
masonry
and
their
concussion
can
not
fail
to
be
attended
with
the
crushing

the
rocks

of
in
the
month
of
may
was
remarkable
for
violent
and
almost
uninterrupted
rains
and
most
of
the
river
basins
of
france
were
inundated
to
an
extraordinary
height
in
the
valleys
of
the
loire
and
its
affluents
about
a
million
of
acres
including
many
towns
and
villages
were
laid
under
water
and
the
amount
of
pecuniary
damage
was
almost
incalculable
the
flood
was
not
less
destructive
in
the
valley
of
the
rhone
and
in
fact
an
invasion
by
a
hostile
army
could
hardly
have
been
more
disastrous
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
plains
than
was
this
terrible
deluge
there
had
been
a
flood
of
this
latter
river
in
the
year
which
for
height
and
quantity
of
water
was
almost
as
remarkable
as
that
of
but
it
took
place
in
the
month
of
november
when
the
crops
had
all
been
harvested
and
the
injury
inflicted
by
it
upon
agriculturists
was
therefore
of
a
character
to
be
less
severely
and
less
immediately
felt
than
the
consequences
of
the
inundation
of
in
the
fifteen
years
between
these
two
great
floods
the
population
and
the
rural
improvements
of
the
river
valleys
had
much
increased
common
roads
bridges
and
railways
had
been
multiplied
and
extended
telegraph
lines
had
been
constructed
all
of
which
shared
in
the
general
ruin
and
hence
greater
and
more
diversified
interests
were
affected
by
the
catastrophe
of
than
by
any
former
like
calamity
the
great
flood
of
had
excited
the
attention
and
roused
the
sympathies
of
the
french
people
and
the
subject
was
invested
with
new
interest
by
the
still
more
formidable
character
of
the
inundations
of
it
was
felt
that
these
scourges
had
ceased
to
be
a
matter
of
merely
local
concern
for
although
they
bore
most
heavily
on
those
whose
homes
and
fields
were
situated
within
the
immediate
reach
of
the
swelling
waters
yet
they
frequently
destroyed
harvests
valuable
enough
to
be
a
matter
of
national
interest
endangered
the
personal
security
of
the
population
of
important
political
centres
interrupted
communication
for
days
and
even
weeks
together
on
great
lines
of
traffic
and
travel
thus
severing
as
it
were
all
southwestern
france
from
the
rest
of
the
empire
and
finally
threatened
to
produce
great
and
permanent
geographical
changes
the
of
the
whole
commonwealth
was
seen
to
be
involved
in
preventing
the
recurrence
and
in
limiting
the
range
of
such
devastations
the
government
encouraged
scientific
investigation
of
the
phenomena
and
their
laws
their
causes
their
history
their
immediate
and
remote
consequences
and
the
possible
safeguards
to
be
employed
against
them
have
been
carefully
studied
by
the
most
eminent
physicists
as
well
as
by
the
ablest
theoretical
and
practical
engineers
of
france
many
hitherto
unobserved
facts
have
been
collected
many
new
hypotheses
suggested
and
many
plans
more
or
less
original
in
character
have
been
devised
for
combating
the
evil
but
thus
far
the
most
competent
judges
are
not
well
agreed
as
to
the
mode
or
even
the
possibility
of
applying
a
remedy
against
perhaps
no
one
point
has
been
more
prominent
in
the
discussions
than
the
influence
of
the
forest
in
equalizing
and
regulating
the
flow
of
the
water
of
precipitation
as
we
have
already
seen
opinion
is
still
somewhat
divided
on
this
subject
but
the
conservative
action
of
the
woods
in
this
respect
has
been
generally
recognized
by
the
public
of
france
and
the
government
of
the
empire
has
made
this
principle
the
basis
of
important
legislation
for
the
protection
of
existing
forests
and
for
the
formation
of
new
the
clearing
of
woodland
and
the
organization
and
functions
of
a
police
for
its
protection
are
regulated
by
a
law
bearing
date
june
and
provision
was
made
for
promoting
the
restoration
of
private
woods
by
a
statute
adopted
on
the
of
july
the
former
of
these
laws
passed
the
legislative
body
by
a
vote
of
against
the
latter
with
but
a
single
negative
voice
the
influence
of
the
government
in
a
country
where
the
throne
is
so
potent
as
in
france
would
account
for
a
large
majority
but
when
it
is
considered
that
both
laws
the
former
especially
interfere
very
materially
with
the
rights
of
private
domain
the
almost
entire
unanimity
with
which
they
were
adopted
is
proof
of
a
very
general
popular
conviction
that
the
protection
and
extension
of
the
forests
is
a
measure
more
likely
than
any
other
to
check
the
violence
if
not
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
destructive
inundations
the
law
of
july
appropriated
francs
to
be
expended
at
the
rate
of
francs
per
year
in
executing
or
aiding
the
replanting
of
woods
it
is
computed
that
this
appropriation
will
secure
the
creation
of
new
forest
to
the
extent
of
about
acres
or
one
eleventh
part
of
the
soil
where
the
restoration
of
the
forest
is
thought
feasible
and
at
the
same
time
specially
important
as
a
security
against
the
evils
ascribed
in
a
great
measure
to
its
destruction
the
provisions
of
the
laws
in
question
are
preventive
rather
than
remedial
but
some
immediate
effect
may
be
expected
to
result
from
them
particularly
if
they
are
accompanied
with
certain
other
measures
the
suggestion
of
which
has
been
favorably
received
the
strong
repugnance
of
the
mountaineers
to
the
application
of
a
system
which
deprives
them
of
a
part
of
their
pasturage
for
the
absolute
exclusion
of
domestic
animals
is
indispensable
to
the
maintenance
of
an
existing
forest
and
to
the
formation
of
a
new
is
the
most
formidable
obstacle
to
the
execution
of
the
laws
of
it
is
proposed
to
compensate
this
loss
by
a
cheap
system
of
irrigation
of
lower
pasture
grounds
consisting
in
little
more
than
in
running
horizontal
furrows
along
the
hillsides
thus
converting
the
scarp
of
the
hills
into
a
succession
of
small
terraces
which
when
once
turfed
over
are
very
permanent
experience
is
said
to
have
demonstrated
that
this
simple
process
suffices
to
retain
the
water
of
rains
of
snows
and
of
small
springs
and
rivulets
long
enough
for
the
irrigation
of
the
soil
thus
increasing
its
product
of
herbage
in
a
fivefold
proportion
and
that
it
partially
checks
the
too
rapid
flow
of
surface
water
into
the
valleys
and
consequently
in
some
measure
obviates
one
of
the
most
prominent
causes
of
inundations
it
is
evident
that
if
such
results
are
produced
by
this
method
its
introduction
upon
an
extensive
scale
must
also
have
the
same
climatic
effects
as
other
systems
of
irrigation
whatever
may
be
the
ultimate
advantages
of
reclothing
a
large
extent
of
the
territory
of
france
with
wood
or
of
so
shaping
its
surface
as
to
prevent
the
too
rapid
flow
of
water
over
it
the
results
to
be
obtained
by
such
processes
can
be
realized
in
an
adequate
measure
only
after
a
long
succession
of
years
other
steps
must
be
taken
both
for
the
immediate
security
of
the
lives
and
property
of
the
present
generation
and
for
the
prevention
of
yet
greater
and
remoter
evils
which
are
inevitable
unless
means
to
obviate
them
are
found
before
it
is
forever
too
late
the
frequent
recurrence
of
inundations
like
those
of
for
a
single
score
of
years
in
the
basins
of
the
rhone
and
the
loire
with
only
the
present
securities
against
them
would
almost
depopulate
the
valleys
of
those
rivers
and
produce
physical
revolutions
in
them
which
like
revolutions
in
the
political
world
could
never
be
made
to
go
backward
destructive
inundations
are
seldom
if
ever
produced
by
precipitation
within
the
limits
of
the
principal
valley
but
almost
uniformly
by
sudden
thaws
or
excessive
rains
on
the
mountain
ranges
where
the
tributaries
take
their
rise
it
is
therefore
plain
that
any
measures
which
shall
check
the
flow
of
surface
waters
into
the
channels
of
the
affluents
or
which
shall
retard
the
delivery
of
such
waters
into
the
principal
stream
by
its
tributaries
will
diminish
in
the
same
proportion
the
dangers
and
the
evils
of
inundation
by
great
rivers
the
retention
of
the
surface
waters
upon
or
in
the
soil
can
hardly
be
accomplished
except
by
the
methods
already
mentioned
replanting
of
forests
and
furrowing
or
terracing
the
current
of
mountain
streams
can
be
checked
by
various
methods
among
which
the
most
familiar
and
obvious
is
the
erection
of
barriers
or
dams
across
their
channels
at
points
convenient
for
forming
reservoirs
large
enough
to
retain
the
superfluous
waters
of
great
rains
and
thaws
besides
the
utility
of
such
basins
in
preventing
floods
the
construction
of
them
is
recommended
by
very
strong
considerations
such
as
the
meteorological
effects
of
increased
evaporable
surface
the
furnishing
of
a
constant
supply
of
water
for
agricultural
and
mechanical
purposes
and
finally
their
value
as
ponds
for
breeding
and
rearing
fish
and
perhaps
for
cultivating
aquatic
vegetables
the
objections
to
the
general
adoption
of
the
system
of
reservoirs
are
these
the
expense
of
their
construction
and
maintenance
the
reduction
of
cultivable
area
by
the
amount
of
surface
they
must
cover
the
interruption
they
would
occasion
to
free
communication
the
probability
that
they
would
soon
be
filled
up
with
sediment
and
the
obvious
fact
that
when
full
of
earth
or
even
water
they
would
no
longer
serve
their
principal
purpose
the
great
danger
to
which
they
would
expose
the
country
below
them
in
case
of
the
bursting
of
their
barriers
the
evil
consequences
they
would
occasion
by
prolonging
the
flow
of
inundations
in
proportion
as
they
diminished
their
height
the
injurious
effects
it
is
supposed
they
would
produce
upon
the
salubrity
of
the
neighboring
districts
and
lastly
the
alleged
impossibility
of
constructing
artificial
basins
sufficient
in
capacity
to
prevent
or
in
any
considerable
measure
to
mitigate
the
evils
they
are
intended
to
guard
against
the
last
argument
is
more
easily
reduced
to
a
numerical
question
than
the
others
the
mean
and
extreme
annual
precipitation
of
all
the
basins
where
the
construction
of
such
works
would
be
seriously
proposed
is
already
approximately
known
by
meteorological
tables
and
the
quantity
of
water
delivered
by
the
greatest
floods
which
have
occurred
within
the
memory
of
man
may
be
roughly
estimated
from
their
visible
traces
from
these
elements
or
from
recorded
observations
the
capacity
of
the
necessary
reservoirs
can
be
calculated
let
us
take
the
case
of
the
ardèche
in
the
inundation
of
that
river
poured
into
the
rhone
cubic
yards
of
water
in
three
days
if
we
suppose
that
half
this
quantity
might
have
been
suffered
to
flow
down
its
channel
without
inconvenience
we
shall
have
about
cubic
yards
to
provide
for
by
reservoirs
the
ardèche
and
its
principal
affluent
the
chassezac
have
together
about
twelve
considerable
tributaries
rising
near
the
crest
of
the
mountains
which
bound
the
basin
if
reservoirs
of
equal
capacity
were
constructed
upon
all
of
them
each
reservoir
must
be
able
to
contain
cubic
yards
or
in
other
words
must
be
equal
to
a
lake
yards
long
yards
wide
and
yards
deep
and
besides
in
order
to
render
any
effectual
service
the
reservoirs
must
all
have
been
empty
at
the
commencement
of
the
rains
which
produced
the
inundation
thus
far
i
have
supposed
the
swelling
of
the
waters
to
be
uniform
throughout
the
whole
basin
but
such
was
by
no
means
the
fact
in
the
inundation
of
for
the
rise
of
the
chassezac
which
is
as
large
as
the
ardèche
proper
did
not
exceed
the
limits
of
ordinary
floods
and
the
dangerous
excess
came
solely
from
the
headwaters
of
the
latter
stream
hence
reservoirs
of
double
the
capacity
i
have
supposed
would
have
been
necessary
upon
the
tributaries
of
that
river
to
prevent
the
injurious
effects
of
the
inundation
it
is
evident
that
the
construction
of
reservoirs
of
such
magnitude
for
such
a
purpose
is
financially
if
not
physically
impracticable
and
when
we
take
into
account
a
point
i
have
just
suggested
namely
that
the
reservoirs
must
be
empty
at
all
times
of
apprehended
flood
and
of
course
their
utility
limited
almost
solely
to
the
single
object
of
preventing
inundations
the
total
inapplicability
of
such
a
measure
in
this
particular
case
becomes
still
more
glaringly
manifest
another
not
less
conclusive
fact
is
that
the
valleys
of
all
the
upland
tributaries
of
the
ardèche
descend
so
rapidly
and
have
so
little
lateral
expansion
as
to
render
the
construction
of
capacious
reservoirs
in
them
quite
impracticable
indeed
engineers
have
found
but
two
points
in
the
whole
basin
suitable
for
that
purpose
and
the
reservoirs
admissible
at
these
would
have
only
a
joint
capacity
of
about
cubic
yards
or
less
than
one
ninth
part
of
what
i
suppose
to
be
required
the
case
of
the
ardèche
is
no
doubt
an
extreme
one
both
in
the
topographical
character
of
its
basin
and
in
its
exposure
to
excessive
rains
but
all
destructive
inundations
are
in
a
certain
sense
extreme
cases
also
and
this
of
the
ardèche
serves
to
show
that
the
construction
of
reservoirs
is
not
by
any
means
to
be
regarded
as
a
universal
panacea
against
floods
nor
on
the
other
hand
is
this
measure
to
be
summarily
rejected
nature
has
adopted
it
on
a
great
scale
on
both
flanks
of
the
alps
and
on
a
smaller
on
those
of
the
adirondacks
and
lower
chains
and
in
this
as
in
many
other
instances
her
processes
may
often
be
imitated
with
advantage
the
validity
of
the
remaining
objections
to
the
system
under
discussion
depends
on
the
topography
geology
and
special
climate
of
the
regions
where
it
is
proposed
to
establish
such
reservoirs
many
upland
streams
present
numerous
points
where
none
of
these
objections
except
those
of
expense
and
of
danger
from
the
breaking
of
dams
could
have
any
application
reservoirs
may
be
so
constructed
as
to
retain
the
entire
precipitation
of
the
heaviest
thaws
and
rains
leaving
only
the
ordinary
quantity
to
flow
along
the
channel
they
may
be
raised
to
such
a
height
as
only
partially
to
obstruct
the
surface
drainage
or
they
may
be
provided
with
sluices
by
means
of
which
their
whole
contents
can
be
discharged
in
the
dry
season
and
a
summer
crop
be
grown
upon
the
ground
they
cover
at
high
water
the
expediency
of
employing
them
and
the
mode
of
construction
depend
on
local
conditions
and
no
rules
of
universal
applicability
can
be
laid
down
on
the
subject
it
is
remarkable
that
nations
which
we
in
the
false
pride
of
our
modern
civilization

generally
regard
as
little
less
than
barbarian
should
have
long
preceded

employment
of

of

executed
immense
works
of
similar
description
both
in
the
great
arabian
peninsula
and
in
all
the
provinces
of
spain
which
had
the
good
fortune
to
fall
under
their
sway
the
spaniards
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
who
in
many
points
of
true
civilization
and
culture
were
far
inferior
to
the
races
they
subdued
wantonly
destroyed
these
noble
monuments
of
social
and
political
wisdom
or
suffered
them
to
perish
because
they
were
too
ignorant
to
appreciate
their
value
or
too
unskilful
as
practical
engineers
to
be
able
to
maintain
them
and
some
of
their
most
important
territories
were
soon
reduced
to
sterility
and
poverty

another
method
of
preventing
or
diminishing
the
evils
of
inundation
by
torrents
and
mountain
rivers
analogous
to
that
employed
for
the
drainage
of

consists
in
the
permanent
or
occasional
diversion
of
their
surplus
waters
or
of
their
entire
currents
from
their
natural
courses
by
tunnels
or
open
channels

through
their

nature
in
many
cases
resorts
to
a
similar
process
most
great
rivers
divide
themselves
into
several
arms
in
their
lower
course
and
enter
the
sea
by
different
mouths
there
are
also
cases
where
rivers
send
off
lateral
branches
to
convey
a
part
of
their
waters
into
the
channel
of
other
streams
the
most
remarkable
of
these
is
the
junction
between
the
amazon
and
the
orinoco
by
the
natural
canal
of
the
cassiquiare
and
the

are
similar

the
change
of
bed
in
rivers
by
gradual
erosion
of
their
banks
is
familiar
to
all
but
instances
of
the
sudden
abandonment
of
a
primitive
channel
are
by
no
means
wanting
at
a
period
of
unknown
antiquity
the
ardèche
pierced
a
tunnel
feet
wide
and
high
through
a
rock
and
sent
its
whole
current
through
it
deserting
its
former
bed
which
gradually
filled
up
though
its
course
remained
traceable
in
the
great
inundation
of
the
tunnel
proved
insufficient
for
the
discharge
of
the
water
and
the
river
burst
through
the
obstructions
which
had
now
choked
up
its
ancient
channel
and
resumed
its
original
course
it
was
probably
such
facts
as
these
that
suggested
to
ancient
engineers
the
possibility
of
like
artificial
operations
and
there
are
numerous
instances
of
the
execution
of
works
for
this
purpose
in
very
remote
ages
the
bahr
jusef
the
great
stream
which
supplies
the
fayoum
with
water
from
the
nile
has
been
supposed
by
some
writers
to
be
a
natural
channel
but
both
it
and
the
bahr
el
wady
are
almost
certainly
artificial
canals
constructed
to
water
that
basin
to
regulate
the
level
of
lake
moeris
and
possibly
also
to
diminish
the
dangers
resulting
from
excessive
inundations
of
the
nile
by
serving
as
to
discharge
a
part
of
its
surplus
waters
several
of
the
seven
ancient
mouths
of
the
nile
are
believed
to
be
artificial
channels
and
herodotus
even
asserts
that
king
menes
diverted
the
entire
course
of
that
river
from
the
libyan
to
the
arabian
side
of
the
valley
there
are
traces
of
an
ancient
river
bed
along
the
western
mountains
which
give
some
countenance
to
this
statement
but
it
is
much
more
probable
that
the
works
of
menes
were
designed
rather
to
prevent
a
natural
than
to
produce
an
artificial
change
in
the
channel
of
the
river
two
of
the
most
celebrated
cascades
in
europe
those
of
the
teverone
at
tivoli
and
of
the
velino
at
terni
owe
if
not
their
existence
at
least
their
position
and
character
to
the
diversion
of
their
waters
from
their
natural
beds
into
new
channels
in
order
to
obviate
the
evils
produced
by
their
frequent
floods
remarkable
works
of
the
same
sort
have
been
executed
in
switzerland
in
very
recent
times
until
the
year
the
kander
which
drains
several
large
alpine
valleys
ran
for
a
considerable
distance
parallel
with
the
lake
of
thun
and
a
few
miles
below
the
city
of
that
name
emptied
into
the
river
aar
it
frequently
flooded
the
flats
along
the
lower
part
of
its
course
and
it
was
determined
to
divert
it
into
the
lake
of
thun
for
this
purpose
two
parallel
tunnels
were
cut
through
the
intervening
rock
and
the
river
turned
into
them
the
violence
of
the
current
burst
up
the
roof
of
the
tunnels
and
in
a
very
short
time
wore
the
new
channel
down
not
less
than
one
hundred
feet
and
even
deepened
the
former
bed
at
least
fifty
feet
for
a
distance
of
two
or
three
miles
above
the
tunnel
the
lake
was
two
hundred
feet
deep
at
the
point
where
the
river
was
conducted
into
it
but
the
gravel
and
sand
carried
down
by
the
kander
has
formed
at
its
mouth
a
delta
containing
more
than
a
hundred
acres
which
is
still
advancing
at
the
rate
of
several
yards
a
year
the
linth
which
formerly
sent
its
waters
directly
to
the
lake
of
zurich
and
often
produced
very
destructive
inundations
was
turned
into
the
wallensee
about
forty
years
ago
and
in
both
these
cases
a
great
quantity
of
valuable
land
was
rescued
both
from
flood
and
from
insalubrity
in
switzerland
the
most
terrible
inundations
often
result
from
the
damming
up
of
deep
valleys
by
ice
slips
or
by
the
gradual
advance
of
glaciers
and
the
accumulation
of
great
masses
of
water
above
the
obstructions
the
ice
is
finally
dissolved
by
the
heat
of
summer
or
the
flow
of
warm
waters
and
when
it
bursts
the
lake
formed
above
is
discharged
almost
in
an
instant
and
all
below
is
swept
down
to
certain
destruction
in
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
lives
and
a
great
amount
of
property
were
lost
by
the
eruption
of
a
lake
formed
by
the
descent
of
a
glacier
into
the
valley
of
the
drance
and
a
similar
calamity
laid
waste
a
considerable
extent
of
soil
in
the
year
on
this
latter
occasion
the
barrier
of
ice
and
snow
was
feet
long
thick
and
high
and
the
lake
which
had
formed
above
it
contained
not
less
than
cubic
feet
a
tunnel
was
driven
through
the
ice
and
about
cubic
feet
of
water
safely
drawn
off
by
it
but
the
thawing
of
the
walls
of
the
tunnel
rapidly
enlarged
it
and
before
the
lake
was
half
drained
the
barrier
gave
way
and
the
remaining
cubic
feet
of
water
were
discharged
in
half
an
hour
the
recurrence
of
these
floods
has
since
been
prevented
by
directing
streams
of
water
warmed
by
the
sun
upon
the
ice
in
the
bed
of
the
valley
and
thus
thawing
it
before
it
accumulates
in
sufficient
mass
to
threaten
serious
danger
in
the
cases
of
diversion
of
streams
above
mentioned
important
geographical
changes
have
been
directly
produced
by
those
operations
by
the
rarer
process
of
draining
glacier
lakes
natural
eruptions
of
water
which
would
have
occasioned
not
less
important
changes
in
the
face
of
the
earth
have
been
prevented
by
human
agency
the
principal
means
hitherto
relied
upon
for
defence
against
river
inundations
has
been
the
construction
of
dikes
along
the
banks
of
the
streams
parallel
to
the
channel
and
generally
separated
from
each
other
by
a
distance
not
much
greater
than
the
natural
width
of
the
bed
if
such
walls
are
high
enough
to
confine
the
water
and
strong
enough
to
resist
its
pressure
they
secure
the
lands
behind
them
from
all
the
evils
of
inundation
except
those
resulting
from
infiltration
but
such
ramparts
are
enormously
costly
in
original
construction
and
maintenance
and
as
we
have
already
seen
the
filling
up
of
the
bed
of
the
river
in
its
lower
course
by
sand
and
gravel
involves
the
necessity
of
occasionally
incurring
new
expenditures
in
increasing
the
height
of
the
banks
they
are
attended
too
with
some
collateral
disadvantages
they
deprive
the
earth
of
the
fertilizing
deposits
of
the
waters
which
are
powerful
natural
restoratives
of
soils
exhausted
by
cultivation
they
accelerate
the
rapidity
and
transporting
power
of
the
current
at
high
water
by
confining
it
to
a
narrower
channel
and
it
consequently
conveys
to
the
sea
the
earthy
matter
it
holds
in
suspension
and
chokes
up
harbors
with
a
deposit
which
it
would
otherwise
have
spread
over
a
wide
surface
they
interfere
with
roads
and
the
convenience
of
river
navigation
and
no
amount
of
cost
or
care
can
secure
them
from
occasional
rupture
in
case
of
which
the
rush
of
the
waters
through
the
breach
is
more
destructive
than
the
natural
flow
of
the
highest
inundation
for
these
reasons
many
experienced
engineers
are
of
opinion
that
the
system
of
longitudinal
dikes
ought
to
be
abandoned
or
where
that
can
not
be
done
without
involving
too
great
a
sacrifice
of
existing
constructions
their
elevation
should
be
much
reduced
so
as
to
present
no
obstruction
to
the
lateral
spread
of
extraordinary
floods
and
they
should
be
provided
with
sluices
to
admit
the
water
without
violence
whenever
they
are
likely
to
be
overflowed
where
dikes
have
not
been
erected
and
where
they
have
been
reduced
in
height
it
is
proposed
to
construct
at
convenient
intervals
transverse
embankments
of
moderate
height
running
from
the
banks
of
the
river
across
the
plains
to
the
hills
which
bound
them
these
measures
it
is
argued
will
diminish
the
violence
of
inundations
by
permitting
the
waters
to
extend
themselves
over
a
greater
surface
and
thus
retarding
the
flow
of
the
river
currents
and
will
at
the
same
time
secure
the
deposit
of
fertilizing
slime
upon
all
the
soil
covered
by
the
flood
rozet
an
eminent
french
engineer
has
proposed
a
method
of
diminishing
the
ravages
of
inundations
which
aims
to
combine
the
advantages
of
all
other
systems
and
at
the
same
time
to
obviate
the
objections
to
which
they
are
all
more
or
less
liable
the
plan
of
rozet
is
recommended
by
its
simplicity
and
cheapness
as
well
as
its
facility
and
rapidity
of
execution
and
is
looked
upon
with
favor
by
many
persons
very
competent
to
judge
in
such
matters
he
proposes
to
commence
with
the
amphitheatres
in
which
mountain
torrents
so
often
rise
by
covering
their
slopes
and
filling
their
beds
with
loose
blocks
of
rock
and
by
constructing
at
their
outlets
and
at
other
narrow
points
in
the
channels
of
the
torrents
permeable
barriers
of
the
same
material
promiscuously
heaped
up
much
according
to
the
method
employed
by
the
ancient
romans
in
their
northern
provinces
for
a
similar
purpose
by
this
means
he
supposes
the
rapidity
of
the
current
would
be
checked
and
the
quantity
of
transported
pebbles
and
gravel
much
diminished
when
the
stream
has
reached
that
part
of
its
course
where
it
is
bordered
by
soil
capable
of
cultivation
and
worth
the
expense
of
protection
he
proposes
to
place
along
one
or
both
sides
of
the
stream
according
to
circumstances
a
line
of
cubical
blocks
of
stone
or
pillars
of
masonry
three
or
four
feet
high
and
wide
and
at
the
distance
of
about
eleven
yards
from
each
other
the
space
between
the
two
lines
or
between
a
line
and
the
opposite
high
bank
would
of
course
be
determined
by
observation
of
the
width
of
the
current
at
high
floods
as
an
auxiliary
measure
small
ditches
and
banks
or
low
walls
of
pebbles
should
be
constructed
from
the
line
of
blocks
across
the
grounds
to
be
protected
nearly
at
right
angles
to
the
current
but
slightly
inclining
downward
and
at
convenient
distances
from
each
other
rozet
thinks
the
proper
interval
would
be
yards
and
it
is
evident
that
if
he
is
right
in
his
main
principle
hedges
rows
of
trees
or
even
common
fences
would
in
many
cases
answer
as
good
a
purpose
as
banks
and
trenches
or
low
walls
the
blocks
or
pillars
of
stone
would
he
contends
check
the
lateral
currents
so
as
to
compel
them
to
let
fall
all
their
pebbles
and
gravel
in
the
main
channel
where
they
would
be
rolled
along
until
ground
down
to
sand
or
silt
and
the
transverse
obstructions
would
detain
the
water
upon
the
soil
long
enough
to
secure
the
deposit
of
its
fertilizing
slime
numerous
facts
are
cited
in
support
of
the
author
views
and
i
imagine
there
are
few
residents
of
rural
districts
whose
own
observation
will
not
furnish
testimony
confirmatory
of
their
soundness
the
deposit
of
slime
by
rivers
upon
the
flats
along
their
banks
not
only
contributes
greatly
to
the
fertility
of
the
soil
thus
flowed
but
it
subserves
a
still
more
important
purpose
in
the
general
economy
of
nature
all
running
streams
begin
with
excavating
channels
for
themselves
or
deepening
the
natural
depressions
in
which
they
flow
but
in
proportion
as
their
outlets
are
raised
by
the
solid
material
transported
by
their
currents
their
velocity
is
diminished
they
deposit
gravel
and
sand
at
constantly
higher
and
higher
points
and
so
at
last
elevate
in
the
middle
and
lower
part
of
their
course
the
beds
they
had
previously
scooped
out
the
raising
of
the
channels
is
compensated
in
part
by
the
simultaneous
elevation
of
their
banks
and
the
flats
adjoining
them
from
the
deposit
of
the
finer
particles
of
earth
and
vegetable
mould
brought
down
from
the
mountains
without
which
elevation
the
low
grounds
bordering
all
rivers
would
be
as
in
many
cases
they
in
fact
are
mere
morasses
all
arrangements
which
tend
to
obstruct
this
process
of
raising
the
flats
adjacent
to
the
channel
whether
consisting
in
dikes
which
confine
the
waters
and
at
the
same
time
augment
the
velocity
of
the
current
or
in
other
means
of
producing
the
effect
interfere
with
the
restorative
economy
of
nature
and
at
last
occasion
the
formation
of
marshes
where
if
left
to
herself
she
would
have
accumulated
inexhaustible
stores
of
the
richest
soil
and
spread
them
out
in
plains
above
the
reach
of
ordinary
floods
if
the
nile
had
been
if
a
system
of
continuous
lateral
dikes
like
those
of
the
po
had
been
adopted
in
egypt
in
the
early
dynasties
when
the
power
and
the
will
to
undertake
the
most
stupendous
material
enterprises
were
so
eminently
characteristic
of
the
government
of
that
country
and
the
waters
of
the
annual
inundation
consequently
prevented
from
flooding
the
land
it
is
conceivable
that
the
productiveness
of
the
small
area
of
cultivable
soil
in
the
nile
valley
might
have
been
long
kept
up
by
artificial
irrigation
and
the
application
of
manures
but
nature
would
have
rebelled
at
last
and
centuries
before
our
time
the
mighty
river
would
have
burst
the
fetters
by
which
impotent
man
had
vainly
striven
to
bind
his
swelling
floods
the
fertile
fields
of
egypt
would
have
been
converted
into
dank
morasses
and
then
perhaps
in
some
distant
future
when
the
expulsion
of
man
should
have
allowed
the
gradual
restoration
of
the
primitive
equilibrium
would
be
again
transformed
into
luxuriant
garden
and
plough
land
fortunately
the
wisdom
of
egypt
taught
her
children
better
things
they
invited
and
welcomed
not
repulsed
the
slimy
embraces
of
nilus
and
his
favors
have
been
from
the
hoariest
antiquity
the
greatest
material
blessing
ever
bestowed
upon
a
people
the
valley
of
the
po
has
probably
not
been
cultivated
or
inhabited
so
long
as
that
of
the
nile
but
embankments
have
been
employed
on
its
lower
course
for
at
least
two
thousand
years
and
for
many
centuries
they
have
been
connected
in
a
continuous
chain
i
have
pointed
out
in
a
former
chapter
the
effects
produced
on
the
geography
of
the
adriatic
by
the
deposit
of
river
sediment
in
the
sea
at
the
mouths
of
the
po
the

and

brenta

these
rivers
had
been
left

the
nile
and
allowed
to
spread
their
muddy
waters
at
will
according
to
the
laws
of
nature
the
slime
they
have
carried
to
the
coast
would
have
been
chiefly
distributed
over
the
plains
of
lombardy
their
banks
would
have
risen
as
fast
as
their
beds
the
coast
line
would
not
have
been
extended
so
far
into
the
adriatic
and
the
current
of
the
streams
being
consequently
shorter
the
inclination
of
their
channel
and
the
rapidity
of
their
flow
would
not
have
been
so
greatly
diminished
had
man
spared
a
reasonable
proportion
of
the
forests
of
the
alps
and
not
attempted
to
control
the
natural
drainage
of
the
surface
the
po
would
resemble
the
nile
in
all
its
essential
characteristics
and
in
spite
of
the
difference
of
climate
perhaps
be
regarded
as
the
friend
and
ally
not
the
enemy
and
the
invader
of
the
population
which
dwells
upon
its
banks
the
nile
is
larger
than
all
the
rivers
of
lombardy
together
it
drains
a
basin
twenty
times
as
extensive
its
banks
have
been
occupied
by
man
probably
twice
as
long
but
its
geographical
character
has
not
been
much
changed
in
the
whole
period
of
recorded
history
and
though
its
outlets
have
somewhat
fluctuated
in
number
and
position
its
historically
known
encroachments
upon
the
sea
are
trifling
compared
with
those
of
the
po
and
the
neighboring
streams
the
deposits
of
the
nile
are
naturally
greater
in
upper
than
in
lower
egypt
they
are
found
to
have
raised
the
soil
at
thebes
about
seven
feet
within
the
last
seventeen
hundred
years
and
in
the
delta
the
rise
has
been
certainly
more
than
half
as
great
we
shall
therefore
not
exceed
the
truth
if
we
suppose
the
annually
inundated
surface
of
egypt
to
have
been
elevated
upon
an
average
ten
feet
within
the
last
years
or
twice
and
a
half
the
period
during
which
the
history
of
the
po
is
known
to
us
we
may
estimate
the
present
actually
cultivated
area
of
egypt
at
about
square
statute
miles
as
i
have
computed
in
a
note
on
page
that
area
is
not
more
than
half
as
extensive
as
under
the
dynasties
of
the
pharaohs
and
the
ptolemies
for
though
in
consequence
of
the
elevation
of
the
river
bed
the
inundations
now
have
a
wider
spread
the
industry
of
the
ancient
egyptians
conducted
the
nile
water
over
a
great
extent
of
soil
it
does
not
now
reach
we
may
then
adopt
a
mean
between
the
two
quantities
and
we
shall
probably
come
near
the
truth
if
we
assume
the
convenient
number
of
square
statute
miles
as
the
average
measure
of
the
inundated
land
during
the
historical
period
taking
the
deposit
on
this
surface
at
ten
feet
the
river
sediment
let
fall
on
the
soil
of
egypt
within
the
last
fifty
centuries
would
amount
to
fifteen
cubic
miles
had
the
nile
been
banked
in
like
the
po
all
this
deposit
except
that
contained
in
the
water
diverted
by
canals
or
otherwise
drawn
from
the
river
for
irrigation
and
other
purposes
would
have
been
carried
out
to
sea
this
would
have
been
a
considerable
quantity
for
the
nile
holds
earth
in
suspension
even
at
low
water
a
much
larger
proportion
during
the
flood
and
irrigation
must
have
been
carried
on
during
the
whole
year
the
precise
amount
which
would
have
been
thus
distributed
over
the
soil
is
matter
of
conjecture
but
three
cubic
miles
is
certainly
a
liberal
estimate
this
would
leave
twelve
cubic
miles
as
the
quantity
which
embankments
would
have
compelled
the
nile
to
transport
to
the
mediterranean
over
and
above
what
it
has
actually
deposited
in
that
sea
the
mediterranean
is
shoal
for
some
miles
out
to
sea
along
the
whole
coast
of
the
delta
and
the
large
bays
or
lagoons
within
the
coast
line
which
communicate
both
with
the
river
and
the
sea
have
little
depth
of
water
these
lagoons
the
river
deposits
would
have
filled
up
and
there
would
still
have
been
surplus
earth
enough
to
extend
the
delta
far
into
the
mediterranean
of
the
tuscan
the
arno
and
all
the
rivers
rising
on
the
western
slopes
and
spurs
of
the
apennines
carry
down
immense
quantities
of
mud
to
the
mediterranean
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
volume
of
earth
so
transported
is
very
much
greater
than
it
would
have
been
had
the
soil
about
the
headwaters
of
those
rivers
continued
to
be
protected
from
wash
by
forests
and
there
is
as
little
question
that
the
quantity
borne
out
to
sea
by
the
rivers
of
western
italy
is
much
increased
by
artificial
embankments
because
they
are
thereby
prevented
from
spreading
over
the
surface
the
sedimentary
matter
with
which
they
are
charged
the
western
coast
of
tuscany
has
advanced
some
miles
seaward
within
a
very
few
centuries
the
bed
of
the
sea
for
a
long
distance
has
been
raised
and
of
course
the
relative
elevation
of
the
land
above
it
lessened
harbors
have
been
filled
up
and
destroyed
long
lines
of
coast
dunes
have
been
formed
and
the
diminished
inclination
of
the
beds
of
the
rivers
near
their
outlets
has
caused
their
waters
to
overflow
their
banks
and
convert
them
into
pestilential
marshes
the
territorial
extent
of
western
italy
has
thus
been
considerably
increased
but
the
amount
of
soil
habitable
and
cultivable
by
man
has
been
in
a
still
higher
proportion
diminished
the
coast
of
ancient
etruria
was
filled
with
great
commercial
towns
and
their
rural
environs
were
occupied
by
a
large
and
prosperous
population
but
maritime
tuscany
has
long
been
one
of
the
most
unhealthy
districts
in
christendom
the
famous
mart
of
populonia
has
not
an
inhabitant
the
coast
is
almost
absolutely
depopulated
and
the
malarious
fevers
have
extended
their
ravages
far
into
the
interior
these
results
are
certainly
not
to
be
ascribed
wholly
to
human
action
they
are
in
a
large
proportion
due
to
geological
causes
over
which
man
has
no
control
the
soil
of
much
of
tuscany
becomes
pasty
almost
fluid
even
as
soon
as
it
is
moistened
and
when
thoroughly
saturated
with
water
it
flows
like
a
river
such
a
soil
as
this
would
not
be
completely
protected
by
woods
and
indeed
it
would
now
be
difficult
to
confine
it
long
enough
to
allow
it
to
cover
itself
with
forest
vegetation
nevertheless
it
certainly
was
once
chiefly
wooded
and
the
rivers
which
flow
through
it
must
then
have
been
much
less
charged
with
earthy
matter
than
at
present
and
they
must
have
carried
into
the
sea
a
smaller
proportion
of
their
sediment
when
they
were
free
to
deposit
it
on
their
banks
than
since
they
have
been
confined
by
dikes
it
is
in
general
true
that
the
intervention
of
man
has
hitherto
seemed
to
insure
the
final
exhaustion
ruin
and
desolation
of
every
province
of
nature
which
he
has
reduced
to
his
dominion
attila
was
only
giving
an
energetic
and
picturesque
expression
to
the
tendencies
of
human
action
as
personified
in
himself
when
he
said
that
no
grass
grew
where
his
horse
hoofs
had
trod
the
instances
are
few
where
a
second
civilization
has
flourished
upon
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
culture
and
lands
once
rendered
uninhabitable
by
human
acts
or
neglect
have
generally
been
forever
abandoned
as
hopelessly
irreclaimable
it
is
as
i
have
before
remarked
a
question
of
vast
importance
how
far
it
is
practicable
to
restore
the
garden
we
have
wasted
and
it
is
a
problem
on
which
experience
throws
little
light
because
few
deliberate
attempts
have
yet
been
made
at
the
work
of
physical
regeneration
on
a
scale
large
enough
to
warrant
general
conclusions
in
any
one
class
of
cases
the
valleys
and
shores
of
tuscany
form
however
a
striking
exception
to
this
remark
the
success
with
which
human
guidance
has
made
the
operations
of
nature
herself
available
for
the
restoration
of
her
disturbed
harmonies
in
the
val
di
chiana
and
the
tuscan
maremma
is
among
the
noblest
if
not
the
most
brilliant
achievements
of
modern
engineering
and
regarded
in
all
its
bearings
on
the
great
question
of
which
i
have
just
spoken
it
is
as
an
example
of
more
importance
to
the
general
interests
of
humanity
than
the
proudest
work
of
internal
improvement
that
mechanical
means
have
yet
constructed
the
operations
in
the
val
di
chiana
have
consisted
chiefly
in
so
regulating
the
flow
of
the
surface
waters
into
and
through
it
as
to
compel
them
to
deposit
their
sedimentary
matter
at
the
will
of
the
engineers
and
thereby
to
raise
grounds
rendered
insalubrious
and
unfit
for
agricultural
use
by
stagnating
water
the
improvements
in
the
maremma
have
embraced
both
this
method
of
elevating
the
level
of
the
soil
and
the
prevention
of
the
mixture
of
salt
water
with
fresh
in
the
coast
marshes
and
shallow
bays
which
is
a
very
active
cause
of
the
development
of
malarious
influences
in
the
val
di
for
twenty
miles
or
more
after
the
remotest
headwaters
of
the
arno
have
united
to
form
a
considerable
stream
this
river
flows
southeastward
to
the
vicinity
of
arezzo
it
here
sweeps
round
to
the
northwest
and
follows
that
course
to
near
its
junction
with
the
sieve
a
few
miles
above
florence
from
which
point
its
general
direction
is
westward
to
the
sea
from
the
bend
at
arezzo
a
depression
called
the
val
di
chiana
runs
southeastward
until
it
strikes
into
the
valley
of
the
paglia
a
tributary
of
the
tiber
and
thus
connects
the
basin
of
the
latter
river
with
that
of
the
arno
in
the
middle
ages
and
down
to
the
eighteenth
century
the
val
di
chiana
was
often
overflowed
and
devastated
by
the
torrents
which
poured
down
from
the
highlands
transporting
great
quantities
of
slime
with
their
currents
stagnating
upon
its
surface
and
gradually
converting
it
into
a
marshy
and
unhealthy
district
which
was
at
last
very
greatly
reduced
in
population
and
productiveness
it
had
in
fact
become
so
desolate
that
even
the
swallow
had
deserted
it
the
bed
of
the
arno
near
arezzo
and
that
of
the
paglia
at
the
southern
extremity
of
the
val
di
chiana
did
not
differ
much
in
level
the
general
inclination
of
the
valley
was
therefore
small
it
does
not
appear
to
have
ever
been
divided
into
opposite
slopes
by
a
true
watershed
and
the
position
of
the
summit
seems
to
have
shifted
according
to
the
varying
amount
and
place
of
deposit
of
the
sediment
brought
down
by
the
lateral
streams
which
emptied
into
it
the
length
of
its
principal
channel
of
drainage
and
even
the
direction
of
its
flow
at
any
given
point
were
therefore
fluctuating
hence
much
difference
of
opinion
was
entertained
at
different
times
with
regard
to
the
normal
course
of
this
stream
and
consequently
to
the
question
whether
it
was
to
be
regarded
as
properly
an
affluent
of
the
tiber
or
of
the
arno
the
bed
of
the
latter
river
at
the
bend
has
been
eroded
to
the
depth
of
thirty
or
forty
feet
and
that
apparently
at
no
very
remote
period
if
it
were
elevated
to
what
was
evidently
its
original
height
the
current
of
the
arno
would
be
so
much
above
that
of
the
paglia
as
to
allow
of
a
regular
flow
from
its
channel
to
the
latter
stream
through
the
val
di
chiana
provided
the
bed
of
the
valley
had
remained
at
the
level
which
excavations
prove
it
to
have
had
a
few
centuries
ago
before
it
was
raised
by
the
deposits
i
have
mentioned
these
facts
together
with
the
testimony
of
ancient
geographers
which
scarcely
admits
of
any
other
explanation
are
thought
to
prove
that
all
the
waters
of
the
upper
arno
were
originally
discharged
through
the
val
di
chiana
into
the
tiber
and
that
a
part
of
them
still
continued
to
flow
at
least
occasionally
in
that
direction
down
to
the
days
of
the
roman
empire
and
perhaps
for
some
time
later
the
depression
of
the
bed
of
the
arno
and
the
raising
of
that
of
the
valley
by
the
deposits
of
the
lateral
torrents
and
of
the
arno
itself
finally
cut
off
the
branch
of
the
river
which
had
flowed
to
the
tiber
and
all
its
waters
were
turned
into
its
present
channel
though
the
principal
drainage
of
the
val
di
chiana
appears
to
have
been
in
a
southeastwardly
direction
until
within
a
comparatively
recent
period
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
elevation
of
the
bed
of
the
valley
had
become
so
considerable
that
in
at
a
point
about
ten
miles
south
of
the
arno
it
was
found
to
be
not
less
than
one
hundred
and
thirty
feet
above
that
river
then
followed
a
level
of
ten
miles
and
then
a
continuous
descent
to
the
paglia
along
the
level
portion
of
the
valley
was
a
boatable
channel
and
lakes
sometimes
a
mile
or
even
two
miles
in
breadth
had
formed
at
various
points
farther
south
at
this
period
the
drainage
of
the
summit
level
might
easily
have
been
determined
in
either
direction
and
the
opposite
descents
of
the
valley
made
to
culminate
at
the
north
or
at
the
south
end
of
the
level
in
the
former
case
the
watershed
would
have
been
ten
miles
south
of
the
arno
in
the
latter
twenty
miles
and
the
division
would
have
been
not
very
unequal
various
schemes
were
suggested
at
this
time
for
drawing
off
the
stagnant
waters
as
well
as
for
the
future
regular
drainage
of
the
valley
and
small
operations
for
those
purposes
were
undertaken
with
partial
success
but
it
was
feared
that
the
discharge
of
the
accumulated
waters
into
the
tiber
would
produce
a
dangerous
inundation
while
the
diversion
of
the
drainage
into
the
arno
would
increase
the
violence
of
the
floods
to
which
that
river
was
very
subject
and
no
decisive
steps
were
taken
in
an
engineer
whose
name
has
not
been
preserved
proposed
as
the
only
possible
method
of
improvement
the
piercing
of
a
tunnel
through
the
hills
bounding
the
valley
on
the
west
to
convey
its
waters
to
the
ombrone
but
the
expense
and
other
objections
prevented
the
adoption
of
this
project
the
fears
of
the
roman
government
for
the
security
of
the
valley
of
the
tiber
had
induced
it
to
construct
barriers
across
that
part
of
the
channel
which
lay
within
its
territory
and
these
obstructions
though
not
specifically
intended
for
that
purpose
naturally
promoted
the
deposit
of
sediment
and
the
elevation
of
the
bed
of
the
valley
in
their
neighborhood
the
effect
of
this
measure
and
of
the
continued
spontaneous
action
of
the
torrents
was
that
the
northern
slope
which
in
had
commenced
at
the
distance
of
ten
miles
from
the
arno
was
found
in
to
begin
nearly
thirty
miles
south
of
that
river
and
in
it
had
been
removed
about
six
miles
farther
in
the
same
direction
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
tuscan
and
papal
governments
consulted
galileo
torricelli
castelli
cassini
viviani
and
other
distinguished
philosophers
and
engineers
on
the
possibility
of
reclaiming
the
valley
by
a
regular
artificial
drainage
most
of
these
eminent
physicists
were
of
opinion
that
the
measure
was
impracticable
though
not
altogether
for
the
same
reasons
but
they
seem
to
have
agreed
in
thinking
that
the
opening
of
such
channels
in
either
direction
as
would
give
the
current
a
flow
sufficiently
rapid
to
drain
the
lands
properly
would
dangerously
augment
the
inundations
of
the
river
whether
the
tiber
or
the
arno
into
which
the
waters
should
be
turned
the
general
improvement
of
the
valley
was
now
for
a
long
time
abandoned
and
the
waters
were
allowed
to
spread
and
stagnate
until
carried
off
by
partial
drainage
infiltration
and
evaporation
torricelli
had
contended
that
the
slope
of
a
large
part
of
the
valley
was
too
small
to
allow
it
to
be
drained
by
ordinary
methods
and
that
no
practicable
depth
and
width
of
canal
would
suffice
for
that
purpose
it
could
be
laid
dry
he
thought
only
by
converting
its
surface
into
an
inclined
plane
and
he
suggested
that
this
might
be
accomplished
by
controlling
the
flow
of
the
numerous
torrents
which
pour
into
it
so
as
to
force
them
to
deposit
their
sediment
at
the
pleasure
of
the
engineer
and
consequently
to
elevate
the
level
of
the
area
over
which
it
should
be
spread
this
plan
did
not
meet
with
immediate
general
acceptance
but
it
was
soon
adopted
for
local
purposes
at
some
points
in
the
southern
part
of
the
valley
and
it
gradually
grew
in
public
favor
and
was
extended
in
application
until
its
final
triumph
a
hundred
years
later
in
spite
of
these
encouraging
successes
however
the
fear
of
danger
to
the
valley
of
the
arno
and
the
tiber
and
the
difficulty
of
an
agreement
between
tuscany
and
rome
the
boundary
between
which
states
crossed
the
val
di
chiana
not
far
from
the
halfway
point
between
the
two
rivers
and
of
reconciling
other
conflicting
interests
prevented
the
resumption
of
the
projects
for
the
general
drainage
of
the
valley
until
after
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
the
mean
time
the
science
of
hydraulics
had
become
better
understood
and
the
establishment
of
the
natural
law
according
to
which
the
velocity
of
a
current
of
water
and
of
course
the
proportional
quantity
discharged
by
it
in
a
given
time
are
increased
by
increasing
its
mass
had
diminished
if
not
dissipated
the
fear
of
exposing
the
banks
of
the
arno
to
greater
danger
from
inundations
by
draining
the
val
di
chiana
into
it
the
suggestion
of
torricelli
was
finally
adopted
as
the
basis
of
a
comprehensive
system
of
improvement
and
it
was
decided
to
continue
and
extend
the
inversion
of
the
original
flow
of
the
waters
and
to
turn
them
into
the
arno
from
a
point
as
far
to
the
south
as
should
be
found
practicable
the
conduct
of
the
works
was
committed
to
a
succession
of
able
engineers
who
for
a
long
series
of
years
were
under
the
general
direction
of
the
celebrated
philosopher
and
statesman
fossombroni
and
the
success
has
fully
justified
the
expectations
of
the
most
sanguine
advocates
of
the
scheme
the
plan
of
improvement
embraced
two
branches
the
one
the
removal
of
certain
obstructions
in
the
bed
of
the
arno
and
consequently
the
further
depression
of
the
channel
of
that
river
in
certain
places
with
the
view
of
increasing
the
rapidity
of
its
current
the
other
the
gradual
filling
up
of
the
ponds
and
swamps
and
raising
of
the
lower
grounds
of
the
val
di
chiana
by
directing
to
convenient
points
the
flow
of
the
streams
which
pour
down
into
it
and
there
confining
their
waters
by
temporary
dams
until
the
sediment
was
deposited
where
it
was
needed
the
economical
result
of
these
operations
has
been
that
in
an
area
of
more
than
four
hundred
and
fifty
square
miles
of
pond
marsh
and
damp
sickly
low
grounds
had
been
converted
into
fertile
healthy
and
soil
and
consequently
that
so
much
territory
has
been
added
to
the
agricultural
domain
of
tuscany
but
in
our
present
view
of
the
subject
the
geographical
revolution
which
has
been
accomplished
is
still
more
interesting
the
climatic
influence
of
the
elevation
and
draining
of
the
soil
must
have
been
considerable
though
i
do
not
know
that
an
increase
or
a
diminution
of
the
mean
temperature
or
precipitation
in
the
valley
has
been
established
by
meteorological
observation
there
is
however
in
the
improvement
of
the
sanitary
condition
of
the
val
di
chiana
which
was
formerly
extremely
unhealthy
satisfactory
proof
of
a
beneficial
climatic
change
the
fevers
which
not
only
decimated
the
population
of
the
low
grounds
but
infested
the
adjacent
hills
have
ceased
their
ravages
and
are
now
not
more
frequent
than
in
other
parts
of
tuscany
the
strictly
topographical
effect
of
the
operations
in
question
besides
the
conversion
of
marsh
into
dry
surface
has
been
the
inversion
of
the
inclination
of
the
valley
for
a
distance
of
miles
so
that
this
great
plain
which
within
a
comparatively
short
period
sloped
and
drained
its
waters
to
the
south
now
inclines
and
sends
its
drainage
to
the
north
the
reversal
of
the
currents
of
the
valley
has
added
to
the
arno
a
new
tributary
equal
to
the
largest
of
its
former
affluents
and
a
most
important
circumstance
connected
with
this
latter
fact
is
that
the
increase
of
the
volume
of
its
waters
has
accelerated
their
velocity
in
a
still
greater
proportion
and
instead
of
augmenting
the
danger
from
its
inundations
has
almost
wholly
obviated
that
source
of
apprehension
between
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
and
the
year
destructive
floods
of
the
arno
are
recorded
between

the
principal
streams
of

more
formidable

encountered
the
territory
to
be
reclaimed
was
more
extensive
the
salubrious
places
of
retreat
for
laborers
and
inspectors
were
more
remote
the
courses
of
the
rivers
to
be
controlled
were
longer
and
their
natural
inclination
less
rapid

comparatively

above

a

junction
of
its
two
branches
is
narrower
though
swifter
than
either
of

and
such
cases
are
by
no
means
unfrequent
the
immediate
effect
of
the
confluence
of
two
rivers
upon
the
current
below
depends
upon
local
circumstances
and
especially
upon
the
angle
of
incidence
if
the
two
nearly
coincide
in
direction
so
as
to
include
a
small
angle
the
joint
current
will
have
a
greater
velocity
than
the
slower
confluent
perhaps
even
than
either
of
them
if
the
two
rivers
run
in
transverse
still
more
if
they
flow
in
more
or
less
opposite
directions
the
velocity
of
the
principal
branch
will
be
retarded
both
above
and
below
the
junction
and
at
high
water
it
may
even
set
back
the
current
of

the
other
hand
the
diversion
of
a
considerable
branch
from
a
river
retards
its
velocity
below
the
point
of
separation
and
here
a
deposit
of
earth
in
its
channel
immediately
begins
which
has
a
tendency
to
turn
the
whole
stream
into
the
new

and
the
authority
of

i
have
spoken
with
some
detail
of
the
improvements
in
the
val
di
chiana
and
the
tuscan
maremma
because
of
their
great
relative
importance
and
because
their
history
is
well
known
but
like
operations
have
been
executed
in
the
territory
of
pisa
and
upon
the
coast
of
the
duchy
of
lucca
in
the
latter
case
they
were
confined
principally
to
prevention
of
the
intermixing
of
fresh
water
with
that
of
the
sea
in
sluices
or
lock
gates
were
constructed
for
this
purpose
and
the
following
year
the
fevers
which
had
been
destructive
to
the
coast
population
for
a
long
time
previous
disappeared
altogether
in
and
the
works
having
fallen
to
decay
the
fevers
returned
in
a
very
malignant
form
but
the
rebuilding
of
the
gates
again
restored
the
healthfulness
of
the
shore
similar
facts
recurred
in
and
and
again
from
to
this
long
and
repeated
experience
has
at
last
impressed
upon
the
people
the
necessity
of
vigilant
attention
to
the
sluices
which
are
now
kept
in
constant
repair
the
health
of
the
coast
is
uninterrupted
and
viareggio
the
capital
town
of
the
district
is
now
much
frequented
for
its
sea
baths
and
its
general
salubrity
at
a
season
when
formerly
it
was
justly
shunned
as
the
abode
of
disease
and
death
it
is
now
a
hundred
years
since
the
commencement
of
the
improvements
in
the
val
di
chiana
and
those
of
the
maremma
have
been
in
more
or
less
continued
operation
for
above
a
generation
they
have
as
we
have
seen
produced
important
geographical
changes
in
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
in
the
flow
of
considerable
rivers
and
their
effects
have
been
not
less
conspicuous
in
preventing
other
changes
of
a
deleterious
character
which
would
infallibly
have
taken
place
if
they
had
not
been
arrested
by
the
improvements
in
question
it
has
been
already
stated
that
in
order
to
prevent
the
overflow
of
the
valley
of
the
tiber
by
freely
draining
the
val
di
chiana
into
it
the
papal
authorities
long
before
the
commencement
of
the
tuscan
works
constructed
strong
barriers
near
the
southern
end
of
the
valley
which
detained
the
waters
of
the
wet
season
until
they
could
be
gradually
drawn
off
into
the
paglia
they
consequently
deposited
most
of
their
sediment
in
the
val
di
chiana
and
carried
down
comparatively
little
earth
to
the
tiber
the
lateral
streams
contributing
the
largest
quantities
of
sedimentary
matter
to
the
val
di
chiana
originally
flowed
into
that
valley
near
its
northern
end
and
the
change
of
their
channels
and
outlets
in
a
southern
direction
so
as
to
raise
that
part
of
the
valley
by
their
deposits
and
thereby
reverse
its
drainage
was
one
of
the
principal
steps
in
the
process
of
improvement
we
have
seen
that
the
north
end
of
the
val
di
chiana
near
the
arno
had
been
raised
by
spontaneous
deposit
of
sediment
to
such
a
height
as
to
interpose
a
sufficient
obstacle
to
all
flow
in
that
direction
if
then
the
roman
dam
had
not
been
erected
or
the
works
of
the
tuscan
government
undertaken
the
whole
of
the
earth
which
has
been
arrested
by
those
works
and
employed
to
raise
the
bed
and
reverse
the
declivity
of
the
valley
would
have
been
carried
down
to
the
tiber
and
thence
into
the
sea
the
deposit
thus
created
would
of
course
have
contributed
to
increase
the
advance
of
the
shore
at
the
mouth
of
that
river
which
has
long
been
going
on
at
the
rate
of
three
mètres
and
nine
tenths
twelve
feet
and
nine
inches
per
annum
it
is
evident
that
a
quantity
of
earth
sufficient
to
effect
the
immense
changes
i
have
described
in
a
wide
valley
more
than
thirty
miles
long
if
deposited
at
the
outlet
of
the
tiber
would
have
very
considerably
modified
the
outline
of
the
coast
and
have
exerted
no
unimportant
influence
on
the
flow
of
that
river
by
raising
its
point
of
discharge
and
lengthening
its
channel
the
sediment
washed
into
the
marshes
of
the
maremme
is
not
less
than
cubic
yards
per
annum
the
escape
of
this
quantity
into
the
sea
which
is
now
almost
wholly
prevented
would
be
sufficient
to
advance
the
coast
line
fourteen
yards
per
year
for
a
distance
of
forty
miles
computing
the
mean
depth
of
the
sea
near
the
shore
at
twelve
yards
it
is
true
that
in
this
case
as
well
as
in
that
of
other
rivers
the
sedimentary
matter
would
not
be
distributed
equally
along
the
shore
and
much
of
it
would
be
carried
out
into
deep
water
or
perhaps
transported
by
the
currents
to
distant
coasts
the
immediate
effects
of
the
deposit
therefore
would
not
be
so

at

at

nothing

enables
a

in

degree
the

to
carry

out
into

to
prevent
the
formation
of

the
degradation
of
their

and
the
transportation
of
earthy
matter
to
the

by
their

are
gradually
filling
up
the

of

the

not
in

to
resist
by
any
means
at

available
but
as
we
have
seen
something
can
be
done
to
prevent
the
degradation
of

and
to
diminish
the

of

annually
abstracted
from

hence
if

its

flows
over

the
progress
of
the
emphatically
modern
science
of
geology
has
corrected
these
erroneous
views
because
the
observations
on
which
it
depends
have
demonstrated
not
only
the
existence
but
the
movement
of
water
in
nearly
all
geological
formations
have
collected
evidence
of
the
presence
of
large
reservoirs
at
greater
or
less
depths
beneath
surfaces
of
almost
every
character
and
have
investigated
the
rationale
of
the
attendant
phenomena
the
distribution
of
these
waters
has
been
minutely
studied
with
reference
to
a
great
number
of
localities
and
though
the
actual
mode
of
their
vertical
and
horizontal
transmission
is
still
involved
in
much
doubt
the
laws
which
determine
their
aggregation
are
so
well
understood
that
when
the
geology
of
a
given
district
is
known
it
is
not
difficult
to
determine
at
what
depth
water
will
be
reached
by
the
borer
and
to
what
height
it
will
rise
the
same
principles
have
been
successfully
applied
to
the
discovery
of
small
subterranean
collections
or
currents
of
water
and
some
persons
have
acquired
by
a
moderate
knowledge
of
the
superficial
structure
of
the
earth
combined
with
long
practice
a
skill
in
the
selection
of
favorable
places
for
digging
wells
which
seems
to
common
observers
little
less
than
miraculous
the
abbé
paramelle
a
french
ecclesiastic
who
devoted
himself
for
some
years
to
this
subject
and
was
extensively
employed
as
a
states
in
his
work
on
fountains
that
in
the
course
of
years
he
had
pointed
out
more
than
ten
thousand
subterranean
springs
and
though
his
geological
speculations
were
often
erroneous
the
highest
scientific
authorities
in
europe
have
testified
to
the
great
practical
value
of
his
methods
and
the
almost
infallible
certainty
of
his
predictions
babinet
quotes
a
french
proverb
summer
rain
wets
nothing
and
explains
it
as
meaning
that
the
water
of
such
rains
is
almost
totally
taken
up
by
evaporation
the
rains
of
summer
he
adds
however
abundant
they
may
be
do
not
penetrate
the
soil
to
a
greater
depth
than
or
centimètres
in
summer
the
evaporating
power
of
the
heat
is
five
or
six
times
as
great
as
in
winter
and
this
power
is
exerted
by
an
atmosphere
capable
of
containing
five
times
as
much
vapor
as
in
winter
a
stratum
of
snow
which
prevents
evaporation
from
the
soil
causes
almost
all
the
water
that
composes
it
to
filter
down
into
the
earth
and
form
a
reserve
for
springs
wells
and
rivers
which
could
not
be
supplied
by
any
amount
of
summer
rain
this
latter
useful
indeed
like
dew
to
vegetation
does
not
penetrate
the
soil
and
accumulate
a
store
to
feed
springs
and
to
be
brought
up
by
them
to
the
open
air
this
conclusion
however
applicable
it
may
be
to
the
climate
and
soil
of
france
is
too
broadly
stated
to
be
accepted
as
a
general
truth
and
in
countries
where
the
precipitation
is
small
in
the
winter
months
familiar
observation
shows
that
the
quantity
of
water
yielded
by
deep
wells
and
natural
springs
depends
not
less
on
the
rains
of
summer
than
on
those
of
the
rest
of
the
year
and
consequently
that
much
of
the
precipitation
of
that
season
must
find
its
way
to
strata
too
deep
to
lose
water
by
evaporation
the
supply
of
subterranean
reservoirs
and
currents
as
well
as
of
springs
is
undoubtedly
derived
chiefly
from
infiltration
and
hence
it
must
be
affected
by
all
changes
of
the
natural
surface
that
accelerate
or
retard
the
drainage
of
the
soil
or
that
either
promote
or
obstruct
evaporation
from
it
it
has
sufficiently
appeared
from
what
has
gone
before
that
the
spontaneous
drainage
of
cleared
ground
is
more
rapid
than
that
of
the
forest
and
consequently
that
the
felling
of
the
woods
as
well
as
the
draining
of
swamps
deprives
the
subterranean
waters
of
accessions
which
would
otherwise
be
conveyed
to
them
by
infiltration
the
same
effect
is
produced
by
artificial
contrivances
for
drying
the
soil
either
by
open
ditches
or
by
underground
pipes
or
channels
and
in
proportion
as
the
sphere
of
these
operations
is
extended
the
effect
of
them
can
not
fail
to
make
itself
more
and
more
sensibly
felt
in
the
diminished
supply
of
water
furnished
by
wells
and
running
springs
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
loose
soils
stripped
of
vegetation
and
broken
up
by
the
plough
or
other
processes
of
cultivation
may
until
again
carpeted
by
grasses
or
other
plants
absorb
more
rain
and
snow
water
than
when
they
were
covered
by
a
natural
growth
but
it
is
also
true
that
the
evaporation
from
such
soils
is
augmented
in
a
still
greater
proportion
rain
scarcely
penetrates
beneath
the
sod
of
grass
ground
but
runs
off
over
the
surface
and
after
the
heaviest
showers
a
ploughed
field
will
often
be
dried
by
evaporation
before
the
water
can
be
carried
off
by
infiltration
while
the
soil
of
a
neighboring
grove
will
remain
half
saturated
for
weeks
together
sandy
soils
frequently
rest
on
a
tenacious
subsoil
at
a
moderate
depth
as
is
usually
seen
in
the
pine
plains
of
the
united
states
where
pools
of
rain
water
collect
in
slight
depressions
on
the
surface
of
earth
the
upper
stratum
of
which
is
as
porous
as
a
sponge
in
the
open
grounds
such
pools
are
very
soon
dried
up
by
the
sun
and
wind
in
the
woods
they
remain
unevaporated
long
enough
for
the
water
to
diffuse
itself
laterally
until
it
finds
in
the
subsoil
crevices
through
which
it
may
escape
or
slopes
which
it
may
follow
to
their
outcrop
or
descend
along
them
to
lower
strata
the
readiness
with
which
water
not
obstructed
by
impermeable
strata
diffuses
itself
through
the
earth
in
all
directions
and
consequently
the
importance
of
keeping
up
the
supply
of
subterranean
reservoirs
find
a
familiar
illustration
in
the
effect
of
paving
the
ground
about
the
stems
of
vines
and
trees
the
surface
earth
around
the
trunk
of
a
tree
may
be
made
perfectly
impervious
to
water
by
flag
stones
and
cement
for
a
distance
greater
than
the
spread
of
the
roots
and
yet
the
tree
will
not
suffer
for
want
of
moisture
except
in
droughts
severe
enough
sensibly
to
affect
the
supply
in
deep
wells
and
springs
both
forest
and
fruit
trees
grow
well
in
cities
where
the
streets
and
courts
are
closely
paved
and
where
even
the
lateral
access
of
water
to
the
roots
is
more
or
less
obstructed
by
deep
cellars
and
foundation
walls
the
veins
and
sheets
of
water
supplied
by
infiltration
from
above
send
up
moisture
by
capillary
attraction
and
the
pavement
prevents
the
soil
beneath
it
from
losing
its
humidity
by
evaporation
hence
trees
find
moisture
enough
for
their
roots
and
though
plagued
with
smoke
and
dust
often
retain
their
freshness
while
those
planted
in
the
open
fields
where
sun
and
wind
dry
up
the
soil
faster
than
the
subterranean
fountains
can
water

are
withering
from
drought
without
the
help
of
artificial
conduit
or
of
water
carrier
the
thames
and
the

refresh
the
ornamental
trees
that
shade

thoroughfares
of
london
and
of
paris
and
beneath
the
hot
and
reeking
mould
of
egypt
the
nile
sends
currents
to
the
extremest
border
of
its
valley
the
existence
of
artesian
wells
depends
upon
that
of
subterranean
reservoirs
and
rivers
and
the
supply
yielded
by
borings
is
regulated
by
the
abundance
of
such
sources
the
waters
of
the
earth
are
in
many
cases
derived
from
superficial
currents
which
are
seen
to
pour
into
chasms
opened
as
it
were
expressly
for
their
reception
and
in
others
where
no
apertures
in
the
crust
of
the
earth
have
been
detected
their
existence
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
artesian
wells
sometimes
bring
up
from
great
depths
seeds
leaves
and
even
living
fish
which
must
have
been
carried
down
through
channels
large
enough
to
admit
a
considerable
stream
but
in
general
the
sheets
and
currents
of
water
reached
by
deep
boring
appear
to
be
primarily
due
to
infiltration
from
highlands
where
the
water
is
first
collected
in
superficial
or
subterranean
reservoirs
by
means
of
channels
conforming
to
the
dip
of
the
strata
these
reservoirs
communicate
with
the
lower
basins
and
exert
upon
them
a
fluid
pressure
sufficient
to
raise
a
column
to
the
surface
whenever
an
orifice
is
opened
the
water
delivered
by
an
artesian
well
is
therefore
often
derived
from
distant
sources
and
may
be
wholly
unaffected
by
geographical
or
meteorological
changes
in
its
immediate
neighborhood
while
the
same
changes
may
quite
dry
up
common
wells
and
springs
which
are
fed
only
by
the
local
infiltration
of
their
own
narrow
basins
in
most
cases
artesian
wells
have
been
bored
for
purely
economical
or
industrial
purposes
such
as
to
obtain
good
water
for
domestic
use

machinery

reach
saline
or
other
mineral
springs
and
recently
in
america
to
open
fountains
of

or
rock
oil
the
geographical
and
geological
effects
of
such
abstraction
of
fluids
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
are
too
remote
and
uncertain
to
be
here
noticed
but
artesian
wells
have
lately
been
employed
in
algeria
for
a
purpose
which
has
even
now
a
substantial
and
may
hereafter
acquire
a
very
great
geographical
importance
it
was
observed
by
many
earlier
as
well
as
recent
travellers
in
the
east
among
whom
shaw
deserves
special
mention
that
the
libyan
desert
bordering
upon
the
cultivated
shores
of
the
mediterranean
appeared
in
many
places
to
rest
upon
a
subterranean
lake
at
an
accessible
distance
below
the
surface
the
moors
are
vaguely
said
to
have
artesian
wells
down
to
this
reservoir
to
obtain
water
for
domestic
use
and
irrigation
but
i
do
not
find
such
wells
described
by
any
trustworthy
traveller
and
the
universal
astonishment
and
incredulity
with
which
the
native
tribes
viewed
the
operations
of
the
french
engineers
sent
into
the
desert
for
that
purpose
are
a
sufficient
proof
that
this
mode
of
reaching
the
subterranean
waters
was
new
to
them
they
were
however
aware
of
the
existence
of
water
below
the
sands
and
were
dexterous
in
digging
wells
square
shafts
lined
with
a
framework
of
stems
to
the
level
of
the
sheet
the
wells
so
constructed
though
not
technically
artesian
wells
answer
the
same
purpose
for
the
water
rises
to
the
surface
and
flows
over
it
as
from
a
spring
these
wells
however
are
too
few
and
too
scanty
in
supply
to
serve
any
other
purposes
than
the
domestic
wells
of
other
countries
and
it
is
but
recently
that
the
transformation
of
desert
into
cultivable
land
by
this
means
has
been
seriously
attempted
the
french
government
has
bored
a
large
number
of
artesian
wells
in
the
algerian
desert
within
a
few
years
and
the
native
sheikhs
are
beginning
to
avail
themselves
of
the
process
every
well
becomes
the
nucleus
of
a
settlement
proportioned
to
the
supply
of
water
and
before
the
end
of
the
year
several
nomade
tribes
had
abandoned
their
wandering
life
established
themselves
around
the
wells
and
planted
more
than
palm
trees
besides
other
perennial
vegetables
the
water
is
found
at
a
small
depth
generally
from
to
feet
and
though
containing
too
large
a
proportion
of
mineral
matter
to
be
acceptable
to
a
european
palate
it
answers
well
for
irrigation
and
does
not
prove
unwholesome
to
the
natives
the
most
obvious
use
of
artesian
wells
in
the
desert
at
present
is
that
of
creating
stations
for
the
establishment
of
military
posts
and
halting
places
for
the
desert
traveller
but
if
the
supply
of
water
shall
prove
adequate
for
the
indefinite
extension
of
the
system
it
is
probably
destined
to
produce
a
greater
geographical
transformation
than
has
ever
been
effected
by
any
scheme
of
human
improvement
the
most
striking
contrast
of
landscape
scenery
that
nature
brings
near
together
in
time
or
place
is
that
between
the
greenery
of
the
tropics
or
of
a
northern
summer
and
the
snowy
pall
of
leafless
winter
next
to
this
in
startling
novelty
of
effect
we
must
rank
the
sudden
transition
from
the
shady
and
verdant
oasis
of
the
desert
to
the
bare
and
burning
ocean
of
sand
and
rock
which
surrounds
it
the
most
sanguine
believer
in
indefinite
human
progress
hardly
expects
that
man
cunning
will
accomplish
the
universal
fufilment
of
the
prophecy
the
desert
shall
blossom
as
the
rose
in
its
literal
sense
but
sober
geographers
have
thought
the
future
conversion
of
the
sand
plains
of
northern
africa
into
fruitful
gardens
by
means
of
artesian
wells
not
an
improbable
expectation
they
have
gone
farther
and
argued
that
if
the
soil
were
covered
with
fields
and
forests
vegetation
would
call
down
moisture
from
the
libyan
sky
and
that
the
showers
which
are
now
wasted
on
the
sea
or
so
often
deluge
southern
europe
with
destructive
inundation
would
in
part
be
condensed
over
the
arid
wastes
of
africa
and
thus
without
further
aid
from
man
bestow
abundance
on
regions
which
nature
seems
to
have
condemned
to
perpetual
desolation
an
equally
bold
speculation
founded
on
the
fact
that
the
temperature
of
the
earth
and
of
its
internal
waters
increases
as
we
descend
beneath
the
surface
has
suggested
that
artesian
wells
might
supply
heat
for
industrial
and
domestic
purposes
for
cultivation
and
even
for
the
local
amelioration
of
climate
the
success
with
which
count
lardarello
has
employed
natural
hot
springs
for
the
evaporation
of
water
charged
with
boracic
acid
and
other
fortunate
applications
of
the
heat
of
thermal
sources
lend
some
countenance
to
the
latter
project
but
both
must
for
the
present
be
ranked
among
the
vague
possibilities
of
science
not
regarded
as
probable
future
triumphs
of
man
over
nature
a
more
plausible
and
inviting
scheme
is
that
of
the
creation
of
perennial
springs
by
husbanding
rain
and
snow
water
storing
it
up
in
artificial
reservoirs
of
earth
and
filtering
it
through
purifying
strata
in
analogy
with
the
operations
of
nature
the
sagacious
palissy
starting
from
the
theory
that
all
springs
are
primarily
derived
from
precipitation
and
reasoning
justly
on
the
accumulation
and
movement
of
water
in
the
earth
proposed
to
reduce
theory
to
practice
and
to
imitate
the
natural
processes
by
which
rain
is
absorbed
by
the
earth
and
given
out
again
in
running
fountains
when
i
had
long
and
diligently
considered
the
cause
of
the
springing
of
natural
fountains
and
the
places
where
they
be
wont
to
issue
says
he
i
did
plainly
perceive
at
last
that
they
do
proceed
and
are
engendered
of
nought
but
the
rains
and
it
is
this
look
you
which
hath
moved
me
to
enterprise
the
gathering
together
of
rain
water
after
the
manner
of
nature
and
the
most
closely
according
to
her
fashion
that
i
am
able
and
i
am
well
assured
that
by
following
the
formulary
of
the
supreme
contriver
of
fountains
i
can
make
springs
the
water
whereof
shall
be
as
good
and
pure
and
clear
as
of
such
which
be
natural
palissy
discusses
the
subject
of
the
origin
of
springs
at
length
and
with
much
ability
dwelling
specially
on
infiltration
and
among
other
things
thus
explains
the
frequency
of
springs
in
mountainous
regions
having
well
considered
the
which
thou
mayest
plainly
see
the
reason
why
there
be
more
springs
and
rivulets
proceeding
from
the
mountains
than
from
the
rest
of
the
earth
which
is
for
no
other
cause
but
that
the
rocks
and
mountains
do
retain
the
water
of
the
rains
like
vessels
of
brass
and
the
said
waters
falling
upon
the
said
mountains
descend
continually
through
the
earth
and
through
crevices
and
stop
not
till
they
find
some
place
that
is
bottomed
with
stone
or
close
and
thick
rocks
and
they
rest
upon
such
bottom
until
they
find
some
channel
or
other
manner
of
issue
and
then
they
flow
out
in
springs
or
brooks
or
rivers
according
to
the
greatness
of
the
reservoirs
and
of
the
outlets
thereof
after
a
full
exposition
of
his
theory
palissy
proceeds
to
describe
his
method
of
creating
springs
which
is
substantially
the
same
as
that
lately
proposed
by
babinet
in
the
following
terms
choose
a
piece
of
ground
containing
four
or
five
acres
with
a
sandy
soil
and
with
a
gentle
slope
to
determine
the
flow
of
the
water
along
its
upper
line
dig
a
trench
five
or
six
feet
deep
and
six
feet
wide
level
the
bottom
of
the
trench
and
make
it
impermeable
by
paving
by
macadamizing
by
bitumen
or
more
simply
and
cheaply
by
a
layer
of
clay
by
the
side
of
this
trench
dig
another
and
throw
the
earth
from
it
into
the
first
and
so
on
until
you
have
rendered
the
subsoil
of
the
whole
parcel
impermeable
to
rain
water
build
a
wall
along
the
lower
line
with
an
aperture
in
the
middle
for
the
water
and
plant
fruit
or
other
low
trees
upon
the
whole
to
shade
the
ground
and
check
the
currents
of
air
which
promote
evaporation
this
will
infallibly
give
you
a
good
spring
which
will
flow
without
intermission
and
supply
the
wants
of
a
whole
hamlet
or
a
large
chateau
babinet
states
that
the
whole
amount
of
precipitation
on
a
reservoir
of
the
proposed
area
in
the
climate
of
paris
would
be
about
cubic
yards
not
above
one
half
of
which
he
thinks
would
be
lost
and
of
course
the
other
half
would
remain
available
to
supply
the
spring
i
much
doubt
whether
this
expectation
would
be
realized
in
practice
in
its
whole
extent
for
if
babinet
is
right
in
supposing
that
the
summer
rain
is
wholly
evaporated
the
winter
rains
being
much
less
in
quantity
would
hardly
suffice
to
keep
the
earth
saturated
and
give
off
so
large
a
surplus
the
method
of
palissy
though
as
i
have
said
similar
in
principle
to
that
of
babinet
would
be
cheaper
of
execution
and
at
the
same
time
more
efficient
he
proposes
the
construction
of
relatively
small
filtering
receptacles
into
which
he
would
conduct
the
rain
falling
upon
a
large
area
of
rocky
hillside
or
other
sloping
ground
not
readily
absorbing
water
this
process
would
in
all
probability
be
a
very
successful
as
well
as
an
inexpensive
mode
of
economizing
atmospheric
precipitation
and
compelling
the
rain
and
snow
to
form
perennial
fountains
at
will
the
methods
suggested
by
palissy
and
by
babinet
are
of
limited
application
and
designed
only
to
supply
a
sufficient
quantity
of
water
for
the
domestic
use
of
small
villages
or
large
private
establishments
dumas
has
proposed
a
much
more
extensive
system
for
collecting
and
retaining
the
whole
precipitation
in
considerable
valleys
and
storing
it
in
reservoirs
whence
it
is
to
be
drawn
for
household
and
mechanical
purposes
for
irrigation
and
in
short
for
all
the
uses
to
which
the
water
of
natural
springs
and
brooks
is
applicable
his
plan
consists
in
draining
both
surface
and
subsoil
by
means
of
conduits
differing
in
construction
according
to
local
circumstances
but
in
the
main
not
unlike
those
employed
in
improved
agriculture
collecting
the
water
in
a
central
channel
securing
its
proper
filterage
checking
its
too
rapid
flow
by
barriers
at
convenient
points
and
finally
receiving
the
whole
in
spacious
covered
reservoirs
from
which
it
may
be
discharged
in
a
constant
flow
or
at
intervals
as
convenience
may
dictate
there
is
no
reasonable
doubt
that
a
very
wide
employment
of
these
various
contrivances
for
economizing
and
supplying
water
is
practicable
and
the
expediency
of
resorting
to
them
is
almost
purely
an
economical
question
there
appears
to
be
no
serious
reason
to
apprehend
collateral
evils
from
them
and
in
fact
all
of
them
except
artesian
wells
are
simply
indirect
methods
of
returning
to
the
original
arrangements
of
nature
or
in
other
words
of
restoring
the
fluid
circulation
of
the
globe
for
when
the
earth
was
covered
with
the
forest
perennial
springs
gushed
from
the
foot
of
every
hill
brooks
flowed
down
the
bed
of
every
valley
the
partial
recovery
of
the
fountains
and
rivulets
which
once
abundantly
watered
the
face
of
the
agricultural
world
seems
practicable
by
such
means
even
without
any
general
replanting
of
the
forests
and
the
cost
of
one
year
warfare
if
judiciously
expended
in
a
combination
of
both
methods
of
improvement
would
secure
to
almost
every
country
that
man
has
exhausted
an
amelioration
of
climate
a
renovated
fertility
of
soil
and
a
general
physical
improvement

might
almost
be
characterized

there

renders
it

where
the

equally
inadmissible
in

the
quartz
grains
are
the
most
numerous
but
this
is
not
a
proof
that
the
rocks
from
which
these

were
derived
were
wholly

even
chiefly
quartzose
in
character

in

composite
rocks

for
example
in

group
the
mica
felspar
and

are
more
easily

comminuted

than
the

in

the
greater

doubtless
aids
in

they
were

the
large
masses
of

not
found
in

have
been
transported
and
accumulated
by
water
or
by
wind
the
former
being
generally
considered
the
most
important
of
these
agencies
for
the
extensive
deposits
of
the
sahara
of
the
deserts
of
persia
and
of
that
of
gobi
are
commonly
supposed
to
have
been
swept
together
or
distributed
by
marine
currents
and
to
have
been
elevated
above
the
ocean
by
the
same
means
as
other
upheaved
strata
meteoric
and
mechanical
influences
are
still
active
in
the
reduction
of
rocks
to
a
fragmentary
state
but
the
quantity
of
sand
now
transported
to
the
sea
seems
to
be
comparatively
inconsiderable
because
not
to
speak
of
the
absence
of
diluvial
action
the
number
of
torrents
emptying
directly
into
the
sea
is
much
less
than
it
was
at
earlier
periods
the
formation
of
alluvial
plains
in
maritime
bays
by
the
sedimentary
matter
brought
down
from
the
mountains
has
lengthened
the
flow
of
such
streams
and
converted
them
very
generally
into
rivers
or
rather
affluents
of
rivers
much
younger
than
themselves
the
filling
up
of
the
estuaries
has
so
reduced
the
slope
of
all
large
and
many
small
rivers
and
consequently
so
checked
the
current
of
what
the
germans
call
their
or
lower
course
that
they
are
much
less
able
to
transport
heavy
material
than
at
earlier
epochs
the
slime
deposited
by
rivers
at
their
junction
with
the
sea
is
usually
found
to
be
composed
of
material
too
finely
ground
and
too
light
to
be
denominated
sand
and
it
can
be
abundantly
shown
that
the
sandbanks
at
the
outlet
of
large
streams
are
of
tidal
not
of
fluviatile
origin
or
in
lakes
and
tideless
seas
a
result
of
the
concurrent
action
of
waves
and
of
wind
large
deposits
of
sand
therefore
must
in
general
be
considered
as
of
ancient
not
of
recent
formation
and
many
eminent
geologists
ascribe
them
to
diluvial
action
staring
has
discussed
this
question
very
fully
with
special
reference
to
the
sands
of
the
north
sea
the
zuiderzee
and
the
bays
and
channels
of
the
dutch
coast
his
general
conclusion
is
that
the
rivers
of
the
netherlands
move
sand
only
by
a
very
slow
displacement
of
sandbanks
and
do
not
carry
it
with
them
as
a
suspended
or
floating
material
the
sands
of
the
german
ocean
he
holds
to
be
a
product
of
the
great
north
german
drift
deposited
where
they
now
lie
before
the
commencement
of
the
present
geological
period
and
he
maintains
similar
opinions
with
regard
to
the
sands
thrown
up
by
the
mediterranean
at
the
mouths
of
the
nile
and
on
the
barbary
coast
now
carried
to
the
there
are
however
cases
where
mountain
streams
still
bear
to
the
sea
perhaps
relatively
small
but
certainly
absolutely
large
amounts
of
disintegrated
rock
the
quantity
of
sand
and
gravel
carried
into
the
mediterranean
by
the
torrents
of
the
maritime
alps
the
ligurian
apennines
the
islands
of
corsica
sardinia
and
sicily
and
the
mountains
of
calabria
is
apparently
great
in
mere
mass
it
is
possible
if
not
probable
that
as
much
rocky
material
more
or
less
comminuted
is
contributed
to
the
basin
of
the
mediterranean
by
europe
even
excluding
the
shores
of
the
adriatic
and
the
euxine
as
is
washed
up
from
it
upon
the
coasts
of
africa
and
syria
a
great
part
of
this
material
is
thrown
out
again
by
the
waves
on
the
european
shores
of
that
sea
the
harbors
of
luni
albenga
san
remo
and
savona
west
of
genoa
and
of
porto
fino
on
the
other
side
are
filling
up
and
the
coast
near
carrara
and
massa
is
said
to
have
advanced
upon
the
sea
to
a
distance
of
feet
in
years
besides
this
we
have
no
evidence
of
the
existence
of
currents
in
the
mediterranean
extensive
enough
and
strong
enough
to
transport
quartzose
sand
across
the
sea
it
may
be
added
that
much
of
the
rock
from
which
the
torrent
sands
of
southern
europe
are
derived
contains
little
quartz
and
hence
the
general
character
of
these
sands
is
such
that
they
must
be
decomposed
or
ground
down
to
an
impalpable
slime
long
before
they
could
be
swept
over
to
the
african
shore
the
torrents
of
europe
then
do
not
at
present
furnish
the
material
which
composes
the
beach
sands
of
northern
africa
and
it
is
equally
certain
that
those
sands
are
not
brought
down
by
the
rivers
of
the
latter
continent
they
belong
to
a
remote
geological
period
and
have
been
accumulated
by
causes
which
we
can
not
at
present
assign
the
wind
does
not
stir
water
to
great
depths
with
sufficient
force
to
disturb
the
bottom
and
the
sand
thrown
upon
the
coast
in
question
must
be
derived
from
a
narrow
belt
of
sea
it
must
hence
in
time
become
exhausted
and
the
formation
of
new
sandbanks
and
dunes
upon
the
southern
shores
of
the
mediterranean
will
cease
at
last
for
want
of
material
but
even
in
the
cases
where
the
accumulations
of
sand
in
extensive
deserts
appear
to
be
of
marine
formation
or
rather
aggregation
and
to
have
been
brought
to
their
present
position
by
upheaval
they
are
not
wholly
composed
of
material
collected
or
distributed
by
the
currents
of
the
sea
for
in
all
such
regions
they
continue
to
receive
some
small
contributions
from
the
disintegration
of
the
rocks
which
underlie
or
crop
out
through
the
superficial
deposits
in
some
instances
too
as
in
northern
africa
additions
are
constantly
made
to
the
mass
by
the
prevalence
of
sea
winds
which
transport
or
to
speak
more
precisely
roll
the
finer
beach
sand
to
considerable
distances
into
the
interior
but
this
is
a
very
slow
process
and
the
exaggerations
of
travellers
have
diffused
a
vast
deal
of
popular
error
on
the
subject
of
in
the
narrow
valley
of
the
nile
which
above
its
bifurcation
near
cairo
is
throughout
egypt
and
nubia
generally
bounded
by
precipitous
cliffs
wherever
a
ravine
or
other
considerable
depression
occurs
in
the
wall
of
rock
one
sees
what
seems
a
stream
of
desert
sand
pouring
down
and
common
observers
have
hence
concluded
that
the
whole
valley
is
in
danger
of
being
buried
under
a
stratum
of
infertile
soil
the
ancient
egyptians
apprehended
this
and
erected
walls
often
of
unburnt
brick
across
the
outlet
of
gorges
and
lateral
valleys
to
check
the
flow
of
the
sand
streams
in
later
ages
these
walls
have
mostly
fallen
into
decay
and
no
preventive
measures
against
such
encroachments
are
now
resorted
to
but
the
extent
of
the
mischief
to
the
soil
of
egypt
and
the
future
danger
from
this
source
have
been
much
overrated
the
sand
on
the
borders
of
the
nile
is
neither
elevated
so
high
by
the
wind
nor
transported
by
that
agency
in
so
great
masses
as
is
popularly
supposed
and
of
that
which
is
actually
lifted
or
rolled
and
finally
deposited
by
air
currents
a
considerable
proportion
is
either
calcareous
and
therefore
readily
decomposable
or
in
the
state
of
a
very
fine
dust
and
so
in
neither
case
injurious
to
the
soil
there
are
indeed
both
in
africa
and
in
arabia
considerable
tracts
of
fine
silicious
sand
which
may
be
carried
far
by
high
winds
but
these
are
exceptional
cases
and
in
general
the
progress
of
the
desert
sand
is
by
a
rolling
motion
along
the
surface
so
little
is
it
lifted
and
so
inconsiderable
is
the
quantity
yet
remaining
on
the
borders
of
egypt
that
a
wall
four
or
five
feet
high
suffices
for
centuries
to
check
its
encroachments
this
is
obvious
to
the
eye
of
every
observer
who
prefers
the
true
to
the
marvellous
but
the
fable
of
the
overwhelming
of
caravans
by
the
fearful
simoom
which
even
the
arabs
no
longer
repeat
if
indeed
they
are
the
authors
of
it
is
so
thoroughly
rooted
in
the
imagination
of
christendom
that
most
desert
travellers
of
the
tourist
class
think
they
shall
disappoint
the
readers
of
their
journals
if
they
do
not
recount
the
particulars
of
their
escape
from
being
buried
alive
by
a
sand
storm
and
the
popular
demand
for
a
sensation
must
be
gratified
accordingly
another
circumstance
is
necessary
to
be
considered
in
estimating
the
danger
to
which
the
arable
lands
of
egypt
are
exposed
the
prevailing
wind
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
and
its
borders
is
from
the
north
and
it
may
be
said
without
exaggeration
that
the
north
wind
blows
for
three
quarters
of
the
year
the
effect
of
winds
blowing
up
the
valley
is
to
drive
the
sands
of
the
desert
plateau
which
border
it
in
a
direction
parallel
with
the
axis
of
the
valley
not
transversely
to
it
and
if
it
ran
in
a
straight
line
the
north
wind
would
carry
no
desert
sand
into
it
there
are
however
both
curves
and
angles
in
its
course
and
hence
wherever
its
direction
deviates
from
that
of
the
wind
it
might
receive
sand
drifts
from
the
desert
plain
through
which
it
runs
but
in
the
course
of
ages
the
winds
have
in
a
great
measure
bared
the
projecting
points
of
their
ancient
deposits
and
no
great
accumulations
remain
in
situations
from
which
either
a
north
or
a
south
wind
would
carry
them
into
the
valley
suez
these
considerations
apply
with
equal
force
to
the
supposed
danger
of
the
obstruction
of
the
suez
canal
by
the
drifting
of
the
desert
sands
the
winds
across
the
isthmus
are
almost
uniformly
from
the
north
and
they
swept
it
clean
of
flying
sands
long
ages
since
the
traces
of
the
ancient
canal
between
the
red
sea
and
the
nile
are
easily
followed
for
a
considerable
distance
from
suez
had
the
drifts
upon
the
isthmus
been
as
formidable
as
some
have
feared
and
others
have
hoped
those
traces
would
have
been
obliterated
and
lake
timsah
and
the
bitter
lakes
filled
up
many
centuries
ago
the
few
particles
driven
by
the
rare
east
and
west
winds
toward
the
line
of
the
canal
would
easily
be
arrested
by
plantations
or
other
simple
methods
or
removed
by
dredging
the
real
dangers
and
difficulties
of
this
magnificent
enterprise
and
they
are
great
consist
in
the
nature
of
the
soil
to
be
removed
in
order
to
form
the
line
and
especially
in
the
constantly
increasing
accumulation
of
sea
sand
at
the
southern
terminus
by
the
tides
of
the
red
sea
and
at
the
northern
by
the
action
of
the
winds
both
seas
are
shallow
for
miles
from
the
shore
and
the
excavation
and
maintenance
of
deep
channels
and
of
capacious
harbors
with
easy
and
secure
entrances
in
such
localities
is
doubtless
one
of
the
hardest
problems
offered
to
modern
engineers
for
practical
solution
of
the
sand
let
fall
in
egypt
by
the
north
wind
is
derived
not
from
the
desert
but
from
a
very
different
source
the
sea
considerable
quantities
of
sand
are
thrown
up
by
the
mediterranean
at
and
between
the
mouths
of
the
nile
and
indeed
along
almost
the
whole
southern
coast
of
that
sea
and
drifted
into
the
interior
to
distances
varying
according
to
the
force
of
the
wind
and
the
abundance
and
quality
of
the
material
the
sand
so
transported
contributes
to
the
gradual
elevation
of
the
delta
and
of
the
banks
and
bed
of
the
river
itself
but
just
in
proportion
as
the
bed
of
the
stream
is
elevated
the
height
of
the
water
in
the
annual
inundations
is
increased
also
and
as
the
inclination
of
the
channel
is
diminished
the
rapidity
of
the
current
is
checked
and
the
deposition
of
the
slime
it
holds
in
suspension
consequently
promoted
thus
the
winds
and
the
water
moving
in
contrary
directions
join
in
producing
a
common
effect
the
sand
blown
over
the
delta
and
the
cultivated
land
higher
up
the
stream
during
the
inundation
is
covered
or
mixed
with
the
fertile
earth
brought
down
by
the
river
and
no
serious
injury
is
sustained
from
it
that
spread
over
the
same
ground
after
the
water
has
subsided
and
during
the
short
period
when
the
soil
is
not
stirred
by
cultivation
or
covered
by
the
flood
forms
a
thin
pellicle
over
the
surface
as
far
as
it
extends
and
serves
to
divide
and
distinguish
the
successive
layers
of
slime
deposited
by
the
annual
inundations
the
particles
taken
up
by
the
wind
on
the
sea
beach
are
borne
onward
by
a
hopping
motion
or
rolled
along
the
surface
until
they
are
arrested
by
the
temporary
cessation
of
the
wind
by
vegetation
or
by
some
other
obstruction
and
they
may
in
process
of
time
accumulate
in
large
masses
under
the
lee
of
rocky
projections
buildings
or
other
barriers
which
break
the
force
of
the
wind
in
these
facts
we
find
the
true
explanation
of
the
sand
drifts
which
have
half
buried
the
sphinx
and
so
many
other
ancient
monuments
in
that
part
of
egypt
these
drifts
as
i
have
said
are
not
primarily
from
the
desert
but
from
the
sea
and
as
might
be
supposed
from
the
distance
they
have
travelled
they
have
been
long
in
gathering
while
egypt
was
a
great
and
flourishing
kingdom
measures
were
taken
to
protect
its
territory
against
the
encroachment
of
sand
whether
from
the
desert
or
from
the
sea
but
the
foreign
conquerors
who
destroyed
so
many
of
its
religious
monuments
did
not
spare
its
public
works
and
the
process
of
physical
degradation
undoubtedly
began
as
early
as
the
persian
invasion
the
urgent
necessity
which
has
compelled
all
the
successive
tyrannies
of
egypt
to
keep
up
some
of
the
canals
and
other
arrangements
for
irrigation
was
not
felt
with
respect
to
the
advancement
of
the
sands
for
their
progress
was
so
slow
as
hardly
to
be
perceptible
in
the
course
of
a
single
reign
and
long
experience
has
shown
that
from
the
natural
effect
of
the
inundations
the
cultivable
soil
of
the
valley
is
on
the
whole
trenching
upon
the
domain
of
the
desert
not
retreating
before
it
the
oases
of
the
libyan
as
well
as
of
many
asiatic
deserts
have
no
such
safeguards
the
sands
are
fast
encroaching
upon
them
and
threaten
soon
to
engulf
them
unless
man
shall
resort
to
artesian
wells
and
plantations
or
to
some
other
efficient
means
of
checking
the
advance
of
this
formidable
enemy
in
time
to
save
these
islands
of
the
waste
from
final
destruction
accumulations
of
sand
are
in
certain
cases
beneficial
as
a
protection
against
the
ravages
of
the
sea
but
in
general
the
vicinity
and
especially
the
shifting
of
bodies
of
this
material
are
destructive
to
human
industry
and
hence
in
civilized
countries
measures
are
taken
to
prevent
its
spread
this
however
can
be
done
only
where
the
population
is
large
and
enlightened
and
the
value
of
the
soil
or
of
the
artificial
erections
and
improvements
upon
it
is
considerable
hence
in
the
deserts
of
africa
and
of
asia
and
the
inhabited
lands
which
border
on
them
no
pains
are
usually
taken
to
check
the
drifts
and
when
once
the
fields
the
houses
the
springs
or
the
canals
of
irrigation
are
covered
or
choked
the
district
is
abandoned
without
a
struggle
and
surrendered
to
perpetual
desolation
dunes
and
sand
two
forms
of
sand
deposit
are
specially
important
in
european
and
american
geography
the
one
is
that
of
dune
or
shifting
hillock
upon
the
coast
the
other
that
of
barren
plain
in
the
interior
the
coast
dunes
are
composed
of
sand
washed
up
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
by
the
waves
and
heaped
in
knolls
and
ridges
by
the
winds
the
sand
with
which
many
plains
are
covered
appears
sometimes
to
have
been
deposited
upon
them
while
they
were
yet
submerged
sometimes
to
have
been
drifted
from
the
sea
coast
and
scattered
over
them
by
wind
currents
sometimes
to
have
been
washed
upon
them
by
running
water
in
these
latter
cases
the
deposit
though
in
itself
considerable
is
comparatively
narrow
in
extent
and
irregular
in
distribution
while
in
the
former
it
is
often
evenly
spread
over
a
very
wide
surface
in
all
great
bodies
of
either
sort
the
silicious
grains
are
the
principal
constituent
though
when
not
resulting
from
the
disintegration
of
silicious
rock
and
still
remaining
in
place
they
are
generally
accompanied
with
a
greater
or
less
admixture
of
other
mineral
particles
and
of
animal
and
vegetable
remains
and
they
are
also
usually
somewhat
changed
in
consistence
by
the
conditions
of
temperature
and
moisture
to
which
they
have
been
exposed
since
their
deposit
unless
the
proportion
of
these
latter
ingredients
is
so
large
as
to
create
a
certain
adhesiveness
in
the
mass
in
which
case
it
can
no
longer
properly
be
called
sand
it
is
infertile
and
if
not
charged
with
water
partially
agglutinated
by
iron
lime
or
other
cement
or
confined
by
alluvion
resting
upon
it
it
is
much
inclined
to
drift
whenever
by
any
chance
the
vegetable
network
which
in
most
cases
thinly
clothes
and
at
the
same
time
confines
it
is
broken
human
industry
has
not
only
fixed
the
flying
dunes
but
by
mixing
clay
and
other
tenacious
earths
with
the
superficial
stratum
of
extensive
sand
plains
and
by
the
application
of
fertilizing
substances
it
has
made
them
abundantly
productive
of
vegetable
life
these
latter
processes
belong
to
agriculture
and
not
to
geography
and
therefore
are
not
embraced
within
the
scope
of
the
present
subject
but
the
preliminary
steps
whereby
wastes
of
loose
drifting
barren
sands
are
transformed
into
wooded
knolls
and
plains
and
finally
through
the
accumulation
of
vegetable
mould
into
arable
ground
constitute
a
conquest
over
nature
which
precedes
agriculture
a
geographical
revolution
and
therefore
an
account
of
the
means
by
which
the
change
has
been
effected
belongs
properly
to
the
history
of

the
great
features
of

i
proceed
then
to
examine
the
structure
of

and
to
describe
the
warfare
man
wages
with
the
sand
hills
striving
on
the
one
hand
to
maintain
and
even
extend
them
as
a
natural
barrier
against
encroachments
of
the

on
the
other

their

and
sometimes
of
lakes
on
most
coasts
the
supply
of
sand
for
the
formation
of
dunes
is
derived
from
tidal
waves
the
flow
of
the
tide
is
more
rapid
and
consequently
its
transporting
power
greater
than
that
of
the
ebb
the
momentum
acquired
by
the
heavy
particles
in
rolling
in
with
the
water
tends
to
carry
them
even
beyond
the
flow
of
the
waves
and
at
the
turn
of
the
tide
the
water
is
in
a
state
of
repose
long
enough
to
allow
it
to
let
fall
much
of
the
solid
matter
it
holds
in
suspension
hence
on
all
low
coasts
of
seas
with
sandy
bottoms
there
exist
several
conditions
favorable
to
the
formation
of
sand
deposits
along

if
the
land
winds
are
of
greater
frequency
duration
or
strength
than
the
sea
winds
the
sands
left
by
the
retreating
wave
will
be
constantly
blown
back
into
the
water
but
if
the
prevailing
air
currents
are
in
the
opposite
direction
the
sands
will
soon
be
carried
out
of
the
reach
of
the

and
transported
continually
farther
and
farther
into

of

unless
obstructed
by

the

though
a
usual
is
by
no
means
a
necessary
condition
for
the

of

out
of

are
formed
the

the

almost
tideless

there
are

on
the

of

and
at

other

the
vast
shoals
in

known
to
the
ancients
as
the

are
of

they
are
still
filling
up
with
sand
washed
up
from
greater
depths
or
sometimes
drifted
from
the
coast
in
small
quantities
and
will
probably
be
converted
at
some
future
period
into
dry
land
covered
with
sand
hills
there
are
also
extensive
ranges
of
dunes
upon
the
eastern
shores
of
the
caspian
and
at
the
southern
or
rather
southeastern
extremity
of
lake
michigan
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
latter
lake
formerly
extended
much
farther
in
that
direction
but
its
southern
portion
has
gradually
shoaled
and
at
last
been
converted
into
solid
land
in
consequence
of
the
prevalence
of
the
northwest
winds
these
blow
over
the
lake
a
large
part
of
the
year
and
create
a
southwardly
set
of
the
currents
which
wash
up

from

of

and
throw
it
on

sand
is
taken
up
from

at

city
by
every

from
that
quarter
and
after
a
heavy
blow
of
some
hours
duration
sand
ridges
may
be
observed
on
the
north
side
of
the

like
the

deposited
by
a

in

some
of

but
most
of
them
lodge
on
or
behind
the

or
in
the
moist
soil
near
the
lake
or
are
entangled
by
vegetables
and
tend
permanently
to
elevate
the
level
like
effects
are
produced
by
constant

winds
and
dunes
will
generally
be
formed
on
all
low
coasts
where
such
prevail
whether
in
tideless
or
in
tidal
waters
jobard
thus
describes
the
under
ordinary
circumstances
at
the
mouths
of
the
nile
where
a
tide
can
scarcely
be
detected
when
a
wave
breaks
it
deposits
an
almost
imperceptible
line
of
fine
sand
the
next
wave
brings
also
its
contribution
and
shoves
the
preceding
line
a
little
higher
as
soon
as
the
particles
are
fairly
out
of
the
reach
of
the
water
they
are
dried
by
the
heat
of
the
burning
sun
and
immediately
seized
by
the
wind
and
rolled
or
borne
farther
inland
the
gravel
is
not
thrown
out
by
the
waves
but
rolls
backward
and
forward
until
it
is
worn
down
to
the
state
of
fine
sand
when
it
in
its
turn
is
cast
upon
the
land
and
taken
up
by
the
wind
this
description
applies
only
to
the
common
action
of
wind
and
water
but
just
in
proportion
to
the
increasing
force
of
the
wind
and
the
waves
there
is
an
increase
in
the
quantity
of
sand
and
in
the
magnitude
of
the
particles
carried
off
from
the
beach
by
it
and
of
course
every
storm
in
a
landward
direction
adds
sensibly
to
the
accumulation
upon
the
shore
although
dunes
properly
so
called
are
found
only
on
dry
land
and
above
ordinary
mark
and
owe
their
elevation
and
structure
to
the
action
of
the
wind
yet
upon
many
shelving
coasts
accumulations
of
sand
much
resembling
dunes
are
formed
under
water
at
some
distance
from
the
shore
by
the
oscillations
of
the
waves
and
are
well
known
by
the
name
of
sand
banks
they
are
usually
rather
ridges
than
banks
of
moderate
inclination
and
with
the
steepest
slope
seaward
and
their
form
differs
from
that
of
dunes
only
in
being
lower
and
more
continuous
upon
the
western
coast
of
the
island
of
amrum
for
example
there
are
three
rows
of
such
banks
the
summits
of
which
are
at
a
distance
of
perhaps
a
couple
of
miles
from
each
other
so
that
including
the
width
of
the
banks
themselves
the
spaces
between
them
and
the
breadth
of
the
zone
of
dunes
upon
the
land
the
belt
of
moving
sands
on
that
coast
is
probably
not
less
than
eight
miles
wide
under
ordinary
circumstances
sand
banks
are
always
rolling
landward
and
they
compose
the
magazine
from
which
the
material
for
the
dunes
is
derived
the
dunes
in
fact
are
but
aquatic
sand
banks
transferred
to
dry
land
the
laws
of
their
formation
are
closely
analogous
because
the
action
of
the
two
fluids
by
which
they
are
respectively
accumulated
and
built
up
is
very
similar
when
brought
to
bear
upon
loose
particles
of
solid
matter
it
would
indeed
seem
that
the
slow
and
comparatively
regular
movements
of
the
heavy
unelastic
water
ought
to
affect
such
particles
very
differently
from
the
sudden
and
fitful
impulses
of
the
light
and
elastic
air
but
the
velocity
of
the
wind
currents
gives
them
a
mechanical
force
approximating
to
that
of
the
slower
waves
and
however
difficult
it
may
be
to
explain
all
the
phenomena
that
characterize
the
structure
of
the
dunes
observation
has
proved
that
it
is
nearly
identical
with
that
of
submerged
sand
banks
the
differences
of
form
are
generally
ascribable
to
the
greater
number
and
variety
of
surface
accidents
of
the
ground
on
which
the
sand
hills
of
the
land
are
built
up
and
to
the
more
frequent
changes
and
wider
variety
of
direction
in
the
courses
of
the
wind
on
the
coast
of
upon
the
atlantic
coast
of
the
united
states
the
prevalence
of
western
or
winds
is
unfavorable
to
the
formation
of
dunes
and
though
marine
currents
lodge
vast
quantities
of
sand
in
the
form
of
banks
on
that
coast
its
shores
are
proportionally
more
free
from
sand
hills
than
some
others
of
lesser
extent
there
are
however
very
important
exceptions
the
action
of
the
tide
throws
much
sand
upon
some
points
of
the
new
england
coast
as
well
as
upon
the
beaches
of
long
island
and
other
more
southern
shores
and
here
dunes
resembling
those
of
europe
are
formed
there
are
also
extensive
ranges
of
dunes
on
the
pacific
coast
of
the
united
states
and
at
san
francisco
they
border
some
of
the
streets
of
the
city
the
dunes
of
america
are
far
older
than
her
civilization
and
the
soil
they
threaten
or
protect
possesses
in
general
too
little
value
to
justify
any
great
expenditure
in
measures
for
arresting
their
progress
or
preventing
their
destruction
hence
great
as
is
their
extent
and
their
geographical
importance
they
have
at
present
no
such
intimate
relations
to
human
life
as
to
render
them
objects
of
special
interest
in
the
point
of
view
i
am
taking
and
i
do
not
know
that
the
laws
of
their
formation
and
motion
have
been
made
a
subject
of
original
investigation
by
any
american
observer
of
western
upon
the
western
coast
of
europe
on
the
contrary
the
ravages
occasioned
by
the
movement
of
sand
dunes
and
the
serious
consequences
often
resulting
from
the
destruction
of
them
have
long
engaged
the
earnest
attention
of
governments
and
of
scientific
men
and
for
nearly
a
century
persevering
and
systematic
effort
has
been
made
to
bring
them
under
human
control
the
subject
has
been
carefully
studied
in
denmark
and
the
adjacent
duchies
in
western
prussia
in
the
netherlands
and
in
france
and
the
experiments
in
the
way
of
arresting
the
drifting
of
the
dunes
and
of
securing
them
and
the
lands
they
shelter
from
the
encroachments
of
the
sea
have
resulted
in
the
adoption
of
a
system
of
coast
improvement
substantially
the
same
in
all
these
countries
the
sands
like
the
forests
have
now
their
special
literature
and
the
volumes
and
memoirs
which
describe
them
and
the
processes
employed
to
subdue
them
are
full
of
scientific
interest
and
of
practical
instruction
of
the
laws
which
govern
the
formation
of
dunes
are
substantially
these
we
have
seen
that
under
certain
conditions
sand
is
accumulated
above
mark
on
low
sea
and
lake
shores
so
long
as
the
sand
is
kept
wet
by
the
spray
or
by
capillary
attraction
it
is
not
disturbed
by
air
currents
but
as
soon
as
the
waves
retire
sufficiently
to
allow
it
to
dry
it
becomes
the
sport
of
the
wind
and
is
driven
up
the
gently
sloping
beach
until
it
is
arrested
by
stones
vegetables
or
other
obstructions
and
thus
an
accumulation
is
formed
which
constitutes
the
foundation
of
a
dune
however
slight
the
elevation
thus
created
it
serves
to
stop
or
retard
the
progress
of
the
sand
grains
which
are
driven
against
its
shoreward
face
and
to
protect
from
the
further
influence
of
the
wind
the
particles
which
are
borne
beyond
it
or
rolled
over
its
crest
and
fall
down
behind
it
if
the
shore
above
the
beach
line
were
perfectly
level
and
straight
the
grass
or
bushes
upon
it
of
equal
height
the
sand
thrown
up
by
the
waves
uniform
in
size
and
weight
of
particles
as
well
as
in
distribution
and
if
the
action
of
the
wind
were
steady
and
regular
a
continuous
bank
would
be
formed
everywhere
alike
in
height
and
cross
section
but
no
such
constant
conditions
anywhere
exist
the
banks
are
curved
broken
unequal
in
elevation
they
are
sometimes
bare
sometimes
clothed
with
vegetables
of
different
structure
and
dimensions
the
sand
thrown
up
is
variable
in
quantity
and
character
and
the
winds
are
shifting
gusty
vortical
and
often
blowing
in
very
narrow
currents
from
all
these
causes
instead
of
uniform
hills
there
rise
irregular
rows
of
sand
heaps
and
these
as
would
naturally
be
expected
are
of
a
pyramidal
or
rather
conical
shape
and
connected
at
bottom
by
more
or
less
continuous
ridges
of
the
same
material
on
a
receding
coast
dunes
will
not
attain
so
great
a
height
as
on
more
secure
shores
because
they
are
undermined
and
carried
off
before
they
have
time
to
reach
their
greatest
dimensions
hence
while
at
sheltered
points
in
southwestern
france
there
are
dunes
three
hundred
feet
or
more
in
height
those
on
the
frisic
islands
and
the
exposed
parts
of
the
coast
of
range
only
from
twenty
to
one
hundred
feet
on
the
western
shores
of
africa
it
is
said
that
they
sometimes
attain
an
elevation
of
six
hundred
feet
this
is
one
of
the
very
few
points
known
to
geographers
where
desert
sands
are
advancing
seaward
and
here
they
rise
to
the
greatest
altitude
to
which
sand
grains
can
be
carried
by
the
wind
the
hillocks
once
deposited
are
held
together
and
kept
in
shape
partly
by
mere
gravity
and
partly
by
the
slight
cohesion
of
the
lime
clay
and
organic
matter
mixed
with
the
sand
and
it
is
observed
that
from
capillary
attraction
evaporation
from
lower
strata
and
retention
of
rain
water
they
are
always
moist
a
little
below
the
surface
by
successive
accumulations
they
gradually
rise
to
the
height
of
thirty
fifty
sixty
or
a
hundred
feet
and
sometimes
even
much
higher
strong
winds
instead
of
adding
to
their
elevation
sweep
off
loose
particles
from
their
surface
and
these
with
others
blown
over
or
between
them
build
up
a
second
row
of
dunes
and
so
on
according
to
the
character
of
the
wind
the
supply
and
consistence
of
the
sand
and
the
face
of
the
country
in
this
way
is
formed
a
belt
of
sand
dunes
irregularly
dispersed
and
varying
much
in
height
and
dimensions
and
some
times
many
miles
in
breadth
on
the
island
of
sylt
in
the
german
sea
where
there
are
several
rows
the
width
of
the
belt
is
from
half
a
mile
to
a
mile
there
are
similar
ranges
on
the
coast
of
holland
exceeding
two
miles
in
breadth
while
at
the
mouths
of
the
nile
they
form
a
zone
not
less
than
ten
miles
wide
the
base
of
some
of
the
dunes
in
the
delta
of
the
nile
is
reached
by
the
river
during
the
annual
inundation
and
the
infiltration
of
the
water
which
contains
lime
has
converted
the
lower
strata
into
a
silicious
limestone
or
rather
a
calcareous
sandstone
and
thus
afforded
an
opportunity
of
studying
the
structure
of
that
rock
in
a
locality
where
its
origin
and
mode
of
aggregation
and
solidification
are
known
of
dune
dune
sand
says
staring
consists
of
grains
of
quartz
more
or
less
colored
by
iron
and
often
mingled
with
fragments
of
shells
small
indeed
but
still
visible
to
the
naked
eye
these
fragments
are
not
constant
constituents
of
dune
sand
they
are
sometimes
found
at
the
very
summits
of
the
hillocks
as
at
overveen
in
the
dune
near
egmond
they
form
a
coarse
calcareous
gravel
very
largely
distributed
through
the
sand
while
the
interior
dunes
between
haarlem
and
warmond
exhibit
no
trace
of
them
it
is
yet
undecided
whether
the
presence
or
absence
of
these
fragments
is
determined
by
the
period
of
the
formation
of
the
dunes
or
whether
it
depends
on
a
difference
in
the
process
by
which
different
dunes
have
been
accumulated
land
shells
such
as
snails
for
example
are
found
on
the
surface
of
the
dunes
in
abundance
and
many
of
the
shelly
fragments
in
the
interior
of
the
hillocks
may
be
derived
from
the
same
source
kohl
has
some
poetical
thoughts
upon
the
origin
and
character
of
the
dune
sands
which
are
worth
quoting
the
sand
was
composed
of
pure
transparent
quartz
i
could
not
observe
this
sand
without
the
greatest
admiration
if
it
is
the
product
of
the
waves
breaking
and
crushing
flints
and
fragments
of
quartz
against
each
other
it
is
a
result
which
could
be
brought
about
only
in
the
course
of
countless
ages
we
need
not
lift
ourselves
to
the
stars
to
their
incalculable
magnitudes
and
distances
and
numbers
in
order
to
feel
the
giddiness
of
astonishment
here
upon
earth
in
the
simple
sand
we
find
miracle
enough
think
of
the
number
of
sand
grains
contained
in
a
single
dune
then
of
all
the
dunes
upon
this
widely
extended
coast
not
to
speak
of
the
innumerable
grains
in
the
arabian
african
and
prussian
deserts
this
of
itself
is
sufficient
to
overwhelm
a
thoughtful
fancy
how
long
how
many
times
must
the
waves
have
risen
and
sunk
in
order
to
reduce
these
vast
heaps
to
powder
during
the
whole
time
i
spent
on
this
coast
i
had
always
some
sand
in
my
fingers
was
rubbing
and
rolling
it
about
examining
it
on
all
sides
holding
a
little
shining
grain
on
the
tip
of
my
finger
and
thinking
to
myself
how
in
its
corners
its
angles
its
whole
configuration
it
might
very
probably
have
a
history
longer
than
that
of
the
old
german
nation
possibly
longer
than
that
of
the
human
race
where
was
the
original
quartz
crystal
of
which
this
is
a
fragment
first
formed
to
what
was
it
once
fixed
what
power
broke
it
loose
how
was
it
beaten
smaller
and
ever
smaller
by
the
waves
they
tossed
it
for
æons
to
and
fro
upon
the
beach
rolled
it
up
and
down
forced
it
to
make
thousands
and
thousands
of
daily
voyages
for
millions
and
millions
of
days
then
the
wind
bore
it
away
and
used
it
in
building
up
a
dune
there
it
lay
for
centuries
packed
in
with
its
fellows
protecting
the
marshes
and
cherished
by
the
inhabitants
till
seized
again
by
the
pursuing
sea
it
fell
once
more
into
the
water
there
to
begin
the
endless
dance
anew
and
again
to
be
swept
away
by
the
wind
and
again
to
find
rest
in
the
dunes
a
protection
and
a
blessing
to
the
coast
there
is
something
mysterious
about
such
a
grain
of
sand
and
at
last
i
went
so
far
as
to
fancy
a
little
immortal
spark
linked
with
each
one
presiding
over
its
destiny
and
sharing
its
vicissitudes
could
we
arm
our
eyes
with
a
microscope
and
then
dive
like
a
sparling
into
one
of
these
dunes
the
pile
which
is
in
fact
only
a
heap
of
countless
little
crystal
blocks
would
strike
us
as
the
most
marvellous
building
upon
earth
the
sunbeams
would
pass
with
illuminating
power
through
all
these
little
crystalline
bodies
we
should
see
how
every
sand
grain
is
formed
by
what
multifarious
little
facets
it
is
bounded
we
should
even
discover
that
it
is
itself
composed
of
many
distinct
particles
sand
concretions
form
within
the
dunes
and
especially
in
the
depressions
between
them
these
are
sometimes
so
extensive
and
impervious
as
to
retain
a
sufficient
supply
of
water
to
feed
perennial
springs
and
to
form
small
permanent
ponds
and
they
are
a
great
impediment
to
the
penetration
of
roots
and
consequently
to
the
growth
of
trees
planted
or
germinating
from
seeds
upon
the
dunes
structure
of
the
interior
structure
of
the
dunes
the
arrangement
of
their
particles
is
not
as
might
be
expected
that
of
an
unorganized
confused
heap
but
they
show
a
strong
tendency
to
stratification
this
is
a
point
of
much
geological
interest
because
it
indicates
that
sandstone
may
owe
its
stratified
character
to
the
action
of
wind
as
well
as
of
water
the
origin
and
peculiar
character
of
these
layers
are
due
to
a
variety
of
causes
a
southwest
wind
and
current
may
deposit
upon
a
dune
a
stratum
of
a
given
color
and
mineral
composition
and
this
may
be
succeeded
by
a
northwest
wind
and
current
bringing
with
them
particles
of
a
different
hue
constitution
and
origin
again
if
we
suppose
a
violent
tempest
to
strew
the
beach
with
sand
grains
very
different
in
magnitude
and
specific
gravity
and
after
the
sand
is
dry
to
be
succeeded
by
a
gentle
breeze
it
is
evident
that
only
the
lighter
particles
will
be
taken
up
and
carried
to
the
dunes
if
after
some
time
the
wind
freshens
heavier
grains
will
be
transported
and
deposited
on
the
former
and
a
still
stronger
succeeding
gale
will
roll
up
yet
larger
kernels
each
of
these
deposits
will
form
a
stratum
if
we
suppose
the
tempest
to
be
followed
after
the
sand
is
dry
not
by
a
gentle
breeze
but
by
a
wind
powerful
enough
to
lift
at
the
same
time
particles
of
very
various
magnitudes
and
weights
the
heaviest
will
often
lodge
on
the
dune
while
the
lighter
will
be
carried
farther
this
would
produce
a
stratum
of
coarse
sand
and
the
same
effect
might
result
from
the
blowing
away
of
light
particles
out
of
a
mixed
layer
while
the
heavier
remained
undisturbed
still
another
cause
of
stratification
may
be
found
in
the
occasional
interposition
of
a
thin
layer
of
leaves
or
other
vegetable
remains
between
successive
deposits
and
this
i
imagine
to
be
more
frequent
than
has
been
generally
supposed
the
eddies
of
strong
winds
between
the
hillocks
must
also
occasion
disturbances
and
of
the
sand
layers
and
it
seems
possible
that
the
irregular
thickness
and
the
strange
contortions
of
the
strata
of
the
sandstone
at
petra
may
be
due
to
some
such
cause
a
curious
observation
of
professor
forchhammer
suggests
an
explanation
of
another
peculiarity
in
the
structure
of
the
sandstone
of
mount
seir
he
describes
dunes
in
jutland
composed
of
yellow
quartzose
sand
intermixed
with
black
titanian
iron
when
the
wind
blows
over
the
surface
of
the
dunes
it
furrows
the
sand
with
alternate
ridges
and
depressions
ripples
in
short
like
those
of
water
the
swells
the
dividing
ridges
of
the
system
of
sand
ripples
are
composed
of
the
light
grains
of
quartz
while
the
heavier
iron
rolls
into
the
depressions
between
and
thus
the
whole
surface
of
the
dune
appears
as
if
covered
with
a
fine
black
network
of
the
sea
side
of
dunes
being
more
exposed
to
the
caprices
of
the
wind
is
more
irregular
in
form
than
the
lee
or
land
side
where
the
arrangement
of
the
particles
is
affected
by
fewer
disturbing
and
conflicting
influences
hence
the
stratification
of
the
windward
slope
is
somewhat
confused
while
the
sand
on
the
lee
side
is
found
to
be
disposed
in
more
regular
beds
inclining
landward
and
with
the
largest
particles
lowest
where
their
greater
weight
would
naturally
carry
them
the
lee
side
of
the
dunes
being
thus
formed
of
sand
deposited
according
to
the
laws
of
gravity
is
very
uniform
in
its
slope
which
according
to
forchhammer
varies
little
from
an
angle
of
with
the
horizon
while
the
more
exposed
and
irregular
weather
side
lies
at
an
inclination
of
from
to
when
however
the
outer
tier
of
dunes
is
formed
so
near
the
waterline
as
to
be
exposed
to
the
immediate
action
of
the
waves
it
is
undermined
and
the
face
of
the
hill
is
very
steep
and
sometimes
nearly
perpendicular
importance
of
these
observations
and
other
facts
which
a
more
attentive
study
on
the
spot
would
detect
might
furnish
the
means
of
determining
interesting
and
important
questions
concerning
geological
formations
in
localities
very
unlike
those
where
dunes
are
now
thrown
up
for
example
studer
supposes
that
the
drifting
sand
hills
of
the
african
desert
were
originally
coast
dunes
and
that
they
have
been
transported
to
their
present
position
far
in
the
interior
by
the
rolling
and
shifting
leeward
movement
to
which
all
dunes
not
covered
with
vegetation
are
subject
the
present
general
drift
of
the
sands
of
that
desert
appears
to
be
to
the
southwest
and
west
the
prevailing
winds
blowing
from
the
northeast
and
east
but
it
has
been
doubted
whether
the
shoals
of
the
western
coast
of
northern
africa
and
the
sands
upon
that
shore
are
derived
from
the
bottom
of
the
atlantic
in
the
usual
manner
or
by
an
inverse
process
from
those
of
the
sahara
the
latter
as
has
been
before
remarked
is
probably
the
truth
though
observations
are
wanting
to
decide
the
question
there
is
nothing
violently
improbable
in
the
supposition
that
they
may
have
been
first
thrown
up
by
the
mediterranean
on
its
libyan
coast
and
thence
blown
south
and
west
over
the
vast
space
they
now
cover
but
whatever
has
been
their
source
and
movement
they
can
hardly
fail
to
have
left
on
their
route
some
sandstone
monuments
to
mark
their
progress
such
for
example
as
we
have
seen
are
formed
from
the
dune
sand
at
the
mouth
of
the
nile
and
it
is
conceivable
that
the
character
of
the
drifting
sands
themselves
and
of
the
conglomerates
and
sandstones
to
whose
formation
they
have
contributed
might
furnish
satisfactory
evidence
as
to
their
origin
their
starting
point
and
the
course
by
which
they
have
wandered
so
far
from
the
sea
if
the
sand
of
coast
dunes
is
as
staring
describes
it
composed
chiefly
of
quartzose
grains
fragments
of
shells
and
other
constant
ingredients
it
would
often
be
recognizable
as
coast
sand
in
its
agglutinate
state
of
sandstone
the
texture
of
this
rock
varies
from
an
almost
imperceptible
fineness
of
grain
to
great
coarseness
and
affords
good
facilities
for
microscopic
observation
of
its
structure
there
are
sandstones
such
for
example
as
are
used
for
grindstones
where
the
grit
as
it
is
called
is
of
exceeding
sharpness
others
where
the
angles
of
the
grains
are
so
obtuse
that
they
scarcely
act
at
all
on
hard
metals
the
former
may
be
composed
of
grains
of
rock
disintegrated
indeed
and
recemented
together
but
not
in
the
meanwhile
much
rolled
the
latter
of
sands
long
washed
by
the
sea
and
drifted
by
land
winds
there
is
indeed
so
much
resemblance
between
the
effects
of
driving
winds
and
of
rolling
water
upon
light
bodies
that
there
would
be
difficulty
in
distinguishing
them
but
after
all
it
is
not
probable
that
sandstone
composed
of
grains
thrown
up
from
the
salt
sea
and
long
tossed
by
the
winds
would
be
identical
in
its
structure
with
that
formed
from
fragments
of
rock
crushed
by
mechanical
force
or
disintegrated
by
heat
and
again
agglutinated
without
much
exposure
to
the
action
of
moving
water
i
have
met
with
some
observations
indicating
a
structural
difference
between
interior
and
coast
dunes
which
might
perhaps
be
recognized
in
the
sandstones
formed
from
these
two
species
of
sand
hills
respectively
in
the
great
american
desert
between
the

and

falciform
shape

were
from
seven
to
fifteen

of

from
twenty
to
seventy
paces
the

of

described
as
very
small
that
of
the
concave
as
high
as

their
surfaces

no
smaller

were
observed
nor
any
in
the
process
of
formation
the
concave
side
uniformly
faced
the
northwest
except
toward
the
centre
of
the
desert
where
for
a
distance
of
one
or
two

paces
they
gradually
opened
to
the

the

firm

a
loose
base

are

shaped

from
ten
to
twenty
feet
high

have
an
acute
crest
the
inner
side
is
perpendicular
and
the
outer
or
bow
side
forms
an
angle
with
a
steep
inclination
downward
when
driven
by
violent
winds
the
medanos
pass
rapidly
over
the
plains
the
smaller
and
lighter
ones
move
quickly
forward
before
the
larger
but
the
latter
soon
overtake
and
crush
them
whilst
they
are
themselves
shivered
by
the
collision
these
medanos
assume
all
sorts
of
extraordinary
figures
and
sometimes
move
along
the
plain
in
rows
forming
most
intricate
labyrinths
a
plain
often
appears
to
be
covered
with
a
row
of
medanos
and
some
days
afterward
it
is
again
restored
to
its
level
and
uniform
aspect
the

immovable

are
formed
on
the
blocks
of
rocks
which
are
scattered
about
the

the
sand
is
driven
against
them
by
the
wind
and
as
soon
as
it
reaches
the
top

it
descends
on

it
is
difficult
to
reconcile
this
description
with
that
of
meyen
but
if
confidence
is
to
be
reposed
in
the
accuracy
of
either
observer
the
formation
of
the
sand
hills
in
question
must
be
governed
by
very
different
laws
from
those
which
determine
the
structure
of
coast
dunes
captain
gilliss
of
the
american
navy
found
the
sand
hills
of
the
peruvian
desert
to
be
in
general
crescent
shaped
as
described
by
meyen
and
a
similar
structure
is
said
to
characterize
the
inland
dunes
of
the
llano
estacado
and
other
plateaus
of
the
north
american
desert
though
these
latter
are
of
greater
height
and
other
dimensions
than
those
described
by
meyen
there
is
no
very
obvious
explanation
of
this
difference
in
form
between
maritime
and
inland
sand
hills
and
the
subject
merits
investigation
character
and
permanence
of
the
origin
of
most
great
lines
of
dunes
goes
back
past
all
history
there
are
on
many
coasts
several
distinct
ranges
of
sand
hills
which
seem
to
be
of
very
different
ages
and
to
have
been
formed
under
different
relative
conditions
of
land
and
water
in
some
cases
there
has
been
an
upheaval
of
the
coast
line
since
the
formation
of
the
oldest
hillocks
and
these
have
become
inland
dunes
while
younger
rows
have
been
thrown
up
on
the
new
beach
laid
bare
by
elevation
of
the
sea
bed
our
knowledge
of
the
mode
of
their
first
accumulation
is
derived
from
observation
of
the
action
of
wind
and
water
in
the
few
instances
where
with
or
without
the
aid
of
man
new
coast
dunes
have
been
accumulated
and
of
the
influence
of
wind
alone
in
elevating
new
sand
heaps
inland
of
the
coast
tier
when
the
outer
rows
are
destroyed
by
the
sea
as
also
when
the
sodded
surface
of
ancient
sands
has
been
broken
and
the
subjacent
strata
laid
open
to
the
air
it
is
a
question
of
much
interest
in
what
degree
the
naked
condition
of
most
dunes
is
to
be
ascribed
to
the
improvidence
and
indiscretion
of
man
there
are
in
western
france
extensive
ranges
of
dunes
covered
with
ancient
and
dense
forests
while
the
recently
formed
sand
hills
between
them
and
the
sea
are
bare
of
vegetation
and
are
rapidly
advancing
upon
the
wooded
dunes
which
they
threaten
to
bury
beneath
their
drifts
between
the
old
dunes
and
the
new
there
is
no
discoverable
difference
in
material
or
in
structure
but
the
modern
sand
hills
are
naked
and
shifting
the
ancient
clothed
with
vegetation
and
fixed
it
has
been
conjectured
that
artificial
methods
of
confinement
and
plantation
were
employed
by
the
primitive
inhabitants
of
gaul
and
laval
basing
his
calculations
on
the
rate
of
annual
movement
of
the
shifting
dunes
assigns
the
fifth
century
of
the
christian
era
as
the
period
when
these
processes
were
abandoned
there
is
no
historical
evidence
that
the
gauls
were
acquainted
with
artificial
methods
of
fixing
the
sands
of
the
coast
and
we
have
little
reason
to
suppose
that
they
were
advanced
enough
in
civilization
to
be
likely
to
resort
to
such
processes
especially
at
a
period
when
land
could
have
had
but
a
moderate
value
in
other
countries
dunes
have
spontaneously
clothed
themselves
with
forests
and
the
rapidity
with
which
their
surface
is
covered
by
various
species
of
sand
plants
and
finally
by
trees
where
man
and
cattle
and
burrowing
animals
are
excluded
from
them
renders
it
highly
probable
that
they
would
as
a
general
rule
protect
themselves
if
left
to
the
undisturbed
action
of
natural
causes
the
sand
hills
of
the
frische
nehrung
on
the
coast
of
prussia
were
formerly
wooded
down
to
the
water
edge
and
it
was
only
in
the
last
century
that
in
consequence
of
the
destruction
of
their
forests
they
became
moving
sands
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
dunes
of
the
netherlands
were
clothed
with
trees
until
after
the
roman
invasion
the
old
geographers
in
describing
these
countries
speak
of
vast
forests
extending
to
the
very
brink
of
the
sea
but
drifting
coast
dunes
are
first
mentioned
by
the
chroniclers
of
the
middle
ages
and
so
far
as
we
know
they
have
assumed
a
destructive
character
in
consequence
of
the
improvidence
of
man
the
history
of
the
dunes

michigan
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
learn
from
my
own
observation
or
that
of
others
is
the
same
thirty
years
ago
when
that
region
was
scarcely
inhabited
they
were
generally
covered
with
a
thick
growth
of
trees
chiefly
pines
and
underwood
and
there
was
little
appearance
of
undermining
and
wash
on
the

or
of
shifting
of
the

where
the
trees
had
been
cut

turned

shore
provides
with
similar
conservatism
for
the
preservation
of
the
dunes
themselves
so
that
without
the
interference
of
man
these
hillocks
would
be
not
perhaps
absolutely
perpetual
but
very
lasting
in
duration
and
very
slowly
altered
in
form
or
position
when
once
covered
with
the
trees
shrubs
and
herbaceous
growths
adapted
to
such
localities
dunes
undergo
no
apparent
change
except
the
slow
occasional
undermining
of
the
outer
tier
and
accidental
destruction
by
the
exposure
of
the
interior
from
the
burrowing
of
animals
or
the
upturning
of
trees
with
their
roots
and
all
these
causes
of
displacement
are
very
much
less
destructive
when
a
vegetable
covering
exists
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
the
breach
before
the
occupation
of
the
coasts
by
civilized
and
therefore
destructive
man
dunes
at
all
points
where
they
have
been
observed
seem
to
have
been
protected
in
their
rear
by
forests
which
served
to
break
the
force
of
the
winds
in
both
directions
and
to
have
spontaneously
clothed
themselves
with
a
dense
growth
of
the
various
plants
grasses
shrubs
and
trees
which
nature
has
assigned
to
such
soils
it
is
observed
in
europe
that
dunes
though
now
without
the
shelter
of
a
forest
country
behind
them
begin
to
protect
themselves
as
soon
as
human
trespassers
are
excluded
and
grazing
animals
denied
access
to
them
herbaceous
and
arborescent
plants
spring
up
almost
at
once
first
in
the
depressions
and
then
upon
the
surface
of
the
sand
hills
every
seed
that
sprouts
binds
together
a
certain
amount
of
sand
by
its
roots
shades
a
little
ground
with
its
leaves
and
furnishes
food
and
shelter
for
still
younger
or
smaller
growths
a
succession
of
a
very
few
favorable
seasons
suffices
to
bind
the
whole
surface
together
with
a
vegetable
network
and
the
power
of
resistance
possessed
by
the
dunes
themselves
and
the
protection
they
afford
to
the
fields
behind
them
are
just
in
proportion
to
the
abundance
and
density
of
the
plants
they
support
the
growth
of
the
vegetable
covering
can
of
course
be
much
accelerated
by
judicious
planting
and
watchful
care
and
this
species
of
improvement
is
now
carried
on
upon
a
vast
scale
wherever
the
value
of
land
is
considerable
and
the
population
dense
in
the
main
the
dunes
on
the
coast
of
the
german
sea
notwithstanding
the
great
quantity
of
often
fertile
land
they
cover
and
the
evils
which
result
from
their
movement
are
upon
the
whole
a
protective
and
beneficial
agent
and
their
maintenance
is
an
object
of
solicitude
with
the
governments
and
people
of
the
shores
they
protect
of
dunes
as
a
barrier
against
the
although
the
sea
throws
up
large
quantities
of
sand
on
flat
there
are
as
we
have
seen
many
cases
where
it
continually
encroaches
on
those
same
shores
and
washes
them
away
at
all
points
of
the
shallow
north
sea
where
the
agitation
of
the
waves
extends
to
the
bottom
banks
are
forming
and
rolling
eastward
hence
the
sea
sand
tends
to
accumulate
upon
the
coast
of
and
jutland
and
were
there
no
conflicting
influences
the
shore
would
rapidly
extend
itself
westward
but
the
same
waves
which
wash
the
sand
to
the
coast
undermine
the
beach
they
cover
and
still
more
rapidly
degrade
the
shore
at
points
where
it
is
too
high
to
receive
partial
protection
by
the
formation
of
dunes
upon
it
the
earth
of
the
coast
is
generally
composed
of
particles
finer
lighter
and
more
transportable
by
water
than
the
sea
sand
while
therefore
the
billows
raised
by
a
heavy
west
wind
may
roll
up
and
deposit
along
the
beach
thousands
of
tons
of
sand
the
same
waves
may
swallow
up
even
a
larger
quantity
of
fine
shore
earth
this
earth
with
a
portion
of
the
sand
is
swept
off
by
northwardly
and
southwardly
currents
and
let
fall
at
other
points
of
the
coast
or
carried
off
altogether
out
of
the
reach
of
causes
which
might
bring
it
back
to
its
former
position
although
then
the
eastern
shore
of
the
german
ocean
here
and
there
advances
into
the
sea
it
in
general
retreats
before
it
and
but
for
the
protection
afforded
it
by
natural
arrangements
seconded
by
the
art
and
industry
of
man
whole
provinces
would
soon
be
engulfed
by
the
waters
this
protection
consists
in
an
almost
unbroken
chain
of
sand
banks
and
dunes
extending
from
the
northernmost
point
of
jutland
to
the
elbe
a
distance
of
not
much
less
than
three
hundred
miles
and
from
the
elbe
again
though
with
more
frequent
and
wider
interruptions
to
the
atlantic
borders
of
france
and
spain
so
long
as
the
dunes
are
maintained
by
nature
or
by
human
art
they
serve
like
any
other
embankment
or
dike
as
a
partial
or
a
complete
protection
against
the
encroachments
of
the
sea
and
on
the
other
hand
when
their
drifts
are
not
checked
by
natural
processes
or
by
the
industry
of
man
they
become
a
cause
of
as
certain
if
not
of
as
sudden
destruction
as
the
ocean
itself
whose
advance
they
retard
of
the
the
eastward
progress
of
the
sea
on
the
danish
and
netherlandish
coast
and
on
certain
shores
of
the
atlantic
depends
so
much
on
local
geological
structure
on
the
force
and
direction
of
tidal
and
other
marine
currents
on
the
volume
and
rapidity
of
coast
rivers
on
the
contingencies
of
the
weather
and
on
other
varying
circumstances
that
no
general
rate
can
he
assigned
to
it
at
agger
near
the
western
end
of
the
liimfjord
in
jutland
the
coast
was
washed
away
between
the
years
and
at
the
rate
of
more
than
eighteen
feet
a
year
the
advance
of
the
sea
appears
to
have
been
something
less
rapid
for
a
century
before
but
from
to
it
gained
upon
the
land
no
less
than
thirty
feet
a
year
at
other
points
of
the
shore
of
jutland
the
loss
is
smaller
but
the
sea
is
encroaching
generally
upon
the
whole
line
of
the
coast
the
irruption
of
the
sea
into
the
lagoon
of
liimfjord
in
jutland
in
one
of
the
most
remarkable
encroachments
of
the
ocean
in
modern
times
is
expressly
ascribed
to
mismanagement
of
the
dunes
on
the
narrow
neck
of
land
which
separated
the
fjord
from
the
north
sea
at
earlier
periods
the
sea
had
swept
across
the
isthmus
and
even
burst
through
it
but
the
channel
had
been
filled
up
again
sometimes
by
artificial
means
sometimes
by
the
operation
of
natural
causes
and
on
all
these
occasions
effects
were
produced
very
similar
to
those
resulting
from
the
formation
of
the
new
channel
in
which
still
remains
open
within
comparatively
recent
historical
ages
the
liimfjord
has
thus
been
several
times
alternately
filled
with
fresh
and
with
salt
water
and
man
has
produced
by
neglecting
the
dunes
or
at
least
might
have
prevented
by
maintaining
them
changes
identical
with
those
which
are
usually
ascribed
to
the
action
of
great
geological
causes
and
sometimes
supposed
to
have
required
vast
periods
of
time
for
their
accomplishment
this
breach
says
forchhammer
which
converted
the
liimfjord
into
a
sound
and
the
northern
part
of
jutland
into
an
island
occasioned
remarkable
changes
the
first
and
most
striking
phenomenon
was
the
sudden
destruction
of
almost
all
the
fish
previously
inhabiting
this
lagoon
which
was
famous
for
its
abundant
fisheries
millions
of
fish
were
thrown
on
shore
partly
dead
and
partly
dying
and
were
carted
off
by
the
people
a
few
only
survived
and
still
frequent
the
shores
at
the
mouth
of
the
brooks
the
eel
however
has
gradually
accommodated
itself
to
the
change
of
circumstances
and
is
found
in
all
parts
of
the
fjord
while
to
all
other
fish
the
salt
water
of
the
ocean
seems
to
have
been
fatal
it
is
more
than
probable
that
the
sand
washed
in
by
the
irruption
covers
in
many
places
a
layer
of
dead
fish
and
has
thus
prepared
the
way
for
a
petrified
stratum
similar
to
those
observed
in
so
many
older
formations
as
it
seems
to
be
a
law
of
nature
that
animals
whose
life
is
suddenly
extinguished
while
yet
in
full
vigor
are
the
most
likely
to
be
preserved
by
petrification
we
find
here
one
of
the
conditions
favorable
to
the
formation
of
such
a
petrified
stratum
the
bottom
of
the
liimfjord
was
covered
with
a
vigorous
growth
of
aquatic
plants
belonging
both
to
fresh
and
to
salt
water
especially
this
vegetation
totally
disappeared
after
the
irruption
and
in
some
instances
was
buried
by
the
sand
and
here
again
we
have
a
familiar
phenomenon
often
observed
in
ancient
strata
the
indication
of
a
given
formation
by
a
particular
vegetable
species
and
when
the
strata
deposited
at
the
time
of
the
breach
shall
be
accessible
by
upheaval
the
period
of
eruption
will
be
marked
by
a
stratum
of
and
probably
by
impressions
of
fishes
it
is
very
remarkable
that
the
a
sea
plant
was
destroyed
even
where
no
sand
was
deposited
this
was
probably
in
consequence
of
the
sudden
change
from
brackish
to
salt
water
it
is
well
established
that
the
liimfjord
communicated
with
the
german
ocean
at
some
former
period
to
that
era
belong
the
deep
beds
of
oyster
shells
and
which
are
still
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
fjord
and
now
after
an
interval
of
centuries
during
which
the
lagoon
contained
no
shell
fish
it
again
produces
great
numbers
of
could
we
obtain
a
deep
section
of
the
bottom
we
should
find
beds
of
and
then
a
layer
of
with
fish
and
then
a
bed
of
if
in
course
of
time
the
new
channel
should
be
closed
the
brooks
would
fill
the
lagoon
again
with
fresh
water
fish
and
shell
fish
would
reappear
and
thus
we
should
have
a
repeated
alternation
of
organic
inhabitants
of
the
sea
and
of
the
waters
of
the
land
these
events
have
been
accompanied
with
but
a
comparatively
insignificant
change
of
land
surface
while
the
formations
in
the
bed
of
this
inland
sea
have
been
totally
revolutionized
in
character
of
holland
and
on
the
islands
on
the
coast
of
the
advance
of
the
sea
has
been
more
unequivocal
and
more
rapid
near
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
the
dunes
which
had
protected
the
western
coast
of
the
island
of
sylt
began
to
roll
to
the
east
and
the
sea
followed
closely
as
they
retired
in
the
church
of
rantum
a
village
upon
that
island
was
obliged
to
be
taken
down
in
consequence
of
the
advance
of
the
sand
hills
in
these
hills
had
passed
beyond
its
site
the
waves
had
swallowed
up
its
foundations
and
the
sea
gained
so
rapidly
that
fifty
years
later
the
spot
where
they
lay
was
seven
hundred
feet
from
the
shore
the
most
prominent
geological
landmark
on
the
coast
of
holland
is
the
huis
te
britten
a
fortress
built
by
the
romans
in
the
time
of
caligula
on
the
main
land
near
the
mouth
of
the
rhine
at
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
sea
had
advanced
sixteen
hundred
paces
beyond
it
the
older
dutch
annalists
record
with
much
parade
of
numerical
accuracy
frequent
encroachments
of
the
sea
upon
many
parts
of
the
netherlandish
coast
but
though
the
general
fact
of
an
advance
of
the
ocean
upon
the
land
is
established
beyond
dispute
the
precision
of
the
measurements
which
have
been
given
is
open
to
question
staring
however
who
thinks
the
erosion
of
the
coast
much
exaggerated
by
popular
geographers
admits
a
loss
of
more
than
a
million
and
a
half
acres
chiefly
worthless
morass
and
it
is
certain
that
but
for
the
resistance
of
man
but
for
his
erection
of
dikes
and
protection
of
dunes
there
would
now
be
left
of
holland
little
but
the
name
it
is
as
has
been
already
seen
still
a
debated
question
among
geologists
whether
the
coast
of
holland
now
is
and
for
centuries
has
been
subsiding
i
believe
most
investigators
maintain
the
affirmative
and
if
the
fact
is
so
the
advance
of
the
sea
upon
the
land
is
in
part
due
to
this
cause
but
the
rate
of
subsidence
is
at
all
events
very
small
and
therefore
the
encroachments
of
the
ocean
upon
the
coast
are
mainly
to
be
ascribed
to
the
erosion
and
transportation
of
the
soil
by
marine
waves
and
currents
the
sea
is
fast
advancing
at
several
points
of
the
western
coast
of
france
and
unknown
causes
have
given
a
new
impulse
to
its
ravages
since
the
commencement
of
the
present
century
between
and
the
point
de
grave
on
the
north
side
of
the
gironde
retreated
one
hundred
and
eighty
mètres
or
about
fifty
feet
per
year
from
the
latter
year
to
the
rate
was
increased
to
more
than
three
times
that
quantity
and
the
loss
in
those
four
years
was
above
six
hundred
feet
all
the
buildings
at
the
extremity
of
the
peninsula
have
been
taken
down
and
rebuilt
farther
landward
and
the
lighthouse
of
the
grave
now
occupies
its
third
position
the
sea
attacked
the
base
of
the
peninsula
also
and
the
point
de
grave
and
the
adjacent
coasts
have
been
for
twenty
years
the
scene
of
one
of
the
most
obstinately
contested
struggles
between
man
and
the
ocean
recorded
in
the
annals
of
modern
engineering
it
can
not
indeed
be
affirmed
that
human
power
is
able
to
arrest
altogether
the
incursions
of
the
waves
on
sandy
coasts
by
planting
the
beach
and
clothing
the
dunes
with
wood
on
the
contrary
both
in
holland
and
on
the
french
coast
it
has
been
found
necessary
to
protect
the
dunes
themselves
by
piling
and
by
piers
and
sea
walls
of
heavy
masonry
but
experience
has
amply
shown
that
the
processes
referred
to
are
entirely
successful
in
preventing
the
movement
of
the
dunes
and
the
drifting
of
their
sands
over
cultivated
lands
behind
them
and
that
at
the
same
time
the
plantations
very
much
retard
the
landward
progress
of
the
waters
of
dune
besides
their
importance
as
a
barrier
against
the
inroads
of
the
ocean
dunes
are
useful
by
sheltering
the
cultivated
ground
behind
them
from
the
violence
of
the
sea
wind
from
salt
spray
and
from
the
drifts
of
beach
sand
which
would
otherwise
overwhelm
them
but
the
dunes
themselves
unless
their
surface
sands
are
kept
moist
and
confined
by
the
growth
of
plants
or
at
least
by
a
crust
of
vegetable
earth
are
constantly
rolling
inward
and
thus
while
on
one
side
they
lay
bare
the
traces
of
ancient
human
habitations
or
other
evidences
of
the
social
life
of
primitive
man
they
are
on
the
other
burying
fields
houses
churches
and
converting
populous
districts
into
barren
and
deserted
wastes
especially
destructive
are
they
when
by
any
accident
a
cavity
is
opened
into
them
to
a
considerable
depth
thereby
giving
the
wind
access
to
the
interior
where
the
sand
is
thus
first
dried
and
then
scooped
out
and
scattered
far
over
the
neighboring
soil
the
dune
is
now
a
magazine
of
sand
no
longer
a
rampart
against
it
and
mischief
from
this
source
seems
more
difficult
to
resist
than
from
almost
any
other
drift
because
the
supply
of
material
at
the
command
of
the
wind
is
more
abundant
and
more
concentrated
than
in
its
original
thin
and
widespread
deposits
on
the
beach
the
burrowing
of
conies
in
the
dunes
is
in
this
way
not
unfrequently
a
cause
of
their
destruction
and
of
great
injury
to
the
fields
behind
them
drifts
and
even
inland
sand
hills
sometimes
result
from
breaking
the
surface
of
more
level
sand
deposits
far
within
the
range
of
the
coast
dunes
thus
we
learn
from
staring
that
one
of
the
highest
inland
dunes
in
friesland
owes
its
origin
to
the
opening
of
the
drift
sand
by
the
uprooting
of
a
large
oak
great
as
are
the
ravages
produced
by
the
encroachment
of
the
sea
upon
the
western
shores
of
continental
europe
they
have
been
in
some
degree
compensated
by
spontaneous
marine
deposits
at
other
points
of
the
coast
and
we
have
seen
in
a
former
chapter
that
the
industry
of
man
has
reclaimed
a
large
territory
from
the
bosom
of
the
ocean
these
latter
triumphs
are
not
of
recent
origin
and
the
incipient
victories
which
paved
the
way
for
them
date
back
perhaps
as
far
as
ten
centuries
in
the
mean
time
the
dunes
had
been
left
to
the

rather
freed
by
human
imprudence
from
the

with
which
nature
had
bound
them
and
it
is
scarcely
three
generations
since
man
first
attempted
to
check
their
destructive
movements
as
they
advanced
he
unresistingly
yielded
and
retreated
before
them

they
have
buried
under
their

billows
many
hundreds
of
square
miles
of
luxuriant
cornfields
and
vineyards
and
forests
of
on
the
west
coast
of
france
a
belt
of
dunes
varying
in
width
from
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
five
miles
extends
from
the
adour
to
the
estuary
of
the
gironde
and
covers
an
area
of
three
hundred
and
square
miles
when
not
fixed
by

growths
they
advance
eastward
at
a
mean
rate
of
about
one
rod
or
sixteen
and
a
half
feet
a
year
we
do
not
know
historically
when
they
began
to
drift
but
if
we
suppose
their
motion
to
have
been
always
the
same
as
at
present
they
would
have
passed
over
the
space
between
the
sea
coast
and
their
eastern
boundary
and
covered
the
large
area
above
mentioned
in
fourteen
hundred
years
we
know
from
written
records
that
they
have
buried
extensive
fields
and
forests
and
thriving
villages
and
changed
the
courses
of
rivers
and
that
the
lighter
particles
carried
from
them
by
the
winds
even
where
not
transported
in
sufficient
quantities
to
form
sand
hills
have
rendered
sterile
much
land
formerly
fertile
they
have
also
injuriously
obstructed
the
natural
drainage
of
the
maritime
districts
by
choking
up
the
beds
of
the
streams
and
forming
lakes
and
pestilential
swamps
of
no
inconsiderable
extent
in
fact
so
completely
do
they
embank
the
coast
that
between
the
gironde
and
the
village
of
mimizan
a
distance
of
one
hundred
miles
there
are
but
two
outlets
for
the
discharge
of
all
the
waters
which
flow
from
the
land
to
the
sea
and
the
eastern
front
of
the
dunes
is
bordered
by
a
succession
of
stagnant
pools
some
of
which
are
more
than
six
miles
in
length
and
breadth
dunes
of
denmark
and
in
the
small
kingdom
of
denmark
inclusive
of
the
duchies
of
schleswig
and
holstein
the
dunes
cover
an
area
of
more
than
two
hundred
and
sixty
square
miles
the
breadth
of
the
chain
is
very
various
and
in
some
places
it
consists
only
of
a
single
row
of
sand
hills
while
in
others
it
is
more
than
six
miles
wide
the
general
rate
of
eastward
movement
of
the
drifting
dunes
is
from
three
to
feet
per
annum
if
we
adopt
the
mean
of
thirteen
feet
and
a
half
for
the
annual
motion
the
dunes
have
traversed
the
widest
part
of
the
belt
in
about
hundred
years
historical
data
are
wanting
as
to
the
period
of
the
formation
of
these
dunes
and
of
the
commencement
of
their
drifting
but
there
is
recorded
evidence
that
they
have
buried
a
vast
extent
of
valuable
land
within
three
or
four
centuries
and
further
proof
is
found
in
the
fact
that
the
movement
of
the
sands
is
constantly
uncovering
ruins
of
ancient
buildings
and
other
evidences
of
human
occupation
at
points
far
within
the
present
limits
of
the
uninhabitable
desert
andresen
estimates
the
average
depth
of
the
sand
deposited
over
this
area
at
thirty
feet
which
would
give
a
cubic
mile
and
a
half
for
the
total
quantity
the
drifting
of
the
dunes
on
the
coast
of
prussia
commenced
not
much
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
the
frische
nehrung
is
separated
from
the
mainland
by
the
frische
haff
and
there
is
but
a
narrow
strip
of
arable
land
along
its
eastern
borders
hence
its
rolling
sands
have
covered
a
comparatively
small
extent
of
dry
land
but
fields
and
villages
have
been
buried
and
valuable
forests
laid
waste
by
them
the
loose
coast
row
has
drifted
over
the
inland
ranges
which
as
was
noticed
in
the
description
of
these
dunes
on
a
former
page
were
protected
by
a
surface
of
different
composition
and
the
sand
has
thus
been
raised
to
a
height
which
it
could
not
have
reached
upon
level
ground
this
elevation
has
enabled
it
to
advance
upon
and
overwhelm
woods
which
upon
a
plain
would
have
checked
its
progress
and
in
one
instance
a
forest
of
many
hundred
acres
of
tall
pines
was
destroyed
by
the
drifts
between
and
of
dunes
by
there
are
three
principal
modes
in
which
the
industry
of
man
is
brought
to
bear
upon
the
dunes
first
the
creation
of
them
at
points
where
from
changes
in
the
currents
or
other
causes
new
encroachments
of
the
sea
are
threatened
second
the
maintenance
and
protection
of
them
where
they
have
been
naturally
formed
and
third
the
removal
of
the
inner
rows
where
the
belt
is
so
broad
that
no
danger
is
to
be
apprehended
from
the
loss
of
them
formation
of
in
describing
the
natural
formation
of
dunes
it
was
said
that
they
began
with
an
accumulation
of
sand
around
some
vegetable
or
other
accidental
obstruction
to
the
drifting
of
the
particles
a
high
perpendicular
cliff
which
deadens
the
wind
altogether
prevents
all
accumulation
of
sand
but
up
to
a
certain
point
the
higher
and
broader
the
obstruction
the
more
sand
will
heap
up
in
front
of
it
and
the
more
will
that
which
falls
behind
it
be
protected
from
drifting
farther
this
familiar
observation
has
taught
the
inhabitants
of
the
coast
that
an
artificial
wall
or
dike
will
in
many
situations
give
rise
to
a
broad
belt
of
dunes
thus
a
sand
dike
or
wall
of
three
or
four
miles
in
length
thrown
in
across
the
koegras
a
flat
between
the
zuiderzee
and
the
north
sea
has
occasioned
the
formation
of
rows
of
dunes
a
mile
in
breadth
and
thus
excluded
the
sea
altogether
from
the
koegras
a
similar
dike
called
the
zijperzeedijk
has
produced
another
scarcely
less
extensive
belt
in
the
course
of
two
centuries
a
few
years
since
the
sea
was
threatening
to
cut
through
the
island
of
ameland
and
by
encroachment
on
the
southern
side
and
the
blowing
off
of
the
sand
from
a
low
flat
which
connected
the
two
higher
parts
of
the
island
it
had
made
such
progress
that
in
heavy
storms
the
waves
sometimes
rolled
quite
across
the
isthmus
the
construction
of
a
breakwater
and
a
sand
dike
have
already
checked
the
advance
of
the
sea
and
a
large
number
of
sand
hills
has
been
formed
the
rapid
growth
of
which
promises
complete
future
security
against
both
wind
and
wave
similar
effects
have
been
produced
by
the
erection
of
plank
fences
and
even
of
simple
screens
of
wattling
and
reeds
of
the
dunes
of
holland
are
sometimes
protected
from
the
dashing
of
the
waves
by
a
of
stone
or
by
piles
and
the
lateral
currents
which
wash
away
their
base
are
occasionally
checked
by
transverse
walls
running
from
the
foot
of
the
dunes
to
mark
but
the
great
expense
of
such
constructions
has
prevented
their
adoption
on
a
large
scale
the
principal
means
relied
on
for
the
protection
of
the
sand
hills
are
the
planting
of
their
surfaces
and
the
exclusion
of
burrowing
and
grazing
animals
there
are
grasses
creeping
plants
and
shrubs
of
spontaneous
growth
which
flourish
in
loose
sand
and
if
protected
spread
over
considerable
tracts
and
finally
convert
their
face
into
a
soil
capable
of
cultivation
or
at
least
of
producing
forest
trees
krause
enumerates
one
hundred
and
plants
as
native
to
the
coast
sands
of
prussia
and
the
observations
of
andresen
in
jutland
carry
the
number
of
these
vegetables
up
to
two
hundred
and
some
of
these
plants

gourbet
in
french
and
marram
in
english
are
exclusively
confined
to
sandy
soils
and
thrive
well
only
in
a
saline
atmosphere
the
arundo
grows
to
the
height
of
about
inches
but
sends
its
strong
roots
with
their
many
rootlets
to
a
distance
of
forty
or
fifty
feet
it
has
the
peculiar
property
of
nourishing
best
in
the
loosest
soil
and
a
sand
shower
seems
to
refresh
it
as
the
rain
revives
the
thirsty
plants
of
the
common
earth
its
roots
bind
together
the
dunes
and
its
leaves
protect
their
surface
when
the
sand
ceases
to
drift
the
arundo
dies
its
decaying
roots
fertilizing
the
sand
and
the
decomposition
of
its
leaves
forming
a
layer
of
vegetable
earth
over
it
then
follows
a
succession
of
other
plants
which
gradually
fit
the
sand
hills
by
growth
and
decay
for
forest
planting
for
pasturage
and
sometimes
for
ordinary
agricultural
use
but
the
protection
and
gradual
transformation
of
the
dunes
is
not
the
only
service
rendered
by
this
valuable
plant
its
leaves
are
nutritious
food
for
sheep
and
cattle
its
seeds
for
poultry
cordage
and
netting
twine
are
manufactured
from
its
fibres
it
makes
a
good
material
for
thatching
and
its
dried
roots
furnish
excellent
fuel
these
useful
qualities
unfortunately
are
too
often
prejudicial
to
its
growth
the
peasants
feed
it
down
with
their
cattle
cut
it
for
rope
making
or
dig
it
up
for
fuel
and
it
has
been
found
necessary
to
resort
to
severe
legislation
to
prevent
them
from
bringing
ruin
upon
themselves
by
thus
improvidently
sacrificing
their
most
effectual
safeguard
against
the
drifting
of
the
sands
in
a
decree
of
christian
iii
king
of
denmark
imposed
a
fine
upon
persons
convicted
of
destroying
certain
species
of
sand
plants
upon
the
west
coast
of
jutland
this
ordinance
was
renewed
and
made
more
comprehensive
in
and
in
the
inhabitants
of
several
districts
were
required
by
royal
rescript
to
do
their
best
to
check
the
sand
drifts
though
the
specific
measures
to
be
adopted
for
that
purpose
are
not
indicated
various
laws
against
stripping
the
dunes
of
their
vegetation
were
enacted
in
the
following
century
but
no
active
measures
were
taken
for
the
subjugation
of
the
sand
drifts
until
when
a
preliminary
system
of
operation
for
that
purpose
was
adopted
this
consisted
in
little
more
than
the
planting
of
the
and
other
sand
plants
and
the
exclusion
of
animals
destructive
to
these
vegetables
ten
years
later
plantations
of
forest
trees
which
have
since
proved
so
valuable
a
means
of
fixing
the
dunes
and
rendering
them
productive
were
commenced
and
have
been
continued
ever
since
during
this
latter
period
brémontier
without
any
knowledge
of
what
was
doing
in
denmark
experimented
upon
the
cultivation
of
forest
trees
on
the
dunes
of
gascony
and
perfected
a
system
which
with
some
improvements
in
matters
of
detail
is
still
largely
pursued
on
those
shores
the
example
of
denmark
was
soon
followed
in
the
neighboring
kingdom
of
prussia
and
in
the
netherlands
and
as
we
shall
see
hereafter
these
improvements
have
been
everywhere
crowned
with
most
flattering
success
under
the
administration
of
reventlov
a
little
before
the
close
of
the
last
century
the
danish
government
organized
a
regular
system
of
improvement
in
the
economy
of
the
dunes
they
were
planted
with
the
arundo
and
other
vegetables
of
similar
habits
protected
against
trespassers
and
at
last
partly
covered
with
forest
trees
by
these
means
much
waste
soil
has
been
converted
into
arable
ground
a
large
growth
of
valuable
timber
obtained
and
the
further
spread
of
the
drifts
which
threatened
to
lay
waste
the
whole
peninsula
of
jutland
to
a
considerable
extent
arrested
in
france
the
operations
for
fixing
and
reclaiming
the
dunes
which
began
under
the
direction
of
brémontier
about
the
same
time
as
in
denmark
and
which
are
in
principle
and
in
many
of
their
details
similar
to
those
employed
in
the
latter
kingdom
have
been
conducted
on
a
far
larger
scale
and
with
greater
success
than
in
any
other
country
this
is
partly
owing
to
a
climate
more
favorable
to
the
growth
of
suitable
forest
trees
than
that
of
northern
europe
and
partly
to
the
liberality
of
the
government
which
having
more
important
landed
interests
to
protect
has
put
larger
means
at
the
disposal
of
the
engineers
than
denmark
and
prussia
have
found
it
convenient
to
appropriate
to
that
purpose
the
area
of
the
dunes
already
secured
from
drifting
and
planted
by
the
processes
invented
by
brémontier
and
perfected
by
his
successors
is
about
acres
this
amount
of
productive
soil
then
has
been
added
to
the
resources
of
france
and
a
still
greater
quantity
of
valuable
land
has
been
thereby
rescued
from
the
otherwise
certain
destruction
with
which
it
was
threatened
by
the
advance
of
the
rolling
sand
hills
the
improvements
of
the
dunes
on
the
coast
of
west
prussia
began
in
under
sören
björn
a
native
of
denmark
and
with
the
exception
of
the
ten
years
between
and
they
have
been
prosecuted
ever
since
the
methods
do
not
differ
essentially
from
those
employed
in
denmark
and
france
though
they
are
modified
by
local
circumstances
and
with
respect
to
the
trees
selected
for
planting
by
climate
in
between
the
mouth
of
the
vistula
and
kahlberg
acres
including
about
acres
planted
with
pines
and
birches
had
been
secured
from
drifting
between
kahlberg
and
the
eastern
boundary
of
acres
and
important
preliminary
operations
had
been
carried
on
for
subduing
the
dunes
on
the
west
coast
suited
to
dune
the
tree
which
has
been
found
to
thrive
best
upon
the
sand
hills
of
the
french
coast
and
at
the
same
time
to
confine
the
sand
most
firmly
and
yield
the
largest
pecuniary
returns
is
the
maritime
pine
a
species
valuable
both
for
its
timber
and
for
its
resinous
products
it
is
always
grown
from
seed
and
the
young
shoots
require
to
be
protected
for
several
seasons
by
the
branches
of
other
trees
planted
in
rows
or
spread
over
the
surface
and
staked
down
by
the
growth
of
the
and
other
small
sand
plants
or
by
wattled
hedges
the
beach
from
which
the
sand
is
derived
has
been
generally
planted
with
the
arundo
because
the
pine
does
not
thrive
well
so
near
the
sea
but
it
is
thought
that
a
species
of
tamarisk
is
likely
to
succeed
in
that
latitude
even
better
than
the
arundo
the
shade
and
the
protection
offered
by
the
branching
top
of
this
pine
are
favorable
to
the
growth
of
deciduous
trees
and
while
still
young
of
shrubs
and
smaller
plants
which
contribute
more
rapidly
to
the
formation
of
vegetable
mould
and
thus
when
the
pine
has
once
taken
root
the
redemption
of
the
waste
is
considered
as
effectually
secured
in
france
the
maritime
pine
is
planted
on
the
sands
of
the
interior
as
well
as
on
the
dunes
of
the
sea
coast
and
with
equal
advantage
this
tree
resembles
the
pitch
pine
of
the
southern
american
states
in
its
habits
and
is
applied
to
the
same
uses
the
extraction
of
turpentine
from
it
begins
at
the
age
of
about
twenty
years
or
when
it
has
attained
a
diameter
of
from
nine
to
twelve
inches
incisions
are
made
up
and
down
the
trunk
to
the
depth
of
about
half
an
inch
in
the
wood
and
it
is
insisted
that
if
not
more
than
two
such
slits
are
cut
the
tree
is
not
sensibly
injured
by
the
process
the
growth
indeed
is
somewhat
checked
but
the
wood
becomes
superior
to
that
of
trees
from
which
the
turpentine
is
not
extracted
thus
treated
the
pine
continues
to
flourish
to
the
age
of
one
hundred
or
one
hundred
and
twenty
years
and
up
to
this
age
the
trees
on
a
hectare
yield
annually
kilogrammes
of
essence
of
turpentine
and
kilogrammes
of
resin
worth
together
francs
the
expense
of
extraction
and
distillation
is
calculated
at
francs
and
a
clear
profit
of
francs
per
hectare
or
more
than
five
dollars
per
acre
is
left
this
is
exclusive
of
the
value
of
the
timber
when
finally
cut
which
of
course
amounts
to
a
very
considerable
sum
in
denmark
where
the
climate
is
much
colder
hardier
conifers
as
well
as
the
birch
and
other
northern
trees
are
found
to
answer
a
better
purpose
than
the
maritime
pine
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
this
tree
would
be
able
to
resist
the
winter
on
the
dunes
of
massachusetts
probably
the
pitch
pine
of
the
northern
states
in
conjunction
with
some
of
the
american
oaks
birches
and
poplars
and
especially
the
robinia
or
locust
would
prove
very
suitable
to
be
employed
on
the
sand
hills
of
cape
cod
and
long
island
the
ailanthus
now
coming
into
notice
as
a
tree
may
perhaps
serve
a
better
purpose
than
any
of
them
of
dunes
in
the
dunes
of
denmark
as
we
have
seen
cover
an
area
of
two
hundred
and
sixty
square
miles
or
one
hundred
and
thousand
acres
those
of
the
prussian
coast
are
vaguely
estimated
at
from
to
one
hundred
and
ten
thousand
acres
those
of
holland
at
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
acres
those
of
gascony
at
about
three
hundred
thousand
acres
i
do
not
find
any
estimate
of
their
extent
in
other
provinces
of
france
in
the
duchies
of
schleswig
and
holstein
or
in
the
baltic
provinces
of
russia
but
it
is
probable
that
the
entire
quantity
of
dune
land
upon
the
eastern
shores
of
the
atlantic
and
the
baltic
does
not
fall
much
short
of
a
million
of
acres
this
vast
deposit
of
sea
sand
extends
along
the
coast
for
a
distance
of
several
hundred
miles
and
from
the
time
of
the
destruction
of
the
forests
which
covered
it
to
the
year
the
whole
line
was
rolling
inward
and
burying
the
soil
beneath
it
or
rendering
the
fields
unproductive
by
the
sand
which
drifted
from
it
at
the
same
time
as
the
sand
hills
moved
eastward
the
ocean
was
closely
following
their
retreat
and
swallowing
up
the
ground
they
had
covered
as
fast
as
their
movement
left
it
bare
planting
the
dunes
has
completely
prevented
the
surface
sands
from
blowing
over
the
soil
to
the
leeward
of
the
plantations
and
though
it
has
not
in
all
cases
arrested
the
encroachments
of
the
sea
it
has
so
greatly
retarded
the
rapidity
of
their
advance
that
sandy
coasts
when
once
covered
with
forests
may
be
considered
as
substantially
secure
so
long
as
proper
measures
are
taken
for
the
protection
of
the
woods
vineyards
of
cap
in
the
vicinity
of
cap
breton
in
france
a
peculiar
process
is
successfully
employed
both
for
preventing
the
drifting
of
dunes
and
for
rendering
the
sands
themselves
immediately
productive
but
this
method
is
applicable
only
in
exceptional
cases
of
favorable
climate
and
exposure
it
consists
in
planting
vineyards
upon
the
dunes
and
protecting
them
by
hedges
of
broom
so
disposed
as
to
form
rectangles
about
thirty
feet
by
forty
the
vines
planted
in
these
enclosures
thrive
admirably
and
the
grapes
produced
by
them
are
among
the
best
grown
in
france
the
dunes
are
so
far
from
being
an
unfavorable
soil
for
the
vine
that
fresh
is
regularly
employed
as
a
fertilizer
for
it
alternating
every
other
season
with
ordinary
manure
the
quantity
of
sand
thus
applied
every
second
year
raises
the
surface
of
the
vineyard
about
four
or
five
inches
the
vines
are
cut
down
every
year
to
three
or
four
shoots
and
the
raising
of
the
soil
rapidly
covers
the
old
stocks
as
fast
as
buried
they
send
out
new
roots
near
the
surface
and
thus
the
vineyard
is
constantly
renewed
and
has
always
a
youthful
appearance
though
it
may
have
been
already
planted
a
couple
of
generations
this
practice
is
ascertained
to
have
been
followed
for
two
centuries
and
is
among
the
oldest
attempts
of
man
to
resist
and
vanquish
the
dunes
of
the
artificial
removal
of
dunes
no
longer
necessary
as
a
protection
does
not
appear
to
have
been
practised
upon
a
large
scale
except
in
the
netherlands
where
the
numerous
canals
furnish
an
easy
and
economical
means
of
transporting
the
sand
and
where
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
sea
and
river
dikes
and
of
causeways
and
other
embankments
and
fillings
create
a
great
demand
for
that
material
sand
is
also
employed
in
holland
in
large
quantities
for
improving
the
consistence
of
the
tough
clay
bordering
upon
or
underlying
diluvial
deposits
and
for
forming
an
artificial
soil
for
the
growth
of
certain
garden
and
ornamental
vegetables
when
the
dunes
are
removed
the
ground
they
covered
is
restored
to
the
domain
of
industry
and
the
quantity
of
land
recovered
in
the
netherlands
by
the
removal
of
the
barren
sands
which
encumbered
it
amounts
to
hundreds
and
perhaps
thousands
of
acres
sand
the
inland
sand
plains
of
europe
are
either
derived
from
the
drifting
of
dunes
or
other
beach
sands
or
consist
of
diluvial
deposits
as
we
have
seen
when
once
the
interior
of
a
dune
is
laid
open
to
the
wind
its
contents
are
soon
scattered
far
and
wide
over
the
adjacent
country
and
the
beach
sands
no
longer
checked
by
the
rampart
which
nature
had
constrained
them
to
build
against
their
own
encroachments
are
also
carried
to
considerable
distances
from
the
coast
few
regions
have
suffered
so
much
from
this
cause
in
proportion
to
their
extent
as
the
peninsula
of
jutland
so
long
as
the
woods
with
which
nature
had
planted
the
danish
dunes
were
spared
they
seem
to
have
been
stationary
and
we
have
no
historical
evidence
of
an
earlier
date
than
the
sixteenth
century
that
they
had
become
in
any
way
injurious
from
that
period
there
are
frequent
notices
of
the
invasions
of
cultivated
grounds
by
the
sands
and
excavations
are
constantly
bringing
to
light
proof
of
human
habitation
and
of
agricultural
industry
in
former
ages
on
soils
now
buried
beneath
deep
drifts
from
the
dunes
and
beaches
of
the
sea
coast
extensive
tracts
of
valuable
plain
land
in
the
netherlands
and
in
france
have
been
covered
in
the
same
way
with
a
layer
of
sand
deep
enough
to
render
them
infertile
and
they
can
be
restored
to
cultivation
only
by
processes
analogous
to
those
employed
for
fixing
and
improving
the
dunes
diluvial
sand
plains
also
have
been
reclaimed
by
these
methods
in
the
duchy
of
austria
between
vienna
and
the
semmering
ridge
in
jutland
and
in
the
great
champaign
country
of
northern
germany
especially
the
mark
brandenburg
where
artificial
forests
can
be
propagated
with
great
ease
and
where
consequently
this
branch
of
industry
has
been
pursued
on
a
great
scale
and
with
highly
beneficial
results
both
as
respects
the
supply
of
forest
products
and
the
preparation
of
the
soil
for
agricultural
use
as
a
general
rule
inland
sands
are
looser
dryer
and
more
inclined
to
drift
than
those
of
the
sea
coast
where
the
moist
and
saline
atmosphere
of
the
ocean
keeps
them
always
more
or
less
humid
and
cohesive
no
shore
dunes
are
so
movable
as
the
medanos
of
peru
described
in
a
passage
quoted
from
pöppig
on
a
former
page
or
as
the
sand
hills
of
poland
both
of
which
seem
better
entitled
to
the
appellation
of
sand
waves
than
those
of
the
sahara
or
of
the
arabian
desert
the
sands
of
the
valley
of
the
lower
euphrates
themselves
probably
of
submarine
origin
and
not
derived
from
dunes
are
advancing
to
the
northwest
with
a
rapidity
which
seems
fabulous
when
compared
with
the
slow
movement
of
the
sand
hills
of
gascony
and
the
low
german
coasts
loftus
speaking
of
niliyya
an
old
arab
town
a
few
miles
east
of
the
ruins
of
babylon
says
that
in
the
sand
began
to
accumulate
around
it
and
in
six
years
the
desert
within
a
radius
of
six
miles
was
covered
with
little
undulating
domes
while
the
ruins
of
the
city
were
so
buried
that
it
is
now
impossible
to
trace
their
original
form
or
extent
loftus
considers
this
sand
flood
as
the
vanguard
of
those
vast
drifts
which
advancing
from
the
southeast
threaten
eventually
to
overwhelm
babylon
and
baghdad
an
observation
of
layard
cited
by
loftus
appears
to
me
to
furnish
a
possible
explanation
of
this
irruption
he
passed
two
or
three
places
where
the
sand
issuing
from
the
earth
like
water
is
called
sand
springs
these
springs
are
very
probably
merely
the
drifting
of
sand
from
the
ancient
subsoil
where
the
protecting
crust
of
aquatic
deposit
and
vegetable
earth
has
been
broken
through
as
in
the
case
of
the
drift
which
arose
from
the
upturning
of
an
oak
mentioned
on
a
former
page
when
the
valley
of
the
euphrates
was
regularly
irrigated
and
cultivated
the
underlying
sands
were
bound
by
moisture
alluvial
slime
and
vegetation
but
now
that
all
improvement
is
neglected
and
the
surface
no
longer
watered
has
become
parched
powdery
and
naked
a
mere
accidental
fissure
in
the
superficial
stratum
may
soon
be
enlarged
to
a
wide
opening
that
will
let
loose
sand
enough
to
overwhelm
a
province
landes
of
the
most
remarkable
sand
plain
of
france
lies
at
the
southwestern
extremity
of
the
empire
and
is
generally
known
as
the
landes
or
heaths
of
gascony
clavé
thus
describes
it
composed
of
pure
sand
resting
on
an
impermeable
stratum
called
the
soil
of
the
landes
was
for
centuries
considered
incapable
of
cultivation
parched
in
summer
drowned
in
winter
it
produced
only
ferns
rushes
and
heath
and
scarcely
furnished
pasturage
for
a
few
flocks
to
crown
its
miseries
this
plain
was
continually
threatened
by
the
encroachments
of
the
dunes
vast
ridges
of
sand
thrown
up
by
the
waves
for
a
distance
of
more
than
fifty
leagues
along
the
coast
and
continually
renewed
were
driven
inland
by
the
west
wind
and
as
they
rolled
over
the
plain
they
buried
the
soil
and
the
hamlets
overcame
all
resistance
and
advanced
with
fearful
regularity
the
whole
province
seemed
devoted
to
certain
destruction
when
brémontier
invented
his
method
of
fixing
the
dunes
by
plantations
of
the
maritime
pine
although
the
landes
had
been
almost
abandoned
for
ages
they
show
numerous
traces
of
ancient
cultivation
and
prosperity
and
it
is
principally
by
means
of
the
encroachments
of
the
sands
that
they
have
become
reduced
to
their
present
desolate
condition
the
destruction
of
the
coast
towns
and
harbors
which
furnished
markets
for
the
products
of
the
plains
the
damming
up
of
the
rivers
and
the
obstruction
of
the
smaller
channels
of
natural
drainage
by
the
advance
of
the
dunes
were
no
doubt
very
influential
causes
and
if
we
add
the
drifting
of
the
sea
sand
over
the
soil
we
have
at
least
a
partial
explanation
of
the
decayed
agriculture
and
diminished
population
of
this
great
waste
when
the
dunes
were
once
arrested
and
the
soil
to
the
east
of
them
was
felt
to
be
secure
against
invasion
by
them
experiments
in
the
way
of
agricultural
improvement
by
drainage
and
plantation
were
commenced
and
they
have
been
attended
with
such
signal
success
that
the
complete
recovery
of
one
of
the
dreariest
and
most
extensive
wastes
in
europe
may
be
considered
as
both
a
probable
and
a
near
event
belgian
in
the
northern
part
of
belgium
and
extending
across
the
confines
of
holland
is
another
very
similar
heath
plain
called
the
campine
this
is
a
vast
sand
flat
interspersed
with
marshes
and
inland
dunes
and
until
recently
considered
wholly
incapable
of
cultivation
enormous
sums
have
been
expended
in
reclaiming
it
by
draining
and
other
familiar
agricultural
processes
but
without
results
at
all
proportional
to
the
capital
invested
in
the
unimproved
portion
of
the
campine
was
estimated
at
little
less
than
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
acres
the
example
of
france
has
prompted
experiments
in
the
planting
of
trees
especially
the
maritime
pine
upon
this
barren
waste
and
the
results
have
been
such
as
to
show
that
its
sands
may
both
be
fixed
and
made
productive
not
only
without
loss
but
with
positive
pecuniary
advantage
and
steppes
of
eastern
there
are
still
unsubdued
sand
wastes
in
many
parts
of
interior
europe
not
familiarly
known
to
tourists
or
even
geographers
olkuez
and
schiewier
in
poland
says
naumann
lie
in
true
sand
deserts
and
a
boundless
plain
of
sand
stretches
around
ozenstockau
on
which
there
grows
neither
tree
nor
shrub
in
heavy
winds
this
plain
resembles
a
rolling
sea
and
the
sand
hills
rise
and
disappear
like
the
waves
of
the
ocean
the
heaps
of
waste
from
the
olkuez
mines
are
covered
with
sand
to
the
depth
of
four
fathoms
no
attempts
have
yet
been
made
to
subdue
the
sands
of
poland
but
when
peace
and
prosperity
shall
be
restored
to
that
unhappy
country
there
is
no
reasonable
doubt
that
the
measures
which
have
proved
so
successful
on
similar
formations
in
germany
may
be
employed
with
advantage
in
the
polish
deserts
there
are
sand
drifts
in
parts
of
the
steppes
of
russia
but
in
general
the
soil
of
those
vast
plains
is
of
a
different
though
very
varied
composition
and
is
covered
with
vegetation
the
steppes
however
have
many
points
of
analogy
with
the
sand
plains
of
northern
germany
and
if
they
are
ever
fitted
for
civilized
occupation
it
must
be
by
the
same
means
that
is
by
planting
forests
it
is
disputed
whether
the
steppes
were
ever
wooded
they
were
certainly
bare
of
forest
growth
at
a
very
remote
period
for
herodotus
describes
the
country
of
the
scythians
between
the
ister
and
the
tanais
as
woodless
with
the
exception
of
the
small
province
of
xylæa
between
the
dnieper
and
the
gulf
of
perekop
they
are
known
to
have
been
occupied
by
a
large
nomade
and
pastoral
population
down
to
the
sixteenth
century
though
these
tribes
are
now
much
reduced
in
numbers
the
habits
of
such
races
are
scarcely
less
destructive
to
the
forest
than
those
of
civilized
life
pastoral
tribes
do
not
employ
much
wood
for
fuel
or
for
construction
but
they
carelessly
or
recklessly
burn
down
the
forests
and
their
cattle
effectually
check
the
growth
of
young
trees
wherever
their
range
extends
at
present
the
furious
winds
which
sweep
over
the
plains
the
droughts
of
summer
and
the
rights
and
abuses
of
pasturage
constitute
very
formidable
obstacles
to
the
employment
of
measures
which
have
been
attended
with
so
valuable
results
on
the
sand
wastes
of
france
and
germany
the
russian
government
has
however
attempted
the
wooding
of
the
steppes
and
there
are
thriving
plantations
in
the
neighborhood
of
odessa
where
the
soil
is
of
a
particularly
loose
and
sandy
character
the
trees
best
suited
to
this
locality
and
as
there
is
good
reason
to
suppose
to
sand
plains
in
general
is
the
or
japan
varnish
tree
the
remarkable
success
which
has
crowned
the
experiments
with
the
ailanthus
at
odessa
will
no
doubt
stimulate
to
similar
trials
elsewhere
and
it
seems
not
improbable
that
the
arundo
and
the
maritime
pine
which
have
fixed
so
many
thousand
acres
of
drifting
sands
in
western
europe
will
be
partially
at
least
superseded
by
the
tamarisk
and
the
varnish
tree
of
reclaiming
the
if
we
consider
the
quantity
of
waste
land
which
has
been
made
productive
by
the
planting
of
the
sand
hills
and
plains
and
the
extent
of
fertile
soil
the
number
of
villages
and
other
human
improvements
and
the
value
of
the
harbors
which
the
same
process
has
saved
from
being
buried
under
the
rolling
dunes
and
at
last
swallowed
up
forever
by
the
invasions
of
the
sea
we
shall
be
inclined
to
rank
brémontier
and
reventlov
among
the
greatest
benefactors
of
their
race
with
the
exception
of
the
dikes
of
the
netherlands
their
labors
are
the
first
deliberate
and
direct
attempts
of
man
to
make
himself
on
a
great
scale
a
geographical
power
to
restore
natural
balances
which
earlier
generations
had
disturbed
and
to
atone
by
acts
guided
by
foreseeing
and
settled
purpose
for
the
waste
which
thoughtless
improvidence
had
created
there
is
an
important
political
difference
between
these
latter
works
and
the
diking
system
of
the
netherlandish
and
german
coasts
the
dikes
originally
were
and
in
modern
times
very
generally
have
been
private
enterprises
undertaken
with
no
other
aim
than
to
add
a
certain
quantity
of
cultivable
soil
to
the
former
possessions
of
their
proprietor
or
sometimes
of
the
state
in
short
with
few
exceptions
they
have
been
merely
a
pecuniary
investment
a
mode
of
acquiring
land
not
economically
different
from
purchase
the
planting
of
the
dunes
on
the
contrary
has
always
been
a
public
work
executed
not
with
the
expectation
of
reaping
a
regular
direct
percentage
of
income
from
the
expenditure
but
dictated
by
higher
views
of
state
economy
by
the
same
governmental
principles
in
fact
which
animate
all
commonwealths
in
repelling
invasion
by

have
been

in
ancient

times
the
execution
of
which
would
produce
considerable
and
in
some
cases
extremely
important
revolutions
in

of

some
of
the
schemes
to
which
i
refer
are
evidently
chimerical
others
are
difficult
indeed
but
can
not
be
said
to
be
impracticable
though
discouraged
by
the
apprehension
of
disastrous
consequences
from
the
disturbance
of
existing
natural
or

arrangements
and
there
are
still
others
the
accomplishment
of
which
is
ultimately
certain
though
for
the
present
forbidden
by
economical
considerations
when
we
consider
the
number
of
narrow
necks
or
isthmuses
which
separate
gulfs
and
bays
of
the
sea
from
each
other
or
from
the
main
ocean
and
take
into
account
the
time
and
cost
and
risks
of
navigation
which
would
be
saved
by
executing
channels
to
connect
such
waters
and
thus
avoiding
the
necessity
of
doubling
long
capes
and
promontories
or
even
continents
it
seems
strange
that
more
of
the
enterprise
and
money
which
have
been
so
lavishly
expended
in
forming
artificial
rivers
for
internal
navigation
should
not
have
been
bestowed
upon
the
construction
of
maritime
canals
many
such
have
been
projected
in
early
and
in
recent
ages
and
some
trifling
cuts
between
marine
waters
have
been
actually
made
but
no
work
of
this
sort
possessing
real
geographical
or
even
commercial
importance
has
yet
been
effected
these
enterprises
are
attended
with
difficulties
and
open
to
objections
which
are
not
at
first
sight
obvious
nature
guards
well
the
chains
by
which
she
connects

with

and
binds

together
isthmuses
are
usually
composed
of
adamantine
rock
or
of
shifting
sands
the
latter
being
much
the
more
refractory
material
to
deal
with
in
all
such
works
there
is
a
necessity
for
deep
excavation
below
mark
always
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
the
dimensions
of
channels
for
ships
must
be
much
greater
than
those
of
canals
of
inland
navigation
the
height
of
the
masts
or
smoke
pipes
of
that
class
of
vessels
would
often
render
bridging
impossible
and
thus
a
ship
canal
might
obstruct
a
communication
more
important
than
that
which
it
was
intended
to
promote
the
securing
of
the
entrances
of
marine
canals
and
the
construction
of
ports
at
their
termini
would
in
general
be
difficult
and
expensive
and
the
harbors
and
the
channel
which
connected
them
would
be
extremely
liable
to
fill
up
by
deposits
washed
in
from
sea
and
shore
besides
all
this
there
is
in
many
cases
an
alarming
uncertainty
as
to
the
effects
of
joining
together
waters
which
nature
has
put
asunder
a
new
channel
may
deflect
strong
currents
from
safe
courses
and
thus
occasion
destructive
erosion
of
shores
otherwise
secure
or
promote
the
transportation
of
sand
or
slime
to
block
up
important
harbors
or
it
may
furnish
a
powerful
enemy
with
dangerous
facilities
for
hostile
operations
along
the
coast
nature
sometimes
mocks
the
cunning
and
the
power
of
man
by
spontaneously
performing
for
his
benefit
works
which
he
shrinks
from
undertaking
and
the
execution
of
which
by
him
she
would
resist
with
unconquerable
obstinacy
a
dangerous
sand
bank
that
all
the
enginery
of
the
world
could
not
dredge
out
in
a
generation
may
be
carried
off
in
a
night
by
a
strong
river
flood
or
a
current
impelled
by
a
violent
wind
from
an
unusual
quarter
and
a
passage
scarcely
navigable
by
fishing
boats
may
be
thus
converted
into
a
commodious
channel
for
the
largest
ship
that
floats
upon
the
ocean
in
the
remarkable
gulf
of
liimfjord
in
jutland
nature
has
given
a
singular
example
of
a
canal
which
she
alternately
opens
as
a
marine
strait
and
by
shutting
again
converts
into
a
lagoon
the
liimfjord
was
doubtless
originally
an
open
channel
from
the
atlantic
to
the
baltic
between
two
islands
but
the
sand
washed
up
by
the
sea
blocked
up
the
western
entrance
and
built
a
wall
of
dunes
to
close
it
more
firmly
this
natural
dike
as
we
have
seen
has
been
more
than
once
broken
through
and
it
is
perhaps
in
the
power
of
man
either
permanently
to
maintain
the
barrier
or
to
remove
it
and
keep
a
navigable
channel
constantly
open
if
the
liimfjord
becomes
an
open
strait
the
washing
of
sea
sand
through
it
would
perhaps
block
up
some
of
the
belts
and
small
channels
now
important
for
the
navigation
of
the
baltic
and
the
direct
introduction
of
a
tidal
current
might
produce
very
perceptible
effects
on
the
hydrography
of
the
cattegat
suez
if
the
suez
canal
the
greatest
and
most
truly
cosmopolite
physical
improvement
ever
undertaken
by
man
shall
prove
successful
it
will
considerably
affect
the
basins
of
the
mediterranean
and
of
the
red
sea
though
in
a
different
manner
and
probably
in
a
less
degree
than
the
diversion
of
the
current
of
the
nile
from
the
one
to
the
other
to
which
i
shall
presently
refer
would
do
it
is
indeed
conceivable
that
if
a
free
channel
be
once
cut
from
sea
to
sea
the
coincidence
of
a
high
tide
and
a
heavy
south
wind
might
produce
a
hydraulic
force
that
would
convert
the
narrow
canal
into
an
open
strait
in
such
a
case
it
is
impossible
to
estimate
or
even
to
foresee
the
consequences
which
might
result
from
the
unobstructed
mingling
of
the
flowing
and
ebbing
currents
of
the
red
sea
with
the
almost
tideless
waters
of
the
mediterranean
there
can
be
no
doubt
however
that
they
would
be
of
a
most
important
character
as
respects
the
simply
geographical
features
and
the
organic
life
of
both
but
the
shallowness
of
the
two
seas
at
the
termini
of
the
canal
the
action
of
the
tides
of
the
one
and
the
currents
of
the
other
and
the
nature
of
the
intervening
isthmus
render
the
occurrence
of
such
a
cataclysm
in
the
highest
degree
improbable
the
obstruction
of
the
canal
by
sea
sand
at
both
ends
is
a
danger
far
more
difficult
to
guard
against
and
avert
than
an
irruption
of
the
waters
of
either
sea
there
is
then
no
reason
to
expect
any
change
of
coast
lines
or
of
natural
navigable
channels
as
a
direct
consequence
of
the
opening
of
the
suez
canal
but
it
will
no
doubt
produce
very
interesting
revolutions
in
the
animal
and
vegetable
population
of
both
basins
the
mediterranean
with
some
local
exceptions
such
as
the
bays
of
calabria
and
the
coast
of
sicily
so
picturesquely
described
by
quatrefages
is
comparatively
poor
in
marine
vegetation
and
in
shell
as
well
as
in
fin
fish
the
scarcity
of
fish
in
some
of
its
gulfs
is
proverbial
and
you
may
scrutinize
long
stretches
of
beach
on
its
northern
shores
after
every
south
wind
for
a
whole
winter
without
finding
a
dozen
shells
to
reward
your
search
but
no
one
who
has
not
looked
down
into
tropical
or
subtropical
seas
can
conceive
the
amazing
wealth
of
the
red
sea
in
organic
life
its
bottom
is
carpeted
or
paved
with
marine
plants
with
zoophytes
and
with
shells
while
its
waters
are
teeming
with
infinitely
varied
forms
of
moving
life
most
of
its
vegetables
and
its
animals
no
doubt
are
confined
by
the
laws
of
their
organization
to
warmer
temperatures
than
that
of
the
mediterranean
but
among
them
there
must
be
many
whose
habitat
is
of
a
wider
range
many
whose
powers
of
accommodation
would
enable
them
to
acclimate
themselves
in
a
colder
sea
we
may
suppose
the
less
numerous
aquatic
fauna
and
flora
of
the
mediterranean
to
be
equally
capable
of
climatic
adaptation
and
hence
when
the
canal
shall
be
opened
there
will
be
an
interchange
of
the
organic
population
not
already
common
to
both
seas
destructive
species
thus
newly
introduced
may
diminish
the
numbers
of
their
proper
prey
in
either
basin
and
on
the
other
hand
the
increased
supply
of
appropriate
food
may
greatly
multiply
the
abundance
of
others
and
at
the
same
time
add
important
contributions
to
the
aliment
of
man
in
the
countries
bordering
on
the
mediterranean
a
collateral
feature
of
this
great
project
deserves
notice
as
possessing
no
inconsiderable
geographical
importance
i
refer
to
the
conduit
or
conduits
constructed
from
the
nile
to
the
isthmus
primarily
to
supply
fresh
water
to
the
laborers
on
the
great
canal
and
ultimately
to
serve
as
aqueducts
for
the
city
of
suez
and
for
the
irrigation
and
reclamation
of
a
large
extent
of
desert
soil
in
the
flourishing
days
of
the
egyptian
empire
the
waters
of
the
nile
were
carried
over
important
districts
east
of
the
river
in
later
ages
most
of
this
territory
relapsed
into
a
desert
from
the
decay
of
the
canals
which
once
fertilized
it
there
is
no
difficulty
in
restoring
the
ancient
channels
or
in
constructing
new
and
thus
watering
not
only
all
the
soil
that
the
wisdom
of
the
pharaohs
had
improved
but
much
additional
land
hundreds
of
square
miles
of
arid
sand
waste
would
thus
be
converted
into
fields
of
perennial
verdure
and
the
geography
of
lower
egypt
would
be
thereby
sensibly
changed
if
the
canal
succeeds
considerable
towns
will
grow
up
at
once
at
both
ends
of
the
channel
and
at
intermediate
points
all
depending
on
the
maintenance
of
aqueducts
from
the
nile
both
for
water
and
for
the
irrigation
of
the
neighboring
fields
which
are
to
supply
them
with
bread
important
interests
will
thus
be
created
which
will
secure
the
permanence
of
the
hydraulic
works
and
of
the
geographical
changes
produced
by
them
and
suez
or

said
or
the
city
at
lake
timsah
may
become
the
capital
of
the
government
which
has
been
so
long
established
at
cairo
across
the
isthmus
of
the
most
colossal
project
of
canalization
ever
suggested
whether
we
consider
the
physical
difficulties
of
its
execution
the
magnitude
and
importance
of
the
waters
proposed
to
be
united
or
the
distance
which
would
be
saved
in
navigation
is
that
of
a
channel
between
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
pacific
across
the
isthmus
of
darien
i
do
not
now
speak
of
a
lock
canal
by
way
of
the
lake
of
nicaragua
or
any
other
route
for
such
a
work
would
not
differ
essentially
from
other
canals
and
would
scarcely
possess
a
geographical
character
but
of
an
open
cut
between
the
two
seas
it
has
been
by
no
means
shown
that
the
construction
of
such
a
channel
is
possible
and
if
it
were
opened
it
is
highly
probable
that
sand
bars
would
accumulate
at
both
entrances
so
as
to
obstruct
any
powerful
current
through
it
but
if
we
suppose
the
work
to
be
actually
accomplished
there
would
be
in
the
first
place
such
a
mixture
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
life
of
the
two
great
oceans
as
i
have
stated
to
be
likely
to
result
from
the
opening
of
the
suez
canal
between
two
much
smaller
basins
in
the
next
place
if
the
channel
were
not
obstructed
by
sand
bars
it
might
sooner
or
later
be
greatly
widened
and
deepened
by
the
mechanical
action
of
the
current
through
it
and
consequences
not
inferior
in
magnitude
to
any
physical
revolution
which
has
taken
place
since
man
appeared
upon
the
earth
might
result
from
it
what
those
consequences
would
be
is
in
a
great
degree
matter
of
pure
conjecture
and
there
is
much
room
for
the
exercise
of
the
imagination
on
the
subject
but
as
more
than
one
geographer
has
suggested
there
is
one
possible
result
which
throws
all
other
conceivable
effects
of
such
a
work
quite
into
the
shade
i
refer
to
changes
in
the
course
of
the
two
great
oceanic
rivers
the
gulf
stream
and
the
corresponding
current
on
the
pacific
side
of
the
isthmus
the
warm
waters
which
the
gulf
stream
transports
to
high
latitudes
and
then
spreads
out
like
an
expanded
hand
along
the
eastern
shores
of
the
atlantic
give
out
as
they
cool
heat
enough
to
raise
the
mean
temperature
of
western
europe
several
degrees
in
fact
the
gulf
stream
is
the
principal
cause
of
the
superiority
of
the
climate
of
western
europe
over
those
of
eastern
america
and
eastern
asia
in
the
corresponding
latitudes
all
the
meteorological
conditions
of
the
former
region
are
in
a
great
measure
regulated
by
it
and
hence
it
is
the
grandest
and
most
beneficent
of
all
purely
geographical
phenomena
we
do
not
yet
know
enough
of
the
laws
which
govern
the
movements
of
this
mighty
flood
of
warmth
and
life
to
be
able
to
say
whether
its
current
would
be
perceptibly
affected
by
the
severance
of
the
isthmus
of
darien
but
as
it
enters
and
sweeps
round
the
gulf
of
mexico
it
is
possible
that
the
removal
of
the
resistance
of
the
land
which
forms
the
western
shore
of
that
sea
might
allow
the
stream
to
maintain
its
original
westward
direction
and
join
itself
to
the
tropical
current
of
the
pacific
the
effect
of
such
a
change
would
be
an
immediate
depression
of
the
mean
temperature
of
western
europe
to
the
level
of
that
of
eastern
america
and
perhaps
the
climate
of
the
former
continent
might
become
as
excessive
as
that
of
the
latter
or
even
a
new
ice
period
be
occasioned
by
the
withdrawal
of
so
important
a
source
of
warmth
from
the
northern
zones
hence
would
result
the
extinction
of
vast
multitudes
of
land
and
sea
plants
and
animals
and
a
total
revolution
in
the
domestic
and
rural
economy
of
human
life
in
all
those
countries
from
which
the
new
world
has
received
its
civilized
population
other
scarcely
less
startling
consequences
may
be
imagined
as
possible
but
the
whole
speculation
is
too
dreary
distant
and
improbable
to
deserve
to
be
long
indulged
in
to
the
dead
the
project
of
captain
allen
for
opening
a
new
route
to
india
by
cuts
between
the
mediterranean
and
the
dead
sea
and
between
the
dead
sea
and
the
red
sea
presents
many
interesting
considerations
the
hypsometrical
observations
of
bertou
roth
and
others
render
it
highly
probable
if
not
certain
that
the
watershed
in
the
between
the
dead
sea
and
the
red
sea
is
not
less
than
three
hundred
feet
above
the
mean
level
of
the
latter
and
if
this
is
so
the
execution
of
a
canal
from
the
one
sea
to
the
other
is
quite
out
of
the
question
but
the
summit
level
between
the
mediterranean
and
the
jordan
near
jezreel
is
believed
to
be
little
if
at
all
more
than
one
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
and
the
distance
is
so
short
that
the
cutting
of
a
channel
through
the
dividing
ridge
would
probably
be
found
by
no
means
an
impracticable
undertaking
although
therefore
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
it
possible
to
open
a
navigable
channel
to
the
east
by
way
of
the
dead
sea
there
is
not
much
doubt
that
the
basin

empties
into
its

after
having
passed
through
the
lake
of
tiberias
at
an
elevation
of
feet
above
the
dead

or
below
the
mediterranean
and
drains
a
considerable
valley
north
of
the
lake
as
well
as
the
plain
of
jericho
which
lies
between
the
lake
and
the
sea
if
the
waters
of
the
mediterranean
were
admitted
freely
into
the
basin
of
the
dead
sea
they
would
raise
its
surface
to
the
general
level
of
the
ocean
and
consequently
flood
all
the
dry
land
below
that
level
within
the
basin
i
do
not
know
that
accurate
levels
have
been
taken
in
the
valley
of
the
jordan
above
the
lake
of
tiberias
and
our
information
is
very
vague
as
to
the
hypsometry
of
the
northern
part
of
the
as
little
do
we
know
where
a
contour
line
carried
around
the
basin
at
the
level
of
the
mediterranean
would
strike
its
eastern
and
western
borders
we
can
not
therefore
accurately
compute
the
extent
of
now
dry
land
which
would
be
covered
by
the
admission
of
the
waters
of
the
mediterranean
or
the
area
of
the
inland
sea
which
would
be
thus
created
its
length
however
would
certainly
exceed
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
and
its
mean
breadth
including
its
gulfs
and
bays
could
scarcely
be
less
than
fifteen
perhaps
even
twenty
it
would
cover
very
little
ground
now
occupied
by
civilized
or
even
uncivilized
man
though
some
of
the
soil
which
would
be
submerged
for
instance
that
watered
by
the
fountain
of
elisha
and
other
neighboring
sources
is
of
great
fertility
and
under
a
wiser
government
and
better
civil
institutions
might
rise
to
importance
because
from
its
depression
it
possesses
a
very
warm
climate
and
might
supply
southeastern
europe
with
tropical
products
more
readily
than
they
can
be
obtained
from
any
other
source
such
a
canal
and
sea
would
be
of
no
present
commercial
importance
because
they
would
give
access
to
no
new
markets
or
sources
of
supply
but
when
the
fertile
valleys
and
the
deserted
plains
east
of
the
jordan
shall
be
reclaimed
to
agriculture
and
civilization
these
waters
would
furnish
a
channel
of
communication
which
might
become
the
medium
of
a
very
extensive
trade
whatever
might
be
the
economical
results
of
the
opening
and
filling
of
the
dead
sea
basin
the
creation
of
a
new
evaporable
area
adding
not
less
than
or
perhaps
square
miles
to
the
present
fluid
surface
of
syria
could
not
fail
to
produce
important
meteorological
effects
the
climate
of
syria
would
be
tempered
its
precipitation
and
its
fertility
increased
the
courses
of
its
winds
and
the
electrical
condition
of
its
atmosphere
modified
the
present
organic
life
of
the
valley
would
be
extinguished
and
many
tribes
of
plants
and
animals
would
emigrate
from
the
mediterranean
to
the
new
home
which
human
art
had
prepared
for
them
it
is
possible
too
that
the
addition
of
feet
or
forty
atmospheres
of
hydrostatic
pressure
upon
the
bottom
of
the
basin
might
disturb
the
equilibrium
between
the
internal
and
the
external
forces
of
the
crust
of
the
earth
at
this
point
of
abnormal
configuration
and
thus
produce
geological
convulsions
the
intensity
of
which
can
not
be
even
conjectured
canals
in
a
maritime
canal
executed
and
another
projected
in
ancient
times
the
latter
of
which
is
again
beginning
to
excite
attention
deserve
some
notice
though
their
importance
is
of
a
commercial
rather
than
a
geographical
character
the
first
of
these
is
the
cut
made
by
xerxes
through
the
rock
which
connects
the
promontory
of
mount
athos
with
the
mainland
the
other
a
navigable
canal
through
the
isthmus
of
corinth
in
spite
of
the
testimony
of
herodotus
and
thucydides
the
romans
classed
the
canal
of
xerxes
among
the
fables
of
mendacious
greece
and
yet
traces
of
it
are
perfectly
distinct
at
the
present
day
through
its
whole
extent
except
at
a
single
point
where
after
it
had
become
so
choked
as
to
be
no
longer
navigable
it
was
probably
filled
up
to
facilitate
communication
by
land
between
the
promontory
and
the
country
in
the
rear
of
it
if
the
fancy
kingdom
of
greece
shall
ever
become
a
sober
reality
escape
from
its
tutelage
and
acquire
such
a
moral
as
well
as
political
status
that
its
own
capitalists
who
now
prefer
to
establish
themselves
and
employ
their
funds
anywhere
else
rather
than
in
their
native
land
have
any
confidence
in
the
permanency
of
its
institutions
a
navigable
channel
will
no
doubt
be
opened
between
the
gulfs
of
lepanto
and
ægina
the
annexation
of
the
ionian
islands
to
greece
will
make
such
a
work
almost
a
political
necessity
and
it
would
not
only
furnish
valuable
facilities
for
domestic
intercourse
but
become
an
important
channel
of
communication
between
the
levant
and
the
countries
bordering
on
the
adriatic
or
conducting
their
trade
through
that
sea
as
i
have
said
the
importance
of
this
latter
canal
and
of
a
navigable
channel
between
mount
athos
and
the
continent
would
be
chiefly
commercial
but
both
of
them
would
be
conspicuous
instances
of
the
control
of
man
over
nature
in
a
field
where
he
has
thus
far
done
little
to
interfere
with
her
spontaneous
arrangements
if
they
were
constructed
upon
such
a
scale
as
to
admit
of
the
free
passage
of
the
water
through
them
in
either
direction
as
the
prevailing
winds
should
impel
it
they
would
exercise
a
certain
influence
on
the
coast
currents
which
are
important
as
hydrographical
elements
and
also
as
producing
abrasion
of
the
coast
and
a
drift
at
the
bottom
of
seas
and
hence
would
be
entitled
to
a
higher
rank
than
simply
as
artificial
means
of
transit
of
it
has
been
thought
practicable
to
cut
a
canal
across
the
peninsula
of
gallipoli
from
the
outlet
of
the
sea
of
marmora
into
the
gulf
of
saros
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
mechanical
difficulties
of
such
a
work
would
not
be
found
insuperable
but
when
constantinople
shall
recover
the
important
political
and
commercial
rank
which
naturally
belongs
to
her
the
execution
of
such
a
canal
will
be
recommended
by
strong
reasons
of
military
expediency
as
well
as
by
the
interests
of
trade
an
open
channel
across
the
peninsula
would
divert
a
portion
of
the
water
which
now
flows
through
the
dardanelles
diminish
the
rapidity
of
that
powerful
current
and
thus
in
part
remove
the
difficulties
which
obstruct
the
navigation
of
the
strait
it
would
considerably
abridge
the
distance
by
water
between
constantinople
and
the
northern
coast
of
the
ægean
and
it
would
have
the
important
advantage
of
obliging
an
enemy
to
maintain
two
blockading
fleets
instead
of
one
cod
the
opening
of
a
navigable
cut
through
the
narrow
neck
which
separates
the
southern
part
of
cape
cod
bay
in
massachusetts
from
the
atlantic
was
long
ago
suggested
and
there
are
few
coast
improvements
on
the
atlantic
shores
of
the
united
states
which
are
recommended
by
higher
considerations
of
utility
it
would
save
the
most
important
coasting
trade
of
the
united
states
the
long
and
dangerous
navigation
around
cape
cod
afford
a
new
and
safer
entrance
to
boston
harbor
for
vessels
from
southern
ports
secure
a
choice
of
passages
thus
permitting
arrivals
upon
the
coast
and
departures
from
it
at
periods
when
wind
and
weather
might
otherwise
prevent
them
and
furnish
a
most
valuable
internal
communication
in
case
of
coast
blockade
by
a
foreign
power
the
difficulties
of
the
undertaking
are
no
doubt
formidable
but
the
expense
of
maintenance
and
the
uncertainty
of
the
effects
of
currents
setting
through
the
new
strait
are
still
more
serious
objections
of
the
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
project
of
great
physical
change
proposed
or
threatened
in
earlier
ages
is
that
of
the
diversion
of
the
nile
from
its
natural
channel
and
the
turning
of
its
current
into
either
the
libyan
desert
or
the
red
sea
the
ethiopian
or
abyssinian
princes
more
than
once
menaced
the
memlouk
sultans
with
the
execution
of
this
alarming
project
and
the
fear
of
so
serious
an
evil
is
said
to
have
induced
the
moslems
to
conciliate
the
abyssinian
kings
by
large
presents
and
by
some
concessions
to
the
oppressed
christians
of
egypt
indeed
arabic
historians
affirm
that
in
the
tenth
century
the
ethiopians
dammed
the
river
and
for
a
whole
year
cut
off
its
waters
from
egypt
the
probable
explanation
of
this
story
is
to
be
found
in
a
season
of
extreme
drought
such
as
have
sometimes
occurred
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
about
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
albuquerque
the
terrible
revived
the
scheme
of
turning
the
nile
into
the
red
sea
with
the
hope
of
destroying
the
transit
trade
through
egypt
by
way
of
kesseir
in
the
king
of
portugal
was
requested
by
the
emperor
of
abyssinia
to
send
him
engineers
for
that
purpose
a
successor
of
that
prince
threatened
to
attempt
the
project
about
the
year
and
even
as
late
as
the
french
occupation
of
egypt
the
possibility
of
driving
out
the
intruder
by
this
means
was
suggested
in
england
it
can
not
be
positively
affirmed
that
the
diversion
of
the
waters
of
the
nile
to
the
red
sea
is
impossible
in
the
chain
of
mountains
which
separates
the
two
valleys
brown
found
a
deep
depression
or
wadi
extending
from
the
one
to
the
other
at
no
great
elevation
above
the
bed
of
the
river
the
libyan
desert
is
so
much
higher
than
the
nile
below
the
junction
of
the
two
principal
branches
at
khartum
that
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
a
new
channel
for
their
united
waters
could
be
found
in
that
direction
but
the
flows
through
if
it
does
not
rise
in
a
great
table
land
and
some
of
its
tributaries
are
supposed
to
communicate
in
the
rainy
season
with
branches
of
great
rivers
flowing
in
quite
another
direction
hence
it
is
probable
that
a
portion
at
least
of
the
waters
of
this
great
arm
of
the
nile
and
perhaps
a
quantity
the
abstraction
of
which
would
be
sensibly
felt
in
egypt
might
be
sent
to
the
atlantic
by
the
niger
lost
in
the
inland
lakes
of
central
africa
or
employed
to
fertilize
the
libyan
sand
wastes
admitting
the
possibility
of
turning
the
whole
river
into
the
red
sea
let
us
consider
the
probable
effect
of
the
change
first
and
most
obvious
is
the
total
destruction
of
the
fertility
of
middle
and
lower
egypt
the
conversion
of
that
part
of
the
valley
into
a
desert
and
the
extinction
of
its
imperfect
civilization
if
not
the
absolute
extirpation
of
its
inhabitants
this
is
the
calamity
threatened
by
the
abyssinian
princes
and
the
ferocious
portuguese
warrior
and
feared
by
the
sultans
of
egypt
beyond
these
immediate
and
palpable
consequences
neither
party
then
looked
but
a
far
wider
geographical
area
and
far
more
extensive
and
various
human
interests
would
be
affected
by
the
measure
the
spread
of
the
nile
during
the
annual
inundation
covers
for
many
weeks
several
thousand
square
miles
with
water
and
at
other
seasons
of
the
year
pervades
the
same
and
even
a
larger
area
with
moisture
by
infiltration
the
abstraction
of
so
large
an
evaporable
surface
from
the
southern
shores
of
the
mediterranean
could
not
but
produce
important
effects
on
many
meteorological
phenomena
and
the
humidity
the
temperature
the
electrical
condition
and
the
atmospheric
currents
of
northeastern
africa
might
be
modified
to
a
degree
that
would
sensibly
affect
the
climate
of
europe
the
mediterranean
deprived
of
the
contributions
of
the
nile
would
require
a
larger
supply
and
of
course
a
stronger
current
of
water
from
the
atlantic
through
the
straits
of
gibraltar
the
proportion
of
salt
it
contains
would
be
increased
and
the
animal
life
of
at
least
its
southern
borders
would
be
consequently
modified
the
current
which
winds
along
its
southern
eastern
and
northeastern
shores
would
be
diminished
in
force
and
volume
if
not
destroyed
altogether
and
its
basin
and
its
harbors
would
be
shoaled
by
no
new
deposits
from
the
highlands
of
inner
africa
in
the
much
smaller
red
sea
more
immediately
perceptible
if
not
greater
effects
would
be
produced
the
deposits
of
slime
would
reduce
its
depth
and
perhaps
in
the
course
of
ages
divide
it
into
an
inland
and
an
open
sea
its
waters
would
be
more
or
less
freshened
and
its
immensely
rich
marine
fauna
and
flora
changed
in
character
and
proportion
and
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
perhaps
even
destroyed
altogether
its
navigable
channels
would
be
altered
in
position
and
often
quite
obstructed
the
flow
of
its
tides
would
be
modified
by
the
new
geographical
conditions
the
sediment
of
the
river
would
form
new
coast
lines
and
lowlands
which
would
be
covered
with
vegetation
and
probably
thereby
produce
sensible
climatic
changes
in
the
the
russian
government
has
contemplated
the
establishment
of
a
nearly
direct
water
communication
between
the
caspian
sea
and
the
sea
of
azoff
partly
by
natural
and
partly
by
artificial
channels
and
there
are
now
navigable
canals
between
the
don
and
the
volga
but
these
works
though
not
wanting
in
commercial
and
political
interest
do
not
possess
any
geographical
importance
it
is
however
very
possible
to
produce
appreciable
geographical
changes
in
the
basin
of
the
caspian
by
the
diversion
of
the
great
rivers
which
flow
from
central
russia
the
surface
of
the
caspian
is
feet
below
the
level
of
the
sea
of
azoff
and
its
depression
has
been
explained
upon
the
hypothesis
that
the
evaporation
exceeds
the
supply
derived
directly
and
indirectly
from
precipitation
though
able
physicists
now
maintain
that
the
sinking
of
this
sea
is
due
to
a
subsidence
of
its
bottom
from
geological
causes
at
tsaritsin
the
don
which
empties
into
the
sea
of
azoff
and
the
volga
which
pours
into
the
caspian
approach
each
other
within
ten
miles
near
this
point
by
means
of
open
or
subterranean
canals
the
don
might
be
turned
into
the
volga
or
the
volga
into
the
don
if
we
suppose
the
whole
or
a
large
proportion
of
the
waters
of
the
don
to
be
thus
diverted
from
their
natural
outlet
and
sent
down
to
the
caspian
the
equilibrium
between
the
evaporation
from
that
sea
and
its
supply
of
water
might
be
restored
or
its
level
even
raised
above
its
ancient
limits
if
the
volga
were
turned
into
the
sea
of
azoff
the
caspian
would
be
reduced
in
dimensions
until
the
balance
between
loss
and
gain
should
be
reëstablished
and
it
would
occupy
a
much
smaller
area
than
at
present
such
changes
in
the
proportion
of
solid
and
fluid
surface
would
have
some
climatic
effects
in
the
territory
which
drains
into
the
caspian
and
on
the
other
hand
the
introduction
of
a
greater
quantity
of
fresh
water
into
the
sea
of
azoff
would
render
that
gulf
less
saline
affect
the
character
and
numbers
of
its
fish
and
perhaps
be
not
wholly
without
sensible
influence
on
the
water
of
the
black
sea
in
north
american
we
are
not
yet
well
enough
acquainted
with
the
geography
of
central
africa
or
of
the
interior
of
south
america
to
conjecture
what
hydrographical
revolutions
might
there
be
wrought
but
from
the
fact
that
many
important
rivers
in
both
continents
drain
extensive
table
lands
of
very
moderate
inclination
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
important
changes
in
the
course
of
rivers
might
be
accomplished
our
knowledge
of
the
drainage
of
north
america
is
much
more
complete
and
it
is
certain
that
there
are
numerous
points
where
the
courses
of
great
rivers
or
the
discharge
of
considerable
lakes
might
be
completely
diverted
or
at
least
partially
directed
into
different
channels
the
surface
of
lake
erie
is
feet
above
that
of
the
hudson
at
albany
and
it
is
so
near
the
level
of
the
great
plain
lying
east
of
it
that
it
was
found
practicable
to
supply
the
western
section
of
the
canal
which
unites
it
with
the
hudson
with
water
from
the
lake
or
rather
from
the
niagara
which
flows
out
of
it
hence
a
channel
might
be
constructed
which
would
draw
off
into
the
valley
of
the
genesee
any
desirable
proportion
of
the
water
naturally
discharged
by
the
niagara
the
greatest
depth
of
water
yet
sounded
in
lake
erie
is
but
two
hundred
and
seventy
feet
the
mean
depth
one
hundred
and
twenty
open
canals
parallel
with
the
niagara
or
directly
toward
the
genesee
might
be
executed
upon
a
scale
which
would
exercise
an
important
influence
on
the
drainage
of
the
lake
if
there
were
any
adequate
motive
for
such
an
undertaking
still
easier
would
it
be
to
create
additional
outlets
for
the
waters
of
lake
superior
at
the
saut
mary
where
the
river
which
drains
the
lake
descends
feet
in
a
single
mile
and
thus
produce
incalculable
effects
both
upon
that
lake
and
upon
the
great
chain
of
inland
waters
which
communicate
with
it
the
summit
level
between
lake
michigan
and
the
des
plaines
a
tributary
of
the
mississippi
is
only
feet
above
the
lake
and
the
intervening
distance
is
but
a
very
few
miles
it
has
often
been
proposed
to
cut
an
open
channel
across
this
ridge
and
there
is
no
doubt
of
the
practicability
of
the
project
were
this
accomplished
although
such
a
cut
would
not
of
itself
form
a
navigable
canal
a
part
of
the
waters
of
lake
michigan
would
be
contributed
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
instead
of
to
that
of
lawrence
and
the
flow
might
be
so
regulated
as
to
keep
the
illinois
and
the
mississippi
at
flood
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
the
increase
in
the
volume
of
these
rivers
would
augment
their
velocity
and
their
transporting
power
and
consequently
the
erosion
of
their
banks
and
the
deposit
of
slime
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
while
the
introduction
of
a
larger
body
of
cold
water
into
the
beds
of
these
rivers
would
very
probably
produce
a
considerable
effect
on
the
animal
life
that
peoples
them
the
diversion
of
water
from
the
common
basin
of
the
great
lakes
through
a
new
channel
in
a
direction
opposite
to
their
natural
discharge
would
not
be
absolutely
without
influence
on
the
lawrence
though
probably
the
effect
would
be
too
small
to
be
in
any
way
perceptible
of
the
the
interference
of
physical
improvements
with
vested
rights
and
ancient
arrangements
is
a
more
formidable
obstacle
in
old
countries
than
in
new
to
enterprises
involving
anything
approaching
to
a
geographical
revolution
hence
such
projects
meet
with
stronger
opposition
in
europe
than
in
america
and
the
number
of
probable
changes
in
the
face
of
nature
in
the
former
continent
is
proportionally
less
i
have
noticed
some
important
hydraulic
improvements
as
already
executed
or
in
progress
in
europe
and
i
may
refer
to
some
others
as
contemplated
or
suggested
one
of
these
is
the
diversion
of
the
rhine
from
its
present
channel
below
ragatz
by
a
cut
through
the
narrow
ridge
near
sargans
and
the
consequent
turning
of
its
current
into
the
lake
of
wallenstadt
this
would
be
an
extremely
easy
undertaking
for
the
ridge
is
but
twenty
feet
above
the
level
of
the
rhine
and
hardly
two
hundred
yards
wide
there
is
no
present
adequate
motive
for
this
diversion
but
it
is
easy
to
suppose
that
it
may
become
advisable
within
no
long
period
the
navigation
of
the
lake
of
constance
is
rapidly
increasing
in
importance
and
the
shoaling
of
the
eastern
end
of
that
lake
by
the
deposits
of
the
rhine
may
require
a
remedy
which
can
be
found
by
no
other
so
ready
means
as
the
discharge
of
that
river
into
the
lake
of
wallenstadt
the
navigation
of
this
latter
lake
is
not
important
nor
is
it
ever
likely
to
become
so
because
the
rocky
and
precipitous
character
of
its
shores
renders
their
cultivation
impossible
it
is
of
great
depth
and
its
basin
is
capacious
enough
to
receive
and
retain
all
the
sediment
which
the
rhine
would
carry
into
it
for
thousands
of
years
of
the
i
have
referred
to
the
draining
of
the
lake
of
haarlem
as
an
operation
of
great
geographical
as
well
as
economical
and
mechanical
interest
a
much
more
gigantic
project
of
a
similar
character
is
now
engaging
the
attention
of
the
netherlandish
engineers
it
is
proposed
to
drain
the
great
basin
called
the
zuiderzee
this
inland
sea
covers
an
area
of
not
less
than
two
thousand
square
miles
or
about
one
million
three
hundred
thousand
acres
the
seaward
half
or
that
portion
lying
northwest
of
a
line
drawn
from
enkhuizen
to
stavoren
is
believed
to
have
been
converted
from
a
marsh
to
an
open
bay
since
the
fifth
century
after
christ
and
this
change
is
ascribed
partly
if
not
wholly
to
the
interference
of
man
with
the
order
of
nature
the
zuiderzee
communicates
with
the
sea
by
at
least
six
considerable
channels
separated
from
each
other
by
low
islands
and
the
tide
rises
within
the
basin
to
the
height
of
three
feet
to
drain
the
zuiderzee
these
channels
must
first
be
closed
and
the
passage
of
the
tidal
flood
through
them
cut
off
if
this
be
done
the
coast
currents
will
be
restored
approximately
to
the
lines
they
followed
fourteen
or
fifteen
centuries
ago
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
an
appreciable
effect
will
thus
be
produced
upon
all
the
tidal
phenomena
of
that
coast
and
of
course
upon
the
maritime
geography
of
holland
a
ring
dike
and
canal
must
then
be
constructed
around
the
landward
side
of
the
basin
to
exclude
and
carry
off
the
streams
which
now
empty
into
it
one
of
these
the
ijssel
a
considerable
river
has
a
course
of
eighty
miles
and
is
in
fact
one
of
the
outlets
of
the
rhine
though
augmented
by
the
waters
of
several
independent
tributaries
these
preparations
being
made
and
perhaps
transverse
dikes
erected
at
convenient
points
for
dividing
the
gulf
into
smaller
portions
the
water
must
be
pumped
out
by
machinery
in
substantially
the
same
way
as
in
the
case
of
the
lake
of
haarlem
no
safe
calculations
can
be
made
as
to
the
expenditure
of
time
and
money
required
for
the
execution
of
this
stupendous
enterprise
but
i
believe
its
practicability
is
not
denied
by
competent
judges
though
doubts
are
entertained
as
to
its
financial
expediency
the
geographical
results
of
this
improvement
would
be
analogous
to
those
of
the
draining
of
the
lake
of
haarlem
but
many
times
multiplied
in
extent
and
its
meteorological
effects
though
perhaps
not
perceptible
on
the
coast
could
hardly
fail
to
be
appreciable
in
the
interior
of
holland
of
the
the
singular
structure
of
the
karst
the
great
limestone
plateau
lying
to
the
north
of
trieste
has
suggested
some
engineering
operations
which
might
be
attended
with
sensible
effects
upon
the
geography
of
the
province
i
have
described
this
table
land
as
though
now
bare
of
forests
and
almost
of
vegetation
having
once
been
covered
with
woods
and
as
being
completely
honeycombed
by
caves
through
which
the
drainage
of
that
region
is
conducted
schmidl
has
spent
years
in
studying
the
subterranean
geography
and
hydrography
of
this
singular
district
and
his
discoveries
and
those
of
earlier
have
led
to
various
proposals
of
physical
improvement
of
a
novel
character
many
of
the
underground
water
courses
of
the
karst
are
without
visible
outlet
and
in
some
instances
at
least
they
no
doubt
send
their
waters
by
deep
channels
to
the
adriatic
the
city
of
trieste
is
very
insufficiently
provided
with
fresh
water
it
has
been
thought
practicable
to
supply
this
want
by
tunnelling
through
the
wall
of
the
plateau
which
rises
abruptly
in
the
rear
of
the
town
until
some
subterranean
stream
is
encountered
the
current
of
which
can
be
conducted
to
the
city
more
visionary
projectors
have
gone
further
and
imagined
that
advantage
might
be
taken
of
the
natural
tunnels
under
the
karst
for
the
passage
of
roads
railways
and
even
navigable
canals
but
however
chimerical
these
latter
schemes
may
seem
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
art
might
avail
itself
of
these
galleries
for
improving
the
imperfect
drainage
of
the
champaign
country
bounded
by
the
karst
and
that
stopping
or
opening
the
natural
channels
might
very
much
modify
the
hydrography
of
an
extensive
region
waters
of
there
are
parts
of
continental
greece
which
resemble
the
karst
and
the
adjacent
plains
in
being
provided
with
a
natural
subterranean
drainage
the
superfluous
waters
run
off
into
limestone
caves
called
greek
katabothra
in
ancient
times
the
entrances
to
the
catavothra
were
enlarged
or
partially
closed
as
the
convenience
of
drainage
or
irrigation
required
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
similar
measures
might
be
adopted
at
the
present
day
with
great
advantage
both
to
the
salubrity
and
the
productiveness
of
the
regions
so
drained
below
one
of
the
most
singular
changes
of
natural
surface
effected
by
man
is
that
observed
by
beechey
and
by
barth
at
lîn
tefla
and
near
gebel
genûnes
in
the
district
of
ben
gâsi
in
northern
africa
in
this
region
the
superficial
stratum
originally
consisted
of
a
thin
sheet
of
rock
covering
a
layer
of
fertile
earth
this
rock
has
been
broken
up
and
when
not
practicable
to
find
use
for
it
in
fences
fortresses
or
dwellings
heaped
together
in
high
piles
and
the
soil
thus
bared
of
its
stony
shell
has
been
employed
for
agricultural
purposes
if
we
remember
that
gunpowder
was
unknown
at
the
period
when
these
remarkable
improvements
were
executed
and
of
course
that
the
rock
could
have
been
broken
only
with
the
chisel
and
wedge
we
must
infer
that
land
had
at
that
time
a
very
great
pecuniary
value
and
of
course
that
the
province
though
now
exhausted
and
almost
entirely
deserted
by
man
had
once
a
dense
population
rock
with
if
man
has
in
some
cases
broken
up
rock
to
reach
productive
ground
beneath
he
has
in
many
other
instances
covered
bare
ledges
and
sometimes
extensive
surfaces
of
solid
stone
with
fruitful
earth
brought
from
no
inconsiderable
distance
not
to
speak
of
the
campo
santo
at
pisa
filled
or
at
least
coated
with
earth
from
the
holy
land
for
quite
a
different
purpose
it
is
affirmed
that
the
garden
of
the
monastery
of
catherine
at
mount
sinai
is
composed
of
nile
mud
transported
on
the
backs
of

from
the
banks
of
that
river
parthey
and
older
authors
state
that
all
the
productive
soil
of
the
island
of
malta
was
brought
over
from
sicily
the
accuracy
of
the
information
may
be
questioned
in
both
cases
but
similar
practices
on
a
smaller
scale
are
matter
of
daily
observation

parts
of

on
the

forchhammer
wherever
a
bolt
from
a
wreck
or
any
other
fragment
of
iron
is
deposited
in
the
beach
sand
the
particles
are
cemented
together
and
form
a
very
solid
mass
around
the
iron
a
remarkable
formation
of
this
sort
was
observed
a
few
years
ago
in
constructing
the
sea
wall
of
the
harbor
of
elsineur
this
stratum
which
seldom
exceeded
a
foot
in
thickness
rested
upon
common
beach
sand
and
was
found
at
various
depths
less
near
the
shore
greater
at
some
distance
from
it
it
was
composed
of
pebbles
and
sand
and
contained
a
great
quantity
of

and
some
coins
of
the

of
christian
iv
between
the
beginning
and
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
here
and
there
a
coating
of
metallic
copper
had
been
deposited
by
galvanic
action
and
the
presence
of
completely
oxydized
metallic
iron
was
often
detected
an
investigation
undertaken
by
councillor
reinhard
and
myself
at
the
instance
of
the
society
of
science
made
it
in
the
highest
degree
probable
that
this
formation
owed
its
origin
to
the
street
sweepings
of
the
town
which
had
been
thrown
upon
the
beach
and
carried
off
and
distributed
by
the
waves
over
the
bottom
of
the
harbor
these
and
other
familiar
observations
of
the
like
sort
show
that
a
sandstone
reef
of
no
inconsiderable
magnitude
might
originate
from
the
stranding
of
a
ship
with
a
cargo
of
iron
or
from
throwing
the
waste
of
an
establishment
for
working
metals
into
running
water
which
might
carry
it
to
the
sea
parthey
records
a
singular
instance
of
unforeseen
mischief
from
an
interference
with
the
arrangements
of
nature
a
landowner
at
malta
possessed
a
rocky
plateau
sloping
gradually
toward
the
sea
and
terminating
in
a
precipice
forty
or
fifty
feet
high
through
natural
openings
in
which
the
sea
water
flowed
into
a
large
cave
under
the
rock
the
proprietor
attempted
to
establish
salt
works
on
the
surface
and
cut
shallow
pools
in
the
rock
for
the
evaporation
of
the
water
in
order
to
fill
the
salt
pans
more
readily
he
sank
a
well
down
to
the
cave
beneath
through
which
he
drew
up
water
by
a
windlass
and
buckets
the
speculation
proved
a
failure
because
the
water
filtered
through
the
porous
bottom
of
the
pans
leaving
little
salt
behind
but
this
was
a
small
evil
compared
with
other
destructive
consequences
that
followed
when
the
sea
was
driven
into
the
cave
by
violent
west
or
northwest
winds
it
shot
a
through
the
well
to
the
height
of
sixty
feet
the
spray
of
which
was
scattered
far
and
wide
over
the
neighboring
gardens
and
blasted
the
crops
the
well
was
now
closed
with
stones
but
the
next
winter
storms
hurled
them
out
again
and
spread
the
salt
spray
over
the
grounds
in
the
vicinity
as
before
repeated
attempts
were
made
to
stop
the
orifice
but
at
the
time
of
parthey
visit
the
sea
had
thrice
burst
through
and
it
was
feared
that
the
evil
was
without
remedy
i
have
mentioned
the
great
extent
of
the
heaps
of
oyster
and
other
shells
left
by
the
american
indians

some
of
the

a
thousand
feet
long
from
one
hundred
and
fifty
to
two
hundred

from

these

have
an
importance
as
geological
witnesses
independent
of
their
bearing
upon

wherever
the

appears
from
other
evidence
to
have
remained
unchanged
in

and
elevation
since
they
were
accumulated
they
are
found
near
the

and
not
more
than
about
ten
feet
above
its

in
some
cases
they
are
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
beach
and
in
these
instances
so
far
as
yet
examined
there
are
proofs
that
the

has
advanced
in
consequence
of
upheaval
or
of
fluviatile
or
marine
deposit
where
they
are
altogether
wanting
the
coast
seems
to
have
sunk
or
been
washed
away
by
the

the
constancy
of
these
observations
justifies
geologists
in
arguing
where

wanting

of

or

every
traveller
in
italy
is
familiar
with
monte
testaccio
the
mountain
of
potsherds
at
rome
but
this
deposit
large
as
it
is
shrinks
into
insignificance
when
compared
with
masses
of
similar
origin
in
the
neighborhood
of
older
cities
the
castaway
pottery
of
ancient
towns
in
magna
græcia
composes
strata
of
such
extent
and
thickness
that
they
have
been
dignified
with
the
appellation
of
the
ceramic
formation
the
nile
as
it
slowly
changes
its
bed
exposes
in
its
banks
masses
of
the
same
material
so
vast
that
the
population
of
the
world
during
the
whole
historical
period
would
seem
to
have
chosen
this
valley
as
a
general
deposit
for
its
broken
vessels
the
fertility
imparted
to
the
banks
of
the
nile
by
the
water
and
the
slime
of
the
inundations
is
such
that
manures
are
little
employed
hence
much
domestic
waste
which
would
elsewhere
be
employed
to
enrich
the
soil
is
thrown
out
into
vacant
places
near
the
town
hills
of
rubbish
are
thus
piled
up
which
astonish
the
traveller
almost
as
much
as
the
solid
pyramids
themselves
the
heaps
of
ashes
and
other
household
refuse
collected
on
the
borders
and
within
the
limits
of
cairo
were
so
large
that
the
removal
of
them
by
ibrahim
pacha
has
been
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
great
works
of
the
age
the
soil
near
cities
the
street
sweepings
of
which
are
spread
upon
the
ground
as
manure
is
perceptibly
raised
by
them
and
by
other
effects
of
human
industry
and
in
spite
of
all
efforts
to
remove
the
waste
the
level
of
the
ground
on
which
large
towns
stand
is
constantly
elevated
the
present
streets
of
rome
are
twenty
feet
above
those
of
the
ancient
city
the
appian
way
between
rome
and
albano
when
cleared
out
a
few
years
ago
was
found
buried
four
or
five
feet
deep
and
the
fields
along
the
road
were
elevated
nearly
or
quite
as
much
the
floors
of
many
churches
in
italy
not
more
than
six
or
seven
centuries
old
are
now
three
or
four
feet
below
the
adjacent
streets
though
it
is
proved
by
excavations
that
they
were
built
as
many
feet
above
them
to
great
natural
i
have
often
spoken
of
the
greater
and
more
subtile
natural
forces
and
especially
of
geological
agencies
as
powers
beyond
human
guidance
or
resistance
this
is
no
doubt
at
present
true
in
the
main
but
man
has
shown
that
he
is
not
altogether
impotent
to
struggle
with
even
these
mighty
servants
of
nature
and
his
unconscious
as
well
as
his
deliberate
action
may
in
some
cases
have
increased
or
diminished
the
intensity
of
their
energies
it
is
a
very
ancient
belief
that
earthquakes
are
more
destructive
in
districts
where
the
crust
of
the
earth
is
solid
and
homogeneous
than
where
it
is
of
a
looser
and
more
interrupted
structure
aristotle
pliny
the
elder
and
seneca
believed
that
not
only
natural
ravines
and
caves
but
quarries
wells
and
other
human
excavations
which
break
the
continuity
of
the
terrestrial
strata
and
facilitate
the
escape
of
elastic
vapors
have
a
sensible
influence
in
diminishing
the
violence
and
preventing
the
propagation
of
the
earth
waves
in
all
countries
subject
to
earthquakes
this
opinion
is
still
maintained
and
it
is
asserted
that
both
in
ancient
and
in
modern
times
buildings
protected
by
deep
wells
under
or
near
them
have
suffered
less
from
earthquakes
than
those
the
architects
of
which
have
neglected
this
precaution
if
the
commonly
received
theory
of
the
cause
of
earthquakes
is
true
that
namely
which
ascribes
them
to
the
elastic
force
of
gases
accumulated
or
generated
in
subterranean
reservoirs
it
is
evident
that
open
channels
of
communication
between
such
reservoirs
and
the
atmosphere
might
serve
as
a
harmless
discharge
of
gases
that
would
otherwise
acquire
destructive
energy
the
doubt
is
whether
artificial
excavations
can
be
carried
deep
enough
to
reach
the
laboratory
where
the
elastic
fluids
are
distilled
there
are
in
many
places
small
natural
crevices
through
which
such
fluids
escape
and
the
source
of
them
sometimes
lies
at
so
moderate
a
depth
that
they
pervade
the
superficial
soil
and
as
it
were
transpire
from
it
over
a
considerable
area
when
the
borer
of
an
ordinary
artesian
well
strikes
into
a
cavity
in
the
earth
imprisoned
air
often
rushes
out
with
great
violence
and
this
has
been
still
more
frequently
observed
in
sinking
wells
in
this
latter
case
the
discharge
of
a
vehement
current
of
inflammable
fluid
sometimes
continues
for
hours
and
even
longer
periods
these
facts
seem
to
render
it
not
wholly
improbable
that
the
popular
belief
of
the
efficacy
of
deep
wells
in
mitigating
the
violence
of
earthquakes
is
well
founded
in
general
light
wooden
buildings
are
less
injured
by
earthquakes
than
more
solid
structures
of
stone
or
brick
and
it
is
commonly
supposed
that
the
power
put
forth
by
the
earth
wave
is
too
great
to
be
resisted
by
any
amount
of
weight
or
solidity
of
mass
that
man
can
pile
up
upon
the
surface
but
the
fact
that
in
countries
subject
to
earthquakes
many
very
large
and
strongly
constructed
palaces
temples
and
other
monuments
have
stood
for
centuries
comparatively
uninjured
suggests
a
doubt
whether
this
opinion
is
sound
the
earthquake
of
the
first
of
november
which
was
felt
over
a
twelfth
part
of
the
surface
was
probably
the
most
violent
of
which
we
have
any
clear
and
distinct
account
and
it
seems
to
have
exerted
its
most
destructive
force
at
lisbon
it
has
often
been
noticed
as
a
remarkable
fact
that
the
mint
a
building
of
great
solidity
was
almost
wholly
unaffected
by
the
shock
which
shattered
every
house
and
church
in
the
city
and
its
escape
from
the
common
ruin
can
hardly
be
accounted
for
except
upon
the
supposition
that
its
weight
compactness
and
strength
of
material
enabled
it
to
resist
an
agitation
of
the
earth
which
overthrew
all
weaker
structures
on
the
other
hand
a
stone
pier
in
the
harbor
of
lisbon
on
which
thousands
of
people
had
taken
refuge
sank
with
its
foundations
to
a
great
depth
during
the
same
earthquake
and
it
is
plain
that
where
subterranean
cavities
exist
at
moderate
depths
the
erection
of
heavy
masses
upon
them
would
tend
to
promote
the
breaking
down
of
the
strata
which
roof
them
over
no
physicist
i
believe
has
supposed
that
man
can
avert
the
eruption
of
a
volcano
or
diminish
the
quantity
of
melted
rock
which
it
pours
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
earth
but
it
is
not
always
impossible
to
divert
the
course
of
even
a
large
current
of
lava
the
smaller
streams
of
lava
near
catania
says
ferrara
in
describing
the
great
eruption
of
were
turned
from
their
course
by
building
dry
walls
of
stone
as
a
barrier
against
them
it
was
proposed
to
divert
the
main
current
from
catania
and
fifty
men
protected
by
hides
were
sent
with
hooks
and
iron
bars
to
break
the
flank
of
the
stream
near
belpasso
when
the
opening
was
made
fluid
lava
poured
forth
and
flowed
rapidly
toward
paterno
but
the
inhabitants
of
that
place
not
caring
to
sacrifice
their
own
town
to
save
catania
rushed
out
in
arms
and
put
a
stop
to
the
operation
in
the
eruption
of
vesuvius
in
the
viceroy
saved
from
impending
destruction
the
town
of
portici
and
the
valuable
collection
of
antiquities
then
deposited
there
but
since
removed
to
naples
by
employing
several
thousand
men
to
dig
a
ditch
above
the
town
by
which
the
lava
current
was
carried
off
in
another
direction
of
the
excavations
made
by
man
for
mining
and
other
purposes
may
sometimes
occasion
disturbance
of
the
surface
by
the
subsidence
of
the
strata
above
them
as
in
the
case
of
the
mine
of
fahlun
but
such
accidents
must
always
be
too
inconsiderable
in
extent
to
deserve
notice
in
a
geographical
point
of
view
such
excavations
however
may
interfere
materially
with
the
course
of
subterranean
waters
and
it
has
even
been
conjectured
that
the
removal
of
large
bodies
of
metallic
ore
from
their
original
deposits
might
at
least
locally
affect
the
magnetic
and
electrical
condition
of
the
earth
crust
to
a
sensible
degree
accidental
fires
in
mines
of
coal
or
lignite
sometimes
lead
to
consequences
not
only
destructive
to
large
quantities
of
valuable
material
but
may
directly
or
indirectly
produce
results
important
in
geography
the
coal
occasionally
takes
fire
from
the
miners
lights
or
other
fires
used
by
them
and
if
long
exposed
to
air
in
deserted
galleries
may
be
spontaneously
kindled
under
favorable
circumstances
a
stratum
of
coal
will
burn
till
it
is
exhausted
and
a
cavity
may
be
burnt
out
in
a
few
months
which
human
labor
could
not
excavate
in
many
years
wittwer
informs
us
that
a
coal
mine
at
etienne
in
dauphiny
has
been
burning
ever
since
the
fourteenth
century
and
that
a
mine
near
duttweiler
another
near
epterode
and
a
third
at
zwickau
have
been
on
fire
for
two
hundred
years
such
conflagrations
not
only
produce
cavities
in
the
earth
but
communicate
a
perceptible
degree
of
heat
to
the
surface
and
the
author
just
quoted
cites
cases
where
this
heat
has
been
advantageously
employed
in
forcing
vegetation
espy
well
known
suggestion
of
the
possibility
of
causing
rain
artificially
by
kindling
great
fires
is
not
likely
to
be
turned
to
practical
account
but
the
speculations
of
this
able
meteorologist
are
not
for
that
reason
to
be
rejected
as
worthless
his
labors
exhibit
great
industry
in
the
collection
of
facts
much
ingenuity
in
dealing
with
them
remarkable
insight
into
the
laws
of
nature
and
a
ready
perception
of
analogies
and
relations
not
obvious
to
minds
less
philosophically
constituted
they
have
unquestionably
contributed
very
essentially
to
the
advancement
of
meteorological
science
the
possibility
that
the
distribution
and
action
of
electricity
may
be
considerably
modified
by
long
lines
of
iron
railways
and
telegraph
wires
is
a
kindred
thought
and
in
fact
rests
much
on
the
same
foundation
as
the
belief
in
the
utility
of
lightning
rods
but
such
influence
is
too
obscure
and
too
small
to
have
been
yet
detected
the
manifestation
of
the
internal
heat
of
the
earth
at
any
given
point
is
conditioned
by
the
thickness
of
the
crust
at
such
point
the
deposits
of
rivers
tend
to
augment
that
thickness
at
their
estuaries
the
sediment
of
slowly
flowing
rivers
emptying
into
shallow
seas
is
spread
over
so
great
a
surface
that
we
can
hardly
imagine
the
foot
or
two
of
slime
they
let
fall
over
a
wide
area
in
a
century
to
form
an
element
among
even
the
infinitesimal
quantities
which
compose
the
terms
of
the
equations
of
nature
but
some
swift
rivers
rolling
mountains
of
fine
earth
discharge
themselves
into
deeply
scooped
gulfs
or
bays
and
in
such
cases
the
deposit
amounts
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
to
a
mass
the
transfer
of
which
from
the
surface
of
a
large
basin
and
its
accumulation
at
a
single
point
may
be
supposed
to
produce
other
effects
than
those
measurable
by
the
sounding
line
now
almost
all
the
operations
of
rural
life
as
i
have
abundantly
shown

the
liability
of
the
soil
to
erosion
by
water
hence
the
clearing
of
the
valley
of
the
ganges
by
man
must
have
much
augmented
the
quantity
of
earth
transported
by
that
river
to
the
sea
and
of
course
have
strengthened
the
effects
whatever
they
may
be
of
thickening
the
crust
of
the
earth
in
the
bay
of
bengal
in
such
cases
then
human
action
must
rank
among
geological
influences
small
in
it
is
a
legal
maxim
that
the

non

in
the
vocabulary

her

in

the
human
operations
mentioned
in
the
last
few
paragraphs
therefore
do
act
in
the
ways
ascribed
to
them
though
our
limited
faculties
are
at
present
perhaps
forever
incapable
of
weighing
their
immediate
still
more
their
ultimate
consequences
but
our
inability
to
assign
definite
values
to
these
causes
of
the
disturbance
of
natural
arrangements
is
not
a
reason
for
ignoring
the
existence
of
such
causes
in
any
general
view
of
the
relations
between
man
and
nature
and
we
are
never
justified
in
assuming
a
force
to
be
insignificant
because
its
measure
is
unknown
or
even
because
no
physical
effect
can
now
be
traced
to
it

its
origin
the

must
precede
the
analysis
of
them
and
every
new
fact
illustrative
of
the
action
and
reaction
between
humanity
and
the
material
world
around
it
is
another
step
toward
the
determination
of
the
great
question
whether

is

this

the

of
the

to
say
that

the

been
observed
in

has
been
much
doubted
whether
the

those

whether
in

used

they

though

rudely

its
artificial
character
and
its
special
purpose
are
quite
unequivocal
probably
no
cultivated
vegetable
affords
so
good
an
opportunity
of
studying
the
laws
of
acclimation
of
plants
as
maize
or
indian
corn
maize
is
grown
from
the
tropics
to
at
least
lat
in
northeastern
america
and
farther
north
in
europe
every
two
or
three
degrees
of
latitude
brings
you
to
a
new
variety
with
new
climatic
adaptations
and
the
capacity
of
the
plant
to
accommodate
itself
to
new
conditions
of
temperature
and
season
seems
almost
unlimited
we
may
easily
suppose
a
variety
of
this
grain
which
had
become
acclimated
in
still
higher
latitudes
to
have
been
lost
and
in
such
case
the
failure
to
raise
a
crop
from
seed
brought
from
some
distance
to
the
south
would
not
prove
that
the
climate
had
become
colder
many
persons
now
living
remember
that
when
the
common
tomato
was
first
introduced
into
northern
new
england
it
often
failed
to
ripen
but
in
the
course
of
a
very
few
years
it
completely
adapted
itself
to
the
climate
and
now
not
only
matures
both
its
fruit
and
its
seeds
with
as
much
certainty
as
any
cultivated
vegetable
but
regularly
propagates
itself
by
seed
meteorological
observations
however
do
not
show
any
amelioration
of
the
summer
climate
in
those
states
within
that
period
see
no
maize
and
the
tomato
if
not
new
to
human
use
have
not
been
long
known
to
civilization
and
were
very
probably
reclaimed
and
domesticated
at
a
much
more
recent
period
than
the
plants
which
form
the
great
staples
of
agricultural
husbandry
in
europe
and
asia
is
the
great
power
of
accomodation
to
climate
possessed
by
them
due
to
this
circumstance
there
is
some
reason
to
suppose
that
the
character
of
maize
has
been
sensibly
changed
by
cultivation
in
south
america
for
according
to
pöppig
the
ears
of
this
grain
found
in
old
peruvian
tombs
belong
to
varieties
not
now
known
in

the
cultivation
of

is

to
have
been

by

oriental
in

it
was
first
planted
in
the
neighborhood
of

it
has
been

in

district
for
less
than
a

i
believe
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
cultivation
of
madder
in
the
vicinity
of
avignon
is
of
recent
introduction
but
it
appears
from
fuller
and
other
evidence
that
this
plant
was
grown
in
europe
before
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
madder
brought

may
be
of
a

at

thirty

the

malady

insect
is
supposed
by
some
to
be
the
effect
of
an
incipient
decay
of
the
mulberry
tree
may
be
in
part
due
to
changes
produced
in
the
character
of
the
soil
by
exhaustion
through
long
cultivation
in
many
parts
of
new
england
there
are
tracts
miles
in
extent
and
presenting
all
varieties
of
surface
and
exposure
which
were
partially
cleared
sixty
or
seventy
years
ago
and
where
little
or
no
change
in
the
proportion
of
cultivated
ground
pasturage
and
woodland
has
taken
place
since
in
some
cases
these
tracts
compose
basins
apparently
scarcely
at
all
exposed
to
any
local
influence
in
the
way
of
percolation
or
infiltration
of
water
toward
or
from
neighboring
valleys
but
in
such
situations
apart
from
accidental
disturbances
the
ground
is
growing
drier
and
drier
from
year
to
year
springs
are
still
disappearing
and
rivulets
still
diminishing
in
their
summer
supply
of
water
a
probable
explanation
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
rapid
drainage
of
the
surface
of
cleared
ground
which
prevents
the
subterranean
natural
reservoirs
whether
cavities
or
merely
strata
of
bibulous
earth
from
filling
up
how
long
this
process
is
to
last
before
an
equilibrium
is
reached
none
can
say
it
may
be
for
years
it
may
be
for
centuries
livingstone
states
facts
which
favor
the
supposition
that
a
secular
desiccation
is
still
going
on
in
central
africa
when
the
regions
where
the
earth
is
growing
drier
were
cleared
of
wood
or
indeed
whether
forests
ever
grew
there
we
are
unable
to
say
but
the
change
appears
to
have
been
long
in
progress
there
is
reason
to
suspect
a
similar
revolution
in
arabia
petræa
in
many
of
the
wadis
and
particularly
in
the
gorges
between
wadi
feiran
and
wadi
esh
sheikh
there
are
banks
showing
that
at
no
very
remote
period
the
winter
floods
must
have
risen
fifty
feet
in
channels
where
the
growth
of
acacias
and
tamarisks
and
the
testimony
of
the
arabs
concur
to
prove
that
they
have
not
risen
six
feet
within
the
memory
or
tradition
of
the
present
inhabitants
there
is
little
probability
that
any
considerable
part
of
the
sinaitic
peninsula
has
been
wooded
since
its
first
occupation
by
man
and
we
must
seek
the
cause
of
its
increasing
dryness
elsewhere
than
in
the
removal
of
the
forest
the
soil
of
newly
subdued
countries
is
generally
in
a
high
degree
favorable
to
the
growth
of
the
fruits
of
the
garden
and
the
orchard
but
usually
becomes
much
less
so
in
a
very
few
years
plums
of
many
varieties
were
formerly
grown
in
great
perfection
and
abundance
in
many
parts
of
new
england
where
at
present
they
can
scarcely
be
reared
at
all
and
the
peach
which
a
generation
or
two
ago
succeeded
admirably
in
the
southern
portion
of
the
same
states
has
almost
ceased
to
be
cultivated
there
the
disappearance
of
these
fruits
is
partly
due
to
the
ravages
of
insects
which
have
in
later
years
attacked
them
but
this
is
evidently
by
no
means
the
sole
or
even
the
principal
cause
of
their
decay
in
these
cases
it
is
not
to
the
exhaustion
of
the
particular
acres
on
which
the
fruit
trees
have
grown
that
we
are
to
ascribe
their
degeneracy
but
to
a
general
change
in
the
condition
of
the
soil
or
the
air
for
it
is
equally
impossible
to
rear
them
successfully
on
absolutely
new
land
in
the
neighborhood
of
grounds
where
not
long
since
they
bore
the
finest
fruit
i
remember
being
told
many
years
ago
by
one
of
the
earliest
settlers
of
the
state
of
ohio
a
very
intelligent
and
observing
person
that
the
apple
trees
raised
there
from
seed
sown
soon
after
the
land
was
cleared
bore
fruit
in
less
than
half
the
time
required
to
bring
to
bearing
those
reared
from
seed
sown
when
the
ground
had
been
twenty
years
under
cultivation
in
the
peat
mosses
of
denmark
scotch
firs
and
other
trees
not
now
growing
in
the
same
localities
are
found
in
abundance
every
generation
of
trees
leaves
the
soil
in
a
different
state
from

the
nomenclature
of
meteorology
is
vague
and
sometimes
equivocal
not
long
since
it
was
suspected
that
the
observers
reporting
to
a
scientific
institution
did
not
agree
in
their
understanding
of
the
mode
of
expressing
the
direction
of
the
wind
prescribed
by
their
instructions
it
was
found
upon
inquiry
that
very
many
of
them
used
the
names
of
the
to
indicate
the
quarter
which
the
wind
blew
while
others
employed
them
to
signify
the
quarter
which
the
atmospheric
currents
were
moving
in
some
instances
the
observers
were
no
longer
within
the
reach
of
inquiry
and
of
course
their
tables
of
the
wind
were
of
no
value
winds
says
somerville
are
named
from
the
points
whence
they
blow
currents
exactly
the
reverse
an
easterly
wind
comes
from
the
east
whereas
an
easterly
current
comes
from
the
west
and
flows
toward
the
east
there
is
no
philological
ground
for
this
distinction
and
it
probably
originated
in
a
confusion
of
the
terminations
and
both
of
which
are
modern
the
root
of

the
direction
or
which
motion

is

fact
that

not
indeed

to

the
conquest
of

as
exclusively

advanced

the

seem
to
cherish

sympathies
which
are

more
feebly

a
certain
community

brute
animals

explain

the

find
in

of
this

many
amusing
notices
of
a
similar
feeling
entertained
by
the
moors
toward
the
redoubtable
enemy
of
their

the
lion
this
sympathy
helps
us
to
understand
how
it
is
that
most
if
not
all
the
domestic
animals
if
indeed
they
ever
existed
in
a
wild
state
were
appropriated
reclaimed
and
trained
before
men
had
been
gathered
into
organized
and
fixed
communities
that
almost
every
known
esculent
plant
had
acquired
substantially
its
present
artificial
character
and
that
the
properties
of
nearly
all
vegetable
drugs
and
poisons
were
known
at
the
remotest
period
to
which
historical
records
reach
did
nature
bestow
upon
primitive
man
some
instinct
akin
to
that
by
which
she
teaches
the
brute
to
select
the
nutritious
and
to
reject
the
noxious
vegetables
indiscriminately
mixed
in
forest
and
pasture
this
instinct
it
must
be
admitted
is
far
from
infallible
and
as
has
been
hundreds
of
times
remarked
by
naturalists
it
is
in
many
cases
not
an
original
faculty
but
an
acquired
and
transmitted
habit
it
is
a
fact
familiar
to
persons
engaged
in
sheep
husbandry
in
new
england
and
i
have
seen
it
confirmed
by
personal
observation
that
sheep
bred
where
the
common
laurel
as
it
is
called
abounds
almost
always
avoid
browsing
upon
the
leaves
of
that
plant
while
those
brought
from
districts
where
laurel
is
unknown
and
turned
into
pastures
where
it
grows
very
often
feed
upon
it
and
are
poisoned
by
it
a
curious
acquired
and
hereditary
instinct
of
a
different
character
may
not
improperly
be
noticed
here
i
refer
to
that
by
which
horses
bred
in
provinces
where
quicksands
are
common
avoid
their
dangers
or
extricate
themselves
from
them

it
is
commonly
said
in

i
believe
with
reason
that
the
crows
of
this
generation
are
wiser
than
their
ancestors
scarecrows
which
were
effectual
fifty
years
ago
are
no
longer
respected
by
the
plunderers
of

and
new

must
from
time
to
time
be
invented
for
its
protection
see
no
civilization
has
added
little
to
the
number
of
vegetable
or
animal
species
grown
in
our
fields
or
bred
in
our
folds
while
on
the
contrary
the
subjugation
of
the
inorganic
forces
and
the
consequent
extension
of
man
sway
over
not
the
annual
products
of
the
earth
only
but
her
substance
and
her
springs
of
action
is
almost
entirely
the
work
of
highly
refined
and
cultivated
ages
the
employment
of
the
elasticity
of
wood
and
of
horn
as
a
projectile
power
in
the
bow
is
nearly
universal
among
the
rudest
savages
the
application
of
compressed
air
to
the
same
purpose
in
the
blowpipe
is
more
restricted
and
the
use
of
the
mechanical
powers
the
inclined
plane
the
wheel
and
axle
and
even
the
wedge
and
lever
seems
almost
unknown
except
to
civilized
man
i
have
myself
seen
european
peasants
to
whom
one
of
the
simplest
applications
of
this
latter
power
was
a
revelation
the
difference
between
the
relations
of
savage
life
and
of
incipient
civilization
to
nature
is
well
seen
in
that
part
of
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
which
was
once
occupied
by
the
mound
builders
and
afterward
by
the
far
less
developed
indian
tribes
when
the
tillers
of
the
fields
which
must
have
been
cultivated
to
sustain
the
large
population
that
once
inhabited
those
regions
perished
or
were
driven
out
the
soil
fell
back
to
the
normal
forest
state
and
the
savages
who
succeeded
the
more
advanced
race
interfered
very
little
if
at
all
with
the
ordinary
course
of
spontaneous
nature
there
is
a
possible
but
only
a
possible
exception

the

of

whatever
may
be
thought
of
the
modification
of
organic
species
by
natural
selection
there
is
certainly
no
evidence
that
animals
have
exerted
upon
any
form
of
life
an
influence
analogous
to
that
of
domestication
upon
plants
quadrupeds
and
birds
reared
artificially
by
man
and
this
is
as
true
of
unforeseen
as
of
purposely
effected
improvements
accomplished
by
voluntary
selection
of
breeding
animals
and
it
may
be
remarked
that
as
the
world
has
passed
through
these
several
stages
of
strife
to
produce
a
christendom
so
by
relaxing
in
the
enterprises
it
has
learnt
does
it
tend
downwards
through
inverted
steps
to
wildness
and
the
waste
again
let
a
people
give
up
their
contest
with
moral
evil
disregard
the
injustice
the
ignorance
the
greediness
that
may
prevail
among
them
and
part
more
and
more
with
the
christian
element
of
their
civilization
and
in
declining
this
battle
with
sin
they
will
inevitably
get
embroiled
with
men
threats
of
war
and
revolution
punish
their
unfaithfulness
and
if
then
instead
of
retracing
their
steps
they
yield
again
and
are
driven
before
the
storm
the
very
arts
they
had
created
the
structures
they
had
raised
the
usages
they
had
established
are
swept
away
that
very
day
their
thoughts
perish
the
portion
they
had
reclaimed
from
the
young
ruggedness
is
lost
and
failing
to
stand
fast
against
man
they
finally
get
embroiled
with
nature
and
are
thrust
down
beneath
her
hand

the
dependence
of
man
upon
the
aid
of
spontaneous
nature
in
his
most
arduous
material
works
is
curiously
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
one
of
the
most
serious
difficulties
to
be
encountered
in
executing
the
proposed
gigantic
scheme
of
draining
the
zuiderzee
in

is
that
of
procuring
brushwood

the
force

is
from
one
and
a
half
to
two
tons
to
the
square
foot
and
stevenson
in

instance
at

found
this
force
equal
to
three
tons
per

the
seaward
front
of
the
breakwater
at
cherbourg
exposes
a
surface
of
about
square
feet
in
rough
weather
the
waves
beat
against
this
whole
face
though
at
the
depth
of
yards
which
is
the
height
of
the
breakwater
they
exert
a
very
much
less
violent
motive
force
than
at
and
near
the
surface
of
the
sea
because
this
force
diminishes
in
geometrical
as
the
distance
below
the
surface
increases
in
arithmetical
proportion
the
shock
of
the
waves
is
received
several
thousand
times
in
the
course
of
hours
and
hence
the
sum
of
impulse
which
the
breakwater
resists
in
one
stormy
day
amounts
to
many
thousands
of
millions
of
tons
the

entirely
an
artificial
construction

then
man
could
accumulate
and
control
the
forces

he
is
able
effectually
to
resist
he
might
be
said
to

that
it

the
character
of
geological
formation
is
an
element
of
very
great
importance
in
determining
the
amount
of

produced

and
of
course
in
measuring
the
consequences
of
clearing
off
the

the
soil
of
the
french

very
readily
to
the
force
of
currents
and
the
declivities
of
the
northern
apennines
are
covered
with
earth
which
becomes
itself
a
fluid
when
saturated
with
water
hence
the
erosion
of
such
surfaces
is
vastly
greater
than
on
many
other
mountains
of
equal
steepness
of
inclination
this
point
is
fully
considered
by
the
authors
referred

vacation
excursions
in
the
northern
states
of
the

union
though
presenting
few
instrumental
measurements
or
tabulated
results
are
of
value
for
the
powers
of
observation
they
exhibit
and
for
the
sound
common
sense
with
which
many
natural
phenomena
such
for
instance
as
the
formation
of
the
river
meadows
called
intervales
in
new
england
are
explained
they
present
a
true
and
interesting
picture
of
physical
conditions
many
of
which
have
long
ceased
to
exist
in
the
theatre
of

researches
and
of
which
few
other
records
are
extant
the
general
law
of
temperature
is
that
it
decreases
as
we
ascend
but
in
hilly
regions
the
law
is
reversed
in
cold
still
weather
the
cold
air
descending
by
reason
of
its
greater
gravity
into
the

there
be

not
take

these
facts
have
long
been
familiar
to
the

people
of

of

their
importance
has
not
been
sufficiently
taken
into
account
in
the
discussion

the

shall
harm
no

of

to
the
dangers
which
threaten
the
great

not

defy

too
often
corrupted

similar
evils
have
become
almost
equally
rife

than
those
of

to
be
ascribed
more
to
the
influence
of

companies
to
the
workings
in

of
what
is
called
the

too
much
though
unhappily
too
truly
spoken
of
many
countries
and
perhaps
in
some
aspects
true
of
all
has
done
much
mischief
whenever
it
has
been
too
unconditionally
accepted
as
a
political
axiom
the
popular
apprehension
of
being
and
i
am
afraid
more
emphatically
the
fear
of
being
has
had
much
to
do
with
the
general
abandonment
of
certain
governmental
duties
by
the
ruling
powers
of
most
modern
states
it
is
theoretically
the
duty
of
government
to
provide
all
those
public
facilities
of
intercommunication
and
commerce
which
are
essential
to
the
prosperity
of
civilized
commonwealths
but
which
individual
means
are
inadequate
to
furnish
and
for
the
due
administration
of
which
individual
guaranties
are
insufficient
hence
public
roads
canals
railroads
postal
communications
the
circulating
medium
of

whether
metallic
or
representative
armies
navies
being
all
matters
in
which
the
nation
at
large
has
a
vastly
deeper
interest
than
any
private
association
can
have
ought
legitimately
to
be
constructed
and
provided
only
by
that
which
is
the
visible
personification
and
embodiment
of
the
nation
namely
its
legislative
head
no
doubt
the
organization
and
management
of
these
institutions
by
government
are
liable
as
are
all
things
human
to
great
abuses
the
multiplication
of
public
placeholders
which
they
imply
is
a
serious
evil
but
the
corruption
thus
engendered
foul
as
it
is
does
not
strike
so
deep
as
the
rottenness
of
private
corporations
and
official
rank
position
and
duty
have
in
practice
proved
better
securities
for
fidelity
and
pecuniary
integrity
in
the
conduct
of
the
interests
in
question
than
the
suretyships
of
private
corporate
agents
whose
bondsmen
so
often
fail
or
abscond
before
their
principal
is
detected
many
theoretical
statesmen
have
thought
that
voluntary
associations
for
strictly
pecuniary
and
industrial
purposes
and
for
the
construction
and
control
of
public
works
might
furnish
in
democratic
countries
a
compensation
for
the
small
and
doubtful
advantages
and
at
the
same
time
secure
an
exemption
from
the
great
and
certain
evils
of
aristocratic
institutions
the
example
of
the
american
states
shows
that
private
corporations
whose
rule
of
action
is
the
interest
of
the
association
not
the
conscience
of
the
individual
though
composed
of
elements
may
become
most
dangerous
enemies
to
rational
liberty
to
the
moral
interests
of
the
commonwealth
to
the
purity
of
legislation
and
of
judicial
action
and
to
the
sacredness
of
private
rights
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
far
the
abstraction
of
water
from
the
earth
by
field
and
garden
plants
such
as
maize
the
gourd
family
the
cabbage
is
compensated
by
the
condensation
of
dew
which
sometimes
pours
from
them
in
a
stream
by
the
exhalation
of
aqueous
vapor
from
their
leaves
which
is
directly
absorbed
by
the
ground
and
by
the
shelter
they
afford
the
soil
from
sun
and
wind
thus
preventing
evaporation
american
farmers
often
say
that
after
the
leaves
of
indian
corn
are
large
enough
to
shade
the
ground
there
is
little
danger
that
the
plants
will
suffer
from
drought
but
it
is
probable
that
the
comparative
security
of
the
fields
from
this
evil
is
in
part
due
to
the
fact
that
at
this
period
of
growth
the
roots
penetrate
down
to
a
permanently
humid
stratum
of
soil
and
draw
from
it
the
moisture
they
require
stirring
the
ground
between
the
rows
of
maize
with
a
light
harrow
or
cultivator
in
very
dry
seasons
is
often
recommended
as
a
preventive
of
injury
by
drought
it
would
seem
indeed
that
loosening
and
turning
over
the
surface
earth
might
aggravate
the
evil
by
promoting
the
evaporation
of
the
little
remaining
moisture
but
the
practice
is
founded
partly
on
the
belief
that
the
hygroscopicity
of
the
soil
is
increased
by
it
to
such
a
degree
that
it
gains
more
by
absorption
than
it
loses
by
evaporation
and
partly
on
the
doctrine
that
to
admit
air
to
the
rootlets
or
at
least
to
the
earth
near
them
is
to
supply
directly

that
the
walls
of
one
of

are
singularly
enough
decorated
with
landscape
paintings
a
grove
of
palm
and
trees
with
fruits
and
birds
on
the
branches
the
colors
all
as
fresh
and
lively
as
if
painted
yesterday
the
writer
remarks
on
the
character
of
this
decoration
as
something
very
unusual
in
roman
architecture
and
if
the
trees
in
question
are
really
orange
and
not
lemon
trees
this
circumstance
may
throw
some
doubt
on
the
antiquity
of
the
painting
if
on
the
other
hand
it
proves
really
ancient
it
shows
that
the
orange
was
known
to
the
roman
painters
if
not
gardeners
the
landscape
may
perhaps
represent
oriental
not
european
scenery
the

of
almost
any
geological
character

their

vegetate
only
in
artificially
prepared
ground
they
have
little
power
and
they
soon
perish

the
nursing

of
man
is
withdrawn
from
them

more
limited
than

but
much
less
so
with

they
germinate
and
grow
see
no

remarks
that
the

of

will
not
vegetate

this
is
one
of
the
very
few

there
is

is
no

reason
for
believing
that
it

any
extent

there
were
any
special
motive
for
encouraging
its

whether
in

the

a

in

has
been
observed
in
numerous
localities
in
southern
europe
as
well
as
in

this
change
has
been
thought
to
favor
the
multiplication
of
the
obscure
parasites
which
cause
the
injury
to
the
vegetables
just
mentioned
babinet
supposes
the
parasites
which
attack
the
grape
and
the
potato
to
be
animal
not
vegetable
and
he
ascribes
their
multiplication
to
excessive
manuring
and
stimulation
of
the
growth
of
the
plants
on
which
they
live
they
are
now
generally
if
not
universally
regarded
as
vegetable
and
if
they
are
so
babinet
theory
would
be
even
more
plausible
than
on
his
own

it
is
a
fact
of
some
interest
in
agricultural
economy
that
the
oidium
which
is

destructive
to

produced
no
pecuniary
loss
to
the
proprietors
of

the
price
of
wine
says
lavergne
has
quintupled
and
as
the
product
of
the

has
not
diminished
in
the
same
proportion
the
crisis
has
been
on
the
whole
rather
advantageous
than
detrimental
to
the

france
produces
a
considerable
surplus
of

for
exportation
and
the
sales
to

are
the
principal
source
of

to
french
vinegrowers
in

italy
on
the
contrary
which

there
has
been
no
such
increase
in
the
price
of

as
to
compensate
the
great
diminution
in
the

and
the
loss
of
this

is
severely
felt
in

waltershausen
informs
us
that
in

a

for

use
but
sicily
has
received
a
compensation
in
the
immense
increase
which
it
has
occasioned
in
both
the
product
and
the
profits
of
the

flour
of

is
applied
to
the

as
a
remedy
against
the

and
the
operation
is
repeated
from
two
to

or
four
and
even
it
is
said
eight

ten
times
in
a

hence
there
is
a
great
demand
for
sulphur
in
all
the
countries
of

waltershausen
estimates
the
annual
consumption
of
that
mineral
for
this
single
purpose
at
or
more
than
forty

the

and
its

is
i

not

the

a

he

of

the
adams
of
modern
botany

have
been
put
to
hard
shifts
in
finding
names
for
the
multiplied
organisms
which
the
creator
has
brought
before
them
to
see
what
they
would
call
them
and
naturalists
and
philosophers
have
shown
much
moral
courage
in
setting
at
naught
the
laws
of
philology
in
the
coinage
of
uncouth
words
to
express
scientific
ideas
it
is
much
to
be
wished
that
some
bold
neologist
would
devise
english
technical
equivalents
for
the
german
and
improved
by
cultivation
could
the
bones
and
other
relics
of
the
domestic
quadrupeds
destroyed
by
disease
or
slaughtered
for
human
use
in
civilized
countries
be
collected
into
large
deposits
as
obscure
causes
have
gathered
together
those
of
extinct
animals
they
would
soon
form
aggregations
which
might
almost
be
called
mountains
there
were
in
the
united
states
in
as
we
shall
see
hereafter
nearly
one
hundred
and
two
millions
of
horses
black
cattle
sheep
and
swine
there
are
great
numbers
of
all
the
same
animals
in
the
british
american
provinces
and
in
mexico
and
there
are
large
herds
of
wild
horses
on
the
plains
and
of
tamed
among
the
independent
indian
tribes
of
north
america
it
would
perhaps
not
be
extravagant
to
suppose
that
all
those
cattle
may
amount
to
two
thirds
as
many
as
those
of
the
united
states
and
thus
we
have
in
north
america
a
total
of
domestic
quadrupeds
belonging
to
species
introduced
by
european
colonization
besides
dogs
cats
and
other
household
pets
and
pests
also
of
foreign
origin
if
we
allow
half
a
solid
foot
to
the
skeleton
and
other
slowly
destructible
parts
of
each
animal
the
remains
of
these
herds
would
form
a
cubical
mass
measuring
not
much
short
of
four
hundred
and
fifty
feet
to
the
side
or
a
pyramid
equal
in
dimensions
to
that
of
cheops
and
as
the
average
life
of
these
animals
does
not
exceed
six
or
seven
years
the
accumulations
of
their
bones
horns
hoofs
and
other
durable
remains
would
amount
to
at
least
fifteen
times
as
great
a
volume
in
a
single
century
it
is
true
that
the
actual
mass
of
solid
matter
left
by
the
decay
of
dead
domestic
quadrupeds
and
permanently
added
to
the
crust
of
the
earth
is
not
so
great
as
this
calculation
makes
it
the
greatest
proportion
of
the
soft
parts
of
domestic
animals
and
even
of
the
bones
is
soon
decomposed
through
direct
consumption
by
man
and
other
carnivora
industrial
use
and
employment
as
manure
and
enters
into
new
combinations
in
which
its
animal
origin
is
scarcely
traceable
there
is
nevertheless
a
large
annual
residuum
which
like
decayed
vegetable
matter
becomes
a
part
of
the
superficial
mould
and
in
any
event
brute
life
immensely
changes
the
form
and
character
of
the
superficial
strata
if
it
does
not
sensibly
augment
the
quantity
of
the
matter
composing
them
the
remains
of
man
too
add
to
the
earthy
coating
that
covers
the
face
of
the
globe
the
human
bodies
deposited
in
the
catacombs
during
the
long
long
ages
of
egyptian
history
would
perhaps
build
as
large
a
pile
as
one
generation
of
the
quadrupeds
of
the
united
states
in
the
barbarous
days
of
old
moslem
warfare
the
conquerors
erected
large
pyramids
of
human
skulls
the
soil
of
cemeteries
in
the
great
cities
of
europe
has
sometimes
been
raised
several
feet
by
the
deposit
of
the
dead
during
a
few
generations
in
the
east
turks
and
christians
alike
bury
bodies
but
a
couple
of
feet
beneath
the
surface
the
grave
is
respected
as
long
as
the
tombstone
remains
but
the
sepultures
of
the
ignoble
poor
and
of
those
whose
monuments
time
or
accident
has
removed
are
opened
again
and
again
to
receive
fresh
occupants
hence
the
ground
in
oriental
cemeteries
is
pervaded
with
relics
of
humanity
if
not
wholly
composed
of
them
and
an
examination
of
the
soil
of
the
lower
part
of
the
champ
des
at
pera
by
the
naked
eye
alone
shows
the
observer
that
it
consists
almost
exclusively
of
the
comminuted
bones
of
his
fellow
man
it
is
asserted
that
the
bones
of
mammoths
and
mastodons
in
many
instances
appear
to
have
been
grazed
or
cut
by
flint
or
other
stone
weapons
these
accounts
have
often
been
discredited
because
it
has
been
assumed
that
the
extinction
of
these
animals
was
more
ancient
than
the
existence
of
man
recent
discoveries
render
it
highly
probable
if
not
certain
that
this
conclusion
has
been
too
hastily
adopted
lyell
observes
these
stories
must
in
future
be
more
carefully
inquired
into
for
we
can
scarcely
doubt
that
the
mastodon
in
north
america
lived
down
to
a
period
when
the
mammoth
coexisted
with
man
in
europe
of
on
page
of
the
volume
just
quoted
the
same
very
distinguished
writer
remarks
that
man
no
doubt
played
his
part
in
hastening
the
era
of
the
extinction
of
the
large
pachyderms
and
beasts
of
prey
but
as
contemporaneous
species
of
other
animals
which
man
can
not
be
supposed
to
have
extirpated
have
also
become
extinct
he
argues
that
the
disappearance
of
the
quadrupeds
in
question
can
not
be
ascribed
to
human
action
alone
on
this
point
it
may
be
observed
that
as
we
can
not
know
what
precise
physical
conditions
were
necessary
to
the
existence
of
a
given
extinct
organism
we
can
not
say
how
far
such
conditions
may
have
been
modified
by
the
action
of
man
and
he
may
therefore
have
influenced
the
life
of
such
organisms
in
ways
and
to
an
extent
of
which
we
can
form
no
just
idea
evelyn
thought
the
depasturing
of
grass
by
cattle
serviceable
to
its

the
biting
of
cattle
he
remarks
gives
a
gentle
loosening
to
the
roots
of
the
herbage
and
makes
it
to
grow
fine
and
sweet

their
very

well
as

have
consequently
much
extended
their

increased
their
numbers

from
a
story
of
heliogabalus
related
by

would
seem
that
mice
at

were
not

oxen

for
hauling
timber

firewood

full

rocks
stumps

roots
for
breaking
up
the

its
strong
matting
of
native
grasses

for
the
transportation
of
heavy

the
rough

in
all
these
cases
the
frequent
obstructions
to
the
passage
of

the
plough
and
the

are
a
source
of
constant
danger
to
the
animals
the
vehicles
and
the
harness
and
the
slow
and
steady
step
of
the
ox
is
attended
with
much
less
risk
than
the
swift
and
sudden
movements
of

to
see
the
sagacity
with
which
the

had
previously
starved
upon
a
daily
allowance
of
eight
or
ten
worms
or
about
twenty
per
cent
of
his
own
weight
the
largest
of
these
numbers
appeared
so
far
as
could
be
judged
by
watching
parent
birds
of
the
same
species
as
they
brought
food
to
their
young
to
be
much
greater
than
that
supplied
to
them
when
fed
in
the
nest
for
the
old
birds
did
not
return
with
worms
or
insects
oftener
than
once
in
ten
minutes
on
an
average
if
we
suppose
the
parents
to
hunt
for
food
twelve
hours
in
a
day
and
a
nest
to
contain
four
young
we
should
have
worms
or
eighteen
each
as
the
daily
supply
of
the
brood
it
is
probable
enough
that
some
of
the
food
collected
by
the
parents
may
be
more
nutritious
than
the
earthworms
and
consequently
that
a
smaller
quantity
sufficed
for
the
young
in
the
nest
than
when
reared
under
artificial
conditions
the
supply
required
by
growing
birds
is
not
the
measure
of
their
wants
after
they
have
arrived
at
maturity
and
it
is
not
by
any
means
certain
that
great
muscular
exertion
always
increases
the
demand
for
nourishment
either
in
the
lower
animals
or
in
man
the
members
of
the
english
alpine
club
are
not
distinguished
for
appetites
which
would
make
them
unwelcome
guests
to
swiss
landlords
and
i
think
every
man
who
has
had
the
personal
charge
of
field
or
railway
hands
must
have
observed
that
laborers
who
spare
their
strength
the
least
are
not
the
most
valiant
trencher
champions
during
the
period
when
imprisonment
for
debt
was
permitted
in
new
england
persons
confined
in
country
jails
had
no
specific
allowance
and
they
were
commonly
fed
without
stint
i
have
often
inquired
concerning
their
diet
and
been
assured
by
the
jailers
that
their
prisoners
who
were
not
provided
with
work
or
other
means
of
exercise
consumed
a
considerably
larger
supply
of
food
than
common
laborers
i

michelet

good
authority
for
this
statement

i
am
unable
to
confirm
it
apropos
of
the

some
years
since

for

more
than
a
hundred
dead

of

water

at

had
been
killed
in

night

see
no
migrating
birds
whether
for
greater
security
from
eagles
hawks
and
other
enemies
or
for
some
unknown
reason
perform
a
great
part
of
their
annual
journeys
by
night
and
it
is
observed
in
the
alps
that
they
follow
the
high
roads
in
their
passage
across
the
mountains
this
is
partly
because
the
food
in
search
of
which
they
must
sometimes
descend
is
principally
found
near
the
roads
it
is
however
not
altogether
for
the
sake
of
consorting
with
man
or
of
profiting
by
his
labors
that
their
line
of
flight
conforms
to
the
paths
he
has
traced
but
rather
because
the
great
roads
are
carried
through
the
natural
depressions
in
the
chain
and
hence
the
birds
can
cross
the
summit
by
these
routes
without
rising
to
a
height
where
at
the
seasons
of
migration
the
cold
would
be
excessive
the
instinct
which
guides
migratory
birds
in
their
course
is
not
in
all
cases
infallible
and
it
seems
to
be
confounded
by
changes
in
the
condition
of
the
surface
i
am
familiar
with
a
village
in
new
england
at
the
junction
of
two
valleys
each
drained
by
a
mill
stream
where
the
flocks
of
wild
geese
which
formerly
passed
every
spring
and
autumn
were
very
frequently
lost
as
it
was
popularly
phrased
and
i
have
often
heard
their
screams
in
the
night
as
they
flew
wildly
about
in
perplexity
as
to
the
proper
course
perhaps
the
village
lights
embarrassed
them
or
perhaps
the
constant
changes
in
the
face
of
the
country
from
the
clearings
then
going
on
introduced
into
the
landscape
features
not
according
with
the
ideal
map
handed
down
in
the
anserine
family
and
thus
deranged
its
traditional
geography
the
cappercailzie
or
tjäder
as
he
is
called
in
sweden
is
a
bird
of
singular
habits
and
seems
to
want
some
of
the
protective
instincts
which
secure
most
other
wild
birds
from
destruction
the
younger
læstadius
frequently
notices
the
tjäder
in
his
very
remarkable
account
of
the
swedish
laplanders
a
work
wholly
unsurpassed
as
a
genial
picture
of
life
and
not
inferior
in
minuteness
of
detail
to

of
the
manners
of
the

or
even

admirable
and
exhaustive
work
on
the
modern
egyptians
the
tjäder
though
not
a
bird
of
passage
is
migratory
or
rather
wandering
in
domicile
and
appears
to
undertake
very
purposeless
and
absurd
journeys
when
he
flits
says
læstadius
he
follows
a
straight
course
and
sometimes
pursues
it
quite
out
of
the
country
it
is
said
that
in
foggy
weather
he
sometimes
flies
out
to
sea
and
when
tired
falls
into
the
water
and
is
drowned
it
is
accordingly
observed
that
when
he
flies
westwardly
toward
the
mountains
he
soon
comes
back
again
but
when
he
takes
an
eastwardly
course
he
returns
no
more
and
for
a
long
time
is
very
scarce
in
lapland
from
this
it
would
seem
that
he
turns
back
from
the
bald
mountains
when
he
discovers
that
he
has
strayed
from
his
proper
home
the
wood
but
when
he
finds
himself
over
the
baltic
where
he
can
not
alight
to
rest
and
collect
himself
he
flies
on
until
he
is
exhausted
and
falls
into
the
sea

the
fact
that
the
gulls
were
far
more
numerous
about
the
ships
of
one
of
the
fleets
than
about
the
others
this
was
verified
by
repeated
observation
and
the
difference
was
owing
no
doubt
to
the
greater
abundance
of
the
refuse
from
the

delicate

birds
do
not
often
voluntarily
take
passage
on
board
ships
bound
for
foreign
countries
but
i
can
testify
to
one
such
case
a
stork
which
had
nested
near
one
of
the
palaces
on
the
bosphorus
had
by
some
accident
injured
a
wing
and
was
unable
to
join
his
follows
when
they
commenced
their
winter
migration
to
the
banks
of
the
nile
before
he
was
able
to
fly
again
he
was
caught
and
the
flag
of
the
nation
to
which
the
palace
belonged
was
tied
to
his
leg
so
that
he
was
easily
identified
at
a
considerable
distance
as
his
wing
grow
stronger
he
made
several
unsatisfactory
experiments
at
flight
and
at
last
by
a
vigorous
effort
succeeded
in
reaching
a
passing
ship
bound
southward
and
perched
himself
on
a
topsail
yard
i
happened
to
witness
this
movement
and
observed
him
quietly
maintaining
his
position
as
long
as
i
could
discern
him
with
a
spyglass
i
suppose
he
finished
the
voyage
for
he
certainly
did
not
return
to
the
palace
the

of

multiply
very
rapidly
after
the
soil
is
brought
under
cultivation
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
they
were
so
scarce
in
the
newer
parts
of
new
england
that
the
rustic
fishermen
of
every
village
kept
secret
the
few
places
where
they
were
to
be
found
in
their
neighborhood
as
a
professional
mystery
but
at
present
one
can
hardly
turn
over
a
shovelful
of
rich
moist
soil
anywhere
without
unearthing
several
of
them
a
very
intelligent
lady
born
in
the
woods
of
northern
new
england
told
me
that
in
her
childhood
these
worms
were
almost
unknown
in
that
region
though
anxiously
sought
for
by
the
anglers
but
that
they
increased
as
the
country
was
cleared
and
at
last
became
so
numerous
in
some
places
that
the
water
of
springs
and
even
of
shallow
wells
which
had
formerly
been
excellent
was
rendered
undrinkable
by
the
quantity
of
dead
worms
that
fell
into
them
the
increase
of
the
robin
and
other
small
birds
which
follow
the
settler
when
he
has
prepared
a
suitable
home
for
them
at
last
checked
the
excessive
multiplication
of
the
worms
and
abated
the
nuisance
i
have
already
remarked
that
the
remains
of
extant
animals
are
rarely
if
ever
gathered
in
sufficient
quantities
to
possess
any
geographical
importance
by
their
mere
mass
but
the
decayed
exuviæ
of
even
the
smaller
and
humbler
forms
of
life
are
sometimes
abundant
enough
to
exercise
a
perceptible
influence
on
soil
and
atmosphere
the
plain
of
cumana
says
humboldt
presents
a
remarkable
phenomenon
after
heavy
rains
the
moistened
earth
when
heated
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
diffuses
the
musky
odor
common
in
the
torrid
zone
to
animals
of
very
different
classes
to
the
jaguar
the
small
species
of
tiger
cat
the
cabiaï
the
gallinazo
vulture
the
crocodile
the
viper
and
the
rattlesnake
the
gaseous
emanations
the
vehicles
of
this
aroma
appear
to
be
disengaged
in
proportion
as
the
soil
which
contains
the
remains
of
an
innumerable
multitude
of
reptiles
worms
and
insects
begins
to
be
impregnated
with
water
wherever
we
stir
the
earth
we
are
struck
with
the
mass
of
organic
substances
which
in
turn
are
developed
and
become
transformed
or
decomposed
nature
in
these
climes
seems
more
active
more
prolific
and
so
to
speak
more
prodigal
of
life
it
is
remarkable
that
palissy
to
whose
great
merits
as
an
acute
observer
i
am
happy
to
have
frequent
occasion
to
bear
testimony
had
noticed
that
vegetation
was
necessary
to
maintain
the
purity
of
water
in
artificial
reservoirs
though
he
mistook
the
rationale
of
its
influence
which
he
ascribed
to
the
elemental
salt
supposed
by
him
to
play
an
important
part
in
all
the
operations
of
nature
in
his
treatise
upon
waters
and
fountains
of
the
reprint
of
he
says
and
in
special
thou
shalt
note
one
point
the
which
is
understood
of
few
that
is
to
say
that
the
leaves
of
the
trees
which
fall
upon
the
parterre
and
the
herbs
growing
beneath
and
singularly
the
fruits
if
any
there
be
upon
the
trees
being
decayed
the
waters
of
the
parterre
shall
draw
unto
them
the
salt
of
the
said
fruits
leaves
and
herbs
the
which
shall
greatly
better
the

an

had
emerged
into

to
be
about
two
inches
in
length
nearly
horizontal
and
inclining
upward
very
little
except
at
the
mouth
between
the
hole
and
the
outside
of

of

there
were
forty
grains

that
the

must
have
removed
at

thirteen
grains
more

the
table
had
been
in

from

popularly
grouped
under

from
the
narrative
of
ohther
introduced
by
king
alfred
into
his
translation
of
orosius
it
is
clear
that
the
northmen
pursued
the
whale
fishery
in
the
ninth
century
and
it
appears
both
from
the
poem
called
the

in

exoniensis

from
the
dialogue
with
the

in

followed
this
dangerous
chase
at

period
not
much
later
i
am
not
aware
of
any
evidence
to
show
that
any
of
the
latin
nations
engaged
in
this
fishery
until
a
century
or
two
afterward
though
it
may
not
be
easy
to
disprove
their
earlier
participation
in
it
in
mediæval
literature

and

frequent
mention
is
made

a
species
of
vessel
called
in

in
catalan

all
of
which
words
occur
in
many
other
forms
the
most
obvious
etymology
of
these
words
would
suggest
the
meaning
but
some
have
supposed
that
the
name
was
descriptive
of
the
great
size
of
the
ships
and
others
have
referred
it
to
a
different
root
from
the
fourteenth
century
the
word
occurs
oftener
perhaps
in
old
catalan
than
in
any
other
language
but
capmany
does
not
notice
the
whale
fishery
as
one
of
the
maritime
pursuits
of
the
very
enterprising
catalan
people
nor
do
i
find
any
of
the
products

the

mentioned
in

old
catalan

writers
which
is
described
as
very
white

doubtless
the
ivory
of
the
walrus
or
of
the
narwhale

of
the
great

the

much
used

the

is
little
creditable
to

it
is
painful
to
reflect
that
it
becomes
keener
and
more
unsparing
in
proportion
to
the
refinement
of
the

the
savage
slays
no

the

i
have
found
it
very
difficult
to
induce
even
the

to
catch
lizards

other
reptiles
for
preservation
as
specimens
see
no
the
fearless
confidence
in
man
so
generally
manifested
by
wild
animals
in
newly
discovered
islands
ought
to
have
inspired
a
gentler
treatment
of
them
but
a
very
few
years
of
the
relentless
pursuit
to
which
they
are
immediately
subjected
suffice
to
make
them
as
timid
as
the
wildest
inhabitants
of
the
european
forest
this
timidity
however
may
easily
be
overcome
the

so
tame

fact

the

well
known

is
important
as
showing
that
the
diminution
of
the
fish
in
rivers
exposed
to
inundations
is
chiefly
to
be
ascribed
to
the
mechanical
action
of
the
current
and
not
mainly
as
some
have
supposed
to
changes
of
temperature
occasioned

it

is
matter
of
dispute

there

cases
in

out
to

rarely

ever
numerous
enough
in
regions
uninhabited
by
man
to
produce
any
sensible
effect
on
the
condition
of

a
reason
why
they
are
less
injurious
than
the
goat
to

may
be
that
they
resort
to
this
nutriment
only
in
the
winter
when
the
grasses
and
shrubs
are
leafless
or
covered
with
snow
whereas
the

feeds
upon
buds
and
young
shoots
principally
in

however
this
may
be
the
natural
law
of

keeps
the

growth
and
the
wild
animals
which
live
on
its
products
in
such
a
state
of
equilibrium
as
to
insure
the
indefinite
continuance
of
both

the

of
neither

who
is

the
balance
when
however
deer
are
bred
and
protected
in
parks
they
multiply
like
domestic
cattle

become
equally
injurious
to

a
few
years
ago
says
clavé
there
were
not
less
than
two
thousand
deer
of
different
ages
in
the
forest
of
fontainebleau
for
want
of
grass
they
are
driven
to
the
trees
and
they
do
not
spare
them
it
is
calculated
that
the
browsing
of
these
animals
and
the
consequent
retardation
of
the
growth
of
the
wood
diminishes
the
annual
product
of
the

to
the
amount
of
two
hundred
thousand
cubic
feet
per
year
and
besides
this
the

thus
mutilated
are

but
the

us
presents
man
in

as
inhabiting
only
the

of
the

and
the

grounds
that
skirt
the
waters
and
the
woods
and
as
finding
only
there
the
aliments
which
make
up
his
daily
bread
the
origin
of
the
great
natural
meadows
or
prairies
as
they
are
called
of
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
is
obscure
there
is
of
course
no
historical
evidence
on
the
subject
and
i
believe
that
remains
of
forest
vegetation
are
seldom
or
never
found
beneath
the
surface
even
in
the
where
the
perpetual
moisture
would
preserve
such
remains
indefinitely
the
want
of
trees
upon
them
has
been
ascribed
to
the
occasional
droughts
of
summer
and
the
excessive
humidity
of
the
soil
in
winter
but
it
is
in
very
many
instances
certain
that
by
whatever
means
the
growth
of
forests
upon
them
was
first
prevented
or
destroyed
the
trees
have
been
since
kept
out
of
them
only
by
the
annual
burning
of
the
grass
by
grazing
animals
or
by
cultivation
the
groves
and
belts
of
trees
which
are
found
upon
the
prairies
though
their
seedlings
are
occasionally
killed
by
drought
or
by
excess
of
moisture
extend
themselves
rapidly
over
them
when
the
seeds
and
shoots
are
protected
against
fire
cattle
and
the
plough
the
prairies
though
of
vast
extent
must
be
considered
as
a
local
and
so
far
as
our
present
knowledge
extends
abnormal
exception
to
the
law
which
clothes
all
suitable
surfaces
with
forest
for
there
are
many
parts
of
the
united
states
ohio
for
example
where
the
physical
conditions
appear
to
be
nearly
identical
with
those
of
the
states
lying
farther
west
but
where
there
were
comparatively
few
natural
meadows
the
prairies
were
the
proper
feeding
grounds
of
the
bison
and
the
vast
number
of
those
animals
is
connected
as
cause
or
consequence
with
the
existence
of
those
vast
pastures
the
bison
indeed
could
not
convert
the
forest
into
a
pasture
but
he
would
do
much
to
prevent
the
pasture
from
becoming
a
forest
there
is
positive
evidence
that
some
of
the
american
tribes
possessed
large
herds
of
domesticated
bisons
see
humboldt
der
i
pp
what
authorizes
us
to
affirm
that
this
was
simply
the
wild
bison
reclaimed
and
why
may
we
not
with
equal
probability
believe
that
the
migratory
prairie
buffalo
is
the
progeny
of
the
domestic
animal
run
wild
there
are
both
on
the
prairies
as
in
wisconsin
and
in
deep
forests
as
in
ohio
extensive
remains
of
a
primitive
people
who
must
have
been
more
numerous
and
more
advanced
in
art
than
the
present
indian
tribes
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
woods
where
such
earthworks
are
found
in
ohio
were
cleared
by
them
and
that
the
vicinity
of
these
fortresses
or
temples
was
inhabited
by
a
large
population
nothing
forbids
the
supposition
that
the
prairies
were
cleared
by
the
same
or
a
similar
people
and
that
the
growth
of
trees
upon
them
has
been
prevented
by
fires
and
grazing
while
the
restoration
of
the
woods
in
ohio
may
be
due
to
the
abandonment
of
that
region
by
its
original
inhabitants
the
climatic
conditions
unfavorable
to
the
spontaneous
growth
of
trees
on
the
prairies
may
be
an
effect
of
too
extensive
clearings
rather
than
a
cause
of
the
want
of
woods
see
no
in
many
parts
of
the
north
american
states
the
first
white
settlers
found
extensive
tracts
of
thin
woods
of
a
very
character
called
oak
openings
from
the
predominance
of
different
species
of
that
tree
upon
them
these
were
the
pasture
grounds
of
the
indians
brought
into
that
state
and
so
kept
by
partial
clearing
and
by
the
annual
burning
of
the
grass
the
object
of
this
operation
was
to
attract
the
deer
to
the
fresh
herbage
which
sprang
up
after
the
fire
the
oaks
bore
the
annual
scorching
at
least
for
a
certain
time
but
if
it
had
been
indefinitely
continued
they
would
very
probably
have
been
destroyed
at
last
the
soil
would
have
then
been
much
in
the
prairie
condition
and
would
have
needed
nothing
but
grazing
for
a
long
succession
of
years
to
make
the
resemblance
perfect
that
the
annual
fires
alone
occasioned
the
peculiar
character
of
the
oak
openings
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
as
soon
as
the
indians
had
left
the
country
young
trees
of
many
species
sprang
up
and
grew
luxuriantly
upon
them

which
indeed

the
only

method
of
obtaining

from
the
soil
he
describes
but
as
we
shall
see
hereafter
it
is
regarded
by
most
writers
as
a
highly
pernicious
practice
the
remarkable
mounds
and
other
earthworks
constructed
in
the
valley
of
the
ohio
and
elsewhere
in
the
territory
of
the
united
states
by
a
people
apparently
more
advanced
in
culture
than
the
modern
indian
were
overgrown
with
a
dense
clothing
of
forest
when
first
discovered
by
the
whites
but
though
the
ground
where
they
were
erected
must
have
been
occupied
by
a
large
population
for
a
considerable
length
of
time
and
therefore
entirely
cleared
the
trees
which
grew
upon
the
ancient
fortresses
and
the
adjacent
lands
were
not
distinguishable
in
species
or
even
in
dimensions
and
character
of
growth
from
the
neighboring
forests
where
the
soil
seemed
never
to
have
been
disturbed
this
apparent
exception
to
the
law
of
change
of
crop
in
natural
forest
growth
was
ingeniously
explained
by
general
harrison
suggestion
that
the
lapse
of
time
since
the
era
of
the
mound
builders
was
so
great
as
to
have
embraced
several
successive
generations
of
trees
and
occasioned
by
their
rotation
a
return
to
the
original
vegetation
the
successive
changes
in
the
spontaneous
growth
of
the
forest
as
proved
by
the
character
of
the
wood
found
in
bogs
is
not
unfrequently
such
as
to
suggest
the
theory
of
a
considerable
change
of
climate
during
the
human
period
but
the
laws
which
govern
the
germination
and
growth
of
forest
trees
must
be
further
studied
and
the
primitive
local
conditions
of
the
sites
where
ancient
woods
lie
buried
must
be
better
ascertained
before
this
theory
can
be
admitted
upon
the
evidence
in
question
in
fact
the
order
of
succession
for
a
rotation
or
alternation
is
not
yet
proved
may
move
in
opposite
directions
in
different
countries
with
the
same
climate
and
at
the
same
time
thus
in
denmark
and
in
holland
the
firs
have
given
place
to
the
beech
while
in
northern
germany
the
process
has
been
reversed
and
evergreens
have
supplanted
the
oaks
and
birches
of
deciduous
foliage
the
principal
determining
cause
seems
to
be
the
influence
of
light
upon
the
germination
of
the
seeds
and
the
growth
of
the
young
tree
in
a
forest
of
firs
for
instance
the
distribution
of
the
light
and
shade
to
the
influence
of
which
seeds
and
shoots
are
exposed
is
by
no
means
the
same
as
in
a
wood
of
beeches
or
of
oaks
and
hence
the
growth
of
different
species
will
be
stimulated

scale
with
more
perfect
electrical
conductors
consisting
of
poles
secured
to
the
top
of
tall
trees
and
provided
with
a
pointed
wire
entering
the
ground
and
reaching
above
the
top
of
the
pole
it
was
at
first
thought
that
this
apparatus
erected
at
numerous
points
over
an
extent
of
several
miles
was
of
some
service
as
a
protection
against
hail
but
this
opinion
was
soon
disputed
and
does
not
appear
to
be
supported
by
facts
the
question
of
a
repetition
of
the
experiment
over
a
wide
area
has
been
again
agitated
within
a
very
few
years
in
lombardy
but
the
doubts
expressed
by
very
able
physicists
as
to
its
efficacy
and
as
to
the
point
whether
hail
is
an
electrical
phenomenon
have

much

in

the

upon

experience
has
proved
says
becquerel
that
when
the

is
bared
it
becomes
more
or
less
heated
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
according
to
the
nature
and
the
color
of
the
particles
which
compose
it
and
according
to
its

and
that
in
the

from

we
must
take
into
the
account
the
conducting

with

with

earth
are
the
soils
which
least
conduct

it
is
for
this
reason
that
sandy
ground
in

maintains
a
high
temperature
even
during
the
night
we
may
hence
conclude
that
when
a
sandy
soil
is
stripped
of
wood
the
local
temperature
will
be
raised
after
the
sands
follow
successively
argillaceous
arable

then
humus

occupies
the

the

of

then
is

we
will
add
that
the
power
of

is
proportional
to
the
density
it
has
also
a
relation
to
the
magnitude
of
the

it
is
for
this
reason
that
ground
covered
with
silicious
pebbles
cools
more
slowly
than
silicious
sand
and
that
pebbly
soils
are
best
suited
to
the

the

they
advance
the

two

passing

which
would
vaporize
them
if
they
were
in

state
of
more
minute
division
it
is
perhaps
too
much
to
say
that
the
influence
of
trees
upon
the
wind
is
strictly
limited
to
the
mechanical
resistance
of
their
trunks
branches
and
foliage
so
far
as
the
forest
by
dead
or
by
living
action
raises
or
lowers
the
temperature
of
the
air
within
it
so
far
it
creates
upward
or
downward
currents
in
the
atmosphere
above
it
and
consequently
a
flow
of
air
toward
or
from
itself
these
air
streams
have
a
certain
though
doubtless
a
very
small
influence
on
the
force
and
direction
of
greater
atmospheric
movements
as
a
familiar
illustration
of
the
influence
of
the
forest
in
checking
the
movement
of
winds
i
may
mention
the
fact
that
the
sensible
cold
is
never
extreme
in
thick
woods
where
the
motion
of
the
air
is
little
felt
the
lumbermen
in
canada
and
the
northern
united
states
labor
in
the
woods
without
inconvenience
when
the
mercury
stands
many
degrees
below
the
zero
of
fahrenheit
while
in
the
open
grounds
with
only
a
moderate
breeze
the
same
temperature
is
almost
insupportable
the
engineers
and
firemen
of
locomotives
employed
on
railways
running
through
forests
of
any
considerable
extent
observe
that
in
very
cold
weather
it
is
much
easier
to
keep
up
the
steam
while
the
engine
is
passing
through
the
woods
than
in
the
open
ground
as
soon
as
the
train
emerges
from
the
shelter
of
the
trees
the
steam
gauge
falls
and
the
stoker
is
obliged
to
throw
in
a
liberal
supply
of
fuel
to
bring
it
up
again
another
less
frequently
noticed
fact
due
no
doubt
in
a
great
measure
to
the
immobility
of
the
air
is
that
sounds
are
transmitted
to
incredible
distances
in
the
unbroken
forest
many
instances
of
this
have
fallen
under
my
own
observation
and
others
yet
more
striking
have
been
related
to
me
by
credible
and
competent
witnesses
familiar
with
a
more
primitive
condition
of
the
world
an
acute
observer
of
natural
phenomena
whose
childhood
and
youth
were
spent
in
the
interior
of
one
of
the
newer
new
england
states
has
often
told
me
that
when
he
established
his
home
in
the
forest
he
always
distinctly
heard
in
still
weather
the
plash
of
horses
feet
when
they
forded
a
small
brook
nearly
of
a
mile
from
his
house
though
a
portion
of
the
wood
that
intervened
consisted
of
a
ridge
seventy
or
eighty
feet
higher
than
either
the
house
or
the
ford
i
have
no
doubt
that
in
such
cases
the
stillness
of
the
air
is
the
most
important
element
in
the
extraordinary
transmissibility
of
sound
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
absence
of
the
multiplied
and
confused
noises
which
accompany
human
industry
in
countries
thickly
peopled
by
man
contributes
to
the
same
result
we
become
by
habit
almost
insensible
to
the
familiar
and
voices
of
civilization
in
cities
and
towns
but
the
indistinguishable
drone
which
sometimes
escapes
even
the
ear
of
him
who
listens
for
it
deadens
and
often
quite
obstructs
the
transmission
of
sounds
which
would
otherwise
be
clearly
audible
an
observer
who
wishes
to
appreciate
that
hum
of
civic
life
which
he
can
not
analyze
will
find
an
excellent
opportunity
by
placing
himself
on
the
hill
of
capo
di
monte
at
naples
in
the
line
of
prolongation
of
the
street
called
spaccanapoli
it
is
probably
to
the
stillness
of
which
i
have
spoken
that
we
are
to
ascribe
the
transmission
of
sound
to
great
distances
at
sea
in
calm
weather
in
june
i
and
my
family
were
passengers
on
board
a
ship
of
war
bound
up
the
ægean
on
the
evening
of
the
of
that
month
as
we
were
discussing
at
the
tea
table
some
observations
of
humboldt
on
this
subject
the
captain
of
the
ship
told
us
that
he
had
once
heard
a
single
gun
at
sea
at
the
distance
of
ninety
nautical
miles
the
nest
morning
though
a
light
breeze
had
sprung
up
from
the
north
the
sea
was
of
glassy
smoothness
when
we
went
on
deck
as
we
came
up
an
officer
told
us
that
he
had
heard
a
gun
at
sunrise
and
the
conversation
of
the
previous
evening
suggested
the
inquiry
whether
it
could
have
been
fired
from
the
combined
french
and
english
fleet
then
lying
at
beshika
bay
upon
examination
of
our
position
we
were
found
to
have
been
at
sunrise
ninety
sea
miles
from
that
point
we
continued
beating
up
northward
and
between
sunrise
and
twelve
meridian
of
the
we
had
made
twelve
miles
northing
reducing
our
distance
from
beshika
bay
to
sea
miles
at
noon
we
heard
several
guns
so
distinctly
that
we
were
able
to
count
the
number
on
the
we
came
up
with
the
fleet
and
learned
from
an
officer
who
came
on
board
that
a
royal
salute
had
been
fired
at
noon
on
the
in
honor
of
the
day
as
the
anniversary
of
the
queen
of
england
coronation
the
report
at
sunrise
was
evidently
the
morning
gun
those
at
noon
the
salute
such
cases
are
rare
because
the
sea
is
seldom
still
and
the
greek
kymatôn
anêrithmon
gelasma
rarely
silent
over
so
great
a
space
as
ninety
or
even
nautical
miles
i
apply
the
epithet
to
greek
gelasma
advisedly
i
am
convinced
that
æschylus
meant
the
audible
laugh
of
the
waves
which
is
indeed
of
multiplicity
not
the
visible
smile
of
the
sea
which
belonging
to
the
great
expanse
as
one
impersonation
is
single
though
like
the
human
smile
made
up
of
the
play
of
many
features
the
presence
of
watery
vapor
in
the

general
vegetable

endowed
with
the
power
of
absorbing
gases

and
also
no
doubt
the
various
soluble
bodies
which
are
presented
to
them
the
inhalation
of
humidity
is
carried
on
by
the
leaves
upon
a
large
scale
the
dew
of
a
cold
summer
night
revives
the
groves
and
the
meadows
and
a
single
shower
of
rain
suffices
to
refresh
the
verdure
of
a
forest
which
a
long
drought
had
parched

the
absorption
of
the
vapor
of

by

disputed
the
absorption
of
watery
vapor
by
the
leaves
of
plants
is
according
to
unger
experiments
inadmissible
wilhelm
boden
und
das
if
this
latter
view
is
correct
the
apparently
refreshing
effects
of
atmospheric
humidity
upon
vegetation
must
be
ascribed
to
moisture
absorbed
by
the
ground
from
the
air
and
supplied
to
the
roots
in
some
recent
experiments
by
sachs
a
porous
with
a
plant
growing
in
it
was
left
unwatered
until
the
earth
was
dry
and
the
plant
began
to
languish
the
pot
was
then
placed
in
a
glass
case
containing
air
which
was
kept
always
saturated
with
humidity
but
no
water
was
supplied
and
the
leaves
of
the
plant
were
exposed
to
the
open
atmosphere
the
soil
in
the
flower
pot
absorbed
from
the
air
moisture
enough
to
revive
the
foliage
and
keep
it
a
long
time
green
but
not
enough
to
promote
development
of
new
the
experiments
of
hales
and
others
on
the
absorption
and
exhalation
of
water
by
vegetables
are
of
the
highest
physiological
interest
but
observations
on
sunflowers
cabbages
hops
and
single
branches
of
isolated
trees
growing
in
artificially
prepared
soils
and
under
artificial
conditions
furnish
no
trustworthy
data
for
computing
the
quantity
of
water
received
and
given
off
by
the
natural
wood
in
the
primitive
forest
except
where
the
soil
is
too
wet
for
the
dense
growth
of
trees
the
ground
is
generally
too
thickly
covered
with
leaves
to
allow
much
room
for
ground
mosses
in
the
more
open
woods
of
europe
this
form
of
vegetation
is
more
frequent
as
indeed
are
many
other
small
plants
of
a
more
inviting
character

as
having

in

the
an
american
agricultural

states
that
twenty
gallons
of

were
drawn
in
eighteen
hours
from
a
single
maple
two
and
a
half
feet
in
diameter
in
the
town
of
warner
new
hampshire
and
the
truth
of
this
account
has
been
verified
by
personal
inquiry
made
in
my
behalf
this
tree
was
of
the
original
forest
growth
and
had
been
left
standing
when
the
ground
around
it
was
cleared
it
was
tapped
only
every
other
year
and
then
with
six
or
eight
incisions
williams
of
i
says
a
man
much
employed
in
making
maple
sugar
found
that
for
days
together
a
maple
tree
discharged
seven
and
a
half
gallons
per
day
an
intelligent
correspondent
of
much
experience
in
the
manufacture
of
maple
sugar
writes
me
that
a
maple
of
about
two
feet
in
diameter
standing
in
open
ground
tapped
with
four
incisions
has
for
several
seasons
generally
run
eight
gallons
per
day
in
fair
weather
he
speaks
of
a
very
large
tree
from
which
sixty
gallons
were
drawn
in
the
course
of
a
season
and
of
another
something
more
than
three
feet
through
which
made
pounds
of
wet
sugar
and
must
have
yielded
not
less
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
gallons
the
buds
of
the
maple
says
the
same
correspondent
do
not
start
till
toward
the
close
of
the
sugar
season
as
soon
as
they
begin
to
swell
the
sap
seems
less
sweet
and
the
sugar
made
from
it
is
of
a
darker
color
and
with
less
of
the
distinctive
maple
flavor
in
this
region
maples
are
usually
tapped
with
a
inch
bit
boring
to
the
depth
of
one
and
a
half
or
two
inches
in
the
smaller
trees
one
incision
only
is
made

in
those
of
eighteen
inches
in
diameter

of
larger
size
two
holes
in
a
tree
inches
in

of
the
circumference
and
of
the
area
of
section
tapping
does
not
check
the
growth
but
does
injure
the
quality
of
the
wood
of
maples
the
wood
of
trees
often
tapped
is
lighter
and
less
dense
than
that
of
trees
which
have
not
been
tapped
and
gives
less
heat
in
burning
no
difference
has
been
observed
in
the
starting
of
the
buds
of
tapped
and
untapped
trees
dr
rush
in
a
letter
to
jefferson
states
the
number
of
maples
fit
for
tapping
on
an
acre
at
from
thirty
to
fifty
this
observes
my
correspondent
is
correct
with
regard
to
the
original
growth
which
is
always
more
or
less
intermixed
with
other
trees
but
in
second
growth
composed
of
maples
alone
the
number
greatly
exceeds
this
i
have
had
the
maples
on
a
quarter
of
an
acre
which
i
thought
about
an
average
of
orchards
counted
the
number
was
found
to
be
of
which
were
ten
inches
or
more
in
diameter
and
of
course
large
enough
to
tap
this
gives
two
hundred
and
eight
trees
to
the
acre
one
hundred
and
of
which
were
of
proper
size
for
tapping
according
to
the
census
returns
the
quantity
of
maple
sugar
made
in
the
united
states
in
was
pounds
in
it
was
pounds
besides
gallons
of
molasses
the
cane
sugar
made
in
amounted
to
pounds

iv
the

product
of
louisiana

the
correspondent
already
referred
to
informs
me
that
a
black
birch
tapped
about
noon
with
two
incisions
was
found
the
next
morning
to
have
yielded
sixteen
gallons
williams
of
i
says
a
large
birch
tapped
in
the
spring
ran
at
the
rate
of
five
gallons
an
hour
when
first
tapped
eight
or
nine
days
after
it
was
found
to
run
at
the
rate
of
about
two
and
a
half
gallons
an
hour
and
at
the
end
of
fifteen
days
the
discharge
continued
in
nearly
the
same
quantity
the
sap
continued
to
flow
for
four
or
five
weeks
and
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
observers
that
it
must
have
yielded
as
much
as
sixty
barrels
gallons
the
best
state
of
weather
for
a
good
run
says
my
correspondent
is
clear
days
thawing
fast
in
the
daytime
and
freezing
well
at
night
with
a
gentle
west
or
northwest
wind
though
we
sometimes
have
clear
fine
thawing
days
followed
by
frosty
nights
without
a
good
run
of
sap
i
have
thought
it
probable
that
the
irregular
flow
of
sap
on
different
days
in
the
same
season
is
connected
with
the
variation
in
atmospheric
pressure
for
the
atmospheric
conditions
above
mentioned
as
those
most
favorable
to
a
free
flow
of
sap
are
also
those
in
which
the
barometer
usually
indicates
pressure
considerably
above
the
mean
with
a
south
or
southeast
wind
and
in
lowering
weather
which
causes
a
fall
in
the
barometer
the
flow
generally
ceases
though
the
sap
sometimes
runs
till
after
the
beginning
of
the
storm
with
a
wind
south
of
west
maples
sometimes
run
all
night
when
this
occurs
it
is
oftenest
shortly
before
a
storm
last
spring
the
sap
of
a
sugar
orchard
in
a
neighboring
town
flowed
the
greater
part
of
the
time
for
two
days
and
two
nights
successively
and
did
not
cease
till
after
the
commencement
of
a
rain
storm
the
cessation
of
the
flow
of
sap
at
night
is
perhaps
in
part
to
be
ascribed
to
the
nocturnal
frost
which
checks
the
melting
of
the
snow
of
course
diminishing
the
supply
of
moisture
in
the
ground
and
sometimes
congeals
the
strata
from
which
the
rootlets
suck
in
water
from
the
facts
already
mentioned
however
and
from
other
circumstances
such
for
example
as
the
more
liberal
flow
of
sap
from
incisions
on
the
south
side
of
the
trunk
it
is
evident
that
the
withdrawal
of
the
stimulating
influences
of
the
sun
light
and
heat
is
the
principal
cause
of
the
suspension
of
the
circulation
in
the
night
the
flow
ceases
altogether
soon
after
the
buds
begin
to
swell
before
we
might
obtain
a
contribution
to
an
approximate
estimate
of
the
quantity
of
moisture
abstracted
by
forest
vegetation
from
the
earth
and
the
air
by
ascertaining
as
nearly
as
possible
the
quantity
of
wood
on
a
given
area
the
proportion
of
assimilable
matter
contained
in
the
fluids
of
the
tree
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
the
ages
of
the
trees
respectively
and
the
quantity
of
leaf
and
seed
annually
shed
by
them
the
results
would
indeed
be
very
vague
but
they
might
serve
to
check
or
confirm
estimates
arrived
at
by
other
processes
the
following
facts
are
items
too
loose
perhaps
to
be
employed
as
elements
in
such
a
computation
williams
who
wrote
when
the
woods
of
northern
new
england
were
generally
in
their
primitive
condition
states
the
number
of
trees
growing
on
an
acre
at
from
one
hundred
and
fifty
to
six
hundred
and
fifty
according
to
their
size
and
the
quality
of
the
soil
the
quantity
of
wood
at
from
fifty
to
two
hundred
cords
or
from
to
cubic
yards
but
adds
that
on
land
covered
with
pines
the
quantity
of
wood
would
be
much
greater
whether
he
means
to
give
the
entire
solid
contents
of
the
tree
or
as
is
usual
in
ordinary
estimates
in
new
england
the
marketable
wood
only
the
trunks
and
larger
branches
does
not
appear
next
to
the
pine
the
maple
would
probably
yield
a
larger
amount
to
a
given
area
than
any
of
the
other
trees
mentioned
by
williams
but
mixed
wood
in
general
measures
most
in
a
good
deal
of
observation
on
this
subject
the
largest
quantity
of
marketable
wood
i
have
ever
known
cut
on
an
acre
of
virgin
forest
was
one
hundred
and
four
cords
or
cubic
yards
and
half
that
amount
is
considered
a
very
fair
yield
the
smaller
trees
branches
and
twigs
would
not
increase
the
quantity
more
than
per
and
if
we
add
as
much
more
for
the
roots
we
should
have
a
total
of
about
cubic
yards
i
think
williams
estimate
too
large
though
it
would
fall
much
below
the
product
of
the
great
trees
of
the
mississippi
valley
of
oregon
and
of
california
it
should
be
observed
that
these
measurements
are
those
of
the
wood
as
it
lies
when
or
piled
up
for
market
and
exceed
the
real
solid
contents
by
not
less
than
fifteen
per
cent
in
a
soil
of
medium
quality
says
clavé
quoting
the
estimates
of
pfeil
for
the
climate
of
prussia
the
volume
of
a
hectare
of
pines
twenty
years
old
would
exceed
cubic
mètres
cubic
yards
to
the
acre
it
would
amount
to
but
in
a
meagre
soil
this
tree
attains
its
maximum
of
mean
growth
at
the
age
of
years
at
that
age
in
the
sandy
earth
of
prussia
it
produces
annually
about
cubic
mètres
with
a
total
volume
of
cubic
mètres
per
hectare
cubic
yards
per
acre
after
this
age
the
volume
increases
but
the
mean
rate
of
growth
diminishes
at
eighty
years
for
instance
the
volume
is
cubic
mètres
the
annual
production
only
the
beech
reaches
its
maximum
of
annual
growth
at
one
hundred
and
twenty
years
it
then
has
a
total
volume
of
cubic
mètres
to
the
hectare
cubic
yards
to
the
acre
and
produces
cubic
mètres
per
year
clavé
these
measures
i
believe
include
the
entire
ligneous
product
of
the
tree
exclusive
of
the
roots
and
express
the
actual
solid
contents
the
specific
gravity
of
maple
wood

stated
to
be
maple
sap

sugar
at
the
rate
of
about
one
pound
sugar
to
three
gallons

and
wet

to
dry

in
about
the
proportion
of
nineteen
to
sixteen
besides
the
sugar
there
is
a
small
residuum
of
sand
composed
of
phosphate
of
lime
with
a
little
silex
and
it
is
certain
that
by
the
ordinary
hasty
process
of
manufacture
a
good
deal
of
sugar
is
lost
for
the
drops
condensed
from
the
vapor
of
the
boilers
on
the
rafters
of
the
rude

the

a
decidedly
sweet

the
elaborated
sap
passing
out
of
the

is
received
into
the
inner

a
part
of
what
descends
finds
its
way
even
to
the

is
all
along
diffused
laterally
into
the

it
meets

with

so
there
is
no
separate

of

kinds

no

exists
separately
in
any

somerville
who
states
that
the
dry

occupies
an

that
the

about

the

conclusion
arrived
at
by
noah
webster
in
his
very
learned
and
able
paper
on
the
supposed
change
in
the
temperature
of
winter
read
before
the
connecticut
academy
of
arts
and
sciences
in
was
as
follows
from
a
careful
comparison
of
these
facts
it
appears
that
the
weather
in
modern
winters
in
the
united
states
is
more
inconstant
than
when
the
earth
was
covered
with
woods
at
the
first
settlement
of
europeans
in
the
country
that
the
warm
weather
of
autumn
extends
further
into
the
winter
months
and
the
cold
weather
of
winter
and
spring
encroaches
upon
the
summer
that
the
wind
being
more
variable
snow
is
less
permanent
and
perhaps
the
same
remark
may
be
applicable
to
the
ice
of
the
rivers
these
effects
seem
to
result
necessarily
from
the
greater
quantity
of
heat
accumulated
in
the
earth
in
summer
since
the
ground
has
been
cleared
of
wood
and
exposed
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
to
the
greater
depth
of
frost
in
the
earth
in
winter

the
exposure
of
its
uncovered
surface

an

at

that
it
did

coal
was
largely
exported
to
the
continent
it
had
not
yet
come
into
general
use
in
england
it
is
a
question
of
much
interest
when
coal
was
first
employed
in
england
for
fuel
i
can
find
no
evidence
that
it
was
used
as
a
combustible
until
more
than
a
century
after
the
norman
conquest
it
has
been
said
that
it
was
known
to
the
population
but
i
am
acquainted
with
no
passage
in
the
literature
of
that
people
which
proves
this
the
dictionaries
explain
the
word
by
sea
coal
i
have
met
with
this
word
in
no
work
except
in
the
from
a
manuscript
certainly
not
older
than
the
twelfth
century
and
in
that
passage
it
may
as
probably
mean
peat
as
coal
and
quite
as
probably
something
else
as
either
coal
is
not
mentioned
in
king
alfred
bede
in
glanville
or
in
robert
of
gloucester
though
all
these
writers
speak
of
jet
as
found
in
england
and
are
full
in
their
enumeration
of
the
mineral
products
of
the
island
england
was
anciently
remarkable
for
its
forests
but
cæsar
says
it
wanted
the
and
the
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
means
the
beech
which
as
the
remains
in
the
danish
peat
mosses
show
is
a
tree
of
late
introduction
into
denmark
where
it
succeeded
the
fir
a
tree
not
now
native
to
that
country
the
succession
of
forest
crops
seems
to
have
been
the
same
in
england
for
harrison
speaks
of
the
great
store
of
firre
found
lying
at
their
whole
lengths
in
the
fens
and
marises
of
lancashire
and
other
counties
where
not
even
bushes
grew
in
his
time
we
can
not
be
sure
what
species
of
evergreen
cæsar
intended
by
the
popular
designations
of
trees
are
always
more
vague
and
uncertain
in
their
application
than
those
of
trees
has
been
very
loosely
employed
even
in
botanical
nomenclature
and
and
are
often
confounded
in
rossmässler
pp
if
it
were
certain
that
the
of
cæsar
was
the
fir
formerly
and
still
found
in
peat
mosses
and
that
he
was
right
in
denying
the
existence
of
the
beech
in
england
in
his
time
the
observation
would
be
very
important
because
it
would
fix
a
date
at
which
the
fir
had
become
extinct
and
the
beech
had
not
yet
appeared
in
the
island
the
english
oak
though
strong
and
durable
was
not
considered
generally
suitable
for
finer
work
in
the
sixteenth
century
there
were
however
exceptions
of

this
passage
is
also
of
interest
as
showing
that
soaking
in
salt
water
as
a
mode
of
seasoning
was
practised
in
harrison
time
but
the
importation
of
wainscot
or
boards
for

panelling
and
otherwise
finishing

which
was
generally
of

commenced
three
centuries
before
the
time
of

on

of

which
could
have
been
far
more
valuable
if
the

given

this

doubtless

the
year
in
which
these
provisions
were
made
does
not
appear
but
they
belong
to
the
reign
of
henry
iii
in
a
letter
addressed
to
the
minister
of
public
works
after
the
terrible
inundations
of
the
emperor
thus
happily
expressed
himself
before
we
seek
the
remedy
for
an
evil
we
inquire
into
its
cause
whence
come
the
sudden
floods
of
our
rivers
from
the
water
which
falls
on
the
mountains
not
from
that
which
falls
on
the
plains
the
waters
which
fall
on
our
fields
produce
but
few
rivulets
but
those
which
fall
on
our
roofs
and
are
collected
in
the
gutters
form
small
streams
at
once
now
the
roofs
are
mountains
the
gutters
are
valleys
to
continue
the
comparison
observes
roofs
are
smooth
and
impermeable
and
the
rain
water
pours
rapidly
off
from
their
surfaces
but
this
rapidity
of
flow
would
be
greatly
diminished
if
the
roofs
were
carpeted
with
mosses
and
grasses
more
still
if
they
were
covered
with
dry
leaves
little
shrubs
strewn
branches
and
other
impediments
in
short
if
they
were
wooded
forestières
the
roots
of
vegetables
says
perform
the
office
of
a
perpendicular
drainage
analogous
to
that
which
has
been
practised
with
success
in
holland
and
in
some
parts
of
the
british
islands
this
system
consists
in
driving
down
three
or
four
thousand
stakes
upon
a
hectare
the
rain
water
filters
down
along
the
stakes
and
in
certain
cases
as
favorable
results
are
obtained
by
this
method
as
by
horizontal
drains
the
productiveness
of
egypt
has
been
attributed
too
exclusively
to
the
fertilizing
effects
of
the
slime
deposited
by
the
inundations
of
the
nile
for
in
that
climate
a
liberal
supply
of
water
would
produce
good
crops
on
almost
any
ordinary
sand
while
without
water
the
richest
soil
would
yield
nothing
the
sediment
deposited
annually
is
but
a
very
small
fraction
of
an
inch
in
thickness
it
is
alleged
that
in
quantity
it
would
be
hardly
sufficient
for
a
good
top
dressing
and
that
in
quality
it
is
not
chemically
distinguishable
from
the
soil
inches
or
feet
below
the
surface
but
to
deny
as
some
writers
have
done
that
the
slime
has
any
fertilizing
properties
at
all
is
as
great
an
error
as
the
opposite
one
of
ascribing
all
the
agricultural
wealth
of
egypt
to
that
single
cause
of
productiveness
fine
soils
deposited
by
water
are
almost
uniformly
rich
in
all
climates
those
brought
down
by
rivers
carried
out
into
salt
water
and
then
returned
again
by
the
tide
seem
to
be
more
permanently
fertile
than
any
others
the
polders
of
the
netherland
coast
are
of
this
character
and
the
meadows
in
lincolnshire
which
have
been
covered
with
slime
by
as
it
is
called
or
admitting
water
over
them
at
high
tide
are
remarkably
productive
see
no
the
laws
against
clearing
have
never
been
able
to
prevent
these
operations
when
the
proprietor
found
his
advantage
in
them
and
the
long
series
of
royal
ordinances
and
decrees
of
parliaments
proclaimed
from
the
days
of
charlemagne
to
our
own
with
a
view
of
securing
forest
property
have
served
only
to
show
the
impotence
of
legislative
notion
on
this
subject
clavé
sur
a
proprietor
can
always
contrive
to
clear
his
woods
whatever
may
be
done
to
prevent
him
it
is
a
mere
question
of
time
and
a
few
imprudent
cuttings
a
few
abuses
of
the
right
of
pasturage
suffice
to
destroy
a
forest
in
spite
of
all
regulations

as
quoted
by

both

that
the
preservation

in

is
practicable
only
by
their
transfer
to
the
state
which
alone
can
protect
them
and
secure

it
is
much
to
be
feared
that
even
this
measure
would
be
inadequate
to
save
the
forests
of
the
american

there
is
little
respect
for

in

the
federal

certainly
would
not

the

agent
of

be
preserved

it
more

is
most
rapid
this
is
usually
in
the
direction
of
the
axis
of
the
ravine
as
the
current
pours
out
of
the
gorge
and
escapes
from
the
lateral
confinement
of
its
walls
it
spreads
and
divides
itself
into
numerous
smaller
streams
which
shoot
out
from
the
mouth
of
the
valley
as
from
a
centre
in
different
directions

of

the

below

rapidly
raised
by

the

nearly
the
original
direction
moves
with
the
greatest
momentum
and
consequently
transports
the
solid
matter
with
which
it
is
charged
to
the
greatest
distance
the
untravelled
reader
will
comprehend
this
the
better
when
he
is
informed
that
the
southern
slope
of
the
alps
generally
rises
suddenly
out
of
the
plain
with
no
intervening
hill
to
break
the
abruptness
of
the
transition
except
those
consisting
of
comparatively
small
heaps
of
its
own
debris
brought
down
by
ancient
glaciers
or
recent
torrents
the
torrents
do
not
wind
down
valleys
gradually
widening
to
the
rivers
or
the
sea
but
leap
at
once
from
the
flanks
of
the
mountains
upon
the
plains
below
this
arrangement
of
surfaces
naturally
facilitates
the
formation
of
vast
deposits
at
their
points
of
emergence
and
the
centre
of
the
accumulation
in
the
case
of
very
small
torrents
is
not
unfrequently
a
hundred
feet
high
and
sometimes
very
much
more
torrents
and
the
rivers
that
receive
them
transport
mountain
debris
to
almost
incredible
distances
lorentz
in
an
official
report
on
this
subject
as
quoted
by
marschand
from
the
memoirs
of
the
agricultural
society
of
lyons
says
the
felling
of
the
woods
produces
torrents
which
cover
the
cultivated
soil
with
pebbles
and
fragments
of
rock
and
they
do
not
confine
their
ravages
to
the
vicinity
of
the
mountains
but
extend
them
into
the
fertile
fields
of
provence
and
other
departments
to
the
distance
of
forty
or
fifty
leagues
der
the
precipitous
walls
of
the
val
de
lys
and
more
especially
of
the
val
doveria
though
here
and
there
shattered
show
in
many
places
a
smoothness
of
face
over
a
large
vertical
plane
at
the
height
of
hundreds
of
feet
above
the
bottom
of
the
valley
which
no
known
agency
but
glacier
ice
is
capable
of
producing
and
of
course
they
can
have
undergone
no
sensible
change
at
those
points
for
a
vast
length
of
time
the
beds
of
the
rivers
which
flow
through
those
valleys
suffer
lateral
displacement
occasionally
where
there
is
room
for
the
shifting
of
the
channel
but
if
any
elevation
or
depression
takes
place
in
them
it
is
too
slow
to
be
perceptible
except
in
case
of
some
merely
temporary
obstruction
lombardini
found
twenty
years
ago
that
the
mineral
matter
brought
down
to
the
po
by
its
tributaries
was
in
general
comminuted
to
about
the
same
degree
of
fineness
as
the
sands
of
its
bed
at
their
points
of
discharge
in
the
case
of
the
trebbia
which
rises
high
in
the
apennines
and
empties
into
the

piacenza
it
was

and
coarse
gravel

of

some
of
those
which
discharge
their
waters
into

great

then
either
retained
their
woods
or
had
been
so
long
clear
of
them
that
the
torrents
had
removed
most
of
the
disintegrated
and
loose
rock
in
their
upper
basins
the
valley
of
the
trebbia
had
been
recently
cleared
and
all
the
forces
which
tend
to
the

whether
any

has
been
produced
in

three

much
larger
proportion
of

the
moderate
annual
floods
of
the

were
occasioned
by
the
melting
of
the

as
appears
by
a
passage
of

they
took

the

castellani
on
the
page
just
quoted
says
that
even
so
late
as
about
the

required
a
heavy
rain

a
week
to
overflow
its

but
that
forty
years
later
it
was
sometimes
raised
to

this
change

can
not
be
ascribed
to

for
a

of
the

of

the

any

the

will
admit

such

a

must
cover

possess

he
compensates
this

of
the
wood
in
preventing
avalanches
is
well
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
where
the
forest
is
wanting
the
inhabitants
of
localities
exposed
to
snow
slides
often
supply
the
place
of
the
trees
by
driving
stakes
through
the
snow
into
the
ground
and
thus
checking
its
propensity
to
slip
the
woods
themselves
are
sometimes
thus
protected
against
avalanches
originating
on
slopes
above
them
and
as
a
further
security
small
trees
are
cut
down
along
the
upper
line
of
the
forest
and
laid
against
the
trunks
of
larger
trees
transversely
to
the
path
of
the
slide
to
serve
as
a
fence
or
dam
to
the
motion
of
an
incipient
avalanche
which
may
by
this
means
be
arrested
before
it
acquires
a
destructive
velocity
and
force
the
tide
rises
at
quebec
to
the
height
of
feet
and
when
it
is
aided
by
a
northeast
wind
it
flows

almost
irresistible
violence
rafts
containing
several
hundred
thousand
cubic
feet
of

they
were
little
else
than

to
be
taken
to

and
sold
as
lumber
on
arriving
at
their

of

the
lumber
trade
at
quebec
is
still
very
large
according
to
a
recent
article
in
the
des
deux
that
city
exported
in
cubic
feet
of
squared
timber
and
square
feet
of
planches
the
thickness
of
the
boards
is
not
stated
but
i
believe
they
are
generally
cut
an
inch
and
a
quarter
thick
for
the
quebec
trade
and
as
they
shrink
somewhat
in
drying
we
may
estimate
ten
square
for
one
cubic
foot
of
boards
this
gives
a
total
of
cubic
feet
the
specific
gravity
of
white
pine
is
and
the
weight
of
this
quantity
of
lumber
very
little
of
which
is
thoroughly
seasoned
would
exceed
a
million
of
tons
even
supposing
it
to
consist
wholly
of
wood
as
light
as
pine
new
brunswick

exports
a
large

this
name
from
the
french
which
has
a
wider
meaning
is
applied
in
america
to
temporary
huts
or
habitations
erected
for
the
convenience
of
forest
life
or
in
connection
with
works
of
material
improvement
trees
differ
much
in
their
power
of
resisting
the
action
of
forest
fires
different
woods
vary
greatly
in
combustibility
and
even
when
their
bark
is
scarcely
scorched
they
are
partly
in
consequence
of
physiological
character
and
partly
from
the
greater
or
less
depth
at
which
their
roots
habitually
lie
below
the
surface
very
differently
affected
by
running
fires
the
white
pine
as
it
is
the
most
valuable
is
also
perhaps
the
most
delicate
tree
of
the
american
forest
while
its
congener
the
northern
pitch
pine
is
less
injured
by
fire
than
any
other
tree
of
that
country
i
have
heard
experienced
lumbermen
maintain
that
the
growth
of
this
pine
was
even
accelerated
by
a
fire
brisk
enough
to
destroy
all
other
trees
and
i
have
myself
seen
it
still
flourishing
after
a
conflagration
which
had
left
not
a
green
leaf
but
its
own
in
the
wood
and
actually
throwing
out
fresh
foliage
when
the
old
had
been
quite
burnt
off
and
the
bark
almost
converted
into
charcoal
the
wood
of
the
pitch
pine
is
of
comparatively
little
value
for
the
joiner
but
it
is
useful
for
very
many
purposes
its
rapidity
of
growth
in
even
poor
soils
its
hardihood
and
its
abundant
yield
of
resinous
products
entitle
it
to
much
more
consideration
as
a
plantation
tree
than
it
has
hitherto
received
in
europe
or
america
between
fifty
and
sixty
years
ago
a
steep
mountain
with
which
i
am
very
familiar
composed
of
metamorphic
rock
and
at
that
time
covered
with
a
thick
coating
of
soil
and
a
dense
primeval
forest
was
accidentally
burnt
over
the
fire
took
place
in
a
very
dry
season
the
slope
of
the
mountain
was
too
rapid
to
retain
much
water
and
the
conflagration
was
of
an
extraordinarily
fierce
character
consuming
the
wood
almost
entirely
burning
the
leaves
and
combustible
portion
of
the
mould
and
in
many
places
cracking
and
disintegrating
the
rock
beneath
the
rains
of
the
following
autumn
carried
off
much
of
the
remaining
soil
and
the
mountain
side
was
nearly
bare
of
wood
for
two
or
three
years
afterward
at
length
a
new
crop
of
trees
sprang
up
and
grew
vigorously
and
the
mountain
is
now
thickly
covered
again
but
the
depth
of
mould
and
earth
is
too
small
to
allow
the
trees
to
reach
maturity
when
they
attain
to
the
diameter
of
about
six
inches
they
uniformly
die
and
this
they
will
no
doubt
continue
to
do
until
the
decay
of
leaves
and
wood
on
the
surface
and
the
decomposition
of
the
subjacent
rock
shall
have
formed
perhaps
hundreds
of
years
hence
a
stratum
of
soil
thick
enough
to
support
a
forest
the
growth
of
the
white
pine
on
a
good
soil
and
in
open
ground
is
rather
rapid
until
it
reaches
the
diameter
of
a
couple
of
feet
after
which
it
is
much
slower
the
favorite
habitat
of
this
tree
is
light
sandy
earth
on
this
soil
and
in
a
dense
wood
it
requires
a
century
to
attain
the
diameter
of
a
yard

measured
this

at
four

entirely
above

a

cuts
more

them
that
their

established
the

on

stood
a

scattered
pines

in
abundance
with
other

i
planted
the

all

completely
disappeared

there
were

it
should
be
added
however
that
the

bore

they

disappeared
as
the

were
extirpated
and
the

now
does
not

it

that
the

which

in

is
possessed
by

instances
where

grown
after
lying
dormant

the
following
cases
mentioned
by

pp
may
be
new
to
many
readers
the
lands
in
panton
vermont
which
have
here
been
once
cultivated
and
again
permitted
to
lie
waste
for
several
years
yield
a
rich
and
fine
growth
of
hickory
of
this
wood
there
is
not
i
believe
a
single
tree
in
any
original
forest
within
fifty
miles
from
this
spot
the
native
growth
was
here
white
pine
of
which
i
did
not
see
a
single
stem
in
a
whole
grove
of
hickory
the
hickory
is
a
walnut
bearing
a
fruit
too
heavy
to
be
likely
to
be
carried
fifty
miles
by
birds
and
besides
i
believe
it
is
not
eaten
by
any
bird
indigenous
to
vermont
a
field
about
five
miles
from
northampton
on
an
eminence
called
rail
hill
was
cultivated
about
a
century
ago
the
native
growth
here
and
in
all
the
surrounding
region
was
wholly
oak
chestnut
as
the
field
belonged
to
my
grandfather
i
had
the
best
opportunity
of
learning
its
history
it
contained
about
five
acres
in
the
form
of
an
irregular
parallelogram
as
the
savages
rendered
the
cultivation
dangerous
it
was
given
up
on
this
ground
there
sprang
up
a
grove
of
white
pines
covering
the
field
and
retaining
its
figure
exactly
so
far
as
i
remember
there
was
not
in
it
a
single
oak
or
chestnut
tree
there
was
not
a
single
pine
whose
seeds
were
or
probably
had
for
ages
been
sufficiently
near
to
have
been
planted
on
this
spot
the
fact
that
these
white
pines
covered
this
field
exactly
so
as
to
preserve
both
its
extent
and
its
figure
and
that
there
were
none
in
the
neighborhood
are
decisive
proofs
that
cultivation
brought
up
the
seeds
of
a
former
forest
within
the
limits
of
vegetation
and
gave
them
an
opportunity
to
germinate

wearisome

paragraph
from

i

i
did
never
have
sight
of
so
much
as
a

in
the

of
kiew
has
for
some
years
not
suffered
at
all
from
the
locusts
which
formerly
came
every
year
in
vast
swarms
and
the
curculio
so
injurious
to
the
turnip
crops
is
less
destructive
there
than
in
other
parts
of
the
province
this
improvement
is
owing
partly
to
the
more
thorough
cultivation
of
the
soil
partly
to
the
groves
which
are
interspersed
among
the
plough
lands
when

i
believe
the
only
country
where
private

have
been
set
in

the

which
tend
to
keep
large

long
undivided
and
in

line
of
inheritance
the
wealth
of
the

and
the
difficulty
of
finding
safe
and
profitable
investments
of

combine
to
afford
encouragements
for
the
plantation
of
forests
which
nowhere
else
exist
in
the
same
degree
the
climate
of
england
too
is
very
favorable
to
the
growth
of

the
character
of

secures
a
large
part
of
the
island
from
the
evils
which
have
resulted
from
the

elsewhere
and
therefore
their
restoration
is
a
matter
of
less
geographical
importance

on

continent
the
preservation
of
the
woods
on
the
eastern
frontier
of
france
as
a
kind
of
natural
abattis
is
also
recognized
by
the
government
of
that
country
as
an
important
measure
of
military
defence

there
have
been
conflicting
opinions
on
the
subject

rapidly
extending

allowing
the

proportion
as
in

the
american
railroads
required
ties
in
the
consumption
of
timber
in
europe
and
america
during
the
present
generation
occasioned
by
this
demand
has
required
the
sacrifice
of
many
hundred
thousand
acres
of
forest
and
if
we
add
the
quantity
employed
for
telegraph
posts
we
have
an
amount
of
destruction
for
entirely
new
purposes
which
is
really
appalling
the
consumption
of
wood
for
lucifer
matches
is
enormous
and
i
have
heard
of
several
instances
where
tracts
of
pine
forest
hundreds
and
even
thousands
of
acres
in
extent
have
been
purchased
and
felled
solely
to
supply
timber
for
this
purpose
the
demand
for
wood
for
small
carvings
and
for
children
toys
is
incredibly
large
rentzsch
states
the
export
of
such
objects
from
the
town
of
sonneberg
alone
to
have
amounted
in
to
centner
or
three
thousand
tons
see
no
the
importance
of
so
managing
the
forest
that
it
may
continue
indefinitely
to
furnish
an
adequate
supply
of
material
for
naval
architecture
is
well
illustrated
by
some
remarks
of
the
same
author
in
the
valuable
little
work
just
cited
he
suggests
that
the
prosperity
of
modern
england
is
due
in
no
small
degree
to
the
supplies
of
wood
and
other
material
for
building
and
equipping
ships
received
from
the
forests
of
her
colonies
and
of
other
countries
with
which
she
has
maintained
close
commercial
relations
and
he
adds
spain
which
by
her
position
seemed
destined
for
universal
power
and
once
in
fact
possessed
it
has
lost
her
political
rank
because
during
the
unwise
administration
of
the
successors
of
philip
ii
the
empty
exchequer
could
not
furnish
the
means
of
building
new
fleets
for
the
destruction
of
the
forests
had
raised
the
price
of
timber
above
the
resources
of
the
state
the
market
price
of
timber
like
that
of
all
other
commodities
may
be
said
in
a
general
way
to
be
regulated
by
the
laws
of
demand
and
supply
but
it
is
also
controlled
by
those
seemingly
unrelated
accidents
which
so
often
disappoint
the
calculations
of
political
economists
in
other
branches
of
commerce
a
curious
case
of
this
sort
is
noticed
by
cerini
impianto
e
conservazione
dei
in
the
mountains
on
the
lago
maggiore
in
years
when
maize
is
cheap
the
woodcutters
can
provide
themselves
with
corn
meal
enough
for
a
week
by
three
days
labor
and
they
refuse
to
work
the
remaining
four
hence
the
dealers
in
wood
not
being
able
to
supply
the
demand
for
want
of
laborers
are
obliged
to
raise
the
price
for
the
following
season
both
for
timber
and
for
firewood
so
that
a
low
price
of
grain
occasions
a
high
price
of
building
lumber
and
of
fuel
the
consequence
is
that
though
the
poor
have
supplied
themselves
cheaply
with
food
they
must
pay
dear
for
firewood
and
they
can
not
get
work
because
the
high
price
of
lumber
has
discouraged
repairs
and
building
the
expense
of
which
landed
proprietors
can
not
undertake
when
their
incomes
have
been
reduced
by
sales
of
grain
at
low
rates
and
hence
there
is
not
demand
enough
for
lumber
to
induce
the
timber
merchants
to
furnish
employment
to
the
woodmen
besides
the
substitution
of
iron
for
wood
a
great
saving
of
consumption
of
this
latter
material
has
been
effected
by
the
revival
of
ancient
methods
of
increasing
its
durability
and
the
invention
of
new
processes
for
the
same
purpose
the
most
effectual
preservative
yet
discovered
for
wood
employed
on
land
is
sulphate
of
copper
a
solution
of
which
is
introduced
into
the
pores
of
the
wood
while
green
by
soaking
by
or
most
economically
by
the
simple
pressure
of
a
column
of
the
fluid
in
a
small
pipe
connected
with
the
end
of
the
piece
of
timber
subjected
to
the
treatment
clavé
pp
gives
an
interesting
account
of
the
various
processes
employed
for
rendering
wood
imperishable
and
states
that
railroad
ties
injected
with
sulphate
of
copper
in
were
found
absolutely
unaltered
in
and
telegraphic
posts
prepared
two
years
earlier
are
now
in
a
state
of
perfect
preservation
for
many
purposes
the
method
of
injection
is
too
expensive
and
some
simpler
process
is
much
to
be
desired
the
question
of
the
proper
time
of
felling
timber
is
not
settled
and
the
best
modes
of
air
water
and
steam
seasoning
are
not
yet
fully
ascertained
experiments
on
these
subjects
would
be
well
worth
the
patronage
of
governments
in
new
countries
where
they
can
be
very
easily
made
without
the
necessity
of
much
waste
of
valuable
material
and
without
expensive
arrangements
for
observation
the
practice
of
stripping
living
trees
of
their
bark
some
years
before
they
are
felled
is
as
old
as
the
time
of
vitruvius
but
is
much
less
followed
than
it
deserves
partly
because
the
timber
of
trees
so
treated
inclines
to
crack
and
split
and
partly
because
it
becomes
so
hard
as
to
be
wrought
with
considerable
difficulty
in
america
economy
in
the
consumption
of
fuel
has
been
much
promoted
by
the
substitution
of
coal
for
wood
the
general
use
of
stoves
both
for
wood
and
coal
and
recently
by
the
employment
of
anthracite
in
the
furnaces
of
stationary
and
locomotive
all
the
objections
to
the
use
of
anthracite
for
this
latter
purpose
appear
to
have
been

estimates
the

for
the

supposes

the

in

would
considerably
exceed
that
for
the
german

because
france
has
relatively
more
surface
unfit
for
any
growth
but
that
of
wood
because
the
form
and
geological
character
of
her
mountains
expose
her
territory
to
much
greater
injury
from
torrents
and
because
at

by

sur

adds
the

are
very
unequally
distributed
through
the

of
this
vast

in
the
north
they
form
immense
masses

cover
whole

while

while

this
state
of
things
is
partly
due
to
the
want
of
facilities
of
transportation
and
some
parts
of
the
united

are
in
a
similar
condition
during
a
severe
winter
six
or
seven
years
ago
the
sudden
freezing
of
the
canals

before
a
large
american
town
had
received
its
usual

occasioned
an
enormous

but
the

refused

not

this
subsidence
diminished
the

consequently
the
evaporation
of

its

ought
to
raise
it
to

it
is
indeed
not
proved
that
the

diminishes
the

upon

it
is
certain
that

that

a
less

therefore
the

swarms

in

by

the
finder
of
a

tree
on
the

of

owner
was
regarded
as
entitled
to
the

by

as

right
he
might
cut
the

at
the
proper
season
without
asking

of
the
proprietor
of
the

the
quantity
of
wild
honey
in
a
tree
was
often
large
and
bee
hunting
was
so
profitable
that
it
became
almost
a
regular
profession
the
bee
hunter
sallied
forth
with
a
small
box
containing
honey
and
a
little
vermilion
the
bees
which
were
attracted
by
the
honey
marked
themselves
with
the
vermilion
and
hence
were
more
readily
followed
in
their
homeward
flight
and
recognized
when
they
returned
a
second
time
for
booty
when
loaded
with

this
insect
returns
to
his
hive
by
the
shortest
route
and
hence
a
straight
line
is
popularly
called

line
by
such
a
line
the
hunter
followed
the
bees
to
their
sylvan
hive
marked
the
tree
with
his
initials
and
returned
to
secure
his
prize
in
the
autumn
when
the
right
of
the
bee
hunter
was
at
last
disputed
by
the
land
proprietors
it
was
with
difficulty
that
judgments
could
be
obtained
in
inferior
courts
in
favor
of
the
latter
and
it
was
only
after
repeated
decisions
of
the

legal
tribunals
that
the

right
of
the
owner
of

acquiesced

some

the

it

it
has

of

of

that
a
large
wood
has
been
discovered

of

has
the
property
of
sending
up
both
vertical

from
the

of
felled
trees
and
forming
a
new

it
was
at

supposed
that
this
forest
grew
only
on
the
mountains
of
which
the
hero
of

rarely

shown
that

of

only
to

it
this
has
been
observed
in
most
of
the

plantations
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
they
have
not
been
able
to
attain
to
full
growth
when
the
vegetation
was
perceived
to
languish
they
were
cut
in
the
hope
that
this
operation
would
restore
their
vigor
and
that
the
new
shoots
would
succeed
better
than
the
original
trees
and
in
fact
they
seemed
to
be
recovering
for
the
first
few
years
but
the
shoots
were
soon
attacked
by
the
same
decay
and
the
operation
had
to
be
renewed
at
shorter
and
shorter
intervals
until
at
last
it
was
found
necessary
to
treat
as
coppices

originally
designed
for
the

was
this
all
the
soil
periodically
bared
by
these
cuttings

impoverished

less

less
suited

of

was
then
proposed
to
introduce
the
pine
and
plant
with
it
the
vacancies
and

by
this
means
the
forest
was
saved
from
the
ruin
which
threatened
it
and
now
more
than
acres
of
pines
from
fifteen
to

not

the

the

of

often
die
from
this
cause
as
any
one
may
observe
by
following
the
paths
made
by

i
have
remarked
elsewhere
that
most
insects
which
deposit
and
hatch
their
eggs
in
the
wood
of
the
natural
forest
confine
themselves
to
dead
trees
not
only
is
this
the
fact
but
it
is
also
true
that
many
of
the
borers
attack
only
freshly
cut
timber
their
season
of
labor
is
a
short
one
and
unless
the
tree
is
cut
during
this
period
it
is
safe
from
them
in
summer
you
may
hear
them
plying
their
augers
in
the
wood
of
a
young
pine
with
soft
green
bark
as
you
sit
upon
its
trunk
within
a
week
after
it
has
been
felled
but
the
windfalls
of
the
winter
lie
uninjured
by
the
worm
and
even
undecayed
for
centuries
in
the
pine
woods
of
new
england
after
the
regular
lumberman
has
removed
the
standing
trees
these
old
trunks
are
hauled
out
from
the
mosses
and
leaves
which
half
cover
them
and
often
furnish
excellent
timber
the
slow
decay
of
such
timber
in
the
woods
it
may
be
remarked
furnishes
another
proof
of
the
uniformity
of
temperature
and
humidity
in
the
forest
for
the
trunk
of
a
tree
lying
on
grass
or
plough
land
and
of

exposed
to
all
the
alternations
of

decomposition
for

the

of

exhibit
similar
facts

of

further
observes
on
the
page
last
quoted
the
removal
of
leaves
is
injurious
to
the
forest
not
only
because
it
retards
the
growth
of
trees
but
still
more
because
it
disqualifies
the
soil
for
the
production
of
particular
species
when
the
beech
languishes
and
the
development
of
its
branches
is
less
vigorous
and
its
crown
less
spreading
it
becomes
unable
to
resist
the
encroachments
of
the
fir
this
latter
tree
thrives
in
an
inferior
soil
and
being
no
longer
stifled
by
the
thick
foliage
of
the
beech
it
spreads
gradually
through
the
wood
while
the
beech
retreats
before
it
and
finally
perishes
the
study
of
the
natural
order
of
succession
in
forest
trees
is
of
the
utmost
importance
in
sylviculture
because
it
guides
us
in
the
selection
of
the
species
to
be
employed
in
planting
a
new
or
restoring
a
decayed
forest
when
ground
is
laid
bare
both
of
trees
and
of
vegetable
mould
and
left
to
the
action
of
unaided
and
unobstructed
nature
she
first
propagates
trees
which
germinate
and
grow
only
under
the
influence
of
a
full
supply
of
light
and
air
and
then
in
succession
other
species
according
to
their
ability
to
bear
the
shade
and
their
demand
for
more
abundant
nutriment
in
northern
europe
the
larch
the
white
birch
the
aspen
first
appear
then
follow
the
maple
the
alder
the
ash
the
fir
then
the
oak
and
the
linden
and
then
the
beech
the
trees
called
by
these
respective
names
in
the
united
states
are
not
specifically
the
same
as
their
european
namesakes
nor
are
they
always
even
the
equivalents
of
these
latter
and
therefore
the
order
of
succession
in
america
would
not
be
precisely
as
indicated
by
the
foregoing
list
but
it
nevertheless
very
nearly
corresponds
to
it
it
is
thought
important
to
encourage
the
growth
of
the
beech
in
denmark
and
northern
germany
because
it
upon
the
whole
yields
better
returns
than
other
trees
and
particularly
because
it
appears
not
to
exhaust
but
on
the
contrary
to
enrich
the
soil
for
by
shedding
its
leaves
it
returns
to
it
most
of
the
nutriment
it
has
drawn
from
it
and
at
the
same
time
furnishes
a
solvent
which
aids
materially
in
the
decomposition
of
its
mineral
constituents
when
the
forest
is
left
to
itself
the
order
of
succession
is
constant
and
its
occasional
inversion
is
always
explicable
by
some
human
interference
it
is
curious
that
the
trees
which
require
most
light
are
content
with
the
poorest
soils
and
the
trees
which
first
appear
are
also
those
which
propagate
themselves
farthest
to
the
north
the
birch
the
larch
and
the
fir
bear
a
severer
climate
than
the
oak
the
oak
than
the
beech
these
parallelisms
says
vaupell
are
very
interesting
because
they
are
entirely
independent
of
each
other
and
each
prescribes
the
same
order
of
when
vigorous
young
locusts
of
two
or
three
inches
in
diameter
are
polled
they
throw
out
a
great
number
of
very
shoots
which
arrange
themselves
in
a
globular
head
so
unlike
the
natural
crown
of
the
acacia
that
persons
familiar
only
with
the
untrained
tree
often
take
them
for
a
different
species
the
two
ideas
expressed
in
the
text
are
not
exactly
equivalent
because
though
the
consumption
of
animal
food
diminishes
the
amount
of
vegetable
aliment
required
for
human
use
yet
the
animals
themselves
consume
a
great
quantity
of
grain
and
roots
grown
on
ground
ploughed
and
cultivated
as
regularly
and
as
laboriously
as
any
other
the
bushels
of
oats
raised
in
the
united
states
in
and
fed
to
the
horses
the
potatoes
the
turnips
and
the
maize
employed
in
fattening
the
oxen
the
sheep
and
the
swine
slaughtered
the
same
year
occupied
an
extent
of
ground
which
cultivated
by
hand
labor
and
with
chinese
industry
and
skill
would
probably
have
produced
a
quantity
of
vegetable
food
equal
in
alimentary
power
to
the
flesh
of
the
quadrupeds
killed
for
domestic
use
hence
so
far
as
the
naked
question
of
of
aliment
is
concerned
the
meadows
and
the
pastures
might
as
well
have
remained
in
the
forest
condition
according
to
clavé
the
net
revenue
from
the
forests
of
the
state
in
france
making
no
allowance
for
interest
on
the
capital
represented
by
the
forest
is
two
dollars
per
acre
in
saxony
it
is
about
the
same
though
the
cost
of
administration
is
twice
as
much
as
in
france
in
würtemberg
it
is
about
a
dollar
an
acre
and
in
prussia
where
half
the
income
is
consumed
in
the
expenses
of
administration
it
sinks
to
less
than
half
a
dollar
this
low
rate
in
prussia
is
partly
explained
by
the
fact
that
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
annual
product
of
wood
is
either
conceded
to
persons
claiming
prescriptive
rights
or
sold
at
a
very
small
price
to
the
poor
taking
into
account
the
capital
invested
in
forest
land
and
adding
interest
upon
it
pressler
calculates
that
a
pine
wood
managed
with
a
view
to
felling
it
when
eighty
years
old
would
yield
only
one
eighth
of
one
per
cent
annual
profit
a
fir
wood
at
one
hundred
years
one
sixth
of
one
per
cent
a
beech
wood
at
one
hundred
and
twenty
years
one
fourth
of
one
per
cent
the
same
author
gives
the
net
income
of
the
new
forest
in
england
over
and
above
expenses
interest
not
computed
at
cents
per
acre
only
in
america
where
no
expense
is
bestowed
upon
the
woods
the
annual
growth
would
generally
be
estimated
much
higher
it
is
rare
that
a
american
dies
in
the
house
where
he
was
born
or
an
old
man
even
in
that
which
he
has
built
and
this
is
scarcely
less
true
of
the
rural
districts
where
every
man
owns
his
habitation
than
of
the
city
where
the
majority
live
in
hired
houses
this
life
of
incessant
flitting
is
unfavorable
for
the
execution
of
permanent
improvements
of
every
sort
and
especially
of
those
which
like
the
forest
are
slow
in
repaying
any
part
of
the
capital
expended
in
them
it
requires
a
very
generous
spirit
in
a
landholder
to
plant
a
wood
on
a
farm
he
expects
to
sell
or
which
he
knows
will
pass
out
of
the
hands
of
his
descendants
at
his
death
but
the
very
fact
of
having
begun
a
plantation
would
attach
the
proprietor
more
strongly
to
the
soil
for
which
he
had
made
such
a
sacrifice
and
the
paternal
acres
would
have
a
greater
value
in
the
eyes
of
a
succeeding
generation
if
thus
improved
and
beautified
by
the
labors
of
those
from
whom
they
were
inherited
landed
property
therefore
the
transfer
of
which
is
happily
free
from
every
legal
impediment
or
restriction
in
the
united
states
would
find
in
the
feelings
thus
prompted
a
moral
check
against
a
too
frequent
change
of
owners
and
would
tend
to
remain
long
enough
in
one
proprietor
or
one
family
to
admit
of
gradual
improvements
which
would
increase
its
value
both
to
the
possessor
and
to
the
state
it
has
been
often
asserted
by
eminent
writers
that
a
part
of
the
fens
in
lincolnshire
was
reclaimed
by

dikes

allegation

quantities

used

employed
for
military
purposes
it
is
a
fact
not
creditable
to
the
moral
sense
of

very
many
of

frequent
repetition
of
this
process
by

it
at
last
to
the

we
may
suppose
that

it
is
observed
in
the
northern

states
that
when
soils
containing
pebbles
are
cleared
and
cultivated
and
the
stones
removed
from
the

new
pebbles
and
even
bowlders
of
many

continue
to
show
themselves
above
the

for
a
long
series
of
years
in

the

are
thrown
up
in

similar
way
and
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
the
lower
rail
of
a
fence
thus
gradually
raised
a
foot
or
even
two
feet
above
the
ground
this
rising
of
stones
and
fences
is
popularly
ascribed
to
the
action
of
the
severe
frosts
of
that
climate
the
expansion
of
the

is
said
raises
its

with
the

objects
lying
near

connected
with
it

the
soil
thaws
in

it
settles
back
again
to
its
former
level
while
the
pebbles
and
posts
are
prevented
from
sinking
as
low
as
before
by
loose
earth
which
has
fallen
under
them
the
fact
that
the
elevation
spoken
of
is
observed
only
in
the
spring
gives
countenance
to
this
theory
which
is
perhaps
applicable
also
to
the
cases
stated
by

it
is
probable
that
the
two
causes

an
observation
of
jacini
to
the
effect
that
the
great
italian
lakes
discharge
themselves
partly
by
infiltration
beneath
the
hills
which
bound
them
the
amount
of
such
infiltration
must
depend
much
upon
the
hydrostatic
pressure
on
the
walls
of
the

basins
and
of
course
the
lowering
of
the
surface
of
these
lakes
by
diminishing
that
pressure
would
diminish
also
the
infiltration
it
is
now
proposed
to
lower
the
level
of
the
lake
of
como
some
feet
by
deepening
its
outlet
it
is
possible
that
the
effect
of
this
may

itself

themselves

of
the

which
the
last
four
centuries
have
bestowed
upon
man
the
necessity
of
irrigation
in
the
great
alluvial
plain
of
northern
italy
is
partly
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
superficial
stratum
of
fine
earth
and
vegetable
mould
is
very
extensively
underlaid
by
beds
of
pebbles
and
gravel
brought
down
by
mountain
torrents
at
a
remote
epoch
the
water
of
the
surface
soil
drains
rapidly
down
into
these
loose
beds
and
passes
off
by
subterranean
channels
to
some
unknown
point
of
discharge
but
this
circumstance
alone
is
not
a
sufficient
solution
is
it
not
possible
that
the
habits
of
vegetables
grown
in
countries
where
irrigation
has
been
immemorially
employed
have
been
so
changed
that
they
require
water
under
conditions
of
soil
and
climate
where
their
congeners
which
have
not
been
thus
indulgently
treated
do
not
there
are
some
atmospheric
phenomena
in
northern
italy
which
an
american
finds
it
hard
to
reconcile
with
what
he
has
observed
in
the
united
states
to
an
american
eye
for
instance
the
sky
of
piedmont
lombardy
and
the
northern
coast
of
the
mediterranean
is
always
whitish
and
curdled
and
it
never
has
the
intensity
and
fathomless
depth
of
the
blue
of
his
native
heavens
and
yet
the
heat
of
the
sun
rays
as
measured
by
sensation
and
at
the
same
time
the
evaporation
are
greater
than
they
would
be
with
the
thermometer
at
the
same
point
in
america
i
have
frequently
felt
in
italy
with
the
mercury
below
fahrenheit
and
with
a
mottled
and
almost
opaque
sky
a
heat
of
solar
irradiation
which
i
can
compare
to
nothing
but
the
scorching
sensation
experienced
in
america
at
a
temperature
twenty
degrees
higher
during
the
intervals
between
showers
or
before
a
rain
when
the
clear
blue
of
the
sky
seems
infinite
in
depth
and
transparency
such
circumstances
may
create
a
necessity
for
irrigation
where
it
would
otherwise
be
superfluous
if
not
absolutely
injurious
in
speaking
of
the
superior
apparent
clearness
of
the
in
america
i
confine
myself
to
the
concave
vault
of
the
heavens
and
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
terrestrial
objects
are
generally
visible
at
greater
distances
in
the
united
states
than
in
italy
indeed
i
am
rather
disposed
to
maintain
the
contrary
for
though
i
know
that
the
lower
strata
of
the
atmosphere
in
europe
never
equal
in
transparency
the
air
near
the
earth
in
new
mexico
peru
and

yet
i
think
the
accidents
of
the
coast
line
of
the
riviera
as
for
example
between
nice
and
la
spezia
and
those
of
the
incomparable
alpine
panorama
seen
from

are
distinguishable
at
greater
distances
than
they
would
be
in
the
united
states
in

evaporation
and
absorption
by
the
earth
are
so
rapid
that
all
annual
crops
require
irrigation
during
the
whole
period
of
their
growth
as
fast
as
the
water
retires

the
subsidence

the

the

then
by
this

is

that
of

smith
of

gives

as

of

german

fifteen
to

is
stated
to
contain

the

being

and
it
therefore
corresponds
almost
exactly
to
the
english
acre
hence
according
to
kremer
the
cultivable
soil
of
upper
egypt
is
square
statute
miles
or
twice
as
much
as
the
whole

of
the

between

and
the

of

according
to
smith
of

i
suspect
that
feddan
is
erroneously
given
as
the
cultivable
area
of
upper
egypt
alone
when
in
fact
it
should
be
taken
for
the
arable
surface
of
both
lower
and
upper
egypt
for
from
the
statistical
tables
in
the
same
volume
it
appears
that
feddan
or
square
statute
miles
were
cultivated
in
both
geographical
divisions
in
the
year
referred
to
in
the
tables
the
date
of
which
is
not
stated
the
area
which
the
nile
would
now
cover
at
high
water
if
left
to
itself
is
greater
than
in
ancient
times
because
the
bed
of
the
river
has
been
elevated
and
consequently
the
lateral
spread
of
the
inundation
increased
see

of

but
the
industry
of
the
egyptians
in

carried
the

large
provinces
which
have

relapsed

the
condition
of

anciently
observes
the

egypt

more
about
square
statute

have
been

in
the
best
days
of

probably
all
the
land
was
cultivated
that
could
be
made
available
for
agricultural
purposes
and
hence
we
may
estimate
the
ancient
arable
area
of
that
country
at
not
less
than
square
statute
miles
or
fully
double
its
present
extent
a

the
double
purpose
of
supplying

to

and

and
of
irrigating
the
adjacent

the
area
of
land
which
may
be
thus
reclaimed
and
fertilized
is
very
large
but
the
actual
quantity
which
it
will
be
found
economically
expedient
to
bring
under
cultivation
can
not
now
be
determined
the

doubtless
spread

the
entire

in

few
years
wilkinson
has
shown
that
the
cultivable
soil
of
egypt
has
not
been
diminished
by
encroachment
of
the
desert
sands
or
otherwise
but
that
on
the
contrary
it
must
have
been
increased
since
the
age
of
the
pharaohs
the
gotha
for
states
the
population
of
egypt
in
at
souls
but
this
must
be
a
great
exaggeration
even
supposing
the
estimate
to
include
the
inhabitants
of
nubia
and
of
much
other
territory
not
geographically
belonging
to
egypt
in
general
the
population
of
that
country
has
been
estimated
at
something
more
than
three
millions
or
about
six
hundred
to
the
square
mile
but
with
a
better
government
and
better
social
institutions
the
soil
would
sustain
a
much
greater
number
and
in
fact
it
is
believed
that
in
ancient
times
its
inhabitants
were
twice
perhaps
even
thrice
as
numerous
as
at
present
wilkinson
for
travellers
in
observes
that
the
total
population
which
two
hundred
years
ago
was
estimated
at
amounted
till
lately
only
to
about
souls
having
been
reduced
since
from
to
that
number
ritter
supposes
egypt
to
have
been
a
sandy
desert
when
it
was
first
occupied
by

the
first
inhabitant
of

as
his
neighbors

the

still
are
but
the
civilized
people
of
egypt
transformed
by
canals
the
waste
into
the
richest
granary
of
the
world
they
liberated
themselves
from
the
shackles
of
the
rock
and
sand
desert
in
the
midst
of
which
by
a
wise
distribution
of
the
fluid
through
the
solid
geographical
form
by
irrigation
in

they
created
a
region
of

this
view
seems
to
me
highly

for
though
by

man
has
done
much
to
modify
the
natural
distribution
of
the
waters
of
the
nile
and
possibly
has
even
transferred
its
channel
from
one
side
of
the
valley
to
the
other
yet
the
annual
inundation
is
not
his
work
and
the
river
must
have
overflowed
its
banks
and
carried
spontaneous
vegetation
with
its
waters
as
well
before
as
since
egypt
was

occupied
by
the

family
there
is
indeed
some
reason
to
suppose
that

lived
upon
the

of
the

when
its

was

lower

the

of

narrower

at

wherever

the

therefore
the

is

different
character
of
the

by
the

of
the

of

partly
by

its

successfully
applied
they
believe
that
the
constituents

are
washed
out

by
excessive
and
watering
they
consider
it
also
established
as
a
fact
of
observation
that
water
which
has
flowed
through
or
over
rich
ground
is
far
more
valuable
for
irrigation
than
water
from
the
same
source
which
has
not
been
impregnated
with
fertilizing
substances
by
passing
through
soils
containing
them
and
on
the
other
hand
that
water
rich
in
the
elements
of

parts
with
them
in
serving
to
irrigate
a
poor
soil
and
is
therefore
less
valuable
as

their
immensely
ramified
branches
and
the
grading
and
scarping
of
the
ground
to
be
watered
are
always
expensive
operations
and
they
very
often
require
an
amount
of
capital
which
can
be
commanded
only
by
the
state
by
moneyed
corporations
or
by
very
wealthy
proprietors
the
capacity
of
the
canals
must
be
calculated
with
reference
to
the
area
intended
to
be
irrigated
and
when
they
and
their
branches
are
once
constructed
it
is
very
difficult
to
extend
them
or
to
accommodate
any
of
their
original
arrangements
to
changes
in
the
condition
of
the
soil
or
in
the
modes
or
objects
of
cultivation
the
flow
of
the
water
being
limited
by
the
abundance
of
the
source
or
the
capacity
of
the
canals
the
individual
proprietor
can
not
be
allowed
to
withdraw
water
at
will
according
to
his
own
private
interest
or
convenience
but
both
the
time
and
the
quantity
of
supply
must
be
regulated
by
a
general
system
applicable
as
far
as
may
be
to
the
whole
area
irrigated
by
the
same
canal
and
every
cultivator
must
conform
his
industry
to
a
plan
which
may
be
quite
at
variance
with
his
special
objects
or
with
his
views
of
good
husbandry
the
clashing
interests
and
the
jealousies
of
proprietors
depending
on
the
same
means
of
supply
are
a
source
of
incessant
contention
and
litigation
and
the
caprices
or
partialities
of
the
officers
who
control
or
of
contractors
who
farm
the
canals
lead
not
unfrequently
to
ruinous
injustice
toward
individual
landholders
these
circumstances
discourage
the
division
of
the
soil
into
small
properties
and
there
is
a
constant
tendency
to
the
accumulation
of
large
estates
of
irrigated
land
in
the
hands
of
great
capitalists
and
consequently
to
the
dispossession
of
the
small
cultivators
who
pass
from
the
condition
of
owners
of
the
land
to
that
of
hireling
tillers
the
farmers
are
no
longer
yeomen
but
peasants
having
no
interest
in
the
soil
which
composes
their
country
they
are
virtually
expatriated
and
the
middle
class
which
ought
to
constitute
the
real
physical
and
moral
strength
of
the
land
ceases
to
exist
as
a
rural
estate
and
is
found
only
among
the
professional
the
mercantile
and
the
industrial

the
effect

without

which

do
much
deaden
the
violence
of
the

that
flow
from
them
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
all
rivers
excavate
their
own
valleys
for
i
have
no
doubt
that
in
the
majority
of
cases
such
depressions
of
the
surface
originate
in
higher
geological
causes
and
hence
the
valley
makes
the
river
not
the
river
the
valley
but
even
if
we
suppose
a
basin
of
the
hardest
rock
to
be
elevated
at
once
completely
formed
from
the
submarine
abyss
where
it
was
fashioned
the
first
shower
of
rain
that
falls
upon
it
after
it
rises
to
the
air
while
its
waters
will
follow
the
lowest
lines
of
the
surface
will
cut
those
lines
deeper
and
so
on
with
every
successive
rain
the
disintegrated
rock
from
the
upper
part
of
the
basin
forms
the
lower
by
alluvial
deposit
which
is
constantly
transported
farther
and
farther
until
the
resistance
of
gravitation
and
cohesion
balances
the
mechanical
force
of
the
running
water
thus
plains
more
or
less
steeply
inclined
are
formed
in
which
the
river
is
constantly
changing
its
bed
according
to
the
perpetually
varying
force
and
direction
of
its
currents
modified
as
they
are
by
conditions
thus
the
po
is
said
to
have
long
inclined
to
move
its
channel
southward
in
consequence
of
the
superior
mechanical
force
of
its
northern
affluents
a
diversion
of
these
tributaries
from
their
present
beds
so
that
they
should
enter
the
main
stream
at
other
points
and
in
different
directions
might
modify
the
whole
course
of
that
great
river
but
the
mechanical
force
of
the
tributary
is
not
the
only
element
of
its
influence
on
the
course
of
the
principal
stream
the
deposits
it
lodges
in
the
bed
of
the
latter
acting
as
simple
obstructions

causes
of

are
not
less
important

which
a
new
obstruction
to
the

of
a

by

in
its
channel
will
retard

very
numerous

have
been
erected
within

there
is
scarcely
a

in
the
settled
portion
of
the
country
which
has
not
several
milldams
upon
it
when
a

is
raised
a
process
which
the
gradual
diminution
of
the
summer
currents
renders
frequently
necessary
or
when

is
built
it
often
happens
that
the
meadows
above
are
flowed
or
that
the
retardation
of
the

extends
back
to
the

next
above
this
leads
to
frequent
lawsuits
from
the
great
uncertainty
of
the
facts
the
testimony
is
more
conflicting
in
these
than
in
any

the
obstinacy
with
which

become
proverbial

of

the
still
more
important
subject
of
the
absorption
of

its
transmission
by
infiltration
is
yet
wrapped
in
great
obscurity
the
sediment
of
the

has
filled
up
some
lagoons
and
swamps
in
its
delta
and
converted
them
into
comparatively
dry
land
but
on
the
other
hand
the
retardation
of
the
current
from
the
lengthening
of
its
course
and
the
diminution
of
its
velocity
by
the
deposits
at
its
mouth
have
forced
its
waters
at

from

does
this

derive
the

inches
of

does
it
appear
that
much
sediment
is
contributed
by
the
which
flows
through
forests
for
a
great
part
of
its
course
i
have
been
informed
by
an
old
european
resident
of
egypt
who
is
very
familiar
with
the
upper
nile
that
almost
the
whole
of
the
earth
with
which
its
waters
are
charged
is
brought
down
by
the
takazzé
it
is
very
probably
true
that
as
lombardini
supposes
the
plain
of
lombardy
was
anciently
covered
with
forests
and
morasses
baumgarten
but
had
the
po
remained
unconfined
its
deposits
would
have
raised
its
banks
as
fast
as
its
bed
and
there
is
no
obvious
reason
why
this
plain
should
be
more
marshy
than
other
alluvial
flats
traversed
by
great
rivers
its
lower
course
would
possibly
have
become
more
marshy
than
at
present
but
the
banks
of
its
middle
and
upper
course
would
have
been
in
a
better
condition
for
agricultural
use
than
they
now
are
from
daily
measurements
during
a
period
of
fourteen
years
to
the
mean
delivery
of
the
po
at
ponte
lagoscuro
below
the
entrance
of
its
last
tributary
is
found
to
be
cubic

its

its

or
cubic
baumgarten
following
lombardini
volume
before
cited
the
average
delivery
of
the
nile
being
cubic
feet
per
second
it
follows
that
the
po
contributes
to
the
adriatic
six
tenths
as
much
water
as
the
nile
to
the
mediterranean
a
result
which
will
surprise
most
readers
we
are
quite
safe
in
supposing
that
the
valley
of
the
nile
has
been
occupied
by
man
at
least
years
the
dates
of
egyptian
chronology
are
uncertain
but
i
believe
no
inquirer
estimates
the
age
of
the
great
pyramids
at
less
than
forty
centuries
and
the
construction
of
such
works
implies
an
already
ancient
civilization
there
are
many
dikes
in
egypt
but
they
are
employed
in
but
a
very
few
cases
to
exclude
the
waters
of
the
inundation
their
office
is
to
retain
the
water
received
at
high
nile
into
the
inclosures
formed
by
them
until
it
shall
have
deposited
its
sediment
or
been
drawn
out
for
irrigation
and
they
serve
also
as
causeways
for
interior
communication
during
the
floods
the
egyptian
dikes
therefore
instead
of
forcing
the
river
like
those
of
the
po
to
transport
its
sediment
to
the
sea
help
to
retain
the
slime
which
if
the
flow
of
the
current
over
the
land
were
not
obstructed
might
be
carried
back
into
the
channel
and
at
last
to
the
mediterranean
the
mediterranean
front
of
the
delta
may
be
estimated
at
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
length
two
cubic
miles
of
earth
would
more
than
fill
up
the
lagoons
on
the
coast
and
the
remaining
ten
even
allowing
the
mean
depth
of
the
water
to
be
twenty
fathoms
which
is
beyond
the
truth
would
have
been
sufficient
to
extend
the
coast
line
about
three
miles
farther
seaward
and
thus
including
the
land
gained
by
the
filling
up
of
the
lagoons
to
add
more
than
five
hundred
square
miles
to
the
area
of
egypt
nor
is
this
all
for
the
retardation
of
the
current
by
lengthening
the
course
and
consequently
diminishing
the
inclination
of
the
channel
would
have
increased
the
deposit
of
suspended
matter
and
proportionally
augmented
the
total
effect
of
the
embankment
for
the
convenience
of
navigation
and
to
lessen
the
danger
of
inundation
by
giving
greater
directness
and
of
course
rapidity
to
the
current
bends
in
rivers
are
sometimes
cut
off
and
winding
channels
made
straight
this
process
has
the
same
general
effects
as
diking
and
therefore
can
not
be
employed
without
many
of
the
same
results
this
practice
has
often
been
resorted
to
on
the
mississippi
with
advantage
to
navigation
but
it
is
quite
another
question
whether
that
advantage
has
not
been
too
dearly
purchased
by
the
injury
to
the
banks
at
lower
points
if
we
suppose
a
river
to
have
a
navigable
course
of
miles
as
measured
by
its
natural
channel
with
a
descent
of
feet
we
shall
have
a
fall
of
six
inches
to
the
mile
if
the
length
of
channel
be
reduced
to
miles
by
cutting
off
bends
the
fall
is
increased
to
eight
inches
per
mile
the
augmentation
of
velocity
consequent
upon
this
increase
of
inclination
is
not
computable
without
taking
into
account
other
elements
such
as
depth
and
volume
of
water
diminution
of
direct
resistance
and
the
like
but
in
almost
any
supposable
case
it
would
be
sufficient
to
produce
great
effects
on
the
height
of
floods
the
deposit
of
sediment
in
the
channel
on
the
shores
and
at
the
outlet
the
erosion
of
banks
and
other
points
of
much
geographical
importance
the
po
in
those
parts
of
its
course
where
the
embankments
leave
a
wide
space
between
often
cuts
off
bends
in
its
channel
and
straightens
its
course
these
short
cuts
are
called
or
leaps

sometimes

the
distance
between

termini

several

the
fact
that
the
mixing
of
salt
and
fresh
water
in
coast
marshes
and
lagoons
is
deleterious
to
the
sanitary
condition
of
the
vicinity
seems
almost
universally
admitted
though
the
precise
reason
why
a
mixture
of
both
should
be
more
injurious
than
either
alone
is
not
altogether
clear
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
admission
of
salt
water
to
the
lagoons
and
rivers
kills
many
fresh
water
plants
and
animals
while
the
fresh
water
is
equally
fatal
to
many
marine
organisms
and
that
the
decomposition
of
the
remains
originates
poisonous
miasmata
other
theories
however
have
been
proposed
the
whole
subject
is
fully
and
ably
discussed
by
salvagnoli
marchetti
in
the
appendix
to
his
valuable
sul

see
also
the

this
curious
fact
is
thus
stated
in
the
preface
to

sopra

edition
of
xiii
from
which
also
i
borrow
most
of
the
data
hereafter
given
with
respect
to
that
valley
it
is
perhaps
not
universally
known
that
the
swallows
which
come
from
the
north
south
to
spend
the
summer
in
our
climate
do
not
frequent
marshy
districts
with
a
malarious
atmosphere
a
proof
of
the
restoration
of
salubrity
in
the
val
di
chiana
is
furnished
by
these
aerial
visitors
which
had
never
before
been
seen
in
those
low
grounds
but
which
have
appeared
within
a
few
years
at
forano
and
other
points
similarly
situated
is
the
air
of
swamps
destructive
to
the
swallows
or
is
their
absence
in
such
localities
merely
due
to
the
want
of
human
habitations
near
which
this
bird
loves
to
breed
perhaps
because
the
house
fly
and
other
insects
which
follow
man
are
found
only
in
the
vicinity
of
his
dwellings
in
almost
all
european
countries
the
swallow
is
protected
by
popular
opinion
or
superstition
from
the
persecution
to
which
almost
all
other
birds
are
subject
it
is
possible
that
this
respect
for
the
swallow
is
founded
upon
ancient
observation
of
the
fact
just
stated
on
the
authority
of
fossombroni
ignorance
mistakes
the
effect
for
the
cause
and
the
absence
of
this
bird
may
have
been
supposed
to
be
the
occasion
not
the
consequence
of
the
unhealthiness
of
particular
localities
this
opinion
once
adopted
the
swallow
would
become
a
sacred
bird
and
in
process
of
time
fables
and
legends
would
be
invented
to
give
additional
sanction
to
the
prejudices
which
protected
it
the
romans
considered
the
swallow
as
consecrated
to
the
penates
or
household
gods
and
according
to

think
it

observer
from
the
stained
and
turbid
character
of
the
water
for
many
miles
from
its
mouths
a
somewhat
alarming
phenomenon
was
observed
in
this
neighborhood
in
on
board
the
english
frigate
romulus
captain
culverhouse
on
a
voyage
from
acre
to
abukir
clarke
who
was
a
passenger
on
board
this
ship
thus
describes
it
sunday
we
accompanied
the
captain
to
the
wardroom
to
dine
as
usual
with
his
officers
while
we
were
at
table
we
heard
the
sailors
who
were
throwing
the
lead
suddenly
cry
out
three
and
a
half
the
captain
sprang
up
was
on
deck
in
an
instant
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
ship
slackened
her
way
and
veered
about
every
sailor
on
board
supposed
she
would
ground
at
once
meanwhile
however
as
the
ship
came
round
the
whole
surface
of
the
water
was
seen
to
be
covered
with
thick
black
mud
which
extended
so
far
that
it
appeared
like
an
island
at
the
same
time
actual
land
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
not
even
from
the
masthead
nor
was
any
notice
of
such
a
shoal
to
be
found
on
any
chart
on
board
the
fact
is
as
we
learned
afterward
that
a
stratum
of
mud
stretching
from
the
mouths
of
the
nile
for
many
miles
out
into
the
open
sea
forms
a
movable
deposit
along
the
egyptian
coast
if
this
deposit
is
driven
forward
by
powerful
currents
it
sometimes
rises
to
the
surface
and
disturbs
the
mariner
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
shoals
where
the
charts
lead
him
to
expect
a
considerable
depth
of
water
but
these
strata
of
mud
are
in
reality
not
in
the
least
dangerous
as
soon
as
a
ship
strikes
them
they
break
up
at
once
and
a
frigate
may
hold
her
course
in
perfect
safety
where
an
inexperienced
pilot
misled
by
his
soundings
would
every
moment
expect
to
be
stranded

the
caves
of
carniola
receive
considerable
rivers
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
which
can
not
in
all
cases
be
identified
with
streams
flowing
out
of
them
at
other
points
and
like
phenomena
are
not
uncommon
in
other
limestone
countries
the
cases
are
certainly
not
numerous
where
marine
currents
are
known
to
pour
continuously
into
cavities
beneath
the
surface
of
the
earth
but
there
is
at
least
one
instance
of
this
sort
that
of
the
mill
streams
at
argostoli
in
the
island
of
cephalonia
it
had
been
long
observed
that
the
sea
water
flowed
into
several
rifts
and
cavities
in
the
limestone
rocks
of
the
coast
but
the
phenomenon
has
excited
little
attention
until
very
recently
in
three
of
the
entrances
were
closed
and
a
regular
channel
sixteen
feet
long
and
three
feet
wide
with
a
fall
of
three
feet
was
cut
into
the
mouth
of
a
larger
cavity
the
sea
water
flowed
into
this
canal
and
could
be
followed
eighteen
or
twenty
feet
beyond
its
inner
terminus
when
it
disappeared
in
holes
and
clefts
in
the
rock
in
the
canal
had
been
enlarged
to
the
width
of
five
feet
and
a
half
and
a
depth
of
a
foot
the
water
pours
rapidly
through
the
canal
into
an
irregular
depression
and
forms
a
pool
the
surface
of
which
is
three
or
four
feet
below
the
adjacent
soil
and
about
two
and
a
half
or
three
feet
below
the
level
of
the
sea
from
this
pool
it
escapes
through
several
holes
and
clefts
in
the
rock
and
has
not
yet
been
found
to
emerge
elsewhere
there
is
a
tide
at
argostoli
of
about
six
inches
in
still
weather
but
it
is
considerably
higher
with
a
south
wind
i
do
not
find
it
stated
whether
water
flows
through
the
canal
into
the
cavity
at
low
tide
but
it
distinctly
appears
that
there
is
no
refluent
current
as
of
course
there
could
not
be
from
a
basin
so
much
below
the
sea
mousson

the
delivery
through

canal
to
be
at
the

of

the

stage
of
the
tide
does
not
appear
other
mills
of
the
same
sort
have
been
erected
and
there
appear
to
be
several
points
on
the
coast
where
the
sea
flows
into
the
land
various
hypotheses
have
been
suggested
to
explain
this
phenomenon
some
of
which
assume
that
the
water
descends
to
a
great
depth
beneath
the
crust
of
the
earth
but
the
supposition
of
a
difference
of
level
in
the
surface
of
the
sea
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
island
which
seems
confirmed
by
other
circumstances
is
the
most
obvious
method
of
explaining
these
singular
facts
if
we
suppose
the
level
of
the
water
on
one
side
of
the
island
to
be
raised
by
the
action
of
currents
three
or
four
feet
higher
than
on
the
other
the
existence
of
cavities
and
channels
in
the
rock
would
easily
account
for
a
subterranean
current
beneath
the
island
and
the
apertures
of
escape
might
be
so
deep
or
so
small
as
to
elude
observation

the
affluents

that
the

this
supposes
a
much
greater
amount
of
evaporation
than
has
been

computed

i
believe
it
is
well

that
the

much
more

is

this
opinion
if
locally
true
can
not
be
generally
so
for
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
fact
that
the
very
first
eruption
of

from
a

often
brings
up
leaves
and
other
objects
which
must
have
been
carried

reservoirs
by

it
does
not
appear
whether
this
inference
is
mariotte
or
wittwer

it
is
a

the

the

arm

if

in

near
the

level
it
soon
fills
with
water
so
fresh
as
not
to
be
undrinkable
though
the

water
two

from

even
more
than
the

by

it
can
only
come
from

it
would
seem
that
there
must
exist
some
large
reservoir
in
the
interior
to
furnish
a
supply
which
in
spite
of
evaporation
holds
out
for
months
after
the
last

perhaps
even
through

the

sea

not
known
by

measurement
but
the
mass
of
debris
brought
down

the
torrents
proves
that
their
volume
must
be
large
the
proportion
of
surface
covered
by
sand
and
absorbent
earth
in
arabia
petræa
and
the
neighboring
countries
is
small
and
the
mountains
drain
themselves
rapidly
into
the
wadies

ravines
where
the
torrents
are
formed
but
the
beds
of
earth
and
disintegrated
rock
at
the
bottom
of
the
valleys
are
of
so
loose
and
porous
texture
that
a
great
quantity
of
water
is
absorbed
in
saturating
them
before
a
visible
current
is
formed
on
their
surface
in
a
heavy

accompanied
by
a

i
witnessed

if

accumulations
at

of
raising
it
unmixed
from

occasioned
by
the
abstraction
of

from

the
conditions
favorable
to
the
production
of
sand
from
disintegrated
rock
by
causes
now
in
action
are
perhaps
nowhere
more
perfectly
realized
than
in
the
sinaitic
peninsula
the
mountains
are
steep
and
lofty
unprotected
by
vegetation
or
even
by
a
coating
of
earth
and
the
rocks
which
compose
them
are
in
a
shattered
and
fragmentary
condition
they
are
furrowed
by
deep
and
precipitous
ravines
with
beds
sufficiently
inclined
for
the
rapid
flow
of
water
and
generally
without
basins
in
which
the
larger
blocks
of
stone
rolled
by
the
torrents
can
be
dropped
and
left
in
repose
there
are
severe
frosts
and
much
snow
on
the
higher
summits
and
ridges
and
the
winter
rains
are
abundant
and
heavy
the
mountains
are
principally
of
igneous
formation
but
many
of
the
less
elevated
peaks
are
capped
with
sandstone
and
on
the
eastern
slope
of
the
peninsula
you
may
sometimes
see
at
a
single
glance
several
lofty
pyramids
of
granite
separated
by
considerable
intervals
and
all
surmounted
by
horizontally
stratified
deposits
of
sandstone
often
only
a
few
yards
square
which
correspond
to
each
other
in
height
are
evidently
contemporaneous
in
origin
and
were
once
connected
in
continuous
beds
the
degradation
of
the
rock
on
which
this
formation
rests
is
constantly
bringing
down
masses
of
it
and
mingling
them
with
the
basaltic
porphyritic
granitic
and
calcareous
fragments
which
the
torrents
carry
down
to
the
valleys
and
through
them
in
a
state
of
greater
or
less
disintegration
to
the
sea
the
quantity
of
sand
annually
washed
into
the
red
sea
by
the
larger
torrents
of
the
lesser
peninsula
is
probably
at
least
equal
to
that
contributed
to
the
ocean
by
any
streams
draining
basins
of
no
greater
extent
absolutely
considered
then
the
mass
may
be
said
to
be
large
but
it
is
apparently
very
small
as
compared
with
the
sand
thrown
up
by
the
german
ocean
and
the
atlantic
on
the
coasts
of
denmark
and
of
france
there
are
indeed
in
arabia

many
torrents
with
very
short
courses
for
the
sea
waves
in
many
parts
of
the
peninsular
coast
wash
the
base
of
the
mountains
in
these
cases
the
debris
of
the
rocks
do
not
reach
the
sea
in
a
sufficiently
comminuted
condition
to
be
entitled
to
the
appellation
of
sand
or
even
in
the
form
of
pebbles
the
fragments
retain
their
angular
shape
and
at
some
points
on
the
coast
they
become
cemented
together
by
lime
or
other
binding
substances
held
in
solution
or
mechanical
suspension
in
the
sea
water
and
are
so
rapidly
converted
into
a
singularly
heterogeneous
conglomerate
that
one
deposit
seems
to
be
consolidated
into
a
breccia
before
the
next
torrents
cover
it
with
another
in
the
northern
part
of
the
peninsula
there
are
extensive
deposits
of
sand
intermingled
with
agate
pebbles
and
petrified
wood
but
these
are
evidently
neither
derived
from
the
sinaitic
group
nor
products
of
local
causes
known
to
be
now
in
action
i
may
here
notice
the
often
repeated
but
mistaken
assertion
that
the
petrified
wood
of
the
western
arabian
desert
consists
wholly
of
the
stems
of
palms
or
at
least
of
endogenous
vegetables
this
is
an
error
i
have
myself
picked
up
in
that
desert
within
the
space
of
a
very
few
square
yards
fragments
both
of
fossil
palms
and
of
at
least
two
petrified
trees
distinctly
marked
as
of
exogenous
growth
both
by
annular
structure
and
by
knots
in
ligneous
character
one
of
these
almost
precisely
resembles
the
grain
of
the
extant
beech
and
this
specimen
was
wormeaten
before
it
was
converted
into
silex
böttger
the
testimony
of
divers
and
of
other
observers
on
this
point
is
conflicting
as
might
be
expected
from
the
infinite
variety
of
conditions
by
which
the
movement
of
water
is
affected
it
is
generally
believed
that
the
action
of
the
wind
upon
the
water
is
not
perceptible
at
greater
depths
than
from
fifteen
feet
in
ordinary
to
eighty
or
ninety
in
extreme
cases
but
these
estimates
are
probably
very
considerably
below
the
truth
andresen
quotes
brémontier
as
stating
that
the
movement
of
the
waves
sometimes
extends
to
the
depth
of
five
hundred
feet
and
he
adds
that
others
think
it
may
reach
to
six
or
even
seven
hundred
feet
below
the
andresen
many
physicists
now
suppose
that
the
undulations
of
great
bodies
of
water
reach
even
deeper
but
a
movement
of
undulation
is
not
necessarily
a
movement
of
translation
and
besides
there
is
very
frequently
an
undertow
which
tends
to
carry
suspended
bodies
out
to
sea
as
powerfully
as
the
superficial
waves

throw
them
on

is
less

at
some

they
only
roll

andresen
says
that
a

strong
enough
to
raise
particles
of
sand
as
high
as

that
in
general
it
rolls
along

is
scarcely
ever
thrown
more
than
to
the
height
of
a
couple
of
yards
from
the

even
in
these
cases
it
is
carried
forward
by
a
hopping
not
a
continuous
motion

very
narrow
sheet

channel
of
water
stops
the
drift
entirely
all
the
sand
dropping
into
it
until
it
is
filled
up
the
character
of
the
motion
of

drifts
is
well
illustrated
by
an
interesting
fact
not
much
noticed
hitherto

in

situations

the

driven

there
are
various
reasons
why
the
formation
of
dunes
is
confined
to
low
shores
and
this
law
is
so
universal
that
when
bluffs
are
surmounted
by
them
there
is
always
cause
to
suspect
upheaval
or
the
removal
of
a
sloping
beach
in
front
of
the
bluff
after
the
dunes
were
formed
bold
shores
are
usually
without
a
sufficient
beach
for
the
accumulation
of
large
deposits
they
are
commonly
washed
by
a
sea
too
deep
to
bring
up
sand
from
its
bottom
their
abrupt
elevation
even
if
moderate
in
amount
would
still
be
too
great
to
allow
ordinary
winds
to
lift
the
sand
above
them
and
their
influence
in
deadening
the
wind
which
blows
toward
them
would
even
more
effectually
prevent
the
raising
of
sand
from
the
beach
at
their
foot
forchhammer
describing
the
coast
of
jutland
says
that
in
high
winds
one
can
hardly
stand
upon
the
dunes
except
when
they
are
near
the
water
line
and
have
been
cut
down
perpendicularly
by
the
waves
then
the
wind
is
little
or
not
at
all
felt
a
fact
of
experience
very
common
on
our
coasts
observed
on
all
the
steep
shore
bluffs
of
two
hundred
feet
in
height
and
in
the
faroe
islands
on
precipices
two
thousand
feet
high
in
heavy
gales
in
those
islands
the
cattle
fly
to
the
very
edge
of
the
cliffs
for
shelter
and
frequently
fall
over
the
wind
impinging
against
the
vertical
wall
creates
an
ascending
current
which
shoots
somewhat
past
the
crest
of
the
rock
and
thus
the
observer
or
the
animal
is
protected
against
the
tempest

the
calming
or
rather
diversion
of
the
wind
by

extends
to
a
considerable
distance
in

of

no
wind
would
have
sufficient
force
to
raise
the
sand
vertically
parallel
to
the
face
of
a

even
to
the
height
of

feet
it
is
very
commonly
believed
that
it
is
impossible
to
grow
forest
trees
on
bluffs
or
points
much
exposed
to
strong
winds
the
observations
just
cited
tend
to
show
that
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
protect
trees
from
the
mechanical
effect
of
the
wind
by
screens
much
lower
than
the
height
to
which
they
are
expected
to

recent
experiments
confirm
this
and
it
is
found
that
though
the
outer
row
or
rows
may
suffer
from
the
wind
every
tree
shelters
a
taller
one
behind
it
extensive

been
formed

ascribes
the
resemblance
between

sands

ripples
not

the
similarity
of
the
effect
of

the

some

proper
penalties
for
disobedience
being
as
regular
a
public
tax
as
any

people
therefore
generally
attended
and
performed
the
labor
the
grass
was
dug
in
bunches
as
it
naturally
grows
and
each
bunch
divided
into
a
number
of
smaller
ones
these
were
set
out
in

that
they
bend

sixteen
years

says
an

landholder
i
attempted
to
fix
the
sand
of
the
steppes
which
covers
the
rocky
ground
to
the
depth
of
a
foot

forms

hillocks

tried
acacias

pines
in

nothing
would
grow
in
such
a
soil
at
length
i
planted
the
varnish
tree
or
which
succeeded
completely
in
binding
the
sand
this
result
encouraged
the
proprietor
to
extend
his
plantations
over
both
dunes
and
sand
steppes
and
in
the
course
of
sixteen
years
this
rapidly
growing
tree
had
formed
real
forests
other

have
imitated
his

follow
its

it
may
be
questioned
whether
the
epithet

by

to
the
original
surface
necessarily
implies
that
it
was
covered
with

the

mentioned
in

the
distance
to
which
lava
flows
before
its
surface
begins
to
solidify
depends
on
its
volume
its
composition
its
temperature
and
that
of
the
air
the
force
with
which
it
is
ejected
and
the
inclination
of
the
declivity
over
which
it
runs
in
most
cases
it
is
difficult
to
approach
the
current
at
points
where
it
is
still
entirely
fluid
and
hence
opportunities
of
observing
it
in
that
condition
are
not
very
frequent
in
the
eruption
of
february
on
the
east
side
of
vesuvius
i
went
quite
up
to
one
of
the
outlets
the
lava
shot
out
of
the
orifice
upward
with
great
velocity
like
the
water
from
a
spring
in
a
stream
eight
or
ten
feet
in
diameter
throwing
up
occasionally
volcanic
bombs
but
it
immediately
spread
out
on
the
declivity
down
which
it
flowed
to
the
width
of
several
yards
it
continued
red
hot
in
broad
daylight
and
without
a
particle
of
scoriæ
on
its
surface
for
a
course
of
at
least
one
hundred
yards
at
this
distance
the
suffocating
sulphurous
vapors
became
so
dense
that
i
could
follow
the
current
no
farther
the
undulations
of
the
surface
were
like
those
of
a
brook
swollen
by
rain
i
estimated
the
height
of
the
waves
at
five
or
six
inches
by
a
breadth
of
eighteen
or
twenty
to
the
eye
the
fluidity
of
the
lava
seemed
as
perfect
as
that
of
water
but
masses
of
cold
lava
weighing
ten
or
fifteen
pounds
floated
upon
it
like
cork
the
heat
emitted
by
lava
currents
seems
extremely
small
when
we
consider
the
temperature
required
to
fuse
such

great

i
take
the
following
account
of
a
case
of
this
sort
from
a
recent
american
journal
a
curious
when
the
track
of
the
railroad
between
brunswick
and
bath
was
being
graded
in
crossing
a
meadow
near
the
populous
portion
of
the
latter
city
the
suddenly
took
on
a
sinking
symptom
and
down
went
the
twenty
feet
fill
of
gravel
clay
and
broken
rocks
out
of
sight
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
dirt
trains
could
fill
the
capacious
stomach
that
seemed
ready
to
receive
all
the
solid
material
that
could
be
turned
into
it
the
difficulty
was
at
length
overcome
but
all
along
the
side
of
the
sinkage
the
earth
was
thrown
up
broken
into
yawning
chasms
and
the
surface
was
thus
elevated
above
its
old
watery
level
since
that
time
this
ground
thus
slightly
elevated
has
been
cultivated
and
has
yielded
enormously
of
whatever
the
owner
seemed
disposed
to
plant
upon
it
some
three
months
ago
by
some
means
unknown
to
us
the
underlying
peat
took
fire
and
for
weeks
as
we
had
occasion
to
pass
it
we
noticed
the
smoke
arising
from
the
smouldering
combustion
beneath
the
surface
rains
fell
but
the
fire
burned
and
the
smoke
continued
to
arise
monday
we
had
occasion
to
pass
the
spot
and
though
nearly
a
week
rain
had
been
drenching
the
ground
and
though
the
surface
was
whitened
with
snow
and
though
pools
of
water
were
standing
upon
the
surface
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
still
the
everlasting
subterranean
fire
was
burning
and
the
smoke
arising
through
the
snow
one
of
the
sublimest
and
at
the
same
time
most
fearful
suggestions
that
have
been
prompted
by
the
researches
of
modern
science
was
made
by
babbage
in
the
ninth
chapter
of
his
bridgewater
i
have
not
the
volume
at
hand
but
the
following
explanation
will
recall
to
the
reader
if
it
does
not
otherwise
make
intelligible
the
suggestion
i
refer
to
no
atom
can
be
disturbed
in
place
or
undergo
any
change
of
temperature
of
electrical
state
or
other
material
condition
without
affecting
by
attraction
or
repulsion
or
other
communication
the
surrounding
atoms
these
again
by
the
same
law
transmit
the
influence
to
other
atoms
and
the
impulse
thus
given
extends
through
the
whole
material
universe
every
human
movement
every
organic
act
every
volition
passion
or
emotion
every
intellectual
process
is
accompanied
with
atomic
disturbance
and
hence
every
such
movement
every
such
act
or
process
affects
all
the
atoms
of
universal
matter
though
action
and
reaction
are
equal
yet
reaction
does
not
restore
disturbed
atoms
to
their
former
place
and
condition
and
consequently
the
effects
of
the
least
material
change
are
never
cancelled
but
in
some
way
perpetuated
so
that
no
action
can
take
place
in
physical
moral
or
intellectual
nature
without
leaving
all
matter
in
a
different
state
from
what
it
would
have
been
if
such
action
had
not
occurred
hence
to
use
language
which
i
have
employed
on
another
occasion
there
exists
not
alone
in
the
human
conscience
or
in
the
omniscience
of
the
creator
but
in
external
material
nature
an
ineffaceable
imperishable
record
possibly
legible
even
to
created
intelligence
of
every
act
done
every
word
uttered
nay
of
every
wish
and
purpose
and
thought
conceived
by
mortal
man
from
the
birth
of
our
first
parent
to
the
final
extinction
of
our
race
so
that
the
physical
traces
of
our
most
secret
sins
shall
last
until
time
shall
be
merged
in
that
eternity
of
which
not
science

alone
assumes

the
cases

about

there
is
no

doubt
that
these
differences
are
due
to
the
draining
of
the

there
has
been
less

the

reason

that

rate
not

proposes
the
construction

by
rolling

attrition

at
the

the

deposit
which
is
to
be
mixed
with
the
calcareous
slime
and
distributed
over
the

by
watercourses
constructed
for
the
purpose
by
this
means
he
supposes
that
a
highly
fertile
soil
could
be
formed
on
the

which
would
also
be
so
raised

process
as
to

recommend

it

an

the
distribution

shells
is
well
worthy
of
notice
as
a
geological
fact
cape
cod
the
right
arm
of
the
commonwealth
reaches
out
into
the
ocean
some
fifty
or
sixty
miles
it
is
nowhere
many
miles
wide
but
this
narrow
point
of
land
has
hitherto
proved
a
barrier
to
the
migration
of
many
species
of
mollusca
several
genera
and
numerous
species
which
are
separated
by
the
intervention
of
only
a
few
miles
of
land
are
effectually
prevented
from
mingling
by
the
cape
and
do
not
pass
from
one
side
to
the
other
of
the
one
hundred
and
marine
species
do
not
pass
to
the
south
shore
and
fifty
are
not
found
on
the
north
shore
of
the
cape
probably
the
distribution
of
the
species
of
mollusks
is
affected
by
unknown
local
conditions
and
therefore
an
open
canal
across
the
cape
might
not
make
every
species
that
inhabits
the
waters
on
one
side
common
to
those
of
the
other
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
there
would
be
a
considerable
migration
in
both
directions
the
fact
stated
in
the
report
may
suggest
an
important
caution
in
drawing
conclusions
upon
the
relative
age

a

naturalists

from
the
character

might
have
assigned
them

the
object
of
this
work
is
to
exhibit
cicero
not
merely
as
a
statesman
and
an
orator
but
as
he
was
at
home
in
the
relations
of
private
life
as
a
husband
a
father
a
brother
and
a
friend
his
letters
are
full
of
interesting
details
which
enable
us
to
form
a
vivid
idea
of
how
the
old
romans
lived
years
ago
and
the
biography
embraces
not
only
a
history
of
events
as
momentous
as
any
in
the
annals
of
the
world
but
a
large
amount
of
anecdote
and
gossip
which
amused
the
generation
that
witnessed
the
downfall
of
the
republic
the
says
forsyth
has
rightly
aimed
to
set
before
us
a
portrait
of
cicero
in
the
modern
style
of
biography
carefully
gleaning
from
his
extensive
correspondence
all
those
little
traits
of
character
and
habit
which
marked
his
private
and
domestic
life
these
volumes
form
a
very
acceptable
addition
to
the
classic
library
the
style
is
that
of
a
scholar
and
a
man
of
taste
from
the
forsyth
has
discreetly
told
his
story
evenly
and
pleasantly
supplied
it
with
apt
illustrations
from
modern
law
eloquence
and
history
and
brought
cicero
as
near
to
the
present
time
as
the
differences
of
age
and
manners
warrant
these
volumes
we
heartily
recommend
as
both
a
useful
and
agreeable
guide
to
the
writings
and
character
of
one
who
was
next
in
intellectual
and
political
rank
to
the
foremost
man
of
all
the
world
at
a
period
when
there
were
many
to
dispute
with
him
the
triple
crown
of
forensic
philosophic
and
political
composition
a
scholar
without
pedantry
and
a
christian
without
cant
forsyth
seems
to
have
seized
with
praiseworthy
tact
the
precise
attitude
which
it
behoves
a
biographer
to
take
when
narrating
the
life
the
personal
life
of
cicero
forsyth
produces
what
we
venture
to
say
will
become
one
of
classics
of
english
biographical
and
will
be
welcomed
by
readers
of
all
ages
and
both
sexes
of
all
professions
and
of
no
profession
at
all
this
book
is
a
valuable
contribution
to
our
standard
literature
it
is
a
work
which
will
aid
our
progress
towards
the
truth
it
lifts
a
corner
of
the
veil
which
has
hung
over
the
scenes
and
actors
of
times
so
full
of
ferment
and
allows
us
to
catch

it

eminently
attractive
it
is

it
is
immeasurably
nearer
than

we
think
that
lord

translation
will
not
only
be
read
but
read
over
and
over
again
lord

has
given
to

a
version
far
more
closely
allied
to

superior
to

we
find
ourselves
in
a
purer
atmosphere
of
taste
we
find
more
spirit
more
tact
in
avoiding
either
trivial
or
conceited
phrases
and
altogether
a
presence
of
merits
and
an
absence
of
defects
which
continues
as
we
read
to
lengthen
more
and

distance
between
lord

the
versification
of

is

his

is
in
all
other
essentials
superior
to
that
of
his
great

for
the
rest
if
pope
is
dethroned
what
remains
it
is
the
iliad
we
would
place
in
the
hands
of

as
the
truest
counterpart
of

among

also
its
treasures
lord
derby
translation
of

must
occupy
a
very
conspicuous
place
lord
derby
work
is
on
the
whole
more
remarkable
for
the
constancy
of
its
excellence
and
the
high
level
which
it
maintains
throughout
than
for
its
special
bursts
of
eloquence
it
is
uniformly
worthy
of
itself
and
its
author
whatever
may
be
the
ultimate
fate
of
this
poem
whether
it
take
sufficient
hold
of
the
public
mind
to
satisfy
that
demand
for
a
translation
of
homer
which
we
have
alluded
to
and
thus
become
a
permanent
classic
of
the
language
or
whether
it
give
place
to
the
still
more
perfect
production
of
some
yet
unknown
poet
it
must
equally
be
considered
a
splendid
performance
and
for
the
present
we
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
it
is
by
far
the
best
representation
of
