i
the
perfect
boarding
house
it
is
queer
but
captain
cy
himself
does
remember
whether
the
day
was
tuesday
or
wednesday
asaph
tidditt
records
ought
to
settle
it
for
there
was
a
meeting
of
the
board
of
selectmen
that
day
and
asaph
has
been
town
clerk
in
bayport
since
the
summer
before
the
baptist
meeting
house
burned
but
on
the
record
the
date
in
asaph
handwriting
stands
tuesday
may
and
as
it
happens
may
of
that
year
fell
on
wednesday
not
tuesday
at
all
keturah
bangs
who
keeps
the
perfect
boarding
house
says
it
was
tuesday
because
she
remembers
they
had
fried
cod
cheeks
and
cabbage
that
day
as
they
have
every
tuesday
and
neither
tidditt
nor
bailey
bangs
keturah
husband
was
on
hand
when
the
dinner
bell
rang
keturah
says
she
is
certain
it
was
tuesday
because
she
remembers
smelling
the
boiled
cabbage
as
she
stood
at
the
side
door
looking
up
the
road
to
see
if
either
asaph
or
bailey
was
coming
as
for
bailey
he
says
he
remembers
being
late
to
dinner
and
his
wife
startin
to
heave
a
broadsides
into
him
because
of
it
but
he
does
remember
what
day
it
was
this
is
surprising
keturah
verbal
cannonades
are
likely
to
make
one
forgetful
of
trifles
at
any
rate
whether
tuesday
or
wednesday
it
is
certain
that
it
was
quarter
past
twelve
according
to
the
clock
presented
to
the
methodist
society
by
the
honorable
heman
atkins
when
asaph
tidditt
came
down
the
steps
of
the
townhall
after
the
selectmen
meeting
and
saw
bailey
bangs
waiting
for
him
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
hello
ase
hailed
bangs
you
be
late
to
dinner
if
you
hurry
i
was
headin
for
home
all
sail
sot
when
i
see
you
what
kept
you
town
business
of
course
replied
tidditt
with
the
importance
pertaining
to
his
official
position
what
kept
you
for
the
land
sakes
wo
ketury
be
in
your
wool
bailey
has
any
wool
worth
mentioning
now
and
he
had
very
little
more
then
but
he
mopped
his
forehead
or
the
extension
above
it
taking
off
his
cap
to
do
so
i
she
will
he
said
uneasily
tell
you
the
truth
ase
i
was
up
to
the
store
and
josiah
dimick
and
some
more
of
drifted
in
and
we
got
talkin
about
the
chances
of
the
harbor
appropriation
and
one
thing
or
and
was
i
thought
i
knew
the
appropriation
from
the
government
which
was
to
deepen
and
widen
our
harbor
here
at
bayport
was
a
very
vital
topic
among
us
just
then
heman
atkins
the
congressman
from
our
district
had
promised
to
do
his
best
for
the
appropriation
and
had
for
a
time
been
very
sanguine
of
securing
it
recently
however
he
had
not
been
quite
as
hopeful
what
josiah
think
about
the
chances
asked
asaph
eagerly
well
sometimes
he
thinks
and
then
again
he
thinks
replied
bailey
he
says
of
course
if
heman
is
able
to
get
it
he
will
but
if
he
ai
able
to
he
he
he
wo
i
well
can
think
that
myself
and
i
do
set
up
to
be
no
inspired
like
joe
dimick
he
ai
heard
from
heman
lately
has
he
no
he
ai
neither
anybody
else
so
fur
as
i
can
find
oh
yes
they
have
have
for
bangs
stopped
short
in
his
march
for
home
and
dinner
and
looked
his
companion
in
the
face
ase
tidditt
he
cried
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
had
a
letter
from
heman
atkins
from
asaph
nodded
portentously
yes
sir
he
declared
a
letter
from
the
honorable
heman
atkins
of
come
to
me
last
night
i
read
it
afore
i
turned
you
did
and
never
said
nothin
about
it
why
should
i
say
anything
about
it
was
addressed
to
me
as
town
clerk
and
was
concernin
a
matter
to
be
took
up
with
the
board
of
i
ai
in
the
habit
of
hollerin
town
affairs
through
a
speakin
trumpet
folks
that
vote
for
me
day
know
that
i
guess
angie
phinney
says
to
me
only
yesterday
tidditt
says
she
one
thing
i
say
for
you
you
do
talk
miss
phinney
boarded
with
the
bangses
and
bailey
was
acquainted
with
her
personal
peculiarities
for
that
matter
so
were
most
of
permanent
residents
humph
he
snorted
indignantly
she
thought
was
a
good
thing
not
to
talk
hey
she
did
well
by
mighty
you
never
get
no
chance
to
talk
when
she
around
angie
phinney
why
when
that
poll
parrot
of
hers
died
smalley
declared
up
and
down
that
what
killed
it
was
jealousy
and
ambition
he
said
it
broke
its
heart
tryin
to
keep
up
with
angie
her
ma
was
the
same
breed
of
cats
i
remember
the
talking
proclivities
of
females
is
the
one
topic
upon
which
keturah
husband
is
touchiest
asaph
knew
this
but
he
delighted
to
stir
up
his
chum
occasionally
he
chuckled
as
he
interrupted
the
flow
of
reminiscence
there
there
bailey
he
exclaimed
i
know
as
much
about
tribe
as
you
do
i
ai
we
a
little
mite
off
the
course
seems
to
me
we
was
talkin
about
heman
is
that
so
i
judged
from
what
you
said
we
goin
to
talk
about
it
aw
do
be
so
mean
ase
showin
off
your
importance
like
a
young
one
what
did
heman
say
about
the
appropriation
is
he
goin
to
get
it
tidditt
paused
before
replying
then
bending
over
he
whispered
in
his
chum
ear
he
never
said
one
word
about
the
appropriation
bailey
not
one
word
he
wanted
to
know
if
we
got
this
year
taxes
on
the
whittaker
place
and
if
we
had
what
was
we
goin
to
do
about
it
bailey
between
you
and
me
and
the
mizzenmast
heman
atkins
wants
to
get
ahold
of
that
place
the
worst
he
does
he
does
for
the
land
sakes
ai
he
got
property
enough
already
ai
a
a
palace
like
that
enough
for
one
man
without
to
buy
a
rattletrap
like
that
the
first
that
was
emphasized
by
a
brandished
but
reverent
left
hand
the
second
by
a
derisively
pointing
right
the
two
friends
had
reached
the
crest
of
the
long
slope
leading
up
from
the
townhall
on
one
side
of
the
road
stretched
the
imposing
frontage
of
the
atkins
estate
with
its
iron
fence
and
stone
posts
on
the
other
slouched
the
desolation
of
the
cy
whittaker
the
contrast
was
that
of
opulent
prosperity
and
neglect
if
our
village
boasted
one
of
those
horseless
juggernauts
such
as
are
used
to
carry
sightseers
in
boston
from
the
old
north
church
to
the
public
library
and
other
points
of
interest
that
is
if
there
was
a
seeing
bayport
car
it
is
from
this
hill
that
its
occupants
would
be
given
their
finest
view
of
the
village
and
its
surroundings
as
captain
josiah
dimick
always
says
bayport
is
all
north
and
south
like
a
codfish
line
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
seth
higgins
oldest
boy
he
was
so
tall
and
thin
that
when
they
bought
a
suit
of
clothes
for
him
they
used
to
take
reefs
in
the
sides
of
the
jacket
and
use
the
cloth
to
piece
onto
the
bottoms
of
the
trousers
what
captain
joe
means
is
that
the
houses
in
the
village
are
all
built
beside
three
roads
running
longitudinally
there
is
the
main
road
and
the
upper
road
or
woodchuck
lane
just
as
you
prefer
and
the
lower
road
otherwise
known
as
bassett
the
upper
road
is
sometimes
called
the
depot
road
because
the
railroad
station
is
conveniently
located
thereon
convenient
for
the
railroad
that
is
the
station
being
a
full
mile
from
simmons
general
store
which
is
considered
the
center
of
the
town
the
upper
road
enters
the
main
road
at
the
corner
by
the
store
and
there
also
are
the
methodist
meetinghouse
and
the
schoolhouse
the
townhall
is
in
the
hollow
farther
on
then
comes
the
big
hill
whittaker
hill
and
from
the
top
of
this
hill
you
can
on
a
clear
day
see
for
miles
across
the
salt
marshes
and
over
the
bay
to
the
eastward
and
west
as
far
as
the
church
steeple
in
orham
if
there
happens
to
be
a
fog
with
a
strong
easterly
wind
you
can
not
see
the
marshes
or
the
bay
but
you
can
smell
them
wet
and
salty
and
sweet
it
is
a
smell
that
the
born
bayporter
never
forgets
but
carries
with
him
in
memory
wherever
he
goes
and
that
in
the
palmy
days
of
the
merchant
marine
was
likely
to
be
far
for
every
male
baby
in
the
village
was
born
with
web
feet
so
people
said
and
was
predestined
to
be
a
sailor
when
heman
atkins
came
back
from
the
south
seas
early
in
the
rich
as
dock
mud
though
still
a
young
man
he
promptly
tore
down
his
father
old
house
which
stood
on
the
crest
of
whittaker
hill
and
built
in
its
place
a
big
imposing
residence
it
was
by
far
the
finest
house
in
bayport
and
heman
made
it
finer
as
the
years
passed
there
were
imitation
brownstone
pillars
supporting
its
front
porch
iron
dogs
and
scroll
work
iron
benches
bordering
its
front
walk
and
a
pair
of
stone
urns
in
summer
filled
with
flowers
beside
its
big
iron
front
gate
heman
was
our
leading
citizen
our
representative
in
washington
and
the
town
philanthropist
he
gave
the
atkins
memorial
window
and
the
atkins
tower
clock
to
the
methodist
church
the
atkins
town
pump
also
his
gift
stood
before
the
townhall
the
atkins
portrait
in
the
bayport
ladies
library
was
much
admired
and
the
size
of
the
atkins
fortune
was
the
principal
subject
of
conversation
at
sewing
circle
at
the
table
of
the
perfect
boarding
house
around
the
stove
in
simmons
store
or
wherever
bayporters
were
used
to
gather
we
never
exactly
worshipped
heman
atkins
perhaps
but
we
figuratively
doffed
our
hats
when
his
name
was
mentioned
the
cy
whittaker
place
faced
the
atkins
estate
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
main
road
but
it
was
the
general
opinion
that
it
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
face
it
almost
everybody
called
it
the
cy
whittaker
place
although
some
of
the
younger
set
spoke
of
it
as
the
sea
sight
it
was
a
big
dwelling
and
brown
and
dilapidated
originally
it
had
enjoyed
the
dignified
seclusion
afforded
by
a
white
picket
fence
with
square
gateposts
and
the
path
to
its
front
door
had
been
guarded
by
rigid
lines
of
box
hedge
this
however
was
years
ago
before
the
second
captain
cy
whittaker
died
and
before
the
howes
family
turned
it
into
the
sea
sight
house
a
hotel
for
summer
boarders
the
howeses
improved
the
house
and
grounds
they
tore
down
the
picket
fence
uprooted
the
box
hedges
hung
a
sign
over
the
sacred
front
door
and
built
a
wide
veranda
under
the
parlor
windows
they
took
boarders
for
five
consecutive
summers
then
they
gave
up
the
unprofitable
undertaking
returned
to
concord
new
hampshire
their
native
city
and
left
the
cy
whittaker
place
to
bear
the
ravages
of
bayport
winters
and
bayport
small
boys
as
best
it
might
for
years
it
stood
empty
the
weeds
grew
high
about
its
foundations
the
sparrows
built
nests
behind
such
of
its
shutters
as
had
not
been
ripped
from
their
hinges
by
february
its
roof
grew
bald
in
spots
as
the
shingles
loosened
and
were
blown
away
the
swallows
flew
in
and
out
of
its
windowpanes
year
by
year
it
became
more
of
a
disgrace
in
the
eyes
of
bayport
neat
and
thrifty
inhabitants
for
neat
and
thrifty
we
are
if
we
do
say
it
the
selectmen
would
have
liked
to
tear
it
down
but
they
could
not
because
it
was
private
property
having
been
purchased
from
the
howes
heirs
by
the
third
cy
whittaker
captain
cy
only
son
who
ran
away
to
sea
when
he
was
sixteen
years
old
and
was
disinherited
and
cast
off
by
the
proud
old
skipper
in
consequence
each
march
asaph
tidditt
in
his
official
capacity
as
town
clerk
had
been
accustomed
to
receive
an
envelope
with
a
south
american
postmark
and
in
that
envelope
was
a
draft
on
a
boston
banking
house
for
the
sum
due
as
taxes
on
the
cy
whittaker
the
drafts
were
signed
cyrus
but
this
particular
year
the
year
in
which
this
chronicle
begins
no
draft
had
been
received
asaph
waited
a
few
weeks
and
then
wrote
to
the
address
indicated
by
the
postmark
his
letter
was
unanswered
the
taxes
were
due
in
march
and
it
was
now
may
tidditt
wrote
again
then
he
laid
the
case
before
the
board
of
selectmen
and
captain
eben
salters
chairman
of
that
august
body
also
wrote
but
even
captain
authoritative
demand
was
ignored
next
to
the
harbor
appropriation
the
question
of
what
should
be
done
about
the
cy
whittaker
place
filled
bayport
thoughts
that
spring
no
one
however
had
supposed
that
the
honorable
heman
might
wish
to
buy
it
bailey
bangs
surprise
was
excusable
what
in
the
world
repeated
bailey
does
heman
want
of
a
shebang
like
that
ai
he
got
enough
already
his
friend
shook
his
head
not
he
said
i
judge
it
this
way
bailey
heman
he
a
proud
man
well
ai
he
got
a
right
to
be
proud
broke
in
bangs
hastening
to
resent
any
criticism
of
the
popular
idol
you
and
me
be
proud
if
we
was
able
to
carry
as
much
sail
as
he
does
would
we
yes
i
guess
like
we
would
but
you
need
get
red
in
the
face
and
strain
your
biler
just
because
i
said
that
i
ai
finding
fault
with
heman
i
only
tellin
you
he
proud
as
i
said
and
his
wife
she
dead
this
four
year
what
are
you
resurrectin
her
for
land
you
peppery
as
a
west
injy
omelet
this
mornin
let
me
alone
till
i
finished
his
wife
when
she
was
alive
she
was
proud
too
and
his
daughter
alicia
she
eight
year
old
now
and
by
and
by
be
grown
up
into
a
young
woman
well
heman
is
and
i
likely
he
thinkin
of
the
days
when
there
be
young
rich
fellers
senators
and
and
well
counts
and
lords
maybe
down
here
courtin
her
by
that
time
the
whittaker
place
be
a
worse
disgrace
than
is
now
i
presume
he
do
want
those
swells
to
sit
on
his
front
piazza
and
see
the
crows
buildin
nests
in
the
ruins
acrost
the
road
so
crows
did
you
ever
see
a
crow
build
a
nest
in
a
house
i
never
did
oh
belay
crows
or
canary
birds
what
difference
does
it
make
somethin
nest
there
if
it
only
sophrony
hallett
hens
so
heman
he
writes
to
the
board
askin
if
the
taxes
is
paid
if
heard
any
reason
why
they
ai
paid
and
what
we
goin
to
do
about
it
if
there
a
sale
for
taxes
he
wants
to
be
fust
bidder
then
when
the
place
is
his
he
can
tear
down
or
rebuild
just
as
he
sees
fit
see
yes
i
see
well
i
feel
about
that
the
way
joe
dimick
felt
when
he
heard
the
doctor
had
told
elviry
pepper
she
must
stop
singin
in
the
choir
or
lose
her
voice
altogether
happens
be
an
improvement
says
joe
and
whatever
heman
does
help
the
whittaker
place
what
did
you
decide
at
the
meetin
nothin
we
ca
decide
yet
we
ai
sure
about
the
law
and
we

bailey
turned
and
looked
back
at
the
old
house
forlorn
amidst
its
huddle
of
blackberry
briers
and
weeds
and
with
the
ubiquitous
saplings
springing
up
in
clusters
everywhere
about
it
and
closing
in
on
its
defenseless
walls
like
squads
of
victorious
soldiery
making
the
final
charge
upon
a
conquered
fort
well
sighed
bangs
so
that
be
the
end
of
the
old
whittaker
place
hey
sho
things
change
in
a
feller
lifetime
do
they
you
and
me
can
remember
ase
when
cy
whittaker
was
one
of
the
biggest
men
we
had
in
this
town
so
was
his
dad
afore
him

cy
that
built
the
house

his
head

year

holy
terror

up

this
town
that
young

wa
into
fur
that
goes

in
too
bailey
we
was
all
holy
terrors
then
young
ones
nowadays
ai
got
the
spunk
we
used
to
his
friend
chuckled
that
so
he
declared
that
so
whit
was
a
boy
too
but
full
of
the
old
scratch
and
as
sot
in
his
ways
as
his
dad
and
if
cy
wa
sot
then
there
ai
no
sotness
go
to
college
and
be
a
parson
says
the
go
to
sea
and
be
a
sailor
same
as
you
done
says
whit
and
he
did
too
run
away
one
night
took
the
packet
to
boston
and
shipped
aboard
an
australian
clipper
cy
did
go
after
him
to
fetch
him

he
says
and
whit
did
he
wa
that
pretty
nigh
killed
the
old
lady
whit
ma
that
did
mused
asaph
she
died
a
little
spell
afterwards
and
the
old
man
pined
away
too
but
he
never
give
in
or
asked
the
boy
to
come
back
stubborn
as
all
to
the
end
he
was
and
willed

place

to
them
howes
folks
and
a
nice
mess
they
made
of
it
young
cy
he
young
cy
interrupted
bailey
we
always
callin
him
cy
and
yet
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
he
must
be
pretty
nigh
now
as
old
as
you
and
i
be
wonder
if
he
ever
come
back
you
bet
he
wo
was
the
oracular
reply
you
bet
he
wo
from
what
i
hear
he
got
to
be
a
sea
himself
and
settled
down
there
in
buenos
ayres
he
made
all
kinds
of
money
they
say
out
of
hides
and
such
what
he
ever
bought
his
dad
old
place
for
ca
see
he
never
come
back
to
these
common
latitudes
now
you
mark
my
word
on
that
it
was
a
prophecy
tidditt
was
accustomed
to
make
each
year
to
the
crowd
at
the
post
office
when
the
receipt
for
the
draft
for
taxes
caused
him
to
wax
reminiscent
the
younger
generation
here
in
bayport
regard
their
town
clerk
as
something
of
an
oracle
and
this
regard
has
made
asaph
a
trifle
vain
and
positive
bailey
chuckled
again
we
was
a
spunky
lot
in
the
old
days
wa
we
ase
he
said
spunk
was
kind
of
born
in
us
as
you
might
say
and
even
now
we
the
atkins
tower
clock
boomed
once
a
solemn
dignified
stroke
tidditt
and
his
companion
started
and
looked
at
each
other
godfrey
scissors
gasped
asaph
is
that
half
past
twelve
bangs
pulled
a
big
worn
silver
watch
from
his
pocket
and
glanced
at
the
dial
it
is
he
moaned
as
sure
you
born
it
is
we
kept
dinner
waitin
twenty
minutes
you
and
me
are
in
for
it
now
ase
tidditt
twenty
minutes
late
she
skin
us
tidditt
did
not
pause
to
answer
but
plunged
headlong
down
the
hill
at
a
gait
bailey
pounding
at
his
heels
for
born
they
were
a
nervous
and
apprehensive
pair
the
perfect
boarding
house
is
situated
a
quarter
of
a
mile
beyond
whittaker
hill
nearly
opposite
the
salters
homestead
the
sign
hung
on
the
pole
by
the
front
gate
reads
bayport
hotel
bailey
bangs
proprietor
but
no
one
except
the
stranger
in
bayport
accepts
that
sign
seriously
when
owing
to
an
unexpected
change
in
the
administration
at
washington
bangs
was
obliged
to
relinquish
his
position
as
our
village
postmaster
his
wife
came
to
the
rescue
with
the
proposal
that
they
open
a
boarding
house
you
find
to
do
quoted
keturah
at
meeting
it
then
with
all
your
might
that
a
good
hymn
tune
and
it
good
sense
besides
i
intend
to
make
it
my
life
work
to
run
just
as
complete
a
a
eatin
and
establishment
as
i
can
if
when
i
laid
to
rest
they
can
put
onto
my
gravestone
run
the
perfect
boardin
house
i
be
this
remark
and
subsequent
similar
declarations
were
widely
quoted
and
therefore
though
casual
visitors
may
refer
to
the
bayport
hotel
to
us
natives
the
bangs
residence
is
always
keturah
perfect
boarding
as
for
the
sign
affirmation
of
bangs
proprietorship
that
is
considered
the
cream
of
the
joke
the
idea
of
meek
little
bailey
posing
as
proprietor
of
anything
while
his
wife
is
on
deck
tickles
bayport
sense
of
humor
the
perspiring
delinquents
panted
into
the
yard
of
the
perfect
boarding
house
and
tremblingly
opened
the
door
leading
to
the
dining
room
dinner
was
well
under
way
and
bangs
enthroned
at
the
end
of
the
long
table
behind
the
teapot
was
waiting
to
receive
them
the
silence
was
appalling
sorry
to
be
a
little
behindhand
ketury
stammered
asaph
hurriedly
town
affairs
are
important
of
course
and
ca
be
neglected
i
yes
yes
that
so
ketury
cut
in
bangs
you
see
hum
yes
i
keturah
tone
was
several
degrees
below
freezing
hum
i
was
town
affairs
kept
you
too
hey
well
well
er
not
exactly
as
you
might
say
but
bailey
squeezed
himself
into
the
armchair
at
the
end
of
the
table
opposite
his
wife
the
end
which
with
sarcasm
not
the
less
keen
for
being
unintentional
was
called
the
not
exactly
town
affairs
that
kept
me
ketury
but
my
do
them
cod
cheeks
smell
good
you
always
could
cook
cod
cheeks
if
i
do
say
the
compliment
was
wasted
bangs
had
a
sermon
to
deliver
and
its
text
was
not
cod
bailey
bangs
she
began
when
i
was
brought
to
realize
that
my
husband
although
apparently
an
man
could
support
me
as
i
been
used
to
be
supported
and
when
i
was
forced
to
support
him
by
keepin
boarders
i
says
there
one
thing
that
my
house
shall
stand
for
it
punctual
promptness
at
meal
times
i
say
nothing
i
says
the
inconvenience
of
gettin
on
with
only
one
hired
help
when
we
ought
to
have
three
if
providence
in
its
unscrutable
wisdom
i
says
seen
fit
to
lay
this
burden
onto
me
the
burden
of
a
household
of
boarders
and
a
husband
whom
and
just
then
the
power
referred
to
by
bangs
intervened
to
spare
her
husband
the
remainder
of
the
preachment
from
the
driveway
of
the
yard
beside
the
windows
came
the
rattle
of
wheels
and
the
tramp
of
a
horse

matilda
tripp
who
sat
nearest
the
windows
on
that
side
rose
and
peered
out
it

somebody
inside
it
i
wonder
if

comin
transients
were
almost
unknown
quantities
at
the
bayport
hotel
in

consequently
all
the
boarders
and
the
landlady
herself
crowded
to
the
windows
the
depot
wagon
had
drawn
up
by
the
steps
and
gabe
lumley
the
driver
had
descended
from
his
seat
and
was
doing
his
best
to
open
the
door
of
the
ancient
vehicle

the
ropes

there

the
door
flew
back
with
a
bang
a
man
sprang
out
upon
the
lower
step
of
the
porch
the
eye
of
every
inmate
of
the
perfect
boarding
house
was
on
him

peered
from
the
kitchen
door
he
a
stranger
whispered
tripp
i
never

him
before
did
you
tidditt
the
town
clerk
did
not
answer
he
was
staring
at
the
depot
passenger
staring
with
a
face
the
interested
expression
of
which
was
changing
to
that
of
surprise
and
amazed
incredulity

turned
to

chapter
ii
the
wanderer
return
here
in
bayport
nowadays
the
collecting
of
antiques
is
a
favorite
amusement
of
our
summer
visitors
those
of
us
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
possess
a
set
of
nicked
blue
dishes
a
warming
pan
or
a
tall
clock
with
wooden
wheels
have
long
ago
parted
with
these
treasures
for
considerable
sums
oddly
enough
sylvanus
cahoon
has
profited
most
by
this
craze
sylvanus
used
to
be
judged
the
unluckiest
man
in
town
of
late
this
judgment
has
been
revised
it
was
sylvanus
who
confined
to
the
house
by
an
illness
brought
on
by
eating
too
much
sugar
cake
at
a
free
sociable
given
by
the
methodist
society
arose
in
the
night
and
drank
copiously
of
what
he
supposed
to
be
the
medicine
left
by
the
doctor
it
happened
to
be
poison
and
sylvanus
was
nearly
killed
by
the
dose
he
is
reported
as
having
admitted
that
he
did
mind
dyin
so
much
but
hated
to
die
such
a
dum
mean
while
convalescent
he
took
to
smoking
in
bed
and
was
burned
out
of
house
and
home
in
consequence
then
it
was
that
his
fellow
citizens
donated
for
the
furnishing
of
his
new
residence
all
the
bits
of
furniture
and
odds
and
ends
from
their
garrets
charity
observed
captain
josiah
dimick
at
the
time
begins
at
home
with
us
bayporters
and
it
generally
begins
up
attic
that
bein
nighest
to
later
sylvanus
sold
most
of
the
donations
as
antiques
and
made
money
enough
therefrom
to
buy
a
new
plush
parlor
set
miss
angeline
phinney
never
called
on
the
cahoons
after
that
without
making
her
appearance
at
the
front
door
i
get
some
good
out
of
that
plush
sofy
i
helped
to
pay
for
declared
angeline
if
it
only
to
wear
it
out
by
settin
on
there
are
two
antiques
in
bayport
which
have
not

for
one
is
gabe
lumley
depot
wagon
and
the
other
is
webster
the
horse
which
draws
it
both
are
very
ancient
sadly
in
need
of
upholstery
and
jerky
of
locomotion
gabe
was
as
usual
waiting
at
the
station
when
the
down
train
arrived
on
the
tuesday
or
wednesday
of
the
selectmen
meeting
the
train
was
due
according
to
the
at
eleven
this
and
the
signboard
of
the
bayport
hotel
are
the
only
bits
of
humorous
literature
peculiar
to
our
village
unless
we
add
the
political
editorials
of
the
bayport
breeze
so
at
eleven
lumley
was
serenely
dozing
on
the
baggage
truck
which
he
had
wheeled
to
the
sunny
side
of
the
platform
at
five
minutes
past
twelve
he
yawned
stretched
and
looked
at
his
watch
then
rolling
off
the
truck
he
strolled
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
spoke
authoritatively
to
hi
there
stand
still
commanded
lumley
standing
still
being
long
suit
the
order
was
obeyed
gabe
then
loafed
to
the
door
of
the
station
and
accosted
the
depot
master
who
was
nodding
in
his
chair
beside
the
telegraph
instrument
where

the
depot
master
rose
from
his
chair
a
yellow
dog
his
property
scrambled
from
beneath
it
and
rushing
out
of
the
door
and
to
the
farther
end
of
the
platform
barked
furiously
cephas
baker
who
lives
across
the
road
from
the
depot
slouched
down
to
his
front
gate
his
wife
opened
the
door
of
her
kitchen
and
stood
there
her
wet
arms
wrapped
in
her
apron
the
five
baker
children
tore
round
the
corner
of
the
house
over
the
back
fence
and
lined
up
whooping
joyously
on
the
platform
a
cloud
of
white
smoke
billowed
above
the
clump
of
cedars
at
the
bend
of
the
track
then
the
locomotive
rounded
the
curve
and
bore
down
upon
the
station
stand
still
i
tell

shouted
gabe
addressing
the
horse
webster
opened
one
eye
closed
it
and
relapsed
into
slumber
the
train
a
combination
baggage
car
and
smoker
two
freight
cars
and
a
passenger
coach
rolled
ponderously
alongside
the
platform
from
the
open
door
of
the
baggage
car
were
tossed
the
mail
sack
and
two
express
packages
the
conductor
stepped
from
the
passenger
coach
following
him
came
briskly
a
short
thickset
man
with
a
beard
and
hair
goin
down
to
the
village
mister
inquired
lumley
carriage
right
the
stranger
inspected
the
driver
of
the
depot
wagon
inspected
him
deliberately
from
top
to
toe
then
he
said
down
to
the
village
why
yes
i
would
wonder
say

lumley
ai

why
why
yes
i
be
how

a
quiet
chuckle
i
never
seen
you
either
but
i
seen
your
nose
i
know
a
lumley
nose
if
i
run
across
it
in
the
possessor
of
the
lumley
nose
rubbed
that
organ
in
a
bewildered
fashion
recovering
in
a
measure
he
laughed
rather
and
begged
to
know
if
the
trunk
then
being
unloaded
from
the
baggage
car
belonged
to
his
prospective
passenger
as
the
answer
was
an
affirmative
nod
he
secured
the
trunk
check
and
departed
still
rubbing
his
nose
when
he
returned
with
the
trunk
on
the
truck
he
found
the
stranger
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
standing
before
webster
and
gazing
at
that
animal
with
an
expression
of
acute
interest
is
this
your
horse
demanded
the
newcomer
pausing
before
the
final
word
of
his
question
it
so
to
be
replied
gabe
with
dignity
hum
does
he
work
nights
work
nights
no
course
he
do
oh
all
right
then
you
can
wake
him
up
with
a
clear
conscience
i
did
know
but
he
needed
the
sleep
what
his
record
record
yup
his
trottin
record
anybody
can
see
he
built
for
speed
narrow
in
the
beam
and
sharp
fore
and
aft
shall
i
get
aboard
the
barouche
the
depot
master
who
was
on
hand
to
help
with
the
trunk
grinned
broadly
lumley
sulkily
made
answer
that
his
passenger
might
get
aboard
if
he
wanted
to
apparently
he
wanted
to
for
he
sprang
into
the
depot
wagon
with
a
bounce
that
made
the
old
vehicle
rock
on
its
springs
jerushy
he
exclaimed
she
rolls
some
do
she
never
mind
my
ballast
keep
her
on
an
even
keel
trunk
made
fast
astern
all
right
say
you
might
furl
some
of
this
spare
canvas
so
i
can
take
an
observation
as
we
go
along
do
go
so
fast
that
the
scenery
gets
blurred
will
you

slowly

under
way
as
the
equipage

the
baker
homestead
the
whole
family
was
clustered
about
the
gate
staring
at
the
occupant
of
the
wagon
the
stare
was
returned

in
there
demanded
the
stranger

that

a
new
house
who
built
that
the
new
house
was
fifteen
years
old
but
gabe
gave
the
name
of
its
builder
then
thinking
that
the
catechising
had
been
altogether
too
he
ventured
an
observation
of
his
own
this

a
pretty
good
cigar

said

my
life
in
this
dead
alive
hole
i
wanted
to
go
to
boston
and
clerk
in
a
store
but
the
old
man
put
his
foot
down
and
here
i
stuck
ever
sence
git
up
what
the
matter
with
you
the
passenger
smiled
but
there
was
a
dreamy
look
in
his
gray
eyes
do
find
fault
son
he
said
there
worse
places
in
the
world
than
old
bayport
and
worse
judgment
than
mindin
your
dad
do
forget
that
or
you
may
be
sorry
for
it
some
he
sniffed
eagerly
ah
he
exclaimed
just
smell
that
will
you
ai
that
fine
humph
that
the
flats
you
can
smell
any
time
when
the
tide
out

the
wind
right

see
the
tide
goes
out
pretty
fur
here
and
do

waitin
thirty
odd
year
for
that
smell
and
here

and
let
me
fill
up
on
it
just
blow
that
that
snowstorm
of
yours
the
other
way
for
a
spell
wo
you
the
request
to
be
driven
slow
was
so
superfluous
that
lumley
paid
no
attention
to
it
he
puffed
industriously
at
the
snowflake
and
watched
his
companion
who
leaning
forward
on
the
seat
was
gazing
out
at
the
town
and
the
bay
beyond
it
the
depot
hill
is
not
as
high
as
whittaker
hill
but
the
view
is
almost
as
extensive
excuse
me
mister
observed
gabe
after
an
interval
but
you
said
where
you
the
passenger
came
out
of
his
day
dream
with
a
start
why
that
right
he
exclaimed
so
i
have
well
now
where
would
you
go
if
you
was
me
is
there
a
hotel
or
tavern
or
somethin
yup
there
the
bayport
hotel
exactly
a
hotel
neither
we
call
it
the
perfect
boardin
house
here
you
see
he
proceeded
to
tell
the
story
of
the
perfect
boarding
his
listener
seemed
greatly
interested
and
although
he
laughed
did
not
interrupt
until
the
tale
was
ended
so
he
said
chuckling
bailey
bangs
hey
stub
bangs
well
well
and
he
married
ketury
payson
how
in
time
did
he
ever
find
spunk
enough
to
propose
and
ketury
runs
the
perfect
boardin
house
well
that
ought
to
be
job
enough
for
one
woman
she
runs
bailey
too
on
the
side
i
you
bet
you
he
do
dast
to
say
to
a
chicken
when
she
i
say
mister
i
do
know
i
know
your
name
do
i
i
judge
been
here
afore
so
yes
i
been
here
before
whose
is
that
big
place
up
there
across
our
bows
the
one
with
the
cupola
on
the
main
truck
that
sir
said
lumley
oratorically
belongs
to
the
honorable
heman
atkins
and
it
probably
the
finest
in
this
county
heman
is
our
representative
in
and
did
you
say
anything
the
passenger
had
said
something
but
he
did
not
repeat
it
he
was
leaning
from
the
carriage
and
gazing
steadily
up
the
slope
ahead
and
his
gaze
strange
to
say
was
not
directed
at
the
imposing
atkins
estate
but
at
its
opposite
neighbor
the
old
cy
whittaker
slowly
laboriously
webster
mounted
the
hill
at
the
crest
he
would
have
paused
to
take
breath
but
the
driver
would
not
let
him
git
along
you
he
commanded
flapping
the
reins
and
then
lumley
suffered
the
shock
of
a
surprise
the
hitherto
cool
and
occupant
of
the
rear
seat
seemed
very
much
excited
his
big
red
hand
clasped
lumley
over
the
reins
and
was
brought
to
an
abrupt
standstill
heave
to
he
ordered
sharply
and
the
tone
was
that
of
one
who
has
given
many
orders
and
expects
them
to
be
obeyed
belay
whoa
there
great
land
of
love
look
at
that
look
at
it
who
did
that
the
mate
to
the
big
red
hand
pointed
to
the
front
door
of
the
whittaker
place
gabe
was
alarmed
done
what
done
which
he
gasped
what
you
talkin
about
there
nobody
lives
in
there
that
house
has
been
empty
for
where
the
front
fence
demanded
the
excited
passenger
become
of
the
hedge
and
who
put
up
that
that
darned
piazza
the
piazza
had
been
where
it
now
was
almost
since
lumley
could
remember
he
hastened
to
reply
that
he
did
know
he
was
sure
he
presumed
likely
was
them
new
hampshire
howeses
when
they
ran
a
summer
boarding
house
the
stranger
drew
a
long
breath
well
of
all
the
he
began
then
he
choked
hesitated
and
ordered
his
driver
to
heave
ahead
and
run
alongside
the
hotel
as
quick
as
the
almighty
would
let
him
gabe
hastened
to
obey
he
was
now
absolutely
certain
that
his
companion
was
an
escaped
lunatic
and
the
sooner
another
keeper
was
appointed
the
better
the
remainder
of
the
trip
was
made
in
silence
bangs
opened
the
door
of
the
perfect
boarding
house
and
stood
majestically
waiting
to
receive
the
prospective
guest
over
her
shoulders
peered
the
faces
of
the
boarders
good
afternoon
began
the
landlady
i
presume
likely
you
would
like
to
she
was
interrupted
the
newcomer
turned
toward
her
and
extended
his
hand
hello

said

and
his
chum
the
town
clerk
had
emerged
from
the
doorway
their
mouths
and
eyes
were
wide
open
and
they
seemed
to
be
suffering
from
a
sort
of
paralysis
well
what
the
matter
with
you
demanded
the
arrival
ai
too
stuck
up
to
shake
hands
after
all
these
years

house
it
starts

down
mornin
chapter
iii
fixin
over
miss
angeline
phinney
made
no
less
than
nine
calls
that
afternoon
before
bedtime
it
was
known
from
the
last
house
in
woodchuck
lane
to
the
fish
shanties
at
west
bayport
that
young
cy
whittaker
had
come
back
that
he
had
come
back
for
good
that
he
was
staying
temporarily
at
the
perfect
boarding
house
that
he
was
awful
well
off
having
made
lots
of
money
down
in
south
america
that
he
intended
to
fix
over
the
whittaker
place
and
that
it
was
to
be
fixed
over
not
in
a
modern
manner
with
plush
parlor
sets
a
la
sylvanus
cahoon
nor
with
onyx
tables
and
blue
and
gold
chairs
like
those
adorning
the
atkins
mansion
it
was
to
be
as
near
as
possible
a
reproduction
of
what
it
had
been
in
the
time
of
the
late
cy
young
cy
father
think
he
out
of
his
head
declared
miss
phinney
in
confidence
to
each
of
the
nine
females
whom
she
favored
with
her
calls
not
crazy

slips

for
you
it
be
a
pleasure
he
says
now
ai
that
crazy
talk
for
a
grown
man
miss
phinney
was
not
the
only
one
in
our
village
to
question
captain
cy
whittaker
sanity
during
the
next
few
months
the
majority
of
our
people
did
understand
him
at
all
he
was
generally
liked
for
although
he
had
money
he
did
not
put
on
airs
but
he
had
his
own
way
of
doing
things
and
they
were
not
bayport
ways
true
to
his
promise
he
had
a
squad
of
carpenters
busy
on
the
day
following
his
arrival
tearing
down
the
loathed
piazza
these
carpenters
and
more
were
kept
busy
throughout
that
entire
spring
and
well
into
the
summer
then
came
painters
and
gardeners
the
piazza
disappeared
a
new
picket
fence
exactly
like
the
old
one
torn
down
by
the
howeses
was
erected
new
shutters
were
hung
new
windowpanes
were
set
the
roof
was
newly
shingled
captain
cy
senior
had
in
his
day
cherished
a
new
england
fondness
for
white
and
green
paint
therefore
the
new
fence
was
white
and
the
house
was
white
and
the
blinds
a
brilliant
green
rows
of
box
hedge
the
plants
brought
from
boston
were
set
out
on
each
side
of
the
front
walk
the
howes
bell
a
clamorous
gong
was
removed
and
a
glass
knob
attached
to
a
spring
bell
of
the
jingle
variety
took
its
place
an
flower
garden
cy
mother
had
loved
posies
was
laid
out
on
the
west
lawn
beyond
the
pear
trees
all
these
changes
the
captain
superintended
when
they
were
complete
he
turned
his
attention
to
interior
decoration
and
now
captain
cy
proceeded
to
literally
astonish
the
natives
among
the
howes
improvements
were
gilt
wall
papers
and
modern
furniture
for
the
lower
floor
of
the
house
the
furniture
they
had
taken
with
them
the
wall
paper
had
perforce
been
left
behind
and
the
captain
had
every
scrap
of
that
paper
stripped
from
the
walls
and
the
latter
with
quaint
ugly
patterns
stripes
and
roses
and
flowered
sprays
with
impossible
birds
flitting
among
them
the
bassett
decorators
has
pasted
the
gilt
improvement
over
the
old
whittaker
paper
and
it
was
the
whittaker
paper
that
the
captain
did
his
best
to
match
sending
samples
here
there
and
everywhere
in
the
effort
then
upon
the
walls
he
hung
pictures
such
as
bayport
dwellers
had
long
ago
relegated
to
their
attics
pictures
like
from
shore
to
shore
christian
viewing
the
city
beautiful
and
signing
the
to
these
he
added
bringing
them
from
the
crowded
garret
of
the
homestead
oil
paintings
of
ships
commanded
by
his
father
and
grandfather
and
family
portraits
executed
which
is
a
peculiarly
fitting
word
by
deceased
local
artists
in
oil
and
crayon
he
boarded
up
the
fireplace
in
the
sitting
room
and
installed
a
stove
resurrected
from
the
tinsmith
barn
he
purchased
a
full
haircloth
set
of
parlor
furniture
from
old
penniman
who
never
had
been
known
to
sell
any
of
her
hoarded
belongings
before
even
to
the
antiquers
and
would
have
done
so
now
had
it
not
been
that
the
captain
offer
was
too
princely
to
be
real
and
the
old
lady
feared
she
might
be
dreaming
and
would
wake
up
before
she
received
the
money
and
from
trumet
to
ostable
he
journeyed
buying
a
chair
here
and
a
table
there
braided
rag
mats
from
this
one
and
corded
bedsteads
and
rising
sun
quilts
from
that
at
least
half
of
bayport
believed
with
gabe
lumley
and
miss
phinney
that
if
captain
cy
had
not
escaped
from
a
home
for
the
insane
he
was
a
likely
candidate
for
such
an
institution
at
the
table
of
the
perfect
boarding
house
the
captain
was
not
inclined
to
be
communicative
regarding
his
reasons
and
his
intentions
he
was
a
prime
favorite
there
praising
keturah
cooking
joking
with
angeline
concerning
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
her
giddy
manner
of
dressing
and
wearing
side
curls
and
telling
yarns
of
south
american
dress
and
behavior
which
would
probably
have
shocked
tripp
she
having
recently
left
the
methodist
church
to
join
the
because
the
sunday
services
of
the
former
were
with
the
organ
and
a
paid
choir
altogether
too
if
they
had
not
been
so
interesting
and
if
captain
cy
had
not
always
concluded
them
with
the
observation
but
there
you
ca
expect
nothin
more
from
ignorant
critters
denied
the
privileges
of
congregational
singin
and
experience
meetin
hey
matilda
tripp
would
sigh
and
admit
that
she
supposed
not
only
i
do
wish
daniels
our
minister
might
have
a
chance
to
preach
over
poor
things
so
do
i
with
a
covert
wink
at
bangs
who
was
a
stanch
adherent
of
the
regular
faith
south
america
be
just
the
place
for
him
that
so
keturah
he
evaded
all
personal
questions
put
to
him
by
the
boarders
explaining
that
he
was
renovating
the
old
place
just
for
fun
he
always
had
had
a
gang
of
men
working
for
him
and
it
seemed
natural
somehow
but
to
the
friends
of
his
boyhood
asaph
tidditt
and
bailey
bangs
he
told
the
real
truth
i
swan
to
man
exclaimed
bailey
almost
tearfully
as
the
trio
wandered
through
the
rooms
of
the
cy
whittaker
place
dodging
paper
hangers
and
plasterers
i
swan
to
man
whit
if
it
do
almost
seem
as
though
i
was
a
boy
again
why
it
your
dad
house
come
back
alive
it
is
so
look
at
this
settin
room
seem
if
i
could
see
him
now
by
that
ere
stove
and
whittaker
your
ma
over
there
and
old
cy
your
granddad
snoozin
in
that
big
armchair
why

the
very
image
of
the
chair
he
always
set
in
captain
cy
laughed
aloud
it
more
n
that
bailey
he
said
it
the
chair
was
up
attic
all
busted
and
crippled
but
i
had
it
made
over
like
new
and
granddad
picture
lookin
just
as
i
remember
him
only
he
wa
quite
so
much
of
a
frozen
wax
image
as
he
painted
there
i
goin
to
hang
it
where
it
always
hung
over
the
mantelpiece
next
to
the
glass
great
land
of
love
boys
he
went
on
you
fellers
do
know
what
this
means
to
me
many
and
many
the
time
i
had
this
old
house
and
this
old
room
in
my
mind
i
seen
aboard
ship
in
a
howlin
gale
off
the
horn
i
seen
down
in
surinam
of
a
hot
night
when
there
wa
a
breath
scurcely
and
the
caribs
went
around
dressed
in
a
handkerchief
and
a
paper
cigar
and
it
made
you
wish
you
could
seen
but
there
every
time
i
seen
i
swore
that
some
day
i
come
back
and
live
and
now
by
the
big
dipper
here
i
am
oh
i
tell
you
chummies
you
want
to
be
fired
out
of
a
home
and
out
of
a
town
to
appreciate
not
that
i
blame
the
old
man
he
and
i
was
too
much
alike
to
cruise
in
company
but
bayport
i
was
born
in
and
in
the
bayport
graveyard
they
can
plant
me
when
i
ready
for
the
scrap
heap
it
in
the
blood
and
why
see
here
do
i
talk
like
a
bayporter
you
sartin
do
replied
asaph
emphatically
a
body
think
you
been
diggin
clams
and
pickin
cranberries
in
bassett
holler
all
your
life
long
to
hear
you
bet
well
that
pride
that
what
that
is
i
prided
myself
on
hangin
to
the
bayport
twang
through
thick
and
thin
among
all
the
spanish
and
de
dioses
it
did
me
good
to
come
out
with
a
good
old
yankee
once
in
a
while
kept
me
feelin
like
a
white
man
oh
i
a
whittaker
know
it
and
i
got
all
the
whittaker
i
guess
and
because
the
old
man
bless
his
heart
i
say
now
told
me
i
should
be
a
whittaker
no
more
nor
live
like
a
whittaker
i
simply
swore
up
and
down
i
would
be
one
and
come
back
here
when
i
made
my
pile
to
heave
anchor
and
stay
one
till
i
die
maybe
that
foolishness
but
it
he
puffed
vigorously
at
the
pipe
which
had
taken
the
place
of
the
snowflake
cigar
and
added
take
this
old
settin
room
why
here
it
is
see
here
dad
in
his
chair
and
ma
in
hers
and
if
you
go
back
far
enough
granddad
in
his
just
as
you
say
bailey
and
here
me
a
little
shaver
squattin
on
the
floor
by
the
stove
lookin
at
the
pictures
in
a
heap
of
lady
book
and
says
dad
he
says
he
used
to
call
me
in
those
days
says
dad
down
cellar
and
fetch
me
up
a
pitcher
of
cider
that
a
good
feller
yes
yes
that
this
room
as
i
seen
it
in
my
mind
ever
since
i
tiptoed
through
it
the
night
i
run
away
with
my
duds
in
a
bundle
under
my
arm
do
you
wonder
i
was
fightin
mad
when
i
saw
what
that
howes
tribe
had
done
to
it
superintending
the
making
over
of
the
old
home
occupied
most
of
captain
cy
daylight
time
that
summer
his
evenings
were
spent
at
store
we
have
no
clubs
in
bayport
strictly
speaking
for
the
sewing
circle
and
the
shakespeare
reading
society
are
exclusively
feminine
in
membership
therefore
simmons
store
is
the
gathering
place
of
those
males
who
are
bachelors
or
widowers
or
who
are
sufficiently
free
from
petticoat
government
to
risk
an
occasional
evening
out
asaph
tidditt
was
a
regular
sojourner
at
the
store
bailey
bangs
happening
in
to
purchase
fifty
cents
worth
of
sugar
or
to
have
the
molasses
jug
filled
lingered
occasionally
but
not
often
captain
cy
explained
absence
in
characteristic
fashion
variety
observed
the
captain
is
the
spice
of
life
bailey
gets
talk
enough
to
home
what
the
use
of
his
comin
up
here
to
get
more
oh
i
do
know
said
josiah
dimick
with
a
grin
we
let
him
do
some
of
the
talkin
himself
up
here
down
at
the
boardin
house
keturah
and
angie
phinney
do
it
yes
still
if
a
feller
was
condemned
to
live
over
a
biler
factory
he
would
hanker
to
get
a
job
in
it
would
he
when
bailey
was
a
delegate
to
the
methodist
conference
up
in
boston
him
and
a
crowd
visited
the
deef
and
dumb
asylum
when
was
time
to
go
he
was
missin
and
they
found
him
in
the
female
ward
lookin
at
the
inmates
said
that
the
sight
of
all
them
women
every
one
of
not
able
to
say
a
word
was
the
most
wonderful
thing
ever
he
laid
eyes
on
said
it
made
him
feel
kind
of
reverent
and
holy
almost
as
if
he
was
in
paradise
so
ase
tidditt
says
anyway
it
his
nuther
cy
whittaker
declared
the
indignant
asaph
if
you
expect
i
goin
to
father
all
your
lies
you
the
crowd
at
simmons
discuss
politics
as
a
general
thing
state
and
national
politics
in
their
seasons
but
county
politics
and
local
affairs
always
the
question
in
bayport
that
summer
aside
from
that
of
the
harbor
appropriation
was
who
should
be
hired
as
downstairs
teacher
our
schoolhouse
is
a
building
with
a
schoolroom
on
each
floor
the
lower
room
where
the
little
tots
begin
with
their
c
a
t
cat
and
progress
until
they
have
mastered
the
fourth
reader
is
called
upstairs
is
of
course
the
second
story
where
the
older
children
are
taught
to
handle
some
of
the
big
boys
upstairs
is
a
task
for
a
healthy
man
and
such
a
one
usually
fills
the
position
there
downstairs
being
in
theory
at
least
less
strenuous
is
presided
over
by
a
woman
miss
seabury
who
had
been
downstairs
teacher
for
one
lively
term
had
resigned
that
spring
in
tears
and
humiliation
her
scholars
had
enjoyed
themselves
and
would
have
liked
her
to
continue
but
the
committee
and
the
townspeople
thought
otherwise
there
was
a
general
feeling
that
enjoyment
was
not
the
whole
aim
of
education
betty
said
captain
dimick
referring
to
his
small
granddaughter
has
done
fust
rate
so
fur
marksmanship
and
lung
trainin
goes
i
she
can
hit
a
nail
head
ten
foot
off
with
a
spitball
three
times
out
of
four
and
she
can
whisper
loud
enough
to
be
understood
in
jericho
but
not
wishing
to
be
unreasonable
still
i
should
like
to
have
her
spell
without
an
i
always
been
used
to
seein
it
spelled
that
way
and
well
i
kind
of
there
was
a
difference
of
opinion
concerning
miss
seabury
successor
a
portion
of
the
townspeople
were
for
hiring
a
graduate
of
the
state
normal
school
a
young
woman
with
modern
training
others
remembering
that
miss
seabury
had
graduated
from
that
school
were
for
proved
ability
and
less
methods
these
latter
had
selected
a
candidate
in
the
person
of
a
miss
phoebe
dawes
a
resident
of
wellmouth
and
teacher
of
the
wellmouth
downstairs
for
some
years
the
arguments
at
simmons
were
hot
ones
what
the
use
of
hirin
somebody
from
right
next
door
to
us
as
you
might
say
demanded
alpheus
smalley
clerk
at
the
store
do
we
want
our
teachin
to
be
abreast
of
the
times
and
is
wellmouth
abreast
of
anything
it
abreast
of
the
bay
that
about
all
i
will
give
in
replied
tidditt
but
the
way
i
look
at
it
we
need
discipline
more
anything
else
and
phoebe
dawes
has
had
the
best
discipline
in
her
school
been
known
in
these
latitudes
order
why
say
eben
salters
told
me
that
when
he
visited
her
room
over
there
was
so
still
that
he
dast
to
rub
one
shoe
against
it
sounded
up
so
he
had
to
set
still
and
bear
his
chilblains
best
he
could
and
popular
why
when
she
hinted
that
she
might
leave
in
may
her
scholars
more
of
bust
out
cryin
now
you
hear
me
i
it
seems
to
me
put
in
thaddeus
simpson
who
ran
the
barber
shop
and
was
something
of
a
politician
it
seems
to
me
fellers
that
better
wait
and
hear
what
atkins
has
to
say
in
this
matter
i
guess
that
what
the
committee
do
anyhow
we
would
want
to
go
contrary
to
heman
none
of
us
hey
tad
simpson
was
known
to
be
deep
in
congressman
atkins
confidence
the
mention
of
the
great
man
name
was
received
with
reverence
and
nods
of
approval
that
right
we
must
do
nothin
to
displease
heman
was
the
general
opinion
captain
cy
did
not
join
the
chorus
he
refilled
his
pipe
and
crossed
his
legs
humph
he
grunted
heman
atkins
seems
to
be
give
me
a
match
ase
wo
you
thanks
i
understand
there
a
special
prayer
meetin
at
the
church
night
alpheus
what
it
for
for
smalley
seemed
surprised
it
to
pray
for
rain
what
you
know
it
as
well
i
do
ai
everybody
garden
dryin
up
and
the
ponds
so
low
that
we
sha
be
able
to
get
water
for
the
cranberry
ditches
pretty
soon
there
need
to
pray
i
should
think
humph
seems
a
roundabout
way
of
gettin
a
thing
do
it
why
you
telegraph
to
heman
and
ask
him
to
fix
it
for
you
save
this
remark
was
received
in
horrified
silence
tad
simpson
was
the
first
to
recover
he
said
you
ai
met
atkins
yet
when
you
do
feel
same
as
the
rest
of
us
he
comin
home
next
week
then
a
part
at
least
of
simpson
prophecy
proved
true
the
honorable
atkins
did
come
to
bayport
the
following
week
accompanied
by
his
little
daughter
alicia
the
housekeeper
and
the
atkins
servants
the
honorable
and
his
daughter
had
been
since
the
adjournment
of
congress
on
a
pleasure
trip
to
the
yosemite
and
yellowstone
park
and
now
they
were
to
remain
in
the
mansion
on
the
hill
for
some
time
the
big
house
was
opened
the
stone
urns
burst
into
refulgent
bloom
the
iron
dogs
were
refreshed
with
a
coat
of
black
paint
and
the
big
iron
gate
was
swung
wide
bayport
sat
up
and
took
notice
angeline
phinney
was
in
her
glory
the
meeting
between
captain
cy
and
atkins
took
place
the
morning
after
the
latter
return
the
captain
and
his
two
chums
had
been
inspecting
the
progress
made
by
the
carpenters
and
were
leaning
over
the
new
fence
then
just
erected
but
not
yet
painted
down
the
gravel
walk
of
the
mansion
across
the
road
came
strolling
its
owner
benignant
godfrey
exclaimed
asaph
there
heman
see
him
whit
yup
i
see
him
seems
to
be
headin
this
i
i
do
believe
he

real
everyday

best
i
can
without
stimulants
as
the
doctor
says
if
you
hear
my
knees
rattle
just
nudge
me
will
you
bailey
tidditt
removed
his
hat
bailey
touched
his
captain
cy
looked
provokingly
indifferent
he
even
whistled
good
mornin
atkins
hailed
the
town
clerk
raising
his
voice
because
of
the
whistle
i
proud
to
see
you
back
among
us
sir
hope
you
and
alicia
had
a
nice
time
out
west
how
is
she
pretty
smart
atkins
smiled
a
bland
congressional
smile
he
approached
the
group
by
the
fence
and
extended
his
hand
ah
asaph
he
said
it
is
you
then
i
thought
so
and
bailey
too
it
is
certainly
delightful
to
see
you
both
again
yes
my
daughter
is
well
i
thank
you
she
like
her
father
is
glad
to
be
back
in
the
old
home
nest
after
the
round
of
hotel
life
and
gayety
which
we
have
er
recently
undergone
mr
atkins
said
bailey
glancing
nervously
at
captain
cy
who
had
stopped
whistling
and
was
regarding
the
atkins
hat
and
whiskers
with
an
interested
air
i
want
to
make
you
acquainted
with
your
new
neighbor
you
used
to
know
him
when
you
was
a
boy
but
but
er
atkins
this
is
captain
cyrus
whittaker
cy
this
is
congressman
atkins
you
heard
us
speak
of
the
great
man
started
is
it
possible
he
exclaimed
is
it
possible
that
this
is
really
my
old
playmate
cyrus
whittaker
yup
replied
the
captain
calmly
how
are
you
heman
you
used
to
be
ai
you
must
agree
with
bailey
and
asaph
were
scandalized
atkins
himself
seemed
a
trifle
taken
aback
comments
on
his
personal
appearance
were
not
usual
in
bayport
but
he
rallied
bravely
well
well
he
cried
cyrus
i
am
delighted
to
welcome
you
back
among
us
i
should
scarcely
have
known
you
you
are
older
yes
much
well
forty
year
more
or
less
added
to
what
you
started
with
is
apt
to
make
a
feller
some
older
do
need
any
normal
school
graduate
to
do
that
sum
for
us
i
within
seven
or
eight
year
of
bein
as
old
as
you
are
heman
and
that
too
antique
to
be
sold
for
atkins
changed
the
subject
i
had
heard
of
your
return
cyrus
he
said
it
gave
me
much
pleasure
to
learn
that
you
were
rebuilding
and
er
renovating
the
er
the
ancestral
er
the
old
home
nest
yup
i
puttin
back
a
few
feathers
old
birds
like
to
roost
you
got
a
fairly
roomy
coop
hum
is
it
er
i
should
suppose
you
would
find
it
rather
expensive
can
you
do
you
yes
i
can
afford
it
thank
you
maybe
there
be
enough
left
in
the
stockin
to
buy
a
few
knickknacks
for
the
yard
you
ca
the
captain
glanced
at
the
iron
dogs
guarding
the
atkins
gate
his
tone
was
rather
sharp
yes
yes
certainly
certainly
of
course
it
gives
me
much
pleasure
to
have
you
as
a
neighbor
i
have
always
felt
a
fondness
for
the
old
place
even
when
you
allowed
it
even
when
it
was
most
er
run
down
if
excuse
the
term
i
always
felt
a
liking
for
it
and
yes
was
the
significant
interruption
i
judged
you
must
have
from
what
i
this
was
steering
dangerously
close
to
the
selectmen
and
the
contemplated
sale
for
the
town
clerk
broke
in
nervously
mr
atkins
he
said
there
been
talk
in
town
about
who
to
be
teacher
downstairs
this
comin
year
we
sort
of
chawed
it
over
among
us
but
naturally
we
wanted
your
opinion
what
do
you
think
i
kind
of
leanin
toward
the
dawes
woman
the
congressman
cleared
his
throat
far
be
it
from
me
he
said
to
speak
except
as
a
mere
member
of
our
little
community
an
ordinary
member
but
as
such
a
member
with
the
welfare
of
my
birthplace
very
near
and
dear
to
me
i
confess
that
i
am
inclined
to
favor
a
modern
teacher
one
educated
and
trained
in
the
institution
provided
for
the
purpose
by
our
great
commonwealth
the
dawes
er
person
is
undoubtedly
worthy
and
capable
in
her
way
but
well
er
we
know
that
wellmouth
is
not
the
reference
to
our
great
commonwealth
had
been
given
in
the
voice
and
the
manner
wont
to
thrill
us
at
our
celebrations
and
october
two
of
his
hearers
at
least
were
visibly
impressed
asaph
looked
somewhat
crestfallen
but
he
surrendered
gracefully
to
superior
wisdom
that
so
he
said
that
so
ai
it
cy
i
had
thought
of
what
so
asked
the
captain
why
why
that
wellmouth
ai
no
doubt
of
it
they
twenty
miles
yes
well
i
glad
to
hear
you
put
it
so
conclusive
atkins
i
can
see
now
that
phoebe
would
do
hum
atkins
buttoned
the
frock
coat
and
turned
to
go
good
day
gentlemen
he
said
cyrus
permit
me
once
more
to
welcome
you
heartily
to
our
village
we
my
daughter
and
myself
will
probably
remain
at
home
until
the

but
one
myrick

murmured
the
captain
and
was
silent
for
some
minutes
the
school
committee
met
on
the
following
wednesday
evening
on
thursday
morning
a
startling
rumor
spread
throughout
bayport
phoebe
dawes
had
been
called
by
a
vote
of
two
to
one
to
teach
the
downstairs
school
asaph
aghast
rushed
out
of
simmons
store
and
up
to
the
hill
to
the
cy
whittaker
place
he
found
captain
cy
in
the
front
yard
myrick
school
committeeman
and
house
painter
was
with
him
hello
ase
hailed
the
captain
what
the
matter
has
the
tide
come
in
this
mornin
asaph
somewhat
embarrassed
by
the
presence
of
myrick
hesitated
over
his
news
lemuel
came
to
his
rescue
ase
has
just
heard
that
we
called
phoebe
he
said
what
of
it
i
voted
for
her
and
i
ai
ashamed
of
but
but
atkins
he
well
heman
ai
on
the
committee

he
i

way

he
added
going

spring
yes
whittaker
i
think
three
coats
of
white
do
on
the
sides
lem
goin
to
do
my
paintin
jobs
explained
captain
cy
his
price
was
a
little
higher
than
some
of
the
other
fellers
but
i
like
his
tidditt
pondered
deeply
until
dinner
time
then
he
cornered
the
captain
behind
the
bangs
barn
and
spoke
with
conviction
whit
he
said
you
the
one
responsible
for
the
committee
phoebe
dawes
you
offered
lem
the
paintin
job
if
he
vote
for
her
what
did
you
do
it
for
you
do
know
her
do
you
never
set
eyes
on
her
in
my
then
then
you
heard
heman
say
he
wanted
the
other
one
what
made
you
do
it
captain
cy
grinned
ase
he
said
i
always
been
a
great
hand
for
tryin
experiments
had
one
of
my
cooks
aboard
put
raisins
in
the
flapjacks
once
just
to
see
what
they
tasted
like
i
judged
heman
had
had
his
own
way
in
this
town
for
thirty
odd
year
i
kind
of
wanted
to
see
what
would
happen
if
he
did
have
chapter
iv
bailey
bangs
experiment
lemuel
myrick
painting
jobs
have
the
quality
so
prized
by
our
village
small
boys
in
the
species
of
candy
called
jaw
breakers
namely
that
of
lasting
but
even
lem
must
finish
sometime
or
other
and
late
in
july
the
cy
whittaker
place
was
ready
for
occupancy
the
pictures
were
in
their
places
on
the
walls
the
furniture
filled
the
rooms
there
was
even
a
pile
of
old
magazines
back
numbers
of
godey
lady
book
on
the
shelf
in
the
sitting
room
closet
then
when
captain
cy
had
notified
bangs
that
the
perfect
boarding
house
would
shelter
him
no
longer
than
the
coming
week
a
new
problem
arose
whit
said
asaph
earnestly
you
sartin
made
the
place
rise
up
out
of
its
tomb
you
have
so
it
a
miracle
pretty
nigh
and
i
it
must
have
cost
a
heap
but
you
done
it
all
but
the
old
folks
themselves
you
ca
raise
them
up
cy
money
wo
do
that
and
you
ca
live
in
this
great
house
all
alone
who
goin
to
cook
for
you
and
sweep
and
dust
and
swab
decks
and
one
thing
you
have
to
have
a
housekeeper
as
i
told
you
a
spell
ago
have
you
done
any
thinkin
about
that
and
the
captain
taking
his
pipe
from
his
lips
stared
blankly
at
his
friend
and
answered
by
the
big
dipper
ase
i
ai
i
remember
we
did
mention
it
but
been
so
busy
gettin
this
craft
off
the
ways
that
i
forgot
all
about
the
discussion
which
followed
tidditt
reminder
was
long
and
serious
asaph
and
bailey
bangs
racked
their
brains
and
offered
numerous
suggestions
but
the
majority
of
these
were
not
favorably
received
there
matildy
tripp
said
bailey
she
like
the
job
i
sartin
she
a
widow
too
and
she
had
experience
keepin
house
along
of
tobias
him
that
was
her
husband
but
if
you
do
hire
her
do
let
ketury
know
i
hinted
at
it
we
goin
to
lose
one
boarder
when
you
quit
and
that
too
many
to
the
old
lady
way
of
you
can
keep
matildy
for
all
me
replied
the
captain
decidedly
religion
all
right
for
those
that
have
that
kind
of
appetite
but
havin
it
passed
to
me
three
times
a
day
same
as
had
it
at
your
house
is
enough
i
do
hanker
to
have
it
warmed
over
between
meals
if
i
shipped
matildy
aboard
here
she
and
the
reverend
daniels
would
stand
over
me
watch
and
watch
till
i
was
converted
or
crazy
one
or
the
well
there
angie
she
angie
sniffed
tidditt
stop
your
jokin
bailey
this
is
a
serious
i
wa
jokin
what
there
there
boys
interrupted
the
captain
do
fight
bailey
did
mean
to
joke
ase
he
full
of
what
the
papers
call
humor
i
give
in
that
angie
is
about
as
serious
a
matter
as
i
can
think
of
without
settin
down
to
rest
humph
so
fur
we
have
gained
any
knots
to
speak
of
any
more
candidates
on
your
mind
more
possibilities
were
mentioned
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
fill
the
bill
the
conference
broke
up
without
arriving
at
a
decision
bangs
and
the
town
clerk
walked
down
the
hill
together
do
you
know
bailey
said
asaph
the
way
i
look
at
it
this
out
a
housekeeper
for
whit
ai
any
common
job
it
somethin
to
think
over
cy
a
restless
critter
been
cruisin
hither
and
yon
all
his
life
i
sort
of
scared
that
he
get
tired
of
bayport
and
quit
if
things
here
do
go
to
suit
him
now
if
a
real
good
nice
woman
a
nice
lookin
woman
say
was
to
keep
house
for
him
it
it
well
well
i
mean
that
is
do
you
if
some
such
woman
as
that
was
to
be
found
for
the
job
he
might
in
time
come
to
like
her
and
and
er
ase
tidditt
what
are
you
drivin
at
why
i
mean
he
might
come
to
marry
her
there
then
he
be
contented
to
settle
down
to
home
and
stay
put
what
do
you
think
of
the
idea
think
of
it
i
think
it
the
dumdest
foolishness
ever
i
heard
i
declare
if
the
very
mention
of
a
woman
to
some
of
you
old
baches
do
make
your
heads
soften
up
like
a
jellyfish
in
the
sun
ai
cy
whittaker
got
money
ai
he
got
a
nice
home
ai
he
happy
yes
he
is
now
i
but
well
then
and
you
want
him
to
get
married
what
do
you
know
about
marryin
never
tried
it
have
you
course
i
ai
you
know
i
all
right
then
i
keep
quiet
about
such
things
if
i
was
you
need
fly
up
like
a
settin
hen
everybody
wife
ai
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence
what
that
demanded
his
companion
sharply
nothin
nothin
do
care
i
was
only
tryin
to
fix
things
for
whit
has
heman
said
anything
about
the
harbor
appropriation
sence
he
been
home
i
have
heard
of
it
if
he
bangs
answer
was
a
grunt
signifying
a
negative
congressman
atkins
had
been
since
his
return
to
bayport
exceedingly
noncommittal
concerning
the
appropriation
to
tad
simpson
and
a
very
few
chosen
lieutenants
and
intimates
he
had
said
that
he
hoped
to
get
it
that
was
all
this
was
a
disquieting
change
of
attitude
for
at
the
beginning
of
the
term
just
passed
he
had
affirmed
that
he
was
going
to
get
it
however
as
simpson
reassuringly
said
the
job
in
as
good
hands
as
can
be
so
what
the
use
of
our
worryin
bailey
bangs
certainly
was
not
troubled
on
that
score
but
the
town
clerk
proposal
that
captain
cy
be
provided
with
a
suitable
wife
did
worry
him
bailey
was
so
very
much
married
himself
and
had
such
decided
though
unspoken
views
concerning
matrimony
that
such
a
proposal
seemed
to
him
lunacy
pure
and
simple
he
had
liked
and
admired
his
friend
whit
in
the
old
days
when
the
latter
led
them
into
all
sorts
of
boyish
scrapes
now
he
regarded
him
with
a
liking
that
was
close
to
worship
the
captain
was
so
jolly
and
outspoken
so
brave
and
independent
witness
his
crossing
of
the
great
atkins
in
the
matter
of
the
downstairs
teacher
that
was
a
reckless
piece
of
folly
which
would
doubtless
be
rewarded
after
its
kind
but
bailey
though
he
professed
to
condemn
it
secretly
wished
he
had
the
pluck
to
dare
such
things
as
it
was
he
did
dare
contradict
keturah
with
the
exception
of
one
voyage
as
cabin
boy
to
new
orleans
a
voyage
which
convinced
him
that
he
was
not
meant
for
a
seaman
bangs
had
never
been
farther
from
his
native
village
than
boston
captain
cy
had
been
almost
everywhere
and
seen
almost
everything
he
could
spin
yarns
that
beat
the
serial
stories
in
the
patent
inside
of
the
bayport
breeze
all
hollow
bailey
had
figured
that
when
the
fixin
over
was
ended
the
cy
whittaker
place
would
be
for
him
a
delightful
haven
of
refuge
where
he
could
put
his
boots
on
the
furniture
smoke
until
dizzy
without
being
pounced
upon
be
entertained
and
thrilled
with
tales
of
adventure
afloat
and
ashore
and
even
express
his
own
opinion
when
he
had
any
with
the
voice
and
lung
power
of
a
american
citizen
and
now
asaph
tidditt
who
should
know
better
even
though
he
was
a
bachelor
wanted
to
bring
a
wife
into
this
paradise
not
a
paid
domestic
who
could
be
silenced
or
discharged
if
she
became
a
nuisance
but
a
wife
bailey
guessed
not
not
if
he
could
prevent
it
so
he
lay
awake
nights
thinking
of
possible
housekeepers
for
captain
cy
and
carefully
rejecting
all
those
possessing
dangerous
attractions
of
any
kind
each
morning
after
breakfast
he
ran
over
the
list
with
the
captain
taking
care
that
asaph
was
not
present
captain
cy
who
was
very
busy
with
the
finishing
touches
at
the
new
old
house
wearied
on
the
third
morning
there
there
bailey
he
said
do
bother
me
now
i
got
other
things
on
my
mind
how
do
i
know
who
all
these
women
folks
are
stringing
off
to
me
let
me
alone
but
you
must
have
a
housekeeper
cy
you
move
in
monday
and
you
wo
have
nobody
to
oh
dry
up
i
want
to
think
who
i
must
see
this
morning
there
lem
and
old
lady
penniman
and
but
the
housekeeper
cy
do
you
see
hire
one
yourself
then
you
know
i
hey
hire
one
myself
do
you
mean
you
leave
it
in
my
hands
yes
yes
i
guess
so
run
along
that
a
good
he
departed
hurriedly
bangs
scratched
his
head
a
weighty
responsibility
had
been
laid
upon
him
monday
morning
after
breakfast
captain
cy
trunk
was
put
aboard
the
depot
wagon
and
webster
drew
it
to
its
owner
home
the
farewells
at
the
perfect
boarding
house
were
affecting
tripp
said
that
she
had
spoken
to
the
reverend
daniels
and
he
would
be
sure
to
call
the
very
first
thing
keturah
affirmed
that
the
captain
stay
had
been
a
real
pleasure
you
never
find
fault
whittaker
she
said
you
such
a
manly
man
if
you
excuse
my
sayin
so
i
only
wish
there
was
more
like
you
with
a
significant
glance
at
her
husband
as
for
miss
phinney
she
might
have
been
saying
yet
if
the
captain
had
not
excused
himself
asaph
accompanied
his
friend
to
the
house
on
the
hill
the
trunk
was
unloaded
from
the
wagon
and
carried
into
the
bedroom
on
the
first
floor
the
room
which
had
been
captain
cy
so
long
ago
gabe
shrieked
at
webster
and
the
depot
wagon
crawled
away
toward
the
upper
road
got
to
meet
the
up
train
grumbled
the
driver
not
that
anybody
ever
comes
on
it
but
i
i
to
be
there
be
more
talk
than
a
little
if
i
wa
git
dap
you
the
moral
so
you
goin
to
do
your
own
cookin
for
a
spell
cy
observed
asaph
a
half
hour
later
well
i
guess
that
a
good
idea
till
you
can
find
the
right
housekeeper
i
ai
been
able
to
think
of
one
that
would
suit
you
nor
i
either
neither
bailey
i
judge
though
for
a
while
he
was
as
full
of
suggestions
as
a
pine
grove
is
of
woodticks
he
started
to
say
somethin
about
it
to
me
last
night
but
ketury
hove
in
sight
and
yanked
him
off
to
prayer
yes
i
know
she
to
get
him
into
heaven
i
guess
be
heaven
for
her
unless
he
was
round
to
pick
at
there
he
comes
now
how
he
get
out
of
wipin
dishes
bangs
strolled
into
the
yard
hello
he
hailed
i
was
on
my
way
to
simmons
on
an
errand
and
i
thought
i
stop
in
a
minute
got
somethin
to
tell
you
all
right
overboard
with
it
it
wo
keep
long
this
hot
bailey
smiled
knowingly
did
i
hear
the
up
train
whistle
as
i
was
comin
along
he
asked
seems
to
me
i
did
yes
well
if
i
mistaken
somebody
comin
on
that
train
somebody
for
you
cy
somebody
for
me
um
hum
i
can
be
depended
on
i
and
when
you
says
to
me
you
get
me
a
housekeeper
i
did
lose
much
time
i
got
tidditt
gasped
got
her
he
repeated
got
who

what
bailey
bangs
what
in
the
world
have
belay
ase
ordered
captain
cy
bailey
what
are
you
givin
us
givin
you
a
housekeeper
and
a
good
one
too
i
should
wonder
she
may
not
be
one
of
them
prize
museum
beauties
with
a
scornful
wink
at
asaph
but
if
what
i
hear
true
she
can
keep
house
anyhow
she
kept
one
for
forty
odd
year
her
name
deborah
beasley
she
a
widow
over
to
east
trumet
and
if
i
do
miss
my
guess
in
the
depot
wagon
now
headed
in
this
captain
cy
whistled
tidditt
was
too
much
surprised
to
do
even
that
i
was
speakin
to
the
feller
that
drives
the
candy
cart
continued
bailey
and
i
asked
him
if
he
run
acrost
anybody
durin
his
trips
the
country
who
be
likely
to
hire
out
for
a
housekeeper
he
thought
a
spell
and
then
named
over
some
among
was
this
beasley
one
i
asked
some
more
questions
and
the
answers
bein
satisfactory
to
me
though
they
might
not
be
to
some
folks
another
derisive
wink
at
asaph
i
set
down
and
wrote
her
tellin
what

what

to
do
and
when

the

cried

asaph

old

the
captain
resignedly
there
no
use
in
about
what

helped
bailey
says
he
shipped
her
for
a
trial
and
here
comes

scraggy
female
wearing
a
black
beflowered

and
a
black

black
knit
shawl
was
draped
about
her
shoulders
and

he
accompanied
the
final
bellow
with
an
expressive
pantomime
indicating
that
the
passenger
was
expected
to
alight
she
seemed
to
understand
for
she
opened
the
door
of
the
carriage
and
slowly
descended
bangs
advanced
to
meet
her
how
d
do
beasley
he
said
glad
to
see

all
safe
and
beasley
shook
his
hand

covered
as
far
as
the
knuckles
by
black
mitts
how

do
whittaker
she
said
in
a
shrill
voice
you
pretty
smart
bailey
hastened
to
explain
i
ai
whittaker
he
roared
i
bailey
bangs
the
one
that
wrote
to
hey
lumley
and
asaph
chuckled
bailey
colored
and
tried
again
i
ai
the
he
whooped
here
he
is
here
he
led
her
over
to
her
prospective
employer
and
tapped
the
latter
on
the
chest
how
d
do
sir
said
the
housekeeper
i
do
know
i
just
caught
your
in
five
minutes
or
so
the
situation
was
made
reasonably
clear
beasley
then
demanded
her
trunk
and
carpet
bag
the
grinning
lumley
bore
them
into
the
house
then
he
drove
away
still
grinning
bailey
looked
fearfully
at
captain
cy
she
is
kind
of
hard
of
hearin
ai
she
he
said
reluctantly
you
remember
i
said
she
the
captain
nodded
yes
he
answered
you
a
chap
bailey
i
say
that
for
you
you
do
exaggerate
your
hard
of
hearin
snapped
tidditt
if
the
last
trump
ai
a
steam
whistle
she
miss
judgment
day
i
stop
into
simmons
on
my
way
along
and
buy
you
a
bottle
of
throat
balsam
cy
you
goin
to
need
the
captain
needed
more
than
throat
balsam
during
the
fortnight
which
followed
the
widow
beasley
deafness
was
not
her
only
failing
in
fact
she
was
altogether
a
failure
so
far
as
her
housekeeping
was
concerned
she
could
cook
after
a
fashion
but
the
fashion
was
so
limited
that
even
the
bill
of
fare
at
the
perfect
boarding
house
looked
tempting
in
retrospect
baked
beans
again
cy
exclaimed
asaph
dropping
in
one
evening
after
supper
saturday
night
so
soon
is
it
no
was
the
dismal
rejoinder
it
tuesday
if
my
almanac
ai
out
of
joint
but
we
had
beans
saturday
and
they
ai
all
gone
yet
so
i
presume
we
have
till
the
last
one
swallowed
aunt
debby
got
what
the
piece
in
the
reader
used
to
call
a
mind
she
intend
to
waste
anything
last
thursday
i
spunked
up
courage
enough
to
yell
for
salt
fish
and
potatoes
fixed
up
with
pork
scraps
you
know
same
we
used
to
have
when
i
was
a
boy
we
had
all
right
and
if
beans
of
a
saturday
had
been
part
of
her
religion
we
be
warmin
up
yet
i
took
in
a
cat
for
company
day
but
the
run
away
to
see
it
look
at
the
beans
in
its
saucer
and
then
at
me
was
pitiful
i
felt
like
handin
myself
over
to
the
cruelty
to
is
she
neat
inquired
tidditt
i
do
know
i
guess
so
on
the
installment
plan
it
takes
her
a
week
to
scrub
up
the
kitchen
and
then
one
end
of
it
is
so
dirty
she
has
to
begin
again
consequently
the
dust
is
so
thick
in
the
rest
of
the
house
that
i
can
see
my
tracks
if
so
late
in
the
season
i
plant
garden
stuff
in
the
parlor
nice
soil
and
lots
of
shade
with
the
curtains
from
the
rooms
in
the
rear
came
the
words
of
a
gospel
hymn
sung
in
a
tremulous
soprano
and
at
concert
pitch
music
with
my
meals
just
like
a
restaurant
commented
captain
cy
but
what
makes
her
sing
so
everlastin
loud
ca
hear
herself
if
she
do
i
could
stand
her
deefness
because
that
an
affliction
and
we
may
all
come
to
it
but
the
housekeeper
still
singing
entered
the
room
and
planted
herself
in
a
chair
good
evenin
tidditt
she
said
smiling
genially
nice
weather
we
been
asaph
nodded
sociable
critter
ai
she
observed
the
captain
always
willin
to
help
entertain
comes
and
sets
up
with
me
till
bedtime
tells
about
her
family
troubles
preaches
about
her
niece

west
and
how

the
rest
of
the
western

shrieked
turning
to
the
old
lady

continued
the
master
of
the
house
she
stay
with
us
till
the
last
gun
fires
day
angie
phinney
called
and
i
turned
debby
loose
on
her
i
did
believe
anything
could
wear
out
angie
talkin
machinery
but
she
did
it
angeline
stayed
twenty
minutes
and
then
quit
hoarse
as
a
here
the
widow
joined
in
the
conversation
evidently
under
the
impression
that
nothing
had
been
said
since
she
last
spoke
continuing
her
favorable
comments
on
the
weather
she
observed
that
she
was
glad
there
was
so
little
fog
because
fog
was
hard
for
folks
with
neuralgy
her
brother
wife
cousin
had
neuralgy
for
years
and
she
described
his
sufferings
with
enthusiasm
and
infinite
detail
tidditt
answered
her
questions
verbally
at
first
later
by
nods
and
shakes
of
the
head
captain
cy
fidgeted
in
his
chair
come
on
outdoor
ase
he
said
at
last
no
use
to
wait
till
she
runs
down
she
a
guaranteed
to
keep
goin
for
a
year
he
shouted
addressing
beasley
and
heading
for
the
door
where
you
goin
asked
the
old
lady
no
yes
who
said
so
hooray
three
cheers
for
scott
come
on
ase
and
the
captain
seizing
his
friend
by
the
arm
dragged
him
into
the
open
air
and
slammed
the
door
are
you
crazy
demanded
the
astonished
town
clerk
what
makes
you
talk
like
that
might
as
well
she
would
understand
it
any
better
if
was
scripture
and
it
saves
brain
work
the
only
satisfaction
i
get
is
bein
able
to
give
my
opinion
of
her
and
the
grub
without
hurtin
her
feelin
if
i
called
her
a
jumpin
jack
she
only
smile
and
say
no
she
did
think
was
goin
to
rain
or
somethin
just
as
well
why
do
you
give
her
her
walkin
papers
i
shall
when
her
month
i
would
wait
no
month
i
heave
her
overboard
you
hear
me
captain
cy
shook
his
head
i
ca
very
well
he
replied
i
hate
to
make
her
feel
too
bad
when
the
month
over
i
have
some
excuse
ready
maybe
the
joke
of
it
is
that
she
do
really
need
to
work
out
she
got
some
money
of
her
own
owns
cranberry
swamps
and
i
do
know
what
all
says
she
took
up
bailey
offer
she
i
be
company
for
her
i
had
to
laugh
even
in
the
face
of
those
beans
when
she
said
humph
if
i
do
tell
bailey
what
i
think
of
him
then
no
no
do
you
say
a
word
to
bailey
it
principally
on
his
account
that
i
tryin
to
stick
it
out
for
the
month
bailey
did
his
best
he
thought
he
was
helpin
and
he
feels
dreadfully
because
she
so
deef
only
yesterday
he
asked
me
if
i
believed
there
was
anything
made
that
would
fix
her
up
and
make
it
more
comfortable
for
me
i
could
have
prescribed
a
shotgun
but
i
did
you
see
he
thinks
her
deefness
is
the
only
trouble
i
have
told
him
the
rest
and
do
you
do
it
either
bailey
a
humph
his
heart
may
be
good
but
his
head
goin
to
seed
i
keep
quiet
if
please
you
yes
and
see
here
ase
i
do
care
to
be
the
laughin
stock
of
bayport
if
any
of
the
folks
ask
you
how
i
like
my
new
housekeeper
you
tell
there
nothin
like
her
anywhere
that
no
so
beasley
stayed
on
at
the
whittaker
place
and
thanks
to
tidditt
the
general
opinion
of
inquisitive
bayport
was
that
the
new
housekeeper
was
a
grand
success
only
captain
cy
and
asaph
knew
the
whole
truth
and
bangs
a
part
that
part
deborah
deafness
troubled
him
not
a
little
and
he
thought
much
concerning
it
as
a
result
of
this
thinking
he
wrote
a
letter
to
a
relative
in
boston
the
answer
to
this
letter
pleased
him
and
he
wrote
again
one
afternoon
during
the
third
week
of
beasley
stay
asaph
called
and
found
captain
cy
in
the
sitting
room
reading
the
breeze
the
captain
urged
his
friend
to
remain
and
have
supper
we
run
out
of
beans
ase
he
explained
and
are
just
startin
in
on
a
course
of
boiled
cod
do
stay
and
eat
a
lot
then
there
wo
be
so
much
to
warm
tidditt
accepted
the
invitation
also
a
section
of
the
breeze
while
they
were
reading
they
heard
the
back
door
slam
it
the
graven
image
explained
the
captain
she
been
on
a
cruise
down
town
somewheres
be
a
lot
of
sore
throats
in
that
direction
the
town
clerk
looked
up
there
now
he
exclaimed
i
believe

her
i
saw
walkin
with
bailey
a
spell
ago
i
thought
so
but
i
did
have
my
specs

i
with
bailey
hey
humph

is
serious
hope
ketury
did
see
we
must
have
any
the
housekeeper
entered
the
dining
room
she
was
singing
beulah
land
but
her
tone
was
more
subdued
than
usual
they
heard
her
setting
the
table
how
she
gettin
along
asked
asaph
progressin
backwards
same
as
ever
she
no
better
thank
you
and
the
doctor
given
up
when

goin
to
tell
her

the
question
i
say
when
is
she
goin
to
be
bounced
deefness
ai
catchin
is
it
i
would
wonder
if
it
might
be
if
is
mine
ought
to
be
fast
what
makes
her
so
still
all
at
once
gone
to
the
kitchen
i
guess

she
has
sailed
in
and
set
down
with
us
old
chromo
you
must
be
glad
her
month
most
up
asaph
proceeded
to
give
his
opinion
of
the
housekeeper
raising
his
voice
almost
to
a
howl
as
his
indignation
grew
if
beasley
ears
had
been
ordinary
ones
she
might
have
heard
the
unflattering
description
in
the
kitchen
as
it
was
tidditt
felt
no
fear
comin
here
so
you
could
be
company
for
her
the
idea
good
to
herself
ai
she
godfrey
scissors
and
bailey
was
fool
enough
to
there
there
do
let
it
worry
you
ase
i
about
decided
what
to
say
when
i
let
her
go
i
tell
her
she
is
gettin
too
old
to
be
slavin
herself
to
death
you
see
i
do
want
to
make
the
old
critter
cry
nor
i
do
want
her
to
get
mad
judgin
by
the
way
she
used
to
coax
the
cat
outdoors
with
the
broom
handle
she
got
somethin
of
a
temper
when
she
gets
started
i
give
her
an
extry
month
wages
and
you
will
hey
you
will
the
interruption
came
from
behind
the
partially
closed
door
tidditt
sank
back
in
his
chair
captain
cy
sprang
from
his
and
threw
the
door
wide
open
behind
it
crouched
deborah
beasley
her
eyes
snapped
behind
her
spectacles
her
lean
form
was
trembling
all
over
and
in
her
right
hand
she
held
a
mammoth
trumpet
the
smaller
end
of
which
was
connected
with
her
ear
you
will
hey
she
screamed
brandishing
her
left
fist
but
still
keeping
the
ear
trumpet
in
place
with
her
right
you
will
well
i
do
want
none
of
your
money
land
knows
how
you
made
it
anyhow
and
i
would
soil
my
hands
with
it
after
all
i
put
up
with
and
the
way
i
done
my
work
and
the
things
i
had
to
eat
and
and
she
paused
for
breath
captain
cy
scratched
his
chin
asaph
gazing
at
the
trumpet
stirred
in
his
chair
beasley
swooped
down
upon
him
like
a
gull
on
a
minnow
and
you
she
shrieked
you
a
miserable
little
lazy
ridiculous
oo
oo
oh
you
call
yourself
a
town
clerk
you
do
i
i
would
have
you
clerk
for
a
hen
house
i
an
old
chromo
be
i
yes
that
nice
talk
ai
it
to
a
woman
old
enough
to
be
that
is
er
er
as
old
as
you
be
you
sneakin
little
fat
thing
you
you
oh
i
ca
lay
my
tongue
to
words
to
tell
you
what
you
you
doin
pretty
well
seems
to
me
observed
captain
cy
dryly
i
would
be
discouraged
if
i
was
the
only
effect
of
this
remark
was
to
turn
the
wordy
torrent
in
his
direction
the
captain
bore
it
for
a
while
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
commanded
silence
that
enough
stop
it
he
ordered
and
strange
to
say
beasley
did
stop
i
sorry
debby
he
went
on
but
you
had
no
business
to
be
listenin
even
if
and
he
smiled
grimly
you
have
got
a
new
fog
horn
to
hear
with
you
can
go
and
pack
your
things
as
soon
as
you
want
to
i
made
up
my
mind
the
first
day
you
come
that
you
and
me
would
cruise
together
long
and
this
only
shortens
the
trip
by
a
week
or
so
i
pay
you
for
this
month
and
for
the
next
and
i
guess
when
you
come
to
think
it
over
you
be
willin
to
risk
soilin
your
hands
with
the
money
it
your
own
fault
if
anybody
knows
that
you
did
leave
of
your
own
accord
sha
tell
and
i
see
that
tidditt
does
now
trot
ase
and
i
get
supper
it
was
evident
that
the
had
much
more
which
she
would
have
liked
to
say
but
there
was
that
in
her
late
employer
manner
which
caused
her
to
forbear
she
slammed
out
of
the
room
and
they
heard
her
banging
things
about
on
the
floor
above
but
where
where
repeated
tidditt
over
and
over
did
she
get
that
trumpet
the
puzzle
was
solved
soon
after
when
bailey
bangs
entered
the
house
in
a
high
state
of
excitement
well
he
demanded
expectantly
did
they
help
her
has
anything
happened
happened
began
asaph
but
captain
cy
silenced
him
by
a
wink
yes
answered
the
captain
something
happened
why
hurrah
i
thought
she
can
hear
better
ca
she
yes
i
guess
it
safe
to
say
she
good
you
can
thank
me
for
it
when
i
see
how
dreadful
deef
she
was
i
wrote
my
cousin
eddie
t
who
an
optician
up
to
boston
you
know
him
ase
and
i
says
you
know
what
good
for
folks
who
ca
see
ai
there
nothin
says
i
help
them
who
ca
hear
how
about
ear
trumpets
and
ed
wrote
that
an
ear
trumpet
would
probably
help
some
but
why
did
i
try
a
pair
of
them
patent
fixin
that
are
made
to
put
inside
deef
people
ears
he
known
of
cases
where
they
helped
a
lot
so
i
sent
for
a
pair
and
the
biggest
ear
trumpet
made
besides
and
when
i
met
debby
i
give
to
her
and
told
her
to
put
the
patent
things
in
her
ears
and
couple
on
the
trumpet
outside
and
not
to
say
nothin
to
you
but
just
surprise
you
and
it
did
surprise
you
did
it
the
wrathful
tidditt
could
wait
no
longer
he
burst
into
a
vivid
description
of
the
bailey
was
aghast
captain
cy
laughed
until
his
face
was
purple
i
declare
cy
exclaimed
the
dejected
purchaser
of
the
ear
fixin
and
the
trumpet
i
do
declare
i
awful
sorry
if
you
only
told
me
she
was
no
good
i
have
let
her
alone
but
i
thought
was
just
the
deefness
i
i
i
know
bailey
you
meant
well
like
the
doctor
who
rubbed
the
rheumatic
man
wooden
leg
all
right
forgive
you
was
worth
it
all
to
see
asaph
face
when
marm
beasley
was
him
ha
ha
oh
dear
me
i
laughed
till
i
sore
but
there
one
thing
i
should
like
to
do
if
you
do
mind
i
should
like
to
pick
out
my
next
housekeeper
chapter
v
a
caller
beasley
departed
next
morning
taking
with
her
the
extra
wages
in
spite
of
fervid
avowals
that
she
would
touch
a
cent
of
it
on
the
way
to
the
depot
she
favored
lumley
with
sundry
hints
concerning
the
reasons
for
her
departure
she
could
stand
it
no
longer
if
folks
only
knew
what
she
had
to
put
up
with
she
they
be
some
surprised
she
could
tell
a
few
things
if
she
wanted
to
and
so
on
incidentally
she
was
kind
of
glad
she
did
like
the
place
because
now
she
she
should
go
west
and
visit
her
niece
they
been
wanting
her
to
come
for
so
long
gabe
was
much
interested
and
repeated
the
monologue
with
imaginative
additions
to
the
depot
master
who
in
turn
repeated
it
to
his
wife
when
he
went
home
to
dinner
that
lady
attended
sewing
circle
in
the
afternoon
next
day
a
large
share
of
bayport
conversation
dealt
with
the
housekeeper
leaving
and
her
reasons
therefor
the
reasons
differed
widely
according
to
the
portion
of
the
town
in
which
they
were
discussed
but
it
was
the
general
opinion
that
the
whole
affair
was
not
creditable
to
captain
whittaker
only
at
the
perfect
boarding
house
was
the
captain
upheld
miss
phinney
declared
that
she
knew
he
had
made
a
mistake
as
soon
as
she
heard
the
beasley
woman
talk
nobody
else
so
angeline
declared
could
get
a
word
in
tripp
sighed
and
affirmed
that
going
out
of
town
for
a
woman
to
do
housework
was
ridiculous
on
the
face
of
it
there
were
plenty
of
bayport
ladies
women
of
capability
and
sound
in
their
religious
views
who
might
be
hired
if
they
were
approached
in
the
right
way
keturah
gave
as
her
opinion
that
if
the
captain
knew
when
he
was
well
off
he
would
take
his
meals
asaph
snorted
and
intimated
that
that
debby
beasley
was
fit
to
keep
house
in
a
pigsty
and
anybody
but
a
born
gump
would
have
known
bailey
the
born
gump
said
nothing
but
looked
appealingly
at
his
chum
as
for
captain
cy
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
affirm
or
deny
the
rumors
peace
and
quiet
dominated
the
whittaker
house
for
the
first
time
in
three
weeks
and
its
owner
was
happier
he
cooked
his
own
food
and
washed
his
own
dishes
the
runaway
cat
ventured
to
return
found
other
viands
than
beans
in
its
saucer
and
decided
to
remain
purring
thankful
contentment
the
captain
made
his
own
bed
after
a
fashion
when
he
was
ready
to
occupy
it
but
he
was
conscious
that
it
might
be
better
made
he
refused
however
to
spend
his
time
in
sweeping
and
dusting
and
the
dust
continued
to
accumulate
on
the
carpets
and
furniture
this
condition
of
affairs
troubled
him
but
he
kept
his
own
counsel
asaph
and
bailey
called
often
but
they
offered
no
more
suggestions
as
to
hiring
a
housekeeper
tidditt
might
have
done
so
but
the
captain
gave
him
no
encouragement
bangs
recent
humiliation
fresh
in
his
mind
would
as
soon
have
suggested
setting
the
house
on
fire
one
evening
asaph
happened
in
on
his
way
to
simmons
he
desired
the
captain
to
accompany
him
to
that
gathering
place
of
the
wise
and
talkative
captain
cy
was
in
the
sitting
room
a
sheet
of
note
paper
in
his
hand
the
town
clerk
entered
without
ceremony
and
tossed
his
hat
on
the
sofa
evenin
ase
observed
the
captain
folding
the
sheet
of
paper
and
putting
it
into
his
pocket
glad
you
come
sit
down
i
wanted
to
ask
you
all
right
here
i
be
heave
ahead
and
captain
cy
puffed
at
his
pipe
he
seemed
about
to
speak
and
then
to
think
better
of
it
for
he
crossed
his
legs
and
smoked
on
in
silence
gazing
at
the
nickel
work
of
the
stove
it
was
badly
in
need
of
polishing
well
inquired
asaph
with
impatient
sarcasm
thinkin
of
askin
me
to
build
a
fire
for
you
was
you
nobody
else
but
you
would
have
set
up
a
stove
in
summer
time
hey
no
you
need
start
a
fire
yet
awhile
that
necktie
of
yours

us
warm
till

i
should
wonder
new
one
ai
it
you
get
it
tidditt
was
wearing
a
crocheted
scarf
of
a
brilliant
crimson
hue
particularly
becoming
to
his
complexion
the
complexion
now
brightened
until
it
was
almost
a
match
for
the
tie
oh
he
said
with
elaborate
indifference
that
yes
it
new
yesterday
was
my
birthday
and
matildy
tripp

knew
i
needed
a
necktie
so

that
would
be
pretty
manners

need
talk
about
widders

after
debby
ho

captain
cy
chuckled
then
he
suddenly
became
serious
ase
he
said

the
time
when
the
howes

had
this
house

what

how
the
boarders

to
say
she

more
than
all

sea

good
hotel
young

to
me
i
did
hear
she
was
married
see
here
whit
what
is
it
about
her
tell
a
feller
come
but
captain
cy
refused
to
gratify
his
chum
lively
curiosity
also
he
refused
to
go
to
simmons
that
evening
saying
that
he
was
tired
and
guessed
he
stay
at
home
and
turn
in
tidditt
departed
grumbling
after
he
had
gone
the
captain
drew
his
chair
nearer
the
center
table
took
from
his
pocket
a
sheet
of
notepaper
and
proceeded
to
read
what
was
written
on
its
pages
it
was
a
letter
which
he
had
received
nearly
a
month
before
and
had
not
yet
answered
during
the
past
week
he
had
read
it
many
times
the
writing
was
cramped
and
blotted
and
the
paper
cheap
and
dingy
the
envelope
bore
the
postmark
of
a
small
town
in
indiana
and
the
inclosure
was
worded
as
follows
captain
cyrus
whittaker
dear
sir
i
suppose
you
will
be
a
good
deal
surprised
to
hear
from
me
especially
from
way
out
west
here
when
you
bought
the
old
house
of
seth
he
and
i
was
living
in
concord
he
could
make
a
go
of
his
business
there
so
we
came
west
and
he
has
been
sick
most
of
the
time
since
we
ai
well
off
like
you
and
times
are
hard
with
us
what
i
wanted
to
write
you
about
was
this
my
cousin
mary
thomas
mary
thayer
that
was
is
still
living
in
concord
and
she
is
poor
and
needs
help
though
i
do
suppose
she
would
ask
for
it
being
too
proud
false
pride
i
call
it
me
and
seth
would
like
to
do
something
for
her
but
we
have
a
hard
enough
job
to
keep
going
ourselves
mary
married
a
man
by
the
name
of
henry
thomas
and
he
turned
out
to
be
a
miserable
as
i
always
said
he
would
she
would
listen
to
me
though
he
run
off
and
left
her
seven
year
ago
last
april
and
i
understand
was
killed
or
drowned
somewheres
up
in
montana
mary
and
several
words
scratched
out
here
got
along
somehow
since
but
i
know
how
while
we
lived
in
concord
seth
sort
of
kept
an
eye
on
her
but
now
he
ca
of
course
she
a
good
girl
or
woman
rather
being
most
forty
and
would
make
a
good
housekeeper
if
you
should
need
one
as
i
suppose
likely
you
will
if
you
could
help
her
it
would
be
an
act
of
charity
and
you
will
be
rewarded
above
seth
says
why
not
write
to
her
and
tell
her
to
come
and
see
you
he
feels
bad
about
her
because
he
is
so
sick
i
suppose
and
he
knows
you
are
rich
and
could
do
good
if
you
felt
like
it
her
father
name
was
john
thayer
i
would
wonder
if
you
used
to
know
her
mother
she
was
emily
richards
afore
she
married
and
they
used
to
live
in
orham
yours
truly
elizabeth
howes
mary
address
is
mary
thomas
care
oliver
blank
street
concord
h
seth
wo
say
so
but
i
will
we
are
very
hard
up
ourselves
and
if
you
could
help
him
and
me
with
the
loan
of
a
little
money
it
would
be
thankfully
received
captain
cy
read
the
letter
folded
it
and
replaced
it
in
his
pocket
he
knew
the
howes
family
by
reputation
and
the
reputation
was
that
of
general
sharpness
in
trade
and
stinginess
in
money
matters
personal
appeal
did
not
therefore
touch
his
heart
to
any
great
extent
he
surmised
also
that
for
seth
howes
and
his
wife
to
ask
help
for
some
person
other
than
themselves
premised
a
darky
in
the
woodpile
somewhere
but
for
the
daughter
of
emily
richards
to
be
suggested
as
a
possible
housekeeper
at
the
cy
whittaker
place
that
was
interesting
certainly
when
the
captain
was
not
a
captain
when
he
was
merely
young
cy
a
boy
living
with
his
parents
a
dancing
school
was
organized
in
bayport
it
was
an
innovation
for
our
village
and
frowned
upon
by
many
of
the
older
and
stricter
inhabitants
however
most
of
the
boy
friends
were
permitted
to
attend
young
cy
was
not
his
father
considered
dancing
a
waste
of
time
and
if
not
wicked
certainly
frivolous
and
nonsensical
so
the
boy
remained
at
home
but
in
spite
of
the
parental
order
he
practiced
some
of
the
figures
of
the
quadrilles
and
the
contra
dances
in
his
comrades
barns
learning
them
at
second
hand
so
to
speak
one
winter
there
was
to
be
a
party
in
orham
given
by
the
nickersons
wealthy
people
with
a
daughter
it
was
to
be
a
grand
affair
and
most
of
the
boys
and
girls
in
the
neighboring
towns
were
invited
cy
received
an
invitation
and
for
a
wonder
was
permitted
to
attend
the
bayport
contingent
went
over
in
a
big
hayrick
on
runners
and
the
moonlight
ride
was
jolly
enough
the
nickerson
mansion
was
crowded
and
there
were
music
and
dancing
young
cy
was
miserable
during
the
dancing
he
did
dare
attempt
it
in
spite
of
his
lessons
in
the
barn
so
while
the
rest
of
his
boy
friends
sought
partners
for
the
portland
fancy
and
hull
victory
he
sat
forlorn
in
a
corner
as
he
sat
there
he
was
approached
by
a
young
lady
radiant
in
muslin
and
ribbons
she
was
three
or
four
years
older
than
he
was
and
he
had
worshipped
her
from
afar
as
she
whirled
up
and
down
the
line
in
the
virginia
reel
she
never
lacked
partners
and
seemed
to
be
a
great
favorite
with
the
young
men
especially
one
chap
with
a
sunburned
face
who
looked
like
a
sailor
they
were
forming
sets
for
money
musk
it
was
ladies
choice
and
there
was
a
demand
for
more
couples
the
young
lady
came
ever
to
corner
and
laughingly
dropped
him
a
courtesy
if
you
please
she
said
i
want
a
partner
will
you
do
me
the
honor
cy
blushingly
avowed
that
he
could
dance
any
to
speak
of
oh
yes
you
can
i
sure
you
can
you
the
whittaker
boy
you
i
heard
about
your
barn
lessons
and
i
want
you
to
try
this
with
me
please
do
no
john
she
added
turning
to
the
sunburned
young
fellow
who
had
followed
her
across
the
room
this
is
my
choice
and
here
is
my
partner
susie
taylor
is
after
you
and
you
must
run
away
come
so
cy
took
her
arm
and
they
danced
money
musk
together
he
made
but
a
few
mistakes
and
these
she
helped
him
to
correct
so
easily
that
none
noticed
his
success
gave
him
courage
and
he
essayed
other
dances
in
fact
he
had
a
very
good
time
at
the
party
after
all
on
the
way
home
he
thought
a
great
deal
about
the
pretty
young
lady
whose
name
he
discovered
was
emily
richards
he
decided
that
if
she
would
only
wait
for
him
he
might
like
to
marry
her
when
he
grew
up
but
he
was
thirteen
and
she
was
seventeen
and
the
very
next
year
she
married
john
thayer
the
sailor
in
the
blue
suit
and
two
years
after
that
young
cy
ran
away
to
be
a
sailor
himself
in
spite
of
his
age
and
his
lifetime
of
battering
about
the
world
captain
cy
had
a
sentimental
streak
in
his
makeup
his
rejuvenation
of
the
old
home
proved
that
betsy
letter
interested
him
he
had
made
guarded
inquiries
concerning
mary
thayer
now
mary
thomas
of
others
besides
asaph
and
the
answers
had
been
satisfactory
so
far
as
they
went
those
who
remembered
her
had
liked
her
very
much
the
captain
had
even
begun
a
letter
to
thomas
but
laid
it
aside
unfinished
having
since
bailey
unfortunate
experience
with
the
widow
beasley
a
prejudice
against
experiments
but
this
evening
before
tidditt
called
he
had
been
thinking
that
something
would
have
to
be
done
and
done
soon
the
generally
shiftless
condition
of
his
domestic
surroundings
was
getting
to
be
unbearable
dust
and
dirt
did
not
fit
into
his
mental
picture
of
the
old
home
as
it
used
to
be
and
as
he
had
tried
to
restore
it
there
had
been
neither
dust
nor
dirt
in
his
mother
day
he
meditated
and
smoked
for
another
hour
then
his
mind
being
made
up
he
pulled
down
the
desk
lid
of
the
secretary
resurrected
from
a
pile
of
papers
the
note
he
had
begun
to
thomas
dipped
a
sputtering
pen
into
the
ink
bottle
and
proceeded
to
write
his
letter
was
a
short
one
and
rather
noncommittal
as
thomas
no
doubt
knew
he
had
come
back
to
live
in
his
father
house
at
bayport
he
might
possibly
need
some
one
to
keep
house
for
him
he
understood
that
she
mary
thayer
that
was
was
a
good
housekeeper
and
that
she
was
open
to
an
engagement
if
everything
was
mutually
satisfactory
he
had
known
her
mother
slightly
when
the
latter
lived
in
orham
he
thought
an
interview
might
be
pleasant
for
they
could
talk
over
old
times
if
nothing
more
perhaps
on
the
whole
she
might
care
to
risk
a
trip
to
bayport
therefore
he
inclosed
money
for
her
railroad
fare
you
understand
of
course
so
he
wrote
in
conclusion
that
nothing
may
come
of
our
meeting
at
all
so
please
do
say
a
word
to
anybody
when
you
strike
town
you
lived
here
yourself
and
you
know
that
three
words
hove
overboard
in
bayport
will
dredge
up
gab
enough
to
sink
a
dictionary
so
just
keep
mum
till
the
business
is
settled
one
way
or
the
he
put
on
his
hat
and
went
down
to
the
post
office
where
he
dropped
his
letter
in
the
slot
of
the
box
fastened
to
the
front
door
then
he
returned
home
and
retired
at
exactly
eleven
in
spite
of
his
remarks
to
asaph
he
had
not
turned
in
so
early
after
all
if
the
captain
expected
a
prompt
reply
to
his
note
he
was
disappointed
a
week
passed
and
he
heard
nothing
then
three
more
days
and
still
no
word
from
the
new
hampshire
widow
meanwhile
fresh
layers
of
dust
spread
themselves
over
the
whittaker
furniture
and
the
gaudy
patterns
of
the
carpets
blushed
dimly
beneath
a
grimy
fog
the
situation
was
desperate
even
matilda
tripp
sermons
and
all
began
to
be
thinkable
as
a
possibility
the
eleventh
day
began
with
a
pouring
rain
that
changed
later
on
to
a
dismal
drizzle
the
tree
in
the
front
yard
dripped
and
the
overflowing
gutters
gurgled
and
splashed
the
bay
was
gray
and
lonely
and
the
fish
weirs
along
the
outer
bar
were
lost
in
the
mist
the
flowers
in
the
atkins
urns
were
draggled
and
beaten
down
only
the
iron
dogs
glistened
undaunted
as
the
wet
ran
off
their
newly
painted
backs
the
air
was
heavy
and
the
salty
flavor
of
the
flats
might
almost
be
tasted
in
it
captain
cy
was
in
the
sitting
room
as
usual
his
spirits
were
as
gray
as
the
weather
he
was
actually
lonesome
for
the
first
time
since
his
return
home
he
had
kindled
a
wood
fire
in
the
stove
just
for
the
sociability
of
it
and
the
crackle
and
glow
behind
the
isinglass
panes
only
served
to
remind
him
of
other
days
and
other
fires
the
sitting
room
had
not
been
lonesome
then
he
heard
the
depot
wagon
rattle
by
and
peering
from
the
window
saw
that
except
for
lumley
it
was
empty
not
even
a
summer
boarder
had
come
to
brighten
our
ways
and
lawns
with
reckless
raiment
and
the
newest
slang
summer
boarding
season
was
almost
over
now
bayport
would
soon
be
as
dull
as
dish
water
and
the
captain
admitted
to
himself
that
it
was
dull
he
had
half
a
mind
to
take
a
flying
trip
to
boston
make
the
round
of
the
wharves
and
see
if
any
of
the
old
shipowners
and
ship
captains
whom
he
had
once
known
were
still
alive
and
in
harness
jingle
jingle
jingle
jingle
jingle
jing
jing
jing
captain
cy
bounced
in
his
chair
that
was
the
bell
the
bell
who
on
earth
or
rather
who
in
bayport
would
come
to
the
front
door
he
hurried
through
the
dim
grandeur
of
the
best
parlor
and
entered
the
little
dark
front
hall
the
bell
was
still
swinging
at
the
end
of
its
coil
of
wire
the
dust
shaken
from
it
still
hung
in
the
air
the
captain
unbolted
and
unlocked
the
big
front
door
a
girl
was
standing
on
the
steps
between
the
lines
of
box
hedge
a
little
girl
under
a
big
umbrella
the
wet
dripped
from
the
umbrella
top
and
from
the
hem
of
the
little
girl
dress
captain
cy
stared
hard
at
his
visitor
he
knew
most
of
the
children
in
bayport
but
he
did
know
this
one
obviously
she
was
a
stranger
portuguese
children
from
up
harniss
way
sometimes
called
to
peddle
huckleberries
but
this
child
was
no

exclaimed
the
captain
wonderingly
did

the
bell

replied
the
girl
humph

thought

crape
captain
cy
gasped
what
in
the
world

in
your
head
well
i
did

but
maybe
that
was
why
you
thought
i
had

to
have
rung
it
when
mamma
was
sick
they
did
let
people
ring
our
bell
and
when
she
died
they
tied
it
up
with
did
hey
hum
the
captain
scratched
his
chin
and
gazed
at
the
small
figure
before
him
it
was
a
figure
for
such
a
little
one
and
out
there
in
the
rain
under
the
tent
roof
of
the
umbrella
it
was
rather
pitiful

the
child

she
extended
the
big
umbrella
at
arm
length
holding
it
with
both
hands

minute
he
sprang
down
the
steps

the
umbrella
seized
her
by
the
arm
and
led
her
into
the
house
through
the
parlor
and
into
the
sitting
room
where
the
fire
crackled
invitingly
he
could
feel
that
the
dress
sleeve
under
his
hand
was
wet
through
and
the
worn
boots
and
darned
stockings
he
could
see

soaked

bedroom
and
returned
with
a
heavy
reefer
jacket
ordering
his
caller
to
stand
up

slipped
her
arms
into
the
sleeves
and
turned
the
collar
up
about
her
neck
her
braided
pigtail
of
yellow
hair
stuck
out
over
the
collar
and
hung
down
her
back
in
a
funny
way
the
coat
sleeves
reached
almost
to
her
knees

the
coat
itself
enveloped
her

envelope
captain
cy

a
dazed
fashion
and
drew
a
long
breath

the
envelope
and
read
the
following

always
been
delicate
and
with
more
troubles
to
bear
than
she
could
stand
poor
thing
since
her
husband

i
say

a
scamp
even
if
he
is
dead

her
and
the
baby
she
has
took
rooms
with
me
and
done
sewing
and
such
when

again
and
howes
wrote

that

real
nice
child
and
some
like

many
respectfully
yours
sarah
oliver
captain

wiped
his
forehead
well

muttered
well

in
my
life

i
never
did

all
emily
richards
thomas
looked
up
from
the
depths
of

oliver
astonishing
letter

as
he
afterwards
said

him
high
and
dry
with
no
tug
in
mary
thomas
was
dead
and
her
daughter
her
daughter
of
whose
very
existence
he
had
been
ignorant
had
suddenly
appeared
from
nowhere
and
been
dropped
at
his
door
like
an
may
basket
accompanied
by
the
modest
suggestion
that
he
assume
responsibility
for
her
thereafter
no
wonder
the
captain
wiped
his
forehead
in
utter
bewilderment
do
you
think
you
better
send
for
the
box
repeated
the
child
shivering
a
little
under
the
big
coat
hey
what
say
never
mind
though
just
keep
quiet
for
a
spell
you
i
want
to
let
this
soak
in
by
the
big
dipper
of
all
the
solid
brass
cheek
that
ever
i
run
across
this
beats
the
whole
cargo

the

of
what

cold

you
with
all
that
round
you
and
in
front
of
that
fire
no
sir
i
guess
not
only
my
back
feels
sort
of
funny
as
if
somebody
kept
dropping
icicles
down
it
those
bushes
and
vines
were
so
wet
that
when
i
tumbled
down
was
most
like
being
in
a
sho

you
laid
up
on
my
hands
that

be
worse
than

tut
tut

and
blessed
if

not

debby
say
look

the
doctor
the
child
looked
frightened
why
she
cried
her
big
eyes
opening
i
not
sick

i
sick
no
no
course
not
course
not
what
would
you

but
you

to
get
warm
and
dry
right
off
i
and
your
duds
are
all
up
to
the
depot
say
what
does
what
did
your
ma
used
to
do
when
you
felt
er
them
icicles
and
things
she
changed
my
clothes
and
rubbed
me
and
if
i
was
very
wet
she
put
me
to
bed
bed
sure
why
yes
indeed
bed
a
good
place
to
keep
off
icicles
there
my
bedroom
right
in
there
you
could
turn
in
just
as
well
as
not
bunk

but
i

most
sure

mite
babyish
all

you
set
still
till
i
shake
up
that
he
entered
the
chamber
his
own
opening
from
the
sitting
room
and
proceeded
literally
to
shake
up
the
bed
it
was
not
a
lengthy
process
and
when
it
was
completed
he
returned
to
find
his
visitor
already
divested
of
the
coat
and
standing
before
the
stove
i
guess
perhaps
you
have
to
help
undo
me
behind
observed
the
young
lady
this
is
my
best
dress
and
i
ca
reach
the
buttons
in
the
middle
of
the
captain
cy
scratched
his
head
then
he
clumsily
unbuttoned
the
wet
waist
glancing
rather
sheepishly
at
the
window
to
see
if
anyone
was
coming
so
this
is
your
best
dress
hey
he
asked
to
cover
his
confusion
it
was
obviously
not
very
new
for
it
was
neatly
mended
in
one
or
two
places
yes
so
where
you
buy
it
up
to
concord
no
sir
mamma
made
it
a
year
there
was
a
little
choke
in
the
child
voice
the
captain
was
mightily
taken
back
hum
yes
yes
he
muttered
hurriedly
well
there
you
are
now
you
can
get
along
ca
you
yes
sir
shall
i
go
in
that
room
trot
right
in
you
might
er
maybe
you
might
sing
out
when
tucked
up
i
i
want
to
know
if
you
got
bedclothes
emily
disappeared
in
the
bedroom
the
door
closed
captain
cy
his
hands
in
his
pockets
walked
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
sitting
room
the
expression
on
his
face
was
a
queer
one
i
have
got
any
nightgown
called
a
voice
from
the
other
room
the
captain
gasped
good
land
so
you
ai
he
exclaimed
what
in
the
world
humph
i
wonder
he
went
to
the
lower
drawer
of
a
tall
highboy
and
from
the
tumbled
mass
of
apparel
therein
took
one
of
his
own
night
garments
here
one
he
said
coming
back
with
it
in
his
hand
i
guess
have
to
make
this
do
for
now
it
fit
you
enough
for
three
times
to
once
but
it
all
i
a
small
hand
reached
the
edge
of
the
door
and
the
nightshirt
disappeared
captain
cy
chuckled
and
resumed
his
pacing
i
tucked
up
called
miss
thomas
the
captain
entered
and
found
her
in
bed
the
patchwork
points
and
diamonds
of
the
rising
sun
quilt
covering
her
to
the
chin
and
her
head
denting
the
uppermost
of
the
two
big
pillows
captain
cy
liked
to
sleep
got
enough
over
you
he
asked
yes
sir
thank
that
good
i
take
your
togs
out
and
dry
in
the
kitchen
be
scared
i
be
right
in
the
kitchen
he
sorted
the
wet
garments
and
hung
them
about
the
cook
stove
it
was
a
strange
occupation
for
him
and
he
shook
his
head
whimsically
as
he
completed
it
then
he
took
a
flat
iron
one
of
beasley
purchases
from
the
shelf
in
the
closet
and
put
it
in
the
oven
to
heat
soon
afterwards
he
returned
to
the
bedroom
bearing
the
iron
wrapped
in
a
dish
towel
my
ma
always
used
to
put
a
hot
flat
to
my
feet
when
i
was
a
young
one
and
got
chilled
he
explained
i
ai
used
one
for
some
time
but
i
guess
it
a
good
receipt
how
do
you
feel
now
any
more
icicles
no
sir
i
ever
so
warm
is
this
a
nice
bed
think
so
do
you
glad
of
it
well
now
i
goin
to
leave
you
in
it
while
i
step
down
street
and
see
about
havin
your
box
sent
for
i
be
back
in
a
shake
if
anybody
comes
to
the
door
while
i
gone
do
you
worry
let
go
away
he
put
on
his
hat
and
left
the
house
walking
rapidly
his
head
down
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
at
times
he
would
pause
in
his
walk
whistle
shake
his
head
and
go
on
once
more
josiah
dimick
met
him
and
his
answers
to
josiah
questions
were
so
vague
and
irrelevant
that
captain
dimick
was
puzzled
and
later
expressed
the
opinion
that
whit
must
be
pretty
bad
acted
to
me
as
if
he
had
dyspepsy
of
the
captain
cy
stopped
at
lumley
residence
to
leave
an
order
for
the
delivery
of
the
box
then
he
drifted
into
simmons
and
accosted
alpheus
smalley
al
he
said
what
good
for
a
cold
why
asked
smalley
in
true
yankee
fashion
you
got
one
hey
oh
yes
yes
i
got
by
way
of
proof
he
coughed
until
the
lamp
chimneys
rattled
on
the
shelf
judas
i
should
think
you
had
well
there
bark
oil
and
elixir
and
two
kinds
of
that
good
for
most
everything
and
is
your
throat
sore
hey
yes
i
guess
do
you
know
if
you
got
sore
throat
there
ai
nothin
balsam
but
what
in
time
are
you
doin
out
in
this
drizzle
with
a
cold
and
no
umbrella
do
you
want
to
never
mind
my
umbrella
i
left
it
in
the
church
entry
sunday
and
somebody
got
out
afore
i
did
this
balsam
seems
to
me
i
remember
my
ma
usin
that
on
me
wet
a
rag
with
it
do
you
and
tie
it
round
your
neck
yup
be
sure
and
use
a
flannel
rag
and
red
flannel
if
you
got
it
that
acts
the
other
kinds
fifteen
cent
bottle
i
guess
so
might
well
give
me
some
while
you
about
it
always
handy
to
have
in
the
house
and
er
say
is
that
canned
soup
you
got
up
on
that
shelf
the
astonished
clerk
admitted
that
it
was
well
give
me
a
can
of
the
chicken
smalley
standing
on
a
chair
to
reach
the
shelf
where
the
soup
was
kept
shook
his
head
now
that
too
bad
he
said
but
we
all
out
of
chicken
just
now
fact
is
we
ai
got
nothin
but
termatter
and
beef
broth
yes
and
i
declare
if
the
termatter

all
humph
then
i
guess
i
take
the
beef
need
mind
wrappin
it
up
so
he
departed
bearing
his
purchases
when
simmons
proprietor
of
the
store
returned
alpheus
told
him
that
he
captain
cy
whittaker
was
preparing
to
go
into
a
decline
or
anyhow
said
alpheus
he
bought
and
balsam
and
i
sold
him
a
can
of
that
beef
soup
you
bought
three
year
ago
last
summer
when
alicia
atkins
had
the
chicken
the
captain
entered
the
house
quietly
and
tiptoed
to
the
door
of
the
bedroom
emily
was
asleep
and
the
sight
of
the
childish
head
upon
the
pillow
gave
him
a
start
as
he
peeped
in
at
it
it
looked
so
natural
almost
as
if
it
belonged
there
it
had
been
in
a
bed
like
that
and
in
that
very
room
that
he
had
slept
when
a
boy
gabe
brimful
of
curiosity
brought
the
box
a
little
later
his
curiosity
was
ungratified
captain
cyrus
explaining
that
it
was
a
package
he
had
been
expecting
the
captain
took
the
box
to
the
bedroom
and
finding
the
child
still
asleep
deposited
it
on
the
floor
and
tiptoed
out
again
he
went
to
the
kitchen
poked
up
the
fire
and
set
about
getting
dinner
he
was
warming
the
beef
broth
in
a
saucepan
on
the
stove
when
emily
appeared
she
was
dressed
in
dry
clothes
from
the
box
and
seemed
to
be
feeling
as
good
as
new
hello
exclaimed
captain
cy
you
on
deck
again
hey
icicles
all
gone
was
the
reply
do
you
do
your
own
work
ca
i
help
i
can
set
the
table
i
used
to
for
the
captain
protested
that
he
could
do
it
himself
just
as
well
but
the
girl
persisting
he
showed
her
where
the
dishes
were
kept
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
watched
her
as
she
unfolded
the
tablecloth
is
this
the
only
one
you
got
she
inquired
it
awful
hum
yes
i
ai
tended
up
to
my
washin
and
ironin
the
way
i
ought
to
i
lose
my
job
if
i
do
look
out
hey
before
they
sat
down
to
the
meal
captain
cy
insisted
that
his
guest
take
a
tablespoonful
of
the
sarsaparilla
and
decorate
her
throat
with
a
section
of
red
flannel
soaked
in
the
balsam
the
perfume
of
the
latter
was
penetrating
and
might
have
interfered
with
a
less
healthy
appetite
than
that
of
miss
thomas
have
some
soup
some
i
bought
purpose
for
you
best
thing
goin
for
folks
with
icicles
remarked
the
captain
waving
the
iron
spoon
he
had
used
to
stir
the
contents
of
the
saucepan
yes
sir
thank
you
but
do
you
ask
a
blessing
hey
a
blessing
you
know
saying
that
you
thankful
for
the
food
now
set
before
hum
why
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
kind
of
neglected
that
afraid
bein
thankful
for
the
grub
i
had
lately
was
most
too
much
of
a
strain
i
should
i
know
the
one
mamma
used
to
say
shall
i
ask
it
for
you
sho
i
guess
so
if
you
want
the
girl
bent
her
head
and
repeated
a
short
grace
captain
cy
watched
her
curiously
now
i
have
some
soup
please
observed
emily
i
awful
hungry
i
had
breakfast
at
five
this
morning
and
we
did
have
a
chance
to
eat
a
good
many
times
that
day
the
captain
caught
himself
wondering
if
he
was
dreaming
the
whole
affair
seemed
too
ridiculous
to
be
an
actual
experience
dinner
over
he
and
emmie
attended
to
the
dishes
he
washing
and
she
wiping
and
even
at
this
early
stage
of
their
acquaintance
her
disposition
to
take
charge
of
things
was
apparent
she
found
fault
with
the
dish
towels
they
were
almost
as
bad
as
the
tablecloth
she
said
considering
that
the
same
set
had
been
in
use
since
departure
the
criticism
was
not
altogether
baseless
but
the
young
lady
did
not
stop
there
her
companion
skill
as
a
washer
was
questioned
excuse
me
she
said
but
do
you
think
that
plate
had
better
be
done
over
i
guess
you
did
see
that
place
in
the
corner
perhaps
you
forgot
your
specs
auntie
oliver
could
see
well
without
her
captain
cy
grinned
and
admitted
that
a
second
washing
would
hurt
the
plate
i
guess
your
auntie
was
one
of
the
particular
kind
he
said
no
sir
was
mamma
she
could
bear
dirty
things
auntie
used
to
say
that
mamma
hunted
dust
with
a
magnifying
glass
she
did
though
she
only
liked
to
be
neat
i
guess
dust
does
worry
men
so
much
as
it
does
why
oh
there
so
much
of
it
here
do
you
think
so
i
help
you
clean
up
by
and
by
if
you
want
you
will
yes
sir
i
used
to
dust
sometimes
when
mamma
was
out
sewing
and
once
i
swept
but
i
did
it
so
hard
that
auntie
would
let
me
any
more
she
said
was
like
trying
to
blow
out
a
match
with
a
later
on
he
found
her
standing
in
the
sitting
room
critically
inspecting
the
mats
the
furniture
and
the
pictures
on
the
walls
he
stood
watching
her
for
a
moment
and
then
asked
well
what
are
you
lookin
for
more
dust
be
hard
to
find
it
thou
art
and
unto
dust
thou
shalt
return
every
time
i
go
outdoor
and
come
in
again
i
realize
how
true
that
emily
shook
her
head
no
sir
she
said
i
was
only
looking
at
things
and
thinkin
hey
what
about
or
is
that
a
secret
no
sir
i
was
thinking
that
this
room
was
different
from
any
i
ever
humph
yes
i
presume
likely
is
do
like
it
very
much
do
you
yes
sir
i
think
i
do
it
got
a
good
many
things
in
it
that
i
never
saw
before
but
i
guess
they
pretty
after
you
get
used
to
captain
cy
laughed
aloud
after
you
get
used
to
hey
he
repeated
yes
sir
that
what
mamma
said
about
auntie
oliver
new
bonnet
that
she
made
herself
i
i
was
thinking
that
you
must
be
peculiar
yes
sir
i
like
peculiar
people
i
peculiar
myself
auntie
used
to
say
i
was
the
most
peculiar
child
she
ever
saw
that
why
i
came
to
you
god
meant
for
peculiar
ones
to
live
together
do
you
think
maybe
that
was
it
and
the
captain
having
no
answer
ready
said
nothing
that
evening
when
asaph
and
bailey
coming
for
their
usual
call
peeped
in
at
the
window
they
were
astounded
by
the
tableau
in
the
whittaker
sitting
room
captain
cy
was
seated
in
the
rocking
chair
which
had
been
his
grandfather
at
his
feet
on
the
walnut
cricket
with
a
haircloth
top
sat
a
little
girl
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
tattered
magazine
a
godey
lady
book
a
pile
of
these
magazines
was
beside
her
on
the
floor
the
captain
was
smiling
and
looking
over
her
shoulder
the
cat
was
curled
up
in
another
chair
the
room
looked
more
homelike
than
it
had
since
its
owner
returned
to
it
the
friends
entered
without
knocking
captain
cy
looked
up
saw
them
and
appeared
embarrassed
hello
boys
he
said
glad
to
see
you
come
right
in
clearin
off
fine
ai
it
tidditt
replied
absently
that
he
would
be
surprised
if
it
was
bailey
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
occupant
of
the
cricket
said
nothing
we
we
did
know
you
had
company
whit
said
asaph
we
been
up
to
simmons
and
alpheus
said
you
was
thin
and
peaked
and
looked
sick
said
you
bought
and
all
kind
of
truck
he
was
afraid
you
had
fever
and
was
out
of
your
head
cruisin
round
in
the
rain
with
no
umbrella
the
gang

talkin
of

and
bailey
thought

had
to
live

that
soup

sold
me
i
be
i
am
now
you
tell
him
that
canned
hot
water
is
all
right
if
you
like
it
but
it
seems
a
shame
to
put
mud
in
it
it
only
changes
the
color
and
do
help
the
bangs
who
was
still
staring
at
emily
now
ventured
a
remark
is
that

relation

he
asked
that
oh

thomas
ca

the
child
rose
laid
down
the
magazine
which
was
open
at
the
colored
picture
of
a
group
of
ladies
in
crinoline
and
chignons
and
going
across
the
room
extended
a
hand
to
tidditt

said

the
captain
with
conviction

the
balsam
ma
always
cured
me
with
it
and
nothin
but
what
in
time
began
bailey
captain
cy
glanced
at
the
child
and
then
at
the
clock
do
you
think
you
better
turn
in
now
emmie
he
said
hastily
cutting
off
the
remainder
of
the
bangs
query
it
after
eight
and
when
i
was
little
i
was
abed
afore
emily
obediently
turned
gathered
up
the
lady
books
and
replaced
them
in
the
closet
then
she
went
to
the
dining
room
and
came
back
with
a
hand
lamp
good
night
she
said
addressing
the
visitors
then
coming
close
to
the
captain
she
put
her
face
up
for
a
kiss
good
night
she
said
to
him
adding
i
like
it
here
ever
so
much
awful
glad
you
let
me
as
bailey
told
asaph
afterwards
captain
cy
blushed
until
the
ends
of
the
red
lapped
over
at
the
nape
of
his
neck
however
he
bent
and
kissed
the
rosy
lips
and
then
quickly
brushed
his
own
with
his
hand
yes
yes
he
stammered
well
er
good
night
pleasant
dreams
to
you
see
you
in
the
the
girl
paused
at
the
chamber
door
you
wo
have
to
unbutton
my
waist
now
she
said
this
is
my
other
one
and
it
ai
that
the
door
closed
the
captain
without
looking
at
his
friends
led
the
way
to
the
dining
room
come
on
out
here
he
whispered
we
can
talk
better
naturally
they
wanted
to
know
all
about
the
girl
who
she
was
and
where
she
came
from
captain
cy
told
as
much
of
the
history
of
the
affair
as
he
thought
necessary
poor
young
one
he
concluded
she
landed
on
to
me
in
the
rain
soppin
wet
and
sick
i
could
turn
her
out
then
nobody
could
course
it
an
everlastin
outrage
on
me
and
the
cheekiest
thing
ever
i
heard
of
but
what
could
i
do
i
was
fixed
a
good
deal
like
an
english
feller
by
the
name
of
gatenby
that
i
used
to
know
in
south
america
he
woke
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
found
a
boa
constrictor
curled
on
the
foot
of
his
bed
next
day
when
a
crowd
of
us
happened
in
there
was
gatenby
white
as
a
sheet
starin
down
at
the
snake
and
it
sound
asleep
did
invite
him
he
says
he
looked
so
i
the
to
disturb
same
way
with
me
the
child
seemed
so
here
i
ai
had
the
heart
to
disturb
her
but
she
said
she
was
goin
to
stay
put
in
bailey
you
ai
goin
to
keep
her
are
you
the
captain
indignation
was
intense
who
me
he
snorted
what
do
you
think
i
am
i
ai
runnin
an
orphan
asylum
no
sir
i
keep
the
young
one
a
day
or
so
or
maybe
a
week
and
then
i
pack
her
off
to
betsy
howes
i
ai
so
soft
as
they
think
i
am
i
show
tidditt
looked
thoughtful
she
a
kind
of
cute
little
girl
ai
she
he
observed
captain
cy
frown
vanished
and
a
smile
took
its
place
that
so
he
chuckled
she
is
now
that
a
fact
i
do
know
i
ever
saw
a
chapter
vii
captain
cy
proves
delinquent
a
week
is
a
very
long
time
even
in
bayport
true
there
was
once
a
drummer
for
a
boston
notion
house
who
sprained
his
ankle
on
the
icy
sidewalk
in
front
of
simmons
and
was
therefore
obliged
to
remain
in
the
front
bedroom
of
the
perfect
boarding
house
for
seven
whole
days
he
is
quoted
as
saying
that
next
time
he
hoped
he
might
break
his
neck
brother
asked
the
shocked
rev
daniels
who
was
calling
upon
the
stranger
are
you
prepared
to
face
eternity
what
was
the
energetic
reply
after
a
week
in
this
town
and
in
this
bedroom
look
here
mister
if
you
want
to
scare
me
about
the
future
you
just
hint
that
they
put
me
on
a
straw
tick
in
an
ice
chest
anything
hot
and
lively
only
be
tempting
after
but
to
us
who
live
here
throughout
the
year
a
week
soon
passes
and
the
end
of
the
week
following
emily
thomas
arrival
at
the
cy
whittaker
place
found
the
little
girl
still
there
and
apparently
no
nearer
being
shipped
to
indiana
than
when
she
came
not
so
near
if
opinion
counts
for
anything
gone
he
repeated
scoffingly
in
reply
to
bailey
bangs
question
course
she
ai
gone
and
what
more
she
ai
goin
to
go
got
so
already
that
he
would
part
with
her
no
he
cut
off
his
but
he
keeps
sayin
she
got
to
go
only
yesterday
he
was
tellin
how
betsy
feel
when
the
girl
landed
on
her
with
his
letter
in
her
sayin
do
count
for
nothin
zoeth
cahoon
keeps
sayin
he
goin
to
stop
drinkin
but
he
only
stops
long
enough
to
catch
his
breath
tellin
himself
fairy
yarns
and
he
hopes
he
believes
man
alive
ca
you
see
ai
he
gettin
more
foolish
over
the
young
one
every
day
do
she
boss
him
round
like
the
overseer
on
a
cranberry
swamp
do
he
look
more
contented
than
he
has
sence
he
got
off
the
cars
i
tell
you
bailey
that
child
fills
a
place
in
whit
life
that
been
runnin
to
seed
and
needed
weedin
nothin
could
fill
it
better
unless
a
nice
wife
oh
do
be
still
i
believe
you
and
at
an
age
when
it
had
ought
to
be
catchin
no
whoopin
bangs
and
the
town
clerk
were
the
only
ones
except
captain
cy
who
knew
the
whole
truth
concerning
the
little
girl
not
that
the
arrival
was
noted
and
vigorously
discussed
by
a
large
portion
of
the
townspeople
emily
had
not
been
in
the
whittaker
house
two
days
before
angeline
phinney
called
hot
on
the
trail
of
gossip
and
sensation
but
persistent
as
angeline
was
she
departed
knowing
not
quite
as
much
as
when
she
came
the
interview
between
miss
phinney
and
the
captain
must
have
been
interesting
judging
by
the
lady
account
of
it
i
never
see
such
a
man
in
my
born
days
declared
angie
disgustedly
you
could
get
nothin
out
of
him
not
that
he
wa
pleasant
and
sociable
land
sakes
he
acted
as
glad
to
see
me
as
if
i
was
his
rich
aunt
come
on
a
visit
and
he
was
willin
to
talk
too
that
the
trouble
he
done
all
the
talkin
i
happened
to
mention
just
as
a
sort
of
starter
you
know
somethin
about
the
crop
this
fall
and
after
that
all
he
could
say
was
you
got
says
i
you
says
he
ai
it
strange
how
things
get
spread
around
only
yesterday
i
heard
that
joe
dimick
swamp
was
just
loaded
down
with
early
and
yet
when
i
went
over
to
look
at
it
there
did
seem
to
be
so
many
there
much
better
anywhere
than
our
early
blacks
he
says
take
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
so
on
did
care
about
the
dratted
early
blacks
but
he
did
seem
to
care
for
else
he
talked
steady
for
an
hour
and
a
half
and
i
left
that
house
with
my
mouth
all
puckered
up
it
tasted
sour
ever
sence
i
never
see
such
a
man
when
captain
cy
was
questioned
by
asaph
concerning
the
acid
conversation
he
grinned
i
did
know
you
was
so
interested
in
observed
tidditt
i
ai
was
the
reply
but
i
more
interested
in
than
i
am
in
angie
i
see
she
was
sufferin
from
a
rush
of
curiosity
to
the
head
and
i
cured
her
by
homeopath
doses
every
time
she
opened
her
mouth
i
dropped
an
black
into
it
it
a
good
receipt
you
tell
bailey
to
try
it
on
ketury
some
to
his
chums
the
captain
was
emphatic
in
his
orders
that
secrecy
be
preserved
no
one
was
to
be
told
who
the
child
was
or
where
she
came
from
what
they
do
know
wo
hurt
any
declared
captain
cy
and
emily
answer
to
inquiring
souls
who
would
fain
have
delved
into
her
past
was
to
the
effect
that
uncle
cyrus
did
like
to
have
her
talk
about
herself
i
do
know
i
ashamed
of
anything
i
done
so
far
said
the
captain
but
i
ai
braggin
either
time
enough
to
talk
when
i
send
her
back
to
that
time
apparently
was
not
in
the
near
future
the
girl
stayed
on
at
the
whittaker
place
and
grew
to
be
more
and
more
a
part
of
it
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
captain
cy
began
calling
her
a
a
mighty
handy
man
aboard
ship
he
explained
and
so
handy
here
that
it
fits
in
first
rate
and
besides
it
sounds
so
natural
my
dad
called
me
when
i
was
emily
accepted
the
title
complacently
she
was
quite
contented
to
be
called
almost
anything
so
long
as
she
was
permitted
to
stay
with
her
new
friend
already
the
had
taken
charge
of
the
deck
and
the
rest
of
the
ship
company
captain
cy
and
lonesome
the
cat
obeyed
her
orders
on
the
second
sunday
morning
after
her
arrival
suggested
that
she
and
captain
cy
go
to
church
mother
and
i
always
went
at
home
she
said
and
auntie
oliver
used
to
say
meeting
was
a
good
thing
for
those
that
needed
think
i
need
it
do
you
asked
the
captain
who
in
shirt
sleeves
and
slippers
had
prepared
for
a
quiet
forenoon
with
his
pipe
and
the
boston
transcript
i
do
know
sir
i
heard
what
you
said
when
lonesome
ate
up
the
steak
and
i
thought
maybe
you
had
been
for
a
long
time
i
guess
churches
are
different
in
south
so
they
went
to
church
and
sat
in
the
old
whittaker
pew
the
captain
had
been
there
once
before
when
he
first
returned
to
bayport
but
the
sermon
was
more
somnolent
than
edifying
and
he
had
repeated
the
experiment
the
pair
attracted
much
attention
fragments
of
a
conversation
heard
by
captain
cy
as
they
emerged
into
the
vestibule
had
momentous
consequences
kind
of
a
pretty
child
ai
she
commented
eben
salters
patting
her
false
front
into
place
under
the
eaves
of
her
sunday
bonnet
pretty
enough
in
the
face
sniffed
tad
simpson
who
was
wearing
her
black
silk
for
the
first
time
since
its
third
pretty
enough
that
way
i
but
my
land
look
at
the
way
rigged
old
dress
darned
and
patched
up
and
all
outgrown
if
i
had
cy
whittaker
money
i
be
ashamed
to
have
a
relation
of
mine
come
to
meetin
that
way
even
if
her
folks
was
job
off
ox
i
spend
a
little
on
my
own
account
and
trust
to
getting
it
back
some
time
have
more
care
for
my
own
look
at
alicia
atkins
see
how
nice
she
looks
them
feathers
on
her
hat
must
have
cost
somethin
i
bet
you
howdy
do
dear
when
your
pa
comin
home
the
honorable
heman
had
left
town
on
a
business
trip
to
the
south
alicia
was
accompanied
by
the
atkins
housekeeper
and
as
usual
was
garbed
regardless
of
expense
salters
smiled
sweetly
upon
the
atkins
heir
and
then
added
in
a
church
whisper
do
she
look
sweet
i
agree
with
you
sarah
it
is
strange
how
captain
whittaker
lets
his
little
niece
go
and
him
rich
niece
repeated
simpson
eagerly
who
said
was
his
niece
i
heard
was
a
child
he
adopted
out
of
a
home
there
all
sorts
of
queer
yarns
about
i
oh
good
mornin
cyrus
how
do
you
do
the
captain
grunted
an
answer
to
the
effect
that
he
was
bearing
up
pretty
well
considering
there
was
a
scowl
on
his
face
and
he
spoke
little
as
holding
emily
by
the
hand
he
led
the
way
home
that
evening
he
dropped
in
at
the
perfect
boarding
house
and
begged
to
know
if
bangs
had
any
fashion
books
around
that
she
did
want
i
mean
er
er
magazines
with
pictures
of
women
duds
in
he
stammered
in
explanation
likes
to
look
at
she
great
on
fashion
books
keturah
got
together
a
half
dozen
numbers
of
the
home
dressmaker
and
other
periodicals
of
a
similar
nature
the
captain
took
them
under
his
arm
and
departed
whispering
to
tidditt
as
he
passed
the
latter
in
the
hall
come
up
by
and
by
ase
i
want
to
talk
to
you
bring
bailey
along
if
you
can
do
it
without
startin
divorce
later
when
the
trio
gathered
in
the
whittaker
sitting
room
captain
cy
produced
the
fashion
books
and
spoke
concerning
them
you
see
he
said
i
i
been
thinkin
that
emily
that
is
wa
rigged
exactly
the
way
she
ought
to
be
have
you
fellers
noticed
it
his
friends
seemed
surprised
neither
was
ready
with
an
immediate
answer
so
the
captain
went
on
course
i
do
mean
she
ai
got
canvas
enough
to
cover
her
spars
he
explained
but
what
she
has
got
has
seen
weather
and
it
seemed
to
me
was
pretty
nigh
time
to
haul
her
into
dry
dock
and
refit
that
why
i
borrowed
these
magazines
of
ketury
i
been
lookin
them
over
and
there
seems
to
be
plenty
of
riggin
for
small
craft
the
only
thing
is
i
do
know
what
the
right
cut
for
her
build
bailey
a
married
man
you
ought
to
know
somethin
about
women
clothes
what
do
you
think
of
this
now
he
opened
one
of
the
magazines
and
pointed
to
the
picture
of
a
young
girl
with
a
waspy
waist
and
lilliputian
feet
who
arrayed
in
flounces
and
furbelows
was
toddling
gingerly
down
a
flight
of
marble
steps
she
carried
a
parasol
in
one
hand
and
the
other
held
the
end
of
a
chain
to
which
a
dog
was
attached
the
town
clerk
and
his
companion
inspected
the
young
lady
with
deliberation
and
interest
well
what
do
you
say
demanded
captain
cy
i
do
care
much
for
them
kind
of
dogs
observed
asaph
thoughtfully
good
land
you
do
they
heave
the
dog
in
with
the
clothes
for
good
measure
do
you
bailey
what
your
opinion
bangs
looked
wise
i
should
say
he
said
yes
sir
i
should
say
that
was
a
real
stylish
only
thing
is
that
girl
is
less
fleshy
than
emily
this
one
looks
to
me
as
if
she
was
breakin
in
two
amidships
still
i
likely
the
duds
do
come
ready
made
so
they
could
be
let
out
some
to
fit
what
the
price
of
a
suit
like
that
whit
the
captain
looked
at
the
printed
number
beneath
the
fashion
plate
and
then
turned
to
the
description
in
the
text
gown
for
miss
of
sixteen
he
read
humph
that
settles
that
first
crack
ai
but
half
of
anyway
put
in
asaph
you
need
somethin
she
could
wear
forenoons
if
she
wanted
to
what
this
one
she
looks
young
the
one
referred
to
turned
out
to
be
a
coat
for
child
of
it
was
therefore
scornfully
rejected
one
after
another
the
different
magazines
were
examined
and
the
pictures
discussed
at
length
a
costume
for
miss

dressmaker

i
hunt
up
effie
and
hunt
her
up
he
did
with
the
result
that
miss
taylor
came
to
the
whittaker
place
each
day
during
the
following
week
and
emily
was
as
the
captain
said
rigged
out
fresh
from
main
truck
to
in
this
rigging
captain
cy
and
his
two
partners
josiah
dimick
had
already
christened
the
pair
the
board
of
strategy
took
a
marked
interest
they
were
on
hand
when
each
new
garment
was
tried
on
and
they
approved
or
criticised
as
seemed
to
them
best
ai
that
kind
of
sober
lookin
for
a
young
one
like
asked
the
captain
referring
to
one
of
the
new
gowns
i
do
want
her
to
look
as
if
she
was
dressed
land
sakes
mumbled
miss
taylor
her
mouth
full
of
pins
there
anything
cheap
about
it
and
you
find
it
out
when
you
get
the
bill
that
a
nice
rich
sensible
i
know
but
it
so
everlastin
quiet
do
you
think
a
little
yellow
and
black
or
some
red
strung
along
the
yards
would
sort
of
liven
it
up
why
you
ought
to
see
them
greaser
girls
down
in
south
america
of
a
sunday
afternoon
color
and
go
jerushy
they
pretty
nigh
knock
your
eye
the
dressmaker
sniffed
disdain
whittaker
she
retorted
if
you
want
this
child
to
look
like
an
indian
squaw
or
a
barber
pole
you
have
to
get
somebody
else
to
do
it
i
used
to
dressing
christians
not
yeller
and
black
heathen
women
red
strung
along
a
skirt
like
that
i
never
did
there
there
effie
do
get
the
barometer
fallin
i
was
only
suggestin
you
know
what
do
you
think
why
uncle
cyrus
i
do
believe
i
should
like
red
very
much
nor
the
other
colors
either
i
like
this
just
as
it
so
well
you
the
doctor
maybe
you
right
i
would
want
you
to
look
like
a
barber
pole
do
love
tad
simpson
enough
to
want
to
advertise
his
miss
taylor
coming
had
other
results
besides
the
refitting
of
she
found
much
fault
with
the
captain
housekeeping
it
developed
that
her
sister
georgiana
who
had
been
working
in
a
brockton
shoe
shop
was
now
at
home
and
might
be
engaged
to
attend
to
the
household
duties
at
the
whittaker
establishment
provided
she
was
allowed
to
go
home
georgiana
was
engaged
on
trial
and
did
well
so
that
problem
was
solved
school
in
bayport
opens
the
first
week
in
october
of
late
there
has
been
a
movement
headed
by
some
of
the
townspeople
who
think
city
ways
are
best
to
have
the
term
begin
in
september
but
this
idea
has
little
chance
of
success
as
long
as
cranberry
picking
continues
to
be
our
leading
industry
so
many
of
the
children
help
out
the
family
means
by
picking
cranberries
in
the
fall
that
school
until
the
picking
season
was
over
would
be
slimly
attended
the
last
week
in
september
found
us
all
discussing
the
coming
of
the
new
downstairs
teacher
miss
phoebe
dawes
since
it
was
definitely
settled
that
she
was
to
come
the
opposition
had
died
down
and
was
less
openly
expressed
but
it
was
there
all
the
same
beneath
the
surface
congressman
atkins
had
accepted
the
surprising
defiance
of
his
wish
with
calm
dignity
and
the
philosophy
of
the
truly
great
who
are
not
troubled
by
trifles
his
lieutenant
tad
simpson
quoted
him
as
saying
that
of
course
the
will
of
the
school
committee
was
paramount
and
he
as
all
good
citizens
should
bowed
to
their
verdict
far
be
it
from
me
so
the
great
man
proclaimed
to
desire
that
my
opinion
should
carry
more
weight
than
that
of
the
humblest
of
my
friends
and
neighbors
speaking
as
one
whose
knowledge
of
the
world
was
perhaps
er
more
extensive
than
er
others
i
favored
the
normal
school
candidate
but
the
persons
chosen
to
select
thought
or
appeared
to
think
otherwise
i
therefore
say
nothing
and
await
this
attitude
was
considered
by
most
of
us
to
reflect
credit
upon
atkins
there
were
a
few
scoffers
however
when
the
proclamation
was
repeated
to
captain
cy
he
smiled
alpheus
he
said
to
smalley
his
informant
you
did
use
to
know
deacon
zeb
clark
who
lived
up
by
the
salt
works
in
my
time
hey
no
course
you
did
well
the
deacon
was
a
great
believer
in
his
own
judgment
one
time
it
bein
saturday
his
wife
wanted
him
to
pump
the
washtub
full
and
take
a
bath
he
said
no
said
the
cistern
was
awful
low
and
use
up
all
the
water
she
said
no
such
thing
there
was
water
to
prove
she
was
wrong
he
went
and
pried
the
cistern
cover
off
to
look
and
fell
in
clark
peeked
down
and
saw
him
there
standin
up
to
his
neck
says
he
would
have
your
way
and
i
takin
the
bath
but
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
we
have
to
cart
water
from
now
on
however
ai
responsible
throw
me
down
the
soap
and
towel
humph
grunted
smalley
i
do
see
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
heman
ai
takin
no
i
do
know
it
got
anything
to
do
with
it
but
he
kind
of
made
me
think
of
zeb
all
the
the
first
day
of
school
was
of
course
a
monday
on
sunday
afternoon
captain
cy
and
went
for
a
walk
these
walks
had
become
a
regular
part
of
the
sabbath
programme
the
weather
of
course
permitting
after
church
the
pair
came
home
for
dinner
the
meal
being
eaten
the
captain
would
light
a
cigar
a
pipe
was
now
hardly
enough
for
sunday
and
taking
his
small
partner
by
the
hand
would
lead
the
way
across
the
fields
through
the
pines
and
down
by
the
meadow
short
cut
to
the
cemetery
the
cemetery
is
a
favorite
sabbath
resort
for
the
natives
of
bayport
who
usually
speak
of
it
as
the
graveyard
it
is
a
pleasant
shady
spot
and
to
visit
it
is
considered
quite
respectable
and
in
keeping
with
the
day
and
a
due
regard
for
decorum
the
ungodly
meaning
the
summer
boarders
and
the
village
seem
to
prefer
the
beach
and
the
fish
houses
but
the
cemetery
attracts
the
churchgoers
one
may
gossip
concerning
the
probable
cost
of
a
new
tombstone
and
still
remain
faithful
to
the
most
rigid
creed
captain
cy
was
not
strictly
speaking
a
religious
man
according
to
bayport
standards
between
his
attendance
to
churchly
duties
and
that
of
the
honorable
heman
atkins
there
was
a
great
gulf
fixed
but
he
rather
liked
to
visit
the
graveyard
on
sunday
afternoons
his
mother
had
been
used
to
stroll
there
with
him
in
his
boyhood
and
it
pleased
him
to
follow
in
her
footsteps
so
he
and
walked
along
the
paths
between
the
lots
of
the
and
the
humble
mounds
and
simple
slabs
where
the
poor
were
sleeping
past
the
sumptuous
granite
shaft
of
the
atkins
lot
and
the
tilted
mossy
stone
which
told
how
edwin
simpson
our
only
son
had
been
accidentally
shot
in
the
west
indies
out
through
the
back
gate
and
up
the
hill
to
the
pine
grove
overlooking
the
bay
here
on
a
scented
carpet
of
pine
needles
they
sat
them
down
to
rest
and
chat
emily
her
small
knees
drawn
up
and
encircled
by
her
arms
looked
out
across
the
flats
now
half
covered
with
the
rising
tide
it
was
a
mild
day
more
like
august
than
october
and
there
was
almost
no
wind
the
sun
was
shining
on
the
shallow
water
and
the
sand
beneath
it
showed
yellow
checkered
and
marbled
with
dark
green
streaks
and
patches
where
the
channels
wound
tortuously
on
the
horizon
the
sand
hills
of
wellmouth
notched
the
blue
sky
the
girl
drew
a
long
breath
oh
she
exclaimed
is
this
just
lovely
i
do
like
the
sea
an
awful
that
natural
enough
replied
her
companion
there
a
big
streak
of
salt
water
in
your
blood
on
your
ma
side
it
pulls
that
kind
of
a
streak
does
there
days
when
i
feel
uneasy
every
minute
and
hanker
for
a
deck
underneath
me
the
settin
room
floor
stays
altogether
too
quiet
on
a
day
like
that
i
like
to
feel
it
heavin
over
a
ground
say
he
said
a
few
minutes
later
i
been
thinkin
about
you
you
been
to
school
have
you
course
i
have
was
the
rather
indignant
answer
i
went
two
years
in
concord
mamma
used
to
help
me
nights
too
i
can
read
almost
all
the
little
words
do
i
help
you
read
your
paper
every
night
sartin
you
do
yes
yes
well
our
school
opens
and
i
been
thinkin
that
maybe
you
better
go
there
a
new
teacher
comin
and
i
hear
she
pretty
do
you
know
why
tidditt
said
you
was
the
one
that
got
her
to
come
here
yes
well
asaph
says
everything
but
his
prayers
still
he
fur
off
this
time
i
i
was
some
responsible
for
her
bein
voted
in
yet
i
do
really
know
anything
about
her
you
see
i
well
never
mind
what
do
you
think
want
to
go
looked
troubled
i
like
to
she
said
course
i
want
to
learn
how
to
read
the
big
words
too
but
i
like
to
stay
at
home
with
you
you
do
hey
sho
sho
well
i
guess
i
can
get
along
between
times
georgiana
there
to
keep
me
straight
and
she
see
to
the
dust
and
the
dishes
i
guess
you
better
go
mornin
and
see
how
you
like
it
the
child
thought
for
a
moment
i
think
you
awful
good
she
said
i
like
you
next
to
mamma
even
better
than
auntie
oliver
i
printed
a
letter
to
her
the
other
day
i
told
her
you
were
better
than
we
expected
and
i
had
decided
to
live
with
you
captain
cy
was
startled
considering
that
only
the
day
before
he
had
repeated
to
bailey
the
declaration
that
the
arrangement
was
but
temporary
and
that
betsy
howes
was
escaping
responsibility
only
for
a
month
or
so
he
scarcely
knew
what
to
say
humph
he
grunted
you
decided
it
have
you
well
we
see
now
you
trot
around
and
have
a
good
time
i
goin
to
have
another
smoke
i
be
here
when
you
get
wandered
off
in
search
of
late
golden
rod
the
captain
smoked
and
meditated
by
and
by
the
puffs
were
less
frequent
and
the
cigar
went
out
it
fell
from
his
fingers
with
his
back
against
a
pine
tree
captain
cy
dozed
peacefully
he
awoke
with
a
jump
something
had
awakened
him
but
he
did
not
know
what
he
blinked
and
gazed
about
him
then
he
heard
a
faint
scream
uncle
screamed
o
o
o
h
uncle
cyrus
help
me
come
quick
the
next
moment
the
captain
was
plunging
through
the
scrub
of
huckleberry
and
bayberry
bushes
bumping
into
pines
and
smashing
the
branches
aside
as
he
ran
in
the
direction
of
the
call
back
of
the
pine
grove
was
a
big
inclosed
pasture
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
its
rear
boundary
was
the
iron
fence
of
the
cemetery
the
other
three
sides
were
marked
by
rail
fences
and
a
stone
wall
as
the
captain
floundered
from
the
grove
and
vaulted
the
rail
fence
he
swore
aloud
by
the
big
dipper
he
groaned
it
that
cussed
heifer
i
forgot
her
keep
dodgin
girl
i
the
pasture
was
tenanted
by
a
red
and
white
cow
belonging
to
sylvanus
cahoon
whether
or
not
the
animal
had
during
her
calfhood
days
been
injured
by
a
woman
is
not
known
possibly
her
behavior
was
due
merely
to
innate
depravity
at
any
rate
she
cherished
a
mortal
hatred
toward
human
beings
of
her
own
sex
with
men
and
boys
she
was
meek
enough
but
no
person
wearing
skirts
and
alone
might
venture
in
that
field
without
being
chased
by
that
cow
what
would
happen
if
the
pursued
one
was
caught
could
only
be
surmised
for
so
far
no
female
had
permitted
herself
to
be
caught
few
would
come
even
so
near
as
the
other
side
of
the
pasture
walls
had
forgotten
the
cow
she
had
gone
from
one
clump
to
another
until
she
had
traversed
nearly
the
length
of
the
field
then
the
vicious
creature
had
appeared
from
behind
a
knoll
in
the
pasture
and
head
down
and
bellowing
wickedly
had
rushed
upon
her
when
the
captain
reached
the
fence
the
little
girl
was
dodging
from
one
dwarf
pine
to
the
next
with
the
cow
in
pursuit
the
pines
were
few
and
was
nearly
at
the
end
of
her
defenses
help
she
screamed
oh
uncle
where
are
you
what
shall
i
do
captain
cy
roared
in
answer
keep
it
up
he
yelled
i
shoot
you
everlastin
critter
i
break
your
back
for
you
the
cow
did
understand
english
it
seemed
even
such
vigorous
english
as
the
captain
was
using
emily
dodged
to
the
last
pine
the
animal
was
close
upon
her
her
rescuer
was
still
far
away
and
then
the
cemetery
gate
opened
and
another
person
entered
the
pasture
a
small
person
a
woman
she
said
nothing
but
picking
up
her
skirts
ran
straight
toward
the
cow
heedless
of
the
latter
reputation
and
vicious
appearance
one
hand
clutched
the
gathered
skirts
in
the
other
she
held
a
book
do
be
scared
dear
she
called
reassuringly
then
to
the
cow
stop
it
go
away
you
wicked
thing
the
animal
heard
the
voice
and
turned
seeing
that
the
newcomer
was
only
a
woman
she
lowered
her
head
and
pawed
the
ground
run
for
the
gate
little
girl
commanded
the
rescuer
run
quick
obeyed
she
made
a
desperate
dash
from
her
pine
across
the
open
space
and
in
another
moment
was
safe
inside
the
cemetery
fence
scat
go
home
ordered
the
lady
advancing
toward
the
cow
and
shaking
the
book
at
her
as
if
the
volume
was
some
sort
of
deadly
weapon
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
go
away
you
need
growl
at
me
not
a
bit
afraid
of
the
growling
was
the
muttered
bellow
with
which
the
cow
was
wont
to
terrorize
her
feminine
victims
but
this
victim
refused
to
be
terrorized
instead
of
screaming
and
running
she
continued
to
advance
brandishing
the
book
and
repeating
her
orders
that
the
creature
go
home
at
once
the
cow
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
before
she
could
decide
whether
to
charge
or
retreat
a
stick
descended
upon
her
back
with
a
whack
that
settled
the
question
captain
cy
had
reached
the
scene
of
battle
then
the
rescuer
courage
seemed
to
desert
her
for
she
ran
back
to
the
cemetery
even
faster
than
she
had
run
from
it
when
the
indignant
captain
having
pursued
and
chastised
the
cow
until
the
stick
was
but
a
splintered
remnant
reached
the
haven
behind
the
iron
fence
he
found
her
soothing
the
frightened
who
was
sobbing
and
hysterical
emily
saw
her
uncle
cyrus
coming
and
rushed
into
his
arms
he
picked
her
up
and
holding
her
with
a
grip
which
testified
to
the
nerve
strain
he
had
been
under
stepped
forward
to
meet
the
stranger
whose
coming
had
been
so
opportune
and
she
was
a
stranger
the
captain
knew
most
of
bayport
inhabitants
by
this
time
or
thought
he
did
but
he
did
not
know
her
she
was
a
small
woman
quietly
dressed
and
her
hair
under
a
neat
black
and
white
hat
was
brown
the
hat
was
now
a
trifle
to
one
side
and
the
hair
was
the
least
bit
disarranged
an
effect
not
at
all
unbecoming
she
was
tucking
in
the
stray
wisps
as
the
captain
with
in
his
arms
came
up
well
puffed
captain
cy
well
i
must
say
that
was
the
slickest
pluckiest
thing
ever
i
saw
anywheres
i
do
know
what
would
i
i
declare
i
do
know
how
to
thank
the
lady
looked
at
him
a
moment
before
replying
then
she
began
to
laugh
a
jolly
laugh
that
was
pleasant
to
hear
do
try
please
she
said
chokingly
it
was
anything
oh
mercy
me
i
all
out
of
breath
you
see
i
had
been
warned
about
that
cow
when
i
started
to
walk
this
afternoon
so
when
i
saw
her
chasing
your
poor
little
girl
here
i
knew
right
away
what
was
the
matter
it
must
have
been
foolish
enough
to
look
at
i
used
to
dogs
and
cats
but
i
have
had
many
pet
cows
i
told
her
to
home
and
to
and
all
sorts
of
things
wonder
i
did
tell
her
to
lie
down
and
the
way
i
shook
that
ridiculous
book
at
her
was
she
laughed
again
and
the
captain
and
joined
in
the
laugh
in
spite
of
the
fright
they
both
had
experienced
that
book
was
dry
enough
to
frighten
almost
anything
continued
the
lady
it
was
one
i
took
from
the
table
before
i
left
the
place
where
i
staying
and
a
duller
collection
of
sermons
i
never
saw
oh
dear
there
is
my
hat
any
more
respectable
now
yes
it
about
on
an
even
keel
i
should
say
but
i
must
tell
you
you
done
simply
great
and
seems
to
me
the
people
who
own
that
cow
must
be
a
poor
set
to
let
her
make
such
a
nuisance
of
herself
did
your
daughter
run
away
from
you
well
you
see
she
ai
really
my
daughter
here
my
nickname
for
her
she
and
i
was
out
walkin
i
set
down
in
the
pines
and
i
guess
i
must
have
dozed
off
anyhow
when
i
woke
up
she
was
gone
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
of
this
scrape
was
hearin
her
the
little
woman
manner
changed
her
gray
eyes
flashed
indignantly
you
dozed
off
she
repeated
with
a
little
girl
in
your
charge
and
in
the
very
next
lot
to
that
cow
did
you
know
the
creature
chased
women
and
girls
why
yes
i
heard
of
it
but
it
was
uncle
cyrus
fault
put
in
eagerly
it
was
mine
i
went
away
by
beyond
shifting
her
gaze
to
the
child
the
lady
paid
no
attention
to
this
remark
what
do
you
think
her
mother
say
when
she
sees
that
dress
she
asked
it
was
emily
best
gown
the
finest
of
the
new
rig
out
prepared
by
miss
taylor
the
girl
and
captain
cy
gazed
ruefully
at
the
rents
and
pitch
stains
made
by
the
vines
and
pine
trees
well
you
see
replied
the
abashed
captain
the
fact
is
she
got
any
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
and
hers
too
poor
dear
well
if
i
were
you
i
should
go
to
sleep
next
time
i
took
her
walking
good
she
turned
and
calmly
walked
down
the
path
at
the
bend
she
spoke
again
i
should
be
gentle
with
her
if
i
were
you
she
said
her
nerves
are
pretty
well
upset
besides
if
you
excuse
my
saying
so
i
do
think
she
is
the
one
that
needs
they
thought
she
had
gone
but
she
turned
once
more
to
add
a
final
suggestion
i
think
that
dress
could
be
fixed
she
said
if
you
took
it
to
some
one
who
knew
about
such
she
disappeared
amidst
the
graveyard
shrubbery
captain
cy
and
slowly
followed
her
from
the
pasture
the
red
and
white
cow
sent
after
them
a
moo
was
highly
indignant
during
the
homeward
walk
she
sputtered
like
a
damp
firecracker
the
idea
of
her
talking
so
to
you
uncle
cyrus
she
exclaimed
it
was
your
fault
at
the
captain
smiled
i
do
know
about
that
shipmate
he
said
i
would
wonder
if
she
was
more
than
half
right
but
say
she
was
all
business
and
no
frills
was
she
ha
ha
how
she
did
spunk
up
to
that
heifer
who
in
the
dickens
do
you
she
is
chapter
viii
the
cow
lady
that
question
was
answered
the
very
next
day
carefully
dressed
by
georgianna
under
the
captain
supervision
and
weighted
down
with
advice
and
counsel
from
the
latter
started
for
the
schoolhouse
at
a
quarter
to
nine
only
a
sense
of
shame
kept
captain
cy
from
walking
to
school
with
her
he
spent
a
miserable
forenoon
they
were
quite
the
longest
three
hours
in
his
varied
experience
the
house
was
dreadfully
lonely
he
wandered
from
kitchen
to
sitting
room
worried
georgianna
woke
up
the
cat
and
made
a
complete
nuisance
of
himself
twelve
found
him
leaning
over
the
gate
and
looking
eagerly
in
the
direction
of
the
schoolhouse
ran
all
the
way
home
she
was
in
a
high
state
of
excitement
what
do
you
think
uncle
cyrus
she
cried
what
do
you
think
found
out
who
the
cow
lady
is
the
cow
lady
oh
yes
yes
have
you
who
is
she
she
teacher
that
who
she
is
the
captain
was
astonished
no
he
exclaimed
phoebe
dawes
you
do
say
so
well
well
yes
sir
when
i
went
into
school
and
found
her
sitting
there
i
was
so
surprised
i
did
know
what
to
do
she
knew
me
too
and
said
good
morning
and
was
i
all
right
again
and
was
my
dress
really
as
bad
as
it
looked
to
be
i
told
her
that
georgianna
thought
she
could
fix
it
and
if
she
could
her
sister
could
she
said
that
was
nice
and
then
time
for
school
to
did
she
say
anything
about
me
inquired
captain
cy
when
they
were
seated
at
the
dinner
table
oh
yes
i
forgot
she
must
have
found
out
who
you
are
she
said
she
was
surprised
that
a
man
who
had
made
his
money
out
of
hides
should
have
been
so
careless
about
the
creatures
that
wore
humph
how
she
get
along
with
the
young
ones
in
school
it
appeared
that
she
had
gotten
along
very
well
with
them
some
of
the
bigger
boys
in
the
back
seats
cherishing
pleasant
memories
of
the
fun
they
had
under
miss
seabury
rule
attempted
to
repeat
their
performances
of
the
previous
term
but
the
very
first
spitball
which
spattered
upon
the
blackboard
proved
a
disastrous
missile
for
its
thrower
she
made
him
clean
the
board
proclaimed
and
awestruck
and
then
he
had
to
stand
in
the
corner
he
was
bennie
edwards
and
he
most
thirteen
miss
seabury
they
said
could
do
anything
with
him
but
teacher
said
as
quiet
as
could
be
and
just
looked
at
him
and
he
went
and
he
most
as
tall
as
she
is
he
did
look
so
silly
the
edwards
youth
was
not
the
only
one
who
was
made
to
look
silly
by
little
miss
dawes
during
the
first
days
of
her
stay
in
bayport
she
dealt
with
the
unruly
members
of
her
classes
as
bravely
as
she
had
faced
the
cahoon
cow
and
the
results
were
just
as
satisfactory
she
was
strict
but
she
was
impartial
and
alicia
atkins
found
to
her
great
surprise
that
the
daughter
of
a
congressman
was
expected
to
study
as
faithfully
and
behave
herself
as
well
as
noah
hamlin
whose
father
peddled
fish
and
whose
everyday
costume
was
a
checkered
jumper
and
patched
overalls
the
school
committee
that
is
the
majority
of
it
was
delighted
with
the
new
teacher
lemuel
myrick
boasted
loudly
of
his
good
judgment
in
voting
for
her
but
tad
simpson
and
darius
ellis
and
others
of
the
atkins
following
still
scoffed
and
hinted
at
trouble
in
the
future
a
new
broom
sweeps
fine
quoted
simpson
she
doin
all
right
now
maybe
anyway
the
young
ones
are
behavin
themselves
but
discipline
ai
the
whole
thing
heman
told
me
that
the
teacher
he
wanted
could
talk
french
language
and
play
music
and
all
kinds
of
accomplishments
phoebe
not
findin
any
fault
with
her
you
understand
do
know
no
more
about
music
than
a
hen
my
wife
says
she
do
even
sing
in
church
loud
enough
for
anybody
to
hear
her
and
as
for
french
why
everybody
knows
she
uses
the
commonest
sort
of
united
states
just
as
easy
to
understand
as
what
i
sayin
miss
dawes
boarded
at
the
perfect
boarding
house
there
opinion
was
divided
concerning
her
bailey
and
tidditt
liked
her
but
the
feminine
boarders
were
not
so
favorably
impressed
i
think
she
altogether
too
pert
about
what
do
concern
her
commented
angeline
phinney
sarah
emma
simpson
dropped
in
day
to
dinner
and
we
church
folks
got
to
talkin
about
the
preachin
such
sermons
and
sarah
emma
told
how
she
heard
he
said
he
known
some
real
moral
universalists
in
his
time
or
some
such
unreligious
foolishness
and
i
said
i
wondered
he
did
get
a
new
tail
coat
the
one
he
preached
in
sundays
was
old
as
the
hills
and
so
outgrown
it
would
scurcely
button
acrost
him
man
bein
paid
nine
hundred
a
year
i
says
to
dress
decent
anyhow
and
that
phoebe
dawes
speaks
up
without
bein
asked
and
says
for
her
part
ruther
hear
a
broad
man
in
a
narrer
coat
than
way
about
was
a
regular
slap
in
the
face
for
me
and
sarah
emma
and
i
ai
got
over
it
captain
cy
heard
the
gossip
concerning
the
new
teacher
and
it
rather
pleased
him
she
appeared
to
be
independent
and
he
liked
independence
he
met
her
once
or
twice
on
the
street
but
she
merely
bowed
and
passed
on
once
he
tried
to
thank
her
again
for
her
part
in
the
cow
episode
but
she
would
not
listen
to
him
was
making
good
progress
with
her
studies
she
was
naturally
a
bright
child
not
the
marvel
the
captain
and
the
board
of
strategy
considered
her
but
quick
to
learn
she
was
not
a
saint
however
and
occasionally
misbehaved
in
school
and
was
punished
for
it
one
afternoon
she
did
not
return
at
her
usual
hour
captain
cy
was
waiting
at
the
gate
when
asaph
tidditt
happened
along
bailey
too
was
with
him
waitin
for
was
you
asked
the
town
clerk
well
you
have
to
wait
quite
a
spell
i
she
been
kept
after
yes
and
she
got
to
write
fifty
lines
of
copy
added
bailey
captain
cy
was
highly
indignant
get
out
he
cried
she
ai
yes
she
has
too
one
of
the
salters
young
ones
told
me
i
knew
be
mad
though
i
folks
that
did
know
her
well
we
do
would
say
she
no
different
from
other
this
was
close
to
heresy
according
to
the
captain
opinion
she
ai
he
cried
i
like
to
know
why
not
if
she
ai
twice
as
smart
as
the
run
of
young
ones
here
then
humph
and
kept
after
school
well
now
i
wo
have
it
there
enough
time
for
studyin
without
wearin
out
her
brains
after
hours
oh
i
guess
no
we
ai
i
tell
you
whit
if
i
was
you
i
make
a
fuss
about
this
she
a
smart
child
is
i
never
see
a
smarter
and
she
ai
any
too
that
so
she
the
idea
that
emily
health
was
delicate
had
become
a
fixed
fact
in
the
minds
of
the
captain
and
the
it
made
a
good
excuse
for
the
systematic
process
of
spoiling
the
girl
which
the
indulgent
three
were
doing
their
best
to
carry
on
i
would
let
her
be
kept
cy
urged
bailey
why
do
you
go
right
off
and
see
phoebe
and
settle
this
thing
you
got
a
right
to
talk
to
her
she
would
be
teacher
if
it
was
for
asaph
added
his
arguments
to
those
of
bangs
captain
cy
carried
away
by
his
firm
belief
that
was
a
paragon
of
all
that
was
brilliant
and
good
finally
yielded
all
right
he
exclaimed
come
on
that
poor
little
thing
sha
be
put
upon
by
the
trio
marched
majestically
down
the
hill
as
they
neared
the
schoolhouse
bailey
courage
began
to
fail
miss
dawes
was
a
boarder
at
his
house
and
he
feared
consequences
should
keturah
learn
of
his
interference
i
i
guess
you
do
need
me
he
stammered
the
three
of
us
scare
that
teacher
woman
most
to
death
and
she
so
little
and
meek
you
know
if
i
should
lose
my
temper
and
rare
up
i
might
say
somethin
that
would
hurt
her
feelin
i
set
on
the
fence
and
wait
for
you
and
ase
tidditt
scornful
comments
concerning
white
feathers
and
backsliders
had
no
effect
bangs
perched
himself
on
the
fence
give
it
to
her
fellers
he
called
after
them
talk
dutch
to
her
let
her
know
that
there
one
child
she
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
asaph
paused
say
cy
he
whispered
do
you
think
i
better
not
go
in
it
really
my
business
you
know
and
and
well
i
on
the
and
she
might
be
frightened
if
she
see
me
pouncin
down
on
her
as
if
i
was
just
a
common
man
i
go
and
set
along
of
bailey
and
you
go
in
and
talk
quiet
to
her
she

so
sort
of
ashamed
if
there
was
anyone
else
to
hear
the
rakin
over
hey
now
see
here
ase
expostulated
the
captain
i
do
like
to
do
this
all
by
myself
besides
was
you
chaps
put
me
up
to
it
you
ai
to
pull
out
of
the
race
and
leave
me
to
go
over
the
course
alone
are
you
come
on
what
are
you
afraid
of
his
companion
hotly
denied
that
he
was
afraid
of
anything
he
had
all
sorts
of
arguments
to
back
his
decision
at
last
captain
cy
lost
patience
well
be
a
skulk
if
you
want
to
he
declared
i
set
out
to
see
this
thing
through
and
i
goin
to
do
it
only
he
muttered
as
he
entered
the
downstairs
vestibule
i
wish
i
did
feel
quite
so
much
as
if
i
was
stealin
hens
miss
dawes
herself
opened
the
door
in
response
to
his
knock
oh
it
you
whittaker
she
said
come
in
captain
cy
entered
the
schoolroom
it
was
empty
save
for
the
teacher
and
himself
and
one
little
girl
who
seated
at
a
desk
was
writing
busily
she
looked
up
and
blushed
a
vivid
red
the
little
girl
was
sit
down
said
miss
phoebe
indicating
the
visitor
chair
what
was
it
you
wanted
to
see
me
about
the
captain
accepted
the
invitation
to
be
seated
but
he
did
not
immediately
reply
to
miss
dawes
question
he
dropped
his
hat
on
the
floor
crossed
his
legs
uncrossed
them
and
then
observed
that
it
was
pretty
summery
weather
for
so
late
in
the
fall
the
teacher
admitted
the
truth
of
his
assertion
and
waited
for
him
to
continue
i
i
school
pretty
full
now
that
over
said
captain
cy
yes
pretty
gettin
along
first
rate
with
the
scholars
i
this
was
a
most
unpromising
beginning
really
no
beginning
at
all
the
captain
cleared
his
throat
set
his
teeth
and
without
looking
at
his
companion
dove
headlong
into
the
business
which
had
brought
him
there
miss
dawes
he
said
i
i
you
know
that
i
mean
emily
there
is
livin
at
my
house
and
that
i
taking
care
of
her
for
for
the
the
lady
smiled
yes
she
said
i
gathered
as
much
from
what
you
said
when
we
first
she
herself
had
said
one
or
two
things
on
that
occasion
captain
cy
remembered
them
distinctly
yes
yes
he
said
hastily
well
my
doin
that
time
was
exactly
the
best
sample
of
the
care
i
will
say
wa
even
a
fair
sample
maybe
i
try
to
do
my
best
with
the
child
long
as
she
stays
with
me
and
er
and
er
i
pretty
particular
about
her
i
glad
to
hear
yes
now
miss
phoebe
i
appreciate
what
you
did
for
and
me
that
sunday
and
i
thankful
for
it
i
tried
to
thank
i
know
please
do
say
any
more
about
it
i
imagine
there
is
something
else
you
want
to
say
is
there
why
yes
there
is
i
i
heard
that
emmie
had
been
kept
after
school
i
did
believe
it
of
course
but
i
thought
i
run
up
and
see
what
he
hesitated
the
teacher
finished
the
sentence
for
him
to
see
if
it
was
true
she
said
it
is
i
told
her
to
stay
and
write
fifty
you
did
well
now
that
what
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
course
i
ai
interferin
in
your
affairs
you
know
but
i
just
wanted
to
explain
about
emmie
i
mean
she
ai
a
common
child
she
got
too
much
head
for
the
rest
of
her
if
you
lived
with
her
same
as
i
have
you
appreciate
it
her
health
is
it
she
seems
strong
enough
to
me
i
have
noticed
any
course
not
else
you
would
have
kept
her
in
but
know
and
i
think
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
never
mind
if
she
ca
do
quite
so
much
writin
i
rather
she
would
she
might
bust
a
blood
vessel
or
somethin
such
things
have
happened
to
extry
smart
young
ones
you
just
let
her
trot
along
home
with
me
now
and
whittaker
miss
dawes
had
risen
to
her
feet
with
a
determined
expression
on
her
face
yes
said
the
captain
rising
also
whittaker
repeated
the
teacher
i
very
glad
that
you
called
i
been
rather
expecting
you
might
because
of
certain
things
i
have
you
heard
what
was
it
you
heard
if
you
do
mind
my
askin
no
i
do
because
i
think
we
must
have
an
understanding
about
emily
i
have
heard
that
you
allow
her
to
do
as
she
pleases
at
home
in
other
words
that
you
are
spoiling
her
and
spoilin
her
spoilin
her
who
told
you
such
an
unlikely
yarn
as
that
i
ai
the
kind
to
spoil
anybody
why
i
so
strict
that
ashamed
of
myself
he
honestly
believed
he
was
miss
phoebe
calmly
continued
of
course
what
you
do
at
home
is
none
of
my
business
i
mention
it
anyhow
if
you
had
called
because
i
pay
very
little
attention
to
town
talk
having
lived
in
this
county
all
my
life
and
knowing
what
gossip
amounts
to
i
like
emily
she
a
pretty
good
little
girl
and
well
behaved
as
children
go
but
this
you
must
understand
she
ca
be
spoiled
here
she
whispered
this
afternoon
twice
she
has
been
warned
often
and
knows
the
rule
i
kept
her
after
school
because
she
broke
that
rule
and
if
she
breaks
it
again
she
will
be
punished
again
i
kept
the
edwards
boy
two
hours
yesterday
and
edwards
boy
do
you
mean
to
compare
that
that
young
rip
of
a
ben
edwards
with
a
girl
like
i
never
heard
i
not
comparing
anybody
i
trying
to
be
fair
to
every
scholar
in
this
room
and
so
long
as
emily
behaves
herself
she
shall
be
treated
accordingly
when
she
does
she
shall
be
punished
you
must
understand
but
ben
edwards
why
he
a
same
as
his
dad
was
a
fore
him
and
emmie
the
smartest
scholar
in
this
oh
no
she
is
she
a
good
scholar
but
there
are
others
just
as
good
and
even
quicker
to
this
was
piling
one
insult
upon
another
other
children
as
brilliant
as
captain
cy
was
bursting
with
righteous
indignation
well
he
exclaimed
well
for
a
teacher
that
we
called
to
and
that
another
thing
broke
in
miss
dawes
quickly
i
been
told
that
you
whittaker
are
the
one
directly
responsible
for
my
being
chosen
for
this
place
i
do
say
that
you
are
presuming
on
that
but
i
ai
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
but
if
you
are
you
must
that
all
i
did
ask
for
the
position
and
now
that
i
got
it
i
shall
try
to
fill
it
without
regard
to
one
person
more
than
another
emily
stays
here
until
her
lines
are
written
i
do
think
we
need
to
say
any
more
good
she
opened
the
door
captain
cy
picked
up
his
hat
swallowed
hard
and
stepped
across
the
threshold
then
miss
phoebe
added
one
more
remark
she
said
when
you
were
in
command
of
a
ship
did
you
allow
outsiders
to
tell
you
how
to
treat
the
sailors
the
captain
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
he
wanted
to
reply
very
much
but
somehow
he
could
find
a
satisfying
answer
to
that
question
he
said
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
you
been
in
south
america
same
as
i
have
and
seen
the
way
them
young
ones
act
you
the
teacher
smiled
in
spite
of
an
apparent
effort
not
to
perhaps
so
she
said
but
this
is
massachusetts
and
well
emily
is
a
captain
cy
strode
through
the
vestibule
just
before
the
door
closed
behind
him
he
heard
a
stifled
sob
from
poor
the
board
of
strategy
was
waiting
at
the
end
of
the
yard
its
members
were
filled
with
curiosity
did
you
give
it
to
her
good
demanded
asaph
did
you
let
her
understand
we
would
put
up
with
such
cruelizin
where
asked
bangs
their
friend
answers
were
brief
and
tantalizingly
incomplete
he
walked
homeward
at
a
gait
which
caused
plump
little
bailey
to
puff
in
his
efforts
to
keep
up
and
he
would
say
almost
nothing
about
the
interview
in
the
schoolroom
well
said
tidditt
when
they
reached
the
whittaker
gate
i
guess
she
knows
her
place
now
hey
cy
i
she
be
careful
who
she
keeps
after
school
from
now
did
use
no
profane
language
did
you
cy
asked
bailey
i
hope
not
she
might
have
you
took
up
just
out
of
spite
did
she
ask
your
pardon
for
her
actions
no
roared
the
captain
savagely
then
banging
the
gate
behind
him
he
strode
up
the
yard
and
into
the
house
came
home
a
half
hour
later
captain
cy
was
alone
in
the
sitting
room
seated
in
his
favorite
rocker
and
moodily
staring
at
nothing
in
particular
the
girl
gazed
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
climbed
into
his
lap
i
wrote
my
fifty
lines
uncle
cyrus
she
said
teacher
said
i
done
them
very
nicely
the
captain
grunted
uncle
cy
whispered
putting
her
arms
around
his
neck
awful
sorry
i
was
so
bad
who
you
you
could
be
bad
if
you
wanted
to
do
talk
that
way
or

say
somethin
i
had
ought

i
could
be
bad

i
whispered

of
it
that
ai
nothin
when
i
was
a
young
one
in
school
i
used
to
whis
hum
well
anyhow

more
about

rocked
quietly
for
a
time

like
her
ever
so
you
do
go
after
the
way
she
treated
you
poor
little
thing
she
did
treat
me
any
worse
than
she
does
the
other
girls
and
boys
when
they
naughty
and
i
did
know
the
rule
about
well
that
different
comparin
you
with

bennie
edwards
the
idea
and
then
makin
you
cry
she
did
make
me

too
i
heard
the
child
looked
up
at
him
and
then
hid
her
face
in
his
waistcoat
i
was
crying
about
her
she
whispered
it
was
me
the
captain
gasped
good
land
he
muttered
it
just
as
i
expected
she
studied
too
hard
and
it
touchin
her
no
sir
it
is
it
is
truly
i
did
cry
about
you
because
i
like

i
was
so
sorry
to
have
you

and
i
kept
feeling

sort
of
ashamed

of

nodded
vigorously
yes

everything
teacher
said
sounded
so
right
and
what
you
said
did
and
i
like
to
have
you
always
do
hey
hum
captain
cy
did
speak
again
for
some
few
minutes
but
he
held
the
little
girl
very
tight
in
his
arms
at
length
he
drew
a
long
breath
by
the
big
dipper
he
exclaimed
you
a
wonder
you
are
i
would
be
surprised
if
you
grew
up
to
be
a
mind
reader
like
that
feller
in
the
show
we
went
to
at
the
townhall
a
spell
ago
to
tell
you
the
honest
lord
truth
i
been
ashamed
of
myself
ever
since
i
come
out
of
that
schoolhouse
door
when
that
teacher
woman
sprung
that
on
me
about
my
hands
aboard
ship
i
was
set
back
about
forty
fathom
i
never
wanted
to
answer
anybody
so
bad
in
my
life
and
i
could
there
was
anything
to
say
i
i
made
a
fool
of
nodded
again
we
wo
do
so
any
more
will

she
said
you
bet
we
wo
wo
anyhow
you
have
done
and
you
like
teacher
the
captain
stamped
his
foot
no
sir
he
declared
she
may
be
all
right
in
her
way
i
she
is
but
it
too
massachusettsy
a
way
for
me
no
sir
i
do
like
her
and
i
wo
like
her
no
never
she
she
ai
my
kind
of
a
woman
he
added
stubbornly
that
what
the
matter
she
ai
my
kind
of
a
chapter
ix
politics
and
birthdays
town
meeting
was
called
for
the
of
november
with
the
summer
boarders
gone
the
cranberry
picking
finished
state
election
over
school
begun
and
under
way
and
real
winter
not
yet
upon
us
bayport
in
the
late
fall
distinctly
needs
something
to
enliven
it
the
shakespeare
reading
society
and
the
sewing
circle
continue
of
course
to
interest
the
women
folks
there
is
the
usual
every
evening
gathering
at
simmons
and
the
young
people
are
looking
forward
to
the
grand
ball
on
thanksgiving
eve
but
for
the
men
on
week
days
there
is
little
to
do
except
to
putter
about
the
house
banking
its
foundations
with
dry
seaweed
as
a
precaution
against
searching
whitewashing
the
barns
and
outbuildings
or
fixing
things
in
the
vegetable
cellar
where
the
sticks
of
smoked
herring
hang
in
rows
above
the
barrels
of
cabbages
potatoes
and
turnips
the
fish
weirs
most
of
them
are
taken
up
lest
the
ice
which
will
be
driven
into
the
bay
later
on
tear
the
nets
to
pieces
even
the
hens
grow
lazy
and
lay
less
frequently
therefore
away
back
in
the
airly
days
some
board
of
selectmen
arranged
that
town
meeting
should
be
held
during
this
lackadaisical
season
a
town
meeting
and
particularly
a
bayport
town
meeting
where
everything
from
personal
affairs
to
religion
is
likely
to
be
discussed
can
stir
up
excitement
when
nothing
else
can
this
year
there
were
several
questions
to
be
talked
over
and
settled
at
town
meeting
two
selectmen
whose
terms
expired
were
candidates
for
lem
myrick
had
resigned
from
the
school
committee
not
waiting
until
spring
as
he
had
announced
that
he
should
do
then
there
was
the
usual
sentiment
in
favor
of
better
roads
and
the
usual
opposition
to
it
also
there
was
the
hope
of
the
government
appropriation
for
harbor
improvement
tidditt
was
one
of
the
selectmen
whose
terms
expired
in
his
dual
capacity
as
selectman
and
town
clerk
asaph
felt
himself
to
be
a
very
important
personage
to
elect
some
one
else
in
his
place
would
be
he
was
certain
a
calamity
which
would
stagger
the
township
therefore
he
was
a
busy
man
and
made
many
calls
upon
his
fellow
citizens
not
to
influence
their
votes
he
was
careful
to
explain
that
but
just
as
he
said
to
see
how
they
was
gettin
along
and
because
he
thought
of
and
took
a
real
personal
interest
you
understand
in
their
affairs
to
captain
cy
he
came
naturally
for
encouragement
and
help
being
as
was
his
habit
at
such
times
in
a
state
of
gloom
and
hopeless
despair
no
use
whit
he
groaned
no
use
at
all
i
licked
gettin
old
and
they
do
want
me
no
more
i
guess
i
better
get
right
up
afore
the
votin
begins
and
tell
my
health
ai
strong
enough
to
be
town
clerk
no
longer
it
better
to
do
that
than
to
be
licked
you
think
so
sure
thing
replied
his
friend
with
sarcasm
if
i
was
you
i
be
toted
in
on
a
bed
so
they
can
see
you
all
ready
for
the
funeral
might
have
the
doctor
walkin
ahead
wipin
his
eyes
and
the
joyful
undertaker
trottin
along
astern
what
the
particular
disease
got
you
by
the
collar
just
now
facial
paralysis
no
what
made
you
think
of
that
oh
nothin
only
i
heard
you
stopped
in
at
ten
houses
up
to
the
west
end
of
the
town
yesterday
and
talked
three
quarters
of
an
hour
steady
at
everyone
that
would
fit
me
for
the
scrap
heap
inside
of
a
week
and
you
been
goin
it
ever
since
september
nearly
what
does
ail
you
anything
why
no
nothin
special
that
way
only
there
do
seem
to
be
any
enthusiasm
for
me
somehow
i
just
hint
at
my
bein
a
candidate
and
folks
say
indeed
looks
like
rain
do
it
and
that
about
well
that
had
ought
to
surprise
you
if
anybody
came
to
me
and
says
sun
goin
to
rise
mornin
i
should
dance
on
my
hat
and
crow
hallelujahs
enthusiasm
why
ase
you
been
a
candidate
every
two
years
since
noah
got
the
ark
off
the
ways
or
along
there
and
there
ai
been
any
opposition
to
you
yet
except
that
time
when
uncle
stickney
woke
up
in
the
wrong
place
and
hollered
out
of
principle
thinkin
he
was
to
home
with
his
wife
if
i
was
you
i
go
and
take
a
nap
you
read
the
minutes
at
selectmen
meetings
for
another
fifty
year
more
or
less
take
my
word
for
it
as
for
the
school
committee
that
different
i
ai
made
up
my
mind
about
there
had
been
much
discussion
concerning
the
school
committee
who
should
be
chosen
to
replace
myrick
on
the
board
was
the
gravest
question
to
come
before
the
meeting
many
names
had
been
proposed
at
simmons
and
elsewhere
but
some
of
those
named
had
refused
to
run
and
others
had
not
after
further
consideration
seemed
the
proper
persons
for
the
office
in
the
absence
of
atkins
tad
simpson
was
our
leader
in
the
political
arena
but
tad
so
far
had
been
mute
wait
a
while
he
said
there
some
weeks
afore
town
meetin
day
this
is
a
serious
business
we
ca
have
no
more
i
mean
no
unsuitable
man
to
fill
such
an
important
place
as
that
the
welfare
of
our
posterity
he
added
and
we
all
recognized
the
quotation
depends
upon
the
choice
that
to
be
a
choice
was
made
however
on
the
very
next
day
but
one
after
this
declaration
a
candidate
announced
himself
asaph
and
bailey
hurried
to
the
cy
whittaker
place
with
the
news
captain
cy
was
in
the
woodshed
building
a
doll
house
for
just
for
my
own
amusement
he
hastily
explained
somethin
for
her
to
take
along
when
she
goes
out
west
to
tidditt
was
all
smiles
what
do
you
think
cy
he
cried
the
new
school
committee
man
as
good
as
elected
snow
goin
to
take
the
captain
laid
down
his
plane
snow
he
repeated
you
do
say
humph
well
well
yes
sir
exclaimed
bailey
he
come
forward
and
says
it
his
duty
to
do
so
he
humph
his
duty
hey
i
wonder
who
pointed
it
out
to
him
well
i
do
know
but
even
tad
simpson
glad
he
says
that
he
knows
heman
will
be
pleased
with
that
kind
of
a
candidate
and
so
he
wo
have
to
do
any
more
huntin
he
thinks
comin
out
by
himself
this
way
is
a
kind
of
special
yes
yes
i
should
wonder
did
you
ever
notice
how
dead
sure
tad
and
his
kind
are
that
providence
is
workin
with
seems
to
me
be
more
satisfactory
if
we
could
get
a
sight
of
the
other
signature
to
the
what
the
matter
with
you
demanded
asaph
you
ai
findin
fault
with
are
you
ai
he
a
good
man
good
sure
thing
he
good
nobody
can
say
he
is
and
tell
the
no
one
could
truthfully
speak
ill
of
alonzo
snow
that
was
a
fact
he
lived
at
the
lower
end
of
the
village
was
well
to
do
a
leading
cranberry
grower
and
very
prominent
in
the
church
a
mild
easygoing
person
was
mr
snow
with
an
almost
too
keen
fear
of
doing
the
wrong
thing
and
therefore
prone
to
be
guided
by
the
opinion
of
others
he
was
distinctly
not
a
politician
then
what
ails
you
asked
asaph
hotly
why
nothin
maybe
only
i
always
suspicious
when
tad
pats
providence
on
the
back
i
generally
figure
that
i
can
see
through
a
doughnut
when
there
a
light
behind
the
hole
who
is
best
friend
in
this
town
who
does
he
chum
with
most
of
anybody
why
darius
ellis
i
guess
you
know
um
hum
and
darius
is
on
the
committee
why
well
i
heman
atkins
thought
he
be
a
good
feller
to
have
there
but
yes
and
pew
in
church
is
right
under
the
atkins
memorial
window
the
light
from
it
makes
a
kind
of
halo
round
his
bald
head
every
well
what
of
it
heman
nor
nobody
else
could
buy
buy
him
indeed
they
could
but
there
are
some
things
you
get
without
buyin
the
measles
for
instance
and
the
one
that
do
know
he
in
danger
till
the
speckles
break
out
fellers
this
committee
voted
in
phoebe
dawes
by
just
two
votes
to
one
and
one
of
the
two
was
lem
myrick
darius
was
against
her
now
with
tad
and
his
puttin
in
snow
and
heman
atkins
settin
behind
the
screen
workin
his
normal
school
music
box
so
they
can
hear
the
tune
well
phoebe
may
stay
this
term
out
but
how
about
next
hey
why
i
do
know
anyhow
you
down
on
phoebe
as
a
thousand
of
brick
i
do
see
why
you
worry
about
her
after
the
way
she
treated
poor
and
captain
cy
stirred
uneasily
and
kicked
a
chip
across
the
floor
well
he
said
well
i
i
do
know
that
that
is
right
right
and
wrong
wrong
i
seen
bullfights
down
yonder
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
in
the
vague
direction
of
buenos
ayres
and
every
time
my
sympathy
been
with
the
bull
not
that
i
loved
the
critter
for
his
own
sake
but
because
all
greaserdom
was
out
to
down
him
from
what
i
hear
this
phoebe
dawes
for
all
her
pesky
stubbornness
is
teachin
pretty
well
and
anyhow
she
one
little
woman
against
tad
simpson
and
heman
atkins
and
and
tad
special
brand
of
providence
she
deserves
a
fair
shake
and
by
the
big
dipper
she
goin
to
have
it
look
here
you
two
how
would
i
look
on
the
school
committee
you
repeated
the
pair
in
concert
you
yes
me
i
ai
a
solomon
for
wisdom
but
i
i
be
as
near
the
top
of
the
barrel
as
darius
ellis
and
only
one
or
two
layers
under
eben
salters
or
snow
i
a
candidate

but
but
whit
gasped

town

do
know
but
i
can
find
out
you
and
bailey

me
you
course
we
will
but
all
right
there
two
votes
a
hundred
and
odd
more
put
me
in
here
goes
for
politics
and
popularity
i
may
be
president
yet
you
tell
and
say
this
town
meetin
wo
be
dull
whichever
way
the
cat
this
last
was
a
safe
prophecy
all
dullness
disappeared
from
bayport
the
moment
it
became
known
that
captain
cyrus
whittaker
was
out
for
the
school
committee
the
captain
began
his
electioneering
at
once
that
very
afternoon
he
called
upon
three
people
eben
salters
josiah
dimick
and
lemuel
myrick
captain
salters
was
chairman
of
selectmen
as
well
as
chairman
of
the
committee
he
was
a
old
salt
who
had
made
money
in
the
australian
packet
service
he
had
common
sense
independence
and
considerable
influence
in
the
town
next
to
congressman
atkins
he
was
perhaps
our
leading
citizen
and
more
than
all
he
was
not
afraid
when
he
thought
it
necessary
to
oppose
the
great
heman
well
he
said
reflectively
after
listening
to
captain
cy
brief
statement
of
his
candidacy
i
i
stand
in
with
you
cy
i
ai
got
anything
against
but
but
well
consarn
it
maybe
that
the
trouble
maybe
he
so
darned
good
it
makes
me
jealous
anyhow
i
do
what
i
can
for
joe
dimick
laughed
aloud
he
was
an
iconoclast
seldom
went
to
church
and
was
entirely
lacking
in
reverence
also
he
really
liked
the
captain
ho
ho
he
crowed
whit
do
you
realize
that
you
underminin
this
town
constitution
oh
sartin
i
with
you
if
it
only
to
see
the
fur
fly
i
do
love
a
with
lem
myrick
captain
cy
policy
was
different
he
gently
reminded
that
gentleman
of
the
painting
contract
intimated
that
other
favors
might
be
forthcoming
and
then
as
a
clincher
spoke
of
tad
comment
when
myrick
voted
for
phoebe
dawes
of
course
he
added
if
you
think
tad
got
a
right
to
boss
all
hands
and
the
cook
why
i
ai
complainin
only
if
was
a
painter
a
good
trade
and
a
barber
tried
to
dictate
to
me
i
should
bow
down
and
tell
him
to
kick
easy
as
he
could
seems
to
me
i
kick
first
but
i
no
boss
i
must
influence
lemuel
was
indignant
no
barber
runs
me
he
declared
you
stand
up
for
me
when
that
townhall
paintin
to
be
done
and
i
work
hard
for
you
now
whittaker
snow
an
elder
and
all
that
but
i
ca
help
it
anyway
his
place
was
all
fixed
up
a
year
ago
and
i
did
get
the
job
a
feller
has
to
look
after
himself
these
with
these
division
commanders
to
lead
their
forces
into
the
country
and
with
asaph
and
bailey
doing
what
they
could
to
help
captain
cy
campaign
soon
became
worthy
of
respectful
consideration
for
a
while
tad
simpson
scoffed
at
the
opposition
then
he
began
to
work
openly
for
mr
snow
later
he
marshaled
his
trusted
officers
around
the
pool
table
in
the
back
room
of
the
barber
shop
and
confided
to
them
that
it
was
anybody
fight
and
that
he
was
worried
it
past
bein
a
joke
he
said
it
mighty
serious
we
got
to
hustle
we
have
heman
trusted
me
in
this
job
and
if
i
fall
down
it
be
bad
for
me
and
for
you
fellers
too
i
wish
he
was
home
to
run
things
himself
but
he
got
business
down
south
there
some
property
he
owns
or
somethin
and
says
he
ca
leave
but
we
must
win
by
mighty
got
to
so
get
every
vote
you
can
never
mind
how
just
get
captain
cy
was
thoroughly
enjoying
himself
the
struggle
suited
him
to
perfection
he
was
young
in
spite
of
his
years
and
this
tussle
against
odds
reminding
him
of
other
tussles
during
his
first
seasons
in
business
aroused
his
energies
and
as
he
expressed
it
stirred
up
his
vitals
and
made
him
hop
round
like
a
dose
of
killer
he
did
not
however
forget
he
and
she
had
their
walks
and
their
pleasant
evenings
together
in
spite
of
politics
he
took
the
child
into
his
confidence
and
told
her
of
the
daily
gain
or
loss
in
votes
as
if
she
were
his
own
age
she
understood
a
little
of
all
this
and
tried
hard
to
understand
the
rest
preaching
between
times
to
georgianna
how
the
bad
men
were
trying
to
beat
uncle
cyrus
because
he
was
gooder
than
they
but
they
could
everybody
loved
him
georgianna
had
some
doubts
but
she
kept
them
to
herself
among
the
things
in
box
was
a
long
envelope
sealed
with
wax
and
with
a
lawyer
name
printed
in
one
corner
the
captain
opened
it
at
emily
suggestion
and
was
astonished
to
find
that
the
inclosure
was
a
will
dated
some
years
back
in
which
mary
thomas
the
mother
left
to
her
daughter
all
her
personal
property
and
also
the
land
in
orham
massachusetts
which
had
been
willed
to
her
by
her
own
mother
there
was
a
note
with
the
will
in
which
thomas
stated
that
no
one
save
herself
had
known
of
this
land
not
even
her
husband
she
had
not
told
him
because
she
feared
that
like
everything
else
it
would
be
sold
and
the
money
wasted
in
dissipation
he
suspected
something
of
the
sort
she
added
but
he
did
not
find
out
the
secret
although
he
she
had
evidently
scratched
out
what
followed
but
captain
cy
mentally
filled
in
the
blank
with
details
of
abuse
and
cruelty
if
anything
happens
to
me
concluded
the
widow
i
want
the
land
sold
and
the
money
used
for
emily
maintenance
as
long
as
it
the
captain
went
over
to
orham
and
looked
up
the
land
it
was
a
strip
along
the
shore
almost
worthless
and
unsalable
at
present
the
taxes
had
been
regularly
paid
each
year
by
mary
thomas
who
had
sent
money
orders
from
concord
the
represented
by
these
orders
was
not
a
little
never
mind
said
captain
cy
when
he
returned
from
the
orham
trip
your
ancestral
estates
ai
much
now
but
a
menagerie
however
if
this
section
ever
does
get
to
be
the
big
summer
resort
folks
are
prophesying
for
it
you
may
sell
out
to
some
millionaire
and
you
and
me
go
to
europe
meantime
we
try
to
keep
afloat
if
the
harniss
bank
do
spring
a
on
the
day
following
this
conversation
he
took
a
flying
trip
to
ostable
the
county
seat
returning
the
same
evening
and
saying
nothing
to
anyone
about
his
reasons
for
going
nor
what
he
had
done
while
there
birthday
was
the
eighteenth
of
november
the
captain
in
spite
of
the
warmth
of
his
struggle
for
committee
honors
determined
to
have
a
small
celebration
on
the
afternoon
and
evening
of
that
day
it
was
to
be
a
surprise
for
emily
and
after
school
was
over
some
of
her
particular
friends
among
the
scholars
were
to
come
in
there
was
to
be
a
cake
with
eight
candles
on
it
and
a
supper
at
which
ice
cream
lemon
and
vanilla
prepared
by
cahoon
was
to
be
the
principal
feature
also
there
would
be
games
and
all
sorts
of
fun
captain
cy
was
tremendously
interested
in
the
party
he
spent
hours
with
georgianna
and
the
board
of
strategy
preparing
the
list
of
guests
his
cunning
in
ascertaining
from
the
unsuspecting
child
who
among
her
schoolmates
she
would
like
to
invite
was
deep
and
guileful
now
he
would
say
suppose
you
was
goin
to
clear
out
and
leave
this
town
for
a
spell
who
but
uncle
cyrus
eyes
grew
frightened
and
moist
in
a
moment
i
ai
going
am
i
i
do
want
to
no
no
course
you
ai
goin
that
is
not
for
a
long
while
anyhow
with
a
sidelong
look
at
the
members
of
the
board
then
present
but
just
suppose
you
and
me
was
startin
on
that
europe
trip
who
you
want
to
say
to
most
of
all
each
name
given
by
the
child
was
surreptitiously
penciled
by
bailey
on
a
scrap
of
paper
the
list
was
a
long
one
and
when
the
great
afternoon
came
the
whittaker
house
was
crowded
the
supper
was
a
brilliant
success
so
was
the
cake
brought
in
with
candles
ablaze
by
the
grinning
georgianna
beside
the
children
there
were
some
older
people
present
bailey
and
asaph
of
course
and
the
regulars
from
the
perfect
boarding
house
who
had
been
invited
because
it
was
fairly
certain
that
bangs
would
be
allowed
to
attend
if
his
wife
did
not
miss
dawes
had
also
been
asked
at
partiality
but
she
had
declined
toward
the
end
of
the
meal
when
the
hilarity
at
the
long
table
was
at
its
height
an
unexpected
guest
made
his
appearance
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
georgianna
opening
it
was
petrified
to
behold
standing
upon
the
step
no
less
a
personage
than
the
honorable
heman
atkins
supposed
by
most
of
us
to
be
then
somewhere
in
that
wide
stretch
of
territory
vaguely
termed
the
good
evening
all
said
the
illustrious
one
removing
his
silk
hat
and
stepping
into
the
room
what
a
charming
scene
i
trust
i
do
not
georgianna
was
still
speechless
in
which
unwonted
condition
she
was
not
alone
bangs
and
tidditt
being
also
stricken
dumb
but
captain
cy
rose
to
the
occasion
grandly
intrude
he
repeated
not
a
mite
of
it
mighty
glad
to
see
you
heman
here
give
us
your
hat
pull
up
to
the
table
when
did
you
get
back
thought
you
was
in
the
orange
groves
ahem
i
was
yes
i
was
in
that
neighborhood
but
it
is
hard
to
stay
away
from
dear
old
bayport
home
ties
you
know
home
ties
i
came
down
on
the
morning
train
but
i
stopped
over
at
harniss
on
business
and
drove
across
ahem
yes
the
housekeeper
informed
me
that
my
daughter
was
here
and
seeing
the
lights
and
hearing
the
laughter
i
resist
making
this
impromptu
call
i
sure
as
an
old
friend
and
neighbor
cyrus
you
will
pardon
me
alicia
darling
come
and
kiss
darling
alicia
accepted
the
invitation
with
a
rustle
of
silk
and
an
ecstatic
squeal
of
delight
during
this
affecting
scene
asaph
whispered
to
bailey
that
he
heman
had
had
a
distress
signal
from
simpson
to
which
sage
observation
bangs
replied
with
a
vigorous
nod
showing
that
captain
cy
example
had
had
its
effect
in
that
they
no
longer
stood
in
such
awe
of
their
representative
at
washington
however
true
asaph
calculation
might
have
been
atkins
made
no
mention
of
politics
he
was
urbanity
itself
he
drew
up
to
the
table
partook
of
the
ice
cream
and
cake
and
greeted
his
friends
and
neighbors
with
charming
benignity
wa
it
sweet
of
him
to
come
whispered
miss
phinney
to
keturah
and
him
so
nice
and
everyday
and
sociable
and
when
runnin
against
his
friend
as
you
might
keturah
replied
with
a
dubious
shake
of
the
head
i
think
captain
cyrus
is
goin
to
get
into
trouble
she
said
preached
to
bailey
more
a
little
about
keepin
clear
but
he
games
in
room
now
ordered
captain
cy
but
atkins
held
up
his
hand

a
moment
cyrus

said
i
feel
that

this
happy
occasion

duty
and
pleasure
to

his
lemonade

proclaimed
to
wish

the
captain
carried
away
by
enthusiasm
and
off
his
guard
for
once
to
em
began
heman
then
he
paused
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
public
life

at
a
loss
for
words

he
asked
and
his
hand

known
some
everyone
looked
at
captain
cy
then
no
one
observed
atkins
for
the
moment
when
they
did
turn
their
gaze
upon
the
great
man
he
had
sunk
back
in
his
chair
the
glass
of
lemonade
was
upset
upon
the
cloth
before
him
and
he
with
a
very
white
face
was
staring
at
emily
richards
thomas
what
the
matter
heman
asked
the
captain
anxiously
ai
sick

the
congressman
started
oh

said
hurriedly

i
afraid

soiled
your
cloth

awkward
of
me
i
i
really
i
apologize
i
he
wiped
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
captain
cy
laughed
oh
never
mind
the
tablecloth
he
said
i
it
too
soiled
already
to
be
hurt
by
a
bath
even
a
lemon

toast

glasses
now

to
you
drink
hearty
all

give
the
ship
a
good
if
the
heartiness
with
which
they
drank
is
a
criterion
the
good
name
of
the
ship
was
established
then
the
assembly
adjourned
to
the
sitting
room
and
yes
even
the
front
parlor
not
since
the
days
when
that
sacred
apartment
had
been
desecrated
by
the
irreverent
city
boarders
during
the
howes
regime
had
its
walls
echoed
to
such
whoops
and
shouts
of
laughter
the
children
played
post
office
and
copenhagen
and
clap
in
clap
out
while
the
grown
folks
looked
on
ai
they
havin
a
fine
time
cap
gushed
miss
phinney
do
it
make
you
wish
you
was
young
again
angie
replied
captain
cy
solemnly
do
tempt
me
do
if
they
keep
on
playin
that
copenhagen
and
you
stand
right
alongside
of
me
there
no
tellin
what
angeline
declared
that
he
was
turrible
but
she
faced
the
threatened
danger
nevertheless
and
bravely
remained
where
she
was
atkins
went
home
early
in
the
evening
taking
alicia
with
him
he
explained
that
his
long
railroad
journey
had
er
somewhat
fatigued
him
and
though
he
hated
to
leave
such
a
er
delightful
gathering
he
really
felt
that
under
the
circumstances
his
departure
would
be
forgiven
captain
cy
opened
the
door
for
him
and
stood
watching
as
holding
his
daughter
by
the
hand
he
marched
majestically
down
the
path
hum
mused
the
captain
aloud
i
guess
he
has
been
travelin
nights
thought
he
ought
to
be
here
quick
i
should
wonder
he
does
look
tired
that
a
fact
and
kind
of
pale
seemed
to
well
there
now
exclaimed
tripp
who
was
looking
over
his
shoulder
did
you
see
that
no
what
was
it
why
when
he
went
to
open
his
gate
one
of
them
arbor
vity
bushes
he
set
out
this
spring
knocked
his
hat
off
and
he
never
seemed
to
notice
but
went
right
on
if
had
picked
it
up
that
nice
new
hat
would
have
been
layin
there
yet
that
the
most
undignified
thing
ever
i
see
heman
atkins
do
he
must
be
tired
out
poor
man
chapter
x
a
letter
and
a
visitor
whit
asked
asaph
next
day
wa
you
surprised
to
see
heman
last
night
captain
cy
nodded
he
was
once
more
busy
with
the
doll
house
the
construction
of
which
had
progressed
slowly
of
late
owing
to
the
demands
which
the
party
and
politics
made
upon
its
builder
time
yup
he
said
i
sartinly
was
pretty
good
sign
i
should
wonder
looks
as
if
friend
tad
had
found
the
tide
settin
too
strong
against
him
and
had
whistled
for
a
tug
all
right
the
more
scared
the
other
side
get
the
better
for
but
what
in
the
world
made
heman
come
over
and
have
supper
he
never
so
much
as
stepped
foot
in
the
house
afore
did
he
that
the
biggest
conundrum
of
well
i
guess
i
got
the
answer
strikes
me
that
heman
sociableness
is
the
best
sign
yet
heman
a
slick
article
and
when
he
sees
danger
of
losin
the
frostin
on
the
cake
he
takes
care
to
scrape
the
burnt
part
off
the
bottom
i
may
be
school
committeeman
after
town
meetin
he
move
all
creation
to
stop
me
of
course
in
his
quiet
way
but
if
i
do
win
out
he
wants
to
be
in
a
position
to
take
me
one
side
and
tell
me
that
he
glad
of
it
he
felt
all
along
i
was
the
right
feller
for
the
job
and
if
there
anything
he
can
do
to
make
things
easier
for
me
just
call
on
him
that
the
way
i
size
it
up
cy
i
never
see
anybody
like
you
you
dead
set
against
heman
and
have
been
right
along
and
he
never
done
anything
to
you
fur
i
see
he
given
a
lot
to
the
town
and
he
always
been
the
most
man
we
got
joe
dimick
and
two
or
three
more
chronic
growls
have
been
the
only
ones
to
sling
out
hints
against
him
till
you
come
course
i
working
for
you
tooth
and
nail
and
i
will
say
that
you
seem
to
be
gettin
the
votes
some
way
or
other
but
if
heman
should
step
right
out
and
say
citizens
i
behind
tad
simpson
in
this
fight
and
as
a
favor
to
me
and
i
think
it
right
and
best
i
want
snow
elected
well
do
believe
you
have
one
jack
and
a
ten
spot
to
count
for
probably
not
ase
i
presume
likely
not
but
you
take
a
day
off
some
time
and
see
if
you
can
remember
that
heman
ever
stepped
right
out
and
said
things
blame
it
that
just
it
as
for
why
he
riles
me
up
and
makes
me
stubborn
as
a
balky
mule
i
do
know
exactly
all
i
sure
is
that
he
does
maybe
it
i
do
like
the
way
he
wears
his
whiskers
maybe
it
because
he
so
and
condescendin
a
feller
can
whistle
to
me
and
say
on
bill
and
i
trot
at
his
heels
all
day
but
when
he
pats
me
on
the
head
and
says
there
nice
doggie
go
under
the
bed
and
lay
down
my
back
bristles
up
and
i
commence
to
growl
right
off
there
whittaker
in
me
as
i
told
you
the
town
clerk
pondered
over
this
rather
unsatisfactory
line
of
reasoning
for
some
minutes
his
companion
fitted
a
wooden
chimney
on
the
doll
house
found
it
a
trifle
out
of
plumb
and
proceeded
to
whittle
a
shaving
off
the
lower
edge
then
asaph
sighed
as
one
who
gives
up
a
perplexing
riddle
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
bundle
of
papers
i
made
out
a
list
of
fellers
down
to
the
that
i
goin
to
see
this
afternoon
he
said
some
of
i
guess
vote
for
you
but
most
of
are
pretty
sartin
for
however
i
where
is
that
list
i
had
it
somewhere
and
well
i
swan
i
come
pretty
near
forgettin
it
myself
i
as
bad
as
from
the
bundle
of
papers
he
produced
a
crumpled
envelope
that
bailey
he
observed
must
be
in
love
i
though
i
know
who
with
ketury
i
to
law
and
order
but
well
anyhow
he
gettin
more
all
the
time
here
a
letter
for
you
cy
that
he
got
at
the
a
week
ago
monday
was
the
night
of
the
church
sociable
and
he
had
on
his
sunday
cutaway
and
he
ai
worn
it
sence
till
the
party
yesterday
when
he
took
off
the
coat
goin
to
bed
the
letter
fell
out
of
it
i
guess
he
was
ashamed
to
fetch
it
round
himself
so
he
asked
me
to
do
it
better
late
than
never
hey
here
that
list
at
he
produced
the
list
and
handed
it
to
the
captain
for
inspection
the
latter
looked
it
over
made
a
few
comments
and
suggestions
and
told
his
friend
to
heave
ahead
and
land
as
many
of
the
listed
as
possible
this
tidditt
promised
to
do
and
replacing
the
papers
in
his
pocket
started
for
the
gate
oh
say
ase
the
town
clerk
his
hand
on
the
gate
latch
turned
well
what
is
it
he
asked
do
keep
me
no
you
can
help
i
got
work
to
do
i
all
right
i
wo
stop
you
only
fallin
in
love
is
kind
of
epidemic
down
at
the
boardin
house
i
guess
who
is
it
that
got
you
in
tow
matildy
what
are
you
talkin
about
did
i
tell
you
to
quit
namin
me
with
matildy
tripp
i
like
a
joke
as
well
as
most
folks
but
when
it
wore
into
the
ground
i
sho
sho
do
get
mad
it
your
own
fault
you
said
that
was
a
love
symptom
so
i
just
got
to
thinkin
all
that
letter
that
bailey
forgot
you
have
given
it
to
me
asaph
turned
red
and
hastily
snatched
the
papers
from
his
pocket
he
strode
back
to
the
door
of
the
woodshed
handed
his
friend
the
crumpled
envelope
and
stalked
off
without
another
word
the
captain
chuckled
laid
the
letter
on
the
bench
beside
him
and
went
on
with
his
work
it
was
perhaps
ten
minutes
later
when
happening
to
glance
at
the
postmark
on
the
envelope
he
saw
that
it
was
concord
asaph
trip
to
the
made
a
full
day
for
him
he
returned
to
the
perfect
boarding
house
just
at
supper
time
during
the
meal
he
realized
that
bangs
seemed
to
be
trying
to
attract
his
attention
whenever
he
glanced
in
that
gentleman
direction
his
glance
was
met
by
winks
and
mystifying
shakes
of
the
head
losing
patience
at
last
he
demanded
to
know
what
was
the
matter
want
to
say
somethin
to
me
do
you
he
inquired
briskly
if
you
do
out
with
it
do
set
there
workin
your
face
as
if
was
wound
up
like
a
clockwork
this
remark
had
the
effect
of
turning
all
the
other
faces
toward
bailey
he
was
very
much
upset
no
no
he
stammered
no
no
i
do
want
you
for
nothin
was
i
makin
my
face
go
i
i
did
know
it
i
been
washin
carriages
and
cleanin
up
the
barn
all
day
and
i
i
overdone
i
old
and
hard
work
likely
to
bring
on
shakin
palsy
to
old
his
wife
tartly
observed
that
if
work
was
the
cause
of
it
she
guessed
he
was
safe
from
palsy
for
quite
a
spell
yet
at
any
rate
a
marked
recovery
set
in
and
he
signaled
no
more
during
the
meal
but
when
it
was
over
and
his
task
as
completed
he
hurried
out
of
doors
and
found
tidditt
shivering
in
the
november
wind
on
the
front
porch
now
what
is
it
asked
asaph
sharply
i
know
there
somethin
and
i
froze
to
death
by
sections
waitin
to
hear
have
you
seen
cy
whispered
bailey
glancing
fearfully
over
his
shoulder
at
the
lighted
windows
of
the
house
no
not
sence
mornin
why
well
there
somethin
the
matter
with
him
somethin
serious
i
was
swabbin
decks
in
the
barn
about
eleven
when
he
come
in
white
and
shaky
and
so
nervous
he
could
stand
still
looked
as
if
he
had
had
a
stroke
almost
i
godfrey
scissors
you
do
heman
comin
back
has
knocked
out
his
chances
for
the
committee
do
you
no
that
cy
anxious
to
be
elected
and
all
but
you
know
his
politics
are
more
of
a
joke
with
him
than
anything
else
and
any
rap
heman
or
tad
could
give
him
would
only
make
him
fight
harder
and
he
would
talk
politics
at
all
did
seem
to
give
a
durn
about
one
way
or
no
was
somethin
about
that
letter
the
one
i
forgot
so
long
he
wanted
to
know
why
in
time
i
had
given
it
to
him
when
it
fust
come
he
was
real
ugly
about
it
for
him
and
kept
up
and
down
the
barn
floor
and
layin
into
me
till
i
begun
to
think
he
was
crazy
i
guess
he
see
my
feelin
were
hurt
just
afore
he
left
he
held
out
his
hand
and
said
i
must
mind
his
talk
he
been
knocked
on
his
beam
ends
he
said
and
wa
really
would
he
say
what
had
knocked
him
no
could
get
nothin
out
of
him
and
when
he
quit
he
went
off
toward
home
slappin
his
fists
together
and
actin
as
if
he
did
see
the
road
across
his
bows
now
you
know
how
cool
and
easy
goin
whit
generally
is
i
swan
to
man
ase
he
made
me
so
sorry
for
him

know
what
to

up
to
see
him
sence
no
ketury
was
sot
on
havin
the
barn

and
she
stood
over
me
with
a
rope
end
as
you
might
say
i
could
get
away
a
minute
though
i
made
up
a
dozen
errands
at
simmons
and
the
like
of
that
you
hold
on
till
i
sneak
into
the
entry
and
get
my
cap
and
put
for

but
a
jiffy
i
they
entered
the
yard
of
the
cy
whittaker
place
together
and
approached
the
side
door
as
they
stood
on
the
steps
asaph
touched
his
chum
on
the
arm
and
pointed
to
the
window
beside
them
the
shade
was
half
drawn
and
beneath
it
they
had
a
clear
view
of
the
interior
of
the
sitting
room
captain
cy
was
in
the
rocker
before
the
stove
holding
in
his
arms
the
child
was
sound
asleep
her
yellow
braid
hanging
over
the
captain
broad
shoulder
he
was
gazing
down
into
her
face
with
a
look
which
was
so
full
of
yearning
and
love
that
it
brought
a
choke
into
the
throats
of
the
pair
who
saw
it
they
entered
the
dining
room
the
captain
sprang
from
his
chair
and
still
holding
the
little
girl
close
against
his
breast
met
them
at
the
door
when
he
saw
who
the
visitors
were
he
caught
his
breath
almost
with
a
sob
and
seemed
relieved
he
whispered
warningly
she
the
members
of
the
board
of
strategy
nodded
understandingly
and
sat
down
upon
the
sofa
captain
cy
tiptoed
to
the
bedroom
turned
back
the
bedclothes
with
one
hand
and
laid
down
they
saw
him
tuck
her
carefully
in
and
then
stoop
and
kiss
her
he
returned
to
the
sitting
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
we
see
she
was
asleep
afore
we
come
in
explained
asaph
we
see
you
and
her
through
the
the
captain
looked
hurriedly
at
the
window
indicated
then
he
stepped
over
and
pulled
the
shade
down
to
the
sill
doing
the
same
with
the
curtains
of
the
other
two
windows
what
the
matter
inquired
bailey
trying
to
be
facetious
of
crowd
spyin
on
us
captain
cy
did
not
reply
he
did
not
even
sit
down
but
remained
standing
his
back
to
the
stove
well
he
asked
shortly
did
you
fellers
want
to
see
me
for
anything

to
see
what

struck
you
all
to
once
replied
tidditt

riz
and
hollered
at
you

captain

forehead

repeated
absently

myself
do
mind
my
barkin
i
do
mean
it
i
am
about
sick
i
be
better
what
got
into
you
was
that
letter
of
bailey
hush
the
captain
held
up
his
hand
i
thought
i
heard
a
depot
wagon
most
likely
said
bailey
about
time
for
it
humph
seems
to
be
stoppin
do
it
was
you
expectin
anybody
shall
i
go
and
no
set
the
pair
on
the
sofa
sat
still
captain
cy
stood
like
a
statue
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
he
squared
his
shoulders
and
jammed
his
clenched
fists
into
his
pockets
steps
crunched
the
gravel
of
the
walk
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
of
the
dining
room
walking
steadily
but
with
a
face
set
as
the
figurehead
on
one
of
his
own
ships
the
captain
went
to
answer
the
knock
they
heard
the
door
open
and
then
a
man
voice
asked
is
this
whittaker
yes
was
the
short
answer
well
cap
i
guess
you
do
know
me
though
maybe
you
know
some
of
my
family
ha
ha
do
understand
that
hey
well
you
let
me
in
and
explain
the
the
captain
reply
was
calm
and
deliberate
i
should
wonder
if
i
understood
it
he
said
come
in
do
the
remainder
of
the
sentence
was
whispered
and
the
listeners
on
the
sofa
could
not
hear
it
a
moment
later
captain
cy
entered
the
sitting
room
followed
by
his
caller
the
latter
was
a
stranger
he
was
a
man
of
medium
height
with
a
yellowish
mustache
and
brown
hair
he
was
dressed
in
rather
shabby
clothes
without
an
overcoat
and
he
had
a
soft
felt
hat
in
his
hand
the
most
noticeable
thing
about
him
was
a
slight
hesitancy
in
his
walk
he
was
not
lame
he
did
not
limp
yet
his
left
foot
seemed
to
halt
for
an
instant
as
he
brought
it
forward
in
the
step
they
learned
afterwards
that
it
had
been
hurt
in
a
mine
he
carried
himself
with
a
swagger
and
after
his
entrance
there
was
a
perceptible
aroma
of
alcohol
in
the
room
he
stared
at
the
board
of
strategy
and
the
stare
was
returned
in
full
measure
bailey
and
asaph
were
wildly
curious
they
of
course
connected
the
stranger
arrival
with
the
mysterious
letter
and
the
captain
perturbation
of
the
day
but
their
curiosity
was
not
to
be
satisfied
at
least
not
then
how
are
you
gents
hailed
the
newcomer
cheerfully
like
the
looks
of
me
do
you
captain
cy
cut
off
further
conversation
ase
he
said
this
er
gentleman
and
i
have
got
some
business
to
talk
over
i
know
you
good
enough
friends
of
mine
not
to
mind
if
i
ask
you
to
clear
out
you
understand
you
will
understand
boys
wo
you
he
added
almost
entreatingly
sartin
sure
replied
tidditt
rising
hurriedly
do
say
another
word
and
the
mystified
bangs
concurred
with
a
yes
yes
why
of
course
did
have
nothin
that
amounts
to
nothin
to
stay
for
anyhow
see
you
outside
and
at
the
gate
they
stopped
and
looked
at
each
other
well
exclaimed
asaph
if
that
ai
the
strangest
thing
who
was
that
feller
where
he
come
from
did
you
notice
how
cy
acted
seemed
to
be
holdin
himself
in
by
main
did
you
smell
the
rum
on
him
returned
bailey
on
that
chap
i
mean
did
he
look
like
a
to
you
and
say
ase
did
he
remind
you
of
somebody
you
seen
somewheres
kind
of
in
a
way
they
walked
home
in
a
dazed
state
asking
unanswerable
questions
and
making
profitless
guesses
but
asaph
final
remark
seemed
to
sum
up
the
situation
there
trouble
comin
of
this
bailey
he
declared
and
it
trouble
for
cy
whittaker
i
afraid
poor
old
cy
well
we
stand
by
him
anyhow
i
do
believe
he
sleep
much
did
look
as
though
he
would
did
he
who
is
that
feller
if
he
had
seen
captain
cy
at
two
the
next
morning
sitting
by
bedside
and
gazing
hopelessly
at
the
child
he
would
have
realized
that
if
his
former
predictions
were
wiped
off
the
slate
and
he
could
be
judged
by
the
one
concerning
the
captain
sleepless
night
he
might
thereafter
pose
as
a
true
prophet

big
dipper

i
hello
said
a
voice
the
pair
looked
up
the
man
who
had
arrived
on
the
previous
night
stood
in
the
doorway
how
long
he
had
been
standing
there
the
captain
did
not
know
what
he
did
know
was
that
john
smith
by
daylight
was
not
more
prepossessing
than
the
same
individual
viewed
by
the
aid
of
a
lamp
emily
saw
the
stranger
and
slid
from
captain
cy
knees
the
captain
rose
he
said
this
is
er
smith
who
goin
to
make
us
a
little
visit
i
want
you
to
shake
hands
with
the
girl
dutifully
approached
smith
and
extended
her
hand
he
took
it
and
held
it
in
his
own
is
this
the
he
began
captain
cy
bowed
assent
yes
he
said
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
visitor
face
yes
do
forget
what
you
said
last
smith
shook
his
head
no
he
replied
i
ai
the
kind
that
forgets
unless
it
pays
pretty
well
there
some
things
i
remembered
for
quite
a
few
he
looked
the
child
over
from
head
to
foot
and
his
brows
drew
together
in
an
ugly
frown
so
this
is
her
hey
he
muttered
musingly
humph
well
i
do
know
as
i
have
guessed
it
favors
the
other
side
of
the
house
more
the
respectable
side
i
should
say
still
there
a
little
brand
of
the
lost
sheep
hey
enough
to
prove
property
huh
mark
of
the
beast
i
the
relations
would
call
it
d
n
em
i
steady
broke
in
the
captain
smith
started
seemed
to
remember
where
he
was
and
his
manner
changed
come
and
see
me
honey
he
coaxed
drawing
the
girl
toward
him
by
the
hand
he
was
holding
ai
you
got
a
nice
kiss
for
me
this
fine
mornin
do
be
scared
i
wo
looked
shrinkingly
at
smith
unshaven
cheeks
and
then
at
captain
cy
the
latter
face
was
absolutely
devoid
of
expression
he
merely
nodded
so
emily
kissed
one
of
the
bristling
cheeks
the
kiss
was
returned
full
upon
the
mouth
she
wiped
her
lips
and
darted
away
to
her
chair
by
the
table
what
your
hurry
inquired
the
visitor
do
i
do
it
right
been
some
time
since
i
kissed
a
girl
a
little
one
anyhow
he
added
winking
at
his
host
never
mind
we
know
each
other
better
by
and
he
looked
on
in
wondering
disgust
as
said
her
what
in
blazes
he
burst
out
when
the
little
blessing
was
finished
who
put
her
up
to
that
a
from
the
is
it
i
do
know
answered
the
captain
speaking
with
deliberation
i
do
know
that

like
to
have
her
do
it
and
that
she
shall
do
it
as
she
at
this

shall

i
reckon
she
shall
as
long
as
she
at
this
table
is
that
real
plain
and
understandable
or
shall
i
write
it
down
there
was
an
icy
clearness
in
the
captain
tone
which
seemed
to
freeze
further
conversation
on
the
part
of
smith
he
merely
grunted
and
ate
his
breakfast
in
silence
he
ate
a
great
deal
and
ate
it
rapidly
departed
for
school
when
the
meal
was
over
captain
cy
helped
her
on
with
her
coat
and
hood
then
as
he
always
did
of
late
he
kissed
her

the
captain
sharply

right

he
entered
the
sitting
room
his
guest
had
found
the
sunday
box
and
was
lighting
one
of
his
host
cigars
well
he
inquired
easily
what
next
on
the
bill

goin
on
in
this
forsaken
hole
there
a
barber
shop
down
the
road
you

novelty
humph

razor

as
a
new
egg
what
is
your
little
game
anyway

one
so

me
you
captain
cy
was
plainly
embarrassed
he
gazed
at
the
shore
to
shore
picture
on
the
wall
as
he
answered
no
game
about
it
he
said
last
night

i
agreed
that

to
be
said
for
a
few
days

to
make

little
more
than

rights

it

to
be
humph
smith
seemed
to
be
thinking
then
he
added
looking
up
keenly
under
his
brows
how
about
the
the
incumbrance
on
the
property
of
course
when
i
go
i
have
to
take
that
with

and
captain
cy
interrupted
there

he
exclaimed
and
there
was
a
shake
in
his
voice
there
there
do
let
talk
about
such
things
now
i
i
let
wait
a
spell

some
more
plans
to

maybe
if

want
to
use
my
razor

right
in
that
drawer

the
visitor
laughed
aloud
he
nodded
as
if
satisfied
ho

he
chuckled
i

little
shy
of

the
captain
reached
into
his
pocket
extracted
a
bill
and
passed
it
to
the
speaker
smith
smiled
and
shook
his
head
you
ca
come

on
that
pard
he
said
the
limit
captain
cy
took
back
the
bill
and
exchanged
it
for
one
with
a
v
in
each
corner
the
visitor
took
it
and
turned
toward
the
door
ta

he
said
taking
his
hat
from
the
peg
in
the
dining
room

off
for
the
clippers

come
back
i

the
captain
sat
down
to
the
dinner
at
noon
alone
smith
had
not
returned
from
his
trip
to
the
barber
he
came
in
however
just
before
the
meal
was
over
still
in
an
unshorn
condition
somewhat
flushed
and
very
loquacious
say
he
exclaimed
genially
that
simpson
the
right
sort
ai
he
him
and
me
took
a
shine
to
each
other
from
the
he
been
west
himself
and
he
got
some
width
to
him
he
no
psalm
humph
commented
the
captain
with
delicate
sarcasm
he
do
seem
to
be
much
of
a
barber
either
what
the
matter
gone
out
of
business
has
he
or
was
you
so
wild
or
woolly
he
got
discouraged
before
he
begun
great
snakes
exclaimed
the
visitor
i
forgot
all
about
the
clippers
well
that
one
on
me
pard

a
new
try
soon
grub
over
do
be
so
with
the
steak
this
is
a
plate
i
passin
not
a
contribution
he
winked
at
and
would
have
chucked
her
under
the
chin
if
she
had
not
dodged
she
seemed
to
have
taken
a
great
aversion
to
smith
and
was
plainly
afraid
of
him
is
he
going
to
stay
very
long
uncle
cyrus
she
whispered
when
it
was
school
time
once
more
do
you
think
he
nice
captain
cy
did
not
answer
when
she
had
gone
and
the
guest
had
risen
from
the
table
and
put
on
his
hat
the
captain
said
warningly
there
one
little
bit
of
advice
i
want
to
give
you
mister
man
a
bargain
a
bargain
but
it
takes
two
to
keep
it
do
let
your
love
for
tad
simpson
lead
you
into
talkin
too
much
talk
cheap
they
say
but
too
much
of
it
might
be
mighty
dear
for
you
understand
smith
patted
him
on
the
back
lord
love
you
pard
he
chuckled
no
spring
chicken
i
as
hard
to
open
as
a
safe
i
am
it
takes
a
can
opener
to
get
anything
out
of
yes
well
you
can
get
inside
some
folks
easier
with
a
corkscrew
been
told
that
tad
a
kind
of
a
medium
sometimes
if
he
raises
any
spirits
in
that
back
room
of
his
i
leave
alone
if
i
was
you
so
long
as
you
decent
i
put
up
with
but
smith
was
on
his
way
to
the
gate
whistling
as
if
he
had
a
care
in
the
world
captain
cy
watched
him
go
down
the
road
and
then
with
the
drawn
weary
look
on
his
face
which
had
been
there
since
the
day
before
he
entered
the
sitting
room
and
threw
himself
into
a
chair
miss
phoebe
dawes
the
school
teacher
worked
late
that
evening
there
were
examination
papers
to
be
gone
over
and
experience
had
demonstrated
that
the
only
place
where
she
could
be
free
from
interruptions
was
the
schoolroom
itself
at
the
perfect
boarding
house
the
shrill
tones
of
keturah
voice
and
those
of
miss
phinney
and
tripp
penetrated
through
shut
doors
it
is
hard
to
figure
percentages
when
the
most
intimate
details
of
bayport
family
life
are
being
recited
and
gloated
over
on
the
other
side
of
a
thin
partition
and
when
matilda
undertook
to
defend
the
faith
against
the
assaults
of
the
majority
the
verbal
riot
was
as
tidditt
described
it
like
feedin
time
in
a
parrot
so
miss
phoebe
came
to
the
boarding
house
for
supper
and
then
returned
to
the
schoolroom
where
with
a
lighted
bracket
lamp
beside
her
on
the
desk
she
labored
until
nine
then
she
put
on
her
coat
and
hat
extinguished
the
light
locked
the
door
and
started
on
her
lonely
walk
home
the
main
road
in
our
village
is
dark
after
nine
o
clock
there
is
a
street
light
a
kerosene
lamp
on
a
post
in
front
of
the
methodist
meeting
house
but
the
sexton
forgets
it
generally
speaking
or
at
any
rate
neglects
to
fill
it
except
at
rare
intervals
simmons
front
windows
are
ablaze
of
course
and
so
are
the
dingy
panes
of
barber
shop
but
these
two
centers
of
sociability
are
both
at
the
depot
road
corner
and
when
they
are
passed
the
only
sources
of
illumination
are
the
scattered
gleams
from
the
back
windows
of
dwellings
as
most
of
us
retire
by
eight
the
glow
along
the
main
road
is
not
dazzling
to
say
the
very
least
miss
dawes
was
not
afraid
of
the
dark
she
had
been
her
own
escort
for
a
good
many
years
she
walked
briskly
on
heard
the
laughter
and
loud
voices
in
the
barber
shop
die
away
behind
her
passed
the
schoolhouse
pond
now
bleak
and
chill
with
the
raw
november
wind
blowing
across
it
and
began
to
climb
the
slope
of
whittaker
hill
and
here
the
wind
rushing
in
unimpeded
over
the
flooded
salt
meadows
from
the
tumbled
bay
outside
wound
her
skirts
about
her
and
made
climbing
difficult
and
she
was
perhaps
half
way
up
the
long
slope
when
she
heard
in
the
intervals
between
the
gusts
footsteps
behind
her
she
knew
most
of
the
village
people
by
this
time
and
the
thought
of
company
was
not
unpleasant
so
she
paused
and
pantingly
waited
for
whoever
was
coming
she
could
not
see
more
than
a
few
yards
but
the
footsteps
sounded
nearer
and
nearer
and
a
moment
later
a
man
voice
began
singing
annie
rooney
a
melody
then
past
its
prime
in
the
cities
but
popularized
in
bayport
by
some
departed
batch
of
summer
boarders
she
did
not
recognize
the
voice
and
she
did
not
particularly
approve
of
singing
in
the
streets
especially
such
loud
singing
so
she
decided
not
to
wait
longer
and
was
turning
to
continue
her
climb
when
the
person
behind
stopped
his
vocalizing
and
called
hi
he
shouted
hello
ahead
there
who
is
it
hold
on
a
minute
pard
i
she
disobeyed
the
order
to
hold
on
and
began
to
hurry
the
hurry
was
of
no
avail
however
for
the
follower
broke
into
a
run
and
soon
was
by
her
side
he
was
a
stranger
to
her
whee
wow
he
panted
this
is
no
race
track
pard
pull
up
and
take
it
easy
my
off
leg
got
a
kink
in
it
and
i
do
run
so
easy
as
i
used
to
great
snakes
what
your
rush
ai
you
fond
of
company
hello
i
believe
it
a
woman
she
did
not
answer
his
manner
and
the
smell
of
liquor
about
him
were
decidedly
unpleasant
the
idea
that
he
might
be
a
tramp
occurred
to
her
tramps
are
our
bugaboos
here
in
bayport
a
woman
exclaimed
the
man
hilariously
well
say
i
did
believe

was
one
loose
in
this
of
nowhere
girlie
i

other
on
trust
my
sweetheart
i
her
beau
say
maud

see

home
she
was
frightened
now
the
whittaker
place
on
the
hilltop
was
the
nearest
house
and
that
was
some
distance
off
what
the
matter
carrie
inquired
the
man

complexion

under
my
wing
and
let
toddle
along
together
how
mamma
he
seized
her
arm
and
pulled
her
back
beside
him
she
tried
to
free
herself
but
could
not
her
unwelcome
escort
held
her
fast
and
she
was
obliged
to
move
as
slowly
as
he
did
it
was
very
dark
say
what
is
your
name
coaxed
the
man
is
is
maud
hey
or

i
always

peevish
tell

that
a
good
she
gave
a
quick
jerk
and
managed
to
pull
her
arm
from
his
grasp
giving
him
a
violent
push
as
she
did
so
he
being
unsteady
on
his
feet
tumbled
down
the
low
bank
which
edged
the
sidewalk
then
she
ran
on
up
the
hill
as
fast
as
she
could
she
heard
him
swear
as
he
fell
she
had
nearly
reached
the
end
of
the
whittaker
fence
when
he
caught
her
he
was
laughing
and
that
alarmed
her
almost
as
much
as
if
he
had
been
angry
naughty
naughty
he
chuckled
holding
her
fast
tryin
to
sneak
was
you
not
much
not
this
time
did
you
ever
play
forfeits
when
you
was
little
well
this
is
a
forfeit
game
and
you
it
you
must
bow
to
the
prettiest
kneel
to
the
wittiest
and
kiss
the
one
you
love
best
and
i
let
you
off
on
the
first
two
come
now
pay
up
then
she
screamed
and
her
scream
was
answered
at
once
a
gate
swung
back
with
a
bang
and
she
heard
some
one
running
along
the
walk
toward
her
o
whittaker
she
called
come
come
quick
please
how
she
knew
that
the
person
running
toward
her
was
captain
cy
has
not
been
satisfactorily
explained
even
yet
she
can
not
explain
it
and
neither
can
the
captain
and
equally
astonishing
was
the
answer
he
certainly
had
not
heard
her
voice
often
enough
to
recognize
it
under
such
circumstances
all
right
teacher
he
shouted
i
comin
let
go
of
that
woman
you
oh
it
you
is
it
he
had
seized
smith
by
the
coat
collar
and
jerked
him
away
from
his
victim
miss
dawes
took
refuge
behind
the
captain
bulky
form
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
smith
was
recovering
his
breath
it
you
is
it
repeated
captain
cy
then
turning
to
miss
phoebe
he
asked
did
he
hurt
you
no
not

but
he
frightened
me
dreadfully
who
is
he
do
you
know
him
her
persecutor
answered
the
question
you

your
life
he

snarled

mighty
well
pard

keep
your
nose
out
of
this

i
wa

to

her
the
captain
paid
no
attention
to
him
yup
i
know
him
he
said
grimly
then
he
added
pointing
toward
the
lighted
window
of
the
house
ahead
you
smith
you
go
in
there
and
stay
there
trot
do
make
me
speak
but
smith
was
too
far
gone
with
anger
and
the
spirits
raised
by
tad
simpson
to
heed
the
menace
in
the
words
smith
hey
he
sneered
oh

house
and

shut

and
into
that
bedroom
and
just
say
here
your
he
did
finish
the
sentence
captain
cy
big
fist
struck
him
fairly
between
the
eyes
and
the
back
of
his
head
struck
the
walk
with
a
smack
then
through
the
fireworks
which
were
illuminating
his
muddled
brain
he
heard
the
captain
voice
you
low
down
good
for
nothin
scamp
growled
captain
cy
all
this
day
i

and
been
tryin
to
spunk
up
courage
to
say
all
off
but
i
was
too
much
of
a
coward
i
guess
and
now
the
lord
has
made
me
say
it
you
want
your
rights
do
you
so
then
get
if
you
can

you
smith
was
not
entirely
cowed

he
yelled
go
ahead
and
i
go
to
a
lawyer
but
and
inside
of
five
minutes
i
walk
into
that
house
of
yours
and
get
my
the
captain
dropped
miss
dawes
arm
and
strode
back
to
where
his
antagonist
was
sitting
in
the
dust
of
the
walk
stooping
down
he
shook
a
big
forefinger
in
the
man
face
you
been
out
west
they
tell
me
he
whispered
sternly
yes
well
out
west
they
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
sometimes
i
hear
been
in
south
america
and
they
do
it
there
too
just
so
sure
as
you
go
into
my
house
and
touch
well
you
know
what
i
mean
just
so
sure
i
kill
you
like
a
dog
if
i
have
to
chase
you
to
jericho
now
you
can
believe
that
or
not
if
i
was
you
i
believe
taking
the
frightened
schoolmistress
by
the
arm
once
more
he
walked
away
smith
said
nothing
till
they
had
gone
some
distance
then
he
called
after
them
you
wait
till
he
shouted
you
just
wait
and
see
happen
captain
cy
was
silent
all
the
way
to
the
gate
of
the
perfect
boarding
house
miss
dawes
was
silent
likewise
but
she
thought
a
great
deal
at
the
gate
she
said
captain
whittaker
i
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
i
ca
thank
you
do
try
then
that
what
you
said
to
me
about
the
but
i
almost
sorry
you
were
the
one
to
come
i
afraid
that
man
will
get
you
into
trouble
has
he
can
he
what
did
he
mean
about
who
is
he
the
captain
pushed
his
cap
back
from
his
forehead
teacher
he
said
there
a
proverb
ai
there
about
take
care
of
itself
as
for
trouble
well
i
did
think
i
had
trouble
enough
in
my
life
to
last
me
through
but
i
i
got
another
guess
anyhow
do
you
fret
i
did
just
the
right
thing
and
i
glad
i
did
it
if
it
was
only
me
i
would
fret
either
but
there
he
stopped
groaned
and
pulled
the
cap
forward
again
good
night
he
added
and
turned
to
go
miss
dawes
leaned
forward
and
detained
him
just
a
minute
whittaker
she
said
i
was
a
little
prejudiced
against
you
when
i
came
here
i
was
told
that
you
got
me
the
position
and
there
was
more
than
a
hint
that
you
did
it
for
selfish
reasons
of
your
own
when
you
called
that
afternoon
at
the
school
i
was
do
say
a
word
i
was
the
biggest
fool
in
town
that
time
and
been
ashamed
to
look
in
the
glass
ever
since
i
ai
always
such
an
but
i
had
to
judge
people
for
myself
in
my
lifetime
continued
the
schoolmistress
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
was
mistaken
about
you
i
should
like
to
apologize
will
you
shake
hands
she
extended
her
hand
captain
cy
hesitated
had
you
better
wait
a
spell
he
asked
you
heard
that
swab
call
me
partner

no

do
know
what
your
trouble
is
of
course
and
i
certainly

mention
it
to
anyone
but
whatever
it
is
i
sure
you
are
right
and
it
not
your
fault
now
will
you
shake
hands
the
captain
did
not
answer
he
merely
took
the
proffered
hand
shook
it
heartily
and
strode
off
into
the
dark

seems
to
be
all
right
i
stopped
in
on
the
way
along
and
cy
said
not
to
wait
he
be
here
on
time
he
been
kind
of
off
his
feed
for
the
last
day
or
so
and
i
he
did
feel
like
hurryin
say
joe
now
honest
what
do
you
think
of
my
chances
such
a
confirmed
joker
as
dimick
could
lose
an
opportunity
like
this
with
the
aid
of
one
trying
to
be
cheerful
under
discouragement
he
answered
that
so
far
asaph
chances
looked
fair
pretty
fair
but
of
course
you
could
always
sometimes
tell
tidditt
rushed
away
to
begin
the
handshaking
all
over
again
from
this
round
of
cordiality
he
was
reluctantly
torn
and
conducted
to
the
platform
after
thumping
the
desk
with
his
fist
he
announced
that
the
gathering
would
come
to
order
right
off
as
there
was
business
to
be
done
and
it
ought
to
be
goin
he
then
proceeded
to
read
the
call
for
the
meeting
this
ceremony
was
no
sooner
over
than
abednego
small
uncle
bedny
was
on
his
feet
loudly
demanding
to
be
informed
why
the
town
had
done
nothin
toward
fixing
up
the
bassett
hollow
road
uncle
bedny
speech
had
proceeded
no
further
than
feller
citizens
in
the
name
of
an
outrageous
i
should
say
outraged
portion
of
our
community
i
when
he
was
choked
off
by
a
committee
who
knew
small
of
old
and
had
seated
themselves
near
him
to
be
ready
for
just
such
emergencies
the
next
step
judged
by
meetings
of
other
years
should
have
been
to
unanimously
elect
eben
salters
moderator
but
as
captain
eben
refused
to
serve
owing
to
his
interest
in
the
whittaker
campaign
alvin
knowles
was
by
a
small
majority
chosen
for
that
office
knowles
was
a
devout
admirer
of
the
great
atkins
and
his
election
would
have
been
considered
a
preliminary
victory
for
the
opposition
had
it
not
been
that
many
of
captain
cy
adherents
voted
for
alvin
from
a
love
of
mischief
knowing
from
experience
his
ignorance
of
parliamentary
law
and
his
rule
now
there
be
fun
declared
one
delighted
individual
anything
in
order
when
alvin
the
proceedings
of
the
first
half
hour
were
disappointingly
tame
most
of
us
had
come
there
to
witness
a
political
wrestling
match
between
tad
simpson
and
cyrus
whittaker
some
even
dared
hope
that
congressman
atkins
might
direct
his
fight
in
person
but
neither
the
honorable
nor
captain
cy
was
in
the
hall
as
yet
solon
eldridge
was
selectman
and
so
also
was
asaph
tidditt
nobody
but
asaph
seemed
surprised
at
this
result
his
speech
of
acceptance
would
undoubtedly
have
been
a
triumph
of
oratory
had
it
not
been
interrupted
by
uncle
bedny
who
rose
to
emphatically
protest
against
settin
round
and
wastin
time
when
the
bassett
hollow
road
had
ruts
deep
enough
to
drown
a
cat
in
whenever
there
was
a
average
heavy
the
bassett
hollow
delegate
being
again
temporarily
squelched
moderator
knowles
announced
that
nominations
for
the
vacant
place
on
the
school
committee
were
in
order
there
was
a
perceptible
stir
on
the
settees
this
was
what
the
meeting
had
been
waiting
for
no
sign
of
cy
or
heman
yet
observed
cahoon
craning
his
neck
in
the
direction
of
the
door
it
the
queerest
thing
ever
i
queer
enough
about
cy
that
a
fact
concurred
captain
dimick
i
ai
so
surprised
about
heman
not
comin
looks
as
if
whit
was
right
he
always
said
atkins
dodged
a
row
where
folks
could
watch
it
does
most
of
his
fightin
from
round
the
corner
hello
there
tad
now
see
the
crown
of
glory
set
on
snow
head
hope
the
padded
nice
and
soft
anything
with
sharp
edges
would
sink
but
simpson
it
seemed
was
not
yet
ready
to
proceed
with
the
coronation
he
had
risen
to
ask
permission
of
the
meeting
to
defer
the
school
committee
matter
for
a
short
time
persons
important
persons
who
should
be
present
while
the
nominating
was
going
on
had
not
yet
arrived
he
was
sure
that
the
gathering
would
wish
to
hear
from
these
persons
he
asked
for
only
a
slight
delay
matters
such
as
this
affecting
the
welfare
of
our
posterity
ought
not
to
be
hurried
etc
simpson
request
was
unexpected
the
meeting
apparently
know
how
to
take
it
uncle
bedny
was
firmly
held
in
his
seat
by
those
about
him
lemuel
myrick
took
the
floor
to
protest
i
must
say
he
declared
that
i
do
see
any
reason
for
waitin
if
folks
ai
here
that
their
own
fault
moderator
i
demand
that
the
nominatin

on
his
feet
instantly
i
goin
to
appeal
he
cried
to
the
decency
and
gratitude
of
the
citizens
of
the
town
of
bayport
one
of
the
persons
i
that
is
waitin

done
more
for
our
beautiful
village
than

lovely
memorial
window
a
how
about
that
harbor
appropriation
cried
a
voice
from
the
settees
simpson
was
taken
aback
his
face
flushed
and
he
angrily
turned
toward
the
interrupter
that
you

dimick
he
shouted
pointing
an
agitated
forefinger

another

to
face
his
new
tormentor

grunted
with
sarcasm

toward
the
door
captain
cy
had
entered
the
hall
he
was
standing
in
the
aisle
and
with
him
was
bailey
bangs
the
captain
looked
very
tired
almost
worn
out
but
he
nodded
coolly
to
simpson
who
had
retired
to
his
seat
with
surprising
quickness
and
apparent
discomfiture
here
i
am
tad
continued
the
captain
say
your
but
tad
it
appeared
was
not
anxious
to
say
his
he
was
whispering
earnestly
with
a
group
of
his
followers
captain
cy
held
up
his
hand
mr
moderator
he
asked
can
i
have
the
floor
a
minute
all
i
want
to
say
is
that
i
i
the
feller
the
last
speaker

so
hard
to

i
say

and
why
not
ours
i
did
say

he
added
raising
his
voice
i
say
that
if
i
was
sent
to
by
this
town
congressman
or
not
i
move
heaven
and
earth

from
the
president
down
till
i
did
get
it
that
all
so
would
any
live
man
i
should
he
sat
down
there
was
some
applause
before
it
had
subsided
abel
leonard
one
of
the
of
simpson
workers
was
on
his
feet
gesticulating
for
attention
mr
moderator
he
shouted
i
want
to
make
a
motion
we
all
heard
the
big
talk
that
been
made
all
right
then
i
move
you
sir
that
captain
cyrus
whittaker
be
appointed
a
committee
of
one
to
go
to
if
he
wants
to
or
anywheres
else
and
see
that
we
get
the
appropriation
and
if
we
do
get
it
the
blame
his
there
now
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
this
was
exactly
the
sort
of
humor
that
appeals
to
a
yankee
crowd
the
motion
was
seconded
half
a
dozen
times
moderator
knowles
grinned
and
shook
his
head
a
joke
a
joke
he
said
and
we
all
like
a
good
one
however
this
meetin
is
supposed
to
be
for
business
not
fun
so
question
question
it
been
seconded
we
got
to
vote
on
it
shouted
a
chorus
do
you
think
seems
to
me
that
ai
in
order
began
the
moderator
but
captain
cy
rose
to
his
feet
the
grim
smile
had
returned
to
his
face
and
he
looked
at
the
joyous
assemblage
with
almost
his
old
expression
of
appreciative
alertness
never
mind
the
vote
he
said
i
realize
that
brother
leonard
has
rather
got
one
on
me
so
to
speak
all
right
i
wo
dodge
i
be
a
committee
of
one
on
the
harbor
grab
and
if
nothin
comes
of
it
take
my
share
of
kicks
gentlemen
i
appreciate
your
trustfulness
in
my
this
brief
speech
was
a
huge
success
if
for
a
moment
the
pendulum
of
public
favor
had
swung
toward
simpson
this
trumping
of
the
leading
card
pushed
it
back
again
the
moderator
had
some
difficulty
in
restoring
order
to
the
hilarious
meeting
then
myrick
was
accorded
the
privilege
of
the
floor
in
spite
of
tad
protests
and
proceeded
to
nominate
cyrus
whittaker
for
the
school
committee
lem
had
devoted
hours
of
toil
and
wearisome
mental
struggle
to
the
preparation
of
his
address
and
it
was
lengthy
and
florid
captain
cy
was
described
as
possessing
all
the
virtues
bailey
listening
with
a
hand
behind
his
ear
was
moved
to
applause
at
frequent
intervals
and
even
asaph
forgot
the
dignity
of
his
exalted
position
on
the
platform
and
pounded
the
official
desk
in
ecstasy
the
only
person
to
appear
uninterested
was
the
nominee
himself
he
sat
listlessly
in
his
seat
his
eyes
cast
down
and
his
thoughts
apparently
far
away
josiah
dimick
seconded
the
captain
nomination
then
simpson
stepped
to
the
front
and
after
a
wistful
glance
at
the
door
began
to
speak
feller
citizens
he
said
it
is
my
privilege
to
put
in
nomination
for
school
committee
a
man
whose
name
stands
for
all
that
good
and
clean
and
progressive
in
this
township
but
afore
i
do
it
i
goin
to
ask
you
to
let
me
say
a
word
or
two
concernin
somethin
that
bears
right
on
this
matter
and
which
i
believe
everyone
of
you
ought
to
know
somethin
that
most
of
you
do
know
and
it
be
a
surprise
a
big
surprise
i
be
as
quick
as
i
can
and
i
you
thank
me
when
i
he
paused
the
meeting
looked
at
each
other
in
astonishment
there
was
whispering
along
the
settees
moderator
knowles
was
plainly
puzzled
he
looked
inquiringly
at
the
town
clerk
but
asaph
was
evidently
quite
as
much
in
the
dark
as
he
concerning
the
threatened
disclosure
feller
bayporters
went
on
tad
there
one
thing
we
all
agreed
on
no
matter
who
we
meant
to
vote
for
that
is
that
a
member
of
our
school
committee
should
be
an
upright
honest
man
one
fit
morally
to
look
out
for
our
dear
children
ai
that
so
well
then
i
ask
you
this
would
you
consider
a
man
fit
for
that
job
who
deliberately
came
between
a
father
and
his
child
who
pizened
the
mind
of
that
child
against
his
own
parent
and
when
that
parent
come
to
claim
that
child
first
tried
to
buy
him
off
and
then
turned
him
out
of
the
house
yes
and
offered
violence
to
him
and
done
it
mark
what
i
say
for
reasons
which
which
well
we
can
only
guess
but
the
guess
may
not
be
so
awful
bad
is
that
the
kind
of
man
we
want
to
honor
or
to
look
out
for
our
own
children
schoolin
simpson
undoubtedly
meant
to
cause
a
sensation
by
his
opening
remarks
he
certainly
did
so
the
stir
and
whispering
redoubled
asaph
his
mouth
open
stared
wildly
down
at
captain
cy
the
captain
rose
to
his
feet
then
sank
back
again
his
listlessness
was
gone
and
paying
no
attention
to
those
about
him
he
gazed
fixedly
at
tad
gentlemen
continued
the
speaker
last
night
i
had
an
experience
that
i
sha
forget
as
long
as
i
live
i
met
a
poor
man
a
poor
lame
man
who
been
away
out
west
and
got
hurt
bad
folks
thought
he
was
dead
his
wife
thought
so
and
died
grievin
for
him
she
left
a
little
baby
girl
only
seven
or
eight
year
old
when
this
man
come
back
well
again
but
poor
to
look
up
his
family
he
found
his
wife
had
passed
away
and
the
child
had
been
sent
off
just
to
get
rid
of
her
to
a
stranger
in
another
town
that
stranger
fully
meant
to
send
her
off
too
he
said
so
dozens
of
times
a
good
many
of
you
folks
right
here
heard
him
say
it
but
he
never
sent
her
he
kept
her
why
well
that
the
question
sha
answer
it
ai
accusin
nobody
all
i
say
is
what
easy
enough
for
any
of
you
to
prove
and
that
is
that
it
come
to
light
the
child
had
property
belongin
to
her
property
land
wuth
money
he
paused
once
more
and
drew
his
sleeve
across
his
forehead
most
of
his
hearers
were
silent
now
on
tiptoe
of
expectation
dimick
looked
searchingly
at
captain
cy
then
he
sprang
to
his
feet
order
he
shouted
what
all
this
got
to
do
with
nominatin
for
school
committee
ai
he
out
of
order
alvin
the
moderator
hesitated
his
habitual
indecision
was
now
complicated
by
the
fact
that
he
was
as
curious
as
the
majority
of
those
before
him
there
were
shouts
of
go
ahead
tad
tell
us
the
rest
let
him
go
on
moderator
cy
whittaker
slowly
rose
alvin
he
said
earnestly
do
stop
him
yet
as
a
favor
to
me
let
him
spin
his
simpson
was
ready
and
evidently
eager
to
spin
it
this
man
he
proclaimed
this
father
mournin
for
his
dead
wife
and
longin
for
his
child
comes
to
the
town
where
he
was
to
find
and
take
her
and
when
he
meets
the
man
that
got
her
when
he
comes
poor
and
down
on
his
luck
what
does
this
man
this
rich
man
do
why
fust
of
all
he
sirup
to
him
takes
him
in
keeps
him
overnight
and
the
next
day
he
says
to
him
just
be
quiet
and
say
nothin
to
nobody
that
she
your
little
girl
i
make
it
wuth
your
while
keep
quiet
till
i
ready
for
you
to
say
it
and
he
gives
the
father
money
not
much
but
some
all
right
so
fur
maybe
but
wait
then
it
turns
out
that
the
father
knows
about
this
land
this
property
and
then
the
kind
charitable
man
this
rich
man
with
lots
of
money
of
his
own
turns
the
poor
father
out
tellin
him
to
get
the
girl
and
the
land
if
he
can
knowin
knowin
mind
you
that
the
father
ai
got
a
cent
to
hire
lawyers
nor
even
to
pay
for
his
next
meal
and
when
the
father
says
he
wo
go
but
wants
his
dear
one
that
belongs
to
him
the
rich
feller
abuses
him
knocks
him
down
with
his
fist
knocks
down
a
poor
weak
lame
invalid
just
off
a
sick
bed
is
that
the
kind
of
a
man
we
want
on
our
school
committee
he
asked
the
question
with
both
hands
outspread
and
the
perspiration
running
down
his
cheeks
the
meeting
was
in
an
uproar
no
need
for
me
to
tell
you
who
i
mean
shouted
tad
waving
his
arms
you
know
who
as
well
as
i
do
you
just
heard
him
praised
as
all
that
good
and
great
but
say
you
said
enough
now
let
me
say
a
word
it
was
captain
cy
who
interrupted
he
had
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
down
the
aisle
and
now
stood
before
the
gesticulating
simpson
who
shrank
back
as
if
he
feared
that
the
treatment
accorded
the
poor
weak
invalid
might
be
continued
with
him
knowles
said
captain
cy
turning
to
the
moderator
let
me
speak
will
you
i
wo
be
but
a
minute
friends
he
continued
facing
the
excited
gathering
for
some
of
you
are
my
friends
or
i
come
to
think
you
are
a
part
of
what
this
man
says
is
so
the
girl
at
my
house
is
emily
thomas
her
mother
was
mary
thomas
who
some
of
you
know
and
her
father
name
is
henry
thomas
she
came
to
me
unexpected
bein
sent
by
a
oliver
up
to
concord
because
was
either
me
or
an
orphan
asylum
i
took
her
in
meanin
to
keep
her
a
little
while
and
then
send
her
away
but
as
time
went
on
i
kept
puttin
off
and
puttin
off
and
at
last
i
realized
i
could
do
it
i
come
to
think
too
much
of
her
fellers
he
went
on
slowly
i
i
hardly
know
how
to
tell
you
what
that
little
girl
come
to
be
to
me
when
i
first
struck
bayport
after
forty
years
away
from
it
all
i
thought
of
was
makin
over
the
old
place
and
livin
in
it
i
it
would
be
a
sort
of
paradise
and
how
i
was
goin
to
live
or
whether
or
not
i
be
lonesome
with
everyone
of
my
folks
dead
and
gone
never
crossed
my
mind
but
the
longer
i
lived
there
alone
the
less
like
paradise
it
got
to
be
i
realized
more
and
more
that
it
ai
furniture
and
fixin
that
make
a
home
it
them
you
love
that
in
it
and
just
as
i
about
reached
the
conclusion
that
was
a
failure
the
whole
business
why
then
emily
that
is
dropped
in
and
inside
of
a
week
i
knew
i
got
what
was
missin
in
my
life
i
never
married
and
children
never
meant
much
to
me
till
i
got
her
she
the
best
little
little
there
i
must
talk
this
way
i
bluffed
a
lot
about
not
keepin
her
permanent
bein
kind
of
ashamed
i
guess
but
down
inside
me
i
made
up
my
mind
to
bring
her
up
like
a
daughter
she
and
me
was
to
live
together
till
she
grew
up
and
got
married
and
i
well
what
the
use
a
few
days
ago
come
a
letter
from
the
oliver
woman
in
concord
sayin
that
this
henry
thomas
father
wa
dead
at
all
but
had
turned
up
there
havin
learned
somehow
or
that
his
wife
was
gone
and
that
his
child
had
been
willed
a
little
bit
of
land
which
belonged
to
her
mother
he
had
found
out
that
emmie
was
with
me
and
the
letter
said
he
would
likely
come
after
her
and
the
land
that
letter
was
like
a
flash
of
lightnin
to
me
i
was
dismasted
and
on
my
beam
ends
i
did
know
what
to
do
i
learned
enough
about
this
henry
thomas
to
know
that
he
was
no
use
a
drunken
scamp
who
had
cruelized
his
wife
and
then
run
off
and
left
her
and
the
baby
but
when
he
come
the
very
night
i
got
the
letter
i
gave
him
a
chance
i
took
him
in
i
was
willin
to
give
him
a
job
on
the
place
i
was
willin
to
pay
for
his
keep
and
more
i
did
ask
him
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
and
even
to
use
another
name
was
weak
of
me
maybe
but
you
want
to
remember
this
had
come
on
me
sudden
and
last
night
the
very
second
night
mind
you
he
went
out
somewhere
perhaps
we
can
guess
where
bought
liquor
with
the
money
i
gave
him
got
drunk
and
then
insulted
one
of
the
best
women
in
this
town
yes
sir
i
say
it
right
here
one
of
the
best
pluckiest
little
women
anywhere
although
she
and
i
ai
always
agreed
on
certain
matters
i
did
tell
him
to
clear
out
and
i
did
knock
him
down
yes
and
by
the
big
dipper
i
do
it
again
under
the
same
circumstances
as
for
the
property
he
added
fiercely
why
darn
the
property
i
say
it
ai
wuth
much
anyhow
and
if
was
anybody
else
he
should
have
it
and
welcome
but
it
and
bein
what
he
is
he
have
it
and
he
sha
have
her
to
cruelize
neither
by
the
almighty
he
sha
so
long
as
i
got
a
dollar
to
fight
him
with
i
say
that
to
you
tad
simpson
and
to
the
man
to
whoever
put
you
up
to
this
there
i
said
my
say
now
gentlemen
you
can
choose
your
he
strode
back
to
his
seat
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
josiah
dimick
sprang
up
and
waved
his
hat
that
the
way
to
talk
he
shouted
that
a
man
three
cheers
for
whittaker
come
on
everybody
but
everybody
did
not
come
the
cheers
were
feeble
it
was
evident
that
the
majority
of
those
present
did
not
know
how
to
meet
this
unexpected
contingency
it
had
taken
them
by
surprise
and
they
were
undecided
the
uproar
of
argument
and
question
began
again
louder
than
ever
the
bewildered
moderator
thumped
his
desk
and
shouted
feebly
for
order
tad
simpson
took
the
floor
and
in
a
few
words
and
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
nominated
alonzo
snow
abel
leonard
seconded
the
nomination
there
were
yells
of
question
question
and
vote
vote
eben
salters
was
recognized
by
the
chair
captain
salters
made
few
speeches
and
when
he
did
make
one
it
was
because
he
had
something
to
say
mr
moderator
he
said
i
for
one
hate
to
vote
just
now
it
that
the
school
committee
is
so
important
of
itself
but
i
do
think
that
the
rights
of
a
father
with
his
child
is
pretty
important
and
our
vote
for
whittaker
and
most
of
you
know
i
intended
votin
for
him
and
have
been
workin
for
him
might
seem
like
an
indorsement
of
his
position
this
whole
thing
is
a
big
surprise
to
me
i
do
feel
yet
that
we
know
enough
of
the
inside
facts
to
give
such
an
indorsement
like
to
see
this
thomas
man
before
i
decide
to
give
it
or
not
to
give
it
either
it
a
queer
thing
to
come
up
at
town
meetin
but
it
up
had
we
better
adjourn
until
next
week
he
sat
down
the
meeting
was
demoralized
some
were
shouting
for
adjournment
others
to
vote
it
a
straw
would
turn
the
scale
and
the
straw
was
forthcoming
while
captain
cy
was
speaking
the
door
had
silently
opened
and
two
men
entered
the
hall
and
sought
seclusion
in
a
corner
now
one
of
these
men
came
forward
the
honorable
heman
atkins
atkins
walked
solemnly
to
the
front
amidst
a
burst
of
recognition
many
of
the
voters
rose
to
receive
him
it
was
customary
when
the
great
man
condescended
to
attend
such
gatherings
to
offer
him
a
seat
on
the
platform
this
the
obsequious
knowles
proceeded
to
do
asaph
was
too
overcome
by
the
disclosure
of
john
smith
identity
and
by
simpson
attack
on
his
friend
to
remember
even
his
manners
he
did
not
rise
but
sat
stonily
staring
the
moderator
gavel
descended
order
he
roared
order
i
say
congressman
atkins
is
goin
to
talk
to
the
honorable
heman
faced
the
excited
crowd
one
hand
was
in
the
breast
of
his
frock
coat
the
other
was
clenched
upon
his
hip
he
stood
calm
benignant
dignified
the
incarnation
of
wisdom
and
righteous
worth
the
attitude
had
its
effect
the
applause
began
and
grew
to
an
ovation
men
who
had
intended
voting
against
his
favored
candidate
forgot
their
intention
in
the
magnetism
of
his
presence
and
cheered
he
bowed
and
bowed
again
fellow
townsmen
he
began
far
be
it
from
me
to
influence
your
choice
in
the
matter
of
the
school
committee
still
further
be
it
from
me
to
influence
you
against
an
old
boyhood
friend
a
neighbor
one
whom
i
believe
er
had
believed
to
be
all
that
was
sincere
and
true
but
fellow
townsmen
my
esteemed
friend
captain
salters
has
expressed
a
wish
to
see
thomas
the
father
whose
story
you
have
heard
i
happen
to
be
in
a
position
to
gratify
that
wish
thomas
will
you
kindly
come
forward
then
from
the
rear
of
the
hall
thomas
came
but
the
drunken
rowdy
of
the
night
before
had
been
transformed
gone
was
the
scrubby
beard
and
the
shabby
suit
shorn
was
the
unkempt
mop
of
hair
and
vanished
the
impudent
swagger
he
was
dressed
in
clean
linen
and
respectable
black
and
his
manner
was
modest
and
subdued
only
a
discoloration
of
one
eye
showed
where
captain
cy
blow
had
left
its
mark
he
stepped
upon
the
platform
beside
the
congressman
the
latter
laid
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
gentlemen
and
friends
said
heman
my
name
has
been
brought
into
this
controversy
by
simpson
directly
and
in
insinuation
by
er
another
therefore
it
is
my
right
to
make
my
position
clear
thomas
came
to
me
last
evening
in
distress
both
of
mind
and
body
he
told
me
his
story
substantially
the
story
which
has
just
been
told
to
you
by
simpson
and
gentlemen
i
believe
it
but
if
i
did
not
believe
it
if
i
believed
him
to
have
been
in
the
past
all
that
his
opponent
has
said
even
if
i
believed
that
only
last
evening
spurned
driven
from
his
child
penniless
and
hopeless
he
had
yielded
to
the
weakness
which
has
been
his
curse
all
his
life
even
if
i
believed
that
still
i
should
demand
that
henry
thomas
repentant
and
earnest
as
you
see
him
now
should
be
given
his
rightful
opportunity
to
become
a
man
again
he
is
poor
but
he
is
not
shall
not
be
friendless
no
a
thousand
times
no
you
may
say
some
of
you
that
the
affair
is
not
my
business
i
affirm
that
it
is
my
business
it
is
my
business
as
a
christian
and
that
business
should
come
before
all
others
i
have
not
allowed
sympathy
to
influence
me
if
that
were
the
case
my
regard
for
my
neighbor
and
friend
of
former
days
would
have
held
me
firm
but
gentlemen
i
have
a
child
of
my
own
i
know
what
a
father
love
is
as
only
a
father
can
know
it
and
after
a
sleepless
night
i
stand
here
before
you
determined
that
this
man
shall
have
his
own
if
my
money
which
you
will
i
sure
forgive
my
mentioning
and
my
unflinching
support
can
give
it
to
him
that
is
my
position
and
i
state
it
regardless
of
he
paused
and
with
raised
right
hand
like
the
picture
of
jove
in
the
old
academy
mythology
launched
his
final
thunderbolt
whom
god
hath
joined
he
proclaimed
let
no
one
put
asunder
that
settled
it
the
cheers
shook
the
walls
amidst
the
tumult
dimick
and
bailey
bangs
seized
captain
cy
by
the
shoulders
and
endeavored
to
lift
him
from
his
seat
for
the
love
of
goodness
whit
groaned
josiah
desperately
stand
up
and
answer
him
if
you
do
we
founder
the
captain
smiled
grimly
and
shook
his
head
he
had
not
taken
his
eyes
from
the
face
of
the
great
atkins
since
the
latter
began
speaking
what
he
replied
after
that
asunder
sockdolager
man
alive
do
you
want
me
to
add
sabbath
breakin
to
my
other
crimes
the
vote
by
ballot
followed
almost
immediately
it
was
pitiful
to
see
the
erstwhile
whittaker
majority
melt
away
alonzo
snow
was
triumphantly
elected
but
a
handful
voted
against
him
captain
cy
still
grimly
smiling
rose
and
left
the
hall
as
he
closed
the
door
he
heard
the
shrill
voice
of
uncle
bedny
demanding
justice
for
the
bassett
hollow
road
it
had
indeed
been
a
memoriable
town
meeting
chapter
xiii
the
repulse
when
deacon
zeb
clark
the
same
deacon
zeb
who
fell
into
the
cistern
as
narrated
by
captain
cy
made
his
first
visit
to
the
city
years
and
years
ago
he
stayed
but
two
days
as
he
had
proudly
boasted
that
he
should
remain
in
the
metropolis
at
least
a
week
our
people
were
much
surprised
at
his
premature
return
to
the
driver
of
the
butcher
cart
who
found
him
sitting
contentedly
before
his
dwelling
amidst
his
desolate
acres
the
nearest
neighbor
a
half
mile
away
did
deacon
zeb
disclose
his
reason
for
leaving
the
crowded
thoroughfares
there
was
so
many
folks
there
he
said
that
i
felt
and
captain
cy
returning
from
the
town
meeting
to
the
whittaker
place
felt
lonesome
likewise
not
for
the
deacon
reason
he
met
no
one
on
the
main
road
save
a
group
of
school
children
and
miss
phinney
and
sighting
the
latter
in
the
offing
he
dodged
behind
the
trees
by
the
schoolhouse
pond
and
waited
until
she
passed
but
the
captain
his
trouble
now
heavy
upon
him
did
feel
the
need
of
sympathy
and
congenial
companionship
he
knew
he
might
count
upon
dimick
and
asaph
and
whenever
keturah
supervision
could
be
evaded
upon
bangs
but
they
were
not
the
advisers
and
comforters
for
this
hour
of
need
all
the
rest
of
bayport
he
felt
sure
would
be
against
him
had
not
king
heman
the
great
from
the
steps
of
the
throne
banned
him
with
the
royal
displeasure
if
heman
ever
should
come
right
out
and
say
began
asaph
warning
well
strange
as
it
might
seem
heman
had
come
right
as
to
why
he
had
come
out
there
was
no
question
in
the
mind
of
the
captain
the
latter
had
left
thomas
the
prodigal
father
prostrate
and
blasphemous
in
the
road
the
previous
evening
his
next
view
of
him
was
when
transformed
and
sanctified
he
had
been
summoned
to
the
platform
by
atkins
no
doubt
he
had
returned
to
the
barber
shop
and
in
his
rage
and
under
simpson
cross
examination
had
revealed
something
of
the
truth
tad
the
politician
recognizing
opportunity
when
it
knocked
at
his
door
had
hurried
him
to
the
residence
the
rest
was
plain
enough
so
captain
cy
thought
however
war
was
already
declared
and
the
reasons
for
it
mattered
little
the
first
skirmish
might
occur
at
any
moment
the
situation
was
desperate
the
captain
squared
his
shoulders
thrust
forward
his
chin
and
walked
briskly
up
the
path
to
the
door
of
the
dining
room
it
was
nearly
one
but
had
not
yet
gone
she
was
waiting
to
the
very
last
minute
for
her
uncle
hello
shipmate
he
hailed
not
headed
for
school
yet
good
i
you
need
go

thinkin
of

team
and

uncle
the
captain
removed
his
coat
and
hat
and
pulled
a
chair
forward
to
the
table
hello
he
exclaimed
what
this
the
mail
smiled
delightedly
yes
sir
she
replied
i
knew
you
was
at
the
meeting
and
so
i
brought
it
from
the
office
ai
you
glad
sure
yes
indeed
much
obliged
tryin
to
keep
house
without
you
would
be
like
steerin
without
a
even
as
he
said
it
there
came
to
him
the
realization
that
he
might
have
to
steer
without
that
rudder
in
the
near
future
his
smile
vanished
he
smothered
a
groan
and
picked
up
the
mail
hum
he
mused
the
breeze
a
circular
and
one
letter
hello
it
is
possible
that
well
well
the
letter
was
in
a
long
envelope
he
hastily
tore
it
open
at
the
inclosure
he
glanced
in
evident
excitement
then
his
smile
returned
he
said
after
a
moment
reflection
i
guess
you
and
me
wo
have
to
go
to
ostable
after
noticing
the
child
look
of
disappointment
he
added
but

long
as

hey
little
girl
the
squall
likely
to

afore
night
he
muttered
half
aloud
we
enjoy
the
fine
weather
till
it
time
to
shorten
they
walked
all
that
afternoon
captain
cy
was
even
more
kind
and
gentle
with
his
small
companion
than
usual
he
told
her
stories
which
made
her
laugh
pointed
out
spots
in
the
pines
where
he
had
played
indian
when
a
boy
carried
her
pig
back
when
she
grew
tired
and
kissed
her
tenderly
when
at
the
back
door
of
the
whittaker
place
he
set
her
on
her
feet
again
had
a
good
time
dearie
he
asked

think
it

best
walk

cruises

when

a
big
girl
and
off
somewheres

i
never
forget
and
i
never
going
anywhere
without
it
was
after
five
as
they
entered
the
kitchen
anybody
been
here
while
i
was
out
asked
the
captain
of
georgianna
the
housekeeper
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
and
she
hugged
as
she
helped
her
off
with
her
jacket
and
hood
yes
there
has
was
the
decided
answer
first
ase
tidditt
and
then
bailey
bangs
and
then
that
that
angie
humph
mused
captain
cy
slowly
so
angie
was
here
was
she
where
the
carcass
is
the
vultures
are
on
deck
or
words
similar
humph
did
our
angelic
friend
have
much
to
say
did
she
and
had
somethin
to
say
too
i
never
in
my
life
humph
her
employer
eyed
her
sharply
so
and
so
soon
talk
about
the
telegraph
spreadin
news
i
back
most
any
half
dozen
tongues
in
bayport
to
spread
more
news
and
add
more
trimmin
to
it
in
a
day
than
the
telegraph
could
do
in
a
week
especially
if
all
the
telegraph
operators
was
like
the
one
up
at
the
depot
well
georgianna
when
you
goin
to
leave
leave
leave
where
what
are
you
talkin
about
leave
here
of
course
you
realize
that
this
ship
of
ours
indicating
the
house
by
a
comprehensive
wave
of
his
hand
around
the
room
is
to
be
a
mighty
unpopular
craft
from
now
on
we
may
be
on
a
lee
shore
any
minute
you
got
your
own
to
think
my
own
what
do
you
i
care
for
my
when
there
whittaker
you
tell
me
now
is
it
so
some
of
it
is
yes
he
come
back
and
he
who
he
says
he
is
seen
him
he
was
here
all
day
so
angie
said
but
i
could
scarcely
believe
it
that
toughy
whittaker
do
you
intend
to
hand
over
that
poor
little
innocent
thing
to
to
such
a
man
as
that
no
there
be
no
handin
over
about
it
but
the
odds
are
against
us
and
there
no
reason
why
you
should
be
in
the
rumpus
georgianna
you
may
not
understand
what
we
the
housekeeper
drew
herself
up
her
face
was
very
red
and
her
small
eyes
snapped
cy
whittaker
she
began
manners
and
deference
to
employer
alike
forgotten
do
you
say
no
more
of
that
wicked
foolishness
to
me
leave
the
minute
you
enough
to
let
that
child
go
and
not
afore
and
when
that
happens
i
be
glad
to
leave
land
sakes
there
somebody
at
the
door
and
i
expect
i
a
perfect
she
rubbed
her
face
with
her
apron
thereby
making
it
redder
than
ever
and
hurried
into
the
dining
room
said
captain
cy
quickly
you
stay
here
in
the
emmie
looked
at
him
in
surprised
bewilderment
but
she
suppressed
her
curiosity
concerning
the
identity
of
the
person
who
had
knocked
and
obeyed
the
captain
pulled
the
kitchen
door
almost
shut
and
listened
at
the
crack
the
first
spoken
words
by
the
visitor
appeared
to
relieve
captain
anxiety
but
they
seemed
to
astonish
him
greatly
why
he
exclaimed
in
a
whisper
ai
that
it
sounds
like
it
teacher
whispered
who
also
had
been
listening
come
to
find
out
why
i
was
at
school
you
tell
her
uncle
georgianna
returned
to
announce
it
miss
dawes
she
says
she
wants
to
see
you
she
in
the
settin
the
captain
drew
a
long
breath
then
repeating
his
command
to
emmie
to
stay
where
she
was
he
left
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
him
the
latter
procedure
roused
indignation
what
made
him
do
that
she
demanded
i
have
been
bad
he
never
shut
me
up
before
the
schoolmistress
was
standing
by
the
center
table
in
the
sitting
room
when
captain
cy
entered
good
evenin
he
said
politely
wo
you
sit
down
but
miss
dawes
paid
no
attention
to
trivialities
she
seemed
much
agitated
whittaker
she
began
i
just
heard
something
that
the
captain
interrupted
her
excuse
me
he
said
but
i
think
we
pull
down
the
curtains
and
have
a
little
light
on
the
subject
it
gets
dark
early
now
especially
of
a
gray
day
like
this
he
drew
the
shades
at
the
windows
and
lit
the
lamp
on
the
table
the
red
glow
behind
the
panes
of
the
stove
door
faded
into
insignificance
as
the
yellow
radiance
brightened
the
ugly
portraits
and
the
stiff
old
engravings
on
the
wall
retired
into
a
becoming
dusk
the
room
became
more
homelike
now
wo
you
sit
down
repeated
captain
cy
take
that
rocker
the
most
one
aboard
so
says
miss
phoebe
took
the
rocker
under
protest
her
host
remained
standing
it
been
a
nice
afternoon
he
said
emmie
of
course
and
i
have
been
for
a
walk
her
fault
was
mine
i
kept
her
out
of
school
i
was
well
kind
of
the
teacher
gray
eyes
flashed
in
the
lamplight
whittaker
she
cried
please
do
waste
time
i
did
come
here
to
talk
about
the
weather
nor
emily
reason
for
not
attending
school
i
do
care
why
she
was
absent
but
i
have
just
heard
of
what
happened
at
that
meeting
is
it
true
that
she
hesitated
that
emmie
dad
is
alive
and
here
yes
it
but
but
that
man
last
night
was
he
that
man
the
captain
nodded
that
the
man
he
said
briefly
miss
dawes
shuddered
whittaker
she
asked
earnestly
are
you
sure
he
is
really
her
father
absolutely
sure
sure
and
then
she
belongs
to
him
does
she
legally
i
mean
maybe
are
are
you
going
to
give
her
up
to
him
then
what
i
heard
was
true
you
did
say
at
the
meeting
that
you
were
going
to
do
your
best
to
keep
him
from
getting
um
hum
what
i
said
amounts
to
just
about
why
captain
cy
was
surprised
and
a
little
disappointed
apparently
why
he
repeated
yes
why
well
for
reasons
i
do
you
mind
telling
me
the
reasons
i
you
do
want
to
hear
if
you
do
understand
now
then
i
ca
make
it
much
plainer
i
the
little
lady
sprang
to
her
feet
oh
you
are
provoking
she
cried
indignantly
ca
you
see
that
i
want
to
hear
the
reasons
from
you
yourself
whittaker
i
shook
hands
with
you
last
you
remember
i
told
you
you
better
i
did
want
to
wait
i
believed
i
knew
something
of
human
nature
and
i
believed
i
had
learned
to
understand
you
i
made
up
my
mind
to
pay
no
more
attention
to
what
people
said
against
you
i
thought
they
were
envious
and
disliked
you
because
you
did
things
in
your
own
way
i
would
believe
the
stories
i
heard
this
afternoon
i
wanted
to
hear
you
speak
in
your
own
defense
and
you
refuse
to
do
it
do
you
know
what
people
are
saying
they
say
you
are
trying
to
keep
emily
because
oh
i
ashamed
to
ask
it
but
you
make
me
has
the
child
got
valuable
property
of
her
own
captain
cy
had
been
throughout
this
scene
standing
quietly
by
the
table
now
he
took
a
step
forward
miss
dawes
he
said
sharply
sit
but
i
sit
down
the
schoolmistress
did
mean
to
obey
the
order
but
for
some
reason
she
did
the
captain
went
on
speaking
it
pretty
plain
he
said
that
what
you
heard
at
the
house
for
i
suppose
that
where
you
did
hear
it
was
what
you
might
call
a
phinneyized
story
of
the
doin
at
the
meetin
well
another
yarn
and
it
mine
i
goin
to
spin
it
and
i
want
you
to
he
went
on
to
spin
his
yarn
it
was
practically
a
repetition
of
his
reply
to
tad
simpson
that
morning
its
conclusion
was
also
much
the
same
the
land
ai
worth
fifty
dollars
he
declared
but
if
it
was
fifty
million
he
should
have
it
why
because
it
belongs
to
that
little
girl
and
he
sha
have
her
until
he
and
those
back
of
him
have
hammered
me
through
the
courts
till
i
down
forty
fathom
under
water
and
when
they
do
get
her
and
to
be
honest
i
they
will
in
the
end
i
hope
to
god
i
wo
be
alive
to
see
it
there
i
answered
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
with
the
old
stride
his
hands
jammed
deep
in
his
pockets
and
his
face
working
with
emotion
it
pretty
nigh
a
fight
for
me
he
continued
but
fought
before
the
other
side
got
almost
all
the
powder
and
the
men
heman
and
tad
and
that
thomas
have
got
seven
eighths
of
bayport
behind
not
to
mention
the
they
so
sure
of
my
crowd
is
a
mighty
forlorn
hope
dimick
and
ase
tidditt
and
bailey
as
much
as
his
wife
let
him
oh
yes
and
he
smiled
whimsically
there
another
one
a
new
recruit
just
joined
enlisted
that
my
army
sort
of
cadets
we
are
small
potatoes
and
few
in
a
the
teacher
rose
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
he
turned
toward
her
the
lamplight
shone
upon
her
face
and
he
saw
to
his
astonishment
that
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
whittaker
she
said
will
you
take
an
other
recruit
i
should
like
to
enlist
you
oh
pshaw
i
i
did
see
the
joke
of
it
at
there
is
any
joke
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
admire
you
for
the
fight
you
making
law
or
no
law
to
let
that
dear
little
girl
go
away
with
that
dreadful
father
of
hers
is
a
sin
and
a
crime
i
came
here
to
tell
you
so
i
did
want
to
hear
your
story
and
you
made
me
ask
that
question
but
i
was
certain
of
your
answer
before
you
made
it
i
suppose
i
can
do
anything
to
help
but
i
going
to
try
so
you
see
your
army
is
bigger
than
you
thought
it
was
though
the
new
soldier
is
good
for
much
i
afraid
she
added
with
a
little
smile
captain
cy
was
greatly
disturbed
miss
phoebe
he
said
i
i
wo
say
that
it
do
please
me
to
have
you
talk
so
for
it
does
you
can
imagine
sympathy
means
somethin
to
the
under
dog
and
it
gives
him
spunk
to
keep
on
kickin
but
you
must
take
any
part
in
the
row
you
simply
must
it
why
not
wo
i
be
any
help
help
you
be
more
help
than
all
the
rest
of
us
put
together
you
and
me
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
each
other
and
my
part
in
the
few
talks
we
have
had
has
been
a
mean
one
but
i
knew
the
first
time
i
met
you
that
you
had
more
brains
and
common
sense
than
any
woman
in
this
county
though
i
was
too
to
own
it
but
that
ai
it
i
got
you
the
job
of
teacher
it
no
credit
to
me
was
just
bull
luck
and
for
the
fun
of
jarrin
heman
but
i
did
it
and
because
i
did
it
the
atkins
crowd
and
that
means
most
everybody
now
have
any
love
for
you
my
tryin
for
school
committee
was
really
just
to
give
you
a
fair
chance
in
your
position
i
was
licked
so
the
committee
two
to
one
against
you
do
you
see
that
you
must
have
anything
to
do
with
me
do
you
see
it
she
shook
her
head
i
see
that
common
gratitude
alone
should
be
reason
enough
for
my
trying
to
help
you
she
said
but
beside
that
i
know
you
are
right
and
i
shall
help
no
matter
what
you
say
as
for
the
teacher
position
let
them
discharge
me
i
do
talk
that
way
the
youngsters
need
you
and
know
it
no
matter
what
their
fool
fathers
and
mothers
say
and
you
must
wreck
your
chances
you
young
she
laughed
oh
no
i
not
she
said
young
whittaker
you
should
joke
about
a
woman
i
ai
jokin
you
are
as
she
stood
there
before
him
he
was
realizing
with
a
curiously
uncomfortable
feeling
how
much
younger
she
was
than
he
he
glanced
up
at
the
mirror
where
his
own
gray
hairs
were
reflected
and
repeated
his
assertion
you
young
yet
he
said
and
bein
discharged
from
a
place
might
mean
a
whole
lot
to
you
glad
you
take
such
an
interest
in
and
your
comin
here
on
her
account
he
paused
miss
dawes
colored
slightly
and
said
your
comin
here
on
her
account
was
mighty
good
of
you
but
you
got
to
keep
out
of
this
trouble
and
you
must
come
here
again
owner
orders
why
i
expectin
a
boardin
party
any
minute
he
added
i
thought
when
you
knocked
it
was
comin
for
his
child
you
better
but
she
stood
still
i
sha
go
she
declared
or
at
least
not
until
you
promise
to
let
me
try
to
help
you
if
they
come
so
much
the
better
they
learn
where
my
sympathies
captain
cy
scratched
his
head
see
here
miss
phoebe
he
said
i
ai
sure
that
you
fully
understand
that
scripture
and
everything
else
is
against
us
did
angie
turn
loose
on
you
the
the
lord
has
joined
avalanche
the
schoolmistress
burst
into
a
laugh
the
captain
laughed
too
but
his
gravity
quickly
returned
for
steps
sounded
on
the
walk
there
was
a
whispering
outside
and
some
one
knocked
on
the
door
the
situation
was
similar
to
that
of
the
evening
when
the
board
of
strategy
called
and
john
smith
made
his
first
appearance
but
now
oddly
enough
captain
cy
seemed
much
less
troubled
he
looked
at
miss
dawes
and
there
was
a
dancing
twinkle
in
his
eye
is
it
began
the
lady
in
an
agitated
whisper
the
boardin
party
i
presume
but
what
can
you
do
stand
by
the
repel
i
guess
was
the
calm
reply
i
told
you
that
they
had
most
of
the
ammunition
but
ours
ai
all
blank
cartridges
you
stay
below
and
listen
to
the
they
heard
georgianna
cross
the
dining
room
there
was
a
murmur
of
voices
at
the
door
the
captain
nodded
it
them
he
said
well
here

now

you
show
do
you
think
i
am
afraid
indeed
i
sha
stay

you
call
it

shall
let
them

captain
cy
held
up
his
hand
i
commodore
of
this
fleet
he
said
and
that

the
case
i
expect
my
crew

obey

do
and
why
yes
there

of
georgianna

the
housekeeper

looking
frightened
and
nervous

the
door

they
there
whispered
georgianna
mr
atkins
and
tad
and
that
thomas

and
lots
more
and
they
come
after
her
what

first

emily
came
running
miss
dawes
put
an
arm
about
her
captain
cy
the
battle
lanterns
still
twinkling
under
his
brows
stepped
forth
to
meet
the
boarding
they
were
there
as
georgianna
had
said
thomas
on
the
top
step
heman
and
simpson
on
the
next
lower
and
behind
them
abel
leonard
and
a
group
of
interested
volunteers
principally
recruited
from
the
back
room
of
the
barber
shop
evenin
gentlemen
said
the
captain
opening
the
door
so
briskly
that
thomas
started
backward
and
came
down
heavily
upon
the
toes
of
the
devoted
tad
simpson
swore
thomas
clawed
about
him
to
gain
equilibrium
and
the
dignity
of
the
group
was
seriously
impaired
evenin
repeated
captain
cy
quite
a
surprise
party
you
me
come
cyrus
began
the
honorable
atkins
we
are
here
to
claim
give
me
my
daughter
you
robber
demanded
thomas
from
his
new
position
in
the
rear
of
the
other
two
mr
thomas
said
heman
please
remember
that
i
am
conducting
this
affair
i
respect
the
natural
indignation
of
an
outraged
father
but
ahem
cyrus
we
are
here
to
claim
then
do
your
claimin
inside
it
kind
of
chilly
plenty
of
empty
chairs
and
we
do
need
to
hold
an
overflow
meetin
come
ahead
the
trio
looked
at
each
other
in
hesitation
then
atkins
majestically
entered
the
dining
room
thomas
and
simpson
followed
him
abe
observed
captain
cy
to
leonard
who
was
advancing
toward
the
steps
i
sorry
not
to
be
hospitable
but
there
too
many
of
you
to
invite
at
once
and
polite
to
show
partiality
you
and
the
rest
are
welcome
to
sit
on
the
terrace
or
stroll
the
deer
park
good
he
closed
the
door
in
the
face
of
the
disappointed
abel
and
turned
to
the
three
in
the
room
well
he
said
out
with
it
you
come
to
claim
somethin
i
i
come
for
my
rights
shouted
thomas
yes
well
this
ai
state
prison
or
i
give
to
you
with
pleasure
heman
you
better
do
the
talkin
we
probably
get
ahead
the
honorable
cleared
his
throat
and
waved
his
hand
cyrus
he
began
you
are
my
boyhood
friend
and
my
fellow
townsman
and
neighbor
under
such
circumstances
it
gives
me
pain
then
do
let
us
discuss
painful
subjects
let
get
down
to
business
you
come
to
rescue
emily
that
is
from
the
quotin
deacon
thomas
here
that
got
her
so
to
turn
her
over
to
her
sorrowin
father
is
that
it
yes
well
you
ca
have
her
not
cyrus
said
atkins
i
sorry
to
see
that
you
take
it
this
way
you
have
the
shadow
of
a
right
we
have
the
law
with
us
and
your
conduct
will
lead
us
to
invoke
it
the
constable
is
outside
shall
i
call
him
in
uncle
bedny
was
the
town
constable
and
had
been
since
before
the
war
the
purely
honorary
office
was
given
him
each
year
as
a
joke
captain
cy
grinned
broadly
and
even
tad
was
obliged
to
smile
do
be
inhuman
heman
urged
the
captain
you
would
turn
me
over
to
be
by
uncle
bedny
would
you
this
is
not
a
humorous
affair
began
the
congressman
with
dignity
but
the
bereaved
father
had
been
prospecting
on
his
own
hook
and
now
he
peeped
into
the
sitting
room
here
she
is
he
shouted
i
see
her
come
on
emmie
your
dad
come
for
you
let
go
of
her
you
woman
what
do
you
mean
by
holdin
on
to
her
the
situation
which
was
not
humorous
immediately
became
much
less
so
the
next
minute
was
a
lively
one
it
ended
as
thomas
was
picked
up
by
tad
from
the
floor
where
he
had
fallen
having
been
pushed
violently
over
a
chair
by
captain
cy
frightened
and
sobbing
was
clinging
wildly
to
miss
dawes
who
had
clung
just
as
firmly
to
her
the
voice
rang
through
the
room
that
enough
he
said
that
enough
and
some
over
atkins
take
that
feller
out
of
this
house
and
off
my
premises
as
for
the
girl
that
for
us
to
fight
out
in
the
courts
i
her
guardian
lawfully
appointed
and
you
nor
nobody
else
can
touch
her
while
that
appointment
good
here
it
is
right
here
now
look
at
it
and
clear
he
held
for
the
congressman
inspection
the
document
which
inclosed
in
the
long
envelope
had
been
received
that
morning
his
visit
to
ostable
made
some
weeks
before
had
been
for
the
purpose
of
applying
to
the
probate
court
for
the
appointment
as
emily
guardian
he
had
applied
before
the
news
of
her
father
coming
to
life
reached
him
the
appointment
itself
had
arrived
just
in
time
atkins
studied
the
document
with
care
when
he
spoke
it
was
with
considerable
agitation
and
without
his
usual
diplomacy
humph
he
grunted
humph
i
see
well
sir
i
have
some
influence
in
this
section
and
i
shall
see
how
long
your
your
trick
will
prevent
the
child
going
where
she
belongs
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
i
shall
continue
this
fight
to
the
very
last
i
i
am
not
one
to
be
easily
beaten
simpson
you
and
thomas
come
with
me
this
night
despicable
chicanery
is
only
the
beginning
this
is
bad
business
for
you
cy
whittaker
he
snarled
his
vanishing
and
with
a
vindictive
glance
at
the
schoolmistress
for
those
who
are
with
you
in
it
that
appointment
was
obtained
under
false
pretenses
and
i
can
prove
it
your
tricks
do
scare
me
i
had
experience
with
tricks
yup
so
i
heard
well
heman
i
ai
as
well
up
in
tricks
as
you
claim
to
be
nor
my
stockin
is
as
well
padded
as
yours
maybe
but
while
there
a
piece
left
in
the
toe
of
it
i
fight
you
and
the
skunk
whose
you
seem
to
have
taken
such
a
shine
to
and
after
that
while
there
a
lawyer
that
trust
me
and
meantime
that
little
girl
stays
right
here
and
you
touch
her
if
you
dare
any
of
you
anything
more
to
say
but
the
honorable
dignity
had
returned
possibly
he
thought
he
had
said
too
much
already
a
moment
later
the
door
banged
behind
the
discomforted
boarding
party
captain
cy
pulled
his
beard
and
laughed
well
we
repelled
did
we
he
observed
but
as
friend
heman
says
the
beginnin
only
begun
i
wish
he
had
seen
you
here
miss
dawes
looked
up
from
the
task
of
stroking
poor
hair
i
do
she
said
i
glad
of
then
she
added
laughing
nervously
whittaker
how
could
you
be
so
cool
it
was
like
a
play
i
declare
you
were
just
splendid
chapter
xiv
a
clew
josiah
dimick
has
a
unique
faculty
of
grasping
a
situation
and
summing
it
up
in
an
way
i
think
observed
josiah
to
the
excited
group
at
simmons
that
this
town
owes
cy
whittaker
a
vote
of
thanks
gasped
alpheus
smalley
so
shocked
and
horrified
that
he
put
the
weight
on
the
scales
instead
of
the
half
pound
thanks
after
what
we
found
out
well
i
must
say
drawled
captain
josiah
thanks
was
what
i
said
if
it
for
him
this
gang
and
the
sewin
circle
would
have
nothin
to
talk
about
but
their
neighbors
our
reputations
would
be
as
full
of
holes
as
a
skimmer
by
this
time
now
all
hands
are
so
busy
jumpin
on
whit
that
the
rest
of
us
can
feel
fairly
safe
ai
that
so
gabe
lumley
who
had
stopped
in
for
a
half
pound
of
tea
grinned
feebly
but
said
nothing
if
he
noticed
the
clerk
mistake
in
weights
he
mention
it
but
took
his
package
and
hurried
out
after
his
departure
smalley
himself
discovered
the
error
and
charged
the
lumley
account
with
lbs
mixed
green
and
meanwhile
the
assemblage
about
the
stove
had
put
captain
cy
on
the
anvil
and
was
hammering
him
vigorously
bayport
was
boiling
over
with
rumor
and
surmise
heman
had
appealed
to
the
courts
asking
that
captain
cy
appointment
as
guardian
be
rescinded
cy
had
hired
lawyer
peabody
of
ostable
to
look
out
for
his
interests
atkins
and
the
captain
had
all
but
come
to
blows
over
the
child
thomas
the
poor
father
had
broken
down
and
wept
and
had
threatened
to
commit
suicide
salters
had
refused
to
speak
to
captain
cy
when
she
met
the
latter
after
meeting
on
sunday
the
land
in
orham
had
been
sold
and
the
captain
was
using
the
money
phoebe
dawes
had
threatened
to
resign
if
came
to
school
any
longer
no
she
had
threatened
to
resign
if
she
did
come
to
school
she
had
threatened
to
resign
at
all
but
wanted
higher
wages
because
of
the
effect
the
scandal
might
have
on
her
reputation
as
a
teacher
these
were
a
few
of
the
reports
contradicted
and
added
to
from
day
to
day
to
quote
josiah
dimick
again
sortin
out
the
truth
from
the
lies
is
like
tryin
to
find
a
quart
of
sardines
in
a
schooner
load
of
herrin
and
they
dump
in
more
herrin
every
half
angeline
phinney
was
having
the
time
of
her
life
the
perfect
boarding
house
hummed
like
a
fly
trap
keturah
and
tripp
had
deserted
to
the
enemy
and
the
minority
meaning
asaph
and
bailey
had
little
opportunity
to
defend
their
friend
cause
even
if
they
had
dared
heman
atkins
his
christian
charity
and
his
devotion
to
duty
regardless
of
political
consequences
and
the
magnificent
speech
at
town
meeting
were
lauded
and
exalted
the
bayport
breeze
contained
a
full
account
of
the
meeting
and
it
was
read
aloud
by
keturah
amidst
hymns
of
praise
from
the
elect
the
lord
hath
joined
read
bangs
no
man
put
asunder
ai
that
splendid
ai
that
fine
the
paper
says
congressman
atkins
delivered
this
noble
sentiment
a
hush
fell
upon
the
excited
throng
i
should
think
i
remember
when
i
was
married
the
minister
said
pretty
nigh
the
same
thing
and
i
could
speak
i
could
have
opened
my
mouth
to
save
me
do
you
remember
i
could
bailey
bangs
nodded
gloomily
it
is
possible
that
he
wished
the
effect
of
the
minister
declaration
might
have
been
more
lasting
asaph
stirred
in
his
chair
i
do
care
he
said
this
puttin
asunder
business
is
all
right
but
there
always
two
sides
to
everything
i
see
this
thomas
critter
when
he
fust
come
and
he
did
look
like
no
saint
then
nor
smell
like
one
neither
unless
was
a
specimen
pickled
in
here
was
irreverence
almost
atheistic
keturah
face
showed
her
shocked
disapproval
matilda
tripp
voiced
the
general
sentiment
humph
she
sniffed
well
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
met
thomas
two
or
three
times
and
did
notice
anything
but
politeness
and
good
manners
maybe
my
nose
ai
so
fine
for
smellin
liquor
as
some
folks
it
ai
had
the
experience
but
all
saw
was
a
poor
lame
man
with
a
black
eye
i
pitied
him
and
i
do
care
who
hears
me
say
yes
concurred
miss
phinney
and
if
he
was
a
drinkin
man
do
you
suppose
atkins
would
have
anything
to
do
with
him
cyrus
whittaker
made
a
whole
lot
of
talk
about
his
insultin
some
woman
or
other
but
nobody
knows
who
the
woman
was
time
for
her
to
speak
up
i
should
think
teacher
turning
to
miss
dawes
you
was
at
the
whittaker
place
when
atkins
and
emily
father
come
for
her
i
understand
i
wish
i
have
been
there
it
must
have
been
wuth
it
was
replied
miss
dawes
she
had
kept
silent
throughout
the
various
discussions
of
the
week
following
the
town
meeting
but
now
thus
appealed
to
she
answered
promptly
angeline
news
created
a
sensation
the
schoolmistress
immediately
became
the
center
of
interest
is
that
so
was
you
there
teacher
well
i
declare
the
questions
and
exclamations
flew
round
the
table
tell
us
teacher
pleaded
keturah
was
heman
grand
i
should
so
like
to
have
heard
him
did
whittaker
look
ashamed
of
himself
no
he
did
not
if
anyone
looked
ashamed
it
was
atkins
and
his
friends
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
my
sympathies
are
entirely
with
captain
whittaker
in
this
affair
to
give
that
little
girl
up
to
a
drunken
scoundrel
like
her
father
would
in
my
opinion
be
a
the
boarders
and
the
landlady
gasped
asaph
grinned
and
nudged
bailey
under
the
table
keturah
was
the
first
to
recover
well
she
exclaimed
everybody
got
a
right
to
their
opinion
of
course
but
i
ca
see
the
crime
myself
and
as
for
the
drunkenness
i
like
to
know
who
seen
thomas
drunk
cyrus
whittaker
says
he
has
but
she
waved
her
hand
scornfully
phoebe
rose
from
her
chair
i
have
seen
him
in
that
condition
she
said
in
fact
i
am
the
person
he
insulted
i
saw
captain
whittaker
knock
him
down
and
i
honored
the
captain
for
it
i
only
wished
i
were
a
man
and
could
have
done
it
she
left
the
room
and
a
few
moments
later
the
house
tidditt
chuckled
aloud
even
bailey
dared
to
look
pleased
there
sneered
the
widow
tripp
ai
that
perhaps
you
remember
that
whittaker
got
her
the
teacher
place
yes
put
in
miss
phinney
and
nobody
knows
why
he
got
it
for
her
that
is
nobody
has
known
up
to
now
maybe
we
can
begin
to
guess
a
little
after
she
was
at
his
house
was
she
observed
keturah
humph
i
wonder
why
seems
to
me
if
was
a
young
that
is
a
single
woman
like
her
be
kind
of
careful
about
callin
on
bachelors
humph
it
looks
funny
to
asaph
rose
and
pushed
back
his
chair
i
she
called
to
see
emily
he
said
sharply
the
child
was
her
scholar
and
i
presume
likely
knowin
the
kind
of
father
that
has
turned
up
for
the
poor
young
one
she
felt
sorry
for
her
of
course
nobody
hintin
anything
against
phoebe
dawes
character
if
you
want
a
certificate
of
that
you
only
got
to
go
to
wellmouth
folks
over
there
are
pretty
keen
on
that
subject
i
guess
the
town
would
go
to
law
about
it
hear
a
word
against
her
libel
suits
are
kind
of
things
for
them
that
ai
sure
of
their
facts
i
hate
to
get
mixed
up
in
one
myself
bailey
i
going
up
street
come
on
when
you
can
wo
you
as
if
frightened
at
his
own
display
of
spirit
he
hurried
out
there
was
silence
for
a
time
then
miss
phinney
spoke
concerning
the
weather
up
at
the
cy
whittaker
place
the
days
were
full
ones
there
also
legal
questions
were
discussed
with
georgianna
the
board
of
strategy
josiah
dimick
occasionally
and
more
infrequently
still
miss
dawes
as
participants
with
captain
cy
in
the
discussions
rumors
were
true
in
so
far
as
they
related
to
atkins
appeal
to
the
courts
and
the
captain
retaining
lawyer
peabody
of
ostable
peabody
opinion
of
the
case
was
not
encouraging
you
see
captain
he
said
when
his
client
visited
him
at
his
office
the
odds
are
very
much
against
us
the
court
appointed
you
as
guardian
with
the
understanding
that
this
man
thomas
was
dead
now
he
is
alive
and
claims
his
child
more
than
that
he
has
the
most
influential
politician
in
this
county
back
of
him
we
would
stand
a
fighting
chance
except
for
one
thing
thomas
himself
he
left
his
wife
and
the
baby
deserted
them
so
she
said
went
to
get
work
he
says
we
can
prove
he
was
a
drunken
blackguard
before
he
went
and
that
he
has
been
drunk
since
he
came
back
but
they
say
atkins
and
his
lawyer
that
the
man
was
desperate
and
despairing
because
of
your
refusal
to
give
him
his
child
they
hold
him
up
as
a
repentant
sinner
anxious
to
reform
and
needing
the
little
girl
influence
to
help
keep
him
straight
that
their
game
and
they
play
it
be
sure
of
that
it
sounds
reasonable
enough
too
for
sinners
have
repented
before
now
and
the
father
coming
back
to
his
child
is
the
one
sure
thing
to
win
applause
from
the
gallery
you
know
captain
cy
nodded
yup
he
said
i
know
it
the
other
night
when
miss
ph
when
a
friend
of
mine
was
at
the
house
she
said
this
business
was
like
a
play
i
did
say
so
to
her
but
all
the
same
i
realize
it
ai
like
a
play
at
all
in
a
play
dad
comes
home
havin
been
snaked
bodily
out
of
the
jaws
of
the
tomb
by
his
coat
collar
and
the
young
one
sings
out
papa
and
he
sobs
child
me
child
and
it
all
lovely
and
you
put
on
your
hat
feelin
that
the
old
man
is
goin
to
be
rich
and
righteous
for
the
rest
of
his
days
but
here
it
different
dad
a
rascal
and
anybody
who
seen
anything
of
the
world
knows
he
bound
to
stay
so
and
as
for
the
poor
little
girl
why
why
he
stopped
rose
and
striding
over
to
the
window
stood
looking
out
after
an
interval
during
which
the
attorney
read
a
dull
business
letter
through
for
the
second
time
he
spoke
again
i
hope
you
understand
peabody
he
said
it
ai
just
selfishness
that
makes
me
steer
the
course
i
runnin
course
got
to
be
the
world
and
all
to
me
and
if
she
taken
away
i
do
know
i
care
a
tinker
darn
what
happens
afterwards
but
all
the
same
if
her
dad
was
a
real
man
sorry
for
what
he
done
and
tryin
to
make
up
for
it
why
then
i
i
decent
enough
to
take
off
my
hat
hand
her
over
and
say
bless
you
and
good
luck
but
to
think
of
him
carryin
her
off
the
lord
knows
where
to
neglect
her
and
cruelize
her
and
to
let
her
grow
up
among
fellers
like
him
i
i
by
the
big
dipper
i
ca
do
it
that
all
i
ca
how
does
she
feel
about
it
herself
asked
peabody
her
why
that
the
hardest
of
all
some
of
the
children
at
school
pester
her
about
her
father
i
do
know
you
can
blame
young
ones
are
made
that
way
i
guess
but
she
comes
home
to
me
cryin
and
it
uncle
cy
he
ai
my
truly
father
is
he
and
let
him
take
me
away
from
you
will
you
till
it
seems
as
if
i
should
fly
out
of
the
window
the
poor
little
thing
and
that
humbug
atkins
blowin
about
his
christianity
and
all
d
n
such
christianity
as
that
i
say
i
seen
heathen
injuns
who
never
heard
of
christ
with
more
of
his
spirit
inside
there
i
shocked
you
i
guess
sometimes
i
think
this
place
is
too
narrer
and
cramped
for
me
i
been
around
you
know
and
my
new
england
bringin
up
has
wore
thin
in
spots
seem
if
i
must
get
somewheres
and
spread
out
or
i
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
the
lawyer
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
there
there
captain
he
said
do
yet
awhile
do
give
up
the
ship
if
we
lose
in
one
court
we
can
appeal
to
another
and
so
on
up
the
line
and
meantime
we
do
a
little
investigating
of
friend
thomas
career
since
he
left
concord
i
written
to
a
legal
acquaintance
of
mine
in
butte
giving
him
the
facts
as
we
know
them
and
a
description
of
thomas
he
will
try
to
find
out
what
the
fellow
did
in
his
years
out
west
it
our
best
chance
as
i
told
you
keep
your
pluck
up
and
wait
and
the
captain
repeated
this
conversation
to
the
board
of
strategy
when
he
returned
to
bayport
miss
dawes
had
walked
home
from
school
with
and
had
stopped
at
the
house
to
hear
the
report
she
listened
but
it
was
evident
that
something
else
was
on
her
mind
captain
whittaker
she
asked
has
it
ever
struck
you
as
queer
that
atkins
should
take
such
an
interest
in
this
matter
he
is
giving
time
and
counsel
and
money
to
help
this
man
thomas
who
is
a
perfect
stranger
to
him
why
does
he
do
it
captain
cy
smiled
why
he
repeated
why
to
down
me
of
course
i
was
gettin
too
everlastin
prominent
in
politics
to
suit
him
i
got
you
in
as
teacher
and
i
had
snow
as
good
as
licked
for
school
committee
goodness
knows
what
i
might
have
run
for
next
to
reasonin
and
i
simply
had
to
be
smashed
it
worked
all
right
i
so
unhealthy
now
in
the
sight
of
most
folks
in
this
town
that
i
they
go
home
and
their
clothes
after
they
meet
me
not
to
catch
my
but
the
teacher
shook
her
head
that
does
seem
reason
enough
to
me
she
declared
just
see
what
atkins
has
done
he
never
openly
advocated
anything
in
town
meeting
before
you
said
so
yourself
even
when
he
must
have
realized
that
you
had
the
votes
for
committeeman
he
kept
still
he
might
have
taken
many
of
them
from
you
by
simply
coming
out
and
declaring
for
mr
snow
but
he
did
and
then
all
at
once
he
takes
this
astonishing
stand
captain
whittaker
tidditt
says
that
the
night
of
emily
birthday
party
you
and
he
told
who
she
was
by
accident
and
that
atkins
seemed
very
much
surprised
and
upset
is
that
so
captain
cy
laughed
his
lemonade
was
upset
that
all
i
noticed
special
oh
yes
and
he
lost
his
hat
off
goin
home
but
what
of
it
what
are
you
drivin
at
i
was
wondering
if
if
it
could
be
that
for
some
reason
atkins
had
a
spite
against
emily
or
her
people
or
if
he
had
any
reason
to
fear
fear
fear
oh
my
that
funny
you
been
readin
novels
teacher
i
did
suspect
it
of
he
laughed
heartily
miss
dawes
smiled
too
but
she
still
persisted
well
she
said
i
do
know
perhaps
it
is
because
i
a
woman
and
politics
do
mean
as
much
to
me
as
to
you
men
but
to
me
political
reasons
do
seem
strong
enough
to
account
for
such
actions
as
those
of
atkins
emily
mother
was
a
thayer
was
she
and
the
thayers
once
lived
in
orham
i
wish
we
could
find
out
more
about
them
while
they
lived
asaph
tidditt
pulled
his
beard
thoughtfully
well
he
observed
maybe
we
can
if
we
want
to
though
i
do
think
what
we
find
out
amount
to
nothin
i
was
kind
of
to
go
to
orham
next
week
on
a
little
visit
seth
wingate
over
there
barzilla
wingate
cousin
whit
is
a
sort
of
relation
of
mine
and
we
visit
back
and
forth
every
nine
or
ten
year
or
so
the
ten
year
most
up
and
been
pesterin
me
to
come
over
seth
been
orham
town
clerk
about
as
long
as
i
been
the
bayport
one
and
he
lived
there
all
his
life
what
he
do
know
about
orham
folks
ai
wuth
knowin
if
you
say
so
i
pump
him
about
the
thayers
and
the
richards
do
no
harm
and
the
old
fool
likes
to
talk
anyhow
i
do
know
i
ought
to
speak
that
way
about
my
relations
he
added
doubtfully
but
seth
is
sort
of
stubborn
and
unlikely
at
odd
times
we
do
always
agree
as
to
which
is
the
best
town
to
live
in
you
so
it
was
settled
that
wingate
should
be
subjected
to
the
pumping
process
when
asaph
visited
him
he
departed
for
this
visit
the
following
week
and
remained
away
for
ten
days
meanwhile
several
things
happened
in
bayport
one
of
these
things
was
the
farewell
of
the
honorable
heman
atkins
congress
was
to
open
at
washington
and
the
honorable
heeded
the
call
of
duty
alicia
and
the
housekeeper
went
with
him
and
the
big
house
was
closed
for
the
winter
at
the
gate
between
the
stone
urns
and
backed
by
the
iron
dogs
the
great
man
bade
a
group
of
admiring
constituents
he
thanked
them
for
their
trust
in
him
and
promised
that
it
should
not
be
betrayed
i
leave
you
my
fellow
townsmen
er
ladies
and
friends
he
said
with
regret
tempered
by
pride
a
not
inexcusable
pride
i
believe
in
the
trying
experience
which
my
and
sympathy
has
so
recently
forced
upon
me
you
have
stood
firm
and
cheered
me
on
the
task
i
have
undertaken
the
task
of
restoring
to
a
worthy
man
his
own
shall
be
carried
on
to
the
bitterest
extremity
i
have
put
my
hand
to
the
plow
and
it
shall
not
be
withdrawn
and
furthermore
i
go
to
my
work
at
washington
determined
to
secure
for
my
native
town
the
appropriation
which
it
so
sorely
needs
i
shall
secure
it
if
i
can
even
though
and
the
sarcasm
was
hugely
enjoyed
by
his
listeners
i
am
as
i
seem
likely
to
be
deprived
of
the
help
of
the
at
our
recent
town
meeting
if
i
fail
and
i
do
not
conceal
the
fact
that
i
may
fail
i
am
certain
you
will
not
blame
me
now
i
should
like
to
shake
each
one
of
you
by
the
the
hands
were
shaken
and
the
train
bore
the
atkins
delegation
away
and
on
the
day
following
thomas
the
prodigal
father
also
left
town
a
position
in
boston
had
been
offered
him
he
said
and
he
felt
that
he
must
accept
it
he
would
come
back
some
of
these
days
with
the
warrant
from
the
court
and
get
his
little
girl
position
offered
him
um
quoth
dimick
the
cynical
in
conversation
with
captain
cy
inspector
of
sidewalks
i
wonder
well
please
do
ask
me
if
i
think
heman
sent
him
to
boston
so
to
have
him
out
of
the
way
and
he
feel
safer
than
if
he
was
loose
down
here
do
ask
me
that
for
with
my
strict
scruples
against
the
truth
i
might
say
no
as
it
is
i
say
nothin
and
wink
my
port
the
visit
ended
tidditt
returned
to
bayport
on
the
afternoon
of
his
return
he
and
bailey
called
at
the
whittaker
place
and
there
they
were
joined
by
miss
dawes
who
had
been
summoned
to
the
conclave
by
a
note
intrusted
to
now
ase
ordered
captain
cy
as
the
quartet
gathered
in
the
sitting
room
here
we
are
hangin
on
your
words
as
the
feller
said
keep
us
strung
up
too
long
what
did
you
find
out
the
town
clerk
cleared
his
throat
when
he
spoke
there
was
a
trace
of
disappointment
in
his
tone
to
have
been
able
to
electrify
his
audience
with
the
news
of
some
startling
discovery
would
have
been
pure
joy
for
asaph
well
he
began
i
do
know
i
found
out
anything
much
yet
i
did
find
out
somethin
too
but
it
do
really
amount
to
nothin
i
hoped
be
somethin
was
but
when
nothin
come
of
it
except
the
little
somethin
it
begun
with
i
for
the
land
sakes
snapped
bailey
bangs
who
was
a
trifle
envious
of
his
friend
position
in
the
center
of
the
stage
stop
them
and
wo
you
you
keep
whirlin
round
and
over
and
over
till
my
head
full
of
and
that
what
it
full
of
most
of
the
time
interrupted
asaph
tartly
captain
cy
hastened
to
act
as
peacemaker
never
mind
bailey
he
said
you
let
ase
alone
tell
us
what
you
did
find
out
ase
and
cut
out
the
well
continued
tidditt
with
a
glare
at
bangs
i
asked
seth
about
the
thayers
and
the
richards
folks
the
very
fust
night
i
struck
orham
he
remembered
of
course
he
can
remember
adam
if
you
let
him
tell
it
he
told
me
a
whole
mess
about
old
man
thayer
and
old
man
richards
and
their
granddads
and
grandmarms
and
what
houses
they
lived
in
and
how
many
hens
they
kept
and
what
their
dog
name
was
and
how
they
come
to
name
him
that
and
enough
more
to
fill
a
hogshead
was
ten
afore
he
got
out
of
genesis
and
down
so
fur
as
john
and
emily
he
remembered
their
bein
married
and
their
baby
mary
thayer
ma
bein
born
folks
used
to
call
john
thayer
a
smart
young
feller
so
seth
said
they
used
to
that
he
rise
high
in
the
seafarin
and
line
maybe
he
would
only
he
died
somewheres
in
californy
in
or
thereabouts
was
the
time
of
the
gold
craziness
out
there
and
he
left
his
ship
and
went
gold
huntin
and
the
next
thing
they
knew
he
was
dead
and
when
was
that
inquired
the
schoolmistress
in
i
tell
you
so
seth
what
ship
was
he
on
asked
bailey
wa
on
any
ship
why
do
you
listen
instead
of
settin
there
moonin
he
was
gold
diggin
i
tell
he
been
on
a
ship
had
he
what
was
the
name
of
her
i
did
ask
what
does
that
make
was
atkins
at
sea
in
those
days
put
in
the
teacher
the
captain
answered
her
yes
he
was
he
said
that
is
i
think
he
was
he
was
away
from
here
when
i
skipped
out
and
he
did
get
back
till
or
well
anyhow
went
on
asaph
that
all
i
could
find
out
seth
and
me
went
rummagin
through
town
records
from
way
back
to
glory
him
away
and
stringin
along
about
this
old
settler
and
that
till
i
wished
he
choke
himself
with
the
dust
he
was
raisin
we
found
grandad
will
and
emily
dad
will
and
john
own
will
and
all
john
left
everything
he
had
and
all
he
might
become
possessed
of
to
his
wife
and
baby
and
their
heirs
forever
he
died
poverty
what
the
use
of
a
will
when
you
ai
got
nothin
to
leave
why
exclaimed
captain
cy
the
answer
to
that
easy
john
was
to
sea
and
likely
intended
to
have
a
shy
at
the
diggin
afore
he
got
back
so
if
he
did
make
any
money
he
wanted
his
wife
and
baby
to
have
well
what
they
got
wa
wuth
havin
emily
had
to
scrimp
along
and
do
dressmakin
till
she
died
she
done
fairly
well
at
that
though
and
saved
somethin
and
passed
it
over
to
mary
and
mary
married
henry
thomas
after
she
went
with
the
howes
tribe
to
concord
and
he
got
rid
of
it
for
her
in
double
quick
time
all
but
the
orham
so
that
was
all
you
could
find
out
hey
ase
asked
the
captain
well
it
at
least
as
much
as
i
expected
you
see
teacher
these
notions
do
work
out
when
it
comes
to
real
miss
dawes
was
plainly
disappointed
i
wish
we
knew
more
she
said
who
was
on
this
ship
with
thayer
and
who
sent
the
news
of
his
death
home

red
friend
of

bailey
here
if

anybody
one
of
his
pets
she
was
for
a
spell
a

for
her

that
deef
idiot
debby
beasley
cy
that

was
her
name
was
briggs
afore

let
that
worry
you
are
you
going
to
see
her
captain
whittaker
asked
phoebe
the
captain
shook
his
head
why
no
i
guess
not
he
said
i
do
take
much
stock
in
what
be
likely
to
know
besides
i
a
good
deal
like
ase
i
had
about
all
the
debby
beasley
i
chapter
xv
debby
beasley
to
the
rescue
mrs
bangs
said
the
schoolmistress
as
if
it
was
the
most
casual
thing
in
the
world
i
want
to
borrow
your
husband
it
was
friday
evening
and
supper
at
the
perfect
boarding
house
had
advanced
as
far
as
the
stewed
prunes
and
stage
keturah
who
was
carefully
dealing
out
the
prunes
exactly
four
to
each
saucer
stopped
short
spoon
in
air
and
gazed
at
miss
dawes
you
you
want
to
what
she
asked
i
want
to
borrow
your
husband
i
want
him
all
day
too
because
thinking
of
driving
over
to
trumet
and
i
need
a
coachman
you
go
wo
you
bangs
bailey
who
had
been
considering
the
advisability
of
asking
for
a
second
cup
of
tea
brightened
up
and
looked
pleased
why
yes
he
answered
i
go
i
can
go
just
as
well
as
not
fact
is
i
like
to
ai
been
to
trumet
i
do
know
miss
phinney
and
the
widow
tripp
looked
at
each
other
then
they
both
looked
at
keturah
that
lady
mouth
closed
tightly
and
she
resumed
her
prune
distribution
i
sorry
she
said
crisply
but
i
he
ca
go
saturday
and
i
need
him
round
the
house
do
you
care
for
cake
elviry
i
it
pretty
dry
i
ai
had
time
to
do
much
bakin
this
of
course
continued
the
smiling
phoebe
i
should
think
of
asking
him
to
go
for
nothing
i
did
mean
borrow
him
in
just
that
way
i
was
thinking
of
hiring
your
horse
and
buggy
and
as
i
not
used
to
driving
i
thought
perhaps
i
might
engage
bangs
to
drive
for
me
i
expected
to
pay
for
the
privilege
but
as
you
need
him
i
suppose
i
must
get
my
rig
and
driver
somewhere
else
i
so
the
landlady
expression
changed
this
was
the
dull
season
and
opportunities
to
let
the
family
steed
and
buggy
horse
and
team
we
call
it
in
bayport
were
few
well
she
observed
i
do
want
to
be
unlikely
and
disobligin
far
he
concerned
he
rather
be
traipsin
round
the
country
than
stay
to
home
any
day
though
it
been
so
long
sence
he
took
me
to
ride
that
i
do
know
i
know
how
to
why
ketury
protested
her
husband
how
you
talk
did
i
drive
you
down
to
the
graveyard
only
last
sunday
or
the
sunday
afore
graveyard
yes
i
notice
our
rides
always
fetch
up
at
the
graveyard
you
always
willin
to
take
me
there
seems
sometimes
as
if
you
enjoyed
doin
now
keturah
you
know
yourself
that
was
you
proposed
goin
there
you
said
you
wanted
to
look
at
our
lot
you
was
afraid
big
enough
and
you
did
know
but
we
ought
to
add
on
another
piece
you
said
that
it
kept
you
awake
nights
worryin
for
fear
when
i
passed
away
you
would
have
room
in
that
lot
for
me
land
sakes
do
i
remember
did
you
give
me
the
blue
creeps
talkin
about
it
bangs
ignored
this
outburst
turning
to
the
school
teacher
she
said
with
a
sigh
well
i
guess
he
can
go
i
get
along
somehow
i
hope
he
be
careful
of
the
buggy
we
had
it
painted
only
last
tripp
ventured
a
hinted
question
concerning
the
teacher
errand
at
trumet
the
reply
being
noncommittal
the
widow
cheerfully
prophesied
that
she
guessed
was
going
to
rain
or
snow
next
day
it
about
time
for
the
line
storm
she
added
but
it
did
not
storm
although
a
brisk
cold
gale
was
blowing
when
after
breakfast
next
morning
the
horse
and
team
with
bailey
in
his
sunday
suit
and
overcoat
and
miss
dawes
on
the
buggy
seat
beside
him
turned
out
of
the
yard
and
started
on
the
journey
to
trumet
it
was
a
bleak
ride
denboro
the
village
adjoining
bayport
on
the
bay
side
is
a
pretty
place
with
old
elms
and
silverleafs
shading
the
main
street
in
summer
and
with
substantial
houses
set
each
in
its
trim
yard
but
beyond
denboro
the
trumet
road
winds
out
over
rolling
bare
hills
with
cranberry
bogs
now
flooded
and
skimmed
with
ice
in
the
hollows
between
them
clumps
of
bayberry
and
bushes
scattered
over
their
rounded
slopes
and
white
scars
in
their
sides
showing
where
the
cranberry
growers
have
cut
away
the
thin
layer
of
coarse
grass
and
moss
to
reach
the
sand
beneath
sand
which
they
use
in
preparing
their
bogs
for
the
new
vines
and
the
wind
there
is
always
a
breeze
along
the
trumet
road
even
in
summer
when
the
mosquitoes
lie
in
wait
to
leeward
like
buccaneers
until
sighting
the
luckless
wayfarer
in
the
offing
they
drive
down
before
the
wind
in
clouds
literally
to
eat
him
alive
they
are
skilled
navigators
those
trumet
road
mosquitoes
and
they
know
the
advantage
of
snug
harbors
under
hat
brims
and
behind
spreading
ears
and
each
individual
smashed
by
a
frantic
palm
leaves
a
thousand
blood
relatives
to
attend
his
funeral
and
exact
revenge
after
the
corsican
fashion
now
in
december
there
were
of
course
no
mosquitoes
but
the
wind
tore
across
those
bare
hilltops
in
gusts
that
rocked
the
buggy
on
its
springs
the
bayberry
bushes
huddled
and
crouched
before
it
the
sky
was
covered
with
tumbling
flying
clouds
which
changed
shape
continually
and
ripped
into
long
fleecy
ravelings
that
broke
loose
and
pelted
on
until
merged
into
the
next
billowy
mass
the
bay
was
gray
and
white
and
in
the
spots
where
an
occasional
sunbeam
broke
through
and
struck
it
flashed
like
a
turned
knife
blade
bailey
drove
with
one
hand
and
held
his
hat
on
his
head
with
the
other
the
road
had
been
deeply
rutted
during
the
november
rains
and
now
the
ruts
were
frozen
the
buggy
wheels
twisted
and
scraped
as
they
turned
in
the
furrows
what
the
matter
asked
the
schoolmistress
shouting
so
as
to
be
heard
above
the
flapping
of
the
buggy
curtains
why
do
you
watch
that
wheel
of
the
axle
whooped
bangs
in
reply
nut
kind
of
loose
for
one
thing
and
the
way
the
wheel
wobbles
i
scart
she
come
off
call
this
a
road
he
snorted
indignantly
more
like
a
plowed
field
a
sight
jerushy
how
she
blows
no
wonder
they
raise
so
many
deef
and
dumb
folks
in
trumet
i
talk
sign
language
myself
if
i
lived
here
what
the
use
of
wastin
strength
pumpin
up
words
when
blowed
back
down
your
throat
fast
enough
to
choke
you
git
dap
henry
do
you
see
the
meetin
house
steeple
we
most
there
thank
the
in
trumet
center
which
is
not
much
of
a
center
miss
dawes
alighted
from
the
buggy
and
entered
a
building
bearing
a
sign
with
the
words
metropolitan
variety
store
joshua
atwood
groceries
coal
dry
goods
insurance
boots
and
shoes
garden
seeds
a
smaller
sign
beneath
this
was
lettered
justice
of
the
peace
and
one
below
that
read
post
she
emerged
a
moment
later
followed
by
an
elderly
person
in
a
red
cardigan
jacket
and
overalls
take
the
fust
turnin
to
the
left
marm
he
said
pointing
pretty
nigh
to
east
trumet
townhall
fust
house
this
side
of
the
blacksmith
shop
about
two
mile
i
say
windy
day
for
drivin
it
that
horse
of
yours
belongs
in
bayport
i
looks
to
me
like
hello
bailey
hello
josh
grunted
bangs
adding
an
explanatory
aside
to
the
effect
that
he
knew
josh
atwood
the
latter
having
once
lived
in
bayport
but
say
he
asked
as
they
moved
on
once
more
have
we
got
to
go
to
east
trumet
jerushy
that
the
place
where
the
wind
comes
from
they
raise
it
over
there
anyhow
they
do
raise
much
else
whose
house
you
goin
to
he
had
asked
the
same
question
at
least
ten
times
since
leaving
home
and
each
time
miss
dawes
had
evaded
it
she
did
so
now
saying
that
she
was
sure
she
should
know
the
house
when
they
got
to
it
the
two
miles
to
east
trumet
were
worse
than
the
twelve
which
they
had
come
the
wind
fairly
shrieked
here
for
the
road
paralleled
the
edge
of
high
sand
bluffs
close
by
the
shore
and
the
ruts
and
were
trying
to
the
temper
bailey
was
completely
wrecked
teacher
he
snapped
as
they
reached
the
crest
of
a
long
hill
and
a
quick
grab
at
his
hat
alone
prevented
its
starting
on
a
balloon
ascension
get
out
a
spell
will
you
i
got
to
swear
or
bust
and
you
aboard
i
ca
swear
what
you
standin
still
for
you
he
bellowed
at
poor
henry
the
horse
who
had
stopped
to
rest
i
the
critter
thinks
that
last
cyclone
must
have
blowed
me
sky
high
and
he
waitin
to
see
where
i
light
git
dap
i
guess
i
shall
get
out
very
soon
now
panted
phoebe
there
the
blacksmith
shop
over
there
near
the
next
hill
and
this
house
in
the
hollow
must
be
the
one
i
looking
they
pulled
up
beside
the
house
in
the
hollow
a
little
house
it
was
and
judging
by
the
neglected
appearance
of
the
weeds
and
bushes
in
the
yard
it
had
been
unoccupied
for
some
time
however
the
blinds
were
now
open
and
a
few
fowls
about
the
back
door
seemed
to
promise
that
some
one
was
living
there
the
wooden
letter
box
by
the
gate
had
a
name
stenciled
upon
it
miss
dawes
sprang
from
the
buggy
and
looked
at
the
box
yes
she
said
this
is
the
place
will
you
come
in
bangs
you
can
put
your
horse
in
that
barn
i
sure
if
you
want
but
bailey
declined
to
come
in
he
declared
he
was
going
on
to
the
blacksmith
shop
to
have
that
wheel
fixed
he
would
not
feel
safe
to
start
for
home
with
it
as
it
was
he
drove
off
and
miss
dawes
knowing
from
lifelong
experience
that
front
doors
are
merely
for
show
passed
around
the
main
body
of
the
house
and
rapped
on
the
door
in
the
ell
the
rap
was
not
answered
though
she
could
hear
some
one
moving
about
within
and
a
shrill
voice
singing
the
sweet
by
and
so
she
rapped
again
and
again
but
still
no
one
came
to
the
door
at
last
she
ventured
to
open
it
a
thin
woman
with
her
head
tied
up
in
a
colored
cotton
handkerchief
was
in
the
room
vigorously
wielding
a
broom
she
was
singing
in
a
high
cracked
voice
the
opening
of
the
door
let
in
a
gust
of
cold
wind
which
struck
the
singer
in
the
back
of
the
neck
and
caused
her
to
turn
around
hastily
hey
she
exclaimed
land
sakes
you
scare
a
body
to
death
shut
that
door
quick
i
ai
hankering
for
influenzy
who
are
you
what
do
you
want
why
did
you
knock
where
my
specs
she
took
a
pair
of
spectacles
from
the
mantel
shelf
rubbed
them
with
her
apron
and
set
them
on
the
bridge
of
her
thin
nose
then
she
inspected
the
schoolmistress
from
head
to
foot
i
beg
pardon
for
coming
in
shouted
phoebe
i
knocked
but
you
hear
you
are
beasley
are
you
i
do
want
none
replied
debby
with
emphasis
so
there
no
use
your
wastin
your
do
want
repeated
the
astonished
teacher
do
want
what
hey
i
say
i
do
want
do
want
what
whatever
is
you
peddlin
books
or
soap
or
tea
or
whatever
is
i
do
want
after
some
strenuous
minutes
the
visitor
managed
to
make
it
clear
to
beasley
mind
that
she
was
not
a
peddler
she
tried
to
add
a
word
of
further
explanation
but
it
was
effort
wasted
no
use
snapped
debby
i
ca
hear
you
you
speak
so
faint
wait
till
i
get
my
horn
it
in
the
settin
phoebe
wonder
as
to
what
the
horn
might
be
was
relieved
by
the
widow
appearance
a
moment
later
with
the
biggest
ear
trumpet
her
caller
had
ever
seen
there
now
she
said
adjusting
the
instrument
and
thrusting
the
end
under
the
teacher
nose
talk
into
that
if
you
a
peddler
what
be
you
sewin
machine
agent
phoebe
explained
that
she
had
come
some
distance
on
purpose
to
see
beasley
she
was
interested
in
the
thayers
who
used
to
live
in
orham
particularly
in
john
thayer
who
died
in
she
had
been
told
that
debby
formerly
lived
with
the
thayers
and
could
no
doubt
remember
a
great
deal
about
them
would
she
mind
answering
a
few
questions
and
so
on
beasley
her
hearing
now
within
degrees
of
the
normal
grew
interested
she
ushered
her
visitor
into
the
adjoining
room
and
proffered
her
a
chair
that
sitting
room
was
a
wonder
of
its
kind
even
to
the
teacher
accustomed
eyes
a
crayon
enlargement
of
the
late
beasley
hung
in
the
center
of
the
broadest
wall
space
and
was
not
the
ugliest
thing
in
the
apartment
having
said
this
further
description
is
unnecessary
particularly
to
those
who
remember
beasley
personal
appearance
what
you
so
interested
in
the
thayers
for
inquired
debby
one
of
the
heirs
be
you
they
did
leave
no
the
schoolmistress
was
not
an
heir
was
not
even
a
relative
of
the
family
but
she
was
was
interested
just
the
same
a
friend
of
hers
was
a
relative
and
what
is
your
friend
inquired
the
inquisitor
a
man
there
was
no
reason
why
miss
dawes
should
have
changed
color
but
according
to
debby
subsequent
testimony
she
did
she
blushed
so
the
widow
declares
no
she
protested
oh
no
it
a
she
a
child
that
all
a
little
girl
but
maybe
you
gettin
up
one
of
them
geographical
trees
suggested
beasley
i
seen
fust
settlers
down
in
the
trunk
and
children
and
grandchildren
spreadin
out
in
the
branches
is
that
it
here
was
an
avenue
of
escape
phoebe
stretched
the
truth
a
trifle
and
admitted
that
that
or
something
of
the
sort
was
what
she
was
engaged
in
the
explanation
seemed
to
be
satisfactory
debby
asked
her
visitor
name
and
misunderstanding
it
addressed
her
as
miss
dorcas
thereafter
then
she
proceeded
to
give
her
reminiscences
of
the
thayers
and
it
did
not
take
long
for
the
disappointed
teacher
to
discover
that
for
all
practical
purposes
these
reminiscences
were
valueless
beasley
remembered
many
things
but
nothing
at
all
concerning
john
thayer
life
in
the
west
nor
the
name
of
the
ship
he
sailed
in
nor
who
his
shipmates
were
he
never
wrote
home
but
once
or
twice
afore
he
died
she
said
and
when
he
did
emily
his
wife
never
told
me
what
was
in
his
letters
she
always
burnt
i
guess
i
used
to
hunt
around
for
when
she
was
out
but
she
burnt
to
spite
me
i
her
and
me
did
get
along
any
too
well
she
said
i
talked
too
much
to
other
folks
about
what
was
none
of
their
business
now
anybody
that
knows
me
knows
that
one
of
my
failin
i
told
her
so
says
i
and
so
on
for
ten
minutes
then
phoebe
ventured
to
repeat
the
words
out
west
and
her
companion
went
off
on
a
new
tack
she
had
just
been
west
herself
she
had
been
on
a
visit
to
her
husband
niece
who
lived
in
arizona
in
blazeton
arizona
it
the
nicest
town
ever
you
see
she
continued
and
the
smartest
most
place
talk
about
the
west
bein
oncivilized
my
land
you
ought
to
see
that
town
electric
lights
and
telephones
and
and
i
do
know
what
all
why
miss
miss
dorcas
marm
you
just
ought
to
see
the
photygraphs
i
got
that
was
took
out
there
my
niece
she
took
with
one
of
them
little
mites
of
cameras
you
would
believe
such
a
little
box
of
a
thing
could
take
such
photygraphs
i
goin
to

the
suffering

and
the

of
the
beasley

from
the
front

rear
and
both
sides
with
each
specimen
debby
delivered
a
descriptive
lecture
you
see
that
house
she
asked
well
much
of
a
one
to
look
at
but
it
got
the
most
interestin
story
tagged
on
to
it
i
made
eva
that
my
niece
take
a
picture
of
it
just
on
that
account
the
woman
that
lives
there
had
the
hardest
time
her
fust
name
desire
and
that
kind
of
made
me
take
an
interest
in
her
right
off
i
had
an
aunt
desire
once
and
it
a
name
you
do
hear
very
often
afterwards
i
got
to
know
her
real
well
she
was
a
widder
woman
like
me
only
she
did
have
as
much
sense
as
i
got
and
went
and
married
a
second
time
was
in
she
done
it
this
man
higgins
he
went
to
work
for
her
on
her
place
and
pretty
soon
he
married
her
they
lived
together
principally
on
her
fust
husband
insurance
money
i
until
a
year
or
so
ago
then
the
insurance
money
give
out
and
higgins
he
says
woman
he
says
i
never
let
a
husband
of
mine
call
me
woman
but
desire
did
seem
to
mind
woman
he
says
goin
over
to
phoenix
that
another
city
in
arizona
look
for
a
job
and
he
went
and
she
ai
heard
hide
i
mean
seen
hide
nor
heard
hair
what
does
ail
me
she
ai
seen
nor
heard
of
him
since
and
she
advertised
in
the
weekly
paper
and
i
do
know
what
all
she
thinks
he
was
murdered
you
know
that
what
makes
it
so
sort
of
creepy
and
interestin
everybody
was
awful
kind
to
her
and
we
got
to
be
real
good
friends
why
i
this
was
but
the
beginning
it
was
evident
that
beasley
had
thoroughly
enjoyed
herself
in
blazeton
and
that
the
sorrows
of
the
bereaved
desire
higgins
had
been
one
of
the
principal
sources
of
that
enjoyment
the
schoolmistress
endeavored
to
turn
the
subject
but
it
was
useless
i
fetched
home
a
whole
pile
of
them
newspapers
continued
debby
they
was
awful
interestin
full
of
pictures
of
blazeton
and
leadin
folks
and
all
and
in
some
of
the
back
numbers
was
the
advertisement
about
higgins
i
do
wish
i
could
show
to
you
but
i
lent
to
atwood
up
to
the
center
if
such
a
ways
go
and
fetch
atwood
been
awful
nice
to
me
she
took
care
of
my
trunks
and
things
when
i
went
west
yes
and
afore
that
when
i
went
to
bayport
to
keep
house
for
that
whittaker
i
told
you
about
that
but
i
will
by
and
by
them
trunks
had
lots
of
things
in
that
i
did
want
to
lose
nor
have
anybody
see
my
diaries
i
kept
a
diary
since
and
diaries
interrupted
phoebe
grasping
at
straws
did
you
keep
a
diary
while
you
were
at
the
thayers
yes
now
why
did
i
think
of
that
afore
likely
there
be
somethin
in
that
to
help
you
with
that
geographical
tree
i
used
to
put
down
everything
that
happened
and
where
you
goin
miss
dawes
had
risen
and
was
peering
out
of
the
window
i
was
looking
to
see
if
my
driver
was
anywhere
about
she
replied
i
thought
perhaps
he
would
drive
over
to
atwood
and
get
the
diary
for
you
but
i
do
see
just
then
from
around
the
corner
of
the
house
peeped
an
agitated
face
an
agitated
forefinger
beckoned
debby
stepped
to
the
window
beside
her
visitor
and
the
face
and
finger
went
out
of
sight
as
if
pulled
by
a
string
miss
phoebe
smiled
i
think
i
go
out
and
look
for
him
she
said
he
must
be
near
here
i
be
right
back
without
stopping
to
put
on
her
jacket
she
hurried
through
the
dining
room
out
of
the
door
and
around
the
corner
there
she
found
bangs
in
a
highly
nervous
state
why
did
you
tell
me
was
debby
beasley
you
was
comin
to
see
he
demanded
if
you
mentioned
that
deef
image
name
you
never
got
me
to
drive
you
i
tell
you
that
yes
answered
the
teacher
sweetly
i
imagined
that
that
why
i
did
tell
you
bangs
now
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favor
will
you
drive
over

center
and

package

and
i
shall
be
ready
to
start
for
drive
drive
nothin
the
blacksmith
out
and
wo
be
back
for
another
hour
his
boy
there
but
he
a
big
enough
lunkhead
to
try
bailin
out
a
dory
with
a
fork
and
that
buggy
axle
is
bent
so
simply
got
to
be
fixed
i
no
more
go
home
to
ketury
with
that
buggy
as
than
i
oh
my
land
of
love
the
ejaculation
was
almost
a
groan
there
at
the
corner
ear
trumpet
adjusted
and
spectacles
glistening
stood
debby
beasley
bailey
appeared
to
wilt
under
her
gaze
as
if
the
spectacles
were
twin
suns
miss
dawes
looked
as
if
she
very
much
wanted
to
laugh
the
widow
stared
in
silence
how
how
d
do
beasley
faltered
bangs
not
forgetting
to
raise
his
voice
i
hope
you
lookin
as
well
as
you
feel
i
mean
i
hope
you
beasley
nodded
decisively
yes
she
answered
i
pretty
thank
you
what
was
the
matter
bangs
why
did
you
come
in
do
you
usually
make
your
calls
round
the
corner
the
gentleman
addressed
seemed
unable
to
reply
the
schoolmistress
came
to
the
rescue
you
must
blame
bangs
beasley
she
explained
he
was
responsible
for
what
happened
at
captain
whittaker
he
is
the
gentleman
who
drove
me
over
here
i
was
going
to
send
him
to
atwood
for
the
who
said
i
was
blamin
him
queried
the
widow
if
was
that
little
tidditt
thing
i
might
feel
different
but
considerin
that
i
got
this
horn
from
bangs
i
willin
to
let
bygones
be
past
it
helps
my
hearin
a
lot
them
was
good
while
they
lasted
but
they
got
out
of
kilter
quick
sha
bother
bangs
if
he
can
square
his
own
conscience
i
bailey
conscience
was
not
troubling
him
greatly
and
he
seemed
relieved
phoebe
told
of
the
damaged
buggy
humph
grunted
the
widow
the
horse
did
get
bent
too
did
he
bangs
indignantly
declared
that
the
horse
was
all
right
um
hum
well
then
i
guess
i
can
supply
a
carriage
my
fust
cousin
ezra
that
died
used
to
be
doctor
here
and
he
give
me
his
sulky

he

a
new

harness
him
in
i
be

the

gasped
the
teacher
you

besides
i
always

you

set
in
the
settin
room
till
we
get
back
take
us
long
do
say
another
word
chapter
xvi
a
remarkable
drive
and
what
followed
the
number
of
reasons
given
by
bangs
one
after
the
other
to
prove
that
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
him
to
be
charioteer
was
a
credit
to
the
resources
of
his
invention
the
blacksmith
might
be
back
any
minute
it
was
dinner
time
and
he
was
hungry
henry
the
horse
was
tired
it
was
a
nice
day
for
riding
and
he
would
come
over
some
other
time
and
take
the
widow
out
he
but
debby
had
a
conclusive
answer
for
each
protest
you
said
yourself
the
blacksmith
would
be
back
for
an
hour
she
observed
and
you
can
leave
word
with
the
boy
what
he
to
do
when
he
does
come
as
for
dinner
i
be
real
glad
to
give
you
and
miss
dorcas
a
snack
soon
we
get
back
i
do
mind
if
it
ai
a
pleasant
day
a
little
fresh
air
do
me
good
i
been
shut
up
here
ever
since
i
got
back
from
out
west
now
hurry
right
along
and
fetch
your
horse
i
unlock
the
but
beasley
put
in
the
schoolmistress
why
could
you
give
us
a
note
to
atwood
and
let
us
stop
for
the
diary
on
our
way
home
i
could
return
it
to
you
by
mail
or
you
might
get
it
yourself
some
other
day
and
mail
it
to
no
no
never
put
off
till
what
you
can
do
my
husband
was
a
great
hand
to
put
off
and
put
off
for
the
last
eight
years
of
his
life
i
was
at
him
to
buy
a
new
suit
of
clothes
the
one
he
had
was
blue
to
start
with
but
it
faded
to
a
brown
and
toward
the
last
of
it
i
declare
if
it
did
commence
to
turn
green
nothin
i
could
say
would
make
him
heave
it
away
even
then
seemed
to
think
more
of
it
than
ever
said
he
wanted
to
hang
to
it
a
spell
and
see
what
turn
next
but
he
died
and
was
laid
out
in
that
same
suit
and
i
was
so
mortified
at
the
funeral
i
could
think
of
nothin
else
no
i
go
after
them
papers
and
the
diary
while
they
fresh
in
my
mind
and
besides
do
you
i
let
sarah
ann
atwood
rummage
through
my
trunks
i
guess
not
phoebe
began
to
be
sorry
she
had
thought
of
sending
for
the
diary
particularly
as
the
chance
of
its
containing
valuable
information
was
so
remote
beasley
went
into
the
house
to
dress
for
the
ride
the
schoolmistress
went
with
her
as
far
as
the
sitting
room
the
perturbed
bailey
stalked
off
muttering
to
the
blacksmith
in
a
little
while
he
returned
leading
henry
by
the
bridle
debby
adorned
with
the
beflowered
bonnet
she
had
worn
when
she
arrived
at
the
cy
whittaker
place
and
with
a
black
cloth
cape
over
her
lean
shoulders
was
waiting
for
him
by
the
open
door
of
the
barn
the
cape
had
a
fur
collar
cat
fur
so
bangs
said
afterwards
in
describing
it
pull
the
sulky
right
out
commanded
the
widow
bailey
stared
into
the
black
interior
of
the
barn
which
is
it
he
shouted
beasley
pointed
with
her
ear
trumpet
why
that
one
there
of
course
a
truck
cart
you
expect
me
to
ride
in
that
would
you
bangs
entered
the
barn
seized
the
vehicle
indicated
by
the
shafts
and
drew
it
out
into
the
yard
he
inspected
it
deliberately
and
then
sat
weakly
down
on
the
chopping
block
near
by
apparently
he
was
overcome
by
emotion
the
sulky
bequeathed
by
the
late
doctor
had
been
built
to
order
for
its
former
owner
it
was
of
the
carryall
variety
except
that
it
had
but
a
single
narrow
seat
its
top
was
square
and
was
curtained
the
curtains
being
tightly
buttoned
down
altogether
it
was
something
of
a
curiosity
miss
dawes
who
had
come
out
to
see
the
start
looked
at
the
sulky
then
at
bangs
face
and
turned
her
back
her
shoulders
shook
it
used
to
be
a
real
nice
carriage
when
ezra
had
it
commented
the
widow
admiringly
it
needs
ilin
and
sprucin
up
now
but
i
guess
do
come
to
bailey
who
had
not
risen
from
the
chopping
block
hurry
up
and
harness
or
we
never
get
started
thought
you
wanted
to
get
back
for
dinner
bangs
stood
up
and
heaved
a
sigh
i
did
he
answered
slowly
but
with
a
glance
at
the
sulky
somethin
seems
to
have
took
away
my
appetite
teacher
do
you
mean
to
but
miss
dawes
had
withdrawn
to
the
corner
of
the
house
from
which
viewpoint
she
seemed
to
be
inspecting
the
surrounding
landscape
bailey
seized
henry
by
the
bridle
and
backed
him
into
the
shafts
back
up
he
roared
back
up
i
tell
you
you
need
look
at
me
that
way
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
ca
help
it
you
ai
any
worse
ashamed
than
i
am
there
the
ark
off
the
ways
all
aboard
turning
to
the
expectant
widow
he
boosted
her
not
too
tenderly
up
to
the
narrow
seat
then
he
climbed
in
himself
two
on
that
seat
made
a
tight
fit
bailey
took
up
the
reins
debby
leaned
forward
and
peered
around
the
edge
of
the
curtains
you
she
shouted
you
miss
dorcas
come
here
a
minute
i
want
to
tell
you
the
schoolmistress
her
face
red
and
her
eyes
moist
approached
i
just
wanted
to
say
explained
debby
that
i
ai
real
sure
as
that
diary
there
i
burnt
up
a
lot
of
my
old
letters
and
things
a
spell
ago
and
seems
to
me
i
burnt
some
old
diaries
too
but
maybe
that
one
of
anyhow
i
can
get
them
arizona
papers
and
i
do
want
you
to
see
they
the
most
interestin
things
now
she
added
turning
to
her
companion
on
the
seat
you
can
git
dap
just
as
soon
as
you
want
whether
or
not
bangs
wanted
to
git
dap
is
a
doubtful
question
but
at
all
events
he
did
before
the
astonished
miss
dawes
could
think
of
an
answer
to
the
observation
concerning
the
diary
the
carriage
its
long
unused
axles
shrieking
protests
moved
out
of
the
yard
the
schoolmistress
watched
it
go
then
she
returned
to
the
sitting
room
and
collapsed
in
a
rocking
chair
once
out
from
the
shelter
of
the
house
and
on
the
open
road
the
sulky
received
the
full
force
of
the
wind
the
first
gust
that
howled
in
from
the
bay
struck
its
curtained
side
with
a
sudden
burst
of
power
that
caused
beasley
to
clutch
her
driver
arm
good
land
of
mercy
she
screamed
it
blows
real
hard
do
it
bangs
answer
was
in
the
form
of
delicate
sarcasm
bellowed
into
the
ear
trumpet
sho
he
exclaimed
i
want
to
know
you
do
say
now
you
mention
it
seems
as
if
i
had
noticed
a
little
air
another
gust
tilted
the
carriage
top
debby
clutched
the
arm
still
tighter
why
it
blows
awful
hard
she
cried
i
no
idee
it
blew
like
want
to
ship
and
go
home
again
whooped
bailey
hopefully
but
the
widow
did
intend
to
give
up
the
rare
luxury
of
a
ride
which
a
kind
providence
had
cast
in
her
way
no
no
she
answered
i
guess
if
you
folks
come
all
the
way
from
bayport
i
can
stand
it
as
fur
the
center
but
hurry
all
you
can
you
i
kind
of
of
the
springs
what
springs
let
go
my
arm
will
you
it
goin
to
beasley
let
go
of
the
arm
momentarily
i
mean
the
springs
on
this
carriage
she
explained
last
time
i
lent
it
to
anybody
solon
davis
was
he
said
the
bolts
underneath
was
pretty
nigh
rusted
out
and
about
all
that
held
the
wagon
part
on
was
its
own
weight
so
we
have
to
be
kind
of
well
i
swan
to
man
was
bangs
sole
comment
on
the
amazing
disclosure
however
as
an
expression
of
concentrated
and
profound
disgust
it
was
quite
sufficient
he
spoke
but
once
during
the
remainder
of
the
trip
to
the
then
when
his
passenger
begged
to
know
if
that
whittaker
man
had
been
well
since
she
left
he
shouted
yes
ever
since
and
relapsed
into
his
former
gloomy
silence
the
widow
stop
at
the
atwood
house
which
was
in
the
immediate
rear
of
the
atwood
store
was
of
a
half
hour
duration
bailey
refused
to
leave
the
seat
of
the
sulky
and
sat
there
speaking
to
no
one
not
even
replying
to
the
questions
of
a
group
of
loungers
who
gathered
to
inspect
the
ancient
vehicle
and
professed
to
be
in
doubt
as
to
whether
it
had
been
washed
in
with
the
tide
or
been
left
to
him
in
a
will
at
last
debby
made
her
appearance
her
arms
filled
with
newspapers
the
latter
she
piled
under
the
carriage
seat
and
then
climbed
to
her
former
place
beside
the
driver
henry
in
response
to
a
slap
from
the
reins
got
under
way
once
more
the
axles
squeaked
and
screamed
gee
cried
one
youngster
from
the
steps
of
the
store
it
the
steam
calliope
when
the
rest
of
the
show
comin
hi
yelled
another
see
how
close
they
hugged
up
together

lovin
it
a
weddin
shut
up
roared
the
tortured
bailey
whose
hat
had
blown
back
into
the
body
of
the
sulky
leaving
his
bald
head
exposed
to
the
cutting
wind
the
audience
begged
him
to
give
them
a
lock
of
his
hair
and
added
other
remarks
of
a
personal
nature
concerning
the
youth
and
beauty
of
the
bridal
couple
and
their
chariot
bangs
was
in
a
state
of
dumb
frenzy
debby
who
without
her
trumpet
had
heard
nothing
of
all
this
was
smiling
and
garrulous
i
found
all
the
papers

said

right
under
the
seat
goin
to

to
have
the
interestin
parts
all

miss
dorcas
when
we
get
home
ai
it
nice
i
found
in
spite
of
her
driver
remonstrances
unheard
because
of
the
nonadjustment
of
the
trumpet
she
reached
under
the
seat
and
brought
out
the
pile
of
blazeton
weeklies
with
her
feet
upon
the
pile
to
keep
it
from
blowing
away
she
proceeded
to
unfold
one
of
the
papers
it
crackled
and
snapped
in
the
wind
like
a
loose
mainsail
keep
that
dratted
thing

of
my
face

he

bailey
comments
on
the
prominent
business
man
appearance
were
anything
but
flattering
debby
continued
to
reach
for
more
papers
carefully
replacing
those
she
had
inspected
in
the
pile
beneath
her
feet
the
wind
blew
as
hard
as
ever
even
harder
for
it
was
now
almost
dead
ahead
henry
plodded
along
they
were
in
the
hollow
at
the
foot
of
the
last
long
hill
that
from
which
the
blacksmith
shop
had
first
been
sighted

the
passenger
i

advertisement
of
desire
higgins
let
see
now
be
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
pile
the
paper
it
in
is
a
last
year
she
bobbed
down
behind
the
high
dashboard
bangs
stood
up
in
order
that
her
gymnastics
might
interfere
to
a
lesser
degree
with
his
driving
the
equipage
began
to
move
up
the
slope
of
the
hill
bouncing
and
twisting
in
the
frozen
ruts
here
is
exclaimed
debby
i
remember

in
this
number

picture

front
page

i
like
nothin
better
than
to
live
out
there
wanted
of
my
husband
here
is
um
hum
she
straightened
up
and
eagerly
began
reading
the
advertisement
the
hill
was
very
steep
just
at
its
top
and
the
sulky
slanted
backward
at
a
sharp
angle
a
terrific
burst
of
wind
tore
around
the
corner
of
the
bluff
it
eddied
through
the
sulky
between
the
dashboard
and
the
curtained
sides
the
widow
in
her
excitement
at
finding
the
advertisement
had
inadvertently
removed
her
feet
from
the
pile
of
papers
in
an
instant
the
air
was
filled
with
whirling
copies
of
the
blazeton
weekly
courier
henry
the
horse
was
a
sober
animal
who
had
long
ago
reached
the
age
of
discretion
but
to
have
his
old
ears
and
eyes
suddenly
blanketed
with
a
flapping
white
thing
swooping
apparently
from
nowhere
was
too
much
even
for
his
sedate
nerves
he
jumped
sidewise
the
reins
were
jerked
from
the
driver
hands
and
fell
in
the
road
mercy
on
us
shrieked
debby
clutching
her
companion
about
the
waist
what
let
go
of
me
howled
bailey
pushing
her
violently
aside
whoa
stand
still
but
henry
refused
to
stand
still
the
flapping
paper
still
clung
to
his
agitated
head
he
reared
and
pranced
jerking
the
sulky
back
and
forth
its
wheels
still
wedged
in
the
ruts
bailey
sprang
to
the
ground
to
pick
up
the
reins
he
seized
them
but
fell
as
he
did
so
the
tug
at
his
bits
turned
henry
head
literally
and
figuratively
he
reared
and
whirled
about
the
sulky
rose
on
two
wheels
the
screaming
beasley
collapsed
against
its
downward
side
another
moment
and
the
whole
upper
half
of
the
sulky
body
seat
curtains
and
debby
tilted
over
the
lower
wheels
and
the
rusted
bolts
failing
to
hold
slid
with
a
thump
to
the
frozen
road
the
wind
catching
it
underneath
as
it
slid
tipped
it
backward
then
henry
ran
away
miss
dawes
left
alone
in
the
house
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
had
amused
herself
for
a
time
with
the
beasley
library
which
partially
filled
a
shelf
in
the
sitting
room
but
the
book
of
martyrs
and
a
thoughts
on
death
were
not
cheering
literature
particularly
as
the
author
of
the
latter
volume
thought
so
dismally
concerning
the
future
of
all
who
did
not
believe
precisely
as
he
did
so
the
teacher
laid
down
the
book
with
a
shudder
and
wandered
about
the
room
inspecting
the
late
beasley
portrait
the
photographs
in
splintwork
frames
the
alum
basket
on
the
mantel
the
blue
castles
blue
trees
and
blue
people
pictured
on
the
window
shades
and
other
works
of
art
in
the
apartment
she
even
peeped
into
the
parlor
but
the
musty
smell
of
that
dusky
tomb
was
too
much
for
her
and
she
sat
down
by
the
window
under
the
empty
bird
cage
to
look
up
the
road
and
watch
for
the
return
of
the
sulky
and
its
occupants
sitting
there
she
was
a
witness
of
the
alarming
catastrophe
on
the
hilltop
and
reached
the
front
gate
just
in
time
to
see
henry
go
galloping
by
dragging
the
four
wheels
and
springs
of
the
sulky
while
sprawled
across
the
rear
axle
and
still
clinging
to
the
reins
hung
a
familiar
howling
and
most
wickedly
profane
individual
by
the
name
of
bangs
the
runaway
dashed
on
toward
the
blacksmith
shop
phoebe
bareheaded
and
coatless
ran
up
the
hill
before
she
reached
the
crest
she
was
aware
of
muffled
screams
which
sounded
as
if
the
screamer
was
shut
up
in
a
trunk
screamed
beasley
ow
let
me
out
help
stuck
my
back
broke
the
upper
part
of
the
sulky
with
its
boxlike
curtained
top
lay
on
its
side
in
the
road
from
somewhere
within
the
box
came
the
groans
and
screams
the
gale
swept
the
hilltop
and
for
a
quarter
mile
to
leeward
the
scenery
was
animated
by
soaring
fluttering
copies
of
the
blazeton
courier
that
swooped
and
ducked
like
mammoth
white
butterflies
the
panting
and
alarmed
teacher
stooped
and
peered
into
the
dark
shadow
between
the
dashboard
and
the
back
curtain
all
she
could
make
out
at
first
were
a
pair
of
thin
ankles
and
congress
shoes
in
agitated
motion
these
bobbed
up
and
down
behind
the
overturned
seat
and
its
displaced
cushion
o
beasley
screamed
phoebe
are
you
hurt
debby
of
course
did
not
hear
the
question
she
continued
to
groan
and
scream
for
help
her
lungs
were
not
injured
at
all
events
the
schoolmistress
dropping
on
her
knees
reached
into
the
sulky
top
and
tugged
at
the
seat
it
was
rather
tightly
wedged
but
she
managed
to
loosen
it
and
pull
it
toward
her
the
widow
raised
herself
on
an
elbow
and
looked
out
between
the
flowers
of
her
smashed
bonnet
who
is
it
she
demanded
oh
is

miss
dorcas

her
rescuer
pulled
the
seat
forward
and
with
an
effort
tumbled
it
clear
of
the
curtains
debby
raised
herself
still
higher
oh

groaned

she
scrambled
out
of
her
prison
on
hands
and
knees
and
jumped
to
her
feet
with
reassuring
alacrity
her
cape
was
draped
in
a
roll
about
her
neck
and
her
bonnet
hung
jauntily
over
her
left
eye
i

relieved

serious
consequences
and
trying
her
hardest
not
to
laugh
assisted
the
widow
to
rearrange
her
wearing
apparel
the
blacksmith
and
his
helper
came
running
up
the
hill
hello

bangs

to
with
the
rest
of
my
carriage
the
blacksmith
pointed
to
his
shop
in
the
hollow
before
it
stood
bangs
holding
henry
by
the
bridle
and
staring
in
their
direction
he
all
right
volunteered
the
the
horse
stopped
soon
he
got
to
the
foot
of
the
next
beasley

arizona
papers
and
took
the
trouble
to
tote
all
the
way
here
so
you
could
look
at
and
now
she
shook
with
indignation
and
waved
her
hand
toward
a
section
of
horizon
where
little
white
dots
indicated
the
whereabouts
of
the
couriers

blowed
from

the
blacksmith

to
that
carriage
will
you
she
stalked
off
down
the
hill
the
schoolmistress
turning
to
follow
her
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
helper
doubled
up
with
silent
laughter
and
the
blacksmith
grinning
broadly
as
he
stooped
toward
the
capsized
sulky
phoebe
was
downcast
and
disappointed
she
was
convinced
in
her
own
mind
that
the
honorable
atkins
had
some
hidden
motive
for
his
espousal
of
the
thomas
cause
asaph
fruitless
quest
in
orham
had
not
shaken
her
faith
captain
cy
had
refused
to
seek
debby
beasley
for
information
concerning
the
thayers
and
so
she
on
her
own
responsibility
had
done
so
and
this
was
the
ridiculous
ending
of
her
journey
the
diary
had
been
a
forlorn
hope
now
that
was
burned
poor
and
poor
some
one
else
debby
marching
down
the
hill
continued
to
sputter
about
the
lost
weeklies
it
an
everlastin
shame
she
declared
i
just
found
the
one
with
that
advertisement
in
it
and
was
readin
it
i
remember
the
part
i
read
plain
as
could
be
while
we
eatin
dinner
i
tell
you
about
but
miss
dawes
did
not
care
for
dinner
like
tidditt
and
the
captain
she
had
had
about
all
the
debby
beasley
she
wanted
yes

will
stop
too
affirmed
the
widow
i
want
to
tell
you
more
about
blazeton
i
can
see
that
advertisement
this
minute
right
afore
my
eyes

of
my
husband
edward
higgins
five
foot
eight
inches
tall
sandy
complected
brown
hair
and
yellowish
mustache
not
lame
but
has
a
peculiar
slight
limp
with
his
left
foot
what
asked
the
schoolmistress
stopping
short
hey
a
peculiar
limp
with
his
left
foot
i
remember
how
desire
used
to
talk
about
that
limp
she
said
was
almost
as
if
he
stuttered
with
his
leg
he
hurt
it
when
he
was
up
in
montana
and
oh
cried
miss
dawes
the
color
had
left
her
face
yes
you
see
he
used
to
be
a
miner
or
somethin
up
there
he
never
say
much
about
his
younger
days
but
one
time
he
did
tell
that
just
got
as
far
as
that
limp
when
the
sulky
upset
talk
about
surprised
i
never
was
so
surprised
in
my
life
as
when
that
horse
critter
rared
up
and
phoebe
interrupted
her
color
had
come
back
and
her
eyes
were
shining
mrs
beasley
she
cried
i
think
i
shall
change
my
mind
i
believe
i
will
stay
to
dinner
after
all
i
ever
so
much
interested
in
bailey
and
the
teacher
began
their
long
drive
home
about
four
the
buggy
axle
had
been
fixed
and
the
wind
was
less
violent
bangs
was
glum
and
moody
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
say
teacher
he
said
at
length
i
like
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
if
it
ai
necessary
i
wish
you
would
say
nothin
about
that
business
to
the
folks
to
home
it
does
sound
so
dum
foolish
i
never
hear
the
last
of
miss
dawes
who
had
been
in
high
spirits
now
took
a
moment
for
reflection
all
right
she
said
nodding
vigorously
we
wo
mention
it
then
we
wo
tell
a
soul
you
can
say
that
i
called
at
the
atwoods
if
you
want
to
that
will
be
true
because
i
did
and
we
have
beasley
for
our
secret
yours
and
mine
until
we
decide
to
tell
it
a
bargain
bangs
we
must
shake
hands
on
they
shook
hands
and
bailey
looking
in
her
face
thought
he
never
saw
her
look
so
well
or
as
young
she
was
pretty
he
decided
then
he
thought
of
his
own
choice
of
a
wife
and
well
if
he
had
any
regrets
he
has
mentioned
them
not
even
to
his
of
the
board
of
strategy
chapter
xvii

captain
remembers
his
age

hung
up
her
stocking
by
the
stove
and
found
it
warty
and
dropsical

next
morning

a
generous
overflow
of
gifts
piled
on
the
floor
beneath

over
catalogues
of
toys
and
books
and
the
orders
he
sent
to
the
big
shops
in
boston
were
lengthy
and
costly
the
little
girl
eyes
opened
wide
when
she
saw
the
stocking
and
the
treasures
heaped
on
the
floor
she
sat
in
her
nighty
amidst
the
wonders
books
and
playthings
in
a
circle
about
her
and
the
biggest
doll
of
all
hugged
close
in
her
arms
captain
cy
who
had
arisen
at
half
past
five
in
order
to
be
with
her
on
the
great
occasion
was
at
least
as
happy
as
she
like
do
you
he
asked
smiling
like
o
uncle
cy
what
makes
everybody
so
good
to
me
i
do
know
strange
thing
ai
it
considerin
what
a
hard
little
ticket
you
laughed
she
understood
her
uncle
cy
and
did
mind
being
called
a
hard
ticket
by
him
i
i
did
believe
anybody
could
have
such
a
nice
christmas
i
never
saw
so
many
nice
humph
what
do
you
like
best
the
answer
was
a
question
and
was
characteristic
which
did
you
give
me
asked
the
captain
would
have
dodged
but
she
would
let
him
so
one
by
one
the
presents
he
had
given
were
indicated
and
put
by
themselves
the
remainder
were
but
few
but
she
insisted
that
the
givers
of
these
should
be
named
when
the
sorting
was
over
she
sat
silently
hugging
her
doll
and
apparently
thinking
well
inquired
the
amused
captain
made
up
your
mind
yet
which
do
you
like
best
the
child
nodded
why
these
of
course
she
declared
with
emphasis
pointing
with
her
dollie
slippered
foot
at
captain
cy
pile
so
do
hey
did
know
i
could
pick
so
well
all
right
the
first
prize
is
mine
who
takes
the
second
this
time
deliberated
before
answering
at
last
however
she
bent
forward
and
touched
the
teacher
gifts
these
she
said
i
like
these
next
captain
cy
was
surprised
sho
he
exclaimed
you
do
say
yes
i
think
i
like
teacher
next
to
you
i
like
georgianna
and
tidditt
and
bangs
of
course
but
i
like
her
a
little
better
you
uncle
cyrus
the
captain
changed
the
subject
he
asked
her
what
she
should
name
her
doll
the
board
of
strategy
came
in
during
the
forenoon
and
the
presents
had
to
be
shown
to
them
while
the
exhibition
was
in
progress
miss
dawes
called
and
before
she
left
gabe
lumley
drove
up
in
the
depot
wagon
bearing
a
big
express
package
addressed
to
miss
emily
thomas
humph
exclaimed
captain
cy
somethin
more
for
hey
who
in
the
world
sent
it
do
you
asaph
and
bailey
made
various
inane
suggestions
as
to
the
sender
phoebe
said
nothing
there
was
a
frown
on
her
face
as
she
watched
the
captain
get
to
work
on
the
box
with
chisel
and
hammer
it
contained
a
beautiful
doll
fully
and
expensively
dressed
and
pinned
to
the
dress
was
a
card
to
dear
little
emmie
from
her
lonesome
the
board
of
strategy
looked
at
the
doll
in
wonder
and
astonishment
captain
cy
strode
away
to
the
window
well
exclaimed
bangs
i
did
believe
he
had
that
much
heart
inside
of
him
i
bet
you
that
cost
four
or
five
dollars
ai
that
so
cy
the
captain
did
not
answer
do
you
think
so
teacher
repeated
bailey
turning
to
phoebe
what
ails
you
you
do
seem
i
not
replied
the
lady
i
expected
something
of
that
captain
cy
wheeled
from
the
window
you
did
he
asked
yes
miss
phinney
said
the
other
day
she
had
heard
that
that
man
was
going
to
give
his
daughter
a
beautiful
present
she
was
very
enthusiastic
about
his
generosity
and
i
asked
who
told
her
and
she
said
oh
tad
is
that
so
the
captain
looked
at
her
yes
and
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
simpson
had
orders
to
make
the
known
to
as
many
townspeople
as
hum
i
see
you
figure
that
thomas
help
his
popularity
and
make
his
case
stronger
is
that
it
not
exactly
i
doubt
if
he
ever
thought
of
such
a
thing
himself
but
some
one
thought
for
him
and
some
one
must
have
supplied
the
well
they
say
he
to
work
up
in
i
know
but
no
one
can
tell
where
he
works
captain
whittaker
this
is
atkins
doing
you
know
it
now
why
does
he
a
busy
man
take
such
an
interest
in
getting
this
child
away
from
you
captain
cy
shook
his
head
and
smiled
teacher
he
said
you
dead
set
on
taggin
heman
with
a
mystery
ai
you
miss
dawes
asked
the
forgetful
bailey
when
you
and
me
went
day
did
you
find
out
anything
from
phoebe
interrupted
quickly
mr
bangs
she
said
at
what
time
do
we
distribute
christmas
presents
at
your
boarding
house
i
suppose
you
must
have
many
christmas
secrets
to
keep
you
keep
a
secret
so
bangs
turned
red
the
hint
concerning
secret
keeping
was
not
wasted
he
did
not
mention
the
drive
again
a
little
later
captain
cy
found
busily
playing
with
the
doll
he
had
given
her
the
other
her
father
gift
was
nowhere
in
sight
i
put
her
back
in
the
box
said
the
child
in
reply
to
his
question
she
was
awful
pretty
but
i
think
i
goin
to
love
this
one
the
remark
seems
a
foolish
thing
to
give
comfort
to
a
grown
man
but
captain
cy
found
comfort
in
it
and
comfort
was
what
he
needed
he
needed
it
more
as
time
went
on
in
january
the
court
gave
its
decision
the
captain
appointment
as
guardian
was
revoked
with
the
father
alive
and
professedly
anxious
to
provide
for
the
support
nothing
else
was
to
be
expected
so
peabody
said
the
latter
entered
an
appeal
which
would
delay
matters
for
a
time
two
or
three
months
perhaps
meanwhile
captain
cy
was
to
retain
custody
of
but
the
court
action
expected
though
it
was
made
the
captain
very
blue
and
downcast
he
could
see
no
hope
he
felt
certain
that
he
should
lose
the
little
girl
in
the
end
in
spite
of
the
long
succession
of
appeals
which
his
lawyer
contemplated
and
what
would
become
of
her
then
what
sort
of
training
would
she
be
likely
to
have
who
would
her
associates
be
under
the
authority
of
a
father
such
as
hers
and
what
would
he
do
alone
in
the
old
house
when
she
had
gone
for
good
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
it
and
yet
he
thought
of
little
else
the
evenings
after
had
gone
to
bed
were
the
worst
during
the
day
he
tried
his
best
to
be
busy
at
something
or
other
the
doll
house
was
finished
and
he
had
begun
to
fashion
a
ship
in
miniature
in
reality
emily
being
a
normal
little
girl
was
not
greatly
interested
in
ships
but
because
uncle
cy
was
making
it
she
pretended
to
be
vastly
concerned
about
this
one
on
saturdays
and
after
school
hours
she
sat
on
a
box
in
the
wood
shed
where
the
captain
had
put
up
a
small
stove
and
watched
him
work
the
taboo
which
so
many
of
our
righteous
and
townspeople
had
put
upon
the
whittaker
place
and
its
occupants
included
her
and
a
number
of
children
had
been
forbidden
to
play
with
her
this
however
did
not
prevent
their
tormenting
her
about
her
father
and
her
disreputable
guardian
but
the
captain
evenings
were
miserable
he
no
longer
went
to
simmons
he
did
care
for
the
crowd
there
and
knew
they
were
all
down
on
him
josiah
dimick
called
occasionally
and
the
board
of
strategy
often
but
their
conversation
was
rather
tiresome
there
were
times
when
captain
cy
hated
bayport
the
house
he
had
fixed
up
with
such
interest
and
pride
and
the
old
sitting
room
in
particular
the
mental
picture
of
comfort
and
contentment
which
had
been
his
dream
through
so
many
years
of
struggle
and
wandering
looked
farther
off
than
ever
sometimes
he
was
tempted
to
run
away
taking
with
him
but
the
captain
had
never
run
away
from
a
fight
yet
he
had
never
abandoned
a
ship
while
there
was
a
chance
of
keeping
her
afloat
and
besides
there
was
another
reason
phoebe
dawes
had
come
to
be
his
chief
reliance
he
saw
a
great
deal
of
her
often
when
she
walked
home
from
school
she
found
him
hanging
over
the
front
gate
and
they
talked
of
various
things
of
progress
with
her
studies
of
the
school
work
and
similar
topics
he
called
her
by
her
first
name
now
although
in
this
there
was
nothing
unusual
after
a
few
weeks
acquaintance
we
bayporters
almost
invariably
address
people
by
their
front
names
sometimes
she
came
to
the
house
with
emily
then
the
three
sat
by
the
stove
in
the
sitting
room
and
the
apartment
became
really
cheerful
in
the
captain
eyes
phoebe
was
in
good
spirits
she
was
as
hopeful
as
captain
cy
was
despondent
she
seemed
to
have
little
fear
of
the
outcome
of
the
legal
proceedings
the
appeals
and
the
rest
in
fact
she
now
appeared
desirous
of
evading
the
subject
and
there
was
about
her
an
air
of
suppressed
excitement
her
optimism
was
the
best
sort
of
bracer
for
the
captain
failing
courage
her
advice
was
always
good
and
a
talk
with
her
left
him
with
shoulders
squared
mentally
and
almost
happy
one
cold
rainy
afternoon
early
in
february
she
came
in
with
who
had
availed
herself
of
the
shelter
of
the
teacher
umbrella
georgianna
was
in
the
kitchen
baking
and
emily
had
been
promised
a
saucer
pie
so
the
child
went
out
to
superintend
the
construction
of
that
treat
set
down
teacher
said
captain
cy
pushing
forward
a
rocker
my
but
i
glad
to
see
you
was
a
whetstone
here
what
the
news
anything
why
no
replied
phoebe
accepting
the
rocker
and
throwing
open
her
wet
jacket
there
no
news
in
particular
but
i
wanted
to
ask
if
you
had
seen
the
breeze
um
hum
was
the
listless
answer
i
presume
likely
you
mean
the
news
about
the
appropriation
and
the
editorial
dig
at
yours
truly
yes
seen
it
they
do
bother
me
much
i
got
more
important
things
on
my
mind
just
congressman
atkins
pledge
in
his
farewell
speech
concerning
the
mighty
effort
he
was
to
make
toward
securing
the
appropriation
for
bayport
harbor
was
in
process
of
fulfillment
so
he
had
written
to
the
local
paper
but
alas
the
mighty
effort
was
likely
to
prove
unavailing
in
spite
of
the
honorable
heman
battle
for
his
constituents
rights
it
seemed
certain
that
the
bill
would
not
provide
the
thirty
thousand
dollars
for
bayport
at
least
not
this
year
bill
other
and
more
powerful
interests
would
win
out
and
instead
another
section
of
the
coast
be
improved
at
the
public
expense
the
congressman
was
deeply
sorry
almost
he
had
battled
hard
for
his
beloved
town
he
had
worked
night
and
day
but
to
be
perfectly
frank
there
was
little
or
no
hope
few
of
us
blamed
heman
atkins
the
majority
considered
his
letter
noble
and
so
but
some
one
must
be
blamed
for
a
community
disappointment
like
this
and
the
scapegoat
was
on
the
premises
how
about
that
committee
of
one
at
town
meeting
how
about
the
blatant
person
who
had
declared
he
could
have
gotten
the
appropriation
what
had
the
committee
done
nothing
nothing
at
all
he
had
not
even
written
to
the
capital
so
far
as
anyone
could
find
out
much
less
gone
there
so
at
simmons
and
the
sewing
circle
and
after
meeting
on
sunday
cy
whittaker
was
again
discussed
and
derided
and
this
week
breeze
out
that
morning
contained
a
sarcastic
editorial
which
mentioned
no
names
but
hinted
at
a
certain
now
notorious
person
who
had
boasted
loudly
but
who
had
again
been
weighed
in
the
balance
of
public
opinion
and
found
miss
dawes
did
not
seem
pleased
with
the
captain
nonchalant
attitude
toward
the
breeze
and
its
editorial
she
tapped
the
braided
mat
with
her
foot
captain
cyrus
she
said
if
you
intended
doing
nothing
toward
securing
that
appropriation
why
did
you
accept
the
responsibility
for
it
at
the
meeting
captain
cy
looked
up
her
tone
reminded
him
of
their
first
meeting
when
she
had
reproved
him
for
going
to
sleep
and
leaving
to
the
mercy
of
the
cahoon
cow
well
he
said
afore
this
thomas
business
happened
to
knock
all
my
plans
on
their
beam
ends
i
done
thinkin
about
that
appropriation
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
must
be
some
reason
for
heman
comin
about
so
sudden
he
was
sartin
sure
of
the
thirty
thousand
for
a
spell
then
all
to
once
he
begun
to
take
in
sail
and
go
on
tack
i
do
know
much
about
politics
but
i
know
he
knows
all
the
politics
there
is
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
a
live
man
one
with
eyes
in
his
head
went
to
washington
and
looked
around
he
might
find
the
reason
and
if
he
did
find
it
maybe
heman
could
be
coaxed
into
changin
his
mind
again
anyhow
i
was
willin
to
take
the
risk
of
tryin
and
besides
tad
and
abe
leonard
had
me
on
the
griddle
at
that
meetin
and
i
spoke
up
sharp
too
sharp
but
you
still
believe
that
you
might
help
if
you
went
to
washington
yes
i
guess
i
do
anyhow
i
ask
some
pretty
questions
you
see
i
ai
lived
here
in
bayport
all
my
life
and
i
do
swaller
all
the
bait
heman
heaves
then
why
do
you
go
hey
why
do
i
go
and
leave
and
emily
would
be
all
right
and
perfectly
safe
georgianna
thinks
the
world
of
her
and
captain
whittaker
i
do
like
to
hear
these
people
talk
of
you
as
they
do
i
do
like
to
read
such
things
in
the
paper
that
you
were
only
bragging
in
order
to
be
popular
and
meant
to
shirk
when
the
time
came
for
action
i
know
they
not
true
i
know
it
captain
cy
was
gratified
and
his
gratification
showed
in
his
voice
thank
you
phoebe
he
said
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
but
you
see
i
do
take
any
interest
in
such
things
any
more
when
i
realize
that
pretty
soon
i
got
to
give
up
that
little
girl
for
good
i
ca
bear
to
be
away
from
her
a
minute
hardly
i
do
like
to
leave
her
here
alone
with
georgianna
and
i
will
keep
an
eye
on
her
you
trust
me
do
you
trust
you
by
the
big
dipper
you
about
the
only
one
i
can
trust
these
days
i
do
know
how
i
have
pulled
through
this
if
you
helped
you
from
ase
and
bailey
and
their
kind
not
anything
against
them
either
but
you
and
and
and
do
you
know
if
i
had
a
woman
like
you
to
advise
me
all
these
years
and
keep
me
from
goin
off
the
course
i
might
have
been
somebody
by
i
think
you
somebody
as
it
do
talk
that
way
i
own
up
i
like
to
hear
you
but
i
it
ai
true
you
say
i
amount
to
somethin
well
what
i
come
back
home
here
with
some
money
in
my
pocket
thinkin
that
was
about
all
was
necessary
to
make
me
a
good
deal
of
a
feller
the
old
cy
whittaker
place
i
said
to
myself
was
goin
to
be
a
real
cy
whittaker
place
again
and
i
be
a
real
whittaker
a
man
who
should
stand
for
somethin
as
my
dad
and
granddad
did
afore
me
the
town
should
respect
me
and
i
do
things
to
help
it
along
and
what
it
all
come
to
why
every
young
one
on
the
street
is
told
to
be
good
for
fear
he
grow
up
like
me
ai
that
so
course
it
so
i
you
shall
not
speak
so
do
you
imagine
that
you
not
respected
by
everyone
whose
respect
counts
for
anything
yes
and
by
others
too
do
you
suppose
atkins
respects
you
down
in
his
heart
if
he
has
one
does
your
housekeeper
who
sees
you
every
day
respect
and
like
you
and
little
emily
does
she
love
you
more
than
she
does
all
the
rest
of
us
together
well
i
guess
does
care
for
the
old
man
some
that
a
fact
she
says
she
likes
you
next
best
though
did
you
know
that
but
miss
dawes
was
indignant
captain
whittaker
she
declared
one
would
think
you
were
a
hundred
years
old
to
hear
you
you
are
always
calling
yourself
an
old
man
does
atkins
call
himself
old
and
he
is
older
than
well
i
over
fifty
in
spite
of
the
habit
for
which
he
had
just
been
reproached
the
captain
found
this
a
difficult
statement
to
make
i
know
but
you
younger
than
most
of
us
at
you
see
confessing
too
she
added
with
a
laugh
and
a
little
blush
captain
cy
made
a
mental
calculation
twenty
years
he
said
musingly
twenty
years
is
a
long
time
no
old
and
worse
than
that
i
an
old
fool
i
guess
if
i
had
been
have
stayed
in
south
america
instead
of
comin
here
to
be
hooted
out
of
the
town
i
was
born
the
teacher
stamped
her
foot
oh
what
shall
i
do
with
you
she
exclaimed
it
is
wicked
for
you
to
say
such
things
do
you
suppose
that
atkins
would
find
it
necessary
to
work
as
he
is
doing
to
beat
a
fool
and
besides
you
not
complimentary
to
me
should
i
do
you
think
take
such
an
interest
in
one
who
was
an
imbecile
well
is
mighty
good
of
you
your
comin
here
so
to
help
fight
along
is
how
do
you
know
it
is
altogether
i
she
stopped
suddenly
and
the
color
rushed
to
her
face
she
rose
from
the
rocker
i
really
i
do
see
how
we
came
to
be
discussing
such
nonsense
she
said
our
ages
and
that
sort
of
thing
captain
cyrus
i
wish
you
would
go
to
washington
i
think
you
ought
to
but
the
captain
thoughts
were
far
from
washington
at
that
moment
his
own
face
was
alight
and
his
eyes
shone
phoebe
he
faltered
unbelievingly
what
was
you
goin
to
say
do
you
mean
that
that
the
side
door
of
the
house
opened
the
next
instant
tidditt
a
dripping
umbrella
in
his
hand
entered
the
sitting
room
hello
whit
he
hailed
just
run
in
for
a
minute
to
say
then
he
noticed
the
schoolmistress
and
his
expression
changed
oh
how
be
you
miss
dawes
he
said
i
did
see
you
fust
off
do
run
away
on
my
i
was
just
going
said
phoebe
buttoning
her
jacket
captain
cy
accompanied
her
to
the
door
she
said
there
was
something
else
i
meant
to
say
but
i
think
it
is
best
to
wait
i
hope
to
have
some
good
news
for
you
soon
something
that
will
send
you
to
washington
with
a
light
heart
perhaps
i
shall
hear
if
so
i
will
call
after
school
and
tell
yes
do
urged
the
captain
eagerly
you
find
me
here
waitin
good
news
or
not
do
come
i
i
ai
said
all
i
wanted
to
he
returned
to
the
sitting
room
the
town
clerk
was
standing
by
the
stove
he
looked
troubled
what
the
row
ase
asked
cy
cheerily
he
was
overflowing
with
good
nature
oh
nothin
special
replied
tidditt
you
look
joyful
enough
for
two
of
us
had
good
company
ai
you
why
yes
as
good
as
there
is
what
makes
you
look
so
glum
asaph
hesitated
phoebe
was
here
yesterday
too
wa
she
he
asked
yup
what
of
it
and
the
day
afore
that
no
not
for
three
days
afore
that
but
what
of
it
i
ask
you
well
now
cy
you
must
get
mad
i
a
friend
of
yours
and
friends
ought
to
be
able
to
say
anything
to
each
other
if
if
i
was
you
i
would
let
phoebe
come
so
often
not
here
you
know
at
your
house
course
i
know
she
comes
with
and
all
but
out
with
it
the
captain
tone
was
ominous
what
are
you
at
the
caller
fidgeted
well
whit
he
stammered
there
talkin
goin
on
that
talkin
what
kind
of
talkin
well
you
know
the
kind
this
town
does
a
good
deal
of
it
after
church
and
prayer
meetin
seem
if
they
thought
was
a
sort
of
proper
place
do
myself
i
kind
of
like
to
keep
my
charity
and
brotherly
love
spread
out
through
the
week
but
ase
are
the
folks
in
this
town
sayin
a
word
against
phoebe
dawes
because
she
comes
here
to
see
do
do
get
mad
whit
do
look
at
me
like
that
ai
said
nothin
why
a
spell
ago
at
the
boardin
house
i
he
told
of
the
meal
at
the
perfect
boarding
house
where
miss
dawes
championed
his
friend
cause
also
of
the
conversation
which
followed
and
his
own
part
in
it
captain
cy
paced
the
floor
i
would
have
her
come
so
often
cy
pleaded
asaph
honest
i
would
course
you
and
me
know
they
mean
liars
but
it
her
i
thinkin
of
she
a
young
woman
and
single
and
a
good
many
years
she
is
and
so
of
course
you
and
she
ever
goin
to
get
married
and
have
you
thought
what
effect
it
might
have
on
her
keepin
her
teacher
place
the
committee
a
majority
against
her
as
is
and
you
know
do
think
so
but
a
good
many
folks
do
you
ai
got
the
best
name
just
now
darn
it
all
i
puttin
this
the
way
i
ought
to
but
you
know
what
i
mean
do
you
cy
captain
cy
was
leaning
against
the
window
frame
his
head
upon
his
arm
he
was
not
looking
out
because
the
shade
was
drawn
tidditt
waited
anxiously
for
him
to
answer
at
last
he
turned
ase
he
said
i
much
obliged
to
you
you
pounded
it
in
pretty
hard
but
i
i
ought
to
have
had
it
done
to
me
i
a
fool
an
old
fool
just
as
i
said
a
while
back
and
nothin
nor
nobody
ought
to
have
made
me
forget
it
for
a
minute
or
so
i
but
there
do
you
fret
that
young
woman
sha
risk
her
job
nor
her
reputation
on
account
of
me
nor
of
either
i
see
to
that
and
see
here
he
added
fiercely
i
ca
stop
women
tongues
even
when
they
as
bad
as
some
of
the
tongues
in
this
town
but
if
you
hear
a
man
say
one
word
against
phoebe
dawes
only
one
word
you
tell
me
his
name
you
hear
ase
you
tell
me
his
name
now
run
along
will
you
i
ai
safe
company
just
asaph
frightened
at
the
effect
of
his
words
hurriedly
departed
captain
cy
paced
the
room
for
the
next
fifteen
minutes
then
he
opened
the
kitchen
door
he
called
come
in
and
set
in
my
lap
a
while
do
you
want
to
i
i
sort
of
lonesome
little
the
next
afternoon
when
the
schoolmistress
who
had
been
delayed
by
the
inevitable
examination
papers
stopped
at
the
cy
whittaker
place
she
was
met
by
georgianna
emily
who
stood
behind
the
housekeeper
in
the
doorway
was
crying
cy
has
gone
away
to
declared
georgianna
though
what
he
gone
there
for
i
know
he
said
he
send
his
hotel
address
soon
he
got
there
he
went
on
the
three
phoebe
was
astonished
gone
she
repeated
so
soon
why
he
told
me
he
should
certainly
be
here
to
hear
some
news
i
expected
did
he
leave
any
message
for
me
the
housekeeper
turned
red
miss
phoebe
she
said
he
told
me
to
tell
you
somethin
and
it
so
dreadful
i
do
hardly
dast
to
say
it
i
think
his
troubles
have
driven
him
crazy
he
said
to
tell
you
that
you
better
not
come
to
this
house
any
chapter
xviii
congressman
everdean
in
the
old
days
the
great
days
of
sailing
ships
and
land
merchant
fleets
bayport
was
a
community
of
travelers
every
ambitious
man
went
to
sea
and
eventually
if
he
lived
became
a
captain
then
he
took
his
wife
and
in
most
cases
his
children
with
him
on
long
voyages
to
the
came
letters
with
odd
foreign
stamps
and
postmarks
our
and
parlor
mantels
were
filled
with
carved
bits
of
ivory
gorgeous
shells
alabaster
candlesticks
and
plaster
miniatures
of
the
leaning
tower
at
pisa
or
the
coliseum
at
rome
we
usually
began
a
conversation
with
when
my
husband
and
i
were
at
hong
kong
the
last
time
or
i
remember
at
mauritius
they
always
new
orleans
or
were
the
nearest
domestic
ports
the
mention
of
which
was
considered
worth
while
but
this
is
so
no
longer
a
trip
to
boston
is
of
course
no
novelty
to
the
most
of
us
but
when
we
visit
new
york
we
take
care
to
advertise
it
beforehand
and
the
few
who
avail
themselves
of
the
spring
cut
rates
and
go
on
excursions
to
washington
plan
definite
programmes
for
each
day
at
the
capital
and
discuss
them
with
envious
friends
for
weeks
in
advance
and
if
the
prearranged
programme
is
not
scrupulously
carried
out
we
feel
that
we
have
been
defrauded
it
was
the
regret
of
aunt
sophronia
hallett
life
that
on
her
washington
excursion
she
had
not
seen
the
diplomatic
she
saw
the
president
and
the
monument
and
congress
and
the
relics
in
the
smithsonian
institute
but
the
corpse
was
not
on
view
aunt
sophronia
never
quite
got
over
the
disappointment
probably
no
other
bayporter
in
recent
years
has
started
for
washington
on
such
short
notice
or
with
so
a
programme
as
captain
cy
he
went
because
he
felt
that
he
must
go
somewhere
after
the
conversation
with
asaph
he
simply
could
not
remain
at
home
if
phoebe
dawes
called
he
knew
that
he
must
see
her
and
if
he
saw
her
what
should
he
say
to
her
he
could
not
tell
her
that
she
must
not
visit
the
cy
whittaker
place
again
if
he
did
she
would
insist
upon
the
reason
if
he
told
her
of
the
town
talk
he
felt
sure
knowing
her
that
she
would
indignantly
refuse
to
heed
the
malicious
gossip
and
he
was
firmly
resolved
not
to
permit
her
to
compromise
her
life
and
her
future
by
friendship
with
a
social
outcast
like
himself
as
for
anything
deeper
and
more
sacred
than
friendship
that
was
ridiculous
if
for
a
moment
a
remark
of
hers
had
led
him
to
dream
of
such
a
thing
it
was
because
he
was
as
he
had
so
often
declared
an
old
so
captain
cy
had
resolved
upon
flight
and
he
fled
to
washington
because
the
business
of
the
committee
of
one
offered
a
legitimate
excuse
for
going
there
the
blunt
message
he
had
intrusted
to
georgianna
would
he
believed
arouse
phoebe
indignation
she
would
not
call
again
and
when
he
returned
to
it
would
be
to
take
up
the
fight
alone
if
he
lost
that
fight
or
when
he
lost
it
he
would
close
the
cy
whittaker
place
and
leave
bayport
for
good
he
had
been
in
washington
once
before
years
ago
when
he
was
first
mate
of
a
ship
and
had
a
few
weeks
shore
leave
then
he
went
there
on
a
pleasure
trip
with
some
seagoing
friends
and
had
a
jolly
time
but
there
was
precious
little
jollity
in
the
present
visit
he
had
never
felt
so
thoroughly
miserable
in
order
to
forget
he
made
up
his
mind
to
work
his
hardest
to
discover
why
the
harbor
appropriation
was
not
to
be
given
to
bayport
the
city
had
changed
greatly
he
would
scarcely
have
known
it
he
went
to
the
hotel
where
he
had
stayed
before
and
found
a
big
modern
building
in
its
place
the
clerk
was
inclined
to
be
rather
curt
and
perfunctory
at
first
but
when
he
learned
that
the
captain
was
not
anxious
concerning
the
price
of
accommodations
but
merely
wanted
a
berth
somewheres
on
the
saloon
deck
and
appeared
to
have
plenty
of
money
he
grew
polite
captain
cy
was
shown
to
his
room
where
he
left
his
valise
then
he
went
down
to
dinner
after
the
meal
was
over
he
seated
himself
in
one
of
the
big
leather
chairs
in
the
hotel
lobby
smoked
and
thought
in
the
summer
before
came
and
before
her
father
had
arisen
to
upset
every
calculation
and
wreck
all
his
plans
the
captain
had
given
serious
thought
to
what
he
should
do
if
congressman
atkins
failed
as
even
then
he
seemed
likely
to
do
in
securing
that
appropriation
the
obvious
thing
of
course
would
have
been
to
hunt
up
atkins
and
question
him
but
this
was
altogether
too
obvious
in
the
first
place
the
strained
relations
between
them
would
make
the
interview
uncomfortable
and
in
the
second
if
there
was
anything
underhand
in
heman
backsliding
on
the
appropriation
atkins
was
too
wary
a
bird
to
be
snared
with
questions
but
captain
cy
had
another
acquaintance
in
the
city
the
son
of
a
still
older
acquaintance
who
had
been
a
wealthy
shipping
merchant
and
mine
owner
in
california
the
son
was
also
a
congressman
from
a
coast
state
and
the
captain
had
read
of
him
in
the
papers
a
sketch
of
his
life
had
been
printed
and
this
made
his
identity
absolutely
certain
captain
cy
original
idea
had
been
to
write
to
this
congressman
now
he
determined
to
find
and
interview
him
he
inquired
concerning
him
of
the
hotel
clerk
who
like
all
washington
clerks
was
a
walking
edition
of
who
who
at
the
congressman
everdean
repeated
the
young
gentleman
yes
he
in
town
has
rooms
at
the
gloria
second
hotel
on
the
right
as
you
go
up
the
avenue
only
a
short
walk
what
can
i
do
for
you
sir
the
gloria
was
an
even
bigger
hotel
than
the
one
where
the
captain
had
his
an
inquiry
at
the
desk
of
another
important
clerk
was
answered
with
a
brisk
mr
everdean
yes
he
rooms
here
do
know
whether
he
in
or
not
evening
judge
nice
winter
weather
we
the
judge
who
was
a
ponderous
person
vaguely
suggesting
the
great
heman
admitted
that
the
weather
was
fine
patronizing
it
as
he
did
so
the
clerk
continued
the
conversation
captain
cy
waited
at
length
he
spoke
excuse
me
commodore
he
said
i
do
like
to
break
in
until
settled
whether
you
have
it
snow
or
not
but
i
here
to
see
congressman
everdean
had
you
better
order
one
of
your
hands
to
hunt
him
up
the
judge
condescended
to
smile
as
did
several
other
men
who
stood
near
the
clerk
reddened
do
you
want
to
see
everdean
he
snapped
why
yes
i
did
but
i
ca
see
him
from
here
without
strainin
my
the
clerk
sharply
demanded
one
of
the
captain
visiting
cards
he
did
get
one
for
the
very
good
reason
that
there
was
none
in
existence
tell
him
an
old
friend
of
his
dad
is
here
on
the
main
deck
for
him
said
captain
cy
that
do
first
rate
thank
you
word
came
that
the
congressman
would
be
down
in
a
few
moments
the
captain
beguiled
the
interval
by
leaning
on
the
rail
and
regarding
the
clerk
with
an
awed
curiosity
that
annoyed
its
object
exceedingly
the
inspection
was
still
on
when
a
tall
man
of
an
age
somewhere
in
the
early
thirties
walked
briskly
up
to
the
desk
who
is
it
that
wants
to
see
me
he
asked
the
clerk
waved
a
deprecatory
hand
in
captain
cy
direction
the
newcomer
turned
my
name
is
everdean
he
said
are
you
hey
great
scott
is
it
possible
this
is
captain
whittaker
the
captain
was
immensely
pleased
well
i
declare
ed
he
exclaimed
i
did
believe
you
remember
me
after
all
these
years
you
was
nothin
but
a
boy
when
i
saw
you
out
in
well
well
no
wonder
you
in
congress
a
man
that
can
remember
faces
like
that
ought
to
be
everdean
laughed
as
they
shook
hands
do
suppose
i
forget
the
chap
who
used
to
dine
with
us
and
tell
me
those
sea
stories
do
you
he
said
i
mighty
glad
to
see
you
what
are
you
doing
here
the
last
father
and
i
heard
of
you
you
were
in
south
america
given
up
the
sea
they
said
and
getting
rich
captain
cy
chuckled
it
a
good
thing
i
learned
long
ago
not
to
believe
all
i
hear
he
answered
else
i
have
been
so
sure
i
was
rich
that
i
have
spent
all
i
had
and
been
permanent
boarder
at
the
poorhouse
by
now
no
thanks
i
had
dinner
why
yes
i
smoke
if
you
help
along
how
your
father
smart
is
he
the
congressman
insisted
that
they
should
adjourn
to
his
rooms
an
unmarried
man
he
kept
bachelor
hall
at
the
hotel
during
his
stay
in
washington
there
in
comfortable
chairs
they
spoke
of
old
times
when
the
captain
was
seafaring
and
the
everdean
home
had
been
his
while
his
ship
was
in
port
at
he
told
of
his
return
to
bayport
and
the
renovation
of
the
old
house
of
he
said
nothing
at
last
everdean
asked
what
had
brought
him
to
washington
well
said
captain
cy
i
tell
you
i
like
the
feller
in
court
without
a
lawyer
he
said
he
could
tell
whether
he
was
guilty
or
not
of
havin
no
professional
advice
that
what
i
come
to
you
for
ed
professional
he
told
the
harbor
appropriation
story
at
the
incident
of
the
committee
of
one
his
friend
laughed
heartily
rather
put
your
foot
in
it
that
time
captain
did
you
he
said
yup
then
i
got
one
stuck
tryin
to
get
the
first
clear
it
look
to
you
all
straight
do
you
think
or
is
there
a
nigger
in
the
wood
pile
everdean
seemed
to
reflect
well
captain
he
said
i
ca
tell
you
asking
delicate
questions
politicians
are
like
doctors
they
usually
back
up
each
other
opinions
still
you
at
least
as
good
a
friend
of
mine
as
atkins
is
queer
he
should
bob
up
in
this
matter
why
he
but
never
mind
that
now
i
tell
you
captain
whittaker
you
come
around
and
have
dinner
with
me
night
in
the
meantime
i
see
the
chairman
of
the
committee
on
that
bill
one
of
the
bills
it
is
possibly
from
him
and
some
other
acquaintances
of
mine
i
may
learn
something
at
any
rate
you
come
to
so
the
invitation
was
accepted
and
captain
cy
went
back
to
his
own
hotel
and
his
room
he
slept
but
little
although
it
was
not
worry
over
the
appropriation
question
which
kept
him
awake
next
morning
he
wrote
a
note
to
georgianna
giving
his
washington
address
with
it
he
enclosed
a
long
letter
to
telling
her
he
should
be
home
pretty
soon
and
that
she
must
be
a
good
girl
and
boss
the
ship
during
his
absence
he
sent
his
regards
to
asaph
and
bailey
but
phoebe
name
he
did
not
mention
then
he
put
in
a
miserable
day
wandering
about
the
city
at
eight
that
evening
he
and
his
western
friend
sat
down
at
a
corner
table
in
the
big
dining
room
of
the
gloria
the
captain
began
to
ask
questions
as
soon
as
the
soup
was
served
but
everdean
refused
to
answer
no
no
he
said
pleasure
first
and
business
afterwards
that
a
congressional
motto
i
ca
talk
atkins
with
my
dinner
and
enjoy
ca
hey
you
would
be
popular
at
our
perfect
boarding
house
back
home
there
they
serve
heman
hot
for
breakfast
and
dinner
and
warm
him
over
for
supper
all
right
i
can
the
conversation
wandered
from
buenos
ayres
to
and
back
again
until
the
cigars
and
coffee
were
reached
then
the
congressman
blew
a
fragrant
ring
into
the
air
and
from
behind
it
looked
quizzically
at
his
companion
well
he
observed
so
far
as
that
appropriation
of
yours
is
concerned
he
paused
and
blew
a
second
ring
captain
cy
stroked
his
beard
um
yes
he
drawled
now
that
you
mention
it
seems
to
me
there
was
some
talk
of
an
everdean
laughed
i
been
making
inquiries
he
said
i
saw
the
chairman
of
the
committee
on
the
pork
bill
i
know
him
well
he
a
good
fellow
but
yes
i
know
i
seen
lots
of
politicians
like
that
they
all
good
fellers
but
if
i
was
in
politics
i
make
a
law
to
cut
out
of
the
well
this
chap
really
is
a
good
fellow
i
asked
about
the
thirty
thousand
dollars
for
your
town
he
asked
me
why
i
did
go
to
the
congressman
from
that
district
and
not
bother
him
about
it
i
said
perhaps
i
would
go
to
the
congressman
later
but
i
came
to
him
sartin
same
as
the
feller
with
a
sick
stopped
in
at
the
undertaker
on
his
way
to
call
the
doctor
all
right
heave
well
we
had
a
rather
long
conversation
i
discovered
that
the
bayport
item
was
originally
included
in
the
bill
but
recently
had
been
stricken
yes
i
see
uncle
sam
had
to
economize
hey
save
somethin
for
a
rainy
well
possibly
still
the
bill
is
just
as
heavy
now
captain
whittaker
i
do
know
anything
about
this
affair
and
it
not
my
business
but
i
been
about
and
i
asked
questions
and
going
to
tell
you
a
fairy
tale
it
is
as
interesting
as
your
sea
yarns
but
do
you
like
fairy
stories
land
yes
tell
a
few
myself
when
it
necessary
sometimes
i
almost
believe
well
of
course
you
must
remember
this
is
a
fairy
story
let
suppose
that
once
on
a
time
that
the
way
they
always
begin
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
great
man
great
in
his
own
country
who
was
sent
abroad
by
his
people
to
represent
them
among
the
rulers
of
the
land
so
in
order
to
typically
represent
them
he
dressed
in
glad
and
expensive
raiment
went
about
in
dignity
and
and
whiskers
do
leave
out
the
whiskers
all
right
and
whiskers
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
whom
he
represented
wished
to
to
er
bring
about
a
certain
needed
improvement
in
their
their
beautiful
and
enterprising
sho
sho
how
natural
that
sounds
you
must
be
a
mind
no
but
i
have
to
make
speeches
in
my
own
community
occasionally
well
the
people
asked
their
great
man
to
get
the
money
needed
for
this
improvement
from
the
rulers
of
the
land
aforementioned
and
he
was
at
first
all
enthusiasm
and
upon
the
the
parchment
scroll
where
such
matters
are
inscribed
was
written
the
name
of
the
beautiful
and
enterprising
community
and
the
sum
of
money
it
asked
for
and
the
deal
was
as
good
as
made
excuse
the
modern
phraseology
my
fairy
lingo
got
mixed
never
mind
i
can
get
the
drift
just
as
well
maybe
and
the
deal
was
as
good
as
made
but
before
the
vote
was
taken
another
chap
came
to
the
great
man
and
said
here
i
want
to
get
an
appropriation
of
say
fifty
thousand
dollars
to
deepen
and
improve
a
river
down
in
my
state
a
southern
state
we
say
been
to
the
chairman
of
the
pork
bill
committee
and
he
says
it
impossible
the
bill
simply
ca
be
loaded
any
further
but
i
find
that
you
have
an
item
in
there
for
deepening
and
improving
a
harbor
back
in
your
own
district
why
do
you
cut
that
item
out
shove
it
over
until
next
year
you
can
easily
find
a
satisfactory
explanation
for
your
constituents
and
you
want
to
remember
this
the
improvement
of
this
river
means
that
the
the
well
a
certain
company
can
get
their
stuff
to
market
at
a
figure
which
will
send
its
stock
up
and
up
and
you
are
said
to
own
a
considerable
amount
of
that
stock
so
why
not
drop
the
harbor
item
and
substitute
my
river
slice
then
well
i
guess
that
the
end
of
the
he
paused
and
relit
his
cigar
captain
cy
thoughtfully
marked
with
his
fork
on
the
tablecloth
hum
he
grunted
that
a
very
interestin
yarn
yes
yes
know
i
ever
heard
a
more
interestin
one
i
presume
likely
there
a
mite
of
proof
that
it
true
not
an
atom
i
told
you
it
was
a
fairy
tale
and
i
must
be
quoted
in
the
matter
honestly
the
most
of
it
is
guess
work
at
that
but
perhaps
a
of
one
dropping
a
hint
at
home
might
at
least
arouse
some
uncomfortable
questioning
of
a
certain
great
man
that
about
all
though
proof
is
quite
another
the
captain
pondered
he
was
fully
aware
that
the
unpopularity
of
the
committee
would
nullify
whatever
good
its
hinting
might
do
humph
he
grunted
again
it
one
thing
to
smell
a
rat
and
another
to
nail
its
tail
to
the
floor
but
i
mighty
obliged
to
you
all
the
same
and
i
think
it
over
hard
say
i
can
see
one
thing
you
do
take
a
very
big
shine
to
heman
not
too
big
no
do
you
well
i
do
wake
up
nights
and
cry
for
everdean
laughed
that
characteristic
he
said
you
have
your
own
way
of
putting
things
captain
and
it
hard
to
be
improved
on
atkins
has
never
done
anything
to
me
i
just
i
just
do
like
him
that
all
father
never
liked
him
either
in
the
old
days
and
yet
and
it
odd
too
he
was
the
means
of
the
old
gentleman
making
the
most
of
his
he
who
not
heman
yes
heman
atkins
but
so
far
as
that
goes
father
started
him
toward
wealth
i
suppose
at
least
he
was
poor
enough
before
the
mine
was
what
are
you
talkin
about
heman
got
his
start
tradin
over
in
the
south
seas
sellin
the
kanakas
glass
beads
and
calico
for
pearls
and
copra
two
cupfuls
of
pearls
for
every
bead
anyhow
that
the
way
the
yarn
i
ca
help
that
he
was
just
a
common
sailor
who
had
run
away
from
his
ship
and
was
gold
mining
in
california
and
when
he
and
his
partner
struck
it
rich
father
borrowed
money
headed
a
company
and
bought
them
out
that
mine
was
the
excelsior
and
it
just
as
productive
as
it
ever
was
i
rather
think
atkins
must
be
very
sorry
he
sold
i
suppose
by
right
i
should
be
very
grateful
to
your
distinguished
well
i
do
declare
sho
sho
ai
that
funny
now
he
never
said
a
word
about
it
at
home
i
do
believe
there
a
soul
in
bayport
knows
that
we
all
thought
was
south
sea
tradin
that
boosted
heman
and
your
own
dad
i
declare
this
is
a
small
world
it
odd
father
never
told
you
about
it
it
one
of
the
old
gentleman
pet
stories
he
came
west
in
and
was
running
a
little
shipping
store
in
he
met
atkins
and
the
other
young
sailor
his
partner
before
they
left
their
ship
they
were
in
the
store
buying
various
things
and
father
got
to
know
them
pretty
well
then
they
ran
away
to
the
diggings
you
simply
could
keep
a
crew
in
those
times
and
he
did
see
them
again
for
a
good
while
then
they
came
in
one
day
and
showed
him
specimens
from
a
claim
they
had
back
in
the
mountains
they
were
mighty
good
specimens
and
what
they
said
about
the
claim
convinced
father
that
they
had
a
valuable
property
so
he
went
to
see
a
few
friends
of
his
and
the
outcome
was
that
a
party
was
made
up
to
go
and
inspect
the
young
fellows
were
willing
to
sell
out
for
it
was
a
quartz
working
and
they
had
the
money
to
carry
it
on
the
inspection
showed
that
the
claim
was
likely
to
be
even
better
than
they
thought
so
after
some
bargaining
the
deal
was
completed
they
sold
out
for
thousand
dollars
and
it
was
the
best
trade
father
ever
made
he
so
proud
of
his
judgment
and
foresight
in
making
it
that
i
wonder
he
never
told
you
the
he
never
did
when
was
this
in
what
i
did
speak
the
date
seemed
kind
of
familiar
to
me
that
all
seem
as
if
i
heard
it
recent
but
i
ca
remember
when
thousand
hey
well
that
wa
so
bad
was
it
with
that
for
a
nest
egg
no
wonder
heman
managed
to
hatch
a
pretty
respectable
brood
of
oh
the
whole
was
his
of
course
half
belonged
to
his
partner
but
the
poor
devil
did
live
to
enjoy
it
after
the
articles
were
signed
and
before
the
money
was
paid
over
he
was
taken
sick
with
a
fever
and
hey
he
died
with
a
fever
yes
but
he
left
a
pretty
good
legacy
to
his
heirs
did
he
for
a
common
sailor
or
second
mate
i
believe
that
what
he
was
thousand
five
hundred
is
doing
well
it
must
have
come
as
a
big
surprise
to
them
the
whole
sum
was
paid
to
atkins
who
the
matter
with
you
captain
cy
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
he
was
as
white
as
the
tablecloth
are
you
ill
asked
the
congressman
anxiously
take
some
water
shall
i
call
the
captain
waved
his
hand
no
no
he
stammered
no
i
all
right
do
you
for
the
lord
sake
tell
me
this
what
was
the
name
of
this
partner
that
died
everdean
looked
curiously
at
his
friend
before
he
answered
sure
you
not
sick
he
asked
well
all
right
the
partner
name
why
i
heard
it
often
enough
it
on
the
deed
of
sale
that
father
has
framed
in
his
room
at
home
the
old
gentleman
is
as
proud
of
that
as
anything
in
the
house
the
name
was
was
for
god
sakes
cried
captain
cy
do
say
was
john
thayer
if
you
do
i
sha
believe
that
what
it
was
john
thayer
how
did
you
guess
did
you
know
him
i
remember
now
that
he
was
another
down
easter
like
the
captain
did
not
answer
he
clasped
his
forehead
with
both
hands
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
everdean
was
plainly
alarmed
i
going
to
call
a
doctor
he
began
rising
but
captain
cy
waved
him
back
again
set
still
he
ordered
set
still
i
tell
you
you
say
the
whole
thousand
was
paid
to
heman
but
that
john
thayer
signed
the
bill
of
sale
afore
he
died
as
half
partner
and
your
dad
got
the
original
deed
and
and
he
remembers
the
whole
business
yes
he
got
the
deed
framed
it
on
record
too
of
course
remembers
i
should
say
he
did
he
talk
for
a
week
on
that
subject
if
you
give
him
a
the
captain
sprang
to
his
feet
his
chair
tipped
backward
and
fell
to
the
floor
an
obsequious
waiter
ran
to
right
it
but
captain
cy
paid
no
attention
to
him
where
my
coat
he
demanded
where
my
coat
and
hat
what
ails
you
asked
everdean
are
you
going
crazy
goin
crazy
no
no
i
goin
to
california
when
the
next
train
chapter
xix
the
toppling
of
a
monument
the
honorable
heman
atkins
sat
in
the
library
of
his
washington
home
before
a
snapping
log
fire
reading
a
letter
atkins
had
as
he
would
have
expressed
it
served
his
people
in
congress
for
so
many
years
that
he
had
long
since
passed
the
hotel
stage
of
living
at
the
capital
he
rented
a
furnished
house
on
an
eminently
respectable
street
and
the
polished
doorplate
bore
his
name
in
uncompromising
characters
the
library
furniture
was
solid
and
dignified
its
businesslike
appearance
impressed
the
stray
excursionist
from
the
atkins
district
when
he
or
she
visited
the
great
man
in
whose
affairs
we
felt
such
a
personal
interest
particularly
impressive
and
significant
was
a
map
of
the
district
hanging
over
the
congressman
desk
and
an
oil
painting
of
the
atkins
mansion
at
bayport
which
with
the
iron
dogs
and
urns
conspicuous
in
its
foreground
occupied
the
middle
of
the
largest
wall
space
the
cheery
fire
was
very
comforting
on
a
night
like
this
for
the
sleet
was
driving
against
the
windowpanes
the
sidewalks
were
ankle
deep
in
slush
and
the
wet
cold
wind
from
the
potomac
was
whistling
down
the
street
somewhere
about
the
house
an
unfastened
shutter
slammed
in
the
gusts
atkins
should
have
been
extremely
comfortable
as
he
sat
there
by
the
fire
he
had
spent
many
comfortable
winters
in
that
room
but
now
there
was
a
frown
on
his
face
as
he
read
the
letter
in
his
hand
it
was
from
simpson
and
stated
among
other
things
that
cyrus
whittaker
had
been
absent
from
bayport
for
over
two
weeks
and
that
no
one
seemed
to
know
where
he
had
gone
the
idea
seems
to
be
that
he
started
for
washington
wrote
tad
but
if
that
is
so
it
is
queer
you
seen
him
i
am
suspicious
that
he
is
up
to
something
about
that
harbor
business
i
should
keep
my
eye
peeled
if
i
was
alicia
the
atkins
hopeful
rustled
into
the
room
papa
she
said
i
come
to
kiss
you
good
her
father
performed
the
ceremony
in
a
perfunctory
way
all
right
all
right
he
said
now
run
along
to
bed
and
do
bother
me
there
a
good
girl
i
wish
he
added
testily
to
the
housekeeper
who
had
followed
alicia
into
the
room
i
wish
you
see
to
that
loose
blind
it
makes
me
nervous
such
things
as
that
should
be
attended
to
without
specific
orders
from
the
housekeeper
promised
to
attend
to
the
blind
she
and
the
girl
left
the
library
heman
reread
the
simpson
letter
then
he
dropped
it
in
his
lap
and
sat
thinking
and
twirling
his
eyeglasses
at
the
end
of
their
black
cord
his
thoughts
seemed
to
be
not
of
the
pleasantest
the
lines
about
his
mouth
had
deepened
during
the
last
few
months
he
looked
older
the
telephone
bell
rang
sharply
atkins
came
out
of
his
reverie
with
a
start
arose
and
walked
across
the
room
to
the
wall
where
the
instrument
hung
it
was
before
the
days
of
the
convenient
desk
he
took
the
receiver
from
its
hook
and
spoke
into
the
transmitter
hello
he
said
hello
yes
yes
stop
ringing
what
is
it
the
wire
buzzed
and
purred
in
the
storm
hello
said
a
voice
hello
there
is
this
atkins
house
yes
it
is
what
do
you
want
hey
is
this
where
the
honorable
heman
atkins
lives
yes
yes
i
tell
you
this
is
atkins
speaking
what
do
you
want
oh
is
that
you
heman
this
is
whittaker
cy
whittaker
understand
atkins
understood
yet
for
an
instant
he
did
not
reply
he
had
been
thinking
as
he
sat
by
the
fire
of
certain
persons
and
certain
ugly
though
remote
possibilities
now
from
a
mysterious
somewhere
one
of
those
persons
was
speaking
to
him
the
hand
holding
the
receiver
shook
momentarily
hello
i
say
heman
do
you
understand
this
is
whittaker
i
er
understand
said
the
congressman
slowly
well
sir
i
here
in
i
have
been
informed
that
you
were
in
the
city
well
sir
oh
knew
i
was
here
did
you
is
that
so
who
told
you
tad
wrote
i
suppose
hey
the
congressman
did
not
reply
immediately
this
man
whom
he
disliked
more
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
had
an
irritating
faculty
of
putting
his
finger
on
the
truth
and
the
flippancy
in
the
tone
was
maddening
atkins
was
not
used
to
flippancy
i
believe
i
am
not
called
upon
to
disclose
my
source
of
information
he
said
with
chilling
dignity
it
appears
to
have
been
trustworthy
i
presume
you
have
me
concerning
the
appropriation
matter
i
do
not
recognize
your
right
to
intrude
in
that
affair
and
i
shall
decline
to
discuss
it
yes
sir
to
my
people
to
those
who
have
a
right
to
question
i
am
and
shall
always
be
willing
to
explain
my
position
good
wait
hello
hold
on
a
minute
do
get
mad
heman
i
only
wanted
to
say
just
a
word
you
let
me
say
a
word
wo
you
this
was
more
like
it
this
was
more
nearly
the
tone
in
which
atkins
was
wont
to
be
addressed
it
was
possible
that
the
man
recognizing
the
uselessness
of
further
opposition
desired
to
surrender
i
can
not
declared
the
honorable
understand
why
you
should
wish
to
speak
with
me
we
have
very
little
in
common
very
little
i
thankful
to
say
however
i
will
hear
you
briefly
go
much
obliged
well
heman
i
only
wanted
to
say
that
i
thought
maybe
you
better
have
a
little
talk
with
me
i
here
at
the
hotel
the
regent
you
know
where
is
i
presume
likely
i
guess
you
better
come
right
down
and
see
heman
gasped
actually
gasped
with
astonishment
had
better
come
and
see
you
i
well
sir
well
i
am
not
accustomed
i
know
but
i
think
you
better
it
dirty
weather
and
i
got
cold
somehow
or
other
i
ai
feelin
quite
up
to
the
mark
so
i
i
stay
in
port
much
as
i
can
you
come
right
down
i
be
in
my
room
and
the
hotel
folks
tell
you
where
is
i
be
waitin
for
atkins
breathed
hard
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
he
would
have
liked
to
deliver
a
blast
into
that
transmitter
which
would
cause
the
person
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
to
shrivel
under
its
heat
but
he
was
a
politician
of
long
training
and
he
knew
that
such
blasts
were
sometimes
expensive
treats
it
might
be
well
to
hear
what
his
enemy
had
to
say
but
as
to
going
to
see
him
that
was
out
of
the
question
i
do
not
he
thundered
i
do
not
care
to
continue
this
conversation
if
if
you
wish
to
see
me
after
what
has
taken
place
between
us
i
am
willing
in
spite
of
personal
repugnance
to
grant
you
a
brief
interview
my
servants
will
admit
you
here
at
nine
morning
but
i
tell
you
now
that
your
interference
with
this
appropriation
matter
is
as
useless
as
it
is
ridiculous
and
impudent
it
is
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
of
your
all
right
heman
all
right
was
the
calm
answer
i
do
say
got
to
come
i
only
say
i
guess
you
better
i
goin
back
to
bayport
tomorrer
early
and
if
i
was
you
i
come
and
see
me
i
have
no
wish
to
see
you
nor
do
i
care
to
talk
with
you
further
that
appropriation
maybe
it
ai
all
then
i
can
not
understand
i
know
but
understand
i
come
to
understand
many
things
in
the
last
there
i
ca
holler
into
this
machine
any
longer
i
been
clear
out
to
and
back
in
eleven
days
and
i
got
cold
in
those
blessed
sleepin
cars
i
the
receiver
fell
from
the
congressman
hand
it
was
a
difficult
object
to
pick
up
again
heman
groped
for
it
in
a
blind
strangely
inadequate
way
yet
he
wished
to
recover
it
very
much
wait
wait
he
shouted
anxiously
i
i
i
dropped
the
are
you
there
whittaker
are
you
oh
yes
i
did
did
you
say
er
yes
san
francisco
california
i
been
west
on
a
little
cruise
had
an
interestin
time
it
an
interestin
place
do
you
think
so
well
i
sorry
you
ca
come
good
wait
faltered
the
great
man
i
i
let
me
think
cyrus
i
do
not
wish
to
seem
er
arrogant
in
this
matter
it
is
not
usual
for
me
to
visit
my
constituents
but
but
i
have
no
engagement
this
evening
and
you
are
not
well
and
hello
are
you
there
hello
why
under
the
circumstances
i
think
yes
i
will
come
i
come
er
at
the
telephone
enables
one
to
procure
a
cab
in
a
short
time
yet
to
heman
atkins
that
cab
was
years
in
coming
he
paced
the
library
floor
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
his
brain
whirling
it
could
be
it
must
be
a
coincidence
he
had
been
an
idiot
to
display
his
agitation
and
surrender
so
weakly
and
yet
and
yet
the
ride
through
the
storm
to
the
regent
hotel
gave
him
opportunity
for
more
thought
but
he
gained
little
comfort
from
thinking
if
it
was
a
coincidence
well
and
good
if
not
a
bell
boy
conducted
him
to
the
whittaker
room
on
the
saloon
it
was
a
small
room
very
different
from
the
atkins
library
and
captain
cy
in
a
chair
was
huddled
close
to
the
steam
radiator
he
looked
far
from
well
evenin
heman
he
said
as
the
congressman
entered
pretty
dirty
night
ai
it
what
we
call
a
gray
back
home
sit
down
do
mind
my
not
gettin
up
this
heatin
arrangement
feels
mighty
just
now
if
i
get
too
far
away
from
it
i
shiver
my
deck
planks
loose
take
off
your
atkins
did
not
remove
his
overcoat
his
hat
he
tossed
on
the
bed
he
glanced
fearfully
at
his
companion
the
latter
greeting
had
been
so
casual
and
everyday
that
he
took
courage
and
the
captain
looked
anything
but
formidable
as
he
hugged
the
radiator
perhaps
things
were
not
so
bad
as
he
had
feared
he
resolved
not
to
seem
alarmed
at
all
events
have
a
cigar
heman
said
captain
cy
no
well
all
right
i
will
if
you
do
he
lit
the
cigar
the
congressman
cleared
his
throat
cyrus
he
said
i
am
not
accustomed
to
run
at
the
beck
and
call
of
my
er
acquaintances
but
even
though
we
have
disagreed
of
late
even
though
to
me
your
conduct
seems
quite
unjustifiable
still
for
the
sake
of
our
boyhood
friendship
and
because
you
are
not
well
i
er
captain
cy
coughed
spasmodically
a
cough
that
seemed
to
be
tearing
him
to
pieces
he
looked
at
his
cigar
regretfully
and
laid
it
on
the
top
of
the
radiator
too
bad
he
observed
tobacco
iles
up
my
talkin
machinery
but
just
now
it
seems
to
make
me
bark
like
a
ship
dog
shut
up
in
the
hold
why
yes
heman
i
see
you
come
much
obliged
to
this
politeness
was
still
more
encouraging
atkins
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
crossed
his
legs
i
presume
he
said
that
you
wish
to
ask
concerning
the
appropriation
i
regret
you
need
i
guess
we
get
the
heman
condescension
vanished
he
leaned
forward
and
uncrossed
his
legs
indeed
he
said
slowly
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
captain
placid
face
yes
whittaker
what
are
you
talking
about
do
you
suppose
that
i
have
been
the
representative
of
my
people
in
congress
all
these
years
without
knowing
whereof
i
speak
they
left
the
matter
in
my
hands
and
your
interference
i
ai
goin
to
interfere
i
goin
to
leave
it
in
your
hands
too
and
i
you
be
able
to
find
a
way
to
get
it
um
hum
i
guess
likely
you
the
visitor
rose
to
his
feet
the
time
had
come
for
another
blast
from
olympus
he
raised
the
mighty
right
arm
but
captain
cy
spoke
first
sit
down
heman
said
the
captain
quietly
sit
down
this
ai
town
meetin
never
mind
the
appropriation
now
there
other
matters
to
be
talked
about
first
sit
down
i
tell
atkins
was
purple
in
the
face
but
he
sat
down
the
captain
coughed
again
heman
he
began
when
the
spasm
was
over
i
asked
you
to
come
here
for
well
blessed
if
i
know
exactly
it
did
make
much
difference
to
me
whether
you
came
or
then
sir
i
must
say
that
of
all
the
impudent
for
the
land
sakes
speechmakin
must
be
as
bad
as
the
rum
habit
when
a
feller
got
it
chronic
as
you
have
no
it
did
make
much
difference
to
me
whether
you
came
or
not
but
honest
you
got
to
be
a
kind
of
bunker
hill
monument
to
the
folks
back
home
they
kneel
down
at
your
foundations
and
look
up
at
you
and
tell
each
other
how
many
foot
high
you
are
and
what
it
cost
to
build
you
and
how
you
stand
for
patriotism
and
purity
till
well
could
see
you
tumble
down
without
givin
you
a
chance
i
could
be
like
blowin
up
a
the
purple
had
left
the
atkins
face
but
the
speechmaking
habit
is
not
likely
to
be
broken
cyrus
whittaker
he
stammered
have
you
been
drinking
your
language
to
me
is
abominable
why
i
permit
myself
to
remain
here
and
listen
to
such
if
you
keep
still
i
tell
you
why
and
if
i
was
you
i
be
too
anxious
to
find
out
this
everlastin
cold
do
make
me
over
above
and
when
i
think
of
what
you
done
to
that
little
girl
or
what
you
tried
to
do
i
have
to
hold
myself
down
tight
tight
and
do
you
forget
it
now
you
keep
quiet
and
listen
it
be
best
for
you
heman
your
cards
ai
under
the
table
any
longer
i
seen
your
hand
and
i
know
why
you
been
playin
it
i
know
the
whole
game
i
been
west
and
everdean
and
i
have
had
a
atkins
had
again
risen
from
the
chair
now
he
fell
heavily
back
into
it
his
lips
moved
as
if
he
meant
to
speak
but
he
did
not
at
the
mention
of
the
everdean
name
he
made
a
queer
choking
sound
in
his
throat
i
know
the
whole
business
heman
went
on
the
captain
i
know
why
you
was
so
knocked
over
when
you
learned
who
was
the
night
of
the
party
i
know
why
you
took
up
with
that
blackguard
thomas
and
why
you
spent
your
good
money
hirin
lawyers
for
him
i
know
about
the
mine
i
know
the
whole
thing
from
first
to
last
shall
i
tell
you
do
you
want
to
hear
it
the
great
man
did
not
answer
a
drop
of
perspiration
shone
on
his
high
forehead
and
the
veins
of
his
big
white
hands
stood
out
as
he
clutched
the
arms
of
his
chair
the
monument
was
tottering
on
its
base
it
a
dirty
mess
the
whole
of
it
continued
captain
cy
and
yet
i
can
see
i
suppose
i
can
see
some
excuse
for
you
at
the
beginnin
when
old
man
everdean
and
his
crowd
bought
you
and
john
thayer
out
back
there
in
after
john
died
and
all
the
money
was
put
into
your
hands
i
you
was
honest
then
i
would
wonder
if
you
meant
to
hand
over
the
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
to
your
partner
widow
but
was
harder
and
more
risky
to
send
money
east
in
them
days
than
is
now
and
so
you
waited
thinkin
maybe
that
fetch
it
to
emily
when
you
come
yourself
but
you
did
come
home
for
some
years
you
went
tradin
down
along
the
feejees
and
around
that
way
that
how
i
reasoned
it
out
these
last
few
days
on
the
train
i
give
you
credit
for
bein
honest
first
along
but
never
mind
whether
you
was
or
not
you
have
been
since
you
never
paid
over
a
cent
of
that
poor
feller
money
honest
money
that
belonged
to
his
heirs
and
belongs
to
now
you
hung
onto
it
stole
it
used
it
for
yours
and
emily
worked
and
scratched
for
a
and
died
poor
and
mary
she
died
after
bein
abused
and
deserted
by
that
cussed
husband
of
hers
and
you
thought
you
was
safe
i
and
then
turns
up
right
in
your
own
town
right
acrost
the
road
from
you
by
the
big
dipper
it
enough
to
make
a
feller
believe
that
the
almighty
does
take
a
hand
in
straightenin
out
such
things
when
us
humans
bungle
it
is
so
course
i
ai
sure
heman
what
you
meant
to
do
when
you
found
that
the
child
you
stole
that
money
from
was
goin
to
be
under
your
face
and
eyes
till
you
or
she
died
i
you
was
afraid
i
find
somethin
out
wa
you
i
presume
likely
you
thought
that
i
not
havin
quite
the
reverence
for
you
that
the
rest
of
the
bayporters
have
might
be
sharp
enough
or
lucky
enough
to
smell
a
rat
perhaps
you
suspicioned
that
i
knew
the
everdeans
anyhow
you
wanted
to
get
the
child
as
fur
out
of
your
sight
and
out
of
my
hands
as
you
could
that
so
and
when
her
dad
turned
up
you
thought
you
saw
your
chance
heman
you
answer
me
this
ai
it
part
of
your
bargain
with
thomas
that
when
he
gets
his
little
girl
he
shall
take
her
and
clear
out
away
off
somewheres
for
good
ai
it
now
what
the
monument
was
swaying
was
swinging
from
side
to
side
but
it
did
not
quite
fall
not
then
the
congressman
cheeks
hung
flabby
his
forehead
was
wet
and
he
shook
from
head
to
foot
but
he
clenched
his
jaws
and
made
one
last
attempt
at
defiance
i
i
do
know
what
you
mean
he
declared
you
you
seem
to
be
accusing
me
of
something
of
stealing
i
believe
do
you
understand
who
i
am
i
have
some
influence
and
reputation
and
it
is
dangerous
to
to
try
to
frighten
me
proofs
are
required
in
law
and
you
know
i
got
the
proofs
they
were
easy
enough
to
get
once
i
happened
on
the
track
of
lord

your
life
do
you
dare
say
to
me
again
heman
atkins
you
owe
me
as
guardian
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
with
interest
since
what
you
goin
to
do
about
it
here
was
one
ray
a
feeble
ray
of
light
you
not
her
guardian
cried
atkins
the
courts
have
thrown
you
out
and
your
appeal
wo
stand
either
if
any
money
is
due
it
belongs
to
her
father
she
is
of
age
no
sir
her
father
captain
cy
patience
had
been
giving
way
now
he
lost
it
altogether
he
strode
across
the
room
and
shook
his
forefinger
in
his
victim
face
so
he
cried
that
your
tack
is
it
by
the
big
dipper
you
go
to
her
father
just
you
go
to
him
and
tell
him
just
hint
to
him
that
you
owe
his
daughter
thousand
dollars
and
see
what
do
good
heavens
above
he
was
ready
to
sell
her
out
to
me
for
fifty
dollars
wuth
of
sand
bank
in
orham
almost
ready
he
was
till
you
offered
a
higher
price
to
him
to
fight
why
he
have
your
hide
nailed
up
on
the
barn
door
if
you
do
pay
him
every
red
copper
down
on
the
nail
he
wring
you
dry
and
then
he
blackmail
you
forever
and
ever
amen
unless
of
course
go
home
and
stop
the
blackmail
by
printing
my
story
in
the
breeze
i
a
precious
good
mind
to
do
it
by
the
almighty
i
will
do
it
unless
you
come
off
that
high
horse
of
yours
and
talk
like
a
and
then
the
monument
fell
fell
prostrate
with
a
sickly
pitiful
crash
if
we
of
bayport
could
have
seen
our
congressman
then
the
great
man
great
no
longer
broke
down
completely
he
cried
like
a
baby
it
was
all
true
all
true
he
had
not
meant
to
steal
at
first
he
had
been
led
into
using
the
money
in
his
business
then
he
had
meant
to
send
it
to
the
heirs
but
he
did
know
their
whereabouts
captain
cy
smiled
at
this
excuse
and
now
he
could
pay
he
could
he
had
hardly
that
sum
in
the
world
he
had
lost
money
in
stocks
his
property
in
the
south
had
gone
to
the
bad
he
would
be
ruined
he
would
have
to
go
to
prison
he
was
getting
to
be
an
old
man
and
there
was
alicia
his
daughter
think
of
her
think
of
the
disgrace
and
so
on
over
and
over
with
the
one
recurring
burden
what
was
the
captain
going
to
do
what
was
he
going
to
do
it
was
a
miserable
dreadful
exhibition
and
captain
cy
could
feel
no
pride
in
his
triumph
there
there
he
said
at
last
stop
it
man
stop
it
for
goodness
sakes
pull
yourself
together
i
guess
we
can
fix
it
up
somehow
i
goin
to
be
too
hard
on
you
if
it
wa
for
your
meanness
in
willin
to
let
suffer
her
life
long
with
that
drunken
beast
of
a
dad
of
hers
i
feel
almost
like
tellin
you
to
get
up
and
forget
it
but
that
got
to
be
stopped
now
you
listen
to
heman
listened
he
was
on
his
knees
beside
the
bed
his
face
buried
in
his
arms
and
his
gray
hair
the
leonine
atkins
hair
which
he
was
wont
to
toss
backward
in
the
heated
periods
of
his
eloquence
tumbled
and
draggled
captain
cy
looked
down
at
him
this
whole
business
about
must
be
stopped
he
said
and
stopped
right
off
you
tell
your
lawyers
to
drop
the
case
her
dad
is
only
hangin
around
because
you
pay
him
to
he
do
want
her
he
do
care
what
becomes
of
her
if
you
pay
him
enough
he
go
wo
he
and
not
come
back
the
congressman
raised
his
head
why
yes
he
faltered
i
think
he
will
yes
i
think
i
could
arrange
that
but
cyrus
the
captain
held
up
his
hand
i
intend
to
look
out
for
he
said
she
cares
for
me
anyone
else
in
the
world
she
as
much
to
me
as
my
own
child
ever
could
be
and
i
see
that
she
is
happy
and
provided
for
i
religious
enough
to
believe
she
was
sent
to
me
and
i
intend
to
stick
to
my
trust
as
for
the
money
yes
yes
the
money
well
i
wo
be
too
hard
on
you
that
way
either
we
talk
that
over
later
on
maybe
we
can
arrange
for
you
to
pay
it
a
little
at
a
time
you
can
sign
a
paper
showin
that
you
owe
it
and
we
fix
the
payin
to
suit
all
hands
as
if
the
child
was
in
want
i
got
some
money
of
my
own
and
what
mine
hers
i
think
we
need
worry
about
the
money
god
bless
you
cyrus
i
yes
all
right
i
sure
your
askin
for
the
blessin
be
a
great
help
now
you
do
your
part
and
i
do
mine
no
one
knows
of
this
business
but
me
i
did
tell
everdean
a
word
he
do
know
why
i
hustled
out
there
and
back
nor
why
i
asked
so
many
questions
and
he
ai
the
kind
to
pry
into
what
do
concern
him
so
you
pretty
safe
i
now
if
you
do
mind
i
wish
you
run
along
home
i
i
used
up
sort
atkins
arose
from
his
knees
even
then
broken
as
he
was
he
looked
ten
years
older
than
when
he
entered
the
room
he
could
hardly
believe
what
he
had
just
heard
you
mean
he
faltered
cyrus
do
you
mean
that
that
you
not
going
to
reveal
this
this
that
i
not
goin
to
tell
on
you
yup
that
what
i
mean
you
get
rid
of
thomas
and
squelch
that
law
case
and
i
keep
mum
you
can
trust
me
for
but
but
cyrus
the
people
at
home
your
story
in
the
breeze
not
no
they
need
know
either
it
be
between
you
and
god
bless
you
i
never
forget
that
right
you
must
forgettin
is
the
one
thing
you
must
do
and
see
here
you
boss
of
the
political
fleet
in
bayport
you
steer
the
school
committee
now
phoebe
dawes
ai
too
popular
with
that
committee
i
see
that
she
was
yes
yes
she
shall
be
she
shall
not
be
disturbed
is
there
anything
else
i
can
do
why
yes
i
guess
there
is
speakin
of
popularity
made
me
think
of
it
that
harbor
appropriation
had
better
go
a
very
faint
tinge
of
color
came
into
the
congressman
chalky
face
he
hesitated
in
his
reply
i
i
do
know
about
that
cyrus
he
said
the
bill
will
probably
be
voted
on
in
a
few
days
it
is
made
up
and
then
i
strain
a
and
make
it
over
i
work
real
hard
on
it
sorry
about
that
sugar
river
but
i
bayport
have
to
come
first
yes
it
have
to
heman
it
sartin
the
reference
to
the
sugar
river
was
the
final
straw
evidently
this
man
knew
everything
i
i
try
my
best
affirmed
heman
thank
you
cyrus
you
have
been
more
merciful
than
i
had
a
right
to
yes
i
guess
i
have
why
do
i
do
it
he
smiled
and
shook
his
head
well
i
do
know
for
two
reasons
maybe
first
i
hate
to
be
responsible
for
tippin
over
such
a
idol
as
you
been
to
make
ruins
for
angie
phinney
and
the
other
blackbirds
to
peck
at
and
caw
over
and
second
well
it
does
sound
presumin
do
it
but
i
kind
of
pity
you
say
heman
he
added
with
a
chuckle
that
a
kind
of
distinction
in
a
way
ai
it
a
good
many
folks
have
hurrahed
over
you
and
worshipped
you
some
of
i
guess
likely
have
envied
you
but
by
the
big
dipper
i
do
believe
i
the
only
one
in
this
round
world
that
ever
pitied
you
the
elevator
right
down
the
it
required
some
resolution
for
the
honorable
atkins
to
walk
down
that
corridor
and
press
the
elevator
button
but
he
did
it
somehow
a
guest
came
out
of
one
of
the
rooms
and
approached
him
as
he
stood
there
it
was
a
man
he
knew
heman
squared
his
shoulders
and
set
every
nerve
and
muscle
good
evening
atkins
said
the
man
a
miserable
night
is
it
miserable
indeed
replied
the
congressman
the
strength
in
his
voice
surprised
him
the
man
passed
on
heman
descended
in
the
elevator
walked
steadily
through
the
crowded
lobby
and
out
to
the
curb
where
his
cab
was
waiting
the
driver
noticed
nothing
strange
in
his
appearance
he
noticed
nothing
strange
when
the
atkins
residence
was
reached
and
its
tenant
mounted
the
stone
steps
and
opened
the
door
with
his
latchkey
but
if
he
had
seen
the
dignified
form
collapse
in
a
library
chair
and
moan
and
rock
back
and
forth
until
the
morning
hours
he
would
have
wondered
very
much
indeed
meanwhile
captain
cy
coughing
and
shivering
by
the
radiator
had
been
summoned
from
that
warm
haven
by
a
knock
at
his
door
a
bell
boy
stood
at
the
threshold
holding
a
brown
envelope
in
his
hand
the
clerk
sent
this
up
to
you
sir
he
said
it
came
a
week
ago
when
you
went
away
you
did
leave
any
address
and
whatever
letters
came
for
you
were
sent
back
to
bayport
massachusetts
the
clerk
says
you
registered
from
there
sir
but
he
kept
this
telegram
it
was
in
your
box
and
the
day
clerk
forgot
to
give
it
to
you
this
the
captain
tore
open
the
envelope
the
telegram
was
from
his
lawyer
peabody
it
was
dated
a
week
before
and
read
as
follows
come
home
at
once
chapter
xx
divided
honors
the
blizzard
began
that
night
bayport
has
a
generous
allowance
of
storms
and
gales
during
a
winter
although
as
a
usual
thing
there
is
more
rain
than
snow
and
more
wind
than
either
but
we
can
count
with
certainty
on
at
least
one
blizzard
between
november
and
april
and
about
the
time
when
captain
cy
feverish
and
ill
the
delayed
telegram
in
his
pocket
and
a
great
fear
in
his
heart
boarded
the
sleeper
of
the
train
at
washington
snow
was
beginning
to
fall
in
our
village
next
morning
when
georgianna
came
downstairs
to
prepare
breakfast
the
housekeeper
had
ceased
to
go
home
nights
since
the
captain
absence
the
world
outside
was
a
tumbled
driving
whirl
of
white
the
woodshed
and
barn
dimly
seen
through
the
smother
were
but
gray
shapes
emerging
now
and
then
only
to
be
wiped
from
the
vision
as
by
a
great
flapping
cloth
wielded
by
the
mighty
hand
of
the
wind
the
old
house
shook
in
the
blasts
the
windowpanes
rattled
as
if
handfuls
of
small
shot
were
being
thrown
against
them
and
the
carpet
on
the
floor
of
the
dining
room
puffed
up
in
miniature
billows
school
was
out
of
the
question
and
her
breakfast
eaten
prepared
to
put
in
a
cozy
day
with
her
dolls
and
christmas
playthings
when

asked
of
the
housekeeper
she
had
asked
the
same
thing
at
least
three
times

day
during
the
fortnight

georgianna
answer
was
always
just

unsatisfactory

unobtainable
no
trains

get
through
and
the
telephone
and
telegraph
wires
were
out
of
commission
owing
to
the
great
storm
bayport
was
buried
under
a
white
coverlet
three
feet
thick
on
a
level
which
shone
in
the
winter
sun
as
if
powdered
with
diamond
dust
the
brigade
meaning
most
of
the
active
male
citizens
was
busy
with

of

snatched
the
telegram
from
him
and
tore
it
open
it
was
not
as
bad
as
might
have
been
but
it
was
bad
enough
lawyer
peabody
wired
that
captain
cyrus
whittaker
was
at
his
home
in
ostable
sick
in
bed
and
threatened
with
pneumonia
captain
cy
hurrying
homeward
in
response
to
the
attorney
former
telegram
had
reached
boston
the
day
of
the
blizzard
he
had
taken
the
train
for
bayport
that
afternoon
the
train
had
reached
ostable
after
nine
that
night
but
could
get
no
farther
the
captain
burning
with
fever
and
torn
by
chills
had
wallowed
through
the
drifts
to
his
lawyer
home
and
collapsed
on
his
doorstep
now
he
was
very
ill
and
at
times
delirious
for
two
weeks
he
lay
fighting
off
the
threatened
attack
of
pneumonia
but
he
won
the
fight
and
at
last
word
came
to
the
anxious
ones
at
bayport
that
he
was
past
the
danger
point
and
would
pull
through
there
was
rejoicing
at
the
cy
whittaker
place
the
board
of
strategy
came
and
performed
an
impromptu
war
dance
around
the
table
shouted
bailey
bangs
tossing
above
his
head
your
uncle
cy
weathered
the
horn
and
is
bound
for
clear
water
now
three
cheers
for
our
side
wo
we
give
him
a
reception
when
we
get
him
back
here
wo
we
crowed
asaph
well
i
just
guess
we
will
you
ought
to
hear
angie
and
the
rest
of
chant
hymns
of
glory
about
him
a
body
think
they
always
knew
he
was
the
salt
of
the
earth
maybe
i
do
rub
it
in
a
little
hey
oh
no
maybe
not
and
heman
chimed
in
bangs
and
heman
would
you
ever
believe
he
change
so
all
of
a
sudden
bully
old
whit
i
can
mention
his
name
now
without
ketury
landin
onto
me
like
a
snowslide
whee
i
say
he
continued
to
say
it
and
georgianna
and
asaph
said
what
amounted
to
the
same
thing
a
change
had
come
over
our
bayport
social
atmosphere
a
marvelous
change
and
at
simmons
and
more
wonderful
still
at
tad
simpson
barber
shop
plans
were
being
made
and
perfected
for
proceedings
in
which
cyrus
whittaker
was
to
play
the
most
prominent
part
meanwhile
the
convalescence
went
on
at
a
rapid
rate
as
soon
as
he
was
permitted
to
talk
captain
cy
began
to
question
his
lawyer
how
about
the
appeal
had
atkins
done
anything
further
the
answers
were
satisfactory
the
case
had
been
dropped
the
honorable
heman
had
announced
its
withdrawal
he
had
said
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
and
should
not
continue
to
espouse
the
thomas
cause
in
fact
he
seemed
to
have
whirled
completely
about
on
his
pedestal
and
like
a
compass
now
pointed
only
in
one
direction
toward
his
boyhood
friend
and
present
neighbor
cyrus
whittaker
it
perfectly
astounding
commented
peabody
what
in
the
world
captain
did
you
do
to
him
while
you
were
in
washington
oh
nothin
much
was
the
rather
disinterested
answer
him
and
me
had
a
talk
and
he
saw
the
error
of
his
ways
i
how
did
you
give
her
my
love
when
you
so
far
as
the
case
is
concerned
went
on
the
lawyer
i
think
we
should
have
won
that
anyway
it
a
curious
thing
thomas
has
disappeared
how
he
got
word
or
who
he
got
it
from
do
know
but
he
must
have
and
he
gone
somewhere
no
one
knows
where
and
yet
not
certain
that
we
were
on
the
right
trail
it
seemed
certain
a
week
ago
but
now
the
captain
had
not
been
listening
he
was
thinking
thomas
had
gone
had
he
good
heman
was
living
up
to
his
promises
and
god
bless
her
was
free
from
that
danger
have
you
heard
from
emmie
i
asked
you
he
repeated
he
would
not
listen
to
anything
further
concerning
thomas
either
then
or
later
he
was
sick
of
the
whole
business
he
declared
and
now
that
everything
was
all
right
did
wish
to
talk
about
it
again
he
asked
nothing
about
the
appropriation
and
the
lawyer
acting
under
strict
orders
did
not
mention
it
only
once
did
captain
cy
inquire
concerning
a
person
in
his
home
town
who
was
not
a
member
of
his
household
how
is
er
how
the
teacher
he
inquired
one
morning
how
who
why
phoebe
dawes
the
smart
is
she
yes
indeed
why
she
has
been
the
most
the
doctor
came
in
just
then
and
the
interview
terminated
it
was
not
resumed
because
that
afternoon
peabody
started
for
boston
on
a
business
trip
to
be
gone
some
time
and
at
last
came
the
great
day
the
day
when
captain
cy
was
to
be
taken
home
he
was
up
and
about
had
been
out
for
several
short
walks
and
was
very
nearly
his
own
self
again
he
was
in
good
spirits
too
at
times
but
had
fits
of
seeming
depression
which
under
the
circumstances
were
unexplainable
the
doctor
thought
they
were
due
to
his
recent
illness
and
forbade
questioning
the
original
plan
had
been
for
the
captain
to
go
to
bayport
in
the
train
but
the
morning
set
for
his
departure
was
such
a
beautiful
one
that
peabody
who
had
the
day
before
returned
from
the
city
suggested
driving
over
so
the
open
carriage
drawn
by
the
peabody
span
was
brought
around
to
the
front
steps
and
the
captain
bundled
up
until
as
he
said
he
felt
like
a
wharf
rat
inside
a
cotton
bale
emerged
from
the
house
which
had
sheltered
him
for
a
weary
month
and
climbed
to
the
back
seat
the
attorney
got
in
beside
him
all
ashore
that
goin
ashore
observed
captain
cy
then
to
the
driver
who
stood
by
the
horses
heads
he
added
stand
by
to
get
ship
under
way
commodore
i
homeward
bound
and
there
a
little
messmate
of
mine
waitin
on
the
dock
already
i
would
wonder
so
do
hang
around
these
waters
no
you
can
but
peabody
smiled
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
just
a
minute
captain
he
said
we
got
another
passenger
she
came
to
the
house
last
evening
but
cole
thought
this
would
be
an
exciting
day
for
you
and
you
must
sleep
in
preparation
for
it
so
we
kept
her
in
the
background
it
was
something
of
a
job
but
hurrah
here
she
is
peabody
the
lawyer
wife
opened
the
front
door
she
was
laughing
the
next
moment
a
small
figure
shot
past
her
down
the
steps
and
into
the
carriage
like
a
bombshell
uncle
cyrus
she
screamed
joyously
uncle
cyrus
it
me
here
i
am
and
captain
cy
springing
up
and
shedding
wraps
and
robes
received
the
bombshell
with
open
arms
and
hugged
it
tight
he
shouted
by
the
big
dipper
why
you
little
you
you
that
was
a
wonderful
ride
emily
sat
in
the
captain
lap
he
positively
refused
to
let
her
sit
beside
him
on
the
seat
although
peabody
urged
it
fearing
the
child
might
tire
him
and
her
tongue
rattled
like
a
sewing
machine
she
had
a
thousand
things
to
tell
about
her
school
about
georgianna
about
her
dolls
about
lonesome
the
cat
and
how
many
mice
he
had
caught
about
the
big
snowstorm
georgianna
wanted
me
to
stay
at
home
and
wait
for
you
uncle
cy
she
said
but
i
teased
and
teased
and
finally
they
said
i
could
come
over
i
came
yesterday
on
the
train
tidditt
went
with
me
to
the
depot
peabody
let
me
peek
into
your
room
last
night
and
i
saw
you
eating
supper
you
did
know
i
was
there
did
you
you
bet
i
did
there
have
been
a
mutiny
right
then
if
i
caught
sight
of
you
you
little
sculpin
playin
it
on
your
uncle
cy
was
you
i
did
know
you
could
keep
a
secret
so
oh
yes
i
can
why
i
know
an
ever
so
much
bigger
secret
too
it
is
why
i
forgot
you
just
the
captain
laughingly
begged
her
to
divulge
the
big
secret
but
she
shook
her
small
head
and
refused
the
horses
trotted
on
at
a
lively
pace
and
the
miles
separating
ostable
and
bayport
were
subtracted
one
by
one
it
was
magnificent
winter
weather
the
snow
had
disappeared
from
the
road
except
in
widely
separated
spots
but
the
big
drifts
still
heaped
the
fields
and
shone
and
sparkled
in
the
sunshine
against
their
whiteness
the
pitch
pines
and
cedars
stood
darkly
green
and
the
skeleton
scrub
oaks
and
bushes
cast
delicate
shadows
the
bay
seen
over
the
flooded
frozen
salt
meadows
and
distant
dunes
was
in
its
winter
dress
of
the
deepest
sapphire
trimmed
with
whitecaps
and
fringed
with
stranded
ice
cakes
there
was
a
snap
and
tang
in
the
breeze
which
braced
one
like
a
tonic
the
party
in
the
carriage
was
a
gay
one
getting
tired
captain
asked
peabody
who
me
well
i
guess
not
home
there
the
salt
works
ahead
they
passed
the
abandoned
salt
works
the
crumbling
ruins
of
a
dead
industry
and
the
boundary
stone
now
half
hidden
in
a
drift
marking
the
beginning
of
bayport
township
then
from
the
pine
grove
at
the
curve
farther
on
appeared
two
capped
and
coated
figures
performing
a
crazy
fandango
who
them
two
lunatics
inquired
captain
cy
whoopin
and
on
in
the
middle
of
the
road
has
anybody
up
this
way
had
a
jug
come
by
express
or
hey
what
why
you
old
idiots
you
come
here
and
let
me
get
a
hold
of
you
the
board
of
strategy
swooped
down
upon
the
carriage
like
trumet
mosquitoes
on
a
summer
boarder
they
swarmed
into
the
vehicle
bailey
on
the
front
seat
and
asaph
in
the
rear
where
somehow
or
other
they
made
room
for
him
there
were
handshakings
and
thumps
on
the
back
what

the
west
end
of
nowhere

captain

the
big
dipper

repeated
bailey
and
angie
what

ugh
the
last
exclamation
was
the
result
of
a
tremendous
dig
in
the
ribs
from
the
tidditt
fist
asaph
who
had
leaned
forward
to
administer
it
was
frowning
and
shaking
his
head
bangs
relapsed
into
a
grinning
silence
west
bayport
seemed
to
be
deserted
at
one
or
two
houses
however
feminine
heads
appeared
at
the
windows
one
old
lady
shook
a
calico
apron
at
the
carriage
a
child
beside
her
cried
hurrah
aunt
hepsy
colors
by
mistake
laughed
the
captain
she
ai
got
her
specs
i
guess
and
thinks
i
heman
that
comes
of
astern
of
a
span
but
as
they
drew
near
the
center
flags
were
flying
from
poles
some
of
the
houses
were
decorated
what
in
the
world
began
captain
cy
land
sakes
look
at
the
schoolhouse
and
simmons
and
and
simpson
the
schoolhouse
flag
was
flapping
in
the
wind
the
scarred
wooden
pillars
of
its
portico
were
hidden
with
bunting
simmons
front
displayed
a
row
of
little
banners
each
bearing
a
letter
the
letters
spelled
welcome
tad
barber
shop
was
more
or
less
artistically
wreathed
in
colored
tissue
paper
there
too
a
flag
was
draped
over
the
front
door
yet
not
a
single
person
was
in
sight
for
goodness
sake
cried
the
bewildered
captain
what
all
this
mean
and
where
is
everybody
have
all
hands
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence
they
were
at
the
foot
of
whittaker
hill
its
top
between
the
atkins
gate
and
the
whittaker
fence
was
black
with
people
children
pranced
about
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
a
shout
came
down
the
wind
the
horses
not
in
the
least
fatigued
by
their
long
canter
trotted
up
the
slope
the
shouting
grew
louder
a
wave
of
youngsters
came
racing
to
meet
the
equipage
what
what
in
time
gasped
captain
cy
what
up
i
and
then
the
town
clerk
seized
him
by
the
arm
peabody
shook
his
other
hand
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
bailey
stood
up
and
waved
his
hat

whittaker
bellowed
a
person
in
the
crowd
this
person
wonder
of
wonders
was
tad
simpson
the
cheering
was
considering
the
size
of
the
crowd
tremendous
bewildered
and
amazed
captain
cy
was
assisted
from
the
carriage
and
escorted
to
his
front
door
amidst
the
applauding
people
he
saw
keturah
bangs
and
alpheus
smalley
and
angeline
phinney
and
captain
salters
even
alonzo
snow
his
recent
opponent
in
town
meeting
josiah
dimick
was
there
too
apparently
having
a
fit
on
the
doorstep
stood
georgianna
and
and
yes
it
was
true
beside
her
grandly
extending
a
welcoming
hand
the
majestic
form
of
the
honorable
heman
atkins
some
one
else
was
there
also
some
one
who
hurriedly
slipped
back
into
the
crowd
as
the
owner
of
the
cy
whittaker
place
came
up
the
path
between
the
hedges
atkins
shook
the
captain
hand
and
then
turning
toward
the
people
held
up
his
own
for
silence
to
all
outward
appearance
he
was
still
the
great
heman
our
district
idol
philanthropist
and
leader
his
silk
hat
glistened
as
of
old
his
chest
swelled
in
the
old
manner
his
whiskers
were
just
as
dignified
and
for
an
instant
as
he
met
the
captain
eye
his
own
faltered
and
fell
and
there
was
a
pleading
expression
in
his
face
the
lines
of
which
had
deepened
just
a
little
but
only
for
an
instant
then
he
began
to
speak
cyrus
he
said
it
is
my
pleasant
duty
on
behalf
of
your
neighbors
and
friends
here
assembled
to
welcome
you
to
your
er
ancestral
home
after
your
trying
illness
i
do
it
heartily
sincerely
gladly
and
it
is
the
more
pleasing
to
me
to
perform
this
duty
because
as
i
have
explained
publicly
to
my
all
disagreement
between
us
is
ended
i
was
wrong
again
i
publicly
admit
it
a
scheming
blackleg
posing
in
the
guise
of
a
loving
father
imposed
upon
me
i
am
sorry
for
the
trouble
i
have
caused
you
of
you
and
of
the
little
girl
with
you
i
ask
pardon
i
entreat
he
paused
captain
cy
the
shadow
of
a
smile
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
nodded
and
said
briefly
all
right
heman
i
forgive
few
heard
him
the
majority
were
applauding
the
congressman
sylvanus
cahoon
whispering
in
the
ear
of
uncle
bedny
expressed
as
his
opinion
that
that
was
about
as
magnaminious
a
thing
as
ever
i
heard
said
yes
sir
that
what
call
but
continued
the
great
atkins
i
have
said
all
this
to
you
before
what
i
have
to
say
now
what
i
left
my
duties
in
washington
expressly
to
come
here
and
say
is
that
bayport
thanks
you
thank
you
for
your
tremendous
assistance
in
obtaining
the
appropriation
which
is
to
make
our
harbor
a
busy
port
where
our
gallant
fishing
fleet
may
ride
at
anchor
and
unload
its
catch
instead
of
transferring
it
in
dories
as
heretofore
friends
i
have
already
told
you
how
this
man
laying
a
hand
on
the
captain
shoulder
came
to
the
capital
and
used
his
influence
among
his
acquaintances
in
high
places
with
the
result
that
the
thirty
thousand
dollars
which
i
had
despaired
of
getting
was
added
to
the
bill
i
had
the
pleasure
of
voting
for
that
bill
it
passed
i
am
proud
of
that
tremendous
applause
then
some
one
called
for
three
cheers
for
atkins
they
were
given
but
the
recipient
merely
bowed
no
no
he
said
deprecatingly
no
no
not
for
me
my
friends
much
as
i
appreciate
your
gratitude
my
days
of
public
service
are
nearly
at
an
end
as
i
have
intimated
to
some
of
you
already
i
am
seriously
considering
retiring
from
political
life
in
the
near
future
but
that
is
irrelevant
it
is
not
material
at
present
we
meet
not
to
say
farewell
to
the
setting
but
to
greet
the
rising
sun
call
for
three
cheers
for
our
committee
of
one
captain
cyrus
when
the
uproar
had
at
last
subsided
there
were
demands
for
a
speech
from
captain
cy
but
the
captain
facing
them
his
arms
about
the
delighted
positively
declined
to
orate
i
i
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
folks
he
stammered
i
am
so
but
you
have
to
excuse
me
from
speechmaking
they
they
did
teach
it
afore
the
mast
where
i
went
to
college
thank
you
just
the
same
and
do
come
and
see
me
everybody
me
and
this
little
girl
drawing
emily
nearer
to
him
will
be
real
glad
to
have
after
the
handshaking
and
congratulating
were
over
the
crowd
dispersed
it
was
a
great
occasion
all
agreed
to
that
but
the
majority
considered
it
a
divided
triumph
the
captain
had
done
a
lot
for
the
town
of
course
but
the
honorable
atkins
had
made
another
splendid
impression
by
his
address
of
welcome
most
people
thought
it
as
fine
as
his
memorable
effort
at
town
meeting
unlike
that
one
however
in
this
instance
it
is
safe
to
say
that
none
not
even
the
adoring
and
miss
phinney
derived
quite
the
enjoyment
from
the
congressman
speech
that
captain
cy
did
it
tickled
his
sense
of
humor
ase
he
observed
irrelevantly
when
the
five
tidditt
georgianna
bailey
and
himself
were
at
last
alone
again
in
the
sitting
room
it
do
pay
to
tip
over
a
monument
does
it
not
out
in
public
i
mean
you
would
want
to
see
me
blow
up
bunker
hill
would
you
blow
up
bunker
hill
repeated
asaph
in
alarmed
amazement
godfrey
scissors
i
believe
you
goin
loony
this
day
been
too
much
for
you
what
are
you
talkin
about
oh
nothin
with
a
quiet
chuckle
i
was
thinkin
out
loud
all
did
you
ever
notice
them
imitation
stone
pillars
on
heman
house
they
holler
inside
but
you
never
guess
it
and
long
as
you
do
know
they
holler
you
can
keep
a
watch
on
and
there
one
thing
sure
he
added
they
are
chapter
xxi
captain
cy
picture
wonder
where
phoebe
went
to
remarked
tidditt
a
little
later
i
thought
i
saw
her
with
heman
and
georgianna
on
the
front
steps
when
we
drove
she
was
there
affirmed
the
housekeeper
she
been
helpin
me
trim
up
the
rooms
here
what
do
you
think
of
cyrus
ai
they
pretty
the
sitting
room
and
dining
room
were
gay
with
evergreens
and
flowers
our
living
room
windows
in
the
winter
time
are
usually
filled
with
carefully
tended
potted
plants
and
the
neighbors
had
loaned
their
geraniums
and
fuchsias
and
heliotrope
and
begonias
to
brighten
the
whittaker
house
for
its
owner
return
captain
cy
who
was
sitting
in
the
rocker
with
on
his
knee
looked
about
him
now
that
the
first
burst
of
excitement
was
over
he
seemed
grave
and
preoccupied
they
look
mighty
pretty
georgianna
he
said
fine
enough
but
what
was
that
you
just
said
did
yup
interrupted
miss
taylor
who
had
scarcely
ceased
talking
since
breakfast
that
morning
yes
was
teacher
that
helped
fix
not
that
i
would
have
got
along
without
her
but
i
had
more
to
do
than
a
little
cleanin
and
scrubbin
up
so
phoebe
she
come
in
and
oh
yes
as
i
was
sayin
she
was
out
front
with
me
but
the
minute
your
carriage
drove
up
with
that
lovely
span
ai
that
a
fine
span
i
they
what
become
of
teacher
broke
in
bailey
why
she
run
off
somewheres
i
did
see
where
she
went
to
i
was
too
busy
hollerin
at
whittaker
and
noticin
that
span
i
bet
you
they
made
angie
phinney
eyes
stick
out
i
guess
she
realizes
that
we
in
this
house
are
some
punkins
now
if
i
do
lord
it
over
her
when
i
run
acrost
her
these
days
then
i
miss
my
guess
i
belay
ordered
captain
cy
his
gravity
more
pronounced
than
ever
how
does
it
happen
that
you
see
here
georgianna
did
you
tell
ph
er
miss
dawes
what
i
told
you
to
tell
her
when
i
went
away
why
yes
i
told
her
i
hated
to
dreadful
but
i
done
it
she
was
awful
set
back
at
fust
but
i
guess
she
asked
tidditt
where
you
goin
tidditt
the
town
clerk
his
face
red
was
on
his
way
to
the
door
asked
ase
repeated
the
captain
ase
come
here
did
you
tell
her
anything
asaph
was
very
much
embarrassed
well
he
stammered
i
did
mean
to
cy
but
she
got
to
askin
me
questions
and
somehow
or
nother
i
did
tell
her
about
our
confab
yours
and
mine
i
told
her
that
i
knew
folks
was
talkin
and
i
felt
was
my
duty
to
tell
you
so
that
why
i
done
it
and
i
told
her
you
said
well
you
know
what
you
said
yourself
captain
cy
was
evidently
much
disturbed
he
put
down
and
rose
to
his
feet
well
he
asked
sharply
what
did
she
say
oh
she
was
white
and
still
for
a
minute
or
two
then
she
kind
of
stamped
her
foot
and
went
off
and
left
me
but
next
time
she
met
me
she
was
nice
as
pie
she
been
pretty
frosty
to
angie
and
the
rest
of
but
she
been
always
nice
to
bailey
and
me
why
when
i
asked
her
pardon
she
said
not
at
all
she
was
very
glad
to
know
the
truth
it
helped
her
to
understand
things
and
you
could
see
she
meant
it
too
she
so
she
has
been
comin
here
ever
since
and
the
gossip
has
been
on
i
well
by
the
big
dipper
it
stop
now
i
see
to
the
board
of
strategy
and
the
housekeeper
were
amazed
gossip
repeated
bailey
well
i
guess
there
ai
nothin
said
against
her
now
not
in
this
town
there
ai
why
all
hands
praise
her
enough
for
her
smartness
in
findin
out
about
that
thomas
if
it
wa
for
her
he
be
botherin
you
yet
cy
you
know
it
what
are
you
talkin
about
captain
cy
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
he
said
slowly
you
run
and
help
georgianna
in
the
kitchen
a
spell
she
got
her
dinner
to
look
out
for
i
guess
likely
georgianna
to
the
housekeeper
who
looked
anything
but
eager
you
better
see
to
your
dinner
right
off
and
take
emmie
with
miss
taylor
reluctantly
departed
leading
by
the
hand
the
child
was
loath
to
leave
her
uncle
but
he
told
her
he
would
give
a
cent
for
his
first
dinner
at
home
if
she
did
help
in
preparing
it
so
she
went
out
happy
now
then
demanded
the
captain
what
this
about
phoebe
and
thomas
i
want
to
know
stop
do
ask
another
question
answer
me
so
the
board
of
strategy
by
turns
and
in
concert
told
of
the
drive
to
trumet
and
the
call
on
debby
beasley
asaph
would
have
narrated
the
story
of
the
upset
sulky
but
bailey
shut
him
up
in
short
order
never
mind
that
foolishness
he
snapped
you
see
cy
debby
had
just
been
out
to
arizona
visitin
old
beasley
niece
and
she
fell
in
with
a
woman
out
there
whose
husband
had
run
off
and
left
her
and
debby
she
read
the
advertisement
about
him
in
the
arizona
paper
and
it
said
he
had
the
spring
halt
in
his
off
hind
leg
or
somethin
similar
now
thomas
he
had
that
too
and
there
was
other
things
that
reminded
phoebe
of
him
so
she
do
say
nothin
to
nobody
but
she
writes
to
this
woman
askin
for
more
and
a
photograph
of
the
one
the
come
but
the
photograph
did
the
wife
have
none
i
but
there
was
enough
to
send
phoebe
hotfoot
to
peabody
and
peabody
he
writes
to
his
lawyer
friend
in
butte
montana
and
the
butte
man
he
well
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
cut
in
tidditt
that
it
looked
safe
and
sartin
that
thomas
had
married
the
arizona
woman
while
his
real
wife
ma
was
livin
and
had
run
off
and
left
her
same
as
he
did
mary
and
the
funny
part
of
it
is
the
funny
part
of
it
is
declared
bangs
drowning
his
friend
voice
by
raising
his
own
that
somebody
out
there
some
scalawag
friend
of
this
thomas
must
have
got
wind
of
what
was
up
and
sent
word
to
him
when
they
went
to
hunt
for
him
in
boston
he
gone
skipped
cut
stick
and
they
ai
seen
him
since
he
was
afraid
of
bein
took
up
for
bigamist
you
see
for
bein
a
bigamy
i
mean
well
you
know
what
i
tryin
to
say
anyhow
if
it
had
been
for
me
and
phoebe
you
and
phoebe
snorted
asaph
you
had
a
whole
lot
to
do
with
it
did
you
you
and
aunt
debby
do
to
go
together
i
understand
cruisin
round
makin
proclamations
that
she
was
responsible
for
the
whole
thing
no
it
phoebe
dawes
that
the
credit
belongs
to
and
this
town
ai
done
nothin
but
praise
her
since
it
come
out
you
never
see
such
a
quick
in
your
life
unless
was
heman
but
you
knew
all
this
afore
whit
peabody
must
have
told
captain
cy
had
listened
to
his
friends
story
with
a
face
expressive
of
the
most
blank
astonishment
as
he
learned
of
the
trip
to
trumet
and
its
results
his
eyes
and
mouth
opened
and
he
repeatedly
rubbed
his
forehead
and
muttered
exclamations
now
at
the
mention
of
his
name
he
seemed
to
awaken
hold
on
he
interrupted
waving
his
hand
hold
on
by
the
big
dipper
this
is
is
where
is
peabody
i
want
to
see
here
i
am
captain
said
the
attorney
he
had
been
out
to
the
barn
to
superintend
the
stabling
of
the
span
but
for
the
past
five
minutes
had
been
standing
unnoticed
by
his
client
on
the
threshold
of
the
dining
room
see
here
demanded
captain
cy
see
here
peabody
is
this
yarn
true
is
it
now
this
about
about
phoebe
and
all
certainly
it
true
i
supposed
you
knew
it
you
did
seem
surprised
when
i
told
you
the
case
was
surprised
why
no
i
thought
heman
had
never
mind
that
land
of
love
she
did
it
she
he
sat
weakly
down
the
lawyer
looked
anxious
mr
tidditt
he
whispered
i
think
perhaps
he
had
better
be
left
alone
for
the
present
he
just
up
from
a
sick
bed
and
this
has
been
a
trying
forenoon
come
in
again
this
afternoon
i
shall
try
to
persuade
him
to
take
a
the
board
of
strategy
its
curiosity
unsatisfied
departed
reluctantly
when
peabody
returned
to
the
sitting
room
he
found
that
naps
were
far
indeed
from
the
captain
thoughts
the
latter
was
pacing
the
floor
where
is
she
he
demanded
she
was
standin
on
the
steps
with
heman
have
you
seen
her
since
his
friend
was
troubled
why
yes
i
seen
her
he
said
i
have
been
talking
with
her
she
has
gone
gone
away
where
what
do
you
mean
she
ai
ai
left
bayport
no
no
what
in
the
world
should
she
leave
bayport
for
she
has
gone
to
her
boarding
house
i
guess
at
all
events
she
was
headed
in
that
why
did
she
shake
hands
with
me
what
made
her
go
off
and
not
say
a
word
oh
well
i
guess
likely
i
know
the
why
he
sighed
despondently
i
told
her
never
to
come
here
you
did
what
in
the
world
well
for
what
i
thought
was
good
reasons
all
on
her
account
they
was
and
yet
she
did
come
back
and
kept
comin
even
after
ase
blabbed
the
whole
thing
however
i
that
was
just
to
help
georgianna
oh
hum
i
am
an
old
the
lawyer
inspected
him
seriously
well
captain
he
said
slowly
if
it
is
any
comfort
for
you
to
know
that
your
reason
is
the
correct
one
for
miss
dawes
going
away
i
can
assure
you
on
that
point
i
think
she
went
because
she
was
greatly
disappointed
and
did
wish
to
see
you
just
disappointed
what
do
you
mean
humph
i
did
mean
to
tell
you
yet
but
i
judge
that
i
better
no
one
knows
it
here
but
miss
dawes
and
i
and
probably
no
one
but
us
three
need
ever
know
it
you
see
the
fact
is
that
the
arizona
woman
desire
higgins
is
thomas
at
all
he
is
her
missing
what
yes
it
so
really
it
was
too
much
of
a
coincidence
to
be
possible
and
yet
it
certainly
did
seem
that
it
would
prove
true
this
higgins
woman
was
apparently
so
anxious
to
find
her
missing
man
that
she
was
ready
to
recognize
almost
any
description
and
the
slight
lameness
and
the
fact
of
his
having
been
in
montana
helped
along
if
we
could
have
gotten
a
photograph
sooner
the
question
would
have
been
settled
only
last
week
while
i
was
in
boston
i
got
word
from
the
detective
agency
that
a
photo
had
been
received
i
went
to
see
it
immediately
there
was
some
resemblance
but
not
enough
henry
thomas
was
never
but
but
they
say
thomas
has
skipped
yes
he
has
that
the
queer
part
of
it
at
the
place
where
he
boarded
we
learned
that
he
got
a
letter
from
arizona
trust
the
average
landlady
to
look
at
postmarks
that
he
seemed
greatly
agitated
all
that
day
and
left
that
night
no
one
has
seen
him
since
why
he
went
is
a
puzzle
where
we
do
care
so
long
as
he
keeps
out
of
our
way
captain
cy
did
not
care
either
he
surmised
that
atkins
might
probably
explain
the
disappearance
and
yet
oddly
enough
this
explanation
was
not
the
true
one
the
honorable
heman
solemnly
assured
the
captain
that
he
had
not
communicated
with
emily
father
he
intended
to
do
so
as
a
part
of
the
compact
agreed
upon
at
the
hotel
but
the
man
had
fled
and
the
mystery
is
still
unsolved
the
supposition
is
that
there
really
was
a
wife
somewhere
in
the
west
who
or
where
she
was
no
bayporter
knows
henry
thomas
has
never
come
back
to
explain
i
told
miss
dawes
of
the
photograph
and
what
it
proved
went
on
peabody
she
was
dreadfully
disappointed
she
could
hardly
speak
when
she
left
me
i
urged
her
to
come
in
and
see
you
but
she
would
evidently
she
had
set
her
heart
on
helping
you
and
the
child
it
is
too
bad
because
practically
speaking
we
owe
everything
to
her
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
inquiry
set
on
foot
by
her
scared
the
thomas
fellow
into
flight
and
she
has
worked
night
and
day
to
aid
us
she
is
a
very
clever
woman
captain
whittaker
and
a
good
one
you
ca
thank
her
enough
here
what
are
you
about
captain
cy
strode
past
him
into
the
dining
room
the
hat
rack
hung
on
the
wall
by
the
side
door
he
snatched
his
cap
from
the
peg
and
was
struggling
into
his
overcoat
where
are
you
going
demanded
the
lawyer
you
must
attempt
to
walk
now
you
need
rest
i
rest
by
and
by
just
now
i
got
business
to
attend
to
let
go
of
that
but
no
buts
about
it
i
see
you
later
so
he
threw
open
the
door
and
hurried
down
the
walk
the
lawyer
watched
him
in
amazement
then
a
slow
smile
overspread
his
face
captain
he
called
captain
captain
cy
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
what
do
you
want
he
asked
peabody
face
was
now
intensely
solemn
but
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
i
think
she
at
the
boarding
house
he
said
demurely
i
pretty
certain
you
find
her
all
the
regulars
at
the
perfect
boarding
house
had
of
course
attended
the
reception
at
the
cy
whittaker
place
none
of
them
with
the
exception
of
the
schoolmistress
had
as
yet
returned
dinner
had
been
forgotten
in
the
excitement
of
the
great
day
and
keturah
and
angeline
and
tripp
had
stopped
in
at
various
dwellings
along
the
main
road
to
compare
notes
on
the
captain
appearance
and
the
atkins
address
asaph
and
bailey
and
alpheus
smalley
were
at
simmons
captain
cy
knew
better
than
to
attempt
his
hurried
trip
by
way
of
the
road
he
had
no
desire
to
be
held
up
and
congratulated
he
went
across
lots
in
the
rear
of
barns
and
orchards
wading
through
drifts
and
climbing
fences
as
no
sane
convalescent
should
but
the
captain
at
that
moment
was
suffering
from
the
form
of
insanity
known
as
the
fixed
idea
she
had
done
all
this
for
him
for
him
and
his
last
message
to
her
had
been
an
insult
he
approached
the
bangs
property
by
the
stable
lane
no
one
locks
doors
in
our
village
and
those
of
the
perfect
boarding
house
were
unfastened
he
entered
by
way
of
the
side
porch
just
as
he
had
done
when
gabe
lumley
depot
wagon
first
deposited
him
in
that
yard
but
now
he
entered
on
tiptoe
the
dining
room
was
empty
he
peeped
into
the
sitting
room
there
by
the
center
table
sat
phoebe
dawes
her
elbow
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
her
head
resting
on
her
hand
ahem
phoebe
said
captain
cy
she
started
turned
and
saw
him
standing
there
her
eyes
were
wet
and
there
was
a
handkerchief
in
her
lap
phoebe
said
the
captain
anxiously
have
you
been
cryin
she
rose
on
the
instant
a
great
wave
of
red
swept
over
her
face
the
handkerchief
fell
to
the
floor
and
she
stooped
and
picked
it
up
crying
she
repeated
confusedly
why
no
of
course
of
course
not
i
how
do
you
do
captain
whittaker
i
we
all
very
glad
to
see
you
home
again
and
she
extended
her
hand
captain
cy
reached
forward
to
take
it
then
he
hesitated
i
do
think
i
ought
to
let
you
shake
hands
with
me
phoebe
he
said
not
until
i
beg
your
beg
my
pardon
why
he
absently
took
the
hand
and
held
it
for
the
word
i
sent
to
you
when
i
went
away
was
an
awful
thing
to
say
but
i
meant
it
for
your
sake
you
know
honest
i
she
laughed
nervously
oh
that
she
said
well
i
did
think
you
were
rather
particular
as
to
your
visitors
but
tidditt
explained
and
then
you
need
beg
my
pardon
i
appreciate
your
thoughtfulness
i
knew
you
meant
to
be
kind
to
that
what
i
did
but
you
did
obey
orders
you
kept
comin
now
why
why
did
you
suppose
that
cared
for
the
malicious
gossip
of
such
people
i
came
because
you
were
in
trouble
and
i
hoped
to
help
you
and
and
i
thought
i
had
helped
until
a
few
minutes
her
lip
quivered
that
quiver
went
to
the
captain
heart
helped
he
faltered
helped
why
you
done
so
much
that
i
ever
thank
you
you
been
the
only
real
helper
i
had
in
all
this
miserable
business
you
stood
by
me
all
but
it
was
all
wrong
he
is
the
man
at
all
did
peabody
tell
you
yes
yes
he
told
me
what
difference
does
that
make
peabody
be
hanged
he
ai
in
this
it
you
and
me
do
you
see
what
made
you
do
all
this
for
me
she
looked
at
the
floor
and
not
at
him
as
she
answered
why
because
i
wanted
to
help
you
she
said
i
been
alone
in
the
world
ever
since
mother
died
years
ago
i
had
few
real
friends
your
friendship
had
come
to
mean
a
great
deal
to
me
the
splendid
fight
you
were
making
for
that
little
girl
proved
what
a
man
you
were
and
you
fought
so
bravely
when
almost
everyone
was
against
you
i
could
help
wanting
to
do
something
for
you
how
could
i
and
now
it
has
come
to
nothing
my
part
of
it
i
so
it
ai
neither
it
come
to
everything
phoebe
i
did
mean
to
say
very
much
more
than
to
beg
your
pardon
when
i
headed
for
here
but
i
got
to
i
simply
got
to
this
ca
go
on
i
ca
have
you
keep
comin
to
see
me
and
i
ca
keep
meetin
you
every
day
i
she
looked
up
as
if
to
speak
but
something
possibly
the
expression
in
his
face
caused
her
to
look
quickly
down
again
she
did
not
answer
i
ca
do
it
continued
the
captain
desperately
for
what
folks
might
say
they
would
say
much
when
i
was
around
i
tell
you
it
ai
that
it
because
i
ca
bear
to
have
you
just
a
friend
either
you
must
be
that
or
or
i
have
to
go
somewheres
else
i
realized
that
when
i
was
in
and
cruisin
to
california
and
back
i
either
got
to
take
and
go
away
for
good
or
or
she
would
not
help
him
she
would
not
speak
you
see
he
groaned

phoebe

old
fool

you
to

me
me
and
rough
from
knockin
round
the
world
and
you
young
and
educated
and
a
lady

ai

enough
to

a
thing
as
that
and
yet
i
could
stay
here
and
meet
you
every
day
and
by
and
by
see
you

somebody
else
by
the
big
dipper
i
could
do
it
so
that
why
i
ca

hands
with
you
nor
any
more
except
when
i
say
for
then
she
looked
up
the
color
was
still
bright
in
her
face
and
her
eyes
were
moist
but
she
was
smiling
ca
shake
hands
with
me
she
said
please

have
you
been
doing
for
the
last
five
minutes
captain
cy
dropped
her
hand
as
if
his
own
had
been
struck
with
paralysis
good
land
he
stammered
i
did
know
i
did
it
honest

phoebe

still
there
faint
but
very
sweet
why

i
stop

because

i
i

she
took
his
hand
and
clasped
it
with
both
her
own
i
not

said
bravely
her
eyes
brightening
as
the
wonder
and
incredulous
joy
grew
in
his
i
very
proud
and
very
very
there
was
to
be
a
big
supper
at
the
cy
whittaker
place
that
night
it
was
an
impromptu
affair
arranged
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
by
captain
cy
who
in
spite
of
the
lawyer
protests
and
anxiety
concerning
his
health
went
serenely
up
and
down
the
main
road
inviting
everybody
he
met
or
could
think
of
the
captain
face
was
as
radiant
as
a
spring
sunrise
his
smile
as
asaph
said
pretty
nigh
cut
the
upper
half
of
his
head
people
who
had
other
engagements
and
would
under
ordinary
circumstances

refused

invitation

say
no
to
his
hearty
ca

to
be
ready
at
six
georgianna
assisted
by
keturah
bangs
sylvanus
cahoon
and
other
volunteers
was
gloriously
busy
in
the
kitchen
the
table
in
the
dining
room
reached
from
one
end
of
the
big
apartment
to
the
other
guests
would
begin
to
arrive
shortly
wily
peabody
guessing
that
captain
cy
might
prefer
to
be
alone
had
taken
the
board
of
strategy
out
riding
behind
the
span
in
the
sitting
room
around
the
baseburner
stove
were
three
persons
captain
cy
and
phoebe
miss
dawes
had
come
early
at
the
captain
urgent
appeal
now
she
was
sitting
in
the
rocker
at
one
side
of
the
stove
gazing
dreamily
at
the
ruddy
light
behind
the
isinglass
panes
she
looked
quietly
blissfully
contented
and
happy
at
her
feet
on
the
braided
mat
sat
playing
with
lonesome
who
purred
lazily
the
little
girl
was
happy
too
for
was
not
her
beloved
uncle
cyrus
at
home
again
with
all
danger
of
their
separation
ended
forevermore
as
for
captain
cy
himself
the
radiant
expression
was
still
on
his
face
brighter
than
ever
he
looked
across
at
phoebe
who
smiled
back
at
him
then
he
glanced
down
at
and
all
at
once
he
realized
that
this
was
the
fulfillment
of
his
dream
here
was
his
picture
the
sitting
room
was
now
as
he
had
always
loved
to
think
of
it
as
it
used
to
be
he
was
in
his
father
chair
phoebe
in
the
one
his
mother
used
to
occupy
and
between
them
just
where
he
had
sat
so
often
when
a
boy
the
child
the
cy
whittaker
place
had
again
and
at
last
come
into
its
own
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
looked
about
the
room
at
the
stove
the
lamp
the
old
familiar
furniture
at
his
grandfather
portrait
over
the
mantel
then
in
a
flash
of
memory
his
father
words
came
back
to
him
and
he
said
laughing
aloud
from
pure
happiness
run
down
cellar
and
get
me
a
pitcher
of
cider
you
there
a
good
feller
