a
note
about
this
book
last
year
in
january
my
first
novel
http
came
out
i
was
years
old
and
i
been
calling
myself
a
novelist
since
the
age
of
it
was
the
storied
i
was
and
am
proud
as
hell
of
that
book
even
though
it
is
just
one
book
among
many
released
last
year
better
than
some
poorer
than
others
and
even
though
the
which
sold
out
very
quickly
though
generous
by
science
fiction
standards
hardly
qualifies
it
as
a
work
of
mass
entertainment
the
thing
that
extraordinary
about
that
first
novel
is
that
it
was
released
under
terms
governed
by
a
creative
commons
http
license
that
allowed
my
readers
to
copy
the
book
freely
and
distribute
it
far
and
wide
hundreds
of
thousands
of
copies
of
the
book
were
made
and
distributed
this
way
of
today
i
release
my
second
novel
and
my
third
http
a
collaboration
with
charlie
stross
is
due
any
day
and
two
http
more
http
are
under
contract
my
career
as
a
novelist
is
now
well
underway
in
other
words
i
am
firmly
afoot
on
a
long
road
that
stretches
into
the
future
my
future
science
fiction
future
publishing
future
and
the
future
of
the
world
the
future
is
my
business
more
or
less
i
a
science
fiction
writer
one
way
to
know
the
future
is
to
look
good
and
hard
at
the
present
here
a
thing
noticed
about
the
present
more
people
are
reading
more
words
off
of
more
screens
than
ever
before
here
another
thing
i
noticed
about
the
present
fewer
people
are
reading
fewer
words
off
of
fewer
pages
than
ever
before
that
does
mean
that
the
book
is
no
more
than
the
advent
of
the
printing
press
and
the
of
monks
meant
that
the
book
was
dying
but
it
does
mean
that
the
book
is
changing
i
think
that
is
alive
and
well
we
reading
our
brains
out
i
just
think
that
the
complex
social
practice
of
book
of
which
a
bunch
of
paper
pages
between
two
covers
is
the
mere
expression
is
transforming
and
will
transform
further
i
intend
on
figuring
out
what
it
transforming
into
i
intend
on
figuring
out
the
way
that
some
writers
that
right
here
wearing
my
underwear
is
going
to
get
rich
and
famous
from
his
craft
i
intend
on
figuring
out
how
words
can
become
part
of
the
social
discourse
can
be
relevant
in
the
way
that
literature
at
its
best
can
be
i
do
know
what
the
future
of
book
looks
like
to
figure
it
out
i
doing
some
pretty
basic
science
i
peering
into
this
opaque
inscrutable
system
of
publishing
as
it
sits
in
the
year
and
i
making
a
perturbation
stirring
the
pot
to
see
what
surfaces
so
that
i
can
see
if
the
system
reveals
itself
to
me
any
more
thoroughly
as
it
roils
once
that
happens
maybe
i
be
able
to
formulate
an
hypothesis
and
try
an
experiment
or
two
and
maybe
just
maybe
i
get
to
the
bottom
of
and
beat
the
competition
to
making
it
work
and
maybe
i
go
home
with
all
or
most
of
the
marbles
it
a
long
shot
but
i
a
pretty
sharp
guy
and
i
know
as
much
about
this
stuff
as
anyone
out
there
more
to
the
point
trying
stuff
and
doing
research
yields
a
chance
of
success
the
alternatives
sitting
pat
or
worse
getting
into
a
moral
panic
about
piracy
and
accusing
the
readers
who
are
blazing
new
trail
of
the
moral
equivalent
of
shoplifting
have
a
percent
chance
of
success
most
artists
never
succeed
in
the
sense
of
attaining
fame
and
modest
fortune
a
career
in
the
arts
is
a
risky
kind
of
business
i
doing
what
i
can
to
sweeten
my
odds
so
here
we
are
and
here
is
novel
number
two
a
book
called
eastern
standard
tribe
which
you
can
walk
into
shops
all
over
the
world
and
buy
http
as
a
physical
artifact
a
very
nice
physical
artifact
designed
by
art
director
irene
gallo
and
her
designer
shelley
eshkar
published
by
tor
books
a
huge
arm
of
an
enormous
multinational
publishing
concern
tor
is
watching
what
happens
to
this
book
nearly
as
keenly
as
i
am
because
we
all
very
interested
in
what
the
book
is
turning
into
to
that
end
here
is
the
book
as
a
artifact
a
file
a
bunch
of
text
slithery
bits
that
can
cross
the
world
in
an
instant
using
the
internet
a
tool
designed
to
copy
things
very
quickly
from
one
place
to
another
and
using
personal
computers
tools
designed
to
slice
dice
and
rearrange
collections
of
bits
these
tools
demand
that
their
users
copy
and
slice
and
dice
rip
mix
and
burn
and
that
what
i
hoping
you
will
do
with
this
not
just
because
i
a
swell
guy
a
slob
not
because
tor
is
run
by
addlepated
refugees
who
have
been
sold
some
about
the
revolution
because
you
the
readers
the
slicers
dicers
and
copiers
hold
in
your
collective
action
the
secret
of
the
future
of
publishing
writers
are
a
dime
a
dozen
everybody
got
a
novel
in
her
or
him
readers
are
a
precious
commodity
you
got
all
the
money
and
all
the
attention
and
you
run
the
network
that
marks
the
difference
between
a
little
book
soon
forgotten
and
a
book
that
becomes
a
lasting
piece
of
posterity
for
its
author
changing
the
world
in
some
meaningful
way
i
unashamedly
exploiting
your
imagination
imagine
me
a
new
practice
of
book
readers
take
this
novel
and
pass
it
from
inbox
to
inbox
through
your
im
clients
over
networks
put
it
on
webservers
convert
it
to
weird
obscure
ebook
formats
show
me
and
my
colleagues
and
my
publisher
what
the
future
of
book
looks
like
i
keep
on
writing
them
if
you
keep
on
reading
them
but
as
cool
and
wonderful
as
writing
is
it
not
half
so
cool
as
inventing
the
future

licensor
and
you
dedication
for
my
parents
for
my
family
for
everyone
who
helped
me
up
and
for
everyone
i
let
down
you
know
who
you
are
sincerest
thanks
and
most
heartfelt
apologies
cory
i
once
had
a
tai
chi
instructor
who
explained
the
difference
between
chinese
and
western
medicine
thus
western
medicine
is
based
on
corpses
things
that
you
discover
by
cutting
up
dead
bodies
and
pulling
them
apart
chinese
medicine
is
based
on
living
flesh
things
observed
from
vital
moving
humans
the
explanation
like
all
good
propaganda
is
stirring
and
stilted
and
not
particularly
accurate
and
gummy
as
the
hook
from
a
song
sticky
in
your
mind
in
the
noontime
when
the
world
takes
on
a
hallucinatory
hypperreal
clarity
like
now
as
i
sit
here
in
my
underwear
on
the
roof
of
a
sanatorium
in
the
back
woods
off
route
far
enough
from
the
perpetual
construction
of
boston
that
it
merely
a
cloud
of
dust
like
a
herd
of
distant
buffalo
charging
the
plains
like
now
as
i
sit
here
with
a
pencil
up
my
nose
thinking
about
homebrew
lobotomies
and
would
it
be
nice
if
i
gave
myself
one
deep
breath
the
difference
between
chinese
medicine
and
western
medicine
is
the
dissection
versus
the
observation
of
the
thing
in
motion
the
difference
between
reading
a
story
and
studying
a
story
is
the
difference
between
living
the
story
and
killing
the
story
and
looking
at
its
guts
school
we
sat
in
english
class
and
we
dissected
the
stories
that
i
escaped
into
laid
open
their
abdomens
and
tagged
their
organs
covered
their
genitals
with
polite
sterile
drapes
recorded
dutiful
notes
that
told
us
what
the
story
was
about
but
never
what
the
story
stories
are
propaganda
virii
that
slide
past
your
critical
immune
system
and
insert
themselves
directly
into
your
emotions
kill
them
and
cut
them
open
and
they
as
naked
as
a
nightclub
in
daylight
the
theme
the
first
step
in
dissecting
a
story
is
euthanizing
it
what
is
the
theme
of
this
story
let
me
kill
my
story
before
i
start
it
so
that
i
can
dissect
it
and
understand
it
the
theme
of
this
story
is
would
you
rather
be
smart
or
happy
this
is
a
work
of
propaganda
it
a
story
about
choosing
smarts
over
happiness
except
if
i
give
the
pencil
a
push
then
it
a
story
about
choosing
happiness
over
smarts
it
a
morality
play
and
the
first
character
is
about
to
take
the
stage
he
a
foil
for
the
theme
so
he
drawn
in
simple
lines
here
he
is
art
berry
was
born
to
argue
there
are
born
assassins
bred
to
kill
raised
on
cunning
and
speed
they
are
the
stuff
of
legend
remorseless
and
unstoppable
there
are
born
ballerinas
confectionery
girls
whose
parents
subject
them
to
rigors
every
bit
as
intense
as
the
tripwire
and
poison
on
which
the
assassins
are
reared
there
are
children
born
to
practice
medicine
or
law
children
born
to
serve
their
nations
and
die
heroically
in
the
noble
tradition
of
their
forebears
children
born
to
tread
the
boards
or
shred
the
turf
or
leave
smoking
rubber
on
the
racetrack
art
earliest
memory
a
dream
he
is
stuck
in
the
waiting
room
of
one
of
the
innumerable
doctors
who
attended
him
in
his
infancy
he
is
perhaps
three
and
his
attention
span
is
already
as
robust
as
it
will
ever
be
and
in
his
dream
which
is
fast
becoming
a
nightmare
he
is
bored
silly
the
only
adornment
in
the
waiting
room
is
an
empty
cylinder
that
once
held
toy
blocks
its
label
colorfully
illustrates
the
blocks
which
look
like
they
be
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
fun
if
someone
had
lost
them
all
near
the
cylinder
is
a
trio
of
older
children
infinitely
fascinating
they
confer
briefly
then
do
to
the
cylinder
and
it
unravels
extruding
into
the
third
dimension
turning
into
a
stack
of
blocks
aha
thinks
art
on
waking
this
is
another
piece
of
the
secret
knowledge
that
older
people
possess
the
strange
magic
that
is
used
to
operate
cars
and
elevators
and
shoelaces
art
waits
patiently
over
the
next
year
for
a
grownup
to
show
him
how
the
trick
works
but
none
ever
does
many
other
mysteries
are
revealed
each
one
more
disappointingly
mundane
than
the
last
even
flying
a
plane
seemed
easy
enough
when
the
nice
stew
let
him
ride
up
in
the
cockpit
for
a
while
en
route
to
new
york
art
awe
at
the
complexity
of
adult
knowledge
fell
away
by
the
age
of
five
he
was
stuck
in
a
sort
of
perpetual
terrible
twos
fearlessly
shouting
no
at
the
world
every
rule
arguing
the
morals
and
reason
behind
them
until
the
frustrated
adults
whom
he
was
picking
on
gave
up
and
swatted
him
or
told
him
that
that
was
just
how
it
was
in
the
easter
of
his
sixth
year
an
and
visit
to
church
with
his
gran
turned
into
a
raging
holy
war
that
had
the
parishioners
and
the
clergy
arguing
with
him
in
teams
and
relays
it
started
innocently
enough
why
does
god
care
if
we
take
off
our
hats
gran
but
the
nosy
ladies
in
the
nearby
pews
could
bear
to
simply
listen
in
and
the
argument
spread
like
ripples
on
a
pond
out
as
far
as
the
pulpit
where
the
priest
decided
to
squash
the
whole
line
of
inquiry
with
some
philosophical
word
games
from
descartes
in
which
the
objective
truth
of
reality
is
used
to
prove
the
beneficence
of
god
and
and
culminates
with
i
think
therefore
i
am
father
ferlenghetti
even
managed
to
work
it
into
the
thread
of
the
sermon
but
before
he
could
go
on
art
shrill
little
voice
answered
from
within
the
congregation
amazingly
the
had
managed
to
assimilate
all
of
descartes
fairly
tricksy
riddles
in
as
long
as
it
took
to
describe
them
and
then
went
on
to
use
those
same
arguments
to
prove
the
necessary
cruelty
of
god
followed
by
the
necessary
nonexistence
of
the
supreme
being
and
gran
tried
to
take
him
home
then
but
the
priest
who
watched
jesuits
play
intellectual
table
tennis
and
recognized
a
natural
when
he
saw
one
called
him
to
the
pulpit
whence
art
took
on
the
entire
congregation
singly
and
in
bunches
as
they
assailed
his
reasoning
and
he
built
it
back
up
laying
rhetorical
traps
that
they
blundered
into
with
all
the
cunning
of
a
cabbage
father
ferlenghetti
laughed
and
clarified
the
points
when
they
were
stuttered
out
by
some
rhetorical
amateur
from
the
audience
then
sat
back
and
marveled
as
art
did
his
thing
not
much
was
getting
done
sermonizing
and
there
was
still
the
communion
to
be
administered
but
god
knew
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
the
congregation
was
engaged
so
thoroughly
with
coming
to
grips
with
god
and
what
their
faith
meant
afterwards
when
art
was
returned
to
his
scandalized
gran
father
ferlenghetti
made
a
point
of
warmly
embracing
her
and
telling
her
that
art
was
welcome
at
his
pulpit
any
time
and
suggested
a
future
in
the
seminary
gran
was
amazed
and
blushed
under
her
sunday
powder
and
the
clawed
hand
on
his
shoulder
became
a
caress
the
theme
of
this
story
is
choosing
smarts
over
happiness
or
maybe
happiness
over
smarts
art
a
good
guy
he
smart
as
hell
that
his
schtick
if
he
were
a
cartoon
character
he
be
the
poindexter
who
is
all
the
time
dispelling
the
mysteries
that
fascinate
his
buddies
it
not
easy
being
art
friend
which
is
of
course
how
art
not
his
real
name
ended
up
sitting
stories
over
the
woodsy
massachusetts
countryside
hot
august
wind
ruffling
his
hair
and
blowing
up
the
legs
of
his
boxers
pencil
in
his
nose
euthanizing
his
story
preparatory
to
dissecting
it
in
order
to
preserve
the
narrative
integrity
art
not
his
real
name
may
take
some
liberties
with
the
truth
this
is
autobiographical
fiction
after
all
not
an
autobiography
call
me
art
not
my
real
name
i
am
an
in
the
eastern
standard
tribe
though
i
spent
most
of
my
life
in
and
at
various
latitudes
of
zulu
which
means
that
my
poor
pineal
gland
has
all
but
forgotten
how
to
do
its
job
without
that
i
drown
it
in
melatonin
precursors
and
treat
it
to
sessions
in
the
glare
of
my
travel
lantern
the
tribes
are
taking
over
the
world
you
can
track
our
progress
by
the
rise
of
minor
traffic
accidents
the
are
terrible
terrible
drivers
daylight
savings
time
is
a
widowmaker
stay
off
the
roads
on
leap
forward
day
here
is
the
second
character
in
the
morality
play
she
the
love
interest
was
we
broke
up
just
before
i
got
sent
to
the
sanatorium
our
circadians
compatible
april
was
the
day
that
art
nearly
killed
the
first
and
only
woman
he
ever
really
loved
it
was
her
fault
art
car
was
running
low
on
lard
after
a
week
in
the
benelux
countries
where
the
residents
were
all
codgers
who
guarded
their
arteries
from
the
depredations
of
the
frytrap
as
jealously
as
they
squirreled
their
money
away
from
the
taxman
he
was
therefore
thrilled
and
delighted
to
be
back
on
british
soil
where
grease
ran
like
water
and
his
runabout
could
be
kept
easily
and
cheaply
fuelled
and
the
vodka
could
run
down
his
gullet
instead
of
into
his
tank
he
was
in
the
kensington
high
street
on
a
sleepy
sunday
morning
back
in
edt
and
the
gps
was
showing
insufficient
to
even
gauge
traffic
between
his
geoloc
and
the
camden
high
where
he
kept
his
rooms
when
the
gps
ca
find
enough
peers
on
the
relay
network
to
color
its
maps
with
traffic
data
you
know
you
hit
a
sweet
spot
in
the
city
a
moment
of
grace
where
the
roads
are
very
nearly
exclusively
yours
so
he
whistled
a
jaunty
tune
and
swilled
his
coffium
a
fad
that
had
just
made
it
to
the
uk
thanks
to
the
loosening
of
rules
governing
the
disposal
of
heavy
water
in
the
eu
the
java
just
would
cool
off
remaining
hot
enough
to
guarantee
optimal
caffeine
osmosis
right
down
to
the
last
drop
if
he
was
jittery
it
was
no
more
so
than
was
customary
for
estalists
at
and
he
was
driving
safely
and
with
due
caution
if
the
woman
had
looked
out
before
stepping
off
the
kerb
and
into
the
anemically
thin
road
if
she
been
wearing
stylish
black
in
the
pitchy
dark
of
the
curve
before
the
royal
garden
hotel
if
she
had
stepped
in
front
of
his
he
would
have
merely
swerved
and
sworn
and
given
her
a
bit
of
a
fright
but
she
did
she
was
she
did
and
he
kicked
the
brake
as
hard
as
he
could
twisted
the
wheel
likewise
and
still
clipped
her
hipside
and
sent
her
before
the
runabout
did
its
own
barrel
roll
making
three
complete
revolutions
across
the
kensington
high
before
lodging
in
the
royal
garden
hotel
shrubs
art
was
covered
in
scorching
molten
coffium
screaming
and
clawing
at
his
eyes
upside
down
when
the
porters
from
the
royal
garden
opened
his
runabout
door
undid
his
safety
harness
and
pulled
him
out
from
behind
the
rapidly
flacciding
airbag
they
plunged
his
face
into
the
ornamental
birdbath
which
had
a
skin
of
ice
that
shattered
on
his
nose
and
jangled
against
his
jawbone
as
the
icy
water
cooled
the
coffium
and
stopped
the
terrible
terrible
burning
he
ended
up
on
his
knees
sputtering
and
blowing
and
shivering
and
cleared
his
eyes
in
time
to
see
the
woman
he
hit
being
carried
out
of
the
middle
of
the
road
on
a
human
travois
made
of
the
porters
linked
arms
of
red
wool
and
gold
brocade
assholes
she
was
hollering
i
could
have
a
goddamn
spinal
injury
you
not
supposed
to
move
me
look
miss
one
porter
said
a
young
chap
with
the
kind
of
fantastic
dentition
that
only
an
insecure
teabag
would
ever
pay
for
teeth
so
white
and
flawless
they
strobed
in
the
sodium
streetlamps
look
we
can
leave
you
in
the
middle
of
the
road
right
and
not
move
you
like
we
supposed
to
but
if
we
do
that
chances
are
you
going
to
get
run
over
before
the
paramedics
get
here
and
then
you
certainly
have
a
spinal
injury
and
a
crushed
skull
besides
like
as
not
do
you
follow
me
you
she
said
pointing
a
long
and
accusing
finger
at
art
you
do
you
watch
where
you
going
you
fool
you
could
have
killed
me
art
shook
water
off
his
face
and
blew
a
mist
from
his
dripping
moustache
sorry
he
said
weakly
she
had
an
american
accent
californian
maybe
a
litigious
stridency
that
tightened
his
sphincter
like
an
alum
enema
and
miraculously
flensed
him
of
the
impulse
to
argue
sorry
she
said
as
the
porters
lowered
her
gently
to
the
narrow
strip
turf
out
beside
the
sidewalk
sorry
jesus
is
that
the
best
you
can
do
well
you
step
out
in
front
of
my
car
he
said
trying
to
marshal
some
spine
she
attempted
to
sit
up
then
slumped
back
down
wincing
you
were
going
too
fast
i
do
think
so
he
said
i
pretty
sure
i
was
doing
that
five
clicks
under
the
limit
of
course
the
gps
will
tell
for
sure
at
the
mention
of
empirical
evidence
she
seemed
to
lose
interest
in
being
angry
give
me
a
phone
will
you
mortals
may
be
promiscuous
with
their
handsets
but
for
a
tribalist
relationship
with
one
comm
is
deeply
personal
art
would
have
sooner
shared
his
underwear
but
he
hit
her
with
his
car
reluctantly
art
passed
her
his
comm
the
woman
stabbed
at
the
handset
with
the
fingers
of
her
left
hand
squinting
at
it
in
the
dim
light
eventually
she
clamped
it
to
her
head
johnny
linda
yes

still
in
london
how
tricks
out
there
good
good
to
hear
how
marybeth

grinned
devilishly
i
just
got
hit
by
a
car
no
just
now
five
minutes
ago
of
course
i
hurt
i
think
he
broke
my
hip
maybe
my
spine
too
yes
i
can
wiggle
my
toes
maybe
he
shattered
a
disc
and
it
sawing
through
the
cord
right
now
concussion
oh
almost
certainly
pain
and
suffering
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life
missed
wages
she
looked
up
at
art
you
insured
right
art
nodded
miserably
fishing
for
an
argument
that
would
not
come
half
a
mil
easy
easy
get
the
papers
going
will

i
call
you
when
the
ambulance
gets
here

love
you
too
bye
bye
bye
johnny
i
got
to
go
bye
she
made
a
kissy
noise
and
tossed
the
comm
back
at
art
he
snatched
it
out
of
the
air
in
a
panic
closed
its
cover
reverentially
and
slipped
it
back
in
his
jacket
pocket
she
said
crooking
a
finger
he
knelt
beside
her
i
linda
she
said
shaking
his
hand
then
pulling
it
to
her
chest
art
art
said
art
here
the
deal
art

no
one
fault
ok

was
dark
you
were
driving
under
the
limit

with
due
caution

of
those
things
but
did
hit

once
the
messy
business
of
negotiating
eu
healthcare
for
foreign
nationals
had
been
sorted
out
with
the
emts
and
the
casualty
intake
triage
once
they
both
been
digested
and
shat
out
by
a
dozen
diagnostic
devices
from
to
mris
once
the
harried
house
officers
had
impersonally
prodded
them
and
presented
them
both
with
hardcopy
faqs
for
their
various
injuries
burns
mild
shock
for
art
pelvic
dislocation
minor
kidney
bruising
broken
femur
whiplash
concussion
and
mandible
trauma
for
linda
they
found
themselves
in
adjacent
beds
in
the
recovery
room
which
bustled
as
though
it
too
were
working
on
busy
as
a
restaurant
on
a
saturday
night
art
had
an
iv
taped
to
the
inside
of
his
left
arm
dripping
saline
and
tranqs
making
him
logy
and
challenging
his
circadians
still
he
was
the
more
mobile
of
the
two
as
linda
was
swaddled
in
smartcasts
that
both
immobilized
her
and
massaged
her
all
the
while
osmosing
transdermal
antiinflammatories
and
painkillers
he
tottered
the
two
steps
to
the
chair
at
her
bedside
and
shook
her
hand
again
do
take
this
the
wrong
way
but
you
look
like
hell
he
said
she
smiled
her
jaw
made
an
audible
pop
get
a
picture
will
you
it
be
good
in
court
he
chuckled
no
seriously
get
a
picture
so
he
took
out
his
comm
and
snapped
a
couple
pix
including
one
with
nightvision
filters
on
to
compensate
for
the
dimmed
recovery
room
lighting
you
a
cool
customer
you
know
that
he
said
as
he
tucked
his
camera
away
not
so
cool
this
is
all
a
coping
strategy
i
pretty
shook
up
you
want
to
know
the
truth
i
could
have
died
what
were
you
doing
on
the
street
at
three
am
anyway
i
was
upset
so
i
took
a
walk
thought
i
get
something
to
eat
or
a
beer
or
something
you
have
been
here
long
huh
she
laughed
and
it
turned
into
a
groan
what
the
hell
is
wrong
with
the
english
anyway
the
sun
sets
and
the
city
rolls
up
its
streets
it
not
like
they
got
this
great
tradition
of
staying
home
and
surfing
cable
or
anything
they
all
snug
in
their
beds
farting
away
their
lentil
roasts
that
it
you
ca
get
a
steak
here
to
save
your
life
mad
cows
all
of
if
i
see
one
more
gray
soy
sausage
i
going
to
kill
the
waitress
and
eat
you
just
need
to
get
hooked
up
he
said
once
we
out
of
here

take
you
out
for
a
genuine
blood
pudding
roast
beef

oily
chips

phone
again
uh
i
think
you
going
to
have
to
dial
for
me
that
give
me
the
number
she
did
and
he
cradled
his
comm
to
her
head
he
was
close
enough
to
her
that
he
could
hear
the
tinny
distinctive
ringing
of
a
namerican
circuit
at
the
other
end
he
heard
her
shallow
breathing
heard
her
jaw
creak
he
smelled
her
shampoo
a
smell
smelled
a
hint
of
her
sweat
a
cord
stood
out
on
her
neck
merging
in
an
elegant
vee
with
her
collarbone
an
arrow
pointing
at
the
swell
of
her
breast
under
her
paper
gown
toby
it
linda
a
munchkin
voice
chittered
down
the
line
shut
up
ok

in
the
hospital

a
car

send
you
the
faqs
i
just

heaved
a
sigh

her
eyes

i
wanted
to
say

right
sorry
it
came
to
this
you

ok
i
be

i
just
did
want
to
leave
you
hanging
she
sounded
groggy
but

a
sob

ca

i
on
a
shitload
of
dope

too
she
looked
up
at
art
my
boyfriend
not
sure
who
leaving
who
at
this
point
thanks
she
closed
her
eyes
her
eyelids
were
mauve
a
tracery
of
pink
veins
she
snored
softly
art
set
an
alarm
that
would
wake
him
up
in
time
to
meet
his
lawyer
folded
up
his
comm
and
crawled
back
into
bed
his
circadians
swelled
and
crashed
against
the
sides
of
his
skull
and
before
he
knew
it
he
was
out
hospitals
operate
around
the
clock
but
they
still
have
their
own
circadians
the
noontime
staff
were
still
overworked
and
harried
but
chipper
and
efficient
too
without
the
jitters
of
the
night
before
art
and
linda
were
efficiently
fed
watered
and
evacuated
then
left
to
their
own
devices
blinking
in
the
weak
english
sunlight
that
streamed
through
the
windows
the
lawyers
worked
it
out
i
think
art
said
good
good
news
she
was
her
words
art
figured
her
temper
was
drugged
senseless
and
it
gave
him
the
courage
to
ask
her
the
question
that
been
on
his
mind
since
they
met
can
i
ask
you
something
it
may
be
offensive
i
may
be
offended
do
you
do
lot
i
mean
the
insurance
thing
she
snorted
then
moaned
it
the
los
angeles
lottery
dude
i
have
done
it
before
but
i
was
starting
to
feel
a
little
left
out
to
tell
the
truth
i
thought
screenplays
were
the
la
lotto
naw
a
good
lotto
is
one
you
can
win
she
favored
him
with
half
a
smile
and
he
saw
that
she
had
a
lopsided
dimple
you
from
la
then
got
it
in
one
orange
county
i
a
failed
actor
grandpa
once
had
a
line
in
a
hitchcock
film
mom
was
the
ditzy
neighbor
on
a
fox
sitcom
in
the
i
still
waiting
for
my
moment
in
the
sun
you
live
here
for
now
since
september
i
from
toronto
canadia
goddamn
snowbacks
what
are
you
doing
in
london
his
comm
rang
giving
him
a
moment
to
gather
his
cover
story
hello
art
it
fede
federico
was
another
provocateur
in
gmt
he
was
exactly
art
superior
the
tribes
did
work
like
that
but
he
had
seniority
fede
can
i
call
you
back
look
i
heard
about
your
accident
and
i
would
have
called
but
urgent
art
groaned
and
rolled
his
eyes
in
linda
direction
to
let
her
know
that
he
too
was
exasperated
by
the
call
then
retreated
to
the
other
side
of
his
bed
and
hunched
over
what
is
it
we
been
sniffed
i
positive
art
groaned
again
fede
lived
in
perennial
terror
of
being
found
out
and
exposed
as
an
estribesman
fired
deported
humiliated
he
was
always
at
least
positive
and
the
extra
fifth
was
hardly
an
anomaly
what
up
now
it
the
vp
of
hr
at
telekom
he
called
me
in
for
a
meeting
this
afternoon
wants
to
go
over
the
core
hours
recommendation
fede
was
a
mckinsey
consultant
offline
producing
inflammatory
recommendation
packages
for
fortune
companies
he
was
working
the
angle
pushing
for
extra
daycare
time
off
for
sick
relatives
and
spouses
the
last
policy
binder
dumped
on
had
contained
enough
obscure
clauses
that
an
employee
who
was
sufficiently
could
conceivably
claim
days
of
paid
leave
a
year
now
he
was
pushing
for
the
abolishment
of
core
hours
corporate
eurospeak
for
the
time
after
lunch
but
before
afternoon
naps
when
everyone
showed
up
at
the
office
so
that
they
could
get
some
enough
of
this
and
gmt
would
be
the
laughingstock
of
the
world
and
so
caught
up
in
internecine
struggles
that
the
clear
superiority
of
the
est
ethos
would
sweep
them
away
that
was
the
theory
anyway
of
course
there
were
rival
tribalists
in
every
single
management
consulting
firm
in
the
world
working
against
us
management
consultants
have
always
worked
on
networks
after
all
it
was
a
very
short
step
from
interning
your
frat
buddy
to
interning
your
tribesman
that
it
a
meeting
jesus
it
just
a
meeting
he
probably
wants
you
to
reassure
him
before
he
presents
to
the
ceo
is
all
no
i
sure
that
not
it
he
got
us
sniffed
both
of
us
he
been
going
through
the
stuff
too
which
is
totally
outside
of
his
bailiwick
i
tried
to
call
him
yesterday
and
his
voicemail
rolled
over
to
a
boardroom
in
house
house
was
the
usability
lab
a
nice
old
row
of
connected
victorian
townhouses
just
off
picadilly
it
was
where
art
consulted
out
of
also
usability
specialists
product
designers
experience
engineers
cranks
and
other
tinkerers
with
the
mind
they
were
the
hairface
hackers
of
art
generation
unmanageable
creative
darlings
no
surprise
that
the
vp
of
hr
would
have
cause
to
spend
a
little
with
someone
there
try
telling
fede
that
though
all
right
fede
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
just
just
be
careful
sanitize
your
storage
i
pushing
a
new
personal
key
to
you
now
too
here
i
read
you
the
fingerprint
the
key
would
be
an
unimaginably
long
string
of
and
just
to
make
sure
that
it
was
intercepted
and
changed
en
route
fede
wanted
to
read
him
a
slightly
less
long
mathematical
fingerprint
hashed
out
of
it
once
it
arrived
art
was
supposed
to
generate
a
fingerprint
from
fede
new
key
and
compare
it
to
the
one
that
fede
wanted
him
to
jot
down
art
closed
his
eyes
and
reclined
all
right
i
got
a
pen
he
said
though
he
had
no
such
thing
fede
read
him
the
long
long
string
of
digits
and
characters
and
he
repeated
them
back
pretending
to
be
noting
them
down
paranoid
bastard
ok
i
got
it
i
get
you
a
new
key
later
today
all
right
do
it
quick
man
whatever
fede
back
off
ok
sorry
sorry
oh
and
feel
better
all
right
bye
fede
what
was
linda
had
her
neck
craned
around
to
watch
him
he
slipped
into
his
cover
story
with
a
conscious
effort
i
a
consultant
my
coworkers
are
all
paranoid
about
a
deadline
she
rolled
her
eyes
not
another
one
god
look
we
go
out
for
dinner
say
a
word
about
the
kerb
design
or
the
waiter
or
the
menu
or
the
presentation
ok
ok
i
serious
art
solemnly
crossed
his
heart
who
else
do
you
know
in
the
biz
my
ex
he
would
or
could
shut
up
about
how
much
everything
sucked
he
was
right
but
so
what
i
wanted
to
enjoy
it
suckitude
and
all
ok
i
promise
we
going
out
for
dinner
then
the
minute
i
can
walk
you
taking
me
out
for
as
much
flesh
and
entrails
as
i
can
eat
it
a
deal
and
then
they
both
slept
again
met
cute
huh
linda
was
short
and
curvy
dark
eyes
and
pursed
lips
and
an
hourglass
figure
that
she
thought
made
her
look
topheavy
and
but
i
thought
she
was
fabulous
and
soft
and
bouncy
she
tasted
like
pepper
and
her
hair
smelled
of
the
abstruse
polymers
that
kept
it
hanging
in
a
brusque
bob
that
brushed
her
firm
long
jawline
i
getting
a
sunburn
and
the
pebbles
on
the
roof
are
digging
into
my
ass
i
do
know
if
i
going
to
push
the
pencil
or
not
but
if
i
do
it
going
to
be
somewhere
more
comfortable
than
this
roof
except
that
the
roof
door
which
i
had
wedged
open
before
i
snuck
away
from
my
attendants
and
slunk
up
the
stairwell
is
locked
the
small
cairn
of
pebbles
that
i
created
in
front
of
it
has
been
strewn
apart
it
is
locked
tight
and
me
without
my
comm
ah
me
i
take
an
inventory
of
my
person
a
pencil
a
hospital
gown
a
pair
of
boxer
shorts
and
a
head
full
of
bad
cess
i
am
above
the
summery
muggy
verdant
massachusetts
countryside
it
is
very
hot
and
i
am
turning
the
color
of
the
barbie
aisle
at
fao
schwartz
a
kind
of
labial
pink
that
is
both
painful
and
perversely
cheerful
i
spent
my
life
going
in
the
back
door
and
coming
out
the
side
door
the
way
it
is
now
when
it
only
takes
two
years
for
your
job
to
morph
into
something
that
would
have
been
unimaginable
months
before
it
not
really
practical
to
go
in
through
the
front
door
not
really
practical
to
get
the
degree
the
certification
the
appropriate
experience
i
mean
even
if
you
went
back
to
university
the
major
you
need
by
the
time
you
graduated
would
be
in
a
subject
that
had
been
invented
when
you
enrolled
so
i
good
at
back
doors
and
side
doors
it
what
the
tribe
does
for
me
provides
me
with
entries
into
places
where
i
technically
do
belong
and
thank
god
for
them
anyway
without
the
tribes
would
be
qualified
to
do
worth
doing
going
out
the
side
door
has
backfired
on
me
today
though
oh
shit
i
peer
over
the
building
edge
down
into
the
parking
lot
the
cars
are
thinly
spread
the
weather
too
fine
for
anyone
out
there
in
the
real
world
to
be
visiting
with
their
crazy
relatives
half
a
dozen
beaters
are
parked
down
there
that
the
estalists
call
fartmobiles
i
been
driving
something
much
the
same
on
that
fateful
leap
forward
day
in
london
i
left
something
out
of
my
inventory
pebbles
the
roof
is
littered
covered
with
a
layer
of
gray
round
riverstones
about
the
size
of
wasabi
chickpeas
no
one
down
there
is
going
to
notice
me
all
the
way
up
here
not
without
that
i
give
them
a
sign
a
cracked
windshield
or
two
ought
to
do
it
i
gather
a
small
pile
of
rocks
by
the
roof
edge
and
carefully
take
aim
i
have
to
be
cautious
careful
a
pebble
dropped
from
this
height
i
remember
the
stories
about
the
penny
dropped
from
the
top
of
the
cn
tower
that
sunk
six
inches
into
the
concrete
below
i
select
a
small
piece
of
gravel
and
carefully
aim
for
the
windshield
of
a
little
blue
sony
veddic
and
it
bombs
away
i
can
only
follow
the
progress
for
a
few
seconds
before
my
eyes
can
no
longer
disambiguate
it
from
the
surrounding
countryside
what
little
i
do
see
of
its
trajectory
is
disheartening
though
the
wind
whips
it
away
on
an
almost
horizontal
parabola
off
towards
boston
forgetting
all
about
newton
i
try
lobbing
and
then
hurling
the
gravel
downward
but
it
gets
taken
away
off
to
neverneverland
and
the
windscreens
remain
whole
i
go
off
to
prospect
for
bigger
rocks
you
know
the
sort
of
horror
movie
where
the
suspense
builds
and
builds
and
builds
partially
collapsed
at
regular
intervals
by
something
jumping
out
and
yelling
boo
whereupon
the
heroes
have
to
flee
deeper
into
danger
and
the
tension
rises
and
rises
you
know
how
sometimes
the
director
just
does
know
when
to
quit
and
the
bogeymen
keep
jumping
out
and
yelling
boo
the
wobbly
bridges
keep
on
collapsing
the
small
arms
fire
keeps
blowing
out
more
windows
in
the
office
tower
it
not
like
the
tension
goes
away
it
just
get
boring
boring
tension
you
know
that
the
climax
is
coming
soon
that
any
minute
now
our
hero
will
face
down
the
archvillain
and
either
kick
his
ass
or
have
his
ass
kicked
the
whole
world
riding
on
the
outcome
you
know
that
it
will
be
satisfying
with
much
explosions
and
partial
nudity
you
know
that
afterward
our
hero
will
retire
to
the
and
chill
out
and
collect
kisses
from
the
love
interest
and
that
all
have
a
moment
to
get
our
adrenals
back
under
control
before
the
hand
pops
out
of
the
grave
and
we
all
give
a
nervous
jump
and
start
eagerly
anticipating
the
sequel
you
just
wish
it
would
already
you
just
wish
that
the
little
climaces
could
be
taken
as
read
that
the
director
would
trust
the
audience
to
know
that
our
hero
really
does
wade
through
an
entire
ocean
of
shit
en
route
to
the
final
showdown
i
bored
with
being
excited
i
been
betrayed
shot
at
institutionalized
and
stranded
on
the
roof
of
a
nuthouse
and
i
just
want
the
fucking
climax
to
come
by
and
happen
to
me
so
that
i
can
know
smart
or
happy
i
found
a
that
was
being
used
to
hold
down
the
tar
paper
around
an
i
should
used
that
to
hold
the
door
open
but
it
way
the
hell
the
other
side
of
the
roof
and
i
been
really
pleased
with
my
little
pebbly
doorstop
besides
i
starting
to
suspect
that
the
doorjamb
did
fail
that
it
was
sabotaged
by
some
malevolently
playful
goon
from
the
sanatorium
an
object
lesson
or
something
i
heft
the
brick
i
release
the
brick
it
falls
and
falls
and
falls
and
hits
the
little
blue
fartmobile
square
on
the
trunk
punching
a
hole
through
the
cheap
aluminum
lid
and
the
fartmobile
explodes
first
there
is
a
geyser
of
blue
flame
as
the
puncture
wound
jets
a
stream
of
ignited
assoline
skyward
and
then
it
blows
back
into
the
tank
and
the
fartmobile
is
in
one
billion
shards
rising
like
a
parachute
in
an
updraft
i
can
feel
the
heat
on
my
bare
skin
even
from
this
distance
explosions
partial
nudity
somehow
though
i
know
that
this
is
the
climax
linda
did
like
to
argue
fight
yes
argue
no
that
was
going
to
be
a
problem
art
knew
but
when
you
falling
in
love
you
able
to
rationalize
all
kinds
of
things
the
yobs
who
cornered
them
on
the
way
out
of
a
bloody
supper
of
contraband
antisocial
animal
flesh
were
young
large
and
bristling
with
testosterone
they
wore
killsport
armor
with
strategic
transparent
panels
that
revealed
their
muscles
visible
through
the
likewise
transparent
insets
had
grafted
in
place
of
the
skin
that
covered
their
abs
and
quads
there
were
three
of
them
grinning
and
flexing
and
they
boxed
in
art
and
linda
in
the
tiny
shuttered
entrance
of
a
boots
pharmacy
evening
sir
evening
miss
one
said
hey
art
muttered
and
looked
over
the
yob
shoulder
trying
to
spot
a
secam
or
a
cop
neither
was
in
sight
i
wonder
if
we
could
beg
a
favor
of
you
another
said
sure
art
said
you
american
are
you
the
third
said
canadian
actually
marvelous
bloody
marvelous
i
hear
that
canada
a
lovely
place
how
are
you
enjoying
england
i
live
here
actually
i
like
it
a
lot
glad
to
hear
that
sir
and
you
miss
linda
was
halfway
behind
art
it
fine
good
to
hear
the
first
one
said
grinning
even
more
broadly
now
as
to
that
favor
my
friends
and
i
we
got
a
problem
we
grown
bored
of
our
wallets
they
are
dull
and
uninteresting
and
empty
the
third
one
interjected
with
a
little
stoned
giggle
oh
yes
and
empty
we
thought
well
perhaps
you
visitors
from
abroad
would
find
them
suitable
souvenirs
of
england
we
thought
perhaps
you
like
to
trade
like
art
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
he
had
been
mugged
in
london
but
he
heard
of
this
ever
since
a
pair
of
manchester
toughs
had
been
acquitted
based
on
the
claim
that
their
robbery
and
menacing
of
a
pakistani
couple
had
been
a
simple
misunderstanding
crafty
british
yobs
had
been
taking
off
increasingly
baroque
scores
from
tourists
art
felt
the
familiar
buzz
that
meant
he
was
about
to
get
into
an
argument
and
before
he
knew
it
he
was
talking
do
you
really
think
that
hold
up
in
court
i
think
that
even
the
dimmest
judge
would
be
able
to
tell
that
the
idea
of
a
canadian
being
mistaken
about
trading
two
wallets
full
of
cash
for
three
empty
ones
was
in
no
way
an
error
in
communication
really
now
if
you
going
to
mug
us
mug
you
sir
dear
oh
dear
who
mugging
you
the
first
one
said
well
in
that
case
you
wo
mind
if
we
say
no
right
well
it
would
be
rather
rude
the
first
said
after
all
we
offering
you
a
souvenir
in
the
spirit
of
transatlantic
solidarity
genuine
english
leather
mine
is
belonged
to
my
grandfather
let
me
see
it
art
said
beg
pardon
i
want
to
see
it
if
we
going
to
trade
i
should
be
able
to
examine
the
goods
first
right
all
right
sir
all
right
here
you
are
the
wallet
was
tattered
and
leather
and
it
was
indeed
made
in
england
as
the
frayed
tag
sewn
into
the
billfold
attested
art
turned
it
over
in
his
hands
then
still
smiling
emptied
the
card
slot
and
started
paging
through
the
id
lester
lester
swore
under
his
breath
les
actually
hand
those
over
please
they
do
come
with
the
wallet
they
do
but
surely
a
real
british
wallet
is
hardly
complete
without
real
british
identification
maybe
i
could
keep
the
nhs
card
something
to
show
around
to
americans
they
think
socialized
medicine
is
a
fairy
tale
you
know
i
really
must
insist
sir
fuck
it
les
the
second
one
said
reaching
into
his
pocket
this
is
stupid
get
the
money
and
let
push
off
it
not
that
easy
any
more
is
it
the
third
one
said
fellow
got
your
name
les
well
yes
of
course
i
do
art
said
but
so
what
you
three
are
hardly
nondescript
you
think
it
be
hard
to
pick
your
faces
out
of
a
rogues
gallery
oh
and
wait
a
minute
is
this
a
trade
what
happened
to
the
spirit
of
transatlantic
solidarity
right
les
said
do
matter
if
you
got
my
name
we
all
friends
right
sir
right
art
said
he
put
the
tattered
wallet
in
his
already
bulging
jacket
pocket
making
a
great
show
of
tamping
it
down
so
it
would
come
loose
once
his
hand
was
free
he
extended
it
art
berry
late
of
toronto
pleased
to
meetcha
les
shook
his
hand
i
les
these
are
my
friends
tony
and
tom
fuck
tom
the
second
one
said
les
you
stupid
cunt
now
they
got
our
names
too
the
hand
he
put
in
his
pocket
came
out
holding
a
tazer
that
sparked
and
hummed
got
ta
get
rid
of
now
art
smiled
and
reached
very
slowly
into
his
pocket
he
pulled
out
his
comm
dislodging
les
wallet
so
that
it
fell
to
the
street
les
tom
and
tony
stared
at
the
glowing
comm
in
his
hand
could
you
repeat
that
tom
i
do
think
the
operator
heard
you
clearly
tom
stared
dumbfounded
at
the
comm
watching
it
as
though
it
were
a
snake
the
numbers
were
clearly
visible
on
its
display
along
with
the
position
data
that
pinpointed
its
location
to
the
meter
les
turned
abruptly
and
began
walking
briskly
towards
the
tube
station
in
a
moment
tony
followed
leaving
tom
alone
the
tazer
still
hissing
and
spitting
his
face
contorted
with
frustrated
anger
and
he
feinted
with
the
tazer
barking
a
laugh
when
art
and
linda
cringed
back
then
he
took
off
at
a
good
run
after
his
mates
art
clamped
the
comm
to
his
head
they
gone
away
he
announced
prideful
did
you
get
that
exchange
there
were
three
of
them
and
they
gone
away
from
the
comm
came
a
tight
efficient
voice
a
male
emergency
operator
the
speech
was
accented
and
it
took
a
moment
to
place
it
then
art
remembered
that
the
overnight
emergency
had
been
outsourced
by
the
english
government
to
in
manila
yes
mr
berry
his
comm
had
already
transmitted
his
name
immigration
status
and
location
creating
a
degree
of
customization
more
typical
of
delivery
than
governmental
bureaucracies
that
was
bad
art
thought
professionally
gmt
polezeidom
was
meant
to
be
a
solid
wall
of
bureaucracy
courtesy
of
some
crafty
anonymous
pdtalist
please
stay
at
your
current
location
the
police
will
be
on
the
scene
shortly
very
well
done
sir
art
turned
to
linda
triumphant
ready
for
the
traditional
postrhetorical
accolades
that
witnesses
of
his
verbal
acrobatics
were
wont
to
dole
out
and
found
her
in
an
attitude
of
abject
terror
her
eyes
were
crazily
wide
the
whites
visible
around
the
irises
something
he
read
about
but
never
seen
firsthand
she
was
breathing
shallowly
and
had
gone
ashen
though
they
were
not
an
actual
couple
yet
art
tried
to
gather
her
into
his
arms
for
some
manly
comforting
but
she
was
stiff
in
his
embrace
and
after
a
moment
planted
her
palms
on
his
chest
and
pushed
him
back
firmly
even
aggressively
are
you
all
right
he
asked
he
was
adrenalized
flushed
if
they
decided
to
kill
she
said
spittle
flying
from
her
lips
oh
they
were
going
to
hurt
us
he
said
no
guts
at
all
you
did
know
that
where
do
you
get
off
playing
around
with
safety
why
the
hell
did
you
just
hand
over
your
wallet
call
the
cops
and
be
done
with
it
macho
fucking
horseshit
the
triumph
was
fading
fast
replaced
by
anger
what
wrong
with
you
do
you
always
have
to
snatch
defeat
from
the
jaws
of
victory
i
just
beat
off
those
three
assholes
without
raising
a
hand
and
all
you
want
to
do
is
criticize
christ
ok

time

can
hand
over
our
wallets

they
want
a
little
rape

the
rules

one
of
your
stupid
points
rape

serious
the
cops
arrived
then
two
of
them
on
scooters
looking
like
meter
maids
art
and
linda
glared
at
each
other
for
a
moment
then
forced
smiles
at
the
cops
who
had
dismounted
and
shed
their
helmets
they
were
young
men
in
their
twenties
and
to
art
they
looked
like
kids
playing
dress
up
evening
sir
miss
one
said
i
pc
mcgivens
and
this
is
pc
demoss
you
called
emergency
services
mcgivens
had
his
comm
out
and
it
was
pointed
at
them
slurping
in
their
identity
on
police
override
yes
art
said
but
it
ok
now
they
took
off
one
of
them
left
his
wallet

it
up
and
made
to
hand
it
to
pc
demoss
who
was
closer
the
cop
ignored
it
please
sir
put
that
down
we
gather
the
evidence
art
lowered
it
to
the
ground
felt
himself
blushing
his
hands
were
shaking
now
whether
from
embarrassment
triumph
or
hurt
he
could
say
he
held
up
his
palms
in
a
gesture
of
surrender
step
over
here
please
sir
pc
mcgivens
said
and
led
him
off
a
short
ways
while
pc
blaylock
closed
on
linda
now
sir
mcgivens
said
in
a
businesslike
way
please
tell
me
exactly
what
happened
so
art
did
tastefully
omitting
the
where
the
evening
festivities
had
begun
he
started
to
get
into
it
to
evangelize
his
bravery
with
the
phone
mcgivens
obliged
him
with
a
little
grin
very
good
now
again
please
sir
i
sorry
art
said
can
you
repeat
it
please
procedure
why
ca
really
say
sir
it
procedure
art
thought
about
arguing
but
managed
to
control
the
impulse
the
man
was
a
cop
he
was
a
foreigner
albeit
a
thoroughly
documented
one
and
what
would
it
cost
he
probably
left
something
out
anyway
he
retold
the
story
from
the
top
speaking
slowly
and
clearly
pc
mcgivens
aimed
his
comm
artwards
and
tapped
out
the
occasional
note
as
art
spoke
thank
you
sir
now
once
more
please
art
blew
out
an
exasperated
sigh
his
feet
hurt
and
his
bladder
was
swollen
with
drink
you
joking
no
sir
i
afraid
not
procedure
but
it
stupid
the
guys
who
tried
to
mug
us
are
long
gone
i
given
you
their
descriptions
you
have
their
but
they
did
not
yet
the
wallet
still
lay
where
art
had
dropped
it
pc
mcgivens
shook
his
head
slowly
as
though
marveling
at
the
previously
unsuspected
inanity
of
his
daily
round
all
very
true
sir
but
it
procedure
worked
out
by
some
clever
lad
using
statistics
all
this
it
increases
our
success
rate
here
it
was
some
busy
tribalist
provocateur
some
compatriot
of
fede
had
stirred
the
oats
into
her
majesty
royal
constabulary
art
snuck
a
look
at
linda
who
was
no
doubt
being
subjected
to
the
same
procedure
by
pc
demoss
she
lost
her
rigid
angry
posture
and
was
seemingly
amazingly
enjoying
herself
chatting
up
the
constable
like
an
old
pal
how
many
more
times
have
we
got
to
do
this
officer
this
is
the
last
time
you
have
to
repeat
it
to
me
art
professional
instincts
perked
up
at
the
weasel
words
in
the
sentence
to
you
who
else
do
i
need
to
go
over
this
with
the
officer
shook
his
head
caught
out
well
you
have
to
repeat
it
three
times
to
pc
demoss
once
he
done
with
your
friend
sir
procedure
how
about
this
art
says
how
about
i
record
this
last
statement
to
you
with
my
comm
and
then
i
can
it
three
times
for
pc
demoss
oh
i
sure
that
wo
do
sir
not
really
the
spirit
of
the
thing
is
it
and
what
the
spirit
of
the
thing
humiliation
boredom
an
exercise
in
raw
power
pc
mcgivens
lost
his
faint
smile
i
really
could
say
sir
now
again
if
you
please
what
if
i
do
please
i
have
been
assaulted
i
have
been
robbed
none
of
my
business
what
if
i
walk
away
right
now
not
really
allowed
sir
it
expected
that
everyone
in
england
subjects
her
will
assist
the
police
with
their
inquiries
required
actually
reminded
of
his
precarious
immigration
status
art
lost
his
attitude
once
more
for
you
three
more
times
for
your
partner
and
we
done
right
i
want
to
get
home
we
see
sir
art
recited
the
facts
a
third
time
and
they
waited
while
linda
finished
her
third
recounting
he
switched
over
to
pc
demoss
who
pointed
his
comm
expectantly
is
all
this
just
to
make
people
reluctant
to
call
the
cops
i
mean
this
whole
procedure
seems
like
a
hell
of
a
disincentive
just
the
way
we
do
things
sir
pc
demoss
said
without
rancor
now
have
it
if
you
please
from
a
few
yards
away
linda
laughed
at
something
pc
mcgivens
said
which
just
escalated
art
frustration
he
spat
out
the
description
three
times
fast
now
i
need
to
find
a
toilet
are
we
done
yet
not
sir
going
to
have
to
come
by
the
station
house
to
look
through
some
photos
there
a
toilet
there
it
ca
wait
that
long
officer
pc
demoss
gave
him
a
reproachful
look
i
sorry
all
right
art
said
i
lack
the
foresight
to
empty
my
bladder
before
being
accosted
in
the
street
that
being
said
can
we
arrive
at
some
kind
of
solution
in
his
head
art
was
already
writing
an
angry
letter
to
the
dripping
with
sarcasm
just
a
moment
sir
pc
demoss
said
he
conferred
briefly
with
his
partner
leaving
art
to
stare
ruefully
at
their
backs
and
avoid
linda
gaze
when
he
finally
met
it
she
gave
him
a
sunny
smile
it
seemed
that
she
at
least
was
angry
any
more
come
this
way
please
sir
pc
demoss
said
striking
off
for
the
high
street
there
a
pub
the
corner
where
you
can
use
the
facilities
it
was
nearly
dawn
before
they
finally
made
their
way
out
of
the
police
station
and
back
into
the
street
after
identifying
les
from
an
online
rogues
gallery
art
had
spent
the
next
six
hours
sitting
on
a
hard
bench
chording
desultorily
on
his
thigh
doing
some
housekeeping
this
business
of
being
an
was
complicated
in
the
extreme
though
it
had
sounded
like
a
good
idea
when
he
was
living
in
san
francisco
and
hating
every
inch
of
the
city
from
the
alleged
pizza
to
the
fucking
drivers
in
new
york
the
theory
went
drivers
used
their
horns
by
way
of
shouting
ole
as
in
ole
you
changed
lanes
ole
you
cut
me
off
ole
driving
on
the
sidewalk
while
in
san
francisco
a
honking
horn
meant
i
wish
you
were
dead
have
a
nice
day
dude
and
the
body
language
was
all
screwed
up
out
west
art
believed
that
your
entire
unconscious
affect
was
determined
by
your
upbringing
you
learned
how
to
stand
how
to
hold
your
face
in
repose
how
to
gesture
from
the
adults
around
you
while
you
were
growing
up
the
pacific
standard
tribe
always
seemed
a
little
bovine
to
him
their
facial
muscles
long
conditioned
to
relax
into
a
kind
of
spacey
gullible
senescence
beauty
too
your
local
definition
of
attractive
and
ugly
was
conditioned
by
the
people
around
you
at
puberty
there
was
a
pacific
look
that
was
indefinably
off
hard
to
say
what
it
was
just
that
when
he
went
out
to
a
bar
or
got
stuck
on
a
crowded
train
the
girls
just
did
seem
all
that
attractive
to
him
objectively
he
could
recognize
their
prettiness
but
it
did
stir
him
the
way
the
girls
cruising
the
chelsea
antiques
market
or
lounging
around
harvard
square
could
he
always
felt
at
a
slight
angle
to
reality
in
california
something
that
was
reinforced
by
his
continuous
efforts
in
the
tribe
from
chatting
and
gaming
until
the
sun
rose
dragging
his
ass
around
to
his
clients
in
a
kind
of
fog
before
going
home
catching
a
nap
and
hopping
back
online
at
or
when
the
nyc
early
risers
were
practicing
and
clattering
around
with
their
comms
gradually
he
penetrated
deeper
into
the
tribe
getting
invites
into
private
channels
intimate
environments
where
he
found
himself
spilling
the
most
private
details
of
his
life
the
tribe
stuck
together
finding
work
for
each
other
offering
advice
and
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
someone
offered
him
a
gig
that
was
fede
who
practically
invented
tribal
he
been
working
for
mckinsey
systematically
undermining
their
clients
with
plausibly
terrible
advice
creating
achilles
heels
that
their
competitors
could
exploit
the
entire
european
for
relay
networks
had
been
ceded
by
telekom
to
a
scrappy
band
of
at
t
labs
refugees
whose
new
jersey
headquarters
hosted
all
the
cellular
reputation
data
that
euros
comms
consulted
when
they
were
routing
their
calls
the
jersey
clients
had
funneled
a
nice
chunk
of
the
proceeds
to
fede
account
in
the
form
of
rigged
winnings
from
an
offshore
casino
that
the
tribe
used
to
launder
its
money
now
was
striking
back
angling
for
a
government
contract
in
massachusetts
a
fat
bit
of
pork
for
managing
payments
to
rightsholders
whose
media
was
assessed
at
the
masspike
tollbooths
were
a
fabulous
opportunity
to
skim
and
launder
and
spindle
money
in
plenty
and
massive
repertoire
combined
with
deutsche
telekom
teutonic
attention
to
detail
was
a
tough
combination
to
beat
needless
to
say
the
route
tribalists
who
had
the
existing
contract
needed
an
edge
and
would
pay
handsomely
for
it
london
nights
seemed
like
a
step
up
from
san
francisco
mornings
to
art
instead
of
getting
up
at
to
get
nyc
he
could
sleep
in
and
chat
them
up
through
the
night
the
euro
sensibility
with
its
many
statutory
holidays
and
extended
vacations
seemed
ideally
suited
to
a
double
agent
life
but
art
had
counted
on
the
tribalists
approach
to
his
work
they
obsessively
grepped
his
daily
feed
of
spreadsheets
memos
and
conversation
reports
for
any
of
ten
thousand
hot
keywords
querying
him
for
deeper
detail
on
trivial
bullshit
sessions
with
the
user
experience
engineers
his
comm
buzzed
and
blipped
at
all
hours
and
his
payoff
was
dependent
on
his
prompt
response
they
were
running
him
ragged
four
hours
in
the
police
station
gave
art
ample
opportunity
to
catch
up
on
the
backlog
of
finicky
queries
since
the
accident
he
been
distracted
and
tardy
and
had
begun
to
invent
his
responses
since
it
all
seemed
so
trivial
to
him
anyway
fede
had
sent
him
about
a
thousand
nagging
notes
reminding
him
to
generate
a
new
key
and
phone
with
the
fingerprint
christ
fede
had
been
with
mckinsey
for
most
of
his
adult
life
and
he
was
superparanoid
about
being
exposed
and
disgraced
in
their
ranks
art
experience
with
the
other
mckinsey
people
around
the
office
suggested
that
the
notion
of
any
of
those
overpaid
sniffing
their
traffic
was
about
as
likely
as
a
lightning
strike
heaving
a
dramatic
sigh
for
his
own
benefit
he
began
the
lengthy
process
of
generating
enough
randomness
to
seed
the
key
mashing
the
keyboard
whispering
nonsense
syllables
and
pointing
the
comm
camera
lens
at
arbitrary
corners
of
the
police
station
after
ten
minutes
of
the
comm
announced
that
he
been
sufficiently
random
and
prompted
him
for
a
passphrase
jesus
what
a
pain
in
the
ass
he
struggled
to
recall
all
the
words
to
the
theme
song
from
a
cbc
sitcom
he
watched
as
a
kid
and
then
his
comm
went
into
a
churn
as
it
laboriously
all
of
his
stored
files
with
the
new
key
leaving
art
to
login
while
he
waited
trepan

stood
up
and
blinked
he
approached
the
desk
sergeant
and
asked
if
he
thought
it
would
be
much
longer
the
sergeant
fiddled
with
a
comm
for
a
moment
then
said
oh

quite
done
with
you
sir
thank

art
repressed
a
vituperative
response
counted

then
thanked

thank

much
officer

i

you
at
the
front
doors
all
right
that
great
art
said
he
stretched
his
ass
was
numb
his
head
throbbed
and
he
wanted
to
strangle
linda
she
emerged
into
the
dawn
blinking
and
grinning
and
surprised
him
with
a
long
hug
sorry
i
was
so
snappish
before
she
said
i
was
just
scared
the
cops
say
that
you
were
quite
brave
thank
you
art
adrenals
as
he
tried
to
work
up
a
good
angry
head
of
steam
then
he
gave
up
it
all
right
let
go
get
some
breakfast
ok
the
is
aswarm
with
people
fire
engines
and
ambulances
there
a
siren
going
off
somewhere
down
in
the
bowels
of
the
sanatorium
and
still
i
ca
get
anyone
to
look
up
at
the
goddamned
roof
i
tried
hollering
myself
hoarse
into
the
updrafts
from
the
cheery
blaze
but
the
wind
against
me
my
shouts
rising
up
past
my
ears
i
tried
dropping
more
pebbles
but
the
winds
whip
them
away
and
i
learned
my
lesson
about
weirdly
i
not
worried
about
getting
into
trouble
i
already
been
involuntarily
committed
by
the
tribe
enemies
the
massed
and
devious
forces
of
the
pacific
daylight
tribe
and
the
greenwich
mean
tribe
i
am
officially
not
responsible
confused
and
prone
to
wandering
for
it
not
like
i
hurt
anyone
just
decremented
the
number
of
roadworthy
fartmobiles
by
one
i
got
up
this
morning
at
four
awakened
by
the
tiniest
sound
from
the
ward
corridors
a
wheel
from
a
pharmaceuticals
tray
maybe
three
weeks
on
medically
prescribed
sleepytime
drugs
have
barely
scratched
the
surface
of
the
damage
wrought
by
years
of
circadian
abuse
i
been
having
a
fragile
shadow
of
a
dream
the
ghost
of
a
rem
cycle
and
it
was
the
old
dream
the
dream
of
the
doctor
office
and
the
older
kids
who
could
manage
the
trick
of
making
a
picture
into
reality
i
went
from
that
state
to
total
wakefulness
in
an
instant
and
knew
to
a
certainty
that
i
would
be
sleeping
again
any
time
soon
i
paced
my
small
room
smelled
the
cheerful
flowers
my
cousins
brought
last
week
when
they
visited
from
toronto
watched
the
horizon
for
signs
of
a
breaking
dawn
i
wished
futilely
for
my
comm
and
a
nice
private
channel
where
i
could
sling
some
bullshit
and
have
some
slung
in
my
direction
just
connect
with
another
human
being
at
a
nice
safe
remove
they
chide
me
for
arguing
on
the
ward
call
it
belligerence
and
try
to
sidetrack
me
with
questions
about
my
motivations
a
tactic
rating
barely
above
ad
hominems
in
my
book
no
one
to
talk
to
the
other
patients
get
violent
or
nod
off
depending
on
their
medication
levels
and
the
staff
just
patronize
me
four
am
and
i
going
nuts
hamsters
in
my
mind
spinning
their
wheels
at
a
thousand
rpm
chittering
away
i
snort
if
i
was
crazy
to
begin
with
sure
getting
there
the
hamsters
wo
stop
arguing
with
each
other
over
all
the
terrible
errors
of
judgment
i
made
to
get
here
trusting
the
tribe
trusting
strangers
argue
argue
argue
god
if
only
someone
else
were
around
i
could
argue
the
definition
of
sanity
i
could
argue
the
ethics
of
involuntary
committal
i
could
argue
the
food
but
my
head
is
full
of
argument
and
there
nowhere
to
spill
it
and
soon
enough
i
be
talking
aloud
arguing
with
the
air
like
the
schizoids
on
the
ward
who
muttergrumbleshout
through
the
day
and
through
the
night
why
did
i
just
leave
london
when
i
could
come
home
move
in
with
gran
get
a
regular
job
why
did
i
swear
off
the
whole
business
of
secrecy
and
provocation
i
was
too
smart
for
my
own
good
i
could
always
argue
myself
into
doing
the
sexy
futuristic
thing
instead
of
being
a
nice
mundane
nonaffiliated
individual
too
smart
to
settle
down
take
a
job
and
watch
tv
after
work
spend
two
weeks
a
year
at
the
cottage
and
go
online
to
find
movie
listings
too
smart
is
too
restless
and
no
happiness
ever
without
that
it
chased
by
obsessive
maundering
moping
about
what
comes
next
smart
or
happy
the
hamsters
have
hopped
off
their
wheels
and
are
gnawing
at
the
barrier
trying
to
get
out
of
my
skull
this
is
a
good
sanatorium
but
still
the
toilets
are
communal
on
my
floor
which
means
that
i
got
an
unlocked
door
that
lights
up
at
the
nurses
station
down
the
corridor
when
i
open
the
door
and
goes
berserk
if
i
do
reopen
it
again
within
the
mandated
maximum
i
figured
out
how
to
defeat
the
system
the
first
day
but
it
was
a
theoretical
hack
and
now
it
time
to
put
it
into
practice
i
step
out
the
door
and
the
lintel
goes
pink
deepens
toward
red
once
it
red
whoopwhoopwhoop
i
pad
down
to
the
lav
step
inside
wait
step
out
again
i
go
back
to
my
room
the
lintel
is
orange
now
and
open
it
move
my
torso
across
the
long
electric
eye
then
pull
it
back
and
let
the
door
swing
closed
the
lintel
is
white
and
that
means
that
the
room
thinks
i
inside
but
outside
you
put
your
torso
in
you
take
your
torso
out
you
do
the
and
you
shake
it
all
about
in
the
corridor
i
pad
away
from
the
nurses
station
past
the
closed
doors
and
through
the
muffled
narcotized
groans
and
snores
and
farts
that
are
the
twilight
symphony
of
night
on
the
ward
i
duck
past
an
intersection
head
for
the
elevator
doors
then
remember
the
tattletale
i
wearing
on
my
ankle
which
will
go
spectacularly
berserk
if
i
try
to
leave
by
that
exit
also
i
in
my
underwear
i
ca
just
walk
nonchalantly
into
the
lobby
the
ward
is
making
wakeful
sounds
and
i
sure
i
hear
the
soft
tread
of
a
shoe
coming
round
the
bend
i
double
my
pace
begin
to
jog
at
random
the
hamsters
they
tell
me
i
acting
with
all
the
forethought
of
a
crazy
person
and
why
not
just
report
for
extra
meds
instead
of
all
this
there
definitely
someone
coming
down
a
nearby
corridor
the
tread
of
sneakers
the
squeak
of
a
wheel
i
seen
what
they
do
to
the
wanderers
a
nice
chemical
straightjacket
a
cocktail
of
pills
that
quiet
the
hamsters
down
for
days
time
to
get
gone
there
an
exit
sign
glowing
over
a
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
i
pant
towards
it
find
it
propped
open
and
the
alarm
system
disabled
by
means
of
a
strip
of
surgical
tape
stepping
through
into
the
emergency
stairwell
i
see
an
ashtray
fashioned
from
a
wadded
up
bit
of
tinfoil
heaped
with
butts
evidence
of
smoke
breaks
by
someone
on
the
ward
staff
massachusetts
harsh
antismoking
regs
are
the
best
friend
an
escaping
loony
ever
had
the
stairwell
is
gray
and
industrial
and
refreshingly
after
three
padded
weeks
on
the
ward
down
down
is
the
exit
and
freedom
find
clothes
somewhere
and
out
i
go
into
boston
from
below
then
the
huffing
laborious
breathing
of
some
goddamned
overweight
doc
climbing
the
stairs
for
his
health
i
peer
down
the
well
and
see
his
gleaming
pate
his
white
knuckles
on
the
railing
two
maybe
three
flights
down
up
up
to
the
roof
i
on
the
twentieth
floor
which
means
that
i
got
more
to
go
two
flights
per
fifty
in
total
got
ta
move
up
i
stop
two
or
three
times
and
pant
and
wheeze
and
make
it
ten
stories
and
collapse
sweating
freely
no
in
the
stairwell
nor
is
there
anything
to
mop
up
the
sweat
rolling
down
my
body
filling
the
crack
of
my
ass
coursing
down
my
legs
i
press
my
face
to
the
cool
painted
cinderblock
walls
one
cheek
and
then
the
other
and
continue
on
when
i
finally
open
the
door
that
leads
out
onto
the
pebbled
roof
the
dawn
cool
is
balm
fingers
of
light
are
hauling
the
sunrise
up
over
the
horizon
i
step
onto
the
roof
and
feel
the
pebbles
dig
into
the
soft
soles
of
my
feet
cool
as
the
bottom
of
the
riverbed
whence
they
been
dredged
the
door
starts
to
swing
shut
heavily
behind
me
and
i
whirl
and
catch
it
just
in
time
getting
my
fingers
mashed
against
the
jamb
for
my
trouble
i
haul
it
back
open
again
against
its
pneumatic
closure
mechanism
using
the
side
of
my
foot
as
a
bulldozer
i
scrape
up
a
cairn
of
pebbles
as
high
as
the
door
bottom
edge
twice
as
high
i
fall
into
the
rhythm
of
the
work
making
the
cairn
higher
and
wider
until
i
ca
close
the
door
no
matter
how
i
push
against
it
the
last
thing
i
want
is
to
get
stuck
on
the
goddamn
roof
there
detritus
mixed
in
with
the
pebbles
cigarette
butts
burnt
out
matches
a
condom
wrapper
and
a
bright
yellow
eberhard
pencil
with
a
point
as
sharp
as
a
spear
the
eraser
as
pink
and
softly
resilient
as
a
nipple
i
pick
up
the
pencil
and
twiddle
it
between
forefinger
and
thumb
tap
a
nervous
rattle
against
the
roof
edge
as
i
dangle
my
feet
over
the
bottomless
plummet
until
the
sun
is
high
and
warm
on
my
skin
the
hamsters
get
going
again
once
the
sun
is
high
and
the
cars
start
pulling
into
the
parking
lot
below
rattling
and
chittering
and
whispering
yes
o
yes
put
the
pencil
in
your
nose
would
you
rather
be
happy
than
smart
art
and
linda
in
linda
miniscule
joke
of
a
flat
she
two
months
into
a
with
some
friends
of
friends
who
have
a
walkup
in
kensington
with
a
partial
fictional
view
of
the
park
the
lights
are
on
timers
and
you
need
to
race
them
to
her
flat
door
otherwise
there
no
way
you
fit
the
archaic
key
into
the
battered
keyhole
the
windows
in
the
stairwell
are
so
grimed
as
to
provide
more
of
a
suggestion
of
light
than
light
itself
art
ass
aches
and
he
paces
the
flat
three
wee
rooms
and
drinks
liquid
breakfast
from
the
in
the
efficiency
kitchen
linda
taken
dibs
on
the
first
shower
which
is
fine
by
art
who
ca
get
the
hang
of
the
which
delivers
an
trickle
of
scalding
water
art
has
switched
off
his
comm
his
frazzled
nerves
no
longer
capable
of
coping
with
its
perennial
and
demanding
beeping
and
buzzing
this
is
very
nearly
unthinkable
but
necessary
he
rationalizes
given
the
extraordinary
events
of
the
past
hours
and
fede
can
go
fuck
himself
for
that
matter
that
paranoid
asshole
and
then
he
can
fuck
the
clients
in
jersey
and
the
whole
of
while
he
at
it
the
energy
bev
is
kicking
in
and
making
his
heart
race
and
his
pulse
throb
in
his
throat
and
he
so
unbearably
hyperkinetic
that
he
turns
the
coffee
table
on
its
end
in
the
galley
kitchen
and
clears
a
space
in
the
living
room
barely
big
enough
to
spin
around
in
and
starts
to
work
through
a
slow
slow
set
of
tai
chi
so
slow
that
he
barely
moves
at
all
except
that
inside
he
can
feel
the
moving
can
feel
the
muscles
every
flex
and
groan
as
they
wind
up
release
move
and
swing
and
slide
single
whip
slides
into
crane
opens
wings
and
he
needs
to
crouch
down
low
lower
than
his
woolen
slacks
will
let
him
and
they
grimy
and
gross
anyway
so
he
undoes
his
belt
and
kicks
them
off
down
low
as
white
crane
opens
wings
and
brush
knee
punch
apparent
closure
then
low
again
creakingly
achingly
low
into
wave
hands
like
clouds
until
his
spine
and
his
coccyx
crackle
and
give
springing
open
fascia
open
ribs
open
smooth
breath
rising
and
falling
with
his
diaphragm
smooth
mind
smooth
and
sweat
cool
in
the
mat
of
his
hair
he
moves
through
the
set
and
does
not
notice
linda
until
he
unwinds
into
a
slow
ponderous
lotus
kick
closes
again
breathes
a
moment
and
looks
around
slowly
grinning
like
a
holy
fool
she
in
a
tartan
housecoat
with
a
threadbare
towel
wrapped
around
her
hair
water
beading
on
her
bony
ankles
and
long
skinny
feet
art
art
what
the
hell
was
that
tai
chi
he
says
drawing
a
deep
breath
in
through
his
nostrils
feeling
each
rib
expand
in
turn
exhaling
through
his
mouth
i
do
it
to
unwind
it
was
beautiful
art
art
art
that
was
i
mean
wow
inspiring
something
you
going
to
show
me
how
to
do
that
art
right
you
gon
na
i
could
try
art

i

really
qualified
to
teach
it
i
stopped
going
to
class
ten
years
ago
shut
shut
up
art
you
can
teach
that
damn
you
can
teach
that
i
know
you
can
that
was
wow
she
rushes
forward
and
takes
his
hands
she
squeezes
and
looks
into
his
eyes
she
squeezes
again
and
tugs
his
hands
towards
her
hips
reeling
his
chest
towards
her
breasts
tilting
her
chin
up
and
angling
that
long
jawline
that
so
long
as
to
be
almost
horsey
but
it
is
it
strong
and
clean
art
smells
shampoo
and
sandalwood
talc
and
his
skin
puckers
in
a
crinkle
that
so
sudden
and
massive
that
it
almost
audible
they
been
together
continuously
for
the
past
five
days
almost
without
interruption
and
he
already
conditioned
to
her
smell
and
her
body
language
and
the
subtle
signals
of
her
face
many
mobile
bits
and
pieces
she
is
afire
he
is
afire
their
bodies
are
talking
to
each
other
in
some
secret
language
of
shifting
centers
of
gravity
and
unconscious
pheromones
and
his
face
tilts
down
towards
her
slowly
with
all
the
time
in
the
world
lowers
and
lowers
whiskers
actually
tickling
the
tip
of
her
nose
his
lips
parting
now
and
her
breath
moistens
them
beads
them
with
liquid
condensed
out
of
her
vapor
his
top
lip
touches
her
bottom
lip
he
could
leave
it
at
that
and
be
happy
the
touch
is
so
satisfying
and
he
is
contented
there
for
a
long
moment
then
moves
to
engage
his
lower
lip
moving
tilting
his
comm
rings
his
comm
which
he
has
switched
off
rings
shit
hello
he
says
he
shouts
arthur
says
a
voice
that
is
old
and
hurt
and
melancholy
his
gran
voice
his
gran
who
can
override
his
ringer
switch
on
his
comm
at
a
distance
because
art
is
a
good
grandson
who
was
raised
almost
entirely
by
his
saintly
and
frail
and
depressive
and
melodramatic
and
obsessive
grandmother
and
of
course
his
comm
is
set
to
pass
her
calls
not
because
he
is
a
suck
but
because
he
is
loyal
and
sensitive
and
he
loves
his
gran
gran
hi
sorry
i
was
just
in
the
middle
of
something
sorry
he
checks
his
comm
which
tells
him
that

six
in
the
morning
in
toronto
noon
in
london
and
that
the
date
is
april
and
that
today
is
the
day
that
he
should
have
known
his
grandmother
would
call
you
forgot
she
says
no
accusation
just
a
weary
and
disappointed
sadness
he
has
indeed
forgotten
no
gran
i
did
forget
but
he
did
it
is
the
eighth
of
april
which
means
that
it

he
chances
to
look
up
at
linda
who
is
standing
where
he
left
her
when
he
dived
reflexively
for
his
comm
staring
disbelievingly
at
him
her
robe
is
open
to
her
navel
and
he
sees
the
three
curls
of
pubic
hair
above
the
knot
in
its
belt
that
curl
towards
her
groin
sees
the
hourglass
made
by
the
edges
of
her
breasts
that
are
visible
in
the
vee
of
the
robe
sees
the
edge
of
one
areole
the
left
one
he
is
in
a
tee
shirt
and
bare
feet
and
boxers
crouching
over
his
trousers
talking
to
his
gran
and
he
locks
eyes
with
linda
and
shakes
his
head
apologetically
then
settles
down
to
sit
hunched
over
an
erection

did
know

resolves
to
look
at

bye
gran
bye
he
shakes
his
head
and
holsters
the
comm
back
in
his
pants
then
rocks
back
and
lies
down
on
the
rug
facing
the
ceiling
eyes
closed
a
moment
later
the
hem
of
linda
robe
brushes
his
arm
and
she
lies
down
next
to
him
takes
his
hand
everything
ok
it
just
my
gran
and
he
tells
her
about
this
date
significance
how
did
she
die
it
was
stupid
she
slipped
in
the
tub
and
cracked
her
skull
on
the
tap
i
was
off
at
a
friend
place
for
the
weekend
and
no
one
found
her
for
two
days
she
lived
for
a
week
on
life
support
and
they
pulled
the
plug
no
brain
activity
they
would
let
me
into
the
hospital
room
after
the
first
day
my
gran
practically
moved
in
though
she
raised
me
after
that
i
think
that
if
she
had
had
to
take
care
of
me
she
would
have
just
given
up
you
know
pretty
lonely
back
home
alone
what
about
your
dad
you
know
there
used
to
be
a
big
mystery
about
that
gran
and
mom
they
were
always
tragic
and
secretive
when
i
asked
them
about
him
i
had
lots
of
stories
to
explain
his
absence
ran
off
with
another
woman
thrown
in
jail
for
running
guns
murdered
in
a
bar
fight
i
used
to
be
a
bit
of
a
celeb
at
school
lots
of
kids
did
have
dads
around
but
they
all
knew
where
their
fathers
were
we
could
always
kill
an
afternoon
making
up
his
who
and
where
and
why
even
the
teachers
got
into
it
getting
all
apologetic
when
we
had
to
do
a
genealogy
project
i
found
out
the
truth
finally
when
i
was
nineteen
just
looked
it
up
online
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
my
mom
would
be
that
secretive
about
something
that
was
so
easy
to
find
out
so
i
never
bothered
so
what
happened
to
him
oh
you
know
he
and
mom
split
when
i
was
a
kid
he
moved
back
in
with
his
folks
in
a
little
town
in
the
thousand
islands
near
ottawa
four
or
five
years
later
he
got
a
job
planting
trees
for
a
summer
up
north
and
he
drowned
swimming
in
a
lake
during
a
party
by
the
time
i
found
out
about
him
his
folks
were
dead
too
did
you
tell
your
friends
about
him
once
you
found
out
oh
by
then
i
lost
touch
with
most
of
them
after
elementary
school
we
moved
across
town
to
a
condo
my
grandmother
retired
into
on
the
lakeshore
out
in
the
suburbs
in
high
school
i
did
really
chum
around
much
so
there
anyone
to
talk
to
i
did
tell
my
gran
though
asked
her
why
it
was
such
a
big
secret
and
she
said
it
was
she
said
she
told
me
years
before
but
she
had
i
think
that
she
and
mom
just
decided
to
wait
until
i
was
older
before
telling
me
and
then
after
my
mom
died
she
just
forgot
that
she
had
told
me
we
got
into
a
big
fight
over
that
that
a
weird
story
dude
so
do
you
think
of
yourself
as
an
orphan
art
rolls
over
on
his
side
face
inches
from
hers
and
snorts
a
laugh
god
that
so
no
one
ever
asked
me
that
before
i
do
think
so
you
ca
really
be
an
adult
and
be
an
orphan
you
just
someone
with
dead
parents
and
i
did
find
out
about
my
dad
until
i
was
older
so
i
always
figured
that
he
was
alive
and
well
somewhere
what
about
your
folks
linda
rolls
over
on
her
side
too
her
robe
slipping
off
her
lower
breast
art
is
aroused
by
it
but
not
crazily
so
somewhere
in
telling
his
story
figured
out
that
sex
is
a
foregone
conclusion
and
now
they
just
getting
through
some
nice
foreplay
he
smiles
down
at
her
nipple
which
is
brown
as
a
bar
of
belgian
chocolate
aureole
the
size
of
a
round
of
individual
cheese
and
nipple
itself
a
surprisingly
chunky
square
of
crinkled
flesh
she
follows
his
eyes
and
smiles
at
him
then
puts
his
hand
over
her
breast
covers
it
with
hers
i
told
you
about
my
mom
right
wanted
to
act
who
does
but
she
was
too
conscious
of
the
cliche
to
mope
about
it
she
got
some
little
parts
nothing
fab
then
went
on
to
work
at
a
sony
dealership
ten
years
later
she
bought
a
franchise
dad
and
run
a
retreat
in
west
hollywood
for
sexually
dysfunctional
couples
no
sibs
happy
childhood
happy
adolescence
largely
unsatisfying
adulthood
to
date
wow
you
sound
like
you
practiced
that
she
tweaks
his
nose
then
drapes
her
arm
across
his
chest
got
me
always
writing
my
autobiography
in
my
head
got
ta
have
a
snappy
opener
when
cornered
by
the
stalkerazzi
he
laces
his
fingers
in
hers
moves
close
enough
to
smell
her
breath
tell
me
something
unrehearsed
about
growing
up
that
a
stupid
request
her
tone
is
snappish
and
her
fingers
stiffen
in
his
why
it
just
is
do
try
to
get
under
my
skin
ok
my
childhood
was
fine
look
i
do
want
to
piss
you
off
i
just
trying
to
get
to
know
you
because
you
know
i
like
you
a
lot
and
i
try
to
get
to
know
the
people
i
like
she
smiles
her
lopsided
dimple
sorry
i
just
do
like
people
who
try
to
mess
with
my
head
my
problem
not
yours
ok
something
unrehearsed
she
closes
her
eyes
and
treats
him
to
the
smooth
pinkness
of
her
eyelids
and
keeps
them
closed
as
she
speaks
i
once
stole
a
veddic
series
off
my
mom
lot
when
i
was
fifteen
it
had
all
the
girly
safety
features
including
a
tracker
and
a
panic
button
but
i
did
think
my
mom
would
miss
it
i
just
wanted
to
take
it
out
for
a
drive
it
la
right
no
wheels
no
life
so
i
get
as
far
as
venice
beach
and
i
cruising
the
boardwalk
this
was
just
after
it
went
topless
so
i
was
swinging
in
the
breeze
and
suddenly
the
engine
dies
right
in
the
middle
of
this
clump
of
frat
kids
from
kansas
or
something
mom
had
called
in
a
dealer
override
and
sony
shut
down
the
engine
by
radio
wow
what
did
you
do
well
i
put
my
shirt
back
on
then
i
popped
the
hood
and
poked
randomly
at
the
engine
pulling
out
the
and
reseating
them
the
thing
was
newer
than
new
right
how
could
it
be
broken
already
the
fratboys
all
gathered
around
and
gave
me
advice
and
i
played
up
all
bitchy
you
know
been
fixing
these
things
since
i
was
ten
get
lost
whatever
they
loved
it
i
was
all
spunky
a
couple
of
them
were
pretty
cute
even
and
the
attention
was
great
i
felt
safe
lots
of
people
hanging
around
they
were
going
to
try
anything
funny
only
i
was
starting
to
freak
out
about
the
car
it
was
really
dead
reseated
everything
every
component
the
fuel
nothing
nothing
nothing
i
was
going
to
have
to
call
a
tow
and
my
mom
was
going
to
kill
me
so
i
trying
not
to
let
it
get
to
me
trying
to
keep
it
all
cool
but
i
not
doing
a
great
job
the
frat
guys
are
all
standing
too
close
and
they
smell
like
beer
and
i
not
trying
to
be
perky
anymore
just
want
them
to
stay
away
but
they
wo
back
off
i
trying
not
to
cry
and
then
the
cops
showed
up
not
real
cops
but
sony
vehicle
recovery
squad
all
dressed
up
in
vaio
gear
stylish
as
a
pepsi
ad
packing
lots
of
semilethals
and
silvery
aeorosol
juice
ready
to
nab
the
bad
bad
perp
who
boosted
this
lovely
veddic
series
from
mom
lot
part
of
the
franchise
package
that
kind
of
response
it
took
me
a
second
to
figure
it
out
mom
did
know
it
was
who
had
the
car
so
she
called
in
a
theft
and
bam
i
was
about
to
get
arrested
the
frat
rats
tried
to
run
away
which
is
a
bad
idea
you
just
do
ever
run
from
cops
stupid
stupid
stupid
they
ended
up
rolling
around
on
the
ground
screaming
and
trying
to
pull
their
faces
off
it
took
like
a
second
i
threw
my
hands
in
the
air
shoot
they
gassed
me
anyway
so
then
was
rolling
around
on
the
ground
feeling
like
my
sinuses
were
trying
to
explode
out
of
my
face
feeling
like
my
eyeballs
were
melting
feeling
like
my
lungs
were
all
shriveled
up
into
raisins
i
could
scream
i
even
breathe
by
the
time
i
could
even
roll
over
and
open
my
eyes
they
had
me
cuffed
ankles
and
wrists
in
zapstraps
that
were
so
tight
they
felt
like
piano
wire
i
was
a
cool
fifteen
year
old
but
not
that
cool
i
started
up
the
waterworks
boohoohoo
could
shut
it
down
could
even
get
angry
i
just
wanted
to
die
the
sony
cops
had
seen
it
all
before
so
they
put
a
tarp
down
on
the
veddic
backseat
upholstery
threw
me
in
it
then
rolled
it
into
their
recovery
truck
and
drove
me
to
the
police
station
i
puked
on
the
tarp
twice
before
they
got
me
there
and
almost
did
it
a
third
time
on
the
way
to
booking
it
got
up
my
sinuses
and
down
my
throat
too
i
could
stop
gagging
could
stop
crying
but
by
now
i
was
getting
pissed
i
been
raised
on
the
whole
sony
message
car
for
the
rest
of
us
gone
with
mom
to
their
empowerment
seminars
wore
the
little
tee
shirts
and
the
temporary
tats
and
chatted
up
the
about
the
sony
family
while
mom
was
busy
this
was
the
sony
family
i
knew
i
was
tied
up
on
the
floor
beside
the
desk
sergeant
counter
and
a
sony
cop
was
filling
in
my
paperwork
and
so
i
spat
out
the
crud
from
my
mouth
stopped
sniveling
hawked
back
my
spit
and
put
on
my
best
voice
is
necessary
sir

said

a
thief

mother
owns
the
dealership
it
was
wrong
to
take
the
car

she
did
intend
for
this
to
happen
certainly
i
do
need
to
be
tied
up
in
here
please
take
off
the
restraints
cutting
off
my
circulation
the
sony
cop
flipped
up
his
goofy
little
facemask
and
squinted
at
me
then
shook
his
head
and
went
back
to
his
paperwork
i
said
i
not
a
criminal
this
is
a
misunderstanding
if
you
check
my
id
and

my
mother

out
look
i
read
his
name
off
his
epaulettes
officer

me
up
and
we
sort
this
out
like

right
to
take
me
in
this
is
my
mom
merchandise

good
that

went
after
the
thief
and
recovered
the
car
but
now

me
up

officer
langtree

wallet
in
my
back
pocket
just
get
it
out
and
check
my
id
before
you
do
this
but
he
just
went
on
filling
in
the
paperwork
why
wo
you
just
take
a
second
to
check
why
not
he
turned
around
again
looked
at
me
for
a
long
time
and
i
was
sure
he
was
going
to
check
that
it
was
all
going
to
be
fine
but
then
he
said
had
about
as
much
of
your
bullshit
as
i
going
to
take
little
girl
shut
your
hole
or
i
gag
you
i
just
want
to
get
out
of
here
and
back
to
my
job
all
right
i
said
and
it
sounded
like
a
shriek
to
me
did
you
say
to
me
what
the
hell
did
you
say
to
me
did
you
hear
what
i
said
that
my
she
owns
the
lot
i
took
it
off
of
do
you
honestly
think
she
wants
you
to
do
this
this
is
the
stupidest
goddamned
thing
it
he
said
and
took
a
little
silver
micropore
hood
off
his
belt
the
kind
that
you
cinch
up
under
the
chin
so
the
person
inside
ca
talk
i
started
squirming
away
then
pleading
with
him
and
i
finally
caught
the
desk
eye
ca
do
this
please
do
let
him
do
this
i
in
a
why
are
you
letting
him
do
this
and
the
cop
smiled
and
said
absolutely
right
little
girl
enough
of
that
the
sony
cop
did
pay
any
attention
he
grabbed
my
head
and
stuffed
it
into
the
hood
and
tried
to
get
the
chin
strap
in
place
i
shook
my
head
as
best
as
i
could
and
then
the
hood
was
being
taken
off
my
head
again
and
the
sony
cop
looked
like
he
wanted
to
nail
the
other
cop
but
he
did
the
desk
sergeant
bent
down
and
cut
my
straps
then
helped
me
to
my
feet
not
going
to
give
me
any
trouble
are
you
he
said
as
he
led
me
around
to
a
nice
ergo
office
chair
sir
just
sit
there
then
and
i
be
with
you
in
a
moment
i
sat
down
and
rubbed
my
wrists
and
ankles
my
left
ankle
was
oozing
blood
from
where
it
had
been
rubbed
raw
i
could
believe
that
the
sony
family
could
inflict
such
indignities
on
my
cute
little
person
i
was
so
goddamn
and
i
know
i
was
smirking
as
the
desk
sergeant
chewed
out
the
sony
cop
taking
down
his
badge
number
and
so
on
so
that
i
have
it
i
thanked
the
cop
profusely
and
i
kept
on
thanking
him
as
he
booked
me
and
printed
me
and
took
my
mug
shots
i
was
joking
and
maybe
even
flirting
a
little
i
was
a
cute
and
i
knew
it
after
the
nastiness
with
the
sony
cops
being
processed
into
the
criminal
justice
system
seemed
mild
and
inoffensive
it
did
really
occur
to
me
that
i
was
being
until
my
good
pal
the
cop
asked
me
to
turn
out
my
pockets
before
he
put
me
in
the
cell
i
said
lorenzi
wait
you
do
have
to
put
me
in
a
do

sergeant
lorenzi
sergeant
lorenzi
i
do
need
to

into
a
cell

me
call

mom

down
and
drop
the
charges
and
i
can
wait
here

can
get
coffee
sergeant
lorenzi
for
a
second
it
looked
like
he
was
going
to
go
through
with
it
then
he
relented
and
i
spent
the
next
couple
hours
fetching
and
filing
and
even
running
out
for
coffee
that
how
much
he
trusted
me
while
we
waited
for
mom
to
show
up
i
was
actually
feeling
pretty
good
about
it
by
the
time
she
arrived
of
course
that
did
last
too
long
she
came
through
the
door
like
yosemite
sam
frothing
at
the
chops
and
howling
for
my
blood
she
wanted
to
press
charges
see
me
locked
up
to
teach
me
a
lesson
she
did
care
how
the
sony
cops
had
gassed
and
trussed
me
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
i
betrayed
her
and
nothing
was
going
to
make
it
right
she
kept
howling
for
the
sergeant
to
give
her
the
papers
to
sign
she
wanted
to
swear
out
a
complaint
and
he
just
let
her
run
out
of
steam
his
face
perfectly
expressionless
until
she
was
done
right
then
walchuk
all
right
you
swear
out
the
complaint
and
we
hold
her
overnight
until
her
bail
hearing
we
only
got
the
one
holding
cell
though
you
understand
no
juvenile
facility
rough
crowd
a
couple
of
biowar
enthusiasts
in
there
right
now
caught
trying
to
thrax
a
bus
terminal
a
girl
who
killed
her
pimp
and
nailed
his
privates
to
the
door
of
his
hotel
room
before
she
took
off
a
couple
of
hard
old
drunks
no
telling
what
else
will
come
in
today
we
take
away
their
knives
and
boots
and
purses
but
those
girls
like
to
mess
up
fresh
young
things
scar
them
with
the
bars
or
their
nails
we
ca
watch
them
all
the
time
he
was
leaning
right
across
the
desk
at
my
mom
cold
and
still
and
then
he
nudged
my
foot
with
his
foot
and
i
knew
that
he
was
yanking
her
chain
that
what
you
want
then
mom
looked
like
she
wanted
to
tell
him
yes
go
ahead
call
his
bluff
but
he
was
too
good
at
it
she
broke
it
not
she
said

her
home
and
deal
with
her
there
fundamentally
sound
he
said
linda

me
a
call
if
you
want
to
file
a
complaint

secam
footage
of

looked
alarmed
and
i
held
out
my
raw
bruisey

me
before
they
took
me
in
you
run

from
the
cops

the
air
and
they
gassed
me
and
tied
me
up
and
took
me
in
ca
be
linda

must
have
done
mom
always
was
ready
to
believe
that
i
deserved
whatever
trouble
i
got
into
she
was
the
only
one
who
did
care
how
cute
i
was
mom

put
my
hands
in
the
air
i
surrendered

the
tape

it
from
sergeant
lorenzi
when
i
file
my
complaint
do
no
such
thing
you
stole
a
car
you
endangered
lives
and
now
you
want
to
go
sniveling
to
the
authorities
because
sony
played
a
little
rough
when
they
brought
you
in
you
committed
a
linda
you
got
treated
like
a
criminal
i
wanted
to
smack
her
i
knew
that
this
was
really
about
not
embarrassing
her
in
front
of
the
sony
family
the
nosy
chattery
ladies
with
the
other
franchises
that
mom
competed
against
for
whuffie
and
bragging
rights
but
i
learned
something
about
drawing
flies
with
honey
that
afternoon
the
sergeant
could
have
made
things
very
hard
on
me
but
by
giving
him
a
little
sugar
i
turned
it
into
an
almost
fun
afternoon
mom
took
me
home
and
screamed
herself
raw
and
i
played
it
all
very
contrite
then
walked
over
to
the
minimall
so
that
i
could
buy
some
saline
solution
for
my
eyes
which
were
still
as
red
as
stoplights
we
never
spoke
of
it
again
and
on
my
sixteenth
birthday
mom
gave
me
the
keys
to
a
veddic
series
and
the
first
thing
i
did
was
download
new
firmware
for
the
antitheft
transponder
that
killed
it
two
months
later
it
was
stolen
i
have
driven
a
sony
since
linda
smiles
and
then
purses
her
lips
unrehearsed
enough
art
shakes
his
head
wow

a
story

want
to
kiss
me
now
linda
says
conversationally
i
believe

he
does
linda
pulls
the
back
of
his
head
to
hers
with
one
arm
and
with
the
other
she
out
of
her
robe
art
pulls
his
shirt
up
to
his
armpits
feels
the
scorching
softness
of
her
chest
on
his
and
groans
his
erection
grinds
into
her
mons
through
his
jockey
shorts
and
he
groans
again
as
she
sucks
his
tongue
into
her
mouth
and
masticates
it
just
shy
of
hard
enough
to
hurt
she
breaks
off
and
reaches
down
for
the
waistband
of
his
jockeys
and
his
whole
body
arches
in
anticipation
then
his
comm
rings
again
fuck
art
says
just
as
linda
says
shit
and
they
both
snort
a
laugh
linda
pulls
his
hand
to
her
nipple
again
and
art
shivers
sighs
and
reaches
for
his
comm
which
wo
stop
ringing

his
mouth

once
they
out
he
decides
to
go
with
them
you
can
indulge
your
paranoid
fantasies
to
your
heart
content
but
do

fede
art
rings
the
comm
off
and
snarls
at
it
then
switches
it
off
switches
off
the
emergency
override
and
briefly
considers
tossing
it
out
the
goddamned
window
onto
the
precious
english
paving
stones
below
instead
he
hurls
it
into
the
soft
cushions
of
the
sofa
he
turns
back
to
linda
and
makes
a
conscious
effort
to
wipe
the
snarl
off
his
face
he
ratchets
a
smile
onto
his
lips
sorry
sorry
last
time
i
swear
he
crawls
over
to
her
on
all
fours
she
pulled
her
robe
tight
around
her
and
he
slides
a
finger
under
the
collar
and
slides
it
aside
and
darts
in
for
a
kiss
on
the
hollow
of
her
collarbone
she
shies
away
and
drops
her
cheek
to
her
shoulder
shielding
the
affected
area
i
not
she
starts
the
moment
passed
ok
why
do
we
just
cuddle
ok
art
was
at
his
desk
at
house
the
next
day
when
fede
knocked
on
his
door
fede
was
bearing
a
small
translucent
made
of
some
cunning
combination
of
rough
handmade
paper
and
slick
polymer
art
looked
up
from
his
comm
and
waved
at
the
door
fede
came
in
and
put
the
parcel
on
art
desk
art
looked
askance
at
fede
and
fede
just
waved
at
the
bag
with
a
gesture
art
felt
for
the
catch
that
would
open
the
bag
without
tearing
the
materials
could
find
it
immediately
and
reflexively
fired
up
his
comm
and
started
to
make
notes
on
how
a
revised
version
of
the
bag
could
provide
visual
cues
showing
how
to
open
it
fede
caught
him
at
it
and
they
traded
grins
art
probed
the
bag
orifice
a
while
longer
then
happened
upon
the
release
the
bag
sighed
apart
falling
in
three
petals
and
revealed
its
payload
a
small
box
with
a
simple
brass
catch
art
flipped
the
catch
and
eased
the
box
open
inside
in
a
fitted
foam
cavity
was
a
gray
lump
of
stone
it
an
fede
said
it
years
old
art
lifted
it
out
of
the
box
carefully
and
turned
it
about
admiring
the
clean
tool
marks
from
its
shaping
it
had
heft
and
brutal
simplicity
and
a
thin
spot
where
a
handle
must
have
been
lashed
once
upon
a
time
art
ran
his
fingertips
over
the
smooth
tool
marks
over
the
tapered
business
end
where
the
stone
had
been
painstakingly
flaked
into
an
edge
it
was
perfect
now
that
he
was
holding
it
it
was
so
obviously
an
axe
so
clearly
an
axe
it
needed
no
instruction
it
explained
itself
i
am
an
axe
hit
things
with
me
art
could
think
of
a
single
means
by
which
it
could
be
improved
fede
he
said
fede
this
is
incredible
i
figured
we
needed
to
bury
the
hatchet
huh
god
that
awful
here
a
tip
when
you
give
a
gift
like
this
just
leave
humor
out
of
it
ok
you
do
have
the
knack
art
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
to
show
him
he
was
kidding
and
reverently
returned
the
axe
to
its
cavity
that
is
really
one
hell
of
a
gift
fede
thank
you
fede
stuck
his
hand
out
art
shook
it
and
some
of
the
week
tension
melted
away
now
you
going
to
buy
me
lunch
fede
said
deal
they
toddled
off
to
picadilly
and
grabbed
seats
at
the
counter
of
a
south
indian
place
for
a
businessmen
lunch
of
thali
and
thick
mango
lassi
which
coated
their
tongues
in
alkaline
sweetness
that
put
out
the
flames
from
the
spiced
veggies
both
men
were
sweating
by
the
time
they
ordered
their
second
round
of
lassi
and
art
had
his
hands
on
his
belly
amazed
as
ever
that
something
as
insubstantial
as
the
little
platter
complement
of
veggies
and
naan
could
fill
him
as
efficiently
as
it
had
what
are
you
working
on
now
fede
asked
suppressing
a
belch
same
shit
art
said
there
are
a
million
ways
to
make
the
service
work
the
want
lots
of
accounting
and
lots
of
masspike
hates
that
it
a
pain
in
the
ass
to
manage
and
the
clickthrough
licenses
and
warnings
they
want
to
slap
on
are
heinous
people
are
going
to
crash
their
cars
fucking
around
with
the
agree
buttons
not
to
mention
they
want
to
require
a
firmware
check
on
every
stereo
system
that
gets
a
song
make
sure
that
this
week
is
installed
so
i
coopering
up
all
these
user
studies
with
weasels
from
the
legal
departments
at
the
studios
where
they
just
slaver
all
over
this
stuff
talking
about
how
warm
it
all
makes
them
feel
to
make
sure
that
they
compensating
artists
and
how
grateful
they
are
for
the
reminders
to
keep
their
software
up
to
date
and
shit
i
modeling
a
system
that
has
a
clickthrough
every
time
you
cue
up
a
new
song
too
it
going
to
be
perfect
the
are
going
to
love
it
and
i
handpicked
the
peer
review
group
at
stacked
it
up
with
total
assholes
who
love
manuals
and
following
rules
it
going
to
sail
through
approval
fede
grunted
you
do
think
it
be
too
obvious
art
laughed
there
is
no
such
thing
as
too
obvious
in
this
context
man
these
guys
they
hate
the
end
user
and
for
years
they
been
getting
away
with
it
because
all
their
users
are
already
used
to
being
treated
like
shit
at
the
post
office
and
the
tube
station
i
mean
these
people
grew
up
with
for
chrissakes
they
pay
television
tax
feed
shit
and
they
ask
you
for
second
helpings
beg
you
for
so
no
i
do
think
it
be
too
obvious
they
mock
up
the
whole
system
and
march
right
into
masspike
with
it
grinning
like
idiots
do
worry
about
a
thing
ok
ok
i
get
it
i
wo
worry
art
signalled
the
counterman
for
their
bill
the
counterman
waved
distractedly
in
the
manner
of
a
harried
restaurateur
dealing
with
his
regulars
and
said
something
in
korean
to
the
busgirl
who
along
with
the
vietnamese
chef
and
the
congolese
sous
chef
lent
the
joint
a
transworld
sensibility
that
made
it
a
favorite
among
the
painfully
global
darlings
of
house
the
found
a
pad
and
started
totting
up
numbers
then
keyed
them
into
a
terminal
which
juiced
art
comm
with
an
accounting
for
their
lunch
this
business
with
everything
before
entering
it
into
the
pos
had
driven
art
to
distraction
when
he
first
encountered
it
he
assumed
that
the
terminal
ui
was
such
that
a
busgirl
could
reliably
key
in
the
data
without
having
it
in
front
of
her
and
for
months
he
cited
it
in
sessions
as
more
evidence
of
the
pervasive
that
characterized
the
whole
damned
gmt
he
finally
tried
out
his
rant
on
the
counterman
one
foreigner
to
another
just
a
little
session
between
two
refugees
from
the
colonial
jackboot
to
his
everlasting
surprise
the
counterman
had
vigorously
defended
the
system
saying
that
he
liked
the
pos
system
just
fine
but
that
the
stack
of
paper
stubs
from
the
busgirl
receipt
book
was
a
good
visualization
tool
letting
him
eyeball
the
customer
volume
from
hour
to
hour
by
checking
the
spike
beside
the
till
and
the
rubberbanded
stacks
of
yellowing
paper
lining
his
cellar
shelves
gave
him
a
wonderfully
physical
evidence
of
the
growing
success
of
his
little
eatery
there
was
a
lesson
there
art
knew
though
he
yet
to
codify
it
user
mythology
was
tricky
that
way
every
time
art
scribbled
a
tip
into
his
comm
and
squirted
it
back
at
the
pos
he
considered
this
little
puzzle
eyes
unfocusing
for
a
moment
while
his
vision
turned
inwards
as
his
eyes
snapped
back
into
focus
he
noticed
the
young
lad
sitting
on
the
long
leg
of
the
ell
formed
by
the
counter
he
had
bully
short
hair
and
broad
shoulders
and
a
sneer
that
did
quite
disappear
as
he
shoveled
up
the
dhal
with
his
biodegradable
bamboo
disposable
spork
he
knew
that
guy
from
somewhere
the
guy
caught
him
staring
and
they
locked
eyes
for
a
moment
and
in
that
instant
art
knew
who
the
guy
was
it
was
tom
whom
he
had
last
seen
stabbing
at
him
with
a
tazer
clutched
in
one
shaking
fist
face
twisted
in
fury
tom
was
wearing
his
killsport
armor
just
nondescript
athletic
wear
and
he
was
with
lester
and
tony
but
it
was
him
art
watched
tom
cock
his
head
to
jog
his
memory
and
then
saw
tom
recognize
him
we
have
to
go
now
he
said
to
fede
standing
and
walking
away
quickly
hand
going
to
his
comm
he
stopped
short
of
dialing
though
he
was
up
for
another
he
got
halfway
up
picadilly
before
looking
over
his
shoulder
and
he
saw
fede
shouldering
his
way
through
the
lunchtime
crowd
looking
pissed
a
few
paces
behind
him
came
tom
face
contorted
in
a
sadistic
snarl
art
did
a
little
of
indecision
moving
towards
fede
then
away
from
him
he
met
tom
eyes
again
and
tom
ferocious
bared
teeth
spurred
him
on
he
turned
abruptly
into
the
tube
station
waved
his
comm
at
a
turnstile
and
dove
into
the
thick
of
the
crowd
heading
down
the
stairs
to
the
elephant
and
castle
platform
his
comm
rang
what
is
with
you
man
fede
said
one
of
the
guys
who
mugged
me
he
hissed
he

sitting

behind

grainy
feed
from

as

through
the
crowd

that
guy
and
not
have
him
find
me
again
later
christ
art
squeaked
as
tom
filled
his
screen
then
passed
by
swinging
his
head
from
side
to
side
with
saurian
rage
what
fede
said
that
was
him
he
just
walked
past
you
he
must
not
know
you
with
me
go
back
to
the
office
i
meet
you
there
that
dipshit
art
he
all
of
five
feet
tall
he
a
fucking
psycho
fede
do
screw
around
with
him
or
he
give
you
a
tesla
enema
fede
winced
i
hate
tazers
the
train
is
pulling
in
i
talk
to
you
later
ok
art
formed
up
in
queue
with
the
rest
of
the
passengers
and
shuffled
through
the
gas
chromatograph
tensing
up
a
little
as
it
sniffed
his
personal
space
for
black
powder
residue
once
on
board
he
tore
a
from
the
roll
in
the
ceiling
ignoring
the
ad
on
it
and
grabbed
the
stainless
steel
rail
with
it
stamping
on
the
drifts
of
mulch
on
the
train
floor
he
made
a
conscious
effort
to
control
his
breathing
willed
his
heart
to
stop
pounding
he
was
still
juiced
with
adrenaline
and
his
mind
raced
he
needed
to
do
something
constructive
with
his
time
but
his
mind
kept
wandering
finally
he
gave
in
and
let
it
wander
something
about
the
counterman
about
his
slips
of
paper
about
the
masspike
it
was
knocking
around
in
his
brain
and
he
just
could
figure
out
how
to
bring
it
to
the
fore
the
counterman
kept
his
slips
in
the
basement
so
that
he
could
sit
among
them
and
see
how
his
business
had
grown
every
slip
a
person
served
a
ring
on
the
till
money
in
the
bank
drivers
on
the
masspike
who
used
traffic
jams
to
download
music
from
nearby
cars
and
then
paid
to
license
the
songs
only
they
did
they
circumvented
the
payment
system
in
droves
running
bootleg
operations
out
of
their
cars
that
put
poor
old
napster
to
shame
for
sheer
volume
some
people
drove
in
promiscuous
mode
collecting
every
song
in
every
car
on
the
turnpike
cruising
the
tunnels
that
riddled
boston
like
mobile
pirate
radio
stations
dumping
their
collections
to
other
drivers
when
it
came
time
to
quit
the
turnpike
and
settle
up
for
their
music
at
the
toll
booth
it
was
these
that
masspike
was
really
worried
about
admittedly
they
actually
made
the
system
go
your
average
fartmobile
driver
had
all
of
ten
songs
in
his
queue
and
the
broadband
connection
you
had
on
masspike
meant
that
if
you
were
stuck
in
a
jam
of
these
cars
your
selection
would
be
severely
limited
the
though
were
mobile
jukeboxes
the
highway
patrol
had
actually
seized
cars
with
over
tracks
on
their
drives
without
these
fat
caches
on
the
highway
masspike
would
have
to
spend
a
fortune
on
essentially
replicating
the
system
with
their
own
mobile
libraries
the
were
the
collective
memory
of
the
masspike
ooh
there
was
a
tasty
idea
the
collective
memory
of
masspike
like
dark
ages
scholars
memorizing
entire
texts
to
preserve
them
against
the
depredations
of
barbarism
passing
their
collections
carefully
from
car
to
car
investigated
the
highway
patrol
reports
on
these
guys
and
there
were
hints
there
shadowy
clues
of
an
organized
subculture
one
with
a
hierarchy
where
newbies
tricked
out
their
storage
with
libraries
of
novel
and
rare
tuneage
in
a
bid
to
convince
the
established
elite
that
they
were
worthy
of
joining
the
collective
memory
thinking
of
as
a
collective
memory
was
like
staring
at
an
optical
illusion
and
seeing
the
vase
emerge
from
the
two
faces
art
entire
perception
of
the
problem
involuted
itself
in
his
mind
he
heard
panting
and
realized
it
was
him
he
was
hyperventilating
if
these
guys
were
the
collective
memory
of
the
masspike
that
meant
that
they
were
performing
a
service
reducing
masspike
costs
significantly
that
meant
that
they
were
tastemakers
injecting
fresh
music
into
the
static
world
of
boston
drivers
mmmm
trace
that
find
out
how
influential
they
were
someone
would
know
the
masspike
had
stats
on
how
songs
migrated
from
car
to
car
even
without
investigating
it
art
just
that
these
guys
were
offsetting
millions
of
dollars
in
marketing
so
so
so
so
that
culture
needed
to
be
devoted
to
make
it
into
the
subculture
they
had
to
spend
four
or
five
hours
a
day
cruising
the
freeways
to
accumulate
and
propagate
their
collections
they
could
the
masspike
until
they
found
someone
to
hand
their
collections
off
to
what
if
masspike
these
guys
what
if
masspike
charged
for
people
with
more
than
say
tunes
in
their
cache
art
whipped
out
his
comm
and
his
keyboard
and
started
making
notes
snatching
at
the
silver
rail
with
his
keyboard
hand
every
time
the
train
jerked
and
threatened
to
topple
him
how
the
tube
cops
found
him
once
the
train
reached
elephant
and
castle
and
they
did
their
rounds
politely
but
firmly
rousting
him
i
am
already
in
as
much
trouble
as
i
can
be
i
think
i
have
left
my
room
hit
and
detonated
some
poor
cafeteria
fartmobile
and
certainly
damned
some
hapless
secret
smoker
to
employee
hades
for
his
security
lapses
when
i
get
down
from
here
i
will
be
bound
up
in
a
chemical
straightjacket
be
one
of
the
droolers
propped
up
in
a
wheelchair
in
front
of
the
video
tended
twice
daily
for
diaper
changes
feeding
and
that
is
the
worst
they
can
do
and
i
in
for
it
this
leaves
me
asking
two
questions
why
am
i
so
damned
eager
to
be
rescued
from
my
rooftop
aerie
i
am
sunburned
and
sad
but
i
am
more
free
than
i
have
been
in
weeks
why
am
i
so
reluctant
to
take
further
action
in
the
service
of
getting
someone
up
onto
the
roof
i
could
topple
a
ventilator
chimney
by
moving
the
cinderblocks
that
hold
its
apron
down
and
giving
it
the
shoulder
i
could
dump
rattling
handfuls
of
gravel
down
its
maw
and
wake
the
psychotics
below
i
could
but
i
wo
maybe
i
do
want
to
go
back
just
yet
they
cooked
it
up
between
them
the
jersey
customers
fede
and
linda
i
should
have
known
better
when
i
landed
at
logan
i
was
full
of
beans
ready
to
design
and
implement
my
scheme
for
the
jersey
customers
and
advance
the
glorious
cause
of
the
eastern
standard
tribe
i
gleefully
hopped
up
and
down
the
coast
chilling
in
manhattan
for
a
day
or
two
hanging
out
with
gran
in
toronto
that
linda
followed
me
out
made
it
all
even
better
we
rented
cars
and
drove
them
from
city
to
city
dropping
them
off
at
the
city
limits
and
switching
to
est
public
transit
eating
est
pizza
heads
turning
to
follow
the
impeccably
dressed
buff
couples
that
strolled
the
streets
arm
in
arm
we
sat
on
stoops
in
brooklyn
with
old
ladies
who
talked
softly
in
the
gloaming
of
the
sunsets
while
their
grandchildren
chased
each
other
down
the
street
we
joined
a
pickup
game
of
in
boston
yelling
car
and
clearing
the
net
every
time
a
fartmobile
turned
into
the
we
played
like
kids
i
got
commed
during
working
hours
and
my
evenings
were
blissfully
devoid
of
buzzes
beeps
and
alerts
it
surprised
the
hell
out
of
me
when
i
discovered
fede
treachery
and
linda
complicity
and
found
myself
flying
cattle
class
to
london
to
kick
fede
ass
what
an
idiot
i
am
i
have
never
won
an
argument
with
fede
i
thought
i
had
that
time
of
course
but
i
should
have
known
better
i
was
hardly
back
in
boston
for
a
day
before
the
men
with
the
white
coats
came
to
take
me
away
they
showed
up
at
the
novotel
soothing
and
grim
and
opened
my
room
keycard
reader
with
a
override
there
were
four
of
them
wiry
and
fast
with
the
manner
of
men
who
have
been
unexpectedly
hammered
by
outwardly
calm
psychopaths
that
i
was
harmlessly
having
a
rare
cigarette
on
the
balcony
dripping
from
the
shower
made
no
impression
on
them
they
dropped
their
faceplates
moved
quickly
to
the
balcony
and
boxed
me
in
one
of
them
recited
a
litany
that
ended
with
do
you
understand
it
was
really
a
question
but
i
answered
anyway
no
no
i
do
who
the
hell
are
you
and
what
are
you
doing
in
my
fucking
hotel
room
in
my
heart
though
i
knew
i
lived
enough
of
my
life
on
the
hallucinatory
edge
of
sleepdep
to
have
anticipated
this
moment
during
a
thousand
freakouts
i
was
being
led
away
to
the
sanatorium
because
someone
somewhere
had
figured
out
about
the
scurrying
hamsters
in
my
brain
about
time
as
soon
as
i
said
the
the
guns
came
out
i
tried
to
relax
i
knew
intuitively
that
this
could
either
be
a
routine
and
impersonal
affair
or
a
screaming
kicking
biting
nightmare
i
knew
that
arriving
at
the
intake
in
a
calm
frame
of
mind
would
make
the
difference
between
a
chemical
straightjacket
and
a
sleeping
pill
the
guns
were
nonlethals
and
varied
two
kinds
of
nasty
aerosol
a
and
a
tazer
the
tazer
captured
my
attention
whipping
horizontal
lightning
in
the
spring
breeze
the
tesla
enema
they
called
it
in
london
supposedly
used
them
recreationally
but
everyone
i
knew
who
been
hit
with
one
described
the
experience
as
fundamentally
and
uniquely
horrible
i
slowly
raised
my
hands
i
would
like
to
pack
a
bag
and
i
would
like
to
see
documentary
evidence
of
your
authority
may
i
i
kept
my
voice
as
calm
as
i
could
but
it
cracked
on
may
i
the
reader
of
the
litany
nodded
slowly
you
tell
us
what
you
want
packed
and
we
pack
it
once
that
done
i
show
you
the
committal
document
all
right
thank
you
i
said
they
drove
me
through
the
route
traffic
in
the
sealed
and
padded
compartment
in
the
back
of
their
van
i
was
strapped
in
at
the
waist
and
strapped
over
my
shoulders
with
a
padded
harness
that
reminded
me
of
a
rollercoaster
restraint
we
made
slow
progress
jerking
and
changing
lanes
at
regular
intervals
the
traffic
signature
of
was
unmistakable
the
intake
doctor
wanded
me
for
contraband
drew
fluids
from
my
various
parts
and
made
light
chitchat
with
me
along
the
way
it
was
the
last
time
i
saw
him
before
i
knew
it
a
beefy
orderly
had
me
by
the
arm
and
was
leading
me
to
my
room
he
had
a
thick
eastern
european
accent
and
he
ran
down
the
house
rules
for
me
in
battered
english
i
tried
to
devote
my
attention
to
it
to
forget
the
ward
denizens
i
passed
on
my
way
in
i
succeeded
enough
to
understand
the
relationship
of
my
legcuff
the
door
frame
and
the
elevators
the
orderly
fished
in
his
smock
and
produced
a
hypo
for
sleepink
he
said
panic
suppressed
since
my
arrival
welled
up
and
burst
over
wait
i
said
what
about
my
things
i
had
a
bag
with
me
talk
to
doctor
in
morning
he
said
gesturing
with
the
hypo
fitting
it
with
a
cartridge
and
popping
the
sterile
wrap
off
with
a
thumbswitch
now
for
sleepink
he
advanced
on
me
i
been
telling
myself
that
this
was
a
chance
to
rest
to
relax
and
gather
my
wits
soon
enough
i
sort
things
out
with
the
doctors
and
i
be
on
my
way
i
argue
my
way
out
of
it
but
here
came
boris
badinoff
with
his
magic
needle
and
all
reason
fled
i
scrambled
back
over
the
bed
and
pressed
against
the
window
it
barely
three
i
said
guessing
at
the
time
in
the
absence
of
my
comm
i
not
tired
i
go
to
sleep
when
i
am
for
sleepink
he
repeated
in
a
more
soothing
tone
no
that
all
right
i
tired
enough
long
night
last
night
i
just
lie
down
and
nap
now
all
right
no
need
for
needles
ok
he
grabbed
my
wrist
i
tried
to
tug
it
out
of
his
grasp
to
squirm
away
a
lot
of
good
dirty
fighting
in
tai
chi
groin
punches
and
and
they
all
fled
me
i
thrashed
like
a
fish
on
a
line
as
he
ran
the
hypo
over
the
crook
of
my
elbow
until
the
led
glowed
white
he
jabbed
down
with
it
and
i
felt
a
prick
for
a
second
i
thought
that
it
had
taken
effect
i
done
enough
chemical
sleep
in
my
years
with
the
tribe
that
i
developed
quite
a
tolerance
for
most
varieties
but
then
i
felt
that
unmistakable
heaviness
in
my
eyelids
the
melatonin
crash
that
signalled
the
onslaught
of
merciless
rest
i
collapsed
into
bed
i
spent
the
next
day
in
a
drugged
stupor
i
become
quite
accustomed
to
functioning
in
a
stupor
over
the
years
but
this
was
different
no
caffeine
for
starters
they
fed
me
and
i
had
a
meeting
with
a
nice
doctor
who
ran
it
down
for
me
i
was
here
for
observation
pending
a
competency
hearing
in
a
week
i
had
seven
days
to
prove
that
i
was
a
danger
to
myself
or
others
and
if
i
could
the
judge
would
let
me
go
it
like
i
a
drug
addict
huh
i
said
to
the
doctor
who
was
used
to
non
sequiturs
sure
sure
it
is
he
shifted
in
the
hard
chair
opposite
my
bed
getting
ready
to
go
no
really
i
not
just
running
my
mouth
it
like
this
do
think
i
have
a
problem
here
i
think
that
my
way
of
conducting
my
life
is
perfectly
harmless
like
a
speedfreak
who
thinks
that
she
just
having
a
great
time
being
ultraproductive
and
coming
out
ahead
of
the
game
but
her
friends
convinced
she
destroying
herself
they
see
the
danger
she
putting
herself
in
they
see
her
health
deteriorating
so
they
put
her
into
rehab
kicking
and
screaming
where
she
stays
until
she
figures
it
out
so
it
like
i
addicted
to
being
nuts
i
have
a
nonrational
view
of
the
world
around
me
an
view
you
are
meant
to
be
the
objective
observer
to
make
such
notes
as
are
necessary
to
determine
if
i
seeing
things
properly
or
through
a
haze
of
nutziness
for
as
long
as
i
go
on
taking
my
drug
shooting
up
my
craziness
you
keep
me
here
once
i
stop
once
i
accept
the
objective
truth
of
reality
you
let
me
go
what
then
do
i
become
a
recovering
nutcase
do
i
have
to
stand
against
the
siren
song
of
craziness
the
doctor
ran
his
hands
through
his
long
hair
and
bounced
his
knee
up
and
down
you
could
put
it
that
way
i
guess
so
tell
me
what
the
next
step
what
is
my
optimum
strategy
for
providing
compelling
evidence
of
my
repudiation
of
my
worldview
well
that
where
the
analogy
breaks
down
this
is
about
anything
demonstrable
there
no
one
thing
we
look
for
in
making
our
diagnosis
it
a
collection
of
things
a
protocol
for
evaluating
you
it
does
happen
overnight
either
you
were
committed
on
the
basis
of
evidence
that
you
had
made
threats
to
your
coworkers
due
to
a
belief
that
they
were
seeking
to
harm
you
interesting
can
we
try
a
little
thought
experiment
doctor
say
that
your
coworkers
really
seeking
to
harm
you
this
is
not
without
historical
precedent
right
they
seeking
to
sabotage
you
because
you
discovered
some
terrible
treachery
on
their
part
and
they
want
to
hush
you
up
so
they
provoke
a
reaction
from
you
and
use
it
as
the
basis
for
an
involuntary
committal
how
would
you
as
a
medical
professional
distinguish
that
scenario
from
one
in
which
the
patient
is
genuinely
paranoid
and
delusional
the
doctor
looked
away
it
in
the
protocol
we
find
it
there
i
see
i
said
moving
in
for
the
kill
i
see
where
would
i
get
more
information
on
the
protocol
i
like
to
research
it
before
my
hearing
i
sorry
the
doctor
said
we
do
provide
access
to
medical
texts
to
our
patients
why
not
how
can
i
defend
myself
against
a
charge
if
i
not
made
aware
of
the
means
by
which
my
defense
is
judged
that
hardly
seems
fair
the
doctor
stood
and
smoothed
his
coat
turned
his
badge
lanyard
so
that
his
picture
faced
outwards
art
you
not
here
to
defend
yourself
you
here
so
that
we
can
take
a
look
at
you
and
understand
what
going
on
if
you
have
been
set
up
we
discover
it
what
the
ratio
of
real
paranoids
to
people
who
been
set
up
in
your
experience
i
do
keep
stats
on
that
sort
of
thing
how
many
paranoids
have
been
released
because
they
were
vindicated
i
have
to
go
through
my
case
histories
is
it
more
than
ten
no
i
would
think
so
more
than
five
art
i
do
think
have
paranoids
ever
been
vindicated
is
this
observation
period
anything
more
than
a
formality
en
route
to
committal
come
on
doctor
just
let
me
know
where
i
stand
art
we
on
your
side
here
if
you
want
to
make
this
easy
on
yourself
then
you
should
understand
that
the
nurse
will
be
in
with
your
lunch
and
your
meds
in
a
few
minutes
then
you
be
allowed
out
on
the
ward
i
speak
to
you
there
more
if
you
want
doctor
it
a
simple
question
has
anyone
ever
been
admitted
to
this
facility
because
it
was
believed
he
had
paranoid
delusions
and
later
released
because
he
was
indeed
the
center
of
a
plot
art
it
not
appropriate
for
me
to
discuss
other
patients
histories
do
you
publish
case
studies
do
those
contain
confidential
information
disguised
with
pseudonyms
that
not
the
point
what
the
point
it
seems
to
me
that
my
optimal
strategy
here
is
to
repudiate
my
belief
that
fede
and
linda
are
plotting
against
me
if
i
still
believe
this
to
be
true
even
if
it
true
and
profess
a
belief
that
they
are
my
good
and
concerned
friends
in
other
words
if
they
are
indeed
plotting
against
me
i
must
profess
to
a
delusional
belief
that
they
are
in
order
to
prove
that
i
am
not
delusional
i
read
too
art
that
not
what
this
is
about
but
your
attitude
is
going
to
help
you
any
here
the
doctor
scribbled
on
his
comm
briefly
tapped
at
some
menus
i
leaned
across
and
stared
at
the
screen
that
looks
like
a
prescription
doctor
it
is
i
giving
you
a
mild
sedative
we
ca
help
you
until
you
calmer
and
ready
to
listen
i
perfectly
calm
i
just
disagree
with
you
i
am
the
sort
of
person
who
learns
through
debate
medication
wo
stop
that
we
see
the
doctor
said
and
left
before
i
could
muster
a
riposte
i
was
finally
allowed
onto
the
ward
dressed
in
what
the
nurses
called
day
clothes
the
civilian
duds
that
i
packed
before
leaving
the
hotel
which
an
orderly
retrieved
for
me
from
a
locked
closet
in
my
room
the
clustered
nuts
were
watching
slackjaw
tv
or
staring
out
the
windows
or
rocking
in
place
fidgeting
and
muttering
i
found
myself
a
seat
next
to
a
birdy
woman
whose
long
oily
hair
was
parted
down
the
middle
leaving
a
furrow
in
her
scalp
lined
with
twin
rows
of
dandruff
she
was
young
maybe
and
seemed
the
least
stuporous
of
the
lot
hello
i
said
to
her
she
smiled
shyly
then
pitched
forward
and
vomited
copiously
and
noisily
between
her
knees
i
shrank
back
and
struggled
to
keep
my
face
neutral
a
nurse
hastened
to
her
side
and
dropped
a
plastic
bucket
in
the
stream
of
puke
which
was
still
gushing
out
of
her
mouth
her
thin
chest
heaving
here
sarah
in
here
the
nurse
said
with
an
air
of
irritation
can
i
help
i
said
ridiculously
she
looked
sharply
at
me
art
is
it
why
are
you
in
group
it
after
one
group
i
asked
group
in
that
corner
there
she
gestured
at
a
collection
of
sagging
sofas
underneath
one
of
the
ward
windows
you
late
and
started
without
you
there
were
four
other
people
there
two
women
and
a
young
boy
and
a
doctor
in
mufti
identifiable
by
his
shoes
not
slippers
and
his
staff
of
office
the
almighty
throbbing
with
dread
i
moved
away
from
the
girl
to
the
sofa
cluster
and
stood
at
its
edge
the
group
turned
to
look
at
me
the
doctor
cleared
his
throat
group
this
is
art
glad
you
made
it
art
you
a
little
late
but
we
just
getting
started
here
so
that
ok
this
is
lucy
fatima
and
manuel
why
do
you
have
a
seat
his
voice
was
professionally
smooth
and
stultifying
i
sank
into
a
bright
orange
sofa
that
exhaled
a
cloud
of
dust
motes
that
danced
in
the
sun
streaming
through
the
windows
it
also
exhaled
a
breath
of
trapped
ancient
farts
and
antiseptic
the
de
that
gradually
numbed
my
nose
to
all
other
scents
on
the
ward
i
folded
my
hands
in
my
lap
and
tried
to
look
attentive
all
right
art
everyone
in
the
group
is
pretty
new
here
so
you
do
have
to
worry
about
not
knowing
what
what
there
are
no
right
or
wrong
things
the
only
rules
are
that
you
ca
interrupt
anyone
and
if
you
want
to
criticize
you
have
to
criticize
the
idea
and
not
the
person
who
said
it
all
right
sure
i
said
sure
let
get
started
well
are
you
eager
the
doctor
said
warmly
manuel
was
just
telling
us
about
his
friends
they
not
my
friends
manuel
said
angrily
they
the
reason
i
here
i
hate
them
go
on
the
doctor
said
i
already
you
yesterday
tony
and
musafir
they
trying
to
get
rid
of
me
i
make
them
look
bad
so
they
want
to
get
rid
of
me
why
do
you
think
you
make
them
look
bad
because
i
better
than
them
i
smarter

get
better
grades
i
score
more
goals
the
girls
like
me
better
they
hate
me
for
it
oh
yeah
you
the
cat
ass
pookie
lucy
said
she
was
about
fifteen
voluminously
fat
and
her
full
lips
twisted
in
an
elaborate
sneer
as
she
spoke
lucy
the
doctor
said
patiently
favoring
her
with
a
patronizing
smile
that
not
cool
ok
criticize
the
idea
not
the
person
and
only
when
your
turn
ok
lucy
rolled
her
eyes
with
the
eloquence
of
teenagedom
all
right
manuel
thank
you
group
do
you
have
any
positive
suggestions
for
manuel
stony
silence
ok
manuel
some
of
us
are
good
at
some
things
and
some
of
us
are
good
at
others
your
friends
do
hate
you
and
i
sure
that
if
you
think
about
it
you
know
that
you
do
hate
them
did
they
come
visit
you
last
weekend
successful
people
are
well
liked
and
you
no
exception
we
come
back
to
this
tomorrow
why
do
you
spend
the
time
until
then
thinking
of
three
examples
of
how
your
friends
showed
you
that
they
liked
you
and
you
can
tell
us
about
it
tomorrow
manuel
stared
out
the
window
ok
now
art
welcome
again
tell
us
why
you
here
i
in
for
observation
there
a
competency
hearing
at
the
end
of
the
week
linda
snorted
and
fatima
giggled
the
doctor
ignored
them
but
tell
us
you
think
you
ended
up
here
you
want
the
whole
story
whatever
parts
you
think
are
important
it
a
tribal
thing
i
see
the
doctor
said
it
like
this
i
said
it
used
to
be
that
the
way
you
chose
your
friends
was
by
finding
the
most
people
you
could
out
of
the
pool
of
people
who
lived
near
to
you
if
you
were
lucky
you
lived
near
a
bunch
of
people
you
could
get
along
with
this
was
a
lot
more
likely
in
the
olden
days
back
before
you
know
printing
and
radio
and
such
chances
were
that
you
grow
up
so
immersed
in
the
local
doctrine
that
you
never
even
think
to
question
it
if
you
were
a
genius
or
a
psycho
you
might
come
up
with
a
whole
new
way
of
thinking
and
if
you
could
pull
it
off
you
either
gather
up
a
bunch
of
people
who
liked
your
new
idea
or
you
go
somewhere
else
like
america
where
you
could
set
up
a
little
colony
of
people
who
agreed
with
you
most
of
the
time
though
people
who
did
get
along
with
their
neighbors
just
moped
around
until
they
died
very
interesting
the
doctor
said
interrupting
smoothly
but
you
were
going
to
tell
us
how
you
ended
up
here
yeah
lucy
said
this
is
a
history
lesson
it
group
get
to
the
point
i
getting
there
i
said
it
just
takes
some
background
if
you
going
to
understand
it
now
once
ideas
could
travel
more
freely
the
chances
of
you
finding
out
about
a
group
of
people
somewhere
else
that
you
might
get
along
with
increased
like
when
my
dad
was
growing
up
if
you
were
gay
and
from
a
big
city
chances
were
that
you
could
figure
out
where
other
gay
people
hung
out
and
go
and
i
waved
my
hands
be
right
but
if
you
were
from
a
small
town
you
might
not
even
know
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
being
gay
you
might
think
it
was
just
a
perversion
but
as
time
went
by
the
gay
people
in
the
big
cities
started
making
a
bigger
and
bigger
deal
out
of
being
gay
and
since
all
the
information
that
the
small
towns
consumed
came
from
big
cities
that
information
leaked
into
the
small
towns
and
more
gay
people
moved
to
the
big
cities
built
little
gay
zones
where
gay
was
normal
so
back
when
the
new
world
was
forming
and
sorting
out
its
borders
and
territories
information
was
flowing
pretty
well
you
had
telegraphs
you
had
the
pony
express
you
had
thousands
of
little
newspapers
that
got
carried
around
on
railroads
and
streetcars
and
steamers
and
it
was
long
before
everyone
knew
what
kind
of
person
went
where
even
back
in
europe
and
asia
people
immigrated
here
and
picked
where
they
wanted
to
live
based
on
what
sort
of
people
they
wanted
to
be
with
which
ideas
they
liked
best
a
lot
of
it
was
religious
but
that
was
just
on
the
surface
underneath
it
all
was
aesthetics
you
wanted
to
go
somewhere
where
the
girls
were
pretty
in
the
way
you
understood
prettiness
where
the
food
smelled
like
food
and
not
garbage
where
shops
sold
goods
you
could
recognize
lots
of
other
factors
were
at
play
too
of
course
jobs
and
jim
crow
laws
and
whatnot
but
the
tug
of
finding
people
like
you
is
like
gravity
lots
of
things
work
against
gravity
but
gravity
always
wins
in
the
end
in
the
end
everything
collapses
in
the
end
everyone
ends
up
with
the
people
that
are
most
like
them
that
they
can
find
i
was
warming
to
my
subject
now
in
that
flow
state
that
great
athletes
get
into
when
they
just
know
where
to
swing
their
bat
where
to
plant
their
foot
i
knew
that
i
was
working
up
a
great
rant
to
the
age
of
email
slowly
but
surely
we
begin
to
mediate
almost
all
of
our
communication
over
networks
why
walk
down
the
hallway
to
ask
a
coworker
a
question
when
you
can
just
send
email
you
do
need
to
interrupt
them
and
you
can
keep
going
on
your
own
projects
and
if
you
forget
the
answer
you
can
just
open
the
message
again
and
look
at
the
response
there
all
kinds
of
ways
to
interact
with
our
friends
over
the
network
we
can
play
hallucinogenic
games
chat
send
pictures
code
music
funny
articles
metric
fuckloads
of
porn
the
interaction
is
sure
you
gain
three
pounds
every
year
you
spend
behind
the
desk
instead
of
walking
down
the
hall
to
ask
your
buddy
where
he
wants
to
go
for
lunch
but
that
a
small
price
to
pay
so
you
a
fish
out
of
water
you
live
in
arizona
but
you
sixteen
years
old
and
all
your
neighbors
are
and
you
get
ten
billion
channels
of
media
on
your
desktop
all
the
good
stuff
everything
that
tickles
you
comes
out
of
some
clique
of
hyperurban
in
south
philly
they
making
cool
art
music
clothes
you
read
their
mailing
lists
and
you
can
tell
that
they
exactly
the
kind
of
people
who
really
appreciate
you
for
who
you
are
in
the
old
days
you
pack
your
bags
and
hitchhike
across
the
country
and
move
to
your
community
but
you
sixteen
and
that
a
pretty
scary
step
why
move
these
kids
live
online
at
lunch
before
school
and
all
night
they
comming
in
talking
trash
sending
around
photos
chatting
online
you
can
be
a
peer
you
can
hop
into
these
discussions
play
the
games
chord
with
one
hand
while
chatting
up
some
hottie
a
couple
thousand
miles
away
only
you
ca
you
ca
because
they
chat
at
seven
am
while
they
getting
ready
for
school
they
chat
at
five
pm
while
they
working
on
their
homework
their
late
nights
end
at
three
am
but
those
are
their
times
not
yours
if
you
get
up
at
seven
they
already
at
school
it
ten
there
so
you
start
to
f
with
your
sleep
schedule
you
get
up
at
four
am
so
you
can
chat
with
your
friends
you
go
to
bed
at
nine
that
when
they
go
to
bed
used
to
be
that
it
was
stock
brokers
and
journos
and
factory
workers
who
did
that
kind
of
thing
but
now
it
anyone
who
does
fit
in
the
geniuses
and
lunatics
to
whom
the
local
doctrine
tastes
wrong
they
choose
their
peers
based
on
similarity
not
geography
and
they
keep
themselves
awake
at
the
same
time
as
them
but
you
need
to
make
some
nod
to
localness
too
got
ta
be
at
work
with
everyone
else
got
ta
get
to
the
bank
when
it
open
got
ta
buy
your
groceries
you
end
up
hardly
sleeping
at
all
you
end
up
sneaking
naps
in
the
middle
of
the
day
or
after
dinner
trying
to
reconcile
biological
imperatives
with
cultural
ones
needless
to
say
that
alienates
you
even
further
from
the
folks
at
home
and
drives
you
more
and
more
into
the
arms
of
your
online
peers
of
choice
so
you
get
the
tribes
people
all
over
the
world
who
are
really
secret
agents
for
some
other
time
zone
some
other
way
of
looking
at
the
world
some
other
zeitgeist
unlike
other
tribes
you
can
change
allegiance
by
doing
nothing
more
that
resetting
your
alarm
clock
like
any
tribe
they
are
primarily
loyal
to
each
other
and
anyone
outside
of
the
tribe
is
only
mostly
human
that
may
sound
extreme
but
this
is
what
it
comes
down
to
tribes
are
aesthetics
ethos
traditions
ways
of
getting
things
done
they
competitive
they
may
not
all
be
based
on
there
are
knitting
tribes
and
vampire
tribes
and
christian
rock
tribes
but
they
always
existed
mostly
these
tribes
are
little
more
than
a
it
takes
to
amplify
the
cultural
fissioning
of
or
knitting
into
a
conspiracy
their
interests
are
commercial
industrial
cultural
culinary
a
tribesman
will
patronize
a
fellow
restaurant
or
give
him
a
manufacturing
contract
or
hire
his
taxi
not
because
of
xenophobia
but
because
of
homophilia
i
know
that
my
tribesman
taxi
will
conduct
its
way
through
traffic
in
a
way
that
i
comfortable
with
whether
in
san
francisco
boston
london
or
calcutta
i
know
that
the
food
will
be
palatable
in
a
tribal
restaurant
that
a
book
by
a
tribalist
will
be
a
good
read
that
a
gross
of
widgets
will
be
manufactured
to
the
exacting
standards
of
my
tribe
like
i
said
though
unless
you
at
ground
zero
in
the
tribe
native
time
zone
your
sleep
sched
is
just
you
live
on
sleepdep
and
chat
and
secret
agentry
until
it
second
nature
you
cranky
and
subrational
most
of
the
time
close
your
eyes
on
the
freeway
and
dreams
paint
themselves
on
the
back
of
your
lids
demanding
their
time
almost
as
heavy
as
gravity
almost
as
remorseless
there
a
lot
of
flaming
and
splitting
and
vitriol
in
the
tribes
they
more
fractured
than
a
potsherd
tribal
anthropologists
have
built
up
incredible
histories
of
the
fissioning
of
the
tribes
since
they
were
first
recognized
most
of
are
online
you
can
look
up
we
stab
each
other
in
the
back
routinely
and
with
no
more
provocation
than
a
sleepdep
hallucination
which
is
how
i
got
here
i
a
member
of
the
eastern
standard
tribe
centered
around
new
york
but
we
ramified
up
and
down
the
coast
boston
and
toronto
and
philly
a
bunch
of
montreal
anglos
and
some
wannabes
in
upstate
new
york
around
buffalo
and
schenectady
i
was
doing
tribal
work
in
london
serving
the
eastern
standard
agenda
working
with
a
couple
of
tribesmen
well
one
tribesman
and
my
girlfriend
who
i
thought
was
unaffiliated
turns
out
though
that
they
both
double
agents
they
sold
out
to
the
pacific
daylight
tribe
lameass
phonies
out
in
la
slick
silicon
valley
bizdev
sharks
pseudo
hipsters
in
san
franscarcity
once
i
threatened
to
expose
them
they
set
me
up
had
me
thrown
in
here
i
looked
around
proudly
having
just
completed
a
real
fun
little
excursion
through
a
topic
near
and
dear
to
my
heart
mount
rushmore
looked
back
at
me
stony
and
bovine
and
uncomprehending
baby
lucy
said
rolling
her
eyes
again
you
need
some
new
meds
could
be
i
said
but
this
is
for
real
is
there
a
comm
on
the
ward
we
can
look
it
up
together
oh
prove
it
all
right
nothing
but
truth
online
i
did
say
that
there
articles
about
the
tribes
it
was
a
lead
story
on
the
cbc
social
science
site
last
year
uh
huh
sure
right
next
to
the
sasquatch
videos
i
talking
about
the
cbc
lucy
let
go
look
it
up
lucy
mimed
taking
an
invisible
comm
out
of
her
cleavage
and
prodding
at
it
with
an
invisible
stylus
she
settled
an
invisible
pair
of
spectacles
on
her
nose
and
nodded
sagely
oh
yeah
sure
really
interesting
stuff
i
realized
that
i
was
arguing
with
a
crazy
person
and
turned
to
the
doctor
you
must
have
read
about
the
tribes
right
the
doctor
acted
as
if
he
had
heard
me
that
just
fascinating
art
thank
you
for
sharing
that
now
here
a
question
i
like
you
to
think
about
and
maybe
you
can
tell
us
the
answer
tomorrow
what
are
the
ways
that
your
friends
the
ones
you
say
betrayed
you
used
to
show
you
how
much
they
respected
you
and
liked
you
think
hard
about
this
i
think
you
be
surprised
by
the
conclusions
you
come
to
what
that
supposed
to
mean
just
what
i
said
art
think
hard
about
how
you
and
your
friends
interacted
and
you
see
that
they
really
like
you
did
you
hear
what
i
just
said
have
you
heard
of
the
tribes
sure
sure
but
this
is
about
the
tribes
art
this
is
about
you
and
he
consulted
his
comm
fede
and
linda
they
care
about
you
a
great
deal
and
they
terribly
worried
about
you
you
just
think
about
it
now
he
said
recrossing
his
legs
fatima
you
told
us
yesterday
about
your
mother
and
i
asked
you
to
think
about
how
feels
can
you
tell
the
group
what
you
found
out
but
fatima
was
off
in
eyes
glazed
and
mouth
hanging
slack
manuel
nudged
her
with
his
toe
then
when
she
failed
to
stir
aimed
a
kick
at
her
shin
the
doctor
held
a
hand
out
and
grabbed
manuel
slippered
toe
that
all
right
let
move
on
to
lucy
i
tuned
out
as
lucy
began
an
elaborate
and
rant
about
her
eating
habits
prodded
on
by
the
doctor
the
enormity
of
the
situation
was
coming
home
to
me
i
could
win
if
i
averred
that
fede
and
linda
were
my
boon
companions
i
still
be
found
incompetent
after
all
what
competent
person
threatens
his
boon
companions
if
i
stuck
to
my
story
i
be
found
incompetent
and
medicated
besides
like
poor
little
fatima
zombified
by
the
psychoactive
cocktail
either
way
i
was
stuck
stuck
on
the
roof
now
and
it
getting
very
uncomfortable
indeed
stuck
because
i
am
officially
incompetent
and
doomed
and
damned
to
indefinite
rest
on
the
ward
stuck
because
every
passing
moment
here
is
additional
time
for
the
hamsters
to
run
their
courses
in
my
mind
piling
regret
on
worry
stuck
because
as
soon
as
i
am
discovered
i
will
be
stupified
by
the
meds
administered
by
stern
and
loving
and
thoroughly
disappointed
doctors
i
still
have
managed
to
remember
any
of
their
names
they
are
interchangeable
well
shod
and
endowed
with
badges
on
lanyards
and
soothing
and
implacable
and
entirely
unappreciative
of
my
rhetorical
skills
stuck
the
chimneys
stand
tall
around
the
roof
unevenly
distributed
according
to
some
inscrutable
logic
that
could
only
be
understood
with
the
assistance
of
drawings
blueprints
mechanical
and
structural
engineering
diagrams
surely
though
they
are
optimized
to
wick
hot
air
out
of
the
giant
brick
pile
guts
and
exhaust
it
i
move
to
the
one
nearest
the
stairwell
it
is
tarred
in
place
its
apron
lined
with
a
of
cinderblocks
that
have
pools
of
brackish
water
and
cobwebs
gathered
in
their
holes
i
stick
my
hand
in
the
first
and
drag
it
off
the
apron
i
repeat
it
now
the
chimney
is
standing
on
its
own
in
the
middle
of
a
nonsensical
my
hands
are
dripping
with
muck
and
grotendousness
i
wipe
them
off
on
the
pea
gravel
and
then
dry
them
on
my
boxer
shorts
then
hug
the
chimney
and
lean
forward
it
gives
slowly
slightly
and
springs
back
i
give
it
a
harder
push
really
give
it
my
weight
but
it
wo
budge
belatedly
i
realize
that
i
standing
on
its
apron
trying
to
lift
myself
along
with
the
chimney
i
take
a
step
back
and
lean
way
forward
try
again
it
awkward
but
i
making
progress
bent
like
an
ell
pushing
with
my
legs
and
lower
back
i
feel
something
pop
around
my
sacrum
know
that
i
regret
this
deeply
when
my
back
kacks
out
completely
but
it
be
all
for
naught
if
i
do
keep
on
pushing
then
suddenly
the
chimney
gives
its
apron
swinging
up
and
hitting
me
in
the
knees
so
that
i
topple
forward
with
it
smashing
my
chin
on
its
hood
for
a
moment
i
lie
down
atop
it
like
a
stupefied
lover
awestruck
by
my
own
inanity
the
smell
of
blood
rouses
me
i
tentatively
reach
my
hand
to
my
chin
and
feel
the
ragged
edge
of
a
cut
there
opened
from
the
tip
and
along
my
jawbone
almost
to
my
ear
the
cut
is
too
fresh
to
hurt
but
it
bleeding
freely
and
i
know
it
sting
like
a
bastard
soon
enough
i
go
to
my
knees
and
scream
then
scream
again
as
i
rend
open
my
chin
further
my
knees
and
shins
are
grooved
with
deep
parallel
cuts
gritted
with
gravel
and
grime
standing
hurts
so
much
that
i
go
back
to
my
knees
holler
again
at
the
pain
in
my
legs
as
i
grind
more
gravel
into
my
cuts
and
again
as
i
tear
my
face
open
some
more
i
end
up
fetal
on
my
side
sticky
with
blood
and
weeping
softly
with
an
exquisite
that
is
more
than
the
cuts
and
bruises
more
than
the
betrayal
more
than
the
foreknowledge
of
punishment
i
am
weeping
for
myself
and
my
identity
and
my
smarts
over
happiness
and
the
thought
that
i
would
indeed
choose
happiness
over
smarts
any
day
too
damned
smart
for
my
own
good
i
just
do
get
it
fede
said
art
tried
to
keep
the
exasperation
out
of
his
voice
it
simple
he
said
it
like
a
car
radio
with
a
button
you
drive
around
on
the
masspike
and
your
car
automatically
peers
with
nearby
vehicles
it
grabs
the
current
song
on
someone
else
stereo
and
streamloads
it
you
listen
to
it
if
you
do
hit
the
button
the
car
starts
grabbing
everything
it
can
from
the
peer
all
the
music
on
the
stereo
and
cues
it
up
for
continued
play
once
that
pool
is
exhausted
it
queries
your
peer
for
a
list
of
its
peers
the
cars
that
it
getting
its
music
from
and
sees
if
any
of
them
are
in
range
and
downloads
from
them
so
it
like
you
exploring
a
doing
an
automated
guided
search
through
traffic
for
the
car
whose
owner
has
collected
the
music
you
most
want
to
listen
to
but
i
hate
your
music
i
do
want
to
listen
to
the
stuff
on
your
radio
fine
that
what
the
button
is
for
it
skips
to
another
car
and
starts
streamloading
off
of
its
drive
fede
started
to
say
something
and
art
held
up
his
hand
and
if
you
exhaust
all
the
available
cars
the
system
recycles
but
asks
its
peers
for
files
collected
from
other
sources
you
might
hate
the
songs
i
downloaded
from
al
but
the
songs
i
got
from
bennie
are
right
up
your
alley
the
backstop
the
whole
system
they
got
the
biggest
collections
on
the
freeway
and
they
the
ones
most
likely
to
build
carefully
playlists
they
got
entire
genres
the
whole
history
of
the
blues
say
from
steel
cylinders
on
on
their
drives
so
we
encourage
them
when
you
go
through
a
paypoint
a
toll
booth
we
debit
you
for
the
stuff
that
you
the
stuff
you
listened
to
and
kept
unless
that
is
you
got
more
than
say
songs
onboard
then
you
go
free
it
counterintuitive
i
know
but
just
look
at
the
numbers
ok
a
radio
with
a
button
i
think
i
get
it
but
but
who
going
to
want
to
use
this
it
unpredictable
you
got
no
guarantee
you
get
the
songs
you
want
to
hear
art
smiled
exactly
fede
gave
him
a
wave
do
you
see
that
the
part
it
the
thrill
of
the
chase
nobody
gets
excited
about
beating
traffic
on
a
back
road
that
always
empty
but
get
on
the
after
a
hard
day
at
work
and
drive
it
at
for
two
hours
without
once
touching
your
brakes
and
it
like
god
reached
down
and
parted
the
red
seas
for
you
you
get
a
sense
of
most
of
the
time
your
car
stereo
gon
na
play
the
same
junk
you
always
heard
just
background
sound
but
sometimes
ah
sometimes
you
hit
a
sweet
spot
and
get
the
best
tunes
you
ever
heard
if
you
put
a
rat
in
a
cage
with
a
lever
that
does
give
food
pellets
he
push
it
once
or
twice
and
give
up
set
the
lever
to
always
deliver
food
pellets
and
he
push
it
when
he
gets
hungry
set
it
to
deliver
food
pellets
and
he
bang
on
it
until
he
passes
out
heh
fede
said
good
rant
and
and
it
cool
fede
looked
off
into
the
middle
distance
a
while
radio
with
a
button
that
great
actually
amazing
stupendous
he
snatched
the
from
its
box
on
art
desk
and
did
a
little
war
dance
around
the
room
whooping
art
followed
the
dance
from
his
ergonomic
chair
swiveling
around
as
the
interface
tchotchkes
that
branched
from
its
undersides
chittered
to
keep
his
various
bones
and
muscles
firmly
supported
his
office
was
more
like
a
model
of
a
proper
office
in
lilliputian
london
style
so
the
war
dance
was
less
impressive
than
it
might
have
been
with
more
room
to
express
itself
you
like
it
then
art
said
once
fede
had
run
out
of
steam
i
do
i
do
i
do
great
great
so
yes
so
what
do
we
do
with
it
should
i
write
up
a
formal
proposal
and
send
it
to
jersey
how
much
detail
sketches
code
fragments
want
me
to
mock
up
the
interface
and
the
network
model
fede
cocked
an
eyebrow
at
him
what
are
you
talking
about
well
we
give
this
to
jersey
they
submit
the
proposal
they
walk
away
with
the
contract
right
that
our
job
right
no
art
that
not
our
job
our
job
is
to
see
to
it
that
submits
a
bad
proposal
not
that
jersey
submits
a
good
one
this
is
big
we
roll
this
together
and
it
bigger
than
masspike
we
can
run
this
across
every
goddamned
toll
road
in
the
world
jersey
not
paying
for
this
not
yet
anyway
and
someone
should
you
want
to
sell
this
to
them
well
i
want
to
sell
this
who
to
sell
it
to
is
another
matter
art
waved
his
hands
confusedly
you
joking
right
fede
crouched
down
beside
art
and
looked
into
his
eyes
no
art
i
am
serious
as
a
funeral
here
this
is
big
and
it
not
in
the
scope
of
work
that
we
signed
up
for
you
and
me
we
can
score
big
on
this
but
not
by
handing
it
over
to
those
shitheads
in
jersey
and
begging
for
a
bonus
what
are
you
talking
about
who
else
would
pay
for
this
you
have
to
ask
for
starters
anyone
working
on
a
bid
for
masspike
or
tollpass
or
fastpass
or
europass
but
we
ca
sell
this
to
just
fede
why
not
jesus
why
not
because
of
the
tribes
fede
quirked
him
half
a
smile
sure
the
tribes
what
does
that
mean
art
you
know
that
stuff
is
horseshit
right
it
just
a
game
when
it
comes
down
to
your
personal
welfare
you
ca
depend
on
time
zones
this
is
more
job
than
calling
you
know
art
squirmed
and
flushed
lots
of
us
take
this
stuff
seriously
fede
it
not
just
a
does
loyalty
mean
anything
to
you
fede
laughed
nastily
loyalty
if
you
doing
all
of
this
out
of
loyalty
then
why
are
you
drawing
a
paycheck
look
i
rather
that
this
go
to
jersey
basically
decent
sorts
and
i
drawn
a
lot
of
pay
from
them
over
the
years
but
they
have
paid
for
this
they
would
give
us
a
free
ride
so
why
should
we
give
them
one
all
i
saying
is
we
can
offer
this
to
jersey
of
course
but
they
have
to
bid
for
it
in
a
competitive
marketplace
i
do
want
to
gouge
them
just
collect
a
fair
market
price
for
our
goods
you
saying
you
do
feel
any
fundamental
loyalty
to
anything
fede
that
what
i
saying
and
you
saying
that
i
a
sucker
for
putting
loyalty
ahead
of
personal
gain
after
all
no
one
else
is
right
exactly
then
how
did
this
idea
become
fede
i
came
up
with
it
fede
lost
his
nasty
smile
there
loyalty
and
then
there
loyalty
no
really
you
and
i
are
a
team
i
rely
on
you
and
you
rely
on
me
we
loyal
to
something
concrete
each
other
the
eastern
standard
tribe
is
an
abstraction
it
a
whole
bunch
of
people
and
neither
of
us
like
most
of
it
useful
and
pleasant
but
you
ca
put
your
trust
in
institutions
otherwise
you
get
nazism
and
patriotism
blind
patriotism
so
there
no
other
kind
just
jingoism
you
either
loyal
to
your
immediate
circle
of
friends
or
you
a
deluded
dupe
no
that
not
what
i
saying
so
where
does
informed
loyalty
leave
off
and
jingoism
begin
you
come
on
all
patronizing
when
i
talk
about
being
loyal
to
the
tribe
and
you
certainly
not
loyal
to
nor
are
you
loyal
to
jersey
what
greater
purpose
are
you
loyal
to
well
humanity
for
starters
really
what
that
when
it
at
home
huh
how
do
you
express
loyalty
to
something
as
big
and
abstract
as
well
that
comes
down
to
morals
right
not
doing
things
that
poison
the
world
paying
taxes
change
to
panhandlers
supporting
charities
fede
drummed
his
fingers
on
his
thighs
not
murdering
or
raping
you
know
being
a
good
person
a
moral
person
ok
that
a
good
code
of
conduct
i
all
for
not
murdering
and
raping
and
not
just
because
it
but
because
a
world
where
the
social
norms
include
murdering
and
raping
is
a
bad
one
for
me
to
live
in
exactly
that
the
purpose
of
morals
and
loyalty
right
to
create
social
norms
that
produce
a
world
you
want
to
live
in
right
and
that
why
loyalty
is
important
art
smiled
trap
baited
and
sprung
ok
so
institutional
loyalty
loyalty
to
a
tribe
or
a
nation
that
not
an
important
social
norm
as
far
as
concerned
we
could
abandon
all
pretense
of
institutional
loyalty
art
dropped
his
voice
you
could
go
to
work
for
the
jersey
boys
sabotaging
telekom
just
because
they
willing
to
pay
you
to
do
it
nothing
to
do
with
tribal
loyalty
just
a
job
fede
looked
uncomfortable
sensing
the
impending
rhetorical
headlock
he
nodded
cautiously
which
means
that
the
jersey
boys
have
no
reason
to
be
loyal
to
you
it
just
a
job
so
if
there
were
an
opportunity
for
them
to
gain
some
personal
advantage
by
selling
you
out
turning
you
into
a
patsy
for
them
well
they
should
just
go
ahead
and
do
it
right
uh
do
worry
it
a
rhetorical
question
jersey
boys
sell
you
out
you
take
their
fall
they
benefit
if
there
was
no
institutional
loyalty
that
where
you
end
up
right
that
the
social
norm
you
want
no
of
course
it
is
no
of
course
not
you
want
a
social
norm
where
individuals
can
be
disloyal
to
the
collective
but
not
vice
versa
yes
yes
but
loyalty
is
bidirectional
there
no
basis
on
which
you
may
expect
loyalty
from
an
institution
unless
you
loyal
to
it
i
suppose
you
know
it
i
know
it
institutional
loyalty
is
every
bit
as
much
about
informed
as
personal
loyalty
is
the
tribe
takes
care
of
me
i
take
care
of
the
tribe
we
negotiate
a
separate
payment
from
jersey
for
this
after
all
this
is
outside
of
the
scope
of
work
that
we
being
paid
for
and
we
split
the
money
down
the
middle
we
work
in
a
residual
income
with
jersey
too
because
as
you
say
this
is
bigger
than
masspike
it
a
genuinely
good
idea
and
there
enough
to
go
around
all
right
are
you
asking
me
or
telling
me
i
asking
you
this
will
require
both
of
our
cooperation
i
going
to
need
to
manufacture
an
excuse
to
go
stateside
to
explain
this
to
them
and
supervise
the
prototyping
you
going
to
have
to
hold
down
the
fort
here
at
and
make
sure
that
i
clear
to
do
my
thing
if
you
want
to
go
and
sell
this
idea
elsewhere
well
that
going
to
require
my
cooperation
or
at
least
my
silence
if
i
turn
this
over
to
they
pop
you
for
industrial
espionage
so
we
need
each
other
art
stood
and
looked
down
at
fede
who
was
a
good
ten
centimeters
shorter
than
he
looked
down
at
fede
sweaty
upper
lip
and
creased
brow
we
a
good
team
fede
i
do
want
to
toss
away
an
opportunity
but
i
also
do
want
to
exploit
it
at
the
expense
of
my
own
morals
can
you
agree
to
work
with
me
on
this
and
trust
me
to
do
the
right
thing
fede
looked
up
yes
he
said
on
later
reflection
art
thought
that
the
came
too
quickly
but
then
he
was
just
relieved
to
hear
it
of
course
of
course
yes
let
do
it
that
just
fine
art
said
let
get
to
work
then
they
fell
into
their
traditional
division
of
labor
then
art
working
on
a
variety
of
plans
dividing
each
into
subplans
then
devising
protocols
for
user
testing
to
see
what
would
work
in
the
field
fede
working
on
logistics
from
plane
tickets
to
personal
days
to
budget
and
charts
they
worked
side
by
side
but
still
used
the
collaboration
tools
that
art
had
grown
up
with
designed
to
allow
remote
pseudonymous
parties
to
fit
their
separate
work
components
into
the
same
structure
resolving
schedule
and
planning
collisions
where
it
could
and
throwing
exceptions
where
it
could
they
worked
beside
each
other
and
each
hardly
knew
the
other
was
there
and
that
art
thought
when
he
thought
of
it
when
the
receptionist
commed
him
to
tell
him
that
linderrr
freakin
teabags
was
there
for
him
that
was
the
defining
characteristic
of
a
tribalist
a
norm
a
modus
operandi
a
way
of
being
that
did
not
distinguish
between
communication
and
communication
at
a
distance
linderrr
fede
said
cocking
an
eyebrow
i
hit
her
with
my
car
art
said
ah
fede
said
smooth
art
waved
a
hand
impatiently
at
him
and
went
out
to
the
reception
area
to
fetch
her
the
receptionist
had
precious
little
patience
for
entertaining
personal
visitors
and
linda
in
track
pants
and
a
baggy
sweater
was
clearly
not
a
professional
contact
the
receptionist
glared
at
him
as
he
commed
into
the
lobby
and
extended
his
hand
to
linda
who
took
it
put
it
on
her
shoulder
grabbed
his
ass
crushed
their
pelvises
together
and
jammed
her
tongue
in
his
ear
i
missed
you
she
slurped
the
buzz
of
her
voice
making
him
writhe
i
not
wearing
any
knickers
she
continued
loud
enough
that
he
was
sure
that
the
receptionist
heard
he
felt
the
blush
creeping
over
his
face
and
neck
and
ears
the
receptionist
dammit
why
was
he
thinking
about
the
receptionist
linda

said
pulling

thought

it
less
socially
awkward

english
ca

awkwardness

and
he
trailed
off
realizing
he
did
actually
know
the
receptionist
name
the
receptionist
glared
at
him
from
under
a
cap
of
shining
red
hair
narrowing
her
eyes
which
were
painted
in
high
style
with
kubrick
faces
my
is
tonaishah
she
hissed

her
through
i
a
little
randy
she
said
directly
into
his
ear

boner

tried
to
rewind
the
conversation
and
figure
out
how
they
came
to
this
pass
but
he
could
was
linda
really
acting
nuts
or
was
he
just
reading
her

minute

fede
she
said
i
hope
he
was
expecting
anything
special
i
not
really
dressed
for
it
he
stifled
a
snotty
remark
after
all
that
she
was
going
to
go
and
meet
fede
so
what
the
hell
were
they
arguing
about
on
the
other
hand
he
gotten
his
way
had
he
he
led
her
by
the
hand
to
his
office
and
beyond
every
doorway
they
passed
was
a
experience
designer
pretending
not
to
peek
at
them
as
they
walked
by
having
heard
every
word
through
the
tricky
acoustics
of
house
fede
he
said
stiffly
this
is
linda
linda
this
is
fede
fede
stood
and
treated
linda
to
his
big
suave
grin
fede
might
be
short
and
he
might
have
paranoid
delusions
but
he
was
trim
and
well
groomed
with
the
sort
of
finicky
moustache
that
looked
like
a
rotting
caterpillar
if
you
did
trim
it
every
morning
he
liked
to
work
out
and
had
a
tight
waist
and
a
gut
you
could
bounce
a
quarter
off
of
and
liked
to
wear
tight
shirts
that
showed
off
his
overall
fitness
made
him
stand
out
among
the
spongy
of
the
corporate
world
art
had
never
given
it
much
thought
but
now
standing
with
fede
and
linda
in
his
tiny
office
breathing
in
fede
lilac
vegetal
and
shampoo
he
felt
paunchy
and
sloppy
ah
fede
said
taking
her
hand
the
one
you
hit
with
your
car
it
a
pleasure
you
seem
to
be
recovering
nicely
too
linda
smiled
and
gave
him
a
peck
on
the
cheek
a
few
strands
of
her
bobbed
hair
sticking
to
his
moustache
like
cobwebs
as
she
pulled
away
it
was
just
a
love
tap
she
said
i
be
fine
fede
from
new
york
art
said

british
people

linda
said
wrinkling
her
nose
there
tonaishah
art
said
weakly
who
fede
said
the
receptionist
linda
said
not
a
very
nice
person
with
the
eyes
fede
said
wriggling
his
fingers
around
his
temples
to
indicate
elaborate
eye
makeup
that
her
linda
said
nasty
piece
of
work
fede
said
never
trusted
her
not
another
ue
person

linda
said
sizing
fede
up
and
giving
art
a
playful
elbow
in
the
ribs

linda
said
slipping
an
arm
around
art
waist
wrapping
her
fingers
around
the
waistband
of
his
trousers
did
you
need
to
grab
your
jacket
honey
art
jacket
was
hanging
on
the
back
of
his
office
door
and
to
get
at
it
he
had
to
crush
himself
against
linda
and
maneuver
the
door
shut
he
felt
her
breasts
soft
on
his
chest
felt
her
breath
tickle
his
ear
and
forgot
all
about
their
argument
in
the
corridor
all
right
art
said
hooking
his
jacket
over
his
shoulder
with
a
finger
feeling
flushed
and
fluttery
ok
let
go
lovely
to
have
met
you
fede
linda
said
taking
his
hand
and
likewise
fede
said
vigorous
sex
ensued
art
rolled
out
of
bed
at
dark
in
the
morning
awakened
by
circadians
and
endorphins
and
bladder
he
staggered
to
the
toilet
in
the
familiar
gloom
of
his
shabby
little
rooms
did
his
business
marveled
at
the
tenderness
of
his
privates
fumbled
for
the
flush
mechanism
british
and
plumbing
being
two
completely
opposite
notions
and
staggered
back
to
bed
the
screen
of
his
comm
nestled
on
the
end
table
washed
the
room
in
light
tugged
the
sheets
off
of
linda
when
he
got
up
and
there
she
was
chest
rising
and
falling
softly
body
rumpled
and
sprawled
after
their
gymnastics
it
had
been
transcendent
and
messy
and
the
sheets
were
coarse
with
dried
fluids
he
knelt
on
the
bed
and
fussed
with
the
covers
some
trying
for
an
equitable
if
not
chivalrously
so
division
of
blankets
he
bent
forward
to
kiss
at
a
he
left
on
her
shoulder
his
back
went
pop
somewhere
down
in
the
lumbar
somewhere
just
above
his
tailbone
a
deep
and
unforgiving
ominous
as
the
cocking
of
a
revolver
he
put
his
hand
there
and
it
felt
ok
so
he
cautiously
lay
back
of
the
way
down
his
entire
lower
back
seized
up
needles
of
fire
raced
down
his
legs
and
through
his
groin
and
he
collapsed
he
with
pain
an
inhuman
sound
he
had
known
he
could
make
and
the
rapid
emptying
of
his
lungs
deepened
the
spasm
and
he
mewled
linda
opened
a
groggy
eye
and
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
what
is
it
hon
he
tried
to
straighten
out
to
find
a
position
in
which
the
horrible
relentless
pain
returned
whence
it
came
each
motion
was
agony
finally
the
pain
subsided
and
he
found
himself
pretzelled
knees
up
body
twisted
to
the
left
head
twisted
to
the
right
he
did
not
dare
budge
from
this
posture
terrified
that
the
pain
would
return
it
my
back
he
gasped
whah

back

put
it
out

half
an
hour
later
he
had
gingerly
arranged
himself
with
his
knees
up
and
his
hips
straight
and
he
was
breathing
deeply
willing
the
spasms
to
unclench
thanks
he
said
what
now
should
i
call
a
doctor
he
just
give
me
painkillers
and

weight

he
and
fede
had
worked
out
his
cover
story

some
there
a
chemist
at
paddington
station
that
delivers
i
do
it
you
lie
flat
and
so
it
began
bad
enough
to
be
helpless
weak
as
a
kitten
and
immobile
but
to
be
at
the
whim
of
someone
else
to
have
to
provide
sufficient
excuse
for
every
use
of
his
comm
every
crawl
across
the
flat
christ
just
give
me
my
comm
please

can
do

faster

explain
how
to
do
it
in
hours
he
was
ready
to
tear
the
throat
out
of
anyone
who
tried
to
communicate
with
him
he
harangued
linda
out
of
the
flat
and
crawled
to
the
kitchen
floor
painstakingly
assembling
a
nest
of
pillows
and
sofa
cushions
close
to
the
icemaker
and
the
painkillers
and
toilet
his
landlady
an
unfriendly
chinese
lady
who
had
apparently
been
wealthy
beyond
words
in
hong
kong
and
clearly
resented
her
reduced
station
agreed
to
sign
for
the
supply
drops
he
commed
to
various
retailers
around
london
he
was
giving
himself
a
serious
crick
in
his
neck
and
shoulder
from
working
supine
comm
held
over
his
head
the
painkillers
weighted
his
arms
and
churned
his
guts
and
at
least
twice
an
hour
he
grog
his
way
into
a
better
position
forgetting
the
tenderness
in
his
back
and
bark
afresh
as
his
nerves
shrieked
and
sizzled
two
days
later
and
he
was
almost
unrecognizable
a
gamey
unshaven
lump
in
the
tiny
kitchen
his
nest
gray
with
sweat
and
stiff
with
spilled
curry
he
suspected
that
he
was
overmedicating
forgetting
whether
he
taken
his
tablets
and
taking
more
in
one
of
his
more
lucid
moments
he
realized
that
there
was
a
feedback
cycle
at
play
here
the
more
pills
he
took
the
less
equipped
he
was
to
judge
whether
he
taken
his
pills
so
the
more
pills
he
took
his
mind
meandered
through
a
solution
to
this
a
pillcase
that
reset
when
you
took
the
lid
off
and
chimed
if
you
took
the
lid
off
again
before
the
set
interval
had
elapsed
he
reached
for
his
comm
to
make
some
notes
found
it
wedged
under
one
of
his
hocks
greasy
with
sweat
batteries
dead
he
had
let
his
comm
run
down
in
a
decade
at
least
his
landlady
let
linda
in
on
the
fourth
day
as
he
was
sleeping
fitfully
with
a
pillow
over
his
face
to
shut
out
the
light
from
the
window
he
tried
to
draw
the
curtains
a
day
two
days
before
but
had
given
up
when
he
tried
to
pull
himself
upright
on
the
sill
only
to
collapse
in
a
fresh
gout
of
writhing
linda
crouched
by
his
head
and
stroked
his
greasy
hair
softly
until
he
flipped
the
pillow
off
his
face
with
a
movement
of
his
neck
he
squinted
up
at
her
impossibly
fresh
and
put
together
and
incongruous
in
his
world
of
reduced
circumstances
art
art
art
art
you
a
mess
art
jesus
why
are
you
in
bed
too
far
he
mumbled
what
would
your
grandmother
say
come
on
let
get
you
up
and
into
bed
and
then
i
going
to
have
a
doctor
and
a
massage
therapist
sent
in
you
need
a
nice
hot
bath
too
it
be
good
for
you
and
hygienic
besides
no
tub
he
said
petulantly
i
know
i
know
do
worry
about
it
i
sort
it
out
and
she
did
easing
him
to
his
feet
and
helping
him
into
bed
she
took
his
house
keys
and
disappeared
for
some
unknowable
time
then
reappeared
with
fresh
linen
in
store
wrappers
which
she
lay
on
the
bed
carefully
making
tight
hospital
corners
and
rolling
him
over
to
do
the
other
side
he
heard
her
clattering
in
the
kitchen
running
the
faucets
moving
furniture
he
reminded
himself
to
ask
her
to
drop
his
comm
in
its
charger
then
forgot
come
on
time
to
get
up
again
she
said
gently
peeling
the
sheets
back
it
ok
he
said
waving
weakly
at
her
yes
it
is
let
get
up
she
took
his
ankles
and
gradually
turned
him
on
the
bed
so
that
his
feet
were
on
the
floor
then
grabbed
him
by
his
stinking
armpits
and
helped
him
to
his
feet
he
stumbled
with
her
into
his
crowded
living
room
dimly
aware
of
the
furniture
stacked
on
itself
around
him
she
left
him
hanging
on
the
door
lintel
and
then
began
removing
his
clothes
she
actually
used
a
scissors
to
cut
away
his
stained
tee
shirt
and
boxer
shorts
all
right
she
said
into
the
tub
no
tub
he
said
look
down
art
she
said
he
did
an
inflatable
wading
pool
sat
in
the
middle
of
his
living
room
flanked
by
an
upended
coffee
table
and
his
sofa
standing
on
its
ear
the
pool
was
full
of
steaming
cloudy
water
there
a
bunch
of
eucalyptus
oil
and
epsom
salts
in
there
you
gon
na
love
it
that
night
art
actually
tottered
into
the
kitchen
and
got
himself
a
glass
of
water
one
hand
pressed
on
his
lower
back
the
cool
air
of
the
apartment
fanned
the
mentholated
liniment
on
his
back
and
puckered
goose
pimples
all
over
his
body
after
days
of
leaden
limbs
he
felt
light
and
clean
his
senses
singing
as
though
he
was
emerging
from
a
fever
he
drank
the
water
and
retrieved
his
comm
from
its
cradle
he
propped
several
pillows
up
on
his
headboard
and
fired
up
his
comm
immediately
it
began
to
buzz
and
hum
and
chatter
and
blink
throwing
up
alerts
about
urgent
messages
pages
and
calls
pending
the
lightness
he
felt
fled
him
and
he
began
the
rotten
business
of
triaging
his
one
strong
impression
emerged
almost
immediately
fede
wanted
him
in
boston
the
jersey
clients
were
interested
in
the
teasers
that
fede
had
forwarded
to
them
the
jersey
clients
were
obsessed
with
the
teasers
that
fede
had
forwarded
to
them
the
jersey
clients
were
howling
for
more
after
the
teasers
that
fede
had
forwarded
to
them
fede
had
negotiated
some
big
bucks
on
approval
if
only
art
would
go
and
talk
to
the
jersey
clients
the
jersey
clients
had
arranged
a
meeting
with
some
of
the
masspike
for
the
following
week
and
now
they
were
panicking
because
they
did
have

forwarded
to
them

really
try
to
go

at
him

change
of
scenery

goddamned
idiot

know
that
art
knew

he
also
knew
that

an
opportunity
to

to
make
a
good
impression
on
the
jersey
clients
to
make
his
name
in
the
tribe
and

bundle

said
and
tossed
aside
the
covers
but
i
do
have
to
sit
around
watching
you
ruin
it
she
disappeared
into
the
hallway
then
reemerged
dressed
and
with
her
coat
on
i
out
of
here
linda
art
said

she
said

new
york
maybe
another
up
to
toronto
and
a
roti
at
one
of
the
halal
guyanese
places
on
queen
street
he
levered
himself
painfully
out
of
bed
and
hobbled
to
the
living
room
where
linda
was
arguing
with
a
taxi
dispatcher
over
her
comm
trying
to
get
them
to
send
out
a
cab
at
two
in
the
morning

on
ranting
down
the
comm
at
the
dispatcher
linda

said

mouthpiece

fuck

she
uncovered
the
mouthpiece
hello
hello
the
dispatcher
had
hung
up
she
snapped
the
comm
shut
and
slammed
it
into
her
purse
she
whirled
to
face
art
snorting
angry
breaths
through
her
nostrils
her
face
was
such
a
mask
of
rage
that
art
recoiled
and
his
back
twinged
he
clasped
at
it
and
carefully
lowered
himself
onto
the
sofa
do
do
this
ok
he
said
i
need
support
not
haranguing
what
there
to
say
your
mind
already
made
up

to
go
off
and
be

can
sort
this
out
and
actually
you
know
come
to
understand
each
other
point
of
view
fine
she
said
and
slammed
herself
into
the
sofa
art
bounced
and
he
seized
his
back
reflexively
waiting
for
the
pain
but
beyond
a
throbbing
he
was
i
have
a
very
large
opportunity
in
boston
right
now
one
that
could
really
change
my
life
money
sure
but
prestige
and
profile
too
a
dream
of
an
opportunity
i
need
to
attend
one
or
two
meetings
and
then
i
can
take
a
couple
days
off
i
get
fede
to
ok
a
flight
we
get
chits
we
can
use
to
upgrade
to
virgin
upper
they

hot
tubs
and
massage
therapists
now
check
into
a
spa
they
got
a
bunch
on
route
and
get
a
massage
every
morning
and
have
a
physiotherapist
up
to
the
room
every
night
i
ca
afford
that
stuff
here
but
fede
spring
for
it
if
i
go
to
boston
let
me
expense
it
i
be
a
good
lad
i
promise
i
still
think
you
being
an
idiot
why
ca
fede
go
because
it
my
deal
why
ca
whoever
you
meeting
with
come
here
that
complicated
bullshit
i
thought
you
wanted
to
talk
about
this
i
do
i
just
ca
talk
about
that
part
why
not
are
you
afraid
i
blab
christ
art
give
me
some
credit
who
the
hell
would
i
blab
anyway
look
linda
the
deal
itself
is
confidential
a
secret
a
secret
only
a
secret
if
you
do
tell
it
to
anyone
all
right
so
i
not
going
to
tell
you
it
not
relevant
to
the
discussion
anyway
art
art
art
art
you
make
it
all
sound
so
reasonable
and
you
can
dress
it
up
with
whatever
words
you
want
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
both
know
full
of
shit
on
this
there
no
that
doing
this
is
better
for
you
than
staying
here
in
bed
if
fede
the
problem
let
me
talk
to
him
jesus
no
why
not
it
not
appropriate
linda
this
is
a
issue
it
would
be
professional
ok
i
concede
that
flying
and
going
to
meeting
is
more
stressful
than
not
flying
and
not
going
to
meetings
but
let
take
it
as
a
given
that
i
need
to
go
to
boston
ca
we
agree
on
that
and
then
discuss
the
ways
that
we
can
mitigate
the
risks
associated
with
the
trip
jesus
you
an
idiot
she
said
but
she
seemed
to
be
on
the
verge
of
smiling
but
i
idiot
right
art
said
hopefully
sure
sure
you
are
she
smile
then
and
cuddle
up
to
him
on
the
sofa
they
do
have
fucking
in
virgin
upper
do
they
yeah
art
said
kissing
her
earlobe
they
really
do
once
the
blood
coursing
from
my
shins
slows
and
clots
i
take
an
opportunity
to
inspect
the
damage
more
closely
the
cuts
are
relatively
shallow
certainly
less
serious
than
they
were
in
my
runamuck
imagination
which
had
vivid
slashes
of
white
bone
visible
through
the
divided
skin
i
cautiously
pick
out
the
larger
grit
and
gravel
and
turn
my
attention
spinewards
i
have
done
a
number
on
my
back
that
much
is
certain
my
old
friends
the
sacroiliac
joints
feel
as
tight
as
drumheads
and
they
creak
ominously
when
i
shift
to
a
sitting
position
with
my
back
propped
up
on
the
chimney
upended
butt
the
aluminum
skirting
cool
as
a
kiss
on
my
skin
they
only
just
starting
to
twinge
a
hint
of
the
agonies
to
come
my
jaw
though
is
pretty
bad
my
whole
face
feels
swollen
and
if
i
open
my
mouth
the
blood
starts
anew
you
know
on
sober
reflection
i
believe
that
coming
up
to
the
roof
was
a
really
bad
idea
i
use
the
chimney
to
lever
myself
upright
again
and
circle
it
to
see
exactly
what
kind
of
damage
i
done
there
a
neat
circular
hole
in
the
roof
where
the
chimney
used
to
be
gusting
warm
air
into
my
face
as
i
peer
into
its
depths
the
hole
is
the
mouth
of
a
piece
of
shiny
metal
conduit
about
the
circumference
of
a
basketball
hoop
when
i
put
my
head
into
it
i
hear
the
white
noise
of
a
fan
somewhere
below
in
the
building
attic
i
toss
some
gravel
down
the
conduit
and
listen
to
the
report
as
it
off
the
fan
blades
down
below
that
a
good
loud
sound
and
one
that
is
certain
to
echo
through
the
building
i
rain
gravel
down
the
exhaust
tube
by
the
handful
getting
into
a
mindless
shuffling
rhythm
wearing
the
sides
of
my
hands
raw
and
red
as
i
scrape
the
pebbles
up
into
handy
piles
soon
i
am
shuffling
afield
of
the
fallen
chimney
one
hand
on
my
lumbar
crouched
over
like
a
chimp
knees
splayed
in
an
effort
to
shift
stress
away
from
my
grooved
calves
i
really
beating
the
shit
out
of
that
poor
fan
i
can
tell
the
rattle
of
the
gravel
ricocheting
off
the
blades
is
dulling
now
sometimes
followed
by
secondary
rattles
as
the
pebbles
bounce
back
into
the
blades
not
sure
what
i
do
if
the
fan
gives
out
before
someone
notices
me
up
here
it
not
an
issue
as
it
turns
out
the
heavy
fire
door
beyond
the
chimney
swings
open
abruptly
a
hospital
maintenance
gal
in
coveralls
and
draped
with
tool
belts
and
bandoliers
she
from
the
trek
up
the
stairs
and
it
gives
her
the
aspect
of
a
fairy
tale
baker
or
she
reinforces
this
impression
by
putting
her
plump
hands
to
her
enormous
bosom
and
gasping
when
she
catches
sight
of
me
it
comes
to
me
that
i
am
quite
a
fucking
sight
bloody
sunburnt
with
my
simian
hunch
and
my
scabby
jaw
set
at
a
crazy
angle
to
my
face
and
reality
both
not
to
mention
my
near
nudity
which
i
semipositive
is
not
her
idea
of
light
entertainment
hey
i
say
i
uh
i
got
stuck
on
the
roof
the
door
shut
talking
reopens
the
wound
on
my
jaw
and
i
feel
more
blood
trickling
down
my
neck
unfortunately
i
only
get
one
chance
to
make
a
first
impression
huh
i
not
you
know
really
i
was
just
a
little
bored
and
so
i
went
exploring
and
got
stuck
and
tried
to
get
someone
attention
had
a
couple
accidents
it
a
long
story
hey
my
name
art
what
yours
oh
my
lord
she
said
and
her
hand
jumps
to
the
hammer
in
its
bandolier
holster
on
her
round
tummy
she
claws
at
it
frantically
please
i
say
holding
my
hands
in
front
of
me
please
i
hurt
is
all
i
came
up
here
to
get
some
fresh
air
and
the
door
swung
shut
behind
me
i
tripped
when
i
knocked
over
the
chimney
to
get
someone
attention
i
not
dangerous
please
just
help
me
get
back
down
to
the
twentieth
floor
i
think
i
might
need
a
stretcher
crew
my
back
is
pretty
bad
it
caitlin
she
says
i
beg
your
pardon
my
name
is
caitlin
she
says
hi
caitlin
i
said
i
extend
my
hand
but
she
does
move
the
ten
yards
she
would
have
to
cross
in
order
to
take
it
i
think
about
moving
towards
her
but
think
better
of
it
you
not
up
here
to
jump
are
you
jump
christ
no
just
stuck
is
all
just
stuck
linda
goddamned
boyfriend
was
into
all
this
flaky
getting
to
yes
shit
subliminal
means
of
establishing
rapport
and
so
on
linda
and
i
once
spent
an
afternoon
at
the
children
carousel
uptown
in
manhattan
making
fun
of
all
his
newage
theories
the
one
that
stood
out
in
my
mind
as
funniest
was
synching
your
breathing
what
you
resist
persists
so
you
need
to
turn
resistance
into
assistance
linda
recounted
you
match
breathing
with
your
subject
for
fifteen
breaths
and
they
unconsciously
become
receptive
to
your
suggestions
i
have
a
suspicion
that
caitlin
might
bolt
duck
back
through
the
door
and
pound
down
the
stairs
on
her
chubby
little
legs
and
leave
me
stranded
so
i
try
it
match
my
breath
to
her
heaving
bosom
she
still
panting
from
her
trek
up
the
stairs
and
fifteen
breaths
go
by
in
a
quick
pause
the
silence
stretches
and
i
try
to
remember
what
i
supposed
to
do
next
lead
the
subject
that
it
i
slow
my
breathing
down
gradually
and
amazingly
her
breath
slows
down
along
with
mine
until
we
both
breathing
great
slow
breaths
it
works
it
flaky
and
goofy
california
shit
but
it
works
caitlin
i
say
calmly
making
it
part
of
an
exhalation
yes
she
says
still
wary
have
you
got
a
comm
i
do
yes
can
you
please
call
downstairs
and
ask
them
to
send
up
a
stretcher
crew
hurt
my
back
and
i
wo
be
able
to
handle
the
stairs
i
can
do
that
yes
thank
you
caitlin
it
feels
like
cheating
i
did
have
to
browbeat
her
or
puncture
her
bad
reasoning
all
it
took
was
a
little
rapport
a
little
putting
myself
in
her
shoes
i
ca
believe
it
worked
but
caitlin
flips
a
ruggedized
comm
off
her
hip
and
speaks
into
it
in
a
calm
efficient
manner
thank
you
caitlin
i
say
again
i
start
to
ease
myself
to
a
sitting
position
and
my
back
gives
way
so
that
i
crash
to
the
rooftop
mewling
hands
clutched
to
my
spasming
lumbar
and
then
caitlin
at
my
side
pushing
my
hands
away
from
my
back
strong
thumbs
digging
into
the
spasming
muscles
around
my
iliac
crests
soothing
and
smoothing
them
out
tracing
the
lines
of
fire
back
to
the
nodes
of
the
joints
patiently
kneading
the
spasms
out
until
the
pain
recedes
to
a
soft
throbbing
my
old
man
used
to
get
that
she
said
all
us
kids
had
to
take
turns
working
it
out
for
him
i
on
my
back
staring
up
over
her
curves
and
rolls
and
into
her
earnest
freckled
face
oh
god
that
feels
good
i
say
that
what
the
old
man
used
to
say
you
too
young
to
have
a
bad
back
i
have
to
agree
i
say
all
right
i
going
to
prop
your
knees
up
and
lay
your
head
down
i
need
to
have
a
look
at
that
ventilator
i
grimace
i
afraid
i
did
a
real
number
on
it
i
say
sorry
about
that
she
waves
a
chubby
at
me
with
her
freckled
hand
and
walks
over
to
the
chimney
leaving
me
staring
at
the
sky
knees
bent
waiting
for
the
stretcher
crew
when
they
arrive
caitlin
watches
as
they
strap
me
onto
the
board
tying
me
tighter
than
is
strictly
necessary
for
my
safety
and
i
realize
that
i
not
being
tied
i
being
tied
thanks
caitlin
i
say
you
welcome
art
good
luck
with
the
ventilator
sorry
again
that
all
right
kid
it
my
job
after
all
virgin
upper
hot
tubs
were
more
theoretically
soothing
than
actually
so
they
had
rather
high
walls
and
a
rather
low
water
level
both
for
modesty
sake
and
to
prevent
spills
art
passed
through
the
miniature
and
into
the
tub
after
his
massage
somewhere
over
newfoundland
and
just
as
the
plane
hit
turbulence
buffeting
him
with
chlorinated
water
that
stung
his
eyes
and
got
up
his
nose
and
soaked
the
magazine
on
offshore
investing
that
he
found
in
the
back
of
his
seat
pocket
he
landed
at
jfk
still
smelling
of
chlorine
and
sandalwood
massage
oil
and
the
lotion
in
the
fancy
toilets
tension
melted
away
from
him
as
he
meandered
to
the
shuttle
stop
the
air
had
an
indefinable
character
of
homeliness
or
maybe
it
was
the
sunlight
amateur
tribal
anthropologists
were
always
thrashing
about
light
among
themselves
arguing
about
the
sun
character
varying
from
latitude
to
latitude
filtered
through
this
city
pollution
signature
or
that
the
light
or
the
air
the
latitude
or
the
smog
it
felt
like
home
the
women
walked
with
a
reassuring
confident
clack
of
heel
on
hard
tile
the
men
talked
louder
than
was
necessary
to
one
another
or
to
their
comms
the
people
were
a
riot
of
ethnicities
and
their
speech
was
a
riotous
babel
of
accents
idioms
and
languages
aggressive
pretzel
vendors
vied
with
aggressive
panhandlers
to
shake
down
the
people
waiting
on
the
shuttle
bus
art
bought
a
stale
pretzel
that
was
crusted
with
inedible
volumes
of
yellowing
salt
and
squirted
a
couple
bucks
at
a
panhandler
who
had
been
pestering
him
in
thick
jamaican
patois
but
thanked
him
in
adenoidal
brooklynese
by
the
time
he
boarded
his
connection
to
logan
he
was
joggling
his
knees
uncontrollably
in
his
seat
his
delight
barely
contained
he
got
an
undrinkable
can
of
watery
budweiser
and
propped
it
up
on
his
tray
table
alongside
his
inedible
pretzel
and
arranged
them
in
a
kind
of
symbolic
tableau
of
all
things
estian
he
commed
fede
from
the
guts
of
the
tunnels
that
honeycombed
boston
realizing
with
a
thrill
as
fede
picked
up
that
it
was
two
in
the
morning
in
london
at
the
nominal
while
here
at
at
the
default
time
zone
of
his
life
livelihood
and
lifestyle
it
was
only
fede
art
said
into
the
comm
hey
art
fede
said
with
a
false
air
of
chipperness
that
art
recognized
from
any
number
of
calls
there
was
a
cheap
malaysian
comm
that
he
once
bought
because
of
its
hyped
up
feature
its
ability
to
go
from
its
deepest
sleepmode
to
full
waking
glory
without
the
customary
thirty
seconds
of
housekeeping
as
it
reestablished
its
network
connection
verified
its
file
system
and
memory
and
pinged
its
for
state
and
presence
info
this
malaysian
comm
the
crackler
had
the
uncanny
ability
to
go
into
suspended
animation
indefinitely
and
yet
throw
your
workspace
back
on
its
display
in
a
hot
instant
when
art
actually
laid
hands
on
it
after
it
meandered
its
way
across
the
world
by
slow
boat
corrupt
posts
and
telegraphs
authorities
courier
services
and
revenue
canada
customs
agents
he
was
enchanted
by
this
feature
he
could
put
the
device
into
deep
sleep
close
it
up
and
pop
its
cover
open
and
poof
there
were
his
windows
it
took
him
three
days
and
an
interesting
crash
to
notice
that
even
though
he
was
seeing
his
workspace
he
was
able
to
interact
with
it
for
thirty
seconds
the
auspicious
crash
revealed
the
presence
of
a
screenshot
of
his
workspace
on
the
drive
and
he
realized
that
the
machine
was
tricking
him
displaying
the
screenshot
the
illusion
of
wakefulness
when
he
woke
it
up
relying
on
the
illusion
to
endure
while
it
performed
its
housekeeping
tasks
in
the
background
a
little
stopwatch
work
proved
that
this
chicanery
actually
added
three
seconds
to
the
overall
and
taught
him
his
first
important
lesson
perception
of
functionality
trumps
the
actual
function
and
here
was
fede
throwing
up
a
verbal
screenshot
of
wakefulness
while
he
churned
in
the
background
housekeeping
himself
into
real
alertness
fede

word
shocked
him
they
never
mentioned
the
name
of
the
jersey
clients
it
started
as
a
game
but
soon
became
woven
into
fede
paranoid
procedures
now
they
had
reached
the
endgame
within
a
matter
of
weeks
they
be
turning
in
their
resignations
to
and
taking
the
final
flight
across
the
atlantic
and

tomorrow
afternoon
we
starting
late
to
give
me
time
to
get
a
full
sleep
the
last
conference
call
with
perceptronics
had
gone
fantastically
his
normal
handlers
sour
men
with
nasty
minds
who
glommed
onto
irrelevancies
in
strategy
and
teased
at
them
until
they
conjured
up
shadowy
and
shrewd
conspiracies
where
none
existed
were
on
that
call
instead
he
spent
a
rollicking
four
hours
on
the
line
with
the
sharp
and
snarky
product
designers
and
engineers
bouncing
ideas
back
and
forth
at
speed
even
over
the
phone
the
homey
voices
and
points
of
view
felt
indefinably
comfortable
and
familiar
they
been
delighted
to
start
late
in
the
day
for
his
benefit
and
had
offered
to
work
late
and
follow
up
with
a
visit
to
a
bar
where
he
could
get
a
burger
the
size
of
a
baby
head
we

and
the
day

fede
art
rang
off
feeling
exhausted
and
aggravated
he
followed
the
tunnel
signs
to
the
nearest
wanting
to
get
into
the
sunlight
and
architecture
and
warm
himself
with
both
a
miniscule
bmw
flea
blatted
its
horn
at
him
when
he
changed
lanes
had
he
cut
the
car
off
he
was
still
looking
the
wrong
way
still
anticipating
oncoming
traffic
on
the
right
he
raised
a
hand
in
an
apologetic
wave
it
was
enough
for
the
flea
driver
the
car
ran
right
up
to
his
bumper
then
zipped
into
the
adjacent
lane
accelerated
and
cut
him
off
nearly
causing
a
wreck
as
it
was
art
had
to
swerve
into
the
parking
lane
on
mass
ave
how
did
he
get
to
mass
ave
god
he
was
lost
already
to
avoid
him
the
flea
backed
off
and
switched
lanes
again
then
pulled
up
alongside
of
him
the
driver
rolled
down
his
window
how
the
fuck
do
you
like
it
jackoff
do
fucking
cut
me
off
he
was
a
middle
aged
white
guy
in
a
suit
driving
a
car
that
was
worth
a
year
wages
to
art
and
art
felt
something
give
way
inside
and
then
he
was
shouting
back
when
i
want
your
opinion
i
squeeze
your
fucking
head
you
sack
of
shit
as
it
is
i
can
barely
contain
my
rage
at
the
thought
that
a
scumbag
like
you
is
consuming
that
the
rest
of
us
could
be
breathing
now
roll
up
your
goddamned
window
and
drive
your
fucking
before
i
smash
your
fucking
head
in
he
shut
his
mouth
alarmed
what
the
hell
was
he
saying
how
did
he
end
up
standing
here
outside
of
his
car
shouting
at
the
other
driver
stalking
towards
the
flea
with
his
hands
balled
into
fists
why
was
he
picking
a
fight
with
this
goddamned
psycho
anyway
a
year
in
peaceful
london
had
eased
his
normal
defense
systems
now
they
came
up
full
and
he
wondered
if
the
he
just
snapped
at
would
haul
out
a
special
and
cap
him
but
the
other
driver
looked
as
shocked
as
art
felt
he
rolled
up
his
window
and
sped
off
turning
wildly
at
the
next
corner
brookline
art
saw
art
got
back
into
his
rental
pulled
off
to
the
curb
and
asked
his
comm
to
generate
an
optimal
route
to
his
hotel
and
drove
in
numb
silence
the
rest
of
the
way
they
let
me
call
gran

my
second
day

course
linda
had
already
called
her

briefed

about
gran
seeing
me
in
the
ward
amidst
the
pukers
and
the
screamers
and
the
droolers
and
the
and
flinched
away
from
the
phone
but
if
you
going
to
come
down
come
for
the
hearing
at
the
end
of
the
week
there
nothing
you
can
do
here
now
even
if
i
ca
help
i
just
want
to
come
and
see
you
it
was
so
nice
when
you
were
here
i
know
i
know
i
be
coming
back
soon
do
worry
if
only
gran
could
see
me
now
on
the
infirmary
examination
table
in
restraint
good
thing
she
ca
a
doctor
looms
over
me
how
are
you
feeling
art
i
had
better
days
i
say
with
what
i
hope
is
stark
sanity
and
humor
are
crazy
people
incapable
of
humor
i
went
for
a
walk
and
the
door
swung
shut
behind
me
well
they
do
that
the
doctor
says
my
name
is
szandor
he
says
and
shakes
my
hand
in
its
restraint
a
pleasure
to
meet
you
i
say
you
a
doctor
are
you
an
md
yup
there
a
couple
of
us
around
the
place
but
you
not
a
shrink
of
any
description
nope
how
you
guess
bedside
manner
you
did
patronize
me
szandor
tries
to
suppress
a
grin
then
gives
up
we
all
do
our
bit
he
says
how
you
get
up
on
the
roof
without
setting
off
your
room
alarm
anyway
if
i
tell
you
how
i
did
it
i
wo
be
able
to
repeat
the
trick
i
say
jokingly
he
swabbing
down
my
shins
now
with
something
that
stings
and
cools
at
the
same
time
from
time
to
time
he
takes
tweezers
in
hand
and
plucks
loose
some
gravel
or
grit
and
plinks
it
into
a
steel
tray
on
a
rolling
table
by
his
side
he
so
gentle
i
hardly
feel
it
what
you
never
heard
of
confidentiality
is
that
thing
still
around
oh
sure
we
had
a
mandatory
workshop
on
it
yesterday
afternoon
those
are
always
a
lot
of
fun
so
you
saying
that
you
got
professional
expertise
in
the
keeping
of
secrets
huh
i
suppose
i
could
spill
it
for
you
then
and
i
do
explaining
my
little
hack
for
tricking
the
door
into
thinking
that
i
left
and
returned
to
the
room
huh
now
that
you
explain
it
it
pretty
obvious
that
my
job
figuring
out
the
obvious
way
of
doing
something
and
we
fall
to
talking
about
my
job
with
and
the
discussion
branches
into
the
theory
and
practice
of
ue
only
slowing
a
little
when
he
picks
the
crud
out
of
the
scrape
down
my
jaw
and
tugs
through
a
couple
of
quick
stitches
it
occurs
to
me
that
he
just
keeping
me
distracted
using
a
highly
evolved
skill
for
placating
psychopaths
through
small
talk
so
that
they
do
thrash
while
knitting
their
bodies
back
together
i
decide
that
i
do
care
i
get
to
natter
on
about
a
subject
that
i
nearly
autistically
fixated
on
and
i
do
it
in
a
context
where
i
know
that
i
sane
and
smart
and
charming
and
occasionally
and
the
whole
thing
pays
for
itself
through
ezpass
where
we
collect
the
payments
for
the
music
downloaded
while
you
on
the
road
as
i
finish
my
spiel
i
realize
been
keeping
distracted
standing
there
with
the
tweezers
in
one
hand
and
a
swab
in
the
other
wow
he
said
so
when
this
all
going
to
happen
you
use
it
huh
hell
yeah
i
got
a
good
twenty
thirty
thousand
on
my
car
right
now
saying
i
could
plunder
anyone
else
stereo
at
will
for
free
and
keep
it
while
i
stuck
in
traffic
and
because
i
a
what
you
call
it
a
a
it
all
free
and
legal
damn
well
it
may
be
a
while
before
you
see
it
on
the
east
coast
it
probably
roll
out
in
la
first
then
san
francisco
seattle
what
why
it
a
long
story
i
say
and
it
ends
with
me
on
the
roof
of
a
goddamned
nuthouse
on
route
doing
a
tribute
to
the
three
stooges
three
days
later
art
finally
realized
that
something
big
and
ugly
was
in
the
offing
fede
had
repeatedly
talked
him
out
of
going
to
perceptronics
offices
offering
increasingly
flimsy
excuses
and
distracting
him
by
calling
the
front
desk
and
sending
up
surprise
massage
therapists
to
interrupt
art
as
he
stewed
in
his
juices
throbbing
with
resentment
at
having
been
flown
thousands
of
klicks
while
injured
in
order
to
check
into
a
faceless
hotel
on
a
faceless
stretch
of
highway
and
insert
this
thumb
into
his
asshole
and
wait
for
fede
was
still
in
fucking
london
to
sort
out
the
mess
so
that
he
could
present
himself
at
the
perceptronics
acton
offices
and
get
their
guys
prepped
for
the
meeting
with
masspike
jesus
federico
what
the
fuck
am
i
here
i
know
art
i
know
art
had
taken
to
calling
fede
at
the
extreme
ends
of
circadian
compatibility
three
am
and
eleven
pm
and
then
noon
on
fede
clock
as
a
subtle
means
of
making
the
experience
just
as
unpleasant
for
fede
as
it
was
for
art
i
screwed
up
fede
yawned
i
screwed
up
and
now
we
both
paying
the
price
you
handled
your
end
beautifully
and
i
dropped
mine
and
i
intend
to
make
it
up
to
you
i
do
more
massages
fede
i
want
to
get
this
shit
done
and
i
want
to
come
home
and
see
my
girlfriend
fede
tittered
over
the
phone
what
so
funny
nothing
much
fede
said
just
sit
tight
there
for
a
couple
minutes
ok
call
me
back
once
it
happens
and
tell
me
what
you
wan
na
do
all
right
once
what
happens
you
know
it
was
linda
of
course
knocking
on
art
hotel
room
door
minutes
later
throwing
her
arms
and
then
her
legs
around
him
and
banging
him
stupid
half
on
and
half
off
the
hotel
room
bed
riding
him
and
then
being
ridden
in
turns
slurping
and
wet
and
energetic
until
they
both
lay
sprawled
on
the
hotel
room
very
nice
persian
rugs
dehydrated
and
panting
and
art
commed
fede
and
fede
told
him
it
could
take
a
couple
weeks
to
sort
things
out
and
why
did
he
and
linda
rent
a
car
and
do
some
on
the
east
coast
that
exactly
what
they
did
starting
in
boston
where
they
cruised
cambridge
watching
the
cute
nerdyboys
and
geekygirls
wander
the
streets
having
heated
technical
debates
lugging
works
of
technology
and
art
through
the
sopping
summertime
a
riot
of
townie
accents
and
highbrow
engineerspeak
then
a
week
in
new
york
where
they
walked
until
they
thought
their
feet
would
give
out
entirely
necks
cricked
at
a
permanent
angle
to
gawp
at
the
topless
towers
of
manhattan
the
sound
the
sound
the
sound
of
manhattan
rang
in
their
ears
a
gray
and
deep
rumble
of
cars
and
footfalls
and
subways
and
steampipes
and
sirens
and
music
and
conversation
and
ring
tones
and
hucksters
and
schizophrenic
ranters
a
veritable
las
vegas
of
cacophony
and
it
made
linda
uncomfortable
she
who
was
raised
in
the
white
noise
susurrations
of
freeway
forests
but
it
made
art
feel
he
kept
his
comm
switched
off
though
the
underfoot
rumble
of
the
subway
had
him
reaching
for
it
a
hundred
times
a
day
convinced
that
he
left
it
on
in
mode
they
took
a
train
to
toronto
chuffing
through
sleepy
upstate
new
york
towns
past
lakes
and
rolling
countryside
in
full
summer
glory
art
and
linda
drank
ginger
beer
in
the
observation
car
spiking
it
with
rum
from
a
flask
that
linda
carried
in
a
garter
that
she
wore
for
the
express
purpose
of
being
able
to
reach
naughtily
up
her
little
sundress
and
produce
a
bottle
of
liquor
in
a
vessel
whose
shiny
sides
were
dulled
by
the
soft
oil
of
her
thigh
canada
customs
and
immigration
separated
them
at
the
border
sending
art
for
a
full
inspection
a
privilege
of
being
a
canadian
citizen
and
hence
perennially
under
suspicion
of
smuggling
goods
from
the
tax
havens
of
the
us
into
the
country
and
leaving
linda
in
their
little
pullman
cabin
when
art
popped
free
of
the
bureaucracy
his
life
thoroughly
peered
into
he
found
linda
standing
on
the
platform
leaning
against
a
pillar
back
arched
one
foot
flat
against
the
bricks
corresponding
dimpled
knee
exposed
to
the
restless
winds
of
the
trainyard
from
art
point
of
view
she
was
a
gleaming
vision
skewered
on
a
beam
of
late
day
sunlight
that
made
her
hair
gleam
like
licorice
her
long
and
lazy
jaw
caught
and
lost
the
sun
as
she
talked
animatedly
down
her
comm
and
art
was
struck
with
a
sudden
need
to
sneak
up
behind
her
and
run
his
tongue
down
the
line
that
began
with
the
knob
of
her
mandible
under
her
ear
and
ran
down
to
the
tiny
in
her
chin
to
skate
it
on
the
soft
pouch
of
flesh
under
her
chin
to
end
with
a
tasting
of
her
soft
lips
thought
became
deed
he
crept
up
on
her
smelling
her
hair
products
on
the
breeze
that
wafted
back
from
her
and
was
about
to
begin
his
tonguing
when
she
barked
fuck
stop
calling
me
and
closed
her
comm
and
stormed
off
trainwards
leaving
art
standing
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
pillar
with
a
thoroughly
wilted
romantic
urge
more
carefully
he
followed
her
into
the
train
back
to
their
little
cabin
and
reached
for
the
to
open
the
door
when
he
heard
her
agitated
comm
voice
no
goddamnit
no
not
yet
keep
calling
me
and
not
do
you
understand
art
opened
the
door
linda
was
composed
and
neat
and
sweet
in
her
plush
seat
shoulders
back
smile
winning
hey
honey
did
the
bad
customs
man
finally
let
you
go
he
did
that
sounded
like
a
doozy
of
a
phone
conversation
though
wrong
you
do
want
to
know
she
said
all
right
art
said
sitting
down
opposite
her
bending
forward
to
plant
a
kiss
on
the
top
of
her
exposed
thigh
i
do
good
he
continued
to
kiss
his
way
up
her
thigh
only
yes
i
think
i
probably
do
curiosity
is
one
of
my
worst
failings
of
character
really
quite
so
he
said
he
slid
her
sundress
right
up
to
the
waistband
of
her
cotton
drawers
and
now
he
worried
one
of
the
pubic
hairs
that
poked
out
from
the
elastic
with
his
teeth
she
shrieked
and
pushed
him
away
someone
will
see
she
said
this
is
a
border
crossing
not
a
bordello
he
sat
back
but
inserted
a
finger
in
the
elastic
before
linda
straightened
out
her
dress
so
that
his
fingertip
rested
in
the
crease
at
the
top
of
her
groin
you
are
she
said
and
curious
art
agreed
giving
his
fingertip
a
playful
wiggle
i
give
up
that
was
my
fucking
ex
she
said
that
is
how
i
will
refer
to
him
henceforth
fucking
ex
my
fucking
ex
my
fucking
ex
who
wants
to
have
the
talk
even
though
it
been
months
and
months
he
figured
out
that
i
stateside
from
my
calling
times
and
he
offering
to
come
out
to
meet
me
and
really
work
things
out
once
and
for
all
oh
my
art
said
that
boy
got
too
much
la
in
him
for
his
own
good
there
no
problem
that
ca
be
resolved
through
sufficient
dialog
we
never
really
talked
about
him
art
said
nope
we
sure
did
did
you
want
to
talk
about
him
now
linda
you
want
to
talk
about
him
now
linda
why
yes
art
i
would
how
perceptive
of
you
she
pushed
his
hand
away
and
crossed
her
arms
and
legs
simultaneously
wait
i
confused
art
said
does
that
mean
you
want
to
talk
about
him
or
that
you
do
fine
we
talk
about
him
what
do
you
want
to
know
about
my
fucking
ex
art
resisted
a
terrible
urge
to
fan
her
fires
to
return
the
vitriol
that
dripped
from
her
voice
look
you
do
want
to
talk
about
him
we
wo
talk
about
him
he
managed
no
let
talk
about
my
fucking
ex
by
all
means
she
adopted
a
singsong
tone
and
started
ticking
off
points
on
her
fingers
his
name
is
toby
he
about
your
height
your
dick
is
bigger
but
better
in
bed
he
a
designer
at
in
studio
city
he
never
fucking
shuts
up
about
what
wrong
with
this
or
that
we
dated
for
two
years
lived
together
for
one
year
and
broke
up
just
before
you
and
i
met
i
broke
it
off
with
him
he
was
making
me
goddamned
crazy
and
he
wanted
me
to
come
back
from
london
and
live
with
him
i
wanted
to
stay
out
the
year
in
england
and
go
back
to
my
own
apartment
and
possibly
a
different
boyfriend
and
he
made
me
choose
so
i
chose
is
that
enough
of
a
briefing
for
you
arthur
that
was
fine
art
said
linda
face
had
gone
rabid
purple
madly
pinched
spittle
flecking
off
of
her
lips
as
she
spat
out
the
words
thank
you
she
took
his
hands
and
kissed
the
knuckles
of
his
thumbs
look
i
do
like
to
talk
about
it
it
painful
i
sorry
he
ruining
our
holiday
i
just
take
his
calls
anymore
how
about
that
i
do
care
linda
honestly
i
do
give
a
rat
ass
if
you
want
to
chat
with
your
ex
i
just
saw
how
upset
you
were
and
i
thought
it
might
help
if
you
could
talk
it
over
with
me
i
know
baby
i
know
but
i
just
need
to
work
some
things
out
all
on
my
own
maybe
i
will
take
a
quick
trip
out
west
and
talk
things
over
with
him
you
could
come
if
you
want
there
are
some
wicked
bars
in
west
hollywood
that
ok
art
said
whipsawed
by
linda
incomprehensible
mood
shifts
but
if
you
need
to
go
go
i
got
plenty
of
old
pals
to
hang
out
with
in
toronto
you
so
understanding
she
cooed
tell
me
about
your
grandmother
again
you
sure
she
like
me
she
love
you
she
loves
anything
that
female
of
childbearing
years
and
in
my
company
she
has
great
and
unrealistic
hopes
of
cluck
cluck
just
practicing
my
doc
szandor
a
good
egg
he
keeping
the
shrinks
at
bay
spending
more
time
with
me
than
is
strictly
necessary
i
hope
he
is
neglecting
his
patients
but
it
been
so
long
since
i
had
a
normal
conversation
i
just
ca
bear
to
give
it
up
besides
i
get
the
impression
that
szandor
in
a
similar
pit
of
bad
conversation
with
psychopaths
and
psychotherapists
and
is
relieved
to
have
a
bit
of
a
natter
with
someone
who
is
either
having
hallucinations
or
attempting
to
prevent
them
in
others
how
the
hell
do
you
become
a
guy
sheer
orneriness
i
say
grinning
i
was
just
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
i
had
a
pal
in
new
york
who
was
working
for
a
biotech
company
that
had
made
this
artificial
erectile
tissue
erectile
tissue
yeah
synthetic
turtle
penis
small
and
pliable
and
capable
of
going
large
and
rigid
very
quickly
sounds
delightful
oh
it
was
actually
pretty
cool
you
know
the
joke
about
the
wallet
made
from
foreskins
sure
i
heard
it
premed
he
rubs
it
and
it
becomes
a
suitcase
right
that
the
one
so
these
guys
were
thinking
about
making
drawbridges
temporary
shelters
that
kind
of
thing
out
of
it
they
even
had
a
cute
name
for
it
ho
ho
ho
yeah
so
they
were
shipping
a
whole
lot
of
product
to
put
it
mildly
then
i
spent
a
couple
of
weeks
in
manhattan
housesitting
for
my
friend
while
he
was
visiting
his
folks
in
wisconsin
for
thanksgiving
he
had
a
ton
of
this
stuff
lying
around
his
apartment
and
i
would
come
back
after
walking
the
soles
off
my
shoes
and
sit
in
front
of
the
tube
playing
with
it
i
took
some
of
it
down
to
madison
square
park
and
played
with
it
there
i
liked
to
hang
out
there
because
it
was
always
full
of
these
very
cute
icelandic
and
their
tots
and
i
was
a
respectable
enough
young
man
with
about
words
of
icelandic
i
learned
from
a
friend
mom
in
high
school
and
they
thought
i
was
adorable
and
i
thought
they
were
blond
goddesses
i
gotten
to
be
friends
with
one
named
marta
oh
marta
bookmark
marta
szandor
and
i
come
back
to
her
once
we
better
acquainted
anyway
marta
was
in
charge
of
machinery
and
avarice
the
spoiled
monsterkinder
of
a
couple
of
bbd
o
senior
managers
who
vaulted
from
art
school
to
vpdom
in
one
year
when
most
of
the
gray
eminences
got
machinery
was
three
and
liked
to
bang
things
against
other
things
arythmically
while
hollering
atonally
avarice
was
five
not
toilet
trained
and
prone
to
tripping
i
get
marta
novelty
coffee
from
the
stinkbucks
on
and
we
drink
it
together
while
machinery
and
avarice
engaged
in
terrible
play
with
the
other
kids
in
the
park
i
showed
marta
what
i
had
though
i
was
tactful
enough
not
to
call
it
turtle
because
while
marta
was
earthy
she
was
earthy
and
truth
be
told
it
got
me
kinda
hot
to
watch
her
long
pale
blue
fingers
fondling
the
soft
tissue
then
triggering
the
circuit
that
hardened
it
then
machinery
comes
over
and
snatches
the
thing
away
from
marta
and
starts
pounding
on
avarice
taking
unholy
glee
in
the
way
the
stuff
alternately
softened
and
stiffened
as
he
squeezed
it
avarice
wrestled
it
away
from
him
and
tore
off
for
a
knot
of
kids
and
by
the
time
i
got
there
they
were
all
crowded
around
her
spellbound
i
caught
a
cab
back
to
my
buddy
apartment
and
grabbed
all
the
ardorite
i
could
lay
hands
on
and
brought
it
back
to
the
park
and
spent
the
next
couple
hours
running
an
impromptu
focus
group
watching
the
kids
and
their
bombshell
nannies
play
with
it
by
the
time
that
marta
touched
my
hand
with
her
long
cool
fingers
and
told
me
it
was
time
for
her
to
get
the
kids
home
for
their
nap
i
had
toy
ideas
about
eight
different
ways
to
use
the
stuff
for
clothing
fasteners
and
a
couple
of
miscellaneous
utility
uses
like
a
portable
crib
so
i
ran
it
down
for
my
pal
that
afternoon
over
the
phone
and
he
commed
his
boss
and
i
ended
up
eating
thanksgiving
dinner
at
his
boss
house
in
westchester
were
you
worried
he
rip
off
your
ideas
and
not
pay
you
anything
for
them
szandor
spellbound
by
the
story
unconsciously
unrolling
and
an
ace
bandage
did
even
cross
my
mind
of
course
he
tried
to
do
just
that
but
it
any
good
they
were
engineers
they
had
no
idea
how
normal
human
beings
interact
with
their
environments
the
stuff
was
they
added
a
million
cool
features
and
a
manual
an
inch
thick
after
prototyping
for
six
months
they
called
me
in
and
offered
me
a
royalty
on
any
products
i
designed
for
them
that
musta
been
worth
a
fortune
says
szandor
you
think
so
would
you
actually
they
folded
before
they
shipped
anything
blew
through
all
their
capital
on
r
d
did
have
anything
left
to
productize
their
tech
with
but
my
buddy
get
another
gig
with
a
company
that
was
working
on
new
kitchen
stuff
made
from
osmotic
materials
and
he
showed
them
the
stuff
i
done
with
the
ardorite
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
had
a
career
damn
that
cool
you
betcha
it
all
about
being
an
advocate
for
the
user
i
observe
what
users
do
and
how
they
do
it
figure
out
what
they
trying
to
do
and
then
boss
the
engineers
around
getting
them
to
remove
the
barriers
they
erected
because
engineers
are
all
basically
autistics
who
have
no
idea
how
normal
people
do
stuff
the
doctor
chuckles
look
he
says
producing
a
nicotine
pacifier
one
of
those
fake
cigs
that
gives
you
the
oral
fix
and
the
chemical
fix
and
the
habit
fix
without
the
noxious
smoke
it
not
my
area
of
specialty
but
you
seem
like
a
basically
sane
individual
modulo
your
rooftop
adventures
certainly
not
like
most
of
the
people
we
got
here
what
are
you
doing
here
doctor
szandor
is
young
younger
even
than
me
i
realize
maybe
i
can
see
some
fancy
poking
out
of
the
collar
of
his
shirt
see
some
telltale
remnant
of
a
fashionable
haircut
in
his
shag
he
got
to
be
the
youngest
staff
member
i
met
here
and
he
got
a
fundamentally
different
affect
from
the
zombies
in
the
lab
coats
who
maintain
the
zombies
in
the
felt
slippers
so
i
tell
him
my
story
the
highlights
anyway
the
more
i
tell
him
about
linda
and
fede
the
dumber
my
own
actions
sound
to
me
why
the
hell
did
you
stick
with
this
linda
anyway
szandor
says
sucking
on
his
pacifier
the
usual
reasons
i
guess
i
say
squirming
lem
me
tell
you
something
he
says
he
got
his
feet
up
on
the
table
now
hands
laced
behind
his
neck
it
the
smartest
thing
my
dad
ever
said
to
me
just
as
my
girl
and
me
were
breaking
up
before
i
went
away
to
med
school
she
was
nice
enough
but
you
know
i
gotten
to
the
point
where
i
ducked
and
ran
for
cover
every
time
she
disagreed
with
me
ready
for
her
to
lose
her
shit
so
my
dad
took
me
aside
put
his
arm
around
me
and
said
you
know
i
like
that
girlfriend
of
yours
but
she
is
crazy
not
a
little
crazy
really
crazy
maybe
she
wo
be
crazy
forever
but
if
she
gets
better
it
wo
be
because
of
you
trust
me
i
know
this
you
ca
fuck
a
crazy
girl
sane
son
i
ca
help
smiling
truer
words
i
say
but
harsh
harsh
is
relative
he
says
contrast
it
with
say
getting
someone
committed
on
evidence
it
dawns
on
me
that
doc
szandor
believes
me
it
dawns
on
me
that
you
believe
me
he
gnaws
fitfully
at
his
pacifier
well
why
not
you
not
any
crazier
than
i
am
that
much
is
clear
to
me
you
have
neat
ideas
your
story
plausible
enough
i
get
excited
is
this
your
opinion
sorry
no
i
am
not
a
mental
health
professional
so
i
do
have
professional
opinions
on
your
mental
health
it
is
however
my
amateur
opinion
oh
well
so
where
are
you
at
now
the
hospital
well
they
do
tell
me
much
but
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
i
am
stuck
here
semipermanently
the
court
found
me
incompetent
and
ordered
me
held
until
i
was
i
ca
get
anyone
to
explain
what
competency
consists
of
or
how
i
achieve
it
when
i
try
i
get
accused
of
being
of
course
escaping
onto
the
roof
is
a
little
beyond
difficult
i
have
a
feeling
i
going
to
be
in
pretty
deep
shit
do
they
know
about
the
car
the
car
in
the
parking
lot
the
one
that
blew
up
doc
szandor
laughs
hard
enough
that
his
pacifier
shoots
across
the
room
and
lands
in
a
hazmat
bucket
you
son
of
a
bitch
that
was
you
yeah
i
say
and
drum
my
feet
against
the
tin
cupboards
under
the
examination
table
that
was
fucking
oh
christ
i
sorry
i
say
god
no
no
no
he
says
fishing
in
his
pocket
and
unwrapping
a
fresh
pacifier
it
insurance
i
getting
a
bike
vroom
vroom
what
a
coincidence
though
he
says
coincidence
he
making
disgusting
noises
grinding
away
at
his
pacifier
szandor
do
you
sometimes
sneak
out
onto
the
landing
to
have
a
cigarette
use
a
bit
of
tinfoil
for
your
ashtray
prop
the
door
open
behind
you
why
do
you
ask
that
how
i
got
out
onto
the
roof
oh
shit
he
says
it
our
secret
i
say
i
can
tell
them
i
do
know
how
i
got
out
incompetent
remember
you
a
good
egg
art
he
says
how
the
hell
are
we
going
to
get
you
out
of
here
hey
what
no
really
there
no
good
reason
for
you
to
be
here
right
you
occupying
valuable
bed
space
well
i
appreciate
the
sentiment
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
as
soon
as
you
turn
me
loose
i
gon
na
be
doped
up
to
the
tits
for
a
good
long
while
he
grimaces
right
right
they
like
their
meds
are
your
parents
alive
what
no
they
both
dead
aha
died
suddenly
yeah
dad
drowned
mom
fell
ah
ah
ah
shhh
mom
died
suddenly
she
was
taking
haldol
when
it
happened
a
low
antianxiety
dose
right
huh
probably
she
was
probably
she
had
a
terrible
drug
interaction
sudden
death
syndrome
it
hereditary
and
you
say
she
fell
seizure
we
sign
you
up
for
a
pet
scan
that
take
at
least
a
month
to
set
up
you
could
be
an
epileptic
and
not
even
know
it
shaking
the
radioisotopes
loose
for
the
scan
from
the
aec
woah
that
a
week
worth
of
paperwork
right
there
no
thorazine
for
you
young
man
not
until
we
absolutely
sure
it
wo
kill
you
dead
where
you
stand
the
hospital
counsel
gave
us
all
a
very
stern
lecture
on
this
very
subject
not
a
month
ago
i
just
make
some
notes
in
your
medical
history
he
picked
up
his
comm
and
scribbled
never
woulda
thought
of
that
i
say
i
impressed
it
something
i
been
playing
with
for
a
while
now
i
think
that
psychiatric
care
is
a
good
thing
of
course
but
it
could
be
better
implemented
taking
away
prescription
pads
would
be
a
good
start
or
you
could
keep
public
stats
on
which
doctors
had
prescribed
how
much
of
what
and
how
often
put
on
a
chart
in
the
ward
where
the
patients
families
could
see
that
he
says
i
love
it
we
supposed
to
be
accountable
right
what
else
give
the
patients
a
good
reason
to
wear
their
tracking
bracelets
redesign
them
so
they
gather
stats
on
mobility
and
vitals
and
track
them
against
your
meds
and
other
therapies
create
a
dating
service
that
automatically
links
patients
who
respond
similarly
to
therapies
so
they
can
compare
notes
ooh
by
comparing
with
location
data
from
other
trackers
you
could
get
stats
on
which
therapies
make
people
more
sociable
just
by
counting
the
frequency
with
which
patients
stop
and
spend
time
in
proximity
to
other
patients
it
give
you
empirical
data
with
which
you
track
your
own
progress
this
is
great
stuff
damn
how
do
you
do
that
i
feel
a
familiar
swelling
of
pride
i
like
it
when
people
understand
how
good
i
am
at
my
job
working
at
was
hard
on
my
ego
after
all
my
job
there
was
to
do
a
perfectly
rotten
job
to
design
the
worst
user
experiences
that
plausibility
would
allow
god
did
i
really
do
that
for
two
whole
goddamned
years
it
my
job
i
say
and
give
a
modest
shrug
what
do
you
charge
for
work
like
that
why
are
you
in
the
market
who
knows
maybe
after
i
figure
out
how
to
spring
you
we
can
go
into
biz
together
redesigning
nuthatches
linda
first
meeting
with
art
gran
went
off
without
a
hitch
gran
met
them
at
union
station
with
an
obsolete
red
cap
who
was
as
ancient
as
she
was
a
vestige
of
a
more
genteel
era
of
train
travel
and
bulky
luggage
just
seeing
him
made
art
brain
whir
with
plans
for
conveyor
systems
luggage
escalators
cart
dispensers
they
barely
had
enough
luggage
between
the
two
of
them
to
make
it
worth
the
old
man
time
but
he
dutifully
marked
their
bags
with
a
stub
of
chalk
and
hauled
them
onto
his
cart
then
trundled
off
to
the
service
elevators
gran
gave
art
a
long
and
teary
hug
she
was
less
frail
than
she
been
in
his
memory
taller
and
sturdier
the
smell
of
her
powder
and
the
familiar
acoustics
of
union
station
cavernous
platform
whirled
him
back
to
his
childhood
in
toronto
to
the
homey
time
before
he
gotten
on
the
circadian
gran
this
is
linda
he
said
oh
it
so
to
meet
you
gran
said
taking
linda
hands
in
hers

smiled
a
great
pretty
toothy
smile
julie
art
told
me
all
about
you
i
just
we
be
great
friends
i
sure
we
will
are
you
hungry
did
they
feed
you
on
the
train
you
must
be
exhausted
after
such
a
long
trip
which
would
you
rather
do
first
eat
or
rest
well
up
for
seeing
the
town
linda
said
your
grandson
been
yawning
his
head
off
since
buffalo
though
she
put
her
arm
around
his
waist
and
squeezed
his
tummy
what
a
fantastic
couple
you
make
gran
said
you
did
tell
me
she

she
going
to
ask

gran
said
cuffing
him
gently
upside
the
head

always
exaggerating
well

a
splendid
idea
linda
said
shall

have
two
three
four

it
ten
art
said
kissing
her
cheek
oh

nice
compromise

julie
if

a
girl
or
julius
if
it
a
boy
oh

going
to
get

gran
said
and
led
them
up
to
the
curb
where
the
red
cap
had
loaded
their
bags
into
a
cab
they
ate
dinner
at
lindy
on
yonge
street
right
in
the
middle
of
the
sleaze
strip
the
steakhouse
had
been
there
for
the
better
part
of
a
century
and
its
cracked
booths
and
thick
rib
eyes
smothered
in
horseradish
and
hp
sauce
were
just
as
art
had
remembered
riding
up
yonge
street
the
city
lights
had
seemed
charming
and
understated
even
the
porn
marquees
felt
restrained
after
a
week
in
new
york
art
ate
a
steak
as
big
as
his
head
and
fell
into
a
postprandial
torpor
whence
he
emerged
only
briefly
to
essay
a
satisfied
belch
meanwhile
gran
and
linda
nattered
away
like
old
friends
making
plans
for
the
week
the
zoo
the
island
a
day
trip
to
niagara
falls
a
ride
up
the
cn
tower
all
the
touristy
stuff
that
art
had
last
done
in
elementary
school
by
the
time
art
lay
down
in
his
bed
belly
tight
with
undigested
steak
he
was
feeling
wonderful
and
at
peace
with
the
world
linda
climbed
in
beside
him
wrestled
away
a
pillow
and
some
covers
and
snuggled
up
to
him
that
went
well
art
said
i
really
glad
you
two
hit
it
off
me
too
honey
linda
said
kissing
his
shoulder
through
his
tee
shirt
been
able
to
get
his
head
around
the
idea
of
sharing
a
bed
with
his
girlfriend
under
his
grandmother
roof
but
doing
so
nude
seemed
somehow
wrong
we
going
to
have
a
great
week
he
said
i
wish
it
would
never
end
yeah
she
said
and
began
to
snore
into
his
neck
the
next
morning
art
woke
stiff
and
serene
he
stretched
out
on
the
bed
dimly
noted
linda
absence
and
padded
to
the
bathroom
to
relieve
his
bladder
he
thought
about
crawling
back
into
bed
was
on
the
verge
of
doing
so
when
he
heard
the
familiar
nervewracking
harangue
of
linda
arguing
down
her
comm
he
opened
the
door
to
his
old
bedroom
and
there
she
was
stark
naked
and
beautiful
in
the
morning
sun
comm
in
hand
eyes
focused
in
the
middle
distance
shouting
no
goddamnit
no
not
here
jesus
are
you
a
moron
i
said
art
reached
out
to
touch
her
back
noticed
that
it
was
trembling
visibly
tense
and
rigid
and
pulled
his
hand
back
instead
he
quietly
set
about
fishing
in
his
small
bag
for
a
change
of
clothes
this
is
a
good
time
i
at
art
grandmother
place
all
right
talk
to
you
later
she
threw
her
comm
at
the
bed
and
whirled
around
everything
all
right
art
said
timidly
no
goddamnit
no
it
is
art
pulled
on
his
pants
and
kept
his
eyes
on
her
comm
which
was
dented
and
scratched
from
a
hundred
thousand
angry
hang
ups
he
hated
it
when
she
got
like
this
radiating

off
in
a

then
though

how
he
knew
he
knew
that
linda
and
fede
had
been
talking
he
that
linda
had
been
talking
to
fede
that
morning
and
not
her
fucking
ex

was
thinking
of
the
poor
schmuck
that
way
already
fucking
ex
christ
it
was
in
the
on
the
west
coast
it
could
be
the
ex

guess
fede
said
breezily
how
is
it
oh
terrific
great
to

the
old
hometown
and
all
how
things
with
perceptronics
when
should
i
plan

worry
about
it

and
we
sort
it
out

be
fantastic
and
do
worry
really
all
right
fine
fede
art
was
listening
any
more
fede
had
gone
into
bullshit
mode
and
all
art
was
thinking
of
was
why
linda
would
talk
to
fede
and
then
book
a
flight
to
la
how
things
in
london
he
said
automatically
fine
fine
fede
said
just
as
automatically
not
the
same
without
you
of
course
of
course
art
said
well
bye
then
bye
fede
said
art
felt
an
unsuspected
cunning
stirring
within
him
he
commed
linda
in
her
cab
hey
dude
he
said
hey
she
said
sounding
harassed
look
i
just
spoke
to
my
gran

she
really
upset
you
had
to
go
she
really
liked
you
well
i
liked
her
too
great

he
said
and
drew
in
a
breath
gran
made
you
a
sweater

made
me
one
too
she
a
knitter
she
wanted
me

if
you
give
me
your
ex
address

whatever
fede
and
linda
were
cooking

he

wise
to
it
and
then
he
nail
what
the
hell
was
it
though
my
cousins
visited
me
a
week
after
i
arrived
at
the
nuthouse
i
never
been
very
close
to
them
and
certainly
our
relationship
had
hardly
blossomed
during
the
week
i
spent
in
toronto
trying
to
track
down
linda
and
fede
plot
i
have
two
cousins
they
my
father
sister
kids
and
i
did
even
meet
them
until
i
was
about
twenty
and
tracking
down
my
family
history
ottawa
valley
kids
raised
on
pork
aging
hippie
muesli
and
corn
pone
it
a
weird
mix
and
we
never
had
a
conversation
that
i
would
consider
a
success
ever
met
a
violent
aggressive
hippie
with
an
intimate
knowledge
of
whose
genitals
one
must
masticate
in
order
to
get
a
building
permit
or
to
make
a
pot
bust
vanish
it
ai
pretty
cousin
the
first
is
audie
she
a
year
older
than
me
and
she
the
smart
one
on
that
side
of
the
family
the
one
who
ended
up
at
queen
university
for
a
bs
in
electrical
engineering
and
an
ma
in
poli
sci
and
even
so
finished
up
back
in
ottawa
freelancing
advice
to
clueless
mps
dealing
with
taiwanese
and
sierra
leonese
oem
importers
audie
married
to
a
nice
fella
whose
name
i
can
never
remember
and
they
gon
na
have
kids
in
five
years
it
on
a
timetable
that
she
actually
showed
me
once
when
i
went
out
there
on
biz
and
stopped
in
to
see
her
at
the
office
cousin
the
second
is
alphie
three
years
younger
than
me
raised
in
the
shadow
of
his
overachieving
sister
he
was
the
capo
of
ottawa
valley
script
kiddies
a
hacker
who
downloaded
other
people
code
for
defeating
copyright
systems
and
made
a
little
biz
for
himself
bootlegging
games
porn
music
and
video
until
the
wipo
bots
found
him
through
traffic
analysis
and
busted
his
ass
bankrupting
him
and
landing
him
in
the
clink
for
sixty
days
audie
and
alfie
are
blond
and
ruddy
and
a
little
heavyset
all
characteristics
they
got
from
their
father
side
so
add
that
to
the
fact
that
i
grew
up
without
being
aware
of
their
existence
and
you
understand
the
absence
of
any
real
for
them
i
do
dislike
them
but
i
have
so
little
in
common
with
them
that
it
like
hanging
out
with
time
travelers
from
the
historical
era
imaginable
but
they
came
to
boston
and
looked
me
up
in
the
nuthatch
they
found
me
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
the
ward
arms
and
ankles
crossed
dozing
in
a
shaft
of
sunlight
it
was
my
habitual
napping
spot
and
i
found
that
a
nap
between
group
and
dinner
was
a
good
way
to
sharpen
my
appetite
and
anasthetize
my
taste
buds
which
made
the
mealtime
slop
bearable
audie
shook
my
shoulder
gently
i
assumed
at
first
that
she
was
one
of
the
inmates
trying
to
get
me
involved
in
a
game
of
martian
so
i
brushed
her
hand
away
they
probably
got
him
all
doped
up
audie
said
the
voice
was
familiar
and
unplaceable
and
so
i
cracked
my
eyelid
squinting
up
at
her
silhouette
in
the
afternoon
sun
there
he
is
she
said
come
on
up
and
at
tiger
i
sat
up
abruptly
and
scrubbed
at
my
eyes
audie
i
asked
yup
and
alphie
alphie
pink
face
hove
into
view
hi
art
he
mumbled
jesus
i
said
getting
to
my
feet
audie
put
out
a
superfluous
steadying
hand
wow
surprised
audie
said
yeah
i
said
audie
thrust
a
bouquet
of
flowers
into
my
arms
what
are
you
doing
here
oh
your
grandmother
told
me
you
were
here
i
was
coming
down
to
boston
for
work
anyway
so
i
flew
in
a
day
early
so
i
could
drop
in
alphie
came
down
with
me
he
my
assistant
now
i
almost
said
something
about
convicted
felons
working
for
government
contractors
but
i
held
onto
my
tongue
consequently
an
awkward
silence
blossomed
well
audie
said
at
last
well
let
have
a
look
at
you
then
she
actually
took
a
lap
around
me
looking
me
up
and
down
making
little
noises
you
look
all
right
art
maybe
a
little
skinny
even
alphie
got
a
box
of
cookies
for
you
alphie
stepped
forward
and
produced
the
box
a
family
pack
of
president
choice
ridiculous
chocoholic
extra
chewies
a
canadian
store
brand
i
been
raised
on
within
seconds
of
seeing
them
my
mouth
was
sloshing
with
saliva
it
good
to
see
you
audie
alphie
i
managed
to
say
it
without
spitting
an
impressive
feat
given
the
amount
of
saliva
i
was
contending
with
thanks
for
the
care
package
we
stared
at
each
other
blankly
so
art
alphie
said
so
how
do
you
like
it
here
well
alphie
i
said
i
ca
say
as
i
do
really
as
far
as
i
can
tell
sane
as
i
ever
been
it
just
a
bunch
of
unfortunate
coincidences
and
bad
judgment
that
got
me
here
i
refrain
from
mentioning
alphie
propensity
for
lapses
in
judgment
wow
alphie
said
that
a
bummer
we
should
do
something
you
know
audie
not
really
my
area
of
expertise
audie
said
in
clipped
tones
i
would
if
i
could
you
know
that
right
art
we
family
after
all
oh
sure
i
say
magnanimously
but
now
that
i
looking
at
them
my
cousins
who
got
into
a
thousand
times
more
trouble
than
i
ever
did
driving
drunk
pirating
software
growing
naughty
smokables
in
the
backyard
and
got
away
from
it
unscathed
i
feel
a
stirring
of
desperate
hope
only
only
what
alphie
said
only
maybe
audie
do
you
think
you
could
that
is
if
you
got
the
time
do
you
think
you
could
have
a
little
look
around
and
see
if
any
of
your
contacts
could
maybe
set
me
up
with
a
decent
lawyer
who
might
be
able
to
get
my
case
reheard
or
a
shrink
for
that
matter
something
frankly
it
really
seem
like
they
going
to
let
me
go
ever
ever
audie
squirmed
and
glared
at
her
brother
i
do
really
know
anyone
that
fits
the
bill
she
said
at
last
well
not
sure
why
would
you
you
would
i
thought
that
i
was
starting
to
babble
but
i
could
help
myself
you
would
but
maybe
someone
that
someone
you
know
knows
who
can
do
something
about
it
i
mean
it
ca
hurt
to
ask
around
can
it
i
suppose
it
ca
she
said
wow
i
said
that
would
just
be
fantastic
you
know
thanks
in
advance
audie
really
i
mean
it
just
for
trying
i
ca
thank
you
enough
this
place
well
it
really
sucks
there
it
was
hanging
out
my
desperate
and
pathetic
plea
for
help
really
there
was
nowhere
to
go
but
down
from
there
still
the
silence
stretched
and
snapped
and
i
said
hey
speaking
of
can
i
offer
you
guys
a
tour
of
the
ward
i
mean
it
not
much
but
it
home
so
i
showed
them
the
droolers
and
the
fondlers
and
the
pukers
and
my
horrible
little
room
and
the
scarred
table
and
the
sticky
decks
of
cards
and
the
tv
alphie
actually
seemed
to
dig
it
in
a
kind
of
horrified
way
he
started
comparing
it
to
the
new
kingston
pen
where
he
done
his
bit
after
seeing
the
first
puker
audie
went
quiet
and
leaving
nothing
but
alphie
enthusiastic
gurgling
as
counterpoint
to
my
tour
art
audie
said
finally
desperately
do
you
think
they
let
us
take
you
out
for
a
cup
of
coffee
or
a
walk
around
the
grounds
i
asked
the
nurse
looked
at
a
comm
for
a
while
then
shook
her
head
nope
i
reported
they
need
a
day
notice
of
supervised
excursions
well
too
bad
audie
said
i
understood
her
strategy
immediately
too
bad
nothing
for
it
then
guess
we
should
get
back
to
our
hotel
i
planted
a
dry
kiss
on
her
cheek
shook
alphie
sweaty
hand
and
they
were
gone
i
skipped
supper
that
night
and
ate
cookies
until
i
could
eat
another
bite
of
rich
chocolate
got
a
comm
i
ask
doc
szandor
casually
what
for
wan
na
get
some
of
this
down
the
ideas
for
the
hospital
before
i
go
back
out
on
the
ward
and
it
what
i
want
to
do
mostly
but
the
temptation
to
just
log
on
and
do
my
thing
oh
sure
he
says
checking
his
watch
i
can
probably
stall
them
for
a
couple
hours
more
feel
free
to
make
a
call
or
whatever
too
doc
szandor
a
good
egg
father
ferlenghetti
showed
up
at
art
gran
at
just
as
the
sun
began
to
set
over
the
lake
and
art
and
he
shared
lemonade
on
gran
sunporch
and
watched
as
the
waves
on
lake
ontario
turned
harshly
golden
so
arthur
tell
me
what
are
you
doing
with
your
life
the
father
said
he
had
grown
exquisitely
aged
almost
translucent
since
art
had
seen
him
last
in
his
dog
collar
and
aviator
shades
he
looked
like
a
waxworks
figure
art
had
forgotten
all
about
the
father
visit
until
gran
stepped
out
of
her
superheated
kitchen
to
remind
him
he
hastily
showered
and
changed
into
fresh
slacks
and
a
mostly
clean
tee
shirt
and
had
agreed
to
entertain
the
priest
while
his
gran
finished
cooking
supper
now
he
wished
he
signed
up
to
do
the
cooking
i
working
in
london
he
said
the
same
work
as
ever
but
for
an
english
firm
that
what
your
grandmother
tells
me
but
is
it
making
you
happy
is
it
what
you
plan
to
do
with
the
rest
of
your
life
i
guess
so
art
said
sure
you
do
sound
so
sure
father
ferlenghetti
said
well
the
part
excellent
the
politics
are
pretty
ugly
though
to
tell
the
truth
ah
well
we
ca
avoid
politics
can
we
no
i
guess
we
ca
art
i
always
known
that
you
were
a
very
smart
young
man
but
being
smart
is
the
same
as
being
happy
if
you
very
lucky
you
get
to
be
my
age
and
you
look
back
on
your
life
and
be
glad
you
lived
it
gran
called
him
in
for
dinner
before
he
could
think
of
a
reply
he
settled
down
at
the
table
and
gran
handed
him
a
pen
what
this
for
he
asked
sign
the
tablecloth
she
said
write
a
little
something
and
sign
it
and
date
it
nice
and
clear
please
sign
the
tablecloth
yes
i
just
started
a
fresh
one
i
have
everyone
sign
my
tablecloth
and
then
i
embroider
the
signatures
in
so
i
have
a
record
of
everyone
who
been
here
for
supper
they
make
a
nice
heirloom
for
your
children
i
show
you
the
old
ones
after
we
eat
what
should
i
write
it
up
to
you
while
gran
and
the
father
looked
on
art
uncapped
the
pen
and
thought
and
thought
his
mind
blank
finally
he
wrote
for
my
gran
no
matter
where
i
am
i
know
you
thinking
of
me
he
signed
it
with
a
flourish
lovely
let
eat
now
art
meant
to
log
in
and
see
if
colonelonic
had
dredged
up
any
intel
on
ex
but
he
found
himself
trapped
on
the
sunporch
with
gran
and
the
father
and
a
small
stack
of
linen
tablecloths
hairy
with
embroidered
wishes
he
traced
their
braille
with
his
fingertips
recognizing
the
names
of
his
childhood
gran
and
the
father
talked
late
into
the
night
and
the
next
thing
art
knew
gran
was
shaking
him
awake
he
was
draped
in
a
tablecloth
that
he
pulled
over
himself
like
a
blanket
and
she
folded
it
and
put
it
away
while
he
ungummed
his
eyes
and
staggered
off
to
bed
audie
called
him
early
the
next
morning
waking
him
up
hey
art
it
your
cousin
audie
you
do
have
any
other
female
cousins
so
yes
that
a
good
guess
your
gran
told
me
you
were
in
canada
for
a
change
yup
i
am
just
for
a
little
holiday
well
it
been
long
enough
what
do
you
do
in
london
again
i
a
consultant
for
telekom
he
has
this
part
of
the
conversation
every
time
he
speaks
with
audie
somehow
the
particulars
of
his
job
just
could
seem
to
stick
in
her
mind
what
kind
of
consultant
user
experience
i
help
design
their
interactive
stuff
how
ottawa
they
pay
you
for
that
huh
well
nice
work
if
you
can
get
it
art
believed
that
audie
was
being
sincere
in
her
amazement
at
his
niche
in
the
working
world
and
not
sneering
at
all
still
he
had
to
keep
himself
from
saying
something
snide
about
the
lack
of
tangible
good
resulting
from
keeping
mps
up
to
date
on
the
poleconomy
of
semiconductor
production
in
pacrim
sweatshops
they
sure
do
how
ottawa
amazing
and
why
london
ca
you
find
work
at
home
yeah
i
suppose
i
could
this
just
seemed
like
a
good
job
at
the
time
ottawa
seemed
huh
you
going
to
be
moving
back
then
quitting
not
anytime
soon
how
ottawa
ottawa
it
beautiful
this
time
of
year

for
fede
and
his
damned
patent
application
sign
over
the
exclusive
rights
to
the
patent
for
one
dollar
and
services
rendered
getting
me
a
decent
lawyer
and
springing
me
from
this
damned
hole
my
last
lawyer
was
a
dickhead
he
met
me
at
the
courtroom
fifteen
minutes
before
the
hearing
in
a
private
room
whose
fixtures
had
the
sticky
filthiness
of
a
toilet
art
yes
hello
i
allan
mendelson
your
attorney
how
are
you
he
was
well
over
but
weighed
no
more
than
lbs
and
hunched
over
his
skinny
ribs
while
he
talked
his
hands
his
suit
looked
like
the
kind
of
thing
you
see
on
a
piccadilly
station
homeless
person
clean
enough
and
fitting
but
with
an
indefinable
air
of
cheapness
and
falsehood
well
not
so
good
i
said
they
upped
my
meds
this
morning
so
i
pretty
logy
ca
concentrate
they
said
it
was
to
keep
me
calm
while
i
was
transported
dirty
trick
huh
what
he
been
browsing
through
his
comm
tapping
through
what
i
assumed
was
my
file
no
no
it
perfectly
standard
this
is
a
trial
it
a
hearing
we
all
on
the
same
side
here
he
tapped
some
more
your
side
good
art
said
my
grandmother
came
down
and
she
wants
to
testify
on
my
behalf
oooh
the
fixer
said
shaking
his
head
no
not
a
great
idea
she
not
a
mental
health
professional
is
she
no
i
said
but
she
known
me
all
my
life
she
knows
i
not
a
danger
to
myself
or
others
sorry
that
not
appropriate
we
all
love
our
families
but
the
court
wants
to
hear
from
people
who
have
qualified
opinions
on
this
subject
your
doctors
will
speak
of
course
do
i
get
to
speak
if
you
want
to
that
not
a
very
good
idea
either
though
afraid
if
the
judge
wants
to
hear
from
you
she
address
you
otherwise
your
best
bet
is
to
sit
still
no
fidgeting
look
as
sane
and
calm
as
you
can
i
felt
like
i
had
bricks
dangling
from
my
limbs
and
one
stuck
in
my
brain
the
new
meds
painted
the
world
with
translucent
whitewash
stuffed
cotton
in
my
ears
and
made
my
tongue
thick
slowly
my
brain
absorbed
all
of
this
you
mean
that
my
gran
ca
talk
i
ca
talk
and
all
the
court
hears
is
the
doctors
do
be
difficult
art
this
is
a
hearing
to
determine
your
competency
a
group
of
talented
mental
health
professionals
have
observed
you
for
the
past
week
and
they
come
to
some
conclusions
based
on
those
observations
if
everyone
who
came
before
the
court
for
a
competency
hearing
brought
out
a
bunch
of
irrelevant
witnesses
and
made
long
speeches
the
court
calendar
would
be
backlogged
for
decades
then
other
people
who
were
in
for
observation
be
able
to
get
their
hearings
it
would
work
for
anyone
you
see
that
right
not
really
i
really
think
it
would
be
better
if
i
got
to
testify
on
my
behalf
i
have
that
right
do
i
he
sighed
and
looked
very
if
you
insist
i
call
you
to
speak
but
as
your
lawyer
it
my
professional
opinion
that
you
should
do
this
i
really
would
prefer
to
he
snapped
his
comm
shut
i
meet
you
in
the
courtroom
then
the
bailiff
will
take
you
in
can
you
tell
my
gran
where
i
am
she
waiting
in
the
court
i
think
sorry
i
have
other
cases
to
cope
with
i
ca
really
play
messenger
afraid
when
he
left
the
little
office
i
felt
as
though
i
been
switched
off
the
drugs
weighted
my
eyelids
and
soothed
my
panic
and
outrage
later
i
be
livid
but
right
then
i
could
barely
keep
from
folding
my
arms
on
the
grimy
table
and
resting
my
head
on
them
the
hearing
went
so
fast
i
barely
even
noticed
it
i
sat
with
my
lawyer
and
the
doctors
stood
up
and
entered
their
reports
into
evidence
i
do
think
they
read
them
aloud
even
just
squirted
them
at
the
court
reporter
my
gran
sat
behind
me
on
a
chair
that
was
separated
from
the
court
proper
by
a
banister
she
had
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
the
whole
time
and
it
felt
like
an
anvil
there
to
my
dopey
muscles
all
right
art
my
jackass
lawyer
said
giving
me
a
prod
here
your
turn
stand
up
and
keep
it
brief
i
struggled
to
my
feet
the
judge
was
an
asian
woman
about
my
age
a
small
round
head
set
atop
a
shapeless
robe
and
perched
on
a
high
seat
behind
a
high
bench
your
honor
i
said
i
did
know
what
to
say
next
all
my
wonderful
rhetoric
had
fled
me
the
judge
looked
at
me
briefly
then
went
back
to
tapping
her
comm
maybe
she
was
playing
solitaire
or
looking
at
porn
i
asked
to
have
a
moment
to
address
the
court
my
lawyer
suggested
that
i
not
do
this
but
i
insisted
here
the
thing
there
no
way
for
me
to
win
here
there
a
long
story
about
how
i
got
here
basically
i
had
a
disagreement
with
some
of
my
coworkers
who
were
doing
something
that
i
thought
was
immoral
they
decided
that
it
would
be
best
for
their
plans
if
i
was
out
of
the
way
for
a
little
while
so
that
i
could
screw
them
up
so
they
coopered
this
up
told
the
london
police
that
i
gone
nuts
so
i
ended
up
in
an
institution
here
for
observation
on
the
grounds
that
i
was
dangerously
paranoid
when
the
people
at
the
institution
asked
me
about
it
i
told
them
what
had
happened
because
i
was
claiming
that
the
people
who
had
me
locked
up
were
conspiring
to
make
me
look
paranoid
the
doctors
decided
that
i
paranoid
but
tell
me
how
could
i
demonstrate
my
i
mean
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
second
i
was
put
away
for
observation
i
was
guaranteed
to
be
found
wanting
nothing
i
could
have
said
or
done
would
have
made
a
difference
the
judge
looked
up
from
her
comm
and
gave
me
another
i
was
wearing
my
best
day
clothes
which
were
my
basic
london
shabby
chic
white
shirt
and
gray
wool
slacks
and
narrow
blue
tie
it
looked
natty
enough
in
the
uk
but
i
knew
that
in
the
us
it
made
me
look
like
an
overaged
mormon
the
judge
kept
looking
at
me
to
action
i
thought
your
speeches
with
a
call
to
it
was
another
bit
of
goofy
west
coast
vulcan
mind
control
courtesy
of
linda
fucking
ex
so
here
what
i
wanted
to
do
i
wanted
to
stand
up
here
and
let
you
know
what
had
happened
to
me
and
ask
you
for
advice
if
we
assume
for
the
moment
that
crazy
how
should
i
demonstrate
that
here
in
the
court
the
judge
rolled
her
head
from
shoulder
to
shoulder
making
glossy
black
waterfalls
of
her
hair
the
whole
hearing
is
very
fuzzy
for
me
but
that
hair
who
ever
heard
of
a
civil
servant
with
good
hair
berry
she
said
i
afraid
i
do
have
much
to
tell
you
it
my
responsibility
to
listen
to
qualified
testimony
and
make
a
ruling
you
presented
any
qualified
testimony
to
support
your
position
in
the
absence
of
such
testimony
my
only
option
is
to
remand
you
into
the
custody
of
the
department
of
mental
health
until
such
time
as
a
group
of
qualified
professionals
see
fit
to
release
you
i
expected
her
to
bang
a
gavel
but
instead
she
just
scritched
at
her
comm
and
squirted
the
order
at
the
court
reporter
and
i
was
led
away
i
did
even
have
a
chance
to
talk
to
gran

though
i
got
ta
go
to
london
art
vision
throbbed
with
his
pulse
as
he
jammed
his
clothes
back
into
his
backpack
with
one
hand
while
he
booked
a
ticket
to
london
on
his
comm
with
the
other
sweat
beaded
on
his
forehead
as
he
ordered
the
taxi
while
scribbling
a
note
to
gran
on
the
of
her
fridge
he
was
verging
on
berserk
by
the
time
he
hit
airport
security
the
guard
played
the
ultrasound
flashlight
over
him
and
looked
him
up
and
down
with
his
goggles
then
had
him
walk
through
the
chromatograph
twice
art
tried
to
breathe
calmly
but
it
was
happening
he
take
two
deep
breaths
think
about
how
he
was
yup
calming
down
pretty
good
especially
since
he
was
going
to
london
to
confront
fede
about
the
fact
that
his
friend
had
screwed
him
stabbed
him
in
the
back
using
his
girlfriend
to
distract
him
and
meanwhile
she
was
in
los
angeles
sleeping
with
her
fucking
ex
who
was
going
to
steal
his
idea
and
sell
it
as
his
own
that
fucking
prick
boning
his
girl
right
then
almost
certainly
laughing
about
poor
old
art
dumbfuck
stuck
in
toronto
with
his
thumb
up
his
ass
oh
fede
was
going
to
pay
that
right
he
was
and
then
he
be
huffing
down
his
nose
hyperventilating
really
losing
his
shit
right
there
the
security
guard
finally
asked
him
if
he
needed
a
doctor
no
art
said
that
fine
i
just
upset
a
friend
of
mine
died
suddenly
and
i
flying
to
london
for
the
funeral
the
guard
seemed
satisfied
with
this
explanation
and
let
him
pass
finally
he
fought
the
urge
to
get
plastered
on
the
flight
and
vibrated
in
his
seat
instead
jiggling
his
leg
until
his
seatmate
an
elderly
businessman
spent
the
flight
thus
far
wrinkling
his
brow
at
a
series
of
spreadsheets
on
his
comm
actually
put
a
hand
on
art
knee
and
said
switch
off
the
motor
son
you
gon
na
burn
it
out
if
you
idle
it
that
high
all
the
way
to
gatwick
art
nearly
leapt
out
of
his
seat
when
the
flight
attendant
wheeled
up
the
cart
bristling
with
novelty
beakers
of
fantastically
old
whiskey
shaped
like
jigging
scotchmen
and
drunken
leprechauns
swinging
from
lampposts
by
the
time
he
hit
uk
customs
he
was
supersonic
ready
to
hammer
an
entire
packet
of
player
filterless
into
his
face
and
light
them
with
a
blowtorch
it
was
even
gmt
and
the
sikh
working
the
booth
looked
asleep
under
his
turban
but
he
woke
right
up
when
art
stepped
past
the
red
line
and
slapped
both
palms
on
the
counter
and
used
them
as
a
lever
to
support
him
as
he
pogoed
in
place
your
business
in
england
sir
i
work
for
telekom
let
me
beam
you
my
visa
his
hands
were
shaking
so
badly
he
dropped
his
comm
to
the
hard
floor
with
an
ominous
clatter
he
snatched
it
up
and
rubbed
at
the
fresh
dent
in
the
cover
then
flipped
it
open
and
stabbed
at
it
with
a
filthy
fingernail
thank
you
sir
door
number
two
please
art
took
one
step
towards
the
baggage
carousel
when
the
words
registered
customs
search
godfuckingdammit
he
jittered
in
the
private
interview
room
until
another
customs
officer
showed
up
overrode
his
comm
and
read
in
his
id
and
credentials
then
stared
at
them
for
a
long
moment
are
you
quite
all
right
sir
just
a
little
wound
up
art
said
trying
desperately
to
sound
normal
he
thought
about
telling
the
dead
friend
story
again
but
unlike
a
lowly
airport
security
drone
the
customs
man
had
the
ability
and
inclination
to
actually
verify
it
too
much
coffee
on
the
plane
need
to
have
a
slash
like
you
believe
the
customs
man
grimaced
slightly
then
chewed
a
corner
of
his
little
moustache
everything
else
is
all
right
though
everything
fine
back
from
a
business
trip
to
the
states
and
canada
all
jetlagged
you
know
can
you
believe
the
bastards
actually
expect
me
at
the
office
today
this
might
work
piss
and
moan
about
the
office
until
he
gets
bored
and
lets
him
go
i
mean
you
work
your
guts
out
fly
halfway
around
the
world
and
do
it
some
more
get
strapped
into
a
torture
seat
you
think
virgin
springs
for
tickets
for
its
employees
hell
no
for
six
hours
then
they
want
you
at
the
goddamned
office
virgin
the
customs
man
said
eyebrows
going
up
but
you
flew
in
on
ba
sir
shit
of
course
he
had
booked
a
virgin
flight
that
what
fede
be
expecting
him
to
do
he
be
watching
for
art
to
use
his
employee
discount
and
hop
a
flight
back
yes
can
you
believe
it
art
thought
furiously
they
called
me
back
suddenly
would
even
let
me
wait
around
for
one
of
their
own
damned
planes
one
minute
i
eating
breakfast
the
next
i
in
a
taxi
heading
for
the
airport
i
forgot
half
of
my
damned
underwear
in
the
hotel
room
think
they
could
cope
with
little
without
crawling
up
my
cock
would
you
sir
please
calm
down
the
customs
man
looked
alarmed
and
art
realized
that
he
begun
to
pace
sorry
sorry
it
just
sucks
bad
job
time
to
quit
i
think
i
should
think
so
the
customs
man
said
welcome
to
england
traffic
was
light
and
the
cabbie
drove
like
a
madman
art
kept
flinching
away
from
the
oncoming
traffic
already
unaccustomed
to
driving
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
england
seemed
filthy
and
gray
and
shabby
to
him
now
tiny
little
cars
with
tiny
drivers
filled
with
vegetarian
and
bad
dentistry
in
his
rooms
in
camden
town
art
took
a
hasty
and
vengeful
census
of
his
stupid
belongings
sagging
rental
furniture
and
bad
art
prints
hanging
askew
not
any
more
not
after
he
smashed
them
to
the
floor
bad
english
clothes
toss
onto
the
floor
looking
for
one
thing
he
be
caught
dead
wearing
in
nyc
and
guess
what
not
a
single
thing
stupid
keepsakes
from
the
camden
market
funny
novelty
lighters
retro
rave
flyers
preserved
in
glassine
envelopes
he
was
about
to
overturn
his
ugly
little
pressboard
coffee
table
when
he
realized
that
there
was
something
on
it
a
small
box
with
a
simple
brass
catch
inside
the
two
hundred
thousand
years
old
heavy
with
the
weight
of
the
ages
he
hefted
it
in
his
hand
it
felt
ancient
and
lethal
he
dropped
it
into
his
jacket
pocket
instantly
deforming
the
jacket
into
a
slant
he
kicked
the
coffee
table
over
time
to
go
see
fede
i
have
wished
for
a
comm
a
hundred
thousand
times
an
hour
since
they
stuck
me
in
this
shithole
and
now
that
i
have
one
i
do
know
who
to
call
not
smart
not
happy
i
run
my
fingers
over
the
keypad
think
about
all
the
stupid
terrible
decisions
that
i
made
on
the
way
to
this
place
in
my
life
i
feel
like
i
could
burst
into
tears
like
i
could
tear
the
hair
out
of
my
head
like
i
could
pound
my
fists
bloody
on
the
floor
my
fingers
splayed
over
the
keypad
tap
out
the
old
nervous
rhythms
of
the
phone
numbers
i
know
all
my
life
my
first
house
my
mom
comm
gran
place
gran

tap
out

the
stitches

my
jaw

in
counterpoint
with
my
back
i
tried
to
explain
it
all
to
father
ferlenghetti
but
i
did
have
the
details
right
he
said
it
did
make
any
sense
it
does
they
do
care
they
just
put
me
here
he
said
that
they
should
have
let
you
put
your
own
experts
up
when
you
had
your
hearing
well
of
they
should
have

said
that

to
that

used
to
live
there

i
did
know
oh

a
congregation

sure
of
it

there
after

a
harvard
man

father

number
gran
tonaishah
facepaint
distorted
into
wild
grimaces
when
art
banged
into
house
with
sleepdep
airline
crud
crusted
at
the
corners
of
his
lips
whole
person
quivering
with
righteous
smitefulness
he
commed
the
door
savagely
and
yanked
it
so
hard
that
the
snapped
with
a
popping
sound
like
a
metal
ruler
being
whacked
on
a
desk
the
door
caromed
back
into
his
heel
and
nearly
sent
him
sprawling
but
he
converted
its
momentum
into
a
jog
through
the
halls
to
his
miniature
office
the
last
three
times
spoken
to
fede
the
bastard
had
been
working
out
of
his
office
stealing
his
papers
no
doubt
though
that
had
occurred
to
art
until
his
plane
was
somewhere
over
ireland
fede
was
halfway
out
of
art
chair
when
art
bounded
into
the
office
face
was
gratifyingly
pale
his
eyes
thoroughly
wide
and
scared
art
bother
to
slow
down
just
slammed
into
fede
bashing
foreheads
with
him
art
smelled
a
puff
of
his
own
travel
sweat
and
fede
spicy
lilac
vegetal
saw
blood
welling
from
fede
eyebrow
hi
pal
he
said
kicking
the
door
shut
with
a
crash
that
resounded
through
the
walls
art
jesus
fucking
christ
what
the
hell
is
wrong
with
you
fede
backed
away
to
the
far
corner
of
the
office
sending
art
chair
over
backwards
wheels
spinning
ergonomic
adjustment
knobs
and
rods
sticking
up
in
the
air
like
the
legs
of
an
overturned
beetle
tunepay
art
said
booting
the
chair
into
fede
shins
is
that
the
best
fucking
name

could
come
up
with
or
did
toby
and
linda

up

held
his
hands
out
palms
first
what

about

you
art
shook
his
head
slowly
come
on
fede
it
time
to
stop
blowing
smoke
up
my
cock
i
honestly
have
no
idea
art
bellowed
closing
up
with
fede
getting
close
enough
to
see
the
flecks
of
spittle
flying
off
his
lips
spatter
fede
face
i
had
enough
bullshit
fede
abruptly
fede
lurched
forward
sweeping
art
feet
out
from
underneath
him
and
landing
on
art
chest
seconds
after
art
slammed
to
the
scratched
and
splintered
hardwood
floor
he
pinned
art
arms
under
his
knees
then
leaned
forward
and
crushed
art
windpipe
with
his
forearm
bearing
down
you
dumb
sack
of
shit
he
hissed
we
were
going
to
cut
you
in

knew
you
would
go
for
it
but
we
were

hearing
you
dumb
canuck
art
vision
had
contracted
to
a
fuzzy
black
vignette
with
fede
florid
face
in
the
center
of
it
he
gasped
convulsively
fighting
for
air
he
felt
his
bladder
go
and
hot
urine
stream
down
his
groin
and
over
his
thighs
an
instant
later
fede
sprang
back
from
him
face
twisted
in
disgust
hands
brushing
at
his
pants
damn
it
he
said
as
art
rolled
onto
his
side
and
retched
art
got
up
on
all
fours
then
lurched
erect
as
he
did
the
axe
head
in
his
pocket
swung
wildly
and
knocked
against
the
glass
pane
beside
his
office
door
spiderwebbing
it
with
cracks
moving
with
dreamlike
slowness
art
reached
into
his
pocket
clasped
the
axe
head
turned
it
in
his
hand
so
that
the
edge
was
pointing
outwards
he
lifted
it
out
of
his
pocket
and
held
his
hand
behind
his
back
he
staggered
to
fede
who
was
glaring
at
him
daring
him
to
do
something
his
chest
heaving
art
windmilled
his
arm
over
his
head
and
brought
the
axe
head
down
solidly
on
fede
head
it
hit
with
an
impact
that
jarred
his
arm
to
the
shoulder
and
he
dropped
the
axe
head
to
the
floor
where
it
fell
with
a
thud
crusted
with
blood
and
hair
for
the
first
time
in
years
fede
crumpled
back
into
the
office
wall
slid
down
it
into
a
sitting
position
his
eyes
were
open
and
staring
blood
streamed
over
his
face
art
looked
at
fede
in
horrified
fascination
he
noticed
that
fede
was
breathing
shallowly
almost
panting
and
realized
dimly
that
this
meant
he
was
a
murderer
he
turned
and
fled
the
office
nearly
bowling
tonaishah
over
in
the
corridor
call
an
ambulance
he
said
then
shoved
her
aside
and
fled
house
and
disappeared
into
the
piccadilly
lunchtime
crowd
i
am
sprung
father
ferlenghetti
has
been
licensed
to
practice
psychiatry
in
massachusetts
for
forty
years
but
the
court
gave
him
standing
the
judge
actually
winked
at
me
when
he
took
the
stand
and
stopped
scritching
on
her
comm
as
the
priest
said
a
lot
of
fantastically
embarrassing
things
about
my
general
fitness
for
human
consumption
the
sanitarium
sent
a
single
junior
doc
to
my
hearing
a
kid
so
young
mistaken
him
for
a
hospital
driver
when
he
climbed
into
the
van
with
me
and
gunned
the
engine
but
no
he
was
a
doctor
who
apparently
been
briefed
on
my
case
though
not
very
well
when
the
judge
asked
him
if
he
had
any
opinions
on
father
ferlenghetti
testimony
he
fumbled
with
his
comm
while
the
father
stared
at
him
through
eyebrows
thick
enough
to
hide
a
hamster
in
then
finally
stammered
a
few
verbatim
notes
from
my
intake
interview
blushed
and
sat
down
thank
you
the
judge
said
shaking
her
head
as
she
said
it
gran
seated
beside
me
put
one
hand
on
my
knee
and
one
hand
on
the
knee
of
doc
a
hotshot
harvard
law
whom
we
retained
as
corporate
counsel
for
a
new
limited
liability
corporation
we
signed
the
articles
of
incorporation
the
day
before
after
group
it
was
the
last
thing
doc
szandor
did
before
resigning
his
post
at
the
sanitarium
to
take
up
the
position
of
chief
medical
officer
at
humancare
llc
a
corporation
with
no
assets
no
employees
and
a
sheaf
of
shitkicking
ideas
for
redesigning
mental
hospitals
using
tech
and
a
little
bit
of
ue
mojo
art
was
most
of
the
way
to
the
tube
when
he
ran
into
lester
literally
lester
must
have
seen
him
coming
because
he
stepped
right
into
art
path
from
out
of
the
crowd
art
ploughed
into
him
bounced
off
of
his
dented
armor
and
would
have
fallen
over
had
lester
not
caught
his
arm
and
steadied
him
art
is
it
how
you
doin
mate
art
gaped
at
him
he
was
thinner
than
he
been
when
he
tried
to
shake
art
and
linda
down
in
the
doorway
of
the
boots
grimier
and
more
desperate
his
tone
was
just
as
bemused
as
ever
though
jesus
christ
lester
not
now
i
in
a
hurry
you
have
to
rob
me
later
all
right
lester
chuckled
wryly
still
a
clever
bastard
you
look
like
you
having
some
hard
times
my
old
son
maybe
that
you
not
even
worth
robbing
eh
right
i
skint
sorry

running
into
you
now
i
must
be
going
he
tried
to
pull
away
but
lester
fingers
dug
into
his
biceps
emphatically
painfully
hear
you
ran
into
tom
led
him
a
merry
chase
you
know
i
spent
a
whole
week
in
the
nick
on
account
of
you
art
jerked
his
arm
again
without
effect
you
tried
to
rob
me
les
you
knew
the
job
was
dangerous
when
you
took
it
all
right
now
let
me
go
i
got
a
train
to
catch
holidays
how
sweet
thought
you
were
broke
though
a
motorized
scooter
pulled
up
in
the
kerb
lane
beside
them
it
was
piloted
by
a
smart
young
policewoman
with
a
silly
foam
helmet
and
outsized
pads
on
her
knees
and
elbows
she
looked
like
the
kid
with
the
mom
who
inflicts
criminally
dorky
fashions
on
her
daughter
making
her
the
neighborhood
laughingstock
everything
all
right
gentlemen
lester
eyes
closed
and
he
sighed
a
sigh
that
was
halfway
to
a
groan
oh
yes
officer
art
said
peter
and
i
were
just
making
some
plans
to
see
our
auntie
for
supper
tonight
lester
opened
his
eyes
then
the
corners
of
his
mouth
incremented
upwards
yeah
he
said
cousin
alphonse
is
here
all
the
way
from
canada
and
auntie
mad
to
cook
him
a
proper
english
meal
the
policewoman
sized
them
up
then
shook
her
head
sir
begging
your
pardon
but
i
must
tell
you
that
we
have
clubs
in
london
where
a
gentleman
such
as
yourself
can
find
a
young
companion
legally
we
thoroughly
discourage
making
such
arrangements
on
the
high
street
just
a
word
to
the
wise
all
right
art
blushed
to
his
eartips
thank
you
officer
he
said
with
a
weak
smile
i
keep
that
in
mind
the
constable
gave
lester
a
hard
look
then
revved
her
scooter
and
pulled
into
traffic
her
arm
slicing
the
air
in
a
sharp
turn
signal
well
lester
said
once
she
was
on
the
roundabout

reason
to
avoid

sunk
six
months
of
living

and

with
new
cards
while

eight
new
gizmos
that
constitute

card
the
credit
our
local
baby
amex
rep
dropped
it
off
himself
after
doc
szandor
faxed
over
the
signed
contract
from
the
bureau
of
health
half
a
million
bucks
for
a
install
at
the
very
same
route
nuthatch
where
i
been
treated
if
that
works
we
be
rolling
out
a
dozen
more
installs
over
the
next
year
smart
doors
public
stats
locator
bracelets
that
let
clients
i
been
learning
the
nuthouse
jargon
and
have
forcibly
removed
patient
from
my
vocabulary
discover
other
clients
with
similar
treatment
regimens
on
the
ward
bells
and
whistles
galore
i
am
cruising
the
masspike
with
humancare
employee
who
is
in
turn
holding
onto
humancare
paycheck
caitlin
husband
has
been
very
patient
over
the
past
six
months
as
she
worked
days
fixing
the
ailing
machinery
at
the
sanitarium
and
nights
prototyping
my
designs
he
been
likewise
patient
with
my
presence
on
his
sagging
sofa
where
had
my
nightly
repose
faithfully
since
my
release
caitlin
and
i
have
actually
seen
precious
little
of
each
other
considering
that
i
been
living
under
her
roof
doc
szandor
cambridge
apartment
is
hardly
bigger
than
my
room
at
the
hospital
and
between
his
snoring
and
the
hard
floor
i
did
even
last
a
whole
night
there
we
communicated
mostly
by
notes
commed
to
her
fridge
and
prototypes
left
atop
my
suitcase
of
and
toiletries
at
the
foot
of
my
makeshift
bed
when
she
staggered
in
from
her
workbench
while
i
snored
away
the
nights
come
to
think
of
it
i
have
really
seen
much
of
doc
szandor
either
he
been
holed
up
in
his
rooms
chatting
away
on
the
est
channels
i
am
well
rested
i
am
happy
my
back
is
loose
and
my
chi
is
flowing
i
am
driving
my
few
belongings
to
a
lovely
one
to
sleep
in
one
to
work
in
flat
overlooking
harvard
square
where
the
pretty
and
their
shaggy
boyfriends
tease
one
another
in
the
technical
argot
of
a
dozen
abstruse
disciplines
i
looking
forward
to
picking
up
a
basic
physics
law
medicine
and
business
vocabulary
just
by
sitting
in
my
window
with
my
comm
tapping
away
at
new
designs
we
drive
up
to
a
toll
plaza
and
i
crank
the
yielding
steering
wheel
toward
the
ezpass
lane
the
dealer
installed
the
transponder
and
gave
me
a
brochure
explaining
the
sony
family
approach
to
maximum
driving
convenience
but
as
i
approach
the
toll
gate
it
stays
steadfastly
down
the
veddic
hud
flashes
an
instruction
to
pull
over
to
the
booth
a
bored
attendant
leans
out
of
the
toll
booth
and
squirts
his
comm
at
me
and
the
hud
comes
to
life
with
an
animated
commercial
for
the
new
improved
tunepay
service
now
under
direct
masspike
management
the
tunepay
scandal
been
hot
news
for
weeks
now
bribery
corruption
patent
disputes
i
been
gratified
to
discover
that
my
name
had
been
removed
from
the
patent
applications
sparing
me
the
nightly
hounding
fede
and
linda
and
her
fucking
ex
had
been
subjected
to
on
my
comm
as
the
legal
net
tightened
around
them
i
end
up
laughing
so
hard
that
caitlin
gets
out
of
the
car
and
walks
around
to
my
side
opens
the
door
and
pulls
me
bodily
to
the
passenger
side
she
serenely
ignores
the
blaring
of
the
horns
from
the
aggravated
psychotic
boston
drivers
stacked
up
behind
us
walks
back
to
the
driver
side
and
takes
the
wheel
thanks
i
tell
her
and
lay
a
hand
on
her
pudgy
freckled
arm
you
belong
in
a
loony
bin
you
know
that
she
says
punching
me
in
the
thigh
harder
than
is
strictly
necessary

say

up
some
music
on
the
