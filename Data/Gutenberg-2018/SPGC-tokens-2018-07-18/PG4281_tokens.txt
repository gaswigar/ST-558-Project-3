and
impulsive

partial
record
of
their
actions
during
ten
days
of
their
existence
by
john
habberton
the
first
cause
so
far
as
it
can
be
determined
of
the
existence
of
this
book
may
be
found
in
the
following
letter
written
by
my
only
married
sister
and
received
by
me
harry
burton
salesman
of
white
goods
bachelor
aged
and
received
just
as
i
was
trying
to
decide
where
i
should
spend
a
fortnight
vacation
hillcrest
june
dear
harry
remembering
that
you
are
always
complaining
that
you
never
have
a
chance
to
read
and
knowing
that
you
wo
get
it
this
summer
if
you
spend
your
vacation
among
people
of
your
own
set
i
write
to
ask
you
to
come
up
here
i
admit
that
i
am
not
wholly
disinterested
in
inviting
you
the
truth
is
tom
and
i
are
invited
to
spend
a
fortnight
with
my
old
schoolmate
alice
wayne
who
you
know
is
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
though
you
did
obey
me
and
marry
her
before
frank
wayne
appeared
well
we
dying
to
go
for
alice
and
frank
live
in
splendid
style
but
as
they
have
included
our
children
in
their
invitation
and
have
no
children
of
their
own
we
must
leave
budge
and
toddie
at
home
i
no
doubt
they
be
perfectly
safe
for
my
girl
is
a
jewel
and
devoted
to
the
children
but
i
would
feel
a
great
deal
easier
if
there
was
a
man
in
the
house
besides
there
the
silver
and
burglars
are
less
likely
to
break
into
a
house
where
there
a
man
never
mind
about
thanking
me
for
the
compliment
if
you
only
come
up
my
mind
will
be
completely
at
rest
the
children
wo
give
you
the
slightest
trouble
they
the
best
children
in
the
world
everybody
says
so
tom
has
plenty
of
cigars
i
know
for
the
money
i
should
have
had
for
a
new
suit
went
to
pay
his
he
has
some
new
claret
too
that
he
goes
into
ecstasies
over
though
ca
tell
it
from
the
vilest
black
ink
except
by
the
color
our
horses
are
in
splendid
condition
and
so
is
the
garden
you
see
i
do
forget
your
old
passion
for
flowers
and
last
and
best
there
never
were
so
many
handsome
girls
at
hillcrest
as
there
are
among
the
summer
boarders
already
here
the
girls
you
already
are
acquainted
with
here
will
see
that
you
meet
all
the
newer
acquisitions
reply
by
telegraph
right
away
of
course
you
say
in
great
haste
your
loving
sister
helen
you
shall
have
our
own
chamber
it
catches
every
breeze
and
commands
the
finest
views
the
children
room
communicates
with
it
so
if
anything
should
happen
to
the
darlings
at
night
you
be
sure
to
hear
them
just
the
thing
i
ejaculated
five
minutes
later
i
had
telegraphed
helen
my
acceptance
of
her
invitation
and
had
mentally
selected
books
enough
to
busy
me
during
a
dozen
vacations
without
sharing
belief
that
her
boys
were
the
best
ones
in
the
world
i
knew
them
well
enough
to
feel
assured
that
they
would
not
give
me
any
annoyance
there
were
two
of
them
since
baby
phil
died
last
fall
budge
the
elder
was
five
years
of
age
and
had
generally
during
my
flying
visits
to
helen
worn
a
shy
serious
meditative
noble
face
with
great
pure
penetrating
eyes
that
made
me
almost
fear
their
stare
tom
declared
he
was
a
born
philanthropist
or
prophet
and
helen
made
so
free
with
miss
muloch
lines
as
to
sing
ah
the
day
that
thou
goest
budgie
my
boy
toddie
had
seen
but
three
summers
and
was
a
happy
little
with
a
head
full
of
tangled
yellow
hair
and
a
very
pretty
fancy
for
finding
out
sunbeams
and
dancing
in
them
i
had
long
envied
tom
his
horses
his
garden
his
house
and
his
location
and
the
idea
of
controlling
them
for
a
fortnight
was
particularly
delightful
taste
in
cigars
and
claret
i
had
always
respected
while
the
lady
inhabitants
of
hillcrest
were
according
to
my
memory
much
like
those
of
every
other
suburban
village
the
fairest
of
their
sex
three
days
later
i
made
the
hour
and
a
half
trip
between
new
york
and
hillcrest
and
hired
a
hackman
to
drive
me
over
to
tom
half
a
mile
from
my
residence
our
horses
shied
violently
and
the
driver
after
talking
freely
to
them
turned
to
me
and
remarked
that
was
one
of
the
what
was
i
asked
that
little
cuss
that
scared
the
hosses
there
he
is
now
holdin
up
that
piece
of
brushwood
be
just
like
his
cheek
now
to
ask
me
to
let
him
ride
here
he
comes
runnin
wonder
where
is
they
most
generally
travel
together
we
call
the
imps
about
these
parts
because
they
so
uncommon
likely
at
mischief
always
hosses
or
chasin
cows
or
frightenin
chickens
nice
enough
father
an
mother
too
queer
how
young
ones
do
turn
out
as
he
spoke
the
offending
youth
came
panting
beside
our
carriage
and
in
a
very
dirty
and
under
a
straw
hat
with
one
stocking
about
his
ankle
and
two
shoes
averaging
about
two
buttons
each
i
recognized
my
nephew
budge
about
the
same
time
there
emerged
from
the
bushes
by
the
roadside
a
smaller
boy
in
a
green
gingham
dress
a
ruffle
which
might
once
have
been
white
dirty
stockings
blue
slippers
worn
through
at
the
toes
and
an
thrusting
into
the
dust
of
the
road
a
branch
from
a
bush
and
shouting
here
my
he
ran
toward
us
enveloped
in
a
pillar
of
cloud
which
might
have
served
the
purpose
of
israel
in
egypt
when
he
paused
and
the
dust
had
somewhat
subsided
i
beheld
the
unmistakable
lineaments
of
the
child
toddie
they
my
nephews
i
gasped
what
exclaimed
the
driver
by
gracious
i
forgot
you
were
going
to
colonel
lawrence
i
did
tell
anything
but
the
truth
about
though
they
smart
enough
an
good
enough
as
boys
go
but
never
die
of
the
complaint
that
children
has
in
books
budge
said
i
with
all
the
sternness
i
could
command
do
you
know
me
the
searching
eyes
of
the
embryo
prophet
and
philanthropist
scanned
me
for
a
moment
then
their
owner
replied
yes

uncle
harry
did
you
bring
us
anything

us
anything
echoed
toddie
i
wish

farther
ear
was
not
a
yard
from
budge
mouth
uncle
harry
going
to
take
us
riding
going
to
take
us
riding
echoed
toddie
with
the
air
of
one
in
a
reverie
both
the
echo
and
the
reverie
i
soon
learned
were
characteristics
of
toddie
as
they
clambered
into
the
carriage
i
noticed
that
each
one
carried
a
very
dirty
towel
knotted
in
the
center
into
what
is
known
as
a
knot
drawn
very
tight
after
some
moments
of
disgusted
contemplation
of
these
rags
without
being
in
the
least
able
to
comprehend
their
purpose
i
asked
budge
what
those
towels
were
for
they
not
towels
they
dollies
promptly
answered
my
nephew
goodness
i
exclaimed
i

think

my
lap
oh

shouted
budge
hastening
to
occupy
one
knee
and
in
transitu
wiping
his
shoes
on
my
trousers
and
the
skirts
of
my
coat
each
imp
put
an
arm
about
me
to
steady
himself
as
i
produced
my
and
showed
them
the
dial
i

asperity

the
innocent

the
dirty
but
pretty
lips
parted
slightly
and
toddie
murmured
want
to
shee
the
wheels
go
wound
i
abruptly
closed
my
watch
and
put
it
into
my
pocket
instantly
toddie
lower
lip
commenced
to
turn
outward
and
continued
to
do
so
until
i
seriously
feared
the
bony
portion
of
his
chin
would
be
exposed
to
view
then
his
lower
jaw
dropped
and
he
cried
ah

ound

would

see
the
wheels
go
round
as
soon
as
we
get
home
a
carriage
containing
a
couple
of
ladies
was
rapidly
approaching
as
toddie
again
raised
his
voice
ah
h
h
wants
to
shee
wheels
madly
i
snatched
my
watch
from
my
pocket
opened
the
case
and
exposed
the
works
to
view
the
other
carriage
was
meeting
ours
and
i
dropped
my
head
to
avoid
meeting
the
glance
of
the
unknown
occupants
for
my
few
moments
of
contact
with
my
dreadful
nephews
had
made
me
feel
inexpressibly
unneat
suddenly
the
carriage
with
the
ladies
stopped
i
heard
my
own
name
spoken
and
raising
my
head
quickly
encountering
budge
bullet
head
en
route
to
the
serious
disarrangement
of
my
hat
i
looked
into
the
other
carriage
there
erect
fresh
neat
composed
smiling
and
observant
she
would
have
been
all
this
even
if
the
angel
of
the
resurrection
had
just
sounded
his
dreadful
trump
sat
miss
alice
mayton
a
lady
who
for
about
a
year
i
had
been
adoring
from
afar
when
did
you
arrive
mr
burton
she
asked
and
how
long
have
you
been
officiating
as
child
companion
you
certainly
a
trio
so
unconventional
i
hate
to
see
children
all
dressed
up
and
stiff
as
little
manikins
when
they
go
out
to
ride
and
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
having
such
a
good
time
with
them
i
i
assure
you
miss
mayton
said
i
that
my
experience
has
been
the
exact
reverse
of
a
pleasant
one
if
king
herod
were
yet
alive
volunteer
as
an
executioner
and
engage
to
deliver
two
interesting
corpses
at
a
moment
notice
you
dreadful
wretch
exclaimed
the
lady
mother
let
me
make
you
acquainted
with
burton
helen
lawrence
brother
how
is
your
sister
mr
burton
i
do
know
i
replied
she
has
gone
with
her
husband
on
a
fortnight
visit
to
captain
and
wayne
and
i
been
silly
enough
to
promise
to
have
an
eye
to
the
place
while
they
away
why
how
delightful
exclaimed
miss
mayton
such
horses
such
flowers
such
a
cook
and
such
children
said
i
glaring
suggestively
at
the
imps
and
rescuing
from
toddie
a
handkerchief
which
he
had
extracted
from
my
pocket
and
was
waving
to
the
breeze
why
they
the
best
children
in
the
world
helen
told
me
so
the
first
time
i
met
her
this
season
children
will
be
children
you
know
we
had
three
little
cousins
with
us
last
summer
and
i
sure
they
made
me
look
years
older
than
i
really
am
how
young
you
must
be
then
miss
mayton
said
i
suppose
i
looked
at
her
as
if
i
meant
what
i
said
for
although
she
inclined
her
head
and
said
oh
thank
you
she
did
seem
to
turn
my
compliment
off
in
her
usual
invulnerable
style
nothing
happening
in
the
course
of
conversation
ever
discomposed
alice
mayton
for
more
than
a
hundred
seconds
however
so
she
soon
recovered
her
usual
expression
and
as
her
next
remark
fully
indicated
i
believe
you
arranged
the
floral
decorations
at
the
fair
last
winter
burton
was
the
most
tasteful
display
of
the
season
i
do
wish
to
give
any
hints
but
at
clarkson
where
we
boarding
there
not
a
flower
in
the
whole
garden
i
break
the
tenth
commandment
dreadfully
every
time
i
pass
colonel
garden
mr
burton
ah
thank
you
i
shall
be
delighted
of
course
you
call
said
miss
mayton
as
her
carriage
started
it
dreadfully
stupid
here
no
men
except
on
sundays
i
bowed
assent
in
the
contemplation
of
all
the
shy
possibilities
which
my
short
chat
with
miss
mayton
had
suggested
i
had
quite
forgotten
my
dusty
clothing
and
the
two
living
causes
thereof
while
in
miss
mayton
presence
the
imps
had
preserved
perfect
silence
but
now
their
tongues
were
loosened
uncle
harry
said
budge
do
you
know
how
to
make
whistles
ucken
hawwy
murmured
toddie
does
you
love
dat
lady
no
toddie
of
course
not
then
you
baddy
man
an
de
lord
wo
let
you
go
to
heaven
if
you
do
love
peoples
yes
budge
i
answered
hastily
i
do
know
how
to
make
whistles
and
you
shall
have
one
lord
do
like
mans
what
do
love
peoples
reiterated
toddie
all
right
toddie
said
i
i
see
if
i
ca
please
the
lord
some
way
driver
whip
up
wo
you
i
in
a
hurry
to
turn
these
youngsters
over
to
the
girl
and
ask
her
to
drop
them
into
the
i
found
helen
had
made
every
possible
arrangement
for
my
comfort
her
room
commanded
exquisite
views
of
and
valley
and
even
the
fact
that
the
imps
bedroom
adjoined
mine
gave
me
comfort
for
i
thought
of
the
pleasure
of
contemplating
them
while
they
were
asleep
and
beyond
the
power
of
tormenting
their
deluded
uncle
at
the
budge
and
toddie
appeared
cleanly
clothed
in
their
rightful
faces
budge
seated
himself
at
the
table
toddie
pushed
back
his
climbed
into
it
and
shouted
put
my
legs
under
ze
tabo
rightfully
construing
this
remark
as
a
request
to
be
moved
to
the
table
i
fulfilled
his
desire
the
girl
poured
tea
for
me
and
milk
for
the
children
and
retired
and
then
i
remembered
to
my
dismay
that
helen
never
had
a
servant
in
the
except
upon
grand
occasions
her
idea
being
that
servants
retail
to
their
friends
the
cream
of
the
private
conversation
of
the
family
circle
in
principle
i
agreed
with
her
but
the
penalty
of
the
practical
application
with
these
two
little
cormorants
on
my
hands
was
greater
suffering
than
any
i
had
ever
been
called
upon
to
endure
for
principle
sake
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
resignedly
rapped
on
the
table
bowed
my
head
said
from
what
we
are
about
to
receive
the
lord
make
us
thankful
and
asked
budge
whether
he
ate
bread
or
biscuit
why
we
ai
asked
no
blessin
yet
said
he
yes
i
did
budge
said
i
did
you
hear
me
do
you
mean
what
you
said
just
now
yes
oh
i
do
think
that
was
no
blessin
at
all
papa
never
says
that
kind
of
a
blessin
what
does
papa
say
may
i
ask
i
inquired
with
becoming
meekness
why
papa
says
father
we
thank
thee
for
this
food
mercifully
remember
with
us
all
the
hungry
and
needy
for
christ
sake
amen
that
what
he
says
it
means
the
same
thing
budge
do
think
it
does
and
toddie
did
have
no
time
to
say
his
blessin
i
do
think
the
lord
like
it
if
you
do
it
that
way
yes
he
will
old
boy
he
knows
what
people
mean
well
how
can
he
tell
what
toddie
means
if
toddie
ca
say
anything
wantsh
to
shay
my
blessin
whined
toddie
it
was
enough
my
single
encounter
with
toddie
had
taught
me
to
respect
the
young
gentleman
force
of
character
so
again
i
bowed
my
head
and
repeated
what
budge
had
reported
as
papa
blessin
budge
kindly
prompting
me
where
my
memory
failed
the
moment
i
began
toddie
commenced
to
jabber
rapidly
and
aloud
and
the
instant
the
amen
was
pronounced
he
raised
his
head
and
remarked
with
evident
satisfaction
i
shed
my
blessin
two
timesh
and
budge
said
gravely
now
i
guess
we
are
all
right
the
supper
was
an
exquisite
one
but
the
appetites
of
those
dreadful
children
effectually
prevented
my
enjoying
the
repast
i
hastily
retired
called
the
girl
and
instructed
her
to
see
that
the
children
had
enough
to
eat
and
were
put
to
bed
immediately
after
then
i
lit
a
cigar
and
strolled
into
the
garden
the
roses
were
just
in
bloom
the
air
was
full
of
the
perfume
of
honeysuckles
the
rhododendrons
had
not
disappeared
while
i
saw
promise
of
the
early
unfolding
of
many
other
pet
flowers
of
mine
i
confess
that
i
took
a
careful
survey
of
the
garden
to
see
how
fine
a
bouquet
i
might
make
for
miss
mayton
and
was
so
abundantly
satisfied
with
the
material
before
me
that
i
longed
to
begin
the
work
at
once
but
that
it
would
seem
too
hasty
for
true
gentility
so
i
paced
the
paths
my
hands
behind
my
back
and
my
face
well
hidden
by
fragrant
clouds
of
smoke
and
went
into
wondering
and
reveries
i
wondered
if
there
was
any
sense
in
the
language
of
flowers
of
which
i
had
occasionally
seen
mention
made
by
silly
writers
i
wished
i
had
learned
it
if
it
had
any
meaning
i
wondered
if
miss
mayton
understood
it
at
any
rate
i
fancied
i
could
arrange
flowers
to
the
taste
of
any
lady
whose
face
i
had
ever
seen
and
for
alice
mayton
i
would
make
something
so
superb
that
her
face
could
not
help
lighting
up
when
she
beheld
it
i
imagined
just
how
her
eyes
would
brighten
her
cheeks
would
redden
not
with
sentiment
not
a
bit
of
it
but
with
genuine
pleasure
how
her
strong
lips
would
part
slightly
and
disclose
sweet
lines
not
displayed
when
she
held
her
features
well
in
hand
i
i
a
driving
successful
salesman
of
white
goods
actually
wished
i
might
be
divested
of
all
abilities
and
characteristics
and
be
one
of
those
fairies
that
only
silly
girls
and
crazy
poets
think
of
and
might
unseen
behold
the
meeting
of
my
flowers
with
this
highly
cultivated
specimen
of
the
only
sort
of
flowers
our
cities
produce
what
flower
did
she
most
resemble
a
lily
no
too
not
exactly
too
bold
but
too
too
well
i
think
of
the
word
but
clearly
it
was
bold
a
rose
certainly
not
like
those
glorious
but
blazing
remontants
nor
yet
like
the
shy
delicate
ethereal
with
their
tender
suggestions
of
color
like
this
perfect
gloire
de
dijon
perhaps
strong
vigorous
among
its
more
delicate
sisterhood
yet
shapely
perfect
in
outline
and
development
exquisite
enchanting
in
its
never
tints
yet
compelling
the
admiration
of
every
one
and
recalling
its
admirers
again
and
again
by
the
unspoken
appeal
of
its
own
perfection
its
unvarying
radiance
ah
h
h
h
ee
ee
ee
ee
ee
oo
oo
oo
oo
came
from
the
window
over
my
head
then
came
a
shout
of
uncle
harry
in
a
voice
i
recognized
as
that
of
budge
i
made
no
reply
there
are
moments
when
the
soul
is
full
of
utterances
unfit
to
be
heard
by
childish
ears
uncle
repeated
budge
then
i
heard
a
open
and
budge
exclaiming
uncle
harry
we
want
you
to
come
and
tell
us
stories
i
turned
my
eyes
upward
quickly
and
was
about
to
send
a
savage
negative
in
the
same
direction
when
i
saw
in
the
window
a
face
unknown
and
yet
remembered
could
those
great
wistful
eyes
that
angelic
mouth
that
spiritual
expression
belong
to
my
nephew
budge
yes
it
must
be
certainly
that
nose
and
those
enormous
ears
never
belonged
to
any
one
else
i
turned
abruptly
and
entered
the
house
and
was
received
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
by
two
little
figures
in
white
the
larger
of
which
remarked
we
want
you
tell
us
stories
papa
always
does
nights
very
well
jump
into
bed
what
kind
of
stories
do
you
like
oh
jonah
said
budge
jonah
echoed
toddie
well
jonah
was
out
in
the
sun
one
day
and
a
grew
up
all
of
a
sudden
and
made
it
nice
and
shady
for
him
and
then
it
all
faded
as
quick
as
it
came
a
dead
silence
prevailed
for
a
moment
and
then
budge
indignantly
remarked
that
ai
jonah
a
bit
know
jonah
oh
you
do
do
you
said
i
then
maybe
you
be
so
good
as
to
enlighten
me
huh
if
you
know
about
jonah
tell
me
the
story
i
really
enjoy
listening
to
it
well
said
budge
once
upon
a
time
the
lord
told
jonah
to
go
to
nineveh
and
tell
the
people
they
was
all
bad
but
jonah
did
want
to
go
so
he
went
on
a
boat
that
was
going
to
joppa
and
then
there
was
a
big
storm
an
it
rained
an
blowed
and
the
big
waves
went
as
high
as
a
house
an
the
sailors
thought
there
must
be
somebody
on
the
boat
that
the
lord
did
like
an
jonah
said
he
guessed
he
was
the
man
so
they
picked
him
up
and
froed
him
in
the
ocean
an
i
do
think
it
was
well
for
to
do
that
after
jonah
told
the
troof
an
a
big
whale
was
comin
along
and
he
was
awful
hungry
cos
the
little
fishes
what
he
likes
to
eat
all
went
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
when
it
began
to
storm
and
whales
ca
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
cos
they
have
to
come
up
to
breeve
an
little
fishes
do
an
jonah
found
was
all
dark
inside
the
whale
and
there
was
any
fire
there
an
it
was
all
wet
and
he
could
take
off
his
clothes
to
dry
cos
there
was
no
place
to
hang
an
there
was
no
windows
to
look
out
of
nor
nothin
to
eat
nor
nothin
nor
nothin
nor
nothin
so
he
asked
the
lord
to
let
mm
out
an
the
lord
was
sorry
for
him
an
he
made
the
whale
go
up
close
to
the
land
an
jonah
jumped
right
out
of
his
mouth
an
was
he
glad
an
then
he
went
to
nineveh
an
done
what
the
lord
told
him
to
and
he
ought
to
have
done
it
in
the
first
place
if
he
had
known
what
was
good
for
him
done
first
payshe
know
what
dood
for
him
asserted
toddie
in
support
of
his
brother
assertion
tell
us
story
oh
no
sing
us
a
song
suggested
budge
shing
us
shong
echoed
toddie
i
searched
my
mind
for
a
song
but
the
only
one
which
came
promptly
was
several
bars
of
which
i
gave
my
juvenile
audience
when
budge
interrupted
me
saying
i
do
think
that
a
very
good
song
why
not
budge
cos
i
do
i
do
know
a
word
what
you
talking
shing
glory
hallelulyah
suggested
toddie
and
i
meekly
obeyed
the
old
air
has
a
wonderful
influence
over
me
i
heard
it
in
western
and
when
i
was
a
boy
i
saw
the
massachusetts
march
down
broadway
singing
the
same
air
during
the
rush
to
the
front
during
the
early
days
of
the
war
i
have
heard
it
sung
by
warrior
tongues
in
nearly
every
southern
state
i
heard
it
roared
by
three
hundred
good
old
hunker
democrats
as
they
escorted
new
york
first
colored
regiment
to
their
place
of
embarkation
my
old
brigade
sang
it
softly
but
with
a
swing
that
was
terrible
in
its
earnestness
as
they
lay
behind
their
stacks
of
arms
just
before
going
to
action
i
have
heard
it
played
over
the
grave
of
many
a
dead
comrade
the
the
cavalry
became
peaceful
and
patriotic
again
as
their
played
the
old
air
after
having
asked
permission
to
try
his
hand
on
them
it
is
the
same
that
burst
forth
spontaneously
in
our
barracks
on
that
glorious
morning
when
we
learned
that
the
war
was
over
and
it
was
sung
with
words
adapted
to
the
occasion
by
some
good
rebel
friends
of
mine
on
our
first
social
meeting
after
the
war
all
these
recollections
came
hurrying
into
my
mind
as
i
sang
and
probably
excited
me
beyond
my
knowledge
for
budge
suddenly
remarked
do
sing
that
all
day
uncle
harry
you
sing
so
loud
it
hurts
my
head
beg
your
pardon
budge
said
i
why

did
hear
us
say
our
prayers

always
does
oh
well
go
ahead
you
must
say
yours
first
said
budge
that
the
way
papa
does
very
well
said
i
and
i
repeated
chrysostom
prayer
from
the
episcopal
service
i
had
hardly
said
amen
when
budge
remarked
my
papa
do
say
any
of
them
things
at
all
i
do
think
that
a
very
good
prayer
well
you
say
a
good
prayer
budge
allright
budge
shut
his
eyes
dropped
his
voice
to
the
most
perfect
tone
of
supplication
while
his
face
seemed
fit
for
a
sleeping
angel
then
he
said
dear
lord

thank
you

closed
his
eyes
wriggled
twisted
breathed
hard
and
quick
acting
generally
as
if
prayers
were
principally
a
matter
of
physical
exertion
at
last
he
began

hastily

the
candy
from
my
trunk

some
to
each
boy
the
recipients
fairly
shrieking
with
delight
and
once
more
said

toddie

knotted
towels

the
dirty
things
up
gingerly
and
threw
them
upon
the
bed
now
want
to
shee
wheels
go
wound
said
toddie
i
hurried
out
of
the
room
and
slammed
the
door
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
eight
i
had
spent
an
hour
and
a
half
with
those
dreadful
children
they
were
funny
to
be
sure
i
found
myself
laughing
in
spite
of
my
indignation
still
if
they
were
to
monopolize
my
time
as
they
had
already
done
when
was
i
to
do
my
reading
taking
fiske
cosmic
philosophy
from
my
trunk
i
descended
to
the
back
parlor
lit
a
cigar
and
a
and
began
to
read
i
had
not
fairly
commenced
when
i
heard
a
patter
of
small
feet
and
saw
my
elder
nephew
before
me
there
was
sorrowful
protestation
in
every
line
of
his
countenance
as
he
exclaimed
you
did
say
nor
bless
you
nor
anything
oh
god
bless
you
god
bless
you
budge
seemed
waiting
for
something
else
at
last
he
said
papa
says
bless
everybody
well
god
bless
everybody
god
bless
everybody
responded
budge
and
turned
silently
and
went
bless
your
tormenting
honest
little
heart
i
said
to
myself
if
men
trusted
god
as
you
do
your
papa
how
little
business
there
be
for
preachers
to
do
the
night
was
a
perfect
one
the
pure
fresh
air
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
the
music
of
the
insect
choir
in
the
trees
and
shrubbery
the
very
season
itself
seemed
to
forbid
my
reading
philosophy
so
i
laid
fiske
aside
delighted
myself
with
a
few
rare
bits
from
paul
new
volume
of
poems
read
a
few
chapters
of
one
summer
and
finally
sauntered
off
to
bed
my
nephews
were
slumbering
sweetly
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
pure
exquisite
angelic
faces
before
me
belonged
to
my
tormentors
of
a
few
hours
before
as
i
lay
on
my
couch
i
could
see
the
dark
shadow
and
rugged
crest
of
the
mountain
above
it
the
silver
stars
against
the
blue
and
below
it
the
rival
lights
of
the
fireflies
against
the
dark
background
formed
by
the
mountain
itself
no
rumbling
of
wheels
tormented
me
nor
any
of
the
thousand
noises
that
fill
city
air
with
the
spirit
of
unrest
and
i
fell
into
a
wonder
almost
indignant
that
sensible
comfortable
loving
beings
could
live
in
horrible
new
york
while
such
delightful
rural
homes
were
so
near
at
hand
then
alice
mayton
came
into
my
mind
and
then
a
customer
later
stars
and
trademarks
and
bouquets
and
dirty
nephews
and
fireflies
and
bad
accounts
and
railway
tickets
and
candy
and
herbert
spencer
mixed
themselves
confusingly
in
my
mind
then
a
vision
of
a
proud
angel
in
the
most
fashionable
attire
and
a
modern
carriage
came
and
banished
them
all
by
its
perfect
radiance
and
i
was
sinking
in
the
most
blissful
unconsciousness
ah
h
h
h
h
h
oo

hissed

way

out
of
them
toddie
clutched

his
whole

up
with
affectionate
delight
and
he
screamed

dee
dolly
tum
to
your
own
papa
dolly
an
i
love
you
and
that
ridiculous
child
was
so
completely
satisfied
by
his
outlay
of
affection
that
my
own
indignation
gave
place
to
genuine
artistic
pleasure
one
can
tire
of
even
beautiful
pictures
though
when
he
is
not
fully
awake
and
is
holding
a
candle
in
a
draught
of
air
so
i
covered
my
nephews
and
returned
to
my
own
room
where
i
mused
upon
the
contradictoriness
of
childhood
until
i
fell
asleep
in
the
morning
i
was
awakened
very
early
by
the
light
streaming
in
the
window
the
blinds
of
which
i
had
left
open
the
night
before
the
air
was
alive
with
and
the
eastern
sky
was
flushing
with
tints
which
no
painter
canvas
ever
caught
but
skies
and
songs
are
not
fit
subjects
for
the
continued
contemplation
of
men
who
read
until
midnight
so
i
hastily
closed
the
blinds
drew
the
shade
dropped
the
curtains
and
lay
down
again
dreamily
thanking
heaven
that
i
was
to
fall
asleep
to
such
exquisite
music
i
am
sure
that
i
mentally
forgave
all
my
enemies
as
i
dropped
off
into
a
most
delicious
doze
but
the
sudden
realization
that
a
light
hand
was
passing
over
my
cheek
roused
me
to
savage
anger
in
an
instant
i
sprang
up
and
saw
budge
shrink
timidly
away
from
my
bedside
i
was
only
you
cos
you
was
good
and
brought
us
candy
papa
lets
us
love
him
whenever
we
want
to
every
morning
he
does
as
early
as
this
demanded
i
yes
just
as
soon
as
we
can
see
if
we
want
to
poor
tom
i
never
could
comprehend
why
with
a
good
wife
a
comfortable
income
and
a
clear
conscience
he
need
always
look
thin
and
worn
worse
than
he
ever
did
in
virginia
woods
or
louisiana
swamps
but
now
i
knew
all
and
yet
what
could
one
do
that
child
eyes
and
voice
and
his
expression
which
exceeded
in
sweetness
that
of
any
of
the
angels
i
had
ever
imagined
that
child
could
coax
a
man
to
do
more
deeds
than
the
shortening
of
his
precious
amounted
to
in
fact
he
was
fast
divesting
me
of
my
rightful
sleepiness
so
i
kissed
him
and
said
run
to
bed
now
dear
old
fellow
and
let
uncle
go
to
sleep
again
after
breakfast
i
make
you
a
whistle
oh
will
you
the
angel
turned
into
a
boy
at
once
yes
now
run
along
a
loud
whistle
a
real
loud
one
yes
but
not
if
you
do
go
right
back
to
bed
the
sound
of
little
footsteps
receded
as
i
turned
over
and
closed
my
eyes
speedily
the
seemed
to
grow
fainter
my
thoughts
dropped
to
pieces
i
seemed
to
be
floating
on
fleecy
clouds
in
company
with
hundreds
of
cherubs
with
budge
features
and
uncle
harry
may
the
lord
forget
the
prayer
i
put
up
just
then
uncle
harry
i
discipline
you
my
fine
little
boy
thought
i
perhaps
if
i
let
you
shriek
your
abominable
little
throat
hoarse
you
learn
better
than
to
torment
your
uncle
that
was
just
getting
ready
to
love
you
dearly
uncle
howl
away
you
little
imp
thought
i
you
got
me
wide
awake
and
your
lungs
may
suffer
for
it
suddenly
i
heard
although
in
sleepy
tones
and
with
a
lazy
drawl
some
words
which
appalled
me
the
murmurer
was
toddie
want
she
wheels
go
wound
budge
i
shouted
in
the
desperation
of
my
dread
lest
toddie
too
might
wake
up
what
do
you
want
uncle
harry
what
uncle
harry
what
kind
of
wood
are
you
going
to
make
the
whistle
out
of
i
wo
make
any
at
all
i
cut
a
big
stick
and
give
you
a
sound
whipping
with
it
for
not
keeping
quiet
as
i
told
you
to
why
uncle
harry
papa
do
whip
us
with
sticks
he
spanks
us
heavens
papa
papa
papa
was
i
never
to
have
done
with
this
eternal
quotation
of
papa
i
was
horrified
to
find
myself
gradually
conceiving
a
dire
hatred
of
my
excellent
one
thing
was
certain
at
any
rate
sleep
was
no
longer
possible
so
i
hastily
dressed
and
went
into
the
garden
among
the
beauty
and
the
fragrance
of
the
flowers
and
in
the
delicious
morning
air
i
succeeded
in
regaining
my
temper
and
was
delighted
on
answering
the
two
hours
later
to
have
budge
accost
me
with
why
uncle
harry
where
was
you
we
looked
all
over
the
house
for
you
and
could
find
a
speck
of
you
the
breakfast
was
an
excellent
one
i
afterward
learned
that
helen
dear
old
girl
had
herself
prepared
a
bill
of
fare
for
every
meal
i
should
take
in
the
house
as
the
table
talk
of
myself
and
nephews
was
not
such
as
could
do
harm
by
being
repeated
i
requested
maggie
the
servant
to
wait
upon
the
children
and
i
accompanied
my
request
with
a
small
treasury
note
relieved
thus
of
all
responsibility
for
the
dreadful
appetites
of
my
nephews
i
did
full
justice
to
the
repast
and
even
regarded
with
some
interest
and
amusement
the
industry
of
budge
and
toddie
with
their
tiny
forks
and
spoons
they
ate
rapidly
for
a
while
but
soon
their
appetites
weakened
and
their
tongues
were
unloosed
ocken
hawwy
remarked
toddie
daysh
an
awfoo
funny
chunt
up
awfoo
big
chunt
i
show
it
you
after
brepspup
toddie
a
silly
little
boy
said
budge
he
always
says
brepspup
for
brekbux
footnote
breakfast
oh
what
does
he
mean
by
chunt
budge
i
guess
he
means
trunk
replied
my
oldest
nephew
recollections
of
my
childish
delight
in
rummaging
an
old
trunk
it
seems
a
century
ago
that
i
did
it
caused
me
to
smile
sympathetically
at
toddie
to
his
apparent
great
delight
how
delightful
it
is
to
strike
a
sympathetic
chord
in
thought
i
how
quickly
the
infant
eye
comprehends
the
look
which
precedes
the
verbal
expression
of
an
idea
dear
toddie
for
years
we
might
sit
at
one
table
careless
of
each
other
words
but
the
casual
mention
of
one
of
thy
delights
has
suddenly
brought
our
souls
into
that
sweetest
of
all
human
communions
that
one
which
doubtless
bound
the
master
himself
to
that
apostle
who
was
otherwise
apparently
the
weakest
among
the
chosen
twelve
an
awfoo
funny
chunt
seemed
to
annihilate
suddenly
all
differences
of
age
condition
and
experience
between
the
wee
boy
and
myself
and
a
direful
thought
struck
me
i
dashed
and
into
my
room
yes
he
did
mean
my
trunk
could
see
nothing
funny
about
it
quite
the
contrary
the
bond
of
sympathy
between
my
nephew
and
myself
was
suddenly
broken
looking
at
the
matter
from
the
comparative
distance
which
a
few
weeks
have
placed
between
that
day
and
this
i
can
see
that
i
was
unable
to
consider
the
scene
before
me
with
a
calm
and
unprejudiced
mind
i
am
now
satisfied
that
the
sudden
birth
and
hasty
decease
of
my
sympathy
with
toddie
were
striking
instances
of
human
inconsistency
my
soul
had
gone
out
to
his
because
he
loved
to
rummage
in
trunks
and
because
i
imagined
he
loved
to
see
the
monument
of
incongruous
material
which
resulted
from
such
an
operation
the
scene
before
me
showed
clearly
that
i
had
rightly
divined
my
nephew
nature
and
yet
my
selfish
instincts
hastened
to
obscure
my
soul
vision
and
to
prevent
that
joy
which
should
ensue
when
faith
is
lost
in
full
fruition
my
trunk
had
contained
nearly
everything
for
while
a
campaigner
i
had
learned
to
reduce
packing
to
an
exact
science
now
had
there
been
an
atom
of
pride
in
my
composition
i
might
have
glorified
myself
for
it
certainly
seemed
as
if
the
heap
upon
the
floor
could
never
have
come
out
of
a
single
trunk
clearly
toddie
was
more
of
a
general
connoisseur
than
an
amateur
in
packing
the
method
of
his
work
i
quickly
discerned
and
the
discovery
threw
some
light
upon
the
size
of
the
heap
in
front
of
my
trunk
a
and
its
case
when
their
natural
relationship
is
dissolved
occupy
nearly
twice
as
much
space
as
before
even
if
the
former
contains
a
not
usually
kept
in
it
and
the
latter
contains
a
few
cigars
soaking
in
bay
rum
the
same
might
be
said
of
a
portable
and
its
contents
bought
for
me
in
vienna
by
a
brother
and
designed
by
an
old
continental
campaigner
to
be
perfection
itself
the
straps
which
prevented
the
cover
from
falling
entirely
back
had
been
cut
broken
or
parted
in
some
way
and
in
its
hollow
lay
my
dresscoat
tightly
rolled
up
snatching
it
up
with
a
violent
exclamation
and
unrolling
it
there
dropped
from
it
one
of
those
infernal
dolls
at
the
same
time
a
howl
was
sounded
from
the
doorway
you
tookted
my
dolly
out
of
her
cradle
i
want
to
wock
my
dolly
oo
oo
oo
ee
ee
ee
you
young
scoundrel
i
screamed
yes
howled
i
was
so
enraged
a
great
mind
to
cut
your
throat
this
minute
what
do
you
mean
by
meddling
with
my
trunk
i
doe
know
outward
turned
toddie
lower
lip
i
believe
the
sight
of
it
would
move
a
bengal
tiger
to
pity
but
no
such
thought
occurred
to
me
just
then
what
made
you
do
it
be
cause
because
what
i
doe
know
just
then
a
terrific
roar
arose
from
the
garden
looking
out
i
saw
budge
with
a
bleeding
finger
upon
one
hand
and
my
razor
in
the
other
he
afterward
explained
he
had
been
making
a
boat
and
that
knife
was
bad
to
him
to
apply
adhesive
plaster
to
the
cut
was
the
work
of
but
a
minute
and
i
had
barely
completed
this
surgical
operation
when
appeared
and
handed
me
a
letter
it
was
addressed
in
helen
hand
and
read
as
follows
the
passages
in
brackets
were
my
own
comments
bloomdale
june
dear
harry
i
very
happy
in
the
thought
that
you
are
with
my
darling
children
and
although
i
having
a
lovely
time
here
i
often
wish
i
was
with
you
ump
so
do
i
i
want
you
to
know
the
little
treasures
real
well
thank
you
but
i
do
think
i
care
to
extend
the
acquaintanceship
farther
than
is
absolutely
necessary
it
seems
to
me
so
unnatural
that
relatives
know
so
little
of
those
of
their
own
blood
and
especially
of
the
innocent
little
spirits
whose
existence
is
almost
unheeded
not
when
there
unlocked
trunks
standing
about
sis
now
i
want
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
when
we
were
boys
and
girls
at
home
you
used
to
talk
perfect
oceans
about
physiognomy
and
phrenology
and
unerring
signs
of
character
i
thought
it
was
all
nonsense
then
but
if
you
believe
any
of
it
now
i
wish
you
study
the
children
and
give
me
your
opinion
of
them
perfect
demons
imps
rascals
born
to
be
hung
both
of
them
i
ca
get
over
the
feeling
that
dear
budge
is
born
for
something
grand
grand
nuisance
he
is
sometimes
so
thoughtful
and
so
absorbed
that
i
almost
fear
the
result
of
disturbing
him
then
he
has
that
faculty
of
perseverance
which
seems
to
be
the
thing
some
men
have
lacked
to
make
them
great
he
certainly
has
it
he
exemplified
it
while
i
was
trying
to
get
to
sleep
this
morning
toddie
is
going
to
make
a
poet
or
a
musician
or
an
artist
that
so
all
abominable
scamps
take
to
some
artistic
pursuit
as
an
excuse
for
loafing
his
fancies
take
hold
of
him
very
strongly
they
do
they
do
shee
wheels
go
wound
for
instance
he
has
not
budgie
sublime
earnestness
but
he
does
need
it
the
irresistible
force
with
which
he
is
drawn
toward
whatever
is
beautiful
compensates
for
the
lack
ah
perhaps
that
explains
his
operation
with
my
trunk
but
i
want
your
own
opinion
for
i
know
you
make
more
careful
distinction
in
character
than
i
do
delighting
myself
with
the
idea
that
i
deserve
most
of
the
credit
for
the
lots
of
reading
you
will
have
done
by
this
time
and
hoping
i
shall
soon
have
a
line
telling
me
how
my
darlings
are
i
am
as
ever
your
loving
sister
helen
seldom
have
i
been
so
roused
by
a
letter
as
i
was
by
this
one
and
never
did
i
promise
myself
more
genuine
pleasure
in
writing
a
reply
i
determined
that
it
should
be
a
masterpiece
of
analysis
and
of
calm
yet
forcible
expression
of
opinion
upon
one
step
at
any
rate
i
was
positively
determined
calling
the
girl
i
asked
her
where
the
key
was
that
locked
the
door
between
my
room
and
the
children
please
sir
toddie
threw
it
down
the
well
is
there
a
locksmith
in
the
village
no
sir
the
nearest
one
is
at
paterson
is
there
a
screwdriver
in
the
house
yes
sir
bring
it
to
me
and
tell
the
coachman
to
get
ready
at
once
to
drive
me
to
paterson
the
screwdriver
was
brought
and
with
it
i
removed
the
lock
got
into
the
carriage
and
told
the
driver
to
take
me
to
paterson
by
the
one
of
the
most
beautiful
roads
in
america
paterson
exclaimed
budge
oh
there
a
in
that
town
come
on
toddie
will
you
thought
i
snatching
the
whip
and
giving
the
horses
a
cut
not
if
can
help
it
the
idea
of
having
such
a
drive
spoiled
by
the
clatter
of
such
a
couple
away
went
the
horses
and
up
rose
a
piercing
shriek
and
a
terrible
roar
it
seemed
that
both
children
must
have
been
mortally
hurt
and
i
looked
out
hastily
only
to
see
budge
and
toddie
running
after
the
carriage
and
crying
pitifully
it
was
too
pitiful
i
could
not
have
proceeded
without
them
even
if
they
had
been
afflicted
with
the
driver
stopped
of
his
own
accord
he
seemed
to
know
the
ways
and
their
results
and
i
helped
budge
and
toddie
in
meekly
hoping
that
the
eye
of
providence
was
upon
me
and
that
so
an
act
would
be
duly
passed
to
my
credit
as
we
reached
the
my
kindness
to
my
nephews
seemed
to
assume
greater
proportions
for
the
view
before
me
was
inexpressibly
beautiful
the
air
was
perfectly
clear
and
across
two
score
towns
i
saw
the
great
metropolis
itself
the
silent
city
of
greenwood
beyond
it
the
bay
the
narrows
the
sound
the
two
silvery
rivers
lying
between
me
and
the
palisades
and
even
across
and
to
the
south
of
brooklyn
the
ocean
itself
wonderful
effects
of
light
and
shadow
picturesque
masses
composed
of
detached
buildings
so
far
distant
that
they
seemed
huddled
together
grim
factories
turned
to
beautiful
palaces
by
the
dazzling
reflection
of
sunlight
from
their
great
ships
seeming
in
the
distance
to
be
floating
idly
with
no
sign
of
life
perceptible
the
whole
scene
recalled
the
fairy
stories
read
in
my
youthful
days
of
enchanted
cities
and
the
illusion
was
greatly
strengthened
by
the
shape
of
the
roof
of
new
york
new
lying
in
the
center
of
everything
and
seeming
to
brood
over
all
uncle
harry
ah
that
was
what
i
expected
uncle
harry
well
budge
i
always
think
that
looks
like
heaven
what
does
why
all
that
from
here
over
to
that
other
sky
way
back
there
behind
everything
i
mean
and
i
think
that
here
he
pointed
toward
what
probably
was
a
photographer
that
place
where
it
so
shiny
is
where
god
stays
bless
the
child
the
scene
had
suggested
only
elfindom
to
me
and
yet
i
prided
myself
on
my
quick
sense
of
artistic
effects
an
over
there
where
that
awful
bright
little
speck
is
continued
budge
that
where
dear
little
brother
phillie
is
whenever
i
look
over
there
i
see
him
putting
his
hand
out
dee
phillie
went
to
in
a
box
and
the
lord
took
him
to
heaven
murmured
toddie
putting
together
all
he
had
seen
and
heard
of
death
then
he
raised
his
voice
and
exclaimed
ocken
hawwy
you
know
what
goin
do
when
i
be
big
man
goin
to
have
hosses
and
tarridge
an

though
very
true

said
i
remembering
my
trunk
and
the
object
of
my
ride
uncle
harry
did
you
ever
see
the
lord
no
budge
he
has
been
very
close
to
me
a
good
many
times
but
i
never
saw
him
well
have
i
see
him
every
time
i
look
up
in
the
sky
and
there
ai
nobody
me
the
driver
crossed
himself
and
whispered
he
foriver
that
an
be
the
powers
i
belave
him
sometimes
ye
think
that
the
howly
saints
thimselves
was
whin
that
bye
gits
to
goin
on
that
way
it
was
wonderful
budge
countenance
seemed
too
pure
to
be
of
the
earth
as
he
continued
to
express
his
ideas
of
the
better
land
and
its
denizens
as
for
toddie
his
tongue
was
going
incessantly
although
in
a
tone
scarcely
audible
but
when
i
chanced
to
catch
his
expressions
they
were
so
droll
and
fanciful
that
i
took
him
upon
my
lap
that
i
might
hear
him
more
distinctly
i
even
detected
myself
in
the
act
of
examining
the
mental
draft
of
my
proposed
letter
to
helen
and
of
being
ashamed
of
it
but
neither
toddie
fancy
nor
spirituality
caused
me
to
forget
the
principal
object
of
my
ride
i
found
a
locksmith
and
left
the
lock
to
be
fitted
with
a
key
then
we
drove
to
the
falls
both
boys
discharged
volleys
of
questions
as
we
stood
by
the
gorge
and
the
fact
that
the
roar
of
the
falling
water
prevented
me
from
hearing
them
did
not
cause
them
to
relax
their
efforts
in
the
least
i
walked
to
the
hotel
for
a
cigar
taking
the
children
with
me
i
certainly
spent
no
more
than
three
minutes
in
selecting
and
lighting
a
cigar
and
asking
the
barkeeper
a
few
questions
about
the
falls
but
when
i
turned
the
children
were
missing
nor
could
i
see
them
in
any
direction
suddenly
before
my
eyes
arose
from
the
nearer
brink
of
the
gorge
two
yellowish
disks
which
i
recognized
as
the
hats
of
my
nephews
then
i
saw
between
the
disks
and
me
two
small
figures
lying
upon
the
ground
i
was
afraid
to
shout
for
fear
of
scaring
them
if
they
happened
to
hear
me
i
bounded
across
the
grass
industriously
raving
and
praying
by
turns
they
were
lying
on
their
stomachs
and
looking
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
i
approached
them
on
threw
myself
upon
the
ground
and
grasped
a
foot
of
each
child
oh
uncle
harry
screamed
budge
in
my
ear
as
i
dragged
him
close
to
me
kissing
and
shaking
him
alternately
i
hunged
over
more
than
toddie
did
well
i
i
i
i
i
i
i
hunged
over
a
good
deal
any
how
said
toddie
in
that
afternoon
i
devoted
to
making
a
bouquet
for
miss
mayton
and
a
most
delightful
occupation
i
found
it
it
was
no
florist
bouquet
composed
of
only
a
few
kinds
of
flowers
wired
upon
sticks
and
arranged
according
to
geometric
pattern
i
used
many
a
rare
flower
too
shy
of
bloom
to
recommend
itself
to
florists
i
combined
tints
almost
as
numerous
as
the
flowers
were
and
perfumes
to
which
city
bouquets
are
utter
strangers
arranging
flowers
is
a
favorite
pastime
of
mine
but
upon
this
particular
occasion
i
enjoyed
my
work
more
than
i
had
ever
done
before
not
that
i
was
in
love
with
miss
mayton
a
man
may
honestly
and
strongly
admire
a
handsome
brilliant
woman
without
being
in
love
with
her
he
can
delight
himself
in
trying
to
give
her
pleasure
without
feeling
it
necessary
that
she
shall
give
him
herself
in
return
since
i
arrived
at
years
of
discretion
i
have
always
smiled
sarcastically
at
the
mention
of
the
generosity
of
men
who
were
in
love
they
have
seemed
to
me
rather
to
be
asking
an
immense
price
for
what
they
offered
i
had
no
such
feeling
toward
miss
mayton
there
have
been
heathens
who
have
offered
gifts
to
goddesses
out
of
pure
adoration
and
without
any
idea
of
ever
having
the
exclusive
companionship
of
their
favorite
divinities
i
never
offered
miss
mayton
any
attention
which
did
not
put
me
into
closer
sympathy
with
these
same
old
pagans
and
with
such
christians
as
follow
their
good
example
with
each
new
grace
my
bouquet
took
on
my
pleasure
and
satisfaction
increased
at
the
thought
of
how
she
would
enjoy
the
completed
evidence
of
my
taste
at
length
it
was
finished
but
my
delight
suddenly
became
clouded
by
the
dreadful
thought
what
will
folks
say
had
we
been
in
new
york
instead
of
hillcrest
no
one
but
the
florist
his
messenger
the
lady
and
myself
would
know
if
i
sent
a
bouquet
to
miss
mayton
but
in
hillcrest
with
its
several
hundred
gossips
and
its
acquaintance
of
everybody
with
everybody
else
and
their
affairs
i
feared
talk
upon
the
discretion
of
mike
the
coachman
i
could
safely
rely
i
had
already
confidentially
conveyed
sundry
bits
of
fractional
currency
to
him
and
informed
him
of
one
of
the
parties
at
our
store
whose
family
mike
had
known
in
old
erin
but
every
one
knew
where
mike
was
employed
every
one
knew
mysterious
unseen
and
swift
are
the
ways
of
communication
in
the
country
that
i
was
the
only
gentleman
at
present
residing
at
colonel
lawrence
ah
i
had
it
i
had
seen
in
one
of
the
a
small
pasteboard
box
shaped
like
a
doubtless
that
would
hold
it
i
found
the
box
it
was
of
just
the
size
i
needed
i
dropped
my
card
into
the
bottom
no
danger
of
a
lady
not
finding
the
card
accompanying
a
gift
of
flowers
neatly
fitted
the
bouquet
in
the
center
of
the
box
and
went
in
search
of
mike
he
winked
cheeringly
as
i
explained
the
nature
of
his
errand
and
he
whispered
i
do
it
as
clane
as
a
whistle
yer
honor
mistress
clarkson
cook
an
mesilf
understhand
each
other
an
i
used
to
goin
up
the
back
way
dhivil
a
man
can
see
but
the
angels
an
they
wo
tell
very
well
mike
here
a
dollar
for
you
you
find
the
box
on
the
in
the
hall
half
an
hour
later
while
i
sat
in
my
chamber
window
reading
i
beheld
mike
cleanly
shaved
dressed
and
brushed
swinging
up
the
road
with
my
box
balanced
on
one
of
his
enormous
hands
with
a
head
full
of
pleasing
fancies
i
went
down
to
supper
my
new
friends
were
unusually
good
their
ride
seemed
to
have
toned
down
their
boisterousness
and
elevated
their
little
souls
their
appetites
exhibited
no
diminution
of
force
but
they
talked
but
little
and
all
that
they
said
was
smart
funny
or
startling
so
much
so
that
when
after
supper
they
invited
me
to
put
them
to
bed
i
gladly
accepted
the
invitation
toddie
disappeared
somewhere
and
came
back
very
disconsolate
ca
find
my
dolly
he
whined
never
mind
old
pet
said
i
soothingly
uncle
will
ride
you
on
his
foot
but
i
want
my
dolly
said
he
piteously
rolling
out
his
lower
lip
i
remembered
my
experience
when
toddie
wanted
to
shee
wheels
go
wound
and
i
trembled
toddie
said
i
in
a
tone
so
persuasive
that
it
would
be
worth
thousands
a
year
to
me
as
a
salesman
if
i
could
only
command
it
at
will
toddie
do
you
want
to
ride
on
uncle
back
no
want
my
dolly
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
a
story
for
a
moment
toddie
face
indicated
a
terrible
internal
conflict
between
old
adam
and
mother
eve
but
curiosity
finally
overpowered
natural
depravity
and
toddie
murmured
yesh
what
shall
i
tell
you
about
nawndeark
about
what
he
means
noah
an
the
ark
exclaimed
budge
datsh
what
shay
nawndeark
declared
toddie
well
said
i
hastily
refreshing
my
memory
by
picking
up
the
bible
for
helen
like
most
people
is
pretty
sure
to
forget
to
pack
her
bible
when
she
runs
away
from
home
for
a
few
days
well
once
it
rained
forty
days
and
nights
and
everybody
was
drowned
from
the
face
of
the
earth
excepting
noah
a
righteous
man
who
was
saved
with
all
his
family
in
an
ark
which
the
lord
commanded
him
to
build
uncle
harry
said
budge
after
contemplating
me
with
open
eyes
and
mouth
for
at
least
two
minutes
after
i
had
finished
do
you
think
that
noah
certainly
budge
here
the
whole
story
in
the
bible
well
do
think
it
noah
one
single
bit
said
he
with
increasing
emphasis
i
beginning
to
think
we
read
different
bibles
budge
but
let
hear
your
version
huh
tell
me
about
noah
if
you
know
so
much
about
him
i
will
if
you
want
me
to
once
the
lord
felt
so
uncomfortable
cos
folks
was
bad
that
he
was
sorry
he
ever
made
anybody
or
any
world
or
anything
but
noah
was
bad
the
lord
liked
him
so
he
told
noah
to
build
a
big
ark
and
then
the
lord
would
make
it
rain
so
everybody
should
be
drownded
but
noah
an
his
little
boys
an
girls
an
doggies
an
pussies
an
an
an
hosses
an
everything
they
go
in
the
ark
would
get
wetted
a
bit
when
it
rained
an
noah
took
lots
of
things
to
eat
in
the
ark
cookies
an
milk
an
oatmeal
an
strawberries
an
porgies
an
oh
yes
an
an
but
noah
did
want
everybody
to
get
drownded
so
he
talked
to
folks
an
said
goin
to
rain
awful
pretty
soon
you
better
be
good
an
then
the
lord
let
you
come
into
my
ark
an
they
jus
said
if
it
rains
we
go
in
the
house
till
it
stops
an
other
folks
said
ai
afraid
of
rain
we
got
an
umbrella
an
some
more
said
they
was
goin
to
be
afraid
of
just
a
rain
but
it
did
rain
though
folks
went
in
their
houses
an
the
water
came
in
an
they
went
an
the
water
came
up
there
an
they
got
on
the
tops
of
the
houses
an
up
in
big
trees
an
up
in
mountains
an
the
water
went
after
everywhere
an
drownded
everybody
only
just
except
noah
and
the
people
in
the
ark
an
it
rained
forty
days
an
nights
an
then
it
stopped
an
noah
got
out
of
the
ark
an
he
and
his
little
boys
girls
went
wherever
they
wanted
to
and
everything
in
the
world
was
all
theirs
there
was
anybody
to
tell
to
go
home
nor
no
kindergarten
schools
to
go
to
nor
no
bad
boys
to
fight
nor
nothin
now
tell
us
story
i
determined
that
i
would
not
again
attempt
to
repeat
portions
of
the
scripture
narrative
my
experience
in
that
direction
had
not
been
encouraging
i
ventured
upon
a
war
story
do
you
know
what
the
war
was
i
asked
by
way
of
reconnoissance
oh
yes
said
budge
papa
was
there
an
he
got
a
sword
do
you
see
it
hangin
up
there
yes
i
saw
it
and
the
difference
between
the
terrible
field
where
last
i
saw
tom
sword
in
action
and
this
quiet
room
where
it
now
hung
forced
me
into
a
reverie
from
which
i
was
aroused
by
budge
remarking
ai
you
goin
to
tell
us
one
oh
yes
budge
one
day
while
the
war
was
going
on
there
was
a
whole
lot
of
soldiers
going
along
a
road
and
they
were
as
hungry
as
they
could
be
they
had
had
anything
to
eat
that
day
why
did
they
go
into
the
houses
and
the
people
they
was
hungry
that
what
do
when
i
goes
along
roads
because
the
people
in
that
country
did
like
them
the
brothers
and
papas
and
husbands
of
those
people
were
soldiers
too
but
they
like
the
soldiers
i
told
you
about
first
and
they
wanted
to
kill
them
i
do
think
they
were
a
bit
nice
said
budge
with
considerable
decision
well
the
first
soldiers
wanted
to
kill
them
budge
then
they
was
all
bad
to
want
to
kill
each
other
oh
no
they
were
there
were
a
great
many
real
good
men
on
both
sides
poor
budge
looked
sadly
puzzled
as
he
had
an
excellent
right
to
do
since
the
wisest
and
best
men
are
sorely
perplexed
by
the
nature
of
warlike
feeling
both
parties
of
soldiers
were
on
horseback
i
continued
and
they
were
near
each
other
and
when
they
saw
each
other
they
made
their
horses
run
fast
and
the
bugles
blew
and
the
soldiers
all
took
their
swords
out
to
kill
each
other
with
when
just
then
a
little
boy
who
had
been
out
in
the
woods
to
pick
berries
for
his
mama
tried
to
run
across
the
road
and
caught
his
toe
some
way
and
fell
down
and
cried
then
somebody
hallooed
very
loud
and
all
the
horses
on
one
side
stopped
and
then
somebody
else
hallooed
and
a
lot
of
bugles
blew
and
every
horse
on
the
other
side
stopped
and
one
soldier
jumped
off
his
horse
and
picked
up
the
little
boy
he
was
only
about
as
big
as
you
budge
and
tried
to
comfort
him
and
then
a
soldier
from
the
other
side
came
up
to
look
at
him
and
then
more
soldiers
came
from
both
sides
to
look
at
him
and
when
he
got
better
and
walked
home
the
soldiers
all
rode
away
because
they
did
feel
like
fighting
just
then
oh
uncle
harry
i
think
it
was
an
awful
good
soldier
that
got
off
his
horse
to
take
care
of
that
poor
little
boy
do
you
budge
who
do
you
think
it
was
i
dunno
it
was
your
papa
oh
h
h
h
h
if
tom
could
have
but
seen
the
expression
upon
his
boy
face
as
he
prolonged
this
exclamation
his
loss
of
one
of
the
grandest
chances
a
cavalry
officer
ever
had
would
not
have
seemed
so
great
to
him
as
it
had
done
for
years
he
seemed
to
take
in
the
story
in
all
its
bearings
and
his
great
eyes
grew
in
depth
as
they
took
on
the
look
which
seemed
too
earnest
for
the
strength
of
an
earthly
being
to
support
but
toddie
he
who
a
fond
mama
thought
endowed
with
art
sense
toddie
had
throughout
my
recital
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
musing
on
some
affair
of
his
own
and
budge
exclamation
had
hardly
died
away
when
toddie
commenced
to
wave
aloud
an
extravaganza

his

a
knock
at
the
door
interrupted
me
come
in
i
shouted
in
stepped
mike
with
an
air
of
the
greatest
secrecy
handed
me
a
letter
and
the
identical
box
in
which
i
had
sent
the
flowers
to
miss
mayton
what
could
it
mean
i
hastily
opened
the
envelope
and
at
the
same
time
toddie
shrieked
oh
darsh
my
dolly
dare
snatched
and
opened
the
box
and
displayed
his
doll
my
heart
sickened
and
did
not
regain
its
strength
during
the
perusal
of
the
following
note
miss
mayton
herewith
returns
to
burton
the
package
which
just
arrived
with
his
card
she
recognizes
the
contents
as
a
portion
of
the
apparent
property
of
one
of
burton
nephews
but
is
unable
to
understand
why
it
should
have
been
sent
to
her
june
toddie
i
roared
as
my
younger
nephew
caressed
his
loathsome
doll
and
murmured
endearing
words
to
it
where
did
you
get
that
box
on
the
replied
the
youth
with
perfect
fearlessness
i
keeps
it
in
ze
djawer
an
somebody
took
it
an
put
nasty
ole
flowers
in
it
where
are
those
flowers
i
demanded
toddie
looked
up
with
considerable
surprise
but
promptly
replied
i
froed
away
do
want
no
ole
flowers
in
my
dolly
that
ze
way
she
wocks
see
and
this
horrible
little
destroyer
of
human
hopes
rolled
that
box
back
and
forth
with
the
most
utter
unconcern
as
he
spoke
endearing
words
to
the
substitute
for
my
beautiful
bouquet
to
say
that
i
looked
at
toddie
reprovingly
is
to
express
my
feelings
in
the
most
inadequate
language
but
of
language
in
which
to
express
my
feelings
to
toddie
i
could
find
absolutely
none
within
two
or
three
short
moments
i
had
discovered
how
very
anxious
i
really
was
to
merit
miss
mayton
regard
and
how
very
different
was
the
regard
i
wanted
from
that
which
i
had
previously
hoped
might
be
accorded
me
it
seemed
too
ridiculous
to
be
true
that
i
who
had
for
years
had
dozens
of
charming
lady
acquaintances
and
yet
had
always
maintained
my
common
sense
and
i
who
had
always
considered
it
unmanly
for
a
man
to
specially
interest
himself
in
any
lady
until
he
had
an
income
of
five
thousand
a
year
i
who
had
skilfully
and
many
times
argued
that
or
attempts
thereat
which
were
made
without
a
careful
preliminary
study
of
the
mental
characteristics
of
the
partner
desired
was
the
most
unpardonable
folly
i
had
transgressed
every
one
of
my
own
rules
and
as
if
to
mock
me
for
any
pretended
wisdom
and
care
my
weakness
was
made
known
to
me
by
a
marplot
and
a
hideous
that
merciful
and
ennobling
dispensation
by
which
providence
enables
us
to
temper
the
severity
of
our
own
sufferings
by
alleviating
those
of
others
came
soon
to
my
rescue
under
my
stern
glance
toddie
gradually
lost
interest
in
his
doll
and
its
cradle
and
began
to
thrust
forth
and
outward
his
piteous
lower
lip
and
to
weep
copiously
dee
lord
not
make
me
sho
bad
he
cried
through
his
tears
i
doubt
his
having
had
any
very
clear
idea
of
what
he
was
saying
or
whom
he
was
addressing
but
had
the
publican
of
whose
prayer
toddie
made
so
fair
a
paraphrase
worn
such
a
face
when
he
offered
his
famous
petition
it
could
not
have
been
denied
for
a
moment
toddie
even
retired
to
a
corner
and
hid
his
face
in
penance
never
mind
toddie
said
i
sadly
you
did
mean
to
do
it
i
know
i
wantsh
to
love
you
sobbed
toddie
well
come
here
you
poor
little
fellow
said
i
opening
my
arms
and
wondering
whether
was
not
after
contemplation
of
some
such
sinner
that
good
bishop
tegner
wrote
depths
of
love
are
atonement
depths
for
love
is
atonement
toddie
came
to
my
arms
shed
tears
freely
upon
my
and
finally
after
heaving
a
very
long
sigh
remarked
wantsh
you
to
love
me
i
complied
with
his
request
theoretically
i
had
long
believed
that
the
higher
wisdom
of
the
creator
was
most
frequently
expressed
through
the
medium
of
his
most
innocent
creations
surely
here
was
a
confirmation
of
my
theory
for
who
else
had
ever
practically
taught
me
the
duty
of
the
injured
one
toward
his
offender
i
kissed
toddie
and
petted
him
and
at
length
succeeded
in
quieting
him
his
little
face
in
spite
of
much
dirt
and
many
was
upturned
with
more
of
beauty
in
it
than
it
ever
held
when
its
owner
was
full
of
joy
he
looked
earnestly
confidingly
into
my
eyes
and
i
congratulated
myself
upon
the
perfection
of
my
forgiving
spirit
when
toddie
suddenly
to
me
my
old
unregenerate
nature
and
the
incompleteness
of
my
forgiveness
by
saying
kish
my
dolly
too
i
obeyed
my
forgiveness
was
made
complete
but
so
was
my
humiliation
i
abruptly
closed
our
interview
we
exchanged
god
bless
you
according
to
budge
instructions
of
the
previous
night
and
at
least
one
of
the
participants
in
this
devotional
exercise
hoped
the
petitions
made
by
the
other
were
distinctly
heard
then
i
dropped
into
an
in
the
library
and
fell
to
thinking
i
found
myself
really
and
seriously
troubled
by
the
results
of
toddie
operation
with
my
bouquet
i
might
explain
the
matter
to
miss
mayton
i
undoubtedly
could
for
she
was
too
sensible
a
woman
to
be
easily
offended
merely
by
a
ridiculous
mistake
caused
by
a
child
but
she
would
laugh
at
me
how
could
she
help
it
and
to
be
laughed
at
by
miss
mayton
was
a
something
the
mere
thought
of
which
tormented
me
in
a
manner
that
made
me
fairly
ashamed
of
myself
like
every
other
young
man
among
young
men
i
had
been
the
butt
of
many
a
rough
joke
and
had
borne
them
without
wincing
it
seemed
cowardly
and
contemptible
that
i
should
be
so
sensitive
under
the
mere
thought
of
laughter
which
would
probably
be
heard
by
no
one
but
miss
mayton
herself
but
the
laughter
of
a
mere
acquaintance
is
likely
to
lessen
respect
for
the
person
laughed
at
heavens
the
thought
was
unendurable
at
any
rate
i
must
write
an
early
apology
when
i
was
correspondent
for
the
house
with
which
i
am
now
salesman
i
reclaimed
many
an
old
customer
who
had
wandered
off
certainly
i
might
hope
by
a
letter
to
regain
in
miss
mayton
respect
whatever
position
i
had
lost
i
hastily
drafted
a
letter
corrected
it
carefully
copied
it
in
due
form
and
forwarded
it
by
the
faithful
michael
then
i
tried
to
read
but
without
the
least
success
for
hours
i
paced
the
piazza
and
consumed
cigars
when
at
last
i
retired
it
was
with
many
ideas
hopes
fears
and
fancies
which
had
never
before
been
mine
true
to
my
trust
i
looked
into
my
nephews
room
there
lay
the
boys
in
postures
more
graceful
than
any
which
brush
or
chisel
have
ever
reproduced
toddie
in
particular
wore
so
lovely
an
expression
that
i
could
not
refrain
from
kissing
him
but
i
was
none
the
less
careful
to
make
use
of
my
new
key
and
to
lock
my
other
door
also
the
next
day
was
the
sabbath
believing
fully
in
the
binding
force
and
worldly
wisdom
of
the
fourth
commandment
so
far
as
it
refers
to
rest
i
have
conscientiously
trained
myself
to
sleep
two
hours
later
on
the
morning
of
the
holy
day
than
i
ever
allowed
myself
to
do
on
business
days
but
having
inherited
besides
a
new
england
conscience
a
new
england
abhorrence
of
waste
i
regularly
sit
up
two
hours
later
on
saturday
nights
than
on
any
others
and
the
night
preceding
this
particular
sabbath
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
as
the
reader
may
imagine
from
the
foregoing
recital
at
about
however
i
became
conscious
that
my
nephews
were
not
in
accord
with
me
on
the
sinaitic
law
they
were
not
only
awake
but
were
disputing
vigorously
and
seemingly
very
loudly
for
i
heard
their
words
very
distinctly
with
sleepy
condescension
i
endeavored
to
ignore
these
noisy
irreverents
but
i
was
suddenly
moved
to
a
belief
in
the
doctrine
of
vicarious
atonement
for
a
flying
body
with
more
momentum
than
weight
struck
me
upon
the
not
prominent
bridge
of
my
nose
and
speedily
and
with
unnecessary
force
accommodated
itself
to
the
outline
of
my
eyes
after
a
moment
spent
in
anguish
and
in
wondering
how
the
missive
came
through
closed
doors
and
windows
i
discovered
that
my
pain
had
been
caused
by
one
of
the
dolls
which
from
its
extreme
uncleanness
i
suspected
belonged
to
toddie
i
also
discovered
that
the
door
between
the
rooms
was
open
who
threw
that
doll
i
shouted
sternly
there
came
no
response
do
you
hear
i
roared
what
is
it
uncle
harry
asked
budge
with
most
exquisitely
polite
inflection
who
threw
that
doll
huh
i
say
who
threw
that
doll
why
nobody
did
it
toddie
who
threw
that
doll
budge
did
replied
toddie
in
muffled
tones
suggestive
of
a
brotherly
hand
laid
forcibly
over
a
pair
of
small
lips
budge
what
did
you
do
it
for
why
why
i
because
why
you
see
because
why
toddie
froo
his
dolly
in
my
mouth
some
of
her
hair
went
in
any
how
an
i
did
want
his
dolly
in
my
mouth
so
i
sent
it
back
to
him
an
the
foot
of
the
bed
did
stick
up
enough
so
it
went
from
the
door
to
your
bed
that
what
for
the
explanation
seemed
to
bear
marks
of
genuineness
albiet
the
pain
of
my
eye
was
not
alleviated
thereby
while
the
exertion
expended
in
eliciting
the
information
had
so
thoroughly
awakened
me
that
further
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
besides
the
open
door
had
a
burglar
been
in
the
room
no
my
watch
and
pocketbook
were
undisturbed
budge
who
opened
that
door
after
some
hesitation
as
if
wondering
who
really
did
it
budge
replied
me
how
did
you
do
it
why
you
see
we
wanted
a
drink
an
the
door
was
fast
so
we
got
out
the
window
on
the
parazzo
roof
an
comed
in
your
window
here
a
slight
pause
an
was
fun
an
then
we
unlocked
the
door
an
comed
back
then
i
should
be
compelled
to
lock
my
or
theirs
and
this
in
the
summer
season
too
oh
if
helen
could
have
but
passed
the
house
as
that
procession
had
filed
along
the
i
lay
pondering
over
the
vast
amount
of
unused
ingenuity
that
was
locked
up
in
millions
of
children
or
employed
only
to
work
misery
among
unsuspecting
adults
when
i
heard
light
footfalls
at
my
bedside
and
saw
a
small
shape
with
a
grave
face
approach
and
remark
i
wants
to
come
in
your
bed
what
for
toddie
to
fwolic
papa
always
fwolics
us
sunday
mornin
tum
budgie
ocken
hawwy
doin
to
fwolic
us
budge
replied
by
shrieking
with
delight
tumbling
out
of
bed
and
hurrying
to
that
side
of
my
bed
not
already
occupied
by
toddie
then
those
two
little
savages
sounded
the
onslaught
and
advanced
precipitately
upon
me
sometimes
during
the
course
of
my
life
i
have
had
which
i
have
told
to
no
one
among
these
has
been
one
not
now
so
distinct
as
it
was
before
my
four
years
of
campaigning
of
one
day
meeting
in
deadly
combat
the
painted
indian
of
the
plains
of
listening
undismayed
to
his
frightful
and
of
exemplifying
in
my
own
person
the
inevitable
result
of
the
superior
intelligence
but
upon
this
particular
sunday
morning
i
relinquished
this
idea
informally
but
forever
before
the
advance
of
these
diminutive
warriors
i
quailed
contemptibly
and
their
sent
more
terror
to
my
soul
than
that
member
ever
experienced
from
the
rebel
yell
according
to
toddie
i
was
going
to
fwolic
them
but
from
the
first
they
took
the
whole
business
into
their
own
little
but
effective
hands
toddie
pronounced
my
knees
collectively
bonnie
and
bestrode
them
laughing
gleefully
at
my
efforts
to
unseat
him
and
holding
himself
in
position
by
digging
his
pudgy
fingers
into
whatever
portions
of
my
anatomy
he
could
most
easily
seize
budge
shouted
i
want
a
horsie
too
and
seated
himself
upon
my
chest
this
is
the
way
the
horsie
goes
explained
he
as
he
slowly
rocked
himself
backward
and
forward
i
began
to
realize
how
my
who
had
once
been
a
fine
gymnast
had
become
so
just
then
budge
face
assumed
a
more
spirited
expression
his
eyes
opened
wide
and
lightened
up
and
shouting
this
the
way
the
horsie
trots
he
stood
upright
threw
up
his
feet
and
dropped
his
avoirdupois
pounds
forcibly
upon
my
lungs
he
repeated
this
operation
several
times
before
i
fully
recovered
from
the
shock
conveyed
by
his
combined
impudence
and
weight
but
pain
finally
brought
my
senses
back
and
with
a
wild
plunge
i
unseated
my
demoniac
riders
and
gained
a
clear
space
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
ah
h
h
h
h
h
h
screamed
toddie
i
wants
to
wide
horshie
backen
boo
oo
oo
oo
roared
budge
i
think
you
real
mean
i
love
you
at
all
regardless
alike
of
toddie
desires
of
budge
opinion
and
the
cessation
of
his
regard
i
performed
a
hasty
toilet
notnwithstanding
my
lost
rest
savagely
thanked
the
lord
for
sunday
at
church
at
least
i
could
be
free
from
my
tormentors
at
the
both
boys
invited
themselves
to
accompany
me
to
the
sanctuary
but
i
declined
without
thanks
to
take
them
might
be
to
assist
somewhat
in
teaching
them
one
of
the
best
of
habits
but
i
strongly
doubted
whether
the
severest
providence
would
consider
it
my
duty
to
endure
the
probable
consequences
of
such
an
attempt
besides
i
might
meet
miss
mayton
i
both
hoped
and
feared
i
might
and
i
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
appearing
before
her
with
the
causes
of
my
pleasant
remembrance
budge
protested
and
toddie
wept
but
i
remained
firm
although
i
was
so
willing
to
gratify
their
reasonable
desires
that
i
took
them
out
for
a
long
walk
while
enjoying
this
little
trip
i
delighted
the
children
by
killing
a
snake
and
spoiling
a
slender
cane
at
the
same
time
my
own
sole
consolation
coming
from
the
discovery
that
the
remains
of
the
staff
were
sufficient
to
make
a
cane
for
budge
while
returning
to
the
house
and
preparing
for
church
i
entered
into
a
solemn
agreement
with
budge
who
was
usually
recognized
as
the
head
of
this
fraternal
partnership
budge
contracted
for
himself
and
brother
to
make
no
attempts
to
enter
my
room
to
refrain
from
fighting
to
raise
loose
dirt
only
with
a
shovel
and
to
convey
it
to
its
destination
by
means
other
than
their
own
hats
and
aprons
to
pick
no
flowers
to
open
no
to
refer
all
disagreements
to
the
cook
as
arbitrator
and
to
build
no
houses
of
the
new
books
which
i
had
stacked
upon
the
library
table
in
consideration
of
the
promised
faithful
observance
of
these
conditions
i
agreed
that
budge
should
be
allowed
to
come
alone
to
sabbath
school
which
convened
directly
after
morning
service
he
to
start
only
after
maggie
had
pronounced
him
duly
cleansed
and
clothed
as
toddie
was
daily
kept
in
bed
from
eleven
to
one
i
felt
that
i
might
safely
worship
without
distracting
fears
for
budge
could
not
alone
and
in
a
single
hour
become
guilty
of
any
particular
sin
the
church
at
hillcrest
had
many
more
seats
than
members
and
as
but
few
summer
visitors
had
yet
appeared
in
the
town
i
was
conscious
of
being
industriously
stared
at
by
the
native
members
of
the
congregation
this
was
of
itself
discomfort
enough
but
not
all
to
which
i
was
destined
for
the
usher
conducted
me
quite
near
to
the
altar
and
showed
me
into
a
pew
whose
only
other
occupant
was
miss
mayton
of
course
the
lady
did
not
recognize
me
she
was
too
carefully
bred
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
in
church
and
i
spent
ten
uncomfortable
minutes
in
mentally
abusing
the
customs
of
good
society
the
beginning
of
the
service
partially
ended
my
uneasiness
for
i
had
no
the
pew
contained
none
so
miss
mayton
kindly
offered
me
a
share
in
her
own
and
yet
so
faultlessly
perfect
and
was
her
manner
that
i
wondered
whether
her
action
might
not
have
been
prompted
merely
by
a
sense
of
christian
duty
had
i
been
the
khan
of
tartary
she
could
not
have
been
more
polite
and
frigid
the
music
to
the
first
hymn
was
an
air
i
had
never
heard
before
so
i
stumbled
miserably
through
the
tenor
although
miss
mayton
rendered
the
soprano
without
a
single
false
note
the
sermon
was
longer
than
i
was
in
the
habit
of
listening
to
and
i
was
frequently
conscious
of
not
listening
at
all
as
for
my
position
and
appearance
neither
ever
seemed
so
insignificant
as
they
did
throughout
the
entire
service
the
minister
reached
and
finally
dear
brethren
with
my
earnest
prayers
for
a
successful
and
speedy
finale
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
congregation
sympathized
with
me
for
there
was
a
general
rustle
behind
me
as
these
words
were
spoken
it
soon
became
evident
however
that
the
hearers
were
moved
by
some
other
feeling
for
i
heard
a
profound
titter
or
two
behind
me
even
miss
mayton
turned
her
head
with
more
alacrity
than
was
consistent
with
that
grace
which
usually
characterized
her
motions
and
the
minister
himself
made
a
pause
of
unusual
length
i
turned
in
my
seat
and
saw
my
nephew
budge
dressed
in
his
best
his
head
irreverently
covered
and
his
new
cane
swinging
in
the
most
stylish
manner
he
paused
at
each
pew
carefully
surveyed
its
occupants
seemed
to
fail
in
finding
the
object
of
his
search
but
continued
his
efforts
in
spite
of
my
endeavors
to
catch
his
eye
finally
he
recognized
a
family
acquaintance
and
to
him
he
unburdened
his
bosom
by
remarking
in
tones
easily
heard
throughout
the
church
i
want
to
find
my
uncle
just
then
he
caught
my
eye
smiled
rapturously
hurried
to
me
and
laid
his
rascally
soft
cheek
confidingly
against
mine
while
an
audible
sensation
pervaded
the
church
what
to
do
or
say
to
him
i
scarcely
knew
but
my
quandary
was
turned
to
wonder
as
miss
mayton
her
face
full
of
mirth
but
her
eyes
full
of
tenderness
drew
the
little
scamp
close
to
her
and
mssed
him
soundly
at
the
same
instant
the
minister
not
without
some
little
hesitation
said
let
us
pray
i
hastily
bowed
my
head
glad
of
a
chance
to
hide
my
face
but
as
i
stole
a
glance
at
the
cause
of
this
irreligious
disturbance
i
caught
miss
mayton
eye
she
was
laughing
so
violently
that
the
contagion
was
unavoidable
and
i
laughed
all
the
harder
as
i
felt
that
one
mischievous
boy
had
undone
the
mischief
caused
by
another
after
the
benediction
budge
was
the
recipient
of
a
great
deal
of
attention
during
the
confusion
of
which
i
embraced
the
opportunity
to
say
to
miss
mayton
do
you
still
sustain
my
sister
in
her
opinion
of
my
nephews
miss
mayton
i
think
they
too
funny
for
anything
replied
the
lady
with
great
enthusiasm
i
do
wish
you
would
bring
them
to
call
upon
me
longing
to
see
an
original
young
gentleman
thank
you
said
i
and
i
have
toddie
bring
a
bouquet
by
way
of
atonement
do
she
replied
as
i
allowed
her
to
pass
from
the
pew
the
word
was
an
insignificant
one
but
it
made
me
happy
once
more
you
see
uncle
harry
exclaimed
budge
as
we
left
the
church
together
the
was
open
yet
an
i
wanted
to
hear
if
they
sing
again
in
church
so
i
came
in
an
you
was
in
seat
an
i
knew
you
was
somewhere
so
i
looked
for
you
bless
you
thought
i
snatching
him
into
my
arms
as
if
to
hurry
him
into
sabbath
school
but
really
to
give
him
a
kiss
of
grateful
affection
you
did
right
exactly
right
my
sunday
dinner
was
unexceptional
in
point
of
quantity
and
quality
and
a
bottle
of
my
claret
proved
to
be
most
excellent
yet
a
certain
uneasiness
of
mind
prevented
my
enjoying
the
meal
as
thoroughly
as
under
other
circumstances
i
might
have
done
my
uneasiness
came
of
a
mingled
sense
of
responsibility
and
ignorance
i
felt
that
it
was
the
proper
thing
for
me
to
see
that
my
nephews
spent
the
day
with
some
sense
of
the
requirements
and
duties
of
the
sabbath
but
how
i
was
to
bring
it
about
i
hardly
knew
the
boys
were
too
small
to
have
administered
to
them
and
they
were
too
lively
to
be
kept
quiet
by
any
ordinary
means
after
a
great
deal
of
thought
i
determined
to
consult
the
children
themselves
and
try
to
learn
what
their
parents
custom
had
been
budge
said
i
what
do
you
do
sundays
when
your
papa
and
mama
are
home

read
to
you

budge
with

zey

budge
budge

the
language

the
poet

i
rather
astonished
that
your
papa
has
taught
you
to
do
likewise

cried
budge
clapping

he

red
sea
an
the
water

up

bliaff
suggested
toddie
oh
no
tod
remonstrated
budge
joseph
coat
was
just
as
bloody
as
goliath
head
was
then
budge
turned
to
me
and
explained
that
all
tod
likes
goliath
for
is
when
his
head
was
cut
off
it
was
all
bloody
and
then
toddie
the
airy
sprite
whom
his
mother
described
as
being
irresistibly
drawn
to
whatever
was
beautiful
toddie
glared
upon
me
as
a
butcher
apprentice
might
stare
at
a
doomed
lamb
and
remarked
bliaff
head
was
all
bluggy
an
david
sword
was
all
bluggy
bluggy
as
everyfing
i
hastily
breathed
a
small
prayer
opened
the
bible
turned
to
the
story
of
joseph
and
audibly
condensed
it
as
i
read
joseph
was
a
good
little
boy
whose
papa
loved
him
very
dearly
but
his
brothers
did
like
him
and
they
sold
him
to
go
to
egypt
and
he
was
very
smart
and
told
the
people
what
their
dreams
meant
and
he
got
to
be
a
great
man
and
his
brothers
went
to
egypt
to
buy
corn
and
joseph
sold
them
some
and
then
he
let
them
know
who
he
was
and
he
sent
them
home
to
bring
their
papa
to
egypt
and
then
they
all
lived
there
together
that
ai
it
remarked
toddie
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
felt
himself
to
be
unjustly
treated
is
it
budge
oh
no
said
budge
you
did
read
it
good
a
bit
i
tell
you
how
it
is
once
there
was
a
little
boy
named
joseph
an
he
had
eleven
budders
they
was
awful
eleven
budders
an
his
papa
gave
him
a
new
coat
an
his
budders
had
nothin
but
their
old
jackets
to
wear
one
day
he
was
carryin
their
dinner
an
they
put
him
in
a
deep
dark
hole
but
they
did
put
his
nice
new
coat
in
they
killed
a
kid
an
dipped
the
coat
just
think
of
doin
that
to
a
nice
new
coat
they
dipped
it
in
the
kid
blood
an
made
it
all
bloody
all
bluggy
echoed
toddie
with
ferocious
emphasis
budge
continued
but
there
were
some
ishmalites
comin
along
that
way
and
the
awful
eleven
budders
took
him
out
of
the
deep
dark
hole
an
sold
him
to
the
ishmalites
an
they
sold
him
away
down
in
egypt
an
his
poor
old
papa
cried
an
cried
he
thought
a
big
lion
ate
joseph
up
but
he
was
ate
up
a
bit
but
there
was
no
nor
footnote
railway
cars
nor
stages
in
egypt
an
there
was
any
telegraphs
so
joseph
could
let
his
papa
know
where
he
was
an
he
got
so
smart
an
so
good
that
the
king
of
egypt
let
him
sell
all
the
corn
an
take
care
of
the
money
an
one
day
some
men
came
to
buy
some
corn
an
joseph
looked
at
an
there
they
was
his
own
budders
he
scared
like
everything
i
have
slapped
all
if
i
been
joseph
but
he
just
scared
an
then
he
let
know
who
he
was
an
he
kissed
an
he
did
whip
or
make
go
without
their
breakfast
or
stand
in
a
corner
nor
none
of
them
things
an
then
he
sent
back
for
their
papa
an
when
he
saw
his
papa
comin
he
ran
like
everything
and
gave
him
a
great
big
hug
and
a
kiss
joseph
was
too
big
to
ask
his
papa
if
he
brought
him
any
candy
but
he
was
awful
glad
to
see
him
an
the
king
gave
joseph
papa
a
nice
farm
an
they
all
had
real
good
times
after
that
and
they
dipped
the
coat
in
the
blood
an
made
it
all
bluggy
reiterated
toddie
uncle
harry
said
budge
what
do
you
think
my
papa
would
do
if
he
thought
i
was
all
ate
up
by
a
lion

bliaff

off
an
made
it
all
bluggy
an
bliaff
runned
away
this
short
narration
was
accompanied
by
more
spirited
and
unexpected
gestures
than
gough
ever
puts
into
a
long
lecture
i
do
like
goliath
at
all
remarked
budge
i
like
to
hear
ferus
who
ferus
do
you
know
never
heard
of
him
budge
why
y
y
exclaimed
budge
did
you
have
no
papa
when
you
was
a
little
boy
yes
but
he
never
told
me
about
any
one
named
ferus
there
no
such
person
named
in
anthon
classical
dictionary
either
what
sort
of
a
man
was
he
why
once
there
was
a
man
an
his
name
was
ferus
offerus
an
he
went
about
fightin
for
kings
but
when
any
king
got
afraid
of
anybody
he
would
fight
for
him
no
more
an
one
day
he
could
find
no
kings
that
was
afraid
of
nobody
an
the
people
told
him
the
lord
was
the
biggest
king
in
the
world
an
he
was
afraid
of
nobody
or
nothing
an
he
asked
where
he
could
find
the
lord
and
they
said
he
was
way
up
in
heaven
so
nobody
could
see
him
but
the
angels
but
he
liked
folks
to
work
for
him
instead
of
fight
so
ferus
wanted
to
know
what
kind
of
work
he
could
do
an
the
people
said
there
was
a
river
not
far
off
where
there
was
no
cos
the
water
run
so
fast
an
they
guessed
if
he
carry
folks
across
the
lord
would
like
it
so
ferus
went
there
and
he
cut
him
a
good
strong
cane
whenever
anybody
wanted
to
go
across
the
river
he
carry
on
his
back
one
night
he
was
sittin

he

window
but
he
could
see

so
he
sat
down
again
then
somebody
called
again
and
he
opened
the
door
again
an
there
was
a
little
bit
of
a
boy
as
big
as
toddie
ferus

and
ferus
walked
into
the
water

when

people
when
they
dead
budge
himself
had
the
face
of
a
rapt
saint
as
he
told
this
story
but
my
contemplation
of
his
countenance
was
suddenly
arrested
by
toddie
who
disapproving
of
the
unexciting
nature
of
his
brother
recital
had
strayed
into
the
garden
investigated
a
hornet
nest
been
stung
and
set
up
a
piercing
shriek
he
ran
in
to
me
and
as
i
hastily
picked
him
up
he
sobbed
want
to
be
wocked
footnote
rocked
want
one
boy
day
i
rocked
him
violently
and
petted
him
tenderly
but
again
he
sobbed
want
one
boy
day
what
does
the
child
mean
i
exclaimed
he
wants
you
to
sing
to
him
about
boy
one
day
said
budge
he
always
wants
mamma
to
sing
that
when
he
hurt
an
then
he
stops
crying
i
do
know
it
said
i
wo
jordan
do
toddie
i
tell
you
how
it
goes
said
budge
and
forthwith
the
youth
sang
the
following
song
a
line
at
a
time
i
following
him
in
words
and
air
where
is
my
little
bastik
footnote
basket
gone
said
charley
one
boy
day
i
guess
some
little
boy
or
girl
has
taken
it
away
an
kittie
too
where
ish
she
gone
oh
dear
what
shall
i
do
i
wish
i
could
my
bastik
find
an
little
kittie
too
i
go
to

an
look
perhaps
she
may
be
there
for
kittie
likes
to
take
a
nap
in
mamma
easy
chair
o
mamma
mamma
come
an
look
see
what
a
little
heap
here
kittie
in
the
bastik
here
all
cuddled
down
to
sleep
where
the
applicability
of
this
poem
to
my
nephew
peculiar
trouble
appeared
i
could
not
see
but
as
i
finished
it
his
sobs
gave
place
to
a
sigh
of
relief
toddie
said
i
do
you
love
your
uncle
harry
esh
i
do
love
you
then
tell
me
how
that
ridiculous
song
comforts
you
makes
me
feel
good
an
all
nicey
replied
toddie
would
you
feel
just
as
good
if
i
sang
in
a
gulf
of
dark
despair
no
do
like
dokdishpairs
if
a
dokdishpair
done
anyfing
to
me
knock
it
right
down
dead
with
this
extremely
lucid
remark
our
conversation
on
this
particular
subject
ended
but
i
wondered
during
a
few
uneasy
moments
whether
the
temporary
mental
aberration
which
had
once
afflicted
grandfather
and
mine
was
not
reappearing
in
this
his
youngest
descendant
my
wondering
was
cut
short
by
budge
who
remarked
in
a
confident
tone
now
uncle
harry
we
have
the
whistles
i
guess
i
acted
upon
the
suggestion
and
led
the
way
to
the
woods
i
had
not
had
occasion
to
seek
a
hickory
sapling
before
for
years
not
since
the
war
in
fact
when
i
learned
how
hot
a
fire
small
hickory
sticks
would
make
i
had
not
sought
wood
for
whistles
since
gracious
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
the
dissimilar
associations
called
up
by
these
recollections
threatened
to
put
me
in
a
frame
of
mind
which
might
have
resulted
in
a
bad
poem
had
not
my
nephews
kept
up
a
lively
succession
of
questions
such
as
no
one
but
children
can
ask
the
whistles
completed
i
was
marched
with
music
to
the
place
where
the
jacks
grew
it
was
just
such
a
place
as
boys
instinctively
delight
in
low
damp
and
boggy
with
a
brook
hiding
treacherously
away
under
overhanging
ferns
and
grasses
the
children
knew
by
sight
the
plant
which
bore
the
jacks
and
every
discovery
was
announced
by
a
piercing
shriek
of
delight
at
first
i
looked
hurriedly
toward
the
brook
as
each
yell
clove
the
air
but
as
i
became
accustomed
to
it
my
attention
was
diverted
by
some
exquisite
ferns
suddenly
however
a
succession
of
shrieks
announced
that
something
was
wrong
and
across
a
large
fern
i
saw
a
small
face
in
a
great
deal
of
agony
budge
was
hurrying
to
the
relief
of
his
brother
and
was
soon
as
deeply
imbedded
as
toddie
was
in
the
rich
black
mud
at
the
bottom
of
the
brook
i
dashed
to
the
rescue
stood
astride
the
brook
and
offered
a
hand
to
each
boy
when
a
treacherous
tuft
of
grass
gave
way
and
with
a
glorious
splash
i
went
in
myself
this
accident
turned
toddie
sorrow
to
laughter
but
i
ca
say
i
made
light
of
my
misfortune
on
that
account
to
fall
into
clean
water
is
not
pleasant
even
when
one
is
but
to
be
clad
in
white
pants
and
suddenly
drop
nearly
in
the
lap
of
mother
earth
is
quite
a
different
thing
i
hastily
picked
up
the
children
and
threw
them
upon
the
bank
and
then
wrathfully
strode
out
myself
and
tried
to
shake
myself
as
i
have
seen
a
newfoundland
dog
do
the
shake
was
not
a
success
it
caused
my
to
flap
dismally
about
my
ankles
and
sent
the
streams
of
loathsome
ooze
trickling
down
into
my
shoes
my
hat
of
drab
felt
had
fallen
off
by
the
brookside
and
been
plentifully
spattered
as
i
got
out
i
looked
at
my
youngest
nephew
with
speechless
indignation
uncle
harry
said
budge
was
real
good
of
the
lord
to
let
you
be
with
us
else
toddie
might
have
been
drownded
yes
said
i
and
i
should
have
much
ocken
hawwy
cried
toddie
running
impetuously
toward
me
pulling
me
down
and
patting
my
cheek
with
his
muddy
black
hand
i
loves
you
for
takin
me
out
de
water
i
accept
your
apology
said
i
but
let
hurry
home
there
was
but
one
residence
to
pass
and
that
thank
fortune
was
so
densely
screened
by
shrubbery
that
the
inmates
could
not
see
the
road
to
be
sure
we
were
on
a
favorite
driving
road
but
we
could
reach
home
in
five
minutes
and
we
might
dodge
into
the
woods
if
we
heard
a
carriage
coming
ha
there
came
a
carriage
already
and
we
was
there
ever
a
group
there
were
ladies
in
the
carriage
too
could
it
be
of
course
it
was
did
the
evil
spirit
which
guided
those
children
always
send
an
attendant
for
miss
mayton
before
he
began
operations
there
she
was
anyway
cool
neat
dainty
trying
to
look
collected
but
severely
flushed
by
the
attempt
it
was
of
no
use
to
drop
my
eyes
for
she
had
already
recognized
me
so
i
turned
to
her
a
face
which
i
think
must
have
been
just
the
one
unless
more
defiant
that
i
carried
into
two
or
three
cavalry
charges
you
seem
to
have
been
having
a
real
good
time
together
said
she
with
a
conventional
smile
as
the
carriage
passed
remember
all
going
to
call
on
me
tomorrow
afternoon
bless
the
girl
her
heart
was
as
quick
as
her
eyes
almost
any
other
young
lady
would
have
devoted
her
entire
energy
to
laughing
on
such
an
occasion
but
she
took
her
earliest
opportunity
to
make
me
feel
at
ease
such
a
royal
hearted
woman
deserves
to
i
caught
myself
just
here
with
my
cheeks
growing
quite
hot
under
the
mud
toddie
had
put
on
them
and
i
led
our
retreat
with
a
more
stylish
carriage
than
my
appearance
could
possibly
have
warranted
and
then
i
consigned
my
nephews
to
the
maid
with
very
much
the
air
of
an
officer
turning
over
a
large
number
of
prisoners
he
had
captured
i
hastily
changed
my
soiled
clothing
for
my
best
not
that
i
expected
to
see
any
one
but
because
of
a
sudden
increase
in
the
degree
of
respect
i
felt
toward
myself
when
the
children
were
put
to
bed
and
i
had
no
one
but
my
thoughts
for
companions
i
spent
a
delightful
hour
or
two
in
imagining
as
possible
some
changes
of
which
i
had
never
dared
to
think
before
on
monday
morning
i
was
in
the
garden
at
sunrise
toddie
was
to
carry
his
expiatory
bouquet
to
miss
mayton
that
day
and
i
proposed
that
no
pains
should
be
spared
to
make
his
atonement
as
handsome
as
possible
i
canvassed
carefully
every
border
bed
and
detached
flowering
plant
until
i
had
as
accurate
an
idea
of
their
possibilities
as
if
i
had
inventoried
the
flowers
in
pen
and
ink
this
done
i
consulted
the
servant
as
to
the
unsoiled
clothing
of
my
nephews
she
laid
out
their
entire
wardrobe
for
my
inspection
and
after
a
rigid
examination
of
everything
i
selected
the
suits
which
the
boys
were
to
wear
in
the
afternoon
then
i
told
the
girl
that
the
boys
were
going
with
me
after
dinner
to
call
on
some
ladies
and
that
i
desired
that
she
should
wash
and
dress
them
carefully
tell
me
just
what
time
you
start
sir
and
i
begin
an
hour
beforehand
said
she
that
the
only
way
to
be
sure
that
they
disgrace
you
for
breakfast
we
had
among
other
things
some
stewed
oysters
served
in
o
todd
shrieked
budge
there
the
again
oh
ai
i
glad
oo
ee
turtle
pyates
squealed
toddie
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
boys
i
demanded
i
show
you
said
budge
jumping
down
from
his
chair
and
bringing
his
plate
of
oysters
cautiously
toward
me
now
you
just
put
your
head
down
underneath
my
plate
and
look
up
and
you
see
a
turtle
for
a
moment
i
forgot
that
i
was
not
at
a
restaurant
and
i
took
the
plate
held
it
up
and
examined
its
bottom
there
said
budge
pointing
to
the
trademark
in
colors
of
the
makers
of
the
crockery
do
you
see
the
turtle
i
abruptly
ordered
budge
to
his
seat
unmoved
even
by
toddie
remark
that
dey
ish
turtles
but
dey
ca
knawl
awound
like
udder
turtles
after
breakfast
i
devoted
a
great
deal
of
fussy
attention
to
myself
never
did
my
own
wardrobe
seem
so
meager
and
never
did
i
cut
myself
so
many
times
while
shaving
never
did
i
use
such
unsatisfactory
i
finally
gave
up
in
despair
my
effort
to
appear
genteel
and
devoted
myself
to
the
bouquet
i
cut
almost
flowers
enough
to
dress
a
church
and
then
remorselessly
excluded
every
one
which
was
in
the
least
particular
imperfect
in
making
the
bouquet
i
enjoyed
the
benefit
of
my
nephews
assistance
and
counsel
and
took
enforced
part
in
conversation
which
flowers
suggested
ocken
hawwy
said
toddie
ish
heaven
all
like
this
wif
pretty
cos
i
do
see
what
ze
angels
ever
turns
out
for
if
is
uncle
harry
said
budge
when
the
leaves
all
go
up
and
down
and
wriggle
around
so
are
they
talking
to
the
wind
i
i
guess
so
old
fellow
who
are
you
making
that
bouquet
for
uncle
harry
asked
budge
for
a
lady
for
miss
mayton
that
lady
that
saw
us
all
muddy
yesterday
afternoon
said
i
oh
i
like
her
said
budge
she
looks
so
nice
and
pretty
just
like
a
cake
just
as
if
she
was
good
to
eat
oh
i
just
love
her
do
you
well
i
respect
her
very
highly
budge
what
does
mean
why
it
means
that
i
think
she
a
lady
a
real
pleasant
the
nicest
sort
of
lady
in
the
world
the
sort
of
person
i
like
to
see
every
day
and
like
to
see
her
better
than
any
one
else
oh
why
an
love
means
just
the
same
thing
do
they
uncle
har
budge
i
exclaimed
somewhat
hastily
run
ask
maggie
for
a
piece
of
string
quick
all
right
said
budge
moving
off
but
they
do
do
they
at
two
i
instructed
maggie
to
dress
my
nephews
and
at
three
we
started
to
make
our
call
to
carry
toddie
bouquet
and
hold
a
hand
of
each
boy
so
as
to
keep
them
from
darting
into
the
hedges
for
grasshoppers
and
the
gutters
for
butterflies
was
no
easy
work
but
i
managed
to
do
it
as
we
approached
clarkson
i
felt
my
hat
was
over
one
ear
and
my
cravat
awry
but
there
was
no
opportunity
to
rearrange
them
for
i
saw
alice
mayton
on
the
piazza
and
felt
that
she
saw
me
handing
the
bouquet
to
toddie
and
promising
him
three
sticks
of
candy
if
he
would
be
careful
and
not
drop
it
we
entered
the
garden
the
moment
we
were
inside
the
hedge
and
toddie
saw
a
man
going
over
the
lawn
with
a
he
shrieked
oh
deresh
a
and
dropped
the
bouquet
with
the
carelessness
born
of
perfect
ecstasy
i
snatched
it
before
it
reached
the
ground
dragged
the
offending
youth
up
the
walk
saluted
miss
mayton
and
told
toddie
to
give
the
bouquet
to
the
lady
this
he
succeeded
in
doing
but
as
miss
mayton
thanked
him
and
stooped
to
kiss
him
he
wriggled
off
the
piazza
like
a
little
eel
shouted
tum
on
to
his
brother
and
a
moment
later
my
nephews
were
following
the
at
a
respectful
distance
in
the
rear
those
are
my
sister
best
children
in
the
world
miss
mayton
said
i
bless
the
little
darlings
replied
the
lady
i
do
love
to
see
children
enjoying
themselves
so
do
i
said
i
when
i
not
responsible
for
their
but
if
the
effort
i
expended
on
those
boys
had
been
directed
toward
the
interests
of
my
employers
those
worthy
gentlemen
would
consider
me
invaluable
miss
mayton
made
some
witty
reply
and
we
settled
to
a
pleasant
chat
about
mutual
acquaintances
about
books
pictures
music
and
the
gossip
of
our
set
i
would
cheerfully
have
discussed
herbert
system
the
assyrian
tablets
or
any
other
dry
subject
with
miss
mayton
and
felt
that
i
was
richly
repaid
by
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
handsome
intelligent
composed
tastefully
dressed
without
a
suspicion
of
the
flirt
or
the
languid
woman
of
fashion
about
her
she
awakened
to
the
uttermost
every
admiring
sentiment
and
every
manly
feeling
but
alas
my
enjoyment
was
probably
more
than
i
deserved
so
it
was
cut
short
there
were
other
ladies
boarding
at
clarkson
and
as
miss
mayton
truthfully
observed
at
our
first
meeting
men
were
very
scarce
at
hillcrest
so
the
ladies
by
the
merest
accident
of
course
happened
upon
the
piazza
and
each
one
was
presented
to
me
and
common
civility
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
speak
to
miss
mayton
more
than
once
in
ten
minutes
at
any
other
time
and
place
i
should
have
found
the
meeting
of
so
many
ladies
a
delightful
experience
but
now
suddenly
a
compound
shriek
arose
from
the
lawn
and
all
the
ladies
sprang
to
their
feet
i
followed
their
example
setting
my
teeth
firmly
and
viciously
hoping
that
whichever
nephew
had
been
hurt
was
badly
hurt
we
saw
toddie
running
towards
us
with
one
hand
in
his
mouth
while
budge
ran
beside
him
exclaiming
poor
little
toddie
do
cry
does
it
hurt
you
awful
never
mind
uncle
harry
comfort
you
do
cry
toddie
both
boys
reached
the
piazza
steps
and
clambered
up
budge
exclaiming
o
uncle
harry
toddie
put
his
fingers
in
the
little
wheels
of
the
an
it
turned
just
the
least
little
biddie
an
it
hurted
him
but
toddie
ran
up
to
me
clasped
my
legs
and
sobbed
sing
one
boy
day
my
blood
seemed
to
freeze
i
could
have
choked
that
dreadful
child
suffering
though
he
was
i
stooped
over
him
caressed
him
promised
him
candy
took
out
my
watch
and
gave
it
to
him
to
play
with
but
he
returned
to
his
original
demand
a
lady
the
homeliest
in
the
party
suggested
that
she
should
bind
up
his
hand
and
i
inwardly
blessed
her
but
he
reiterated
his
request
for
toddie
one
boy
day
and
sobbed
pitifully
what
does
he
mean
asked
miss
mayton
he
wants
uncle
harry
to
sing
boy
one
day
explained
budge
he
always
wants
that
song
when
he
hurt
any
way
oh
do
sing
it
to
him
burton
pleaded
miss
mayton
and
all
the
other
ladies
exclaimed
oh
do
i
wrathfully
picked
him
up
in
my
arms
and
hummed
the
air
of
the
detested
song
sit
in
a
sobbed
toddie
i
obeyed
and
then
my
tormentor
remarked
you
do
sing
the
wydes
words
i
wants
the
wydes
i
sang
the
words
as
softly
as
possible
with
my
lips
close
to
his
ear
but
he
roared
sing
louder
i
do
know
any
more
of
it
toddie
i
exclaimed
in
desperation
oh
i
tell
it
all
to
you
uncle
harry
said
budge
and
there
before
that
audience
and
her
i
was
obliged
to
sing
that
dreadful
doggerel
line
for
line
as
budge
repeated
it
my
teeth
were
set
tight
my
brow
grew
clammy
and
i
gazed
upon
toddie
with
terrible
thoughts
in
my
mind
no
one
laughed
i
grew
so
desperate
that
a
titter
would
have
given
relief
at
last
i
heard
some
one
whisper
see
how
he
loves
him
poor
man
he
in
perfect
agony
over
the
little
fellow
had
not
the
song
reached
its
natural
end
just
then
i
believe
i
should
have
tossed
my
wounded
nephew
over
the
piazza
rail
as
it
was
i
set
him
upon
his
feet
announced
the
necessity
of
our
departure
and
began
to
take
leave
when
miss
mayton
mother
insisted
that
we
should
stay
to
dinner
for
myself
i
should
be
delighted
mayton
said
i
but
my
nephews
have
hardly
learned
company
manners
yet
i
afraid
my
sister
would
forgive
me
if
she
heard
i
had
taken
them
out
to
dinner
oh
i
take
care
of
the
little
dears
said
miss
mayton
they
be
good
with
me
i
know
i
could
be
so
unkind
as
to
let
you
try
it
miss
mayton
i
replied
but
she
insisted
and
the
pleasure
of
submitting
to
her
will
was
so
great
that
i
would
have
risked
even
greater
mischief
so
miss
mayton
sat
down
to
dinner
with
budge
upon
one
side
and
toddie
on
the
other
while
i
was
fortunately
placed
opposite
from
which
position
i
could
indulge
in
warning
winks
and
frowns
the
soup
was
served
i
signaled
the
boys
to
tuck
their
napkins
under
their
chins
and
then
turned
to
speak
to
the
lady
on
my
right
she
politely
inclined
her
head
toward
me
but
her
thoughts
seemed
elsewhere
following
her
eyes
i
beheld
my
youngest
nephew
with
his
plate
upraised
in
both
hands
his
head
on
the
and
his
eyes
turned
painfully
upward
i
dared
not
speak
for
fear
he
would
drop
the
plate
suddenly
he
withdrew
his
head
put
on
an
angelic
smile
tilted
his
plate
so
part
of
its
contents
sought
refuge
in
the
fold
of
miss
mayton
dainty
snowy
dress
while
the
offender
screamed
oo
ee
zha
turtle
on
my
pyate
budgie
zha
turtle
on
my
pyate
budge
was
about
to
raise
the
plate
when
he
caught
my
eye
and
desisted
poor
miss
mayton
actually
looked
discomposed
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
so
far
as
i
knew
or
could
imagine
she
recovered
quickly
however
and
treated
that
wretched
boy
with
the
most
christian
forbearance
and
consideration
during
the
remainder
of
the
meal
when
the
dessert
was
finished
she
quickly
excused
herself
while
i
removed
toddie
to
a
secluded
corner
of
the
piazza
and
favored
him
with
a
lecture
which
caused
him
to
howl
pitifully
and
compelled
me
to
caress
him
and
undo
all
the
good
which
my
rebukes
had
done
then
he
and
budge
removed
themselves
to
the
lawn
while
i
awaited
miss
reappearance
to
offer
an
apology
for
toddie
and
to
make
our
adieus
it
was
the
custom
of
the
ladies
at
clarkson
to
stroll
about
the
lovely
rural
walks
after
dinner
and
until
twilight
and
on
this
particular
evening
they
departed
in
twos
and
threes
leaving
me
to
make
my
apology
without
witnesses
i
was
rather
sorry
they
went
it
was
not
pleasant
to
feel
that
i
was
principally
responsible
for
my
blunder
and
to
have
no
opportunity
to
allay
my
by
conversation
it
seemed
to
me
miss
mayton
was
forever
in
appearing
i
even
called
up
my
nephews
to
have
some
one
to
talk
to
suddenly
she
appeared
and
in
an
instant
i
fervently
blessed
toddie
and
the
soup
which
the
child
had
sent
upon
its
aimless
wanderings
i
would
rather
pay
the
price
of
a
fine
dress
than
try
to
describe
miss
attire
i
can
only
say
that
in
style
color
and
ornament
it
became
her
perfectly
and
set
off
the
beauties
of
a
face
which
i
had
never
before
thought
was
more
than
pleasing
and
intelligent
perhaps
the
anger
which
was
excusable
after
toddie
graceless
caper
had
something
to
do
with
putting
unusual
color
into
her
cheeks
and
a
brighter
sparkle
than
usual
in
her
eyes
whatever
was
the
cause
she
looked
queenly
and
i
half
imagined
that
i
detected
in
her
face
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
at
the
involuntary
start
which
her
unexpected
appearance
caused
me
to
make
she
accepted
my
apology
for
toddie
with
queenly
graciousness
and
then
instead
of
proposing
that
we
should
follow
the
other
ladies
as
a
moment
before
i
had
hoped
she
would
she
dropped
into
a
chair
i
accepted
the
invitation
the
children
should
have
been
in
bed
half
an
hour
before
but
my
sense
of
responsibility
had
departed
when
miss
mayton
appeared
the
little
scamps
were
safe
until
they
should
perform
some
new
and
unexpected
act
of
impishness
they
retired
to
one
end
of
the
piazza
and
busied
themselves
in
experiments
upon
a
large
newfoundland
dog
while
i
the
happiest
man
alive
talked
to
the
glorious
woman
before
me
and
enjoyed
the
spectacle
of
her
radiant
beauty
the
twilight
came
and
deepened
but
imagination
prevented
the
vision
from
fading
with
the
coming
of
the
darkness
and
the
starlight
our
voices
unconsciously
dropped
to
lower
tones
and
her
voice
seemed
purest
music
and
yet
we
said
nothing
which
all
the
world
might
not
have
listened
to
without
suspecting
a
secret
the
ladies
returned
in
little
groups
but
either
out
of
womanly
intuition
or
in
answer
to
my
unspoken
but
fervent
prayers
passed
us
and
went
into
the
house
i
was
affected
by
an
odd
mixture
of
desperate
courage
and
despicable
cowardice
i
determined
to
tell
her
all
yet
i
shrank
from
the
task
with
more
terror
than
ever
befell
me
in
the
first
steps
of
a
charge
suddenly
a
small
shadow
came
from
behind
us
and
stood
between
us
and
the
voice
of
budge
remarked
uncle
harry
you
miss
mayton
suspects
me
of
what
pray
exclaimed
the
lady
patting
my
cheek
budge
said
i
i
feel
that
my
voice
rose
nearly
to
a
scream
budge
i
must
beg
of
you
to
respect
the
sanctity
of
confidential
communications
what
is
it
budge
persisted
miss
mayton
you
know
the
old
adage
burton
and
fools
speak
the
truth
of
what
does
he
suspect
me
budge
at
all
said
budge
it
expect
echoed
miss
mayton
no
not
it
i
know
all
about
it
i
asked
him
espect
is
what
folks
do
when
they
think
you
nice
and
like
to
talk
to
you
and
respect
is
what
the
boy
is
trying
to
say
miss
mayton
i
interrupted
to
prevent
what
i
feared
might
follow
budge
has
a
terrifying
faculty
for
asking
questions
and
the
result
of
some
of
them
this
morning
was
my
endeavor
to
explain
to
him
the
nature
of
the
respect
in
which
gentlemen
hold
ladies
yes
continued
budge
i
know
all
about
it
only
uncle
harry
say
it
right
what
he
calls
espect
calls
love
there
was
an
awkward
pause
it
seemed
an
age
another
blunder
and
all
on
account
of
those
dreadful
children
i
could
think
of
no
possible
way
to
turn
the
conversation
stranger
yet
miss
mayton
could
not
do
so
either
something
must
be
done
i
could
at
least
be
honest
come
what
would
i
would
be
honest
miss
mayton
said
i
hastily
earnestly
but
in
a
very
low
tone
budge
is
a
marplot
but
he
is
a
truthful
interpreter
for
all
that
but
whatever
my
fate
may
be
please
do
not
suspect
me
of
falling
suddenly
into
love
for
a
holiday
diversion
my
malady
is
of
some
standing
i
i
want
to
talk
some
observed
budge
you
talk
all
the
whole
time
i
i
when
loves
anybody
i
kisses
them
miss
mayton
gave
a
little
start
and
my
thoughts
followed
each
other
with
unimagined
rapidity
she
did
not
turn
the
conversation
it
could
not
be
possible
that
she
could
not
she
was
not
angry
or
she
would
have
expressed
herself
could
it
be
that
i
bent
over
her
and
acted
upon
budge
suggestion
as
she
displayed
no
resentment
i
pressed
my
lips
a
second
time
to
her
forehead
then
she
raised
her
head
slightly
and
i
saw
in
spite
of
darkness
and
shadows
that
alice
mayton
had
surrendered
at
discretion
taking
her
hand
and
straightening
myself
to
my
full
height
i
offered
to
the
lord
mere
fervent
thanks
than
he
ever
heard
from
me
in
church
then
i
heard
budge
say
wants
to
kiss
you
too
and
i
saw
my
glorious
alice
snatch
the
little
scamp
into
her
arms
and
treat
him
with
more
affection
than
i
ever
imagined
was
in
her
nature
then
she
seized
toddie
and
gave
him
a
few
tokens
of
forgiveness
i
dare
not
think
they
were
of
gratitude
suddenly
two
or
three
ladies
came
upon
the
piazza
come
boys
said
i
then
i
call
with
the
carriage
tomorrow
at
three
miss
mayton

replied
the
sweetest
voice
in
the
world

toddie
what

nuffin
else
do
want
to
be
boddered
wif
lots
of
fings
the
thoughts
which
were
mine
that
night
the
sense
of
how
glorious
a
thing
it
is
to
be
a
man
and
be
loved
the
humility
that
comes
with
such
a
victory
as
i
had
gained
the
rapid
alternation
of
happy
thoughts
and
noble
resolutions
what
man
is
there
who
does
not
know
my
whole
story
better
than
i
can
tell
it
i
put
my
nephews
to
bed
i
told
them
every
story
they
asked
for
and
when
budge
in
saying
his
prayers
said
bless
that
nice
lady
that
uncle
harry
i
interrupted
his
devotions
with
a
hearty
hug
the
children
had
been
awake
so
far
beyond
their
usual
hour
for
retiring
that
they
dropped
asleep
without
giving
any
special
notice
of
their
intention
to
do
so
asleep
their
faces
were
simply
angelic
as
i
stood
candle
in
hand
gazing
gratefully
upon
them
i
remembered
a
sadly
neglected
duty
i
hurried
to
the
library
and
wrote
the
following
to
my
sister
hillcrest
monday
night
dear
helen
i
should
have
written
you
before
had
i
been
exactly
certain
what
to
say
about
your
boys
i
confess
that
until
now
i
have
been
blind
to
some
of
their
virtues
and
have
imagined
i
detected
an
occasional
fault
but
the
scales
have
fallen
from
my
eyes
and
i
see
clearly
that
my
nephews
are
angels
positively
angels
if
i
seem
to
speak
extravagantly
i
beg
to
refer
you
to
alice
mayton
for
collateral
evidence
do
come
home
at
all
everything
is
just
as
it
should
be
even
if
you
come
i
guess
i
invite
myself
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
summer
with
you
i
changed
my
mind
about
its
being
a
bore
to
live
out
of
town
and
take
trains
back
and
forth
every
day
ask
tom
to
think
over
such
bits
of
real
estate
in
your
neighborhood
as
he
imagines
i
might
like
i
repeat
it
the
boys
are
angels
and
alice
mayton
is
another
while
the
happiest
man
in
the
white
goods
trade
is
your
affectionate
brother
harry
early
next
morning
i
sought
the
society
of
my
nephews
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
overflow
to
some
one
some
one
who
was
sympathetic
and
innocent
and
pure
i
longed
for
my
sister
my
mother
but
to
some
one
i
must
talk
at
once
budge
fulfilled
my
requirements
exactly
he
was
an
excellent
listener
very
sympathetic
by
nature
and
quick
to
respond
not
the
wisdom
of
the
most
reverend
sage
alive
could
have
been
so
grateful
to
my
ear
as
that
child
prattle
was
on
that
delightful
morning
as
for
toddie
blessed
be
the
law
of
compensation
his
faculty
of
repetition
and
of
echoing
whatever
he
heard
said
caused
him
to
murmur
miff
mayton
miff
mayton
all
morning
long
and
the
sound
gained
in
sweetness
by
its
ceaseless
iteration
to
be
sure
budge
took
early
and
frequent
occasions
to
remind
me
of
my
promises
of
the
night
before
and
toddie
occasionally
demanded
the
promised
candy
cigar
but
these
very
interruptions
only
added
joy
to
my
own
topic
of
interest
each
time
it
was
resumed
the
filling
of
budge
orders
occupied
two
or
three
hours
and
all
the
vacant
space
in
the
carriage
even
then
the
goat
and
were
compelled
to
follow
behind
the
program
for
the
afternoon
was
arranged
to
the
satisfaction
of
every
one
i
gave
the
coachman
mike
a
dollar
to
harness
the
goat
and
teach
the
children
to
drive
him
this
left
me
free
to
drive
off
without
being
followed
by
two
small
figures
and
two
pitiful
howls
i
always
believed
a
horse
was
infected
by
the
spirit
of
his
driver
my
dear
old
military
companions
always
seemed
to
perfectly
comprehend
my
desires
and
intentions
and
certainly
my
horses
entered
into
my
own
spirits
on
this
particular
afternoon
they
stepped
proudly
they
arched
their
powerful
necks
handsomely
their
feet
seemed
barely
to
touch
the
ground
yet
they
did
not
grow
restive
under
the
bit
nor
were
they
frightened
even
at
a
hideous
steam
machine
which
passed
us
as
i
drove
up
to
door
i
found
that
most
of
the
boarders
were
on
the
piazza
the
memories
of
ladies
are
usually
good
at
times
alice
immediately
appeared
composed
of
course
but
more
radiant
than
ever
why
where
are
the
boys
she
exclaimed
i
was
afraid
they
might
annoy
your
mother
i
replied
so
i
left
them
behind
oh
mother
hardly
feels
well
enough
to
go
today
said
she
she
is
lying
down
then
we
can
pick
up
the
boys
on
the
road
said
i
for
which
remark
my
enchantress
already
descending
the
steps
gave
me
a
look
which
the
ladies
behind
her
would
have
given
their
best
switches
to
have
seen
we
drove
off
as
decorously
as
if
it
were
sunday
and
we
were
driving
to
church
we
industriously
pointed
out
to
each
other
every
handsome
garden
and
tasteful
residence
we
passed
we
met
other
people
driving
and
conversed
fluently
upon
their
horses
carriages
and
dress
but
when
we
reached
the
edge
of
the
town
and
i
turned
into
happy
valley
a
road
following
the
depressions
and
curves
of
a
long
valley
in
which
there
was
not
a
single
straight
line
i
turned
and
looked
into
my
darling
face
her
eyes
met
mine
and
although
they
were
full
of
a
happiness
which
i
had
never
seen
in
them
before
they
filled
with
tears
and
their
dear
owner
dropped
her
head
on
my
shoulder
what
we
said
on
that
long
drive
would
not
interest
the
reader
i
have
learned
by
experience
to
skip
all
love
talks
in
novels
no
matter
how
delightful
the
lovers
may
be
recalling
now
our
conversation
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
have
had
anything
wonderful
it
in
i
will
only
say
that
if
i
had
been
happy
on
the
evening
before
my
happiness
now
seemed
to
be
sanctified
to
be
favored
with
the
love
and
confidence
of
a
simple
girl
scarcely
past
her
childhood
is
to
receive
a
greater
honor
than
court
or
field
can
bestow
but
even
this
honor
is
far
surpassed
by
that
which
comes
to
a
man
when
a
woman
of
rare
intelligence
tact
and
knowledge
of
society
and
the
world
unburdens
her
heart
of
all
its
hopes
and
fears
and
unhesitatingly
leaves
her
destiny
to
be
shaped
by
his
love
women
like
alice
mayton
do
not
thus
give
themselves
unreservedly
away
except
when
their
trust
is
born
of
knowledge
as
well
as
affection
and
the
realization
of
all
this
changed
me
on
that
afternoon
from
whatever
i
had
been
into
what
i
had
long
hoped
i
might
one
day
be
but
the
hours
flew
rapidly
and
i
reluctantly
turned
the
horses
heads
homeward
we
had
left
almost
the
whole
of
happy
valley
behind
us
and
were
approaching
residences
again
now
we
must
be
very
proper
said
alice
certainly
i
replied
here
a
good
by
to
happy
nonsense
for
this
afternoon
i
leaned
toward
her
and
gently
placed
one
arm
about
her
neck
she
raised
her
dear
face
from
which
joy
and
trust
had
banished
every
indication
of
caution
and
reserve
my
lips
sought
hers
when
suddenly
we
heard
a
most
unearthly
discordant
shriek
which
presently
separated
into
two
each
of
which
prolonged
itself
indefinitely
the
horses
started
and
alice
blessed
be
all
frights
now
henceforth
and
forevermore
clung
tightly
to
me
the
sounds
seemed
to
be
approaching
us
and
were
accompanied
by
a
lively
rattling
noise
that
seemed
to
be
made
by
something
wooden
suddenly
as
we
approached
a
bend
of
the
road
i
saw
my
youngest
nephew
appear
from
some
unknown
space
describe
a
parabolic
curve
in
the
air
ricochet
slightly
from
an
earthy
protuberance
in
the
road
and
make
a
final
stop
in
the
gutter
at
the
same
time
there
appeared
from
behind
the
bend
the
goat
then
the
carriage
dragging
on
one
side
and
lastly
the
boy
budge
grasping
tightly
the
back
of
the
carriage
body
and
howling
frightfully
a
direct
collision
between
the
carriage
and
a
stone
caused
budge
to
loose
his
hold
while
the
goat
after
taking
in
the
scene
trotted
leisurely
off
and
disappeared
in
a
road
leading
to
the
house
of
his
late
owner
budge
i
shouted
stop
that
bawling
and
come
here
where
mike
he
boo
hoo
went
to
hoo
light
his
boo
hoo
hoo
pipe
an
i
just
let
the
boo
hoo
whip
go
against
to
the
goat
an
then
he
scattooed
nashty
old
goat
scaddooed
said
toddie
in
corroboration
well
walk
right
home
and
tell
maggie
to
wash
and
dress
you
said
i
o
harry
pleaded
alice
after
they
been
in
such
danger
come
here
to
your
own
aunt
alice
budgie
dear
and
you
too
toddie
you
know
you
said
we
could
pick
the
boys
up
on
the
road
harry
there
there
do
cry
let
me
wipe
the
ugly
old
dirt
off
you
and
kiss
the
face
and
make
it
well
alice
i
protested
do
let
those
dirty
boys
clamber
all
over
you
in
that
way
silence
sir
said
she
with
mock
dignity
who
gave
me
my
lover
i
should
like
to
ask
so
we
drove
up
to
the
with
the
air
of
people
who
had
been
devoting
themselves
to
a
couple
of
very
disreputable
children
and
i
drove
swiftly
away
again
lest
the
children
should
dispel
the
illusion
we
soon
met
mike
running
the
moment
he
recognized
us
he
shouted
aye
ye
little
dhivils
beggin
yer
pardon
masther
harry
thankin
the
howly
mither
that
their
little
bones
ai
broke
to
bits
av
they
saw
a
hippypottymus
hitched
to
chariot
they
think
jist
the
byes
to
take
the
bossin
av
it
the
spalpeens
but
no
number
of
ordinary
hippopotami
and
chariots
could
have
disturbed
the
heavenly
tranquillity
of
my
mind
on
this
most
glorious
of
evenings
even
a
subtle
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
seemed
to
overshadow
my
nephews
perhaps
the
touch
of
my
enchantress
did
it
perhaps
it
came
only
from
the
natural
relapse
from
great
excitement
but
no
matter
what
the
reason
was
the
fact
remains
that
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
two
very
dirty
suits
of
clothes
held
two
children
who
gave
one
some
idea
of
how
the
denizens
of
paradise
might
seem
and
act
they
even
ate
their
suppers
without
indulging
in
any
of
the
repulsive
ways
of
which
they
had
so
large
an
assortment
and
they
did
not
surreptitiously
remove
from
the
table
any
fragments
of
bread
and
butter
to
leave
on
the
piano
in
the
and
other
places
inappropriate
to
the
reception
of
such
varieties
of
abandoned
property
they
demanded
a
song
after
supper
but
when
i
sang
drink
to
me
only
with
thine
eyes
and
thou
thou
in
this
bosom
they
stood
by
with
silent
tongues
and
appreciative
eyes
when
they
went
to
bed
i
accompanied
them
by
special
invitation
but
they
showed
no
disposition
to
engage
in
the
usual
bedtime
frolic
and
miniature
pandemonium
budge
when
in
bed
closed
his
eyes
folded
his
hand
and
prayed
dear
lord
bless
papa
an
mamma
an
toddie
an
uncle
harry
everybody
else
yes
an
bless
just
lots
that
lovely
lovely
lady
that
comforted
me
after
the
goat
was
bad
to
me
an
let
her
comfort
me
lots
of
times
for
christ
sake
amen
and
toddie
wriggled
twisted
breathed
heavily
threw
his
head
back
and
prayed
dee
lord
do
let
dat
old
goat
fro
me
into
de
gutter
on
my
head
aden
an
let
ocken
hawwy
an
ze
pitty
lady
be
dere
netst
time
i
dest
hurted
then
the
salutations
were
exchanged
and
i
left
the
little
darlings
and
enjoyed
communion
with
my
own
thoughts
which
were
as
peaceful
and
ecstatic
as
if
the
world
contained
no
white
goods
houses
no
doubtful
customers
no
business
competition
no
politics
gold
rooms
doubtful
banks
political
scandals
personal
iniquity
nor
anything
which
should
prevent
a
short
vacation
from
lasting
through
a
long
lifetime
the
next
morning
would
have
struck
terror
to
the
heart
of
any
one
but
a
newly
accepted
lover
rain
was
falling
fast
and
in
that
steady
industrious
manner
which
seemed
to
assert
an
intention
to
stick
closely
to
business
for
the
whole
day
the
sky
was
covered
by
one
impenetrable
leaden
cloud
water
stood
in
pools
in
the
streets
which
were
soft
with
dust
a
few
hours
before
the
flowers
all
hung
their
heads
like
vagabonds
who
had
been
awake
all
night
and
were
ashamed
to
face
the
daylight
even
the
chickens
stood
about
in
dejected
attitudes
and
stray
roosters
from
other
found
refuge
in
tom
coop
without
first
being
subjected
to
a
trial
of
strength
and
skill
by
but
no
man
in
my
condition
of
mind
could
be
easily
depressed
by
bad
weather
i
would
rather
have
been
able
to
drive
about
under
a
clear
sky
or
lounge
under
the
trees
or
walk
to
the
in
the
afternoon
by
the
road
which
passed
directly
in
front
of
but
man
should
not
live
for
himself
alone
in
the
room
next
mine
were
slumbering
two
wee
people
to
whom
i
owed
a
great
deal
who
would
mourn
bitterly
when
they
saw
the
condition
of
the
skies
and
ground
i
would
devote
myself
to
the
task
of
making
them
so
happy
that
they
would
forget
the
absence
of
sunshine
out
of
doors
i
would
sit
by
their
bedside
and
have
a
story
ready
for
them
the
moment
they
awoke
and
put
them
in
such
a
good
humor
that
they
could
laugh
with
me
at
cloud
and
rain
i
began
at
once
to
construct
a
story
for
their
especial
benefit
the
scene
was
to
be
a
country
residence
on
a
rainy
day
and
the
actors
two
little
boys
who
should
become
uproariously
jolly
in
spite
of
the
weather
like
most
people
not
used
to
my
progress
was
not
very
rapid
in
fact
i
had
got
no
farther
than
the
plot
indicated
above
when
an
angry
snarl
came
from
the
children
room
what
the
matter
budge
i
shouted
dressing
myself
as
rapidly
as
possible
ow

the
somewhat
complicated
response

well

if
you
do
stop
being
so
cross
the
only
reply
to
this
was
a
mighty
and
audible
rustling
of
the
bedding
in
the
boys
room
followed
by
a
sound
strongly
resembling
that
caused
by
a
slap
then
came
a
prolonged
wail
resembling
that
of
an
ungreased
what
the
matter

boy
room
both
my
nephews
were
sitting
up
in

looking
as
sullen
as

old

toddie
with

streaming
all
over

face

toddie
then

i
shouted
dragging
him
across
the
room
and
snatching
up
his
tiny
articles
of
apparel
i
had
dressed
no
small
children
since
i
was
rather
a
small
boy
myself
and
toddie
clothing
confused
me
somewhat
i
finally
got
something
on
him
when
a
contemptuous
laugh
from
budge
interrupted
me
how
you
goin
to
put
his
shirt
on
under
them
things
queried
my
oldest
nephew
budge
i
retorted
how
are

going
to
get
any
breakfast
if
you
do
put
on
something
besides
that
stocking
the
young
man
countenance
fell
and
just
then
the
breakfast
bell
rang
budge
raised
a
blank
face
hurried
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
shouted
maggie
what
is
it
budge
was
was
that
the
or
the
was
the
there

dead
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
budge
shouted
well

call
that
the
you
can
ring
another
bell
for
breakfast
pretty
soon
when
i
get
dressed
then
this
volunteer
adjuster
of
household
affairs
came
calmly
back
and
commenced
dressing
in
good
earnest
while
i
labored
along
with
toddie
wardrobe
where
the
budge
said
i
it
i
oh

and
bringing

i
throwing
the
toad
out
the
window
where
it
was
followed
by
an
agonizing
shriek
from
toddie
again
he
felt
and
his
search
was
rewarded
by
the
tension
screw
of
helen
then
i
attempted
some
research
myself
and
speedily
found
my
fingers
adhering
to
something
of
a
sticky
consistency
i
quickly
withdrew
my
hand
exclaiming
what
nasty
stuff
have
you
got
in
your
pocket
toddie
nashty
tuff

an
an
its

me
hazh
little
in
de
an
we
eats
it
it
dovely
all
this
was
lucid
and
disgusting
but
utterly
unproductive
of
and
meanwhile
the
breakfast
was
growing
cold
i
succeeded
in
buttoning
toddie
shoes
with
my
fingers
splitting
most
of
my
nails
in
the
operation
i
had
been
too
busily
engaged
with
toddie
to
pay
any
attention
to
budge
who
i
now
found
about
half
dressed
and
trying
to
catch
flies
on
the
windowpane
snatching
toddie
i
started
for
the
when
budge
remarked
reprovingly
uncle
harry
you
was
dressed
when
the
bell
rang
and
you
to
have
any
breakfast
true
enough
i
was
minus
collar
cravat
and
coat
hurrying
these
on
and
starting
again
i
was
once
more
arrested
uncle
harry
must
i
brush
my
teeth
this
morning
no
hurry
up
come
down
without
doing
anything
more
if
you
like
but
come

be
before
we
get
breakfast
then
that
imp
was
moved
for
the
first
time
that
morning
to
something
like
and
he
exclaimed
with
a
giggle
my
what
big
stomachs
we
have
when
we
got
done
would
we
at
the
breakfast
table
toddie
wept
again
because
i
insisted
on
beginning
operations
before
budge
came
then
neither
boys
knew
exactly
what
he
wanted
then
budge
managed
to
upset
the
contents
of
his
plate
into
his
lap
and
while
i
was
helping
him
clear
away
the
debris
toddie
improved
the
opportunity
to
pour
his
milk
upon
his
fish
and
put
several
spoonfuls
of
oatmeal
porridge
into
my
i
made
an
early
excuse
to
leave
the
table
and
turn
the
children
over
to
maggie
i
felt
as
tired
as
if
i
had
done
a
hard
day
work
and
was
somewhat
appalled
at
realizing
that
the
day
had
barely
begun
i
lit
a
cigar
and
sat
down
to
helen
piano
i
am
not
a
musician
but
even
the
chords
of
a
would
have
seemed
sweet
music
to
me
on
that
morning
the
nearest
to
my
hand
was
a
church
and
the
first
air
my
eye
struck
was
greenville
i
lived
once
in
a
town
where
on
a
single
day
a
pedler
disposed
of
accordeons
each
with
an
in
which
this
same
air
under
its
original
name
was
the
only
air
for
years
after
a
single
bar
of
this
air
awakened
the
most
melancholy
reflections
in
my
mind
but
now
i
forgave
all
my
musical
tormentors
as
the
familiar
strains
came
comfortingly
from
the
but
suddenly
i
heard
an
accompaniment
a
sort
of
reedy
sound
and
looking
around
i
saw
toddie
again
in
tears
i
stopped
abruptly
and
asked
what
the
matter
now
toddie
do
want
dat
old
tune
wantsh
dancin
tune
so
i
can
dance
i
promptly
played
yankee
doodle
and
toddie
began
to
trot
around
the
room
with
the
expression
of
a
man
who
intended
to
do
his
whole
duty
then
budge
appeared
hugging
a
bound
volume
of
st
nicholas
the
moment
toddie
espied
this
he
stopped
dancing
and
devoted
himself
anew
to
the
task
of
weeping
toddie
i
shouted
springing
from
the
what
do
you
mean
by
crying
at
everything
i
shall
have
to
put
you
to
bed
again
if
you
going
to
be
such
a
baby
that
the
way
he
always
does
rainy
days
explained
budge
wantsh
to
see
the
what
fwollowed
djonah
sobbed
toddie
ca
you
demand
something
that
within
the
range
of
possibility
toddie
i
mildly
asked
the
whale
toddie
means
is
in
this
big
red
book
i
find
it
for
you
said
budge
turning
over
the
leaves
suddenly
a
rejoicing
squeal
from
toddie
announced
that
leviathan
had
been
found
and
i
hastened
to
gaze
he
was
certainly
a
animal
but
he
had
an
enormous
mouth
which
toddie
caressed
with
his
pudgy
little
hand
and
kissed
with
tenderness
murmuring
as
he
did
so
dee
old
i
loves
you
is
jonah
all
goneded
out
of
you
i
finks
was
weal
mean
in
djonah
to
get
froed
up
when
you
had
noffin
else
to
eat
poor
old
of
course
jonah
gone
said
budge
he
went
to
heaven
long
ago
pretty
soon
after
he
went
to
nineveh
an
done
what
the
lord
told
him
to
do
now
swing
us
uncle
harry
the
swing
was
on
the
piazza
under
cover
from
the
rain
so
i
obeyed
both
boys
fought
for
the
right
to
swing
first
and
when
i
decided
in
favor
of
budge
toddie
went
off
weeping
and
declaring
that
he
would
look
at
his
dear
anyhow
a
moment
later
his
wail
changed
to
a
piercing
shriek
and
running
to
his
assistance
i
saw
him
holding
one
finger
tenderly
and
trampling
on
a
wasp
what
the
matter
toddie
oo
oo
ee
ee
ee
ee
i
putted
my
finger
on
a
waps
and
oo
oo
the
nasty
waps
oo
bited
me
an
i
do
like
wapses
a
bit
but
i
likes
oo
ee
ee
a
happy
thought
struck
me
why
do
you
boys
make
believe
that
big
in
your
is
a
whale
said
i
a
compound
shriek
of
delight
followed
the
suggestion
and
both
boys
scrambled
upstairs
leaving
me
a
free
man
again
i
looked
remorsefully
at
the
tableful
of
books
which
i
had
brought
to
read
and
had
not
looked
at
for
a
week
even
now
my
remorse
did
not
move
me
to
open
them
i
found
myself
instead
attracted
toward
tom
library
and
conning
the
titles
of
novels
and
volumes
of
poems
my
eye
was
caught
by
initial
a
which
i
had
always
avoided
because
i
had
heard
impressible
young
ladies
rave
about
it
but
now
i
picked
it
up
and
dropped
into
an
easy
chair
suddenly
i
heard
mike

coachman
shouting

just
then
two
great
hands
seized
toddie
frock
in
front
and
he
disappeared
with
a
howl
while
i
with
the
first
feeling
of
faintness
i
had
ever
experienced
went
in
search
of
hammer
nails
and
some
strips
of
board
to
nail
on
the
outside
of
the
but
boards
could
not
be
found
so
i
went
up
to
the
and
began
to
knock
a
piece
or
two
off
the
box
which
had
done
duty
as
whale
a
pitiful
scream
from
toddie
caused
me
to

det
out
nashty

mike
i
explained
that
mike
would
not
come
upstairs
again
so
i
was
permitted
to
depart
after
securing
the
window
again
i
settled
myself
with
book
and
cigar
there
was
at
least
for
me
the
extra
enjoyment
that
comes
from
the
sense
of
pleasure
earned
by
honest
toil
pretty
soon
budge
entered
the
room
i
affected
not
to
notice
him
but
he
was
not
in
the
least
abashed
by
my
neglect
uncle
harry
said
he
throwing
himself
in
my
lap
between
my
book
and
me
i
do
feel
a
bit
nice
what
the
matter
old
fellow
i
asked
until
he
spoke
i
could
have
boxed
his
ears
with
great
satisfaction
to
myself
but
there
is
so
much
genuine
feeling
in
whatever
budge
says
that
he
commands
respect
oh
i
tired
of
playin
with
toddie
an
i
feel
lonesome
wo
you
tell
me
a
story
then
what
poor
toddie
do
budge
oh
he
wo
mind
he
got
a
dead
mouse
to
be
jonah
now
so
i
have
no
fun
at
all
wo
you
tell
me
a
story
which
one

that
i
never
heard
before
at
all
well
let
see
i
guess
i
tell
ah
ah
ah
ah
ee
ee
ee
sounded
afar
off
but
fatefully
it
came
nearer
it
came
down
the
stairway
and
into
the
library
accompanied
by
toddie
who
on
spying
me
dropped
his
inarticulate
utterance
held
up
both
hands
and
exclaimed
djonah
bwoke
he
true
enough
in
one
hand
toddie
held
the
body
of
a
mouse
and
in
the
other
that
animal
caudal
appendage
there
was
also
perceptible
though
not
by
the
sense
of
sight
an
objectionable
odor
in
the
room
toddie
said
i
go
throw
jonah
into
the
and
i
give
you
some
candy
me
too
shouted
budge
cos
i
found
the
mouse
for
him
i
made
both
boys
happy
with
candy
exacted
a
pledge
not
to
go
out
in
the
rain
and
then
turning
them
loose
on
the
piazza
returned
to
my
book
i
had
read
perhaps
pages
when
there
arose
and
swelled
rapidly
in
volume
a
scream
from
toddie
madly
determined
to
put
both
boys
into
chairs
tie
them
and
clap
adhesive
plaster
over
their
mouths
i
rushed
out
upon
the
piazza
budgie
tried
to
eat
my
candy
complained
toddie
i
did
said
budge
what
did
you
do
i
demanded
i
did
bite
it
at
all
i
only
wanted
to
see
how
it
would
feel
between
my
teeth
that
all
i
felt
the
corners
of
my
mouth
breaking
down
and
hurried
back
to
the
library
where
i
spent
a
quiet
quarter
of
an
hour
in
pondering
over
the
demoralizing
influence
exerted
upon
principle
by
a
sense
of
the
ludicrous
for
some
time
afterward
the
boys
got
along
without
doing
anything
worse
than
make
a
dreadful
noise
which
caused
me
to
resolve
to
find
some
method
of
deadening
if
ever
owned
a
house
in
the
country
in
the
occasional
intervals
of
comparative
quiet
i
caught
snatches
of
very
funny
conversation
the
boys
had
coined
a
great
many
words
whose
meaning
was
evident
enough
but
i
wonder
greatly
why
tom
and
helen
had
never
taught
them
the
proper
substitutes
among
others
was
the
word
deader
whose
meaning
i
could
not
imagine
budge
shouted
o
tod
there
comes
a
deader
see
where
all
them
things
like
tails
are
well
there
a
deader
under
them
dasth
funny
remarked
toddie
an
see
all
the
peoples
along
continued
budge
they
know
the
deader
an
they
goin
to
see
it
fixed
here
it
comes
hello
deader
deader
echoed
toddie
what
could
deader
mean
oh
here
it
is
right
in
front
of
us
cried
budge
and
ai
there
lots
of
people
an
two
horses
to
pull
the
deader
some
deaders
has
only
one
my
curiosity
was
too
much
for
my
weariness
i
went
to
the
front
window
and
peering
through
saw
a
funeral
procession
in
a
second
i
was
on
the
piazza
with
my
hands
on
the
children
collars
a
second
later
two
small
boys
were
on
the
floor
of
the
hall
the
front
door
was
closed
and
two
determined
hands
covered
two
threatening
little
mouths
when
the
procession
had
fairly
passed
the
house
i
released
the
boys
and
heard
two
prolonged
howls
for
my
pains
then
i
asked
budge
if
he
ashamed
to
talk
that
way
when
a
funeral
was
passing
was
a
funeral
said
he
was
only
a
deader
an
deaders
hear
nothin
but
the
people
in
the
carriages
could
said
i
well
said
he
they
was
so
glad
that
the
other
part
of
the
deader
had
gone
to
heaven
that
they
did
care
what
i
said
glad
when
the
other
parts
of
deaders
go
to
heaven
papa
told
me
to
be
glad
that
dear
little
phillie
was
in
heaven
an
i
was
but
i
do
want
to
see
him
again
awful
wantsh
to
shee
phillie
aden
awfoo
said
toddie
as
i
kissed
budge
and
hurried
off
to
the
library
unfit
just
then
to
administer
farther
instruction
or
reproof
of
one
thing
i
was
very
certain
i
wished
the
rain
would
cease
falling
so
the
children
could
go
out
of
doors
and
i
could
get
a
little
rest
and
freedom
from
responsibility
but
the
skies
showed
no
signs
of
being
emptied
the
boys
were
snarling
on
the
stairway
and
i
was
losing
my
temper
quite
rapidly
suddenly
i
bethought
me
of
one
of
the
delights
of
my
own
childish
days
the
making
of
one
of
tom
library
drawers
held
a
great
many
lady
journals
of
course
helen
meant
to
have
them
bound
but
i
could
easily
repurchase
the
numbers
for
her
they
would
cost
two
or
three
dollars
but
peace
was
cheap
at
that
price
on
a
high
shelf
in
the
playroom
i
had
seen
some
supplementary
volumes
of
mercantile
agency
reports
which
would
in
time
reach
the
there
was
a
bottle
of
mucilage
in
the
and
the
children
owned
an
old
pair
of
scissors
within
five
minutes
i
had
located
two
happy
children
on
the
floor
taught
them
to
cut
out
pictures
which
operation
i
quickly
found
they
understood
as
well
as
i
did
and
to
paste
them
into
the
extemporized
then
i
left
them
recalling
something
from
newman
hall
address
on
the
dignity
of
labor
why
had
i
thought
before
of
showing
my
nephews
some
way
of
occupying
their
mind
and
hands
who
could
blame
the
helpless
little
things
for
following
every
prompting
of
their
unguided
minds
had
i
not
a
hundred
times
been
told
when
sent
to
the
or
the
weediest
part
of
the
garden
in
my
youthful
days
that
satan
finds
some
mischief
still
for
idle
hands
to
do
never
again
would
i
blame
children
for
being
mischievous
when
their
minds
were
neglected
i
spent
a
peaceful
pleasant
hour
over
my
novel
when
i
felt
that
a
fresh
cigar
would
be
acceptable
going
in
search
of
one
i
found
that
budge
had
filled
the
bathtub
with
water
and
was
sailing
boats
that
is
even
this
seemed
too
mild
an
offense
to
call
for
a
rebuke
so
i
passed
on
without
disturbing
him
and
went
to
my
own
room
i
heard
toddie
voice
and
having
heard
from
my
sister
that
toddie
conversations
with
himself
were
worth
listening
to
i
paused
outside
the
door
i
heard
toddie
softly
murmur
zere
pitty
yady
zere
now
boy
i
put
you
wif
your
mudder
tause
mudders
likes
zere
boys
wif
zem
an
you
sall
have
sister
tudder
side
of
you
zere
now
boy
an
girl
mudder
do
you
feel
happy
is
i
awfoo
good
to
give
you
your
tsilderns
you
ought
to
say
you
toddie
a
nice
fweet
djentleman
i
peered
cautiously
then
i
entered
the
room
hastily
i
did
say
anything
for
a
moment
for
it
was
impossible
to
do
justice
impromptu
to
the
subject
toddie
had
a
progressive
mind
if
pictorial
ornamentation
was
good
for
old
books
why
should
not
similar
ornamentation
be
extended
to
objects
more
likely
to
be
seen
such
may
not
have
been
toddie
line
of
thought
but
his
recent
operations
warranted
such
a
supposition
he
had
cut
out
a
number
of
pictures
and
pasted
them
upon
the
wall
of
my
room
my
sister
darling
room
with
its
walls
tinted
exquisitely
in
pink
as
a
member
of
a
hanging
committee
toddie
would
hardly
have
satisfied
taller
people
but
he
had
arranged
the
pictures
quite
regularly
at
about
the
height
of
his
own
eyes
had
favored
no
one
artist
more
than
another
and
had
hung
indiscriminately
figure
pieces
landscapes
and
genre
pictures
the
temporary
break
of
occasioned
by
the
door
communicating
with
his
own
room
he
had
overcome
by
closing
the
door
and
carrying
a
line
of
pictures
across
its
lower
panels
occasionally
a
picture
fell
off
the
wall
but
the
mucilage
remained
faithful
and
glistened
with
its
fervor
of
devotion
and
yet
so
untouched
was
i
by
this
artistic
display
that
when
i
found
strength
to
shout
toddie
it
was
in
a
tone
which
caused
this
industrious
amateur
decorator
to
start
violently
and
drop
his
open
end
first
upon
the
carpet
what
will
mamma
say
i
asked
toddie
gazed
first
blankly
and
then
inquiringly
into
my
face
finding
no
answer
or
sympathy
there
he
burst
into
tears
and
replied
i
dunno
the
ringing
of
the
changed
toddie
from
a
tearful
cherub
into
a
very
practical
boy
and
shouting
come
on
budge
he
hurried
while
i
tormented
myself
with
wonder
as
to
how
i
could
best
and
most
quickly
undo
the
mischief
toddie
had
done
i
will
concede
to
my
nephews
the
credit
of
keeping
reasonably
quiet
during
meals
their
tongues
doubtless
longed
to
be
active
in
both
the
principal
capacities
of
those
useful
members
but
they
had
no
doubt
as
to
how
to
choose
between
silence
and
hunger
the
result
was
a
reasonably
comfortable
just
as
i
began
to
cut
a
melon
budge
broke
the
silence
by
exclaiming
o
uncle
harry
we
have
been
out
to
see
the
goat
budge
i
replied
i
carry
you
out
there
under
an
umbrella
after
lunch
and
you
may
play
with
that
goat
all
the
afternoon
if
you
like
oh
wo
that
be
nice
exclaimed
budge
the
poor
goat
he
think
i
do
love
him
a
bit
i
have
been
to
see
him
does
goats
go
to
heaven
when
they
die
uncle
harry
guess
not
they
make
trouble
in
the
golden
streets
i
afraid
oh
dear
then
phillie
ca
see
my
goat
i
so
awful
sorry
said
budge
can
see
your
goat
budgie
suggested
toddie
huh
said
budge
very
contemptuously
you
ai
dead
well
izhe
goin
to
be
dead
some
day
zen
your
nashty
old
goat
see
me
a
bit
see
how
he
like
zat
and
toddie
made
a
ferocious
attack
on
a
slice
of
melon
nearly
as
large
as
himself
after
lunch
toddie
was
sent
to
his
room
to
take
his
afternoon
nap
and
budge
went
to
the
barn
on
my
shoulders
i
gave
mike
a
dollar
with
instructions
to
keep
budge
in
sight
to
keep
him
from
teasing
the
goat
and
to
prevent
his
being
impaled
or
butted
then
i
stretched
myself
on
a
lounge
and
wondered
whether
only
half
a
day
of
daylight
had
elapsed
since
i
and
the
most
adorable
woman
in
the
world
had
been
so
happy
together
how
much
happier
i
would
be
when
next
i
met
her
the
very
torments
of
this
rainy
day
would
make
my
joy
seem
all
the
dearer
and
more
intense
i
dreamed
happily
for
a
few
moments
with
my
eyes
open
and
then
somehow
they
closed
without
my
knowledge
what
put
into
my
mind
the
from
the
play
of
david
copperfield
i
know
but
there
it
came
and
in
my
dream
i
was
sitting
in
the
balcony
at
booth
and
taking
a
proper
interest
in
the
scene
when
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
thunder
had
less
of
reverberation
and
more
woodenness
than
good
stage
thunder
should
have
the
mental
exertion
i
underwent
on
this
subject
disturbed
the
course
of
my
nap
but
as
wakefulness
returned
the
sound
of
the
poorly
simulated
thunder
did
not
cease
on
the
contrary
it
was
just
as
noisy
and
more
hopelessly
a
counterfeit
than
ever
what
could
the
sound
be
i
stepped
through
the
window
to
the
piazza
and
the
sound
was
directly
over
my
head
i
sprang
down
the
terrace
and
out
upon
the
lawn
looked
up
and
beheld
my
youngest
nephew
strutting
back
and
forth
on
the
tin
roof
of
the
piazza
holding
over
his
head
a
ragged
old
parasol
i
roared
go
in
toddie
this
instant
the
sound
of
my
voice
startled
the
young
man
so
severely
that
he
lost
his
footing
fell
and
began
to
roll
toward
the
edge
and
to
scream
both
operations
being
performed
with
great
rapidity
i
ran
to
catch
him
as
he
fell
but
the
outer
edge
of
the
was
high
enough
to
arrest
his
progress
though
it
had
no
effect
in
reducing
the
volume
of
his
howls
toddie
i
shouted
lie
perfectly
still
until
uncle
can
get
to
you
do
you
hear
ess
but
do
want
to
lie
came
in
reply
from
the
roof
shee
noffin
but
sky
an
rain
lie
still
i
reiterated
or
i
whip
you
dreadfully
then
i
dashed
removed
my
shoes
climbed
out
and
rescued
toddie
shook
him
soundly
and
then
shook
myself
i
wazh
only
djust
pyayin
mamma
an
walkin
in
ze
yain
wif
an
umbayalla
toddie
explained
i
threw
him
upon
his
bed
and
departed
it
was
plain
that
neither
logic
threats
nor
the
presence
of
danger
could
keep
this
dreadful
child
from
doing
whatever
he
chose
what
other
means
of
restraint
could
be
employed
although
not
as
religious
a
man
as
my
good
mother
could
wish
i
really
wondered
whether
prayer
as
a
last
resort
might
not
be
effective
for
his
good
and
my
own
peace
i
would
cheerfully
have
read
through
the
whole
i
could
hardly
have
done
it
just
then
though
for
mike
solicited
an
audience
at
the
back
door
and
reported
that
budge
had
given
the
to
the
goat
put
handfuls
of
oats
into
the
pulled
hairs
out
of
the
black
mare
tail
and
with
a
sharp
nail
drawn
pictures
on
the
enamel
of
the
budge
made
no
denial
but
looked
very
much
aggrieved
and
remarked
that
he
could
never
be
happy
without
somebody
having
to
go
get
bothered
and
he
wished
there
was
nobody
in
the
world
but
and
men
he
followed
me
into
the
house
flung
himself
into
a
chair
put
on
a
look
which
i
imagine
byron
wore
before
he
was
old
enough
to
be
malicious
and
exclaimed
i
do
see
what
little
boys
was
made
for
anyhow
if
gets
cross
with
them
an
do
let
do
what
they
want
to
i
bet
when
i
get
to
heaven
the
lord
wo
be
as
ugly
to
me
as
mike
is
an
some
other
folks
too
i
wish
i
could
die
and
be
buried
right
away
me
the
goat
an
go
to
heaven
where
we
would
be
scolded
poor
little
fellow
first
i
laughed
inwardly
at
his
idea
of
heaven
and
then
i
wondered
whether
my
own
was
very
different
from
it
or
any
more
creditable
i
had
no
time
to
spend
even
in
pious
reflection
however
budge
was
quite
wet
his
shoes
were
soaking
and
he
already
had
an
attack
of
catarrh
so
i
took
him
to
his
room
and
him
wondering
all
the
while
how
much
similar
duties
my
own
father
had
had
to
do
by
me
had
shortened
his
life
and
how
with
such
a
son
as
i
was
he
lived
as
long
as
he
did
the
idea
that
i
was
in
some
slight
degree
atoning
for
my
early
sins
so
filled
my
thoughts
that
i
did
not
at
first
notice
the
absence
of
toddie
when
it
did
become
evident
to
me
that
my
youngest
nephew
was
not
in
the
bed
in
which
i
had
placed
him
i
went
in
search
of
him
he
was
in
none
of
the
chambers
but
hearing
gentle
murmurs
issue
from
a
long
light
closet
i
looked
in
and
saw
toddie
sitting
on
the
floor
and
eating
the
cheese
out
of
a
a
squeak
of
my
boots
betrayed
me
and
toddie
equal
to
the
emergency
sprang
to
his
feet
and
exclaimed
i
did
hurt
de
mousie
one
bittie
i
just
letted
him
out
and
he
runded
away
and
still
it
rained
oh
for
a
single
hour
of
sunlight
so
that
the
mud
might
be
only
damp
dirt
and
the
children
could
play
without
tormenting
other
people
but
it
was
not
to
be
slowly
and
by
the
aid
of
songs
stories
an
improvised
menagerie
in
which
i
personated
every
animal
besides
playing
ostrich
and
armadillo
and
a
great
many
disagreements
the
afternoon
wore
to
its
close
and
my
heart
slowly
lightened
only
an
hour
or
two
more
and
the
children
would
be
in
bed
for
the
night
and
then
i
would
enjoy
in
unutterable
measure
the
peaceful
hours
which
would
be
mine
even
now
they
were
inclined
to
behave
themselves
they
were
tired
and
hungry
and
stretched
themselves
on
the
floor
to
await
dinner
i
embraced
the
opportunity
to
return
to
my
book
but
i
had
hardly
read
a
page
when
a
combined
crash
and
scream
summoned
me
to
the
on
the
floor
lay
toddie
a
great
many
dishes
a
roast
leg
of
lamb
several
ears
of
green
corn
the
and
its
contents
and
several
other
misplaced
edibles
one
thing
was
quite
evident
the
scalding
contents
of
the
had
been
emptied
on
toddie
arm
and
how
severely
the
poor
child
might
be
scalded
i
did
not
know
i
hastily
slit
open
his
sleeve
from
wrist
to
shoulder
and
found
the
skin
very
red
so
remembering
my
mother
favorite
treatment
for
scalds
and
burns
i
quickly
spread
the
contents
of
a
dish
of
mashed
potato
on
a
clean
handkerchief
and
wound
the
whole
around
toddie
arm
as
a
poultice
then
i
demanded
an
explanation
i
was
only
djust
reatchin
for
a
pieshe
of
bwed
sobbed
toddie
then
the
bad
old
tabo
beginded
to
froe
all
its
fings
at
me
an
tumble
down
bang
he
undoubtedly
told
the
truth
as
far
as
he
knew
it
but
reaching
over
tables
is
a
bad
habit
in
small
boys
especially
when
their
mothers
cling
to
heirlooms
of
tables
which
have
folding
leaves
so
i
banished
toddie
to
his
room
supperless
to
think
of
what
he
had
done
with
budge
alone
i
had
a
comfortable
dinner
off
the
salvage
from
the
wreck
caused
by
toddie
and
then
i
went
to
see
if
the
offender
had
repented
it
was
hard
to
tell
by
sight
whether
he
had
or
not
for
his
back
was
to
me
as
he
flattened
his
nose
against
the
window
but
i
could
see
that
my
poultice
was
gone
where
is
what
uncle
put
on
your
arm
toddie
i
asked
i
ate
it
up
said
the
truthful
youth
did
you
eat
the
handkerchief
too
no
i
froed
nashty
old
handkerchief
out
the
window
do
want
dirty
old
handkerchiefs
in
my
nice
room
i
was
so
glad
that
his
burn
had
been
slight
that
i
forgave
the
insult
to
my
handkerchief
and
called
up
budge
so
that
i
might
at
once
get
both
boys
into
bed
and
emerge
from
the
bondage
in
which
i
had
lived
all
day
long
but
the
task
was
no
easy
one
of
course
my
tom
lawrence
knows
better
than
any
other
man
the
necessities
of
his
own
children
but
no
children
of
mine
shall
ever
be
taught
so
many
methods
of
imposing
upon
parental
good
nature
their
program
called
for
stories
songs
moral
conversations
frolics
the
presentation
of
pennies
the
dropping
of
the
same
at
long
intervals
into
tin
savings
banks
followed
by
a
deafening
of
both
banks
then
a
prayer
must
be
offered
and
no
conventional
one
would
be
tolerated
then
the
boys
performed
their
own
devotions
after
which
i
was
allowed
to
depart
with
an
interchange
of
god
bless
you
as
this
evening
i
left
the
room
with
their
innocent
benedictions
sounding
in
my
ears
a
sense
of
personal
weakness
induced
by
the
events
of
the
day
moved
me
to
fervently
respond
amen
mothers
of
american
boys
accept
from
me
a
tribute
of
respect
which
no
words
can
fitly
express
of
wonder
greater
than
any
of
the
great
things
of
the
world
ever
inspired
of
adoration
as
earnest
and
devout
as
the
catholic
pays
to
the
virgin
in
a
single
day
i
a
strong
man
with
nothing
else
to
occupy
my
mind
am
reduced
to
physical
and
mental
worthlessness
by
the
necessities
of
two
boys
not
overmischievous
or
bad
and
you
heaven
only
knows
how
have
unbroken
weeks
months
years
yes
lifetimes
of
just
such
experiences
and
with
them
the
burden
of
household
cares
of
physical
ills
and
depressions
of
mental
anxieties
that
pierce
your
hearts
with
as
many
sorrows
as
grieved
the
holy
mother
of
old
compared
with
thy
endurance
that
of
the
young
man
the
athlete
is
as
weakness
the
secret
of
thy
nerves
wonderful
even
in
their
weakness
is
as
great
as
that
of
the
power
of
the
winds
to
display
decision
thy
opportunities
are
more
frequent
than
those
of
the
greatest
statesman
thy
heroism
laughs
into
insignificance
that
of
fort
and
field
thou
art
trained
in
a
school
of
diplomacy
such
as
the
most
experienced
court
can
not
furnish
do
scoffers
say
thou
canst
not
hold
the
reins
of
government
easier
is
it
to
rule
a
band
of
savages
than
to
be
the
successful
autocrat
of
thy
little
kingdom
compared
with
the
ways
of
men
even
thy
failures
are
full
of
glory
be
thy
faults
what
they
may
thy
one
great
mysterious
unapproachable
success
places
thee
in
desert
far
above
warrior
rabbi
or
priest
the
foregoing
soliloquy
passed
through
my
mind
as
i
lay
upon
the
bed
where
i
had
thrown
myself
after
leaving
the
children
room
whatever
else
attempted
to
affect
me
mentally
found
my
mind
a
blank
until
the
next
morning
when
i
awoke
to
realize
that
i
had
dropped
asleep
just
where
i
fell
and
that
i
had
spent
nearly
twelve
hours
lying
across
a
bed
in
an
uncomfortable
position
and
without
removing
my
daily
attire
my
next
impression
was
that
quite
a
bulky
letter
had
been
pushed
under
my
could
it
be
that
my
darling
i
hastily
seized
the
envelope
and
found
it
addressed
in
my
sister
writing
and
promising
a
more
voluminous
letter
than
that
lady
had
ever
before
honored
me
with
i
opened
it
dropping
an
enclosure
which
doubtless
was
a
list
of
necessities
which
i
would
please
pack
and
read
as
follows
july
my
dear
old
brother
would
i
like
to
give
you
the
warmest
of
sisterly
hugs
i
ca
believe
it
and
yet
i
in
ecstasies
over
it
to
think
that
you
should
have
got
that
perfection
of
a
girl
who
has
declined
so
many
great
catches
you
my
sober
unromantic
big
brother
oh
it
too
wonderful
but
now
i
think
of
it
you
just
the
people
for
each
other
i
like
to
say
that
it
just
what
i
always
longed
for
and
that
i
invited
you
to
hillcrest
to
bring
it
about
but
the
trouble
with
such
a
story
would
be
that
it
would
have
a
word
of
truth
in
it
you
always
did
have
a
faculty
of
doing
just
what
you
pleased
and
what
nobody
ever
expected
you
to
do
but
now
you
exceeded
yourself
and
to
think
that
my
little
darlings
played
an
important
part
in
bringing
it
all
about
i
shall
take
the
credit
for
that
for
if
it
had
been
for
me
who
would
have
helped
you
sir
i
shall
expect
you
to
remember
both
of
them
handsomely
at
christmas
i
do
believe
i
guilty
of
a
breach
of
confidence
in
sending
the
enclosed
which
i
have
just
received
from
my
that
is
to
be
it
will
tell
you
some
causes
of
your
success
of
which
you
with
a
man
conceit
have
imagined
for
a
minute
and
it
will
tell
you
too
of
a
maiden
first
and
natural
fear
under
such
circumstances
a
fear
which
i
know
that
you
with
your
honest
generous
heart
will
hasten
to
dispel
as
you
a
man
you
quite
likely
to
be
too
stupid
to
read
what
written
between
the
lines
so
i
better
tell
you
that
alice
fear
is
that
in
letting
herself
go
so
easily
she
may
have
seemed
to
lack
proper
reserve
and
you
do
need
to
be
told
that
no
woman
alive
has
more
of
these
very
qualities
bless
your
dear
old
heart
harry
you
deserve
to
be
shaken
to
death
if
you
not
the
happiest
man
alive
i
must
hurry
home
and
see
you
both
with
my
own
eyes
and
learn
to
believe
that
all
this
wonderful
glorious
thing
has
come
to
pass
give
alice
a
sister
kiss
from
me
if
you
know
how
to
give
more
than
one
kind
and
give
my
cherubs
a
hundred
each
from
the
mother
that
wants
to
see
them
so
much
with
love
and
congratulations
helen
the
other
letter
which
i
opened
with
considerable
reverence
and
more
delight
ran
as
follows
hillcrest
june
dear
friend
helen
something
has
happened
and
i
am
very
happy
but
i
am
more
than
a
little
troubled
over
it
too
and
as
you
are
one
of
the
persons
nearly
concerned
i
am
going
to
confess
to
you
as
soon
as
possible
harry
your
brother
i
mean
will
be
sure
to
tell
you
very
soon
if
he
has
done
so
already
and
i
want
to
make
all
possible
haste
to
solemnly
assure
you
that
had
the
slightest
idea
of
such
a
thing
coming
to
pass
and
i
did
do
the
slightest
thing
to
bring
it
about
i
always
thought
your
brother
was
a
splendid
fellow
and
have
never
been
afraid
to
express
my
mind
about
him
when
there
was
no
one
but
girls
to
listen
but
out
here
i
somehow
learned
to
admire
him
more
than
ever
i
cheerfully
acquit
him
of
intentionally
doing
anything
to
create
a
favorable
impression
if
his
several
appearances
before
me
have
been
studied
he
is
certainly
the
most
original
being
i
ever
heard
of
your
children
are
angels
you
told
me
so
yourself
and
i
my
own
very
distinct
impression
on
the
subject
but
they
do
study
to
save
their
uncle
appearance
the
figures
that
unfortunate
man
has
cut
several
times
well
i
wo
try
to
describe
them
on
paper
for
fear
he
might
some
day
see
a
scrap
of
it
and
take
offense
but
he
always
seems
to
be
patient
with
them
and
devoted
to
them
and
i
have
been
able
to
keep
from
seeing
that
a
man
who
could
be
so
lovable
with
thoughtless
and
unreasonable
children
must
be
perfectly
adorable
to
the
woman
he
loved
if
she
were
a
woman
at
all
still
i
had
the
faintest
idea
that
i
would
be
the
fortunate
woman
at
last
the
day
came
but
i
was
in
blissful
ignorance
of
what
was
to
happen
your
little
charley
hurt
himself
and
insisted
upon
har
your
brother
singing
an
odd
song
to
him
and
just
when
the
young
gentleman
was
doing
the
elegant
to
a
dozen
of
us
ladies
at
once
too
if
you
could
have
seen
his
face
it
was
too
funny
until
he
got
over
his
annoyance
and
began
to
feel
properly
sorry
for
the
little
fellow
then
he
seemed
all
at
once
to
be
all
tenderness
and
heart
and
i
did
wish
for
a
moment
that
conventionalities
did
exist
and
i
might
tell
him
that
he
was
a
model
then
your
youngest
playfully
spilt
a
plate
of
soup
on
my
dress
do
be
worried
was
only
a
common
muslin
and
wash
of
course
i
had
to
change
it
and
as
i
retired
the
happy
thought
struck
me
that
i
make
so
elaborate
a
toilet
that
i
would
finish
in
time
to
join
the
other
ladies
for
the
usual
evening
walk
consequence
i
would
have
a
chance
to
monopolize
a
gentleman
for
half
an
hour
or
more
a
chance
which
no
thanks
to
the
gentlemen
who
do
come
to
hillcrest
no
lady
here
has
had
this
season
every
time
i
peered
through
the
blinds
to
see
if
the
other
girls
had
started
i
could
see
him
looking
so
distressed
and
brooding
over
those
two
children
as
if
he
was
their
mother
and
he
seemed
so
good
he
seemed
pleased
to
see
me
when
i
appeared
and
coming
from
such
a
man
the
implied
compliment
was
fully
appreciated
everything
he
said
to
me
seemed
a
little
more
worth
hearing
than
if
it
had
come
from
any
man
not
so
good
then
suddenly
your
eldest
insisted
on
retailing
the
result
of
a
conversation
he
had
had
with
his
uncle
and
the
upshot
was
that
harry
declared
himself
he
was
romantic
a
bit
but
he
was
real
straightforward
and
manly
while
i
was
so
completely
taken
aback
that
i
could
think
of
a
thing
to
say
then
the
impudent
fellow
kissed
me
and
i
lost
my
tongue
worse
than
ever
if
i
had
known
anything
of
his
feelings
beforehand
i
should
have
been
prepared
to
behave
more
properly
but
o
helen
i
so
glad
i
did
know
i
should
be
the
happiest
being
that
ever
lived
if
i
was
afraid
that
you
and
your
husband
might
think
that
i
had
given
myself
away
too
hastily
as
to
other
people
we
will
see
that
they
do
know
a
word
about
it
for
months
to
come
do
write
that
i
was
not
to
blame
and
make
believe
accept
me
as
a
sister
because
i
ca
offer
to
give
harry
up
to
any
one
else
you
may
have
picked
out
for
him
your
sincere
friend
alice
mayton
was
there
ever
so
delightful
a
reveille
all
the
boyishness
in
me
seemed
suddenly
to
come
to
the
surface
and
instead
of
saying
and
doing
the
decorous
things
which
novelists
heroes
do
under
similar
circumstances
i
shouted
hurrah
and
danced
into
the
children
room
so
violently
that
budge
sat
up
in
bed
and
regarded
me
with
reproving
eyes
while
toddie
burst
into
a
happy
laugh
and
volunteered
as
a
partner
in
the
dance
then
i
realized
that
the
rain
was
over
and
the
sun
was
shining
i
could
take
alice
out
for
another
drive
and
until
then
the
children
could
take
care
of
themselves
i
remembered
suddenly
and
with
a
sharp
pang
that
my
vacation
was
nearly
at
an
end
and
i
found
myself
consuming
with
impatience
to
know
how
much
longer
alice
would
remain
at
hillcrest
it
would
be
cruel
to
wish
her
in
the
city
before
the
end
of
august
yet
i
uncle
harry
said
budge
my
papa
says
is
nice
for
folks
to
sit
down
and
go
to
thinkin
before
they
brushed
their
hair
mornin
that
what
he
tells
me
i
beg
your
pardon
budge
said
i
springing
up
in
some
confusion
i
was
thinking
over
a
matter
of
a
great
deal
of
importance
what
was
it
my
goat
no
of
course
not
do
be
silly
budge
well
i
think
about
him
a
good
deal
an
i
do
think
it
silly
a
bit
i
hope
he
go
to
heaven
when
he
dies
do
angels
have
uncle
harry
no
old
fellow
they
can
go
about
without
carriages
when
goesh
to
hebben
said
toddie
rising
in
bed
izhe
goin
to
have
lots
of
an
izhe
goin
to
tate
all
ze
andjels
a
widen
with
many
other
bits
of
prophecy
and
celestial
description
i
was
regaled
as
i
completed
my
toilet
and
i
hurried
out
of
doors
for
an
opportunity
to
think
without
disturbance
strolling
past
the
henyard
i
saw
a
meditative
turtle
and
picking
him
up
and
shouting
to
my
nephews
i
held
the
reptile
up
for
their
inspection
their
flew
open
and
a
unanimous
though
not
exactly
harmonious
oh
greeted
my
prize
where
did
you
get
it
uncle
harry
asked
budge
down
by
the
budge
eyes
opened
wide
he
seemed
to
devote
a
moment
to
profound
thought
and
then
he
exclaimed
why
i
do
see
how
the
hens
could
lay
such
a
big
thing
just
put
him
in
your
hat
till
i
come
down
will
you
i
dropped
the
turtle
in
budge
wheelbarrow
and
made
a
tour
of
the
the
flowers
always
full
of
suggestion
to
me
seemed
suddenly
to
have
new
charms
and
powers
they
actually
impelled
me
to
try
to
make
rhymes
me
a
steady
salesman
the
impulse
was
too
strong
to
be
resisted
though
i
must
admit
that
the
results
were
pitifully
meager
as
radiant
as
that
matchless
rose
which
fancy
as
fair
as
whitest
as
modest
as
the
pansy
as
pure
as
dew
which
hides
within
aurora
chalice
as
tender
as
the
primrose
sweet
all
this
and
more
is
alice
in
inflicting
this
fragment
upon
the
reader
i
have
not
the
faintest
idea
that
he
can
discover
any
merit
in
it
i
quote
it
only
that
a
subsequent
experience
of
mine
may
be
more
intelligible
when
i
had
composed
these
wretched
lines
i
became
conscious
that
i
had
neither
pencil
nor
paper
wherewith
to
preserve
them
should
i
lose
them
my
first
poem
never
this
was
not
the
first
time
in
which
i
had
found
it
necessary
to
preserve
words
by
memory
alone
so
i
repeated
my
ridiculous
lines
over
and
over
again
until
the
eloquent
feeling
of
which
they
were
the
graceless
expression
inspired
me
to
accompany
my
recital
with
gestures
six
eight
ten
a
dozen
twenty
times
i
repeated
these
lines
each
time
with
additional
emotion
and
gestures
when
a
thin
voice
very
near
me
remarked
ocken
hawwy
you
does
djust
as
if
you
was
swimmin
turning
i
beheld
my
nephew
toddie
how
long
he
had
been
behind
me
i
had
no
idea
he
looked
earnestly
into
my
eyes
and
then
remarked
ocken
hawwy
your
faysh
is
wed
djust
like
a
let
go
right
in
to
breakfast
toddie
said
i
aloud
as
i
grumbled
to
myself
about
the
faculty
of
observation
which
tom
children
seemed
to
have
immediately
after
breakfast
i
despatched
mike
with
a
note
to
alice
informing
her
that
i
would
be
glad
to
drive
her
to
the
falls
in
the
afternoon
calling
for
her
at
two
then
i
placed
myself
unreservedly
at
the
disposal
of
the
boys
for
the
morning
it
being
distinctly
understood
that
they
must
not
expect
to
see
me
between
lunch
and
dinner
i
was
first
instructed
to
harness
the
goat
which
order
i
obeyed
and
i
afterward
watched
that
grave
animal
as
he
drew
my
nephews
up
and
down
the
his
countenance
as
demure
as
if
he
had
no
idea
of
suddenly
departing
when
my
back
should
be
turned
the
wheels
of
the
goat
carriage
uttered
the
most
heartrending
noises
i
had
ever
heard
from
ungreased
axle
so
i
persuaded
the
boys
to
dismount
and
submit
to
the
temporary
unharnessing
of
the
goat
while
i
should
lubricate
the
axles
half
an
hour
of
dirty
work
sufficed
with
such
assistance
as
i
gained
from
juvenile
advice
to
accomplish
the
task
properly
then
i
put
the
horned
steed
into
the
shafts
budge
cracked
the
whip
the
carriage
moved
off
without
noise
and
toddie
began
to
weep
bitterly
cawwidge
is
all
bwoke
said
he
wheelsh
do
sing
a
bittie
no
more
while
budge
remarked
i
think
the
carriage
sounds
kind
o
lonesome
now
do
you
uncle
harry
uncle
harry
asked
budge
a
little
later
in
the
morning
do
you
know
what
makes
the
thunder
yes
budge
when
two
clouds
go
bump
into
each
other
they
make
a
good
deal
of
noise
and
they
call
it
thunder
that
ai
it
at
all
said
budge
when
it
thundered
yesterday
it
was
because
the
lord
was
riding
along
through
the
sky
and
the
wheels
of
his
carriage
made
an
awful
noise
an
that
was
the
thunder
do
like
nashty
old
remarked
toddie
it
goesh
into
our
cellar
an
makesh
all
ze
milk
sour
maggie
said
so
an
so
i
ca
hazh
no
nice
white
tea
for
my
brepspup
i
should
think
you
like
the
lord
to
go
a
ridin
toddie
with
all
the
angels
running
after
him
said
budge
even
if
the
thunder
does
make
the
milk
sour
and
is
so
splendid
to
see
the
thunder
bang
how
do
you
see
it
budge
i
asked
why
do
you
know
when
the
thunder
bangs
and
then
you
see
an
awful
bright
place
in
the
sky
that
where
the
lord
carriage
gives
an
awful
pound
and
makes
little
cracks
through
the
floor
of
heaven
we
see
right
in
but
what
the
reason
we
ca
ever
see
anybody
through
the
cracks
uncle
harry
i
do
know
old
fellow
i
guess
it
because
it
is
cracks
in
heaven
that
look
so
bright
it
a
kind
of
fire
that
the
lord
makes
up
in
the
clouds
you
know
all
about
it
when
you
get
bigger
well
i
feel
awful
sorry
if
anything
but
fire
do
you
know
that
funny
song
my
papa
sings
thunders
lightenin
blazes
shout
the
great
creator
praises
i
do
know
zactly
what
it
means
but
i
think
it
kind
o
splendid
do
you
i
did
know
the
old
song
i
had
heard
it
in
a
western
when
scarcely
older
than
budge
and
it
left
upon
my
mind
just
the
effect
it
seemed
to
have
done
on
his
i
blessed
his
sympathetic
young
heart
and
snatched
him
into
my
arms
instantly
he
became
all
boy
again
uncle
harry
he
shouted
you
crawl
on
your
hands
and
knees
and
play
you
was
a
horse
and
i
ride
on
your
back
no
thank
you
budge
not
on
the
dirt
then
let
play
menagerie
an
you
be
all
the
animals
to
this
proposition
i
assented
and
after
hiding
ourselves
in
one
of
the
retired
angles
of
the
house
so
that
no
one
could
know
who
was
guilty
of
disturbing
the
peace
by
such
dire
noises
the
performance
commenced
i
was
by
turns
a
bear
a
lion
a
zebra
an
elephant
dogs
of
various
kinds
and
a

bereft
of
a
playmate
for
the
doctor
little
girl
was
sick
so
he
quietly
followed
me
about
with
a
wistful
face
that
almost
persuaded
me
to
take
him
with
me
on
my
drive
our
drive
had
he
grumbled
i
would
have
felt
less
uncomfortable
but
there
nothing
so
touching
and
overpowering
to
either
gods
or
men
as
the
spectacle
of
mute
resignation
at
last
to
my
great
relief
he
opened
his
mouth
uncle
harry
said
he
do
you
folks

the
little

plenty
of
other
little
to
play
with
so
they
ca
very
well

i
do
they
could
make
me
happy
when
i
wanted
to
see
my
papa
an
mamma
when
i
have
got
anybody
to
play
with
then
i
want
papa

bad
so
bad
as
if
i
would
die
if
i
did
see
right

shaving
and
only
but
i
hastily
wiped
off
my
face
dropped
into
a
took
the
forlorn
little
boy
into
my
arms
and
kissed
him
caressed
him
sympathized
with
him
and
devoted
myself
entirely
to
the
task
and
pleasure
of
comforting
him
his
sober
little
face
gradually
assumed
a
happier
appearance
his
lips
parted
in
such
lines
as
no
old
master
ever
put
upon
angel
lips
his
eyes
from
being
dim
and
hopeless
grew
warm
and
lustrous
and
melting
at
last
he
said
uncle
harry
i
ever
so
happy
now
an
ca
mike

the
time

marbles
oh
yes
an
a
new
dog
anxious
as
i
was
to
hurry
off
to
meet
my
engagement
i
was
rather
disgusted
as
i
unseated
budge
and
returned
to
my
razor
so
long
as
he
was
lonesome
and
i
was
his
only
hope
words
could
express
his
devotion
but
the
moment
he
had
through
my
efforts
regained
his
spirits
his
only
use
for
me
was
to
ask
further
favors
yet
in
trying
the
poor
boy
judicially
the
evidence
was
more
dangerous
to
humanity
in
general
than
to
budge
it
threw
a
great
deal
of
light
upon
my
own
peculiar
theological
puzzles
and
almost
convinced
me
that
my
duty
was
to
preach
a
new
gospel
as
i
drove
up
to
the
steps
of
clarkson
it
seemed
to
me
a
month
had
elapsed
since
last
i
was
there
and
this
apparent
lapse
of
time
was
all
that
prevented
my
ascribing
to
miraculous
agencies
the
wonderful
and
delightful
change
that
alice
countenance
had
undergone
in
two
short
days
composure
quickness
of
perception
the
ability
to
guard
one
self
are
indications
of
character
which
are
particularly
in
place
in
the
countenance
of
a
young
lady
in
society
but
when
without
losing
these
the
face
takes
on
the
radiance
born
of
love
and
trust
the
effect
is
indescribably
charming
especially
to
the
eyes
of
the
man
who
causes
the
change
longer
more
roads
between
hillcrest
and
the
falls
i
venture
to
say
were
never
known
than
i
drove
over
that
afternoon
and
my
happy
companion
who
in
other
days
i
had
imagined
might
one
day
by
her
decision
alertness
and
force
exceed
the
exploits
of
lady
baker
or
miss
tinne
never
once
asked
if
i
was
sure
we
were
on
the
right
road
only
a
single
cloud
came
over
her
brow
and
of
this
i
soon
learned
the
cause
harry
said
she
pressing
closer
to
my
side
and
taking
an
appealing
tone
do
you
love
me
well
enough
to
endure
something
unpleasant
for
my
sake
my
answer
was
not
verbally
expressed
but
its
purport
seemed
to
be
understood
and
accepted
for
alice
continued
i
would
undo
a
bit
of
what
happened
i
the
happiest
proudest
woman
in
the
world
but
we
have
been
very
hasty
for
people
who
have
been
mere
acquaintances
and
mother
is
dreadfully
opposed
to
such
affairs
she
is
of
the
old
style
you
know
it
was
all
my
fault
said
i
i
apologize
promptly
and
handsomely
the
time
and
agony
which
i
did
consume
in
laying
siege
to
your
heart
i
devote
to
the
task
of
gaining
your
mother
good
graces
the
look
i
received
in
reply
to
this
remark
would
have
richly
repaid
me
had
my
task
been
to
conciliate
as
many
as
brigham
young
possesses
but
her
smile
faded
as
she
said
you
do
know
what
a
task
you
have
before
you
mother
has
a
very
tender
heart
but
it
thoroughly
fenced
in
by
proprieties
in
her
day
and
set
courtship
was
a
very
slow
stately
affair
and
mother
believes
it
the
proper
way
now
so
do
i
but
i
admit
possible
exceptions
and
mother
does
i
afraid
she
wo
be
patient
if
she
knows
the
whole
truth
yet
i
ca
bear
to
keep
it
from
her
i
her
only
child
you
know
do
keep
it
from
her
said
i
unless
for
some
reason
of
your
own
let
me
tell
the
whole
story
take
all
the
responsibility
and
accept
the
penalties
if
there
are
any
your
mother
is
right
in
principle
if
there
is
a
certain
delightful
exception
that
we
know
of
my
only
fear
is
for
you
said
my
darling
nestling
closer
to
me
she
comes
of
a
family
that
can
display
most
glorious
indignation
when
there
a
good
excuse
for
it
and
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
you
being
the
cause
of
such
an
outbreak
i
faced
the
ugliest
of
guns
in
honor
of
one
form
of
love
little
girl
i
replied
and
i
could
do
even
more
for
the
sentiment
for
which
you
to
blame
and
for
my
own
sake
i
rather
endure
anything
than
a
sense
of
having
deceived
any
one
especially
the
mother
of
such
a
daughter
besides
you
her
dearest
treasure
and
she
has
a
right
to
know
of
even
the
least
thing
that
in
any
way
concerns
you
and
you
a
noble
fellow
and
whatever
other
sentiment
my
companion
failed
to
put
into
words
was
impulsively
and
eloquently
communicated
by
her
dear
eyes
but
oh
what
a
cowardly
heart
your
dear
cheek
rested
upon
an
instant
later
fair
alice
not
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
did
i
shrink
and
tremble
at
the
realization
of
what
duty
imperatively
required
not
for
the
first
time
did
i
go
through
a
harder
battle
than
was
ever
fought
with
sword
and
cannon
and
a
battle
with
greater
possibilities
of
danger
than
the
field
ever
offered
i
won
it
as
a
man
must
do
in
such
fights
if
he
deserves
to
live
but
i
could
not
help
feeling
considerably
sobered
on
our
homeward
drive
we
neared
the
house
and
i
had
an
insane
fancy
that
instead
of
driving
two
horses
i
was
astride
of
one
with
spurs
at
my
heels
and
a
saber
at
my
side
let
me
talk
to
her
now
alice
wo
you
delays
are
only
cowardly
a
slight
trembling
at
my
side
an
instant
of
silence
that
seemed
an
hour
yet
within
which
i
could
count
but
six
footfalls
and
alice
replied
yes
if
the
parlor
happens
to
be
empty
i
ask
her
if
she
wo
go
in
and
see
you
a
moment
then
there
came
a
look
full
of
tenderness
wonder
painful
solicitude
and
then
two
dear
eyes
filled
with
tears
we
nearly
there
darling
said
i
with
a
reassuring
embrace
yes
and
you
be
the
only
hero
said
she
straightening
herself
proudly
and
looking
a
fit
model
for
a
cenobia
as
we
passed
from
behind
a
clump
of
evergreens
which
hid
the
house
from
our
view
i
involuntarily
exclaimed
gracious
upon
the
piazza
stood
mayton
at
her
side
stood
my
two
nephews
as
dirty
in
face
in
clothing
as
i
had
ever
seen
them
i
do
know
but
that
for
a
moment
i
freely
forgave
them
for
their
presence
might
grant
me
the
respite
which
a
sense
of
duty
would
not
allow
me
to
take
wezhe
comed
up
to
wide
home
wif
you
exclaimed
toddie
as
mayton
greeted
me
with
an
odd
mixture
of
courtesy
curiosity
and
humor
alice
led
the
way
into
the
parlor
whispered
to
her
mother
and
commenced
to
make
a
rapid
exit
when
mayton
called
her
back
and
motioned
her
to
a
chair
alice
and
i
exchanged
sidelong
glances
alice
says
you
wish
to
speak
with
me
burton
said
she
i
wonder
whether
the
subject
is
one
upon
which
i
have
this
afternoon
received
a
minute
verbal
account
from
the
elder
master
lawrence
if
you
refer
to
an
apparently
unwarrantable
intrusion
upon
your
family
circle
i
do
sir
replied
the
old
lady
between
the
statements
made
by
that
child
and
the
hitherto
unaccountable
change
in
my
daughter
looks
during
two
or
three
days
i
think
i
have
got
at
the
truth
of
the
matter
if
the
offender
were
any
one
else
i
should
be
inclined
to
be
severe
but
we
mothers
of
only
daughters
are
apt
to
have
a
pretty
distinct
idea
of
the
merits
of
young
men
and
the
old
lady
dropped
her
head
i
sprang
to
my
feet
seized
her
hand
and
reverently
kissed
it
then
mayton
whose
only
son
had
died
fifteen
years
before
raised
her
head
and
adopted
me
in
the
manner
peculiar
to
mothers
while
alice
burst
into
tears
and
kissed
us
both
a
few
moments
later
as
three
happy
people
were
occupying
conventional
attitudes
and
trying
to
compose
faces
which
should
bear
the
inspection
of
whoever
might
happen
into
the
parlor
mayton
observed
my
children
between
us
this
matter
is
understood
but
i
must
caution
you
against
acting
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
the
engagement
public
at
once
trust
me
for
that
hastily
exclaimed
alice
and
me
said
i
i
have
no
doubt
of
the
intentions
and
discretion
of
either
of
you
resumed
mayton
but
you
can
not
possibly
be
too
cautious
here
a
loud
laugh
from
the
shrubbery
under
the
windows
drowned
voice
for
a
moment
but
she
continued
servants
children
here
she
smiled
and
i
dropped
my
head
persons
you
may
chance
to
meet
again
the
laugh
broke
forth
under
the
window
what
can
those
girls
be
laughing
at
exclaimed
alice
moving
toward
the
window
followed
by
her
mother
and
me
seated
in
a
semicircle
on
the
grass
were
most
of
the
ladies
boarding
at
clarkson
and
in
front
of
them
stood
toddie
in
that
high
state
of
excitement
to
which
sympathetic
applause
always
raises
him
say
it
again
said
one
of
the
ladies
toddie
put
on
an
expression
of
profound
wisdom
made
violent
gestures
with
both
hands
and
repeated
the
following
with
frequent
gesticulations

glances
my

readers
will
understand
just
how
and
i
assure
gentlemen
that
i
did
not
find
their
glances
at
all
hard
to
read
alice
looked
at
me
inquiringly
and
she
now
tells
me
that
i
blushed
sheepishly
and
guiltily
poor
mayton
staggered
to
a
chair
and
exclaimed
too
late
too
late
considering
their
recent
achievements
toddie
and
budge
were
a
very
modest
couple
as
i
drove
them
home
that
evening
budge
even
made
some
attempt
at
apologizing
for
their
appearance
saying
that
they
find
maggie
and
could
wait
any
longer
but
i
assured
him
that
no
apology
was
necessary
i
was
in
such
excellent
spirits
that
my
feeling
became
contagious
and
we
sang
songs
told
stories
and
played
ridiculous
games
most
of
the
evening
paying
but
little
attention
to
the
dinner
that
was
set
for
us
uncle
harry
said
budge
suddenly
do
you
know
we
have
ever
sung
old
pharaoh
army
hallelujah
since
you
been
here
let
do
it
now
all
right
old
fellow
i
knew
the
song
such
as
there
was
of
it
and
its
chorus
as
every
one
does
who
ever
heard
the
jubilee
singers
render
it
but
i
scarcely
understood
the
meaning
of
the
preparations
which
budge
made
he
drew
a
large
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
exclaimed
there
uncle
harry
you
sit
down
come
along
tod
you
sit
on
that
knee
and
i
sit
on
this
lift
up
both
hands
tod
like
i
do
now
we
all
ready
uncle
harry
i
sang
the
first
line
when
israel
was
in
bondage
they
cried
unto
de
lord
without
any
assistance
but
the
boys
came
in
powerfully
on
the
refrain
beating
time
simultaneously
with
their
four
fists
upon
my
chest
i
can
not
think
it
strange
that
i
suddenly
ceased
singing
but
the
boys
viewed
my
action
from
a
different
standpoint
what
makes
you
stop
uncle
harry
asked
budge
because
you
hurt
me
badly
my
boy
you
must
do
that
again
why
i
guess
you
ai
very
strong
that
the
way
we
do
to
papa
it
do
hurt
him
poor
tom
no
wonder
he
grows
flat
chested
guesh
you
a
ky
baby
suggested
toddie
this
imputation
i
bore
with
meekness
but
ventured
to
remark
that
it
was
after
allowing
a
few
moments
for
the
usual
expressions
of
dissent
i
staggered
up
stairs
with
toddie
in
my
arms
and
budge
on
my
back
both
boys
roaring
in
refrain
of
the
negro
hymn
i
a
rolling
through
an
unfriendly
world
the
offer
of
a
stick
of
candy
to
whichever
boy
was
first
undressed
caused
some
lively
disrobing
after
which
each
boy
received
the
prize
budge
bit
a
large
piece
wedged
it
between
his
cheek
and
his
teeth
closed
his
eyes
folded
his
hands
on
his
breast
and
prayed
dear
lord
bless
papa
an
mamma
an
toddie
an
me
an
that
turtle
uncle
harry
found
and
bless
that
lovely
lady
uncle
harry
goes
riding
with
an
make
take
me
too
an
bless
that
nice
old
lady
with
white
hair
that
cried
and
said
i
was
a
smart
boy
amen
toddie
sighed
as
he
drew
his
stick
of
candy
from
his
lips
then
he
shut
his
eyes
and
remarked
dee
lord
blesh
toddie
an
make
him
good
boy
an
blesh
zem
ladies
zat
told
me
to
say
it
aden
the
particular
it
referred
to
being
well
understood
by
at
least
three
adults
of
my
acquaintances
the
course
of
budge
interview
with
mayton
was
afterward
related
by
that
lady
as
follows
she
was
sitting
in
her
own
room
which
was
on
the
and
in
the
rear
of
the
house
and
was
leisurely
reading
fated
to
be
free
when
she
accidentally
dropped
her
glasses
stooping
to
pick
them
up
she
became
aware
that
she
was
not
alone
a
small
very
dirty
but
boy
stood
before
her
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
an
inquiring
look
in
his
eyes
run
away
little
boy
said
she
do
you
know
it
is
polite
to
enter
rooms
without
knocking
i
lookin
for
my
uncle
said
budge
in
most
melodious
accents
the
other
ladies
said
you
would
know
when
he
would
come
back
i
afraid
they
were
making
fun
of
you
or
me
said
the
old
lady
a
little
severely
i
do
know
anything
about
little
boys
uncles
now
run
away
and
do
disturb
me
any
more
well
continued
budge
they
said
your
little
girl
went
with
him
and
you
know
when
she
would
come
back
i
have
any
little
girl
said
the
old
lady
her
indignation
at
a
supposed
joke
threatening
to
overcome
her
dignity
now
go
away
she
is
a
very
little
girl
said
budge
honestly
anxious
to
conciliate
that
is
she
am
but
they
said
you
was
her
mother
an
so
she
you
little
girl
is
she
think
lovely
too
do
you
mean
miss
mayton
asked
the
lady
thinking
she
had
a
possible
clue
to
the
cause
of
budge
anxiety
oh
yes
that
her
name
i
could
think
of
it
eagerly
replied
budge
an
ai
she
awful
nice
know
she
is
your
judgment
is
quite
correct
considering
your
age
said
mayton
exhibiting
more
interest
in
budge
than
she
had
heretofore
done
but
what
makes
you
think
she
is
nice
you
are
rather
younger
than
her
male
admirers
usually
are
why
my
uncle
harry
told
me
so
replied
budge
an
he
knows
everything
mayton
grew
vigilant
at
once
and
dropped
her
book
who

your
uncle
harry
little
boy
he
uncle
harry
do

know
him

the
lady

thought

mayton

her
brows
for
a
moment
and
finally

remarked
the
lady
with

said

breath
and

a
moment

last
she
said
how

gives

for
mayton

her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
two
or
three
moments
later
she
felt
a
light
touch
on
her
knee
and
wiping
her
eyes
saw
budge
looking
sympathetically
into
her
face
i
awful
sorry
you
feel
bad
said
he
are
you
to
have
your
little
girl
ridin
so
long
yes
exclaimed
mayton
with
great
decision
well
you
need
be
said
budge
for
uncle
harry
awful
careful
an
smart
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
exclaimed
the
lady
i
guess
he
is
then
said
budge
cos
he
he
ought
to
be
he
awful
careful
day
when
the
goat
ran
away
an
toddie
me
got
in
the
carriage
with
them
he
held
on
to
her
tight
so
she
could
fall
out
mayton
brought
her
foot
down
with
a
violent
stamp
i
know
you
him
if
you
knew
how
nice
he
was
continued
budge
he
sings
awful
funny
songs
an
tells
splendid
stories
nonsense
exclaimed
the
angry
mother
they
ai
no
nonsense
at
all
said
budge
i
do
think
it
nice
for
to
say
that
when
his
stories
are
always
about
joseph
an
abraham
an
moses
an
when
jesus
was
a
little
boy
an
the
hebrew
children
an
lots
of
people
that
the
lord
loved
an
he
awful
too
yes
i
suppose
so
said
mayton
when
we
says
our
prayers
we
prays
for
the
nice
lady
what
he
an
he
likes
us
to
do
it
continued
budge
how
do
you
know
demanded
mayton
cos
he
always
kisses
us
when
we
do
it
an
that
what
my
papa
does
when
he
likes
what
we
pray
mayton
mind
became
absorbed
in
earnest
thought
but
budge
had
not
said
all
that
was
in
his
heart
an
when
toddie
or
me
tumbles
down
an
hurts
ourselves
no
matter
what
uncle
harry
doin
he
runs
right
out
an
picks
us
up
comforts
us
he
froed
away
a
cigar
the
other
day
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
when
a
wasp
stung
me
an
toddie
picked
the
cigar
up
and
ate
it
an
it
made
him
awful
sick
the
incident
did
not
affect
mayton
deeply
perhaps
on
the
score
of
inapplicability
to
the
question
before
her
budge
went
on
an
was
he
good
to
me
today
just
cos
i
was
forlorn
cos
i
nobody
to
play
with
an
wanted
to
die
an
go
to
heaven
he
stopped
shavin
so
as
to
comfort
me
mayton
had
been
thinking
rapidly
and
seriously
and
her
heart
had
relented
somewhat
toward
the
principal
offender
suppose
said
she
that
i
do
let
my
little
girl
go
riding
with
him
any
more
then
said
budge
i
know
he
be
awful
awful
unhappy
an
i
be
awful
sorry
for
him
cos
nice
folks
ought
to
be
made
unhappy
suppose
then
that
i
do
let
her
go
said
mayton
then
i
give
you
a
whole
stomachful
of
kisses
for
being
so
good
to
my
uncle
said
budge
and
assuming
that
the
latter
course
would
be
the
one
adopted
by
mayton
budge
climbed
into
her
lap
and
began
at
once
to
make
payment
bless
your
dear
little
heart
exclaimed
mayton
you
of
the
same
blood
and
it
is
good
if
it
is
rather
hasty
as
i
arose
the
next
morning
i
found
a
letter
under
my
door
disappointed
that
it
was
not
addressed
in
alice
writing
i
was
nevertheless
glad
to
get
a
word
from
my
sister
particularly
as
the
letter
ran
as
follows
july
dear
old
brother
i
been
recalling
a
fortnight
experience

once
had
of
courtship
in
a
and
i
determined
to
cut
short
our
visit
here
hurry
home
and
give
you
and
alice
a
chance
or
two
to
see
each
other
in
parlors
where
there
wo
be
a
likelihood
of
the
dozen
or
two
interruptions
you
must
suffer
each
evening
now
tom
agrees
with
me
like
the
obedient
old

with
us
lovingly
your
sister
helen
of
course

my

toddie

your

mamma
budge
looked
like
an
angel
in
an
instant
but
toddie
eyes
twitched
a
little
and
he
mournfully
murmured
i
fought
it
wash
an
o
uncle
harry
said
budge
springing
out
of
bed
in
a
perfect
delirium
of
delight
i
believe
if
my
papa
an
mamma
had
stayed
away
any
longer
i
believe
i
would
die
i
been
so
lonesome
for
that
i
known
what
to
do
i
cried
whole
pillowsful
about

right
here
in

dark
why

uncle
harry

let
him
try
to
comfort
you
i
could
said
budge
when
i
gets
lonesome
it
feels
as
if
my
mouth
was
all
tied
up
an
a
great
big
stone
was
right
in
here
and
budge
put
his

izhe
toddie
yawncie
toddie
made
none
the
less
haste
in
dressing
than
his
brother
however
candy
was
to
him
what
some
systems
of
theology
are
to
their
adherents
not
a
very
lofty
motive
of
action
but
sweet
and
something
he
could
fully
understand
so
the
energy
displayed
in
getting
himself
tangled
up
in
his
clothes
was
something
wonderful
stop
boys
said
i

the

toddie

said
i
a
look
of
inquiry
was
speedily
followed
by
toddie
own
unmistakable
preparations
for
weeping
and
as
i
did
not
want
his
eyes
dimmed
when
his
mother
looked
into
them
i
hastily
exclaimed
put
them
on
then

the
mantle
of
rude
boreas
if
you

then
let
me
drive
down
to
the
depot
just
to
show
papa
an
mamma
i

a
i

mamma

be
very
unhappy
when
she
found
out
i

one
and
she
had
seen
it
first
thing

i

this
morning

i
guess
the
sun
be
disappointed
if
it

have
us
to
look
at
suggested
budge
never
mind
said
i
the
sun
old
enough
to
have
learned
to
be
patient
breakfast
over
the
boys
moved
reluctantly
away
to
the
while
i
inspected
the
house
and
grounds
pretty
closely
to
see
that
everything
should
at
least
fail
to
do
my
management
discredit
a
dollar
given
to
mike
and
another
to
maggie
were
of
material
assistance
in
this
work
so
i
felt
free
to
adorn
the
parlors
and
helen
chamber
with
flowers
as
i
went
into
the
latter
room
i
heard
some
one
at
the
which
was
in
the
alcove
and
on
looking
i
saw
toddie
drinking
the
last
of
the
contents
of
a
goblet
which
contained
a
mixture
ize
takin
black
medshin
said
toddie
i
likes
black
medshin
awfoo
muts
what
do
you
make
it
of
i
asked
with
some
sympathy
and
tracing
parental
influence
again
when
helen
and
i
were
children
we
spent
hours
in
soaking
liquorice
in
water
and
administering
it
as
medicine
makesh
it
out
of
shoda
mitsture
said
toddie
this
was
another
medicine
of
our
childhood
days
but
one
prepared
according
to
physician
prescription
and
not
beneficial
when
taken
ad
libitum
as
i
took
the
vial
a
one
i
asked
how
much
did
you
take
toddie
took
whole
bottoo
full
twas
nysh
said
he
suddenly
the
label
caught
my
eye
it
read
paregoric
in
a
second
i
had
snatched
a
shawl
wrapped
toddie
in
it
tucked
him
under
my
arm
and
was
on
my
way
to
the
barn
in
a
moment
more
i
was
on
one
of
the
horses
and
galloping
furiously
to
the
village
with
toddie
under
one
arm
his
yellow
curls
streaming
in
the
breeze
people
came
out
and
stared
as
they
did
at
john
gilpin
while
one
old
farmer
whom
i
met
turned
his
team
about
whipped
up
furiously
and
followed
me
shouting
stop
thief
i
afterward
learned
that
he
took
me
to
be
one
of
the
abductors
of
charley
ross
with
the
lost
child
under
my
arm
and
that
visions
of
the
reward
floated
before
his
eyes
in
front
of
an
i
brought
the
horse
suddenly
upon
his
haunches
and
dashed
in
exclaiming
give
this
child
a
strong
emetic
quick
he
swallowed
poison
the
apothecary
hurried
to
his
while
a
irish
woman
upon
whom
he
had
been
waiting
exclaimed
holy
mither
i
run
an
fetch
father
and
hurried
out
meanwhile
toddie
upon
whom
the
medicine
had
not
commenced
to
take
effect
had
seized
the
apothecary
cat
by
the
tail
which
operation
resulted
in
a
considerable
vocal
protest
from
that
animal
the
experiences
of
the
next
few
moments
were
more
pronounced
and
revolutionary
than
pleasing
to
relate
in
detail
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
toddie
weight
was
materially
diminished
and
that
his
complexion
was
temporarily
pallid
father
arrived
at
a
brisk
run
and
was
honestly
glad
to
find
that
his
services
were
not
required
although
i
assured
him
that
if
catholic
baptism
and
a
sprinkling
of
holy
water
would
improve
toddie
character
i
thought
there
was
excuse
for
several
applications
we
rode
quietly
back
to
the
house
and
while
i
was
asking
maggie
to
try
to
coax
toddie
into
taking
a
nap
i
heard
the
patient
remark
to
his
brother
budgie
down
to
the
village
i
was
a
i
did
froe
up
djonah
but
i
froed
up
a
whole
floor
full
of
uvver
fings
during
the
hour
which
passed
before
it
was
time
to
start
for
the
depot
my
sole
attention
was
devoted
to
keeping
the
children
from
soiling
their
clothes
but
my
success
was
so
little
that
i
lost
my
temper
entirely
first
they
insisted
upon
playing
on
a
part
of
the
lawn
which
the
sun
had
not
yet
reached
then
while
i
had
gone
into
the
house
for
a
match
to
light
my
cigar
toddie
had
gone
with
his
damp
shoes
into
the
middle
of
the
road
where
the
dust
was
ankle
deep
then
they
got
upon
their
hands
and
knees
on
the
piazza
and
played
bear
each
one
wanted
to
pick
a
bouquet
for
his
mother
and
toddie
took
the
precaution
to
smell
every
flower
he
approached
an
operation
which
caused
him
to
get
his
nose
covered
with
so
that
he
looked
like
a
badly
used
in
one
of
their
spasms
of
inaction
budge
asked
what
makes
some
of
the
men
in
church
have
no
hair
on
the
tops
of
their
heads
uncle
harry
because
said
i
pausing
long
enough
to
shake
toddie
for
trying
to
get
my
watch
out
of
my
pocket
because
they
have
bad
little
boys
to
bother
them
all
the
time
so
their
hair
drops
out
i
dess
my
hairs
is
to
drop
out
pitty
soon
then
remarked
toddie
with
an
injured
air
harness
the
horses
mike
i
shouted
an
the
goat
too
added
budge
five
minutes
later
i
was
seated
in
the
carriage
or
rather
in
open
wagon
mike
i
shouted
i
forgot
to
tell
maggie
to
have
some
lunch
ready
for
the
folks
when
they
get
here
run
tell
her
quick
wo
you
oye
oye
sur
said
mike
and
off
he
went
are
you
all
ready
boys
i
asked
in
a
minute
said
budge
soon
as
i
fix
this
now
he
continued
getting
into
his
seat
and
taking
the
reins
and
whip
go
ahead
wait
a
moment
budge
put
down
that
whip
and
do
touch
the
goat
with
it
once
on
the
way
i
going
to
drive
very
slowly
there
plenty
of
time
and
all
you
need
to
do
is
to
hold
your
reins
all
right
said
budge
but
i
like
to
look
like
mans
when
i
drive
you
may
do
that
when
somebody
can
run
beside
you
now
the
horses
started
at
a
gentle
trot
and
the
goat
followed
very
closely
when
within
a
minute
of
the
depot
however
the
train
swept
in
i
had
intended
to
be
on
the
platform
to
meet
tom
and
helen
but
my
watch
was
evidently
slow
i
gave
the
horses
the
whip
looked
behind
and
saw
the
boys
were
close
upon
me
and
i
was
so
near
the
platform
when
i
turned
my
head
that
nothing
but
the
sharpest
of
turns
saved
me
from
a
severe
accident
the
noble
animals
saw
the
danger
as
quickly
as
i
did
however
and
turned
in
marvelously
small
space
as
they
did
so
i
heard
two
hard
thumps
upon
the
wooden
wall
of
the
little
depot
heard
also
two
frightful
howls
saw
both
my
nephews
considerably
mixed
up
on
the
platform
while
the
driver
of
the
stage
growled
in
my
ear
what
in
thunder
did
you
let
hitch
that
goat
to
your
for
i
looked
and
saw
the
man
spoke
with
just
cause
how
the
goat
head
and
shoulders
had
maintained
their
normal
connection
during
the
last
minute
of
my
drive
i
leave
for
naturalists
to
explain
i
had
no
time
to
meditate
on
the
matter
just
then
for
the
train
had
stopped
fortunately
the
children
had
struck
on
their
heads
and
the
skull
is
a
marvel
of
solidity
i
set
them
upon
their
feet
brushed
them
off
with
my
hands
promised
them
all
the
candy
they
could
eat
for
a
week
wiped
their
eyes
and
hurried
them
to
the
other
side
of
the
depot
budge
rushed
at
tom
exclaiming
see
my
goat
papa
helen
opened
her
arms
and
toddie
threw
himself
into
them
sobbing
mam
ma
shing
how
uncomfortable
a
man
can
feel
in
the
society
of
a
sister
and
an
incomparable
i
never
imagined
until
that
short
drive
helen
was
somewhat
concerned
about
the
children
but
she
found
time
to
look
at
me
with
so
much
of
sympathy
humor
affection
and
condescension
that
i
really
felt
relieved
when
we
reached
the
house
i
hastily
retired
to
my
own
room
but
before
i
had
shut
the
door
helen
was
with
me
and
her
arms
were
about
my
neck
before
the
dear
old
girl
removed
them
we
had
grown
far
nearer
to
each
other
than
we
had
ever
been
before
and
how
gloriously
the
rest
of
the
day
passed
off
we
had
a
delightful
little
lunch
and
tom
brought
up
a
bottle
of
roederer
and
helen
remonstrate
when
he
insisted
on
its
being
drank
from
her
finest
glasses
and
there
were
toasts
drank
to
her
and
her
mother
and
to
the
benedict
that
was
to
be
and
then
helen
proposed
the
makers
of
the
match
budge
and
toddie
which
was
honored
with
bumpers
the
gentlemen
toasted
did
not
respond
but
they
stared
so
curiously
that
i
sprang
from
my
chair
and
kissed
them
soundly
upon
which
tom
and
helen
exchanged
significant
glances
then
helen
walked
down
to
clarkson
all
for
the
purpose
of
showing
a
lady
there
with
a
skirt
to
make
over
just
how
she
had
seen
a
similar
garment
rearranged
exquisitely
and
alice
strolled
down
to
the
gate
with
her
to
say
and
they
had
so
much
to
talk
about
that
helen
walked
alice
nearly
to
our
house
and
then
insisted
on
her
coming
the
rest
of
the
way
so
she
might
be
driven
home
and
then
mike
was
sent
back
with
a
note
to
say
to
mayton
that
her
daughter
had
been
prevailed
upon
to
stay
to
evening
dinner
but
would
be
sent
home
under
capable
escort
and
after
dinner
was
over
and
the
children
put
to
bed
tom
groaned
that
he
must
attend
a
meeting
and
helen
begged
us
to
excuse
her
just
a
minute
while
she
ran
into
the
doctor
to
ask
how
poor
brown
had
been
doing
and
she
consumed
three
hours
and
minutes
in
asking
bless
her
sympathetic
soul
the
dreaded
ending
of
my
vacation
did
not
cause
me
as
many
pangs
as
i
had
expected
helen
wanted
to
know
one
evening
why
if
her
poor
dear
tom
could
go
back
and
forth
to
the
city
to
business
every
day
her
lazy
big
brother
could
go
back
and
forth
to
hillcrest
daily
if
she
were
to
want
him
as
a
boarder
for
the
remainder
of
the
season
although
i
had
for
years
inveighed
against
the
folly
of
cultivated
people
leaving
the
city
to
find
residences
helen
argument
was
unanswerable
and
i
submitted
i
did
even
more
i
purchased
a
lovely
bit
of
ground
though
the
deed
stands
in
tom
name
for
the
present
and
tom
has
brought
up
several
plans
of
and
every
evening
they
are
spread
on
the
table
and
there
gather
round
them
four
people
among
whom
are
a
salesman
and
a
young
lady
with
the
brightest
of
eyes
and
cheeks
full
of
roses
and
lilies
this
personage
has
her
own
opinions
of
the
merits
of
all
plans
suggested
and
insisted
that
whatever
plan
is
adopted
must
have
a
lovely
room
to
be
set
apart
as
the
exclusive
property
of
helen
boys
young
as
these
gentlemen
are
i
find
frequent
occasions
to
be
frightfully
jealous
of
them
but
they
are
unmoved
by
either
my
frowns
or
persuasions
artifice
alone
is
able
to
prevent
their
monopolizing
the
time
of
an
adorable
being
of
whose
society
i
can
not
possibly
have
too
much
she
insists
that
when
the
ceremony
takes
place
in
december
they
shall
officiate
as
groomsmen
and
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
she
will
carry
her
point
in
fact
i
confess
to
frequent
affectionate
advances
toward
them
myself
and
when
i
retire
without
first
seeking
their
room
and
putting
a
grateful
kiss
upon
their
unconscious
lips
my
conscience
upbraids
me
with
base
ingratitude
to
think
i
might
yet
be
a
hopeless
bachelor
had
it
not
been
for
them
is
to
overflow
with
thankfulness
to
the
giver
of
helen
babies
the
end
