perrault
must
have
been
as
charming
a
fellow
as
a
man
could
meet
he
was
one
of
the
personages
of
his
own
great
age
and
he
has
remained
ever
since
a
prime
favourite
of
mankind
we
are
fortunate
in
knowing
a
great
deal
about
his
varied
life
deriving
our
knowledge
mainly
from
history
of
the
french
academy
and
from
his
own
memoirs
which
were
written
for
his
grandchildren
but
not
published
till
years
after
his
death
we
should
i
think
be
more
fortunate
still
if
the
memoirs
had
not
ceased
in
or
if
their
author
had
permitted
himself
to
write
of
his
family
affairs
without
reserve
or
restraint
in
the
approved
manner
of
modern
autobiography
we
should
like
for
example
to
know
much
more
than
we
do
about
the
wife
and
the
two
sons
to
whom
he
was
so
was
born
in
paris
in
the
fifth
son
of
pierre
perrault
a
prosperous
parliamentary
lawyer
and
at
the
age
of
nine
was
sent
to
a
the
collège
de
beauvais
his
father
helped
him
with
his
lessons
at
home
as
he
himself
later
on
was
accustomed
to
help
his
own
children
he
can
never
have
been
a
model
schoolboy
though
he
was
always
first
in
his
class
and
he
ended
his
school
career
prematurely
by
quarrelling
with
his
master
and
bidding
him
a
formal
cause
of
this
quarrel
throws
a
bright
light
on
perraults
subsequent
career
he
refused
to
accept
his
teacher
philosophical
tenets
on
the
mere
ground
of
their
traditional
authority
he
claimed
that
novelty
was
in
itself
a
merit
and
on
this
they
parted
he
did
not
go
alone
one
of
his
friends
a
boy
called
beaurain
espoused
his
cause
and
for
the
next
three
or
four
years
the
two
read
together
haphazard
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
this
plan
of
study
had
almost
certainly
a
bad
effect
on
beaurain
for
we
hear
no
more
of
him
it
certainly
prevented
perrault
from
being
a
thorough
scholar
though
it
made
him
a
man
of
taste
a
sincere
independent
and
an
undaunted
he
took
his
degree
at
the
university
of
orléans
where
degrees
were
given
with
scandalous
readiness
payment
of
fees
being
the
only
essential
preliminary
in
the
he
had
walked
the
hospitals
with
some
vague
notion
of
following
his
brother
claude
into
the
profession
of
medicine
and
had
played
a
small
part
as
a
theological
controversialist
in
the
quarrel
then
raging
about
the
nature
of
grace
between
the
jesuits
and
the
jansenists
having
abandoned
medicine
and
theology
he
got
called
to
the
bar
practised
for
a
while
with
distinct
success
and
coquetted
with
a
notion
of
codifying
the
laws
of
the
realm
the
bar
proved
too
arid
a
profession
to
engage
for
long
his
attention
so
he
next
sought
and
found
a
place
in
the
office
of
another
brother
pierre
who
was
chief
commissioner
of
taxes
in
paris
here
perrault
had
little
to
do
save
to
read
at
large
in
the
excellent
library
which
his
brother
had
want
of
further
occupation
he
returned
to
the
writing
of
verse
one
of
the
chief
pleasures
of
his
boyhood
his
first
sustained
literary
effort
had
been
a
parody
of
the
sixth
book
of
the
æneid
which
perhaps
fortunately
for
his
reputation
was
never
published
and
has
not
survived
beaurain
and
his
brother
nicholas
a
doctor
of
the
sorbonne
assisted
him
in
this
perpetration
and
claude
made
the
sketches
with
which
it
was
illustrated
in
the
few
years
that
had
elapsed
since
the
writing
of
this
burlesque
perrault
had
acquired
more
sense
and
taste
and
his
new
poems
in
particular
the
portrait
and
the
dialogue
entre
et
were
found
charming
by
his
contemporaries
they
were
issued
anonymously
and
quinault
himself
a
poet
of
established
reputation
used
some
of
them
to
forward
his
suit
with
a
young
lady
allowing
her
to
think
that
they
were
his
own
perrault
when
told
of
quinault
pretensions
deemed
it
necessary
to
disclose
his
authorship
but
on
hearing
of
the
use
to
which
his
work
had
been
put
he
gallantly
remained
in
the
background
forgave
the
fraud
and
made
a
friend
of
the
next
engaged
his
attention
and
in
he
designed
a
house
at
viry
for
his
brother
and
supervised
its
construction
colbert
approved
so
much
of
this
performance
that
he
employed
him
in
the
superintendence
of
the
royal
buildings
and
put
him
in
special
charge
of
versailles
which
was
then
in
process
of
erection
perrault
flung
himself
with
ardour
into
this
work
though
not
to
the
exclusion
of
his
other
activities
he
wrote
odes
in
honour
of
the
king
he
planned
designs
for
gobelin
tapestries
and
decorative
paintings
he
became
a
member
of
the
select
little
academy
of
medals
and
inscriptions
which
colbert
brought
into
being
to
devise
suitable
legends
for
the
royal
palaces
and
monuments
he
encouraged
musicians
and
fought
the
cause
of
lulli
he
joined
with
claude
in
a
successful
effort
to
found
the
academy
of
perrault
had
something
of
his
brother
versatility
and
shared
his
love
for
architecture
and
the
two
now
became
deeply
interested
in
the
various
schemes
which
were
mooted
for
the
completion
of
the
louvre
bernini
was
summoned
by
the
king
from
rome
and
entrusted
with
the
task
but
the
brothers
perrault
intervened
charles
conceived
the
idea
of
the
great
east
front
and
communicated
it
to
claude
who
drew
the
plans
and
was
commissioned
to
carry
them
out
the
work
was
finished
in
and
is
still
popularly
known
as
the
same
year
charles
was
elected
to
the
academy
without
any
personal
canvas
on
his
part
for
the
honour
his
inaugural
address
was
heard
with
such
approval
that
he
ventured
to
suggest
that
the
inauguration
of
future
members
should
be
a
public
function
the
suggestion
was
adopted
and
these
addresses
became
the
most
famous
feature
of
the
academy
proceedings
and
are
so
to
the
present
day
this
was
not
his
only
service
to
the
academy
for
he
carried
a
motion
to
the
effect
that
future
elections
should
be
by
ballot
and
invented
and
provided
at
his
own
expense
a
which
though
he
does
not
describe
it
was
probably
the
model
of
those
in
use
in
all
modern
clubs
and
novelty
of
his
views
did
not
always
commend
them
to
his
brother
those
expressed
in
his
poem
le
siècle
de
louis
xiv
which
he
read
as
an
academician
of
sixteen
years
standing
initiated
one
of
the
most
famous
and
lasting
literary
quarrels
of
the
era
perrault
in
praising
the
writers
of
his
own
age
ventured
to
disparage
some
of
the
great
authors
of
the
ancient
classics
boileau
lashed
himself
into
a
fury
of
opposition
and
hurled
strident
insults
against
the
heretic
racine
more
adroit
pretended
to
think
that
the
poem
was
a
piece
of
ingenious
irony
most
men
of
letters
hastened
to
participate
in
the
battle
no
doubt
perrault
position
was
untenable
but
he
conducted
his
defence
with
perfect
temper
and
much
wit
and
boileau
made
himself
not
a
little
absurd
by
his
violence
and
his
obvious
longing
to
display
the
extent
of
his
learning
perrault
case
is
finally
stated
in
his
four
volumes
le
parallèle
des
anciens
et
des
modernes
which
were
published
in
he
evidently
took
vastly
more
pride
in
this
dull
and
now
almost
forgotten
work
than
in
the
matchless
stories
which
have
made
him
famous
for
twenty
years
in
the
service
of
colbert
the
sun
of
fortunes
passed
its
zenith
his
brother
the
commissioner
of
taxes
had
a
dispute
with
the
minister
and
was
disgraced
then
perrault
got
married
to
a
young
lady
of
whom
we
know
nothing
except
that
her
marriage
was
the
subject
of
some
opposition
from
his
powerful
employer
in
a
matter
of
the
sort
perrault
though
a
courtier
could
be
relied
on
to
consider
no
wishes
save
those
of
his
future
wife
and
himself
colbert
own
influence
with
the
king
became
shaky
and
this
affected
his
temper
so
perrault
then
just
slid
quietly
from
his
service
in
the
year
he
went
he
succeeded
in
frustrating
a
project
for
closing
the
tuileries
gardens
against
the
people
of
paris
and
their
children
colbert
proposed
to
reserve
them
to
the
royal
use
but
perrault
persuaded
him
to
come
there
one
day
for
a
walk
showed
him
the
citizens
taking
the
air
and
playing
with
their
children
got
the
gardeners
to
testify
that
these
privileges
were
never
abused
and
carried
his
point
by
declaring
finally
that
the
king
pleasaunce
was
so
spacious
that
there
was
room
for
all
his
children
to
walk
there
seventy
years
ago
pleaded
that
this
service
to
the
children
of
paris
should
be
commemorated
by
a
statue
of
perrault
in
the
centre
of
the
tuileries
the
statue
has
never
been
erected
and
to
the
present
day
paris
so
plentifully
provided
with
statues
and
pictures
of
the
great
men
of
france
has
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
to
show
that
she
appreciates
the
genius
of
perrault
indeed
there
is
no
statue
of
him
in
existence
and
the
only
painting
of
him
with
which
i
am
acquainted
is
a
doubtful
one
hung
far
away
in
an
obscure
corner
of
the
palace
of
close
of
perrault
official
career
marked
the
beginning
of
his
period
of
greatest
literary
activity
in
he
published
his
long
narrative
poem
saint
paulin
evesque
de
nole
with
a
christian
epistle
upon
penitence
and
an
ode
to
the
which
he
dedicated
to
bossuet
between
the
years
and
appeared
the
parallèle
des
anciens
et
des
modernes
to
which
i
have
already
referred
in
he
brought
out
his
cabinet
des
beaux
arts
beautifully
illustrated
by
engravings
and
containing
a
poem
on
painting
which
even
boileau
condescended
to
admire
in
he
published
his
apologie
des
femmes
he
wrote
two
comedies
in
and
les
fontanges
these
were
not
printed
till
they
added
nothing
to
his
reputation
between
and
were
composed
the
immortal
histoires
ou
contes
du
temps
passé
and
the
contes
en
vers
toward
the
end
of
his
life
he
busied
himself
with
the
éloges
des
hommes
illustres
du
siècle
de
louis
xiv
the
first
of
these
two
stately
volumes
came
out
in
and
the
second
in
they
were
illustrated
by
a
hundred
and
two
excellent
engravings
including
one
by
edelinck
of
perrault
himself
and
another
of
his
brother
claude
these
biographies
are
written
with
kindly
justice
and
form
a
valuable
contribution
to
the
history
of
the
reign
of
the
roi
soleil
i
have
not
exhausted
the
list
of
perrault
writings
but
to
speak
frankly
the
rest
are
not
worth
died
aged
in
deservedly
admired
and
regretted
by
all
who
knew
him
this
was
not
strange
for
he
was
clever
honest
courteous
and
witty
he
did
his
duty
to
his
family
his
employer
his
friends
and
to
the
public
at
large
in
an
age
of
great
men
but
also
of
great
prejudices
he
fought
his
own
way
to
fame
and
fortune
he
served
all
the
arts
and
practised
most
of
them
painters
writers
sculptors
musicians
and
men
of
science
all
gladly
made
him
free
of
their
company
as
a
good
civil
servant
he
was
no
politician
and
he
showed
no
leaning
whatever
toward
what
was
regarded
in
his
time
as
the
greatest
of
all
professions
that
of
arms
these
two
deficiencies
if
deficiencies
they
be
only
endear
him
the
more
to
us
every
one
likes
a
man
who
deserves
to
enjoy
life
and
does
in
fact
enjoy
it
perrault
was
such
a
man
he
was
more
he
was
the
cause
of
enjoyment
to
countless
of
his
fellows
and
his
stories
still
promise
enjoyment
to
countless
others
to
is
amazing
to
remember
that
perrault
was
rather
ashamed
of
his
histoires
ou
contes
du
temps
passé
perhaps
better
known
as
les
contes
de
ma
mère
or
mother
goose
tales
from
the
rough
print
which
was
inserted
as
a
frontispiece
to
the
first
collected
edition
in
he
would
not
even
publish
them
in
his
own
name
they
were
declared
to
be
by
darmancour
perrault
young
son
in
order
that
the
secret
might
be
well
kept
perrault
abandoned
his
usual
publisher
coignard
and
went
to
barbin
the
stories
had
previously
appeared
from
time
to
time
anonymously
in
moetjens
little
magazine
the
recueil
which
was
published
from
the
hague
la

au

was
the

and
in
rapid
succession
followed

was
not
so
shy
in
admitting
the
authorship
of
his
three
verse
stories
griselidis
les
souhaits
ridicules
and

the
first
appeared
anonymously
it
is
true
in
but
when
it
came
to
be
reprinted
with
les

ridicules

in
they
were
entrusted
to
the
firm
of
coignard
and
described
as
being

mr

françoise

had
made
a
fashion
of
this
sort
of
would
not
be
fair
to
assume
that
darmancour
had
no
connection
whatever
with
the
composition
of
the
stories
which
bore
his
name
the
best
of
perrault
critics
paul
de
st
victor
and
andrew
lang
among
others
see
in
the
book
a
marvellous
collaboration
of
crabbed
age
and
youth
the
boy
probably
gathered
the
stories
from
his
nurse
and
brought
them
to
his
father
who
touched
them
up
and
toned
them
down
and
wrote
them
out
paul

in
his
fine
edition
of

as
far
as
to
attribute
the
entire
authorship
of
the
prose
tales
to

he
deferred
however
to
universal
usage
when
he
entitled

none
of
them
has
ever
rivalled
much
less
surpassed
the

the

are
probably
those

crossed
the
channel
and
a
translation
by

printed
for

advertised
in
the

of
mr

was
presumably
one
robert

of

who
translated
other
tales
from

for
edmond
curl
the
bookseller
about
this
time
no
copy
of
the
first
edition
of
his
perrault
is
known
to
exist
yet
it
won
a
wide
popularity
as
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
there
was
a
seventh
edition
published
in
for
rivington
a
bookseller
of
pearl
street
new
english
translation
of
perrault
fairy
tales
has
attained
unquestioned
literary
so
the
publishers
of
the
present
book
have
thought
it
best
to
use
samber
translation
which
has
a
special
interest
of
its
own
in
being
almost
contemporary
with
the
original
the
text
has
been
thoroughly
revised
and
corrected
by
mr
mansion
who
has
purged
it
of
many
errors
without
detracting
from
its
quality
to
mr

also
is
due
the
credit
for
the
translation
of
the
les
souhaits
ridicules
and
for
the
adaptation
of
peau
griselidis
is
excluded
from
this
book
for
two
good
reasons
firstly
because
it
is
an
admitted
borrowing
by
perrault
from
boccaccio
secondly
because
it
is
not
a
tale
in
the
true
sense
of
the
is
perhaps
unnecessary
for
me
to
add
anything
about
mr
illustrations
many
of
the
readers
of
this
book
will
be
already
familiar
with
his
work
besides
i
always
feel
that
it
is
an
impertinence
to
describe
pictures
in
their
presence
mr
clarke
speak
for
themselves
they
speak
for
perrault
too
it
is
seldom
indeed
that
an
illustrator
enters
so
thoroughly
into
the
spirit
of
his
text
the
grace
delicacy
urbanity
tenderness
and
humour
which
went
to
the
making
of
perrault
stories
must
it
seems
have
also
gone
in
somewhat
similar
proportions
to
the
making
of
these
delightful
drawings
i
am
sure
that
they
would
have
given
pleasure
to
perrault

once
upon
a
time
there

met
with

had
a
very
great
mind
to
eat

up
but
he
durst
not
because
of
some
hard
by
in
the
forest
he
asked
her
whither
she
was
going
the
poor
child
who
did
not
know
that
it
was
dangerous
to
stay
and
hear
a
wolf
talk
said

way
and

there
soonest
the
wolf
began
to
run
as
fast
as
he
could
taking
the
nearest
way
and
the
little
girl
went
by
that
farthest
about
diverting
herself
in
gathering
nuts
running
after
butterflies
and
making
nosegays
of
such
little
flowers
as
she
met
with
the
wolf
was
not
long
before
he
got
to
the
old
woman

he
knocked
at
the
door
who
there

counterfeiting
her
voice
who
has
brought
you
a
and
a
little

by
mamma
the

who
was
in

the
wolf
pull
the
peg
and
the
door
opened
and
then
presently
he
fell
upon
the
good
woman
and
ate
her
up
in
a
moment
for
it
was
above
three
days
that
he
had
not
touched
a
bit
he
then
shut
the
door
and
went
into
the
bed
expecting
little
red
who
came
some
time
afterwards
and
knock
at
the
door
who
there
illustration
he
asked
her
whither
she
was
going
little
red
hearing
the
big
voice
of
the
wolf
was
at
first
afraid
but
believing
her
had
got
a
cold
and
was
hoarse
answered
is
your
little
red
who
has
brought
you
a
and
a
little
pot
of
butter
mamma
sends
you
the
wolf
cried
out
to
her
softening
his
voice
as
much
as
he
could
pull

pulled
the

seeing

come
in

hiding
himself
under

bedclothes
put
the
cake
and
the
little
pot
of
butter
upon
the
and
come
and
lye
down
with
me
little
red
undressed
herself
and
went
into
bed
where
being
greatly
amazed
to
see
how
her
looked
in
her
she
said
to
her
what
great
arms
you
have
got
that
is
the
better
to
hug
thee
my
dear
what
great
legs
you

to
eat
thee
up
and
saying
these
words
this
wicked
wolf
fell
upon
poor
little
red
and
ate
her
all
up
this
short
story
easy
we
discern
what
conduct
all
young
people
ought
to
learn

above
all
young

therefore

if
so

say
for

too
sure
there
are
of

illustration
is
this
i
see
said
her
mother
the
fairy
there
was
once
upon
a
time
a
widow
who
had
two
daughters
the
eldest
was
so
much
like
her
in
the
face
and
humour
that
whoever
looked
upon
the
daughter
saw
the
mother
they
were
both
so
disagreeable
and
so
proud
that
there
was
no
living
with
them
the
youngest
who
was
the
very
picture
of
her
father
for
courtesy
and
sweetness
of
temper
was
withal
one
of
the
most
beautiful
girls
ever
seen
as
people
naturally
love
their
own
likeness
this
mother
even
doated
on
her
eldest
daughter
and
at
the
same
time
had
a
horrible
aversion
for
the
youngest
she
made
her
eat
in
the
kitchen
and
work
continually
among
other
things
this
poor
child
was
forced
twice
a
day
to
draw
water
above
a
mile
and
a
half
off
the
house
and
bring
home
a
pitcher
full
of
it
one
day
as
she
was
at
this
fountain
there
came
to
her
a
poor
woman
who
begged
of
her
to
let
her
drink
o
ay
with
all
my
heart
goody
said
this
pretty
maid
and
rinsing
immediately
the
pitcher
she
took
up
some
water
from
the
clearest
place
of
the
fountain
and
gave
it
to
her
holding
up
the
pitcher
all
the
while
that
she
might
drink
the
easier
the
good
woman
having
drank
said
to
her
you
are
so
very
pretty
my
dear
so
good
and
so
mannerly
that
i
can
not
help
giving
you
a
gift
for
this
was
a
fairy
who
had
taken
the
form
of
a
poor
to
see
how
far
the
civility
and
good
manners
of
this
pretty
girl
would
go
i
will
give
you
for
gift
continued
the
fairy
that
at
every
word
you
speak
there
shall
come
out
of
your
mouth
either
a
flower
or
a
jewel
when
this
pretty
girl
came
home
her
mother
scolded
at
her
for
staying
so
long
at
the
fountain
i
beg
your
pardon
mamma
said
the
poor
girl
for
not
making
more
haste
and
in
speaking
these
words
there
came
out
of
her
mouth
two
roses
two
pearls
and
two
diamonds
what
is
this
i
see
said
her
mother
quite
astonished
i
think
i
see
pearls
and
diamonds
come
out
of
the
girl
mouth
how
happens
this
child
this
was
the
first
time
she
ever
called
her
child
the
poor
creature
told
her
frankly
all
the
matter
not
without
dropping
out
infinite
numbers
of
diamonds
in
good
faith
cried
the
mother
i
must
send
my
child
thither
come
hither
fanny
look
what
comes
out
of
thy
sister
mouth
when
she
speaks
not
thou
be
glad
my
dear
to
have
the
same
gift
given
to
thee
thou
hast
nothing
else
to
do
but
go
and
draw
water
out
of
the
fountain
and
when
a
certain
poor
woman
asks
thee
to
let
her
drink
to
give
it
her
very
civilly
it
would
be
a
very
fine
sight
indeed
said
this
minx
to
see
me
go
draw
water
you
shall
go
hussey
said
the
mother
and
this
minute
illustration
i
come
hither
to
serve
you
with
water
pray
so
away
she
went
but
grumbling
all
the
way
taking
with
her
the
best
silver
tankard
in
the
house
she
was
no
sooner
at
the
fountain
than
she
saw
coming
out
of
the
wood
a
lady
most
gloriously
dressed
who
came
up
to
her
and
asked
to
drink
this
was
you
must
know
the
very
fairy
who
appeared
to
her
sister
but
had
now
taken
the
air
and
dress
of
a
princess
to
see
how
far
this
girl
rudeness
would
go
am
i
come
hither
said
the
proud
saucy
slut
to
serve
you
with
water
pray
i
suppose
the
silver
tankard
was
brought
purely
for
your
ladyship
was
it
however
you
may
drink
out
of
it
if
you
have
a
fancy
you
are
not
over
and
above
mannerly
answered
the
fairy
without
putting
herself
in
a
passion
well
then
since
you
have
so
little
breeding
and
are
so
disobliging
i
give
you
for
gift
that
at
every
word
you
speak
there
shall
come
out
of
your
mouth
a
snake
or
a
toad
so
soon
as
her
mother
saw
her
coming
she
cried
out
well
daughter
well
mother
answered
the
pert
hussey
throwing
out
of
her
mouth
two
vipers
and
two
toads
o
mercy
cried
the
mother
what
is
it
i
see
o
it
is
that
wretch
her
sister
who
has
occasioned
all
this
but
she
shall
pay
for
it
and
immediately
she
ran
to
beat
her
the
poor
child
fled
away
from
her
and
went
to
hide
herself
in
the
forest
not
far
from
thence
the
king
son
then
on
his
return
from
hunting
met
her
and
seeing
her
so
very
pretty
asked
her
what
she
did
there
alone
and
why
she
cried
alas
sir
my
mamma
has
turned
me
out
of
doors
the
king
son
who
saw
five
or
six
pearls
and
as
many
diamonds
come
out
of
her
mouth
desired
her
to
tell
him
how
that
happened
she
thereupon
told
him
the
whole
story
and
so
the
king
son
fell
in
love
with
her
and
considering
with
himself
that
such
a
gift
was
worth
more
than
any
whatsoever
in
another
conducted
her
to
the
palace
of
the
king
his
father
and
there
married
her
as
for
her
sister
she
made
herself
so
much
hated
that
her
own
mother
turned
her
off
and
the
miserable
wretch
having
wandered
about
a
good
while
without
finding
anybody
to
take
her
in
went
to
a
corner
in
the

there

embroidered
furniture
and
coaches
gilded
all

this

had
the
misfortune
to

a

him
so
frightfully
ugly
that
all

ran
away

a
lady
of
quality

two

desired

the
choice

would

marrying

night

playing
tricks

succeeded

to

so
very
blue

were
the
best
and
richest
furniture
they
could
not
sufficiently
admire
the
number
and
beauty
of
the
tapestry
beds
couches
cabinets
stands
tables
and
in
which
you
might
see
yourself
from
head
to
foot
some
of
them
were
framed
with
glass
others
with
silver
plain
and
gilded
the
finest
and
most
magnificent
which
were
ever
seen
they
ceased
not
to
extol
and
envy
the
happiness
of
their
friend
who
in
the
mean
time
no
way
diverted
herself
in
looking
upon
all
these
rich
things
because
of
the
impatience
she
had
to
go
and
open
the
closet
of
the
ground
floor
she
was
so
much
pressed
by
her
curiosity
that
without
considering
that
it
was
very
uncivil
to
leave
her
company
she
went
down
a
little
and
with
such
excessive
haste
that
she
had
twice
or
thrice
like
to
have
broken
her
neck
being
come
to
the
closet
door
she
made
a
stop
for
some
time
thinking
upon
her
husband
orders
and
considering
what
unhappiness
might
attend
her
if
she
was
disobedient
but
the
temptation
was
so
strong
she
could
not
overcome
it
she
took
then
the
little
key
and
opened
it
trembling
but
could
not
at
first
see
any
thing
plainly
because
the
windows
were
shut
after
some
moments
she
began
to
perceive
that
the
floor
was
all
covered
over
with
clotted
blood
in
which
were
reflected
the
bodies
of
several
dead
women
ranged
against
the
walls
these
were
all
the
wives
whom
blue
beard
had
married
and
murdered
one
after
another
she
was
like
to
have
died
for
fear
and
the
key
which
she
pulled
out
of
the
lock
fell
out
of
her
hand
after
having
somewhat
recovered
her
senses
she
took
up
the
key
locked
the
door
and
went
up
stairs
into
her
chamber
to
recover
herself
but
she
could
not
so
much
was
she
frightened
having
observed
that
the
key
of
the
closet
was
stained
with
blood
she
tried
two
or
three
times
to
wipe
it
off
but
the
blood
would
not
come
off
in
vain
did
she
wash
it
and
even
rub
it
with
soap
and
sand
the
blood
still
remained
for
the
key
was
a
fairy
and
she
could
never
make
it
quite
clean
when
the
blood
was
gone
off
from
one
side
it
came
again
on
the
other
blue
beard
returned
from
his
journey
the
same
evening
and
said
he
had
received
letters
upon
the
road
informing
him
that
the
affair
he
went
about
was
ended
to
his
advantage
his
wife
did
all
she
could
to
convince
him
she
was
extremely
glad
of
his
speedy
return
next
morning
he
asked
her
for
the
keys
which
she
gave
him
but
with
such
a
trembling
hand
that
he
easily
guessed
what
had
happened
what
said
he
is
not
the
key
of
my
closet
among
the
rest
i
must
certainly
answered
she
have
left
it
above
upon
the
table
fail
not
said
blue
beard
to
bring
it
me
presently
after
putting
him
off
several
times
she
was
forced
to
bring
him
the
key
blue
beard
having
very
attentively
considered
it
said
to
his
wife
how
comes
this
blood
upon
the
key
i
do
not
know
cried
the
poor
woman
paler
than
death
you
do
not
know
replied
blue
beard
i
very
well
know
you
were
resolved
to
go
into
the
closet
were
you
not
mighty
well
madam
you
shall
go
in
and
take
your
place
among
the
ladies
you
saw
there
upon
this
she
threw
herself
at
her
husband
feet
and
begged
his
pardon
with
all
the
signs
of
a
true
repentance
for
her
disobedience
she
would
have
melted
a
rock
so
beautiful
and
sorrowful
was
she
but
blue
beard
had
a
heart
harder
than
any
rock
you
must
die
madam
said
he
and
that
presently
since
i
must
die
answered
she
looking
upon
him
with
her
eyes
all
bathed
in
tears
give
me
some
little
time
to
say
my
prayers
i
give
you
replied
blue
beard
half
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
not
one
moment
more
when
she
was
alone
she
called
out
to
her
sister
and
said
to
her
sister
anne
for
that
was
her
name
go
up
i
beg
you
upon
the
top
of
the
tower
and
look
if
my
brothers
are
not
coming
they
promised
me
that
they
would
come
and
if
you
see
them
give
them
a
sign
to
make
haste
her
sister
anne
went
up
upon
the
top
of
the
tower
and
the
poor
afflicted
wife
cried
out
from
time
to
time
anne
sister
anne
do
you
see
any
one
coming
and
sister
anne
said
i
see
nothing
but
the
sun
which
makes
a
dust
and
the
grass
growing
green
in
the
mean
while
blue
beard
holding
a
great
scimitar
in
his
hand
cried
out
as
loud
as
he
could
bawl
to
his
wife
come
down
instantly
or
i
shall
come
up
to
you
one
moment
longer
if
you
please
said
his
wife
and
then
she
cried
out
very
softly
anne
sister
anne
dost
thou
see
any
body
coming
and
sister
anne
answered
i
see
nothing
but
the
sun
which
makes
a
dust
and
the
grass
growing
green
come
down
quickly
cried
blue
beard
or
i
will
come
up
to
you
i
am
coming
answered
his
wife
and
then
she
cried
anne
sister
anne
dost
thou
see
any
one
coming
i
see
replied
sister
anne
a
great
dust
that
comes
this
way
are
they
my
brothers
alas
no
my
dear
sister
i
see
a
flock
of
sheep
will
you
not
come
down
cried
blue
beard
one
moment
longer
said
his
wife
and
then
she
cried
out
anne
sister
anne
dost
thou
see
nobody
coming
i
see
said
she
two
horsemen
coming
but
they
are
yet
a
great
way
off
god
be
praised
she
cried
presently
they
are
my
brothers
i
am
beckoning
to
them
as
well
as
i
can
for
them
to
make
haste
then
blue
beard
bawled
out
so
loud
that
he
made
the
whole
house
tremble
the
distressed
wife
came
down
and
threw
herself
at
his
feet
all
in
tears
with
her
hair
about
her
shoulders
nought
will
avail
said
blue
beard
you
must
die
then
taking
hold
of
her
hair
with
one
hand
and
lifting
up
his
scimitar
with
the
other
he
was
going
to
take
off
her
head
the
poor
lady
turning
about
to
him
and
looking
at
him
with
dying
eyes
desired
him
to
afford
her
one
little
moment
to
recollect
herself
no
no
said
he
recommend
thyself
to
god
and
was
just
ready
to
strike
at
this
very
instant
there
was
such
a
loud
knocking
at
the
gate
that
blue
beard
made
a
sudden
stop
the
gate
was
opened
and
presently
entered
two
horsemen
who
drawing
their
swords
ran
directly
to
blue
beard
he
knew
them
to
be
his
wife
brothers
one
a
dragoon
the
other
a
musqueteer
so
that
he
ran
away
immediately
to
save
himself
but
the
two
brothers
pursued
so
close
that
they
overtook
him
before
he
could
get
to
the
steps
of
the
porch
when
they
ran
their
swords
thro
his
body
and
left
him
dead
the
poor
wife
was
almost
as
dead
as
her
husband
and
had
not
strength
enough
to
rise
and
welcome
her
brothers
blue
beard
had
no
heirs
and
so
his
wife
became
mistress
of
all
his
estate
she
made
use
of
one
part
of
it
to
marry
her
sister
anne
to
a
young
gentleman
who
had
loved
her
a
long
while
another
part
to
buy
captains
commissions
for
her
brothers
and
the
rest
to
marry
herself
to
a
very
worthy
gentleman
who
made
her
forget
the
ill
time
she
had
passed
with
blue
beard
illustration
curiosity
thou
mortal
bane

of
thy
charms
thou
causest
often

and
sore
regret

which

daily

a
thousand
instances

mankind
for
thou
o
may
it
not
displease
the
fair
a
fleeting
pleasure
art
but
lasting
care
and
always
proves
alas
too
dear
the
prize
which
in
the
moment
of
possession
very
little
share
of
common
sense
and
knowledge
of
the
world
will
soon
evince
that
this
a
story
is
of
time

no

such

is
hard
to

which
of
the
two
the
man
or
wife
bears
sleeping
beauty
in
the
illustration
illustration
at
this
very
instant
the
young
fairy
came
out
from
behind
the
hangings
the
sleeping
beauty
in
the
wood
there
were
formerly
a
king
and
a
queen
who
were
so
sorry
that
they
had
no
children
so
sorry
that
it
can
not
be
expressed
they
went
to
all
the
waters
in
the
world
vows
pilgrimages
all
ways
were
tried
and
all
to
no
purpose
at
last
however
the
queen
proved
with
child
and
was
brought
to
bed
of
a
daughter
there
was
a
very
fine
christening
and
the
princess
had
for
her
godmothers
all
the
fairies
they
could
find
in
the
whole
kingdom
they
found
seven
that
every
one
of
them
might
give
her
a
gift
as
was
the
custom
of
fairies
in
those
days
and
that
by
this
means
the
princess
might
have
all
the
perfections
imaginable
after
the
ceremonies
of
the
christening
were
over
all
the
company
returned
to
the
king
palace
where
was
prepared
a
great
feast
for
the
fairies
there
was
placed
before
every
one
of
them
a
magnificent
cover
with
a
case
of
massive
gold
wherein
were
a
spoon
knife
and
fork
all
of
pure
gold
set
with
diamonds
and
rubies
but
as
they
were
all
sitting
down
at
table
they
saw
come
into
the
hall
a
very
old
fairy
whom
they
had
not
invited
because
it
was
above
fifty
years
since
she
had
been
out
of
a
certain
tower
and
she
was
believed
to
be
either
dead
or
inchanted
the
king
ordered
her
a
cover
but
could
not
furnish
her
with
a
case
of
gold
as
the
others
because
they
had
seven
only
made
for
the
seven
fairies
the
old
fairy
fancied
she
was
slighted
and
muttered
some
threat
between
her
teeth
one
of
the
young
fairies
who
sat
by
her
overheard
how
she
grumbled
and
judging
that
she
might
give
the
little
princess
some
unlucky
gift
went
as
soon
as
they
rose
from
the
table
and
hid
herself
behind
the
hangings
that
she
might
speak
last
and
repair
as
much
as
possible
she
could
the
evil
which
the
old
fairy
might
intend
in
the
mean
while
all
the
fairies
began
to
give
their
gifts
to
the
princess
the
youngest
gave
her
for
gift
that
she
should
be
the
most
beautiful
person
in
the
world
the
next
that
she
should
have
the
wit
of
an
angel
the
third
that
she
should
have
a
wonderful
grace
in
every
thing
she
did
the
fourth
that
she
should
dance
perfectly
well
the
fifth
that
she
should
sing
like
a
nightingale
and
the
sixth
that
she
should
play
upon
all
kinds
of
music
to
the
utmost
perfection
the
old
fairy
turn
coming
next
with
a
head
shaking
more
with
spite
than
age
she
said
that
the
princess
should
have
her
hand
pierced
with
a
spindle
and
die
of
the
wound
this
terrible
gift
made
the
whole
company
tremble
and
every
body
fell
at
this
very
instant
the
young
fairy
came
out
from
behind
the
hangings
and
spake
these
words
aloud
be
reassured
o
king
and
queen
your
daughter
shall
not
die
of
this
disaster
it
is
true
i
have
no
power
to
undo
intirely
what
my
elder
has
done
the
princess
shall
indeed
pierce
her
hand
with
a
spindle
but
instead
of
dying
she
shall
only
fall
into
a
profound
sleep
which
shall
last
a
hundred
years
at
the
expiration
of
which
a
king
son
shall
come
and
awake
her
the
king
to
avoid
the
misfortune
foretold
by
the
old
fairy
caused
immediately
proclamations
to
be
made
whereby
was
forbidden
on
pain
of
death
to
spin
with
a
distaff
and
spindle
or
to
have
so
much
as
any
spindle
in
their
houses
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
after
the
king
and
queen
being
gone
to
one
of
their
houses
of
pleasure
the
young
princess
happened
one
day
to
divert
herself
running
up
and
down
the
palace
when
going
up
from
one
apartment
to
another
she
came
into
a
little
room
on
the
top
of
a
tower
where
a
good
old
woman
alone
was
spinning
with
her
spindle
this
good
woman
had
never
heard
of
the
king
proclamation
against
spindles
what
are
you
doing
there
goody
said
the
princess
i
am
spinning
my
pretty
child
said
the
old
woman
who
did
not
know
who
she
was
ha
said
the
princess
this
is
very
pretty
how
do
you
do
it
give
it
to
me
that
i
may
see
if
i
can
do
so
she
had
no
sooner
taken
the
spindle
into
her
hand
than
whether
being
very
hasty
at
it
somewhat
unhandy
or
that
the
decree
of
the
fairy
had
so
ordained
it
it
ran
into
her
hand
and
she
fell
down
in
a
swoon
the
good
old
woman
not
knowing
very
well
what
to
do
in
this
affair
cried
out
for
help
people
came
in
from
every
quarter
in
great
numbers
they
threw
water
upon
the
princess
face
unlaced
her
struck
her
on
the
palms
of
her
hands
and
rubbed
her
temples
with
but
nothing
would
bring
her
to
herself
and
now
the
king
who
came
up
at
the
noise
bethought
himself
of
the
prediction
of
the
fairies
and
judging
very
well
that
this
must
necessarily
come
to
pass
since
the
fairies
had
said
it
caused
the
princess
to
be
carried
into
the
finest
apartment
in
his
palace
and
to
be
laid
upon
a
bed
all
embroidered
with
gold
and
silver
one
would
have
taken
her
for
an
angel
she
was
so
very
beautiful
for
her
swooning
away
had
not
diminished
one
bit
of
her
complexion
her
cheeks
were
carnation
and
her
lips
like
coral
indeed
her
eyes
were
shut
but
she
was
heard
to
breathe
softly
which
satisfied
those
about
her
that
she
was
not
dead
the
king
commanded
that
they
should
not
disturb
her
but
let
her
sleep
quietly
till
her
hour
of
awakening
was
come
the
good
fairy
who
had
saved
her
life
by
condemning
her
to
sleep
a
hundred
years
was
in
the
kingdom
of
matakin
twelve
thousand
leagues
off
when
this
accident
befell
the
princess
but
she
was
instantly
informed
of
it
by
a
little
dwarf
who
had
boots
of
seven
leagues
that
is
boots
with
which
he
could
tread
over
seven
leagues
of
ground
at
one
stride
the
fairy
came
away
immediately
and
she
arrived
about
an
hour
after
in
a
fiery
chariot
drawn
by
dragons
the
king
handed
her
out
of
the
chariot
and
she
approved
every
thing
he
had
done
but
as
she
had
a
very
great
foresight
she
thought
when
the
princess
should
awake
she
might
not
know
what
to
do
with
herself
being
all
alone
in
this
old
palace
and
this
was
what
she
did
she
touched
with
her
wand
every
thing
in
the
palace
except
the
king
and
the
queen
governesses
maids
of
honour
ladies
of
the
bedchamber
gentlemen
officers
stewards
cooks
scullions
guards
with
their
pages
footmen
she
likewise
touched
all
the
horses
which
were
in
the
stables
as
well
as
their
grooms
the
great
dogs
in
the
outward
court
and
pretty
little
mopsey
too
the
princess
little
which
lay
by
her
on
the
bed
immediately
upon
her
touching
them
they
all
fell
asleep
that
they
might
not
awake
before
their
mistress
and
that
they
might
be
ready
to
wait
upon
her
when
she
wanted
them
the
very
spits
at
the
fire
as
full
as
they
could
hold
of
partridges
and
pheasants
did
fall
asleep
and
the
fire
likewise
all
this
was
done
in
a
moment
fairies
are
not
long
in
doing
their
business
and
now
the
king
and
the
queen
having
kissed
their
dear
child
without
waking
her
went
out
of
the
palace
and
put
forth
a
proclamation
that
nobody
should
dare
to
come
near
it
this
however
was
not
necessary
for
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
time
there
grew
up
all
round
about
the
park
such
a
vast
number
of
trees
great
and
small
bushes
and
brambles
twining
one
within
another
that
neither
man
nor
beast
could
pass
thro
so
that
nothing
could
be
seen
but
the
very
top
of
the
towers
of
the
palace
and
that
too
not
unless
it
was
a
good
way
off
nobody
doubted
but
the
fairy
gave
herein
a
sample
of
her
art
that
the
princess
while
she
continued
sleeping
might
have
nothing
to
fear
from
any
curious
people
when
a
hundred
years
were
gone
and
past
the
son
of
the
king
then
reigning
and
who
was
of
another
family
from
that
of
the
sleeping
princess
being
gone
on
that
side
of
the
country
asked
what
were
those
towers
which
he
saw
in
the
middle
of
a
great
thick
wood
every
one
answered
according
as
they
had
heard
some
said
that
it
was
a
ruinous
old
castle
haunted
by
spirits
others
that
all
the
sorcerers
and
witches
of
the
country
kept
there
their
sabbath
or
nights
meeting
the
common
opinion
was
that
an
ogre
lived
there
and
that
he
carried
thither
all
the
little
children
he
could
catch
that
he
might
eat
them
up
at
his
leisure
without
being
able
to
follow
him
as
having
himself
only
the
power
to
pass
the
wood

up
note
by
the
translator
the
prince
was
at
a
stand
not
knowing
what
to
believe
when
a
very
aged
countryman
spake
to
him
thus
may
it
please
your
royal
highness
it
is
now
above
fifty
years
since
i
heard
my
father
who
had
heard
my
grandfather
say
that
there
then
was
in
this
castle
a
princess
the
most
beautiful
was
ever
seen
that
she
must
sleep
there
a
hundred
years
and
should
be
awaked
by
a
king
son
for
whom
she
was
reserved
the
young
prince
was
all
on
fire
at
these
words
believing
without
a
moment
doubt
that
he
could
put
an
end
to
this
rare
adventure
and
pushed
on
by
love
and
honour
resolved
that
moment
to
look
into
it
illustration
the
prince
enquires
of
the
aged
countryman
scarce
had
he
advanced
towards
the
wood
when
all
the
great
trees
the
bushes
and
brambles
gave
way
of
themselves
to
let
him
pass
thro
he
walked
up
to
the
castle
which
he
saw
at
the
end
of
a
large
avenue
which
he
went
into
and
what
a
little
surprised
him
was
that
he
saw
none
of
his
people
could
follow
him
because
the
trees
closed
again
as
soon
as
he
had
pass
thro
them
however
he
did
not
cease
from
continuing
his
way
a
young
and
amorous
prince
is
always
valiant
he
came
into
a
spacious
outward
court
where
everything
he
saw
might
have
frozen
up
the
most
fearless
person
with
horror
there
reigned
over
all
a
most
frightful
silence
the
image
of
death
everywhere
shewed
itself
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
stretched
out
bodies
of
men
and
animals
all
seeming
to
be
dead
he
however
very
well
knew
by
the
ruby
faces
and
pimpled
noses
of
the
that
they
were
only
asleep
and
their
goblets
wherein
still
remained
some
drops
of
wine
shewed
plainly
that
they
fell
asleep
in
their
cups
he
then
crossed
a
court
paved
with
marble
went
up
the
stairs
and
came
into
the
where
the
guards
were
standing
in
their
ranks
with
their
muskets
upon
their
shoulders
and
snoring
as
loud
as
they
could
after
that
he
went
through
several
rooms
full
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
all
asleep
some
standing
others
sitting
at
last
he
came
into
a
chamber
all
gilded
with
gold
where
he
saw
upon
a
bed
the
curtains
of
which
were
all
open
the
finest
sight
was
ever
beheld
a
princess
who
appeared
to
be
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
of
age
and
whose
bright
and
in
a
manner
resplendent
beauty
had
somewhat
in
it
divine
he
approached
with
trembling
and
admiration
and
fell
down
before
her
upon
his
knees
and
now
as
the
inchantment
was
at
an
end
the
princess
awaked
and
looking
on
him
with
eyes
more
tender
than
the
first
view
might
seem
to
admit
of
is
it
you
my
prince
said
she
to
him
you
have
tarried
long
the
prince
charmed
with
these
words
and
much
more
with
the
manner
in
which
they
were
spoken
knew
not
how
to
shew
his
joy
and
gratitude
he
assured
her
that
he
loved
her
better
than
he
did
himself
his
discourse
was
not
well
connected
but
it
pleased
her
all
the
more
little
eloquence
a
great
deal
of
love
he
was
more
at
a
loss
than
she
and
we
need
not
wonder
at
it
she
had
time
to
think
on
what
to
say
to
him
for
it
is
very
probable
though
history
mentions
nothing
of
it
that
the
good
fairy
during
so
long
a
sleep
had
entertained
her
with
pleasant
dreams
in
short
when
they
talked
four
hours
together
they
said
not
half
what
they
had
to
say
illustration
he
saw
upon
a
bed
the
finest
sight
was
ever
beheld
in
the
mean
while
all
the
palace
awaked
every
one
thought
upon
their
particular
business
and
as
all
of
them
were
not
in
love
they
were
ready
to
die
for
hunger
the
chief
lady
of
honour
being
as
sharp
set
as
other
folks
grew
very
impatient
and
told
the
princess
aloud
that
supper
was
served
up
the
prince
helped
the
princess
to
rise
she
was
entirely
dressed
and
very
magnificently
but
his
royal
highness
took
care
not
to
tell
her
that
she
was
dressed
like
his
great
and
had
a
peeping
over
a
high
collar
she
looked
not
a
bit
the
less
beautiful
and
charming
for
all
that
they
went
into
the
great
hall
of
where
they
supped
and
were
served
by
the
princess
officers
the
violins
and
hautboys
played
old
tunes
but
very
excellent
tho
it
was
now
above
a
hundred
years
since
they
had
been
played
and
after
supper
without
losing
any
time
the
lord
almoner
married
them
in
the
chapel
of
the
castle
and
the
chief
lady
of
honour
drew
the
curtains
they
had
but
very
little
sleep
the
princess
had
no
occasion
and
the
prince
left
her
next
morning
to
return
into
the
city
where
his
father
must
needs
have
been
anxious
on
his
account
the
prince
told
him
that
he
lost
his
way
in
the
forest
as
he
was
hunting
and
that
he
had
lain
at
the
cottage
of
a
collier
who
gave
him
cheese
and
brown
bread
the
king
his
father
who
was
of
an
easy
disposition
believed
him
but
his
mother
could
not
be
persuaded
this
was
true
and
seeing
that
he
went
almost
every
day
and
that
he
always
had
some
excuse
ready
when
he
had
laid
out
three
or
four
nights
together
she
no
longer
doubted
he
had
some
little
amour
for
he
lived
with
the
princess
above
two
whole
years
and
had
by
her
two
children
the
eldest
of
which
who
was
a
daughter
was
named
aurora
and
the
youngest
who
was
a
son
they
called
day
because
he
was
even
handsomer
and
more
beautiful
than
his
sister
the
queen
said
more
than
once
to
her
son
in
order
to
bring
him
to
speak
freely
to
her
that
a
young
man
must
take
his
pleasure
but
he
never
dared
to
trust
her
with
his
secret
he
feared
her
tho
he
loved
her
for
she
was
of
the
race
of
the
ogres
and
the
king
would
never
have
married
her
had
it
not
been
for
her
vast
riches
it
was
even
whispered
about
the
court
that
she
had
ogreish
inclinations
and
that
whenever
she
saw
little
children
passing
by
she
had
all
the
difficulty
in
the
world
to
refrain
from
falling
upon
them
and
so
the
prince
would
never
tell
her
one
word
but
when
the
king
was
dead
which
happened
about
two
years
afterwards
and
he
saw
himself
lord
and
master
he
openly
declared
his
marriage
and
he
went
in
great
ceremony
to
fetch
his
queen
from
the
castle
they
made
a
magnificent
entry
into
the
capital
city
she
riding
between
her
two
children
some
time
after
the
king
went
to
make
war
with
the
emperor
cantalabutte
his
neighbour
he
left
the
government
of
the
kingdom
to
the
queen
his
mother
and
earnestly
recommended
to
her
care
his
wife
and
children
he
was
like
to
be
at
war
all
the
summer
and
as
soon
as
he
departed
the
sent
her
and
her
children
to
a
among
the
woods
that
she
might
with
the
more
ease
gratify
her
horrible
longing
illustration
will
have
it
so
replied
the
queen
will
eat
her
with
a
sauce
robert
some
few
days
afterwards
she
went
thither
herself
and
said
to
her
clerk
of
the
kitchen
i
have
a
mind
to
eat
little
aurora
for
my
dinner
to
morrow
ah
madam
cried
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
i
will
have
it
so
replied
the
queen
and
this
she
spake
in
the
tone
of
an
ogress
who
had
a
strong
desire
to
eat
fresh
meat
and
will
eat
her
with
a
sauce

note
by
the
translator
the
poor
man
knowing
very
well
that
he
must
not
play
tricks
with
ogresses
took
his
great
knife
and
went
up
into
little
chamber
she
was
then
four
years
old
and
came
up
to
him
jumping
and
laughing
to
take
him
about
the
neck
and
ask
him
for
some
upon
which
he
began
to
weep
the
great
knife
fell
out
of
his
hand
and
he
went
into
the
and
killed
a
little
lamb
and
dressed
it
with
such
good
sauce
that
his
mistress
assured
him
she
had
never
eaten
anything
so
good
in
her
life
he
had
at
the
same
time
taken
up
little
aurora
and
carried
her
to
his
wife
to
conceal
her
in
the
lodging
he
had
at
the
end
of
the
court
yard
about
eight
days
afterwards
the
wicked
queen
said
to
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
i
will
sup
upon
little
day
he
answered
not
a
word
being
resolved
to
cheat
her
as
he
had
done
before
he
went
to
find
out
little
day
and
saw
him
with
a
little
foil
in
his
hand
with
which
he
was
fencing
with
a
great
monkey
the
child
being
then
only
three
years
of
age
he
took
him
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
to
his
wife
that
she
might
conceal
him
in
her
chamber
along
with
his
sister
and
in
the
room
of
little
day
cooked
up
a
young
kid
very
tender
which
the
ogress
found
to
be
wonderfully
good
this
was
hitherto
all
mighty
well
but
one
evening
this
wicked
queen
said
to
her
clerk
of
the
kitchen
i
will
eat
the
queen
with
the
same
sauce
i
had
with
her
children
it
was
now
that
the
poor
clerk
of
the
kitchen
despaired
of
being
able
to
deceive
her
the
young
queen
was
turned
of
twenty
not
reckoning
the
hundred
years
she
had
been
asleep
her
skin
was
somewhat
tough
tho
very
fair
and
white
and
how
to
find
in
the
yard
a
beast
so
firm
was
what
puzzled
him
he
took
then
a
resolution
that
he
might
save
his
own
life
to
cut
the
queen
throat
and
going
up
into
her
chamber
with
intent
to
do
it
at
once
he
put
himself
into
as
great
a
fury
as
he
could
possibly
and
came
into
the
young
queen
room
with
his
dagger
in
his
hand
he
would
not
however
surprise
her
but
told
her
with
a
great
deal
of
respect
the
orders
he
had
received
from
the
do
it
do
it
said
she
stretching
out
her
neck
execute
your
orders
and
then
i
shall
go
and
see
my
children
my
poor
children
whom
i
so
much
and
so
tenderly
loved
for
she
thought
them
dead
ever
since
they
had
been
taken
away
without
her
knowledge
no
no
madam
cried
the
poor
clerk
of
the
kitchen
all
in
tears
you
shall
not
die
and
yet
you
shall
see
your
children
again
but
it
must
be
in
my
lodgings
where
i
have
concealed
them
and
i
shall
deceive
the
queen
once
more
by
giving
her
in
your
stead
a
young
hind
upon
this
he
forthwith
conducted
her
to
his
chamber
where
leaving
her
to
embrace
her
children
and
cry
along
with
them
he
went
and
dressed
a
hind
which
the
queen
had
for
her
supper
and
devoured
it
with
the
same
appetite
as
if
it
had
been
the
young
queen
exceedingly
was
she
delighted
with
her
cruelty
and
she
had
invented
a
story
to
tell
the
king
at
his
return
how
ravenous
wolves
had
eaten
up
the
queen
his
wife
and
her
two
children
one
evening
as
she
was
according
to
her
custom
rambling
round
about
the
courts
and
yards
of
the
palace
to
see
if
she
could
smell
any
fresh
meat
she
heard
in
a
little
day
crying
for
his
mamma
was
going
to
whip
him
because
he
had
been
naughty
and
she
heard
at
the
same
time
little
aurora
begging
pardon
for
her
brother
the
ogress
presently
knew
the
voice
of
the
queen
and
her
children
and
being
quite
mad
that
she
had
been
thus
deceived
she
commanded
next
morning
by
break
of
day
with
a
most
horrible
voice
which
made
every
body
tremble
that
they
should
bring
into
the
middle
of
the
great
court
a
large
tub
which
she
caused
to
be
filled
with
toads
vipers
snakes
and
all
sorts
of
serpents
in
order
to
have
thrown
into
it
the
queen
and
her
children
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
his
wife
and
maid
all
whom
she
had
given
orders
should
be
brought
thither
with
their
hands
tied
behind
them
they
were
brought
out
accordingly
and
the
executioners
were
just
going
to
throw
them
into
the
tub
when
the
king
who
was
not
so
soon
expected
entered
the
court
on
for
he
came
post
and
asked
with
the
utmost
astonishment
what
was
the
meaning
of
that
horrible
spectacle
no
one
dared
to
tell
him
when
the
ogress
all
inraged
to
see
what
had
happened
threw
herself
into
the
tub
and
was
instantly
devoured
by
the
ugly
creatures
she
had
ordered
to
be
thrown
into
it
for
others
the
king
could
not
but
be
very
sorry
for
she
was
his
mother
but
he
soon
comforted
himself
with
his
beautiful
wife
and
his
pretty
children

of
his
skin
i
must
die
with
hunger
the
cat
who
heard
all
this
but
made
as
if
he
did
not
said
to
him
with
a
grave
and
serious
air
do
not
thus
afflict
yourself
my
good
master
you
have
only
to
give
me
a
bag
and
get
a
pair
of
boots
made
for
me
that
i
may
scamper
thro
the
dirt
and
the
brambles
and
you
shall
see
that
you
have
not
so
bad
a
portion
of
me
as
you
imagine
tho
the
cat
master
did
not
build
very
much
upon
what
he
said
he
had
however
often
seen
him
play
a
great
many
cunning
tricks
to
catch
rats
and
mice
as
when
he
used
to
hang
by
the
heels
or
hide
himself
in
the
meal
and
make
as
if
he
were
dead
so
that
he
did
not
altogether
despair
of
his
affording
him
some
help
in
his
miserable
condition
when
the
cat
had
what
he
asked
for
he
booted
himself
very
gallantly
and
putting
his
bag
about
his
neck
he
held
the
strings
of
it
in
his
two
fore
paws
and
went
into
a
warren
where
was
great
abundance
of
rabbits
he
put
bran
and
into
his
bag
and
stretching
himself
out
at
length
as
if
he
had
been
dead
he
waited
for
some
young
rabbit
not
yet
acquainted
with
the
deceits
of
the
world
to
come
and
rummage
his
bag
for
what
he
had
put
into
it
scarce
was
he
lain
down
but
he
had
what
he
wanted
a
rash
and
foolish
young
rabbit
jumped
into
his
bag
and
monsieur
puss
immediately
drawing
close
the
strings
took
and
killed
him
without
pity
proud
of
his
prey
he
went
with
it
to
the
palace
and
asked
to
speak
with
his
majesty
he
was
shewed
up
stairs
into
the
king
apartment
and
making
a
low
reverence
said
to
him
i
have
brought
you
sir
a
rabbit
of
the
warren
which
my
noble
lord
the
marquis
of
carabas
for
that
was
the
title
which
puss
was
pleased
to
give
his
master
has
commanded
me
to
present
to
your
majesty
from
him
tell
thy
master
said
the
king
that
i
thank
him
and
that
he
does
me
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
another
time
he
went
and
hid
himself
among
some
standing
corn
holding
still
his
bag
open
and
when
a
brace
of
partridges
ran
into
it
he
drew
the
strings
and
so
caught
them
both
he
went
and
made
a
present
of
these
to
the
king
as
he
had
done
before
of
the
rabbit
which
he
took
in
the
warren
the
king
in
like
manner
received
the
partridges
with
great
pleasure
and
ordered
him
some
money
to
drink
the
cat
continued
for
two
or
three
months
thus
to
carry
his
majesty
from
time
to
time
game
of
his
master
taking
one
day
in
particular
when
he
knew
for
certain
that
the
king
was
to
take
the
air
along
the
river
side
with
his
daughter
the
most
beautiful
princess
in
the
world
he
said
to
his
master
if
you
will
follow
my
advice
your
fortune
is
made
you
have
nothing
else
to
do
but
go
and
wash
yourself
in
the
river
in
that
part
i
shall
shew
you
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
the
marquis
of
carabas
did
what
the
cat
advised
him
to
without
knowing
why
or
wherefore
while
he
was
washing
the
king
passed
by
and
the
cat
began
to
cry
out
as
loud
as
he
could
help
help
my
lord
marquis
of
carabas
is
drowning
at
this
noise
the
king
put
his
head
out
of
his
and
finding
it
was
the
cat
who
had
so
often
brought
him
such
good
game
he
commanded
his
guards
to
run
immediately
to
the
assistance
of
his
lordship
the
marquis
of
carabas
while
they
were
drawing
the
poor
marquis
out
of
the
river
the
cat
came
up
to
the
coach
and
told
the
king
that
while
his
master
was
washing
there
came
by
some
rogues
who
went
off
with
his
clothes
tho
he
had
cried
out
thieves
thieves
several
times
as
loud
as
he
could
this
cunning
cat
had
hidden
them
under
a
great
stone
the
king
immediately
commanded
the
officers
of
his
wardrobe
to
run
and
fetch
one
of
his
best
suits
for
the
lord
marquis
of
carabas
the
king
received
him
with
great
kindness
and
as
the
fine
clothes
he
had
given
him
extremely
set
off
his
good
mien
for
he
was
well
made
and
very
handsome
in
his
person
the
king
daughter
took
a
secret
inclination
to
him
and
the
marquis
of
carabas
had
no
sooner
cast
two
or
three
respectful
and
somewhat
tender
glances
but
she
fell
in
love
with
him
to
distraction
the
king
would
needs
have
him
come
into
his
coach
and
take
part
of
the
airing
the
cat
quite
overjoyed
to
see
his
project
begin
to
succeed
marched
on
before
and
meeting
with
some
countrymen
who
were
mowing
a
meadow
he
said
to
them
good
people
you
who
are
mowing
if
you
do
not
tell
the
king
that
the
meadow
you
mow
belongs
to
my
lord
marquis
of
carabas
you
shall
be
chopped
as
small
as
the
king
did
not
fail
asking
of
the
mowers
to
whom
the
meadow
they
were
mowing
belonged
to
my
lord
marquis
of
carabas
answered
they
all
together
for
the
cat
threats
had
made
them
terribly
afraid
truly
a
fine
estate
said
the
king
to
the
marquis
of
carabas
you
see
sir
said
the
marquis
this
is
a
meadow
which
never
fails
to
yield
a
plentiful
harvest
every
year
the
master
cat
who
still
went
on
before
met
with
some
reapers
and
said
to
them
good
people
you
who
are
reaping
if
you
do
not
tell
the
king
that
all
this
corn
belongs
to
the
marquis
of
carabas
you
shall
be
chopped
as
small
as
the
king
who
passed
by
a
moment
after
would
needs
know
to
whom
all
that
corn
which
he
then
saw
did
belong
to
my
lord
marquis
of
carabas
replied
the
reapers
and
the
king
again
congratulated
the
marquis
the
master
cat
who
went
always
before
said
the
same
words
to
all
he
met
and
the
king
was
astonished
at
the
vast
estates
of
my
lord
marquis
of
carabas
monsieur
puss
came
at
last
to
a
stately
castle
the
master
of
which
was
an
ogre
the
richest
had
ever
been
known
for
all
the
lands
which
the
king
had
then
gone
over
belonged
to
this
castle
the
cat
who
had
taken
care
to
inform
himself
who
this
ogre
was
and
what
he
could
do
asked
to
speak
with
him
saying
he
could
not
pass
so
near
his
castle
without
having
the
honour
of
paying
his
respects
to
him
the
ogre
received
him
as
civilly
as
an
ogre
could
do
and
made
him
sit
down
i
have
been
assured
said
the
cat
that
you
have
the
gift
of
being
able
to
change
yourself
into
all
sorts
of
creatures
you
have
a
mind
to
you
can
for
example
transform
yourself
into
a
lion
or
elephant
and
the
like
this
is
true
answered
the
ogre
very
briskly
and
to
convince
you
you
shall
see
me
now
become
a
lion
puss
was
so
sadly
terrified
at
the
sight
of
a
lion
so
near
him
that
he
immediately
got
into
the
gutter
not
without
abundance
of
trouble
and
danger
because
of
his
boots
which
were
for
walking
upon
the
tiles
a
little
while
after
when
puss
saw
that
the
ogre
had
resumed
his
natural
form
he
came
down
and
owned
he
had
been
very
much
frightened
i
have
been
moreover
informed
said
the
cat
but
i
know
not
how
to
believe
it
that
you
have
also
the
power
to
take
on
you
the
shape
of
the
smallest
animals
for
example
to
change
yourself
into
a
rat
or
a
mouse
but
i
must
own
to
you
i
take
this
to
be
impossible
impossible
cried
the
ogre
you
shall
see
that
presently
and
at
the
same
time
changed
into
a
mouse
and
began
to
run
about
the
floor
puss
no
sooner
perceived
this
but
he
fell
upon
him
and
ate
him
up
meanwhile
the
king
who
saw
as
he
passed
this
fine
castle
of
the
ogre
had
a
mind
to
go
into
it
puss
who
heard
the
noise
of
his
majesty
coach
running
over
the
drawbridge
ran
out
and
said
to
the
king
your
majesty
is
welcome
to
this
castle
of
my
lord
marquis
of
carabas
what
my
lord
marquis
cried
the
king
and

this
castle

you

once
there
was
a
gentleman
who
married
for
his
second
wife
the
proudest
and
most
haughty
woman
that
was
ever
seen
she
had
by
a
former
husband
two
daughters
of
her
own
humour
and
they
were
indeed
exactly
like
her
in
all
things
he
had
likewise
by
another
wife
a
young
daughter
but
of
unparalleled
goodness
and
sweetness
of
temper
which
she
took
from
her
mother
who
was
the
best
creature
in
the
world
no
sooner
were
the
ceremonies
of
the
wedding
over
but
the
stepmother
began
to
shew
herself
in
her
colours
she
could
not
bear
the
good
qualities
of
this
pretty
girl
and
the
less
because
they
made
her
own
daughters
appear
the
more
odious
she
employed
her
in
the
meanest
work
of
the
house
she
scoured
the
dishes
tables
and
rubbed
chamber
and
those
of
misses
her
daughters
she
lay
up
in
a
sorry
garret
upon
a
wretched
while
her
sisters
lay
in
fine
rooms
with
floors
all
inlaid
upon
beds
of
the
very
newest
fashion
and
where
they
had
so
large
that
they
might
see
themselves
at
their
full
length
from
head
to
foot
the
poor
girl
bore
all
patiently
and
dared
not
tell
her
father
who
would
have
rattled
her
off
for
his
wife
governed
him
intirely
when
she
had
done
her
work
she
used
to
go
into
the
and
sit
down
among
cinders
and
ashes
which
made
her
commonly
be
called
but
the
youngest
who
was
not
so
rude
and
uncivil
as
the
eldest
called
her
cinderilla
however
cinderilla
notwithstanding
her
mean
apparel
was
a
hundred
times
handsomer
than
her
sisters
tho
they
were
always
dressed
very
richly
it
happened
that
the
king
son
gave
a
ball
and
invited
all
persons
of
fashion
to
it
our
young
misses
were
also
invited
for
they
cut
a
very
grand
figure
among
the
quality
they
were
mightily
delighted
at
this
invitation
and
wonderfully
busy
in
chusing
out
such
gowns
petticoats
and
as
might
best
become
them
this
was
a
new
trouble
to
cinderilla
for
it
was
she
who
ironed
her
sisters
linen
and
plaited
their
ruffles
they
talked
all
day
long
of
nothing
but
how
they
should
be
dressed
for
my
part
said
the
eldest
i
will
wear
my
red
velvet
suit
with
french
trimming
and
i
said
the
youngest
shall
only
have
my
usual
petticoat
but
then
to
make
amends
for
that
i
will
put
on
my
manteau
and
my
diamond
stomacher
which
is
far
from
being
the
most
ordinary
one
in
the
world
they
sent
for
the
best
they
could
get
to
make
up
their
and
adjust

they
had
their

brushes
and

any
one
but
cinderilla
would
have
dressed
their
heads
awry
cinderilla
was
likewise
called
up
to
them
to
be
consulted
in
all
these
matters
for
she
had
excellent
notions
and
advised
them
always
for
the
best
nay
and
offered
her
service
to
dress
their
heads
which
they
were
very
willing
she
should
do
as
she
was
doing
this
they
said
to
her
cinderilla
would
you
not
be
glad
to
go
to
the
ball
ah
said
she
you
only
jeer
at
me
it
is
not
for
such
as
i
am
to
go
thither
thou
art
in
the
right
of
it
replied
they
it
would
make
the
people
laugh
to
see
a
at
a
ball
any
one
but
cinderilla
would
have
dressed
their
heads
awry
but
she
was
very
good
and
dressed
them
perfectly
well
they
were
almost
two
days
without
eating
so
much
they
were
transported
with
joy
they
broke
above
a
dozen
of
laces
in
trying
to
be
laced
up
close
that
they
might
have
a
fine
slender
shape
and
they
were
continually
at
their
at
last
the
happy
day
came
they
went
to
court
and
cinderilla
followed
them
with
her
eyes
as
long
as
she
could
and
when
she
had
lost
sight
of
them
she
fell
her
godmother
who
saw
her
all
in
tears
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
i
wish
i
could
i
wish
i
could
she
was
not
able
to
speak
the
rest
being
interrupted
by
her
tears
and
sobbing
this
godmother
of
hers
who
was
a
fairy
said
to
her
thou
wishest
thou
couldest
go
to
the
ball
is
it
not
so
y
es
cried
cinderilla
with
a
great
sigh
well
said
her
godmother
be
but
a
good
girl
and
i
will
contrive
that
thou
shalt
go
then
she
took
her
into
her
chamber
and
said
to
her
run
into
the
garden
and
bring
me
a
pumpkin
cinderilla
went
immediately
to
gather
the
finest
she
could
get
and
brought
it
to
her
godmother
not
being
able
to
imagine
how
this
pumpkin
could
make
her
go
to
the
ball
her
godmother
scooped
out
all
the
inside
of
it
leaving
nothing
but
the
rind
which
done
she
struck
it
with
her
wand
and
the
pumpkin
was
instantly
turned
into
a
fine
coach
gilded
all
over
with
gold
she
then
went
to
look
into
her
where
she
found
six
mice
all
alive
and
ordered
cinderilla
to
lift
up
a
little
the
when
giving
each
mouse
as
it
went
out
a
little
tap
with
her
wand
the
mouse
was
at
that
moment
turned
into
a
fair
horse
which
altogether
made
a
very
fine
set
of
six
horses
of
a
beautiful
being
at
a
loss
for
a
coachman
i
will
go
and
see
says
cinderilla
if
there
be
never
a
rat
in
the
that
we
may
make
a
coachman
of
him
thou
art
in
the
right
replied
her
godmother
go
and
look
cinderilla
brought
the
trap
to
her
and
in
it
there
were
three
huge
rats
the
fairy
made
choice
of
one
of
the
three
which
had
the
largest
beard
and
having
touched
him
with
her
wand
he
was
turned
into
a
fat
jolly
coachman
who
had
the
smartest
whiskers
eyes
ever
beheld
after
that
she
said
to
her
go
again
into
the
garden
and
you
will
find
six
lizards
behind
the
watering
pot
bring
them
to
me
she
had
no
sooner
done
so
but
her
godmother
turned
them
into
six
footmen
who
skipped
up
immediately
behind
the
coach
with
their
liveries
all
bedaubed
with
gold
and
silver
and
clung
as
close
behind
it
as
if
they
had
done
nothing
else
their
whole
lives
the
fairy
then
said
to
cinderilla
well
you
see
here
an
equipage
fit
to
go
to
the
ball
with
are
you
not
pleased
with
it
o
yes
cried
she
but
must
i
go
thither
as
i
am
in
these
poison
nasty
rags
her
godmother
only
just
touched
her
with
her
wand
and
at
the
same
instant
her
clothes
were
turned
into
cloth
of
gold
and
silver
all
beset
with
jewels
this
done
she
gave
her
a
pair
of
the
prettiest
in
the
whole
world
footnote
in
perrault
tale
de
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
the
medieval
versions
of
this
ancient
tale
cinderilla
was
given
de
of
a
grey
or
grey
and
white
fur
the
exact
nature
of
which
has
been
a
matter
of
controversy
but
which
was
probably
a
grey
squirrel
long
before
the
seventeenth
century
the
word
had
passed
out
of
use
except
as
a
heraldic
term
and
had
ceased
to
convey
any
meaning
to
the
people
thus
the
de
of
the
fairy
tale
became
in
the
oral
tradition
the
homonymous
de
or
glass
slippers
a
delightful
improvement
on
the
earlier
version
being
thus
decked
out
she
got
up
into
her
coach
but
her
godmother
above
all
things
commanded
her
not
to
stay
till
after
midnight
telling
her
at
the
same
time
that
if
she
stayed
at
the
ball
one
moment
longer
her
coach
would
be
a
pumpkin
again
her
horses
mice
her
coachman
a
rat
her
footmen
lizards
and
her
clothes
become
just
as
they
were
before
she
promised
her
godmother
she
would
not
fail
of
leaving
the
ball
before
midnight
and
then
away
she
drove
scarce
able
to
contain
herself
for
joy
the
king
son
who
was
told
that
a
great
princess
whom
nobody
knew
was
come
ran
out
to
receive
her
he
gave
her
his
hand
as
she
alighted
out
of
the
coach
and
led
her
into
the
hall
among
all
the
company
there
was
immediately
a
profound
silence
they
left
off
dancing
and
the
violins
ceased
to
play
so
attentive
was
every
one
to
contemplate
the
singular
beauty
of
this
unknown
new
comer
nothing
was
then
heard
but
a
confused
noise
of
ha
how
handsome
she
is
ha
how
handsome
she
is
the
king
himself
old
as
he
was
could
not
help
ogling
her
and
telling
the
queen
softly
that
it
was
a
long
time
since
he
had
seen
so
beautiful
and
lovely
a
creature
all
the
ladies
were
busied
in
considering
her
clothes
and
that
they
might
have
some
made
next
day
after
the
same
pattern
provided
they
could
meet
with
such
fine
materials
and
as
able
hands
to
make
them
the
king
son
conducted
her
to
the
most
honourable
seat
and
afterwards
took
her
out
to
dance
with
him
she
danced
so
very
gracefully
that
they
all
more
and
more
admired
her
a
fine
collation
was
served
up
whereof
the
young
prince
ate
not
a
morsel
so
intently
was
he
busied
in
gazing
on
her
she
went
and
sat
down
by
her
sisters
shewing
them
a
thousand
civilities
giving
them
part
of
the
oranges
and
citrons
which
the
prince
had
presented
her
with
which
very
much
surprised
them
for
they
did
not
know
her
while
cinderilla
was
thus
amusing
her
sisters
she
heard
the
clock
strike
eleven
and
three
quarters
whereupon
she
immediately
made
a
curtesy
to
the
company
and
hasted
away
as
fast
as
she
could
being
got
home
she
ran
to
seek
out
her
godmother
and
after
having
thanked
her
she
said
she
could
not
but
heartily
wish
she
might
go
next
day
to
the
ball
because
the
king
son
had
desired
her
as
she
was
eagerly
telling
her
godmother
whatever
had
passed
at
the
ball
her
two
sisters
knocked
at
the
door
which
cinderilla
ran
and
opened
how
long
you
have
stayed
cried
she
gaping
rubbing
her
eyes
and
stretching
herself
as
if
she
had
been
just
awaked
out
of
her
sleep
she
had
not
however
any
manner
of
inclination
to
sleep
since
they
went
from
home
if
thou
hadst
been
at
the
ball
said
one
of
her
sisters
thou
wouldst
not
have
been
tired
with
it
there
came
thither
the
finest
princess
the
most
beautiful
ever
was
seen
with
mortal
eyes
she
shewed
us
a
thousand
civilities
and
gave
us
oranges
and
citrons
cinderilla
was
transported
with
joy
she
asked
them
the
name
of
that
princess
but
they
told
her
they
did
not
know
it
and
that
the
son
was
very
anxious
to
learn
it
and
would
give
all
the
world
to
know
who
she
was
at
this
cinderilla
smiling
replied
she
must
then
be
very
beautiful
indeed
lord
how
happy
have
you
been
could
not
i
see
her
ah
dear
miss
charlotte
do
lend
me
your
yellow
suit
of
cloaths
which
you
wear
every
day
ay
to
be
sure
cried
miss
charlotte
lend
my
cloaths
to
such
a
dirty
as
thou
art
who
the
fool
then
cinderilla
indeed
expected
some
such
answer
and
was
very
glad
of
the
refusal
for
she
would
have
been
sadly
put
to
it
if
her
sister
had
lent
her
what
she
asked
for
jestingly
the
next
day
the
two
sisters
were
at
the
ball
and
so
was
cinderilla
but
dressed
more
magnificently
than
before
the
king
son
was
always
by
her
and
never
ceased
his
compliments
and
amorous
speeches
to
her
to
whom
all
this
was
so
far
from
being
tiresome
that
she
quite
forgot
what
her
godmother
had
recommended
to
her
so
that
she
at
last
counted
the
clock
striking
twelve
when
she
took
it
to
be
no
more
than
eleven
she
then
rose
up
and
fled
as
nimble
as
a
deer
the
prince
followed
but
could
not
overtake
her
she
left
behind
one
of
her
glass
slippers
which
the
prince
took
up
most
carefully
she
got
home
but
quite
out
of
breath
without
coach
or
footmen
and
in
her
nasty
old
cloaths
having
nothing
left
her
of
all
her
finery
but
one
of
the
little
slippers
fellow
to
that
she
dropped
the
guards
at
the
palace
gate
were
asked
if
they
had
not
seen
a
princess
go
out
who
said
they
had
seen
nobody
go
out
but
a
young
girl
very
meanly
dressed
and
who
had
more
the
air
of
a
poor
country
wench
than
a
illustration
she
left
behind
one
of
her
glass
slippers
which
the
prince
took
up
most
carefully
when
the
two
sisters
returned
from
the
ball
cinderilla
asked
them
if
they
had
been
well
diverted
and
if
the
fine
lady
had
been
there
they
told
her
yes
but
that
she
hurried
away
immediately
when
it
struck
twelve
and
with
so
much
haste
that
she
dropped
one
of
her
little
glass
slippers
the
prettiest
in
the
world
and
which
the
king
son
had
taken
up
that
he
had
done
nothing
but
look
at
it
during
all
the
latter
part
of
the
ball
and
that
most
certainly
he
was
very
much
in
love
with
the
beautiful
person
who
owned
the
little
slipper
what
they
said
was
very
true
for
a
few
days
after
the
king
son
caused
it
to
be
proclaimed
by
sound
of
trumpet
that
he
would
marry
her
whose
foot
this
slipper
would
just
fit
they
whom
he
employed
began
to
try
it
on
upon
the
princesses
then
the
duchesses
and
all
the
court
but
in
vain
it
was
brought
to
the
two
sisters
who
did
all
they
possibly
could
to
thrust
their
feet
into
the
slipper
but
they
could
not
effect
it
cinderilla
who
saw
all
this
and
knew
her
slipper
said
to
them
laughing
let
me
see
if
it
will
not
fit
me
her
sisters
burst
out
and
began
to
banter
her
the
gentleman
who
was
sent
to
try
the
slipper
looked
earnestly
at
cinderilla
and
finding
her
very
handsome
said
it
was
but
just
that
she
should
try
and
that
he
had
orders
to
let
every
one
make
tryal
he
invited
cinderilla
to
sit
down
and
putting
the
slipper
to
her
foot
he
found
it
went
on
very
easily
and
fitted
her
as
if
it
had
been
made
of
wax
the
astonishment
her
two
sisters
were
in
was
excessively
great
but
still
abundantly
greater
when
cinderilla
pulled
out
of
her
pocket
the
other
slipper
and
put
it
on
her
foot
thereupon
in
came
her
godmother
who
having
touched
with
her
wand
cloaths
made
them
richer
and
more
magnificent
than
any
of
those
she
had
before
and
now
her
two
sisters
found
her
to
be
that
fine
beautiful
lady
whom
they
had
seen
at
the
ball
they
threw
themselves
at
her
feet
to
beg
pardon
for
all
the
ill
treatment
they
had
made
her
undergo
cinderilla
took
them
up
and
as
she
embraced
them
cried
that
she
forgave
them
with
all
her
heart
and
desired
them
always
to
love
her
she
was
conducted
to
the
young
prince
dressed
as
she
was
he
thought
her
more
charming
than
ever
and
a
few
days
after
married
her
cinderilla
who
was
no
less
good
than
beautiful
gave
her
two
sisters
lodgings
in
the
palace
and
that
very
same
day
matched
them
with
two
great
lords
of
the
court
illustration
to
the
sex
a
treasure
still
admir
beyond
all
measure
and
never
yet
was
any
known
by
still
admiring
weary
grown
but
that
rare
quality
call
grace
exceeds
by
far
a
handsome
face
its
lasting
charms
surpass
the
other
and
this
rich
gift
her
kind
godmother
bestow
on
cinderilla
fair
whom
she
instructed
with
such
care
she
gave
to
her
such
graceful
mien
that
she
thereby
became
a
queen
for
thus
may
ever
truth
prevail
we
draw
our
moral
from
this
tale
this
quality
fair
ladies
know
prevails
much
more
you
find
it
so
and
captivate
a
heart
than
a
fine
head

up
with
art
the
fairies
gift
of
greatest
worth

grace
of
bearing
not
high
birth
without
this
gift

advantage
is
no

to

to
have
wit

sense
and

other
qualities

we
receiv
from

none
of

graces

above

world

prove

godmothers
and
sires
you
disobey
or
their
strict
advice
too
long
you
illustration
with
the
illustration
riquet
with
the
tuft
there
was
once
upon
a
time
a
queen
who
was
brought
to
bed
of
a
son
so
hideously
ugly
that
it
was
long
disputed
whether
he
had
human
form
a
fairy
who
was
at
his
birth
affirmed
he
would
be
very
lovable
for
all
that
since
he
should
be
indowed
with
abundance
of
wit
she
even
added
that
it
would
be
in
his
power
by
virtue
of
a
gift
she
had
just
then
given
him
to
bestow
on
the
person
he
most
loved
as
much
wit
as
he
pleased
all
this
somewhat
comforted
the
poor
queen
who
was
under
a
grievous
affliction
for
having
brought
into
the
world
such
an
ugly
brat
it
is
true
that
this
child
no
sooner
began
to
prattle
but
he
said
a
thousand
pretty
things
and
that
in
all
his
actions
there
was
something
so
taking
that
he
charmed
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
he
came
into
the
world
with
a
little
tuft
of
hair
upon
his
head
which
made
them
call
him
riquet
with
the
tuft
for
riquet
was
the
family
name
seven
or
eight
years
after
this
the
queen
of
a
neighbouring
kingdom
was
delivered
of
two
daughters
at
a
birth
the
of
these
was
beautiful
beyond
compare
whereat
the
queen
was
so
very
glad
that
those
present
were
afraid
that
her
excess
of
joy
would
do
her
harm
the
same
fairy
who
had
assisted
at
the
birth
of
little
riquet
with
the
tuft
was
here
also
and
to
moderate
the
queen
gladness
she
declared
that
this
little
princess
should
have
no
wit
at
all
but
be
as
stupid
as
she
was
pretty
this
mortified
the
queen
extreamly
but
some
moments
afterwards
she
had
far
greater
sorrow
for
the
second
daughter
she
was
delivered
of
was
very
ugly
do
not
afflict
yourself
so
much
madam
said
the
fairy
your
daughter
shall
have
so
great
a
portion
of
wit
that
her
want
of
beauty
will
scarcely
be
perceived
god
grant
it
replied
the
queen
but
is
there
no
way
to
make
the
eldest
who
is
so
pretty
have
some
little
wit
i
can
do
nothing
for
her
madam
as
to
wit
answered
the
fairy
but
everything
as
to
beauty
and
as
there
is
nothing
but
what
i
would
do
for
your
satisfaction
i
give
her
for
gift
that
she
shall
have
the
power
to
make
handsome
the
person
who
shall
best
please
her
as
these
princesses
grew
up
their
perfections
grew
up
with
them
all
the
public
talk
was
of
the
beauty
of
the
eldest
and
the
wit
of
the
youngest
it
is
true
also
that
their
defects
increased
considerably
with
their
age
the
youngest
visibly
grew
uglier
and
uglier
and
the
eldest
became
every
day
more
and
more
stupid
she
either
made
no
answer
at
all
to
what
was
asked
her
or
said
something
very
silly
she
was
with
all
this
so
unhandy
that
she
could
not
place
four
pieces
of
china
upon
the
mantlepiece
without
breaking
one
of
them
nor
drink
a
glass
of
water
without
spilling
half
of
it
upon
her
cloaths
beauty
is
a
very
great
advantage
in
young
people
yet
here
the
youngest
sister
bore
away
the
bell
almost
always
in
all
companies
from
the
eldest
people
would
indeed
go
first
to
the
beauty
to
look
upon
and
admire
her
but
turn
aside
soon
after
to
the
wit
to
hear
a
thousand
most
entertaining
and
agreeable
turns
and
it
was
amazing
to
see
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
time
the
eldest
with
not
a
soul
with
her
and
the
whole
company
crowding
about
the
youngest
the
eldest
tho
she
was
unaccountably
dull
could
not
but
notice
it
and
would
have
given
all
her
beauty
to
have
half
the
wit
of
her
sister
the
queen
prudent
as
she
was
could
not
help
reproaching
her
several
times
which
had
like
to
have
made
this
poor
princess
die
for
grief
one
day
as
she
retired
into
the
wood
to
bewail
her
misfortune
she
saw
coming
to
her
a
little
man
very
disagreeable
but
most
magnificently
dressed
this
was
the
young
prince
riquet
with
the
tuft
who
having
fallen
in
love
with
her
by
seeing
her
picture
many
of
which
went
all
the
world
over
had
left
his
father
kingdom
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
and
talking
with
her
overjoyed
to
find
her
thus
all
alone
he
addressed
himself
to
her
with
all
imaginable
politeness
and
respect
having
observed
after
he
had
made
her
the
ordinary
compliments
that
she
was
extremely
melancholy
he
said
to
her
i
can
not
comprehend
madam
how
a
person
so
beautiful
as
you
are
can
be
so
sorrowful
as
you
seem
to
be
for
tho
i
can
boast
of
having
seen
infinite
numbers
of
ladies
exquisitely
charming
i
can
say
that
i
never
beheld
any
one
whose
beauty
approaches
yours
you
are
pleased
to
say
so
answered
the
princess
and
here
she
stopped
beauty
replied
riquet
with
the
tuft
is
such
a
great
advantage
that
it
ought
to
take
the
place
of
all
things
and
since
you
possess
this
treasure
i
see
nothing
that
can
possibly
very
much
afflict
you
i
had
far
rather
cried
the
princess
be
as
ugly
as
you
are
and
have
wit
than
have
the
beauty
i
possess
and
be
so
stupid
as
i
am
there
is
nothing
madam
returned
he
shews
more
that
we
have
wit
than
to
believe
we
have
none
and
it
is
the
nature
of
that
excellent
quality
that
the
more
people
have
of
it
the
more
they
believe
they
want
it
i
do
not
know
that
said
the
princess
but
i
know
very
well
that
i
am
very
senseless
and
thence
proceeds
the
vexation
which
almost
kills
me
if
that
be
all
madam
which
troubles
you
i
can
very
easily
put
an
end
to
your
affliction
and
how
will
you
do
that
cried
the
princess
i
have
the
power
madam
replied
riquet
with
the
tuft
to
give
to
that
person
whom
i
shall
love
best
as
much
wit
as
can
be
had
and
as
you
madam
are
that
very
person
it
will
be
your
fault
only
if
you
have
not
as
great
a
share
of
it
as
any
one
living
provided
you
will
be
pleased
to
marry
me
the
princess
remained
quite
astonished
and
answered
not
a
word
illustration
the
prince
believed
he
had
given
her
more
wit
than
he
had
reserved
for
himself
i
see
replied
riquet
with
the
tuft
that
this
proposal
makes
you
very
uneasy
and
i
do
not
wonder
at
it
but
i
will
give
you
a
whole
year
to
consider
of
it
the
princess
had
so
little
wit
and
at
the
same
time
so
great
a
longing
to
have
some
that
she
imagined
the
end
of
that
year
would
never
be
therefore
she
accepted
the
proposal
which
was
made
her
she
had
no
sooner
promised
riquet
with
the
tuft
that
she
would
marry
him
on
that
day
twelvemonth
than
she
found
herself
quite
otherwise
than
she
was
before
she
had
an
incredible
facility
of
speaking
whatever
she
pleased
after
a
polite
easy
and
natural
manner
she
began
that
moment
a
very
gallant
conversation
with
riquet
with
the
tuft
wherein
she
tattled
at
such
a
rate
that
riquet
with
the
tuft
believed
he
had
given
her
more
wit
than
he
had
reserved
for
himself
when
she
returned
to
the
palace
the
whole
court
knew
not
what
to
think
of
such
a
sudden
and
extraordinary
change
for
they
heard
from
her
now
as
much
sensible
discourse
and
as
many
infinitely
witty
turns
as
they
had
stupid
and
silly
impertinences
before
the
whole
court
was
overjoyed
at
it
beyond
imagination
it
pleased
all
but
her
younger
sister
because
having
no
longer
the
advantage
of
her
in
respect
of
wit
she
appeared
in
comparison
of
her
a
very
disagreeable
homely
puss
the
king
governed
himself
by
her
advice
and
would
even
sometimes
hold
a
council
in
her
apartment
the
noise
of
this
change
spreading
every
where
all
the
young
princes
of
the
neighbouring
kingdoms
strove
all
they
could
to
gain
her
favour
and
almost
all
of
them
asked
her
in
marriage
but
she
found
not
one
of
them
had
wit
enough
for
her
and
she
gave
them
all
a
hearing
but
would
not
engage
herself
to
any
however
there
came
one
so
powerful
rich
witty
and
handsome
that
she
could
not
help
having
a
good
inclination
for
him
her
father
perceived
it
and
told
her
that
she
was
her
own
mistress
as
to
the
choice
of
a
husband
and
that
she
might
declare
her
intentions
as
the
more
wit
we
have
the
greater
difficulty
we
find
to
make
a
firm
resolution
upon
such
affairs
this
made
her
desire
her
father
after
having
thanked
him
to
give
her
time
to
consider
of
it
she
went
accidentally
to
walk
in
the
same
wood
where
she
met
riquet
with
the
tuft
to
think
the
more
conveniently
what
she
ought
to
do
while
she
was
walking
in
a
profound
meditation
she
heard
a
confused
noise
under
her
feet
as
it
were
of
a
great
many
people
who
went
backwards
and
forwards
and
were
very
busy
having
listened
more
attentively
she
heard
one
say
bring
me
that
pot
another
give
me
that
kettle
and
a
third
put
some
wood
upon
the
fire
the
ground
at
the
same
time
opened
and
she
seemingly
saw
under
her
feet
a
great
kitchen
full
of
cooks
scullions
and
all
sorts
of
servants
necessary
for
a
magnificent
entertainment
there
came
out
of
it
a
company
of
roasters
to
the
number
of
twenty
or
thirty
who
went
to
plant
themselves
in
a
fine
alley
of
wood
about
a
very
long
table
with
their
larding
pins
in
their
hands
and
skewers
in
their
caps
who
began
to
work
keeping
time
to
the
tune
of
a
very
harmonious
song
the
princess
all
astonished
at
this
sight
asked
them
who
they
worked
for
for
prince
riquet
with
the
tuft
said
the
chief
of
them
who
is
to
be
married
the
princess
was
more
surprised
than
ever
and
recollecting
that
it
was
now
that
day
twelvemonth
on
which
she
had
promised
to
marry
riquet
with
the
tuft
she
was
like
to
sink
into
the
ground
what
made
her
forget
this
was
that
when
she
made
this
promise
she
was
very
silly
and
having
obtained
that
vast
stock
of
wit
which
the
prince
had
bestowed
on
her
she
had
intirely
forgot
her
stupidity
she
continued
walking
but
had
not
taken
thirty
steps
before
riquet
with
the
tuft
presented
himself
to
her
bravely
and
most
magnificently
dressed
like
a
prince
who
was
going
to
be
married
you
see
madam
said
he
i
am
very
exact
in
keeping
my
word
and
doubt
not
in
the
least
but
you
are
come
hither
to
perform
yours
and
to
make
me
by
giving
me
your
hand
the
happiest
of
men
i
shall
freely
own
to
you
answered
the
princess
that
i
have
not
yet
taken
any
resolution
on
this
affair
and
believe
i
never
shall
take
such
a
one
as
you
desire
you
astonish
me
madam
said
riquet
with
the
tuft
i
believe
it
said
the
princess
and
surely
if
i
had
to
do
with
a
clown
or
a
man
of
no
wit
i
should
find
myself
very
much
at
a
loss
princess
always
observes
her
word
would
he
say
to
me
you
must
marry
me
since
you
promised
to
do
so
but
as
he
whom
i
talk
to
is
the
man
of
the
world
who
is
master
of
the
greatest
sense
and
judgment
i
am
sure
he
will
hear
reason
you
know
that
when
i
was
but
a
fool
i
could
notwithstanding
never
come
to
a
resolution
to
marry
you
why
will
you
have
me
now
i
have
so
much
judgment
as
you
gave
me
and
which
makes
me
a
more
difficult
person
than
i
was
at
that
time
to
come
to
such
a
resolution
which
i
could
not
then
determine
to
agree
to
if
you
sincerely
thought
to
make
me
your
wife
you
have
been
greatly
in
the
wrong
to
deprive
me
of
my
dull
simplicity
and
make
me
see
things
much
more
clearly
than
i
did
if
a
man
of
no
wit
and
sense
replied
riquet
with
the
tuft
would
be
entitled
as
you
say
to
reproach
you
for
breach
of
your
word
why
will
you
not
let
me
madam
do
likewise
in
a
matter
wherein
all
the
happiness
of
my
life
is
concerned
is
it
reasonable
that
persons
of
wit
and
sense
should
be
in
a
worse
condition
than
those
who
have
none
can
you
pretend
this
you
who
have
so
great
a
share
and
desired
so
earnestly
to
have
it
but
let
us
come
to
fact
if
you
please
setting
aside
my
ugliness
and
deformity
is
there
any
thing
in
me
which
displeases
you
are
you
dissatisfied
with
my
birth
my
wit
humour
or
manners
illustration
riquet
with
the
tuft
appeared
to
her
the
finest
prince
upon
earth
not
at
all
answered
the
princess
i
love
you
and
respect
you
in
all
that
you
mention
if
it
be
so
said
riquet
with
the
tuft
i
am
like
to
be
happy
since
it
is
in
your
power
to
make
me
the
most
lovable
of
men
how
can
that
be
said
the
princess
it
will
come
about
said
riquet
with
the
tuft
if
you
love
me
enough
to
wish
it
to
be
so
and
that
you
may
no
ways
doubt
madam
of
what
i
say
know
that
the
same
fairy
who
on
my
gave
me
for
gift
the
power
of
making
the
person
who
should
please
me
extremely
witty
and
judicious
has
in
like
manner
given
you
for
gift
the
power
of
making
him
whom
you
love
and
would
grant
that
favour
to
extremely
handsome
if
it
be
so
said
the
princess
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
you
may
be
the
most
lovable
prince
in
the
world
and
i
bestow
it
on
you
as
much
as
i
am
able
the
princess
had
no
sooner
pronounced
these
words
but
riquet
with
the
tuft
appeared
to
her
the
finest
prince
upon
earth
the
handsomest
and
most
amiable
man
she
ever
saw
some
affirm
that
it
was
not
the
enchantments
of
the
fairy
which
worked
this
change
but
that
love
alone
caused
the
metamorphosis
they
say
that
the
princess
having
made
due
reflection
on
the
perseverance
of
her
lover
his
discretion
and
all
the
good
qualities
of
his
mind
his
wit
and
judgment
saw
no
longer
the
deformity
of
his
body
nor
the
ugliness
of
his
face
that
his
hump
seemed
to
her
no
more
than
the
homely
air
of
one
who
has
a
broad
back
and
that
whereas
till
then
she
saw
him
limp
horribly
she
found
it
nothing
more
than
a
certain
sidling
air
which
charmed
her
they
say
farther
that
his
eyes
which
were
very
squinting
seemed
to
her
all
the
more
bright
and
sparkling
that
their
irregularity
passed
in
her
judgment
for
a
mark
of
a
violent
excess
of
love
and
in
short
that
his
great
red
nose
had
in
her
opinion
somewhat
of
the
martial
and
heroic

little
thumb
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
returned
that
same
night
with
the
news
little
thumb
there
was
once
upon
a
time
a
man
and
his
wife
by
trade
who
had
seven
children
all
boys
the
eldest
was
but
ten
years
old
and
the
youngest
only
seven
one
might
wonder
how
that
the
could
have
so
many
children
in
so
little
a
time
but
it
was
because
his
wife
went
nimbly
about
her
business
and
never
brought
fewer
than
two
at
a
birth
they
were
very
poor
and
their
seven
children
incommoded
them
greatly
because
not
one
of
them
was
able
to
earn
his
bread
that
which
gave
them
yet
more
uneasiness
was
that
the
youngest
was
of
a
very
puny
constitution
and
scarce
ever
spake
a
word
which
made
them
take
that
for
stupidity
which
was
a
sign
of
good
sense
he
was
very
little
and
when
born
no
bigger
than
one
thumb
which
made
him
be
called
little
thumb
the
poor
child
bore
the
blame
of
whatsoever
was
done
amiss
in
the
house
and
guilty
or
not
was
always
in
the
wrong
he
was
notwithstanding
more
cunning
and
had
a
far
greater
share
of
wisdom
than
all
his
brothers
put
together
and
if
he
spake
little
he
heard
and
thought
the
more
there
happened
now
to
come
a
very
bad
year
and
the
famine
was
so
great
that
these
poor
people
resolved
to
rid
themselves
of
their
children
one
evening
when
they
were
all
in
bed
and
the
was
sitting
with
his
wife
at
the
fire
he
said
to
her
with
his
heart
ready
to
burst
with
grief
thou
plainly
that
we
are
not
able
to
keep
our
children
and
i
can
not
see
them
starve
to
death
before
my
face
i
am
resolved
to
lose
them
in
the
wood
which
may
very
easily
be
done
for
while
they
are
busy
in
tying
up
the
faggots
we
may
run
away
and
leave
them
without
their
taking
any
notice
ah
cried
out
his
wife
and
thou
thyself
have
the
heart
to
take
thy
children
out
along
with
thee
on
purpose
to
lose
them
in
vain
did
her
husband
represent
to
her
their
extreme
poverty
she
would
not
consent
to
it
she
was
indeed
poor
but
she
was
their
mother
however
having
considered
what
a
grief
it
would
be
to
her
to
see
them
perish
with
hunger
she
at
last
consented
and
went
to
bed
all
in
tears
little
thumb
heard
every
word
that
had
been
spoken
for
observing
as
he
lay
in
his
bed
that
they
were
talking
very
busily
he
had
got
up
softly
and
hid
himself
under
his
father
stool
that
he
might
hear
what
they
said
without
being
seen
he
went
to
bed
again
but
did
not
sleep
a
wink
all
the
rest
of
the
night
thinking
on
what
he
ought
to
do
he
got
up
early
in
the
morning
and
went
to
the
river
side
where
he
filled
his
pockets
full
of
small
white
pebbles
and
then
returned
home
they
all
went
abroad
but
little
thumb
never
told
his
brothers
one
syllable
of
what
he
knew
they
went
into
a
very
thick
forest
where
they
could
not
see
one
another
at
ten
paces
distance
the
began
to
cut
wood
and
the
children
to
gather
up
sticks
to
make
faggots
their
father
and
mother
seeing
them
busy
at
their
work
got
from
them
by
degrees
and
then
ran
away
from
them
all
at
once
along
a
thro
the
winding
bushes

he
brought
them
home
by
the
very
same
way
they
came
when
the
children
saw
they
were
left
alone
they
began
to
cry
as
loud
as
they
could
little
thumb
let
them
cry
on
knowing
very
well
how
to
go
home
again
for
as
he
came
he
had
taken
care
to
drop
all
along
the
way
the
little
white
pebbles
he
had
in
his
pockets
then
said
he
to
them
be
not
afraid
brothers
father
and
mother
have
left
us
here
but
i
will
lead
you
home
again
only
follow
me
they
did
so
and
he
brought
them
home
by
the
very
same
way
they
came
into
the
forest
they
dared
not
to
go
in
but
sat
themselves
down
at
the
door
listening
to
what
their
father
and
mother
were
saying
the
very
moment
the
and
his
wife
were
got
home
the
lord
of
the
manor
sent
them
ten
crowns
which
he
had
owed
them
a
long
while
and
which
they
never
expected
this
gave
them
new
life
for
the
poor
people
were
almost
famished
the
sent
his
wife
immediately
to
the
butcher
as
it
was
a
long
while
since
they
had
eaten
a
bit
she
bought
thrice
as
much
meat
as
would
sup
two
people
having
filled
their
bellies
the
woman
said
alas
where
are
now
our
poor
children
they
would
make
a
good
feast
of
what
we
have
left
here
but
then
it
was
you
william
who
had
a
mind
to
lose
them
i
told
you
we
should
repent
of
it
what
are
they
now
doing
in
the
forest
alas
dear
god
the
wolves
have
perhaps
already
eaten
them
up
thou
art
very
inhuman
thus
to
have
lost
thy
children

grew
at
last
quite
out
of
patience
for
she
repeated
this
above
twenty
times
that
they
should
repent
of
it
and
she
was
in
the
right
of
it
for
so
saying
he
threatened
to
beat
her
if
she
did
not
hold
her
tongue
it
was
not
that
the
was
not
perhaps
more
vexed
than
his
wife
but
that
she
teized
him
and
that
he
was
of
the
humour
of
a
great
many
others
who
love
wives
who
speak
right
but
think
those
very
importunate
who
are
always
in
the
right
she
was
half
drowned
in
tears
crying
out
alas
where
are
now
my
children
my
poor
children
she
spake
this
so
very
loud
that
the
children
who
were
at
the
door
began
to
cry
out
all
together
here
we
are
here
we
are
she
ran
immediately
to
open
the
door
and
said
hugging
them
i
am
glad
to
see
you
my
dear
children
you
are
very
hungry
and
weary
and
my
poor
peter
thou
art
horribly
bemired
come
in
and
let
me
clean
thee
now
you
must
know
that
peter
was
her
eldest
son
whom
she
loved
above
all
the
rest
because
he
was
somewhat
carrotty
as
she
herself
was
they
sat
down
to
supper
and
ate
with
such
a
good
appetite
as
pleased
both
father
and
mother
whom
they
acquainted
how
frightened
they
were
in
the
forest
speaking
almost
always
all
together
the
good
folks
were
extremely
glad
to
see
their
children
once
more
at
home
and
this
joy
continued
while
the
ten
crowns
lasted
but
when
the
money
was
all
gone
they
fell
again
into
their
former
uneasiness
and
resolved
to
lose
them
again
and
that
they
might
be
the
surer
of
doing
it
to
carry
them
at
a
much
greater
distance
than
before
they
could
not
talk
of
this
so
secretly
but
they
were
overheard
by
little
thumb
who
made
account
to
get
out
of
this
difficulty
as
well
as
the
former
but
though
he
got
up
betimes
in
the
morning
to
go
and
pick
up
some
little
pebbles
he
was
disappointed
for
he
found
the
and
was
at
a
stand
what
to
do
when
their
father
had
given
each
of
them
a
piece
of
bread
for
their
breakfast
he
fancied
he
might
make
use
of
this
bread
instead
of
the
pebbles
by
throwing
it
in
little
bits
all
along
the
way
they
should
pass
and
so
he
put
it
up
into
his
pocket
their
father
and
mother
brought
them
into
the
thickest
and
most
obscure
part
of
the
forest
when
stealing
away
into
a
they
there
left
them
little
thumb
was
not
very
uneasy
at
it
for
he
thought
he
could
easily
find
the
way
again
by
means
of
his
bread
which
he
had
scattered
all
along
as
he
came
but
he
was
very
much
surprised
when
he
could
not
find
so
much
as
one
crumb
the
birds
had
come
and
eaten
it
up
every
bit
they
were
now
in
great
affliction
for
the
farther
they
went
the
more
they
were
out
of
their
way
and
were
more
and
more
bewildered
in
the
forest
night
now
came
on
and
there
arose
a
terrible
high
wind
which
made
them
dreadfully
afraid
they
fancied
they
heard
on
every
side
of
them
the
houling
of
wolves
coming
to
eat
them
up
they
scarce
dared
to
speak
or
turn
their
heads
after
this
it
rained
very
hard
which
wet
them
to
the
skin
their
feet
slipped
at
every
step
they
took
and
they
fell
into
the
mire
whence
they
got
up
in
a
very
dirty
pickle
their
hands
were
in
a
sorry
state
little
thumb
climbed
up
to
the
top
of
a
tree
to
see
if
he
could
discover
any
thing
and
having
turned
his
head
about
on
every
side
he
saw
at
last
a
glimmering
light
like
that
of
a
candle
but
a
long
way
from
the
forest
he
came
down
and
when
upon
the
ground
he
could
see
it
no
more
which
grieved
him
sadly
however
having
walked
for
some
time
with
his
brothers
towards
that
side
on
which
he
had
seen
the
light
he
perceived
it
again
as
he
came
out
of
the
wood
they
came
at
last
to
the
house
where
this
candle
was
not
without
abundance
of
fear
for
very
often
they
lost
sight
of
it
which
happened
every
time
they
came
into
a
bottom
they
knocked
at
the
door
and
a
good
woman
came
and
open
it
she
asked
them
what
they
wished
little
thumb
told
her
they
were
poor
children
who
had
been
lost
in
the
forest
and
desired
to
lodge
there
for
god
sake
the
woman
seeing
them
so
very
pretty
began
to
weep
and
said
to
them
alas
poor
babies
whither
are
ye
come
do
ye
know
that
this
house
belongs
to
a
cruel
ogre
who
eats
up
little
children
ah
dear
madam
answered
little
thumb
who
trembled
every
joint
of
him
as
well
as
his
brothers
what
shall
we
do
to
be
sure
the
wolves
of
the
forest
will
devour
us
if
you
refuse
us
to
lie
here
and
so
we
would
rather
the
gentleman
should
eat
us
perhaps
he
will
take
pity
on
us
especially
if
you
please
to
beg
it
of
him
the
ogre
wife
who
believed
she
could
conceal
them
from
her
husband
till
morning
let
them
come
in
and
brought
them
to
warm
themselves
at
a
very
good
fire
for
there
was
a
whole
sheep
upon
the
spit
roasting
for
the
ogre
supper
as
they
began
to
be
a
little
warm
they
heard
three
or
four
great
raps
at
the
door
this
was
the
ogre
who
was
come
home
upon
this
she
hid
them
under
the
bed
and
went
to
open
the
door
the
ogre
presently
asked
if
supper
was
ready
and
the
wine
drawn
and
then
he
sat
himself
down
to
table
the
sheep
was
as
yet
all
raw
and
bloody
but
he
liked
it
the
better
for
that
he
sniffed
about
to
the
right
and
left
saying
i
smell
fresh
meat
what
you
smell
so
said
his
wife
must
be
the
calf
which
i
have
just
now
killed
and
flayed
i
smell
fresh
meat
i
tell
thee
once
more
replied
the
ogre
looking
crossly
at
his
wife
and
there
is
something
here
which
i
do
not
understand
as
he
spake
these
words
he
got
up
from
the
table
and
went
directly
to
the
bed
ah
said
he
i
see
how
thou
cheat
me
thou
cursed
woman
i
know
not
why
i
do
not
eat
up
thee
too
but
it
is
well
for
thee
that
thou
art
a
tough
old
carrion
here
is
good
game
which
comes
very
luckily
to
entertain
three
ogres
of
my
acquaintance
who
are
to
pay
me
a
visit
in
a
day
or
two
with
that
he
dragged
them
out
from
under
the
bed
one
by
one
the
poor
children
fell
upon
their
knees
and
begged
his
pardon
but
they
had
to
do
with
one
of
the
most
cruel
ogres
in
the
world
who
far
from
having
any
pity
on
them
had
already
devoured
them
with
his
eyes
he
told
his
wife
they
would
be
delicate
eating
when
tossed
up
with
good
savoury
sauce
he
then
took
a
great
knife
and
coming
up
to
these
poor
children
whetted
it
upon
a
great
which
he
held
in
his
left
hand
he
had
already
taken
hold
of
one
of
them
when
his
wife
said
to
him
what
need
you
do
it
now
it
is
time
enough
hold
your
prattling
said
the
ogre
they
will
eat
the
tenderer
but
you
have
so
much
meat
already
replied
his
wife
you
have
no
occasion
here
is
a
calf
two
sheep
and
half
a
hog
that
is
true
said
the
ogre
give
them
their
that
they
may
not
fall
away
and
put
them
to
bed
the
good
woman
was
overjoyed
at
this
and
gave
them
a
good
supper
but
they
were
so
much
afraid
they
could
not
eat
a
bit
as
for
the
ogre
he
sat
down
again
to
drink
being
highly
pleased
that
he
had
got
wherewithal
to
treat
his
friends
he
drank
a
dozen
glasses
more
than
ordinary
which
got
up
into
his
head
and
obliged
him
to
go
to
bed
the
ogre
had
seven
daughters
all
little
children
and
these
young
ogresses
had
all
of
them
very
fine
complexions
because
they
used
to
eat
fresh
meat
like
their
father
but
they
had
little
grey
eyes
quite
round
hooked
noses
wide
mouths
and
very
long
sharp
teeth
standing
at
a
good
distance
from
each
other
they
were
not
as
yet
over
and
above
mischievous
but
they
promised
very
fair
for
it
for
they
already
bit
little
children
that
they
might
suck
their
blood
they
had
been
put
to
bed
early
with
every
one
a
crown
of
gold
upon
her
head
there
was
in
the
same
chamber
another
bed
of
the
like
bigness
and
it
was
into
this
bed
the
ogre
wife
put
the
seven
little
boys
after
which
she
went
to
bed
to
her
husband
little
thumb
who
had
observed
that
the
ogre
daughters
had
crowns
of
gold
upon
their
heads
and
was
afraid
lest
the
ogre
should
repent
his
not
killing
them
got
up
about
midnight
and
taking
his
bonnets
and
his
own
went
very
softly
put
them
upon
the
heads
of
the
seven
little
ogresses
after
having
taken
off
their
crowns
of
gold
which
he
put
upon
his
own
head
and
his
brothers
that
the
ogre
might
take
them
for
his
daughters
and
his
daughters
for
the
little
boys
whom
he
wanted
to
kill
all
this
succeeded
according
to
his
desire
for
the
ogre
waking
about
midnight
and
sorry
that
he
deferred
to
do
that
till
morning
which
he
might
have
done
threw
himself
hastily
out
of
bed
and
taking
his
great
knife
let
us
see
said
he
how
our
little
rogues
do
and
not
make
two
jobs
of
the
matter
he
then
went
up
groping
all
the
way
into
his
daughters
chamber
and
came
to
the
bed
where
the
little
boys
lay
who
were
every
soul
of
them
fast
asleep
except
little
thumb
who
was
terribly
afraid
when
he
found
the
ogre
fumbling
about
his
head
as
he
had
done
about
his
brothers
the
ogre
feeling
the
golden
crowns
said
i
should
have
made
a
fine
piece
of
work
of
it
truly
i
find
i
guzzled
too
much
last
night
then
he
went
to
the
bed
where
the
girls
lay
and
having
found
the
boys
little
bonnets
hah
said
he
my
merry
lads
are
you
there
let
us
to
work
and
saying
these
words
without
more
ado
he
cut
the
throats
of
all
his
seven
daughters
well
pleased
with
what
he
had
done
he
went
to
bed
again
to
his
wife
so
soon
as
little
thumb
heard
the
ogre
snore
he
waked
his
brothers
and
bade
them
put
on
their
clothes
presently
and
follow
him
they
stole
down
softly
into
the
garden
and
got
over
the
wall
they
kept
running
almost
all
night
trembling
all
the
while
without
knowing
which
way
they
went
the
ogre
when
he
waked
said
to
his
wife
go
up
stairs
and
dress
those
young
rascals
who
came
here
last
night
the
ogress
was
very
much
surprised
at
this
goodness
of
her
husband
not
dreaming
after
what
manner
he
intended
she
should
dress
them
but
thinking
that
he
had
ordered
her
to
go
and
put
on
their
cloaths
went
up
and
was
strangely
astonished
when
she
perceived
her
seven
daughters
killed
and
weltering
in
their
blood
she
fainted
away
for
this
is
the
first
expedient
almost
all
women
find
in
cases
the
ogre
fearing
his
wife
would
be
too
long
in
doing
what
he
had
ordered
went
up
himself
to
help
her
he
was
no
less
amazed
than
his
wife
at
this
frightful
spectacle
ah
what
have
i
done
cried
he
the
cursed
wretches
shall
pay
for
it
and
that
instantly
he
threw
then
a
pitcher
of
water
upon
his
wife
face
and
having
brought
her
to
herself
give
me
quickly
cried
he
my
boots
of
seven
leagues
that
i
may
go
and
catch
them
he
went
out
and
having
run
over
a
vast
deal
of
ground
both
on
this
side
and
that
he
came
at
last
into
the
very
road
where
the
poor
children
were
and
not
above
a
hundred
paces
from
their
house
they
espied
the
ogre
who
went
at
one
step
from
mountain
to
mountain
and
over
rivers
as
easily
as
the
narrowest
kennels
little
thumb
seeing
a
hollow
rock
near
the
place
where
they
were
made
his
brothers
hide
themselves
in
it
and
crowded
into
it
himself
minding
always
what
would
become
of
the
ogre
footnote
that
is
the
ogre
who
found
himself
much
tired
with
his
long
and
fruitless
journey
for
these
boots
of
seven
leagues
extremely
fatigue
the
wearer
had
a
great
mind
to
rest
himself
and
by
chance
went
to
sit
down
upon
the
rock
where
these
little
boys
had
hid
themselves
as
he
was
worn
out
he
fell
asleep
and
after
reposing
himself
some
time
he
began
to
snore
so
frightfully
that
the
poor
children
were
no
less
afraid
of
him
than
when
he
held
up
his
great
knife
and
was
going
to
cut
their
throats
little
thumb
was
not
so
much
frightened
as
his
brothers
and
told
them
that
they
should
run
away
immediately
towards
home
while
the
ogre
was
asleep
so
soundly
and
that
they
should
not
be
anxious
about
him
they
took
his
advice
and
got
home
presently
little
thumb
came
up
to
the
ogre
pulled
off
his
boots
gently
and
put
them
on
upon
his
own
legs
the
boots
were
very
long
and
large
but
as
they
were
fairies
they
had
the
gift
of
becoming
big
and
little
according
to
the
legs
of
those
who
wore
them
so
that
they
fitted
his
feet
and
legs
as
well
as
if
they
had
been
made
on
purpose
for
him
he
went
immediately
to
the
ogre
house
where
he
saw
his
wife
crying
bitterly
for
the
loss
of
her
murdered
daughters
your
husband
said
little
thumb
is
in
very
great
danger
being
taken
by
a
gang
of
thieves
who
have
sworn
to
kill
him
if
he
does
not
give
them
all
his
gold
and
silver
just
when
they
held
their
daggers
at
his
throat
he
perceived
me
and
desired
me
to
come
and
tell
you
the
condition
he
is
in
and
that
you
should
give
me
whatsoever
he
has
of
value
without
retaining
any
one
thing
for
otherwise
they
will
kill
him
without
mercy
and
as
his
case
is
very
pressing
he
desired
me
to
make
use
you
see
i
have
them
on
of
his
boots
that
i
might
make
the
more
haste
and
to
shew
you
that
i
do
not
impose
upon
you
the
good
woman
being
sadly
frightened
gave
him
all
she
had
for
this
ogre
was
a
very
good
husband
tho
he
used
to
eat
up
little
children
little
thumb
having
thus
got
all
the
ogre
money
came
home
to
his
father
house
where
he
was
received
with
abundance
of
joy
there
are
many
people
who
do
not
agree
in
this
circumstance
and
pretend
that
little
thumb
never
robbed
the
ogre
at
all
and
that
he
only
thought
he
might
very
justly
and
with
safe
conscience
take
off
his
boots
of
seven
leagues
because
he
made
no
other
use
of
them
but
to
run
after
little
children
these
folks
affirm
that
they
were
very
well
assured
of
this
and
the
more
as
having
drank
and
eaten
often
at
the
house
they
aver
that
when
little
thumb
had
taken
off
the
ogre
boots
he
went
to
court
where
he
was
informed
that
they
were
very
anxious
about
a
certain
army
which
was
two
hundred
leagues
off
and
the
success
of
a
battle
he
went
say
they
to
the
king
and
told
him
that
if
he
desired
it
he
would
bring
him
news
from
the
army
before
night
the
king
promised
him
a
great
sum
of
money
upon
that
condition
little
thumb
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
returned
that
very
same
night
with
the
news
and
this
first
expedition
causing
him
to
be
known
he
got
whatever
he
pleased

at

he
was

lamenting

he
was
resolved
to
seek
the
advice
of
his

was

good

had
soon
reached

befallen

conceived
many

great
astonishment
a

black
pudding
which
issuing
from
a
corner

the
hearth
came
winding

she
uttered
a
cry

fear
and
then
again
exclaimed
in
dismay
when
she
perceived
that
this
strange
occurrence
was
due
to
the
wish
which
her
husband
had
so
rashly
and
foolishly
spoken
turning
upon
him
in
her
anger
and
disappointment
she
called
the
poor

all
the
abusive
names

free
rein

her
vexation

she
continued
to
upbraid
her
husband

his
anger
also
was
stirred

he
had
wellnigh
made
a
second
bid

wished
himself

cried

who
ever

on
her
pudding

to
heaven
it
hung
at
the
end
of
her
nose
no
sooner
had
the
husband
given
voice
to
these
words
than
the
wish
was
straightway
granted
and
the
long
coil
of
black
pudding
appeared
grafted
to
the
angry
dame

our
man
paused
when
he
beheld
what
he
had
wrought
fanny
was
a
comely
young
woman
and
blest
with
good
looks
and
truth
to
tell
this
new
ornament
did
not
set
off
her
beauty
yet
it
offered
one
advantage
that
as
it
hung
right
before
her
mouth
it
would
thus
effectively
curb
her
speech
so
having
now
but
one
wish
left
he
had
all
but
resolved
to
make
good
use
of
it
without
further
delay
and
before
any
other
mischance
could
befall
to
wish
himself
a
kingdom
of
his
own
he
was
about
to
speak
the
word
when
he
was
stayed
by
a
sudden
thought
it
is
true
he
said
to
himself
that
there
is
none
so
great
as
a
king
but
what
of
the
queen
that
must
share
his
dignity
with
what
grace
would
she
sit
beside
me
on
the
throne
with
a
yard
of
black
pudding
for
a
nose
in
this
dilemma
he
resolved
to
put
the
case
to
fanny
and
to
leave
her
to
decide
whether
she
would
rather
be
a
queen
with
this
most
horrible
appendage
marring
her
good
looks
or
remain
a
peasant
wife
but
with
her
shapely
nose
relieved
of
this
untoward
addition
illustration
truth
to
tell
this
new
ornament
did
not
set
off
her
beauty
fanny
mind
was
soon
made
up
although
she
had
dreamt
of
a
crown
and
sceptre
yet
a
woman
first
wish
is
always
to
please
to
this
great
desire
all
else
must
yield
and
fanny
would
rather
be
fair
in
drugget
than
be
a
queen
with
an
ugly
face
thus
our
woodcutter
did
not
change
his
state
did
not
become
a
potentate
nor
fill
his
purse
with
golden
crowns
he
was
thankful
enough
to
use
his
remaining
wish
to
a
more
humble
purpose
and
forthwith
relieved
his
wife
of
her
encumbrance
illustration
so
it
is
that
miserable
man
by
nature
fickle
blind
unwise
and
rash
oft
fails
to
reap
a
harvest

bestowed
upon
him

once
upon

time
there
was
a
king
so
great
so
beloved
by
his
people
and
so
respected
by
all
his
neighbours
and
allies
that
one
might
almost
say
he
was
the
happiest
monarch
alive
his
good
fortune
was
made
even

by
the
choice
he
had
made
for
wife
of
a
princess
as
beautiful
as
she
was
virtuous
with
whom
he
lived
in
perfect
happiness
now
of
this
chaste
marriage
was
born
a
daughter
endowed
with
so
many
gifts
that
they
had
no
regret
because
other
children
were
not
given

them
magnificence
good
taste
and
abundance
reigned
in
the
palace
there
were
wise
and
clever
ministers
virtuous
and
devoted
courtiers
faithful
and
diligent
servants
the
spacious
stables
were
filled
with
the
most
beautiful
horses
in
the
world
and
coverts
of
rich
caparison
but
what
most
astonished
strangers
who
came
to
admire
them
was
to
see
in
the
finest
stall
a
master
donkey
with
great
long
ears
now
it
was
not
for
a
whim
but
for
a
good
reason
that
the
king
had
given
this
donkey
a
particular
and
distinguished
place
the
special
qualities
of
this
rare
animal
deserved
the
distinction
since
nature
had
made
it
in
so
extraordinary
a
way
that
its
litter
instead
of
being
like
that
of
other
donkeys
was
covered
every
morning
with
an
abundance
of
beautiful
golden
crowns
and
golden
louis
of
every
kind
which
were
collected
daily
since
the
vicissitudes
of
life
wait
on
kings
as
much
as
on
their
subjects
and
good
is
always
mingled
with
ill
it
so
befell
that
the
queen
was
suddenly
attacked
by
a
fatal
illness
and
in
spite
of
science
and
the
skill
of
the
doctors
no
remedy
could
be
found
there
was
great
mourning
throughout
the
land
the
king
who
notwithstanding
the
famous
proverb
that
marriage
is
the
tomb
of
love
was
deeply
attached
to
his
wife
was
distressed
beyond
measure
and
made
fervent
vows
to
all
the
temples
in
his
kingdom
and
offered
to
give
his
life
for
that
of
his
beloved
consort
but
he
invoked
the
gods
and
the
fairies
in
vain
the
queen
feeling
her
last
hour
approach
said
to
her
husband
who
was
dissolved
in
tears
it
is
well
that
i
should
speak
to
you
of
a
certain
matter
before
i
die
if
perchance
you
should
desire
to
marry
again
at
these
words
the
king
broke
into
piteous
cries
took
his
wife
hands
in
his
own
and
assured
her
that
it
was
useless
to
speak
to
him
of
a
second
marriage
no
my
dear
spouse
he
said
at
last
speak
to
me
rather
of
how
i
may
follow
you
the
state
continued
the
queen
with
a
finality
which
but
increased
the
laments
of
the
king
the
state
demands
successors
and
since
i
have
only
given
you
a
daughter
it
will
urge
you
to
beget
sons
who
resemble
you
but
i
ask
you
earnestly
not
to
give
way
to
the
persuasions
of
your
people
until
you
have
found
a
princess
more
beautiful
and
more
perfectly
fashioned
than
i
beg
you
to
swear
this
to
me
and
then
i
shall
die
content
perchance
the
queen
who
did
not
lack
exacted
this
oath
firmly
believing
that
there
was
not
her
equal
in
the
world
and
so
felt
assured
that
the
king
would
never
marry
again
be
this
as
it
may
at
length
she
died
and
never
did
husband
make
so
much
lamentation
the
king
wept
and
sobbed
day
and
night
and
the
punctilious
fulfilment
of
the
rites
of
even
the
smallest
was
his
sole
occupation
but
even
great
griefs
do
not
last
for
ever
after
a
time
the
magnates
of
the
state
assembled
and
came
to
the
king
urging
him
to
take
another
wife
at
first
this
request
seemed
hard
to
him
and
made
him
shed
fresh
tears
he
pleaded
the
vows
he
had
made
to
the
queen
and
defied
his
counsellors
to
find
a
princess
more
beautiful
and
better
fashioned
than
was
she
thinking
this
to
be
impossible
but
the
council
treated
the
promise
as
a
trifle
and
said
that
it
mattered
little
about
beauty
if
the
queen
were
but
virtuous
and
fruitful
for
the
state
needed
princes
for
its
peace
and
prosperity
and
though
in
truth
the
princess
his
daughter
had
all
the
qualities
requisite
for
making
a
great
queen
yet
of
necessity
she
must
choose
an
alien
for
her
husband
and
then
the
stranger
would
take
her
away
with
him
if
on
the
other
hand
he
remained
in
her
country
and
shared
the
throne
with
her
their
children
would
not
be
considered
to
be
of
pure
native
stock
and
so
there
being
no
prince
of
his
name
neighbouring
peoples
would
stir
up
wars
and
the
kingdom
would
be
ruined
the
king
impressed
by
these
considerations
promised
that
he
would
think
over
the
matter
and
so
search
was
made
among
all
the
marriageable
princesses
for
one
that
would
suit
him
every
day
charming
portraits
were
brought
him
but
none
gave
promise
of
the
beauty
of
his
late
queen
instead
of
coming
to
a
decision
he
brooded
over
his
sorrow
until
in
the
end
his
reason
left
him
in
his
delusions
he
imagined
himself
once
more
a
young
man
he
thought
the
princess
his
daughter
in
her
youth
and
beauty
was
his
queen
as
he
had
known
her
in
the
days
of
their
courtship
and
living
thus
in
the
past
he
urged
the
unhappy
girl
to
speedily
become
his
bride
the
young
princess
who
was
virtuous
and
chaste
threw
herself
at
the
feet
of
the
king
her
father
and
conjured
him
with
all
the
eloquence
she
could
command
not
to
constrain
her
to
consent
to
his
unnatural
desire
the
king
in
his
madness
could
not
understand
the
reason
of
her
desperate
reluctance
and
asked
an
old
to
set
the
conscience
of
the
princess
at
rest
now
this
druid
less
religious
than
ambitious
sacrificed
the
cause
of
innocence
and
virtue
to
the
favour
of
so
great
a
monarch
and
instead
of
trying
to
restore
the
king
to
his
right
mind
he
encouraged
him
in
his
delusion
illustration
he
thought
the
princess
was
his
queen
the
young
princess
beside
herself
with
misery
at
last
bethought
her
of
the
her
godmother
determined
to
consult
her
she
set
out
that
same
night
in
a
pretty
little
carriage
drawn
by
a
great
sheep
who
knew
all
the
roads
when
she
arrived
the
fairy
who
loved
the
princess
told
her
that
she
knew
all
she
had
come
to
say
but
that
she
need
have
no
fear
for
nothing
would
harm
her
if
only
she
faithfully
fulfilled
the
fairy
injunctions
for
my
dear
child
she
said
to
her
it
would
be
a
great
sin
to
submit
to
your
wishes
but
you
can
avoid
the
necessity
without
displeasing
him
tell
him
that
to
satisfy
a
whim
you
have
he
must
give
you
a
dress
the
colour
of
the
weather
never
in
spite
of
all
his
love
and
his
power
will
he
be
able
to
give
you
that
the
princess
thanked
her
godmother
from
her
heart
and
the
next
morning
spoke
to
the
king
as
the
fairy
had
counselled
her
and
protested
that
no
one
would
win
her
hand
unless
he
gave
her
a
dress
the
colour
of
the
weather
the
king
overjoyed
and
hopeful
called
together
the
most
skilful
workmen
and
demanded
this
robe
of
them
otherwise
they
should
be
hanged
but
he
was
saved
from
resorting
to
this
extreme
measure
since
on
the
second
day
they
brought
the
much
desired
robe
the
heavens
are
not
a
more
beautiful
blue
when
they
are
girdled
with
clouds
of
gold
than
was
that
lovely
dress
when
it
was
unfolded
the
princess
was
very
sad
because
of
it
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
once
more
she
went
to
her
who
astonished
that
her
plan
had
been
foiled
now
told
her
to
ask
for
another
gown
the
colour
of
the
moon
the
king
again
sought
out
the
most
clever
workmen
and
expressly
commanded
them
to
make
a
dress
the
colour
of
the
moon
and
woe
betide
them
if
between
the
giving
of
the
order
and
the
bringing
of
the
dress
more
than
hours
should
elapse
the
princess
though
pleased
with
the
dress
when
it
was
delivered
gave
way
to
distress
when
she
was
with
her
women
and
her
nurse
the
who
knew
all
hastened
to
comfort
her
and
said
either
i
am
greatly
deceived
or
it
is
certain
that
if
you
ask
for
a
dress
the
colour
of
the
sun
we
shall
at
last
baffle
the
king
your
father
for
it
would
never
be
possible
to
make
such
a
gown
in
any
case
we
should
gain
time
so
the
princess
asked
for
yet
another
gown
as
the
fairy
bade
her
the
infatuated
king
could
refuse
his
daughter
nothing
and
he
gave
without
regret
all
the
diamonds
and
rubies
in
his
crown
to
aid
this
superb
work
nothing
was
to
be
spared
that
could
make
the
dress
as
beautiful
as
the
sun
and
indeed
when
the
dress
appeared
all
those
who
unfolded
it
were
obliged
to
close
their
eyes
so
much
were
they
dazzled
and
truth
to
tell
green
spectacles
and
smoked
glasses
date
from
that
time
what
was
the
princess
to
do
never
had
so
beautiful
and
so
artistic
a
robe
been
seen
she
was
and
pretending
that
its
brilliance
had
hurt
her
eyes
she
retired
to
her
chamber
where
she
found
the
fairy
awaiting
her
on
seeing
the
dress
like
the
sun
the
became
red
with
rage
oh
this
time
my
child
she
said
to
the
princess
we
will
put
the
king
to
terrible
proof
in
spite
of
his
madness
i
think
he
will
be
a
little
astonished
by
the
request
that
i
counsel
you
to
make
of
him
it
is
that
he
should
give
you
the
skin
of
that
ass
he
loves
so
dearly
and
which
supplies
him
so
profusely
with
the
means
of
paying
all
his
expenses
go
and
do
not
fail
to
tell
him
that
you
want
this
skin
the
princess
overjoyed
at
finding
yet
another
avenue
of
escape
for
she
thought
that
her
father
could
never
bring
himself
to
sacrifice
the
ass
went
to
find
him
and
unfolded
to
him
her
latest
desire
although
the
king
was
astonished
by
this
whim
he
did
not
hesitate
to
satisfy
it
the
poor
ass
was
sacrificed
and
the
skin
brought
with
due
ceremony
to
the
princess
who
seeing
no
other
way
of
avoiding
her
was
desperate
at
that
moment
her
godmother
arrived
what
are
you
doing
my
child
she
asked
seeing
the
princess
tearing
her
hair
her
beautiful
cheeks
stained
with
tears
this
is
the
most
happy
moment
of
your
life
wrap
yourself
in
this
skin
leave
the
palace
and
walk
so
long
as
you
can
find
ground
to
carry
you
when
one
sacrifices
everything
to
virtue
the
gods
know
how
to
mete
out
reward
go
and
i
will
take
care
that
your
possessions
follow
you
in
whatever
place
you
rest
your
chest
with
your
clothes
and
your
jewels
will
follow
your
steps
and
here
is
my
wand
which
i
will
give
you
tap
the
ground
with
it
when
you
have
need
of
the
chest
and
it
will
appear
before
your
eyes
but
haste
to
set
forth
and
do
not
delay
the
princess
embraced
her
godmother
many
times
and
begged
her
not
to
forsake
her
then
after
she
had
smeared
herself
with
soot
from
the
chimney
she
wrapped
herself
up
in
that
ugly
skin
and
went
out
from
the
magnificent
palace
without
being
recognised
by
a
single
person
the
absence
of
the
princess
caused
a
great
commotion
the
king
who
had
caused
a
sumptuous
banquet
to
be
prepared
was
inconsolable
he
sent
out
more
than
a
hundred
gendarmes
and
more
than
a
thousand
musketeers
in
quest
of
her
but
the
made
her
invisible
to
the
cleverest
seekers
and
thus
she
escaped
their
vigilance
meanwhile
the
princess
walked
far
far
and
even
farther
away
after
a
time
she
sought
for
a
resting
place
but
although
out
of
charity
people
gave
her
food
she
was
so
dishevelled
and
dirty
that
no
one
wanted
to
keep
her
at
length
she
came
to
a
beautiful
town
at
the
gate
of
which
was
a
small
farm
now
the
farmer
wife
had
need
of
a
wench
to
wash
the
dishes
and
to
attend
to
the
geese
and
the
pigs
and
seeing
so
dirty
a
vagrant
offered
to
engage
her
the
princess
who
was
now
much
fatigued
accepted
joyfully
she
was
put
into
a
recess
in
the
kitchen
where
for
the
first
days
she
was
subjected
to
the
coarse
jokes
of
the
so
dirty
and
unpleasant
did
the
make
her
appear
at
last
they
tired
of
their
pleasantries
moreover
she
was
so
attentive
to
her
work
that
the
farmer
wife
took
her
under
her
protection
she
minded
the
sheep
and
penned
them
up
when
it
was
necessary
and
she
took
the
geese
out
to
feed
with
such
intelligence
that
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
never
done
anything
else
everything
that
her
beautiful
hands
undertook
was
done
well
one
day
she
was
sitting
near
a
clear
fountain
where
she
often
repaired
to
bemoan
her
sad
condition
when
she
thought
she
would
look
at
herself
in
the
water
the
horrible
which
covered
her
from
head
to
toe
revolted
her
ashamed
she
washed
her
face
and
her
hands
which
became
whiter
than
ivory
and
once
again
her
lovely
complexion
took
its
natural
freshness
the
joy
of
finding
herself
so
beautiful
filled
her
with
the
desire
to
bathe
in
the
pool
and
this
she
did
but
she
had
to
don
her
unworthy
skin
again
before
she
returned
to
the
farm
by
good
fortune
the
next
day
chanced
to
be
a
holiday
and
so
she
had
leisure
to
tap
for
her
chest
with
the
fairy
wand
arrange
her
toilet
powder
her
beautiful
hair
and
put
on
the
lovely
gown
which
was
the
colour
of
the
weather
but
the
room
was
so
small
that
the
train
could
not
be
properly
spread
out
the
beautiful
princess
looked
at
herself
and
with
good
reason
admired
her
appearance
so
much
that
she
resolved
to
wear
her
magnificent
dresses
in
turn
on
holidays
and
sundays
for
her
own
amusement
and
this
she
regularly
did
she
entwined
flowers
and
diamonds
in
her
lovely
hair
with
admirable
art
and
often
she
sighed
that
she
had
no
witness
of
her
beauty
save
the
sheep
and
geese
who
loved
her
just
as
much
in
the
horrible
after
which
she
had
been
named
at
the
farm
one
holiday
when
had
put
on
her
dress
the
son
of
the
king
to
whom
the
farm
belonged
alighted
there
to
rest
on
his
return
from
the
hunt
this
prince
was
young
and
handsome
beloved
of
his
father
and
of
the
queen
his
mother
and
adored
by
the
people
after
he
had
partaken
of
the
simple
collation
which
was
offered
him
he
set
out
to
inspect
the
and
all
its
nooks
and
corners
in
going
thus
from
place
to
place
he
entered
a
dark
alley
at
the
bottom
of
which
was
a
closed
door
curiosity
made
him
put
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
imagine
his
astonishment
at
seeing
a
princess
so
beautiful
and
so
richly
dressed
and
withal
of
so
noble
and
dignified
a
mien
that
he
took
her
to
be
a
divinity
the
impetuosity
of
his
feelings
at
this
moment
would
have
made
him
force
the
door
had
it
not
been
for
the
respect
with
which
that
charming
figure
filled
him
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
withdrew
from
this
gloomy
little
alley
intent
on
discovering
who
the
inmate
of
the
tiny
room
might
be
he
was
told
that
it
was
a
scullion
called
because
of
the
skin
which
she
always
wore
and
that
she
was
so
dirty
and
unpleasant
that
no
one
took
any
notice
of
her
or
even
spoke
to
her
she
had
just
been
taken
out
of
pity
to
look
after
the
geese
illustration
curiosity
made
him
put
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
the
prince
though
little
satisfied
by
this
information
saw
that
these
dense
people
knew
no
more
and
that
it
was
useless
to
question
them
so
he
returned
to
the
palace
of
the
king
his
father
beyond
words
in
love
having
continually
before
his
eyes
the
beautiful
image
of
the
goddess
whom
he
had
seen
through
the
keyhole
he
was
full
of
regret
that
he
had
not
knocked
at
the
door
and
promised
himself
that
he
would
not
fail
to
do
so
next
time
but
the
fervency
of
his
love
caused
him
such
great
agitation
that
the
same
night
he
was
seized
by
a
terrible
fever
and
was
soon
at
death
door
the
queen
who
had
no
other
child
was
in
despair
because
all
remedies
proved
useless
in
vain
she
promised
great
rewards
to
the
doctors
though
they
exerted
all
their
skill
nothing
would
cure
the
prince
at
last
they
decided
that
some
great
sorrow
had
caused
this
terrible
fever
they
told
the
queen
who
full
of
tenderness
for
her
son
went
to
him
and
begged
him
to
tell
her
his
trouble
she
declared
that
even
if
it
was
a
matter
of
giving
him
the
crown
his
father
would
yield
the
throne
to
him
without
regret
or
if
he
desired
some
princess
even
though
there
should
be
war
with
the
king
her
father
and
their
subjects
should
with
reason
complain
all
should
be
sacrificed
to
obtain
what
he
wished
she
implored
him
with
tears
not
to
die
since
their
life
depended
on
his
the
queen
did
not
finish
this
touching
discourse
without
moving
the
prince
to
tears
madam
he
said
at
last
in
a
very
feeble
voice
i
am
not
so
base
that
i
desire
the
crown
of
my
father
rather
may
heaven
grant
him
life
for
many
years
and
that
i
may
always
be
the
most
faithful
and
the
most
respectful
of
his
subjects
as
to
the
princesses
that
you
speak
of
i
have
never
yet
thought
of
marriage
and
you
well
know
that
subject
as
i
am
to
your
wishes
i
shall
obey
you
always
even
though
it
be
painful
to
me
ah
my
son
replied
the
queen
we
will
spare
nothing
to
save
your
life
but
my
dear
child
save
mine
and
that
of
the
king
your
father
by
telling
me
what
you
desire
and
be
assured
that
you
shall
have
it
well
madam
he
said
since
you
would
have
me
tell
you
my
thought
i
obey
you
it
would
indeed
be
a
sin
to
place
in
danger
two
lives
so
dear
to
me
know
my
mother
that
i
wish
to
make
me
a
cake
and
to
have
it
brought
to
me
when
it
is
ready
the
queen
astonished
at
this
strange
name
asked
who
might
be
it
is
madam
replied
one
of
her
officers
who
had
by
chance
seen
this
girl
it
is
the
most
ugly
creature
imaginable
after
the
wolf
a
slut
who
lodges
at
your
farm
and
minds
your
geese
it
matters
not
said
the
queen
my
son
on
his
way
home
from
the
chase
has
perchance
eaten
of
her
cakes
it
is
a
whim
such
as
those
who
are
sick
do
sometimes
have
in
a
word
i
wish
that
since
it
is
make
him
presently
a
cake
a
messenger
ran
to
the
farm
and
told
that
she
was
to
make
a
cake
for
the
prince
as
well
as
she
possibly
could
now
some
believe
that
had
been
aware
of
the
prince
in
her
heart
at
the
moment
when
he
had
put
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
and
then
looking
from
her
little
window
she
had
seen
him
so
young
so
handsome
and
so
shapely
that
the
remembrance
of
him
had
remained
and
that
often
the
thought
of
him
had
cost
her
some
sighs
be
that
as
it
may
either
having
seen
him
or
having
heard
him
spoken
of
with
praise
was
overjoyed
to
think
that
she
might
become
known
to
him
she
shut
herself
in
her
little
room
threw
off
the
ugly
skin
bathed
her
face
and
hands
arranged
her
hair
put
on
a
beautiful
corsage
of
bright
silver
and
an
equally
beautiful
petticoat
and
then
set
herself
to
make
the
much
desired
cake
she
took
the
finest
flour
and
newest
eggs
and
freshest
butter
and
while
she
was
working
them
whether
by
design
or
no
a
ring
which
she
had
on
her
finger
fell
into
the
cake
and
was
mixed
in
it
when
the
cooking
was
done
she
muffled
herself
in
her
horrible
skin
and
gave
the
cake
to
the
messenger
asking
him
for
news
of
the
prince
but
the
man
would
not
deign
to
reply
and
without
a
word
ran
quickly
back
to
the
palace
the
prince
took
the
cake
greedily
from
the
man
hands
and
ate
it
with
such
voracity
that
the
doctors
who
were
present
did
not
fail
to
say
that
this
haste
was
not
a
good
sign
indeed
the
prince
came
near
to
being
choked
by
the
ring
which
he
nearly
swallowed
in
one
of
the
pieces
of
cake
but
he
drew
it
cleverly
from
his
mouth
and
his
desire
for
the
cake
was
forgotten
as
he
examined
the
fine
emerald
set
in
a
gold
a
ring
so
small
that
he
knew
it
could
only
be
worn
on
the
prettiest
little
finger
in
the
world
he
kissed
the
ring
a
thousand
times
put
it
under
his
pillow
and
drew
it
out
every
moment
that
he
thought
himself
unobserved
the
torment
that
he
gave
himself
planning
how
he
might
see
her
to
whom
the
ring
belonged
not
daring
to
believe
that
if
he
asked
for
she
would
be
allowed
to
come
and
not
daring
to
speak
of
what
he
had
seen
through
the
keyhole
for
fear
that
he
would
be
laughed
at
for
a
dreamer
brought
back
the
fever
with
great
violence
the
doctors
not
knowing
what
more
to
do
declared
to
the
queen
that
the
malady
was
love
whereupon
the
queen
and
the
disconsolate
king
ran
to
their
son
my
son
my
dear
son
cried
the
affected
monarch
tell
us
the
name
of
her
whom
you
desire
we
swear
that
we
will
give
her
to
you
even
though
she
were
the
vilest
of
slaves
the
queen
embracing
him
agreed
with
all
that
the
king
had
said
and
the
prince
moved
by
their
tears
and
caresses
said
to
them
my
father
and
my
mother
i
in
no
way
desire
to
make
a
marriage
which
is
displeasing
to
you
and
drawing
the
emerald
from
under
his
pillow
he
added
to
prove
the
truth
of
this
i
desire
to
marry
her
to
whom
this
ring
belongs
it
is
not
likely
that
she
who
owns
so
pretty
a
ring
is
a
rustic
or
a
peasant
the
king
and
the
queen
took
the
ring
examined
it
with
great
curiosity
and
agreed
with
the
prince
that
it
could
only
belong
to
the
daughter
of
a
good
house
then
the
king
having
embraced
his
son
and
entreated
him
to
get
well
went
out
he
ordered
the
drums
and
fifes
and
trumpets
to
be
sounded
throughout
the
town
and
the
heralds
to
cry
that
she
whose
finger
a
certain
ring
would
fit
should
marry
the
heir
to
the
throne
first
the
princesses
arrived
then
the
duchesses
and
the
marquises
and
the
baronesses
but
though
they
did
all
they
could
to
make
their
fingers
small
none
could
put
on
the
ring
so
the
country
girls
had
to
be
tried
but
pretty
though
they
all
were
they
all
had
fingers
that
were
too
fat
the
prince
who
was
feeling
better
made
the
trial
himself
at
last
it
was
the
turn
of
the
but
they
succeeded
no
better
then
when
everyone
else
had
tried
the
prince
asked
for
the
the
scullions
and
the
they
were
all
brought
to
the
palace
but
their
coarse
red
short
fingers
would
hardly
go
through
the
golden
hoop
as
far
as
the
nail
you
have
not
brought
that
who
made
me
the
cake
said
the
prince
everyone
laughed
and
said
no
so
dirty
and
unpleasant
was
she
let
someone
fetch
her
at
once
said
the
king
it
shall
not
be
said
that
i
left
out
the
lowliest
and
the
servants
ran
laughing
and
mocking
to
find
the
the
princess
who
had
heard
the
drums
and
the
cries
of
the
heralds
had
no
doubt
that
the
ring
was
the
cause
of
this
uproar
now
she
loved
the
prince
and
as
true
love
is
timorous
and
has
no
vanity
she
was
in
perpetual
fear
that
some
other
lady
would
be
found
to
have
a
finger
as
small
as
hers
great
then
was
her
joy
when
the
messengers
came
and
knocked
at
her
door
since
she
knew
that
they
were
seeking
the
owner
of
the
right
finger
on
which
to
set
her
ring
some
impulse
had
moved
her
to
arrange
her
hair
with
great
care
and
to
put
on
her
beautiful
silver
corsage
and
the
petticoat
full
of
furbelows
and
silver
lace
studded
with
emeralds
at
the
first
knock
she
quickly
covered
her
finery
with
the
and
opened
the
door
the
visitors
in
derision
told
her
that
the
king
had
sent
for
her
in
order
to
marry
her
to
his
son
then
with
loud
peals
of
laughter
they
led
her
to
the
prince
who
was
astonished
at
the
garb
of
this
girl
and
dared
not
believe
that
it
was
she
whom
he
had
seen
so
majestic
and
so
beautiful
sad
and
confounded
he
said
is
it
you
who
lodge
at
the
bottom
of
that
dark
alley
in
the
third
yard
of
the
farm
yes
your
highness
she
replied
show
me
your
hand
said
the
prince
trembling
and
heaving
a
deep
sigh
imagine
how
astonished
everyone
was
the
king
and
the
queen
the
chamberlains
and
all
the
courtiers
were
when
from
beneath
that
black
and
dirty
skin
came
a
delicate
little
white
and
hand
and
the
ring
slipped
without
difficulty
on
to
the
prettiest
little
finger
in
the
world
then
by
a
little
movement
which
the
princess
made
the
skin
fell
from
her
shoulders
and
so
enchanting
was
her
guise
that
the
prince
weak
though
he
was
fell
on
his
knees
and
held
her
so
closely
that
she
blushed
but
that
was
scarcely
noticed
for
the
king
and
queen
came
to
embrace
her
heartily
and
to
ask
her
if
she
would
marry
their
son
the
princess
confused
by
all
these
caresses
and
by
the
love
of
the
handsome
young
prince
was
about
to
thank
them
when
suddenly
the
ceiling
opened
and
the
descended
in
a
chariot
made
of
the
branches
and
flowers
from
which
she
took
her
name
and
with
great
charm
told
the
princess
story
the
king
and
queen
overjoyed
to
know
that
was
a
great
princess
redoubled
their
caresses
but
the
prince
was
even
more
sensible
of
her
virtue
and
his
love
increased
as
the
fairy
unfolded
her
tale
his
impatience
to
marry
her
indeed
was
so
great
that
he
could
scarcely
allow
time
for
the
necessary
preparations
for
the
grand
wedding
which
was
their
due
the
king
and
queen
now
entirely
devoted
to
their
overwhelmed
her
with
affection
she
had
declared
that
she
could
not
marry
the
prince
without
the
consent
of
the
king
her
father
so
he
was
the
first
to
whom
an
invitation
to
the
wedding
was
sent
he
was
not
however
told
the
name
of
the
bride
the
who
as
was
right
presided
over
all
had
recommended
this
course
to
prevent
trouble
kings
came
from
all
the
countries
round
some
in
others
in
beautiful
carriages
those
who
came
from
the
most
distant
countries
rode
on
elephants
and
tigers
and
eagles
but
the
most
magnificent
and
most
glorious
of
all
was
the
father
of
the
princess
he
had
happily
recovered
his
reason
and
had
married
a
queen
who
was
a
widow
and
very
beautiful
but
by
whom
he
had
no
child
the
princess
ran
to
him
and
he
recognised
her
at
once
and
embraced
her
with
great
tenderness
before
she
had
time
to
throw
herself
on
her
knees
the
king
and
queen
presented
their
son
to
him
and
the
happiness
of
all
was
complete
the
nuptials
were
celebrated
with
all
imaginable
pomp
but
the
young
couple
were
hardly
aware
of
the
ceremony
so
wrapped
up
were
they
in
one
another
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
the
young
man
the
father
caused
his
son
to
be
crowned
the
same
day
and
kissing
his
hand
placed
him
on
the
throne
the
celebrations
of
this
illustrious
marriage
lasted
nearly
three
months
but
the
love
of
the
two
young
people
would
have
endured
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
had
they
that
age
so
great
was
their
affection
for
one
another
