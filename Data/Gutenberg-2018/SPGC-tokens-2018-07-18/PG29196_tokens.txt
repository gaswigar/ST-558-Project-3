every
weapon
there
was
a
defense
but
not
against
the
deadliest
weapon
man
himself
raging
trooper
lane
hovered
three
thousand
feet
above
tammany
square
the
cool
cybrain
surgically
implanted
in
him
was
working
on
the
problem
but
lane
had
no
more
patience
they
sweat
he
thought
hating
the
chill
that
threw
his
hovering
body
this
way
and
that
he
glared
down
at
the
three
towers
bordering
on
the
square
he
spat
and
watched
the
little
white
speck
fall
fall
me
up
in
barracks
all
i
wanted
was
a
little
time
off
did
i
fight
in
chi
for
them
damn
right
i
did
just
a
little
time
off
so
i
should
blow
my
top
now
the
he
was
going
over
all
their
heads
he
bowled
those
city
cops
over
like
paper
dolls
back
at
the
armory
the
black
dog
was
on
lane
back
old
mayor
himself
was
going
to
hear
about
it
not
ai
old
mayor
the
cinc
of
the
newyork
troopers
the
humming
embedded
beneath
his
shoulder
blades
held
him
motionless
above
newyork
three
administrative
towers
tammany
hall
mayor
palace
court
house
lane
cursed
his
stupidity
he
had
found
out
which
one
was
which
ahead
of
time
keep
troopers
in
the
armory
and
teach
them
how
to
fight
they
do
teach
them
about
their
own
city
that
they
be
fighting
for
there
no
time
from
seven
years
old
up
troopers
have
too
much
to
learn
about
the
mayor
was
behind
one
of
those
thousands
of
windows
old
cybrain
a
gift
from
the
trooper
surgeons
compliments
of
the
city
would
have
to
figure
out
which
one
blood
churned
in
his
veins
nerves
shrieked
with
impatience
lane
waited
for
the
electronic
brain
to
come
up
with
the
answer
then
his
head
jerked
up
to
a
distant
buzz
there
were
cops
coming
two
black
whirred
along
the
translucent
underside
of
newyork
the
shell
cybrain
better
be
fast
damn
fast
the
cybrain
jolted
an
impulse
through
his
spine
lane
somersaulted
cybrain
had
taken
charge
of
his
motor
nerves
lane
own
mind
was
just
along
for
the
ride
his
body
snapped
into
a
stiff
dive
position
he
began
to
plummet
down
picking
up
speed
his
mailed
hands
glittered
like
arrowheads
out
in
front
they
pointed
to
a
particular
window
in
one
of
the
towers
a
predatory
excitement
rippled
through
him
as
he
sailed
down
through
the
air
it
was
like
going
into
battle
again
a
little
flag
fluttered
on
a
staff
below
the
window
whose
flag
the
city
flag
was
orange
and
blue
he
shrugged
away
the
problem
cybrain
knew
what
it
was
doing
the
little
finger
of
his
right
hand
vibrated
in
its
metal
sheath
a
pale
vibray
leaped
from
the
lensed
fingertip
breakthrough
the
glasstic
pane
dissolved
lane
streamed
through
the
window
the
cut
off
lane
dropped
lightly
to
the
floor
inside
the
room
in
a
set
was
yammering
a
girl
screamed
hand
shot
out
automatically
a
finger
vibrated
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
lane
saw
the
girl
fold
to
the
floor
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
lane
still
in
a
crouch
chewed
his
lip
mayor
his
head
swung
around
and
he
peered
at
the
set
he
saw
his
own
face
lashing
police
with
his
vibray
said
the
announcer
lane
broke
through
the
cordon
surrounding
manhattan
armory
two
policemen
were
killed
four
others
seriously
injured
tammany
hall
has
warned
that
this
man
is
extremely
dangerous
citizens
are
cautioned
to
keep
clear
of
him
lane
is
an
insane
killer
he
is
armed
with
the
latest
military
weapons
a
electronic
brain
controls
his
reflexes
at
ease
with
that
jazz
said
lane
and
a
sheathed
finger
snapped
out
there
was
a
loud
bang
the
screen
dissolved
into
a
puddle
of
glasstic
lane
strode
to
the
window
the
two
police
boats
were
hovering
above
the
towers
lane
mailed
hand
snapped
open
a
pouch
at
his
belt
he
flipped
a
cube
to
the
floor
the
exploded
swelled
or
inflated
really
but
with
the
speed
of
a
blast
lane
glanced
out
the
window
a
section
of
the
energy
globe
bellied
out
from
above
it
shaded
the
view
from
his
window
and
the
tower
wall
just
below
now
the
girl
he
turned
back
to
the
room
wake
up
he
gave
the
blonde
girl
a
light
dose
of
the
vibray
to
slap
her
awake
who
are

said
shakily
lane
grinned

gerri
i

right
to
the
top
lane
broke
off
there
was
a
hum
outside
the
window
he
whirled
and
stared
out
the
rounded
black
hulls
of
the
two
police
were
nosing
toward
the
lane
could
read
the
white
numbers
painted
on
their
bows
a
loudspeaker
shouted
into
the
room
come

lane
turned
to
the
girl
i
thought
you
were
important
she
stood
there
with
her
hands
together
calmly
looking
at
him
i
am
but
you
are
too
to
them
mars
is
millions
of
miles
away
and
right
across
the
square
from
the
mayor
suite
yeah
but
lane
shook
his
head
and
turned
back
to
the
window
all
right
look
move
them
boats
away
and
i
let
this
girl
out
no
deal
lane
we
coming
in
the
police
boats
backed
away
slowly
then
shot
straight
up
out
of
the
line
of
vision
lane
looked
down
at
the
square
far
below
the
long
gleaming
barrel
of
a
blaster
cannon
caught
the
dim
light
filtering
down
through
shell
the
cannon
trundled
into
the
square
on
its
caterpillar
mounting
and
took
up
a
position
equidistant
from
the
bases
of
the
three
towers
now
a
rumble
of
many
voices
rose
from
below
lane
stared
down
to
see
a
large
crowd
gathering
in
tammany
square
sound
trucks
were
rolling
to
a
stop
around
the
edges
of
the
crowd
the
people
were
all
looking
up
lane
looked
across
the
square
the
windows
of
the
tower
opposite
the
ones
he
could
see
clearly
were
crowded
with
faces
there
were
white
dot
faces
on
the
balcony
that
gerri
kin
had
pointed
out
as
the
suite
the
voice
of
a
newscaster
rolled
up
from
the
square
reechoing
against
the
tower
walls
lane
is
holding
the
martian
ambassador
gerri
kin
hostage
you
can
see
the
martian
tricolor
behind
his
police
are
bringing
up
blaster
cannon
lane
defense
is
a
globe
of
energy
similar
to
the
one
which
protects
newyork
from
aerial
attack
lane
grinned
back
at
gerri
kin
whole
town
down
there
then
his
grin
faded
girl
like
this
probably
cared
a
lot
more
about
dying
than
he
did
why
the
hell
did
they
give
him
a
chance
to
let
her
out
maybe
he
could
do
it
now
cybrain
said
no
it
said
the
second
he
dropped
his
blast
this
room
to
hell
poor
girl
from
mars
she
did
have
a
chance
gerri
kin
put
her
hand
to
her
forehead
why
did
you
have
to
pick
my
room
why
did
they
send
me
to
this
crazy
city
private
soldiers
twenty
million
people
living
under
a
shell
like
worms
in
a
corpse
earth
is
sick
and
it
going
to
kill
me
what
going
to
happen
lane
looked
sadly
at
her
only
two
kinds
of
girls
ever
went
near
a
trooper
the
crazy
ones
and
the
ones
the
city
paid
why
did
he
have
to
be
so
near
getting
killed
when
he
met
one
he
liked
now
that
she
was
showing
a
little
less
fear
and
anger
she
was
talking
straight
to
him
she
was
good
but
she
was
acting
as
if
she
was
too
good
for
him
they
start
shooting
pretty
quick
said
lane
i
sorry
about
you
i
wish
i
could
write
a
letter
to
my
parents
she
said
what
did
you
understand
what
i
said
what
a
letter
you
do
know
where
mars
is
you
do
know
what
a
letter
is
you
probably
ca
even
read
and
write
lane
shrugged
he
carried
on
the
conversation
disinterestedly
professionally
relaxed
before
battle
what
these
things
i
ca
do
they
important
yes
the
more
i
see
of
this
city
and
its
people
the
more
important
i
realize
they
are
you
know
how
to
fight
do
you
i
bet
perfect
with
those
weapons
listen
they
been
training
me
to
fight
since
i
was
a
little
kid
why
should
i
be
a
great
little
fighter
specialization
said
the
girl
from
mars
what
specialization
everyone
i
met
in
this
city
is
a
specialist
sociospecs
run
the
government
technospecs
run
the
machinery
troopers
fight
the
wars
and
ninety
per
cent
of
the
people
do
work
at
all
because
they
not
trained
to
do
anything
the
fans
said
lane
they
got
it
soft
that
them
down
there
come
to
watch
the
fight
you
know
why
you
were
kept
in
the
armory
lane
i
heard
them
talking
about
it
at
the
dinner
i
went
to
last
night
why
because
they
afraid
of
the
troopers
you
men
did
too
good
a
job
out
in
chi
you
are
the
deadliest
weapon
that
has
ever
been
made
you
single
airborne
infantrymen
lane
said
they
told
us
in
trooper
academy
that
it
the
men
that
win
the
wars
yes
but
people
had
forgotten
it
until
the
sociospecs
of
newyork
came
up
with
the
troopers
before
the
troopers
governments
concentrated
on
the
big
weapons
the
missiles
the
bombs
and
the
cities
with
the
shells
were
safe
from
bombs
they
learned
to
be
under
the
shells
they
were
so
safe
so
isolated
that
national
governments
collapsed
but
you
troopers
wiped
out
that
feeling
of
security
when
you
infiltrated
chi
and
conquered
it
we
scared
them
huh
gerri
said
you
scared
them
so
much
that
they
were
afraid
to
let
you
have
a
furlough
in
the
city
when
you
came
back
afraid
you
troopers
would
realize
that
you
could
easily
take
over
the
city
if
you
wanted
to
you
scared
them
so
much
that
they
let
me
be
killed
they
actually
risk
trouble
with
mars
just
to
kill
you
i
sorry
about
you
i
mean
it
i
like
at
that
moment
a
titanic
explosion
hurled
him
to
the
carpet
deafened
and
blinded
him
he
recovered
and
saw
gerri
a
few
feet
away
dazed
groping
on
hands
and
knees
lane
jumped
to
the
window
looked
quickly
sprang
back
cybrain
pumped
orders
to
his
nervous
system
blaster
cannon
he
said
but
just
one
gotcha
cybrain
i
can
beat
that
he
picked
up
the
black
box
that
generated
his
protective
screen
snapping
it
open
with
he
turned
a
small
dial
then
he
waited
again
an
enormous
concussion
again
lane
and
gerri
were
thrown
to
the
floor
but
this
time
there
was
a
second
explosion
and
a
blinding
flash
from
below
lane
laughed
boyishly
and
ran
to
the
window
look
he
called
to
gerri
there
was
a
huge
gap
in
the
crowd
below
the
pavement
was
blackened
and
shattered
to
rubble
in
and
around
the
open
space
sprawled
dozens
of
tiny
black
figures
not
moving
backfire
said
lane
i
set
the
screen
to
throw
their
blaster
beam
right
back
at
them
and
they
knew
you
might
and
yet
they
let
a
crowd
congregate
gerri
reeled
away
from
the
window
sick
lane
said
i
can
do
that
a
couple
times
more
but
it
burns
out
the
then
i
dead
he
heard
the
newscaster
amplified
voice
approximately
fifty
killed
but
lane
is
through
now
he
has
been
able
to
outthink
police
with
the
help
of
his
cybrain
now
police
are
feeding
the
problem
to
their
giant
analogue
computer
in
the
of
the
court
house
the
police
analogue
computer
will
be
able
to
outthink
lane
cybrain
will
predict
lane
moves
in
advance
four
more
blaster
cannon
are
coming
down
broadway
why
do
they
clear
those
people
out
of
the
square
gerri
cried
what
oh
the
fans
nobody
clears
them
out
he
paused
i
got
one
more
chance
to
try
he
raised
a
mailed
glove
to
his
mouth
and
pressed
a
small
stud
in
the
wrist
he
said
trooper
hq
this
is

a
voice
spoke
in
his
helmet
lane
this
is
trooper

figured

colonel
klett
thirty
seconds
passed
lane
could
hear
the
clank
of
caterpillar
treads
as
the
mobile
blaster
cannon
rolled
into
tammany
square
the
voice
of
the
commanding
officer
of
the
troopers
rasped
into
ear

out
against
my
orders

the

says
if
i
drop
the
for
a
second
they
fire
into
the
room
and
then
we
both
be
dead
gerri
stood
with
folded
arms
and
looked
at
him
do
what
you
have
to
do
as
far
as
i
can
see
you
the
only
person
in
this
city
that
has
even
a
little
bit
of
right
on
his
side
lane
laughed
any
of
them
broads
i
know
would
be
crazy
scared
you
different
when
my
grandparents
landed
on
mars
they
found
out
that
selfishness
was
a
luxury
martians
ca
afford
it
lane
frowned
with
the
effort
of
thinking
you
said
i
had
a
little
right
on
my
side
that
a
good
feeling
nobody
ever
told
me
to
feel
that
way
about
myself
before
it
be
better
to
die
knowing
that
i
know
she
said
the
amplified
voice
from
below
said
the
police
analogue
computer
is
now
hooked
directly
to
the
controls
of
the
blaster
cannon
battery
it
will
outguess
lane
cybrain
and
check
his
moves
ahead
of
time
lane
looked
at
gerri
how
about
giving
me
a
kiss
before
they
get
us
be
nice
if
i
kissed
a
girl
like
you
just
once
in
my
life
she
smiled
and
walked
forward
you
deserve
it
lane
he
kissed
her
and
it
filled
him
with
longings
for
things
he
name
then
he
stepped
back
and
shook
his
head
it
ai
right
you
should
get
killed
if
i
take
a
dive
out
that
window
they
shoot
at
me
not
in
here
and
kill
you
all
the
sooner
better
than
getting
burned
up
in
this
lousy
little
room
you
also
got
right
on
your
side
there
too
many
damn
troopers
and
not
enough
good
persons
like
you
old
cybrain
says
stay
here
but
i
do
guess
i
will
i
gon
na
pay
you
back
for
that
kiss
but
you
safe
in
here
worry
about
yourself
not
about
me
lane
picked
up
the
and
handed
it
to
her
when
i
say
now
press
this
then
take
your
hand
off
real
fast
it
shut
off
the
screen
for
a
second
he
stepped
up
on
to
the
window
ledge
automatically
the
cybrain
cut
in
his
so
long
he
jumped
he
was
hurtling
across
the
square
when
the
blaster
cannons
opened
up
they
were
aimed
at
the
window
where
the
little
tricolor
was
flying
but
they
were
aimed
at
lane
either
they
were
shooting
wild
way
now
looks
like
i
got
a
chance
old
cybrain
says
fly
right
for
the
he
saw
the
mayor
balcony
ahead
to
hell
old
cybrain
i
doing
all
right
by
myself
i
come
to
see
the
mayor
and
i
gon
na
see
lane
plunged
forward
he
heard
the
shouts
of
frightened
men
he
swooped
over
the
balcony
railing
a
man
was
pointing
a
blaster
pistol
at
him
there
were
five
men
on
the
balcony
emergency
years
of
training
and
cybrain
took
over
lane
hand
shot
out
fingers
vibrating
as
he
dropped
to
the
balcony
floor
in
the
men
slumped
around
him
he
had
seen
the
man
with
the
blaster
pistol
before
it
was
the
mayor
of
newyork
lane
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
midst
of
the
sprawled
men
the
shrieks
of
the
crowd
floating
up
to
him
then
he
raised
his
glove
to
his
lips
he
made
contact
with
manhattan
armory
colonel
klett
sir
you
said
if
we
captured
the
city
government
we
might
have
a
chance
well
i
captured
the
city
government
what
do
we
do
with
it
now
lane
was
uncomfortable
in
his
dress
uniform
first
there
had
been
a
ceremony
in
tammany
square
inaugurating
newyork
new
military
protectorate
and
honoring
trooper
lane
now
there
was
a
formal
dinner
colonel
klett
and
gerri
kin
sat
on
either
side
of
lane
klett
said
call
me
an
opportunist
if
you
like
miss
kin
my
government
will
be
stable
and
mars
can
negotiate
with
it
he
was
a
lean
man
with
deep
grooves
in
his
face
and
gray
hair
gerri
shook
her
head
recognition
for
a
new
government
takes
time
going
back
to
mars
and
i
think
they
send
another
ambassador
next
time
nothing
personal
i
just
do
like
it
here
lane
said
i
going
to
mars
too
did
she
ask
you
to
demanded
klett
lane
shook
his
head
she
got
too
much
class
for
me
but
i
like
what
she
told
me
about
mars
it
healthy
like
klett
frowned
if
i
thought
there
was
a
gram
of
talent
involved
in
your
capture
of
the
mayor
lane
i
never
release
you
from
duty
but
i
know
better
you
beat
that
analogue
computer
by
sheer
stupidity
by
disregarding
your
cybrain
lane
said
it
was
so
stupid
if
it
worked
that
what
bothers
me
it
calls
for
a
revision
in
our
tactics
got
a
way
of
beating
those
big
computers
now
should
anyone
use
them
against
us
i
just
did
want
her
to
be
hurt
exactly
the
computer
could
outguess
a
machine
like
your
cybrain
but
you
introduced
a
totally
unpredictable
factor
human
emotion
which
proves
what
i
as
a
military
man
have
always
maintained
that
the
deadliest
weapon
in
man
arsenal
is
still
and
will
always
be
the
individual
soldier
what
you
just
said
there
sir
said
lane
that
why
i
leaving
newyork
what
do
you
mean
asked
colonel
klett
i
tired
of
being
a
weapon
sir
i
want
to
be
a
human
being
end
work
is
the
elimination
of
the
traces
