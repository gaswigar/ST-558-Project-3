playing
truant
a
breezy
morning
after
a
night
of
rain
fleecy
clouds
some
in
massive
folds
and
fantastic
shape
some
in
small
wisps
like
sunlit
ghosts
were
driven
rapidly
across
the
blue
hurrying
shadows
flecked
the
swelling
bosom
of
the
downs
and
where
the
grass
was
long
it
rippled
like
a
green
sea
making
rustling
music
overhead
the
larks
fluttering
upward
specks
to
the
empyrean
carolled
their
joyous
song
and
a
thousand
perfumes
filled
the
air
it
was
a
morning
to
live
in
to
enjoy
to
take
into
one
lungs
in
deep
intoxicating
draughts
until
the
sorrows
of
life
and
its
cares
were
forgotten
a
morning
that
lent
strong
wings
to
ambition
filling
the
future
with
hope
and
the
promise
of
realized
desires
something
of
the
aspect
of
the
morning
was
reflected
in
the
face
of
the
man
who
stoutly
climbed
the
downs
against
the
wind
he
was
above
the
average
height
but
did
not
give
the
impression
of
being
tall
his
frame
was
well
knit
and
muscular
strength
and
power
of
endurance
above
the
common
were
evident
in
every
movement
and
there
was
a
quiet
determination
in
his
face
which
proclaimed
him
one
of
those
who
would
be
likely
to
succeed
in
anything
he
undertook
no
matter
what
dangers
and
difficulties
might
stand
in
his
path
one
who
would
march
straight
forward
to
his
object
even
as
he
breasted
the
downs
this
morning
most
men
would
have
pronounced
him
handsome
judging
as
men
ever
do
by
build
and
muscle
women
might
have
hesitated
to
give
an
opinion
in
spite
of
the
face
and
the
dark
blue
eyes
which
never
looked
away
from
a
person
with
whom
their
possessor
talked
perhaps
there
was
a
want
of
sympathy
in
the
face
a
certain
lack
of
that
gentle
deference
which
so
appeals
to
women
in
a
man
that
silent
recognition
of
the
woman
power
which
is
so
pleasant
to
her
desmond
ellerey
had
had
little
to
do
with
women
he
did
not
pretend
to
understand
them
and
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
any
reason
why
he
should
strive
to
do
so
he
had
experienced
pleasant
moments
in
their
company
but
one
woman
was
pretty
much
the
same
as
another
to
him
and
it
is
quite
certain
that
no
such
thing
as
a
faded
flower
or
a
glove
or
love
token
of
any
kind
held
a
place
among
his
treasures
no
woman
in
the
past
had
given
him
a
single
heart
throb
which
love
lent
a
sense
of
pain
to
and
it
seemed
unlikely
that
any
woman
would
wish
to
do
so
now
for
desmond
ellerey
was
a
man
under
a
cloud
a
very
black
cloud
the
gloom
of
which
even
this
breezy
morning
could
not
entirely
dispel
from
his
face
he
had
set
himself
to
bear
his
burden
bravely
but
the
task
was
a
heavy
one
surely
those
straightforward
blue
eyes
gave
the
lie
to
much
that
was
said
against
him
there
were
few
hours
in
the
day
in
which
he
did
not
brood
over
his
trouble
over
the
loss
of
his
career
which
it
involved
and
as
he
approached
the
top
of
the
downs
his
eyes
were
bent
upon
the
ground
in
deep
thought
while
in
his
heart
was
fierce
rebellion
against
the
world
and
his
fellow
men
he
was
suddenly
startled
by
a
sharp
and
shrill
hallo
and
at
the
same
moment
was
aware
of
a
straw
hat
racing
past
him
a
little
to
his
left
a
run
of
a
few
yards
enabled
him
to
intercept
it
and
he
grasped
it
in
his
strong
fingers
regardless
of
the
flowers
and
ribbons
upon
it
then
he
turned
to
discover
the
owner
she
was
standing
on
the
summit
of
the
downs
her
loose
hair
streaming
in
the
breeze
she
did
not
come
to
meet
him
but
waited
for
him
to
go
to
her
i
am
afraid
it
is
not
improved
he
said
handing
her
the
hat
i
hardly
expected
it
would
be
when
i
saw
the
way
you
dived
for
it
she
answered
with
a
smile
but
thanks
all
the
same
had
it
got
past
you
it
would
have
been
to
it
altogether
is
this
a
morning
very
pleasant
after
the
rain
he
said
pleasant
she
cried
is
that
the
best
you
can
say
for
it
pleasant
why
it
makes
me
feel
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
which
is
beyond
my
power
no
difficulty
i
could
not
fight
and
overcome
no
danger
i
could
not
despise
and
laugh
at
my
blood
is
full
of
the
very
fire
i
of
life
and
i
pant
to
do
unexpected
outrageous
desperate
do
you
ever
feel
like
that
sometimes
it
is
good
to
be
a
man
she
went
on
he
has
the
world
before
him
with
its
high
places
waiting
to
be
won
there
is
nothing
out
of
his
reach
if
he
strive
sufficiently
no
honor
he
may
not
win
to
oh
i
wish
i
were
a
man
there
was
a
smile
upon
ellerey
face
at
her
enthusiasm
and
in
his
eyes
a
look
of
admiration
which
he
could
not
conceal
at
her
beauty
her
loose
hair
streaming
in
the
wind
was
the
color
of
burnished
copper
rich
as
a
golden
autumn
tint
in
the
glow
of
an
evening
sun
her
eyes
were
dark
yet
of
a
changeful
color
as
full
of
secrets
as
a
deep
pool
in
the
hollow
of
a
wood
quiet
silent
secrets
which
presently
when
the
time
came
a
lover
might
seek
to
understand
yet
promising
angry
and
tempestuous
moods
should
storms
happen
her
lips
parted
often
as
though
she
were
waiting
for
someone
with
eager
expectation
revealed
an
even
row
of
pearly
teeth
and
the
pink
flush
of
health
and
beauty
was
in
her
cheeks
she
was
tall
with
her
hair
done
up
would
have
passed
for
a
woman
already
desmond
thought
with
it
down
and
her
frock
to
her
she
was
still
a
girl
a
beautiful
girl
a
very
pleasant
picture
to
contemplate
being
a
man
is
not
always
such
a
grand
thing
as
you
suppose
ellerey
said
after
a
pause
he
has
a
freedom
which
a
woman
never
has
the
girl
answered
quickly
oh
yes
women
try
especially
in
this
country
i
know
but
it
is
never
the
same
she
can
not
be
a
statesman
she
can
not
be
a
soldier
she
can
not
take
her
life
by
the
throat
as
it
were
and
win
place
and
power
by
the
sheer
force
of
a
good
right
arm
as
a
man
can
but
she
often
succeeds
in
ruling
the
man
after
he
has
won
place
and
power
ellerey
answered
that
sort
of
conquest
does
not
appeal
to
me
ah
but
it
will
some
day
he
returned
quickly
and
then
he
half
regretted
his
words
remembering
she
was
but
a
girl
she
looked
at
him
curiously
for
a
moment
a
smile
upon
her
lips
yet
a
little
anger
lurking
in
her
eyes
you
think
i
am
very
young
she
said
are
you
not
and
very
innocent
or
ignorant
or
whatever
word
you
would
use
to
explain
me
you
can
hardly
have
probed
life
very
deeply
yet
said
ellerey
much
deeper
than
you
would
imagine
she
answered
you
are
not
so
very
wise
and
old
yourself
are
you
indeed
no
i
fancy
i
am
more
of
a
fool
than
anything
else
he
laughed
you
should
not
let
yourself
think
that
she
said
gravely
to
think
highly
of
one
powers
is
to
success
that
sounds
as
if
i
had
stolen
something
from
a
does
it
but
no
i
am
speaking
from
experience
why
do
you
laugh
some
of
us
have
to
touch
hardships
early
you
do
not
show
the
marks
of
such
experience
said
ellerey
hardly
knowing
whether
to
treat
her
seriously
or
not
no
but
i
might
were
i
conscious
of
what
is
before
me
i
am
not
as
other
girls
there
is
a
destiny
i
have
to
struggle
towards
an
end
i
must
win
it
was
born
into
handed
down
in
my
blood
through
generations
of
men
of
action
the
ambition
of
those
generations
of
men
beats
in
the
heart
of
a
woman
it
is
a
pity
but
i
shall
win
or
die
fighting
at
least
the
spirit
in
you
deserves
success
come
a
little
this
way
she
said
touching
his
arm
and
then
she
pointed
down
into
the
valley
below
them
do
you
see
that
building
yonder
white
among
the
trees
with
a
point
of
conical
roof
at
the
end
of
it
yes
do
you
know
what
it
is
no
by
this
time
they
are
hunting
for
me
all
over
that
place
down
there
i
heard
the
bell
ring
half
an
hour
ago
that
a
school
a
big
expensive
fashionable
school
where
they
teach
young
ladies
how
to
behave
properly
how
to
grow
up
to
rule
those
fighting
men
we
were
speaking
of
how
to
fit
themselves
to
be
their
wives
and
in
due
time
the
mothers
of
their
children
in
short
how
to
fulfil
their
destiny
woman
destiny
they
are
trying
to
teach
me
you
then
yes
i
one
of
the
girls
there
and
i
played
truant
and
yes
i
think
i
shall
go
back
presently
when
i
have
taken
my
fill
of
freedom
and
this
glorious
morning
and
will
get
punished
i
am
afraid
said
ellerey
perhaps
but
it
will
not
be
very
heavy
punishment
it
is
strange
but
they
rather
like
me
there
in
spite
of
everything
i
do
not
think
that
is
strange
at
all
no
you
would
you
a
man
she
answered
quickly
and
men
are
weak
where
attractive
women
are
concerned
all
the
world
over
such
a
declaration
coming
from
a
truant
schoolgirl
somewhat
startled
ellerey
and
yet
as
he
looked
at
her
he
was
more
conscious
of
the
woman
than
the
girl
oh
yes
i
know
i
am
attractive
she
went
on
and
there
was
no
deepening
of
the
color
in
her
face
as
she
said
it
i
am
glad
that
it
is
so
my
looks
will
help
me
when
the
work
of
my
life
begins
in
earnest
when
i
have
played
the
truant
from
school
for
the
last
time
and
do
not
go
back
then
you
intend
to
run
away
eventually
yes
unless
another
way
should
seem
better
that
shocks
you
i
often
shock
them
down
at
the
white
house
yonder
and
they
excuse
me
because
i
am
a
foreigner
you
english
are
so
polite
you
do
not
seem
to
expect
foreigners
to
know
how
to
behave
and
you
make
excuses
for
them
it
is
very
funny
it
makes
me
laugh
and
she
laughed
so
merrily
that
her
former
gravity
seemed
more
unnatural
you
speak
english
perfectly
i
should
not
have
taken
you
for
a
foreigner
said
ellerey
and
french
and
german
and
my
own
tongue
i
speak
them
all
perfectly
i
have
lived
in
all
these
countries
it
was
necessary
and
you
do
not
like
england
nor
englishmen
i
have
not
said
so
she
answered
but
here
in
england
i
am
being
taken
care
of
kept
out
of
mischief
and
sometimes
i
feel
like
a
prisoner
it
is
only
that
which
makes
me
dislike
england
of
englishmen
i
know
little
but
i
have
read
about
them
and
they
have
done
some
good
brave
deeds
they
are
perhaps
just
a
little
conceited
with
themselves
do
you
think
there
is
no
one
quite
like
an
englishman
it
would
seem
there
are
all
sorts
good
and
bad
said
ellerey
carelessly
at
the
best
he
wants
a
lot
of
beating
at
the
worst
well
he
wants
a
lot
of
beating
that
way
too
how
is
it
you
feel
like
a
prisoner
the
girl
drew
herself
up
to
her
full
height
there
was
something
haughty
in
her
demeanor
occasioned
perhaps
by
the
careless
way
in
which
he
asked
the
question
she
felt
that
he
was
treating
her
rather
like
a
spoilt
child
while
she
felt
herself
a
determined
woman
in
my
own
country
i
am
a
princess
she
said
indeed
you
do
not
believe
me
why
not
you
look
every
inch
a
princess
he
answered
it
is
so
like
a
man
to
say
what
he
thinks
will
please
she
returned
with
a
flash
in
her
eyes
you
do
not
believe
me
but
you
are
afraid
to
say
so
go
down
there
and
ask
them
i
do
not
disbelieve
you
said
ellerey
quietly
the
girl
relented
in
a
moment
we
should
be
very
good
friends
you
and
i
if
we
knew
each
other
you
have
ambition
i
can
see
it
in
your
face
i
had
princess
hush
no
one
calls
me
that
here
why
do
you
say
you
had
ambition
you
would
not
understand
try
me
and
see
she
said
standing
close
beside
him
as
though
to
measure
her
strength
against
his
for
a
moment
you
may
trust
me
i
would
trust
you
anywhere
in
peace
or
war
ellerey
looked
at
her
curiously
for
an
instant
with
a
sudden
desire
to
take
her
into
his
confidence
then
he
shook
his
head
slowly
it
was
pleasant
to
hear
such
faith
expressed
in
him
and
he
was
unwilling
to
destroy
the
faith
of
this
fair
woman
altogether
a
woman
she
seemed
to
him
just
then
you
will
not
never
mind
perhaps
one
day
you
will
only
never
speak
of
ambition
as
something
past
that
is
weak
and
unmanly
upon
my
honor
you
do
me
good
ellerey
exclaimed
and
you
me
she
answered
eagerly
to
look
at
you
makes
me
feel
strong
it
is
good
when
a
man
makes
a
woman
feel
like
that
i
am
a
woman
although
i
am
still
at
school
there
is
southern
blood
in
me
and
we
become
women
earlier
than
english
girls
do
listen
there
are
england
and
france
and
germany
and
austria
and
russia
all
interested
in
me
and
nothing
would
please
them
all
so
much
as
my
death
as
it
is
i
am
a
difficulty
in
all
their
politics
they
would
like
me
to
forget
who
and
what
i
am
they
would
marry
me
to
some
nobleman
of
no
importance
if
they
could
just
to
keep
me
quiet
and
you
will
not
be
quiet
no
why
should
i
be
would
you
in
my
country
a
usurper
is
upon
the
throne
kept
there
held
there
like
a
child
who
would
fall
but
for
its
nurse
arms
by
all
the
powers
of
europe
it
is
i
who
should
be
there
it
is
i
who
will
be
there
one
day
shall
i
tell
you
there
are
hundreds
thousands
of
men
who
are
ready
to
strike
in
my
cause
when
the
time
is
ripe
even
now
there
is
a
statesman
working
to
set
these
countries
at
cross
purposes
with
one
another
and
when
they
quarrel
then
is
my
opportunity
you
shall
see
that
is
why
i
said
i
would
be
a
man
if
i
could
it
would
be
so
much
easier
for
a
man
but
as
it
is
a
woman
shall
do
it
i
hope
you
may
you
deserve
to
but
you
doubt
it
she
said
there
seem
to
be
heavy
odds
against
you
that
helps
me
it
stirs
up
the
best
that
is
in
me
it
is
good
to
have
something
to
struggle
for
something
to
win
and
if
i
may
not
win
i
hope
to
fall
in
the
press
of
the
fight
and
to
the
loud
funeral
music
of
clashing
steel
find
the
death
of
a
soldier
what
is
your
name
desmond
ellerey
it
is
an
easy
name
to
remember
well
desmond
ellerey
if
your
ambition
finds
no
outlet
in
england
come
to
my
country
to
the
city
of
sturatzberg
and
claim
friendship
with
princess
maritza
she
shall
find
you
work
for
your
good
right
arm
she
walked
away
from
him
as
though
she
had
bestowed
a
great
favor
never
looking
back
she
went
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
school
her
truant
spirit
not
yet
satisfied
and
ellerey
watched
her
until
he
lost
sight
of
the
tall
graceful
figure
in
a
fold
of
the
downs
then
he
turned
and
went
slowly
back
the
way
he
had
come
desmond
ellerey
had
declared
that
she
had
done
him
good
it
was
true
although
he
walked
slowly
his
spirit
was
stirred
within
him
and
his
blood
ran
with
something
of
its
old
vigor
faced
by
a
thousand
difficulties
this
girl
had
the
courage
to
look
upon
them
bravely
and
to
believe
in
her
power
to
overcome
them
that
was
her
secret
the
belief
in
her
own
power
he
had
faced
his
difficulties
bravely
enough
but
he
had
not
had
the
courage
to
hope
therein
lay
his
weakness
and
this
girl
this
princess
had
shown
it
to
him
he
had
allowed
himself
to
drift
into
a
backwater
it
was
time
he
pulled
out
into
the
stream
again
and
fought
his
way
back
to
his
rightful
place
inch
by
inch
against
whatever
tide
might
run
for
some
little
time
he
had
been
staying
with
sir
charles
and
lady
martin
two
people
who
had
looked
into
his
eyes
when
he
had
denied
the
charges
brought
against
him
and
had
believed
him
as
he
crossed
the
lawn
toward
the
house
he
met
his
host
i
have
had
an
adventure
charles
i
have
met
a
princess
there
are
some
pretty
rustic
maidens
in
the
village
i
have
been
struck
with
their
beauty
myself
i
mean
a
real
princess
at
least
she
said
so
desmond
answered
she
was
playing
truant
from
school
a
large
white
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
downs
do
you
mean
a
tall
girl
asked
sir
charles
have
you
seen
her
desmond
asked
no
but
i
know
all
about
her
ah
i
thought
you
could
have
seen
her
or
you
would
describe
her
as
a
tall
girl
she
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
ever
saw
she
spoke
the
truth
then
she
is
a
princess
oh
yes
but
the
sooner
she
forgets
the
fact
the
better
for
her
and
for
for
everybody
she
is
the
descendant
of
a
line
of
rulers
chiefly
remarkable
for
their
inability
to
rule
and
her
chance
of
ascending
the
throne
of
her
fathers
is
absolutely
fortunately
for
europe
you
are
not
a
student
of
contemporary
history
desmond
or
you
would
know
something
about
wallaria
and
its
exiled
princess
i
am
not
a
diplomat
but
a
soldier
at
least
i
was
desmond
answered
still
i
should
like
to
improve
my
knowledge
that
is
easily
managed
said
sir
charles
if
you
come
into
the
library
i
can
find
you
a
heap
of
literature
concerning
this
little
wasps
nest
of
a
state
and
when
you
have
mastered
the
position
thank
your
natal
stars
that
you
were
not
born
to
take
a
hand
in
ruling
it
it
is
a
menace
to
europe
desmond
that
the
truth
of
the
matter
wallaria
may
at
any
time
be
the
cause
of
a
european
war
if
this
princess
of
yours
had
her
way
that
time
would
not
be
long
in
coming
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
desmond
ellerey
filled
a
corner
of
the
library
with
tobacco
smoke
and
his
head
with
a
thousand
details
concerning
wallaria
when
he
went
to
dress
for
dinner
he
felt
that
he
had
been
reading
an
absorbing
romance
and
blessed
the
good
fortune
which
had
brought
about
the
meeting
on
the
downs
helen
and
i
have
been
talking
about
you
desmond
said
sir
charles
after
dinner
not
revising
your
opinion
of
me
i
hope
no
said
lady
martin
but
thinking
of
your
future
why
not
travel
for
a
little
while
desmond
for
a
year
or
so
it
will
give
time
for
the
truth
to
leak
out
it
will
leak
out
you
know
even
as
a
lie
does
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
go
abroad
said
desmond
quietly
i
shall
clear
out
of
england
before
the
month
is
over
it
has
been
awfully
good
of
you
both
to
have
me
here
at
a
time
when
most
of
my
friends
found
it
convenient
to
forget
me
i
shall
not
come
back
until
the
men
who
were
so
ready
to
accuse
me
have
eaten
their
words
and
the
country
so
ready
to
dispense
with
my
services
asks
for
them
again
that
will
come
in
time
said
lady
martin
i
am
glad
to
hear
your
determination
said
sir
charles
where
are
you
going
to
wallaria
wallaria
why
not
it
seems
there
is
room
for
a
soldier
there
sir
charles
looked
grave
but
desmond
supposing
i
know
what
you
would
say
returned
ellerey
quickly
supposing
englishmen
should
have
to
fight
against
wallaria
and
i
should
have
to
carry
arms
against
my
country
well
with
whom
does
the
fault
lie
with
england
or
with
me
england
has
dispensed
with
my
services
believing
a
lie
she
drives
me
from
her
and
makes
me
a
renegade
what
allegiance
do
i
owe
to
england
i
will
offer
my
sword
to
wallaria
and
if
she
will
have
it
by
heaven
she
shall
lady
martin
put
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
pressed
it
in
kindly
sympathy
for
a
moment
and
then
left
the
room
sleep
on
it
desmond
you
will
think
better
of
it
in
the
morning
said
sir
charles
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
both
of
you
said
ellerey
turning
round
suddenly
when
lady
martin
had
gone
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
it
seems
poor
gratitude
to
pain
you
now
such
a
contingency
as
we
imagine
will
probably
never
arise
but
i
have
decided
to
go
the
princess
has
bewitched
you
nonsense
am
i
not
offering
my
sword
to
the
usurper
her
enemy
my
ambitions
have
been
nipped
like
a
tree
in
the
budding
here
and
i
see
a
new
outlet
for
my
energies
yonder
that
is
all
my
own
country
despises
me
i
hope
for
better
things
from
the
country
of
my
adoption
chapter
ii
monsieur
de
froilette
at
a
turn
of
the
road
which
had
been
deserted
for
some
two
hours
past
a
man
suddenly
reined
in
his
horse
to
a
walking
pace
he
had
ridden
far
for
his
dress
was
dusty
and
the
animal
showed
signs
of
fatigue
the
evening
was
and
there
was
a
bite
in
the
wind
blowing
from
the
higher
lands
to
the
plain
the
road
ran
with
many
a
twist
and
turn
between
dense
woods
on
one
side
and
rugged
waste
ground
with
tangled
patches
of
undergrowth
on
the
other
here
and
there
a
clearing
had
been
made
in
the
woods
and
a
rough
dwelling
erected
but
they
were
apparently
deserted
there
were
no
signs
of
life
about
them
this
evening
the
man
rode
easily
yet
with
constant
watchfulness
the
times
were
unsettled
and
dangerous
and
the
slightest
unfamiliar
sound
instantly
attracted
his
attention
he
was
accustomed
to
be
on
the
alert
and
whatever
thoughts
held
sway
behind
his
gloomy
looks
they
were
not
sufficiently
absorbing
to
render
him
careless
for
a
moment
suddenly
he
pulled
his
horse
to
a
standstill
turning
sharply
in
his
saddle
to
look
back
upon
the
way
he
had
come
then
he
examined
his
holster
and
moving
his
horse
to
a
position
which
gave
him
a
better
command
of
the
road
sat
quietly
waiting
the
sound
which
had
attracted
his
attention
grew
rapidly
nearer
and
presently
three
riders
came
round
the
bend
at
a
gallop
one
some
paces
in
advance
of
his
companions
he
pulled
up
short
seeing
the
motionless
horseman
by
the
roadside
scenting
danger
and
ready
for
it
but
the
next
moment
he
raised
his
hat
with
pronounced
courtesy
and
bowed
low
in
his
saddle
pardon
monsieur
he
said
but
one
sees
a
possible
enemy
in
so
unexpected
an
encounter
unexpected
monsieur
i
said
so
may
i
add
fortunate
too
such
enemies
as
you
suggest
seldom
stand
singly
was
the
rather
ungracious
answer
and
in
these
times
wise
men
seldom
ride
alone
monsieur
came
the
quick
retort
i
travel
with
an
escort
myself
you
see
captain
ellerey
i
do
not
make
a
mistake
i
think
you
are
captain
ellerey
of
his
majesty
regiment
of
chasseurs
that
is
my
name
and
you
are
returning
to
sturatzberg
good
we
can
proceed
together
and
without
waiting
for
an
assent
to
this
arrangement
he
ordered
his
servants
to
go
forward
and
watched
them
until
they
had
disappeared
now
monsieur
we
may
go
forward
at
our
leisure
i
have
not
the
honor
of
my
name
ah
it
is
of
small
consequence
jules
de
froilette
at
your
service
it
is
unknown
to
you
i
think
so
but
your
face
seems
familiar
said
ellerey
as
they
went
on
together
ah
yes
i
go
to
court
sometimes
and
i
but
seldom
monsieur
then
you
may
have
seen
me
in
the
streets
of
sturatzberg
i
know
the
city
well
and
have
nothing
to
hide
i
have
interests
in
this
country
let
us
say
in
timber
it
is
the
answer
i
give
when
i
am
questioned
for
no
one
respects
a
lazy
man
a
voluntary
exile
from
my
country
i
have
no
quarrel
with
france
nor
she
with
me
in
these
days
men
are
become
cosmopolitan
is
it
not
so
it
looks
like
it
in
sturatzberg
ellerey
replied
monsieur
is
also
an
exile
and
has
no
quarrel
with
his
motherland
at
least
i
do
not
speak
of
it
monsieur
de
froilette
pardon
me
i
am
not
inquisitive
you
crave
for
excitement
so
come
to
sturatzberg
the
promise
of
adventure
will
ever
attract
men
of
spirit
and
and
the
failures
at
home
suggested
ellerey
i
was
going
to
say
men
of
courage
de
froilette
answered
but
the
failures
come
too
and
succeed
sometimes
you
are
as
doubtful
of
the
reward
as
i
am
said
ellerey
laughing
de
froilette
did
not
join
in
his
merriment
a
captain
of
horse
is
not
to
be
despised
he
said
slowly
glancing
furtively
at
his
companion
true
but
he
remains
a
captain
of
horse
i
expected
rapid
events
in
this
country
and
quick
promotion
for
those
who
came
out
of
the
struggle
with
their
lives
instead
we
have
an
expedition
against
some
fastness
which
is
deserted
when
we
arrive
or
a
troop
to
quell
a
petty
riot
which
has
fizzled
out
when
we
get
there
and
that
is
all
and
monsieur
thirsts
for
more
the
desperate
encounter
and
the
bloody
sword
for
high
place
and
court
favor
is
it
too
great
an
ambition
ellerey
demanded
do
we
not
all
from
the
bottom
rung
of
the
ladder
look
eagerly
toward
the
top
the
student
to
the
masters
of
his
profession
the
apprentice
to
the
seat
of
his
employer
why
should
not
a
soldier
look
for
high
favor
at
court
such
favor
must
be
won
captain
ellerey
i
am
willing
to
win
it
patience
you
shall
not
always
find
those
fastnesses
deserted
those
riots
quelled
when
you
arrive
this
is
the
waiting
time
the
preparing
time
and
there
are
difficulties
in
the
way
of
promotion
let
me
ask
you
are
you
loved
in
your
regiment
neither
loved
nor
hated
and
in
the
city
i
have
few
friends
a
captain
of
horse
does
not
command
them
that
is
not
the
reason
it
is
because
you
are
a
foreigner
de
froilette
answered
you
are
welcome
to
fight
this
country
battles
welcome
to
get
killed
in
them
but
you
must
not
participate
in
any
rewards
if
sturatzberg
could
do
without
us
how
many
foreigners
would
wake
tomorrow
in
the
city
think
you
all
europe
has
talked
of
such
a
rebellion
but
it
does
not
come
said
ellerey
it
will
was
the
answer
and
if
you
are
strong
enough
you
may
take
the
reward
you
speak
in
riddles
is
it
wise
to
speak
plainly
and
de
froilette
swept
out
his
arm
as
though
the
prospect
before
them
gave
the
answer
they
had
left
the
woods
and
the
rough
country
behind
them
and
were
approaching
houses
for
sturatzberg
had
grown
and
spread
itself
beyond
its
walls
in
the
distance
the
lights
of
the
city
blinked
under
the
dome
of
growing
darkness
while
to
the
right
a
long
line
of
light
marked
the
citadel
and
the
palace
of
the
king
there
are
eyes
ears
about
us
looking
and
listening
for
treachery
de
froilette
went
on
every
man
suspects
his
neighbor
and
has
fingers
ready
for
the
knife
handle
yonder
in
the
citadel
amid
the
laughter
and
the
music
a
dozen
plots
will
creep
forward
a
space
before
the
dawn
does
monsieur
the
captain
long
to
play
a
part
in
the
intrigues
there
yes
so
that
it
is
honest
monsieur
must
decide
we
part
here
it
is
better
so
come
to
me
at
the
altstrasse
at
ten
we
can
talk
further
until
then
and
de
froilette
put
his
horse
into
a
canter
leaving
ellerey
to
pursue
his
way
alone
entering
the
city
by
the
eastern
gate
ellerey
crossed
the
konigplatz
at
walking
pace
on
his
way
to
his
lodging
by
the
western
gate
they
were
a
people
in
sturatzberg
working
as
little
as
possible
and
spending
without
a
thought
of
the
morrow
the
cafes
were
full
the
laughter
sounded
genuine
enough
and
there
was
little
indication
of
the
coming
storm
of
revolution
so
confidently
predicted
by
de
froilette
ellerey
mind
was
busy
with
the
events
of
the
afternoon
for
two
years
he
had
been
in
sturatzberg
ready
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
distinguishing
himself
whenever
it
arose
it
had
not
come
yet
his
life
had
been
passed
on
a
dead
level
of
inactivity
and
the
stirring
times
he
had
hoped
for
seemed
as
far
away
as
ever
many
a
time
had
his
thoughts
gone
back
to
that
breezy
morning
on
the
downs
and
he
devoutly
wished
that
princess
maritza
would
come
to
sturatzberg
so
that
he
might
go
to
her
claim
friendship
with
her
and
ask
for
that
work
for
his
good
right
arm
which
she
had
promised
to
give
who
was
this
de
froilette
and
why
should
he
take
an
interest
in
him
or
wish
to
help
him
for
such
favors
there
was
always
a
price
to
be
paid
in
some
form
or
other
would
it
be
wise
to
go
to
the
altstrasse
and
another
question
came
to
him
a
question
that
set
his
pulse
beating
faster
for
a
moment
was
this
de
froilette
an
emissary
of
the
princess
maritza
might
she
not
be
in
sturatzberg
now
might
he
not
see
her
i
would
risk
anything
for
that
he
said
as
he
swung
himself
from
the
saddle
and
whatever
the
adventure
is
so
that
it
has
a
spice
of
danger
in
it
it
is
welcome
i
shall
know
how
to
take
care
of
myself
if
the
price
asked
be
too
heavy
a
big
bearded
man
came
forward
to
take
the
horse
and
the
manner
in
which
he
drew
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
mouth
suggested
that
he
had
left
the
tankard
hastily
has
anyone
inquired
for
me
stefan
no
captain
i
have
been
undisturbed
until
now
the
man
answered
in
a
deep
voice
well
suited
to
his
frame
as
he
led
the
horse
away
knowing
his
weakness
and
his
capacity
for
indulging
in
it
with
impunity
ellerey
wondered
how
long
a
time
he
would
require
undisturbed
before
signs
of
his
potations
showed
themselves
drink
heavily
he
certainly
did
but
since
he
never
exhibited
any
ill
effects
from
it
at
night
or
morning
it
would
have
been
unjust
to
call
him
a
drunkard
the
altstrasse
was
of
the
old
town
a
narrow
thoroughfare
of
gaunt
houses
which
now
sheltered
a
dozen
families
in
rooms
where
the
wealthy
had
once
lived
and
in
which
ministers
and
ambassadors
had
entertained
the
wit
beauty
and
bravery
of
nations
these
glories
had
departed
to
the
palatial
buildings
which
had
grown
up
round
the
citadel
leaving
the
altstrasse
as
misfortune
may
leave
a
gentleman
the
marks
of
breeding
evident
though
he
be
clad
in
rusty
garments
over
the
doorways
through
which
tatterdemalions
men
women
and
children
flocked
in
and
out
were
handsome
carvings
crests
and
ragged
garments
were
hung
to
dry
over
handsome
balustrades
and
railings
while
in
the
rough
and
broken
roadway
garbage
cast
there
days
since
lay
rotting
where
it
had
fallen
poverty
had
seized
upon
the
place
flaunting
poverty
seeking
no
concealment
ellerey
had
passed
through
the
altstrasse
before
but
the
surroundings
had
had
no
particular
interest
for
him
then
now
they
arrested
his
attention
what
plots
might
not
have
birth
and
grow
to
dangerous
maturity
in
such
surroundings
among
such
people
as
these
the
rabble
had
overrun
these
deserted
mansions
might
it
not
one
day
hammer
at
the
doors
of
the
palaces
by
the
citadel
yonder
with
demands
not
to
be
gainsaid
what
manner
of
man
was
this
de
froilette
what
ends
had
he
in
view
that
he
should
live
in
such
a
place
number
looked
as
faded
as
its
neighbors
showed
even
fewer
lights
in
its
windows
and
except
that
no
small
crowd
hung
about
the
closed
door
was
no
whit
more
attractive
than
ever
ellerey
summons
was
answered
immediately
however
and
he
entered
a
large
bare
stone
hall
the
dim
light
which
hung
in
the
centre
disclosing
many
doors
on
either
side
monsieur
is
expected
said
the
man
deferentially
leading
the
way
down
a
stone
passage
and
up
a
flight
of
stairs
to
a
landing
corresponding
with
the
hall
below
but
how
different
here
was
luxury
a
deep
carpet
deadened
the
footfall
rich
curtains
hung
over
windows
and
doorways
and
ancient
arms
were
upon
the
walls
ellerey
had
little
time
to
appreciate
more
than
the
general
effect
for
the
man
drawing
back
a
heavy
curtain
opened
a
door
and
without
making
any
announcement
stood
aside
for
him
to
enter
welcome
mon
ami
welcome
said
de
froilette
coming
forward
to
meet
him
confidences
are
easier
here
than
on
the
highway
the
room
was
perfect
the
abode
of
a
man
of
taste
with
the
means
to
gratify
it
to
the
full
it
was
costly
and
unique
a
collector
room
discriminately
arranged
and
the
owner
motioning
his
guest
to
a
chair
was
worthy
of
his
surroundings
in
the
afternoon
he
had
been
muffled
in
a
cloak
and
ellerey
had
noticed
little
of
his
appearance
beyond
the
fact
that
his
eyes
were
dark
and
restless
now
he
saw
a
man
courtly
and
distinguished
in
a
manner
with
a
clever
earnest
face
at
once
attractive
and
inviting
confidence
his
hair
cut
short
and
his
beard
trimmed
to
a
fine
point
were
black
with
a
few
streaks
of
white
in
them
but
his
face
was
young
looking
the
lines
few
and
faint
his
fifty
years
sat
lightly
upon
him
one
would
have
judged
him
a
student
or
a
traveller
rather
than
a
politician
or
a
man
fighting
life
strenuously
my
surroundings
surprise
you
he
said
with
a
smile
such
things
are
hardly
looked
for
in
the
altstrasse
ellerey
answered
they
are
a
part
of
myself
captain
ellerey
but
i
wish
to
remain
in
privacy
your
elect
of
the
city
do
not
naturally
visit
in
the
altstrasse
and
i
have
rooms
below
bare
enough
to
impress
uninteresting
people
with
the
fact
that
i
am
a
poor
sort
of
fellow
and
likely
to
be
an
unprofitable
acquaintance
for
my
friends
well
you
see
i
have
other
apartments
i
thank
you
for
the
preference
shown
me
said
ellerey
with
a
bow
and
since
we
parted
have
been
speculating
on
the
reason
is
it
not
so
naturally
i
think
i
can
help
you
i
believe
you
can
assist
me
there
is
the
position
in
a
nutshell
i
am
honest
i
make
no
pretence
of
liking
unprofitable
friends
myself
but
we
will
talk
afterward
monsieur
he
added
as
a
servant
announced
supper
and
de
froilette
led
the
way
into
an
adjoining
room
the
meal
was
faultlessly
served
at
a
round
table
lighted
by
candles
in
quaint
silver
candlesticks
although
not
exactly
an
epicure
de
froilette
understood
a
supper
of
this
description
as
perhaps
only
a
frenchman
can
and
his
taste
in
wines
was
excellent
he
led
the
conversation
into
general
topics
talked
of
paris
and
london
with
equal
ease
and
knowledge
and
of
berlin
vienna
and
petersburg
only
a
little
less
intimately
i
have
said
i
am
cosmopolitan
he
explained
after
all
it
is
the
greatest
nationality
to
which
a
man
can
belong
coffee
in
the
library
francois
de
froilette
ushered
his
guest
into
another
room
which
from
floor
to
ceiling
was
lined
with
books
books
on
all
subjects
and
in
many
languages
a
huge
littered
with
letters
and
foreign
newspapers
occupied
the
centre
of
the
apartment
which
was
evidently
a
working
room
though
luxurious
in
all
its
appointments
de
froilette
did
not
speak
until
the
servant
had
placed
the
coffee
on
a
side
table
and
had
left
the
room
when
he
turned
suddenly
toward
ellerey
i
followed
you
monsieur
it
was
not
a
chance
meeting
i
am
not
surprised
said
ellery
twice
before
you
overtook
me
i
heard
the
sound
of
galloping
horses
and
was
prepared
for
an
enemy
and
instead
behold
a
friend
de
froilette
laughed
pushing
a
silver
box
of
cigarettes
across
the
table
you
must
bear
with
me
if
i
am
prosy
for
a
time
i
can
promise
you
that
the
end
of
the
story
is
better
than
the
beginning
ellerey
settled
himself
to
listen
attentively
the
history
of
this
country
monsieur
is
composed
as
it
were
of
the
rough
ends
and
edges
of
the
histories
of
other
countries
every
crisis
in
europe
causes
trouble
of
some
kind
here
and
first
one
family
and
then
another
have
become
paramount
in
sturatzberg
all
the
powers
have
recognized
one
fact
however
that
wallaria
must
be
kept
inviolate
so
it
is
that
this
is
an
independent
kingdom
the
position
is
unique
and
gives
the
king
within
his
own
realm
a
power
more
autocratic
than
the
czar
should
he
care
to
use
it
since
he
has
only
to
play
off
one
great
power
against
another
to
preserve
himself
from
attack
you
follow
me
ellerey
murmured
an
assent
wondering
what
this
recital
was
to
lead
to
it
is
clear
that
his
majesty
does
not
use
this
power
de
froilette
went
on
he
may
be
timid
he
may
lack
ambition
we
will
speak
no
treachery
but
in
times
past
there
have
been
ambitious
monarchs
and
still
little
has
happened
why
because
monsieur
recognizing
that
this
country
is
one
of
the
chief
factors
in
preserving
the
peace
of
europe
the
nations
have
sent
the
ablest
men
they
possess
as
their
ambassadors
to
sturatzberg
your
british
minister
is
a
case
in
point
the
result
is
that
to
the
present
time
no
monarch
has
risen
with
courage
enough
allied
to
sufficient
political
acumen
to
take
his
own
course
carry
it
to
success
have
you
ever
realized
monsieur
that
sturatzberg
might
play
with
the
nations
of
europe
as
a
gambler
plays
his
hand
of
cards
i
am
no
diplomatist
ellerey
answered
de
froilette
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
though
the
point
were
immaterial
to
him
and
went
on
to
all
appearance
the
facts
are
as
they
have
always
been
with
one
great
and
important
exception
the
people
the
people
are
awaking
to
the
sensation
that
they
are
ruled
and
oppressed
for
so
they
consider
it
by
foreigners
they
have
had
secretly
preached
to
them
and
they
understand
what
possibilities
there
are
and
a
wave
of
national
enthusiasm
is
silently
stealing
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
the
bolder
spirits
have
already
declared
against
law
and
order
as
it
exists
by
flying
to
the
hills
and
associating
themselves
with
the
brigands
there
the
forces
under
the
outlaw
vasilici
i
am
told
increase
daily
you
have
heard
of
him
captain
ellerey
and
have
tried
to
find
him
ellerey
answered
with
a
smile
but
his
fastness
in
the
mountains
was
always
deserted
when
we
got
there
some
day
it
will
not
be
a
leader
worthy
of
the
cause
will
be
found
the
people
will
remember
that
there
are
others
with
an
equal
or
better
right
to
the
throne
than
his
majesty
and
then
you
will
have
the
revolution
i
presume
monsieur
the
leader
is
found
and
only
awaits
the
opportunity
said
ellerey
you
are
right
captain
she
is
found
de
froilette
answered
slowly
a
woman
ellerey
exclaimed
and
he
felt
the
color
flush
to
his
face
as
he
spoke
he
forgot
for
a
moment
that
his
sword
was
pledged
to
the
king
his
thoughts
went
back
to
that
breezy
morning
on
the
downs
and
the
tall
straight
girl
with
her
bright
hair
streaming
in
the
wind
de
froilette
laughed
a
woman
captain
ellerey
who
destines
you
for
high
service
let
her
plead
for
herself
and
as
he
spoke
he
opened
the
door
and
stood
aside
with
bowed
head
a
woman
entered
tall
she
was
and
of
imperial
mien
diamonds
glistened
in
the
coils
of
her
raven
hair
her
face
was
beautiful
her
smiling
lips
and
deep
soft
eyes
full
of
sympathy
and
tenderness
seemed
incapable
of
any
stern
expression
of
anger
a
woman
born
to
rule
born
to
lead
but
not
the
woman
ellerey
had
expected
to
see
it
was
the
queen
and
ellerey
bowed
low
before
her
you
have
not
been
unnoticed
by
us
captain
ellerey
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
we
would
have
you
more
constantly
at
court
i
shall
obey
your
majesty
ellerey
answered
there
are
stirring
times
at
hand
she
went
on
times
in
which
men
may
strive
and
win
his
majesty
the
king
is
fettered
politically
bound
by
conflicting
interests
watched
carefully
nursed
by
this
power
and
by
that
he
is
unable
to
move
as
his
people
would
have
him
it
is
for
me
to
act
for
him
in
this
matter
secretly
until
the
appointed
hour
strikes
remember
captain
ellerey
i
am
queen
as
his
majesty
is
king
with
equal
rights
not
as
consort
merely
your
sword
is
pledged
to
me
as
to
the
king
therefore
i
can
demand
your
service
i
prefer
to
ask
it
your
majesty
is
gracious
it
will
be
secret
service
for
the
present
secret
even
from
the
king
i
may
require
it
a
week
hence
or
it
may
be
in
a
time
i
can
not
tell
it
is
perilous
service
but
that
will
not
deter
captain
desmond
ellerey
may
i
claim
your
full
and
perfect
allegiance
i
hold
myself
entirely
at
your
majesty
disposal
you
shall
not
find
me
ungrateful
she
said
giving
him
her
hand
choose
you
a
dozen
stout
men
on
whom
you
can
rely
good
pay
you
may
promise
them
have
them
in
readiness
to
set
out
at
an
hour
notice
then
wait
and
watch
we
shall
call
you
into
private
audience
on
some
occasion
either
personally
or
by
monsieur
de
froilette
and
now
that
we
have
found
the
man
may
the
time
be
quick
in
coming
there
was
delicate
flattery
in
her
words
and
manner
yet
withal
perfect
consciousness
of
her
own
power
the
power
that
beauty
gives
ellerey
felt
the
magic
of
her
influence
and
his
eyes
looked
unflinchingly
into
hers
for
a
moment
the
woman
in
her
understood
what
manner
of
man
he
was
in
whom
she
trusted
if
i
read
you
aright
captain
ellerey
she
said
with
a
radiant
smile
it
is
not
your
nature
to
be
frivolous
to
catch
pleasure
as
it
flies
and
play
with
it
while
the
bubble
lasts
yet
must
you
school
yourself
to
do
so
the
cavalier
and
careless
lover
will
not
be
suspected
of
any
deep
design
and
it
would
be
well
that
that
should
seem
your
character
at
court
more
easily
will
you
keep
the
nearer
to
our
person
for
love
of
pleasure
and
the
gratification
of
the
moment
is
thought
to
be
our
end
and
aim
also
even
his
majesty
is
deceived
in
this
and
knows
not
that
under
the
surface
we
are
working
night
and
day
in
his
cause
monsieur
de
froilette
shall
see
to
it
that
you
have
ample
opportunity
to
be
merry
and
i
promise
you
active
hazardous
service
work
after
your
own
heart
in
the
near
future
in
the
one
as
in
the
other
i
shall
hope
to
win
your
approval
ellerey
answered
the
queen
turned
and
retired
as
quickly
as
she
had
come
de
froilette
bowed
low
as
she
passed
out
but
exchanged
no
word
with
her
nor
did
he
attempt
to
follow
her
her
coming
and
her
going
had
evidently
been
prearranged
for
ellerey
benefit
i
surprise
you
for
the
second
time
said
de
froilette
as
he
closed
the
door
yes
i
expected
another
woman
princess
maritza
de
froilette
started
at
the
name
and
looked
keenly
at
his
companion
for
an
instant
he
showed
surprise
perhaps
annoyance
but
he
was
quickly
himself
again
and
asked
quietly
what
do
you
know
of
the
princess
maritza
i
have
studied
something
of
the
history
of
this
country
in
my
leisure
monsieur
that
is
all
and
i
fancied
you
might
be
interested
yourself
in
the
fortunes
of
the
exile
you
spoke
of
others
with
an
equal
or
better
right
than
his
majesty
i
was
thinking
of
the
queen
the
princess
is
impossible
her
fathers
sat
upon
the
throne
it
is
true
and
by
their
misplaced
ambition
and
folly
not
only
lost
the
support
of
every
foreign
power
but
alienated
the
love
of
the
people
besides
her
father
barely
escaped
assassination
the
princess
is
known
to
me
as
her
father
was
at
present
she
is
in
england
does
she
make
no
claim
for
herself
she
might
were
the
throne
vacant
but
she
could
not
succeed
the
people
would
never
accept
her
in
two
days
will
you
do
me
the
honor
of
accompanying
me
to
court
as
her
majesty
desires
the
honor
will
be
mine
i
thank
you
for
bringing
me
into
notice
ellerey
answered
i
will
come
for
you
at
your
lodging
said
de
froilette
and
then
a
servant
entered
apparently
without
being
summoned
and
in
silence
conducted
ellerey
to
the
bare
hall
again
all
the
doors
were
fast
closed
as
before
but
the
air
seemed
to
vibrate
with
life
and
the
silence
to
be
ready
to
break
into
a
hoarse
roar
of
voices
at
a
notice
yet
only
in
a
window
here
and
there
was
there
a
dim
light
when
ellerey
looked
up
at
the
gloomy
house
as
he
stood
alone
in
the
altstrasse
chapter
iii
the
woman
in
the
silk
mask
once
alone
there
were
many
questions
which
ellerey
regretted
he
had
not
put
to
his
host
and
some
misgivings
arose
in
his
mind
whether
he
had
not
been
led
to
promise
service
which
might
be
contrary
to
the
oath
which
he
had
taken
to
the
king
the
scheme
to
enlist
his
help
had
evidently
been
carefully
considered
and
prepared
with
the
result
that
he
had
pledged
himself
to
some
hazardous
task
of
the
nature
of
which
he
was
entirely
ignorant
not
a
clue
had
been
given
him
and
were
he
desirous
of
turning
traitor
he
realized
that
it
was
not
within
his
power
to
do
so
not
a
word
of
information
could
he
speak
and
who
would
believe
that
alone
and
apparently
unattended
the
queen
had
visited
the
altstrasse
at
midnight
that
she
had
done
so
for
the
purpose
of
speaking
to
him
proved
to
ellerey
that
her
need
for
him
was
urgent
that
she
had
explained
nothing
pointed
to
the
fact
that
she
was
not
inclined
to
trust
him
fully
at
present
i
judge
there
is
work
for
my
sword
he
said
as
he
drew
his
cloak
closer
round
him
it
would
seem
there
is
employment
for
my
wits
also
at
least
i
have
my
wish
a
part
to
play
which
holds
possibilities
a
queen
a
designing
frenchman
and
an
ambitious
captain
of
horse
who
may
be
a
fool
well
the
drama
may
prove
exciting
we
shall
see
desmond
ellerey
was
after
all
an
adventurer
of
the
better
sort
perhaps
driven
to
the
life
by
force
of
circumstances
yet
still
an
adventurer
his
position
proclaimed
him
one
he
looked
for
reward
from
the
country
which
had
purchased
his
sword
and
had
no
inclination
to
fritter
away
his
chances
of
espousing
any
cause
but
the
winning
one
at
the
same
time
he
was
an
englishman
a
birth
privilege
carrying
with
it
weighty
responsibilities
which
he
could
not
away
with
as
easily
as
he
had
cast
aside
his
country
there
were
few
ties
to
bind
him
to
england
he
had
become
that
unenviable
member
of
a
family
the
black
sheep
he
had
run
deeply
into
debt
a
fact
that
had
grievously
told
against
him
when
he
had
to
face
the
accusations
which
had
ruined
his
career
in
withdrawing
from
england
he
had
probably
left
only
two
friends
sir
charles
and
lady
martin
who
would
ever
trouble
to
send
a
kindly
thought
after
him
his
going
had
aroused
the
keenest
satisfaction
in
the
breast
of
his
brother
sir
ralph
ellerey
tenth
baronet
of
the
name
who
was
quite
ready
to
believe
the
very
worst
that
was
said
of
desmond
remarking
that
it
was
little
more
than
he
expected
sir
ralph
cast
of
mind
was
perhaps
narrow
and
ungenerous
but
since
the
sympathy
so
usually
shown
to
the
spendthrift
was
not
forthcoming
in
this
case
it
must
be
assumed
that
popular
opinion
condemned
desmond
ellerey
and
sympathized
with
sir
ralph
it
had
been
easy
therefore
for
desmond
to
become
a
stranger
to
his
native
land
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
forget
that
he
was
an
englishman
that
a
peculiar
code
of
honor
was
demanded
of
him
by
the
fact
the
altstrasse
was
deserted
as
he
passed
through
it
the
lights
were
out
in
most
of
the
houses
and
silence
was
over
the
whole
city
the
sky
was
black
with
clouds
giving
promise
of
heavy
rain
before
morning
if
the
wind
dropped
ellerey
walked
quickly
his
ears
alert
and
his
eyes
keenly
searching
every
shadow
on
either
side
of
him
attacks
in
the
street
for
the
purpose
of
plunder
were
of
too
general
occurrence
to
make
a
lonely
walk
in
sturatzberg
safe
or
desirable
at
night
and
in
this
quarter
of
the
city
help
would
be
slow
in
coming
as
he
turned
out
of
the
altstrasse
a
woman
coming
hastily
in
the
opposite
direction
ran
against
him
and
with
a
faint
cry
started
back
in
fear
a
cloak
was
gathered
tightly
round
her
showing
nothing
of
her
dress
and
little
of
her
figure
and
the
hood
of
it
was
pulled
so
low
down
that
little
of
her
face
was
visible
help
monsieur
she
cried
striving
for
breath
which
came
in
spasmodic
pants
after
her
running
help
monsieur
if
you
be
a
man
how
can
i
serve
you
ah
a
soldier
she
cried
seeing
the
cloak
he
wore
quick
there
is
no
time
to
delay
while
we
speak
murder
is
being
done
where
come
it
is
a
house
yonder
are
you
armed
ah
but
they
are
cowards
and
only
attack
defenceless
women
and
she
plucked
him
by
the
arm
to
compel
him
to
follow
her
she
did
not
appeal
in
vain
show
me
ellerey
said
and
taking
her
hand
that
he
might
help
her
pace
he
ran
with
her
their
footsteps
resounding
along
the
silent
street
as
they
ran
he
tried
to
get
a
better
view
of
her
face
but
in
vain
he
noticed
that
her
cloak
which
flapped
outward
with
every
step
she
took
revealed
a
rich
white
skirt
beneath
and
there
was
the
rustle
of
silk
she
kept
up
bravely
with
him
seeming
to
gain
new
courage
in
his
company
she
led
him
round
two
corners
across
a
dark
square
and
to
the
open
door
of
a
house
in
a
small
street
beyond
quick
they
are
within
straight
up
the
stairs
to
the
first
floor
ellerey
released
his
hold
of
the
girl
indeed
she
pulled
her
hand
away
that
she
might
not
detain
him
from
dashing
to
the
rescue
and
as
he
touched
the
stairs
he
heard
the
door
close
with
a
loud
reverberating
slam
behind
him
quickly
she
cried
after
him
the
house
was
dark
and
quiet
doubly
quiet
it
seemed
now
that
the
door
had
closed
not
a
sound
came
from
the
rooms
above
as
ellerey
went
up
the
stairs
if
murder
were
here
he
had
surely
come
too
late
he
had
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
had
stretched
out
his
hand
to
feel
his
way
by
the
wall
and
had
paused
to
listen
for
a
sound
or
to
discern
a
glimmer
of
light
to
guide
him
when
suddenly
the
air
about
him
seemed
to
break
into
life
and
before
he
had
time
to
turn
and
throw
his
back
against
the
wall
strong
arms
were
about
his
shoulders
and
legs
in
an
instant
ellerey
had
grasped
one
man
in
the
darkness
and
kicked
himself
free
from
a
second
who
went
rolling
down
the
stairs
uttering
curses
as
he
struck
the
balustrade
heavily
making
it
crack
to
breaking
point
another
received
his
heel
squarely
in
the
face
and
dropped
with
a
thud
upon
the
floor
a
thud
that
almost
had
the
sound
of
finality
in
it
meanwhile
the
man
he
had
seized
wrenched
himself
free
and
another
pair
of
arms
were
flung
round
ellerey
waist
obviously
to
prevent
his
getting
at
any
weapon
he
might
carry
ellerey
strained
every
nerve
to
free
himself
from
this
assailant
and
to
get
his
back
to
the
wall
striking
out
right
and
left
now
hitting
a
neck
or
shoulder
now
landing
a
heavy
blow
between
eyes
he
could
not
see
anon
beating
the
air
only
how
many
his
adversaries
were
he
could
not
determine
the
air
was
full
of
panting
breaths
and
growling
imprecations
of
swaying
bodies
and
heavy
blows
which
were
for
the
most
part
wide
of
the
mark
every
moment
ellerey
expected
to
be
his
last
expected
to
feel
the
sharp
thrust
of
a
blade
or
to
fall
into
sudden
oblivion
before
the
sound
of
the
revolver
shot
had
time
to
reach
his
ears
yet
he
still
lived
fighting
struggling
being
slowly
spent
by
the
odds
against
him
why
did
these
murderers
not
end
it
were
they
fearful
of
injuring
a
comrade
in
the
darkness
or
were
they
desirous
of
not
injuring
him
too
severely
indeed
it
seemed
so
had
he
fallen
into
a
trap
baited
with
the
frightened
woman
who
had
petitioned
him
for
help
the
thought
that
he
could
have
been
such
a
fool
that
so
transparent
a
device
should
have
deceived
him
maddened
him
and
he
redoubled
his
exertions
to
free
himself
trying
to
drag
his
assailants
with
him
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
so
that
he
might
fling
himself
and
them
down
and
chance
regaining
his
liberty
in
the
shock
of
the
fall
but
the
men
appeared
to
perceive
his
motive
and
redoubled
their
efforts
too
straining
every
nerve
to
end
the
struggle
the
man
who
held
him
round
the
waist
was
dragged
this
way
and
that
yet
never
for
a
moment
relaxed
his
hold
other
hands
were
upon
his
legs
now
and
ellerey
suddenly
felt
his
feet
drawn
together
with
a
snap
the
next
instant
he
was
thrown
backward
knees
were
pressed
upon
his
chest
his
arms
were
twisted
and
caught
with
a
rope
his
ankles
bound
together
and
he
was
helpless
i
like
to
bury
this
knife
in
your
cursed
carcass
whispered
a
voice
in
his
ear
i
been
expecting
you
to
do
so
said
ellerey
panting
for
breath
why
do
you
i
do
know
by
heaven
i
do
know
why
not
well
i
sure
i
do
panted
ellerey
is
he
secure
said
another
voice
yes
at
least
half
a
dozen
voices
answered
then
drag
him
in
perhaps
we
have
leave
to
despatch
him
presently
a
door
was
opened
and
with
scant
ceremony
ellerey
was
dragged
by
his
feet
across
the
floor
into
a
room
the
door
was
shut
again
and
someone
produced
a
lantern
ellerey
found
himself
lying
in
a
bare
room
with
seven
or
eight
men
standing
in
a
circle
round
him
regarding
him
with
sullen
and
angry
looks
yet
with
curiosity
and
some
respect
and
on
more
than
one
face
there
were
marks
of
the
struggle
savage
flushes
that
would
blacken
and
blood
on
lips
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
but
saw
no
face
he
recognized
yet
they
were
not
such
a
murderous
set
of
scoundrels
as
he
had
expected
to
see
and
although
more
than
one
of
them
perhaps
would
have
taken
the
keenest
pleasure
in
burying
a
in
him
to
revenge
the
hurt
he
had
received
it
appeared
evident
that
some
consideration
held
them
back
whatever
they
contemplated
doing
murder
was
not
their
intention
it
takes
a
lot
to
knock
the
sense
out
of
you
said
one
man
and
ellerey
thought
he
recognized
the
voice
which
had
ordered
him
to
be
dragged
into
the
room
and
there
are
one
or
two
of
us
who
have
something
to
settle
that
must
wait
for
a
more
convenient
season
if
i
am
to
make
a
fight
for
it
it
certainly
must
said
ellerey
with
a
smile
i
suppose
it
no
use
asking
you
to
loosen
my
wrist
a
little
the
cord
is
very
tight
not
a
bit
of
use
may
i
know
why
you
have
trapped
me
in
this
way
i
should
like
to
see
the
little
hussy
who
deceived
me
the
men
laughed
she
a
safe
bait
is
a
woman
all
the
world
over
said
the
spokesman
and
this
one
finished
her
part
of
the
business
well
enough
now
our
parts
have
got
to
be
done
some
time
you
received
a
token
we
want
it
you
are
welcome
to
any
token
i
received
ellerey
answered
give
it
me
then
because
i
received
none
ellerey
added
that
a
lie
said
one
man
it
is
well
for
you
that
i
am
bound
hand
and
foot
said
ellerey
quietly
if
i
remember
your
face
i
may
ask
you
to
repeat
that
some
day
i
ask
you
again
to
give
me
the
token
you
received
once
it
is
in
my
hands
you
are
free
to
depart
said
the
spokesman
and
i
repeat
that
i
received
no
token
answered
ellerey
search
him
cried
several
voices
and
at
a
gesture
from
their
leader
they
fell
on
their
knees
beside
him
it
was
rough
handling
ellerey
received
for
the
next
few
minutes
his
coat
was
torn
open
rough
hands
were
thrust
into
his
pockets
and
even
his
were
rent
apart
lest
by
any
means
he
should
have
secured
the
token
next
his
skin
there
is
nothing
they
said
rising
to
their
feet
one
by
one
the
last
man
knelt
a
moment
longer
and
turned
an
evil
eye
toward
his
chief
may
it
not
happen
by
an
accident
he
said
an
accident
would
be
forgiven
and
it
would
be
so
much
safer
the
dim
light
shone
on
the
keen
blade
the
man
had
ripped
eagerly
from
his
girdle
and
ellerey
doubted
whether
the
chief
word
would
have
power
to
save
him
whether
indeed
it
would
be
spoken
his
salvation
came
from
quite
an
unexpected
quarter
why
that
knife
nicolai
said
a
voice
which
caused
the
man
to
spring
to
his
feet
and
made
ellerey
turn
his
head
you
would
dare
to
disobey
my
commands
nicolai
stand
aside
i
have
no
faith
in
you
the
ruffian
slunk
back
into
the
shadows
of
the
room
without
a
word
ellerey
was
astonished
that
so
mild
a
reprimand
should
have
so
great
an
effect
he
looked
at
the
dim
figure
which
the
mean
light
of
the
lantern
revealed
a
woman
figure
closely
cloaked
from
head
to
foot
while
an
ample
scarf
was
wound
round
her
head
and
her
face
hidden
by
a
silken
mask
she
had
entered
by
a
door
somewhat
behind
him
and
he
and
the
man
who
was
so
desirous
of
killing
him
were
the
last
to
become
aware
of
her
presence
have
you
found
it
she
demanded
after
a
pause
no
he
declares
no
token
was
given
at
any
rate
it
is
not
upon
him
answered
the
man
who
was
in
charge
of
the
ruffians
the
woman
took
the
lantern
from
the
man
who
carried
it
and
as
she
held
it
up
saw
more
distinctly
the
faces
of
the
men
about
her
he
has
given
you
trouble
it
seems
you
bear
marks
of
the
conflict
eight
of
you
and
two
on
the
stairs
who
have
not
yet
recovered
said
one
he
should
be
a
good
man
then
for
a
hazardous
enterprise
and
the
woman
bent
down
holding
the
lantern
low
to
look
into
ellerey
face
ellerey
could
see
the
eyes
through
the
holes
in
the
silk
mask
but
they
told
him
nothing
he
had
hardly
noticed
the
eyes
of
the
woman
who
had
stopped
him
at
the
corner
of
the
altstrasse
he
did
not
know
whether
they
were
the
same
this
woman
seemed
taller
yet
there
was
a
familiar
ring
in
her
voice
she
gazed
at
him
for
some
moments
in
silence
and
then
standing
erect
handed
the
lantern
to
one
of
the
men
behind
the
mask
she
smiled
your
madam
have
made
a
mistake
i
have
no
token
said
ellerey
do
any
of
you
know
this
man
she
asked
turning
to
her
followers
a
foreigner
growled
one
a
soldier
said
another
a
king
man
said
a
third
and
better
put
out
of
the
way
if
i
may
advise
you
would
be
as
nicolai
yonder
under
my
displeasure
she
answered
sharply
have
a
care
i
shall
know
how
to
deal
with
the
first
man
who
disobeys
me
was
this
the
queen
ellerey
thought
she
must
be
he
recognized
something
familiar
in
her
manner
was
this
her
method
of
proving
his
daring
before
she
fully
trusted
him
you
have
no
token
she
said
addressing
ellerey
no
madam
yet
you
went
on
a
secret
mission
to
the
altstrasse
i
went
openly
openly
to
visit
whom
surely
one
who
lives
in
the
altstrasse
ellerey
answered
and
were
graciously
entertained
i
ate
and
drank
madam
and
both
food
and
drink
seemed
to
me
of
excellent
quality
and
afterward
we
talked
monsieur
de
froilette
you
and
yes
madam
we
talked
and
smoked
but
the
matter
of
the
token
surprises
me
i
heard
no
word
of
such
a
thing
mentioned
i
am
inclined
to
believe
you
she
answered
you
have
not
yet
been
sufficiently
proved
i
would
bow
my
thanks
for
your
compliment
were
i
able
i
make
but
a
sorry
picture
at
the
moment
i
fear
but
my
ragged
and
hardly
respectable
appearance
you
will
excuse
may
i
know
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
this
adventure
not
yet
i
may
have
need
of
you
again
an
invitation
less
hastily
devised
would
please
me
better
said
ellery
i
am
not
rich
enough
to
adventure
such
good
garments
as
these
often
a
bullet
would
certainly
have
made
less
havoc
with
them
captain
ellerey
she
returned
the
mention
of
his
name
startled
him
a
word
of
warning
she
went
on
beware
of
monsieur
de
froilette
and
of
any
enterprise
he
may
handle
there
will
be
specious
promises
but
small
fulfilment
beware
of
the
lady
who
visited
the
altstrasse
hesitate
to
do
her
bidding
unless
i
mistake
not
you
will
thank
me
for
the
warning
one
day
and
then
turning
to
the
men
about
her
she
said
unloose
him
they
hesitated
and
did
not
move
unloose
him
i
say
and
she
stamped
her
foot
sharply
two
or
three
fell
on
their
knees
beside
ellerey
and
unfastened
the
cords
and
stretching
his
limbs
to
take
some
of
the
ache
out
of
them
he
rose
to
his
feet
you
are
free
she
said
but
for
the
safety
of
these
men
you
must
consent
to
be
blindfolded
and
led
to
the
place
you
came
from
by
the
same
lady
who
brought
me
here
ellerey
inquired
that
might
hardly
be
to
her
liking
was
the
answer
at
a
sign
from
her
ellerey
eyes
were
bound
with
a
scarf
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
being
guided
along
the
streets
one
moment
monsieur
said
one
of
his
guides
presently
there
are
footsteps
surely
ellerey
stood
still
and
waited
listening
he
heard
no
footsteps
and
presently
did
not
perceive
the
breathing
of
the
man
beside
him
then
he
understood
the
ruse
and
tore
the
bandage
from
his
eyes
he
was
alone
at
the
corner
of
the
altstrasse
and
the
rain
was
beating
slantwise
into
his
face
chapter
iv
the
court
of
sturatzberg
ellerey
servant
had
fallen
asleep
on
a
settle
partly
induced
perhaps
by
the
liquor
the
empty
tankard
beside
him
had
held
but
he
started
wide
awake
on
the
instant
as
his
master
entered
ellery
expected
him
to
remark
upon
his
sorry
condition
as
he
threw
off
his
cloak
but
the
man
did
not
do
so
there
has
been
some
rough
handling
in
my
neighborhood
stefan
that
plain
enough
captain
was
the
answer
they
were
good
clothes
too
and
interest
you
more
than
the
man
inside
them
said
ellerey
grimly
for
the
moment
yes
the
man
is
unhurt
while
the
clothes
are
only
fit
for
the
or
to
be
given
to
me
and
for
choice
you
would
sooner
have
a
corpse
to
deal
with
so
that
the
clothes
were
untorn
stefan
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
could
spare
most
of
my
acquaintances
to
be
made
corpses
of
for
acquaintances
are
easier
come
by
than
good
clothes
it
was
a
street
attack
captain
i
suppose
they
are
common
enough
in
sturatzberg
ellerey
answered
lightly
the
tale
will
serve
as
well
as
another
stefan
returned
if
i
tell
it
i
am
not
compelled
to
believe
it
and
if
i
chance
to
be
lying
it
is
no
sin
of
mine
why
rascal
what
else
should
it
be
it
might
be
a
friend
turned
enemy
or
the
pursuit
of
a
woman
or
the
touching
of
one
of
the
many
intrigues
in
sturatzberg
but
let
it
be
a
street
attack
was
any
man
left
sobbing
out
his
life
in
the
corner
of
the
wall
it
is
well
to
have
the
story
complete
no
it
was
an
encounter
of
blows
and
bruises
only
in
such
a
plight
as
yours
most
men
would
have
had
some
boast
to
make
pointing
to
their
own
condition
to
prove
their
statements
i
have
heard
of
half
a
dozen
men
lying
dead
or
dying
at
a
street
corner
victims
to
a
single
sword
yet
was
there
never
a
corpse
to
be
found
in
the
morning
your
easy
boaster
is
ever
a
ready
liar
patch
up
the
clothes
and
wear
them
stefan
if
you
can
persuade
your
bulk
into
them
laughed
ellerey
some
day
perhaps
when
i
am
certain
of
your
affection
i
may
tell
you
more
of
the
adventure
and
ask
your
help
the
man
took
up
the
tankard
looked
into
its
emptiness
and
put
it
down
again
then
he
turned
round
suddenly
some
time
since
i
was
offered
higher
pay
to
serve
another
master
captain
why
did
you
go
i
beginning
to
think
i
was
a
fool
since
you
trust
me
so
little
stefan
answered
but
i
may
yet
prove
a
better
comrade
in
a
tight
place
than
many
a
soldier
one
of
his
own
troop
of
horse
stefan
had
drifted
into
ellerey
service
perhaps
because
he
was
a
lonely
man
like
his
master
he
appeared
to
have
no
ties
whatever
nor
wanted
any
and
declared
that
the
first
man
he
met
in
the
street
who
was
old
enough
might
be
his
father
for
anything
he
knew
to
the
contrary
his
mother
he
knew
had
died
bringing
him
into
the
world
a
wasted
sacrifice
he
called
it
since
the
world
could
have
done
very
well
without
him
and
he
without
it
being
in
it
he
took
all
the
good
he
could
find
and
if
he
held
his
own
life
cheaply
he
was
even
less
interested
in
the
lives
of
others
women
he
hated
and
his
good
opinion
could
be
purchased
by
a
man
for
a
brimming
tankard
and
lasted
as
a
rule
so
long
as
any
liquor
remained
it
was
hardly
wonderful
that
ellerey
should
not
trust
such
a
man
with
any
secret
of
his
yet
the
soldier
parting
words
and
the
look
on
his
face
as
he
spoke
made
him
thoughtful
i
shall
want
at
least
one
stout
companion
on
whom
i
can
rely
he
mused
i
might
choose
a
worse
man
than
stefan
he
spoke
of
his
adventure
to
no
one
else
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
locate
the
house
into
which
he
had
been
decoyed
to
show
too
much
interest
in
the
affair
would
only
be
to
attract
attention
to
himself
and
his
movements
which
was
undesirable
whether
it
were
her
majesty
who
had
taken
occasion
to
test
his
courage
or
others
who
knowing
the
queen
schemes
sought
to
defeat
them
one
thing
appeared
certain
some
token
was
to
come
into
his
possession
and
was
to
bring
peril
with
it
on
the
second
evening
ellerey
accompanied
monsieur
de
froilette
to
court
you
are
prepared
to
be
frivolous
monsieur
as
her
majesty
wishes
said
de
froilette
as
they
went
you
will
find
it
tolerably
easy
but
pardon
the
advice
make
few
friends
they
are
a
danger
to
one
with
a
secret
mission
do
you
speak
of
men
monsieur
or
women
ellerey
asked
i
spoke
generally
but
perhaps
i
was
thinking
of
women
was
the
answer
of
one
man
however
beware
there
is
a
little
devil
at
court
who
can
spy
out
secrets
almost
before
they
are
conceived
the
english
ambassador
lord
cloverton
he
is
a
great
man
and
i
hate
him
ellerey
had
no
time
to
ask
questions
for
the
carriage
stopped
and
the
next
moment
he
was
following
de
froilette
up
the
wide
staircase
which
many
people
men
and
women
were
ascending
his
companion
spoke
to
no
one
as
he
went
up
nor
did
anyone
address
him
to
the
casual
observer
he
might
have
passed
for
an
unimportant
personage
in
that
gay
throng
but
ellerey
who
had
every
reason
to
be
interested
in
the
frenchman
noticed
that
many
people
turned
to
look
after
him
whispering
together
when
he
had
passed
ellerey
himself
attracted
some
little
attention
due
he
imagined
to
the
fact
that
he
was
in
de
company
until
he
chanced
to
be
left
alone
for
a
few
moments
at
the
head
of
the
grand
staircase
some
paces
from
him
four
men
were
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
from
their
position
they
could
scrutinize
every
one
who
ascended
the
stairs
or
crossed
the
vestibule
and
it
seemed
to
ellerey
they
were
there
of
set
purpose
more
that
his
arrival
had
been
expected
and
waited
for
one
of
the
four
was
a
man
of
about
his
own
age
richly
dressed
and
of
distinguished
bearing
he
appeared
chief
among
his
companions
who
addressed
him
with
a
certain
deference
and
followed
his
movements
so
that
when
he
turned
to
look
at
the
newcomer
ellerey
found
himself
the
focus
of
four
pairs
of
eyes
he
met
their
searching
looks
with
equal
inquiry
but
experienced
a
certain
attraction
toward
the
man
who
led
the
scrutiny
he
might
be
an
enemy
but
he
looked
as
though
he
would
prove
an
honest
and
open
one
incapable
of
anything
mean
or
underhand
presently
he
made
some
remark
to
his
companions
who
nodded
acquiescence
and
then
they
separated
and
were
lost
in
the
crowd
crossing
the
vestibule
just
as
de
froilette
returned
pardon
me
for
leaving
you
monsieur
shall
we
seek
her
majesty
ellerey
passed
with
the
frenchman
into
a
magnificent
room
brilliantly
lighted
from
a
domed
roof
one
of
a
suite
of
rooms
which
were
all
of
splendid
proportions
from
the
distance
came
soft
dreamy
music
hushed
in
the
murmur
of
voices
there
were
a
great
many
people
present
and
dancing
had
commenced
in
the
it
was
a
brave
assembly
men
wearing
brilliant
uniforms
and
the
decorations
of
every
nation
in
europe
and
women
beautiful
in
themselves
glorious
in
sheen
of
satin
rustle
of
silk
and
flash
of
jewels
women
light
laughter
answered
men
jests
on
every
side
were
gayety
and
careless
acceptance
of
the
pleasures
of
the
passing
hour
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
under
it
all
lay
deceit
and
treachery
ellerey
was
inclined
to
doubt
it
as
he
followed
his
companion
in
one
of
the
rooms
surrounded
by
a
group
of
men
and
women
with
whom
she
turned
to
speak
and
laugh
between
the
welcome
she
extended
to
each
new
arrival
sat
her
majesty
she
was
even
more
beautiful
than
when
she
had
come
to
the
altstrasse
and
surrounded
as
she
was
by
beautiful
women
seemed
to
hold
by
right
the
central
position
of
the
group
jewels
glistened
at
her
throat
and
in
her
hair
and
across
her
breast
she
wore
the
scarlet
ribbon
of
the
golden
lion
of
sturatzberg
ah
monsieur
de
froilette
you
are
welcome
she
said
i
was
just
saying
that
your
countrywomen
are
the
most
accomplished
the
most
fascinating
in
europe
and
count
von
heinnen
laughs
at
my
opinion
your
majesty
will
not
understand
said
von
heinnen
in
guttural
tones
which
ill
agreed
with
a
compliment
i
loved
the
women
of
france
until
i
arrived
in
sturatzberg
i
would
narrow
the
count
limit
and
say
the
palace
of
sturatzberg
said
de
froilette
bending
over
the
queen
hand
no
word
for
the
women
of
their
own
country
laughed
the
queen
are
we
so
unpatriotic
baron
petrescu
and
she
turned
to
a
man
who
was
standing
close
behind
her
i
fear
so
your
majesty
i
have
been
in
england
and
for
my
part
i
think
the
english
women
are
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
baron
petrescu
was
the
man
who
had
looked
so
searchingly
at
ellerey
in
the
vestibule
he
looked
at
him
now
as
though
his
answer
had
some
reference
to
him
and
the
queen
who
did
not
seem
too
pleased
with
the
frankly
spoken
answer
following
the
direction
of
the
baron
glance
let
her
eyes
rest
on
ellerey
for
the
first
time
captain
ellerey
you
too
are
welcome
she
said
you
come
but
seldom
to
court
as
an
englishman
you
will
doubtless
support
the
baron
opinion
i
find
something
to
contemplate
in
all
women
your
majesty
but
as
yet
i
have
placed
none
above
all
others
that
confession
should
fire
feminine
ambition
in
sturatzberg
laughed
the
queen
spread
the
report
of
it
monsieur
de
froilette
and
we
shall
witness
excellent
comedy
or
tragedy
i
hardly
know
which
love
may
be
oh
you
are
doubly
welcome
captain
ellerey
for
the
sport
you
shall
give
us
and
we
will
ask
for
a
repetition
of
that
confession
constantly
the
first
time
you
look
down
before
our
questioning
eyes
and
stammer
in
your
answer
we
shall
know
that
love
has
laid
siege
to
the
citadel
of
indifference
and
captured
it
ellerey
smiled
as
he
moved
aside
to
make
room
for
others
he
would
have
approached
baron
petrescu
had
he
been
able
to
do
so
but
he
was
prevented
first
because
someone
who
knew
him
slightly
spoke
to
him
and
secondly
by
a
general
movement
in
the
room
occasioned
by
the
king
entrance
when
the
history
of
ferdinand
iv
comes
to
be
written
the
king
will
probably
have
as
many
characters
as
he
has
biographers
the
character
given
him
will
so
entirely
depend
upon
the
point
of
view
as
he
walked
slowly
across
the
room
his
manner
was
not
without
dignity
but
had
little
graciousness
in
it
there
were
a
few
who
feared
him
many
who
despised
him
some
who
hated
him
and
from
east
to
west
of
his
kingdom
it
is
doubtful
whether
a
dozen
loved
or
admired
him
in
appearance
he
was
tall
and
thin
with
a
stoop
in
his
shoulders
his
skin
was
and
his
eyes
heavy
and
slow
of
movement
europe
plaything
a
witty
frenchman
had
once
called
him
but
those
about
him
found
it
hard
work
often
to
make
him
dance
to
their
piping
perhaps
no
one
understood
him
better
or
had
greater
influence
with
him
than
the
man
who
now
walked
a
pace
or
two
behind
him
and
was
so
small
that
beside
the
king
he
looked
almost
ridiculous
his
mincing
gait
and
his
apparently
nervous
deference
to
everyone
about
him
would
have
amused
those
who
did
not
know
the
man
or
until
they
had
made
a
more
careful
study
of
his
face
nature
seemed
to
have
tried
her
hand
at
a
caricature
and
had
placed
upon
this
diminutive
body
a
leonine
head
the
face
was
a
network
of
lines
as
though
wind
rain
and
sunshine
had
worked
their
will
upon
it
for
years
the
hair
was
white
as
driven
snow
and
thick
shaggy
and
long
while
set
deeply
under
heavy
brows
his
small
eyes
were
never
still
for
a
fraction
of
time
they
seemed
to
rest
on
everyone
in
turn
and
to
note
something
about
them
which
would
be
stored
up
in
the
memory
a
devil
monsieur
is
it
not
so
whispered
de
froilette
in
ellerey
ear
after
the
ambassador
had
passed
he
has
already
noted
your
presence
and
will
know
all
about
you
before
he
sleeps
if
he
ever
does
sleep
we
must
be
very
frivolous
to
escape
detection
to
be
frivolous
at
the
court
of
sturatzberg
was
no
difficult
matter
whether
it
was
the
report
of
what
he
had
said
to
the
queen
had
made
him
especially
interesting
to
women
or
whether
those
steady
blue
eyes
of
his
were
the
attraction
ellerey
found
it
easy
to
make
friends
he
studied
to
catch
the
trick
of
pleasing
with
a
light
compliment
or
pleasant
jest
and
before
many
days
had
gone
had
earned
a
reputation
as
an
irresponsible
cavalier
one
whom
it
would
be
dangerous
to
take
too
seriously
or
believe
in
too
thoroughly
such
a
man
was
for
the
most
part
after
the
heart
of
the
feminine
portion
of
the
sturatzberg
court
and
that
he
played
the
part
well
the
queen
smile
constantly
assured
him
in
one
point
however
ellerey
was
peculiarly
unsuccessful
he
had
been
attracted
to
baron
petrescu
and
went
to
some
trouble
to
become
acquainted
with
him
but
to
no
purpose
either
the
baron
avoided
him
intentionally
or
a
train
of
adverse
circumstances
intervened
not
a
single
word
passed
between
them
on
several
occasions
the
queen
made
ellerey
repeat
his
confession
and
he
did
so
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
i
expected
downcast
eyes
and
a
stammering
tongue
she
said
one
evening
and
as
ellerey
looked
at
her
she
glanced
swiftly
across
the
room
toward
a
small
group
of
which
a
woman
was
the
centre
a
beautiful
woman
with
a
silvery
laugh
which
had
the
spirit
and
joy
of
youth
in
it
by
common
consent
her
beauty
had
no
rival
in
the
court
of
sturatzberg
men
whose
tastes
on
all
else
were
as
wide
asunder
as
the
poles
were
at
one
in
praise
of
her
and
even
women
were
content
to
let
her
reign
supreme
her
dark
eyes
fringed
with
long
lashes
were
perhaps
the
most
perfect
feature
of
a
perfect
face
they
could
persuade
they
could
reprove
and
it
was
dangerous
to
look
into
them
too
constantly
if
one
would
not
be
a
slave
her
hair
which
had
a
wave
in
it
and
was
rich
in
color
was
gathered
in
loose
coils
about
her
head
a
veritable
crown
to
her
and
her
voice
was
low
as
if
compelling
you
to
listen
to
some
sweet
secret
it
had
to
tell
a
secret
that
was
only
for
you
i
can
still
make
my
confession
your
majesty
said
ellerey
wondering
whether
his
words
were
quite
true
for
he
had
looked
into
this
eyes
many
times
then
he
went
toward
the
group
quick
to
observe
that
baron
petrescu
left
it
at
his
coming
ellerey
understood
that
the
queen
must
have
watched
him
carefully
to
this
woman
he
had
certainly
paid
more
attention
than
to
any
other
she
was
in
close
attendance
upon
the
queen
was
treated
by
her
with
marked
favor
and
many
envious
and
angry
glances
had
been
cast
upon
ellerey
because
she
seemed
to
find
pleasure
in
being
with
him
ellerey
could
not
deny
that
the
time
spent
in
her
company
sped
faster
than
all
other
hours
but
he
had
another
reason
for
seeking
her
so
persistently
he
had
seen
little
of
the
face
of
the
woman
who
had
cried
to
him
for
help
that
night
at
the
corner
of
the
altstrasse
being
more
concerned
with
what
was
required
of
him
than
with
her
who
petitioned
but
somehow
this
woman
always
reminded
him
of
that
night
whenever
she
walked
beside
him
he
recalled
that
other
woman
who
had
run
with
him
through
the
deserted
streets
was
she
the
woman
or
at
least
was
she
aware
of
what
had
occurred
that
night
why
had
she
so
easily
given
him
her
friendship
why
should
she
so
obviously
prefer
his
company
to
that
of
others
there
was
some
reason
and
yet
she
had
made
no
confession
had
stepped
into
none
of
his
carefully
prepared
traps
did
she
know
maritza
were
those
maritza
eyes
which
had
looked
through
the
silken
mask
you
will
dance
with
me
countess
she
placed
her
hand
upon
his
arm
at
once
you
are
ever
generous
to
me
he
said
as
they
went
toward
the
i
wonder
why
she
looked
up
at
him
he
might
have
been
laughed
at
for
not
understanding
such
a
look
a
captain
of
horse
is
a
small
person
in
sturatzberg
he
said
carelessly
even
if
he
is
honored
with
her
majesty
friendship
she
asked
is
he
well
are
you
not
i
can
judge
by
what
i
see
and
you
seem
welcome
always
i
have
noticed
that
countess
and
have
thought
sometimes
that
you
might
tell
me
the
reason
of
her
majesty
welcome
do
you
mean
of
her
welcome
and
of
your
own
kindness
to
me
ellerey
answered
the
woman
laughed
i
think
englishmen
are
slow
of
comprehension
she
said
but
a
captain
of
horse
countess
who
may
be
of
much
higher
rank
and
in
his
own
country
may
be
ah
you
know
so
many
come
to
sturatzberg
many
vagabonds
countess
oh
yes
and
others
and
then
she
made
a
gesture
that
they
should
dance
and
they
floated
gracefully
out
among
the
couples
gliding
over
the
floor
of
the
ballroom
to
the
strains
of
a
sensuous
german
waltz
ellerey
danced
well
he
had
earned
the
reputation
in
many
a
london
and
the
countess
frina
danced
as
few
english
women
can
with
the
soul
of
the
music
in
her
feet
those
others
are
sometimes
difficult
to
distinguish
ellerey
said
presently
not
to
a
woman
was
the
answer
she
has
an
intuition
which
is
denied
to
most
men
indeed
i
only
know
one
man
who
has
it
in
the
fullest
sense
in
greater
measure
even
than
most
women
and
he
is
an
englishman
curiously
enough
yonder
with
a
touch
she
directed
ellerey
attention
to
one
side
of
the
room
where
lord
cloverton
was
standing
talking
to
two
men
he
seemed
to
be
interested
in
the
conversation
but
at
the
same
time
took
notice
of
every
couple
which
glided
by
him
ellerey
thought
the
eyes
rested
upon
him
for
a
moment
although
he
did
not
go
near
him
he
too
has
noted
you
the
countess
whispered
and
if
you
have
aught
to
conceal
captain
ellerey
take
care
that
the
secret
be
well
buried
or
those
small
eyes
will
spy
it
out
you
do
not
like
the
ambassador
said
ellerey
as
he
guided
his
partner
to
a
deserted
seat
in
an
alcove
i
admire
him
it
is
not
the
same
thing
but
admiration
i
can
not
help
there
would
have
been
desperate
work
for
you
soldiers
long
since
had
it
not
been
for
lord
cloverton
and
that
would
have
pleased
you
it
would
have
given
my
friends
a
chance
of
distinction
she
answered
and
turned
some
friends
into
enemies
countess
surely
you
must
know
that
there
are
such
conflicting
interests
in
sturatzberg
i
have
taken
great
care
in
choosing
my
friends
she
answered
ah
then
you
have
a
very
definite
idea
to
which
interest
you
are
attached
of
course
and
which
is
it
he
asked
in
a
whisper
leaning
toward
her
the
same
as
monsieur
she
said
ellerey
was
baffled
he
had
expected
to
surprise
her
into
a
confession
he
did
not
suppose
he
had
subjugated
this
woman
so
completely
that
she
would
make
her
interests
identical
with
his
own
and
he
could
only
explain
her
answer
by
presuming
that
she
was
sufficiently
in
the
confidence
to
know
something
of
the
mission
to
which
he
stood
pledged
you
seem
very
certain
of
me
countess
have
i
not
said
that
i
take
great
care
in
choosing
my
friends
i
can
not
conceive
any
reason
for
your
faith
in
me
unless
well
you
may
question
me
i
had
lately
a
strange
adventure
countess
in
which
a
woman
was
concerned
she
found
me
after
midnight
at
the
corner
of
the
altstrasse
and
monsieur
monsieur
she
exclaimed
holding
up
her
hand
do
you
imagine
i
should
visit
the
altstrasse
for
my
politics
and
after
midnight
too
i
confess
that
was
in
my
mind
it
pleases
you
to
jest
captain
ellerey
and
i
am
in
no
mood
for
such
jesting
she
rose
and
he
was
forced
to
take
her
from
the
ballroom
he
had
succeeded
in
making
her
angry
and
had
gained
nothing
he
had
been
to
question
her
you
must
pardon
me
he
said
you
must
earn
your
pardon
monsieur
was
her
answer
as
she
turned
away
with
another
partner
who
had
approached
leaving
ellerey
perplexed
a
love
quarrel
monsieur
i
have
noted
several
they
are
frequent
here
at
the
slight
touch
on
his
arm
ellerey
turned
to
face
lord
cloverton
hardly
a
quarrel
my
lord
certainly
not
a
love
one
he
said
i
was
mistaken
then
or
you
think
so
captain
ellerey
love
is
a
curious
disease
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
difficult
to
diagnose
sometimes
in
the
court
of
sturatzberg
one
has
ample
opportunity
of
studying
it
i
may
be
right
after
all
captain
ellerey
i
have
more
knowledge
of
this
court
than
you
have
i
have
spent
a
longer
time
in
it
lord
cloverton
moved
forward
smiling
evidently
expecting
ellerey
to
walk
beside
him
across
the
room
i
endeavor
to
fit
myself
to
my
surroundings
ellerey
said
as
he
walked
slowly
by
the
ambassador
side
striving
in
vain
to
accommodate
his
step
to
the
mincing
gait
of
his
companion
quite
so
but
it
is
hardly
the
best
atmosphere
for
a
young
man
to
develop
himself
in
perhaps
not
you
interest
me
captain
ellerey
since
when
my
lord
the
small
eyes
were
turned
upon
him
for
a
moment
as
though
to
gauge
the
full
meaning
of
the
question
and
they
looked
into
steady
blue
eyes
which
perhaps
made
lord
cloverton
more
interested
than
ever
although
he
did
not
say
so
you
are
thinking
that
i
might
have
taken
notice
of
a
countryman
before
this
he
replied
well
perhaps
there
is
something
in
the
thought
still
you
were
not
brought
to
my
notice
at
the
embassy
i
heard
no
mention
of
desmond
ellerey
as
a
friend
of
anyone
connected
with
the
embassy
nor
indeed
any
remark
that
an
english
officer
was
serving
his
majesty
the
king
of
wallaria
no
my
lord
my
friendships
are
few
and
in
truth
i
have
no
great
desire
to
increase
the
number
i
might
indeed
repeat
your
question
since
when
laughed
lord
cloverton
for
lately
surely
you
have
made
many
new
acquaintances
and
move
in
the
sunshine
of
royal
favor
i
am
afraid
i
have
not
been
conscious
of
the
fact
ellerey
returned
i
must
be
more
careful
to
study
his
majesty
i
was
speaking
of
the
queen
ellerey
looked
at
lord
cloverton
in
astonishment
indeed
i
think
you
are
mistaken
her
majesty
is
very
gracious
to
all
i
do
not
think
she
has
been
especially
so
to
me
another
mistake
of
mine
said
the
ambassador
with
a
smile
i
am
full
of
them
they
began
immediately
after
dinner
i
dropped
two
lumps
of
sugar
into
my
coffee
instead
of
one
it
made
it
abominable
and
i
had
to
leave
it
but
there
is
another
reason
why
i
have
become
interested
in
you
lately
i
heard
that
you
were
the
brother
of
sir
ralph
ellerey
i
know
sir
ralph
we
are
certainly
sons
of
the
same
father
our
relationship
has
got
no
further
than
that
if
you
know
my
brother
well
enough
to
accept
his
opinion
about
me
you
have
doubtless
accorded
me
a
very
low
place
in
your
estimation
i
am
supposed
never
to
accept
another
man
opinion
about
anything
the
ambassador
replied
certainly
i
seldom
do
in
judging
men
i
come
in
contact
with
sir
ralph
however
gives
some
prominence
to
the
name
of
ellerey
and
his
brother
can
hardly
hope
to
pass
through
the
world
unnoticed
i
am
succeeding
beyond
my
expectations
said
ellerey
are
you
believe
me
my
lord
i
am
they
were
standing
apart
in
a
corner
of
one
of
the
rooms
there
was
no
one
near
enough
to
overhear
their
conversation
lord
cloverton
glanced
over
his
shoulder
to
make
sure
of
this
before
he
went
on
quietly
i
have
heard
that
desmond
ellerey
was
obliged
to
leave
a
crack
cavalry
regiment
on
account
of
his
cheating
at
cards
and
for
other
dishonorable
practices
i
took
you
to
be
this
same
desmond
ellerey
yet
another
mistake
my
lord
ellerey
answered
looking
the
ambassador
unflinchingly
in
the
eye
the
desmond
ellerey
you
speak
of
was
an
unfortunate
english
gentleman
and
honorable
soldier
whose
services
his
king
and
country
had
no
further
need
of
he
was
foully
murdered
by
a
lie
the
desmond
ellerey
who
has
the
honor
to
speak
to
you
is
a
captain
of
horse
in
the
service
of
his
majesty
ferdinand
iv
of
wallaria
and
looks
for
favor
and
reward
only
from
the
king
and
country
he
serves
he
turned
on
his
heel
as
he
spoke
and
the
ambassador
stood
looking
after
him
until
his
figure
was
lost
in
the
moving
crowd
chapter
two
visitors
lord
cloverton
sat
in
his
private
room
at
the
embassy
a
knitted
brow
and
lips
showing
that
he
was
deeply
occupied
in
a
problem
which
either
baffled
him
altogether
or
which
having
been
solved
gave
him
considerable
anxiety
he
had
pushed
his
chair
back
from
the
table
and
his
attention
was
concentrated
on
the
papers
he
held
in
his
hand
they
had
come
during
the
past
few
days
and
although
he
had
read
each
one
carefully
on
its
arrival
he
had
put
them
aside
until
he
could
study
them
together
they
were
all
before
him
now
and
he
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
morning
reading
them
and
in
piecing
together
the
information
they
contained
into
one
complete
and
intelligible
story
it
was
not
an
easy
task
and
the
result
he
arrived
at
gave
him
little
satisfaction
this
pestilential
fellow
will
make
trouble
for
us
he
said
to
himself
and
then
he
went
systematically
through
the
letters
again
absolutely
no
doubt
of
his
guilt
he
read
slowly
from
one
of
them
he
denied
everything
of
course
but
the
evidence
was
exceedingly
strong
against
him
that
he
accepted
the
verdict
and
disappeared
in
the
manner
he
did
would
seem
to
confirm
the
truth
that
is
what
i
can
not
understand
said
the
ambassador
arguing
the
point
to
the
empty
room
why
did
he
accept
it
and
disappear
why
did
he
stand
and
face
the
frowning
world
and
beat
it
that
is
what
i
should
have
expected
from
such
a
man
and
with
such
eyes
too
he
took
up
another
paper
the
question
can
hardly
be
reopened
my
lord
and
since
it
was
closed
nothing
has
transpired
to
suggest
that
there
was
any
error
of
justice
in
the
matter
of
course
he
might
bring
an
action
for
slander
in
the
civil
courts
and
for
this
purpose
be
persuaded
to
return
to
england
the
ambassador
shook
his
head
he
had
not
much
faith
in
persuasion
in
this
case
then
he
turned
to
another
letter
and
read
one
paragraph
in
it
more
than
once
it
impressed
him
feel
convinced
that
desmond
ellerey
is
an
innocent
man
one
has
such
convictions
without
being
able
to
explain
them
that
he
accepted
the
inevitable
i
think
i
can
understand
considering
the
weight
of
evidence
against
him
and
although
i
endeavored
to
persuade
him
against
his
determination
to
offer
his
sword
to
another
country
i
can
appreciate
his
point
of
view
since
his
career
had
been
ruined
in
his
own
if
you
think
any
good
will
come
of
my
writing
to
him
making
on
my
own
account
the
suggestion
contained
in
your
letter
i
will
certainly
do
so
and
shall
of
course
not
mention
that
i
have
heard
from
you
or
that
we
are
known
to
each
other
the
ambassador
looked
at
the
signature
martin
an
excellent
man
to
have
for
a
friend
and
i
believe
he
is
right
he
turned
over
another
paper
signed
ralph
ellerey
he
does
not
count
said
the
ambassador
with
a
gesture
of
contempt
and
threw
the
letter
aside
without
troubling
to
read
it
again
then
he
rang
a
bell
upon
his
table
and
a
man
entered
ask
captain
ward
to
come
to
me
the
ambassador
was
pacing
the
room
with
little
short
steps
when
the
captain
entered
do
you
know
a
desmond
ellerey
who
lodges
by
the
western
gate
ward
i
know
there
is
such
a
man
but
i
know
nothing
about
him
he
is
likely
to
be
dangerous
i
want
you
to
keep
an
eye
upon
his
movements
he
is
friendly
with
monsieur
de
froilette
and
is
in
her
majesty
favor
i
do
not
want
you
to
make
ellerey
acquaintance
i
do
want
him
to
know
who
you
are
for
the
present
at
any
rate
i
understand
i
should
be
glad
to
see
him
turn
his
back
upon
wallaria
failing
that
i
am
uncharitable
enough
to
hope
he
may
meet
with
an
accident
said
lord
cloverton
that
might
be
arranged
was
the
answer
sturatzberg
is
having
a
bad
effect
upon
your
moral
sense
at
least
we
will
try
persuasion
first
and
it
was
difficult
to
tell
from
the
ambassador
smiling
face
whether
a
sinister
thought
had
entered
his
head
or
not
after
a
moment
pause
he
added
will
you
also
have
a
telegram
sent
to
sir
charles
martin
just
say
write
cloverton
he
will
understand
the
extent
of
the
ambassador
interest
in
him
would
have
surprised
ellerey
considerably
had
he
known
of
it
after
his
interview
with
lord
cloverton
he
had
that
he
would
seek
to
question
him
further
or
if
he
had
any
reason
to
suppose
he
was
in
his
way
might
bring
pressure
to
bear
upon
the
king
to
dismiss
him
from
the
army
he
certainly
did
not
do
the
one
and
ellerey
had
no
reason
to
think
he
had
attempted
to
do
the
other
at
court
the
ambassador
had
bowed
slightly
as
he
passed
him
and
the
flicker
of
a
smile
had
been
on
his
face
for
a
moment
when
he
saw
him
crossing
the
room
with
countess
mavrodin
almost
as
though
he
wished
him
to
remember
what
he
had
said
about
a
lovers
quarrel
ellerey
had
made
his
peace
with
the
countess
as
speedily
as
possible
he
was
likely
to
make
so
many
enemies
that
he
could
not
afford
to
lose
a
friend
and
he
felt
that
this
woman
was
a
friend
he
had
duly
humbled
himself
and
had
been
forgiven
and
even
when
she
questioned
him
about
his
adventure
in
the
altstrasse
he
refused
to
speak
of
it
lest
he
should
again
offend
he
succeeded
as
he
hoped
to
do
in
raising
her
curiosity
but
if
this
woman
so
resembled
me
surely
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
know
something
more
about
her
she
said
it
was
dark
countess
but
she
seemed
to
be
pretty
that
misled
me
perhaps
i
was
foolish
to
imagine
for
a
moment
that
it
could
have
been
you
ellerey
knew
that
such
an
explanation
would
not
content
her
would
it
satisfy
any
woman
he
had
only
to
wait
and
she
would
ply
him
with
further
questions
and
if
she
were
not
the
woman
would
not
rest
until
she
had
discovered
who
the
other
woman
was
she
would
probably
help
him
to
some
explanation
of
his
adventure
in
the
long
run
her
curiosity
leading
her
to
play
the
part
of
a
useful
ally
the
days
passed
and
no
message
came
from
the
queen
neither
did
he
see
nor
hear
anything
of
de
froilette
the
frenchman
was
not
at
court
and
ellerey
did
not
meet
him
in
the
streets
of
sturatzberg
he
did
not
go
to
visit
him
in
the
altstrasse
it
had
been
agreed
that
he
should
not
do
so
after
consideration
ellerey
had
taken
stefan
into
his
confidence
he
believed
the
rough
soldier
had
some
affection
for
him
so
had
told
him
something
of
his
adventure
in
the
altstrasse
and
of
the
mysterious
mission
he
might
be
called
upon
at
any
moment
to
perform
such
men
as
ellerey
wished
to
enlist
in
the
enterprise
were
not
easy
to
find
there
were
plenty
of
adventurous
spirits
ready
for
any
service
so
they
were
well
paid
but
such
men
were
quite
likely
to
desert
him
at
the
critical
moment
if
they
saw
any
benefit
to
themselves
in
doing
so
now
stefan
can
we
find
the
men
we
want
ellerey
asked
a
dozen
of
them
queried
the
soldier
thoughtfully
twelve
trusty
comrades
it
a
large
order
in
a
world
where
it
safest
to
trust
nobody
there
is
adventure
there
is
good
pay
two
attractions
to
the
soldier
of
fortune
yes
captain
but
the
soldier
of
fortune
in
sturatzberg
is
a
scurvy
sort
of
rascal
he
not
over
fond
of
his
trade
when
there
any
danger
in
it
but
i
sound
one
or
two
i
know
of
and
you
can
see
what
you
think
of
them
and
mark
this
captain
do
pay
them
too
much
until
they
earned
it
a
few
coins
to
oil
their
courage
is
enough
to
begin
with
the
choosing
of
the
men
became
stefan
work
but
only
half
a
dozen
had
been
determined
on
when
ellerey
received
an
unexpected
letter
from
sir
charles
martin
it
was
a
pleasant
letter
of
friendship
such
a
letter
as
brings
forcibly
to
the
senses
of
the
mind
the
sunlight
and
shadow
dappling
an
english
lane
and
the
familiar
sounds
and
refreshing
fragrances
which
linger
about
an
english
home
toward
the
end
sir
charles
turned
to
a
painful
subject
but
wrote
hopefully
let
me
urge
you
he
said
to
return
home
i
am
convinced
that
the
time
has
come
for
you
to
begin
to
slowly
prove
that
you
are
innocent
while
the
affair
was
fresh
in
minds
you
were
at
a
disadvantage
but
that
time
is
past
one
thing
i
may
tell
you
a
person
very
highly
placed
has
expressed
his
complete
belief
in
you
come
home
desmond
ellerey
was
musing
over
this
letter
and
the
remembrance
it
brought
with
it
when
stefan
entered
a
gentleman
to
see
you
captain
ellerey
rose
hastily
the
one
or
two
brother
officers
who
visited
him
stood
on
no
such
ceremony
as
this
he
bowed
in
silence
as
lord
cloverton
came
in
neither
of
them
spoke
until
stefan
had
closed
the
door
you
will
pardon
the
intrusion
captain
ellerey
i
am
honored
my
lord
said
ellerey
as
he
placed
a
chair
for
his
visitor
i
am
still
interested
in
you
you
see
said
the
ambassador
but
have
not
considered
it
wise
to
draw
attention
to
ourselves
at
court
a
man
in
my
position
labors
under
a
disadvantage
of
never
being
supposed
to
speak
a
word
that
has
not
weighty
matter
behind
it
some
people
will
find
a
mystery
in
my
simple
utterance
of
you
and
i
are
both
englishmen
and
to
be
seen
often
in
intimate
conversation
would
start
a
small
army
of
rumors
on
the
march
ellerey
bowed
he
intended
to
let
the
ambassador
lead
the
conversation
do
you
mind
looking
at
me
captain
ellerey
ellerey
did
so
and
for
the
space
of
thirty
seconds
the
two
men
gazed
into
each
other
eyes
no
i
do
not
believe
it
to
what
do
you
refer
ellerey
asked
to
that
card
scandal
of
yours
i
believe
you
are
an
innocent
man
why
do
you
prove
it
ellerey
took
up
the
letter
which
he
had
thrown
on
the
table
when
lord
cloverton
entered
do
you
know
sir
charles
martin
he
asked
holding
the
letter
out
to
him
i
have
heard
of
him
who
that
is
interested
in
english
politics
has
not
i
may
live
to
see
him
prime
minister
what
do
you
wish
me
to
read
this
if
you
please
lord
cloverton
read
the
letter
through
evidently
an
intimate
friend
of
yours
you
could
not
have
a
better
sponsor
for
your
character
i
think
he
gives
you
excellent
advice
you
would
give
me
the
same
lord
cloverton
certainly
why
because
you
are
an
innocent
man
it
is
your
duty
to
fight
for
your
character
to
the
last
ditch
why
should
you
suppose
i
am
not
fighting
for
my
character
ellerey
asked
here
in
sturatzberg
why
not
words
will
never
mend
a
broken
reputation
deeds
may
deeds
done
here
will
not
count
in
england
and
in
england
or
for
england
i
am
debarred
from
doing
anything
a
sorry
position
is
it
not
my
lord
i
am
advising
you
to
alter
it
but
you
have
not
told
me
why
said
ellerey
shall
i
tell
you
the
reason
lord
cloverton
you
wish
me
to
leave
sturatzberg
why
should
i
that
you
must
tell
me
there
is
a
candor
about
you
captain
ellerey
that
compels
straightforward
treatment
in
return
and
you
shall
have
it
i
have
a
misgiving
that
your
presence
here
will
tend
to
hamper
my
work
and
by
my
work
i
mean
england
interests
i
do
not
pretend
to
know
exactly
in
what
direction
you
will
hinder
me
but
i
can
guess
and
you
are
too
good
a
man
to
be
crushed
while
striving
against
your
own
country
go
back
to
england
i
thoroughly
believe
in
you
and
you
shall
have
my
hearty
support
in
your
endeavor
to
establish
your
innocency
you
are
very
good
my
lord
and
i
thank
you
but
i
regret
that
i
can
not
comply
with
your
wishes
i
shall
not
leave
sturatzberg
you
prefer
to
be
crushed
yes
in
the
service
of
my
adopted
country
we
fight
with
different
weapons
lord
cloverton
then
it
is
to
be
war
between
us
you
seem
to
say
so
i
can
not
leave
sturatzberg
is
it
not
possible
that
some
sense
of
honor
may
exist
here
that
officers
here
may
not
care
to
associate
with
one
who
has
been
convicted
of
cheating
even
though
he
be
a
foreigner
i
am
not
afraid
that
lord
cloverton
will
spread
such
a
report
of
me
my
country
stands
first
with
me
captain
ellerey
but
not
to
make
you
dishonorable
you
are
attempting
to
do
yourself
an
injustice
besides
if
i
were
driven
to
use
such
weapons
in
is
it
not
possible
that
lord
cloverton
has
some
enemies
in
sturatzberg
many
no
doubt
i
might
suggest
for
instance
that
he
had
secretly
sought
to
alienate
the
loyalty
of
one
of
his
majesty
officers
enough
captain
ellerey
said
lord
cloverton
rising
i
see
that
we
must
unfortunately
be
enemies
it
is
a
pity
you
will
be
crushed
under
the
juggernaut
of
international
politics
it
may
be
so
it
may
not
said
ellerey
believe
me
i
am
not
unmindful
of
your
kindness
but
as
i
have
said
we
fight
with
different
weapons
you
wield
the
power
of
the
politician
i
have
only
my
sword
we
can
not
therefore
meet
in
encounter
i
should
hesitate
to
use
my
sword
against
my
countrymen
but
until
british
soldiers
hold
the
heights
above
sturatzberg
there
is
no
need
to
consider
that
question
and
your
work
i
presume
lies
in
preventing
any
chance
of
such
a
contingency
if
you
could
forget
that
i
am
an
englishman
and
remember
only
that
i
am
a
captain
of
horse
subject
to
the
commands
of
my
superior
officer
you
would
understand
my
position
better
you
are
a
difficult
man
to
deal
with
but
i
rather
like
you
said
the
ambassador
holding
out
his
hand
i
regret
that
fate
makes
us
enemies
and
if
at
the
last
moment
i
can
save
you
from
being
entirely
crushed
i
will
thank
you
i
too
may
find
an
opportunity
of
rendering
you
a
service
my
lord
as
lord
cloverton
went
quickly
away
a
man
who
had
been
sitting
at
a
small
table
in
a
cafe
opposite
who
had
sipped
two
glasses
of
absinthe
and
smoked
innumerable
cigarettes
rose
hastily
and
crossed
the
street
his
dress
was
and
he
had
evidently
ridden
through
dirty
weather
for
his
boots
were
thickly
cased
with
mud
ellerey
was
almost
as
surprised
to
see
de
froilette
as
he
had
been
to
see
the
ambassador
you
have
been
away
from
sturatzberg
he
said
i
have
only
just
returned
de
froilette
answered
throwing
out
his
arms
to
draw
attention
to
his
clothes
and
before
going
to
the
altstrasse
came
to
prepare
you
i
have
been
waiting
at
the
cafe
opposite
until
lord
cloverton
came
out
and
wondering
why
he
visited
me
asked
ellerey
smiling
wondering
rather
how
far
you
would
be
successful
in
deceiving
him
he
was
disposed
to
be
friendly
said
ellerey
carelessly
taking
up
sir
charles
martin
letter
from
the
table
and
putting
it
in
his
pocket
friendly
a
trick
of
his
monsieur
a
trick
exactly
we
have
agreed
to
be
enemies
ah
but
that
was
foolish
said
de
froilette
quickly
you
should
have
played
with
him
even
as
i
do
he
believes
that
i
am
very
friendly
while
i
hate
him
that
is
your
method
it
is
not
mine
i
am
not
an
adept
at
crawling
even
to
the
british
ambassador
what
does
he
suspect
asked
de
froilette
after
a
pause
during
which
he
had
seemed
inclined
to
resent
ellerey
words
naturally
he
did
not
say
and
i
am
unable
to
guess
which
is
hardly
remarkable
seeing
that
i
am
entirely
in
the
dark
myself
but
why
did
he
come
he
used
his
knowledge
of
some
friends
of
mine
in
england
as
an
excuse
for
visiting
me
but
he
had
probably
taken
upon
himself
for
the
time
being
the
office
of
spy
as
i
had
no
information
to
give
he
has
returned
little
wiser
than
he
came
when
am
i
to
be
fully
trusted
monsieur
you
are
fully
trusted
now
captain
ellerey
but
the
time
for
striking
has
not
arrived
it
approaches
however
until
the
man
in
sturatzberg
was
ready
we
could
not
proceed
look
at
me
i
have
come
from
a
journey
i
have
been
doing
my
part
and
i
come
to
you
and
say
be
ready
at
any
moment
her
majesty
may
send
for
you
i
am
waiting
said
ellerey
not
perhaps
nor
but
soon
knowing
the
frenchman
secretive
method
ellerey
was
convinced
that
the
time
was
at
hand
were
it
not
de
froilette
would
hardly
have
risked
seeking
him
at
his
lodging
he
had
been
so
careful
to
avoid
all
appearance
of
intimacy
with
him
ellerey
was
not
inclined
to
place
implicit
trust
in
de
froilette
he
did
not
pretend
to
a
keen
insight
into
other
men
characters
but
he
conceived
that
de
froilette
would
not
be
likely
to
lose
sight
of
his
own
interests
no
matter
whom
he
served
nor
how
humbly
such
service
might
be
tendered
ellerey
was
not
even
convinced
that
the
frenchman
support
of
the
queen
schemes
was
and
believed
him
quite
capable
of
giving
just
so
much
help
as
would
presently
enable
him
to
thwart
her
and
reap
benefit
for
himself
whatever
the
mission
was
which
he
was
about
to
undertake
ellerey
intended
to
do
his
utmost
to
carry
it
to
success
and
if
de
froilette
by
chance
stood
in
his
way
it
was
not
likely
to
be
merely
a
question
of
words
between
them
more
subtle
more
given
to
abstract
reasoning
a
successful
student
of
character
it
must
be
said
for
monsieur
de
froilette
that
he
fully
trusted
captain
ellerey
in
so
far
that
he
believed
he
would
do
whatever
task
was
set
him
better
probably
than
most
men
would
that
he
would
be
a
match
for
such
men
as
lord
cloverton
with
the
weapons
lord
cloverton
would
use
he
did
not
expect
and
that
the
ambassador
had
visited
ellerey
troubled
him
not
a
little
that
lord
cloverton
could
possibly
suspect
the
true
state
of
things
he
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
but
every
hour
delay
now
would
be
in
the
ambassador
favor
and
the
sooner
the
blow
was
struck
the
better
the
more
hope
of
success
was
there
everything
was
ready
and
it
was
now
that
de
anxiety
was
greatest
he
was
too
complete
a
schemer
not
to
realize
how
often
it
was
the
small
insignificant
thing
which
served
to
ruin
great
enterprises
built
up
with
so
much
care
and
elaboration
over
and
over
again
he
had
tested
every
point
in
his
plans
and
had
not
succeeded
in
finding
any
weak
spot
there
seemed
to
be
no
contingency
he
was
not
prepared
to
meet
for
which
he
was
not
ready
and
yet
a
sense
of
misgiving
almost
amounting
to
a
feeling
of
insecurity
oppressed
him
as
he
walked
along
the
altstrasse
the
people
hanging
about
the
door
saluted
him
for
the
frenchman
had
been
liberal
to
his
poor
neighbors
and
had
an
excellent
name
for
charity
he
had
made
many
friends
of
this
kind
in
sturatzberg
and
since
he
had
confessed
to
disliking
unprofitable
friends
it
must
be
assumed
that
he
looked
to
reap
some
reward
from
them
in
the
future
he
was
not
the
man
to
pay
merely
for
respect
and
smiles
he
went
to
his
room
the
room
in
which
he
and
ellerey
had
sat
talking
after
dinner
the
room
to
which
the
queen
had
come
a
pile
of
unopened
letters
was
upon
the
desk
for
monsieur
de
froilette
employed
no
secretary
and
he
turned
over
these
letters
without
opening
them
before
ringing
for
francois
well
francois
he
said
as
the
man
entered
he
always
asked
the
question
in
the
same
manner
when
he
had
been
absent
for
any
time
and
listened
to
the
servant
answer
without
interrupting
him
the
answer
was
usually
a
long
one
full
details
of
the
happenings
during
the
master
absence
not
of
those
in
the
house
only
but
of
those
in
the
city
as
well
however
there
was
no
long
answer
francois
seemed
fully
aware
of
the
essential
point
monsieur
the
princess
she
has
left
england
my
good
francois
you
are
uninteresting
that
happened
weeks
ago
the
princess
is
cruising
to
the
british
colonies
it
is
known
indeed
was
arranged
by
the
british
government
it
was
monsieur
that
is
right
it
was
but
the
princess
found
a
substitute
for
that
voyage
she
did
not
go
she
slipped
away
quietly
and
no
one
knew
de
froilette
face
was
suddenly
pale
he
did
not
speak
but
francois
read
the
question
in
his
eyes
it
is
so
monsieur
he
said
the
princess
maritza
is
in
sturatzberg
chapter
vi
frina
mavrodin
guest
for
some
time
monsieur
de
froilette
remained
silent
the
return
of
the
princess
was
a
contingency
he
had
not
provided
for
where
is
she
he
asked
suddenly
alas
monsieur
i
do
not
know
francois
answered
she
has
powerful
friends
in
sturatzberg
and
they
conceal
her
well
i
saw
her
for
one
moment
in
konigsplatz
she
was
alone
and
entered
a
shop
there
i
followed
her
but
she
was
gone
i
called
myself
her
servant
and
inquired
about
her
making
the
sign
that
has
so
long
been
used
by
her
partisans
to
secure
an
answer
it
had
no
effect
i
was
told
that
i
was
mistaken
that
no
such
lady
as
i
had
described
had
entered
do
you
not
understand
monsieur
the
sign
must
have
been
changed
de
froilette
understood
only
too
well
at
his
very
door
were
enemies
the
more
dangerous
because
they
had
been
partially
admitted
into
his
plans
he
had
himself
given
them
reason
for
watching
him
and
the
opportunity
of
doing
so
that
was
past
and
beyond
reparation
but
this
arch
schemer
was
not
the
man
to
stand
idly
regretting
a
mistake
even
mistakes
might
be
used
to
advantage
i
will
dress
francois
he
said
presently
i
had
not
intended
to
go
to
court
but
this
news
compels
me
and
how
shall
we
find
the
princess
monsieur
we
will
not
trouble
we
will
set
others
to
do
that
matters
will
be
for
our
benefit
in
the
end
francois
quickly
i
must
dress
de
froilette
dined
alone
and
dismissed
the
man
who
waited
upon
him
as
soon
as
possible
a
portrait
of
queen
elena
stood
on
a
side
table
and
he
got
up
and
placed
it
beside
him
contemplating
it
thoughtfully
as
he
sipped
his
wine
if
we
succeed
he
mused
there
is
high
place
and
distinction
to
be
won
this
englishman
may
win
it
for
me
in
a
revolution
a
king
life
is
as
other
men
dependent
on
the
hazard
of
a
die
if
i
read
her
smile
aright
i
shall
have
my
reward
and
if
we
fail
he
paused
to
consider
the
course
of
events
in
such
a
case
who
knows
my
reward
might
come
the
easier
there
would
be
few
shelters
open
to
her
only
in
defeat
through
princess
maritza
influence
is
there
danger
to
me
success
or
failure
otherwise
what
does
it
matter
i
shall
win
the
paths
to
mountain
peaks
are
ever
rugged
but
men
reach
the
summits
why
should
i
fail
the
road
to
power
may
be
closed
against
me
but
the
road
to
love
and
he
gazed
into
the
eyes
of
the
portrait
finding
an
answer
in
them
this
man
of
action
was
a
dreamer
too
when
he
entered
the
palace
that
evening
de
froilette
inquired
whether
lord
cloverton
had
arrived
and
being
answered
in
the
negative
remained
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
speaking
a
few
words
to
this
acquaintance
and
to
that
bowing
a
compliment
to
one
fair
lady
or
meeting
another
pleasantry
with
an
answering
jest
he
was
in
excellent
good
humor
presently
lord
cloverton
came
mincing
up
the
steps
pausing
half
a
dozen
times
to
greet
acquaintances
he
too
was
in
excellent
humor
but
then
he
seldom
allowed
people
to
see
him
otherwise
how
i
hate
the
man
de
froilette
said
to
himself
going
toward
the
ambassador
as
he
reached
the
vestibule
may
i
have
a
word
with
you
my
lord
a
thousand
my
dear
monsieur
de
froilette
ah
a
private
word
is
it
he
added
as
the
frenchman
led
him
aside
my
lord
you
have
my
greatest
esteem
as
you
are
aware
lord
cloverton
bowed
if
as
a
loyal
frenchman
i
would
see
france
predominant
in
the
affairs
of
this
country
that
is
natural
is
it
not
so
most
natural
indeed
and
monsieur
i
say
frankly
france
is
playing
a
very
worthy
part
no
doubt
my
lord
de
froilette
answered
i
am
but
a
with
certain
business
interests
which
politics
might
affect
and
therefore
i
take
some
notice
of
politics
perhaps
i
see
more
clearly
than
some
my
lord
the
often
do
and
i
am
convinced
that
british
policy
is
at
the
present
moment
the
safeguard
of
wallaria
i
rejoice
to
hear
it
monsieur
and
if
you
will
allow
me
my
lord
i
will
add
that
your
presence
in
sturatzberg
is
the
great
security
you
flatter
me
lord
cloverton
returned
you
will
be
pleased
to
learn
that
i
have
received
no
notification
that
i
am
likely
to
be
removed
from
sturatzberg
that
would
indeed
be
a
disaster
said
de
froilette
so
my
lord
any
small
help
any
little
information
i
can
give
you
i
shall
give
gladly
regard
for
yourself
and
my
business
interests
will
prompt
me
we
have
all
a
vein
of
selfishness
in
us
i
am
honored
by
your
confidence
and
you
will
be
welcome
at
the
embassy
i
will
give
you
the
information
now
said
de
froilette
and
he
lowered
his
voice
as
he
leaned
toward
the
ambassador
the
princess
maritza
is
in
australia
at
present
i
believe
exactly
said
the
frenchman
making
a
tour
of
the
english
colonies
a
delicate
attention
to
an
honored
guest
and
unfortunate
exile
designed
to
keep
her
out
of
the
way
while
the
present
unsettled
feeling
in
wallaria
lasts
is
it
not
so
your
political
acumen
is
not
at
fault
no
my
lord
but
yours
is
the
lady
at
present
in
australia
or
wherever
she
may
be
is
not
the
princess
but
a
substitute
it
needs
very
powerful
friends
to
carry
through
such
a
deception
as
that
lord
cloverton
turned
sharply
toward
him
and
as
francois
had
done
de
froilette
answered
the
unasked
question
yes
my
lord
princess
maritza
is
in
sturatzberg
hiding
where
that
i
do
not
know
you
will
doubtless
take
means
to
find
out
command
me
if
i
can
help
you
in
any
way
i
thank
you
for
the
information
if
you
are
not
mistaken
the
wayward
child
has
been
very
ill
advised
i
gather
monsieur
that
your
business
affairs
would
suffer
were
such
a
thing
as
a
rising
in
the
princess
maritza
favor
to
take
place
have
i
not
said
that
there
is
a
selfish
vein
in
all
of
us
lord
cloverton
smiled
and
together
they
crossed
the
vestibule
their
short
colloquy
had
not
been
overheard
nor
had
their
presence
been
particularly
noticed
there
except
by
one
person
the
countess
mavrodin
she
had
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
as
de
froilette
had
leaned
confidentially
forward
toward
the
ambassador
and
she
hastily
greeted
a
friend
keeping
her
standing
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
while
they
talked
she
had
good
reason
to
be
curious
regarding
such
a
confidence
between
two
such
men
and
while
she
laughed
and
talked
she
watched
them
she
did
not
move
until
they
had
crossed
the
vestibule
and
when
they
separated
she
followed
lord
cloverton
desmond
ellerey
met
her
and
found
her
in
a
gracious
mood
have
i
quite
pardoned
you
for
mistaking
me
for
another
woman
that
night
in
the
altstrasse
she
said
gayly
i
hope
so
indeed
i
thought
so
i
am
sorry
i
ought
to
have
reserved
some
of
my
displeasure
why
so
that
i
might
demand
a
favor
you
have
but
to
demand
countess
then
stay
with
me
and
keep
me
near
lord
cloverton
she
said
what
has
he
incurred
your
displeasure
too
must
i
give
reasons
for
my
demand
no
then
you
trust
me
as
i
would
trust
any
woman
for
a
moment
she
seemed
satisfied
and
then
she
turned
toward
him
is
there
a
meaning
underneath
that
do
you
trust
no
woman
i
have
learnt
my
lessons
in
a
hard
school
countess
i
trust
few
either
men
or
women
and
i
have
more
knowledge
of
men
than
women
they
followed
lord
cloverton
across
the
rooms
and
she
noticed
every
one
to
whom
he
spoke
presently
he
stood
to
watch
the
dancing
for
a
moment
but
he
seemed
to
avoid
any
person
who
might
detain
him
in
conversation
for
any
length
of
time
i
think
the
ambassador
will
leave
early
the
countess
said
may
i
beg
another
favor
captain
ellerey
will
you
see
that
my
carriage
is
ready
waiting
for
me
ellerey
went
to
do
her
bidding
wondering
why
she
was
watching
the
ambassador
so
keenly
it
took
him
some
time
to
find
her
servants
and
as
he
returned
he
met
lord
cloverton
with
the
slightest
of
recognitions
the
ambassador
got
into
his
carriage
the
embassy
quickly
he
said
countess
mavrodin
came
down
the
stairs
as
lord
cloverton
drove
away
i
thank
you
she
said
i
have
a
habit
of
remembering
favors
i
shall
remember
that
you
have
said
so
ellerey
answered
indeed
i
can
even
now
ask
one
only
this
afternoon
lord
cloverton
was
pleased
to
tell
me
that
he
looked
upon
me
as
an
enemy
should
you
discover
anything
which
might
affect
me
will
you
tell
me
he
said
you
were
an
enemy
then
i
am
not
suspicious
in
vain
yes
i
will
tell
you
if
i
can
one
word
monsieur
you
neither
trust
women
nor
men
so
perchance
the
warning
is
unnecessary
but
of
all
men
at
least
distrust
one
jules
de
froilette
did
her
majesty
bid
you
give
me
that
message
ellerey
asked
no
monsieur
it
is
an
original
idea
i
have
ideas
of
my
own
sometimes
i
have
one
now
if
you
are
leaving
the
palace
i
will
drive
you
to
the
western
gate
she
was
pretty
and
ellerey
was
only
human
strictly
speaking
his
duty
was
to
remain
lest
the
queen
should
send
for
him
but
he
helped
the
countess
into
her
carriage
and
seated
himself
beside
her
she
refused
to
be
serious
as
they
drove
through
the
city
and
when
ellerey
entered
his
lodging
he
was
left
to
wonder
at
what
point
the
incidents
of
the
evening
touched
his
mission
why
should
the
countess
become
suddenly
interested
in
the
movements
of
lord
cloverton
and
since
she
was
closely
attached
to
the
queen
why
should
she
warn
him
against
de
froilette
who
was
also
deep
in
her
majesty
confidence
the
problem
was
beyond
his
power
to
solve
frina
mavrodin
was
a
far
more
important
person
in
sturatzberg
than
ellerey
imagined
it
was
not
only
at
court
that
she
was
popular
she
was
besides
the
lady
bountiful
to
the
poor
she
was
immensely
wealthy
and
her
beautiful
home
by
the
river
in
the
southwest
of
the
city
had
been
called
the
beggars
paradise
for
those
who
asked
charity
were
seldom
sent
away
empty
the
general
criticism
of
her
was
that
she
was
a
pretty
woman
very
adorable
a
little
frivolous
perhaps
and
possessed
of
much
more
heart
than
head
she
seemed
to
take
delight
in
such
criticism
and
to
be
at
some
pains
to
fully
merit
it
but
there
was
another
side
to
her
character
which
few
persons
ever
got
even
a
glimpse
of
her
profound
knowledge
of
current
politics
would
have
startled
lord
cloverton
and
her
capacity
for
intrigue
and
scheming
would
have
astonished
even
monsieur
de
froilette
into
admiration
there
were
few
clubs
and
societies
in
sturatzberg
where
discontent
was
fostered
and
secret
plans
discussed
which
were
not
known
to
frina
mavrodin
she
was
conversant
with
their
secret
signs
their
aims
and
their
means
and
knew
by
sight
most
of
their
influential
members
a
single
word
from
her
would
have
sent
many
a
man
to
prison
who
walked
the
streets
freely
perhaps
in
all
sturatzberg
there
was
only
one
person
who
gave
her
credit
for
such
knowledge
and
who
was
content
to
be
guided
in
some
measure
by
her
advice
this
person
at
present
occupied
a
suite
of
rooms
in
frina
house
and
this
evening
she
reclined
at
full
length
among
the
cushions
of
a
low
couch
and
watched
a
door
at
one
end
of
the
room
expectantly
her
hand
was
stretched
out
to
a
bowl
of
flowers
on
a
table
by
her
side
and
she
plucked
a
petal
at
intervals
which
she
crushed
and
let
fall
something
of
the
girl
character
seemed
to
be
in
the
action
she
was
not
weary
not
worn
out
with
the
day
work
or
pleasure
whichever
it
might
have
been
but
was
waiting
anxiously
irritably
even
for
news
or
for
someone
coming
her
hair
had
loosened
by
contact
with
the
cushions
and
fell
about
her
shoulders
in
luxuriant
tresses
presently
the
door
opened
and
an
elderly
woman
entered
an
english
woman
plain
in
feature
and
resolute
in
manner
you
have
been
spoiling
your
flowers
she
said
seeing
the
scattered
petals
on
the
carpet
never
mind
them
has
dumitru
come
hannah
just
come
then
bring
him
in
bring
him
in
why
do
you
wait
exclaimed
the
girl
from
her
reclining
position
i
can
not
afford
to
have
fools
about
me
in
such
times
as
these
you
have
the
woman
answered
bluntly
evidently
quite
used
to
the
petulant
moods
of
her
mistress
i
was
one
when
i
came
out
of
devon
to
a
heathen
place
like
this
but
that
time
is
past
and
she
went
to
the
door
and
beckoned
to
a
man
to
come
in
as
he
entered
she
went
out
closing
the
door
behind
her
when
she
had
gone
the
man
dropped
swiftly
on
one
knee
by
the
couch
well
dumitru
he
returned
said
the
man
rising
and
standing
erect
he
went
straight
to
the
lodging
of
this
english
captain
and
then
to
court
princess
and
his
mission
dumitru
was
it
in
my
interests
think
you
the
man
made
a
fierce
clicking
sound
with
his
tongue
ah
no
no
no
and
again
a
hundred
times
no
he
is
for
the
queen
a
little
and
for
himself
very
much
have
you
still
a
doubt
even
now
a
sudden
death
should
be
his
reward
patience
dumitru
the
english
captain
had
another
visitor
the
british
minister
this
english
captain
is
in
great
requisition
it
would
seem
she
said
aye
he
is
a
man
i
grant
you
that
strong
resolute
and
rides
as
though
horse
and
rider
were
one
piece
and
honest
dumitru
i
have
looked
into
his
face
and
thought
him
so
can
one
judge
so
easily
asked
the
man
besides
honest
or
not
he
is
for
our
enemies
our
enemies
must
be
swept
aside
she
said
imperiously
as
though
not
only
the
will
but
the
power
to
do
so
were
hers
thus
princess
and
the
man
dark
eyes
gleamed
as
he
just
showed
the
keen
thin
blade
of
a
dagger
which
he
carried
in
his
cloak
not
without
my
command
dumitru
she
said
hastily
the
man
bowed
low
disappointed
perhaps
that
the
same
spirit
was
not
in
her
as
was
in
him
we
may
use
this
english
captain
for
our
ends
she
went
on
i
have
a
way
and
you
shall
help
me
dumitru
when
the
time
comes
that
lord
cloverton
has
visited
him
shows
that
some
new
pressure
is
to
be
brought
to
bear
upon
him
we
shall
see
how
he
stands
in
this
whether
firm
or
not
and
may
learn
how
to
act
ourselves
he
is
ready
to
act
when
the
token
is
given
him
said
dumitru
he
has
a
few
desperate
men
who
are
pledged
to
his
service
you
are
sure
of
this
quite
sure
who
will
follow
for
love
of
him
she
asked
they
are
of
the
kind
who
follow
more
readily
for
money
answered
the
man
the
girl
remained
thoughtful
for
a
few
moments
something
in
the
information
had
set
her
thoughts
running
in
a
new
channel
and
while
she
mused
frina
mavrodin
entered
the
room
hurriedly
dumitru
bowed
low
before
her
you
are
early
said
the
princess
frina
turned
to
dumitru
captain
ellerey
has
returned
early
to
his
lodging
too
it
would
be
well
to
watch
i
do
not
think
it
will
happen
but
should
any
messenger
seek
him
we
must
know
at
once
go
dumitru
said
the
princess
and
when
he
had
gone
she
turned
to
her
companion
what
has
brought
you
home
so
early
you
maritza
i
wondered
whether
you
had
remained
safely
here
or
whether
you
had
again
jeopardized
your
cause
by
going
so
openly
into
the
streets
it
is
known
that
you
are
in
sturatzberg
by
whom
that
servant
of
de
froilette
saw
you
as
you
know
you
thought
he
would
believe
himself
mistaken
but
i
knew
better
his
master
returned
and
i
found
monsieur
de
froilette
and
lord
cloverton
in
confidential
conversation
when
two
men
who
hate
each
other
as
they
do
agree
it
is
time
to
prepare
for
the
storm
you
must
remain
an
absolute
prisoner
here
for
a
while
i
am
tired
of
inactivity
you
will
not
have
to
wait
long
frina
answered
within
an
hour
i
warrant
you
there
will
be
spies
out
in
every
quarter
of
the
city
to
try
and
find
your
you
are
safe
so
long
as
you
remain
here
what
an
advantage
it
is
to
have
such
a
reputation
for
as
i
have
no
doubt
de
froilette
played
a
trump
card
in
telling
lord
cloverton
of
your
presence
in
sturatzberg
the
task
of
finding
you
will
occupy
the
minister
attention
for
a
little
while
and
if
de
froilette
is
ready
he
will
seize
the
opportunity
to
strike
his
blow
that
is
why
i
offered
to
drive
captain
ellerey
to
his
lodging
if
the
token
is
to
be
given
he
will
not
be
there
to
receive
it
it
may
be
sent
to
him
said
the
princess
that
is
why
dumitru
watches
by
the
western
gate
the
moment
the
token
is
given
i
must
know
said
maritza
i
have
a
plan
i
have
had
plenty
of
lonely
hours
in
which
to
mature
plans
i
am
longing
to
put
them
into
action
we
are
too
cautious
frina
your
want
of
caution
in
going
openly
into
the
city
has
nearly
ruined
us
maritza
i
have
many
friends
in
the
city
true
and
many
enemies
and
it
is
the
enemies
who
happen
to
be
in
power
do
not
be
impatient
may
be
as
fatal
as
impatience
maritza
answered
we
should
advance
a
step
each
day
each
night
do
we
advance
so
fast
that
we
shall
have
to
run
quickly
to
keep
abreast
of
affairs
shortly
a
few
weeks
ago
had
you
any
real
hope
of
being
in
sturatzberg
yet
you
are
here
had
you
even
a
suspicion
that
jules
de
froilette
had
been
working
in
his
own
interests
for
these
two
years
past
and
not
in
yours
true
frina
we
have
advanced
heaven
help
de
froilette
when
i
touch
power
who
knows
what
injury
he
may
not
have
done
to
my
cause
in
these
two
years
and
he
has
succeeded
in
drawing
this
english
captain
into
his
schemes
captain
ellerey
does
not
like
de
froilette
said
frina
tell
me
your
plan
maritza
the
princess
drew
a
flower
carefully
from
the
bowl
and
held
it
to
her
face
as
though
she
were
absorbed
for
a
moment
in
its
beauty
and
fragrance
captain
ellerey
left
the
court
with
you
she
said
that
was
wisely
thought
of
did
he
come
willingly
frina
laughed
such
a
joy
in
the
laugh
that
the
princess
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
yes
he
came
willingly
most
willingly
i
think
you
hope
to
win
him
to
my
cause
he
is
a
man
i
am
a
woman
i
shall
try
and
then
then
maritza
ah
we
run
on
too
fast
tell
me
your
plan
it
is
strange
said
the
princess
slowly
but
in
england
as
i
told
you
i
once
met
captain
ellerey
i
told
him
who
i
was
and
promised
him
work
for
his
sword
should
he
ever
come
to
wallaria
you
told
him
that
why
i
am
a
woman
and
he
is
a
man
the
princess
answered
for
a
moment
the
two
women
looked
into
each
other
eyes
then
frina
looked
down
and
straightened
a
fold
of
her
dress
while
maritza
bent
to
inhale
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
in
the
vase
the
princess
did
not
tell
her
plan
and
frina
mavrodin
forgot
to
question
her
chapter
vii
the
time
arrives
within
a
short
time
of
lord
cloverton
return
to
the
embassy
spies
and
agents
were
abroad
in
the
city
endeavoring
to
discover
the
whereabouts
of
princess
maritza
the
ambassador
at
once
telegraphed
to
the
foreign
office
in
london
and
received
the
answer
that
the
report
of
her
return
to
wallaria
was
absurd
that
she
was
certainly
on
her
way
to
australia
this
confident
answer
however
did
not
satisfy
lord
cloverton
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
no
news
of
the
princess
was
forth
coming
that
she
could
have
returned
to
sturatzberg
without
his
knowledge
more
without
the
knowledge
of
any
of
those
who
were
so
eager
to
keep
her
out
of
the
country
seemed
impossible
but
then
in
diplomacy
it
was
often
the
impossible
things
which
happened
he
was
too
astute
a
man
to
underrate
the
undoubted
ability
of
de
froilette
there
were
few
men
who
probed
more
accurately
the
likely
trend
of
future
events
or
who
were
quicker
to
recognize
opportunities
and
seize
them
than
the
frenchman
and
lord
cloverton
argued
that
he
was
far
too
clever
a
man
to
tell
such
an
unlikely
story
merely
to
serve
his
own
ends
he
would
know
that
the
very
improbability
of
the
tale
would
have
the
effect
of
drawing
attention
to
himself
and
his
actions
no
whether
the
report
were
true
or
not
de
froilette
believed
it
and
evidently
saw
danger
to
himself
in
the
presence
of
princess
maritza
at
the
same
time
he
might
perceive
a
favorable
opportunity
in
the
state
of
affairs
to
exploit
his
own
plans
and
lord
cloverton
took
the
precaution
to
have
the
frenchman
under
careful
observation
the
unexpected
information
had
also
caused
the
ambassador
to
reconsider
captain
ellerey
position
in
sturatzberg
it
was
quite
possible
that
he
knew
more
about
the
princess
than
any
one
else
he
was
the
kind
of
man
who
would
have
nerve
and
determination
enough
to
attempt
a
desperate
venture
and
having
little
to
lose
and
all
to
win
might
go
far
toward
success
he
and
de
froilette
apparently
held
little
communication
with
each
other
the
characteristics
of
the
two
men
were
antagonistic
and
the
englishman
might
be
quite
as
capable
of
playing
a
deep
game
as
the
frenchman
was
it
was
a
sleepless
night
for
the
ambassador
this
was
just
such
a
complication
as
might
embroil
the
nations
of
europe
in
strife
an
excuse
which
might
serve
to
snap
diplomatic
relations
and
spread
the
lurid
clouds
of
war
from
the
ural
range
to
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
one
thing
seemed
certain
de
froilette
had
not
repeated
his
information
broadcast
no
intimation
reached
lord
cloverton
that
the
report
had
even
been
whispered
in
any
of
the
other
embassies
and
there
was
some
consolation
in
this
no
news
came
during
the
following
day
wherever
the
princess
was
her
secret
was
well
kept
probably
because
only
a
few
persons
had
been
admitted
into
it
and
it
seemed
evident
that
no
special
movement
had
taken
place
in
her
favor
or
had
even
been
arranged
for
some
bold
might
be
in
contemplation
and
although
the
many
and
diverse
interests
in
the
country
were
probably
sufficient
to
render
any
attempt
abortive
in
itself
yet
such
an
attempt
might
be
the
one
thing
needed
to
fan
the
smouldering
ashes
into
flame
starting
a
conflagration
which
would
burn
throughout
europe
such
fires
never
die
out
they
are
always
smouldering
any
person
who
had
watched
lord
cloverton
closely
when
he
went
to
the
palace
that
night
would
have
been
struck
by
his
particular
alertness
he
was
observant
of
the
composition
of
the
different
groups
in
the
rooms
of
those
who
were
chiefly
about
her
majesty
and
of
those
who
danced
together
the
slightest
confidential
whisper
near
him
attracted
his
attention
and
more
than
once
he
caused
a
blush
to
mount
to
a
pretty
woman
cheeks
by
suddenly
surprising
a
murmured
love
passage
meant
for
no
other
ears
but
her
own
to
those
to
whom
he
spoke
he
succeeded
in
giving
the
impression
that
he
had
only
a
few
moments
to
spare
them
that
he
was
purposely
keeping
himself
free
but
he
managed
to
suggest
that
it
was
not
business
but
some
pleasure
he
anticipated
he
glanced
round
all
the
rooms
in
search
of
captain
ellerey
who
either
had
not
yet
arrived
or
had
already
retired
into
some
quiet
corner
probably
with
the
countess
mavrodin
the
last
conjecture
was
wrong
however
for
standing
in
a
position
which
commanded
the
entrance
to
the
suite
of
state
rooms
the
ambassador
presently
saw
frina
mavrodin
on
the
arm
of
an
of
the
austrian
embassy
an
offshoot
of
a
princely
house
who
rumor
said
had
already
been
twice
refused
by
the
fair
lady
and
was
only
awaiting
an
opportunity
to
adventure
his
case
for
a
third
time
he
was
evidently
persuading
her
to
dance
with
him
and
she
was
laughingly
protesting
perhaps
promising
to
do
so
later
in
the
evening
she
was
however
not
averse
to
his
company
for
she
palpably
kept
him
by
her
side
and
they
remained
talking
and
laughing
together
the
man
extremely
happy
the
woman
watchful
and
rather
preoccupied
the
ambassador
thought
for
half
an
hour
or
more
she
remained
there
evidently
using
the
austrian
presence
to
keep
herself
free
from
other
companions
several
spoke
to
her
but
since
the
did
not
move
away
the
new
arrivals
were
obliged
to
leave
her
after
exchanging
a
few
words
at
last
lord
cloverton
noticed
that
the
expression
of
her
face
suddenly
changed
she
looked
at
him
or
rather
beyond
him
and
turning
to
discover
the
cause
he
saw
desmond
ellerey
crossing
the
room
toward
her
he
also
became
aware
that
baron
petrescu
was
standing
close
to
him
and
that
he
was
watching
ellerey
too
frina
mavrodin
spoke
quickly
to
her
cavalier
telling
him
perhaps
where
he
would
find
her
for
the
promised
dance
but
at
any
rate
she
dismissed
him
for
a
few
moments
ellerey
stood
beside
her
her
smiling
face
raised
to
his
and
then
they
went
slowly
toward
the
the
little
comedy
interests
you
my
lord
well
baron
my
white
hair
gives
me
credit
for
greater
age
than
does
the
feeling
of
youth
which
is
still
in
me
i
am
young
enough
even
now
to
recognize
love
and
to
take
an
interest
in
it
in
others
of
course
baron
petrescu
shrugged
his
shoulders
rather
contemptuously
the
moth
ever
flits
to
the
candle
and
usually
gets
burnt
he
said
would
not
the
lodestone
be
the
more
apposite
simile
asked
lord
cloverton
in
that
case
the
attraction
brings
no
hurt
baron
time
will
show
which
is
the
best
simile
was
the
answer
he
interests
me
this
captain
ellerey
he
interests
the
lady
too
it
seems
replied
the
ambassador
indeed
captain
ellerey
interests
many
people
i
trust
his
courage
is
equal
to
his
ambition
said
the
baron
with
a
smile
there
are
others
striving
for
the
same
prize
my
lord
who
do
not
easily
accept
defeat
and
are
content
to
pin
their
honor
to
the
sword
point
jealous
said
lord
cloverton
to
himself
as
the
baron
turned
away
still
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
but
with
a
movement
of
his
shoulders
which
suggested
an
angry
bird
ruffling
its
feathers
he
means
mischief
ellerey
may
find
his
hands
fuller
than
he
expects
if
the
weapon
is
as
ready
as
his
tongue
sentiment
compels
me
to
wish
my
countryman
victory
but
politically
ah
a
cunning
thrust
which
would
lay
him
aside
for
a
few
weeks
would
be
very
convenient
to
me
and
perhaps
not
the
worst
thing
which
could
happen
for
him
and
lord
cloverton
went
toward
the
the
countess
and
her
cavalier
had
disappeared
are
you
still
watching
the
ambassador
ellerey
had
asked
as
she
placed
her
hand
upon
his
arm
no
then
let
us
get
out
of
the
crowd
few
people
seem
to
know
of
the
alcove
off
the
and
why
such
a
desire
for
solitude
captain
ellerey
she
said
seating
herself
in
a
corner
and
making
room
for
him
beside
her
not
solitude
countess
but
restful
companionship
i
am
not
desirous
of
living
perpetually
under
the
eye
of
lord
cloverton
and
after
what
he
said
i
imagine
he
watches
me
pretty
closely
and
is
as
closely
watched
she
replied
have
you
found
out
anything
which
affects
me
ellerey
asked
after
a
pause
she
hesitated
not
directly
indirectly
then
perhaps
a
little
it
is
a
small
matter
but
it
interested
me
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
sturatzberg
but
with
england
ellerey
was
silent
could
lord
cloverton
have
repeated
his
story
may
i
know
the
nature
of
the
crime
is
it
which
is
imputed
to
me
it
is
no
crime
captain
ellerey
rather
a
romance
i
should
have
repudiated
the
idea
of
a
crime
in
connection
with
you
countess
that
is
the
kindest
thing
you
have
ever
said
to
me
she
looked
into
his
face
and
the
color
came
into
her
own
are
we
not
friends
she
said
and
is
it
not
the
elemental
part
of
friendship
to
believe
nothing
ill
i
would
hardly
believe
a
confession
of
crime
though
your
own
lips
spoke
it
no
this
information
was
about
a
woman
unknown
women
are
a
dangerous
subject
between
us
countess
said
ellerey
with
a
smile
i
am
barely
forgiven
yet
for
the
mysterious
lady
of
the
altstrasse
this
is
not
an
unknown
woman
but
a
very
famous
one
none
other
than
princess
maritza
of
wallaria
you
have
heard
of
her
i
have
not
only
heard
of
her
but
seen
her
and
spoken
to
her
and
admired
her
she
asked
yes
her
beauty
and
her
indomitable
courage
that
is
what
i
heard
that
you
admired
her
it
is
a
very
strange
thing
for
you
to
hear
i
only
saw
her
once
for
ten
minutes
perhaps
she
was
a
schoolgirl
and
playing
truant
we
met
upon
the
downs
one
breezy
morning
a
hat
blown
away
by
the
wind
served
for
introduction
and
i
have
never
seen
her
since
it
was
not
for
her
sake
then
that
you
came
to
wallaria
ah
is
that
what
lord
cloverton
thinks
exclaimed
ellerey
now
i
understand
his
attitude
more
clearly
you
do
not
answer
my
question
she
said
her
story
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
wallaria
certainly
gave
me
the
idea
of
seeking
fortune
in
this
country
and
love
she
said
ellerey
looked
at
her
quickly
and
wondered
he
was
not
one
of
those
who
believe
that
they
have
the
power
of
charming
any
woman
and
his
companion
sudden
question
and
attitude
startled
him
more
than
one
answer
sprang
to
his
lips
ready
to
trip
lightly
and
pleasantly
to
her
ears
but
they
were
not
spoken
instead
he
laughed
gayly
and
said
a
princess
and
a
poor
captain
of
horse
countess
such
a
flight
of
fancy
after
ten
minutes
conversation
oh
you
jest
and
laugh
at
me
there
was
a
further
question
in
her
glance
and
attitude
but
it
was
not
asked
for
a
man
appeared
at
the
entrance
of
the
alcove
i
have
been
seeking
you
captain
ellerey
he
said
her
majesty
commands
your
attendance
will
you
come
with
me
ellerey
rose
at
once
you
will
pardon
me
countess
i
must
make
another
opportunity
of
quarrelling
with
you
for
laughing
at
me
shall
i
take
you
back
to
the
no
thank
you
i
am
tired
and
will
stay
here
and
with
a
low
bow
ellerey
left
her
the
fact
that
he
had
been
sent
for
and
the
probable
meaning
of
that
interview
did
not
take
first
place
in
frina
mavrodin
thoughts
for
a
time
she
was
considering
ellerey
answer
to
her
question
trying
to
understand
it
when
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
princess
declaration
maritza
could
only
have
intended
her
to
understand
one
thing
and
she
had
endeavored
to
surprise
the
truth
from
captain
ellerey
had
she
succeeded
in
learning
anything
surely
in
such
a
casual
meeting
no
lasting
impression
could
have
been
formed
and
yet
love
works
in
sudden
and
inexplicable
fashion
sometimes
the
princess
seemed
to
have
treasured
the
memory
of
that
meeting
ellerey
admitted
that
it
was
the
cause
of
his
coming
to
sturatzberg
frina
mavrodin
remembered
as
though
they
had
been
noted
down
in
one
continuous
story
everything
captain
ellerey
had
ever
said
to
her
and
the
manner
in
which
he
had
said
it
she
had
allowed
herself
to
indulge
in
a
dream
which
had
had
naught
but
pleasure
in
it
until
the
princess
had
looked
into
her
eyes
in
so
strange
a
fashion
and
now
that
she
had
sought
the
truth
from
ellerey
himself
she
was
still
left
in
doubt
in
a
uncertainty
which
had
a
sense
of
pain
in
it
it
was
some
time
before
the
thought
that
ellerey
was
with
the
queen
came
uppermost
in
her
mind
urging
her
to
be
on
the
alert
she
was
in
the
act
of
rising
when
a
shadow
fell
upon
her
and
lord
cloverton
stood
in
the
entrance
alone
countess
he
exclaimed
what
great
event
has
happened
in
sturatzberg
none
that
i
am
aware
of
my
lord
and
yet
you
are
alone
it
is
so
rare
a
circumstance
that
you
must
pardon
my
astonishment
even
such
a
frivolous
person
as
i
am
welcomes
solitude
sometimes
she
answered
i
would
not
allow
my
dearest
friend
to
so
malign
you
countess
said
the
ambassador
seating
himself
beside
her
i
expected
to
find
captain
ellerey
with
you
you
wish
to
speak
with
him
yes
but
it
can
wait
answered
lord
cloverton
carelessly
success
is
the
result
of
skilfully
seizing
opportunities
and
in
finding
you
alone
an
opportunity
comes
to
me
will
you
spare
me
a
moment
she
bowed
a
smiling
acquiescence
as
though
the
question
were
unnecessary
like
me
countess
i
am
sure
you
take
little
interest
in
uninteresting
people
therefore
you
must
have
found
this
captain
ellerey
interesting
so
have
i
so
interesting
indeed
that
i
have
wondered
why
he
came
to
wallaria
he
has
not
given
me
so
much
of
his
confidence
as
you
appear
to
imagine
my
lord
he
has
not
told
you
ah
then
i
will
in
confidence
countess
in
confidence
i
understand
and
i
shall
respect
it
she
answered
eager
to
learn
what
explanation
the
ambassador
would
give
he
had
enemies
in
england
who
made
certain
charges
against
him
which
were
absolutely
without
foundation
but
so
skilfully
had
they
been
manipulated
that
captain
ellerey
was
unable
to
prove
them
false
his
nature
is
an
impatient
one
and
in
anger
he
turned
his
back
upon
england
and
came
to
sturatzberg
in
wallaria
there
were
possibilities
i
can
understand
his
action
countess
it
was
a
natural
one
in
a
man
of
his
independent
character
but
it
was
foolish
it
gave
credence
to
the
tales
which
had
been
circulated
now
countess
influential
friends
have
taken
up
his
case
and
he
ought
to
go
back
to
england
but
why
tell
this
to
me
my
lord
a
woman
persuasion
countess
is
she
looked
at
him
quickly
but
you
have
told
me
this
in
confidence
how
can
i
approach
the
subject
and
yet
keep
confidence
you
flatter
me
most
delicately
by
asking
my
advice
on
such
a
matter
is
it
not
true
that
a
woman
can
frame
her
questions
so
that
a
man
is
compelled
to
answer
some
men
perhaps
captain
ellerey
i
think
said
the
ambassador
under
certain
conditions
exactly
he
answered
when
the
questions
are
asked
by
one
particular
woman
she
said
you
have
caught
my
meaning
exactly
countess
but
as
it
happens
lord
cloverton
i
am
not
the
one
particular
woman
the
ambassador
turned
a
smiling
countenance
toward
her
my
dear
lady
you
do
yourself
a
gross
injustice
the
look
he
expected
to
find
in
her
face
he
did
not
see
there
he
had
believed
himself
possessed
of
one
secret
he
suddenly
perceived
that
he
had
possibly
discovered
another
one
that
might
be
even
more
certainly
used
to
his
own
advantage
and
he
made
haste
to
turn
it
to
account
if
i
am
mistaken
he
said
slowly
captain
ellerey
sinks
in
my
estimation
as
a
stone
in
water
if
i
am
wrong
your
displeasure
should
urge
his
return
to
england
for
he
is
no
fit
cavalier
for
countess
mavrodin
he
would
be
a
mere
adventurer
to
whom
every
woman
is
a
pleasant
plaything
one
whose
honor
is
for
barter
to
the
highest
bidder
such
men
may
well
be
advised
to
return
to
their
native
land
as
i
am
not
the
one
particular
woman
so
am
i
not
a
plaything
my
lord
has
your
philosophy
no
position
which
a
woman
may
occupy
between
the
two
in
this
case
i
think
not
such
a
small
position
as
friendship
for
instance
she
said
rising
captain
ellerey
and
i
are
fast
friends
i
hardly
know
whether
i
can
congratulate
you
said
lord
cloverton
rising
too
and
showing
no
sign
of
annoyance
or
recognition
of
defeat
you
will
pardon
me
but
i
fear
i
may
have
been
missed
and
then
as
they
passed
into
the
he
went
on
i
will
respect
your
confidence
but
may
i
suggest
that
your
knowledge
of
captain
affairs
may
be
useful
to
him
why
not
advise
him
yourself
at
present
he
is
with
the
queen
when
i
see
him
again
i
will
tell
him
that
you
wish
to
speak
to
him
i
have
already
given
him
my
advice
countess
i
thought
to
do
him
a
service
by
sending
him
a
more
powerful
advocate
and
the
ambassador
left
her
and
went
quickly
toward
the
vestibule
as
she
turned
monsieur
de
froilette
bowed
low
to
her
he
too
was
hastening
toward
the
vestibule
when
desmond
ellerey
had
followed
the
messenger
across
the
his
guide
suddenly
paused
and
said
in
a
low
tone
her
majesty
is
in
her
private
apartment
and
i
am
instructed
to
take
you
there
will
you
come
with
me
this
way
he
turned
from
the
ballroom
and
led
ellerey
along
a
corridor
and
through
a
door
which
he
locked
after
him
they
passed
up
one
corridor
and
down
another
for
a
little
distance
and
then
ushering
him
into
an
his
guide
left
him
there
while
he
went
to
inform
the
queen
of
his
arrival
in
a
few
moments
he
returned
and
holding
open
a
door
bid
him
enter
the
queen
was
alone
seated
by
a
table
at
which
she
had
been
writing
ellerey
approached
her
and
bent
over
her
hand
the
time
has
come
captain
ellerey
she
said
you
are
ready
i
am
only
waiting
your
majesty
commands
you
have
been
sent
once
or
twice
captain
ellerey
to
dislodge
a
certain
brigand
called
vasilici
from
his
fastnesses
in
the
mountains
and
have
experienced
disappointment
perhaps
in
not
finding
him
that
is
so
your
majesty
it
was
never
intended
that
you
should
find
him
she
answered
for
months
past
loyal
subjects
have
been
gathering
in
the
mountains
with
vasilici
waiting
for
our
word
to
revolt
against
the
thraldom
this
country
is
under
to
foreign
nations
in
the
future
it
is
for
us
to
dictate
not
to
obey
his
majesty
watched
as
he
is
can
not
act
freely
so
the
duty
devolves
on
me
it
is
for
you
to
proclaim
that
we
in
sturatzberg
are
ready
by
carrying
a
token
to
vasilici
which
i
will
give
you
and
which
you
must
guard
with
your
life
captain
ellerey
the
mission
with
which
you
are
intrusted
is
a
hazardous
one
faction
is
rife
in
the
country
and
spies
lurk
in
every
corner
of
it
even
now
there
may
be
some
setting
out
upon
the
road
to
bar
your
way
to
vasilici
but
for
the
trusted
bearer
of
this
token
await
high
honor
and
great
reward
even
for
a
foreigner
asked
ellerey
you
are
no
more
one
captain
ellerey
this
is
the
land
of
your
adoption
and
by
this
service
are
you
not
proving
yourself
a
worthy
son
your
majesty
commands
i
am
content
to
trust
to
your
majesty
for
my
reward
but
one
thing
troubles
me
what
is
that
the
revolution
for
such
it
must
be
will
heat
men
blood
against
the
foreigner
may
i
ask
consideration
for
lord
cloverton
and
his
staff
at
the
british
embassy
you
have
our
word
that
no
harm
shall
come
to
them
we
are
not
fighting
embassies
but
the
which
has
come
into
our
land
the
adventurers
who
bear
themselves
as
though
they
were
our
masters
we
have
been
under
an
iron
flail
from
the
palace
to
the
hovel
it
is
against
this
subjection
that
we
rebel
you
are
prepared
to
fight
and
win
with
us
i
am
waiting
for
the
token
your
majesty
i
love
a
man
of
few
words
she
said
and
as
surely
as
success
will
come
i
pledge
my
word
that
the
ribbon
of
the
golden
lion
of
sturatzberg
shall
be
yours
captain
ellerey
and
with
it
revenue
sufficient
to
bear
it
fittingly
this
is
the
token
she
went
on
baring
her
arm
on
which
just
above
the
elbow
was
a
bracelet
of
iron
a
chain
joining
together
four
medallions
it
is
an
ancient
treasure
of
wallaria
worn
it
is
said
by
savage
kings
in
this
country
before
ever
the
romans
had
trampled
it
with
their
legions
i
will
seal
it
in
this
box
which
you
must
guard
with
your
life
and
bear
to
vasilici
seeing
it
he
will
welcome
you
as
he
would
ourself
with
him
return
triumphantly
to
sturatzberg
and
if
a
rabble
of
rebellious
soldiery
led
away
by
traitors
who
are
among
us
stand
in
your
way
i
can
trust
captain
ellerey
sword
to
cut
a
path
through
it
will
you
unclasp
the
bracelet
for
me
the
fastening
is
difficult
as
she
held
out
her
arm
the
door
opened
and
the
servant
who
had
fetched
ellerey
entered
monsieur
de
froilette
your
majesty
has
just
informed
me
that
his
majesty
is
on
his
way
here
for
one
moment
the
queen
stood
undecided
do
not
unfasten
it
captain
ellerey
she
said
laying
a
detaining
hand
upon
his
some
time
before
midnight
it
shall
be
sent
to
you
not
to
your
lodging
that
might
be
dangerous
wait
for
it
at
the
toison
it
is
an
inn
of
no
repute
in
the
bergenstrasse
which
runs
toward
the
southern
gate
this
same
messenger
who
came
to
you
shall
bring
it
sealed
as
i
have
said
then
make
all
speed
to
vasilici
who
lies
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
drekner
pass
now
go
quickly
he
will
show
you
the
way
it
was
by
a
different
way
they
returned
the
toison
about
midnight
said
his
guide
as
he
stood
to
open
a
door
and
monsieur
would
do
well
to
leave
his
lodging
by
the
western
gate
as
soon
as
he
has
prepared
for
the
journey
this
passage
will
take
monsieur
to
the
vestibule
as
he
went
toward
the
staircase
determined
to
leave
the
palace
at
once
ellerey
saw
baron
petrescu
leaning
against
the
marble
balustrade
talking
to
one
of
his
companions
there
were
certain
men
at
court
who
appeared
to
follow
the
baron
like
his
shadow
he
was
watching
all
those
who
left
the
palace
as
carefully
as
on
a
former
occasion
he
had
scrutinized
all
those
who
entered
it
and
again
ellerey
appearance
seemed
to
release
him
from
his
labors
with
a
whispered
word
to
his
companion
he
moved
hastily
among
the
people
who
were
crossing
to
the
stairs
and
contriving
to
jostle
ellerey
came
to
a
standstill
directly
in
front
of
him
i
am
waiting
monsieur
he
said
for
what
your
apology
you
jest
with
me
i
have
none
to
make
monsieur
is
slow
to
appreciate
said
the
baron
with
a
curl
of
his
lip
he
forgets
that
he
has
stared
most
insufferably
at
me
on
many
occasions
and
that
now
he
attempts
to
bar
my
progress
i
appreciate
that
you
wish
to
quarrel
with
me
ellerey
answered
bluntly
but
i
am
in
no
mood
for
quarrelling
will
monsieur
oblige
by
standing
out
of
my
way
or
must
i
be
at
the
trouble
of
throwing
him
down
the
stairs
the
answer
came
quickly
and
was
to
the
point
with
a
sudden
sweep
of
his
arm
baron
petrescu
struck
ellerey
sharply
across
the
face
with
his
glove
perhaps
there
was
something
in
ellerey
expression
which
made
the
baron
companion
step
hastily
to
his
side
experience
may
have
taught
him
that
englishmen
have
a
strange
habit
of
punishing
such
insults
on
the
spot
with
a
total
disregard
of
all
formalities
perhaps
it
was
his
action
which
prevented
ellerey
carrying
out
his
intention
he
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
the
air
whistling
through
his
clenched
teeth
as
he
caught
his
breath
and
then
he
bowed
slightly
to
the
baron
who
turned
away
leaving
his
companion
to
settle
the
matter
monsieur
will
give
me
the
name
of
a
friend
so
that
we
may
arrange
for
this
affair
why
not
i
never
sleep
upon
my
quarrels
impossible
monsieur
is
not
the
choice
with
me
certainly
but
then
i
say
ellerey
answered
there
was
a
moon
when
i
entered
the
palace
the
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
disgusted
at
the
utter
barbarity
of
these
englishmen
the
name
of
your
friend
then
monsieur
ellerey
was
in
a
difficulty
he
could
think
of
no
one
to
whom
he
was
desirous
of
intrusting
an
affair
of
this
kind
before
he
could
reply
however
he
felt
a
touch
upon
his
arm
can
i
be
of
service
the
speaker
was
an
englishman
and
a
stranger
to
him
you
will
be
doing
me
a
great
favor
monsieur
and
i
thank
you
the
stranger
at
once
went
aside
with
the
baron
friend
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
come
captain
ellerey
it
is
in
half
an
hour
time
and
with
an
assenting
inclination
of
his
head
ellerey
went
slowly
down
the
stairs
with
his
companion
as
he
did
so
a
woman
came
from
a
corner
and
leaning
over
the
balustrade
watched
the
descending
figures
her
face
was
pale
and
her
lips
trembled
i
have
sought
you
for
my
promised
dance
said
a
voice
behind
her
what
is
interesting
the
countess
so
much
i
was
thinking
that
the
moon
will
be
setting
shortly
she
answered
in
an
hour
it
will
be
dark
or
very
nearly
well
countess
what
can
that
matter
said
the
austrian
she
looked
at
him
vaguely
for
a
moment
thinking
of
the
man
who
had
just
descended
the
stairs
then
she
said
with
manifest
effort
and
a
faint
smile
as
she
laid
her
hand
upon
the
arm
no
indeed
what
can
it
matter
to
me
chapter
viii
the
iron
bracelet
when
lord
cloverton
left
frina
mavrodin
he
hurried
to
the
vestibule
and
sent
a
message
to
the
king
asking
for
an
immediate
and
private
audience
and
de
froilette
saw
the
ambassador
go
to
the
king
private
apartment
soon
afterward
de
froilette
knew
that
this
sudden
audience
could
only
relate
to
one
of
two
matters
either
lord
cloverton
had
made
some
discovery
respecting
the
princess
maritza
or
else
he
was
aware
that
ellerey
was
with
the
queen
and
was
about
to
make
some
move
which
would
defeat
any
conspiracy
which
might
be
in
progress
that
the
ambassador
had
any
idea
of
the
real
state
of
affairs
de
froilette
did
not
believe
he
did
not
go
at
once
to
warn
the
queen
it
was
only
as
the
king
and
the
minister
were
leaving
the
private
apartments
that
he
realized
the
danger
lord
cloverton
was
troubled
the
various
pieces
of
the
puzzle
which
he
had
fitted
into
places
to
his
satisfaction
suddenly
seemed
inadequate
to
fill
the
places
he
had
assigned
to
them
he
had
discovered
a
depth
in
frina
mavrodin
the
existence
of
which
he
had
never
suspected
she
had
fenced
him
with
his
own
weapons
in
a
manner
he
was
little
accustomed
to
and
he
had
signally
failed
to
make
use
of
her
in
the
way
he
desired
true
she
had
told
him
that
ellerey
was
with
the
queen
but
she
had
mentioned
it
as
a
circumstance
of
small
importance
was
it
was
the
casual
information
meant
to
mislead
him
this
frivolous
woman
was
beginning
to
take
a
new
position
in
the
calculations
and
he
began
almost
unconsciously
to
look
for
some
large
space
in
the
intricate
puzzle
which
she
might
possibly
fill
he
had
imagined
that
love
linked
her
to
desmond
ellerey
and
he
was
apparently
mistaken
it
was
only
friendship
and
such
friendship
might
mean
anything
he
spoke
to
captain
ward
telling
him
to
be
particularly
observant
of
ellerey
and
then
went
to
the
king
it
was
unusual
with
him
but
for
once
he
had
not
determined
what
course
of
action
to
take
even
when
he
entered
the
king
room
what
important
twist
have
affairs
taken
my
lord
asked
the
king
it
is
to
prevent
any
twist
that
i
ventured
to
ask
for
this
audience
your
majesty
i
am
forced
to
refer
again
to
a
subject
which
on
a
former
occasion
gave
you
some
displeasure
you
must
pardon
my
importunity
since
i
believe
the
danger
is
imminent
i
am
all
attention
the
king
answered
conscious
of
the
slight
embarrassment
there
was
in
lord
cloverton
manner
as
you
are
aware
the
ambassador
went
on
slowly
i
have
always
considered
many
of
the
plots
which
from
time
to
time
become
apparent
in
sturatzberg
of
small
importance
i
have
on
the
other
hand
consistently
warned
your
majesty
of
the
danger
which
might
at
any
time
manifest
itself
in
a
sudden
development
of
the
tactics
of
the
brigands
in
the
mountains
their
chief
vasilici
may
be
a
chief
only
in
name
and
it
is
certain
that
during
the
past
few
months
many
have
joined
him
who
are
not
brigands
in
any
sense
of
the
word
and
who
i
conceive
are
merely
using
this
outlaw
as
a
convenient
cloak
to
their
wider
and
more
sinister
intentions
certainly
you
have
always
been
an
alarmist
in
this
matter
said
the
king
with
a
smile
whatever
their
intentions
may
be
the
fact
remains
that
they
have
always
fled
at
the
approach
of
a
handful
of
troops
which
is
rather
unnatural
it
seems
to
me
lord
cloverton
answered
quickly
whatever
else
he
may
lack
your
brigand
is
not
deficient
in
courage
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
troops
sent
against
these
men
have
never
succeeded
in
finding
a
trace
of
their
spoils
do
you
suggest
that
they
have
been
warned
of
the
expeditions
sent
against
them
i
think
it
probable
by
whom
my
lord
we
might
laugh
at
the
danger
your
majesty
could
i
answer
that
question
replied
the
ambassador
it
must
be
remembered
that
there
are
many
in
sturatzberg
who
while
personally
loyal
to
you
are
not
satisfied
with
your
foreign
policy
who
believe
that
wallaria
is
too
much
under
the
direction
of
the
greater
european
powers
and
would
help
you
to
emancipation
in
spite
of
yourself
a
judgment
which
is
the
outcome
of
ignorance
lord
cloverton
i
think
so
but
it
is
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
do
returned
the
ambassador
such
a
feeling
is
prevalent
in
all
grades
of
society
in
sturatzberg
from
her
majesty
queen
elena
down
to
the
beggars
in
the
altstrasse
the
queen
my
lord
exclaimed
the
king
sharply
i
do
not
speak
hastily
your
majesty
queen
elena
has
all
those
attributes
which
go
to
make
a
great
ruler
she
has
courage
diplomacy
tact
and
deep
in
her
heart
lies
a
living
beating
interest
in
her
country
welfare
such
praise
seems
merely
the
mask
for
an
accusation
my
lord
i
must
request
you
to
be
more
explicit
to
be
so
your
majesty
was
my
reason
for
asking
for
this
interview
i
humbly
protest
however
that
i
make
no
accusation
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
her
majesty
conception
of
her
country
welfare
is
i
venture
to
think
an
erroneous
one
although
i
imagine
her
desire
is
only
to
help
forward
a
policy
which
she
believes
is
near
to
your
heart
enough
lord
cloverton
let
us
get
to
the
root
of
the
matter
quickly
our
absence
will
be
remarked
and
occasion
comment
the
king
spoke
irritably
and
the
ambassador
felt
the
delicacy
and
difficulty
of
the
position
he
was
not
quite
sure
of
his
ground
he
was
rather
in
the
position
of
one
who
draws
a
bow
at
a
venture
and
yet
he
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
in
which
direction
the
mark
lay
of
one
thing
he
was
certain
the
danger
and
he
felt
justified
in
taking
any
risk
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
trouble
the
queen
has
given
a
special
audience
to
a
countryman
of
mine
a
captain
desmond
ellerey
in
your
majesty
service
said
the
ambassador
speaking
quietly
and
concisely
this
captain
ellerey
is
a
man
of
courage
and
resource
in
a
way
an
adventurer
prepared
for
any
hazardous
enterprise
if
he
is
once
convinced
that
it
is
in
the
service
of
his
adopted
country
i
believe
the
queen
intends
to
send
him
upon
some
secret
mission
which
although
she
may
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
will
militate
against
your
majesty
and
against
your
peaceful
policy
an
accusation
of
treason
exclaimed
the
king
you
go
too
far
my
lord
i
make
no
such
accusation
i
only
fear
an
act
which
may
lead
to
treason
in
others
and
seek
to
prevent
it
why
not
question
captain
ellerey
i
have
done
so
but
to
no
purpose
i
will
question
him
said
the
king
why
not
question
her
majesty
lord
cloverton
suggested
captain
ellerey
is
with
her
at
this
moment
you
shall
go
with
me
lord
cloverton
said
the
king
since
you
have
such
suspicions
it
is
no
time
for
secret
questionings
her
majesty
shall
hear
your
accusation
and
shall
answer
it
the
ambassador
bowed
the
king
decision
pleased
him
if
he
had
not
succeeded
in
raising
the
king
suspicion
he
had
raised
his
anger
which
would
serve
the
same
purpose
and
lord
cloverton
still
held
the
trump
card
in
his
hand
the
moment
ellerey
had
left
her
the
queen
glanced
hastily
around
the
room
she
slipped
the
box
she
had
shown
him
underneath
some
papers
in
her
drawer
and
then
with
a
smile
reseated
herself
and
drawing
paper
toward
her
she
rapidly
began
to
write
a
note
to
frina
mavrodin
she
rose
quickly
with
a
little
gesture
of
surprise
when
the
king
and
the
english
ambassador
were
announced
the
king
strode
into
the
room
anger
still
in
his
face
but
lord
cloverton
came
to
a
halt
near
the
door
your
majesty
is
welcome
said
the
queen
but
you
look
troubled
i
fear
i
spend
too
little
time
helping
to
share
your
difficulties
to
defeat
intrigues
is
my
hourly
occupation
elena
but
there
are
some
intrigues
or
whispers
of
them
which
call
for
special
treatment
they
are
not
to
be
met
by
counterplot
but
by
open
speech
and
outspoken
denial
am
i
accused
the
queen
asked
lord
cloverton
has
seen
fit
to
warn
me
of
what
she
asked
innocently
looking
toward
the
ambassador
the
king
hesitated
for
a
moment
almost
as
though
he
wished
lord
cloverton
would
speak
you
have
received
captain
ellerey
in
private
audience
he
said
after
a
moment
pause
i
have
may
i
know
for
what
purpose
the
queen
looked
first
at
her
husband
then
at
the
ambassador
her
glance
lingering
on
the
latter
for
a
moment
i
can
not
tell
you
why
she
answered
slowly
it
was
a
matter
of
no
great
importance
but
it
was
essentially
private
i
would
be
unfair
to
captain
ellerey
to
speak
of
it
it
may
have
been
the
flicker
of
triumph
upon
the
ambassador
face
which
urged
the
king
on
we
expected
to
find
captain
ellerey
still
with
you
the
audience
was
a
short
one
was
the
answer
i
am
afraid
i
must
demand
to
know
its
purport
said
the
king
i
do
so
in
your
own
interests
you
wish
me
to
deny
some
accusation
lord
cloverton
has
made
against
me
i
tremble
lest
i
may
be
unable
to
do
so
of
what
frivolity
do
i
stand
accused
and
she
smiled
at
the
ambassador
with
an
innocent
expression
on
her
face
pleading
for
lenient
judgment
of
no
frivolity
said
the
king
lord
cloverton
has
suggested
that
you
have
despatched
this
captain
ellerey
upon
some
secret
mission
to
the
enemies
of
our
country
seeking
to
do
us
a
service
but
in
truth
jeopardizing
our
policy
of
peace
perchance
our
throne
in
substance
my
lord
that
is
your
accusation
i
think
that
is
so
returned
the
ambassador
to
what
enemies
asked
the
queen
after
a
pause
is
there
any
need
to
particularize
said
the
king
irritably
the
accusation
is
either
true
or
false
it
is
false
the
denial
was
quietly
spoken
but
an
angry
flush
glowed
in
her
cheeks
by
your
majesty
leave
such
an
accusation
should
be
definite
and
again
i
ask
what
enemies
i
will
be
definite
said
lord
cloverton
doubtless
you
have
not
considered
well
be
direct
too
my
lord
what
enemies
i
will
i
mean
those
enemies
who
are
in
communication
with
the
traitors
who
have
joined
the
brigand
vasilici
in
the
mountains
you
accuse
me
of
holding
communication
with
these
men
your
majesty
must
pardon
my
bluntness
i
do
you
are
pardoned
and
thanked
also
she
said
lightly
such
bluntness
comes
more
directly
at
the
heart
of
the
matter
than
much
diplomacy
and
is
more
easily
answered
i
deny
the
charge
and
then
turning
to
the
king
she
went
on
for
my
own
protection
i
am
constrained
to
tell
you
the
purpose
of
captain
ellerey
visit
to
me
he
has
quickly
received
the
favor
of
one
of
the
ladies
of
our
court
a
favor
for
which
i
am
in
some
measure
responsible
when
captain
ellerey
first
came
among
us
he
furnished
us
with
subject
for
jesting
by
declaring
that
no
woman
had
ever
played
a
serious
part
in
his
life
i
expressed
a
belief
that
such
a
statement
would
rouse
feminine
enthusiasm
in
sturatzberg
and
i
have
since
often
questioned
him
whether
he
could
truthfully
repeat
the
declaration
it
was
a
jest
but
seriousness
has
come
of
it
captain
ellerey
ambition
has
flown
high
even
to
the
countess
mavrodin
such
an
ambition
must
bring
him
bitter
enemies
in
numbers
like
leaves
in
autumn
and
if
i
have
persuaded
him
against
soaring
so
high
if
i
have
made
frina
mavrodin
position
in
sturatzberg
plainer
to
him
and
endeavored
privately
to
warn
him
against
such
an
ambition
have
i
done
aught
to
pander
to
my
country
enemies
or
to
jeopardize
your
majesty
throne
the
question
was
asked
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
the
king
laugh
no
but
by
my
faith
your
interference
may
have
jeopardized
the
happiness
is
she
to
have
no
voice
in
the
matter
i
fear
she
is
somewhat
fascinated
by
captain
ellerey
said
the
queen
with
a
smile
but
such
a
thing
as
marriage
is
not
to
be
thought
of
think
of
it
frina
mavrodin
and
a
captain
of
horse
you
english
place
no
limits
to
your
ambition
she
added
turning
to
lord
cloverton
love
leaps
over
all
obstacles
said
the
king
but
her
majesty
was
ready
with
arguments
to
prove
that
the
affair
was
no
laughing
matter
she
even
suggested
that
such
a
marriage
might
have
a
political
significance
might
lead
to
complications
which
would
have
serious
consequences
even
to
some
revolution
such
as
lord
cloverton
had
accused
her
of
fostering
it
was
no
laughing
matter
as
his
majesty
would
make
it
and
her
interference
was
not
unnecessary
but
intended
to
serve
the
state
even
were
captain
ellerey
to
rise
to
great
distinction
she
argued
such
an
alliance
would
still
be
fraught
with
danger
the
countess
mavrodin
with
her
wealth
with
her
prestige
and
her
close
connection
with
the
noblest
houses
in
sturatzberg
was
not
for
a
soldier
of
fortune
as
at
the
best
captain
ellerey
was
she
became
eloquent
upon
the
subject
and
the
king
watched
the
ambassador
a
smile
upon
his
lips
in
anticipation
of
his
discomfiture
i
had
already
begun
a
letter
to
the
countess
said
the
queen
taking
up
the
paper
on
which
she
had
written
a
few
lines
i
want
to
show
her
plainly
the
impossibility
of
such
a
thing
are
you
satisfied
lord
cloverton
the
ambassador
had
remained
standing
by
the
door
and
had
not
taken
his
eyes
from
the
queen
as
she
talked
rapidly
there
was
no
expression
on
his
face
to
indicate
his
thoughts
now
he
advanced
your
majesty
thinks
then
that
this
folly
so
far
as
the
countess
mavrodin
is
concerned
is
a
serious
matter
i
want
to
find
out
if
i
am
any
judge
it
is
said
lord
cloverton
more
serious
with
the
lady
than
with
the
man
her
words
went
far
to
confirm
my
ideas
respecting
captain
ellerey
her
manner
betrayed
her
own
secret
you
have
spoken
to
her
yes
only
your
majesty
exaggerates
the
political
significance
of
such
a
marriage
i
feel
sure
it
would
make
enemies
for
captain
ellerey
no
doubt
but
he
is
the
kind
of
man
who
is
very
capable
of
defending
himself
a
greatly
daring
englishmen
is
an
awkward
man
to
encounter
and
there
seems
to
be
a
general
desire
to
enlist
the
sympathy
of
desmond
ellerey
that
has
made
me
suspicious
and
using
some
knowledge
which
i
possess
concerning
him
i
have
endeavored
to
make
him
apply
for
leave
to
return
to
england
to
save
him
from
the
countess
said
the
queen
no
your
majesty
to
prevent
his
being
drawn
into
a
plot
which
seeks
to
overthrow
the
present
government
of
this
country
is
there
such
a
plot
she
asked
innocently
a
dozen
have
existed
ever
since
i
came
to
the
throne
said
the
king
the
ambassador
persistency
made
him
angry
hiding
themselves
in
holes
like
hunted
vermin
lord
cloverton
returned
sharply
afraid
to
strike
afraid
to
be
seen
with
no
plan
of
action
ready
and
altogether
futile
i
do
not
speak
of
such
plots
as
these
but
of
one
particular
plot
whose
ramifications
spread
and
grow
from
end
to
end
of
wallaria
penetrating
to
the
very
heart
of
the
nation
as
surely
as
tree
roots
push
their
way
to
water
the
head
of
it
looks
up
watchfully
from
the
hidden
intrenchments
on
the
mountains
at
intervals
waiting
for
the
moment
to
strike
anxiously
is
it
waiting
now
for
what
cried
the
king
in
heaven
name
for
what
lord
cloverton
for
the
token
her
majesty
delivered
to
captain
ellerey
a
profound
silence
followed
this
deliberate
accusation
so
unflinchingly
was
it
made
so
evident
was
it
that
the
ambassador
had
some
knowledge
which
he
had
not
divulged
that
the
king
found
no
words
to
utter
he
looked
helplessly
at
the
queen
like
a
man
who
has
received
a
blow
which
has
dazed
him
for
the
time
being
the
ambassador
knowledge
startled
the
queen
too
but
she
did
not
shrink
before
his
steady
scrutiny
she
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
i
gave
no
such
token
she
said
lord
cloverton
started
slightly
at
being
given
the
lie
so
directly
what
subterfuge
was
a
woman
not
capable
of
you
have
your
answer
my
lord
said
the
king
moving
toward
his
wife
the
ambassador
bowed
he
could
hardly
pursue
the
matter
further
unless
the
king
assisted
him
and
he
turned
to
leave
the
room
you
are
not
satisfied
said
the
king
sternly
no
your
majesty
what
proof
can
you
have
what
was
the
token
lord
cloverton
turned
quickly
it
was
the
very
question
he
had
hoped
for
a
sacred
treasure
of
sturatzberg
the
iron
bracelet
her
majesty
is
accustomed
to
wear
upon
her
arm
again
there
was
silence
and
set
as
his
face
was
the
mask
was
insufficient
to
hide
the
excitement
the
queen
stood
for
a
moment
quite
conscious
of
the
dramatic
effect
of
the
silent
pause
and
then
she
made
three
rapid
strides
toward
the
ambassador
with
a
sudden
sweep
of
her
right
hand
she
ripped
open
the
left
sleeve
of
her
gown
from
wrist
to
shoulder
and
thrust
out
her
arm
to
him
i
demand
your
apology
lord
cloverton
she
stood
imperiously
before
him
looking
down
at
him
fire
was
in
her
eyes
an
angry
flush
upon
her
cheeks
triumph
in
look
and
gesture
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
any
subject
who
had
dared
to
accuse
her
the
ambassador
was
obliged
to
murmur
his
apology
for
tightly
clasped
upon
the
gleaming
white
and
rounded
arm
was
the
bracelet
of
iron
chapter
ix
the
duel
the
aspect
of
the
night
had
changed
when
ellerey
and
his
companion
left
the
palace
fleecy
clouds
raced
across
the
sky
veiling
the
face
of
the
moon
at
intervals
and
making
her
light
fitful
and
uncertain
the
air
struck
cold
after
the
warmth
within
but
beyond
drawing
his
cloak
a
little
closer
round
him
desmond
ellerey
seemed
indifferent
to
the
night
and
to
the
business
he
had
in
hand
he
asked
no
questions
and
with
his
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
followed
his
companion
mechanically
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
interested
him
more
than
the
issue
of
it
why
had
baron
petrescu
drawn
him
into
this
duel
it
had
obviously
been
carefully
planned
and
the
insult
deliberately
given
at
a
moment
when
ellerey
was
least
desirous
of
placing
his
life
in
jeopardy
he
could
only
assume
that
her
schemes
were
to
some
extent
at
least
known
to
the
baron
and
that
having
other
interests
to
serve
he
was
bent
on
incapacitating
him
from
performing
the
mission
he
had
undertaken
that
the
baron
had
any
personal
quarrel
with
him
he
did
not
believe
ellerey
companion
on
the
other
hand
was
interested
in
the
night
each
time
the
moonlight
grew
pale
or
died
out
altogether
for
a
moment
he
looked
at
the
sky
and
glanced
quickly
at
ellerey
he
was
the
more
excited
of
the
two
this
is
a
treacherous
light
for
our
work
he
said
presently
we
should
have
been
wiser
to
have
waited
until
morning
i
have
other
work
for
the
morning
ellerey
answered
are
you
a
skilful
swordsman
the
baron
is
is
he
said
ellerey
indifferently
i
have
some
reputation
in
my
regiment
but
doubtless
i
shall
be
a
better
judge
of
my
skill
presently
where
do
we
go
to
tell
the
truth
i
hardly
like
the
rendezvous
was
the
answer
it
is
a
stretch
of
sward
behind
an
obscure
tavern
in
this
part
of
the
town
did
i
not
know
the
baron
to
be
an
honorable
man
i
should
have
refused
the
meeting
in
such
a
place
your
decision
to
fight
made
our
choice
limited
ellerey
stopped
and
looked
about
him
they
had
turned
from
a
side
street
into
a
narrow
thoroughfare
with
tall
dark
houses
on
either
side
the
neighborhood
looked
particularly
uninviting
where
are
we
he
asked
suddenly
remembering
that
he
knew
nothing
of
his
companion
and
that
by
accepting
the
service
he
had
so
readily
offered
he
might
be
quietly
stepping
into
a
trap
such
a
thing
would
agree
very
well
with
the
rest
of
baron
petrescu
behavior
beyond
knowing
that
we
are
in
the
purlieus
of
a
lower
part
of
the
town
and
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
i
am
as
puzzled
as
you
are
you
seem
very
credulous
of
the
baron
honesty
monsieur
to
agree
so
such
a
place
as
this
which
way
now
to
the
bottom
of
this
street
where
we
are
to
wait
the
baron
friend
will
meet
us
there
we
will
keep
the
appointment
so
far
said
ellerey
shortly
i
came
to
meet
baron
petrescu
but
i
am
not
minded
to
step
blindly
into
a
nest
of
he
strode
on
as
alert
now
as
he
had
been
indifferent
before
and
it
was
not
until
they
had
nearly
reached
the
end
of
the
street
that
his
companion
spoke
one
moment
he
said
by
that
light
yonder
we
are
to
wait
you
do
not
trust
me
captain
ellerey
i
have
not
said
so
that
admits
my
statement
was
the
answer
until
a
moment
ago
that
aspect
of
the
case
had
not
presented
itself
to
me
but
on
reflection
i
can
hardly
wonder
at
your
distrust
the
circumstances
tell
against
me
but
had
i
been
in
any
conspiracy
against
you
i
should
hardly
have
called
your
attention
to
the
strangeness
of
the
rendezvous
i
have
however
a
better
guarantee
of
my
honesty
i
am
a
countryman
of
yours
an
englishman
i
like
this
affair
as
little
as
you
do
but
if
you
are
minded
to
see
it
through
i
have
a
sword
and
the
will
to
fight
beside
you
should
there
be
any
attempt
at
treachery
there
my
hand
upon
it
it
was
not
the
words
but
the
manner
in
which
they
were
spoken
that
convinced
ellerey
and
he
took
the
hand
held
out
to
him
forgive
my
momentary
suspicion
he
said
we
meet
by
the
light
yonder
you
say
the
light
came
from
a
dim
lamp
in
an
upper
window
it
might
have
been
placed
there
as
a
signal
or
some
poor
seamstress
in
the
struggle
for
a
livelihood
might
be
ruining
her
health
and
sight
by
it
it
must
at
any
rate
have
been
very
constantly
there
or
it
would
not
so
readily
have
been
mentioned
to
mark
a
place
of
meeting
as
they
went
toward
it
the
figures
of
two
men
became
dimly
visible
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
one
advanced
to
meet
them
and
addressed
himself
to
ellerey
companion
i
much
regret
this
unusual
mode
of
procedure
but
it
is
unavoidable
under
the
circumstances
and
in
view
of
your
friend
decision
to
fight
may
i
request
that
you
will
follow
us
in
silence
the
other
man
moved
from
the
shadow
it
was
baron
petrescu
and
going
to
the
house
which
was
next
to
that
in
which
the
lamp
shone
he
knocked
twice
at
the
door
in
a
peculiar
manner
which
was
evidently
a
known
summons
to
those
within
some
considerable
time
elapsed
before
the
summons
was
answered
but
the
baron
showed
no
impatience
and
this
manifest
knowledge
of
the
ways
of
the
establishment
did
not
inspire
ellerey
with
confidence
once
within
murder
and
concealment
of
the
crime
might
be
easy
who
was
there
in
all
sturatzberg
to
know
that
he
had
ever
entered
this
house
and
how
many
were
there
in
the
wide
world
to
care
whether
he
ever
left
it
presently
the
door
opened
a
little
space
and
a
shaggy
head
was
thrust
out
in
a
truculent
manner
whether
the
baron
spoke
to
him
or
whether
the
man
recognized
his
visitor
ellerey
could
not
determine
but
the
door
was
opened
wide
and
they
were
admitted
into
a
small
lobby
the
entrance
was
a
private
one
not
a
usual
entrance
but
the
smell
of
stale
liquor
and
smoke
and
the
reek
of
highly
spiced
dishes
proved
that
the
was
under
the
same
roof
and
proclaimed
it
as
a
resort
of
that
lower
stratum
of
society
which
loves
its
food
pungent
and
highly
flavored
that
there
was
such
silence
in
the
house
was
surprising
a
private
visit
theodor
said
the
baron
we
do
not
join
the
assembly
reassure
them
and
let
us
have
a
word
with
you
theodor
opened
one
of
the
in
the
lobby
and
in
a
stentorian
voice
shouted
some
word
which
ellerey
did
not
catch
its
effect
was
magical
immediately
there
arose
a
loud
hum
of
voices
the
clinking
and
clatter
of
innumerable
glasses
and
plates
and
the
rattle
of
dice
and
dominoes
then
theodor
let
the
door
swing
to
again
muffling
the
sounds
of
this
living
hive
and
led
the
way
into
a
small
bare
room
at
the
side
the
baron
companion
now
became
the
spokesman
we
have
a
little
matter
to
settle
theodor
a
private
quarrel
which
does
concern
the
good
fellows
yonder
and
of
which
they
must
know
nothing
the
grass
alley
in
the
garden
will
serve
our
purpose
let
us
out
quietly
and
have
a
care
that
no
one
wanders
that
way
to
cool
an
aching
head
until
we
have
departed
theodor
looked
from
the
speaker
to
his
companions
each
in
turn
and
ellerey
keenly
watched
the
man
eyes
to
note
if
any
look
of
understanding
were
exchanged
he
could
detect
none
of
course
of
course
it
is
a
good
spot
for
such
matter
but
if
one
is
killed
well
theodor
there
is
earth
enough
in
the
garden
for
burial
theodor
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
you
will
call
none
to
help
you
with
that
work
no
have
i
not
said
that
the
matter
is
private
and
there
is
no
surgeon
i
have
sufficient
skill
for
that
was
the
answer
come
theodor
time
presses
and
the
moon
will
not
serve
us
long
is
it
in
the
cause
no
said
baron
petrescu
sharply
as
though
he
were
afraid
some
different
answer
would
be
given
but
ellerey
could
not
help
believing
that
the
cause
whatever
it
might
be
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
affair
that
the
baron
had
designedly
insulted
him
that
evening
because
of
it
and
that
his
speedy
removal
was
considered
necessary
to
the
of
it
theodor
did
not
seem
to
believe
the
baron
statement
either
but
it
was
apparent
that
either
he
had
not
the
power
or
the
desire
to
oppose
the
baron
for
he
answered
quickly
i
see
will
an
hour
be
enough
more
than
enough
good
then
in
one
hour
i
will
walk
through
the
garden
and
shall
find
it
empty
i
shall
know
that
anyone
with
an
aching
head
is
free
to
cool
it
there
and
if
there
be
a
grave
to
trample
on
what
matter
no
one
will
know
without
further
words
he
led
the
way
down
a
narrow
passage
at
the
end
of
which
he
quietly
unbarred
a
door
three
steps
down
he
said
by
way
of
caution
as
he
stood
aside
to
let
them
pass
he
watched
them
until
their
figures
were
lost
in
the
shadows
of
the
garden
and
then
he
closed
and
barred
the
door
again
it
was
a
garden
of
some
extent
and
little
heaps
of
chairs
and
small
tables
showed
that
on
warm
nights
the
frequenters
of
the
cafe
drank
their
wine
and
threw
their
dice
there
instead
of
within
the
lights
in
the
house
the
cafe
seemed
to
occupy
only
the
back
of
it
shone
through
the
shrubberies
and
the
murmur
and
clatter
were
plainly
audible
as
the
four
men
crossed
the
lawn
and
went
toward
the
end
of
the
garden
along
tortuous
paths
which
made
the
really
short
distance
seem
a
long
one
at
last
they
came
out
on
to
a
level
piece
of
turf
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
high
hedges
through
which
were
many
openings
leading
to
other
parts
of
the
garden
and
through
one
of
which
they
had
come
there
were
trees
here
and
there
the
long
shadows
thrown
across
the
turf
and
without
absolutely
obscuring
the
moonlight
they
made
it
extremely
difficult
to
fight
a
duel
by
baron
petrescu
walked
to
one
end
of
the
lawn
and
ellerey
to
the
other
leaving
the
two
seconds
together
to
make
final
arrangements
once
convinced
that
his
adversary
contemplated
no
treachery
ellerey
sank
again
into
his
indifferent
state
paying
no
attention
to
the
choosing
of
the
ground
taking
no
note
of
the
light
nor
considering
how
he
might
best
use
his
position
to
the
full
advantage
the
baron
on
the
other
hand
was
quick
to
observe
exactly
how
the
shadows
fell
and
to
calculate
every
chance
which
might
help
him
we
are
ready
captain
ellerey
without
a
word
ellerey
threw
off
his
cloak
and
coat
and
taking
his
sword
weighed
it
in
his
hand
testing
its
poise
and
balance
in
case
of
accident
is
there
anything
you
wish
me
to
do
asked
his
companion
anything
to
take
charge
of
any
message
to
send
the
affair
has
been
so
hurried
that
there
has
been
no
time
to
make
these
small
arrangements
thank
you
there
is
nothing
ellerey
answered
under
the
circumstances
i
am
fortunate
in
not
possessing
a
friend
in
the
world
who
cares
a
snap
of
his
fingers
whether
i
am
living
or
dead
nor
a
woman
ellerey
hesitated
for
a
moment
the
countess
mavrodin
might
be
interested
to
learn
that
i
was
dead
yes
if
anything
should
happen
please
tell
her
but
in
england
there
is
no
one
ellerey
answered
a
cloud
passed
over
the
moon
as
the
combatants
faced
each
other
and
not
until
it
had
passed
was
the
signal
given
then
steel
rang
on
steel
with
a
music
which
sounded
weirdly
in
the
night
no
other
sound
was
there
save
a
rustling
in
the
leaves
now
and
again
as
though
they
trembled
in
sympathy
to
some
swift
lunge
or
quickly
parried
thrust
the
moon
shone
clearly
for
a
space
touching
the
swords
into
two
streaks
of
flashing
light
and
painting
the
men
set
faces
with
a
cold
hue
ghostly
and
deathlike
the
baron
had
a
reputation
as
a
swordsman
had
stood
face
to
face
with
an
antagonist
many
times
before
and
more
than
once
had
seen
his
adversary
turn
sightless
eyes
to
the
morning
sky
it
was
therefore
perhaps
only
natural
that
he
should
have
contemplated
his
encounter
with
the
englishman
with
equanimity
at
the
same
time
ellerey
determination
to
settle
the
quarrel
at
once
and
by
moonlight
may
have
had
the
effect
of
making
him
more
cautious
than
usual
certainly
his
second
who
had
often
seen
him
fight
before
marvelled
at
his
deliberation
the
brilliancy
of
his
attacks
was
wanting
and
he
could
only
suppose
that
the
englishman
was
a
more
worthy
swordsman
than
he
had
imagined
whatever
deliberation
the
baron
used
he
at
first
pressed
the
fight
far
more
than
ellerey
whose
whole
attention
seemed
occupied
in
defending
himself
he
was
less
attractive
to
watch
than
the
baron
slower
it
seemed
in
his
movements
and
with
less
invention
and
resource
yet
petrescu
appeared
to
gain
no
advantage
every
thrust
he
made
was
parried
if
rather
late
sometimes
still
parried
and
he
found
that
his
adversary
wrist
if
less
flexible
than
his
own
was
of
iron
he
changed
his
tactics
he
pressed
the
fight
less
and
less
hoping
to
make
the
englishman
careless
and
tempt
him
to
attack
more
vigorously
in
a
measure
the
device
succeeded
point
began
to
flash
toward
him
with
a
persistency
he
had
not
expected
but
there
was
no
less
caution
twice
thrice
the
baron
used
a
feint
and
thrust
which
had
seldom
missed
their
intention
and
had
proved
the
undoing
of
many
an
adversary
but
now
they
were
met
in
the
only
manner
it
seemed
that
they
could
be
met
successfully
at
the
third
failure
the
baron
computation
of
the
englishman
skill
underwent
a
rapid
change
he
had
met
his
match
a
foeman
worthy
of
his
steel
as
consummate
a
swordsman
as
himself
and
if
for
a
moment
there
was
a
sense
of
disappointment
it
was
quickly
followed
by
one
of
keen
satisfaction
not
unmingled
with
a
feeling
of
friendship
for
his
antagonist
there
was
that
in
baron
petrescu
which
he
had
received
no
credit
for
even
from
his
friends
what
contempt
he
had
had
for
ellerey
disappeared
and
a
desire
to
win
for
the
mere
sake
of
winning
took
possession
of
him
all
the
thoughts
which
had
prompted
him
to
this
duel
were
forgotten
he
was
no
longer
intent
on
killing
his
adversary
now
to
verify
his
superiority
and
to
prove
it
to
this
worthy
foeman
was
his
ambition
and
it
was
in
this
spirit
he
pressed
the
contest
with
increased
energy
the
night
became
full
of
eyes
for
him
eager
eyes
watchful
of
his
skill
and
hushed
in
the
silence
a
thousand
voices
seemed
ready
to
proclaim
his
victory
there
was
no
such
complication
of
thoughts
in
ellerey
mind
the
baron
had
grossly
insulted
him
had
forced
this
quarrel
upon
him
and
he
meant
to
punish
him
if
he
could
whether
he
killed
him
or
not
was
of
small
consequence
so
long
as
he
thoroughly
taught
him
a
lesson
yet
to
him
also
the
night
had
eyes
and
the
air
a
feeling
of
movement
in
it
stealthy
movement
that
walked
on
tiptoe
and
held
its
breath
the
steel
sang
now
high
now
low
distinct
sounds
and
continuous
the
breeze
rustled
the
leaves
then
and
again
but
something
else
was
stirring
in
the
night
now
behind
him
now
to
his
right
just
where
the
high
hedges
enclosed
the
lawn
once
he
heard
it
like
the
rustle
of
some
startled
animal
among
the
dried
and
fallen
leaves
and
again
he
heard
it
less
distinct
perhaps
but
more
pervading
as
when
a
crowd
waits
spellbound
the
baron
attack
grew
fiercer
again
twice
he
nearly
broke
through
ellerey
defence
just
when
the
sounds
were
audible
in
his
ears
the
baron
most
dangerous
thrusts
and
the
coming
of
the
sounds
seemed
to
synchronise
as
though
there
were
a
connection
between
them
as
though
they
were
parts
of
some
whole
ellerey
almost
expected
to
read
a
solution
of
the
mystery
in
his
opponent
eyes
which
glittered
in
his
pale
moonlit
face
but
the
solution
was
not
in
the
baron
eyes
it
was
behind
him
for
one
instant
ellerey
glanced
over
the
shoulder
to
the
hedge
beyond
and
in
an
alley
there
the
moonlight
fell
for
a
moment
upon
a
pale
face
thrust
forward
a
little
too
eagerly
the
night
was
alive
with
eyes
it
is
treachery
then
after
all
ellerey
burst
out
suddenly
and
as
he
spoke
he
used
the
baron
own
particular
feint
and
thrust
and
his
sword
point
ran
swiftly
and
smoothly
into
soft
flesh
with
a
low
cry
his
adversary
staggered
back
and
fell
and
in
that
moment
the
night
was
full
of
voices
too
men
rushed
with
angry
cries
and
gesticulations
from
every
alley
of
the
garden
some
to
this
side
some
to
that
to
surround
the
little
party
in
an
instant
the
seconds
had
drawn
their
swords
and
were
beside
ellerey
back
you
fools
came
faintly
from
the
wounded
man
but
the
eager
crowd
did
not
heed
even
if
they
heard
him
as
they
rushed
to
the
attack
in
overwhelming
numbers
on
my
oath
captain
ellerey
this
is
no
work
of
mine
said
the
baron
attempting
to
stagger
to
his
feet
but
falling
to
the
ground
again
his
second
too
shouted
to
the
crowd
using
the
baron
name
to
enforce
his
words
but
he
might
as
well
have
shrieked
forbiddance
to
the
incoming
tide
the
mad
crowd
rushed
upon
the
three
men
from
all
sides
and
although
the
flashing
swords
kept
them
back
for
a
few
moments
and
harsh
cries
told
that
one
blade
or
another
had
done
its
work
it
was
certain
that
only
in
flight
was
their
safety
against
such
odds
as
one
ruffian
staggered
back
with
a
yell
of
pain
from
the
point
of
ellerey
sword
the
baron
second
whispered
in
his
ear
make
for
the
alley
just
in
front
of
you
to
the
left
to
the
right
and
then
to
the
right
again
there
is
a
door
in
the
high
wall
of
the
garden
you
are
safe
if
you
can
reach
it
it
is
you
they
want
they
will
not
harm
the
baron
rush
for
it
i
will
keep
them
off
as
long
as
i
can
ellerey
whispered
the
same
instructions
to
his
second
and
then
waiting
until
the
crowd
had
fallen
back
for
a
moment
he
suddenly
rushed
forward
using
his
sword
and
his
clenched
fist
to
force
himself
a
passage
the
crowd
was
taken
by
surprise
and
a
cloud
hiding
the
moon
at
that
moment
was
in
ellerey
favor
before
they
understood
his
intention
he
had
reached
the
alley
to
the
right
then
left
then
right
he
shouted
to
his
companion
who
was
running
swiftly
at
his
heels
to
the
door
rose
the
shout
behind
him
and
the
whole
garden
was
full
of
rushing
feet
ellerey
gave
a
cry
of
triumph
as
he
caught
the
latch
of
the
door
and
pulled
it
open
half
turning
to
his
companion
as
he
did
so
had
he
been
an
instant
later
that
exultant
cry
would
have
been
his
last
for
at
that
moment
a
dagger
flashed
down
upon
him
and
only
by
a
quick
spring
aside
did
he
avoid
the
blow
the
man
who
had
followed
him
so
closely
was
not
his
second
before
his
adversary
could
recover
himself
he
struck
him
full
in
the
face
with
the
hilt
of
his
sword
and
sent
him
reeling
back
into
the
arms
of
the
foremost
of
his
companions
the
next
instant
ellerey
had
slammed
the
door
behind
him
and
was
in
a
narrow
lane
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
chapter
x
the
folly
of
a
soldier
it
was
not
until
he
had
run
some
distance
along
the
lane
that
ellerey
stopped
to
listen
and
fully
to
realize
that
his
companion
was
not
beside
him
there
were
no
sounds
of
hurrying
feet
in
pursuit
he
could
not
have
his
enemies
so
completely
in
so
short
a
time
either
they
had
come
no
farther
than
the
door
in
the
wall
or
had
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
perhaps
following
his
companion
with
his
sword
still
in
his
hand
held
ready
for
deadly
work
at
a
moment
notice
he
retraced
his
steps
his
senses
sharp
set
to
detect
the
slightest
sound
or
movement
near
him
heavy
clouds
had
engulfed
the
moon
now
the
darkness
was
extreme
and
the
silence
of
the
night
unbroken
he
went
forward
carefully
the
darkness
might
hold
a
legion
of
foes
and
the
silence
be
a
trap
to
catch
him
ellerey
found
the
door
with
difficulty
indeed
by
chance
for
it
was
cunningly
hidden
whatever
the
danger
he
must
enter
the
garden
again
in
search
for
his
comrade
the
door
was
shut
and
as
he
felt
along
it
from
top
to
bottom
touching
no
latch
nor
handle
nor
keyhole
even
he
realized
that
entrance
that
way
was
barred
the
door
only
opened
from
within
he
had
stepped
back
to
consider
how
and
at
what
point
he
could
best
scale
the
wall
when
a
slight
movement
close
beside
him
caused
him
to
stand
on
the
defensive
in
a
moment
is
that
you
ellerey
you
got
out
then
thank
heaven
yes
i
did
speak
because
i
thought
you
were
one
of
them
and
just
now
i
no
match
for
a
babe
in
arms
he
was
leaning
against
the
wall
a
few
feet
from
the
gate
ellerey
had
supposed
him
farther
off
by
the
faintness
of
his
voice
are
you
hurt
nothing
serious
i
think
but
i
had
a
good
deal
of
blood
let
out
of
me
i
should
have
occupied
that
grave
in
the
garden
for
a
certainty
had
it
not
been
for
the
baron
second
who
stood
over
me
when
i
fell
and
when
the
blackguards
retreated
from
the
door
put
me
outside
this
was
the
baron
doing
perhaps
not
ellerey
answered
can
you
manage
to
walk
yes
if
you
let
me
hang
on
to
you
and
we
do
have
to
go
far
when
i
was
put
outside
something
was
said
about
going
to
the
left
we
go
to
the
left
then
but
i
have
an
idea
where
we
are
the
wounded
man
was
weaker
than
he
imagined
before
they
had
gone
fifty
yards
he
began
to
reel
and
even
as
he
suggested
that
ellerey
should
go
on
and
get
help
he
fainted
ellerey
took
him
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
his
one
idea
was
to
get
as
far
away
from
the
scene
of
the
adventure
as
possible
but
his
progress
was
slow
his
comrade
revived
presently
but
although
he
tried
to
walk
again
the
task
was
beyond
him
so
ellerey
carried
him
resting
at
intervals
all
through
the
night
as
long
as
darkness
lasted
and
they
were
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
they
were
unlikely
to
be
stopped
and
questioned
but
with
dawn
it
would
be
different
ellerey
was
without
his
coat
and
cloak
there
had
been
no
time
to
seize
them
as
he
rushed
from
the
garden
and
he
carried
a
grievously
hurt
man
in
his
arms
the
first
peasant
trudging
to
his
early
toil
who
caught
sight
of
them
would
run
and
tell
the
news
as
he
went
such
publicity
was
to
be
avoided
at
all
costs
or
there
would
be
small
chance
of
his
being
at
the
toison
in
the
bergenstrasse
to
keep
his
appointment
already
a
long
thin
streak
of
gray
showed
low
down
in
the
east
and
ellerey
pressed
forward
as
quickly
as
possible
to
find
an
asylum
he
passed
the
first
scattered
dwellings
he
came
to
having
no
desire
to
knock
up
some
sleepy
peasant
and
have
to
combat
his
inquisitiveness
as
well
as
his
annoyance
at
being
so
unceremoniously
disturbed
presently
where
two
met
he
espied
a
small
habitation
from
which
a
thin
wreath
of
smoke
was
rising
into
the
morning
air
and
decided
to
try
his
fortune
here
he
had
set
his
burden
down
by
the
gate
when
an
old
woman
came
from
the
house
with
a
pail
going
to
a
well
in
the
garden
for
water
good
mother
ellerey
called
out
i
would
claim
your
hospitality
the
woman
turned
to
look
at
him
then
set
down
the
pail
and
came
to
the
gate
what
is
it
defend
us
there
blood
on
him
she
exclaimed
pointing
at
the
prostrate
man
an
attack
in
the
night
by
some
ruffians
who
would
have
murdered
us
good
mother
my
comrade
is
wounded
you
see
will
you
give
him
rest
here
while
i
go
into
the
city
for
help
it
is
ill
work
assisting
strangers
answered
the
woman
look
at
me
is
there
not
honesty
in
my
face
aye
i
quarrel
not
with
your
face
but
there
is
that
on
your
tongue
which
does
not
greatly
please
me
the
accent
of
a
foreigner
asked
ellerey
shall
i
tell
you
a
secret
the
time
is
coming
when
you
shall
have
little
enough
of
such
an
accent
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
for
such
a
prophecy
you
are
welcome
she
answered
opening
the
gate
you
may
come
in
ellerey
carried
his
companion
up
the
garden
path
and
with
the
help
of
the
woman
and
her
grandson
who
stared
in
wonder
at
their
coming
soon
had
him
comfortably
placed
on
a
pallet
in
the
little
room
send
goldberg
to
me
said
his
companion
he
lives
close
to
the
palace
and
is
a
friend
and
discreet
the
mention
of
the
name
caused
ellerey
to
look
closely
at
the
face
for
a
moment
he
had
been
a
true
comrade
and
ellerey
had
given
little
thought
to
his
identity
now
he
wondered
and
a
smile
wrinkled
the
corners
of
his
mouth
his
companion
in
safe
keeping
ellerey
began
actively
to
consider
his
own
affairs
he
knew
goldberg
by
reputation
but
he
had
no
desire
to
visit
him
just
now
to
invent
a
tale
to
satisfy
the
doctor
would
be
difficult
and
might
well
be
left
to
the
wounded
man
he
took
up
his
companion
cloak
he
could
hardly
go
into
the
city
as
he
was
and
then
left
the
room
beckoning
the
woman
to
follow
him
i
will
send
the
doctor
at
once
good
mother
he
said
and
there
is
something
to
help
my
poor
thanks
can
you
give
me
a
piece
of
paper
and
lend
me
a
pencil
the
golden
coins
clinking
in
her
hand
would
have
purchased
a
far
greater
service
the
pencil
and
paper
were
brought
and
ellerey
wrote
rapidly
for
a
few
moments
then
tore
the
paper
in
half
he
folded
each
portion
carefully
placing
one
in
his
pocket
the
other
he
kept
in
his
hand
if
the
lad
would
earn
something
send
him
after
me
quickly
he
said
and
then
he
went
up
the
garden
path
and
took
the
road
to
the
city
in
a
few
moments
the
boy
overtook
him
do
you
know
the
palace
my
lad
yes
to
the
right
of
it
there
is
a
large
square
i
know
it
answered
the
boy
the
foreigners
who
hate
us
live
there
i
would
curb
that
young
tongue
of
yours
or
you
be
using
it
squealing
for
mercy
under
the
whip
ask
there
for
goldberg
house
and
give
him
this
paper
do
you
understand
the
lad
nodded
run
quickly
then
and
afterward
come
to
me
in
the
grande
place
you
know
the
statue
of
king
ferdinand
there
i
shall
be
beside
it
away
with
you
the
quicker
you
do
your
errand
the
greater
your
reward
the
lad
needed
no
second
bidding
he
started
off
at
a
brisk
trot
and
ellerey
pursued
his
way
to
the
city
the
gates
were
open
and
there
were
few
abroad
in
the
streets
as
yet
but
the
thought
of
the
many
hands
which
had
sought
to
despatch
him
in
the
garden
last
night
made
ellerey
proceed
with
greater
caution
than
he
had
ever
exercised
only
a
few
in
the
dim
light
could
have
seen
his
face
sufficiently
to
recognize
him
but
he
drew
the
cloak
up
to
his
chin
and
concealed
his
face
as
much
as
possible
he
avoided
the
larger
thoroughfares
being
undesirous
of
meeting
any
acquaintances
and
in
the
smaller
streets
which
he
traversed
he
might
at
any
moment
come
face
to
face
with
one
of
that
crowd
he
had
so
recently
escaped
from
he
went
warily
therefore
looking
for
the
slightest
glance
of
recognition
in
the
face
of
every
man
he
met
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
grande
place
he
lingered
in
a
side
street
until
he
saw
the
lad
approaching
the
statue
when
he
went
to
meet
him
you
delivered
the
letter
yes
i
was
asked
who
gave
it
me
and
i
said
a
man
i
did
not
know
that
was
true
enough
ellerey
returned
here
for
your
trouble
would
you
earn
more
the
boy
eyes
glistened
as
his
fingers
closed
on
the
silver
it
was
easy
to
buy
faithful
service
in
sturatzberg
so
long
as
no
one
was
near
to
offer
a
higher
price
for
unfaithfulness
ellerey
judged
that
such
a
messenger
as
this
lad
would
pass
unchallenged
and
unnoticed
take
this
to
the
western
gate
and
ask
for
the
lodging
of
a
captain
called
ellerey
he
has
a
servant
named
stefan
give
him
the
paper
he
shall
have
it
there
is
double
payment
then
run
i
shall
know
if
your
errand
is
quickly
done
and
you
if
you
loiter
and
having
watched
the
lad
disappear
ellerey
went
quickly
down
a
side
street
and
by
many
turnings
and
doublings
on
his
track
sought
to
escape
any
spy
who
might
chance
to
be
watching
him
at
dawn
stefan
stretched
out
his
huge
limbs
upon
the
settle
and
awoke
with
a
heavy
grunt
no
matter
how
deep
his
potations
on
the
previous
evening
he
always
awoke
early
not
fresh
perhaps
that
were
too
much
to
expect
but
with
his
wits
clear
sitting
up
he
glanced
round
the
room
for
signs
of
his
master
return
and
seeing
none
grunted
again
in
wonder
a
tankard
was
on
the
floor
beside
him
and
he
drank
the
flat
remains
from
last
night
measure
with
a
wry
face
then
he
pushed
open
the
door
of
his
master
room
and
looked
in
empty
he
said
satisfied
that
his
master
had
not
entered
without
being
heard
here
another
street
quarrel
maybe
and
more
torn
clothes
to
sell
to
the
ragman
then
stefan
made
his
morning
toilet
it
was
a
simple
process
his
ablutions
were
taken
at
irregular
intervals
sometimes
at
long
intervals
and
this
was
not
the
time
for
them
he
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
to
take
some
of
the
tangle
out
of
it
shook
his
great
frame
to
force
his
clothes
into
comfortable
position
tightened
his
loosened
belt
and
took
off
his
boots
for
a
few
moments
he
sat
on
the
settle
his
legs
stretched
out
wide
apart
then
he
drew
his
boots
on
again
and
stamping
himself
firmly
into
them
was
ready
for
whatever
the
day
might
bring
forth
the
street
was
still
silent
and
deserted
as
stefan
went
to
the
door
and
looked
to
right
and
left
the
neighborhood
was
one
of
the
last
in
the
city
to
stir
itself
if
stefan
felt
any
anxiety
regarding
his
master
there
was
no
expression
in
his
face
to
mark
it
he
was
stolid
and
imperturbable
would
have
remained
so
probably
had
ellerey
been
carried
up
the
street
dead
on
a
shutter
he
grunted
now
and
then
walked
half
a
dozen
paces
from
the
door
and
back
to
circulate
his
blood
and
then
leaned
with
his
shoulders
against
the
wall
as
though
he
were
a
fixture
there
until
desperate
necessity
moved
him
the
boy
who
turned
quickly
into
the
street
and
then
came
along
slowly
looking
to
this
side
and
that
hardly
appeared
the
kind
of
visitor
necessary
to
move
the
soldier
stefan
looked
at
him
because
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
street
to
look
at
but
he
was
little
interested
as
the
lad
came
nearer
however
the
soldier
became
aware
that
the
sleepy
street
was
beginning
to
rouse
itself
the
blind
in
a
window
of
the
house
opposite
was
drawn
aside
for
a
moment
and
a
face
looked
out
the
aspect
of
the
morning
seemed
speedily
to
satisfy
for
the
blind
quickly
fell
back
into
its
place
again
without
actually
looking
up
stefan
had
seen
those
peering
eyes
and
curiously
enough
they
had
him
interested
in
the
lad
who
suddenly
stopped
in
front
of
him
can
you
tell
me
where
a
captain
ellerey
lodges
were
you
told
to
go
into
a
street
and
bawl
for
information
like
that
until
you
found
him
asked
the
soldier
gruffly
i
spoke
no
louder
than
i
always
do
answered
the
boy
then
it
a
hale
pair
of
lungs
you
got
concealed
in
that
body
of
yours
i
nigh
deaf
with
your
shouting
come
within
the
doorway
my
lad
and
whisper
perhaps
i
catch
the
meaning
of
your
question
when
it
does
not
drum
through
me
like
the
cry
of
a
drunken
crowd
of
rioters
somewhat
abashed
the
boy
did
as
he
was
told
and
repeated
his
question
in
a
lower
tone
by
a
strange
chance
he
lives
in
this
selfsame
house
but
he
not
abroad
yet
said
stefan
we
do

message

he
of
a
delicate
constitution
this
stefan
i
know

i

he
the
boy
looked
doubtful
for
a
moment
is
that
truth
i
like
your
caution
stefan

you

whether

men
or
women
though
the
women
will
bring
out
all
your
mettle
i
warrant
yes
truth
i
am
stefan
i
was
to
give
this
paper
to
you
the
soldier
opened
it
and
read
it
not
without
some
difficulty
it
seemed
who
gave
you
this
a
man
i
know
no
more
of
him
good
which
way
lies
your
home
on
the
road
toward
breslen
good
again
get
you
home
quickly
and
look
you
my
lad
should
any
ask
what
errand
you
have
been
on
this
morning
be
a
fool
and
forget
if
your
memory
too
good
it
like
enough
some
friend
of
mine
will
be
spoiling
those
fine
lungs
of
yours
hast
ever
heard
a
man
try
to
shout
with
a
sword
thrust
through
him
no
sir
i
have
stefan
answered
it
a
fearsome
sound
like
a
whisper
bubbling
up
through
water
i
be
sorry
to
hear
it
from
you
off
with
you
stefan
watched
the
boy
out
of
the
street
then
he
went
in
and
striking
a
match
burnt
the
paper
scattering
the
charred
fragments
on
the
hearth
here
news
that
an
excuse
for
wine
he
said
pouring
out
a
liberal
draught
into
the
tankard
a
man
gets
rusty
as
an
old
lock
with
waiting
this
will
grease
the
action
somewhat
it
early
hours
for
such
refreshment
said
a
voice
at
the
door
stefan
winked
one
eye
over
the
rim
of
the
tankard
at
the
intruder
but
did
not
pause
in
his
drinking
until
three
parts
of
the
liquid
was
gone
then
he
drew
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
beard
and
mustache
and
sighed
with
satisfaction
never
too
early
to
drink
thanks
for
good
tidings
monsieur
francois
the
frenchman
with
a
quick
glance
round
the
room
stepped
in
a
smile
upon
his
lips
he
had
told
his
master
more
than
once
that
this
servant
of
captain
ellerey
was
a
drunkard
and
a
fool
and
that
little
was
to
be
got
out
of
him
because
nothing
was
ever
trusted
to
him
and
what
are
the
good
tidings
he
asked
you
be
laughing
at
me
because
you
do
understand
my
disease
monsieur
francois
i
hate
women
hate
them
then
is
your
disease
very
lamentable
well
there
it
is
i
hate
them
said
stefan
but
there
was
one
woman
who
would
not
hate
me
do
what
i
would
she
was
a
bonny
wench
so
far
as
i
am
a
judge
of
bigger
girth
than
most
you
meet
and
with
an
arm
of
muscle
to
appeal
to
a
soldier
like
me
at
the
street
corner
wait
awhile
to
see
me
pass
and
she
remark
on
the
cut
of
my
features
and
the
stalwart
looks
of
these
legs
of
mine
i
took
no
notice
but
her
love
was
proof
against
a
trifle
of
that
kind
she
a
husband
of
me
some
day
she
said
and
those
that
heard
her
told
me
the
saying
there
a
vein
of
superstition
in
my
composition
and
for
months
past
i
been
expecting
her
to
keep
her
word
when
a
woman
set
upon
a
matter
where
the
hole
a
man
may
find
safety
in
tell
me
that
monsieur
francois
the
frenchman
shrugged
his
shoulders
thinking
what
a
fool
his
companion
was
this
morning
there
comes
a
lad
looking
up
and
down
the
street
to
find
me
and
he
says
to
me
lives
stefan
he
who
is
servant
to
that
captain
ellerey
we
hear
so
much
about
and
i
answers
cunningly
knowing
the
value
of
caution
in
such
times
as
these
at
last
i
admit
that
i
am
and
he
says
a
fat
woman
that
what
he
called
her
monsieur
francois
a
fat
woman
you
afraid
of
because
going
to
marry
you
i
sweated
from
every
hole
in
my
skin
thinking
the
time
had
come
then
says
he
need
be
afraid
any
more
she
was
married
yesterday
to
a
from
breslen
way
and
tame
her
fast
enough
like
you
might
a
hungry
sparrow
in
winter
time
good
tidings
monsieur
francois
believe
me
though
i
doubt
the
taming
and
pity
the
woodcutter
why
the
muscles
in
her
arm
would
blush
to
be
seen
by
the
side
of
mine
and
a
woodcutter
would
have
to
cut
deep
into
the
forest
before
muscles
stood
out
like
these
and
with
a
great
laugh
stefan
bared
his
brawny
arms
for
the
inspection
very
beautiful
said
francois
i
believe
you
too
good
to
waste
in
fondling
a
woman
ugh
what
brings
you
so
early
to
the
western
gate
i
have
a
message
for
the
captain
ah
from
monsieur
de
froilette
i
only
carry
messages
for
my
master
i
deliver
it
tell
me
quickly
and
you
shall
taste
a
drop
of
real
burgundy
to
keep
the
morning
air
out
of
your
return
journey
i
was
to
tell
it
to
the
captain
personally
what
thundered
stefan
am
i
not
to
be
trusted
then
you
know
the
value
of
caution
in
these
times
said
francois
you
spoke
of
it
just
now
monsieur
de
froilette
is
stefan
that
is
the
truth
it
is
a
weakness
of
all
masters
the
soldier
replied
and
so
they
overreach
themselves
give
me
a
little
confidence
and
i
am
content
but
distrust
me
and
my
ears
are
ever
on
the
stretch
to
catch
news
which
i
may
use
to
my
advantage
but
i
have
no
quarrel
with
you
the
captain
is
out
you
must
await
his
return
and
while
you
wait
you
shall
taste
his
burgundy
out
so
early
oh
he
in
love
i
think
for
he
walks
under
the
stars
often
and
on
his
return
sighs
like
a
gathering
storm
i
hear
things
monsieur
francois
i
know
the
wily
frenchman
nodded
sympathetically
perhaps
i
might
find
a
market
for
what
you
know
that
been
in
my
mind
these
many
days
stefan
answered
it
the
first
word
that
sticks
in
my
throat
i
never
let
out
secrets
before
maybe
because
no
man
has
told
me
any
come
the
wine
may
loosen
my
tongue
he
took
two
tankards
and
a
key
from
the
shelf
and
led
the
way
along
a
passage
the
frenchman
followed
eagerly
laughing
at
his
simplicity
it
would
be
strange
if
stefan
could
not
tell
him
some
news
which
would
be
useful
to
monsieur
de
froilette
you
have
your
wine
in
safe
keeping
he
said
as
stefan
went
down
into
a
cellar
bidding
francois
to
wait
until
he
had
struck
a
light
would
you
have
us
keep
it
in
the
doorway
for
every
thirsty
throat
in
sturatzberg
come
down
now
sit
you
on
that
empty
barrel
there
wine
should
make
you
dream
to
your
heart
content
the
captain
will
think
that
it
has
leaked
somewhat
scurvy
treatment
monsieur
francois
to
have
such
wine
in
hiding
and
never
ask
a
soldier
comrade
to
pass
an
opinion
so
we
help
ourselves
to
his
wine
and
to
his
secrets
eh
stefan
drowned
his
loud
laughter
in
a
copious
draught
while
francois
sipped
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
fit
for
a
king
palate
he
murmured
say
rather
for
the
gods
nectar
monsieur
nectar
my
secrets
bubble
to
my
tongue
as
the
wine
bubbles
to
the
surface
turn
them
into
good
money
stefan
after
all
what
is
this
english
captain
to
you
the
soldier
set
down
his
tankard
and
lowered
his
voice
into
a
confidential
whisper
there
are
some
who
take
me
for
a
fool
he
said
coming
nearer
to
his
companion
the
captain
did
not
return
last
night
and
there
have
been
watchers
in
the
street
watchers
go
on
stefan
what
else
said
the
frenchman
eagerly
aye
i
saw
one
draw
back
a
blind
in
the
house
opposite
not
an
hour
ago
what
do
you
make
of
that
monsieur
francois
the
answer
was
a
smothered
gurgle
for
a
cloth
had
been
suddenly
tied
across
the
frenchman
mouth
it
was
in
vain
that
he
tried
to
free
himself
he
was
no
match
against
the
muscles
stefan
had
shown
him
a
little
while
ago
and
before
he
had
fully
realized
what
had
happened
he
was
bound
gagged
and
lying
on
his
back
on
the
floor
you
have
ample
time
to
find
out
how
much
of
a
fool
i
am
monsieur
francois
said
stefan
for
unless
a
miracle
should
happen
you
be
sharp
set
for
a
meal
before
you
leave
here
never
look
so
solemn
man
you
wo
die
i
send
and
release
you
as
soon
as
it
is
safe
to
do
so
and
if
it
will
save
your
character
i
let
your
master
in
the
altstrasse
know
that
you
did
your
best
to
carry
out
his
instructions
and
make
a
fool
of
me
should
you
be
able
to
drag
yourself
about
presently
you
have
my
full
permission
to
hold
your
mouth
under
any
tap
there
in
the
cellar
and
we
never
ask
for
payment
of
the
score
and
drinking
the
wine
which
remained
in
his
own
tankard
and
also
in
the
frenchman
he
left
the
cellar
locking
the
door
after
him
a
few
minutes
later
he
walked
down
the
street
with
a
smile
a
bundle
under
his
arm
and
was
soon
lost
to
view
in
the
lower
purlieus
of
the
city
that
night
seven
horsemen
left
sturatzberg
riding
singly
and
not
all
by
the
same
gate
but
by
whichever
gate
they
left
they
halted
when
they
had
ridden
out
of
sight
and
turned
aside
to
reach
the
breslen
road
the
last
to
go
was
stefan
he
went
by
the
southern
gate
and
once
free
of
the
city
urged
his
horse
forward
toward
the
forest
which
lies
between
breslen
and
sturatzberg
chapter
xl
in
the
bois
the
bois
lay
without
the
northern
gate
the
work
of
planting
gardens
and
cutting
carriage
roads
through
the
nearer
stretches
of
the
forest
which
touched
the
city
on
this
side
was
due
to
ferdinand
i
whose
statue
stood
in
the
grande
place
the
only
useful
action
of
which
he
had
ever
been
guilty
it
was
said
early
in
the
morning
men
riding
in
the
bois
had
inquired
of
one
another
whether
the
story
concerning
baron
petrescu
were
true
one
had
heard
this
another
that
it
was
whispered
that
the
baron
had
been
killed
in
a
duel
by
a
member
of
the
british
embassy
who
had
also
been
seriously
wounded
and
again
that
he
had
wounded
his
adversary
and
had
then
been
nearly
killed
by
his
adversary
partisans
then
one
man
inquired
the
name
of
the
woman
and
another
where
the
duel
had
been
fought
for
there
was
a
law
against
duelling
although
it
was
seldom
enforced
the
true
story
did
not
become
public
property
but
it
was
presently
known
that
the
baron
wound
was
a
slight
affair
after
all
and
that
the
duel
had
not
been
fought
with
a
member
of
the
embassy
captain
ward
had
certainly
been
injured
but
that
was
the
result
of
an
accident
they
had
goldberg
word
for
it
it
was
then
that
the
younger
wiseacres
smiled
baron
petrescu
was
an
easy
lover
and
had
been
punished
for
some
indiscretion
some
townsman
perhaps
with
the
luck
on
his
side
had
got
the
better
of
the
master
of
fence
no
wonder
the
baron
wished
to
keep
the
matter
quiet
lord
cloverton
knew
the
true
story
captain
ward
had
sent
to
him
directly
goldberg
had
got
him
home
and
the
ambassador
shut
himself
in
his
room
to
consider
his
course
of
action
after
his
failure
to
entrap
queen
elena
last
night
and
the
king
anger
consequent
upon
his
accusation
his
position
was
an
extremely
difficult
one
the
queen
had
outwitted
him
but
the
fact
remained
that
captain
ellerey
was
not
to
be
found
at
his
lodging
this
morning
he
had
ascertained
this
fact
there
was
no
doubt
that
ellerey
had
some
understanding
with
her
majesty
and
might
have
already
left
the
city
on
his
mission
the
token
might
have
been
changed
at
the
last
moment
he
had
failed
to
arouse
the
king
suspicion
through
the
queen
but
the
interests
at
stake
demanded
instant
action
and
another
method
must
be
used
so
lord
cloverton
went
to
the
king
and
again
apologized
for
the
mistake
his
zeal
had
led
him
into
her
majesty
had
of
course
proved
how
innocent
her
audience
with
captain
ellerey
had
been
but
the
fact
remained
that
ellerey
was
the
moving
spirit
in
a
rebellion
the
sooner
means
were
taken
to
obtain
possession
of
his
person
the
better
in
this
manner
the
ambassador
quickly
made
his
peace
and
messengers
galloped
hastily
through
the
city
from
the
palace
the
night
had
been
a
sleepless
one
for
frina
mavrodin
from
the
moment
she
had
seen
those
figures
descending
the
stairs
her
thoughts
had
been
fixed
in
one
channel
she
knew
the
baron
reputation
as
a
swordsman
and
her
heart
went
with
the
man
who
had
met
his
insult
with
so
swift
a
demand
for
retribution
the
cause
to
which
she
was
attached
for
which
she
was
prepared
to
squander
her
wealth
to
give
her
life
even
were
that
necessary
had
compelled
her
companionship
with
this
adventurous
englishman
she
had
met
him
in
a
spirit
of
raillery
measuring
her
woman
wit
and
beauty
against
his
brusqueness
and
his
resourcefulness
and
calm
determination
had
won
her
admiration
the
cause
was
altogether
forgotten
sometimes
in
the
mere
pleasure
she
had
in
being
with
him
he
was
not
as
other
men
quick
with
a
compliment
ever
ready
to
please
not
a
word
of
love
had
he
spoken
to
her
yet
his
eyes
had
always
sought
her
first
in
the
throng
whether
it
were
in
the
bois
or
at
court
and
having
found
her
he
looked
no
further
if
she
indulged
in
dreams
sometimes
they
were
shadowy
visions
pleasant
enough
but
taking
no
distinct
shape
demanding
no
definite
consideration
the
awakening
had
come
when
princess
maritza
had
spoken
of
him
she
had
said
little
but
frina
had
read
the
deeper
meaning
underneath
her
words
as
a
princess
maritza
had
watched
the
man
career
believing
that
one
day
he
might
prove
useful
to
her
cause
but
as
a
woman
she
had
also
remembered
the
circumstances
of
their
meeting
and
had
treasured
them
in
her
heart
only
with
this
discovery
had
frina
mavrodin
become
fully
conscious
of
all
captain
ellerey
companionship
meant
to
her
the
were
suddenly
opened
and
the
rushing
torrent
of
her
emotions
threatened
to
sweep
away
all
thought
of
the
cause
she
had
worked
for
and
loved
and
believed
in
almost
had
she
told
him
her
secret
by
her
eager
questions
and
the
blood
mounted
to
her
cheeks
as
she
remembered
how
would
he
have
answered
her
had
he
not
been
summoned
to
audience
with
the
queen
leaning
at
the
open
window
looking
at
the
heavy
clouds
which
presently
obscured
the
moon
she
passed
a
night
of
restless
anxiety
somewhere
perhaps
very
near
her
the
man
she
loved
had
faced
death
calmly
fearlessly
even
now
he
might
be
lying
with
sightless
eyes
toward
the
coming
day
the
new
day
which
was
so
long
in
coming
it
came
at
last
and
with
her
eyes
bathed
to
remove
all
traces
of
the
night
vigil
she
went
as
usual
to
breakfast
with
the
princess
who
was
always
an
early
riser
since
the
night
they
had
spoken
of
captain
ellerey
there
had
arisen
a
subtle
difference
in
their
relations
toward
each
other
it
hardly
amounted
to
restraint
but
the
countess
was
more
reserved
and
the
princess
talked
little
of
her
hopes
and
plans
she
made
more
show
of
taking
her
companion
into
her
confidence
but
told
her
less
for
this
difference
perhaps
frina
was
chiefly
responsible
maritza
felt
that
she
had
grown
lukewarm
not
to
her
personally
but
toward
the
cause
which
took
so
few
and
such
trifling
steps
toward
its
end
she
did
not
wonder
at
it
no
day
passed
in
which
she
herself
had
not
a
period
of
despair
a
passionate
longing
to
drive
things
to
a
speedy
conclusion
though
the
end
brought
failure
to
her
her
cause
was
paramount
and
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
think
of
desmond
ellerey
apart
from
it
yet
when
frina
had
in
a
manner
claimed
him
she
remembered
that
morning
on
the
downs
every
hue
of
land
and
sky
every
sound
that
had
sung
in
her
ears
every
perfume
the
air
held
and
the
centre
of
all
was
this
man
who
seemed
then
to
be
her
possession
he
had
come
to
her
country
not
at
her
bidding
perhaps
but
at
her
suggestion
surely
and
she
had
a
right
to
his
allegiance
it
was
a
woman
argument
and
a
weak
one
yet
her
heart
seemed
to
excuse
her
they
were
still
at
breakfast
when
dumitru
was
ushered
in
pardon
princess
but
i
have
news
important
news
it
could
not
wait
you
are
welcome
good
dumitru
does
the
news
mean
action
such
is
the
only
news
i
long
for
now
yes
was
the
answer
this
english
captain
is
about
to
move
whether
he
has
the
token
or
not
i
do
not
know
but
baron
petrescu
believes
he
has
last
night
he
picked
a
quarrel
with
him
and
they
fought
and
fool
that
he
is
exclaimed
the
princess
starting
from
her
seat
does
not
the
baron
know
that
i
had
work
for
this
englishman
and
now
he
has
killed
or
maimed
him
in
a
useless
quarrel
but
it
was
not
so
princess
it
was
the
baron
who
fell
frina
mavrodin
had
also
risen
from
the
table
her
hands
clasped
firmly
together
in
her
excitement
and
a
little
sigh
of
relief
echoed
words
a
new
experience
for
baron
petrescu
she
said
calmly
ah
countess
this
englishman
is
a
devil
the
man
went
on
rapidly
i
had
it
from
one
who
watched
the
fight
there
was
little
moon
and
the
light
was
dancing
and
treacherous
the
baron
used
all
the
art
which
before
has
brought
death
when
he
willed
but
this
english
captain
cared
not
he
knew
all
the
baron
art
and
besides
something
which
the
baron
knew
not
the
baron
would
have
been
killed
had
not
those
who
were
watching
saved
him
they
interfered
said
the
princess
yes
to
save
the
baron
they
did
not
stop
at
that
said
the
countess
eagerly
tell
me
what
happened
have
i
not
said
he
is
a
devil
answered
dumitru
they
rushed
upon
him
and
he
fought
them
all
a
sword
thrust
here
a
blow
with
his
fist
there
a
savage
breaking
through
them
and
he
escaped
unhurt
splendid
exclaimed
frina
her
face
aglow
splendid
frina
is
not
the
baron
our
friend
yet
there
was
a
glow
in
maritza
eyes
too
and
is
not
captain
ellerey
the
man
you
have
work
for
you
should
rejoice
the
princess
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
she
smiled
yes
it
was
splendid
as
you
say
what
more
dumitru
the
friend
of
the
englishman
was
killed
i
think
he
was
of
the
embassy
there
will
be
much
questioning
over
the
affair
the
baron
folly
is
likely
to
ruin
us
said
the
princess
there
is
still
captain
ellerey
said
frina
dumitru
looked
at
the
princess
the
slightest
flicker
in
his
eyes
attracting
her
attention
i
am
not
sure
the
other
man
is
dead
he
said
might
i
suggest
that
the
countess
should
drive
as
usual
and
hear
what
is
said
in
the
bois
then
we
can
plan
and
arrange
the
time
has
surely
come
will
you
frina
i
will
and
you
may
rest
assured
that
i
will
have
the
whole
story
by
when
she
had
left
the
room
princess
maritza
turned
hastily
what
more
dumitru
much
more
princess
but
it
is
only
for
your
ears
frina
mavrodin
had
sped
along
the
corridor
so
swiftly
that
she
did
not
hear
the
door
locked
after
her
to
prevent
her
sudden
return
or
the
intrusion
of
others
for
a
while
she
had
no
thought
but
a
satisfaction
that
baron
petrescu
had
justly
suffered
for
his
unprovoked
insult
but
this
was
succeeded
by
fears
for
ellerey
safety
he
had
escaped
last
night
but
he
had
other
enemies
besides
those
who
had
attempted
to
assassinate
him
in
the
dangerous
enemies
perhaps
she
determined
to
know
nothing
to
school
her
face
to
indifference
while
she
eagerly
learned
all
she
could
she
lunched
with
a
friend
the
wife
of
a
member
of
the
austrian
embassy
who
had
often
quite
unconsciously
given
her
valuable
information
but
she
could
add
nothing
to
her
knowledge
she
knew
baron
petrescu
had
fought
a
duel
and
had
been
wounded
but
she
did
not
know
who
his
opponent
was
later
in
the
bois
frina
heard
many
versions
of
the
story
but
not
in
one
of
them
was
captain
ellerey
name
mentioned
she
did
not
understand
it
there
was
some
undercurrent
of
intrigue
going
on
of
which
she
was
ignorant
her
carriage
was
drawn
up
to
the
side
of
the
road
where
she
was
holding
a
small
court
of
pedestrians
when
she
caught
sight
of
lord
cloverton
it
was
seldom
that
he
walked
in
the
bois
but
that
he
should
be
there
in
confidential
colloquy
with
monsieur
de
froilette
was
nothing
short
of
marvellous
lord
cloverton
saw
the
countess
and
stopped
a
little
distance
away
he
wanted
to
speak
to
her
but
had
no
desire
that
de
froilette
should
be
a
third
at
the
interview
i
am
exceedingly
obliged
to
you
monsieur
he
said
to
his
companion
any
information
respecting
captain
ellerey
whereabouts
just
now
will
be
of
immense
advantage
to
me
that
is
to
the
country
he
is
one
of
those
reckless
young
men
who
while
winning
our
admiration
do
not
blind
us
to
the
fact
that
they
are
dangerous
ah
i
have
admired
him
and
seen
the
danger
for
a
long
time
de
froilette
answered
the
commercial
interests
i
have
in
this
country
force
me
to
keep
pace
with
its
politics
i
am
not
an
expert
and
it
is
sometimes
very
difficult
i
can
quite
believe
it
said
the
ambassador
looking
however
wonderfully
incredulous
i
do
not
fancy
i
have
ever
heard
in
which
direction
your
commercial
interests
lie
timber
my
lord
a
profitable
business
i
hope
so
in
the
future
at
present
there
is
too
much
unrest
with
the
princess
maritza
in
sturatzberg
in
that
i
think
you
are
mistaken
monsieur
no
my
lord
mine
was
trusted
information
through
the
same
channel
i
shall
learn
where
captain
ellerey
is
a
spy
monsieur
he
would
be
hurt
to
hear
himself
called
so
he
is
a
servant
of
mine
interested
in
my
business
and
a
valuable
fellow
he
has
known
captain
ellerey
movements
for
months
past
and
even
now
i
warrant
is
at
his
heels
you
shall
hear
from
me
my
lord
the
moment
he
returns
a
thousand
thanks
monsieur
you
will
place
me
under
an
obligation
and
the
value
of
the
news
will
depend
on
the
state
of
the
timber
trade
he
added
to
himself
as
he
turned
away
something
has
frightened
monsieur
de
froilette
i
wonder
what
it
is
joining
the
little
crowd
round
the
countess
mavrodin
he
entered
into
the
conversation
with
the
heartiness
of
a
man
who
has
a
care
in
the
world
and
one
by
one
the
others
withdrew
it
was
so
evident
that
the
ambassador
intended
to
remain
frina
mavrodin
desired
nothing
better
lord
cloverton
could
doubtless
tell
her
the
truth
and
although
she
did
not
for
one
moment
expect
him
to
do
so
she
thought
she
could
probably
draw
it
from
him
with
the
help
of
the
knowledge
she
already
possessed
my
horses
are
getting
rather
restive
they
have
been
standing
so
long
will
you
drive
with
me
lord
cloverton
he
thanked
her
and
got
in
beside
her
one
seldom
sees
you
in
the
bois
she
said
no
i
will
be
honest
i
sometimes
sleep
in
the
afternoon
countess
and
she
queried
with
a
laugh
business
brought
me
i
hoped
to
see
you
surely
you
flatter
me
since
when
have
you
considered
me
capable
of
being
i
am
all
seriousness
countess
politics
in
sturatzberg
are
as
dried
wood
stacked
ready
for
burning
and
a
torch
is
already
in
the
midst
of
it
until
now
the
torch
has
been
moved
hither
and
thither
giving
the
wood
no
time
to
catch
but
now
i
fear
the
flame
is
held
steadily
i
seem
to
hear
the
first
sounds
of
the
crackling
i
seem
to
have
heard
the
beginning
often
she
answered
but
a
swift
hand
has
always
saved
the
situation
the
danger
has
never
been
so
imminent
as
it
is
now
countess
are
you
not
still
in
sturatzberg
to
cope
with
the
danger
she
asked
turning
to
him
with
a
radiant
smile
i
stand
alone
countess
what
can
one
man
do
i
wonder
whether
you
can
credit
me
with
disinterestedness
whether
you
can
believe
that
i
have
the
welfare
of
this
country
at
heart
while
carrying
out
the
policy
of
my
own
is
not
that
the
position
of
every
ambassador
nominally
perhaps
i
was
asking
you
to
believe
something
more
definite
in
my
case
he
returned
do
i
ask
too
much
in
a
measure
you
and
i
are
drawn
together
in
this
crisis
we
should
be
allies
are
my
poor
wits
of
service
either
way
a
woman
is
always
a
valuable
ally
and
the
countess
mavrodin
knows
her
power
no
i
am
beyond
turning
pretty
speeches
he
went
on
quickly
the
times
are
too
serious
for
them
you
know
countess
what
occurred
last
night
i
left
the
palace
somewhat
early
she
said
but
there
was
an
air
of
constraint
about
what
caused
it
lord
cloverton
i
was
referring
to
baron
petrescu
affair
no
one
has
talked
of
anything
else
and
you
can
tell
me
the
truth
of
it
she
exclaimed
i
am
glad
i
have
heard
many
stories
since
i
entered
the
bois
i
was
expecting
to
hear
the
real
truth
from
you
said
the
ambassador
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
from
me
am
i
the
wife
of
some
in
the
city
to
inflame
the
baron
susceptibilities
into
indiscretion
it
is
some
such
tale
i
have
heard
but
which
you
knew
to
be
untrue
countess
i
have
thought
more
highly
of
baron
petrescu
than
that
i
admit
naturally
seeing
that
captain
ellerey
is
not
a
of
the
city
and
has
no
wife
as
far
as
i
know
my
young
countryman
is
no
boaster
beyond
his
worth
it
would
seem
the
baron
has
found
his
match
is
that
the
truth
of
it
she
asked
innocently
i
congratulate
you
upon
your
champion
returned
the
ambassador
you
look
surprised
countess
but
in
the
inner
circle
of
such
a
court
as
we
have
here
in
sturatzberg
such
secrets
will
find
a
tongue
you
have
changed
your
serious
mood
my
lord
it
appears
and
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
pleasantry
believe
me
countess
i
was
never
more
serious
something
of
the
baron
political
leanings
are
known
to
his
majesty
and
the
affair
has
assumed
a
political
significance
in
his
eyes
the
law
has
lain
dormant
it
is
true
but
duelling
is
an
offence
against
the
crown
and
the
king
has
seen
fit
to
set
the
law
in
motion
captain
ellerey
is
sought
for
in
sturatzberg
i
would
do
my
countryman
and
you
a
service
if
i
could
how
am
i
concerned
i
may
thank
you
for
your
courtesy
if
you
will
tell
me
that
is
it
not
true
that
you
were
the
cause
of
this
quarrel
it
is
absolutely
false
stay
countess
it
may
be
that
you
are
unaware
of
the
fact
but
i
have
the
best
reason
for
knowing
that
such
is
the
case
captain
ellerey
had
no
cause
to
draw
sword
on
my
behalf
lord
cloverton
neither
of
his
own
wish
nor
at
my
bidding
did
he
do
it
strange
mused
the
ambassador
it
is
evident
that
he
thought
of
only
one
person
last
night
he
left
instructions
with
his
second
that
you
were
to
be
immediately
informed
if
any
harm
befell
him
he
left
no
other
message
or
remembrance
to
anyone
she
was
not
sufficient
mistress
of
herself
to
prevent
the
ambassador
noting
that
the
information
was
pleasant
to
her
it
may
have
been
presumption
on
his
part
he
went
on
slowly
still
such
thought
can
hardly
be
without
some
interest
for
you
no
doubt
you
would
render
him
a
service
if
you
could
my
friendship
would
prompt
me
to
do
so
then
urge
him
countess
to
withdraw
from
sturatzberg
the
torch
now
put
to
the
dried
wood
is
in
his
hand
what
is
he
to
me
nothing
but
i
would
save
him
if
i
could
what
he
is
to
you
i
do
not
know
i
am
not
skilled
with
women
but
for
your
country
sake
urge
his
departure
it
must
be
done
promptly
for
i
warn
you
the
fire
has
already
caught
hold
and
not
all
even
now
shall
escape
the
burning
your
appeal
to
my
patriotism
might
stir
me
lord
cloverton
did
i
know
where
to
find
captain
ellerey
in
that
countess
i
can
not
help
you
i
had
hoped
you
would
know
have
i
your
permission
to
stop
the
carriage
she
inclined
her
head
they
had
returned
close
to
the
spot
from
which
they
had
started
there
were
fewer
carriages
in
the
bois
and
hardly
any
pedestrians
now
lord
cloverton
had
however
seen
a
man
standing
close
to
the
roadway
and
he
beckoned
him
to
the
carriage
what
news
he
asked
sharply
every
gate
is
closely
watched
my
lord
by
the
king
orders
captain
ellerey
is
to
be
stopped
if
he
attempts
to
leave
the
city
i
fear
we
are
too
late
to
render
any
service
said
the
ambassador
turning
to
the
countess
it
is
a
pity
the
hand
that
holds
the
torch
can
hardly
escape
it
is
not
thought
that
the
captain
has
already
left
but
all
efforts
to
find
him
have
failed
said
the
man
and
then
at
a
sign
from
lord
cloverton
he
withdrew
i
believe
we
are
allies
at
heart
countess
it
is
a
pity
we
have
no
power
to
act
perhaps
you
exaggerate
the
danger
i
fear
not
he
answered
as
he
stepped
from
the
carriage
i
foresee
evil
days
for
sturatzberg
countess
if
i
can
save
the
situation
it
must
be
by
the
sacrifice
of
my
countryman
i
fear
it
is
a
pity
he
stood
bareheaded
until
the
carriage
had
driven
away
and
then
went
quickly
toward
the
embassy
if
frina
mavrodin
knew
where
captain
ellerey
was
as
lord
cloverton
was
convinced
she
did
she
would
warn
him
whatever
interests
ellerey
had
at
heart
he
would
not
chance
disaster
by
attempting
to
leave
the
city
until
the
watch
upon
the
gates
was
relaxed
to
some
extent
there
must
therefore
be
delay
in
whatever
plot
was
in
hand
and
a
few
days
now
were
of
priceless
value
politics
had
little
place
in
frina
mavrodin
thoughts
as
she
drove
homeward
through
the
city
she
had
denied
that
desmond
ellerey
had
drawn
sword
in
her
cause
and
yet
might
he
not
have
done
so
after
all
what
she
had
seen
might
only
have
been
the
end
of
a
quarrel
baron
petrescu
may
have
spoken
some
light
word
concerning
her
which
ellerey
had
resented
if
lord
cloverton
had
spoken
the
truth
ellerey
last
thought
had
been
of
her
she
was
quite
content
that
her
fair
fame
should
rest
in
his
keeping
now
he
was
in
danger
whatever
lord
cloverton
aims
might
be
one
thing
was
certain
the
city
gates
were
closed
against
ellerey
departure
without
warning
he
would
almost
certainly
be
taken
how
could
she
help
him
there
was
confusion
at
her
door
when
the
carriage
stopped
servants
were
in
the
hall
expectantly
awaiting
her
what
is
it
she
asked
in
your
absence
countess
we
were
powerless
answered
her
pale
even
now
with
indignation
the
order
was
imperative
what
order
the
order
to
search
the
house
the
countess
started
but
was
again
in
a
moment
not
all
her
servants
knew
of
the
identity
of
the
princess
for
whom
were
they
looking
for
an
english
captain
named
ellerey
was
the
answer
i
said
that
no
such
person
visited
here
at
any
time
but
they
would
not
believe
me
and
searched
the
whole
house
and
found
no
one
countess
the
man
was
wise
he
said
no
more
before
the
other
servants
i
will
complain
to
his
majesty
frina
answered
and
then
she
went
quickly
to
the
apartments
occupied
by
the
princess
maritza
hannah
met
her
on
the
threshold
has
she
not
returned
my
lady
where
is
she
how
did
she
have
warning
asked
frina
she
had
gone
long
before
she
went
without
a
word
to
me
when
they
came
asking
for
some
englishman
i
had
just
wit
enough
to
answer
that
i
was
your
ladyship
servant
and
knew
no
englishman
but
it
was
hard
work
not
to
ask
them
what
had
become
of
my
princess
and
dumitru
gone
gone
i
always
took
him
for
a
with
that
naked
knife
hidden
in
his
shirt
i
believe
he
has
made
away
with
her
peace
woman
say
nothing
a
word
may
ruin
her
you
can
go
but
my
lady
you
can
go
i
say
there
was
a
tone
in
the
command
that
brooked
no
disobedience
the
woman
left
the
room
hastily
leaving
the
countess
alone
alone
a
wild
rush
of
thoughts
overwhelmed
her
the
hope
and
joy
that
had
budded
in
her
heart
were
suddenly
blighted
the
world
seemed
to
slip
away
from
her
leaving
her
alone
indeed
chapter
xii
grigosie
the
toison
was
an
ancient
inn
standing
back
from
the
bergenstrasse
and
reached
by
a
narrow
court
it
did
not
advertise
itself
was
not
easily
found
and
its
frequenters
were
few
those
who
used
it
seemed
to
use
it
often
for
the
landlord
welcomed
them
like
old
friends
they
were
of
the
poorer
sort
and
the
want
of
comfort
in
the
place
did
not
disturb
them
perhaps
the
quality
of
the
liquor
made
amends
it
presented
a
narrow
front
to
the
court
the
great
walls
on
either
side
appeared
to
have
squeezed
it
the
two
little
windows
above
the
signboard
flat
against
the
wall
and
the
single
door
rather
suggested
a
face
and
the
door
out
of
the
perpendicular
looked
strangely
like
a
mouth
awry
uttering
a
cry
of
pain
the
building
was
deep
however
and
there
was
a
long
narrow
room
at
the
rear
of
which
all
the
frequenters
of
the
place
were
not
aware
this
room
even
in
broad
daylight
was
dim
and
it
grew
dark
there
early
it
was
still
light
in
the
wider
streets
of
the
city
but
in
this
room
a
candle
was
burning
on
the
corner
of
a
table
beside
which
a
man
sat
he
had
pushed
back
the
remains
of
a
meal
and
his
fingers
played
reflectively
with
the
tankard
which
the
landlord
had
replenished
a
few
moments
before
the
landlord
had
asked
no
questions
had
attempted
no
conversation
when
desmond
ellerey
had
entered
and
called
for
liquor
he
had
made
a
sign
to
the
landlord
as
he
had
been
instructed
and
which
was
perfectly
understood
two
men
were
drinking
in
the
doorway
at
the
time
and
when
they
had
gone
the
landlord
led
ellerey
to
the
long
room
there
will
be
inquiries
for
me
landlord
whoever
gives
the
sign
bring
him
in
at
once
but
no
one
else
mind
the
landlord
nodded
let
me
have
food
and
drink
i
care
not
what
so
there
is
plenty
of
it
i
have
not
broken
fast
since
yesterday
throwing
aside
one
cloak
which
he
carried
over
his
arm
and
loosening
the
one
he
wore
ellerey
disclosed
the
fact
that
he
was
well
armed
and
booted
and
spurred
for
a
journey
earlier
in
the
day
stefan
had
met
him
at
a
tavern
in
the
city
bringing
these
clothes
with
him
as
directed
in
the
note
which
the
boy
had
delivered
the
remains
of
the
court
uniform
which
he
had
worn
last
night
had
been
hidden
away
and
there
was
nothing
now
in
ellerey
dress
to
mark
him
as
a
officer
he
had
already
waited
three
hours
or
more
and
began
to
grow
impatient
the
men
who
had
been
chosen
for
this
desperate
service
were
already
on
their
way
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
and
men
of
this
description
were
wont
to
fret
at
delay
and
inactivity
he
wanted
to
be
away
himself
and
until
he
had
the
queen
token
safely
in
his
possession
he
could
not
put
aside
his
fears
that
it
would
not
come
that
something
had
happened
to
prevent
her
sending
it
the
king
sudden
interruption
last
night
might
have
forced
her
to
change
her
plans
might
possibly
have
caused
her
to
sacrifice
him
to
save
herself
at
the
best
delay
must
be
dangerous
and
he
chafed
at
his
enforced
idleness
which
made
the
minutes
drag
at
last
the
door
opened
and
a
man
entered
it
was
the
same
man
who
had
come
to
summon
him
to
the
audience
last
night
you
are
welcome
ellerey
said
i
began
to
think
some
circumstance
had
intervened
we
have
only
just
escaped
such
a
calamity
was
the
answer
by
some
means
lord
cloverton
had
received
information
of
our
plans
in
the
presence
of
the
king
immediately
after
your
departure
he
accused
her
majesty
of
trafficking
with
the
brigands
in
the
hills
and
challenged
her
to
show
the
bracelet
it
was
fortunate
that
the
queen
could
do
so
and
indignantly
demand
apology
the
first
move
is
much
in
our
favor
for
the
accusation
made
the
king
extremely
angry
and
the
british
ambassador
is
in
ill
favor
his
hands
are
tied
for
a
little
while
at
any
rate
that
i
would
believe
if
i
saw
the
knotted
cords
about
his
wrists
but
not
otherwise
ellerey
answered
my
worthy
countryman
is
not
so
easily
beaten
it
is
true
her
majesty
bid
me
warn
you
but
without
the
king
what
can
he
do
he
is
capable
of
anything
and
has
the
english
vice
or
virtue
it
depends
on
the
point
of
view
of
never
knowing
when
he
has
got
the
worst
of
it
her
majesty
is
fortunate
in
also
having
an
englishman
for
her
messenger
thank
you
monsieur
i
think
there
is
something
of
the
same
spirit
in
me
there
is
the
token
captain
ellerey
and
the
man
handed
him
a
small
sealed
box
the
streets
are
yet
full
so
it
would
be
wise
to
delay
your
departure
for
a
while
her
majesty
also
bid
me
give
you
this
an
earnest
of
what
shall
fall
to
the
share
of
her
successful
messenger
in
ellerey
palm
lay
a
ring
the
jewel
in
it
catching
light
even
from
the
feeble
ray
of
the
candle
for
one
moment
ellerey
was
disposed
to
refuse
the
gift
until
he
had
earned
it
the
independence
of
the
englishman
rising
in
him
but
a
brief
hesitation
gave
the
spirit
of
the
adventurer
opportunity
to
rise
uppermost
he
might
fail
and
for
his
life
be
compelled
to
leave
sturatzberg
it
would
be
some
consolation
not
to
go
altogether
i
thank
her
majesty
he
said
i
shall
keep
it
as
a
key
to
win
her
further
favor
should
i
deserve
it
then
i
will
leave
you
captain
ellerey
fortune
smile
on
you
and
on
the
cause
as
the
door
closed
upon
his
visitor
ellerey
secured
the
sealed
box
and
the
ring
about
his
person
in
such
a
fashion
that
the
treasure
lay
close
to
the
skin
while
life
was
in
him
no
one
should
rob
him
of
it
then
he
sat
down
to
possess
his
soul
in
patience
until
the
streets
should
grow
dark
enough
and
empty
enough
for
his
departure
it
was
market
day
and
he
had
elected
to
go
by
the
southern
gate
at
the
hour
when
many
would
be
leaving
the
city
on
their
homeward
journey
he
had
no
desire
to
be
recognized
and
he
hoped
to
pass
unnoticed
in
the
crowd
stefan
had
arranged
to
have
his
horse
waiting
for
him
at
a
forester
cottage
off
the
breslen
road
a
mile
from
the
city
by
making
the
in
the
forest
toward
breslen
precaution
was
taken
that
should
riders
be
seen
going
in
this
direction
their
real
destination
would
never
be
suspected
the
brigands
lay
in
the
mountains
near
the
drekner
pass
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction
to
breslen
and
a
wide
detour
round
sturatzberg
would
have
to
be
accomplished
when
the
united
band
set
out
in
earnest
upon
its
expedition
the
token
was
at
last
in
his
possession
his
comrades
awaited
him
and
ellerey
was
anxious
to
be
gone
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
fail
by
being
too
precipitate
none
knew
better
the
value
of
deliberate
caution
and
with
lord
cloverton
fully
alive
to
the
danger
there
might
be
many
obstacles
to
face
which
had
not
entered
into
his
calculations
so
ellerey
sat
there
waiting
while
the
candle
burnt
lower
casting
as
the
room
darkened
a
sharper
outline
of
his
figure
upon
the
wall
time
surely
now
he
exclaimed
at
last
starting
to
his
feet
landlord
the
door
opened
so
suddenly
that
the
handle
must
have
been
turned
even
as
ellerey
shouted
but
it
was
not
the
landlord
who
entered
two
figures
came
in
swiftly
and
closed
the
door
pardon
captain
ellerey
well
sirs
what
would
you
with
me
i
have
little
time
to
waste
i
have
already
called
the
landlord
to
pay
my
reckoning
and
as
he
spoke
ellerey
raised
the
candle
above
his
head
to
see
what
manner
of
men
his
visitors
were
friends
captain
said
the
foremost
of
the
two
making
the
same
sign
which
had
gained
admittance
for
the
bearer
of
the
token
he
was
a
man
of
set
features
with
a
pair
of
keen
eyes
deeply
sunken
his
figure
was
lithe
and
sinewy
his
movements
quick
and
not
ungraceful
his
dress
was
of
the
better
peasant
class
a
short
knife
was
sheathed
in
his
girdle
and
one
hand
rested
lightly
on
the
hilt
of
it
as
he
stood
motionless
under
the
captain
scrutiny
he
might
have
been
a
forester
his
companion
stood
silently
in
the
shadows
behind
him
by
that
sign
you
should
know
the
business
i
have
in
hand
and
that
i
have
no
time
to
waste
in
words
true
captain
we
are
from
her
majesty
and
know
that
the
token
has
been
delivered
into
your
keeping
here
you
have
comrades
waiting
for
you
but
too
few
such
is
the
queen
opinion
and
she
bid
us
join
your
company
i
do
not
like
the
arrangement
ellerey
answered
my
comrades
are
picked
men
that
i
know
the
muscles
of
i
know
nothing
of
you
it
a
poor
welcome
captain
but
it
must
serve
i
have
other
news
for
you
which
may
increase
our
value
you
run
on
too
fast
my
friend
said
ellerey
your
coming
at
this
eleventh
hour
ill
fits
with
my
precaution
we
have
horses
without
the
city
captain
we
are
not
ill
conditioned
for
the
enterprise
you
may
pass
muster
for
a
man
what
is
your
name
anton
you
have
muscle
enough
to
strike
a
good
blow
on
occasion
but
i
know
naught
of
your
courage
and
your
companion
there
what
of
him
step
into
the
light
and
let
me
look
at
you
how
are
you
called
grigosie
if
it
please
you
captain
he
stepped
out
of
the
shadow
as
he
spoke
and
with
his
arms
folded
across
his
breast
threw
back
his
head
defiantly
as
though
such
inspection
were
little
to
his
taste
he
was
a
lad
in
figure
and
in
voice
his
face
was
innocent
of
even
the
down
of
dawning
manhood
his
limbs
were
clean
cut
and
supple
but
they
looked
too
young
for
stern
endurance
his
dress
was
similar
to
his
companion
save
that
it
was
green
in
color
and
he
wore
a
cap
of
green
drawn
down
to
his
brows
you
a
boy
enough
laughed
ellerey
but
heaven
forgive
her
majesty
does
she
think
i
am
bent
on
some
summer
picnic
that
she
sends
a
child
to
bear
me
company
we
are
wont
to
go
together
captain
grigosie
is
a
good
scout
and
i
warrant
is
likely
to
prove
useful
said
anton
for
cooking
and
bedmaking
maybe
we
shall
have
little
opportunity
for
either
one
or
the
other
illustration
you
will
pardon
me
countess
blank
page
nor
should
i
do
either
of
them
except
of
my
own
will
said
the
lad
a
stroke
or
two
of
the
whip
would
make
you
tell
a
different
tale
said
ellerey
and
you
may
thank
your
lucky
fortune
that
i
will
not
take
you
for
the
whip
would
certainly
follow
i
have
heard
of
captain
ellerey
said
the
boy
but
never
that
he
was
a
bully
ellerey
looked
at
him
quizzically
well
lad
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
you
do
not
lack
courage
and
you
grow
into
a
stout
man
for
rough
work
some
day
in
this
expedition
i
can
not
use
you
i
can
use
a
sword
and
am
a
master
of
fence
and
the
sword
is
not
the
only
weapon
which
victory
hangs
upon
peace
grigosie
i
will
give
the
captain
an
excellent
reason
for
taking
you
peace
yourself
anton
am
i
to
be
taken
out
of
charity
set
me
to
prove
my
worth
captain
i
have
no
time
lad
said
ellerey
picking
up
his
cloak
anton
may
come
since
we
are
few
but
there
is
a
fly
on
the
wall
captain
well
what
of
it
you
are
a
strange
lad
it
is
gone
i
warrant
but
in
case
i
have
missed
darkness
two
revolver
shots
cracked
in
quick
succession
as
he
spoke
and
the
room
was
in
darkness
then
the
landlord
rushed
in
the
candle
is
out
light
it
again
landlord
said
the
boy
and
then
when
it
had
burnt
up
he
pointed
with
the
revolver
to
the
spot
where
the
fly
had
been
and
where
now
there
was
a
hole
i
do
not
think
i
missed
leave
us
landlord
said
ellerey
it
was
the
deciding
of
a
foolish
boast
the
lad
slipped
the
revolver
into
his
pocket
again
and
refolded
his
arms
that
was
a
foolish
jest
youngster
ellerey
said
do
you
think
such
boastfulness
fits
you
for
such
work
as
ours
there
are
few
who
could
have
done
it
was
the
answer
true
such
precision
might
serve
you
were
your
enemies
three
to
one
true
again
then
ask
me
to
go
with
you
was
the
prompt
reply
may
i
not
even
take
you
out
of
charity
the
lad
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
and
there
was
something
very
winning
in
his
smile
very
well
will
you
come
with
me
asked
ellerey
to
the
death
your
hand
on
that
bargain
i
earn
the
grip
of
comradeship
before
i
take
it
captain
until
then
it
is
for
you
to
order
be
it
to
cooking
or
to
bedmaking
you
serve
for
sport
and
as
a
relief
to
monotony
if
for
nothing
else
said
ellerey
orders
then
we
must
be
starting
you
have
not
heard
my
further
news
said
anton
it
is
not
time
to
start
yet
ellerey
turned
upon
him
angrily
was
his
authority
so
soon
to
be
questioned
every
gate
is
closed
against
captain
ellerey
by
the
king
orders
said
anton
it
has
been
so
since
noon
is
the
scent
so
hot
already
we
shall
leave
the
city
but
not
yet
the
lad
here
will
show
us
the
way
anton
answered
you
see
i
am
to
be
of
some
service
quickly
captain
said
grigosie
trust
me
my
way
is
clear
enough
and
no
king
order
has
power
to
bar
it
we
must
wait
a
little
i
have
some
money
in
my
pouch
may
i
pay
for
liquor
you
doing
me
good
youngster
laughed
ellerey
order
your
drinks
and
tell
me
who
they
were
who
fathered
and
mothered
you
that
you
have
such
wit
you
are
not
fashioned
after
the
usual
breed
in
wallaria
i
am
of
the
pure
breed
which
is
being
forgotten
in
the
bastard
race
i
am
of
the
old
stock
reared
without
the
city
walls
anton
can
answer
for
me
that
i
can
the
drinks
were
brought
but
the
lad
drank
sparingly
ellerey
liked
him
none
the
worse
for
that
if
wine
were
found
upon
the
journey
one
sober
comrade
though
he
were
a
lad
might
be
more
profitable
than
half
a
dozen
boasters
the
boy
talked
brightly
and
his
air
of
boastfulness
fell
from
him
there
was
a
tone
of
deference
to
the
captain
in
his
manner
which
sat
gracefully
on
his
young
shoulders
were
it
not
that
they
brought
your
favor
i
should
regret
the
fly
and
the
candle
he
said
presently
i
crave
your
pardon
say
no
more
of
it
we
give
you
better
marks
before
long
maybe
you
carry
two
cloaks
captain
how
is
that
one
my
own
one
i
borrowed
this
morning
i
am
going
to
leave
it
with
the
landlord
to
be
returned
wear
it
until
we
are
free
of
the
city
it
may
conceal
you
from
some
prying
eyes
i
warrant
you
are
well
looked
for
have
we
far
to
travel
to
this
exit
of
yours
some
distance
and
by
narrow
ways
if
there
should
be
prying
eyes
we
must
close
them
quickly
we
want
no
shouts
to
raise
a
rabble
is
it
not
time
anton
yes
the
gates
have
been
closed
for
half
an
hour
come
then
said
the
lad
must
we
go
through
the
court
there
is
no
other
way
anton
answered
then
captain
will
you
permit
that
anton
and
i
go
first
said
grigosie
follow
close
upon
our
heels
but
should
we
stop
do
not
you
overtake
us
and
push
us
roughly
aside
and
we
will
overtake
you
again
in
a
moment
your
pardon
that
i
seem
to
lead
in
this
matter
but
i
know
the
road
we
must
take
ellerey
returned
a
gruff
assent
to
the
arrangement
he
had
looked
into
the
boy
eyes
and
seen
honesty
there
but
he
was
not
going
to
walk
carelessly
for
all
that
the
inn
was
empty
so
was
the
court
and
there
were
few
people
abroad
in
the
bergenstrasse
grigosie
and
anton
leading
the
way
by
scarce
a
dozen
paces
turned
almost
directly
from
the
main
thoroughfare
into
a
side
street
and
had
soon
turned
to
left
and
right
so
often
that
ellerey
would
hardly
have
found
his
way
back
to
the
toison
not
once
did
they
stop
and
if
they
looked
back
to
see
that
their
companion
was
following
them
ellerey
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
he
kept
close
upon
their
heels
ready
to
stand
on
the
defensive
at
the
first
sign
of
treachery
but
he
took
little
notice
of
where
they
led
him
suddenly
a
street
corner
struck
him
as
familiar
and
the
next
moment
the
truth
flashed
upon
him
it
was
the
street
he
had
traversed
last
night
at
the
bottom
there
they
had
met
baron
petrescu
even
now
the
light
was
dimly
burning
in
the
upper
window
as
it
had
been
then
grigosie
and
anton
stopped
but
when
ellerey
reached
them
he
did
not
push
them
aside
he
stopped
too
and
now
which
way
he
asked
toward
the
light
yonder
grigosie
answered
my
lad
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
i
trust
no
one
said
ellerey
i
know
that
light
it
marks
our
point
of
safety
yours
perhaps
not
mine
i
do
not
understand
captain
if
you
are
innocent
how
should
you
if
you
are
false
why
should
you
last
night
i
had
an
appointment
beneath
that
dim
lamp
with
difficulty
i
escaped
with
my
life
but
you
did
escape
you
know
how
there
will
be
no
duel
we
shall
go
direct
to
that
door
in
the
wall
who
was
this
youngster
that
he
knew
so
much
it
seems
to
me
a
desperate
chance
even
if
you
are
honest
in
advising
it
said
ellerey
look
you
lad
i
give
you
warning
my
life
i
am
prepared
to
give
but
if
by
treachery
it
is
taken
i
see
that
you
bear
me
company
on
that
journey
even
as
you
have
sworn
to
follow
me
to
the
death
on
the
other
i
am
content
was
the
short
answer
muffle
your
cloak
about
your
face
and
leave
me
to
speak
they
went
together
toward
the
light
and
grigosie
knocked
at
the
door
as
baron
petrescu
had
done
there
was
the
same
delay
the
shaggy
head
was
thrust
out
to
the
intruders
silence
reigned
again
until
the
stentorian
voice
had
shouted
and
then
the
clattering
and
the
voices
started
instantly
the
man
led
them
aside
into
the
same
room
pass
us
out
through
the
garden
and
ask
no
questions
said
grigosie
who
have
we
here
asked
the
man
pointing
to
ellerey
neither
ask
questions
nor
answer
any
grigosie
returned
that
too
pert
a
tongue
to
satisfy
me
growled
the
man
signs
and
passwords
are
easily
stolen
i
sooner
let
some
one
bear
witness
with
me
after
last
night
in
an
instant
the
lad
was
beside
him
what
he
said
was
in
so
low
a
tone
that
ellerey
could
not
catch
a
word
but
the
effect
was
magical
the
surly
brute
became
alert
and
obsequious
he
led
them
quickly
down
the
passage
and
opened
the
door
leading
into
the
garden
perhaps
grigosie
did
not
altogether
trust
him
for
he
caught
him
by
the
arm
saying
that
he
should
see
them
safely
through
the
garden
and
ellerey
noticed
that
anton
was
particular
to
keep
close
to
the
man
at
the
door
in
the
wall
the
boy
stopped
your
cloak
monsieur
he
said
turning
to
ellerey
you
wish
it
returned
do
you
not
ellerey
gave
it
to
him
and
nodded
but
did
not
speak
grigosie
gave
the
cloak
to
the
man
theodor
see
that
this
is
returned
to
captain
ward
at
the
british
embassy
send
it
by
a
trusted
messenger
and
let
him
say
that
he
had
it
from
captain
desmond
ellerey
an
hour
before
midnight
mark
the
time
when
he
met
him
in
the
konigplatz
the
man
bowed
low
as
he
opened
the
door
for
them
when
it
had
closed
upon
them
grigosie
turned
to
ellerey
are
you
satisfied
captain
the
boy
knowledge
astonished
ellerey
you
have
reproved
me
twice
youngster
first
for
being
a
bully
now
for
doubting
you
my
anger
is
forgotten
laughed
the
lad
the
cloak
was
a
good
thought
they
will
know
that
you
were
in
the
city
and
they
will
search
sturatzberg
for
you
all
day
so
we
gain
time
our
horses
await
us
on
the
breslen
road
and
yours
captain
also
on
the
breslen
road
then
captain
will
you
order
the
march
my
brief
command
is
over
chapter
xiii
the
castle
in
the
hills
the
first
light
of
a
new
day
awoke
a
chorus
of
blended
voices
within
the
depths
of
the
forest
the
early
matin
praise
of
the
birds
rose
high
and
clear
above
the
hymn
of
the
insects
the
trees
shook
out
their
rustling
garments
glorious
autumn
robes
of
color
scattering
the
dewy
tears
of
night
before
the
smiling
day
among
the
fallen
leaves
were
hasty
rushes
to
and
fro
while
rabbits
flashed
across
the
narrow
open
tracts
there
was
stirring
too
in
a
dry
hollow
securely
hidden
by
dense
undergrowth
from
any
traveller
who
chanced
to
pass
that
way
the
whinnying
of
a
horse
sounded
on
the
morning
air
the
rough
rubbing
of
leather
trappings
and
the
sharp
click
of
steel
there
were
gruff
laughter
and
gruffer
oaths
man
salutation
to
the
new
day
and
some
low
spoken
words
of
discontent
the
addition
to
their
number
was
not
pleasing
to
them
the
more
they
were
the
less
would
each
man
receive
as
reward
they
argued
last
night
they
were
and
had
barely
roused
at
ellerey
coming
the
men
who
had
come
with
him
they
supposed
were
soldiers
of
fortune
like
themselves
men
they
knew
and
even
they
were
not
welcome
but
with
morning
discontent
broke
out
the
new
arrivals
were
not
soldiers
were
strangers
to
them
and
one
at
least
was
a
mere
lad
what
good
was
he
in
their
company
stefan
did
not
complain
he
noted
anton
from
head
to
foot
and
did
not
like
him
he
looked
at
grigosie
and
he
laughed
aloud
he
turned
to
find
ellerey
close
beside
him
this
is
the
first
day
of
the
festival
then
captain
festival
surely
since
we
have
such
company
some
of
these
fellows
might
have
brought
their
sweethearts
with
them
had
they
known
the
kind
of
expedition
they
were
engaged
for
you
bid
me
choose
carefully
picked
men
who
held
life
and
death
in
such
easy
balance
that
they
would
take
whichever
happened
without
a
murmur
and
now
you
bring
us
a
lean
forester
who
is
good
for
naught
but
felling
trees
and
a
lad
whose
mother
might
still
whip
him
without
offence
the
lad
is
well
enough
stefan
and
served
me
well
last
night
thank
him
then
and
send
him
home
again
i
have
a
message
to
send
into
the
city
it
will
be
employment
for
him
to
take
it
no
he
goes
with
us
there
be
much
grumbling
captain
these
fellows
like
comrades
they
know
the
stomach
of
i
answer
for
the
boy
you
best
do
it
quickly
then
or
there
be
one
or
two
riding
back
into
sturatzberg
as
yesterday
they
rode
out
if
that
is
their
spirit
i
sooner
have
lads
like
yonder
beside
me
in
a
tight
place
ellerey
answered
angrily
then
he
went
to
the
men
who
were
looking
to
their
saddle
girths
preparatory
to
mounting
comrades
we
have
a
journey
before
us
which
may
run
smoothly
but
which
may
bring
us
hard
knocks
the
reward
is
generous
to
those
who
win
through
are
we
prepared
to
take
our
chances
one
and
all
he
paused
but
only
a
grunt
of
tardy
consent
answered
him
last
night
i
brought
two
others
to
join
in
our
enterprise
what
need
of
them
growled
one
man
and
one
of
them
a
boy
they
go
with
me
whoever
else
stays
behind
said
ellerey
turning
quickly
to
the
man
who
had
spoken
have
you
faith
enough
in
me
to
trust
my
discretion
there
was
no
reply
it
must
be
tacit
obedience
swift
action
to
my
command
from
every
man
who
bears
me
company
mount
in
a
moment
every
one
was
in
his
saddle
excepting
ellerey
himself
who
stood
with
his
horse
bridle
over
his
arm
yonder
lies
the
breslen
road
an
easy
morning
canter
into
sturatzberg
who
likes
may
ride
that
way
and
free
himself
from
my
authority
no
man
spoke
or
moved
then
are
we
comrades
and
do
not
growl
among
ourselves
said
ellerey
springing
into
his
saddle
forward
you
must
find
some
other
carrier
for
your
message
stefan
and
soon
or
i
have
murder
on
my
soul
was
the
answer
as
the
troop
rode
singly
out
of
the
hollow
and
picked
its
way
along
a
forest
track
it
was
high
noon
before
they
chanced
upon
a
woodcutter
and
his
boy
give
me
leave
captain
said
stefan
bringing
his
horse
to
a
standstill
here
one
may
take
my
message
aye
there
how
far
is
it
to
sturatzberg
by
the
shortest
road
five
miles
by
foot
but
riding
you
scarce
do
it
in
ten
answered
the
woodcutter
will
you
or
the
lad
carry
a
message
there
i
would
i
go
with
a
team
there
taking
timber
mused
stefan
why
not
he
last
until
then
well
then
here
a
key
take
it
to
the
altstrasse
do
you
know
the
altstrasse
surely
i
have
a
brother
living
there
to
the
altstrasse
thirteen
to
the
house
of
monsieur
de
froilette
i
have
heard
of
him
then
you
will
do
him
this
service
said
stefan
give
him
the
key
and
say
that
if
he
has
lost
his
servant
this
key
fits
a
certain
cellar
door
in
a
certain
lodging
by
the
western
gate
he
will
guess
which
lodging
his
servant
loving
wine
too
much
lies
behind
that
cellar
door
howling
for
his
liberty
i
take
the
message
here
for
refreshment
by
the
way
said
stefan
tossing
him
the
key
and
a
coin
monsieur
de
froilette
will
reward
you
liberally
i
warrant
and
who
shall
i
say
gave
me
the
key
say
a
woman
you
met
by
the
road
if
your
conscience
will
sanction
the
lie
if
not
say
a
man
and
word
my
picture
as
you
please
so
that
you
make
it
handsome
enough
but
do
not
fail
to
deliver
the
message
for
the
man
behind
that
door
is
slowly
dying
and
if
you
do
not
go
to
his
rescue
will
surely
curse
you
from
his
grave
what
does
this
mean
stefan
ellerey
asked
as
the
troop
rode
on
laughing
at
their
companion
francois
was
watching
us
and
saw
the
boy
who
carried
your
message
to
me
yesterday
he
came
to
question
me
thinking
me
a
fool
and
went
with
me
to
the
cellar
to
hear
my
story
and
to
drink
your
wine
he
got
no
story
and
little
wine
for
that
matter
unless
the
ropes
have
slipped
from
his
wrists
and
ankles
i
tied
him
securely
before
i
made
him
free
of
all
the
cellar
contained
he
be
wanting
food
badly
by
when
his
master
finds
him
it
was
well
done
stefan
we
want
no
spies
about
us
but
why
should
monsieur
de
froilette
spy
upon
me
for
the
same
reason
that
a
hawk
watches
its
prey
it
his
nature
you
may
snatch
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire
for
monsieur
but
it
only
the
charred
husks
will
be
your
portion
if
the
dividing
is
left
to
him
all
that
day
they
kept
to
the
forest
making
a
wide
detour
round
sturatzberg
progress
was
slow
along
the
narrow
tracks
and
they
went
singly
for
the
most
part
careful
of
their
horses
steps
that
night
they
lay
within
a
circle
of
trees
deep
hidden
in
the
woods
and
far
from
the
road
for
two
days
they
were
able
to
hold
to
the
forest
and
had
no
expectation
of
being
surprised
they
met
no
one
save
an
occasional
woodcutter
or
and
once
they
disturbed
some
robbers
who
were
perhaps
near
the
place
of
their
hidden
booty
on
the
third
day
they
were
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
much
open
country
lay
between
them
and
the
mountains
the
utmost
caution
was
necessary
now
ellerey
called
grigosie
to
him
anton
said
that
you
would
be
useful
at
scouting
work
yes
captain
you
will
go
forward
with
stefan
use
your
eyes
and
ears
well
the
lad
saluted
and
presently
rode
out
with
stefan
anton
asked
to
go
with
them
but
this
ellerey
would
not
allow
he
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
separating
grigosie
from
his
companion
for
a
little
while
he
had
no
reason
to
suspect
them
but
keeping
them
apart
was
a
precaution
ellerey
had
instructed
stefan
to
use
the
lad
well
and
with
a
grim
smile
upon
his
face
the
soldier
rode
with
his
youthful
companion
keeping
silence
for
a
time
you
a
slip
of
a
lad
for
such
work
as
we
have
on
hand
he
said
presently
how
came
your
mother
to
part
with
you
so
early
rest
her
soul
she
dead
your
father
then
dead
also
answered
grigosie
well
you
knew
them
and
understand
whether
their
loss
was
a
big
one
or
not
said
stefan
parents
have
counted
for
much
in
my
case
so
i
not
qualified
to
speak
of
their
usefulness
you
managed
to
grow
into
a
likely
sort
of
lad
who
had
the
training
of
you
i
my
own
manufacture
for
the
most
part
answered
grigosie
but
i
not
too
proud
to
learn
from
an
old
campaigner
like
you
stefan
the
soldier
drew
himself
up
in
his
saddle
and
looked
knowingly
at
his
young
comrade
there
sense
in
you
maybe
i
can
teach
you
a
few
things
my
experience
has
been
wide
and
peculiar
and
if
you
listen
to
my
advice
and
model
your
fighting
on
mine
you
make
a
soldier
not
of
my
girth
perhaps
for
that
a
gift
of
nature
and
not
to
be
had
for
the
asking
no
i
shall
always
be
of
the
lean
sort
i
fear
said
grigosie
do
you
be
discouraged
lad
there
often
good
stuff
in
the
lean
ones
it
deep
potations
that
give
a
man
breadth
sometimes
and
his
habit
of
growling
strange
oaths
that
gets
him
credit
for
valor
grigosie
plied
him
with
questions
and
heard
many
a
strange
tale
of
fighting
in
which
stefan
had
done
marvellous
things
is
there
no
reward
for
bravery
in
wallaria
said
grigosie
at
last
how
is
it
that
no
great
distinction
has
come
to
you
stefan
turned
toward
him
and
shut
one
eye
dodge
the
distinctions
lad
as
you
would
the
devil
they
lead
to
court
and
the
society
of
women
two
things
to
be
avoided
why
so
stefan
court
fetters
a
man
as
a
chain
does
a
dog
and
is
unnatural
while
a
woman
is
the
keenest
weapon
in
all
the
devil
armory
i
have
heard
some
well
spoken
of
said
grigosie
and
they
are
the
most
dangerous
said
stefan
why
do
you
suppose
women
were
made
pretty
and
fashioned
to
wear
pretty
clothes
indeed
i
can
not
tell
to
conceal
their
natural
defects
lad
whenever
you
see
a
pretty
woman
look
at
the
next
harridan
you
meet
and
remember
that
the
difference
between
them
is
only
on
the
surface
you
are
too
hard
stefan
said
grigosie
laughing
heartily
wisdom
youngster
the
ripe
wisdom
of
experience
i
wonder
whether
the
captain
is
of
your
way
of
thinking
stefan
i
have
seen
him
pause
in
the
midst
of
his
drink
sometimes
which
has
made
me
anxious
the
fetters
of
the
court
perhaps
said
grigosie
seemed
to
me
it
was
more
like
a
woman
was
the
answer
that
night
they
encamped
between
two
spurs
of
the
lower
hills
two
hours
before
sunset
they
had
begun
to
ascend
from
the
plain
it
was
among
the
hills
they
would
be
looked
for
as
soon
as
the
object
of
their
mission
were
known
and
having
chosen
a
which
could
easily
be
defended
against
odds
ellerey
placed
sentinels
to
prevent
any
surprise
the
was
pleasant
to
draw
close
to
for
the
night
was
cold
ellerey
lay
in
a
position
his
feet
stretched
toward
the
blaze
and
at
some
little
distance
on
the
opposite
side
the
men
were
sitting
in
a
circle
playing
cards
grigosie
and
anton
standing
beside
them
looking
on
there
boy
what
did
i
tell
you
he
heard
stefan
say
as
he
turned
to
grigosie
a
woman
again
plays
me
false
and
it
the
queen
of
hearts
too
the
boy
laughed
evidently
he
and
stefan
had
become
fast
friends
during
their
day
ride
together
it
was
a
merry
laugh
pleasant
ellerey
thought
after
the
gruffer
tones
of
the
soldiers
presently
the
boy
left
anton
side
and
threw
himself
down
by
the
fire
near
ellerey
are
you
tired
grigosie
a
little
lately
i
have
not
been
used
to
so
many
hours
in
the
saddle
what
point
do
we
make
for
the
drekner
pass
do
you
know
it
i
was
quite
a
youngster
when
i
last
crossed
it
was
the
answer
there
used
to
be
a
castle
there
perched
on
the
like
an
eagle
eyrie
so
many
years
can
not
have
passed
since
then
that
the
castle
should
have
crumbled
away
said
ellerey
with
a
smile
i
expect
it
is
still
there
you
do
not
know
the
pass
then
no
grigosie
lapsed
into
silence
and
then
after
a
while
he
said
suddenly
some
day
i
hope
to
be
an
honored
soldier
like
you
are
captain
wish
better
things
for
yourself
grigosie
are
you
not
honored
then
enough
to
be
given
a
dangerous
post
and
to
receive
good
reward
if
you
succeed
the
queen
will
load
you
with
gifts
and
perhaps
greater
happiness
still
some
other
woman
will
smile
on
you
you
begin
to
think
of
such
things
over
early
ellerey
answered
you
have
your
troubles
soon
enough
that
way
no
doubt
already
captain
so
soon
this
is
a
southern
country
and
we
begin
early
are
you
a
as
stefan
is
in
the
back
of
my
mind
there
is
a
reverence
for
women
keep
it
lad
if
you
can
it
may
bring
you
to
much
good
for
my
part
i
hardly
know
my
position
in
the
matter
would
telling
the
tale
to
me
help
your
judgment
inquired
the
lad
a
man
does
not
speak
of
such
things
often
grigosie
ah
your
love
tale
has
advanced
some
way
then
it
was
not
a
glance
and
a
passing
word
and
a
thorn
left
in
the
heart
to
hurt
terribly
at
times
that
was
my
case
there
is
a
woman
i
deeply
respect
and
honor
said
ellerey
to
love
her
would
be
much
to
my
advantage
why
not
then
asked
the
boy
because
of
a
memory
the
memory
of
another
woman
with
her
it
was
a
passing
word
and
a
look
but
they
came
to
me
when
life
was
at
its
darkness
and
i
have
never
forgotten
them
it
was
an
early
morning
in
england
a
morning
that
has
no
equal
in
the
whole
world
full
of
sunshine
and
breeze
and
perfume
and
she
came
into
it
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
she
would
not
choose
to
remember
me
if
she
thought
such
a
memory
lingered
in
my
heart
she
was
out
of
my
reach
even
then
and
in
those
days
i
was
something
more
than
a
captain
of
horse
but
after
this
enterprise
you
will
be
something
more
i
can
not
become
a
prince
grigosie
and
my
lady
of
the
breezy
morning
was
a
princess
really
or
is
that
your
fanciful
name
for
her
really
a
princess
ellerey
answered
i
wonder
why
i
should
be
telling
this
story
to
you
is
there
not
sympathy
between
all
who
love
grigosie
answered
it
is
the
one
common
bond
there
is
in
the
world
knowing
no
difference
of
creed
or
nationality
for
two
days
the
little
band
journeyed
in
the
mountains
keeping
to
the
lower
track
on
account
of
the
horses
progress
was
slow
for
the
going
was
rough
and
the
horses
often
had
to
be
led
the
track
lay
between
the
lower
hills
and
the
main
mountain
range
and
they
had
lost
sight
of
the
open
country
which
lay
below
them
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
that
they
crossed
a
spur
which
jutted
out
toward
the
plain
and
from
its
vantage
ground
grigosie
was
the
first
to
point
out
the
head
of
the
pass
a
precipitous
opening
in
the
mountains
to
their
left
at
the
same
time
stefan
looking
across
the
open
country
pointed
out
a
cloud
of
dust
on
the
horizon
that
means
a
moving
body
of
men
he
said
in
the
pass
lies
our
greatest
security
until
we
are
prepared
to
meet
the
enemy
ellerey
answered
if
that
castle
of
yours
has
not
crumbled
to
dust
grigosie
it
will
make
excellent
quarters
for
us
the
drekner
pass
had
long
ago
ceased
to
be
used
once
doubtless
it
was
the
highway
into
wallaria
from
the
north
but
that
was
long
ago
not
within
the
memory
of
the
oldest
man
nature
herself
had
closed
the
way
by
casting
a
great
spur
of
the
mountain
into
the
deepest
and
narrowest
part
of
the
defile
it
was
still
possible
to
climb
this
but
it
had
effectually
closed
the
pass
for
all
useful
purposes
and
the
castle
which
in
old
times
had
been
used
to
guard
the
way
had
fallen
into
decay
it
stood
gaunt
against
the
hillside
upon
a
natural
plateau
the
pathway
to
it
long
and
cut
out
in
the
hillside
vegetation
had
taken
root
in
the
crevices
of
its
broken
walls
and
some
of
the
stonework
shivered
by
the
lightning
stroke
perhaps
lay
in
the
roadway
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
silence
reigned
and
an
eagle
hovering
on
the
heights
above
doubtless
had
his
eyrie
there
a
thin
stream
of
water
trickled
down
the
hillside
finding
its
way
from
the
snow
on
the
mountains
which
reared
heads
here
and
there
above
their
humbler
brethren
my
castle
in
the
hills
cried
grigosie
enthusiastically
as
a
turn
of
the
track
brought
it
in
view
peace
grigosie
and
take
that
child
chatter
of
yours
to
the
rear
said
ellerey
then
turning
to
stefan
he
directed
him
and
another
of
the
men
to
climb
up
carefully
to
the
plateau
some
outpost
of
vasilici
may
hold
it
he
remarked
leaving
their
horses
stefan
and
his
companion
went
up
the
way
and
were
lost
to
view
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
their
figures
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
plateau
and
waved
to
their
comrades
to
ascend
my
castle
anton
whispered
grigosie
it
was
i
who
told
them
that
it
stood
here
they
liked
not
your
claiming
it
so
they
will
forgive
much
to
my
youth
even
if
i
am
put
to
cooking
and
bedmaking
as
punishment
laughed
the
boy
you
shall
be
snug
anton
and
know
that
the
gods
are
with
us
the
incline
of
the
way
had
been
carefully
graduated
so
that
it
was
possible
to
lead
horses
up
and
they
all
dismounted
and
went
singly
at
the
top
of
the
path
a
stone
gateway
broken
and
of
small
service
now
shut
in
the
plateau
this
was
the
only
means
of
reaching
the
castle
and
in
old
times
formed
the
first
point
of
defence
empty
but
an
airy
perch
to
spend
the
night
said
stefan
meeting
them
at
the
gateway
here
a
trysting
place
for
every
wind
that
blows
and
holes
enough
for
them
to
whistle
through
this
was
evident
the
walls
were
broken
in
every
direction
and
heaps
of
stonework
lay
scattered
on
all
sides
the
tower
yonder
seems
to
have
held
together
said
ellerey
aye
there
fine
sleeping
room
there
and
you
may
see
the
stars
through
the
roof
but
the
tower
had
much
to
commend
it
the
door
that
closed
it
still
hung
upon
its
hinges
and
in
the
lower
chamber
at
least
there
were
no
rents
in
the
wall
save
the
window
holes
narrow
slits
in
the
outside
but
widening
inward
through
the
thickness
of
the
walls
on
one
side
stone
steps
unprotected
in
any
way
led
to
the
floor
above
which
was
entered
through
a
trap
door
still
in
place
and
capable
of
being
bolted
down
here
the
walls
were
broken
in
places
and
part
of
the
roof
had
fallen
more
steps
which
mounted
to
the
roof
ended
abruptly
and
were
open
to
the
sky
a
turret
had
been
displaced
at
some
time
and
had
crashed
through
breaking
part
of
the
stairs
away
we
can
make
shift
to
stable
the
horses
between
some
of
the
walls
outside
and
ourselves
in
the
tower
said
ellerey
it
might
be
worse
stefan
and
with
fortune
our
stay
will
be
short
it
must
be
if
we
to
live
there
is
no
food
for
a
siege
stefan
answered
meanwhile
the
men
had
unsaddled
and
a
fire
was
already
crackling
on
the
old
hearth
there
was
promise
of
comfort
for
the
night
and
they
were
not
disposed
to
grumble
while
some
looked
to
the
horses
others
made
haste
to
prepare
a
meal
a
kid
caught
earlier
in
the
day
suggested
a
feast
others
finding
a
broken
door
made
shift
to
set
it
on
four
stones
improvising
a
table
on
which
they
set
out
the
wine
flasks
and
the
food
they
carried
with
them
while
one
man
paced
up
and
down
the
edge
of
the
plateau
watching
the
mountains
opposite
and
the
pass
beneath
kid
flesh
even
when
roasted
over
a
wood
fire
may
not
be
to
the
taste
of
all
who
can
choose
their
viands
but
it
is
honest
food
for
all
that
and
no
one
round
that
improvised
table
uttered
a
word
against
it
more
logs
had
been
piled
on
the
fire
and
the
blaze
threw
dancing
shadows
on
the
stone
walls
and
lit
up
the
rough
faces
of
the
men
they
were
silent
for
a
while
their
sharp
set
appetites
fully
occupying
them
but
a
draught
of
wine
set
the
tongues
wagging
again
a
song
stefan
i
heard
you
roar
a
good
stave
ere
this
not
a
love
song
surely
said
grigosie
no
of
wine
in
all
the
verse
i
ever
heard
love
and
wine
strangely
go
together
said
the
boy
proving
that
the
joys
of
both
are
transitory
perhaps
said
ellerey
who
sat
beside
him
he
spoke
only
to
grigosie
but
stefan
heard
him
love
captain
a
snap
of
the
fingers
for
love
but
wine
the
very
heart
of
life
there
wisdom
and
truth
in
wine
there
valor
in
it
and
it
powerful
enough
to
make
even
good
sound
men
fall
in
love
there
a
stave
i
heard
which
you
may
have
if
you
will
and
with
much
sound
but
little
music
stefan
broke
into
song
it
was
a
tavern
ditty
and
not
too
nice
in
its
sentiments
as
indeed
why
should
it
be
to
please
its
hearers
there
was
a
lilt
in
its
chorus
which
even
stefan
unmusical
voice
could
not
hide
and
it
set
the
men
heads
nodding
in
time
as
they
roared
it
out
together
waking
the
echoes
with
the
declaration
that
the
eye
of
a
maid
may
sparkle
and
the
fools
may
for
love
repine
but
the
wise
man
knows
as
his
road
he
goes
that
the
best
of
life
gifts
is
wine
that
is
true
is
it
captain
whispered
grigosie
we
know
better
than
that
ellerey
laughed
but
he
was
not
displeased
to
keep
the
lad
in
low
conversation
the
song
had
let
loose
a
flood
of
jest
and
anecdote
which
lost
none
of
their
ribaldry
in
the
telling
they
were
ill
suited
for
a
boy
to
hear
and
batten
on
yes
lad
we
know
better
you
and
i
he
said
let
them
talk
we
need
not
listen
i
suppose
it
is
natural
in
youth
to
shudder
at
some
things
they
talk
of
and
much
i
do
not
understand
keeping
such
ignorance
you
will
be
the
happier
and
do
not
drink
much
wine
grigosie
you
must
take
your
turn
at
sentry
duty
it
is
share
and
share
alike
in
an
enterprise
like
this
grant
then
there
be
stars
i
never
feel
lonely
under
the
stars
the
lad
answered
it
was
good
wine
that
was
poured
into
my
flask
at
starting
i
have
hardly
tasted
it
until
now
is
yours
good
it
might
be
worse
and
i
was
never
a
heavy
drinker
taste
mine
no
lad
why
should
i
rob
you
indeed
it
will
be
no
robbery
if
you
do
not
take
it
i
shall
offer
it
to
stefan
presently
it
is
too
strong
for
me
i
taste
it
before
i
sleep
if
you
will
the
air
is
close
here
let
us
go
and
fill
our
lungs
with
mountain
breezes
the
boy
sprang
to
his
feet
at
once
careful
to
take
his
wine
flask
with
him
and
followed
ellerey
on
to
the
plateau
there
were
stars
in
the
clear
sky
and
a
crescent
moon
that
seemed
to
be
poised
on
a
sharp
edge
of
the
higher
mountains
the
air
was
keen
tingling
in
throat
and
nostrils
the
wise
man
knows
as
his
road
he
goes
that
the
best
of
gifts
is
wine
came
again
the
lilting
chorus
from
the
tower
it
was
the
only
sound
that
disturbed
the
silence
the
silence
of
a
world
a
night
for
regrets
captain
yet
one
to
speed
ambition
said
grigosie
yours
has
been
too
short
to
accumulate
regrets
they
get
heaped
together
very
rapidly
sometimes
was
the
reply
how
long
shall
we
stay
here
only
until
we
have
seen
vasilici
and
delivered
our
message
and
then
back
to
sturatzberg
with
our
demands
backed
by
an
army
of
patriots
said
grigosie
and
for
the
success
of
the
scheme
how
do
you
reckon
the
chances
if
i
expected
failure
i
should
not
be
here
your
own
ambition
supplies
the
motive
then
there
is
no
love
for
a
cause
behind
hush
lad
those
are
dangerous
questions
to
ask
a
soldier
if
i
know
that
reward
awaits
success
it
is
as
certain
that
failure
means
death
those
who
employ
my
sword
would
not
hesitate
to
sacrifice
me
to
save
the
situation
so
you
see
grigosie
you
set
out
on
a
venture
some
enterprise
when
you
joined
my
company
yes
we
may
fail
and
die
and
yet
other
nights
will
be
just
as
full
of
stars
as
this
is
i
wonder
how
it
is
that
such
a
beautiful
world
is
cursed
to
go
so
awry
chiefly
my
lad
because
most
of
us
care
nothing
about
the
beauty
but
think
only
of
using
it
as
a
plaything
let
us
go
in
again
you
should
sleep
before
you
go
on
duty
some
of
the
men
had
already
stretched
themselves
cut
in
sleep
and
there
was
weariness
in
the
slow
speech
of
the
others
only
anton
seemed
really
awake
and
he
did
not
speak
as
the
two
entered
the
tower
here
is
the
wine
grigosie
whispered
handing
the
flask
to
ellerey
drink
to
success
in
it
to
success
in
war
and
love
chapter
xiv
the
token
is
delivered
the
logs
burnt
low
upon
the
hearth
and
only
a
feeble
light
was
in
the
tower
anton
saw
ellerey
drink
the
wine
and
then
cast
himself
down
not
far
from
grigosie
but
it
was
too
dim
for
him
to
see
whether
all
his
companions
were
asleep
some
certainly
were
for
they
snored
and
others
were
restless
for
they
shifted
their
positions
at
intervals
and
sighed
heavily
where
ellerey
and
grigosie
were
there
was
deep
shadow
growing
deeper
as
the
fire
died
down
one
sleeper
there
was
restless
for
a
little
while
and
then
his
breathing
proclaimed
that
his
sleep
was
heavy
once
anton
thought
there
was
a
darker
shadow
within
the
shadow
which
moved
quite
silently
but
he
did
not
speak
he
only
listened
very
eagerly
and
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
a
little
presently
anton
slept
too
ellerey
awoke
with
a
start
some
shock
in
a
dream
seemed
to
wake
him
and
as
he
raised
himself
his
hand
went
to
his
breast
as
it
constantly
did
on
waking
the
token
lay
there
safely
then
he
leaned
over
toward
grigosie
and
stretched
out
his
arm
the
lad
place
was
empty
he
was
startled
for
a
moment
as
men
may
be
on
awaking
suddenly
from
a
dream
but
he
quickly
recovered
himself
remembering
that
the
lad
was
sentry
part
of
the
night
he
lay
down
again
being
but
could
not
sleep
the
air
was
oppressive
and
a
dull
pain
was
in
his
head
as
though
a
steel
band
were
clasped
tightly
round
his
forehead
the
dream
was
still
surging
unpleasantly
through
his
brain
and
at
last
his
restlessness
prompted
him
to
go
out
on
to
the
plateau
the
stars
were
still
bright
but
the
crescent
moon
had
gone
at
the
edge
of
the
plateau
resting
upon
his
gun
stood
the
motionless
figure
of
the
sentry
ellerey
did
not
wish
to
startle
him
so
coughed
slightly
to
let
him
know
of
his
presence
the
boy
did
not
turn
grigosie
is
that
you
captain
i
was
just
coming
to
call
you
watch
the
mountain
opposite
and
tell
me
if
my
eyes
are
deceiving
me
there
is
nothing
for
the
moment
but
wait
and
look
steadily
the
top
of
the
opposite
side
of
the
pass
stood
out
clearly
against
the
sky
but
below
was
darkness
grigosie
pointed
to
that
part
which
lay
rather
below
the
level
of
the
plateau
on
which
they
were
standing
they
must
be
good
eyes
to
see
anything
there
said
ellerey
wait
whispered
the
boy
even
as
he
spoke
there
shone
for
a
moment
a
wisp
of
light
like
a
firefly
in
the
darkness
and
then
another
moving
a
little
below
it
several
times
this
was
repeated
in
different
places
in
the
darkness
the
point
of
light
gleaming
for
a
moment
only
and
then
suddenly
going
out
they
have
followed
us
captain
and
by
morning
will
have
climbed
high
enough
to
command
this
position
when
did
you
first
see
the
lights
grigosie
not
ten
minutes
ago
get
to
the
gate
at
the
top
of
the
pass
quickly
i
will
call
the
others
the
boy
ran
to
his
post
at
once
and
in
a
few
moments
the
whole
of
the
little
company
was
upon
the
plateau
watching
the
points
of
light
which
came
and
went
on
the
mountain
opposite
there
was
no
more
sleep
that
night
only
a
waiting
for
dawn
and
as
daylight
crept
slowly
down
them
the
mountains
looked
innocent
enough
the
sunlight
bursting
suddenly
over
the
eastern
ridges
glinted
upon
no
points
of
steel
betraying
hidden
men
in
the
hollows
of
the
hills
ellerey
and
stefan
stood
together
looking
for
such
a
sign
or
the
thin
curl
of
smoke
from
a
there
no
army
from
sturatzberg
yonder
captain
said
the
soldier
whoever
climbed
there
last
night
showed
lights
only
to
guide
their
fellows
either
not
expecting
us
to
see
them
or
not
knowing
that
we
are
here
the
brigands
perhaps
said
ellerey
the
same
thought
was
in
my
mind
stefan
answered
sharp
eyes
watched
from
the
plateau
during
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
weapons
were
looked
to
and
the
horses
saddled
ready
for
any
emergency
but
no
attempt
was
made
to
conceal
their
presence
there
sharp
eyes
doubtless
had
also
watched
their
movements
from
the
mountains
opposite
for
three
men
presently
appeared
in
the
pass
below
by
what
path
they
came
there
the
watchers
on
the
plateau
could
not
tell
no
sign
of
them
had
they
perceived
until
they
suddenly
stood
in
full
view
to
travel
in
such
fashion
those
must
be
born
mountaineers
said
stefan
shall
i
signal
to
them
captain
yes
let
them
come
up
the
path
we
will
meet
them
at
the
top
grigosie
you
stand
on
the
rising
ground
there
and
if
there
be
any
sign
of
treachery
see
you
repeat
the
marksmanship
you
boast
of
the
three
men
came
up
the
path
fearlessly
they
did
not
pause
when
they
saw
the
soldiers
waiting
for
them
at
the
ruined
gateway
but
came
on
until
they
halted
some
five
paces
in
front
of
them
we
are
sent
to
know
your
mission
in
the
hills
said
one
stepping
slightly
in
advance
of
his
companions
from
whom
do
you
come
inquired
ellerey
from
a
friend
if
we
make
no
mistake
one
whom
you
are
sent
to
seek
near
the
drekner
pass
are
you
from
queen
elena
i
am
the
bearer
of
a
message
to
vasilici
you
are
welcome
then
we
will
bring
you
to
him
is
he
far
from
here
the
man
turned
and
pointed
up
the
pass
an
hour
journey
we
will
come
the
message
i
carry
will
need
prompt
action
for
across
the
plain
there
are
troops
watching
the
road
to
sturatzberg
there
are
more
ways
than
one
to
the
capital
and
many
men
in
those
troops
perchance
who
will
welcome
the
sight
of
us
i
do
not
doubt
it
ellerey
answered
is
the
way
passable
for
horses
we
shall
not
want
to
return
here
yes
to
the
entrance
of
the
chief
how
many
are
you
ten
in
all
your
numbers
guarantee
a
friendly
message
was
the
smiling
answer
we
will
await
you
at
the
foot
of
the
path
as
the
men
departed
grigosie
lowered
the
rifle
which
he
had
held
ready
for
use
his
finger
resting
lightly
on
the
trigger
but
he
did
not
move
from
his
post
until
ellerey
called
him
ready
lad
we
march
at
once
you
are
satisfied
with
the
embassy
quite
in
an
hour
time
the
first
stage
of
our
mission
will
be
accomplished
and
then
the
result
lies
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
said
ellerey
do
we
all
go
asked
the
boy
yes
and
leave
none
to
keep
this
refuge
what
should
we
want
with
a
refuge
we
have
come
too
far
for
that
if
success
does
not
lie
in
the
road
before
us
the
only
refuge
we
can
hope
for
is
in
death
i
have
a
strange
liking
for
life
captain
just
now
the
men
led
their
horses
down
the
path
ellerey
and
stefan
bringing
up
the
rear
grigosie
turned
to
look
back
at
the
ruined
walls
and
the
tower
standing
gaunt
against
the
he
had
enthusiastically
called
it
his
and
in
the
desertion
of
it
there
may
have
been
some
regret
from
the
castle
the
lad
eyes
followed
the
shape
and
direction
of
the
ridges
which
lay
about
it
as
though
to
impress
the
picture
on
his
mind
but
he
spoke
no
word
and
studiously
avoided
anton
eyes
which
questioned
him
he
was
in
no
mood
to
reduce
the
thoughts
which
surged
through
his
brain
to
any
order
they
raged
and
beat
against
the
unknown
shores
of
the
future
as
a
ocean
will
against
a
rocky
coast
carrying
with
them
his
hopes
and
ambitions
which
were
driven
to
and
fro
like
brave
craft
struggling
against
shipwreck
there
was
some
reason
why
he
should
regret
the
comparatively
quiet
haven
of
that
castle
in
the
hills
in
silence
he
mounted
with
the
others
at
the
foot
of
the
path
and
the
little
band
of
horsemen
proceeded
at
walking
pace
so
that
the
envoys
from
vasilici
who
were
on
foot
might
keep
up
with
them
ellerey
and
stefan
rode
side
by
side
and
at
a
sign
from
the
former
fell
a
few
paces
farther
in
the
rear
it
is
evident
that
we
shall
presently
have
to
leave
the
horses
stefan
you
and
anton
shall
stay
with
them
while
the
rest
of
us
go
forward
to
deliver
the
token
while
you
wait
keep
a
keen
lookout
on
the
hillsides
and
on
on
anton
stefan
suggested
i
need
no
bidding
captain
i
do
not
trust
him
i
should
trust
him
still
less
had
i
not
taken
a
liking
to
his
companion
grigosie
the
boy
is
stanch
i
think
but
it
is
perhaps
as
well
to
have
them
separated
said
ellerey
that
is
why
i
leave
anton
to
you
he
be
in
strict
company
captain
have
no
fear
i
see
no
reason
to
doubt
success
said
ellerey
after
a
pause
almost
as
if
he
had
misgivings
and
wanted
to
be
laughed
out
of
them
there
are
many
who
have
looked
upon
success
and
yet
have
not
had
arm
long
enough
to
grasp
it
said
stefan
it
as
well
not
to
smack
the
lips
until
the
liquor
is
running
in
the
throat
their
way
lay
up
the
pass
toward
the
narrow
defile
which
nature
had
closed
long
ago
there
was
an
upward
incline
but
it
was
quite
easy
for
the
horses
the
pass
gradually
narrowed
as
they
went
and
the
grew
more
precipitous
shutting
them
in
like
great
walls
on
either
side
little
foothold
was
there
for
a
lurking
enemy
and
there
were
no
deep
gorges
where
an
ambuscade
might
hide
to
defend
this
part
of
the
pass
in
the
old
days
must
have
meant
a
struggle
in
the
narrow
way
ellerey
noted
this
as
he
went
his
life
in
sturatzberg
had
made
him
observant
presently
the
leading
horseman
stopped
it
is
difficult
work
for
horses
from
here
said
one
of
the
brigands
they
can
be
fetched
afterward
to
the
place
the
chief
directs
you
stefan
and
anton
will
stay
with
them
said
ellerey
i
will
send
grigosie
back
with
orders
presently
take
orders
from
none
but
grigosie
stefan
saluted
and
gathered
the
bridles
together
smiling
to
see
that
anton
was
not
pleased
at
being
left
behind
he
looked
at
his
youthful
comrade
who
took
no
notice
of
him
and
obeyed
with
an
ill
grace
why
should
he
leave
us
he
asked
when
the
others
had
gone
climbing
the
slope
in
front
of
them
why
not
asked
stefan
laconically
it
is
the
business
of
servants
and
lackeys
to
mind
horses
but
we
have
neither
at
least
we
are
given
no
honorable
service
for
my
part
i
do
as
i
am
told
said
stefan
and
you
be
wise
to
do
the
same
that
young
comrade
of
yours
is
capable
of
looking
after
himself
anton
looked
at
the
soldier
curiously
for
a
moment
but
thoughts
were
always
difficult
to
read
his
face
never
showed
a
sign
of
any
meaning
beyond
the
words
he
uttered
following
the
three
brigands
the
others
climbed
up
the
slope
of
the
landslip
which
had
filled
up
the
pass
it
was
uneven
ground
and
they
were
soon
hidden
from
their
companions
with
the
horses
descending
presently
into
a
ravine
the
brigands
stopped
as
a
careful
captain
you
will
appreciate
the
caution
of
our
chief
said
the
spokesman
turning
to
ellerey
we
were
ordered
to
bring
you
no
farther
than
this
he
will
come
to
you
here
we
are
only
eight
let
him
come
with
no
larger
following
ellerey
answered
there
shall
be
precaution
on
both
sides
i
will
give
your
message
but
unless
he
fulfils
my
terms
i
depart
the
way
i
have
come
and
make
my
terms
in
the
shadow
of
the
castle
yonder
i
will
tell
him
so
said
the
man
and
the
brigands
went
quickly
up
the
ravine
and
disappeared
this
is
their
vantage
ground
said
ellerey
stand
apart
all
of
you
near
enough
to
help
each
other
but
not
in
each
other
way
should
a
rush
come
grigosie
stand
there
carelessly
as
it
were
but
with
ready
fingers
we
have
no
knowledge
of
the
honor
of
these
men
they
had
not
long
to
wait
from
the
bend
in
the
ravine
came
three
men
the
central
figure
a
man
of
great
stature
he
walked
proudly
with
long
swaggering
strides
and
swinging
arms
his
long
black
hair
bearded
chin
and
beady
eyes
set
under
heavy
eyebrows
gave
a
ferocity
to
his
appearance
which
ellerey
did
not
find
attractive
he
looked
like
a
man
in
whom
the
barbarian
was
still
active
whose
laws
of
right
and
wrong
and
honor
were
likely
to
be
of
his
own
fashioning
one
in
whom
it
would
be
dangerous
to
trust
too
implicitly
yet
he
was
a
striking
and
a
handsome
figure
and
his
dress
gave
him
distinction
a
scarlet
feather
was
in
his
hat
and
he
wore
a
scarlet
cloak
which
the
weather
had
stained
a
heavy
knife
was
stuck
in
his
belt
and
it
was
obvious
that
his
companions
treated
him
with
marked
respect
is
this
bravado
or
does
he
know
that
a
hundred
pairs
of
eyes
are
watching
us
said
ellerey
grigosie
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
the
three
men
he
stood
in
a
careless
attitude
one
hand
resting
on
his
hip
the
other
thrust
into
his
breast
and
his
fingers
were
upon
a
revolver
no
gesture
of
the
men
escaped
him
and
long
before
they
came
to
a
standstill
in
front
of
ellerey
he
had
learned
their
features
thoroughly
the
big
man
gave
a
short
salute
rather
as
acknowledging
an
inferior
than
answering
an
equal
you
have
a
message
for
me
captain
i
can
answer
that
question
when
i
know
who
you
are
said
ellerey
the
big
man
laughed
with
a
glance
at
his
companions
who
laughed
too
pleased
to
humor
him
you
are
a
stranger
in
these
hills
or
you
would
know
me
i
am
vasilici
he
did
not
call
himself
great
but
his
manner
easily
filled
the
omission
he
glanced
at
ellerey
and
at
the
soldiers
to
see
the
effect
of
his
words
then
i
have
a
message
for
you
from
queen
elena
it
has
been
so
long
in
coming
that
i
have
almost
grown
tired
of
waiting
vasilici
answered
i
presume
she
would
have
done
without
my
help
if
she
could
i
am
only
the
bearer
of
one
message
ellerey
said
shortly
the
fellow
insolent
manner
came
near
to
raising
ellerey
temper
this
was
a
dangerous
ally
the
queen
had
chosen
do
you
know
the
nature
of
the
message
i
bring
aye
as
i
know
the
price
to
be
paid
for
my
help
the
queen
has
not
dared
to
question
my
terms
has
she
i
know
nothing
of
the
price
i
might
find
it
too
high
if
i
did
nor
were
you
sent
to
argue
captain
but
to
deliver
the
token
said
vasilici
holding
out
his
hand
ellerey
swallowed
his
rages
a
best
he
could
with
a
determination
to
take
the
pride
out
of
this
boaster
some
day
and
drawing
out
the
sealed
box
containing
the
bracelet
of
medallions
handed
it
to
the
brigand
at
last
the
great
day
dawns
for
me
and
for
wallaria
vasilici
exclaimed
the
kingdom
of
the
hills
comes
to
power
and
honor
did
they
tell
you
that
an
army
lies
in
wait
between
here
and
sturatzberg
asked
ellerey
fifty
armies
will
not
stop
me
and
those
i
lead
when
i
elect
to
strike
cried
the
brigand
snapping
his
fingers
the
puppets
in
sturatzberg
will
either
bow
to
me
or
squeal
at
their
punishment
when
i
enter
the
city
you
find
the
gates
shut
and
some
good
men
to
guard
them
ellerey
answered
i
am
in
a
position
to
know
that
we
may
use
you
captain
and
for
good
service
there
is
something
more
than
thanks
ellerey
laughed
loudly
it
was
the
only
way
he
could
prevent
himself
from
cursing
this
insolent
scoundrel
he
almost
despised
himself
for
being
even
in
the
same
cause
with
this
swaggerer
for
a
moment
grigosie
glanced
at
him
understanding
something
of
what
was
in
his
mind
but
the
next
instant
he
had
turned
again
to
watch
vasilici
the
man
was
a
swaggerer
through
and
through
although
if
the
tales
told
of
him
were
true
he
did
not
lack
courage
he
had
for
a
long
time
impressed
his
followers
with
his
bluster
and
attitudes
playing
a
carefully
studied
part
before
them
appealing
to
that
vein
of
romance
which
life
in
the
mountains
had
fostered
in
them
and
he
played
the
part
now
for
the
benefit
of
ellerey
and
his
comrades
falling
into
a
pose
he
turned
the
box
this
way
and
that
as
though
the
opening
of
it
were
a
supreme
thing
which
a
little
delay
would
materially
add
to
then
with
a
flourish
he
drew
the
knife
from
his
belt
and
broke
the
seals
pausing
again
to
carefully
replace
the
knife
freedom
to
this
wretched
land
at
last
he
said
and
so
i
open
the
queen
token
the
box
fell
to
the
ground
with
the
packing
it
had
contained
and
then
with
an
oath
vasilici
drew
himself
to
his
full
height
one
hand
upon
the
haft
of
his
knife
in
a
moment
is
this
how
her
majesty
attempts
to
fool
me
he
cried
ellerey
took
a
step
forward
to
look
and
an
oath
burst
from
his
lips
too
it
was
not
the
iron
bracelet
of
medallions
which
vasilici
held
up
but
a
cross
of
gold
curious
in
shape
and
workmanship
upon
which
the
sun
glinted
as
it
swung
by
its
little
chain
in
the
brigand
hand
chapter
xv
the
race
for
life
the
action
a
man
will
take
in
a
crisis
is
exceedingly
difficult
to
gauge
beforehand
as
a
rule
such
moments
happen
from
a
chain
of
circumstances
which
the
man
has
not
foreseen
and
therefore
has
made
no
preparation
to
meet
and
his
conduct
is
likely
to
be
guided
entirely
by
the
attitude
of
those
about
him
without
any
question
of
right
or
wrong
without
a
thought
of
what
has
occurred
in
the
past
or
what
may
happen
in
the
future
this
was
ellerey
position
he
had
expected
to
see
the
bracelet
of
medallions
instead
he
saw
a
golden
cross
he
knew
that
in
some
manner
he
had
been
deceived
and
who
but
the
queen
could
have
placed
this
unexpected
token
in
his
keeping
by
his
manner
he
knew
that
the
golden
cross
held
some
meaning
for
the
brigand
a
meaning
of
which
ellerey
was
absolutely
ignorant
and
under
other
conditions
he
might
have
admitted
his
ignorance
and
entered
into
explanations
as
it
was
the
whole
bearing
of
vasilici
his
bluster
and
his
swagger
had
roused
ellerey
anger
he
had
felt
that
the
man
was
a
crafty
enemy
even
at
the
moment
of
delivering
what
he
supposed
to
be
a
friendly
message
and
the
keen
desire
to
show
his
contempt
for
him
had
made
his
tongue
smart
with
unspoken
words
and
his
hands
tingle
to
be
clenched
and
to
strike
he
had
forced
himself
to
decent
speech
and
attitude
but
now
his
anger
asserted
itself
no
question
of
duty
or
expediency
seemed
to
bind
him
only
a
boastful
enemy
was
before
him
to
be
answered
in
the
same
fashion
as
he
questioned
and
if
that
did
not
suffice
to
be
punished
as
he
merited
that
is
the
token
as
i
received
it
said
ellerey
as
the
brigand
had
held
up
the
token
grigosie
had
leant
forward
to
see
it
the
color
mounting
into
his
cheeks
now
his
enthusiasm
appeared
to
get
the
better
of
his
prudence
and
he
cried
out
long
live
our
country
down
with
all
who
dishonor
her
the
golden
cross
gleams
in
the
light
of
god
good
sun
it
is
a
benediction
on
this
day
a
promise
of
brighter
days
to
follow
summon
your
legions
vasilici
and
on
to
sturatzberg
where
the
hornets
are
nesting
ready
for
destruction
the
brigand
glanced
at
the
boy
contemptuously
what
bantam
is
this
you
have
brought
to
crow
for
you
the
boy
speaks
well
enough
said
ellerey
there
is
the
token
where
is
your
answer
here
and
here
was
the
quick
answer
as
he
hurled
the
cross
high
into
the
air
behind
him
and
at
the
same
time
blew
a
shrill
whistle
that
is
vasilici
answer
to
liars
and
this
his
swift
punishment
the
man
movements
were
so
lithe
and
quick
so
utterly
unexpected
that
he
had
sprung
upon
ellerey
before
the
words
had
fully
left
his
lips
the
long
blade
of
his
knife
caught
the
sunlight
even
as
the
golden
cross
had
caught
it
a
moment
ago
and
ellerey
upraised
arm
alone
protected
his
breast
from
the
downward
thrust
but
the
swift
stroke
did
not
come
a
revolver
shot
awoke
the
echoes
of
the
hills
and
with
a
howl
the
great
brigand
leapt
backward
his
knife
falling
harmlessly
to
the
ground
and
his
arm
useless
to
his
side
the
bantam
answer
cried
grigosie
to
me
captain
it
was
at
once
evident
that
vasilici
had
not
ventured
to
the
interview
without
support
the
hills
in
front
of
them
were
immediately
alive
with
men
scrambling
downward
to
the
very
ground
the
little
band
occupied
men
were
in
the
ravine
behind
them
rushing
up
to
cut
off
retreat
that
way
cries
and
shouting
were
on
every
side
some
calling
for
surrender
others
shouting
that
the
soldiers
had
been
deceived
by
their
captain
in
the
sudden
confusion
ellerey
gave
quick
commands
as
with
sword
in
hand
he
sprang
to
the
rising
ground
where
grigosie
stood
but
his
orders
were
either
not
heard
or
came
too
late
for
obedience
before
the
soldiers
could
come
to
him
the
brigands
were
between
them
it
is
madness
to
stay
whispered
grigosie
the
hill
behind
us
is
clear
the
boy
fired
twice
in
quick
succession
at
men
who
had
raised
their
rifles
ready
to
fire
at
them
and
although
in
answer
a
dozen
bullets
sang
past
them
the
aim
was
faulty
in
the
excitement
shoot
them
both
was
the
shout
shoot
them
thundered
vasilici
come
whispered
grigosie
they
scrambled
upward
together
the
unevenness
of
the
hillside
protecting
them
for
a
moment
from
the
flying
bullets
i
marked
our
direction
said
grigosie
we
can
keep
to
this
kind
path
for
a
little
way
and
with
luck
cross
the
open
presently
toward
the
horses
they
ran
on
crouching
lest
their
heads
should
be
seen
and
mark
the
direction
they
had
taken
grigosie
refilled
the
empty
chambers
of
his
revolver
as
he
went
and
ellerey
put
up
his
sword
and
took
his
revolver
instead
behind
them
the
firing
had
ceased
but
they
could
not
doubt
that
they
were
being
swiftly
followed
and
spread
over
the
open
which
they
must
needs
cross
a
hundred
men
probably
barred
their
way
unless
they
were
already
there
when
we
passed
they
will
hardly
have
time
to
intercept
us
was
grigosie
answer
to
this
fear
probably
they
were
there
lad
said
ellerey
we
about
an
equal
chance
with
the
hare
that
is
being
coursed
he
gets
away
sometimes
was
the
answer
they
ran
swiftly
mounting
higher
and
higher
as
they
went
once
they
caught
sight
of
men
running
in
the
path
below
them
and
presently
of
others
climbing
the
hillside
to
reach
the
summit
before
them
but
no
shout
told
them
that
they
themselves
had
been
seen
do
fire
grigosie
unless
it
is
absolutely
necessary
said
ellerey
it
would
betray
our
whereabouts
and
we
shall
want
all
our
cartridges
to
stop
them
across
the
open
the
boy
nodded
and
ran
on
the
top
at
last
he
exclaimed
that
height
yonder
is
our
mark
if
we
can
reach
it
we
shall
be
in
sight
of
the
horses
how
far
behind
have
we
left
them
he
stood
for
a
moment
to
look
back
along
the
ridge
under
which
they
had
come
some
distance
away
men
were
coming
into
view
quick
grigosie
it
speed
now
said
ellerey
the
way
before
them
was
clear
and
they
ran
side
by
side
careful
of
their
steps
lest
a
hole
might
mean
a
fall
and
a
sprained
ankle
presently
a
bullet
passed
between
them
and
they
began
to
run
in
fashion
to
puzzle
the
marksmanship
ellerey
constantly
turned
to
look
back
there
were
many
pursuers
some
widely
straggling
but
a
few
of
them
were
gaining
rapidly
these
did
not
pause
to
fire
they
ran
judging
their
pace
and
distance
to
a
nicety
long
before
the
point
for
which
the
fugitives
were
making
could
be
reached
these
men
would
be
upon
them
we
must
stop
them
grigosie
the
lad
looked
back
he
was
beginning
to
pant
heavily
not
yet
he
said
they
are
not
close
enough
so
they
ran
on
it
was
evident
to
ellerey
that
the
boy
pace
was
palpably
slackening
and
there
was
yet
some
distance
to
cover
to
the
height
to
say
nothing
of
the
final
dash
for
the
horses
the
men
behind
were
rapidly
overtaking
them
ellerey
could
hear
the
dull
rhythmic
pad
of
the
running
feet
twelve
paces
grigosie
he
murmured
then
turn
sharply
do
not
kill
lame
them
their
companions
may
stop
to
help
them
ellerey
counted
the
twelve
paces
aloud
and
then
they
both
turned
four
shots
rang
out
sharply
and
three
of
the
foremost
runners
stumbled
and
fell
an
answering
bullet
cut
through
ellerey
coat
sleeve
and
there
was
the
pain
as
of
a
hot
skewer
laid
for
a
moment
on
his
flesh
as
he
and
grigosie
ran
on
again
every
step
lessens
the
distance
lad
he
said
encouragingly
that
will
teach
them
to
keep
a
little
farther
in
the
rear
still
ellerey
turned
constantly
to
watch
their
pursuers
one
or
two
had
stopped
by
their
wounded
companions
but
the
rest
held
on
their
way
undeterred
by
the
fate
of
their
comrades
twice
again
did
ellerey
count
twelve
paces
and
he
and
grigosie
turned
together
and
fired
the
foremost
runner
on
the
last
occasion
was
grigosie
mark
and
he
missed
him
the
man
had
bounded
forward
to
make
his
capture
when
revolver
sounded
again
it
was
not
the
moment
to
hazard
a
shot
to
aim
at
the
swiftly
moving
limbs
the
man
leapt
into
the
air
and
fell
sprawling
on
his
face
and
with
one
spasmodic
kick
lay
still
grigosie
turned
and
ran
on
again
without
a
word
they
were
close
to
the
height
now
it
was
to
their
left
and
the
boy
pointed
to
a
depression
which
lay
between
it
and
another
elevation
the
way
was
narrow
which
was
in
their
favor
and
if
only
the
brigands
were
not
in
force
on
the
other
side
and
grigosie
had
made
no
mistake
in
the
direction
there
was
a
chance
of
escape
ellerey
let
grigosie
enter
the
narrow
way
first
and
then
paused
in
the
entrance
only
two
men
followed
them
and
seeing
ellerey
stop
they
fired
ellerey
fired
twice
in
answer
and
without
waiting
to
see
if
the
shots
had
taken
effect
dashed
after
grigosie
the
boy
had
made
no
mistake
they
had
come
out
down
the
rising
ground
which
they
had
climbed
directly
after
dismounting
below
them
stood
stefan
and
anton
with
the
horses
and
higher
up
the
slope
above
them
more
of
the
brigands
were
hastily
descending
some
of
the
men
had
gone
this
way
to
cut
off
their
retreat
and
the
fugitives
had
not
a
moment
to
waste
in
their
final
dash
for
freedom
ellerey
fired
into
the
air
to
put
stefan
on
the
alert
and
seizing
grigosie
arm
for
the
boy
was
nearly
beaten
he
dashed
down
the
steep
incline
stefan
saw
them
and
spoke
quickly
to
anton
who
for
a
moment
seemed
inclined
to
lose
his
head
the
soldier
sharp
command
steadied
him
and
the
moment
grigosie
was
beside
him
he
lifted
him
bodily
into
the
saddle
and
then
sprang
to
his
own
no
others
stefan
shouted
wheeling
ellerey
horse
round
toward
him
no
without
a
word
stefan
cast
loose
the
reins
of
the
other
horses
and
the
next
instant
the
four
riders
were
galloping
for
dear
life
up
the
pass
ellerey
and
grigosie
in
the
centre
anton
and
stefan
on
either
side
knee
to
knee
they
galloped
their
bodies
low
upon
their
necks
several
shots
followed
them
but
went
wide
of
the
mark
and
a
bend
in
the
pass
soon
covered
them
still
they
held
on
their
way
speaking
no
word
there
was
only
the
sound
of
the
rapidly
beating
hoofs
and
the
rough
purring
of
the
leather
as
the
legs
rubbed
the
saddles
ellerey
thought
that
along
the
pass
any
surprise
or
ambush
was
impossible
he
had
taken
careful
notice
of
the
mountain
walls
which
shut
them
in
but
he
was
not
so
satisfied
that
they
would
find
the
castle
open
to
them
those
who
occupied
it
if
any
were
there
could
hardly
have
heard
of
the
failure
of
the
meeting
yet
and
he
therefore
hoped
that
he
might
gain
possession
of
it
by
stratagem
to
ride
out
of
the
pass
would
be
madness
with
the
armies
from
sturatzberg
guarding
the
plain
the
castle
was
their
only
hope
their
place
of
refuge
as
grigosie
had
prophetically
called
it
ellerey
drew
rein
presently
we
have
distanced
them
he
said
what
do
you
think
stefan
will
the
castle
be
empty
the
soldier
shrugged
his
shoulders
if
any
brigands
still
occupy
the
hills
about
it
they
can
not
know
that
our
mission
has
failed
these
fellows
manage
to
signal
very
quickly
to
one
another
stefan
answered
then
we
must
fight
for
its
possession
it
is
our
only
chance
our
chance
is
a
poor
one
if
it
comes
to
fighting
said
stefan
we
will
try
strategy
first
ellerey
said
let
us
ride
easily
what
happened
queried
stefan
the
box
did
not
contain
the
right
token
and
they
attacked
us
without
a
word
of
warning
what
of
the
others
heaven
knows
they
hardly
seemed
to
strike
a
blow
after
we
were
surrounded
it
was
grigosie
who
thought
of
the
way
across
the
hills
and
we
had
to
run
for
it
like
hunted
rabbits
eh
lad
grigosie
smiled
faintly
but
did
not
speak
he
was
still
panting
after
his
tremendous
exertion
anton
had
stretched
out
a
hand
to
support
him
in
his
saddle
as
they
galloped
they
are
dead
then
those
others
said
stefan
i
fear
so
and
we
been
deceived
sent
into
a
trap
like
a
lot
of
rats
a
reckoning
to
be
paid
time
enough
to
think
of
that
stefan
let
us
secure
the
castle
first
said
ellerey
i
fearing
the
reckoning
must
be
left
for
others
to
pay
growled
the
soldier
it
putting
our
trust
in
a
woman
that
been
the
curse
of
us
no
one
contradicted
him
and
they
rode
on
in
silence
until
the
castle
came
in
view
it
looked
gaunt
enough
as
silent
and
deserted
as
when
they
had
first
seen
it
there
was
no
movement
on
the
plateau
no
sign
that
any
living
creature
except
themselves
was
near
it
look
exclaimed
stefan
suddenly
he
pointed
to
the
hillside
on
which
the
lights
had
shone
mysteriously
last
night
here
and
there
were
moving
figures
descending
the
slopes
whether
they
had
caught
sight
of
the
riders
and
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
something
was
wrong
or
whether
they
had
learnt
of
the
escape
from
signals
across
the
hills
it
was
impossible
to
say
at
any
rate
they
were
descending
rapidly
and
there
was
no
time
to
lose
once
in
the
path
the
odds
will
be
more
evenly
balanced
said
ellerey
forward
gallop
it
seems
to
me
they
are
making
for
a
point
beyond
the
castle
said
stefan
they
are
expecting
us
to
ride
out
of
the
pass
so
fortune
favors
us
said
ellerey
rein
up
altogether
at
the
entrance
to
the
path
dismount
and
up
to
the
plateau
quickly
even
as
they
stopped
with
exact
precision
a
loud
challenge
came
from
the
opposite
hill
and
no
answer
being
given
several
shots
whistled
across
the
pass
and
struck
close
to
the
entrance
of
the
way
up
with
you
quickly
shouted
ellerey
who
brought
up
the
rear
there
is
little
harm
in
such
firing
and
they
will
think
twice
before
they
follow
us
careful
in
front
lad
stefan
called
out
to
grigosie
who
led
the
way
keep
sharp
eyes
the
plateau
may
be
occupied
the
boy
nodded
but
he
had
been
looking
out
keenly
before
the
warning
leading
his
horse
in
such
a
manner
as
to
cover
himself
as
much
as
possible
the
precaution
proved
unnecessary
the
castle
was
empty
stefan
was
right
the
brigands
had
not
expected
the
fugitives
to
make
for
their
old
resting
place
and
when
they
saw
them
go
up
the
path
they
shouted
as
though
victory
were
already
won
nor
did
they
attempt
to
follow
them
why
should
they
their
foes
were
caught
surely
as
birds
netted
by
the
fowler
see
to
the
horses
grigosie
said
ellerey
put
them
as
far
back
in
the
ruins
as
possible
now
stefan
anton
we
heap
stones
across
this
broken
gateway
at
the
head
of
the
path
it
shall
be
our
first
line
of
defence
and
if
it
is
taken
we
will
see
to
it
that
it
is
dearly
bought
it
is
not
the
fighting
that
frightens
me
it
the
empty
condition
of
the
larder
said
stefan
truly
we
are
pariahs
on
god
earth
ellerey
answered
every
hand
against
us
but
we
snarl
and
bite
awhile
in
our
stronghold
and
then
make
a
dash
out
and
die
in
the
open
they
toiled
with
a
will
all
through
the
afternoon
heaping
fragments
which
had
fallen
from
the
ruins
across
the
gateway
and
driving
in
stakes
rudely
fashioned
from
any
planks
they
could
find
behind
the
stonework
to
strengthen
it
grigosie
by
ellerey
orders
did
not
assist
in
this
work
but
stood
sentinel
upon
the
plateau
the
boy
had
had
as
much
as
he
could
stand
for
one
day
it
was
growing
dusk
in
the
pass
below
when
they
had
finished
daylight
was
still
upon
the
summit
of
the
mountains
but
twilight
had
gathered
in
the
deep
valleys
and
ravines
the
brigands
still
hung
about
the
pass
watching
the
castle
but
keeping
out
of
range
it
did
not
appear
that
they
had
any
intention
of
attacking
it
as
they
stood
together
looking
down
upon
their
enemies
ellerey
told
stefan
what
had
happened
and
the
details
of
their
escape
surely
those
are
our
fellows
captain
but
there
was
no
tone
of
pleasure
at
the
escape
of
his
comrades
no
note
of
welcome
in
the
soldier
voice
this
looks
like
desertion
said
ellerey
one
of
the
soldiers
below
called
out
in
a
stentorian
voice
which
carried
clearly
in
the
quiet
air
ho
there
stefan
well
comrade
we
betrayed
by
that
devilish
englishman
is
he
there
with
you
the
captain
is
here
what
of
him
throw
him
down
to
us
along
with
the
boy
was
the
answer
shouted
back
he
tricked
us
all
and
that
imp
of
satan
has
helped
him
the
token
he
carried
was
not
from
her
majesty
he
a
conspirator
against
the
king
and
carried
the
golden
cross
you
know
what
that
means
throw
him
down
it
were
easier
for
you
to
show
your
courage
and
come
and
fetch
him
our
good
friends
here
will
do
that
we
have
other
work
in
hand
we
ride
back
to
sturatzberg
to
tell
our
story
and
heaven
help
you
if
you
are
alive
when
we
return
there
be
little
mercy
for
the
companions
of
that
devilish
englishman
will
you
come
with
us
i
too
old
to
run
away
shouted
stefan
and
the
company
of
cowards
is
not
to
my
liking
may
they
cut
your
throats
on
the
plain
yonder
and
ask
for
your
story
afterward
the
brigands
yelled
with
rage
and
the
soldiers
shouted
back
coarse
oaths
it
would
do
my
soul
good
to
have
a
shot
at
them
said
stefan
let
them
go
said
ellerey
we
shall
want
every
shot
we
have
we
are
not
without
friends
in
the
capital
who
may
hear
of
our
need
against
their
will
these
fellows
may
help
us
the
soldiers
below
moved
on
it
was
evident
that
here
they
were
to
part
with
the
brigands
hold
them
fast
for
punishment
cried
the
same
stentorian
voice
we
shall
return
with
the
true
message
down
with
all
lovers
of
the
golden
cross
death
to
them
who
serve
maritza
down
with
maritza
what
is
that
they
shout
said
ellerey
the
answer
came
loudly
borne
upward
on
the
air
as
the
soldiers
put
their
horses
into
a
canter
and
rode
down
the
pass
death
to
the
princess
maritza
you
hear
captain
some
one
has
fooled
us
all
princess
maritza
ellerey
exclaimed
what
has
she
to
do
with
us
sufficient
to
give
us
a
violent
ending
stefan
answered
the
golden
cross
is
the
sign
of
her
house
her
token
and
you
captain
have
been
her
messenger
chapter
xvi
the
traitor
a
smile
wrinkled
stefan
face
not
of
amusement
at
the
deception
which
had
been
practised
upon
them
but
in
expectation
of
disappointed
rage
from
ellerey
with
diplomacy
and
the
fine
points
of
strategy
stefan
the
soldier
had
little
to
do
his
business
was
fighting
it
was
his
livelihood
and
some
day
near
or
far
in
the
future
as
fate
decreed
it
would
be
his
death
his
respect
for
his
fellows
was
measured
by
their
power
of
withstanding
him
and
the
man
he
had
the
greatest
affection
for
perhaps
was
a
soldier
now
incapacitated
who
had
once
in
a
melee
succeeded
in
knocking
him
from
his
saddle
at
the
same
time
he
believed
in
his
own
astuteness
not
without
some
reason
be
it
said
and
in
the
back
of
his
mind
there
was
always
a
certain
admiration
for
the
man
who
could
get
the
better
of
him
it
is
more
than
possible
that
if
he
ever
married
he
would
thoroughly
respect
his
wife
on
account
of
her
cleverness
in
having
hoodwinked
him
into
marrying
her
but
the
burst
of
anger
did
not
come
ellerey
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
point
in
the
pass
round
which
the
soldiers
had
disappeared
and
for
some
minutes
he
did
not
speak
what
is
done
must
remain
as
it
is
he
said
at
last
we
have
only
ourselves
to
consider
now
we
must
watch
two
and
two
one
on
the
plateau
one
at
the
path
anton
and
you
stefan
grigosie
and
i
short
rations
for
us
and
careful
use
of
cartridges
we
must
understand
how
our
enemy
is
going
to
conduct
this
siege
before
we
calculate
our
chances
what
ammunition
have
we
it
was
little
enough
that
the
four
of
them
could
display
if
every
cartridge
accounted
for
a
man
small
damage
would
be
done
to
their
foes
i
flung
a
belt
of
cartridges
in
a
corner
of
the
tower
before
we
left
said
grigosie
they
all
turned
to
look
at
him
did
you
fling
some
food
into
a
corner
too
asked
stefan
no
but
i
marked
that
birds
used
the
plateau
in
the
early
morning
grigosie
answered
they
be
coming
in
larger
numbers
presently
and
maybe
get
a
good
picking
off
the
four
of
us
said
stefan
you
have
happened
upon
a
fountain
of
wine
have
you
that
too
is
supplied
stefan
you
can
hear
it
leaping
down
the
and
see
it
too
and
the
boy
pointed
to
a
corner
of
the
plateau
which
was
within
reach
of
the
narrow
stream
which
from
the
heights
fell
with
many
a
cascade
into
the
pass
beneath
stefan
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
said
in
disgust
water
and
birds
fairies
fodder
it
might
be
worse
said
anton
wait
a
day
or
two
comrade
and
you
be
crying
a
different
tale
said
stefan
although
for
that
matter
the
food
will
doubtless
last
our
time
had
we
in
our
small
circle
here
half
a
dozen
taverns
filled
from
cellar
floor
to
garret
ceiling
those
fellows
yonder
would
give
us
little
chance
of
visiting
them
keep
watch
here
anton
i
go
to
the
gate
we
rest
grigosie
said
ellerey
the
boy
turned
and
entered
the
tower
but
ellerey
did
not
follow
him
at
once
he
paced
in
and
out
the
ruined
walls
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
deep
in
thought
and
troubled
who
had
deceived
him
it
could
only
be
the
queen
or
the
man
who
had
brought
him
the
token
or
perhaps
de
froilette
indeed
they
might
all
be
in
a
conspiracy
to
deceive
him
yet
why
should
the
queen
desire
to
deliver
the
token
of
princess
maritza
house
to
the
brigands
how
could
it
serve
her
ends
de
froilette
position
and
political
aims
were
less
clear
ellerey
had
never
believed
him
heart
whole
in
his
devotion
to
her
majesty
yet
surely
he
would
have
taken
the
precaution
to
find
out
how
such
a
token
would
be
received
before
sending
it
he
was
not
the
man
to
risk
the
work
of
years
without
some
real
hope
of
success
then
ellerey
thoughts
turned
to
the
woman
who
had
craved
his
help
in
the
altstrasse
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
searched
for
the
token
the
masked
woman
who
had
come
to
look
upon
him
and
the
warning
she
had
given
him
baron
petrescu
too
had
probably
forced
the
duel
upon
him
because
of
the
token
believing
that
it
had
been
delivered
to
him
that
night
by
the
queen
at
his
interview
with
her
majesty
the
token
which
had
been
decided
upon
was
the
bracelet
of
medallions
it
was
hardly
likely
that
it
would
be
suddenly
changed
somehow
the
bracelet
had
been
filched
from
the
sealed
box
and
the
golden
cross
placed
there
instead
ellerey
decided
that
the
power
to
effect
this
change
lay
only
with
the
man
who
had
brought
him
the
token
and
on
this
man
he
fixed
the
blame
whoever
was
responsible
for
it
the
scheme
had
failed
miserably
and
it
was
difficult
to
see
how
success
could
ever
have
been
hoped
for
on
the
other
hand
it
could
hardly
be
supposed
that
all
those
who
followed
the
fortunes
of
the
golden
cross
were
fools
acting
upon
sudden
impulse
courting
disaster
they
must
have
had
some
reason
for
believing
that
the
token
would
receive
some
consideration
from
the
brigands
and
those
who
had
gathered
to
their
standard
possibly
they
had
themselves
been
deceived
even
as
they
had
attempted
to
deceive
ellerey
could
not
doubt
that
princess
maritza
had
a
considerable
following
in
sturatzberg
that
the
seeds
of
the
rebellion
were
widely
scattered
the
soldiers
now
riding
toward
the
capital
would
spread
the
news
of
failure
and
the
rebellion
in
might
be
forced
to
break
into
open
conflict
at
once
even
then
would
maritza
followers
give
a
thought
to
the
remnant
of
the
band
who
had
carried
the
message
if
countess
mavrodin
had
a
voice
in
their
councils
as
surely
she
must
have
they
might
the
chance
of
rescue
was
a
slender
one
but
a
hope
did
exist
strange
to
say
anger
at
the
trick
which
had
been
played
upon
him
did
not
assert
itself
in
any
great
degree
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
all
hope
of
honor
and
advancement
was
now
at
an
end
vasilici
attitude
had
doubtless
something
to
do
with
ellerey
state
of
mind
personal
antagonism
rising
above
ambition
but
this
would
not
have
been
the
case
probably
had
ellerey
been
forced
against
his
will
into
any
other
service
than
that
of
princess
maritza
there
was
a
charm
for
him
in
her
name
the
memory
of
her
had
dwelt
with
him
and
lent
a
halo
of
romance
to
his
present
position
he
saw
her
again
with
her
hair
streaming
in
the
breeze
and
felt
again
the
subtle
strength
and
vigor
that
were
in
her
had
he
not
thought
then
that
it
would
be
good
to
fight
in
her
cause
why
should
he
rage
at
the
circumstances
which
had
forced
him
into
it
when
he
entered
the
tower
grigosie
was
asleep
and
he
lay
down
to
snatch
what
rest
he
could
before
relieving
anton
and
stefan
when
they
went
on
duty
grigosie
watched
by
the
path
ellerey
on
the
plateau
they
will
wait
for
vasilici
stefan
said
when
he
reported
that
all
had
been
quiet
so
far
ellerey
paced
up
and
down
pausing
at
short
intervals
to
listen
not
a
sound
broke
the
deep
silence
the
great
world
seemed
to
lie
still
and
motionless
under
the
glow
of
the
moonlit
night
and
the
pale
glimmer
of
the
stars
it
was
a
time
to
dream
of
life
and
realized
ambition
not
to
ponder
on
lurking
death
and
failure
he
walked
presently
to
the
head
of
the
path
your
castle
has
proved
a
refuge
after
all
grigosie
how
came
you
to
be
prophetic
i
did
not
believe
my
own
prophecy
yet
you
hid
the
cartridges
believing
perhaps
that
they
would
never
be
wanted
grigosie
answered
i
am
full
of
strange
thoughts
and
superstitions
captain
and
can
not
talk
it
is
the
moon
and
the
stars
grigosie
madmen
time
when
everything
is
distorted
answered
the
lad
and
lovers
time
too
grigosie
which
are
you
madman
or
lover
a
little
of
both
i
think
ellerey
answered
and
below
us
death
is
waiting
said
grigosie
i
do
think
death
is
coming
to
us
this
time
replied
ellerey
the
boy
did
not
answer
several
times
during
those
watching
hours
ellerey
went
to
the
head
of
the
path
but
grigosie
never
spoke
never
turned
to
him
his
thoughts
and
superstitions
occupied
him
and
with
the
light
of
day
ellerey
noticed
that
there
was
something
in
his
face
which
was
new
he
had
changed
during
the
night
something
was
it
his
courage
seemed
to
have
left
him
but
in
its
place
there
had
come
an
addition
to
him
to
his
expression
almost
to
his
character
ellerey
fancied
he
watched
the
lad
enter
the
tower
saw
him
cast
himself
wearily
into
his
corner
and
would
have
followed
him
had
not
stefan
detained
him
i
was
right
captain
vasilici
is
coming
they
are
gathering
in
the
pass
waiting
for
him
a
little
later
a
shout
proclaimed
the
arrival
of
the
chief
and
ellerey
saw
his
huge
frame
in
the
midst
of
his
followers
his
right
hand
was
swathed
in
a
handkerchief
and
rested
in
a
sling
and
savage
ferocity
was
in
his
face
as
he
looked
up
toward
the
castle
his
orders
and
he
appeared
to
give
many
were
promptly
obeyed
and
he
struck
one
man
viciously
perhaps
because
he
dared
to
offer
advice
unasked
it
was
evidence
of
his
power
among
them
that
no
one
interfered
nor
did
the
victim
himself
retaliate
men
began
to
climb
the
opposite
slopes
while
others
massed
themselves
at
the
foot
of
the
pass
they
are
going
to
attack
us
at
once
captain
said
stefan
it
is
to
be
hot
work
for
us
at
the
head
of
the
path
the
little
band
of
defenders
waited
every
shot
must
tell
ellerey
whispered
and
keep
well
behind
the
stonework
all
of
you
the
path
was
narrow
with
deep
sides
the
brigands
came
up
it
boldly
enough
until
the
last
bend
in
it
showed
them
the
gateway
then
they
halted
and
the
foremost
leaned
back
upon
those
behind
who
pushed
them
on
and
shouted
forward
two
men
fired
blindly
at
the
stone
wall
and
then
rushed
upon
it
never
to
reach
their
goal
only
two
shots
rang
out
but
both
men
threw
up
their
arms
and
staggered
backward
upon
their
companions
not
more
than
two
abreast
could
come
up
the
narrow
way
and
twice
again
a
speedy
death
crowned
the
temerity
of
those
who
rushed
to
the
attack
those
behind
shouted
to
be
let
up
to
the
front
and
those
before
made
every
effort
to
let
them
come
the
spirit
of
the
brigands
seemed
to
die
out
of
them
as
their
eyes
fell
upon
their
dead
companions
and
that
silent
barricade
then
one
fellow
suddenly
picked
up
a
corpse
and
holding
it
before
him
as
a
shield
dashed
forward
with
a
shout
let
him
come
whispered
ellerey
shoot
at
those
who
follow
the
man
rushed
to
the
wall
until
the
dead
body
struck
the
stonework
success
for
a
moment
seemed
to
be
his
he
had
plugged
one
narrow
slit
through
which
the
bullets
came
and
he
cheered
his
comrades
on
they
came
but
only
to
have
their
leader
fall
back
into
their
arms
through
the
slit
ellerey
had
driven
his
sword
with
all
his
strength
piercing
the
living
through
the
dead
it
had
been
an
ugly
rush
but
for
the
present
it
was
the
last
they
try
some
other
plan
before
attempting
this
way
again
said
stefan
is
there
any
other
way
grigosie
asked
for
mountaineers
there
may
be
these
fellows
can
walk
in
places
where
we
should
never
venture
and
only
expect
to
find
flies
from
the
opposite
mountain
a
desultory
fire
was
maintained
upon
the
plateau
which
could
only
do
harm
if
the
defenders
were
careless
for
the
rest
of
the
day
the
brigands
held
aloof
standing
or
sitting
in
parties
in
the
pass
and
watching
the
castle
vasilici
strode
from
one
group
to
another
but
no
movement
followed
there
was
no
sleep
for
the
defenders
that
night
and
at
dawn
in
spite
of
stefan
forecast
another
attack
was
made
upon
the
gate
it
was
as
unsuccessful
as
the
first
nor
was
it
made
with
such
determination
the
obedience
to
orders
was
only
later
in
the
day
it
became
evident
that
a
council
of
war
was
being
held
the
murmur
of
the
men
voices
reached
the
plateau
but
no
words
could
be
distinguished
an
oath
from
vasilici
sounded
clearly
now
and
again
but
that
was
all
some
persuasion
was
apparently
pressed
upon
the
chief
which
he
jeered
and
laughed
at
but
there
was
a
shaking
of
heads
when
he
pointed
to
the
way
his
followers
were
not
inclined
to
try
that
road
to
victory
again
they
had
had
their
surfeit
of
it
vasilici
was
enough
to
see
that
he
must
listen
to
counsel
and
with
lowering
visage
he
turned
first
to
one
and
then
to
another
as
they
spoke
presently
one
speaker
seemed
to
please
him
for
his
features
relaxed
into
a
grim
smile
a
movement
ran
through
the
whole
assembly
men
turned
to
one
another
and
nodded
their
satisfaction
some
definite
conclusion
had
been
arrived
at
they
seem
to
have
hit
upon
another
way
of
getting
at
us
said
stefan
is
there
another
way
asked
grigosie
repeating
the
same
question
he
had
asked
before
no
one
answered
him
nor
did
he
seem
to
expect
an
answer
he
stood
watching
the
now
moving
mass
below
little
interest
in
his
eyes
his
alertness
had
departed
vasilici
had
disappeared
into
some
pathway
at
the
foot
of
the
opposite
slope
and
then
the
crowd
fell
aside
for
one
man
who
standing
alone
took
off
his
neckcloth
and
waved
it
toward
the
plateau
a
parley
captain
shall
i
answer
said
stefan
and
then
having
permission
he
shouted
hallo
i
would
speak
with
your
captain
came
the
answer
i
a
mouthpiece
comrade
same
as
you
are
speak
on
i
am
commanded
to
offer
you
your
lives
and
freedom
on
one
condition
and
the
condition
stefan
shouted
prompted
by
ellerey
you
are
free
to
leave
the
pass
unmolested
if
you
will
deliver
up
the
youth
who
is
of
your
company
we
see
you
stefan
began
without
any
prompting
word
it
as
you
will
said
ellerey
the
coarser
the
better
perhaps
for
such
a
devilish
suggestion
wait
exclaimed
grigosie
ask
for
time
to
consider
who
wants
to
consider
such
a
thing
as
that
growled
stefan
we
gain
time
said
grigosie
turning
to
ellerey
say
you
will
consider
the
suggestion
and
answer
them
tomorrow
we
sorely
need
rest
what
does
it
matter
how
we
gain
it
my
gorge
revolts
against
their
even
fancying
that
we
should
consider
such
a
thing
said
stefan
command
him
captain
pleaded
grigosie
in
war
and
love
everything
is
fair
ellerey
gave
way
and
stefan
shouted
the
answer
until
came
the
answer
the
youth
once
in
our
hands
you
are
free
to
depart
if
he
is
not
given
up
to
us
we
will
have
our
revenge
though
half
the
sons
of
these
mountains
fall
in
the
gaining
it
and
the
longer
that
revenge
is
delayed
the
fiercer
shall
it
be
when
it
does
come
until
there
shall
be
peace
between
us
until
then
but
we
keep
watch
by
the
gate
for
all
that
growled
stefan
who
was
not
in
the
best
of
tempers
at
having
to
answer
the
brigands
in
this
fashion
there
is
another
way
you
see
said
grigosie
i
have
got
an
answer
to
my
question
well
lad
when
you
alone
are
in
their
hands
the
rest
of
us
will
have
said
his
last
prayer
or
growled
his
last
oath
whichever
pleases
him
best
at
the
hour
of
departure
the
question
is
not
so
easily
settled
stefan
grigosie
said
send
anton
to
the
gate
captain
while
we
discuss
it
ellerey
laughed
at
the
lad
strange
mood
as
he
entered
the
tower
with
him
stefan
followed
them
and
stood
in
the
doorway
the
question
is
worth
consideration
though
you
may
not
think
so
grigosie
began
you
have
been
deceived
captain
and
also
those
who
served
with
you
enough
of
that
lad
it
is
past
and
the
present
is
our
concern
if
we
come
out
of
this
with
our
lives
we
may
talk
of
punishing
those
who
deceived
us
should
it
not
be
a
bitter
punishment
queried
the
boy
as
bitter
as
the
death
to
which
they
have
brought
us
face
to
face
said
ellerey
fiercely
his
whole
being
roused
for
a
moment
at
the
thought
of
the
outrage
practised
upon
him
but
that
revenge
seems
out
of
your
power
grigosie
went
on
for
you
and
stefan
there
is
almost
certain
death
or
a
week
hence
it
may
be
it
is
very
likely
i
have
looked
death
in
the
face
before
and
so
has
stefan
there
when
we
look
into
his
eyes
for
the
last
time
i
warrant
we
shall
not
change
color
except
with
the
heat
of
our
final
struggle
said
stefan
from
the
doorway
your
comrades
have
gone
you
two
stand
alone
said
grigosie
with
you
and
anton
said
stefan
and
we
wish
for
no
better
companions
added
ellerey
knife
would
have
written
finis
to
my
history
had
it
not
been
for
you
grigosie
the
boy
colored
a
little
with
pleasure
still
you
forget
captain
that
anton
and
i
were
not
of
your
choosing
we
forced
ourselves
into
your
company
what
of
it
i
am
glad
i
and
then
the
look
in
grigosie
eyes
stopped
ellerey
suddenly
stefan
too
started
from
his
leaning
position
and
stood
upright
in
the
entrance
looking
straight
at
the
boy
by
your
leave
i
would
become
the
hostage
for
your
safety
said
grigosie
i
asked
you
to
take
me
with
you
now
i
ask
you
to
give
me
up
plague
upon
you
lad
you
almost
anger
me
you
are
beyond
my
understanding
was
ellerey
answer
but
he
still
looked
fixedly
at
him
since
i
have
deceived
you
it
is
fitting
that
i
should
pay
the
penalty
said
the
boy
quietly
i
would
sooner
meet
death
at
their
hands
than
at
yours
grant
me
this
much
and
make
an
end
of
it
you
exclaimed
ellerey
you
deceived
me
i
do
not
believe
it
it
is
the
truth
stay
i
would
not
have
you
think
too
ill
of
me
it
was
not
done
wantonly
those
who
made
me
believe
that
there
was
a
good
chance
of
success
misled
me
but
if
i
thought
you
too
would
reap
the
benefit
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
i
deceived
you
i
came
not
from
the
queen
i
came
to
work
this
very
thing
that
has
happened
the
delivery
of
the
golden
cross
instead
of
the
bracelet
i
have
played
my
hand
and
lost
mine
should
be
a
bitter
punishment
you
yourself
have
said
it
grant
me
this
only
that
i
receive
it
from
the
brigands
yonder
and
not
from
you
ellerey
hardly
seemed
to
hear
the
boy
latter
words
the
sudden
confession
was
all
his
brain
seemed
to
have
the
power
to
take
in
stefan
remained
motionless
still
staring
at
grigosie
for
a
space
there
was
silence
in
the
tower
then
ellerey
turned
sharply
upon
the
boy
and
laid
his
hand
roughly
on
his
shoulder
so
roughly
that
he
winced
a
little
but
showed
no
sign
of
fear
you
lie
grigosie
confess
that
you
lie
the
box
containing
the
token
has
never
left
me
night
or
day
as
i
received
it
from
her
majesty
so
it
has
always
been
so
i
delivered
it
of
course
you
are
lying
you
slept
soundly
captain
the
night
you
drank
from
my
wine
flask
was
it
then
you
scoundrel
it
was
then
deep
down
in
every
man
is
the
instinct
of
the
savage
the
acceptance
of
the
law
which
demands
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
given
occasion
great
enough
it
may
rise
even
in
the
man
who
has
all
his
life
studied
to
curb
his
passions
and
in
his
judgments
to
be
merciful
ellerey
was
of
the
rough
and
readier
sort
he
was
a
disappointed
man
one
who
nursed
the
thought
of
revenge
against
those
who
had
injured
him
he
was
a
soldier
among
soldiers
who
had
much
of
the
barbarian
in
them
he
was
an
adventurer
among
adventurers
if
the
youth
of
this
deceiver
and
betrayer
appealed
to
him
for
a
moment
the
thought
was
sternly
crushed
if
the
thought
of
what
they
had
come
through
together
came
into
his
mind
there
also
came
the
knowledge
that
he
had
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
he
had
betrayed
his
comrades
heaven
forgive
you
for
making
me
your
judge
ellerey
cried
but
what
is
there
except
death
for
the
traitor
and
his
sword
rang
from
its
scabbard
as
he
spoke
he
paused
a
moment
and
looked
toward
stefan
it
hateful
but
it
just
muttered
the
soldier
in
his
beard
and
he
did
not
move
from
the
doorway
he
only
lowered
his
head
so
that
he
might
not
see
i
admit
the
justice
said
grigosie
but
will
you
not
grant
my
request
and
deliver
me
to
the
brigands
so
you
shall
escape
escape
cried
ellerey
for
what
is
there
any
truth
and
honor
in
the
world
i
have
not
found
them
and
the
end
may
come
when
it
will
it
is
an
easier
death
you
shall
have
from
my
hands
than
you
would
have
from
theirs
the
sword
was
ready
and
stefan
turned
in
the
doorway
just
in
time
to
see
anton
and
to
catch
his
uplifted
arm
as
he
attempted
to
rush
past
him
toward
ellerey
not
a
word
spoke
the
soldier
but
he
fiercely
twisted
anton
aim
and
the
knife
he
held
rattled
to
the
floor
as
my
fathers
faced
death
so
can
i
unflinchingly
grigosie
cried
strike
captain
god
knows
it
was
not
such
work
as
this
i
thought
to
find
for
the
strong
arm
of
desmond
ellerey
as
he
spoke
he
tore
his
shirt
open
at
the
throat
to
receive
the
blow
his
cap
fell
from
his
head
and
curls
the
hue
of
copper
slipped
loosely
down
upon
his
forehead
while
the
open
shirt
just
revealed
the
curve
of
a
white
bosom
a
woman
exclaimed
stefan
letting
go
of
anton
in
his
blank
astonishment
slowly
ellerey
sword
was
lowered
and
for
a
moment
he
did
not
speak
then
almost
in
a
whisper
he
said
maritza
princess
maritza
chapter
xvii
the
true
worth
of
baron
petrescu
there
was
excitement
in
sturatzberg
rumor
flies
fast
and
the
moment
it
was
whispered
that
the
city
gates
were
watched
that
captain
ellerey
of
his
majesty
horse
was
to
be
arrested
men
began
to
stop
and
gossip
at
street
corners
and
women
to
stand
upon
their
thresholds
ready
to
give
or
to
receive
information
strange
stories
grew
current
in
this
manner
which
served
to
keep
the
excitement
alive
until
more
definite
news
were
forthcoming
there
was
unwonted
stir
in
the
secret
societies
and
clubs
sympathy
being
with
ellerey
since
he
had
in
some
manner
offended
the
government
they
did
not
stay
to
inquire
what
he
had
done
or
indeed
to
think
whether
his
action
would
tend
to
further
any
scheme
of
their
own
it
was
enough
that
he
had
shown
defiance
to
the
powers
that
be
every
hour
fresh
rumors
were
started
and
eagerly
discussed
and
as
eagerly
denied
only
two
things
were
definite
there
was
much
coming
and
going
at
the
palace
and
captain
ellerey
was
not
to
be
found
those
who
lead
rebellion
or
pull
the
wires
of
conspiracies
are
seldom
open
with
those
they
lead
any
more
than
the
policy
of
king
ministers
is
wholly
spread
before
the
people
there
were
leaders
in
sturatzberg
who
knew
many
things
who
shrewdly
guessed
at
more
and
their
knowledge
was
not
reassuring
lord
cloverton
did
not
expect
the
immediate
arrest
of
ellerey
after
the
failure
to
discover
him
at
the
countess
mavrodin
he
had
fully
believed
that
he
was
there
and
had
purposely
kept
the
countess
driving
in
the
bois
until
such
time
as
the
search
should
be
accomplished
the
failure
was
disappointing
but
his
interview
with
the
countess
would
bear
fruit
ellerey
would
have
to
move
cautiously
and
time
was
therefore
gained
the
gates
were
closed
that
night
and
no
captain
ellerey
had
passed
through
them
countess
mavrodin
house
was
watched
and
no
one
had
left
it
so
the
ambassador
met
the
morning
with
a
smile
so
far
his
prompt
action
had
saved
the
situation
a
few
hours
were
destined
to
bring
him
surprises
first
came
the
news
of
the
return
of
captain
ward
cloak
the
messenger
who
brought
it
was
promptly
taken
before
the
ambassador
and
sharply
questioned
he
had
received
it
from
captain
ellerey
himself
an
hour
before
midnight
he
said
why
were
you
chosen
as
a
messenger
asked
lord
cloverton
i
can
not
say
i
brought
it
because
i
was
paid
to
do
so
you
seem
very
certain
of
the
time
did
captain
ellerey
tell
you
the
hour
no
sir
the
clocks
were
striking
the
hour
as
he
spoke
to
me
what
is
captain
ellerey
like
the
description
given
seemed
satisfactory
until
after
the
man
had
been
dismissed
and
then
lord
cloverton
recognized
that
it
would
fit
many
men
the
cloak
was
captain
ward
but
there
was
no
certainty
that
ellerey
was
the
man
who
had
given
it
to
the
messenger
the
city
was
being
searched
the
return
of
the
cloak
went
to
prove
that
ellerey
was
still
in
sturatzberg
had
that
been
the
intention
in
returning
it
the
smile
of
satisfaction
slowly
faded
from
the
ambassador
face
and
he
began
to
grow
feverish
for
further
news
later
he
was
with
the
king
when
the
countess
mavrodin
begged
for
an
audience
she
may
unwittingly
enlighten
your
majesty
said
lord
cloverton
he
could
not
believe
that
his
cleverness
would
not
be
sufficient
sooner
or
later
to
make
the
countess
betray
herself
although
the
past
was
utterly
barren
of
result
so
frina
mavrodin
was
admitted
the
presence
of
the
british
ambassador
did
not
disconcert
her
she
went
to
the
point
at
once
is
it
true
your
majesty
that
my
house
was
searched
yesterday
by
your
instructions
she
asked
countess
how
can
you
think
that
said
the
king
it
is
true
that
i
commanded
the
arrest
of
captain
ellerey
and
that
command
may
have
been
used
to
open
your
doors
as
it
would
serve
to
open
any
door
in
sturatzberg
i
have
heard
of
no
other
house
being
entered
by
force
the
countess
answered
naturally
i
seek
to
know
why
i
am
suspected
she
puzzled
lord
cloverton
more
than
ever
this
was
a
bold
stroke
to
disarm
suspicion
my
dear
countess
said
the
king
blandly
would
you
hold
me
responsible
for
the
actions
of
my
officers
believe
me
the
city
is
being
searched
in
every
corner
for
this
rebel
captain
it
is
pardonable
if
in
the
search
some
annoyance
is
given
to
innocent
persons
is
it
not
their
loyalty
should
overlook
the
offence
true
but
your
majesty
i
would
humbly
submit
overlooks
one
fact
of
the
gravest
importance
to
me
that
my
house
is
searched
for
a
rebel
is
nothing
but
when
it
is
searched
for
a
man
who
at
court
has
been
somewhat
in
my
company
the
action
affects
me
curiously
it
is
not
a
question
of
loyalty
but
one
which
concerns
my
fair
fame
surely
countess
you
exaggerate
indeed
your
majesty
i
do
not
as
lord
cloverton
can
prove
only
yesterday
in
the
bois
he
made
it
evident
that
court
gossip
linked
my
name
with
captain
ellerey
and
even
suggested
that
i
might
render
service
to
my
country
and
this
englishman
at
the
same
time
by
saying
all
i
knew
is
it
not
so
my
lord
you
were
very
anxious
to
save
your
countryman
and
get
him
out
of
the
city
this
was
more
than
the
ambassador
had
bargained
for
and
an
answer
did
not
come
readily
to
his
lips
is
it
not
so
my
lord
the
countess
repeated
i
admit
countess
that
fancying
there
was
some
tender
understanding
between
you
and
my
countryman
i
was
willing
if
possible
to
render
you
a
service
i
seem
to
have
heard
that
love
has
been
accountable
for
strange
and
even
foolish
actions
this
is
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
my
offence
are
you
sure
of
that
she
said
forgive
me
if
i
am
mistaken
but
the
searching
of
my
house
was
strangely
timed
with
our
drive
in
the
bois
oh
countess
the
ambassador
exclaimed
surely
you
forget
that
i
only
availed
myself
of
your
courteous
invitation
which
i
could
do
no
less
than
give
since
you
explained
that
you
had
foregone
your
afternoon
sleep
to
meet
me
there
she
replied
quickly
and
smiled
the
smile
of
a
very
charming
woman
of
the
world
as
most
people
considered
her
but
lord
cloverton
seemed
to
catch
some
meaning
behind
the
smile
and
the
king
felt
that
he
ought
to
come
to
his
rescue
we
have
both
fallen
under
the
countess
displeasure
how
can
we
prove
how
unjustly
i
will
reprimand
my
too
zealous
officers
and
they
shall
make
you
an
apology
your
majesty
is
good
she
answered
for
myself
it
is
no
great
consequence
but
had
you
witnessed
the
consternation
of
my
servants
you
would
have
understood
how
serious
a
matter
it
was
in
their
eyes
subjects
and
servants
alike
countess
are
our
masters
said
the
king
frina
mavrodin
departed
full
of
thanks
and
wreathed
in
gracious
smiles
when
she
had
gone
the
king
and
the
ambassador
looked
inquiringly
at
each
other
i
think
your
suspicions
were
unfounded
my
lord
the
king
said
i
missed
the
centre
of
the
target
your
majesty
but
i
believe
i
aimed
at
the
right
mark
she
is
a
clever
woman
i
admire
her
more
every
day
lord
cloverton
spoke
the
truth
he
did
admire
her
like
all
great
men
he
was
quick
to
recognize
the
sterling
worth
of
his
adversaries
and
it
was
borne
in
upon
him
more
and
more
that
in
this
crisis
he
had
a
clever
and
beautiful
woman
to
deal
with
and
what
antagonist
could
be
more
powerful
he
began
to
rearrange
his
thoughts
upon
this
basis
passed
in
review
all
the
seemingly
trivial
incidents
with
which
frida
mavrodin
had
been
connected
and
found
many
new
meanings
in
them
the
possibility
that
her
influence
might
be
paramount
in
sturatzberg
dawned
upon
him
such
a
subtle
power
at
work
would
explain
many
things
and
the
ambassador
determined
to
watch
her
more
closely
than
ever
all
that
day
search
was
made
for
captain
ellerey
throughout
the
city
many
places
known
to
be
haunts
of
the
dissatisfied
were
entered
but
were
innocent
of
even
the
appearance
of
evil
there
were
too
many
ready
to
bear
warning
for
such
places
to
be
taken
unawares
but
no
other
houses
of
such
importance
as
the
countess
mavrodin
were
disturbed
there
was
no
result
no
one
had
seen
captain
ellerey
indeed
few
people
appeared
to
know
him
or
to
have
heard
of
him
this
lord
cloverton
did
not
believe
he
thought
he
recognized
frina
influence
at
work
in
such
ignorance
it
was
on
the
following
day
that
monsieur
de
froilette
called
at
the
embassy
and
was
shown
into
lord
cloverton
room
with
this
new
train
of
thought
in
his
mind
the
frenchman
importance
in
the
politics
of
wallaria
appeared
to
sink
into
insignificance
you
are
welcome
monsieur
is
this
a
friendly
visit
or
friendly
certainly
but
something
more
de
froilette
answered
he
had
not
come
to
the
embassy
without
due
deliberation
he
had
had
an
audience
with
the
queen
that
morning
and
there
was
something
in
her
tone
which
decided
him
to
make
his
own
interests
doubly
secure
by
giving
help
to
the
british
ambassador
such
help
that
might
count
for
much
when
the
time
for
settling
accounts
came
but
which
should
not
materially
hasten
that
time
i
had
begun
to
think
you
had
forgotten
your
promise
said
lord
cloverton
news
of
captain
ellerey
would
be
very
useful
to
to
the
government
of
this
country
you
had
a
servant
watching
him
i
think
there
was
something
resembling
the
queen
tone
in
the
ambassador
a
want
of
appreciation
of
his
position
and
importance
that
is
so
replied
de
froilette
quietly
i
understand
you
that
is
the
government
have
done
your
utmost
to
find
this
englishman
and
have
failed
at
present
monsieur
at
present
which
is
hardly
wonderful
continued
de
froilette
i
have
so
constantly
observed
that
you
the
government
i
should
say
concentrates
its
energies
in
the
wrong
direction
is
it
not
so
my
lord
an
opinion
which
may
observe
i
do
not
say
which
does
but
which
may
arise
from
an
entirely
wrong
conception
of
the
government
aims
that
is
so
laughed
the
frenchman
conscious
that
the
ambassador
was
annoyed
of
course
in
my
ignorance
i
have
supposed
that
the
government
in
searching
for
this
captain
ellerey
really
wanted
to
find
him
foolish
of
me
it
was
a
mere
blind
a
strategy
to
mislead
the
government
is
really
looking
for
some
one
else
pardon
me
my
lord
for
taking
up
your
time
and
de
froilette
rose
to
go
you
are
too
hasty
monsieur
pray
be
seated
again
it
is
captain
ellerey
we
want
ah
then
i
am
not
deceived
said
de
froilette
sitting
down
again
tell
me
why
do
you
so
persistently
look
for
him
in
the
wrong
place
can
you
show
us
the
right
one
monsieur
send
your
troops
out
by
the
southern
gate
and
bid
them
march
toward
breslen
and
let
sharp
eyes
watch
the
depths
of
the
forest
they
may
be
rewarded
by
seeing
men
gathering
to
a
centre
there
find
that
centre
and
you
shall
find
captain
ellerey
is
it
your
timber
business
which
teaches
you
so
much
inquired
lord
cloverton
with
a
smile
some
contempt
looking
out
from
behind
it
you
laugh
at
my
trade
but
it
may
prove
useful
even
to
you
you
watch
the
city
gates
you
search
every
street
and
corner
of
sturatzberg
and
behold
your
bird
is
flown
and
is
many
hours
upon
his
journey
before
you
even
start
in
pursuit
this
is
most
interesting
monsieur
but
but
you
do
not
believe
it
interrupted
de
froilette
i
have
had
a
message
from
this
captain
ellerey
my
servant
watched
his
lodgings
early
in
the
morning
a
boy
brought
a
message
to
the
captain
servant
francois
my
man
entered
the
house
and
got
into
conversation
with
this
servant
a
rude
soldier
with
small
understanding
but
with
stanch
love
for
his
master
put
upon
his
guard
by
ellerey
doubtless
he
conceives
the
possibility
that
francois
may
be
playing
the
spy
and
falling
upon
him
unawares
he
gags
and
binds
him
and
locks
him
in
a
cellar
the
next
day
captain
ellerey
a
band
of
horsemen
with
him
meets
a
woodman
in
the
forest
toward
breslen
and
by
him
sends
me
word
that
my
servant
is
gradually
starving
behind
his
cellar
door
of
which
the
woodman
gives
my
the
key
i
go
to
the
captain
lodging
and
there
is
francois
he
was
hungry
my
lord
and
he
will
be
very
terrible
the
next
time
he
and
that
soldier
meet
on
the
breslen
road
you
say
lord
cloverton
remarked
thoughtfully
he
had
made
up
his
mind
quickly
probably
in
breslen
itself
by
this
time
i
understand
there
is
much
dissatisfaction
there
and
captain
ellerey
object
monsieur
the
frenchman
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
though
such
a
consideration
had
not
occurred
to
him
is
my
opinion
worth
anything
my
lord
i
am
not
in
the
councils
of
the
government
i
know
little
of
the
state
difficulties
the
plots
which
threaten
the
particular
points
of
danger
but
as
a
private
person
i
should
incline
to
the
belief
that
it
has
to
do
with
the
princess
maritza
i
have
already
told
you
that
she
is
or
was
in
sturatzberg
you
do
not
believe
it
that
is
a
pity
i
am
beginning
to
believe
it
monsieur
the
ambassador
answered
and
i
thank
you
for
coming
here
the
gates
of
sturatzberg
are
not
so
well
guarded
as
they
should
be
that
is
not
my
affair
said
de
froilette
with
a
smile
i
have
given
my
information
to
you
because
i
know
the
prestige
of
lord
cloverton
and
his
value
to
the
peace
of
wallaria
with
these
parting
compliments
the
frenchman
bowed
himself
out
feeling
that
he
had
established
his
position
with
the
ambassador
and
put
him
off
the
real
scent
at
one
and
the
same
time
the
pleasant
security
of
the
latter
feeling
was
destined
to
be
quickly
and
rudely
dispelled
some
troops
certainly
did
leave
the
city
and
go
toward
breslen
but
many
more
set
out
in
the
opposite
direction
and
stretched
across
the
country
which
lay
between
sturatzberg
and
the
mountains
lord
cloverton
in
advising
the
king
was
still
convinced
that
the
most
imminent
danger
threatened
from
the
brigands
in
the
hills
the
despatch
of
the
troops
did
not
surprise
frina
mavrodin
that
they
should
go
chiefly
toward
the
hills
seemed
only
natural
seeing
that
the
brigands
lay
there
the
time
since
she
had
returned
to
find
that
her
home
had
been
searched
had
passed
in
a
whirl
of
conflicting
emotions
for
a
few
moments
after
dismissing
hannah
she
had
stood
upright
immovable
with
a
sense
of
being
alone
in
the
world
all
the
interests
and
hopes
of
her
life
seemed
to
slip
from
her
and
fall
into
a
heap
of
dead
ashes
at
her
feet
the
princess
had
gone
doubtless
she
had
meant
to
go
when
frina
had
left
her
that
morning
and
had
got
her
out
of
the
way
on
purpose
it
was
dumitru
who
had
suggested
her
going
into
the
bois
it
was
dumitru
probably
who
had
persuaded
maritza
that
the
time
to
act
had
come
not
for
a
moment
did
frina
suppose
that
dumitru
was
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
her
house
would
be
searched
she
did
not
believe
that
they
had
gone
to
escape
discovery
if
such
had
been
the
case
she
would
have
been
taken
into
their
confidence
no
the
departure
had
taken
place
for
the
furtherance
of
plans
in
which
she
had
no
part
and
which
she
promptly
linked
with
the
disappearance
of
captain
ellerey
it
never
occurred
to
frina
to
set
watches
to
warn
the
princess
should
she
return
she
would
not
return
for
good
or
ill
she
had
begun
the
final
move
toward
her
goal
what
were
her
plans
what
chance
had
they
of
success
frina
knew
what
secret
societies
nursed
the
cause
of
princess
maritza
in
the
city
she
knew
to
a
unit
what
support
could
be
depended
upon
knew
the
exact
value
of
it
the
strength
and
the
weakness
of
it
the
cause
had
looked
to
the
hills
for
support
not
without
reason
perhaps
were
not
the
men
gathered
there
rebels
ready
to
strike
a
blow
at
the
government
this
had
always
been
maritza
argument
and
there
had
been
some
signs
that
she
was
right
frina
knew
that
the
material
for
revolt
was
to
hand
but
a
resolute
leader
had
been
lacking
now
this
want
had
been
supplied
by
captain
ellerey
it
was
round
ellerey
that
the
whirl
of
frina
emotions
centred
her
relief
that
the
princess
had
gone
before
the
house
was
searched
gave
place
to
the
apprehension
that
she
had
gone
to
join
captain
ellerey
she
saw
only
a
rival
in
her
late
guest
it
was
her
love
for
the
man
which
ruled
frina
mavrodin
actions
not
her
love
for
the
cause
it
was
in
this
spirit
that
she
made
her
complaint
to
the
king
for
the
time
might
come
when
her
house
would
prove
the
only
safe
refuge
for
ellerey
it
was
in
this
spirit
that
with
her
maid
in
attendance
she
presently
went
to
visit
baron
petrescu
the
baron
wound
had
not
proved
serious
but
it
had
kept
him
to
the
house
the
countess
found
him
lying
on
a
sofa
from
which
he
half
rose
as
she
entered
she
hurried
forward
to
prevent
him
this
is
good
of
you
countess
he
said
strangely
you
were
in
my
thoughts
when
you
were
announced
she
inquired
about
his
wound
and
expressed
her
regrets
in
a
few
prettily
turned
sentences
it
was
nothing
said
the
baron
the
greatest
hurt
was
to
my
pride
and
of
course
you
long
for
an
opportunity
of
wiping
out
the
defeat
said
frina
curiously
enough
that
idea
has
not
risen
uppermost
in
my
thoughts
petrescu
answered
i
owe
the
englishman
an
apology
for
the
attack
which
was
made
upon
him
directly
he
succeeded
in
wounding
me
he
is
a
gentleman
and
a
gallant
swordsman
and
i
writhe
under
the
fear
that
he
believes
that
attack
was
of
my
contriving
there
was
the
genuine
ring
of
truth
in
the
baron
words
frina
mavrodin
was
not
surprised
she
believed
that
she
thoroughly
understood
him
or
would
not
have
visited
him
you
would
befriend
captain
ellerey
were
it
in
your
power
she
questioned
gladly
for
his
own
sake
and
for
yours
pardon
me
countess
if
my
own
confession
slips
out
with
these
words
those
who
love
recognize
love
quickly
was
that
in
your
mind
when
you
forced
this
duel
upon
captain
ellerey
she
asked
i
have
tried
to
believe
that
love
for
the
cause
stood
first
countess
please
question
me
no
further
i
take
refuge
behind
the
punishment
i
have
received
that
i
have
not
forfeited
all
your
esteem
is
proved
by
your
presence
here
tell
me
how
i
can
serve
you
like
many
others
baron
you
jump
to
a
conclusion
too
quickly
but
let
it
pass
there
is
weightier
business
in
hand
and
then
she
told
him
all
that
was
known
about
ellerey
and
of
the
disappearance
of
princess
maritza
knowing
that
the
princess
always
had
it
in
her
mind
to
use
captain
ellerey
when
the
time
came
she
went
on
i
have
little
doubt
she
has
joined
him
in
whatever
mission
he
has
undertaken
what
art
she
will
or
can
use
to
turn
him
to
her
service
i
do
not
know
he
is
not
the
man
to
be
lightly
turned
from
the
cause
he
has
espoused
said
the
baron
thoughtfully
and
that
cause
is
not
ours
love
might
prove
incentive
enough
said
frina
petrescu
turned
to
her
quickly
the
look
in
her
eyes
told
him
her
secret
plainly
enough
but
her
words
were
sufficient
to
have
a
quickening
influence
on
the
hopes
which
had
died
within
him
i
may
be
jumping
to
a
rash
conclusion
frina
went
on
hastily
but
if
i
am
right
indeed
whatever
art
is
used
what
hope
is
there
of
success
none
unless
those
in
the
hills
are
with
us
replied
the
baron
decisively
here
in
sturatzberg
we
have
much
enthusiasm
much
talk
much
jealousy
but
i
doubt
the
fighting
temper
behind
it
the
princess
has
moved
too
soon
is
there
any
chance
of
her
being
able
to
persuade
the
brigands
where
men
are
concerned
i
dare
not
limit
the
power
of
a
woman
he
answered
but
since
the
princess
has
moved
we
are
bound
to
be
on
the
watch
failure
will
be
disastrous
to
you
and
me
countess
it
will
probably
mean
death
to
princess
maritza
to
captain
ellerey
certainly
i
understand
said
the
baron
the
hope
that
was
in
him
died
and
it
is
doubtful
if
the
woman
ever
gave
him
full
credit
for
what
his
words
cost
him
i
understand
i
shall
be
out
again
command
me
and
trust
me
there
shall
at
least
be
one
arm
to
strike
a
blow
in
the
englishman
defence
and
back
to
back
countess
he
and
i
would
render
no
mean
account
of
ourselves
she
had
taken
the
hand
he
held
out
in
token
of
her
thanks
and
the
compact
between
them
when
the
door
was
suddenly
opened
and
a
man
entered
hurriedly
he
stopped
abruptly
seeing
that
his
master
was
not
alone
i
have
no
secrets
from
this
lady
said
the
baron
you
may
speak
freely
the
city
is
in
excitement
said
the
man
some
horsemen
have
ridden
in
saying
that
captain
ellerey
is
in
the
hills
surrounded
by
the
brigands
instead
of
being
on
the
king
service
as
the
men
supposed
he
carried
the
token
of
princess
maritza
house
the
brigands
immediately
attacked
the
party
yes
and
then
exclaimed
frina
these
men
deserted
my
lady
and
left
the
captain
and
two
or
three
companions
to
their
fate
these
fellows
are
boasting
loudly
of
their
loyalty
to
the
king
and
the
others
are
they
dead
or
captured
asked
the
baron
quickly
it
seems
they
managed
to
gain
some
ruin
in
the
hills
and
are
there
making
a
last
stand
the
baron
dismissed
the
man
and
then
turned
sharply
to
the
countess
you
must
go
quickly
and
learn
all
the
news
he
said
my
wound
shall
be
made
to
serve
a
useful
purpose
it
shall
be
sufficient
to
keep
me
free
from
visitors
for
some
days
to
come
but
it
will
not
prevent
my
leaving
sturatzberg
i
have
a
few
men
i
can
rely
upon
we
may
not
turn
failure
to
success
but
we
may
effect
the
escape
of
captain
ellerey
and
those
who
are
with
him
have
you
a
trusted
messenger
you
can
send
to
me
yes
learn
all
you
can
then
and
send
word
to
me
here
before
nine
at
that
hour
you
may
know
that
i
have
departed
and
what
a
man
may
do
rest

chapter
xviii
six
loyal
men
from
the
northern
to
the
southern
from
the
eastern
to
the
western
gates
sturatzberg
was
in
an
uproar
excitement
was
in
every
face
and
the
wildest
rumors
were
given
credence
when
the
guards
at
the
gates
were
doubled
and
companies
of
soldiers
were
met
in
the
streets
it
was
firmly
believed
that
the
brigands
were
marching
in
overwhelming
numbers
upon
the
city
comparatively
few
had
heard
the
news
from
the
returned
horsemen
own
lips
and
from
much
reporting
the
tale
had
grown
out
of
all
knowledge
after
the
excitement
caused
by
the
search
for
captain
ellerey
the
city
was
ready
to
believe
anything
as
the
baron
servant
had
related
the
horsemen
were
loud
in
their
boasting
of
loyalty
they
had
followed
captain
ellerey
because
they
believed
they
were
on
the
king
service
they
said
and
never
for
a
moment
had
they
supposed
otherwise
until
they
had
seen
the
golden
cross
in
vasilici
hands
this
was
the
story
they
told
the
king
when
they
were
taken
to
the
palace
with
much
more
concerning
their
own
valor
when
the
brigands
rushed
upon
them
they
disagreed
somewhat
concerning
one
another
valour
each
one
striving
to
impress
the
king
in
his
own
favor
but
they
were
of
one
voice
regarding
ellerey
treachery
and
the
deceit
which
had
been
practised
upon
them
what
message
or
token
could
you
suppose
i
was
sending
to
the
brigands
asked
the
king
it
was
not
for
us
to
inquire
your
majesty
they
answered
we
knew
captain
ellerey
and
we
obeyed
him
in
the
main
their
story
was
true
if
ellerey
had
mentioned
the
queen
as
their
employer
they
had
considered
the
king
and
queen
as
one
and
no
question
was
put
to
them
to
make
them
differentiate
between
them
they
were
dismissed
and
the
king
was
for
some
hours
closeted
with
one
or
two
of
his
prominent
ministers
they
were
men
the
king
trusted
but
it
was
doubtful
if
their
opinion
ever
weighed
with
him
to
the
same
extent
that
lord
cloverton
did
the
news
astonished
the
ambassador
but
was
reassuring
whatever
the
cause
the
queen
plans
at
any
rate
had
miscarried
and
the
brigands
were
evidently
not
to
be
tempted
into
the
service
of
princess
maritza
for
the
moment
there
was
no
danger
to
be
apprehended
from
them
i
think
we
may
leave
this
turbulent
captain
and
his
companions
to
vasilici
tender
mercies
my
lord
said
the
king
all
we
have
to
guard
against
is
a
riot
among
the
dissatisfied
in
sturatzberg
perhaps
the
ambassador
felt
sorry
for
ellerey
but
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
has
your
majesty
ever
supposed
that
princess
maritza
is
or
has
been
lately
in
sturatzberg
he
asked
after
a
pause
it
is
impossible
your
government
has
sent
her
visiting
your
colonies
a
delicate
attention
which
no
doubt
she
appreciates
just
so
and
yet
i
had
a
strange
story
brought
to
my
notice
i
heard
that
she
had
managed
to
escape
the
delicate
attention
of
my
government
and
had
returned
to
wallaria
needless
to
say
i
did
not
believe
the
story
but
the
deliverance
of
her
token
certainly
lends
credence
to
it
she
might
send
her
token
said
the
king
she
would
not
venture
herself
in
the
country
much
less
in
sturatzberg
that
was
my
opinion
answered
cloverton
do
you
mean
that
it
is
not
your
opinion
now
i
am
in
a
transitional
stage
your
majesty
and
have
not
yet
decided
so
there
were
troops
of
soldiers
in
the
streets
lest
rioters
should
gather
together
and
do
damage
no
one
imagined
there
was
enough
power
behind
them
to
really
menace
the
city
a
few
men
talked
together
excitedly
in
side
streets
but
these
dispersed
quietly
after
a
little
while
without
any
interference
from
the
soldiers
the
countess
mavrodin
drove
in
the
bois
as
usual
she
held
a
little
court
her
carriage
drawn
up
to
the
sidewalk
and
she
listened
to
and
laughed
at
all
the
news
what
could
it
all
matter
to
her
so
long
as
she
could
laugh
and
chatter
and
be
happy
my
horses
will
not
stand
still
if
you
talk
politics
she
said
to
one
man
they
know
their
mistress
is
of
the
nature
of
a
butterfly
the
man
was
one
who
was
likely
to
be
well
informed
and
she
did
not
say
it
until
he
had
told
her
all
he
knew
this
butterfly
nature
of
hers
caused
her
to
drive
about
a
great
deal
that
day
she
had
shopping
to
do
in
the
konigplatz
in
the
square
out
of
which
the
altstrasse
ran
and
in
the
bergenstrasse
nearly
as
far
down
as
the
southern
gate
more
than
once
she
caught
sight
of
a
group
of
excited
men
at
a
street
corner
and
once
or
twice
she
noticed
that
a
man
would
walk
leisurely
toward
them
pause
a
moment
and
then
pass
on
whenever
this
happened
the
little
crowd
dispersed
immediately
as
though
some
urgent
business
had
suddenly
occurred
to
each
member
of
it
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
countess
returned
home
and
before
she
retired
to
her
private
rooms
she
gave
instructions
for
certain
servants
whom
she
mentioned
by
name
to
be
in
readiness
as
she
would
require
them
presently
she
had
a
small
reception
that
evening
and
was
the
most
brilliant
as
she
was
the
most
frivolous
among
her
brilliant
and
frivolous
guests
yet
before
nine
baron
petrescu
had
received
some
closely
written
sheets
in
her
handwriting
and
knew
much
of
what
had
happened
in
sturatzberg
that
day
but
not
all
that
was
of
course
impossible
in
dark
corners
of
the
city
through
which
it
was
dangerous
to
travel
after
nightfall
there
were
dismal
houses
behind
the
doors
of
which
ready
orators
held
the
attention
of
eager
listeners
the
time
was
near
the
emancipation
from
their
slavery
was
at
hand
what
they
had
heard
in
the
city
was
proof
of
it
be
ready
it
was
the
same
story
wherever
men
were
gathered
together
and
in
the
constant
coming
and
going
at
the
palace
the
keenest
eyes
might
easily
have
failed
to
notice
some
who
entered
and
left
and
within
there
were
many
passages
known
only
to
the
initiated
one
man
passed
in
unnoticed
and
in
a
side
room
was
met
by
another
who
without
a
word
beckoned
him
to
follow
no
further
news
asked
the
first
none
was
the
answer
along
the
same
passage
which
ellerey
had
once
traversed
was
de
froilette
taken
and
ushered
into
the
queen
presence
he
bowed
low
but
she
had
no
thought
of
ceremony
just
now
can
you
read
this
riddle
monsieur
she
asked
all
kinds
of
solutions
come
to
me
madam
but
none
that
seem
to
entirely
fit
the
case
one
thing
only
stands
clear
said
the
queen
this
captain
ellerey
is
a
traitor
you
were
a
fool
monsieur
to
bring
him
to
my
notice
i
may
have
been
mistaken
may
indeed
you
have
she
answered
heaven
help
him
if
he
returns
to
sturatzberg
he
will
sorely
need
it
i
say
i
may
have
been
mistaken
your
majesty
and
that
is
what
i
mean
said
de
froilette
calmly
francois
has
seen
these
men
who
have
come
back
and
i
am
convinced
that
captain
ellerey
was
as
astonished
to
see
the
token
as
any
one
how
could
he
be
are
you
certain
of
the
man
who
delivered
it
to
him
as
i
am
of
myself
do
you
still
trust
this
englishman
if
he
wished
to
deceive
us
he
could
have
done
so
in
a
much
more
effectual
way
said
de
froilette
and
served
his
own
ends
better
men
like
captain
ellerey
do
not
join
themselves
to
such
a
cause
as
ours
for
the
love
of
it
but
in
their
own
interests
i
have
put
down
his
somewhat
treatment
of
me
to
his
feeling
of
security
in
being
your
majesty
trusted
messenger
so
monsieur
de
froilette
ever
so
suspicious
has
lived
to
become
weakly
confiding
i
have
another
reason
to
urge
the
frenchman
went
on
i
believe
princess
maritza
has
been
in
sturatzberg
have
you
seen
her
no
but
francois
says
he
did
he
may
have
been
mistaken
but
the
delivery
of
her
token
goes
to
confirm
francois
now
your
majesty
one
of
ellerey
companions
may
be
a
partisan
of
the
princess
and
may
have
changed
the
token
the
fact
that
i
have
led
the
princess
while
she
has
been
in
england
to
believe
that
i
have
worked
in
her
cause
might
induce
her
to
think
that
the
golden
cross
would
be
acceptable
to
the
brigands
that
they
would
welcome
the
message
it
held
had
she
trusted
you
in
any
degree
monsieur
she
would
have
made
her
presence
known
to
you
she
may
have
come
to
watch
me
and
even
then
she
could
hardly
discover
my
real
object
i
have
worked
in
your
service
too
secretly
even
lord
cloverton
trusts
me
i
would
lord
cloverton
were
removed
from
wallaria
either
by
his
government
or
by
ah
madam
death
seldom
strikes
where
we
would
have
it
if
heaven
were
pleased
to
remove
him
we
should
have
one
obstacle
the
less
in
our
way
but
many
would
still
remain
death
would
have
to
be
busy
to
make
our
enterprise
sure
lord
cloverton
stands
by
most
of
those
obstacles
to
give
them
strength
answered
the
queen
her
hands
tightening
a
little
the
king
would
be
pliant
in
my
hands
were
this
man
not
beside
him
to
stiffen
him
is
there
any
other
man
in
the
world
who
would
have
dared
to
put
me
to
the
test
he
did
i
hate
him
it
is
fortunate
he
has
done
so
he
will
not
dare
to
repeat
the
offence
said
de
froilette
i
am
not
sure
of
that
if
he
does
the
bracelet
is
mislaid
said
de
froilette
the
mere
fact
that
it
has
not
been
delivered
will
prove
that
you
never
sent
it
for
the
moment
we
are
powerless
to
act
but
another
token
will
be
sent
presently
another
messenger
found
to
take
it
have
we
not
the
assurance
of
russia
that
the
moment
the
standard
of
revolt
is
raised
she
will
find
plausible
excuse
to
cross
the
frontier
has
not
your
majesty
rather
hoped
to
succeed
without
the
help
of
russia
the
possibility
may
have
occurred
to
me
answered
the
queen
these
rebels
who
would
help
you
to
occupy
the
throne
of
wallaria
alone
would
be
difficult
to
rule
without
an
army
at
your
call
to
cow
them
into
submission
we
are
looking
to
the
future
it
is
the
present
which
concerns
us
monsieur
we
can
only
wait
and
watch
events
said
de
froilette
these
deserters
declare
that
they
rode
out
with
captain
ellerey
in
the
belief
that
they
were
upon
the
king
service
your
majesty
is
not
mentioned
by
them
we
are
safe
so
far
some
one
monsieur
holds
my
token
until
that
is
in
my
possession
again
there
is
no
safety
it
is
mislaid
said
the
frenchman
if
that
will
not
suffice
it
has
been
stolen
if
that
is
not
enough
pick
out
some
servant
you
can
spare
and
accuse
him
of
the
theft
the
sufferings
of
one
man
must
not
count
beside
the
safety
of
a
cause
involving
many
lives
you
seem
to
forget
that
captain
ellerey
knows
the
truth
said
the
queen
you
were
alone
when
you
told
him
of
his
mission
you
have
told
the
king
that
your
conversation
related
to
the
countess
mavrodin
hold
to
that
story
is
the
word
of
a
traitor
struggling
to
shield
himself
to
be
taken
against
yours
i
act
more
readily
than
i
lie
monsieur
pardon
madam
a
lie
is
a
vulgar
cowardice
we
are
dealing
with
secrets
of
the
state
i
am
woman
enough
to
find
small
difference
between
them
and
queen
enough
to
forget
the
woman
when
the
sovereign
must
use
diplomacy
answered
de
froilette
besides
we
rush
far
out
to
meet
trouble
what
can
three
or
four
men
accomplish
against
an
army
of
mountaineers
fighting
in
their
own
hills
by
this
time
captain
ellerey
lies
food
for
the
preying
vultures
we
are
quite
safe
your
majesty
de
froilette
left
the
palace
unnoticed
as
he
had
come
and
returned
quickly
to
the
altstrasse
francois
hastened
to
attend
him
there
is
nothing
to
report
monsieur
he
said
in
answer
to
his
master
look
of
inquiry
the
city
is
quieting
down
is
monsieur
in
any
danger
perhaps
francois
but
it
does
not
trouble
me
i
have
been
in
danger
before
many
channels
of
information
are
open
to
a
timber
merchant
and
those
in
authority
find
me
useful
we
can
wait
monsieur
but
those
who
are
expecting
us
to
speak
the
word
will
they
wait
i
think
so
francois
still
you
may
have
everything
ready
for
a
hasty
departure
and
if
by
any
chance
circumstances
should
necessitate
our
leaving
separately
you
must
look
for
me
in
london
at
the
old
address
such
instructions
caused
the
servant
no
surprise
his
master
had
usually
managed
to
steer
successfully
through
the
troubled
waters
he
encountered
but
on
many
occasions
such
preparations
for
rapid
flight
had
been
made
did
you
call
to
inquire
after
baron
petrescu
francois
yes
monsieur
his
wound
is
giving
him
increased
trouble
i
rejoice
to
hear
it
we
can
well
dispense
with
his
crowing
in
sturatzberg
just
now
a
walk
through
the
city
in
an
hour
or
so
francois
might
be
good
for
your
health
the
servant
smiled
falling
in
with
his
master
humor
and
went
out
the
streets
were
quiet
when
he
traversed
them
an
hour
or
two
later
a
few
soldiers
were
in
the
konigplatz
and
at
the
top
of
the
bergenstrasse
but
except
where
some
entertainment
was
going
forward
and
carriages
and
servants
were
congregated
without
the
city
was
unusually
lifeless
perhaps
the
presence
of
the
soldiers
drove
citizens
home
early
lest
they
might
come
under
suspicion
and
the
lawless
were
evidently
not
inclined
to
run
risks
francois
stood
for
a
few
moments
outside
the
countess
mavrodin
watching
the
arrivals
among
whom
he
recognized
many
notabilities
including
the
british
ambassador
and
then
he
went
for
some
distance
down
the
bergenstrasse
before
returning
home
had
he
traversed
this
street
farther
he
would
probably
have
been
convinced
that
the
exciting
news
of
the
day
was
already
forgotten
for
he
would
hardly
have
heard
the
laughter
and
songs
which
came
from
the
toison
unless
he
had
actually
gone
up
the
narrow
court
in
which
it
stood
the
door
was
shut
but
the
light
shone
dully
through
the
red
blinds
which
were
drawn
across
the
windows
they
were
like
two
huge
eyes
bleared
with
strong
drink
and
as
a
late
comer
pushed
open
the
door
at
intervals
and
disappeared
within
a
watcher
might
have
had
the
sensation
of
seeing
an
ogre
swallowing
his
victim
another
thing
might
have
struck
him
there
were
many
late
arrivals
and
they
all
came
singly
entering
swiftly
and
letting
the
door
swing
quickly
to
behind
them
the
tavern
was
surely
fast
becoming
overcrowded
for
no
one
came
out
but
there
was
much
room
in
the
toison
and
the
chamber
in
which
ellerey
had
waited
for
the
token
was
thrown
open
it
was
crowded
with
men
eager
to
listen
to
the
horsemen
who
had
ridden
into
sturatzberg
that
day
they
were
the
centre
of
attraction
and
had
long
ago
become
talkative
and
more
than
ordinarily
boastful
they
shouted
answers
to
every
question
and
were
regaled
with
tankard
after
tankard
of
liquor
they
drank
deep
healths
to
the
king
and
swore
to
their
unswerving
loyalty
with
many
a
strange
oath
they
sang
snatches
of
ribald
songs
at
the
bidding
of
any
man
who
had
the
wherewithal
to
pay
for
wine
snatches
only
which
became
less
coherent
as
the
evening
advanced
they
cursed
the
traitor
ellerey
and
made
jests
upon
maritza
who
was
called
by
some
fools
and
vagabonds
down
with
her
and
all
who
have
a
word
for
her
cried
one
of
them
trying
to
rise
to
give
vehemence
to
his
words
but
falling
back
helpless
into
his
seat
curse
her
again
comrade
said
a
thin
man
in
his
ear
do
go
to
sleep
yet
curse
her
again
we
like
to
know
the
true
ring
of
your
minds
it
was
beyond
the
soldier
power
to
reply
but
the
other
soldiers
did
it
for
him
vying
with
one
another
in
their
language
that
right
said
the
thin
man
you
are
all
agreed
she
is
a
pest
in
the
land
this
princess
an
evil
to
be
trodden
down
one
to
be
killed
if
opportunity
occurs
and
the
fact
of
her
being
a
woman
shall
win
her
no
mercy
you
are
all
agreed
on
that
no
mercy
shouted
one
soldier
less
because
she
a
woman
growled
another
down
with
her
said
a
third
in
a
drunken
whisper
one
more
drink
round
landlord
said
the
morose
man
we
drink
it
standing
those
who
can
not
stand
let
their
comrades
hold
them
up
this
is
a
loyal
and
sacred
toast
for
the
last
not
a
man
shall
sit
down
to
it
tankards
round
landlord
the
soldiers
struggled
to
their
feet
obediently
but
each
of
them
had
to
be
held
up
on
either
side
and
they
laughed
at
their
drunken
inability
seizing
a
tankard
the
thin
man
sprang
upon
a
chair
see
that
none
fail
to
honor
my
toast
he
cried
let
it
tell
its
tale
to
sturatzberg
before
the
dawn
here
to
our
sovereign
lady
princess
maritza
too
drunk
to
understand
the
purport
of
the
words
the
soldiers
raised
their
tankards
to
drink
and
then
let
them
fall
to
the
ground
with
a
clatter
the
untasted
liquor
splashing
upon
the
floor
each
man
jerked
forward
where
he
stood
and
when
those
who
held
him
let
him
go
fell
down
with
a
thud
a
groan
or
two
a
convulsive
movement
and
then
they
lay
still
while
something
mixed
with
the
spilt
liquor
and
dyed
it
to
a
darker
hue
the
six
men
who
had
stood
immediately
behind
them
wiped
their
keen
long
knives
and
sheathed
them
again
in
silence
go
quickly
shouted
the
man
still
standing
on
the
chair
see
that
the
bergenstrasse
is
clear
they
shall
rest
there
and
sturatzberg
may
find
them
there
presently
and
read
the
lesson
as
it
will
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
when
the
guests
were
leaving
the
countess
mavrodin
a
man
rushed
past
them
into
the
hall
is
lord
cloverton
still
here
the
ambassador
came
forward
at
once
what
is
it
the
men
who
returned
the
soldiers
what
of
them
they
have
just
been
found
lying
side
by
side
in
the
bergenstrasse
dead
murdered
chapter
xix
in
desperate
straits
desmond
ellerey
stood
with
his
sword
lowered
and
his
head
bowed
as
he
spoke
her
name
a
flush
came
into
his
cheeks
his
anger
at
deceit
had
been
great
stern
cold
and
judicial
only
in
such
a
spirit
could
he
take
vengeance
on
the
lad
now
it
was
shame
which
flamed
into
his
cheeks
he
had
drawn
his
sword
against
a
woman
in
another
moment
the
blade
would
have
been
dyed
in
her
blood
the
very
thought
of
it
was
horrible
in
maritza
face
there
was
no
look
of
triumph
if
for
a
moment
it
had
lightened
her
eyes
if
the
woman
power
over
the
man
defiantly
proclaimed
itself
as
she
tore
open
her
shirt
to
reveal
the
truth
it
was
gone
more
quickly
more
completely
perhaps
than
ellerey
anger
the
princess
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
you
will
not
strike
she
said
closing
the
shirt
again
with
hasty
fingers
regrets
are
useless
i
had
hoped
to
succeed
i
will
tell
you
why
when
you
choose
to
listen
to
me
you
can
deliver
me
to
the
brigands
until
then
i
am
grigosie
again
as
she
picked
up
her
cap
and
drew
it
over
her
curls
ellerey
looked
up
it
was
a
relief
to
see
the
lad
before
him
as
he
had
always
known
him
and
grigosie
talks
folly
he
said
i
would
far
sooner
take
his
life
myself
than
deliver
him
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
brigands
a
cry
from
stefan
which
was
half
an
oath
startled
them
and
in
an
instant
ellerey
had
sprung
to
the
soldier
side
anton
at
the
same
moment
seized
his
knife
and
all
three
men
were
in
the
doorway
slashing
and
thrusting
furiously
at
those
without
for
a
moment
there
were
only
two
or
three
who
had
approached
silently
but
their
shouts
upon
being
discovered
brought
a
crowd
rushing
to
their
assistance
when
anton
had
deserted
his
post
to
come
to
grigosie
help
the
temptation
to
secure
an
easy
victory
had
been
too
great
for
those
who
watched
the
plateau
vasilici
may
have
given
no
orders
that
the
truce
should
be
thus
flagrantly
broken
but
those
who
had
seized
the
opportunity
knew
well
enough
that
success
would
win
easy
forgiveness
as
it
had
been
at
the
gate
guarding
the
path
those
in
front
wounded
or
dying
were
thrown
back
upon
their
companions
impeding
the
rush
which
must
have
effected
an
entrance
perhaps
there
was
still
a
desire
among
most
of
them
to
let
any
comrade
who
would
force
himself
into
the
forefront
of
the
attack
the
prowess
of
the
defenders
had
already
taught
them
a
salutary
lesson
quick
stefan
see
that
the
door
will
close
and
fasten
whispered
ellerey
when
it
is
ready
shout
give
us
a
moment
to
thrust
back
the
foremost
of
them
and
a
moment
to
get
in
and
then
we
shut
them
out
if
we
can
stefan
made
a
sharp
cut
at
the
first
man
within
reach
of
him
and
then
slipped
back
into
the
tower
he
shouted
almost
immediately
for
grigosie
was
already
at
the
door
and
had
seen
that
it
was
in
working
order
at
the
shout
ellerey
and
anton
made
a
dash
out
as
if
in
a
last
attempt
for
freedom
a
slash
to
right
and
left
a
cringing
back
of
those
in
front
gave
them
the
opportunity
and
the
time
they
wanted
in
another
instant
they
were
within
the
tower
the
door
was
shut
and
the
great
bolts
in
it
shot
home
it
not
likely
we
be
using
this
way
out
for
a
while
said
ellerey
so
we
pile
everything
against
it
we
can
to
strengthen
it
they
worked
with
a
will
and
while
the
brigands
beat
at
the
door
without
they
barricaded
it
within
and
having
heaped
up
against
it
everything
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
they
drove
in
some
wooden
stakes
at
an
angle
to
hold
the
obstruction
in
its
place
and
resist
the
pressure
that
will
stop
them
for
a
little
while
said
ellerey
no
one
answered
him
as
soon
as
the
work
was
accomplished
grigosie
turned
away
and
stefan
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
brow
with
the
back
of
his
hand
looked
with
unutterable
fierceness
at
anton
you
you
and
then
he
burst
out
with
a
mighty
oath
there
no
word
in
devil
or
man
vocabulary
to
call
you
by
you
to
thank
for
this
were
you
ordered
to
keep
guard
by
the
barrier
yonder
let
him
be
stefan
said
ellerey
laying
his
hand
on
the
arm
he
did
rightly
in
leaving
it
he
came
to
protect
his
mistress
stefan
glanced
at
grigosie
whose
back
was
toward
him
and
muttered
something
deeply
oaths
they
may
have
been
but
the
words
seemed
to
lose
themselves
in
his
beard
anton
said
not
a
word
he
looked
at
ellerey
and
it
was
a
look
of
which
it
was
difficult
to
read
the
meaning
it
was
one
of
wonder
rather
than
of
gratitude
perhaps
he
was
trying
to
understand
the
real
character
of
this
strange
englishman
the
brigands
still
continued
to
hammer
at
the
door
but
it
showed
no
sign
of
giving
it
will
hold
for
a
time
said
ellerey
but
we
must
see
what
can
be
done
to
interrupt
their
attentions
as
much
as
possible
a
shot
or
two
from
the
chamber
above
might
help
them
to
become
quieter
come
stefan
and
let
us
see
what
we
can
do
in
the
chamber
above
there
were
narrow
slits
in
the
walls
and
the
top
of
the
was
commanded
from
this
vantage
place
but
those
immediately
below
were
out
of
danger
some
men
were
standing
by
the
barrier
and
stefan
wanted
to
fire
at
them
but
ellerey
stopped
him
their
ammunition
was
too
valuable
to
throw
away
a
cartridge
presently
might
be
worth
much
more
to
them
than
one
life
just
now
those
at
the
door
below
are
the
danger
said
ellerey
there
a
good
deal
of
loose
stonework
on
the
roof
said
stefan
a
piece
of
that
heaved
over
at
intervals
might
give
them
something
to
think
about
besides
hammering
at
that
door
they
shall
have
a
lesson
at
once
said
ellerey
climbing
carefully
up
the
broken
stairway
which
led
to
the
roof
it
has
been
said
that
a
turret
had
fallen
in
breaking
part
of
the
stairs
away
but
the
roof
could
easily
be
reached
there
were
many
fragments
some
large
some
small
lying
there
and
one
piece
of
considerable
size
ellerey
and
stefan
managed
to
get
on
to
the
wall
of
the
parapet
immediately
over
the
door
the
manoeuvre
was
apparently
unnoticed
for
there
came
no
warning
shout
to
those
below
over
with
it
said
ellerey
it
did
its
work
effectually
there
were
groans
and
execrations
and
several
bullets
struck
harmlessly
about
the
stonework
from
whence
this
message
had
been
hurled
but
the
hammering
at
the
door
ceased
and
the
besiegers
retired
to
a
safe
distance
we
must
keep
watch
from
here
captain
said
stefan
help
me
to
mount
another
piece
upon
the
wall
it
can
rest
there
until
they
get
courageous
again
and
ask
for
it
to
be
thrown
upon
them
ellerey
did
so
and
leaving
stefan
there
for
the
present
returned
to
the
basement
of
the
tower
anton
was
standing
in
exactly
the
same
place
as
when
ellerey
had
mounted
the
steps
but
the
expression
on
his
face
had
changed
it
was
quite
evident
that
in
the
interval
some
words
had
passed
between
him
and
grigosie
and
that
whatever
the
subject
of
the
conversation
anton
disapproved
of
it
grigosie
was
leaning
against
the
wall
counting
the
cartridges
he
still
had
in
his
possession
we
have
stopped
their
hammering
for
a
while
ellerey
said
while
the
loose
stones
on
the
roof
last
we
have
another
weapon
of
defence
do
i
relieve
stefan
asked
grigosie
no
anton
rest
while
you
can
there
will
be
little
enough
sleep
for
any
of
us
and
little
enough
food
too
said
grigosie
when
anton
had
cast
himself
down
in
a
corner
we
are
truly
in
a
sad
case
princess
grigosie
please
let
me
remain
grigosie
it
will
be
easier
for
both
of
us
she
crossed
over
to
the
steps
which
led
to
the
upper
chamber
and
sat
down
as
you
say
our
position
is
hopeless
grigosie
went
on
in
sturatzberg
there
are
some
who
would
strike
a
blow
for
maritza
but
no
one
knows
of
grigosie
it
is
a
poor
end
to
make
captain
i
have
had
my
moments
of
despair
but
whenever
i
have
thought
of
failure
i
have
never
pictured
such
a
miserable
failure
as
this
i
was
prepared
to
face
death
and
disaster
but
if
death
came
i
meant
that
it
should
be
glorious
that
it
should
come
in
a
fashion
to
set
europe
ringing
with
the
news
it
was
a
magnificent
setting
i
had
arranged
for
myself
the
going
down
of
a
sun
in
purple
and
red
and
gold
even
as
it
is
we
make
a
mountain
legend
of
it
said
ellerey
with
a
short
laugh
and
legend
lives
long
longer
than
fame
often
you
have
a
fair
chance
of
being
remembered
by
the
generations
to
come
i
have
brought
you
to
this
so
it
is
your
privilege
to
laugh
at
me
she
said
at
least
we
can
be
honest
with
each
other
now
said
ellerey
at
the
best
we
can
only
keep
these
wolves
at
bay
for
a
few
hours
though
these
old
walls
stand
we
have
little
food
little
ammunition
death
has
no
very
great
terrors
for
me
i
seem
to
have
lived
my
life
for
the
express
purpose
of
showing
how
a
man
can
fail
and
having
been
unjustly
robbed
of
my
honor
you
succeed
in
robbing
me
of
my
by
making
me
lift
my
hand
against
you
a
woman
i
am
sorry
question
me
as
you
will
how
could
you
hope
for
anything
else
but
failure
from
such
a
mad
enterprise
he
asked
captain
ellerey
do
you
remember
what
i
said
when
we
met
on
the
downs
that
day
every
word
that
i
spoke
truly
you
now
know
you
know
how
my
claim
stands
and
whether
you
love
my
cause
or
not
you
must
recognize
the
justice
of
it
while
i
was
in
england
kept
there
to
be
out
of
the
way
my
friends
were
working
in
sturatzberg
my
adherents
my
are
in
every
grade
of
society
there
but
there
was
one
man
on
whom
i
thoroughly
depended
he
was
in
constant
communication
with
me
and
one
of
his
great
schemes
a
plan
which
he
swore
was
ripening
every
day
was
getting
the
brigands
to
espouse
my
cause
to
these
hills
have
flocked
all
the
malcontents
of
the
country
they
are
not
robbers
they
are
political
outcasts
many
of
them
and
should
welcome
one
who
is
by
right
their
ruler
so
said
this
man
so
he
swore
they
were
ready
to
do
but
constantly
advised
a
little
further
delay
you
can
not
understand
what
this
waiting
day
after
day
month
after
month
meant
to
me
impatient
in
heart
i
was
yet
patient
in
action
i
might
still
be
quietly
waiting
but
for
two
things
first
i
learnt
that
to
be
put
further
out
of
the
way
i
was
to
visit
england
colonies
a
pleasure
trip
graciously
arranged
for
me
by
your
government
secondly
i
was
informed
that
the
man
i
trusted
was
scheming
for
his
own
ends
more
than
for
mine
it
was
the
parting
of
the
ways
captain
ellerey
and
i
had
to
choose
another
stepped
on
board
the
vessel
placed
at
my
disposal
in
my
stead
and
while
she
was
taken
to
the
colonies
i
came
secretly
to
sturatzberg
there
i
have
since
lived
watching
and
waiting
in
the
house
of
the
woman
who
devised
and
helped
me
to
carry
out
this
plan
a
woman
ellerey
exclaimed
countess
mavrodin
whose
power
is
only
the
greater
because
no
one
has
any
idea
of
its
existence
my
first
work
was
to
watch
the
man
whom
i
believed
had
been
working
for
me
i
quickly
found
that
my
interests
were
not
first
in
his
consideration
but
i
learned
also
that
he
feared
his
own
schemes
would
fail
should
some
unlucky
chance
bring
me
to
sturatzberg
in
this
fear
i
saw
my
hope
was
this
unnatural
is
this
man
de
froilette
asked
ellerey
he
is
the
man
unconscious
of
my
presence
in
the
city
he
continued
to
work
against
me
queen
elena
had
now
become
his
dupe
the
men
in
the
hills
would
help
to
set
her
alone
upon
the
throne
in
wallaria
and
the
king
once
got
rid
of
and
the
country
in
insurrection
de
froilette
would
have
sold
it
to
russia
more
would
have
aspired
to
the
hand
of
the
queen
perhaps
he
loves
her
perhaps
he
only
loves
the
power
he
would
gain
his
conspiracy
was
well
laid
and
he
only
wanted
a
man
to
lead
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
fight
to
pay
the
penalty
should
failure
come
while
he
remained
an
uninterested
citizen
ready
to
be
the
first
to
cry
out
against
the
rebellion
if
necessary
his
choice
fell
upon
desmond
ellerey
ellerey
did
not
answer
this
recital
was
making
many
things
clear
to
him
i
knew
something
of
this
captain
the
princess
went
on
in
my
heart
i
had
long
ago
chosen
him
to
lead
my
cause
i
tested
his
courage
on
the
night
i
believed
he
had
received
the
token
it
was
i
captain
ellerey
who
ran
with
you
along
the
deserted
streets
from
the
altstrasse
that
night
it
was
i
who
when
only
numbers
had
succeeded
in
binding
you
came
and
looked
into
your
eyes
and
was
satisfied
yet
you
did
trust
me
enough
to
whisper
your
name
said
ellerey
at
court
you
came
under
the
influence
of
frina
mavrodin
she
went
on
hastily
perhaps
even
with
her
my
cause
took
second
place
then
you
were
stanch
to
the
mission
you
had
undertaken
she
could
not
turn
you
from
that
although
she
influenced
you
in
another
way
what
do
you
mean
princess
i
have
heard
her
speak
of
you
i
have
noted
the
light
in
her
eyes
do
you
think
i
could
be
deceived
and
do
you
think
princess
that
i
have
no
memory
since
that
morning
on
the
downs
her
success
did
not
help
my
cause
therefore
what
was
it
to
me
cried
maritza
suddenly
starting
to
her
feet
it
was
time
for
me
to
act
you
know
the
rest
there
are
spies
everywhere
and
i
knew
when
the
token
was
given
how
it
was
sent
and
enclosed
in
a
similar
fashion
i
had
my
own
de
froilette
was
afraid
of
me
therefore
it
was
possible
that
the
brigands
or
some
of
them
at
least
were
ready
to
take
up
my
cause
the
wine
that
night
made
you
sleep
heavily
and
i
changed
the
tokens
there
is
a
loose
brick
in
yonder
corner
under
it
lies
the
queen
bracelet
of
medallions
so
captain
ellerey
you
have
me
in
your
power
i
brought
you
to
this
strait
the
remedy
is
in
your
own
hands
deliver
me
and
the
queen
token
into
vasilici
hands
and
who
knows
you
may
yet
win
place
and
power
in
sturatzberg
with
an
impatient
gesture
ellerey
walked
across
the
chamber
and
as
he
did
so
anton
raised
his
head
what
old
so
you
think
as
basely
of
me
as
your
mistress
does
he
said
noticing
the
sudden
movement
anton
did
not
answer
but
waited
resting
on
his
elbow
no
man
loves
being
fooled
princess
ellerey
went
on
turning
round
hastily
and
that
i
have
been
by
the
queen
by
de
froilette
and
by
you
but
of
them
all
you
only
have
insulted
me
what
contempt
must
you
have
for
me
to
think
even
of
such
a
thing
let
me
be
as
short
and
brutal
if
by
the
sacrifice
of
a
dog
to
those
wolves
without
i
could
purchase
my
freedom
i
would
not
buy
it
at
the
price
i
will
wake
you
presently
anton
you
at
least
i
can
understand
and
ellerey
mounted
the
steps
and
disappeared
into
the
upper
chamber
he
went
no
farther
for
a
time
but
sat
on
some
fallen
stones
to
think
and
his
thoughts
were
not
of
how
to
escape
from
his
enemies
nor
even
how
to
hold
them
at
bay
as
long
as
possible
but
of
two
women
one
a
woman
of
the
world
for
so
she
seemed
the
centre
of
attraction
beautiful
witty
frivolous
shimmering
in
silk
and
lace
and
jewels
jewels
that
were
no
brighter
than
her
eyes
he
had
not
mentioned
her
among
those
who
had
fooled
him
she
had
not
done
so
she
had
been
a
pleasant
companion
a
true
comrade
perhaps
indeed
was
ready
to
give
him
even
more
than
friendship
he
might
have
loved
her
but
for
the
other
woman
whom
he
saw
again
as
in
a
vision
standing
on
the
summit
of
the
downs
talking
of
empire
and
power
stirring
his
soul
from
its
lethargy
and
bidding
him
play
the
man
if
she
had
stirred
him
then
how
much
more
did
she
make
his
pulses
throb
now
now
that
she
had
shared
his
dangers
and
braved
so
much
had
she
any
memory
such
as
his
of
that
breezy
morning
long
ago
and
then
the
horror
of
the
present
overwhelmed
him
for
a
time
he
was
powerless
to
help
her
there
is
no
future
for
us
beyond
tomorrow
or
the
day
after
he
murmured
fate
has
strangely
linked
me
with
these
two
women
and
made
sport
of
me
one
might
have
loved
me
perchance
and
will
regret
me
the
other
i
love
and
she
cares
not
and
i
am
likely
to
lay
down
my
life
in
a
last
endeavor
to
save
her
thank
god
for
such
a
death
a
man
could
scarcely
die
a
better
one
although
stefan
would
hardly
think
so
and
he
climbed
to
the
roof
to
talk
to
the
soldier
there
princess
maritza
stood
for
some
time
where
ellerey
had
left
her
she
too
perhaps
forgot
the
present
for
a
little
while
and
her
thoughts
sped
to
frina
mavrodin
then
she
crossed
the
chamber
quickly
dumitru
are
you
asleep
no
princess
the
man
answered
starting
up
lie
down
again
dumitru
and
listen
if
he
comes
be
asleep
as
i
shall
feign
to
be
but
listen
and
if
you
do
not
understand
question
me
until
you
do
you
distrust
this
captain
princess
no
he
may
yet
do
good
work
for
us
for
a
long
time
she
continued
to
speak
in
a
whisper
it
is
madness
murmured
the
man
wise
men
would
call
all
i
have
done
madness
she
answered
listen
dumitru
there
is
more
when
she
had
finished
there
was
silence
you
would
have
me
play
the
traitor
said
the
man
slowly
he
is
never
a
traitor
who
obeys
the
word
of
his
sovereign
she
answered
but
princess
am
i
your
sovereign
dumitru
my
beloved
princess
indeed
then
obey
dumitru
act
promptly
when
i
give
the
word
it
shall
be
soon
perhaps
chapter
xx
treachery
or
sacrifice
all
that
night
the
stone
menacingly
balanced
on
the
wall
above
the
door
remained
in
its
place
the
brigands
had
no
desire
to
court
a
useless
death
and
they
could
afford
to
wait
at
dawn
ellerey
ascended
to
the
roof
of
the
tower
and
found
anton
pacing
its
narrow
limits
to
keep
the
warmth
in
his
limbs
nothing
happened
anton
nothing
captain
you
have
helped
your
mistress
into
a
desperate
strait
how
could
you
hope
for
anything
else
but
failure
the
princess
has
told
you
captain
aye
man
but
that
was
a
woman
hope
a
brave
one
if
you
will
but
there
was
no
weighing
of
chances
no
counting
the
cost
in
it
was
there
nothing
more
than
this
desperate
hope
at
the
back
of
your
mind
no
sane
man
reasoning
to
see
the
peril
of
it
i
am
but
a
servant
to
obey
anton
answered
yet
desperate
ventures
have
succeeded
and
we
had
honesty
on
our
side
captain
ours
is
the
just
cause
and
that
counts
for
something
no
wonder
princess
maritza
history
is
one
of
failure
if
her
counsellors
have
advised
after
this
manner
said
ellerey
are
you
certain
she
has
failed
captain
anton
asked
turning
quickly
toward
him
the
earnestness
of
the
question
added
to
its
seeming
absurdity
was
startling
could
there
be
any
doubt
of
the
failure
can
your
eyes
penetrate
beyond
the
spur
of
the
hills
yonder
and
see
an
army
marching
to
our
rescue
or
your
ears
catch
the
welcome
sound
of
tramping
feet
ellerey
said
pointing
to
the
head
of
the
pass
no
captain
is
there
any
hope
that
a
single
man
has
set
out
from
sturatzberg
to
help
us
i
know
of
none
was
the
answer
and
about
us
the
plateau
is
full
of
men
and
below
us
in
the
pass
men
wait
enemies
all
outside
this
tower
there
is
certain
death
for
us
and
within
there
is
food
enough
to
satisfy
one
man
for
a
day
perhaps
i
know
captain
and
yet
the
princess
may
not
have
failed
ellerey
did
not
answer
he
leant
against
the
parapet
watching
the
day
grow
brighter
and
anton
resumed
his
quick
pacing
to
and
fro
the
men
on
the
plateau
and
below
in
the
pass
were
beginning
to
stir
sentries
were
changed
there
was
the
murmur
of
voices
and
presently
rising
curls
of
faint
blue
smoke
from
fires
cooking
the
morning
meal
there
was
sunlight
on
the
higher
slopes
and
the
song
of
birds
in
the
air
a
welcome
new
day
to
myriads
of
creatures
on
the
earth
to
the
man
looking
out
across
the
panorama
of
mountain
peak
and
gorge
everything
seemed
a
mockery
there
was
something
cruel
in
gladdening
the
eyes
with
the
beauty
of
earth
and
sky
when
in
a
few
short
hours
those
eyes
must
close
forever
in
the
full
possession
of
his
life
and
strength
the
man
rebelled
against
his
fate
it
was
the
end
of
a
rat
in
a
trap
ignoble
inglorious
that
he
would
fall
in
striking
a
last
blow
for
a
woman
who
cared
naught
for
him
had
little
attraction
for
him
just
now
if
he
could
save
her
if
his
death
could
bring
some
good
thing
to
pass
it
would
be
different
once
or
twice
anton
stopped
in
his
pacing
backward
and
forward
to
look
steadily
toward
the
head
of
the
pass
can
you
hear
the
tramping
feet
ellerey
asked
when
he
stopped
again
no
captain
can
you
see
anything
no
captain
but
it
is
too
good
a
morning
to
accept
failure
the
sun
does
put
on
mourning
for
every
miserable
dog
that
dies
and
then
as
anton
resumed
his
walk
without
a
word
stefan
voice
was
heard
calling
ellerey
to
breakfast
all
the
stones
which
had
once
served
for
seats
and
a
table
had
been
piled
up
against
the
door
and
the
food
was
spread
in
a
little
circle
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
it
was
stefan
arrangement
he
had
refused
all
help
from
the
princess
gruffly
but
firmly
although
the
gruffness
may
have
been
something
less
than
his
usual
manner
and
intended
for
courtesy
maritza
stood
with
her
hands
behind
her
watching
him
a
smile
upon
her
lips
there
more
table
than
breakfast
captain
he
said
as
ellerey
came
down
but
it
as
well
to
have
things
orderly
there
little
enough
to
say
grace
for
but
there
a
lesson
in
the
display
for
all
that
it
represents
all
that
stands
between
us
and
starvation
with
care
stefan
we
can
live
for
and
then
ellerey
paused
quite
so
captain
i
been
trying
to
fix
a
limit
myself
and
failed
ellerey
looked
at
the
scraps
of
food
at
any
other
time
he
would
have
spurned
them
as
a
meal
of
any
sort
but
in
such
a
case
as
theirs
was
morsels
of
food
bulk
large
with
possibilities
and
perhaps
he
muttered
yes
we
be
quite
ready
to
welcome
a
change
of
diet
by
night
said
stefan
and
for
my
part
i
should
quarrel
with
any
kind
of
food
and
drink
which
happened
to
arrive
sooner
there
no
drawing
from
the
mountain
stream
now
and
the
flasks
hold
little
much
may
happen
in
two
days
said
maritza
quietly
true
they
may
storm
the
tower
successfully
and
put
us
beyond
the
want
of
food
before
night
ellerey
answered
they
ate
their
small
portions
in
silence
and
having
eaten
them
remained
silent
each
one
was
conscious
that
there
was
something
to
be
said
yet
each
one
waited
for
the
other
to
say
it
captain
it
was
a
relief
to
hear
stefan
voice
and
ellerey
looked
up
captain
i
make
no
claim
to
be
much
of
a
man
at
giving
advice
i
seldom
been
asked
for
it
and
i
usually
been
in
a
large
enough
company
for
it
to
be
done
without
but
as
we
are
i
take
it
each
one
of
us
becomes
of
more
importance
than
under
ordinary
circumstances
ellerey
nodded
well
then
my
case
is
this
years
ago
someone
found
me
in
the
streets
and
for
some
reason
known
only
to
themselves
decided
that
i
should
live
i
may
have
been
hungry
then
i
do
remember
but
i
never
been
hungry
since
i
may
have
had
to
steal
my
victuals
but
anyway
i
got
them
it
follows
therefore
that
in
fighting
hunger
i
not
to
be
depended
on
the
weapons
in
use
for
such
a
fray
are
new
to
me
and
i
do
know
how
to
handle
them
i
afraid
of
the
enemy
well
stefan
now
death
i
suppose
is
as
certain
within
the
next
few
hours
as
anything
well
can
be
and
i
should
like
to
meet
the
kind
of
death
i
understand
let
us
fix
a
time
for
hauling
down
the
barricade
and
then
make
a
dash
for
it
we
get
as
far
as
the
path
perhaps
there
is
just
a
chance
that
some
of
us
may
get
farther
but
anyhow
we
die
in
the
open
have
you
thought
of
the
princess
ellerey
asked
the
circumstances
do
make
it
easy
to
forget
her
stefan
answered
nor
difficult
to
hate
her
said
maritza
i
took
a
kind
of
liking
to
grigosie
which
somehow
keeps
me
back
from
hating
her
stefan
went
on
speaking
to
ellerey
and
not
looking
at
the
princess
i
do
suppose
however
that
she
knows
much
more
about
starvation
than
i
do
and
dying
in
the
open
may
suit
her
case
as
well
as
mine
but
a
woman
stefan
i
naught
to
do
with
women
captain
and
i
see
none
in
our
company
i
only
see
two
good
comrades
before
me
one
lacking
a
bit
of
muscle
it
may
be
but
lacking
no
courage
he
shall
go
between
us
and
anton
shall
cover
our
rear
there
such
pleasure
in
the
thought
of
striking
another
blow
that
there
even
a
hope
in
it
that
we
may
win
though
stefan
is
right
maritza
said
let
us
make
the
attempt
why
not
stefan
asked
the
food
is
not
all
gone
she
said
besides
the
day
holds
possibilities
let
us
wait
a
day
captain
if
the
attempt
is
to
be
made
why
not
make
it
the
darkness
will
help
us
said
ellerey
i
prefer
dying
in
the
sunlight
said
stefan
but
so
long
as
i
die
in
the
open
the
stars
will
serve
in
the
night
if
you
will
but
not
pleaded
maritza
laying
her
hand
on
ellerey
arm
let
it
be
night
hope
dies
hard
with
you
princess
i
have
a
fancy
to
look
upon
another
dawn
she
returned
perhaps
is
the
anniversary
of
some
great
event
in
my
history
and
that
is
why
i
long
to
see
it
i
do
not
know
but
in
us
all
there
is
a
vein
of
superstition
i
will
go
and
relieve
anton
stefan
watched
her
as
she
went
up
the
stairs
and
disappeared
into
the
upper
chamber
if
anyone
could
make
me
change
my
opinion
of
women
she
would
he
said
but
ellerey
took
no
notice
of
the
remark
he
had
commenced
walking
up
and
down
deep
in
thought
the
day
passed
quietly
the
brigands
made
no
attempt
to
storm
the
tower
and
the
huge
stone
above
the
doorway
remained
balanced
on
the
wall
but
to
those
within
the
hours
dragged
heavily
stefan
spent
his
time
feeling
the
edge
of
his
sword
and
seeing
that
the
revolvers
were
in
good
order
and
loaded
the
occupation
seemed
to
bring
him
nearer
to
his
emancipation
ellerey
walked
from
wall
to
wall
turning
with
the
regularity
of
a
wild
beast
in
a
cage
a
dozen
times
or
more
he
climbed
to
the
roof
but
hardly
spoke
a
word
to
whoever
happened
to
be
sentry
there
maritza
lay
down
and
appeared
to
sleep
a
good
deal
when
her
duty
on
the
roof
was
over
for
she
demanded
to
take
her
turn
with
the
rest
and
anton
was
restless
and
nervous
he
lay
down
but
he
did
not
sleep
his
eyes
were
constantly
on
the
princess
you
know
what
we
have
decided
said
ellerey
to
him
during
the
day
yes
captain
you
have
no
better
plan
no
captain
so
that
i
die
with
her
i
am
content
the
day
drew
slowly
to
its
ending
a
blazed
upon
the
plateau
and
two
in
the
pass
below
around
which
the
besiegers
gathered
still
there
were
no
signs
that
an
attack
was
meditated
and
ellerey
watched
the
moving
figures
for
a
long
time
and
marked
the
position
of
the
sentries
such
knowledge
might
prove
useful
night
and
he
determined
which
direction
to
take
should
providence
so
far
favor
them
as
to
allow
them
to
gain
the
pass
it
was
a
relief
to
find
even
this
employment
to
occupy
his
mind
after
the
weary
day
the
night
was
almost
welcome
first
stefan
then
ellerey
had
watched
through
the
early
hours
now
anton
paced
the
roof
restlessly
while
maritza
still
slept
she
was
to
go
on
duty
at
dawn
so
might
she
see
the
new
day
break
as
she
wished
when
ellerey
came
down
stefan
was
sleeping
heavily
and
the
princess
lay
in
her
corner
with
her
arm
under
her
head
a
picture
of
graceful
repose
and
rest
the
thought
of
the
certain
death
that
awaited
her
made
ellerey
sick
almost
and
with
a
shudder
and
a
curse
at
his
own
impotence
he
cast
himself
down
for
a
time
he
tossed
and
turned
restlessly
this
way
and
that
until
utterly
wearied
out
sleep
fell
upon
him
and
held
him
fast
smoothing
the
care
from
his
face
with
pleasant
dreams
now
he
climbed
a
stretch
of
sunny
downs
the
song
of
a
lark
and
the
sighing
sound
of
the
long
waving
grass
in
his
ears
now
he
heard
the
rustle
of
silk
beside
him
and
a
sweet
low
voice
and
pleasant
laughter
answered
him
a
little
foot
stepped
out
bravely
beside
his
own
and
a
little
hand
rested
confidently
in
his
there
was
music
and
laughter
about
him
and
then
a
sudden
pause
and
darkness
and
out
of
it
a
sharp
crackling
sound
what
was
that
ellerey
had
started
up
only
half
awake
it
was
stefan
sudden
question
which
thoroughly
aroused
him
the
dawn
had
come
and
a
dim
light
was
in
the
chamber
strangely
dim
and
sombre
after
the
light
and
movement
in
his
dream
he
looked
across
at
maritza
corner
and
saw
that
it
was
empty
we
have
slept
soundly
stefan
he
said
springing
to
his
feet
the
princess
has
gone
on
duty
it
sounded
like
revolver
shots
to
me
the
soldier
answered
as
he
followed
ellerey
quickly
to
the
roof
they
stepped
from
the
broken
stairs
into
the
open
and
then
stood
still
turning
to
look
at
each
other
there
was
no
one
there
the
stone
still
rested
on
the
wall
and
a
rope
which
had
been
in
the
lower
chamber
lay
sprawling
over
the
roof
one
end
of
it
hanging
a
few
feet
over
the
parapet
both
men
ran
to
the
wall
together
the
plateau
was
empty
not
a
man
remained
there
no
sentry
paced
along
the
edge
of
it
no
one
stood
there
at
the
head
of
the
path
gone
ellerey
exclaimed
it
was
not
of
the
brigands
he
was
thinking
and
stefan
knew
it
by
that
rope
and
anton
too
maybe
we
woke
none
too
soon
captain
and
then
as
ellerey
turned
questioning
eyes
to
him
he
added
the
look
of
treachery
in
this
ellerey
did
not
answer
but
the
question
asked
a
moment
later
showed
the
direction
his
thoughts
were
taking
have
they
really
gone
he
said
pointing
to
the
plateau
the
soldier
shook
his
head
doubtfully
and
then
suddenly
leant
forward
his
hand
stretched
out
toward
the
pass
before
them
look
yonder
the
light
was
growing
stronger
every
moment
and
the
moving
figures
in
the
valley
could
be
seen
distinctly
there
was
more
going
forward
there
than
the
awakening
of
a
camp
to
a
new
day
the
men
were
moving
in
orderly
groups
and
there
was
no
curling
smoke
from
fires
they
are
on
the
march
captain
and
look
is
not
the
lad
in
the
midst
of
them
ellerey
eyes
might
not
have
served
him
to
pick
out
the
slim
figure
but
thus
directed
he
had
no
doubt
it
was
the
princess
in
the
midst
of
the
men
who
marched
quickly
along
the
pass
for
a
little
way
and
then
turned
aside
and
seemed
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
foot
of
the
mountain
opposite
she
could
not
have
gone
of
her
own
accord
stefan
they
must
have
found
means
to
capture
her
anton
may
have
helped
them
perhaps
no
he
was
faithful
my
life
on
that
great
heavens
she
is
in
their
power
in
vasilici
power
and
we
stand
here
doing
nothing
she
may
have
gone
willingly
said
stefan
as
ellerey
rushed
toward
the
steps
besides
what
can
we
do
come
or
stay
as
you
will
ellerey
shouted
as
he
disappeared
she
went
willingly
stefan
murmured
lingering
behind
for
a
moment
to
look
at
the
rope
at
least
she
climbed
down
to
them
not
they
up
to
her
i
never
trusted
anton
if
i
had
taken
a
liking
to
grigosie
i
should
trust
the
princess
she
a
woman
although
only
a
few
moments
had
elapsed
ellerey
was
already
throwing
down
the
barricade
at
the
door
in
the
lower
chamber
of
the
tower
stefan
first
looked
at
his
weapons
and
then
went
across
to
the
corner
which
the
princess
had
occupied
ellerey
did
not
notice
him
and
he
rose
from
his
knees
there
only
as
ellerey
had
sufficiently
thrown
down
the
stones
to
draw
back
the
bolt
and
open
the
door
wide
enough
to
get
out
one
moment
captain
i
am
with
you
but
be
prepared
for
attack
ellerey
sword
in
one
hand
revolver
in
the
other
rushed
out
on
to
the
plateau
stefan
at
his
heels
no
shout
rang
out
no
man
sprang
from
his
among
the
ruins
to
bar
their
way
even
the
valley
was
empty
the
last
of
the
men
who
had
encamped
there
had
been
swallowed
up
by
the
mountain
opposite
captain
the
token
which
the
princess
said
was
hidden
under
the
loose
brick
yonder
is
gone
the
sword
which
ellerey
held
ready
to
defend
himself
fell
suddenly
almost
as
it
had
done
when
he
recognized
that
he
had
raised
it
against
a
woman
shame
had
sent
the
color
to
his
cheeks
then
and
the
color
came
into
his
face
now
anger
bringing
it
there
had
she
deceived
from
first
to
last
played
carelessly
with
all
the
finer
feelings
that
were
in
him
using
them
boldly
and
deliberately
for
her
own
end
these
were
the
thoughts
which
ran
swiftly
through
his
mind
and
well
might
they
stir
him
to
anger
then
came
the
reaction
suddenly
swiftly
no
she
could
not
have
deceived
him
in
this
manner
there
was
some
reason
for
her
going
something
unforeseen
had
happened
after
all
they
had
come
through
together
she
could
not
be
guilty
of
treachery
you
found
nothing
else
he
asked
hoarsely
yes
this
a
piece
of
stone
lay
upon
it
to
keep
it
in
its
place
close
to
where
she
slept
last
night
ellerey
seized
the
scrap
of
paper
stefan
held
out
to
him
i
have
brought
you
to
this
he
read
written
faintly
in
pencil
i
have
thought
of
a
plan
to
save
you
at
dawn
i
shall
have
gone
but
so
will
the
brigands
you
will
be
free
to
go
to
sturatzberg
if
you
will
or
across
the
mountains
northward
to
safety
i
wonder
which
way
you
will
take
mine
is
a
desperate
venture
if
i
fail
think
of
me
sometimes
for
to
me
also
there
has
often
come
the
memory
of
that
breezy
morning
in
england
maritza
look
captain
stefan
cried
on
the
slope
of
the
opposite
hills
where
the
path
rose
over
a
spur
a
party
of
the
marching
brigands
had
come
into
view
the
sunlight
had
come
and
it
touched
the
men
as
they
went
the
distance
was
too
great
to
distinguish
the
slim
figure
in
the
midst
but
one
spot
of
white
showed
clearly
quivering
as
the
sunlight
touched
it
for
a
moment
it
disappeared
then
it
fluttered
again
and
as
ellerey
looked
a
crowd
of
conflicting
thoughts
and
emotions
were
in
his
brain
this
was
not
treachery
but
sacrifice
a
waving
handkerchief
captain
a
signal
of
farewell
stefan
murmured
in
a
low
gruff
voice
chapter
xxi
the
rescue
the
white
signal
had
gone
but
ellerey
eyes
remained
fixed
upon
the
moving
black
line
until
a
fold
in
the
hills
hid
it
from
sight
something
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
his
life
suddenly
as
a
candle
is
blown
out
in
a
room
then
he
turned
and
held
out
the
paper
to
the
soldier
stefan
read
the
pencilled
lines
turned
the
paper
over
meditatively
and
then
read
them
again
the
words
seemed
to
burn
their
way
into
his
brain
as
they
had
burnt
into
ellerey
but
the
effect
was
somewhat
different
it
is
not
like
a
woman
is
it
said
stefan
very
like
i
think
stefan
shook
his
head
as
though
he
regretted
his
companion
ignorance
i
took
a
liking
to
grigosie
he
said
i
saw
the
making
of
a
grand
comrade
in
grigosie
i
can
understand
his
doing
this
kind
of
thing
but
not
a
woman
the
fact
remains
that
she
is
a
woman
said
ellerey
wonderful
answered
the
soldier
as
he
handed
back
the
paper
it
would
appear
that
the
making
of
a
man
rests
much
in
his
clothes
never
known
good
come
from
a
petticoat
grigosie
did
wear
one
maybe
he
recognized
that
he
was
a
man
hidden
by
a
cruel
mistake
in
the
shape
of
a
woman
ah
captain
women
have
had
the
spoiling
of
many
a
good
man
i
drunk
with
and
fought
beside
i
wish
you
a
better
fate
than
theirs
this
does
not
look
like
treachery
said
ellerey
it
was
evident
that
he
had
not
been
attending
to
his
companion
but
had
been
following
out
a
train
of
thought
of
his
own
and
now
put
his
decision
into
words
we
standing
here
like
two
fools
at
any
rate
stefan
said
we
ought
to
know
the
value
of
precaution
by
this
time
what
is
to
be
done
captain
are
you
for
sturatzberg
or
for
crossing
the
mountains
northward
it
a
speedy
making
up
our
minds
that
is
needed
if
we
are
not
to
starve
ellerey
was
still
following
his
own
thoughts
what
can
her
plan
be
he
said
what
hope
for
her
cause
is
there
in
these
hills
what
mercy
can
she
expect
from
vasilici
as
grigosie
none
as
a
woman
she
may
persuade
these
men
to
anything
stefan
answered
some
power
she
has
or
why
did
they
not
kill
grigosie
at
once
it
is
a
terrible
thought
stefan
but
may
they
not
have
reserved
her
for
vasilici
vengeance
did
they
not
cry
to
us
that
we
might
go
free
if
the
lad
were
given
up
she
heard
that
she
argued
with
us
you
remember
she
has
sacrificed
herself
for
us
well
captain
shall
we
follow
give
me
but
leave
to
kill
something
on
the
way
and
get
on
friendly
terms
with
my
stomach
i
care
not
which
road
we
take
nor
to
what
it
leads
us
we
will
follow
her
said
ellerey
i
never
leave
so
good
a
comrade
as
grigosie
in
a
tight
place
murmured
stefan
keep
watch
captain
while
i
gather
up
what
we
take
with
us
and
fill
our
flasks
at
grigosie
fairy
fountain
yonder
when
stefan
returned
he
found
ellerey
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
plateau
looking
down
into
the
pass
what
is
it
captain
he
called
out
as
he
came
they
have
not
kept
their
promise
stefan
that
is
all
ellerey
answered
pointing
down
into
the
valley
a
savage
oath
burst
from
stefan
lips
they
played
the
lad
false
in
this
they
play
him
false
in
all
and
the
tone
in
which
he
said
it
revealed
for
a
moment
the
real
heart
of
the
man
hidden
deep
down
under
this
rough
exterior
from
a
hidden
pathway
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
the
brigands
came
out
singly
fourscore
of
them
at
least
each
man
looked
up
at
the
plateau
as
he
issued
from
the
path
and
the
manner
in
which
his
eager
steps
gave
way
at
once
to
an
easier
and
more
slouching
gait
showed
plainly
enough
that
the
object
of
their
coming
had
been
attained
that
no
further
hurry
was
necessary
some
went
to
the
places
where
the
fires
had
been
and
kicked
the
ashes
together
while
others
stacked
their
arms
and
sat
down
in
twos
and
threes
along
the
pass
those
were
revolver
shots
that
woke
us
captain
said
stefan
thoughtfully
i
expect
grigosie
meant
to
rouse
us
as
soon
as
we
could
no
longer
prevent
his
going
and
intended
us
to
make
the
best
of
our
chances
and
we
missed
them
said
ellerey
i
fancy
this
is
meant
to
be
our
last
adventure
stefan
they
come
up
the
path
presently
and
the
sooner
the
better
was
the
answer
a
few
of
them
shall
finish
their
adventures
along
with
us
but
we
fight
our
last
fight
here
captain
not
in
the
tower
yonder
i
have
a
sudden
lust
for
life
stefan
a
longing
to
be
face
to
face
with
vasilici
once
more
whispered
ellerey
as
though
he
imagined
the
men
in
the
valley
below
might
hear
his
secret
if
we
wait
until
sundown
we
might
get
through
them
in
the
darkness
our
original
plan
stefan
answered
i
am
with
you
captain
and
if
you
will
watch
those
blackguards
yonder
i
turn
my
attention
to
a
bird
that
hovering
on
the
mountain
above
heaven
grant
he
comes
within
range
and
an
empty
stomach
does
not
put
my
eye
out
but
the
bird
seemed
to
have
no
more
intention
of
serving
two
hungry
men
for
food
than
the
brigands
meant
to
throw
away
their
lives
by
an
attempt
to
win
the
plateau
they
posted
sentinels
one
near
the
foot
of
the
path
and
one
beyond
the
toward
the
head
of
the
pass
the
rest
sat
or
stood
at
their
ease
between
these
two
points
and
unless
they
changed
their
plan
at
night
ellerey
perceived
that
if
the
sentry
at
the
foot
of
the
path
were
once
silenced
without
being
able
to
give
warning
the
road
to
the
way
taken
by
the
princess
and
her
captors
would
be
clear
he
studied
the
shape
of
the
hills
and
the
distance
carefully
so
that
he
might
the
more
easily
find
that
road
and
he
noticed
how
long
a
time
elapsed
between
the
relief
of
the
sentries
if
they
attacked
the
man
soon
after
his
coming
on
duty
so
much
the
longer
start
would
they
obtain
the
day
wore
on
and
he
and
stefan
finished
the
scraps
of
food
which
were
left
and
thanked
their
good
fortune
that
they
had
not
the
terrors
of
thirst
to
face
stefan
still
watched
the
mountains
above
for
a
bird
and
ellerey
planned
the
work
of
the
night
in
every
detail
explaining
some
new
point
to
the
soldier
every
time
he
approached
him
he
had
paid
little
attention
to
the
men
in
the
valley
below
for
some
time
when
he
was
startled
by
a
single
shot
which
rang
out
clearly
in
the
still
air
for
a
moment
he
thought
that
stefan
had
got
his
bird
at
last
but
the
next
instant
the
soldier
was
beside
him
as
startled
as
he
was
it
was
the
sentry
toward
the
head
of
the
pass
who
had
fired
and
he
now
came
rushing
toward
his
companions
who
quickly
seized
their
weapons
do
i
hear
horses
exclaimed
stefan
excitedly
by
the
father
and
mother
i
never
knew
there
are
horses
galloping
up
the
pass
there
are
several
of
them
and
they
come
quickly
the
brigands
were
evidently
unprepared
for
such
an
attack
and
did
not
appear
to
have
a
capable
leader
among
them
they
had
not
come
there
to
fight
only
to
starve
two
men
into
surrender
and
as
they
ran
together
there
was
a
general
movement
toward
the
path
they
had
come
into
the
pass
galloped
some
two
dozen
horsemen
who
at
a
sign
from
their
leader
drew
rein
upon
seeing
the
brigands
and
turned
to
shout
to
others
who
had
not
yet
come
into
view
an
advance
guard
only
muttered
stefan
the
brigands
evidently
thought
the
same
and
those
who
could
not
reach
the
mountain
path
in
time
began
a
hasty
retreat
up
the
pass
firing
in
a
desultory
manner
as
they
went
they
had
no
intention
of
attempting
to
hold
their
position
safety
was
all
they
cared
about
the
horsemen
paused
a
moment
to
fire
a
volley
and
then
charged
but
there
was
little
fighting
two
or
three
of
the
brigands
were
cut
down
and
one
horseman
pitched
forward
suddenly
as
a
bullet
brought
his
horse
to
the
ground
but
that
was
all
the
brigands
scrambled
into
the
mountain
paths
or
up
the
mountain
slope
out
of
reach
and
the
leader
of
the
troop
checked
any
pursuit
of
those
who
were
fleeing
rapidly
up
the
pass
is
this
a
rescue
or
have
we
only
changed
our
enemy
said
ellerey
they
are
dismounting
and
will
come
up
the
way
we
had
better
meet
them
at
the
top
of
it
said
stefan
only
one
man
came
up
to
them
there
is
not
much
distinction
to
be
had
from
routing
such
an
enemy
captain
ellerey
he
said
baron
petrescu
at
your
service
although
barely
recovered
from
the
effects
of
our
last
meeting
time
pressed
so
i
did
not
wait
for
a
doctor
certificate
of
fitness
i
thank
you
but
i
hardly
understand
the
situation
baron
said
ellerey
and
that
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
was
the
answer
but
there
will
be
time
to
explain
presently
enough
that
we
can
shake
hands
over
a
past
quarrel
for
which
i
have
paid
the
penalty
and
know
that
we
stand
together
now
ellerey
took
his
outstretched
hand
without
a
word
the
princess
is
with
you
petrescu
asked
she
was
until
this
morning
killed
cried
the
baron
no
and
yet
i
do
not
know
that
worse
has
not
happened
to
her
while
you
explain
captain
have
i
your
leave
to
go
down
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
our
new
comrades
said
stefan
my
stomach
yearns
toward
them
and
their
victuals
and
drink
i
had
forgotten
said
the
baron
hastily
you
can
explain
while
we
eat
and
drink
captain
a
few
moments
will
make
no
difference
baron
said
ellerey
nodding
a
consent
to
stefan
who
went
down
into
the
pass
quickly
then
he
went
on
do
you
know
the
princess
plans
baron
i
thought
i
did
but
her
sudden
disappearance
from
sturatzberg
was
unexpected
by
me
still
i
know
enough
of
your
mission
to
guess
her
reason
for
joining
you
then
baron
you
know
my
position
it
was
not
princess
maritza
cause
which
brought
me
to
these
hills
i
am
the
victim
of
a
conspiracy
but
at
the
same
time
my
only
thought
now
is
for
the
safety
of
the
princess
the
baron
nodded
and
glanced
swiftly
at
his
companion
i
understand
captain
shortly
ellerey
told
him
what
had
occurred
since
princess
maritza
had
joined
him
at
the
toison
reserving
nothing
not
even
his
own
anger
at
the
deceit
which
had
been
practised
upon
him
it
was
a
desperate
enterprise
doomed
to
failure
from
the
beginning
he
went
on
but
as
it
was
only
one
course
was
open
to
me
to
protect
the
princess
to
the
best
of
my
ability
our
food
was
gone
and
we
had
determined
to
make
a
dash
for
safety
after
dark
that
we
did
not
do
so
last
night
was
by
the
princess
desire
her
going
must
have
been
in
her
mind
then
she
took
the
bracelet
of
medallions
with
her
said
petrescu
thoughtfully
she
told
me
it
was
in
the
tower
yonder
it
is
not
there
now
so
i
presume
she
took
it
it
may
possibly
secure
her
safety
vasilici
is
a
truculent
villain
ellerey
answered
he
is
not
likely
to
forget
or
forgive
that
shot
which
saved
my
life
then
you
would
follow
her
stefan
and
i
had
decided
to
do
so
when
those
fellows
stole
back
to
prevent
us
we
should
have
taken
our
chance
after
dark
petrescu
was
thoughtful
for
a
time
i
hardly
know
what
course
to
advise
he
said
presently
we
may
not
be
able
to
help
her
much
in
these
hills
while
in
sturatzberg
we
might
stir
up
the
people
in
her
cause
at
least
i
have
small
power
in
the
city
said
ellerey
with
a
smile
those
who
trusted
me
very
naturally
think
me
a
traitor
and
i
should
quickly
be
delivered
over
to
enemies
who
would
make
short
work
of
me
yet
you
have
powerful
friends
there
indeed
when
the
men
who
deserted
you
rode
into
the
city
with
stories
of
your
treachery
captain
ellerey
name
suddenly
became
known
to
hundreds
who
had
never
heard
it
before
and
to
each
one
of
them
he
became
a
friend
since
his
fate
was
linked
with
princess
maritza
would
such
friendship
protect
me
from
my
enemies
at
least
many
a
in
the
city
would
be
open
to
you
and
some
men
might
sooner
give
up
their
lives
than
betray
you
there
is
one
proof
of
the
truth
of
what
i
say
the
men
who
deserted
you
all
died
a
violent
death
that
night
they
were
found
lying
side
by
side
in
the
bergenstrasse
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
city
was
patrolled
by
troops
ellerey
looked
at
him
inquiringly
no
captain
i
was
not
privy
to
their
assassination
although
i
might
make
a
shrewd
guess
in
what
quarter
the
plot
originated
then
sturatzberg
is
in
uproar
no
it
is
strangely
quiet
all
things
considered
that
quiet
which
presages
a
storm
the
king
would
strike
if
he
knew
where
to
strike
but
he
hardly
knows
who
are
his
enemies
the
sight
of
me
would
give
him
some
idea
where
to
aim
a
blow
said
ellerey
yes
and
yet
he
might
think
twice
before
striking
it
you
have
powerful
friends
one
very
powerful
friend
one
very
powerful
friend
you
do
not
mean
her
majesty
i
think
you
know
i
do
not
captain
ellerey
the
baron
answered
it
was
the
countess
mavrodin
who
bid
me
come
i
know
that
the
cause
of
princess
maritza
is
dear
to
her
said
ellerey
quietly
it
is
and
to
me
said
the
baron
and
yet
we
are
probably
not
doing
the
best
for
it
by
bringing
two
dozen
horsemen
into
the
hills
there
are
no
more
behind
our
calling
back
as
though
there
were
was
a
stratagem
to
strike
greater
terror
into
the
brigands
no
captain
the
countess
bid
me
come
to
rescue
the
princess
and
you
to
aid
your
escape
out
of
wallaria
if
need
be
and
her
command
is
my
law
do
we
understand
each
other
captain
ellerey
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
for
a
moment
do
you
understand
why
i
forced
a
duel
upon
you
petrescu
went
on
i
might
tell
you
that
i
believed
the
queen
token
was
in
your
possession
it
would
be
true
but
that
was
not
uppermost
in
my
thoughts
when
we
stood
face
to
face
therefore
when
i
come
to
you
at
her
bidding
you
may
well
trust
me
since
i
have
little
to
win
by
it
only
partly
do
i
understand
you
baron
you
northmen
in
spite
of
your
many
virtues
are
slower
to
understand
than
we
southerners
are
would
you
have
me
pluck
the
fruit
for
you
as
well
as
show
you
the
tree
sturatzberg
may
be
in
open
rebellion
before
a
week
is
out
and
frina
mavrodin
may
have
to
leave
it
i
will
say
no
more
even
my
generosity
has
a
limit
ellerey
could
not
fail
to
understand
his
meaning
you
had
better
read
that
baron
he
said
handing
him
letter
petrescu
took
the
scrap
of
paper
and
read
it
carefully
i
met
maritza
long
ago
in
england
he
said
as
petrescu
looked
at
him
she
has
remembered
it
you
see
and
i
i
came
to
sturatzberg
then
the
countess
is
my
friend
but
maritza
waste
precious
time
baron
i
must
follow
maritza
i
understand
come
and
eat
we
must
lose
no
time
it
was
arranged
to
leave
some
of
the
men
in
charge
of
the
tower
and
of
the
horses
they
were
to
wait
there
six
days
and
if
by
that
time
baron
petrescu
and
his
party
had
not
returned
they
were
to
go
back
to
sturatzberg
taking
a
circuitous
road
to
avoid
the
soldiers
encamped
in
the
plain
stefan
was
left
in
command
of
these
men
since
he
had
had
experience
how
the
plateau
could
best
be
defended
in
case
of
need
that
the
brigands
would
attack
them
however
seemed
unlikely
for
they
had
evidently
fled
in
the
belief
that
the
men
they
had
seen
were
only
an
advance
guard
night
was
falling
when
the
party
well
armed
and
full
of
excitement
set
out
there
was
a
silver
light
behind
the
distant
heights
herald
of
the
moon
so
there
was
little
need
to
wait
for
the
dawn
besides
one
of
the
brigands
had
only
been
slightly
wounded
and
was
pressed
into
their
service
as
guide
he
loudly
declared
that
he
had
no
idea
where
his
chief
was
hiding
until
the
baron
held
a
revolver
to
his
head
and
gave
him
half
a
minute
to
find
whether
his
memory
could
not
be
jogged
sufficiently
to
serve
him
better
before
the
thirty
seconds
had
passed
it
had
worked
to
good
effect
and
he
set
out
with
a
man
on
either
side
of
him
who
had
strict
injunctions
to
see
that
he
should
be
the
first
to
pay
for
any
treachery
which
might
happen
some
of
the
brigands
can
not
be
far
in
front
of
us
said
the
baron
and
this
fellow
will
know
their
likely
haunt
and
give
us
warning
in
time
if
he
forgets
to
do
so
the
sun
will
rise
in
vain
for
him
they
tramped
silently
through
the
night
often
in
single
file
for
the
way
contracted
often
to
the
narrowest
of
defiles
that
they
had
started
right
ellerey
knew
and
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
so
far
their
guide
had
not
misled
them
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
way
by
which
they
could
have
come
just
before
dawn
the
brigand
stopped
his
memory
had
been
excellently
aroused
we
approach
an
open
space
where
my
people
sometimes
halt
he
said
two
men
were
sent
forward
to
reconnoitre
but
found
the
place
empty
and
here
they
halted
how
much
farther
to
where
vasilici
is
asked
petrescu
we
should
reach
the
place
by
noon
the
brigand
answered
but
he
may
have
moved
my
comrades
will
have
told
him
of
your
coming
to
the
pass
i
dare
say
you
will
remember
where
he
is
likely
to
have
removed
to
the
baron
returned
since
your
miserable
life
depends
upon
it
they
were
just
preparing
to
continue
their
journey
after
a
short
rest
and
hasty
meal
when
they
heard
the
sound
of
falling
footsteps
coming
rapidly
toward
them
only
one
man
and
he
was
running
with
that
easy
measured
stride
which
a
runner
falls
into
when
his
journey
is
likely
to
be
a
long
one
a
moment
later
he
ran
into
the
midst
of
them
stop
cried
several
voices
the
man
with
a
glance
to
right
and
left
of
him
for
a
way
of
escape
stood
still
but
in
an
instant
a
knife
gleamed
in
his
hand
and
in
that
moment
ellerey
recognized
him
anton
the
man
turned
toward
him
and
lowered
the
knife
at
once
the
princess
anton
where
is
she
yonder
alive
anton
answered
give
me
a
moment
and
some
drink
i
have
a
message
for
me
for
all
captain
who
love
her
chapter
xxii
in
vasilici
stronghold
although
anton
had
declared
to
ellerey
that
there
was
no
certainty
that
the
princess
had
failed
he
did
not
believe
in
his
own
optimism
true
death
seemed
certain
in
the
tower
but
it
had
been
kept
at
bay
until
now
almost
miraculously
it
seemed
to
him
and
a
faith
in
captain
ellerey
had
grown
up
in
him
the
princess
resolution
to
deliver
herself
to
the
brigands
appeared
little
short
of
madness
to
anton
he
even
considered
whether
he
would
not
be
acting
in
her
best
interests
by
disclosing
the
plan
to
ellerey
and
he
felt
a
traitor
even
when
he
carried
out
her
commands
during
his
long
hours
of
watching
on
the
roof
it
had
been
comparatively
easy
to
communicate
with
the
brigands
on
the
plateau
having
attracted
their
attention
he
dropped
a
paper
wrapped
round
a
piece
of
stone
telling
them
who
the
youth
really
was
that
she
was
ready
to
go
with
them
to
vasilici
on
condition
that
her
companions
were
allowed
to
leave
the
hills
unmolested
that
she
had
in
her
possession
the
token
which
vasilici
expected
and
was
moreover
the
bearer
of
a
message
which
those
who
were
with
her
would
not
allow
her
to
deliver
the
brigands
accepted
the
terms
and
although
they
broke
faith
and
came
back
to
secure
the
two
men
in
the
tower
if
possible
they
made
no
attempt
to
injure
the
princess
when
she
climbed
down
the
rope
after
anton
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
them
she
was
not
wrong
in
thinking
that
she
was
far
too
valuable
a
prisoner
not
to
be
taken
with
all
speed
to
vasilici
as
the
brigands
surrounded
her
anton
caught
the
rope
and
with
a
quick
dexterous
turn
of
his
arm
sent
the
end
of
it
flying
upward
to
the
roof
you
may
trust
us
said
one
man
trying
to
keep
the
anger
out
of
his
voice
i
do
maritza
answered
but
nothing
was
said
about
the
rope
and
a
small
matter
may
make
a
difference
in
such
a
treaty
as
ours
as
they
descended
the
path
maritza
fired
three
times
into
the
air
causing
the
men
near
her
to
start
back
they
are
sleeping
she
said
nodding
toward
the
tower
that
is
to
wake
them
and
let
them
know
of
the
treaty
i
must
ask
you
for
that
weapon
said
the
leader
but
in
spite
of
himself
he
spoke
with
a
certain
deference
it
is
a
dangerous
plaything
in
your
hands
it
is
empty
and
of
no
further
use
to
me
she
answered
with
a
smile
handing
him
the
revolver
keep
it
my
friend
it
has
my
initials
engraved
on
it
and
may
serve
you
as
a
boast
some
day
when
you
entertain
your
fellows
with
tales
of
your
adventures
having
arranged
which
men
should
gradually
fall
out
in
twos
and
threes
and
presently
return
to
the
pass
the
brigands
made
haste
to
march
and
they
did
not
interfere
when
maritza
waved
her
handkerchief
to
the
two
solitary
figures
standing
on
the
plateau
it
would
show
that
the
princess
was
safe
and
allay
any
suspicions
they
might
have
they
would
probably
not
hurry
their
departure
and
were
likely
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
men
returning
to
the
pass
nor
did
they
make
any
objection
to
anton
walking
beside
the
princess
there
was
so
evidently
no
idea
of
attempting
to
escape
how
long
a
march
have
we
before
reaching
vasilici
maritza
asked
turning
to
a
man
who
walked
near
her
we
shall
reach
him
was
the
answer
unless
we
make
a
long
halt
on
the
way
the
man
did
not
look
at
her
as
he
spoke
he
had
been
specially
told
off
to
keep
near
her
and
to
listen
should
she
talk
secretly
with
her
his
companions
immediately
near
straggled
a
little
as
they
marched
and
presently
he
drew
nearer
to
maritza
and
she
noticed
it
take
no
heed
of
me
and
do
not
look
at
me
he
said
have
you
a
hope
of
winning
over
vasilici
i
have
a
message
for
him
a
doubtful
protection
was
the
answer
perhaps
so
but
i
have
friends
in
his
company
you
were
to
make
this
journey
i
have
warned
you
and
still
keeping
his
even
pace
the
man
moved
farther
from
her
side
this
whispered
conversation
set
many
thoughts
surging
through
brain
not
new
thoughts
exactly
for
there
were
few
contingencies
she
had
not
provided
for
when
she
determined
to
place
herself
in
the
hands
of
the
brigands
but
thoughts
which
began
to
cut
deeper
as
it
were
into
a
channel
already
made
this
man
action
proved
that
he
was
not
altogether
indifferent
to
her
and
it
was
hardly
likely
that
he
was
the
only
one
among
vasilici
followers
who
might
be
ready
to
speak
a
word
for
her
perhaps
even
strike
a
blow
for
her
could
she
stir
them
sufficiently
brigandage
was
not
the
natural
calling
of
many
who
had
flocked
to
vasilici
standard
nor
were
they
likely
to
rest
contented
with
vasilici
leadership
for
long
were
they
not
even
now
waiting
for
a
message
from
the
queen
to
whom
in
the
future
they
would
look
for
favor
at
noon
when
a
halt
was
called
this
same
man
saw
that
maritza
had
sufficient
to
eat
and
replaced
the
flask
of
wine
given
her
by
another
saying
that
it
was
better
and
that
she
would
want
all
her
strength
he
took
no
notice
of
anton
who
by
the
princess
instructions
spoke
to
no
one
unless
he
were
spoken
to
she
wanted
to
draw
as
little
attention
to
him
as
possible
and
sought
by
various
means
to
show
that
he
was
a
servant
only
and
not
a
very
highly
valued
one
she
felt
that
his
insignificance
might
render
him
trebly
valuable
under
certain
conditions
so
utterly
absorbed
was
she
by
her
thoughts
that
the
length
of
the
march
did
not
greatly
fatigue
her
she
failed
to
recognize
that
the
way
was
often
rough
and
difficult
and
that
the
pace
of
the
whole
band
had
slackened
somewhat
as
the
day
advanced
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
they
entered
a
narrow
defile
between
two
precipitous
mountain
walls
which
looked
as
though
some
huge
giant
had
cut
out
one
slice
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
perhaps
through
many
ages
a
rapid
narrow
torrent
had
rushed
here
cutting
slowly
but
surely
deeper
there
was
no
water
now
but
the
way
was
paved
with
loose
pebbles
which
made
progress
slow
and
tiring
it
was
not
a
way
one
would
choose
and
since
near
the
entrance
there
were
other
paths
more
inviting
maritza
concluded
that
they
were
nearing
the
end
of
the
journey
for
a
moment
on
entering
the
defile
her
heart
sank
within
her
it
was
like
leaving
the
open
world
and
the
sunlight
to
creep
into
the
dark
unknowable
where
some
horrible
fate
might
await
her
would
she
ever
step
freely
into
the
open
light
of
day
again
her
thoughts
sped
backward
to
the
tower
standing
above
the
pass
and
to
the
man
she
had
left
there
which
road
had
he
taken
the
way
to
sturatzberg
or
the
path
across
the
mountains
northward
which
led
to
safety
if
to
sturatzberg
why
had
he
gone
there
her
hands
clenched
a
little
as
an
answer
came
quickly
to
her
question
but
she
murmured
to
herself
what
is
it
to
me
i
am
maritza
the
lawful
ruler
of
this
land
what
is
anything
to
me
but
the
memory
of
my
fathers
and
the
battle
for
my
rights
the
thought
brought
back
her
courage
and
made
her
calm
they
had
not
proceeded
far
along
the
narrow
defile
before
they
were
challenged
by
a
sentry
posted
upon
a
narrow
pathway
which
seemed
to
have
been
scooped
out
of
the
solid
rock
above
the
rough
road
they
were
traversing
the
challenge
was
a
mere
form
for
he
could
not
fail
to
recognize
many
of
his
companions
but
his
gun
was
not
lowered
until
the
had
been
shouted
back
this
was
evidently
the
stronghold
and
it
was
well
guarded
in
a
retreat
so
defended
by
nature
the
brigands
could
defy
any
army
sent
against
them
and
for
the
first
time
maritza
understood
why
no
effort
had
been
successful
in
dislodging
them
at
the
end
of
the
defile
they
were
challenged
again
this
time
by
a
small
body
of
men
on
guard
there
and
having
answered
and
been
allowed
to
pass
they
emerged
into
a
large
circular
hollow
in
the
hills
on
every
side
it
was
enclosed
by
precipitous
walls
in
which
here
and
there
were
narrow
openings
evidently
paths
similar
to
the
one
they
had
travelled
the
hollow
was
covered
with
tents
and
wooden
huts
the
latter
put
together
with
a
solidity
which
showed
that
they
were
permanent
structures
and
suggested
that
whatever
enterprise
the
brigands
entered
upon
this
stronghold
was
never
left
undefended
the
party
was
evidently
expected
the
news
that
princess
maritza
had
determined
to
place
herself
in
his
hands
had
been
quickly
carried
to
vasilici
and
with
a
few
of
his
leading
men
he
was
seated
in
front
of
a
long
wooden
shed
when
his
captive
was
brought
into
the
hollow
his
arm
was
still
in
a
sling
and
his
expression
was
morose
and
fierce
although
a
grin
of
satisfaction
lightened
his
face
for
a
moment
when
he
saw
the
trim
youthful
figure
and
knew
that
the
cause
of
his
bandaged
arm
was
now
in
his
power
perhaps
in
the
back
of
his
mind
he
had
already
begun
to
devise
fitting
tortures
for
his
enemy
during
the
long
march
maritza
had
pictured
this
moment
and
had
determined
how
to
act
but
the
real
scene
was
rather
different
from
the
picture
she
had
imagined
as
the
men
who
had
brought
her
fell
back
leaving
her
alone
with
anton
a
few
paces
behind
her
she
glanced
round
at
the
crowd
and
said
which
among
you
is
vasilici
his
appearance
sufficiently
marked
him
out
from
his
companions
but
maritza
was
quick
to
perceive
that
there
was
a
smile
on
the
faces
of
some
of
the
men
near
him
when
she
pretended
not
to
recognize
him
perhaps
vasilici
saw
the
smile
too
for
although
his
face
darkened
he
answered
the
question
without
any
sudden
outburst
of
anger
greeting
said
maritza
i
would
be
seated
while
i
talk
the
journey
which
i
have
undertaken
into
these
hills
has
been
a
hurried
one
over
a
rough
road
and
besides
it
is
not
usual
for
a
sovereign
to
stand
in
the
presence
of
her
subjects
vasilici
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
which
found
an
echo
among
many
of
his
followers
but
not
all
even
while
he
laughed
and
before
he
could
say
a
word
to
prevent
it
one
man
had
stepped
forward
and
placed
a
rough
stool
beside
maritza
carry
it
nearer
anton
that
will
do
and
then
she
seated
herself
anton
standing
behind
her
thus
we
can
talk
more
easily
she
said
after
a
pause
are
all
your
leading
men
here
vasilici
all
those
who
form
your
council
for
what
i
have
to
say
concerns
all
in
these
hills
my
will
is
law
was
the
answer
so
long
as
you
please
your
followers
or
the
majority
of
them
i
understand
maritza
said
quickly
absolute
power
lies
in
the
pleasure
or
the
fear
of
the
majority
not
here
said
the
chief
raising
his
voice
angrily
i
alone
am
the
law
then
indeed
are
you
great
among
the
kings
of
the
earth
her
question
had
forced
him
to
exalt
himself
and
this
was
not
pleasing
to
all
those
who
stood
about
him
what
you
have
to
say
say
quickly
vasilici
went
on
the
death
of
good
comrades
lies
at
your
door
and
punishment
is
swift
here
we
move
too
rapidly
to
burden
ourselves
with
prisoners
i
will
be
brief
said
maritza
for
a
long
time
you
have
been
intriguing
with
queen
elena
through
a
servant
of
hers
one
jules
de
froilette
by
him
you
have
been
told
to
expect
a
certain
token
from
her
majesty
upon
the
receipt
of
which
you
were
to
sweep
down
upon
sturatzberg
join
yourselves
with
those
who
espoused
her
cause
in
the
city
and
set
her
alone
upon
the
throne
of
wallaria
that
token
was
brought
to
you
by
captain
ellerey
it
is
a
lie
vasilici
burst
out
and
you
know
it
he
delivered
the
golden
cross
the
sign
of
your
house
if
indeed
you
be
the
princess
maritza
as
you
say
captain
ellerey
brought
the
queen
token
maritza
went
on
quietly
as
though
there
had
been
no
interruption
and
delivered
it
as
he
supposed
he
was
as
astonished
to
see
the
golden
cross
as
you
were
then
you
yes
i
changed
them
there
is
the
proof
and
she
tossed
the
sealed
box
carelessly
into
vasilici
hands
he
cut
it
open
quickly
while
dead
silence
reigned
around
him
and
then
held
up
the
bracelet
of
medallions
that
everyone
might
see
by
this
message
you
accuse
yourself
cried
the
brigand
standing
at
his
full
height
now
hear
your
punishment
wait
said
maritza
there
is
more
to
tell
absolute
as
he
had
proclaimed
himself
to
be
vasilici
nevertheless
glanced
at
those
about
him
and
seeing
that
they
were
inclined
to
hear
all
the
princess
had
to
say
waved
his
hand
for
her
to
continue
the
fact
that
the
chief
was
not
quite
so
strong
as
he
said
was
not
lost
on
maritza
it
is
true
that
i
changed
the
token
she
went
on
not
addressing
herself
especially
to
vasilici
and
if
i
had
a
hope
that
there
might
be
men
loyal
to
me
in
these
hills
for
so
this
miserable
scoundrel
de
froilette
has
told
me
that
was
not
my
only
reason
for
changing
it
de
froilette
never
told
you
that
there
was
a
time
when
he
espoused
my
cause
he
has
never
said
how
he
would
come
fawning
to
me
were
it
in
his
own
interests
to
do
so
he
has
never
explained
what
is
to
follow
your
devotion
to
the
queen
rewards
place
honor
he
has
promised
them
all
yet
on
the
frontier
at
this
moment
lies
a
russian
army
only
waiting
this
de
froilette
word
to
enter
wallaria
and
secure
every
benefit
which
you
have
pledged
yourselves
to
fight
for
the
proof
the
proof
shouted
many
voices
what
proof
can
i
carry
of
such
a
scheme
send
for
de
froilette
on
some
pretext
or
other
and
question
him
or
send
to
the
frontier
and
spy
upon
the
army
that
waits
there
you
have
the
queen
token
i
have
delivered
it
go
out
and
meet
the
king
army
which
lies
ready
to
contest
your
way
to
sturatzberg
if
you
will
but
remember
this
if
you
win
your
way
to
the
city
if
you
succeed
in
overthrowing
the
present
government
and
setting
queen
elena
alone
upon
the
throne
you
will
not
have
advanced
the
cause
of
your
country
one
step
you
will
be
forgotten
as
soon
as
your
work
is
done
and
be
under
the
firm
hand
of
the
muscovite
you
will
have
fought
your
enemies
battle
for
them
and
sold
yourselves
into
slavery
you
will
have
played
into
the
hands
of
this
frenchman
de
froilette
who
is
serving
his
own
ends
only
who
cares
nothing
for
wallaria
whose
reward
lies
ready
for
payment
in
russian
coffers
who
is
as
false
to
queen
elena
and
to
you
as
he
has
been
to
me
there
was
a
low
murmur
among
the
eager
crowd
as
maritza
stopped
abruptly
and
those
sitting
and
standing
near
vasilici
turned
to
one
another
and
whispered
together
whatever
hopes
lay
in
the
hearts
of
these
men
selfish
hopes
for
the
most
part
perhaps
yet
with
some
patriotism
in
them
too
it
was
evident
that
the
accusation
against
de
froilette
was
not
entirely
a
surprise
there
were
men
there
who
had
never
trusted
him
and
maritza
recognized
that
her
words
were
not
without
weight
while
they
still
whispered
and
even
grew
quarrelsome
over
their
opinions
she
rose
from
her
seat
for
a
long
time
i
have
been
in
sturatzberg
watching
events
she
said
raising
her
voice
a
little
and
obtaining
instant
attention
there
are
many
there
who
love
my
cause
some
because
of
my
right
some
because
they
have
learnt
that
wallaria
is
merely
the
plaything
of
the
nations
are
there
not
here
about
me
many
who
love
their
country
who
have
fled
from
tyranny
to
the
freedom
of
these
hills
not
to
defy
just
laws
but
to
withstand
oppression
i
tell
them
that
queen
elena
promises
are
valueless
i
tell
them
that
every
move
the
queen
has
made
is
known
in
sturatzberg
discounted
and
guarded
against
by
the
ministers
of
foreign
powers
who
rule
the
king
i
tell
them
that
the
token
of
the
bracelet
of
medallions
has
no
power
to
help
them
to
freedom
that
from
first
to
last
they
have
been
deceived
i
might
point
to
the
golden
cross
and
tell
them
that
it
is
the
sign
of
this
country
salvation
but
vasilici
who
stands
for
chief
among
you
has
spurned
it
i
might
stand
here
and
cry
to
you
that
he
is
no
chief
worthy
to
lead
an
army
of
patriots
that
there
is
another
now
among
you
whose
right
it
is
to
lead
who
has
the
power
to
win
success
but
men
who
bow
to
windy
words
are
no
countrymen
of
mine
and
i
scorn
to
tempt
them
to
such
false
loyalty
judge
for
yourselves
and
choose
there
stands
vasilici
a
brigand
king
of
these
hills
and
here
stand
i
maritza
princess
daughter
of
wallarian
kings
come
among
you
of
her
own
free
will
i
promise
you
not
success
that
knowledge
is
in
the
mind
of
god
only
but
this
i
do
promise
i
will
lead
you
toward
success
and
if
we
fail
die
fighting
in
the
midst
of
you
choose
therefore
maritza
or
vasilici
the
stroke
was
a
bold
one
brave
men
could
understand
the
daring
of
flinging
down
such
a
challenge
to
a
man
like
vasilici
here
in
his
own
stronghold
it
appealed
in
a
manner
that
nothing
else
she
could
have
done
would
have
appealed
and
she
enhanced
the
force
of
her
words
by
her
apparent
indifference
as
to
what
their
decision
might
be
she
resumed
her
seat
as
abruptly
as
she
had
risen
from
it
and
beckoned
anton
to
approach
her
princess
there
was
reverence
in
his
tone
as
he
bowed
before
her
listen
she
said
quickly
you
marked
well
the
way
we
came
yes
princess
there
is
division
among
them
and
for
the
present
we
are
safe
perhaps
but
the
issue
is
doubtful
if
they
decide
to
hold
me
prisoner
for
a
while
if
their
decision
be
anything
short
of
making
me
their
leader
take
the
first
opportunity
to
escape
back
to
sturatzberg
as
swiftly
as
you
can
and
tell
them
what
has
happened
in
the
hills
wherever
there
is
a
man
who
loves
me
tell
him
the
story
tell
countess
mavrodin
tell
captain
ellerey
if
he
be
in
the
city
give
me
but
a
score
of
men
to
shout
my
cause
and
there
are
many
here
who
will
gladly
add
their
voices
to
such
an
acclamation
tell
them
that
no
shout
not
a
murmur
even
had
followed
maritza
challenge
those
who
hated
her
most
were
astonished
into
silence
vasilici
face
grew
a
shade
more
savage
but
he
was
quick
to
note
that
the
princess
had
not
appealed
altogether
in
vain
he
did
not
turn
to
those
about
him
at
once
and
mock
her
pretensions
it
was
not
the
moment
to
assert
an
authority
which
he
well
knew
some
of
those
with
him
in
the
hills
resented
for
a
time
he
made
no
effort
to
suppress
the
whisperings
on
all
sides
he
had
to
determine
on
some
suddenly
he
turned
toward
maritza
princess
he
said
i
love
a
courageous
foe
all
here
shall
be
your
judges
not
i
i
am
content
she
answered
at
a
sign
from
the
chief
food
and
wine
were
brought
to
her
while
the
brigands
gathered
together
and
listened
eagerly
to
this
counsel
and
to
that
there
were
many
who
like
vasilici
had
taken
to
the
hills
merely
to
swoop
down
upon
the
defenceless
for
pillage
and
for
ransom
who
cared
nothing
who
might
sit
upon
the
throne
in
sturatzberg
and
among
these
there
was
a
certain
resentment
that
latterly
there
had
come
a
change
into
the
councils
that
the
organization
was
in
danger
of
growing
into
a
political
one
what
rewards
in
the
city
could
compensate
for
the
loss
of
their
freedom
in
the
hills
this
faction
was
strong
but
hardly
strong
enough
to
make
it
possible
for
vasilici
to
break
with
his
other
followers
the
chief
knew
it
was
the
time
for
plausible
arguments
rather
than
domineering
demands
and
these
he
well
knew
how
to
use
he
listened
to
the
counsel
of
others
and
he
advised
and
gradually
there
arose
a
large
majority
in
the
camp
to
whose
decision
the
minority
bowed
because
their
opinions
were
subtly
provided
for
there
was
a
smile
upon
vasilici
face
as
he
stood
forward
to
speak
from
which
maritza
argued
no
good
princess
i
am
but
the
mouthpiece
not
the
judge
he
said
it
is
true
that
there
are
many
political
refugees
among
us
to
whom
you
appeal
personally
even
if
your
cause
does
not
but
chiefly
we
are
not
political
we
are
against
all
kings
and
the
laws
which
make
men
either
rich
or
poor
and
we
have
set
up
in
these
hills
a
kingdom
of
our
own
of
which
i
am
at
present
the
head
we
take
our
living
where
we
find
it
such
a
leader
as
you
would
make
should
draw
men
to
your
cause
but
are
they
drawn
is
there
any
real
force
in
sturatzberg
to
rise
and
fight
at
your
bidding
we
doubt
it
we
are
not
patriotic
enough
to
throw
our
lives
away
upon
a
dream
yet
you
may
be
right
and
the
time
may
come
when
the
golden
cross
will
send
us
to
fight
your
battles
but
that
time
is
not
yet
we
want
more
certainty
before
we
espouse
so
desperate
a
venture
those
friends
you
have
in
the
city
yonder
should
however
be
strong
enough
to
insure
your
safety
if
their
loyalty
is
as
you
say
and
for
them
the
time
has
come
to
prove
that
loyalty
for
us
we
have
to
live
it
has
been
decided
therefore
to
hold
you
to
ransom
we
shall
despatch
messengers
to
the
troops
which
lie
in
the
plain
and
for
a
price
we
shall
deliver
you
to
them
i
doubt
not
you
will
receive
as
great
courtesy
from
them
as
from
us
maritza
did
not
answer
you
are
content
princess
said
vasilici
i
am
disappointed
she
returned
i
perceive
that
they
were
only
the
cowards
who
fled
from
sturatzberg
to
these
hills
the
brave
hearts
remain
in
the
city
we
move
said
vasilici
turning
to
those
about
him
let
the
messengers
start
at
once
remember
anton
to
sturatzberg
with
all
the
speed
you
may
now
leave
me
alone
whispered
maritza
to
the
good
offices
of
the
man
who
had
shown
kindness
to
the
princess
anton
owed
his
ability
to
slip
past
the
guards
as
soon
as
night
had
fallen
and
he
had
travelled
a
long
way
when
he
fell
in
with
ellerey
and
baron
petrescu
party
at
dawn
he
told
his
tale
quickly
only
in
sturatzberg
can
we
help
her
anton
declared
it
is
useless
going
forward
she
will
certainly
be
delivered
to
the
soldiers
his
counsel
prevailed
and
they
returned
as
quickly
as
possible
to
the
castle
in
the
hills
taking
the
brigand
who
had
been
their
guide
with
them
they
could
not
let
him
go
and
divulge
their
plans
before
another
dawn
came
they
were
riding
as
swiftly
as
the
rough
way
would
permit
in
the
direction
of
sturatzberg
chapter
xxiii
the
temptation
of
frina
mavrodin
lord
cloverton
pushed
his
chair
back
from
the
table
and
with
his
arms
folded
gazed
abstractedly
at
the
ceiling
captain
ward
sat
opposite
to
him
turning
over
a
pile
of
papers
noting
their
contents
and
placing
them
in
order
de
froilette
was
right
after
all
ward
princess
maritza
has
been
in
sturatzberg
and
will
be
again
almost
immediately
now
that
the
brigands
have
delivered
her
up
she
is
likely
to
be
brought
into
the
city
i
understand
yes
and
lodged
in
the
palace
under
safe
keeping
and
then
then
ward
she
must
bear
the
consequences
of
her
folly
ward
answered
has
england
any
part
to
play
in
whatever
treatment
she
may
receive
no
i
think
not
one
may
pity
the
woman
but
even
a
woman
must
pay
the
penalty
of
her
actions
still
the
death
or
banishment
of
the
princess
may
do
little
to
relieve
the
situation
indeed
may
only
intensify
it
there
have
been
other
influences
at
work
and
we
are
as
ignorant
of
them
as
ever
we
were
i
see
you
have
some
scheme
maturing
my
lord
ward
said
with
a
smile
it
might
mature
at
once
did
i
know
what
had
become
of
captain
ellerey
would
he
seize
the
opportunity
and
escape
out
of
wallaria
think
you
not
if
he
thought
anyone
who
had
a
right
to
his
help
needed
it
he
is
the
kind
of
man
who
would
return
no
matter
what
the
danger
might
be
answered
ward
i
believe
some
friendship
of
the
sort
does
bind
him
to
sturatzberg
said
lord
cloverton
and
i
should
be
happier
if
he
were
in
princess
maritza
company
i
should
know
how
to
act
then
the
door
opened
and
a
servant
brought
in
a
card
ah
now
we
may
hear
news
said
the
ambassador
de
froilette
the
timber
merchant
show
him
in
you
need
not
go
ward
de
froilette
came
in
quickly
and
was
cordially
greeted
by
the
minister
my
secretary
captain
ward
you
may
safely
speak
before
him
monsieur
it
is
no
secret
information
i
have
to
give
said
de
froilette
i
came
rather
impudently
to
give
myself
the
pleasure
of
laughing
at
your
lordship
you
have
seen
fit
to
praise
me
so
often
monsieur
that
i
can
no
doubt
bear
your
ridicule
with
the
same
equanimity
as
i
accepted
your
praise
a
witty
retort
to
my
pleasantry
my
lord
you
did
not
believe
me
when
i
said
princess
maritza
was
in
sturatzberg
you
see
i
was
right
monsieur
i
grant
your
information
was
valuable
my
policy
might
have
suffered
considerably
by
my
disbelief
i
have
learnt
a
lesson
and
wish
to
profit
by
it
can
you
tell
me
where
captain
ellerey
is
no
my
lord
but
i
can
tell
you
where
to
watch
for
him
you
will
help
me
by
doing
so
said
cloverton
in
sturatzberg
my
lord
said
de
froilette
do
you
imagine
he
will
return
to
the
very
centre
of
his
danger
i
am
inclined
to
think
he
has
crossed
the
hills
and
taken
the
quickest
way
out
of
wallaria
you
do
not
know
the
man
and
you
forget
he
is
an
englishman
said
de
froilette
they
are
desperate
fellows
these
english
adventurers
they
have
no
eyes
for
danger
and
are
lacking
that
diplomacy
which
makes
men
feel
that
it
is
honorable
to
retreat
sometimes
he
is
one
of
those
who
love
their
sword
and
would
fain
die
with
their
boots
on
besides
he
is
in
love
ah
now
you
interest
me
monsieur
cloverton
exclaimed
i
have
been
wondering
whether
he
had
not
some
weak
spot
i
heard
him
once
speak
of
princess
maritza
de
froilette
went
on
he
had
met
her
in
england
and
i
read
the
story
behind
his
careless
words
here
in
sturatzberg
the
princess
must
have
seen
him
and
for
love
of
her
he
espoused
her
cause
she
is
being
brought
to
the
city
and
he
will
surely
follow
her
seize
him
my
lord
and
you
nip
the
rebellion
in
the
bud
you
think
so
said
cloverton
reflectively
i
am
certain
of
it
was
the
answer
i
am
even
bold
enough
to
give
advice
the
king
can
afford
to
treat
the
princess
leniently
she
has
no
strong
personality
to
guide
and
counsel
her
alone
she
is
no
danger
or
the
brigands
would
not
have
given
her
up
but
this
mad
englishman
has
the
power
to
keep
her
cause
alive
the
king
can
not
afford
to
pardon
him
kill
him
my
lord
as
quickly
as
you
can
with
her
lover
dead
the
princess
will
have
no
heart
to
plot
i
think
you
are
right
monsieur
i
shall
advise
the
king
and
i
will
do
my
part
in
watching
for
ellerey
said
de
froilette
you
will
be
serving
the
state
monsieur
said
the
ambassador
but
are
there
no
others
who
are
dangerous
the
frenchman
was
thoughtful
for
a
moment
no
i
think
not
he
answered
there
are
some
who
talk
loudly
in
the
back
streets
but
their
talk
serves
them
instead
of
fighting
and
does
no
harm
quite
so
monsieur
but
i
was
not
thinking
of
them
lord
cloverton
returned
there
is
one
curious
feature
in
the
situation
the
brigands
it
is
true
have
played
into
the
hands
of
the
state
but
there
seems
little
doubt
that
they
were
waiting
for
a
message
from
sturatzberg
and
were
prepared
to
act
upon
it
they
did
not
receive
the
message
they
expected
and
so
became
revengeful
now
what
message
did
they
expect
and
from
whom
was
it
to
come
de
froilette
shrugged
his
shoulders
perhaps
captain
ellerey
betrayed
his
trust
and
delivered
the
wrong
message
suggested
the
ambassador
de
froilette
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
by
doing
so
he
may
have
unconsciously
served
the
state
lord
cloverton
continued
and
perhaps
of
course
monsieur
one
has
to
guess
rather
wildly
sometimes
perhaps
balked
the
intentions
of
those
russian
troops
which
for
no
apparent
reason
have
been
gathering
on
the
frontier
then
de
froilette
laughed
you
are
prepared
for
all
emergencies
my
lord
it
is
wonderful
your
foresight
but
i
conceive
that
you
are
making
something
out
of
nothing
the
diplomatic
brain
is
so
fertile
it
surpasses
me
it
is
a
soil
which
so
many
persons
throw
seed
into
monsieur
was
the
answer
those
who
deal
in
timber
are
not
the
only
merchants
who
scent
danger
to
their
interests
in
the
political
ferment
of
the
times
but
your
advice
is
good
i
shall
advise
the
king
when
captain
ellerey
comes
he
may
tell
us
more
and
the
ambassador
rose
putting
an
end
to
the
interview
when
the
door
had
closed
upon
the
frenchman
he
resumed
his
seat
and
smiled
benignantly
the
smile
invited
comment
from
his
companion
personal
enmity
as
regards
ellerey
said
ward
and
astonishment
at
your
accurate
knowledge
the
ambassador
nodded
he
should
be
watched
said
ward
that
is
no
longer
necessary
was
the
quick
answer
whatever
power
he
may
have
had
is
gone
he
is
chiefly
concerned
about
his
own
skin
nowadays
and
it
would
not
surprise
me
to
hear
that
business
had
suddenly
called
him
away
from
sturatzberg
still
i
thank
him
for
giving
me
an
idea
i
shall
see
the
king
de
froilette
went
quickly
back
to
the
altstrasse
and
it
would
appear
that
captain
ward
estimate
of
his
attitude
was
near
the
truth
he
sent
for
francois
at
once
the
net
is
being
drawn
in
francois
he
said
are
we
within
it
we
shall
easily
escape
was
the
answer
is
everything
ready
to
depart
at
a
moment
notice
yes
monsieur
good
you
carry
a
revolver
francois
the
man
showed
it
to
him
good
again
captain
ellerey
will
return
to
sturatzberg
may
have
done
so
already
that
he
has
played
us
false
we
know
that
he
can
give
evidence
against
us
is
certain
revenge
and
safety
therefore
lie
in
the
same
direction
watch
for
him
francois
as
i
shall
and
silence
him
and
his
servant
asked
the
man
if
your
private
quarrel
with
the
servant
leads
you
to
do
so
no
harm
will
be
done
and
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
he
dismissed
him
the
news
that
princess
maritza
was
in
the
hands
of
the
king
troops
and
was
being
brought
to
sturatzberg
had
reached
the
city
early
that
morning
but
the
news
was
not
immediately
known
to
frina
mavrodin
it
was
being
conveyed
to
her
by
a
trusted
messenger
who
had
much
to
do
on
his
way
and
the
fact
that
she
had
lately
kept
much
at
home
accounted
for
her
not
hearing
it
from
any
other
source
the
days
of
waiting
are
ever
the
longest
days
to
live
through
and
the
hours
had
dragged
heavily
for
frina
mavrodin
since
baron
petrescu
had
started
for
the
hills
hardly
anyone
saw
her
except
hannah
and
the
old
serving
woman
pitied
her
judging
her
distress
by
her
own
she
little
knew
the
terrible
struggle
which
raged
in
the
breast
of
this
beautiful
woman
how
all
that
was
good
and
bad
in
her
all
those
latent
forces
which
lie
in
the
heart
of
everyone
sprang
into
life
and
fought
equally
for
the
mastery
it
was
not
the
princess
who
was
first
in
her
thoughts
from
dawn
to
dark
or
whose
image
passed
incessantly
through
her
restless
dreams
it
was
the
man
who
was
beside
the
princess
who
had
fought
desperately
for
her
whether
he
loved
her
cause
or
not
who
was
hourly
under
the
spell
of
her
enchantment
the
potency
of
that
spell
seemed
to
grow
the
more
she
thought
of
it
and
all
the
charm
which
some
had
professed
to
find
in
herself
seemed
to
sink
into
insignificance
it
was
not
sufficient
to
win
the
love
of
this
man
and
those
waiting
hours
too
are
hours
of
danger
troubles
or
desires
or
whatever
thoughts
assail
at
such
a
time
lose
their
proportion
and
idleness
lends
vitality
to
the
evil
lying
dormant
was
there
no
way
to
win
her
desire
between
it
and
her
stood
only
the
princess
an
enemy
to
the
state
might
she
not
be
swept
out
of
the
way
how
easy
such
a
thing
seemed
to
be
she
had
only
to
speak
a
few
words
to
dash
to
the
ground
all
maritza
hopes
of
success
why
not
speak
them
in
love
and
war
all
means
are
fair
and
then
arose
the
good
in
her
and
she
turned
away
in
horror
from
the
very
thought
of
such
treachery
it
was
in
a
fierce
moment
of
her
struggle
that
the
messenger
arrived
dumitru
yet
unweary
more
keenly
alive
now
perhaps
than
he
had
even
been
as
anton
in
the
hills
came
to
her
what
news
what
news
she
cried
springing
up
the
worst
countess
dead
no
the
princess
lives
yes
yes
and
those
who
are
with
her
are
on
their
way
to
the
city
dumitru
answered
we
could
not
enter
openly
we
had
to
delay
and
exercise
the
greatest
care
baron
petrescu
will
come
if
possible
but
extreme
caution
is
needed
i
came
on
i
am
of
no
importance
and
pass
unnoticed
i
have
visited
a
score
of
places
in
the
city
already
and
i
have
much
more
to
do
before
sunset
does
captain
ellerey
return
to
sturatzberg
asked
frina
thoughtfully
aye
and
he
is
a
man
whose
equal
these
eyes
are
never
likely
to
see
again
he
is
fit
to
be
a
king
a
king
yes
a
king
and
though
he
be
a
foreigner
i
for
one
shout
for
him
a
king
dumitru
tell
me
does
he
love
the
princess
surely
he
must
since
for
her
cause
he
has
shown
no
great
affection
he
will
be
here
to
strike
one
more
good
blow
for
her
and
loving
her
may
learn
to
love
her
cause
too
we
may
yet
triumph
countess
but
listen
the
princess
has
been
delivered
by
the
brigands
and
dumitru
told
her
the
whole
story
quickly
she
will
be
brought
back
to
sturatzberg
he
went
on
although
it
is
given
out
that
she
will
not
come
until
the
morning
the
gates
will
be
shut
and
when
the
streets
are
quiet
they
will
be
opened
again
not
many
soldiers
are
with
her
and
those
within
the
gates
will
hold
all
danger
cheap
the
city
will
be
hushed
and
still
but
there
are
many
who
will
not
sleep
a
signal
will
blaze
forth
in
the
darkness
and
a
few
may
fall
in
the
streets
but
the
princess
will
be
free
you
will
be
ready
to
receive
her
countess
here
is
it
not
the
safest
refuge
in
sturatzberg
asked
dumitru
there
are
here
and
you
are
not
a
suspect
in
the
city
and
afterward
said
the
countess
i
know
not
a
small
success
in
the
city
would
perhaps
raise
the
country
the
afterward
is
for
the
princess
to
decide
she
will
have
to
consider
the
welfare
of
those
who
strike
you
will
be
ready
to
receive
her
countess
yes
frina
answered
and
dumitru
went
to
pursue
his
way
through
the
city
calling
men
to
arm
and
prepare
little
dreaming
what
thoughts
troubled
the
beautiful
woman
he
had
left
the
frail
little
hopes
she
had
found
consolation
in
vanished
at
dumitru
words
desmond
ellerey
loved
maritza
dumitru
had
said
it
and
had
he
not
had
ample
opportunity
of
judging
now
maritza
was
to
come
a
fugitive
to
her
house
her
very
life
perhaps
lay
in
her
hands
how
easy
it
would
be
to
speak
the
few
words
which
would
tell
her
enemies
where
she
was
hidden
and
who
would
know
who
would
guess
that
it
was
the
countess
mavrodin
who
had
betrayed
her
such
specious
arguments
did
the
evil
that
was
in
her
whisper
in
her
ear
and
she
could
not
shut
the
whisperings
out
all
day
long
her
restlessness
increased
her
solitude
became
unbearable
she
longed
for
the
world
of
men
and
women
hungered
to
hear
laughter
and
the
sound
of
voices
anything
to
distract
her
from
her
thoughts
that
evening
she
went
to
court
beautiful
reckless
heartless
to
all
seeming
ready
to
be
flattered
and
to
flatter
a
dangerous
mood
for
such
a
woman
to
be
in
so
all
unconsciously
she
was
driven
forward
by
destiny
she
was
in
a
mood
to
be
tempted
and
the
greatest
temptation
of
all
was
lying
in
wait
for
her
she
had
shown
such
marked
preference
for
captain
ellerey
when
he
came
to
court
that
a
host
of
her
admirers
had
perforce
to
stand
sullenly
aside
they
gathered
round
her
each
one
in
his
turn
receiving
some
little
favor
which
buried
in
oblivion
all
past
disappointments
such
virtue
lies
even
in
the
least
of
a
beautiful
woman
favors
frina
mavrodin
had
always
had
the
subtle
power
of
making
her
companion
of
the
moment
believe
that
he
was
the
one
person
in
all
the
world
she
would
wish
to
have
beside
her
and
this
power
she
exercised
to
the
full
lord
cloverton
covertly
watching
her
was
constrained
to
admire
her
and
even
his
old
blood
tingled
with
a
remembrance
of
youth
as
he
did
so
but
he
did
not
approach
her
it
was
not
his
part
to
play
the
tempter
he
had
arranged
otherwise
presently
he
saw
the
king
enter
the
room
alone
and
look
round
in
search
of
some
one
his
eye
fell
upon
frina
mavrodin
and
he
went
toward
her
perhaps
too
in
his
veins
the
blood
tingled
a
little
an
hour
of
ease
which
so
seldom
falls
to
me
renews
my
strength
countess
and
youth
and
beauty
draw
me
like
a
lodestone
said
the
king
your
majesty
is
pleased
to
flatter
me
she
answered
with
a
sweeping
curtsey
that
would
indeed
be
impossible
i
am
honored
doubly
so
if
you
will
take
my
hand
in
the
dance
it
was
a
set
dance
stately
in
its
measure
and
those
who
watched
remarked
how
the
grace
of
the
woman
seemed
to
lend
grace
to
the
movements
who
danced
but
seldom
and
that
in
truth
somewhat
awkwardly
the
king
thanked
her
as
he
led
her
to
a
seat
when
the
dance
was
over
it
was
in
the
alcove
where
she
had
so
often
sat
with
ellerey
and
the
coincidence
impressed
her
there
should
be
brighter
times
at
hand
for
wallaria
countess
said
the
king
the
princess
maritza
will
enter
sturatzberg
a
prisoner
so
i
have
heard
your
majesty
and
you
loyally
rejoice
with
us
countess
the
question
was
so
marked
in
the
intonation
of
the
king
voice
that
frina
mavrodin
was
on
her
guard
in
a
moment
she
is
a
woman
your
majesty
and
since
i
am
no
politician
i
pity
the
woman
i
am
not
without
pity
either
countess
was
the
answer
the
princess
has
been
and
the
onus
lies
with
those
who
have
advised
and
supported
her
it
is
upon
them
punishment
should
rightly
fall
and
who
are
they
asked
the
countess
that
is
a
question
to
which
there
is
no
complete
answer
said
the
king
there
is
only
one
i
can
name
definitely
but
there
is
one
person
in
sturatzberg
who
could
answer
the
question
so
i
am
informed
and
so
i
believe
and
he
will
not
answer
she
has
not
yet
been
asked
the
king
returned
a
woman
your
majesty
a
very
beautiful
woman
yourself
countess
perhaps
frina
mavrodin
was
prepared
for
the
king
words
she
did
not
start
the
color
did
not
rise
to
her
cheeks
she
remained
silent
for
a
few
moments
feeling
that
the
king
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
i
can
guess
who
was
your
majesty
informant
she
said
quietly
lord
cloverton
he
has
always
credited
me
with
a
power
i
do
not
possess
and
has
often
set
traps
for
me
they
were
subtly
hidden
well
devised
to
catch
a
schemer
but
being
innocent
they
failed
to
ensnare
me
we
ourselves
have
eyes
countess
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
british
ambassador
should
see
for
us
no
your
majesty
but
we
the
court
sometimes
fancy
that
he
attempts
to
take
that
duty
upon
himself
frina
answered
then
you
will
not
help
me
countess
said
the
king
with
a
smile
in
any
way
i
can
your
majesty
but
not
in
the
way
i
want
it
is
a
pity
you
will
force
me
to
harsh
measures
there
is
one
other
i
may
constrain
to
tell
me
unless
he
values
his
secret
more
than
life
frina
looked
at
him
a
question
in
her
eyes
but
her
lips
gave
it
no
words
a
brave
man
said
the
king
although
circumstances
have
made
him
my
enemy
you
might
save
him
still
frina
was
silent
probably
captain
ellerey
will
not
speak
therefore
it
is
certain
that
captain
ellerey
must
die
said
the
king
slowly
is
he
in
sturatzberg
ah
countess
you
must
not
try
and
surprise
my
secrets
but
rest
assured
he
must
die
unless
you
choose
to
save
him
how
can
i
save
him
she
asked
the
king
suddenly
laid
his
hand
on
hers
which
were
folded
in
her
lap
early
send
me
by
a
trusted
messenger
the
names
of
those
who
are
foremost
in
maritza
cause
the
names
of
the
societies
whose
plans
and
aims
they
govern
and
so
far
as
is
in
your
knowledge
the
plans
which
they
have
formed
on
my
royal
oath
none
shall
know
from
whom
i
received
this
information
and
captain
ellerey
shall
be
free
to
leave
wallaria
he
is
a
brave
man
and
i
would
help
him
if
i
could
she
said
you
can
countess
if
you
love
him
you
will
your
majesty
is
strangely
at
fault
captain
ellerey
is
nothing
to
me
i
have
touched
your
hand
countess
as
you
asked
a
question
concerning
him
and
felt
the
quiver
in
your
frame
your
heart
would
not
answer
as
your
lips
do
remember
this
he
dies
unless
you
save
him
but
i
am
powerless
your
majesty
then
countess
his
case
is
hard
indeed
there
are
some
hours
before
use
them
to
understand
how
powerful
you
are
in
this
matter
so
far
i
will
obey
your
majesty
always
remembering
countess
that
if
you
can
not
save
him
no
power
on
earth
can
and
with
a
bow
the
king
left
her
alone
here
was
the
opportunity
she
had
dreamed
of
no
one
would
ever
know
what
to
her
were
princess
maritza
and
all
her
followers
in
comparison
with
desmond
ellerey
there
was
a
look
of
determination
in
her
face
as
she
left
the
alcove
quickly
the
few
hours
before
tomorrow
seemed
all
too
short
for
her
chapter
xxiv
how
maritza
entered
sturatzberg
it
was
a
dark
night
without
a
moon
and
only
a
faint
star
or
two
glimmered
in
the
sky
the
smell
of
rain
was
in
the
air
and
there
was
a
closeness
in
the
atmosphere
which
made
the
effort
of
breathing
a
conscious
one
it
was
still
early
as
frina
mavrodin
was
driven
rapidly
homeward
she
left
the
palace
immediately
after
her
conversation
with
the
king
the
few
hours
before
were
best
spent
alone
a
wild
confusion
of
thoughts
surged
through
her
brain
but
one
thought
was
ever
dominant
how
could
she
save
desmond
ellerey
without
betraying
others
for
while
the
king
suggestion
was
a
subtle
and
potent
temptation
it
had
the
effect
of
steadying
the
countess
such
an
idea
as
a
wholesale
betrayal
of
those
who
had
trusted
her
had
never
occurred
to
her
her
only
thought
had
been
how
to
raise
a
barrier
between
maritza
and
desmond
ellerey
how
to
act
so
that
they
might
be
effectually
separated
forever
such
plans
as
had
come
into
her
mind
may
have
been
mean
and
unworthy
but
the
circumstances
had
excused
them
the
words
had
robbed
them
of
all
excuse
had
shown
her
that
base
treachery
belonged
to
them
as
surely
as
to
the
larger
scheme
which
he
had
suggested
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
blame
him
for
the
suggestion
politically
perhaps
he
was
justified
but
that
he
could
believe
her
capable
of
such
treachery
showed
her
that
between
her
private
jealousy
and
her
political
position
there
was
no
room
to
draw
even
the
finest
of
lines
so
the
few
hours
before
were
not
to
be
used
as
the
king
supposed
in
a
struggle
between
her
honor
and
her
desire
but
in
concentrated
thought
of
how
his
majesty
might
be
outwitted
desmond
ellerey
must
be
saved
but
neither
the
princess
nor
her
followers
must
be
sacrificed
to
save
him
her
own
desire
must
stand
aside
whatever
the
suffering
might
be
thus
through
the
fierce
fire
of
temptation
frina
mavrodin
came
forth
a
stronger
woman
a
keener
slave
to
duty
because
that
duty
must
cost
her
so
much
and
having
shaken
herself
free
from
the
fetters
of
selfishness
her
thoughts
and
conceptions
became
more
acute
it
was
hardly
possible
that
desmond
ellerey
had
yet
returned
to
sturatzberg
no
one
could
know
his
movements
better
than
dumitru
and
he
had
shown
no
fear
concerning
him
even
if
the
king
possessed
information
which
might
point
to
the
probability
of
his
arrest
ellerey
courage
and
resourcefulness
were
factors
to
be
reckoned
with
before
his
arrest
could
become
an
accomplished
fact
that
in
defence
he
might
prove
reckless
was
true
but
he
would
hardly
do
so
until
every
other
means
had
failed
no
the
king
had
played
upon
her
fears
and
she
had
fallen
a
victim
to
his
cunning
she
had
plainly
shown
that
ellerey
was
dear
to
her
that
she
was
prepared
to
sacrifice
much
to
secure
his
safety
she
had
moreover
given
the
impression
that
she
could
betray
many
in
sturatzberg
if
she
would
and
therefore
should
the
rescue
of
maritza
prove
successful
she
herself
and
her
house
and
all
who
belonged
to
her
would
be
closely
watched
she
had
in
fact
undone
what
she
had
so
persistently
taken
pains
to
accomplish
she
had
given
cause
for
suspicion
she
had
rendered
her
house
by
the
river
an
unsafe
place
of
refuge
how
was
she
to
retrieve
the
position
entering
her
house
she
gave
rapid
instructions
to
certain
of
her
servants
and
then
went
to
her
own
rooms
and
sent
for
hannah
the
old
serving
woman
came
quickly
and
to
her
frina
made
her
first
confession
i
have
been
cross
hannah
sometimes
she
said
forgive
me
oh
no
my
lady
you
have
only
been
troubled
we
all
have
our
own
way
of
showing
grief
true
hannah
and
i
have
had
troubles
which
you
can
not
know
of
your
quick
pardon
teaches
me
a
lesson
o
my
lady
listen
hannah
there
is
much
to
do
and
little
time
to
do
it
in
perhaps
the
princess
will
return
here
hannah
exclaimed
yes
but
she
will
be
a
fugitive
from
her
enemies
and
how
long
this
house
may
be
a
safe
refuge
for
her
i
can
not
tell
come
with
me
i
will
show
you
a
means
of
escape
should
the
worst
happen
a
stout
door
which
will
hold
back
pursuers
for
a
long
time
it
opens
from
a
room
which
shall
be
yours
for
the
time
the
key
shall
be
in
your
possession
study
to
look
innocent
hannah
when
you
are
questioned
and
in
a
crucial
moment
you
may
prove
a
far
better
defence
than
a
dozen
armed
men
come
as
frina
mavrodin
had
driven
through
the
city
there
were
many
people
in
the
streets
the
cafes
were
still
full
and
there
were
no
signs
of
any
unusual
excitement
a
few
may
have
discussed
princess
maritza
over
their
coffee
liquor
or
syrup
but
in
most
cases
it
was
with
casual
interest
or
with
a
remark
that
if
they
were
abroad
early
enough
they
might
walk
down
to
the
southern
gate
to
see
her
enter
what
had
her
fate
to
do
with
them
though
the
times
were
troublous
they
would
go
their
way
as
they
had
done
as
they
would
every
day
until
their
own
small
circle
of
interest
were
touched
they
had
as
little
sympathy
with
the
agitator
as
they
had
with
the
government
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
did
anything
to
affect
them
materially
so
these
citizens
only
because
there
was
no
temptation
to
be
otherwise
perhaps
finished
their
coffee
and
went
home
and
the
streets
of
sturatzberg
grew
quieter
and
with
the
closing
of
the
cafes
darker
the
city
gates
were
shut
and
if
a
few
soldiers
appeared
at
the
corners
of
streets
they
caused
little
interest
to
the
people
going
home
since
the
murdered
bodies
had
been
found
lying
in
the
bergenstrasse
it
was
only
right
that
the
city
should
be
well
guarded
the
soldiers
themselves
grumbled
somewhat
fighting
was
their
trade
and
they
were
discontented
at
being
made
a
city
watch
beyond
a
late
reveller
or
two
no
one
was
out
after
midnight
what
was
the
use
of
all
this
precaution
in
the
smaller
streets
there
was
even
greater
silence
where
one
might
have
expected
to
find
whatever
dissatisfaction
existed
in
the
city
there
was
only
the
greater
peace
hardly
a
light
shone
out
from
any
of
the
dark
buildings
no
one
lurked
in
shadowy
corners
and
although
the
soldiers
had
been
ordered
to
be
especially
careful
tonight
there
seemed
to
be
even
less
than
usual
to
demand
their
attention
they
believed
that
the
princess
maritza
was
to
enter
the
city
at
dawn
at
the
of
the
southern
gate
the
men
were
alert
an
hour
ago
their
officer
had
told
them
what
was
to
happen
and
the
news
was
presently
conveyed
to
the
soldiers
at
the
corners
the
officer
of
the
guardroom
kept
a
steady
watch
upon
the
slowly
passing
minutes
while
outside
the
city
a
small
army
had
approached
under
cover
of
the
darkness
without
and
within
there
was
silence
yet
wakeful
and
watching
men
may
be
as
silent
as
those
who
sleep
throughout
the
day
a
man
had
passed
from
one
narrow
street
to
another
with
quick
and
stealthy
steps
into
this
house
he
went
mounting
the
stairs
swiftly
and
disappeared
for
a
few
moments
into
some
upper
room
then
as
swiftly
he
came
down
again
and
gliding
up
alleys
and
streets
entered
one
little
cafe
after
another
and
mounted
to
many
a
room
whose
occupants
listened
eagerly
to
his
words
and
made
a
sign
that
they
were
understood
long
before
darkness
had
fallen
upon
sturatzberg
there
were
many
cafes
doing
little
business
to
all
seeming
which
nevertheless
were
crowded
with
men
hidden
away
and
waiting
such
a
crowd
waited
in
the
long
room
at
the
rear
of
the
toison
the
men
who
composed
it
had
gathered
there
one
by
one
as
they
had
done
that
night
when
they
came
to
drink
with
the
soldiers
who
had
been
found
dead
in
the
bergenstrasse
next
morning
many
of
the
same
men
were
in
the
crowd
many
also
of
those
who
had
once
chased
ellerey
so
furiously
through
the
garden
of
that
other
tavern
where
was
the
door
in
the
wall
they
greeted
each
new
arrival
with
a
nod
and
for
the
most
part
were
silent
or
spoke
only
in
whispers
at
what
hour
asked
one
two
hours
after
midnight
are
our
numbers
sufficient
quite
sufficient
answered
another
at
a
dozen
places
i
have
had
our
brothers
gathered
close
to
the
spot
from
which
they
will
make
their
rush
upon
the
troops
the
attack
will
come
from
all
sides
at
once
and
the
soldiers
will
be
taken
by
surprise
we
can
not
fail
does
the
princess
know
dumitru
not
certainly
but
she
will
be
expectant
and
ready
you
understand
whose
command
you
have
to
obey
and
the
signal
the
men
about
him
nodded
and
smiled
with
quiet
confidence
while
dumitru
passed
on
to
others
to
answer
similar
questions
he
was
of
much
importance
among
them
they
felt
that
he
was
but
the
mouthpiece
of
the
princess
that
she
was
their
real
leader
that
the
time
they
had
waited
for
and
plotted
toward
had
really
come
a
few
nervous
ones
there
were
among
them
who
calculated
what
the
price
of
failure
would
be
and
had
planned
what
they
might
do
for
their
own
safety
in
such
an
event
but
the
majority
of
them
were
enthusiasts
who
rejoiced
that
the
hour
of
action
had
arrived
at
last
after
dumitru
there
will
be
no
turning
back
whispered
one
man
who
standing
on
a
chair
had
called
for
the
toast
to
maritza
on
that
night
fatal
to
the
deserting
soldiers
the
next
few
days
will
make
the
name
of
sturatzberg
ring
through
the
world
and
our
deeds
strike
terror
into
the
heart
of
the
nation
dumitru
nodded
and
passed
on
but
he
too
kept
eager
watch
upon
the
time
even
as
did
the
officer
at
the
guardhouse
the
crowd
became
more
excited
and
restless
as
the
hands
of
the
clock
crept
farther
and
farther
from
midnight
surely
it
is
time
now
they
whispered
at
intervals
and
the
leaders
had
some
difficulty
in
restraining
them
as
it
was
in
the
toison
so
it
was
in
many
a
dark
house
where
men
lay
hidden
and
waiting
from
the
watchman
over
the
gate
word
was
sent
to
the
officer
that
the
prisoner
had
come
and
at
his
command
the
gates
silently
swung
back
upon
their
hinges
it
was
a
large
body
of
men
that
entered
having
in
their
midst
a
slim
boyish
figure
mounted
on
a
charger
so
maritza
entered
sturatzberg
the
men
at
the
word
of
command
halted
to
right
and
left
and
only
a
few
comparatively
continued
their
silent
march
along
the
bergenstrasse
with
the
city
full
of
troops
what
chance
of
escape
had
that
lonely
prisoner
who
spoke
no
word
yet
furtively
glanced
to
this
side
and
that
and
studied
the
attitude
of
the
men
nearest
to
her
she
noted
that
soldiers
stood
at
attention
at
street
corners
a
few
here
a
few
there
that
of
all
other
signs
of
life
the
streets
were
empty
she
realized
that
she
had
been
brought
in
at
an
unexpected
hour
and
the
silence
over
the
city
fell
upon
her
soul
hopelessness
and
despair
seized
her
and
a
wild
thought
prompted
her
to
make
a
sudden
dash
for
freedom
death
might
come
but
such
a
death
was
preferable
to
the
fate
which
must
await
her
at
the
end
of
this
journey
her
fingers
had
tightened
on
the
reins
when
the
silence
was
suddenly
broken
and
with
a
swift
hiss
a
streak
of
light
cut
through
the
darkness
skyward
paused
a
moment
and
then
with
a
muffled
detonation
burst
into
globes
of
light
which
floated
downward
the
foremost
of
the
troop
reined
in
their
horses
sharply
at
the
unexpected
flight
of
the
rocket
causing
some
confusion
among
those
behind
then
came
a
quick
command
from
an
officer
which
was
half
lost
in
the
great
shout
which
rent
the
air
on
every
side
for
grigosie
grigosie
had
the
cry
been
for
maritza
the
soldiers
might
possibly
have
understood
better
what
this
sudden
stopping
of
their
progress
meant
but
as
it
was
a
black
rushing
mass
was
upon
them
before
they
had
time
to
draw
their
weapons
the
attack
was
so
fierce
so
sudden
and
overwhelming
that
when
the
meaning
of
it
had
thoroughly
dawned
upon
the
soldiers
they
had
enough
to
do
to
protect
themselves
without
giving
much
thought
to
their
prisoner
there
was
hardly
a
trooper
who
was
not
in
a
moment
separated
from
his
fellows
by
a
swaying
mob
whose
one
object
seemed
to
be
to
force
the
soldiers
apart
and
prevent
any
concerted
action
the
ring
of
steel
and
the
crack
of
revolvers
mingled
with
groans
and
curses
and
sharp
cries
which
blades
thrust
home
drew
forth
here
a
horse
fell
prostrate
on
its
knees
bringing
its
rider
head
foremost
into
the
arms
of
his
assailants
and
there
some
plunging
charger
dexterously
managed
beat
down
and
trampled
on
a
writhing
mass
of
limbs
shouting
came
from
a
distance
as
the
soldiers
from
the
various
street
corners
came
running
into
the
bergenstrasse
to
the
assistance
of
their
comrades
and
since
they
ran
compactly
and
with
bayonets
fixed
the
mob
gave
way
before
them
an
officer
whose
plunging
horse
cleared
a
path
before
him
slashed
right
and
left
as
he
came
and
shouted
to
the
prisoner
secure
the
prisoner
and
desperately
he
struggled
toward
the
slim
figure
carried
this
way
and
that
by
the
swaying
fighting
crowd
at
his
shout
the
crowd
threw
itself
more
savagely
upon
him
the
greatest
danger
seemed
to
centre
in
this
man
and
bullets
sang
about
him
and
steel
struck
at
him
from
every
side
quickly
princess
a
strong
arm
was
about
her
and
drew
her
swiftly
from
her
horse
in
a
moment
a
ring
of
men
had
formed
about
her
as
they
pushed
their
way
through
the
crowd
two
soldiers
who
sought
to
stop
them
fell
back
groaning
and
were
trampled
under
foot
and
then
the
little
band
with
the
slim
figure
in
the
midst
of
it
was
outside
the
mob
and
at
the
entrance
to
a
narrow
dark
street
hold
this
street
with
your
lives
cried
one
this
way
princess
and
with
half
a
dozen
men
to
guide
and
guard
her
she
ran
forward
the
din
of
the
struggle
in
the
bergenstrasse
growing
fainter
and
fainter
as
they
went
another
rocket
hissed
skyward
and
then
tactics
changed
the
crowd
knew
what
the
signal
meant
and
instead
of
throwing
themselves
fiercely
on
the
soldiers
they
began
to
draw
back
to
side
streets
fighting
desperately
at
corners
for
a
few
moments
and
then
fleeing
breaking
up
into
small
knots
and
turning
by
twos
and
threes
into
alleys
and
dark
passages
into
which
the
soldiers
did
not
deem
it
wise
to
follow
them
fully
an
hour
passed
before
the
bergenstrasse
was
cleared
and
many
a
dark
form
lay
stretched
in
the
roadway
and
not
a
few
who
wore
the
king
uniform
some
lay
quite
still
their
troubles
and
ambitions
over
some
attempted
to
crawl
away
and
hide
themselves
while
others
too
hurt
to
move
groaned
and
cried
piteously
for
help
the
inhabitants
of
the
bergenstrasse
had
been
rudely
awakened
but
for
a
long
time
none
ventured
out
to
render
any
help
to
the
wounded
lest
the
soldiers
should
attack
them
meanwhile
running
feet
woke
the
echoes
of
the
quieter
streets
and
distant
parts
of
the
town
men
speeding
toward
safety
more
troops
would
march
from
the
castle
presently
and
it
would
be
dangerous
to
be
found
in
the
streets
doors
in
dark
streets
opened
and
quietly
closed
again
weapons
were
carefully
hidden
away
under
loose
boards
and
their
owners
became
harmless
citizens
again
one
little
band
of
men
held
together
running
lightly
and
certain
of
every
corner
they
turned
some
of
them
were
those
who
had
guided
the
princess
to
safety
and
now
they
were
bent
on
carrying
the
good
news
to
others
who
were
waiting
eagerly
to
hear
it
the
foremost
stopped
at
a
door
and
gave
a
peculiar
knock
it
was
opened
immediately
and
the
custodian
asked
no
questions
as
the
men
filed
in
and
went
quickly
to
the
rooms
looking
on
to
the
garden
where
not
so
long
ago
they
had
helped
to
put
an
end
to
a
duel
as
they
entered
the
long
room
which
was
only
dimly
lighted
they
paused
it
was
easy
to
see
that
there
was
consternation
among
the
men
gathered
there
and
strangers
were
present
well
cried
a
dozen
voices
she
is
safe
safe
gone
to
her
death
and
destruction
was
the
answer
the
countess
is
a
traitor
it
death
to
the
first
man
who
repeats
that
accusation
thundered
one
of
the
strangers
his
hand
upon
his
sword
hilt
and
as
the
men
drew
back
before
such
sudden
fury
they
noticed
that
the
other
stranger
a
bearded
soldier
of
huge
proportions
grasped
his
sword
hilt
too
the
men
who
had
run
from
the
bergenstrasse
waited
for
an
explanation
are
we
not
all
friends
here
exclaimed
baron
petrescu
hastily
there
is
some
mistake
tell
us
your
story
again
and
he
turned
to
a
man
who
had
only
ceased
speaking
as
the
newcomers
had
entered
he
had
come
in
breathless
haste
at
the
very
moment
that
petrescu
had
brought
desmond
ellerey
and
stefan
through
the
garden
willing
hands
had
opened
the
low
door
in
the
wall
for
them
forewarned
of
their
coming
by
dumitru
ellerey
fame
had
run
before
him
and
eagerly
was
he
looked
for
and
recognized
as
the
leader
of
the
rebellion
which
must
quickly
follow
the
work
going
forward
in
the
city
he
had
come
the
conspirators
had
succeeded
in
rescuing
princess
maritza
and
now
came
this
man
with
a
tale
which
filled
their
hearts
with
consternation
i
had
it
from
one
who
fills
a
chief
servant
place
in
the
palace
and
who
is
one
of
us
said
the
man
speaking
rapidly
he
was
delayed
in
coming
to
me
or
i
should
have
been
here
earlier
the
king
sought
out
the
countess
danced
with
her
and
then
seated
in
an
alcove
behind
some
curtains
of
which
this
man
was
hidden
the
king
persuaded
her
to
betray
those
who
favored
the
cause
of
the
princess
and
the
countess
was
tempted
and
promised
early
she
is
to
send
the
information
to
the
king
by
a
trusted
messenger
and
the
king
has
given
his
oath
that
no
one
shall
know
from
whom
it
comes
i
do
not
believe
it
said
the
baron
she
may
have
promised
but
she
had
some
reason
for
doing
so
she
had
baron
the
king
persuaded
her
that
her
act
of
betrayal
should
be
the
salvation
of
a
rebel
what
rebel
princess
maritza
asked
petrescu
no
baron
captain
ellerey
it
was
indeed
a
subtle
temptation
and
petrescu
turned
slowly
to
look
at
his
companion
the
truth
shall
quickly
be
put
to
the
test
said
ellerey
give
me
wine
a
full
measure
to
put
new
strength
in
me
is
mine
to
be
the
only
voice
raised
in
her
defence
are
you
all
so
ready
to
believe
evil
of
the
woman
who
has
served
your
princess
so
well
i
stake
my
honor
that
with
her
maritza
is
safe
true
but
speak
less
harshly
captain
whispered
petrescu
these
men
are
our
friends
do
not
anger
them
he
from
whom
i
had
the
news
ever
speaks
the
truth
said
the
man
who
had
told
the
story
he
has
never
failed
us
in
the
past
has
the
countess
ever
failed
you
in
the
past
ellerey
cried
shame
on
you
all
for
the
thought
her
loyalty
shall
be
proved
on
the
instant
you
can
do
nothing
said
petrescu
soldiers
are
in
every
street
said
a
chorus
of
voices
therefore
give
me
wine
to
renew
my
strength
ellerey
cried
and
he
seized
the
tankard
held
out
to
him
it
is
madness
to
go
now
said
petrescu
for
you
perhaps
for
you
but
not
for
me
man
man
do
not
you
understand
besides
the
woman
whose
truth
i
would
vindicate
is
not
maritza
there
she
once
gave
me
life
yonder
in
the
hills
even
less
than
love
would
repay
such
a
debt
as
that
comrades
we
may
fight
side
by
side
in
the
streets
of
sturatzberg
but
this
hour
is
my
own
let
me
pass
it
is
death
to
rebel
or
soldier
who
seeks
to
stay
me
and
throwing
down
the
empty
tankard
he
went
quickly
to
the
door
followed
by
baron
petrescu
and
stefan
chapter
xxv
love
and
pity
long
before
midnight
frina
mavrodin
had
completed
her
work
of
preparation
the
servants
who
were
in
her
confidence
had
been
told
of
the
coming
of
the
princess
some
were
at
the
main
entrance
ready
to
admit
her
if
she
came
that
way
others
were
waiting
at
a
small
door
which
opened
from
the
garden
into
a
side
street
they
were
instructed
to
show
surprise
but
not
consternation
should
any
officer
of
the
king
demand
admittance
and
servants
were
stationed
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
corridors
a
signal
arranged
between
them
so
that
news
of
any
such
demand
might
be
immediately
conveyed
to
the
countess
silently
and
without
any
man
rushing
to
her
and
causing
suspicion
to
those
who
entered
if
captain
ellerey
comes
let
him
pass
to
me
at
once
she
said
and
at
the
usual
hour
put
out
all
lights
that
shine
upon
the
street
this
house
must
seem
to
sleep
no
matter
how
wakeful
it
may
be
only
a
dim
light
burned
in
her
own
room
which
looked
toward
the
garden
and
here
the
countess
paced
up
and
down
with
slow
thoughtful
steps
she
had
changed
the
dress
she
had
worn
at
court
that
night
for
a
soft
loose
gown
of
delicate
rose
color
caught
in
at
the
waist
by
a
silken
girdle
of
a
deep
shade
of
the
same
color
a
filmy
cloud
of
lace
was
about
her
throat
and
fell
over
her
shoulders
and
from
the
short
loose
sleeves
once
or
twice
she
stopped
before
a
glass
to
set
a
wayward
tress
of
her
hair
in
its
place
or
to
arrange
the
falling
folds
of
the
lace
and
perhaps
lingered
for
a
moment
in
contemplation
of
her
own
reflection
half
conscious
that
she
looked
fairer
dressed
as
she
was
than
in
court
attire
of
costly
silks
and
flashing
jewels
many
times
she
paused
at
the
open
window
drawing
aside
the
curtains
to
listen
for
footsteps
in
the
garden
and
she
listened
often
for
footsteps
in
the
corridor
princess
maritza
was
coming
perhaps
desmond
ellerey
would
come
too
how
to
outwit
the
king
should
desmond
ellerey
fall
into
his
hands
she
did
not
know
she
thought
of
little
else
as
she
paced
the
room
but
no
solution
of
the
problem
came
to
her
if
he
should
be
taken
it
seemed
as
if
he
must
suffer
for
the
cause
into
which
he
had
been
pressed
if
by
her
betrayal
of
others
he
only
could
be
saved
she
knew
now
that
he
must
perish
there
was
no
thought
in
her
mind
of
writing
out
a
list
of
names
to
send
to
the
king
she
put
her
hands
before
her
eyes
to
shut
out
the
hideous
vision
which
rose
before
her
ellerey
standing
with
folded
arms
facing
a
dozen
loaded
muskets
waiting
for
the
order
to
fire
but
even
in
her
vision
the
face
of
the
traitor
firm
resolute
determined
in
this
supreme
hour
as
it
had
been
throughout
his
life
as
it
would
be
in
reality
when
such
time
came
thrilled
her
soul
and
made
him
only
the
greater
hero
oh
to
be
at
his
side
then
she
exclaimed
in
a
low
voice
what
would
i
not
give
to
share
that
death
with
him
but
ellerey
was
not
yet
in
the
king
hands
that
seemed
certain
she
felt
convinced
that
some
time
before
the
dawn
she
would
see
him
that
he
would
enter
the
house
to
stand
by
maritza
side
to
the
last
had
she
not
power
to
save
him
then
there
was
a
way
of
escape
for
the
princess
that
same
way
could
desmond
ellerey
go
he
and
maritza
should
go
together
to
find
in
some
other
land
a
quiet
haven
of
happiness
yes
she
murmured
her
little
hands
clasped
so
firmly
behind
her
that
the
rings
cut
into
the
flesh
though
she
hardly
noticed
it
yes
that
is
how
it
shall
be
even
if
my
life
pays
the
forfeit
they
shall
go
together
perhaps
when
his
happiness
is
greatest
he
will
sometimes
think
of
the
woman
who
helped
him
to
it
there
were
hurried
steps
in
the
corridor
and
the
next
moment
princess
maritza
and
dumitru
entered
so
far
the
fates
are
with
us
frina
said
the
princess
taking
the
countess
hands
in
hers
and
kissing
her
but
i
little
thought
to
use
your
house
again
as
a
refuge
it
may
prove
an
insecure
retreat
frina
answered
there
is
no
escape
from
this
room
i
have
arranged
another
place
for
you
come
and
come
quickly
are
you
suspected
countess
asked
dumitru
anxiously
i
fear
so
but
they
will
hardly
trouble
me
still
i
do
not
feel
that
you
are
safe
in
this
room
maritza
frina
led
the
way
down
several
corridors
and
up
and
down
short
flights
of
steps
until
she
came
to
the
room
where
hannah
waited
the
old
serving
woman
came
hurriedly
forward
as
the
door
opened
for
a
moment
she
did
not
recognize
maritza
in
her
boy
dress
and
it
was
not
until
she
spoke
that
the
old
woman
arms
were
stretched
out
with
trembling
eagerness
toward
her
and
her
joy
found
its
expression
in
tears
o
my
princess
o
my
dear
lady
was
all
she
could
say
dumitru
has
brought
her
back
you
see
hannah
said
the
countess
you
owe
dumitru
some
apology
for
the
hard
thoughts
you
have
had
of
him
go
with
him
while
i
speak
to
your
mistress
a
moment
gladly
now
she
has
come
back
said
hannah
and
then
i
be
looking
out
decent
garments
for
you
princess
i
should
not
wish
all
the
world
to
see
you
as
you
are
this
is
a
safer
retreat
for
me
is
it
said
maritza
glancing
round
the
room
when
hannah
had
closed
the
door
it
is
a
corner
of
your
house
i
do
not
know
frina
thanks
for
your
great
care
of
me
it
is
not
long
that
i
shall
trouble
you
what
do
you
mean
mean
why
that
the
days
for
sitting
idly
down
to
wait
are
over
there
has
been
deadly
work
in
the
bergenstrasse
and
the
king
will
seek
to
avenge
it
do
you
suppose
i
shall
leave
them
without
a
leader
before
dawn
those
who
love
me
will
be
preparing
for
the
final
struggle
work
will
convince
many
who
until
now
have
wavered
rest
assured
there
will
be
a
goodly
host
about
me
when
the
king
sends
to
take
me
it
is
madness
maritza
exclaimed
the
countess
what
can
these
men
untrained
undisciplined
as
they
are
do
against
the
troops
which
even
now
doubtless
are
pouring
into
every
street
wait
my
dear
frina
you
are
a
woman
i
in
heart
at
least
am
a
man
hundreds
are
in
jeopardy
because
of
me
would
you
have
me
desert
them
you
were
wont
to
be
of
better
courage
but
wait
wait
for
counsel
and
advice
from
whom
asked
maritza
from
desmond
ellerey
the
two
women
were
looking
into
each
other
eyes
neither
fully
understood
the
struggle
in
the
other
heart
yet
each
of
them
knew
something
of
the
other
secret
for
some
moments
there
was
silence
is
desmond
ellerey
here
asked
maritza
presently
no
but
he
will
come
something
tells
me
that
he
will
come
wait
until
then
maritza
that
door
frina
went
on
pointing
to
one
which
was
hardly
discernible
from
the
panelled
walls
of
the
room
opens
into
a
passage
which
leads
to
a
small
building
by
the
river
where
there
is
only
rubbish
no
one
is
likely
to
search
there
hannah
has
the
key
and
it
is
a
way
of
escape
if
they
come
to
this
house
i
implore
you
to
wait
for
captain
ellerey
has
he
not
struggled
for
you
is
he
not
returning
to
sturatzberg
to
stand
beside
you
in
the
hour
of
your
need
rather
than
take
the
road
to
safety
as
he
might
have
done
have
you
not
a
hundred
times
in
your
heart
chosen
him
the
champion
of
your
cause
if
he
comes
he
may
help
me
but
i
can
not
wait
was
the
answer
the
people
call
for
me
they
shall
not
call
in
vain
maritza
maritza
i
tell
you
it
is
madness
be
persuaded
think
of
your
love
for
him
think
of
his
love
for
you
ah
you
must
be
ruled
by
me
in
this
the
countess
went
on
desperately
i
might
let
you
go
to
your
death
i
have
been
tempted
to
let
you
go
yes
it
is
true
look
at
me
as
you
will
mine
has
been
the
waiting
part
and
temptation
comes
easily
then
more
than
once
it
has
nearly
conquered
me
only
the
king
persuaded
me
to
betray
his
enemies
to
him
i
am
to
send
a
list
of
them
no
it
is
in
a
few
hours
you
have
promised
to
do
this
said
the
princess
laying
her
hand
sharply
on
her
companion
arm
i
promised
to
think
of
it
aye
and
when
i
made
the
promise
i
meant
to
think
of
it
shall
i
tell
you
why
and
frina
looked
straight
into
maritza
eyes
the
king
made
me
believe
that
desmond
ellerey
was
already
in
his
hands
and
he
swore
to
spare
him
if
i
would
do
his
bidding
it
was
the
keenest
temptation
he
could
have
assailed
me
with
do
you
understand
maritza
and
you
will
send
that
list
repeated
the
princess
can
you
ask
the
question
now
no
i
have
fought
my
battle
and
won
what
is
to
come
will
be
easy
after
the
stress
of
that
fight
but
that
the
king
should
so
tempt
me
shows
that
i
am
suspected
therefore
you
are
here
in
this
room
with
the
means
of
escape
at
hand
wait
for
captain
ellerey
maritza
for
the
present
at
least
i
believe
your
cause
is
lost
but
a
way
of
escape
desperate
though
it
be
still
lies
open
and
you
will
take
it
with
the
man
you
love
to
defend
you
wait
maritza
the
hand
that
had
rested
on
frina
arm
stole
slowly
round
her
and
the
princess
kissed
her
i
understand
she
whispered
i
have
had
my
struggle
too
i
have
never
forgotten
that
meeting
long
ago
in
england
and
now
now
i
love
him
ah
frina
you
may
pity
me
many
a
time
in
the
hills
i
longed
to
cry
out
to
him
to
take
me
northward
into
safety
to
give
me
love
instead
of
helping
me
to
a
kingdom
and
then
would
surge
into
my
soul
the
memory
of
my
fathers
and
i
felt
myself
a
coward
if
you
have
been
tempted
to
treachery
so
have
i
have
my
mission
to
fulfil
my
work
is
before
me
and
there
is
no
place
for
love
in
it
if
ever
i
call
any
man
husband
he
must
be
a
king
who
will
satisfy
the
state
but
he
loves
you
maritza
do
not
make
it
harder
for
me
sister
of
mine
fate
deals
ungently
with
us
both
if
desmond
comes
before
daybreak
bring
him
to
me
and
he
shall
give
me
counsel
should
i
taste
failure
should
i
should
i
never
see
him
again
say
to
him
maritza
yes
speak
my
name
and
say
that
you
loved
me
too
if
i
understand
him
he
will
love
you
for
that
i
am
very
weary
and
have
much
to
do
send
hannah
to
me
and
let
me
sleep
in
silence
the
two
women
kissed
each
other
and
then
frina
returned
to
her
room
while
maritza
threw
herself
on
a
couch
hannah
watching
beside
her
dumitru
stood
sentinel
outside
her
door
for
frina
there
was
no
sleep
only
a
restless
pacing
to
and
fro
and
a
longing
for
the
end
surely
the
end
would
come
the
dim
light
in
her
room
grew
dimmer
paling
before
the
coming
day
a
bird
in
the
garden
whistled
a
long
note
and
after
a
silence
it
was
answered
from
another
part
of
the
garden
and
then
quickly
from
another
a
star
gleamed
low
in
the
purple
of
the
east
the
herald
of
the
dawn
and
from
her
window
frina
watched
it
wondering
there
was
mystery
in
the
breaking
of
a
new
day
would
her
eyes
behold
its
setting
what
thoughts
would
be
in
her
brain
as
the
golden
light
faded
once
more
into
the
black
pall
of
night
she
turned
from
the
window
sharply
as
she
heard
quick
footsteps
in
the
corridor
long
hours
had
she
waited
for
them
and
now
they
had
come
her
heart
seemed
to
throb
violently
to
a
sudden
standstill
and
having
taken
one
hurried
step
toward
the
door
she
paused
as
it
opened
and
desmond
ellerey
stood
before
her
looking
forward
to
this
meeting
it
had
seemed
to
frina
mavrodin
that
in
it
her
life
must
reach
a
crisis
but
the
reality
fitted
none
of
her
preconceived
notions
of
what
this
meeting
would
be
like
dress
was
there
was
a
rent
in
his
sleeve
and
he
looked
as
though
he
had
come
through
some
struggle
she
noted
all
this
but
it
was
the
expression
on
his
face
which
fixed
her
attention
it
was
stern
unyielding
desperate
and
her
frame
stiffened
and
a
flash
came
into
her
eyes
as
though
she
were
angry
at
his
intrusion
the
princess
countess
said
ellerey
is
sleeping
she
answered
i
would
see
her
she
has
need
of
your
counsel
come
she
swept
past
him
without
another
word
without
looking
at
him
even
and
led
the
way
dumitru
stood
at
the
door
doubly
alert
at
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
one
hand
was
thrust
inside
his
cloak
and
it
was
easy
to
guess
what
his
fingers
played
with
there
he
smiled
as
he
saw
who
the
newcomer
was
welcome
captain
he
whispered
is
all
well
sleeping
was
the
low
answer
frina
opened
the
door
softly
and
then
she
motioned
ellerey
to
enter
but
he
came
no
farther
than
the
threshold
the
princess
lay
on
a
couch
sleeping
peacefully
dreaming
pleasantly
it
may
be
for
her
lips
were
half
parted
in
a
smile
one
arm
was
thrown
above
her
head
her
fingers
thrust
through
her
bright
curls
and
over
her
feet
hannah
had
spread
a
rug
a
lamp
was
still
burning
on
a
table
and
the
glow
from
it
lit
up
the
graceful
figure
for
some
moments
ellerey
gazed
upon
the
sleeper
taking
in
the
whole
picture
shall
i
wake
her
asked
frina
no
let
her
sleep
awhile
said
ellerey
as
he
went
back
into
the
corridor
then
he
turned
to
dumitru
is
there
a
way
of
escape
open
yes
when
will
you
go
when
the
princess
commands
unless
it
should
be
necessary
suddenly
dumitru
answered
there
are
servants
watching
who
will
let
me
know
the
countess
has
arranged
he
knew
nothing
of
the
tale
which
had
been
told
concerning
the
countess
frina
had
closed
the
door
and
stood
beside
them
but
she
did
not
speak
as
ellerey
turned
and
showed
that
he
had
no
other
question
to
ask
dumitru
she
led
the
way
back
but
at
the
door
of
her
room
she
paused
you
have
come
to
protect
the
princess
captain
ellerey
you
are
welcome
use
my
house
and
my
servants
as
you
think
fit
countess
will
you
give
me
leave
to
speak
to
you
a
few
moments
you
must
he
followed
her
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
then
frina
turned
facing
him
and
waited
countess
i
entered
sturatzberg
by
a
way
you
know
of
doubtless
to
hear
two
things
one
that
princess
maritza
had
been
rescued
and
brought
to
your
house
the
other
that
you
were
a
traitress
frina
started
but
ellerey
went
on
quickly
hear
me
to
the
end
heaven
knows
i
am
in
no
mood
to
take
you
unawares
the
man
who
brought
this
tale
of
you
came
from
the
palace
why
you
should
have
been
spied
upon
i
neither
know
nor
care
but
every
word
you
said
to
the
king
last
night
was
heard
and
out
of
them
came
this
story
that
you
had
agreed
to
betray
to
his
majesty
all
those
who
favor
the
cause
of
princess
maritza
no
hear
me
out
countess
i
swore
it
was
a
lie
petrescu
stefan
and
i
came
together
do
you
know
countess
that
this
house
is
surrounded
watched
by
the
king
troops
every
way
of
entrance
that
the
baron
knew
of
was
guarded
and
only
after
long
waiting
have
we
managed
to
scale
the
garden
wall
and
get
in
unseen
what
does
it
mean
is
the
princess
trapped
if
she
is
who
has
betrayed
her
she
was
silent
but
her
eyes
did
not
fall
before
his
for
heaven
sake
speak
countess
the
tale
is
untrue
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
yet
yes
yes
tell
me
i
have
pledged
my
honor
trample
on
it
if
you
will
only
tell
me
the
truth
now
i
have
been
tempted
she
said
yes
you
shall
hear
the
truth
i
have
been
tempted
perhaps
even
i
have
stumbled
but
i
have
not
fallen
i
am
a
woman
first
then
a
conspirator
and
i
have
had
many
idle
hours
look
into
my
eyes
read
my
secret
if
you
can
and
judge
me
i
was
tempted
and
the
king
words
seemed
for
a
moment
to
help
my
decision
i
did
not
promise
to
betray
but
i
did
promise
to
think
of
betraying
to
gain
time
that
was
it
merely
to
gain
time
said
ellerey
no
i
think
when
i
promised
i
had
almost
decided
to
act
ah
how
could
you
ellerey
exclaimed
you
have
heard
the
story
were
you
told
the
bribe
the
king
offered
ellerey
did
not
answer
but
frina
understood
in
a
moment
that
he
did
know
yes
captain
ellerey
that
tempted
me
but
with
it
came
a
clearer
knowledge
and
i
saw
that
for
me
only
one
road
lay
open
i
have
taken
it
maritza
is
in
a

temptation

ellerey
stood
with
lowered
head
his
hands
pressed
before
his
face
what
can

say
countess

brought
into
my
life
two
noble
women
i
am
powerless

the
other
it
seems
i
have
only
given
sorrow

said
softly

powerful

the

was
suddenly
burst
open
and
stefan
entered
quick
captain
they
demanded
admission
which
was
refused
and
they
are
breaking
in
the
baron
and
those
with
him
will
hold
them
as
long
as
possible
the
princess
ellerey
exclaimed

been

stefan

time
said
frina

said
stefan
from
the
door
even
now
they
drive
the
servants
up
the
stairs
and
the
good
fellows
fight
every
inch
of
the

he
caught
her
hand
and
raised
it
to
his
lips

he
whispered
and
you
desmond
then
he
sprang
to
the
window

stefan
answered
as
ellerey
swung
himself
free
by
the
stout
branch
of
a
creeper
near
the
window
and
dropped
into
the
garden
chapter
xxvi
rebellion
the
servants
heartened
by
baron
petrescu
contested
the
stairs
step
by
step
with
all
the
odds
against
them
not
one
turned
to
fly
they
were
fighting
for
the
mistress
they
loved
and
were
staunch
to
a
man
some
fell
staining
the
thick
carpet
with
their
blood
yet
even
in
dying
struck
one
more
blow
as
the
soldiers
trampled
over
them
meeting
with
such
unexpected
resistance
made
the
soldiers
savage
and
there
was
no
quarter
given
or
asked
for
in
the
forefront
of
the
battle
petrescu
sword
did
deadly
work
for
so
mixed
up
were
besieged
and
besiegers
that
those
behind
dared
not
fire
it
was
a
struggle
steel
to
steel
and
although
there
could
be
no
real
doubt
of
the
issue
the
baron
knew
that
the
longer
he
could
hold
the
soldiers
in
check
the
more
time
would
the
princess
and
the
countess
have
to
get
away
stefan
was
silent
until
the
sound
of
ellerey
quick
steps
in
the
garden
had
ceased
where
does
that
lead
to
countess
he
said
pointing
to
a
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
to
my
bedroom
and
from
there
there
is
a
door
on
to
a
landing
seldom
used
she
answered
that
is
our
way
then
said
stefan
i
shall
stay
here
i
am
safe
from
them
it
is
only
the
king
who
would
dare
the
gentlemen
fighting
yonder
are
in
no
tender
mood
i
know
them
besides
the
captain
left
me
in
command
and
you
must
obey
countess
this
is
war
time
and
i
am
only
doing
my
duty
so
we
lock
this
outer
door
and
we
put
as
many
more
between
us
as
possible
is
this
your
cloak
yes
frina
answered
in
a
moment
stefan
had
ripped
a
piece
from
the
edge
of
it
and
stuck
it
in
the
creeper
at
the
window
and
thrown
the
cloak
into
the
garden
below
then
he
tore
down
one
of
the
curtains
they
think
we
gone
that
way
maybe
come
countess
you
can
get
another
cloak
as
we
pass
through
your
room
there
was
strength
in
this
great
bearded
soldier
and
besides
desmond
trusted
him
so
frina
mavrodin
obeyed
at
every
point
the
servants
were
driven
back
and
the
soldiers
spread
through
the
house
cutting
down
anyone
who
opposed
them
but
not
making
any
particular
effort
to
pursue
those
who
got
out
of
their
way
they
were
there
to
take
the
princess
maritza
and
the
countess
mavrodin
such
were
the
orders
the
officers
had
received
but
long
before
the
servants
had
given
way
on
the
stairs
hannah
had
opened
the
door
leading
to
the
passage
and
the
princess
and
dumitru
had
gone
together
swiftly
while
hannah
waited
for
the
coming
soldiers
her
heart
growing
the
lighter
the
longer
that
coming
was
delayed
she
had
locked
the
door
again
but
kept
the
key
lest
others
should
want
to
use
that
way
of
escape
presently
the
soldiers
rushed
in
at
last
and
hannah
face
assumed
an
astonished
look
as
if
they
had
roused
her
from
sleep
who
are
you
demanded
one
man
sharply
i
might
as
well
ask
that
question
of
you
she
replied
curtly
come
to
the
city
that
a
band
of
ruffians
break
into
an
old
serving
woman
room
before
she
scarce
awake
do
serving
women
sleep
on
couches
only
in
this
house
and
are
they
pampered
with
leopard
skins
for
covering
how
they
sleep
and
what
they
covered
with
is
none
of
your
affair
hannah
said
a
soft
tongue
will
serve
you
best
replied
the
man
tell
me
who
slept
on
that
couch
during
the
night
and
how
she
slept
and
what
she
dreamt
about
i
suppose
well
i
had
no
dreams
of
such
a
rough
awakening
as
this
other
men
were
turning
over
the
things
in
the
room
and
presently
one
espied
the
door
he
called
the
attention
of
the
others
to
it
at
once
open
it
they
cried
it
locked
the
key
woman
quickly
said
one
who
seemed
to
command
it
likely
i
shall
let
you
pry
into
my
cupboards
is
it
this
is
no
cupboard
give
me
the
key
i
have
got
it
said
hannah
and
with
a
sudden
swing
of
her
arm
she
sent
the
key
flying
through
the
open
window
with
unerring
aim
curse
you
cried
the
man
in
the
time
you
take
to
find
it
you
may
learn
better
manners
said
hannah
defiantly
brave
staunch
old
soul
full
worthy
of
that
devon
county
which
gave
her
birth
the
man
followed
his
curse
with
a
blow
a
heavy
blow
striking
with
the
hand
which
held
his
sword
and
the
woman
fell
with
a
thud
to
the
ground
to
lie
there
until
stefan
and
the
countess
stealing
from
the
house
presently
covered
the
dead
serving
woman
with
the
leopard
skin
to
find
the
key
was
hopeless
and
the
door
was
a
stout
one
it
resisted
the
soldiers
efforts
for
a
long
while
when
at
last
it
yielded
they
rushed
along
the
passage
to
the
small
house
by
the
river
but
save
for
rubbish
it
was
empty
no
boat
lay
upon
the
water
there
was
no
sign
of
the
fugitives
they
must
have
come
this
way
said
one
man
had
not
that
old
beldame
resisted
us
we
should
have
caught
them
back
to
the
house
comrades
shouted
another
there
should
still
be
something
there
worth
laying
hands
on
until
now
ellerey
had
waited
hidden
by
the
river
house
he
had
reached
it
almost
directly
after
the
princess
and
dumitru
had
left
it
but
ignorant
of
this
fact
he
had
waited
for
them
from
the
soldiers
words
he
learnt
the
truth
soldiers
were
in
the
garden
now
and
as
only
a
little
while
since
he
had
sought
to
enter
it
unseen
he
now
sought
to
leave
it
crouching
from
tree
to
tree
and
from
shrubbery
to
shrubbery
his
life
was
too
valuable
to
be
uselessly
thrown
away
he
succeeded
presently
in
scaling
a
wall
and
dropping
into
a
side
lane
to
fall
in
later
with
a
band
of
conspirators
some
of
whom
were
present
when
the
tale
of
the
countess
treachery
was
told
last
night
and
who
were
now
quietly
making
their
way
to
an
arranged
meeting
place
but
the
princess
comrades
said
ellerey
my
place
is
beside
her
fear
nothing
captain
she
will
come
and
help
us
to
make
this
day
a
glorious
one
in
sturatzberg
the
morning
was
advancing
but
people
who
respected
the
law
kept
within
their
houses
and
left
their
doors
fast
barred
from
early
dawn
the
soldiers
were
in
the
streets
and
it
was
evident
that
the
ordinary
business
of
life
must
be
suspended
as
the
hours
passed
there
were
sounds
of
fighting
on
every
side
the
fierce
rattle
of
musketry
at
street
corners
flying
men
charged
by
the
soldiers
turning
sometimes
into
every
alley
and
place
of
refuge
which
offered
turning
sometimes
at
the
shout
of
one
determined
leader
to
withstand
the
charge
to
be
cut
to
pieces
or
to
bear
the
soldiers
back
leaving
many
a
king
man
and
king
enemy
lying
dead
or
writhing
with
their
wounds
their
enmity
forgotten
in
their
common
suffering
in
one
side
street
soon
after
such
a
skirmish
had
swept
it
from
end
to
end
a
dark
figure
glided
from
door
to
door
he
had
not
fought
he
seemed
unwilling
to
do
so
for
at
the
sound
of
approaching
conflict
he
was
in
readiness
to
retreat
and
hide
himself
more
than
one
wounded
man
in
the
roadway
pleaded
for
help
or
cried
for
water
but
he
was
deaf
to
their
entreaties
he
was
making
all
speed
to
some
point
and
would
allow
nothing
to
hold
him
back
now
he
ran
forward
a
few
paces
now
stopped
and
turned
hastily
into
an
alley
and
went
quickly
on
again
he
came
at
last
to
the
house
of
frina
mavrodin
when
it
was
close
on
noon
the
door
at
the
chief
entrance
had
been
torn
from
its
hinges
there
was
nothing
to
bar
his
entrance
the
servants
who
had
escaped
death
had
fled
or
lay
hidden
in
secret
places
in
the
house
the
soldiers
had
deserted
it
finding
their
quarry
gone
to
go
and
help
their
comrades
in
the
streets
at
the
moment
the
street
was
empty
and
the
man
slipped
across
the
threshold
stepping
over
the
dead
which
lay
in
the
hall
grim
witnesses
of
the
fierceness
of
the
fight
there
the
man
passed
from
room
to
room
rapidly
his
ears
intent
to
catch
every
sound
it
was
clear
that
robbery
was
not
his
object
for
there
was
none
to
stay
him
taking
whatever
he
would
he
passed
on
touching
nothing
and
by
the
way
he
glanced
down
this
corridor
and
that
it
was
evident
that
the
house
was
not
familiar
to
him
chance
directed
his
footsteps
and
brought
him
to
the
room
where
princess
maritza
had
been
the
broken
door
at
the
further
end
attracted
his
notice
and
he
entered
the
room
stopping
for
a
moment
to
look
into
the
face
of
hannah
the
leopard
skin
had
not
been
thrown
over
her
yet
she
was
the
first
woman
lying
dead
he
had
come
across
and
he
grew
excited
she
had
been
killed
because
she
stood
in
the
way
and
she
would
not
have
stood
in
the
way
unless
she
had
had
someone
in
imminent
danger
to
defend
she
must
have
been
with
the
princess
he
argued
and
if
so
this
must
be
the
way
they
had
taken
he
went
quickly
along
the
passage
and
up
to
the
house
by
the
river
someone
had
certainly
been
there
but
which
direction
had
they
taken
afterward
he
glanced
to
right
and
left
and
stood
for
some
time
looking
across
the
river
he
would
not
leave
the
princess
and
he
would
take
her
as
far
as
possible
from
these
fighting
madmen
in
the
streets
he
mused
surely
he
can
not
escape
such
a
day
as
this
the
man
went
slowly
back
along
the
passage
again
and
then
he
stopped
suddenly
the
sound
of
voices
reached
him
distinctly
brave
woman
he
heard
one
say
it
was
a
woman
voice
and
the
heart
beat
high
cowards
to
treat
her
thus
came
the
muttered
answer
in
a
man
lower
tone
there
was
a
moment
silence
help
me
to
cover
her
said
the
woman
there
was
a
turn
in
the
passage
and
the
man
standing
waiting
there
could
not
see
into
the
room
but
the
passage
was
dark
and
if
those
in
the
room
came
that
way
they
were
not
likely
to
see
him
and
his
mouth
widened
into
a
malicious
smile
would
they
come
he
had
hardly
whispered
the
question
to
himself
when
it
was
evident
that
they
had
entered
the
passage
and
were
approaching
the
waiting
man
drew
back
against
the
wall
a
knife
in
his
hand
and
if
this
failed
his
other
hand
grasped
a
revolver
they
came
slowly
cautiously
and
just
before
the
turn
paused
it
was
clear
that
they
meant
to
be
careful
for
the
man
said
after
a
moment
hesitation
it
is
clear
then
he
came
but
alone
and
swiftly
with
his
sword
in
his
hand
the
waiting
man
had
not
recognized
stefan
voice
nor
had
he
done
so
would
he
have
feared
detection
stefan
eyes
and
ears
were
quick
however
and
in
that
pause
he
had
held
up
a
warning
finger
to
his
companion
and
had
then
sprung
forward
i
took
you
for
your
master
cried
the
waiting
man
when
he
saw
that
he
was
discovered
but
the
cruel
blade
flashed
swiftly
down
but
fell
on
stefan
sword
only
and
then
before
his
fingers
could
pull
the
trigger
of
his
revolver
the
sword
point
was
thrust
through
his
throat
and
the
man
who
had
so
stealthily
waited
for
his
victim
fell
back
against
the
wall
upright
for
a
moment
and
then
collapsed
only
a
gurgled
sigh
sounding
in
the
silent
passage
my
ancient
friend
of
the
cellar
said
stefan
bending
over
him
waiting
for
the
captain
eh
well
you
did
your
best
master
francois
and
so
i
will
report
to
your
master
should
i
find
him
come
countess
the
light
is
too
dim
to
see
the
unpleasant
sight
and
the
soldier
held
out
his
hand
to
her
frina
shuddered
a
little
as
she
stepped
past
the
fallen
man
and
she
and
stefan
went
slowly
out
of
the
passage
together
the
soldier
eyes
were
searching
and
keen
as
they
went
the
servant
was
dead
but
the
master
might
not
be
far
off
and
he
would
be
even
a
more
dangerous
enemy
they
passed
stealthily
from
street
to
street
much
as
francois
had
done
a
little
while
since
stefan
had
a
plan
a
goal
to
win
but
he
did
not
speak
of
it
to
the
countess
suddenly
frina
stopped
they
were
at
the
end
of
a
deserted
alley
but
the
roar
of
voices
came
from
a
distance
then
the
sudden
rattle
of
musketry
the
harsh
and
discordant
music
of
battle
which
way
now
she
asked
to
safety
said
stefan
while
others
fight
and
fall
she
said
so
the
captain
willed
it
i
will
go
no
further
toward
safety
not
yet
time
for
that
when
the
day
is
lost
our
way
lies
there
and
she
pointed
in
the
direction
from
which
the
roar
of
battle
came
countess
i
have
my
orders
and
have
obeyed
them
now
listen
to
mine
yonder
where
they
fight
lies
the
grande
place
lead
me
there
by
the
quietest
way
we
can
travel
that
is
to
go
to
your
death
listen
stefan
and
look
she
pointed
to
the
street
into
which
the
alley
opened
some
men
were
running
swiftly
to
the
battle
i
have
but
to
cry
my
name
and
they
will
come
to
me
shall
i
cry
for
heaven
sake
countess
then
lead
me
as
i
say
i
can
not
i
dare
not
the
captain
follow
me
then
if
you
will
and
before
he
could
stop
her
she
had
darted
from
him
stay
cried
stefan
rushing
after
her
stay
if
you
will
go
let
me
lead
you
show
me
the
quiet
ways
if
you
can
but
come
and
though
stefan
argued
though
he
tried
to
deceive
her
at
every
corner
they
came
to
she
would
not
be
turned
from
her
purpose
ever
as
they
went
the
roar
of
battle
grew
louder
in
their
ears
and
there
was
fear
in
the
heart
of
stefan
the
soldier
because
of
the
woman
who
walked
beside
him
francois
was
dead
that
was
one
enemy
the
less
but
of
the
master
there
was
no
sign
it
had
been
as
wakeful
a
night
for
jules
de
froilette
as
it
had
been
for
frina
mavrodin
but
he
had
spent
it
in
no
restless
pacing
up
and
down
nor
in
listening
for
expected
footsteps
francois
he
knew
was
prowling
about
the
streets
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
the
servant
had
come
hastily
and
told
his
master
of
the
rescue
of
princess
maritza
de
froilette
had
turned
pale
and
dropped
back
in
his
chair
dumbfounded
at
the
news
but
he
quickly
recovered
himself
her
freedom
could
be
only
temporary
there
might
be
some
street
fighting
but
her
was
certain
francois
had
neither
heard
nor
seen
anything
of
captain
ellerey
but
he
was
sure
to
come
and
the
servant
had
gone
out
to
roam
about
the
city
again
in
search
of
him
jules
de
froilette
spent
his
time
in
busily
destroying
papers
now
and
then
placing
an
important
one
aside
sometimes
reading
one
with
greater
care
and
hesitating
over
it
at
intervals
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
remained
buried
in
thought
for
awhile
and
once
he
got
up
and
went
to
a
side
table
on
which
stood
the
portrait
of
queen
elena
if
ellerey
were
out
of
the
way
we
might
win
through
yet
he
mused
i
wonder
what
has
become
of
the
bracelet
of
medallions
if
it
were
in
my
hands
i
might
save
the
situation
or
the
queen
might
have
to
leave
sturatzberg
and
then
who
is
there
to
protect
her
but
me
the
dawn
found
him
still
sorting
and
destroying
he
expected
francois
to
return
with
further
news
but
the
servant
did
not
come
the
altstrasse
began
to
wake
and
grew
noisy
at
an
earlier
hour
than
usual
the
fact
made
de
froilette
lean
back
in
his
chair
in
thought
again
the
news
that
the
princess
had
escaped
was
spreading
that
was
natural
and
with
the
town
in
an
uproar
rebellion
in
the
air
there
were
many
who
would
look
to
him
for
a
sign
they
had
been
waiting
for
it
and
expecting
it
hourly
during
the
last
few
days
had
he
not
for
a
long
time
been
fostering
rebellion
a
revolt
that
should
set
him
in
high
place
that
should
bring
him
riches
from
russian
coffers
that
should
bring
him
love
was
not
his
house
at
this
moment
full
of
men
to
whom
he
had
promised
much
men
who
should
presently
help
the
brigands
to
seize
the
city
and
then
in
their
turn
be
quelled
and
crushed
by
russia
whose
army
on
the
frontier
was
only
awaiting
the
word
from
him
his
scheme
had
failed
through
this
cursed
englishman
but
de
froilette
had
not
dared
to
tell
the
waiting
men
so
had
not
dared
to
tell
them
at
any
moment
he
might
be
compelled
to
fly
for
safety
they
were
rebels
and
would
be
quick
to
see
treachery
in
any
failure
when
they
had
not
even
been
given
the
chance
to
strike
a
blow
for
success
presently
a
servant
brought
him
coffee
and
some
rolls
the
city
is
noisy
de
froilette
said
yes
monsieur
where
is
the
rioting
chiefly
toward
the
southern
gate
they
say
monsieur
but
the
soldiers
are
everywhere
what
about
the
northern
gate
and
the
bois
it
is
quieter
that
way
monsieur
i
am
told
de
froilette
nodded
and
the
servant
went
out
the
altstrasse
became
quieter
presently
the
men
had
gone
to
swell
the
crowds
in
the
bergenstrasse
not
to
fight
perhaps
but
to
hang
about
in
side
streets
and
seize
whatever
loot
they
could
with
dead
and
dying
men
lying
in
the
roadway
there
would
be
much
to
be
picked
up
many
of
the
women
had
gone
too
for
in
the
altstrasse
much
of
the
human
refuse
of
the
city
had
its
home
and
sex
counted
for
little
it
was
toward
noon
that
de
froilette
door
opened
suddenly
and
a
tall
figure
cloaked
to
the
eyes
glided
in
closing
the
door
in
an
instant
de
froilette
was
on
his
feet
and
then
as
the
man
let
the
cloak
fall
apart
he
exclaimed
vasilici
yes
vasilici
was
the
answer
they
are
not
your
men
who
are
fighting
in
the
streets
are
they
asked
de
froilette
a
ray
of
hope
in
his
eyes
no
my
men
remain
in
the
hills
we
have
been
overreached
said
de
froilette
but
only
for
a
little
while
it
was
a
good
move
of
yours
to
deliver
up
the
princess
although
it
might
have
been
wiser
to
shoot
her
there
will
be
many
lives
lost
through
her
today
she
escaped
last
night
do
you
know
that
i
have
heard
nothing
else
since
i
entered
the
city
returned
the
brigand
it
was
bold
of
you
to
enter
it
at
all
just
now
said
de
froilette
i
am
used
to
dangers
said
the
brigand
grandiloquently
and
i
had
business
with
you
with
me
with
you
and
with
one
other
vasilici
answered
it
was
fortunate
this
princess
came
into
our
hands
we
learnt
many
things
we
were
to
do
the
fighting
monsieur
but
to
have
little
of
the
reward
that
was
for
the
russians
lying
on
the
frontier
it
was
a
pretty
plot
you
and
the
queen
had
arranged
whose
tale
is
that
vasilici
you
are
easily
deceived
if
you
believe
it
we
learnt
the
truth
when
we
received
this
monsieur
and
the
brigand
held
up
the
bracelet
of
medallions
whoever
your
messenger
was
he
lied
to
you
said
de
froilette
her
majesty
shall
presently
convince
you
of
that
i
will
return
the
bracelet
to
her
vasilici
burst
out
laughing
his
quick
eyes
had
taken
in
every
detail
of
the
room
had
noted
what
lay
upon
the
table
had
keenly
scanned
his
companion
from
head
to
foot
we
are
not
all
fools
in
the
hills
monsieur
i
am
going
to
deliver
this
to
her
majesty
myself
she
is
the
other
i
spoke
of
with
whom
i
have
business
in
sturatzberg
ah
you
are
clever
he
went
on
replacing
the
bracelet
in
his
pocket
but
you
have
failed
we
are
not
to
be
sold
to
russia
just
yet
and
by
a
foreigner
too
exterminate
the
foreigners
monsieur
that
has
been
your
cry
it
is
a
good
one
tell
me
why
should
you
go
free
he
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
with
a
sudden
spring
his
glittering
dagger
raised
to
strike
he
was
upon
his
adversary
but
the
blow
fell
limply
and
his
fingers
relaxed
letting
the
knife
fall
with
a
clatter
upon
the
table
the
brigand
swaggering
courage
had
risen
as
he
contemplated
his
defenceless
enemy
from
the
moment
of
his
entrance
however
the
frenchman
understood
that
he
came
in
no
friendly
mood
and
was
prepared
as
vasilici
sprang
forward
two
shots
in
quick
succession
startled
the
echoes
of
the
room
and
the
tall
figure
swayed
for
a
moment
then
fell
sideways
on
to
the
table
and
slithered
to
the
ground
in
an
instant
de
froilette
was
at
the
door
and
had
locked
it
there
were
running
feet
in
the
passage
without
and
cries
of
monsieur
monsieur
it
is
nothing
de
froilette
shouted
the
weapon
was
loaded
and
i
had
forgotten
the
fact
i
am
not
hurt
at
once
as
the
servants
departed
de
froilette
bent
over
the
dead
body
fool
to
think
to
make
an
end
of
me
so
easily
and
he
took
the
bracelet
from
the
dead
man
pocket
in
bringing
this
you
have
served
me
and
i
thank
you
i
would
give
you
decent
burial
had
i
the
leisure
but
time
presses
you
must
rest
here
until
they
find
you
de
froilette
hastily
put
some
papers
in
his
pocket
and
reloading
the
two
chambers
of
his
revolver
slipped
that
too
into
his
pocket
now
if
i
can
only
see
ellerey
as
silent
as
this
brute
i
can
laugh
at
them
all
with
the
bracelet
in
my
possession
i
am
safe
it
will
buy
the
king
courtesy
or
if
it
suits
better
the
queen
obedience
i
thank
you
friend
vasilici
and
with
a
mocking
bow
to
the
lifeless
brigand
de
froilette
took
up
his
hat
and
cloak
and
left
the
room
by
a
door
concealed
in
the
wall
behind
his
writing
table
chapter
xxvii
in
purple
and
red
and
gold
the
attack
upon
the
countess
mavrodin
house
had
commenced
soon
after
daybreak
at
that
early
hour
few
persons
were
abroad
in
the
streets
except
the
soldiers
who
had
been
hastily
marched
to
all
points
of
vantage
in
the
city
as
soon
as
the
escape
of
the
princess
became
known
but
it
was
not
until
an
hour
or
two
later
that
the
news
of
the
attack
and
the
desperate
resistance
the
soldiers
had
met
with
began
to
circulate
when
the
riot
which
had
resulted
in
maritza
rescue
had
been
quelled
and
the
rioters
had
melted
away
before
the
onslaught
of
the
troops
it
was
hoped
that
a
salutary
lesson
had
been
administered
which
would
prevent
any
recurrence
of
open
rebellion
that
the
princess
could
not
long
elude
recapture
seemed
certain
and
her
brief
triumph
had
been
dearly
paid
for
citizens
lying
dead
in
the
streets
were
a
grim
reminder
of
the
reality
of
law
and
order
the
strenuous
defence
of
the
countess
mavrodin
house
had
come
as
a
severe
blow
to
the
complacency
of
the
authorities
it
seemed
probable
that
princess
maritza
had
found
shelter
there
that
she
was
actually
in
the
house
when
the
attack
was
made
and
her
defenders
had
succeeded
in
holding
the
soldiers
back
until
she
had
escaped
but
this
was
not
all
it
was
evident
that
it
was
not
only
upon
the
rabble
that
the
princess
could
depend
her
cause
was
espoused
by
frina
mavrodin
and
those
who
had
considered
her
only
a
beautiful
frivolous
woman
awoke
to
the
fact
that
she
had
power
and
unlimited
wealth
she
had
played
a
part
she
had
become
a
lady
bountiful
in
sturatzberg
and
it
was
easy
to
understand
how
far
reaching
her
commands
might
be
at
this
crisis
baron
petrescu
too
had
been
a
prominent
figure
in
the
resistance
which
had
been
made
and
was
still
unharmed
it
was
impossible
to
foretell
how
many
others
from
one
cause
or
another
that
the
attack
had
been
successfully
resisted
in
so
far
that
the
princess
had
been
able
to
escape
gave
an
enormous
stimulus
to
the
courage
of
the
rebels
the
death
of
companions
last
night
had
had
a
sobering
effect
upon
some
they
were
inclined
to
argue
that
they
had
done
what
they
had
set
out
to
do
and
that
for
the
present
enough
had
been
accomplished
but
the
news
of
the
morning
raised
fresh
passions
within
them
and
their
leaders
were
not
slow
to
add
fuel
to
the
furnace
these
enthusiasts
declared
that
it
was
only
necessary
to
seize
the
advantage
already
gained
to
win
the
city
and
to
force
their
will
upon
the
country
was
not
their
princess
among
them
had
not
important
persons
already
declared
for
her
were
there
not
hundreds
of
others
ready
to
do
so
only
that
fear
of
the
people
fickleness
and
held
them
back
so
the
carefully
secreted
arms
were
taken
out
again
there
were
stir
and
determination
in
every
corner
of
the
city
the
word
had
gone
forth
that
the
day
so
long
looked
for
had
indeed
come
that
before
nightfall
sturatzberg
would
be
in
their
hands
that
maritza
their
sovereign
would
most
surely
come
amongst
them
in
the
grande
place
to
lead
them
and
that
by
noon
all
loyal
men
must
win
their
way
there
it
was
no
mere
rabble
to
whom
this
command
was
given
some
organization
at
least
had
been
proceeding
for
a
long
time
points
of
meeting
were
known
leaders
had
been
chosen
and
accepted
men
who
knew
every
alley
and
byway
of
the
city
and
had
made
a
study
of
street
fighting
the
cover
to
be
had
and
taken
advantage
of
and
the
narrow
ways
where
the
soldiers
would
manoeuvre
at
a
disadvantage
being
compelled
to
fight
singly
and
hand
to
hand
as
the
morning
advanced
separate
bands
traversed
the
meaner
streets
avoiding
conflict
for
the
present
as
much
as
possible
here
and
there
sharp
skirmishes
took
place
but
no
determined
effort
was
made
to
rush
the
soldiers
nor
were
the
soldiers
successful
in
dispersing
those
with
whom
they
came
in
conflict
except
perhaps
to
make
them
change
their
route
the
rebel
leaders
had
no
wish
to
make
boldly
for
the
grande
place
before
noon
that
would
only
be
to
make
known
what
their
objective
was
when
the
time
came
their
numbers
would
be
overpowering
and
when
once
the
soldiers
saw
that
they
were
hemmed
in
many
of
them
would
be
fighting
with
them
instead
of
against
them
was
it
not
common
knowledge
that
among
the
troops
there
was
dissatisfaction
desmond
ellerey
had
fallen
in
with
one
of
these
bands
when
he
escaped
from
frina
garden
the
leader
a
lusty
enthusiast
who
had
already
looked
forward
to
the
rewards
which
must
accrue
from
this
day
victory
could
tell
him
all
that
was
to
happen
but
of
maritza
whereabouts
at
that
moment
he
knew
nothing
all
he
was
sure
of
was
that
she
would
be
in
the
grande
place
at
the
appointed
time
he
was
a
skilful
leader
he
took
his
followers
by
a
multitude
of
back
streets
avoiding
every
point
where
soldiers
were
likely
to
be
every
man
was
valuable
and
to
lose
even
one
in
a
skirmish
which
could
achieve
nothing
was
to
jeopardize
the
success
of
the
rebellion
to
that
extent
he
constantly
turned
aside
to
avoid
some
particular
corner
which
the
scouts
sent
on
before
reported
occupied
but
although
this
often
necessitated
returning
for
some
distance
along
the
way
they
had
come
he
managed
gradually
to
approach
the
place
of
rendezvous
until
a
little
before
noon
he
had
brought
his
band
into
an
alley
opening
out
of
one
of
the
streets
which
led
directly
into
the
grande
place
an
excellent
battle
ground
for
us
he
said
turning
to
ellerey
the
space
is
confined
narrow
streets
abound
for
us
to
fight
in
which
will
prevent
the
soldiers
rushing
us
or
bringing
guns
into
action
ellerey
nodded
but
his
heart
was
heavy
enthusiasm
might
accomplish
much
but
he
did
not
believe
in
the
ability
of
the
rebels
to
withstand
the
military
force
which
would
be
opposed
to
them
after
last
night
sturatzberg
was
not
likely
to
be
caught
asleep
what
was
this
day
to
bring
to
the
woman
he
loved
if
he
could
have
known
that
she
was
in
safety
he
could
have
drawn
his
sword
with
a
lighter
heart
and
struck
boldly
for
her
cause
died
for
it
if
need
be
but
she
was
not
safe
unless
she
had
already
fallen
into
the
hands
of
her
enemies
she
was
coming
to
the
grande
place
she
had
promised
and
that
promise
was
the
mainspring
of
the
enthusiasm
which
was
on
every
side
of
him
he
knew
her
too
well
even
to
hope
that
she
would
not
come
and
her
coming
must
mean
death
his
love
made
him
afraid
he
could
not
see
even
the
barest
possibility
of
victory
nor
had
he
any
hope
that
she
could
escape
now
love
made
him
a
coward
his
vital
force
seemed
numbed
and
his
hand
shook
he
had
been
an
entire
stranger
to
such
a
sense
of
fear
until
this
moment
and
it
was
only
with
a
great
effort
that
he
was
able
to
throw
off
the
paralyzing
effect
it
had
upon
him
from
the
tower
of
the
hotel
de
ville
the
hour
of
noon
sounded
clear
and
musically
over
the
city
ready
said
the
leader
but
the
princess
said
ellerey
she
will
come
was
the
answer
would
she
the
striking
of
the
hour
was
evidently
the
signal
the
last
stroke
had
not
died
away
when
the
men
moved
out
from
the
alley
into
the
street
and
went
quickly
towards
the
grande
place
similar
bands
of
men
came
from
other
alleys
and
from
every
street
they
poured
impetuously
into
the
square
no
place
had
been
assigned
to
ellerey
no
duty
had
devolved
upon
him
and
as
the
forward
rush
was
made
he
contrived
to
keep
at
the
side
of
the
street
so
that
he
might
not
be
forced
to
the
front
of
the
crowd
once
in
the
square
he
stepped
aside
sheltering
himself
in
the
angle
of
a
wall
and
no
one
noticed
his
movements
as
they
rushed
past
him
there
were
comparatively
few
soldiers
in
the
grande
place
and
for
them
the
striking
of
noon
had
had
no
warning
the
sharp
rattle
of
musketry
came
swiftly
but
in
a
moment
the
soldiers
were
swept
back
or
beaten
down
there
was
a
triumphant
shout
at
this
success
but
the
men
were
well
in
hand
they
did
not
attempt
to
follow
the
enemy
into
the
side
streets
into
which
they
were
driven
but
having
in
the
first
onslaught
seized
every
entrance
to
the
square
took
up
their
positions
to
hold
them
for
a
few
moments
there
was
silence
save
for
the
quick
commands
of
rebel
leaders
and
the
hurrying
feet
of
men
taking
their
appointed
places
they
were
heartened
and
enthusiastic
they
had
only
to
hold
the
grande
place
for
a
while
comrades
were
marching
from
every
quarter
of
the
city
and
the
soldiers
would
be
between
two
fires
so
the
leaders
encouraged
and
the
men
believed
and
were
content
ellerey
still
remained
in
the
angle
of
the
wall
endeavoring
to
attract
as
little
attention
as
possible
were
he
seen
and
recognized
some
position
of
command
was
likely
to
be
thrust
upon
him
and
this
he
was
most
anxious
to
avoid
his
place
was
beside
maritza
when
she
came
one
man
spoke
to
him
asking
him
what
orders
he
had
received
to
protect
the
princess
he
answered
the
man
gave
him
a
friendly
nod
and
ellerey
conceived
that
to
certain
men
some
such
command
had
been
given
and
that
his
answer
was
a
happy
one
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
square
came
the
crack
of
rifles
again
quickly
answered
the
rebels
were
well
armed
and
whatever
the
issue
the
struggle
was
to
be
a
desperate
one
here
was
no
loose
rabble
to
turn
and
flee
but
enthusiasts
bent
on
disputing
every
inch
of
the
way
charge
came
an
order
from
the
distance
and
there
followed
the
sudden
growling
of
conflict
yonder
the
battle
had
begun
in
earnest
and
a
moment
later
a
roar
of
triumph
proclaimed
that
the
soldiers
had
been
thrust
back
there
was
wisdom
in
making
them
fight
in
narrow
streets
it
was
difficult
for
ellerey
to
remain
where
he
was
fighting
was
going
forward
and
the
spirit
of
the
soldier
in
him
made
him
restless
to
take
his
part
in
it
his
hand
was
upon
his
sword
when
suddenly
a
great
roar
of
voices
from
every
side
seemed
to
shake
the
square
again
and
again
it
rose
swelling
and
breaking
like
storm
waves
lashing
a
shore
there
was
quick
movement
round
the
statue
of
ferdinand
a
frantic
waving
of
arms
and
then
the
mighty
roar
became
articulate
maritza
maritza
she
had
come
among
them
a
warrior
even
as
her
fathers
were
it
was
fitting
that
her
name
should
resound
over
sturatzberg
charge
again
the
distant
command
again
the
fierce
cries
and
groaning
of
conflict
and
still
the
rebel
ranks
remained
unbroken
again
the
soldiers
were
beaten
down
and
driven
back
maritza
had
come
and
that
meant
victory
the
belief
was
deep
seated
in
the
heart
of
every
man
from
what
point
she
had
entered
the
square
ellerey
could
not
determine
but
in
a
few
moments
he
saw
her
she
was
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
statue
a
pathetic
yet
an
heroic
figure
she
was
still
in
her
dress
her
bright
curls
falling
loosely
from
under
her
cap
she
said
something
which
ellerey
could
not
hear
and
then
the
shouting
broke
out
again
men
ran
to
join
their
comrades
impatient
only
for
opportunity
to
strike
a
blow
at
the
foe
leaving
the
princess
in
the
midst
of
a
little
band
evidently
a
picked
bodyguard
among
them
baron
petrescu
and
dumitru
for
a
moment
ellerey
watched
her
she
had
come
there
was
no
sign
of
fear
in
her
face
how
should
there
be
did
he
not
know
her
courage
when
had
maritza
ever
failed
when
the
time
for
action
arrived
had
he
not
full
reason
to
know
what
a
splendid
comrade
she
was
in
a
tight
place
all
these
who
shouted
her
name
were
her
comrades
was
it
likely
she
would
desert
them
in
the
hour
of
their
need
and
this
was
the
woman
he
loved
the
woman
who
loved
him
yes
in
that
instant
all
doubt
seemed
to
fade
into
knowledge
almost
he
fancied
that
her
quick
glance
sought
him
in
that
striving
crowd
and
not
finding
that
disappointment
touched
her
heart
oh
it
was
good
to
be
loved
even
for
one
short
hour
by
such
a
woman
as
this
his
sword
was
naked
in
his
hand
as
he
went
swiftly
across
the
square
and
shouldered
his
way
to
her
desmond
ellerey
she
cried
a
wondrous
light
glowing
in
her
eyes
as
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
him
at
your
service
and
command
princess
he
answered
in
her
glad
cry
at
his
coming
he
heard
the
confession
of
her
love
he
read
it
in
her
eyes
yet
he
did
not
call
her
maritza
indeed
she
claimed
the
address
of
sovereignty
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
not
come
she
said
in
a
lower
voice
you
do
not
love
my
cause
i
stand
or
fall
for
it
princess
he
said
aloud
because
desmond
because
i
love
you
he
whispered
it
was
said
it
had
to
be
said
now
lest
she
should
never
know
for
this
day
was
a
day
of
battle
and
before
evening
ears
might
be
deaf
and
lips
silenced
forever
for
a
moment
longer
she
held
his
hand
in
hers
and
then
fearing
perhaps
that
others
about
her
might
see
some
preference
in
her
welcome
she
cried
aloud
ah
god
must
surely
destine
me
for
victory
he
has
given
me
so
many
brave
and
true
men
the
roar
of
conflict
was
not
confined
to
one
side
of
the
square
now
street
after
street
took
up
the
fight
the
soldiers
were
attacking
from
every
quarter
the
sharp
command
to
charge
rang
out
more
often
and
the
sudden
growl
of
the
struggles
was
fiercer
and
longer
and
more
continuous
here
and
there
was
an
ominous
bending
inward
of
a
mass
of
defenders
but
it
was
straightened
again
by
mere
force
of
numbers
they
want
more
men
there
said
ellerey
pointing
with
his
sword
to
one
place
maritza
gave
a
quick
order
to
a
man
near
her
and
immediately
other
men
were
hurrying
to
strengthen
the
position
who
commands
asked
ellerey
turning
to
the
baron
the
princess
was
the
answer
a
dozen
leaders
fight
for
me
said
maritza
but
i
look
to
you
and
the
baron
to
advise
me
what
forces
have
you
in
the
city
beside
these
ellerey
asked
turning
to
petrescu
many
are
hurrying
to
join
us
he
answered
and
will
have
to
fight
their
way
to
us
said
ellerey
we
must
hold
the
square
at
all
costs
for
i
see
no
line
of
retreat
retreat
exclaimed
maritza
there
is
no
retreat
for
me
makes
me
queen
in
wallaria
or
nothing
still
princess
a
momentary
retreat
might
save
the
day
we
have
no
way
of
retreat
captain
said
petrescu
and
the
look
in
his
face
told
ellerey
plainly
enough
that
loyal
as
he
was
he
had
little
hope
of
success
circumstances
have
forced
matters
to
an
issue
and
we
must
stand
or
fall
as
the
fates
decide
the
rattle
of
musketry
was
now
continuous
on
all
sides
and
for
those
who
fell
there
was
little
help
or
thought
friend
and
foe
alike
trampling
them
to
death
in
the
struggle
more
than
once
soldiers
thrust
forward
by
those
behind
them
had
broken
through
the
ranks
of
the
defenders
only
to
be
shot
or
stabbed
before
they
could
recover
themselves
again
the
rushes
were
stopped
and
repulsed
but
still
they
were
made
with
unabated
fury
and
ellerey
saw
that
each
one
was
more
determined
more
difficult
to
meet
than
the
last
constantly
that
ominous
bending
inward
was
only
straightened
with
great
effort
presently
he
touched
the
baron
on
the
shoulder
and
pointed
to
one
street
where
in
the
distance
mounted
men
could
be
seen
i
have
been
wondering
why
they
did
not
use
them
said
ellerey
the
streets
are
narrow
for
them
said
petrescu
true
but
if
only
a
dozen
break
through
there
will
be
confusion
and
then
lowering
his
voice
ellerey
went
on
is
there
no
way
of
escape
for
her
we
may
carve
one
for
her
ellerey
you
and
i
it
is
the
only
way
i
know
of
they
had
spoken
in
a
low
tone
but
had
their
voices
been
louder
it
is
doubtful
whether
maritza
would
have
heard
them
she
was
absorbed
in
watching
the
deadly
struggle
which
raged
around
her
she
was
unconscious
of
the
bells
above
her
which
told
quarter
after
quarter
sounding
musically
over
the
city
perhaps
the
thought
came
to
her
that
these
men
were
dying
in
her
cause
at
her
bidding
but
how
could
she
blame
herself
had
not
thousands
before
them
died
for
her
fathers
were
her
rights
less
than
those
of
her
fathers
and
was
she
not
among
her
subjects
to
cry
victory
with
them
or
to
die
in
their
midst
she
asked
from
them
no
sacrifice
which
she
herself
was
not
prepared
to
make
will
those
others
who
are
coming
never
fight
their
way
to
us
she
said
turning
to
ellerey
suddenly
if
they
can
princess
it
was
a
vain
hope
in
every
street
which
led
to
the
grande
place
there
had
been
desperate
struggles
in
the
roadways
lay
the
dead
and
dying
while
others
fled
to
find
safety
if
they
could
there
was
no
help
to
come
and
ellerey
did
not
expect
it
charge
the
command
rang
out
simultaneously
from
all
sides
and
there
was
the
jingle
of
harness
and
the
thud
of
horses
hoofs
here
the
attack
was
hurled
back
horses
riderless
here
horse
and
man
pitched
forward
to
be
shot
and
stabbed
and
here
the
same
and
here
but
yonder
the
defenders
had
been
driven
in
and
there
too
a
dozen
horsemen
were
in
the
square
and
although
they
fell
confusion
had
begun
the
defense
was
weakened
at
several
points
more
horsemen
fought
their
way
in
and
with
them
gained
an
entrance
step
by
step
the
rebels
were
driven
backward
toward
the
statue
where
maritza
stood
will
those
others
never
fight
their
way
to
us
she
cried
in
almost
piteous
tones
you
can
not
stay
here
said
ellerey
come
men
were
already
rushing
past
them
once
beaten
back
hopelessness
came
quickly
and
many
of
those
who
had
been
foremost
in
the
fight
now
shouted
to
their
comrades
to
escape
if
they
could
the
soldiers
resistlessly
pressing
forward
were
closing
in
on
them
when
ellerey
spoke
maritza
did
not
answer
come
he
said
again
his
hand
on
her
arm
the
touch
roused
her
i
have
brought
you
to
this
forgive
me
desmond
she
said
her
whole
ambition
was
forgotten
for
a
moment
in
the
thought
of
the
man
beside
her
ellerey
did
not
answer
there
was
no
time
the
soldiers
were
upon
them
with
petrescu
on
one
side
and
dumitru
on
the
other
ellerey
threw
himself
before
the
princess
the
final
struggle
had
commenced
and
so
fierce
was
the
resistance
of
these
three
men
that
the
soldiers
hesitated
and
fell
back
a
pace
fly
princess
while
there
is
time
ellerey
shouted
victory
or
death
i
stay
and
her
voice
rang
clear
above
the
uproar
with
you
desmond
the
last
words
were
spoken
almost
in
a
whisper
and
they
maddened
him
here
was
death
butchery
and
she
was
in
the
midst
of
it
maritza
go
dear
go
he
cried
let
me
hold
them
back
for
a
moment
i
will
follow
petrescu
dumitru
so
determined
was
the
struggle
round
the
steps
of
the
statue
that
the
tide
of
battle
seemed
to
have
turned
again
and
some
of
the
rebels
dashed
fiercely
back
into
the
fray
take
her
dumitru
ellerey
whispered
we
hold
them
while
we
can
suddenly
from
a
corner
of
the
grande
place
rushing
swiftly
through
the
ranks
of
the
flying
rebels
came
a
woman
are
you
cowards
or
men
she
cried
aloud
as
she
came
and
some
turned
at
that
cry
and
met
death
with
a
shout
of
defiance
while
others
stood
irresolute
until
fear
overcame
them
ellerey
saw
her
as
she
reached
maritza
side
and
then
he
was
conscious
that
a
stalwart
arm
was
raining
heavy
blows
upon
the
foes
which
seemed
to
surround
him
she
would
come
i
could
not
stay
her
said
stefan
between
his
deeply
panted
breaths
as
he
struck
again
and
again
fly
maritza
frina
you
fly
maritza
the
salvation
of
maritza
seemed
her
one
thought
the
hope
that
she
might
accomplish
it
even
at
the
last
moment
had
drawn
her
hither
how
it
was
to
be
done
she
had
not
asked
herself
yet
now
she
appeared
to
have
found
the
way
even
as
she
spoke
dumitru
seized
the
princess
come
he
said
as
he
threw
a
cloak
about
her
to
conceal
her
identity
we
fail
ah
it
was
a
short
sharp
cry
a
cry
with
finality
in
it
whatever
might
bring
forth
he
should
have
no
part
in
it
his
hand
still
grasped
the
cloak
as
he
fell
backwards
and
maritza
was
dragged
down
with
him
grigosie
said
ellerey
to
the
soldier
beside
him
as
he
saw
dumitru
fall
he
used
the
name
that
stefan
might
understand
to
the
full
was
there
anything
that
stefan
would
not
do
for
grigosie
frina
mavrodin
stood
for
a
moment
alone
above
the
surging
fighting
mass
she
had
shuddered
when
she
had
passed
the
dead
body
of
francois
in
the
passage
now
she
drew
herself
to
her
full
height
and
looked
down
upon
the
battle
she
stood
there
that
all
men
might
see
her
that
maritza
might
escape
and
then
she
saw
ellerey
with
the
sweat
and
grime
of
the
conflict
upon
him
for
an
instant
their
eyes
met
her
lips
whispered
his
name
and
then
she
threw
up
her
arms
and
with
a
low
cry
fell
prone
upon
the
steps
of
the
statue
maritza
who
was
bending
over
dumitru
turned
swiftly
and
made
one
step
towards
her
when
stefan
stopped
her
come
he
said
and
this
time
he
waited
for
no
pleading
drawing
the
cloak
tightly
round
her
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
in
the
midst
of
those
who
fled
rushed
from
the
square
the
plan
he
had
made
earlier
in
the
day
when
the
countess
walked
beside
him
he
would
carry
out
now
he
had
ears
for
no
entreaty
for
no
threat
we
win
through
grigosie
he
said
over
and
over
again
as
he
turned
now
into
one
alley
now
into
another
leaving
the
flying
rabble
further
and
further
behind
we
win
through
grigosie
it
the
captain
orders
ellerey
heard
that
cry
too
and
knew
its
meaning
there
was
a
shout
of
triumph
from
the
soldiers
pressing
forward
a
swaying
back
of
the
rebels
and
he
was
carried
along
with
them
unable
to
use
his
sword
in
the
seething
mass
of
friends
and
foes
she
is
dead
someone
cried
and
the
effect
was
instantaneous
men
took
up
the
cry
and
shouted
that
maritza
was
dead
and
the
soldiers
may
have
thought
it
was
so
seeing
a
woman
fall
every
rebel
was
at
once
struggling
to
fight
his
way
out
of
the
crowd
his
own
safety
his
only
thought
they
day
was
lost
it
was
the
time
to
seek
safety
if
it
were
to
be
found
the
baron
and
ellerey
were
still
side
by
side
and
together
they
were
forced
back
toward
a
narrow
street
there
is
still
a
chance
for
you
petrescu
whispered
and
the
next
moment
he
was
striving
madly
to
force
his
way
back
to
the
statue
to
the
side
of
the
woman
he
had
loved
then
he
was
cut
down
and
trampled
under
foot
as
ellerey
was
carried
away
in
a
rush
of
pursued
and
pursuers
suddenly
the
pressure
relaxed
the
open
street
was
before
him
ellerey
no
matter
who
else
escapes
seize
ellerey
he
had
been
recognized
and
for
him
there
was
no
hope
of
mercy
he
swung
round
one
sweeping
blow
of
his
sword
and
sprang
forward
the
way
seemed
clear
when
a
figure
suddenly
dashed
from
a
doorway
and
fired
at
him
point
blank
twice
in
quick
succession
crying
his
name
to
those
who
appeared
to
have
lost
him
for
a
moment
a
pain
like
the
running
in
of
a
skewer
was
in
ellerey
arm
but
not
his
sword
arm
and
the
weapon
flashed
high
in
the
air
and
fell
with
relentless
force
quits
you
devil
he
cried
as
de
froilette
reeled
backwards
cut
with
deadly
depth
downward
from
the
shoulder
then
ellerey
rushed
on
again
one
among
hundreds
seeking
safety
followed
by
their
conquerors
who
showed
no
mercy
suddenly
an
arm
was
outstretched
from
an
alley
and
seized
him
the
impetus
of
being
thus
turned
in
his
headlong
flight
carried
him
some
yards
down
the
narrow
way
quickly
said
a
voice
in
his
ear
to
the
right
now
to
the
left
a
guiding
hand
and
a
supporting
arm
urged
him
forward
ellerey
asked
no
question
never
turned
toward
the
man
who
ran
beside
him
but
went
on
mechanically
his
brain
was
full
of
a
whirling
nightmare
then
a
door
was
slammed
heavily
there
was
the
sensation
of
rapid
movement
the
quick
beating
of
galloping
horses
and
then
faintness
and
oblivion
the
red
sun
sank
westward
glowing
on
the
roofs
and
spires
of
the
city
the
minutes
passed
swiftly
and
the
hours
still
in
the
smaller
streets
and
the
narrow
alleys
there
were
flying
feet
and
now
and
again
a
shriek
as
some
poor
wretch
pitched
forward
shot
or
stabbed
by
his
relentless
pursuers
resistance
there
was
none
that
was
over
the
dead
and
dying
lay
in
the
roadways
where
they
had
fallen
the
only
cry
now
was
for
mercy
and
that
was
seldom
granted
the
soldiers
were
savage
too
and
rebellion
must
be
stamped
out
by
the
statue
of
ferdinand
a
squad
of
soldiers
was
halted
and
on
the
steps
just
as
she
had
fallen
lay
frina
mavrodin
she
was
beautiful
in
death
and
there
was
a
pathos
in
that
prostrate
form
which
appealed
even
to
these
rough
soldiers
had
she
not
been
the
lady
bountiful
in
that
city
they
were
silent
for
the
most
part
or
if
they
spoke
hushed
their
voices
to
a
whisper
and
used
no
oaths
she
had
sacrificed
her
life
for
the
man
and
woman
she
loved
here
in
the
grande
place
of
sturatzberg
where
a
little
while
since
fierce
conflict
raged
here
where
maritza
cause
had
been
fought
for
and
lost
here
where
so
many
turned
sightless
eyes
to
the
deepening
sky
frina
mavrodin
had
found
her
rest
no
tramping
struggling
feet
had
touched
her
and
only
the
blood
staining
the
brown
hair
where
the
bullet
had
struck
showed
that
this
was
death
and
not
sleep
the
minutes
passed
and
the
hours
the
bells
sounding
musically
at
short
intervals
over
the
city
and
the
sun
slowly
sank
lower
and
lower
into
his
bed
of
purple
and
red
and
gold
chapter
xxviii
the
diplomacy
of
lord
cloverton
desmond
ellerey
recovered
consciousness
slowly
and
gradually
after
the
sensations
of
movement
and
galloping
horses
there
was
utter
oblivion
for
a
time
followed
by
sharp
pain
which
seemed
to
be
caused
by
someone
bending
over
him
a
shadowy
figure
whose
attack
upon
him
he
was
powerless
to
resist
then
he
heard
voices
and
more
than
one
shadow
flitted
vaguely
across
his
vision
presently
he
realized
that
he
was
stretched
out
at
full
length
and
that
he
was
in
a
room
which
had
an
intricate
pattern
on
the
ceiling
the
lines
and
curves
of
which
his
eyes
were
trying
to
follow
well
doctor
nothing
serious
was
the
answer
a
bullet
has
torn
the
fleshy
part
of
the
arm
but
it
would
hardly
account
for
his
collapse
the
man
is
thoroughly
played
out
and
has
had
no
sleep
for
some
nights
probably
and
has
been
at
high
tension
for
a
long
time
but
will
he
be
able
to
travel
he
would
be
better
for
hours
sleep
first
that
is
out
of
the
question
was
the
answer
is
it
a
long
journey
asked
the
doctor
yes
but
he
will
be
well
cared
for
and
will
have
nothing
to
do
it
will
pull
him
down
a
bit
but
he
will
stand
it
all
right
the
doctor
returned
his
is
the
sort
of
constitution
which
stands
anything
at
first
ellerey
had
only
been
conscious
of
voices
now
he
partly
understood
what
was
said
and
half
raised
himself
where
am
i
he
asked
faintly
ah
that
better
said
the
doctor
drink
this
it
will
start
you
toward
recovery
no
leave
that
arm
alone
it
will
be
all
right
presently
it
hurts
a
bit
ellerey
answered
i
remember
de
froilette
did
it
i
think
i
struck
him
down
i
forget
what
happened
after
that
and
he
drank
from
the
glass
handed
him
well
goldberg
he
looks
better
already
said
the
other
man
coming
forward
and
standing
by
the
couch
do
you
know
me
ellerey
lord
cloverton
i
told
you
i
would
pluck
you
from
under
the
wheels
of
car
if
i
could
and
so
far
i
have
succeeded
i
do
know
how
you
have
done
it
but
i
thank
you
i
will
leave
you
for
a
little
while
said
goldberg
how
long
before
he
starts
delay
it
as
long
as
you
can
a
couple
of
hours
said
cloverton
very
well
i
will
come
in
and
see
him
comfortably
packed
up
i
can
not
go
said
ellerey
as
the
door
closed
upon
the
doctor
listen
to
me
said
the
ambassador
sitting
down
on
the
end
of
the
couch
i
am
not
going
to
criticize
your
actions
and
that
you
are
here
in
the
embassy
proves
that
i
still
feel
some
interest
in
you
i
hardly
expected
to
save
you
but
captain
ward
was
fortunate
in
choosing
the
right
spot
to
rescue
you
and
he
managed
to
get
you
here
without
anyone
knowing
you
are
still
being
eagerly
sought
for
i
should
like
to
thank
captain
ward
said
ellerey
you
shall
before
you
go
i
can
not
leave
sturatzberg
said
ellerey
you
can
understand
that
under
the
circumstances
i
have
run
some
risk
in
having
you
brought
to
the
embassy
lord
cloverton
went
on
it
is
quite
impossible
for
you
to
remain
here
and
to
go
into
the
streets
of
the
city
would
be
to
go
to
your
death
still
i
must
go
lord
cloverton
you
do
not
understand
perhaps
not
but
i
have
myself
to
think
of
as
well
as
you
for
both
of
us
it
is
necessary
that
you
cross
the
frontier
as
soon
as
possible
in
two
hours
we
start
i
am
going
as
far
as
breslen
on
my
own
affairs
and
in
case
of
accident
an
escort
is
to
accompany
my
carriage
which
will
be
closed
i
have
made
the
most
of
the
dangers
to
myself
and
have
demanded
that
my
person
shall
be
well
guarded
you
will
go
with
me
and
for
your
journey
from
breslen
i
have
made
further
arrangements
you
are
unlikely
to
be
stopped
but
my
lord
you
owe
no
further
allegiance
to
the
cause
you
have
striven
for
you
can
depart
in
all
honor
the
cause
is
annihilated
i
know
my
lord
i
know
still
i
can
not
leave
sturatzberg
somehow
i
expected
to
find
you
difficult
to
persuade
said
lord
cloverton
rising
i
have
no
time
to
argue
with
you
i
will
send
someone
else
to
do
that
i
hope
to
find
you
more
tractable
when
i
return
he
went
out
of
the
room
closing
the
door
gently
behind
him
ellerey
raised
himself
on
the
couch
wincing
with
the
pain
his
arm
gave
him
but
determined
to
balk
the
ambassador
while
he
had
the
opportunity
it
was
evident
that
if
he
remained
there
lord
cloverton
would
force
him
to
this
journey
and
he
was
too
weak
to
offer
any
real
resistance
but
once
in
the
streets
he
could
hide
and
wait
and
seek
maritza
in
every
corner
of
the
city
until
the
door
opened
again
and
closed
ellerey
back
was
toward
it
and
he
did
not
turn
it
was
only
a
servant
probably
who
would
go
away
presently
desmond
a
few
hurried
steps
the
quick
rustle
of
a
dress
and
then
a
figure
was
kneeling
by
the
couch
and
a
head
was
pillowed
on
his
breast
desmond
for
a
moment
he
did
not
speak
he
could
not
his
confusion
returned
and
seemed
to
overwhelm
him
surely
he
was
still
dreaming
maritza
you
is
it
really
you
how
wonderful
it
is
this
waking
is
it
you
maritza
yes
dear
thank
god
for
bringing
you
to
me
again
it
is
wonderful
ellerey
murmured
red
blood
is
before
my
eyes
still
and
in
my
ears
shouting
and
groaning
we
have
lived
through
it
all
you
and
i
and
so
many
are
dead
desmond
have
died
for
me
my
heart
is
heavy
and
full
of
tears
only
only
there
is
you
and
you
are
here
and
god
forgive
me
there
is
joy
in
my
soul
because
of
this
it
was
a
strange
new
thing
for
him
to
see
maritza
weep
and
frina
frina
gave
her
life
for
mine
desmond
she
whispered
he
did
not
speak
but
his
fingers
closed
over
hers
and
they
were
both
silent
they
are
looking
for
us
in
every
corner
of
the
city
she
said
presently
how
did
you
escape
he
asked
i
hardly
know
stefan
caught
me
up
and
ran
with
me
i
strove
to
free
myself
in
vain
i
pleaded
i
threatened
but
it
was
of
no
use
i
was
a
child
in
those
great
arms
of
his
he
brought
me
here
lord
cloverton
was
very
kind
where
is
stefan
now
here
still
he
is
going
with
us
lord
cloverton
says
that
you
will
not
go
but
you
will
desmond
wo
you
i
want
you
to
take
me
away
anywhere
desmond
anywhere
away
from
sturatzberg
i
would
not
go
my
darling
because
you
were
not
with
me
when
you
came
in
i
was
making
up
my
mind
to
drop
from
the
window
that
i
might
look
for
you
but
now
my
poor
love
you
are
weak
how
could
you
my
sword
arm
is
whole
still
though
it
is
tired
very
tired
it
shall
rest
now
she
said
taking
it
and
pressing
it
to
her
breast
desmond
yes
dearest
only
once
have
you
said
to
me
love
you
never
yet
have
i
been
in
your
arms
put
this
strong
one
round
me
now
say
love
you
tell
me
oh
how
often
have
i
longed
to
hear
those
words
from
your
lips
i
love
you
maritza
my
princess
he
whispered
and
he
kissed
her
lips
as
a
little
contented
sigh
escaped
them
how
beautiful
you
are
he
went
on
after
a
moment
pause
it
is
strange
maritza
but
since
that
morning
on
the
downs
i
have
never
seen
you
dressed
as
a
woman
once
desmond
ah
then
you
wore
a
mask
and
looked
through
it
with
eyes
of
love
desmond
even
then
yes
even
then
these
are
borrowed
clothes
lord
cloverton
persuaded
someone
to
lend
them
he
was
nervous
until
i
became
a
woman
grigosie
is
dead
desmond
is
there
no
regret
in
your
heart
none
she
answered
you
lose
a
kingdom
maritza
it
is
well
lost
for
love
desmond
i
have
found
my
king
she
was
kneeling
beside
the
couch
when
lord
cloverton
entered
well
captain
ellerey
are
you
ready
to
go
how
can
i
thank
you
my
lord
by
going
the
ambassador
answered
with
a
smile
sight
of
the
princess
is
evidently
good
medicine
for
you
you
have
both
given
me
many
anxious
hours
you
must
forgive
us
said
maritza
princess
i
am
an
old
man
i
envy
my
countryman
his
youth
but
for
all
that
i
shall
find
my
work
in
sturatzberg
easier
when

rebels

ellerey
grasping
the
latter
hand

but
repaying
the
debt
i
incurred
on
the
night
of
the
duel
captain
ellerey
the
carriage

lord
cloverton

in
the
inner
courtyard

doctor
wrap
up
your
patient
and
help

helped
and
stefan
asked
ellerey

with
us
he
is
waiting
come
the
travelling
carriage
was
large
and
roomy
and
they
entered
it
in
silence
in
the
inner
courtyard
stefan
was
waiting
and
saluted
ellerey
but
neither
of
them
spoke
then
the
windows
were
drawn
up
the
blinds
closed
and
then
they
moved
out
there
was
a
sharp
word
of
command
as
they
passed
into
the
street
and
so
escorted
by
the
king
troops
the
man
and
woman
who
were
being
searched
for
in
every
corner
of
the
city
passed
out
by
the
northern
gate
and
through
the
bois
and
were
presently
driving
along
the
breslen
road
lord
cloverton
arrangements
had
been
very
carefully
and
completely
made
in
breslen
the
carriage
drove
into
an
inn
yard
the
escort
remaining
without
and
in
the
yard
another
carriage
was
waiting
the
driver
was
in
possession
of
the
papers
necessary
for
the
journey
and
unless
something
unforeseen
should
happen
nothing
could
prevent
the
fugitives
reaching
the
frontier
in
safety
wait
until
i
have
gone
said
lord
cloverton
and
then
start
he
whispered
as
he
raised
maritza
hand
to
his
lips
i
hope
we
shall
meet
again
under
happier
circumstances
in
england
it
may
be
your
marriage
will
render
a
very
charming
princess
powerless
to
disturb
the
peace
of
europe
thank
you
a
thousand
times
said
ellerey
you
have
given
me
more
than
life
happiness
when
the
ambassador

to
stefan
what

i
say
to
you
old
comrade

ellerey

my
hand

other
things
beside
soldiering

stay
with
us
stefan
said
maritza
i
do
think
i
could
have
known
any
real
woman
before
the
soldier
muttered
ten
minutes
later
they
had
passed
out
of
the
inn
yard
and
were
galloping
toward
the
frontier
and
in
the
midst
of
his
escort
lord
cloverton
was
riding
back
to
sturatzberg
so
far
he
had
succeeded
but
he
knew
how
often
some
little
thing
destroyed
the
scheme
he
drove
direct
to
the
palace
and
was
admitted
to
the
king
queen
elena
was
with
him
do
you
bring
us
news
of
this
countryman
of
yours
my
lord
said
the
king
and
he
spoke
somewhat
curtly
or
of
princess
maritza
said
the
queen
it
is
very
strange
that
neither
of
them
can
be
found
so
they
have
not
been
found
yet
said
the
ambassador
no
my
lord
but
they
will
be
i
have
it
on
good
authority
only
a
moment
ago
that
they
are
even
now
between
breslen
and
the
frontier
it
was
cleverly
conceived
lord
cloverton
but
it
is
not
too
late
to
stop
them
and
the
king
hand
was
raised
to
strike
a
gong
to
summon
a
messenger
one
moment
your
majesty
why
delay
exclaimed
the
queen
impatiently
every
moment
is
of
value
five
minutes
have
slipped
away
already
since
this
news
was
brought
to
you
telegraph
to
the
frontier
at
once
i
shall
not
rest
until
maritza
is
taken
and
de
froilette
your
majesty
said
the
ambassador
quietly
he
is
dead
i
know
was
the
answer
had
he
been
alive
he
too
would
have
been
hurrying
toward
the
frontier
your
majesty
should
rejoice
in
his
death
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
trusted
my
lord
you
tell
us
only
what
we
know
said
the
queen
a
little
more
i
think
your
majesty
was
the
quiet
answer
a
servant
of
mine
saw
monsieur
de
froilette
struck
down
by
captain
ellerey
and
knowing
the
man
searched
him
he
carried
much
that
was
incriminating
upon
him
and
then
turning
to
the
king
he
added
would
it
not
be
well
to
let
captain
ellerey
and
the
princess
go
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
king
angrily
lord
cloverton
only
seeks
to
delay
that
message
said
the
queen
send
it
some
of
your
enemies
are
dead
but
these
two
escape
and
must
be
allowed
to
escape
said
the
ambassador
do
you
threaten
my
lord
said
the
king
i
ask
the
queen
to
support
me
with
regard
to
these
fugitives
and
i
refuse
she
answered
send
the
message
will
your
majesty
show
the
king
the
bracelet
of
medallions
said
lord
cloverton
the
king
rose
angrily
once
before
my
lord
and
then
he
stopped
send
the
message
cried
the
queen
and
then
look
to
your
own
safety
said
lord
cloverton
turning
sharply
to
the
king
russia
has
plotted
against
you
her
troops
lie
still
on
the
frontier
and
treachery
has
been
beside
you
by
a
strange
chance
the
plot
miscarried
but
it
was
near
to
success
this
was
found
in
jules
de
froilette
possession
and
he
held
up
the
bracelet
the
king
looked
at
it
the
queen
drew
in
her
breath
sharply
and
bit
her
lip
until
the
blood
came
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
said
the
king
turning
to
her
after
a
pause
at
a
fitting
time
i
will
answer
she
said
the
king
sat
down
heavily
in
his
chair
i
will
send
no
message
he
said
lord
cloverton
bowed
and
placing
the
bracelet
carefully
on
the
table
silently
left
the
apartment
chapter
xxix
after
war
peace
peaceful
times
had
fallen
upon
wallaria
it
is
whispered
sometimes
that
the
relations
between
the
king
and
the
queen
are
not
of
the
happiest
but
who
that
would
publish
such
a
statement
can
possibly
know
the
truth
with
any
certainty
it
is
a
fact
that
the
country
is
better
governed
at
nights
the
streets
of
sturatzberg
are
far
safer
than
they
were
formerly
and
the
brigands
in
the
hills
have
been
dispersed
some
political
malcontents
among
them
have
been
banished
but
many
have
been
pardoned
and
go
in
and
out
of
the
city
unmolested
the
court
is
still
a
brilliant
one
but
in
these
days
there
is
no
woman
there
as
beautiful
as
frina
mavrodin
and
lord
cloverton
is
no
longer
british
ambassador
he
has
been
transferred
to
paris
and
this
fact
alone
is
sufficient
to
show
that
the
powers
are
more
agreed
concerning
wallaria
a
less
experienced
man
than
lord
cloverton
is
now
at
the
embassy
and
has
had
no
such
troublous
times
to
steer
through
as
fell
to
his
predecessor
yet
princess
maritza
is
not
forgotten
in
sturatzberg
and
for
a
small
bribe
many
a
man
will
tell
the
traveler
her
romantic
history
and
will
perhaps
whisper
in
his
ear
as
though
the
spirit
of
revolution
were
not
altogether
dead
in
him
i
was
among
those
who
fought
that
day
in
the
grande
place
so
long
as
they
live
desmond
ellerey
and
his
wife
will
not
forget
that
day
but
they
seldom
speak
of
it
it
is
quite
certain
that
maritza
has
never
regretted
the
kingdom
she
lost
love
has
crowned
her
life
and
she
is
satisfied
long
since
has
it
been
known
that
the
story
which
drove
ellerey
away
from
his
country
was
a
lie
told
and
substantiated
by
the
real
culprit
to
shield
himself
by
this
man
tardy
confession
ellerey
character
was
cleared
and
many
expected
him
to
return
to
england
at
once
but
he
did
not
do
so
when
his
brother
died
and
he
became
sir
desmond
ellerey
he
did
return
for
a
while
however
staying
for
some
time
with
his
old
and
staunch
friends
sir
charles
and
lady
martin
and
his
beautiful
wife
caused
a
sensation
she
visited
her
old
school
and
she
stood
with
her
husband
upon
the
downs
on
the
very
spot
where
they
had
first
met
but
england
was
not
for
them
they
decided
and
their
permanent
home
is
in
italy
in
sight
of
dancing
blue
waters
and
under
a
blue
sky
and
in
this
italian
home
is
stefan
whose
chief
duty
seems
to
consist
in
worshipping
ellerey
small
son
who
is
going
to
be
a
soldier
when
he
grows
up
and
win
a
wife
like
his
mother
just
as
his
father
did
it
is
stefan
who
tells
him
stories
of
the
past
stefan
who
fashions
wooden
swords
for
him
and
who
would
willingly
lay
down
his
life
for
his
father
mother
or
son
once
i
did
care
for
anybody
stefan
said
to
the
lad
one
day
you
did
know
father
then
no
and
for
a
long
time
after
that
i
hated
women
until
you
met
my
mother
asked
the
boy
yes
and
until
i
knew
grigosie
grigosie
who
was
grigosie
she
was
a
princess
my
mother
is
a
princess
father
says
so
and
some
day
when
you
are
old
enough
he
will
tell
you
all
about
grigosie
too
and
how
it
is
you
are
not
a
king
mother
sometimes
calls
me
her
little
king
said
the
boy
i
do
wonder
now
it
time
to
mount
and
charge
home
so
the
little
warrior
is
quickly
lifted
on
stefan
shoulder
and
with
waving
wooden
sword
and
with
curls
flying
is
whirled
off
on
his
willing
charger
