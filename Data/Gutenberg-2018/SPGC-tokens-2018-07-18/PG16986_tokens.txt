the
praise
be
to
god
who
hath
made
being
to
come
forth
from
nothingness
graven
upon
the
tablet
of
man
the
secrets
of
preexistence
taught
him
from
the
mysteries
of
divine
utterance
that
which
he
knew
not
made
him
a
luminous
book
unto
those
who
believed
and
surrendered
themselves
caused
him
to
witness
the
creation
of
all
things
kullu
shay
in
this
black
and
ruinous
age
and
to
speak
forth
from
the
apex
of
eternity
with
a
wondrous
voice
in
the
excellent
temple
to
the
end
that
every
man
may
testify
in
himself
by
himself
in
the
station
of
the
manifestation
of
his
lord
that
verily
there
is
no
god
save
him
and
that
every
man
may
thereby
win
his
way
to
the
summit
of
realities
until
none
shall
contemplate
anything
whatsoever
but
that
he
shall
see
god
therein
and
i
praise
and
glorify
the
first
sea
which
hath
branched
from
the
ocean
of
the
divine
essence
and
the
first
morn
which
hath
glowed
from
the
horizon
of
oneness
and
the
first
sun
which
hath
risen
in
the
heaven
of
eternity
and
the
first
fire
which
was
lit
from
the
lamp
of
preexistence
in
the
lantern
of
singleness
he
who
was
aḥmad
in
the
kingdom
of
the
exalted
ones
and
muḥammad
amongst
the
concourse
of
the
near
ones
and
maḥmúd
in
the
realm
of
the
sincere
ones
by
whichsoever
name
ye
will
invoke
him
he
hath
most
excellent
names
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
know
and
upon
his
household
and
companions
be
abundant
and
abiding
and
eternal
peace
further
we
have
harkened
to
what
the
nightingale
of
knowledge
sang
on
the
boughs
of
the
tree
of
thy
being
and
learned
what
the
dove
of
certitude
cried
on
the
branches
of
the
bower
of
thy
heart
methinks
i
verily
inhaled
the
pure
fragrances
of
the
garment
of
thy
love
and
attained
thy
very
meeting
from
perusing
thy
letter
and
since
i
noted
thy
mention
of
thy
death
in
god
and
thy
life
through
him
and
thy
love
for
the
beloved
of
god
and
the
manifestations
of
his
names
and
the
of
his
therefore
reveal
unto
thee
sacred
and
resplendent
tokens
from
the
planes
of
glory
to
attract
thee
into
the
court
of
holiness
and
nearness
and
beauty
and
draw
thee
to
a
station
wherein
thou
shalt
see
nothing
in
creation
save
the
face
of
thy
beloved
one
the
honored
and
behold
all
created
things
only
as
in
the
day
wherein
none
hath
a
mention
of
this
hath
the
nightingale
of
oneness
sung
in
the
garden
of
ghawthíyyih
he
saith
and
there
shall
appear
upon
the
tablet
of
thine
heart
a
writing
of
the
subtle
mysteries
of
fear
god
and
god
will
give
you
knowledge
and
the
bird
of
thy
soul
shall
recall
the
holy
sanctuaries
of
preexistence
and
soar
on
the
wings
of
longing
in
the
heaven
of
walk
the
beaten
paths
of
thy
lord
and
gather
the
fruits
of
communion
in
the
gardens
of
then
feed
on
every
kind
of
by
my
life
o
friend
wert
thou
to
taste
of
these
fruits
from
the
green
garden
of
these
blossoms
which
grow
in
the
lands
of
knowledge
beside
the
orient
lights
of
the
essence
in
the
mirrors
of
names
and
would
seize
the
reins
of
patience
and
reserve
from
out
thy
hand
and
make
thy
soul
to
shake
with
the
flashing
light
and
draw
thee
from
the
earthly
homeland
to
the
first
heavenly
abode
in
the
center
of
realities
and
lift
thee
to
a
plane
wherein
thou
wouldst
soar
in
the
air
even
as
thou
walkest
upon
the
earth
and
move
over
the
water
as
thou
runnest
on
the
land
wherefore
may
it
rejoice
me
and
thee
and
whosoever
mounteth
into
the
heaven
of
knowledge
and
whose
heart
is
refreshed
by
this
that
the
wind
of
certitude
hath
blown
over
the
garden
of
his
being
from
the
sheba
of
the
peace
be
upon
him
who
followeth
the
right
path
and
further
the
stages
that
mark
the
wayfarer
s
journey
from
the
abode
of
dust
to
the
heavenly
homeland
are
said
to
be
seven
some
have
called
these
seven
valleys
and
others
seven
cities
and
they
say
that
until
the
wayfarer
taketh
leave
of
self
and
traverseth
these
stages
he
shall
never
reach
to
the
ocean
of
nearness
and
union
nor
drink
of
the
peerless
wine
the
first
is
the
valley
of
search
the
steed
of
this
valley
is
patience
without
patience
the
wayfarer
on
this
journey
will
reach
nowhere
and
attain
no
goal
nor
should
he
ever
be
downhearted
if
he
strive
for
a
hundred
thousand
years
and
yet
fail
to
behold
the
beauty
of
the
friend
he
should
not
falter
for
those
who
seek
the
ka
bih
of
for
us
rejoice
in
the
tidings
in
our
ways
will
we
guide
in
their
search
they
have
stoutly
girded
up
the
loins
of
service
and
seek
at
every
moment
to
journey
from
the
plane
of
heedlessness
into
the
realm
of
being
no
bond
shall
hold
them
back
and
no
counsel
shall
deter
them
it
is
incumbent
on
these
servants
that
they
cleanse
the
is
the
wellspring
of
divine
every
marking
and
that
they
turn
away
from
imitation
which
is
following
the
traces
of
their
forefathers
and
sires
and
shut
the
door
of
friendliness
and
enmity
upon
all
the
people
of
the
earth
in
this
journey
the
seeker
reacheth
a
stage
wherein
he
seeth
all
created
things
wandering
distracted
in
search
of
the
friend
how
many
a
jacob
will
he
see
hunting
after
his
joseph
he
will
behold
many
a
lover
hasting
to
seek
the
beloved
he
will
witness
a
world
of
desiring
ones
searching
after
the
one
desired
at
every
moment
he
findeth
a
weighty
matter
in
every
hour
he
becometh
aware
of
a
mystery
for
he
hath
taken
his
heart
away
from
both
worlds
and
set
out
for
the
ka
bih
of
the
beloved
at
every
step
aid
from
the
invisible
realm
will
attend
him
and
the
heat
of
his
search
will
grow
one
must
judge
of
search
by
the
standard
of
the
majnún
of
love
it
is
related
that
one
day
they
came
upon
majnún
sifting
the
dust
and
his
tears
flowing
down
they
said
what
doest
thou
he
said
i
seek
for
they
cried
alas
for
thee
laylí
is
of
pure
spirit
and
thou
seekest
her
in
the
dust
he
said
i
seek
her
everywhere
haply
somewhere
i
shall
find
yea
although
to
the
wise
it
be
shameful
to
seek
the
lord
of
lords
in
the
dust
yet
this
betokeneth
intense
ardor
in
searching
whoso
seeketh
out
a
thing
with
zeal
shall
find
the
true
seeker
hunteth
naught
but
the
object
of
his
quest
and
the
lover
hath
no
desire
save
union
with
his
beloved
nor
shall
the
seeker
reach
his
goal
unless
he
sacrifice
all
things
that
is
whatever
he
hath
seen
and
heard
and
understood
all
must
he
set
at
naught
that
he
may
enter
the
realm
of
the
spirit
which
is
the
city
of
god
labor
is
needed
if
we
are
to
seek
him
ardor
is
needed
if
we
are
to
drink
of
the
honey
of
reunion
with
him
and
if
we
taste
of
this
cup
we
shall
cast
away
the
world
on
this
journey
the
traveler
abideth
in
every
land
and
dwelleth
in
every
region
in
every
face
he
seeketh
the
beauty
of
the
friend
in
every
country
he
looketh
for
the
beloved
he
joineth
every
company
and
seeketh
fellowship
with
every
soul
that
haply
in
some
mind
he
may
uncover
the
secret
of
the
friend
or
in
some
face
he
may
behold
the
beauty
of
the
loved
one
and
if
by
the
help
of
god
he
findeth
on
this
journey
a
trace
of
the
traceless
friend
and
inhaleth
the
fragrance
of
the
joseph
from
the
heavenly
messenger
he
shall
straightway
step
into
the
valley
of
love
and
be
dissolved
in
the
fire
of
love
in
this
city
the
heaven
of
ecstasy
is
upraised
and
the
sun
of
yearning
shineth
and
the
fire
of
love
is
ablaze
and
when
the
fire
of
love
is
ablaze
it
burneth
to
ashes
the
harvest
of
reason
now
is
the
traveler
unaware
of
himself
and
of
aught
besides
himself
he
seeth
neither
ignorance
nor
knowledge
neither
doubt
nor
certitude
he
knoweth
not
the
morn
of
guidance
from
the
night
of
error
he
fleeth
both
from
unbelief
and
faith
and
deadly
poison
is
a
balm
to
him
wherefore
attár
saith
for
the
infidel
the
faithful
faith
for
attár
s
heart
an
atom
of
thy
pain
the
steed
of
this
valley
is
pain
and
if
there
be
no
pain
this
journey
will
never
end
in
this
station
the
lover
hath
no
thought
save
the
beloved
and
seeketh
no
refuge
save
the
friend
at
every
moment
he
offereth
a
hundred
lives
in
the
path
of
the
loved
one
at
every
step
he
throweth
a
thousand
heads
at
the
feet
of
the
beloved
o
my
brother
until
thou
enter
the
egypt
of
love
thou
shalt
never
come
to
the
joseph
of
the
beauty
of
the
friend
and
until
like
jacob
thou
forsake
thine
outward
eyes
thou
shalt
never
open
the
eye
of
thine
inward
being
and
until
thou
burn
with
the
fire
of
love
thou
shalt
never
commune
with
the
lover
of
longing
a
lover
feareth
nothing
and
no
harm
can
come
nigh
him
thou
seest
him
chill
in
the
fire
and
dry
in
the
sea
a
lover
is
he
who
is
chill
in
hell
fire
a
knower
is
he
who
is
dry
in
the
sea
love
accepteth
no
existence
and
wisheth
no
life
he
seeth
life
in
death
and
in
shame
seeketh
glory
to
merit
the
madness
of
love
man
must
abound
in
sanity
to
merit
the
bonds
of
the
friend
he
must
be
full
of
spirit
blessed
the
neck
that
is
caught
in
his
noose
happy
the
head
that
falleth
on
the
dust
in
the
pathway
of
his
love
wherefore
o
friend
give
up
thy
self
that
thou
mayest
find
the
peerless
one
pass
by
this
mortal
earth
that
thou
mayest
seek
a
home
in
the
nest
of
heaven
be
as
naught
if
thou
wouldst
kindle
the
fire
of
being
and
be
fit
for
the
pathway
of
love
love
seizeth
not
upon
a
living
soul
the
falcon
preyeth
not
on
a
dead
mouse
love
setteth
a
world
aflame
at
every
turn
and
he
wasteth
every
land
where
he
carrieth
his
banner
being
hath
no
existence
in
his
kingdom
the
wise
wield
no
command
within
his
realm
the
leviathan
of
love
swalloweth
the
master
of
reason
and
destroyeth
the
lord
of
knowledge
he
drinketh
the
seven
seas
but
his
heart
s
thirst
is
still
unquenched
and
he
saith
is
there
yet
any
more
he
shunneth
himself
and
draweth
away
from
all
on
earth
love
s
a
stranger
to
earth
and
heaven
too
in
him
are
lunacies
he
hath
bound
a
myriad
victims
in
his
fetters
wounded
a
myriad
wise
men
with
his
arrow
know
that
every
redness
in
the
world
is
from
his
anger
and
every
paleness
in
men
s
cheeks
is
from
his
poison
he
yieldeth
no
remedy
but
death
he
walketh
not
save
in
the
valley
of
the
shadow
yet
sweeter
than
honey
is
his
venom
on
the
lover
s
lips
and
fairer
his
destruction
in
the
seeker
s
eyes
than
a
hundred
thousand
lives
wherefore
must
the
veils
of
the
satanic
self
be
burned
away
at
the
fire
of
love
that
the
spirit
may
be
purified
and
cleansed
and
thus
may
know
the
station
of
the
lord
of
the
worlds
kindle
the
fire
of
love
and
burn
away
all
things
then
set
thy
foot
into
the
land
of
the
lovers
and
if
confirmed
by
the
creator
the
lover
escapes
from
the
claws
of
the
eagle
of
love
he
will
enter
the
valley
of
knowledge
and
come
out
of
doubt
into
certitude
and
turn
from
the
darkness
of
illusion
to
the
guiding
light
of
the
fear
of
god
his
inner
eyes
will
open
and
he
will
privily
converse
with
his
beloved
he
will
set
ajar
the
gate
of
truth
and
piety
and
shut
the
doors
of
vain
imaginings
he
in
this
station
is
content
with
the
decree
of
god
and
seeth
war
as
peace
and
findeth
in
death
the
secrets
of
everlasting
life
with
inward
and
outward
eyes
he
witnesseth
the
mysteries
of
resurrection
in
the
realms
of
creation
and
the
souls
of
men
and
with
a
pure
heart
apprehendeth
the
divine
wisdom
in
the
endless
manifestations
of
god
in
the
ocean
he
findeth
a
drop
in
a
drop
he
beholdeth
the
secrets
of
the
sea
split
the
atom
s
heart
and
lo
within
it
thou
wilt
find
a
sun
the
wayfarer
in
this
valley
seeth
in
the
fashionings
of
the
true
one
nothing
save
clear
providence
and
at
every
moment
saith
no
defect
canst
thou
see
in
the
creation
of
the
god
of
mercy
repeat
the
gaze
seest
thou
a
single
flaw
he
beholdeth
justice
in
injustice
and
in
justice
grace
in
ignorance
he
findeth
many
a
knowledge
hidden
and
in
knowledge
a
myriad
wisdoms
manifest
he
breaketh
the
cage
of
the
body
and
the
passions
and
consorteth
with
the
people
of
the
immortal
realm
he
mounteth
on
the
ladders
of
inner
truth
and
hasteneth
to
the
heaven
of
inner
significance
he
rideth
in
the
ark
of
we
shall
show
them
our
signs
in
the
regions
and
in
themselves
and
journeyeth
over
the
sea
of
until
it
become
plain
to
them
that
this
book
is
the
and
if
he
meeteth
with
injustice
he
shall
have
patience
and
if
he
cometh
upon
wrath
he
shall
manifest
love
there
was
once
a
lover
who
had
sighed
for
long
years
in
separation
from
his
beloved
and
wasted
in
the
fire
of
remoteness
from
the
rule
of
love
his
heart
was
empty
of
patience
and
his
body
weary
of
his
spirit
he
reckoned
life
without
her
as
a
mockery
and
time
consumed
him
away
how
many
a
day
he
found
no
rest
in
longing
for
her
how
many
a
night
the
pain
of
her
kept
him
from
sleep
his
body
was
worn
to
a
sigh
his
heart
s
wound
had
turned
him
to
a
cry
of
sorrow
he
had
given
a
thousand
lives
for
one
taste
of
the
cup
of
her
presence
but
it
availed
him
not
the
doctors
knew
no
cure
for
him
and
companions
avoided
his
company
yea
physicians
have
no
medicine
for
one
sick
of
love
unless
the
favor
of
the
beloved
one
deliver
him
at
last
the
tree
of
his
longing
yielded
the
fruit
of
despair
and
the
fire
of
his
hope
fell
to
ashes
then
one
night
he
could
live
no
more
and
he
went
out
of
his
house
and
made
for
the
marketplace
on
a
sudden
a
watchman
followed
after
him
he
broke
into
a
run
with
the
watchman
following
then
other
watchmen
came
together
and
barred
every
passage
to
the
weary
one
and
the
wretched
one
cried
from
his
heart
and
ran
here
and
there
and
moaned
to
himself
surely
this
watchman
is
izrá
íl
my
angel
of
death
following
so
fast
upon
me
or
he
is
a
tyrant
of
men
seeking
to
harm
his
feet
carried
him
on
the
one
bleeding
with
the
arrow
of
love
and
his
heart
lamented
then
he
came
to
a
garden
wall
and
with
untold
pain
he
scaled
it
for
it
proved
very
high
and
forgetting
his
life
he
threw
himself
down
to
the
garden
and
there
he
beheld
his
beloved
with
a
lamp
in
her
hand
searching
for
a
ring
she
had
lost
when
the
lover
looked
on
his
ravishing
love
he
drew
a
great
breath
and
raised
up
his
hands
in
prayer
crying
o
god
give
thou
glory
to
the
watchman
and
riches
and
long
life
for
the
watchman
was
gabriel
guiding
this
poor
one
or
he
was
isráfíl
bringing
life
to
this
wretched
one
indeed
his
words
were
true
for
he
had
found
many
a
secret
justice
in
this
seeming
tyranny
of
the
watchman
and
seen
how
many
a
mercy
lay
hid
behind
the
veil
out
of
wrath
the
guard
had
led
him
who
was
athirst
in
love
s
desert
to
the
sea
of
his
loved
one
and
lit
up
the
dark
night
of
absence
with
the
light
of
reunion
he
had
driven
one
who
was
afar
into
the
garden
of
nearness
had
guided
an
ailing
soul
to
the
heart
s
physician
now
if
the
lover
could
have
looked
ahead
he
would
have
blessed
the
watchman
at
the
start
and
prayed
on
his
behalf
and
he
would
have
seen
that
tyranny
as
justice
but
since
the
end
was
veiled
to
him
he
moaned
and
made
his
plaint
in
the
beginning
yet
those
who
journey
in
the
garden
land
of
knowledge
because
they
see
the
end
in
the
beginning
see
peace
in
war
and
friendliness
in
anger
such
is
the
state
of
the
wayfarers
in
this
valley
but
the
people
of
the
valleys
above
this
see
the
end
and
the
beginning
as
one
nay
they
see
neither
beginning
nor
end
and
witness
neither
first
nor
nay
rather
the
denizens
of
the
undying
city
who
dwell
in
the
green
garden
land
see
not
even
neither
first
nor
last
they
fly
from
all
that
is
first
and
repulse
all
that
is
last
for
these
have
passed
over
the
worlds
of
names
and
fled
beyond
the
worlds
of
attributes
as
swift
as
lightning
thus
is
it
said
absolute
unity
excludeth
all
and
they
have
made
their
in
the
shadow
of
the
essence
wherefore
relevant
to
this
khájih
abdu
lláh
god
the
most
high
sanctify
his
beloved
made
a
subtle
point
and
spoken
an
eloquent
word
as
to
the
meaning
of
guide
thou
us
on
the
straight
path
which
is
show
us
the
right
way
that
is
honor
us
with
the
love
of
thine
essence
that
we
may
be
freed
from
turning
toward
ourselves
and
toward
all
else
save
thee
and
may
become
wholly
thine
and
know
only
thee
and
see
only
thee
and
think
of
none
save
nay
these
even
mount
above
this
station
wherefore
it
is
said
love
is
a
veil
betwixt
the
lover
and
the
loved
one
more
than
this
i
am
not
permitted
to
tell
at
this
hour
the
morn
of
knowledge
hath
arisen
and
the
lamps
of
wayfaring
and
wandering
are
quenched
veiled
from
this
was
moses
though
all
strength
and
light
then
thou
who
hast
no
wings
at
all
attempt
not
flight
if
thou
be
a
man
of
communion
and
prayer
soar
up
on
the
wings
of
assistance
from
holy
souls
that
thou
mayest
behold
the
mysteries
of
the
friend
and
attain
to
the
lights
of
the
beloved
verily
we
are
from
god
and
to
him
shall
we
after
passing
through
the
valley
of
knowledge
which
is
the
last
plane
of
limitation
the
wayfarer
cometh
to
the
valley
of
unity
and
drinketh
from
the
cup
of
the
absolute
and
gazeth
on
the
manifestations
of
oneness
in
this
station
he
pierceth
the
veils
of
plurality
fleeth
from
the
worlds
of
the
flesh
and
ascendeth
into
the
heaven
of
singleness
with
the
ear
of
god
he
heareth
with
the
eye
of
god
he
beholdeth
the
mysteries
of
divine
creation
he
steppeth
into
the
sanctuary
of
the
friend
and
shareth
as
an
intimate
the
pavilion
of
the
loved
one
he
stretcheth
out
the
hand
of
truth
from
the
sleeve
of
the
absolute
he
revealeth
the
secrets
of
power
he
seeth
in
himself
neither
name
nor
fame
nor
rank
but
findeth
his
own
praise
in
praising
god
he
beholdeth
in
his
own
name
the
name
of
god
to
him
all
songs
are
from
the
king
and
every
melody
from
him
he
sitteth
on
the
throne
of
say
all
is
from
god
and
taketh
his
rest
on
the
carpet
of
there
is
no
power
or
might
but
in
he
looketh
on
all
things
with
the
eye
of
oneness
and
seeth
the
brilliant
rays
of
the
divine
sun
shining
from
the
of
essence
alike
on
all
created
things
and
the
lights
of
singleness
reflected
over
all
creation
it
is
clear
to
thine
eminence
that
all
the
variations
which
the
wayfarer
in
the
stages
of
his
journey
beholdeth
in
the
realms
of
being
proceed
from
his
own
vision
we
shall
give
an
example
of
this
that
its
meaning
may
become
fully
clear
consider
the
visible
sun
although
it
shineth
with
one
radiance
upon
all
things
and
at
the
behest
of
the
king
of
manifestation
bestoweth
light
on
all
creation
yet
in
each
place
it
becometh
manifest
and
sheddeth
its
bounty
according
to
the
potentialities
of
that
place
for
instance
in
a
mirror
it
reflecteth
its
own
disk
and
shape
and
this
is
due
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
mirror
in
a
crystal
it
maketh
fire
to
appear
and
in
other
things
it
showeth
only
the
effect
of
its
shining
but
not
its
full
disk
and
yet
through
that
effect
by
the
command
of
the
creator
it
traineth
each
thing
according
to
the
quality
of
that
thing
as
thou
observest
in
like
manner
colors
become
visible
in
every
object
according
to
the
nature
of
that
object
for
instance
in
a
yellow
globe
the
rays
shine
yellow
in
a
white
the
rays
are
white
and
in
a
red
the
red
rays
are
manifest
then
these
variations
are
from
the
object
not
from
the
shining
light
and
if
a
place
be
shut
away
from
the
light
as
by
walls
or
a
roof
it
will
be
entirely
bereft
of
the
splendor
of
the
light
nor
will
the
sun
shine
thereon
thus
it
is
that
certain
invalid
souls
have
confined
the
lands
of
knowledge
within
the
wall
of
self
and
passion
and
clouded
them
with
ignorance
and
blindness
and
have
been
veiled
from
the
light
of
the
mystic
sun
and
the
mysteries
of
the
eternal
beloved
they
have
strayed
afar
from
the
jewelled
wisdom
of
the
lucid
faith
of
the
lord
of
messengers
have
been
shut
out
of
the
sanctuary
of
the
one
and
banished
from
the
ka
bih
of
splendor
such
is
the
worth
of
the
people
of
this
age
and
if
a
nightingale
soar
upward
from
the
clay
of
self
and
dwell
in
the
rose
bower
of
the
heart
and
in
arabian
melodies
and
sweet
íránian
songs
recount
the
mysteries
of
single
word
of
which
quickeneth
to
fresh
new
life
the
bodies
of
the
dead
and
bestoweth
the
holy
spirit
upon
the
moldering
bones
of
this
wilt
behold
a
thousand
claws
of
envy
a
myriad
beaks
of
rancor
hunting
after
him
and
with
all
their
power
intent
upon
his
death
yea
to
the
beetle
a
sweet
fragrance
seemeth
foul
and
to
the
man
sick
of
a
rheum
a
pleasant
perfume
is
as
naught
wherefore
it
hath
been
said
for
the
guidance
of
the
ignorant
cleanse
thou
the
rheum
from
out
thine
head
and
breathe
the
breath
of
god
instead
in
sum
the
differences
in
objects
have
now
been
made
plain
thus
when
the
wayfarer
gazeth
only
upon
the
place
of
is
when
he
seeth
only
the
beholdeth
yellow
and
red
and
white
hence
it
is
that
conflict
hath
prevailed
among
the
creatures
and
a
darksome
dust
from
limited
souls
hath
hid
the
world
and
some
do
gaze
upon
the
effulgence
of
the
light
and
some
have
drunk
of
the
wine
of
oneness
and
these
see
nothing
but
the
sun
itself
thus
for
that
they
move
on
these
three
differing
planes
the
understanding
and
the
words
of
the
wayfarers
have
differed
and
hence
the
sign
of
conflict
doth
continually
appear
on
earth
for
some
there
are
who
dwell
upon
the
plane
of
oneness
and
speak
of
that
world
and
some
inhabit
the
realms
of
limitation
and
some
the
grades
of
self
while
others
are
completely
veiled
thus
do
the
ignorant
people
of
the
day
who
have
no
portion
of
the
radiance
of
divine
beauty
make
certain
claims
and
in
every
age
and
cycle
inflict
on
the
people
of
the
sea
of
oneness
what
they
themselves
deserve
should
god
punish
men
for
their
perverse
doings
he
would
not
leave
on
earth
a
moving
thing
but
to
an
appointed
term
doth
he
respite
them
o
my
brother
a
pure
heart
is
as
a
mirror
cleanse
it
with
the
burnish
of
love
and
severance
from
all
save
god
that
the
true
sun
may
shine
within
it
and
the
eternal
morning
dawn
then
wilt
thou
clearly
see
the
meaning
of
neither
doth
my
earth
nor
my
heaven
contain
me
but
the
heart
of
my
faithful
servant
containeth
and
thou
wilt
take
up
thy
life
in
thine
hand
and
with
infinite
longing
cast
it
before
the
new
beloved
one
whensoever
the
light
of
manifestation
of
the
king
of
oneness
settleth
upon
the
throne
of
the
heart
and
soul
his
shining
becometh
visible
in
every
limb
and
member
at
that
time
the
mystery
of
the
famed
tradition
gleameth
out
of
the
darkness
a
servant
is
drawn
unto
me
in
prayer
until
i
answer
him
and
when
i
have
answered
him
i
become
the
ear
wherewith
he
heareth
for
thus
the
master
of
the
house
hath
appeared
within
his
home
and
all
the
pillars
of
the
dwelling
are
ashine
with
his
light
and
the
action
and
effect
of
the
light
are
from
the
so
it
is
that
all
move
through
him
and
arise
by
his
will
and
this
is
that
spring
whereof
the
near
ones
drink
as
it
is
said
a
fount
whereof
the
near
unto
god
shall
drink
however
let
none
construe
these
utterances
to
be
anthropomorphism
nor
see
in
them
the
descent
of
the
worlds
of
god
into
the
grades
of
the
creatures
nor
should
they
lead
thine
eminence
to
such
assumptions
for
god
is
in
his
essence
holy
above
ascent
and
descent
entrance
and
exit
he
hath
through
all
eternity
been
free
of
the
attributes
of
human
creatures
and
ever
will
remain
so
no
man
hath
ever
known
him
no
soul
hath
ever
found
the
pathway
to
his
being
every
mystic
knower
hath
wandered
far
astray
in
the
valley
of
the
knowledge
of
him
every
saint
hath
lost
his
way
in
seeking
to
comprehend
his
essence
sanctified
is
he
above
the
understanding
of
the
wise
exalted
is
he
above
the
knowledge
of
the
knowing
the
way
is
barred
and
to
seek
it
is
impiety
his
proof
is
his
signs
his
being
is
his
evidence
wherefore
the
lovers
of
the
face
of
the
beloved
have
said
o
thou
the
one
whose
essence
alone
showeth
the
way
to
his
essence
and
who
is
sanctified
above
any
likeness
to
his
how
can
utter
nothingness
gallop
its
steed
in
the
field
of
preexistence
or
a
fleeting
shadow
reach
to
the
everlasting
sun
the
friend
hath
said
but
for
thee
we
had
not
known
thee
and
the
beloved
hath
said
nor
attained
thy
yea
these
mentionings
that
have
been
made
of
the
grades
of
knowledge
relate
to
the
knowledge
of
the
manifestations
of
that
sun
of
reality
which
casteth
its
light
upon
the
mirrors
and
the
splendor
of
that
light
is
in
the
hearts
yet
it
is
hidden
under
the
veilings
of
sense
and
the
conditions
of
this
earth
even
as
a
candle
within
a
lantern
of
iron
and
only
when
the
lantern
is
removed
doth
the
light
of
the
candle
shine
out
in
like
manner
when
thou
strippest
the
wrappings
of
illusion
from
off
thine
heart
the
lights
of
oneness
will
be
made
manifest
then
it
is
clear
that
even
for
the
rays
there
is
neither
entrance
nor
much
less
for
that
essence
of
being
and
that
mystery
o
my
brother
journey
upon
these
planes
in
the
spirit
of
search
not
in
blind
imitation
a
true
wayfarer
will
not
be
kept
back
by
the
bludgeon
of
words
nor
debarred
by
the
warning
of
allusions
how
shall
a
curtain
part
the
lover
and
the
loved
one
not
alexander
s
wall
can
separate
them
secrets
are
many
but
strangers
are
myriad
volumes
will
not
suffice
to
hold
the
mystery
of
the
beloved
one
nor
can
it
be
exhausted
in
these
pages
although
it
be
no
more
than
a
word
no
more
than
a
sign
knowledge
is
a
single
point
but
the
ignorant
have
multiplied
on
this
same
basis
ponder
likewise
the
differences
among
the
worlds
although
the
divine
worlds
be
never
ending
yet
some
refer
to
them
as
four
the
world
of
time
zamán
which
is
the
one
that
hath
both
a
beginning
and
an
end
the
world
of

which
hath
a
beginning
but
whose
end
is
not
revealed
the
world
of
perpetuity

whose
beginning
is
not
to
be
seen

which
is
known
to
have
an
end
and
the
world
of

azal
neither
a
beginning
nor
an
end
of
which
is
visible
although
there
are
many
differing
statements
as
to
these
points
to
recount
them
in
detail
would
result
in
weariness
thus
some
have
said
that
the
world
of
perpetuity
hath
neither
beginning
nor
end
and
have
named
the
world
of
eternity
as
the
invisible
impregnable
empyrean
others
have
called
these
the
worlds
of
the
heavenly
court

of
the
kingdom
of
the

of

the
journeys
in
the
pathway
of
love
are
reckoned
as
four
from
the
creatures
to
the
true

from
the
true
one
to
the
creatures
from
the
creatures
to
the
creatures
from
the
true
one
to
the
true
one
there
is
many
an
utterance
of
the
mystic
seers
and
doctors
of
former
times
which
i
have
not
mentioned
here
since
i
mislike
the
copious
citation
from
sayings
of
the
past
for
quotation
from
the
words
of
others
proveth
acquired
learning
not
the
divine
bestowal
even
so
much
as
we
have
quoted
here
is
out
of
deference
to
the
wont
of
men
and
after
the
manner
of
the
friends
further
such
matters
are
beyond
the
scope
of
this
epistle
our
unwillingness
to
recount
their
sayings
is
not
from
pride
rather
is
it
a
manifestation
of
wisdom
and
a
demonstration
of
grace
if
khidr
did
wreck
the
vessel
on
the
sea
yet
in
this
wrong
there
are
a
thousand
rights
otherwise
this
servant
regardeth
himself
as
utterly
lost
and
as
nothing
even
beside
one
of
the
beloved
of
god
how
much
less
in
the
presence
of
his
holy
ones
exalted
be
my
lord
the
supreme
moreover
our
aim
is
to
recount
the
stages
of
the
wayfarer
s
journey
not
to
set
forth
the
conflicting
utterances
of
the
mystics
although
a
brief
example
hath
been
given
concerning
the
beginning
and
ending
of
the
relative
world
the
world
of
attributes
yet
a
second
illustration
is
now
added
that
the
full
meaning
may
be
manifest
for
instance
let
thine
eminence
consider
his
own
self
thou
art
first
in
relation
to
thy
son
last
in
relation
to
thy
father
in
thine
outward
appearance
thou
tellest
of
the
appearance
of
power
in
the
realms
of
divine
creation
in
thine
inward
being
thou
revealest
the
hidden
mysteries
which
are
the
divine
trust
deposited
within
thee
and
thus
firstness
and
lastness
outwardness
and
inwardness
are
in
the
sense
referred
to
true
of
thyself
that
in
these
four
states
conferred
upon
thee
thou
shouldst
comprehend
the
four
divine
states
and
that
the
nightingale
of
thine
heart
on
all
the
branches
of
the
rosetree
of
existence
whether
visible
or
concealed
should
cry
out
he
is
the
first
and
the
last
the
seen
and
the
hidden
these
statements
are
made
in
the
sphere
of
that
which
is
relative
because
of
the
limitations
of
men
otherwise
those
personages
who
in
a
single
step
have
passed
over
the
world
of
the
relative
and
the
limited
and
dwelt
on
the
fair
plane
of
the
absolute
and
pitched
their
tent
in
the
worlds
of
authority
and
burned
away
these
relativities
with
a
single
spark
and
blotted
out
these
words
with
a
drop
of
dew
and
they
swim
in
the
sea
of
the
spirit
and
soar
in
the
holy
air
of
light
then
what
life
have
words
on
such
a
plane
that
first
and
last
or
other
than
these
be
seen
or
mentioned
in
this
realm
the
first
is
the
last
itself
and
the
last
is
but
the
first
in
thy
soul
of
love
build
thou
a
fire
and
burn
all
thoughts
and
words
entire
o
my
friend
look
upon
thyself
hadst
thou
not
become
a
father
nor
begotten
a
son
neither
wouldst
thou
have
heard
these
sayings
now
forget
them
all
that
thou
mayest
learn
from
the
master
of
love
in
the
schoolhouse
of
oneness
and
return
unto
god
and
forsake
the
inner
land
of
unreality
for
thy
true
station
and
dwell
within
the
shadow
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
o
thou
dear
one
impoverish
thyself
that
thou
mayest
enter
the
high
court
of
riches
and
humble
thy
body
that
thou
mayest
drink
from
the
river
of
glory
and
attain
to
the
full
meaning
of
the
poems
whereof
thou
hadst
asked
thus
it
hath
been
made
clear
that
these
stages
depend
on
the
vision
of
the
wayfarer
in
every
city
he
will
behold
a
world
in
every
valley
reach
a
spring
in
every
meadow
hear
a
song
but
the
falcon
of
the
mystic
heaven
hath
many
a
wondrous
carol
of
the
spirit
in
his
breast
and
the
persian
bird
keepeth
in
his
soul
many
a
sweet
arab
melody
yet
these
are
hidden
and
hidden
shall
remain
if
i
speak
forth
many
a
mind
will
shatter
and
if
i
write
many
a
pen
will
break
peace
be
upon
him
who
concludeth
this
exalted
journey
and
followeth
the
true
one
by
the
lights
of
guidance
and
the
wayfarer
after
traversing
the
high
planes
of
this
supernal
journey
entereth
the
valley
of
contentment
in
this
valley
he
feeleth
the
winds
of
divine
contentment
blowing
from
the
plane
of
the
spirit
he
burneth
away
the
veils
of
want
and
with
inward
and
outward
eye
perceiveth
within
and
without
all
things
the
day
of
god
will
compensate
each
one
out
of
his
from
sorrow
he
turneth
to
bliss
from
anguish
to
joy
his
grief
and
mourning
yield
to
delight
and
rapture
although
to
outward
view
the
wayfarers
in
this
valley
may
dwell
upon
the
dust
yet
inwardly
they
are
throned
in
the
heights
of
mystic
meaning
they
eat
of
the
endless
bounties
of
inner
significances
and
drink
of
the
delicate
wines
of
the
spirit
the
tongue
faileth
in
describing
these
three
valleys
and
speech
falleth
short
the
pen
steppeth
not
into
this
region
the
ink
leaveth
only
a
blot
in
these
planes
the
nightingale
of
the
heart
hath
other
songs
and
secrets
which
make
the
heart
to
stir
and
the
soul
to
clamor
but
this
mystery
of
inner
meaning
may
be
whispered
only
from
heart
to
heart
confided
only
from
breast
to
breast
only
heart
to
heart
can
speak
the
bliss
of
mystic
knowers
no
messenger
can
tell
it
and
no
missive
bear
it
i
am
silent
from
weakness
on
many
a
matter
for
my
words
could
not
reckon
them
and
my
speech
would
fall
short
o
friend
till
thou
enter
the
garden
of
such
mysteries
thou
shalt
never
set
lip
to
the
undying
wine
of
this
valley
and
shouldst
thou
taste
of
it
thou
wilt
shield
thine
eyes
from
all
things
else
and
drink
of
the
wine
of
contentment
and
thou
wilt
loose
thyself
from
all
things
else
and
bind
thyself
to
him
and
throw
thy
life
down
in
his
path
and
cast
thy
soul
away
however
there
is
no
other
in
this
region
that
thou
need
forget
there
was
god
and
there
was
naught
beside
for
on
this
plane
the
traveler
witnesseth
the
beauty
of
the
friend
in
everything
even
in
fire
he
seeth
the
face
of
the
beloved
he
beholdeth
in
illusion
the
secret
of
reality
and
readeth
from
the
attributes
the
riddle
of
the
essence
for
he
hath
burnt
away
the
veils
with
his
sighing
and
unwrapped
the
shroudings
with
a
single
glance
with
piercing
sight
he
gazeth
on
the
new
creation
with
lucid
heart
he
graspeth
subtle
verities
this
is
sufficiently
attested
by
and
we
have
made
thy
sight
sharp
in
this
after
journeying
through
the
planes
of
pure
contentment
the
traveler
cometh
to
the
valley
of
wonderment
and
is
tossed
in
the
oceans
of
grandeur
and
at
every
moment
his
wonder
groweth
now
he
seeth
the
shape
of
wealth
as
poverty
itself
and
the
essence
of
freedom
as
sheer
impotence
now
is
he
struck
dumb
with
the
beauty
of
the
again
is
he
wearied
out
with
his
own
life
how
many
a
mystic
tree
hath
this
whirlwind
of
wonderment
snatched
by
the
roots
how
many
a
soul
hath
it
exhausted
for
in
this
valley
the
traveler
is
flung
into
confusion
albeit
in
the
eye
of
him
who
hath
attained
such
marvels
are
esteemed
and
well
beloved
at
every
moment
he
beholdeth
a
wondrous
world
a
new
creation
and
goeth
from
astonishment
to
astonishment
and
is
lost
in
awe
at
the
works
of
the
lord
of
oneness
indeed
o
brother
if
we
ponder
each
created
thing
we
shall
witness
a
myriad
perfect
wisdoms
and
learn
a
myriad
new
and
wondrous
truths
one
of
the
created
phenomena
is
the
dream
behold
how
many
secrets
are
deposited
therein
how
many
wisdoms
treasured
up
how
many
worlds
concealed
observe
how
thou
art
asleep
in
a
dwelling
and
its
doors
are
barred
on
a
sudden
thou
findest
thyself
in
a
city
which
thou
enterest
without
moving
thy
feet
or
wearying
thy
body
without
using
thine
eyes
thou
seest
without
taxing
thine
ears
thou
hearest
without
a
tongue
thou
speakest
and
perchance
when
ten
years
are
gone
thou
wilt
witness
in
the
outer
world
the
very
things
thou
hast
dreamed
tonight
now
there
are
many
wisdoms
to
ponder
in
the
dream
which
none
but
the
people
of
this
valley
can
comprehend
in
their
true
elements
first
what
is
this
world
where
without
eye
and
ear
and
hand
and
tongue
a
man
puts
all
of
these
to
use
second
how
is
it
that
in
the
outer
world
thou
seest
today
the
effect
of
a
dream
when
thou
didst
vision
it
in
the
world
of
sleep
some
ten
years
past
consider
the
difference
between
these
two
worlds
and
the
mysteries
which
they
conceal
that
thou
mayest
attain
to
divine
confirmations
and
heavenly
discoveries
and
enter
the
regions
of
holiness
god
the
exalted
hath
placed
these
signs
in
men
to
the
end
that
philosophers
may
not
deny
the
mysteries
of
the
life
beyond
nor
belittle
that
which
hath
been
promised
them
for
some
hold
to
reason
and
deny
whatever
the
reason
comprehendeth
not
and
yet
weak
minds
can
never
grasp
the
matters
which
we
have
related
but
only
the
supreme
divine
intelligence
can
comprehend
them
how
can
feeble
reason
encompass
the
qur
án
or
the
spider
snare
a
phoenix
in
his
web
all
these
states
are
to
be
witnessed
in
the
valley
of
wonderment
and
the
traveler
at
every
moment
seeketh
for
more
and
is
not
wearied
thus
the
lord
of
the
first
and
the
last
in
setting
forth
the
grades
of
contemplation
and
expressing
wonderment
hath
said
o
lord
increase
my
astonishment
at
thee
likewise
reflect
upon
the
perfection
of
man
s
creation
and
that
all
these
planes
and
states
are
folded
up
and
hidden
away
within
him
dost
thou
reckon
thyself
only
a
puny
form
when
within
thee
the
universe
is
folded
then
we
must
labor
to
destroy
the
animal
condition
till
the
meaning
of
humanity
shall
come
to
light
thus
too
luqmán
who
had
drunk
from
the
wellspring
of
wisdom
and
tasted
of
the
waters
of
mercy
in
proving
to
his
son
nathan
the
planes
of
resurrection
and
death
advanced
the
dream
as
an
evidence
and
an
example
we
relate
it
here
that
through
this
evanescent
servant
a
memory
may
endure
of
that
youth
of
the
school
of
divine
unity
that
elder
of
the
art
of
instruction
and
the
absolute
he
said
o
son
if
thou
art
able
not
to
sleep
then
thou
art
able
not
to
die
and
if
thou
art
able
not
to
waken
after
sleep
then
thou
shalt
be
able
not
to
rise
after
o
friend
the
heart
is
the
dwelling
of
eternal
mysteries
make
it
not
the
home
of
fleeting
fancies
waste
not
the
treasure
of
thy
precious
life
in
employment
with
this
swiftly
passing
world
thou
comest
from
the
world
of
not
thine
heart
to
the
earth
thou
art
a
dweller
in
the
court
of
not
the
homeland
of
the
dust
in
sum
there
is
no
end
to
the
description
of
these
stages
but
because
of
the
wrongs
inflicted
by
the
peoples
of
the
earth
this
servant
is
in
no
mood
to
continue
the
tale
is
still
unfinished
and
i
have
no
heart
for
then
pray
forgive
me
the
pen
groaneth
and
the
ink
sheddeth
tears
and
the
river
of
the
heart
moveth
in
waves
of
blood
nothing
can
befall
us
but
what
god
hath
destined
for
peace
be
upon
him
who
followeth
the
right
path
after
scaling
the
high
summits
of
wonderment
the
wayfarer
cometh
to
the
valley
of
true
poverty
and
absolute
nothingness
this
station
is
the
dying
from
self
and
the
living
in
god
the
being
poor
in
self
and
rich
in
the
desired
one
poverty
as
here
referred
to
signifieth
being
poor
in
the
things
of
the
created
world
rich
in
the
things
of
god
s
world
for
when
the
true
lover
and
devoted
friend
reacheth
to
the
presence
of
the
beloved
the
sparkling
beauty
of
the
loved
one
and
the
fire
of
the
lover
s
heart
will
kindle
a
blaze
and
burn
away
all
veils
and
wrappings
yea
all
he
hath
from
heart
to
skin
will
be
set
aflame
so
that
nothing
will
remain
save
the
friend
when
the
qualities
of
the
ancient
of
days
stood
revealed
then
the
qualities
of
earthly
things
did
moses
burn
away
he
who
hath
attained
this
station
is
sanctified
from
all
that
pertaineth
to
the
world
wherefore
if
those
who
have
come
to
the
sea
of
his
presence
are
found
to
possess
none
of
the
limited
things
of
this
perishable
world
whether
it
be
outer
wealth
or
personal
opinions
it
mattereth
not
for
whatever
the
creatures
have
is
limited
by
their
own
limits
and
whatever
the
true
one
hath
is
sanctified
therefrom
this
utterance
must
be
deeply
pondered
that
its
purport
may
be
clear
verily
the
righteous
shall
drink
of
a
winecup
tempered
at
the
camphor
if
the
interpretation
of
camphor
become
known
the
true
intention
will
be
evident
this
state
is
that
poverty
of
which
it
is
said
poverty
is
my
and
of
inward
and
outward
poverty
there
is
many
a
stage
and
many
a
meaning
which
i
have
not
thought
pertinent
to
mention
here
hence
i
have
reserved
these
for
another
time
dependent
on
what
god
may
desire
and
fate
may
seal
this
is
the
plane
whereon
the
vestiges
of
all
things
kullu
shay
are
destroyed
in
the
traveler
and
on
the
horizon
of
eternity
the
divine
face
riseth
out
of
the
darkness
and
the
meaning
of
all
on
the
earth
shall
pass
away
but
the
face
of
thy
lord
is
made
manifest
o
my
friend
listen
with
heart
and
soul
to
the
songs
of
the
spirit
and
treasure
them
as
thine
own
eyes
for
the
heavenly
wisdoms
like
the
clouds
of
spring
will
not
rain
down
on
the
earth
of
men
s
hearts
forever
and
though
the
grace
of
the
one
is
never
stilled
and
never
ceasing
yet
to
each
time
and
era
a
portion
is
allotted
and
a
bounty
set
apart
this
in
a
given
measure
and
no
one
thing
is
there
but
with
us
are
its
storehouses
and
we
send
it
not
down
but
in
settled
the
cloud
of
the
loved
one
s
mercy
raineth
only
on
the
garden
of
the
spirit
and
bestoweth
this
bounty
only
in
the
season
of
spring
the
other
seasons
have
no
share
in
this
greatest
grace
and
barren
lands
no
portion
of
this
favor
o
brother
not
every
sea
hath
pearls
not
every
branch
will
flower
nor
will
the
nightingale
sing
thereon
then
ere
the
nightingale
of
the
mystic
paradise
repair
to
the
garden
of
god
and
the
rays
of
the
heavenly
morning
return
to
the
sun
of
thou
an
effort
that
haply
in
this
dustheap
of
the
mortal
world
thou
mayest
catch
a
fragrance
from
the
everlasting
garden
and
live
forever
in
the
shadow
of
the
peoples
of
this
city
and
when
thou
hast
attained
this
highest
station
and
come
to
this
mightiest
plane
then
shalt
thou
gaze
on
the
beloved
and
forget
all
else
the
beloved
shineth
on
gate
and
wall
without
a
veil
o
men
of
vision
now
hast
thou
abandoned
the
drop
of
life
and
come
to
the
sea
of
the
this
is
the
goal
thou
didst
ask
for
if
it
be
god
s
will
thou
wilt
gain
it
in
this
city
even
the
veils
of
light
are
split
asunder
and
vanish
away
his
beauty
hath
no
veiling
save
light
his
face
no
covering
save
how
strange
that
while
the
beloved
is
visible
as
the
sun
yet
the
heedless
still
hunt
after
tinsel
and
base
metal
yea
the
intensity
of
his
revelation
hath
covered
him
and
the
fullness
of
his
shining
forth
hath
hidden
him
even
as
the
sun
bright
hath
he
shined
but
alas
he
hath
come
to
the
town
of
the
blind
in
this
valley
the
wayfarer
leaveth
behind
him
the
stages
of
the
oneness
of
being
and
manifestation
and
reacheth
a
oneness
that
is
sanctified
above
these
two
stations
ecstasy
alone
can
encompass
this
theme
not
utterance
nor
argument
and
whosoever
hath
dwelt
at
this
stage
of
the
journey
or
caught
a
breath
from
this
garden
land
knoweth
whereof
we
speak
in
all
these
journeys
the
traveler
must
stray
not
the
breadth
of
a
hair
from
the
law
for
this
is
indeed
the
secret
of
the
path
and
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
truth
and
in
all
these
stages
he
must
cling
to
the
robe
of
obedience
to
the
commandments
and
hold
fast
to
the
cord
of
shunning
all
forbidden
things
that
he
may
be
nourished
from
the
cup
of
the
law
and
informed
of
the
mysteries
of
truth
if
any
of
the
utterances
of
this
servant
may
not
be
comprehended
or
may
lead
to
perturbation
the
same
must
be
inquired
of
again
that
no
doubt
may
linger
and
the
meaning
be
clear
as
the
face
of
the
beloved
one
shining
from
the
glorious
these
journeys
have
no
visible
ending
in
the
world
of
time
but
the
severed
invisible
confirmation
descend
upon
him
and
the
guardian
of
the
cause
assist
cross

rather
in

breaths
nay
rather
in

it

this
is
of
his
grace

such
of
his

as
he
they
who
soar
in

this

the

of

to
this

this

the

is

the

that

i
am
wondering
why
the
tie
of
love
was
so
abruptly
severed
and
the
firm
covenant
of
friendship
broken
did
ever
god
forbid
my
devotion
lessen
or
my
deep
affection
fail
that
thou
hast
thus
forgot
me
and
blotted
me
from
thy
thoughts
what
fault
of
mine
hath
made
thee
cease
thy
favors
is
it
that
we
are
lowly
and
thou
of
high
degree
or
is
that
a
single
arrow
hath
driven
thee
from
the
battle
have
they
not
told
thee
that
faithfulness
is
a
duty
on
those
who
follow
the
mystic
way
that
it
is
the
true
guide
to
his
holy
presence
but
as
for
those
who
say
our
lord
is
god
and
who
go
straight
to
him
the
angels
shall
descend
to
them
likewise
he
saith
go
straight
on
then
as
thou
hast
been
wherefore
this
course
is
incumbent
on
those
who
dwell
in
the
presence
of
god
i
do
as
bidden
and
i
bring
the
message
whether
it
give
thee
counsel
or
offense
albeit
i
have
received
no
answer
to
my
letters
and
it
is
contrary
to
the
usage
of
the
wise
to
express
my
regard
anew
yet
this
new
love
hath
broken
all
the
old
rules
and
ways
tell
us
not
the
tale
of
laylí
or
of
majnún
s
thy
love
hath
made
the
world
forget
the
loves
of
long
ago
when
once
thy
name
was
on
the
tongue
the
lovers
caught
it
and
it
set
the
speakers
and

hearers
dancing

why

hear
that
thou

that
some

high

hath
taken
thee
to
sanandaj
o
my
eminent
friend
those
who
progress
in
mystic
wayfaring
are
of
four
kinds
i
shall
describe
them
in
brief
that
the
grades
and
qualities
of
each
kind
may
become
plain
to
thee
the
first
valley
if
the
travelers
seek
after
the
goal
of
the
intended
one
maqsúd
this
station
appertaineth
to
the
that
self
which
is
the
self
of
god
standing
within
him
with
on
this
plane
the
self
is
not
rejected
but
beloved
it
is
and
not
to
be
shunned
although
at
the
beginning
this
plane
is
the
realm
of
conflict
yet
it
endeth
in
attainment
to
the
throne
of
splendor
as
they
have
said
o
abraham
of
this
day
o
friend
abraham
of
the
spirit
kill
these
four
birds
of
prey
that
after
death
the
riddle
of
life
may
be
unraveled
this
is
the
plane
of
the
soul
who
is
pleasing
unto
god
refer
to
the
verse
o
thou
soul
who
art
well
assured
return
to
thy
lord
and
pleasing
unto
him
which
endeth
enter
thou
among
my
servants
and
enter
thou
my
paradise
this
station
hath
many
signs
unnumbered
proofs
hence
it
is
said
hereafter
we
will
show
them
our
signs
in
the
regions
of
the
earth
and
in
themselves
until
it
become
manifest
unto
them
that
it
is
the
truth
and
that
there
is
no
god
save
him
one
must
then
read
the
book
of
his
own
self
rather
than
some
treatise
on
rhetoric
wherefore
he
hath
said
read
thy
book
there
needeth
none
but
thyself
to
make
out
an
account
against
thee
this
the
story
is
told
of
a
mystic
knower
who
went
on
a
journey
with
a
learned
grammarian
as
his
companion
they
came
to
the
shore
of
the
sea
of
grandeur
the
knower
straightway
flung
himself
into
the
waves
but
the
grammarian
stood
lost
in
his
reasonings
which
were
as
words
that
are
written
on
water
the
knower
called
out
to
him
why
dost
thou
not
follow
the
grammarian
answered
o
brother
i
dare
not
advance
i
must
needs
go
back
then
the
knower
cried
forget
what
thou
didst
read
in
the
books
of
síbávayh
and
qawlavayh
of
and
and
cross
the
the
death
of
self
is
needed
here
not
rhetoric
be
nothing
then
and
walk
upon
the
waves
likewise
is
it
written
and
be
ye
not
like
those
who
forget
god
and
whom
he
hath
therefore
caused
to
forget
their
own
selves
these
are
the
wicked
the
second
valley
if
the
wayfarer
s
goal
be
the
dwelling
of
the
praiseworthy
one
maḥmúd
this
is
the
station
of
primal
reason
which
is
known
as
the
prophet
and
the
most
great
pillar
here
reason
signifieth
the
divine
universal
mind
whose
sovereignty
enlighteneth
all
created
doth
it
refer
to
every
feeble
brain
for
it
is
as
the
wise
saná
í
hath
written
how
can
feeble
reason
encompass
the
qur
án
or
the
spider
snare
a
phoenix
in
his
web
wouldst
thou
that
the
mind
should
not
entrap
thee
teach
it
the
science
of
the
love
of
god
on
this
plane
the
traveler
meeteth
with
many
a
trial
and
reverse
now
is
he
lifted
up
to
heaven
now
is
he
cast
into
the
depths
as
it
hath
been
said
now
thou
drawest
me
to
the
summit
of
glory
again
thou
castest
me
into
the
lowest
the
mystery
treasured
in
this
plane
is
divulged
in
the
following
holy
verse
from
the
súrih
of
the
cave
and
thou
mightest
have
seen
the
sun
when
it
arose
pass
on
the
right
of
their
cave
and
when
it
set
leave
them
on
the
left
while
they
were
in
its
spacious
chamber
this
is
one
of
the
signs
of
god
guided
indeed
is
he
whom
god
guideth
but
for
him
whom
he
misleadeth
thou
shalt
by
no
means
find
a
if
a
man
could
know
what
lieth
hid
in
this
one
verse
it
would
suffice
him
wherefore
in
praise
of
such
as
these
he
hath
said
men
whom
neither
merchandise
nor
traffic
beguile
from
the
remembrance
of
god
this
station
conferreth
the
true
standard
of
knowledge
and
freeth
man
from
tests
in
this
realm
to
search
after
knowledge
is
irrelevant
for
he
hath
said
concerning
the
guidance
of
travelers
on
this
plane
fear
god
and
god
will
instruct
and
again
knowledge
is
a
light
which
god
casteth
into
the
heart
of
whomsoever
he
wherefore
a
man
should
make
ready
his
heart
that
it
be
worthy
of
the
descent
of
heavenly
grace
and
that
the
bounteous
may
give
him
to
drink
of
the
wine
of
bestowal
from
the
merciful
vessel
for
the
like
of
this
let
the
travailers
travail
and
now
do
i
say
verily
we
are
from
god
and
to
him
shall
we
the
third
valley
if
the
loving
seekers
wish
to
live
within
the
precincts
of
the
attracting
one
majdhúb
no
soul
may
dwell
on
this
kingly
throne
save
the
beauty
of
love
this
realm
is
not
to
be
pictured
in
words
love
shunneth
this
world
and
that
world
too
in
him
are
lunacies
the
minstrel
of
love
harpeth
this
lay
servitude
enslaveth
kingship
doth
betray
this
plane
requireth
pure
affection
and
the
bright
stream
of
fellowship
in
telling
of
these
companions
of
the
cave
he
saith
they
speak
not
till
he
hath
spoken
and
they
do
his
on
this
plane
neither
the
reign
of
reason
is
sufficient
nor
the
authority
of
self
hence
one
of
the
prophets
of
god
hath
asked
o
my
lord
how
shall
we
reach
unto
thee
and
the
answer
came
leave
thyself
behind
and
then
approach
these
are
a
people
who
deem
the
lowest
place
to
be
one
with
the
throne
of
glory
and
to
them
beauty
s
bower
differeth
not
from
the
field
of
a
battle
fought
in
the
cause
of
the
beloved
the
denizens
of
this
plane
speak
no
they
gallop
their
chargers
they
see
but
the
inner
reality
of
the
beloved
to
them
all
words
of
sense
are
meaningless
and
senseless
words
are
full
of
meaning
they
can
not
tell
one
limb
from
another
one
part
from
another
to
them
the
mirage
is
the
real
river
to
them
going
away
is
returning
wherefore
hath
it
been
said
the
story
of
thy
beauty
reached
the
hermit
s
dell
crazed
he
sought
the
tavern
where
the
wine
they
buy
and
sell
the
love
of
thee
hath
leveled
down
the
fort
of
patience
the
pain
of
thee
hath
firmly
barred
the
gate
of
hope
as
well
in
this
realm
instruction
is
assuredly
of
no
avail
the
lover
s
teacher
is
the
loved
one

beauty
his

their

and
their
only
book
learning
of
wonderment
of
longing
love
their
duty
not
on
learned
chapters
and
dull
themes
they
look
the
chain
that
binds
them
is
his
musky
hair
the
cyclic
scheme
to
them
is
but
to
him
a
stair
here
followeth
a
supplication
to
god
the
exalted
the
glorified
o
lord
o
thou
whose
bounty
granteth

i
stand
before
thee
all
save
thee
forgetting
grant
that
the
mote
of
knowledge
in
my
spirit
escape
desire
and
the
lowly
clay
grant
that
thine
ancient
gift
this
drop
of
wisdom
merge
with
thy
mighty
sea
thus
do
i
say
there
is
no
power
or
might
save
in
god
the
protector
the
the
fourth
valley
if
the
mystic
knowers
be
of
those
who
have
reached
to
the
beauty
of
the
beloved
one
mahbúb
this
station
is
the
apex
of
consciousness
and
the
secret
of
divine
guidance
this
is
the
center
of
the
mystery
he
doth
what
he
willeth
ordaineth
what
he
were
all
the
denizens
of
earth
and
heaven
to
unravel
this
shining
allusion
this
darksome
riddle
until
the
day
when
the
trumpet
soundeth
yet
would
they
fail
to
comprehend
even
a
letter
thereof
for
this
is
the
station
of
god
s
immutable
decree
his
foreordained
mystery
hence
when
searchers
inquired
of
this
he
made
reply
this
is
a
bottomless
sea
which
none
shall
ever
and
they
asked
again
and
he
answered
it
is
the
blackest
of
nights
through
which
none
can
find
his
whoso
knoweth
this
secret
will
assuredly
hide
it
and
were
he
to
reveal
but
its
faintest
trace
they
would
nail
him
to
the
cross
yet
by
the
living
god
were
there
any
true
seeker
i
would
divulge
it
to
him
for
they
have
said
love
is
a
light
that
never
dwelleth
in
a
heart
possessed
by
verily
the
wayfarer
who
journeyeth
unto
god
unto
the
crimson
pillar
in
the
path
will
never
reach
unto
his
heavenly
goal
unless
he
abandoneth
all
that
men
possess
and
if
he
feareth
not
god
god
will
make
him
to
fear
all
things
whereas
all
things
fear
him
who
feareth
speak
in
the
persian
tongue
though
the
arab
please
thee
more
a
lover
hath
many
a
tongue
at
his
command
how
sweet
is
this
couplet
which
revealeth
such
a
truth
see
our
hearts
come
open
like
shells
when
he
raineth
grace
like
pearls
and
our
lives
are
ready
targets
when
agony
s
arrows
he
hurls
and
were
it
not
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
book
i
would
verily
bequeath
a
part
of
my
possessions
to
the
one
who
would
put
me
to
death
and
i
would
name
him
my
heir
yea
i
would
bestow
upon
him
a
portion
would
render
him
thanks
would
seek
to
refresh
mine
eyes
with
the
touch
of
his
hand
but
what
can
i
do
i
have
no
possessions
no
power
and
this
is
what
god
hath
ordained
methinks
at
this
moment
i
catch
the
fragrance
of
his
garment
blowing
from
the
egypt
of
bahá
verily
he
seemeth
near
at
hand
though
men
may
think
him
far
away
my
soul
doth
smell
the
perfume
shed
by
the
beloved
one
my
sense
is
filled
with
the
fragrance
of
my
dear
companion
the
duty
of
long
years
of
love
obey
and
tell
the
tale
of
happy
days
gone
by
that
land
and

laugh
aloud
today
and
it
may
gladden

this
is
the
realm
of

awareness
of

even

wherefore
is

i

relevancy
but
two
of
these
will
suffice
to
serve
as
a
light
for
men
of
mind
and
heart
the
first
is
his
statement
o
my
servant
obey
me
and
i
shall
make
thee
like
unto
myself
i
say
be
and
it
is
and
thou
shalt
say
be
and
it
shall
and
the
second
o
son
of
adam
seek
fellowship
with
none
until
thou
hast
found
me
and
whenever
thou
shalt
long
for
me
thou
shalt
find
me
close
to
whatever
high
proofs
and
wondrous
allusions
are
recounted
herein
concern
but
a
single
letter
a
single
point
such
hath
been
the
way
of
god
and
no
change
canst
thou
find
in
the
way
of
i
began
this
epistle
some
time
ago
in
thy
remembrance
and
since
thy
letter
had
not
reached
me
then
i
began
with
some
words
of
reproach
now
thy
new
missive
hath
dispelled
that
feeling
and
causeth
me
to
write
thee
to
speak
of
my
love
for
thine
eminence
is
needless
god
is
a
sufficient
witness
for
his
eminence
shaykh
god
the
exalted
bless
him
shall

myself

two
following
verses
which
i

be
delivered
to
him
i
seek
thy
nearness
dearer
than
sweet
heaven
i
see
thy
visage
fairer
than
paradise
bowers
when
i
entrusted
this
message
of
love
to
my
pen
it
refused
the
burden
and
it
swooned
away
then
coming
to
itself
it
spoke
and
said
glory
be
to
thee
to
thee
do
i
turn
in
penitence
and
i
am
the
first
of
them
that
praise
be
to

let
us

some

this

hurt

woe
let

write
some
other

love

so
leave
blood
and

all
of
these
and
say
no
more
of
peace
be
upon
thee

upon
those
who
