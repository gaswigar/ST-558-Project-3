how
a
princess

a

of
a
king
of
ireland
heard
a
voice
singing
on
a
may
eve
like
this
and
followed

half
asleep
until
she
came
into
the
land
of
faery
where
nobody
gets
old
and
godly
and
grave
where
nobody
gets
old
and
crafty
and
wise
where
nobody
gets
old
and
bitter
of

and
she
is
still
there
busied
with
a
dance
deep
in
the
dewy
shadow
of
a
wood
or
where
stars
walk
upon
a
mountain

persuade
the
colleen
to
put
by

my
grandfather
would
mutter
just
such
things
and
he
was
no
judge
of
a
dog
or
horse
and
any
idle
boy
could
blarney
him
just
speak
your
mind
father

put
it
away
my
colleen
god
spreads
the
heavens
above
us
like
great
wings
and
gives
a
little
round
of
deeds
and
days
and
then
come
the
wrecked
angels
and
set
snares
and
bait
them
with
light
hopes
and
heavy
dreams
until
the
heart
is
puffed
with
pride
and
goes
half
shuddering
and
half
joyous
from
god
peace
and
it
was
some
wrecked
angel
blind
tears
who
flattered
edene
heart
with
merry
words
my
colleen
i
have
seen
some
other
girls
restless
and
ill
at
ease
but
years
went
by
and
they
grew
like
their
neighbours
and
were
glad
in
minding
children
working
at
the
churn
and
gossiping
of
weddings
and
of
wakes

hack
them
into
pieces

four
tongues
a
tongue
that
is
too
crafty
and
too
wise
a
tongue
that
is
too
godly
and
too
grave
a
tongue
that
is
more
bitter
than
the
tide
and
a
kind
tongue
too
full
of
drowsy
love
of
drowsy

my
captivity
shawn

god
binds
us
to

and
shuts
us
from

maddening
freedom
and
bewildering
light
shawn

would
that
the
world
were
mine
to
give

and
barren
waste
the
maddening
freedom
of
its
woods

and
the
bewildering
lights
upon
its
hills
maire

then
i
would
take
and
break
it
in
my
hands
to
see
you
smile
watching
it
crumble
away
shawn

then
i
would
mould
a
world
of
fire
and
dew
with
no
one
bitter
grave
or
over
wise
and
nothing
marred
or
old
to
do
you
wrong
and
crowd
the
enraptured
quiet
of
the
sky
with
candles
burning
to
your
lonely

your
looks
are
all
the
candles
that
i
need

once
a
fly
dancing
in
a
beam
o
the
sun
or
the
light
wind
blowing
out
of

could
fill
your
heart
with
dreams
none
other
knew
but
now
the
indissoluble
sacrament
has
mixed
your
heart
that
was
most
proud
and
cold
with
my
warm
heart
for
ever
and
sun
and
moor
must
fade
and
heaven
be
rolled
up
like
a
scroll
but
your
white
spirit
still
walk
by
my
spirit
for
not
a
power
in
earth
and
heaven
and
hell
can
break
this
bond
binding
heart
unto

faeries
dance
in
a
place
apart
shaking
their
feet
in
a
ring
tossing
their
arms
in

and
sing
of
a
land
where
even
the

their
footsteps
going
up
and
down
o
they
shall

i
hear
my
brethren
bidding

the
enchanted
flowers
will
kill
us
if
you

maurteen
bruin
they
turn
the
flowers
to
little
twisted
flames
shawn
bruin
the
little
twisted
flames

up
the
heart
the
child
i
hear
them
call
us
bride
maire
bruin
i
will
go
with
you
father
hart
she
is
lost
alas
the
child
by
the
then
follow
but
the
heavy
body
of
clay
and
clinging
mortal
hope
must
fall
from
you
for
we
who
ride
the
winds
run
on
the
waves
and
dance
upon
the
mountains
are
more
light
than
dewdrops
on
the
banners
of
the
dawn
maire
bruin
then
take
my
soul
shawn
bruin
over
to
shawn
bruin
beloved
do
not
leave
me
what
will
my
life
be
if
you
go
with
her

when
i
met
you
by
the
well
and
took
your
hand
in
mine
and
spoke
of
love
maire
bruin
dear
face
dear
voice
the
child
come
bride
maire
bruin
i
always
loved
her
world
and
yet
and
yet
i
think
that
i
would
stay
if
i
could
stay
into
his
arms
the
child
the
white
bird
white
bird
come
with
me
little
bird
maire
bruin
she
calls
my
soul
the
child
come
with
me
little
bird
maire
bruin
i
can
hear
songs
and
dancing
shawn
bruin
stay
with
me
maire
bruin
dear
i
would
stay
and
yet
and
yet
the
child
white
bird
come
little
bird
with

of
gold
maire
bruin
and
yet
the
child
come
little
bird
with
silver
feet
shawn
bruin
dead
dead
father
hart
thus
do
the
evil
spirits
snatch
their
prey
almost
out
of
the
very
hand
of
god
and
day
by
day
their
power
is
more
and
more
and
men
and
women
leave
old
paths
for
pride
comes
knocking
with
thin
knuckles
on
the
heart
a
voice
the
wind
blows
out
of
the
gates
of
the
day
the
wind
blows
over
the
lonely
of
heart
and
the
lonely
of
heart
is
withered
away
while
the
faeries
dance
in
a
place
apart
shaking
their
feet
in
a
ring
tossing
their
arms
in
the
air
for
they
hear
the
wind
laugh
and
murmur
and
sing
of
a
land
where
even
the
old
are
fair
and
even
the
wise
are
merry
of
tongue
but
i
heard
a
reed
of
coolaney
say
the
wind
has
laughed
and
murmured
and
sung
the
lonely
of
heart
must
wither
away
song
is
taken
up
by
many
voices
who
sing
loudly
as
if
in
triumph
some
of
the
voices
seem
to
come
from
within
the
