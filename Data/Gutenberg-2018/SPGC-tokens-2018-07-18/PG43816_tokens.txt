the
regeneration
of
lord
ernie
the
sacrifice
the
damned
a
descent
into
egypt
wayfarers
the
regeneration
of
lord
ernie
i
john
hendricks
was
at
the
time
he
had
originally
studied
for
holy
orders
but
had
abandoned
the
church
later
for
private
reasons
connected
with
his
faith
and
had
taken
to
teaching
and
tutoring
instead
he
was
an
honest
upstanding
fellow
of
incorruptible
intelligent
in
a
simple
straightforward
way
he
played
games
with
his
head
more
than
most
englishmen
do
but
he
went
through
life
without
much
calculation
he
had
qualities
that
made
boys
like
and
respect
him
he
won
their
confidence
poor
proud
ambitious
he
realised
that
fate
offered
him
a
chance
when
the
secretary
of
state
for
scotland
asked
him
if
he
would
give
up
his
other
pupils
for
a
year
and
take
his
son
lord
ernie
round
the
world
upon
an
educational
trip
that
might
make
a
man
of
him
for
lord
ernie
was
the
only
son
and
the
marquess
s
influence
was
naturally
great
to
have
deposited
a
regenerated
lord
ernie
at
the
castle
gates
might
have
guaranteed
hendricks
future
after
leaving
eton
prematurely
the
lad
had
come
under
hendricks
charge
for
a
time
and
with
such
excellent
results
i
d
simply
swear
by
that
chap
you
know
the
boy
used
to
say
that
his
father
considerably
impressed
and
rather
as
a
last
resort
had
made
this
proposition
and
hendricks
without
much
calculation
had
accepted
it
he
liked
bindy
for
himself
it
was
in
his
heart
to
make
a
man
of
him
if
possible
they
had
now
been
round
the
world
together
and
had
come
up
from
brindisi
to
the
italian
lakes
and
so
into
switzerland
it
was
middle
october
with
a
week
or
two
to
spare
they
were
making
leisurely
for
the
ancestral
halls
in
aberdeenshire
the
nine
months
travel
hendricks
realised
with
keen
disappointment
had
accomplished
however
very
little
the
job
had
been
exhausting
and
he
had
conscientiously
done
his
best
lord
ernie
liked
him
thoroughly
admiring
his
vigour
with
a
smile
of
tolerant
through
his
ceaseless
cigarette
smoke
they
were
almost
like
two
boys
together
you
a
chap
and
a
half
hendricks
you
really
ought
to
be
in
the
cabinet
with
my
hendricks
would
deliver
up
his
useless
parcel
at
the
castle
gates
pocket
the
thanks
and
the
fee
and
go
back
to
his
arduous
life
of
teaching
and
writing
in
dingy
lodgings
it
was
a
pity
even
on
the
lowest
grounds
the
tutor
truth
to
tell
felt
undeniably
depressed
hopeful
by
nature
optimistic
too
as
men
of
action
usually
are
he
cast
about
him
even
at
the
last
hour
for
something
that
might
stir
the
boy
to
life
wake
him
up
put
zest
and
energy
into
him
but
there
was
only
paris
now
between
them
and
the
end
and
paris
certainly
could
not
be
relied
upon
for
help
bindy
s
desire
for
paris
even
was
not
strong
enough
to
count
no
desire
in
him
was
ever
strong
there
lay
the
crux
of
the
problem
in
a
word
lord
ernie
was
without
desire
which
is
life
tall
handsome
he
was
yet
such
a
feeble
creature
without
the
energy
to
be
either
wild
or
vicious
languid
yet
certainly
not
decadent
life
ran
slowly
flabbily
in
him
he
took
to
nothing
the
first
impression
he
made
was
fine
then
nothing
his
only
tastes
if
tastes
they
could
be
called
were
tastes
he
was
vaguely
interested
in
flying
yet
not
enough
to
master
the
mechanism
of
it
he
liked
motoring
at
high
speed
being
driven
not
driving
himself
and
he
loved
to
wander
about
in
woods
making
fires
like
a
red
indian
provided
they
lit
easily
yet
even
this
not
for
the
poetry
of
the
thing
nor
for
any
love
of
adventure
but
just
i
like
fire
you
know
like
to
watch
it
heat
seemed
to
give
him
curious
satisfaction
perhaps
because
the
heat
of
life
he
realised
was
deficient
in
his
body
it
was
significant
this
love
of
fire
in
him
though
no
one
could
discover
why
as
a
child
he
had
a
dangerous
delight
in
fireworks
anything
to
do
with
fire
he
would
watch
a
candle
flame
as
though
he
were
a
but
had
never
been
known
to
make
a
single
remark
of
interest
about
it
in
a
wood
as
mentioned
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
gather
sticks
though
the
resulting
fire
was
never
part
of
any
purpose
he
had
no
purpose
there
was
no
wind
or
fire
of
life
in
the
lad
at
all
the
fine
body
was
inert
hendricks
did
wrong
of
course
in
going
where
he
did
to
this
little
desolate
village
in
the
jura
mountains
though
it
was
the
first
time
all
these
trying
months
he
had
allowed
himself
a
personal
desire
but
from
domo
dossola
the
simplon
express
would
pass
lausanne
and
from
lausanne
to
the
jura
was
but
a
step
all
on
the
way
home
moreover
and
what
prompted
him
was
merely
a
sentimental
desire
to
revisit
the
place
where
ten
years
before
he
had
fallen
violently
in
love
with
the
pretty
daughter
of
the
pasteur
leysin
in
whose
house
he
lodged
he
had
gone
there
to
learn
french
the
very
slight
detour
seemed
pardonable
his
spiritless
charge
was
easily
persuaded
we
might
go
home
by
pontarlier
instead
of
bâle
and
get
a
glimpse
of
the
jura
he
suggested
the
line
slides
along
its
frontiers
a
bit
and
then
goes
bang
across
it
we
might
even
stop
off
a
night
on
the
way
if
you
cared
about
it
i
know
a
curious
old
village
villaret
where
i
went
at
your
age
to
pick
up
replied
lord
ernie
listlessly
all
on
the
way
to
paris
ain
t
it
of
course
you
see
there
s
a
fortnight
before
we
need
get
so
there
is
yes
let
s
he
felt
it
was
almost
his
own
idea
and
that
he
decided
it
if
you
d
like
oh
yes
why
not
i
m
sick
of
he
flicked
some
dust
off
his
coat
sleeve
with
an
immaculate
silk
handkerchief
then
lit
a
cigarette
just
as
you
like
he
added
with
a
drawl
and
a
smile
i
m
ready
for
there
was
no
keenness
no
personal
desire
no
choice
in
reality
at
all
flabby
merely
a
suggestion
was
invariably
enough
as
though
the
boy
had
no
will
of
his
own
his
opposition
rarely
more
than
negative
sulking
that
soon
flattened
out
because
it
was
forgotten
indeed
no
sign
of
positive
life
lay
in
him
anywhere
no
vitality
aggression
coherence
of
desire
and
will
vacuous
rather
than
imbecile
unable
to
go
forward
upon
any
definite
line
of
his
own
as
though
all
wheels
had
slipped
their
cogs
a
pasty
soul
that
took
good
enough
impressions
yet
never
mastered
them
for
permanent
use
nothing
stuck
he
would
never
make
a
politician
much
less
a
statesman
the
family
title
would
be
borne
by
a
nincompoop
yet
all
the
machinery
was
there
one
felt
if
only
it
could
be
driven
made
to
go
it
was
sad
lord
ernie
was
heir
to
great
estates
with
a
name
and
position
that
might
influence
thousands
and
hendricks
had
been
a
good
selection
with
his
virility
and
gentle
understanding
firmness
he
understood
the
problem
you
ll
do
what
no
one
else
could
the
anxious
father
told
him
for
he
worships
you
and
you
can
sting
without
hurting
him
you
ll
put
life
and
interest
into
him
if
anybody
in
this
world
can
i
have
great
hopes
of
this
tour
i
shall
always
be
in
your
debt
and
hendricks
had
accepted
the
onerous
duty
in
his
big
way
he
was
conscientious
to
the
backbone
this
little
was
his
sole
deflection
if
such
it
can
be
called
even
life
light
and
cheerful
influences
had
been
his
instructions
nothing
dull
or
melancholy
an
occasional
fling
if
he
wants
it
i
d
welcome
a
fling
as
a
good
sign
and
as
much
intercourse
with
decent
people
and
stimulating
as
you
can
manage
or
can
stand
the
marquess
added
with
a
smile
only
you
won
t
overtax
the
lad
will
you
above
all
let
him
think
chooses
and
decides
when
villaret
however
hardly
complied
with
these
conditions
there
was
melancholy
in
it
hendricks
mind
whose
reflexes
the
spongy
nature
of
the
empty
lad
absorbed
too
easily
would
be
in
a
minor
key
yet
a
night
could
work
no
harm
whence
came
he
wondered
the
fleeting
notion
that
it
might
do
good
was
it
perhaps
that
leysin
the
vigorous
old
pasteur
might
contribute
something
leysin
had
been
a
considerable
force
in
his
own
development
he
remembered
they
had
corresponded
a
little
since
leysin
was
out
of
the
common
certainly
restless
energy
in
him
as
of
the
sea
hendricks
found
difficulty
in
sorting
out
his
thoughts
and
motives
but
leysin
was
in
them
somewhere
this
idea
that
his
energetic
personality
might
help
his
vitalising
effect
at
least
would
counteract
the
melancholy
for
villaret
lay
huddled
upon
unstimulating
slopes
the
robe
of
gloomy
sweeping
down
towards
its
poverty
from
bleak
heights
and
desolate
gorges
the
peasants
were
morose
folk
it
was
a
dark
untaught
corner
in
a
range
of
otherwise
fairy
mountains
a
backwater
the
sun
had
neglected
to
clean
out
superstitions
hendricks
remembered
of
incredible
kind
still
lingered
there
a
touch
of
the
sinister
hovered
about
the
composite
mind
of
its
inhabitants
the
pasteur
fought
strenuously
this
blackness
in
their
lives
and
thoughts
in
the
village
itself
with
more
or
less
success
though
even
there
the
drinking
and
habits
of
living
were
utterly
unsweetened
but
on
the
heights
among
the
somewhat
arid
pastures
the
mountain
men
remained
untamed
turbulent
even
menacing
hendricks
knew
this
of
old
though
he
had
never
understood
too
well
but
he
remembered
how
the
english
boys
at
were
forbidden
to
climb
in
certain
directions
because
the
life
in
these
scattered
châlets
was
somehow
loose
and
violent
there
was
danger
there
the
danger
however
never
definitely
stated
those
lonely
ridges
lay
cursed
beneath
dark
skies
he
remembered
too
the
savage
dogs
the
difficulty
of
approach
the
aggressive
attitude
towards
the
plucky
pasteur
s
visits
to
these
remote
upland
they
did
not
lie
in
his
parish
leysin
made
his
occasional
visits
as
man
and
missionary
for
extraordinary
rumours
hendricks
recalled
were
rife
of
some
queer
worship
of
their
own
these
lawless
peasants
kept
alive
in
their
distant
windy
territory
planted
there
first
the
story
had
it
by
some
renegade
priest
whose
name
was
now
forgotten
hendricks
himself
had
no
personal
experiences
he
had
been
too
deeply
in
love
to
trouble
about
outside
things
however
strange
but
marston
s
case
had
never
quite
left
his
memory
marston
who
climbed
up
by
unlawful
ways
stayed
away
two
whole
days
and
nights
and
came
back
suddenly
with
his
air
of
being
broken
shattered
appallingly
used
up
his
face
so
lined
and
strained
it
seemed
aged
by
twenty
years
and
yet
with
a
singular
new
life
in
him
so
vehement
loud
and
reckless
it
was
like
a
kind
of
sober
intoxication
he
was
packed
off
to
england
before
he
could
relate
anything
but
he
had
suffered
shocks
his
white
passionate
face
his
boisterous
new
vigour
the
way
leysin
screened
his
view
of
the
heights
as
he
put
him
personally
into
the
paris
train
almost
as
though
he
feared
the
boy
would
see
the
hills
and
make
another
dash
for
them
made
up
an
unforgettable
picture
in
the
mind
moreover
between
the
sodden
village
and
that
string
of
evil
châlets
that
lay
in
their
dark
line
upon
the
heights
there
had
been
links
exactly
of
what
nature
he
never
knew
for
love
made
all
else
uninteresting
only
he
remembered
swarthy
messengers
descending
into
the
sleepy
hamlet
from
time
to
time
big
fellows
with
wind
in
their
hair
and
fire
in
their
eyes
that
their
visits
produced
commotion
and
excitement
of
difficult
kinds
that
wild
orgies
invariably
followed
in
their
wake
and
that
when
the
messengers
went
back
they
did
not
go
alone
there
was
life
up
there
whereas
the
village
was
moribund
and
none
who
went
ever
cared
to
return
cudrefin
the
young
giant
taken
in
this
way
from
the
very
side
of
his
sweetheart
too
came
back
two
years
later
as
a
messenger
himself
he
did
not
even
ask
for
the
girl
who
had
meanwhile
married
another
there
s
life
up
there
with
us
he
told
the
drunken
loafers
in
the
guillaume
tell
wind
and
fire
to
make
you
spin
to
the
devil
or
to
heaven
he
was
enthusiasm
personified
in
the
village
he
had
been
merely
drinking
himself
stupidly
to
death
vaguely
too
hendricks
remembered
visits
of
police
from
the
neighbouring
town
some
of
them
on
horseback
all
armed
and
that
once
even
soldiers
accompanied
them
and
on
another
occasion
a
bishop
or
whatever
the
church
dignitary
was
called
had
arrived
suddenly
and
promised
radical
assistance
of
a
spiritual
kind
that
had
never
materialised
oh
and
many
other
details
that
now
trooped
back
with
suggestions
time
had
certainly
not
made
smaller
for
the
love
had
passed
along
its
way
and
gone
and
he
was
free
now
to
the
invasion
of
other
memories
dwarfed
at
the
time
by
that
dominating
sweet
passion
yet
all
the
tutor
wanted
now
this
chance
week
in
late
october
was
to
see
again
the
corner
of
the
mossy
forest
where
he
had
known
that
marvellous
thing
first
love
renew
his
link
with
leysin
who
had
taught
him
much
and
see
if
perchance
this
man
s
stalwart
virile
energy
might
possibly
overflow
with
benefit
into
his
listless
charge
the
expenses
he
meant
to
pay
out
of
his
own
pocket
those
wild
pagans
on
the
heights
even
if
they
still
existed
there
was
no
need
to
mention
lord
ernie
knew
little
french
and
certainly
no
word
of
for
one
night
or
even
two
the
risk
was
negligible
was
there
indeed
risk
at
all
of
any
sort
was
not
this
vague
uneasiness
he
felt
merely
conscience
faintly
pricking
he
could
not
feel
that
he
was
doing
wrong
at
worst
the
youth
might
feel
depression
for
a
few
hours
speedily
curable
by
taking
the
train
something
nevertheless
did
gnaw
at
him
in
subconscious
fashion
producing
a
sense
of
apprehension
and
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
memory
of
the
mountain
tribe
was
the
cause
of
it
a
revival
of
forgotten
boyhood
s
awe
he
glanced
across
at
the
figure
of
bindy
lounging
upon
the
hotel
lawn
in
an
full
in
the
sunshine
a
newspaper
at
his
feet
reclining
there
he
looked
so
big
and
strong
and
handsome
yet
in
reality
was
but
a
painted
lath
without
resistance
much
less
attack
in
all
his
many
inches
and
suddenly
the
tutor
recalled
another
thing
the
link
however
undiscoverable
and
it
was
this
that
the
boy
s
mother
a
canadian
had
suffered
once
severely
from
a
winter
in
quebec
where
the
marquess
had
first
made
her
acquaintance
frost
had
robbed
her
if
he
remembered
rightly
of
a
foot
with
the
result
at
any
rate
that
she
had
a
wholesome
terror
of
the
cold
she
sought
heat
and
sun
instinctively
fire
also
that
asthma
had
been
her
sore
affliction
sheer
inability
to
take
a
full
deep
breath
this
deficiency
of
heat
and
air
therefore
were
in
her
mind
and
he
knew
that
bindy
s
birth
had
been
an
anxious
time
the
anxiety
justified
moreover
since
she
had
yielded
up
her
life
for
him
and
so
the
singular
thought
flashed
through
him
suddenly
as
he
watched
the
reclining
languid
boy
cudrefin
s
descriptive
phrase
oddly
singing
in
his
head
heat
and
fire
fire
and
wind
why
it
s
the
very
thing
he
lacks
and
he
s
always
after
them
i
wonder
ii
the
lumbering
yellow
diligence
brought
them
up
from
the
lake
shore
a
long
two
hours
deposited
them
at
the
opening
of
the
village
street
and
went
its
grinding
toiling
way
towards
the
frontier
they
arrived
in
a
blur
of
rain
it
was
evening
lowering
clouds
drew
night
before
her
time
upon
the
world
obscuring
the
distant
summits
of
the
oberland
but
lights
twinkled
here
and
there
in
the
nearer
landscape
mapping
the
gloom
with
signals
the
village
was
very
still
above
and
below
it
however
two
big
winds
were
at
work
with
curious
results
for
a
lower
wind
from
the
east
in
gusty
draughts
drove
the
body
of
the
lake
into
quick
white
horses
which
shone
like
wings
against
the
deep
while
a
westerly
current
swept
the
heights
immediately
above
the
village
there
was
this
odd
division
of
two
weathers
presaging
a
change
a
narrow
line
of
clear
bright
sky
showed
up
the
jura
outline
finely
towards
the
north
stars
peeping
sharply
through
the
pale
moist
spaces
hurrying
vapours
driven
by
the
upper
westerly
wind
concealed
them
thinly
they
flashed
and
vanished
the
entire
ridge
five
thousand
feet
in
the
air
had
an
appearance
of
moving
through
the
sky
between
these
opposing
winds
at
different
levels
the
village
itself
lay
motionless
while
the
world
slid
past
as
it
were
in
two
directions
the
earth
seems
turning
round
remarked
lord
ernie
he
had
been
reading
a
novel
all
day
in
train
and
steamer
and
smoking
endless
cigarettes
in
the
diligence
his
companion
and
himself
its
only
occupants
he
seemed
suddenly
to
have
waked
up
what
is
it
he
asked
with
interest
hendricks
explained
the
queer
effect
of
the
two
contrary
winds
columns
of
peat
smoke
rose
in
thin
straight
lines
from
the
blur
of
houses
untouched
by
the
careering
currents
above
and
below
the
winds
whirled
round
them
lord
ernie
listened
attentively
to
the
explanation
i
feel
as
if
i
were
spinning
with
it
like
a
top
he
observed
putting
his
hand
to
his
head
a
moment
and
what
are
those
lights
up
there
he
pointed
to
the
distant
ridge
where
fires
were
blazing
as
though
stars
had
fallen
and
set
fire
to
the
trees
several
were
visible
at
regular
intervals
the
sharp
summits
of
the
limestone
mountains
cut
hard
into
the
clear
spaces
of
northern
sky
thousands
of
feet
above
oh
the
peasants
burning
wood
and
stuff
i
suppose
the
tutor
told
him
the
youth
turned
an
instant
standing
still
to
examine
them
with
a
shading
hand
people
live
up
there
he
asked
there
was
surprise
in
his
voice
and
his
body
stiffened
oddly
as
he
spoke
in
mountain
châlets
yes
replied
the
other
a
trifle
impatiently
noticing
his
attitude
come
along
now
he
added
let
s
get
to
our
rooms
in
the
carpenter
s
house
before
the
rain
comes
down
you
can
see
the
windows
twinkling
over
there
and
he
pointed
to
a
building
near
the
church
the
storm
will
catch
they
moved
quickly
down
the
deserted
street
together
in
the
deepening
gloom
passing
little
gardens
doors
of
open
barns
straggling
manure
heaps
and
courtyards
of
cobbled
stones
where
the
occasional
figure
of
a
man
was
seen
but
lord
ernie
lingered
behind
half
loitering
once
or
twice
to
the
other
s
increasing
annoyance
he
paused
standing
still
to
watch
the
heights
through
openings
between
the
old
houses
half
a
dozen
big
drops
of
rain
splashed
heavily
on
the
road
hurry
up
cried
hendricks
looking
back
or
we
shall
be
caught
it
s
the
mountain
wind
the
de
you
can
hear
it
coming
for
the
lad
was
peering
across
a
low
wall
in
an
attitude
of
fixed
attention
he
made
a
gesture
with
one
hand
as
though
he
signalled
towards
the
ridges
where
the
fires
blazed
hendricks
called
pretty
sharply
to
him
then
it
was
possible
of
course
that
he
misinterpreted
the
movement
it
merely
have
been
that
he
passed
his
fingers
through
his
hair
across
his
eyes
or
used
the
palm
to
focus
sight
for
his
hat
was
off
and
the
light
was
quite
uncertain
only
hendricks
did
not
like
the
lingering
or
the
gesture
he
put
authority
into
his
tone
at
once
come
along
will
you
come
along
bindy
he
called
the
answer
filled
him
with
amazement
all
right
all
right
i
ll
follow
in
a
moment
i
like
the
tutor
went
back
a
few
steps
towards
him
the
tone
startled
him
like
what
he
asked
and
lord
ernie
turned
towards
him
with
another
face
there
was
fighting
in
it
there
was
resolution
this
of
course
the
boy
answered
steadily
but
with
excitement
shut
down
behind
as
he
waved
one
arm
towards
the
mountains
i
ve
dreamed
this
sort
of
thing
i
ve
known
it
somewhere
we
ve
seen
nothing
like
it
all
our
stupid
the
flash
in
his
brown
eyes
passed
then
as
he
added
more
quietly
but
with
firmness
don
t
wait
for
me
i
ll
hendricks
stood
still
in
his
tracks
there
was
a
decision
in
the
voice
and
manner
that
arrested
him
the
confidence
the
positive
statement
the
eager
desire
the
hint
of
energy
all
this
was
new
he
had
never
encouraged
the
boy
s
habit
of
vivid
dreaming
deeming
the
narration
unwise
it
flashed
across
him
suddenly
now
that
the
deficiency
might
be
only
on
the
surface
energy
and
life
hid
perhaps
subconsciously
in
him
did
the
dreams
betray
an
activity
he
knew
not
how
to
carry
through
and
correlate
with
his
everyday
external
world
and
were
these
dreams
evidence
of
deep
hidden
desire
a
clue
possibly
to
the
energy
he
sought
and
needed
the
exact
kind
of
energy
that
might
set
the
inert
machinery
in
motion
and
drive
it
he
hesitated
an
instant
waiting
in
the
road
he
was
on
the
verge
of
understanding
something
that
yet
just
evaded
him
bindy
s
childish
instinctive
love
of
fire
his
passion
for
air
for
rushing
wind
for
oceans
of
limitless
there
came
at
that
moment
a
deep
roaring
in
the
mountains
far
away
but
rapidly
approaching
the
ominous
booming
of
it
filled
the
air
the
westerly
wind
descended
by
the
deep
gorges
shaking
the
forests
shouting
as
it
came
clouds
of
white
dust
spiralled
into
the
sky
off
the
upper
roads
spread
into
sheets
like
snow
and
swept
downwards
with
incredible
velocity
the
air
turned
suddenly
cooler
more
big
drops
of
rain
splashed
and
thudded
on
the
roofs
and
road
there
was
a
feeling
of
something
violent
and
instantaneous
about
to
happen
a
sense
almost
of
attack
the
tore
headlong
down
into
the
valley
come
on
man
he
cried
at
the
top
of
his
voice
that
s
the
i
know
it
of
old
it
s
terrific
run
and
he
caught
the
lad
still
lingering
by
the
arm
but
lord
ernie
shook
himself
free
with
an
excitement
almost
violent
i
ve
been
up
there
with
those
great
fires
he
shouted
i
know
the
whole
blessed
thing
but
where
was
it
where
his
face
was
white
eyes
shining
manner
strangely
agitated
big
naked
fellows
who
dance
like
wind
and
rushing
women
of
fire
and
two
things
happened
then
interrupting
the
boy
s
wild
language
the
reached
the
village
and
struck
it
the
houses
shook
the
trees
bent
double
and
the
cloud
of
limestone
dust
painting
the
darkness
white
swept
on
between
hendricks
and
the
boy
with
extraordinary
force
even
separating
them
there
was
a
clatter
of
falling
tiles
of
banging
doors
and
windows
and
then
a
burst
of
icy
rain
that
fell
like
iron
shot
on
everything
raising
actual
spray
the
air
was
in
an
instant
thick
everything
drove
past
roared
trembled
and
secondly
just
in
that
brief
instant
when
man
and
boy
were
separated
there
shot
between
them
with
shadowy
swiftness
the
figure
of
a
man
hatless
with
flying
hair
who
vanished
with
running
strides
into
the
darkness
of
the
village
street
beyond
all
so
rapidly
that
sight
could
focus
the
manner
neither
of
his
coming
nor
of
his
going
hendricks
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
swarthy
elemental
type
of
face
the
swing
of
great
shoulders
the
leap
of
big
loose
limbs
something
rushing
and
elastic
in
the
whole
appearance
but
nothing
he
could
claim
for
definite
detail
the
figure
swept
through
the
dust
and
wind
like
an
animal
and
was
gone
it
was
indeed
only
the
contrast
of
lord
ernie
s
whitened
skin
of
his
graceful
outline
that
enabled
him
to
recall
the
details
that
he
did
the
visage
seemed
to
storm
away
bindy
s
delicate
aristocratic
face
shone
so
pale
and
eager
but
that
a
real
man
had
passed
was
indubitable
for
the
boy
made
a
flurried
movement
as
though
to
follow
hendricks
caught
his
arm
with
a
determined
grip
and
pulled
him
back
who
was
that
who
was
it
lord
ernie
cried
breathlessly
resisting
with
all
his
strength
but
vainly
some
mountain
fellow
of
course
nothing
to
do
with
and
he
dragged
the
boy
after
him
down
the
road
for
a
second
both
seemed
to
have
lost
their
heads
hendricks
certainly
felt
a
gust
of
something
strike
him
into
momentary
consternation
that
was
half
alarm
from
up
there
where
the
fires
are
asked
the
boy
shouting
above
the
wind
and
rain
yes
yes
i
suppose
so
come
along
we
shall
be
soused
are
you
mad
for
bindy
still
held
back
with
all
his
weight
trying
to
turn
round
and
see
hendricks
used
more
force
there
was
almost
a
scuffle
in
the
road
all
right
i
m
coming
i
only
wanted
to
look
a
second
you
needn
t
drag
my
arm
he
ceased
resistance
and
they
lurched
forward
together
but
what
a
chap
he
was
he
went
like
the
wind
did
you
see
the
light
streaming
out
of
him
like
fire
like
what
shouted
hendricks
as
they
dashed
now
through
the
driving
tempest
fire
bawled
the
boy
it
lit
me
up
as
he
passed
fire
that
lights
but
does
not
burn
and
wind
that
blows
the
world
along
button
your
coat
and
run
interrupted
the
other
hurrying
his
pace
and
pulling
the
lad
forcibly
after
him
don
t
twist
you
re
hurting
i
can
run
as
well
as
you
came
back
with
an
energy
bindy
had
never
shown
before
in
his
life
he
was
breathless
panting
charged
with
excitement
still
it
touched
me
as
he
passed
fire
that
lights
but
doesn
t
burn
and
wind
that
blows
the
heart
to
flame
let
me
go
will
you
let
go
my
he
dashed
free
and
away
the
torrential
rain
came
down
in
sheets
now
from
a
windless
sky
for
the
was
already
miles
beyond
them
tearing
across
the
angry
lake
they
reached
the
carpenter
s
house
where
their
lodging
was
soaked
to
the
skin
they
dried
themselves
and
ate
the
light
supper
of
soup
and
omelette
prepared
for
them
ate
it
in
their
lord
ernie
went
to
bed
with
a
bottle
of
rough
stone
he
declared
with
decision
that
he
felt
no
chill
his
excitement
had
somewhat
passed
but
i
say
hendricks
he
remarked
as
he
settled
down
with
his
novel
and
a
cigarette
calmed
and
normal
again
this
a
place
and
a
half
isn
t
it
it
stirs
me
all
up
i
suppose
it
s
the
storm
what
do
think
electrical
state
of
the
air
yes
replied
the
tutor
briefly
soon
afterwards
he
closed
the
shutters
on
the
weather
side
said
and
went
into
his
own
room
to
unpack
the
singular
phrase
bindy
had
used
kept
singing
through
his
head
fire
that
lights
but
doesn
t
burn
and
wind
that
blows
the
heart
to
flame
the
first
time
he
had
said
blows
the
world
where
on
earth
had
the
boy
got
hold
of
such
queer
words
he
still
saw
the
figure
of
that
wild
mountain
fellow
who
had
passed
between
them
with
the
dust
and
wind
and
rain
there
was
confusion
in
the
picture
or
rather
in
his
memory
of
it
perhaps
but
it
seemed
to
him
looking
back
now
that
the
man
in
passing
had
paused
a
second
the
briefest
second
merely
and
had
spoken
or
at
any
rate
had
stared
closely
a
moment
into
bindy
s
face
and
that
some
communication
had
been
between
them
in
that
moment
of
elemental
violence
iii
pasteur
leysin
hendricks
remembered
very
well
even
now
in
his
old
age
he
was
a
vigorous
personality
but
in
his
youth
he
had
been
almost
revolutionary
wild
enough
too
it
was
rumoured
until
he
had
turned
to
god
of
his
own
accord
as
offering
a
larger
field
for
his
strenuous
vitality
the
little
man
was
possessed
of
tireless
life
a
born
leader
of
forlorn
hopes
attack
his
and
heavy
odds
the
conditions
that
he
loved
before
settling
down
in
this
isolated
spot
de
l
église
in
a
protestant
canton
he
had
been
a
missionary
in
remote
pagan
lands
his
horizon
was
a
big
one
he
had
seen
strange
things
an
uncouth
being
with
a
large
head
upon
a
thin
and
wiry
body
supported
by
steely
bowed
legs
he
had
that
courage
which
makes
itself
known
in
advance
of
any
proof
hendricks
slipped
over
to
about
nine
o
clock
and
found
him
in
his
study
lord
ernie
was
asleep
at
least
his
light
was
out
no
sound
or
movement
audible
from
his
room
the
had
swept
the
heavens
of
clouds
stars
shone
brilliantly
the
fires
still
blazed
faintly
upon
the
heights
the
visit
was
not
unexpected
for
hendricks
had
already
sent
a
message
to
announce
himself
and
the
moment
he
sat
down
met
the
pasteur
s
eye
heard
his
voice
and
observed
his
slight
imperious
gestures
he
passed
under
the
influence
of
a
personality
stronger
than
his
own
something
in
leysin
s
atmosphere
stretched
him
lifting
his
horizon
he
had
come
chiefly
he
now
realised
it
to
borrow
help
and
explanation
with
regard
to
lord
ernie
the
events
of
two
hours
before
had
impressed
him
more
than
he
quite
cared
to
own
and
he
wished
to
talk
about
it
but
somehow
he
found
it
difficult
to
state
his
case
no
opening
presented
itself
or
rather
the
pasteur
s
mind
intent
upon
something
of
his
own
was
too
preoccupied
in
reply
to
a
question
presently
the
tutor
gave
a
brief
outline
of
his
present
duties
but
omitted
the
scene
of
excitement
in
the
village
street
for
as
he
watched
the
furrowed
face
in
the
light
of
the
study
lamp
he
realised
both
anxiety
and
spiritual
high
pressure
at
work
below
the
surface
there
he
hesitated
to
intrude
his
own
affairs
at
first
they
discussed
nevertheless
the
psychology
of
the
boy
and
the
unfavourable
chances
of
regeneration
while
the
old
man
s
face
lit
up
and
flashed
from
time
to
time
until
at
length
the
truth
came
out
and
hendricks
understood
his
friend
s
preoccupation
what
you
re
attempting
with
an
individual
leysin
exclaimed
with
ardour
is
precisely
what
i
m
attempting
with
a
crowd
and
it
s
difficult
for
poor
sinners
make
poor
saints
and
the
lukewarm
i
will
spue
out
of
my
he
made
an
abrupt
resentful
gesture
to
signify
his
disgust
and
weariness
perhaps
his
contempt
as
well
cut
it
down
why
cumbereth
it
the
ground
a
hard
uncharitable
doctrine
began
the
tutor
realising
that
he
must
discuss
the
parish
before
he
could
introduce
bindy
s
case
effectively
you
mean
of
course
that
there
s
no
material
to
work
on
no
energy
to
direct
was
the
emphatic
reply
my
sheep
here
are
real
sheep
mere
negative
loafers
without
desire
hospital
cases
i
could
work
with
tigers
and
wild
beasts
but
who
ever
trained
a
slug
your
proper
place
is
on
the
heights
suggested
hendricks
interrupting
at
a
venture
there
s
scope
enough
up
there
or
used
to
be
have
they
died
out
those
wild
men
of
the
mountains
and
hit
by
chance
the
target
in
the
bull
the
old
man
s
face
turned
younger
as
he
answered
quickly
men
like
that
he
exclaimed
do
not
die
off
they
breed
and
he
leaned
forward
across
the
table
his
manner
eager
fervent
almost
impetuous
with
suppressed
desire
for
action
there
s
evil
thinking
up
there
he
said
suggestively
but
by
heaven
it
s
alive
it
s
positive
ambitious
constructive
with
violent
feeling
and
strong
desire
to
work
on
there
s
hope
of
some
result
upon
vehement
impulses
like
that
pagan
or
anything
else
a
man
can
work
with
a
will
those
are
the
tigers
down
here
i
have
the
slugs
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
leaned
back
into
his
chair
hendricks
watched
him
thinking
of
the
stories
told
about
his
missionary
days
among
savage
and
barbarian
tribes
born
of
the
vital
landscape
i
suppose
he
asked
wind
and
frost
and
blazing
sun
their
wild
energy
i
mean
is
due
to
a
gesture
from
the
old
man
stopped
him
you
know
who
started
them
upon
their
wild
performances
he
said
gravely
in
a
lower
voice
you
know
how
that
ambitious
renegade
priest
from
the
valais
chose
them
for
his
nucleus
then
died
before
he
could
lead
them
out
trained
and
competent
upon
his
strange
campaign
you
heard
the
story
when
you
were
with
me
as
a
boy
i
remember
marston
put
in
the
other
uncommonly
interested
marston
the
boy
who
he
stopped
because
he
hardly
knew
how
to
continue
there
was
a
minute
s
silence
but
it
was
not
an
empty
silence
though
no
word
broke
it
leysin
s
face
was
a
study
ah
marston
yes
he
said
slowly
without
looking
up
you
remember
him
but
that
is
at
my
door
too
i
suppose
his
father
was
ignorant
and
obstinate
i
might
have
saved
him
he
seemed
talking
to
himself
rather
than
to
his
listener
pain
showed
in
the
lines
about
the
rugged
mouth
there
was
no
one
you
see
who
knew
how
to
direct
the
great
life
that
woke
in
the
lad
he
took
it
back
with
him
and
turned
it
loose
into
all
manner
of
useless
enterprises
and
the
doctors
mistook
his
abrupt
and
fierce
ambitions
for
for
the
hysteria
which
they
called
the
vestibule
of
lunacy
yet
small
characters
may
have
big
ideas
they
didn
t
understand
of
course
it
was
sad
sad
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
a
moment
marston
went
wrong
then
in
the
end
for
the
other
s
manner
suggested
disaster
of
some
kind
hendricks
asked
it
in
a
whisper
leysin
uncovered
his
face
looped
his
neck
with
one
finger
and
pointed
to
the
ceiling
hanged
himself
murmured
hendricks
shocked
the
pasteur
nodded
but
there
was
impatience
half
anger
in
his
tone
they
checked
it
kept
it
in
of
course
it
tore
him
the
two
men
looked
into
each
other
s
eyes
for
a
moment
and
something
in
the
younger
of
them
shrank
this
was
all
beyond
his
ken
a
little
an
odd
hint
of
bleak
and
cruel
reality
was
in
the
air
making
him
shiver
along
nerves
that
were
normally
inactive
the
uneasiness
he
felt
about
lord
ernie
became
alarm
his
conscience
pricked
him
more
than
he
could
assimilate
continued
leysin
it
broke
him
yet
had
outlets
been
provided
had
he
been
taught
how
to
use
it
this
elemental
energy
drawn
direct
from
nature
he
broke
off
abruptly
struck
perhaps
by
the
expression
in
his
listener
s
eyes
it
seems
incredible
doesn
t
it
in
the
twentieth
century
i
evil
asked
hendricks
stammering
rather
why
evil
was
the
impatient
reply
how
can
any
force
be
evil
that
s
merely
a
question
of
and
the
priest
who
discovered
these
forces
and
taught
their
use
then
was
genuinely
spiritual
and
followed
the
truth
in
his
own
way
he
was
not
necessarily
the
little
pasteur
spoke
with
vehemence
you
talk
like
the
in
the
kindergarten
he
went
on
listen
this
man
sick
and
weary
of
his
lukewarm
flock
sought
vital
stalwart
systems
who
might
be
clean
enough
to
use
the
elemental
powers
he
had
discovered
how
to
attract
only
the
bias
of
the
users
could
make
it
evil
by
wrong
use
his
idea
was
big
and
even
holy
to
train
a
corps
that
might
regenerate
the
world
and
he
chose
unreasoning
unintellectual
types
with
a
purpose
primitive
giant
men
who
could
assimilate
the
force
without
risk
of
being
shattered
under
his
direction
he
intended
they
should
prove
as
effective
as
the
twelve
disciples
of
old
who
were
and
had
he
gone
on
he
too
failed
then
asked
the
other
whose
tangled
thoughts
struggled
with
incredulity
and
belief
as
he
heard
this
strange
new
thing
he
died
you
mean
de
was
the
laconic
reply
padded
cells
and
the
rest
but
still
alive
i
m
told
it
was
more
than
he
could
it
was
a
startling
story
even
in
this
brief
outline
deep
suggestion
in
it
the
tutor
s
sense
of
being
out
of
his
depth
increased
after
nine
months
with
a
lifeless
devitalised
human
being
this
was
well
he
seemed
to
have
fallen
in
his
sleep
from
a
comfortable
bed
into
a
raging
mountain
torrent
strong
currents
rushed
through
and
over
him
the
lonely
peaceful
village
outside
sleeping
beneath
the
stars
heightened
the
contrast
suppressed
or
misdirected
energy
again
i
suppose
he
said
in
a
low
tone
respecting
his
companion
s
emotion
and
these
mountain
men
he
asked
abruptly
do
they
still
keep
up
their
practices
their
ceremonies
yes
corrected
the
other
master
of
himself
again
turbulent
moments
of
nature
storms
and
the
like
stir
them
to
clumsy
rehearsals
of
once
vital
rituals
not
entirely
ineffective
even
in
their
incompleteness
but
dangerous
for
that
very
reason
this
for
instance
invariably
communicates
something
of
its
atmospherical
energy
to
themselves
they
light
their
fires
as
of
old
they
blunder
through
what
they
remember
of
ceremonies
with
the
glasses
you
may
see
them
in
their
dozens
men
and
women
leaping
and
dancing
it
s
an
amazing
sight
great
beauty
in
it
impossible
to
witness
even
from
a
distance
without
feeling
the
desire
to
take
part
in
it
even
my
people
feel
it
the
only
time
they
ever
get
alive
he
jerked
his
big
head
contemptuously
towards
the
street
or
feel
desire
to
act
and
some
one
from
the
heights
a
messenger
perhaps
will
be
down
later
this
very
evening
probably
on
the
hunt
on
the
hunt
hendricks
asked
it
half
below
his
breath
he
felt
a
touch
of
awe
as
he
heard
this
experienced
genuinely
religious
man
speak
with
conviction
of
such
curious
things
on
the
hunt
he
repeated
more
eagerly
messengers
do
come
down
was
the
reply
a
living
belief
always
seeks
to
increase
to
grow
to
add
to
itself
where
there
s
conviction
there
s
always
ah
converts
leysin
shrugged
his
big
black
shoulders
desire
to
add
to
their
number
desire
to
he
said
the
energy
they
absorb
overflows
that
s
the
englishman
debated
several
questions
vaguely
in
his
mind
only
his
mind
being
disturbed
could
not
hold
the
balance
exactly
true
leysin
s
influence
as
of
old
was
upon
him
a
possibility
remote
seductive
dangerous
began
to
beckon
to
him
but
from
somewhere
just
outside
his
reasoning
mind
and
they
always
know
when
one
of
their
kind
is
near
the
voice
slipped
in
between
his
tumbling
thoughts
as
though
they
get
it
instinctively
from
these
universal
elements
they
worship
they
select
their
recruits
with
marvellous
judgment
and
precision
no
messenger
ever
goes
back
alone
nor
has
a
recruit
ever
been
known
to
return
to
the
lazy
squalor
of
the
conditions
whence
he
the
younger
man
sat
upright
in
his
chair
suddenly
alert
and
the
gesture
that
he
made
unconsciously
might
have
been
read
by
a
keen
psychiatrist
as
evidence
of
mental
he
felt
the
forbidden
impulse
in
him
gathering
force
and
tried
to
call
a
halt
at
any
rate
he
called
upon
the
other
man
to
be
explicit
he
enquired
what
this
religion
of
the
heights
might
be
what
were
these
elements
these
people
worshipped
in
what
did
their
wild
ceremonies
consist
and
leysin
breaking
bounds
let
his
speech
burst
forth
in
a
stream
of
explanation
learned
of
actual
knowledge
as
he
claimed
and
uttered
with
a
vehement
conviction
that
produced
an
undeniable
effect
upon
his
astonished
listener
told
by
no
dreamer
but
by
a
righteous
man
who
lived
not
merely
preached
his
certain
faith
hendricks
before
the
half
was
heard
forgot
what
age
and
land
he
dwelt
in
whole
blocks
of
conventional
belief
crumbled
and
fell
away
brick
walls
erected
by
routine
to
mark
narrow
paths
of
proper
conduct
safe
moral
advisable
conduct
thawed
and
vanished
through
the
ruins
scrambling
at
him
from
huge
horizons
never
recognised
before
came
all
manner
of
marvellous
possibilities
the
little
confinement
of
modern
thought
appalled
him
suddenly
leysin
spoke
slowly
said
little
was
not
even
speculative
it
was
no
mere
magic
of
words
that
made
the
study
swim
these
deep
waters
beyond
the
ripple
of
pert
creeds
but
rather
the
overwhelming
sense
of
sure
conviction
driving
behind
the
statements
the
little
man
had
witnessed
curious
things
yes
in
his
missionary
days
and
that
he
had
found
truth
in
them
in
place
of
ignorant
nonsense
was
remarkable
enough
that
silly
superstitions
prevalent
among
older
nations
could
be
signs
really
of
their
former
greatness
linked
mightily
close
to
natural
forces
was
a
startling
notion
but
it
paved
the
way
in
hendricks
receptive
mind
just
then
for
the
belief
that
certain
elements
might
be
worshipped
known
intimately
that
is
to
the
uplifting
advantage
of
the
worshippers
and
what
elements
more
suitable
for
adoring
imitation
than
wind
and
fire
for
in
a
human
body
the
first
signs
of
what
men
term
life
are
heat
which
is
combustion
and
breath
which
is
a
measure
of
wind
life
means
fire
drawn
first
from
the
sun
and
breathing
borrowed
from
the
omnipresent
air
there
might
credibly
be
ways
of
assaulting
these
elements
and
taking
heaven
by
storm
of
seizing
from
their
inexhaustible
stores
an
abnormal
measure
of
straining
this
huge
raw
supply
into
effective
energy
for
human
use
vitality
living
with
fire
and
wind
in
their
most
active
moments
closely
imitating
their
movements
following
in
their
footsteps
understanding
their
laws
of
being
going
with
them
there
lay
a
hint
of
the
method
it
was
once
when
men
were
primitively
close
to
nature
instinctual
knowledge
the
ceremony
was
the
teaching
the
powers
of
fire
the
principalities
of
air
existed
and
humanity
know
their
qualities
by
the
ritual
of
imitation
could
actually
absorb
the
fierce
enthusiasm
of
flame
and
the
tireless
energy
of
wind
such
transference
was
conceivable
leysin
at
any
rate
somehow
made
it
so
his
description
of
what
he
had
personally
witnessed
both
in
wilder
lands
and
here
in
this
little
mountain
range
of
middle
europe
had
a
reality
in
it
that
was
upsetting
to
the
last
degree
there
is
nothing
more
difficult
to
believe
he
said
yet
more
certainly
true
than
the
effect
of
these
singular
elemental
he
laughed
a
short
dry
laugh
the
mediaeval
superstition
that
a
witch
could
raise
a
storm
is
but
a
remnant
of
a
once
completely
efficacious
system
he
concluded
though
how
that
strange
being
the
valais
priest
rediscovered
the
process
and
introduced
it
here
i
have
never
been
able
to
ascertain
that
he
did
so
results
have
proved
at
any
rate
it
lets
in
life
life
moreover
in
astonishing
abundance
though
whether
for
destruction
or
regeneration
depends
obviously
upon
the
use
the
recipient
puts
it
to
that
s
where
direction
comes
the
beckoning
impulse
in
the
tutor
s
bewildered
thoughts
drew
closer
the
moment
for
communicating
it
had
come
at
last
without
more
ado
he
took
the
opening
he
told
his
companion
the
incident
in
the
village
street
the
boy
s
abrupt
excitement
his
energy
the
curious
words
he
used
the
independence
and
vitality
of
his
attitude
he
told
also
of
his
parentage
of
his
mother
s
disabilities
his
craving
for
rushing
air
in
abundance
his
love
of
fire
for
its
own
sake
of
his
magnificent
physical
machinery
yet
of
his
uselessness
and
leysin
as
he
listened
seemed
built
on
wires
searching
questions
shot
forth
like
blows
into
the
other
s
mind
the
pasteur
s
sudden
increase
of
enthusiasm
was
infectious
he
leaped
intuitively
to
the
thing
in
hendricks
thought
he
understood
the
beckoning
the
tutor
answered
the
questions
as
best
he
could
aware
of
the
end
in
view
with
trepidation
and
a
kind
of
mental
breathlessness
yes
unquestionably
bindy
exchanged
communication
of
some
sort
with
the
man
though
his
excitement
had
been
evident
even
sooner
and
you
saw
this
man
yourself
leysin
pressed
him
indubitably
a
tall
and
hurrying
figure
in
the
he
brought
energy
with
him
the
boy
felt
it
and
responded
hendricks
nodded
became
quite
unmanageable
for
some
minutes
he
replied
he
assimilated
it
though
there
was
no
distress
exactly
leysin
asked
sharply
none
that
i
could
see
pleasurable
excitement
something
aggressive
a
rather
wild
enthusiasm
his
will
began
to
act
he
used
that
curious
phrase
about
wind
and
fire
he
turned
alive
he
wanted
to
follow
the
man
and
the
face
how
would
you
describe
it
did
it
bring
terror
i
mean
or
confidence
dark
and
splendid
answered
the
other
as
truthfully
as
he
could
in
a
certain
sense
rushing
tempestuous
yet
stern
a
face
like
the
heights
suggested
leysin
impatiently
a
windy
fiery
aspect
in
it
eh
the
man
swept
past
like
the
spirit
of
a
storm
in
imaginative
poetry
began
the
tutor
hunting
through
his
thoughts
for
adequate
description
then
stopped
as
he
saw
that
his
companion
had
risen
from
his
chair
and
begun
to
pace
the
floor
the
pasteur
paused
a
moment
beside
him
hands
thrust
deep
into
his
pockets
head
bent
down
and
shoulders
forward
for
twenty
seconds
he
stared
into
his
visitor
s
face
intently
as
though
he
would
force
into
him
the
thought
in
his
own
mind
his
features
seemed
working
visibly
yet
behind
a
mask
of
strong
control
don
t
you
see
what
it
is
don
t
you
see
he
said
in
a
lower
deeper
tone
even
from
a
distance
they
were
aware
of
his
coming
he
is
one
of
and
he
straightened
up
again
he
belongs
to
one
of
them
one
of
the
lot
the
tutor
stammered
the
restless
little
man
returned
to
his
chair
opposite
full
of
suppressed
and
vigorous
movement
as
though
he
were
strung
on
springs
he
s
them
he
continued
but
in
a
peculiar
and
particular
sense
more
than
merely
a
possible
recruit
his
empty
organism
would
provide
the
very
link
they
need
the
perfect
he
watched
his
companion
s
face
with
careful
keenness
in
the
country
where
i
first
experienced
this
marvellous
thing
he
added
significantly
he
would
have
been
set
apart
as
the
offering
the
sacrifice
as
they
call
it
there
the
tribe
would
have
chosen
him
with
honour
he
would
have
been
the
special
bait
to
death
whispered
the
other
but
leysin
shook
his
head
in
the
end
perhaps
he
replied
darkly
for
the
vessel
might
be
torn
and
shattered
but
at
first
charged
to
the
brim
and
crammed
with
energy
with
transformed
vitality
they
could
draw
into
themselves
through
him
a
monster
if
you
will
but
to
them
a
deity
and
superhuman
in
our
little
sense
most
then
hendricks
faltered
inwardly
and
turned
away
no
words
came
to
him
at
the
moment
in
silence
the
minds
of
the
two
men
one
a
religious
the
other
a
secular
teacher
and
each
with
a
burden
of
responsibility
to
the
race
kept
pace
together
without
speech
the
religious
however
outstripped
the
pedagogue
what
he
next
said
seemed
a
little
disconnected
with
what
had
preceded
it
although
hendricks
caught
the
drift
easily
enough
and
shuddered
an
organism
needing
heat
observed
leysin
calmly
can
absorb
without
danger
what
would
destroy
a
normal
person
alcohol
again
neither
injures
nor
intoxicates
up
to
a
given
point
the
system
that
really
requires
the
tutor
perplexed
and
sorely
tempted
felt
that
he
drifted
with
a
tide
he
found
it
difficult
to
stem
up
to
a
point
he
repeated
that
s
true
of
up
to
a
given
point
echoed
the
other
with
significance
that
made
his
voice
sound
solemn
then
rescue
in
the
nick
of
he
waited
two
full
minutes
and
more
for
an
answer
then
as
none
was
audible
he
said
another
thing
his
eyes
were
so
intent
upon
the
tutor
s
that
the
latter
raised
his
own
unwillingly
and
understood
thus
all
that
lay
behind
the
pregnant
little
sentence
with
a
number
it
would
not
be
possible
but
with
an
individual
it
could
be
done
brim
the
empty
vessel
first
then
rescue
in
the
nick
of
time
regeneration
iv
in
the
englishman
s
mind
there
came
a
crash
as
though
something
fell
there
was
dust
confusion
noise
moral
platitudes
shouted
at
conventional
admonitions
warnings
laughed
and
maxims
shrivelled
up
above
the
lot
rising
with
a
touch
of
grandeur
stood
the
pulpit
figure
of
the
little
pasteur
his
big
face
shining
clear
through
all
the
turmoil
strength
and
vision
in
the
flaming
eyes
a
commanding
outline
with
spiritual
audacity
in
his
heart
and
hendricks
saw
then
that
the
man
himself
was
standing
erect
in
the
centre
of
the
room
one
finger
raised
to
command
attention
listening
some
considerable
interval
must
have
passed
while
he
struggled
with
his
inner
confusion
leysin
stood
intently
listening
his
big
head
throwing
a
grotesque
shadow
on
wall
and
ceiling
hark
he
exclaimed
half
whispering
do
you
hear
that
a
deep
sound
confused
and
roaring
passed
across
the
night
far
away
and
slightly
booming
it
entered
the
little
room
so
that
the
air
seemed
to
tremble
a
moment
to
hendricks
it
held
something
ominous
the
wind
he
whispered
as
the
noise
died
off
into
the
distance
yet
a
moment
ago
the
night
was
still
enough
the
stars
were
there
was
tense
excitement
in
the
room
just
then
it
showed
in
leysin
s
face
which
had
gone
white
as
a
cloth
hendricks
himself
felt
extraordinarily
stirred
not
wind
but
human
voices
the
older
man
said
quickly
it
s
shouting
listen
and
his
eyes
ran
round
the
room
coming
to
rest
finally
in
a
corner
where
his
hat
and
cloak
hung
from
a
nail
a
gesture
accompanied
the
look
he
wanted
to
be
out
the
tutor
half
rose
to
take
his
leave
you
have
duties
elsewhere
he
stammered
i
m
his
own
instinct
was
to
get
away
himself
with
bindy
by
the
first
early
diligence
he
was
afraid
of
yielding
hush
whispered
leysin
peremptorily
listen
he
opened
the
window
at
the
top
and
through
the
crack
where
the
stars
peeped
brightly
there
came
louder
than
before
the
uproar
of
human
voices
floating
through
the
night
from
far
away
the
air
of
the
great
pine
forests
came
in
with
it
hendricks
listened
intently
a
moment
he
positively
jumped
to
feel
a
hand
upon
his
arm
leysin
s
big
head
was
thrust
close
up
into
his
face
that
s
the
commotion
in
the
village
he
whispered
a
messenger
has
come
and
gone
some
one
has
gone
back
with
him
i
shall
be
needed
down
here
but
night
when
the
great
ritual
takes
place
up
there
hendricks
tried
to
push
him
away
so
as
not
to
hear
the
words
but
the
little
man
seemed
immovable
as
a
rock
the
impulse
remained
probably
in
the
mind
without
making
the
muscles
work
for
the
tutor
sorely
tempted
longed
to
dare
yet
faltered
in
his
will
if
you
felt
like
taking
the
risk
the
words
continued
seductively
we
might
place
the
empty
vessel
near
enough
to
let
it
fill
then
rescue
it
charged
with
energy
in
the
nick
of
and
the
pasteur
s
eyes
were
aglow
with
enthusiasm
his
voice
even
trembling
at
the
thought
of
high
adventure
to
save
another
s
soul
watch
merely
hendricks
heard
his
own
voice
whisper
hardly
aware
that
he
was
saying
it
without
taking
part
he
said
it
thickly
stupidly
a
man
wavering
and
unsure
of
himself
it
would
be
an
experience
he
stammered
i
ve
never
merely
watch
yes
look
on
let
him
see
interrupted
the
other
with
eagerness
we
must
be
very
careful
it
s
worth
trying
a
last
they
still
stood
close
together
hendricks
felt
the
little
man
s
breath
on
his
face
as
he
peered
up
at
him
i
admit
the
chance
he
began
weakly
there
is
no
chance
was
the
vigorous
reply
there
is
only
providence
you
have
been
but
as
to
risk
and
failure
what
of
them
what
s
involved
he
asked
recklessness
increasing
in
him
new
wine
in
old
bottles
was
the
answer
but
here
you
tell
me
the
vessel
is
not
damaged
but
merely
empty
the
machinery
is
all
right
if
he
merely
watches
as
from
a
little
distance
yes
yes
the
machinery
there
i
agree
the
boy
has
breeding
health
and
all
the
physical
qualities
good
blood
and
nerves
and
muscles
it
s
only
that
life
refuses
to
stay
and
drive
his
heart
beat
with
violence
even
as
he
said
it
he
felt
the
energy
and
zeal
from
the
older
man
pour
into
him
he
was
realising
in
himself
on
a
smaller
scale
what
might
take
place
with
the
boy
in
large
but
still
he
shrank
leysin
for
the
moment
said
no
more
his
spiritual
discernment
was
equal
to
his
boldness
having
planted
the
seed
he
left
it
to
grow
or
die
the
decision
was
not
for
him
in
the
light
of
the
single
lamp
the
two
men
sat
facing
each
other
listening
waiting
while
leysin
talked
occasionally
but
in
the
main
kept
silence
some
time
passed
though
how
long
the
tutor
could
not
say
in
his
mind
was
wild
confusion
how
could
he
justify
such
a
mad
proposal
yet
how
could
he
refuse
the
opening
preposterous
though
it
seemed
the
enticement
was
very
great
temptation
rushed
upon
him
striving
to
recall
his
normal
world
he
found
it
difficult
the
face
of
the
old
marquess
seemed
a
mere
lifeless
picture
on
a
wall
it
watched
but
could
not
interfere
here
was
an
opportunity
to
take
or
leave
he
fought
the
battle
in
terms
of
naked
souls
while
the
ordinary
morality
hid
its
face
awhile
he
heard
himself
explaining
delaying
hedging
with
the
problem
but
the
redemption
of
a
soul
was
at
stake
and
he
tried
to
forget
the
environment
and
conditions
of
modern
thought
and
belief
sentences
flashed
at
him
out
of
the
battle
i
must
take
him
back
worse
than
when
i
started
or
what
a
violent
being
like
marston
or
a
redeemed
converted
system
with
new
energy
it
s
a
chance
and
my
moreover
odd
detail
there
was
the
support
of
the
church
of
a
protestant
clergyman
whose
fundamental
beliefs
were
similar
to
the
evangelical
persuasions
of
the
boy
s
family
conversion
as
demoniacal
possession
were
both
traditions
of
the
blood
after
all
the
old
marquess
might
understand
and
approve
you
took
the
opening
god
set
in
your
way
in
his
wisdom
you
showed
faith
and
courage
far
be
it
from
me
to
condemn
the
picture
on
the
wall
looked
down
at
him
and
spoke
the
words
the
wild
hypothesis
of
the
intrepid
little
swept
him
with
an
effect
like
hypnotism
then
suddenly
something
in
him
seemed
to
decide
finally
for
itself
he
flung
himself
morality
and
all
upon
this
vigorous
other
personality
he
leaned
across
the
table
his
face
close
to
the
lamp
his
voice
shook
as
he
spoke
would
he
asked
then
knew
the
question
foolish
and
that
such
a
man
would
shrink
from
nothing
where
the
redemption
of
a
soul
was
at
stake
knew
also
that
the
question
was
proof
that
his
own
decision
was
already
made
there
was
something
grotesque
almost
in
the
torrent
of
colloquial
french
leysin
proceeded
to
pour
forth
while
the
other
sat
listening
in
amazement
half
ashamed
and
half
exhilarated
he
looked
at
the
stalwart
figure
the
wiry
bowed
legs
as
he
paced
the
floor
the
shortness
of
the
and
the
absence
of
round
the
powerful
lean
wrists
it
was
a
great
fighting
man
he
watched
a
man
afraid
of
nothing
in
heaven
or
earth
prepared
to
lead
a
forlorn
hope
into
a
hostile
unknown
land
and
the
sight
combined
with
what
he
heard
set
the
seal
upon
his
decision
he
would
take
the
risk
and
go
pfui
exclaimed
the
little
pasteur
as
though
it
might
have
been
an
oath
his
loud
whisper
breaking
through
into
a
guttural
sound
pfui
bah
would
that
people
had
machinery
like
that
so
that
i
could
use
it
i
ve
no
material
to
work
on
no
force
to
direct
nothing
but
heavy
sodden
clay
jelly
he
cried
negative
useless
lukewarm
stuff
at
he
lowered
his
voice
suddenly
so
as
to
listen
at
the
same
time
i
might
as
well
be
a
baker
kneading
dough
he
continued
they
drink
and
yield
and
drink
again
they
never
attack
and
drive
they
re
not
worth
labouring
to
he
struck
the
wooden
table
with
his
fist
making
the
lamp
rattle
while
his
listener
started
and
drew
back
what
good
can
weak
souls
though
spotless
be
to
god
the
best
have
long
ago
gone
up
to
them
and
he
jerked
his
leonine
old
head
towards
the
mountains
where
there
s
there
s
hope
he
stamped
his
foot
as
he
said
it
but
the
lukewarm
pfui
i
will
spue
them
out
of
my
mouth
he
paused
by
the
window
a
moment
listened
attentively
then
resumed
his
pacing
to
and
fro
clearly
he
longed
for
action
indifference
had
no
place
in
his
composition
and
hendricks
felt
his
own
slower
blood
take
fire
as
he
listened
ah
cried
leysin
louder
what
a
battle
i
could
fight
up
there
for
god
could
i
but
live
among
them
stem
the
flow
of
their
dark
strong
vitality
then
twist
it
round
and
up
up
up
and
he
jerked
his
finger
skywards
it
s
the
great
sinners
we
want
not
the
saints
there
s
energy
enough
among
those
devils
to
bring
a
whole
canton
to
the
great
footstool
could
i
but
direct
he
paused
a
moment
standing
over
his
astonished
visitor
bring
the
boy
up
with
you
and
let
him
drink
his
fill
and
pray
pray
i
say
that
he
become
a
violent
sinner
first
in
order
that
later
there
shall
be
something
worth
offering
to
god
over
one
that
repenteth
a
rapid
nervous
knocking
interrupted
the
flow
of
words
and
the
figure
of
a
woman
stood
upon
the
threshold
with
the
opening
of
the
door
came
also
again
the
roaring
from
the
night
outside
hendricks
saw
the
tall
somewhat
dishevelled
outline
of
the
wife
he
remembered
her
vaguely
though
she
could
hardly
see
him
now
in
his
darker
corner
and
recalled
the
fact
that
she
had
been
sent
out
to
leysin
in
his
missionary
days
a
worthy
illiterate
but
adoring
woman
she
wore
a
shawl
her
hair
was
untidy
her
eyes
fixed
and
staring
her
husband
s
sturdy
little
figure
as
he
rose
stood
level
with
her
chin
you
hear
it
jules
she
whispered
thickly
the
has
brought
them
down
you
ll
be
needed
in
the
she
said
it
anxiously
though
hendricks
understood
the
with
difficulty
they
talked
excitedly
together
a
moment
in
the
doorway
their
outlines
blocked
against
the
corridor
where
a
single
oil
lamp
flickered
she
warned
urging
something
he
expostulated
fragments
reached
hendricks
in
his
corner
clearly
the
woman
worshipped
her
husband
like
a
king
yet
feared
for
his
safety
he
for
his
part
comforted
her
scolded
a
little
argued
told
her
to
believe
in
god
and
go
back
to
they
ll
take
you
too
and
you
ll
never
return
it
s
not
your
parish
anyhow
a
touch
of
anguish
in
her
tone
but
leysin
was
impatient
to
be
off
he
led
her
down
the
passage
my
parish
is
wherever
i
can
help
i
belong
to
god
nothing
can
harm
me
but
to
leave
undone
the
work
he
gives
the
steps
went
farther
away
as
he
guided
her
to
the
stairs
outside
the
roar
of
voices
rose
and
fell
wind
brought
the
drifting
sound
wind
carried
it
away
it
was
like
the
thunder
of
the
sea
and
the
englishman
using
the
little
scene
as
a
flashlight
upon
his
own
attitude
saw
it
for
an
instant
as
god
might
have
seen
it
leysin
s
point
of
view
was
high
scanning
a
very
wide
horizon
his
eye
being
single
the
whole
body
was
full
of
light
the
risk
it
suddenly
seemed
was
nothing
to
shirk
it
indeed
the
merest
cowardice
he
went
up
and
seized
the
pasteur
s
hand
he
said
a
trifle
shakily
perhaps
yet
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
if
we
stay
over
i
ll
bring
the
lad
with
me
provided
he
comes
you
will
stay
over
interrupted
the
other
with
decision
come
to
supper
at
seven
come
in
mountain
boots
use
persuasion
but
not
force
he
shall
see
it
from
a
distance
without
taking
from
a
distance
yes
the
tutor
repeated
but
without
taking
i
know
the
signs
the
pasteur
broke
in
significantly
we
can
rescue
him
in
the
nick
of
time
charged
with
energy
and
life
yet
before
the
danger
gets
a
sudden
clangour
of
bells
drowned
the
whispering
voice
cutting
the
sentence
in
the
middle
it
was
like
an
alarm
of
fire
leysin
sprang
sharply
round
the
signal
he
cried
the
signal
from
the
church
some
one
s
been
taken
i
must
go
at
once
i
shall
be
he
had
his
hat
and
cloak
on
in
a
moment
was
through
the
passage
and
into
the
street
hendricks
following
at
his
heels
the
whole
place
seemed
alive
yet
the
roadway
was
deserted
and
no
lights
showed
at
the
windows
of
the
houses
only
from
the
farther
end
of
the
village
where
stood
the
cabaret
came
a
roar
of
voices
shouting
crying
singing
the
impression
was
that
the
population
was
centred
there
far
in
the
starry
sky
a
line
of
fires
blazed
upon
the
heights
throwing
a
lurid
reflection
above
the
deep
black
valley
excitement
filled
the
night
but
how
extraordinary
exclaimed
hendricks
hurrying
to
overtake
his
alert
companion
what
life
there
is
about
everything
s
on
the
they
went
faster
almost
running
i
feel
the
waves
of
it
beating
even
he
followed
breathlessly
a
messenger
has
come
and
gone
replied
leysin
in
a
sharp
decided
voice
what
you
feel
here
is
but
the
overflow
this
is
the
aftermath
i
must
work
down
here
with
my
people
i
ll
work
with
you
began
the
other
but
leysin
stopped
him
keep
yourself
for
night
up
there
he
said
with
grave
authority
pointing
to
the
fiery
line
upon
the
heights
and
at
the
same
time
quickening
his
pace
along
the
street
at
the
moment
he
cried
looking
back
your
place
is
he
jerked
his
head
towards
the
carpenter
s
house
among
the
vineyards
the
next
minute
he
was
gone
v
and
hendricks
accredited
tutor
to
a
sprig
of
nobility
in
the
twentieth
century
asked
himself
suddenly
how
such
things
could
possibly
be
the
adventure
took
on
abruptly
a
touch
of
nightmare
only
the
light
in
the
sky
above
the
cabaret
windows
and
the
roar
of
voices
where
men
drank
and
sang
brought
home
the
reality
of
it
all
with
a
shudder
of
apprehension
he
glanced
at
the
lurid
glare
upon
the
mountains
he
was
committed
now
not
because
he
had
merely
promised
but
because
he
had
definitely
made
up
his
mind
lighting
a
match
he
saw
by
his
watch
that
the
visit
had
lasted
over
two
hours
it
was
after
eleven
he
hurried
letting
himself
in
with
the
big
and
going
on
tiptoe
up
the
granite
stairs
in
his
mind
rose
a
picture
of
the
boy
as
he
had
known
him
all
these
weary
months
the
mild
brown
eyes
the
facile
indolence
the
pliant
watery
emotions
of
the
listless
creature
but
behind
him
now
like
storm
clouds
the
hopes
desires
fears
the
pasteur
s
talk
had
conjured
up
the
yearning
to
save
stirred
strongly
in
his
heart
and
more
and
more
of
the
little
man
s
reckless
spiritual
audacity
came
with
it
his
own
affection
for
the
lad
was
genuine
but
impatience
and
adventure
pushed
eagerly
through
the
tenderness
if
only
oh
if
only
he
could
put
life
into
that
great
frame
some
energy
as
of
fire
and
wind
into
that
inert
machinery
of
mind
and
body
the
idea
was
utterly
incredible
but
surely
no
harm
could
come
of
trying
the
experiment
there
the
huge
and
elemental
forces
of
course
in
nature
and
if
a
sound
in
the
bedroom
as
he
crept
softly
past
the
door
caught
his
attention
and
he
paused
a
moment
to
listen
lord
ernie
was
not
asleep
then
after
all
he
wondered
why
the
sound
got
somehow
at
his
heart
there
was
shuffling
behind
the
door
there
was
a
voice
too
or
was
it
voices
he
knocked
who
is
it
came
at
once
in
a
tone
he
hardly
recognised
and
as
he
answered
it
s
i
hendricks
let
me
in
there
followed
a
renewal
of
the
shuffling
but
without
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
door
flew
open
it
was
not
even
locked
lord
ernie
stood
before
him
dressed
to
go
out
in
the
faint
starlight
the
tall
ungainly
figure
filled
the
doorway
erect
and
huge
the
shoulders
squared
the
trunk
no
longer
drooping
the
listlessness
was
gone
he
stood
upright
limbs
straight
and
alert
the
sagging
limp
had
vanished
from
the
knees
he
looked
in
this
like
another
person
almost
monstrous
and
the
tutor
drew
back
instinctively
catching
an
instant
at
his
breath
but
my
dear
boy
why
aren
t
you
asleep
he
stammered
he
glanced
half
nervously
about
him
i
heard
you
talking
surely
he
fumbled
for
a
match
but
before
he
found
it
the
other
had
turned
on
the
electric
switch
the
light
flared
out
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
is
anything
wrong
with
you
what
s
the
matter
but
the
boy
answered
quietly
though
in
a
deeper
voice
than
hendricks
had
ever
known
in
him
before
i
m
all
right
only
i
couldn
t
sleep
i
ve
been
watching
those
fires
on
the
mountains
i
i
wanted
to
go
out
and
he
still
held
the
in
his
hand
swinging
them
vigorously
by
the
strap
the
room
was
littered
with
clothes
just
unpacked
the
heavy
shooting
boots
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
hendricks
noticing
these
signs
felt
a
wave
of
excitement
sweep
through
him
caught
somehow
from
the
presence
of
the
boy
there
was
a
sense
of
vitality
in
the
room
as
though
a
rush
of
active
movement
had
just
passed
through
it
both
windows
stood
wide
open
and
the
roar
of
voices
was
clearly
audible
lord
ernie
turned
his
head
to
listen
that
s
only
the
village
people
drinking
and
shouting
said
hendricks
closely
watching
each
movement
that
he
made
it
s
perfectly
natural
bindy
that
you
feel
too
excited
to
sleep
we
re
in
the
mountains
the
air
stimulates
tremendously
it
makes
the
heart
beat
he
decided
not
to
press
the
lad
with
questions
but
i
never
felt
like
this
in
the
rockies
or
the
himalayas
came
the
swift
rejoinder
as
he
moved
to
the
window
and
looked
out
there
was
nothing
in
india
or
japan
like
he
swept
his
hand
towards
the
wooded
heights
that
towered
above
the
village
so
close
he
talked
volubly
all
those
things
we
saw
out
there
were
sham
done
on
purpose
for
tourists
up
there
it
s
real
i
ve
been
watching
through
the
glasses
till
i
felt
i
simply
must
go
out
and
join
it
you
can
see
men
dancing
round
the
fires
and
big
rushing
women
oh
hendricks
isn
t
it
all
glorious
all
too
glorious
and
ripping
for
words
and
his
brown
eyes
shone
like
lamps
you
mean
that
it
s
spontaneous
natural
the
other
guided
him
welcoming
the
new
enthusiasm
yet
still
bewildered
by
the
startling
change
it
was
not
mere
nerves
he
saw
there
was
nothing
morbid
in
it
they
re
doing
it
i
mean
because
they
have
to
came
the
decided
answer
and
because
they
feel
it
they
re
not
just
copying
the
he
put
his
hand
upon
the
other
s
arm
there
was
dry
heat
in
it
that
hendricks
felt
even
through
his
clothes
and
that
s
what
want
the
boy
went
on
raising
his
voice
what
i
ve
always
wanted
without
knowing
it
real
things
that
can
make
me
alive
i
ve
often
had
it
in
my
dreams
you
know
but
now
i
ve
found
but
i
didn
t
know
you
never
told
me
of
those
the
boy
s
cheeks
flushed
so
that
the
colour
and
the
fire
in
his
eyes
made
him
positively
splendid
he
answered
slowly
as
out
of
some
part
he
had
hitherto
kept
deliberately
concealed
because
i
never
could
get
hold
of
it
in
words
it
sounded
so
silly
even
to
myself
and
i
thought
father
would
train
it
all
away
and
laugh
at
it
it
s
awfully
far
down
in
me
but
it
s
so
real
i
knew
it
must
come
out
one
day
and
that
i
should
find
it
oh
i
say
hendricks
and
he
lowered
his
voice
leaning
out
across
the
suddenly
fills
me
up
and
feeds
me
he
pointed
to
the
heights
and
gives
me
life
the
life
i
ve
seen
till
now
was
only
a
kind
of
show
it
starved
me
i
want
to
go
up
there
and
feel
it
pouring
through
my
he
filled
his
lungs
with
the
strong
mountain
air
and
paused
while
he
exhaled
it
slowly
as
though
tasting
it
with
delight
and
understanding
then
he
burst
out
again
i
vote
we
go
will
you
come
with
me
what
d
you
say
eh
they
stared
at
each
other
hard
a
moment
something
as
primitive
and
irresistible
as
love
passed
through
the
air
between
them
with
a
great
effort
the
older
man
kept
the
balance
true
not
not
now
he
said
firmly
it
s
too
late
if
you
like
with
but
cried
the
boy
with
a
rush
when
the
fires
are
blazing
and
the
wind
is
loose
not
in
the
stupid
all
right
night
and
my
old
friend
monsieur
leysin
shall
be
our
guide
he
knows
the
way
and
he
knows
the
people
lord
ernie
seized
his
hands
with
enthusiasm
his
vigour
was
so
disconcerting
that
it
seemed
to
affect
his
physical
appearance
the
body
grew
almost
visibly
his
very
clothes
hung
on
him
differently
he
was
no
longer
a
nonentity
yawning
beneath
an
ancient
pedigree
and
title
he
was
an
aggressive
personality
the
boy
in
him
rushed
into
manhood
as
it
were
while
still
retaining
boyish
speech
and
gesture
it
was
uncanny
we
ll
go
more
than
once
i
vote
go
again
and
again
this
a
place
and
a
half
it
s
place
with
a
vengeance
not
exactly
the
kind
of
place
your
father
would
wish
you
to
linger
in
his
tutor
interrupted
but
we
might
stay
a
day
or
two
especially
as
you
like
it
it
s
far
better
than
the
towns
and
the
rotten
embassies
better
than
fifty
simlas
and
bombays
and
filthy
cairos
cried
the
other
eagerly
it
s
just
the
thing
i
need
and
when
i
get
home
i
ll
show
em
something
i
ll
prove
it
why
they
simply
won
t
know
me
he
laughed
and
his
face
shone
with
a
kind
of
vivid
radiance
in
the
glare
of
the
electric
light
the
transformation
was
more
than
curious
waiting
a
moment
to
see
if
more
would
follow
hendricks
moved
slowly
then
towards
the
door
with
the
remark
that
it
was
advisable
now
to
go
to
bed
since
they
would
be
up
late
the
following
night
when
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
the
pillow
and
sheets
were
crumpled
and
that
the
bed
had
already
been
lain
in
the
first
suspicion
flashed
back
upon
him
with
new
certainty
lord
ernie
was
already
taking
off
his
heavy
coat
preparatory
to
undressing
he
looked
up
quickly
at
the
altered
tone
of
voice
bindy
the
tutor
said
with
a
touch
of
gravity
you
alone
just
now
weren
t
you
of
course
the
other
sat
up
from
stooping
over
his
boots
with
his
hands
resting
on
the
bed
behind
him
he
looked
straight
into
his
companion
s
eyes
lying
was
not
among
his
faults
he
answered
slowly
after
a
decided
interval
i
i
was
asleep
he
whispered
evidently
trying
to
be
accurate
yet
hesitating
how
to
describe
the
thing
he
had
to
say
and
had
a
dream
one
of
my
real
vivid
dreams
when
something
happens
only
this
time
it
was
more
real
than
ever
before
it
was
he
paused
searching
for
words
then
added
sweet
and
and
hendricks
repeated
the
surprising
sentence
sweet
and
awful
bindy
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
boy
lord
ernie
seemed
puzzled
himself
by
the
choice
of
words
he
used
i
don
t
know
exactly
he
went
on
honestly
only
i
mean
that
it
was
awfully
real
and
splendid
a
bit
of
my
own
life
somewhere
somewhere
else
where
it
lies
hidden
away
behind
a
lot
of
days
and
months
that
choke
it
up
i
can
never
get
at
it
except
in
woods
and
places
quite
alone
hearing
the
wind
or
making
fires
or
in
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
a
moment
then
looked
up
with
a
hint
of
censure
in
his
eyes
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
that
such
things
done
you
never
told
me
he
repeated
i
didn
t
know
it
myself
until
this
evening
leysin
i
thought
you
knew
everything
lord
ernie
broke
in
in
that
same
tone
monsieur
leysin
told
me
for
the
first
time
said
hendricks
firmly
that
such
people
and
such
practices
existed
till
now
i
had
never
dreamed
that
such
superstitions
survived
anywhere
in
the
world
at
he
resented
the
reproach
but
he
was
also
aware
that
the
boy
resented
his
authority
for
the
first
time
his
ascendency
seemed
in
question
his
voice
his
eye
his
manner
did
not
quell
as
formerly
so
you
mean
when
you
say
sweet
and
awful
that
it
was
very
real
to
you
he
asked
he
insisted
now
with
purpose
is
that
it
bindy
the
other
replied
eagerly
enough
yes
that
s
it
i
think
partly
this
time
it
was
more
than
dreaming
it
was
real
i
got
there
i
remembered
that
s
what
i
meant
and
after
i
woke
up
the
thing
still
went
on
the
man
seemed
still
in
the
room
beside
the
bed
calling
me
to
get
up
and
go
with
him
man
what
man
the
tutor
leant
upon
the
back
of
a
chair
to
steady
himself
the
wind
just
then
went
past
the
open
windows
with
a
singing
rush
the
dark
man
who
passed
us
in
the
village
and
who
pointed
to
the
fires
on
the
heights
he
came
with
the
wind
you
remember
he
pulled
my
the
boy
stood
up
as
he
said
it
he
came
across
the
naked
boarding
his
step
light
and
dancing
fire
that
heats
but
does
not
burn
and
wind
that
blows
the
heart
alight
or
something
i
forget
now
exactly
heard
it
he
whispered
the
words
with
excitement
raising
his
arms
and
knees
as
in
the
opening
movements
of
a
dance
hendricks
kept
his
own
excitement
down
but
with
a
distinctly
conscious
effort
i
heard
nothing
of
the
kind
he
said
calmly
i
was
only
thinking
of
getting
home
dry
you
say
he
asked
with
decision
that
you
those
words
lord
ernie
stood
back
a
little
it
was
not
that
he
wished
to
conceal
but
that
he
felt
uncertain
how
to
express
himself
in
the
street
he
said
i
heard
nothing
the
words
rose
up
in
my
own
head
as
it
were
but
in
the
dream
and
afterwards
too
when
i
was
wide
awake
i
heard
them
out
loud
clearly
fire
that
heats
but
does
not
burn
and
wind
that
blows
the
heart
to
flame
that
s
how
it
in
french
bindy
you
heard
it
in
french
oh
it
was
no
language
at
all
the
eyes
said
it
both
he
spoke
as
naturally
as
though
it
was
the
durbah
he
described
again
only
this
new
aggressive
certainty
was
in
his
voice
and
manner
mr
hendricks
he
went
on
eagerly
understand
what
i
mean
don
t
you
when
certain
people
look
at
one
words
start
up
in
the
mind
as
though
one
heard
them
spoken
i
heard
the
words
in
my
head
i
suppose
only
they
seemed
so
familiar
as
though
i
d
known
them
before
always
of
course
bindy
i
understand
but
this
man
tell
me
did
he
stay
on
after
you
woke
up
and
how
did
he
go
he
looked
round
at
the
barely
furnished
room
for
it
was
really
the
dream
you
carried
on
after
waking
wasn
t
it
then
bindy
laughed
but
inwardly
as
to
himself
there
was
the
faintest
possible
hint
of
derision
in
his
voice
no
doubt
he
said
only
it
was
one
of
my
big
real
dreams
and
how
he
went
i
can
t
explain
at
all
for
i
didn
t
see
you
knocked
at
the
door
i
turned
and
found
myself
standing
in
the
room
dressed
to
go
out
there
was
a
rush
of
wind
outside
the
window
and
when
i
looked
he
was
no
longer
there
the
same
minute
you
came
in
it
was
all
as
quick
as
that
i
suppose
i
dressed
in
my
they
stood
for
several
minutes
staring
at
each
other
without
speaking
the
tutor
hesitated
between
several
courses
of
action
unable
for
the
life
of
him
to
decide
upon
any
particular
one
his
instinct
on
the
whole
was
to
stop
nothing
but
to
encourage
all
possible
expression
while
keeping
rigorous
watch
and
guard
repression
it
seemed
to
him
just
then
was
the
least
desirable
line
to
take
somewhere
there
was
truth
in
the
affair
he
felt
out
of
his
depth
his
authority
impaired
and
under
these
temporary
disadvantages
he
might
so
easily
make
a
grave
mistake
injuring
instead
of
helping
while
lord
ernie
finished
his
undressing
he
leaned
out
of
the
window
taking
great
draughts
of
the
keen
night
air
watching
the
blazing
fires
and
listening
to
the
roar
of
voices
now
dying
down
into
the
distance
and
the
voice
of
his
thinking
whispered
to
him
let
it
all
come
out
repress
nothing
let
him
have
the
entire
adventure
if
it
s
nonsense
it
can
t
injure
and
if
it
s
true
it
s
he
drew
his
head
in
and
moved
towards
the
door
then
it
s
settled
he
said
quietly
as
though
nothing
unusual
had
happened
we
ll
go
up
there
night
with
monsieur
leysin
to
show
us
the
way
and
you
ll
go
to
sleep
now
won
t
you
for
we
may
be
up
very
late
promise
me
i
m
dead
tired
came
the
answer
from
the
sheets
i
certainly
shan
t
dream
any
more
if
that
s
what
you
mean
i
hendricks
turned
the
light
out
and
went
softly
from
the
room
he
could
always
trust
the
boy
bindy
he
said
came
the
drowsy
reply
upstairs
he
lingered
a
long
time
over
his
own
undressing
listening
waiting
watching
for
the
least
sound
below
but
nothing
happened
once
for
his
own
peace
of
mind
he
stole
stealthily
downstairs
to
the
boy
s
door
then
reassured
by
the
heavy
breathing
that
was
distinctly
audible
he
went
up
finally
and
got
into
bed
himself
the
night
was
very
still
now
it
was
cool
and
the
stars
were
brilliant
over
lake
and
forest
and
mountain
no
voices
broke
the
silence
he
only
heard
the
tinkle
of
the
little
streams
beyond
the
vineyards
and
by
midnight
he
was
sound
asleep
vi
and
next
day
broke
as
soft
and
brilliant
as
though
october
had
stolen
it
from
june
the
alps
gleamed
through
an
almost
summery
haze
across
the
lake
the
air
held
no
hint
of
coming
winter
and
the
jura
mountains
wore
the
true
blue
of
memory
in
hendricks
mind
patches
of
red
and
yellow
splashed
the
great
here
and
there
where
beech
and
ash
put
autumn
in
the
vast
dark
carpet
the
tutor
woke
and
refreshed
all
that
had
happened
the
night
before
seemed
out
of
proportion
and
unreasonable
there
had
been
exaggerated
emotion
in
it
in
himself
because
he
returned
to
a
place
still
charged
with
potent
memories
of
youth
and
in
lord
ernie
because
the
lad
was
overwrought
by
the
electrical
disturbance
of
the
atmosphere
the
nearness
of
the
ancestral
halls
which
they
both
disliked
had
emphasised
it
the
ominous
wild
weather
had
favoured
it
and
the
coincidence
of
these
pagan
rites
of
superstitious
peasants
had
focused
it
all
into
a
melodramatic
form
with
an
added
touch
of
the
supernatural
that
was
highly
picturesque
and
dangerously
suggestive
hendricks
recovered
his
common
sense
judgment
asserted
itself
again
yet
for
all
that
certain
things
remained
authentic
the
effect
upon
the
boy
was
not
illusion
nor
his
words
about
fire
and
wind
mere
meaningless
invention
there
hid
some
undivined
and
significant
correspondence
between
the
gaps
in
his
deficient
nature
and
these
two
turbulent
elements
the
talk
with
leysin
as
the
conduct
of
his
wife
remained
authentic
those
facts
were
too
steady
to
be
dismissed
the
pasteur
too
genuinely
in
earnest
to
be
catalogued
in
dream
neither
daylight
nor
common
sense
could
dissipate
their
actuality
truth
lay
somewhere
in
it
all
thus
the
day
for
the
tutor
was
a
battle
that
shifted
with
varying
fortune
between
doubt
and
certainty
in
the
morning
his
mind
was
decided
the
wild
experiment
was
unjustifiable
in
the
afternoon
as
the
sunshine
grew
faint
and
melancholy
it
became
interesting
for
what
harm
could
come
of
it
but
towards
evening
when
shadows
lengthened
across
the
purple
forests
and
the
trees
stood
motionless
in
the
calm
and
windless
air
the
adventure
seemed
as
it
had
seemed
the
night
before
not
only
justifiable
but
right
and
necessary
it
only
became
inevitable
however
when
after
tea
together
on
the
balcony
lord
ernie
mentioning
the
subject
for
the
first
time
that
day
asked
pointedly
what
time
the
pasteur
expected
them
to
supper
then
noticing
the
flash
of
hesitancy
in
his
companion
s
eyes
added
in
his
strange
deep
voice
you
promised
we
should
withdrawal
after
that
was
out
of
the
question
to
retract
would
have
meant
for
one
thing
final
loss
of
the
boy
s
confidence
a
possibility
not
to
be
contemplated
for
a
moment
until
this
moment
no
word
of
the
preceding
night
had
passed
the
lips
of
either
lord
ernie
had
been
quiet
and
preoccupied
silent
rather
but
never
listless
he
was
peaceful
perhaps
subdued
a
little
yet
with
a
suppressed
energy
in
his
bearing
that
hendricks
watched
with
secret
satisfaction
the
tutor
closely
observant
detected
nothing
out
of
gear
life
stirred
strongly
in
him
there
was
purpose
interest
will
there
was
desire
but
there
was
nothing
to
cause
alarm
availing
himself
then
of
the
lad
s
absorption
in
his
own
affairs
he
wandered
forth
alone
upon
his
sentimental
tour
of
inspection
no
ghost
of
emotion
rose
to
stalk
beside
him
that
early
tragedy
he
now
saw
clearly
had
been
no
more
than
youthful
explosion
of
mere
physical
passion
wholesome
and
natural
but
due
chiefly
to
propinquity
his
thoughts
ran
idly
on
and
he
was
even
congratulating
himself
upon
escape
and
freedom
when
abruptly
he
remembered
a
phrase
bindy
had
used
the
night
before
and
stumbled
suddenly
upon
a
clue
when
least
expecting
it
he
came
to
a
sudden
halt
the
significance
of
it
crashed
through
his
mind
and
startled
him
there
are
big
rushing
women
it
was
the
first
reference
to
the
other
sex
as
evidence
of
their
attraction
for
him
hendricks
had
ever
known
to
pass
his
lips
hitherto
though
twenty
years
of
age
the
lad
had
never
spoken
of
women
as
though
he
was
aware
of
their
terrible
magic
he
had
not
discovered
them
as
females
necessary
to
every
healthy
male
it
was
not
purity
of
course
but
ignorance
he
had
felt
nothing
something
had
now
awakened
sex
in
him
so
that
he
knew
himself
a
man
and
naked
and
it
had
revolutionised
the
world
for
him
this
new
life
came
from
the
roots
transforming
listless
indifference
into
positive
desire
the
will
woke
out
of
sleep
and
all
the
currents
of
his
system
took
aggressive
form
for
all
energy
intellectual
emotional
or
spiritual
is
fundamentally
one
it
is
primarily
sexual
hendricks
paused
in
his
sentimental
walk
marvelling
that
he
had
not
realised
sooner
this
simple
truth
it
brought
a
certain
logical
meaning
even
into
the
pagan
rites
upon
the
mountains
these
ancient
rites
which
symbolised
the
marriage
of
the
two
tremendous
elements
of
wind
and
fire
heat
and
air
and
the
lad
s
quiet
busy
mood
that
morning
confirmed
his
simple
discovery
it
involved
restraint
and
purpose
lord
ernie
was
alive
hendricks
would
take
home
with
him
to
those
ancestral
halls
a
vessel
bursting
with
energy
creative
energy
it
was
admirable
that
he
should
witness
from
a
safe
distance
this
primitive
ceremony
of
crude
pagan
origin
it
was
the
very
thing
and
the
tutor
hurried
back
to
the
house
among
the
vineyards
aware
that
his
responsibility
had
increased
but
persuaded
more
than
ever
that
his
course
was
justified
the
sky
held
calm
and
cloudless
through
the
day
the
forests
brooding
beneath
the
hazy
autumn
sunshine
indications
that
the
second
hurricane
lay
brewing
among
the
heights
were
not
wanting
however
to
experienced
eyes
almost
a
preternatural
silence
reigned
there
was
a
warm
heaviness
in
the
placid
atmosphere
the
surface
of
the
lake
was
patched
and
streaky
the
extreme
clarity
of
the
air
an
ominous
omen
distant
objects
were
too
close
towards
sunset
moreover
the
streaks
and
patches
vanished
as
though
sucked
below
while
thin
strips
of
tenuous
cloud
appeared
from
nowhere
above
the
northern
cliffs
they
moved
with
great
rapidity
at
an
enormous
height
touched
with
a
lurid
brilliance
as
the
sun
sank
out
of
sight
and
when
hendricks
strolled
over
with
lord
ernie
to
for
supper
there
came
a
sudden
rush
of
heated
wind
that
set
the
branches
sharply
rattling
then
died
away
as
abruptly
as
it
rose
they
seemed
reflected
too
these
disturbances
in
the
human
atmospheres
about
the
supper
table
there
was
suppression
of
various
emotions
emotions
presaging
violence
lord
ernie
was
exhilarated
hendricks
uneasy
and
preoccupied
the
pasteur
grave
and
thoughtful
in
hendricks
was
another
feeling
as
well
that
he
had
lightly
summoned
a
storm
which
might
carry
him
off
his
feet
the
boy
s
excitement
increased
it
as
fan
a
starting
fire
his
own
judgment
had
somewhere
played
him
false
betraying
him
into
this
incredible
adventure
and
yet
he
could
not
stop
it
the
pasteur
s
influence
was
over
him
perhaps
he
was
ashamed
to
turn
back
he
was
committed
the
unusual
circumstances
found
the
weakness
in
his
character
for
somewhere
in
the
preposterous
superstition
there
lay
a
big
forgotten
truth
he
could
not
believe
it
and
yet
he
did
believe
it
the
world
had
forgotten
how
to
live
truly
close
to
nature
a
desultory
conversation
was
carried
on
chiefly
between
the
two
men
while
the
boy
ate
hungrily
and
mme
leysin
watched
her
husband
with
anxiety
as
she
served
the
simple
meal
so
you
are
coming
with
us
and
you
like
to
come
the
pasteur
observed
quietly
hendricks
translating
lord
ernie
replied
with
a
gesture
of
unmistakable
enthusiasm
a
wild
lot
of
men
and
women
leysin
went
on
keeping
his
eye
hard
upon
him
with
an
interesting
worship
of
their
own
copied
from
very
ancient
times
they
live
on
the
heights
and
mix
little
with
us
valley
folk
you
shall
see
their
ceremonies
they
get
the
wind
and
fire
into
themselves
don
t
they
asked
the
boy
keenly
and
somewhat
to
the
distress
of
the
translator
who
rendered
it
they
get
into
wind
and
they
worship
wind
and
fire
leysin
replied
and
they
do
it
by
means
of
a
wonderful
dance
that
somehow
imitates
the
leap
of
flame
and
the
headlong
rush
of
wind
if
you
copy
the
movements
and
gestures
of
a
person
you
discover
the
emotion
that
causes
them
you
share
it
their
idea
is
apparently
that
by
imitating
the
movements
they
invite
or
attract
the
force
draw
these
elemental
powers
into
their
systems
so
that
in
the
end
he
stopped
suddenly
catching
the
tutor
s
eye
lord
ernie
seemed
to
understand
without
translation
he
had
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
was
leaning
forward
across
the
table
listening
with
deep
absorption
his
expression
was
alert
with
a
new
intelligence
that
was
almost
cunning
an
acute
sensibility
seemed
to
have
awakened
in
him
as
with
laughing
i
suppose
he
said
in
an
undertone
to
hendricks
quickly
if
you
imitate
a
laugher
you
laugh
yourself
in
the
end
and
feel
all
the
jolly
excitement
of
laughter
is
that
what
he
means
the
tutor
nodded
with
assumed
indifference
imitation
is
always
infectious
he
said
lightly
but
of
course
you
will
not
imitate
these
wild
people
yourself
bindy
we
ll
just
look
on
from
a
from
a
distance
repeated
the
boy
obviously
disappointed
what
s
the
good
of
that
a
look
of
obstinacy
passed
across
his
altered
face
hendricks
met
his
eyes
squarely
at
a
circus
he
said
firmly
you
just
watch
you
don
t
imitate
the
clown
do
you
if
you
look
on
long
enough
you
do
was
the
rather
dogged
reply
well
take
the
russian
dancers
we
saw
in
moscow
the
other
insisted
patiently
you
felt
the
power
and
beauty
without
jumping
up
and
whirling
in
your
stall
bindy
half
glared
at
him
there
was
almost
contempt
in
his
quiet
answer
but
your
mind
whirled
with
them
and
later
your
body
would
too
otherwise
it
s
given
you
he
paused
a
second
i
can
only
get
the
fun
of
riding
by
being
on
a
horse
s
back
and
doing
his
movements
exactly
with
him
not
by
watching
hendricks
smiled
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
did
not
wish
to
discourage
the
enthusiasm
lying
behind
this
analysis
the
uneasiness
in
him
grew
apace
he
said
something
rapidly
in
french
using
an
undertone
and
laughter
to
confuse
the
actual
words
of
course
we
must
not
interfere
with
their
ceremonies
put
in
the
pasteur
with
decision
it
s
sacred
to
them
we
can
hide
among
the
trees
and
watch
you
would
not
leave
your
seat
in
church
to
imitate
the
priest
would
you
he
glanced
smilingly
at
the
eager
youth
before
him
if
he
did
something
real
i
it
was
said
with
a
bright
flash
in
the
eyes
anything
real
i
d
copy
like
a
shot
only
i
never
find
the
reply
was
disconcerting
rather
and
hendricks
as
he
hurriedly
translated
made
a
clatter
with
his
knife
and
fork
for
something
in
him
rose
to
meet
the
truth
behind
the
curious
words
from
that
moment
as
though
catching
a
little
of
the
boy
s
exhilaration
he
passed
under
a
kind
of
spell
perhaps
it
was
in
spite
of
the
exaggeration
oddly
stimulating
this
dull
little
meal
at
the
village
masked
an
accumulating
vehemence
eager
to
break
loose
he
heard
the
old
father
s
voice
well
done
hendricks
you
have
accomplished
wonders
he
would
take
back
the
boy
alive
yet
all
the
time
there
were
streaks
and
patches
on
his
soul
as
upon
the
surface
of
the
lake
that
afternoon
there
were
signs
of
terror
he
felt
himself
letting
go
an
increasing
recklessness
a
yielding
up
more
and
more
of
his
own
authority
to
that
of
this
triumphant
boy
bindy
understood
the
meaning
of
it
all
and
felt
secure
hendricks
faltered
hesitated
stood
on
the
defensive
yet
ever
less
and
less
already
he
accepted
the
other
s
guidance
already
lord
ernie
s
leadership
was
in
the
ascendant
conviction
invariably
holds
dominion
over
doubt
they
ate
little
it
was
near
the
end
of
the
meal
when
the
wind
falling
from
a
clear
and
starlit
sky
struck
its
first
violent
blow
dropping
with
the
force
of
an
explosion
that
shook
the
wooden
house
and
passing
with
a
roar
towards
the
distant
lake
the
oil
lamp
suspended
from
the
ceiling
trembled
the
pasteur
looked
apprehensively
at
the
shuttered
windows
and
lord
ernie
with
startling
abruptness
stood
up
his
eyes
were
shining
his
voice
was
brisk
alert
and
deep
the
wind
the
wind
he
cried
think
what
it
ll
be
up
there
we
shall
feel
it
on
our
bodies
his
enthusiasm
was
like
a
rush
of
air
across
the
table
and
the
fire
he
went
on
the
flames
will
lick
all
over
and
tear
about
the
sky
i
feel
wild
and
full
of
them
already
how
splendid
and
the
flame
of
the
little
lamp
leaped
higher
in
the
chimney
as
he
said
it
the
violence
of
the
de
is
extraordinary
explained
leysin
as
he
got
up
to
turn
down
the
wick
and
the
second
outburst
the
rest
of
his
sentence
was
drowned
by
the
noise
of
hendricks
voice
telling
the
boy
to
sit
down
and
finish
his
supper
and
at
the
same
moment
the
pasteur
s
wife
came
in
as
though
a
stroke
of
wind
drove
behind
her
down
the
passage
the
door
slammed
in
the
draught
there
was
a
momentary
confusion
in
the
room
above
which
her
voice
rose
shrill
and
frightened
the
fires
are
alight
jules
she
whispered
in
her
the
forest
is
burning
all
along
the
upper
her
face
was
pale
and
her
speech
came
stumbling
she
lowered
her
lips
to
her
husband
s
ear
they
ll
be
looking
out
for
recruits
is
it
necessary
is
it
right
for
you
to
go
she
glanced
uneasily
at
the
english
visitors
you
know
the
danger
he
stopped
her
with
a
gesture
those
who
look
on
at
life
accomplish
nothing
he
answered
impatiently
one
must
act
always
act
chances
are
sent
to
be
taken
not
stared
he
rose
pushing
past
her
into
the
passage
and
as
he
did
so
she
gave
him
one
swift
comprehensive
look
of
tenderness
and
admiration
then
hurried
after
him
to
find
his
hat
and
cloak
willingly
she
would
have
kept
him
at
home
that
night
yet
gladly
in
another
sense
she
saw
him
go
she
fumbled
in
her
movements
ready
to
laugh
or
cry
or
pray
hendricks
saw
her
pain
and
understood
it
was
singular
how
the
woman
s
attitude
intensified
his
own
misgivings
her
behaviour
the
mere
expression
of
her
face
alone
made
the
adventure
so
absolutely
real
three
minutes
later
they
were
in
the
village
street
hendricks
and
lord
ernie
the
latter
impatient
in
the
road
beyond
saw
her
tall
figure
stoop
to
embrace
him
i
shall
pray
all
night
i
shall
watch
from
my
window
for
your
return
god
who
speaks
from
the
whirlwind
and
whose
pathway
is
the
fire
will
go
with
you
remember
the
younger
men
it
is
ever
the
younger
men
that
they
seek
to
take
her
words
were
half
hysterical
the
kiss
was
given
and
taken
the
open
doorway
framed
her
outline
a
moment
then
the
buttress
of
the
church
blotted
her
out
and
they
were
off
vii
and
at
once
the
curious
confusion
of
strong
wind
was
upon
them
gusts
howled
about
the
corners
of
the
shuttered
houses
and
tore
noisily
across
the
open
yards
dust
whirled
with
the
rapidity
as
of
some
spectral
white
machinery
a
tile
came
clattering
down
about
their
feet
while
overhead
the
roofs
had
an
air
of
shifting
toppling
bending
the
entire
village
seemed
scooped
up
and
shaken
then
dropped
upon
the
earth
again
in
tottering
fashion
this
way
gasped
the
little
pasteur
blown
sideways
like
a
sail
follow
me
almost
at
first
they
hurried
down
the
deserted
street
past
lampless
windows
and
doors
and
soon
were
beyond
the
cabaret
in
that
open
stretch
between
the
village
and
the
forest
where
the
wind
had
unobstructed
way
far
above
them
ran
the
fiery
mountain
ridge
they
saw
the
glare
reflected
in
the
sky
as
the
tempest
first
swept
them
all
three
together
then
separated
them
in
the
same
moment
they
seemed
to
spin
or
whirl
it
s
far
worse
than
i
expected
shouted
their
guide
here
give
me
your
hand
then
found
once
disentangled
from
his
flapping
cloak
that
no
one
stood
beside
him
for
each
of
them
it
was
a
single
fight
to
reach
the
shelter
of
the
woods
where
the
actual
ascent
began
an
instant
the
pasteur
seemed
to
hesitate
he
glanced
back
at
the
lighted
window
of
across
the
fields
at
the
line
of
fire
in
the
sky
at
the
figure
disappearing
in
the
blackness
immediately
ahead
where
s
the
boy
he
shouted
don
t
let
him
get
too
far
in
front
keep
close
wait
till
i
come
they
staggered
back
against
each
other
look
how
easily
he
s
slipped
ahead
already
this
howling
wind
hendricks
shouted
as
they
advanced
side
by
side
pushing
their
shoulders
against
the
storm
the
rest
of
the
sentence
vanished
into
space
leysin
shoved
him
forward
pointing
to
where
some
twenty
yards
in
front
the
figure
of
lord
ernie
head
down
was
battling
eagerly
with
the
hurricane
already
he
stood
near
to
the
shelter
of
the
trees
waving
his
arms
with
energy
towards
the
summits
where
the
fire
blazed
he
was
calling
something
at
the
top
of
his
voice
urging
them
to
hurry
his
voice
rushed
down
upon
them
with
a
pelt
of
wind
don
t
let
him
get
away
from
us
bawled
leysin
holding
his
hands
to
his
mouth
keep
him
in
reach
he
may
see
but
must
not
take
part
a
blow
full
in
the
face
that
smote
him
like
the
flat
of
a
great
sword
clapped
the
sentence
short
that
s
part
he
won
t
obey
me
hendricks
heard
it
as
they
plunged
across
the
windswept
reach
panting
struggling
forcing
their
bodies
sideways
like
crabs
against
the
terrific
force
of
the
descending
they
reached
the
protection
of
the
forest
wall
without
further
attempt
at
speech
here
there
was
sudden
peace
and
silence
for
the
tall
dense
trees
received
the
tempest
s
impact
like
a
cushion
stopping
it
they
paused
a
moment
to
recover
breath
but
although
the
first
exhaustion
speedily
passed
that
original
confusion
of
strong
wind
remained
in
hendricks
mind
at
least
for
wind
violent
enough
to
be
battled
with
has
a
scattering
effect
on
thought
and
blows
the
very
blood
about
something
in
him
snapped
its
cables
and
blew
out
to
sea
his
breath
drew
in
an
impetuous
quality
from
the
tempest
each
time
he
filled
his
lungs
there
was
agitation
in
him
that
caused
an
odd
exaggeration
of
the
emotions
the
boy
as
they
came
up
leaped
down
from
a
boulder
he
had
climbed
he
opened
his
arms
making
of
his
cloak
a
kind
of
sail
that
filled
and
flapped
at
last
he
cried
impatient
almost
vexed
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
the
wind
blew
me
along
we
shall
be
late
the
tutor
caught
his
arm
with
vigour
you
keep
by
us
ernest
d
you
hear
now
no
rushing
ahead
like
that
leysin
s
the
guide
not
he
even
shook
him
but
as
he
did
so
he
was
aware
that
he
himself
resisted
something
that
he
did
not
really
want
to
resist
something
that
urged
him
forcibly
a
little
more
and
he
would
yield
to
it
with
pleasure
with
abandon
finally
with
recklessness
a
reaction
of
panic
fear
ran
over
him
it
was
the
wind
i
tell
you
cried
the
boy
flinging
himself
free
with
a
hint
of
insolence
in
his
voice
for
it
s
alive
i
mean
to
see
everything
the
wind
s
our
leader
and
the
fire
s
our
he
made
a
movement
to
start
on
again
you
ll
obey
me
thundered
hendricks
or
else
you
ll
go
home
d
you
understand
with
exasperation
yet
with
uneasy
delight
he
noted
the
words
bindy
made
use
of
it
was
in
him
that
he
might
almost
have
uttered
them
himself
he
stepped
already
into
an
entirely
new
world
exhilaration
caught
him
even
now
putting
the
brake
on
was
mere
pretence
he
seized
the
lad
by
both
shoulders
and
pushed
him
to
the
rear
then
placed
himself
next
so
that
leysin
moved
in
front
and
led
the
way
the
procession
started
diving
into
the
comparative
shelter
of
the
forest
don
t
let
him
pass
you
he
heard
in
rapid
french
guide
him
that
s
all
the
power
s
already
in
his
blood
keep
yourself
in
hand
as
well
and
follow
me
the
roar
of
the
storm
above
them
carried
the
words
clean
off
the
world
here
in
the
forest
they
moved
it
seemed
along
the
floor
of
an
ocean
whose
surface
raged
with
dreadful
violence
any
moment
one
or
other
of
them
might
be
caught
up
to
that
surface
and
whirled
off
to
destruction
for
the
procession
was
not
one
with
itself
the
darkness
the
difficulty
of
hearing
what
each
said
the
feeling
too
that
each
climbed
for
himself
made
everything
seem
at
sixes
and
sevens
and
the
tutor
this
secret
exultation
growing
in
his
heart
denied
the
anxiety
that
kept
it
pace
and
battled
with
his
turbulent
emotions
a
divided
personality
his
power
over
the
boy
he
realised
had
gravely
weakened
a
little
time
ago
they
had
seemed
somehow
equal
now
however
a
complete
reversal
of
their
relative
positions
had
taken
place
the
boy
was
sure
of
himself
while
leysin
led
at
a
steady
mountaineer
s
pace
on
his
wiry
short
bowed
legs
hendricks
a
yard
or
two
behind
him
stumbled
a
good
deal
in
the
darkness
lord
ernie
forever
on
his
heels
eager
to
push
past
but
bindy
never
stumbled
there
was
no
flagging
in
his
muscles
he
moved
so
lightly
and
with
so
sure
a
tread
that
he
almost
seemed
to
dance
and
often
he
stopped
aside
to
leap
a
boulder
or
to
run
along
a
fallen
trunk
path
there
was
none
occasional
gusts
of
wind
rushed
gustily
down
into
these
depths
of
forest
where
they
moved
and
now
from
time
to
time
as
they
rose
nearer
to
the
line
of
fire
on
the
ridge
an
increasing
glare
lit
up
the
knuckled
roots
or
glimmered
on
the
bramble
thickets
and
heavy
beds
of
moss
it
was
astonishing
how
the
little
pasteur
never
missed
his
way
periods
of
thick
silence
alternated
with
moments
when
the
storm
swept
down
through
gullies
among
the
trees
reverberating
like
thunder
in
the
hollows
slowly
they
advanced
buffeted
driven
pushed
the
wildness
of
some
walpurgis
night
growing
upon
all
three
in
the
tutor
s
mind
was
this
strange
lift
of
increasing
recklessness
the
old
proportion
gone
the
spiritual
aspect
of
it
troubling
him
to
the
point
of
sheer
distress
he
followed
leysin
as
blindly
with
his
body
as
he
followed
this
new
bindy
eagerly
with
his
mind
for
this
languid
boy
now
dancing
to
the
tune
of
flooding
life
at
his
very
heels
seemed
magical
in
the
true
sense
energy
created
as
by
a
wizard
out
of
nothing
from
lips
that
ordinarily
sighed
in
listless
boredom
poured
now
a
ceaseless
stream
of
questions
and
ejaculations
ringing
with
enthusiasm
how
long
would
it
take
to
reach
the
fiery
ridge
why
did
they
go
so
slowly
would
they
arrive
too
late
would
their
intrusion
be
welcomed
or
understood
already
one
great
change
was
effected
accepted
by
hendricks
too
that
the
rôle
of
mere
spectator
was
impossible
the
answers
hendricks
gave
indeed
grew
more
and
more
encouraging
and
sympathetic
he
too
was
impatient
with
their
leader
s
crawling
pace
some
elemental
spell
of
wind
and
fire
urged
him
towards
the
open
ridge
the
pull
became
irresistible
he
despised
the
pasteur
s
caution
denied
his
wisdom
wholly
rejected
now
the
spirit
of
compromise
and
prudence
and
once
as
the
hurricane
brought
down
a
flying
burst
of
voices
he
caught
himself
leaping
upon
a
big
grey
boulder
in
their
path
he
leaped
at
the
very
moment
that
the
boy
behind
him
leaped
yet
hardly
realised
that
he
did
so
his
feet
danced
without
a
conscious
order
from
his
brain
they
met
together
on
the
rounded
top
stumbled
clutched
one
another
frantically
then
slid
with
waving
arms
and
flying
cloaks
down
the
slippery
surface
of
damp
moss
laughing
wildly
fool
cried
hendricks
saving
himself
what
in
the
world
called
laughed
bindy
picking
himself
up
and
dropping
back
to
his
place
in
the
rear
again
it
s
the
wind
not
me
it
s
in
our
feet
half
the
time
you
re
shouting
and
jumping
yourself
and
it
was
a
few
minutes
after
this
that
lord
ernie
suddenly
forged
ahead
he
slipped
in
front
as
silently
as
a
shadow
before
a
moving
candle
in
a
room
passing
the
tutor
at
a
moment
when
his
feet
were
entangled
among
roots
and
stones
he
easily
overtook
the
pasteur
and
found
himself
in
the
lead
he
never
stumbled
there
seemed
steel
springs
in
his
legs
from
leysin
too
breathless
to
interfere
came
a
cry
of
warning
stop
him
take
his
hand
his
tired
voice
instantly
smothered
by
the
roaring
skies
he
turned
to
catch
hendricks
by
the
cloak
you
see
he
shouted
in
alarm
for
the
love
of
god
don
t
lose
sight
of
him
he
must
see
but
not
take
part
remember
and
hendricks
yelled
after
the
vanishing
figure
bindy
go
slow
go
slow
keep
in
touch
with
but
he
quickened
his
pace
instantly
as
though
to
overtake
the
boy
he
passed
his
companion
the
same
minute
and
was
out
of
sight
i
ll
wait
for
you
came
back
the
boy
s
shrill
answer
through
the
thinning
trees
and
a
flare
of
light
fell
with
it
from
the
sky
for
the
final
climb
of
a
steep
five
hundred
feet
had
now
begun
and
overhead
the
naked
ridge
ran
east
and
west
with
its
line
of
blazing
fires
boulders
and
rocky
ground
replaced
the
pines
and
spruces
but
you
ll
never
find
the
way
shouted
leysin
while
a
deep
trumpeting
roar
of
the
storm
beyond
muffled
the
remainder
of
the
sentence
hendricks
heard
the
next
words
close
beside
him
from
a
clump
of
shadows
he
was
in
touching
distance
of
the
excited
boy
the
fires
and
the
singing
guide
me
only
a
fool
could
miss
the
but
you
a
he
swallowed
the
unuttered
word
a
new
extraordinary
respect
was
suddenly
in
him
that
tall
virile
figure
instinct
with
life
springing
so
cleverly
through
the
choking
darkness
guiding
with
decision
and
intelligence
almost
infallible
it
was
no
fool
that
led
them
thus
he
hurried
after
till
his
very
sinews
ached
his
eyes
troubled
and
confused
strained
through
the
trees
to
find
him
but
these
same
trees
now
fled
past
him
in
a
torrent
bindy
bindy
he
cried
at
the
top
of
his
voice
yet
not
with
the
imperious
tone
the
situation
called
for
the
sentence
dropped
into
a
lull
of
wind
instead
of
command
there
was
entreaty
almost
supplication
in
it
wait
for
me
i
m
coming
we
ll
see
the
glorious
thing
together
and
then
suddenly
the
forest
lay
behind
him
with
a
belt
of
open
in
front
below
the
actual
ridge
he
felt
the
first
great
draught
of
heat
as
a
line
of
furnaces
burst
their
doors
with
a
mighty
roar
and
turned
the
sky
into
a
blaze
of
golden
daylight
there
was
a
crackling
as
of
musketry
the
flare
shot
up
and
burned
the
air
about
him
and
the
voices
of
a
multitude
as
yet
invisible
drove
through
it
like
projectiles
on
the
wind
this
was
the
first
impression
wholesale
and
terrific
that
met
him
as
he
paused
an
instant
on
the
edge
of
the
sheltering
forest
and
looked
forward
leysin
and
lord
ernie
seemed
to
leave
his
mind
forgotten
in
this
first
attack
of
splendour
but
forgotten
as
it
were
the
first
with
contempt
the
latter
with
an
overwhelming
regret
for
the
pasteur
s
mistake
in
that
instant
seemed
obvious
in
half
measures
lay
the
fatal
error
and
in
compromise
the
danger
bindy
all
along
had
known
the
better
way
and
followed
it
the
lukewarm
was
the
worthless
bindy
boy
where
are
you
i
m
coming
and
stepping
on
to
the
grassy
strip
of
ground
soft
to
his
feet
he
met
a
wind
that
fell
upon
his
body
with
a
shower
of
blows
from
all
directions
at
once
and
beat
him
to
his
knees
he
dropped
it
seemed
into
the
cover
of
a
sheltering
rock
for
there
followed
then
a
moment
of
sudden
and
delicious
stillness
in
which
the
weary
muscles
recovered
themselves
and
thought
grew
slightly
steadier
crouched
thus
close
to
the
earth
he
no
longer
offered
a
target
to
the
hurricane
s
attack
he
peered
upwards
making
a
screen
of
his
hands
the
ridge
some
fifty
feet
above
him
he
saw
ran
in
a
generous
platform
along
the
mountain
crest
it
was
wide
and
flat
between
the
enormous
fires
of
wood
that
stretched
for
half
a
mile
coiled
a
medley
of
dense
smoke
and
tearing
sparks
no
human
beings
were
visible
and
yet
he
was
aware
of
crowding
life
quite
near
on
hands
and
knees
crawling
painfully
he
then
slowly
retreated
again
into
the
shelter
of
the
forest
he
had
sought
to
leave
he
stood
up
the
awful
blaze
was
veiled
by
the
roof
of
branches
once
more
but
as
he
rose
seizing
a
sapling
to
steady
himself
by
two
hands
caught
him
with
violence
from
behind
and
a
familiar
voice
came
shouting
against
his
ear
leysin
panting
dishevelled
and
half
broken
with
the
speed
stood
beside
him
the
boy
where
is
he
we
re
just
in
time
he
roared
the
words
to
make
them
carry
above
the
din
hurry
hurry
i
ll
follow
my
older
legs
see
for
the
love
of
god
that
he
is
not
taken
i
warned
you
and
for
a
second
as
he
heard
hendricks
caught
at
the
vanished
sense
of
responsibility
again
he
saw
the
face
of
the
old
marquess
watching
him
among
the
tree
trunks
he
heard
his
voice
amazed
reproachful
furious
it
was
criminal
of
you
criminal
where
is
the
boy
boy
again
broke
in
the
shout
of
the
pasteur
with
a
slap
of
hurricane
as
he
staggered
against
the
tutor
half
collapsing
and
trying
to
point
the
direction
watch
him
find
him
for
the
love
of
heaven
before
it
is
too
late
before
they
see
him
the
tutor
s
normal
and
responsible
self
dived
out
of
sight
again
as
he
heard
the
cry
of
weakness
and
alarm
it
seemed
the
wind
got
under
him
lifting
him
bodily
from
his
feet
he
did
not
pause
to
think
like
a
man
midway
in
a
whirling
he
felt
dazed
but
confident
only
conscious
of
one
thing
that
he
must
hold
out
to
the
end
take
part
in
all
the
splendid
fighting
the
lust
of
the
arena
the
pride
of
youth
and
battle
the
impetuous
recklessness
of
the
charge
in
primitive
war
caught
at
his
heart
brimming
it
with
headlong
courage
to
play
the
game
for
all
it
might
be
worth
seemed
shouted
everywhere
about
him
as
the
abandon
of
wind
and
fire
rushed
through
him
like
a
storm
he
felt
lifted
above
all
possibility
of
little
failure
the
marquess
with
his
conventional
traditions
the
pasteur
with
his
considerations
of
safety
both
vanished
utterly
safety
indeed
both
for
himself
and
for
the
boy
in
his
charge
lay
in
unconditional
surrender
this
was
no
time
for
little
actions
it
was
all
or
nothing
god
bless
the
whirlwind
and
the
fire
he
shouted
opening
wide
his
arms
but
his
voice
was
inaudible
amid
the
uproar
and
the
forward
movement
of
his
body
remained
at
first
only
in
the
brain
he
turned
to
push
the
old
man
aside
even
to
strike
him
down
if
necessary
lukewarm
yourself
and
a
coward
rose
in
his
throat
yet
found
no
utterance
for
in
that
moment
a
tall
slim
figure
swift
as
a
shadow
steady
as
a
hawk
shot
hard
across
the
open
space
between
the
forest
and
the
ridge
in
the
direction
of
the
blazing
platform
it
disappeared
against
a
curtain
of
thick
smoke
emerged
for
one
second
in
a
storm
of
light
then
vanished
finally
behind
a
ruin
of
loose
rocks
and
hendricks
his
eyes
wounded
by
heat
and
wind
his
muscles
paralysed
understood
that
the
boy
deliberately
invited
capture
the
multitude
that
hid
behind
the
smoke
and
fire
feeding
the
blazing
heaps
with
eager
hands
had
become
aware
of
him
and
presently
would
appear
to
claim
him
they
would
take
him
to
themselves
already
answering
flares
ran
east
and
west
along
the
desolate
ridge
i
ll
join
you
i
m
coming
wait
for
me
he
tried
to
cry
the
uproar
smothered
it
viii
and
this
uproar
he
now
perceived
was
composed
entirely
of
wind
and
fire
here
on
the
roof
of
the
hills
beneath
a
starry
sky
these
two
great
elements
expressed
their
nature
with
unhampered
freedom
for
there
was
neither
rain
to
modify
the
one
nor
solid
obstacle
to
check
the
other
their
voices
merged
in
a
single
sound
the
hollow
boom
of
wind
and
the
deep
resounding
clap
of
flame
the
splitting
crackle
of
burning
branches
imitated
the
high
shrill
whistle
of
the
tearing
gusts
that
flew
to
and
fro
in
darts
of
swifter
sound
but
one
shout
rose
from
the
summit
no
human
cry
distinguishable
in
it
nor
amid
the
thousand
lines
of
skeleton
wood
that
pierced
the
golden
background
was
any
human
outline
visible
fire
and
wind
encouraged
one
another
to
madness
manifesting
in
prodigious
splendour
by
themselves
then
suddenly
before
a
gigantic
canter
of
the
wind
the
driving
smoke
rolled
upwards
like
a
curtain
and
the
flames
ceasing
their
wild
flapping
soared
steadily
in
gothic
windows
of
living
gold
towards
the
stars
in
towering
rows
between
columns
of
black
night
they
transformed
the
empty
space
between
them
into
a
colossal
temple
aisle
they
tapered
aloft
symmetrically
into
vanishing
crests
and
hendricks
stood
upright
rising
so
that
his
shoulders
topped
the
edge
of
the
boulder
and
utterly
contemptuous
of
leysin
s
hand
that
sought
with
violence
to
drag
him
into
shelter
he
gazed
as
one
who
sees
a
vision
for
at
first
he
could
only
stand
and
stare
aware
of
sensation
but
not
of
thought
an
enormous
overpowering
conviction
blew
his
whole
being
to
white
heat
here
was
a
supply
of
elemental
power
that
human
beings
empty
needy
starved
deficient
human
beings
could
use
his
love
for
the
boy
leaped
headlong
at
the
skirts
of
this
terrific
salvation
a
majestic
possibility
stormed
through
him
yet
it
was
no
nightmare
wonder
that
met
his
staring
and
eyes
although
some
touch
of
awful
dream
seemed
in
it
set
moreover
to
a
scale
that
scantier
minds
might
deem
distortion
the
heat
from
some
thirty
fires
placed
at
regular
intervals
made
midnight
quiver
with
immense
vibrations
of
varying
yet
calculated
size
these
towering
heaps
emitted
notes
of
measured
and
alternating
depth
until
the
roar
along
the
entire
line
produced
a
definite
scale
almost
of
melody
the
near
ones
shrilly
singing
those
more
distant
booming
with
mountainous
pedal
notes
the
consonance
was
monstrous
yet
conformed
to
some
magnificent
diapason
this
chord
of
paced
the
starlit
sky
directed
but
never
overmastered
by
the
wind
that
measured
it
somehow
into
meaning
repeated
in
quick
succession
the
notes
now
crashing
in
a
mass
now
singing
alone
in
solitary
beauty
the
effect
suggested
an
idea
of
ordered
sequence
of
gigantic
rhythm
it
seemed
indeed
as
though
some
controlling
agency
mastering
excess
coerced
both
raging
elements
to
express
through
this
stupendous
dance
some
definite
idea
here
as
it
were
was
the
alphabet
of
some
natural
undifferentiated
language
a
language
of
sight
and
sound
predating
speech
symbolical
in
the
ultimate
deific
sense
some
lord
of
fire
and
some
lord
of
air
were
in
command
harnessed
and
regulated
these
formless
cohorts
of
energy
that
men
call
stupidly
mere
flame
and
wind
obeyed
a
higher
power
that
had
invoked
them
yet
a
power
that
by
understanding
their
laws
of
being
held
them
most
admirably
in
control
this
at
least
seems
a
hint
of
the
explanation
that
flashed
into
hendricks
as
he
stared
in
amazed
bewilderment
from
the
shelter
of
the
nearest
boulder
he
read
a
sentence
in
some
natural
forgotten
script
he
watched
a
primitive
ritual
that
once
invoked
the
gods
he
was
aware
of
rhythm
and
he
was
aware
of
system
though
as
yet
he
did
not
see
the
hand
that
wrote
this
marvellous
sentence
on
the
night
for
still
the
human
element
remained
invisible
he
only
realised
in
dim
blundering
fashion
that
he
witnessed
a
revelation
of
those
two
powers
which
in
large
lie
at
the
foundations
of
the
universe
and
in
little
are
the
basic
essentials
of
human
existence
the
powers
behind
heat
and
air
fragments
of
that
talk
with
leysin
stammered
back
across
his
mind
like
letters
in
some
stupendous
word
he
dared
not
reconstruct
entire
he
shuddered
and
grew
wise
realms
of
forgotten
being
opened
their
doors
before
his
dazzled
sight
vision
fluttered
into
far
piercing
vistas
of
ancient
wonder
haunting
and
then
lost
its
way
in
blindness
that
was
pain
for
a
moment
it
seemed
he
was
aware
of
majestic
presences
behind
the
turmoil
shadowy
but
mighty
charged
with
a
vague
potentiality
as
of
immense
algebraical
formulae
symbolical
and
beyond
full
comprehension
yet
willing
and
able
to
be
used
for
practical
results
he
the
elements
as
nerves
of
a
living
universe
yet
thinking
was
not
really
in
him
anywhere
feeling
was
all
he
knew
the
world
he
moved
in
as
the
script
he
read
belonged
to
conditions
too
utterly
remote
for
reason
to
recover
a
single
clue
to
their
intelligible
reconstruction
glory
clean
and
strong
as
of
primitive
passed
between
what
he
saw
and
all
that
he
had
ever
known
before
the
curtain
of
conventional
belief
was
rent
in
twain
the
terrific
thing
was
true
for
an
unmeasured
interval
the
tutor
oblivious
of
time
and
actual
place
stood
on
the
brink
of
this
majestic
pageant
staring
with
breathless
awe
while
the
swaying
of
the
entire
scenery
increased
like
the
sway
of
an
ocean
lifted
to
the
sky
by
many
winds
then
suddenly
in
one
of
those
temporary
lulls
that
passed
between
the
beat
of
the
great
notes
his
searching
eyes
discovered
a
new
thing
the
focus
of
his
sight
was
altered
and
he
realised
at
last
the
source
of
the
directing
and
the
controlling
power
behind
the
fires
and
beyond
the
smoke
he
recognised
the
shining
ovals
that
upon
this
little
earth
stand
in
the
image
of
the
one
eternal
likeness
he
saw
the
human
faces
symbols
of
spiritual
dominion
over
all
lesser
orders
each
one
possessed
of
belief
intelligence
and
will
singly
so
feeble
together
so
invincible
this
assemblage
unscorched
by
the
fire
and
by
the
wind
unmoved
seemed
to
him
impressive
beyond
all
possible
words
and
a
further
inkling
of
the
truth
flashed
on
him
as
he
stared
that
a
group
of
humans
a
crowd
combining
upon
a
given
object
with
concentrated
purpose
possessed
of
that
terrific
power
certain
faith
may
know
in
themselves
the
energy
to
move
great
mountains
and
therefore
that
lesser
energy
to
guide
the
fluid
forces
of
the
elements
and
a
sense
of
cosmic
exultation
leaped
into
his
being
for
a
moment
he
knew
a
touch
of
almost
frenzy
proud
joy
rose
in
him
like
a
splendour
of
omnipotence
humanity
it
seemed
to
him
here
came
into
a
grand
but
long
neglected
corner
of
its
kingdom
as
originally
planned
by
heaven
into
the
hands
of
a
weakling
and
deficient
boy
the
guidance
had
been
given
motionless
beneath
the
stars
lit
by
the
glare
till
they
shone
like
idols
of
yellow
stone
and
magnified
by
the
sheets
of
flying
intolerable
light
the
wind
chased
to
and
fro
these
rows
of
faces
appeared
at
first
as
a
single
line
of
undifferentiated
fire
against
the
background
of
the
night
the
eyes
were
all
cast
down
in
prayer
each
mind
focused
steadily
upon
one
clear
idea
the
control
and
assimilation
of
two
elemental
powers
the
crowd
was
one
feeling
was
one
desire
command
and
certain
faith
were
one
the
controlling
power
that
resulted
was
irresistible
then
came
a
remarkable
concerted
movement
with
one
accord
the
eyes
all
opened
blazing
with
reflected
fire
a
hundred
human
countenances
rose
in
a
single
shining
line
the
men
stood
upright
swarthy
faces
tanned
by
sun
and
wind
heads
uncovered
hair
and
beards
tossing
in
the
air
turned
all
one
way
mouths
opened
too
there
came
a
roar
that
even
the
hurricane
could
not
drown
a
word
of
command
it
seemed
that
sprang
into
the
pulses
of
the
dancing
elements
and
reduced
their
turmoil
to
a
wave
of
steadier
movement
and
at
the
same
moment
a
hundred
bodies
naked
above
the
waist
arms
outstretched
and
hands
with
the
palms
held
upwards
swayed
forwards
through
the
smoke
and
fire
they
came
towards
the
spot
where
half
concealed
from
view
the
tutor
crouched
and
watched
and
hendricks
thinking
himself
discovered
first
quailed
then
rose
to
meet
them
no
power
to
resist
was
in
him
it
was
rather
willing
response
that
he
experienced
he
stepped
out
from
the
shelter
of
the
boulder
and
entered
the
brilliant
glare
hatless
himself
shoulders
squared
cloak
flying
in
the
wind
he
took
three
strides
towards
the
advancing
battalion
then
undecided
paused
for
the
line
he
saw
disregarded
him
as
though
he
were
not
there
at
all
it
was
not
the
worshippers
sought
the
entire
troop
swept
past
to
a
point
some
fifty
feet
below
where
the
end
of
the
ridge
broke
out
of
the
thinning
trees
beautiful
as
a
curving
wave
of
flame
the
figures
streamed
across
the
narrow
open
space
with
a
drilled
precision
as
of
some
battle
line
and
hendricks
with
a
sense
of
wild
secret
triumph
saw
them
pause
at
the
brink
of
the
platformed
ridge
form
up
their
serried
ranks
yet
closer
then
open
two
hundred
arms
to
welcome
some
one
whom
the
darkness
should
immediately
deliver
simultaneously
from
the
covering
trees
the
tall
slim
shadow
of
lord
ernie
darted
out
into
the
light
magnificent
cried
hendricks
but
his
voice
was
smothered
instantly
in
a
mightier
sound
and
his
movement
forward
seemed
ineffective
stumbling
the
hundred
voices
thundered
out
a
single
note
like
a
deer
the
boy
leaped
like
a
tongue
of
flame
he
flew
to
join
his
own
and
instantly
was
surrounded
borne
upon
those
upturned
palms
swept
back
in
triumph
towards
the
procession
of
enormous
fires
wrapped
by
smoke
and
sparks
lifted
by
wind
he
became
part
of
the
monstrous
rhythm
that
turned
that
mountain
ridge
alive
he
stood
upright
upon
the
platform
of
interlacing
arms
he
swayed
with
their
movements
as
a
thing
of
wind
and
fire
that
flew
the
shining
faces
vanished
then
turned
all
towards
the
blazing
piles
so
that
the
boy
had
the
appearance
of
standing
on
a
wall
of
living
black
his
outline
was
visible
a
moment
against
the
sky
firelight
between
his
legs
streaming
from
his
hair
and
horizontal
arms
issuing
almost
as
it
seemed
from
his
very
body
the
next
second
he
leaped
to
the
ground
ran
forward
appallingly
close
between
two
fires
flung
both
hands
heavenwards
and
knelt
and
hendricks
sympathetically
following
the
boy
s
performance
as
though
his
own
mind
and
body
took
part
in
it
experienced
then
a
singular
result
it
seemed
the
heart
in
him
began
to
roar
this
was
no
rustle
of
excited
blood
that
the
little
cavern
of
his
skull
increased
but
a
deeper
sound
that
proclaimed
the
kinship
of
his
entire
being
with
the
ritual
his
own
nature
had
begun
to
answer
from
that
moment
he
perceived
the
spectacle
not
with
the
senses
of
sight
and
hearing
separately
but
with
his
entire
body
synthetically
he
became
a
part
of
this
assembly
that
was
itself
one
single
instrument
a
cosmic
for
the
rhythmical
expression
of
impersonal
nature
powers
leysin
he
dimly
realised
fixed
in
his
churchy
tenets
remained
outside
apart
and
compromising
hendricks
accepted
and
went
with
all
little
customary
feelings
dipped
utterly
away
lost
false
denied
even
as
a
unit
in
a
crowd
loses
its
normal
characteristics
in
the
greater
mood
that
sways
the
whole
the
fire
no
longer
burned
him
for
he
was
the
fire
nor
did
he
stagger
against
the
furious
wind
because
the
wind
was
in
his
heart
he
moved
all
over
alive
in
every
point
and
corner
with
his
skin
he
breathed
his
bones
and
tissue
ran
with
glorious
heat
he
cried
aloud
he
praised
i
am
the
whirlwind
and
i
am
the
fire
fire
that
lights
but
does
not
burn
and
wind
that
blows
the
heart
to
flame
his
body
sang
it
or
rather
the
elements
sang
it
through
his
body
for
the
sound
of
his
voice
was
not
audible
and
it
was
wind
and
fire
that
thundered
forth
his
feeling
in
their
crashing
rhythm
ix
and
so
it
was
that
he
no
longer
saw
this
thing
pictorially
nor
in
the
little
detached
reports
the
individual
senses
brought
but
knew
it
in
himself
complete
as
a
man
knows
love
and
passion
memory
afterwards
translated
these
vast
central
feelings
into
pictures
but
the
pictures
touched
reality
without
containing
it
like
a
vision
it
happened
all
at
once
as
a
room
or
landscape
happens
and
what
happens
all
at
once
coming
through
a
synthesis
of
the
senses
is
not
properly
describable
later
to
instantaneous
knowledge
mere
sequence
is
a
falsehood
the
sequence
first
comes
in
with
the
telling
afterwards
that
kneeling
form
he
understood
was
the
empty
vessel
to
which
conventional
life
had
hitherto
denied
the
heat
and
air
it
craved
the
breath
of
life
now
poured
at
full
tide
into
it
the
fire
of
deity
lit
its
heart
of
touchwood
wind
blew
into
desire
and
later
flame
would
burst
forth
in
action
consuming
opposition
he
must
let
it
fill
to
the
brim
it
was
not
salvation
but
creation
then
thought
went
out
extinguished
by
a
puff
of
something
greater
for
beyond
the
smoke
and
sparks
beyond
the
space
the
men
had
occupied
a
new
and
gentler
movement
lyrical
with
beauty
ran
suddenly
along
the
ridge
what
hendricks
had
taken
for
branches
heaped
in
rows
for
the
burning
stirred
marvellously
throughout
their
whole
collective
mass
stirred
sweetly
too
and
with
an
exquisite
loveliness
the
entire
line
rose
gracefully
into
the
air
with
a
whirr
as
of
sweeping
birds
there
was
a
soft
and
undulating
motion
as
though
a
draught
of
flowing
wind
turned
faintly
visible
yet
with
an
increasing
brilliance
like
shining
lilies
of
flame
that
now
flocked
forward
in
a
troop
bending
deliciously
all
one
way
and
in
the
same
second
these
tall
lilies
of
fire
revealed
themselves
as
figures
naked
above
the
waist
hair
streaming
on
the
wind
eyes
alight
and
bare
arms
waving
above
the
men
s
deep
pedal
bass
their
voices
rose
with
clear
shrill
sweetness
on
the
storm
the
band
swept
forwards
swift
as
wind
towards
the
kneeling
boy
the
long
line
curved
about
him
foldingly
the
women
took
him
as
the
south
wind
takes
a
bird
there
may
have
been
indeed
there
was
an
interval
for
hendricks
caught
again
and
again
repeated
the
boy
s
great
cry
of
passionate
delight
above
the
tumult
ringing
and
virile
it
rose
to
heaven
clear
as
a
bell
and
instantaneously
the
knitted
figures
of
flame
disentangled
themselves
again
the
mass
unfolded
like
an
opening
flower
and
as
by
a
military
word
of
command
dissolved
itself
once
more
into
a
long
thin
line
of
running
fire
the
women
advanced
and
the
waiting
men
flowed
forward
in
a
stream
to
meet
them
this
interweaving
of
the
figures
was
as
easily
accomplished
as
the
mingling
of
light
and
heavy
threads
upon
some
living
loom
hands
joining
hands
all
singing
these
naked
worshippers
of
fire
and
wind
passed
in
and
out
among
the
blazing
piles
with
a
headlong
precision
that
was
torrential
and
yet
orderly
the
speed
increased
the
faces
flashed
and
vanished
then
flashed
and
passed
again
each
woman
between
two
men
each
man
between
two
women
and
lord
ernie
radiantly
alive
between
two
girls
of
rich
o
erflowing
beauty
their
movements
were
undulating
like
the
undulations
of
fire
yet
with
sudden
unexpected
upward
leaps
as
when
fire
is
partnered
abruptly
by
a
cantering
wind
for
the
women
were
fire
and
the
men
were
wind
the
imitative
dance
was
in
full
swing
the
marvellous
wind
and
fire
ritual
unrolled
its
magic
it
was
certainly
but
for
hendricks
as
he
watched
the
terror
of
big
conflagrations
was
wholly
absent
rather
he
felt
the
sense
of
deep
security
that
rhythmic
movement
causes
bathed
in
a
sea
of
elemental
power
he
burned
to
share
the
pagan
splendour
and
the
rush
of
primitive
delight
it
seemed
he
had
a
cosmic
body
in
which
new
centres
stirred
to
life
linking
him
on
to
this
source
of
natural
forces
through
these
centres
he
drew
the
chaotic
energy
into
nerves
and
blood
and
muscle
into
the
very
substance
of
his
thought
indeed
transmuting
them
into
the
magic
of
the
will
abundant
and
inexhaustible
vigour
filled
the
air
pouring
freely
into
whatever
empty
receptacle
lay
at
hand
sheets
of
flame
whole
separate
fragments
of
it
torn
at
the
edges
raced
loudly
hungrily
flapping
on
vehement
gusts
of
wind
curved
as
they
flew
leaped
twisted
flashed
and
vanished
and
the
figures
closely
copied
them
the
women
tossed
their
bodies
aloft
then
dipped
suddenly
to
the
earth
invisible
till
the
rushing
men
urged
them
into
view
again
with
wild
impetuous
swing
so
that
the
entire
line
stretched
and
contracted
like
an
immense
elastic
band
of
life
now
knotted
now
dissolved
yet
while
of
raging
and
terrific
beauty
there
was
never
that
mad
abandon
which
is
disorder
but
rather
a
kind
of
sacred
natural
revel
that
prohibited
mere
licence
there
was
even
a
singular
austerity
in
it
that
betrayed
a
definite
ritual
and
not
mere
reckless
pageantry
no
walls
could
possibly
have
contained
it
in
cathedral
temple
or
measured
space
however
grand
it
could
only
have
seemed
exaggerated
and
apostate
here
beneath
the
open
sky
it
was
beautiful
and
true
for
overhead
the
stars
burned
clear
and
steady
the
constellations
watching
it
from
their
immovable
towers
a
representation
of
their
own
leisured
and
hierarchic
dance
in
swifter
miniature
and
indeed
this
relationship
it
bore
to
a
universal
rhythm
was
the
key
it
seemed
to
its
deep
significance
for
the
close
imitation
of
natural
movements
seduced
the
colossal
powers
of
fire
and
wind
to
swell
human
emotions
till
they
became
mould
and
vessel
for
this
elemental
manifestation
in
men
and
women
golden
yellow
in
the
blaze
the
limbs
of
the
women
flashed
and
passed
their
hair
flew
dark
a
moment
across
gleaming
breasts
and
their
waving
arms
tossed
in
patterns
through
the
driving
smoke
the
fires
boiled
and
roared
scattering
torrents
of
showering
sparks
like
stars
and
amid
it
all
the
slim
white
shoulders
of
the
boy
his
clothes
torn
from
him
his
eyes
ablaze
and
his
lips
opened
to
the
singing
as
though
he
had
known
it
always
drove
to
and
fro
on
the
crest
of
the
ritual
like
some
flying
figure
of
wind
and
fire
incarnate
all
of
which
instantaneously
yet
in
sequence
hendricks
witnessed
painted
upon
the
wild
night
sky
a
volcanic
energy
poured
through
him
too
he
knew
a
golden
enthusiasm
of
immeasurable
strength
of
unconquerable
hope
of
irresistible
delight
wind
set
his
feet
to
dancing
and
fire
swept
across
his
face
without
a
trace
of
burning
nature
was
part
of
him
he
had
stepped
inside
no
obstacle
existed
that
could
withstand
for
a
single
second
the
torrential
energy
that
fired
his
heart
and
blood
there
was
lightning
in
his
veins
he
could
sweep
aside
life
s
difficult
barriers
with
the
ease
of
a
tornado
and
shake
the
rubbish
of
doubt
and
care
from
the
years
with
earthquake
shocks
empires
he
could
mould
and
play
with
nations
drive
men
and
women
before
him
like
a
flock
of
sheep
shatter
convention
and
dislocate
the
machinery
time
has
foisted
upon
natural
energies
he
knew
in
himself
the
omnipotence
of
the
lesser
elemental
deities
yet
as
sympathetic
observer
he
can
but
have
felt
a
tithe
of
what
lord
ernie
felt
we
are
the
whirlwind
and
we
are
the
fire
he
cried
aloud
with
the
rushing
worshippers
we
are
unconquerable
and
immense
we
destroy
the
lukewarm
and
absorb
the
weak
for
we
can
make
evil
into
good
by
bending
it
all
one
way
the
roar
swept
thunderingly
past
him
catching
at
his
voice
and
body
he
felt
himself
snatched
forward
by
the
wind
the
fire
licked
sweetly
at
him
it
was
the
final
abandonment
he
plunged
recklessly
towards
the
surge
of
dancers
x
what
stopped
him
he
did
not
know
some
hard
and
steely
thing
pricked
sharply
into
him
an
opposing
power
fierce
as
a
sword
stabbed
at
his
heart
and
he
heard
a
little
sound
quite
close
beside
him
a
sound
that
pierced
the
babel
reaching
his
consciousness
as
from
far
away
keep
still
cling
tight
to
this
old
rock
hold
yourself
in
or
else
they
ll
have
you
too
it
was
as
if
some
insect
scratched
within
his
ear
his
arm
that
same
instant
was
violently
seized
he
came
down
with
a
crash
he
had
been
half
in
the
air
he
had
been
dancing
turn
your
eyes
away
away
take
hold
of
this
big
tree
the
voice
cried
furiously
but
with
a
petty
human
passion
in
it
that
marred
the
world
there
was
an
intolerable
revulsion
in
him
as
he
heard
it
he
felt
himself
dragged
forcibly
backwards
he
lost
his
balance
stumbling
among
loose
stones
loose
me
let
me
go
he
shouted
struggling
like
a
wild
animal
yet
vainly
against
the
inflexible
grip
that
held
him
i
am
one
with
the
fire
that
lights
but
does
not
burn
i
am
the
wind
that
blows
the
worlds
along
damnation
take
you
let
me
free
confusion
caught
him
smothering
speech
and
blinding
sight
he
fell
backwards
away
from
the
heat
and
wind
he
was
furious
but
furious
with
he
knew
not
whom
or
what
the
interference
had
destroyed
the
rhythm
broken
it
into
fragments
violent
impulses
clashed
through
him
without
the
will
to
choose
or
guide
them
for
power
had
deserted
him
and
flowed
elsewhere
he
stood
no
longer
in
the
stream
of
energy
he
was
emptied
and
at
first
he
could
not
tell
whether
his
instinct
was
to
return
himself
to
rescue
his
precious
boy
or
to
crush
the
interfering
object
out
of
existence
with
what
was
left
to
him
of
raging
anger
he
turned
stood
up
and
flung
the
pasteur
aside
with
violence
he
raised
his
feet
to
stamp
and
kill
when
a
phrase
with
meaning
darted
suddenly
across
his
wild
confusion
and
recalled
him
to
some
fragment
of
truer
responsibility
and
life
there
ll
be
only
violence
in
him
reckless
violence
instead
of
strength
destructive
save
him
before
it
is
too
late
it
too
late
he
roared
in
answer
what
devil
hinders
me
but
his
roar
was
feeble
and
his
ironed
boots
refused
the
stamping
power
slipped
wholly
out
of
him
the
rhythm
poured
past
instead
of
through
him
interference
had
destroyed
the
circuit
more
glimmerings
of
responsibility
came
back
he
stooped
like
a
drunken
man
and
helped
the
other
to
his
feet
the
rapidity
of
the
change
was
curious
proving
that
the
spell
had
been
put
upon
him
from
without
it
was
not
as
with
the
boy
mere
development
of
tendencies
help
me
he
implored
suddenly
instead
help
me
there
has
been
madness
in
me
for
god
s
sake
help
me
to
get
him
out
it
seemed
the
face
of
the
old
marquess
stern
and
terrible
broke
an
instant
through
the
smoky
air
black
with
reproach
and
anger
and
with
a
violent
effort
of
the
will
hendricks
turned
round
to
face
the
elemental
orgy
bent
on
rescue
but
this
time
the
heat
was
intolerable
and
drove
him
back
the
hair
hitherto
untouched
now
singed
upon
his
head
fire
licked
his
very
breath
away
he
bent
double
covering
his
face
with
arms
and
cloak
pray
shouted
leysin
dropping
to
his
knees
it
is
the
only
way
my
god
is
higher
than
this
pray
pray
and
automatically
hendricks
fell
upon
his
knees
beside
him
though
to
pray
he
knew
not
how
for
no
real
faith
was
in
him
as
in
the
other
and
his
eye
was
far
from
single
the
fast
fading
grandeur
of
what
he
had
experienced
still
left
its
pagan
tumult
in
his
blood
the
pretence
of
prayer
could
only
have
been
blasphemy
he
watched
instead
letting
the
other
invoke
his
mighty
deity
alone
that
deity
he
had
served
unflinchingly
all
his
life
with
faith
and
fasting
and
with
belief
beyond
assault
it
was
an
impressive
picture
fraught
with
passionate
drama
on
his
knees
behind
a
sheltering
boulder
a
blackened
tossing
scorched
branches
above
his
head
this
righteous
man
prayed
to
his
god
sure
of
his
triumphant
answer
hendricks
watched
with
an
admiration
that
made
him
realise
his
own
insignificance
the
eyes
were
closed
the
leonine
big
head
set
firm
upon
the
diminutive
body
the
face
now
lit
by
flame
now
veiled
by
smoke
the
strong
hands
clasped
together
and
upraised
he
envied
him
he
recognised
too
that
the
elements
themselves
with
all
their
chaos
of
might
and
terror
were
after
all
but
servants
of
the
vastness
which
dips
the
butterflies
in
colour
and
puts
down
upon
the
breasts
of
little
robins
and
because
the
pasteur
s
life
had
been
always
prayer
in
action
his
little
human
will
invoked
the
will
of
greatness
merged
with
it
used
it
and
directed
it
steadily
against
the
commotion
of
these
unleashed
elements
certain
of
himself
and
of
his
god
the
pasteur
never
doubted
his
prayer
set
instantly
in
action
those
forces
which
balance
suns
and
keep
the
stars
afloat
thus
trembling
with
terror
that
made
him
wholly
ineffective
hendricks
watched
and
as
he
watched
became
aware
of
the
amazing
change
for
it
seemed
as
if
a
stream
of
power
steady
and
in
opposition
to
the
tumult
now
poured
audaciously
against
the
elemental
rhythm
altering
its
direction
modifying
gradually
its
stupendous
impetus
there
were
pauses
in
the
huge
vibrations
they
wavered
broke
and
fled
they
knew
confusion
as
when
the
prow
of
a
vessel
drives
against
the
tide
the
tide
is
vaster
but
the
steel
is
different
the
whole
sky
shivered
as
this
new
entering
force
so
small
so
soft
yet
of
such
incalculable
energy
began
at
once
its
overmastering
effect
signs
of
violence
or
rout
or
of
anything
disordered
had
no
part
in
it
excess
before
it
slipped
into
willing
harness
there
was
light
that
sponged
away
all
glare
as
when
morning
sunshine
cleans
a
forest
of
its
shadows
some
little
whispering
power
sang
marvellously
as
of
old
across
the
desolate
big
mountains
peace
be
still
turning
the
monstrous
turbulence
into
obedient
sweetness
and
upon
his
face
and
hands
hendricks
felt
faint
delicate
touches
of
some
refreshing
softness
that
he
could
not
understand
yet
not
instantly
was
this
harmony
restored
at
first
there
was
the
stress
of
vehement
opposition
the
night
of
wind
and
fire
drove
roaring
through
the
sky
there
were
bursts
of
triumphant
tumult
but
convulsion
in
them
and
no
true
steadiness
as
before
the
human
figures
hitherto
had
danced
with
that
fluid
appearance
which
belongs
to
fire
and
with
that
instantaneous
rush
which
is
of
wind
the
men
increasing
the
women
and
the
women
answering
with
joy
limbs
and
faces
had
melted
into
each
other
till
the
circular
ritual
looked
like
a
glowing
wheel
of
flame
rotating
audibly
but
slowly
now
the
speed
of
the
wheel
decreased
the
single
utterance
was
marred
by
the
crying
of
many
voices
all
at
different
pitch
discordant
inharmonious
dismayed
the
fires
somehow
dwindled
there
came
pauses
in
the
wind
and
hendricks
became
aware
of
a
curious
hissing
noise
as
more
and
more
of
these
odd
soft
touches
found
his
face
and
hands
here
and
there
he
saw
a
figure
stumbled
fell
then
gathered
itself
clumsily
together
again
with
a
frightened
shout
breaking
violently
out
of
the
circle
more
and
more
these
figures
blundered
and
dropped
out
and
although
they
returned
again
so
that
the
dance
apparently
increased
these
were
but
moments
in
the
final
violence
of
the
dispersing
hurricane
the
rejected
ones
dashed
back
wildly
into
the
wrong
places
men
and
women
no
longer
stood
alternate
but
in
groups
together
falsely
related
the
entire
movement
was
dislocated
the
ceremony
grew
rapidly
incoherent
meaning
forsook
it
the
composite
instrument
that
had
transmuted
the
elemental
forces
into
human
emotional
storage
was
imperfect
broken
out
of
tune
the
disarray
turned
rout
and
then
it
was
while
leysin
continued
without
ceasing
his
burning
and
successful
prayer
that
his
companion
conscious
of
returning
harmony
rose
to
his
feet
aware
suddenly
that
he
could
also
help
a
portion
of
the
powers
he
had
absorbed
still
worked
in
him
but
in
a
new
direction
he
felt
confident
and
unafraid
he
did
not
stumble
with
unerring
tread
he
advanced
towards
the
lessening
fires
feeling
as
he
did
so
the
cold
soft
touches
multiply
with
a
rush
upon
his
skin
from
all
sides
they
came
by
hundreds
like
messengers
of
help
ernest
he
cried
aloud
and
his
voice
though
little
raised
carried
resonantly
above
the
dying
turmoil
ernest
come
back
to
us
your
father
calls
you
and
from
threescore
faces
hurrying
in
confusion
through
the
smoke
one
paused
and
turned
it
stood
apart
hovering
as
though
in
air
while
the
mob
of
disordered
figures
rushed
in
a
body
along
the
ridge
plunging
like
frightened
cattle
below
the
farther
edge
then
vanishing
into
thick
darkness
they
left
behind
them
this
one
solitary
face
a
final
dying
flame
licked
out
at
it
a
rush
of
smoke
drove
past
to
hide
it
there
was
a
high
wild
scream
and
the
figure
shot
forward
with
a
headlong
leap
and
fell
with
a
crash
at
hendricks
feet
lord
ernie
blackened
by
smoke
and
scorched
by
fire
lay
safe
outside
the
danger
zone
and
hendricks
knelt
beside
him
remorse
and
shame
made
him
powerless
to
do
more
as
he
pulled
the
torn
clothing
over
the
neck
and
chest
and
heard
his
own
heart
begging
for
forgiveness
he
realised
his
own
weakness
and
faithlessness
a
great
temptation
had
found
him
wanting
it
was
owing
to
leysin
that
the
rescue
was
complete
the
pasteur
was
instantly
by
his
side
saved
as
by
water
he
cried
as
he
folded
his
cloak
about
the
prostrate
body
and
then
raised
the
head
and
shoulders
saved
by
his
ministers
of
rain
for
his
miracles
are
love
and
work
through
natural
he
made
a
sign
to
hendricks
carrying
the
boy
between
them
they
scrambled
down
the
slope
into
the
shelter
of
the
trees
below
the
cold
soft
touches
were
then
explained
the
had
dropped
as
suddenly
as
it
rose
and
the
torrential
rain
that
invariably
follows
now
poured
in
rivers
from
the
sky
water
drenching
the
fires
and
padding
the
savage
wind
had
stopped
the
dancers
midway
in
their
frenzied
ritual
it
was
the
element
they
dreaded
for
it
was
hostile
rain
soused
the
mountain
ridge
extinguishing
the
last
embers
of
the
numerous
fires
it
rushed
in
rivulets
between
their
feet
the
heated
earth
gave
out
a
hissing
steam
and
the
only
sound
in
the
spaces
where
wind
and
fire
had
boomed
and
thundered
a
little
while
before
was
now
the
splash
of
water
and
the
drip
of
quenching
drops
in
the
cover
of
the
sheltering
trees
the
body
stirred
lifted
its
head
and
sat
up
slowly
the
eyes
opened
i
m
cold
i
m
frightened
whispered
a
shivering
voice
where
am
i
only
the
pelt
and
thud
of
the
rain
sounded
behind
the
quavering
words
where
are
the
others
have
i
been
away
hendricks
hendricks
is
that
you
he
stared
about
him
his
face
now
a
mere
luminous
disc
in
the
thick
darkness
no
breath
of
wind
was
loose
they
spoke
to
him
till
he
answered
with
assurance
groping
to
find
their
hands
with
his
own
his
words
confused
and
strange
with
hidden
meaning
for
a
time
i
m
all
right
now
he
kept
repeating
i
know
exactly
it
was
one
of
my
big
dreams
i
suppose
i
fell
asleep
and
the
rain
woke
me
great
heavens
what
a
night
to
be
and
then
he
clambered
vigorously
to
his
feet
with
a
sudden
movement
of
great
energy
again
saying
that
hunger
was
in
him
and
he
must
eat
there
was
no
complaint
of
heat
or
cold
of
burning
or
of
bruises
the
boy
recovered
marvellously
in
ten
minutes
breaking
away
from
all
support
he
led
as
they
descended
through
the
dripping
forest
in
the
gloom
and
chill
of
very
early
morning
it
was
the
others
who
called
to
him
for
guidance
in
the
tangled
woods
lord
ernie
was
in
the
lead
throughout
the
difficult
woods
he
was
ever
in
front
and
singing
fire
that
lights
but
does
not
burn
and
wind
that
blows
the
heart
to
flame
they
both
are
in
me
now
for
ever
and
ever
oh
praise
the
lord
of
fire
and
the
lord
of
wind
and
this
voice
now
near
now
distant
sounding
through
the
dripping
forest
on
their
homeward
journey
was
an
experience
weird
and
unforgettable
for
those
other
two
leysin
it
seemed
had
one
sentence
only
which
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
heaven
grant
he
may
direct
it
all
for
good
for
they
have
filled
him
to
the
brim
and
he
is
become
an
instrument
of
but
hendricks
though
he
understood
the
risk
felt
only
confidence
lord
ernie
s
regeneration
had
begun
soaked
and
bedraggled
all
three
they
reached
the
village
about
two
o
clock
the
boy
utterly
unmanageable
said
an
emphatic
no
to
spirits
soup
or
medical
appliances
his
skin
indeed
showed
no
signs
of
burning
nor
was
there
the
smallest
symptom
of
cold
or
fever
in
him
i
m
a
perfect
furnace
he
laughed
i
feel
health
and
strength
and
the
brightness
of
his
eyes
his
radiant
colour
the
vigour
of
his
voice
and
manner
both
in
some
way
astonishing
made
all
pretence
of
assistance
unnecessary
and
absurd
it
s
like
a
new
birth
he
cried
to
hendricks
as
he
almost
cantered
beside
him
down
the
road
to
their
house
and
by
jove
i
ll
wake
em
up
at
home
and
make
the
world
go
round
i
know
a
hundred
schemes
i
tell
you
sir
i
m
simply
bursting
for
the
first
time
i
m
alive
and
an
hour
later
when
the
tutor
peeped
in
upon
him
the
boy
was
calmly
sleeping
the
shaded
carefully
with
one
hand
fell
upon
the
face
there
were
new
lines
and
a
new
expression
in
it
will
and
purpose
showed
in
the
stern
set
of
the
lips
and
jaw
it
was
the
face
of
a
man
and
of
a
man
one
would
not
lightly
trifle
with
purpose
will
and
power
were
established
on
their
thrones
to
such
a
man
the
entire
world
might
one
day
bow
the
head
if
only
it
will
last
thought
hendricks
as
shaken
bewildered
and
more
than
a
little
awed
he
tiptoed
out
of
the
room
again
and
went
to
bed
but
through
his
dreams
sheeted
in
flame
and
veiled
in
angry
smoke
the
face
of
the
old
marquess
glowered
upon
him
from
a
heavy
sky
above
ancestral
towers
xi
from
the
obituary
notices
of
the
marquess
of
oakham
the
following
selections
have
their
interest
he
succeeded
to
his
father
then
in
the
cabinet
as
minister
for
foreign
affairs
at
the
age
of
his
career
was
brief
but
singular
the
early
magnificence
of
the
younger
pitt
offering
a
standard
of
comparison
though
by
no
means
a
parallel
to
his
short
record
of
astonishing
achievement
his
effect
upon
the
world
first
as
chief
of
the
government
labour
department
and
subsequently
as
home
secretary
and
minister
of
war
is
described
as
shattering
even
cataclysmic
his
public
life
lasted
five
years
he
died
at
the
age
of
his
personality
was
revolutionary
and
overwhelming
for
judging
by
these
extracts
he
was
a
napoleonic
figure
whose
personal
influence
combined
the
impetus
of
mirabeau
and
the
dominance
of
alexander
his
authority
held
an
incalculable
element
precisely
described
as
uncanny
his
spirit
was
puissant
elemental
his
activity
yet
according
to
another
journal
he
was
properly
speaking
neither
intellectual
astute
nor
diplomatic
and
possessed
as
little
subtlety
as
might
be
expected
of
a
miner
whose
psychology
was
called
upon
to
explain
the
trinity
in
no
sense
was
he
statesman
and
even
less
strategist
yet
his
name
swept
europe
changed
the
map
of
the
nearer
east
its
mere
whisper
among
the
chancelleries
convulsing
men
s
counsels
with
an
influence
almost
his
enthusiasm
appears
to
have
been
amazing
some
stupendous
and
untiring
energy
drove
through
him
paralysing
attack
and
rendering
the
bitterest
and
most
skilful
opposition
nugatory
his
hand
was
imperious
upsetting
with
a
touch
the
chessboards
set
by
the
most
able
statecraft
and
his
voice
was
heard
with
a
kind
of
reverence
in
every
the
brevity
of
his
astonishing
career
called
for
universal
comment
as
did
the
hypnotising
effect
of
his
singular
ascendency
in
five
short
years
of
power
he
achieved
his
sway
he
rushed
upon
the
world
he
shook
it
he
retired
as
one
journal
picturesquely
phrased
it
the
manner
of
his
ending
moreover
a
stroke
of
lightning
seemed
in
keeping
with
his
life
there
was
neither
lingering
delay
nor
warning
of
distinguished
stock
noble
yet
ordinary
enough
in
all
but
name
his
power
is
unexplained
by
heredity
his
family
furnished
no
approach
to
greatness
as
history
supplied
no
parallel
to
his
dynamic
intensity
nor
we
are
informed
among
his
near
of
kin
does
any
inherit
his
volcanic
the
world
however
was
apparently
well
relieved
of
his
tumultuous
presence
for
his
influence
was
generally
surveyed
as
destructive
rather
than
he
was
unmarried
and
the
title
went
to
a
nephew
the
cheaper
journals
abounded
of
course
in
details
of
his
personal
and
private
life
that
were
freely
copied
into
the
foreign
press
and
supply
curious
material
for
the
student
of
human
nature
and
the
psychologist
the
amazing
revelations
no
doubt
were
picturesquely
exaggerated
yet
the
of
truth
in
them
all
was
generally
admitted
no
contradictions
at
any
rate
appeared
they
read
like
the
story
of
some
primitive
wild
giant
let
loose
upon
the
world
primitive
because
his
specific
brain
power
was
admittedly
of
no
high
order
wild
because
he
was
in
favour
of
fierce
spontaneous
action
and
his
mere
presence
on
occasions
could
stir
a
nation
not
alone
a
crowd
to
vehement
terrific
methods
his
energy
seemed
inexhaustible
his
fire
inextinguishable
legends
were
rife
even
before
he
died
among
the
peasantry
of
his
scotch
estates
that
he
was
in
league
with
the
devil
his
habit
of
keeping
enormous
fires
in
his
private
rooms
fires
that
burned
day
and
night
from
january
to
december
and
in
open
hearths
widened
to
thrice
their
natural
size
stimulated
the
growth
of
this
particular
myth
among
those
of
his
personal
environment
all
manner
of
stories
raged
but
it
was
his
strange
custom
that
provided
the
diabolical
suggestion
for
behind
a
specially
space
on
an
open
ridge
denuded
of
pines
in
a
distant
part
of
the
estate
a
series
of
gigantic
heaps
of
wood
all
ready
to
ignite
were
it
was
said
kept
in
a
state
of
constant
preparedness
and
on
stormy
nights
especially
when
winds
were
high
and
invariably
at
the
period
of
the
equinoctial
tempests
his
lordship
would
himself
light
these
tremendous
bonfires
and
spend
the
nocturnal
hours
in
their
blazing
presence
communing
the
stories
variously
relate
with
the
witches
at
their
sabbath
or
with
hordes
of
who
emerged
from
the
bottomless
pit
in
order
to
feed
his
soul
with
their
unquenchable
supplies
from
these
nightly
orgies
it
seems
clear
at
any
rate
he
returned
at
dawn
with
a
splendour
of
energy
that
no
one
could
resist
and
with
a
mien
whose
grandeur
invited
worship
rather
than
inspired
his
biography
it
was
further
stated
would
be
written
by
sir
john
hendricks
who
began
life
as
private
secretary
to
his
father
the
marquess
but
whose
rapid
rise
to
position
was
due
to
his
intimate
association
as
trusted
friend
and
adviser
to
the
subject
of
these
obituary
notices
the
biography
however
had
not
appeared
within
five
years
of
lord
oakham
s
sudden
death
and
curiosity
is
only
further
stimulated
by
the
suggestive
whisper
that
it
never
will
and
never
can
appear
the
sacrifice
i
limasson
was
a
religious
man
though
of
what
depth
and
quality
were
unknown
since
no
trial
of
ultimate
severity
had
yet
tested
him
an
adherent
of
no
particular
creed
he
yet
had
his
gods
and
his
was
probably
more
rigorous
than
his
friends
conjectured
he
was
so
reserved
few
guessed
perhaps
the
desires
conquered
the
passions
regulated
the
inner
tendencies
trained
and
schooled
not
by
denying
their
expression
but
by
transmuting
them
alchemically
into
nobler
channels
he
had
in
him
the
makings
of
an
enthusiastic
devotee
and
might
have
become
such
but
for
two
limitations
that
prevented
he
loved
his
wealth
labouring
to
increase
it
to
the
neglect
of
other
interests
and
secondly
instead
of
following
up
one
steady
line
of
search
he
scattered
himself
upon
many
picturesque
theories
like
an
actor
who
wants
to
play
all
parts
rather
than
concentrate
on
one
and
the
more
picturesque
the
part
the
more
he
was
attracted
thus
though
he
did
his
duty
unshrinkingly
and
with
a
touch
of
love
he
accused
himself
sometimes
of
merely
gratifying
a
sensuous
taste
in
spiritual
sensations
there
was
this
unbalance
in
him
that
argued
want
of
depth
as
for
his
gods
in
the
end
he
discovered
their
reality
by
first
doubting
then
denying
their
existence
it
was
this
denial
and
doubt
that
restored
them
to
their
thrones
converting
his
dilettante
skirmishes
into
genuine
deep
belief
and
the
proof
came
to
him
one
summer
in
early
june
when
he
was
making
ready
to
leave
town
for
his
annual
month
among
the
mountains
with
limasson
mountains
in
some
inexplicable
sense
were
a
passion
almost
and
climbing
so
deep
a
pleasure
that
the
ordinary
scrambler
hardly
understood
it
grave
as
a
kind
of
worship
it
was
to
him
the
preparations
for
an
ascent
the
ascent
itself
in
particular
involved
a
concentration
that
seemed
symbolical
as
of
a
ritual
he
not
only
loved
the
heights
the
massive
grandeur
the
splendour
of
vast
proportions
blocked
in
space
but
loved
them
with
a
respect
that
held
a
touch
of
awe
the
emotion
mountains
stirred
in
him
one
might
say
was
of
that
profound
incalculable
kind
that
held
kinship
with
his
religious
feelings
half
realised
though
these
were
his
gods
had
their
invisible
thrones
somewhere
among
the
grim
forbidding
heights
he
prepared
himself
for
this
annual
mountaineering
with
the
same
earnestness
that
a
holy
man
might
approach
a
solemn
festival
of
his
church
and
the
impetus
of
his
mind
was
running
with
big
momentum
in
this
direction
when
there
fell
upon
him
almost
on
the
eve
of
starting
a
swift
series
of
disasters
that
shook
his
being
to
its
last
foundations
and
left
him
stunned
among
the
ruins
to
describe
these
is
unnecessary
people
said
one
thing
after
another
like
that
what
appalling
luck
poor
wretch
then
wondered
with
the
curiosity
of
children
how
in
the
world
he
would
take
it
due
to
no
apparent
fault
of
his
own
these
disasters
were
so
sudden
that
life
seemed
in
a
moment
shattered
and
his
interest
in
existence
almost
ceased
people
shook
their
heads
and
thought
of
the
emergency
exit
but
limasson
was
too
vital
a
man
to
dream
of
annihilation
upon
him
it
had
a
different
effect
he
turned
and
questioned
what
he
called
his
gods
they
did
not
answer
or
explain
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
doubted
a
hair
s
breadth
beyond
lay
definite
denial
the
ruin
in
which
he
sat
however
was
not
material
no
man
of
his
age
possessed
of
courage
and
a
working
scheme
of
life
would
permit
disaster
of
a
material
order
to
overwhelm
him
it
was
collapse
of
a
mental
spiritual
kind
an
assault
upon
the
roots
of
character
and
temperament
moral
duties
laid
suddenly
upon
him
threatened
to
crush
his
existence
was
assailed
and
apparently
must
end
he
must
spend
the
remainder
of
his
life
caring
for
others
who
were
nothing
to
him
no
outlet
showed
no
way
of
escape
so
diabolically
complete
was
the
combination
of
events
that
rushed
his
inner
trenches
his
faith
was
shaken
a
man
can
but
endure
so
much
and
remain
human
for
him
the
saturation
point
seemed
reached
he
experienced
the
spiritual
equivalent
of
that
physical
numbness
which
supervenes
when
pain
has
touched
the
limit
of
endurance
he
laughed
grew
callous
then
mocked
his
silent
gods
it
is
said
that
upon
this
state
of
blank
negation
there
follows
sometimes
a
condition
of
lucidity
which
mirrors
with
crystal
clearness
the
forces
driving
behind
life
at
a
given
moment
a
kind
of
clairvoyance
that
brings
explanation
and
therefore
peace
limasson
looked
for
this
in
vain
there
was
the
doubt
that
questioned
there
was
the
sneer
that
mocked
the
silence
into
which
his
questions
fell
but
there
was
neither
answer
nor
explanation
and
certainly
not
peace
there
was
no
relief
in
this
tumult
of
revolt
he
did
none
of
the
things
his
friends
suggested
or
expected
he
merely
followed
the
line
of
least
resistance
he
yielded
to
the
impetus
that
was
upon
him
when
the
catastrophe
came
to
their
indignant
amazement
he
went
out
to
his
mountains
all
marvelled
that
at
such
a
time
he
could
adopt
so
trivial
a
line
of
action
neglecting
duties
that
seemed
paramount
they
disapproved
yet
in
reality
he
was
taking
no
definite
action
at
all
but
merely
drifting
with
the
momentum
that
had
been
acquired
just
before
he
was
bewildered
with
so
much
pain
confused
with
suffering
stunned
with
the
crash
that
flung
him
helpless
amid
undeserved
calamity
he
turned
to
the
mountains
as
a
child
to
its
mother
instinctively
mountains
had
never
failed
to
bring
him
consolation
comfort
peace
their
grandeur
restored
proportion
whenever
disorder
threatened
life
no
calculation
properly
speaking
was
in
his
move
at
all
but
a
blind
desire
for
a
violent
physical
reaction
such
as
climbing
brings
and
the
instinct
was
more
wholesome
than
he
knew
in
the
high
upland
valley
among
lonely
peaks
whither
limasson
then
went
he
found
in
some
measure
the
proportion
he
had
lost
he
studiously
avoided
thinking
he
lived
in
his
muscles
recklessly
the
region
with
its
little
inn
was
familiar
to
him
peak
after
peak
he
attacked
sometimes
with
but
more
often
without
a
guide
until
his
reputation
as
a
sane
climber
a
laurelled
member
of
all
the
foreign
alpine
clubs
was
seriously
in
danger
that
he
overdid
it
physically
is
beyond
question
but
that
the
mountains
breathed
into
him
some
portion
of
their
enormous
calm
and
deep
endurance
is
also
true
his
gods
meanwhile
he
neglected
utterly
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
if
he
thought
of
them
at
all
it
was
as
tinsel
figures
imagination
had
created
figures
upon
a
stage
that
merely
decorated
life
for
those
whom
pretty
pictures
pleased
only
he
had
left
the
theatre
and
their
no
longer
hypnotised
his
mind
he
realised
their
impotence
and
disowned
them
this
attitude
however
was
subconscious
he
lent
to
it
no
substance
either
of
thought
or
speech
he
ignored
rather
than
challenged
their
existence
and
it
was
somewhat
in
this
frame
of
mind
thinking
little
feeling
even
less
that
he
came
out
into
the
hotel
vestibule
after
dinner
one
evening
and
took
mechanically
the
bundle
of
letters
the
porter
handed
to
him
they
had
no
possible
interest
for
him
in
a
corner
where
the
big
mitigated
the
chilliness
of
the
hall
he
idly
sorted
them
the
score
or
so
of
other
guests
chiefly
expert
climbing
men
were
trailing
out
in
twos
and
threes
from
the
but
he
felt
as
little
interest
in
them
as
in
his
letters
no
conversation
could
alter
facts
no
written
phrases
change
his
circumstances
at
random
then
he
opened
a
business
letter
with
a
typewritten
address
it
would
probably
be
impersonal
less
of
a
mockery
therefore
than
the
others
with
their
tiresome
sham
condolences
and
in
a
sense
it
was
impersonal
sympathy
from
a
solicitor
s
office
is
mere
formula
a
few
extra
ticks
upon
the
universal
keyboard
of
a
remington
but
as
he
read
it
limasson
made
a
discovery
that
startled
him
into
acute
and
bitter
sensation
he
had
imagined
the
limit
of
bearable
suffering
and
disaster
already
reached
now
in
a
few
dozen
words
his
error
was
proved
convincingly
the
fresh
blow
was
dislocating
this
culminating
news
of
additional
catastrophe
disclosed
within
him
entirely
new
reaches
of
pain
of
biting
resentful
fury
limasson
experienced
a
momentary
stopping
of
the
heart
as
he
took
it
in
a
dizziness
a
violent
sensation
of
revolt
whose
impotence
induced
almost
physical
nausea
he
felt
like
death
must
i
suffer
all
things
flashed
through
his
arrested
intelligence
in
letters
of
fire
there
was
a
sullen
rage
in
him
a
dazed
bewilderment
but
no
positive
suffering
as
yet
his
emotion
was
too
sickening
to
include
the
smaller
pains
of
disappointment
it
was
primitive
blind
anger
that
he
knew
he
read
the
letter
calmly
even
to
the
neat
paragraph
of
sympathy
at
the
last
then
placed
it
in
his
inner
pocket
no
outward
sign
of
disturbance
was
upon
him
his
breath
came
slowly
he
reached
over
to
the
table
for
a
match
holding
it
at
arm
s
length
lest
the
sulphur
fumes
should
sting
his
nostrils
and
in
that
moment
he
made
his
second
discovery
the
fact
that
further
suffering
was
still
possible
included
also
the
fact
that
some
touch
of
resignation
had
been
left
in
him
and
therefore
some
vestige
of
belief
as
well
now
as
he
felt
the
crackling
sheet
of
stiff
paper
in
his
pocket
watched
the
sulphur
die
and
saw
the
wood
ignite
this
remnant
faded
utterly
away
like
the
blackened
end
of
the
match
it
shrivelled
and
dropped
off
it
vanished
savagely
yet
with
an
external
calmness
that
enabled
him
to
light
his
pipe
with
untrembling
hand
he
addressed
his
futile
deities
and
once
more
in
fiery
letters
there
flashed
across
the
darkness
of
his
passionate
thought
even
this
you
demand
of
me
this
cruel
ultimate
sacrifice
and
he
rejected
them
bag
and
baggage
for
they
were
a
mockery
and
a
lie
with
contempt
he
repudiated
them
for
ever
the
stage
of
doubt
had
passed
he
denied
his
gods
yet
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
for
what
were
they
after
all
but
the
puppets
his
religious
fancy
had
imagined
they
never
had
existed
was
it
then
merely
the
picturesque
sensational
aspect
of
his
devotional
temperament
that
had
created
them
that
side
of
his
nature
in
any
case
was
dead
now
killed
by
a
single
devastating
blow
the
gods
went
with
it
surveying
what
remained
of
his
life
it
seemed
to
him
like
a
city
that
an
earthquake
has
reduced
to
ruins
the
inhabitants
think
no
worse
thing
could
happen
then
comes
the
fire
two
lines
of
thought
it
seems
then
developed
parallel
in
him
and
simultaneously
for
while
underneath
he
stormed
against
this
culminating
blow
his
upper
mind
dealt
calmly
with
the
project
of
a
great
expedition
he
would
make
at
dawn
he
had
engaged
no
guide
as
an
experienced
mountaineer
he
knew
the
district
well
his
name
was
tolerably
familiar
and
in
half
an
hour
he
could
have
settled
all
details
and
retired
to
bed
with
instructions
to
be
called
at
two
but
instead
he
sat
there
waiting
unable
to
stir
a
human
volcano
that
any
moment
might
break
forth
into
violence
he
smoked
his
pipe
as
quietly
as
though
nothing
had
happened
while
through
the
blazing
depths
of
him
ran
ever
this
one
statement
even
this
you
demand
of
me
this
cruel
ultimate
sacrifice
his
dynamically
estimated
just
then
must
have
been
very
great
and
thus
repressed
the
store
of
potential
energy
accumulated
enormously
with
thought
concentrated
largely
upon
this
final
blow
limasson
had
not
noticed
the
people
who
streamed
out
of
the
à
and
scattered
themselves
in
groups
about
the
hall
some
individual
now
and
again
approached
his
chair
with
the
idea
of
conversation
then
seeing
his
absorption
turned
away
even
when
a
climber
whom
he
slightly
knew
reached
across
him
with
a
word
of
apology
for
the
matches
limasson
made
no
response
for
he
did
not
see
him
he
noticed
nothing
in
particular
he
did
not
notice
two
men
who
from
an
opposite
corner
had
for
some
time
been
observing
him
he
now
looked
up
by
chance
and
was
vaguely
aware
that
they
were
discussing
him
he
met
their
eyes
across
the
hall
and
started
for
at
first
he
thought
he
knew
them
possibly
he
had
seen
them
about
in
the
hotel
they
seemed
familiar
yet
he
certainly
had
never
spoken
with
them
aware
of
his
mistake
he
turned
his
glance
elsewhere
though
still
vividly
conscious
of
their
attention
one
was
a
clergyman
or
a
priest
his
face
wore
an
air
of
gravity
touched
by
sadness
a
sternness
about
the
lips
counteracted
by
a
kindling
beauty
in
the
eyes
that
betrayed
enthusiasm
nobly
regulated
there
was
a
suggestion
of
stateliness
in
the
man
that
made
the
impression
very
sharp
his
clothing
emphasised
it
he
wore
a
dark
tweed
suit
that
was
strict
in
its
simplicity
there
was
austerity
in
him
somewhere
his
companion
perhaps
by
contrast
seemed
inconsiderable
in
his
conventional
evening
dress
a
good
deal
younger
than
his
friend
his
hair
always
a
detail
was
a
trifle
long
the
thin
fingers
that
flourished
a
cigarette
wore
rings
the
face
though
picturesque
was
flippant
and
his
entire
attitude
conveyed
a
certain
insignificance
gesture
that
faultless
language
which
challenges
counterfeit
betrayed
unbalance
somewhere
the
impression
he
produced
however
was
shadowy
compared
to
the
sharpness
of
the
other
theatrical
was
the
word
in
limasson
s
mind
as
he
turned
his
glance
elsewhere
but
as
he
looked
away
he
fidgeted
the
interior
darkness
caused
by
the
dreadful
letter
rose
about
him
it
engulfed
him
dizziness
came
with
it
far
away
the
blackness
was
fringed
with
light
and
through
this
light
stepping
with
speed
and
carelessness
as
from
gigantic
distance
the
two
men
suddenly
grown
large
came
at
him
limasson
in
turned
to
meet
them
conversation
he
did
not
desire
somehow
he
had
expected
this
attack
yet
the
instant
they
began
to
speak
it
was
the
priest
who
opened
fire
it
was
all
so
natural
and
easy
that
he
almost
welcomed
the
diversion
a
phrase
by
way
of
introduction
and
he
was
speaking
of
the
summits
something
in
limasson
s
mind
turned
over
the
man
was
a
serious
climber
one
of
his
own
species
the
sufferer
felt
a
certain
relief
as
he
heard
the
invitation
and
realised
though
dully
the
compliment
involved
if
you
felt
inclined
to
join
us
if
you
would
honour
us
with
your
company
the
man
was
saying
quietly
adding
something
then
about
your
great
experience
and
invaluable
advice
and
limasson
looked
up
trying
hard
to
concentrate
and
understand
the
tour
du
néant
he
repeated
mentioning
the
peak
proposed
rarely
attempted
never
conquered
and
with
an
ominous
record
of
disaster
it
happened
to
be
the
very
summit
he
had
meant
to
attack
himself
next
day
you
have
engaged
guides
he
knew
the
question
foolish
no
guide
will
try
it
the
priest
answered
smiling
while
his
companion
added
with
a
flourish
but
we
we
need
no
guide
if
will
you
are
unattached
i
believe
you
are
alone
the
priest
enquired
moving
a
little
in
front
of
his
friend
as
though
to
keep
him
in
the
background
yes
replied
limasson
i
am
quite
he
was
listening
attentively
but
with
only
part
of
his
mind
he
realised
the
flattery
of
the
invitation
yet
it
was
like
flattery
addressed
to
some
one
else
he
felt
himself
so
indifferent
so
dead
these
men
wanted
his
skilful
body
his
experienced
mind
and
it
was
his
body
and
mind
that
talked
with
them
and
finally
agreed
to
go
many
a
time
expeditions
had
been
planned
in
just
this
way
but
he
felt
there
was
a
difference
mind
and
body
signed
the
agreement
but
his
soul
listening
elsewhere
and
looking
on
was
silent
with
his
rejected
gods
it
had
left
him
though
hovering
close
still
it
did
not
interfere
it
did
not
warn
it
even
approved
it
sang
to
him
from
great
distance
that
this
expedition
cloaked
another
he
was
bewildered
by
the
clashing
of
his
higher
and
his
lower
mind
at
one
in
the
morning
then
if
that
will
suit
you
the
older
man
concluded
i
ll
see
to
the
provisions
exclaimed
the
younger
enthusiastically
and
i
shall
take
my
telephoto
for
the
summit
the
porters
can
come
as
far
as
the
great
tower
we
re
over
six
thousand
feet
here
already
you
see
so
and
his
voice
died
away
in
the
distance
as
his
companion
led
him
off
limasson
saw
him
go
with
relief
but
for
the
other
man
he
would
have
declined
the
invitation
at
heart
he
was
indifferent
enough
what
decided
him
really
was
the
coincidence
that
the
tour
du
néant
was
the
very
peak
he
had
intended
to
attack
himself
and
the
curious
feeling
that
this
expedition
cloaked
another
somehow
almost
that
these
men
had
a
hidden
motive
but
he
dismissed
the
idea
it
was
not
worth
thinking
about
a
moment
later
he
followed
them
to
bed
so
careless
was
he
of
the
affairs
of
the
world
so
dead
to
mundane
interests
that
he
tore
up
his
other
letters
and
tossed
them
into
a
corner
of
the
room
unread
ii
once
in
his
chilly
bedroom
he
realised
that
his
upper
mind
had
permitted
him
to
do
a
foolish
thing
he
had
drifted
like
a
schoolboy
into
an
unwise
situation
he
had
pledged
himself
to
an
expedition
with
two
strangers
an
expedition
for
which
normally
he
would
have
chosen
his
companions
with
the
utmost
caution
moreover
he
was
guide
they
looked
to
him
for
safety
while
yet
it
was
they
who
had
arranged
and
planned
it
but
who
were
these
men
with
whom
he
proposed
to
run
grave
bodily
risks
he
knew
them
as
little
as
they
knew
him
whence
came
he
wondered
the
curious
idea
that
this
climb
was
really
planned
by
another
who
was
no
one
of
them
the
thought
slipped
idly
across
his
mind
going
out
by
one
door
it
came
back
however
quickly
by
another
he
did
not
think
about
it
more
than
to
note
its
passage
through
the
disorder
that
passed
with
him
just
then
for
thinking
indeed
there
was
nothing
in
the
whole
world
for
which
he
cared
a
single
brass
farthing
as
he
undressed
for
bed
he
said
to
himself
i
shall
be
called
at
one
but
why
am
i
going
with
these
two
on
this
wild
plan
and
who
made
the
plan
it
seemed
to
have
settled
itself
it
came
about
so
naturally
and
easily
so
quickly
he
probed
no
deeper
he
didn
t
care
and
for
the
first
time
he
omitted
the
little
ritual
half
prayer
half
adoration
it
had
always
been
his
custom
to
offer
to
his
deities
upon
retiring
to
rest
he
no
longer
recognised
them
how
utterly
broken
his
life
was
how
blank
and
terrible
and
lonely
he
felt
cold
and
piled
his
overcoats
upon
the
bed
as
though
his
mental
isolation
involved
a
physical
effect
as
well
switching
off
the
light
by
the
door
he
was
in
the
act
of
crossing
the
floor
in
the
darkness
when
a
sound
beneath
the
window
caught
his
ear
outside
there
were
voices
talking
the
roar
of
falling
water
made
them
indistinct
yet
he
was
sure
they
were
voices
and
that
one
of
them
he
knew
he
stopped
still
to
listen
he
heard
his
own
name
uttered
john
they
ceased
he
stood
a
moment
shivering
on
the
boards
then
crawled
into
bed
beneath
the
heavy
clothing
but
in
the
act
of
settling
down
they
began
again
he
raised
himself
again
hurriedly
to
listen
what
little
wind
there
was
passed
in
that
moment
down
the
valley
carrying
off
the
roar
of
falling
water
and
into
the
moment
s
space
of
silence
dropped
fragments
of
definite
sentences
they
are
close
you
say
close
down
upon
the
world
it
was
the
voice
of
the
priest
surely
for
days
they
have
been
passing
was
the
answer
a
rough
deep
tone
that
might
have
been
a
peasant
s
and
a
kind
of
fear
in
it
for
all
my
flocks
are
the
signs
are
sure
you
know
them
tumult
was
the
answer
in
much
lower
tones
there
has
been
tumult
in
the
mountains
there
was
a
break
then
as
though
the
voices
sank
too
low
to
be
heard
two
broken
fragments
came
next
end
of
a
question
beginning
of
an
answer
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
if
he
goes
of
his
own
free
will
success
is
sure
for
acceptance
is
and
the
wind
returning
bore
back
the
sound
of
the
falling
water
so
that
limasson
heard
no
more
an
indefinable
emotion
stirred
in
him
as
he
turned
over
to
sleep
he
stuffed
his
ears
lest
he
should
hear
more
he
was
aware
of
a
sinking
of
the
heart
that
was
inexplicable
what
in
the
world
were
they
talking
about
these
two
what
was
the
meaning
of
these
disjointed
phrases
there
lay
behind
them
a
grave
significance
almost
solemn
that
tumult
in
the
mountains
was
somehow
ominous
its
suggestion
terrible
and
mighty
he
felt
disturbed
uncomfortable
the
first
emotion
that
had
stirred
in
him
for
days
the
numbness
melted
before
its
faint
awakening
conscience
was
in
it
he
felt
vague
prickings
but
it
was
deeper
far
than
conscience
somewhere
out
of
sight
in
a
region
life
had
as
yet
not
plumbed
the
words
sank
down
and
vibrated
like
pedal
notes
they
rumbled
away
into
the
night
of
undecipherable
things
and
though
explanation
failed
him
he
felt
they
had
reference
somehow
to
the
morrow
s
expedition
how
what
wherefore
he
knew
not
his
name
had
been
spoken
then
these
curious
sentences
that
was
all
yet
s
expedition
what
was
it
but
an
expedition
of
impersonal
kind
not
even
planned
by
himself
merely
his
own
plan
taken
and
altered
by
others
made
over
his
personal
business
his
personal
life
were
not
really
in
it
at
all
the
thought
startled
him
a
moment
he
had
no
personal
life
struggling
with
sleep
his
brain
played
the
endless
game
of
disentanglement
without
winning
a
single
point
while
the
in
him
looked
on
and
smiled
because
it
then
suddenly
a
great
peace
fell
over
him
exhaustion
brought
it
perhaps
he
fell
asleep
and
next
moment
it
seemed
he
was
aware
of
a
thundering
at
the
door
and
an
unwelcome
growling
voice
s
ist
bald
ein
uhr
herr
aufstehen
rising
at
such
an
hour
unless
the
heart
be
in
it
is
a
sordid
and
depressing
business
limasson
dressed
without
enthusiasm
conscious
that
thought
and
feeling
were
exactly
where
he
had
left
them
on
going
to
sleep
the
same
confusion
and
bewilderment
were
in
him
also
the
same
deep
solemn
emotion
stirred
by
the
whispering
voices
only
long
habit
enabled
him
to
attend
to
detail
and
ensured
that
nothing
was
forgotten
he
felt
heavy
and
oppressed
a
kind
of
anxiety
about
him
the
routine
of
preparation
he
followed
gravely
utterly
untouched
by
the
customary
joy
it
was
mechanical
yet
through
it
ran
the
old
familiar
sense
of
ritual
due
to
the
practice
of
so
many
years
that
cleansing
of
mind
and
body
for
a
big
ascent
like
initiatory
rites
that
once
had
been
as
important
to
him
as
those
of
some
priest
who
approached
the
worship
of
his
deity
in
the
temples
of
ancient
time
he
performed
the
ceremony
with
the
same
care
as
though
no
ghost
of
vanished
faith
still
watched
him
beckoning
from
the
air
as
formerly
his
knapsack
carefully
packed
he
took
his
from
beside
the
bed
turned
out
the
light
and
went
down
the
creaking
wooden
stairs
in
stockinged
feet
lest
his
heavy
boots
should
waken
the
other
sleepers
and
in
his
head
still
rang
the
phrase
he
had
fallen
asleep
on
as
though
just
uttered
the
signs
are
sure
for
days
they
have
been
passing
close
down
upon
the
world
the
flocks
are
scattered
there
has
been
tumult
tumult
in
the
the
other
fragments
he
had
forgotten
but
who
were
they
and
why
did
the
word
bring
a
chill
of
awe
into
his
blood
and
as
the
words
rolled
through
him
limasson
felt
tumult
in
his
thoughts
and
feelings
too
there
had
been
tumult
in
his
life
and
all
his
joys
were
scattered
joys
that
hitherto
had
fed
his
days
the
signs
were
sure
something
was
close
down
upon
his
little
world
passing
sweeping
he
felt
a
touch
of
terror
outside
in
the
fresh
darkness
of
very
early
morning
the
strangers
stood
waiting
for
him
rather
they
seemed
to
arrive
in
the
same
instant
as
himself
equally
punctual
the
clock
in
the
church
tower
sounded
one
they
exchanged
low
greetings
remarked
that
the
weather
promised
to
hold
good
and
started
off
in
single
file
over
soaking
meadows
towards
the
first
belt
of
forest
the
porter
mere
peasant
unfamiliar
of
face
and
not
connected
with
the
hotel
led
the
way
with
a
hurricane
lantern
the
air
was
marvellously
sweet
and
fragrant
in
the
sky
overhead
the
stars
shone
in
their
thousands
only
the
noise
of
falling
water
from
the
heights
and
the
regular
thud
of
their
heavy
boots
broke
the
stillness
and
black
against
the
sky
towered
the
enormous
pyramid
of
the
tour
du
néant
they
meant
to
conquer
perhaps
the
most
delightful
portion
of
a
big
ascent
is
the
beginning
in
the
scented
darkness
while
the
thrill
of
possible
conquest
lies
still
far
off
the
hours
stretch
themselves
queerly
last
night
s
sunset
might
be
days
ago
sunrise
and
the
brilliance
coming
seem
in
another
week
part
of
dim
futurity
like
children
s
holidays
it
is
difficult
to
realise
that
this
biting
cold
before
the
dawn
and
the
blazing
heat
to
come
both
belong
to
the
same
there
were
no
sounds
as
they
toiled
slowly
up
the
zigzag
path
through
the
first
fifteen
hundred
feet
of
no
one
spoke
the
clink
of
nails
and
points
against
the
stones
was
all
they
heard
for
the
roar
of
water
was
felt
rather
than
heard
it
beat
against
the
ears
and
the
skin
of
the
whole
body
at
once
the
deeper
notes
were
below
them
now
in
the
sleeping
valley
the
shriller
ones
sounded
far
above
where
streams
just
born
out
of
ponderous
tinkled
sharply
the
change
came
delicately
the
stars
turned
a
shade
less
brilliant
a
softness
in
them
as
of
human
eyes
that
say
farewell
between
the
highest
branches
the
sky
grew
visible
a
sighing
air
smoothed
all
their
crests
one
way
moss
earth
and
open
spaces
brought
keen
perfumes
and
the
little
human
procession
leaving
the
forest
stepped
out
into
the
vastness
of
the
world
above
the
they
paused
while
the
porter
stooped
to
put
his
lantern
out
in
the
eastern
sky
was
colour
the
peaks
and
crags
rushed
closer
was
it
the
dawn
limasson
turned
his
eyes
from
the
height
of
sky
where
the
summits
pierced
a
path
for
the
coming
day
to
the
faces
of
his
companions
pale
and
wan
in
the
early
twilight
how
small
how
insignificant
they
seemed
amid
this
hungry
emptiness
of
desolation
the
stupendous
cliffs
fled
past
them
led
by
headstrong
peaks
crowned
with
eternal
snows
thin
lines
of
cloud
trailing
half
way
up
precipice
and
ridge
seemed
like
the
swish
of
movement
as
though
he
caught
the
earth
turning
as
she
raced
through
space
the
four
of
them
timid
riders
on
the
gigantic
saddle
clung
for
their
lives
against
her
titan
ribs
while
currents
of
some
majestic
life
swept
up
at
them
from
every
side
he
drew
deep
draughts
of
the
rarefied
air
into
his
lungs
it
was
very
cold
avoiding
the
pallid
insignificant
faces
of
his
companions
he
pretended
interest
in
the
porter
s
operations
he
stared
fixedly
on
the
ground
it
seemed
twenty
minutes
before
the
flame
was
extinguished
and
the
lantern
fastened
to
the
pack
behind
this
dawn
was
unlike
any
he
had
seen
before
for
in
reality
all
the
while
limasson
was
trying
to
bring
order
out
of
the
extraordinary
thoughts
and
feelings
that
had
possessed
him
during
the
slow
forest
ascent
and
the
task
was
not
crowned
with
much
success
the
plan
made
by
others
had
taken
charge
of
him
he
felt
and
he
had
thrown
the
reins
of
personal
will
and
interest
loosely
upon
its
steady
gait
he
had
abandoned
himself
carelessly
to
what
might
come
knowing
that
he
was
leader
of
the
expedition
he
yet
had
suffered
the
porter
to
go
first
taking
his
own
place
as
it
was
appointed
to
him
behind
the
younger
man
but
before
the
priest
in
this
order
they
had
plodded
as
only
experienced
climbers
plod
for
hours
without
a
rest
until
half
way
up
a
change
had
taken
place
he
had
wished
it
and
instantly
it
was
effected
the
priest
moved
past
him
while
his
companion
dropped
to
the
rear
the
companion
who
forever
stumbled
in
his
speed
whereas
the
older
man
climbed
surely
confidently
and
thereafter
limasson
walked
more
easily
as
though
the
relative
positions
of
the
three
were
of
importance
somehow
the
steep
ascent
of
smothering
darkness
through
the
woods
became
less
arduous
he
was
glad
to
have
the
younger
man
behind
him
for
the
impression
had
strengthened
as
they
climbed
in
silence
that
this
ascent
pertained
to
some
significant
ceremony
and
the
idea
had
grown
insistently
almost
stealthily
upon
him
the
movements
of
himself
and
his
companions
especially
the
positions
each
occupied
relatively
to
the
other
established
some
kind
of
intimacy
that
resembled
speech
suggesting
even
question
and
answer
and
the
entire
performance
while
occupying
hours
by
his
watch
it
seemed
to
him
more
than
once
had
been
in
reality
briefer
than
the
flash
of
a
passing
thought
so
that
he
saw
it
within
himself
pictorially
he
thought
of
a
picture
worked
in
colours
upon
a
strip
of
elastic
some
one
pulled
the
strip
and
the
picture
stretched
or
some
one
released
it
again
and
the
picture
flew
back
reduced
to
a
mere
stationary
speck
all
happened
in
a
single
speck
of
time
and
the
little
change
of
position
apparently
so
trivial
gave
point
to
this
singular
notion
working
in
his
that
this
ascent
was
a
ritual
and
a
ceremony
as
in
older
days
its
significance
approaching
revelation
however
for
the
first
time
now
without
language
this
stole
over
him
no
words
could
quite
describe
it
for
it
came
to
him
that
these
three
formed
a
unit
himself
being
in
some
fashion
yet
the
acknowledged
principal
the
leader
the
labouring
porter
had
no
place
in
it
for
this
first
toiling
through
the
darkness
was
a
preparation
and
when
the
actual
climb
began
he
would
disappear
while
limasson
himself
went
first
this
idea
that
they
took
part
together
in
a
ceremony
established
itself
firmly
in
him
with
the
added
wonder
that
though
so
often
done
he
performed
it
now
for
the
first
time
with
full
comprehension
knowledge
truth
empty
of
personal
desire
indifferent
to
an
ascent
that
formerly
would
have
thrilled
his
heart
with
ambition
and
delight
he
understood
that
climbing
had
ever
been
a
ritual
for
his
soul
and
of
his
soul
and
that
power
must
result
from
its
sincere
accomplishment
it
was
a
symbolical
ascent
in
words
this
did
not
come
to
him
he
felt
it
never
criticising
that
is
he
neither
rejected
nor
accepted
it
stole
most
sweetly
grandly
over
him
it
floated
into
him
while
he
climbed
yet
so
convincingly
that
he
had
felt
his
relative
position
must
be
changed
the
younger
man
held
too
prominent
a
post
or
at
least
a
wrong
one
in
advance
then
after
the
change
effected
mysteriously
as
though
all
recognised
it
this
line
of
certainty
increased
and
there
came
upon
him
the
big
strange
knowledge
that
all
of
life
is
a
ceremony
on
a
giant
scale
and
that
by
performing
the
movements
accurately
with
sincere
fidelity
there
may
come
knowledge
there
was
gravity
in
him
from
that
moment
this
ran
in
his
mind
with
certainty
though
his
thought
assumed
no
form
of
little
phrases
his
brain
yet
furnished
detailed
statements
that
clinched
the
marvellous
thing
with
simile
and
incident
which
daily
life
might
apprehend
that
knowledge
arises
from
action
that
to
do
the
thing
invites
the
teaching
and
explains
it
action
moreover
is
symbolical
a
group
of
men
a
family
an
entire
nation
engaged
in
those
daily
movements
which
are
the
working
out
of
their
destiny
perform
a
ceremony
which
is
in
direct
relation
somewhere
to
the
pattern
of
greater
happenings
which
are
the
teachings
of
the
gods
let
the
body
imitate
reproduce
in
a
bedroom
in
a
wood
anywhere
the
movements
of
the
stars
and
the
meaning
of
those
stars
shall
sink
down
into
the
heart
the
movements
constitute
a
script
a
language
to
mimic
the
gestures
of
a
stranger
is
to
understand
his
mood
his
point
of
view
to
establish
a
grave
and
solemn
intimacy
temples
are
everywhere
for
the
entire
earth
is
a
temple
and
the
body
house
of
royalty
is
the
biggest
temple
of
them
all
to
ascertain
the
pattern
its
movements
trace
in
daily
life
be
to
determine
the
relation
of
that
particular
ceremony
to
the
cosmos
and
so
learn
power
the
entire
system
of
pythagoras
he
realised
could
be
taught
without
a
single
word
by
movements
and
in
everyday
life
even
the
commonest
act
and
vulgarest
movement
are
part
of
some
big
ceremony
a
message
from
the
gods
ceremony
in
a
word
is
language
and
action
therefore
is
the
language
of
the
gods
the
gods
he
had
denied
were
speaking
to
him
passing
with
tumult
close
across
his
broken
life
their
passage
it
was
indeed
that
had
caused
the
breaking
in
this
cryptic
condensed
fashion
the
great
fact
came
over
him
that
he
and
these
other
two
here
and
now
took
part
in
some
great
ceremony
of
whose
ultimate
object
as
yet
he
was
in
ignorance
the
impact
with
which
it
dropped
upon
his
mind
was
tremendous
he
realised
it
most
fully
when
he
stepped
from
the
darkness
of
the
forest
and
entered
the
expanse
of
glimmering
early
light
up
till
this
moment
his
mind
was
being
prepared
only
whereas
now
he
knew
the
innate
desire
to
worship
which
all
along
had
been
his
the
momentum
his
religious
temperament
had
acquired
during
forty
years
the
yearning
to
have
proof
in
a
word
that
the
gods
he
once
acknowledged
were
really
true
swept
back
upon
him
with
that
violent
reaction
which
denial
had
aroused
he
wavered
where
he
stood
looking
about
him
then
while
the
others
rearranged
burdens
the
returning
porter
now
discarded
he
perceived
the
astonishing
beauty
of
the
time
and
place
feeling
it
soak
into
him
as
by
the
very
pores
of
his
skin
from
all
sides
this
beauty
rushed
upon
him
some
radiant
wingéd
sense
of
wonder
sped
past
him
through
the
silent
air
a
thrill
of
ecstasy
ran
down
every
nerve
the
hair
of
his
head
stood
up
it
was
far
from
unfamiliar
to
him
this
sight
of
the
upper
mountain
world
awakening
from
its
sleep
of
the
summer
night
but
never
before
had
he
stood
shuddering
thus
at
its
exquisite
cold
glory
nor
felt
its
significance
as
now
so
mysteriously
some
transcendent
power
that
held
sublimity
was
passing
across
this
huge
desolate
plateau
far
more
majestic
than
the
mere
sunrise
among
mountains
he
had
so
often
witnessed
there
was
movement
he
understood
why
he
had
seen
his
companions
insignificant
again
he
shivered
and
looked
about
him
touched
by
a
solemnity
that
held
deep
awe
personal
life
indeed
was
wrecked
destroyed
but
something
greater
was
on
the
way
his
fragile
alliance
with
a
spiritual
world
was
strengthened
he
realised
his
own
past
insolence
he
became
afraid
iii
the
treeless
plateau
littered
with
enormous
boulders
stretched
for
miles
to
right
and
left
grey
in
the
dusk
of
very
early
morning
behind
him
dropped
thick
guardian
into
the
sleeping
valley
that
still
detained
the
darkness
of
the
night
here
and
there
lay
patches
of
deep
snow
gleaming
faintly
through
thin
rising
mist
singing
streams
of
icy
water
spread
everywhere
among
the
stones
soaking
the
coarse
rough
grass
that
was
the
only
sign
of
vegetation
no
life
was
visible
nothing
stirred
nor
anywhere
was
movement
but
of
the
quiet
trailing
mist
and
of
his
own
breath
that
drifted
past
his
face
like
smoke
yet
through
the
splendid
stillness
there
movement
that
sense
of
absolute
movement
which
results
in
stillness
it
was
owing
to
the
stillness
that
he
became
aware
of
it
so
vast
indeed
that
only
immobility
could
express
it
thus
on
the
calmest
day
in
summer
may
the
headlong
rushing
of
the
earth
through
space
seem
more
real
than
when
the
tempest
shakes
the
trees
and
water
on
its
surface
or
great
machinery
turn
with
such
vertiginous
velocity
that
it
appears
steady
to
the
deceived
function
of
the
eye
for
it
was
not
through
the
eye
that
this
solemn
movement
made
itself
known
but
rather
through
a
massive
sensation
that
owned
his
entire
body
as
its
organ
within
the
amphitheatre
of
enormous
peaks
and
precipices
that
enclosed
the
plateau
piling
themselves
upon
the
horizon
limasson
felt
the
outline
of
a
ceremony
extended
the
pulses
of
its
grandeur
poured
into
him
where
he
stood
its
vast
design
was
knowable
because
they
themselves
had
traced
were
even
then
tracing
its
earthly
counterpart
in
little
and
the
awe
in
him
increased
this
light
is
false
we
have
an
hour
yet
before
the
true
dawn
he
heard
the
younger
man
say
lightly
the
summits
still
are
ghostly
let
us
enjoy
the
sensation
and
see
what
we
can
make
of
and
limasson
looking
up
startled
from
his
reverie
saw
that
the
heights
and
towers
indeed
were
heavy
with
shadow
faint
still
with
the
light
of
stars
it
seemed
to
him
they
bowed
their
awful
heads
and
that
their
stupendous
shoulders
lowered
they
drew
together
shutting
out
the
world
true
said
his
companion
and
the
upper
snows
still
wear
the
spectral
shine
of
night
but
let
us
now
move
faster
for
we
travel
very
light
the
sensations
you
propose
will
but
delay
and
weaken
he
handed
a
share
of
the
burdens
to
his
companion
and
to
limasson
slowly
they
all
moved
forward
and
the
mountains
shut
them
in
and
two
things
limasson
noted
then
as
he
shouldered
his
heavier
pack
and
led
the
way
first
that
he
suddenly
knew
their
destination
though
its
purpose
still
lay
hidden
and
secondly
that
the
porter
s
leaving
before
the
ascent
proper
began
signified
finally
that
ordinary
climbing
was
not
their
real
objective
also
the
dawn
was
a
lifting
of
inner
veils
from
off
his
mind
rather
than
a
brightening
of
the
visible
earth
due
to
the
nearing
sun
thick
darkness
indeed
draped
this
enormous
lonely
amphitheatre
where
they
moved
you
lead
us
well
said
the
priest
a
few
feet
behind
him
as
he
picked
his
way
unfalteringly
among
the
boulders
and
the
streams
strange
that
i
do
so
replied
limasson
in
a
low
tone
for
the
way
is
new
to
me
and
the
darkness
grows
instead
of
the
language
seemed
hardly
of
his
choosing
he
spoke
and
walked
as
in
a
dream
far
in
the
rear
the
voice
of
the
younger
man
called
plaintively
after
them
you
go
so
fast
i
can
t
keep
up
with
you
and
again
he
stumbled
and
dropped
his
among
the
rocks
he
seemed
for
ever
stooping
to
drink
the
icy
water
or
clambering
off
the
trail
to
test
the
patches
of
snow
as
to
quality
and
depth
you
re
missing
all
the
excitement
he
cried
repeatedly
there
are
a
hundred
pleasures
and
sensations
by
the
they
paused
a
moment
for
him
to
overtake
them
he
came
up
panting
and
exhausted
making
remarks
about
the
fading
stars
the
wind
upon
the
heights
new
routes
he
longed
to
try
up
dangerous
couloirs
about
everything
it
seemed
except
the
work
in
hand
there
was
eagerness
in
him
the
kind
of
excitement
that
saps
energy
and
wastes
the
nervous
force
threatening
a
probable
collapse
before
the
arduous
object
is
attained
keep
to
the
thing
in
hand
replied
the
priest
sternly
we
are
not
really
going
fast
it
is
you
who
are
scattering
yourself
to
no
purpose
it
wears
us
all
we
must
husband
our
resources
and
he
pointed
significantly
to
the
pyramid
of
the
tour
du
néant
that
gleamed
above
them
at
an
incredible
altitude
we
are
here
to
amuse
ourselves
life
is
a
pleasure
a
sensation
or
it
is
nothing
grumbled
his
companion
but
there
was
a
gravity
in
the
tone
of
the
older
man
that
discouraged
argument
and
made
resistance
difficult
the
other
arranged
his
pack
for
the
tenth
time
twisting
his
axe
through
an
ingenious
scheme
of
straps
and
string
and
fell
silently
into
line
behind
his
leaders
limasson
moved
on
again
and
the
darkness
at
length
began
to
lift
far
overhead
at
first
the
snowy
summits
shone
with
a
hue
less
spectral
a
delicate
pink
spread
softly
from
the
east
there
was
a
freshening
of
the
chilly
wind
then
suddenly
the
highest
peak
that
topped
the
others
by
a
thousand
feet
of
soaring
rock
stepped
sharply
into
sight
half
golden
and
half
rose
at
the
same
instant
the
vast
movement
of
the
entire
scene
slowed
down
there
came
one
or
two
terrific
gusts
of
wind
in
quick
succession
a
roar
like
an
avalanche
of
falling
stones
boomed
distantly
and
limasson
stopped
dead
and
held
his
breath
for
something
blocked
the
way
before
him
something
he
knew
he
could
not
pass
gigantic
and
unformed
it
seemed
part
of
the
architecture
of
the
desolate
waste
about
him
while
yet
it
bulked
there
enormous
in
the
trembling
dawn
as
belonging
neither
to
plain
nor
mountain
suddenly
it
was
there
where
a
moment
before
had
been
mere
emptiness
of
air
its
massive
outline
shifted
into
visibility
as
though
it
had
risen
from
the
ground
he
stood
stock
still
a
cold
that
was
not
of
this
world
turned
him
rigid
in
his
tracks
a
few
yards
behind
him
the
priest
had
halted
too
farther
in
the
rear
they
heard
the
stumbling
tread
of
the
younger
man
and
the
faint
calling
of
his
voice
a
feeble
broken
sound
as
of
a
man
whom
sudden
fear
distressed
to
helplessness
we
re
off
the
track
and
i
ve
lost
my
way
the
words
came
on
the
still
air
my
axe
is
gone
let
us
put
on
the
rope
hark
do
you
hear
that
roar
and
then
a
sound
as
though
he
came
slowly
groping
on
his
hands
and
knees
you
have
exhausted
yourself
too
soon
the
priest
answered
sternly
stay
where
you
are
and
rest
for
we
go
no
farther
this
is
the
place
we
there
was
in
his
tone
a
kind
of
ultimate
solemnity
that
for
a
moment
turned
limasson
s
attention
from
the
great
obstacle
that
blocked
his
farther
way
the
darkness
lifted
veil
by
veil
not
gradually
but
by
a
series
of
leaps
as
when
some
one
inexpertly
turns
a
wick
he
perceived
then
that
not
a
single
grandeur
loomed
in
front
but
that
others
of
similar
kind
some
huger
than
the
first
stood
all
about
him
forming
an
enclosing
circle
that
hemmed
him
in
then
with
a
start
he
recovered
himself
equilibrium
and
common
sense
returned
the
trick
that
sight
had
played
upon
him
assisted
by
the
rarefied
atmosphere
of
the
heights
and
by
the
witchery
of
dawn
was
no
uncommon
one
after
all
the
long
straining
of
the
eyes
to
pick
the
way
in
an
uncertain
light
so
easily
deceives
perspective
delusion
ever
follows
abrupt
change
of
focus
these
shadowy
encircling
forms
were
but
the
rampart
of
still
distant
precipices
whose
giant
walls
framed
the
tremendous
amphitheatre
to
the
sky
their
closeness
was
a
mere
gesture
of
the
dusk
and
distance
the
shock
of
the
discovery
produced
an
instant
s
unsteadiness
in
him
that
brought
bewilderment
he
straightened
up
raised
his
head
and
looked
about
him
the
cliffs
it
seemed
to
him
shifted
back
instantly
to
their
accustomed
places
as
though
after
all
they
been
close
there
was
a
reeling
among
the
topmost
crags
they
balanced
fearfully
then
stood
still
against
a
sky
already
faintly
crimson
the
roar
he
heard
that
might
well
have
seemed
the
tumult
of
their
hurrying
speed
was
in
reality
but
the
wind
of
dawn
that
rushed
against
their
ribs
beating
the
echoes
out
with
angry
wings
and
the
lines
of
trailing
mist
streaking
the
air
like
proofs
of
rapid
motion
merely
coiled
and
floated
in
the
empty
spaces
he
turned
to
the
priest
who
had
moved
up
beside
him
how
strange
he
said
is
this
beginning
of
new
light
my
sight
went
all
astray
for
a
passing
moment
i
thought
the
mountains
stood
right
across
my
path
and
when
i
looked
up
just
now
it
seemed
they
all
ran
his
voice
was
small
and
lost
in
the
great
listening
air
the
man
looked
fixedly
at
him
he
had
removed
his
slouch
hat
hot
with
the
long
ascent
and
as
he
answered
a
long
thin
shadow
flitted
across
his
features
a
breadth
of
darkness
dropped
about
them
it
was
as
though
a
mask
were
forming
the
face
that
now
was
covered
had
been
naked
he
was
so
long
in
answering
that
limasson
heard
his
mind
sharpening
the
sentence
like
a
pencil
he
spoke
very
slowly
move
perhaps
even
as
their
powers
move
and
their
minutes
are
our
years
their
passage
ever
is
in
tumult
there
is
disorder
then
among
the
affairs
of
men
there
is
confusion
in
their
minds
there
may
be
ruin
and
disaster
but
out
of
the
wreckage
shall
issue
strong
fresh
growth
for
like
a
sea
they
there
was
in
his
mien
a
grandeur
that
seemed
borrowed
marvellously
from
the
mountains
his
voice
was
grave
and
deep
he
made
no
sign
or
gesture
and
in
his
manner
was
a
curious
steadiness
that
breathed
through
the
language
a
kind
of
sacred
prophecy
long
thundering
gusts
of
wind
passed
distantly
across
the
precipices
as
he
spoke
the
same
moment
expecting
apparently
no
rejoinder
to
his
strange
utterance
he
stooped
and
began
to
unpack
his
knapsack
the
change
from
the
sacerdotal
language
to
this
commonplace
and
practical
detail
was
singularly
bewildering
it
is
the
time
to
rest
he
added
and
the
time
to
eat
let
us
and
he
drew
out
several
small
packets
and
laid
them
in
a
row
upon
the
ground
awe
deepened
over
limasson
as
he
watched
and
with
it
a
great
wonder
too
for
the
words
seemed
ominous
as
though
this
man
upon
the
floor
of
some
vast
temple
said
let
us
prepare
a
sacrifice
there
flashed
into
him
out
of
depths
that
had
hitherto
concealed
it
a
lightning
clue
that
hinted
at
explanation
of
the
entire
strange
proceeding
of
the
abrupt
meeting
with
the
strangers
the
impulsive
acceptance
of
their
project
for
the
great
ascent
their
grave
behaviour
as
though
it
were
a
ceremonial
of
immense
design
his
change
of
position
the
bewildering
tricks
of
sight
and
the
solemn
language
finally
of
the
older
man
that
corroborated
what
he
himself
had
deemed
at
first
illusion
in
a
flying
second
of
time
this
all
swept
through
him
and
with
it
the
sharp
desire
to
turn
aside
retreat
to
run
away
noting
the
movement
or
perhaps
divining
the
emotion
prompting
it
the
priest
looked
up
quickly
in
his
tone
was
a
coldness
that
seemed
as
though
this
scene
of
wintry
desolation
uttered
words
you
have
come
too
far
to
think
of
turning
back
it
is
not
possible
you
stand
now
at
the
gates
of
birth
and
death
all
that
might
hinder
you
have
so
bravely
cast
aside
be
brave
now
to
the
and
as
limasson
heard
the
words
there
dropped
suddenly
into
him
a
new
and
awful
insight
into
humanity
a
power
that
unerringly
discovered
the
spiritual
necessities
of
others
and
therefore
of
himself
with
a
shock
he
realised
that
the
younger
man
who
had
accompanied
them
with
increasing
difficulty
as
they
climbed
higher
and
higher
was
but
a
shadow
of
reality
like
the
porter
he
was
but
an
encumbrance
who
impeded
progress
and
he
turned
his
eyes
to
search
the
desolate
landscape
you
will
not
find
him
said
his
companion
for
he
is
gone
never
unless
you
weakly
call
shall
you
see
him
again
nor
desire
to
hear
his
and
limasson
realised
that
in
his
heart
he
had
all
the
while
disapproved
of
the
man
disliked
him
for
his
theatrical
fondness
of
sensation
and
effect
more
that
he
had
even
hated
and
despised
him
starvation
might
crawl
upon
him
where
he
had
fallen
and
eat
his
life
away
before
he
would
stir
a
finger
to
save
him
it
was
with
the
older
man
he
now
had
dreadful
business
in
hand
i
am
glad
he
answered
for
in
the
end
he
must
have
proved
my
death
our
death
and
they
drew
closer
round
the
little
circle
of
food
the
priest
had
laid
upon
the
rocky
ground
an
intimate
understanding
linking
them
together
in
a
sympathy
that
completed
limasson
s
bewilderment
there
was
bread
he
saw
and
there
was
salt
there
was
also
a
little
flask
of
deep
red
wine
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
was
a
miniature
fire
of
sticks
the
priest
had
collected
from
the
bushes
of
wild
rhododendron
the
smoke
rose
upwards
in
a
thin
blue
line
it
did
not
even
quiver
so
profound
was
the
surrounding
stillness
of
the
mountain
air
but
far
away
among
the
precipices
ran
the
boom
of
falling
water
and
behind
it
again
the
muffled
roar
as
of
peaks
and
that
swept
with
a
rolling
thunder
through
the
heavens
they
are
passing
the
priest
said
in
a
low
voice
and
they
know
that
you
are
here
you
have
now
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
for
if
you
yield
acceptance
of
your
own
free
will
success
is
sure
you
stand
before
the
gates
of
birth
and
death
they
offer
you
yet
i
denied
them
he
murmured
it
below
his
breath
denial
is
evocation
you
called
to
them
and
they
have
come
the
sacrifice
of
your
little
personal
life
is
all
they
ask
be
brave
and
yield
he
took
the
bread
as
he
spoke
and
breaking
it
in
three
pieces
he
placed
one
before
limasson
one
before
himself
and
the
third
he
laid
upon
the
flame
which
first
blackened
and
then
consumed
it
eat
it
and
understand
he
said
for
it
is
the
nourishment
that
shall
revive
your
fading
next
with
the
salt
he
did
the
same
then
raising
the
flask
of
wine
he
put
it
to
his
lips
offering
it
afterwards
to
his
companion
when
both
had
drunk
there
still
remained
the
greater
part
of
the
contents
he
lifted
the
vessel
with
both
hands
reverently
towards
the
sky
he
stood
upright
the
blood
of
your
personal
life
i
offer
to
them
in
your
name
by
the
renunciation
which
seems
to
you
as
death
shall
you
pass
through
the
gates
of
birth
to
the
life
of
freedom
beyond
for
the
ultimate
sacrifice
that
they
ask
of
you
is
and
bending
low
before
the
distant
heights
he
poured
the
wine
upon
the
rocky
ground
for
a
period
of
time
limasson
found
no
means
of
measuring
so
terrible
were
the
emotions
in
his
heart
the
priest
remained
in
this
attitude
of
worship
and
obeisance
the
tumult
in
the
mountains
ceased
an
absolute
hush
dropped
down
upon
the
world
there
seemed
a
pause
in
the
inner
history
of
the
universe
itself
all
waited
till
he
rose
again
and
when
he
did
so
the
mask
that
had
for
hours
now
been
spreading
across
his
features
was
accomplished
the
eyes
gazed
sternly
down
into
his
own
limasson
looked
and
recognised
he
stood
face
to
face
with
the
man
whom
he
knew
best
of
all
others
in
the
world
himself
there
had
been
death
there
had
also
been
that
recovery
of
splendour
which
is
birth
and
resurrection
and
the
sun
that
moment
with
the
sudden
surprise
that
mountains
only
know
rushed
clear
above
the
heights
bathing
the
landscape
and
the
standing
figure
with
a
stainless
glory
into
the
vast
temple
where
he
knelt
as
into
that
greater
inner
temple
which
is
mankind
s
true
house
of
royalty
there
poured
the
completing
presence
which
is
light
for
in
this
way
and
in
this
way
only
shall
you
pass
from
death
to
life
sang
a
chanting
voice
he
recognised
also
now
for
the
first
time
as
indubitably
his
own
it
was
marvellous
but
the
birth
of
light
is
ever
marvellous
it
was
anguish
but
the
pangs
of
resurrection
since
time
began
have
been
accomplished
by
the
sweetness
of
fierce
pain
for
the
majority
still
lie
in
the
stage
unborn
unconscious
of
a
definite
spiritual
existence
in
the
womb
they
grope
and
stifle
depending
ever
upon
another
denial
is
ever
the
call
to
life
a
protest
against
continued
darkness
for
deliverance
yet
birth
is
the
ruin
of
all
that
has
hitherto
been
depended
on
there
comes
then
that
standing
alone
which
at
first
seems
desolate
isolation
the
tumult
of
destruction
precedes
release
limasson
rose
to
his
feet
stood
with
difficulty
upright
looked
about
him
from
the
figure
so
close
now
at
his
side
to
the
snowy
summit
of
that
tour
du
néant
he
would
never
climb
the
roar
and
thunder
of
passage
was
resumed
it
seemed
the
mountains
reeled
they
are
passing
sang
the
voice
that
was
beside
him
and
within
him
too
but
they
have
known
you
and
your
offering
is
accepted
when
they
come
close
upon
the
world
there
is
ever
wreckage
and
disaster
in
the
affairs
of
men
they
bring
disorder
and
confusion
into
the
mind
a
confusion
that
seems
final
a
disorder
that
seems
to
threaten
death
for
there
is
tumult
in
their
presence
and
apparent
chaos
that
seems
the
abandonment
of
order
out
of
this
vast
ruin
then
there
issues
life
in
new
design
the
dislocation
is
its
entrance
the
dishevelment
its
strength
there
has
been
birth
the
sunlight
dazzled
his
eyes
that
distant
roar
like
a
wind
came
close
and
swept
his
face
an
icy
air
as
from
a
passing
star
breathed
over
him
are
you
prepared
he
heard
he
knelt
again
without
a
sign
of
hesitation
or
reluctance
he
bared
his
chest
to
the
sun
and
wind
the
flash
came
swiftly
instantly
descending
into
his
heart
with
unerring
aim
he
saw
the
gleam
in
the
air
he
felt
the
fiery
impact
of
the
blow
he
even
saw
the
stream
gush
forth
and
sink
into
the
rocky
ground
far
redder
than
the
wine
he
gasped
for
breath
a
moment
staggered
reeled
collapsed
and
within
the
moment
so
quickly
did
all
happen
he
was
aware
of
hands
that
supported
him
and
helped
him
to
his
feet
but
he
was
too
weak
to
stand
they
carried
him
up
to
bed
the
porter
and
the
man
who
had
reached
across
him
for
the
matches
five
minutes
before
intending
conversation
stood
one
at
his
feet
and
the
other
at
his
head
as
he
passed
through
the
vestibule
of
the
hotel
he
saw
the
people
staring
and
in
his
hand
he
crumpled
up
the
unopened
letters
he
had
received
so
short
a
time
ago
i
really
think
i
can
manage
alone
he
thanked
them
if
you
will
set
me
down
i
can
walk
i
felt
dizzy
for
a
the
heat
in
the
hall
the
gentleman
began
in
a
quiet
sympathetic
voice
they
left
him
standing
on
the
stairs
watching
a
moment
to
see
that
he
had
quite
recovered
limasson
walked
up
the
two
flights
to
his
room
without
faltering
the
momentary
dizziness
had
passed
he
felt
quite
himself
again
strong
confident
able
to
stand
alone
able
to
move
forward
able
to
the
damned
i
i
m
over
forty
frances
and
rather
set
in
my
ways
i
said
ready
to
yield
if
she
insisted
that
our
going
together
on
the
visit
involved
her
happiness
my
work
is
rather
heavy
just
now
too
as
you
know
the
question
is
i
work
there
with
a
lot
of
unassorted
people
in
the
house
mabel
doesn
t
mention
any
other
people
bill
was
my
sister
s
rejoinder
i
gather
she
s
alone
as
well
as
by
the
way
she
looked
sideways
out
of
the
window
at
nothing
it
was
obvious
she
was
disappointed
but
to
my
surprise
she
did
not
urge
the
point
and
as
i
glanced
at
franklyn
s
invitation
lying
upon
her
sloping
lap
the
neat
childish
handwriting
conjured
up
a
mental
picture
of
the
banker
s
widow
with
her
timid
insignificant
personality
her
pale
grey
eyes
and
her
expression
as
of
a
backward
child
i
thought
too
of
the
roomy
country
mansion
her
late
husband
had
altered
to
suit
his
particular
needs
and
of
my
visit
to
it
a
few
years
ago
when
its
barren
spaciousness
suggested
a
wing
of
kensington
museum
fitted
up
temporarily
as
a
place
to
eat
and
sleep
in
comparing
it
mentally
with
the
poky
chelsea
flat
where
i
and
my
sister
kept
impecunious
house
i
realised
other
points
as
well
unworthy
details
flashed
across
me
to
entice
the
fine
library
the
organ
the
quiet
i
should
have
perfect
service
the
delicious
cup
of
early
tea
and
hot
baths
at
any
moment
of
the
day
without
a
geyser
it
s
a
longish
visit
a
month
isn
t
it
i
hedged
smiling
at
the
details
that
seduced
me
and
ashamed
of
my
man
s
selfishness
yet
knowing
that
frances
expected
it
of
me
there
points
about
it
i
admit
if
you
re
set
on
my
going
with
you
i
could
manage
it
all
i
spoke
at
length
in
this
way
because
my
sister
made
no
answer
i
saw
her
tired
eyes
gazing
into
the
dreariness
of
oakley
street
and
felt
a
pang
strike
through
me
after
a
pause
in
which
again
she
said
no
word
i
added
so
when
you
write
the
letter
you
might
hint
perhaps
that
i
usually
work
all
the
morning
and
er
am
not
a
very
lively
visitor
then
she
ll
understand
you
and
i
to
return
to
my
diminutive
study
where
i
was
slaving
just
then
at
an
absorbing
article
on
comparative
æsthetic
values
in
the
blind
and
deaf
but
frances
did
not
move
she
kept
her
grey
eyes
upon
oakley
street
where
the
evening
mist
from
the
river
drew
mournful
perspectives
into
view
it
was
late
october
we
heard
the
omnibuses
thundering
across
the
bridge
the
monotony
of
that
broad
characterless
street
seemed
more
than
usually
depressing
even
in
june
sunshine
it
was
dead
but
with
autumn
its
melancholy
soaked
into
every
house
between
king
s
road
and
the
embankment
it
washed
thought
into
the
past
instead
of
inviting
it
hopefully
towards
the
future
for
me
its
easy
width
was
an
avenue
through
which
nameless
slums
across
the
river
sent
creeping
messages
of
depression
and
i
always
regarded
it
as
winter
s
main
entrance
into
london
fog
slush
gloom
trooped
down
it
every
november
waving
their
forbidding
banners
till
march
came
to
rout
them
its
one
claim
upon
my
love
was
that
the
south
wind
swept
sometimes
unobstructed
up
it
soft
with
suggestions
of
the
sea
these
lugubrious
thoughts
i
naturally
kept
to
myself
though
i
never
ceased
to
regret
the
little
flat
whose
cheapness
had
seduced
us
now
as
i
watched
my
sister
s
impassive
face
i
realised
that
perhaps
she
too
felt
as
i
felt
yet
brave
woman
without
betraying
it
and
look
here
fanny
i
said
putting
a
hand
upon
her
shoulder
as
i
crossed
the
room
it
would
be
the
very
thing
for
you
you
re
worn
out
with
catering
and
housekeeping
mabel
is
your
oldest
friend
besides
and
you
ve
hardly
seen
her
since
died
she
s
been
abroad
for
a
year
bill
and
only
just
came
back
my
sister
interposed
she
came
back
rather
unexpectedly
though
i
never
thought
she
would
go
to
live
she
stopped
abruptly
clearly
she
was
only
speaking
half
her
mind
probably
she
went
on
mabel
wants
to
pick
up
old
links
naturally
i
put
in
yourself
chief
among
the
veiled
reference
to
the
house
i
let
pass
it
involved
discussing
the
dead
man
for
one
thing
i
feel
ought
to
go
anyhow
she
resumed
and
of
course
it
would
be
jollier
if
you
came
too
you
d
get
in
such
a
muddle
here
by
yourself
and
eat
wrong
things
and
forget
to
air
the
rooms
and
oh
everything
she
looked
up
laughing
only
she
added
there
s
the
british
museum
but
there
s
a
big
library
there
i
answered
and
all
the
books
of
reference
i
could
possibly
want
it
was
of
you
i
was
thinking
you
could
take
up
your
painting
again
you
always
sell
half
of
what
you
paint
it
would
be
a
splendid
rest
too
and
sussex
is
a
jolly
country
to
walk
in
by
all
means
fanny
i
advise
our
eyes
met
as
i
stammered
in
my
attempts
to
avoid
expressing
the
thought
that
hid
in
both
our
minds
my
sister
had
a
weakness
for
dabbling
in
the
various
new
theories
of
the
day
and
mabel
who
before
her
marriage
had
belonged
to
foolish
societies
for
investigating
the
future
life
to
the
neglect
of
the
present
one
had
fostered
this
undesirable
tendency
her
amiable
impressionable
temperament
was
open
to
every
psychic
wind
that
blew
i
deplored
detested
the
whole
business
but
even
more
than
this
i
abhorred
the
later
influence
that
franklyn
had
steeped
his
wife
in
capturing
her
body
and
soul
in
his
sombre
doctrines
i
had
dreaded
lest
my
sister
also
might
be
caught
now
that
she
is
alone
again
i
stopped
short
our
eyes
now
made
pretence
impossible
for
the
truth
had
slipped
out
inevitably
stupidly
although
unexpressed
in
definite
language
we
laughed
turning
our
faces
a
moment
to
look
at
other
things
in
the
room
frances
picked
up
a
book
and
examined
its
cover
as
though
she
had
made
an
important
discovery
while
i
took
my
case
out
and
lit
a
cigarette
i
did
not
want
to
smoke
we
left
the
matter
there
i
went
out
of
the
room
before
further
explanation
could
cause
tension
disagreements
grow
into
discord
from
such
tiny
things
wrong
adjectives
or
a
chance
inflection
of
the
voice
frances
had
a
right
to
her
views
of
life
as
much
as
i
had
at
least
i
reflected
comfortably
we
had
separated
upon
an
agreement
this
time
recognised
mutually
though
not
actually
stated
and
this
point
of
meeting
was
oddly
enough
our
way
of
regarding
some
one
who
was
dead
for
we
had
both
disliked
the
husband
with
a
great
dislike
and
during
his
three
years
married
life
had
only
been
to
the
house
once
for
a
visit
arriving
late
on
saturday
we
had
left
after
an
early
breakfast
on
monday
morning
ascribing
my
sister
s
dislike
to
a
natural
jealousy
at
losing
her
old
friend
i
said
merely
that
he
displeased
me
yet
we
both
knew
that
the
real
emotion
lay
much
deeper
frances
loyal
honourable
creature
had
kept
silence
and
beyond
saying
that
house
and
grounds
he
altered
one
and
laid
out
the
other
distressed
her
as
an
expression
of
his
personality
somehow
distressed
was
the
word
she
used
no
further
explanation
had
passed
her
lips
our
dislike
of
his
personality
was
easily
accounted
for
up
to
a
point
since
both
of
us
shared
the
artist
s
point
of
view
that
a
creed
cut
to
measure
and
carefully
dried
was
an
ugly
thing
and
that
a
dogma
to
which
believers
must
subscribe
or
perish
everlastingly
was
a
barbarism
resting
upon
cruelty
but
while
my
own
dislike
was
purely
due
to
an
abstract
worship
of
beauty
my
sister
s
had
another
twist
in
it
for
with
her
new
tendencies
she
believed
that
all
religions
were
an
aspect
of
truth
and
that
no
one
even
the
lowest
wretch
could
escape
heaven
in
the
long
run
samuel
franklyn
the
rich
banker
was
a
man
universally
respected
and
admired
and
the
marriage
though
mabel
was
fifteen
years
his
junior
won
general
applause
his
bride
was
an
heiress
in
her
own
right
breweries
and
the
story
of
her
conversion
at
a
revivalist
meeting
where
samuel
franklyn
had
spoken
fervidly
of
heaven
and
terrifyingly
of
sin
hell
and
damnation
even
contained
a
touch
of
genuine
romance
she
was
a
brand
snatched
from
the
burning
his
detailed
eloquence
had
frightened
her
into
heaven
salvation
came
in
the
nick
of
time
his
words
had
plucked
her
from
the
edge
of
that
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
where
their
worm
dieth
not
and
the
fire
is
not
quenched
she
regarded
him
as
a
hero
sighed
her
relief
upon
his
saintly
shoulder
and
accepted
the
peace
he
offered
her
with
a
grateful
resignation
for
her
husband
was
a
religious
man
who
successfully
combined
great
riches
with
the
glamour
of
winning
souls
he
was
a
portly
figure
though
tall
with
masterful
big
hands
the
fingers
rather
thick
and
red
and
his
dignity
that
just
escaped
being
pompous
held
in
it
something
that
was
implacable
a
convinced
assurance
almost
remorseless
gleamed
in
his
eyes
when
he
preached
especially
and
his
threats
of
hell
fire
must
have
scared
souls
stronger
than
the
timid
receptive
mabel
whom
he
married
he
clad
himself
in
long
that
buttoned
unevenly
big
square
boots
and
trousers
that
invariably
bagged
at
the
knee
and
were
a
little
short
he
wore
low
collars
spats
occasionally
and
a
tall
black
hat
that
was
not
of
silk
his
voice
was
alternately
hard
and
unctuous
and
he
regarded
theatres
and
as
the
vestibule
of
that
brimstone
lake
of
whose
geography
he
was
as
positive
as
of
his
great
banking
offices
in
the
city
a
philanthropist
up
to
the
hilt
however
no
one
ever
doubted
his
complete
sincerity
his
convictions
were
ingrained
his
faith
borne
out
by
his
life
as
witness
his
name
upon
so
many
admirable
societies
as
treasurer
patron
or
heading
the
donation
list
he
bulked
large
in
the
world
of
doing
good
a
broad
and
stately
stone
in
the
rampart
against
evil
and
his
heart
was
genuinely
kind
and
soft
for
others
who
believed
as
he
did
yet
in
spite
of
this
true
sympathy
with
suffering
and
his
desire
to
help
he
was
narrow
as
a
telegraph
wire
and
unbending
as
a
church
pillar
he
was
intensely
selfish
intolerant
as
an
officer
of
the
inquisition
his
bourgeois
soul
constructed
a
revolting
scheme
of
heaven
that
was
reproduced
in
miniature
in
all
he
did
and
planned
faith
was
the
qua
of
salvation
and
by
faith
he
meant
belief
in
his
own
particular
view
of
things
which
faith
except
every
one
do
keep
whole
and
undefiled
without
doubt
he
shall
perish
all
the
world
but
his
own
small
exclusive
sect
must
be
damned
eternally
a
pity
but
alas
inevitable
was
right
yet
he
prayed
without
ceasing
and
gave
heavily
to
the
poor
the
only
thing
he
could
not
give
being
big
ideas
to
his
provincial
and
suburban
deity
pettier
than
an
insect
and
more
obstinate
than
a
mule
he
had
also
the
superior
sleek
humility
of
a
chosen
he
was
churchwarden
too
he
read
the
lessons
in
a
place
of
worship
either
chilly
or
overheated
where
neither
organ
vestments
nor
lighted
candles
were
permitted
but
where
the
odour
of
on
the
boys
heads
in
the
back
rows
pervaded
the
entire
building
this
portrait
of
the
banker
who
accumulated
riches
both
on
earth
and
in
heaven
may
possibly
be
overdrawn
however
because
frances
and
i
were
artistic
temperaments
that
viewed
the
type
with
a
dislike
and
distrust
amounting
to
contempt
the
majority
considered
samuel
franklyn
a
worthy
man
and
a
good
citizen
the
majority
doubtless
held
the
saner
view
a
few
years
more
and
he
certainly
would
have
been
made
a
baronet
he
relieved
much
suffering
in
the
world
as
assuredly
as
he
caused
many
souls
the
agonies
of
torturing
fear
by
his
emphasis
upon
damnation
had
there
been
one
point
of
beauty
in
him
we
might
have
been
more
lenient
only
we
found
it
not
and
i
admit
took
little
pains
to
search
i
shall
never
forget
the
look
of
dour
forgiveness
with
which
he
heard
our
excuses
for
missing
morning
prayers
that
sunday
morning
of
our
single
visit
to
the
towers
my
sister
learned
that
a
change
was
made
soon
afterwards
prayers
being
conducted
after
breakfast
instead
of
before
the
towers
stood
solemnly
upon
a
sussex
hill
amid
modern
grounds
but
the
house
can
not
better
be
described
it
would
be
so
wearisome
for
one
thing
than
by
saying
that
it
was
a
cross
between
an
overgrown
pretentious
norwood
villa
and
one
of
those
saturnine
institutes
for
cripples
the
train
passes
as
it
slinks
ashamed
through
south
london
into
surrey
it
was
wealthily
furnished
and
at
first
sight
imposing
but
on
closer
acquaintance
revealed
a
meagre
personality
barren
and
austere
one
looked
for
rules
and
regulations
on
the
walls
all
signed
by
order
the
place
was
a
prison
that
shut
out
the
there
was
of
course
no
no
no
room
for
play
of
any
kind
and
the
great
hall
at
the
back
once
a
chapel
which
might
have
been
used
for
dancing
theatricals
or
other
innocent
amusements
was
consecrated
in
his
day
to
meetings
of
various
kinds
chiefly
brigades
temperance
or
missionary
societies
there
was
a
harmonium
at
one
end
on
the
level
floor
a
raised
dais
or
platform
at
the
other
and
a
gallery
above
for
the
servants
gardeners
and
coachmen
it
was
heated
with
pipes
and
hung
with
doré
s
pictures
though
these
latter
were
soon
removed
and
stored
out
of
sight
in
the
attics
as
being
too
unspiritual
in
polished
shiny
wood
it
was
a
representation
in
miniature
of
that
poky
exclusive
heaven
he
took
about
with
him
externalising
it
in
all
he
did
and
planned
even
in
the
grounds
about
the
house
changes
in
the
towers
frances
told
me
had
been
made
during
mabel
s
year
of
widowhood
abroad
an
organ
put
into
the
big
hall
the
library
made
liveable
and
recatalogued
when
it
was
permissible
to
suppose
she
had
found
her
soul
again
and
returned
to
her
normal
healthy
views
of
life
which
included
enjoyment
and
play
literature
music
and
the
arts
without
however
a
touch
of
that
trivial
thoughtlessness
usually
termed
worldliness
franklyn
as
i
remembered
her
was
a
quiet
little
woman
shallow
perhaps
and
easily
influenced
but
sincere
as
a
dog
and
thorough
in
her
faithful
friendships
her
tastes
at
heart
were
catholic
and
that
heart
was
simple
and
unimaginative
that
she
took
up
with
the
various
movements
of
the
day
was
sign
merely
that
she
was
searching
in
her
limited
way
for
a
belief
that
should
bring
her
peace
she
was
in
fact
a
very
ordinary
woman
her
calibre
a
little
less
than
that
of
frances
i
knew
they
used
to
discuss
all
kinds
of
theories
together
but
as
these
discussions
never
resulted
in
action
i
had
come
to
regard
her
as
harmless
still
i
was
not
sorry
when
she
married
and
i
did
not
welcome
now
a
renewal
of
the
former
intimacy
the
philanthropist
had
given
her
no
children
or
she
would
have
made
a
good
and
sensible
mother
no
doubt
she
would
marry
again
mabel
mentions
that
she
s
been
alone
at
the
towers
since
the
end
of
august
frances
told
me
at
and
i
m
sure
she
feels
out
of
it
and
lonely
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
go
besides
i
always
liked
i
agreed
i
had
recovered
from
my
attack
of
selfishness
i
expressed
my
pleasure
you
ve
written
to
accept
i
said
half
statement
and
half
question
frances
nodded
i
thanked
for
you
she
added
quietly
explaining
that
you
were
not
free
at
the
moment
but
that
later
if
not
inconvenient
you
might
come
down
for
a
bit
and
join
i
stared
frances
sometimes
had
this
independent
way
of
deciding
things
i
was
convicted
and
punished
into
the
bargain
of
course
there
followed
argument
and
explanation
as
between
brother
and
sister
who
were
affectionate
but
the
recording
of
our
talk
could
be
of
little
interest
it
was
arranged
thus
frances
and
i
both
satisfied
two
days
later
she
departed
for
the
towers
leaving
me
alone
in
the
flat
with
everything
planned
for
my
comfort
and
good
behaviour
she
was
rather
a
tyrant
in
her
quiet
way
and
her
last
words
as
i
saw
her
off
from
charing
cross
rang
in
my
head
for
a
long
time
after
she
was
gone
i
ll
write
and
let
you
know
bill
eat
properly
mind
and
let
me
know
if
anything
goes
she
waved
her
small
gloved
hand
nodded
her
head
till
the
feather
brushed
the
window
and
was
gone
ii
after
the
note
announcing
her
safe
arrival
a
week
of
silence
passed
and
then
a
letter
came
there
were
various
suggestions
for
my
welfare
and
the
rest
was
the
usual
rambling
information
and
description
frances
loved
generously
italicised
and
we
are
quite
alone
she
went
on
in
her
enormous
handwriting
that
seemed
such
a
waste
of
space
and
labour
though
some
others
are
coming
presently
i
believe
you
could
work
here
to
your
heart
s
content
mabel
understands
and
says
she
would
love
to
have
you
when
you
feel
free
to
come
she
has
changed
a
bit
back
to
her
old
natural
self
she
never
mentions
the
place
has
changed
too
in
certain
ways
it
has
more
cheerfulness
i
think
has
put
it
in
this
cheerfulness
spaded
it
in
if
you
know
what
i
mean
but
it
lies
about
uneasily
and
is
not
natural
quite
the
organ
is
a
beauty
she
must
be
very
rich
now
but
she
s
as
gentle
and
sweet
as
ever
do
you
know
bill
i
think
he
must
have
her
into
marrying
him
i
get
the
impression
she
was
afraid
of
this
last
sentence
was
inked
out
but
i
read
it
through
the
scratching
the
letters
being
too
big
to
hide
he
had
an
inflexible
will
beneath
all
that
oily
kindness
which
passed
for
spiritual
he
was
a
real
personality
i
mean
i
m
sure
he
d
have
sent
you
and
me
cheerfully
to
the
stake
in
another
century
our
own
isn
t
it
odd
she
never
speaks
of
him
even
to
me
this
again
was
stroked
through
though
without
the
intention
to
obliterate
merely
because
it
was
repetition
probably
the
only
reminder
of
him
in
the
house
now
is
a
big
copy
of
the
presentation
portrait
that
stands
on
the
stairs
of
the
multitechnic
institute
at
peckham
you
know
that
one
with
his
fat
hand
sprinkled
with
rings
resting
on
a
thick
bible
and
the
other
slipped
between
the
buttons
of
a
tight
it
hangs
in
the
and
rather
dominates
our
meals
i
wish
mabel
would
take
it
down
i
think
she
d
like
to
if
she
there
s
not
a
single
photograph
of
him
anywhere
even
in
her
own
room
marsh
is
here
you
remember
her
housekeeper
the
wife
of
the
man
who
got
penal
servitude
for
killing
a
baby
or
something
said
she
robbed
him
and
justified
her
stealing
because
the
story
of
the
unjust
steward
was
in
the
bible
how
we
laughed
over
that
just
the
same
too
gliding
about
all
over
the
house
and
turning
up
when
least
other
reminiscences
filled
the
next
two
sides
of
the
letter
and
ran
without
a
trace
of
punctuation
into
instructions
about
a
salamander
stove
for
heating
my
in
the
flat
these
were
followed
by
things
i
was
to
tell
the
cook
and
by
requests
for
several
articles
she
had
forgotten
and
would
like
sent
after
her
two
of
them
blouses
with
descriptions
so
lengthy
and
contradictory
that
i
sighed
as
i
read
them
unless
you
come
down
soon
in
which
case
perhaps
you
wouldn
t
mind
bringing
them
the
mauve
one
i
wear
in
the
evening
sometimes
but
the
pale
blue
one
with
lace
round
the
collar
and
the
crinkly
front
they
re
in
the
cupboard
or
the
drawer
i
m
not
sure
which
of
my
bedroom
if
you
re
in
doubt
thanks
most
send
a
telegram
remember
and
we
ll
meet
you
in
the
motor
i
don
t
quite
know
if
i
shall
stay
the
whole
month
it
all
depends
and
she
closed
the
letter
the
italicised
words
increasing
recklessly
towards
the
end
with
a
repetition
that
mabel
would
love
to
have
me
for
myself
as
also
to
have
a
man
in
the
house
and
that
i
only
had
to
telegraph
the
day
and
the
train
this
letter
coming
by
the
second
post
interrupted
me
in
a
moment
of
absorbing
work
and
having
read
it
through
to
make
sure
there
was
nothing
requiring
instant
attention
i
threw
it
aside
and
went
on
with
my
notes
and
reading
within
five
minutes
however
it
was
back
at
me
again
that
restless
thing
called
between
the
lines
fluttered
about
my
mind
my
interest
in
the
balkan
states
political
article
that
had
been
ordered
faded
somewhere
somehow
i
felt
disquieted
disturbed
at
first
i
persisted
in
my
work
forcing
myself
to
concentrate
but
soon
found
that
a
layer
of
new
impressions
floated
between
the
article
and
my
attention
it
was
like
a
shadow
though
a
shadow
that
dissolved
upon
inspection
once
or
twice
i
glanced
up
expecting
to
find
some
one
in
the
room
that
the
door
had
opened
unobserved
and
annie
was
waiting
for
instructions
i
heard
the
buses
thundering
across
the
bridge
i
was
aware
of
oakley
street
montenegro
and
the
blue
adriatic
melted
into
the
october
haze
along
that
depressing
embankment
that
aped
a
river
bank
and
sentences
from
the
letter
flashed
before
my
eyes
and
stung
me
picking
it
up
and
reading
it
through
more
carefully
i
rang
the
bell
and
told
annie
to
find
the
blouses
and
pack
them
for
the
post
showing
her
finally
the
written
description
and
resenting
the
superior
smile
with
which
she
at
once
interrupted
know
them
sir
and
disappeared
but
it
was
not
the
blouses
it
was
that
exasperating
thing
between
the
lines
that
put
an
end
to
my
work
with
its
elusive
teasing
nuisance
the
first
sharp
impression
is
alone
of
value
in
such
a
case
for
once
analysis
begins
the
imagination
constructs
all
kinds
of
false
interpretation
the
more
i
thought
the
more
i
grew
fuddled
the
letter
it
seemed
to
me
wanted
to
say
another
thing
instead
the
eight
sheets
it
merely
it
came
to
the
edge
of
disclosure
then
halted
there
was
something
on
the
writer
s
mind
and
i
felt
uneasy
studying
the
sentences
brought
however
no
revelation
but
increased
confusion
only
for
while
the
uneasiness
remained
the
first
clear
hint
had
vanished
in
the
end
i
closed
my
books
and
went
out
to
look
up
another
matter
at
the
british
museum
library
perhaps
i
should
discover
it
that
way
by
turning
the
mind
in
a
totally
new
direction
i
lunched
at
the
express
dairy
in
oxford
street
close
by
and
telephoned
to
annie
that
i
would
be
home
to
tea
at
five
and
at
tea
tired
physically
and
mentally
after
breathing
the
exhausted
air
of
the
rotunda
for
five
hours
my
mind
suddenly
delivered
up
its
original
impression
vivid
and
no
proof
accompanied
the
revelation
it
was
mere
presentiment
but
convincing
frances
was
disturbed
in
her
mind
her
orderly
sensible
housekeeping
mind
she
was
uneasy
even
perhaps
afraid
something
in
the
house
distressed
her
and
she
had
need
of
me
unless
i
went
down
her
time
of
rest
and
change
her
quite
necessary
holiday
in
fact
would
be
spoilt
she
was
too
unselfish
to
say
this
but
it
ran
everywhere
between
the
lines
i
saw
it
clearly
now
franklyn
moreover
and
that
meant
frances
too
would
like
a
man
in
the
it
was
a
disagreeable
phrase
a
suggestive
way
of
hinting
something
she
dared
not
state
definitely
the
two
women
in
that
great
lonely
barrack
of
a
house
were
afraid
my
sense
of
duty
affection
unselfishness
whatever
the
composite
emotion
may
be
termed
was
stirred
also
my
vanity
i
acted
quickly
lest
reflection
should
warp
clear
decent
judgment
annie
i
said
when
she
answered
the
bell
you
need
not
send
those
blouses
by
the
post
i
ll
take
them
down
when
i
go
i
shall
be
away
a
week
or
two
possibly
and
having
looked
up
a
train
i
hastened
out
to
telegraph
before
i
could
change
my
fickle
mind
but
no
desire
came
that
night
to
change
my
mind
i
was
doing
the
right
the
necessary
thing
i
was
even
in
something
of
a
hurry
to
get
down
to
the
towers
as
soon
as
possible
i
chose
an
early
afternoon
train
iii
a
telegram
had
told
me
to
come
to
a
town
ten
miles
from
the
house
so
i
was
saved
the
crawling
train
to
the
local
station
and
travelled
down
by
an
express
as
soon
as
we
left
london
the
fog
cleared
off
and
an
autumn
sun
though
without
heat
in
it
painted
the
landscape
with
golden
browns
and
yellows
my
spirits
rose
as
i
lay
back
in
the
luxurious
motor
and
sped
between
the
woods
and
hedges
oddly
enough
my
anxiety
of
overnight
had
disappeared
it
was
due
no
doubt
to
that
exaggeration
of
detail
which
reflection
in
loneliness
brings
frances
and
i
had
not
been
separated
for
over
a
year
and
her
letters
from
the
towers
told
so
little
it
had
seemed
unnatural
to
be
deprived
of
those
intimate
particulars
of
mood
and
feeling
i
was
accustomed
to
we
had
such
confidence
in
one
another
and
our
affection
was
so
deep
though
she
was
but
five
years
younger
than
myself
i
regarded
her
as
a
child
my
attitude
was
fatherly
in
return
she
certainly
mothered
me
with
a
solicitude
that
never
cloyed
i
felt
no
desire
to
marry
while
she
was
still
alive
she
painted
in
with
a
reasonable
success
and
kept
house
for
me
i
wrote
reviewed
books
and
lectured
on
æsthetics
we
were
a
humdrum
couple
of
well
satisfied
with
life
and
all
i
feared
for
her
was
that
she
might
become
a
suffragette
or
be
taken
captive
by
one
of
these
wild
theories
that
caught
her
imagination
sometimes
and
that
mabel
for
one
had
fostered
as
for
myself
no
doubt
she
deemed
me
a
trifle
solid
or
stolid
i
forget
which
word
she
preferred
but
on
the
whole
there
was
just
sufficient
difference
of
opinion
to
make
intercourse
suggestive
without
monotony
and
certainly
without
quarrelling
drawing
in
deep
draughts
of
the
stinging
autumn
air
i
felt
happy
and
exhilarated
it
was
like
going
for
a
holiday
with
comfort
at
the
end
of
the
journey
instead
of
bargaining
for
centimes
but
my
heart
sank
noticeably
the
moment
the
house
came
into
view
the
long
drive
lined
with
hostile
monkey
trees
and
formal
wellingtonias
that
were
solemn
and
sedate
was
mere
extension
of
the
miniature
approach
to
a
thousand
suburban
residences
and
the
appearance
of
the
towers
as
we
turned
the
corner
with
a
rush
suggested
a
commonplace
climax
to
a
story
that
had
begun
interestingly
almost
thrillingly
a
villa
had
escaped
from
the
shadow
of
the
crystal
palace
thumped
its
way
down
by
night
grown
suddenly
monstrous
in
a
shower
of
rich
rain
and
settled
itself
insolently
to
stay
ivy
climbed
about
the
opulent
walls
but
climbed
neatly
and
with
disfiguring
effect
sham
as
on
a
prison
or
the
simile
made
me
smile
an
orphan
asylum
there
was
no
hint
of
the
comely
roughness
of
untidy
ivy
on
a
ruin
clipped
trained
and
precise
it
was
as
on
a
protestant
church
i
swear
there
was
not
a
bird
s
nest
nor
a
single
earwig
in
it
anywhere
about
the
porch
it
was
particularly
thick
smothering
a
lamp
with
a
contrast
that
was
quite
horrible
extensive
spread
away
on
the
farther
side
of
the
house
the
numerous
towers
to
which
the
building
owed
its
name
seemed
made
to
hold
school
bells
and
the
thick
with
potted
flowers
made
me
think
of
the
desolate
suburbs
of
brighton
or
bexhill
in
a
commanding
position
upon
the
crest
of
a
hill
it
overlooked
miles
of
undulating
wooded
country
southwards
to
the
downs
but
behind
it
to
the
north
thick
banks
of
ilex
holly
and
privet
protected
it
from
the
cleaner
and
more
stimulating
winds
hence
though
highly
placed
it
was
shut
in
three
years
had
passed
since
i
last
set
eyes
upon
it
but
the
unsightly
memory
i
had
retained
was
justified
by
the
reality
the
place
was
deplorable
it
is
my
habit
to
express
my
opinions
audibly
sometimes
when
impressions
are
strong
enough
to
warrant
it
but
now
i
only
sighed
oh
dear
as
i
extricated
my
legs
from
many
rugs
and
went
into
the
house
a
tall
with
the
bearing
of
a
grenadier
received
me
and
standing
behind
her
was
marsh
the
housekeeper
whom
i
remembered
because
her
untidy
back
hair
had
suggested
to
me
that
it
had
been
burnt
i
went
at
once
to
my
room
my
hostess
already
dressing
for
dinner
but
frances
came
in
to
see
me
just
as
i
was
struggling
with
my
black
tie
that
had
got
tangled
like
a
bootlace
she
fastened
it
for
me
in
a
neat
effective
bow
and
while
i
held
my
chin
up
for
the
operation
staring
blankly
at
the
ceiling
the
impression
came
i
wondered
was
it
her
touch
that
caused
it
that
something
in
her
trembled
shrinking
perhaps
is
the
truer
word
nothing
in
her
face
or
manner
betrayed
it
nor
in
her
pleasant
easy
talk
while
she
tidied
my
things
and
scolded
my
slovenly
packing
as
her
habit
was
questioning
me
about
the
servants
at
the
flat
the
blouses
though
right
were
crumpled
and
my
scolding
was
deserved
there
was
no
impatience
even
yet
somehow
or
other
the
suggestion
of
a
shrinking
reserve
and
holding
back
reached
my
mind
she
had
been
lonely
of
course
but
it
was
more
than
that
she
was
glad
that
i
had
come
yet
for
some
reason
unstated
she
could
have
wished
that
i
had
stayed
away
we
discussed
the
news
that
had
accumulated
during
our
brief
separation
and
in
doing
so
the
impression
at
best
exceedingly
slight
was
forgotten
my
chamber
was
large
and
beautifully
furnished
the
hall
and
of
our
flat
would
have
gone
into
it
with
a
good
remainder
yet
it
was
not
a
place
i
could
settle
down
in
for
work
it
conveyed
the
idea
of
impermanence
making
me
feel
transient
as
in
a
hotel
bedroom
this
of
course
was
the
fact
but
some
rooms
convey
a
settled
lasting
hospitality
even
in
a
hotel
this
one
did
not
and
as
i
was
accustomed
to
work
in
the
room
i
slept
in
at
least
when
visiting
a
slight
frown
must
have
crept
between
my
eyes
mabel
has
fitted
a
for
you
just
out
of
the
library
said
the
clairvoyant
frances
no
one
will
disturb
you
there
and
you
ll
have
fifteen
thousand
books
all
catalogued
within
easy
reach
there
s
a
private
staircase
too
you
can
breakfast
in
your
room
and
slip
down
in
your
if
you
want
she
laughed
my
spirits
took
a
turn
upwards
as
absurdly
as
they
had
gone
down
and
how
are
i
asked
giving
her
a
belated
kiss
it
s
jolly
to
be
together
again
i
did
feel
rather
lost
without
you
i
ll
that
s
natural
she
laughed
i
m
so
she
looked
well
and
had
country
colour
in
her
cheeks
she
informed
me
that
she
was
eating
and
sleeping
well
going
out
for
little
walks
with
mabel
painting
bits
of
scenery
again
and
enjoying
a
complete
change
and
rest
and
yet
for
all
her
brave
description
the
words
somehow
did
not
quite
ring
true
those
last
words
in
particular
did
not
ring
true
there
lay
in
her
manner
just
out
of
sight
i
felt
this
suggestion
of
the
exact
reverse
of
unrest
shrinking
almost
of
anxiety
certain
small
strings
in
her
seemed
was
the
slang
expression
that
crossed
my
mind
i
looked
rather
searchingly
into
her
face
as
she
was
telling
me
this
only
the
evenings
she
added
noticing
my
query
yet
rather
avoiding
my
eyes
the
evenings
are
well
rather
heavy
sometimes
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
keep
the
strong
air
after
london
makes
you
drowsy
i
suggested
and
you
like
to
get
early
to
frances
turned
and
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
steadily
on
the
contrary
bill
i
dislike
going
to
bed
here
and
mabel
goes
so
she
said
it
lightly
enough
fingering
the
disorder
upon
my
in
such
a
stupid
way
that
i
saw
her
mind
was
working
in
another
direction
altogether
she
looked
up
suddenly
with
a
kind
of
nervousness
from
the
brush
and
scissors
billy
she
said
abruptly
lowering
her
voice
isn
t
it
odd
but
i
sleeping
alone
here
i
can
t
make
it
out
quite
i
ve
never
felt
such
a
thing
before
in
my
life
do
you
think
it
s
all
nonsense
and
she
laughed
with
her
lips
but
not
with
her
eyes
there
was
a
note
of
defiance
in
her
i
failed
to
understand
nothing
a
nature
like
yours
feels
strongly
is
nonsense
frances
i
replied
soothingly
but
i
too
answered
with
my
lips
only
for
another
part
of
my
mind
was
working
elsewhere
and
among
uncomfortable
things
a
touch
of
bewilderment
passed
over
me
i
was
not
certain
how
best
to
continue
if
i
laughed
she
would
tell
me
no
more
yet
if
i
took
her
too
seriously
the
strings
would
tighten
further
instinctively
then
this
flashed
rapidly
across
me
that
something
of
what
she
felt
i
had
also
felt
though
interpreting
it
differently
vague
it
was
as
the
coming
of
rain
or
storm
that
announce
themselves
hours
in
advance
with
their
hint
of
faint
unsettling
excitement
in
the
air
i
had
been
but
a
short
hour
in
the
house
big
comfortable
luxurious
house
but
had
experienced
this
sense
of
being
unsettled
unfixed
fluctuating
a
kind
of
impermanence
that
transient
lodgers
in
hotels
must
feel
but
that
a
guest
in
a
friend
s
home
ought
not
to
feel
be
the
visit
short
or
long
to
frances
an
impressionable
woman
the
feeling
had
come
in
the
terms
of
alarm
she
disliked
sleeping
alone
while
yet
she
longed
to
sleep
the
precise
idea
in
my
mind
evaded
capture
merely
brushing
through
me
out
of
sight
i
realised
only
that
we
both
felt
the
same
thing
and
that
neither
of
us
could
get
at
it
clearly
degrees
of
unrest
we
felt
but
the
actual
thing
did
not
disclose
itself
it
did
not
happen
i
felt
strangely
at
sea
for
a
moment
frances
would
interpret
hesitation
as
endorsement
and
encouragement
might
be
the
last
thing
that
could
help
her
sleeping
in
a
strange
house
i
answered
at
length
is
often
difficult
at
first
and
one
feels
lonely
after
fifteen
months
in
our
tiny
flat
one
feels
lost
and
in
a
big
house
it
s
an
uncomfortable
feeling
i
know
it
well
and
this
a
barrack
isn
t
it
the
masses
of
furniture
only
make
it
worse
one
feels
in
storage
somewhere
underground
the
furniture
doesn
t
furnish
one
must
never
yield
to
fancies
though
frances
looked
away
towards
the
windows
she
seemed
disappointed
a
little
after
our
chelsea
i
went
on
quickly
it
seems
isolated
but
she
did
not
turn
back
and
clearly
i
was
saying
the
wrong
thing
a
wave
of
pity
rushed
suddenly
over
me
was
she
really
frightened
perhaps
she
was
imaginative
i
knew
but
never
moody
common
sense
was
strong
in
her
though
she
had
her
times
of
hypersensitiveness
i
caught
the
echo
of
some
unreasoning
big
alarm
in
her
she
stood
there
gazing
across
my
balcony
towards
the
sea
of
wooded
country
that
spread
dim
and
vague
in
the
obscurity
of
the
dusk
the
deepening
shadows
entered
the
room
i
fancied
from
the
grounds
below
following
her
abstracted
gaze
a
moment
i
experienced
a
curious
sharp
desire
to
leave
to
escape
out
yonder
was
wind
and
space
and
freedom
this
enormous
building
was
oppressive
silent
still
great
catacombs
occurred
to
me
things
beneath
the
ground
imprisonment
and
capture
i
believe
i
even
shuddered
a
little
i
touched
her
shoulder
she
turned
round
slowly
and
we
looked
with
a
certain
deliberation
into
each
other
s
eyes
fanny
i
asked
more
gravely
than
i
intended
you
are
not
frightened
are
you
nothing
has
happened
has
it
she
replied
with
emphasis
of
course
not
how
could
it
i
mean
why
should
i
she
stammered
as
though
the
wrong
sentence
flustered
her
a
second
it
s
simply
that
i
have
this
ter
this
dislike
of
sleeping
naturally
my
first
thought
was
how
easy
it
would
be
to
cut
our
visit
short
but
i
did
not
say
this
had
it
been
a
true
solution
frances
would
have
said
it
for
me
long
ago
wouldn
t
mabel
with
you
i
said
instead
or
give
you
an
adjoining
room
so
that
you
could
leave
the
door
between
you
open
there
s
space
enough
heaven
and
then
as
the
gong
sounded
in
the
hall
below
for
dinner
she
said
as
with
an
effort
this
thing
mabel
did
ask
me
on
the
third
night
after
i
had
told
her
but
i
you
d
rather
be
alone
than
with
her
i
asked
with
a
certain
relief
her
reply
was
so
gravely
given
a
child
would
have
known
there
was
more
behind
it
not
that
but
that
she
did
not
really
want
i
had
a
moment
s
intuition
and
acted
on
it
impulsively
she
feels
it
too
perhaps
but
wishes
to
face
it
by
herself
and
get
over
it
my
sister
bowed
her
head
and
the
gesture
made
me
realise
of
a
sudden
how
grave
and
solemn
our
talk
had
grown
as
though
some
portentous
thing
were
under
discussion
it
had
come
of
itself
indefinite
as
a
gradual
change
of
temperature
yet
neither
of
us
knew
its
nature
for
apparently
neither
of
us
could
state
it
plainly
nothing
happened
even
in
our
words
that
my
impression
she
said
that
if
she
yields
to
it
she
encourages
it
and
a
habit
forms
so
easily
just
think
she
added
with
a
faint
smile
that
was
the
first
sign
of
lightness
she
had
yet
betrayed
what
a
nuisance
it
would
be
everywhere
if
everybody
was
afraid
of
being
alone
like
i
snatched
readily
at
the
chance
we
laughed
a
little
though
it
was
a
quiet
kind
of
laughter
that
seemed
wrong
i
took
her
arm
and
led
her
towards
the
door
disastrous
in
fact
i
agreed
she
raised
her
voice
to
its
normal
pitch
again
as
i
had
done
no
doubt
it
will
pass
she
said
now
that
you
have
come
of
course
it
s
chiefly
my
her
tone
was
lighter
though
nothing
could
convince
me
that
the
matter
itself
was
light
just
then
and
in
any
case
tightening
her
grip
on
my
arm
as
we
passed
into
the
bright
enormous
corridor
and
caught
sight
of
franklyn
waiting
in
the
cheerless
hall
below
i
m
glad
you
re
here
bill
and
mabel
i
know
is
if
it
doesn
t
pass
i
just
had
time
to
whisper
with
a
feeble
attempt
at
jollity
i
ll
come
at
night
and
snore
outside
your
door
after
that
you
ll
be
so
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
that
you
won
t
mind
being
that
s
a
bargain
said
frances
i
shook
my
hostess
by
the
hand
made
a
banal
remark
about
the
long
interval
since
last
we
met
and
walked
behind
them
into
the
great
dimly
lit
by
candles
wondering
in
my
heart
how
long
my
sister
and
i
should
stay
and
why
in
the
world
we
had
ever
left
our
cosy
little
flat
to
enter
this
desolation
of
riches
and
false
luxury
at
all
the
unsightly
picture
of
the
late
samuel
franklyn
stared
down
upon
me
from
the
farther
end
of
the
room
above
the
mighty
mantelpiece
he
looked
i
thought
like
some
pompous
heavenly
butler
who
denied
to
all
the
world
and
to
us
in
particular
the
right
of
entry
without
presentation
cards
signed
by
his
hand
as
proof
that
we
belonged
to
his
own
exclusive
set
the
majority
to
his
deep
grief
and
in
spite
of
all
his
prayers
on
their
behalf
must
burn
and
perish
iv
with
the
instinct
of
the
healthy
bachelor
i
always
try
to
make
myself
a
nest
in
the
place
i
live
in
be
it
for
long
or
short
whether
visiting
in
or
in
hotel
the
first
essential
is
this
nest
one
s
own
things
built
into
the
walls
as
a
bird
builds
in
its
feathers
it
may
look
desolate
and
uncomfortable
enough
to
others
because
the
central
detail
is
neither
bed
nor
wardrobe
sofa
nor
but
a
good
solid
that
does
not
wriggle
and
that
has
wide
and
the
towers
is
vividly
described
for
me
by
the
single
fact
that
i
could
not
nest
there
i
took
several
days
to
discover
this
but
the
first
impression
of
impermanence
was
truer
than
i
knew
the
feathers
of
the
mind
refused
here
to
lie
one
way
they
ruffled
pointed
and
grew
wild
luxurious
furniture
does
not
mean
comfort
i
might
as
well
have
tried
to
settle
down
in
the
sofa
and
department
of
a
big
shop
my
bedroom
was
easily
managed
it
was
the
private
prepared
especially
for
my
reception
that
made
me
feel
alien
and
outcast
externally
it
was
all
one
could
desire
an
to
the
great
library
with
not
one
but
two
generous
oak
tables
to
say
nothing
of
smaller
ones
against
the
walls
with
capacious
drawers
there
were
mechanical
devices
for
holding
books
perfect
light
quiet
as
in
a
church
and
no
approach
but
across
the
huge
adjoining
room
yet
it
did
not
invite
i
hope
you
ll
be
able
to
work
here
said
my
little
hostess
the
next
morning
as
she
took
me
in
her
only
visit
to
it
while
i
stayed
in
the
house
and
showed
me
the
catalogue
it
s
absolutely
quiet
and
no
one
will
disturb
if
you
can
t
bill
you
re
not
much
good
laughed
frances
who
was
on
her
arm
even
i
could
write
in
a
study
like
this
i
glanced
with
pleasure
at
the
ample
tables
the
sheets
of
thick
the
rulers
and
all
the
other
immaculate
paraphernalia
it
s
perfect
i
answered
with
a
secret
thrill
yet
feeling
a
little
foolish
this
was
for
gibbon
or
carlyle
rather
than
for
my
insignificancies
if
i
can
t
write
masterpieces
here
it
s
certainly
not
fault
and
i
turned
with
gratitude
to
franklyn
she
was
looking
straight
at
me
and
there
was
a
question
in
her
small
pale
eyes
i
did
not
understand
was
she
noting
the
effect
upon
me
i
wondered
you
ll
write
here
perhaps
a
story
about
the
house
she
said
thompson
will
bring
you
anything
you
want
you
only
have
to
she
pointed
to
the
electric
bell
on
the
central
table
the
wire
running
neatly
down
the
leg
no
one
has
ever
worked
here
before
and
the
library
has
been
hardly
used
since
it
was
put
in
so
there
s
no
previous
atmosphere
to
affect
your
imagination
er
we
laughed
bill
isn
t
that
sort
said
my
sister
while
i
wished
they
would
go
out
and
leave
me
to
arrange
my
little
nest
and
set
to
work
i
thought
of
course
it
was
the
huge
listening
library
that
made
me
feel
so
inconsiderable
the
fifteen
thousand
silent
staring
books
the
solemn
aisles
the
deep
eloquent
shelves
but
when
the
women
had
gone
and
i
was
alone
the
beginning
of
the
truth
crept
over
me
and
i
felt
that
first
hint
of
disconsolateness
which
later
became
an
imperative
no
the
mind
shut
down
images
ceased
to
rise
and
flow
i
read
made
copious
notes
but
i
wrote
no
single
line
at
the
towers
nothing
completed
itself
there
nothing
happened
the
morning
sunshine
poured
into
the
library
through
ten
long
narrow
windows
birds
were
singing
the
autumn
air
rich
with
a
faint
aroma
of
november
melancholy
that
stung
the
imagination
pleasantly
filled
my
i
looked
out
upon
the
undulating
wooded
landscape
hemmed
in
by
the
sweep
of
distant
downs
and
i
tasted
a
whiff
of
the
sea
rooks
cawed
as
they
floated
above
the
elms
and
there
were
lazy
cows
in
the
nearer
meadows
a
dozen
times
i
tried
to
make
my
nest
and
settle
down
to
work
and
a
dozen
times
like
a
turning
fastidious
dog
upon
a
i
rearranged
my
chair
and
books
and
papers
the
temptation
of
the
catalogue
and
shelves
of
course
was
accountable
for
much
yet
not
i
felt
for
all
that
was
a
manageable
seduction
my
work
moreover
was
not
of
the
creative
kind
that
requires
absolute
absorption
it
was
the
mere
readable
presentation
of
data
i
had
accumulated
my
were
charged
with
facts
ready
to
tabulate
facts
too
that
interested
me
keenly
a
mere
effort
of
the
will
was
necessary
and
concentration
of
no
difficult
kind
yet
somehow
it
seemed
beyond
me
something
for
ever
pushed
the
facts
into
disorder
and
in
the
end
i
sat
in
the
sunshine
dipping
into
a
dozen
books
selected
from
the
shelves
outside
vexed
with
myself
and
only
it
i
felt
restless
i
wanted
to
be
elsewhere
and
even
while
i
read
attention
wandered
frances
mabel
her
late
husband
the
house
and
grounds
each
in
turn
and
sometimes
all
together
rose
uninvited
into
the
stream
of
thought
hindering
any
consecutive
flow
of
work
in
disconnected
fashion
came
these
pictures
that
interrupted
concentration
yet
presenting
themselves
as
broken
fragments
of
a
bigger
thing
my
mind
already
groped
for
unconsciously
they
fluttered
round
this
hidden
thing
of
which
they
were
aspects
fugitive
interpretations
no
one
of
them
bringing
complete
revelation
there
was
no
adjective
such
as
pleasant
or
unpleasant
that
i
could
attach
to
what
i
felt
beyond
that
the
result
was
unsettling
vague
as
the
atmosphere
of
a
dream
it
yet
persisted
and
i
could
not
dissipate
it
isolated
words
or
phrases
in
the
lines
i
read
sent
questions
scouring
across
my
mind
sure
sign
that
the
deeper
part
of
me
was
restless
and
ill
at
ease
rather
trivial
questions
too
interrogations
as
of
a
puzzled
or
curious
child
why
was
my
sister
afraid
to
sleep
alone
and
why
did
her
friend
feel
a
similar
repugnance
yet
seek
to
conquer
it
why
was
the
solid
luxury
of
the
house
without
comfort
its
shelter
without
the
sense
of
permanence
why
had
franklyn
asked
to
come
artists
unbelieving
vagabonds
types
at
the
farthest
possible
remove
from
the
saved
sheep
of
her
husband
s
household
had
a
reaction
set
in
against
the
hysteria
of
her
conversion
i
had
seen
no
signs
of
religious
fervour
in
her
her
atmosphere
was
that
of
an
ordinary
woman
yet
a
woman
of
the
world
lifeless
though
a
little
perhaps
now
that
i
came
to
think
about
it
she
had
made
no
definite
impression
upon
me
of
any
kind
and
my
thoughts
ran
vaguely
after
this
fragile
clue
closing
my
book
i
let
them
run
for
with
this
chance
reflection
came
the
discovery
that
i
could
not
her
clearly
could
not
feel
her
soul
her
personality
her
face
her
small
pale
eyes
her
dress
and
body
and
walk
all
these
stood
before
me
like
a
photograph
but
her
self
evaded
me
she
seemed
not
there
lifeless
empty
a
shadow
nothing
the
picture
was
disagreeable
and
i
put
it
by
instantly
she
melted
out
as
though
light
thought
had
conjured
up
a
phantom
that
had
no
real
existence
and
at
that
very
moment
singularly
enough
my
eye
caught
sight
of
her
moving
past
the
window
going
silently
along
the
gravel
path
i
watched
her
a
sudden
new
sensation
gripping
me
there
goes
a
prisoner
my
thought
instantly
ran
one
who
wishes
to
escape
but
can
not
what
brought
the
outlandish
notion
heaven
only
knows
the
house
was
of
her
own
choice
she
was
twice
an
heiress
and
the
world
lay
open
at
her
feet
yet
she
stayed
unhappy
frightened
caught
all
this
flashed
over
me
and
made
a
sharp
impression
even
before
i
had
time
to
dismiss
it
as
absurd
but
a
moment
later
explanation
offered
itself
though
it
seemed
as
as
the
original
impression
my
mind
being
logical
was
obliged
to
provide
something
apparently
for
franklyn
while
dressed
to
go
out
with
thick
a
pointed
stick
and
a
tied
on
with
a
veil
as
for
the
windy
lanes
was
obviously
content
to
go
no
farther
than
the
little
garden
paths
the
costume
was
a
sham
and
a
pretence
it
was
this
and
her
lithe
quick
movements
that
suggested
a
caged
creature
a
creature
tamed
by
fear
and
cruelty
that
cloaked
themselves
in
kindness
pacing
up
and
down
unable
to
realise
why
it
got
no
farther
but
always
met
the
same
bars
in
exactly
the
same
place
the
mind
in
her
was
barred
i
watched
her
go
along
the
paths
and
down
the
steps
from
one
terrace
to
another
until
the
laurels
hid
her
altogether
and
into
this
mere
imagining
of
a
moment
came
a
hint
of
something
slightly
disagreeable
for
which
my
mind
search
as
it
would
found
no
explanation
at
all
i
remembered
then
certain
other
little
things
they
dropped
into
the
picture
of
their
own
accord
in
a
mind
not
deliberately
hunting
for
clues
pieces
of
a
puzzle
sometimes
come
together
in
this
way
bringing
revelation
so
that
for
a
second
there
flashed
across
me
vanishing
instantly
again
before
i
could
consider
it
a
large
distressing
thought
that
i
can
only
describe
vaguely
as
a
shadow
dark
and
ugly
oppressive
certainly
it
might
be
described
with
something
torn
and
dreadful
about
the
edges
that
suggested
pain
and
strife
and
terror
the
interior
of
a
prison
with
two
rows
of
occupied
condemned
cells
seen
years
ago
in
new
york
sprang
to
memory
after
it
the
connection
between
the
two
impossible
to
surmise
even
but
the
certain
other
little
things
mentioned
above
were
these
that
franklyn
in
last
night
s
dinner
talk
had
always
referred
to
this
house
but
never
called
it
home
and
had
emphasised
unnecessarily
for
a
woman
our
great
kindness
in
coming
down
to
stay
so
long
with
her
another
time
in
answer
to
my
futile
compliment
about
the
stately
rooms
she
said
quietly
it
is
an
enormous
house
for
so
small
a
party
but
i
stay
here
very
little
and
only
till
i
get
it
straight
the
three
of
us
were
going
up
the
great
staircase
to
bed
as
this
was
said
and
not
knowing
quite
her
meaning
i
dropped
the
subject
it
edged
delicate
ground
i
felt
frances
added
no
word
of
her
own
it
now
occurred
to
me
abruptly
that
stay
was
the
word
made
use
of
when
live
would
have
been
more
natural
how
insignificant
to
recall
yet
why
did
they
suggest
themselves
just
at
this
moment
and
on
going
to
frances
s
room
to
make
sure
she
was
not
nervous
or
lonely
i
realised
abruptly
that
franklyn
of
course
had
talked
with
in
a
confidential
sense
that
i
as
a
mere
visiting
brother
could
not
share
frances
had
told
me
nothing
i
might
easily
have
wormed
it
out
of
her
had
i
not
felt
that
for
us
to
discuss
further
our
hostess
and
her
house
merely
because
we
were
under
the
roof
together
was
not
quite
nice
or
loyal
i
ll
call
you
bill
if
i
m
scared
she
had
laughed
as
we
parted
my
room
being
just
across
the
big
corridor
from
her
own
i
had
fallen
asleep
thinking
what
in
the
world
was
meant
by
getting
it
straight
and
now
in
my
to
the
library
on
the
second
morning
sitting
among
piles
of
foolscap
and
sheets
of
spotless
all
useless
to
me
these
slight
hints
came
back
and
helped
to
frame
the
big
vague
shadow
i
have
mentioned
up
to
the
neck
in
this
shadow
almost
drowned
yet
just
treading
water
stood
the
figure
of
my
hostess
in
her
walking
costume
frances
and
i
seemed
swimming
to
her
aid
the
shadow
was
large
enough
to
include
both
house
and
grounds
but
farther
than
that
i
could
not
see
dismissing
it
i
fell
to
reading
my
purloined
book
again
before
i
turned
another
page
however
another
startling
detail
leaped
out
at
me
the
figure
of
franklyn
in
the
shadow
was
not
living
it
floated
helplessly
like
a
doll
or
puppet
that
has
no
life
in
it
it
was
both
pathetic
and
dreadful
any
one
who
sits
in
reverie
thus
of
course
may
see
similar
ridiculous
pictures
when
the
will
no
longer
guides
construction
the
incongruities
of
dreams
are
thus
explained
i
merely
record
the
picture
as
it
came
that
it
remained
by
me
for
several
days
just
as
vivid
dreams
do
is
neither
here
nor
there
i
did
not
allow
myself
to
dwell
upon
it
the
curious
thing
perhaps
is
that
from
this
moment
i
date
my
inclination
though
not
yet
my
desire
to
leave
i
purposely
say
to
i
can
not
quite
remember
when
the
word
changed
to
that
aggressive
frantic
thing
which
is
escape
v
we
were
left
delightfully
to
ourselves
in
this
pretentious
country
mansion
with
the
soul
of
a
villa
frances
took
up
her
painting
again
and
the
weather
being
propitious
spent
hours
out
of
doors
sketching
flowers
trees
and
nooks
of
woodland
garden
even
the
house
itself
where
bits
of
it
peered
suggestively
across
the
orchards
franklyn
seemed
always
busy
about
something
or
other
and
never
interfered
with
us
except
to
propose
motoring
tea
in
another
part
of
the
lawn
and
so
forth
she
flitted
everywhere
preoccupied
yet
apparently
doing
nothing
the
house
engulfed
her
rather
no
visitors
called
for
one
thing
she
was
not
supposed
to
be
back
from
abroad
yet
and
for
another
i
think
the
neighbourhood
her
husband
s
neighbourhood
was
puzzled
by
her
sudden
cessation
from
good
works
brigades
and
temperance
societies
did
not
ask
to
hold
their
meetings
in
the
big
hall
and
the
vicar
arranged
the
in
another
s
field
without
explanation
the
portrait
in
the
and
the
presence
of
the
housekeeper
with
the
burnt
indeed
were
the
only
reminders
of
the
man
who
once
had
lived
here
marsh
retained
her
place
in
silence
sinecure
as
it
doubtless
was
yet
with
no
hint
of
that
suppressed
disapproval
one
might
have
expected
from
her
indeed
there
was
nothing
positive
to
disapprove
since
nothing
worldly
entered
grounds
or
building
in
her
master
s
lifetime
she
had
been
another
brand
snatched
from
the
burning
and
it
had
then
been
her
custom
to
give
vociferous
testimony
at
the
revival
meetings
where
he
adorned
the
platform
and
led
in
streams
of
prayer
i
saw
her
sometimes
on
the
stairs
hovering
wandering
and
and
the
idea
came
to
me
once
that
this
woman
somehow
formed
a
link
with
the
departed
influence
of
her
bigoted
employer
she
alone
among
us
to
the
house
and
looked
at
home
there
when
i
saw
her
talking
oh
with
such
correct
and
respectful
mien
to
franklyn
i
had
the
feeling
that
for
all
her
unaggressive
attitude
she
yet
exerted
some
influence
that
sought
to
make
her
mistress
stay
in
the
building
for
ever
live
there
she
would
prevent
her
escape
prevent
her
getting
it
straight
again
thwart
somehow
her
will
to
freedom
if
she
could
the
idea
in
me
was
of
the
most
fleeting
kind
but
another
time
when
i
came
down
late
at
night
to
get
a
book
from
the
library
and
found
her
sitting
in
the
hall
alone
the
impression
left
upon
me
was
the
reverse
of
fleeting
i
can
never
forget
the
vivid
disagreeable
effect
it
produced
upon
me
what
was
she
doing
there
at
eleven
at
night
all
alone
in
the
darkness
she
was
sitting
upright
stiff
in
a
big
chair
below
the
clock
it
gave
me
a
turn
it
was
so
incongruous
and
odd
she
rose
quietly
as
i
turned
the
corner
of
the
stairs
and
asked
me
respectfully
her
eyes
cast
down
as
usual
whether
i
had
finished
with
the
library
so
that
she
might
lock
up
there
was
no
more
to
it
than
that
but
the
picture
stayed
with
me
unpleasantly
these
various
impressions
came
to
me
at
odd
moments
of
course
and
not
in
a
single
sequence
as
i
now
relate
them
i
was
hard
at
work
before
three
days
were
past
not
writing
as
explained
but
reading
making
notes
and
gathering
material
from
the
library
for
future
use
it
was
in
chance
moments
that
these
curious
flashes
came
catching
me
unawares
with
a
touch
of
surprise
that
sometimes
made
me
start
for
they
proved
that
my
was
still
conscious
of
the
shadow
and
that
far
away
out
of
sight
lay
the
cause
of
it
that
left
me
with
a
vague
unrest
unsettled
seeking
to
nest
in
a
place
that
did
not
want
me
only
when
this
deeper
part
knows
harmony
perhaps
can
good
brain
work
result
and
my
inability
to
write
was
thus
explained
certainly
i
was
always
seeking
for
something
here
i
could
not
find
an
explanation
that
continually
evaded
me
nothing
but
these
trivial
hints
offered
themselves
lumped
together
however
they
had
the
effect
of
defining
the
shadow
a
little
i
became
more
and
more
aware
of
its
very
real
existence
and
if
i
have
made
little
mention
of
frances
and
my
hostess
in
this
connection
it
is
because
they
contributed
at
first
little
or
nothing
towards
the
discovery
of
what
this
story
tries
to
tell
our
life
was
wholly
external
normal
quiet
and
uneventful
conversation
banal
franklyn
s
conversation
in
particular
they
said
nothing
that
suggested
revelation
both
were
in
this
shadow
and
both
knew
that
they
were
in
it
but
neither
betrayed
by
word
or
act
a
hint
of
interpretation
they
talked
privately
no
doubt
but
of
that
i
can
report
no
details
and
so
it
was
that
after
ten
days
of
a
very
commonplace
visit
i
found
myself
looking
straight
into
the
face
of
a
strangeness
that
defied
capture
at
close
quarters
there
s
something
here
that
never
happens
were
the
words
that
rose
in
my
mind
and
that
s
why
none
of
us
can
speak
of
and
as
i
looked
out
of
the
window
and
watched
the
vulgar
blackbirds
with
toes
turned
in
boring
out
their
worms
i
realised
sharply
that
even
they
as
indeed
everything
large
and
small
in
the
house
and
grounds
shared
this
strangeness
and
were
twisted
out
of
normal
appearance
because
of
it
life
as
expressed
in
the
entire
place
was
crumpled
dwarfed
emasculated
god
s
meanings
here
were
crippled
his
love
of
joy
was
stunted
nothing
in
the
garden
danced
or
sang
there
was
hate
in
it
the
shadow
my
thought
hurried
on
to
completion
is
a
manifestation
of
hate
and
hate
is
the
and
then
i
sat
back
frightened
in
my
chair
for
i
knew
that
i
had
partly
found
the
truth
leaving
my
books
i
went
out
into
the
open
the
sky
was
overcast
yet
the
day
by
no
means
gloomy
for
a
soft
diffused
light
oozed
through
the
clouds
and
turned
all
things
warm
and
almost
summery
but
i
saw
the
grounds
now
in
their
nakedness
because
i
understood
hate
means
strife
and
the
two
together
weave
the
robe
that
terror
wears
having
no
religious
beliefs
myself
nor
belonging
to
any
set
of
dogmas
called
a
creed
i
could
stand
outside
these
feelings
and
observe
yet
they
soaked
into
me
sufficiently
for
me
to
grasp
sympathetically
what
others
with
more
cabined
souls
i
flattered
myself
might
feel
that
picture
in
the
stalked
everywhere
hid
behind
every
tree
peered
down
upon
me
from
the
peaked
ugliness
of
the
bourgeois
towers
and
left
the
impress
of
its
powerful
hand
upon
every
bed
of
flowers
you
must
not
do
this
you
must
not
do
that
went
past
me
through
the
air
you
must
not
leave
these
narrow
paths
said
the
rigid
iron
railings
of
black
you
shall
not
walk
here
was
written
on
the
lawns
keep
to
the
steps
don
t
pick
the
flowers
make
no
noise
of
laughter
singing
dancing
was
placarded
all
over
the
and
trespassers
will
be
not
prosecuted
but
hung
from
the
crest
of
and
holly
guarding
the
ends
of
each
artificial
terrace
stood
gaunt
implacable
policemen
warders
gaolers
come
with
us
they
chanted
or
be
damned
i
remember
feeling
quite
pleased
with
myself
that
i
had
discovered
this
obvious
explanation
of
the
the
place
breathed
out
that
the
posthumous
influence
of
heavy
old
samuel
franklyn
might
be
an
inadequate
solution
did
not
occur
to
me
by
getting
the
place
straight
again
his
widow
of
course
meant
forgetting
the
glamour
of
fear
and
foreboding
his
depressing
creed
had
temporarily
forced
upon
her
and
frances
being
did
not
speak
of
it
because
it
was
the
influence
of
the
man
her
friend
had
loved
i
felt
lighter
a
load
was
lifted
from
me
to
trace
the
unfamiliar
to
the
familiar
came
back
a
sentence
i
had
read
somewhere
is
to
it
was
a
real
relief
i
could
talk
with
frances
now
even
with
my
hostess
no
danger
of
treading
clumsily
for
the
key
was
in
my
hands
i
might
even
help
to
dissipate
the
shadow
to
get
it
straight
it
seemed
perhaps
our
long
invitation
was
explained
i
went
into
the
house
laughing
at
myself
a
little
perhaps
after
all
the
artist
s
outlook
with
no
hard
and
fast
dogmas
is
as
narrow
as
the
others
how
small
humanity
is
and
why
is
there
no
possible
and
true
combination
of
outlooks
the
feeling
of
unsettling
was
very
strong
in
me
just
then
in
spite
of
my
big
discovery
which
was
to
clear
everything
up
and
at
that
moment
i
ran
into
frances
on
the
stairs
with
a
portfolio
of
sketches
under
her
arm
it
came
across
me
then
abruptly
that
although
she
had
worked
a
great
deal
since
we
came
she
had
shown
me
nothing
it
struck
me
suddenly
as
odd
unnatural
the
way
she
tried
to
pass
me
now
confirmed
my
suspicion
that
well
that
her
results
were
hardly
what
they
ought
to
be
stand
and
deliver
i
laughed
stepping
in
front
of
her
i
ve
seen
nothing
you
ve
done
since
you
ve
been
here
and
as
a
rule
you
show
me
all
your
things
i
believe
they
are
atrocious
and
degrading
then
my
laughter
froze
she
made
a
sly
gesture
to
slip
past
me
and
i
almost
decided
to
let
her
go
for
the
expression
that
flashed
across
her
face
shocked
me
she
looked
uncomfortable
and
ashamed
the
colour
came
and
went
a
moment
in
her
cheeks
making
me
think
of
a
child
detected
in
some
secret
naughtiness
it
was
almost
fear
it
s
because
they
re
not
finished
then
i
said
dropping
the
tone
of
banter
or
because
they
re
too
good
for
me
to
understand
for
my
criticism
of
painting
she
told
me
was
crude
and
ignorant
sometimes
but
you
ll
let
me
see
them
later
won
t
you
frances
however
did
not
take
the
way
of
escape
i
offered
she
changed
her
mind
she
drew
the
portfolio
from
beneath
her
arm
instead
you
can
see
them
if
you
want
to
bill
she
said
quietly
and
her
tone
reminded
me
of
a
nurse
who
says
to
a
boy
just
grown
out
of
childhood
you
are
old
enough
now
to
look
upon
horror
and
ugliness
only
i
don
t
advise
i
do
want
to
i
said
and
made
to
go
downstairs
with
her
but
instead
she
said
in
the
same
low
voice
as
before
come
up
to
my
room
we
shall
be
undisturbed
so
i
guessed
that
she
had
been
on
her
way
to
show
the
paintings
to
our
hostess
but
did
not
care
for
us
all
three
to
see
them
together
my
mind
worked
furiously
mabel
asked
me
to
do
them
she
explained
in
a
tone
of
submissive
horror
once
the
door
was
shut
in
fact
she
begged
it
of
me
you
know
how
persistent
she
is
in
her
quiet
way
i
er
had
she
flushed
and
opened
the
portfolio
on
the
little
table
by
the
window
standing
behind
me
as
i
turned
the
sketches
over
sketches
of
the
grounds
and
trees
and
garden
in
the
first
moment
of
inspection
however
i
did
not
take
in
clearly
why
my
sister
s
sense
of
modesty
had
been
offended
for
my
attention
flashed
a
second
elsewhere
another
bit
of
the
puzzle
had
dropped
into
place
defining
still
further
the
nature
of
what
i
called
the
franklyn
i
now
remembered
had
suggested
to
me
in
the
library
that
i
might
perhaps
write
something
about
the
place
and
i
had
taken
it
for
one
of
her
banal
sentences
and
paid
no
further
attention
i
realised
now
that
it
was
said
in
earnest
she
wanted
our
interpretations
as
expressed
in
our
respective
talents
painting
and
writing
her
invitation
explained
she
left
us
to
ourselves
on
purpose
i
should
like
to
tear
them
up
frances
was
whispering
behind
me
with
a
shudder
only
i
promised
she
hesitated
a
moment
promised
not
to
i
asked
with
a
queer
feeling
of
distress
my
eyes
glued
to
the
papers
promised
always
to
show
them
to
her
first
she
finished
so
low
i
barely
caught
it
i
have
no
intuitive
immediate
grasp
of
the
value
of
paintings
results
come
to
me
slowly
and
though
every
one
believes
his
own
judgment
to
be
good
i
dare
not
claim
that
mine
is
worth
more
than
that
of
any
other
layman
frances
had
too
often
convicted
me
of
gross
ignorance
and
error
i
can
only
say
that
i
examined
these
sketches
with
a
feeling
of
amazement
that
contained
revulsion
if
not
actually
horror
and
disgust
they
were
outrageous
i
felt
hot
for
my
sister
and
it
was
a
relief
to
know
she
had
moved
across
the
room
on
some
pretence
or
other
and
did
not
examine
them
with
me
her
talent
of
course
is
mediocre
yet
she
has
her
moments
of
inspiration
moments
that
is
to
say
when
a
view
of
beauty
not
normally
her
own
flames
divinely
through
her
and
these
interpretations
struck
me
forcibly
as
being
thus
inspired
not
her
own
they
were
uncommonly
well
done
they
were
also
atrocious
the
meaning
in
them
however
was
never
more
than
hinted
there
the
unholy
skill
and
power
came
in
they
suggested
so
abominably
leaving
most
to
the
imagination
to
find
such
significance
in
a
bourgeois
villa
garden
and
to
interpret
it
with
such
delicate
yet
legible
certainty
was
a
kind
of
symbolism
that
was
sinister
even
diabolical
the
delicacy
was
her
own
but
the
point
of
view
was
another
s
and
the
word
that
rose
in
my
mind
was
not
the
gross
description
of
impure
but
the
more
fundamental
qualification
in
silence
i
turned
the
sketches
over
one
by
one
as
a
boy
hurries
through
the
pages
of
an
evil
book
lest
he
be
caught
what
does
mabel
do
with
them
i
asked
presently
in
a
low
tone
as
i
neared
the
end
does
she
keep
them
she
makes
notes
about
them
in
a
book
and
then
destroys
them
was
the
reply
from
the
end
of
the
room
i
heard
a
sigh
of
relief
i
m
glad
you
ve
seen
them
bill
i
wanted
you
to
but
was
afraid
to
show
them
you
understand
i
understand
was
my
reply
though
it
was
not
a
question
intended
to
be
answered
all
i
understood
really
was
that
mabel
s
mind
was
as
sweet
and
pure
as
my
sister
s
and
that
she
had
some
good
reason
for
what
she
did
she
destroyed
the
sketches
but
first
made
notes
it
was
an
interpretation
of
the
place
she
sought
i
felt
resentment
though
that
frances
should
waste
her
time
and
talent
when
she
might
be
doing
work
that
she
could
sell
naturally
i
felt
other
things
as
well
mabel
pays
me
five
guineas
for
each
one
i
heard
absolutely
i
stared
at
her
stupidly
a
moment
bereft
of
speech
or
wit
i
must
either
accept
or
go
away
she
went
on
calmly
but
a
little
white
i
ve
tried
everything
there
was
a
scene
the
third
day
i
was
here
when
i
showed
her
my
first
result
i
wanted
to
write
to
you
but
hesitated
it
s
unintentional
then
on
your
part
forgive
my
asking
it
frances
dear
i
blundered
hardly
knowing
what
to
think
or
say
between
the
lines
of
her
letter
came
back
to
me
i
mean
you
make
the
sketches
in
your
ordinary
way
and
the
result
comes
out
of
itself
so
to
speak
she
nodded
throwing
her
hands
out
like
a
frenchman
we
needn
t
keep
the
money
for
ourselves
bill
we
can
give
it
away
but
i
must
either
accept
or
leave
and
she
repeated
the
shrugging
gesture
she
sat
down
on
the
chair
facing
me
staring
helplessly
at
the
carpet
you
say
there
was
a
scene
i
went
on
presently
she
insisted
she
begged
me
to
continue
my
sister
replied
very
quietly
she
thinks
that
is
she
has
an
idea
or
theory
that
there
s
something
about
the
place
something
she
can
t
get
at
frances
stammered
badly
she
knew
i
did
not
encourage
her
wild
theories
something
she
feels
yes
i
helped
her
more
than
curious
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
bill
she
said
desperately
that
the
place
is
saturated
with
some
influence
that
she
is
herself
too
positive
or
too
stupid
to
interpret
she
s
trying
to
make
herself
negative
and
receptive
as
she
calls
it
but
can
t
of
course
succeed
haven
t
you
noticed
how
dull
and
impersonal
and
insipid
she
seems
as
though
she
had
no
personality
she
thinks
impressions
will
come
to
her
that
way
but
they
don
t
so
she
s
trying
me
us
what
she
calls
the
sensitive
and
impressionable
artistic
temperament
she
says
that
until
she
is
sure
exactly
what
this
influence
is
she
can
t
fight
it
turn
it
out
get
the
house
straight
as
she
phrases
remembering
my
own
singular
impressions
i
felt
more
lenient
than
i
might
otherwise
have
done
i
tried
to
keep
impatience
out
of
my
voice
and
this
influence
what
whose
is
it
we
used
the
pronoun
that
followed
in
the
same
breath
for
i
answered
my
own
question
at
the
same
moment
as
she
did
our
heads
nodded
involuntarily
towards
the
floor
the
being
directly
underneath
and
my
heart
sank
my
curiosity
died
away
on
the
instant
i
felt
bored
a
commonplace
haunted
house
was
the
last
thing
in
the
world
to
amuse
or
interest
me
the
mere
thought
exasperated
with
its
suggestions
of
imagination
overwrought
nerves
hysteria
and
the
rest
mingled
with
my
other
feelings
was
certainly
disappointment
to
see
a
figure
or
feel
a
presence
and
report
from
day
to
day
strange
incidents
to
each
other
would
be
a
form
of
weariness
i
could
never
tolerate
but
really
frances
i
said
firmly
after
a
moment
s
pause
it
s
too
this
explanation
a
curse
you
know
belongs
to
the
ghost
stories
of
early
victorian
and
only
my
positive
conviction
that
there
something
after
all
worth
discovering
and
that
it
most
certainly
was
this
prevented
my
suggesting
that
we
terminate
our
visit
forthwith
or
as
soon
as
we
decently
could
this
is
not
a
haunted
house
whatever
it
is
i
concluded
somewhat
vehemently
bringing
my
hand
down
upon
her
odious
portfolio
my
sister
s
reply
revived
my
curiosity
sharply
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
say
that
mabel
says
exactly
the
same
is
in
it
but
it
s
something
more
than
that
alone
something
far
bigger
and
more
her
sentence
seemed
to
indicate
the
sketches
and
though
i
caught
the
inference
i
did
not
take
it
up
having
no
desire
to
discuss
them
with
her
just
then
indeed
if
ever
i
merely
stared
at
her
and
listened
questions
i
felt
sure
would
be
of
little
use
it
was
better
she
should
say
her
thought
in
her
own
way
he
is
one
influence
the
most
recent
she
went
on
slowly
and
always
very
calmly
but
there
are
others
deeper
layers
as
it
were
underneath
if
his
were
the
only
one
something
would
happen
but
nothing
ever
does
happen
the
others
hinder
and
prevent
as
though
each
were
struggling
to
i
had
felt
it
already
myself
the
idea
was
rather
horrible
i
shivered
that
s
what
is
so
ugly
about
it
that
nothing
ever
happens
she
said
there
is
this
endless
anticipation
always
on
the
dry
edge
of
a
result
that
never
materialises
it
is
torture
mabel
is
at
her
wits
end
you
see
and
when
she
begged
me
what
i
felt
about
my
sketches
i
mean
she
stammered
badly
as
before
i
stopped
her
i
had
judged
too
hastily
that
queer
symbolism
in
her
paintings
pagan
and
yet
not
innocent
was
i
understood
the
result
of
mixture
i
did
not
pretend
to
understand
but
at
least
i
could
be
patient
i
consequently
held
my
peace
we
did
talk
on
a
little
longer
but
it
was
more
general
talk
that
avoided
successfully
our
hostess
the
paintings
wild
theories
and
until
at
length
the
emotion
frances
had
hitherto
so
successfully
kept
under
burst
vehemently
forth
again
it
had
hidden
between
her
calm
sentences
as
it
had
hidden
between
the
lines
of
her
letter
it
swept
her
now
from
head
to
foot
packed
tight
in
the
thing
she
then
said
then
bill
if
it
is
not
an
ordinary
haunted
house
she
asked
is
the
words
were
commonplace
enough
the
emotion
was
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
that
trembled
in
the
gesture
she
made
leaning
forward
and
clasping
both
hands
upon
her
knees
and
in
the
slight
blanching
of
her
cheeks
as
her
brave
eyes
asked
the
question
and
searched
my
own
with
anxiety
that
bordered
upon
panic
in
that
moment
she
put
herself
under
my
protection
i
winced
and
why
she
added
lowering
her
voice
to
a
still
and
furtive
whisper
does
nothing
ever
happen
if
only
this
with
great
emphasis
something
happen
break
this
awful
tension
bring
relief
it
s
the
waiting
i
can
not
and
she
shivered
all
over
as
she
said
it
a
touch
of
wildness
in
her
eyes
i
would
have
given
much
to
have
made
a
true
and
satisfactory
answer
my
mind
searched
frantically
for
a
moment
but
in
vain
there
lay
no
sufficient
answer
in
me
i
felt
what
she
felt
though
with
differences
no
conclusive
explanation
lay
within
reach
nothing
happened
eager
as
i
was
to
shoot
the
entire
business
into
the
rubbish
heap
where
ignorance
and
superstition
discharge
their
poisonous
weeds
i
could
not
honestly
accomplish
this
to
treat
frances
as
a
child
and
merely
explain
away
would
be
to
strain
her
confidence
in
my
protection
so
affectionately
claimed
it
would
further
be
dishonest
to
myself
weak
besides
to
deny
that
i
had
also
felt
the
strain
and
tension
even
as
she
did
while
my
mind
continued
searching
i
returned
her
stare
in
silence
and
frances
then
with
more
honesty
and
insight
than
my
own
gave
suddenly
the
answer
herself
an
answer
whose
truth
and
adequacy
so
far
as
they
went
i
could
not
readily
gainsay
i
think
bill
because
it
is
too
big
to
happen
here
to
happen
anywhere
indeed
all
at
once
and
too
awful
to
have
tossed
the
sentence
aside
as
nonsense
argued
it
away
proved
that
it
was
really
meaningless
would
have
been
easy
at
any
other
time
or
in
any
other
place
and
had
the
past
week
brought
me
none
of
the
vivid
impressions
it
had
brought
me
this
is
doubtless
what
i
should
have
done
my
narrowness
again
was
proved
we
understand
in
others
only
what
we
have
in
ourselves
but
her
explanation
in
a
measure
i
knew
was
true
it
hinted
at
the
strife
and
struggle
that
my
notion
of
a
shadow
had
seemed
to
cover
thinly
perhaps
i
murmured
lamely
waiting
in
vain
for
her
to
say
more
but
you
said
just
now
that
you
felt
the
thing
was
in
layers
as
it
were
do
you
mean
each
one
each
influence
fighting
for
the
upper
hand
i
used
her
phraseology
to
conceal
my
own
poverty
terminology
after
all
was
nothing
provided
we
could
reach
the
idea
itself
her
eyes
said
yes
she
had
her
clear
conception
arrived
at
independently
as
was
her
way
and
unlike
her
sex
she
kept
it
clear
unsmothered
by
too
many
words
one
set
of
influences
gets
at
me
another
gets
at
you
it
s
according
to
our
temperaments
i
she
glanced
significantly
at
the
vile
portfolio
sometimes
they
are
mixed
and
therefore
false
there
has
always
been
in
me
more
than
in
you
the
pagan
thing
perhaps
though
never
thank
god
like
the
frank
confession
of
course
invited
my
own
as
it
was
meant
to
do
yet
it
was
difficult
to
find
the
words
what
i
have
felt
in
this
place
frances
i
honestly
can
hardly
tell
you
because
er
my
impressions
have
not
arranged
themselves
in
any
definite
form
i
can
describe
the
strife
the
agony
of
escape
and
the
unrest
a
sort
of
prison
atmosphere
this
i
have
felt
at
different
times
and
with
varying
degrees
of
strength
but
i
find
as
yet
no
final
label
to
attach
i
couldn
t
say
pagan
christian
or
anything
like
that
i
mean
as
you
do
as
with
the
blind
and
deaf
you
may
have
an
intensification
of
certain
senses
denied
to
me
or
even
another
sense
altogether
in
embryo
perhaps
she
stopped
me
anxious
to
keep
to
the
point
you
feel
it
as
mabel
does
she
feels
the
whole
thing
that
also
is
possible
i
said
very
slowly
i
was
thinking
behind
my
words
her
odd
remark
that
it
was
big
and
awful
came
back
upon
me
as
true
a
vast
sensation
of
distress
and
discomfort
swept
me
suddenly
pity
was
in
it
and
a
fierce
contempt
a
savage
bitter
anger
as
well
fury
against
some
sham
authority
was
part
of
it
frances
i
said
caught
unawares
and
dropping
all
pretence
what
in
the
world
can
it
be
i
looked
hard
at
her
for
some
minutes
neither
of
us
spoke
have
felt
no
desire
to
interpret
it
she
asked
presently
mabel
did
suggest
my
writing
something
about
the
house
was
my
reply
but
i
ve
felt
nothing
imperative
that
sort
of
writing
is
not
my
line
you
know
my
only
feeling
i
added
noticing
that
she
waited
for
more
is
the
impulse
to
explain
discover
get
it
out
of
me
somehow
and
so
get
rid
of
it
not
by
writing
though
as
and
again
i
repeated
my
former
question
what
in
the
world
do
you
think
it
is
my
voice
had
become
involuntarily
hushed
there
was
awe
in
it
her
answer
given
with
slow
emphasis
brought
back
all
my
reserve
the
phraseology
provoked
me
rather
whatever
it
is
bill
it
is
not
of
i
got
up
to
go
downstairs
i
believe
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
would
you
like
to
leave
frances
shall
we
go
back
to
town
i
suggested
this
at
the
door
and
hearing
no
immediate
reply
i
turned
back
to
look
frances
was
sitting
with
her
head
bowed
over
and
buried
in
her
hands
the
attitude
horribly
suggested
tears
no
woman
i
realised
can
keep
back
the
pressure
of
strong
emotion
as
long
as
frances
had
done
without
ending
in
a
fluid
collapse
i
waited
a
moment
uneasily
longing
to
comfort
yet
afraid
to
act
and
in
this
way
discovered
the
existence
of
the
appalling
emotion
in
myself
hitherto
but
half
guessed
at
all
costs
a
scene
must
be
prevented
it
would
involve
such
exaggeration
and
brutally
such
is
the
weakness
of
the
ordinary
man
i
turned
the
handle
to
go
out
but
my
sister
then
raised
her
head
the
sunlight
caught
her
face
framed
untidily
in
its
auburn
hair
and
i
saw
her
wonderful
expression
with
a
start
pity
tenderness
and
sympathy
shone
in
it
like
a
flame
it
was
undeniable
there
shone
through
all
her
features
the
imperishable
love
and
yearning
to
sacrifice
self
for
others
which
i
have
seen
in
only
one
type
of
human
being
it
was
the
great
mother
look
we
must
stay
by
mabel
and
help
her
get
it
straight
she
whispered
making
the
decision
for
us
both
i
murmured
agreement
abashed
and
half
ashamed
i
stole
softly
from
the
room
and
went
out
into
the
grounds
and
the
first
thing
clearly
realised
when
alone
was
this
that
the
long
scene
between
us
was
without
definite
result
the
exchange
of
confidence
was
really
nothing
but
hints
and
vague
suggestion
we
had
decided
to
stay
but
it
was
a
negative
decision
not
to
leave
rather
than
a
positive
action
all
our
words
and
questions
our
guesses
inferences
explanations
our
most
subtle
allusions
and
insinuations
even
the
odious
paintings
themselves
were
without
definite
result
nothing
had
happened
vi
and
instinctively
once
alone
i
made
for
the
places
where
she
had
painted
her
extraordinary
pictures
i
tried
to
see
what
she
had
seen
perhaps
now
that
she
had
opened
my
mind
to
another
view
i
should
be
sensitive
to
some
similar
interpretation
and
possibly
by
way
of
literary
expression
if
i
were
to
write
about
the
place
i
asked
myself
how
should
i
treat
it
i
deliberately
invited
an
interpretation
in
the
way
that
came
easiest
to
me
writing
but
in
this
case
there
came
no
such
revelation
looking
closely
at
the
trees
and
flowers
the
bits
of
lawn
and
terrace
the
and
corner
of
the
house
where
the
flaming
creeper
hung
so
thickly
i
discovered
nothing
of
the
odious
unpure
thing
her
colour
and
grouping
had
unconsciously
revealed
at
first
that
is
i
discovered
nothing
the
reality
stood
there
commonplace
and
ugly
side
by
side
with
her
distorted
version
of
it
that
lay
in
my
mind
it
seemed
incredible
i
tried
to
force
it
but
in
vain
my
imagination
ploughed
less
deeply
than
hers
or
to
another
pattern
grew
different
seed
where
i
saw
the
gross
soul
of
an
overgrown
suburban
garden
inspired
by
the
spirit
of
a
vulgar
rich
revivalist
who
loved
to
preach
damnation
she
saw
this
rush
of
pagan
liberty
and
joy
this
strange
licence
of
primitive
flesh
which
tainted
by
the
other
produced
the
adulterated
vile
result
certain
things
however
gradually
then
became
apparent
forcing
themselves
upon
me
willy
nilly
they
came
slowly
but
overwhelmingly
not
that
facts
had
changed
or
natural
details
altered
in
the
grounds
this
was
impossible
but
that
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
various
aspects
i
had
not
noticed
before
trivial
enough
yet
for
me
just
then
significant
some
i
remembered
from
previous
days
others
i
saw
now
as
i
wandered
to
and
fro
uneasy
uncomfortable
almost
it
seemed
watched
by
some
one
who
took
note
of
my
impressions
the
details
were
so
foolish
the
total
result
so
formidable
i
was
half
aware
that
others
tried
hard
to
make
me
see
it
was
deliberate
my
sister
s
phrase
one
layer
got
at
me
another
gets
at
you
flashed
undesired
upon
me
for
i
saw
as
with
the
eyes
of
a
child
what
i
can
only
call
a
goblin
garden
house
grounds
trees
and
flowers
belonged
to
a
goblin
world
that
children
enter
through
the
pages
of
their
fairy
tales
and
what
made
me
first
aware
of
it
was
the
whisper
of
the
wind
behind
me
so
that
i
turned
with
a
sudden
start
feeling
that
something
had
moved
closer
an
old
ash
tree
ugly
and
ungainly
had
been
artificially
trained
to
form
an
arbour
at
one
end
of
the
terrace
that
was
a
tennis
lawn
and
the
leaves
of
it
now
went
rustling
together
swishing
as
they
rose
and
fell
i
looked
at
the
ash
tree
and
felt
as
though
i
had
passed
that
moment
between
doors
into
this
goblin
garden
that
crouched
behind
the
real
one
below
at
a
deeper
layer
perhaps
lay
hidden
the
one
my
sister
had
entered
to
deal
with
my
own
however
i
call
it
goblin
because
an
odd
aspect
of
the
quaint
in
it
yet
never
quite
achieved
the
picturesque
grotesque
probably
is
the
truer
word
for
everywhere
i
noticed
and
for
the
first
time
this
slight
alteration
of
the
natural
due
either
to
the
exaggeration
of
some
detail
or
to
its
suppression
generally
i
think
to
the
latter
life
everywhere
appeared
to
me
as
blocked
from
the
full
delivery
of
its
sweet
and
lovely
message
some
counter
influence
stopped
it
suppression
or
sent
it
awry
exaggeration
the
house
itself
mere
expression
of
course
of
a
narrow
limited
mind
was
sheer
ugliness
it
required
no
further
explanation
with
the
grounds
and
garden
so
far
as
shape
and
general
plan
were
concerned
this
was
also
true
but
that
trees
and
flowers
and
other
natural
details
should
share
the
same
deficiency
perplexed
my
logical
soul
and
even
dismayed
it
i
stood
and
stared
then
moved
about
and
stood
and
stared
again
everywhere
was
this
mockery
of
a
sinister
unfinished
aspect
i
sought
in
vain
to
recover
my
normal
point
of
view
my
mind
had
found
this
goblin
garden
and
wandered
to
and
fro
in
it
unable
to
escape
the
change
was
in
myself
of
course
and
so
trivial
were
the
details
which
illustrated
it
that
they
sound
absurd
thus
mentioned
one
by
one
for
me
they
proved
it
is
all
i
can
affirm
the
goblin
touch
lay
plainly
everywhere
in
the
forms
of
the
trees
planted
at
neat
intervals
along
the
lawns
in
this
twisted
ash
that
rustled
just
behind
me
in
the
shadow
of
the
gloomy
wellingtonias
whose
sweeping
skirts
obscured
the
grass
but
especially
i
noticed
in
the
tops
and
crests
of
them
for
here
the
delicate
graceful
curves
of
last
year
s
growth
seemed
to
shrink
back
into
themselves
none
of
them
pointed
upwards
their
life
had
failed
and
turned
aside
just
when
it
should
have
become
triumphant
the
character
of
a
tree
reveals
itself
chiefly
at
the
extremities
and
it
was
precisely
here
that
they
all
drooped
and
achieved
this
hint
of
goblin
distortion
in
the
growth
that
is
of
the
last
few
years
what
ought
to
have
been
fairy
joyful
natural
was
instead
uncomely
to
the
verge
of
the
grotesque
spontaneous
expression
was
arrested
my
mind
perceived
a
goblin
garden
and
was
caught
in
it
the
place
grimaced
at
me
with
the
flowers
it
was
similar
though
far
more
difficult
to
detect
in
detail
for
description
i
saw
the
smaller
vegetable
growth
as
impish
even
the
terraces
sloped
ill
as
though
their
ends
had
sagged
since
they
had
been
so
lavishly
constructed
their
varying
angles
gave
a
queerly
bewildering
aspect
to
their
sequence
that
was
unpleasant
to
the
eye
one
might
wander
among
their
deceptive
lengths
and
get
lost
lost
among
open
terraces
with
the
house
quite
close
at
hand
unhomely
seemed
the
entire
garden
unable
to
give
repose
restlessness
in
it
everywhere
almost
strife
and
discord
certainly
moreover
the
garden
grew
into
the
house
the
house
into
the
garden
and
in
both
was
this
idea
of
resistance
to
the
natural
the
spirit
that
says
no
to
joy
all
over
it
i
was
aware
of
the
effort
to
achieve
another
end
the
struggle
to
burst
forth
and
escape
into
free
spontaneous
expression
that
should
be
happy
and
natural
yet
the
effort
for
ever
frustrated
by
the
weight
of
this
dark
shadow
that
rendered
it
abortive
life
crawled
aside
into
a
channel
that
was
a
then
turned
horribly
upon
itself
instead
of
blossom
and
fruit
there
were
weeds
this
approach
of
life
i
was
conscious
of
then
dismal
failure
there
was
no
fulfilment
nothing
happened
and
so
through
this
singular
mood
i
came
a
little
nearer
to
understand
the
unpure
thing
that
had
stammered
out
into
expression
through
my
sister
s
talent
for
the
unpure
is
merely
negative
it
has
no
existence
it
is
but
the
cramped
expression
of
what
is
true
stammering
its
way
brokenly
over
false
boundaries
that
seek
to
limit
and
confine
great
full
expression
of
anything
is
pure
whereas
here
was
only
the
incomplete
unfinished
and
therefore
ugly
there
was
strife
and
pain
and
desire
to
escape
i
found
myself
shrinking
from
house
and
grounds
as
one
shrinks
from
the
touch
of
the
mentally
arrested
those
in
whom
life
has
turned
awry
there
was
almost
mutilation
in
it
past
items
too
now
flocked
to
confirm
this
feeling
that
i
walked
liberty
captured
and
in
a
monstrous
garden
i
remembered
days
of
rain
that
refreshed
the
countryside
but
left
these
grounds
cracked
with
the
summer
heat
unsatisfied
and
thirsty
and
how
the
big
winds
that
cleaned
the
woods
and
fields
elsewhere
crawled
here
with
difficulty
through
the
dense
foliage
that
protected
the
towers
from
the
north
and
west
and
east
they
were
ineffective
sluggish
currents
there
was
no
real
wind
nothing
happened
i
began
to
realise
far
more
clearly
than
in
my
sister
s
fanciful
explanation
about
layers
that
here
were
many
contrary
influences
at
work
mutually
destructive
of
one
another
house
and
grounds
were
not
haunted
merely
they
were
the
arena
of
past
thinking
and
feeling
perhaps
of
terrible
impure
beliefs
each
striving
to
suppress
the
others
yet
no
one
of
them
achieving
supremacy
because
no
one
of
them
was
strong
enough
no
one
of
them
was
true
each
moreover
tried
to
win
me
over
though
only
one
was
able
to
reach
my
mind
at
all
for
some
obscure
reason
possibly
because
my
temperament
had
a
natural
bias
towards
the
grotesque
it
was
the
goblin
layer
with
me
it
was
the
line
of
least
resistance
in
my
own
thoughts
this
goblin
garden
revealed
of
course
merely
my
personal
interpretation
i
felt
now
objectively
what
long
ago
my
mind
had
felt
subjectively
my
work
essential
sign
of
spontaneous
life
with
me
had
stopped
dead
production
had
become
impossible
i
stood
now
considerably
closer
to
the
cause
of
this
sterility
the
cause
rather
turned
bolder
had
stepped
insolently
nearer
nothing
happened
anywhere
house
garden
mind
alike
were
barren
abortive
torn
by
the
strife
of
frustrate
impulse
ugly
hateful
sinful
yet
behind
it
all
was
still
the
desire
of
life
desire
to
escape
accomplish
hope
an
intolerable
hope
i
became
startlingly
aware
crowned
torture
and
realising
this
though
in
some
part
of
me
where
reason
lost
her
hold
there
rose
upon
me
then
another
and
a
darker
thing
that
caught
me
by
the
throat
and
made
me
shrink
with
a
sense
of
revulsion
that
touched
actual
loathing
i
knew
instantly
whence
it
came
this
wave
of
abhorrence
and
disgust
for
even
while
i
saw
red
and
felt
revolt
rise
in
me
it
seemed
that
i
grew
partially
aware
of
the
layer
next
below
the
goblin
i
perceived
the
existence
of
this
deeper
stratum
one
opened
the
way
for
the
other
as
it
were
there
were
so
many
yet
all
to
admit
one
was
to
clear
the
way
for
all
if
i
lingered
i
should
be
caught
horribly
they
struggled
with
such
violence
for
supremacy
among
themselves
however
that
this
latest
uprising
was
instantly
smothered
and
crushed
back
though
not
before
a
glimpse
had
been
revealed
to
me
and
the
redness
in
my
thoughts
transferred
itself
to
colour
my
surroundings
thickly
and
appallingly
with
blood
this
lurid
aspect
drenched
the
garden
smeared
the
terraces
lent
to
the
very
soil
a
tinge
as
of
sacrificial
rites
that
choked
the
breath
in
me
while
it
seemed
to
fix
me
to
the
earth
my
feet
so
longed
to
leave
it
was
so
revolting
that
at
the
same
time
i
felt
a
dreadful
curiosity
as
of
fascination
i
wished
to
stay
between
these
contrary
impulses
i
think
i
actually
reeled
a
moment
transfixed
by
a
fascination
of
the
awful
through
the
lighter
goblin
veil
i
felt
myself
sinking
down
down
down
into
this
turgid
layer
that
was
so
much
more
violent
and
so
much
more
ancient
the
upper
layer
indeed
seemed
fairy
by
comparison
with
this
terror
born
of
the
lust
for
blood
thick
with
the
anguish
of
human
sacrificial
victims
then
i
was
already
sinking
my
feet
were
caught
i
was
actually
in
it
what
atavistic
strain
hidden
deep
within
me
had
been
touched
into
vile
response
giving
this
flash
of
intuitive
comprehension
i
can
not
say
the
coatings
laid
on
by
civilisation
are
probably
thin
enough
in
all
of
us
i
made
a
supreme
effort
the
sun
and
wind
came
back
i
could
almost
swear
i
opened
my
eyes
something
very
atrocious
surged
back
into
the
depths
carrying
with
it
a
thought
of
tangled
woods
of
big
stones
standing
in
a
circle
motionless
white
figures
the
one
form
bound
with
ropes
and
the
ghastly
gleam
of
the
knife
like
smoke
upon
a
battlefield
it
rolled
away
i
was
standing
on
the
gravel
path
below
the
second
terrace
when
the
familiar
goblin
garden
danced
back
again
doubly
grotesque
now
doubly
mocking
yet
by
way
of
contrast
almost
welcome
my
glimpse
into
the
depths
was
momentary
it
seems
and
had
passed
utterly
away
the
common
world
rushed
back
with
a
sense
of
glad
relief
yet
ominous
now
for
ever
i
felt
for
the
knowledge
of
what
its
past
had
built
upon
in
street
in
theatre
in
the
festivities
of
friends
in
or
even
indeed
in
church
how
could
the
memory
of
what
i
had
seen
and
felt
not
leave
its
hideous
trace
the
very
structure
of
my
thought
it
seemed
to
me
was
stained
what
has
been
thought
by
others
can
never
be
obliterated
until
with
a
start
my
reverie
broke
and
fled
scattered
by
a
violent
sound
that
i
recognised
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
as
wholly
desirable
the
returning
motor
meant
that
my
hostess
was
back
yet
so
urgent
had
been
my
temporary
obsession
that
my
first
presentation
of
her
was
well
not
as
i
knew
her
now
floating
along
with
a
face
of
anguished
torture
i
saw
mabel
a
mere
effigy
captured
by
others
thinking
pass
down
into
those
depths
of
fire
and
blood
that
only
just
had
closed
beneath
my
feet
she
dipped
away
she
vanished
her
fading
eyes
turned
to
the
last
towards
some
saviour
who
had
failed
her
and
that
strange
intolerable
hope
was
in
her
face
the
mystery
of
the
place
was
pretty
thick
about
me
just
then
it
was
the
fall
of
dusk
and
the
ghost
of
slanting
sunshine
was
as
unreal
as
though
badly
painted
the
garden
stood
at
attention
all
about
me
i
can
not
explain
it
but
i
can
tell
it
i
think
exactly
as
it
happened
for
it
remains
vivid
in
me
for
ever
that
for
the
first
time
something
myself
apparently
the
combining
link
through
which
it
pressed
towards
delivery
i
had
already
turned
towards
the
house
in
my
mind
were
pictures
not
actual
thoughts
of
the
motor
tea
on
the
verandah
my
sister
mabel
when
there
came
behind
me
this
tumultuous
awful
rush
as
i
left
the
garden
the
ugliness
the
pain
the
striving
to
escape
the
whole
negative
and
suppressed
agony
that
the
place
focused
that
second
into
a
concentrated
effort
to
produce
a
result
it
was
a
blinding
tempest
of
desire
that
heaved
at
me
surging
appallingly
behind
me
like
an
anguished
mob
i
was
in
the
act
of
crossing
the
frontier
into
my
normal
self
again
when
it
came
catching
fearfully
at
my
skirts
i
might
use
an
entire
dictionary
of
descriptive
adjectives
yet
come
no
nearer
to
it
than
this
the
conception
of
a
huge
assemblage
determined
to
escape
with
me
or
to
snatch
me
back
among
themselves
my
legs
trembled
for
an
instant
and
i
caught
my
breath
then
turned
and
ran
as
fast
as
possible
up
the
ugly
terraces
at
the
same
instant
as
though
the
clanging
of
an
iron
gate
cut
short
the
unfinished
phrase
i
the
beginning
of
an
awful
thing
the
damned
like
this
it
rushed
after
me
from
that
goblin
garden
that
had
sought
to
keep
me
the
damned
for
there
was
sound
in
it
i
know
full
well
it
was
subjective
not
actually
heard
at
all
yet
somehow
sound
was
in
it
a
great
volume
roaring
and
booming
thunderously
far
away
and
below
me
the
sentence
dipped
back
into
the
depths
that
gave
it
birth
unfinished
its
completion
was
prevented
as
usual
nothing
happened
but
it
drove
behind
me
like
a
hurricane
as
i
ran
towards
the
house
and
the
sound
of
it
i
can
only
liken
to
those
terrible
undertones
you
may
hear
standing
beside
niagara
they
lie
behind
the
mere
crash
of
the
falling
flood
within
it
somehow
not
audible
to
all
felt
rather
than
definitely
heard
it
seemed
to
echo
back
from
the
surface
of
those
sagging
terraces
as
i
flew
across
their
sloping
ends
for
it
was
somehow
underneath
them
it
was
in
the
rustle
of
the
wind
that
stirred
the
skirts
of
the
drooping
wellingtonias
the
beds
of
formal
flowers
passed
it
on
to
the
creepers
red
as
blood
that
crept
over
the
unsightly
building
into
the
structure
of
the
vulgar
and
forbidding
house
it
sank
away
the
towers
took
it
home
the
uncomely
doors
and
windows
seemed
almost
like
mouths
that
had
uttered
the
words
themselves
and
on
the
upper
floors
at
that
very
moment
i
saw
two
maids
in
the
act
of
closing
them
again
and
on
the
verandah
as
i
arrived
breathless
and
shaken
in
my
soul
frances
and
mabel
standing
by
the
looked
up
to
greet
me
in
the
faces
of
both
were
clearly
legible
the
signs
of
shock
they
watched
me
coming
yet
so
full
of
their
own
distress
that
they
hardly
noticed
the
state
in
which
i
came
in
the
face
of
my
hostess
however
i
read
another
and
a
bigger
thing
than
in
the
face
of
frances
mabel
she
had
experienced
what
i
had
experienced
she
had
heard
that
awful
sentence
i
had
heard
but
heard
it
not
for
the
first
time
heard
it
moreover
i
verily
believe
complete
and
to
its
dreadful
end
bill
did
you
hear
that
curious
noise
just
now
frances
asked
it
sharply
before
i
could
say
a
word
her
manner
was
confused
she
looked
straight
at
me
and
there
was
a
tremor
in
her
voice
she
could
not
hide
there
s
wind
about
i
said
wind
in
the
trees
and
sweeping
round
the
walls
it
s
risen
rather
my
voice
faltered
rather
no
it
wasn
t
wind
she
insisted
with
a
significance
meant
for
me
alone
but
badly
hidden
it
was
more
like
distant
thunder
we
thought
how
you
ran
too
she
added
what
a
pace
you
came
across
the
terraces
i
knew
instantly
from
the
way
she
said
it
that
they
both
had
already
heard
the
sound
before
and
were
anxious
to
know
if
i
had
heard
it
and
how
my
interpretation
was
what
they
sought
it
was
a
curiously
deep
sound
i
admit
it
may
have
been
big
guns
at
sea
i
suggested
forts
or
cruisers
practising
the
coast
isn
t
so
very
far
and
with
the
wind
in
the
right
direction
the
expression
on
mabel
s
face
stopped
me
dead
like
huge
doors
closing
she
said
softly
in
her
colourless
voice
enormous
metal
doors
shutting
against
a
mass
of
people
clamouring
to
get
the
gravity
the
note
of
hopelessness
in
her
tones
was
shocking
frances
had
gone
into
the
house
the
instant
mabel
began
to
speak
i
m
cold
she
had
said
i
think
i
ll
get
a
mabel
and
i
were
alone
i
believe
it
was
the
first
time
we
had
been
really
alone
since
i
arrived
she
looked
up
from
the
teacups
fixing
her
pallid
eyes
on
mine
she
had
made
a
question
of
the
sentence
you
hear
it
like
that
i
asked
innocently
i
purposely
used
the
present
tense
she
changed
her
stare
from
one
eye
to
the
other
it
was
absolutely
expressionless
my
sister
s
step
sounded
on
the
floor
of
the
room
behind
us
if
only
mabel
began
then
stopped
and
my
own
feelings
leaping
out
instinctively
completed
the
sentence
i
felt
was
in
her
mind
something
would
she
instantly
corrected
me
i
had
caught
her
thought
yet
somehow
phrased
it
wrongly
we
could
escape
she
lowered
her
tone
a
little
saying
it
hurriedly
the
we
amazed
and
horrified
me
but
something
in
her
voice
and
manner
struck
me
utterly
dumb
there
was
ice
and
terror
in
it
it
was
a
dying
woman
speaking
a
lost
and
hopeless
soul
in
that
atrocious
moment
i
hardly
noticed
what
was
said
exactly
but
i
remember
that
my
sister
returned
with
a
grey
shawl
about
her
shoulders
and
that
mabel
said
in
her
ordinary
voice
again
it
chilly
yes
let
s
have
tea
inside
and
that
two
maids
one
of
them
the
grenadier
speedily
carried
the
loaded
trays
into
the
and
put
a
match
to
the
logs
in
the
great
open
fireplace
it
was
after
all
foolish
to
risk
the
sharp
evening
air
for
dusk
was
falling
steadily
and
even
the
sunshine
of
the
day
just
fading
could
not
turn
autumn
into
summer
i
was
the
last
to
come
in
just
as
i
left
the
verandah
a
large
black
bird
swooped
down
in
front
of
me
past
the
pillars
it
dropped
from
overhead
swerved
abruptly
to
one
side
as
it
caught
sight
of
me
and
flapped
heavily
towards
the
shrubberies
on
the
left
of
the
terraces
where
it
disappeared
into
the
gloom
it
flew
very
low
very
close
and
it
startled
me
i
think
because
in
some
way
it
seemed
like
my
shadow
materialised
as
though
the
dark
horror
that
was
rising
everywhere
from
house
and
garden
then
settling
back
so
thickly
yet
so
imperceptibly
upon
us
all
were
incarnated
in
that
whirring
creature
that
passed
between
the
daylight
and
the
coming
night
i
stood
a
moment
wondering
if
it
would
appear
again
before
i
followed
the
others
indoors
and
as
i
was
in
the
act
of
closing
the
windows
after
me
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
figure
on
the
lawn
it
was
some
distance
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
shrubberies
in
fact
where
the
bird
had
vanished
but
in
spite
of
the
twilight
that
half
magnified
half
obscured
it
the
identity
was
unmistakable
i
knew
the
housekeeper
s
stiff
walk
too
well
to
be
deceived
mrs
marsh
taking
the
air
i
said
to
myself
i
felt
the
necessity
of
saying
it
and
i
wondered
why
she
was
doing
so
at
this
particular
hour
if
i
had
other
thoughts
they
were
so
vague
and
so
quickly
and
utterly
suppressed
that
i
can
not
recall
them
sufficiently
to
relate
them
here
and
once
indoors
it
was
to
be
expected
that
there
would
come
explanation
discussion
conversation
at
any
rate
regarding
the
singular
noise
and
its
cause
some
uttered
evidence
of
the
mood
that
had
been
strong
enough
to
drive
us
all
inside
yet
there
was
none
each
of
us
purposely
and
with
various
skill
ignored
it
we
talked
little
and
when
we
did
it
was
of
anything
in
the
world
but
that
personally
i
experienced
a
touch
of
that
same
bewilderment
which
had
come
over
me
during
my
first
talk
with
frances
on
the
evening
of
my
arrival
for
i
recall
now
the
acute
tension
and
the
hope
yet
dread
that
one
or
other
of
us
must
sooner
or
later
introduce
the
subject
it
did
not
happen
however
no
reference
was
made
to
it
even
remotely
it
was
the
presence
of
mabel
i
felt
positive
that
prohibited
as
soon
might
we
have
discussed
death
in
the
bedroom
of
a
dying
woman
the
only
scrap
of
conversation
i
remember
where
all
was
ordinary
and
commonplace
was
when
mabel
spoke
casually
to
the
grenadier
asking
why
marsh
had
omitted
to
do
something
or
other
what
it
was
i
forget
and
that
the
maid
replied
respectfully
that
mrs
marsh
was
very
sorry
but
her
and
still
pained
i
enquired
though
so
casually
that
i
scarcely
know
what
prompted
the
words
whether
she
had
injured
herself
severely
and
the
reply
she
upset
a
lamp
and
burnt
herself
was
said
in
a
tone
that
made
me
feel
my
curiosity
was
indiscreet
but
she
always
has
an
excuse
for
not
doing
things
she
ought
to
the
little
bit
of
conversation
remained
with
me
and
i
remember
particularly
the
quick
way
frances
interrupted
and
turned
the
talk
upon
the
delinquencies
of
servants
in
general
telling
incidents
of
her
own
at
our
flat
with
a
volubility
that
perhaps
seemed
forced
and
that
certainly
did
not
encourage
general
talk
as
it
may
have
been
intended
to
do
we
lapsed
into
silence
immediately
she
finished
but
for
all
our
care
and
all
our
calculated
silence
each
knew
that
something
had
in
these
last
moments
come
very
close
it
had
brushed
us
in
passing
it
had
retired
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
now
that
the
large
dark
thing
i
saw
riding
the
dusk
probably
bird
of
prey
was
in
some
sense
a
symbol
of
it
in
my
mind
that
actually
there
had
been
no
bird
at
all
i
mean
but
that
my
mood
of
apprehension
and
dismay
had
formed
the
vivid
picture
in
my
thoughts
it
had
swept
past
us
it
had
retreated
but
it
was
now
at
this
moment
in
hiding
very
close
and
it
was
watching
us
perhaps
too
it
was
mere
coincidence
that
i
encountered
marsh
housekeeper
several
times
that
evening
in
the
short
interval
between
tea
and
dinner
and
that
on
each
occasion
the
sight
of
this
gaunt
woman
fed
my
prejudice
against
her
once
on
my
way
to
the
telephone
i
ran
into
her
just
where
the
passage
is
somewhat
jammed
by
a
square
table
carrying
the
chinese
gong
a
grandfather
s
clock
and
a
box
of
croquet
mallets
we
both
gave
way
then
both
advanced
then
again
gave
way
simultaneously
it
seemed
impossible
to
pass
we
stepped
with
decision
to
the
same
side
finally
colliding
in
the
middle
while
saying
those
futile
little
things
half
apology
half
excuse
that
are
inevitable
at
such
times
in
the
end
she
stood
upright
against
the
wall
for
me
to
pass
taking
her
place
against
the
very
door
i
wished
to
open
it
was
ludicrous
excuse
me
i
was
just
going
in
to
telephone
i
explained
and
she
sidled
off
murmuring
apologies
but
opening
the
door
for
me
while
she
did
so
our
hands
met
a
moment
on
the
handle
there
was
a
second
s
awkwardness
it
was
so
stupid
i
remembered
her
injury
and
by
way
of
something
to
say
i
enquired
after
it
she
thanked
me
it
was
entirely
healed
now
but
it
might
have
been
much
worse
and
there
was
something
about
the
mercy
of
the
lord
that
i
didn
t
quite
catch
while
telephoning
however
a
london
call
and
my
attention
focused
on
it
i
realised
sharply
that
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
spoken
with
her
also
that
i
had
touched
her
it
happened
to
be
a
sunday
and
the
lines
were
clear
i
got
my
connection
quickly
and
the
incident
was
forgotten
while
my
thoughts
went
up
to
london
on
my
way
upstairs
then
the
woman
came
back
into
my
mind
so
that
i
recalled
other
things
about
her
how
she
seemed
all
over
the
house
in
unlikely
places
often
how
i
had
caught
her
sitting
in
the
hall
alone
that
night
how
she
was
for
ever
coming
and
going
with
her
lugubrious
visage
and
that
untidy
hair
at
the
back
that
had
made
me
laugh
three
years
ago
with
the
idea
that
it
looked
singed
or
burnt
and
how
the
impression
on
my
first
arrival
at
the
towers
was
that
this
woman
somehow
kept
alive
though
its
evidence
was
outwardly
suppressed
the
influence
of
her
late
employer
and
of
his
sombre
teachings
somewhere
with
her
was
associated
the
idea
of
punishment
vindictiveness
revenge
i
remembered
again
suddenly
my
odd
notion
that
she
sought
to
keep
her
present
mistress
here
a
prisoner
in
this
bleak
and
comfortless
house
and
that
really
in
spite
of
her
obsequious
silence
she
was
intensely
opposed
to
the
change
of
thought
that
had
reclaimed
mabel
to
a
happier
view
of
life
all
this
in
a
passing
second
flashed
in
review
before
me
and
i
discovered
or
at
any
rate
reconstructed
the
real
marsh
she
was
decidedly
in
the
shadow
more
she
stood
in
the
forefront
of
it
stealthily
leading
an
assault
as
it
were
against
the
towers
and
its
occupants
as
though
consciously
or
unconsciously
she
laboured
incessantly
to
this
hateful
end
i
can
only
judge
that
some
state
of
nervousness
in
me
permitted
the
series
of
insignificant
thoughts
to
assume
this
dramatic
shape
and
that
what
had
gone
before
prepared
the
way
and
led
her
up
at
the
head
of
so
formidable
a
procession
i
relate
it
exactly
as
it
came
to
me
my
nerves
were
doubtless
somewhat
on
edge
by
now
otherwise
i
should
hardly
have
been
a
prey
to
the
exaggeration
at
all
i
seemed
open
to
so
many
strange
impressions
nothing
else
perhaps
can
explain
my
ridiculous
conversation
with
her
when
for
the
third
time
that
evening
i
came
suddenly
upon
the
woman
down
the
stairs
standing
by
an
open
window
as
if
in
the
act
of
listening
she
was
dressed
in
black
a
black
shawl
over
her
square
shoulders
and
black
gloves
on
her
big
broad
hands
two
black
objects
apparently
she
clasped
and
on
her
head
she
wore
a
bonnet
with
shaking
beads
of
jet
at
first
i
did
not
know
her
as
i
came
running
down
upon
her
from
the
landing
it
was
only
when
she
stood
aside
to
let
me
pass
that
i
saw
her
profile
against
the
tapestry
and
recognised
marsh
and
to
catch
her
on
the
front
stairs
dressed
like
this
struck
me
as
incongruous
impertinent
i
paused
in
my
dangerous
descent
through
the
opened
window
came
the
sound
of
bells
church
bells
a
sound
more
depressing
to
me
than
superstition
and
as
nauseating
though
the
action
was
i
obeyed
the
sudden
prompting
was
it
a
secret
desire
to
attack
perhaps
and
spoke
to
her
been
to
church
i
suppose
marsh
i
said
or
just
going
perhaps
her
face
as
she
looked
up
a
second
to
reply
was
like
an
iron
doll
that
moved
its
lips
and
turned
its
eyes
but
made
no
other
imitation
of
life
at
all
some
of
us
still
goes
sir
she
said
unctuously
it
was
respectful
enough
yet
the
implied
judgment
of
the
rest
of
the
world
made
me
almost
angry
a
deferential
insolence
lay
behind
the
affected
meekness
for
those
who
believe
no
doubt
it
helpful
i
smiled
true
religion
brings
peace
and
happiness
i
m
sure
joy
marsh
joy
i
found
keen
satisfaction
in
the
emphasis
she
looked
at
me
like
a
knife
i
can
not
describe
the
implacable
thing
that
shone
in
her
fixed
stern
eyes
nor
the
shadow
of
felt
darkness
that
stole
across
her
face
she
glittered
i
felt
hate
in
her
i
knew
she
knew
too
who
was
in
the
thoughts
of
us
both
at
that
moment
she
replied
softly
never
forgetting
her
place
for
an
instant
there
is
joy
sir
in
eaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
and
in
church
there
goes
up
prayer
to
gawd
for
those
oo
well
for
the
others
sir
oo
she
cut
short
her
sentence
thus
the
gloom
about
her
as
she
said
it
was
like
the
gloom
about
a
hearse
a
tomb
a
darkness
of
great
hopeless
dungeons
my
tongue
ran
on
of
itself
with
a
kind
of
bitter
satisfaction
we
must
believe
there
are
others
marsh
salvation
you
know
would
be
such
a
failure
if
there
were
no
merciful
god
could
ever
have
devised
such
a
fearful
plan
her
voice
interrupting
me
seemed
to
rise
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
earth
they
rejected
the
salvation
when
it
was
hoffered
to
them
sir
on
but
you
wouldn
t
have
them
tortured
for
ever
because
of
one
mistake
in
ignorance
i
said
fixing
her
with
my
eye
come
now
would
you
marsh
no
god
worth
worshipping
could
permit
such
cruelty
think
a
moment
what
it
she
stared
at
me
a
curious
expression
in
her
stupid
eyes
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
the
woman
in
her
revolted
while
yet
she
dared
not
suffer
her
grim
belief
to
trip
that
is
she
would
willingly
have
had
it
otherwise
but
for
a
terror
that
prevented
we
may
pray
for
them
sir
and
we
do
we
she
dropped
her
eyes
to
the
carpet
good
good
i
put
in
cheerfully
sorry
now
that
i
had
spoken
at
all
that
s
more
hopeful
at
any
rate
isn
t
it
she
murmured
something
about
abraham
s
bosom
and
the
time
of
salvation
not
being
for
ever
as
i
tried
to
pass
her
then
a
half
gesture
that
she
made
stopped
me
there
was
something
more
she
wished
to
say
to
ask
she
looked
up
furtively
in
her
eyes
i
saw
the
woman
peering
out
through
fear
per
aps
sir
she
faltered
as
though
lightning
must
strike
her
dead
per
aps
would
you
think
a
drop
of
cold
water
given
in
his
name
might
moisten
but
i
stopped
her
for
the
foolish
talk
had
lasted
long
enough
of
course
i
exclaimed
of
course
for
god
is
love
remember
and
love
means
charity
tolerance
sympathy
and
sparing
others
pain
and
i
hurried
past
her
determined
to
end
the
outrageous
conversation
for
which
yet
i
knew
myself
entirely
to
blame
behind
me
she
stood
for
several
minutes
half
bewildered
half
alarmed
as
i
suspected
i
caught
the
fragment
of
another
sentence
one
word
of
it
rather
punishment
but
the
rest
escaped
me
her
arrogance
and
condescending
tolerance
exasperated
me
while
i
was
at
the
same
time
secretly
pleased
that
i
might
have
touched
some
string
of
remorse
or
sympathy
in
her
after
all
her
belief
was
iron
she
dared
not
let
it
go
yet
somewhere
underneath
there
lurked
the
germ
of
a
wholesome
revulsion
she
would
help
them
if
she
dared
her
question
proved
it
half
ashamed
of
myself
i
turned
and
crossed
the
hall
quickly
lest
i
should
be
tempted
to
say
more
and
in
me
was
a
disagreeable
sensation
as
though
i
had
just
left
the
incurable
ward
of
some
great
hospital
a
reaction
caught
me
as
of
nausea
ugh
i
wanted
such
people
cleansed
by
fire
they
seemed
to
me
as
centres
of
contamination
whose
vicious
thoughts
flowed
out
to
stain
god
s
glorious
world
i
saw
myself
frances
mabel
too
especially
on
the
rack
while
that
odious
figure
of
cruelty
and
darkness
stood
over
us
and
ordered
the
awful
handles
turned
in
order
that
we
might
be
saved
forced
that
is
to
think
and
believe
exactly
as
thought
and
believed
i
found
relief
for
my
somewhat
childish
indignation
by
letting
myself
loose
upon
the
organ
then
the
flood
of
bach
and
beethoven
brought
back
the
sense
of
proportion
it
proved
however
at
the
same
time
that
there
been
this
growth
of
distortion
in
me
and
that
it
had
been
provided
apparently
by
my
closer
contact
for
the
first
time
with
that
funereal
personality
the
woman
who
like
her
master
believed
that
all
holding
views
of
god
that
differed
from
her
own
must
be
damned
eternally
it
gave
me
moreover
some
faint
clue
perhaps
though
a
clue
i
was
unequal
to
following
up
to
the
nature
of
the
strife
and
terror
and
frustrate
influence
in
the
house
that
housekeeper
had
to
do
with
it
she
kept
it
alive
her
thought
was
like
a
spell
she
waved
above
her
mistress
s
head
vii
that
night
i
was
wakened
by
a
hurried
tapping
at
my
door
and
before
i
could
answer
frances
stood
beside
my
bed
she
had
switched
on
the
light
as
she
came
in
her
hair
fell
straggling
over
her
her
face
was
deathly
pale
its
expression
so
distraught
it
was
almost
haggard
the
eyes
were
very
wide
she
looked
almost
like
another
woman
she
was
whispering
at
a
great
pace
bill
bill
wake
up
quick
i
awake
what
is
it
i
whispered
too
i
was
startled
listen
was
all
she
said
her
eyes
stared
into
vacancy
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
great
house
the
wind
had
dropped
and
all
was
still
only
the
tapping
seemed
to
continue
endlessly
in
my
brain
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
pointed
to
two
i
heard
nothing
frances
what
is
it
i
rubbed
my
eyes
i
had
been
very
deeply
asleep
listen
she
repeated
very
softly
holding
up
one
finger
and
turning
her
eyes
towards
the
door
she
had
left
ajar
her
usual
calmness
had
deserted
her
she
was
in
the
grip
of
some
distressing
terror
for
a
full
minute
we
held
our
breath
and
listened
then
her
eyes
rolled
round
again
and
met
my
own
and
her
skin
went
even
whiter
than
before
it
woke
me
she
said
beneath
her
breath
and
moving
a
step
nearer
to
my
bed
it
was
the
even
her
whisper
trembled
the
noise
the
word
repeated
itself
dully
of
its
own
accord
i
would
rather
it
had
been
anything
in
the
world
but
that
earthquake
foreign
cannon
collapse
of
the
house
above
our
heads
the
noise
frances
are
you
i
was
playing
really
for
a
little
time
it
was
like
thunder
at
first
i
thought
it
thunder
but
a
minute
later
it
came
again
from
underground
it
s
she
muttered
the
words
her
voice
not
properly
under
control
there
was
a
pause
of
perhaps
a
minute
and
then
we
both
spoke
at
once
we
said
foolish
obvious
things
that
neither
of
us
believed
in
for
a
second
the
roof
had
fallen
in
there
were
burglars
downstairs
the
safes
had
been
blown
open
it
was
to
comfort
each
other
as
children
do
that
we
said
these
things
also
it
was
to
gain
further
time
there
s
some
one
in
the
house
of
course
i
heard
my
voice
say
finally
as
i
sprang
out
of
bed
and
hurried
into
and
slippers
don
t
be
alarmed
i
ll
go
down
and
see
and
from
the
drawer
i
took
a
pistol
it
was
my
habit
to
carry
everywhere
with
me
i
loaded
it
carefully
while
frances
stood
beside
the
bed
and
watched
i
moved
towards
the
open
door
you
stay
here
frances
i
whispered
the
beating
of
my
heart
making
the
words
uneven
while
i
go
down
and
make
a
search
lock
yourself
in
girl
nothing
can
happen
to
you
it
was
downstairs
you
said
underneath
she
answered
faintly
pointing
through
the
floor
she
moved
suddenly
between
me
and
the
door
listen
hark
she
said
the
eyes
in
her
face
quite
fixed
it
s
coming
again
and
she
turned
her
head
to
catch
the
slightest
sound
i
stood
there
watching
her
and
while
i
watched
her
shook
but
nothing
stirred
from
the
halls
below
rose
only
the
whirr
and
quiet
ticking
of
the
numerous
clocks
the
blind
by
the
open
window
behind
us
flapped
out
a
little
into
the
room
as
the
draught
caught
it
i
ll
come
with
you
bill
to
the
next
floor
she
broke
the
silence
then
i
ll
stay
with
mabel
till
you
come
up
the
blind
sank
down
with
a
long
sigh
as
she
said
it
the
question
jumped
to
my
lips
before
i
could
repress
it
mabel
is
awake
she
heard
it
too
i
hardly
know
why
horror
caught
me
at
her
answer
all
was
so
vague
and
terrible
as
we
stood
there
playing
the
great
game
of
this
sinister
house
where
nothing
ever
happened
we
met
in
the
passage
she
was
on
her
way
to
what
shook
in
me
shook
inwardly
frances
i
mean
did
not
see
it
i
had
the
feeling
just
then
that
the
noise
was
upon
us
that
any
second
it
would
boom
and
roar
about
our
ears
but
the
deep
silence
held
i
only
heard
my
sister
s
little
whisper
coming
across
the
room
in
answer
to
my
question
then
what
is
mabel
doing
now
and
her
reply
proved
that
she
was
yielding
at
last
beneath
the
dreadful
tension
for
she
spoke
at
once
unable
longer
to
keep
up
the
pretence
with
a
kind
of
relief
as
it
were
she
said
it
out
looking
helplessly
at
me
like
a
child
she
is
weeping
and
gna
my
expression
must
have
stopped
her
i
believe
i
clapped
both
hands
upon
her
mouth
though
when
i
realised
things
clearly
again
i
found
they
were
covering
my
own
ears
instead
it
was
a
moment
of
unutterable
horror
the
revulsion
i
felt
was
actually
physical
it
would
have
given
me
pleasure
to
fire
off
all
the
five
chambers
of
my
pistol
into
the
air
above
my
head
the
sound
a
definite
wholesome
sound
that
explained
itself
would
have
been
a
positive
relief
other
feelings
though
were
in
me
too
all
over
me
rushing
to
and
fro
it
was
vain
to
seek
their
disentanglement
it
was
impossible
i
confess
that
i
experienced
among
them
a
touch
of
paralysing
fear
though
for
a
moment
only
it
passed
as
sharply
as
it
came
leaving
me
with
a
violent
flush
of
blood
to
the
face
such
as
bursts
of
anger
bring
followed
abruptly
by
an
icy
perspiration
over
the
entire
body
yet
i
may
honestly
avow
that
it
was
not
ordinary
personal
fear
i
felt
nor
any
common
dread
of
physical
injury
it
was
rather
a
vast
impersonal
shrinking
a
sympathetic
shrinking
from
the
agony
and
terror
that
countless
others
somewhere
somehow
felt
for
themselves
the
first
sensation
of
a
prison
overwhelmed
me
in
that
instant
of
bitter
strife
and
frenzied
suffering
and
the
fiery
torture
of
the
yearning
to
escape
that
was
yet
hopelessly
uttered
it
was
of
incredible
power
it
was
real
the
vain
intolerable
hope
swept
over
me
i
mastered
myself
though
hardly
knowing
how
and
took
my
sister
s
hand
it
was
as
cold
as
ice
as
i
led
her
firmly
to
the
door
and
out
into
the
passage
apparently
she
noticed
nothing
of
my
so
near
collapse
for
i
caught
her
whisper
as
we
went
you
brave
bill
splendidly
the
upper
corridors
of
the
great
sleeping
house
were
brightly
lit
on
her
way
to
me
she
had
turned
on
every
electric
switch
her
hand
could
reach
and
as
we
passed
the
final
flight
of
stairs
to
the
floor
below
i
heard
a
door
shut
softly
and
knew
that
mabel
had
been
listening
waiting
for
us
i
led
my
sister
up
to
it
she
knocked
and
the
door
was
opened
cautiously
an
inch
or
so
the
room
was
pitch
black
i
caught
no
glimpse
of
mabel
standing
there
frances
turned
to
me
with
a
hurried
whisper
billy
you
be
careful
won
t
you
and
went
in
i
just
had
time
to
answer
that
i
would
not
be
long
and
frances
to
reply
you
ll
find
us
here
when
the
door
closed
and
cut
her
sentence
short
before
its
end
but
it
was
not
alone
the
closing
door
that
took
the
final
words
frances
by
the
way
she
disappeared
i
knew
it
had
made
a
swift
and
violent
movement
into
the
darkness
that
was
as
though
she
sprang
she
leaped
upon
that
other
woman
who
stood
back
among
the
shadows
for
simultaneously
with
the
clipping
of
the
sentence
another
sound
was
also
stopped
stifled
smothered
choked
back
lest
i
should
also
hear
it
yet
not
in
time
i
heard
it
a
hard
and
horrible
sound
that
explained
both
the
leap
and
the
abrupt
cessation
of
the
whispered
words
i
stood
irresolute
a
moment
it
was
as
though
all
the
bones
had
been
withdrawn
from
my
body
so
that
i
must
sink
and
fall
that
sound
plucked
them
out
and
plucked
out
my
with
them
i
am
not
sure
that
it
was
a
sound
i
had
ever
heard
before
though
children
i
half
remembered
made
it
sometimes
in
blind
rages
when
they
knew
not
what
they
did
in
a
person
certainly
i
had
never
known
it
i
associated
it
with
animals
rather
horribly
in
the
history
of
the
world
no
doubt
it
has
been
common
enough
alas
but
fortunately
there
can
be
but
few
who
know
it
or
would
recognise
it
even
when
heard
the
bones
shot
back
into
my
body
the
same
instant
but
and
burning
the
brief
instant
of
irresolution
passed
i
was
torn
between
the
desire
to
break
down
the
door
and
enter
and
to
run
run
for
my
life
from
a
thing
i
dared
not
face
out
of
the
horrid
tumult
then
i
adopted
neither
course
without
reflection
certainly
without
analysis
of
what
was
best
to
do
for
my
sister
myself
or
mabel
i
took
up
my
action
where
it
had
been
interrupted
i
turned
from
the
awful
door
and
moved
slowly
towards
the
head
of
the
stairs
but
that
dreadful
little
sound
came
with
me
i
believe
my
own
teeth
chattered
it
seemed
all
over
the
house
in
the
empty
halls
that
opened
into
the
long
passages
towards
the
and
even
in
the
grounds
outside
the
building
from
the
lawns
and
barren
garden
from
the
ugly
terraces
themselves
it
rose
into
the
night
and
behind
it
came
a
curious
driving
sound
incomplete
unfinished
as
of
wailing
for
deliverance
the
wailing
of
desperate
souls
in
anguish
the
dull
and
dry
beseeching
of
hopeless
spirits
in
prison
that
i
could
have
taken
the
little
sound
from
the
bedroom
where
i
actually
heard
it
and
spread
it
thus
over
the
entire
house
and
grounds
is
evidence
perhaps
of
the
state
my
nerves
were
in
the
wailing
assuredly
was
in
my
mind
alone
but
the
longer
i
hesitated
the
more
difficult
became
my
task
and
gathering
up
my
lest
i
should
trip
in
the
darkness
i
passed
slowly
down
the
staircase
into
the
hall
below
i
carried
neither
candle
nor
matches
every
switch
in
room
and
corridor
was
known
to
me
the
covering
of
darkness
was
indeed
rather
comforting
than
otherwise
for
if
it
prevented
seeing
it
also
prevented
being
seen
the
heavy
pistol
knocking
against
my
thigh
as
i
moved
made
me
feel
i
was
carrying
a
child
s
toy
foolishly
i
experienced
in
every
nerve
that
primitive
vast
dread
which
is
the
thrill
of
darkness
merely
the
child
in
me
was
comforted
by
that
pistol
the
night
was
not
entirely
black
the
iron
bars
across
the
glass
front
door
were
visible
and
equally
i
discerned
the
big
stiff
wooden
chairs
in
the
hall
the
gaping
fireplace
the
upright
pillars
supporting
the
staircase
the
round
table
in
the
centre
with
its
books
and
and
the
basket
that
held
visitors
cards
there
too
was
the
stick
and
umbrella
stand
and
the
shelf
with
railway
guides
directory
and
telegraph
forms
clocks
ticked
everywhere
with
sounds
like
quiet
footfalls
light
fell
here
and
there
in
patches
from
the
floor
above
i
stood
a
moment
in
the
hall
letting
my
eyes
grow
more
accustomed
to
the
gloom
while
deciding
on
a
plan
of
search
i
made
out
the
ivy
trailing
outside
over
one
of
the
big
windows
and
then
the
tall
clock
by
the
front
door
made
a
grating
noise
deep
down
inside
its
body
it
was
the
presentation
clock
large
and
hideous
given
by
the
congregation
of
his
church
and
dreading
the
booming
strike
it
seemed
to
threaten
i
made
a
quick
decision
if
others
beside
myself
were
about
in
the
night
the
sound
of
that
striking
might
cover
their
approach
so
i
tiptoed
to
the
right
where
the
passage
led
towards
the
in
the
other
direction
were
the
and
both
little
used
and
various
other
rooms
beyond
that
had
been
generally
now
kept
locked
i
thought
of
my
sister
waiting
upstairs
with
that
frightened
woman
for
my
return
i
went
quickly
yet
stealthily
and
to
my
surprise
the
door
of
the
was
open
it
had
been
opened
i
paused
on
the
threshold
staring
about
me
i
think
i
fully
expected
to
see
a
figure
blocked
in
the
shadows
against
the
heavy
sideboard
or
looming
on
the
other
side
beneath
his
portrait
but
the
room
was
empty
i
it
empty
through
the
wide
that
gave
on
to
the
verandah
came
an
uncertain
glimmer
that
even
shone
reflected
in
the
polished
surface
of
the
and
again
i
perceived
the
stiff
outline
of
chairs
waiting
tenantless
all
round
it
two
larger
ones
with
high
carved
backs
at
either
end
the
on
the
upper
terrace
too
were
visible
outside
against
the
sky
and
the
solemn
crests
of
the
wellingtonias
on
the
terraces
below
the
enormous
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
ticked
very
slowly
as
though
its
machinery
were
running
down
and
i
made
out
the
pale
round
patch
that
was
its
face
resisting
my
first
inclination
to
turn
the
lights
up
my
hand
had
gone
so
far
as
to
finger
the
friendly
knob
i
crossed
the
room
so
carefully
that
no
single
board
creaked
nor
a
single
chair
as
i
rested
a
hand
upon
its
back
moved
on
the
parquet
flooring
i
turned
neither
to
the
right
nor
left
nor
did
i
once
look
back
i
went
towards
the
long
corridor
filled
with
priceless
d
that
led
through
various
antechambers
into
the
spacious
and
only
at
the
mouth
of
this
corridor
did
i
next
halt
a
moment
in
uncertainty
for
this
long
corridor
lit
faintly
by
high
windows
on
the
left
from
the
verandah
was
very
narrow
owing
to
the
mass
of
shelves
and
fancy
tables
it
contained
it
was
not
that
i
feared
to
knock
over
precious
things
as
i
went
but
that
because
of
its
ungenerous
width
there
would
be
no
room
to
pass
another
person
if
i
met
one
and
the
certainty
had
suddenly
come
upon
me
that
somewhere
in
this
corridor
another
person
at
this
actual
moment
stood
here
somehow
amid
all
this
dead
atmosphere
of
furniture
and
impersonal
emptiness
lay
the
hint
of
a
living
human
presence
and
with
such
conviction
did
it
come
upon
me
that
my
hand
instinctively
gripped
the
pistol
in
my
pocket
before
i
could
even
think
either
some
one
had
passed
along
this
corridor
just
before
me
or
some
one
lay
waiting
at
its
farther
end
withdrawn
or
flattened
into
one
of
the
little
recesses
to
let
me
pass
it
was
the
person
who
had
opened
the
door
and
the
blood
ran
from
my
heart
as
i
realised
it
it
was
not
courage
that
sent
me
on
but
rather
a
strong
impulsion
from
behind
that
made
it
impossible
to
retreat
the
feeling
that
a
throng
pressed
at
my
back
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
that
i
was
already
half
surrounded
swept
dragged
coaxed
into
a
vast
where
there
was
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
where
their
worm
dieth
not
and
their
fire
is
not
quenched
i
can
neither
explain
nor
justify
the
storm
of
irrational
emotion
that
swept
me
as
i
stood
in
that
moment
staring
down
the
length
of
the
silent
corridor
towards
the
at
the
far
end
i
can
only
repeat
that
no
personal
bravery
sent
me
down
it
but
that
the
negative
emotion
of
fear
was
swamped
in
this
vast
sea
of
pity
and
commiseration
for
others
that
surged
upon
me
my
senses
at
least
were
no
whit
confused
if
anything
my
brain
registered
impressions
with
keener
accuracy
than
usual
i
noticed
for
instance
that
the
two
swinging
doors
of
baize
that
cut
the
corridor
into
definite
lengths
making
little
rooms
of
the
spaces
between
them
were
both
wide
open
in
the
dim
light
no
mean
achievement
also
that
the
fronds
of
a
palm
plant
some
ten
feet
in
front
of
me
still
stirred
gently
from
the
air
of
some
one
who
had
recently
gone
past
them
the
long
green
leaves
waved
to
and
fro
like
hands
then
i
went
stealthily
forward
down
the
narrow
space
proud
even
that
i
had
this
command
of
myself
and
so
carefully
that
my
feet
made
no
sound
upon
the
japanese
matting
on
the
floor
it
was
a
journey
that
seemed
timeless
i
have
no
idea
how
fast
or
slow
i
went
but
i
remember
that
i
deliberately
examined
articles
on
each
side
of
me
peering
with
particular
closeness
into
the
recesses
of
wall
and
window
i
passed
the
first
baize
doors
and
the
passage
beyond
them
widened
out
to
hold
shelves
of
books
there
were
sofas
and
small
against
the
wall
it
narrowed
again
presently
as
i
entered
the
second
stretch
the
windows
here
were
higher
and
smaller
and
marble
statuettes
of
classical
subjects
lined
the
walls
watching
me
like
figures
of
the
dead
their
white
and
shining
faces
saw
me
yet
made
no
sign
i
passed
next
between
the
second
baize
doors
they
too
had
been
fastened
back
with
hooks
against
the
wall
thus
all
doors
were
open
had
been
recently
opened
and
so
at
length
i
found
myself
in
the
final
widening
of
the
corridor
which
formed
an
to
the
itself
it
had
been
used
formerly
to
hold
the
overflow
of
meetings
no
door
separated
it
from
the
great
hall
beyond
but
heavy
curtains
hung
usually
to
close
it
off
and
these
curtains
were
invariably
drawn
they
now
stood
wide
and
here
i
can
merely
state
the
impression
that
came
upon
me
i
knew
myself
at
last
surrounded
the
throng
that
pressed
behind
me
also
surged
in
front
facing
me
in
the
big
room
and
waiting
for
my
entry
stood
a
multitude
on
either
side
of
me
in
the
very
air
above
my
head
the
vast
assemblage
paused
upon
my
coming
the
pause
however
was
momentary
for
instantly
the
deep
tumultuous
movement
was
resumed
that
yet
was
silent
as
a
cavern
underground
i
felt
the
agony
that
was
in
it
the
passionate
striving
the
awful
struggle
to
escape
the
held
beseeching
faces
that
fought
to
press
themselves
upon
my
vision
yearning
yet
hopeless
eyes
lips
scorched
and
dry
mouths
that
opened
to
implore
but
found
no
craved
delivery
in
actual
words
and
a
fury
of
misery
and
hate
that
made
the
life
in
me
stop
dead
frozen
by
the
horror
of
vain
pity
that
intolerable
vain
hope
was
everywhere
and
the
multitude
it
came
to
me
was
not
a
single
multitude
but
many
for
as
soon
as
one
huge
division
pressed
too
close
upon
the
edge
of
escape
it
was
dragged
back
by
another
and
prevented
the
wild
host
was
divided
against
itself
here
dwelt
the
shadow
i
had
imagined
weeks
ago
and
in
it
struggled
armies
of
lost
souls
as
in
the
depths
of
some
bottomless
pit
whence
there
is
no
escape
the
layers
mingled
fighting
against
themselves
in
endless
torture
it
was
in
this
great
shadow
i
had
clairvoyantly
seen
mabel
but
about
its
fearful
mouth
i
now
was
certain
hovered
another
figure
of
darkness
a
figure
who
sought
to
keep
it
in
existence
since
to
her
thought
were
due
those
lampless
depths
of
woe
without
escape
towards
me
the
multitudes
now
surged
it
was
a
sound
and
a
movement
that
brought
me
back
into
myself
the
great
clock
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
just
then
struck
the
hour
of
three
that
was
the
sound
and
the
movement
i
was
aware
that
a
figure
was
passing
across
the
distant
centre
of
the
floor
instantly
i
dropped
back
into
the
arena
of
my
little
human
terror
my
hand
again
clutched
stupidly
at
the
pistol
butt
i
drew
back
into
the
folds
of
the
heavy
curtain
and
the
figure
advanced
i
remember
every
detail
at
first
it
seemed
to
me
enormous
this
advancing
shadow
far
beyond
human
scale
but
as
it
came
nearer
i
measured
it
though
not
consciously
by
the
organ
pipes
that
gleamed
in
faint
colours
just
above
its
gradual
soft
approach
it
passed
them
already
across
the
great
room
i
saw
then
that
its
stature
was
that
of
ordinary
men
the
prolonged
booming
of
the
clock
died
away
i
heard
the
footfall
shuffling
upon
the
polished
boards
i
heard
another
sound
a
voice
low
and
monotonous
droning
as
in
prayer
the
figure
was
speaking
it
was
a
woman
and
she
carried
in
both
hands
before
her
a
small
object
that
faintly
shimmered
a
glass
of
water
and
then
i
recognised
her
there
was
still
an
instant
s
time
before
she
reached
me
and
i
made
use
of
it
i
shrank
back
flattening
myself
against
the
wall
her
voice
ceased
a
moment
as
she
turned
and
carefully
drew
the
curtains
together
behind
her
closing
them
with
one
hand
oblivious
of
my
presence
though
she
actually
touched
my
with
the
hand
that
pulled
the
cords
she
resumed
her
dreadful
solemn
march
disappearing
at
length
down
the
long
vista
of
the
corridor
like
a
shadow
but
as
she
passed
me
her
voice
began
again
so
that
i
heard
each
word
distinctly
as
she
uttered
it
her
head
aloft
her
figure
upright
as
though
she
moved
at
the
head
of
a
procession
a
drop
of
cold
water
given
in
his
name
shall
moisten
their
burning
it
was
repeated
monotonously
over
and
over
again
droning
down
into
the
distance
as
she
went
until
at
length
both
voice
and
figure
faded
into
the
shadows
at
the
farther
end
for
a
time
i
have
no
means
of
measuring
precisely
i
stood
in
that
dark
corner
pressing
my
back
against
the
wall
and
would
have
drawn
the
curtains
down
to
hide
me
had
i
dared
to
stretch
an
arm
out
the
dread
that
presently
the
woman
would
return
passed
gradually
away
i
realised
that
the
air
had
emptied
the
crowd
her
presence
had
stirred
into
activity
had
retreated
i
was
alone
in
the
gloomy
of
the
odious
building
then
i
remembered
suddenly
again
the
terrified
women
waiting
for
me
on
that
upper
landing
and
realised
that
my
skin
was
wet
and
freezing
cold
after
a
profuse
perspiration
i
prepared
to
retrace
my
steps
i
remember
the
effort
it
cost
me
to
leave
the
support
of
the
wall
and
covering
darkness
of
my
corner
and
step
out
into
the
grey
light
of
the
corridor
at
first
i
sidled
then
finding
this
mode
of
walking
impossible
turned
my
face
boldly
and
walked
quickly
regardless
that
my
set
the
precious
objects
shaking
as
i
passed
a
wind
that
sighed
mournfully
against
the
high
small
windows
seemed
to
have
got
inside
the
corridor
as
well
it
felt
so
cold
and
every
moment
i
dreaded
to
see
the
outline
of
the
woman
s
figure
as
she
waited
in
recess
or
angle
against
the
wall
for
me
to
pass
was
there
another
thing
i
dreaded
even
more
i
can
not
say
i
only
know
that
the
first
baize
doors
had
behind
me
and
the
second
ones
were
close
at
hand
when
the
great
dim
thunder
caught
me
pouring
up
with
prodigious
volume
so
that
it
seemed
to
roll
out
from
another
world
it
shook
the
very
bowels
of
the
building
i
was
closer
to
it
than
that
other
time
when
it
had
followed
me
from
the
goblin
garden
there
was
strength
and
hardness
in
it
as
of
metal
reverberation
some
touch
of
numbness
almost
of
paralysis
must
surely
have
been
upon
me
that
i
felt
no
actual
terror
for
i
remember
even
turning
and
standing
still
to
hear
it
better
that
is
the
noise
my
thought
ran
stupidly
and
i
think
i
whispered
it
aloud
doors
are
the
wind
outside
against
the
windows
was
audible
so
it
can
not
have
been
really
loud
yet
to
me
it
was
the
biggest
deepest
sound
i
have
ever
heard
but
so
far
away
with
such
awful
remoteness
in
it
that
i
had
to
doubt
my
own
ears
at
the
same
time
it
seemed
underground
the
rumbling
of
earthquake
gates
that
shut
remorselessly
within
the
rocky
earth
stupendous
ultimate
thunder
were
shut
off
from
help
again
the
doors
had
closed
i
felt
a
storm
of
pity
an
agony
of
bitter
futile
hate
sweep
through
me
my
memory
of
the
figure
changed
then
the
woman
with
the
glass
of
cooling
water
had
stepped
down
from
heaven
but
the
man
or
was
it
men
who
smeared
this
terrible
layer
of
belief
and
thought
upon
the
world
i
crossed
the
it
was
fancy
of
course
that
held
my
eyes
from
glancing
at
the
portrait
for
fear
i
should
see
it
smiling
approval
and
so
finally
reached
the
hall
where
the
light
from
the
floor
above
seemed
now
quite
bright
in
comparison
all
the
doors
i
closed
carefully
behind
me
but
first
i
had
to
open
them
the
woman
had
closed
every
one
up
the
stairs
then
i
actually
ran
two
steps
at
a
time
my
sister
was
standing
outside
mabel
s
door
by
her
face
i
knew
that
she
had
also
heard
there
was
no
need
to
ask
i
quickly
made
my
mind
up
there
s
nothing
i
said
and
detailed
briefly
my
tour
of
search
all
is
quiet
and
undisturbed
may
god
forgive
me
she
beckoned
to
me
closing
the
door
softly
behind
her
my
heart
beat
violently
a
moment
then
stood
still
mabel
she
said
aloud
it
was
like
the
sentence
of
a
judge
that
one
short
word
i
tried
to
push
past
her
and
go
in
but
she
stopped
me
with
her
arm
she
was
wholly
mistress
of
herself
i
saw
hush
she
said
in
a
lower
voice
i
ve
got
her
round
again
with
brandy
she
s
sleeping
quietly
now
we
won
t
disturb
she
drew
me
farther
out
into
the
landing
and
as
she
did
so
the
clock
in
the
hall
below
struck
three
i
had
stood
then
thirty
minutes
in
the
corridor
below
you
ve
been
such
a
long
time
she
said
simply
i
feared
for
you
and
she
took
my
hand
in
her
own
that
was
cold
and
clammy
viii
and
then
while
that
dreadful
house
stood
listening
about
us
in
the
early
hours
of
this
chill
morning
upon
the
edge
of
winter
she
told
me
with
laconic
brevity
things
about
mabel
that
i
heard
as
from
a
distance
there
was
nothing
so
unusual
or
tremendous
in
the
short
recital
nothing
indeed
i
might
not
have
already
guessed
for
myself
it
was
the
time
and
scene
the
inference
too
that
made
it
so
afflicting
the
idea
that
mabel
believed
herself
so
utterly
and
hopelessly
lost
beyond
recovery
that
she
had
loved
him
with
so
passionate
a
devotion
that
she
had
given
her
soul
into
his
keeping
this
certainly
i
had
not
divined
probably
because
i
had
never
thought
about
it
one
way
or
the
other
he
had
converted
her
i
knew
but
that
she
had
subscribed
to
that
most
cruel
and
ugly
of
his
dogmas
this
was
new
to
me
and
came
with
a
certain
shock
as
i
heard
it
in
love
of
course
the
weaker
nature
is
receptive
to
all
manner
of
suggestion
this
man
had
suggested
his
pet
brimstone
lake
so
vividly
that
she
had
listened
and
believed
he
had
frightened
her
into
heaven
and
his
heaven
a
definite
locality
in
the
skies
had
its
foretaste
here
on
earth
in
miniature
the
towers
house
and
garden
into
his
dolorous
scheme
of
a
handful
saved
and
millions
damned
his
enclosure
as
it
were
of
sheep
and
goats
he
had
swept
her
before
she
was
aware
of
it
her
mind
no
longer
was
her
own
and
it
was
marsh
who
kept
the
open
though
tempered
as
she
deemed
with
that
touch
of
craven
superstitious
mercy
but
what
i
found
it
difficult
to
understand
and
still
more
difficult
to
accept
was
that
during
her
year
abroad
she
had
been
so
haunted
with
a
secret
dread
of
that
hideous
that
she
had
finally
revolted
and
tried
to
recover
that
clearer
state
of
mind
she
had
enjoyed
before
the
religious
bully
had
stunned
her
yet
had
tried
in
vain
she
had
returned
to
the
towers
to
find
her
soul
again
only
to
realise
that
it
was
lost
eternally
the
cleaner
state
of
mind
lay
then
beyond
recovery
in
the
reaction
that
followed
the
removal
of
his
terrible
suggestion
she
felt
the
crumbling
of
all
that
he
had
taught
her
but
searched
in
vain
for
the
peace
and
beauty
his
teachings
had
destroyed
nothing
came
to
replace
these
she
was
empty
desolate
hopeless
craving
her
former
joy
and
carelessness
she
found
only
hate
and
diabolical
calculation
this
man
whom
she
had
loved
to
the
point
of
losing
her
soul
for
him
had
bequeathed
to
her
one
black
and
fiery
thing
the
terror
of
the
damned
his
thinking
wrapped
her
in
this
iron
garment
that
held
her
fast
all
this
frances
told
me
far
more
briefly
than
i
have
here
repeated
it
in
her
eyes
and
gestures
and
laconic
sentences
lay
the
conviction
of
great
beating
issues
and
of
menacing
drama
my
own
description
fails
to
recapture
it
was
all
so
incongruous
and
remote
from
the
world
i
lived
in
that
more
than
once
a
smile
though
a
smile
of
pity
fluttered
to
my
lips
but
a
glimpse
of
my
face
in
the
mirror
showed
rather
the
leer
of
a
grimace
there
was
no
real
laughter
anywhere
that
night
the
entire
adventure
seemed
so
incredible
here
in
this
twentieth
century
but
yet
delusion
that
feeble
word
did
not
occur
once
in
the
comments
my
mind
suggested
though
did
not
utter
i
remembered
that
forbidding
shadow
too
my
sister
s
the
vanished
personality
of
our
hostess
the
inexplicable
thundering
noise
and
the
figure
of
marsh
in
her
midnight
ritual
that
was
so
childish
yet
so
horrible
i
shivered
in
spite
of
my
own
emancipated
cast
of
mind
there
no
mabel
were
the
words
with
which
my
sister
sent
another
shower
of
ice
down
my
spine
he
has
killed
her
in
his
lake
of
fire
and
i
stared
at
her
blankly
as
in
a
nightmare
where
nothing
true
or
possible
ever
happened
he
killed
her
in
his
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
she
repeated
more
faintly
a
desperate
effort
was
in
me
to
say
the
strong
sensible
thing
which
should
destroy
the
oppressive
horror
that
grew
so
stiflingly
about
us
both
but
again
the
mirror
drew
the
attempted
smile
into
the
merest
grin
betraying
the
distortion
that
was
everywhere
in
the
place
you
mean
i
stammered
beneath
my
breath
that
her
faith
has
gone
but
that
the
terror
has
remained
i
asked
it
dully
groping
i
moved
out
of
the
line
of
the
reflection
in
the
glass
she
bowed
her
head
as
though
beneath
a
weight
her
skin
was
the
pallor
of
grey
ashes
you
mean
i
said
louder
that
she
has
lost
her
mind
she
is
terror
incarnate
was
the
whispered
answer
mabel
has
lost
her
soul
her
soul
is
there
she
pointed
horribly
below
she
is
seeking
it
the
word
soul
stung
me
into
something
of
my
normal
self
again
but
her
terror
poor
thing
is
not
can
not
be
transferable
to
i
exclaimed
more
vehemently
it
certainly
is
not
convertible
into
feelings
sights
and
even
sounds
she
interrupted
me
quickly
almost
impatiently
speaking
with
that
conviction
by
which
she
conquered
me
so
easily
that
night
it
is
her
terror
that
has
revived
the
it
has
brought
her
into
touch
with
them
they
are
loose
and
driving
after
her
her
efforts
at
resistance
have
given
them
also
hope
that
escape
after
all
possible
day
and
night
they
escape
others
the
anger
fast
rising
in
me
dropped
of
its
own
accord
at
the
moment
of
birth
it
shrank
into
a
shuddering
beyond
my
control
in
that
moment
i
think
i
would
have
believed
in
the
possibility
of
anything
and
everything
she
might
tell
me
to
argue
or
contradict
seemed
equally
futile
his
strong
belief
as
also
the
beliefs
of
others
who
have
preceded
him
she
replied
so
sure
of
herself
that
i
actually
turned
to
look
over
my
shoulder
have
left
their
shadow
like
a
thick
deposit
over
the
house
and
grounds
to
them
poor
souls
imprisoned
by
thought
it
was
hopeless
as
granite
walls
until
her
resistance
her
effort
to
dissipate
it
let
in
light
now
in
their
thousands
they
are
flocking
to
this
little
light
seeking
escape
her
own
escape
don
t
you
see
may
release
them
all
it
took
my
breath
away
had
his
predecessors
former
occupants
of
this
house
also
preached
damnation
of
all
the
world
but
their
own
exclusive
sect
was
this
the
explanation
of
her
obscure
talk
of
layers
each
striving
against
the
other
for
domination
and
if
men
are
spirits
and
these
spirits
survive
could
strong
thought
thus
determine
their
condition
even
afterwards
so
many
questions
flooded
into
me
that
i
selected
no
one
of
them
but
stared
in
uncomfortable
silence
bewildered
out
of
my
depth
and
acutely
painfully
distressed
there
was
so
odd
a
mixture
of
possible
truth
and
incredible
unacceptable
explanation
in
it
all
so
much
confirmed
yet
so
much
left
darker
than
before
what
she
said
did
indeed
offer
a
of
my
own
series
of
abominable
sensations
strife
agony
pity
hate
escape
but
so
that
only
the
deep
conviction
in
her
voice
and
attitude
made
it
tolerable
for
a
second
even
i
found
myself
in
a
curious
state
of
mind
i
could
neither
think
clearly
nor
say
a
word
to
refute
her
amazing
statements
whispered
there
beside
me
in
the
shivering
hours
of
the
early
morning
with
only
a
wall
between
ourselves
and
mabel
close
behind
her
words
i
remember
this
singular
thing
however
that
an
atmosphere
as
of
the
inquisition
seemed
to
rise
and
stir
about
the
room
beating
awful
wings
of
black
above
my
head
abruptly
then
a
moment
s
returned
to
me
i
faced
her
and
the
noise
i
said
aloud
more
firmly
the
roar
of
the
closing
doors
we
have
heard
that
is
that
subjective
too
frances
looked
sideways
about
her
in
a
queer
fashion
that
made
my
flesh
creep
again
i
spoke
brusquely
almost
angrily
i
repeated
the
question
and
waited
with
anxiety
for
her
reply
what
noise
she
asked
with
the
frank
expression
of
an
innocent
child
what
closing
doors
but
her
face
turned
from
grey
to
white
and
i
saw
that
drops
of
perspiration
glistened
on
her
forehead
she
caught
at
the
back
of
a
chair
to
steady
herself
then
glanced
about
her
again
with
that
sidelong
look
that
made
my
blood
run
cold
i
understood
suddenly
then
she
did
not
take
in
what
i
said
i
knew
now
she
was
listening
for
something
else
and
the
discovery
revived
in
me
a
far
stronger
emotion
than
any
mere
desire
for
immediate
explanation
not
only
did
i
not
insist
upon
an
answer
but
i
was
actually
terrified
lest
she
answer
more
i
felt
in
me
a
terror
lest
i
should
be
moved
to
describe
my
own
experiences
thus
increasing
their
reality
and
so
the
reality
of
all
she
might
even
explain
them
too
still
listening
intently
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
me
in
the
eyes
her
lips
opened
to
speak
the
words
came
to
me
from
a
great
distance
it
seemed
and
her
voice
had
a
sound
like
a
stone
that
drops
into
a
deep
well
its
fate
though
hidden
known
we
are
in
it
with
her
too
bill
we
are
in
it
with
her
our
interpretations
vary
because
we
are
in
parts
of
it
only
mabel
is
in
it
the
desire
for
violence
came
over
me
if
only
she
would
say
a
definite
thing
in
plain
king
s
english
if
only
i
could
find
it
in
me
to
give
utterance
to
what
shouted
so
loud
within
me
if
only
the
same
old
cry
something
would
happen
for
all
this
elliptic
talk
that
dazed
my
mind
left
obscurity
everywhere
her
atrocious
meaning
none
the
less
flashed
through
me
though
vanishing
before
it
wholly
divulged
itself
it
brought
a
certain
reaction
with
it
i
found
my
tongue
whether
i
actually
believed
what
i
said
is
more
than
i
can
swear
to
that
it
seemed
to
me
wise
at
the
moment
is
all
i
remember
my
mind
was
in
a
state
of
obscure
perception
less
than
that
of
normal
consciousness
yes
frances
i
believe
that
what
you
say
is
the
truth
and
that
we
are
in
it
with
her
i
meant
to
say
it
with
loud
hostile
emphasis
but
instead
i
whispered
it
lest
she
should
hear
the
trembling
of
my
voice
and
for
that
reason
my
dear
sister
we
leave
you
and
i
rather
since
it
is
long
past
midnight
we
leave
this
house
of
the
damned
we
go
back
to
frances
looked
up
her
face
distraught
almost
beyond
recognition
but
it
was
not
my
words
that
caused
the
tumult
in
her
heart
it
was
a
sound
the
sound
she
had
been
listening
for
so
faint
i
barely
caught
it
myself
and
had
she
not
pointed
i
could
never
have
known
the
direction
whence
it
came
small
and
terrible
it
rose
again
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
the
sound
of
gnashing
teeth
and
behind
it
came
another
the
tread
of
stealthy
footsteps
both
were
just
outside
the
door
the
room
swung
round
me
for
a
second
my
first
instinct
to
prevent
my
sister
going
out
she
had
dashed
past
me
frantically
to
the
door
gave
place
to
another
when
i
saw
the
expression
in
her
eyes
i
followed
her
lead
instead
it
was
surer
than
my
own
the
pistol
in
my
pocket
swung
uselessly
against
my
thigh
i
was
flustered
beyond
belief
and
ashamed
that
i
was
so
keep
close
to
me
frances
i
said
huskily
as
the
door
swung
wide
and
a
shaft
of
light
fell
upon
a
figure
moving
rapidly
mabel
was
going
down
the
corridor
beyond
her
in
the
shadows
on
the
staircase
a
second
figure
stood
beckoning
scarcely
visible
before
they
get
her
quick
was
screamed
into
my
ears
and
our
arms
were
about
her
in
the
same
moment
it
was
a
horrible
scene
not
that
mabel
struggled
in
the
least
but
that
she
collapsed
as
we
caught
her
and
fell
with
her
dead
weight
as
of
a
corpse
limp
against
us
and
her
teeth
began
again
they
continued
even
beneath
the
hand
that
frances
clapped
upon
her
lips
we
carried
her
back
into
her
own
bedroom
where
she
lay
down
peacefully
enough
it
was
so
soon
over
the
rapidity
of
the
whole
thing
robbed
it
of
reality
almost
it
had
the
swiftness
of
something
remembered
rather
than
of
something
witnessed
she
slept
again
so
quickly
that
it
was
almost
as
if
we
had
caught
her
i
can
not
say
i
asked
no
questions
at
the
time
i
have
asked
none
since
and
my
help
was
needed
as
little
as
the
protection
of
my
pistol
frances
was
strangely
competent
and
collected
i
lingered
for
some
time
uselessly
by
the
door
till
at
length
looking
up
with
a
sigh
she
made
a
sign
for
me
to
go
i
shall
wait
in
your
room
next
door
i
whispered
till
you
but
though
going
out
i
waited
in
the
corridor
instead
so
as
to
hear
the
faintest
call
for
help
in
that
dark
corridor
upstairs
i
waited
but
not
long
it
may
have
been
fifteen
minutes
when
frances
reappeared
locking
the
door
softly
behind
her
leaning
over
the
banisters
i
saw
her
i
ll
go
in
again
about
six
o
clock
she
whispered
as
soon
as
it
gets
light
she
is
sound
asleep
now
please
don
t
wait
if
anything
happens
i
ll
call
you
might
leave
your
door
ajar
and
she
came
up
looking
like
a
ghost
but
i
saw
her
first
safely
into
bed
and
the
rest
of
the
night
i
spent
in
an
armchair
close
to
my
opened
door
listening
for
the
slightest
sound
soon
after
five
o
clock
i
heard
frances
fumbling
with
the
key
and
peering
over
the
railing
again
i
waited
till
she
reappeared
and
went
back
into
her
own
room
she
closed
her
door
evidently
she
was
satisfied
that
all
was
well
then
and
then
only
did
i
go
to
bed
myself
but
not
to
sleep
i
could
not
get
the
scene
out
of
my
mind
especially
that
odious
detail
of
it
which
i
hoped
and
believed
my
sister
had
not
seen
the
still
dark
figure
of
the
housekeeper
waiting
on
the
stairs
below
waiting
of
course
for
mabel
ix
it
seems
i
became
a
mere
spectator
after
that
my
sister
s
lead
was
so
assured
for
one
thing
and
for
another
the
responsibility
of
leaving
mabel
alone
frances
laid
it
bodily
upon
my
shoulders
was
a
little
more
than
i
cared
about
moreover
when
we
all
three
met
later
in
the
day
things
went
on
so
exactly
as
before
so
absolutely
without
friction
or
distress
that
to
present
a
sudden
obvious
excuse
for
cutting
our
visit
short
seemed
and
on
the
lowest
grounds
it
would
have
been
desertion
at
any
rate
it
was
beyond
my
powers
and
frances
was
quite
firm
that
must
stay
we
therefore
did
stay
things
that
happen
in
the
night
always
seem
exaggerated
and
distorted
when
the
sun
shines
brightly
next
morning
no
one
can
reconstruct
the
terror
of
a
nightmare
afterwards
nor
comprehend
why
it
seemed
so
overwhelming
at
the
time
i
slept
till
ten
o
clock
and
when
i
rang
for
breakfast
a
note
from
my
sister
lay
upon
the
tray
its
message
of
counsel
couched
in
a
calm
and
comforting
strain
mabel
she
assured
me
was
herself
again
and
remembered
nothing
of
what
had
happened
there
was
no
need
of
any
violent
measures
i
was
to
treat
her
exactly
as
if
i
knew
nothing
and
if
you
don
t
mind
bill
let
us
leave
the
matter
unmentioned
between
ourselves
as
well
discussion
exaggerates
such
things
are
best
not
talked
about
i
m
sorry
i
disturbed
you
so
unnecessarily
i
was
stupidly
excited
please
forget
all
the
things
i
said
at
the
she
had
written
nonsense
first
instead
of
things
then
scratched
it
out
she
wished
to
convey
that
hysteria
had
been
abroad
in
the
night
and
i
readily
gulped
the
explanation
down
though
it
could
not
satisfy
me
in
the
smallest
degree
there
was
another
week
of
our
visit
still
and
we
stayed
it
out
to
the
end
without
disaster
my
desire
to
leave
at
times
became
that
frantic
thing
desire
to
escape
but
i
controlled
it
kept
silent
watched
and
wondered
nothing
happened
as
before
and
everywhere
there
was
no
sequence
of
development
no
connection
between
cause
and
effect
and
climax
none
whatever
the
thing
swayed
up
and
down
backwards
and
forwards
like
a
great
loose
curtain
in
the
wind
and
i
could
only
vaguely
surmise
what
caused
the
draught
or
why
there
was
a
curtain
at
all
a
novelist
might
mould
the
queer
material
into
coherent
sequence
that
would
be
interesting
but
could
not
be
true
it
remains
therefore
not
a
story
but
a
history
nothing
happened
perhaps
my
intense
dislike
of
the
fall
of
darkness
was
due
wholly
to
my
stirred
imagination
and
perhaps
my
anger
when
i
learned
that
frances
now
occupied
a
bed
in
our
hostess
s
room
was
unreasonable
nerves
were
unquestionably
on
edge
i
was
for
ever
on
the
for
some
event
that
should
make
escape
imperative
but
yet
that
never
presented
itself
i
slept
lightly
left
my
door
ajar
to
catch
the
slightest
sound
even
made
stealthy
tours
of
the
house
while
everybody
dreamed
in
their
beds
but
i
discovered
nothing
the
doors
were
always
locked
i
neither
saw
the
housekeeper
again
in
unreasonable
times
and
places
nor
heard
a
footstep
in
the
passages
and
halls
the
noise
was
never
once
repeated
that
horrible
ultimate
thunder
my
intensest
dread
of
all
lay
withdrawn
into
the
abyss
whence
it
had
twice
arisen
and
though
in
my
thoughts
it
was
sternly
denied
existence
the
great
black
reason
for
the
fact
afflicted
me
unbelievably
since
mabel
s
fruitless
effort
to
escape
the
doors
kept
closed
remorselessly
she
had
failed
gave
up
hope
for
this
was
the
explanation
that
haunted
the
region
of
my
mind
where
feelings
stir
and
hint
before
they
clothe
themselves
in
actual
language
only
i
firmly
kept
it
there
it
never
knew
expression
but
if
my
ears
were
open
my
eyes
were
opened
too
and
it
were
idle
to
pretend
that
i
did
not
notice
a
hundred
details
that
were
capable
of
sinister
interpretation
had
i
been
weak
enough
to
yield
some
protective
barrier
had
fallen
into
ruins
round
me
so
that
terror
stalked
behind
the
general
collapse
feeling
for
me
through
all
the
gaping
fissures
much
of
this
i
admit
must
have
been
merely
the
elaboration
of
those
sensations
i
had
first
vaguely
felt
before
subsequent
events
and
my
talks
with
frances
had
dramatised
them
into
living
thoughts
i
therefore
leave
them
unmentioned
in
this
history
just
as
my
mind
left
them
unmentioned
in
that
interminable
final
week
our
life
went
on
precisely
as
before
mabel
unreal
and
outwardly
so
still
frances
secretive
anxious
tactful
to
the
point
of
slyness
and
keen
to
save
to
the
point
of
there
were
the
same
stupid
meals
the
same
wearisome
long
evenings
the
stifling
ugliness
of
house
and
grounds
the
shadow
settling
in
so
thickly
that
it
seemed
almost
a
visible
tangible
thing
i
came
to
feel
the
only
friendly
things
in
all
this
hostile
cruel
place
were
the
robins
that
hopped
boldly
over
the
monstrous
terraces
and
even
up
to
the
windows
of
the
unsightly
house
itself
the
robins
alone
knew
joy
they
danced
believing
no
evil
thing
was
possible
in
all
god
s
radiant
world
they
believed
in
everybody
god
s
plan
of
life
had
no
room
in
it
for
hell
damnation
and
lakes
of
brimstone
i
came
to
love
the
little
birds
had
samuel
franklyn
known
them
he
might
have
preached
a
different
sermon
bequeathing
love
in
place
of
terror
most
of
my
time
i
spent
writing
but
it
was
a
pretence
at
best
and
rather
a
dangerous
one
besides
for
it
stirred
the
mind
to
production
with
the
result
that
other
things
came
pouring
in
as
well
with
reading
it
was
the
same
in
the
end
i
found
an
aggressive
deliberate
resistance
to
be
the
only
way
of
feasible
defence
to
walk
far
afield
was
out
of
the
question
for
it
meant
leaving
my
sister
too
long
alone
so
that
my
exercise
was
confined
to
nearer
home
my
saunters
in
the
grounds
however
never
surprised
the
goblin
garden
again
it
was
close
at
hand
but
i
seemed
unable
to
get
wholly
into
it
too
many
things
assailed
my
mind
for
any
one
to
hold
exclusive
possession
perhaps
indeed
all
the
interpretations
all
the
layers
to
use
my
sister
s
phrase
slipped
in
by
turns
and
lodged
there
for
a
time
they
came
day
and
night
and
though
my
reason
denied
them
entrance
they
held
their
own
as
by
a
kind
of
squatters
right
they
stirred
moods
already
in
me
that
is
and
did
not
introduce
entirely
new
ones
for
every
mind
conceals
ancestral
deposits
that
have
been
cultivated
in
turn
along
the
whole
line
of
its
descent
any
day
a
chance
shower
may
cause
this
one
or
that
to
blossom
thus
it
came
to
me
at
any
rate
after
darkness
the
inquisition
paced
the
empty
corridors
and
set
up
ghastly
apparatus
in
the
dismal
halls
and
once
in
the
library
there
swept
over
me
that
easy
and
delicious
conviction
that
by
confessing
my
wickedness
i
could
resume
it
later
since
confession
is
expression
and
expression
brings
relief
and
leaves
one
ready
to
accumulate
again
and
in
such
mood
i
felt
bitter
and
unforgiving
towards
all
others
who
thought
differently
another
time
it
was
a
pagan
thing
that
assaulted
me
so
trivial
yet
oh
so
significant
at
the
time
when
i
dreamed
that
a
herd
of
centaurs
rolled
up
with
a
great
stamping
of
hoofs
round
the
house
to
destroy
it
and
then
woke
to
hear
the
horses
tramping
across
the
field
below
the
lawns
they
neighed
ominously
and
their
noisy
panting
was
audible
as
if
it
were
just
outside
my
windows
but
the
tree
episode
i
think
was
the
most
curious
of
all
except
perhaps
the
incident
with
the
children
which
i
shall
mention
in
a
moment
for
its
closeness
to
reality
was
so
unforgettable
outside
the
east
window
of
my
room
stood
a
giant
wellingtonia
on
the
lawn
its
head
rising
level
with
the
upper
sash
it
grew
some
twenty
feet
away
planted
on
the
highest
terrace
and
i
often
saw
it
when
closing
my
curtains
for
the
night
noticing
how
it
drew
its
heavy
skirts
about
it
and
how
the
light
from
other
windows
threw
glimmering
streaks
and
patches
that
turned
it
into
the
semblance
of
a
towering
solemn
image
it
stood
there
then
so
strikingly
somehow
like
a
great
idol
that
it
claimed
attention
its
appearance
was
curiously
formidable
its
branches
rustled
without
visibly
moving
and
it
had
a
certain
portentous
forbidding
air
so
grand
and
dark
and
monstrous
in
the
night
that
i
was
always
glad
when
my
curtains
shut
it
out
yet
once
in
bed
i
had
never
thought
about
it
one
way
or
the
other
and
by
day
had
certainly
never
sought
it
out
one
night
then
as
i
went
to
bed
and
closed
this
window
against
a
cutting
easterly
wind
i
saw
that
there
were
two
of
these
trees
a
brother
wellingtonia
rose
mysteriously
beside
it
equally
huge
equally
towering
equally
monstrous
the
menacing
pair
of
them
faced
me
there
upon
the
lawn
but
in
this
new
arrival
lay
a
strange
suggestion
that
frightened
me
before
i
could
argue
it
away
exact
counterpart
of
its
giant
companion
it
revealed
also
that
gross
odious
quality
that
all
my
sister
s
paintings
held
i
got
the
odd
impression
that
the
rest
of
these
trees
stretching
away
dimly
in
a
troop
over
the
farther
lawns
were
similar
and
that
led
by
this
enormous
pair
they
had
all
moved
boldly
closer
to
my
windows
at
the
same
moment
a
blind
was
drawn
down
over
an
upper
room
the
second
tree
disappeared
into
the
surrounding
darkness
it
was
of
course
this
chance
light
that
had
brought
it
into
the
field
of
vision
but
when
the
black
shutter
dropped
over
it
hiding
it
from
view
the
manner
of
its
vanishing
produced
the
queer
effect
that
it
had
slipped
into
its
companion
almost
that
it
had
been
an
emanation
of
the
one
i
so
disliked
and
not
really
a
tree
at
all
in
this
way
the
garden
turned
vehicle
for
expressing
what
lay
behind
it
all
the
behaviour
of
the
doors
the
little
ordinary
doors
seems
scarcely
worth
mention
at
all
their
queer
way
of
opening
and
shutting
of
their
own
accord
for
this
was
accountable
in
a
hundred
natural
ways
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
never
caught
one
in
the
act
of
moving
indeed
only
after
frequent
repetitions
did
the
detail
force
itself
upon
me
when
having
noticed
one
i
noticed
all
it
produced
however
the
unpleasant
impression
of
a
continual
coming
and
going
in
the
house
as
though
screened
cleverly
and
purposely
from
actual
sight
some
one
in
the
building
held
constant
invisible
intercourse
with
others
upon
detailed
descriptions
of
these
uncertain
incidents
i
do
not
venture
individually
so
trivial
but
taken
all
together
so
impressive
and
so
insolent
but
the
episode
of
the
children
mentioned
above
was
different
and
i
give
it
because
it
showed
how
vividly
the
intuitive
received
the
impression
one
impression
at
any
rate
of
what
was
in
the
air
it
may
be
told
in
a
very
few
words
i
believe
they
were
the
coachman
s
children
and
that
the
man
had
been
in
franklyn
s
service
but
of
neither
point
am
i
quite
positive
i
heard
screaming
in
the
that
runs
along
the
stable
walls
it
was
one
afternoon
not
far
from
the
and
on
hurrying
up
i
found
a
little
girl
of
nine
or
ten
fastened
with
ropes
to
a
rustic
seat
and
two
other
children
boys
one
about
twelve
and
one
much
younger
gathering
sticks
beneath
the
climbing
the
girl
was
white
and
frightened
but
the
others
were
laughing
and
talking
among
themselves
so
busily
while
they
picked
that
they
did
not
notice
my
abrupt
arrival
some
game
i
understood
was
in
progress
but
a
game
that
had
become
too
serious
for
the
happiness
of
the
prisoner
for
there
was
a
fear
in
the
girl
s
eyes
that
was
a
very
genuine
fear
indeed
i
unfastened
her
at
once
the
ropes
were
so
loosely
and
clumsily
knotted
that
they
had
not
hurt
her
skin
it
was
not
that
which
made
her
pale
she
collapsed
a
moment
upon
the
bench
then
picked
up
her
tiny
skirts
and
dived
away
at
full
speed
into
the
safety
of
the
there
was
no
response
to
my
brief
comforting
but
she
ran
as
though
for
her
life
and
i
divined
that
some
horrid
boys
cruelty
had
been
afoot
it
was
probably
mere
thoughtlessness
as
cruelty
with
children
usually
is
but
something
in
me
decided
to
discover
exactly
what
it
was
and
the
boys
not
one
whit
alarmed
at
my
intervention
merely
laughed
shyly
when
i
explained
that
their
prisoner
had
escaped
and
told
me
frankly
what
their
gime
had
been
there
was
no
vestige
of
shame
in
them
nor
any
idea
of
course
that
they
aped
a
monstrous
reality
that
it
was
mere
pretence
was
neither
here
nor
there
to
them
though
it
was
a
of
something
that
was
right
and
natural
and
in
no
sense
cruel
did
it
too
it
was
necessary
for
her
good
we
was
going
to
burn
her
up
sir
the
older
one
informed
me
answering
my
why
with
the
explanation
because
she
wouldn
t
believe
what
we
wanted
er
to
and
game
though
it
was
the
feeling
of
reality
about
the
little
episode
was
so
arresting
so
terrific
in
some
way
that
only
with
difficulty
did
i
confine
my
admonitions
on
this
occasion
to
mere
words
the
boys
slunk
off
frightened
in
their
turn
yet
not
i
felt
convinced
that
they
had
erred
in
principle
it
was
their
inheritance
they
had
breathed
it
in
with
the
atmosphere
of
their
they
would
renew
the
salutary
torture
when
they
could
till
she
believed
as
they
did
i
went
back
into
the
house
afflicted
with
a
passion
of
mingled
pity
and
distress
impossible
to
describe
yet
on
my
short
way
across
the
garden
was
attacked
by
other
moods
in
turn
each
more
real
and
bitter
than
its
predecessor
i
received
the
whole
series
as
it
were
at
once
i
felt
like
a
diver
rising
to
the
surface
through
layers
of
water
at
different
temperatures
though
here
the
natural
order
was
reversed
and
the
cooler
strata
were
uppermost
the
heated
ones
below
thus
i
was
caught
by
the
goblin
touch
of
the
willows
that
fringed
the
field
by
the
sensuous
curving
of
the
twisted
ash
that
formed
a
gateway
to
the
little
grove
of
sapling
oaks
where
fauns
and
satyrs
lurked
to
play
in
the
moonlight
before
pagan
altars
and
by
the
cloaking
darkness
next
of
the
copse
of
stunted
pines
close
gathered
each
to
each
where
hooded
figures
stalked
behind
an
awful
cross
the
episode
with
the
children
seemed
to
have
opened
me
like
a
knife
the
whole
place
rushed
at
me
i
suspect
this
synthesis
of
many
moods
produced
in
me
that
climax
of
loathing
and
disgust
which
made
me
feel
the
limit
of
bearable
emotion
had
been
reached
so
that
i
made
straight
to
find
frances
in
order
to
convince
her
that
at
any
rate
must
leave
for
although
this
was
our
last
day
in
the
house
and
we
had
arranged
to
go
next
day
the
dread
was
in
me
that
she
would
still
find
some
persuasive
reason
for
staying
on
and
an
unexpected
incident
then
made
my
dread
unnecessary
the
front
door
was
open
and
a
cab
stood
in
the
drive
a
tall
elderly
man
was
gravely
talking
in
the
hall
with
the
we
called
the
grenadier
he
held
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
i
have
called
to
see
the
house
i
heard
him
say
as
i
ran
up
the
stairs
to
frances
who
was
peering
like
an
inquisitive
child
over
the
banisters
yes
she
told
me
with
a
sigh
i
know
not
whether
of
resignation
or
relief
the
house
is
to
be
let
or
sold
mabel
has
decided
some
society
or
other
i
believe
i
was
overjoyed
this
made
our
leaving
right
and
possible
you
never
told
me
frances
mabel
only
heard
of
it
a
few
days
ago
she
told
me
herself
this
morning
it
is
a
chance
she
says
alone
she
can
not
get
it
defeat
i
asked
watching
her
closely
she
thinks
she
has
found
a
way
out
it
s
not
a
family
you
see
it
s
a
society
a
sort
of
community
they
go
in
for
thought
a
community
i
gasped
you
mean
religious
she
shook
her
head
not
exactly
she
said
smiling
but
some
kind
of
association
of
men
and
women
who
want
a
headquarters
in
the
country
a
place
where
they
can
write
and
meditate
mature
their
plans
and
all
the
rest
i
don
t
know
exactly
utopian
dreamers
i
asked
yet
feeling
an
immense
relief
come
over
me
as
i
heard
but
i
asked
in
ignorance
not
cynically
frances
would
know
she
knew
all
this
kind
of
thing
no
not
that
exactly
she
smiled
their
teachings
are
grand
and
simple
old
as
the
world
too
really
the
basis
of
every
religion
before
men
s
mind
perverted
them
with
their
manufactured
creeds
footsteps
on
the
stairs
and
the
sound
of
voices
interrupted
our
odd
impromptu
conversation
as
the
grenadier
came
up
followed
by
the
tall
grave
gentleman
who
was
being
shown
over
the
house
my
sister
drew
me
along
the
corridor
towards
her
room
where
she
went
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
me
yet
not
before
i
had
stolen
a
good
look
at
the
caller
long
enough
at
least
for
his
face
and
general
appearance
to
have
made
a
definite
impression
on
me
for
something
strong
and
peaceful
emanated
from
his
presence
he
moved
with
such
quiet
dignity
the
glance
of
his
eyes
was
so
steady
and
reassuring
that
my
mind
labelled
him
instantly
as
a
type
of
man
one
would
turn
to
in
an
emergency
and
not
be
disappointed
i
had
seen
him
but
for
a
passing
moment
but
i
had
seen
him
twice
and
the
way
he
walked
down
the
passage
looking
competently
about
him
conveyed
the
same
impression
as
when
i
saw
him
standing
at
the
door
fearless
tolerant
wise
a
sincere
and
kindly
character
i
judged
instantly
a
man
whom
some
big
kind
of
love
has
trained
in
sweetness
towards
the
world
no
hate
in
him
a
great
deal
no
doubt
to
read
in
so
brief
a
glance
yet
his
voice
confirmed
my
intuition
a
deep
and
very
gentle
voice
great
firmness
in
it
too
have
i
become
suddenly
sensitive
to
people
s
atmospheres
in
this
extraordinary
fashion
i
asked
myself
smiling
as
i
stood
in
the
room
and
heard
the
door
close
behind
me
have
i
developed
some
clairvoyant
faculty
here
at
any
other
time
i
should
have
mocked
and
i
sat
down
and
faced
my
sister
feeling
strangely
comforted
and
at
peace
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
stepped
beneath
the
towers
roof
a
month
ago
frances
i
then
saw
was
smiling
a
little
as
she
watched
me
you
know
him
i
asked
you
felt
it
too
was
her
question
in
reply
no
she
added
i
don
t
know
him
beyond
the
fact
that
he
is
a
leader
in
the
movement
and
has
devoted
years
and
money
to
its
objects
mabel
felt
the
same
thing
in
him
that
you
have
felt
and
jumped
at
but
you
ve
seen
him
before
i
urged
for
the
certainty
was
in
me
that
he
was
no
stranger
to
her
she
shook
her
head
he
called
one
day
early
this
week
when
you
were
out
mabel
saw
him
i
believe
she
hesitated
a
moment
as
though
expecting
me
to
stop
her
with
my
usual
impatience
of
such
subjects
i
believe
he
has
explained
everything
to
her
the
beliefs
he
embodies
she
declares
are
her
salvation
might
be
rather
if
she
could
adopt
conversion
again
for
i
remembered
her
riches
and
how
gladly
a
society
would
gobble
them
the
layers
i
told
you
about
she
continued
calmly
shrugging
her
shoulders
slightly
the
deposits
that
are
left
behind
by
strong
thinking
and
belief
but
especially
by
ugly
hateful
belief
because
you
see
there
s
more
vital
passion
in
that
sort
frances
i
don
t
understand
a
bit
i
said
out
loud
but
said
it
a
little
humbly
for
the
impression
the
man
had
left
was
still
strong
upon
me
and
i
was
grateful
for
the
steady
sense
of
peace
and
comfort
he
had
somehow
introduced
the
horrors
had
been
so
dreadful
my
nerves
doubtless
were
more
than
a
little
overstrained
absurd
as
it
must
sound
i
classed
him
in
my
mind
with
the
robins
the
happy
confiding
robins
who
believed
in
everybody
and
thought
no
evil
i
laughed
a
moment
at
my
ridiculous
idea
and
my
sister
encouraged
by
this
sign
of
patience
in
me
continued
more
fluently
of
course
you
don
t
understand
bill
why
should
you
you
ve
never
thought
about
such
things
needing
no
creed
yourself
you
think
all
creeds
are
i
m
open
to
conviction
i
m
tolerant
i
interrupted
you
re
as
narrow
as
sam
franklyn
and
as
crammed
with
prejudice
she
answered
knowing
that
she
had
me
at
her
mercy
then
pray
what
may
be
his
or
his
society
s
beliefs
i
asked
feeling
no
desire
to
argue
and
how
are
they
going
to
prove
your
mabel
s
salvation
can
they
bring
beauty
into
all
this
aggressive
hate
and
ugliness
certain
hope
and
peace
she
said
that
peace
which
is
understanding
and
that
understanding
which
explains
creeds
and
therefore
tolerates
toleration
the
one
word
a
religious
man
loathes
above
all
others
his
pet
word
is
damnation
tolerates
them
she
repeated
patiently
unperturbed
by
my
explosion
because
it
includes
them
fine
if
true
i
admitted
very
fine
but
how
pray
does
it
include
them
all
because
the
the
motto
of
their
society
is
there
is
no
religion
higher
than
truth
and
it
has
no
single
dogma
of
any
kind
above
all
she
went
on
because
it
claims
that
no
individual
can
be
it
teaches
universal
salvation
to
damn
outsiders
is
uncivilised
childish
impure
some
take
longer
than
others
it
s
according
to
the
way
they
think
and
live
but
all
find
peace
through
development
in
the
end
what
the
creeds
call
a
hopeless
soul
it
regards
as
a
soul
having
further
to
go
there
is
no
damnation
well
well
i
exclaimed
feeling
that
she
rode
her
too
wildly
too
roughly
over
me
but
what
is
the
bearing
of
all
this
upon
this
dreadful
place
and
upon
mabel
i
ll
admit
that
there
is
this
atmosphere
this
er
inexplicable
horror
in
the
house
and
grounds
and
that
if
not
of
damnation
exactly
it
is
certainly
damnable
i
m
not
too
prejudiced
to
deny
for
i
ve
felt
it
to
my
relief
she
was
brief
she
made
her
statement
leaving
me
to
take
it
or
reject
it
as
i
would
the
thought
and
belief
its
former
occupants
have
left
behind
for
there
has
been
coincidence
here
a
coincidence
that
must
be
rare
the
site
on
which
this
modern
house
now
stands
was
roman
before
that
early
britain
with
burial
mounds
before
that
again
druid
the
druid
stones
still
lie
in
that
copse
below
the
field
the
tumuli
among
the
ilexes
behind
the
drive
the
older
building
sam
franklyn
altered
and
practically
pulled
down
was
a
monastery
he
changed
the
chapel
into
a
meeting
hall
which
is
now
the
music
room
but
before
he
came
here
the
house
was
occupied
by
manetti
a
violent
catholic
without
tolerance
or
vision
and
in
the
interval
between
these
two
julius
weinbaum
had
it
hebrew
of
most
rigid
orthodox
type
imaginable
so
they
all
have
left
their
even
so
i
repeated
yet
interested
to
hear
the
rest
what
of
it
simply
this
said
frances
with
conviction
that
each
in
turn
has
left
his
layer
of
concentrated
thinking
and
belief
behind
him
because
each
believed
intensely
absolutely
beyond
the
least
weakening
of
any
doubt
the
kind
of
strong
belief
and
thinking
that
is
rare
anywhere
the
kind
that
wills
impregnates
objects
saturates
the
atmosphere
haunts
in
a
word
and
each
believing
he
was
utterly
and
finally
right
damned
with
equally
positive
conviction
the
rest
of
the
world
one
and
all
preached
that
implicitly
if
not
explicitly
it
s
the
root
of
every
creed
last
of
the
bigoted
grim
series
came
samuel
i
listened
in
amazement
that
increased
as
she
went
on
up
to
this
point
her
explanation
was
so
admirable
it
was
indeed
a
pretty
study
in
psychology
if
it
were
true
then
why
does
nothing
ever
happen
i
enquired
mildly
a
place
so
thickly
haunted
ought
to
produce
a
crop
of
no
ordinary
results
there
lies
the
proof
she
went
on
in
a
lowered
voice
the
proof
of
the
horror
and
the
ugly
reality
the
thought
and
belief
of
each
occupant
in
turn
kept
all
the
others
under
they
gave
no
sign
of
life
at
the
time
but
the
results
of
thinking
never
die
they
crop
out
again
the
moment
there
s
an
opening
and
with
the
return
of
mabel
in
her
negative
state
believing
nothing
positive
herself
the
place
for
the
first
time
found
itself
free
to
reproduce
its
buried
stores
damnation
and
the
rest
the
most
permanent
and
vital
thought
of
all
those
creeds
since
it
was
applied
to
the
majority
of
the
world
broke
loose
again
for
there
was
no
restraint
to
hold
it
back
each
sought
to
obtain
its
former
supremacy
none
conquered
there
results
a
pandemonium
of
hate
and
fear
of
striving
to
escape
of
agonised
bitter
warring
to
find
safety
peace
salvation
the
place
is
saturated
by
that
appalling
stream
of
thinking
the
terror
of
the
damned
it
concentrated
upon
mabel
whose
negative
attitude
furnished
the
channel
of
deliverance
you
and
i
according
to
our
sympathy
with
her
were
similarly
involved
nothing
happened
because
no
one
layer
could
ever
gain
the
i
was
so
interested
i
dare
not
say
amused
that
i
stared
in
silence
while
she
paused
a
moment
afraid
that
she
would
draw
rein
and
end
the
fairy
tale
too
soon
the
beliefs
of
this
man
of
his
society
rather
vigorously
thought
and
therefore
vigorously
given
out
here
will
put
the
whole
place
straight
it
will
act
as
a
solvent
these
vitriolic
layers
actively
denied
will
fuse
and
disappear
in
the
stream
of
gentle
tolerant
sympathy
which
is
love
for
each
member
worthy
of
the
name
loves
the
world
and
all
creeds
go
into
the
mabel
too
if
she
joins
them
out
of
real
conviction
will
find
salvation
thinking
i
know
is
of
the
first
importance
i
objected
but
don
t
you
perhaps
exaggerate
the
power
of
feeling
and
emotion
which
in
religion
are
always
hysterical
what
the
world
she
told
me
but
thinking
and
feeling
an
individual
s
world
is
entirely
what
that
individual
thinks
and
believes
interpretation
there
is
no
other
and
unless
he
really
thinks
and
really
believes
he
has
no
permanent
world
at
all
i
grant
that
few
people
think
and
still
fewer
believe
and
that
most
take
suits
and
make
them
do
only
the
strong
make
their
own
things
the
lesser
fry
mabel
among
them
are
merely
swept
up
into
what
has
been
manufactured
for
them
they
get
along
somehow
you
and
i
have
made
for
ourselves
mabel
has
not
she
is
a
nonentity
and
when
her
belief
is
taken
from
her
she
goes
with
it
was
not
in
me
just
then
to
criticise
the
evasion
or
pick
out
the
sophistry
from
the
truth
i
merely
waited
for
her
to
continue
none
of
us
have
truth
my
dear
frances
i
ventured
presently
seeing
that
she
kept
silent
precisely
she
answered
but
most
of
us
have
beliefs
and
what
one
believes
and
thinks
affects
the
world
at
large
consider
the
legacy
of
hatred
and
cruelty
involved
in
the
doctrines
men
have
built
into
their
creeds
where
the
qua
of
salvation
is
absolute
acceptance
of
one
particular
set
of
views
or
else
perishing
everlastingly
for
only
by
repudiating
history
can
they
disavow
it
you
re
not
quite
accurate
i
put
in
not
all
the
creeds
teach
damnation
do
they
franklyn
did
of
course
but
the
others
are
a
bit
modernised
now
surely
trying
to
get
out
of
it
she
admitted
perhaps
they
are
but
damnation
of
unbelievers
of
most
of
the
world
that
is
is
their
rather
favourite
idea
if
you
talk
with
i
never
she
smiled
but
i
have
she
said
significantly
so
if
you
consider
what
the
various
occupants
of
this
house
have
so
strongly
held
and
thought
and
believed
you
need
not
be
surprised
that
the
influence
they
have
left
behind
them
should
be
a
dark
and
dreadful
legacy
for
thought
you
know
does
leave
the
opening
of
the
door
to
my
great
relief
interrupted
her
as
the
grenadier
led
in
the
visitor
to
see
the
room
he
bowed
to
both
of
us
with
a
brief
word
of
apology
looked
round
him
and
withdrew
and
with
his
departure
the
conversation
between
us
came
naturally
to
an
end
i
followed
him
out
neither
of
us
in
any
case
i
think
cared
to
argue
further
and
so
far
as
i
am
aware
the
curious
history
of
the
towers
ends
here
too
there
was
no
climax
in
the
story
sense
nothing
ever
really
happened
we
left
next
morning
for
london
i
only
know
that
the
society
in
question
took
the
house
and
have
since
occupied
it
to
their
entire
satisfaction
and
that
mabel
who
became
a
member
shortly
afterwards
now
stays
there
frequently
when
in
need
of
repose
from
the
arduous
and
unselfish
labours
she
took
upon
herself
under
its
aegis
she
dined
with
us
only
the
other
night
here
in
our
tiny
chelsea
flat
and
a
jollier
saner
more
interesting
and
happy
guest
i
could
hardly
wish
for
she
was
vital
in
the
best
sense
the
had
come
to
life
i
found
it
difficult
to
believe
she
was
the
same
woman
whose
fearful
effigy
had
floated
down
those
dreary
corridors
and
almost
disappeared
in
the
depths
of
that
atrocious
shadow
what
her
beliefs
were
now
i
was
wise
enough
to
leave
unquestioned
and
frances
to
my
great
relief
kept
the
conversation
well
away
from
such
inappropriate
topics
it
was
clear
however
that
the
woman
had
in
herself
some
secret
source
of
joy
that
she
was
now
an
aggressive
positive
force
sure
of
herself
and
apparently
afraid
of
nothing
in
heaven
or
hell
she
radiated
something
very
like
hope
and
courage
about
her
and
talked
as
though
the
world
were
a
glorious
place
and
everybody
in
it
kind
and
beautiful
her
optimism
was
certainly
infectious
the
towers
were
mentioned
only
in
passing
the
name
of
marsh
came
up
not
marsh
it
so
happened
but
a
name
in
some
book
that
was
being
discussed
and
i
was
unable
to
restrain
myself
curiosity
was
too
strong
i
threw
out
a
casual
enquiry
mabel
could
leave
unanswered
if
she
wished
but
there
was
no
desire
to
avoid
it
her
reply
was
frank
and
smiling
would
you
believe
it
she
married
mabel
told
me
though
obviously
surprised
that
i
remembered
the
housekeeper
at
all
and
is
happy
as
the
day
is
long
she
s
found
her
right
niche
in
life
a
sergeant
the
army
i
ejaculated
salvation
army
she
explained
merrily
frances
exchanged
a
glance
with
me
i
laughed
too
for
the
information
took
me
by
surprise
i
can
not
say
why
exactly
but
i
expected
at
least
to
hear
that
the
woman
had
met
some
dreadful
end
not
impossibly
by
burning
and
the
towers
now
called
the
rest
house
mabel
chattered
on
seems
to
me
the
most
peaceful
and
delightful
spot
in
england
really
i
said
politely
when
i
lived
there
in
the
old
days
while
you
were
there
perhaps
though
i
won
t
be
sure
mabel
went
on
the
story
got
abroad
that
it
was
haunted
wasn
t
it
odd
a
less
likely
place
for
a
ghost
i
ve
never
seen
why
it
had
no
atmosphere
at
she
said
this
to
frances
glancing
up
at
me
with
a
smile
that
apparently
had
no
hidden
meaning
did
notice
anything
queer
about
it
when
you
were
there
this
was
plainly
addressed
to
me
i
found
it
er
difficult
to
settle
down
to
anything
i
said
after
an
instant
s
hesitation
i
couldn
t
work
there
but
i
thought
you
wrote
that
wonderful
book
on
the
deaf
and
blind
while
you
stayed
with
me
she
asked
innocently
i
stammered
a
little
oh
no
not
then
i
only
made
a
few
notes
er
at
the
towers
my
mind
oddly
enough
refused
to
produce
at
all
down
there
but
why
do
you
ask
did
anything
was
anything
to
happen
there
she
looked
searchingly
into
my
eyes
a
moment
before
she
answered
not
that
i
know
of
she
said
simply
a
descent
into
egypt
i
he
was
an
accomplished
versatile
man
whom
some
called
brilliant
behind
his
talents
lay
a
wealth
of
material
that
right
selection
could
have
lifted
into
genuine
distinction
he
did
too
many
things
however
to
excel
in
one
for
a
restless
curiosity
kept
him
ever
on
the
move
george
isley
was
an
able
man
his
short
career
in
diplomacy
proved
it
yet
when
he
abandoned
this
for
travel
and
exploration
no
one
thought
it
a
pity
he
would
do
big
things
in
any
line
he
was
merely
finding
himself
among
the
rolling
stones
of
humanity
a
few
acquire
moss
of
considerable
value
they
are
not
necessarily
shiftless
they
travel
light
the
comfortable
pockets
in
the
game
of
life
that
attract
the
majority
are
too
small
to
retain
them
they
are
in
and
out
again
in
a
moment
the
world
says
what
a
pity
they
stick
to
nothing
but
the
fact
is
that
like
questing
wild
birds
they
seek
the
nest
they
need
it
is
a
question
of
values
they
judge
swiftly
change
their
line
of
flight
are
gone
not
even
hearing
the
comment
that
they
might
have
retired
with
a
and
to
this
homeless
questing
type
george
isley
certainly
belonged
he
was
by
no
means
shiftless
he
merely
sought
with
insatiable
yearning
that
soft
particular
nest
where
he
could
settle
down
in
permanently
and
to
an
accompaniment
of
sighs
and
regrets
from
his
friends
he
found
it
he
found
it
however
not
in
the
present
but
by
retiring
from
the
world
without
a
pension
unclothed
with
honours
and
distinctions
he
withdrew
from
the
present
and
slipped
softly
back
into
a
mighty
past
where
he
belonged
why
how
obeying
what
strange
instincts
this
remains
unknown
deep
secret
of
an
inner
life
that
found
no
in
modern
things
such
instincts
are
not
disclosable
in
language
nor
are
the
details
of
such
a
journey
properly
describable
at
all
except
by
the
few
poets
prophets
psychiatrists
and
the
like
such
experiences
are
dismissed
with
the
neat
museum
label
so
equally
must
the
recorder
of
this
experience
share
the
honour
of
that
little
label
he
who
by
chance
witnessed
certain
external
and
visible
signs
of
this
inner
and
spiritual
journey
there
remains
nevertheless
the
amazing
reality
of
the
experience
and
to
the
recorder
alone
was
some
clue
of
interpretation
possible
perhaps
because
in
himself
also
lay
the
lure
though
less
imperative
of
a
similar
journey
at
any
rate
the
interpretation
may
be
offered
to
the
handful
who
realise
that
trains
and
motors
are
not
the
only
means
of
travel
left
to
our
progressive
race
in
his
younger
days
i
knew
george
isley
intimately
i
know
him
now
but
the
george
isley
i
knew
of
old
the
arresting
personality
with
whom
i
travelled
climbed
explored
is
no
longer
with
us
he
is
not
here
he
disappeared
gradually
into
the
past
there
is
no
george
isley
and
that
such
an
individuality
could
vanish
while
still
his
outer
semblance
walks
the
familiar
streets
normal
apparently
and
not
yet
fifty
in
the
number
of
his
years
seems
a
tale
though
difficult
well
worth
the
telling
for
i
witnessed
the
slow
submergence
it
was
very
gradual
i
can
not
pretend
to
understand
the
entire
significance
of
it
there
was
something
questionable
and
sinister
in
the
business
that
offered
hints
of
astonishing
possibilities
were
there
a
corps
of
spiritual
police
the
matter
might
be
partially
cleared
up
but
since
none
of
the
churches
have
yet
organised
anything
effective
of
this
sort
one
can
only
fall
back
upon
variants
of
the
blessed
mesopotamia
and
whisper
of
derangement
and
the
like
such
labels
of
course
explain
as
little
as
most
other
in
life
that
soldierly
figure
strolling
down
piccadilly
watching
the
races
dining
out
there
is
no
derangement
there
the
face
is
not
melancholy
the
eye
not
wild
the
gestures
are
quiet
and
the
speech
controlled
yet
the
eye
is
empty
the
face
expressionless
vacancy
reigns
there
provocative
and
significant
if
not
unduly
noticeable
it
is
because
the
majority
in
life
neither
expect
nor
offer
more
at
closer
quarters
you
may
think
questioning
things
or
you
may
think
nothing
probably
the
latter
you
may
wonder
why
something
continually
expected
does
not
make
its
appearance
and
you
may
watch
for
the
evidence
of
personality
the
general
presentment
of
the
man
has
led
you
to
expect
disappointed
therefore
you
may
certainly
be
but
i
defy
you
to
discover
the
smallest
hint
of
mental
disorder
and
of
derangement
or
nervous
affliction
absolutely
nothing
before
long
perhaps
you
may
feel
you
are
talking
with
a
dummy
some
automaton
a
nonentity
devoid
of
spontaneous
life
and
afterwards
you
may
find
that
memory
fades
rapidly
away
as
though
no
impression
of
any
kind
has
really
been
made
at
all
all
this
yes
but
nothing
pathological
a
few
may
be
stimulated
by
this
startling
discrepancy
between
promise
and
performance
but
most
accustomed
to
accept
face
values
would
say
a
pleasant
fellow
but
nothing
in
him
much
and
an
hour
later
forget
him
altogether
for
the
truth
is
as
you
perhaps
divined
you
have
been
sitting
beside
no
one
you
have
been
talking
to
looking
at
listening
to
no
one
the
intercourse
has
conveyed
nothing
that
can
waken
human
response
in
you
good
bad
or
indifferent
there
is
no
george
isley
and
the
discovery
if
you
make
it
will
not
even
cause
you
to
creep
with
the
uncanniness
of
the
experience
because
the
exterior
is
so
wholly
pleasing
george
isley
is
a
picture
with
no
meaning
in
it
that
charms
merely
by
the
harmonious
colouring
of
an
inoffensive
subject
he
moves
undiscovered
in
the
little
world
of
society
to
which
he
was
born
secure
in
the
groove
first
habit
has
made
comfortably
automatic
for
him
no
one
guesses
none
that
is
but
the
few
who
knew
him
intimately
in
early
life
and
his
wandering
existence
has
scattered
these
they
have
forgotten
what
he
was
so
perfect
indeed
is
he
in
the
manners
of
the
commonplace
fashionable
man
that
no
woman
in
his
set
is
aware
that
he
differs
from
the
type
she
is
accustomed
to
he
turns
a
compliment
with
the
accepted
language
of
her
motors
golfs
and
gambles
in
the
regulation
manner
of
his
particular
world
he
is
an
admirable
perfect
automaton
he
is
nothing
he
is
a
human
shell
ii
the
name
of
george
isley
had
been
before
the
public
for
some
years
when
after
a
considerable
interval
we
met
again
in
a
hotel
in
egypt
i
for
my
health
he
for
i
knew
not
what
at
first
but
i
soon
discovered
archaeology
and
excavation
had
taken
hold
of
him
though
he
had
gone
so
quietly
about
it
that
no
one
seemed
to
have
heard
i
was
not
sure
that
he
was
glad
to
see
me
for
he
had
first
withdrawn
annoyed
it
seemed
at
being
discovered
but
later
as
though
after
consideration
had
made
tentative
advances
he
welcomed
me
with
a
curious
gesture
of
the
entire
body
that
seemed
to
shake
himself
free
from
something
that
had
made
him
forget
my
identity
there
was
pathos
somewhere
in
his
attitude
almost
as
though
he
asked
for
sympathy
i
ve
been
out
here
off
and
on
for
the
last
three
years
he
told
me
after
describing
something
of
what
he
had
been
doing
i
find
it
the
most
repaying
hobby
in
the
world
it
leads
to
a
reconstruction
an
imaginative
reconstruction
of
course
i
mean
of
an
enormous
thing
the
world
had
entirely
lost
a
very
gorgeous
stimulating
hobby
believe
me
and
a
very
entic
he
quickly
changed
the
word
exacting
one
i
remember
looking
him
up
and
down
with
astonishment
there
was
a
change
in
him
a
lack
a
note
was
missing
in
his
enthusiasm
a
colour
in
the
voice
a
quality
in
his
manner
the
ingredients
were
not
mixed
quite
as
of
old
i
did
not
bother
him
with
questions
but
i
noted
thus
at
the
very
first
a
subtle
alteration
another
facet
of
the
man
presented
itself
something
that
had
been
independent
and
aggressive
was
replaced
by
a
certain
emptiness
that
invited
sympathy
even
in
his
physical
appearance
the
change
was
manifested
this
odd
suggestion
of
lessening
i
looked
again
more
closely
lessening
was
the
word
he
had
somehow
dwindled
it
was
startling
vaguely
unpleasant
too
the
entire
subject
as
usual
was
at
his
he
knew
all
the
important
men
and
had
spent
money
freely
on
his
hobby
i
laughed
reminding
him
of
his
remark
that
egypt
had
no
attractions
for
him
owing
to
the
organised
advertisement
of
its
somewhat
theatrical
charms
admitting
his
error
with
a
gesture
he
brushed
the
objection
easily
aside
his
manner
and
a
certain
glow
that
rose
about
his
atmosphere
as
he
answered
increased
my
first
astonishment
his
voice
was
significant
and
suggestive
come
out
with
me
he
said
in
a
low
tone
and
see
how
little
the
tourists
matter
how
inappreciable
the
excavation
is
compared
to
what
remains
to
be
done
how
gigantic
he
emphasised
the
word
impressively
the
scope
for
discovery
he
made
a
movement
with
his
head
and
shoulders
that
conveyed
a
sense
of
the
prodigious
for
he
was
of
massive
build
his
cast
of
features
stern
and
his
eyes
set
deep
into
the
face
shone
past
me
with
a
sombre
gleam
in
them
i
did
not
quite
account
for
it
was
the
voice
however
that
brought
the
mystery
in
it
vibrated
somewhere
below
the
actual
sound
of
it
egypt
he
continued
and
so
gravely
that
at
first
i
made
the
mistake
of
thinking
he
chose
the
curious
words
on
purpose
to
produce
a
theatrical
effect
that
has
enriched
her
blood
with
the
pageant
of
so
many
civilisations
that
has
devoured
persians
greeks
and
romans
saracens
and
mamelukes
a
dozen
conquests
and
invasions
besides
what
can
mere
tourists
or
explorers
matter
to
her
the
excavators
scratch
their
skin
and
dig
up
mummies
and
as
for
tourists
he
laughed
contemptuously
flies
that
settle
for
a
moment
on
her
covered
face
to
vanish
at
the
first
signs
of
heat
egypt
is
not
even
aware
of
them
the
real
egypt
lies
underground
in
darkness
tourists
must
have
light
to
be
seen
as
well
as
to
see
and
the
diggers
he
paused
smiling
with
something
between
pity
and
contempt
i
did
not
quite
appreciate
for
personally
i
felt
a
great
respect
for
the
tireless
excavators
and
then
he
added
with
a
touch
of
feeling
in
his
tone
as
though
he
had
a
grievance
against
them
and
had
not
also
dug
himself
men
who
uncover
the
dead
restore
the
temples
and
reconstruct
a
skeleton
thinking
they
have
read
its
beating
heart
he
shrugged
his
great
shoulders
and
the
rest
of
the
sentence
may
have
been
but
the
protest
of
a
man
in
defence
of
his
own
hobby
but
that
there
seemed
an
undue
earnestness
and
gravity
about
it
that
made
me
wonder
more
than
ever
he
went
on
to
speak
of
the
strangeness
of
the
land
as
a
mere
ribbon
of
vegetation
along
the
ancient
river
the
rest
all
ruins
desert
wilderness
of
death
yet
so
breakingly
alive
with
wonder
power
and
a
certain
disquieting
sense
of
deathlessness
there
seemed
for
him
a
revelation
of
unusual
spiritual
kind
in
this
land
where
the
past
survived
so
potently
he
spoke
almost
as
though
it
obliterated
the
present
indeed
the
hint
of
something
solemn
behind
his
words
made
it
difficult
for
me
to
keep
up
the
conversation
and
the
pause
that
presently
came
i
filled
in
with
some
word
of
questioning
surprise
which
yet
i
think
was
chiefly
in
concurrence
i
was
aware
of
some
big
belief
in
him
some
enveloping
emotion
that
escaped
my
grasp
yet
though
i
did
not
understand
his
great
mood
swept
me
his
voice
lowered
then
as
he
went
on
to
mention
temples
tombs
and
deities
details
of
his
own
discoveries
and
of
their
effect
upon
him
but
to
this
i
listened
with
half
an
ear
because
in
the
unusual
language
he
had
first
made
use
of
i
detected
this
other
thing
that
stirred
my
curiosity
more
stirred
it
uncomfortably
then
the
spell
i
asked
remembering
the
effect
of
egypt
upon
myself
two
years
before
has
worked
upon
you
as
upon
most
others
only
with
greater
power
he
looked
hard
at
me
a
moment
signs
of
trouble
showing
themselves
faintly
in
his
rugged
interesting
face
i
think
he
wanted
to
say
more
than
he
could
bring
himself
to
confess
he
hesitated
i
m
only
glad
he
replied
after
a
pause
it
didn
t
get
hold
of
me
earlier
in
life
it
would
have
absorbed
me
i
should
have
lost
all
other
interests
now
that
curious
look
of
helplessness
of
asking
sympathy
flitted
like
a
shadow
through
his
eyes
now
that
i
m
on
the
decline
it
matters
on
the
decline
i
can
not
imagine
by
what
blundering
i
missed
this
chance
he
never
offered
again
somehow
or
other
the
singular
phrase
passed
unnoticed
at
the
moment
and
only
came
upon
me
with
its
full
significance
later
when
it
was
too
awkward
to
refer
to
it
he
tested
my
readiness
to
help
to
sympathise
to
share
his
inner
life
i
missed
the
clue
for
at
the
moment
a
more
practical
consideration
interested
me
in
his
language
being
of
those
who
regretted
that
he
had
not
excelled
by
devoting
his
powers
to
a
single
object
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
he
caught
my
meaning
instantly
oh
he
was
glad
to
talk
he
felt
the
possibility
of
my
sympathy
underneath
i
think
no
no
you
take
me
wrongly
there
he
said
with
gravity
what
i
mean
and
i
ought
to
know
if
any
one
does
is
that
while
most
countries
give
others
take
away
egypt
changes
you
no
one
can
live
here
and
remain
exactly
what
he
was
this
puzzled
me
it
startled
too
again
his
manner
was
so
earnest
and
egypt
you
mean
is
one
of
the
countries
that
take
away
i
asked
the
strange
idea
unsettled
my
thoughts
a
little
first
takes
away
from
you
he
replied
but
in
the
end
takes
away
some
lands
enrich
you
he
went
on
seeing
that
i
listened
while
others
impoverish
from
india
greece
italy
all
ancient
lands
you
return
with
memories
you
can
use
from
egypt
you
return
with
nothing
its
splendour
stupefies
it
s
useless
there
is
a
change
in
your
inmost
being
an
emptiness
an
unaccountable
yearning
but
you
find
nothing
that
can
fill
the
lack
you
re
conscious
of
nothing
comes
to
replace
what
has
gone
you
have
been
i
stared
but
i
nodded
a
general
acquiescence
of
a
sensitive
artistic
temperament
this
was
certainly
true
though
by
no
means
the
superficial
and
generally
accepted
verdict
the
majority
imagine
that
egypt
has
filled
them
to
the
brim
i
took
his
deeper
reading
of
the
facts
i
was
aware
of
an
odd
fascination
in
his
idea
modern
egypt
he
continued
is
after
all
but
a
trick
of
civilisation
and
there
was
a
kind
of
breathlessness
in
his
measured
tone
but
ancient
egypt
lies
waiting
hiding
underneath
though
dead
she
is
amazingly
alive
and
you
feel
her
touching
you
she
takes
from
you
she
enriches
herself
you
return
from
egypt
less
than
you
were
what
came
over
my
mind
is
hard
to
say
some
touch
of
visionary
imagination
burned
its
flaming
path
across
my
mind
i
thought
of
some
old
grecian
hero
speaking
of
his
delicious
battle
with
the
gods
battle
in
which
he
knew
he
must
be
worsted
but
yet
in
which
he
delighted
because
at
death
his
spirit
would
join
their
glorious
company
beyond
this
world
i
was
aware
that
is
to
say
of
resignation
as
well
as
resistance
in
him
he
already
felt
the
effortless
peace
which
follows
upon
long
unequal
battling
as
of
a
man
who
has
fought
the
rapids
with
a
strain
beyond
his
strength
then
sinks
back
and
goes
with
the
awful
mass
of
water
smoothly
and
indifferently
over
the
quiet
fall
yet
it
was
not
so
much
his
words
which
clothed
picturesquely
an
undeniable
truth
as
the
force
of
conviction
that
drove
behind
them
shrouding
my
mind
with
mystery
and
darkness
his
eyes
so
steadily
holding
mine
were
lit
i
admit
yet
they
were
calm
and
sane
as
those
of
a
doctor
discussing
the
symptoms
of
that
daily
battle
to
which
we
all
finally
succumb
this
analogy
occurred
to
me
there
i
stammered
a
little
faltering
in
my
speech
an
incalculable
element
in
the
country
somewhere
i
confess
you
put
it
rather
strongly
though
don
t
you
he
answered
quietly
moving
his
eyes
from
my
face
towards
the
window
that
framed
the
serene
and
exquisite
sky
towards
the
nile
the
real
invisible
egypt
he
murmured
i
do
find
rather
strong
i
find
it
difficult
to
deal
with
you
see
and
he
turned
towards
me
smiling
like
a
tired
child
i
think
the
truth
is
that
egypt
deals
with
it
draws
i
began
then
started
as
he
interrupted
me
at
once
into
the
he
uttered
the
little
word
in
a
way
beyond
me
to
describe
there
came
a
flood
of
glory
with
it
a
sense
of
peace
and
beauty
of
battles
over
and
of
rest
attained
no
saint
could
have
brimmed
heaven
with
as
much
passionately
enticing
meaning
he
went
willingly
prolonging
the
struggle
merely
to
enjoy
the
greater
relief
and
joy
of
the
consummation
for
again
he
spoke
as
though
a
struggle
were
in
progress
in
his
being
i
got
the
impression
that
he
somewhere
wanted
help
i
understood
the
pathetic
quality
i
had
vaguely
discerned
already
his
character
naturally
was
so
strong
and
independent
it
now
seemed
weaker
as
though
certain
fibres
had
been
drawn
out
and
i
understood
then
that
the
spell
of
egypt
so
lightly
chattered
about
in
its
sensational
aspect
so
rarely
known
in
its
naked
power
the
nameless
creeping
influence
that
begins
deep
below
the
surface
and
thence
sends
delicate
tendrils
outwards
was
in
his
blood
i
in
my
untaught
ignorance
had
felt
it
too
it
is
undeniable
one
is
aware
of
unaccountable
queer
things
in
egypt
even
the
utterly
prosaic
feel
them
dead
egypt
is
marvellously
alive
i
glanced
past
him
out
of
the
big
windows
where
the
desert
glimmered
in
its
featureless
expanse
of
yellow
leagues
two
monstrous
pyramids
signalling
from
across
the
nile
and
for
a
moment
inexplicably
it
seemed
to
me
afterwards
i
lost
sight
of
my
companion
s
stalwart
figure
that
was
yet
so
close
before
my
eyes
he
had
risen
from
his
chair
he
was
standing
near
me
yet
my
sight
missed
him
altogether
something
dim
as
a
shadow
faint
as
a
breath
of
air
rose
up
and
bore
my
thoughts
away
obliterating
vision
too
i
forgot
for
a
moment
who
i
was
identity
slipped
from
me
thought
sight
feeling
all
sank
away
into
the
emptiness
of
those
sands
sank
as
it
were
into
nothingness
caught
away
from
the
present
enticed
absorbed
and
when
i
looked
back
again
to
answer
him
or
rather
to
ask
what
his
curious
words
could
mean
he
was
no
longer
there
more
than
surprised
for
there
was
something
of
shock
in
the
disappearance
i
turned
to
search
i
had
not
seen
him
go
he
had
stolen
from
my
side
so
softly
slipped
away
silently
mysteriously
and
so
easily
i
remember
that
a
faint
shiver
ran
down
my
back
as
i
realised
that
i
was
alone
was
it
that
momentarily
i
had
caught
a
reflex
of
his
state
of
mind
had
my
sympathy
induced
in
myself
an
echo
of
what
he
experienced
in
full
a
going
backwards
a
loss
of
present
vigour
the
enticing
subtle
draw
of
those
immeasurable
sands
that
hide
the
living
dead
from
the
interruptions
of
the
careless
living
i
sat
down
to
reflect
and
incidentally
to
watch
the
magnificence
of
the
sunset
and
the
thing
he
had
said
returned
upon
me
with
insistent
power
ringing
like
distant
bells
within
my
mind
his
talk
of
the
tombs
and
temples
passed
but
this
remained
it
stimulated
oddly
his
talk
i
remembered
had
always
excited
curiosity
in
this
way
some
countries
give
while
others
take
away
what
did
he
mean
precisely
what
had
egypt
taken
away
from
him
and
i
realised
more
definitely
that
something
in
him
was
missing
something
he
possessed
in
former
years
that
was
now
no
longer
there
he
had
grown
shadowy
already
in
my
thoughts
the
mind
searched
keenly
but
in
vain
and
after
some
time
i
left
my
chair
and
moved
over
to
another
window
aware
that
a
vague
discomfort
stirred
within
me
that
involved
uneasiness
for
him
i
felt
pity
but
behind
the
pity
was
an
eager
absorbing
curiosity
as
well
he
seemed
receding
curiously
into
misty
distance
and
the
strong
desire
leaped
in
me
to
overtake
to
travel
with
him
into
some
vanished
splendour
that
he
had
rediscovered
the
feeling
was
a
most
remarkable
one
for
it
included
yearning
the
yearning
for
some
nameless
forgotten
loveliness
the
world
has
lost
it
was
in
me
too
at
the
approach
of
twilight
the
mind
loves
to
harbour
shadows
the
room
empty
of
guests
was
dark
behind
me
darkness
too
was
creeping
across
the
desert
like
a
veil
deepening
the
serenity
of
its
grim
unfeatured
face
it
turned
pale
with
distance
the
whole
great
sheet
of
it
went
rustling
into
night
the
first
stars
peeped
and
twinkled
hanging
loosely
in
the
air
as
though
they
could
be
plucked
like
golden
berries
and
the
sun
was
already
below
the
libyan
horizon
where
gold
and
crimson
faded
through
violet
into
blue
i
stood
watching
this
mysterious
egyptian
dusk
while
an
eerie
glamour
seemed
to
bring
the
incredible
within
uneasy
reach
of
the
senses
and
suddenly
the
truth
dropped
into
me
over
george
isley
over
his
mind
and
energies
over
his
thoughts
and
over
his
emotions
too
a
kind
of
darkness
was
also
slowly
creeping
something
in
him
had
dimmed
yet
not
with
age
it
had
gone
out
some
inner
night
stealing
over
the
present
obliterated
it
and
yet
he
looked
towards
the
dawn
like
the
egyptian
monuments
his
eyes
turned
eastwards
and
so
it
came
to
me
that
what
he
had
lost
was
personal
ambition
he
was
glad
he
said
that
these
egyptian
studies
had
not
caught
him
earlier
in
life
the
language
he
made
use
of
was
peculiar
now
i
am
on
the
decline
it
matters
a
slight
foundation
no
doubt
to
build
conviction
on
and
yet
i
felt
sure
that
i
was
partly
right
he
was
fascinated
but
fascinated
against
his
will
the
present
in
him
battled
against
the
past
still
fighting
he
had
yet
lost
hope
the
desire
to
change
was
now
no
longer
in
him
i
turned
away
from
the
window
so
as
not
to
see
that
grey
encroaching
desert
for
the
discovery
produced
a
certain
agitation
in
me
egypt
seemed
suddenly
a
living
entity
of
enormous
power
she
stirred
about
me
she
was
stirring
now
this
flat
and
motionless
land
pretending
it
had
no
movement
was
actually
busy
with
a
million
gestures
that
came
creeping
round
the
heart
she
was
reducing
him
already
from
the
complex
texture
of
his
personality
she
had
drawn
one
vital
thread
that
in
its
relation
to
the
general
woof
was
of
central
importance
ambition
the
mind
chose
the
simile
but
in
my
heart
where
thought
fluttered
in
singular
distress
another
suggested
itself
as
truer
thread
changed
to
i
turned
quickly
and
went
up
to
my
room
where
i
could
be
alone
the
idea
was
somewhere
ghastly
iii
yet
while
dressing
for
dinner
the
idea
exfoliated
as
only
a
living
thing
exfoliates
i
saw
in
george
isley
this
great
question
mark
that
had
not
been
there
formerly
all
have
of
course
some
question
mark
and
carry
it
about
though
with
most
it
rarely
becomes
visible
until
the
end
with
him
it
was
plainly
visible
in
his
atmosphere
at
the
of
his
life
he
wore
it
like
a
fine
curved
scimitar
above
his
head
so
full
of
life
he
yet
seemed
willingly
dead
for
though
imagination
sought
every
possible
explanation
i
got
no
further
than
the
somewhat
negative
result
that
a
certain
energy
wholly
unconnected
with
mere
physical
health
had
been
withdrawn
it
was
more
than
ambition
i
think
for
it
included
intention
desire
as
well
it
was
life
itself
he
was
no
longer
in
the
present
he
was
no
longer
some
countries
give
while
others
take
away
i
find
egypt
difficult
to
deal
with
i
find
it
and
then
that
simple
uncomplex
adjective
in
memory
and
experience
the
entire
globe
was
mapped
for
him
it
remained
for
egypt
then
to
teach
him
this
marvellous
new
thing
but
not
egypt
of
it
was
vanished
egypt
that
had
robbed
him
of
his
strength
he
had
described
it
as
underground
hidden
waiting
i
was
again
aware
of
a
faint
shuddering
as
though
something
crept
secretly
from
my
inmost
heart
to
share
the
experience
with
him
and
as
though
my
sympathy
involved
a
willing
consent
that
this
should
be
so
with
sympathy
there
must
always
be
a
shedding
of
the
personal
self
each
time
i
felt
this
sympathy
it
seemed
that
something
left
me
i
thought
in
circles
arriving
at
no
definite
point
where
i
could
rest
and
say
that
s
it
i
the
giving
attitude
of
a
country
was
easily
comprehensible
but
this
idea
of
robbery
of
deprivation
baffled
me
an
obscure
alarm
took
hold
of
me
for
myself
as
well
as
for
him
at
dinner
where
he
invited
me
to
his
table
the
impression
passed
off
a
good
deal
however
and
i
convicted
myself
of
a
woman
s
exaggeration
yet
as
we
talked
of
many
a
day
s
adventure
together
in
other
lands
it
struck
me
that
we
oddly
left
the
present
out
we
ignored
his
thoughts
as
it
were
went
most
easily
backwards
and
each
adventure
led
as
by
its
own
natural
weight
and
impetus
towards
one
thing
the
enormous
glory
of
a
vanished
age
ancient
egypt
was
home
in
this
mysterious
game
life
played
with
death
the
specific
gravity
of
his
being
to
say
nothing
for
the
moment
of
my
own
had
shifted
lower
farther
off
backwards
and
below
or
as
he
put
it
underground
the
sinking
sensation
i
experienced
was
of
a
literal
kind
and
so
i
found
myself
wondering
what
had
led
him
to
this
particular
hotel
i
had
come
out
with
an
affected
organ
the
specialist
promised
me
would
heal
in
the
marvellous
air
of
helouan
but
it
was
queer
that
my
companion
also
should
have
chosen
it
its
was
mostly
invalid
german
and
russian
invalid
at
that
the
management
set
its
face
against
the
lighter
gayer
side
of
life
that
hotels
in
egypt
usually
encourage
eagerly
it
was
a
true
a
place
of
repose
and
leisure
a
place
where
one
could
remain
undiscovered
and
unknown
no
english
patronised
it
one
might
easily
the
idea
came
unbidden
suddenly
hide
in
it
then
you
re
doing
nothing
just
now
i
asked
in
the
way
of
digging
no
big
expeditions
or
excavating
at
the
moment
i
m
recuperating
he
answered
carelessly
i
ve
have
had
two
years
up
at
the
valley
of
the
kings
and
overdid
it
rather
but
i
m
by
way
of
working
at
a
little
thing
near
here
across
the
and
he
pointed
in
the
direction
of
sakkhâra
where
the
huge
memphian
cemetery
stretches
underground
from
the
dachûr
pyramids
to
the
gizeh
monsters
four
miles
lower
down
there
s
a
matter
of
a
hundred
years
in
that
alone
you
must
have
accumulated
a
mass
of
interesting
material
i
suppose
later
you
ll
make
use
of
it
a
book
or
his
expression
stopped
me
that
strange
look
in
the
eyes
that
had
stirred
my
first
uneasiness
it
was
as
if
something
struggled
up
a
moment
looked
bleakly
out
upon
the
present
then
sank
away
again
more
he
answered
listlessly
than
i
can
ever
use
it
s
much
more
likely
to
use
he
said
it
hurriedly
looking
over
his
shoulder
as
though
some
one
might
be
listening
then
smiled
significantly
bringing
his
eyes
back
upon
my
own
again
i
told
him
that
he
was
far
too
modest
if
all
the
excavators
thought
like
that
i
added
we
ignorant
ones
should
i
laughed
but
the
laughter
was
only
on
my
lips
he
shook
his
head
indifferently
they
do
their
best
they
do
wonders
he
replied
making
an
indescribable
gesture
as
though
he
withdrew
willingly
from
the
topic
altogether
yet
could
not
quite
achieve
it
i
know
their
books
i
know
the
writers
too
of
various
he
paused
a
moment
and
his
eyes
turned
grave
i
can
not
understand
quite
how
they
do
it
he
added
half
below
his
breath
the
labour
you
mean
the
strain
of
the
climate
and
so
forth
i
said
this
purposely
for
i
knew
quite
well
he
meant
another
thing
the
way
he
looked
into
my
face
however
disturbed
me
so
that
i
believe
i
visibly
started
something
very
deep
in
me
sat
up
alertly
listening
almost
on
guard
i
mean
he
replied
that
they
must
have
uncommon
powers
of
there
he
had
used
the
very
word
that
had
been
hiding
in
me
it
puzzles
me
he
went
on
for
with
one
exception
they
are
not
unusual
men
in
the
way
of
gifts
oh
yes
it
s
in
the
way
of
resistance
and
protection
that
i
mean
he
added
with
emphasis
it
was
the
way
he
said
resistance
and
that
sent
a
touch
of
cold
through
me
i
learned
later
that
he
himself
had
made
surprising
discoveries
in
these
two
years
penetrating
closer
to
the
secret
life
of
ancient
sacerdotal
egypt
than
any
of
his
predecessors
or
then
inexplicably
had
ceased
but
this
was
told
to
me
afterwards
and
by
others
at
the
moment
i
was
only
conscious
of
this
odd
embarrassment
i
did
not
understand
yet
felt
that
he
touched
upon
something
intimately
personal
to
himself
he
paused
expecting
me
to
speak
egypt
perhaps
merely
pours
through
them
i
ventured
they
give
out
mechanically
hardly
realising
how
much
they
give
they
report
facts
devoid
of
interpretation
whereas
with
you
it
s
the
actual
spirit
of
the
past
that
is
discovered
and
laid
bare
you
live
it
you
feel
old
egypt
and
disclose
her
that
divining
faculty
was
always
yours
uncannily
i
used
to
the
flash
of
his
sombre
eyes
betrayed
that
my
aim
was
singularly
good
it
seemed
a
third
had
silently
joined
our
little
table
in
the
corner
something
intruded
evoked
by
the
power
of
what
our
conversation
skirted
but
ever
left
unmentioned
it
was
huge
and
shadowy
it
was
also
watchful
egypt
came
gliding
floating
up
beside
us
i
saw
her
reflected
in
his
face
and
gaze
the
desert
slipped
in
through
walls
and
ceiling
rising
from
beneath
our
feet
settling
about
us
listening
peering
waiting
the
strange
obsession
was
sudden
and
complete
the
gigantic
scale
of
her
swam
in
among
the
very
pillars
arches
and
windows
of
that
modern
i
felt
against
my
skin
the
touch
of
chilly
air
that
sunlight
never
reaches
stealing
from
beneath
the
granite
monoliths
behind
it
came
the
stifling
breath
of
the
heated
tombs
of
the
serapeum
of
the
chambers
and
corridors
in
the
pyramids
there
was
a
rustling
as
of
myriad
footsteps
far
away
and
as
of
sand
the
busy
winds
go
shifting
through
the
ages
and
in
startling
contrast
to
this
impression
of
prodigious
size
isley
himself
wore
suddenly
an
air
of
strangely
dwindling
for
a
second
he
shrank
visibly
before
my
very
eyes
he
was
receding
his
outline
seemed
to
retreat
and
lessen
as
though
he
stood
to
the
waist
in
what
appeared
like
flowing
mist
only
his
head
and
shoulders
still
above
the
ground
far
far
away
i
saw
him
it
was
a
vivid
inner
picture
that
i
somehow
transferred
objectively
it
was
a
dramatised
sensation
of
course
his
former
phrase
now
that
i
am
declining
flashed
back
upon
me
with
sharp
discomfort
again
perhaps
his
state
of
mind
was
reflected
into
me
by
some
emotional
telepathy
i
waited
conscious
of
an
almost
sensible
oppression
that
would
not
lift
it
seemed
an
age
before
he
spoke
and
when
he
did
there
was
the
tremor
of
feeling
in
his
voice
he
sought
nevertheless
to
repress
i
kept
my
eyes
on
the
table
for
some
reason
but
i
listened
intently
it
s
you
that
have
the
divining
faculty
not
i
he
said
an
odd
note
of
distance
even
in
his
tone
yet
a
resonance
as
though
it
rose
up
between
reverberating
walls
there
i
believe
something
here
that
resents
too
close
inquiry
or
rather
that
resists
discovery
almost
takes
i
looked
up
quickly
then
looked
down
again
it
was
such
a
startling
thing
to
hear
on
the
lips
of
a
modern
englishman
he
spoke
lightly
but
the
expression
of
his
face
belied
the
careless
tone
there
was
no
mockery
in
those
earnest
eyes
and
in
the
hushed
voice
was
a
little
creeping
sound
that
gave
me
once
again
the
touch
of
the
only
word
i
can
find
is
subterranean
all
that
was
mental
in
him
had
sunk
so
that
he
seemed
speaking
underground
head
and
shoulders
alone
visible
the
effect
was
almost
ghastly
such
extraordinary
obstacles
are
put
in
one
s
way
he
went
on
when
the
prying
gets
too
close
to
the
reality
physical
external
obstacles
i
mean
either
that
or
the
mind
loses
its
assimilative
faculties
one
or
other
happens
his
voice
died
down
into
a
whisper
and
discovery
ceases
of
its
own
the
same
minute
then
he
suddenly
raised
himself
like
a
man
emerging
from
a
tomb
he
leaned
across
the
table
he
made
an
effort
of
some
violent
internal
kind
on
the
verge
i
fully
believe
of
a
pregnant
personal
statement
there
was
confession
in
his
attitude
i
think
he
was
about
to
speak
of
his
work
at
thebes
and
the
reason
for
its
abrupt
cessation
for
i
had
the
feeling
of
one
about
to
hear
a
weighty
secret
the
responsibility
unwelcome
this
uncomfortable
emotion
rose
in
me
as
i
raised
my
eyes
to
his
somewhat
unwillingly
only
to
find
that
i
was
wholly
at
fault
it
was
not
me
he
was
looking
at
he
was
staring
past
me
in
the
direction
of
the
wide
unshuttered
windows
the
expression
of
yearning
was
visible
in
his
eyes
again
something
had
stopped
his
utterance
and
instinctively
i
turned
and
saw
what
he
saw
so
far
as
external
details
were
concerned
at
least
i
saw
it
across
the
glare
and
glitter
of
the
uncompromising
modern
past
crowded
tables
and
over
the
heads
of
germans
feeding
unpicturesquely
i
saw
the
moon
her
reddish
disc
hanging
unreal
and
enormous
lifted
the
spread
sheet
of
desert
till
it
floated
off
the
surface
of
the
world
the
great
window
faced
the
east
where
the
arabian
desert
breaks
into
a
ruin
of
gorges
cliffs
and
ridges
it
looked
unfriendly
ominous
with
danger
in
it
unlike
the
serener
of
the
libyan
desert
there
lay
both
menace
and
seduction
behind
its
flood
of
shadows
and
the
moonlight
emphasised
this
aspect
its
ghostly
desolation
its
cruelty
its
bleak
hostility
turning
it
murderous
for
no
river
sweetens
this
arabian
desert
instead
of
sandy
softness
it
has
fangs
of
limestone
rock
sharp
and
aggressive
across
it
just
visible
in
the
moonlight
as
a
thread
of
paler
grey
the
old
to
suez
beckoned
faintly
and
it
was
this
that
he
was
looking
at
so
intently
it
was
i
know
a
theatrical
glimpse
yet
in
it
a
seductiveness
most
potent
come
out
it
seemed
to
whisper
and
taste
my
awful
beauty
come
out
and
lose
yourself
and
die
come
out
and
follow
my
moonlit
trail
into
the
past
where
there
is
peace
and
immobility
and
silence
my
kingdom
is
unchanging
underground
come
down
come
softly
come
through
sandy
corridors
below
this
tinsel
of
your
modern
world
come
back
come
down
into
my
golden
past
a
poignant
desire
stole
through
my
heart
on
moonlit
feet
i
was
personally
conscious
of
a
keen
yearning
to
slip
away
in
unresisting
obedience
for
it
was
uncommonly
impressive
this
sudden
haunting
glimpse
of
the
world
outside
the
hairy
foreigners
uncouthly
garbed
all
busily
eating
in
full
electric
light
provided
a
sensational
contrast
of
emphatically
distressing
kind
a
touch
of
what
is
called
unearthly
hovered
about
that
distance
through
the
window
there
was
weirdness
in
it
egypt
looked
in
upon
us
egypt
watched
and
listened
beckoning
through
the
moonlit
windows
of
the
heart
to
come
and
find
her
mind
and
imagination
might
flounder
as
they
pleased
but
something
of
this
kind
happened
undeniably
whether
expression
in
language
fails
to
hold
the
truth
or
not
and
george
isley
aware
of
being
seen
looked
straight
into
the
awful
visage
fascinated
over
the
bronze
of
his
skin
there
stole
a
shade
of
grey
my
own
feeling
of
enticement
grew
the
desire
to
go
out
into
the
moonlight
to
leave
my
kind
and
wander
blindly
through
the
desert
to
see
the
gorges
in
their
shining
silver
and
taste
the
keenness
of
the
cool
sharp
air
further
than
this
with
me
it
did
not
go
but
that
my
companion
felt
the
bigger
deeper
draw
behind
this
surface
glamour
i
have
no
reasonable
doubt
for
a
moment
indeed
i
thought
he
meant
to
leave
the
table
he
had
half
risen
in
his
chair
it
seemed
he
struggled
and
resisted
and
then
his
big
frame
subsided
again
he
sat
back
he
looked
in
the
attitude
his
body
took
less
impressive
smaller
actually
shrunken
into
the
proportions
of
some
minuter
scale
it
was
as
though
something
in
that
second
had
been
drawn
out
of
him
decreasing
even
his
physical
appearance
the
voice
when
he
spoke
presently
with
a
touch
of
resignation
held
a
lifeless
quality
as
though
deprived
of
virile
timbre
it
s
always
there
he
whispered
half
collapsing
back
into
his
chair
it
s
always
watching
waiting
listening
almost
like
a
monster
of
the
fables
isn
t
it
it
makes
no
movement
of
its
own
you
see
it
s
far
too
strong
for
that
it
just
hangs
there
half
in
the
air
and
half
upon
the
earth
a
gigantic
web
its
prey
flies
into
it
that
s
egypt
all
over
d
you
feel
like
that
too
or
does
it
seem
to
you
just
imaginative
rubbish
to
me
it
seems
that
she
just
waits
her
time
she
gets
you
quicker
that
way
in
the
end
you
re
bound
to
there
s
power
certainly
i
said
after
a
moment
s
pause
to
collect
my
wits
my
distress
increased
by
the
morbidness
of
his
simile
for
some
minds
there
may
be
a
kind
of
terror
too
for
weak
temperaments
that
are
all
my
thoughts
were
scattered
and
i
could
not
readily
find
good
words
there
is
startling
grandeur
in
a
sight
like
that
for
instance
and
i
pointed
to
the
window
you
feel
drawn
as
if
you
simply
to
my
mind
still
buzzed
with
his
curious
words
in
the
end
you
re
bound
to
it
betrayed
his
heart
and
soul
i
suppose
a
fly
does
feel
drawn
i
added
or
a
moth
to
the
destroying
flame
or
is
it
just
unconscious
on
their
part
he
jerked
his
big
head
significantly
well
well
he
answered
but
the
fly
isn
t
necessarily
weak
or
the
moth
misguided
perhaps
yet
both
obedient
to
the
laws
of
their
respective
beings
they
get
warnings
too
only
when
the
moth
wants
to
know
too
much
the
fire
stops
it
both
flame
and
spider
enrich
themselves
by
understanding
the
natures
of
their
prey
and
fly
and
moth
return
again
and
again
until
this
is
yet
george
isley
was
as
sane
as
the
head
waiter
who
noticing
our
interest
in
the
window
came
up
just
then
and
enquired
whether
we
felt
a
draught
and
would
prefer
it
closed
isley
i
realised
was
struggling
to
express
a
passionate
state
of
soul
for
which
owing
to
its
rarity
no
adequate
expression
lies
at
hand
there
is
a
language
of
the
mind
but
there
is
none
as
yet
of
the
spirit
i
felt
ill
at
ease
all
this
was
so
foreign
to
the
wholesome
strenuous
personality
of
the
man
as
i
remembered
it
but
my
dear
fellow
i
stammered
aren
t
you
giving
poor
old
egypt
a
bad
name
she
hardly
deserves
i
feel
only
the
amazing
strength
and
beauty
of
it
awe
if
you
like
but
none
of
this
resentment
you
so
mysteriously
hint
you
understand
for
all
that
he
answered
quietly
and
again
he
seemed
on
the
verge
of
some
significant
confession
that
might
ease
his
soul
my
uncomfortable
emotion
grew
certainly
he
was
at
high
pressure
somewhere
and
if
necessary
you
could
help
your
sympathy
i
mean
a
help
he
said
it
half
to
himself
and
in
a
suddenly
lowered
tone
again
a
help
i
gasped
my
sympathy
of
course
if
a
witness
he
murmured
not
looking
at
me
some
one
who
understands
yet
does
not
think
me
there
was
such
appeal
in
his
voice
that
i
felt
ready
and
eager
to
do
anything
to
help
him
our
eyes
met
and
my
own
tried
to
express
this
willingness
in
me
but
what
i
said
i
hardly
know
for
a
cloud
of
confusion
was
on
my
mind
and
my
speech
went
fumbling
like
a
schoolboy
s
i
was
more
than
disconcerted
through
this
bewilderment
then
i
just
caught
the
of
another
sentence
in
which
the
words
relief
it
is
to
have
some
one
to
hold
to
when
the
disappearance
comes
sounded
like
voices
heard
in
dream
but
i
missed
the
complete
phrase
and
shrank
from
asking
him
to
repeat
it
some
sympathetic
answer
struggled
to
my
lips
though
what
it
was
i
know
not
the
thing
i
murmured
however
seemed
apparently
well
chosen
he
leaned
across
and
laid
his
big
hand
a
moment
on
my
own
with
eloquent
pressure
it
was
cold
as
ice
a
look
of
gratitude
passed
over
his
sunburned
features
he
sighed
and
we
left
the
table
then
and
passed
into
the
inner
for
coffee
a
room
whose
windows
gave
upon
columned
terraces
that
allowed
no
view
of
the
encircling
desert
he
led
the
conversation
into
channels
less
personal
and
thank
heaven
less
intensely
emotional
and
mysterious
what
we
talked
about
i
now
forget
it
was
interesting
but
in
another
key
altogether
his
old
charm
and
power
worked
the
respect
i
had
always
felt
for
his
character
and
gifts
returned
in
force
but
it
was
the
pity
i
now
experienced
that
remained
chiefly
in
my
mind
for
this
change
in
him
became
more
and
more
noticeable
he
was
less
impressive
less
convincing
less
suggestive
his
talk
though
so
knowledgeable
lacked
that
spiritual
quality
that
drives
home
he
was
uncannily
less
and
i
went
up
to
bed
uneasy
and
disturbed
it
is
not
age
i
said
to
myself
and
assuredly
it
is
not
death
he
fears
although
he
spoke
of
disappearance
it
is
mental
in
the
deepest
sense
it
is
what
religious
people
would
call
soul
something
is
happening
to
his
iv
and
this
word
soul
remained
with
me
to
the
end
egypt
was
taking
his
soul
away
into
the
past
what
was
of
value
in
him
went
willingly
the
rest
some
lesser
aspect
of
his
mind
and
character
resisted
holding
to
the
present
a
struggle
therefore
was
involved
but
this
was
being
gradually
obliterated
too
how
i
arrived
gaily
at
this
monstrous
conclusion
seems
to
me
now
a
mystery
but
the
truth
is
that
from
a
conversation
one
brings
away
a
general
idea
that
is
larger
than
the
words
actually
heard
and
spoken
i
have
reported
naturally
but
a
fragment
of
what
passed
between
us
in
language
and
of
what
was
suggested
by
gesture
expression
silence
merely
perhaps
a
hint
i
can
only
assert
that
this
troubling
verdict
remained
a
conviction
in
my
mind
it
came
upstairs
with
me
it
watched
and
listened
by
my
side
that
mysterious
third
evoked
in
our
conversation
was
bigger
than
either
of
us
separately
it
might
be
called
the
spirit
of
ancient
egypt
or
it
might
be
called
with
equal
generalisation
the
past
this
third
at
any
rate
stood
by
me
whispering
this
astounding
thing
i
went
out
on
to
my
little
balcony
to
smoke
a
pipe
and
enjoy
the
comforting
presence
of
the
stars
before
turning
in
it
came
out
with
me
it
was
everywhere
i
heard
the
barking
of
dogs
the
monotonous
beating
of
a
distant
drum
towards
bedraschien
the
voices
of
the
natives
in
their
booths
and
down
the
streets
i
was
aware
of
this
invisible
third
behind
all
these
familiar
sounds
the
enormous
drowned
in
stars
conveyed
it
too
it
was
in
the
breath
of
chilly
wind
that
whispered
round
the
walls
and
it
brooded
everywhere
above
the
sleepless
desert
i
was
alone
as
little
as
though
george
isley
stood
beside
me
in
person
and
at
that
moment
a
moving
figure
caught
my
eye
below
my
window
was
on
the
sixth
story
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
tall
and
soldierly
bearing
of
the
man
who
was
strolling
past
the
hotel
george
isley
was
going
slowly
out
into
the
desert
there
was
actually
nothing
unusual
in
the
sight
it
was
only
ten
o
clock
but
for
doctor
s
orders
i
might
have
been
doing
the
same
myself
yet
as
i
leaned
over
the
dizzy
ledge
and
watched
him
a
chill
struck
through
me
and
a
feeling
nothing
could
justify
nor
pages
of
writing
describe
rose
up
and
mastered
me
his
words
at
dinner
came
back
with
curious
force
egypt
lay
round
him
motionless
a
vast
grey
web
his
feet
were
caught
in
it
it
quivered
the
silvery
meshes
in
the
moonlight
announced
the
fact
from
memphis
up
to
thebes
across
the
nile
from
underground
sakkhâra
to
the
valley
of
the
kings
a
tremor
ran
over
the
entire
desert
and
again
as
in
the
the
leagues
of
sand
went
rustling
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
caught
him
in
the
act
of
disappearing
i
realised
in
that
moment
the
haunting
power
of
this
mysterious
still
atmosphere
which
is
egypt
and
some
magical
emanation
of
its
mighty
past
broke
over
me
suddenly
like
a
wave
perhaps
in
that
moment
i
felt
what
he
himself
felt
the
withdrawing
suction
of
the
huge
spent
wave
swept
something
out
of
me
into
the
past
with
it
an
indescribable
yearning
drew
something
living
from
my
heart
something
that
longed
with
a
kind
of
burning
searching
sweetness
for
a
glory
of
spiritual
passion
that
was
gone
the
pain
and
happiness
of
it
were
more
poignant
than
may
be
told
and
my
present
personality
some
vital
portion
of
it
at
any
rate
wilted
before
the
power
of
its
enticement
i
stood
there
motionless
as
stone
and
stared
erect
and
steady
knowing
resistance
vain
eager
to
go
yet
striving
to
remain
and
half
with
an
air
of
floating
off
the
ground
he
went
towards
the
pale
grey
thread
which
was
the
track
to
suez
and
the
far
red
sea
there
came
upon
me
this
strange
deep
sense
of
pity
pathos
sympathy
that
was
beyond
all
explanation
and
mysterious
as
a
pain
in
dreams
for
a
sense
of
his
awful
loneliness
stole
into
me
a
loneliness
nothing
on
this
earth
could
possibly
relieve
robbed
of
the
present
he
sought
this
chimera
of
his
soul
an
unreal
past
not
even
the
calm
majesty
of
this
exquisite
egyptian
night
could
soothe
the
dream
away
the
peace
and
silence
were
marvellous
the
sweet
perfume
of
the
desert
air
intoxicating
but
all
these
intensified
it
only
and
though
at
a
loss
to
explain
my
own
emotion
its
poignancy
was
so
real
that
a
sigh
escaped
me
and
i
felt
that
tears
lay
not
too
far
away
i
watched
him
yet
felt
i
had
no
right
to
watch
softly
i
drew
back
from
the
window
with
the
sensation
of
eavesdropping
upon
his
privacy
but
before
i
did
so
i
had
seen
his
outline
melt
away
into
the
dim
world
of
sand
that
began
at
the
very
walls
of
the
hotel
he
wore
a
cloak
of
green
that
reached
down
almost
to
his
heels
and
its
colour
blended
with
the
silvery
surface
of
the
desert
s
dark
this
sheen
first
draped
and
then
concealed
him
it
covered
him
with
a
fold
of
its
mysterious
garment
that
without
seam
or
binding
veiled
egypt
for
a
thousand
leagues
the
desert
took
him
egypt
caught
him
in
her
web
he
was
gone
sleep
for
me
just
then
seemed
out
of
the
question
the
change
in
made
me
feel
less
sure
of
myself
to
see
him
thus
invertebrate
shocked
me
i
was
aware
that
i
had
nerves
for
a
long
time
i
sat
smoking
by
the
window
my
body
weary
but
my
imagination
irritatingly
stimulated
the
big
of
the
hotel
went
out
window
after
window
closed
below
me
the
electric
standards
in
the
streets
were
already
extinguished
and
helouan
looked
like
a
child
s
white
blocks
scattered
in
ruin
upon
the
nursery
carpet
it
seemed
so
wee
upon
the
vast
expanse
it
lay
in
a
twinkling
pattern
like
a
cluster
of
dropped
into
a
negligible
crease
of
the
tremendous
desert
it
peeped
up
at
the
stars
a
little
frightened
the
night
was
very
still
there
hung
an
enormous
brooding
beauty
everywhere
a
hint
of
the
sinister
in
it
that
only
the
brilliance
of
the
blazing
stars
relieved
nothing
really
slept
grouped
here
and
there
at
intervals
about
this
world
stood
the
everlasting
watchers
in
solemn
tireless
guardianship
the
soaring
pyramids
the
sphinx
the
grim
colossi
the
empty
temples
the
tombs
the
mind
was
aware
of
them
stationed
like
sentries
through
the
night
this
is
egypt
you
are
actually
in
egypt
whispered
the
silence
eight
thousand
years
of
history
lie
fluttering
outside
your
window
lies
there
underground
sleepless
mighty
deathless
not
to
be
trifled
with
beware
or
she
will
change
you
too
my
imagination
offered
this
hint
egypt
difficult
to
realise
it
remains
outside
the
mind
a
fabulous
idea
so
many
enormous
elements
together
refuse
to
be
assimilated
the
heart
pauses
asking
for
time
and
breath
the
senses
reel
a
little
and
in
the
end
a
mental
torpor
akin
to
stupefaction
creeps
upon
the
brain
with
a
sigh
the
struggle
is
abandoned
and
the
mind
surrenders
to
egypt
on
her
own
terms
alone
the
diggers
and
archaeologists
confined
to
definite
facts
offer
successful
resistance
my
friend
s
use
of
the
words
resistance
and
protection
became
clearer
to
me
while
logic
halted
intuition
fluttered
round
this
clue
to
the
solution
of
the
influences
at
work
george
isley
realised
egypt
more
than
most
but
as
she
had
been
and
i
recalled
its
first
effect
upon
myself
and
how
my
mind
had
been
unable
to
cope
with
the
memory
of
it
afterwards
there
had
come
to
its
summons
a
colossal
medley
a
gigantic
coloured
blur
that
merely
bewildered
only
lesser
points
lodged
comfortably
in
the
heart
i
saw
a
chaotic
vision
sands
drenched
in
dazzling
light
vast
granite
aisles
stupendous
figures
that
stared
unblinking
at
the
sun
a
shining
river
and
a
shadowy
desert
both
endless
as
the
sky
mountainous
pyramids
and
gigantic
monoliths
armies
of
heads
of
paws
of
faces
all
set
to
a
scale
of
size
that
was
prodigious
the
items
stunned
the
composite
effect
was
too
unwieldy
to
be
grasped
something
that
blazed
with
splendour
rolled
before
the
eyes
too
close
to
be
seen
distinctly
at
the
same
time
very
distant
unrealised
then
with
the
passing
of
the
weeks
it
slowly
stirred
to
life
it
had
attacked
unseen
its
grip
was
quite
tremendous
yet
it
could
be
neither
told
nor
painted
nor
described
it
flamed
up
unexpectedly
in
the
foggy
london
streets
at
the
club
in
the
theatre
a
sound
recalled
the
of
the
arabs
a
breath
of
scented
air
brought
back
the
heated
sand
beyond
the
palm
groves
up
rose
the
huge
egyptian
glamour
transforming
common
things
it
had
lain
buried
all
this
time
in
deep
recesses
of
the
heart
that
are
inaccessible
to
ordinary
daily
life
and
there
hid
in
it
something
of
uneasiness
that
was
inexplicable
awe
a
hint
of
cold
eternity
a
touch
of
something
unchanging
and
terrific
something
sublime
made
lovely
yet
unearthly
with
shadowy
time
and
distance
the
melancholy
of
the
nile
and
the
grandeur
of
a
hundred
battered
temples
dropped
some
unutterable
beauty
upon
the
heart
up
swept
the
desert
air
the
luminous
pale
shadows
the
naked
desolation
that
yet
brims
with
sharp
vitality
an
arab
on
his
donkey
tripped
in
colour
across
the
mind
melting
off
into
tiny
perspective
strangely
vivid
a
string
of
camels
stood
in
silhouette
against
the
crimson
sky
great
winds
great
blazing
spaces
great
solemn
nights
great
days
of
golden
splendour
rose
from
the
pavement
or
the
and
london
england
the
whole
of
modern
life
indeed
seemed
suddenly
reduced
to
a
paltry
insignificance
that
produced
an
aching
longing
for
the
pageantry
of
those
millions
of
vanished
souls
egypt
rolled
through
the
heart
for
a
moment
and
was
gone
i
remembered
that
some
such
fantastic
experience
had
been
mine
put
it
as
one
may
the
fact
remains
that
for
certain
temperaments
egypt
can
rob
the
present
of
some
thread
of
interest
that
was
formerly
there
the
memory
became
for
me
an
integral
part
of
personality
something
in
me
yearned
for
its
curious
and
awful
beauty
he
who
has
drunk
of
the
nile
shall
return
to
drink
of
it
again
and
if
for
myself
this
was
possible
what
might
not
happen
to
a
character
of
george
isley
s
type
some
glimmer
of
comprehension
came
to
me
the
ancient
buried
hidden
egypt
had
cast
her
net
about
his
soul
grown
shadowy
in
the
present
his
life
was
being
transferred
into
some
golden
reconstructed
past
where
it
was
real
some
countries
give
while
others
take
away
and
george
isley
was
worth
robbing
disturbed
by
these
singular
reflections
i
moved
away
from
the
open
window
closing
it
but
the
closing
did
not
exclude
the
presence
of
the
third
the
biting
night
air
followed
me
in
i
drew
the
mosquito
curtains
round
the
bed
but
the
light
i
left
still
burning
and
lying
there
i
jotted
down
upon
a
scrap
of
paper
this
curious
impression
as
best
i
could
only
to
find
that
it
escaped
easily
between
the
words
such
visionary
and
spiritual
perceptions
are
too
elusive
to
be
trapped
in
language
reading
it
over
after
an
interval
of
years
it
is
difficult
to
recall
with
what
intense
meaning
what
uncanny
emotion
i
wrote
those
faded
lines
in
pencil
their
rhetoric
seems
cheap
their
content
much
exaggerated
yet
at
the
time
truth
burned
in
every
syllable
egypt
which
since
time
began
has
suffered
robbery
with
violence
at
the
hands
of
all
the
world
now
takes
her
vengeance
choosing
her
individual
prey
her
time
has
come
behind
a
modern
mask
she
lies
in
wait
intensely
active
sure
of
her
hidden
power
prostitute
of
dead
empires
she
lies
now
at
peace
beneath
the
same
old
stars
her
loveliness
unimpaired
bejewelled
with
the
beaten
gold
of
ages
her
breasts
uncovered
and
her
grand
limbs
flashing
in
the
sun
her
shoulders
of
alabaster
are
lifted
above
the
she
surveys
the
little
figures
of
she
takes
her
choice
that
night
i
did
not
dream
but
neither
did
the
whole
of
me
lie
down
in
sleep
during
the
long
dark
hours
i
was
aware
of
that
picture
endlessly
repeating
itself
the
picture
of
george
isley
stealing
out
into
the
moonlight
desert
the
night
so
swiftly
dropped
her
hood
about
him
so
mysteriously
he
merged
into
the
unchanging
thing
which
cloaks
the
past
it
lifted
some
huge
shadowy
hand
gloved
softly
yet
of
granite
stretched
over
the
leagues
to
take
him
he
disappeared
they
say
the
desert
is
motionless
and
has
no
gestures
that
night
i
saw
it
moving
hurrying
it
went
tearing
after
him
you
understand
my
meaning
no
well
when
excited
it
produces
this
strange
impression
and
the
terrible
moment
is
when
you
surrender
helplessly
you
desire
it
shall
swallow
you
you
let
it
come
george
isley
spoke
of
a
web
it
is
at
any
rate
some
central
power
that
conceals
itself
behind
the
surface
glamour
folk
call
the
spell
of
egypt
its
home
is
not
apparent
it
dwells
with
ancient
egypt
underground
behind
the
stillness
of
hot
windless
days
behind
the
peace
of
calm
gigantic
nights
it
lurks
unrealised
monstrous
and
irresistible
my
mind
grasped
it
as
little
as
the
fact
that
our
solar
system
with
all
its
retinue
of
satellites
and
planets
rushes
annually
many
million
miles
towards
a
star
in
hercules
while
yet
that
constellation
appears
no
closer
than
it
did
six
thousand
years
ago
but
the
clue
dropped
into
me
george
isley
with
his
entire
retinue
of
thought
and
life
and
feeling
was
being
similarly
drawn
and
i
a
minor
satellite
had
become
aware
of
the
horrifying
pull
it
was
magnificent
and
i
fell
asleep
on
the
crest
of
this
enormous
wave
v
the
next
few
days
passed
idly
weeks
passed
too
i
think
hidden
away
in
this
cosmopolitan
hotel
we
lived
apart
unnoticed
there
was
the
feeling
that
time
went
what
pace
it
pleased
now
fast
now
slow
now
standing
still
the
similarity
of
the
brilliant
days
set
between
wondrous
dawns
and
sunsets
left
the
impression
that
it
was
really
one
long
endless
day
without
divisions
the
mind
s
machinery
of
measurement
suffered
dislocation
time
went
backwards
dates
were
forgotten
the
month
the
time
of
year
the
century
itself
went
down
into
undifferentiated
life
the
present
certainly
slipped
away
curiously
newspapers
and
politics
became
unimportant
news
uninteresting
english
life
so
remote
as
to
be
unreal
european
affairs
shadowy
the
stream
of
life
ran
in
another
direction
altogether
backwards
the
names
and
faces
of
friends
appeared
through
mist
people
arrived
as
though
dropped
from
the
skies
they
suddenly
were
there
one
saw
them
in
the
as
though
they
had
just
slipped
in
from
an
outer
world
that
once
was
real
somewhere
of
course
a
steamer
sailed
four
times
a
week
and
the
journey
took
five
days
but
these
things
were
merely
known
not
realised
the
fact
that
here
it
was
summer
whereas
over
there
winter
reigned
helped
to
make
the
distance
not
quite
thinkable
we
looked
at
the
desert
and
made
plans
we
will
do
this
we
will
do
that
we
must
go
there
we
ll
visit
such
and
such
a
place
yet
nothing
happened
it
always
was
or
yesterday
and
we
shared
the
discovery
of
alice
that
there
was
no
real
for
our
thinking
made
everything
happen
that
was
enough
it
happened
it
was
the
reality
of
dreams
egypt
was
a
that
made
the
heart
live
backwards
it
came
about
thus
that
for
the
next
few
weeks
i
watched
a
fading
life
myself
alert
and
sympathetic
yet
unable
somehow
to
intrude
and
help
noticing
various
little
things
by
which
george
isley
betrayed
the
progress
of
the
unequal
struggle
i
found
my
assistance
negatived
by
the
fact
that
i
was
in
similar
case
myself
what
he
experienced
in
large
and
finally
i
too
experienced
in
little
and
for
the
moment
for
i
seemed
also
caught
upon
the
fringe
of
the
invisible
web
my
feelings
were
entangled
sufficiently
for
me
to
understand
and
the
decline
of
his
being
was
terrible
to
watch
his
character
went
with
it
i
saw
his
talents
fade
his
personality
dwindle
his
very
soul
dissolve
before
the
insidious
and
invading
influence
he
hardly
struggled
i
thought
of
those
abominable
insects
that
paralyse
the
motor
systems
of
their
victims
and
then
devour
them
at
their
leisure
alive
the
incredible
adventure
was
literally
true
but
being
spiritual
may
not
be
told
in
the
terms
of
a
detective
story
this
version
must
remain
an
individual
rendering
an
aspect
of
possible
version
all
who
know
the
real
egypt
that
egypt
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
dams
and
nationalists
and
the
external
welfare
of
the
falaheen
will
understand
the
pilfering
of
her
ancient
dead
she
suffers
still
she
in
revenge
preys
at
her
leisure
on
the
living
the
occasions
when
he
betrayed
himself
were
ordinary
enough
it
was
the
glimpse
they
afforded
of
what
was
in
progress
beneath
his
calm
exterior
that
made
them
interesting
once
i
remember
we
had
lunched
together
at
mena
and
after
visiting
certain
excavations
beyond
the
gizeh
pyramids
we
made
our
way
homewards
by
way
of
the
sphinx
it
was
dusk
and
the
main
army
of
tourists
had
retired
though
some
few
dozen
still
moved
about
to
the
cries
of
and
baksheesh
the
vast
head
and
shoulders
suddenly
emerged
riding
undrowned
above
the
sea
of
sand
dark
and
monstrous
in
the
fading
light
it
loomed
as
ever
a
being
of
lineage
no
amount
of
familiarity
could
depreciate
its
grandeur
its
impressive
setting
the
lost
expression
of
the
countenance
that
is
too
huge
to
focus
as
a
face
a
thousand
visits
leave
its
power
undiminished
it
has
intruded
upon
our
earth
from
some
uncommon
world
george
isley
and
myself
both
turned
aside
to
acknowledge
the
presence
of
this
alien
uncomfortable
thing
we
did
not
linger
but
we
slackened
pace
it
was
the
obvious
inevitable
thing
to
do
he
pointed
then
with
a
suddenness
that
made
me
start
he
indicated
the
tourists
standing
round
see
he
said
in
a
lowered
tone
day
and
night
you
ll
always
find
a
crowd
obedient
to
that
thing
but
notice
their
behaviour
people
don
t
do
that
before
any
other
ruin
in
the
world
i
ve
ever
he
referred
to
the
attempts
of
individuals
to
creep
away
alone
and
stare
into
the
stupendous
visage
by
themselves
at
different
points
in
the
deep
sandy
basin
were
men
and
women
standing
solitary
lying
crouching
apart
from
the
main
company
where
the
dragomen
mouthed
their
exposition
with
impertinent
glibness
the
desire
to
be
alone
he
went
on
half
to
himself
as
we
paused
a
moment
the
sense
of
worship
which
insists
on
it
significant
for
no
amount
of
advertising
could
dwarf
the
impressiveness
of
the
inscrutable
visage
into
whose
eyes
of
stone
the
silent
humans
gazed
not
even
the
standing
inside
one
gigantic
ear
could
introduce
the
commonplace
but
my
companion
s
words
let
another
thing
into
the
spectacle
a
less
exalted
thing
dropping
a
hint
of
horror
about
that
sandy
cup
it
became
easy
for
a
moment
to
imagine
these
tourists
worshipping
against
their
will
to
picture
the
monster
noticing
that
they
were
there
that
it
might
slowly
turn
its
awful
head
that
the
sand
might
visibly
trickle
from
a
stirring
paw
that
in
a
word
they
might
be
taken
changed
come
he
whispered
in
a
dropping
tone
interrupting
my
fancies
as
though
he
half
divined
them
it
is
getting
late
and
to
be
alone
with
the
thing
is
intolerable
to
me
just
now
but
you
notice
don
t
you
he
added
as
he
took
my
arm
to
hurry
me
away
how
little
the
tourists
matter
instead
of
injuring
the
effect
they
increase
it
it
uses
and
again
a
slight
sensation
of
chill
communicated
possibly
by
his
nervous
touch
or
possibly
by
his
earnest
way
of
saying
these
curious
words
passed
through
me
some
part
of
me
remained
behind
in
that
hollow
trough
of
sand
prostrate
before
an
immensity
that
symbolised
the
past
a
curious
wild
yearning
caught
me
momentarily
an
intense
desire
to
understand
exactly
why
that
terror
stood
there
its
actual
meaning
long
ago
to
the
hearts
that
set
it
waiting
for
the
sun
what
definite
rôle
it
played
what
souls
it
stirred
and
why
in
that
system
of
towering
belief
and
faith
whose
indestructible
emblem
it
still
remained
the
past
stood
grouped
so
solemnly
about
its
menacing
presentment
i
was
distinctly
aware
of
this
spiritual
suction
backwards
that
my
companion
yielded
to
so
gladly
yet
against
his
normal
modern
self
for
it
made
the
past
appear
magnificently
desirable
and
loosened
all
the
rivets
of
the
present
it
bodied
forth
three
main
ingredients
of
this
deep
egyptian
spell
size
mystery
and
immobility
yet
to
my
relief
the
cheaper
aspect
of
this
egyptian
glamour
left
him
cold
he
remained
unmoved
by
the
commonplace
mysterious
he
told
no
mummy
stories
nor
ever
hinted
at
the
supernatural
quality
that
leaps
to
the
mind
of
the
majority
there
was
no
play
in
him
the
influence
was
grave
and
vital
and
although
i
knew
he
held
strong
views
with
regard
to
the
impiety
of
disturbing
the
dead
he
never
in
my
hearing
attached
any
possible
revengeful
character
to
the
energy
of
an
outraged
past
the
current
tales
of
this
description
he
ignored
they
were
for
superstitious
minds
or
children
the
deities
that
claimed
his
soul
were
of
a
grander
order
altogether
he
lived
if
it
may
be
so
expressed
already
in
a
world
his
heart
had
reconstructed
or
remembered
it
drew
him
in
another
direction
altogether
with
the
modern
sensational
view
of
life
his
spirit
held
no
traffic
any
longer
he
was
living
backwards
i
saw
his
figure
receding
mournfully
yet
never
sentimentally
into
the
spacious
golden
atmosphere
of
recaptured
days
the
enormous
soul
of
buried
egypt
drew
him
down
the
dwindling
of
his
physical
appearance
was
of
course
a
mental
interpretation
of
my
own
but
another
stranger
interpretation
of
a
spiritual
kind
moved
parallel
with
it
marvellous
and
horrible
for
as
he
diminished
outwardly
and
in
his
modern
present
aspect
he
grew
within
gigantic
the
size
of
egypt
entered
into
him
huge
proportions
now
began
to
accompany
any
presentment
of
his
personality
to
my
inner
vision
he
towered
these
two
qualities
of
the
land
already
obsessed
him
magnitude
and
immobility
and
that
awe
which
modern
life
ignores
contemptuously
woke
in
my
heart
i
almost
feared
his
presence
at
certain
times
for
one
aspect
of
the
egyptian
spell
is
explained
by
sheer
size
and
bulk
disdainful
of
mere
speed
the
heart
is
still
uncomfortable
with
magnitude
and
in
egypt
there
is
size
that
may
easily
appal
for
every
detail
shunts
it
laboriously
upon
the
mind
it
elbows
out
the
present
the
desert
s
vastness
is
not
made
comprehensible
by
mileage
and
the
sources
of
the
nile
are
so
distant
that
they
exist
less
on
the
map
than
in
the
imagination
the
effort
to
realise
suffers
paralysis
they
might
equally
be
in
the
moon
or
saturn
the
undecorated
magnificence
of
the
desert
remains
unknown
just
as
the
proportions
of
pyramid
and
temple
of
pylons
and
colossi
approach
the
edge
of
the
mind
yet
never
enter
in
all
stand
outside
clothed
in
this
prodigious
measurement
of
the
past
and
the
old
beliefs
not
only
share
this
titanic
effect
upon
the
consciousness
but
carry
it
stages
further
the
entire
scale
haunts
with
uncomfortable
immensity
so
that
the
majority
run
back
with
relief
to
the
measurable
details
of
a
more
manageable
scale
express
trains
flying
machines
atlantic
liners
these
produce
no
unpleasant
stretching
of
the
faculties
compared
to
the
influence
of
the
karnak
pylons
the
pyramids
or
the
interior
of
the
serapeum
close
behind
this
magnitude
moreover
steps
the
monstrous
it
is
revealed
not
in
sand
and
stone
alone
in
queer
effects
of
light
and
shadow
of
glittering
sunsets
and
of
magical
dusks
but
in
the
very
aspect
of
the
bird
and
animal
life
the
buffaloes
betray
it
equally
with
the
vultures
the
myriad
kites
the
grotesqueness
of
the
mouthing
camels
the
rude
enormous
scenery
has
it
everywhere
there
is
nothing
lyrical
in
this
land
of
passionate
mirages
uncouth
immensity
notes
the
little
human
flittings
the
days
roll
by
in
a
tide
of
golden
splendour
one
goes
helplessly
with
the
flood
but
it
is
an
irresistible
flood
that
sweeps
backwards
and
below
the
natives
in
their
coloured
robes
move
before
a
curtain
and
behind
that
curtain
dwells
the
soul
of
ancient
egypt
the
reality
as
george
isley
called
it
watching
with
sleepless
eyes
of
grey
infinity
then
sometimes
the
curtain
stirs
and
lifts
an
edge
an
invisible
hand
creeps
forth
the
soul
is
touched
and
some
one
disappears
vi
the
process
of
disintegration
must
have
been
at
work
a
long
time
before
i
appeared
upon
the
scene
the
changes
went
forward
with
such
rapidity
it
was
his
third
year
in
egypt
two
of
which
had
been
spent
without
interruption
in
company
with
an
egyptologist
named
moleson
in
the
neighbourhood
of
thebes
i
soon
discovered
that
this
region
was
for
him
the
centre
of
attraction
or
as
he
put
it
of
the
web
not
luxor
of
course
nor
the
images
of
reconstructed
karnak
but
that
stretch
of
grim
forbidding
mountains
where
royalty
earthly
and
spiritual
sought
eternal
peace
for
the
physical
remains
there
amid
surroundings
of
superb
desolation
great
priests
and
mighty
kings
had
thought
themselves
secure
from
sacrilegious
touch
in
caverns
underground
they
kept
their
faithful
tryst
with
centuries
guarded
by
the
silence
of
magnificent
gloom
there
they
waited
communing
with
passing
ages
in
their
sleep
till
ra
their
glad
divinity
should
summon
them
to
the
fulfilment
of
their
ancient
dream
and
there
in
the
valley
of
the
tombs
of
the
kings
their
dream
was
shattered
their
lovely
prophecies
derided
and
their
glory
dimmed
by
the
impious
desecration
of
the
curious
that
george
isley
and
his
companion
had
spent
their
time
not
merely
digging
and
deciphering
like
their
practical
confrères
but
engaged
in
some
strange
experiments
of
recovery
and
reconstruction
was
matter
for
open
comment
among
the
fraternity
that
incredible
things
had
happened
there
was
the
big
story
of
two
egyptian
seasons
at
least
i
heard
this
later
only
tales
of
utterly
incredible
kind
that
the
desolate
vale
of
rock
was
seen
repeopled
on
moonlit
nights
that
the
smoke
of
unaccustomed
fires
rose
to
cap
the
peaks
that
the
pageantry
of
some
forgotten
worship
had
been
seen
to
issue
from
the
openings
of
these
hills
and
that
sounds
of
chanting
sonorous
and
marvellously
sweet
had
been
heard
to
echo
from
those
bleak
repellent
precipices
the
tales
apparently
were
grossly
exaggerated
wandering
bedouins
brought
them
in
the
guides
and
dragomen
repeated
them
with
mysterious
additions
till
they
filtered
down
through
the
native
servants
in
the
hotels
and
reached
the
tourists
with
highly
picturesque
embroidery
they
reached
the
authorities
too
the
only
accurate
fact
i
gathered
at
the
time
however
was
that
they
had
abruptly
ceased
george
isley
and
moleson
moreover
had
parted
company
and
moleson
i
heard
was
the
originator
of
the
business
he
was
at
this
time
unknown
to
me
his
arresting
book
on
a
modern
reconstruction
of
in
ancient
egypt
being
my
only
link
with
his
unusual
mind
apparently
he
regarded
the
sun
as
the
deity
of
the
scientific
religion
of
the
future
which
would
replace
the
various
anthropomorphic
gods
of
childish
creeds
he
discussed
the
possibility
of
the
zodiacal
signs
being
some
kind
of
celestial
intelligences
belief
blazed
on
every
page
men
s
life
is
heat
derived
solely
from
the
sun
and
men
were
therefore
part
of
the
sun
in
the
sense
that
a
christian
is
part
of
his
personal
deity
and
absorption
was
the
end
his
description
of
ceremonials
conveyed
an
amazing
reality
and
beauty
this
singular
book
however
was
all
i
knew
of
him
until
he
came
to
visit
us
in
helouan
though
i
easily
discerned
that
his
influence
somehow
was
the
original
cause
of
the
change
in
my
companion
at
thebes
then
was
the
active
centre
of
the
influence
that
drew
my
friend
away
from
modern
things
it
was
there
i
easily
guessed
that
obstacles
had
been
placed
in
the
way
of
these
men
s
too
close
enquiry
in
that
haunted
and
oppressive
valley
where
profane
and
reverent
come
to
actual
grips
where
modern
curiosity
is
most
busily
organised
and
even
tourists
are
aware
of
a
masked
hostility
that
dogs
the
prying
of
the
least
imaginative
mind
there
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
had
egypt
set
the
headquarters
of
her
irreconcilable
enmity
and
it
was
there
amid
the
ruins
of
her
loveliest
past
that
george
isley
had
spent
his
years
of
magical
reconstruction
and
met
the
influence
that
now
dominated
his
entire
life
and
though
no
definite
avowal
of
the
struggle
betrayed
itself
in
speech
between
us
i
remember
fragments
of
conversation
even
at
this
stage
that
proved
his
willing
surrender
of
the
present
we
spoke
of
fear
once
though
with
the
indirectness
of
connection
i
have
mentioned
i
urged
that
the
mind
once
it
is
forewarned
can
remain
master
of
itself
and
prevent
a
thing
from
happening
but
that
does
not
make
the
thing
unreal
he
objected
the
mind
can
deny
it
i
said
it
then
becomes
he
shook
his
head
one
does
not
deny
an
unreality
denial
is
a
childish
act
of
against
something
you
expect
to
he
caught
my
eye
a
moment
you
deny
what
you
are
afraid
of
he
said
fear
and
he
smiled
uneasily
you
know
it
must
get
you
in
the
and
both
of
us
being
aware
secretly
to
what
our
talk
referred
it
seemed
and
improper
for
actually
we
discussed
the
psychology
of
his
disappearance
yet
while
i
disliked
it
there
was
a
fascination
about
the
subject
that
compelled
attraction
once
fear
gets
in
he
added
presently
confidence
is
undermined
the
structure
of
life
is
threatened
and
you
go
gladly
the
foundation
of
everything
is
belief
a
man
is
what
he
believes
about
himself
and
in
egypt
you
can
believe
things
that
elsewhere
you
would
not
even
think
about
it
attacks
the
he
sighed
yet
with
a
curious
pleasure
and
a
smile
of
resignation
and
relief
passed
over
his
rugged
features
and
was
gone
again
the
luxury
of
abandonment
lay
already
in
him
but
even
belief
i
protested
must
be
founded
on
some
experience
or
it
seemed
ghastly
to
speak
of
his
spiritual
malady
behind
the
mask
of
indirect
allusion
my
excuse
was
that
he
so
obviously
talked
willingly
he
agreed
instantly
experience
of
one
kind
or
another
he
said
darkly
there
always
is
talk
with
the
men
who
live
out
here
ask
any
one
who
thinks
or
who
has
the
imagination
which
divines
you
ll
get
only
one
reply
phrase
it
how
they
may
even
the
tourists
and
the
little
commonplace
officials
feel
it
and
it
s
not
the
climate
it
s
not
nerves
it
s
not
any
definite
tendency
that
they
can
name
or
lay
their
finger
on
nor
is
it
mere
orientalising
of
the
mind
it
s
something
that
first
takes
you
from
your
common
life
and
that
later
takes
common
life
from
you
you
willingly
resign
an
unremunerative
present
there
are
no
either
once
the
gates
are
there
was
so
much
undeniable
truth
in
this
that
i
found
no
corrective
by
way
of
strong
rejoinder
all
my
attempts
indeed
were
futile
in
this
way
he
meant
to
go
my
words
could
not
stop
him
he
wanted
a
witness
he
dreaded
the
loneliness
of
going
but
he
brooked
no
interference
the
contradictory
position
involved
a
perplexing
state
of
heart
and
mind
in
both
of
us
the
atmosphere
of
this
majestic
land
so
trifling
yesterday
so
immense
most
certainly
induced
a
lifting
of
the
spiritual
horizon
that
revealed
amazing
possibilities
vii
it
was
in
the
windless
days
of
a
perfect
december
that
moleson
the
egyptologist
found
us
out
and
paid
a
flying
visit
to
helouan
his
duties
took
him
up
and
down
the
land
but
his
time
seemed
largely
at
his
own
disposal
he
lingered
on
his
coming
introduced
a
new
element
i
was
not
quite
able
to
estimate
though
speaking
generally
the
effect
of
his
presence
upon
my
companion
was
to
emphasise
the
latter
s
alteration
it
underlined
the
change
and
drew
attention
to
it
the
new
arrival
i
gathered
was
not
altogether
welcome
i
should
never
have
expected
to
find
you
laughed
moleson
when
they
met
and
whether
he
referred
to
helouan
or
to
the
hotel
was
not
quite
clear
i
got
the
impression
he
meant
both
i
remembered
my
fancy
that
it
was
a
good
hotel
to
hide
in
george
isley
had
betrayed
a
slight
involuntary
start
when
the
visiting
card
was
brought
to
him
at
i
think
he
had
wished
to
escape
from
his
former
moleson
had
found
him
out
i
heard
you
had
a
friend
with
you
and
were
contemplating
further
exper
work
he
added
he
changed
the
word
experiment
quickly
to
the
other
the
former
as
you
see
is
true
but
not
the
latter
replied
my
companion
dryly
and
in
his
manner
was
a
touch
of
opposition
that
might
have
been
hostility
their
intimacy
i
saw
was
close
and
of
old
standing
in
all
they
said
and
did
and
looked
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
other
meaning
that
just
escaped
me
they
were
up
to
something
they
been
up
to
something
but
isley
would
have
withdrawn
if
he
could
moleson
was
an
ambitious
and
energetic
personality
absorbed
in
his
profession
alive
to
the
poetical
as
well
as
to
the
practical
value
of
archaeology
and
he
made
at
first
a
wholly
delightful
impression
upon
me
an
instinctive
for
his
subject
had
early
in
life
brought
him
success
and
a
measure
of
fame
as
well
his
knowledge
was
accurate
and
scholarly
his
mind
saturated
in
the
lore
of
a
vanished
civilisation
behind
an
exterior
that
was
quietly
careless
i
divined
a
passionate
and
complex
nature
and
i
watched
him
with
interest
as
the
man
for
whom
the
olden
of
unscientific
days
held
some
beauty
of
reality
and
truth
much
in
his
strange
book
that
had
bewildered
me
now
seemed
intelligible
when
i
saw
the
author
i
can
not
explain
this
more
closely
something
about
him
somehow
made
it
possible
though
modern
to
the
and
thoroughly
equipped
with
all
the
tendencies
of
the
day
there
seemed
to
hide
in
him
another
self
that
held
aloof
with
a
dignified
detachment
from
the
interests
in
which
his
educated
mind
was
centred
he
read
living
secrets
beneath
museum
labels
i
might
put
it
he
stepped
out
of
the
days
of
the
pharaohs
if
ever
man
did
and
i
realised
early
in
our
acquaintance
that
this
was
the
man
who
had
exceptional
powers
of
resistance
and
and
was
in
his
particular
branch
of
work
in
manner
he
was
light
and
gay
his
sense
of
humour
strong
with
a
way
of
treating
everything
as
though
laughter
was
the
sanest
attitude
towards
life
there
is
however
the
laughter
that
hides
other
things
moleson
as
i
gathered
from
many
clues
of
talk
and
manner
and
silence
was
a
deep
and
singular
being
his
experiences
in
egypt
if
any
he
had
survived
admirably
there
were
at
least
two
molesons
i
felt
him
more
than
double
multiple
in
appearance
tall
thin
and
fleshless
with
a
skin
and
features
withered
as
a
mummy
s
he
said
laughingly
that
nature
had
picked
him
physically
for
his
job
and
indeed
one
could
see
him
worming
his
way
down
narrow
tunnels
into
the
sandy
tombs
and
writhing
along
sunless
passages
of
suffocating
heat
without
too
much
personal
inconvenience
something
sinuous
almost
fluid
in
his
mind
expressed
itself
in
his
body
too
he
might
go
in
any
direction
without
causing
surprise
he
might
go
backwards
or
forwards
he
might
go
in
two
directions
at
once
and
my
first
impression
of
the
man
deepened
before
many
days
were
past
there
was
irresponsibility
in
him
insincerity
somewhere
almost
want
of
heart
his
morality
was
certainly
not
s
and
the
mind
in
him
was
slippery
i
think
the
modern
world
to
which
he
was
unattached
confused
and
irritated
him
a
sense
of
insecurity
came
with
him
his
interest
in
george
isley
was
the
interest
in
a
psychological
i
remembered
how
in
his
book
he
described
the
selection
of
individuals
for
certain
functions
of
that
marvellous
worship
and
the
odd
idea
flashed
through
me
well
that
isley
exactly
suited
some
purpose
of
his
energies
the
man
was
keenly
observant
from
top
to
toe
but
not
with
his
sight
alone
he
seemed
to
be
aware
of
motives
and
emotions
before
he
noticed
the
acts
or
gestures
that
these
caused
i
felt
that
he
took
me
in
as
well
certainly
he
eyed
me
up
and
down
by
means
of
this
inner
observation
that
seemed
automatic
with
him
moleson
was
not
staying
in
our
hotel
he
had
chosen
one
where
social
life
was
more
abundant
but
he
came
up
frequently
to
lunch
and
dine
and
sometimes
spent
the
evening
in
isley
s
rooms
amusing
us
with
his
skill
upon
the
piano
singing
arab
songs
and
chanting
phrases
from
the
ancient
egyptian
rituals
to
rhythms
of
his
own
invention
the
old
egyptian
music
both
in
harmony
and
melody
was
far
more
developed
than
i
had
realised
the
use
of
sound
having
been
of
radical
importance
in
their
ceremonies
the
chanting
in
particular
he
did
with
extraordinary
effect
though
whether
its
success
lay
in
his
sonorous
voice
his
peculiar
increasing
of
the
vowel
sounds
or
in
anything
deeper
i
can
not
pretend
to
say
the
result
at
any
rate
was
of
a
unique
description
it
brought
buried
egypt
to
the
surface
the
gigantic
presence
entered
sensibly
into
the
room
it
came
huge
and
gorgeous
rolling
upon
the
mind
the
instant
he
began
and
something
in
it
was
both
terrible
and
oppressive
the
repose
of
eternity
lay
in
the
sound
invariably
after
a
few
moments
of
that
transforming
music
i
saw
the
valley
of
the
kings
the
deserted
temples
titanic
faces
of
stone
great
effigies
coifed
with
zodiacal
signs
but
above
all
the
twin
colossi
i
mentioned
this
latter
detail
curious
should
feel
that
too
curious
you
should
say
it
i
mean
moleson
replied
not
looking
at
me
yet
with
an
air
as
if
i
had
said
something
he
expected
to
me
the
memnon
figures
express
egypt
better
than
all
the
other
monuments
put
together
like
the
desert
they
are
featureless
they
sum
her
up
as
it
were
yet
leave
the
message
unuttered
for
you
see
they
can
not
he
laughed
a
little
in
his
throat
they
have
neither
eyes
nor
lips
nor
nose
their
features
are
yet
they
tell
the
secret
to
those
who
care
to
listen
put
in
isley
in
a
scarcely
noticeable
voice
just
because
they
have
no
words
they
still
sing
at
dawn
he
added
in
a
louder
almost
a
challenging
tone
it
startled
me
moleson
turned
round
at
him
opened
his
lips
to
speak
hesitated
stopped
he
said
nothing
for
a
moment
i
can
not
describe
what
it
was
in
the
lightning
glance
they
exchanged
that
put
me
on
the
alert
for
something
other
than
was
obvious
my
nerves
quivered
suddenly
and
a
breath
of
colder
air
stole
in
among
us
moleson
swung
round
to
me
again
i
almost
think
he
said
laughing
when
i
complimented
him
upon
the
music
that
i
must
have
been
a
priest
of
in
an
earlier
existence
for
all
this
comes
to
my
as
if
it
were
instinctive
knowledge
plotinus
remember
lived
a
few
miles
away
at
alexandria
with
his
great
idea
that
knowledge
is
recollection
he
said
with
a
kind
of
cynical
amusement
in
those
days
at
any
rate
he
added
more
significantly
worship
was
real
and
ceremonials
actually
expressed
great
ideas
and
teaching
there
was
power
in
two
of
the
molesons
spoke
in
that
contradictory
utterance
i
saw
that
isley
was
fidgeting
where
he
sat
betraying
by
certain
gestures
that
uneasiness
was
in
him
he
hid
his
face
a
moment
in
his
hands
he
sighed
he
made
a
movement
as
though
to
prevent
something
coming
but
moleson
resisted
his
attempt
to
change
the
conversation
though
the
key
shifted
a
little
of
its
own
accord
there
were
numerous
occasions
like
this
when
i
was
aware
that
both
men
skirted
something
that
had
happened
something
that
moleson
wished
to
resume
but
that
isley
seemed
anxious
to
postpone
i
found
myself
studying
moleson
s
personality
yet
never
getting
beyond
a
certain
point
shrewd
subtle
with
an
acute
rather
than
a
large
intelligence
he
was
cynical
as
well
as
insincere
and
yet
i
can
not
describe
by
what
means
i
arrived
at
two
other
conclusions
as
well
about
him
first
that
this
insincerity
and
want
of
heart
had
not
been
so
always
and
secondly
that
he
sought
social
diversion
with
deliberate
and
purpose
i
could
well
believe
that
the
first
was
egypt
s
mark
upon
him
and
the
second
an
effort
at
resistance
and
if
it
wasn
t
for
the
gaiety
he
remarked
once
in
a
flippant
way
that
thinly
hid
significance
a
man
out
here
would
go
under
in
a
year
social
life
gets
rather
reckless
exaggerated
people
do
things
they
would
never
dream
of
doing
at
home
perhaps
you
ve
noticed
it
he
added
looking
suddenly
at
me
cairo
and
the
rest
they
plunge
at
it
as
though
driven
a
sort
of
excess
about
it
i
nodded
agreement
the
way
he
said
it
was
unpleasant
rather
it
s
an
antidote
he
said
a
flavour
in
his
tone
i
used
to
loathe
society
myself
but
now
i
find
gaiety
a
certain
irresponsible
excitement
of
importance
egypt
gets
on
the
nerves
after
a
bit
the
moral
fibre
fails
the
will
grows
and
he
glanced
covertly
at
isley
as
with
a
desire
to
point
his
meaning
it
s
the
clash
between
the
ugly
present
and
the
majestic
past
he
smiled
isley
shrugged
his
shoulders
making
no
reply
and
the
other
went
on
to
tell
stories
of
friends
and
acquaintances
whom
egypt
had
adversely
affected
barton
the
oxford
man
school
teacher
who
had
insisted
in
living
in
a
tent
until
the
government
relieved
him
of
his
job
he
took
to
his
tent
roamed
the
desert
drawn
irresistibly
practical
considerations
of
the
present
of
no
avail
this
yearning
took
him
though
he
could
never
define
the
exact
attraction
in
the
end
his
mental
balance
was
disturbed
but
now
he
s
all
right
again
i
saw
him
in
london
only
this
year
he
can
t
say
what
he
felt
or
why
he
did
it
only
he
s
of
john
lattin
too
he
spoke
whom
agarophobia
caught
so
terribly
in
upper
egypt
of
malahide
upon
whom
some
fascination
of
the
nile
induced
suicidal
mania
and
attempts
at
drowning
of
jim
moleson
a
cousin
who
had
camped
at
thebes
with
himself
and
isley
whom
megalomania
of
a
most
singular
type
attacked
suddenly
in
a
sandy
waste
all
radically
cured
as
soon
as
they
left
egypt
yet
one
and
all
changed
and
made
otherwise
in
their
very
souls
he
talked
in
a
loose
disjointed
way
and
though
much
he
said
was
fantastic
as
if
meant
to
challenge
opposition
there
was
impressiveness
about
it
somewhere
due
i
think
to
a
kind
of
cumulative
emotion
he
produced
the
monuments
do
not
impress
merely
by
their
bulk
but
by
their
majestic
symmetry
i
remember
him
saying
look
at
the
choice
of
form
alone
the
pyramids
for
instance
no
other
shape
was
possible
dome
square
spires
all
would
have
been
hideously
inadequate
the
mass
immense
foundations
and
pointed
apex
were
the
in
outline
do
you
think
people
without
greatness
in
themselves
chose
that
form
there
was
no
unbalance
in
the
minds
that
conceived
the
harmonious
and
magnificent
structures
of
the
temples
there
was
stately
grandeur
in
their
consciousness
that
could
only
be
born
of
truth
and
knowledge
the
power
in
their
images
is
a
direct
expression
of
eternal
and
essential
things
they
we
listened
in
silence
he
was
off
upon
his
hobby
but
behind
the
careless
tone
and
laughing
questions
there
was
this
lurking
passionateness
that
made
me
feel
uncomfortable
he
was
edging
up
i
felt
towards
some
climax
that
meant
life
and
death
to
himself
and
isley
i
could
not
fathom
it
my
sympathy
let
me
in
a
little
yet
not
enough
to
understand
completely
isley
i
saw
was
also
uneasy
though
for
reasons
that
equally
evaded
me
one
can
almost
believe
he
continued
that
something
still
hangs
about
in
the
atmosphere
from
those
olden
he
half
closed
his
eyes
but
i
caught
the
gleam
in
them
it
affects
the
mind
through
the
imagination
with
some
it
changes
the
point
of
view
it
takes
the
soul
back
with
it
to
former
quite
different
conditions
that
must
have
been
almost
another
kind
of
he
paused
an
instant
and
looked
up
at
us
the
of
belief
in
those
days
he
resumed
since
neither
of
us
accepted
the
challenge
was
amazing
something
quite
unknown
anywhere
in
the
world
it
was
so
sure
so
positive
no
mere
speculative
theories
i
mean
as
though
something
in
the
climate
the
exact
position
beneath
the
stars
the
attitude
of
this
particular
stretch
of
earth
in
relation
to
the
sun
thinned
the
veil
between
humanity
and
other
things
their
hierarchies
of
gods
you
know
were
not
mere
idols
animals
birds
monsters
and
all
typified
spiritual
forces
and
powers
that
influenced
their
daily
life
but
the
strong
thing
is
they
people
who
were
scientific
as
they
were
did
not
swallow
foolish
superstitions
they
made
colours
that
could
last
six
thousand
years
even
in
the
open
air
and
without
instruments
they
measured
accurately
an
enormously
difficult
and
involved
calculation
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
you
ve
been
to
denderah
he
suddenly
glanced
again
at
me
no
well
the
minds
that
realised
the
zodiacal
signs
could
hardly
believe
you
know
that
hathor
was
a
cow
isley
coughed
he
was
about
to
interrupt
but
before
he
could
find
words
moleson
was
off
again
some
new
quality
in
his
tone
and
manner
that
was
almost
aggressive
the
hints
he
offered
seemed
more
than
hints
there
was
a
strange
conviction
in
his
heart
i
think
he
was
skirting
a
bigger
thing
that
he
and
his
companion
knew
yet
that
his
real
object
was
to
see
in
how
far
i
was
open
to
attack
how
far
my
sympathy
might
be
with
them
i
became
aware
that
he
and
george
isley
shared
this
bigger
thing
it
was
based
i
felt
on
some
certain
knowledge
that
experiment
had
brought
them
think
of
the
grand
teaching
of
aknahton
that
young
pharaoh
who
regenerated
the
entire
land
and
brought
it
to
its
immense
prosperity
he
taught
the
worship
of
the
sun
but
not
of
the
visible
sun
the
deity
had
neither
form
nor
shape
the
great
disk
of
glory
was
but
the
manifestation
each
beneficent
ray
ending
in
a
hand
that
blessed
the
world
it
was
a
god
of
everlasting
energy
love
and
power
yet
men
could
know
it
at
first
hand
in
their
daily
lives
worshipping
it
at
dawn
and
sunset
with
passionate
devotion
no
anthropomorphic
idol
masqueraded
in
an
extraordinary
glow
was
about
him
as
he
said
it
the
same
minute
he
lowered
his
voice
shifting
the
key
perceptibly
he
kept
looking
up
at
me
through
eyelids
and
another
thing
they
wonderfully
knew
he
almost
whispered
was
that
with
the
precession
of
their
deity
across
the
equinoctial
changes
there
came
new
powers
down
into
the
world
of
men
each
cycle
each
zodiacal
sign
brought
its
special
powers
which
they
quickly
typified
in
the
monstrous
effigies
we
label
in
our
dull
museums
each
sign
took
some
two
thousand
years
to
traverse
each
sign
moreover
involved
a
change
in
human
consciousness
there
was
this
relation
between
the
heavens
and
the
human
heart
all
that
they
knew
while
the
sun
crawled
through
the
sign
of
taurus
it
was
the
bull
they
worshipped
with
aries
it
was
the
ram
that
coifed
their
granite
symbols
then
came
as
you
remember
with
pisces
the
great
new
arrival
when
already
they
sank
from
their
grand
zenith
and
the
fish
was
taken
as
the
emblem
of
the
changing
powers
which
the
christ
embodied
for
the
human
soul
they
held
echoed
the
changes
in
the
immense
journey
of
the
original
deity
who
is
its
source
across
the
zodiac
and
the
truth
of
as
above
so
below
remains
the
key
to
all
manifested
life
and
the
sun
just
entering
aquarius
new
powers
are
close
upon
the
world
the
old
that
which
has
been
for
two
thousand
years
again
is
crumbling
passing
dying
new
powers
and
a
new
consciousness
are
knocking
at
our
doors
it
is
a
time
of
change
it
is
also
he
leaned
forward
so
that
his
eyes
came
close
before
me
the
time
to
make
the
change
the
soul
can
choose
its
own
conditions
it
can
a
sudden
crash
smothered
the
rest
of
the
sentence
a
chair
had
fallen
with
a
clatter
upon
the
wooden
floor
where
the
carpet
left
it
bare
whether
isley
in
rising
had
stumbled
against
it
or
whether
he
had
purposely
knocked
it
over
i
could
not
say
i
only
knew
that
he
had
abruptly
risen
and
as
abruptly
sat
down
again
a
curious
feeling
came
to
me
that
the
sign
was
somehow
prearranged
it
was
so
sudden
his
voice
too
was
forced
i
thought
yes
but
we
can
do
without
all
that
moleson
he
interrupted
with
acute
abruptness
suppose
we
have
a
tune
viii
it
was
after
dinner
in
his
private
room
and
he
had
sat
very
silent
in
his
corner
until
this
sudden
outburst
moleson
got
up
quietly
without
a
word
and
moved
over
to
the
piano
i
saw
or
was
it
imagination
merely
a
new
expression
slide
upon
his
withered
face
he
meant
mischief
somewhere
from
that
instant
from
the
moment
he
rose
and
walked
over
the
thick
carpet
he
fascinated
me
the
atmosphere
his
talk
and
stories
had
brought
remained
his
lean
fingers
ran
over
the
keys
and
at
first
he
played
fragments
from
popular
musical
comedies
that
were
pleasant
enough
but
made
no
demand
upon
the
attention
i
heard
them
without
listening
i
was
thinking
of
another
thing
his
walk
for
the
way
he
moved
across
those
few
feet
of
carpet
had
power
in
it
he
looked
different
he
seemed
another
man
he
was
changed
i
saw
him
curiously
as
i
sometimes
now
saw
isley
too
bigger
in
some
manner
that
was
both
enchanting
and
oppressive
his
presence
from
that
moment
drew
my
imagination
as
by
an
air
of
authority
it
held
i
left
my
seat
in
the
far
corner
and
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
the
window
nearer
to
the
piano
isley
i
then
noticed
had
also
turned
to
watch
him
but
it
was
george
isley
not
quite
as
he
was
now
i
felt
rather
than
saw
the
change
both
men
had
subtly
altered
they
seemed
extended
their
outlines
shadowy
isley
alert
and
anxious
glanced
up
at
the
player
his
mind
of
earlier
years
for
the
expression
of
his
face
was
plain
following
the
light
music
yet
with
difficulty
that
involved
effort
almost
struggle
play
that
again
will
you
i
heard
him
say
from
time
to
time
he
was
trying
to
take
hold
of
it
to
climb
back
to
a
condition
where
that
music
had
linked
him
to
the
present
to
seize
a
mental
structure
that
was
gone
to
grip
hold
tightly
of
it
only
to
find
that
it
was
too
far
forgotten
and
too
fragile
it
would
not
bear
him
i
am
sure
of
it
and
i
can
swear
i
divined
his
mood
he
fought
to
realise
himself
as
he
had
been
but
in
vain
in
his
dim
corner
opposite
i
watched
him
closely
the
big
black
blüthner
blocked
itself
between
us
above
it
swayed
the
outline
lean
and
half
shadowy
of
moleson
as
he
played
a
faint
whisper
floated
through
the
room
you
are
in
nowhere
else
could
this
queer
feeling
of
presentiment
of
anticipation
have
gained
a
footing
so
easily
i
was
aware
of
intense
emotion
in
all
three
of
us
the
least
reminder
of
seemed
ugly
i
longed
for
some
ancient
forgotten
splendour
that
was
lost
the
scene
fixed
my
attention
very
steadily
for
i
was
aware
of
something
deliberate
and
calculated
on
moleson
s
part
the
thing
was
well
considered
in
his
mind
intention
only
half
concealed
it
was
egypt
he
interpreted
by
sound
expressing
what
in
him
was
true
then
observing
its
effect
as
he
led
us
cleverly
towards
the
past
beginning
with
the
present
he
played
persuasively
with
penetration
with
insistent
meaning
too
he
had
that
touch
which
conjured
up
real
atmosphere
and
at
first
that
atmosphere
termed
modern
he
rendered
vividly
the
note
of
london
passing
from
the
jingles
of
musical
comedy
nervous
and
sensuous
tango
dances
into
the
higher
strains
of
concert
rooms
and
cultured
circles
yet
not
too
abruptly
most
dexterously
he
shifted
the
level
and
with
it
our
emotion
i
recognised
as
in
a
parody
various
thrills
the
tumult
of
strauss
the
pagan
sweetness
of
primitive
debussy
the
weirdness
and
ecstasy
of
metaphysical
scriabin
the
composite
note
of
in
both
extremes
he
brought
into
this
private
of
the
desert
hotel
while
george
isley
listening
keenly
fidgeted
in
his
chair
d
un
faune
said
moleson
dreamily
answering
the
question
as
to
what
he
played
debussy
s
you
know
and
the
thing
before
it
was
from
til
eulenspiegel
strauss
of
he
drawled
swaying
slowly
with
the
rhythm
and
leaving
pauses
between
the
words
his
attention
was
not
wholly
on
his
listener
and
in
the
voice
was
a
quality
that
increased
my
uneasy
apprehension
i
felt
distress
for
isley
somewhere
something
it
seemed
was
coming
moleson
brought
it
unconsciously
in
his
walk
it
now
appeared
consciously
in
his
music
and
it
came
from
what
was
underground
in
him
a
charm
a
subtle
change
stole
oddly
over
the
room
it
stole
over
my
heart
as
well
some
power
of
estimating
left
me
as
though
my
mind
were
slipping
backwards
and
losing
familiar
common
standards
the
true
modern
note
in
it
isn
t
there
he
drawled
cleverness
i
think
intellectual
surface
ingenuity
no
depth
or
permanence
just
the
sensational
brilliance
of
he
turned
and
stared
at
me
fixedly
an
instant
nothing
he
added
impressively
it
tells
everything
it
knows
because
it
s
small
enough
and
the
room
turned
pettier
as
he
said
it
another
bigger
shadow
draped
its
little
walls
through
the
open
windows
came
a
stealthy
gesture
of
eternity
the
atmosphere
stretched
visibly
moleson
was
playing
a
marvellous
fragment
from
scriabin
s
it
sounded
thin
and
shallow
this
modern
music
all
of
it
was
out
of
place
and
trivial
it
was
almost
ridiculous
the
scale
of
our
emotion
changed
insensibly
into
a
deeper
thing
that
has
no
name
in
dictionaries
being
of
another
age
and
i
glanced
at
the
windows
where
stone
columns
framed
dim
sections
of
great
egypt
listening
outside
there
was
no
moon
only
deep
draughts
of
stars
blazed
hanging
in
the
sky
i
thought
with
awe
of
the
mysterious
knowledge
that
vanished
people
had
of
these
stars
and
of
the
sun
s
huge
journey
through
the
zodiac
and
with
astonishing
suddenness
as
of
dream
there
rose
a
pictured
image
against
that
starlit
sky
lifted
into
the
air
between
heaven
and
earth
i
saw
float
swiftly
past
a
panorama
of
the
stately
temples
led
by
denderah
edfu
abou
simbel
it
paused
it
hovered
it
disappeared
leaving
incalculable
solemnity
behind
it
in
the
air
it
vanished
and
to
see
so
vast
a
thing
move
at
that
easy
yet
unhasting
speed
unhinged
some
sense
of
measurement
in
me
it
was
of
course
i
assured
myself
mere
memory
objectified
owing
to
something
that
the
music
summoned
yet
the
apprehension
rose
in
me
that
the
whole
of
egypt
presently
would
stream
past
in
similar
fashion
egypt
as
she
was
in
the
zenith
of
her
unrecoverable
past
behind
the
tinkling
of
the
modern
piano
passed
the
rustling
of
a
multitude
the
tramping
of
countless
feet
on
sand
it
was
singularly
vivid
it
arrested
in
me
something
that
normally
went
flowing
and
when
i
turned
my
head
towards
the
room
to
call
attention
to
my
strange
experience
the
eyes
of
moleson
i
saw
were
laid
upon
my
own
he
stared
at
me
the
light
in
them
transfixed
me
and
i
understood
that
the
illusion
was
due
in
some
manner
to
his
evocation
isley
rose
at
the
same
moment
from
his
chair
the
thing
i
had
vaguely
been
expecting
had
shifted
closer
and
the
same
moment
the
musician
abruptly
changed
his
key
you
may
like
this
better
he
murmured
half
to
himself
but
in
tones
he
somehow
made
echoing
it
s
more
suited
to
the
there
was
a
resonance
in
the
voice
as
though
it
emerged
from
hollows
underground
the
other
seems
almost
sacrilegious
and
his
voice
drawled
off
in
the
rhythm
of
slower
modulations
that
he
played
it
had
grown
muffled
there
was
an
impression
too
that
he
did
not
strike
the
piano
but
that
the
music
issued
from
himself
place
what
place
asked
isley
quickly
his
head
turned
sharply
as
he
spoke
his
tone
in
its
remoteness
made
me
tremble
the
musician
laughed
to
himself
i
meant
that
this
hotel
seems
really
an
impertinence
he
murmured
leaning
down
upon
the
notes
he
played
upon
so
softly
and
so
well
and
that
it
s
but
the
thinnest
kind
of
pretence
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
we
are
in
the
desert
really
the
colossi
are
outside
and
all
the
emptied
temples
or
ought
to
be
he
added
raising
his
tone
abruptly
with
a
glance
at
me
he
straightened
up
and
stared
out
into
the
starry
sky
past
george
isley
s
shoulders
that
he
exclaimed
with
betraying
vehemence
is
where
we
are
and
what
we
play
to
his
voice
suddenly
increased
there
was
a
roar
in
it
that
he
repeated
is
the
thing
that
takes
our
hearts
the
volume
of
intonation
was
astonishing
for
the
way
he
uttered
the
monosyllable
suddenly
revealed
the
man
beneath
the
outer
sheath
of
cynicism
and
laughter
explained
his
heartlessness
his
secret
stream
of
life
he
too
was
soul
and
body
in
the
past
that
revealed
more
than
pages
of
descriptive
phrases
his
heart
lived
in
the
temple
aisles
his
mind
unearthed
forgotten
knowledge
his
soul
had
clothed
itself
anew
in
the
seductive
glory
of
antiquity
he
dwelt
with
a
quickening
magic
of
existence
in
the
reconstructed
splendour
of
what
most
term
only
ruins
he
and
george
isley
together
had
revivified
a
power
that
enticed
them
backwards
but
whereas
the
latter
struggled
still
the
former
had
already
made
his
permanent
home
there
the
faculty
in
me
that
saw
the
vision
of
streaming
temples
saw
also
this
remorselessly
definite
moleson
himself
sat
naked
at
that
piano
i
saw
him
clearly
then
he
no
longer
masqueraded
behind
his
sneers
and
laughter
he
too
had
long
ago
surrendered
lost
himself
gone
out
and
from
the
place
his
soul
now
dwelt
in
he
watched
george
isley
sinking
down
to
join
him
he
lived
in
ancient
subterranean
egypt
this
great
hotel
stood
precariously
on
the
merest
upper
crust
of
desert
a
thousand
tombs
a
hundred
temples
lay
outside
within
reach
almost
of
our
very
voices
moleson
was
merged
with
this
intuition
flashed
upon
me
like
the
picture
in
the
sky
and
both
were
true
and
meanwhile
this
other
thing
he
played
had
a
surge
of
power
in
it
impossible
to
describe
it
was
sombre
huge
and
solemn
it
conveyed
the
power
that
his
walk
conveyed
there
was
distance
in
it
but
a
distance
not
of
space
alone
a
remoteness
of
time
breathed
through
it
with
that
strange
sadness
and
melancholy
yearning
that
enormous
interval
brings
it
marched
but
very
far
away
it
held
refrains
that
assumed
the
rhythms
of
a
multitude
the
centuries
muted
it
sang
but
the
singing
was
underground
in
passages
that
fine
sand
muffled
lost
wandering
winds
sighed
through
it
booming
the
contrast
after
the
modern
cheaper
music
was
dislocating
yet
the
change
had
been
quite
naturally
effected
it
would
sound
empty
and
monotonous
elsewhere
in
london
for
instance
i
heard
moleson
drawling
as
he
swayed
to
and
fro
but
here
it
is
big
and
splendid
true
you
hear
what
i
mean
he
added
gravely
you
understand
what
is
it
asked
isley
thickly
before
i
could
say
a
word
i
forget
exactly
it
has
tears
in
it
more
than
i
can
the
end
of
his
sentence
died
away
in
his
throat
moleson
did
not
look
at
him
as
he
answered
he
looked
at
me
you
surely
ought
to
know
he
replied
the
voice
rising
and
falling
as
though
the
rhythm
forced
it
you
have
heard
it
all
before
that
chant
from
the
ritual
we
isley
sprang
up
and
stopped
him
i
did
not
hear
the
sentence
complete
an
extraordinary
thought
blazed
into
me
that
the
voices
of
both
men
were
not
quite
their
own
i
fancied
wild
impossible
as
it
sounds
that
i
heard
the
twin
colossi
singing
to
each
other
in
the
dawn
stupendous
ideas
sprang
past
me
leaping
it
seemed
as
though
eternal
symbols
of
the
cosmos
discovered
and
worshipped
in
this
ancient
land
leaped
into
awful
life
my
consciousness
became
enveloping
i
had
the
distressing
feeling
that
ages
slipped
out
of
place
and
took
me
with
them
they
dominated
me
they
rushed
me
off
my
feet
like
water
i
was
drawn
backwards
i
too
was
changing
being
changed
i
remember
said
isley
softly
a
reverence
of
worship
in
his
voice
but
there
was
anguish
in
it
too
and
pity
he
let
the
present
go
completely
from
him
the
last
strands
severed
with
a
wrench
of
pain
i
imagined
i
heard
his
soul
pass
weeping
far
away
below
i

sing
it
murmured
moleson
for
the
voice
is
necessary
the
sound
and
rhythm
are
utterly
divine
ix
and
forthwith
his
voice
began
a
series
of
cadences
that
seemed
somehow
the
of
every
tongue
that
ever
was
a
spell
came
over
me
i
could
touch
and
feel
a
web
encompassed
me
my
arms
and
feet
became
entangled
a
veil
of
fine
threads
wove
across
my
eyes
the
enthralling
power
of
the
rhythm
produced
some
magical
movement
in
the
soul
i
was
aware
of
life
everywhere
about
me
far
and
near
in
the
dwellings
of
the
dead
as
also
in
the
corridors
of
the
iron
hills
thebes
stood
erect
and
memphis
teemed
upon
the
river
banks
for
the
modern
world
fell
swaying
at
this
sound
that
restored
the
past
and
in
this
past
both
men
before
me
lived
and
had
their
being
the
storm
of
present
life
passed
o
er
their
heads
while
they
dwelt
underground
obliterated
gone
upon
the
wave
of
sound
they
went
down
into
their
recovered
kingdom
i
shivered
moved
vigorously
half
rose
up
then
instantly
sank
back
again
resigned
and
helpless
for
i
entered
by
their
side
it
seemed
the
conditions
of
their
strange
captivity
my
thoughts
my
feelings
my
point
of
view
were
transplanted
to
another
centre
consciousness
shifted
in
me
i
saw
things
from
another
s
point
of
view
antiquity
s
the
present
forgotten
but
the
past
supreme
i
lost
reality
our
room
became
a
picture
seen
in
a
drop
of
water
while
this
subterranean
world
replacing
it
turned
immense
my
heart
took
on
the
gigantic
leisured
stride
of
what
had
been
proportions
grew
size
captured
me
and
magnitude
turned
monstrous
swept
mere
measurement
away
some
hand
of
golden
sunshine
picked
me
up
and
set
me
in
the
quivering
web
beside
those
other
two
i
heard
the
rustle
of
the
settling
threads
i
heard
the
shuffling
of
the
feet
in
sand
i
heard
the
whispers
in
the
dwellings
of
the
dead
behind
the
monotony
of
this
sacerdotal
music
i
heard
them
in
their
dim
carved
chambers
the
ancient
galleries
were
awake
the
life
of
unremembered
ages
stirred
in
multitudes
about
me
the
reality
of
so
incredible
an
experience
evaporates
through
the
stream
of
language
i
can
only
affirm
this
singular
proof
that
the
deepest
most
satisfying
knowledge
the
present
could
offer
seemed
insignificant
beside
some
stalwart
majesty
of
the
past
that
utterly
usurped
it
this
modern
room
holding
a
piano
and
two
figures
of
appeared
as
a
paltry
miniature
pinned
against
a
vast
transparent
curtain
whose
foreground
was
thick
with
symbols
of
temple
sphinx
and
pyramid
but
whose
background
of
stupendous
hanging
grey
slid
off
towards
a
splendour
where
the
cities
of
the
dead
shook
off
their
sand
and
thronged
space
to
its
ultimate
horizons
the
stars
the
entire
universe
vibrating
and
alive
became
involved
in
it
long
periods
of
time
slipped
past
me
i
seemed
living
ages
ago
i
was
living
backwards
the
size
and
eternity
of
egypt
took
me
easily
there
was
an
overwhelming
grandeur
in
it
that
elbowed
out
all
present
standards
the
whole
place
towered
and
stood
up
the
desert
reared
the
very
horizons
lifted
majestic
figures
of
granite
rose
above
the
hotel
great
faces
hovered
and
drove
past
huge
arms
reached
up
to
pluck
the
stars
and
set
them
in
the
ceilings
of
the
labyrinthine
tombs
the
colossal
meaning
of
the
ancient
land
emerged
through
all
its
ruined
details
reconstructed
burningly
alive
it
became
at
length
unbearable
i
longed
for
the
droning
sounds
to
cease
for
the
rhythm
to
lessen
its
prodigious
sweep
my
heart
cried
out
for
the
gold
of
the
sunlight
on
the
desert
for
the
sweet
air
by
the
river
s
banks
for
the
violet
lights
upon
the
hills
at
dawn
and
i
resisted
i
made
an
effort
to
return
your
chant
is
horrible
for
god
s
sake
let
s
have
an
arab
song
or
the
music
of
the
effort
was
intense
the
result
was
nothing
i
swear
i
used
these
words
i
heard
the
actual
sound
of
my
voice
if
no
one
else
did
for
i
remember
that
it
was
pitiful
in
the
way
great
space
devoured
it
making
of
its
appreciable
volume
the
merest
whisper
as
of
some
bird
or
insect
cry
but
the
figure
that
i
took
for
moleson
instead
of
answer
or
acknowledgment
merely
grew
and
grew
as
things
grow
in
a
fairy
tale
i
hardly
know
i
certainly
can
not
say
that
dwindling
part
of
me
which
offered
comments
on
the
entire
occurrence
noted
this
extraordinary
effect
as
though
it
happened
naturally
that
moleson
himself
was
marvellously
increasing
the
entire
spell
became
operative
all
at
once
i
experienced
both
the
delight
of
complete
abandonment
and
the
terror
of
letting
go
what
seemed
real
i
understood
moleson
s
sham
laughter
and
the
subtle
resignation
of
george
isley
and
an
amazing
thought
flashed
birdlike
across
my
changing
consciousness
that
this
resurrection
into
the
past
this
rebirth
of
the
spirit
which
they
sought
involved
taking
upon
themselves
the
guise
of
these
ancient
symbols
each
in
turn
as
the
embryo
assumes
each
evolutionary
stage
below
it
before
the
human
semblance
is
attained
so
the
souls
of
those
two
adventurers
took
upon
themselves
the
various
emblems
of
that
intense
belief
the
devout
worshipper
takes
on
the
qualities
of
his
deity
they
wore
the
entire
series
of
the
gods
so
potently
that
i
perceived
them
and
even
objectified
them
by
my
senses
the
present
was
their
stage
to
enter
the
past
they
were
being
born
again
but
it
was
not
moleson
s
semblance
alone
that
took
on
this
awful
change
both
faces
scaled
to
the
measure
of
egypt
s
outstanding
quality
of
size
became
in
this
little
modern
room
distressingly
immense
distorting
mirrors
can
suggest
no
simile
for
the
symmetry
of
proportion
was
not
injured
i
lost
their
human
physiognomies
i
saw
their
thoughts
their
feelings
their
augmented
altered
hearts
the
thing
that
egypt
put
there
while
she
stole
their
love
from
modern
life
there
grew
an
awful
stateliness
upon
them
that
was
huge
mysterious
and
motionless
as
stone
for
moleson
s
narrow
face
at
first
turned
in
the
semblance
of
the
sinister
deity
horus
only
stretched
to
tower
above
the
piano
it
was
keen
and
sly
and
monstrous
after
prey
while
a
swiftness
of
the
sunrise
leaped
from
both
the
brilliant
eyes
george
isley
equally
immense
of
outline
was
in
general
presentment
more
magnificent
a
breadth
of
the
sphinx
about
his
spreading
shoulders
and
in
his
countenance
an
inscrutable
power
of
calm
temple
images
these
were
the
first
signs
of
obsession
but
others
followed
in
rapid
series
like
upon
a
screen
the
ancient
symbols
flashed
one
after
another
across
these
two
extended
human
faces
and
were
gone
disentanglement
became
impossible
the
successive
signatures
seemed
almost
superimposed
as
in
a
composite
photograph
each
appearing
and
vanished
before
recognition
was
even
possible
while
i
interpreted
the
inner
alchemy
by
means
of
outer
tokens
familiar
to
my
senses
egypt
possessing
them
expressed
herself
thus
marvellously
in
their
physical
aspect
using
the
symbols
of
her
intense
regenerative
power
the
changes
merged
with
such
swiftness
into
one
another
that
i
did
not
seize
the
half
of
them
till
finally
the
procession
culminated
in
a
single
one
that
remained
fixed
awfully
upon
them
both
the
entire
series
merged
i
was
aware
of
this
single
masterful
image
which
summed
up
all
the
others
in
sublime
repose
the
gigantic
thing
rose
up
in
this
incredible
statue
form
the
spirit
of
egypt
synthesised
in
this
monstrous
symbol
obliterated
them
both
i
saw
the
seated
figures
of
the
grim
colossi
dipped
in
sand
night
over
them
waiting
for
the
dawn
x
i
made
a
violent
effort
then
at
an
effort
to
focus
my
mind
upon
the
present
and
searching
for
moleson
and
george
isley
its
nearest
details
i
was
aware
that
i
could
not
find
them
the
familiar
figures
of
my
two
companions
were
not
discoverable
i
saw
it
as
plainly
as
i
also
saw
that
ludicrous
wee
piano
for
a
moment
but
the
moment
remained
the
eternity
of
egypt
stayed
for
that
lonely
and
terrific
pair
had
stooped
their
shoulders
and
bowed
their
awful
heads
they
were
in
the
room
they
imaged
forth
the
power
of
the
everlasting
past
through
the
little
structures
of
two
human
worshippers
room
walls
and
ceiling
fled
away
sand
and
the
open
sky
replaced
them
the
two
of
them
rose
side
by
side
before
my
bursting
eyes
i
knew
not
where
to
look
like
some
child
who
confronts
its
giants
upon
the
nursery
floor
i
turned
to
stone
unable
to
think
or
move
i
stared
sight
wrenched
itself
to
find
the
men
familiar
to
it
but
found
instead
this
symbolising
vision
i
could
not
see
them
properly
their
faces
were
spread
with
hugeness
their
features
lost
in
some
uncommon
magnitude
their
shoulders
necks
and
arms
grown
vast
upon
the
air
as
with
the
desert
there
was
physiognomy
yet
no
personal
expression
the
human
thing
all
drowned
within
the
mass
of
battered
stone
i
discovered
neither
cheeks
nor
mouth
nor
jaw
but
ruined
eyes
and
lips
of
broken
granite
huge
motionless
mysterious
egypt
informed
them
and
took
them
to
herself
and
between
us
curiously
presented
in
some
false
perspective
i
saw
the
little
symbol
of
the
blüthner
piano
it
was
appalling
i
knew
a
second
of
majestic
horror
i
blenched
hot
and
cold
gushed
through
me
strength
left
me
power
of
speech
and
movement
too
as
in
a
moment
of
complete
paralysis
the
spell
moreover
was
not
within
the
room
alone
it
was
outside
and
everywhere
the
past
stood
massed
about
the
very
walls
of
the
hotel
distance
as
well
as
time
stepped
nearer
that
chanting
summoned
the
gigantic
items
in
all
their
ancient
splendour
the
shadowy
concourse
grouped
itself
upon
the
sand
about
us
and
i
was
aware
that
the
great
army
shifted
noiselessly
into
place
that
pyramids
soared
and
towered
that
deities
of
stone
stood
by
that
temples
ranged
themselves
in
reconstructed
beauty
grave
as
the
night
of
time
whence
they
emerged
and
that
the
outline
of
the
sphinx
motionless
but
aggressive
piled
its
dim
bulk
upon
the
atmosphere
immensity
answered
to
immensity
there
were
vast
intervals
of
time
and
there
were
reaches
of
enormous
distance
yet
all
happened
in
a
moment
and
all
happened
within
a
little
space
it
was
now
and
here
eternity
whispered
in
every
second
as
in
every
grain
of
sand
yet
while
aware
of
so
many
stupendous
details
all
at
once
i
was
really
aware
of
one
thing
only
that
the
spirit
of
ancient
egypt
faced
me
in
these
two
terrific
figures
and
that
my
consciousness
stretched
painfully
yet
gloriously
included
all
as
she
also
unquestionably
included
them
and
me
for
it
seemed
i
shared
the
likeness
of
my
two
companions
some
lesser
symbol
though
of
similar
kind
obsessed
me
too
i
tried
to
move
but
my
feet
were
set
in
stone
my
arms
lay
fixed
my
body
was
embedded
in
the
rock
sand
beat
sharply
upon
my
outer
surface
urged
upwards
in
little
flurries
by
a
chilly
wind
there
was
nothing
felt
i
the
rattle
of
the
scattering
grains
against
my
hardened
body
and
we
waited
for
the
dawn
for
the
resurrection
of
that
unchanging
deity
who
was
the
source
and
inspiration
of
all
our
glorious
life
the
air
grew
keen
and
fresh
in
the
distance
a
line
of
sky
turned
from
pink
to
violet
and
gold
a
delicate
rose
next
flushed
the
desert
a
few
pale
stars
hung
fainting
overhead
and
the
wind
that
brought
the
sunrise
was
already
stirring
the
whole
land
paused
upon
the
coming
of
its
mighty
god
into
the
pause
there
rose
a
curious
sound
for
which
we
had
been
waiting
for
it
came
familiarly
as
though
expected
i
could
have
sworn
at
first
that
it
was
george
isley
who
sang
answering
his
companion
there
beat
behind
its
great
volume
the
same
note
and
rhythm
only
so
prodigiously
increased
that
while
moleson
s
chant
had
waked
it
it
now
was
independent
and
apart
the
resonant
vibrations
of
what
he
sang
had
reached
down
into
the
places
where
it
slept
uttered
synchronously
egypt
spoke
there
was
in
it
the
deep
muttering
as
of
a
thousand
drums
as
though
the
desert
uttered
in
prodigious
syllables
i
listened
while
my
heart
of
stone
stood
still
there
were
two
voices
in
the
sky
spoke
tremendously
with
each
other
in
the
dawn
so
easily
we
still
remain
possessors
of
the
land
while
the
centuries
roar
past
us
and
are
soft
with
power
the
syllables
rolled
forth
yet
with
a
booming
depth
as
though
caverns
underground
produced
them
our
silence
is
disturbed
pass
on
with
the
multitude
towards
the
east
still
in
the
dawn
we
sing
the
wisdom
they
shall
hear
our
speech
yet
shall
not
hear
it
with
their
ears
of
flesh
at
dawn
our
words
go
forth
searching
the
distances
of
sand
and
time
across
the
sunlight
at
dusk
they
return
as
upon
eagles
wings
entering
again
our
lips
of
stone
each
century
one
syllable
yet
no
sentence
yet
complete
while
our
lips
are
broken
with
the
utterance
it
seemed
that
hours
and
months
and
years
went
past
me
while
i
listened
in
my
sandy
bed
the
fragments
died
far
away
then
sounded
very
close
again
it
was
as
though
mountain
peaks
sang
to
one
another
above
clouds
wind
caught
the
muffled
roar
away
wind
brought
it
back
then
in
a
hollow
pause
that
lasted
years
conveying
marvellously
the
passage
of
long
periods
i
heard
the
utterance
more
clearly
the
leisured
roll
of
the
great
voice
swept
through
me
like
a
flood
we
wait
and
watch
and
listen
in
our
loneliness
we
do
not
close
our
eyes
the
moon
and
stars
sail
past
us
and
our
river
finds
the
sea
we
bring
eternity
upon
your
broken
lives
we
see
you
build
your
little
lines
of
steel
across
our
territory
behind
the
thin
white
smoke
we
hear
the
whistle
of
your
messengers
of
iron
through
the
air
the
nations
rise
and
pass
the
empires
flutter
westwards
and
are
gone
the
sun
grows
older
and
the
stars
turn
pale
winds
shift
the
line
of
the
horizons
and
our
river
moves
its
bed
but
we
everlasting
and
unchangeable
remain
of
water
sand
and
fire
is
our
essential
being
yet
built
within
the
universal
air
there
is
no
pause
in
life
there
is
no
break
in
death
the
changes
bring
no
end
the
sun
returns
there
is
eternal
resurrection
but
our
kingdom
is
underground
in
shadow
unrealised
of
your
little
day
come
come
the
temples
still
are
crowded
and
our
desert
blesses
you
our
river
takes
your
feet
our
sand
shall
purify
and
the
fire
of
our
god
shall
burn
you
sweetly
into
wisdom
come
then
and
worship
for
the
time
draws
near
it
is
the
dawn
the
voices
died
down
into
depths
that
the
sand
of
ages
muffled
while
the
flaming
dawn
of
the
east
rushed
up
the
sky
sunrise
the
great
symbol
of
life
s
endless
resurrection
was
at
hand
about
me
in
immense
but
shadowy
array
stood
the
whole
of
ancient
egypt
hanging
breathlessly
upon
the
moment
of
adoration
no
longer
stern
and
terrible
in
the
splendour
of
their
long
neglect
the
effigies
rose
erect
with
passionate
glory
a
forest
of
stately
stone
their
granite
lips
were
parted
and
their
ancient
eyes
were
wide
all
faced
the
east
and
the
sun
drew
nearer
to
the
rim
of
the
attentive
desert
xi
emotion
there
seemed
none
in
the
sense
that
knew
feeling
i
knew
if
anything
the
ultimate
secrets
of
two
primitive
sensations
joy
and
awe
the
dawn
grew
swiftly
brighter
there
was
gold
as
though
the
sands
of
nubia
spilt
their
brilliance
on
each
shining
detail
there
was
glory
as
though
the
retreating
tide
of
stars
spilt
their
light
foam
upon
the
world
and
there
was
passion
as
though
the
beliefs
of
all
the
ages
floated
back
with
abandonment
into
the
sun
ruined
egypt
merged
into
a
single
temple
of
elemental
vastness
whose
floor
was
the
empty
desert
but
whose
walls
rose
to
the
stars
abruptly
then
chanting
and
rhythm
ceased
they
dipped
below
sand
muffled
them
and
the
sun
looked
down
upon
its
ancient
world
a
radiant
warmth
poured
through
me
i
found
that
i
could
move
my
limbs
again
a
sense
of
triumphant
life
ran
through
my
stony
frame
for
one
passing
second
i
heard
the
shower
of
gritty
particles
upon
my
surface
like
sand
blown
upwards
by
a
gust
of
wind
but
this
time
i
could
the
sting
of
it
upon
my
skin
it
passed
the
drenching
heat
bathed
me
from
head
to
foot
while
stony
insensibility
gave
place
with
returning
consciousness
to
flesh
and
blood
the
sun
had
risen
i
was
alive
but
i
was
changed
it
seemed
i
opened
my
eyes
an
immense
relief
was
in
me
i
turned
i
drew
a
deep
refreshing
breath
i
stretched
one
leg
upon
a
thick
green
carpet
something
had
left
me
another
thing
had
returned
i
sat
up
conscious
of
welcome
release
of
freedom
of
escape
there
was
some
violent
disorganising
break
i
found
myself
i
found
moleson
i
found
george
isley
too
he
had
got
shifted
in
that
room
without
my
being
aware
of
it
isley
had
risen
he
came
upon
me
like
a
blow
i
saw
him
move
his
arms
fire
flashed
from
below
his
hands
and
i
realised
then
that
he
was
turning
on
the
electric
lights
they
emerged
from
different
points
along
the
walls
in
the
alcove
beneath
the
ceiling
by
the
and
one
had
just
that
minute
blazed
into
my
eyes
from
a
bracket
close
above
me
i
was
back
again
in
the
present
among
modern
things
but
while
most
of
the
details
presented
themselves
gradually
to
my
recovered
senses
isley
returned
with
this
curious
effect
of
speed
and
distance
like
a
blow
upon
the
mind
from
great
height
and
from
prodigious
size
he
dropped
i
seemed
to
find
him
rushing
at
me
moleson
was
simply
there
there
was
no
speed
or
sudden
change
in
him
as
with
the
other
motionless
at
the
piano
his
long
thin
hands
lay
down
upon
the
keys
yet
did
not
strike
them
but
isley
came
back
like
lightning
into
the
little
room
signs
of
the
monstrous
obsession
still
about
his
altering
features
there
was
battle
and
worship
mingled
in
his
eyes
his
mouth
though
set
was
smiling
with
a
shudder
i
positively
saw
the
vastness
slipping
from
his
face
as
shadows
from
a
stretch
of
broken
cliff
there
was
this
awful
mingling
of
proportions
the
colossal
power
that
had
resumed
his
being
drew
slowly
inwards
there
was
collapse
in
him
and
upon
the
sunburned
cheek
of
his
rugged
face
i
saw
a
tear
poignant
revulsion
caught
me
then
for
a
moment
the
present
showed
itself
in
rags
the
reduction
of
scale
was
painful
i
yearned
for
the
splendour
that
was
gone
yet
still
seemed
so
hauntingly
almost
within
reach
the
cheapness
of
the
hotel
room
the
glaring
ugliness
of
its
tinsel
decoration
the
baseness
of
ideals
where
utility
instead
of
beauty
gain
instead
of
worship
governed
life
this
with
the
dwindled
aspect
of
my
companions
to
the
insignificance
of
marionettes
brought
a
hungry
pain
that
was
at
first
intolerable
in
the
glare
of
light
i
noticed
the
small
round
face
of
the
portable
clock
upon
the
mantelpiece
showing
eleven
moleson
had
been
two
hours
at
the
piano
and
this
measuring
faculty
of
my
mind
completed
the
disillusionment
i
was
indeed
back
among
present
things
the
mechanical
spirit
of
imprisoned
me
again
for
a
considerable
interval
we
neither
moved
nor
spoke
the
sudden
change
left
the
emotions
in
confusion
we
had
leaped
from
a
height
from
the
top
of
the
pyramid
from
a
star
and
the
crash
of
landing
scattered
thought
i
stole
a
glance
at
isley
wondering
vaguely
why
he
was
there
at
all
the
look
of
resignation
had
replaced
the
power
in
his
face
the
tear
was
brushed
away
there
was
no
struggle
in
him
now
no
sign
of
resistance
there
was
abandonment
only
he
seemed
insignificant
the
real
george
isley
was
elsewhere
he
himself
had
not
returned
by
jerks
as
it
were
and
by
awkward
stages
then
we
all
three
came
back
to
common
things
again
i
found
that
we
were
talking
ordinarily
asking
each
other
questions
answering
lighting
cigarettes
and
all
the
rest
moleson
played
some
commonplace
chords
upon
the
piano
while
he
leaned
back
listlessly
in
his
chair
putting
in
sentences
now
and
again
and
chatting
idly
to
whichever
of
us
would
listen
and
isley
came
slowly
across
the
room
towards
me
holding
out
cigarettes
his
dark
brown
face
had
shadows
on
it
he
looked
exhausted
worn
like
some
soldier
broken
in
the
wars
you
liked
it
i
heard
his
thin
voice
asking
there
was
no
interest
no
expression
it
was
not
the
real
isley
who
spoke
it
was
the
little
part
of
him
that
had
come
back
he
smiled
like
a
marvellous
automaton
mechanically
i
took
the
cigarette
he
offered
me
thinking
confusedly
what
answer
i
could
make
it
s
irresistible
i
murmured
i
understand
that
it
s
easier
to
sweeter
as
well
he
whispered
with
a
sigh
and
very
wonderful
xii
the
hand
that
lit
my
cigarette
i
saw
was
trembling
a
desire
to
do
something
violent
woke
in
me
suddenly
to
move
energetically
to
push
or
drive
something
away
what
was
it
i
asked
abruptly
in
a
louder
voice
intended
for
the
man
at
the
piano
such
a
performance
upon
others
without
first
asking
their
permission
seems
to
me
unpermissible
it
s
and
it
was
moleson
who
replied
he
ignored
the
end
of
my
sentence
as
though
he
had
not
heard
it
he
strolled
over
to
our
side
taking
a
cigarette
and
pressing
it
carefully
into
shape
between
his
long
thin
fingers
you
may
well
ask
he
answered
quietly
but
it
s
not
so
easy
to
tell
we
discovered
it
he
nodded
towards
isley
two
years
ago
in
the
it
lay
beside
a
priest
a
very
important
personage
apparently
and
was
part
of
the
ritual
he
used
in
the
worship
of
the
sun
in
the
museum
now
you
can
see
it
any
day
at
the
boulak
it
is
simply
labelled
hymn
to
the
period
was
aknahton
the
words
yes
put
in
isley
who
was
listening
closely
the
words
repeated
moleson
in
a
curious
tone
there
no
words
it
s
all
really
a
manipulation
of
the
vowel
sounds
and
the
rhythm
or
chanting
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
i
i
invented
myself
the
egyptians
did
not
write
their
music
you
he
suddenly
searched
my
face
a
moment
with
questioning
eyes
any
words
you
heard
he
said
or
thought
you
heard
were
merely
your
own
i
stared
at
him
making
no
rejoinder
they
made
use
of
what
they
called
a
in
their
rituals
he
went
on
and
it
consisted
entirely
of
vowel
sounds
there
were
no
consonants
for
vowel
sounds
you
see
run
on
for
ever
without
end
or
beginning
whereas
consonants
interrupt
their
flow
and
break
it
up
and
limit
it
a
consonant
has
no
sound
of
its
own
at
all
real
language
is
we
stood
a
moment
smoking
in
silence
i
understood
then
that
this
thing
moleson
had
done
was
based
on
definite
knowledge
he
had
rendered
some
fragment
of
an
ancient
ritual
he
and
isley
had
unearthed
together
and
while
he
knew
its
effect
upon
the
latter
he
chanced
it
on
myself
not
otherwise
i
feel
could
it
have
influenced
me
in
the
extraordinary
way
it
did
in
the
faith
and
poetry
of
a
nation
lies
its
and
the
gigantic
faith
of
egypt
blazed
behind
the
rhythm
of
that
long
monotonous
chant
there
were
blood
and
heart
and
nerves
in
it
millions
had
heard
it
sung
millions
had
wept
and
prayed
and
yearned
it
was
ensouled
by
the
passion
of
that
marvellous
civilisation
that
loved
the
godhead
of
the
sun
and
that
now
hid
waiting
but
still
alive
below
the
ground
the
majestic
faith
of
ancient
egypt
poured
up
with
it
that
tremendous
burning
elaboration
of
the
and
of
eternity
that
was
the
pivot
of
those
spacious
days
for
centuries
vast
multitudes
led
by
their
royal
priests
had
uttered
this
very
form
and
ritual
believed
it
lived
it
felt
it
the
rising
of
the
sun
remained
its
climax
its
spiritual
power
still
clung
to
the
great
ruined
symbols
the
faith
of
a
buried
civilisation
had
burned
back
into
the
present
and
into
our
hearts
as
well
and
a
curious
respect
for
the
man
who
was
able
to
produce
this
effect
upon
two
modern
minds
crept
over
me
and
mingled
with
the
repulsion
that
i
felt
i
looked
furtively
at
his
withered
features
he
wore
some
vague
and
shadowy
impress
still
of
what
had
just
been
in
him
there
was
a
stony
appearance
in
his
shrunken
cheeks
he
looked
smaller
i
saw
him
lessened
i
thought
of
him
as
he
had
been
so
short
a
time
before
imprisoned
in
his
great
stone
captors
that
had
obsessed
him
there
s
tremendous
power
in
it
an
awful
power
i
stammered
more
to
break
the
oppressive
pause
than
for
any
desire
in
me
to
speak
with
him
it
brings
back
egypt
in
some
extraordinary
way
ancient
egypt
i
mean
brings
it
close
into
the
my
words
ran
on
of
their
own
accord
almost
i
spoke
with
a
hush
unwittingly
there
was
awe
in
me
isley
had
moved
away
towards
the
window
leaving
me
face
to
face
with
this
strange
incarnation
of
another
age
it
must
he
replied
deep
light
still
glowing
in
his
eyes
for
the
soul
of
the
old
days
is
in
it
no
one
i
think
can
hear
it
and
remain
the
same
it
expresses
you
see
the
essential
passion
and
beauty
of
that
gorgeous
worship
that
splendid
faith
that
reasonable
and
intelligent
worship
of
the
sun
the
only
scientific
belief
the
world
has
ever
known
its
popular
form
of
course
was
largely
superstitious
but
the
sacerdotal
form
the
form
used
by
the
priests
that
is
who
understood
the
relationship
between
colour
sound
and
symbol
was
he
broke
off
suddenly
as
though
he
had
been
speaking
to
himself
we
sat
down
george
isley
leaned
out
of
the
window
with
his
back
to
us
watching
the
desert
in
the
moonless
night
you
have
tried
its
effect
before
upon
others
i
asked
upon
myself
he
answered
shortly
upon
others
i
insisted
he
hesitated
an
instant
upon
one
other
yes
he
admitted
intentionally
and
something
quivered
in
me
as
i
asked
it
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
slightly
i
m
merely
a
speculative
archaeologist
he
smiled
and
and
an
imaginative
egyptologist
my
bounden
duty
is
to
reconstruct
the
past
so
that
it
lives
for
an
impulse
rose
in
me
to
take
him
by
the
throat
you
know
perfectly
well
of
course
the
magical
effect
it
s
sure
likely
at
least
to
have
he
stared
steadily
at
me
through
the
cigarette
smoke
to
this
day
i
can
not
think
exactly
what
it
was
in
this
man
that
made
me
shudder
i
m
sure
of
nothing
he
replied
smoothly
but
i
consider
it
quite
legitimate
to
try
magical
the
word
you
used
has
no
meaning
for
me
if
such
a
thing
exists
it
is
merely
scientific
undiscovered
or
forgotten
an
insolent
aggressive
light
shone
in
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
his
manner
was
almost
truculent
you
refer
i
take
it
to
our
friend
rather
than
to
yourself
and
with
difficulty
i
met
his
singular
stare
from
his
whole
person
something
still
emanated
that
was
forbidding
yet
overmasteringly
persuasive
it
brought
back
the
notion
of
that
invisible
web
that
dim
gauze
curtain
that
motionless
influence
lying
waiting
at
the
centre
for
its
prey
those
monstrous
and
mysterious
items
standing
alert
and
watchful
through
the
centuries
you
mean
he
added
lower
his
altered
attitude
to
life
his
going
to
hear
him
use
the
words
the
very
phrase
struck
me
with
sudden
chill
before
i
could
answer
however
and
certainly
before
i
could
master
the
touch
of
horror
that
rushed
over
me
i
heard
him
continuing
in
a
whisper
it
seemed
again
that
he
spoke
to
himself
as
much
as
he
spoke
to
me
the
soul
i
suppose
has
the
right
to
choose
its
own
conditions
and
surroundings
to
pass
elsewhere
involves
translation
not
he
smoked
a
moment
in
silence
then
said
another
curious
thing
looking
up
into
my
face
with
an
expression
of
intense
earnestness
something
genuine
in
him
again
replaced
the
pose
of
cynicism
the
soul
is
eternal
and
can
take
its
place
anywhere
regardless
of
mere
duration
what
is
there
in
the
vulgar
and
superficial
present
that
should
hold
it
so
exclusively
and
where
can
it
find
the
belief
the
faith
the
beauty
that
are
the
very
essence
of
its
life
where
in
the
rush
and
scatter
of
this
tawdry
age
can
it
make
its
home
shall
it
flutter
for
ever
in
a
valley
of
dry
bones
when
a
living
past
lies
ready
and
waiting
with
loveliness
strength
and
glory
he
moved
closer
he
touched
my
arm
i
felt
his
breath
upon
my
face
come
with
us
he
whispered
awfully
come
back
with
us
withdraw
your
life
from
the
rubbish
of
this
futile
ugliness
come
back
and
worship
with
us
in
the
spirit
of
the
past
take
up
the
old
old
splendour
the
glory
the
immense
conceptions
the
wondrous
certainty
the
ineffable
knowledge
of
essentials
it
all
lies
about
you
still
it
s
calling
ever
calling
it
s
very
close
it
draws
you
day
and
night
calling
calling
calling
his
voice
died
off
curiously
into
distance
on
the
word
i
can
hear
it
to
this
day
and
the
soft
droning
quality
in
the
intense
yet
fading
tone
calling
calling
but
his
eyes
turned
wicked
i
felt
the
sinister
power
of
the
man
i
was
aware
of
madness
in
his
thought
and
mind
the
past
he
sought
to
glorify
i
saw
black
as
with
the
forbidding
egyptian
darkness
of
a
plague
it
was
not
beauty
but
death
that
i
heard
calling
calling
calling
it
s
real
he
went
on
hardly
aware
that
i
shrank
and
not
a
dream
these
ruined
symbols
still
remain
in
touch
with
that
which
was
they
are
potent
as
they
were
six
thousand
years
ago
the
amazing
life
of
those
days
brims
behind
them
they
are
not
mere
masses
of
oppressive
stone
they
express
in
visible
form
great
powers
that
still
are
he
lowered
his
head
peered
up
into
my
face
and
whispered
something
secret
passed
into
his
eyes
i
saw
you
change
came
the
words
below
his
breath
as
you
saw
the
change
in
us
but
only
worship
can
produce
that
change
the
soul
assumes
the
qualities
of
the
deity
it
worships
the
powers
of
its
deity
possess
it
and
transform
it
into
its
own
likeness
you
also
felt
it
also
were
possessed
i
saw
the
deity
upon
your
i
seemed
to
shake
myself
as
a
dog
shakes
water
from
its
body
i
stood
up
i
remember
that
i
stretched
my
hands
out
as
though
to
push
him
from
me
and
expel
some
creeping
influence
from
my
mind
i
remember
another
thing
as
well
but
for
the
reality
of
the
sequel
and
but
for
the
result
still
facing
me
in
the
disappearance
of
george
isley
the
loss
to
the
present
time
of
all
george
isley
i
might
have
found
subject
for
laughter
in
what
i
saw
comedy
was
in
it
certainly
yet
it
was
both
ghastly
and
terrific
deep
horror
crept
below
the
aspect
of
the
ludicrous
for
the
apparent
mimicry
cloaked
truth
it
was
appalling
because
it
was
real
in
the
large
mirror
that
reflected
the
room
behind
me
i
saw
myself
and
moleson
i
saw
isley
too
in
the
background
by
the
open
window
and
the
attitude
of
all
three
was
the
attitude
of
hieroglyphics
come
to
life
my
arms
indeed
were
stretched
but
not
stretched
as
i
had
thought
in
mere
they
were
stretched
unnaturally
the
forearms
made
those
strange
obtuse
angles
that
the
old
carved
granite
wears
the
palms
of
the
hands
held
upwards
the
heads
thrown
back
the
legs
advanced
the
bodies
stiffened
into
postures
that
expressed
forgotten
ancient
minds
the
physical
conformation
of
all
three
was
monstrous
and
yet
reverence
and
truth
dictated
even
the
uncouthness
of
the
gestures
something
in
all
three
of
us
inspired
the
forms
our
bodies
had
assumed
our
attitudes
expressed
buried
yearnings
emotions
tendencies
whatever
they
may
be
termed
that
the
spirit
of
the
past
evoked
i
saw
the
reflected
picture
but
for
a
moment
i
dropped
my
arms
aware
of
foolishness
in
my
way
of
standing
moleson
moved
forward
with
his
long
significant
stride
and
at
the
same
instant
isley
came
up
quickly
and
joined
us
from
his
place
by
the
open
window
we
looked
into
each
other
s
faces
without
a
word
there
was
this
little
pause
that
lasted
perhaps
ten
seconds
but
in
that
pause
i
felt
the
entire
world
slide
past
me
i
heard
the
centuries
rush
by
at
headlong
speed
the
present
dipped
away
existence
was
no
longer
in
a
line
that
stretched
two
ways
it
was
a
circle
in
which
ourselves
together
with
past
and
future
stood
motionless
at
the
centre
all
details
equally
accessible
at
once
the
three
of
us
were
falling
falling
backwards
come
said
the
voice
of
moleson
solemnly
but
with
the
sweetness
as
of
a
child
anticipating
joy
come
let
us
go
together
for
the
boat
of
ra
has
crossed
the
underworld
the
darkness
has
been
conquered
let
us
go
out
together
and
find
the
dawn
listen
it
is
calling
calling
calling
xiii
i
was
aware
of
rushing
but
it
was
the
soul
in
me
that
rushed
it
experienced
dizzy
unutterable
alterations
thousands
of
emotions
intense
and
varied
poured
through
me
at
lightning
speed
each
satisfyingly
known
yet
gone
before
its
name
appeared
the
life
of
many
centuries
tore
headlong
back
with
me
and
as
in
drowning
this
epitome
of
existence
shot
in
a
few
seconds
the
steep
slopes
the
past
had
so
laboriously
built
up
the
changes
flashed
and
passed
i
wept
and
prayed
and
worshipped
i
loved
and
suffered
i
battled
lost
and
won
down
the
gigantic
scale
of
ages
that
telescoped
thus
into
a
few
brief
moments
the
soul
in
me
went
sliding
backwards
towards
a
motionless
reposeful
past
i
remember
foolish
details
that
interrupted
the
immense
descent
i
put
on
coat
and
hat
i
remember
some
one
s
words
strangely
sounding
as
when
some
bird
wakes
up
and
sings
at
midnight
we
ll
take
the
little
door
the
front
one
s
locked
by
now
and
i
have
a
vague
recollection
of
the
outline
of
the
great
hotel
with
its
colonnades
and
terraces
fading
behind
me
through
the
air
but
these
details
merely
flickered
and
disappeared
as
though
i
fell
earthwards
from
a
star
and
passed
feathers
or
blown
leaves
upon
the
way
there
was
no
friction
as
my
soul
dropped
backwards
into
time
the
flight
was
easy
and
silent
as
a
dream
i
felt
myself
sucked
down
into
gulfs
whose
emptiness
offered
no
resistance
until
at
last
the
appalling
speed
decreased
of
its
own
accord
and
the
dizzy
flight
became
a
kind
of
gentle
floating
it
changed
imperceptibly
into
a
gliding
motion
as
though
the
angle
altered
my
feet
quite
naturally
were
on
the
ground
moving
through
something
soft
that
clung
to
them
and
rustled
while
it
clung
i
looked
up
and
saw
the
bright
armies
of
the
stars
in
front
of
me
i
recognised
the
shadowy
ridges
on
both
sides
lay
the
open
expanses
of
familiar
wilderness
and
beside
me
one
on
either
hand
moved
two
figures
who
were
my
companions
we
were
in
the
desert
but
it
was
the
desert
of
thousands
of
years
ago
my
companions
moreover
though
familiar
to
some
part
of
me
seemed
strangers
or
half
known
their
names
i
strove
in
vain
to
capture
mosely
ilson
sounded
in
my
head
mingled
together
falsely
and
when
i
stole
a
glance
at
them
i
saw
dark
lines
of
mannikins
unfilled
with
substance
and
was
aware
of
the
grotesque
gestures
of
living
hieroglyphics
it
seemed
for
an
instant
that
their
arms
were
bound
behind
their
backs
impossibly
and
that
their
heads
turned
sharply
across
their
lineal
shoulders
but
for
a
moment
only
for
at
a
second
glance
i
saw
them
solid
and
compact
their
names
came
back
to
me
our
arms
were
linked
together
as
we
walked
we
had
already
covered
a
great
distance
for
my
limbs
were
aching
and
my
breath
was
short
the
air
was
cold
the
silence
absolute
it
seemed
in
this
faint
light
that
the
desert
flowed
beneath
our
feet
rather
than
that
we
advanced
by
taking
steps
cliffs
with
hooded
tops
moved
past
us
boulders
glided
mounds
of
sand
slid
by
and
then
i
heard
a
voice
upon
my
left
that
was
surely
moleson
speaking
towards
enet
our
feet
are
set
he
half
sang
half
murmured
towards
there
in
the
house
of
birth
we
shall
dedicate
our
hearts
and
lives
and
the
language
no
less
than
the
musical
intonation
of
his
voice
enraptured
me
for
i
understood
he
spoke
of
denderah
in
whose
majestic
temple
recent
hands
had
painted
with
deathless
colours
the
symbols
of
our
cosmic
relationships
with
the
zodiacal
signs
and
denderah
was
our
great
seat
of
worship
of
the
goddess
hathor
the
egyptian
aphrodite
bringer
of
love
and
joy
the
horus
was
her
husband
from
whom
in
his
home
at
edfu
we
imbibed
swift
kinds
of
power
and
it
was
the
time
of
the
new
year
the
great
feast
when
the
forces
of
the
living
earth
turn
upwards
into
happy
growth
we
were
on
foot
across
the
desert
towards
denderah
and
this
sand
we
trod
was
the
sand
of
thousands
of
years
ago
the
paralysis
of
time
and
distance
involved
some
amazing
lightness
of
the
spirit
that
i
suppose
touched
ecstasy
there
was
intoxication
in
the
soul
i
was
not
divided
from
the
stars
nor
separate
from
this
desert
that
rushed
with
us
the
unhampered
wind
blew
freshly
from
my
nerves
and
skin
and
the
nile
glimmering
faintly
on
our
right
lay
with
its
lapping
waves
in
both
my
hands
i
knew
the
life
of
egypt
for
it
was
in
me
over
me
round
me
i
was
a
part
of
it
we
went
happily
like
birds
to
meet
the
sunrise
there
were
no
pits
of
measured
time
and
interval
that
could
detain
us
we
flowed
yet
were
at
rest
we
were
endlessly
alive
present
and
future
alike
were
inconceivable
we
were
in
the
kingdom
of
the
past
the
pyramids
were
just
and
the
army
of
obelisks
looked
about
them
proud
of
their
first
balance
thebes
swung
her
hundred
gates
upon
the
world
new
shining
memphis
glittered
with
myriad
reflections
into
waters
that
the
tears
of
isis
sweetened
and
the
cliffs
of
abou
simbel
were
still
innocent
of
their
gigantic
progeny
alone
the
sphinx
linking
timelessness
with
time
brooded
unguessed
and
underived
upon
an
alien
world
we
marched
within
antiquity
towards
denderah
how
long
we
marched
how
fast
how
far
we
went
i
can
remember
as
little
as
the
marvellous
speech
that
passed
across
me
while
my
two
companions
spoke
together
i
only
remember
that
suddenly
a
wave
of
pain
disturbed
my
wondrous
happiness
and
caused
my
calm
which
had
seemed
beyond
all
reach
of
break
to
fall
away
i
heard
their
voices
abruptly
with
a
kind
of
terror
a
sensation
of
fear
of
loss
of
nightmare
bewilderment
came
over
me
like
cold
wind
what
lived
naturally
true
to
their
inmost
hearts
lived
merely
by
means
of
a
temperamental
sympathy
and
the
stage
had
come
at
which
my
powers
failed
exhaustion
overtook
me
i
wilted
the
strain
the
abnormal
backwards
stretch
of
consciousness
that
was
put
upon
me
by
another
gave
way
and
broke
i
heard
their
voices
faint
and
horrible
my
joy
was
extinguished
a
glare
of
horror
fell
upon
the
desert
and
the
stars
seemed
evil
an
anguishing
desire
for
the
safe
and
wholesome
present
usurped
all
this
mad
yearning
to
obtain
the
past
my
feet
fell
out
of
step
the
rushing
of
the
desert
paused
i
unlinked
my
arms
we
stopped
all
three
the
actual
spot
is
to
this
day
well
known
to
me
i
found
it
afterwards
i
even
photographed
it
it
lies
actually
not
far
from
helouan
a
few
miles
at
most
beyond
the
solitary
palm
where
slopes
of
undulating
sand
mark
the
opening
of
a
strange
enticing
valley
called
the
wadi
gerraui
and
it
is
enticing
because
it
beckons
and
leads
on
here
amid
torn
gorges
of
a
limestone
wilderness
there
is
suddenly
soft
yellow
sand
that
flows
and
draws
the
feet
onward
it
slips
away
with
one
too
easily
always
the
next
ridge
and
basin
must
be
seen
each
time
a
little
farther
it
has
the
quality
of
decoying
the
cliffs
say
no
but
this
streaming
sand
invites
in
its
flowing
curves
of
gold
there
is
enchantment
and
it
was
here
upon
its
very
lips
we
stopped
the
rhythm
of
our
steps
broken
our
hearts
no
longer
one
my
temporary
rapture
vanished
i
was
aware
of
fear
for
the
present
rushed
upon
me
with
attack
in
it
and
i
felt
that
my
mind
was
arrested
close
upon
the
edge
of
madness
something
cleared
and
lifted
in
my
brain
the
soul
indeed
could
choose
its
but
to
live
elsewhere
completely
was
the
choice
of
madness
and
to
live
divorced
from
all
the
sweet
wholesome
business
of
involved
an
exile
that
was
worse
than
madness
it
was
death
my
heart
burned
for
george
isley
i
remembered
the
tear
upon
his
cheek
the
agony
of
his
struggle
i
shared
suddenly
with
him
yet
with
him
was
the
reality
with
me
a
sympathetic
reflection
merely
was
already
too
far
gone
to
fight
i
shall
never
forget
the
desolation
of
that
strange
scene
beneath
the
morning
stars
the
desert
lay
down
and
watched
us
we
stood
upon
the
brink
of
a
little
broken
ridge
looking
into
the
valley
of
golden
sand
this
sand
gleamed
soft
and
wonderful
in
the
starlight
some
twenty
feet
below
the
descent
was
easy
but
i
would
not
move
i
refused
to
advance
another
step
i
saw
my
companions
in
the
mysterious
beside
me
peering
over
the
edge
moleson
in
front
a
little
and
i
turned
to
him
sure
of
the
part
i
meant
to
play
yet
conscious
painfully
of
my
helplessness
my
personality
seemed
a
straw
in
that
spun
in
a
futile
effort
to
arrest
the
flood
that
bore
it
there
was
vivid
human
conflict
in
the
moment
s
silence
it
was
an
eddy
that
paused
in
the
great
body
of
the
tide
and
then
i
spoke
oh
i
was
ashamed
of
the
insignificance
of
my
voice
and
the
weakness
of
my
little
personality
moleson
we
go
no
farther
with
you
we
have
already
come
too
far
we
now
turn
behind
my
words
were
a
paltry
thirty
years
his
answer
drove
sixty
centuries
against
me
for
his
voice
was
like
the
wind
that
passed
whispering
down
the
stream
of
yellow
sand
below
us
he
smiled
our
feet
are
set
towards
there
is
no
turning
back
listen
it
is
calling
calling
calling
we
will
go
home
i
cried
in
a
tone
i
vainly
strove
to
make
imperative
our
home
is
there
he
sang
pointing
with
one
long
thin
arm
towards
the
brightening
east
for
the
temple
calls
us
and
the
river
takes
our
feet
we
shall
be
in
the
house
of
birth
to
meet
the
sunrise
you
lie
i
cried
again
you
speak
the
lies
of
madness
and
this
past
you
seek
is
the
house
of
death
it
is
the
kingdom
of
the
the
words
tore
wildly
impotently
out
of
me
i
seized
george
isley
s
arm
come
back
with
me
i
pleaded
vehemently
my
heart
aching
with
a
nameless
pain
for
him
we
ll
retrace
our
steps
come
home
with
me
come
back
listen
the
present
calls
you
sweetly
his
arm
slipped
horribly
out
of
my
grasp
that
had
seemed
to
hold
it
so
tightly
moleson
already
below
us
in
the
yellow
sand
looked
small
with
distance
he
was
gliding
rapidly
farther
with
uncanny
swiftness
the
diminution
of
his
form
was
ghastly
it
was
like
a
doll
s
and
his
voice
rose
up
faint
as
with
the
distance
of
great
gulfs
of
space
calling
calling
you
hear
it
for
ever
calling
it
died
away
with
the
wind
along
that
sandy
valley
and
the
past
swept
in
a
flood
across
the
brightening
sky
i
swayed
as
though
a
storm
was
at
my
back
i
reeled
almost
i
went
too
over
the
crumbling
edge
into
the
sand
come
back
with
me
come
home
i
cried
more
faintly
the
present
alone
is
real
there
is
work
ambition
duty
there
is
beauty
too
the
beauty
of
good
living
and
there
is
love
there
is
a
woman
calling
calling
that
other
voice
took
up
the
word
below
me
i
heard
the
faint
refrain
sing
down
the
sandy
walls
the
wild
sweet
pang
in
it
was
marvellous
our
feet
are
set
for
it
is
calling
calling
my
voice
fell
into
nothingness
george
isley
was
below
me
now
his
outline
tiny
against
the
sheet
of
yellow
sand
and
the
sand
was
moving
the
desert
rushed
again
the
human
figures
receded
swiftly
into
the
past
they
had
reconstructed
with
the
creative
yearning
of
their
souls
i
stood
alone
upon
the
edge
of
crumbling
limestone
helplessly
watching
them
it
was
amazing
what
i
witnessed
while
the
shafts
of
crimson
dawn
rose
up
the
sky
the
enormous
desert
turned
alive
to
the
horizon
with
gold
and
blue
and
silver
the
purple
shadows
melted
into
grey
the
ridges
shone
huge
messengers
of
light
flashed
everywhere
at
once
the
radiance
of
sunrise
dazzled
my
outer
sight
but
if
my
eyes
were
blinded
my
inner
sight
was
focused
the
more
clearly
upon
what
followed
i
witnessed
the
disappearance
of
george
isley
there
was
a
dreadful
magic
in
the
picture
the
pair
of
them
small
and
distant
below
me
in
that
little
sandy
hollow
stood
out
sharply
defined
as
in
a
miniature
i
saw
their
outlines
neat
and
terrible
like
some
ghastly
inset
against
the
enormous
scenery
though
so
close
to
me
in
actual
space
they
were
centuries
away
in
time
and
a
dim
vast
shadow
was
about
them
that
was
not
mere
shadow
of
the
ridges
it
encompassed
them
it
moved
crawling
over
the
sand
obliterating
them
within
it
like
insects
lost
in
amber
they
became
visibly
imprisoned
dwindled
in
size
borne
deep
away
absorbed
and
then
i
recognised
the
outline
once
more
but
this
time
recumbent
and
spread
flat
upon
the
desert
s
face
i
knew
the
monstrous
shapes
of
the
twin
obsessing
symbols
the
spirit
of
ancient
egypt
lay
over
all
the
land
tremendous
in
the
dawn
the
sunrise
summoned
her
she
lay
prostrate
before
the
deity
the
shadows
of
the
towering
colossi
lay
prostrate
too
the
little
humans
with
their
worshipping
and
conquered
hearts
lay
deep
within
them
george
isley
i
saw
clearest
the
distinctness
the
reality
were
appalling
he
was
naked
robbed
undressed
i
saw
him
a
skeleton
picked
clean
to
the
very
bones
as
by
an
acid
his
life
lay
hid
in
the
being
of
that
mighty
past
egypt
had
absorbed
him
he
was
gone
i
closed
my
eyes
but
i
could
not
keep
them
closed
they
opened
of
their
own
accord
the
three
of
us
were
nearing
the
great
hotel
that
rose
yellow
with
shuttered
windows
in
the
early
sunshine
a
wind
blew
briskly
from
the
north
across
the
mokattam
hills
there
were
soft
clouds
dotted
about
the
sky
and
across
the
nile
where
the
mist
lay
in
a
line
of
white
i
saw
the
tops
of
the
pyramids
gleaming
like
mountain
peaks
of
gold
a
string
of
camels
laden
with
white
stone
went
past
us
i
heard
the
crying
of
the
natives
in
the
streets
of
helouan
and
as
we
went
up
the
steps
the
donkeys
arrived
and
camped
in
the
sandy
road
beside
their
till
the
tourists
claimed
them
good
morning
cried
abdullah
the
man
who
owned
them
you
all
go
sakkhâra
or
memphis
beat
ful
day
and
vair
good
donkeys
moleson
went
up
to
his
room
without
a
word
and
isley
did
the
same
i
thought
he
staggered
a
moment
as
he
turned
the
passage
corner
from
my
sight
his
face
wore
a
look
of
vacancy
that
some
call
peace
there
was
radiance
in
it
it
made
me
shudder
aching
in
mind
and
body
and
no
word
spoken
i
followed
their
example
i
went
upstairs
to
bed
and
slept
a
dreamless
sleep
till
after
sunset
xiv
and
i
woke
with
a
lost
unhappy
feeling
that
a
withdrawing
tide
had
left
me
on
the
shore
alone
and
desolate
my
first
instinct
was
for
my
friend
george
isley
and
i
noticed
a
square
white
envelope
with
my
name
upon
it
in
his
writing
before
i
opened
it
i
knew
quite
well
what
words
would
be
inside
we
are
going
up
to
thebes
the
note
informed
me
simply
we
leave
by
the
night
train
if
you
care
to
but
the
last
four
words
were
scratched
out
again
though
not
so
thickly
that
i
could
not
read
them
then
came
the
address
of
the
egyptologist
s
house
and
the
signature
very
firmly
traced
yours
ever
george
i
glanced
at
my
watch
and
saw
that
it
was
after
seven
o
clock
the
night
train
left
at
six
they
had
already
started
the
pain
of
feeling
forsaken
left
behind
was
deep
and
bitter
for
myself
but
what
i
felt
for
him
old
friend
and
comrade
was
even
more
intense
since
it
was
hopeless
fear
and
conventional
emotion
had
stopped
me
at
the
very
gates
of
an
amazing
possibility
some
state
of
consciousness
that
the
past
might
doff
the
present
and
by
slipping
out
of
time
experience
eternity
that
was
the
seduction
i
had
escaped
by
the
uninspired
resistance
of
my
pettier
soul
yet
he
my
friend
yielding
in
order
to
conquer
had
obtained
an
awful
prize
ah
i
understood
the
picture
s
other
side
as
well
with
an
unutterable
poignancy
of
pity
the
prize
of
immobility
which
is
sheer
stagnation
the
imagined
bliss
which
is
a
false
escape
the
dream
of
finding
beauty
away
from
present
things
from
that
dream
the
awakening
must
be
rude
indeed
clutching
at
vanished
stars
he
had
clutched
the
oldest
illusion
in
the
world
to
me
it
seemed
the
negation
of
life
that
had
betrayed
him
the
pity
of
it
burned
me
like
a
flame
but
i
did
not
care
to
follow
him
and
his
companion
i
waited
at
helouan
for
his
return
filling
the
empty
days
with
yet
emptier
explanations
i
felt
as
a
man
who
sees
what
he
loves
sinking
down
into
clear
deep
water
still
within
visible
reach
yet
gone
beyond
recovery
moleson
had
taken
him
back
to
thebes
and
egypt
monstrous
effigy
of
the
past
had
caught
her
prey
the
rest
moreover
is
easily
told
moleson
i
never
saw
again
to
this
day
i
have
never
seen
him
though
his
subsequent
books
are
known
to
me
with
the
banal
fact
that
he
is
numbered
with
those
energetic
and
deluded
enthusiasts
who
start
a
new
religion
obtain
notoriety
a
few
hysterical
followers
and
oblivion
george
isley
however
returned
to
helouan
after
a
fortnight
s
absence
i
saw
him
knew
him
talked
and
had
my
meals
with
him
we
even
did
slight
expeditions
together
he
was
gentle
and
delightful
as
a
woman
who
has
loved
a
wonderful
ideal
and
attained
to
it
in
memory
all
roughness
was
gone
out
of
him
he
was
smooth
and
polished
as
a
crystal
surface
that
reflects
whatever
is
near
enough
to
ask
a
picture
yet
his
appearance
shocked
me
inexpressibly
there
was
nothing
in
him
it
was
the
representation
of
george
isley
that
came
back
from
thebes
the
outer
simulacra
the
shell
that
walks
the
london
streets
i
met
no
vestige
of
the
man
i
used
to
know
george
isley
had
disappeared
with
this
marvellous
automaton
i
lived
another
month
the
horror
of
him
kept
me
company
in
the
hotel
where
he
moved
among
the
cosmopolitan
humanity
as
a
ghost
that
visits
the
sunlight
yet
has
its
home
elsewhere
this
empty
image
of
george
isley
lived
with
me
in
our
helouan
hotel
until
the
winds
of
early
march
informed
his
physical
frame
that
discomfort
was
in
the
air
and
that
he
might
as
well
move
elsewhere
elsewhere
happening
to
be
northwards
and
he
left
just
as
he
stayed
automatically
his
brain
obeyed
the
conventional
stimuli
to
which
his
nerves
and
consequently
his
muscles
were
accustomed
it
sounds
so
foolish
but
he
took
his
ticket
automatically
he
gave
the
natural
and
adequate
reasons
automatically
he
chose
his
ship
and
in
the
same
way
that
ordinary
people
chose
these
things
he
said
like
any
other
man
who
leaves
casual
acquaintances
and
hopes
to
meet
them
again
he
lived
that
is
to
say
entirely
in
his
brain
his
heart
his
emotions
his
temperament
and
personality
that
nameless
for
which
the
great
sympathetic
nervous
system
is
accountable
all
this
his
soul
had
gone
elsewhere
this
once
vigorous
gifted
being
had
become
a
normal
comfortable
man
that
everybody
could
understand
a
commonplace
nonentity
he
was
precisely
what
the
majority
expected
him
to
be
ordinary
a
good
fellow
a
man
of
the
world
he
was
he
merely
reflected
daily
life
without
partaking
of
it
to
the
majority
it
was
hardly
noticeable
very
pleasant
was
a
general
verdict
his
ambition
his
restlessness
his
zeal
had
gone
that
tireless
zest
whose
driving
power
is
yearning
had
taken
flight
leaving
behind
it
physical
energy
without
spiritual
desire
his
soul
had
found
its
nest
and
flown
to
it
he
lived
in
the
chimera
of
the
past
serene
indifferent
detached
i
saw
him
immense
a
shadowy
majestic
figure
standing
ah
not
moving
in
a
repose
that
was
satisfying
because
it
not
change
the
size
the
mystery
the
immobility
that
caged
him
in
seemed
to
me
terrible
for
i
dared
not
intrude
upon
his
awful
privacy
and
intimacy
between
us
there
was
none
of
his
experiences
at
thebes
i
asked
no
single
question
it
was
somehow
not
possible
or
legitimate
he
equally
vouchsafed
no
word
of
explanation
it
was
uncommunicable
to
a
dweller
in
the
present
between
us
was
this
barrier
we
both
respected
he
peered
at
modern
life
incurious
listless
apathetic
through
a
dim
gauze
curtain
he
was
behind
it
people
round
us
were
going
to
sakkhâra
and
the
pyramids
to
see
the
sphinx
by
moonlight
to
dream
at
edfu
and
at
denderah
others
described
their
journeys
to
assouan
khartoum
and
abou
simbel
and
gave
details
of
their
encampments
in
the
desert
wind
wind
wind
the
winds
of
egypt
blew
and
sang
and
sighed
from
the
white
nile
came
the
travellers
and
from
the
blue
nile
from
the
fayum
and
from
nameless
excavations
without
end
they
talked
and
wrote
their
books
they
had
the
magpie
knowledge
of
the
present
the
egyptologists
big
and
little
read
the
writing
on
the
wall
and
put
the
hieroglyphs
and
papyri
into
modern
language
alone
george
isley
the
secret
he
lived
it
and
the
high
passionate
calm
the
lofty
beauty
the
glamour
and
enchantment
that
are
the
spell
of
this
land
were
in
soul
as
well
sufficiently
for
me
to
interpret
his
condition
i
could
not
leave
yet
having
left
i
could
not
stay
away
i
yearned
for
the
egypt
that
he
knew
no
word
i
uttered
speech
could
not
approach
it
we
wandered
by
the
nile
together
and
through
the
groves
of
palms
that
once
were
memphis
the
sandy
wastes
beyond
the
pyramids
knew
our
footsteps
the
mokattam
ridges
purple
at
evening
and
golden
in
the
dawn
held
our
passing
shadows
as
we
silently
went
by
at
no
single
dawn
or
sunset
was
he
to
be
found
indoors
and
it
became
my
habit
to
accompany
him
the
joy
of
worship
in
his
soul
was
marvellous
the
great
still
skies
of
egypt
watched
us
the
hanging
stars
the
gigantic
dome
of
blue
we
felt
together
that
burning
southern
wind
the
golden
sweetness
of
the
sun
lay
in
our
blood
as
we
saw
the
great
boats
take
the
northern
breeze
upstream
immensity
was
everywhere
and
this
golden
magic
of
the
sun
but
it
was
in
the
desert
especially
where
only
sun
and
wind
observe
the
faint
signalling
of
time
where
space
is
nothing
because
it
is
not
divided
and
where
no
detail
reminds
the
heart
that
the
world
is
called
it
was
in
the
desert
this
curtain
hung
most
visibly
between
us
he
on
that
side
i
on
this
it
was
transparent
he
was
with
a
multitude
no
man
can
number
towering
to
the
moon
yet
spreading
backwards
towards
his
burning
source
of
life
drawn
out
by
the
sun
and
by
the
crystal
air
into
some
vast
interior
magnitude
the
spirit
of
george
isley
hung
beside
me
close
yet
far
away
in
the
haze
of
olden
days
and
sometimes
he
moved
i
was
aware
of
gestures
his
head
was
raised
to
listen
one
arm
swung
shadowy
across
the
sea
of
broken
ridges
from
leagues
away
a
line
of
sand
rose
slowly
there
was
a
rustling
another
an
enormous
arm
emerged
to
meet
his
own
and
two
stupendous
figures
drew
together
poised
above
time
yet
throned
upon
the
centuries
they
knew
eternity
so
easily
they
remained
possessors
of
the
land
facing
the
east
they
waited
for
the
dawn
and
their
marvellously
forgotten
singing
poured
across
the
world
wayfarers
i
missed
the
train
at
evian
and
after
infinite
trouble
discovered
a
motor
that
would
take
me
and
all
to
geneva
by
hurrying
the
connection
might
be
just
possible
i
telegraphed
to
haddon
to
meet
me
at
the
station
and
lay
back
comfortably
dreaming
of
the
precipices
of
haute
savoie
we
made
good
time
the
roads
were
excellent
traffic
of
the
slightest
when
crash
there
was
an
instant
s
excruciating
pain
the
sun
went
out
like
a
snuffed
candle
and
i
fell
into
something
as
soft
as
a
bed
of
flowers
and
as
yielding
to
my
weight
as
warm
water
it
was
warm
there
was
a
perfume
of
flowers
my
eyes
opened
focused
vividly
upon
a
detailed
picture
for
a
moment
then
closed
again
there
was
no
context
at
least
none
that
i
could
recall
for
the
scene
though
familiar
as
home
brought
nothing
that
i
definitely
remembered
broken
away
from
any
sequence
unattached
to
any
past
unaware
even
of
my
own
identity
i
simply
saw
this
picture
as
a
camera
snaps
it
off
from
the
world
a
scene
apart
with
meaning
only
for
those
who
knew
the
context
the
warm
soft
thing
i
lay
in
was
a
bed
big
deep
comfortable
and
the
perfume
came
from
flowers
that
stood
beside
it
on
a
little
table
it
was
in
a
stately
ancient
chamber
with
lofty
ceiling
and
immense
open
fireplace
of
stone
pictures
familiar
portraits
and
engravings
i
knew
intimately
hung
upon
the
walls
the
floor
was
bare
with
dignified
carved
furniture
of
oak
and
mahogany
huge
chairs
and
massive
cupboards
and
there
were
latticed
windows
set
within
deep
embrasures
of
grey
stone
where
clambering
roses
patterned
the
sunshine
that
cast
their
moving
shadows
on
the
polished
boards
with
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
there
mingled
too
that
delicate
elusive
odour
of
age
of
wood
of
musty
tapestries
in
spacious
halls
and
corridors
and
of
chambers
long
unopened
to
the
sun
and
air
by
the
door
that
stood
ajar
far
away
at
the
end
of
the
room
very
far
away
it
seemed
an
old
lady
wearing
a
little
cap
of
silk
embroidery
was
whispering
to
a
man
of
stern
uncompromising
figure
who
as
he
listened
bent
down
to
her
with
a
grave
and
even
solemn
face
a
wide
stone
corridor
was
just
visible
through
the
crack
of
the
open
door
behind
her
the
picture
flashed
and
vanished
the
numerous
details
i
took
in
because
they
were
well
known
to
me
already
that
i
could
not
supply
the
context
was
merely
a
trick
of
the
mind
the
kind
of
trick
that
dreams
play
darkness
swamped
vision
again
i
sank
back
into
the
warm
soft
comfortable
bed
of
delicious
oblivion
there
was
not
the
slightest
desire
to
know
sleep
and
soft
forgetfulness
were
all
i
craved
but
a
little
later
or
was
it
a
very
great
deal
later
when
i
opened
my
eyes
again
there
was
a
thin
trail
of
memory
i
remembered
my
name
and
age
i
remembered
vaguely
as
though
from
some
unpleasant
dream
that
i
was
on
the
way
to
meet
a
climbing
friend
in
the
alps
of
haute
savoie
and
that
there
was
need
to
hurry
and
be
very
active
something
had
gone
wrong
it
seemed
there
had
been
a
stupid
violent
disaster
pain
in
it
somewhere
an
accident
where
were
my
belongings
where
for
instance
was
my
precious
tried
old
instrument
on
which
my
life
and
safety
depended
a
rush
of
jumbled
questions
poured
across
my
mind
the
effort
to
sort
them
hurt
atrociously
a
figure
stood
beside
my
bed
it
was
the
same
old
lady
i
had
seen
a
moment
ago
or
was
it
a
month
ago
even
last
year
perhaps
and
this
time
she
was
alone
yet
though
familiar
to
me
as
my
own
right
hand
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
attract
her
name
searching
for
it
brought
the
pain
again
instead
i
asked
an
easier
question
it
seemed
the
most
important
somehow
though
a
feeling
of
shame
came
with
it
as
though
i
knew
i
was
talking
nonsense
my
is
it
safe
it
should
have
stood
any
ordinary
strain
it
s
ash
my
voice
failed
absurdly
caught
away
by
a
whisper
down
my
throat
what
i
talking
about
there
was
vile
confusion
somewhere
she
smiled
tenderly
sweetly
as
she
placed
her
small
cool
hand
upon
my
forehead
her
touch
calmed
me
as
it
always
did
and
the
pain
retreated
a
little
all
your
things
are
safe
she
answered
in
a
voice
so
soft
beneath
the
distant
ceiling
it
was
like
a
bird
s
note
singing
in
the
sky
and
are
also
safe
there
is
no
danger
now
the
bullet
has
been
taken
out
and
all
is
going
well
only
you
must
be
patient
and
lie
very
still
and
and
then
she
added
the
morsel
of
delicious
comfort
she
knew
quite
well
i
waited
for
marion
is
near
you
all
day
long
and
most
of
the
night
besides
she
rarely
leaves
you
she
is
in
and
out
all
i
stared
thirsting
for
more
memory
put
certain
pieces
in
their
place
again
i
heard
them
click
together
as
they
joined
but
they
only
tried
to
join
there
were
several
pieces
missing
they
must
have
been
lost
in
the
disaster
the
pattern
was
too
ridiculous
i
ought
to
tel
telegraph
i
began
seizing
at
a
fragment
that
poked
its
end
up
then
plunged
out
of
sight
again
before
i
could
read
more
of
it
the
pieces
fell
apart
they
would
not
hold
together
without
these
missing
fragments
anger
flamed
up
in
me
they
re
badly
made
i
said
with
a
petulance
i
was
secretly
ashamed
of
you
have
chosen
the
wrong
pieces
i
m
not
a
child
to
be
treated
a
shock
of
heat
tore
through
me
led
by
a
point
of
iron
with
blasting
pain
sleep
my
poor
dear
félix
sleep
she
murmured
soothingly
while
her
tiny
hand
stroked
my
forehead
just
in
time
to
prevent
that
pointed
hot
thing
entering
my
heart
sleep
again
now
and
a
little
later
you
shall
tell
me
their
names
and
i
will
send
on
horseback
quickly
telegraph
i
tried
to
say
but
the
word
went
lost
before
i
could
pronounce
it
it
was
a
nonsense
word
caught
up
from
dreams
thought
fluttered
and
went
out
i
will
send
she
whispered
in
the
quickest
possible
way
you
shall
explain
to
marion
sleep
first
a
little
longer
promise
me
to
lie
quite
still
and
sleep
when
you
wake
again
she
will
come
to
you
at
she
sat
down
gently
on
the
edge
of
the
enormous
bed
so
that
i
saw
her
outline
against
the
window
where
the
roses
clambered
to
come
in
she
bent
over
me
or
was
it
a
rose
that
bent
in
the
wind
across
the
stone
embrasure
i
saw
her
clear
blue
eyes
or
was
it
two
raindrops
upon
a
withered
that
mirrored
the
summer
sky
thank
you
my
voice
murmured
with
intense
relief
as
everything
sank
away
and
the
garden
seemed
to
enter
by
the
latticed
windows
for
there
was
a
power
in
her
way
that
made
obedience
sweet
and
her
little
hand
besides
cushioned
the
attack
of
that
cruel
iron
point
so
that
i
hardly
felt
its
entrance
before
the
fierce
heat
could
reach
me
darkness
again
put
out
the
world
then
after
a
prodigious
interval
my
eyes
once
more
opened
to
the
stately
chamber
that
i
knew
so
well
and
this
time
i
found
myself
alone
in
my
brain
was
a
stinging
splitting
sensation
as
though
memory
shook
her
pieces
together
with
angry
violence
pieces
moreover
made
of
clashing
metal
a
degrading
nausea
almost
vanquished
me
against
my
feet
was
a
heated
metal
body
too
heavy
for
me
to
move
and
bandages
were
tight
round
my
neck
and
the
back
of
my
head
dimly
it
came
back
to
me
that
hands
had
been
about
me
hours
ago
soft
ministering
hands
that
i
loved
their
perfume
lingered
still
faces
and
names
fled
in
swift
procession
past
me
yet
without
my
making
any
attempt
to
bid
them
stay
i
asked
myself
no
questions
effort
of
any
sort
was
utterly
beyond
me
i
lay
and
watched
and
waited
helpless
and
strangely
weak
one
or
two
things
alone
were
clear
they
came
too
without
the
effort
to
think
them
there
had
been
a
disaster
they
had
carried
me
into
the
nearest
house
and
the
mountain
heights
so
keenly
longed
for
were
suddenly
denied
me
i
was
being
cared
for
by
kind
people
somewhere
far
from
the
world
s
high
routes
they
were
familiar
people
yet
for
the
moment
i
had
lost
the
name
but
it
was
the
bitterness
of
losing
my
holiday
climbing
that
chiefly
savaged
me
so
that
strong
desire
returned
upon
itself
unfulfilled
and
knowing
the
danger
of
frustrated
yearnings
and
the
curious
states
of
mind
they
may
engender
my
tumbling
brain
registered
a
decision
automatically
keep
careful
watch
upon
yourself
it
whispered
for
i
saw
the
peaks
that
towered
above
the
world
and
felt
the
wind
rise
from
the
hidden
valleys
the
perfume
of
lonely
ridges
came
to
me
and
i
saw
the
snow
against
the
sky
yet
i
could
not
reach
them
i
lay
instead
broken
and
useless
upon
my
back
in
a
soft
deep
comfortable
bed
and
i
loathed
the
thought
a
dull
and
evil
fury
rose
within
me
where
was
haddon
he
would
get
me
out
of
it
if
any
one
could
and
where
was
my
dear
old
trusted
above
all
who
were
these
gentle
people
who
cared
for
me
and
with
this
last
thought
came
some
fairy
touch
of
sweetness
so
delicious
that
i
was
conscious
of
sudden
resignation
more
even
of
delight
and
joy
this
joy
and
anger
ran
races
for
possession
of
my
mind
and
i
knew
not
which
to
follow
both
seemed
real
and
both
seemed
true
the
cruel
confusion
was
an
added
torture
two
sets
of
places
and
people
seemed
to
mingle
keep
a
careful
watch
upon
yourself
repeated
the
automatic
caution
then
with
returning
blissful
darkness
came
another
thing
a
tiny
point
of
wonder
where
light
entered
in
i
thought
of
a
woman
it
was
a
vehement
commanding
thought
and
though
at
first
it
was
very
close
and
real
as
much
of
as
haddon
and
my
precious
the
next
second
it
was
leagues
away
in
another
world
somewhere
yet
before
the
confusion
twisted
it
all
askew
i
knew
her
i
remembered
clearly
even
where
she
lived
that
i
knew
her
husband
too
had
stayed
with
them
in
in
scotland
yes
in
scotland
yet
no
word
in
this
life
had
ever
crossed
my
lips
for
she
was
not
free
to
come
neither
of
us
with
eyes
or
lips
or
gesture
had
ever
betrayed
a
hint
to
the
other
of
our
deeply
hidden
secret
and
although
for
me
she
was
woman
my
great
yearning
long
long
ago
it
was
in
early
youth
had
been
sternly
put
aside
and
buried
with
all
the
vigour
nature
gave
me
her
husband
was
my
friend
as
well
only
now
the
shock
had
somehow
strained
the
prison
bars
and
the
yearning
escaped
for
a
moment
and
vehement
with
passion
long
denied
the
inhibition
was
destroyed
the
knowledge
swept
deliciously
upon
me
that
we
had
the
right
to
be
together
because
we
always
together
i
had
the
right
to
ask
for
her
my
mind
was
certainly
a
mere
field
of
confused
ungoverned
images
no
thinking
was
possible
for
it
hurt
too
vilely
but
this
one
memory
stood
out
with
violence
i
distinctly
remember
that
i
called
to
her
to
come
and
that
she
had
the
right
to
come
because
my
need
was
so
peremptory
to
the
one
most
loved
of
all
this
life
had
brought
me
yet
to
whom
i
had
never
spoken
because
she
was
in
another
s
keeping
i
called
for
help
and
called
i
verily
believe
aloud
please
come
then
close
upon
its
heels
the
automatic
warning
again
keep
close
watch
upon
yourself
it
was
as
though
one
great
yearning
had
loosed
the
other
that
was
even
greater
and
had
set
it
free
disappearing
consciousness
then
followed
the
cry
for
an
incalculable
distance
down
into
subterraneans
within
myself
that
were
positively
frightening
it
plunged
away
but
the
cry
was
real
the
yearning
appeal
held
authority
in
it
as
of
command
love
gave
the
right
supplied
the
power
as
well
for
it
seemed
to
me
a
tiny
answer
came
but
from
so
far
away
that
it
was
scarcely
audible
and
names
were
nowhere
in
it
either
in
answer
or
appeal
i
am
always
here
i
have
never
never
left
you
the
unconsciousness
that
followed
was
not
complete
apparently
there
was
a
memory
of
effort
in
it
of
struggle
and
as
it
were
of
searching
some
one
was
trying
to
get
at
me
i
tossed
in
a
troubled
sea
upon
a
piece
of
wreckage
that
another
swimmer
also
fought
to
reach
huge
waves
of
transparent
green
now
brought
this
figure
nearer
now
concealed
it
but
it
came
steadily
on
holding
out
a
rope
my
exhaustion
was
too
great
for
me
to
respond
yet
this
swimmer
swept
up
nearer
brought
by
enormous
rollers
that
threatened
to
engulf
us
both
the
rope
was
for
my
safety
too
i
saw
hands
outstretched
in
the
deep
water
i
saw
the
outline
of
the
body
and
once
i
even
saw
the
face
but
for
a
second
merely
the
wave
that
bore
it
crashed
with
a
horrible
roar
that
smothered
us
both
and
swept
me
from
my
piece
of
wreckage
in
the
violent
flood
of
water
the
rope
whipped
against
my
feeble
hands
i
grasped
it
a
sense
of
divine
security
at
once
came
over
me
an
intolerable
sweetness
of
utter
bliss
and
comfort
then
blackness
and
suffocation
as
of
the
grave
the
point
of
iron
struck
me
it
beat
audibly
against
my
heart
i
heard
the
knocking
the
pain
brought
me
up
to
the
surface
and
the
knocking
of
my
dreams
was
in
reality
a
knocking
on
the
door
some
one
was
gently
tapping
such
was
the
confusion
of
images
in
my
mind
that
i
expected
to
see
the
old
lady
enter
bringing
ropes
and
and
followed
by
haddon
my
mountaineering
friend
for
i
thought
that
i
had
fallen
down
a
deep
crevasse
and
had
waited
hours
for
help
in
the
cold
blue
darkness
of
the
ice
i
was
too
weak
to
answer
and
the
knocking
for
that
matter
was
not
repeated
i
did
not
even
hear
the
opening
of
the
door
so
softly
did
she
move
into
the
room
i
only
knew
that
before
i
actually
saw
her
this
wave
of
intolerable
sweetness
drenched
me
once
again
with
bliss
and
peace
and
comfort
my
pain
retreated
and
i
closed
my
eyes
knowing
i
should
feel
that
cool
and
soothing
hand
upon
my
forehead
the
same
minute
i
did
feel
it
there
was
a
perfume
of
old
gardens
in
the
air
i
opened
my
eyes
to
look
the
gratitude
i
could
not
utter
and
saw
close
against
me
not
the
old
lady
but
the
young
and
lovely
face
my
worship
had
long
made
familiar
with
lips
that
smiled
their
yearning
and
eyes
of
brown
that
held
tears
of
sympathy
she
sat
down
beside
me
on
the
bed
the
warmth
and
fragrance
of
her
atmosphere
enveloped
me
i
sank
away
into
a
garden
where
spring
melts
magically
into
summer
her
arms
were
round
my
neck
her
face
dropped
down
so
that
i
felt
her
hair
upon
my
cheek
and
eyes
and
then
whispering
my
name
twice
over
she
kissed
me
on
the
lips
marion
i
murmured
hush
mother
sends
you
this
she
answered
softly
you
are
to
take
it
all
she
made
it
with
her
own
hands
but
bring
it
to
you
you
must
be
quite
obedient
she
tried
to
rise
but
i
held
her
against
my
breast
kiss
me
again
and
i
ll
promise
obedience
always
i
strove
to
say
but
my
voice
refused
so
long
a
sentence
and
anyhow
her
lips
were
on
my
own
before
i
could
have
finished
it
slowly
very
carefully
she
disentangled
herself
and
my
arms
sank
back
upon
the
coverlet
i
sighed
in
happiness
a
moment
longer
she
stood
beside
my
bed
gazing
down
with
love
and
deep
anxiety
into
my
face
and
when
all
is
eaten
all
mind
she
smiled
you
are
to
sleep
until
the
doctor
comes
this
afternoon
you
are
much
better
soon
you
shall
get
up
only
remember
shaking
her
finger
with
a
sweet
pretence
of
looking
stern
i
shall
exact
complete
obedience
you
must
yield
your
will
utterly
to
mine
you
are
in
my
heart
and
my
heart
must
be
kept
very
warm
and
her
eyes
were
tender
as
her
mother
s
and
i
loved
the
authority
and
strength
that
were
so
real
in
her
i
remembered
how
it
was
this
strength
that
had
sealed
the
contract
her
beauty
first
drew
up
for
me
to
sign
she
bent
down
once
more
to
arrange
my
pillows
what
happened
to
to
the
motor
i
asked
hesitatingly
for
my
thoughts
not
regulate
themselves
the
mind
presented
such
incongruous
fragments
the
what
she
asked
evidently
puzzled
the
word
seemed
strange
to
her
what
is
that
she
repeated
anxiety
in
her
eyes
i
made
an
effort
to
tell
her
but
i
could
not
explanation
was
suddenly
impossible
the
whole
idea
dived
away
out
of
sight
it
utterly
evaded
me
i
had
again
invented
a
word
that
was
without
meaning
i
was
talking
nonsense
in
its
place
my
dream
came
up
i
tried
to
tell
her
how
i
had
dreamed
of
climbing
dangerous
heights
with
a
stranger
and
had
spoken
another
language
with
him
than
my
own
english
was
it
at
any
rate
not
my
native
french
darling
she
whispered
close
into
my
ear
the
bad
dreams
will
not
come
back
you
are
safe
here
quite
she
put
her
little
hand
like
a
flower
on
my
forehead
and
drew
it
softly
down
the
cheek
your
wound
is
already
healing
they
took
the
bullet
out
four
days
ago
i
have
got
it
she
added
with
a
touch
of
shy
embarrassment
and
kissed
me
tenderly
upon
my
eyes
how
long
have
you
been
away
from
me
i
asked
feeling
exhaustion
coming
back
never
once
for
more
than
ten
minutes
was
the
reply
i
watched
with
you
all
night
only
this
morning
while
mother
took
my
place
i
slept
a
little
but
hush
she
said
with
dear
authority
again
you
are
not
to
talk
so
much
you
must
eat
what
i
have
brought
then
sleep
again
you
must
rest
and
sleep
my
love
i
shall
come
back
in
an
hour
and
i
shall
always
be
within
reach
of
your
dear
her
tall
slim
figure
dressed
in
the
grey
i
loved
crossed
silently
to
the
door
she
gave
me
one
more
look
there
was
all
the
tenderness
of
passionate
love
in
it
and
then
was
gone
i
followed
instructions
meekly
and
when
a
delicious
sleep
stole
over
me
soon
afterwards
i
had
forgotten
utterly
the
ugly
dream
that
i
was
climbing
dangerous
heights
with
another
man
forgotten
as
well
everything
else
except
that
it
seemed
so
many
days
since
my
love
had
come
to
me
and
that
my
bullet
wound
would
after
all
be
healed
in
time
for
our
wedding
on
the
day
so
long
so
eagerly
waited
for
and
when
several
hours
later
her
mother
came
in
with
the
doctor
his
face
less
grave
and
solemn
this
time
the
news
that
i
might
get
up
next
day
and
lie
a
little
in
the
garden
did
more
to
heal
me
than
a
thousand
bandages
or
twice
that
quantity
of
medical
instructions
i
watched
them
as
they
stood
a
moment
by
the
open
door
they
went
out
very
slowly
together
speaking
in
whispers
but
the
only
thing
i
caught
was
the
mother
s
voice
talking
brokenly
of
the
great
wars
napoleon
the
doctor
was
saying
in
a
low
hushed
tone
was
in
full
retreat
from
moscow
though
the
news
had
only
just
come
through
they
passed
into
the
corridor
then
and
there
was
a
sound
of
weeping
as
the
old
lady
murmured
something
about
her
son
and
the
cruelty
of
heaven
both
will
be
taken
from
me
she
was
sobbing
softly
while
he
stooped
to
comfort
her
one
in
marriage
and
the
other
in
they
closed
the
door
then
and
i
heard
no
more
i
convalescence
seemed
to
follow
very
quickly
then
for
i
was
utterly
obedient
as
i
had
promised
and
never
spoke
of
what
could
excite
me
to
my
own
detriment
the
wars
and
my
own
unfortunate
part
in
them
we
talked
instead
of
our
love
our
already
engagement
and
of
the
sweet
dream
of
happiness
that
life
held
waiting
for
us
in
the
future
and
indeed
i
was
sufficiently
weary
of
the
world
to
prefer
repose
to
much
activity
for
my
body
was
almost
incessantly
in
pain
and
this
old
garden
where
we
lay
between
high
walls
of
stone
aloof
from
the
busy
world
and
very
peaceful
was
far
more
to
my
taste
just
then
than
wars
and
fighting
the
orchards
were
in
blossom
and
the
winds
of
spring
showered
their
rain
of
petals
upon
the
long
new
grass
we
lay
half
in
sunshine
half
in
shade
beneath
the
poplars
that
lined
the
avenue
towards
the
lake
and
behind
us
rose
the
ancient
grey
stone
towers
where
the
jackdaws
nested
in
the
ivy
and
the
pigeons
cooed
and
fluttered
from
the
woods
beyond
there
was
loveliness
everywhere
but
there
was
sadness
too
for
though
we
both
knew
that
the
wars
had
taken
her
brother
whence
there
is
no
return
and
that
only
her
aged
failing
mother
s
life
stood
between
ourselves
and
the
stately
property
there
hid
a
sadness
yet
deeper
than
either
of
these
thoughts
in
both
our
hearts
and
it
was
i
think
the
sadness
that
comes
with
spring
for
spring
with
her
lavish
promises
of
eternal
beauty
is
ever
a
symbol
of
passing
human
happiness
incomplete
and
always
unfulfilled
promises
made
on
earth
are
playthings
after
all
for
children
even
while
we
make
them
so
solemnly
we
seem
to
know
they
are
not
meant
to
hold
they
are
made
as
spring
is
made
with
a
glory
of
soft
radiant
blossoms
that
pass
away
before
there
is
time
to
realise
them
and
yet
they
come
again
with
the
return
of
spring
as
unashamed
and
glorious
as
if
time
had
utterly
forgotten
and
this
sadness
was
in
her
too
i
mean
it
was
part
of
her
and
she
was
part
of
it
not
that
our
love
could
change
to
pass
or
die
but
that
its
sweet
accomplishment
must
hold
away
and
like
the
spring
must
melt
and
vanish
before
it
had
been
fully
known
i
did
not
speak
of
it
i
well
understood
that
the
depression
of
a
broken
body
can
influence
the
spirit
with
its
poisonous
melancholy
but
it
must
have
betrayed
itself
in
my
words
and
gestures
even
in
my
manner
too
at
any
rate
she
was
aware
of
it
i
think
if
truth
be
told
she
felt
it
too
it
seemed
so
painfully
inevitable
my
recovery
meanwhile
was
rapid
and
from
spending
an
hour
or
two
in
the
garden
i
soon
came
to
spend
the
entire
day
for
the
spring
came
on
with
a
rush
and
the
warmth
increased
deliciously
while
the
cuckoos
called
to
one
another
in
the
great
behind
the
château
we
sat
and
talked
and
sometimes
had
our
simple
meals
or
coffee
there
together
and
i
particularly
recall
the
occasion
when
solid
food
was
first
permitted
me
and
she
gave
me
a
delicate
young
fresh
caught
that
very
morning
in
the
lake
there
were
leaves
of
sweet
crisp
lettuce
with
it
and
she
picked
the
bones
out
for
me
with
her
own
white
hands
the
day
was
radiant
with
a
sky
of
cloudless
blue
soft
airs
stirred
the
poplar
crests
the
little
waves
fell
on
the
pebbly
beach
not
fifty
metres
away
and
the
orchard
floor
was
carpeted
with
flowers
that
seemed
to
have
caught
from
heaven
s
stars
the
patterns
of
their
yellow
blossoms
the
bees
droned
peacefully
among
the
fruit
trees
the
air
was
full
of
musical
deep
hummings
my
former
vigour
stirred
delightfully
in
my
blood
and
i
knew
no
pain
beyond
occasional
dull
twinges
in
the
head
that
came
with
a
rush
of
temporary
darkness
over
my
mind
the
scar
was
healed
however
and
the
hair
had
grown
over
it
again
this
temporary
darkness
alarmed
her
more
than
it
alarmed
me
there
were
grave
complications
apparently
that
i
did
not
know
of
but
the
sadness
in
me
seemed
independent
of
the
glorious
weather
due
to
causes
so
intangible
so
far
off
that
i
never
could
dispel
them
by
arguing
them
away
for
i
could
not
discover
what
they
actually
were
there
was
a
vague
distressing
sense
of
restlessness
that
i
ought
to
have
been
elsewhere
and
otherwise
that
we
were
together
for
a
few
days
only
and
that
these
few
days
i
had
snatched
unlawfully
from
stern
imperative
duties
these
duties
were
immediate
but
neglected
in
a
sense
i
had
no
right
to
this
springtide
of
bliss
her
presence
brought
me
i
was
playing
truant
somehow
somewhere
it
was
my
absence
from
the
regiment
that
i
know
it
was
infinitely
deeper
set
to
some
enormous
scale
that
vaguely
frightened
me
while
it
deepened
the
sweetness
of
the
stolen
joy
like
a
child
i
sought
to
pin
the
sunny
hours
against
the
sky
and
make
them
stay
they
passed
with
such
a
mocking
swiftness
snatched
momentarily
from
some
big
oblivion
the
twilights
swallowed
our
days
together
before
they
had
been
properly
tasted
and
on
looking
back
each
afternoon
of
happiness
seemed
to
have
been
a
mere
moment
in
a
flying
dream
and
i
must
have
somehow
betrayed
the
aching
mood
for
marion
turned
of
a
sudden
and
gazed
into
my
face
with
yearning
and
anxiety
in
the
sweet
brown
eyes
what
is
it
dearest
i
asked
and
why
do
your
eyes
bring
questions
you
sighed
she
answered
smiling
a
little
sadly
and
sighed
so
deeply
you
are
in
pain
again
the
darkness
perhaps
is
over
you
and
her
hand
stole
out
to
meet
my
own
you
are
in
pain
not
physical
pain
i
said
and
not
darkness
either
i
see
clearly
and
would
have
told
her
more
as
i
carried
her
soft
fingers
to
my
lips
had
i
not
divined
from
the
expression
in
her
eyes
that
she
read
my
heart
and
knew
all
my
strange
mysterious
forebodings
in
herself
i
know
she
whispered
before
i
could
find
speech
for
i
feel
it
too
it
is
the
shadow
of
separation
that
oppresses
you
yet
of
no
common
measurable
separation
you
can
understand
is
it
not
that
leaning
over
then
i
took
her
close
into
my
arms
since
words
in
that
moment
were
mere
foolishness
i
held
her
so
that
she
could
not
get
away
but
even
while
i
did
so
it
was
like
trying
to
hold
the
spring
or
fasten
the
flying
hour
with
a
fierce
desire
all
slipped
from
me
and
my
arms
caught
at
the
sunshine
and
the
wind
we
have
both
felt
it
all
these
weeks
she
said
bravely
as
soon
as
i
had
released
her
and
we
both
have
struggled
to
conceal
it
but
now
she
hesitated
for
a
second
and
with
so
exquisite
a
tenderness
that
i
would
have
caught
her
to
me
again
but
for
my
anxiety
to
hear
her
further
words
now
that
you
are
well
we
may
speak
plainly
to
each
other
and
so
lessen
our
pain
by
sharing
and
then
she
added
still
more
softly
you
feel
there
is
something
that
shall
take
you
from
me
yet
what
it
is
you
can
not
discover
nor
divine
tell
me
félix
all
your
thought
that
i
in
turn
may
tell
you
her
voice
floated
about
me
in
the
sunny
air
i
stared
at
her
striving
to
focus
the
dear
face
more
clearly
for
my
sight
a
shower
of
apple
blossoms
fell
about
us
and
her
words
seemed
floating
past
me
like
those
passing
petals
of
white
they
drifted
away
i
followed
them
with
difficulty
and
confusion
with
the
wind
i
fancied
a
veil
of
indefinable
change
slipped
across
her
face
and
eyes
yet
nothing
that
could
alter
feeling
i
answered
for
she
had
expressed
my
own
thought
completely
nor
anything
that
either
of
us
can
control
only
perhaps
that
everything
must
fade
and
pass
away
just
as
this
glory
of
the
spring
must
fade
and
pass
away
yet
leaving
its
sweetness
in
us
she
caught
me
up
passionately
and
to
come
again
my
beloved
to
come
again
in
every
subsequent
life
each
time
with
an
added
sweetness
in
it
too
her
little
face
showed
suddenly
the
courage
of
a
lion
in
its
eyes
her
heart
was
ever
braver
than
my
own
a
vigorous
fighting
soul
she
spoke
of
lives
i
prattled
of
days
and
hours
merely
a
touch
of
shame
stole
over
me
but
that
delicate
swift
change
in
her
spread
too
with
a
thrill
of
ominous
warning
i
noticed
how
it
rose
and
grew
about
her
from
within
outwards
it
seemed
to
pass
like
a
shadow
of
great
blue
distance
shadow
was
somewhere
in
it
so
that
she
dimmed
a
little
before
my
very
eyes
the
dreadful
yearning
searched
and
shook
me
for
i
could
not
understand
it
try
as
i
would
she
seemed
going
from
me
drifting
like
her
words
and
like
the
apple
blossoms
but
when
we
shall
no
longer
be
here
to
know
it
i
made
answer
quickly
yet
as
calmly
as
i
could
and
when
we
shall
have
passed
to
some
other
place
to
other
conditions
where
we
shall
not
recognise
the
joy
and
wonder
when
barriers
of
mist
shall
have
rolled
between
us
our
love
and
passion
so
that
we
shall
not
know
each
other
the
words
rushed
out
feverishly
half
beyond
control
and
perhaps
shall
not
even
dare
to
speak
to
each
other
of
our
deep
desire
i
broke
off
abruptly
conscious
that
i
was
speaking
out
of
some
unfamiliar
place
where
i
floundered
helpless
among
strange
conditions
i
was
saying
things
i
hardly
understood
myself
her
bigger
deeper
mood
spoke
through
me
perhaps
her
darling
face
came
back
again
she
moved
close
within
reach
once
more
hush
hush
she
whispered
terror
and
love
both
battling
in
her
eyes
it
is
the
truth
perhaps
but
you
must
not
say
such
things
to
speak
them
brings
them
closer
a
chain
is
about
our
hearts
a
chain
of
fashioning
lives
without
number
but
do
not
seek
to
draw
upon
it
with
anxiety
or
fear
to
do
so
can
only
cause
the
pain
of
wrong
entanglement
and
interrupt
the
natural
running
of
the
iron
and
she
placed
her
hand
swiftly
upon
my
mouth
as
though
divining
that
the
bleak
attack
of
anguish
was
again
upon
me
with
its
throbbing
rush
of
darkness
but
for
once
i
was
disobedient
and
resisted
the
physical
pain
i
realised
vividly
was
linked
closely
with
this
spiritual
torture
one
caused
the
other
somehow
the
disordered
brain
received
though
brokenly
some
hints
of
darker
and
unusual
knowledge
it
had
stammered
forth
in
me
but
through
her
it
flowed
easily
and
clear
i
saw
the
change
move
more
swiftly
then
across
her
face
some
ancient
look
passed
into
both
her
eyes
and
it
was
inevitable
i
must
speak
out
regardless
of
mere
bodily
we
shall
have
to
face
them
some
day
i
cried
although
the
effort
hurt
abominably
then
why
not
now
and
i
drew
her
hand
down
and
kissed
it
passionately
over
and
over
again
we
are
not
children
to
hide
our
faces
among
shadows
and
pretend
we
are
invisible
at
least
we
have
the
present
the
moment
that
is
here
and
now
we
stand
side
by
side
in
the
heart
of
this
deep
spring
day
this
sunshine
and
these
flowers
this
wind
across
the
lake
this
sky
of
blue
and
this
singing
of
the
birds
all
all
are
ours
let
us
use
the
moment
that
time
gives
and
so
strengthen
the
chain
you
speak
of
that
shall
bring
us
again
together
times
without
number
we
shall
then
perhaps
remember
oh
my
heart
think
what
that
would
mean
to
remember
exhaustion
caught
me
and
i
sank
back
among
my
cushions
but
marion
rose
up
suddenly
and
stood
beside
me
and
as
she
did
so
another
sky
dropped
softly
down
upon
us
both
and
i
smelt
again
the
incense
of
old
old
gardens
that
brought
perfumes
incredibly
sweet
but
with
it
an
ache
of
passionate
remembrance
that
was
pain
this
great
ache
of
distance
swept
over
me
like
a
wave
i
know
not
what
grand
change
then
was
wrought
upon
her
beauty
so
that
i
saw
her
defiant
and
erect
commanding
fate
because
she
understood
it
she
towered
over
me
but
it
was
her
soul
that
towered
the
rush
of
internal
darkness
in
me
blotted
out
all
else
the
familiar
present
sky
grew
dim
the
sunshine
faded
the
lake
and
flowers
and
poplars
dipped
away
conditions
a
thousand
times
more
vivid
took
their
place
she
stood
out
clear
and
shining
in
the
glory
of
an
undressed
soul
brave
and
confident
with
an
eternal
love
that
separation
strengthened
but
could
never
never
change
the
deep
sadness
i
abruptly
realised
was
very
little
removed
from
joy
because
somehow
it
was
the
condition
of
joy
i
could
not
explain
it
more
than
that
and
her
voice
when
she
spoke
was
firm
with
a
note
of
steel
in
it
intense
yet
devoid
of
the
wasting
anger
that
passion
brings
she
was
determined
beyond
death
itself
upon
a
foundation
sure
and
lasting
as
the
stars
the
heart
in
her
was
calm
because
she
she
was
magnificent
we
are
together
always
she
said
her
voice
rich
with
the
knowledge
of
some
unfathomable
experience
for
separation
is
temporary
merely
forging
new
links
in
the
ancient
chain
of
lives
that
binds
our
hearts
eternally
she
looked
like
one
who
has
conquered
the
adversity
time
brings
by
accepting
it
you
speak
of
the
present
as
though
our
souls
were
already
fitted
now
to
bid
it
stay
needing
no
further
fashioning
looking
only
to
the
future
you
forget
our
ample
past
that
has
made
us
what
we
are
yet
our
past
is
here
and
now
beside
us
at
this
very
moment
into
the
hollow
cups
of
weeks
and
months
of
years
and
centuries
time
pours
its
flood
beneath
our
eyes
time
is
our
schoolroom
are
you
so
soon
afraid
does
not
separation
achieve
that
which
companionship
never
could
accomplish
and
how
shall
we
dare
eternity
together
if
we
can
not
be
strong
in
separation
first
i
listened
while
a
flood
of
memories
broke
up
through
film
upon
film
and
layer
upon
layer
that
had
long
covered
them
this
present
that
we
seem
to
hold
between
our
hands
she
went
on
in
that
earnest
distant
voice
our
moment
of
sweet
remembrance
that
you
speak
of
of
renewal
perhaps
too
of
reconciliation
a
fleeting
instant
when
we
may
kiss
again
and
say
but
with
strengthened
hope
and
courage
revived
but
we
may
not
stay
together
finally
we
until
long
discipline
and
pain
shall
have
perfected
sympathy
and
schooled
our
love
by
searching
difficult
tests
that
it
may
last
for
i
stretched
my
arms
out
dumbly
to
take
her
in
her
face
shone
down
upon
me
bathed
in
an
older
fiercer
sunlight
the
change
in
her
seemed
in
an
instant
then
complete
some
big
soft
wind
blew
both
of
us
ten
thousand
miles
away
the
centuries
gathered
us
back
together
look
rather
to
the
past
she
whispered
grandly
where
first
we
knew
the
sweet
opening
of
our
love
remember
if
you
can
how
the
pain
and
separation
have
made
it
so
worth
while
to
continue
and
be
braver
she
turned
her
eyes
more
fully
upon
my
own
so
that
their
light
persuaded
me
utterly
away
with
her
an
immense
new
happiness
broke
over
me
i
listened
and
with
the
stirrings
of
an
ampler
courage
it
seemed
i
followed
her
down
an
interminable
vista
of
remembrance
till
i
was
happy
with
her
among
the
flowers
and
fields
of
our
earliest
her
voice
came
to
me
with
the
singing
of
birds
and
the
hum
of
summer
insects
have
you
so
soon
forgotten
she
sighed
when
we
knew
together
the
perfume
of
the
hanging
babylonian
gardens
or
when
the
hesperides
were
so
soft
to
us
in
the
dawn
of
the
world
and
do
you
not
remember
with
a
little
rise
of
passion
in
her
voice
the
sweet
plantations
of
chaldea
and
how
we
tasted
the
odour
of
many
a
drooping
flower
in
the
gardens
of
alcinous
and
adonis
when
the
bees
of
olden
time
picked
out
the
honey
for
our
eating
it
is
the
fragrance
of
those
first
hours
we
knew
together
that
still
lies
in
our
hearts
sweetening
our
love
to
this
apparent
suddenness
hence
comes
the
full
deep
happiness
we
gather
so
easily
the
breast
of
every
ancient
forest
is
torn
with
storms
and
lightning
that
s
why
it
is
so
soft
and
full
of
little
gardens
you
have
forgotten
too
easily
the
glades
of
lebanon
where
we
whispered
our
earliest
secrets
while
the
big
winds
drove
their
chariots
down
those
earlier
skies
there
rose
an
indescribable
tempest
of
remembrance
in
my
heart
as
i
strove
to
bring
the
pictures
into
focus
but
words
failed
me
and
the
hand
i
eagerly
stretched
out
to
touch
her
own
met
only
sunshine
and
the
rain
of
apple
blossoms
the
myrrh
and
frankincense
she
continued
in
a
sighing
voice
that
seemed
to
come
with
the
wind
from
invisible
caverns
in
the
sky
the
grapes
and
pomegranates
have
they
all
passed
from
you
with
the
train
of
apes
and
peacocks
the
tigers
and
the
ibis
and
the
hordes
of
slaves
and
this
little
sun
that
plays
so
lightly
here
upon
our
woods
of
beech
and
pine
does
it
bring
back
nothing
of
the
scorching
when
the
olive
slopes
the
figs
and
ripening
cornfields
heard
our
vows
and
watched
our
love
mature
our
spread
encampment
in
the
desert
do
not
these
sands
upon
our
little
beach
revive
its
lonely
majesty
for
you
and
have
you
forgotten
the
gleaming
towers
of
semiramis
or
in
sardis
those
strange
lilies
that
first
tempted
our
souls
to
their
divine
disclosure
conscious
of
a
violent
struggle
between
pain
and
joy
both
too
deep
for
me
to
understand
i
rose
to
seize
her
in
my
arms
but
the
effort
dimmed
the
flying
pictures
the
wind
that
bore
her
voice
down
the
stupendous
vista
fled
back
into
the
caverns
whence
it
came
and
the
pain
caught
me
in
a
vice
of
agony
so
searching
that
i
could
not
move
a
muscle
my
tongue
lay
dry
against
my
lips
i
could
not
frame
a
word
of
any
sentence
her
voice
presently
came
back
to
me
but
fainter
like
a
whisper
from
the
stars
the
light
dimmed
everywhere
i
saw
no
more
the
vivid
shining
scenery
she
had
summoned
a
mournful
dusk
instead
crept
down
upon
the
world
she
had
momentarily
revived
we
may
not
stay
together
i
heard
her
little
whisper
until
long
discipline
shall
have
perfected
sympathy
and
schooled
our
love
to
last
for
this
love
of
ours
for
ever
and
the
pain
that
tries
it
is
the
furnace
that
fashions
precious
stones
again
i
stretched
my
arms
out
her
face
shone
a
moment
longer
in
that
forgotten
fiercer
sunlight
then
faded
very
swiftly
the
change
like
a
veil
passed
over
it
from
the
place
of
prodigious
distance
where
she
had
been
she
swept
down
towards
me
with
such
dizzy
speed
as
she
was
i
saw
her
again
more
and
more
pain
and
separation
then
are
welcome
i
tried
to
stammer
and
we
will
desire
them
but
my
thought
got
no
further
into
expression
than
the
first
two
words
aching
blotted
out
coherent
utterance
she
bent
down
very
close
against
my
face
her
fragrance
was
about
my
lips
but
her
voice
ran
off
like
a
faint
thrill
of
music
far
far
away
i
caught
the
final
words
dying
away
as
wind
dies
in
high
branches
of
a
wood
and
they
reached
me
this
time
through
the
droning
of
bees
and
of
waves
that
murmured
close
at
hand
upon
the
shore
for
our
love
is
of
the
soul
and
our
souls
are
moulded
in
eternity
it
is
not
yet
it
is
not
now
our
perfect
consummation
nor
shall
our
next
time
of
meeting
know
it
we
shall
not
even
speak
for
i
shall
not
be
free
was
what
i
heard
she
paused
you
mean
we
shall
not
know
each
other
i
cried
in
an
anguish
of
spirit
that
mastered
the
lesser
physical
pain
i
barely
caught
her
answer
my
discipline
then
will
be
in
another
s
keeping
yet
only
that
i
may
come
back
to
you
more
perfect
in
the
end
the
bees
and
waves
then
cushioned
her
whisper
with
their
humming
the
trail
of
a
deeper
silence
led
them
far
away
the
rush
of
temporary
darkness
passed
and
lifted
i
opened
my
eyes
my
love
sat
close
beside
me
in
the
shadow
of
the
poplars
one
hand
held
both
my
own
while
with
the
other
she
arranged
my
pillows
and
stroked
my
aching
head
the
world
dropped
back
into
a
tiny
scale
once
more
you
have
had
the
pain
again
marion
murmured
anxiously
but
it
is
better
now
it
is
she
kissed
my
cheek
you
must
come
in
but
i
would
not
let
her
go
i
held
her
to
me
with
all
the
strength
that
was
in
me
i
had
it
but
it
s
gone
again
an
awful
darkness
came
with
it
i
whispered
in
the
little
ear
that
was
so
close
against
my
mouth
i
ve
been
dreaming
i
told
her
as
memory
dipped
away
dreaming
of
you
and
me
together
somewhere
in
old
gardens
or
forests
where
the
sun
was
but
she
would
not
let
me
finish
i
think
in
any
case
i
could
not
have
said
more
for
thought
evaded
me
and
any
language
of
coherent
description
was
in
the
same
instant
beyond
my
power
exhaustion
came
upon
me
that
vile
compelling
nausea
with
it
the
sun
here
is
too
strong
for
you
dear
love
i
heard
her
saying
and
you
must
rest
more
we
have
been
doing
too
much
these
last
few
days
you
must
have
more
she
rose
to
help
me
move
indoors
i
have
been
unconscious
then
i
asked
in
the
feeble
whisper
that
was
all
i
could
manage
for
a
little
while
you
slept
while
i
watched
over
but
i
was
away
from
you
oh
how
could
you
let
me
sleep
when
our
time
together
is
so
short
she
soothed
me
instantly
in
the
way
she
knew
we
both
loved
so
i
clung
to
her
until
she
released
herself
again
not
away
from
me
she
smiled
for
i
was
with
you
in
your
of
course
of
course
you
were
but
already
i
knew
not
exactly
why
i
said
it
nor
caught
the
deep
meaning
that
struggled
up
into
my
words
from
such
unfathomable
distance
come
she
added
with
her
sweet
authority
again
we
must
go
in
now
give
me
your
arm
and
i
will
send
out
for
the
cushions
lean
on
me
i
am
going
to
put
you
back
to
but
i
shall
sleep
again
i
said
petulantly
and
we
shall
be
we
shall
dream
together
she
replied
as
she
helped
me
slowly
and
painfully
towards
the
old
grey
walls
of
the
château
ii
half
an
hour
later
i
slept
deeply
peacefully
upon
my
bed
in
the
big
stately
chamber
where
the
roses
watched
beside
the
latticed
windows
and
to
say
i
dreamed
again
is
not
correct
for
it
can
only
be
expressed
by
saying
that
i
saw
and
knew
the
figures
round
the
bed
were
actual
and
in
life
nothing
could
be
more
real
than
the
whisper
of
the
doctor
s
voice
that
solemn
man
who
was
so
tall
as
he
said
sternly
yet
brokenly
to
some
one
you
must
say
and
you
had
better
say
it
nor
could
anything
be
more
definite
and
sure
more
charged
with
the
actuality
of
living
than
the
figure
of
marion
as
she
stooped
over
me
to
obey
the
terrible
command
for
i
saw
her
face
float
down
towards
me
like
a
star
and
a
shower
of
pale
spring
blossoms
rained
upon
me
with
her
hair
the
perfume
of
old
old
gardens
rose
about
me
as
she
slipped
to
her
knees
beside
the
bed
and
kissed
my
lips
so
softly
it
was
like
the
breath
of
wind
from
lake
and
orchard
and
so
lingeringly
it
was
as
though
the
blossoms
lay
upon
my
mouth
and
grew
into
flowers
that
she
planted
there
my
love
be
brave
it
is
only
it
is
death
i
tried
to
say
but
could
only
feebly
stir
my
lips
against
her
own
i
drew
her
breath
of
flowers
into
my
mouth
and
there
came
then
the
darkness
which
is
final
the
voices
grew
louder
i
heard
a
man
struggling
with
an
unfamiliar
language
turning
restlessly
i
opened
my
eyes
upon
a
little
stuffy
room
with
white
walls
whereon
no
pictures
hung
it
was
very
hot
a
woman
was
standing
beside
the
bed
and
the
bed
was
very
short
i
stretched
and
my
feet
kicked
against
the
boarding
at
the
end
yes
he
awake
the
woman
said
in
french
will
you
come
in
the
doctor
said
you
might
see
him
when
he
woke
i
think
he
ll
know
she
spoke
in
french
i
just
knew
enough
to
understand
and
of
course
i
knew
him
it
was
haddon
i
heard
him
thanking
her
for
all
her
kindness
as
he
blundered
in
his
french
if
anything
was
worse
than
my
own
i
felt
inclined
to
laugh
i
did
laugh
by
jove
old
man
this
is
bad
luck
isn
t
it
you
ve
had
a
narrow
shave
this
good
lady
telegraphed
have
you
got
my
is
it
all
right
i
asked
i
remembered
clearly
the
motor
accident
everything
the
is
right
enough
he
laughed
looking
cheerfully
at
the
woman
but
what
about
yourself
feel
bad
still
any
pain
i
mean
oh
i
feel
all
right
i
answered
searching
for
the
pain
of
broken
bones
but
finding
none
what
happened
i
was
stunned
i
suppose
bit
stunned
yes
said
haddon
you
got
a
nasty
knock
on
the
head
it
seems
the
point
of
the
axe
ran
into
you
or
was
that
all
he
nodded
but
i
m
afraid
it
s
knocked
our
climbing
on
the
head
shocking
bad
luck
isn
t
it
i
telegraphed
last
night
the
kind
woman
was
explaining
but
i
couldn
t
get
here
till
this
morning
haddon
said
the
telegram
didn
t
find
me
till
midnight
you
and
he
turned
to
thank
the
woman
in
his
voluble
dreadful
french
she
kept
a
little
pension
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
it
was
the
nearest
house
and
they
had
carried
me
in
there
and
got
the
doctor
to
me
all
within
the
hour
it
proved
slight
enough
apart
from
the
shock
it
was
not
even
concussion
i
had
merely
been
stunned
sleep
had
cured
me
as
it
seemed
jolly
little
place
said
haddon
as
he
moved
me
that
afternoon
to
geneva
whence
after
a
few
days
rest
we
went
on
into
the
alps
of
haute
savoie
and
lucky
the
old
body
was
so
kind
and
quick
odd
wasn
t
it
he
glanced
at
me
something
in
his
voice
betrayed
he
hid
another
thought
i
saw
nothing
odd
in
it
at
all
only
very
tiresome
what
s
its
name
i
asked
taking
a
shot
at
a
venture
he
hesitated
a
second
haddon
the
climber
was
not
skilled
in
the
delicacies
of
tact
don
t
know
its
present
name
he
answered
looking
away
from
me
across
the
lake
but
it
stands
on
the
site
of
an
old
château
destroyed
a
hundred
years
ago
the

then
i
understood
my
old
friend

confusion

also
to
be
the
name
of
a
married
woman
