girl
on
the

next
to

whispered
norma

of

chapter
i
girls
in
uniform
norma
kent
stirred
uneasily
her
army
cot
creaked
you
ll
have
to
lie
still
she
told
herself
sternly
you
ll
keep
the
other
girls
even
as
she
thought
this
the
girl
on
the
cot
next
to
her
own
half
rose
to
whisper
we
re
hobby
s
horses
that
s
the
girl
called
betty
norma
thought
as
she
barely
suppressed
a
disturbing
laugh
shish
she
managed
to
whisper
then
all
was
silent
where
row
on
row
fifty
girls
were
sleeping
fifty
and
norma
had
spoken
to
barely
half
a
dozen
of
them
it
was
all
very
strange
strange
and
exciting
yes
it
had
surely
been
all
that
they
had
all
been
jumpy
nervous
as
colts
on
the
train
from
chicago
if
they
were
walking
down
the
aisle
and
the
train
tipped
they
had
laughed
loudly
they
had
been
nervous
laughs
and
why
not
had
they
not
launched
themselves
on
a
new
and
striking
adventure
as
norma
recalled
all
this
she
suddenly
started
then
rose
silently
on
one
shoulder
she
had
caught
a
flash
of
light
where
no
light
was
supposed
to
be
a
flash
of
light
she
whispered
silently
at
the
same
instant
she
caught
the
gleam
of
light
once
more
this
time
she
located
the
head
of
the
cot
by
the
nearest
window
rosa
rosetti
she
thought
with
a
start
she
did
not
know
the
girl
barely
recalled
her
name
she
had
a
beaming
smile
yet
beyond
doubt
was
what
would
you
do
if
you
suspected
that
someone
was
a
spy
that
question
had
not
hours
before
been
put
to
her
by
a
very
important
person
she
had
answered
as
best
she
could
had
her
answer
been
the
correct
one
her
reply
had
been
nothing
at
least
not
at
now
she
settled
back
in
her
place
the
flash
of
light
from
the
head
of
rosa
rosetti
s
cot
did
not
shine
again
nor
did
norma
kent
fall
asleep
at
once
a
flash
of
light
in
the
night
she
was
thinking
how
very
unimportant
and
yet
as
her
thoughts
drifted
back
to
her
childhood
days
not
so
long
was
barely
now
and
just
out
of
recalled
a
story
told
by
her
father
a
world
war
veteran
the
story
dealt
with
a
stranger
in
an
american
uniform
who
claiming
to
be
lost
from
his
outfit
had
found
refuge
in
their
billet
for
the
night
that
night
her
father
had
said
flashes
of
light
were
noticed
at
the
window
of
our
attic
lodging
and
that
night
too
our
village
was
suppose
we
are
bombed
tonight
the
girl
thought
then
she
laughed
silently
for
she
was
lodged
deep
in
the
heart
of
iowa
at
old
fort
des
moines
as
the
name
drifted
through
her
dreamy
thoughts
it
gave
her
a
start
she
was
fully
awake
again
for
the
full
weight
of
the
tremendous
move
she
had
made
came
crashing
back
upon
her
i
m
a
wac
she
whispered
a
wac
i
m
in
the
army
now
yes
that
was
it
she
was
a
member
of
the
woman
s
army
corps
so
too
were
all
the
girls
sleeping
so
peacefully
there
here
at
fort
des
moines
in
four
short
weeks
they
would
receive
their
basic
training
and
i
may
drive
a
truck
she
thought
with
a
thrill
or
operate
an
army
set
or
help
watch
for
enemy
planes
along
the
seacoast
she
caught
her
breath
i
may
be
sent
north
africa
the
solomons
the
bleak
shores
of
these
and
more
drifted
before
her
mind
s
eye
come
what
may
she
whispered
i
am
ready
she
might
have
fallen
asleep
then
had
not
a
cot
less
than
ten
feet
from
her
given
out
a
low
creak
as
a
tall
strong
girl
who
had
caught
her
eye
from
the
first
sat
straight
up
in
her
bed
to
whisper
three
words
the
words
were
whispered
in
a
foreign
tongue
norma
was
mildly
shocked
at
hearing
them
whispered
here
in
the
night
she
was
talking
in
her
sleep
norma
assured
herself
as
the
girl
settled
quietly
back
in
her
place
then
it
came
to
her
with
the
force
of
a
blow
she
too
might
be
a
spy
what
nonsense
she
chided
herself
how
jittery
i
am
tonight
i
ll
go
to
sleep
and
here
s
hoping
i
don
t
she
did
fall
asleep
and
she
did
not
dream
from
some
place
very
very
far
away
a
bugle
was
blowing
and
someone
seemed
to
sing
i
can
t
get
em
up
i
can
t
get
em
up
i
can
t
get
em
up
in
the
then
an
alarm
clock
went
off
with
a
bang
and
norma
the
wac
recruit
was
awake
her
feet
hit
the
floor
with
a
slap
and
she
was
putting
on
her
clothes
before
she
knew
it
a
race
to
the
washroom
a
hasty
a
dash
of
color
to
her
cheeks
and
twenty
minutes
later
together
with
thirty
other
raw
recruits
she
lined
up
for
assembly
it
was
bitter
cold
a
sharp
wind
was
blowing
a
bleak
dawn
was
showing
in
the
east
norma
shivered
in
spite
of
her
thick
tweed
coat
she
looked
at
the
slender
girl
next
to
her
and
was
ashamed
the
girl
s
lips
were
blue
her
thin
and
threadbare
coat
flapped
in
the
breeze
she
wanted
to
wrap
this
girl
inside
her
coat
but
did
not
this
would
be
quite
unsoldierlike
so
she
stood
at
rigid
attention
but
out
of
the
corner
of
her
mouth
she
said
it
won
t
be
long
now
those
soldier
suits
we
ll
wear
are
it
t
long
the
girl
replied
cheerfully
through
chattering
teeth
norma
permitted
herself
one
quick
flashing
look
to
right
and
left
to
her
right
beyond
the
slender
girl
stood
the
tall
girl
who
had
whispered
so
strangely
in
her
sleep
wrapped
in
a
long
black
fur
coat
she
stood
primly
at
attention
there
was
something
about
this
girl
s
prim
indifference
to
those
about
her
that
irritated
norma
she
turned
to
the
left
to
find
herself
looking
into
a
pair
of
smiling
blue
eyes
the
girl
said
never
a
word
but
her
bright
smile
spoke
volumes
this
girl
s
dress
short
squirrelskin
coat
heavy
skirt
neat
shoes
and
small
hat
spoke
both
of
taste
and
money
beyond
this
girl
stood
the
little
italian
who
flashed
a
light
at
night
she
stood
lips
parted
eyes
shining
sturdy
young
body
erect
very
sure
of
herself
and
unafraid
whatever
happens
i
m
going
to
like
her
a
lot
and
that
can
t
be
helped
norma
assured
herself
five
minutes
later
they
were
all
back
in
the
barracks
making
up
their
bunks
and
preparing
for
a
busy
day
ahead
bedding
down
hobby
s
horses
said
a
laughing
voice
say
what
does
that
mean
norma
demanded
looking
up
from
her
work
into
a
pair
of
laughing
blue
eyes
don
t
you
know
asked
the
other
girl
as
she
sat
down
on
her
cot
i
don
t
that
s
a
fact
norma
admitted
well
i
ll
tell
you
but
first
the
other
girl
put
out
a
hand
my
name
s
betty
gale
something
tells
me
that
we
ve
both
just
finished
college
and
that
we
re
likely
to
be
pals
in
this
great
adventure
until
death
or
some
lady
major
does
us
you
re
right
in
the
first
count
norma
laughed
and
i
hope
you
are
in
the
second
my
name
is
norma
swell
said
betty
gale
hobby
s
chapter
ii
the
test
that
told
mrs
hobby
s
betty
laughed
that
s
really
no
great
secret
perhaps
you
didn
t
notice
it
but
we
ve
been
sleeping
in
a
a
stable
norma
stared
a
stable
with
polished
floors
oh
they
fixed
them
up
of
course
but
the
row
of
buildings
to
which
this
belongs
was
all
stables
only
a
short
while
for
horses
why
not
betty
laughed
again
fort
des
moines
has
always
been
a
cavalry
oh
and
i
suppose
it
was
from
these
very
stables
that
cavalry
horsemen
rode
thundering
away
to
fight
the
absolutely
how
romantic
norma
exclaimed
but
i
still
don
t
see
what
that
s
got
to
do
with
hobby
i
didn
t
say
hobby
horses
i
said
they
called
us
hobby
s
horses
don
t
you
see
betty
s
voice
dropped
mrs
hobby
is
director
of
the
corps
and
they
say
she
s
a
wonder
all
of
us
raw
recruits
must
spend
a
week
in
these
stables
before
we
go
to
live
in
boom
town
so
you
see
they
call
us
hobby
s
but
boom
town
where
s
that
norma
demanded
oh
come
on
betty
exclaimed
you
want
to
know
too
much
too
soon
let
s
get
our
bunks
made
we
have
a
lot
of
things
to
do
this
day
one
of
them
is
to
eat
breakfast
that
cold
air
made
me
hungry
let
s
get
a
short
time
later
they
found
themselves
caught
in
a
brown
stream
of
wacs
pouring
toward
a
long
low
building
once
inside
they
were
greeted
with
the
glorious
odor
of
frying
bacon
brewing
coffee
and
all
that
goes
with
a
big
delicious
breakfast
and
was
it
big
in
this
mess
hall
hundred
girls
were
being
served
as
she
joined
the
long
line
that
moved
rapidly
forward
norma
was
all
but
overcome
by
the
feeling
that
she
was
part
of
something
mammoth
and
wonderful
it
s
big
she
exclaimed
biggest
thing
in
all
the
betty
pressed
her
arm
we
re
in
the
army
now
yes
they
were
in
the
army
and
this
was
army
food
on
their
sectional
trays
oatmeal
toast
and
bacon
were
piled
their
cups
were
a
marvel
to
behold
half
an
inch
thick
big
as
a
pint
jar
and
entirely
void
of
handles
they
presented
a
real
problem
but
norma
mastered
the
art
of
an
army
coffee
drinker
in
one
stride
so
too
did
millie
the
girl
from
a
department
store
boy
millie
giggled
balancing
her
cup
in
one
hand
now
let
the
japs
come
i
ll
get
one
of
them
and
never
even
nick
this
cup
honest
she
confided
i
think
this
is
going
to
be
fun
and
lots
of
work
was
norma
s
reply
oh
work
millie
sobered
lead
me
to
it
it
can
t
be
worse
than
shield
s
bargain
basement
during
the
christmas
rush
it
s
can
you
find
me
this
or
can
you
give
me
that
and
miss
martin

this
and

that
hours
and
hours
on

customers
bossy
floorwalkers
and
for
what
i
ask
you
sixteen
dollars
a
week
could
you
live
on
that
norma
asked
in
surprise
no
but
i
did
millie
giggled
but
honest
i
think
this
will
be
a
lot
it
s
not
so
much
a
matter
of
it
being
better
or
worse
norma
replied
soberly
as
it
is
of
what
we
have
to
give
this
is
war
you
know
our
war
yes
i
the
little
salesgirl
it
seems
had
a
serious
side
to
her
nature
i
ve
thought
about
that
too
in
the
city
where
they
examined
us
they
said
i
might
do
library
work
i
sold
books
you
know
and
i
know
an
awful
lot
about
them
and
i
can
cook
too
she
added
hopefully
they
have
a
cooking
and
baking
school
betty
encouraged
they
teach
you
how
to
cook
in
a
mess
hall
and
out
of
doors
for
a
few
people
and
a
great
many
perhaps
for
a
thousand
people
at
a
time
and
you
do
it
all
in
the
baggage
car
of
a
special
little
me
cooking
for
a
thousand
people
millie
wilted
like
an
unwatered
flower
honest
girls
i
m
just
scared
stiff
i
couldn
t
go
back
i
just
couldn
t
i
d
rather
die
and
today
they
give
us
our
special
interviews
and
you
ll
make
it
all
right
betty
assured
her
just
drink
the
rest
of
your
coffee
that
will
pep
you
once
again
millie
lifted
her
huge
army
cup
here
s
to
us
all
she
laughed
at
that
they
clinked
their
cups
and
drank
to
their
day
that
had
just
begun
found
norma
sitting
at
the
end
of
a
row
of
girls
waiting
her
turn
at
a
private
interview
in
open
booths
interviewers
sat
smilingly
asking
questions
in
low
tones
of
new
recruits
and
carefully
writing
down
the
answers
in
her
row
as
she
sat
waiting
her
turn
norma
saw
lena
the
tall
strong
girl
who
whispered
strangely
in
the
night
rosa
who
had
flashed
a
light
betty
millie
and
a
few
others
as
she
began
to
be
a
little
afraid
the
interviewers
were
smiling
but
after
all
those
were
serious
smiles
she
could
not
hear
the
questions
she
could
guess
them
these
interviewers
were
asking
what
can
you
do
what
would
you
like
most
to
do
what
else
can
you
do
all
of
a
sudden
norma
realized
that
she
had
never
done
a
real
day
s
work
in
all
her
life
she
had
always
gone
to
school
oh
yes
she
could
cook
just
a
little
but
so
little
i
guess
she
thought
that
i
m
what
they
call
a
typical
american
college
girl
not
a
bad
student
and
not
too
good
fairly
good
at
tennis
and
basketball
i
ve
got
brown
hair
and
eyes
and
i
m
not
too
tall
nor
yet
too
she
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
a
good
fellow
and
all
that
but
she
sobered
what
can
i
do
what
do
i
want
to
do
what
else
can
i
do
she
had
felt
a
little
sorry
for
the
shopgirl
millie
now
she
envied
her
millie
knew
all
about
books
and
she
could
really
cook
at
this
very
moment
smiling
with
confidence
millie
was
stepping
into
a
booth
for
her
and
she
norma
kent
a
college
graduate
sat
there
shivering
in
her
boots
surely
this
was
a
strange
world
the
booth
that
millie
had
entered
was
wide
open
norma
could
see
all
but
hear
nothing
of
what
went
on
at
first
she
was
interested
in
watching
the
smiles
and
frowns
that
played
across
millie
s
frank
and
mobile
face
of
a
sudden
her
interest
was
caught
and
held
by
the
examiner
tall
slim
looking
very
much
the
soldier
in
her
neatly
pressed
uniform
that
bore
a
lieutenant
s
bar
on
its
shoulder
this
examiner
seemed
just
what
norma
hoped
in
time
to
real
soldier
she
s
not
too
thirty
the
girl
told
herself
and
she
s
wearing
some
sort
of
medal
pinned
to
her
breast
say
that
s
strange
and
indeed
it
was
strange
the
woman
s
army
corps
was
as
yet
very
young
only
a
few
had
gone
overseas
and
none
as
far
as
she
knew
had
either
won
honors
or
returned
to
america
she
s
keen
she
whispered
to
the
girl
next
to
her
who
the
girl
stared
that
examiner
nonna
nodded
toward
the
booth
oh
oh
sure
the
other
girl
resumed
polishing
her
nails
all
the
same
she
is
norma
told
herself
and
i
d
like
to
know
as
millie
the
shopgirl
at
last
rose
from
her
place
a
happy
smile
played
about
her
lips
she
made
it
norma
said
aloud
and
am
i
glad
she
smiled
at
millie
as
she
passed
lena
the
night
whisperer
was
next
to
enter
the
vacated
booth
as
the
interviewer
began
her
task
her
body
appeared
to
stiffen
on
her
guard
norma
thought
i
wonder
on
the
officer
s
face
there
was
still
a
smile
but
somehow
it
was
a
different
sort
of
smile
and
the
tall
girl
she
too
seemed
rather
strange
she
appeared
always
on
her
guard
as
if
she
were
speaking
a
piece
and
feared
she
might
forget
was
norma
s
thought
still
in
the
end
all
must
have
gone
well
for
as
she
passed
her
on
the
way
out
the
tall
girl
flashed
norma
a
look
that
said
plainer
than
words
see
that
s
how
you
do
whatever
may
have
been
norma
s
reactions
to
this
they
were
quickly
lost
for
suddenly
she
realized
that
the
black
eyes
of
the
examining
officer
were
upon
her
and
that
her
name
was
being
called
her
time
had
come
swallowing
hard
she
rose
to
step
into
the
booth
you
are
norma
kent
said
the
examiner
flashing
her
a
friendly
smile
and
your
home
greenvale
illinois
was
the
prompt
reply
the
date
of
her
birth
when
she
entered
and
left
grade
school
high
school
and
college
and
other
details
followed
and
now
said
the
examiner
leaning
forward
what
can
you
do
really
don
t
know
the
girl
faltered
i
ve
never
worked
at
ah
so
you
ve
never
worked
can
you
cook
not
very
i
the
examiner
studied
norma
s
face
how
many
in
your
family
just
father
and
and
your
father
what
does
he
do
he
s
with
the
telephone
company
in
charge
of
a
wide
and
all
the
examiner
studied
her
report
just
two
of
you
you
should
be
great
are
norma
s
eyes
shone
you
see
she
exclaimed
dad
was
in
the
other
world
war
i
ve
always
loved
him
for
that
he
was
in
france
said
the
examiner
with
a
quick
intake
of
breath
norma
did
not
at
all
understand
what
a
lovely
land
to
die
dad
lost
his
right
arm
norma
stated
in
a
tone
that
s
why
he
can
t
go
back
this
time
that
s
why
he
wants
me
to
would
you
like
to
go
overseas
the
examiner
s
eyes
shone
with
a
strange
new
light
i
d
love
to
the
girl
whispered
hoarsely
but
what
could
i
do
oh
loads
of
the
examiner
made
a
record
on
her
sheet
your
father
must
have
driven
about
a
great
deal
looking
things
over
in
his
present
of
did
you
ever
go
with
him
oh
many
many
times
did
you
ever
assist
him
oh
yes
of
course
it
was
all
great
fun
he
had
big
charts
showing
every
center
every
phone
i
helped
him
mark
down
each
new
ah
the
examiner
breathed
yes
and
we
had
a
grand
little
shop
in
the
basement
where
we
worked
things
of
new
norma
s
eyes
shone
there
were
many
rural
centers
where
the
switchboards
were
in
stores
when
a
number
was
called
a
light
shone
on
the
board
but
that
wasn
t
enough
the
storekeeper
couldn
t
always
see
the
and
what
did
you
do
about
it
we
fixed
up
a
new
board
just
dad
and
i
put
a
tiny
bell
on
every
i
see
the
light
flashed
the
bell
rang
and
then
the
storekeeper
really
knew
all
about
it
yes
but
the
light
sometimes
failed
so
we
put
on
bells
with
different
tones
each
line
spoke
for
norma
laughed
we
called
it
the
musical
and
you
say
you
ve
never
worked
the
examiner
laughed
that
why
that
was
just
fun
perhaps
it
was
the
best
work
in
the
world
is
the
kind
we
can
think
of
as
fun
all
that
time
you
were
fitting
yourself
for
two
of
our
most
important
and
interceptor
you
really
use
me
norma
was
close
to
tears
can
we
oh
my
child
the
examiner
all
but
embraced
her
we
ll
make
a
major
out
of
you
see
if
we
don
t
chapter
iii
interceptor
control
norma
was
not
long
in
discovering
the
reason
for
that
last
surprising
outburst
of
her
examiner
when
at
last
the
report
was
finished
they
looked
up
to
find
the
row
of
chairs
empty
well
the
examiner
breathed
that
s
all
for
today
this
she
added
is
not
my
regular
work
my
training
was
finished
many
weeks
ago
i
have
been
away
from
the
fort
for
some
time
doing
she
a
rather
special
sort
of
work
now
i
m
back
for
a
brief
spell
they
were
shorthanded
so
you
ve
been
helping
out
that
s
the
examiner
rose
norma
too
stood
we
all
have
one
great
purpose
each
of
us
must
do
what
she
can
wherever
she
to
bring
this
terrible
war
to
an
end
norma
added
you
re
right
again
the
other
smiled
whew
she
exclaimed
after
looking
norma
over
from
head
to
toe
you
certainly
do
look
i
should
norma
grinned
our
college
has
put
us
through
training
i
can
tell
you
we
marched
five
miles
in
shorts
with
the
snow
blowing
across
the
field
climbed
fences
i
ll
the
examiner
smiled
yes
and
walls
too
we
did
gym
work
and
took
corrective
grand
they
were
preparing
you
just
that
s
swell
my
name
is
the
officer

out
a
hand
lieutenant
rita
warren
to
be
exact
i
m
going
up
to
boom
town
want
to
go
along
i
d
love
to
right
then
come
let
s
swinging
into
the
regulation
stride
lieutenant
warren
marched
out
of
the
hall
with
her
recruit
and
along
the
path
that
interceptor
control
sounds
intriguing
norma
said
as
they
marched
over
the
crusted
snow
oh
it
is
it
really
is
lieutenant
warren
s
face
glowed
the
most
interesting
work
in
the
world
i
ll
tell
you
a
little
about
it
but
don
t
let
me
tell
you
too
i
ll
flash
the
red
norma
laughed
as
she
asked
how
much
is
too
much
lieutenant
warren
did
not
answer
instead
she
said
we
are
stationed
along
the
just
any
seacoast
any
coast
of
america
there
are
a
number
of
us
in
each
group
we
take
over
some
small
hotel
the
hotel
is
run
just
for
must
be
grand
oh
it
is
but
we
don
t
have
much
time
to
think
of
that
we
have
work
to
do
plenty
of
it
you
see
along
every
coast
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
volunteer
watchers
they
are
there
day
and
watching
for
enemy
planes
yes
that
s
it
and
for
possible
enemy
but
none
have
come
not
yet
but
let
us
relax
our
see
what
happens
if
an
aircraft
carrier
stole
in
close
in
the
fog
and
sent
over
fifty
bombing
planes
thousands
would
die
that
must
never
no
never
norma
s
hand
clenched
hard
that
s
the
why
of
the
interceptor
do
the
wacs
help
with
the
watching
in
a
way
yes
but
not
out
on
the
sandbanks
and
rocky
that
s
done
by
volunteers
yes
the
wac
works
inside
there
s
plenty
to
be
done
if
an
enemy
plane
is
sighted
just
plenty
this
she
said
changing
the
subject
is
boom
town
six
months
ago
it
was
open
norma
looked
up
then
stared
so
interested
had
she
become
in
their
talk
that
she
had
failed
to
note
that
they
were
now
passing
before
a
long
row
of
new
red
brick
buildings
illustration
this
she
said
changing
the
subject
is
boom
the
ones
are
barracks
her
companion
explained
some
of
the
buildings
are
company
headquarters
some
are
mess
halls
and
some
day
day
rooms
norma
was
puzzled
day
rooms
that
you
mostly
visit
at
night
lieutenant
warren
laughed
lights
in
the
barracks
are
out
at
most
of
the
girls
prefer
to
retire
then
when
you
ve
been
here
three
days
you
ll
know
why
some
hardy
souls
wish
to
stay
up
another
hour
so
they
retire
to
the
day
room
to
lounge
in
easy
chairs
write
letters
read
or
play
cards
bed
check
is
at
you
d
better
be
in
bed
by
then
or
you
ll
get
a
black
every
night
norma
asked
in
surprise
from
saturday
noon
to
sunday
night
is
all
your
own
you
ll
learn
about
that
for
a
moment
they
walked
on
in
silence
it
was
norma
who
broke
that
silence
can
you
tell
me
a
little
of
what
the
wacs
of
the
interceptor
control
do
a
little
is
right
was
the
quick
reply
much
of
it
is
a
deep
deep
secret
you
d
love
it
all
i
know
but
listen
this
is
how
it
works
she
went
on
some
high
school
girl
is
watching
from
a
cliff
there
are
many
girl
watchers
and
how
faithful
they
are
this
girl
hears
a
plane
in
the
dark
it
s
off
shore
she
rushes
to
a
phone
and
calls
a
number
a
wac
at
the
switchboard
and
then
norma
whispered
then
the
girl
on
the
cliff
says
one
single
high
off
five
miles
going
the
wac
knows
from
the
spot
on
the
switchboard
where
the
girl
is
she
reports
the
call
another
girl
locates
the
spot
on
a
chart
a
third
wac
reports
to
three
men
one
of
these
men
represents
the
army
one
the
navy
and
one
the
civil
aeronautics
authority
these
men
consult
their
records
perhaps
they
discover
that
no
plane
belonging
to
any
of
their
organizations
is
supposed
to
be
on
that
and
then
they
send
out
a
fighting
plane
norma
suggested
not
yet
perhaps
that
girl
watcher
heard
a
vacuum
sweeper
instead
of
a
plane
so
they
and
then
perhaps
two
minutes
later
there
comes
a
flash
from
another
time
a
fisherman
s
wife
flash
one
single
high
going
south
very
three
hundred
miles
an
hour
someone
says
then
a
fighter
plane
goes
up
and
soon
if
it
s
really
an
attack
the
sky
will
be
filled
with
fighter
lives
lives
saved
by
the
wacs
norma
enthused
we
shall
have
done
our
part
lieutenant
warren
replied
modestly
and
that
is
all
our
country
expects
from
any
of
lieutenant
norma
asked
suddenly
in
a
low
tone
did
you
notice
anything
unusual
about
the
two
girls
who
went
into
your
booth
just
ahead
of
me
why
me
see
lieutenant
paused
to
consider
one
was
rather
short
and
italian
stock
and
the
tall
yes
now
i
recall
her
very
unusual
quite
different
in
character
but
capable
i
d
say
they
ll
fit
in
of
course
they
re
both
of
foreign
extraction
the
tall
girl
s
parents
were
she
s
an
american
as
we
all
are
she
was
raised
by
her
uncle
something
unusual
did
you
say
why
did
you
ask
that
she
fixed
her
dark
eyes
on
norma
s
puzzled
face
nothing
i
guess
no
real
reason
at
all
m
sorry
i
asked
i
wouldn
t
hurt
for
all
the
of
course
you
wouldn
t
my
the
lieutenant
pressed
her
arm
lieutenant
warren
seemed
fairly
bursting
in
her
enthusiasm
for
the
interceptor
control
she
told
norma
more
much
more
as
they
marched
along
then
suddenly
as
if
waking
from
a
trance
she
stopped
dead
in
her
tracks
to
exclaim
softly
oh
what
have
i
been
telling
you
i
shouldn
t
have
breathed
a
word
of
that
it
s
so
hard
not
to
talk
about
a
thing
that
s
got
a
grip
on
your
very
soul
promise
me
you
won
t
breathe
a
word
of
it
i
promise
norma
said
quietly
i
m
sure
i
know
how
important
it
do
you
know
some
sprite
might
have
whispered
soon
enough
the
girl
was
to
learn
come
on
in
here
the
lieutenant
said
a
moment
later
i
must
pick
up
a
suit
i
ve
had
the
air
in
the
large
room
they
entered
was
heavy
with
steam
on
this
side
said
the
lieutenant
pushing
a
door
open
a
crack
is
the
beauty
parlor
some
young
reporters
have
made
fun
of
it
as
if
it
were
a
crime
for
a
soldier
to
look
well
those
girls
working
in
there
she
said
as
she
closed
the
door
are
civilians
they
come
over
from
the
city
every
day
sometimes
they
worry
worry
you
norma
was
puzzled
yes
you
see
they
re
not
checked
norma
stared
their
records
you
know
after
all
this
is
an
army
camp
and
as
such
is
just
packed
with
secrets
we
send
out
a
thousand
freshly
trained
wacs
a
week
one
of
these
days
we
ll
be
sending
a
trainload
all
at
once
where
are
they
going
are
they
being
sent
overseas
will
they
be
secretaries
to
commanding
officers
what
other
important
tasks
will
they
perform
our
enemy
would
like
to
know
all
this
and
much
more
and
these
hairdressers
just
come
and
go
who
are
they
no
one
but
have
been
checked
have
you
been
checked
the
lieutenant
whispered
oh
my
dear
the
knows
all
about
you
your
fingerprints
are
in
washington
your
life
from
the
time
you
were
born
has
been
checked
and
so
none
of
us
could
possibly
turn
out
to
be
spies
norma
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
i
wouldn
t
quite
say
that
her
companion
replied
thoughtfully
but
it
would
be
very
oh
norma
exclaimed
fussing
at
her
hair
do
you
suppose
i
could
possibly
get
my
hair
set
i
can
t
see
why
not
this
is
a
slack
i
m
going
to
try
it
the
girl
exclaimed
tomorrow
i
ll
be
getting
my
uniform
won
t
i
yes
you
then
my
cap
must
be
fitted
try
it
and
good
the
lieutenant
held
out
a
hand
it
s
been
a
pleasure
to
talk
to
oh
norma
exclaimed
i
want
to
see
you
many
many
times
my
visit
here
at
this
time
is
short
but
in
the
future
here
s
in
the
future
here
s
hoping
norma
whispered
to
herself
as
she
passed
through
the
door
chapter
iv
a
light
in
the
night
on
entering
the
small
crowded
beauty
parlor
norma
found
only
one
vacant
chair
she
looked
at
the
girl
standing
behind
the
chair
spanish
norma
thought
and
yet
her
eyes
were
set
at
a
slant
like
those
of
an
oriental
for
all
this
she
was
decidedly
not
an
oriental
oh
norma
thought
she
looks
capable
it
will
soon
be
time
for
rattling
those
trays
again
and
do
i
need
to
get
my
fingers
wrapped
round
one
of
those
mugs
of
strong
coffee
boy
has
this
been
a
day
hair
set
she
said
as
she
settled
back
in
her
chair
without
a
word
the
girl
went
to
work
she
was
half
finished
before
she
spoke
then
in
the
most
casual
manner
she
said
lieutenant
warren
is
a
friend
of
yours
norma
was
surprised
the
door
had
been
opened
only
a
little
way
and
for
a
space
of
seconds
yet
this
girl
had
seen
yes
was
her
noncommittal
reply
it
is
always
quite
fine
to
have
an
officer
for
a
friend
she
can
help
you
tell
you
things
and
guide
you
suggested
the
hairdresser
suppose
so
norma
murmured
she
told
you
about
the
interceptor
control
the
girl
s
whisper
invited
confidence
at
once
norma
was
on
her
guard
we
talked
about
boom
town
she
replied
evenly
it
s
interesting
built
so
quickly
and
all
that
yet
it
looks
warm
and
boom
town
oh
yes
it
s
quite
these
words
were
spoken
without
enthusiasm
after
that
they
talked
about
trivial
shampoos
and
the
weather
twice
the
strange
girl
led
back
to
the
interceptor
control
twice
norma
led
her
away
again
now
why
would
she
a
hairdresser
want
to
talk
about
interceptor
control
she
asked
herself
as
she
left
the
chair
she
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
the
tall
recruit
lena
waiting
to
take
her
place
more
surprising
was
the
fact
that
as
lena
s
eyes
met
the
hairdresser
s
there
appeared
to
pass
between
them
an
instant
flash
of
recognition
and
lena
hasn
t
been
on
the
grounds
a
whole
day
she
thought
with
a
start
spies
her
mind
registered
as
she
left
the
building
then
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
spies
in
the
heart
of
america
she
whispered
in
a
woman
s
camp
i
m
getting
a
spy
ghosts
under
the
bed
what
s
the
matter
with
me
that
evening
not
wishing
to
retire
at
the
lights
out
signal
she
sought
out
the
day
room
that
is
used
at
night
and
found
it
it
was
a
comfortable
place
that
day
room
half
underground
it
was
not
subject
to
draft
a
large
round
stove
gave
off
a
genial
glow
and
plenty
of
heat
a
large
cushioned
lounging
chair
awaited
her
only
one
other
girl
was
in
the
room
lena
the
one
who
whispers
in
the
night
norma
thought
guess
she
s
lena
was
not
asleep
for
as
norma
sank
into
her
chair
she
opened
one
eye
and
drawled
had
a
good
day
didn
t
you
just
fine
was
the
smiling
reply
hobnobbing
with
the
brass
was
there
a
suggestion
of
a
sneer
on
lena
s
face
if
it
was
there
norma
chose
to
ignore
it
there
don
t
seem
to
be
any
brass
hats
around
this
place
she
replied
oh
aren
t
there
the
girl
exclaimed
you
just
wait
at
that
the
girl
caught
herself
well
she
finished
lamely
i
ll
admit
i
ve
been
treated
tomorrow
we
get
measured
for
our
uniforms
she
added
your
uniform
should
need
very
little
norma
could
not
help
admiring
the
girl
s
look
of
perfect
fitness
and
form
as
she
stood
up
i
didn
t
get
it
sitting
round
lena
laughed
i
m
going
out
for
some
air
and
a
look
at
the
moon
you
re
rather
a
perfect
yourself
she
said
over
her
shoulder
as
she
marched
toward
the
door
norma
wondered
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
how
lena
had
got
her
training
she
knew
about
her
own
it
hadn
t
been
easy
after
a
time
she
began
wondering
about
the
moon
seeing
it
shine
over
the
stables
the
barracks
and
mess
halls
would
be
a
pleasant
experience
she
wasn
t
dressed
for
the
outdoors
so
she
stepped
to
the
window
and
looked
up
she
did
not
see
the
moon
instead
her
eyes
fell
upon
two
shadowy
figures
one
was
lena
the
other
too
was
a
girl
just
another
raw
recruit
she
thought
but
then
the
girl
turned
so
the
light
of
a
distant
lamp
was
on
her
face
she
was
the
girl
who
had
done
norma
s
hair
that
afternoon
should
have
been
back
in
the
city
hours
ago
she
told
herself
it
all
seemed
very
strange
to
her
where
had
lena
known
this
girl
before
or
had
she
why
were
they
together
now
only
time
could
tell
and
perhaps
time
wouldn
t
she
was
just
thinking
of
retiring
when
lena
again
entered
the
room
seating
herself
before
the
fire
she
held
out
her
hands
to
warm
them
for
some
time
neither
girl
spoke
at
last
leaning
far
over
and
speaking
in
a
hoarse
whisper
lena
said
you
know
that
little
italian
girl
rosa
what
about
rosa
i
think
she
s
a
spy
i
saw
her
flashing
a
light
in
the
night
her
cot
is
by
the
window
you
know
came
in
lena
s
insinuating
whisper
oh
do
you
really
think
so
there
was
little
encouragement
in
norma
s
tone
who
s
a
spy
these
words
were
on
her
lips
she
did
not
say
them
nor
having
said
them
could
she
have
given
the
answer
two
days
later
found
them
all
in
uniform
and
did
they
look
grand
oh
millie
norma
exclaimed
you
look
like
a
million
dollars
do
i
then
i
m
millie
beamed
i
was
afraid
i
d
still
look
like
a
how
does
a
salesgirl
look
betty
asked
oh
sort
of
at
that
they
both
laughed
it
s
the
grandest
outfit
i
ever
had
millie
exclaimed
such
a
soft
warm
woolen
suit
and
such
tailoring
and
my
coat
oh
gee
i
feel
like
christmas
morning
the
shoes
weren
t
marked
down
to
two
dollars
and
cents
either
said
betty
i
ve
had
a
lot
of
fine
shoes
but
none
better
than
that
afternoon
a
corporal
formed
them
into
a
betty
lena
millie
rosa
and
five
other
girls
then
they
began
to
drill
one
two
left
right
left

the
corporal
called
squad
right
squad
left
march
march
doublequick
march
some
of
the
girls
found
it
difficult
to
keep
in
step
and
maintain
that
stride
but
not
norma
the
whole
manual
of
drill
was
an
old
story
to
her
soon
they
were
joined
by
other
squads
then
eager
that
her
squad
might
look
its
best
when
the
lieutenant
who
had
taken
them
over
was
not
near
norma
began
calling
in
a
hoarse
whisper
the
counts
and
changes
left
right
left
right
squad
right
march
double
quick
they
drilled
until
many
a
girl
was
ready
to
cry
when
they
broke
ranks
lieutenant
drury
singled
out
norma
s
squad
say
she
exclaimed
you
girls
are
wonderful
been
practicing
behind
the
stable
or
somewhere
it
s
her
millie
nodded
toward
norma
she
keeps
us
that
s
swell
how
come
the
lieutenant
turned
to
norma
i
knew
it
all
before
i
was
five
years
old
norma
laughed
my
father
was
an
officer
in
the
last
war
and
i
am
his
only
boy
he
started
drilling
me
when
i
was
a
mere
tot
i
liked
it
so
we
kept
it
up
that
s
all
there
is
to
well
the
lieutenant
laughed
i
guess
there
are
many
of
us
who
are
our
fathers
only
sons
and
by
the
grace
of
god
we
ll
make
them
mighty
proud
of
us
before
this
old
war
is
done
that
night
in
a
corner
of
the
day
room
norma
had
a
little
time
all
by
herself
her
father
was
home
all
alone
now
the
chair
she
had
occupied
by
the
fire
for
so
long
was
empty
now
and
would
be
for
a
long
time
but
i
wouldn
t
go
back
she
told
herself
biting
her
lip
not
for
worlds
and
he
would
not
want
her
back
she
recalled
his
parting
words
at
the
train
norma
voice
had
been
husky
for
a
long
time
i
wanted
a
son
now
i
m
proud
to
have
a
daughter
to
give
for
the
defense
of
my
country
get
in
there
girl
and
fight
perhaps
you
ll
not
be
carrying
a
gun
but
you
ll
be
taking
a
fighting
man
s
place
and
i
m
sure
you
ll
help
show
those
fine
boys
how
a
girl
can
live
like
a
soldier
and
die
like
one
if
need
i
ll
be
back
she
had
whispered
when
the
war
is
that
night
lena
may
have
whispered
in
her
sleep
she
may
even
have
gone
out
to
talk
with
her
hairdresser
if
so
norma
knew
nothing
of
it
she
was
too
weary
for
that
she
retired
early
she
did
however
remain
awake
long
enough
to
twice
catch
the
gleam
of
light
from
rosa
s
cot
she
liked
the
little
italian
girl
once
again
she
recalled
one
question
asked
her
back
there
in
chicago
she
had
been
given
a
final
examination
before
her
induction
into
the
service
one
of
the
women
in
that
examining
group
she
had
been
told
was
a
psychologist
in
the
back
of
her
mind
all
during
the
examination
she
had
asked
herself
which
one
is
she
when
a
little
lady
with
keen
dark
eyes
had
leaned
forward
to
ask
if
you
suspected
that
one
of
your
companions
was
a
spy
what
would
you
do
flash
came
to
her
she
s
the
she
had
thought
the
question
over
then
replied
slowly
if
i
saw
her
setting
a
fire
or
stealing
papers
i
d
report
her
at
but
if
not
the
little
lady
had
insisted
if
i
merely
suspected
that
she
was
a
spy
i
d
wait
and
watch
that
s
all
had
been
her
whole
reply
in
the
eyes
of
her
examiners
she
had
read
approval
that
s
what
she
was
doing
and
waiting
all
the
same
she
told
herself
now
i
m
going
to
ask
rosa
why
she
flashes
that
light
at
chapter
v
spy
complex
the
next
day
three
things
happened
norma
saw
her
favorite
lieutenant
she
asked
rosa
a
question
and
received
a
surprising
reply
and
millie
the
shopgirl
who
was
in
the
army
now
led
them
all
in
an
amusing
adventure
that
might
not
have
turned
out
so
well
in
the
afternoon
they
drilled
as
a
squad
as
a
platoon
and
as
a
company
it
was
a
hard
workout
but
to
norma
it
was
a
thrilling
adventure
all
this
is
the
real
thing
she
exclaimed
once
i
ll
say
it
is
betty
laughed
these
new
shoes
are
burning
up
my
feet
it
s
the
real
mccoy
all
the
same
norma
insisted
it
s
what
i
ve
been
training
for
all
my
life
my
father
thought
it
was
just
for
fun
for
after
all
i
was
a
how
little
he
knew
betty
replied
soberly
marching
and
drilling
were
not
hard
for
norma
she
had
time
to
think
of
other
things
she
began
studying
the
ancient
fort
and
the
atmosphere
that
hung
about
it
like
a
cloud
she
had
begun
to
love
the
place
and
at
times
found
herself
wishing
that
she
might
remain
here
for
a
long
time
four
weeks
seem
terribly
short
she
told
betty
it
may
be
much
longer
betty
suggested
you
might
join
the
motor
transport
school
and
learn
to
drive
a
truck
in
a
yes
and
i
might
not
was
her
reply
or
attend
the
bakers
and
cooks
school
betty
suggested
not
that
well
then
betty
exclaimed
since
you
re
so
awfully
good
at
this
drilling
stuff
perhaps
they
d
let
you
attend
the
officers
training
she
murmured
now
you
re
talking
maybe
i
don
t
on
that
particular
day
as
a
bright
winter
sun
shone
down
on
the
long
parade
ground
norma
thought
only
of
the
old
fort
and
what
it
stood
for
it
was
quite
ancient
but
just
how
old
she
could
not
tell
always
a
lover
of
horses
she
tried
to
picture
the
parade
ground
in
those
old
days
when
a
thousand
perhaps
two
thousand
men
all
mounted
on
glorious
cavalry
horses
came
riding
down
that
stretch
of
green
dignified
officers
in
the
playing
and
horses
prancing
what
a
picture
she
murmured
on
each
side
of
the
parade
ground
were
rows
of
red
brick
buildings
on
the
right
side
had
been
the
homes
of
officers
now
these
were
occupied
by
the
officers
of
the
school
on
the
opposite
side
were
barracks
occupied
by
officer
candidates
in
training
that
s
where
i
d
be
training
she
thought
with
a
little
thrill
if
i
applied
for
entrance
and
was
on
bright
warm
days
she
had
been
told
the
whole
school
six
thousand
strong
assembled
on
the
parade
ground
and
marched
down
the
field
that
she
thought
would
be
glorious
she
hoped
that
they
would
have
fine
weather
before
she
went
away
it
was
after
drill
was
over
that
a
rather
strange
thing
happened
there
was
she
had
discovered
an
air
of
grim
serious
determination
about
this
place
that
was
almost
depressing
you
seldom
heard
a
laugh
there
was
always
the
of
feet
even
now
when
her
squad
of
ten
had
been
put
on
their
own
and
they
were
headed
for
the
service
club
for
a
bottle
of
coke
or
a
cup
of
hot
chocolate
they
were
still
going
in
regular
file
it
s
a
little
bit
too
much
she
thought
just
at
that
moment
a
shrill
voice
cried
out
sharply
left
right
one
two
one
she
recognized
that
voice
it
was
millie
the
shopgirl
for
a
space
of
seconds
they
kept
up
the
steady
tramp
tramp
tramp
then
with
a
burst
of
laughter
they
all
took
up
the
chant
one
two
they
kept
this
up
to
the
very
door
of
the
club
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
chant
ended
with
a
low
escape
of
breath
there
in
front
of
the
club
stood
a
captain
of
the
wacs
as
they
filed
past
the
girls
saluted
and
the
captain
gravely
returned
their
salute
wasn
t
that
terrible
millie
whispered
gripping
norma
s
arm
and
i
started
it
you
suppose
they
ll
put
me
in
the
guardhouse
i
don
t
know
norma
hesitated
the
guardhouse
no
wac
is
ever
put
in
there
i
guess
it
wasn
t
so
bad
we
were
just
letting
off
steam
that
was
truth
was
she
didn
t
know
the
answer
of
one
thing
she
was
for
one
felt
better
for
this
little
bit
of
gaiety
the
service
club
had
a
cheerful
atmosphere
about
it
straight
ahead
as
they
entered
they
saw
at
the
back
of
a
fairly
large
lounging
room
a
fire
in
a
large
open
fireplace
from
the
right
where
chairs
stood
about
small
tables
came
the
pleasant
odor
of
hot
coffee
and
chocolate
as
norma
turned
to
the
right
she
caught
the
eye
of
lieutenant
warren
she
was
seated
alone
at
a
table
sipping
coffee
at
once
she
motioned
to
norma
to
come
sit
across
from
her
with
some
hesitation
norma
joined
her
what
will
you
have
it
s
on
me
the
lieutenant
smiled
that
coffee
smells
just
right
was
the
reply
sweet
roll
or
cookies
sweet
roll
but
please
let
me
get
them
no
no
permit
me
lieutenant
warren
was
away
that
training
you
received
at
college
was
fine
the
lieutenant
said
when
they
were
seated
grand
stuff
i
only
wish
all
colleges
went
in
for
it
and
they
will
our
quota
now
is
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
it
will
be
a
half
million
before
you
know
but
lieutenant
warren
norma
s
brow
puckered
we
re
not
to
carry
guns
are
we
no
that
s
not
then
why
all
this
drilling
we
re
going
in
for
hard
trucks
carrying
messages
on
motorcycles
repairing
radios
cars
airplanes
we
re
to
take
the
places
of
soldiers
so
they
can
carry
guns
and
fight
we
ve
got
to
be
as
that
s
not
the
lieutenant
s
eyes
shone
learning
to
drill
properly
is
learning
to
obey
orders
that
s
necessary
if
i
say
to
you
take
this
message
down
that
road
where
the
bullets
are
flying
you
ve
jolly
well
got
to
do
see
norma
repeated
you
don
t
mind
this
drilling
do
you
i
love
it
this
time
norma
s
eyes
shone
i
thought
so
and
you
know
a
great
deal
about
more
than
most
of
the
girl
agreed
hesitatingly
with
your
permission
i
am
going
to
suggest
that
you
be
given
a
company
to
oh
oh
please
no
norma
held
up
a
hand
the
tone
was
low
you
saw
me
examining
recruits
i
was
the
only
officer
doing
that
didn
t
all
the
same
it
was
true
why
do
you
think
i
did
it
because
you
wished
to
serve
norma
replied
in
a
low
voice
but
with
me
it
would
be
a
step
up
too
we
are
in
a
war
a
step
up
or
down
does
not
matter
all
that
matters
is
that
we
should
be
prepared
for
that
step
you
are
well
prepared
you
won
t
refuse
i
won
t
refuse
the
girl
answered
solemnly
lieutenant
norma
said
in
a
low
tone
a
moment
later
when
i
had
my
interview
they
asked
me
what
i
d
do
if
i
suspected
someone
of
being
a
spy
why
did
they
ask
me
that
the
psychologist
was
taking
your
measure
that
was
a
problem
question
the
answer
would
give
her
a
slant
on
your
general
then
they
don
t
expect
to
find
a
spy
among
the
wacs
it
s
not
impossible
for
a
spy
to
join
our
ranks
but
certainly
not
easy
you
filled
out
a
questionnaire
that
told
every
place
you
had
lived
and
when
every
school
you
attended
and
and
if
i
had
been
working
i
would
have
had
to
tell
how
long
and
when
why
i
quit
and
all
the
rest
all
the
same
norma
spoke
slowly
guardedly
spies
have
gotten
into
every
sort
of
place
so
you
think
we
have
a
spy
the
lieutenant
s
voice
was
low
anything
you
d
like
to
tell
me
no
okay
let
s
skip
it
but
just
one
thing
we
all
need
to
be
careful
about
members
of
our
organization
who
are
children
of
the
it
s
easy
to
do
them
an
injustice
too
easy
they
form
a
large
group
in
our
population
take
that
little
italian
girl
over
there
she
s
an
attractive
young
that
s
true
norma
agreed
and
that
big
her
parents
are
what
a
truck
driver
she
d
make
yes
sure
she
the
lieutenant
gave
norma
a
short
sharp
look
nothing
more
was
said
a
moment
later
millie
stood
by
their
table
there
was
a
worried
look
on
the
shopgirl
s
face
wasn
t
that
terrible
she
did
not
smile
what
s
so
terrible
the
lieutenant
smiled
what
we
did
a
little
while
ago
said
millie
want
to
tell
me
about
it
the
lieutenant
asked
millie
dropped
into
a
chair
to
tell
the
story
of
their
hilarious
march
now
she
exclaimed
at
the
end
it
was
i
who
started
it
what
will
they
do
to
me
nothing
was
the
instant
response
quite
as
quickly
rewarded
by
a
golden
smile
you
were
on
your
own
the
lieutenant
explained
we
want
you
to
be
happy
when
an
army
loses
its
sense
of
humor
it
begins
losing
m
so
glad
millie
exclaimed
but
let
me
tell
the
lieutenant
held
up
a
warning
hand
there
are
other
times
and
places

an
example

up
by
your
cots

are
no
wrinkles
in
your
blanket
that
your
locker
is
in
order
and
open
that
your
shoes
towel
washcloth
and
laundry
bag
are
in
place
and
above
all
look
straight
ahead
don
t
smile
don
t
frown
just
don
t
move
a
even
if
a
fly
gets
inside
your
glasses
or
a
bee

away
after

long
after
rosa
had
read
her
prayer
and
left
the
room
norma
sat
staring
at
the
fire
in
that
fire
she
read
many
questions
would
she
be
asked
to
drill
a
company
should
she
ask
for
the
privilege
of

officers
training

from

noon
until
sunday
night
needless
to
say
over
at
the
mess
hall
in
the
barracks
and
on
the
field
there
was
much
talk
among
the
new
recruits
about
how
these
hours
were
to
be
spent
what
do
you
do
norma
asked
a
tall
slender
girl
from
massachusetts
who
had
been
in
training
for
three
weeks
well
the
girl
drawled
the
first
week
i
went
dashing
off
to
des
moines

a
room
at
a
nice
hotel

oysters
on
the
boston
baked
beans
brown
bread
and
all
the
things

a
grand
time

books

library

down
in
a
big
chair
at
the
service
club
and
but

norma
asked
in
surprise

it
is
a
girl
from
texas
exclaimed
beth

just
lazy
that

all
des
moines
is
a
nice
big
overgrown
town
all
full
of
nice
friendly
people

has
the
grandest
eating
spots

and
halls
where

exclaimed
a
girl
from
indiana
there

soldiers
and
sailors
who
come
in
from
their
camps
and
all
sorts
of
college
a
nice
big
overgrown
town
all
full
of
nice
friendly
norma
recalled
these
words
later
truth
was
she
found
herself
a
little
homesick
at
that
moment
she
would
have
loved
a
good
romp
with
her
dog
spark
and
after
that
a
quiet
talk
with
her
dad
i
know
what
i
ll
do
she
thought
and
i
won
t
tell
a
soul
they
d
laugh
at
betty
who
more
than
any
girl
at
camp
had
begun
to
seem
norma
s
chum
had
decided
to
stay
in
camp
when
the
day
came
norma
too
remained
until
four
o
clock
part
of
the
time
she
spent
having
her
hair
washed
and
set
it
was
no
accident
that
she
took
the
chair
of
the
spanish
hairdresser
who
served
her
before
i
ll
bring
up
the
subject
of
the
interceptor
control
if
she
asks
questions
i
ll
tell
her
things
i
read
in
that
little
book
called
the
battle
of
anything
that
s
been
published
then
perhaps
i
ll
string
her
a
the
hairdresser
fell
for
the
bait
norma
loaded
her
up
with
commonly
known
facts
then
drew
pictures
from
her
fertile
imagination
in
the
end
she
was
hearing
planes
at
unbelievable
distances
but
why
are
you
so
interested
in
all
this
she
asked
at
last
the
girl
shot
her
a
swift
look
oh
miss
kent
she
was
a
shrill
note
in
her
it
is
all
so
very
interesting
everything
you
wacs
do
is
thrilling
it
is
a
great
organization
yes
norma
agreed
it
is
one
of
the
big
things
that
has
come
out
of
the
to
herself
she
was
recalling
lieutenant
warren
s
words
these
girls
worry
me
a
little
their
records
have
not
been
then
again
she
remembered
how
her
own
record
had
been
checked
to
the
last
detail
the
examiners
do
not
take
your
word
for
a
thing
she
had
been
told
the
questionnaire
you
filled
out
is
checked
and
by
men
who
know
even
your
fingerprints
are
sent
to
all
this
she
knew
was
true
and
yet
the
girls
in
the
beauty
parlor
were
not
checked
that
tall
girl
lena
could
tell
this
hairdresser
anything
at
all
if
she
became
the
secretary
to
a
colonel
she
could
report
anything
to
this
but
it
came
to
her
with
the
force
of
a
lena
s
record
has
been
checked
her
fingerprints
were
sent
to
what
a
silly
young
fool
you
are
she
chided
herself
as
a
short
time
later
she
took
the
car
to
des
moines
but
she
was
not
even
sure
of
that
arrived
at
the
heart
of
the
city
she
looked
up
a
long
street
to
see
a
tall
inviting
brick
hotel
standing
on
a
hill
illustration
yet
the
girls
in
the
beauty
parlor
were
not
after
walking
and
climbing
for
fifteen
minutes
she
found
herself
entering
a
long
room
filled
with
lounge
chairs
and
lined
on
two
walls
by
tall
glass
cases
the
contents
of
these
cases
surprised
her
for
in
them
were
more
kinds
of
mounted
fish
than
she
had
ever
seen
oh
she
exclaimed
am
i
in
the
wrong
place
is
this
a
museum
no
the
smiling
bellboy
who
took
her
bag
replied
this
hotel
was
once
owned
by
a
very
rich
man
who
collected
fish
he
s
dead
but
his
collection
lives
she
wondered
vaguely
what
would
live
on
when
she
was
gone
the
first
thing
she
did
when
she
had
been
shown
to
a
neat
and
comfortable
room
was
strange
opening
her
bag
she
took
out
a
cardboard
folder
tied
with
a
ribbon
from
this
folder
she
selected
a
dozen
pictures
these
she
proceeded
to
thumbtack
one
by
one
to
the
wall
directly
under
a
mellow
light
after
that
without
further
unpacking
she
dropped
into
a
chair
and
sat
for
a
long
time
looking
at
those
pictures
through
moist
eyelashes
the
house
with
the
broad
lawn
and
tall
shade
trees
about
it
was
her
home
the
tall
distinguished
looking
man
with
one
empty
sleeve
was
her
dad
the
picture
done
in
color
was
her
college
chum
and
the
grinning
young
man
in
the
uniform
of
a
private
was
plain
bill
there
were
other
pictures
but
these
were
the
ones
that
counted
most
they
had
adorned
the
walls
of
her
room
at
college
for
a
long
time
when
you
bunk
in
a
a
glorious
glorified
a
hundred
other
girls
you
don
t
thumbtack
your
pictures
to
the
wall
it
isn
t
allowed
besides
it
would
be
silly
norma
wanted
to
see
her
pictures
in
their
proper
setting
now
she
was
seeing
them
norma
you
re
a
silly
goose
she
told
herself
aloud
then
she
wondered
whether
she
had
spoken
the
truth
sometimes
one
drops
into
a
new
world
too
hastily
it
does
one
good
to
take
a
look
back
it
was
bill
who
had
started
her
thinking
of
the
wacs
she
and
bill
were
grand
good
friends
that
s
all
no
diamond
talk
of
wedding
friends
all
the
same
when
bill
came
to
the
school
all
togged
up
in
a
new
uniform
she
had
felt
a
big
tug
at
her
heart
strings
oh
bill
she
had
cried
you
look
like
a
million
and
i
feel
like
a
millionaire
was
bill
s
reply
army
life
is
the
berries
and
regarding
the
japs
all
i
ve
got
to
say
is
they
d
better
look
out
getting
pretty
good
with
a
tommy
gun
bill
she
laughed
and
how
was
his
prompt
reply
they
found
a
log
down
among
the
willows
at
the
edge
of
the
campus
and
there
bill
in
his
big
boisterous
way
told
her
all
about
the
army
oh
bill
she
exclaimed
when
he
had
finished
you
make
it
sound
so
wonderful
i
wish
they
d
let
girls
they
do
bill
stopped
grinning
ever
heard
of
the
wacs

she
paused
yes

had
heard
of
them
that
was
about
all
bill
i
ll
really
look
into
you
d
better
they
re

grand
outfit

she
said
to
bill
as
their
hands
clasped
in
farewell
in
the
army
i
shouldn
t
hot
diggity
that
s
the
stuff
he
gave
her
hand
a
big
squeeze
and
was
gone
and
now
i
m
here
bill
she
said
to
the
picture
on
the
wall
i
m
in
the
army
now
but
oh
bill
i
do
hope
our
companies
will
some
time
march
in
the
same
parade
after
an
hour
with
her
pictures
norma
felt
herself
ready
for
one
more
week
of
drilling
police
duty
study
and
all
that
went
on
from
dawn
till
dark
at
old
fort
des
moines
after
a
hearty
meal
eaten
in
a
big
bright
cafeteria
where
all
the
people
seemed
carefree
and
gay
she
stepped
out
to
see
the
lights
of
des
moines
at
night
thrills
she
had
experienced
more
than
once
came
to
her
from
exploring
a
strange
city
at
night
certainly
exploring
a
city
of
friendly
people
many
of
whom
smiled
at
her
in
a
kindly
way
as
she
marched
along
in
her
uniform
could
not
be
dangerous
for
an
hour
she
prowled
the
streets
alone
past
dark
public
buildings
that
loomed
at
her
from
the
night
down
narrow
dark
streets
where
taxi
drivers
and
workers
sat
or
stood
before
narrow
lunch
counters
she
wandered
and
then
back
to
the
broad
street
where
lights
were
bright
and
the
throngs
were
gay
a
feeling
of
utter
loneliness
drove
her
once
again
into
the
shadows
and
there
she
met
with
a
startling
adventure
chapter
vii
a
hand
in
the
dark
she
had
rounded
a
corner
and
was
walking
slowly
north
admiring
the
sight
of
the
moon
shining
over
the
jagged
line
of
rooftops
when
suddenly
two
figures
emerged
from
a
narrow
alley
to
turn
in
ahead
of
her
been
taking
a
short
cut
she
thought
the
steady
swinging
stride
of
the
taller
of
the
two
girls
as
they
marched
on
before
her
suggested
that
she
might
be
a
wac
but
she
s
wearing
civilian
clothes
she
told
herself
in
surprise
the
two
shadowy
figures
seemed
vaguely
familiar
because
of
this
she
followed
them
they
had
gone
two
blocks
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
taller
of
the
two
turned
her
head
half
about
the
moonlight
painted
her
features
in
sharp
outline
it
s
lena
she
whispered
lena
in
civilian
clothes
what
did
it
mean
had
this
girl
been
found
out
and
dismissed
from
the
service
as
if
the
question
had
been
put
directly
to
her
the
shorter
of
the
two
girls
paused
and
looked
back
just
in
time
norma
dodged
into
the
shadows
an
inaudible
gasp
escaped
her
lips
the
other
girl
was
the
one
from
the
beauty
parlor
at
the
fort
as
the
two
girls
resumed
their
march
norma
followed
them
without
thinking
too
much
about
the
reason
or
possible
consequence
at
the
next
corner
they
turned
west
on
a
dark
street
here
on
both
sides
were
auto
repair
shops
and
cheap
stores
scarcely
had
norma
rounded
this
corner
when
the
two
girls
swung
through
a
door
to
disappear
into
a
shop
that
was
almost
completely
dark
acting
purely
on
impulse
norma
caught
the
door
before
it
had
completely
closed
pushing
it
a
little
farther
open
she
slipped
inside
and
then
allowed
it
to
close
noiselessly
at
the
same
instant
a
thought
struck
her
all
in
a
heap
lena
had
a
perfect
right
to
dress
in
civilian
clothes
on
her
day
off
all
wacs
have
she
norma
had
chosen
to
wear
her
uniform
in
a
way
it
is
a
sort
of
protection
she
had
said
to
betty
yes
like
a
nun
s
cape
and
veil
betty
had
laughed
is
it
a
protection
norma
asked
herself
now
at
first
the
place
seemed
completely
dark
then
she
caught
a
gleam
of
light
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
she
began
hearing
low
voices
the
two
girls
were
back
there
someone
was
with
them
what
a
goose
i
am
norma
thought
lena
has
a
right
to
dress
as
she
pleases
nothing
unusual
has
happened
that
other
girl
probably
has
a
friend
who
works
here
they
have
come
here
to
meet
him
i
ll
just
slip
out
of
the
but
she
couldn
t
not
just
yet
the
door
was
closed
and
locked
just
a
little
frightened
she
felt
for
some
sort
of
bolt
or
spring
lock
that
could
be
released
there
was
none
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
seized
with
a
feeling
very
near
to
panic
she
wanted
to
dash
to
the
heavily
shaded
windows
and
pound
on
them
for
help
she
wanted
to
scream
and
yet
she
did
not
dare
perhaps
those
people
did
not
know
she
was
there
and
after
all
why
should
i
be
afraid
she
asked
herself
this
is
some
sort
of
a
repair
that
faint
light
from
the
back
brought
out
the
looming
bulks
of
cars
and
trucks
there
s
no
law
against
going
into
a
repair
shop
even
at
all
of
a
sudden
she
realized
that
it
was
not
fear
of
those
who
enforce
the
law
that
inspired
her
with
fear
but
those
who
hated
the
law
spies
she
whispered
softly
but
were
there
spies
in
this
city
perhaps
who
could
tell
spies
were
everywhere
once
again
she
tried
the
latch
lifting
it
up
and
down
pulling
at
the
door
without
a
sound
it
was
no
use
some
mysterious
type
of
lock
held
the
door
fast
shut
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
smaller
door
she
began
gliding
along
the
wall
all
at
once
she
bumped
into
something
that
toppled
over
to
fall
with
a
loud
bang
like
a
wild
bird
in
a
cage
she
flew
to
the
door
to
try
the
latch
with
all
her
strength
who
s
there
came
in
a
hoarse
voice
she
neither
moved
nor
spoke
a
minute
was
it
an
hour
her
heart
was
beating
painfully
she
had
the
sense
of
someone
approaching
yet
she
neither
heard
nor
saw
a
moving
thing
then
suddenly
she
did
see
groping
hand
the
flash
of
light
cutting
through
a
spot
beside
a
windowshade
revealed
it
a
scream
was
on
her
lips
and
yet
she
did
not
scream
and
then
the
hand
gripped
her
arm
what
are
you
doing
here
a
voice
growled
she
tried
to
speak
but
no
words
came
oh
you
are
one
of
the
voice
changed
suddenly
now
it
was
low
apologetic
you
are
one
of
them
lady
soldiers
a
wac
they
call
them
don
t
they
yes
yes
that
s
what
i
she
formed
the
words
but
could
not
say
them
there
was
no
need
for
the
man
went
on
you
were
perhaps
looking
for
the
wac
garage
it
is
not
here
that
is
another
place
you
came
door
locked
itself
is
it
not
so
yes
yes
that
is
it
she
whispered
lena
must
not
hear
her
voice
or
see
her
face
i
shall
unlock
the
door
this
is
all
too
bad
said
the
man
who
had
gripped
her
arm
by
some
magic
the
door
was
opened
and
she
stepped
out
into
the
night
the
light
of
a
car
illuminated
the
man
s
face
for
a
second
then
the
door
slammed
shut
i
ll
know
that
face
if
i
see
it
again
she
told
herself
she
wondered
if
after
all
lena
had
seen
if
she
had
what
then
ten
minutes
later
panting
a
little
she
entered
the
hotel
called
for
her
key
then
dashed
up
two
flights
of
stairs
to
her
room
having
locked
and
bolted
the
door
she
sank
into
the
chair
before
her
array
of
pictures
oh
bill
she
whispered
i
wish
i
hadn
t
she
was
thinking
not
alone
of
des
moines
but
fort
des
moines
the
army
and
all
the
rest
she
was
wishing
desperately
that
she
might
be
back
with
her
dad
and
her
dog
spark
after
that
she
sat
looking
at
her
father
s
picture
from
his
square
shoulders
and
his
twinkling
gray
eyes
she
drew
strength
she
seemed
to
feel
again
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
as
he
said
in
his
slow
calm
voice
you
re
the
only
boy
i
ve
got
thank
god
they
re
giving
you
a
chance
i
know
you
ll
do
your
duty
as
a
good
no
she
whispered
i
m
not
sorry
i
m
one
thing
she
decided
before
she
fell
asleep
in
that
big
comfortable
bed
this
was
that
she
would
cease
playing
the
part
of
an
agent
and
start
being
a
real
wac
i
ll
put
this
lena
business
out
of
my
life
she
whispered
this
is
the
end
of
it
forever
and
did
some
sprite
whisper
oh
no
sister
no
you
won
t
if
so
it
was
all
lost
on
her
for
she
had
fallen
fast
asleep
but
if
there
was
a
sprite
hovering
about
and
he
did
say
that
he
would
have
spoken
the
truth
there
are
some
things
that
just
won
t
be
put
out
of
our
lives
when
she
awoke
the
sun
was
shining
in
her
window
it
was
sunday
morning
but
she
was
not
thinking
of
that
instead
a
question
had
popped
into
her
head
how
had
that
man
known
she
was
a
wac
he
had
not
seen
her
the
place
had
been
completely
dark
there
could
be
but
one
the
sense
of
feeling
he
had
gripped
her
arm
he
had
recognized
the
feel
of
her
soft
wool
wac
uniform
and
how
had
he
come
to
know
the
feel
of
fine
wool
here
too
there
could
be
but
one
it
was
strange
on
the
following
monday
norma
was
asked
to
take
charge
of
the
drilling
of
her
company
i
realize
that
this
is
an
unusual
request
the
officer
in
charge
said
soberly
but
this
is
an
unusual
war
and
ours
an
unusual
organization
for
that
reason
we
must
perform
unusual
tasks
we
are
short
of
officers
the
army
camps
are
constantly
calling
for
more
and
more
of
our
workers
they
go
out
in
small
groups
an
officer
goes
with
each
group
so
now
you
see
how
it
she
smiled
what
do
you
say
ll
try
norma
agreed
she
undertook
the
task
with
fear
and
trembling
it
was
not
so
much
that
she
distrusted
her
own
ability
she
had
been
well
trained
but
how
would
the
other
girls
take
it
some
of
them
are
thirty
years
old
one
is
a
grandmother
she
said
to
betty
as
she
broke
the
news
and
i
am
barely
old
enough
to
it
s
not
age
that
counts
betty
replied
in
a
tone
that
carried
conviction
it
s
ability
and
experience
go
in
there
old
pal
and
win
this
is
war
we
all
must
do
our
best
and
you
can
bet
i
ll
be
right
in
there
rooting
for
oh
thanks
norma
replied
huskily
all
the
same
when
the
time
came
for
her
first
order
company
attention
her
throat
was
dry
and
her
heart
was
in
her
mouth
there
was
a
surprised
look
on
many
faces
as
they
turned
about
to
line
up
there
was
a
smile
or
two
but
they
were
not
unkind
smiles
then
a
thing
happened
that
broke
the
tension
an
officer
of
the
old
school
her
father
had
drilled
her
in
an
unusual
way
when
as
a
child
she
stood
at
attention
he
would
call
hup
two
now
in
her
excitement
she
called
to
her
company
hup
two
three
then
suddenly
realizing
what
she
had
done
she
laughed
and
they
all
laughed
with
her
the
ice
was
broken
mark
time
one
two
one
two
feet
came
down
with
an
even
on
the
frozen
path
the
march
was
on
oddly
enough
at
the
first
rest
period
one
of
the
older
members
said
why
not
hup
two
three
for
us
sure
that
s
the
way
the
soldiers
get
it
and
we
re
in
the
army
they
ll
call
us
the
hup
company
someone
laughed
that
will
be
swell
exclaimed
another
and
that
s
what
we
ll
be
the
hup
an
comin
company
and
so
it
came
to
be
for
two
hours
norma
put
them
through
their
paces
only
once
did
her
attention
waver
that
was
when
lena
gave
her
a
long
searching
look
she
knows
about
that
night
she
told
herself
and
all
but
lost
a
step
when
at
last
the
tired
marchers
were
once
more
on
their
own
many
of
the
girls
came
forward
to
congratulate
her
and
tell
her
how
well
she
had
done
they
are
won
over
just
wonderful
tears
of
gratitude
stood
in
norma
s
eyes
as
she
reported
to
her
superior
these
came
here
for
just
one
purpose
the
lieutenant
said
to
help
win
the
yes
that
s
it
to
hasten
the
end
of
this
terrible
affair
and
to
help
bring
their
brothers
sweethearts
and
friends
back
home
again
so
how
could
they
fail
to
do
their
best
or
refuse
to
respond
to
the
orders
of
any
leader
but
you
my
child
placed
a
hand
on
norma
s
you
have
real
officer
s
blood
coursing
through
your
norma
thanked
her
then
marched
away
she
spoke
wiser
than
she
knew
norma
thought
with
a
smile
she
had
not
told
her
that
her
father
had
been
an
officer
in
the
other
world
war
but
did
she
really
want
to
become
an
officer
of
the
wacs
she
did
not
know
after
that
the
days
glided
by
drill
was
not
all
there
was
to
their
training
far
from
that
the
articles
of
war
were
read
to
them
they
studied
long
hours
learning
what
it
meant
to
be
a
soldier
they
studied
military
regulations
they
took
gas
mask
drill
first
aid
and
a
score
of
other
activities
that
were
likely
to
fall
to
the
lot
of
any
wac
from
time
to
time
each
girl
was
assigned
to
potatoes
washing
dishes
scrubbing
floors
dishing
up
food
betty
who
was
a
real
student
hated
this
for
on
that
day
they
were
excused
from
study
but
millie
who
found
study
difficult
wished
that
came
five
times
a
week
though
norma
had
sworn
that
the
spy
complex
should
not
tempt
her
again
strange
things
happened
and
always
her
mind
would
ask
why
why
there
was
the
time
she
went
with
the
little
italian
girl
rosa
to
visit
the
airport
on
their
day
off
then
too
betty
more
than
once
tempted
her
to
start
spy
hunting
all
over
again
i
won
t
she
told
herself
i
won
t
i
just
won
t
positive
as
she
was
at
the
time
norma
did
not
succeed
long
in
keeping
this
resolution
it
was
really
rosa
s
strange
and
mysterious
adventure
at
the
airport
that
got
her
going
all
over
again
chapter
viii
rosa
almost
flies
on
the
saturday
that
norma
and
rosa
went
to
visit
the
airfield
they
doffed
their
uniforms
and
put
on
their
civies
all
the
same
norma
said
we
ll
take
along
our
identification
cards
just
in
airplanes
especially
those
flown
by
the
army
air
forces
had
always
interested
norma
so
she
was
more
than
delighted
when
shortly
after
their
arrival
at
the
field
a
flight
of
small
sleek
fighter
planes
came
winging
in
out
of
the
blue
look
rosa
norma
exclaimed
aren
t
they
wonderful
like
a
flock
of
beautiful
white
pigeons
there
was
no
need
to
say
look
to
the
little
italian
wac
as
if
in
a
hypnotic
trance
she
stood
with
eyes
glued
on
the
flight
of
planes
see
how
they
circle
norma
herself
was
entranced
this
is
like
war
this
is
how
they
will
come
sweeping
in
after
escorting
a
bomber
squadron
in
africa
or
china
or
who
knows
where
that
s
the
way
they
ll
look
when
we
watch
them
beyond
the
yes
this
is
war
was
all
that
rosa
said
as
one
by
one
the
fighting
planes
taxied
across
the
field
into
position
like
a
troop
of
boys
the
fliers
came
walking
across
the
field
bill
is
in
flight
training
right
now
norma
said
all
excited
if
only
he
were
in
that
group
who
s
bill
rosa
s
eyes
left
the
planes
for
an
instant
oh
he
s
just
norma
laughed
but
he
s
not
always
interested
in
any
person
in
uniform
norma
moved
closer
to
the
joking
laughing
group
how
young
they
seem
she
said
half
aloud
it
shocked
her
to
think
that
some
day
perhaps
not
too
far
away
from
the
blue
sky
shot
out
of
his
plane
bill
would
come
hurtling
down
tumbling
over
and
over
like
a
stick
thrown
into
the
air
crashing
at
last
to
earth
this
is
war
she
thought
with
a
shudder
we
wacs
must
do
all
in
our
power
to
make
it
end
and
we
will
now
we
are
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
next
it
will
be
three
hundred
a
million
wacs
marching
away
to
win
the
looking
up
she
allowed
her
eyes
to
sweep
the
field
it
was
an
inspiring
men
the
planes
the
flag
floating
in
the
breeze
oh
she
whispered
oh
how
i
wish
dad
were
young
again
and
then
with
a
sudden
start
she
realized
that
rosa
was
gone
from
her
side
she
s
vanished
she
thought
with
a
sudden
sense
of
panic
as
her
eyes
sought
the
girl
in
vain
just
then
as
if
moving
of
its
own
will
one
of
the
fighter
planes
began
gliding
toward
the
center
of
the
field
at
once
the
quiet
scene
became
one
of
action
a
young
pilot
close
to
the
plane
made
a
running
jump
to
grab
the
tail
of
the
plane
he
had
just
reached
it
when
in
the
midst
of
shouting
and
sound
of
rushing
feet
the
plane
s
motor
went
silent
and
the
plane
itself
came
to
a
sudden
stop
norma
was
thunderstruck
when
from
the
pilot
s
seat
of
that
plane
none
other
than
her
companion
rosa
the
little
italian
wac
was
dragged
out
rosa
rosa
you
little
dunce
why
did
you
do
it
she
screamed
as
she
raced
forward
by
the
time
she
reached
the
side
of
the
plane
rosa
was
on
the
ground
a
stalwart
member
of
the
military
police
had
her
by
the
arm
and
was
saying
come
along
sister
what
s
wrong
with
you
drunk
or
just
plain
nothin
at
all
it
s
the
guardhouse
for
her
a
second
predicted
loudly
realizing
that
for
the
moment
nothing
could
be
accomplished
norma
joined
three
grinning
young
pilots
as
they
followed
the
s
and
rosa
across
the
field
what
s
the
matter
with
that
girl
one
of
the
pilots
asked
in
a
friendly
tone
i
don
t
know
was
all
norma
could
say
she
was
with
you
wasn
t
she
a
second
pilot
asked
norma
made
no
reply

really
had
that
plane
going

the
first
pilot
one
minute
more
and
she
d

been
right
up
in
the
and
there

secrets
in
those
planes
that
nobody
but
us
are
supposed
to
know

in
number
three
by
george

s
a
spy

said
norma
she
s
no
more
a
spy
than

she
s
a
a
wac
the
first
pilot
exclaimed
well

too
sure
i
am
norma
agreed
well
all
i
got
to
say
is
you
d
look
swell
in
any
uniform
was
the
final
rejoinder
just
then
the
flight
commander
a
very
major
who
had
come
across
the
field
in
long
strides
caught
up
with
the
procession
caught
this
girl
trying
to
steal

of
your
planes

an
yes

one
of
the
pilots
as
norma
and
the
still
silently
weeping

hurried
off
the
field
once
she
was
safe
on
the
streetcar
and
headed
for
the
city
rosa
ceased
her
weeping
but
every
now
and
again
norma
heard
her
whisper
why
did
i
do
it
oh
why
what
was
back
of
all
this
hidden
away
in
the
little
italian
girl
s
mind
were
secrets
norma
would
never
be
able
to
doubt
that
from
this
day
on
i
d
like
to
go
exploring
in
that
mind
of
yours
she
thought
that
this
type
of
exploring
often
leads
to
disaster
she
knew
all
too
well
so
for
the
time
being
she
did
not
explore
arrived
at
the
city
norma
at
once
sought
out
a
restaurant
with
a
little
nook
in
the
wall
where
lights
were
subdued
and
where
delicious
foods
were
served
by
the
time
they
had
gone
all
the
way
from
soup
to
ice
cream
and
were
sipping
good
strong
black
tea
the
little
italian
girl
s
eyes
were
shining
once
again
was
that
after
all
so
terrible
she
asked
of
course
it
was
norma
replied
instantly
the
question
surprised
and
shocked
her
i
did
no
harm
to
the
you
might
have
killed
someone
wrecked
the
plane
or
even
flown
away
in
oh
no
for
a
space
of
seconds
it
seemed
that
rosa
was
on
the
verge
of
revealing
some
important
secret
i
didn
t
do
any
of
those
terrible
things
she
ended
lamely
the
secret
must
wait
norma
told
herself
to
rosa
she
said
there
were
secrets
in
that
i
didn
t
want
their
secrets
rosa
s
cheeks
flushed
how
could
they
know
that
norma
was
a
little
provoked
illustration
you
might
have
wrecked
the
plane
norma
i
m
a
wac
when
they
knew
that
they
saw
it
was
all
it
was
i
who
got
you
norma
s
voice
rose
they
thought
you
were
a
i
a
spy
rosa
stared
yes
that
is
what
they
said
but
they
were
they
were
not
norma
was
in
dead
earnest
but
i
m
a
wac
how
can
a
wac
be
a
spy
my
record
it
was
checked
my
yes
i
know
all
that
but
even
in
a
wac
uniform
you
might
be
a
spy
my
father
told
me
once
that
during
the
world
war
many
spies
in
france
wore
uniforms
they
were
very
hard
to
catch
believe
me
the
mata
haris
of
this
war
will
be
wearing
wac
uniforms
too
we
have
to
be
careful
very
very
norma
settled
back
in
her
place
to
study
the
italian
girl
s
face
it
was
indeed
an
interesting
moving
picture
of
lights
and
shadows
but
from
it
norma
learned
little
twice
rosa
seemed
on
the
point
of
replying
but
in
the
end
no
words
were
spoken
by
this
time
their
group
though
still
together
had
moved
to
newer
and
more
comfortable
quarters
in
boom
town
that
night
norma
lay
staring
at
the
darkness
for
a
long
time
before
she
fell
asleep
she
was
thinking
of
rosa
and
lena
rosa
s
actions
on
that
day
had
started
her
thinking
things
all
over
again
and
her
thoughts
were
long
long
thoughts
once
again
she
caught
the
gleam
of
light
from
rosa
s
cot
and
saw
lena
sit
up
in
her
place
at
night
as
she
whispered
three
mysterious
words
the
picture
of
lena
and
the
spanish
hairdresser
standing
in
the
moonlight
again
fascinated
her
and
once
more
she
felt
that
terrifying
grip
on
her
arm
as
a
man
s
voice
said
oh
you
are
one
of
them
a
chapter
or
two
had
been
added
to
lena
s
story
betty
was
responsible
for
this
one
night
she
had
come
in
rather
late
but
had
remained
up
long
enough
to
whisper
to
norma
who
do
you
think
i
saw
tonight
down
by
the
big
gate
lena
and
the
spanish
hairdresser
is
that
so
strange
norma
had
tried
to
seem
indifferent
but
there
was
a
man
with
betty
s
whisper
rose
he
had
a
small
mustache
that
turned
up
and
sort
of
staring
did
he
norma
s
voice
betrayed
her
excitement
yes
and
he
said
to
lena
you
must
only
his
you
sounded
like
du
and
lena
has
her
hair
done
every
other
day
by
the
spanish
hairdresser
that
costs
money
do
you
think
she
always
pays
so
betty
too
had
a
spy
complex
well
let
her
have
it
she
wasn
t
going
to
be
drawn
into
it
for
all
that
some
things
did
seem
very
strange
at
that
norma
turned
over
and
fell
asleep
chapter
ix
something
special
the
period
of
their
basic
training
at
old
fort
des
moines
was
drawing
to
a
close
three
more
days
and
they
would
be
scattered
far
and
wide
some
it
is
true
would
remain
for
further
training
in
the
motor
transport
school
and
cooks
and
bakers
school
some
would
take
up
officers
training
but
out
of
the
thousand
who
had
been
in
training
for
nearly
four
weeks
the
greater
number
would
be
scattered
to
the
four
winds
just
think
betty
sighed
as
she
and
norma
stepped
out
into
a
glorious
springlike
morning
to
leave
this
lovely
place
for
some
army
camp
but
that
s
why
we
came
here
norma
protested
i
m
eager
to
start
doing
some
real
yes
and
you
re
just
the
one
who
is
most
likely
to
be
kept
here
to
enter
officers
there
was
admiration
in
betty
s
voice
and
a
suggestion
of
envy
lucky
girl
to
have
such
a
grand
then
norma
made
a
strange
remark
i
m
not
sure
that
i
want
to
be
an
least
not
don
t
be
silly
betty
exploded
who
wouldn
t
like
to
be
an
officer
when
you
arrive
at
your
army
camp
you
re
right
up
there
with
the
rest
of
the
bill
s
a
buck
private
and
he
s
good
enough
for
me
come
on
let
s
get
our
morning
coffee
this
is
the
day
of
the
big
yes
this
was
the
day
and
such
a
glorious
day
for
weeks
it
had
been
too
cold
for
a
parade
snow
had
lain
on
the
parade
ground
but
now
the
snow
was
gone
the
ground
was
frozen
but
the
sun
was
bright
six
thousand
women
norma
thought
as
a
thrill
ran
up
her
spine
then
suddenly
her
heart
skipped
a
beat
she
was
to
lead
her
own
company
she
was
the
only
basic
on
whom
such
an
honor
had
been
conferred
she
would
do
her
best
would
it
be
good
enough
then
there
was
that
very
special
thing
she
shuddered
afresh
and
that
morning
for
the
first
time
she
dropped
her
big
handleless
cup
with
a
bang
and
a
splash
on
the
table
nerves
suggested
betty
a
bad
norma
frowned
no
a
good
one
betty
countered
shows
you
re
sweating
them
out
right
now
you
ll
be
cool
as
a
cucumber
when
the
time
at
that
afternoon
they
assembled
on
the
parade
grounds
slowly
they
formed
into
companies
and
took
their
places
in
line
since
this
was
to
be
a
gala
occasion
a
military
band
from
an
army
post
had
been
imported
each
company
had
its
flag
and
its
leader
norma
thrilled
to
her
finger
tips
as
she
stepped
out
before
her
hup
two
three
company
if
only
dad
were
here
she
thought
why
oh
why
didn
t
i
ask
him
to
come
by
the
time
they
were
all
in
their
places
the
reviewing
stand
was
all
aglitter
with
officers
insignia
and
decorations
a
hush
fell
over
the
ancient
parade
ground
as
the
band
struck
up
they
stood
at
rigid
attention
when
this
was
over
norma
glanced
hastily
over
her
company
it
was
perfect
never
she
was
sure
had
there
been
such
a
group
of
girls
suddenly
the
band
struck
up
sousa
s
stirring
march
stars
and
stripes
and
the
parade
began
to
norma
it
was
all
a
glorious
dream
the
flags
the
music
the
bright
sunshine
great
young
and
dashing
some
subdued
and
grave
standing
in
review
but
this
is
only
the
beginning
she
told
herself
there
is
this
was
true
for
once
as
she
drilled
her
own
company
at
dusk
on
the
ancient
grounds
having
chosen
a
dark
corner
they
had
put
on
something
very
special
it
had
been
great
fun
and
gave
them
a
thrill
as
well
they
had
however
made
one
red
brick
officer
s
home
facing
that
corner
of
the
parade
ground
was
occupied
by
the
commanding
officer
hearing
the
rattle
of
drums
she
had
slipped
on
her
fur
coat
and
had
stepped
out
on
the
veranda
thrilled
and
charmed
as
she
expressed
it
by
their
performance
she
had
come
down
off
the
porch
to
congratulate
their
officer
when
she
found
a
private
at
their
head
she
was
amazed
for
norma
was
putting
her
company
through
an
intricate
drill
my
dear
it
is
marvelous
she
enthused
when
it
was
over
and
this
of
yours
is
charming
let
us
keep
it
a
secret
shall
we
until
the
day
of
the
parade
you
norma
stared
your
company
shall
do
this
as
something
extra
after
the
parade
is
norma
gulped
as
she
recalled
the
stirring
words
without
a
word
she
saluted
the
commanding
officer
and
that
was
why
a
chill
sometimes
ran
up
her
spine
as
the
grand
little
army
of
wacs
swept
down
the
field
that
certain
something
extra
was
yet
to
come
the
parade
with
its
marches
and
counter
marches
in
close
formation
and
open
formation
following
the
band
down
the
long
field
and
back
again
was
an
inspiring
sight
there
were
those
there
that
day
who
realized
as
never
before
what
war
could
do
to
a
nation
and
her
people
since
it
had
been
announced
by
megaphone
that
an
extra
feature
would
follow
the
grand
parade
the
wacs
once
their
formation
was
broken
joined
the
onlookers
at
the
side
all
but
norma
and
her
company
these
hastened
to
one
of
the
barracks
marching
in
close
formation
they
were
soon
back
on
the
field
however
three
of
their
members
had
undergone
a
speedy
transformation
or
were
they
members
of
the
company
at
all
the
spectators
were
unable
to
tell
leading
the
trio
was
what
appeared
to
be
a
tall
gray
haired
man
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
drum
behind
him
marched
a
mannish
figure
carrying
a
fife
and
after
him
came
a
boy
also
with
a
drum
hatless
the
man
with
the
fife
wearing
a
bandage
on
his
head
and
the
other
two
lined
up
behind
their
leader
norma
and
behind
them
marched
the
company
suddenly
at
a
signal
from
norma
the
trio
snapped
to
attention
instantly
the
roll
of
drums
and
the
shrill
whistle
of
a
fife
greeted
the
listeners
ears
then
electrified
the
audience
knew
the
three
figures
represented
a
picture
they
had
known
from
childhood
spirit
of
led
by
these
three
the
khaki
host
marched
with
perfect
rhythm
halfway
down
the
field
and
back
again
an
awed
silence
followed
then
rose
such
a
cheer
as
the
ancient
barracks
had
seldom
echoed
back
even
in
the
old
indian
days
but
overcome
by
her
sudden
triumph
norma
tried
to
hide
among
her
now
broken
ranks
but
all
in
vain
she
was
searched
out
and
led
to
the
grandstand
the
first
person
she
met
was
a
man
with
one
empty
sleeve
dad
she
cried
soon
she
was
being
greeted
by
officers
and
other
honored
guests
i
shall
recommend
you
for
officers
training
the
commanding
officer
whispered
in
her
ear
oh
but
i
m
not
sure
that
i
want
to
be
an
officer
the
cry
escaped
unbidden
from
norma
s
lips
we
shall
see
was
the
reply
lieutenant
warren
her
beloved
lieutenant
who
was
standing
near
said
i
would
like
to
have
you
and
your
father
at
my
house
for
dinner
tonight
you
know
my
house
norma
nodded
will
you
come
norma
looked
into
her
father
s
eyes
then
she
said
yes
thank
you
that
will
be
as
she
stepped
from
the
platform
norma
felt
that
she
had
lived
a
whole
week
in
one
short
hour
but
her
day
was
not
half
done
chapter
x
i
m
afraid
oddly
enough
when
norma
had
conceived
the
idea
of
depicting
spirit
of
and
had
gone
about
the
task
of
selecting
her
fife
player
and
drummers
she
had
discovered
that
in
all
the
company
there
were
but
two
drummers
rosa
and
lena
at
first
she
hesitated
to
ask
lena
to
play
the
part
for
to
say
the
least
their
relations
had
been
none
too
cordial
in
the
end
she
had
swallowed
her
pride
and
made
the
request
oh
sure
lena
had
agreed
i
think
it
will
be
loads
of
fun
in
the
end
with
her
long
legs
encased
in
stockings
and
short
breeches
and
with
a
white
wig
she
had
played
the
part
of
a
revolutionary
grandfather
superbly
as
for
rosa
she
had
been
every
inch
a
boy
a
girl
named
mary
played
the
fife
and
so
it
happened
that
it
was
in
the
company
of
lena
rosa
betty
and
millie
that
shortly
after
the
breakup
of
the
parade
norma
found
herself
tramping
toward
the
main
chapel
her
father
had
been
taken
on
an
inspection
of
the
grounds
the
company
in
which
these
girls
at
last
found
themselves
was
a
thousand
strong
these
girls
had
all
completed
their
training
and
in
two
or
three
more
days
would
scatter
north
south
east
and
west
to
take
up
the
tasks
for
which
they
had
been
trained
it
s
going
to
be
swell
lena
exclaimed
we
re
headed
for
the
coast
the
coast
norma
stared
how
do
you
know
haven
t
you
been
told
millie
exclaimed
we
ve
all
been
told
we
re
to
be
part
of
an
interceptor
planes
that
are
coming
to
bomb
or
spies
that
try
to
land
from
submarines
rosa
exclaimed

will
be
thrilling
and
dangerous
i
only
thing

millie
pouted
i
m
afraid
there
won
t
be
many
soldiers
soldiers
norma
stared
at
her
well
you
do
like
a
date
now
and
then
millie
drawled
you
get
awfully
lonesome
when
you
don
at
that
they
all
laughed
honest
haven
t
you
been
told
betty
asked
when
she
had
norma
by
herself
not

was
the
slow
reply
oh

exclaimed
they
re
going
to
send
you
to
officers
training
school
some
people
have
all
the
luck
do
they
norma
said
truth
was
she
was
tired
the
thousand
wacs
now
streaming
into
the
chapel
were
being
assembled
for
a
final
word
from
the
officers
of
the
camp
before
they
went
out
to
their
work
where
do
you
suppose
we
ll
be
sent
norma
heard
one
girl
ask
as
she
took
her
seat
perhaps
north
africa
someone
whispered
surely
not
just
like
that
was
the
surprised
reply
a
lot
of
wacs
landed
there
just
last
sunday
i
saw
it
in
the
paper
and
did
they
have
thrills
going
over
heard
the
siren
telling
of
prowling
subs
felt
the
thud
of
depth
bombs
shish
the
girl
s
friend
whispered
you
re
almost
shouting
all
the
same
they
had
a
grand
time
danced
with
soldiers
on
deck
and
all
that
right
over
there
in
africa
now
girls
tell
me
how
i
can
get
to
go
then
all
at
once
the
throng
was
silent
the
ranking
officers
were
mounting
the
platform
in
a
silent
salute
the
girls
all
rose
when
the
lieutenant
colonel
in
charge
of
the
post
the
commanding
officer
and
two
officers
norma
did
not
at
once
recognize
were
seated
they
all
sat
down
the
lieutenant
colonel
rose
fellow
soldiers
of
america
she
began
norma
was
thrilled
you
have
assembled
here
in
order
that
we
may
give
you
a
final
greeting
and
farewell
during
your
four
weeks
of

to
you
for
service
faithfulness
to
your
task
and
loyalty

know
you
will
not
we
will
not
fail
came
in
an
inaudible
whisper
had
one
woman
or
a
hundred
said
it
no
one
knew
it
was
enough
that
an
electric
thrill
passed
over
the
room
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
the
colonel
went
on
it
has
been
customary
for
the
commanding
officer
or
myself
to
give
you
a
brief
talk
in
an
effort
to
acquaint
you
with
that
which
lies
ahead
this
afternoon
we
have
delegated
that
task
to
one
who
not
so
many
months
ago

through
her
baptism
of
fire
in
flanders

be
so
kind
as
to
tell
these
young
women
what
it
really
means
to
be
a
wac
as
lieutenant
warren
rose
the
colonel
said
some
of
you
know
lieutenant
warren
to
those
of
you
who
do
not
know
her
may
i
say
that
during
the
fall
of
holland
belgium
and
france
miss
warren
drove
an
ann
morgan
ambulance
evacuating
old
men
women
and
children
from
those
unfortunate
lands
and
that
the
medal
pinned
upon
her
breast
is
a
croix
de
guerre
presented
to
her
by
a
grateful
there
was
a
rustle
in
the
audience
someone
sprang
to
her
feet
instantly
they
were
all
on
their
feet
in
silent
tribute
to
a
member
of
their
own
ranks
who
had
seen
service
on
the
bloody
fields
of
france
my
lieutenant
norma
whispered
chokingly
at
that
instant
she
knew
that
she
would
gladly
follow
this
leader
round
the
world
tonight
she
thought
as
she
sank
again
into
her
seat
father
and
i
are
to
dine
with
her
what
a
privilege
she
wondered
what
would
be
said
at
that
dinner
and
then
the
speech
began
lieutenant
warren
spoke
slowly
distinctly
norma
caught
every
word
and
yet
her
voice
never
rose
to
a
high
pitch
she
spoke
at
length
of
what
she
had
seen
little
of
what
she
had
done
speaking
of
the
enemy
planes
she
said
they
swooped
low
over
roads
that
were
crowded
with
carts
drawn
by
horses
or
weary
old
men
and
carts
pushed
by
women
and
children
these
people
were
refugees
driven
from
their
homes
they
were
trying
to
save
a
little
of
that
which
they
had
once
owned
for
they
had
always
been
poor
but
those
enemy
pilots
there
was
biting
anger
in
her
low
voice
they
came
swooping
down
to
shower
bullets
upon
these
defenseless
people
what
did
they
want
to
clog
the
road
with
helpless
and
innocent
women
and
children
so
their
armies
might
more
easily
destroy
the
defeated
as
the
speaker
paused
for
breath
norma
stole
a
glance
at
her
companions
millie
and
rosa
were
leaning
forward
lips
parted
eyes
wide
drinking
in
every
word
betty
sat
well
back
in
her
seat
listening
as
one
listens
who
has
heard
many
rare
speeches
yet
there
was
on
her
face
a
look
that
said
this
is
real
though
it
is
terrible
i
shall
not
forget
but
lena
norma
was
startled
there
was
on
her
face
a
look
as
cold
as
marble
without
knowing
why
at
sight
of
that
face
norma
suddenly
felt
terribly
afraid
this
mood
passed
quickly
for
again
lieutenant
warren
was
speaking
we
worked
hour
after
hour
day
after
day
without
sleep
on
our
ambulances
we
carried
men
whose
legs
had
been
shot
away
mothers
whose
children
had
perished
children
who
had
lost
their
mothers
forever
and
babies
in
cribs
in
her
voice
broke
then
standing
tall
and
straight
with
the
medal
gleaming
on
her
breast
she
said
hate
terrible
hate
did
all
this
it
is
for
you
and
me
to
take
the
places
of
brave
young
men
who
are
eager
to
help
put
down
this
terrible
enemy
and
to
silence
their
machine
guns
forever
are
we
going
to
do
it
instantly
there
came
a
cry
that
was
like
the
roar
of
the
sea
yes
yes
yes
but
norma
stole
a
look
at
lena
s
face
then
as
if
afraid
she
might
leave
a
picture
too
terrible
for
all
these
young
minds
lieutenant
warren
went
back
to
the
days
before
the
defeat
of
france
she
painted
pictures
of
friendly
villages
in
france
the
grocer
the
baker
the
aged
shoemaker
and
all
the
little
were
all
there
these
she
went
on
quietly
are
the
people
we
are
fighting
good
kindly
simple
common
people
in
france
belgium
the
netherlands
in
over
europe
they
are
starving
slaves
today
we
are
fighting
that
they
may
be
made
free
and
that
our
own
people
shall
never
be
then
she
told
of
those
good
brave
days
in
unoccupied
france
when
a
great
general
had
pinned
the
de
on
her
blouse
and
all
the
good
people
had
wept
all
in
all
norma
thought
it
the
grandest
speech
she
had
ever
heard
once
again
as
the
speaker
resumed
her
seat
the
audience
rose
to
its
feet
in
a
silent
ovation
then
someone
swept
her
hands
softly
over
the
organ
keys
and
they
sang
as
they
had
never
sung
it
before
oh
say
can
you
see
as
the
last
note
died
away
norma
stole
a
look
at
lena
s
face
it
was
cold
gray
and
hard
as
steel
she
had
not
been
singing
when
at
last
but
determined
norma
left
the
room
she
whispered
betty
i
m
afraid
why
betty
asked
i
don
t
afraid
that
s
chapter
xi
two
against
two
at
seven
that
evening
norma
found
herself
in
a
place
of
great
enchantment
since
her
father
was
with
her
the
fear
of
was
gone
and
joy
reigned
supreme
those
ancient
officers
homes
that
lined
one
side
of
the
parade
ground
had
always
intrigued
her
now
she
was
really
inside
one
of
them
and
it
was
indeed
charming
the
mantel
above
the
huge
fireplace
as
well
as
the
walls
on
all
sides
were
lined
with
fascinating
objects
of
art
which
she
realized
must
have
been
brought
by
her
hostess
from
france
yes
they
came
from
france
all
of
lieutenant
warren
indicated
a
small
group
of
photographs
these
there
was
a
change
in
her
voice
these
are
my
mother
my
sister
my
grandfather
they
are
from
yes
i
know
how
you
feel
about
norma
smiled
you
might
be
interested
to
know
what
i
did
on
my
first
weekend
that
is
always
interesting
replied
the
hostess
girls
are
so
norma
told
how
she
had
rented
a
hotel
room
and
had
put
up
all
her
pictures
in
her
eagerness
and
excitement
she
came
very
nearly
going
right
on
telling
of
her
mysterious
and
startling
experience
following
lena
and
being
trapped
in
a
repair
shop
at
night
just
in
time
she
caught
herself
these
things
are
important
the
lieutenant
replied
in
a
quiet
tone
don
t
let
those
feelings
escape
you
when
you
realize
to
the
full
what
home
and
loved
ones
mean
to
you
and
when
you
contrast
america
and
france
as
it
is
today
it
makes
you
want
to
fight
i
am
sure
of
that
norma
s
father
agreed
heartily
but
all
these
beautiful
pictures
these
tiny
statues
all
carved
in
marble
those
silver
candlesticks
these
etchings
norma
exclaimed
how
could
you
afford
them
these
my
dear
the
lieutenant
these
all
were
gifts
from
those
kindly
and
grateful
french
people
when
i
protested
they
said
but
yes
you
must
take
them
you
really
must
all
france
will
be
overrun
the
boche
will
get
them
a
thousand
times
better
that
you
have
there
are
names
on
all
of
them
she
added
see
pierre
jeanne
margot
when
this
terrible
war
is
over
many
of
them
shall
go
how
wonderful
norma
murmured
these
etchings
are
from
that
last
war
i
saw
them
in
paris
said
kent
they
are
wonderful
and
terrible
lieutenant
warren
murmured
one
etching
pictured
a
huge
cannon
belching
forth
hate
in
the
form
of
black
smoke
and
emerging
from
that
smoke
was
a
beautiful
woman
her
hands
had
been
turned
into
claws
and
on
her
face
was
a
look
of
unutterable
rage
and
yet
she
is
gorgeous
norma
whispered
the
second
etching
showed
a
valiant
french
pilot
falling
from
his
wrecked
and
burning
plane
down
to
certain
death
but
beneath
him
hands
locked
waiting
ready
to
catch
him
and
bear
him
away
were
two
beautiful
angels
yes
said
the
lieutenant
who
had
been
through
so
much
in
france
this
is
war
it
is
beautiful
and
it
is
this
is
war
the
man
agreed
and
he
really
knows
norma
thought
come
invited
the
hostess
dinner
is
about
to
be
there
were
busy
and
exciting
times
in
norma
kent
s
life
when
she
ate
a
meal
and
enjoyed
it
to
the
full
and
yet
two
hours
later
she
could
not
have
told
what
she
had
eaten
this
was
to
be
just
such
a
meal
the
food
was
delicious
the
silver
and
dishes
charming
but
the
conversation
absorbed
all
her
attention
little
wonder
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
whole
future
hung
in
the
balance
somewhere
between
soup
and
roast
chicken
lieutenant
warren
said
all
too
casually
did
i
hear
them
say
you
had
been
asked
to
enter
officers
training
you
may
have
heard
that
norma
flushed
it
has
been
suggested
by
a
lady
in
high
it
s
quite
an
honor
don
t
you
think
so
kent
the
lieutenant
turned
to
norma
s
father
yes
indeed
it
s
the
first
step
and
you
deserve
it
lieutenant
warren
said
with
a
bright
smile
we
re
proud
of
you
please
accept
my
congratulations
and
allow
me
to
wish
you
all
the
luck
in
the
wait
a
minute
norma
exclaimed
put
on
the
brakes
i
haven
t
said
i
would
her
father
gave
her
a
quick
look
the
smile
on
lieutenant
warren
s
face
appeared
to
light
up
a
little
as
she
said
do
you
mind
telling
me
why
you
said
that
not
a
bit
was
the
quick
response
it
s
because
i
want
to
come
up
the
hard
way
dad
she
said
that
s
how
you
climbed
up
in
that
other
a
rare
smile
spread
over
the
man
s
face
however
i
had
no
choice
with
me
it
was
that
way
or
not
at
all
the
same
norma
insisted
i
want
to
get
out
and
do
some
real
work
i
was
in
college
for
four
years
and
now
at
the
fort
for
a
month
what
i
want
to
know
is
can
i
really
do
any
worthwhile
work
good
exclaimed
lieutenant
warren
i
hoped
you
would
say
that
and
now
may
i
serve
you
some
of
this
chicken
while
it
is
hot
but
why
are
glad
norma
asked
in
a
puzzled
tone
after
the
chicken
had
been
served
because
i
am
leaving
here
in
two
days
and
i
want
to
take
you
with
going
where
norma
asked
in
surprise
to
the
coast
i
can
t
tell
you
the
exact
spot
because
i
don
t
happen
to
know
and
because
if
i
did
know
i
would
not
be
permitted
to
tell
it
will
be
somewhere
on
the
rugged
coast
of
new
england
rather
far
north
i
imagine
i
am
to
be
given
a
station
of
the
interceptor
control
interceptor
control
norma
exclaimed
those
words
charmed
me
from
the
first
they
somehow
seem
to
suggest
dark
night
patrols
intrigue
mystery
and
perhaps
real
perhaps
you
are
making
too
much
of
it
that
depends
lieutenant
warren
drew
a
deep
breath
be
that
as
it
may
i
m
in
for
it
and
i
am
to
select
a
squad
to
take
with
me
it
s
a
relatively
small
station
one
squad
will
be
enough
at
she
s
asked
my
squad
to
go
norma
thought
she
didn
t
ask
me
because
she
thought
i
might
want
to
take
a
step
up
join
the
officers
training
school
at
then
she
asked
a
question
on
impulse
are
you
planning
to
take
all
my
ten
of
them
i
had
hoped
to
if
you
cared
to
join
norma
caught
herself
she
had
been
about
to
betray
her
spy
complex
what
she
had
wanted
to
say
was
but
how
about
lena
it
is
for
you
to
choose
the
lieutenant
said
quietly
oh
i
want
to
go
norma
exclaimed
count
me
in
please
don
t
leave
me
out
there
it
was
again
only
what
only
nothing
please
forgive
me
norma
begged
and
so
it
was
settled
norma
was
to
be
given
a
leave
to
be
spent
at
home
with
her
father
then
she
was
to
meet
lieutenant
warren
and
the
squad
in
chicago
there
they
were
to
board
an
eastbound
train
for
fields
of
fresh
toil
and
adventure
norma
stirred
uneasily
in
her
place
by
the
car
window
she
was
on
her
been
for
some
time
two
or
three
hours
more
and
she
would
be
looking
at
the
place
she
and
her
fellow
wacs
would
call
home
for
some
time
i
should
be
thrilled
she
told
herself
but
i
m
half
scared
that
s
lena
and
rosa
were
together
five
seats
ahead
of
her
they
had
been
together
all
the
way
nothing
strange
about
that
really
they
had
shared
a
pullman
compartment
just
as
she
and
betty
had
all
the
same
it
disturbed
her
suddenly
she
made
a
great
would
tell
betty
all
about
it
betty
like
as
not
would
laugh
the
whole
thing
off
then
she
d
be
rid
of
the
spy
business
for
ever
betty
she
said
in
a
low
tone
there
is
something
i
want
to
tell
whole
lot
of
okay
said
betty
i
m
betty
do
you
remember
the
first
night
we
slept
in
that
stable
at
fort
des
moines
do
i
betty
laughed
first
time
i
ever
slept
on
a
cot
and
with
fifty
other
girls
that
was
one
nightmare
well
on
that
night
lena
sat
up
in
her
bed
and
whispered
gott
in
himmel
and
rosa
flashed
a
light
in
her
cot
where
no
light
is
supposed
to
show
that
got
me
going
how
betty
stared
i
thought
they
might
be
spies
nonsense
but
betty
paused
for
thought
i
did
see
lena
down
by
the
gate
once
she
was
talking
to
that
spanish
hairdresser
and
a
strange
man
who
said
du
must
there
have
been
whisperings
about
that
hairdresser
three
days
before
we
left
the
fort
she
betty
norma
exclaimed
softly
you
re
no
help
at
all
you
just
make
matters
how
what
do
you
mean
i
was
hoping
you
d
rid
me
of
my
spy
laugh
it
off
and
here
you
are
taking
the
thing
seriously
what
s
more
i
haven
t
told
you
a
thing
well
then
tell
me
the
rest
betty
invited
then
perhaps
we
ll
both
have
us
a
good
big
and
perhaps
we
won
t
norma
added
gloomily
but
all
right
here
she
leaned
over
close
talking
low
i
saw
rosa
s
light
three
times
one
night
i
asked
her
what
did
she
say
she
said
her
mother
had
asked
her
to
read
a
prayer
from
her
prayer
book
every
that
was
nice
betty
murmured
in
approval
yes
if
it
s
how
could
you
doubt
her
you
have
to
doubt
when
you
don
t
really
know
besides
how
about
this
we
went
out
to
visit
the
airfield
one
day
and
rosa
without
anyone
seeing
her
climbed
into
a
fighter
plane
and
started
across
the
field
with
she
did
betty
whispered
in
astonishment
norma
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
and
did
that
start
something
she
was
almost
arrested
you
see
they
were
trying
out
some
secret
devices
in
those
how
did
she
ever
explain
that
betty
was
filled
with
astonishment
she
never
explained
illustration
leaned
over
close
talking
just
left
it
in
the
air
i
thought
she
was
going
to
tell
me
later
but
then
she
appeared
to
change
her
mind
how
would
you
explain
it
norma
asked
there
was
an
eager
note
in
her
voice
she
really
wanted
it
explained
fascinated
by
airplanes
perhaps
was
the
slow
reply
some
people
are
that
way
climb
in
you
know
touch
something
here
another
there
and
away
they
go
children
often
do
that
with
a
but
rosa
s
not
a
child
we
ll
keep
an
eye
on
her
betty
said
after
a
moment
s
thought
we
ve
got
a
real
job
to
do
we
can
t
have
things
going
wrong
but
lena
she
suggested
she
never
did
anything
as
bad
as
that
did
she
perhaps
yes
and
perhaps
no
let
me
tell
you
then
you
be
the
norma
leaned
close
i
followed
lena
and
the
spanish
hairdresser
into
a
place
as
dark
as
a
stack
of
black
you
didn
t
i
certainly
then
what
happened
the
door
silently
locked
betty
caught
her
breath
what
chances
you
take
i
just
sort
of
walked
into
that
norma
sighed
there
were
voices
then
i
saw
a
hand
the
hand
gripped
my
arm
until
it
hurt
a
man
s
rough
voice
said
something
he
was
very
and
then
betty
breathed
all
of
a
sudden
his
voice
changed
he
was
humble
apologetic
he
said

harbor
bells
the
train
came
to
a
jolting
stop
and
they
all
piled
off
indian
point
lena
exclaimed
so
this
is
it
but
where
s
the
city
it
s
not
quite
a
city
lieutenant
warren
said
two
thousand
people
in
summer
one
thousand
in
winter
i
should
say
but
there
are
stores
and
and
a
beauty
parlor
lena
asked
oh
yes
i
should
guess
so
at
least
a
hairdressing
at
that
both
norma
and
betty
laughed
lena
gave
them
a
sharp
look
two
large
ancient
cars
appeared
together
with
a
truck
their
bags
were
piled
into
the
truck
they
crowded
into
the
cars
and
were
driven
away
harbor
bells
that
s
the
name
of
our
little
hotel
their
leader
explained
and
they
call
the
building
where
we
ll
be
working
the
sea
what
fascinating
names
betty
exclaimed
you
ll
find
them
as
fascinating
as
their
names
lieutenant
warren
prophesied
and
there
s
the
sea
norma
exclaimed
how
i
shall
love
it
it
comes
almost
to
our
door
when
there
s
a
storm
and
the
sea
tower
really
gets
its
feet
the
road
twisted
and
turned
first
along
the
rocky
slope
then
above
the
edge
of
a
beach
that
norma
thought
must
be
grand
in
summer
there
it
is
lieutenant
warren
exclaimed
as
they
rounded
a
turn
there
s
our
harbor
bells
just
as
she
said
this
their
ears
were
treated
to
a
great
booming
roar
shook
the
silent
air
good
grief
millie
exclaimed
are
we
being
bombed
not
yet
lieutenant
warren
laughed
that
came
from
the
fort
up
there
on
the
cliffs
two
miles
away
you
can
see
just
a
little
of
its
wall
from
one
gun
salute
for
us
norma
suggested
hardly
that
probably
a
practice
shot
they
don
t
waste
shots
like
that
on
a
handful
of
at
that
they
all
laughed
and
here
they
were
at
the
gate
of
harbor
bells
leaving
their
bags
to
be
brought
in
by
the
truck
driver
and
his
assistants
they
paired
off
and
marched
soldierwise
up
the
broad
sloping
path
to
the
wide
veranda
of
the
hotel
above
the
door
hung
five
bells
of
different
sizes
oh
harbor
bells
betty
exclaimed
seizing
a
small
wooden
hammer
that
lay
on
the
ledge
she
struck
the
bells
one
at
a
time
then
as
they
all
stood
by
enchanted
she
played
in
a
simple
manner
a
tune
they
all
loved
sweet
evening
bells
sweet
evening
bells
how
many
a
tale
their
music
glorious
harbor
bells
norma
exclaimed
harbor
bells
as
they
discovered
very
quickly
was
no
ordinary
summer
hotel
it
had
been
built
for
both
summer
and
winter
in
the
rich
days
when
people
had
plenty
of
gasoline
tired
business
men
from
far
and
wide
drove
to
harbor
bells
for
the
weekend
monahan
the
proprietor
was
a
rare
cook
her
clam
chowder
swordfish
steaks
and
chicken
were
famous
and
this
said
lieutenant
warren
after
she
had
explained
all
this
is
monahan
herself
she
s
agreed
to
stay
with
us
and
take
care
of
us
for
a
while
at
sure
an
if
ye
can
stand
to
have
me
about
monahan
a
round
lady
let
out
a
cackling
laugh
we
ll
stand
you
for
the
duration
if
you
ll
only
stay
the
lieutenant
exclaimed
at
harbor
bells
there
was
both
a
large
and
a
small
dining
room
with
a
huge
fireplace
and
plenty
of
cozy
rooms
upstairs
when
the
girls
had
eaten
a
hearty
meal
of
fried
swordfish
steak
baked
potatoes
blueberry
pie
and
coffee
and
had
settled
themselves
in
their
rooms
they
were
for
the
most
part
ready
for
a
good
long
sleep
not
so
norma
and
betty
monahan
had
kindled
a
fire
on
the
open
hearth
before
this
they
dragged
large
comfortable
chairs
and
settled
themselves
for
a
good
chat
this
said
betty
is
the
real
thing
but
boy
is
it
going
to
be
hard
to
work
here
it
s
too
much
like
natoma
beach
in
florida
dad
has
a
shack
down
there
oh
quite
a
place
and
that
s
where
we
have
our
did
before
the
we
have
a
real
one
norma
said
nothing
even
a
fireplace
just
a
big
kitchen
on
isle
royale
in
lake
superior
it
s
really
grand
there
was
a
pause
work
she
murmured
oh
i
guess
we
ll
work
right
enough
and
you
re
just
right
you
will
it
was
lieutenant
warren
who
spoke
oh
norma
exclaimed
let
me
drag
you
up
a
no
sit
still
i
ll
get
no
no
in
the
end
they
all
took
a
hand
at
bringing
up
the
chair
umm
i
like
this
lieutenant
warren
murmured
who
wouldn
t
betty
exclaimed
and
you
ll
love
the
sea
i
m
eager
to
see
it
said
norma
you
know
lieutenant
warren
mused
every
time
i
settle
down
in
a
new
place
i
feel
an
urge
to
tell
a
story
of
a
rather
strange
thing
that
happened
to
me
in
india
it
s
a
spy
story
really
although
it
didn
t
start
out
that
india
betty
exclaimed
a
spy
story
came
from
norma
she
gave
the
lieutenant
a
searching
look
does
it
have
a
moral
for
young
wacs
not
that
i
know
then
please
tell
it
to
us
norma
urged
just
after
i
finished
college
lieutenant
warren
began
a
friend
secured
a
position
for
me
as
a
teacher
of
english
in
a
school
for
british
girls
in
india
the
school
was
located
close
to
a
fort
very
much
like
fort
des
moines
only
much
larger
ten
thousand
british
troops
were
stationed
there
on
my
way
over
i
had
taken
many
pictures
and
wanted
to
get
them
developed
and
printed
i
was
told
that
a
very
good
german
photographer
had
a
shop
facing
the
army
parade
ground
so
i
hunted
him
up
oh
no
i
couldn
t
do
your
pictures
he
exclaimed
when
i
suggested
it
i
am
far
too
busy
besides
amateurs
they
never
take
good
pictures
never
especially
young
women
their
pictures
are
always
horrible
i
didn
t
say
anything
for
a
moment
just
stared
at
him
and
then
at
his
studio
it
was
a
remarkable
studio
every
inch
of
the
wall
was
covered
with
pictures
too
all
the
leading
british
officers
were
there
and
rich
rulers
of
india
too
and
there
were
pictures
of
wild
animals
in
the
jungle
elephants
tigers
and
water
buffalo
did
you
do
all
these
i
asked
yes
and
many
many
more
you
see
miss
i
am
really
very
famous
as
a
he
was
a
remarkable
man
his
hair
was
white
and
stood
straight
up
and
his
face
was
lined
but
round
and
as
if
it
might
have
been
made
up
for
a
stage
performance
and
you
won
t
do
my
pictures
i
asked
him
i
can
t
waste
my
time
and
money
on
such
rubbish
he
fairly
i
can
just
see
betty
laughed
but
did
he
do
the
pictures
oh
yes
i
was
young
then
and
usually
got
my
way
i
told
him
that
at
least
he
wouldn
t
be
wasting
his
money
for
i
meant
to
pay
him
so
he
said
oh
all
right
bring
them
in
and
we
shall
see
warren
leaned
back
in
her
chair
my
father
was
a
good
amateur
photographer
he
had
taught
me
how
to
take
pictures
my
pictures
came
out
very
well
this
eccentric
photographer
who
hadn
t
had
time
for
me
complimented
and
after
that
norma
laughed
herr
photographer
was
one
of
your
best
not
quite
that
but
he
did
make
many
pictures
and
took
an
unusual
interest
in
showing
me
his
and
that
was
how
you
discovered
he
was
a
spy
suggested
betty
well
no
truth
is
when
i
left
india
i
had
not
the
slightest
notion
that
he
was
a
then
how
in
the
norma
broke
in
the
lieutenant
exclaimed
mockingly
no
turning
to
the
back
of
the
but
to
make
a
long
story
short
she
went
on
this
photographer
had
a
beautiful
place
back
up
in
the
hills
once
he
took
me
there
in
his
car
it
was
a
gorgeous
estate
palm
trees
rare
birds
a
fountain
fed
by
springs
and
a
house
built
of
teakwood
back
of
the
house
were
dovecotes
where
many
rare
varieties
of
pigeons
billed
and
cooed
some
were
jet
black
the
only
black
ones
i
ve
ever
seen
dogs
he
had
a
dozen
of
them
some
of
them
really
looked
ferocious
and
there
were
monkeys
staring
at
you
from
the
regular
norma
drawled
yes
just
that
and
all
for
a
what
came
of
it
norma
asked
well
miss
warren
went
on
he
made
many
pictures
for
me
we
became
quite
good
friends
he
helped
me
and
complimented
me
often
for
all
that
he
appeared
to
be
a
very
strange
person
he
took
pictures
if
it
suited
his
fancy
if
not
he
refused
some
stuffy
old
grand
dame
wanted
to
sit
for
a
picture
and
he
refused
to
do
the
work
then
too
he
was
away
for
weeks
at
a
time
how
he
could
support
his
shop
and
that
mansion
in
the
hills
with
so
little
real
work
i
could
never
understand
in
summer
when
it
was
hot
i
went
to
stay
in
a
very
lovely
resort
high
up
in
the
mountains
the
resort
keeper
wrote
herr
photographer
asking
him
to
come
up
and
take
some
pictures
his
reply
was
miss
rita
warren
is
with
you
she
can
take
them
as
well
as
and
were
you
flattered
betty
laughed
naturally
i
went
to
see
him
as
soon
as
i
returned
he
was
very
cordial
come
he
said
taking
my
hand
as
if
i
were
a
child
i
have
a
picture
to
show
you
it
is
i
think
a
he
led
me
into
a
fairly
large
room
and
switched
on
a
light
there
were
three
objects
in
the
large
picture
in
a
dull
gilt
frame
and
two
very
ordinary
chairs
sit
here
he
said
it
is
the
best
i
sat
down
you
know
he
said
that
this
part
of
india
was
once
ruled
by
the
french
far
up
in
the
mountains
is
one
of
their
ancient
churches
i
found
this
picture
in
the
tower
of
that
church
i
think
it
is
a
madonna
by
i
had
studied
art
in
college
and
was
inclined
to
agree
with
him
one
thing
that
struck
me
as
strange
was
that
in
the
background
on
a
large
rock
sat
three
black
pigeons
then
too
in
many
places
there
were
overtones
of
color
that
did
not
appear
to
belong
there
strangest
of
all
there
were
in
places
faint
suggestions
of
geometric
figures
he
read
the
look
on
my
face
i
am
now
restoring
it
he
explained
well
i
don
t
like
your
part
of
the
work
i
had
spoken
without
thought
this
appeared
to
offend
him
or
did
it
i
couldn
t
quite
tell
he
let
a
cloth
fall
over
the
picture
then
with
a
look
that
seemed
to
say
you
may
know
too
much
he
led
me
from
the
room
that
look
puzzled
me
for
a
long
but
it
doesn
t
any
more
norma
suggested
bright
girl
lieutenant
warren
exclaimed
no
it
doesn
why
what
happened
betty
asked
well
i
left
india
and
returned
to
america
i
heard
nothing
from
my
photographer
for
a
long
long
time
then
england
and
germany
went
to
war
one
day
i
had
a
letter
from
a
friend
in
india
in
it
she
said
you
know
that
photographer
who
took
such
a
shine
to
you
well
he
s
dead
the
british
jerked
him
up
and
shot
him
as
a
master
oh
norma
breathed
end
of
romance
betty
exclaimed
oh
it
wasn
t
quite
that
but
i
was
shocked
to
think
that
i
could
be
so
dumb
those
pigeons
were
of
course
for
carrying
messages
all
over
india
to
his
the
dogs
were
to
ward
off
and
the
pictures
norma
questioned
i
never
found
out
about
that
for
lieutenant
warren
rose
however
i
have
been
told
that
pictures
such
as
those
are
often
shipped
from
place
to
place
to
convey
secret
information
each
bit
of
restoring
as
they
call
it
means
something
properly
coded
that
picture
could
tell
a
whole
lot
well
she
sighed
he
s
dead
but
he
was
rather
good
fun
while
he
the
three
girls
looked
into
the
fire
in
silence
millie
is
our
bugler
lieutenant
warren
suddenly
said
as
she
started
for
the
stairs
when
you
hear
that
bugle
you
ll
know
what
it
breakfast
then
work
norma
said
yes
and
lots
of
it
you
get
two
weeks
of
hard
training
then
you
take
she
was
gone
do
you
suppose
she
suspects
we
re
spy
chasers
norma
whispered
can
t
betty
whispered
back
but
jeepers
if
she
didn
t
know
that
man
was
a
spy
what
about
us
we
ve
not
even
got
a
norma
agreed
and
she
did
not
finish
betty
went
at
once
to
her
room
but
norma
having
caught
a
gleam
of
light
through
a
window
stepped
out
on
the
porch
for
a
look
at
the
moon
to
one
who
sees
it
for
the
first
time
the
moon
casting
shadows
over
the
rugged
cliffs
and
painting
a
path
of
gold
across
the
sea
is
a
gorgeous
sight
slipping
silently
to
the
top
of
the
steps
leading
to
the
path
she
stood
there
in
the
shadows
then
for
some
reason
or
perhaps
none
at
snapped
on
the
flashlight
she
held
in
her
hand
to
paint
her
own
path
of
gold
down
the
gravel
walk
then
it
was
that
she
got
a
shock
for
there
half
hidden
by
the
broad
stone
post
of
the
street
wall
stood
a
man
he
wore
no
hat
white
hair
gleamed
over
a
round
face
in
his
hand
he
held
a
black
box
with
a
reflector
at
the
top
the
sort
of
camera
used
most
by
newspaper
men
and
other
professionals
to
say
that
she
was
startled
would
be
to
put
it
mildly
this
mood
ended
quickly
for
the
man
snapped
at
her
in
the
voice
of
an
angry
dog
keep
your
light
to
yourself
this
is
a
public
street
i
ll
stand
here
as
long
as
i
turning
about
the
girl
marched
back
into
the
hotel
she
was
trembling
all
over
right
out
of
that
story
she
whispered
halfway
round
the
as
she
climbed
the
stairs
she
thought
i
ll
not
tell
a
soul
i
didn
t
really
see
imagined
as
if
to
verify
this
she
went
to
her
window
and
looked
down
the
moonlight
was
brighter
now
there
was
no
one
by
the
gate
and
yet
cold
reason
told
her
she
had
seen
that
man
beside
the
pillar

the

stared
for
a
without
further
comment

them
to
a
large
circular
room
where
three
officers
and
six
enlisted

were
working
with

unimportant
post

might
say

whirled
a
large
globe
around
then
put
his
finger
on
a
spot
that

norway
here

greenland
planes
coming
from

right

he
exclaimed
there
was
little
of
adventure
or
romance
in
the
days
that
followed
for
as
in
fort
des
moines
they
were
hard
at
work
learning
the
tasks
that
lay
ahead
up
at
five
each
morning
they
were
glad
enough
to
creep
into
their
fine
warm
beds
at
each
night
illustration
take
a
look
at
this
globe
the
major
during
the
first
week
they
worked
only
during
the
day
they
were
being
instructed
that
was
all
eventually
they
would
be
divided
into
three
shifts
and
the
task
of
watching
would
go
on
and
on
round
the
clock
when
the
work
really
started
in
earnest
norma
millie
and
rosa
were
to
work
in
one
shift
norma
would
be
in
charge
of
marking
maps
and
charts
millie
would
manage
the
switchboard
and
receive
calls
rosa
s
job
was
to
carry
messages
and
be
on
the
alert
for
any
task
in
the
second
shift
betty
took
norma
s
place
a
girl
named
mary
ran
the
switchboard
and
lena
took
rosa
s
place
the
third
shift
was
made
up
of
the
remaining
girls
of
the
squad
saturday
with
its
arrived
norma
and
betty
rented
bicycles
and
went
for
a
joyous
ride
into
the
country
norma
who
had
stocked
up
on
films
took
many
interesting
pictures
but
on
major
stark
s
suggestion
avoided
all
military
subjects
it
was
because
they
were
as
yet
working
only
in
the
daytime
that
an
exciting
event
occurred
that
threatened
disaster
one
morning
as
the
wacs
were
enjoying
their
wheatcakes
vermont
maple
syrup
and
coffee
major
stark
came
walking
into
the
room
good
morning
major
stark
lieutenant
warren
exclaimed
you
re
just
in
time
i
ll
have
a
plate
set
on
for
thanks
very
the
major
s
smile
was
slow
i
ve
had
my
breakfast
it
s
your
young
ladies
i
wished
to
talk
about
now
zeal
is
a
commendable
virtue
but
i
really
can
t
have
them
coming
to
the
sea
tower
demanding
further
education
near
midnight
it
s
a
bit
demoralizing
and
besides
that
is
the
most
important
hour
of
but
i
don
t
understand
miss
warren
looked
puzzled
turning
to
the
girls
she
said
which
of
you
went
to
the
sea
tower
after
hours
not
a
girl
spoke
do
you
see
major
she
smiled
not
one
was
but
are
they
all
here
now
yes
all
then
it
was
the
ghost
of
a
wac
for
tom
my
most
trustworthy
sergeant
told
me
a
woman
in
a
wac
uniform
and
with
her
identification
card
all
correct
was
at
the
tower
for
an
hour
learning
about
charts
and
other
matters
last
night
she
looked
dark
and
sort
of
spanish
he
said
they
all
looked
at
rosa
but
rosa
shook
her
head
she
was
in
bed
lena
stated
simply
we
re
and
besides
she
doesn
t
look
spanish
said
the
major
well
there
s
a
mystery
for
you
i
ll
send
for
tom
at
norma
leaned
over
to
whisper
in
betty
s
ear
the
spanish
hairdresser
betty
nearly
fell
off
her
chair
they
were
all
in
the
big
living
room
when
the
major
returned
with
a
young
sergeant
now
then
sergeant
he
challenged
which
one
was
it
sergeant
tom
looked
them
over
carefully
then
replied
none
of
these
well
now
tom
make
up
your
mind
the
major
s
temper
was
rising
you
ve
been
saying
one
was
up
there
and
now
you
there
was
a
wac
uniform
with
a
lady
in
it
at
the
tower
last
night
tom
insisted
but
don
t
you
know
all
these
ladies
tom
no
major
i
don
t
i
work
at
night
you
so
all
the
soldiers
don
t
know
all
the
wacs
the
major
exclaimed
we
ll
fix
that
we
ll
hold
a
then
suddenly
his
face
purpled
by
thunder
he
exclaimed
it
s
happened
a
lady
spy
in
a
wac
uniform
it
was
bound
to
be
that
way
but
why
must
we
be
her
first
victims
tom
how
much
did
you
tell
her
to
tell
the
truth
major
tom
smiled
sheepishly
i
didn
t
tell
her
least
nothing
of
importance
the
truth
is
sir
some
of
us
boys
sort
of
feel
that
having
the
girls
s
fine
but
when
they
start
doing
our
then
you
didn
t
tell
her
about
secret
devices
and
all
that
the
major
broke
in
not
a
thing
that
she
couldn
t
have
gotten
out
of
a
that
s
fine
the
major
exclaimed
glad
to
see
you
so
beg
pardon
sir
said
tom
but
this
is
my
time
for
sleeping
i
ll
see
you
all
at
the
he
grinned
broadly
as
he
went
out
this
thing
must
be
looked
into
at
once
said
the
major
i
ll
have
a
man
in
for
that
purpose
i
shall
need
your
we
ll
give
you
every
assistance
possible
said
lieutenant
warren
at
that
the
major
bowed
himself
out
fresh
coffee
was
poured
and
the
meal
resumed
how
terrible
millie
exclaimed
the
spanish
hairdresser
norma
whispered
to
betty
once
more
late
that
afternoon
the
major
returned
bringing
with
him
a
little
man
who
called
himself
sperry
mr
sperry
wishes
to
know
he
explained
if
any
of
you
can
give
him
a
clue
regarding
the
young
lady
who
undoubtedly
is
masquerading
in
a
wac
that
s
it
the
little
man
cackled
just
that
the
sergeant
in
charge
tells
me
she
had
an
identification
no
doubt
have
any
of
you
by
chance
lost
your
card
there
followed
a
hasty
delving
into
purses
and
pockets
each
girl
held
up
her
card
ah
yes
i
see
all
quite
in
order
i
suggest
that
fresh
photographs
of
these
ladies
be
young
lady
in
that
they
be
placed
on
identification
cards
these
should
bear
your
signature
your
men
are
acquainted
with
that
signature
every
man
the
major
agreed
the
pictures
shall
be
taken
there
s
a
good
man
but
granite
head
lieutenant
warren
have
your
young
ladies
ready
at
nine
tomorrow
i
shall
send
cars
for
now
exclaimed
the
little
man
dancing
about
any
of
you
know
a
young
lady
who
wears
her
black
hair
high
and
has
rather
slanting
spanish
eyes
here
norma
asked
there
was
one
at
fort
des
moines
norma
hesitated
but
s
a
long
way
was
she
in
training
no
one
of
our
ah
the
little
man
whistled
between
his
teeth
just
the
type
you
haven
t
seen
her
here
sperry
asked
the
other
girls
about
the
hairdresser
some
recalled
her
and
some
did
not
watching
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
norma
thought
she
saw
lena
start
as
her
name
was
called
oh
yes
i
remember
her
she
said
in
a
low
drawl
she
did
my
hair
many
times
she
was
really
good
but
i
don
t
no
of
course
the
little
man
snapped
that
s
not
to
be
at
that
he
closed
his
notebook
and
indicated
by
a
nod
that
he
had
finished
the
jeeps
will
be
here
at
said
the
major
the
girls
will
be
ready
replied
lieutenant
warren
oh
i
just
remembered
something
norma
exclaimed
in
a
whisper
a
short
time
later
what
was
that
betty
asked
i
took
a
few
pictures
at
des
moines
but
never
had
the
film
well
betty
drawled
one
was
a
picture
of
that
spanish
hairdresser
just
as
she
passed
through
the
gate
just
a
snap
but
in
bright
sunlight
it
should
be
that
might
be
sure
sperry
could
show
it
to
sergeant
tom
for
identification
i
have
three
films
now
i
ll
take
them
to
that
photographer
chapter
xiv
pale
hands
next
morning
at
nine
the
girls
all
but
lena
who
had
obtained
permission
to
ride
ahead
on
a
bike
piled
into
two
jeeps
and
were
driven
away
to
the
photographer
s
studio
the
moment
norma
stepped
into
the
studio
she
had
a
strange
feeling
that
she
had
seen
it
before
its
walls
were
crowded
with
pictures
many
of
them
officers
in
the
fort
above
their
post
she
guessed
then
too
there
were
ship
s
officers
some
of
them
from
the
united
states
and
british
navies
there
were
pictures
from
the
wilds
of
maine
and
canada
as
well
wolves
prowling
over
the
snow
a
moose
charging
up
from
the
waters
of
a
lake
and
many
others
there
were
many
wonderful
pictures
in
the
collection
and
she
was
charmed
at
the
thought
of
having
her
films
developed
and
printed
here
if
the
studio
had
been
a
surprise
the
proprietor
as
he
came
bustling
into
the
room
was
a
great
shock
his
hair
was
white
and
bristling
his
face
was
lined
in
spite
of
its
round
softness
it
was
he
whom
she
had
seen
at
the
gate
of
harbor
bells
he
who
had
growled
at
her
because
she
threw
her
light
upon
him
good
grief
she
whispered
to
betty
i
hope
he
doesn
t
recognize
me
recognize
you
betty
murmured
in
surprise
shish
norma
warned
she
had
never
told
betty
of
that
other
encounter
in
her
hand
she
held
the
films
she
wished
developed
will
you
do
these
for
me
she
asked
amateur
work
he
exclaimed
bah
what
do
amateurs
know
about
pictures
especially
young
women
no
i
can
not
waste
my
time
and
but
you
ll
not
be
wasting
your
norma
felt
like
one
speaking
a
piece
i
expect
to
pay
you
for
put
them
down
there
on
this
table
he
replied
rudely
we
shall
and
his
voice
took
on
a
professional
tone
you
are
soldiers
is
it
not
so
there
came
a
murmured
lady
soldiers
this
is
delightful
and
i
am
to
take
your
pictures
no
retouching
is
it
not
so
that
s
it
was
betty
who
spoke
then
you
will
not
be
very
beautiful
in
these
he
laughed
again
they
are
for
identification
norma
suggestion
of
irritation
creeping
into
her
voice
beauty
doesn
t
count
they
must
look
like
us
that
s
all
they
are
to
keep
spies
from
pretending
they
belong
to
our
spies
ah
is
that
so
he
said
seriously
then
they
shall
be
very
real
indeed
these
he
began
his
work
at
once
since
she
did
not
particularly
like
the
man
and
wished
to
get
her
part
over
with
norma
posed
first
she
realized
at
once
that
he
proposed
to
take
her
in
an
unfavorable
light
and
at
a
bad
angle
yet
she
made
no
objection
as
he
was
about
to
make
the
shot
she
managed
a
derisive
grin
no
no
he
stomped
the
floor
that
way
you
spoil
the
picture
norma
at
once
put
on
a
perfectly
dumb
look
then
the
picture
was
snapped
what
s
wrong
with
you
betty
demanded
in
a
whisper
when
they
were
alone
was
the
quiet
reply
lena
s
not
said
rosa
she
ll
be
norma
said
while
the
other
pictures
were
being
taken
norma
wandered
along
the
wall
looking
at
pictures
until
she
was
near
an
open
door
leading
to
another
room
as
she
stood
there
she
heard
a
man
s
voice
say
you
must
i
won
t
came
a
woman
s
reply
carl
langer
the
photographer
must
have
heard
for
he
said
excuse
me
ladies
and
shut
the
door
what
wonderful
ears
norma
thought
he
should
be
a
plane
illustration
no
no
that
way
you
spoil
the
when
the
pictures
had
been
taken
and
the
girls
were
filing
out
of
the
room
betty
said
to
norma
lena
didn
t
show
oh
sure
norma
hesitated
well
anyway
her
picture
will
be
in
the
lot
you
can
depend
upon
as
they
climbed
into
the
jeeps
norma
heard
a
pigeon
cooing
and
looking
up
to
the
studio
roof
she
saw
two
pigeons
they
were
jet
black
this
gave
her
a
start
but
she
said
never
a
word
they
were
halfway
back
to
the
post
when
suddenly
she
realized
that
she
had
left
her
films
without
any
decision
having
been
made
about
them
i
left
my
films
she
said
to
betty
do
you
suppose
he
ll
develop
them
my
guess
is
that
he
betty
s
guess
was
right
and
this
norma
would
live
to
regret
all
the
while
i
was
there
i
felt
i
had
been
in
that
place
before
said
norma
i
shouldn
t
wonder
was
betty
s
strange
reply
there
was
one
extra
person
in
the
squad
which
meant
that
while
the
others
were
taking
their
turn
at
training
three
at
a
time
one
was
free
to
undertake
some
special
task
this
was
norma
s
day
off
norma
lieutenant
warren
said
to
her
after
she
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
day
working
over
some
special
type
of
chart
i
think
you
told
me
once
that
you
had
ridden
a
oh
yes
many
times
was
the
quick
reply
my
father
and
i
used
to
cover
part
of
his
territory
on
a
good
one
of
our
tasks
is
to
be
that
of
keeping
in
touch
with
the
plane
spotters
in
our
territory
they
are
all
volunteers
they
work
without
pay
and
are
i
am
sure
very
conscientious
they
must
norma
agreed
and
do
you
know
i
really
like
these
real
new
they
seem
more
genuinely
american
than
most
people
i
ve
come
to
know
miss
warren
agreed
what
i
wanted
to
suggest
was
that
now
and
then
you
take
a
are
two
in
the
basement
room
of
the
sea
visit
these
spotter
sheds
there
s
one
near
granite
i
think
i
saw
it
as
i
passed
this
i
haven
t
a
doubt
of
it
you
might
like
to
take
a
run
out
there
right
now
the
lieutenant
suggested
that
would
be
real
fun
thank
you
so
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
dressed
in
her
fatigue
suit
and
with
stout
coveralls
drawn
over
it
norma
leapt
on
her
motorcycle
and
went
away
she
was
not
long
in
reaching
the
place
in
the
road
nearest
the
spotter
shed
as
she
paused
to
study
the
steep
road
leading
up
to
the
shed
two
girls
who
were
undoubtedly
twins
came
hurrying
from
the
opposite
direction
seeing
that
they
were
about
to
start
the
climb
norma
said
going
up
hop
on
behind
i
think
this
thing
will
take
us
all
oh
fine
they
exclaimed
we
re
late
for
what
norma
asked
we
re
spotters
i
m
beth
and
this
is
bess
my
sister
one
of
the
twins
explained
we
re
on
from
now
until
midnight
the
other
said
whew
norma
exclaimed
that
s
a
long
spot
for
a
oh
we
don
t
mind
said
beth
laughing
only
one
is
needed
to
watch
at
a
the
other
one
studies
we
re
still
in
high
school
said
bess
sometimes
we
fall
with
a
final
snort
the
motorcycle
reached
the
crest
of
the
hill
then
circled
to
a
stop
at
the
foot
of
a
crooked
stairway
leading
to
a
crow
perch
above
up
then
around
then
up
again
they
climbed
thirty
feet
into
the
air
to
arrive
at
last
at
a
broad
enclosed
platform
all
right
girls

may
take
a
tall
man
with
prematurely
gray
hair
turned
toward
a
door
leading
from
the
platform
who

your
friend
he
asked
turning
half
about
behind
his
thick
glasses
norma
saw
keen
smiling
eyes
why
beth
hesitated

of
those
wac

laughed
holding
her
cap
bearing
the
insignia

the
light
oh

reading
about

held
out
a
hand
for
a
firm
and
friendly
clasp
so
when
we
report
one
single
flying
high
we
ll
soon
be
talking
to
a
lady

hoping

norma
exclaimed
at
that
a
man
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
and
this
is
jim
marston
said
garson
used
to
be
a
parson
now
he
s
a
plain
and
that
said
the
retired
parson

a
great
they
re
really
very
famous
men
beth
whispered
as
they
disappeared
down
the
stairs
mr
garson
designed
the
stained
glass
windows
for
half
the
big
churches
in
boston
and
marston
was
a
famous
bishop

she
added
well
here

exclaimed
this
is
our
spotter
shed
isn
t
it
neat
neat
and
very
norma
held
her
hands
before
the
glowing
coal
fire
it
cost
a
thousand
dollars
everyone
chipped
in
but
it
s
worth
it
it
must
stand
for
the
duration
said
beth
so
you
ll
be
listening
to
our
reports
said
bess
it
s
nice
to
know
you
ll
all
stand
that
s
right
we
norma
s
heart
was
warmed
oh
bess
exclaimed
we
ve
forgotten
we
re
late
it
s
time
to
talk
to
hastily
unlocking
a
closet
door
in
the
corner
she
wheeled
out
a
mechanism
with
a
square
of
glass
at
its
front
after
connecting
some
heavy
electric
wires
she
turned
on
a
switch
and
at
once
there
came
a
low
buzzing
sound
night
was
falling
the
room
was
full
of
shadows
watch
said
bess
the
square
of
glass
gave
forth
a
faint
glow
then
at
the
center
of
it
something
moved
a
hand
norma
thought
with
a
start
it
was
true
behind
that
glass
appeared
a
pale
hand
it
moved
it
took
on
different
forms
now
it
was
clenched
with
the
thumb
outside
now
three
fingers
were
folded
in
while
the
forefinger
and
thumb
stuck
straight
out
this
was
repeated
once
again
the
hand
was
clenched
this
time
with
the
thumb
folded
in
tight
three
fingers
up
one
fingers
down
thumb
bent
in
then
again
three
fingers
down
forefinger
and
thumb
up
and
repeat
then
the
hand
vanished
he
says
all
is
bess
said
in
a
tone
talking
with
the
dead
norma
thought
with
a
shudder
chapter
xv
spotters
in
the
night
that
s
spooky
norma
whispered
your
grandfather
doesn
t
by
any
chance
happen
to
be
in
heaven
yes
he
beth
laughed
his
kind
of
heaven
he
s
over
on
black
black
knob
what
s
that
it
s
an
island
ten
miles
off
shore
grandfather
calls
it
his
retreat
he
s
a
writer
on
technical
subjects
and
an
he
has
plenty
of
money
put
in
bess
so
he
just
writes
and
and
by
and
by
someone
gives
him
money
for
an
invention
so
he
can
invent
some
more
beth
finished
sounds
wonderful
said
norma
but
what
about
this
thing
she
pointed
to
the
square
of
light
where
that
expressive
hand
was
opening
and
closing
pointing
and
writhing
again
beth
was
writing
down
letters
rapidly
so
it
was
bess
who
replied
in
a
whisper
it
s
a
great
secret
only
beth
grandfather
and
i
know
about
it
shall
i
tell
her
she
turned
to
her
sister
beth
nodded
cross
your
heart
and
hope
to
die
bess
whispered
impressively
you
won
t
tell
a
soul
not
a
my
heart
and
hope
to
well
s
television
bess
confided
only
there
s
no
sound
words
without
sound
it
s
a
perfectly
secret
way
of
communication
as
long
as
no
one
knows
about
but
i
don
t
the
hand
was
still
going
through
its
weird
motions
it
s
very
simple
said
bess
grandfather
has
two
moving
picture
cameras
trained
on
his
hand
over
there
on
black
i
guessed
that
the
rest
is
deaf
and
dumb
alphabet
that
s
all
a
is
a
clenched
fist
with
the
thumb
turned
in
and
how
stupid
i
am
norma
exclaimed
i
should
have
guessed
it
at
once
oh
no
bess
laughed
strange
things
always
stick
us
we
want
a
weird
explanation
when
it
is
something
just
as
simple
as
it
s
quite
wonderful
norma
exclaimed
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
something
tremendously
important
would
come
out
of
she
was
not
wrong
in
this
prediction
black
knob
is
an
important
point
said
bess
it
s
so
far
off
it
must
be
was
the
quick
reply
particularly
for
enemy
submarines
i
m
going
to
tell
lieutenant
warren
about
but
not
about
television
bess
warned
at
least
not
without
grandfather
s
not
about
television
norma
agreed
once
again
the
hand
had
vanished
from
the
square
of
light
this
time
beth
pushed
the
apparatus
into
a
corner
and
threw
a
cloth
over
it
he
reports
once
each
hour
until
midnight
she
explained
if
anything
really
startling
comes
up
he
gives
us
a
buzz
on
a
radio
and
we
turn
on
television
for
a
special
after
midnight
norma
asked
two
elderly
ladies
take
over
until
morning
they
use
short
wave
entirely
during
the
day
fishermen
who
live
there
keep
a
sharp
it
s
not
much
of
a
setup
for
so
important
a
spot
bess
said
one
old
man
two
women
and
some
fishermen
but
it
s
all
there
is
there
in
it
might
be
improved
upon
norma
agreed
well
said
bess
drawing
on
a
heavy
coat
i
ll
get
out
on
the
listening
platform
it
s
all
ears
from
now
till
unless
they
show
a
light
norma
suggested
no
enemy
would
show
a
light
was
the
reply
as
bess
left
her
comfortable
place
by
the
fire
norma
noticed
that
outside
the
wind
was
picking
up
and
snow
beginning
to
fall
not
going
to
be
a
nice
night
was
her
comment
winter
s
almost
gone
was
beth
s
reply
we
ve
had
some
really
bad
nights
i
can
tell
what
s
the
payoff
norma
asked
without
thinking
this
is
our
country
beth
drew
herself
up
proudly
no
enemy
planes
have
ever
got
past
mean
all
of
just
bess
and
me
and
they
never
will
there
are
hundreds
of
watchers
all
along
the
and
if
you
hadn
t
been
here
they
would
have
tried
norma
suggested
absolutely
it
s
grand
work
we
re
going
to
help
you
all
we
that
s
not
all
there
is
to
beth
leaned
forward
we
saved
two
lives
fighting
men
they
were
too
they
gave
us
the
credit
just
bess
grandfather
and
me
see
she
held
out
a
medal
that
read
for
valiant
service
that
s
wonderful
norma
exclaimed
i
hope
i
can
do
as
oh
you
will
and
a
lot
more
you
re
a
are
really
in
the
army
i
wish
i
could
be
a
there
was
intense
longing
in
the
younger
girl
s
voice
perhaps
they
ll
lower
the
age
here
s
hoping
want
to
tell
me
about
this
rescue
norma
asked
oh
sure
it
wasn
t
much
was
the
modest
reply
just
our
good
luck
that
s
all
it
was
grandfather
who
spotted
the
plane
first
just
before
midnight
he
gave
us
the
radio
buzz
then
started
talking
fast
with
his
you
know
this
plane
had
just
passed
over
black
knob
there
was
a
fog
he
heard
it
that
s
all
it
was
going
north
slowly
we
beth
stopped
short
bess
thrust
her
head
in
at
the
door
one
single
going
south
fast
about
five
miles
off
shore
she
announced
instantly
beth
was
on
the
phone
saving
in
a
clearcut
voice
one
single
going
south
fast
about
five
miles
off
shore
granite
head
she
kept
a
over
one
ear
but
went
on
with
her
story
bess
reported
that
plane
over
black
knob
at
once
the
army
navy
and
civil
air
patrol
had
no
such
plane
out
that
they
knew
of
that
made
it
exciting
i
can
tell
you
might
have
been
an
enemy
plane
scouting
and
there
were
too
many
lights
burning
in
portland
that
what
happened
norma
demanded
eagerly
grandfather
kept
hearing
them
and
reporting
for
half
an
hour
then
a
fighter
plane
went
out
but
couldn
t
find
them
in
the
fog
they
came
in
quite
close
to
black
knob
then
the
motor
went
off
grandfather
was
outside
he
was
sure
they
went
into
the
he
heard
a
splash
bess
broke
off
suddenly
to
press
the
to
her
ear
she
listened
intently
for
a
moment
then
murmured
into
her
speaker
stepping
to
the
door
she
said
to
her
sister
just
another
navy
plane
off
its
course
pilot
called
for
directions
and
got
see
that
s
the
way
it
she
said
to
norma
i
see
said
norma
disappointing
yes
every
time
but
one
out
of
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
i
guess
and
tell
the
rest
norma
urged
oh
about
those
two
fliers
that
was
exciting
i
can
tell
you
grandfather
gave
us
the
word
that
the
plane
was
down
then
he
got
the
fishermen
out
of
bed
three
boats
went
out
grandfather
s
boat
spotted
them
just
in
time
their
plane
sank
ten
minutes
later
they
were
army
trainer
and
a
student
umm
that
student
was
handsome
and
he
would
have
drowned
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
you
spotters
norma
said
that
said
norma
was
wonderful
as
she
stepped
out
of
the
comfortable
room
into
the
night
norma
saw
a
covered
with
snow
spotters
she
whispered
as
she
went
down
the
stairs
spotters
in
the
chapter
xvi
the
vanishing
print
norma
was
up
bright
and
early
next
morning
as
she
stepped
out
on
the
porch
for
a
breath
of
air
her
eyes
were
greeted
by
a
scene
of
marvelous
beauty
back
of
a
dark
spot
rising
from
the
sea
which
must
she
thought
be
black
knob
the
sun
was
rising
what
a
picture
she
knew
just
how
it
should
be
taken
racing
into
the
house
she
put
her
hand
on
the
mantel
at
the
spot
where
she
had
left
her
camera
gone
she
murmured
it
s
gone
well
after
all
she
might
be
mistaken
perhaps
she
had
taken
it
to
her
room
rushing
upstairs
she
began
a
hurried
search
what
s
up
betty
demanded
house
on
fire
no
a
gorgeous
picture
to
be
taken
and
i
ve
misplaced
my
here
take
mine
betty
took
her
camera
from
the
shelf
without
a
word
norma
grabbed
the
camera
and
raced
down
the
stairs
to
take
three
exposures
before
the
sun
was
too
high
i
can
t
imagine
what
could
have
happened
to
my
camera
she
exclaimed
after
a
thorough
search
i
m
sure
i
left
it
on
the
mantel
downstairs
i
took
two
shots
of
the
fishermen
s
boats
coming
in
yesterday
then
put
it
on
the
mantel
and
forgot
oh
it
will
show
betty
was
a
cheerful
soul
at
breakfast
that
morning
norma
sat
by
lieutenant
warren
and
told
her
all
about
bess
beth
their
grandfather
and
black
knob
that
seems
an
admirable
spot
for
a
spotter
shed
said
miss
warren
it
must
be
norma
agreed
of
course
it
has
its
watching
post
but
it
seems
grandfather
and
two
old
ladies
for
the
night
and
fishermen
keeping
an
eye
out
during
the
day
doesn
t
sound
very
no
it
doesn
t
we
may
want
to
lend
them
a
helping
hand
i
ve
asked
for
six
more
auxiliaries
for
just
such
i
m
glad
of
that
norma
said
we
may
need
them
more
than
you
think
before
a
month
has
why
what
do
you
mean
by
that
the
lieutenant
gave
her
a
sharp
look
just
a
hunch
i
guess
norma
evaded
she
wasn
t
going
to
tell
of
the
photographer
with
bristly
white
hair
of
the
voices
behind
scenes
at
the
studio
the
black
pigeons
or
the
missing
camera
until
she
had
more
to
tell
late
that
afternoon
she
picked
up
another
shred
of
evidence
when
the
day
s
work
was
done
she
got
out
one
of
the
motorcycles
and
rode
back
to
the
photography
studio
carl
langer
had
promised
that
the
pictures
for
their
identification
cards
would
be
done
then
too
she
was
wondering
about
the
three
films
she
had
left
on
his
table
by
the
time
she
arrived
fog
had
driven
in
from
the
sea
making
everything
look
dark
and
gloomy
the
studio
seemed
darkest
most
gloomy
of
all
only
a
faint
light
showed
through
the
window
the
three
black
pigeons
sat
silently
along
the
ridge
of
the
roof
as
if
her
arrival
had
disturbed
them
they
took
off
with
noisy
flapping
of
wings
to
soar
away
and
lose
themselves
in
the
fog
out
over
the
sea
norma
tried
the
door
it
was
locked
she
rang
the
bell
no
response
a
second
ring
failed
a
third
long
one
brought
an
angry
response
the
door
flew
open
and
langer
s
white
hair
seemed
to
give
off
sparks
as
he
stormed
angrily
why
do
you
ring
now
you
know
my
hours
everybody
knows
he
broke
off
short
at
last
he
had
taken
time
to
look
at
his
caller
oh
it
is
his
voice
changed
you
are
miss
kent
one
of
those
lady
he
laughed
hoarsely
come
in
the
pictures
are
done
they
are
not
beautiful
but
he
laughed
again
he
did
not
turn
on
more
light
a
small
lamp
on
a
table
gave
out
a
feeble
glow
see
he
said
shuffling
a
pack
of
prints
as
if
they
were
playing
cards
here
they
are
all
of
yes
there
they
all
were
and
lena
s
picture
was
on
top
really
the
best
of
the
lot
norma
thought
she
was
not
surprised
about
my
films
she
hesitated
oh
yes
i
have
done
these
too
he
exclaimed
with
sudden
enthusiasm
they
re
very
good
you
really
understand
timing
light
grouping
and
all
that
some
of
these
village
pictures
they
are
excellent
with
your
permission
i
shall
retain
three
films
for
a
short
time
only
that
i
may
make
s
all
right
norma
replied
she
was
looking
at
the
pictures
one
by
one
and
at
the
same
time
counting
them
in
the
end
she
drew
in
a
deep
breath
there
should
have
been
one
was
missing
and
that
one
she
thought
with
a
start
is
the
one
i
took
of
the
spanish
hairdresser
at
fort
des
moines
what
a
fool
i
was
to
let
this
man
do
them
she
told
herself
there
are
only
prints
here
she
suggested
trying
to
keep
her
voice
on
an
even
scale
good
pictures
out
of
he
exclaimed
this
is
remarkable
for
an
amateur
my
dear
what
should
one
expect
she
wanted
to
say
you
are
telling
a
lie
that
was
a
good
picture
taken
in
bright
light
of
a
second
and
shutter
half
open
i
couldn
t
have
she
said
nothing
of
the
sort
instead
she
said
you
ll
make
the
some
enlargements
of
the
films
you
are
keeping
to
be
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
very
fine
ones
and
my
dear
they
shall
cost
you
absolutely
nothing
i
shall
charge
you
nothing
for
these
you
are
almost
a
genius
at
light
shadows
and
grouping
such
a
choice
of
subjects
such
placing
to
bring
out
the
angles
and
the
contrasts
please
allow
me
to
do
all
your
where
have
i
heard
all
that
before
the
girl
asked
herself
as
she
left
the
place
the
answer
she
felt
sure
was
never
anywhere
it
was
strange
as
she
mounted
her
motorcycle
and
set
it
the
three
black
pigeons
who
had
returned
once
more
went
flapping
out
to
sea
pointing
the
way
to
black
knob
she
told
herself
i
wonder
if
they
ever
go
all
the
way
days
glided
by
there
was
study
and
work
hours
on
end
at
last
more
work
and
less
study
they
studied
types
of
airplanes
and
subs
until
they
were
fairly
sure
of
recognizing
them
in
daylight
learning
them
by
sound
would
be
quite
another
matter
for
some
enemy
planes
they
had
sound
recordings
norma
who
had
quite
a
remarkable
ear
for
sound
variations
spent
hours
on
end
listening
first
to
the
american
fighter
planes
that
every
day
zoomed
overhead
and
then
to
the
recordings
of
zeros
and
messerschmitts
the
day
after
her
camera
disappeared
she
found
it
just
where
she
had
left
it
had
someone
taken
it
by
mistake
and
returned
it
did
sperry
or
someone
else
suspect
her
of
taking
forbidden
snapshots
this
seemed
improbable
for
she
had
taken
two
pictures
and
the
spot
still
showed
number
three
what
was
more
the
shutter
was
just
as
she
had
left
it
and
the
time
still
set
at
of
a
second
it
can
t
have
been
someone
who
wished
to
use
it
for
taking
forbidden
pictures
either
betty
assured
her
no
pictures
have
been
to
her
great
surprise
when
at
last
the
film
was
used
up
and
she
had
it
developed
she
was
told
that
the
first
two
pictures
had
turned
out
as
blanks
carl
langer
showed
her
the
blanks
as
proof
positive
yet
to
norma
this
was
not
absolute
proof
for
she
told
herself
those
were
very
ordinary
snapshots
the
other
pictures
were
taken
under
the
same
circumstances
nothing
had
been
done
to
the
camera
and
yet
they
came
out
very
her
curiosity
was
aroused
after
two
days
had
elapsed
she
again
left
her
camera
lying
about
once
again
it
vanished
in
two
days
it
was
back
this
time
she
had
left
number
four
showing
hastily
using
up
the
film
she
hurried
to
the
studio
and
had
the
film
developed
some
of
your
pictures
are
quite
wonderful
carl
langer
commented
but
the
first
i
know
they
are
norma
thought
this
but
didn
t
say
it
she
was
wrong
the
first
three
were
quite
black
very
much
overexposed
they
showed
nothing
perhaps
said
langer
you
were
a
bit
careless
putting
in
that
film
it
looks
at
the
she
had
not
been
careless
the
film
was
not
yet
she
said
never
a
word
she
would
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
yet
the
next
day
norma
forgot
her
photographic
problems
for
at
last
a
visit
to
black
knob
was
on
the
calendar
norma
had
made
two
more
visits
to
the
spotter
shed
at
granite
point
with
interest
she
had
watched
the
talking
hands
from
the
island
and
had
listened
to
weird
and
interesting
tales
told
of
the
great
rock
called
black
knob
by
those
fascinating
twins
beth
and
bess
at
first
it
was
planned
that
only
norma
and
betty
should
accompany
lieutenant
warren
on
the
trip
to
black
knob
but
at
the
last
moment
lena
asked
permission
to
go
perhaps
miss
warren
knew
some
things
about
this
tall
strong
girl
that
norma
had
never
learned
certain
it
is
that
had
it
been
left
to
her
she
would
have
said
no
let
s
not
take
lena
went
along
the
journey
out
was
uneventful
norma
and
betty
took
turns
at
the
wheel
their
experience
piloting
boats
at
summer
camps
stood
them
in
good
stead
as
black
knob
loomed
up
larger
they
made
out
trees
growing
like
bushy
hair
on
its
crest
and
close
beside
a
small
harbor
formed
by
an
outcropping
of
rocks
a
group
of
fishermen
s
cottages
and
summer
tourist
cabins
a
small
man
with
a
full
gray
beard
took
their
line
at
the
narrow
dock
lieutenant
warren
he
exclaimed
i
am
glad
to
see
you
the
girls
have
been
telling
me
on
short
wave
radio
about
you
and
one
of
your
workers
they
call
her
this
is
norma
said
miss
warren
helping
norma
out
of
the
boat
ah
said
the
little
man
i
am
indeed
glad
to
meet
you
as
you
must
have
guessed
i
am
the
grandfather
of
bess
and
beth
dudley
norton
is
the
name
i
drew
when
i
was
he
laughed
in
a
friendly
cackling
way
and
here
he
added
as
a
girl
came
dancing
down
the
path
is
my
chief
assistant
patsy
her
principal
task
is
keeping
the
bad
gremlins
gremlins
said
norma
what
are
gremlins
oh
they
are
little
people
the
girl
who
was
the
living
picture
of
bess
and
beth
explained
the
bad
ones
put
ice
on
your
airplane
s
wings
and
stop
up
your
guns
when
you
want
to
shoot
but
the
good
ones
get
out
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
them
and
blow
on
the
sea
to
make
a
big
storm
when
the
enemy
subs
are
oh
that
s
the
way
it
is
lieutenant
warren
said
but
aren
t
you
afraid
to
live
way
out
here
when
so
many
gremlins
are
about
no
said
the
girl
i
m
not
she
took
her
grandfather
s
hand
besides
i
m
not
allowed
to
be
afraid
grandfather
and
i
have
a
big
job
to
do
over
here
on
black
we
re
in
for
the
duration
aren
t
we
grandpa
that
we
are
the
little
man
agreed
heartily
that
s
the
spirit
lieutenant
warren
exclaimed
we
ll
win
now
for
sure
after
betty
and
lena
had
been
introduced
they
all
took
the
winding
path
that
led
to
grandfather
norton
s
house
of
magic
as
norma
had
named
it
long
before
she
saw
it
chapter
xvii
those
bad
gremlins
this
house
of
magic
she
discovered
was
really
a
home
and
a
spotter
shed
combined
originally
it
had
been
a
summer
home
made
of
pine
logs
that
had
broken
from
a
jam
and
drifted
to
the
rocky
shore
of
black
knob
since
this
cabin
had
been
built
on
a
high
point
overlooking
the
sea
it
was
necessary
to
erect
only
a
tower
with
a
winding
stairway
this
led
up
from
the
front
porch
atop
this
tower
was
a
room
eight
feet
square
with
windows
on
every
side
outside
was
a
two
foot
walk
railed
in
which
gave
the
watcher
a
view
of
every
spot
on
the
island
and
on
a
clear
day
many
square
miles
of
sea
it
s
an
admirable
spot
for
a
lookout
lieutenant
warren
exclaimed
but
what
about
your
force
have
you
enough
to
do
a
really
good
job
the
little
old
man
hesitated
the
misses
morrison
jane
and
mildred
retired
school
teachers
of
uncertain
age
who
like
myself
have
come
to
love
the
privacy
of
this
rock
do
their
best
to
aid
me
but
jane
i
fear
is
becoming
hard
of
not
so
good
for
night
watching
the
lieutenant
smiled
oh
i
have
a
way
the
old
man
paused
studied
the
circle
of
eyes
about
him
then
ended
lamely
a
way
using
the
help
that
is
at
he
doesn
t
trust
us
norma
whispered
to
betty
at
least
not
all
of
she
glanced
at
lena
who
was
all
eyes
and
ears
he
was
going
to
tell
us
of
some
secret
hearing
device
betty
agreed
there
are
other
and
more
interesting
secrets
norma
half
confided
she
had
never
told
betty
of
the
talking
hands
if
there
are
betty
whispered
we
ll
have
to
wait
for
another
time
to
learn
about
at
that
moment
the
little
girl
came
dancing
up
pulling
norma
s
head
low
she
whispered
my
name
s
patsy
i
d
like
to
take
you
around
the
island
and
show
you
where
i
saw
the
oh
a
sub
norma
whispered
i
guess
you
must
have
imagined
that
no
a
really
truly
the
girl
pulled
at
her
hand
patsy
and
i
are
going
exploring
norma
explained
to
her
commander
quite
all
right
was
the
smiling
reply
if
you
sight
an
enemy
plane
let
us
norma
and
patsy
were
away
it
s
an
awful
little
island
patsy
said
as
they
marched
along
i
can
walk
clear
to
the
end
of
it
in
ten
then
it
won
t
take
us
long
norma
said
but
don
t
you
get
lonesome
here
she
asked
oh
no
there
are
three
fishermen
and
two
miss
morrisons
without
any
husbands
and
grandfather
and
all
the
good
gremlins
oh
there
are
a
lot
of
besides
she
added
a
moment
later
i
d
have
to
stay
here
anyway
daddy
s
an
officer
in
the
navy
and
momsie
s
helping
make
machine
guns
in
a
big
factory
she
makes
good
machine
guns
good
good
ones
no
bad
gremlin
can
keep
the
bullets
from
coming
out
of
her
machine
i
ll
bet
they
can
t
norma
said
seriously
grandfather
says
we
couldn
t
beat
our
enemies
at
all
if
it
wasn
t
for
the
women
of
i
m
sure
of
that
norma
agreed
again
they
were
passing
through
a
grove
of
pines
that
whispered
over
their
heads
that
s
the
bad
gremlins
a
note
of
mystery
crept
into
patsy
s
voice
they
re
fixing
up
a
storm
a
really
bad
storm
they
always
whisper
like
that
before
a
oh
then
we
had
better
hurry
norma
exclaimed
my
chum
betty
and
i
piloted
the
boat
it
s
neither
fast
nor
large
we
don
t
know
much
about
boats
so
we
wouldn
t
like
to
get
caught
in
a
oh
we
ll
get
back
before
they
are
through
talking
was
the
quick
reply
we
ll
hurry
you
just
must
see
black
head
gray
head
and
bald
illustration
oh
we
ll
get
back
before
they
are
through
who
are
they
people
no
they
re
huge
rocks
that
slant
away
into
the
sea
when
there
s
a
bad
storm
it
s
just
terrible
to
see
the
way
the
waves
come
roaring
in
when
that
sub
came
up
out
of
the
water
the
child
s
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
i
laid
right
down
on
black
head
hid
my
face
behind
a
little
that
was
a
wise
thing
to
had
this
child
really
seen
a
german
submarine
rise
close
to
this
island
norma
wondered
it
makes
it
all
seem
so
close
and
so
real
she
whispered
to
herself
there
they
are
the
child
cried
as
they
emerged
from
the
pines
that
s
black
she
pointed
that
s
gray
and
the
other
must
be
bald
head
norma
laughed
yes
and
right
out
there
was
where
the
sub
came
again
the
girl
pointed
come
on
seizing
her
companion
s
hand
she
dragged
her
along
at
a
furious
pace
right
here
she
said
vastly
excited
i
was
just
sitting
here
watching
for
planes
when
i
looked
suddenly
she
broke
off
there
came
the
whir
of
wings
and
then
just
before
them
in
the
water
at
the
foot
of
black
head
two
beautiful
eider
ducks
came
to
rest
going
north
patsy
whispered
the
first
ones
i
ve
seen
this
in
her
excitement
she
allowed
her
voice
to
rise
and
suddenly
the
ducks
were
gone
did
you
see
that
patsy
exclaimed
they
crash
dived
just
the
way
the
sub
did
only
it
didn
t
crash
dive
right
away
oh
no
you
can
t
think
how
scared
i
was
three
men
came
up
from
the
conning
tower
they
had
a
rubber
boat
and
were
blowing
it
coming
ashore
norma
whispered
yes
that
s
what
i
thought
and
was
i
scared
if
they
had
seen
me
they
would
have
shot
me
grandfather
would
have
heard
and
there
would
have
been
a
a
battle
oh
sure
we
can
fight
a
battle
a
real
battle
grandfather
has
two
you
ought
to
see
him
shoot
them
even
miss
jane
morrison
can
shoot
them
and
so
can
how
strange
all
this
seemed
to
norma
as
she
sat
there
in
the
glorious
sunshine
watching
the
eider
ducks
who
had
come
up
again
some
distance
away
why
did
they
crash
dive
she
asked
at
last
because
they
heard
a
plane
i
heard
it
too
it
was
coming
from
the
land
an
american
fighter
plane
i
can
tell
them
when
i
hear
them
yes
and
when
i
see
them
too
you
should
have
heard
those
men
on
the
sub
patsy
laughed
how
they
jabbered
they
went
down
below
then
they
crash
what
did
you
do
i
jumped
up
and
told
grandfather
and
he
told
beth
and
bess
and
they
told
the
fort
pretty
soon
there
were
just
lots
and
lots
of
planes
but
just
no
sub
at
too
bad
said
norma
but
how
did
your
grandfather
tell
beth
and
bess
shish
patsy
put
a
finger
to
her
lips
that
s
a
military
not
bad
for
a
norma
thought
she
ll
be
a
lady
soldier
some
of
a
sudden
the
calm
sea
appeared
to
have
been
lashed
by
ten
thousand
tiny
whips
then
there
came
a
race
of
a
million
tiny
waves
that
s
the
bad
gremlins
patsy
sprang
to
her
feet
they
are
whipping
the
sea
soon
the
sea
will
be
very
very
angry
and
let
s
go
i
ll
race
you
back
norma
exclaimed
now
get
set
one
two
three
go
they
were
away
like
a
flash
because
she
knew
a
short
cut
patsy
was
first
in
oh
good
here
you
are
lieutenant
warren
exclaimed
we
ve
been
thinking
of
starting
yes
yes
norma
panted
we
must
go
at
once
the
gremlins
are
whipping
the
water
she
broke
off
short
what
nonsense
she
thought
so
she
s
got
you
believing
in
the
gremlins
the
man
of
magic
chuckled
she
s
got
all
of
us
here
on
the
island
converted
to
belief
in
those
little
there
was
little
enough
to
make
anyone
believe
in
the
bad
gremlins
as
they
took
off
from
the
small
dock
now
and
then
little
flurries
of
wind
rose
and
raced
across
the
sea
that
was
all
betty
was
at
the
wheel
i
m
going
to
send
three
of
you
over
there
to
help
out
at
least
for
a
while
miss
warren
confided
to
norma
oh
i
m
glad
norma
exclaimed
it
s
really
not
safe
for
them
there
three
old
fishermen
an
aged
inventor
two
spinsters
and
a
and
if
you
were
there
you
would
protect
them
the
lieutenant
laughed
however
i
wasn
t
thinking
of
safety
but
of
the
rare
opportunity
they
have
for
airplane
spotting
of
course
she
added
after
a
moment
it
will
at
best
be
only
an
outpost
our
main
station
will
always
be
at
indian
if
her
superior
was
not
at
that
moment
thinking
of
the
possible
dangers
of
life
on
black
knob
norma
most
surely
was
after
recalling
patsy
s
words
she
thought
spies
have
been
landed
on
american
shores
from
submarines
and
may
try
again
black
knob
would
make
a
marvelous
hideout
if
at
that
moment
she
was
seeing
a
picture
of
herself
and
the
aged
inventor
standing
at
the
log
cabin
s
windows
that
were
like
and
firing
while
patsy
dragged
up
fresh
belts
of
ammunition
real
danger
replaced
her
dreams
and
that
in
a
very
short
time
for
as
if
by
magic
the
sea
began
rolling
in
a
most
alarming
manner
and
the
wind
began
to
tear
at
them
like
mad
can
t
hold
her
on
her
course
betty
panted
it
s
a
wind
and
every
wave
at
that
a
wave
larger
than
the
rest
came
splashing
across
the
deck
half
drowned
norma
sprung
to
her
feet
but
lena
was
before
her
crowding
betty
aside
she
seized
the
wheel
and
bracing
herself
like
a
veteran
she
brought
the
boat
about
to
head
it
squarely
into
the
storm
she
held
it
to
this
course
until
there
came
a
brief
lull
then
again
she
took
up
a
direct
course
toward
the
shore
the
lull
was
soon
the
wind
was
once
again
cracking
about
their
ears
and
the
boat
was
bouncing
like
a
cork
with
lips
set
in
a
straight
line
and
every
muscle
drawn
tight
as
a
bow
string
lena
braced
herself
for
the
task
that
lay
before
her
dark
clouds
engulfed
them
like
a
shroud
waves
reaching
for
the
boat
and
missing
gave
forth
hisses
as
they
broke
into
foam
suddenly
norma
s
lips
parted
for
a
scream
of
warning
the
scream
failed
a
fierce
gust
of
wind
drove
it
down
her
throat
before
them
so
close
it
seemed
they
could
not
miss
were
two
jagged
piles
of
gray
rock
like
the
jaws
of
a
giant
sea
serpent
she
told
herself
with
a
shudder
she
stole
a
look
at
lena
she
was
like
a
statue
her
strong
arms
were
rigid
one
moment
they
raced
toward
one
reef
the
next
they
had
whirled
half
about
and
were
racing
for
the
other
then
as
a
great
wave
white
with
foam
hit
them
they
were
lifted
high
to
be
shot
forward
in
a
mass
of
foam
made
it
norma
heard
the
astonishing
lena
murmur
it
became
apparent
at
once
that
this
reef
formed
a
barrier
that
held
the
water
back
for
once
across
it
they
found
themselves
in
calmer
waters
lena
s
answer
to
this
was
full
speed
ahead
and
not
one
of
them
dared
cry
lena
you
are
wrong
all
too
well
lieutenant
warren
who
had
spent
many
months
on
the
new
england
coast
knew
that
they
had
been
caught
in
one
of
those
brief
but
terrific
storms
that
from
time
to
time
ravage
the
coast
a
quarter
hour
passed
then
again
they
were
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
for
a
full
hour
after
that
never
flinching
nor
asking
for
quarter
the
stout
lena
held
to
her
post
until
with
a
deep
breath
that
was
half
groan
and
half
a
sigh
of
relief
she
slid
the
small
boat
into
the
narrow
slip
by
the
dock
here
behind
the
breakwater
they
were
safe
sergeant
tom
who
had
been
anxiously
awaiting
word
from
them
caught
the
line
lena
leaped
to
the
dock
then
drenched
as
she
was
by
cold
salt
water
spray
went
racing
for
harbor
bells
at
that
moment
words
were
running
through
norma
s
mind
the
words
of
a
child
the
bad
gremlins
do
as
she
trudged
up
the
hill
toward
the
spot
where
dry
clothes
a
roaring
open
fire
and
steaming
coffee
awaited
them
norma
said
to
her
lieutenant
lena
was
magnificent
yes
was
the
quiet
reply
we
all
have
our
big
moments
your
big
moment
too
will
arrive
perhaps
sooner
than
you
will
it
norma
asked
herself
there
was
no
answer
chapter
xviii
sudden
panic
when
norma
awoke
a
half
hour
before
her
regular
time
next
morning
it
was
with
the
feeling
of
one
who
has
had
her
little
world
of
thought
turned
it
is
lena
who
has
done
it
she
told
herself
yet
she
could
not
hate
lena
for
that
it
is
not
easy
to
hate
any
person
who
in
the
past
hours
has
saved
your
life
lena
she
was
sure
had
done
just
that
neither
she
nor
betty
could
have
brought
the
boat
safely
home
through
that
storm
and
yet
when
she
had
seen
lena
in
the
big
living
room
the
night
before
after
dinner
and
had
tried
to
thank
her
lena
had
shrugged
mumbling
something
about
all
in
a
day
s
work
and
handled
a
boat
before
then
had
walked
away
you
d
think
she
was
a
man
norma
had
said
to
betty
later
that
s
the
way
men
we
ve
given
her
rather
a
cold
shoulder
was
betty
s
quiet
comment
it
wouldn
t
be
surprising
if
she
paid
us
back
in
cold
well
norma
had
started
to
reply
perhaps
we
had
reasons
she
had
gone
no
farther
and
appearing
to
understand
betty
had
not
encouraged
her
to
continue
but
life
with
lena
has
been
strange
she
told
herself
now
yes
there
had
been
the
whispered
words
on
that
first
night
at
fort
des
moines
lena
s
apparent
friendship
with
the
spanish
hairdresser
and
that
startling
affair
of
the
door
at
night
in
a
des
moines
repair
shop
then
too
she
had
quite
recently
heard
a
man
at
the
back
of
the
photographer
s
studio
say
you
must
and
had
heard
a
voice
which
she
was
sure
must
be
lena
s
say
i
will
not
that
lena
was
there
at
the
photographer
s
studio
at
one
time
or
another
was
certain
for
a
picture
had
been
taken
there
for
her
identification
card
but
why
not
norma
whispered
now
almost
fiercely
what
did
she
norma
have
against
that
photographer
he
was
undoubtedly
a
german
yet
there
were
hundreds
of
thousands
of
loyal
he
looked
like
her
mental
picture
of
a
spy
she
had
heard
lieutenant
warren
tell
about
yet
her
mental
picture
of
that
spy
of
india
might
be
all
wrong
she
had
never
seen
him
both
these
men
were
photographers
yet
there
were
many
like
them
in
the
world
both
kept
black
pigeons
she
didn
t
know
a
great
deal
about
pigeons
so
for
all
she
knew
there
might
be
a
million
black
ones
in
america
even
the
spanish
hairdresser
had
not
been
convicted
of
espionage
she
had
disappeared
from
fort
des
moines
that
was
all
some
woman
with
a
spanish
look
had
showed
up
at
night
at
the
sea
tower
with
a
faked
identification
card
and
dressed
in
a
wac
uniform
but
was
this
the
spanish
hairdresser
who
could
answer
that
question
this
brought
her
around
to
the
missing
picture
from
her
film
developed
by
carl
langer
that
was
a
picture
of
the
spanish
hairdresser
she
assured
herself
the
film
for
it
is
still
in
his
studio
and
i
am
going
to
have
it
even
if
i
have
to
break
in
and
steal
at
that
she
sprang
out
of
bed
and
raced
for
the
showers
this
she
recalled
with
sudden
thrill
was
their
last
day
of
training
and
probation
today
for
the
last
time
she
would
sit
for
eight
hours
with
sergeant
tom
mccarthy
at
her
elbow
making
sure
that
she
marked
on
her
chart
the
exact
spot
where
an
airplane
had
been
spotted
and
seeing
to
it
that
she
checked
correctly
with
the
representative
of
the
army
navy
and
civil
aeronautics
authority
to
make
sure
that
the
plane
really
belonged
where
it
had
been
spotted
tomorrow
she
told
herself
i
ll
be
there
all
alone
doing
my
ah
yes
and
that
was
not
all
rosa
betty
millie
lena
and
all
the
rest
would
be
there
at
their
appointed
hours
and
ten
sturdy
young
men
would
oil
up
their
guns
and
go
marching
off
did
these
boys
like
it
some
she
knew
were
raring
to
go
and
some
would
have
been
glad
to
stay
for
they
were
after
all
very
human
what
they
want
doesn
t
matter
now
she
thought
grimly
at
the
major
s
dance
held
in
the
big
dining
hall
at
harbor
bells
she
had
enjoyed
their
lively
fun
working
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
them
in
the
sea
tower
she
had
come
to
know
them
better
than
she
knew
her
fellow
wacs
yes
she
would
miss
them
one
consolation
was
that
sergeant
tom
mccarthy
was
not
leaving
he
had
serious
work
to
do
here
for
in
the
narrow
harbor
between
docks
was
a
seaplane
called
in
this
plane
sergeant
tom
did
patrol
duty
and
if
occasion
demanded
could
do
his
bit
at
hunting
out
an
enemy
plane
to
shower
its
pilot
with
fire
or
drop
a
bomb
on
a
prowling
sub
today
however
since
it
was
saturday
and
she
had
an
afternoon
off
she
was
planning
a
land
adventure
none
other
than
obtaining
by
hook
crook
or
downright
the
film
showing
the
spanish
hairdresser
little
wonder
then
that
try
as
she
might
she
missed
the
exact
spot
in
her
chart
for
a
reported
plane
and
got
her
ears
not
too
playfully
boxed
by
sergeant
tom
in
the
end
however
tom
gave
her
an
a
rating
and
she
was
all
ready
for
the
big
step
forward
a
wac
in
the
active
service
of
her
country
it
was
a
bright
brisk
day
an
inch
of
snow
had
fallen
the
day
before
cars
had
swept
the
snow
from
the
roads
the
night
before
it
had
frozen
hard
in
the
bright
sunlight
the
valleys
hills
trees
and
forests
were
all
aglitter
a
grand
day
for
taking
pictures
norma
exclaimed
as
she
and
betty
hurried
home
for
lunch
i
m
going
for
a
long
long
bike
wish
i
could
go
with
you
betty
sighed
but
i
just
must
catch
up
with
my
letter
writing
i
have
a
hunch
that
i
m
going
to
be
sent
over
to
black
knob
for
a
while
there
getting
off
letters
won
t
be
so
i
d
be
glad
to
have
just
such
a
hunch
myself
i
like
that
little
girl
and
her
grandfather
was
norma
s
reply
and
the
bad
gremlins
i
have
an
idea
that
lieutenant
warren
has
other
plans
for
you
betty
said
slowly
something
like
making
you
second
in
command
a
sergeant
perhaps
then
there
ll
be
two
sergeants
she
laughed
tom
and
norma
that
will
be
grand
and
will
we
tell
you
where
to
get
off
norma
s
eyes
shone
but
just
you
wait
a
while
for
that
it
won
t
be
long
now
betty
chanted
look
norma
s
voice
dropped
that
photographer
over
at
granite
head
held
out
one
of
my
he
did
he
certainly
did
the
one
of
that
spanish
hairdresser
at
fort
des
you
don
t
betty
stared
no
i
don
t
think
anything
but
i
m
going
to
have
that
picture
if
i
have
to
lose
an
arm
getting
don
t
be
rash
betty
warned
it
s
not
worth
who
knows
norma
murmured
thoughtfully
she
was
still
weighing
this
question
when
she
arrived
at
the
studio
at
granite
head
as
she
entered
the
studio
she
found
carl
langer
talking
excitedly
to
an
elderly
fisherman
s
wife
the
woman
s
face
bronzed
by
many
winds
and
seamed
by
many
a
care
was
she
thought
most
attractive
carl
langer
was
saying
in
a
harsh
tone
no
madam
i
can
not
take
your
picture
i
am
too
busy
and
one
print
bah
that
is
not
enough
i
would
lose
it
is
for
my
the
woman
s
voice
was
low
pleading
it
is
for
my
only
son
he
is
a
soldier
fighting
in
soldier
bah
the
photographer
s
eyes
bulged
there
are
many
million
soldiers
and
most
times
they
are
this
last
norma
knew
was
not
true
her
face
flushed
but
she
said
never
a
word
until
the
woman
was
gone
then
she
said
you
don
t
know
a
picture
when
you
see
one
how
is
that
carl
langer
scowled
if
you
had
seated
that
woman
on
a
log
put
a
sea
scene
behind
her
and
given
her
a
net
to
mend
you
might
have
had
a
carl
langer
shot
her
a
look
but
said
never
a
word
mr
langer
she
said
after
a
moment
a
while
back
you
kept
some
of
my
to
make
some
prints
they
were
very
fine
pictures
i
gave
you
some
yes
that
was
generous
of
that
was
nothing
nothing
the
photographer
s
chest
swelled
you
forgot
to
give
me
my
films
she
suggested
that
is
true
wait
i
shall
bring
he
hurried
to
the
back
room
it
s
no
use
trying
to
get
the
spanish
hairdresser
s
picture
today
she
told
herself
he
s
in
an
explosive
the
films
she
had
asked
for
showed
cozy
white
new
england
village
a
boy
bringing
in
wood
and
a
rare
shot
of
a
deer
deep
in
the
forest
drinking
from
a
pool
at
the
foot
of
a
tiny
waterfall
here
they
he
handed
her
an
envelope
that
s
fine
now
sell
me
three
films
and
i
ll
be
off
for
another
afternoon
of
you
lady
soldiers
he
laughed
you
are
the
who
knows
she
murmured
she
was
seeing
a
little
man
and
a
girl
standing
at
the
window
of
a
log
cabin
on
black
knob
island
with
on
their
knees
here
are
the
films
and
good
shooting
to
you
he
laughed
he
wouldn
t
say
that
if
he
could
read
my
thoughts
she
told
herself
having
paid
for
her
films
she
stepped
once
more
into
the
crisp
air
after
wrapping
her
camera
and
new
films
in
her
utility
coat
and
placing
them
in
the
bike
basket
she
paused
to
examine
the
old
films
he
had
given
her
there
are
four
instead
of
three
she
thought
with
a
start
then
without
knowing
why
she
pocketed
the
films
and
rode
rapidly
away
did
she
hear
a
distant
shout
while
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
road
she
did
not
look
back
she
peddled
for
a
mile
or
more
along
the
shore
road
and
entered
a
small
fishing
village
she
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
fisherwoman
turn
up
the
path
leading
to
her
own
door
wait
a
minute
she
called
the
woman
waited
will
you
allow
me
to
take
your
picture
she
asked
as
she
came
close
the
woman
looked
at
the
girl
s
uniform
for
a
moment
then
as
a
smile
spread
over
her
wrinkled
face
she
said
you
are
one
of
them
wacs
a
lady
soldier
yes
miss
take
as
many
as
you
like
fer
my
son
he
is
a
soldier
i
ll
take
two
for
you
and
one
for
me
norma
replied
cheerily
you
must
send
one
to
your
son
in
he
shall
have
them
both
said
the
woman
tidying
up
her
faded
dress
norma
posed
her
before
her
cottage
then
down
by
the
seashore
we
ll
say
a
prayer
tonight
asking
that
your
son
may
come
back
safely
she
said
in
a
low
quiet
tone
and
may
the
good
lord
bless
you
said
the
woman
see
said
norma
taking
the
envelope
of
films
from
her
pocket
i
can
take
as
good
pictures
as
carl
langer
ever
made
and
they
won
t
cost
you
a
she
very
nearly
dropped
the
first
film
she
held
to
the
light
it
was
a
good
clear
picture
of
the
spanish
hairdresser
standing
by
the
gate
at
fort
des
moines
did
carl
langer
mean
to
give
me
that
film
she
asked
herself
as
she
left
the
fishing
village
she
doubted
it
he
probably
had
put
the
film
in
the
envelope
by
mistake
or
had
forgotten
it
was
there
she
took
a
long
long
ride
that
day
she
seemed
to
hear
more
than
once
when
she
thought
of
turning
back
the
good
gremlins
urging
her
to
go
on
at
last
having
circled
a
row
of
hills
she
turned
once
more
toward
the
sea
and
there
just
before
her
nestling
on
a
sloping
hillside
and
half
hidden
by
pines
that
stood
out
black
against
the
snow
was
the
most
charming
colonial
home
she
had
ever
seen
it
was
a
large
house
shapely
white
pillars
adorned
its
broad
porch
there
were
three
great
chimneys
a
fireplace
in
every
room
she
thought
how
old
and
perfectly
charming
it
must
back
of
the
house
was
a
red
barn
with
three
white
cupolas
on
the
roofs
of
the
cupolas
were
many
pigeons
all
black
pigeons
she
thought
with
a
start
just
then
the
bark
of
a
dog
startled
her
the
broad
door
to
the
house
had
opened
three
large
dogs
had
come
dashing
out
their
master
called
them
back
she
was
glad
for
a
moment
she
had
been
terribly
frightened
she
took
one
more
look
at
the
house
the
barn
the
dogs
and
their
master
then
in
sudden
panic
she
turned
squarely
about
leaped
on
her
bicycle
and
peddled
back
over
the
way
she
had
come
the
man
with
the
three
dogs
by
the
door
of
that
lovely
house
was
carl
langer
the
photographer
she
still
had
that
film
he
had
tried
to
hide
from
her
but
there
were
other
causes
for
her
sudden
panic
pictures
were
playing
back
and
forth
in
her
mind
and
she
was
hearing
lieutenant
warren
telling
of
the
man
in
india
who
had
been
shot
as
a
spy
first
it
is
carl
langer
who
looks
like
that
spy
then
he
acts
like
that
spy
he
steals
my
film
he
refuses
to
take
honest
people
s
pictures
he
keeps
black
pigeons
and
now
i
find
him
at
his
own
rich
estate
back
in
the
hills
it
s
too
much
far
too

did
not
slacken
her
speed
until
she
reached
the

road
when
she
passed
through
granite
head
lamps
were
being
lighted
on
coming
to

caught

up
there

cheer

sprang
from

into
a
chair
tea
a
kind
word
and
a
you
shall
have
all
three
beth
declared
and
you
surely
deserve
it
patsy
told
me
all
about
your
wild
ride
on
the
sea
those
bad
gremlins
nearly
got
you
that
patsy
is
she
over
here
norma
asked
no
not
here
was
the
reply
she
too
can
talk
with
her
hands
just
as
soon
as
she
told
me
with
those
expressive
hands
of
hers
that
you
were
out
in
the
storm
i
got
on
the
wire
and
stayed
there
until
i
knew
you
were
that
was
kind
of
norma
felt
that
she
surely
was
making
warm
friends
probably
i
shall
need
them
she
told
herself
bess
went
outside
to
take
up
her
spotter
s
post
when
tea
was
served
they
passed
her
a
big
steaming
cup
after
eating
delicious
homemade
cakes
and
thin
sandwiches
with
her
tea
norma
felt
ready
once
more
for
journey
and
battle
i
ll
be
going
now
she
stood
up
and
thank
you
a
don
t
go
yet
beth
begged
we
ll
have
a
little
chat
with
patsy
and
perhaps
with
grandfather
though
he
s
often
prowling
about
the
island
at
this
hour
looking
for
subs
she
laughed
after
dragging
both
a
television
camera
and
receiving
set
from
cabinets
beth
watched
the
clock
for
a
short
time
then
set
things
humming
half
a
minute
later
a
pair
of
tiny
hands
appeared
in
the
square
of
light
and
began
to
talk
patsy
is
here
norma
whispered
beth
nodded
here
and
ten
miles
away
isn
t
it
strange
she
watched
those
hands
and
at
the
same
time
wrote
down
letters
one
by
one
she
says
grandfather
has
been
gone
for
an
hour
and
she
s
a
little
bit
i
shouldn
t
wonder
said
norma
with
a
shake
of
the
head
he
takes
too
many
chances
beth
said
soberly
can
you
talk
to
her
norma
asked
illustration
tea
is
just
what
i
need
said
oh
sure
watch
soon
with
the
television
camera
trained
upon
them
beth
s
hands
were
twisting
themselves
in
all
manners
of
strange
forms
tell
her
i
m
here
said
norma
again
beth
s
hands
talked
across
ten
miles
of
black
waters
then
it
was
little
patsy
s
time
to
talk
the
words
fairly
flew
from
her
nimble
fingers
she
says
she
loves
you
beth
laughs
she
hopes
you
ll
come
often
but
oh
is
she
glad
the
bad
gremlins
didn
t
get
you
that
other
night
she
s
a
dear
said
norma
i
only
wish
i
were
going
there
to
live
for
a
time
but
i
m
a
little
afraid
that
is
too
bad
i
m
sure
patsy
d
love
it
you
d
have
experiences
you
d
not
looks
as
if
i
might
have
unforgettable
experiences
anyway
norma
laughed
nervously
she
was
thinking
of
the
spanish
hairdresser
of
carl
langer
and
all
the
strange
surprises
that
had
come
to
her
i
ll
tell
lieutenant
warren
all
about
it
very
soon
she
told
herself
again
patsy
was
talking
it
was
an
animated
and
joyous
conversation
they
held
with
patsy
while
bess
stood
watch
outside
then
of
a
sudden
all
was
changed
patsy
broke
off
short
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
her
tiny
hands
disappeared
and
in
their
stead
were
larger
older
hands
grandfather
beth
whispered
as
if
afraid
he
might
hear
and
is
he
excited
soon
enough
they
knew
there
was
reason
for
excitement
the
trembling
hands
spelled
out
the
words
rapidly
one
by
one
mile
off
help
norma
sprang
for
the
telephone
taking
down
the
receiver
she
tried
to
speak
calmly
distinctly
speaking
at
her
words
seemed
to
tremble
black
knob
reports
submarine
half
mile
off
shore
send
at
that
instant
bess
thrust
her
head
in
at
the
door
to
report
one
single
off
black
knob
coming
this
way
moderate
at
that
same
instant
millie
who
was
standing
watch
on
the
top
of
the
sea
tower
took
a
frosty
telephone
from
its
hiding
place
and
called
down
to
betty
one
single
about
six
miles
off
shore
looks
like
coming
from
black
knob
coming
west
moderate
at
once
betty
got
in
touch
with
the
men
below
in
ten
seconds
she
had
her
answer
no
plane
due
to
be
at
that
point
wait
for
second
the
second
report
came
not
from
norma
at
granite
point
spotter
shed
but
from
a
fisherman
s
wife
at
the
village
which
norma
had
visited
a
few
hours
before
on
receiving
the
report
sergeant
tom
sprang
up
the
stairs
to
stand
at
millie
s
side
and
add
his
keen
listening
ears
to
hers
circling
as
if
for
a
landing
was
his
first
comment
mighty
strange
a
small
plane
way
out
there
at
this
hour
of
the
night
it
s
not
any
american
plane
i
ve
ever
heard
i
m
going
out
there
tell
betty
to
notify
the
rock
point
airfield
tell
her
to
give
the
going
down
the
stairs
he
all
but
fell
over
rosa
who
was
just
going
off
duty
oh
tom
she
exclaimed
are
you
going
after
that
plane
looks
like
i
tom
bounded
out
into
the
uncertain
light
of
night
there
was
no
moon
rosa
who
was
right
at
his
heels
called
in
a
low
eager
voice
tom
take
me
with
you
what
a
lady
it
can
t
be
done
i
m
a
soldier
i
ll
handle
the
and
the
machine
gun
too
i
suppose
he
grumbled
yes
and
that
too
tom
please
take
me
she
pleaded
when
the
seagull
rose
from
the
dark
sea
rosa
rode
in
the
second
seat
tom
had
extracted
from
her
a
promise
of
absolute
secrecy
that
was
all
there
was
reason
enough
why
norma
s
report
of
the
plane
and
the
sub
had
not
come
in
the
phone
at
the
granite
head
spotter
shed
was
dead
beyond
a
doubt
the
wires
had
been
cut
while
they
were
finding
this
out
beth
had
received
a
more
complete
report
from
her
grandfather
he
had
been
hearing
sounds
from
the
sea
for
a
full
half
hour
someone
was
working
on
a
motor
or
some
other
thing
at
first
he
thought
some
fisherman
s
boat
was
stalled
as
the
craft
was
carried
in
by
the
tide
he
caught
words
spoken
in
german
then
he
made
out
the
long
low
bulk
of
the
sub
now
he
was
telling
of
a
mysterious
plane
that
had
appeared
from
just
nowhere
and
was
soaring
out
over
the
sea
i
ve
got
my
bike
norma
exclaimed
excitedly
i
ll
ride
like
mad
be
at
the
sea
tower
in
no
time
at
all
she
was
away
at
once
as
norma
sped
down
those
winding
stairs
she
was
thinking
of
the
old
man
and
the
child
out
there
on
black
knob
and
their
great
peril
those
men
were
rigging
out
a
boat
she
told
herself
they
were
going
ashore
on
the
island
and
she
coasted
down
the
hill
at
a
terrific
speed
only
a
miracle
saved
her
from
a
crash
at
the
bottom
she
got
her
crash
all
the
same
having
covered
a
quarter
of
the
distance
to
the
sea
tower
she
rounded
a
curve
when
to
her
consternation
she
saw
a
figure
all
in
white
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
swinging
as
far
as
she
could
to
the
right
she
attempted
to
pass
when
with
an
astonishing
leap
the
figure
landed
upon
the
back
of
her
bicycle
and
wrapped
long
arms
about
her
instantly
they
went
down
in
a
heap
it
s
a
spy
she
thought
he
cut
the
wire
now
he
means
to
stop
me
but
he
won
summoning
all
her
courage
and
drawing
heavily
on
her
feeling
of
sudden
desperation
she
threw
all
her
strength
into
tearing
away
those
arms
the
ease
with
which
this
was
done
astonished
her
those
were
not
strong
arms
they
seemed
to
be
the
arms
of
a
woman
norma
s
escape
was
she
discovered
not
to
be
so
easy
her
opponent
was
surprisingly
fast
no
sooner
were
her
arms
free
than
she
was
gripped
by
both
ankles
and
thrown
with
a
crash
to
the
ground
at
last
struggling
to
a
sitting
position
she
pushed
the
creature
away
and
sprang
up
leaping
like
a
panther
her
enemy
landed
on
her
back
to
send
her
crashing
once
again
i
ve
got
to
be
cool
the
girl
told
herself
this
may
be
a
fight
to
the
when
once
again
she
found
herself
on
her
feet
she
began
sparring
like
a
boxer
then
seeing
an
opening
she
seized
her
opponent
by
one
arm
hanging
on
desperately
with
both
hands
she
started
whirling
finding
her
assailant
surprisingly
light
she
at
last
swung
her
off
her
feet
three
more
dizzy
turns
then
she
let
go
the
white
figure
crashed
into
the
bank
ten
feet
away
without
looking
back
norma
seized
her
bike
mounted
and
rode
away
at
terrific
speed
in
the
meantime
tom
and
rosa
were
out
over
the
sea
first
they
headed
for
the
spot
where
the
plane
had
last
been
heard
they
circled
in
an
ever
growing
spiral
but
discovered
nothing
switching
on
a
light
tom
looked
back
at
rosa
the
look
on
her
round
face
betrayed
no
sign
of
fear
instead
there
was
a
look
of
grim
determination
we
ll
climb
he
spoke
into
his
phone
it
may
be
okay
by
me
rosa
called
back
cheerfully
we
ll
get
up
high
then
i
ll
shut
off
my
motor
and
glide
then
you
listen
with
both
your
with
both
my
ears
came
echoing
back
they
climbed
then
they
began
a
silent
glide
out
to
rosa
s
ears
had
caught
the
sound
of
a
motor
near
the
island
i
think
black
knob
you
know
tom
had
heard
too
they
were
away
over
black
knob
they
circled
again
no
soap
tom
grumbled
you
much
scared
he
asked
not
scared
at
want
to
turn
on
the
searchlight
and
sweep
the
sky
as
we
circle
he
asked
they
may
see
us
and
shoot
that
may
mean
curtains
for
but
if
it
s
an
enemy
scout
plane
from
an
aircraft
carrier
this
was
the
girl
s
answer
then
it
is
curtains
for
many
and
rosa
snapped
on
the
light
after
that
as
they
circled
low
over
the
water
a
pencil
of
light
searched
the
sky
now
and
then
the
girl
played
the
light
on
dark
waters
looking
for
the
aircraft
carrier
tom
thought
she
s
sure
got
what
it
suddenly
rosa
exclaimed
look
what
s
that
what
where
it
was
on
the
water
not
big
but
long
and
a
fishing
boat
perhaps
said
tom
they
re
coming
in
from
the
banks
these
mebby
yes
mebby
no
was
the
odd
reply
truth
was
they
had
sighted
the
sub
but
since
norma
s
report
had
failed
they
knew
nothing
of
that
sub
so
they
circled
on
norma
you
re
a
sight
betty
cried
as
her
pal
at
last
stumbled
into
their
sea
tower
watchroom
did
you
have
a
crash
crash
norma
murmured
half
in
a
daze
but
betty
quick
notify
the
airfield
there
s
an
enemy
submarine
to
black
knob
re
trying
to
land
i
think
will
be
terrible

squadron
of
planes

on
the
way
now
betty
said
told
them
about
the
sub
norma
stared
not
the
sub
betty
corrected
there
is
an
unidentified
oh

then
tell
them
to
send
out
planes
to
look
for
the
betty
got
off
the
message
while
norma
collapsed
into
a
chair
here
drink
this
betty
offered
her
a
cup
of
steaming
coffee
oh
betty
norma
exclaimed
it
was
terrible
i
tried
to
call
from
the
spotter
shed
but
the
wires
were
cut
i
started
coming
here
like
mad
on
my
bike
someone
attacked
attacked
you
threw
me
off
my
bike
had
a
terrible
fight
it
was
a
woman
or
a
boy
in
a
white
snow
suit
woman
i
think
the
spanish
hairdresser
i
shouldn
t
wonder
the
spanish
hairdresser
betty
s
eyes
opened
wide
have
her
norma
dug
into
the
pocket
of
her
coat
s
gone
she
gasped
it
was
the
spanish
hairdresser
the
picture
was
what
she
wanted
lost
the
fight
after
not
by
a
long
way
betty
declared
stoutly
if
she
s
around
here
we
ll
get
her
yet
wait
she
held
up
a
hand
then
listened
five
more
planes
going
out
we
ll
get
that
chapter
xx
patsy
watches
three
shadows
once
again
tom
mccarthy
and
rosa
climbed
to
the
upper
sky
where
the
stars
seemed
to
reach
down
for
them
and
the
air
was
bitter
cold
now
tom
muttered
hoarsely
as
he
shut
off
the
motor
and
they
started
on
a
spiral
glide
listen
listening
came
in
a
hoarse
whisper
at
first
no
sound
reached
their
listening
ears
then
they
caught
a
low
indistinct
roar
like
the
approach
of
an
storm
a
terrible
storm
rosa
seemed
a
little
frightened
that
s
no
storm
tom
s
voice
was
husky
it
s
the
roar
of
lots
of
lots
of
planes
rosa
repeated
they
come
from
an
airplane
carrier
they
will
fly
to
portland
boston
perhaps
new
york
who
knows
tom
s
eyes
were
on
his
instruments
they
were
still
spiraling
rapidly
darn
he
murmured
scowling
fiercely
where
was
the
sea
to
strike
it
meant
death
at
night
sky
and
sea
look
alike
and
yet
he
wanted
to
listen
to
get
the
direction
of
that
squadron
at
that
moment
he
saw
himself
at
the
controls
with
rosa
manning
the
machine
gun
surrounded
by
enemy
fighters
shooting
by
them
in
the
night
it
was
a
fantastic
but
not
impossible
scene
suddenly
a
single
flash
of
light
appeared
beneath
them
one
instant
it
was
there
the
next
it
was
gone
rosa
quick
the
spotlight
he
pulled
the
plane
up
so
short
that
blood
rushed
to
rosa
s
head
and
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
she
set
the
light
playing
on
the
water
one
frightened
look
down
and
she
gasped
they
were
all
but
upon
the
water
and
going
like
the
wind
one
more
short
pull
and
their
ship
leveled
off
it
was
then
that
their
spot
of
light
gliding
swiftly
across
the
water
revealed
a
secret
their
light
crossed
a
long
low
craft
with
a
tower
at
its
center
sub
tom
shouted
but
already
it
was
too
late
to
drop
a
bomb
they
were
over
it
and
gone
instantly
he
began
to
climb
not
very
high
this
time
perhaps
ten
thousand
feet
then
again
silence
the
roar
of
distant
motors
was
louder
now
but
even
louder
and
closer
at
hand
sounded
a
single
motor
that
s
the
enemy
plane
tom
muttered
after
listening
with
all
his
senses
he
changed
the
direction
of
his
plane
and
they
went
shooting
away
at
full
speed
tom
was
flying
by
sense
of
direction
alone
a
dangerous
business
in
the
night
ten
long
minutes
he
stuck
to
his
course
then
after
climbing
once
more
he
shut
off
the
motor
and
began
to
glide
huh
he
grunted
we
had
that
plane
s
course
to
a
t
but
they
re
fast
they
ve
gone
straight
out
to
then
we
can
t
catch
up
with
them
rosa
asked
never
they
go
back
to
europe
that
s
impossible
plane
s
too
small
to
carry
enough
then
the
ocean
will
get
no
chance
tom
grumbled
they
ll
keep
a
secret
meeting
with
that
sub
realizing
that
his
supply
of
gas
would
not
carry
him
much
further
and
allow
them
to
fly
back
tom
put
his
motor
in
motion
and
very
reluctantly
turned
back
at
that
moment
hidden
by
the
night
and
the
shadow
of
a
great
rock
patsy
and
her
grandfather
sat
huddled
in
the
cold
at
the
foot
of
bald
head
listening
and
straining
their
eyes
for
some
sight
or
sound
from
the
sea
that
was
tom
mccarthy
in
the
seaplane
the
grandfather
whispered
yes
and
that
other
plane
that
was
an
enemy
plane
said
patsy
i
hope
the
good
gremlins
will
pack
its
wings
with
ice
until
it
falls
into
the
sea
but
for
us
said
the
grandfather
the
sub
is
more
important
yes
they
might
land
the
child
answered
and
crowded
close
let
them
come
came
in
a
low
even
tone
we
ll
take
care
of
he
patted
the
on
his
knee
patsy
placed
a
finger
on
his
lips
her
young
ears
were
sharper
than
his
had
she
caught
the
low
murmur
of
voices
she
could
not
be
quite
sure
people
talking
she
whispered
after
a
moment
of
intent
listening
another
moment
of
breathless
silence
and
then
sounds
like
water
the
old
man
gripped
his
gun
tight
old
for
her
years
patsy
knew
this
meant
a
boat
of
one
sort
or
another
without
saying
a
word
she
glided
down
the
slope
of
bald
head
until
her
face
was
a
scant
two
yards
from
the
water
that
gently
lapped
the
shore
then
dropping
flat
on
her
stomach
she
looked
straight
out
across
the
dark
surface
of
the
sea
if
a
boat
was
out
there
it
would
show
against
the
dull
gray
of
the
night
sky
a
full
five
minutes
passed
without
a
sound
then
she
whispered
back
not
a
boat
but
three
men
sitting
on
the
a
rubber
boat
without
a
sound
the
grandfather
slid
down
the
dock
to
her
side
then
bidding
her
lie
quite
still
he
put
his
gun
across
her
slender
body
she
did
not
flinch
he
could
see
the
men
there
were
three
or
four
of
them
they
came
slowly
shoreward
pausing
now
and
then
to
rest
afraid
the
girl
said
yes
of
a
trap
was
the
all
but
inaudible
answer
grandfather
was
thinking
slowly
carefully
weighing
the
wisdom
of
laying
a
volley
across
the
spot
in
the
sea
they
could
be
friends
he
whispered
we
ll
wait
perhaps
they
will
speak
then
we
ll
so
they
waited
and
while
they
waited
the
low
roar
of
many
planes
began
beating
on
their
eardrums
oh
patsy
squirmed
in
fear
if
these
are
enemy
planes
from
a
they
ll
not
bomb
black
knob
was
the
cheering
assurance
they
only
drop
bombs
where
there
are
many
listen
he
ended
see
if
you
can
get
their
once
again
save
for
the
occasional
of
a
paddle
silence
hung
over
black
knob
suddenly
after
gripping
the
old
man
s
arm
with
intense
eagerness
the
girl
whispered
grandfather
those
planes
are
coming
from
the
south
from
rocky
point
airfield
they
should
have
started
sooner
something
must
have
gone
wrong
but
now
will
there
be
a
battle
the
child
was
trembling
all
over
i
don
t
know
shall
you
shoot
out
there
we
must
wait
and
see
was
the
calm
reply
always
in
a
slow
whisper
we
can
not
afford
a
horrible
and
so
with
the
roar
beating
ever
louder
in
their
ears
they
lay
there
not
daring
to
move
the
man
and
the
child
as
for
the
shadowy
figures
sitting
on
the
water
they
too
must
have
heard
for
there
came
no
longer
the
of
their
paddles
tom
and
rosa
too
were
being
cheered
by
the
ever
increasing
roar
we
ll
leave
that
sub
to
them
tom
said
through
the
speaker
we
can
t
have
much
more
than
enough
gas
to
take
us
at
last
they
circled
low
dropped
to
the
surface
inside
the
breakwater
at
indian
point
then
taxied
in
the
instant
the
motor
stopped
and
tom
had
secured
a
tie
line
he
said
in
a
low
tone
this
is
our
secret
rosa
to
anyone
else
you
just
didn
t
go
with
okay
was
the
frank
agreement
grab
that
skiff
and
row
as
fast
as
you
can
to
the
dock
but
you
will
come
too
the
girl
demurred
not
yet
he
lifted
her
into
the
skiff
don
t
you
see
you
little
goose
if
you
come
back
for
me
then
it
will
all
be
quite
regular
you
just
happened
along
and
gave
me
a
i
the
girl
rowed
swiftly
away
when
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
rosa
still
fairly
shaking
with
cold
but
managing
a
casual
stride
for
all
that
walked
into
the
big
living
room
norma
exclaimed
rosa
where
have
you
been
they
have
looked
for
you
everywhere
i
went
out
for
a
little
fresh
air
that
s
norma
studying
rosa
s
face
whispered
little
rosa
has
one
more
and
little
rosa
that
still
the
old
man
and
the
child
lay
in
the
darkness
on
the
great
rock
feeling
the
sound
of
motors
growing
louder
ever
louder
in
their
ears
still
the
old
man
s
fingers
trembled
as
they
gripped
the
gun
that
might
have
spelled
death
to
those
shadowy
forms
on
the
black
waters
at
last
the
girl
whispered
they
re
paddling
again
i
can
hear
them
will
they
come
ashore
now
will
you
shoot
grandfather
if
they
come
ashore
i
will
still
quite
breathless
the
child
lay
quiet
tensing
as
she
lost
the
sound
of
the
paddles
the
roar
of
motors
drowned
it
out
as
her
eyes
searched
the
waters
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
shadowy
forms
were
fading
then
she
lost
interest
in
the
sea
for
coming
like
the
wind
were
airplanes
good
american
planes
they
re
coming
to
drive
the
horrible
sub
and
all
the
bad
gremlins
away
she
whispered
she
wanted
to
leap
to
her
feet
and
scream
hurrah
hurrah
for
our
planes
but
she
dared
not
the
planes
were
not
looking
for
the
sub
they
had
been
sent
out
to
find
an
enemy
plane
as
if
by
magic
a
gray
mist
came
sweeping
in
from
the
sea
it
s
the
bad
she
spoke
aloud
at
last
they
have
hidden
those
men
the
men
on
the
sub
have
made
a
fog
to
hide
them
was
the
grandfather
s
reply
even
the
airplanes
will
not
find
the
sub
come
he
lifted
her
up
we
must
go
back
to
the
cabin
you
are
freezing
we
will
listen
there
you
may
talk
with
your
grandfather
she
said
as
she
trotted
beside
him
will
the
sub
come
back
perhaps
another
and
then
will
you
shoot
at
those
shadows
on
the
water
yes
if
i
know
they
are
our
enemies
i
will
little
patsy
did
not
talk
with
her
hands
that
night
for
after
drinking
a
big
cup
of
hot
chocolate
and
being
wrapped
in
two
warm
blankets
she
curled
up
on
the
broad
couch
and
fell
fast
asleep
it
was
the
grandfather
who
with
his
hands
spelled
out
their
story
to
beth
and
bess
the
faithful
watchers
at
the
granite
head
spotter
tower
and
all
the
while
the
searching
planes
roared
on
in
the
night
chapter
xxi
night
for
a
spy
story
and
norma
too
was
on
the
it
was
one
of
those
nights
when
one
does
not
wish
to
sleep
the
air
was
full
of
sounds
of
airplanes
roaring
in
close
ashore
then
speeding
away
to
sea
there
were
wild
tales
going
the
rounds
of
the
village
as
norma
went
there
for
a
walk
there
would
be
an
invasion
of
america
spies
were
being
landed
all
along
the
coast
from
subs
i
heard
said
a
fisherman
that
one
of
them
lady
soldiers
a
waac
do
they
call
them
was
beat
to
death
on
the
road
from
granite
as
norma
listened
in
on
this
bit
of
conversation
she
smiled
she
beyond
doubt
was
that
lady
it
all
went
to
show
how
stories
grew
as
they
traveled
or
does
it
she
asked
with
a
start
perhaps
someone
is
starting
these
wild
tales
to
frighten
us
if
that
s
it
she
squared
her
shoulders
they
ve
got
a
long
way
to
as
she
returned
to
harbor
bells
she
found
herself
in
a
mood
for
talking
telling
tales
confiding
in
someone
and
there
sitting
alone
by
the
fire
as
if
she
had
been
waiting
for
her
sat
lieutenant
warren
it
s
a
wild
night
she
said
as
norma
dropped
into
a
seat
beside
her
yes
a
strange
night
it
seems
to
bring
the
war
so
very
close
to
america
the
lieutenant
agreed
it
s
a
night
for
a
ghost
yes
or
a
spy
story
norma
replied
quickly
lieutenant
warren
i
ve
discovered
your
german
spy
from
india
right
here
in
what
why
that
s
impossible
the
officer
sat
straight
up
to
stare
at
her
he
was
shot
as
a
spy
two
years
ago
in
india
are
you
sure
did
your
friend
really
say
your
photographer
friend
was
shot
well
now
lieutenant
warren
went
into
a
brown
study
perhaps
not
just
that
she
did
say
that
a
photographer
who
had
a
studio
facing
the
parade
supposed
he
was
the
one
i
it
might
not
be
let
me
tell
you
all
about
norma
s
voice
dropped
as
she
moved
her
chair
close
from
outside
came
the
roar
of
a
motor
that
slowly
faded
away
he
calls
himself
carl
langer
norma
said
that
wasn
t
the
name
but
it
s
easy
to
take
a
new
name
most
spies
do
i
guess
lieutenant
warren
said
i
saw
him
the
very
first
night
we
were
here
norma
went
on
i
went
out
for
a
look
at
the
moon
and
the
sea
and
there
he
stood
by
the
gate
with
a
camera
in
his
oh
is
he
a
photographer
here
too
lieutenant
warren
s
voice
rose
a
bit
yes
of
course
and
a
very
good
one
his
hair
stands
up
the
way
it
does
on
a
pig
s
back
only
it
s
scrubbed
and
shines
white
his
face
is
lined
but
is
round
and
what
a
remarkable
resemblance
rita
warren
murmured
but
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
any
of
this
before
i
wanted
to
be
sure
norma
said
i
could
not
accuse
people
of
course
lieutenant
warren
said
but
listen
you
haven
t
heard
anything
norma
warmed
to
her
subject
he
has
a
grand
pose
didn
t
want
to
do
my
snapshots
for
me
said
he
couldn
t
waste
his
time
and
and
you
i
said
you
wouldn
t
be
wasting
your
money
because
i
mean
to
pay
you
at
that
they
both
laughed
oh
it
s
been
like
doing
a
part
in
a
play
norma
exclaimed
just
as
if
i
had
been
drilled
in
advance
for
every
act
and
did
he
do
your
pictures
for
you
of
course
but
miss
suddenly
norma
s
face
grew
tense
he
held
out
on
me
he
kept
the
one
i
took
of
the
spanish
hairdresser
at
fort
des
illustration
i
had
to
be
sure
before
accusing
the
spanish
hairdresser
yes
don
t
you
remember
her
she
and
lena
seemed
to
be
great
friends
she
did
lena
s
hair
for
her
every
other
day
and
i
doubt
if
she
always
was
paid
for
it
i
followed
her
and
unthinkingly
norma
raced
on
followed
them
yes
in
des
why
i
don
t
know
why
i
just
did
that
s
all
they
went
into
a
dark
repair
shop
on
a
spooky
side
street
i
followed
them
in
and
the
door
closed
behind
me
it
locked
itself
i
couldn
t
get
girl
alive
rita
warren
exclaimed
sharply
you
might
have
been
murdered
yes
norma
drew
in
a
deep
breath
yes
but
i
wasn
what
happened
some
man
gripped
my
arm
he
seemed
very
angry
then
suddenly
he
changed
and
was
very
why
because
he
knew
i
was
a
but
you
said
it
was
dark
it
guess
he
knew
me
by
the
fine
wool
in
my
coat
that
s
one
time
when
it
really
paid
to
wear
my
it
may
have
saved
your
life
was
the
lieutenant
s
slow
comment
he
wouldn
t
have
dared
harm
a
wac
not
in
des
moines
that
would
have
brought
the
town
down
on
his
head
but
wait
rita
warren
s
voice
rose
as
she
continued
how
does
lena
fit
into
the
picture
why
did
this
carl
langer
hold
out
your
picture
of
this
spanish
hairdresser
or
did
he
perhaps
the
shot
was
no
good
that
often
it
didn
t
happen
this
norma
s
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
he
gave
the
film
to
me
by
mistake
this
very
day
i
got
a
look
at
it
that
s
let
s
have
another
we
can
t
norma
whispered
someone
in
a
white
snow
suit
waylaid
me
on
the
coast
road
and
took
it
from
me
after
a
fight
a
fight
and
how
norma
s
voice
carried
conviction
this
sounds
interesting
and
rather
rita
warren
was
impressed
tell
me
the
rest
tell
me
more
of
fritz
kurnsen
i
mean
your
carl
langer
fritz
was
my
spy
in
india
it
would
be
really
ridiculous
to
think
they
were
the
same
he
was
shot
i
m
sure
yes
that
s
what
you
the
words
were
on
norma
s
lips
but
she
did
not
say
them
instead
she
said
let
me
yes
carl
langer
is
very
selfish
and
doesn
t
work
any
more
than
he
has
to
he
refused
to
take
a
picture
of
a
poor
fisherwoman
and
she
wanted
to
send
the
picture
to
her
son
in
the
service
over
in
he
would
rita
warren
agreed
that
is
if
he
were
fritz
kurnsen
but
tell
me
about
this
fight
with
the
norma
told
her
in
a
dramatic
manner
she
described
the
entire
battle
that
s
bad
the
lieutenant
exclaimed
so
they
cut
the
wires
to
the
spotter
s
shed
they
must
the
war
comes
closer
to
us
every
day
i
must
put
sperry
the
fbi
agent
on
the
tracks
of
these
people
at
but
lena
the
words
slipped
out
unbidden
lena
must
look
out
for
rita
warren
s
words
were
spoken
in
tones
cold
as
ice
we
are
in
a
war
if
lena
has
been
associating
with
spies
if
she
s
been
doing
wrong
things
she
must
suffer
for
but
it
s
not
been
proven
not
then
there
s
rosa
norma
said
quietly
rosa
is
she
in
on
this
too
don
t
know
just
tonight
she
came
in
after
she
had
been
away
a
long
time
with
a
strange
secretive
look
on
her
face
and
back
at
fort
des
moines
there
was
her
flashing
of
light
at
night
and
the
crazy
thing
she
did
at
the
tell
norma
told
of
the
flashing
lights
and
rosa
s
book
of
prayers
that
sounds
innocent
enough
said
rita
warren
i
hoped
you
d
say
that
but
the
airplane
story
is
well
sort
of
norma
told
of
the
time
rosa
had
come
very
close
to
running
away
with
a
secret
fighter
plane
what
in
the
world
made
her
do
that
rita
warren
exclaimed
when
the
story
was
finished
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
norma
seemed
troubled
then
she
exclaimed
oh
i
m
sorry
i
told
you
i
never
wanted
to
suspect
anyone
of
doing
anything
wrong
it
s
all
right
your
telling
me
was
the
reply
about
carl
langer
yes
norma
exclaimed
in
a
low
tense
voice
he
s
a
pig
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
flatters
me
i
hate
him
but
lena
and
s
her
voice
dropped
rosa
s
been
a
good
sport
and
a
regular
pal
and
she
practically
saved
our
lives
in
that
you
forget
that
she
was
at
the
same
time
saving
her
own
of
course
but
lieutenant
warren
norma
s
voice
rose
there
is
still
more
to
be
told
about
carl
langer
let
s
hear
it
he
keeps
black
pigeons
they
roost
on
his
studio
roof
and
today
she
caught
her
breath
today
i
went
for
a
long
ride
up
into
the
hills
and
what
do
you
suppose
i
saw
an
estate
all
surrounded
with
palms
with
your
carl
langer
standing
at
the
door
rita
warren
laughed
the
picture
is
norma
did
not
laugh
only
instead
of
palms
there
were
huge
pine
trees
standing
out
against
the
snow
even
the
dogs
were
there
three
of
beasts
and
the
pigeons
were
on
the
barn
roof
lots
of
and
you
went
up
to
the
door
and
said
carl
langer
please

me
your
ancient
i
jumped
on
my
bicycle
and
peddled

as
fast
as

i
could
i
was
scared
scared
to
the
tips
of
my
the
picture

remarkable
coincidence

volunteers

the
re

this
spy
business

must
look
into

you
of
course

we
re
all
soldiers
and
must
serve
where
we
can
do
the
most
good
of
course
norma
added
with
a
touch
of
longing
it
would
be
nice
to
live
there
a
while
with
that
fine
old
grandfather
the
imp
of
a
child
and
all
the
good

m
planning
to
send

head

mary

girls

to
help

like
a
busy
time
ahead
norma
laughed
you
don
t
know
the
half
of
it
lieutenant
warren
agreed
as
they
parted
for
the
night
the
clock
on
the
mantel
struck
slowly
twelve
times
midnight
norma
whispered
slipping
out
on
the
porch
the
stars
were
shining
bright
the
moon
was
just
rising
back
of
black
knob
all
the
planes
had
gone
home
the
night
seemed
very
still
had
she
been
able
to
look
in
at
windows
at
black
knob
as
the
good
gremlins
do
she
might
have
seen
the
grandfather
and
child
fast
asleep
while
on
the
spotter
tower
a
woman
walked
slowly
back
and
forth
and
in
a
warm
corner
downstairs
two
rough
fishermen
guns
at
hand
nodded
sleepily
keeping
watch
just
in
as
norma
turned
to
go
in
she
whispered
lieutenant
warren
said
she
would
go
with
me
to
langer
s
place
but
not
tomorrow
i
hope
she
makes
it
chapter
xxii
flight
of
the
black
pigeon
i
m
going
to
miss
you
terribly
norma
said
to
betty
as
they
all
gathered
at
the
fisherman
s
wharf
next
day
wish
you
were
going
along
to
black
knob
said
betty
i
know
it
s
going
to
be
loads
of
fun
and
there
might
be
a
thrill
or
two
who
knows
thrills
norma
shuddered
she
had
not
fully
recovered
from
the
shock
of
being
sat
upon
by
a
figure
in
the
dark
every
muscle
in
her
body
ached
and
there
were
three
long
scratches
on
her
cheek
tell
me
all
about
it
when
you
get
to
work
she
whispered
drawing
betty
to
one
side
tell
you
betty
exclaimed
why
my
voice
doesn
t
carry
that
far
no
but
your
hands
there
was
a
note
of
secrecy
in
norma
s
voice
they
have
a
wonderful
way
of
talking
to
the
folks
on
shore
from
over
ah
a
mystery
betty
exclaimed
in
a
whisper
just
that
norma
agreed
sorry
i
can
t
tell
you
more
but
they
ll
tell
you
more
when
they
learn
to
trust
you
and
that
will
be
very
soon
i
m
sure
goodbye
and
good
she
gripped
betty
s
hand
hard
watch
out
for
the
bad
gremlins
and
give
my
love
to
okay
i
betty
sprung
into
the
motorboat
and
they
were
away
norma
returned
to
harbor
bells
to
sit
by
the
fire
for
a
long
time
thinking
and
dreaming
then
to
eat
her
dinner
and
retire
for
a
few
hours
of
sleep
her
shift
at
the
sea
tower
for
the
present
was
to
be
the
wee
small
hours
of
the
morning
the
most
important
of
all
had
been
lieutenant
warren
s
words
for
it
it
is
during
these
hours
that
thieves
housebreakers
and
prowl
a
city
s
streets
that
ghosts
walk
and
spies
fly
the
skies
or
creep
beneath
the
and
that
the
bad
gremlins
get
in
their
dirty
work
norma
laughed
in
spite
of
their
fun
norma
knew
that
the
task
she
was
undertaking
was
a
serious
one
rosa
and
a
girl
named
marie
were
to
work
with
her
but
she
was
to
be
in
charge
when
at
last
norma
took
her
place
at
the
chart
table
with
rosa
at
the
switchboard
and
marie
ready
for
any
task
that
might
come
her
way
there
was
a
sober
look
on
her
face
such
as
had
seldom
been
there
before
two
hours
passed
norma
s
eyelids
were
growing
heavy
the
first
night
was
going
to
be
hard
then
the
switchboard
rattled
and
norma
repeated
after
some
voice
two
heavy
going
south
fast
that
s
from
kittywake
said
rosa
norma
searched
her
chart
then
marked
a
spot
while
marie
was
droning
through
a
phone
two
heavy
going
south
fast
that
s
from
okay
stand
by
came
back
in
a
man
s
voice
a
moment
later
the
switchboard
again
rattled
and
once
more
rosa
repeated
two
heavy
going
south
that
s
from
brink
s
point
she
said
this
time
norma
marked
the
spot
and
marveled
at
the
distance
that
had
been
covered
if
they
re
enemy
planes
she
chilled
and
thrilled
at
the
thought
of
a
sky
battle
before
marie
got
in
her
second
report
there
came
a
buzz
and
the
man
s
voice
from
below
reported
those
are
army
planes
of
the
ferry
command
a
little
off
their
course
but
they
ll
take
care
of
that
as
you
they
all
settled
back
to
await
the
night
s
next
little
adventure
at
a
small
plane
was
reported
off
crow
point
it
turned
out
to
be
a
navy
patrol
plane
that
had
lost
its
way
in
an
early
morning
mist
a
few
moments
later
a
wavering
light
was
reported
off
preston
beach
the
watcher
said
it
was
six
miles
off
shore
it
was
really
only
one
mile
and
was
a
lantern
atop
the
mast
of
a
fishing
schooner
and
that
was
the
total
bag
of
missing
misled
and
enemy
planes
not
so
exciting
was
marie
s
sleepy
comment
as
they
went
off
duty
no
norma
agreed
but
standing
guard
at
the
edge
of
no
man
s
land
when
nothing
happens
for
months
on
end
over
there
on
the
other
side
isn
t
exciting
either
but
let
the
patrol
and
then
comes
rosa
finished
yes
and
if
we
relax
it
will
come
here
said
norma
look
at
last
night
okay
marie
agreed
when
it
comes
you
ll
find
me
right
here
with
you
and
i
ll
hope
to
do
my
i
know
you
will
said
norma
with
a
friendly
grip
on
the
arm
that
first
night
might
have
served
for
the
whole
week
s
pattern
and
for
another
half
week
after
that
a
plane
lost
and
found
three
planes
off
their
course
a
fast
speed
boat
taken
for
a
plane
these
were
the
simple
little
stories
recorded
in
norma
s
book
but
for
all
that
they
were
learning
their
tasks
going
through
their
work
with
greater
skill
every
day
preparing
themselves
for
any
and
events
that
lay
ahead
that
is
not
to
say
that
in
this
week
and
a
half
nothing
exciting
happened
many
things
did
happen
but
these
came
during
hours
one
day
with
tom
mccarthy
as
her
escort
norma
peddled
back
to
carl
langer
s
studio
her
excuse
for
coming
was
to
leave
an
unimportant
film
to
be
developed
her
real
reason
to
talk
to
carl
langer
about
his
estate
up
in
the
hills
mr
langer
she
said
after
the
film
had
been
listed
and
stored
away
that
s
a
fine
farm
you
have
back
in
the
the
photographer
started
and
stared
so
you
have
seen
he
regained
his
composure
instantly
he
didn
t
see
me
on
my
bike
she
thought
oh
yes
she
said
i
rode
up
that
far
on
my
that
farm
he
said
swelling
a
little
with
pride
occupies
all
my
spare
time
i
am
particularly
fond
of
it
because
it
belonged
to
my
father
before
me
you
see
his
voice
took
on
a
conversational
tone
i
was
born
in
portland
my
father
was
a
man
of
business
this
farm
was
for
him
you
might
say
a
sideline
he
kept
a
man
to
farm
it
he
spent
there
i
too
enjoyed
it
when
i
was
a
boy
so
now
you
he
smiled
it
brings
me
great
that
s
quite
wonderful
said
norma
and
did
your
father
also
raise
black
pigeons
black
pigeons
it
seemed
to
norma
that
carl
langer
started
again
but
once
more
he
made
a
quick
recovery
pigeons
oh
is
something
i
have
done
these
pigeons
they
are
quite
i
thought
they
were
said
norma
oh
rare
indeed
i
only
wish
you
had
come
in
when
you
were
by
my
house
gladly
would
i
have
shown
you
the
choicest
ones
of
the
lot
and
besides
i
have
something
i
should
wish
to
show
you
it
is
in
the
house
a
picture
it
is
a
masterpiece
i
picture
norma
s
voice
cracked
there
it
is
she
thought
but
i
must
not
betray
oh
a
picture
she
exclaimed
a
fine
i
d
love
to
see
it
and
i
have
a
friend
who
is
very
much
interested
in
pictures
but
then
she
s
a
very
important
and
busy
surely
she
must
not
be
too
busy
to
look
at
a
masterpiece
i
truly
think
it
is
by
millet
the
man
who
painted
the
oh
then
i
m
sure
she
would
come
said
norma
she
s
a
lover
of
millet
s
work
his
characters
are
so
simple
so
human
and
ah
i
see
you
also
know
a
little
norma
admitted
bring
your
friend
out
any
time
just
any
the
photographer
s
face
fairly
beamed
i
ll
bring
her
some
time
norma
agreed
what
s
all
this
about
a
masterpiece
tom
asked
on
the
way
home
i
don
t
get
oh
that
norma
laughed
low
that
s
a
sort
of
military
secret
between
my
big
high
chief
and
myself
when
when
the
story
breaks
you
might
say
i
ll
try
to
let
you
in
on
it
but
for
the
present
mum
s
the
have
it
your
own
way
tom
grinned
but
see
here
sister
if
you
go
out
to
that
old
geezer
s
house
don
t
go
alone
take
that
from
me
i
don
t
like
his
looks
i
won
t
norma
agreed
that
night
on
lonely
black
knob
island
betty
had
a
rather
weird
experience
to
make
life
safer
for
the
plane
spotters
on
the
island
six
enlisted
men
had
been
sent
there
these
had
taken
up
their
quarters
in
a
small
summer
hotel
that
had
been
closed
for
the
winter
betty
millie
and
mary
were
given
rooms
at
the
norton
cabin
but
took
their
meals
at
the
hotel
which
was
presided
over
by
pearl
tratt
a
busy
friendly
fisherman
s
wife
in
no
time
at
all
betty
had
won
her
way
into
the
hearts
of
patsy
and
her
grandfather
on
this
particular
night
betty
was
sharing
the
first
spotter
watch
with
grandfather
norton
and
patsy
who
had
not
yet
retired
for
the
night
since
the
moon
was
not
up
it
was
quite
dark
on
the
spotter
stand
grandfather
norton
who
had
already
begun
teaching
betty
the
deaf
and
dumb
alphabet
so
she
could
talk
to
norma
by
hand
was
now
introducing
her
to
a
device
which
he
had
been
working
on
for
a
long
time
it
s
not
yet
perfect
he
explained
but
i
think
it
has
great
possibilities
with
the
unaided
ear
one
seldom
spots
a
plane
by
sound
more
than
six
miles
away
even
with
my
imperfect
hearing
aided
by
my
listening
device
i
have
been
able
more
than
once
to
spot
a
plane
coming
from
the
sea
american
planes
of
course
at
a
distance
of
ten
miles
want
to
try
it
he
asked
of
course
was
betty
s
instant
reply
anything
that
helps
us
do
our
job
well
is
just
swell
well
now
said
grandfather
norton
this
listening
device
of
mine
appears
to
work
best
on
sounds
rather
close
at
hand
so
we
ll
just
try
it
out
on
joe
tratt
just
you
put
on
these
earphones
then
i
ll
turn
on
the
electricity
got
a
small
electric
plant
in
the
furnace
room
you
joe
betty
repeated
what
s
he
going
to
do
stand
off
somewhere
and
shout
the
old
inventor
s
voice
cracked
joe
always
comes
in
from
setting
his
nets
out
on
the
reef
about
this
time
he
s
coming
in
now
probably
only
his
boat
s
motor
doesn
t
make
a
great
deal
of
noise
so
you
don
t
hear
him
with
the
unaided
ear
ready
he
touched
a
button
a
faint
light
appeared
he
put
his
hand
on
a
large
metal
horn
and
began
turning
it
slowly
when
you
pick
up
the
sound
of
a
motor
say
now
he
shouted
for
ten
seconds
she
listened
intently
then
suddenly
she
said
now
i
ll
test
he
swung
it
back
and
forth
as
the
sound
of
the
boat
s
motor
rose
and
fell
with
the
turning
betty
told
him
by
lifting
and
lowering
a
hand
how
the
sound
rose
and
fell
when
at
last
the
spot
was
found
where
the
sound
was
strongest
she
held
both
hands
straight
out
it
s
like
tuning
in
on
a
radio
program
she
laughed
as
she
continued
to
listen
this
should
be
great
i
only
wish
there
were
an
airplane
coming
oh
they
ll
come
the
old
man
crackled
perhaps
sooner
than
you
want
as
she
listened
the
sound
of
the
motor
grew
steadily
louder
coming
in
she
thought
then
she
wondered
what
it
would
be
like
setting
nets
off
the
shores
of
the
british
isles
where
many
subs
lurked
and
planes
like
birds
of
prey
haunted
the
skies
ready
to
pounce
down
upon
you
brave
people
she
thought
they
deserve
all
that
we
can
do
for
tiring
of
the
constant
pounding
on
her
eardrums
she
nodded
to
patsy
at
the
same
time
executing
a
circle
with
her
hand
understanding
instantly
patsy
began
turning
the
big
horn
slowly
gradually
the
sound
of
the
motor
faded
into
nothing
for
a
time
betty
caught
only
the
slow
wash
wash
of
waves
on
the
shore
then
little
by
little
she
began
to
make
out
a
different
sound
at
first
only
a
low
like
clothes
cracking
on
a
distant
clothesline
the
sound
at
last
became
a
steady
that
increased
in
volume
with
each
second
i
hear
she
made
a
motion
to
patsy
and
the
girl
stopped
turning
it
s
a
bad
flying
patsy
danced
up
and
down
in
her
excitement
a
seagull
said
the
more
practical
grandfather
the
speaker
picked
up
their
voices
betty
heard
them
it
s
not
like
a
gull
s
flight
she
said
i
ve
heard
them
too
often
this
is
something
see
patsy
danced
again
i
told
you
it
s
a
gremlin
a
bad
bad
then
oh
she
covered
her
eyes
i
don
t
want
to
see
him
he
may
come
real
we
ll
put
the
spotlight
on
him
said
grandfather
taking
up
a
portable
spotlight
and
adjusting
a
switch
he
s
coming
right
this
way
said
betty
he
should
pass
over
i
ll
be
ready
with
the
light
said
grandfather
you
tell
me
in
the
dim
light
patsy
s
face
was
a
strange
study
alternating
curiosity
and
fear
curiosity
at
last
won
the
day
when
at
last
the
searchlight
cut
across
the
sky
she
was
watching
and
eager
for
ten
seconds
the
light
played
across
an
empty
sky
and
then
it
is
a
gremlin
patsy
cried
a
big
black
gremlin
no
said
betty
i
m
sorry
it
s
a
black
pigeon
i
didn
t
know
you
kept
we
don
t
said
grandfather
what
s
more
he
doesn
t
belong
on
this
island
he
s
going
straight
on
turn
the
horn
about
patsy
obeyed
and
once
again
betty
heard
that
steady
flap
flap
of
wings
when
the
horn
had
been
properly
adjusted
she
listened
until
the
sound
of
the
pigeon
s
flight
faded
into
nothing
for
a
moment
grandfather
norton
studied
the
pointing
horn
then
he
said
that
s
a
homing
carrier
pigeon
the
rookery
he
is
seeking
is
somewhere
near
granite
head
you
may
have
made
a
very
important
don
t
understand
said
betty
that
pigeon
never
came
all
this
way
from
shore
by
himself
that
s
not
the
way
of
then
you
think
he
came
from
a
boat
betty
was
beginning
to
understand
yes
or
from
an
or
a
patsy
put
in
any
of
these
or
even
an
airplane
carrier
which
means
grandfather
went
on
that
somewhere
on
the
mainland
we
have
a
nest
of
oh
yes
spies
betty
murmured
she
was
thinking
of
her
talks
with
norma
about
many
strange
doings
there
might
be
something
to
it
after
all
she
concluded
they
re
up
to
something
said
grandfather
sending
messages
back
and
forth
like
that
perhaps
it
s
something
really
big
just
now
they
re
just
feeling
us
out
trying
to
see
how
well
prepared
we
they
got
a
sample
the
other
night
said
betty
a
very
fine
sample
the
aged
inventor
agreed
a
very
fine
sample
indeed
what
i
fear
most
is
that
they
may
make
this
island
a
stepping
we
have
some
soldiers
now
betty
suggested
yes
a
few
men

ll
have
more

the
seagull
the
next
day
on
the
mainland
norma
visited
a
place
of
many
wonders
perfected
some
plans
was
treated
to
a
great
surprise
and
made
an
interesting
discovery
all
in
one
afternoon
norma
and
rosa
retired
as
soon
as
their
late
night
vigil
was
ended
by
they
were
up
and
ready
for
a
prowl
they
struck
off
on
foot
over
the
road
leading
to
the
fort
on
the
ridge
that
overlooked
their
village
harbor
bells
and
the
sea
tower
they
had
gone
but
a
little
way
when
tom
mccarthy
overtook
them
in
a
jeep
hop
in
he
invited
after
stopping
his
car
i
ll
give
you
a
lift
where
you
bound
for
nowhere
in
particular
was
norma
s
reply
as
they
all
crowded
into
the
front
seat
we
re
out
for
fresh
i
m
going
up
to
the
fort
tom
said
there
s
going
to
be
a
little
target
practice
by
the
big
guns
i
want
to
see
how
good
they
think
we
ll
need
their
help
some
of
these
days
norma
asked
half
jokingly
well
now
you
never
can
tom
did
not
laugh
there
seems
to
be
a
difference
of
opinion
some
think
america
may
be
invaded
at
least
by
the
and
others
think
it
won
t
said
norma
that
s
right
tom
agreed
me
i
m
keeping
my
fingers
oh
tom
rosa
broke
in
take
us
to
the
fort
i
d
just
love
to
see
you
re
on
your
way
right
now
tom
assured
her
at
least
you
ll
see
the
target
practice
at
a
distance
and
that
s
really
something
but
the
fort
that
s
different
too
many
secrets
in
there
it
takes
a
terrific
pull
to
get
i
ll
bet
it
s
a
spooky
place
rosa
exclaimed
oh
absolutely
was
the
quick
reply
built
right
out
of
solid
rock
it
would
take
some
bomb
to
smash
into
a
half
hour
later
they
found
themselves
standing
on
a
sloping
hillside
gazing
out
to
sea
and
at
norma
s
side
was
a
handsome
young
artillery
major
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
norma
found
herself
wishing
she
had
remained
behind
at
fort
des
moines
for
officer
s
training
an
officer
may
not
date
a
private
in
the
wacs
no
matter
how
bright
and
attractive
she
may
be
for
all
that
even
a
major
can
show
just
any
attractive
young
lady
who
happens
to
visit
his
camp
the
proper
degree
of
interest
and
respect
due
her
and
major
fairchild
was
not
one
to
neglect
this
duty
he
explained
that
the
large
square
far
out
on
the
water
was
not
a
sail
but
a
target
that
it
was
being
towed
on
a
long
cable
by
a
small
motorboat
some
distance
from
it
he
also
assured
her
that
those
huge
guns
poking
their
black
barrels
from
the
hillside
would
soon
speak
and
that
when
they
did
speak
she
would
do
well
to
plug
up
her
ears
some
ten
minutes
later
he
said
now
the
target
is
in
such
a
long
way
off
norma
murmured
it
s
as
far
as
black
knob
island
rosa
exclaimed
just
about
the
same
tom
mccarthy
agreed
we
can
blow
the
top
off
black
knob
any
time
we
care
to
said
major
fairchild
please
don
t
try
it
norma
begged
half
laughing
i
ve
got
a
good
pal
over
there
a
very
are
all
wacs
the
major
teased
my
pal
betty
is
was
the
prompt
reply
that
s
not
all
her
folks
are
rich
her
father
owns
a
war
plant
they
have
a
florida
estate
a
yacht
and
all
that
and
she
s
a
wac
the
major
whistled
illustration
a
major
can
show
interest
in
an
attractive
why
not
norma
s
voice
rose
it
s
our
war
we
re
all
in
it
one
woman
gave
up
a
a
year
job
to
join
the
wacs
we
have
several
girls
who
won
the
de
driving
ambulances
before
france
fell
yes
and
some
of
the
girls
joined
us
because
their
young
husbands
died
at
pearl
harbor
or
north
africa
don
t
you
think
that
s
really
wonderful
i
salute
the
major
fairchild
saluted
the
girl
and
she
returned
it
in
proper
form
and
he
was
not
joking
either
she
could
read
that
in
his
eyes
and
then
tom
mccarthy
said
get
ready
there
s
the
signal
they
are
about
to
the
major
pressed
balls
of
cotton
into
norma
s
hand
put
these
in
your
ears
then
take
he
held
out
a
pair
of
powerful
field
glasses
watch
the
target
see
if
they
miss
your
eyes
are
as
good
as
the
terrific
flash
and
the
roar
of
the
big
gun
together
made
the
rocks
shudder
norma
felt
her
knees
tremble
but
she
held
her
glasses
on
the
target
and
was
rewarded
by
a
black
spot
that
appeared
almost
as
if
by
magic
on
the
white
square
good
almost
perfect
she
exclaimed
a
little
to
the
right
that
s
all
and
how
far
from
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
major
asked
almost
on
the
sea
was
the
quick
response
this
is
important
said
the
young
major
it
meant
that
this
shot
would
have
destroyed
a
submarine
if
it
had
been
in
the
place
of
the
target
norma
suggested
good
girl
go
to
the
head
of
the
class
he
exclaimed
give
the
credit
to
my
father
she
replied
modestly
he
was
a
major
in
the
last
war
he
knows
a
great
deal
and
since
i
was
his
only
son
he
taught
me
about
oh
then
we
belong
to
the
same
tribe
exclaimed
the
major
my
father
was
an
officer
too
very
often
officers
are
born
and
not
made
you
too
will
be
an
officer
in
when
i
m
made
an
officer
she
said
with
a
proud
smile
i
ll
bring
my
bars
to
you
and
you
shall
pin
them
on
my
that
he
said
will
be
a
privilege
and
an
they
invited
me
to
stay
in
des
moines
and
train
in
the
officer
s
school
she
stated
in
a
tone
and
why
not
he
asked
i
wanted
some
actual
service
well
you
re
getting
he
smiled
and
unless
i
read
the
signs
wrong
you
are
going
to
get
your
experience
in
overdoses
from
now
oh
do
you
think
so
i
m
sure
of
it
there
are
things
i
can
t
tell
you
keep
your
eyes
and
ears
wide
open
and
don
t
miss
any
bets
you
ll
get
your
bars
sooner
than
you
think
and
now
he
handed
her
the
glasses
again
plug
up
your
ears
here
they
this
time
she
took
things
more
calmly
but
the
hit
was
hard
to
spot
right
at
the
water
s
edge
she
exclaimed
at
last
getting
better
that
s
real
sub
but
if
the
sub
comes
in
the
night
she
suggested
then
you
ll
have
to
get
out
there
in
a
plane
and
spot
the
sub
for
us
with
a
that
said
tom
with
a
grin
is
my
and
i
ll
fly
the
plane
for
you
rosa
volunteered
you
fly
my
plane
tom
gave
vent
to
a
roaring
laugh
rosa
s
face
crimsoned
for
a
time
she
did
not
speak
then
in
a
slow
even
tone
she
said
try
me
all
right
i
this
time
tom
did
not
laugh
all
right
rosa
tom
said
when
their
jeep
drew
up
to
the
fisherman
s
dock
off
which
the
seagull
lay
at
anchor
the
plane
is
yours
if
you
can
fly
you
don
t
mean
that
norma
said
in
a
low
tone
as
tom
bent
over
to
untie
his
skiff
sure
i
do
he
replied
promptly
give
everyone
a
chance
to
show
what
he
can
do
that
s
my
motto
climb
in
the
back
seat
is
wide
enough
for
you
and
me
we
ll
have
rosa
for
our
sky
norma
hung
back
come
on
he
urged
i
ll
guarantee
that
no
harm
will
come
of
ten
minutes
later
norma
found
herself
beside
tom
in
the
rear
seat
lines
had
been
cast
off
and
rosa
was
warming
up
the
motor
norma
uneasy
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
she
noticed
that
tom
too
could
work
the
controls
from
where
he
sat
as
they
taxied
out
from
behind
the
dock
norma
noted
that
the
water
was
a
bit
rough
but
she
clenched
her
hands
and
said
never
a
word
the
motor
began
to
roar
in
earnest
behind
them
raced
the
white
foam
the
plane
appeared
to
skip
from
wave
to
wave
then
tom
said
up
and
up
they
rose
climbing
steadily
they
rose
a
thousand
feet
two
three
four
five
six
thousand
there
above
the
bumpy
clouds
the
plane
leveled
off
and
they
headed
straight
for
black
knob
tom
looked
first
at
rosa
then
at
norma
then
he
grinned
as
he
formed
the
words
with
his
lips
great
stuff
before
they
knew
it
they
were
over
black
knob
and
soaring
down
for
a
landing
near
the
tiny
dock
and
harbor
the
water
was
calm
with
real
skill
rosa
taxied
the
ship
right
to
the
dock
where
they
were
greeted
with
joyous
shouts
by
betty
millie
mary
grandfather
patsy
and
all
the
rest
norma
betty
exclaimed
when
the
two
were
alone
rosa
wasn
t
really
flying
the
plane
was
she
she
certainly
was
norma
s
tone
was
impressive
she
took
off
climbed
high
spiraled
down
and
all
the
rest
then
that
what
norma
asked
oh
a
lot
of
norma
s
mind
was
too
busy
to
carry
this
thought
through
for
as
they
wandered
over
the
island
she
felt
like
a
general
looking
over
a
battlefield
where
the
enemy
might
attack
on
the
morrow
she
noted
low
spots
among
the
rocks
where
men
might
land
from
a
plane
or
a
rubber
boat
tried
to
find
the
marks
of
high
tide
and
studied
with
great
care
the
narrow
beach
beside
the
harbor
why
was
she
doing
all
this
perhaps
she
could
not
have
told
herself
she
just
did
that
was
all
after
a
delicious
lunch
served
at
the
small
hotel
that
had
been
made
a
barracks
they
prepared
for
the
return
trip
again
rosa
took
the
controls
and
once
more
she
made
a
perfect
it
was
growing
dusk
now
and
as
they
circled
above
the
island
norma
turned
on
the
spotlight
allowing
it
to
play
upon
the
dark
clusters
of
pines
the
gray
rocks
and
the
cottage
roofs
she
was
astonished
to
see
how
clearly
everything
stood
out
an
enemy
plane
could
bomb
it
to
bits
she
said
sure
but
why
tom
asked
it
s
an
outpost
and
so
dangerous
to
approaching
enemy
ships
or
you
mean
it
could
be
tom
corrected
just
now
the
few
who
are
here
could
perhaps
protect
the
island
itself
that
s
about
all
but
i
say
he
exclaimed
you
re
really
good
with
that
light
oh
sure
she
laughed
rosa
and
i
we
re
a
great
team
oddly
enough
at
that
moment
she
had
the
feeling
of
one
who
acts
a
part
in
a
drama
a
part
she
is
sure
to
act
again
it
was
strange
rosa
norma
said
when
at
last
they
were
back
at
indian
point
headed
for
harbor
bells
and
a
good
dinner
i
never
dreamed
you
could
fly
a
fly
a
plane
rosa
threw
back
her
plump
shoulders
and
laughed
my
father
is
a
flier
he
is
also
a
guide
in
summer
he
takes
hunting
and
fishing
parties
deep
into
the
wilds
of
canada
ah
that
is
the
life
to
come
dropping
from
the
skies
like
a
wild
duck
and
to
light
on
a
perfect
spot
of
blue
water
where
almost
no
one
has
ever
been
and
she
paused
to
look
into
her
companion
s
eyes
will
you
believe
me
i
have
done
that
too
since
i
was
seventeen
years
old
fly
she
exclaimed
i
know
you
thought
i
was
crazy
in
des
moines
and
yes
i
was
crazy
crazy
to
feel
the
stick
in
my
hands
to
hear
the
motor
and
feel
a
plane
move
yes
i
was
crazy
but
those
boys
who
made
fun
of
me
those
young
could
have
flown
circles
around
every
one
of
them
but
you
you
were
very
kind
to
get
me
out
of
it
so
very
well
i
have
you
to
thank
for
that
and
we
ll
fly
again
some
time
maybe
huh
what
do
you
think
rosa
said
norma
you
are
a
dear
and
if
we
do
fly
again
i
shall
not
be
after
dinner
norma
made
a
call
in
her
own
village
she
had
discovered
a
bearded
veteran
of
the
photographic
world
who
still
did
a
little
work
in
his
own
home
he
was
a
picturesque
character
who
only
two
years
before
had
moved
from
portland
to
indian
harbor
to
this
man
she
had
entrusted
the
pictures
she
had
taken
of
the
poor
fisherman
s
wife
how
did
they
come
out
she
asked
as
she
entered
his
small
crowded
room
excellently
my
he
held
up
some
fairly
large
prints
he
had
made
oh
you
ve
done
them
so
well
she
exclaimed
won
t
she
be
pleased
she
will
he
agreed
i
have
a
son
who
works
on
a
portland
paper
with
your
consent
i
should
like
to
send
him
some
prints
of
these
studies
they
should
show
up
well
in
the
so
little
norma
makes
the
roto
she
laughed
that
would
be
something
wouldn
t
carl
langer
open
his
eyes
what
s
that
pig
got
to
do
with
it
the
old
man
demanded
he
refused
to
take
her
picture
said
he
couldn
t
waste
his
my
dear
said
the
old
man
time
spent
in
bringing
happiness
to
those
who
have
very
little
of
this
world
s
goods
is
never
that
s
right
norma
agreed
but
have
you
seen
carl
langer
s
estate
it
is
truly
yes
i
have
seen
it
it
is
attractive
however
carl
langer
did
nothing
to
it
he
only
bought
bought
it
he
told
me
he
inherited
it
from
his
father
who
lived
in
neither
carl
langer
nor
his
father
lived
in
portland
i
was
there
for
fifty
years
i
know
he
purchased
his
estate
from
the
heirs
of
old
judge
clark
where
he
got
the
money
i
don
t
know
but
i
could
make
a
good
ah
norma
thought
as
she
walked
slowly
back
to
harbor
bells
so
someone
else
is
suspicious
i
wonder
why
carl
langer
lied
to
me
about
his
she
found
herself
hoping
that
lieutenant
warren
would
go
with
her
to
visit
that
estate
and
to
look
at
the
picture
the
masterpiece
very
soon
yet
she
found
herself
dreading
it
and
shuddering
a
little
chapter
xxiv
the
decoy
beacon
once
again
the
following
night
the
trio
norma
rosa
and
marie
were
on
duty
in
the
upper
room
of
the
sea
tower
rosa
at
the
switchboard
norma
before
her
charts
and
marie
at
attention
for
any
emergency
for
more
than
an
hour
save
for
the
clock
on
the
wall
that
ticked
loudly
there
was
silence
in
the
room
then
came
a
buzz
at
the
switchboard
that
s
beth
calling
from
the
granite
head
spotter
norma
knew
the
number
what
does
she
want
she
s
relaying
a
report
from
betty
at
black
knob
rosa
explained
they
have
discovered
a
light
against
the
sky
well
out
to
tell
her
to
ask
betty
if
it
s
an
airplane
light
norma
suggested
rosa
relayed
the
message
for
a
time
after
that
there
was
silence
and
then
came
a
second
buzz
rosa
pressed
the
headphone
to
her
ear
and
listened
intently
she
says
that
betty
does
not
think
it
is
a
plane
light
it
does
not
move
across
the
sky
and
doesn
t
grow
brighter
as
it
would
if
it
was
coming
in
it
just
sort
of
light
on
the
mast
of
some
ship
norma
suggested
beth
says
she
suggested
that
rosa
explained
betty
told
her
it
seemed
too
oh
sublime
sweet
evening
star
norma
sang
softly
how
i
wonder
what
you
then
came
a
third
buzz
she
says
bess
has
heard
a
large
plane
a
long
way
off
the
shore
heading
might
be
an
enemy
bomber
norma
said
and
sat
straight
up
marie
got
the
men
below
on
the
phone
before
they
could
report
the
wac
watcher
on
the
water
tower
roof
popped
her
head
through
a
hole
to
report
the
same
plane
ten
seconds
later
beth
relayed
one
more
message
for
black
knob
they
too
had
heard
the
powerful
motors
of
a
large
plane
it
was
some
distance
north
of
the
mysterious
light
and
apparently
flying
straight
toward
it
here
surely
was
a
then
the
report
from
the
men
below
came
up
no
large
plane
was
due
anywhere
in
this
region
except
some
new
transport
planes
being
flown
overland
but
what
would
one
of
these
planes
be
doing
fifteen
miles
out
to
sea
was
the
question
that
came
from
the
puzzled
representatives
of
the
army
in
the
meantime
out
on
the
black
knob
spotter
tower
betty
and
grandfather
norton
were
wracking
their
brains
for
answers
to
all
these
problems
that
big
plane
certainly
is
going
straight
for
that
strange
light
betty
insisted
there
s
no
denying
that
grandfather
norton
agreed
moving
his
listening
horn
first
this
way
then
that
to
get
its
exact
location
it
was
strange
standing
there
watching
that
light
and
at
the
same
time
hearing
but
not
seeing
the
big
plane
just
then
someone
stepped
out
on
the
platform
it
was
lena
having
a
day
off
she
had
strangely
enough
chosen
to
spend
it
on
the
island
a
fisherman
would
take
her
ashore
next
morning
lena
betty
exclaimed
i
thought
you
were
fast
asleep
i
lena
shuddered
from
the
chill
of
the
night
but
something
woke
me
i
came
out
it
doesn
t
take
much
to
waken
you
said
betty
the
motor
of
a
distant
what
s
up
why
are
you
so
excited
lena
studied
their
faces
see
that
light
over
there
against
the
sky
yes
i
see
what
is
it
why
lena
broke
off
suddenly
she
seemed
greatly
disturbed
a
plane
she
exclaimed
suddenly
yes
we
ve
been
hearing
it
for
some
time
said
grandfather
norton
what
s
it
doing
out
there
lena
asked
there
was
a
strange
quality
in
her
voice
as
if
she
herself
knew
the
answer
betty
told
herself
well
grandfather
norton
spoke
slowly
if
i
wasn
t
dead
sure
that
there
was
nothing
but
water
out
there
miles
and
miles
of
water
i
should
say
that
the
light
was
a
beacon
to
a
landing
field
and
that
the
plane
was
heading
toward
it
for
a
oh
but
that
s
impossible
betty
exclaimed
certainly
it
is
norton
agreed
like
a
caged
animal
lena
began
pacing
the
narrow
platform
once
betty
thought
she
heard
her
murmur
tensely
it
s
terrible
just
what
was
terrible
and
how
did
this
big
girl
know
it
was
terrible
in
the
meantime
the
big
plane
was
coming
closer
ever
closer
to
the
swaying
light
those
on
shore
beth
bess
norma
rosa
and
the
rest
could
hear
the
plane
but
could
find
no
answer
to
the
question
why
is
it
there
lena
continued
to
pace
the
platform
watching
her
betty
realized
that
within
the
big
girl
s
mind
a
terrific
battle
was
raging
what
battle
she
asked
herself
and
why
for
a
time
she
found
no
answer
then
suddenly
the
answer
came
or
was
it
the
answer
see
here
lena
exclaimed
suddenly
gripping
betty
s
arm
until
it
hurt
i
can
t
stand
it
that
plane
is
going
to
come
down
close
to
that
light
it
will
crash
the
pilot
will
be
drowned
all
on
the
unless
what
betty
s
throat
was
dry
unless
we
go
to
the
rescue
lena
pulled
at
her
arm
there
s
not
a
moment
to
but
we
have
no
betty
stared
first
at
lena
then
at
norton
it
was
a
tense
moment
of
indecision
there
s
a
motorboat
a
pretty
fast
one
i
can
run
it
you
know
that
lena
s
voice
was
tense
with
emotion
yes
i
know
norma
told
me
how
you
saved
then
come
on
come
on
now
lena
s
voice
broke
she
did
not
finish
betty
looked
at
grandfather
he
did
not
speak
merely
nodded
his
head
betty
gulped
all
right
i
ll
go
instantly
the
two
girls
were
down
from
the
tower
and
racing
like
mad
for
the
dock
once
at
the
dock
lena
unscrewed
the
gas
tank
cap
flashed
a
light
down
into
the
tank
then
after
a
few
twists
at
the
cap
said
with
astonishing
calmness
get
in
we
are
illustration
there
s
not
a
moment
to
lose
lena
strange
questions
and
wild
emotion
came
and
went
over
betty
s
active
mind
as
they
headed
straight
for
that
light
and
at
full
speed
has
this
girl
lost
her
mind
she
asked
herself
or
does
she
know
some
terrible
secret
will
the
plane
really
come
down
for
the
moment
she
found
no
answer
but
the
answer
must
come
soon
even
as
she
thought
this
lena
exclaimed
there
what
did
i
tell
you
the
plane
is
beginning
to
circle
it
will
come
down
it
is
flying
high
but
it
will
come
this
betty
knew
was
true
the
sounds
that
came
from
the
plane
told
the
whole
story
as
she
watched
frightened
yet
fascinated
she
tried
to
measure
the
time
it
would
take
for
the
plane
to
come
down
now
it
must
she
thought
be
a
quarter
of
the
way
down
now
a
half
and
now
of
the
way
her
heart
skipped
a
beat
what
plane
was
this
would
it
really
crash
was
it
friend
or
foe
should
she
hope
for
a
crash
or
an
upward
swing
just
in
time
her
brain
was
in
a
whirl
the
light
has
vanished
lena
exclaimed
suddenly
it
was
true
the
light
had
blinked
out
still
the
plane
came
down
rapidly
there
seemed
no
stopping
it
now
after
breathing
a
prayer
betty
began
to
count
one
two
three
had
reached
twelve
when
there
came
the
sound
of
a
muffled
crash
now
if
only
we
can
save
them
she
thought
with
a
tightening
of
her
throat
and
yet
after
all
who
were
they
while
lena
kept
the
boat
at
its
utmost
speed
betty
stood
in
the
prow
and
strained
her
eyes
for
some
sign
of
the
wreck
at
last
her
vigil
was
rewarded
there
s
a
tiny
light
but
perhaps
that
s
the
one
that
it
is
not
that
one
lena
headed
straight
for
it
the
light
grew
brighter
a
dark
bulk
loomed
ahead
betty
heard
a
voice
calling
a
woman
s
voice
that
she
thought
was
strange
they
came
closer
are
you
hurt
she
called
no
we
re
not
hurt
a
woman
s
voice
answered
but
please
hurry
came
in
a
different
voice
the
plane
may
we
ve
been
hurrying
quite
a
while
betty
called
how
did
you
know
we
d
crash
came
back
i
didn
t
just
came
said
betty
that
light
was
a
decoy
came
from
the
plane
you
thought
there
was
a
field
here
betty
suggested
we
were
off
our
course
and
our
gas
was
low
one
voice
explained
we
came
down
to
and
i
took
the
plane
too
far
the
other
explained
well
now
you
re
safe
enough
betty
said
a
minute
later
as
lena
eased
the
boat
in
close
to
the
plane
s
wing
where
the
two
women
sat
at
the
same
time
she
threw
her
light
upon
them
they
were
she
discovered
surprisingly
young
and
beyond
a
shadow
of
doubt
americans
at
that
moment
words
from
a
very
old
book
came
to
her
an
enemy
hath
done
but
what
about
our
plane
one
of
the
girls
on
the
plane
asked
we
are
of
the
ferry
command
it
s
worth
a
lot
of
and
it
s
hardly
damaged
at
all
said
the
other
it
s
equipped
with
sort
of
that
can
be
filled
with
gas
in
just
no
time
said
the
first
one
why
don
t
you
fill
them
betty
asked
we
ll
stand
we
will
they
both
sprang
up
we
ll
be
right
back
right
a
moment
later
there
came
a
hissing
sound
and
the
plane
began
to
lift
slowly
the
water
is
smooth
i
m
sure
we
can
save
the
plane
said
lena
listen
betty
said
there
s
a
boat
before
the
two
girls
returned
their
arms
loaded
with
personal
belongings
two
fishing
boats
pulled
alongside
one
was
quite
long
the
other
small
what
happened
joe
tratt
asked
they
crashed
betty
explained
no
mention
of
the
decoy
light
that
would
come
later
we
re
going
to
try
towing
it
in
said
lena
i
ll
help
you
said
joe
my
boat
draws
a
lot
of
water
bill
can
take
you
all
in
his
boat
is
so
it
was
agreed
betty
and
the
two
strange
girls
piled
into
bill
s
boat
betty
called
so
long
and
good
luck
then
they
were
away
lena
is
the
strangest
girl
i
ever
knew
betty
told
herself
as
she
settled
in
her
place
she
wanted
terribly
to
talk
but
if
she
did
she
might
say
the
wrong
thing
so
she
said
never
a
at
least
until
she
sat
across
a
table
from
grandfather
norton
in
his
secret
den
then
she
really
opened
up
they
talked
for
an
hour
the
old
man
s
voice
was
mellow
his
words
came
slowly
thoughtfully
from
a
mind
betty
was
not
a
child
and
still
at
times
she
sprang
to
her
feet
to
exclaim
lena
knew
it
was
going
to
happen
she
really
knew
perhaps
was
the
slow
reply
then
again
perhaps
not
some
people
are
gifted
with
intuition
particularly
yes
i
know
even
i
suggested
first
that
the
plane
might
try
to
make
a
landing
he
added
there
was
the
whole
night
a
plane
seeking
a
landing
place
and
a
light
that
seemed
a
beacon
and
at
the
most
we
must
admit
he
added
thoughtfully
that
this
big
friend
of
yours
lena
might
well
have
been
the
means
of
saving
lives
it
was
a
mere
chance
that
saved
the
for
a
time
after
that
there
was
silence
then
he
spoke
again
it
would
seem
that
after
all
we
are
discussing
a
minor
problem
the
real
problem
is
who
put
out
that
decoy
light
if
it
was
a
decoy
and
how
did
they
take
it
down
decoy
betty
exploded
of
course
it
was
a
decoy
to
lure
our
airplanes
into
the
perhaps
let
s
pass
that
up
for
the
moment
and
ask
ourselves
how
the
light
got
there
did
you
see
or
hear
any
surface
craft
leave
the
spot
betty
shook
her
head
not
a
sign
nor
an
airplane
then
only
a
sub
could
have
put
up
that
light
with
a
long
telescoped
steel
pole
like
a
giant
fishing
rod
guyed
by
wires
they
could
hang
out
a
very
high
it
might
have
been
an
electric
light
on
a
wire
betty
suggested
then
they
could
have
blinked
it
out
on
the
certainly
and
when
the
plane
came
close
that
s
what
they
did
has
it
not
occurred
to
you
that
they
might
have
been
afraid
of
the
plane
i
think
they
were
afraid
of
with
the
plane
thundering
overhead
they
could
not
have
heard
your
motor
i
fancy
they
thought
the
plane
was
out
to
bomb
them
more
than
likely
they
then
why
the
light
betty
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
that
is
a
big
sub
these
large
subs
carry
small
seaplanes
that
can
be
catapulted
from
their
deck
if
their
plane
was
out
landing
spies
on
our
shores
or
spying
out
the
land
itself
they
may
have
had
a
beacon
out
to
guide
it
that
betty
laughed
is
good
enough
for
a
night
cap
i
m
going
to
retire
goodnight
she
was
gone
when
at
dawn
lena
and
joe
tratt
arrived
at
the
harbor
the
big
girl
appeared
ready
to
drop
and
yet
as
soon
as
the
plane
was
safely
grounded
on
the
sandy
beach
she
hired
a
fisherman
to
take
her
ashore
once
there
she
drank
three
cups
of
black
coffee
and
then
still
teetering
on
her
toes
she
climbed
the
stairs
entered
her
room
threw
off
her
coat
and
shoes
and
crept
under
the
blankets
to
fall
fast
asleep
chapter
xxv
the
masterpiece
early
that
afternoon
norma
who
had
cut
her
sleeping
hours
short
joined
lieutenant
warren
in
one
of
those
cars
known
as
peeps
and
went
spinning
down
the
shore
road
their
first
stop
was
the
cottage
occupied
by
bess
and
beth
school
norma
had
learned
was
out
because
of
a
teacher
s
convention
so
the
twins
were
free
to
go
with
them
to
the
spotter
shed
there
they
were
able
with
beth
s
help
to
hold
a
long
conversation
with
betty
it
was
evident
at
once
from
the
nervous
movements
of
betty
s
hands
before
the
television
camera
that
the
affair
of
the
night
before
had
left
her
greatly
excited
they
discussed
the
situation
very
thoroughly
as
they
left
the
spotter
shed
lieutenant
warren
said
it
looks
very
much
as
if
we
were
heading
straight
into
a
crisis
of
one
sort
or
another
such
things
as
these
can
t
go
on
big
planes
don
t
always
safely
in
the
they
seldom
do
norma
added
that
black
pigeon
of
betty
s
was
taken
from
the
shore
by
some
traitor
to
our
cause
and
put
aboard
some
probably
the
sub
norma
suggested
yes
and
in
this
way
every
secret
of
our
defense
will
in
time
leak
and
any
number
of
spies
may
land
on
our
shores
which
leads
to
carl
langer
his
black
pigeons
his
rich
estate
his
masterpiece
and
just
perhaps
to
the
spanish
norma
found
herself
rather
breathless
at
the
end
of
this
speech
you
hope
for
too
much
was
the
lieutenant
s
quiet
comment
however
we
will
present
carl
langer
with
our
calling
the
photographer
was
not
at
his
studio
but
the
girl
who
kept
the
shop
in
his
absence
offered
to
call
him
at
the
big
house
tell
him
that
norma
kent
and
lieutenant
warren
would
like
to
see
his
masterpiece
said
norma
word
came
over
the
wire
at
once
that
the
great
little
man
would
be
delighted
to
see
them
now
said
norma
as
they
drove
through
the
gate
if
his
three
huge
dogs
don
t
eat
us
up
peep
and
all
we
ll
get
on
black
pigeons
looking
like
dwarfed
nuns
sat
in
rows
on
the
barn
roof
but
no
dogs
appeared
to
announce
their
coming
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
had
been
watching
at
the
keyhole
the
photographer
whose
hair
seemed
whiter
and
more
bristling
than
ever
threw
open
the
door
the
instant
they
rang
the
bell
come
in
come
in
he
welcomed
mr
langer
this
is
lieutenant
warren
said
norma
for
a
brief
space
of
time
he
studied
the
newcomer
s
face
intently
but
rita
warren
was
older
than
when
she
was
in
india
then
too
she
had
made
her
face
up
rather
well
for
the
occasion
and
was
wearing
tinted
glasses
add
to
this
fact
that
a
woman
s
uniform
is
in
itself
something
of
a
disguise
and
it
may
not
seem
strange
that
at
first
at
least
he
did
not
recognize
her
but
then
norma
chided
herself
more
than
likely
he
is
not
the
man
at
all
spies
who
are
shot
seldom
show
up
somewhere
else
if
lieutenant
warren
recognized
the
man
neither
norma
nor
carl
langer
could
have
detected
it
from
her
action
she
thanked
him
for
his
interest
and
repeated
her
desire
to
see
his
masterpiece
you
shall
see
it
at
once
he
assured
them
after
that
we
will
have
some
brought
straight
from
india
you
don
t
often
get
that
but
he
stepped
to
a
table
to
press
a
hidden
buzzer
that
sounded
in
a
distant
room
is
that
for
a
servant
or
a
couple
of
murderers
norma
asked
herself
with
a
shudder
to
lieutenant
warren
she
whispered
india
lieutenant
warren
lifted
her
was
all
now
if
you
will
come
this
way
said
their
strange
host
leading
the
way
as
they
passed
down
a
long
corridor
norma
stole
a
glance
or
two
into
other
rooms
in
one
whose
door
stood
ajar
she
saw
an
open
traveling
bag
half
packed
what
is
that
for
she
asked
herself
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
they
entered
a
room
where
but
one
light
shone
this
came
from
a
long
slender
tube
close
to
the
ceiling
this
light
fell
upon
a
large
canvas
striking
a
pose
carl
langer
said
well
what
do
you
think
for
a
full
sixty
seconds
he
received
no
answer
they
all
stood
there
looking
at
the
picture
one
of
those
simple
things
that
can
if
well
done
be
magnificent
it
showed
a
peasant
youth
and
a
maid
in
her
middle
teens
seated
among
the
stubble
of
a
partly
mown
field
beside
them
were
their
scythes
and
rake
and
a
rustic
lunch
basket
back
of
them
was
a
shock
of
wheat
and
behind
that
the
waving
grain
on
their
faces
were
smiles
and
over
their
faces
played
the
sunlight
it
s
lovely
was
norma
s
comment
it
may
be
a
millet
lieutenant
warren
said
slowly
surely
it
is
like
his
work
but
some
of
the
colors
are
a
little
strange
there
are
to
be
sure
carl
langer
laughed
hoarsely
the
picture
has
been
neglected
i
found
it
in
an
old
church
in
a
village
i
am
restoring
norma
saw
lieutenant
warren
start
and
stare
but
she
said
never
a
word
as
they
left
the
room
as
they
prepared
to
take
tea
in
the
sunny
a
small
brown
man
entered
with
a
tray
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
hanada
said
langer
with
a
forced
laugh
it
is
true
that
he
is
of
japanese
blood
but
his
home
is
in
india
he
has
never
seen
at
that
the
little
brown
man
showed
all
his
teeth
in
a
grin
i
brought
him
with
me
from
india
was
the
hasty
reply
so
you
have
lived
in
india
how
grand
norma
exclaimed
yes
i
practiced
my
art
there
for
several
years
only
four
years
ago
i
sold
out
and
came
to
norma
breathed
has
your
successor
been
successful
lieutenant
warren
asked
in
an
even
tone
oh
yes
indeed
in
fact
he
has
become
a
permanent
resident
was
the
odd
reply
i
shouldn
t
wonder
said
lieutenant
warren
norma
barely
suppressed
a
laugh
so
it
was
the
man
who
followed
carl
langer
in
india
who
had
been
shot
as
a
spy
all
during
the
tea
carl
langer
seemed
ill
at
ease
his
eyes
often
sought
the
room
in
which
an
open
traveling
bag
awaited
his
return
wonder
if
he
is
going
on
a
journey
norma
thought
the
answer
a
long
long
journey
we
ll
have
to
be
going
back
lieutenant
warren
said
at
last
our
watch
changes
very
soon
and
i
must
be
their
host
expressed
polite
but
uneasy
regrets
they
bade
him
a
polite
farewell
and
were
away
as
their
car
started
they
were
greeted
by
a
loud
roar
as
three
huge
dogs
came
leaping
at
their
peep
they
were
however
quite
safe
in
the
car
so
avoiding
running
over
one
of
the
beasts
they
glided
out
of
the
gate
and
were
away
well
norma
breathed
deeply
believe
it
or
not
said
lieutenant
warren
he
is
my
spy
of
india
i
shall
get
sperry
on
his
trail
first
thing
in
the
chapter
xxvi
a
the
spot
shortly
after
noon
of
that
same
day
rain
squalls
came
sweeping
in
upon
black
knob
it
whipped
the
waters
into
foam
and
hid
the
island
from
all
the
world
riding
the
crest
of
this
storm
three
small
craft
approached
the
island
from
the
east
one
boasting
a
small
and
ragged
sail
towed
a
second
the
third
was
being
rowed
by
six
rugged
seamen
who
swung
their
long
oars
as
men
sometimes
seem
to
do
in
their
sleep
it
was
betty
who
first
discovered
them
she
had
wandered
down
to
the
dock
when
she
saw
them
looming
out
of
the
fog
at
first
she
was
frightened
but
a
second
look
told
her
that
no
invading
force
would
be
so
poorly
equipped
so
she
raced
away
to
the
fishing
village
to
tell
the
news
at
once
two
fishing
boats
took
off
in
due
time
they
came
in
with
the
boats
in
tow
by
that
time
everyone
on
the
island
was
down
by
the
dock
there
were
men
women
and
children
in
that
boat
of
them
in
all
and
they
were
a
sorry
sight
ours
was
the
mary
sachs
one
seaman
explained
she
were
a
coastwise
steamer
bound
for
baltimore
we
had
these
ladies
an
children
with
us
as
it
were
a
sub
to
be
sure
another
took
up
the
story
they
torpedoed
us
without
yes
a
woman
broke
in
shrilly
and
they
had
an
airplane
with
them
the
plane
swooped
down
and
our
lifeboats
look
at
sally
she
held
up
a
child
whose
face
was
white
as
a
sheet
both
her
legs
are
we
had
a
doctor
with
us
thank
god
for
that
said
another
woman
he
fixed
her
up
good
as
he
betty
swallowed
hard
as
she
put
out
her
hands
for
the
child
then
with
sturdy
tread
she
led
the
battered
and
half
frozen
band
to
the
hotel
where
a
great
fire
of
driftwood
roared
up
the
chimney
all
that
afternoon
the
wacs
and
in
truth
every
other
person
on
the
island
worked
with
the
ship
s
doctor
making
their
friends
comfortable
cots
and
beds
were
improvised
every
available
blanket
or
quilt
was
pressed
into
service
great
kettles
of
beef
beans
and
soup
boiled
constantly
on
the
hotel
s
range
it
was
only
toward
night
that
betty
felt
free
to
creep
away
to
the
log
cabin
for
an
hour
of
rest
little
patsy
went
with
her
but
did
not
remain
long
soon
she
was
out
wandering
among
the
rocks
keeping
an
eye
out
for
bad
gremlins
just
before
dark
sperry
the
fbi
agent
made
a
surprise
visit
to
the
cabin
grandfather
norton
was
there
betty
was
wakened
by
sperry
s
knock
on
the
door
so
these
three
shut
themselves
in
the
norton
den
i
came
over
here
looking
for
a
spy
sperry
announced
a
spy
grandfather
norton
exclaimed
we
are
all
loyal
people
out
you
don
t
understand
said
sperry
he
was
last
seen
heading
this
way
in
a
small
motorboat
it
s
that
photographer
over
at
granite
head
he
explained
to
betty
you
may
know
yes
betty
was
startled
he
did
all
our
work
i
never
yes
there
were
some
queer
things
about
queer
the
secret
agent
exploded
i
d
say
so
he
s
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
on
foot
we
ve
been
looking
for
him
he
was
a
spy
in
india
got
out
just
in
time
to
save
his
neck
he
ll
do
the
same
thing
here
if
he
can
you
haven
t
seen
a
small
motorboat
no
motorboat
was
norton
s
reply
three
lifeboats
came
ashore
shortly
after
noon
they
were
in
a
sorry
plight
their
ship
had
been
torpedoed
by
a
ah
those
subs
sperry
clenched
his
fists
there
are
rumors
of
a
sub
being
seen
off
shore
here
this
very
afternoon
fisherman
coming
in
from
the
banks
claims
he
saw
it
all
our
small
boats
are
out
scouting
for
it
but
me
i
m
after
just
one
man
and
his
name
s
carl
langer
well
we
haven
t
got
him
said
the
inventor
but
if
we
see
him
we
ll
hold
him
for
you
never
doubt
i
ll
have
a
look
about
the
sperry
was
up
and
away
a
half
hour
later
just
as
betty
was
thinking
i
should
be
out
on
the
spotter
platform
right
now
patsy
came
crashing
through
the
door
her
face
was
white
her
eyes
bulging
the
sub
she
whispered
hoarsely
it
s
so
close
i
saw
it
and
there
was
a
small
boat
yes
and
an
airplane
there
were
men
many
big
men
i
think
they
have
come
to
carry
us
this
betty
thought
as
she
stood
up
with
shaking
knees
this
is
not
one
of
patsy
s
dreams
about
gremlins
it
s
the
real
thirty
seconds
later
she
was
racing
with
norton
and
patsy
for
the
hotel
they
re
invading
the
island
betty
exclaimed
as
they
burst
into
the
lounge
room
of
the
hotel
there
s
a
sub
a
boat
an
airplane
and
many
where
where
where
came
in
a
chorus
where
betty
turned
to
patsy
by
bald
head
was
the
prompt
answer
the
other
end
of
the
island
grandfather
norton
explained
in
a
steady
voice
instantly
there
was
a
rush
for
the
door
but
grandfather
norton
was
there
before
them
steady
boys
he
held
up
a
hand
you
re
not
going
to
a
picnic
i
don
t
know
why
those
men
are
there
but
i
do
know
they
are
armed
we
must
organize
our
that
s
right
sir
an
army
sergeant
agreed
he
gave
an
order
to
his
men
they
disappeared
next
instant
the
door
opened
silently
and
in
stepped
sperry
his
eyes
were
wide
his
tongue
fairly
hanging
out
i
ran
into
a
hornet
s
nest
he
whispered
i
got
away
just
in
time
what
he
had
to
say
left
no
room
for
doubt
a
fight
was
in
the
making
when
the
army
squad
returned
it
was
with
arms
loaded
there
were
rifles
pistols
and
stacks
of
ammunition
then
after
one
weapon
had
been
selected
for
each
black
knob
man
the
sergeant
said
take
your
instantly
from
every
corner
came
the
men
whose
boat
had
been
struck
we
ll
kill
the
rats
the
burly
seaman
snarled
his
right
arm
was
in
a
sling
but
with
his
left
he
gripped
an
automatic
somebody
find
me
a
cane
one
seaman
begged
his
leg
was
bandaged
and
splinted
i
m
the
best
darn
shot
in
the
crew
that
s
what
i
am
from
somewhere
a
crutch
was
produced
one
man
half
rose
from
his
cot
whirled
about
then
fell
on
the
floor
no
not
you
tom
the
doctor
s
voice
was
gentle
you
re
too
badly
broken
it
was
a
motley
and
dangerous
crew
that
at
last
marched
silently
out
into
the
night
in
the
meantime
things
were
happening
fast
at
harbor
bells
while
preparations
were
being
made
for
the
battle
patsy
had
slipped
back
to
the
cabin
there
she
wakened
millie
and
mary
who
were
to
take
the
midnight
watch
with
their
help
she
set
up
the
television
camera
and
began
telling
the
exciting
news
to
beth
and
bess
as
fast
as
the
words
were
told
off
by
patsy
s
talking
hands
bess
phoned
them
to
norma
at
the
sea
tower
norma
got
tom
on
the
phone
tom
oh
tom
she
stammered
with
excitement
the
sub
is
out
by
black
knob
and
the
plane
too
if
you
could
just
go
out
and
spot
it
the
big
guns
would
blow
the
sub
from
the
sea
we
ll
go
said
tom
you
and
i
oh
tom
you
ll
have
to
go
tom
s
voice
insisted
there
s
not
a
man
in
the
harbor
who
knows
the
tricks
they
re
all
out
in
boats
looking
for
that
all
right
tom
i
ll
meet
you
at
the
she
hung
up
marie
she
commanded
you
keep
the
switchboard
rosa
get
your
coat
and
come
with
one
minute
more
and
they
were
joined
by
lieutenant
warren
who
somehow
had
learned
the
news
then
all
three
raced
for
the
dock
norma
was
faster
than
the
others
she
arrived
in
sight
of
the
dock
just
in
time
to
see
a
ghostly
figure
emerge
from
the
shadows
leap
at
tom
who
was
just
coming
to
the
dock
and
deal
a
heavy
blow
with
some
blunt
instrument
square
on
his
head
without
a
sound
tom
dropped
like
an
empty
sack
norma
had
seen
that
figure
before
she
had
battled
with
it
and
won
not
the
least
afraid
without
warning
she
landed
upon
it
with
a
blow
that
sent
it
crashing
against
a
wall
it
crumpled
into
a
white
heap
and
lay
there
like
a
pile
of
snow
happened
lieutenant
warren
panted
as
she
came
racing
up
in
a
few
words
norma
told
her
it
s
terrible
she
groaned
tom
is
out
for
keeps
he
s
dead
we
can
t
go
we
go
rosa
insisted
stoutly
i
can
pilot
the
plane
as
well
as
tom
could
what
do
you
think
norma
turned
to
the
lieutenant
illustration
ghostly
figure
leaped
at
tom
and
dealt
a
heavy
i
ll
not
command
you
was
the
slow
and
steady
answer
but
if
you
two
wish
to
volunteer
for
the
task
i
shall
not
stop
you
i
ll
take
care
of
tom
she
added
there
are
fishermen
near
who
will
help
one
minute
more
and
the
two
girls
were
rowing
rapidly
toward
the
seagull
that
was
to
fly
them
into
new
perils
on
black
knob
the
battle
lines
were
forming
never
had
a
band
of
indians
in
the
days
long
since
gone
moved
more
swiftly
or
silently
than
the
island
s
defenders
and
they
were
bent
on
swift
vengeance
driven
on
by
an
irresistible
impulse
betty
followed
the
last
man
the
one
with
a
crutch
as
she
glided
through
the
night
one
question
was
uppermost
in
her
mind
why
were
those
men
with
sub
motorboat
and
plane
there
the
sub
had
come
from
the
sea
the
plane
from
the
sub
and
the
motorboat
from
the
land
one
thing
was
plain
they
had
chosen
this
island
as
a
place
of
meeting
but
why
and
had
they
dared
they
haven
t
scouted
the
island
recently
was
her
conclusion
they
thought
it
was
occupied
only
by
old
men
and
women
well
they
ll
soon
know
better
just
one
more
ridge
and
we
are
there
her
pulse
quickened
just
as
they
left
the
grove
of
pines
the
moon
came
out
a
shadowy
figure
rose
above
the
crest
of
the
ridge
there
was
something
vaguely
familiar
about
that
figure
one
second
it
was
there
the
next
it
was
gone
for
rifles
had
cracked
the
fight
was
on
there
came
shouts
from
beyond
they
raced
up
the
ridge
their
fire
was
returned
but
feebly
there
was
the
sound
of
scrambling
feet
a
motor
roared
then
another
it
was
all
over
in
a
minute
and
over
forever
for
three
huddled
figures
that
would
never
move
again
enemies
betty
thought
perhaps
they
helped
women
and
yet
in
a
way
she
was
sorry
she
flashed
her
light
on
the
nearest
figure
then
she
gasped
it
was
carl
langer
this
time
the
spy
had
really
been
shot
when
the
men
reached
the
shore
the
moon
was
under
a
cloud
again
the
sub
had
vanished
the
motorboat
heading
out
to
sea
and
the
airplane
thundering
somewhere
in
the
sky
or
was
it
the
seagull
they
heard
out
there
over
the
black
waters
one
thing
was
was
there
at
the
controls
sat
rosa
norma
was
casting
her
light
about
in
search
of
the
sub
we
ll
find
the
sub
if
we
can
she
had
phoned
to
the
major
over
at
the
fort
when
i
hold
the
light
on
one
spot
you
ll
know
we
ve
found
we
ll
be
waiting
and
watching
had
been
his
answer
ready
to
blow
them
into
kingdom
come
and
so
now
they
circled
slowly
back
and
forth
only
one
question
troubled
her
and
that
was
is
that
enemy
plane
still
in
the
air
if
that
plane
is
armed
and
they
attack
us
she
said
to
rosa
we
will
climb
too
fast
for
them
was
the
calm
reply
and
then
norma
s
light
fell
upon
something
a
white
spot
not
the
sub
she
was
disappointed
then
her
heart
leaped
off
to
the
right
was
a
long
dark
bulk
the
sub
she
said
aloud
and
that
s
the
motorboat
they
are
coming
with
all
the
skill
she
possessed
she
held
her
wide
spot
of
light
on
the
sub
slowly
surely
the
sub
and
the
motorboat
moved
closer
together
breathlessly
she
awaited
the
roar
from
the
shore
the
major
can
t
fail
us
she
clenched
her
teeth
he
must
not
they
were
losing
altitude
and
coming
closer
to
the
sub
suddenly
they
were
surrounded
by
balls
of
smoke
and
flame
she
screamed
to
rosa
the
sub
is
firing
at
us
the
plane
gave
a
sudden
lift
and
shuddered
we
are
but
still
they
glided
on
then
came
the
distant
roar
thank
god
norma
screamed
climb
rosa
climb
but
they
did
not
climb
they
could
not
the
seagull
had
been
hit
the
first
shot
from
the
fort
was
quickly
followed
by
another
both
shells
burst
almost
beneath
them
giving
them
a
lift
they
would
not
soon
forget
the
shells
norma
saw
must
have
found
their
mark
for
when
she
played
her
light
on
the
water
she
found
only
tiny
bits
of
something
the
sub
and
motorboat
had
vanished
quick
rosa
she
cried
head
for
the
we
will
go
to
shore
was
the
slow
reply
perhaps
we
shall
go
but
not
quick
the
seagull
she
is
hit
she
may
norma
came
to
realize
this
more
and
more
as
the
gallant
plane
sank
slowly
toward
the
sea
they
were
in
close
to
land
when
with
a
suddenness
that
was
startling
the
seaplane
s
motor
stopped
and
then
they
plunged
into
the
sea
norma
hit
the
water
hard
she
sank
she
rose
she
sank
again
and
then
as
she
rose
she
began
to
swim
i
m
not
hurt
she
told
herself
the
water
is
terribly
cold
but
i
can
keep
up
for
a
her
time
was
about
up
her
body
was
numb
with
cold
her
breath
was
coming
in
gasps
when
she
became
conscious
of
someone
near
her
then
a
voice
said
put
your
hand
on
my
shoulder
i
ll
take
you
rosa
she
panted
i
can
t
do
that
you
ll
drown
not
rosa
said
the
voice
i
am
lena
believe
me
i
am
fresh
and
strong
put
your
hand
on
my
lena
she
thought
why
is
she
here
she
is
always
where
danger
at
that
she
surrendered
herself
to
the
other
s
superb
strength
they
had
gone
so
for
some
time
when
a
skiff
pulled
in
close
to
them
one
man
held
a
lantern
another
put
out
two
hands
to
pull
her
in
it
was
the
major
from
the
fort
several
hours
later
she
awoke
from
a
long
sleep
to
find
lieutenant
warren
sitting
by
her
side
everything
is
all
right
the
lieutenant
smiled
more
than
all
right
you
got
the
sub
and
the
motorboat
everyone
on
it
the
sub
was
bringing
spies
to
america
in
their
haste
they
left
their
traveling
bags
on
the
island
they
were
packed
with
american
clothes
faked
passports
everything
then
they
had
plans
maps
all
they
needed
for
destroying
factories
and
shipyards
i
think
she
added
that
they
meant
to
take
carl
langer
back
with
them
on
the
but
they
didn
t
norma
whispered
lena
has
confessed
lieutenant
warren
added
lena
norma
s
heart
sank
she
was
part
of
the
spy
ring
a
very
small
part
and
against
her
will
her
uncle
drove
her
to
it
by
terrible
threats
she
is
a
loyal
american
at
heart
she
has
turned
state
s
witness
that
will
trap
the
real
culprits
and
she
i
think
will
go
i
m
glad
norma
murmured
and
rosa
she
asked
after
a
moment
s
reflection
oh
rosa
she
s
a
dear
loyal
all
the
way
i
know
but
she
was
in
the
plane
with
me
of
course
she
wasn
t
thrown
from
the
plane
we
found
her
paddling
about
on
a
rubber
raft
still
searching
for
good
old
rosa
norma
murmured
so
i
was
partly
right
and
partly
wrong
about
all
this
spy
business
yes
it
is
often
like
how
s
tom
norma
sat
up
suddenly
tom
s
all
right
was
the
reply
he
came
round
almost
at
once
and
was
he
mad
when
he
knew
you
were
gone
then
he
wasn
t
really
injured
she
couldn
t
hit
him
very
she
yes
the
spanish
hairdresser
you
guessed
right
there
again
she
turned
out
to
be
a
professional
spy
the
lowest
creature
on
earth
sperry
knew
her
the
moment
his
eyes
fell
on
her
she
s
through
spying
for
good
and
someone
took
my
camera
twice
said
norma
perhaps
she
did
no
i
m
sorry
to
tell
you
but
that
was
lena
the
pictures
she
took
however
were
of
no
and
the
enemy
plane
from
the
sub
norma
suggested
as
she
settled
back
on
her
pillow
it
was
shot
from
the
air
by
one
of
our
fighter
looks
as
if
we
have
been
in
on
something
really
big
and
carried
it
off
norma
murmured
sleepily
there
will
be
promotions
all
round
was
the
happy
reply
very
soon
you
will
be
wearing
bars
on
your
oh
and
major
fairchild
is
to
pin
them
on
norma
exclaimed
that
will
be
one
big
day
they
re
sending
wacs
to
africa
now
rita
warren
said
after
a
time
shall
we
be
sent
there
i
don
t
know
would
you
like
to
go
i
m
too
tired
to
think
about
at
that
norma
turned
over
and
was
