commentary
on
the
epistle
to
the
galatians
by
martin
luther
translated
by
theodore
graebner
preface
the
preparation
of
this
edition
of
luther
commentary
on
galatians
was
first
suggested
to
me
by
zondervan
of
the
firm
of
publishers
in
march
the
consultation
had
the
twofold
merit
of
definiteness
and
brevity
luther
is
still
the
greatest
name
in
protestantism
we
want
you
to
help
us
publish
some
leading
work
of
luther
for
the
general
american
market
will
you
do
it
i
will
on
one
condition
and
what
is
that
the
condition
is
that
i
will
be
permitted
to
make
luther
talk
american
him
so
to
speak
because
you
will
never
get
people
whether
in
or
outside
the
lutheran
church
actually
to
read
luther
unless
we
make
him
talk
as
he
would
talk
today
to
americans
i
illustrated
the
point
by
reading
to
zondervan
a
few
sentences
from
an
english
translation
lately
reprinted
by
an
american
publisher
of
one
of
luther
outstanding
reformatory
essays
the
demonstration
seemed
to
prove
convincing
for
it
was
agreed
that
one
may
as
well
offer
luther
in
the
original
german
or
latin
as
expect
the
american
to
read
any
translations
that
would
adhere
to
luther
german
or
latin
constructions
and
employ
the
type
of
english
characteristic
of
the
translations
now
on
the
market
and
what
book
would
be
your
choice
there
is
one
book
that
luther
himself
likes
better
than
any
other
let
us
begin
with
that
his
commentary
on
galatians
the
undertaking
which
seemed
so
attractive
when
viewed
as
a
literary
task
proved
a
most
difficult
one
and
at
times
became
oppressive
the
letter
to
the
galatians
consists
of
six
short
chapters
commentary
fills
seven
hundred
and
octavo
pages
in
the
weidman
edition
of
his
works
it
was
written
in
latin
we
were
resolved
not
to
present
this
entire
mass
of
exegesis
it
would
have
run
to
more
than
fifteen
hundred
pages
ordinary
octavo
like
this
since
it
is
impossible
to
use
the
compressed
structure
of
sentences
which
is
characteristic
of
latin
and
particularly
of
luther
latin
the
work
had
to
be
condensed
german
and
english
translations
are
available
but
the
most
acceptable
english
version
besides
laboring
under
the
handicaps
of
an
archaic
style
had
to
be
condensed
into
half
its
volume
in
order
to
accomplish
the
streamlining
of
the
book
whatever
merit
the
translation
now
presented
to
the
reader
may
possess
should
be
written
to
the
credit
of
rev
gerhardt
mahler
of
geneva
who
came
to
my
assistance
in
a
very
busy
season
by
making
a
rough
draft
of
the
translation
and
later
preparing
a
revision
of
it
which
forms
the
basis
of
the
final
draft
submitted
to
the
printer
a
word
should
now
be
said
about
the
origin
of
luther
commentary
on
galatians
the
reformer
had
lectured
on
this
epistle
of
paul
in
and
again
in
it
was
his
favorite
among
all
the
biblical
books
in
his
table
talks
the
saying
is
recorded
the
epistle
to
the
galatians
is
my
epistle
to
it
i
am
as
it
were
in
wedlock
it
is
my
katherine
much
later
when
a
friend
of
his
was
preparing
an
edition
of
all
his
latin
works
he
remarked
to
his
home
circle
if
i
had
my
way
about
it
they
would
republish
only
those
of
my
books
which
have
doctrine
my
galatians
for
instance
the
lectures
which
are
preserved
in
the
works
herewith
submitted
to
the
american
public
were
delivered
in
they
were
taken
down
by
george
roerer
who
held
something
of
a
deanship
at
wittenberg
university
and
who
was
one
of
luther
aids
in
the
translation
of
the
bible
roerer
took
down
luther
lectures
and
this
manuscript
has
been
preserved
to
the
present
day
in
a
copy
which
contains
also
additions
by
veit
dietrich
and
by
cruciger
friends
of
roerer
who
with
him
attended
luther
lectures
in
other
words
these
three
men
took
down
the
lectures
which
luther
addressed
to
his
students
in
the
course
of
galatians
and
roerer
prepared
the
manuscript
for
the
printer
a
german
translation
by
justus
menius
appeared
in
the
wittenberg
edition
of
luther
writings
published
in
the
importance
of
this
commentary
on
galatians
for
the
history
of
protestantism
is
very
great
it
presents
like
no
other
of
writings
the
central
thought
of
christianity
the
justification
of
the
sinner
for
the
sake
of
christ
merits
alone
we
have
permitted
in
the
final
revision
of
the
manuscript
many
a
passage
to
stand
which
seemed
weak
and
ineffectual
when
compared
with
the
trumpet
tones
of
the
latin
original
but
the
essence
of
luther
lectures
is
there
may
the
reader
accept
with
indulgence
where
in
this
translation
we
have
gone
too
far
in
modernizing
luther
expression
making
him
talk
american
at
the
end
of
his
lectures
in
luther
uttered
a
brief
prayer
and
then
dictated
two
scriptural
texts
which
we
shall
inscribe
at
the
end
of
these
introductory
remarks
the
lord
who
has
given
us
power
to
teach
and
to
hear
let
him
also
give
us
the
power
to
serve
and
to
do
luke
glory
to
god
in
the
highest
and
on
earth
peace
good
will
to
men
isaiah
the
word
of
our
god
shall
stand
forever
theodore

from
luther
introduction
in
my
heart
reigns
this
one
article
faith
in
my
dear
lord
christ
the
beginning
middle
and
end
of
whatever
spiritual
and
divine
thoughts
i
may
have
whether
by
day
or
by
night
chapter
verse
paul
an
apostle
not
of
men
neither
by
man
but
by
jesus
christ
and
god
the
father
who
raised
him
from
the
dead
paul
wrote
this
epistle
because
after
his
departure
from
the
galatian
churches
fanatics
moved
in
who
perverted
paul
gospel
of
man
free
justification
by
faith
in
christ
jesus
the
world
bears
the
gospel
a
grudge
because
the
gospel
condemns
the
religious
wisdom
of
the
world
jealous
for
its
own
religious
views
the
world
in
turn
charges
the
gospel
with
being
a
subversive
and
licentious
doctrine
offensive
to
god
and
man
a
doctrine
to
be
persecuted
as
the
worst
plague
on
earth
as
a
result
we
have
this
paradoxical
situation
the
gospel
supplies
the
world
with
the
salvation
of
jesus
christ
peace
of
conscience
and
every
blessing
just
for
that
the
world
abhors
the
gospel
these
fanatics
who
pushed
themselves
into
the
galatian
churches
after
paul
departure
boasted
that
they
were
the
descendants
of
abraham
true
ministers
of
christ
having
been
trained
by
the
apostles
themselves
that
they
were
able
to
perform
miracles
in
every
way
they
sought
to
undermine
the
authority
of
paul
they
said
to
the
galatians
you
have
no
right
to
think
highly
of
paul
he
was
the
last
to
turn
to
christ
but
we
have
seen
christ
we
heard
him
preach
paul
came
later
and
is
beneath
us
it
is
possible
for
us
to
be
in
error
we
who
have
received
the
holy
ghost
paul
stands
alone
he
has
not
seen
christ
nor
has
he
had
much
contact
with
the
other
apostles
indeed
he
persecuted
the
church
of
christ
for
a
long
time
when
men
claiming
such
credentials
come
along
they
deceive
not
only
the
naive
but
also
those
who
seemingly
are
in
the
faith
this
same
argument
is
used
by
the
papacy
do
you
suppose
that
god
for
the
sake
of
a
few
lutheran
heretics
would
disown
his
entire
church
or
do
you
suppose
that
god
would
have
left
his
church
floundering
in
error
all
these
centuries
the
galatians
were
taken
in
by
such
arguments
with
the
result
that
paul
authority
and
doctrine
were
drawn
in
question
against
these
boasting
false
apostles
paul
boldly
defends
his
apostolic
authority
and
ministry
humble
man
that
he
was
he
will
not
now
take
a
back
seat
he
reminds
them
of
the
time
when
he
opposed
peter
to
his
face
and
reproved
the
chief
of
the
apostles
paul
devotes
the
first
two
chapters
to
a
defense
of
his
office
and
his
gospel
affirming
that
he
received
it
not
from
men
but
from
the
lord
jesus
christ
by
special
revelation
and
that
if
he
or
an
angel
from
heaven
preach
any
other
gospel
than
the
one
he
had
preached
he
shall
be
accursed
the
certainty
of
our
calling
every
minister
should
make
much
of
his
calling
and
impress
upon
others
the
fact
that
he
has
been
delegated
by
god
to
preach
the
gospel
as
the
ambassador
of
a
government
is
honored
for
his
office
and
not
for
his
private
person
so
the
minister
of
christ
should
exalt
his
office
in
order
to
gain
authority
among
men
this
is
not
vain
glory
but
needful
glorying
paul
takes
pride
in
his
ministry
not
to
his
own
praise
but
to
the
praise
of
god
writing
to
the
romans
he
declares
inasmuch
as
i
am
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
i
magnify
mine
office
i
want
to
be
received
not
as
paul
of
tarsus
but
as
paul
the
apostle
and
ambassador
of
jesus
christ
in
order
that
people
might
be
more
eager
to
hear
paul
exalts
his
ministry
out
of
the
desire
to
make
known
the
name
the
grace
and
the
mercy
of
god
verse
paul
an
apostle
not
of
men
etc
paul
loses
no
time
in
defending
himself
against
the
charge
that
he
had
thrust
himself
into
the
ministry
he
says
to
the
galatians
my
call
may
seem
inferior
to
you
but
those
who
have
come
to
you
are
either
called
of
men
or
by
man
my
call
is
the
highest
possible
for
it
is
by
jesus
christ
and
god
the
father
when
paul
speaks
of
those
called
by
men
i
take
it
he
means
those
whom
neither
god
nor
man
sent
but
who
go
wherever
they
like
and
speak
for
themselves
when
paul
speaks
of
those
called
by
man
i
take
it
he
means
those
who
have
a
divine
call
extended
to
them
through
other
persons
god
calls
in
two
ways
either
he
calls
ministers
through
the
agency
of
men
or
he
calls
them
directly
as
he
called
the
prophets
and
apostles
paul
declares
that
the
false
apostles
were
called
or
sent
neither
by
men
nor
by
man
the
most
they
could
claim
is
that
they
were
sent
by
others
but
as
for
me
i
was
called
neither
of
men
nor
by
man
but
directly
by
jesus
christ
my
call
is
in
every
respect
like
the
call
of
the
apostles
in
fact
i
am
an
apostle
elsewhere
paul
draws
a
sharp
distinction
between
an
apostleship
and
lesser
functions
as
in
i
corinthians
and
god
hath
set
some
in
the
church
first
apostles
secondarily
prophets
thirdly
teachers
he
mentions
the
apostles
first
because
they
were
appointed
directly
by
god
matthias
was
called
in
this
manner
the
apostles
chose
two
candidates
and
then
cast
lots
praying
that
god
would
indicate
which
one
he
would
have
to
be
an
apostle
he
had
to
have
his
appointment
from
god
in
the
same
manner
paul
was
called
as
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
the
call
is
not
to
be
taken
lightly
for
a
person
to
possess
knowledge
is
not
enough
he
must
be
sure
that
he
is
properly
called
those
who
operate
without
a
proper
call
seek
no
good
purpose
god
does
not
bless
their
labors
they
may
be
good
preachers
but
they
do
not
edify
many
of
the
fanatics
of
our
day
pronounce
words
of
faith
but
they
bear
no
good
fruit
because
their
purpose
is
to
turn
men
to
their
perverse
opinions
on
the
other
hand
those
who
have
a
divine
call
must
suffer
a
good
deal
of
opposition
in
order
that
they
may
become
fortified
against
the
running
attacks
of
the
devil
and
the
world
this
is
our
comfort
in
the
ministry
that
ours
is
a
divine
office
to
which
we
have
been
divinely
called
reversely
what
an
awful
thing
it
must
be
for
the
conscience
if
one
is
not
properly
called
it
spoils
one
best
work
when
i
was
a
young
man
i
thought
paul
was
making
too
much
of
his
call
i
did
not
understand
his
purpose
i
did
not
then
realize
the
importance
of
the
ministry
i
knew
nothing
of
the
doctrine
of
faith
because
we
were
taught
sophistry
instead
of
certainty
and
nobody
understood
spiritual
boasting
we
exalt
our
calling
not
to
gain
glory
among
men
or
money
or
satisfaction
or
favor
but
because
people
need
to
be
assured
that
the
words
we
speak
are
the
words
of
god
this
is
no
sinful
pride
it
is
holy
pride
verse
and
god
the
father
who
raised
him
from
the
dead
paul
is
so
eager
to
come
to
the
subject
matter
of
his
epistle
the
righteousness
of
faith
in
opposition
to
the
righteousness
of
works
that
already
in
the
title
he
must
speak
his
mind
he
did
not
think
it
quite
enough
to
say
that
he
was
an
apostle
by
jesus
christ
he
adds
and
god
the
father
who
raised
him
from
the
dead
the
clause
seems
superfluous
on
first
sight
yet
paul
had
a
good
reason
for
adding
it
he
had
to
deal
with
satan
and
his
agents
who
endeavored
to
deprive
him
of
the
righteousness
of
christ
who
was
raised
by
god
the
father
from
the
dead
these
perverters
of
the
righteousness
of
christ
resist
the
father
and
the
son
and
the
works
of
them
both
in
this
whole
epistle
paul
treats
of
the
resurrection
of
christ
by
his
resurrection
christ
won
the
victory
over
law
sin
flesh
world
devil
death
hell
and
every
evil
and
this
his
victory
he
donated
unto
us
these
many
tyrants
and
enemies
of
ours
may
accuse
and
frighten
us
but
they
dare
not
condemn
us
for
christ
whom
god
the
father
has
raised
from
the
dead
is
our
righteousness
and
our
victory
do
you
notice
how
well
suited
to
his
purpose
paul
writes
he
does
not
say
by
god
who
made
heaven
and
earth
who
is
lord
of
the
angels
but
paul
has
in
mind
the
righteousness
of
christ
and
speaks
to
the
point
saying
i
am
an
apostle
not
of
men
neither
by
man
but
by
jesus
christ
and
god
the
father
who
raised
him
from
the
dead
verse
and
all
the
brethren
which
are
with
me
this
should
go
far
in
shutting
the
mouths
of
the
false
apostles
intention
is
to
exalt
his
own
ministry
while
discrediting
theirs
he
adds
for
good
measure
the
argument
that
he
does
not
stand
alone
but
that
all
the
brethren
with
him
attest
to
the
fact
that
his
doctrine
is
divinely
true
although
the
brethren
with
me
are
not
apostles
like
myself
yet
they
are
all
of
one
mind
with
me
think
write
and
teach
as
i
do
verse
unto
the
churches
of
galatia
paul
had
preached
the
gospel
throughout
galatia
founding
many
churches
which
after
his
departure
were
invaded
by
the
false
apostles
the
anabaptists
in
our
time
imitate
the
false
apostles
they
do
not
go
where
the
enemies
of
the
gospel
predominate
they
go
where
the
christians
are
why
do
they
not
invade
the
catholic
provinces
and
preach
their
doctrine
to
godless
princes
bishops
and
doctors
as
we
have
done
by
the
help
of
god
these
soft
martyrs
take
no
chances
they
go
where
the
gospel
has
a
hold
so
that
they
may
not
endanger
their
lives
the
false
apostles
would
not
go
to
jerusalem
of
caiaphas
or
to
the
rome
of
the
emperor
or
to
any
other
place
where
no
man
had
preached
before
as
paul
and
the
other
apostles
did
but
they
came
to
the
churches
of
galatia
knowing
that
where
men
profess
the
name
of
christ
they
may
feel
secure
it
is
the
lot
of
god
ministers
not
only
to
suffer
opposition
at
the
hand
of
a
wicked
world
but
also
to
see
the
patient
indoctrination
of
many
years
quickly
undone
by
such
religious
fanatics
this
hurts
more
than
the
persecution
of
tyrants
we
are
treated
shabbily
on
the
outside
by
tyrants
on
the
inside
by
those
whom
we
have
restored
to
the
liberty
of
the
gospel
and
also
by
false
brethren
but
this
is
our
comfort
and
our
glory
that
being
called
of
god
we
have
the
promise
of
everlasting
life
we
look
for
that
reward
which
eye
hath
not
seen
nor
ear
heard
neither
hath
entered
into
the
heart
of
man
jerome
raises
the
question
why
paul
called
them
churches
that
were
no
churches
inasmuch
as
the
galatians
had
forsaken
the
grace
of
christ
for
the
law
of
moses
the
proper
answer
is
although
the
galatians
had
fallen
away
from
the
doctrine
of
paul
baptism
the
gospel
and
the
name
of
christ
continued
among
them
not
all
the
galatians
had
become
perverted
there
were
some
who
clung
to
the
right
view
of
the
word
and
the
sacraments
these
means
can
not
be
contaminated
they
remain
divine
regardless
of
men
opinion
wherever
the
means
of
grace
are
found
there
is
the
holy
church
even
though
antichrist
reigns
there
so
much
for
the
title
of
the
epistle
now
follows
the
greeting
of
the
apostle
verse
grace
be
to
you
and
peace
from
god
the
father
and
from
our
lord
jesus
christ
the
terms
of
grace
and
peace
are
common
terms
with
paul
and
are
now
pretty
well
understood
but
since
we
are
explaining
this
epistle
you
will
not
mind
if
we
repeat
what
we
have
so
often
explained
elsewhere
the
article
of
justification
must
be
sounded
in
our
ears
incessantly
because
the
frailty
of
our
flesh
will
not
permit
us
to
take
hold
of
it
perfectly
and
to
believe
it
with
all
our
heart
the
greeting
of
the
apostle
is
refreshing
grace
remits
sin
and
peace
quiets
the
conscience
sin
and
conscience
torment
us
but
christ
has
overcome
these
fiends
now
and
forever
only
christians
possess
this
victorious
knowledge
given
from
above
these
two
terms
grace
and
peace
constitute
christianity
grace
involves
the
remission
of
sins
peace
and
a
happy
conscience
sin
is
not
canceled
by
lawful
living
for
no
person
is
able
to
live
up
to
the
law
the
law
reveals
guilt
fills
the
conscience
with
terror
and
drives
men
to
despair
much
less
is
sin
taken
away
by
endeavors
the
fact
is
the
more
a
person
seeks
credit
for
himself
by
his
own
efforts
the
deeper
he
goes
into
debt
nothing
can
take
away
sin
except
the
grace
of
god
in
actual
living
however
it
is
not
so
easy
to
persuade
oneself
that
by
grace
alone
in
opposition
to
every
other
means
we
obtain
the
forgiveness
of
our
sins
and
peace
with
god
the
world
brands
this
a
pernicious
doctrine
the
world
advances
free
will
the
rational
and
natural
approach
of
good
works
as
the
means
of
obtaining
the
forgiveness
of
sin
but
it
is
impossible
to
gain
peace
of
conscience
by
the
methods
and
means
of
the
world
experience
proves
this
various
holy
orders
have
been
launched
for
the
purpose
of
securing
peace
of
conscience
through
religious
exercises
but
they
proved
failures
because
such
devices
only
increase
doubt
and
despair
we
find
no
rest
for
our
weary
bones
unless
we
cling
to
the
word
of
grace
the
apostle
does
not
wish
the
galatians
grace
and
peace
from
the
emperor
or
from
kings
or
from
governors
but
from
god
the
father
he
wishes
them
heavenly
peace
the
kind
of
which
jesus
spoke
when
he
said
peace
i
leave
unto
you
my
peace
i
give
unto
you
worldly
peace
provides
quiet
enjoyment
of
life
and
possessions
but
in
affliction
particularly
in
the
hour
of
death
the
grace
and
peace
of
the
world
will
not
deliver
us
however
the
grace
and
peace
of
god
will
they
make
a
person
strong
and
courageous
to
bear
and
to
overcome
all
difficulties
even
death
itself
because
we
have
the
victory
of
christ
death
and
the
assurance
of
the
forgiveness
of
our
sins
men
should
not
speculate
about
the
nature
of
god
the
apostle
adds
to
the
salutation
the
words
and
from
our
lord
jesus
christ
was
it
not
enough
to
say
from
god
the
father
it
is
a
principle
of
the
bible
that
we
are
not
to
inquire
curiously
into
the
nature
of
god
there
shall
no
man
see
me
and
live
exodus
all
who
trust
in
their
own
merits
to
save
them
disregard
this
principle
and
lose
sight
of
the
mediator
jesus
christ
true
christian
theology
does
not
inquire
into
the
nature
of
god
but
into
god
purpose
and
will
in
christ
whom
god
incorporated
in
our
flesh
to
live
and
to
die
for
our
sins
there
is
nothing
more
dangerous
than
to
speculate
about
the
incomprehensible
power
wisdom
and
majesty
of
god
when
the
conscience
is
in
turmoil
over
sin
to
do
so
is
to
lose
god
altogether
because
god
becomes
intolerable
when
we
seek
to
measure
and
to
comprehend
his
infinite
majesty
we
are
to
seek
god
as
paul
tells
us
in
i
corinthians
we
preach
christ
crucified
unto
the
jews
a
stumbling
block
and
unto
the
greeks
foolishness
but
unto
them
which
are
called
both
jews
and
greeks
christ
the
power
of
god
and
the
wisdom
of
god
begin
with
christ
he
came
down
to
earth
lived
among
men
suffered
was
crucified
and
then
he
died
standing
clearly
before
us
so
that
our
hearts
and
eyes
may
fasten
upon
him
thus
we
shall
be
kept
from
climbing
into
heaven
in
a
curious
and
futile
search
after
the
nature
of
god
if
you
ask
how
god
may
be
found
who
justifies
sinners
know
that
there
is
no
other
god
besides
this
man
christ
jesus
embrace
him
and
forget
about
the
nature
of
god
but
these
fanatics
who
exclude
our
mediator
in
their
dealings
with
god
do
not
believe
me
did
not
christ
himself
say
i
am
the
way
and
the
truth
and
the
life
no
man
cometh
unto
the
father
but
by
me
without
christ
there
is
no
access
to
the
father
but
futile
rambling
no
truth
but
hypocrisy
no
life
but
eternal
death
when
you
argue
about
the
nature
of
god
apart
from
the
question
of
justification
you
may
be
as
profound
as
you
like
but
when
you
deal
with
conscience
and
with
righteousness
over
against
the
law
sin
death
and
the
devil
you
must
close
your
mind
to
all
inquiries
into
the
nature
of
god
and
concentrate
upon
jesus
christ
who
says
come
unto
me
all
ye
that
labor
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
doing
this
you
will
recognize
the
power
and
majesty
condescending
to
your
condition
according
to
paul
statement
to
the
colossians
in
christ
are
hid
all
the
treasures
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
and
in
him
dwelleth
all
the
fulness
of
the
godhead
bodily
paul
in
wishing
grace
and
peace
not
alone
from
god
the
father
but
also
from
jesus
christ
wants
to
warn
us
against
the
curious
incursions
into
the
nature
of
god
we
are
to
hear
christ
who
has
been
appointed
by
the
father
as
our
divine
teacher
christ
is
god
by
nature
at
the
same
time
paul
confirms
our
creed
that
christ
is
very
god
we
need
such
frequent
confirmation
of
our
faith
for
satan
will
not
fail
to
attack
it
he
hates
our
faith
he
knows
that
it
is
the
victory
which
overcometh
him
and
the
world
that
christ
is
very
god
is
apparent
in
that
paul
ascribes
to
him
divine
powers
equally
with
the
father
as
for
instance
the
power
to
dispense
grace
and
peace
this
jesus
could
not
do
unless
he
were
god
to
bestow
peace
and
grace
lies
in
the
province
of
god
who
alone
can
create
these
blessings
the
angels
can
not
the
apostles
could
only
distribute
these
blessings
by
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
in
attributing
to
christ
the
divine
power
of
creating
and
giving
grace
peace
everlasting
life
righteousness
and
forgiveness
of
sins
the
conclusion
is
inevitable
that
christ
is
truly
god
similarly
john
concludes
from
the
works
attributed
to
the
father
and
the
son
that
they
are
divinely
one
hence
the
gifts
which
we
receive
from
the
father
and
from
the
son
are
one
and
the
same
otherwise
paul
should
have
written
grace
from
god
the
father
and
peace
from
our
lord
jesus
christ
in
combining
them
he
ascribes
them
equally
to
the
father
and
the
son
i
stress
this
on
account
of
the
many
errors
emanating
from
the
sects
the
arians
were
sharp
fellows
admitting
that
christ
had
two
natures
and
that
he
is
called
very
god
of
very
god
they
were
yet
able
to
deny
his
divinity
the
arians
took
christ
for
a
noble
and
perfect
creature
superior
even
to
the
angels
because
by
him
god
created
heaven
and
earth
mohammed
also
speaks
highly
of
christ
but
all
their
praise
is
mere
palaver
to
deceive
men
paul
language
is
different
to
paraphrase
him
you
are
established
in
this
belief
that
christ
is
very
god
because
he
gives
grace
and
peace
gifts
which
only
god
can
create
and
bestow
verse
who
gave
himself
for
our
sins
paul
sticks
to
his
theme
he
never
loses
sight
of
the
purpose
of
his
epistle
he
does
not
say
who
received
our
works
but
who
gave
gave
what
not
gold
or
silver
or
paschal
lambs
or
an
angel
but
himself
what
for
not
for
a
crown
or
a
kingdom
or
our
goodness
but
for
our
sins
these
words
are
like
so
many
thunderclaps
of
protest
from
heaven
against
every
kind
and
type
of
underscore
these
words
for
they
are
full
of
comfort
for
sore
consciences
how
may
we
obtain
remission
of
our
sins
paul
answers
the
man
who
is
named
jesus
christ
and
the
son
of
god
gave
himself
for
our
sins
the
heavy
artillery
of
these
words
explodes
papacy
works
merits
superstitions
for
if
our
sins
could
be
removed
by
our
own
efforts
what
need
was
there
for
the
son
of
god
to
be
given
for
them
since
christ
was
given
for
our
sins
it
stands
to
reason
that
they
can
not
be
put
away
by
our
own
efforts
this
sentence
also
defines
our
sins
as
great
so
great
in
fact
that
the
whole
world
could
not
make
amends
for
a
single
sin
the
greatness
of
the
ransom
christ
the
son
of
god
indicates
this
the
vicious
character
of
sin
is
brought
out
by
the
words
who
gave
himself
for
our
sins
so
vicious
is
sin
that
only
the
sacrifice
of
christ
could
atone
for
sin
when
we
reflect
that
the
one
little
word
sin
embraces
the
whole
kingdom
of
satan
and
that
it
includes
everything
that
is
horrible
we
have
reason
to
tremble
but
we
are
careless
we
make
light
of
sin
we
think
that
by
some
little
work
or
merit
we
can
dismiss
sin
this
passage
then
bears
out
the
fact
that
all
men
are
sold
under
sin
sin
is
an
exacting
despot
who
can
be
vanquished
by
no
created
power
but
by
the
sovereign
power
of
jesus
christ
alone
all
this
is
of
wonderful
comfort
to
a
conscience
troubled
by
the
enormity
of
sin
sin
can
not
harm
those
who
believe
in
christ
because
he
has
overcome
sin
by
his
death
armed
with
this
conviction
we
are
enlightened
and
may
pass
judgment
upon
the
papists
monks
nuns
priests
mohammedans
anabaptists
and
all
who
trust
in
their
own
merits
as
wicked
and
destructive
sects
that
rob
god
and
christ
of
the
honor
that
belongs
to
them
alone
note
especially
the
pronoun
our
and
its
significance
you
will
readily
grant
that
christ
gave
himself
for
the
sins
of
peter
paul
and
others
who
were
worthy
of
such
grace
but
feeling
low
you
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
christ
gave
himself
for
your
sins
our
feelings
shy
at
a
personal
application
of
the
pronoun
our
and
we
refuse
to
have
anything
to
do
with
god
until
we
have
made
ourselves
worthy
by
good
deeds
this
attitude
springs
from
a
false
conception
of
sin
the
conception
that
sin
is
a
small
matter
easily
taken
care
of
by
good
works
that
we
must
present
ourselves
unto
god
with
a
good
conscience
that
we
must
feel
no
sin
before
we
may
feel
that
christ
was
given
for
our
sins
this
attitude
is
universal
and
particularly
developed
in
those
who
consider
themselves
better
than
others
such
readily
confess
that
they
are
frequent
sinners
but
they
regard
their
sins
as
of
no
such
importance
that
they
can
not
easily
be
dissolved
by
some
good
action
or
that
they
may
not
appear
before
the
tribunal
of
christ
and
demand
the
reward
of
eternal
life
for
their
righteousness
meantime
they
pretend
great
humility
and
acknowledge
a
certain
degree
of
sinfulness
for
which
they
soulfully
join
in
the
publican
prayer
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
but
the
real
significance
and
comfort
of
the
words
for
our
sins
is
lost
upon
them
the
genius
of
christianity
takes
the
words
of
paul
who
gave
himself
for
our
sins
as
true
and
efficacious
we
are
not
to
look
upon
our
sins
as
insignificant
trifles
on
the
other
hand
we
are
not
to
regard
them
as
so
terrible
that
we
must
despair
learn
to
believe
that
christ
was
given
not
for
picayune
and
imaginary
transgressions
but
for
mountainous
sins
not
for
one
or
two
but
for
all
not
for
sins
that
can
be
discarded
but
for
sins
that
are
stubbornly
ingrained
practice
this
knowledge
and
fortify
yourself
against
despair
particularly
in
the
last
hour
when
the
memory
of
past
sins
assails
the
conscience
say
with
confidence
christ
the
son
of
god
was
given
not
for
the
righteous
but
for
sinners
if
i
had
no
sin
i
should
not
need
christ
no
satan
you
can
not
delude
me
into
thinking
i
am
holy
the
truth
is
i
am
all
sin
my
sins
are
not
imaginary
transgressions
but
sins
against
the
first
table
unbelief
doubt
despair
contempt
hatred
ignorance
of
god
ingratitude
towards
him
misuse
of
his
name
neglect
of
his
word
etc
and
sins
against
the
second
table
dishonor
of
parents
disobedience
of
government
coveting
of
possessions
etc
granted
that
i
have
not
committed
murder
adultery
theft
and
similar
sins
in
deed
nevertheless
i
have
committed
them
in
the
heart
and
therefore
i
am
a
transgressor
of
all
the
commandments
of
god
because
my
transgressions
are
multiplied
and
my
own
efforts
at
rather
a
hindrance
than
a
furtherance
therefore
christ
the
son
of
god
gave
himself
into
death
for
my
sins
to
believe
this
is
to
have
eternal
life
let
us
equip
ourselves
against
the
accusations
of
satan
with
this
and
similar
passages
of
holy
scripture
if
he
says
thou
shalt
be
damned
you
tell
him
no
for
i
fly
to
christ
who
gave
himself
for
my
sins
in
accusing
me
of
being
a
damnable
sinner
you
are
cutting
your
own
throat
satan
you
are
reminding
me
of
god
fatherly
goodness
toward
me
that
he
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
son
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
everlasting
life
in
calling
me
a
sinner
satan
you
really
comfort
me
above
measure
with
such
heavenly
cunning
we
are
to
meet
the
devil
craft
and
put
from
us
the
memory
of
sin
paul
also
presents
a
true
picture
of
christ
as
the
son
of
god
delivered
into
death
for
our
sins
to
entertain
a
true
conception
of
christ
is
important
for
the
devil
describes
christ
as
an
exacting
and
cruel
judge
who
condemns
and
punishes
men
tell
him
that
his
definition
of
christ
is
wrong
that
christ
has
given
himself
for
our
sins
that
by
his
sacrifice
he
has
taken
away
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
make
ample
use
of
this
pronoun
our
be
assured
that
christ
has
canceled
the
sins
not
of
certain
persons
only
but
your
sins
do
not
permit
yourself
to
be
robbed
of
this
lovely
conception
of
christ
christ
is
no
moses
no
no
tyrant
but
the
mediator
for
sins
the
giver
of
grace
and
life
we
know
this
yet
in
the
actual
conflict
with
the
devil
when
he
scares
us
with
the
law
when
he
frightens
us
with
the
very
person
of
the
mediator
when
he
misquotes
the
words
of
christ
and
distorts
for
us
our
savior
we
so
easily
lose
sight
of
our
sweet
for
this
reason
i
am
so
anxious
for
you
to
gain
a
true
picture
of
christ
out
of
the
words
of
paul
who
gave
himself
for
our
sins
obviously
christ
is
no
judge
to
condemn
us
for
he
gave
himself
for
our
sins
he
does
not
trample
the
fallen
but
raises
them
he
comforts
the
otherwise
paul
should
lie
when
he
writes
who
gave
himself
for
our
sins
i
do
not
bother
my
head
with
speculations
about
the
nature
of
god
i
simply
attach
myself
to
the
human
christ
and
i
find
joy
and
peace
and
the
wisdom
of
god
in
him
these
are
not
new
truths
i
am
repeating
what
the
apostles
and
all
teachers
of
god
have
taught
long
ago
would
to
god
we
could
impregnate
our
hearts
with
these
truths
verse
that
he
might
deliver
us
from
this
present
evil
world
paul
calls
this
present
world
evil
because
everything
in
it
is
subject
to
the
malice
of
the
devil
who
reigns
over
the
whole
world
as
his
domain
and
fills
the
air
with
ignorance
contempt
hatred
and
disobedience
of
god
in
this
devil
kingdom
we
live
as
long
as
a
person
is
in
the
world
he
can
not
by
his
own
efforts
rid
himself
of
sin
because
the
world
is
bent
upon
evil
the
people
of
the
world
are
the
slaves
of
the
devil
if
we
are
not
in
the
kingdom
of
christ
it
is
certain
we
belong
to
the
kingdom
of
satan
and
we
are
pressed
into
his
service
with
every
talent
we
possess
take
the
talents
of
wisdom
and
integrity
without
christ
wisdom
is
double
foolishness
and
integrity
double
sin
because
they
not
only
fail
to
perceive
the
wisdom
and
righteousness
of
christ
but
hinder
and
blaspheme
the
salvation
of
christ
paul
justly
calls
it
the
evil
or
wicked
world
for
when
the
world
is
at
its
best
the
world
is
at
its
worst
the
grossest
vices
are
small
faults
in
comparison
with
the
wisdom
and
righteousness
of
the
world
these
prevent
men
from
accepting
the
gospel
of
the
righteousness
of
christ
the
white
devil
of
spiritual
sin
is
far
more
dangerous
than
the
black
devil
of
carnal
sin
because
the
wiser
the
better
men
are
without
christ
the
more
they
are
likely
to
ignore
and
oppose
the
gospel
with
the
words
that
he
might
deliver
us
paul
argues
that
we
stand
in
need
of
christ
no
other
being
can
possibly
deliver
us
from
this
present
evil
world
do
not
let
the
fact
disturb
you
that
a
great
many
people
enjoy
excellent
reputations
without
christ
remember
what
paul
says
that
the
world
with
all
its
wisdom
might
and
righteousness
is
the
devil
own
god
alone
is
able
to
deliver
us
from
the
world
let
us
praise
and
thank
god
for
his
mercy
in
delivering
us
from
the
captivity
of
satan
when
we
were
unable
to
do
so
by
our
own
strength
let
us
confess
with
paul
that
all
our
is
loss
and
dung
let
us
condemn
as
filthy
rags
all
talk
about
free
will
all
religious
orders
masses
ceremonies
vows
fastings
and
the
like
in
branding
the
world
the
devil
kingdom
of
iniquity
ignorance
error
sin
death
and
everlasting
despair
paul
at
the
same
time
declares
the
kingdom
of
christ
to
be
a
kingdom
of
equity
light
grace
remission
of
sin
peace
saving
health
and
everlasting
life
into
which
we
are
translated
by
our
lord
jesus
christ
to
whom
be
glory
forever
in
this
passage
paul
contends
against
the
false
apostles
for
the
article
of
justification
christ
says
paul
has
delivered
us
from
this
wicked
kingdom
of
the
devil
and
the
world
according
to
the
good
will
the
pleasure
and
commandment
of
the
father
hence
we
are
not
delivered
by
our
own
will
or
shrewdness
or
wisdom
but
by
the
mercy
and
love
of
god
as
it
is
written
i
john
herein
is
love
not
that
we
loved
god
but
that
he
loved
us
and
sent
his
son
to
be
the
propitiation
for
our
sins
another
reason
why
paul
like
john
emphasizes
the
father
will
is
christ
habit
of
directing
attention
to
the
father
for
christ
came
into
the
world
to
reconcile
god
with
us
and
to
draw
us
to
the
father
not
by
curious
inquiries
into
the
nature
of
god
shall
we
know
god
and
his
purpose
for
our
salvation
but
by
taking
hold
of
christ
who
according
to
the
will
of
the
father
has
given
himself
into
death
for
our
sins
when
we
understand
this
to
be
the
will
of
the
father
in
christ
then
shall
we
know
god
to
be
merciful
and
not
angry
we
shall
realize
that
he
loved
us
wretched
sinners
so
much
indeed
that
he
gave
us
his
son
into
death
for
us
the
pronoun
our
refers
to
both
god
and
father
he
is
our
god
and
our
father
christ
father
and
our
father
are
one
and
the
same
hence
christ
said
to
mary
magdalene
go
to
my
brethren
and
say
unto
them
i
ascend
unto
my
father
and
your
father
and
to
my
god
and
your
god
god
is
our
father
and
our
god
but
only
in
christ
jesus
verse
to
whom
be
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
hebrew
writing
is
interspersed
with
expressions
of
praise
and
gratitude
this
peculiarity
can
be
traced
in
the
apostolic
writings
particularly
in
those
of
paul
the
name
of
the
lord
is
to
be
mentioned
with
great
reverence
and
thanksgiving
verse
i
marvel
how
patiently
paul
deals
with
his
seduced
galatians
he
does
not
pounce
on
them
but
like
a
father
he
fairly
excuses
their
error
with
motherly
affection
he
talks
to
them
yet
he
does
it
in
a
way
that
at
the
same
time
he
also
reproves
them
on
the
other
hand
he
is
highly
indignant
at
the
seducers
whom
he
blames
for
the
apostasy
of
the
galatians
his
anger
bursts
forth
in
elemental
fury
at
the
beginning
of
his
epistle
if
any
may
he
cries
preach
any
other
gospel
unto
you
than
that
ye
have
received
let
him
be
accursed
later
on
in
the
fifth
chapter
he
threatens
the
false
apostles
with
damnation
he
that
troubleth
you
shall
bear
his
judgment
whosoever
he
be
he
pronounces
a
curse
upon
them
i
would
they
were
even
cut
off
which
trouble
you
he
might
have
addressed
the
galatians
after
this
fashion
i
am
ashamed
of
you
your
ingratitude
grieves
me
i
am
angry
with
you
but
his
purpose
was
to
call
them
back
to
the
gospel
with
this
purpose
in
his
mind
he
speaks
very
gently
to
them
he
could
not
have
chosen
a
milder
expression
than
this
i
marvel
it
indicates
his
sorrow
and
his
displeasure
paul
minds
the
rule
which
he
himself
lays
down
in
a
later
chapter
where
he
says
brethren
if
a
man
be
overtaken
in
a
fault
ye
which
are
spiritual
restore
such
an
one
in
the
spirit
of
meekness
considering
thyself
lest
thou
also
be
tempted
toward
those
who
have
been
misled
we
are
to
show
ourselves
parentally
affectionate
so
that
they
may
perceive
that
we
seek
not
their
destruction
but
their
salvation
over
against
the
devil
and
his
missionaries
the
authors
of
false
doctrines
and
sects
we
ought
to
be
like
the
apostle
impatient
and
rigorously
condemnatory
as
parents
are
with
the
dog
that
bites
their
little
one
but
the
weeping
child
itself
they
soothe
the
right
spirit
in
paul
supplies
him
with
an
extraordinary
facility
in
handling
the
afflicted
consciences
of
the
fallen
the
pope
and
his
bishops
inspired
by
the
desire
to
lord
it
over
men
souls
crack
out
thunders
and
curses
upon
miserable
consciences
they
have
no
care
for
the
saving
of
men
souls
they
are
interested
only
in
maintaining
their
position
verse
that
ye
are
so
soon
paul
deplores
the
fact
that
it
is
difficult
for
the
mind
to
retain
a
sound
and
steadfast
faith
a
man
labors
for
a
decade
before
he
succeeds
in
training
his
little
church
into
orderly
religion
and
then
some
ignorant
and
vicious
poltroon
comes
along
to
overthrow
in
a
minute
the
patient
labor
of
years
by
the
grace
of
god
we
have
effected
here
in
wittenberg
the
form
of
a
christian
church
the
word
of
god
is
taught
as
it
should
be
the
sacraments
are
administered
and
everything
is
prosperous
this
happy
condition
secured
by
many
years
of
arduous
labors
some
lunatic
might
spoil
in
a
moment
this
happened
in
the
churches
of
galatia
which
paul
had
brought
into
life
in
spiritual
travail
soon
after
his
departure
however
these
galatian
churches
were
thrown
into
confusion
by
the
false
apostles
the
church
is
a
tender
plant
it
must
be
watched
people
hear
a
couple
of
sermons
scan
a
few
pages
of
holy
writ
and
think
they
know
it
all
they
are
bold
because
they
have
never
gone
through
any
trials
of
faith
void
of
the
holy
spirit
they
teach
what
they
please
as
long
as
it
sounds
good
to
the
common
people
who
are
ever
ready
to
join
something
new
we
have
to
watch
out
for
the
devil
lest
he
sow
tares
among
the
wheat
while
we
sleep
no
sooner
had
paul
turned
his
back
on
the
churches
of
galatia
than
the
false
apostles
went
to
work
therefore
let
us
watch
over
ourselves
and
over
the
whole
church
verse
i
marvel
that
ye
are
so
soon
removed
again
the
apostle
puts
in
a
gentle
word
he
does
not
berate
the
galatians
i
marvel
that
ye
are
so
unsteady
unfaithful
he
says
i
marvel
that
ye
are
so
soon
removed
he
does
not
address
them
as
evildoers
he
speaks
to
them
as
people
who
have
suffered
great
loss
he
condemns
those
who
removed
them
rather
than
the
galatians
at
the
same
time
he
gently
reproves
them
for
permitting
themselves
to
be
removed
the
criticism
is
implied
that
they
should
have
been
rather
a
little
more
settled
in
their
beliefs
if
they
had
taken
better
hold
of
the
word
they
could
not
have
been
removed
so
easily
jerome
thinks
that
paul
is
playing
upon
the
name
galatians
deriving
it
from
the
hebrew
word
galath
which
means
fallen
or
carried
away
as
though
paul
wanted
to
say
you
are
true
galatians
fallen
away
in
name
and
in
fact
some
believe
that
the
germans
are
descended
from
the
galatians
there
may
be
something
to
that
for
the
germans
are
not
unlike
the
galatians
in
their
lack
of
constancy
at
first
we
germans
are
very
enthusiastic
but
presently
our
emotions
cool
and
we
become
slack
when
the
light
of
the
gospel
first
came
to
us
many
were
zealous
heard
sermons
greedily
and
held
the
ministry
of
god
word
in
high
esteem
but
now
that
religion
has
been
reformed
many
who
formerly
were
such
earnest
disciples
have
discarded
the
word
of
god
have
become
like
the
foolish
and
inconsistent
galatians
verse
from
him
that
called
you
into
the
grace
of
christ
the
reading
is
a
little
doubtful
the
sentence
may
be
construed
to
read
from
that
christ
that
called
you
into
grace
or
it
may
be
construed
to
read
from
god
that
called
you
into
the
grace
of
christ
i
prefer
the
former
for
it
seems
to
me
that
paul
purpose
is
to
impress
upon
us
the
benefits
of
christ
this
reading
also
preserves
the
implied
criticism
that
the
galatians
withdrew
themselves
from
that
christ
who
had
called
them
not
unto
the
law
but
unto
grace
with
paul
we
decry
the
blindness
and
perverseness
of
men
in
that
they
will
not
receive
the
message
of
grace
and
salvation
or
having
received
it
they
quickly
let
go
of
it
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
gospel
bestows
all
good
things
spiritual
forgiveness
of
sins
true
righteousness
peace
of
conscience
everlasting
life
and
all
good
things
temporal
good
judgment
good
government
and
peace
why
does
the
world
abhor
the
glad
tidings
of
the
gospel
and
the
blessings
that
go
with
it
because
the
world
is
the
devil
under
his
direction
the
world
persecutes
the
gospel
and
would
if
it
could
nail
again
christ
the
son
of
god
to
the
cross
although
he
gave
himself
into
death
for
the
sins
of
the
world
the
world
dwells
in
darkness
the
world
is
darkness
paul
accentuates
the
point
that
the
galatians
had
been
called
by
christ
unto
grace
i
taught
you
the
doctrine
of
grace
and
of
liberty
from
the
law
from
sin
and
wrath
that
you
should
be
free
in
christ
and
not
slaves
to
the
hard
laws
of
moses
will
you
allow
yourselves
to
be
carried
away
so
easily
from
the
living
fountain
of
grace
and
life
verse
unto
another
gospel
note
the
resourcefulness
of
the
devil
heretics
do
not
advertise
their
errors
murderers
adulterers
thieves
disguise
themselves
so
the
devil
masquerades
all
his
devices
and
activities
he
puts
on
white
to
make
himself
look
like
an
angel
of
light
he
is
astoundingly
clever
to
sell
his
patent
poison
for
the
gospel
of
christ
knowing
satan
guile
paul
sardonically
calls
the
doctrine
of
the
false
apostles
another
gospel
as
if
he
would
say
you
galatians
have
now
another
gospel
while
my
gospel
is
no
longer
esteemed
by
you
we
infer
from
this
that
the
false
apostles
had
depreciated
the
gospel
of
paul
among
the
galatians
on
the
plea
that
it
was
incomplete
their
objection
to
paul
gospel
is
identical
to
that
recorded
in
the
fifteenth
chapter
of
the
book
of
acts
to
the
effect
that
it
was
not
enough
for
the
galatians
to
believe
in
christ
or
to
be
baptized
but
that
it
was
needful
to
circumcise
them
and
to
command
them
to
keep
the
law
of
moses
for
except
ye
be
circumcised
after
the
manner
of
moses
ye
can
not
be
saved
as
though
christ
were
a
workman
who
had
begun
a
building
and
left
it
for
moses
to
finish
today
the
anabaptists
and
others
finding
it
difficult
to
condemn
us
accuse
us
lutherans
of
timidity
in
professing
the
whole
truth
they
grant
that
we
have
laid
the
foundation
in
christ
but
claim
that
we
have
failed
to
go
through
with
the
building
in
this
way
these
perverse
fanatics
parade
their
cursed
doctrine
as
the
word
of
god
and
flying
the
flag
of
god
name
they
deceive
many
the
devil
knows
better
than
to
appear
ugly
and
black
he
prefers
to
carry
on
his
nefarious
activities
in
the
name
of
god
hence
the
german
proverb
all
mischief
begins
in
the
name
of
god
when
the
devil
sees
that
he
can
not
hurt
the
cause
of
the
gospel
by
destructive
methods
he
does
it
under
the
guise
of
correcting
and
advancing
the
cause
of
the
gospel
he
would
like
best
of
all
to
persecute
us
with
fire
and
sword
but
this
method
has
availed
him
little
because
through
the
blood
of
martyrs
the
church
has
been
watered
unable
to
prevail
by
force
he
engages
wicked
and
ungodly
teachers
who
at
first
make
common
cause
with
us
then
claim
that
they
are
particularly
called
to
teach
the
hidden
mysteries
of
the
scriptures
to
superimpose
upon
the
first
principles
of
christian
doctrine
that
we
teach
this
sort
of
thing
brings
the
gospel
into
trouble
may
we
all
cling
to
the
word
of
christ
against
the
wiles
of
the
devil
for
we
wrestle
not
against
flesh
and
blood
but
against
principalities
against
powers
against
the
rulers
of
the
darkness
of
this
world
against
spiritual
wickedness
in
high
places
verse
which
is
not
another
but
there
be
some
that
trouble
you
here
again
the
apostle
excuses
the
galatians
while
he
blames
the
false
apostles
for
disturbing
their
consciences
and
for
stealing
them
out
of
his
hand
how
angry
he
gets
at
these
deceivers
he
calls
them
troublemakers
seducers
of
poor
consciences
this
passage
adduces
further
evidence
that
the
false
apostles
defamed
paul
as
an
imperfect
apostle
and
a
weak
and
erroneous
preacher
they
condemn
paul
paul
condemns
them
such
warfare
of
condemnation
is
always
going
on
in
the
church
the
papists
and
the
fanatics
hate
us
condemn
our
doctrine
and
want
to
kill
us
we
in
turn
hate
and
condemn
their
cursed
doctrine
in
the
meanwhile
the
people
are
uncertain
whom
to
follow
and
which
way
to
turn
for
it
is
not
given
to
everybody
to
judge
these
matters
but
the
truth
will
win
out
so
much
is
certain
we
persecute
no
man
neither
does
our
doctrine
trouble
men
on
the
contrary
we
have
the
testimony
of
many
good
men
who
thank
god
on
their
knees
for
the
consolation
that
our
doctrine
has
brought
them
like
paul
we
are
not
to
blame
that
the
churches
have
trouble
the
fault
lies
with
the
anabaptists
and
other
fanatics
every
teacher
of
is
a
has
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
the
pope
cardinals
bishops
monks
and
that
the
whole
synagogue
of
satan
are
the
truth
is
they
are
worse
than
false
apostles
the
false
apostles
taught
that
in
addition
to
faith
in
christ
the
works
of
the
law
of
god
were
necessary
unto
salvation
but
the
papists
omit
faith
altogether
and
teach
traditions
and
works
that
are
not
commanded
of
god
indeed
are
contrary
to
the
word
of
god
and
for
these
traditions
they
demand
preferred
attention
and
obedience
paul
calls
the
false
apostles
troublers
of
the
church
because
they
taught
circumcision
and
the
keeping
of
the
law
as
needful
unto
salvation
they
insisted
that
the
law
must
be
observed
in
every
detail
they
were
supporters
in
this
contention
by
the
jews
with
the
result
that
those
who
were
not
firmly
established
in
faith
were
easily
persuaded
that
paul
was
not
a
sincere
teacher
of
god
because
he
ignored
the
law
the
jews
were
offended
at
the
idea
that
the
law
of
god
should
be
entirely
ignored
by
paul
and
that
the
gentiles
former
should
gratuitously
attain
to
the
station
of
people
without
circumcision
without
the
penitentiary
performance
of
the
law
by
grace
alone
through
faith
in
christ
jesus
these
criticisms
were
amplified
by
the
false
apostles
they
accused
paul
of
designs
to
abolish
the
law
of
god
and
the
jewish
dispensation
contrary
to
the
law
of
god
contrary
to
their
jewish
heritage
contrary
to
apostolic
example
contrary
to
paul
own
example
they
demanded
that
paul
be
shunned
as
a
blasphemer
and
a
rebel
while
they
were
to
be
heard
as
true
teachers
of
the
gospel
and
authentic
disciples
of
the
apostles
thus
paul
stood
defamed
among
the
galatians
he
was
forced
to
attack
the
false
apostles
he
did
so
without
hesitation
verse
and
would
pervert
the
gospel
of
christ
to
paraphrase
this
sentence
these
false
apostles
do
not
merely
trouble
you
they
abolish
christ
gospel
they
act
as
if
they
were
the
only
true
for
all
that
they
muddle
law
and
gospel
as
a
result
they
pervert
the
gospel
either
christ
must
live
and
the
law
perish
or
the
law
remains
and
christ
must
perish
christ
and
the
law
can
not
dwell
side
by
side
in
the
conscience
it
is
either
grace
or
law
to
muddle
the
two
is
to
eliminate
the
gospel
of
christ
entirely
it
seems
a
small
matter
to
mingle
the
law
and
gospel
faith
and
works
but
it
creates
more
mischief
than
man
brain
can
conceive
to
mix
law
and
gospel
not
only
clouds
the
knowledge
of
grace
it
cuts
out
christ
altogether
the
words
of
paul
and
would
pervert
the
gospel
of
christ
also
indicate
how
arrogant
these
false
apostles
were
they
were
shameless
boasters
paul
simply
had
to
exalt
his
own
ministry
and
gospel
verse
but
though
we
or
an
angel
from
heaven
preach
any
other
gospel
unto
you
than
that
which
we
have
preached
unto
you
let
him
be
accursed
paul
zeal
for
the
gospel
becomes
so
fervent
that
it
almost
leads
him
to
curse
angels
i
would
rather
that
i
my
brethren
yes
the
angels
of
heaven
be
anathematized
than
that
my
gospel
be
overthrown
the
greek
word
hebrew
means
to
accurse
execrate
to
damn
paul
first
hypothetically
curses
himself
knowing
persons
first
find
fault
with
themselves
in
order
that
they
may
all
the
more
earnestly
reprove
others
paul
maintains
that
there
is
no
other
gospel
besides
the
one
he
had
preached
to
the
galatians
he
preached
not
a
gospel
of
his
own
invention
but
the
very
same
gospel
god
had
long
ago
prescribed
in
the
sacred
scriptures
no
wonder
paul
pronounces
curses
upon
himself
and
upon
others
upon
the
angels
of
heaven
if
anyone
should
dare
to
preach
any
other
gospel
than
christ
own
verse
as
we
said
before
so
say
i
now
again
if
any
man
preach
any
other
gospel
unto
you
than
that
ye
have
received
let
him
be
accursed
paul
repeats
the
curse
directing
it
now
upon
other
persons
before
he
cursed
himself
his
brethren
and
an
angel
from
heaven
now
he
says
if
there
are
any
others
who
preach
a
gospel
different
from
that
you
have
received
from
us
let
them
also
be
accursed
paul
herewith
curses
and
excommunicates
all
false
teachers
including
his
opponents
he
is
so
worked
up
that
he
dares
to
curse
all
who
pervert
his
gospel
would
to
god
that
this
terrible
pronouncement
of
the
apostle
might
strike
fear
into
the
hearts
of
all
who
pervert
the
gospel
of
paul
the
galatians
might
say
paul
we
do
not
pervert
the
gospel
you
have
brought
unto
us
we
did
not
quite
understand
it
that
is
all
now
these
teachers
who
came
after
you
have
explained
everything
so
beautifully
this
explanation
the
apostle
refuses
to
accept
they
must
add
nothing
they
must
correct
nothing
what
you
received
from
me
is
the
genuine
gospel
of
god
let
it
stand
if
any
man
brings
any
other
gospel
than
the
one
i
brought
you
or
promises
to
deliver
better
things
than
you
have
received
from
me
let
him
be
accursed
in
spite
of
this
emphatic
denunciation
so
many
accept
the
pope
as
the
supreme
judge
of
the
scriptures
the
church
they
say
chose
only
four
gospels
the
church
might
have
chosen
more
ergo
the
church
is
above
the
gospel
with
equal
force
one
might
argue
i
approve
the
scriptures
ergo
i
am
above
the
scriptures
john
the
baptist
confessed
christ
hence
he
is
above
christ
paul
subordinates
himself
all
preachers
all
the
angels
of
heaven
everybody
to
the
sacred
scriptures
we
are
not
the
masters
judges
or
arbiters
but
witnesses
disciples
and
confessors
of
the
scriptures
whether
we
be
pope
luther
augustine
paul
or
an
angel
from
heaven
verse
for
do
i
now
persuade
men
or
god
with
the
same
vehemence
paul
continues
you
galatians
ought
to
be
able
to
tell
from
my
preaching
and
from
the
many
afflictions
which
i
have
endured
whether
i
serve
men
or
god
everybody
can
see
that
my
preaching
has
stirred
up
persecution
against
me
everywhere
and
has
earned
for
me
the
cruel
hatred
of
my
own
people
in
fact
the
hatred
of
all
men
this
should
convince
you
that
by
my
preaching
i
do
not
seek
the
favor
and
praise
of
men
but
the
glory
of
god
no
man
can
say
that
we
are
seeking
the
favor
and
praise
of
men
with
our
doctrine
we
teach
that
all
men
are
naturally
depraved
we
condemn
man
free
will
his
strength
wisdom
and
righteousness
we
say
that
we
obtain
grace
by
the
free
mercy
of
god
alone
for
christ
sake
this
is
no
preaching
to
please
men
this
sort
of
preaching
procures
for
us
the
hatred
and
disfavor
of
the
world
persecutions
excommunications
murders
and
curses
ca
you
see
that
i
seek
no
man
favor
by
my
doctrine
asks
paul
if
i
were
anxious
for
the
favor
of
men
i
would
flatter
them
but
what
do
i
do
i
condemn
their
works
i
teach
things
only
that
i
have
been
commanded
to
teach
from
above
for
that
i
bring
down
upon
my
head
the
wrath
of
jews
and
gentiles
my
doctrine
must
be
right
it
must
be
divine
any
other
doctrine
can
not
be
better
than
mine
any
other
doctrine
must
be
false
and
wicked
with
paul
we
boldly
pronounce
a
curse
upon
every
doctrine
that
does
not
agree
with
ours
we
do
not
preach
for
the
praise
of
men
or
the
favor
of
princes
we
preach
for
the
favor
of
god
alone
whose
grace
and
mercy
we
proclaim
whosoever
teaches
a
gospel
contrary
to
ours
or
different
from
ours
let
us
be
bold
to
say
that
he
is
sent
of
the
devil
verse
or
do
i
seek
to
please
men
do
i
serve
men
or
god
paul
keeps
an
eye
on
the
false
apostles
those
flatterers
of
men
they
taught
circumcision
to
avoid
the
hatred
and
persecution
of
men
to
this
day
you
will
find
many
who
seek
to
please
men
in
order
that
they
may
live
in
peace
and
security
they
teach
whatever
is
agreeable
to
men
no
matter
whether
it
is
contrary
to
god
word
or
their
own
conscience
but
we
who
endeavor
to
please
god
and
not
men
stir
up
hell
itself
we
must
suffer
reproach
slanders
death
for
those
who
go
about
to
please
men
we
have
a
word
from
christ
recorded
in
the
fifth
chapter
of
john
how
can
ye
believe
which
receive
honor
one
of
another
and
seek
not
the
honor
that
cometh
from
god
alone
verse
for
if
i
yet
pleased
men
i
should
not
be
the
servant
of
christ
observe
the
consummate
cleverness
with
which
the
false
apostles
went
about
to
bring
paul
into
disrepute
they
combed
paul
writings
for
contradictions
our
opponents
do
the
same
to
accuse
him
of
teaching
contradictory
things
they
found
that
paul
had
circumcised
timothy
according
to
the
law
that
paul
had
purified
himself
with
four
other
men
in
the
temple
at
jerusalem
that
paul
had
shaven
his
head
at
cenchrea
the
false
apostles
slyly
suggested
that
paul
had
been
constrained
by
the
other
apostles
to
observe
these
ceremonial
laws
we
know
that
paul
observed
these
out
of
charitable
regard
for
the
weak
brethren
he
did
not
want
to
offend
them
but
the
false
apostles
turned
charitable
regard
to
his
disadvantage
if
paul
had
preached
the
law
and
circumcision
if
he
had
commended
the
strength
and
free
will
of
man
he
would
not
have
been
so
obnoxious
to
the
jews
on
the
contrary
they
would
have
praised
his
every
action
verses
but
i
certify
you
brethren
that
the
gospel
which
was
preached
of
me
is
not
after
man
for
i
neither
received
it
of
man
neither
was
i
taught
it
but
by
the
revelation
of
jesus
christ
this
passage
constitutes
paul
chief
defense
against
the
accusations
of
his
opponents
he
maintains
under
oath
that
he
received
his
gospel
not
from
men
but
by
the
revelation
of
jesus
christ
in
declaring
that
his
gospel
is
not
after
man
paul
does
not
merely
wish
to
state
that
his
gospel
is
not
mundane
the
false
apostles
made
the
same
claim
for
their
gospel
paul
means
to
say
that
he
learned
his
gospel
not
in
the
usual
and
accepted
manner
through
the
agency
of
men
by
hearing
reading
or
writing
he
received
the
gospel
by
special
revelation
directly
from
jesus
christ
paul
received
his
gospel
on
the
way
to
damascus
when
christ
appeared
to
him
luke
furnishes
an
account
of
the
incident
in
the
ninth
chapter
of
the
book
of
acts
arise
said
christ
to
paul
and
go
into
the
city
and
it
shall
be
told
thee
what
thou
must
do
christ
did
not
send
paul
into
the
city
to
learn
the
gospel
from
ananias
ananias
was
only
to
baptize
paul
to
lay
his
hands
on
paul
to
commit
the
ministry
of
the
word
unto
paul
and
to
recommend
him
to
the
church
ananias
recognized
his
limited
assignment
when
he
said
to
paul
brother
saul
the
lord
even
jesus
that
appeared
unto
thee
in
the
way
as
thou
camest
hath
sent
me
that
thou
mightest
receive
thy
sight
and
be
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
paul
did
not
receive
instruction
from
ananias
paul
had
already
been
called
enlightened
and
taught
by
christ
in
the
road
his
contact
with
ananias
was
merely
a
testimonial
to
the
fact
that
paul
had
been
called
by
christ
to
preach
the
gospel
paul
was
forced
to
speak
of
his
conversion
to
combat
the
slanderous
contention
of
the
false
apostles
to
the
effect
that
this
apostleship
was
inferior
to
that
of
the
other
apostles
if
it
were
not
for
the
example
of
the
galatian
churches
i
would
never
have
thought
it
possible
that
anybody
who
had
received
the
word
of
god
with
such
eagerness
as
they
had
could
so
quickly
let
go
of
it
good
lord
what
terrible
mischief
one
single
false
statement
can
create
the
article
of
justification
is
fragile
not
in
itself
of
course
but
in
us
i
know
how
quickly
a
person
can
forfeit
the
joy
of
the
gospel
i
know
in
what
slippery
places
even
those
stand
who
seem
to
have
a
good
footing
in
the
matters
of
faith
in
the
midst
of
the
conflict
when
we
should
be
consoling
ourselves
with
the
gospel
the
law
rears
up
and
begins
to
rage
all
over
our
conscience
i
say
the
gospel
is
frail
because
we
are
frail
what
makes
matters
worse
is
that
of
ourselves
our
own
reason
stands
against
us
the
flesh
resists
the
spirit
or
as
paul
puts
it
the
flesh
lusteth
against
the
spirit
therefore
we
teach
that
to
know
christ
and
to
believe
in
him
is
no
achievement
of
man
but
the
gift
of
god
god
alone
can
create
and
preserve
faith
in
us
god
creates
faith
in
us
through
the
word
he
increases
strengthens
and
confirms
faith
in
us
through
his
word
hence
the
best
service
that
anybody
can
render
god
is
diligently
to
hear
and
read
god
word
on
the
other
hand
nothing
is
more
perilous
than
to
be
weary
of
the
word
of
god
thinking
he
knows
enough
a
person
begins
little
by
little
to
despise
the
word
until
he
has
lost
christ
and
the
gospel
altogether
let
every
believer
carefully
learn
the
gospel
let
him
continue
in
humble
prayer
we
are
molested
not
by
puny
foes
but
by
mighty
ones
foes
who
never
grow
tired
of
warring
against
us
these
our
enemies
are
many
our
own
flesh
the
world
the
law
sin
death
the
wrath
and
judgment
of
god
and
the
devil
himself
the
arguments
which
the
false
apostles
advanced
impress
people
to
this
day
who
are
you
to
dissent
from
the
fathers
and
the
entire
church
and
to
bring
a
contradictory
doctrine
are
you
wiser
than
so
many
holy
men
wiser
than
the
whole
church
when
satan
abetted
by
our
own
reason
advances
these
arguments
against
us
we
lose
heart
unless
we
keep
on
saying
to
ourselves
i
do
care
if
cyprian
ambrose
augustine
peter
paul
john
or
an
angel
from
heaven
teaches
so
and
so
i
know
that
i
teach
the
truth
of
god
in
christ
jesus
when
i
first
took
over
the
defense
of
the
gospel
i
remembered
what
doctor
staupitz
said
to
me
i
like
it
well
he
said
that
the
doctrine
which
you
proclaim
gives
glory
to
god
alone
and
none
to
man
for
never
can
too
much
glory
goodness
and
mercy
be
ascribed
unto
god
these
words
of
the
worthy
doctor
comforted
and
confirmed
me
the
gospel
is
true
because
it
deprives
men
of
all
glory
wisdom
and
righteousness
and
turns
over
all
honor
to
the
creator
alone
it
is
safer
to
attribute
too
much
glory
unto
god
than
unto
man
you
may
argue
that
the
church
and
the
fathers
are
holy
yet
the
church
is
compelled
to
pray
forgive
us
our
trespasses
i
am
not
to
be
believed
nor
is
the
church
to
be
believed
or
the
fathers
or
the
apostles
or
an
angel
from
heaven
if
they
teach
anything
contrary
to
the
word
of
god
let
the
word
of
god
abide
forever
peter
erred
in
life
and
in
doctrine
paul
might
have
dismissed
error
as
a
matter
of
no
consequence
but
paul
saw
that
peter
error
would
lead
to
the
damage
of
the
whole
church
unless
it
were
corrected
therefore
he
withstood
peter
to
his
face
the
church
peter
the
apostles
angels
from
heaven
are
not
to
be
heard
unless
they
teach
the
genuine
word
of
god
this
argument
is
not
always
to
our
advantage
people
ask
whom
then
shall
we
believe
our
opponents
maintain
that
they
teach
the
pure
word
of
god
we
do
not
believe
them
they
in
turn
hate
and
persecute
us
for
vile
heretics
what
can
we
do
about
it
with
paul
we
glory
in
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
what
do
we
gain
we
are
told
that
our
glorying
is
idle
vanity
and
unadulterated
blasphemy
the
moment
we
abase
ourselves
and
give
in
to
the
rage
of
our
opponents
papists
and
anabaptists
grow
arrogant
the
anabaptists
hatch
out
some
new
monstrosity
the
papists
revive
their
old
abominations
what
to
do
let
everybody
become
sure
of
his
calling
and
doctrine
that
he
may
boldly
say
with
paul
but
though
we
or
an
angel
from
heaven
preach
any
other
gospel
unto
you
than
ye
have
received
let
him
be
accursed
verses
for
ye
have
heard
of
my
conversation
in
time
past
in
the
jews
religion
how
that
beyond
measure
i
persecuted
the
church
of
god
and
wasted
it
and
profited
in
the
jews
religion
above
many
my
equals
in
mine
own
nation
this
passage
does
not
contain
doctrine
paul
adduces
his
own
case
for
an
example
i
have
he
says
at
one
time
defended
the
traditions
of
the
pharisees
more
fiercely
than
any
of
your
false
apostles
now
if
the
righteousness
of
the
law
had
been
worth
anything
i
would
never
have
forsaken
it
so
carefully
did
i
live
up
to
the
law
that
i
excelled
many
of
my
companions
so
zealous
was
i
in
defense
of
the
law
that
i
wasted
the
church
of
god
verse
being
more
exceedingly
zealous
of
the
traditions
of
my
fathers
speaking
now
of
the
mosaic
law
paul
declares
that
he
was
wrapped
up
in
it
to
the
philippians
he
wrote
as
touching
the
law
a
pharisee
concerning
zeal
persecuting
the
church
touching
the
righteousness
which
is
in
the
law
blameless
he
means
to
say
i
can
compare
myself
with
the
best
and
holiest
of
all
those
who
are
of
the
circumcision
let
them
show
me
if
they
can
a
more
earnest
defender
of
the
mosaic
law
than
i
was
at
one
time
this
fact
o
galatians
should
have
put
you
on
your
guard
against
these
deceivers
who
make
so
much
of
the
law
if
anybody
ever
had
reason
to
glory
in
the
righteousness
of
the
law
it
was
i
i
too
may
say
that
before
i
was
enlightened
by
the
gospel
i
was
as
zealous
for
the
papistical
laws
and
traditions
of
the
fathers
as
ever
a
man
was
i
tried
hard
to
live
up
to
every
law
as
best
i
could
i
punished
myself
with
fasting
watching
praying
and
other
exercises
more
than
all
those
who
today
hate
and
persecute
me
i
was
so
much
in
earnest
that
i
imposed
upon
my
body
more
than
it
could
stand
i
honored
the
pope
as
a
matter
of
conscience
whatever
i
did
i
did
with
a
single
heart
to
the
glory
of
god
but
our
opponents
idlers
that
they
are
will
not
believe
what
i
and
many
others
have
endured
verses
but
when
it
pleased
god
who
separated
me
from
my
mother
womb
and
called
me
by
his
grace
to
reveal
his
son
in
me
that
i
might
preach
him
among
the
heathen
immediately
i
conferred
not
with
flesh
and
blood
neither
went
i
up
to
jerusalem
to
them
which
were
apostles
before
me
but
i
went
into
arabia
and
returned
again
unto
damascus
here
paul
relates
that
immediately
upon
being
called
by
god
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
gentiles
he
went
into
arabia
without
consulting
a
single
person
when
it
had
pleased
god
he
writes
i
did
not
deserve
it
i
had
been
an
enemy
of
christ
i
had
blasphemed
his
gospel
i
had
shed
innocent
blood
in
the
midst
of
my
frenzy
i
was
called
why
on
account
of
my
outrageous
cruelty
indeed
not
my
gracious
god
who
shows
mercy
unto
whom
he
will
pardoned
all
mine
iniquities
he
bestowed
his
grace
upon
me
and
called
me
for
an
apostle
we
also
have
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
by
the
same
kindness
of
god
i
crucified
christ
daily
in
my
cloistered
life
and
blasphemed
god
by
my
wrong
faith
outwardly
i
kept
myself
chaste
poor
and
obedient
i
was
much
given
to
fasting
watching
praying
saying
of
masses
and
the
like
yet
under
the
cloak
of
my
outward
respectability
i
continually
mistrusted
doubted
feared
hated
and
blasphemed
god
my
righteousness
was
a
filthy
puddle
satan
loves
such
saints
they
are
his
darlings
for
they
quickly
destroy
their
body
and
soul
by
depriving
them
of
the
blessings
of
god
generous
gifts
i
tell
you
i
stood
in
awe
of
the
pope
authority
to
dissent
from
him
i
considered
a
crime
worthy
of
eternal
death
i
thought
of
john
huss
as
a
cursed
heretic
i
counted
it
a
sin
even
to
think
of
him
i
would
gladly
have
furnished
the
wood
to
burn
him
i
would
have
felt
i
had
done
god
a
real
service
in
comparison
with
these
sanctimonious
hypocrites
of
the
papacy
publicans
and
harlots
are
not
bad
they
at
least
feel
remorse
they
at
least
do
not
try
to
justify
their
wicked
deeds
but
these
pretended
saints
so
far
from
acknowledging
their
errors
justify
them
and
regard
them
as
acceptable
sacrifices
unto
god
verse
when
it
pleased
god
by
the
favor
of
god
i
a
wicked
and
cursed
wretch
a
blasphemer
persecutor
and
rebel
was
spared
not
content
to
spare
me
god
granted
unto
me
the
knowledge
of
his
salvation
his
spirit
his
son
the
office
of
an
apostle
everlasting
life
paul
speaking
god
not
only
pardoned
our
iniquities
but
in
addition
overwhelmed
us
with
blessings
and
spiritual
gifts
many
however
are
ungrateful
worse
by
opening
again
a
window
to
the
devil
many
begin
to
loathe
word
and
end
by
perverting
the
gospel
verse
who
separated
me
from
my
mother
womb
this
is
a
hebrew
expression
meaning
to
sanctify
ordain
prepare
paul
is
saying
when
i
was
not
yet
born
god
ordained
me
to
be
an
apostle
and
in
due
time
confirmed
my
apostleship
before
the
world
every
gift
be
it
small
or
great
spiritual
or
temporal
and
every
good
thing
i
should
ever
do
god
has
ordained
while
i
was
yet
in
my
mother
womb
where
i
could
neither
think
nor
perform
any
good
thing
after
i
was
born
god
supported
me
heaping
mercy
upon
mercy
he
freely
forgave
my
sins
replenishing
me
with
his
grace
to
enable
me
to
learn
what
great
things
are
ours
in
christ
to
crown
it
all
he
called
me
to
preach
the
gospel
to
others
verse
and
called
me
by
his
grace
did
god
call
me
on
account
of
my
holy
life
or
on
account
of
my
pharisaical
religion
or
on
account
of
my
prayers
fastings
and
works
never
well
then
it
is
certain
god
did
not
call
me
on
account
of
my
blasphemies
persecutions
oppressions
what
prompted
him
to
call
me
his
grace
alone
verse
to
reveal
his
son
to
me
we
now
hear
what
kind
of
doctrine
was
committed
to
paul
the
doctrine
of
the
gospel
the
doctrine
of
the
revelation
of
the
son
of
god
this
doctrine
differs
greatly
from
the
law
the
law
terrorizes
the
conscience
the
law
reveals
the
wrath
and
judgment
of
god
the
gospel
does
not
threaten
the
gospel
announces
that
christ
is
come
to
forgive
the
sins
of
the
world
the
gospel
conveys
to
us
the
inestimable
treasures
of
god
verse
that
i
might
preach
him
among
the
heathen
it
pleased
god
says
the
apostle
to
reveal
himself
in
me
why
for
a
twofold
purpose
that
i
personally
should
believe
in
the
son
of
god
and
that
i
should
reveal
him
to
the
gentiles
paul
does
not
mention
the
jews
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
was
the
called
and
acknowledged
apostle
of
the
gentiles
although
he
preached
christ
also
to
the
jews
we
can
hear
the
apostle
saying
to
himself
i
will
not
burden
the
gentiles
with
the
law
because
i
am
their
apostle
and
not
their
lawgiver
not
once
did
you
galatians
hear
me
speak
of
the
righteousness
of
the
law
or
of
works
my
job
was
to
bring
you
the
gospel
therefore
you
ought
to
listen
to
no
teachers
of
the
law
but
the
gospel
not
moses
but
the
son
of
god
not
the
righteousness
of
works
but
the
righteousness
of
faith
must
be
proclaimed
to
the
gentiles
that
is
the
right
kind
of
preaching
for
gentiles
verse
immediately
i
conferred
not
with
flesh
and
blood
once
paul
had
received
the
gospel
from
christ
he
conferred
with
nobody
in
damascus
he
asked
no
man
to
teach
him
he
did
not
go
up
to
jerusalem
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
peter
and
the
other
apostles
at
once
he
preached
jesus
christ
in
damascus
verse
neither
went
i
up
to
jerusalem
to
them
which
were
apostles
before
me
but
i
went
into
arabia
and
returned
again
unto
damascus
i
went
to
arabia
before
i
saw
any
of
the
apostles
i
took
it
upon
myself
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
gentiles
without
delay
because
christ
had
called
me
for
that
purpose
this
statement
refutes
the
assertion
of
the
false
apostles
that
paul
had
been
a
pupil
of
the
apostles
from
which
the
false
apostles
inferred
that
paul
had
been
instructed
in
the
obedience
of
the
law
that
therefore
the
gentiles
also
ought
to
keep
the
law
and
submit
to
circumcision
verses
then
after
three
years
i
went
up
to
jerusalem
to
see
peter
and
abode
with
him
fifteen
days
but
other
of
the
apostles
saw
i
none
save
james
the
lord
brother
paul
minutely
recounts
his
personal
history
to
stop
the
cavil
of
the
false
apostles
paul
does
not
deny
that
he
had
been
with
some
of
the
apostles
he
went
to
jerusalem
uninvited
not
to
be
instructed
but
to
visit
with
peter
luke
reports
the
occasion
in
the
ninth
chapter
of
the
book
of
acts
barnabas
introduced
paul
to
the
apostles
and
related
to
them
how
paul
had
met
the
lord
jesus
on
the
way
to
damascus
also
how
paul
had
preached
boldly
at
damascus
in
the
name
of
jesus
paul
says
that
he
saw
peter
and
james
but
he
denies
that
he
learned
anything
from
them
why
does
paul
harp
on
this
seemingly
unimportant
fact
to
convince
the
churches
of
galatia
that
his
gospel
was
the
true
word
of
christ
which
he
learned
from
christ
himself
and
from
no
man
paul
was
forced
to
affirm
and
this
fact
his
usefulness
to
all
the
churches
that
had
used
him
as
their
pastor
and
teacher
was
at
stake
verse
now
the
things
which
i
write
unto
you
behold
before
god
i
lie
not
was
it
necessary
for
paul
to
go
under
oath
yes
paul
is
reporting
personal
history
how
else
would
the
churches
believe
him
the
false
apostles
might
say
who
knows
whether
paul
is
telling
the
truth
paul
the
elect
vessel
of
god
was
held
in
so
little
esteem
by
his
own
galatians
to
whom
he
had
preached
christ
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
swear
an
oath
that
he
spoke
the
truth
if
this
happened
to
paul
what
business
have
we
to
complain
when
people
doubt
our
words
or
hold
us
in
little
regard
we
who
can
not
begin
to
compare
ourselves
with
the
apostle
verse
afterwards
i
came
into
the
regions
of
syria
and
cilicia
syria
and
cilicia
are
adjacent
countries
paul
traces
his
movements
carefully
in
order
to
convince
the
galatians
that
he
had
never
been
the
disciple
of
any
apostle
verses
and
was
unknown
by
face
unto
the
churches
of
judaea
which
were
in
christ
but
they
had
heard
only
that
he
which
persecuted
us
in
times
past
now
preacheth
the
faith
which
once
he
destroyed
and
they
glorified
god
in
me
in
syria
and
cilicia
paul
won
the
indorsement
of
all
the
churches
of
judea
by
his
preaching
all
the
churches
everywhere
even
those
of
judea
could
testify
that
he
had
preached
the
same
faith
everywhere
and
paul
adds
these
churches
glorified
god
in
me
not
because
i
taught
that
circumcision
and
the
law
of
moses
should
be
observed
but
because
i
urged
upon
all
faith
in
the
lord
jesus
christ
chapter
verse
then
fourteen
years
after
i
went
up
again
to
jerusalem
paul
taught
justification
by
faith
in
christ
jesus
without
the
deeds
of
the
law
he
reported
this
to
the
disciples
at
antioch
among
the
disciples
were
some
that
had
been
brought
up
in
the
ancient
customs
of
the
jews
these
rose
against
paul
in
quick
indignation
accusing
him
of
propagating
a
gospel
of
lawlessness
great
dissension
followed
paul
and
barnabas
stood
up
for
the
truth
they
testified
wherever
we
preached
to
the
gentiles
the
holy
ghost
came
upon
those
who
received
the
word
this
happened
everywhere
we
preached
not
circumcision
we
did
not
require
observance
of
the
law
we
preached
faith
in
jesus
christ
at
our
preaching
of
faith
god
gave
to
the
hearers
the
holy
ghost
from
this
fact
paul
and
barnabas
inferred
that
the
holy
ghost
approved
the
faith
of
the
gentiles
without
the
law
and
circumcision
if
the
faith
of
the
gentiles
had
not
pleased
the
holy
ghost
he
would
not
have
manifested
his
presence
in
the
uncircumcised
hearers
of
the
word
unconvinced
the
jews
fiercely
opposed
paul
asserting
that
the
law
ought
to
be
kept
and
that
the
gentiles
ought
to
be
circumcised
or
else
they
could
not
be
saved
when
we
consider
the
obstinacy
with
which
romanists
cling
to
their
traditions
we
can
very
well
understand
the
zealous
devotion
of
the
jews
for
the
law
after
all
they
had
received
the
law
from
god
we
can
understand
how
impossible
it
was
for
recent
converts
from
judaism
suddenly
to
break
with
the
law
for
that
matter
god
did
bear
with
them
as
he
bore
with
the
infirmity
of
israel
when
the
people
halted
between
two
religions
was
not
god
patient
with
us
also
while
we
were
blindfolded
by
the
papacy
god
is
longsuffering
and
full
of
mercy
but
we
dare
not
abuse
the
patience
of
the
lord
we
dare
no
longer
continue
in
error
now
that
the
truth
has
been
revealed
in
the
gospel
the
opponents
of
paul
had
his
own
example
to
prefer
against
him
paul
had
circumcised
timothy
paul
defended
his
action
on
the
ground
that
he
had
circumcised
timothy
not
from
compulsion
but
from
christian
love
lest
the
weak
in
faith
should
be
offended
his
opponents
would
not
accept
paul
explanation
when
paul
saw
that
the
quarrel
was
getting
out
of
hand
he
obeyed
the
direction
of
god
and
left
for
jerusalem
there
to
confer
with
the
other
apostles
he
did
this
not
for
his
own
sake
but
for
the
sake
of
the
people
verse
with
barnabas
and
took
titus
with
me
also
paul
chose
two
witnesses
barnabas
and
titus
barnabas
had
been
preaching
companion
to
the
gentiles
barnabas
was
an
of
the
fact
that
the
holy
ghost
had
come
upon
the
gentiles
in
response
to
the
simple
preaching
of
faith
in
jesus
christ
barnabas
stuck
to
paul
on
this
point
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
gentiles
to
be
bothered
with
the
law
as
long
as
they
believed
in
christ
titus
was
superintendent
of
the
churches
in
crete
having
been
placed
in
charge
of
the
churches
by
paul
titus
was
a
former
gentile
verse
and
i
went
up
by
revelation
if
god
had
not
ordered
paul
to
jerusalem
paul
would
never
have
gone
there
verse
and
communicated
unto
them
that
gospel
after
an
absence
of
fourteen
years
respectively
eighteen
years
paul
returned
to
jerusalem
to
confer
with
the
other
apostles
verse
which
i
preach
among
the
gentiles
among
the
jews
paul
allowed
law
and
circumcision
to
stand
for
the
time
being
so
did
all
the
apostles
nevertheless
paul
held
fast
to
the
liberty
of
the
gospel
on
one
occasion
he
said
to
the
jews
through
this
man
christ
is
preached
unto
you
forgiveness
of
sins
and
by
him
all
that
believe
are
justified
from
all
things
from
which
ye
could
not
be
justified
by
the
law
of
moses
acts
always
remembering
the
weak
paul
did
not
insist
that
they
break
at
once
with
the
law
paul
admits
that
he
conferred
with
the
apostles
concerning
his
gospel
but
he
denies
that
the
conference
benefited
or
taught
him
anything
the
fact
is
he
resisted
those
who
wanted
to
force
the
practice
of
the
law
upon
the
gentiles
they
did
not
overcome
him
he
overcame
them
your
false
apostles
lie
when
they
say
that
i
circumcised
timothy
shaved
my
head
in
cenchrea
and
went
up
to
jerusalem
at
the
request
of
the
apostles
i
went
to
jerusalem
at
the
request
of
god
what
is
more
i
won
the
indorsement
of
the
apostles
my
opponents
lost
out
the
matter
upon
which
the
apostles
deliberated
in
conference
was
this
is
the
observance
of
the
law
requisite
unto
justification
paul
answered
i
have
preached
faith
in
christ
to
the
gentiles
and
not
the
law
if
the
jews
want
to
keep
the
law
and
be
circumcised
very
well
as
long
as
they
do
so
from
a
right
motive
verse
but
privately
to
them
which
were
of
reputation
this
is
to
say
i
conferred
not
only
with
the
brethren
but
with
the
leaders
among
them
verse
lest
by
any
means
i
should
run
or
had
run
in
vain
not
that
paul
himself
ever
thought
he
had
run
in
vain
however
many
did
think
that
paul
had
preached
the
gospel
in
vain
because
he
kept
the
gentiles
free
from
the
yoke
of
the
law
the
opinion
that
obedience
to
the
law
was
mandatory
unto
salvation
was
gaining
ground
paul
meant
to
remedy
this
evil
by
this
conference
he
hoped
to
establish
the
identity
of
his
gospel
with
that
of
the
other
apostles
to
stop
the
talk
of
his
opponents
that
he
had
been
running
around
in
vain
verse
but
neither
titus
who
was
with
me
being
a
greek
was
compelled
to
be
circumcised
the
word
compelled
acquaints
us
with
the
outcome
of
the
conference
it
was
resolved
that
the
gentiles
should
not
be
compelled
to
be
circumcised
paul
did
not
condemn
circumcision
in
itself
neither
by
word
nor
deed
did
he
ever
inveigh
against
circumcision
but
he
did
protest
against
circumcision
being
made
a
condition
for
salvation
he
cited
the
case
of
the
fathers
the
fathers
were
not
justified
by
circumcision
it
was
to
them
a
sign
and
seal
of
righteousness
they
looked
upon
circumcision
as
a
confession
of
their
faith
the
believing
jews
however
could
not
get
it
through
their
heads
that
circumcision
was
not
necessary
for
salvation
they
were
encouraged
in
their
wrong
attitude
by
the
false
apostles
the
result
was
that
the
people
were
up
in
arms
against
paul
and
his
doctrine
paul
did
not
condemn
circumcision
as
if
it
were
a
sin
to
receive
it
but
he
insisted
and
the
conference
upheld
him
that
circumcision
had
no
bearing
upon
salvation
and
was
therefore
not
to
be
forced
upon
the
gentiles
the
conference
agreed
that
the
jews
should
be
permitted
to
keep
their
ancient
customs
for
the
time
being
so
long
as
they
did
not
regard
those
customs
as
conveying
god
justification
of
the
sinner
the
false
apostles
were
dissatisfied
with
the
verdict
of
the
conference
they
did
not
want
to
rest
circumcision
and
the
practice
of
the
law
in
christian
liberty
they
insisted
that
circumcision
was
obligatory
unto
salvation
as
the
opponents
of
paul
so
our
own
adversaries
luther
the
enemies
of
the
reformation
contend
that
the
traditions
of
the
fathers
dare
not
be
neglected
without
loss
of
salvation
our
opponents
will
not
agree
with
us
on
anything
they
defend
their
blasphemies
they
go
as
far
to
enforce
them
with
the
sword
paul
victory
was
complete
titus
who
was
with
paul
was
not
compelled
to
be
circumcised
although
he
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
apostles
when
this
question
of
circumcision
was
debated
this
was
a
blow
to
the
false
apostles
with
the
living
fact
that
titus
was
not
compelled
to
be
circumcised
paul
was
able
to
squelch
his
adversaries
verses
and
that
because
of
false
brethren
unawares
brought
in
who
came
in
privily
to
spy
out
our
liberty
which
we
have
in
christ
jesus
that
they
might
bring
us
into
bondage
to
whom
we
gave
place
by
subjection
no
not
for
an
hour
that
the
truth
of
the
gospel
might
continue
with
you
paul
here
explains
his
motive
for
going
up
to
jerusalem
he
did
not
go
to
jerusalem
to
be
instructed
or
confirmed
in
his
gospel
by
the
other
apostles
he
went
to
jerusalem
in
order
to
preserve
the
true
gospel
for
the
galatian
churches
and
for
all
the
churches
of
the
gentiles
when
paul
speaks
of
the
truth
of
the
gospel
he
implies
by
contrast
a
false
gospel
the
false
apostles
also
had
a
gospel
but
it
was
an
untrue
gospel
in
holding
out
against
them
says
paul
i
conserved
the
truth
of
the
pure
gospel
now
the
true
gospel
has
it
that
we
are
justified
by
faith
alone
without
the
deeds
of
the
law
the
false
gospel
has
it
that
we
are
justified
by
faith
but
not
without
the
deeds
of
the
law
the
false
apostles
preached
a
conditional
gospel
so
do
the
papists
they
admit
that
faith
is
the
foundation
of
salvation
but
they
add
the
conditional
clause
that
faith
can
save
only
when
it
is
furnished
with
good
works
this
is
wrong
the
true
gospel
declares
that
good
works
are
the
embellishment
of
faith
but
that
faith
itself
is
the
gift
and
work
of
god
in
our
hearts
faith
is
able
to
justify
because
it
apprehends
christ
the
redeemer
human
reason
can
think
only
in
terms
of
the
law
it
mumbles
this
i
have
done
this
i
have
not
done
but
faith
looks
to
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
given
into
death
for
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
to
turn
one
eyes
away
from
jesus
means
to
turn
them
to
the
law
true
faith
lays
hold
of
christ
and
leans
on
him
alone
our
opponents
can
not
understand
this
in
their
blindness
they
cast
away
the
precious
pearl
christ
and
hang
onto
their
stubborn
works
they
have
no
idea
what
faith
is
how
can
they
teach
faith
to
others
not
satisfied
with
teaching
an
untrue
gospel
the
false
apostles
tried
to
entangle
paul
they
went
about
says
paul
to
spy
out
our
liberty
which
we
have
in
christ
jesus
that
they
might
bring
us
into
bondage
when
paul
saw
through
their
scheme
he
attacked
the
false
apostles
he
says
we
did
not
let
go
of
the
liberty
which
we
have
in
christ
jesus
we
routed
them
by
the
judgment
of
the
apostles
and
we
would
not
give
in
to
them
no
not
an
inch
we
too
were
willing
to
make
all
kinds
of
concessions
to
the
papists
yes
we
are
willing
to
offer
them
more
than
we
should
but
we
will
not
give
up
the
liberty
of
conscience
which
we
have
in
christ
jesus
we
refuse
to
have
our
conscience
bound
by
any
work
or
law
so
that
by
doing
this
or
that
we
should
be
righteous
or
leaving
this
or
that
undone
we
should
be
damned
since
our
opponents
will
not
let
it
stand
that
only
faith
in
christ
justifies
we
will
not
yield
to
them
on
the
question
of
justification
we
must
remain
adamant
or
else
we
shall
lose
the
truth
of
the
gospel
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
it
involves
the
death
of
the
son
of
god
who
died
for
the
sins
of
the
world
if
we
surrender
faith
in
christ
as
the
only
thing
that
can
justify
us
the
death
and
resurrection
of
jesus
are
without
meaning
that
christ
is
the
savior
of
the
world
would
be
a
myth
god
would
be
a
liar
because
he
would
not
have
fulfilled
his
promises
our
stubbornness
is
right
because
we
want
to
preserve
the
liberty
which
we
have
in
christ
only
by
preserving
our
liberty
shall
we
be
able
to
retain
the
truth
of
the
gospel
inviolate
some
will
object
that
the
law
is
divine
and
holy
let
it
be
divine
and
holy
the
law
has
no
right
to
tell
me
that
i
must
be
justified
by
it
the
law
has
the
right
to
tell
me
that
i
should
love
god
and
my
neighbor
that
i
should
live
in
chastity
temperance
patience
etc
the
law
has
no
right
to
tell
me
how
i
may
be
delivered
from
sin
death
and
hell
it
is
the
gospel
business
to
tell
me
that
i
must
listen
to
the
gospel
it
tells
me
not
what
i
must
do
but
what
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
has
done
for
me
to
conclude
paul
refused
to
circumcise
titus
for
the
reason
that
the
false
apostles
wanted
to
compel
him
to
circumcise
titus
paul
refused
to
accede
to
their
demands
if
they
had
asked
it
on
the
plea
of
brotherly
love
paul
would
not
have
denied
them
but
because
they
demanded
it
on
the
ground
that
it
was
necessary
for
salvation
paul
defied
them
and
prevailed
titus
was
not
circumcised
verse
but
of
those
who
seemed
to
be
somewhat
whatsoever
they
were
it
maketh
no
matter
to
me
this
is
a
good
point
in
paul
refutation
paul
disparages
the
authority
and
dignity
of
the
true
apostles
he
says
of
them
which
seemed
to
be
somewhat
the
authority
of
the
apostles
was
indeed
great
in
all
the
churches
paul
did
not
want
to
detract
from
their
authority
but
he
had
to
speak
disparagingly
of
their
authority
in
order
to
conserve
the
truth
of
the
gospel
and
the
liberty
of
conscience
the
false
apostles
used
this
argument
against
paul
the
apostles
lived
with
christ
for
three
years
they
heard
his
sermons
they
witnessed
his
miracles
they
themselves
preached
and
performed
miracles
while
christ
was
on
earth
paul
never
saw
jesus
in
the
flesh
now
whom
ought
you
to
believe
paul
who
stands
alone
a
mere
disciple
of
the
apostles
one
of
the
last
and
least
or
will
you
believe
those
grand
apostles
who
were
sent
and
confirmed
by
christ
himself
long
before
paul
what
could
paul
say
to
that
he
answered
what
they
say
has
no
bearing
on
the
argument
if
the
apostles
were
angels
from
heaven
that
would
not
impress
me
we
are
not
now
discussing
the
excellency
of
the
apostles
we
are
talking
about
the
word
of
god
now
and
the
truth
of
the
gospel
that
gospel
is
more
excellent
than
all
apostles
verse
god
accepteth
no
man
person
paul
is
quoting
moses
thou
shalt
not
respect
the
person
of
the
poor
nor
honor
the
person
of
the
mighty
lev
this
quotation
from
moses
ought
to
shut
the
mouths
of
the
false
apostles
do
you
know
that
god
is
no
respecter
of
persons
cries
paul
the
dignity
or
authority
of
men
means
nothing
to
god
the
fact
is
that
god
often
rejects
just
such
who
stand
in
the
odor
of
sanctity
and
in
the
aura
of
importance
in
doing
so
god
seems
unjust
and
harsh
but
men
need
deterring
examples
for
it
is
a
vice
with
us
to
esteem
personality
more
highly
than
the
word
of
god
god
wants
us
to
exalt
his
word
and
not
men
there
must
be
people
in
high
office
of
course
but
we
are
not
to
deify
them
the
governor
the
mayor
the
preacher
the
teacher
the
scholar
father
mother
are
persons
whom
we
are
to
love
and
revere
but
not
to
the
extent
that
we
forget
god
least
we
attach
too
much
importance
to
the
person
god
leaves
with
important
persons
offenses
and
sins
sometimes
astounding
shortcomings
to
show
us
that
there
is
a
lot
of
difference
between
any
person
and
god
david
was
a
good
king
but
when
the
people
began
to
think
too
well
of
him
down
he
fell
into
horrible
sins
adultery
and
murder
peter
excellent
apostle
that
he
was
denied
christ
such
examples
of
which
the
scriptures
are
full
ought
to
warn
us
not
to
repose
our
trust
in
men
in
the
papacy
appearance
counts
for
everything
indeed
the
whole
papacy
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
a
mere
kowtowing
of
persons
and
outward
mummery
but
god
alone
is
to
be
feared
and
honored
i
would
honor
the
pope
i
would
love
his
person
if
he
would
leave
my
conscience
alone
and
not
compel
me
to
sin
against
god
but
the
pope
wants
to
be
adored
himself
and
that
can
not
be
done
without
offending
god
since
we
must
choose
between
one
or
the
other
let
us
choose
god
the
truth
is
we
are
commissioned
by
god
to
resist
the
pope
for
it
is
written
we
ought
to
obey
god
rather
than
men
acts
we
have
seen
how
paul
refutes
the
argument
of
the
false
apostles
concerning
the
authority
of
the
apostles
in
order
that
the
truth
of
the
gospel
may
continue
in
order
that
the
word
of
god
and
the
righteousness
of
faith
may
be
kept
pure
and
undefiled
let
the
apostles
let
an
angel
from
heaven
let
peter
let
paul
let
them
all
perish
verse
for
they
who
seemed
to
be
somewhat
in
conference
added
nothing
to
me
the
apostle
repeats
i
did
not
so
confer
with
the
apostles
that
they
taught
me
anything
what
could
they
possibly
teach
me
since
christ
by
his
revelation
had
taught
me
all
things
it
was
but
a
conference
and
no
disputation
i
learned
nothing
neither
did
i
defend
my
cause
i
only
stated
what
i
had
done
that
i
had
preached
to
the
gentiles
faith
in
christ
without
the
law
and
that
in
response
to
my
preaching
the
holy
ghost
came
down
upon
the
gentiles
when
the
apostles
heard
this
they
were
glad
that
i
had
taught
the
truth
if
paul
would
not
give
in
to
the
false
apostles
much
less
ought
we
to
give
in
to
our
opponents
i
know
that
a
christian
should
be
humble
but
against
the
pope
i
am
going
to
be
proud
and
say
to
him
you
pope
i
will
not
have
you
for
my
boss
for
i
am
sure
that
my
doctrine
is
divine
such
pride
against
the
pope
is
imperative
for
if
we
are
not
stout
and
proud
we
shall
never
succeed
in
defending
the
article
of
the
righteousness
of
faith
if
the
pope
would
concede
that
god
alone
by
his
grace
through
christ
justifies
sinners
we
would
carry
him
in
our
arms
we
would
kiss
his
feet
but
since
we
can
not
obtain
this
concession
we
will
give
in
to
nobody
not
to
all
the
angels
in
heaven
not
to
peter
not
to
paul
not
to
a
hundred
emperors
not
to
a
thousand
popes
not
to
the
whole
world
if
in
this
matter
we
were
to
humble
ourselves
they
would
take
from
us
the
god
who
created
us
and
jesus
christ
who
has
redeemed
us
by
his
blood
let
this
be
our
resolution
that
we
will
suffer
the
loss
of
all
things
the
loss
of
our
good
name
of
life
itself
but
the
gospel
and
our
faith
in
jesus
christ
we
will
not
stand
for
it
that
anybody
take
them
from
us
verses
but
contrariwise
when
they
saw
that
the
gospel
of
the
uncircumcision
was
committed
unto
me
as
the
gospel
of
the
circumcision
was
unto
peter
for
he
that
wrought
effectually
in
peter
to
the
apostleship
of
the
circumcision
the
same
was
mighty
in
me
toward
the
gentiles
here
the
apostle
claims
for
himself
the
same
authority
which
the
false
apostles
attributed
to
the
true
apostles
paul
simply
inverts
their
argument
to
bolster
their
evil
cause
says
he
the
false
apostles
quote
the
authority
of
the
great
apostles
against
me
i
can
quote
the
same
authority
against
them
for
the
apostles
are
on
my
side
they
gave
me
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
they
approved
my
ministry
o
my
galatians
do
not
believe
the
counterfeit
apostles
what
does
paul
mean
by
saying
that
the
gospel
of
the
uncircumcision
was
committed
unto
him
and
that
of
the
circumcision
to
peter
did
not
paul
preach
to
the
jews
while
peter
preached
to
the
gentiles
also
peter
converted
the
centurion
paul
custom
was
to
enter
into
the
synagogues
of
the
jews
there
to
preach
the
gospel
why
then
should
he
call
himself
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
while
he
calls
peter
the
apostle
of
the
circumcision
paul
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
other
apostles
remained
in
jerusalem
until
the
destruction
of
the
city
became
imminent
but
paul
was
especially
called
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
even
before
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
jews
dwelt
here
and
there
in
the
cities
of
the
gentiles
coming
to
a
city
paul
customarily
entered
the
synagogues
of
the
jews
and
first
brought
to
them
as
the
children
of
the
kingdom
the
glad
tidings
that
the
promises
made
unto
the
fathers
were
fulfilled
in
jesus
christ
when
the
jews
refused
to
hear
these
glad
tidings
paul
turned
to
the
gentiles
he
was
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
in
a
special
sense
as
peter
was
the
apostle
of
the
jews
paul
reiterates
that
peter
james
and
john
the
accepted
pillars
of
the
church
taught
him
nothing
nor
did
they
commit
unto
him
the
office
of
preaching
the
gospel
unto
the
gentiles
both
the
knowledge
of
the
gospel
and
the
commandment
to
preach
it
to
the
gentiles
paul
received
directly
from
god
his
case
was
parallel
to
that
of
peter
who
was
particularly
commissioned
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
jews
the
apostles
had
the
same
charge
the
identical
gospel
peter
did
not
proclaim
a
different
gospel
nor
had
he
appointed
his
fellow
apostles
they
were
equals
they
were
all
taught
of
god
none
was
greater
than
the
other
none
could
point
to
prerogatives
above
the
other
to
justify
his
usurped
primacy
in
the
church
the
pope
claims
that
peter
was
the
chief
of
the
apostles
this
is
an
impudent
falsehood
verse
for
he
that
wrought
effectually
in
peter
with
these
words
paul
refutes
another
argument
of
the
false
apostles
what
reason
have
the
false
apostles
to
boast
that
the
gospel
of
peter
was
mighty
that
he
converted
many
that
he
wrought
great
miracles
and
that
his
very
shadow
healed
the
sick
these
reports
are
true
enough
but
where
did
peter
acquire
this
power
god
gave
him
the
power
i
have
the
same
power
i
received
my
power
not
from
peter
but
from
the
same
god
the
same
spirit
who
was
mighty
in
peter
was
mighty
in
me
also
luke
corroborates
paul
statement
in
the
words
and
god
wrought
special
miracles
by
the
hands
of
paul
so
that
from
his
body
were
brought
unto
the
sick
handkerchiefs
or
aprons
and
the
diseases
departed
from
them
and
the
evil
spirits
went
out
of
them
acts
to
conclude
paul
is
not
going
to
be
inferior
to
the
rest
of
the
apostles
some
secular
writers
put
paul
boasting
down
as
carnal
pride
but
paul
had
no
personal
interest
in
his
boasting
it
was
with
him
a
matter
of
faith
and
doctrine
the
controversy
was
not
about
the
glory
of
paul
but
the
glory
of
god
the
word
of
god
the
true
worship
of
god
true
religion
and
the
righteousness
of
faith
verse
and
when
james
cephas
and
john
who
seemed
to
be
pillars
perceived
the
grace
that
was
given
unto
me
they
gave
to
me
and
barnabas
the
right
hands
of
fellowship
that
we
should
go
unto
the
heathen
and
they
unto
the
circumcision
the
fact
is
when
the
apostles
heard
that
i
had
received
the
charge
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
gentiles
from
christ
when
they
heard
that
god
had
wrought
many
miracles
through
me
that
great
numbers
of
the
gentiles
had
come
to
the
knowledge
of
christ
through
my
ministry
when
they
heard
that
the
gentiles
had
received
the
holy
ghost
without
law
and
circumcision
by
the
simple
preaching
of
faith
when
they
heard
all
this
they
glorified
god
for
his
grace
in
me
hence
paul
was
justified
in
concluding
that
the
apostles
were
for
him
and
not
against
him
verse
the
right
hands
of
fellowship
as
if
the
apostles
had
said
to
him
we
paul
do
agree
with
you
in
all
things
we
are
companions
in
doctrine
we
have
the
same
gospel
with
this
difference
that
to
you
is
committed
the
gospel
for
the
uncircumcised
while
the
gospel
for
the
circumcision
is
committed
unto
us
but
this
difference
ought
not
to
hinder
our
friendship
since
we
preach
one
and
the
same
gospel
verse
only
they
would
that
we
should
remember
the
poor
the
same
which
i
also
was
forward
to
do
next
to
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
a
true
and
faithful
pastor
will
take
care
of
the
poor
where
the
church
is
there
must
be
the
poor
for
the
world
and
the
devil
persecute
the
church
and
impoverish
many
faithful
christians
speaking
of
money
nobody
wants
to
contribute
nowadays
to
the
maintenance
of
the
ministry
and
the
erection
of
schools
when
it
comes
to
establishing
false
worship
and
idolatry
no
cost
is
spared
true
religion
is
ever
in
need
of
money
while
false
religions
are
backed
by
wealth
verse
but
when
peter
was
come
to
antioch
i
withstood
him
to
the
face
because
he
was
to
be
blamed
paul
goes
on
in
his
refutation
of
the
false
apostles
by
saying
that
in
antioch
he
withstood
peter
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
congregation
as
he
stated
before
paul
had
no
small
matter
in
hand
but
the
chief
article
of
the
christian
religion
when
this
article
is
endangered
we
must
not
hesitate
to
resist
peter
or
an
angel
from
heaven
paul
paid
no
regard
to
the
dignity
and
position
of
peter
when
he
saw
this
article
in
danger
it
is
written
he
that
loveth
father
or
mother
or
his
own
life
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
matt
for
defending
the
truth
in
our
day
we
are
called
proud
and
obstinate
hypocrites
we
are
not
ashamed
of
these
titles
the
cause
we
are
called
to
defend
is
not
peter
cause
or
the
cause
of
our
parents
or
that
of
the
government
or
that
of
the
world
but
the
cause
of
god
in
defense
of
that
cause
we
must
be
firm
and
unyielding
when
he
says
to
his
face
paul
accuses
the
false
apostles
of
slandering
him
behind
his
back
in
his
presence
they
dared
not
to
open
their
mouths
he
tells
them
i
did
not
speak
evil
of
peter
behind
his
back
but
i
withstood
him
frankly
and
openly
others
may
debate
here
whether
an
apostle
might
sin
i
claim
that
we
ought
not
to
make
peter
out
as
faultless
prophets
have
erred
nathan
told
david
that
he
should
go
ahead
and
build
the
temple
of
the
lord
but
his
prophecy
was
afterwards
corrected
by
the
lord
the
apostles
erred
in
thinking
of
the
kingdom
of
christ
as
a
worldly
state
peter
had
heard
the
command
of
christ
go
ye
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
but
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
heavenly
vision
and
the
special
command
of
christ
peter
would
never
have
gone
to
the
home
of
cornelius
peter
also
erred
in
this
matter
of
circumcision
if
paul
had
not
publicly
censured
him
all
the
believing
gentiles
would
have
been
compelled
to
receive
circumcision
and
accept
the
jewish
law
we
are
not
to
attribute
perfection
to
any
man
luke
reports
that
the
contention
between
paul
and
barnabas
was
so
sharp
that
they
departed
asunder
one
from
the
other
the
cause
of
their
disagreement
could
hardly
have
been
small
since
it
separated
these
two
who
had
been
joined
together
for
years
in
a
holy
partnership
such
incidents
are
recorded
for
our
consolation
after
all
it
is
a
comfort
to
know
that
even
saints
might
and
do
sin
samson
david
and
many
other
excellent
men
fell
into
grievous
sins
job
and
jeremiah
cursed
the
day
of
their
birth
elijah
and
jonah
became
weary
of
life
and
prayed
for
death
such
offenses
on
the
part
of
the
saints
the
scriptures
record
for
the
comfort
of
those
who
are
near
despair
no
person
has
ever
sunk
so
low
that
he
can
not
rise
again
on
the
other
hand
no
man
standing
is
so
secure
that
he
may
not
fall
if
peter
fell
i
may
fall
if
he
rose
again
i
may
rise
again
we
have
the
same
gifts
that
they
had
the
same
christ
the
same
baptism
and
the
same
gospel
the
same
forgiveness
of
sins
they
needed
these
saving
ordinances
just
as
much
as
we
do
verse
for
before
that
certain
came
from
james
he
did
eat
with
the
gentiles
the
gentiles
who
had
been
converted
to
faith
in
christ
ate
meats
forbidden
by
the
law
peter
visiting
some
of
these
gentiles
ate
meat
and
drank
wine
with
them
although
he
knew
that
these
things
were
forbidden
in
the
law
paul
declared
that
he
did
likewise
that
he
became
as
a
jew
to
the
jews
and
to
them
that
were
without
law
as
without
law
he
ate
and
drank
with
the
gentiles
unconcerned
about
the
jewish
law
when
he
was
with
the
jews
however
he
abstained
from
all
things
forbidden
in
the
law
for
he
labored
to
serve
all
men
that
he
might
by
all
means
save
some
paul
does
not
reprove
peter
for
transgressing
the
law
but
for
disguising
his
attitude
to
the
law
verse
but
when
they
were
come
he
withdrew
and
separated
himself
fearing
them
which
were
of
the
circumcision
paul
does
not
accuse
peter
of
malice
or
ignorance
but
of
lack
of
principle
in
that
he
abstained
from
meats
because
he
feared
the
jews
that
came
from
james
peter
weak
attitude
endangered
the
principle
of
christian
liberty
it
is
the
deduction
rather
than
the
fact
which
paul
reproves
to
eat
and
to
drink
or
not
to
eat
and
drink
is
immaterial
but
to
make
the
deduction
if
you
eat
you
sin
if
you
abstain
you
are
righteous
this
is
wrong
meats
may
be
refused
for
two
reasons
first
they
may
be
refused
for
the
sake
of
christian
love
there
is
no
danger
connected
with
a
refusal
of
meats
for
the
sake
of
charity
to
bear
with
the
infirmity
of
a
brother
is
a
good
thing
paul
himself
taught
and
exemplified
such
thoughtfulness
secondly
meats
may
be
refused
in
the
mistaken
hope
of
thereby
obtaining
righteousness
when
this
is
the
purpose
of
abstaining
from
meats
we
say
let
charity
go
to
refrain
from
meats
for
this
latter
reason
amounts
to
a
denial
of
christ
if
we
must
lose
one
or
the
other
let
us
lose
a
friend
and
brother
rather
than
god
our
father
jerome
who
understood
not
this
passage
nor
the
whole
epistle
for
that
matter
excuses
peter
action
on
the
ground
that
it
was
done
in
ignorance
but
peter
offended
by
giving
the
impression
that
he
was
indorsing
the
law
by
his
example
he
encouraged
gentiles
and
jews
to
forsake
the
truth
of
the
gospel
if
paul
had
not
reproved
him
there
would
have
been
a
sliding
back
of
christians
into
the
jewish
religion
and
a
return
to
the
burdens
of
the
law
it
is
surprising
that
peter
excellent
apostle
that
he
was
should
have
been
guilty
of
such
vacillation
in
a
former
council
at
jerusalem
he
practically
stood
alone
in
defense
of
the
truth
that
salvation
is
by
faith
without
the
law
peter
at
that
time
valiantly
defended
the
liberty
of
the
gospel
but
now
by
abstaining
from
meats
forbidden
in
the
law
he
went
against
his
better
judgment
you
have
no
idea
what
danger
there
is
in
customs
and
ceremonies
they
so
easily
tend
to
error
in
works
verse
and
the
other
jews
dissembled
likewise
with
him
insomuch
that
barnabas
also
was
carried
away
with
their
dissimulation
it
is
marvelous
how
god
preserved
the
church
by
one
single
person
paul
alone
stood
up
for
the
truth
for
barnabas
his
companion
was
lost
to
him
and
peter
was
against
him
sometimes
one
lone
person
can
do
more
in
a
conference
than
the
whole
assembly
i
mention
this
to
urge
all
to
learn
how
properly
to
differentiate
between
the
law
and
the
gospel
in
order
to
avoid
dissembling
when
it
come
to
the
article
of
justification
we
must
not
yield
if
we
want
to
retain
the
truth
of
the
gospel
when
the
conscience
is
disturbed
do
not
seek
advice
from
reason
or
from
the
law
but
rest
your
conscience
in
the
grace
of
god
and
in
his
word
and
proceed
as
if
you
had
never
heard
of
the
law
the
law
has
its
place
and
its
own
good
time
while
moses
was
in
the
mountain
where
he
talked
with
god
face
to
face
he
had
no
law
he
made
no
law
he
administered
no
law
but
when
he
came
down
from
the
mountain
he
was
a
lawgiver
the
conscience
must
be
kept
above
the
law
the
body
under
the
law
paul
reproved
peter
for
no
trifle
but
for
the
chief
article
of
christian
doctrine
which
peter
hypocrisy
had
endangered
for
barnabas
and
other
jews
followed
peter
example
it
is
surprising
that
such
good
men
as
peter
barnabas
and
others
should
fall
into
unexpected
error
especially
in
a
matter
which
they
knew
so
well
to
trust
in
our
own
strength
our
own
goodness
our
own
wisdom
is
a
perilous
thing
let
us
search
the
scriptures
with
humility
praying
that
we
may
never
lose
the
light
of
the
gospel
lord
increase
our
faith
verse
but
when
i
saw
that
they
walked
not
uprightly
according
to
the
truth
of
the
gospel
no
one
except
paul
had
his
eyes
open
consequently
it
was
his
duty
to
reprove
peter
and
his
followers
for
swerving
from
the
truth
of
the
gospel
it
was
no
easy
task
for
paul
to
reprimand
peter
to
the
honor
of
peter
it
must
be
said
that
he
took
the
correction
no
doubt
he
freely
acknowledged
his
fault
the
person
who
can
rightly
divide
law
and
gospel
has
reason
to
thank
god
he
is
a
true
theologian
i
must
confess
that
in
times
of
temptation
i
do
not
always
know
how
to
do
it
to
divide
law
and
gospel
means
to
place
the
gospel
in
heaven
and
to
keep
the
law
on
earth
to
call
the
righteousness
of
the
gospel
heavenly
and
the
righteousness
of
the
law
earthly
to
put
as
much
difference
between
the
righteousness
of
the
gospel
and
that
of
the
law
as
there
is
difference
between
day
and
night
if
it
is
a
question
of
faith
or
conscience
ignore
the
law
entirely
if
it
is
a
question
of
works
then
lift
high
the
lantern
of
works
and
the
righteousness
of
the
law
if
your
conscience
is
oppressed
with
a
sense
of
sin
talk
to
your
conscience
say
you
are
now
groveling
in
the
dirt
you
are
now
a
laboring
ass
go
ahead
and
carry
your
burden
but
why
do
you
mount
up
to
heaven
there
the
law
can
not
follow
you
leave
the
ass
burdened
with
laws
behind
in
the
valley
but
your
conscience
let
it
ascend
with
isaac
into
the
mountain
in
civil
life
obedience
to
the
law
is
severely
required
in
civil
life
gospel
conscience
grace
remission
of
sins
christ
himself
do
not
count
but
only
moses
with
the
lawbooks
if
we
bear
in
mind
this
distinction
neither
gospel
nor
law
shall
trespass
upon
each
other
the
moment
law
and
sin
cross
into
heaven
your
conscience
kick
them
out
on
the
other
hand
when
grace
wanders
unto
the
earth
into
the
body
tell
grace
you
have
no
business
to
be
around
the
dreg
and
dung
of
this
bodily
life
you
belong
in
heaven
by
his
compromising
attitude
peter
confused
the
separation
of
law
and
gospel
paul
had
to
do
something
about
it
he
reproved
peter
not
to
embarrass
him
but
to
conserve
the
difference
between
the
gospel
which
justifies
in
heaven
and
the
law
which
justifies
on
earth
the
right
separation
between
law
and
gospel
is
very
important
to
know
christian
doctrine
is
impossible
without
it
let
all
who
love
and
fear
god
diligently
learn
the
difference
not
only
in
theory
but
also
in
practice
when
your
conscience
gets
into
trouble
say
to
yourself
there
is
a
time
to
die
and
a
time
to
live
a
time
to
learn
the
law
and
a
time
to
unlearn
the
law
a
time
to
hear
the
gospel
and
a
time
to
ignore
the
gospel
let
the
law
now
depart
and
let
the
gospel
enter
for
now
is
the
right
time
to
hear
the
gospel
and
not
the
law
however
when
the
conflict
of
conscience
is
over
and
external
duties
must
be
performed
close
your
ears
to
the
gospel
and
open
them
wide
to
the
law
verse
i
said
unto
peter
before
them
all
if
thou
being
a
jew
livest
after
the
manner
of
gentiles
and
not
as
do
the
jews
why
compellest
thou
the
gentiles
to
live
as
do
the
jews
to
live
as
a
jew
is
nothing
bad
to
eat
or
not
to
eat
pork
what
difference
does
it
make
but
to
play
the
jew
and
for
conscience
sake
to
abstain
from
certain
meats
is
a
denial
of
christ
when
paul
saw
that
peter
attitude
tended
to
this
he
withstood
peter
and
said
to
him
you
know
that
the
observance
of
the
law
is
not
needed
unto
righteousness
you
know
that
we
are
justified
by
faith
in
christ
you
know
that
we
may
eat
all
kinds
of
meats
yet
by
your
example
you
obligate
the
gentiles
to
forsake
christ
and
to
return
to
the
law
you
give
them
reason
to
think
that
faith
is
not
sufficient
unto
salvation
peter
did
not
say
so
but
his
example
said
quite
plainly
that
the
observance
of
the
law
must
be
added
to
faith
in
christ
if
men
are
to
be
saved
from
peter
example
the
gentiles
could
not
help
but
draw
the
conclusion
that
the
law
was
necessary
unto
salvation
if
this
error
had
been
permitted
to
pass
unchallenged
christ
would
have
lost
out
altogether
the
controversy
involved
the
preservation
of
pure
doctrine
in
such
a
controversy
paul
did
not
mind
if
anybody
took
offense
verse
we
who
are
jews
by
nature
and
not
sinners
of
the
gentiles
when
we
jews
compare
ourselves
with
the
gentiles
we
look
pretty
good
we
have
the
law
we
have
good
works
our
rectitude
dates
from
our
birth
because
the
jewish
religion
is
natural
to
us
but
all
this
does
not
make
us
righteous
before
god
peter
and
the
others
lived
up
to
the
requirements
of
the
law
they
had
circumcision
the
covenant
the
promises
the
apostleship
but
because
of
these
advantages
they
were
not
to
think
themselves
righteous
before
god
none
of
these
prerogatives
spell
faith
in
christ
which
alone
can
justify
a
person
we
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
the
law
is
bad
we
do
not
condemn
the
law
circumcision
for
their
failure
to
justify
us
paul
spoke
disparagingly
of
these
ordinances
because
the
false
apostles
asserted
that
mankind
is
saved
by
them
without
faith
paul
could
not
let
this
assertion
stand
for
without
faith
all
things
are
deadly
verse
knowing
that
a
man
is
not
justified
by
the
works
of
the
law
but
by
the
faith
of
jesus
christ
for
the
sake
of
argument
let
us
suppose
that
you
could
fulfill
the
law
in
the
spirit
of
the
first
commandment
of
god
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thy
heart
it
would
do
you
no
good
a
person
simply
is
not
justified
by
the
works
of
the
law
the
works
of
the
law
according
to
paul
include
the
whole
law
judicial
ceremonial
moral
now
if
the
performance
of
the
moral
law
can
not
justify
how
can
circumcision
justify
when
circumcision
is
part
of
the
ceremonial
law
the
demands
of
the
law
may
be
fulfilled
before
and
after
justification
there
were
many
excellent
men
among
the
pagans
of
old
men
who
never
heard
of
justification
they
lived
moral
lives
but
that
fact
did
not
justify
them
peter
paul
all
christians
live
up
to
the
law
but
that
fact
does
not
justify
them
for
i
know
nothing
by
myself
says
paul
yet
am
i
not
hereby
justified
i
cor
the
nefarious
opinion
of
the
papists
which
attributes
the
merit
of
grace
and
the
remission
of
sins
to
works
must
here
be
emphatically
rejected
the
papists
say
that
a
good
work
performed
before
grace
has
been
obtained
is
able
to
secure
grace
for
a
person
because
it
is
no
more
than
right
that
god
should
reward
a
good
deed
when
grace
has
already
been
obtained
any
good
work
deserves
everlasting
life
as
a
due
payment
and
reward
for
merit
for
the
first
god
is
no
debtor
they
say
but
because
god
is
good
and
just
it
is
no
more
than
right
they
say
that
he
should
reward
a
good
work
by
granting
grace
for
the
service
but
when
grace
has
already
been
obtained
they
continue
god
is
in
the
position
of
a
debtor
and
is
in
duty
bound
to
reward
a
good
work
with
the
gift
of
eternal
life
this
is
the
wicked
teaching
of
the
papacy
now
if
i
could
perform
any
work
acceptable
to
god
and
deserving
of
grace
and
once
having
obtained
grace
my
good
works
would
continue
to
earn
for
me
the
right
and
reward
of
eternal
life
why
should
i
stand
in
need
of
the
grace
of
god
and
the
suffering
and
death
of
christ
christ
would
be
of
no
benefit
to
me
christ
mercy
would
be
of
no
use
to
me
this
shows
how
little
insight
the
pope
and
the
whole
of
his
religious
coterie
have
into
spiritual
matters
and
how
little
they
concern
themselves
with
the
spiritual
health
of
their
forlorn
flocks
they
can
not
believe
that
the
flesh
is
unable
to
think
speak
or
do
anything
except
against
god
if
they
could
see
evil
rooted
in
the
nature
of
man
they
would
never
entertain
such
silly
dreams
about
man
merit
or
worthiness
with
paul
we
absolutely
deny
the
possibility
of
self
merit
god
never
yet
gave
to
any
person
grace
and
everlasting
life
as
a
reward
for
merit
the
opinions
of
the
papists
are
the
intellectual
of
idle
pates
that
serve
no
other
purpose
but
to
draw
men
away
from
the
true
worship
of
god
the
papacy
is
founded
upon
hallucinations
the
true
way
of
salvation
is
this
first
a
person
must
realize
that
he
is
a
sinner
the
kind
of
a
sinner
who
is
congenitally
unable
to
do
any
good
thing
whatsoever
is
not
of
faith
is
sin
those
who
seek
to
earn
the
grace
of
god
by
their
own
efforts
are
trying
to
please
god
with
sins
they
mock
god
and
provoke
his
anger
the
first
step
on
the
way
to
salvation
is
to
repent
the
second
part
is
this
god
sent
his
son
into
the
world
that
we
may
live
through
his
merit
he
was
crucified
and
killed
for
us
by
sacrificing
his
son
for
us
god
revealed
himself
to
us
as
a
merciful
father
who
donates
remission
of
sins
righteousness
and
life
everlasting
for
christ
sake
god
hands
out
his
gifts
freely
unto
all
men
that
is
the
praise
and
glory
of
his
mercy
the
scholastics
explain
the
way
of
salvation
in
this
manner
when
a
person
happens
to
perform
a
good
deed
god
accepts
it
and
as
a
reward
for
the
good
deed
god
pours
charity
into
that
person
they
call
it
charity
infused
this
charity
is
supposed
to
remain
in
the
heart
they
get
wild
when
they
are
told
that
this
quality
of
the
heart
can
not
justify
a
person
they
also
claim
that
we
are
able
to
love
god
by
our
own
natural
strength
to
love
god
above
all
things
at
least
to
the
extent
that
we
deserve
grace
and
say
the
scholastics
because
god
is
not
satisfied
with
a
literal
performance
of
the
law
but
expects
us
to
fulfill
the
law
according
to
the
mind
of
the
lawgiver
therefore
we
must
obtain
from
above
a
quality
above
nature
a
quality
which
they
call
formal
righteousness
we
say
faith
apprehends
jesus
christ
christian
faith
is
not
an
inactive
quality
in
the
heart
if
it
is
true
faith
it
will
surely
take
christ
for
its
object
christ
apprehended
by
faith
and
dwelling
in
the
heart
constitutes
christian
righteousness
for
which
god
gives
eternal
life
in
contrast
to
the
doting
dreams
of
the
scholastics
we
teach
this
first
a
person
must
learn
to
know
himself
from
the
law
with
the
prophet
he
will
then
confess
all
have
sinned
and
come
short
of
the
glory
of
god
and
there
is
none
that
doeth
good
no
not
one
and
against
thee
thee
only
have
i
sinned
having
been
humbled
by
the
law
and
having
been
brought
to
a
right
estimate
of
himself
a
man
will
repent
he
finds
out
that
he
is
so
depraved
that
no
strength
no
works
no
merits
of
his
own
will
ever
deliver
him
from
his
guilt
he
will
then
understand
the
meaning
of
paul
words
i
am
sold
under
sin
and
they
are
all
under
sin
at
this
state
a
person
begins
to
lament
who
is
going
to
help
me
in
due
time
comes
the
word
of
the
gospel
and
says
son
thy
sins
are
forgiven
thee
believe
in
jesus
christ
who
was
crucified
for
your
sins
remember
your
sins
have
been
imposed
upon
christ
in
this
way
are
we
delivered
from
sin
in
this
way
are
we
justified
and
made
heirs
of
everlasting
life
in
order
to
have
faith
you
must
paint
a
true
portrait
of
christ
the
scholastics
caricature
christ
into
a
judge
and
tormentor
but
christ
is
no
law
giver
he
is
the
lifegiver
he
is
the
forgiver
of
sins
you
must
believe
that
christ
might
have
atoned
for
the
sins
of
the
world
with
one
single
drop
of
his
blood
instead
he
shed
his
blood
abundantly
in
order
that
he
might
give
abundant
satisfaction
for
our
sins
here
let
me
say
that
these
three
things
faith
christ
and
imputation
of
righteousness
are
to
be
joined
together
faith
takes
hold
of
christ
god
accounts
this
faith
for
righteousness
this
imputation
of
righteousness
we
need
very
much
because
we
are
far
from
perfect
as
long
as
we
have
this
body
sin
will
dwell
in
our
flesh
then
too
we
sometimes
drive
away
the
holy
spirit
we
fall
into
sin
like
peter
david
and
other
holy
men
nevertheless
we
may
always
take
recourse
to
this
fact
that
our
sins
are
covered
and
that
god
will
not
lay
them
to
our
charge
sin
is
not
held
against
us
for
sake
where
christ
and
faith
are
lacking
there
is
no
remission
or
covering
of
sins
but
only
condemnation
after
we
have
taught
faith
in
christ
we
teach
good
works
since
you
have
found
christ
by
faith
we
say
begin
now
to
work
and
do
well
love
god
and
your
neighbor
call
upon
god
give
thanks
unto
him
praise
him
confess
him
these
are
good
works
let
them
flow
from
a
cheerful
heart
because
you
have
remission
of
sin
in
christ
when
crosses
and
afflictions
come
our
way
we
bear
them
patiently
for
christ
yoke
is
easy
and
his
burden
is
light
when
sin
has
been
pardoned
and
the
conscience
has
been
eased
of
its
dreadful
load
a
christian
can
endure
all
things
in
christ
to
give
a
short
definition
of
a
christian
a
christian
is
not
somebody
who
chalks
sp
sin
because
of
his
faith
in
christ
this
doctrine
brings
comfort
to
consciences
in
serious
trouble
when
a
person
is
a
christian
he
is
above
law
and
sin
when
the
law
accuses
him
and
sin
wants
to
drive
the
wits
out
of
him
a
christian
looks
to
christ
a
christian
is
free
he
has
no
master
except
christ
a
christian
is
greater
than
the
whole
world
verse
even
we
have
believed
in
jesus
christ
that
we
might
be
justified
the
true
way
of
becoming
a
christian
is
to
be
justified
by
faith
in
jesus
christ
and
not
by
the
works
of
the
law
we
know
that
we
must
also
teach
good
works
but
they
must
be
taught
in
their
proper
turn
when
the
discussion
is
concerning
works
and
not
the
article
of
justification
here
the
question
arises
by
what
means
are
we
justified
we
answer
with
paul
by
faith
only
in
christ
are
we
pronounced
righteous
and
not
by
works
not
that
we
reject
good
works
far
from
it
but
we
will
not
allow
ourselves
to
be
removed
from
the
anchorage
of
our
salvation
the
law
is
a
good
thing
but
when
the
discussion
is
about
justification
then
is
no
time
to
drag
in
the
law
when
we
discuss
justification
we
ought
to
speak
of
christ
and
the
benefits
he
has
brought
us
christ
is
no
sheriff
he
is
the
lamb
of
god
which
taketh
away
the
sin
of
the
world
john
verse
that
we
might
be
justified
by
the
faith
of
christ
and
not
by
the
works
of
the
law
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
law
is
bad
only
it
is
not
able
to
justify
us
to
be
at
peace
with
god
we
have
need
of
a
far
better
mediator
than
moses
or
the
law
we
must
know
that
we
are
nothing
we
must
understand
that
we
are
merely
beneficiaries
and
recipients
of
the
treasures
of
christ
so
far
the
words
of
paul
were
addressed
to
peter
now
paul
turns
to
the
galatians
and
makes
this
summary
statement
verse
for
by
the
works
of
the
law
shall
no
flesh
be
justified
by
the
term
flesh
paul
does
not
understand
manifest
vices
such
sins
he
usually
calls
by
their
proper
names
as
adultery
fornication
etc
by
flesh
paul
understands
what
jesus
meant
in
the
third
chapter
of
john
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
john
flesh
here
means
the
whole
nature
of
man
inclusive
of
reason
and
instincts
this
flesh
says
paul
is
not
justified
by
the
works
of
the
law
the
papists
do
not
believe
this
they
say
a
person
who
performs
this
good
deed
or
that
deserves
the
forgiveness
of
his
sins
a
person
who
joins
this
or
that
holy
order
has
the
promise
of
everlasting
life
to
me
it
is
a
miracle
that
the
church
so
long
surrounded
by
vicious
sects
has
been
able
to
survive
at
all
god
must
have
been
able
to
call
a
few
who
in
their
failure
to
discover
any
good
in
themselves
to
cite
against
the
wrath
and
judgment
of
god
simply
took
to
the
suffering
and
death
of
christ
and
were
saved
by
this
simple
faith
nevertheless
god
has
punished
the
contempt
of
the
gospel
and
of
christ
on
the
part
of
the
papists
by
turning
them
over
to
a
reprobate
state
of
mind
in
which
they
reject
the
gospel
and
receive
with
gusto
the
abominable
rules
ordinances
and
traditions
of
men
in
preference
to
the
word
of
god
until
they
went
so
far
as
to
forbid
marriage
god
punished
them
justly
because
they
blasphemed
the
only
son
of
god
this
is
then
our
general
conclusion
by
the
works
of
the
law
shall
no
flesh
be
justified
verse
but
if
while
we
seek
to
be
justified
by
christ
we
ourselves
also
are
found
sinners
is
therefore
christ
the
minister
of
sin
god
forbid
either
we
are
not
justified
by
christ
or
we
are
not
justified
by
the
law
the
fact
is
we
are
justified
by
christ
hence
we
are
not
justified
by
the
law
if
we
observe
the
law
in
order
to
be
justified
or
after
having
been
justified
by
christ
we
think
we
must
further
be
justified
by
the
law
we
convert
christ
into
a
legislator
and
a
minister
of
sin
what
are
these
false
apostles
doing
paul
cries
they
are
turning
law
into
grace
and
grace
into
law
they
are
changing
moses
into
christ
and
christ
into
moses
by
teaching
that
besides
christ
and
his
righteousness
the
performance
of
the
law
is
necessary
unto
salvation
they
put
the
law
in
the
place
of
christ
they
attribute
to
the
law
the
power
to
save
a
power
that
belongs
to
christ
only
the
papists
quote
the
words
of
christ
if
thou
wilt
enter
into
life
keep
the
commandments
matt
with
his
own
words
they
deny
christ
and
abolish
faith
in
him
christ
is
made
to
lose
his
good
name
his
office
and
his
glory
and
is
demoted
to
the
status
of
a
law
enforcer
reproving
terrifying
and
chasing
poor
sinners
around
the
proper
office
of
christ
is
to
raise
the
sinner
and
extricate
him
from
his
sins
papists
and
anabaptists
deride
us
because
we
so
earnestly
require
faith
faith
they
say
makes
men
reckless
what
do
these
know
about
faith
when
they
are
so
busy
calling
people
back
from
baptism
from
faith
from
the
promises
of
christ
to
the
law
with
their
doctrine
these
lying
sects
of
perdition
deface
the
benefits
of
christ
to
this
day
they
rob
christ
of
his
glory
as
the
justifier
of
mankind
and
cast
him
into
the
role
of
a
minister
of
sin
they
are
like
the
false
apostles
there
is
not
a
single
one
among
them
who
knows
the
difference
between
law
and
grace
we
can
tell
the
difference
we
do
not
here
and
now
argue
whether
we
ought
to
do
good
works
or
whether
the
law
is
any
good
or
whether
the
law
ought
to
be
kept
at
all
we
will
discuss
these
questions
some
other
time
we
are
now
concerned
with
justification
our
opponents
refuse
to
make
this
distinction
all
they
can
do
is
to
bellow
that
good
works
ought
to
be
done
we
know
that
we
know
that
good
works
ought
to
be
done
but
we
will
talk
about
that
when
the
proper
time
comes
now
we
are
dealing
with
justification
and
here
good
works
should
not
be
so
much
as
mentioned
paul
argument
has
often
comforted
me
he
argues
if
we
who
have
been
justified
by
christ
are
counted
unrighteous
why
seek
justification
in
christ
at
all
if
we
are
justified
by
the
law
tell
me
what
has
christ
achieved
by
his
death
by
his
preaching
by
his
victory
over
sin
and
death
either
we
are
justified
by
christ
or
we
are
made
worse
sinners
by
him
the
sacred
scriptures
particularly
those
of
the
new
testament
make
frequent
mention
of
faith
in
christ
whosoever
believeth
in
him
is
saved
shall
not
perish
shall
have
everlasting
life
is
not
judged
etc
in
open
contradiction
to
the
scriptures
our
opponents
misquote
he
that
believeth
in
christ
is
condemned
because
he
has
faith
without
works
our
opponents
turn
everything
they
make
christ
over
into
a
murderer
and
moses
into
a
savior
is
not
this
horrible
blasphemy
verse
is
therefore
christ
the
minister
of
sin
this
is
hebrew
phraseology
also
used
by
paul
in
ii
corinthians
chapter
there
paul
speaks
of
two
ministers
the
minister
of
the
letter
and
the
minister
of
the
spirit
the
minister
of
the
law
and
the
minister
of
grace
the
minister
of
death
and
the
minister
of
life
moses
says
paul
is
the
minister
of
the
law
of
sin
wrath
death
and
condemnation
whoever
teaches
that
good
works
are
indispensable
unto
salvation
that
to
gain
heaven
a
person
must
suffer
afflictions
and
follow
the
example
of
christ
and
of
the
saints
is
a
minister
of
the
law
of
sin
wrath
and
of
death
for
the
conscience
knows
how
impossible
it
is
for
a
person
to
fulfill
the
law
why
the
law
makes
trouble
even
for
those
who
have
the
holy
spirit
what
will
not
the
law
do
in
the
case
of
the
wicked
who
do
not
even
have
the
holy
spirit
the
law
requires
perfect
obedience
it
condemns
all
who
do
not
accomplish
the
will
of
god
but
show
me
a
person
who
is
able
to
render
perfect
obedience
the
law
can
not
justify
it
can
only
condemn
according
to
the
passage
cursed
is
every
one
that
continueth
not
in
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
to
do
them
paul
has
good
reason
for
calling
the
minister
of
the
law
the
minister
of
sin
for
the
law
reveals
our
sinfulness
the
realization
of
sin
in
turn
frightens
the
heart
and
drives
it
to
despair
therefore
all
exponents
of
the
law
and
of
works
deserve
to
be
called
tyrants
and
oppressors
the
purpose
of
the
law
is
to
reveal
sin
that
this
is
the
purpose
of
the
law
can
be
seen
from
the
account
of
the
giving
of
the
law
as
reported
in
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
chapters
of
exodus
moses
brought
the
people
out
of
their
tents
to
have
god
speak
to
them
personally
from
a
cloud
but
the
people
trembled
with
fear
fled
and
standing
aloof
they
begged
moses
speak
thou
with
us
and
we
will
hear
but
let
not
god
speak
with
us
lest
we
die
the
proper
office
of
the
law
is
to
lead
us
out
of
our
tents
in
other
words
out
of
the
security
of
our
into
the
presence
of
god
that
we
may
perceive
his
anger
at
our
sinfulness
all
who
say
that
faith
alone
in
christ
does
not
justify
a
person
convert
christ
into
a
minister
of
sin
a
teacher
of
the
law
and
a
cruel
tyrant
who
requires
the
impossible
all
take
christ
for
a
new
lawgiver
in
conclusion
if
the
law
is
the
minister
of
sin
it
is
at
the
same
time
the
minister
of
wrath
and
death
as
the
law
reveals
sin
it
fills
a
person
with
the
fear
of
death
and
condemnation
eventually
the
conscience
wakes
up
to
the
fact
that
god
is
angry
if
god
is
angry
with
you
he
will
destroy
and
condemn
you
forever
unable
to
stand
the
thought
of
the
wrath
and
judgment
of
god
many
a
person
commits
suicide
verse
god
forbid
christ
is
not
the
minister
of
sin
but
the
dispenser
of
righteousness
and
the
giver
of
life
christ
is
lord
over
law
sin
and
death
all
who
believe
in
him
are
delivered
from
law
sin
and
death
the
law
drives
us
away
from
god
but
christ
reconciles
god
unto
us
for
he
is
the
lamb
of
god
that
taketh
away
the
sins
of
the
world
now
if
the
sin
of
the
world
is
taken
away
it
is
taken
away
from
me
if
sin
is
taken
away
the
wrath
of
god
and
his
condemnation
are
also
taken
away
let
us
practice
this
blessed
conviction
verse
for
if
i
build
again
the
things
which
i
destroyed
i
make
myself
a
transgressor
i
have
not
preached
to
the
end
that
i
build
again
the
things
which
i
destroyed
if
i
should
do
so
i
would
not
only
be
laboring
in
vain
but
i
would
make
myself
guilty
of
a
great
wrong
by
the
ministry
of
the
gospel
i
have
destroyed
sin
heaviness
of
heart
wrath
and
death
i
have
abolished
the
law
so
that
it
should
not
bother
your
conscience
any
more
should
i
now
once
again
establish
the
law
and
set
up
the
rule
of
moses
this
is
exactly
what
i
should
be
doing
if
i
would
urge
circumcision
and
the
performance
of
the
law
as
necessary
unto
salvation
instead
of
righteousness
and
life
i
would
restore
sin
and
death
by
the
grace
of
god
we
know
that
we
are
justified
through
faith
in
christ
alone
we
do
not
mingle
law
and
grace
faith
and
works
we
keep
them
far
apart
let
every
true
christian
mark
the
distinction
between
law
and
grace
and
mark
it
well
we
must
not
drag
good
works
into
the
article
of
justification
as
the
monks
do
who
maintain
that
not
only
good
works
but
also
the
punishment
which
evildoers
suffer
for
their
wicked
deeds
deserve
everlasting
life
when
a
criminal
is
brought
to
the
place
of
execution
the
monks
try
to
comfort
him
in
this
manner
you
want
to
die
willingly
and
patiently
and
then
you
will
merit
remission
of
your
sins
and
eternal
life
what
cruelty
is
this
that
a
wretched
thief
murderer
robber
should
be
so
miserably
misguided
in
his
extreme
distress
that
at
the
very
point
of
death
he
should
be
denied
the
sweet
promises
of
christ
and
directed
to
hope
for
pardon
of
his
sins
in
the
willingness
and
patience
with
which
he
is
about
to
suffer
death
for
his
crimes
the
monks
are
showing
him
the
paved
way
to
hell
these
hypocrites
do
not
know
the
first
thing
about
grace
the
gospel
or
christ
they
retain
the
appearance
and
the
name
of
the
gospel
and
of
christ
for
a
decoy
only
in
their
confessional
writings
faith
or
the
merit
of
christ
are
never
mentioned
in
their
writings
they
play
up
the
merits
of
man
as
can
readily
be
seen
from
the
following
form
of
absolution
used
among
the
monks
god
forgive
thee
brother
the
merit
of
the
passion
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
of
the
blessed
saint
mary
always
a
virgin
and
of
all
the
saints
the
merit
of
thy
order
the
strictness
of
thy
religion
the
humility
of
thy
profession
the
contrition
of
thy
heart
the
good
works
thou
hast
done
and
shalt
do
for
the
love
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
be
available
unto
thee
for
the
remission
of
thy
sins
the
increase
of
thy
worth
and
grace
and
the
reward
of
everlasting
life
amen
true
the
merit
of
christ
is
mentioned
in
this
formula
of
absolution
but
if
you
look
closer
you
will
notice
that
christ
merit
is
belittled
while
monkish
merits
are
aggrandized
they
confess
christ
with
their
lips
and
at
the
same
time
deny
his
power
to
save
i
myself
was
at
one
time
entangled
in
this
error
i
thought
christ
was
a
judge
and
had
to
be
pacified
by
a
strict
adherence
to
the
rules
of
my
order
but
now
i
give
thanks
unto
god
the
father
of
all
mercies
who
has
called
me
out
of
darkness
into
the
light
of
his
glorious
gospel
and
has
granted
unto
me
the
saving
knowledge
of
christ
jesus
my
lord
we
conclude
with
paul
that
we
are
justified
by
faith
in
christ
without
the
law
once
a
person
has
been
justified
by
christ
he
will
not
be
unproductive
of
good
but
as
a
good
tree
he
will
bring
forth
good
fruit
a
believer
has
the
holy
spirit
and
the
holy
spirit
will
not
permit
a
person
to
remain
idle
but
will
put
him
to
work
and
stir
him
up
to
the
love
of
god
to
patient
suffering
in
affliction
to
prayer
thanksgiving
to
the
habit
of
charity
towards
all
men
verse
for
i
through
the
law
am
dead
to
the
law
that
i
might
live
unto
god
this
cheering
form
of
speech
is
frequently
met
with
in
the
scriptures
particularly
in
the
writings
of
paul
when
the
law
is
set
against
the
law
and
sin
is
made
to
oppose
sin
and
death
is
arrayed
against
death
and
hell
is
turned
loose
against
hell
as
in
the
following
quotations
thou
hast
led
captivity
captive
psalm
o
death
i
will
be
thy
plagues
o
grave
i
will
be
thy
destruction
hosea
and
for
sin
condemned
sin
in
the
flesh
romans
here
paul
plays
the
law
against
the
law
as
if
to
say
the
law
of
moses
condemns
me
but
i
have
another
law
the
law
of
grace
and
liberty
which
condemns
the
accusing
law
of
moses
on
first
sight
paul
seems
to
be
advancing
a
strange
and
ugly
heresy
he
says
i
am
dead
to
the
law
that
i
might
live
unto
god
the
false
apostles
said
the
very
opposite
they
said
if
you
do
not
live
to
the
law
you
are
dead
unto
god
the
doctrine
of
our
opponents
is
similar
to
that
of
the
false
apostles
in
paul
day
our
opponents
teach
if
you
want
to
live
unto
god
you
must
live
after
the
law
for
it
is
written
do
this
and
thou
shalt
live
paul
on
the
other
hand
teaches
we
can
not
live
unto
god
unless
we
are
dead
unto
the
law
if
we
are
dead
unto
the
law
the
law
can
have
no
power
over
us
paul
does
not
only
refer
to
the
ceremonial
law
but
to
the
whole
law
we
are
not
to
think
that
the
law
is
wiped
out
it
stays
it
continues
to
operate
in
the
wicked
but
a
christian
is
dead
to
the
law
for
example
christ
by
his
resurrection
became
free
from
the
grave
and
yet
the
grave
remains
peter
was
delivered
from
prison
yet
the
prison
remains
the
law
is
abolished
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
when
it
has
driven
me
into
the
arms
of
christ
yet
the
law
continues
to
exist
and
to
function
but
it
no
longer
exists
for
me
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
law
cries
paul
he
could
not
have
uttered
anything
more
devastating
to
the
prestige
of
the
law
he
declares
that
he
does
not
care
for
the
law
that
he
does
not
intend
ever
to
be
justified
by
the
law
to
be
dead
to
the
law
means
to
be
free
of
the
law
what
right
then
has
the
law
to
accuse
me
or
to
hold
anything
against
me
when
you
see
a
person
squirming
in
the
clutches
of
the
law
say
to
him
brother
get
things
straight
you
let
the
law
talk
to
your
conscience
make
it
talk
to
your
flesh
wake
up
and
believe
in
jesus
christ
the
conqueror
of
law
and
sin
faith
in
christ
will
lift
you
high
above
the
law
into
the
heaven
of
grace
though
law
and
sin
remain
they
no
longer
concern
you
because
you
are
dead
to
the
law
and
dead
to
sin
blessed
is
the
person
who
knows
how
to
use
this
truth
in
times
of
distress
he
can
talk
he
can
say
law
go
ahead
and
accuse
me
as
much
as
you
like
i
know
i
have
committed
many
sins
and
i
continue
to
sin
daily
but
that
does
not
bother
me
you
have
got
to
shout
louder
law
i
am
deaf
you
know
talk
as
much
as
you
like
i
am
dead
to
you
if
you
want
to
talk
to
me
about
my
sins
go
and
talk
to
my
flesh
belabor
that
but
do
talk
to
my
conscience
my
conscience
is
a
lady
and
a
queen
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
likes
of
you
because
my
conscience
lives
to
christ
under
another
law
a
new
and
better
law
the
law
of
grace
we
have
two
propositions
to
live
unto
the
law
is
to
die
unto
god
to
die
unto
the
law
is
to
live
unto
god
these
two
propositions
go
against
reason
no
can
ever
understand
them
but
see
to
it
that
you
understand
them
the
law
can
never
justify
and
save
a
sinner
the
law
can
only
accuse
terrify
and
kill
him
therefore
to
live
unto
the
law
is
to
die
unto
god
vice
versa
to
die
unto
the
law
is
to
live
unto
god
if
you
want
to
live
unto
god
bury
the
law
and
find
life
through
faith
in
christ
jesus
we
have
enough
arguments
right
here
to
conclude
that
justification
is
by
faith
alone
how
can
the
law
effect
our
justification
when
paul
so
plainly
states
that
we
must
be
dead
to
the
law
if
we
want
to
live
unto
god
if
we
are
dead
to
the
law
and
the
law
is
dead
to
us
how
can
it
possibly
contribute
anything
to
our
justification
there
is
nothing
left
for
us
but
to
be
justified
by
faith
alone
this
nineteenth
verse
is
loaded
with
consolation
it
fortifies
a
person
against
every
danger
it
allows
you
to
argue
like
this
i
confess
i
have
sinned
then
god
will
punish
you
no
he
will
not
do
that
why
not
does
not
the
law
say
so
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
law
how
so
i
have
another
law
the
law
of
liberty
what
do
you
mean
the
liberty
of
christ
for
christ
has
made
me
free
from
the
law
that
held
me
down
that
law
is
now
in
prison
itself
held
captive
by
grace
and
liberty
by
faith
in
christ
a
person
may
gain
such
sure
and
sound
comfort
that
he
need
not
fear
the
devil
sin
death
or
any
evil
sir
devil
he
may
say
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
i
have
a
friend
whose
name
is
jesus
christ
in
whom
i
believe
he
has
abolished
the
law
condemned
sin
vanquished
death
and
destroyed
hell
for
me
he
is
bigger
than
you
satan
he
has
licked
you
and
holds
you
down
you
can
not
hurt
me
this
is
the
faith
that
overcomes
the
devil
paul
manhandles
the
law
he
treats
the
law
as
if
it
were
a
thief
and
a
robber
he
treats
the
law
as
contemptible
to
the
conscience
in
order
that
those
who
believe
in
christ
may
take
courage
to
defy
the
law
and
say
law
i
am
a
sinner
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
or
take
death
christ
is
risen
from
death
why
should
we
now
fear
the
grave
against
my
death
i
set
another
death
or
rather
life
my
life
in
christ
oh
the
sweet
names
of
jesus
he
is
called
my
law
against
the
law
my
sin
against
sin
my
death
against
death
translated
it
means
that
he
is
my
righteousness
my
life
my
everlasting
salvation
for
this
reason
was
he
made
the
law
of
the
law
the
sin
of
sin
the
death
of
death
that
he
might
redeem
me
from
the
curse
of
the
law
he
permitted
the
law
to
accuse
him
sin
to
condemn
him
and
death
to
take
him
to
abolish
the
law
to
condemn
sin
and
to
destroy
death
for
me
this
peculiar
form
of
speech
sounds
much
sweeter
than
if
paul
had
said
i
through
liberty
am
dead
to
the
law
by
putting
it
in
this
way
i
through
the
law
am
dead
to
the
law
he
opposes
one
law
with
another
law
and
has
them
fight
it
out
in
this
masterly
fashion
paul
draws
our
attention
away
from
the
law
sin
death
and
every
evil
and
centers
it
upon
christ
verse
i
am
crucified
with
christ
christ
is
lord
over
the
law
because
he
was
crucified
unto
the
law
i
also
am
lord
over
the
law
because
by
faith
i
am
crucified
with
christ
paul
does
not
here
speak
of
crucifying
the
flesh
but
he
speaks
of
that
higher
crucifying
wherein
sin
devil
and
death
are
crucified
in
christ
and
in
me
by
my
faith
in
christ
i
am
crucified
with
christ
hence
these
evils
are
crucified
and
dead
unto
me
verse
nevertheless
i
live
i
do
not
mean
to
create
the
impression
as
though
i
did
not
live
before
this
but
in
reality
i
first
live
now
now
that
i
have
been
delivered
from
the
law
from
sin
and
death
being
crucified
with
christ
and
dead
unto
the
law
i
may
now
rise
unto
a
new
and
better
life
we
must
pay
close
attention
to
paul
way
of
speaking
he
says
that
we
are
crucified
and
dead
unto
the
law
the
fact
is
the
law
is
crucified
and
dead
unto
us
paul
purposely
speaks
that
way
in
order
to
increase
the
portion
of
our
comfort
verse
yet
not
paul
explains
what
constitutes
true
christian
righteousness
true
christian
righteousness
is
the
righteousness
of
christ
who
lives
in
us
we
must
look
away
from
our
own
person
christ
and
my
conscience
must
become
one
so
that
i
can
see
nothing
else
but
christ
crucified
and
raised
from
the
dead
for
me
if
i
keep
on
looking
at
myself
i
am
gone
if
we
lose
sight
of
christ
and
begin
to
consider
our
past
we
simply
go
to
pieces
we
must
turn
our
eyes
to
the
brazen
serpent
christ
crucified
and
believe
with
all
our
heart
that
he
is
our
righteousness
and
our
life
for
christ
on
whom
our
eyes
are
fixed
in
whom
we
live
who
lives
in
us
is
lord
over
law
sin
death
and
all
evil
verse
but
christ
liveth
in
me
thus
i
live
the
apostle
starts
out
but
presently
he
corrects
himself
saying
yet
not
i
but
christ
liveth
in
me
he
is
the
form
of
my
perfection
he
embellishes
my
faith
since
christ
is
now
living
in
me
he
abolishes
the
law
condemns
sin
and
destroys
death
in
me
these
foes
vanish
in
his
presence
christ
abiding
in
me
drives
out
every
evil
this
union
with
christ
delivers
me
from
the
demands
of
the
law
and
separates
me
from
my
sinful
self
as
long
as
i
abide
in
christ
nothing
can
hurt
me
christ
domiciling
in
me
the
old
adam
has
to
stay
outside
and
remain
subject
to
the
law
think
what
grace
righteousness
life
peace
and
salvation
there
is
in
me
thanks
to
that
inseparable
conjunction
between
christ
and
me
through
faith
paul
has
a
peculiar
style
a
celestial
way
of
speaking
i
live
he
says
i
live
not
i
am
dead
i
am
not
dead
i
am
a
sinner
i
am
not
a
sinner
i
have
the
law
i
have
no
law
when
we
look
at
ourselves
we
find
plenty
of
sin
but
when
we
look
at
christ
we
have
no
sin
whenever
we
separate
the
person
of
christ
from
our
own
person
we
live
under
the
law
and
not
in
christ
we
are
condemned
by
the
law
dead
before
god
faith
connects
you
so
intimately
with
christ
that
he
and
you
become
as
it
were
one
person
as
such
you
may
boldly
say
i
am
now
one
with
christ
therefore
christ
righteousness
victory
and
life
are
mine
on
the
other
hand
christ
may
say
i
am
that
big
sinner
his
sins
and
his
death
are
mine
because
he
is
joined
to
me
and
i
to
him
whenever
remission
of
sins
is
freely
proclaimed
people
misinterpret
it
according
to
romans
let
us
do
evil
that
good
may
come
as
soon
as
people
hear
that
we
are
not
justified
by
the
law
they
reason
maliciously
why
then
let
us
reject
the
law
if
grace
abounds
where
sin
abounds
let
us
abound
in
sin
that
grace
may
all
the
more
abound
people
who
reason
thus
are
reckless
they
make
sport
of
the
scriptures
and
slander
the
sayings
of
the
holy
ghost
however
there
are
others
who
are
not
malicious
only
weak
who
may
take
offense
when
told
that
law
and
good
works
are
unnecessary
for
salvation
these
must
be
instructed
as
to
why
good
works
do
not
justify
and
from
what
motives
good
works
must
be
done
good
works
are
not
the
cause
but
the
fruit
of
righteousness
when
we
have
become
righteous
then
first
are
we
able
and
willing
to
do
good
the
tree
makes
the
apple
the
apple
does
not
make
the
tree
verse
and
the
life
which
i
now
live
in
the
flesh
i
live
by
the
faith
of
the
son
of
god
paul
does
not
deny
the
fact
that
he
is
living
in
the
flesh
he
performs
the
natural
functions
of
the
flesh
but
he
says
that
this
is
not
his
real
life
his
life
in
the
flesh
is
not
a
life
after
the
flesh
i
live
by
the
faith
of
the
son
of
god
he
says
my
speech
is
no
longer
directed
by
the
flesh
but
by
the
holy
ghost
my
sight
is
no
longer
governed
by
the
flesh
but
by
the
holy
ghost
my
hearing
is
no
longer
determined
by
the
flesh
but
by
the
holy
ghost
i
can
not
teach
write
pray
or
give
thanks
without
the
instrumentality
of
the
flesh
yet
these
activities
do
not
proceed
from
the
flesh
but
from
god
a
christian
uses
earthly
means
like
any
unbeliever
outwardly
they
look
alike
nevertheless
there
is
a
great
difference
between
them
i
may
live
in
the
flesh
but
i
do
not
live
after
the
flesh
i
do
my
living
now
by
the
faith
of
the
son
of
god
paul
had
the
same
voice
the
same
tongue
before
and
after
his
conversion
before
his
conversion
his
tongue
uttered
blasphemies
but
after
his
conversion
his
tongue
spoke
a
spiritual
heavenly
language
we
may
now
understand
how
spiritual
life
originates
it
enters
the
heart
by
faith
christ
reigns
in
the
heart
with
his
holy
spirit
who
sees
hears
speaks
works
suffers
and
does
all
things
in
and
through
us
over
the
protest
and
the
resistance
of
the
flesh
verse
who
loved
me
and
gave
himself
for
me
the
sophistical
papists
assert
that
a
person
is
able
by
natural
strength
to
love
god
long
before
grace
has
entered
his
heart
and
to
perform
works
of
real
merit
they
believe
they
are
able
to
fulfill
the
commandments
of
god
they
believe
they
are
able
to
do
more
than
god
expects
of
them
so
that
they
are
in
a
position
to
sell
their
superfluous
merits
to
laymen
thereby
saving
themselves
and
others
they
are
saving
nobody
on
the
contrary
they
abolish
the
gospel
they
deride
deny
and
blaspheme
christ
and
call
upon
themselves
the
wrath
of
god
this
is
what
they
get
for
living
in
their
own
righteousness
and
not
in
the
faith
of
the
son
of
god
the
papists
will
tell
you
to
do
the
best
you
can
and
god
will
give
you
his
grace
they
have
a
rhyme
for
it
god
will
no
more
require
of
man
than
of
himself
perform
he
can
this
may
hold
true
in
ordinary
civic
life
but
the
papists
apply
it
to
the
spiritual
realm
where
a
person
can
perform
nothing
but
sin
because
he
is
sold
under
sin
our
opponents
go
even
further
than
that
they
say
nature
is
depraved
but
the
qualities
of
nature
are
untainted
again
we
say
this
may
hold
true
in
everyday
life
but
not
in
the
spiritual
life
in
spiritual
matters
a
person
is
by
nature
full
of
darkness
error
ignorance
malice
and
perverseness
in
will
and
in
mind
in
view
of
this
paul
declares
that
christ
began
and
not
we
he
loved
me
and
gave
himself
for
me
he
found
in
me
no
right
mind
and
no
good
will
but
the
good
lord
had
mercy
upon
me
out
of
pure
kindness
he
loved
me
loved
me
so
that
he
gave
himself
for
me
that
i
should
be
free
from
the
law
from
sin
devil
and
death
the
words
the
son
of
god
who
loved
me
and
gave
himself
for
me
are
so
many
thunderclaps
and
lightning
bolts
of
protest
from
heaven
against
the
righteousness
of
the
law
the
wickedness
error
darkness
ignorance
in
my
mind
and
my
will
were
so
great
that
it
was
quite
impossible
for
me
to
be
saved
by
any
other
means
than
by
the
inestimable
price
of
christ
death
let
us
count
the
price
when
you
hear
that
such
an
enormous
price
was
paid
for
you
will
you
still
come
along
with
your
cowl
your
shaven
pate
your
chastity
your
obedience
your
poverty
your
works
your
merits
what
do
you
want
with
all
these
trappings
what
good
are
the
works
of
all
men
and
all
the
pains
of
the
martyrs
in
comparison
with
the
pains
of
the
son
of
god
dying
on
the
cross
so
that
there
was
not
a
drop
of
his
precious
blood
but
it
was
all
shed
for
your
sins
if
you
could
properly
evaluate
this
incomparable
price
you
would
throw
all
your
ceremonies
vows
works
and
merits
into
the
ash
can
what
awful
presumption
to
imagine
that
there
is
any
work
good
enough
to
pacify
god
when
to
pacify
god
required
the
invaluable
price
of
the
death
and
blood
of
his
own
and
only
son
verse
for
me
who
is
this
me
i
wretched
and
damnable
sinner
dearly
beloved
of
the
son
of
god
if
i
could
by
work
or
merit
love
the
son
of
god
and
come
to
him
why
should
he
have
sacrificed
himself
for
me
this
shows
how
the
papists
ignore
the
scriptures
particularly
the
doctrine
of
faith
if
they
had
paid
any
attention
at
all
to
these
words
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
the
son
of
god
to
be
given
into
death
for
me
they
would
never
have
invented
so
many
hideous
heresies
i
always
say
there
is
no
remedy
against
the
sects
no
power
to
resist
them
except
this
article
of
christian
righteousness
if
we
lose
this
article
we
shall
never
be
able
to
combat
errors
or
sects
what
business
have
they
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
works
or
merits
if
i
a
condemned
sinner
could
have
been
purchased
and
redeemed
by
any
other
price
why
should
the
son
of
god
have
given
himself
for
me
just
because
there
was
no
other
price
in
heaven
and
on
earth
big
and
good
enough
was
it
necessary
for
the
son
of
god
to
be
delivered
for
me
this
he
did
out
of
his
great
love
for
me
for
the
apostle
says
who
loved
me
did
the
law
ever
love
me
did
the
law
ever
sacrifice
itself
for
me
did
the
law
ever
die
for
me
on
the
contrary
it
accuses
me
it
frightens
me
it
drives
me
crazy
somebody
else
saved
me
from
the
law
from
sin
and
death
unto
eternal
life
that
somebody
is
the
son
of
god
to
whom
be
praise
and
glory
forever
hence
christ
is
no
moses
no
tyrant
no
lawgiver
but
the
giver
of
grace
the
savior
full
of
mercy
in
short
he
is
no
less
than
infinite
mercy
and
ineffable
goodness
bountifully
giving
himself
for
us
visualize
christ
in
these
his
true
colors
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
easy
even
in
the
present
diffusion
of
the
gospel
light
i
have
much
trouble
to
see
christ
as
paul
portrays
him
so
deeply
has
the
diseased
opinion
that
christ
is
a
lawgiver
sunk
into
my
bones
you
younger
men
are
a
good
deal
better
off
than
we
who
are
old
you
have
never
become
infected
with
the
nefarious
errors
on
which
i
suckled
all
my
youth
until
at
the
mention
of
the
name
of
christ
i
shivered
with
fear
you
i
say
who
are
young
may
learn
to
know
christ
in
all
his
sweetness
for
christ
is
joy
and
sweetness
to
a
broken
heart
christ
is
a
lover
of
poor
sinners
and
such
a
lover
that
he
gave
himself
for
us
now
if
this
is
true
and
it
is
true
then
are
we
never
justified
by
our
own
righteousness
read
the
words
me
and
for
me
with
great
emphasis
print
this
me
with
capital
letters
in
your
heart
and
do
not
ever
doubt
that
you
belong
to
the
number
of
those
who
are
meant
by
this
me
christ
did
not
only
love
peter
and
paul
the
same
love
he
felt
for
them
he
feels
for
us
if
we
can
not
deny
that
we
are
sinners
we
can
not
deny
that
christ
died
for
our
sins
verse
i
do
not
frustrate
the
grace
of
god
paul
is
now
getting
ready
for
the
second
argument
of
his
epistle
to
the
effect
that
to
seek
justification
by
works
of
the
law
is
to
reject
the
grace
of
god
i
ask
you
what
sin
can
be
more
horrible
than
to
reject
the
grace
of
god
and
to
refuse
the
righteousness
of
christ
it
is
bad
enough
that
we
are
wicked
sinners
and
transgressors
of
all
the
commandments
of
god
on
top
of
that
to
refuse
the
grace
of
god
and
the
remission
of
sins
offered
unto
us
by
christ
is
the
worst
sin
of
all
the
sin
of
sins
that
is
the
limit
there
is
no
sin
which
paul
and
the
other
apostles
detested
more
than
when
a
person
despises
the
grace
of
god
in
christ
jesus
still
there
is
no
sin
more
common
that
is
why
paul
can
get
so
angry
at
the
antichrist
because
he
snubs
christ
rebuffs
the
grace
of
god
and
refuses
the
merit
of
christ
what
else
would
you
call
it
but
spitting
in
christ
face
pushing
christ
to
the
side
usurping
christ
throne
and
to
say
i
am
going
to
justify
you
people
i
am
going
to
save
you
by
what
means
by
masses
pilgrimages
pardons
merits
etc
for
this
is
antichrist
doctrine
faith
is
no
good
unless
it
is
reinforced
by
works
by
this
abominable
doctrine
antichrist
has
spoiled
darkened
and
buried
the
benefit
of
christ
and
in
place
of
the
grace
of
christ
and
his
kingdom
he
has
established
the
doctrine
of
works
and
the
kingdom
of
ceremonies
we
despise
the
grace
of
god
when
we
observe
the
law
for
the
purpose
of
being
justified
the
law
is
good
holy
and
profitable
but
it
does
not
justify
to
keep
the
law
in
order
to
be
justified
means
to
reject
grace
to
deny
christ
to
despise
his
sacrifice
and
to
be
lost
verse
for
if
righteousness
come
by
the
law
then
christ
is
dead
in
vain
did
christ
die
or
did
he
not
die
was
his
death
worth
while
or
was
it
not
if
his
death
was
worth
while
it
follows
that
righteousness
does
not
come
by
the
law
why
was
christ
born
anyway
why
was
he
crucified
why
did
he
suffer
why
did
he
love
me
and
give
himself
for
me
it
was
all
done
to
no
purpose
if
righteousness
is
to
be
had
by
the
law
or
do
you
think
that
god
spared
not
his
son
but
delivered
him
for
us
all
for
the
fun
of
it
before
i
would
admit
anything
like
that
i
would
consign
the
holiness
of
the
saints
and
of
the
angels
to
hell
to
reject
the
grace
of
god
is
a
common
sin
of
which
everybody
is
guilty
who
sees
any
righteousness
in
himself
or
in
his
deeds
and
the
pope
is
the
sole
author
of
this
iniquity
not
content
to
spoil
the
gospel
of
christ
he
has
filled
the
world
with
his
cursed
traditions
his
bulls
and
indulgences
we
will
always
affirm
with
paul
that
either
christ
died
in
vain
or
else
the
law
can
not
justify
us
but
christ
did
not
suffer
and
die
in
vain
hence
the
law
does
not
justify
if
my
salvation
was
so
difficult
to
accomplish
that
it
necessitated
the
death
of
christ
then
all
my
works
all
the
righteousness
of
the
law
are
good
for
nothing
how
can
i
buy
for
a
penny
what
cost
a
million
dollars
the
law
is
a
penny
worth
when
you
compare
it
with
christ
should
i
be
so
stupid
as
to
reject
the
righteousness
of
christ
which
cost
me
nothing
and
slave
like
a
fool
to
achieve
the
righteousness
of
the
law
which
god
disdains
man
own
righteousness
is
in
the
last
analysis
a
despising
and
rejecting
of
the
grace
of
god
no
combination
of
words
can
do
justice
to
such
an
outrage
it
is
an
insult
to
say
that
any
man
died
in
vain
but
to
say
that
christ
died
in
vain
is
a
deadly
insult
to
say
that
christ
died
in
vain
is
to
make
his
resurrection
his
victory
his
glory
his
kingdom
heaven
earth
god
himself
of
no
purpose
and
benefit
whatever
that
is
enough
to
set
any
person
against
the
righteousness
of
the
law
and
all
the
trimmings
of
men
own
righteousness
the
orders
of
monks
and
friars
and
their
superstitions
who
would
not
detest
his
own
vows
his
cowls
his
shaven
crown
his
bearded
traditions
yes
the
very
law
of
moses
when
he
hears
that
for
such
things
he
rejected
the
grace
of
god
and
the
death
of
christ
it
seems
that
such
a
horrible
wickedness
could
not
enter
a
man
heart
that
he
should
reject
the
grace
of
god
and
despise
the
death
of
christ
and
yet
this
atrocity
is
all
too
common
let
us
be
warned
everyone
who
seeks
righteousness
without
christ
either
by
works
merits
satisfactions
actions
or
by
the
law
rejects
the
grace
of
god
and
despises
the
death
of
christ
chapter
verse
foolish
galatians
the
apostle
paul
manifests
his
apostolic
care
for
the
galatians
sometimes
he
entreats
them
then
again
he
reproaches
them
in
accordance
with
his
own
advice
to
timothy
preach
the
word
be
instant
in
season
out
of
season
reprove
rebuke
exhort
in
the
midst
of
his
discourse
on
christian
righteousness
paul
breaks
off
and
turns
to
address
the
galatians
o
foolish
galatians
he
cries
i
have
brought
you
the
true
gospel
and
you
received
it
with
eagerness
and
gratitude
now
all
of
a
sudden
you
drop
the
gospel
what
has
got
into
you
paul
reproves
the
galatians
rather
sharply
when
he
calls
them
fools
bewitched
and
disobedient
whether
he
is
indignant
or
sorry
i
can
not
say
he
may
be
both
it
is
the
duty
of
a
christian
pastor
to
reprove
the
people
committed
to
his
charge
of
course
his
anger
must
not
flow
from
malice
but
from
affection
and
a
real
zeal
for
christ
there
is
no
question
that
paul
is
disappointed
it
hurts
him
to
think
that
his
galatians
showed
so
little
stability
we
can
hear
him
say
i
am
sorry
to
hear
of
your
troubles
and
disappointed
in
you
for
the
disgraceful
part
you
played
i
say
rather
much
on
this
point
to
save
paul
from
the
charge
that
he
railed
upon
the
churches
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
gospel
a
certain
distance
and
coolness
can
be
noted
in
the
title
with
which
the
apostle
addresses
the
galatians
he
does
not
now
address
them
as
his
brethren
as
he
usually
does
he
addresses
them
as
galatians
in
order
to
remind
them
of
their
national
trait
to
be
foolish
we
have
here
an
example
of
bad
traits
that
often
cling
to
individual
christians
and
entire
congregations
grace
does
not
suddenly
transform
a
christian
into
a
new
and
perfect
creature
dregs
of
the
old
and
natural
corruption
remain
the
spirit
of
god
can
not
at
once
overcome
human
deficiency
sanctification
takes
time
although
the
galatians
had
been
enlightened
by
the
holy
spirit
through
the
preaching
of
faith
something
of
their
national
trait
of
foolishness
plus
their
original
depravity
clung
to
them
let
no
man
think
that
once
he
has
received
faith
he
can
presently
be
converted
into
a
faultless
creature
the
leavings
of
old
vices
will
stick
to
him
be
he
ever
so
good
a
christian
verse
who
hath
bewitched
you
that
ye
should
not
obey
the
truth
paul
calls
the
galatians
foolish
and
bewitched
in
the
fifth
chapter
he
mentions
sorcery
among
the
works
of
the
flesh
declaring
that
witchcraft
and
sorcery
are
real
manifestations
and
legitimate
activities
of
the
devil
we
are
all
exposed
to
the
influence
of
the
devil
because
he
is
the
prince
and
god
of
the
world
in
which
we
live
satan
is
clever
he
does
not
only
bewitch
men
in
a
crude
manner
but
also
in
a
more
artful
fashion
he
bedevils
the
minds
of
men
with
hideous
fallacies
not
only
is
he
able
to
deceive
the
but
even
those
who
profess
the
true
christian
faith
there
is
not
one
among
us
who
is
not
at
times
seduced
by
satan
into
false
beliefs
this
accounts
for
the
many
new
battles
we
have
to
wage
nowadays
but
the
attacks
of
the
old
serpent
are
not
without
profit
to
us
for
they
confirm
our
doctrine
and
strengthen
our
faith
in
christ
many
a
time
we
were
wrestled
down
in
these
conflicts
with
satan
but
christ
has
always
triumphed
and
always
will
triumph
do
not
think
that
the
galatians
were
the
only
ones
to
be
bewitched
by
the
devil
let
us
realize
that
we
too
may
be
seduced
by
satan
verse
who
hath
bewitched
you
in
this
sentence
paul
excuses
the
galatians
while
he
blames
the
false
apostles
for
the
apostasy
of
the
galatians
as
if
he
were
saying
i
know
your
defection
was
not
willful
the
devil
sent
the
false
apostles
to
you
and
they
tallied
you
into
believing
that
you
are
justified
by
the
law
with
this
our
epistle
we
endeavor
to
undo
the
damage
which
the
false
apostles
have
inflicted
upon
you
like
paul
we
struggle
with
the
word
of
god
against
the
fanatical
anabaptists
of
our
day
and
our
efforts
are
not
entirely
in
vain
the
trouble
is
there
are
many
who
refuse
to
be
instructed
they
will
not
listen
to
reason
they
will
not
listen
to
the
scriptures
because
they
are
bewitched
by
the
tricky
devil
who
can
make
a
lie
look
like
the
truth
since
the
devil
has
this
uncanny
ability
to
make
us
believe
a
lie
until
we
would
swear
a
thousand
times
it
were
the
truth
we
must
not
be
proud
but
walk
in
fear
and
humility
and
call
upon
the
lord
jesus
to
save
us
from
temptation
although
i
am
a
doctor
of
divinity
and
have
preached
christ
and
fought
his
battles
for
a
long
time
i
know
from
personal
experience
how
difficult
it
is
to
hold
fast
to
the
truth
i
can
not
always
shake
off
satan
i
can
not
always
apprehend
christ
as
the
scriptures
portray
him
sometimes
the
devil
distorts
christ
to
my
vision
but
thanks
be
to
god
who
keeps
us
in
his
word
in
faith
and
in
prayer
the
spiritual
witchery
of
the
devil
creates
in
the
heart
a
wrong
idea
of
christ
those
who
share
the
opinion
that
a
person
is
justified
by
the
works
of
the
law
are
simply
bewitched
their
belief
goes
against
faith
and
christ
verse
that
ye
should
not
obey
the
truth
paul
incriminates
the
galatians
in
worse
failure
you
are
so
bewitched
that
you
no
longer
obey
the
truth
i
fear
many
of
you
have
strayed
so
far
that
you
will
never
return
to
the
truth
the
apostasy
of
the
galatians
is
a
fine
indorsement
of
the
law
all
right
you
may
preach
the
law
ever
so
fervently
if
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
does
not
accompany
it
the
law
will
never
produce
true
conversion
and
heartfelt
repentance
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
preaching
of
the
law
is
without
value
but
it
only
serves
to
bring
home
to
us
the
wrath
of
god
the
law
bows
a
person
down
it
takes
the
gospel
and
the
preaching
of
faith
in
christ
to
raise
and
save
a
person
verse
before
whose
eyes
jesus
christ
hath
been
evidently
set
forth
paul
increasing
severity
becomes
apparent
as
he
reminds
the
galatians
that
they
disobeyed
the
truth
in
defiance
of
the
vivid
description
he
had
given
them
of
christ
so
vividly
had
he
described
christ
to
them
that
they
could
almost
see
and
handle
him
as
if
paul
were
to
say
no
artist
with
all
his
colors
could
have
pictured
christ
to
you
as
vividly
as
i
have
pictured
him
to
you
by
my
preaching
yet
you
permitted
yourselves
to
be
seduced
to
the
extent
that
you
disobeyed
the
truth
of
christ
verse
crucified
among
you
you
have
not
only
rejected
the
grace
of
god
you
have
shamefully
crucified
christ
among
you
paul
employs
the
same
phraseology
in
hebrews
seeing
they
crucify
to
themselves
the
son
of
god
afresh
and
put
him
to
an
open
shame
it
should
make
any
person
afraid
to
hear
paul
say
that
those
who
seek
to
be
justified
by
the
law
not
only
deny
christ
but
also
crucify
him
anew
if
those
who
seek
to
be
justified
by
the
law
and
its
works
are
crucifiers
of
christ
what
are
they
i
like
to
know
who
seek
salvation
by
the
filthy
rags
of
their
own
can
there
be
anything
more
horrible
than
the
papacy
an
alliance
of
people
who
crucify
christ
in
themselves
in
the
church
and
in
the
hearts
of
the
believers
of
all
the
diseased
and
vicious
doctrines
of
the
papacy
the
worst
is
this
if
you
want
to
serve
god
you
must
earn
your
own
remission
of
sins
and
everlasting
life
and
in
addition
help
others
to
obtain
salvation
by
giving
them
the
benefit
of
your
extra
monks
friars
and
all
the
rest
of
them
brag
that
besides
the
ordinary
requirements
common
to
all
christians
they
do
the
works
of
supererogation
the
performance
of
more
than
is
required
this
is
certainly
a
fiendish
illusion
no
wonder
paul
employs
such
sharp
language
in
his
effort
to
recall
the
galatians
from
the
doctrine
of
the
false
apostles
he
says
to
them
do
you
realize
what
you
have
done
you
have
crucified
christ
anew
because
you
seek
salvation
by
the
law
true
christ
can
no
longer
be
crucified
in
person
but
he
is
crucified
in
us
when
we
reject
grace
faith
free
remission
of
sins
and
endeavor
to
be
justified
by
our
own
works
or
by
the
works
of
the
law
the
apostle
is
incensed
at
the
presumptuousness
of
any
person
who
thinks
he
can
perform
the
law
of
god
to
his
own
salvation
he
charges
that
person
with
the
atrocity
of
crucifying
anew
the
son
of
god
verse
this
only
would
i
learn
of
you
received
ye
the
spirit
by
the
works
of
the
law
or
by
the
hearing
of
faith
there
is
a
touch
of
irony
in
these
words
of
the
apostle
come
on
now
my
smart
galatians
you
who
all
of
a
sudden
have
become
doctors
while
i
seem
to
be
your
pupil
received
ye
the
holy
ghost
by
the
works
of
the
law
or
by
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
this
question
gave
them
something
to
think
about
because
their
own
experience
contradicted
them
you
can
not
say
that
you
received
the
holy
spirit
by
the
law
as
long
as
you
were
servants
of
the
law
you
never
received
the
holy
ghost
nobody
ever
heard
of
the
holy
ghost
being
given
to
anybody
be
he
doctor
or
dunce
as
a
result
of
the
preaching
of
the
law
in
your
own
case
you
have
not
only
learned
the
law
by
heart
you
have
labored
with
all
your
might
to
perform
it
you
most
of
all
should
have
received
the
holy
ghost
by
the
law
if
that
were
possible
you
can
not
show
me
that
this
ever
happened
but
as
soon
as
the
gospel
came
your
way
you
received
the
holy
ghost
by
the
simple
hearing
of
faith
before
you
ever
had
a
chance
to
do
a
single
good
deed
luke
verifies
this
statement
of
paul
in
the
book
of
acts
while
peter
yet
spake
these
words
the
holy
ghost
fell
on
all
them
which
heard
the
word
acts
and
as
i
began
to
speak
the
holy
ghost
fell
on
them
as
on
us
at
the
beginning
acts
try
to
appreciate
the
force
of
paul
argument
which
is
so
often
repeated
in
the
book
of
acts
that
book
was
written
for
the
express
purpose
of
verifying
paul
assertion
that
the
holy
ghost
comes
upon
men
not
in
response
to
the
preaching
of
the
law
but
in
response
to
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
when
peter
preached
christ
at
the
first
pentecost
the
holy
ghost
fell
upon
the
hearers
and
the
same
day
there
were
added
unto
them
about
three
thousand
souls
cornelius
received
the
holy
ghost
while
peter
was
speaking
of
christ
the
holy
ghost
fell
on
all
of
them
which
heard
the
word
these
are
actual
experiences
that
can
not
very
well
be
denied
when
paul
and
barnabas
returned
to
jerusalem
and
reported
what
they
had
been
able
to
accomplish
among
the
gentiles
the
whole
church
was
astonished
particularly
when
it
heard
that
the
uncircumcised
gentiles
had
received
the
holy
ghost
by
the
preaching
of
faith
in
christ
now
as
god
gave
the
holy
ghost
to
the
gentiles
without
the
law
by
the
simple
preaching
of
the
gospel
so
he
gave
the
holy
ghost
also
to
the
jews
without
the
law
through
faith
alone
if
the
righteousness
of
the
law
were
necessary
unto
salvation
the
holy
ghost
would
never
have
come
to
the
gentiles
because
they
did
not
bother
about
the
law
hence
the
law
does
not
justify
but
faith
in
christ
justifies
how
was
it
with
cornelius
cornelius
and
his
friends
whom
he
had
invited
over
to
his
house
do
nothing
but
sit
and
listen
peter
is
doing
the
talking
they
just
sit
and
do
nothing
the
law
is
far
removed
from
their
thoughts
they
burn
no
sacrifices
they
are
not
at
all
interested
in
circumcision
all
they
do
is
to
sit
and
listen
to
peter
suddenly
the
holy
ghost
enters
their
hearts
his
presence
is
unmistakable
for
they
spoke
with
tongues
and
magnified
god
right
here
we
have
one
more
difference
between
the
law
and
the
gospel
the
law
does
not
bring
on
the
holy
ghost
the
gospel
however
brings
on
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
because
it
is
the
nature
of
the
gospel
to
convey
good
gifts
the
law
and
the
gospel
are
contrary
ideas
they
have
contrary
functions
and
purposes
to
endow
the
law
with
any
capacity
to
produce
righteousness
is
to
plagiarize
the
gospel
the
gospel
brings
donations
it
pleads
for
open
hands
to
take
what
is
being
offered
the
law
has
nothing
to
give
it
demands
and
its
demands
are
impossible
our
opponents
come
back
at
us
with
cornelius
cornelius
they
point
out
was
a
devout
man
and
one
that
feared
god
with
all
his
house
which
gave
much
alms
to
the
people
and
prayed
god
always
because
of
these
qualifications
he
merited
the
forgiveness
of
sins
and
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
so
reason
our
opponents
i
answer
cornelius
was
a
gentile
you
can
not
deny
it
as
a
gentile
he
was
uncircumcised
as
a
gentile
he
did
not
observe
the
law
he
never
gave
the
law
any
thought
for
all
that
he
was
justified
and
received
the
holy
ghost
how
can
the
law
avail
anything
unto
righteousness
our
opponents
are
not
satisfied
they
reply
granted
that
cornelius
was
a
gentile
and
did
not
receive
the
holy
ghost
by
the
law
yet
the
text
plainly
states
that
he
was
a
devout
man
who
feared
god
gave
alms
and
prayed
do
you
think
he
deserved
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
i
answer
cornelius
had
the
faith
of
the
fathers
who
were
saved
by
faith
in
the
christ
to
come
if
cornelius
had
died
before
christ
he
would
have
been
saved
because
he
believed
in
the
christ
to
come
but
because
the
messiah
had
already
come
cornelius
had
to
be
apprized
of
the
fact
since
christ
has
come
we
can
not
be
saved
by
faith
in
the
christ
to
come
but
we
must
believe
that
he
has
come
the
object
of
peter
visit
was
to
acquaint
cornelius
with
the
fact
that
christ
was
no
longer
to
be
looked
for
because
he
is
here
as
to
the
contention
of
our
opponents
that
cornelius
deserved
grace
and
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
because
he
was
devout
and
just
we
say
that
these
attributes
are
the
characteristics
of
a
spiritual
person
who
already
has
faith
in
christ
and
not
the
characteristics
of
a
gentile
or
of
natural
man
luke
first
praises
cornelius
for
being
a
devout
and
man
and
then
luke
mentions
the
good
works
the
alms
and
prayers
of
cornelius
our
opponents
ignore
the
sequence
of
luke
words
they
pounce
on
this
one
sentence
which
gave
much
alms
to
the
people
because
it
serves
their
assertion
that
merit
precedes
grace
the
fact
is
that
cornelius
gave
alms
and
prayed
to
god
because
he
had
faith
and
because
of
his
faith
in
the
christ
to
come
peter
was
delegated
to
preach
unto
cornelius
faith
in
the
christ
who
had
already
come
this
argument
is
convincing
enough
cornelius
was
justified
without
the
law
therefore
the
law
can
not
justify
take
the
case
of
naaman
the
syrian
who
was
a
gentile
and
did
not
belong
to
the
race
of
moses
yet
his
flesh
was
cleansed
the
god
of
israel
was
revealed
unto
him
and
he
received
the
holy
ghost
naaman
confessed
his
faith
behold
now
i
know
that
there
is
no
god
in
all
the
earth
but
in
israel
ii
kings
naaman
does
not
do
a
thing
he
does
not
busy
himself
with
the
law
he
was
never
circumcised
that
does
not
mean
that
his
faith
was
inactive
he
said
to
the
prophet
elisha
thy
servant
will
henceforth
offer
neither
burnt
offering
nor
sacrifice
unto
other
gods
but
unto
the
lord
in
this
thing
the
lord
pardon
thy
servant
that
when
my
master
goeth
into
the
house
of
rimmon
to
worship
there
and
he
leaneth
on
my
hand
and
i
bow
myself
in
the
house
of
rimmon
when
i
bow
down
myself
in
the
house
of
rimmon
the
lord
pardon
thy
servant
in
this
thing
what
did
the
prophet
tell
him
go
in
peace
the
jews
do
not
like
to
hear
the
prophet
say
this
what
they
exclaim
should
this
heathen
be
justified
without
the
law
should
he
be
made
equal
to
us
who
are
circumcised
long
before
the
time
of
moses
god
justified
men
without
the
law
he
justified
many
kings
of
egypt
and
babylonia
he
justified
job
nineveh
that
great
city
was
justified
and
received
the
promise
of
god
that
he
would
not
destroy
the
city
why
was
nineveh
spared
not
because
it
fulfilled
the
law
but
because
nineveh
believed
the
word
of
god
the
prophet
jonah
writes
so
the
people
of
nineveh
believed
god
and
proclaimed
a
fast
and
put
on
sackcloth
they
repented
nowhere
in
the
book
of
jonah
do
you
read
that
the
ninevites
received
the
law
of
moses
or
that
they
were
circumcised
or
that
they
offered
sacrifices
all
this
happened
long
before
christ
was
born
if
the
gentiles
were
justified
without
the
law
and
quietly
received
the
holy
spirit
at
a
time
when
the
law
was
in
full
force
why
should
the
law
count
unto
righteousness
now
now
that
christ
has
fulfilled
the
law
and
yet
many
devote
much
time
and
labor
to
the
law
to
the
decrees
of
the
fathers
and
to
the
traditions
of
the
pope
many
of
these
specialists
have
incapacitated
themselves
for
any
kind
of
work
good
or
bad
by
their
rigorous
attention
to
rules
and
laws
all
the
same
they
could
not
obtain
a
quiet
conscience
and
peace
in
christ
but
the
moment
the
gospel
of
christ
touches
them
certainty
comes
to
them
and
joy
and
a
right
judgment
i
have
good
reason
for
enlarging
upon
this
point
the
heart
of
man
finds
it
difficult
to
believe
that
so
great
a
treasure
as
the
holy
ghost
is
gotten
by
the
mere
hearing
of
faith
the
hearer
likes
to
reason
like
this
forgiveness
of
sins
deliverance
from
death
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
everlasting
life
are
grand
things
if
you
want
to
obtain
these
priceless
benefits
you
must
engage
in
correspondingly
great
efforts
and
the
devil
says
amen
we
must
learn
that
forgiveness
of
sins
christ
and
the
holy
ghost
are
freely
granted
unto
us
at
the
preaching
of
faith
in
spite
of
our
sinfulness
we
are
not
to
waste
time
thinking
how
unworthy
we
are
of
the
blessings
of
god
we
are
to
know
that
it
pleased
god
freely
to
give
us
his
unspeakable
gifts
if
he
offers
his
gifts
free
of
charge
why
not
take
them
why
worry
about
our
lack
of
worthiness
why
not
accept
gifts
with
joy
and
thanksgiving
right
away
foolish
reason
is
once
more
offended
it
scolds
us
when
you
say
that
a
person
can
do
nothing
to
obtain
the
grace
of
god
you
foster
carnal
security
people
become
shiftless
and
will
do
no
good
at
all
better
not
preach
this
doctrine
of
faith
rather
urge
the
people
to
exert
and
to
exercise
themselves
in
good
works
so
that
the
holy
ghost
will
feel
like
coming
to
them
what
did
jesus
say
to
martha
when
she
was
very
careful
and
troubled
about
many
things
and
could
hardly
stand
to
see
her
sister
mary
sitting
at
the
feet
of
jesus
just
listening
martha
martha
jesus
said
thou
art
careful
and
troubled
about
many
things
but
one
thing
is
needful
and
mary
hath
chosen
that
good
part
which
shall
not
be
taken
away
from
her
a
person
becomes
a
christian
not
by
working
but
by
hearing
the
first
step
to
being
a
christian
is
to
hear
the
gospel
when
a
person
has
accepted
the
gospel
let
him
first
give
thanks
unto
god
with
a
glad
heart
and
then
let
him
get
busy
on
the
good
works
to
strive
for
works
that
really
please
god
and
not
and
works
our
opponents
regard
faith
as
an
easy
thing
but
i
know
from
personal
experience
how
hard
it
is
to
believe
that
the
holy
ghost
is
received
by
faith
is
quickly
said
but
not
so
quickly
done
all
believers
experience
this
difficulty
they
would
gladly
embrace
the
word
with
a
full
faith
but
the
flesh
deters
them
you
see
our
reason
always
thinks
it
is
too
easy
and
cheap
to
have
righteousness
the
holy
spirit
and
life
everlasting
by
the
mere
hearing
of
the
gospel
verse
are
ye
so
foolish
having
begun
in
the
spirit
are
ye
now
made
perfect
by
the
flesh
paul
now
begins
to
warn
the
galatians
against
a
twofold
danger
the
first
danger
is
are
ye
so
foolish
that
after
ye
have
begun
in
the
spirit
ye
would
now
end
in
the
flesh
flesh
stands
for
the
righteousness
of
reason
which
seeks
justification
by
the
accomplishment
of
the
law
i
am
told
that
i
began
in
the
spirit
under
the
papacy
but
am
ending
up
in
the
flesh
because
i
got
married
as
though
single
life
were
a
spiritual
life
and
married
life
a
carnal
life
they
are
silly
all
the
duties
of
a
christian
husband
to
love
his
wife
to
bring
up
his
children
to
govern
his
family
are
the
very
fruits
of
the
spirit
the
righteousness
of
the
law
which
paul
also
terms
the
righteousness
of
the
flesh
is
so
far
from
justifying
a
person
that
those
who
once
had
the
holy
spirit
and
lost
him
end
up
in
the
law
to
their
complete
destruction
verse
have
ye
suffered
so
many
things
in
vain
the
other
danger
against
which
the
apostle
warns
the
galatians
is
this
have
ye
suffered
so
many
things
in
vain
paul
wants
to
say
consider
not
only
the
good
start
you
had
and
lost
but
consider
also
the
many
things
you
have
suffered
for
the
sake
of
the
gospel
and
for
the
name
of
christ
you
have
suffered
the
loss
of
your
possessions
you
have
borne
reproaches
you
have
passed
through
many
dangers
of
body
and
life
you
endured
much
for
the
name
of
christ
and
you
endured
it
faithfully
but
now
you
have
lost
everything
the
gospel
faith
and
the
spiritual
benefit
of
your
sufferings
for
christ
sake
what
a
miserable
thing
to
endure
so
many
afflictions
for
nothing
verse
if
it
be
yet
in
vain
the
apostle
adds
the
afterthought
if
it
be
yet
in
vain
i
do
not
despair
of
all
hope
for
you
but
if
you
continue
to
look
to
the
law
for
righteousness
i
think
you
should
be
told
that
all
your
past
true
worship
of
god
and
all
the
afflictions
that
you
have
endured
for
christ
sake
are
going
to
help
you
not
at
all
i
do
not
mean
to
discourage
you
altogether
i
do
hope
you
will
repent
and
amend
verse
he
therefore
that
ministereth
to
you
the
spirit
and
worketh
miracles
among
you
doeth
he
it
by
the
works
of
the
law
or
by
the
hearing
of
faith
this
argument
based
on
the
experience
of
the
galatians
pleased
the
apostle
so
well
that
he
returns
to
it
after
he
had
warned
them
against
their
twofold
danger
you
have
not
only
received
the
spirit
by
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
but
by
the
same
gospel
you
were
enabled
to
do
things
what
things
we
ask
miracles
at
least
the
galatians
had
manifested
the
striking
fruits
of
faith
which
true
disciples
of
the
gospel
manifested
in
those
days
on
one
occasion
the
apostle
wrote
the
kingdom
of
god
is
not
in
word
but
in
power
this
power
revealed
itself
not
only
in
readiness
of
speech
but
in
demonstrations
of
the
supernatural
ability
of
the
holy
spirit
when
the
gospel
is
preached
unto
faith
hope
love
and
patience
god
gives
his
spirit
paul
reminds
the
galatians
of
this
god
had
not
only
brought
you
to
faith
by
my
preaching
he
had
also
sanctified
you
to
bring
forth
the
fruits
of
faith
and
one
of
the
fruits
of
your
faith
was
that
you
loved
me
so
devotedly
that
you
were
willing
to
pluck
out
your
eyes
for
me
to
love
a
so
devotedly
as
to
be
ready
to
bestow
upon
him
money
goods
eyes
in
order
to
secure
his
salvation
such
love
is
the
fruit
of
the
holy
spirit
these
products
of
the
spirit
you
enjoyed
before
the
false
apostles
misled
you
the
apostle
reminds
the
galatians
but
you
manifested
any
of
these
fruits
under
the
regime
of
the
law
how
does
it
come
that
you
do
not
grow
the
same
fruits
now
you
no
longer
teach
truly
you
do
not
believe
boldly
you
do
not
live
well
you
do
not
work
hard
you
do
not
bear
things
patiently
who
has
spoiled
you
that
you
no
longer
love
me
that
you
are
not
now
ready
to
pluck
out
your
eyes
for
me
what
has
happened
to
cool
your
personal
interest
in
me
the
same
thing
happened
to
me
when
i
began
to
proclaim
the
gospel
there
were
many
very
many
who
were
delighted
with
our
doctrine
and
had
a
good
opinion
of
us
and
now
now
they
have
succeeded
in
making
us
so
odious
to
those
who
formerly
loved
us
that
they
now
hate
us
like
poison
paul
argues
your
experience
ought
to
teach
you
that
the
fruits
of
love
do
not
grow
on
the
stump
of
the
law
you
had
not
virtue
prior
to
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
and
you
have
no
virtues
now
under
the
regime
of
the
false
apostles
we
too
may
say
to
those
who
misname
themselves
evangelical
and
flout
their
liberty
have
you
put
down
the
tyranny
of
the
pope
and
obtained
liberty
in
christ
through
the
anabaptists
and
other
fanatics
or
have
you
obtained
your
freedom
from
us
who
preach
faith
in
christ
jesus
if
there
is
any
honesty
left
in
them
they
will
have
to
confess
that
their
freedom
dates
from
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
verse
even
as
abraham
believed
god
and
it
was
accounted
to
him
for
righteousness
the
apostle
next
adduces
the
example
of
abraham
and
reviews
the
testimony
of
the
scriptures
concerning
faith
the
first
passage
is
taken
from
genesis
and
he
believed
in
the
lord
and
he
counted
it
to
him
for
righteousness
the
apostle
makes
the
most
of
this
passage
abraham
may
have
enjoyed
a
good
standing
with
men
for
his
upright
life
but
not
with
god
in
the
sight
of
god
abraham
was
a
condemned
sinner
that
he
was
justified
before
god
was
not
due
to
his
own
exertions
but
due
to
his
faith
the
scriptures
expressly
state
abraham
believed
in
the
lord
and
he
counted
it
to
him
for
righteousness
paul
places
the
emphasis
upon
the
two
words
abraham
believed
faith
in
god
constitutes
the
highest
worship
the
prime
duty
the
first
obedience
and
the
foremost
sacrifice
without
faith
god
forfeits
his
glory
wisdom
truth
and
mercy
in
us
the
first
duty
of
man
is
to
believe
in
god
and
to
honor
him
with
his
faith
faith
is
truly
the
height
of
wisdom
the
right
kind
of
righteousness
the
only
real
religion
this
will
give
us
an
idea
of
the
excellence
of
faith
to
believe
in
god
as
abraham
did
is
to
be
right
with
god
because
faith
honors
god
faith
says
to
god
i
believe
what
you
say
when
we
pay
attention
to
reason
god
seems
to
propose
impossible
matters
in
the
christian
creed
to
reason
it
seems
absurd
that
christ
should
offer
his
body
and
blood
in
the
lord
supper
that
baptism
should
be
the
washing
of
regeneration
that
the
dead
shall
rise
that
christ
the
son
of
god
was
conceived
in
the
womb
of
the
virgin
mary
etc
reason
shouts
that
all
this
is
preposterous
are
you
surprised
that
reason
thinks
little
of
faith
reason
thinks
it
ludicrous
that
faith
should
be
the
foremost
service
any
person
can
render
unto
god
let
your
faith
supplant
reason
abraham
mastered
reason
by
faith
in
the
word
of
god
not
as
though
reason
ever
yields
meekly
it
put
up
a
fight
against
the
faith
of
abraham
reason
protested
that
it
was
absurd
to
think
that
sarah
who
was
ninety
years
old
and
barren
by
nature
should
give
birth
to
a
son
but
faith
won
the
victory
and
routed
reason
that
ugly
beast
and
enemy
of
god
everyone
who
by
faith
slays
reason
the
world
biggest
monster
renders
god
a
real
service
a
better
service
than
the
religions
of
all
races
and
all
the
drudgery
of
meritorious
monks
can
render
men
fast
pray
watch
suffer
they
intend
to
appease
the
wrath
of
god
and
to
deserve
god
grace
by
their
exertions
but
there
is
no
glory
in
it
for
god
because
by
their
exertions
these
workers
pronounce
god
an
unmerciful
slave
driver
an
unfaithful
and
angry
judge
they
despise
god
make
a
liar
out
of
him
snub
christ
and
all
his
benefits
in
short
they
pull
god
from
his
throne
and
perch
themselves
on
it
faith
truly
honors
god
and
because
faith
honors
god
god
counts
faith
for
righteousness
christian
righteousness
is
the
confidence
of
the
heart
in
god
through
christ
jesus
such
confidence
is
accounted
righteousness
for
sake
two
things
make
for
christian
righteousness
faith
in
christ
which
is
a
gift
of
god
and
god
acceptance
of
this
imperfect
faith
of
ours
for
perfect
righteousness
because
of
my
faith
in
christ
god
overlooks
my
distrust
the
unwillingness
of
my
spirit
my
many
other
sins
because
the
shadow
of
christ
wing
covers
me
i
have
no
fear
that
god
will
cover
all
my
sins
and
take
my
imperfections
for
perfect
righteousness
god
winks
at
my
sins
and
covers
them
up
god
says
because
you
believe
in
my
son
i
will
forgive
your
sins
until
death
shall
deliver
you
from
the
body
of
sin
learn
to
understand
the
constitution
of
your
christian
righteousness
faith
is
weak
but
it
means
enough
to
god
that
he
will
not
lay
sin
to
our
charge
he
will
not
punish
nor
condemn
us
for
it
he
will
forgive
our
sins
as
though
they
amount
to
nothing
at
all
he
will
do
it
not
because
we
are
worthy
of
such
mercy
he
will
do
it
for
jesus
sake
in
whom
we
believe
paradoxically
a
christian
is
both
right
and
wrong
holy
and
profane
an
enemy
of
god
and
a
child
of
god
these
contradictions
no
person
can
harmonize
who
does
not
understand
the
true
way
of
salvation
under
the
papacy
we
were
told
to
toil
until
the
feeling
of
guilt
had
left
us
but
the
authors
of
this
deranged
idea
were
frequently
driven
to
despair
in
the
hour
of
death
it
would
have
happened
to
me
if
christ
had
not
mercifully
delivered
me
from
this
error
we
comfort
the
afflicted
sinner
in
this
manner
brother
you
can
never
be
perfect
in
this
life
but
you
can
be
holy
he
will
say
how
can
i
be
holy
when
i
feel
my
sins
i
answer
you
feel
sin
that
is
a
good
sign
to
realize
that
one
is
ill
is
a
step
and
a
very
necessary
step
toward
recovery
but
how
will
i
get
rid
of
my
sin
he
will
ask
i
answer
see
the
heavenly
physician
christ
who
heals
the
do
not
consult
that
quackdoctor
reason
believe
in
christ
and
your
sins
will
be
pardoned
his
righteousness
will
become
your
righteousness
and
your
sins
will
become
his
sins
on
one
occasion
jesus
said
to
his
disciples
the
father
loveth
you
why
not
because
the
disciples
were
pharisees
or
circumcised
or
particularly
attentive
to
the
law
jesus
said
the
father
loveth
you
because
ye
have
loved
me
and
have
believed
that
i
came
out
from
god
it
pleased
you
to
know
that
the
father
sent
me
into
the
world
and
because
you
believed
it
the
father
loves
you
on
another
occasion
jesus
called
his
disciples
evil
and
commanded
them
to
ask
for
forgiveness
a
christian
is
beloved
of
god
and
a
sinner
how
can
these
two
contradictions
be
harmonized
i
am
a
sinner
and
deserve
god
wrath
and
punishment
and
yet
the
father
loves
me
christ
alone
can
harmonize
these
contradictions
he
is
the
mediator
do
you
now
see
how
faith
justifies
without
works
sin
lingers
in
us
and
god
hates
sin
a
transfusion
of
righteousness
therefore
becomes
vitally
necessary
this
transfusion
of
righteousness
we
obtain
from
christ
because
we
believe
in
him
verse
know
ye
therefore
that
they
which
are
of
faith
the
same
are
the
children
of
abraham
this
is
the
main
point
of
paul
argument
against
the
jews
the
children
of
abraham
are
those
who
believe
and
not
those
who
are
born
of
flesh
and
blood
this
point
paul
drives
home
with
all
his
might
because
the
jews
attached
saving
value
to
the
genealogical
fact
we
are
the
seed
and
children
of
abraham
let
us
begin
with
abraham
and
learn
how
this
friend
of
god
was
justified
and
saved
not
because
he
left
his
country
his
relatives
his
house
not
because
he
was
circumcised
not
because
he
stood
ready
to
sacrifice
his
own
son
isaac
in
whom
he
had
the
promise
of
posterity
abraham
was
justified
because
he
believed
paul
argumentation
runs
like
this
since
this
is
the
unmistakable
testimony
of
holy
writ
why
do
you
take
your
stand
upon
circumcision
and
the
law
was
not
abraham
your
father
of
whom
you
make
so
much
justified
and
saved
without
circumcision
and
the
law
by
faith
alone
paul
therefore
concludes
they
which
are
of
faith
the
same
are
the
children
of
abraham
abraham
was
the
father
of
the
faithful
in
order
to
be
a
child
of
the
believing
abraham
you
must
believe
as
he
did
otherwise
you
are
merely
the
physical
offspring
of
the
procreating
abraham
you
were
conceived
and
born
in
sin
unto
wrath
and
condemnation
ishmael
and
isaac
were
both
the
natural
children
of
abraham
by
rights
ishmael
should
have
enjoyed
the
prerogatives
of
the
firstborn
if
physical
generation
had
any
special
value
nevertheless
he
was
left
out
in
the
cold
while
isaac
was
called
this
goes
to
prove
that
the
children
of
faith
are
the
real
children
of
abraham
some
find
fault
with
paul
for
applying
the
term
faith
in
genesis
to
christ
they
think
paul
use
of
the
term
too
wide
and
general
they
think
its
meaning
should
be
restricted
to
the
context
they
claim
abraham
faith
had
no
more
in
it
than
a
belief
in
the
promise
of
god
that
he
should
have
seed
we
reply
faith
presupposes
the
assurance
of
god
mercy
this
assurance
takes
in
the
confidence
that
our
sins
are
forgiven
for
christ
sake
never
will
the
conscience
trust
in
god
unless
it
can
be
sure
of
mercy
and
promises
in
christ
now
all
the
promises
of
god
lead
back
to
the
first
promise
concerning
christ
and
i
will
put
enmity
between
thee
and
the
woman
and
between
thy
seed
and
her
seed
it
shall
bruise
thy
head
and
thou
shalt
bruise
his
heel
the
faith
of
the
fathers
in
the
old
testament
era
and
our
faith
in
the
new
testament
are
one
and
the
same
faith
in
christ
jesus
although
times
and
conditions
may
differ
peter
acknowledged
this
in
the
words
which
neither
our
fathers
nor
we
were
able
to
bear
but
we
believe
that
through
the
grace
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
we
shall
be
saved
even
as
they
acts
and
paul
writes
and
did
all
drink
the
spiritual
drink
for
they
drank
of
that
spiritual
rock
that
followed
them
and
that
rock
was
christ
i
cor
and
christ
himself
declared
your
father
abraham
rejoiced
to
see
my
day
and
he
saw
it
and
was
glad
john
the
faith
of
the
fathers
was
directed
at
the
christ
who
was
to
come
while
ours
rests
in
the
christ
who
has
come
time
does
not
change
the
object
of
true
faith
or
the
holy
spirit
there
has
always
been
and
always
will
be
one
mind
one
impression
one
faith
concerning
christ
among
true
believers
whether
they
live
in
times
past
now
or
in
times
to
come
we
too
believe
in
the
christ
to
come
as
the
fathers
did
in
the
old
testament
for
we
look
for
christ
to
come
again
on
the
last
day
to
judge
the
quick
and
the
dead
verse
know
ye
therefore
that
they
which
are
of
faith
the
same
are
the
children
of
abraham
paul
is
saying
you
know
from
the
example
of
abraham
and
from
the
plain
testimony
of
the
scriptures
that
they
are
the
children
of
abraham
who
have
faith
in
christ
regardless
of
their
nationality
regardless
of
the
law
regardless
of
works
regardless
of
their
parentage
the
promise
was
made
unto
abraham
shalt
be
a
father
of
many
nations
again
in
thee
shall
all
families
of
the
earth
be
blessed
to
prevent
the
jews
from
misinterpreting
the
word
nations
the
scriptures
are
careful
to
say
many
nations
the
true
children
of
abraham
are
the
believers
in
christ
from
all
nations
verse
and
the
scripture
foreseeing
that
god
would
justify
the
heathen
through
faith
your
boasting
does
not
get
you
anywhere
says
paul
to
the
galatians
because
the
sacred
scriptures
foresaw
and
foretold
long
before
the
law
was
ever
given
that
the
heathen
should
be
justified
by
the
blessed
of
abraham
and
not
by
the
law
this
promise
was
made
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
before
the
law
was
given
because
the
law
was
given
so
many
years
after
abraham
it
could
not
abolish
the
promised
blessing
this
argument
is
strong
because
it
is
based
on
the
exact
factor
of
time
why
should
you
boast
of
the
law
my
galatians
when
the
law
came
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
after
the
promise
the
false
apostles
glorified
the
law
and
despised
the
promise
made
unto
abraham
although
it
antedated
the
law
by
many
years
it
was
after
abraham
was
accounted
righteous
because
of
his
faith
that
the
scriptures
first
make
mention
of
circumcision
the
scriptures
says
paul
meant
to
forestall
your
infatuation
for
the
righteousness
of
the
law
by
installing
the
righteousness
of
faith
before
circumcision
and
the
law
ever
were
ordained
verse
preached
before
the
gospel
unto
abraham
saying
in
thee
shall
all
nations
be
blessed
the
jews
misconstrue
this
passage
they
want
the
term
to
bless
to
mean
to
praise
they
want
the
passage
to
read
in
thee
shall
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
be
praised
but
this
is
a
perversion
of
the
words
of
holy
writ
with
the
words
abraham
believed
paul
describes
a
spiritual
abraham
renewed
by
faith
and
regenerated
by
the
holy
ghost
that
he
should
be
the
spiritual
father
of
many
nations
in
that
way
all
the
gentiles
could
be
given
to
him
for
an
inheritance
the
scriptures
ascribe
no
righteousness
to
abraham
except
through
faith
the
scriptures
speak
of
abraham
as
he
stands
before
god
a
man
justified
by
faith
because
of
his
faith
god
extends
to
him
the
promise
in
thee
shall
all
nations
be
blessed
verse
so
then
they
which
be
of
faith
are
blessed
with
faithful
abraham
the
emphasis
lies
on
the
words
with
faithful
abraham
paul
distinguishes
between
abraham
and
abraham
there
is
a
working
and
there
is
a
believing
abraham
with
the
working
abraham
we
have
nothing
to
do
let
the
jews
glory
in
the
generating
abraham
we
glory
in
the
believing
abraham
of
whom
the
scriptures
say
that
he
received
the
blessing
of
righteousness
by
faith
not
only
for
himself
but
for
all
who
believe
as
he
did
the
world
was
promised
to
abraham
because
he
believed
the
whole
world
is
blessed
if
it
believes
as
abraham
believed
the
blessing
is
the
promise
of
the
gospel
that
all
nations
are
to
be
blessed
means
that
all
nations
are
to
hear
the
gospel
all
nations
are
to
be
declared
righteous
before
god
through
faith
in
christ
jesus
to
bless
simply
means
to
spread
abroad
the
knowledge
of
christ
salvation
this
is
the
office
of
the
new
testament
church
which
distributes
the
promised
blessing
by
preaching
the
gospel
by
administering
the
sacraments
by
comforting
the
in
short
by
dispensing
the
benefits
of
christ
the
jews
exhibited
a
working
abraham
the
pope
exhibits
a
working
christ
or
an
exemplary
christ
the
pope
quotes
christ
saying
recorded
in
john
i
have
given
you
an
example
that
ye
should
do
as
i
have
done
to
you
we
do
not
deny
that
christians
ought
to
imitate
the
example
of
christ
but
mere
imitation
will
not
satisfy
god
and
bear
in
mind
that
paul
is
not
now
discussing
the
example
of
christ
but
the
salvation
of
christ
that
abraham
submitted
to
circumcision
at
the
command
of
god
that
he
was
endowed
with
excellent
virtues
that
he
obeyed
god
in
all
things
was
certainly
admirable
of
him
to
follow
the
example
of
christ
to
love
one
neighbor
to
do
good
to
them
that
persecute
you
to
pray
for
one
enemies
patiently
to
bear
the
ingratitude
of
those
who
return
evil
for
good
is
certainly
praiseworthy
but
praiseworthy
or
not
such
virtues
do
not
acquit
us
before
god
it
takes
more
than
that
to
make
us
righteous
before
god
we
need
christ
himself
not
his
example
to
save
us
we
need
a
redeeming
not
an
exemplary
christ
to
save
us
paul
is
here
speaking
of
the
redeeming
christ
and
the
believing
abraham
not
of
the
model
christ
or
the
sweating
abraham
the
believing
abraham
is
not
to
lie
buried
in
the
grave
he
is
to
be
dusted
off
and
brought
out
before
the
world
he
is
to
be
praised
to
the
sky
for
his
faith
heaven
and
earth
ought
to
know
about
him
and
about
his
faith
in
christ
the
working
abraham
ought
to
look
pretty
small
next
to
the
believing
abraham
paul
words
contain
the
implication
of
contrast
when
he
quotes
scripture
to
the
effect
that
all
nations
that
share
the
faith
of
faithful
abraham
are
to
be
blessed
paul
means
to
imply
the
contrast
that
all
nations
are
accursed
without
faith
in
christ
verse
for
as
many
as
are
of
the
works
of
the
law
are
under
the
curse
the
curse
of
god
is
like
a
flood
that
swallows
everything
that
is
not
of
faith
to
avoid
the
curse
we
must
hold
on
to
the
promise
of
the
blessing
in
christ
the
reader
is
reminded
that
all
this
has
no
bearing
upon
civil
laws
customs
or
political
matters
civil
laws
and
ordinances
have
their
place
and
purpose
let
every
government
enact
the
best
possible
laws
but
civil
righteousness
will
never
deliver
a
person
from
the
condemnation
of
god
law
i
have
good
reason
for
calling
your
attention
to
this
people
easily
mistake
civil
righteousness
for
spiritual
righteousness
in
civil
life
we
must
of
course
pay
attention
to
laws
and
deeds
but
in
the
spiritual
life
we
must
not
think
to
be
justified
by
laws
and
works
but
always
keep
in
mind
the
promise
and
blessing
of
christ
our
only
savior
according
to
paul
everything
that
is
not
of
faith
is
sin
when
our
opponents
hear
us
repeat
this
statement
of
paul
they
make
it
appear
as
if
we
taught
that
governments
should
not
be
honored
as
if
we
favored
rebellion
against
the
constituted
authorities
as
if
we
condemned
all
laws
our
opponents
do
us
a
great
wrong
for
we
make
a
distinction
between
civil
and
spiritual
affairs
governmental
laws
and
ordinances
are
blessings
of
god
for
this
life
only
as
for
everlasting
life
temporal
blessings
are
not
good
enough
unbelievers
enjoy
more
temporal
blessings
than
the
christians
civil
or
legal
righteousness
may
be
good
enough
for
this
life
but
not
for
the
life
hereafter
otherwise
the
infidels
would
be
nearer
heaven
than
the
christians
for
infidels
often
excel
in
civil
righteousness
verse
for
it
is
written
cursed
is
every
one
that
continueth
not
in
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
to
do
them
paul
goes
on
to
prove
from
this
quotation
out
of
the
book
of
deuteronomy
that
all
men
who
are
under
the
law
are
under
the
sentence
of
sin
of
the
wrath
of
god
and
of
everlasting
death
paul
produces
his
proof
in
a
roundabout
way
he
turns
the
negative
statement
cursed
is
every
one
that
continueth
not
in
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
to
do
them
into
a
positive
statement
as
many
as
are
of
the
works
of
the
law
are
under
the
curse
these
two
statements
one
by
paul
and
the
other
by
moses
appear
to
conflict
paul
declares
whosoever
shall
do
the
works
of
the
law
is
accursed
moses
declares
whosoever
shall
not
do
the
works
of
the
law
is
accursed
how
can
these
two
contradictory
statements
be
reconciled
how
can
the
one
statement
prove
the
other
no
person
can
hope
to
understand
paul
unless
he
understands
the
article
of
justification
these
two
statements
are
not
at
all
inconsistent
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
to
do
the
works
of
the
law
does
not
mean
only
to
live
up
to
the
superficial
requirements
of
the
law
but
to
obey
the
spirit
of
the
law
to
perfection
but
where
will
you
find
the
person
who
can
do
that
let
him
step
forward
and
we
will
praise
him
our
opponents
have
their
answer
they
quote
paul
own
statement
in
romans
the
doers
of
the
law
shall
be
justified
very
well
but
let
us
first
find
out
who
the
doers
of
the
law
are
they
call
a
doer
of
the
law
one
who
performs
the
law
in
its
literal
sense
this
is
not
to
do
the
law
this
is
to
sin
when
our
opponents
go
about
to
perform
the
law
they
sin
against
the
first
the
second
and
the
third
commandments
in
fact
they
sin
against
the
whole
law
for
god
requires
above
all
that
we
worship
him
in
spirit
and
in
faith
in
observing
the
law
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
righteousness
without
faith
in
christ
these
go
smack
against
the
law
and
against
god
they
deny
the
righteousness
of
god
his
mercy
and
his
promises
they
deny
christ
and
all
his
benefits
in
their
ignorance
of
the
true
purpose
of
the
law
the
exponents
of
the
law
abuse
the
law
as
paul
says
romans
for
they
being
ignorant
of
god
righteousness
and
going
about
to
establish
their
own
righteousness
have
not
submitted
themselves
unto
the
righteousness
of
god
in
their
folly
our
opponents
rush
into
the
scriptures
pick
out
a
sentence
here
and
a
sentence
there
about
the
law
and
imagine
they
know
all
about
it
their
is
plain
idolatry
and
blasphemy
against
god
no
wonder
they
abide
under
the
curse
of
god
because
god
saw
that
we
could
not
fulfill
the
law
he
provided
a
way
of
salvation
long
before
the
law
was
ever
given
a
salvation
that
he
promised
to
abraham
saying
in
thee
shall
all
nations
be
blessed
the
very
first
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
believe
in
christ
first
we
must
receive
the
holy
spirit
who
enlightens
and
sanctifies
us
so
that
we
can
begin
to
do
the
law
to
love
god
and
our
neighbor
now
the
holy
ghost
is
not
obtained
by
the
law
but
by
faith
in
christ
in
the
last
analysis
to
do
the
law
means
to
believe
in
jesus
christ
the
tree
comes
first
and
then
come
the
fruits
the
scholastics
admit
that
a
mere
external
and
superficial
performance
of
the
law
without
sincerity
and
good
will
is
plain
hypocrisy
judas
acted
like
the
other
disciples
what
was
wrong
with
judas
mark
what
rome
answers
judas
was
a
reprobate
his
motives
were
perverse
therefore
his
works
were
hypocritical
and
no
good
well
well
rome
does
admit
after
all
that
works
in
themselves
do
not
justify
unless
they
issue
from
a
sincere
heart
why
do
our
opponents
not
profess
the
same
truth
in
spiritual
matters
there
above
all
faith
must
precede
everything
the
heart
must
be
purified
by
faith
before
a
person
can
lift
a
finger
to
please
god
there
are
two
classes
of
doers
of
the
law
true
doers
and
hypocritical
doers
the
true
doers
of
the
law
are
those
who
are
moved
by
faith
in
christ
to
do
the
law
the
hypocritical
doers
of
the
law
are
those
who
seek
to
obtain
righteousness
by
a
mechanical
performance
of
good
works
while
their
hearts
are
far
removed
from
god
they
act
like
the
foolish
carpenter
who
starts
with
the
roof
when
he
builds
a
house
instead
of
doing
the
law
these
hypocrites
break
the
law
they
break
the
very
first
commandment
of
god
by
denying
his
promise
in
christ
they
do
not
worship
god
in
faith
they
worship
themselves
no
wonder
paul
was
able
to
foretell
the
abominations
that
antichrist
would
bring
into
the
church
that
antichrists
would
come
christ
himself
prophesied
matthew
for
many
shall
come
in
my
name
saying
i
am
christ
and
shall
deceive
many
whoever
seeks
righteousness
by
works
denies
god
and
makes
himself
god
he
is
an
antichrist
because
he
ascribes
to
his
own
works
the
omnipotent
capability
of
conquering
sin
death
devil
hell
and
the
wrath
of
god
an
antichrist
lays
claim
to
the
honor
of
christ
he
is
an
idolater
of
himself
the
person
is
the
worst
kind
of
infidel
those
who
intend
to
obtain
righteousness
by
their
own
efforts
do
not
say
in
so
many
words
i
am
god
i
am
christ
but
it
amounts
to
that
they
usurp
the
divinity
and
office
of
christ
the
effect
is
the
same
as
if
they
said
i
am
christ
i
am
a
savior
i
save
myself
and
others
this
is
the
impression
the
monks
give
out
the
pope
is
the
antichrist
because
he
is
against
christ
because
he
takes
liberties
with
the
things
of
god
because
he
lords
it
over
the
temple
of
god
i
can
not
tell
you
in
words
how
criminal
it
is
to
seek
righteousness
before
god
without
faith
in
christ
by
the
works
of
the
law
it
is
the
abomination
standing
in
the
holy
place
it
deposes
the
creator
and
deifies
the
creature
the
real
doers
of
the
law
are
the
true
believers
the
holy
spirit
enables
them
to
love
god
and
their
neighbor
but
because
we
have
only
the
of
the
spirit
and
not
the
we
do
not
observe
the
law
perfectly
this
imperfection
of
ours
however
is
not
imputed
to
us
for
christ
sake
hence
the
statement
of
moses
cursed
is
every
one
that
continueth
not
in
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
to
do
them
is
not
contrary
to
paul
moses
requires
perfect
doers
of
the
law
but
where
will
you
find
them
nowhere
moses
himself
confessed
that
he
was
not
a
perfect
doer
of
the
law
he
said
to
the
lord
pardon
our
iniquity
and
our
sin
christ
alone
can
make
us
innocent
of
any
transgression
how
so
first
by
the
forgiveness
of
our
sins
and
the
imputation
of
his
righteousness
secondly
by
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
who
engenders
new
life
and
activity
in
us
objections
to
the
doctrine
of
faith
disproved
here
we
shall
take
the
time
to
enter
upon
the
objections
which
our
opponents
raise
against
the
doctrine
of
faith
there
are
many
passages
in
the
bible
that
deal
with
works
and
the
reward
of
works
which
our
opponents
cite
against
us
in
the
belief
that
these
will
disprove
the
doctrine
of
faith
which
we
teach
the
scholastics
grant
that
according
to
the
reasonable
order
of
nature
being
precedes
doing
they
grant
that
any
act
is
faulty
unless
it
proceeds
from
a
right
motive
they
grant
that
a
person
must
be
right
before
he
can
do
right
why
do
they
grant
that
the
right
inclination
of
the
heart
toward
god
through
faith
in
christ
must
precede
works
in
the
eleventh
chapter
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
we
find
a
catalogue
of
various
works
and
deeds
of
the
saints
of
the
bible
david
who
killed
a
lion
and
a
bear
and
defeated
goliath
is
mentioned
in
the
heroic
deeds
of
david
the
scholastic
can
discover
nothing
more
than
outward
achievement
but
the
deeds
of
david
must
be
evaluated
according
to
the
personality
of
david
when
we
understand
that
david
was
a
man
of
faith
whose
heart
trusted
in
the
lord
we
shall
understand
why
he
could
do
such
heroic
deeds
david
said
the
lord
that
delivered
me
out
of
the
paw
of
the
lion
and
out
of
the
paw
of
the
bear
he
will
deliver
me
out
of
the
hand
of
this
philistine
again
thou
comest
to
me
with
a
sword
and
with
a
spear
and
with
a
shield
but
i
come
to
thee
in
the
name
of
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
the
armies
of
israel
whom
thou
hast
defied
this
day
will
the
lord
deliver
thee
into
mine
hand
and
i
will
smite
thee
and
take
thine
head
from
thee
i
samuel
before
david
could
achieve
a
single
heroic
deed
he
was
already
a
man
beloved
of
god
strong
and
constant
in
faith
of
abel
it
is
said
in
the
same
epistle
by
faith
abel
offered
unto
god
a
more
excellent
sacrifice
than
cain
when
the
scholastics
come
upon
the
parallel
passage
in
genesis
they
get
no
further
than
the
words
and
the
lord
had
respect
unto
abel
and
to
his
offering
aha
they
cry
see
god
has
respect
to
offerings
works
do
justify
with
mud
in
their
eyes
they
can
not
see
that
the
text
says
in
genesis
that
the
lord
had
respect
to
the
person
of
abel
first
abel
pleased
the
lord
because
of
his
faith
because
the
person
of
abel
pleased
the
lord
the
offering
of
abel
pleased
the
lord
also
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
expressly
states
by
faith
abel
offered
unto
god
a
more
excellent
sacrifice
in
our
dealings
with
god
the
work
is
worth
nothing
without
faith
for
without
faith
it
is
impossible
to
please
him
hebrews
the
sacrifice
of
abel
was
better
than
the
sacrifice
of
cain
because
abel
had
faith
as
to
cain
he
had
no
faith
or
trust
in
god
grace
but
strutted
about
in
his
own
fancied
worth
when
god
refused
to
recognize
cain
worth
cain
got
angry
at
god
and
at
abel
the
holy
spirit
speaks
of
faith
in
different
ways
in
the
sacred
scriptures
sometimes
he
speaks
of
faith
independently
of
other
matters
when
the
scriptures
speak
of
faith
in
the
absolute
or
abstract
faith
refers
to
justification
directly
but
when
the
scripture
speaks
of
rewards
and
works
it
speaks
of
compound
or
relative
faith
we
will
furnish
some
examples
galatians
faith
which
worketh
by
love
leviticus
which
if
a
man
do
he
shall
live
in
them
matthew
if
thou
wilt
enter
into
life
keep
the
commandments
psalm
depart
from
evil
and
do
good
in
these
and
other
passages
where
mention
is
made
of
doing
the
scriptures
always
speak
of
a
faithful
doing
a
doing
inspired
by
faith
do
this
and
thou
shalt
live
means
first
have
faith
in
christ
and
christ
will
enable
you
to
do
and
to
live
in
the
word
of
god
all
things
that
are
attributed
to
works
are
attributable
to
faith
faith
is
the
divinity
of
works
faith
permeates
all
the
deeds
of
the
believer
as
christ
divinity
permeated
his
humanity
abraham
was
accounted
righteous
because
faith
pervaded
his
whole
personality
and
his
every
action
when
you
read
how
the
fathers
prophets
and
kings
accomplished
great
deeds
remember
to
explain
them
as
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
accounts
for
them
who
through
faith
subdued
kingdoms
wrought
righteousness
obtained
promises
stopped
the
mouths
of
lions
hebrews
in
this
way
will
we
correctly
interpret
all
those
passages
that
seem
to
support
the
righteousness
of
works
the
law
is
truly
observed
only
through
faith
hence
every
holy
moral
is
accursed
supposing
that
this
explanation
will
not
satisfy
the
scholastics
supposing
that
they
should
completely
wrap
me
up
in
their
arguments
they
can
not
do
it
i
would
rather
be
wrong
and
give
all
credit
to
christ
alone
here
is
christ
paul
christ
apostle
declares
that
christ
hath
redeemed
us
from
the
curse
of
the
law
being
made
a
curse
for
us
gal
i
hear
with
my
own
ears
that
i
can
not
be
saved
except
by
the
blood
and
death
of
christ
i
conclude
therefore
that
it
is
up
to
christ
to
overcome
my
sins
and
not
up
to
the
law
or
my
own
efforts
if
he
is
the
price
of
my
redemption
if
he
was
made
sin
for
my
justification
i
do
give
a
care
if
you
quote
me
a
thousand
scripture
passages
for
the
righteousness
of
works
against
the
righteousness
of
faith
i
have
the
author
and
lord
of
the
scriptures
on
my
side
i
would
rather
believe
him
than
all
that
riffraff
of
pious
verse
but
that
no
man
is
justified
by
the
law
in
the
sight
of
god
it
is
evident
for
the
just
shall
live
by
faith
the
apostle
draws
into
his
argument
the
testimony
of
the
prophet
habakkuk
the
just
shall
live
by
his
faith
this
passage
carries
much
weight
because
it
eliminates
the
law
and
the
deeds
of
the
law
as
factors
in
the
process
of
our
justification
the
scholastics
misconstrue
this
passage
by
saying
the
just
shall
live
by
faith
if
it
is
a
working
faith
or
a
faith
formed
and
performed
by
charitable
works
their
annotation
is
a
forgery
to
speak
of
formed
or
unformed
faith
a
sort
of
double
faith
is
contrary
to
the
scriptures
if
charitable
works
can
form
and
perfect
faith
i
am
forced
to
say
eventually
that
charitable
deeds
constitute
the
essential
factor
in
the
christian
religion
christ
and
his
benefits
would
be
lost
to
us
verse
and
the
law
is
not
of
faith
in
direct
opposition
to
the
scholastics
paul
declares
the
law
is
not
of
faith
what
is
this
charity
the
scholastics
talk
so
much
about
does
not
the
law
command
charity
the
fact
is
the
law
commands
nothing
but
charity
as
we
may
gather
from
the
following
scripture
passages
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thine
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
and
with
all
thy
might
deut
strewing
mercy
unto
thousands
of
them
that
love
me
and
keep
my
commandments
exodus
on
these
two
commandments
hang
all
the
law
and
the
prophets
matt
if
the
law
requires
charity
charity
is
part
of
the
law
and
not
of
faith
since
christ
has
displaced
the
law
which
commands
charity
it
follows
that
charity
has
been
abrogated
with
the
law
as
a
factor
in
our
justification
and
only
faith
is
left
verse
but
the
man
that
doeth
them
shall
live
in
them
paul
undertakes
to
explain
the
difference
between
the
righteousness
of
the
law
and
the
righteousness
of
faith
the
righteousness
of
the
law
is
the
fulfillment
of
the
law
according
to
the
passage
the
man
that
doeth
them
shall
live
in
them
the
righteousness
of
faith
is
to
believe
the
gospel
according
to
the
passage
the
just
shall
live
by
faith
the
law
is
a
statement
of
debit
the
gospel
a
statement
of
credit
by
this
distinction
paul
explains
why
charity
which
is
the
commandment
of
the
law
can
not
justify
because
the
law
contributes
nothing
to
our
justification
indeed
works
do
follow
after
faith
but
faith
is
not
therefore
a
meritorious
work
faith
is
a
gift
the
character
and
limitations
of
the
law
must
be
rigidly
maintained
when
we
believe
in
christ
we
live
by
faith
when
we
believe
in
the
law
we
may
be
active
enough
but
we
have
no
life
the
function
of
the
law
is
not
to
give
life
the
function
of
the
law
is
to
kill
true
the
law
says
the
man
that
doeth
them
shall
live
in
them
but
where
is
the
person
who
can
do
them
love
god
with
all
his
heart
soul
and
mind
and
his
neighbor
as
himself
paul
has
nothing
against
those
who
are
justified
by
faith
and
therefore
are
true
doers
of
the
law
he
opposes
those
who
think
they
can
fulfill
the
law
when
in
reality
they
can
only
sin
against
the
law
by
trying
to
obtain
righteousness
by
the
law
the
law
demands
that
we
fear
love
and
worship
god
with
a
true
faith
the
fail
to
do
this
instead
they
invent
new
modes
of
worship
and
new
kinds
of
works
which
god
never
commanded
they
provoke
his
anger
according
to
the
passage
but
in
vain
they
do
worship
me
teaching
for
doctrines
the
commandments
of
men
matthew
hence
the
workers
are
downright
rebels
against
god
and
idolaters
who
constantly
sin
against
the
first
commandment
in
short
they
are
no
good
though
outwardly
they
seem
to
be
extremely
solicitous
of
the
honor
of
god
we
who
are
justified
by
faith
as
the
saints
of
old
may
be
under
the
law
but
we
are
not
under
the
curse
of
the
law
because
sin
is
not
imputed
to
us
for
christ
sake
if
the
law
can
not
be
fulfilled
by
the
believers
if
sin
continues
to
cling
to
them
despite
their
love
for
god
what
can
you
expect
of
people
who
are
not
yet
justified
by
faith
who
are
still
enemies
of
god
and
his
word
like
the
unbelieving
it
goes
to
show
how
impossible
it
is
for
those
who
have
not
been
justified
by
faith
to
fulfill
the
law
verse
christ
hath
redeemed
us
from
the
curse
of
the
law
being
made
a
curse
for
us
for
it
is
written
cursed
is
every
one
that
hangeth
on
a
tree
jerome
and
his
followers
rack
their
miserable
brains
over
this
comforting
passage
in
an
effort
to
save
christ
from
the
fancied
insult
of
being
called
a
curse
they
say
this
quotation
from
moses
does
not
apply
to
christ
paul
is
taking
liberties
with
moses
by
generalizing
the
statements
in
deuteronomy
moses
has
that
is
hanged
paul
puts
it
one
that
hangeth
on
the
other
hand
paul
omits
the
words
god
in
his
quotation
from
moses
he
that
is
hanged
is
accursed
of
god
moses
speaks
of
a
criminal
who
is
worthy
of
death
how
our
opponents
ask
can
this
passage
be
applied
to
the
holy
christ
as
if
he
were
accursed
of
god
and
worthy
to
be
hanged
this
piece
of
exegesis
may
impress
the
naive
as
a
zealous
attempt
to
defend
the
honor
and
glory
of
christ
let
us
see
what
paul
has
in
mind
paul
does
not
say
that
christ
was
made
a
curse
for
himself
the
accent
is
on
the
two
words
for
us
christ
is
personally
innocent
personally
he
did
not
deserve
to
be
hanged
for
any
crime
of
his
own
doing
but
because
christ
took
the
place
of
others
who
were
sinners
he
was
hanged
like
any
other
transgressor
the
law
of
moses
leaves
no
loopholes
it
says
that
a
transgressor
should
be
hanged
who
are
the
other
sinners
we
are
the
sentence
of
death
and
everlasting
damnation
had
long
been
pronounced
over
us
but
christ
took
all
our
sins
and
died
for
them
on
the
cross
he
was
numbered
with
the
transgressors
and
he
bare
the
sin
of
many
and
made
intercession
for
the
transgressors
isaiah
all
the
prophets
of
old
said
that
christ
should
be
the
greatest
transgressor
murderer
adulterer
thief
blasphemer
that
ever
was
or
ever
could
be
on
earth
when
he
took
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
upon
himself
christ
was
no
longer
an
innocent
person
he
was
a
sinner
burdened
with
the
sins
of
a
paul
who
was
a
blasphemer
burdened
with
the
sins
of
a
peter
who
denied
christ
burdened
with
the
sins
of
a
david
who
committed
adultery
and
murder
and
gave
the
heathen
occasion
to
laugh
at
the
lord
in
short
christ
was
charged
with
the
sins
of
all
men
that
he
should
pay
for
them
with
his
own
blood
the
curse
struck
him
the
law
found
him
among
sinners
he
was
not
only
in
the
company
of
sinners
he
had
gone
so
far
as
to
invest
himself
with
the
flesh
and
blood
of
sinners
so
the
law
judged
and
hanged
him
for
a
sinner
in
separating
christ
from
us
sinners
and
holding
him
up
as
a
holy
exemplar
errorists
rob
us
of
our
best
comfort
they
misrepresent
him
as
a
threatening
tyrant
who
is
ready
to
slaughter
us
at
the
slightest
provocation
i
am
told
that
it
is
preposterous
and
wicked
to
call
the
son
of
god
a
cursed
sinner
i
answer
if
you
deny
that
he
is
a
condemned
sinner
you
are
forced
to
deny
that
christ
died
it
is
not
less
preposterous
to
say
the
son
of
god
died
than
to
say
the
son
of
god
was
a
sinner
john
the
baptist
called
him
the
lamb
of
god
which
taketh
away
the
sin
of
the
world
being
the
unspotted
lamb
of
god
christ
was
personally
innocent
but
because
he
took
the
sins
of
the
world
his
sinlessness
was
defiled
with
the
sinfulness
of
the
world
whatever
sins
i
you
all
of
us
have
committed
or
shall
commit
they
are
christ
sins
as
if
he
had
committed
them
himself
our
sins
have
to
be
christ
sins
or
we
shall
perish
forever
isaiah
declares
of
christ
the
lord
hath
laid
on
him
the
iniquity
of
us
all
we
have
no
right
to
minimize
the
force
of
this
declaration
god
does
not
amuse
himself
with
words
what
a
relief
for
a
christian
to
know
that
christ
is
covered
all
over
with
my
sins
your
sins
and
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
the
papists
invented
their
own
doctrine
of
faith
they
say
charity
creates
and
adorns
their
faith
by
stripping
christ
of
our
sins
by
making
him
sinless
they
cast
our
sins
back
at
us
and
make
christ
absolutely
worthless
to
us
what
sort
of
charity
is
this
if
that
is
a
sample
of
their
vaunted
charity
we
want
none
of
it
our
merciful
father
in
heaven
saw
how
the
law
oppressed
us
and
how
impossible
it
was
for
us
to
get
out
from
under
the
curse
of
the
law
he
therefore
sent
his
only
son
into
the
world
and
said
to
him
you
are
now
peter
the
liar
paul
the
persecutor
david
the
adulterer
adam
the
disobedient
the
thief
on
the
cross
you
my
son
must
pay
the
iniquity
the
law
growls
all
right
if
your
son
is
taking
the
sin
of
the
world
i
see
no
sins
anywhere
else
but
in
him
he
shall
die
on
the
cross
and
the
law
kills
christ
but
we
go
free
the
argument
of
the
apostle
against
the
righteousness
of
the
law
is
impregnable
if
christ
bears
our
sins
we
do
not
bear
them
but
if
christ
is
innocent
of
our
sins
and
does
not
bear
them
we
must
bear
them
and
we
shall
die
in
our
sins
but
thanks
be
to
god
which
giveth
us
the
victory
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
let
us
see
how
christ
was
able
to
gain
the
victory
over
our
enemies
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
past
present
and
future
fastened
themselves
upon
christ
and
condemned
him
but
because
christ
is
god
he
had
an
everlasting
and
unconquerable
righteousness
these
two
the
sin
of
the
world
and
the
righteousness
of
god
met
in
a
death
struggle
furiously
the
sin
of
the
world
assailed
the
righteousness
of
god
righteousness
is
immortal
and
invincible
on
the
other
hand
sin
is
a
mighty
tyrant
who
subdues
all
men
this
tyrant
pounces
on
christ
but
righteousness
is
unconquerable
the
result
is
inevitable
sin
is
defeated
and
righteousness
triumphs
and
reigns
forever
in
the
same
manner
was
death
defeated
death
is
emperor
of
the
world
he
strikes
down
kings
princes
all
men
he
has
an
idea
to
destroy
all
life
but
christ
has
immortal
life
and
life
immortal
gained
the
victory
over
death
through
christ
death
has
lost
her
sting
christ
is
the
death
of
death
the
curse
of
god
waged
a
similar
battle
with
the
eternal
mercy
of
god
in
christ
the
curse
meant
to
condemn
god
mercy
but
it
could
not
do
it
because
the
mercy
of
god
is
everlasting
the
curse
had
to
give
way
if
the
mercy
of
god
in
christ
had
lost
out
god
himself
would
have
lost
out
which
of
course
is
impossible
christ
says
paul
spoiled
principalities
and
powers
he
made
a
show
of
them
openly
triumphing
over
them
in
it
col
they
can
not
harm
those
who
hide
in
christ
sin
death
the
wrath
of
god
hell
the
devil
are
mortified
in
christ
where
christ
is
near
the
powers
of
evil
must
keep
their
distance
john
says
and
this
is
the
victory
that
overcometh
the
world
even
our
faith
i
john
you
may
now
perceive
why
it
is
imperative
to
believe
and
confess
the
divinity
of
christ
to
overcome
the
sin
of
a
whole
world
and
death
and
the
wrath
of
god
was
no
work
for
any
creature
the
power
of
sin
and
death
could
be
broken
only
by
a
greater
power
god
alone
could
abolish
sin
destroy
death
and
take
away
the
curse
of
the
law
god
alone
could
bring
righteousness
life
and
mercy
to
light
in
attributing
these
achievements
to
christ
the
scriptures
pronounce
christ
to
be
god
forever
the
article
of
justification
is
indeed
fundamental
if
we
remain
sound
in
this
one
article
we
remain
sound
in
all
the
other
articles
of
the
christian
faith
when
we
teach
justification
by
faith
in
christ
we
confess
at
the
same
time
that
christ
is
god
i
can
not
get
over
the
blindness
of
the
pope
theologians
to
imagine
that
the
mighty
forces
of
sin
death
and
the
curse
can
be
vanquished
by
the
righteousness
of
man
paltry
works
by
fasting
pilgrimages
masses
vows
and
such
gewgaws
these
blind
leaders
of
the
blind
turn
the
poor
people
over
to
the
mercy
of
sin
death
and
the
devil
what
chance
has
a
defenseless
human
creature
against
these
powers
of
darkness
they
train
sinners
who
are
ten
times
worse
than
any
thief
whore
murderer
the
divine
power
of
god
alone
can
destroy
sin
and
death
and
create
righteousness
and
life
when
we
hear
that
christ
was
made
a
curse
for
us
let
us
believe
it
with
joy
and
assurance
by
faith
christ
changes
places
with
us
he
gets
our
sins
we
get
his
holiness
by
faith
alone
can
we
become
righteous
for
faith
invests
us
with
the
sinlessness
of
christ
the
more
fully
we
believe
this
the
fuller
will
be
our
joy
if
you
believe
that
sin
death
and
the
curse
are
void
why
they
are
null
zero
whenever
sin
and
death
make
you
nervous
write
it
down
as
an
illusion
of
the
devil
there
is
no
sin
now
no
curse
no
death
no
devil
because
christ
has
done
away
with
them
this
fact
is
sure
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
fact
the
defect
lies
in
our
lack
of
faith
in
the
apostolic
creed
we
confess
i
believe
in
the
holy
christian
church
that
means
i
believe
that
there
is
no
sin
no
curse
no
evil
in
the
church
of
god
faith
says
i
believe
that
but
if
you
want
to
believe
your
eyes
you
will
find
many
shortcomings
and
offenses
in
the
members
of
the
holy
church
you
see
them
succumb
to
temptation
you
see
them
weak
in
faith
you
see
them
giving
way
to
anger
envy
and
other
evil
dispositions
how
can
the
church
be
holy
you
ask
it
is
with
the
christian
church
as
it
is
with
the
individual
christian
if
i
examine
myself
i
find
enough
unholiness
to
shock
me
but
when
i
look
at
christ
in
me
i
find
that
i
am
altogether
holy
and
so
it
is
with
the
church
holy
writ
does
not
say
that
christ
was
under
the
curse
it
says
directly
that
christ
was
made
a
curse
in
ii
corinthians
paul
writes
for
he
god
hath
made
him
christ
to
be
sin
for
us
who
knew
no
sin
that
we
might
be
made
the
righteousness
of
god
in
him
although
this
and
similar
passages
may
be
properly
explained
by
saying
that
christ
was
made
a
sacrifice
for
the
curse
and
for
sin
yet
in
my
judgment
it
is
better
to
leave
these
passages
stand
as
they
read
christ
was
made
sin
itself
christ
was
made
the
curse
itself
when
a
sinner
gets
wise
to
himself
he
does
not
only
feel
miserable
he
feels
like
misery
personified
he
does
not
only
feel
like
a
sinner
he
feels
like
sin
itself
to
finish
with
this
verse
all
evils
would
have
overwhelmed
us
as
they
shall
overwhelm
the
unbelievers
forever
if
christ
had
not
become
the
great
transgressor
and
guilty
bearer
of
all
our
sins
the
sins
of
the
world
got
him
down
for
a
moment
they
came
around
him
like
water
of
christ
the
old
testament
prophet
complained
thy
fierce
wrath
goeth
over
me
thy
terrors
have
cut
me
off
psalm
by
salvation
we
have
been
delivered
from
the
terrors
of
god
to
a
life
of
eternal
felicity
verse
that
the
blessing
of
abraham
might
come
on
the
gentiles
through
jesus
christ
paul
always
keeps
this
text
before
him
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
be
blessed
the
blessing
promised
unto
abraham
could
come
upon
the
gentiles
only
by
christ
the
seed
of
abraham
to
become
a
blessing
unto
all
nations
christ
had
to
be
made
a
curse
to
take
away
the
curse
from
the
nations
of
the
earth
the
merit
that
we
plead
and
the
work
that
we
proffer
is
christ
who
was
made
a
curse
for
us
let
us
become
expert
in
the
art
of
transferring
our
sins
our
death
and
every
evil
from
ourselves
to
christ
and
christ
righteousness
and
blessing
from
christ
to
ourselves
verse
that
we
might
receive
the
promise
of
the
spirit
through
faith
the
promise
of
the
spirit
is
hebrew
for
the
promised
spirit
the
spirit
spells
freedom
from
the
law
sin
death
the
curse
hell
and
the
judgment
of
god
no
merits
are
mentioned
in
connection
with
this
promise
of
the
spirit
and
all
the
blessings
that
go
with
him
this
spirit
of
many
blessings
is
received
by
faith
alone
faith
alone
builds
on
the
promises
of
god
as
paul
says
in
this
verse
long
ago
the
prophets
visualized
the
happy
changes
christ
would
effect
in
all
things
despite
the
fact
that
the
jews
had
the
law
of
god
they
never
ceased
to
look
longingly
for
christ
after
moses
no
prophet
or
king
added
a
single
law
to
the
book
any
changes
or
additions
were
deferred
to
the
time
of
christ
coming
moses
told
the
people
the
lord
thy
god
will
raise
up
unto
thee
a
prophet
from
the
midst
of
thee
of
thy
brethren
like
unto
me
unto
him
ye
shall
hearken
deut
god
people
of
old
felt
that
the
law
of
moses
could
not
be
improved
upon
until
the
messiah
would
bring
better
things
than
the
law
grace
and
remission
of
sins
verse
brethren
i
speak
after
the
manner
of
men
though
it
be
but
a
man
covenant
yet
if
it
be
confirmed
no
man
disannulleth
or
addeth
thereto
after
the
preceding
argument
paul
offers
another
based
on
the
similarity
between
a
man
testament
and
god
testament
a
testament
seems
too
weak
a
premise
for
the
apostle
to
argue
from
in
confirmation
of
so
important
a
matter
as
justification
we
ought
to
prove
earthly
things
by
heavenly
things
and
not
heavenly
things
by
earthly
things
but
where
the
earthly
thing
is
an
ordinance
of
god
we
may
use
it
to
prove
divine
matters
in
matthew
christ
himself
argued
from
earthly
to
heavenly
things
when
he
said
if
ye
then
being
evil
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
to
your
children
how
much
more
shall
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
give
good
things
to
them
that
ask
him
to
come
to
paul
argument
civil
law
which
is
god
ordinance
prohibits
tampering
with
any
testament
of
man
any
person
last
will
and
testament
must
be
respected
paul
asks
why
is
it
that
man
last
will
is
scrupulously
respected
and
not
god
testament
you
would
not
think
of
breaking
faith
with
a
man
testament
why
do
you
not
keep
faith
with
god
testament
the
apostle
says
that
he
is
speaking
after
the
manner
of
men
he
means
to
say
i
will
give
you
an
illustration
from
the
customs
of
men
if
a
man
last
will
is
respected
and
it
is
how
much
more
ought
the
testament
of
god
be
honored
thy
seed
shall
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
be
blessed
when
christ
died
this
testament
was
sealed
by
his
blood
after
his
death
the
testament
was
opened
it
was
published
to
the
nations
no
man
ought
to
alter
god
testament
as
the
false
apostles
do
who
substitute
the
law
and
traditions
of
men
for
the
testament
of
god
as
the
false
prophets
tampered
with
god
testament
in
the
days
of
paul
so
many
do
in
our
day
they
will
observe
human
laws
punctiliously
but
the
laws
of
god
they
transgress
without
the
flicker
of
an
eyelid
but
the
time
will
come
when
they
will
find
out
that
it
is
no
joke
to
pervert
the
testament
of
god
verse
now
to
abraham
and
his
seed
were
the
promises
made
he
saith
not
and
to
seeds
as
of
many
but
as
of
one
and
to
thy
seed
which
is
christ
the
word
testament
is
another
name
for
the
promise
that
god
made
unto
abraham
concerning
christ
a
testament
is
not
a
law
but
an
inheritance
heirs
do
not
look
for
laws
and
assessments
when
they
open
a
last
will
they
look
for
grants
and
favors
the
testament
which
god
made
out
to
abraham
did
not
contain
laws
it
contained
promises
of
great
spiritual
blessings
the
promises
were
made
in
view
of
christ
in
one
seed
not
in
many
seeds
the
jews
will
not
accept
this
interpretation
they
insist
that
the
singular
seed
is
put
for
the
plural
seeds
we
prefer
the
interpretation
of
paul
who
makes
a
fine
case
for
christ
and
for
us
out
of
the
singular
seed
and
is
after
all
inspired
to
do
so
by
the
holy
ghost
verse
and
this
i
say
that
the
covenant
that
was
confirmed
before
of
god
in
christ
the
law
which
was
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
after
can
not
disannul
that
it
should
make
the
promise
of
none
effect
the
jews
assert
that
god
was
not
satisfied
with
his
promises
but
after
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
he
gave
the
law
god
they
say
must
have
mistrusted
his
own
promises
and
considered
them
inadequate
for
salvation
therefore
he
added
to
his
promises
something
better
the
law
the
law
they
say
canceled
the
promises
paul
answers
the
law
was
given
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
after
the
promise
was
made
to
abraham
the
law
could
not
cancel
the
promise
because
the
promise
was
the
testament
of
god
confirmed
by
god
in
christ
many
years
before
the
law
what
god
has
once
promised
he
does
not
take
back
every
promise
of
god
is
a
ratified
promise
why
was
the
law
added
to
the
promise
not
to
serve
as
a
medium
by
which
the
promise
might
be
obtained
the
law
was
added
for
these
reasons
that
there
might
be
in
the
world
a
special
people
rigidly
controlled
by
the
law
a
people
out
of
which
christ
should
be
born
in
due
time
and
that
men
burdened
by
many
laws
might
sigh
and
long
for
him
their
redeemer
the
seed
of
abraham
even
the
ceremonies
prescribed
by
the
law
foreshadowed
christ
therefore
the
law
was
never
meant
to
cancel
the
promise
of
god
the
law
was
meant
to
confirm
the
promise
until
the
time
should
come
when
god
would
open
his
testament
in
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
god
did
well
in
giving
the
promise
so
many
years
before
the
law
that
it
may
never
be
said
that
righteousness
is
granted
through
the
law
and
not
through
the
promise
if
god
had
meant
for
us
to
be
justified
by
the
law
he
would
have
given
the
law
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
before
the
promise
at
least
he
would
have
given
the
law
at
the
same
time
he
gave
the
promise
but
he
never
breathed
a
word
about
the
law
until
four
hundred
years
after
the
promise
is
therefore
better
than
the
law
the
law
does
not
cancel
the
promise
but
faith
in
the
promised
christ
cancels
the
law
the
apostle
is
careful
to
mention
the
exact
number
of
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
the
wide
divergence
in
the
time
between
the
promise
and
the
law
helps
to
clinch
paul
argument
that
righteousness
is
not
obtained
by
the
law
let
me
illustrate
a
man
of
great
wealth
adopts
a
strange
lad
for
his
son
remember
he
does
not
owe
the
lad
anything
in
due
time
he
appoints
the
lad
heir
to
his
entire
fortune
several
years
later
the
old
man
asks
the
lad
to
do
something
for
him
and
the
young
lad
does
it
can
the
lad
then
go
around
and
say
that
he
deserved
the
inheritance
by
his
obedience
to
the
old
man
request
how
can
anybody
say
that
righteousness
is
obtained
by
obedience
to
the
law
when
the
law
was
given
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
after
god
promise
of
the
blessing
one
thing
is
certain
abraham
was
never
justified
by
the
law
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
law
was
not
in
his
day
if
the
law
was
how
could
abraham
obtain
righteousness
by
the
law
abraham
had
nothing
else
to
go
by
but
the
promise
this
promise
he
believed
and
that
was
counted
unto
him
for
righteousness
if
the
father
obtained
righteousness
through
faith
the
children
get
it
the
same
way
we
use
the
argument
of
time
also
we
say
our
sins
were
taken
away
by
the
death
of
christ
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
long
before
there
were
any
religious
orders
canons
or
rules
of
penance
merits
etc
what
did
people
do
about
their
sins
before
these
new
inventions
were
hatched
up
paul
finds
his
arguments
for
the
righteousness
of
faith
everywhere
even
the
element
of
time
serves
to
build
his
case
against
the
false
apostles
let
us
fortify
our
conscience
with
similar
arguments
they
help
us
in
the
trials
of
our
faith
they
turn
our
attention
from
the
law
to
the
promises
from
sin
to
righteousness
from
death
to
life
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
paul
bears
down
on
this
argument
he
foresaw
this
confusion
of
the
promise
and
the
law
creeping
into
the
church
accustom
yourself
to
separate
law
and
gospel
even
in
regard
to
time
when
the
law
comes
to
pay
your
conscience
a
visit
say
mister
law
you
come
too
soon
the
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
are
up
yet
when
they
are
up
you
come
again
wo
you
verse
for
if
the
inheritance
be
of
the
law
it
is
no
more
of
promise
in
romans
the
apostle
writes
for
if
they
which
are
made
of
the
law
be
heirs
faith
is
made
void
and
the
promise
made
of
none
effect
it
can
not
be
otherwise
that
the
law
is
something
entirely
different
from
the
promise
is
plain
the
law
thunders
thou
shalt
thou
shalt
not
the
promise
of
the
seed
pleads
take
this
gift
of
god
if
the
inheritance
of
the
gifts
of
god
were
obtained
by
the
law
god
would
be
a
liar
we
would
have
the
right
to
ask
him
why
did
you
make
this
promise
in
the
first
place
thy
seed
shall
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
be
blessed
why
did
you
not
say
thy
works
thou
shalt
be
blessed
verse
but
god
gave
it
to
abraham
by
promise
so
much
is
certain
before
the
law
ever
existed
god
gave
abraham
the
inheritance
or
blessing
by
the
promise
in
other
words
god
granted
unto
abraham
remission
of
sins
righteousness
salvation
and
everlasting
life
and
not
only
to
abraham
but
to
all
believers
because
god
said
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
be
blessed
the
blessing
was
given
unconditionally
the
law
had
no
chance
to
butt
in
because
moses
was
not
yet
born
how
then
can
you
say
that
righteousness
is
obtained
by
the
law
the
apostle
now
goes
to
work
to
explain
the
province
and
purpose
of
the
law
verse
wherefore
then
serveth
the
law
the
question
naturally
arises
if
the
law
was
not
given
for
righteousness
or
salvation
why
was
it
given
why
did
god
give
the
law
in
the
first
place
if
it
can
not
justify
a
person
the
jews
believed
if
they
kept
the
law
they
would
be
saved
when
they
heard
that
the
gospel
proclaimed
a
christ
who
had
come
into
the
world
to
save
sinners
and
not
the
righteous
when
they
heard
that
sinners
were
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
before
the
righteous
the
jews
were
very
much
put
out
they
murmured
these
last
have
wrought
but
one
hour
and
thou
hast
made
them
equal
unto
us
which
have
borne
the
burden
and
heat
of
the
day
matthew
they
complained
that
the
heathen
who
at
one
time
had
been
worshipers
of
idols
obtained
grace
without
the
drudgery
of
the
law
that
was
theirs
today
we
hear
the
same
complaints
what
was
the
use
of
our
having
lived
in
a
cloister
twenty
thirty
forty
years
what
was
the
sense
of
having
vowed
chastity
poverty
obedience
what
good
are
all
the
masses
and
canonical
hours
that
we
read
what
profit
is
there
in
fasting
praying
if
any
man
or
woman
any
beggar
or
scour
woman
is
to
be
made
equal
to
us
or
even
be
considered
more
acceptable
unto
god
than
we
reason
takes
offense
at
the
statement
of
paul
the
law
was
added
because
of
transgressions
people
say
that
paul
abrogated
the
law
that
he
is
a
radical
that
he
blasphemed
god
when
he
said
that
people
say
we
might
as
well
live
like
wild
people
if
the
law
does
not
count
let
us
abound
in
sin
that
grace
may
abound
let
us
do
evil
that
good
may
come
of
it
what
are
we
to
do
such
scoffing
distresses
us
but
we
can
not
stop
it
christ
himself
was
accused
of
being
a
blasphemer
and
rebel
paul
and
all
the
other
apostles
were
told
the
same
things
let
the
scoffers
slander
us
let
them
spare
us
not
but
we
must
not
on
their
account
keep
silent
we
must
speak
frankly
in
order
that
afflicted
consciences
may
find
surcease
neither
are
we
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
foolish
and
ungodly
people
for
abusing
our
doctrine
they
are
the
kind
that
would
scoff
law
or
no
law
our
first
consideration
must
be
the
comfort
of
troubled
consciences
that
they
may
not
perish
with
the
multitudes
when
he
saw
that
some
were
offended
at
his
doctrine
while
others
found
in
it
encouragement
to
live
after
the
flesh
paul
comforted
himself
with
the
thought
that
it
was
his
duty
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
elect
of
god
and
that
for
their
sake
he
must
endure
all
things
like
paul
we
also
do
all
these
things
for
the
sake
of
god
elect
as
for
the
scoffers
and
skeptics
i
am
so
disgusted
with
them
that
in
all
my
life
i
would
not
open
my
mouth
for
them
once
i
wish
that
they
were
back
there
where
they
belong
under
the
iron
heel
of
the
pope
people
foolish
but
wise
in
their
conceits
jump
to
the
conclusion
if
the
law
does
not
justify
it
is
good
for
nothing
how
about
that
because
money
does
not
justify
would
you
say
that
money
is
good
for
nothing
because
the
eyes
do
not
justify
would
you
have
them
taken
out
because
the
law
does
not
justify
it
does
not
follow
that
the
law
is
without
value
we
must
find
and
define
the
proper
purpose
of
the
law
we
do
not
offhand
condemn
the
law
because
we
say
it
does
not
justify
we
say
with
paul
that
the
law
is
good
if
it
is
used
properly
within
its
proper
sphere
the
law
is
an
excellent
thing
but
if
we
ascribe
to
the
law
functions
for
which
it
was
never
intended
we
pervert
not
only
the
law
but
also
the
gospel
it
is
the
universal
impression
that
righteousness
is
obtained
through
the
deeds
of
the
law
this
impression
is
instinctive
and
therefore
doubly
dangerous
gross
sins
and
vices
may
be
recognized
or
else
repressed
by
the
threat
of
punishment
but
this
sin
this
opinion
of
man
own
righteousness
refuses
to
be
classified
as
sin
it
wants
to
be
esteemed
as
religion
hence
it
constitutes
the
mighty
influence
of
the
devil
over
the
entire
world
in
order
to
point
out
the
true
office
of
the
law
and
thus
to
stamp
out
that
false
impression
of
the
righteousness
of
the
law
paul
answers
the
question
wherefore
then
serveth
the
law
with
the
words
verse
it
was
added
because
of
transgressions
all
things
differ
let
everything
serve
its
unique
purpose
let
the
sun
shine
by
day
the
moon
and
the
stars
by
night
let
the
sea
furnish
fish
the
earth
grain
the
woods
trees
etc
let
the
law
also
serve
its
unique
purpose
it
must
not
step
out
of
character
and
take
the
place
of
anything
else
what
is
the
function
of
the
law
transgression
answers
the
apostle
the
twofold
purpose
of
the
law
the
law
has
a
twofold
purpose
one
purpose
is
civil
god
has
ordained
civil
laws
to
punish
crime
every
law
is
given
to
restrain
sin
does
it
not
then
make
men
righteous
no
in
refraining
from
murder
adultery
theft
or
other
sins
i
do
so
under
compulsion
because
i
fear
the
jail
the
noose
the
electric
chair
these
restrain
me
as
iron
bars
restrain
a
lion
and
a
bear
otherwise
they
would
tear
everything
to
pieces
such
forceful
restraint
can
not
be
regarded
as
righteousness
rather
as
an
indication
of
unrighteousness
as
a
wild
beast
is
tied
to
keep
it
from
running
amuck
so
the
law
bridles
mad
and
furious
man
to
keep
him
from
running
wild
the
need
for
restraint
shows
plainly
enough
that
those
who
need
the
law
are
not
righteous
but
wicked
men
who
are
fit
to
be
tied
no
the
law
does
not
justify
the
first
purpose
of
the
law
accordingly
is
to
restrain
the
wicked
the
devil
gets
people
into
all
kinds
of
scrapes
therefore
god
instituted
governments
parents
laws
restrictions
and
civil
ordinances
at
least
they
help
to
tie
the
devil
hands
so
that
he
does
not
rage
up
and
down
the
earth
this
civil
restraint
by
the
law
is
intended
by
god
for
the
preservation
of
all
things
particularly
for
the
good
of
the
gospel
that
it
should
not
be
hindered
too
much
by
the
tumult
of
the
wicked
but
paul
is
not
now
treating
of
this
civil
use
and
function
of
the
law
the
second
purpose
of
the
law
is
spiritual
and
divine
paul
describes
this
spiritual
purpose
of
the
law
in
the
words
because
of
transgressions
to
reveal
to
a
person
his
sin
blindness
misery
his
ignorance
hatred
and
contempt
of
god
his
death
hell
and
condemnation
this
is
the
principal
purpose
of
the
law
and
its
most
valuable
contribution
as
long
as
a
person
is
not
a
murderer
adulterer
thief
he
would
swear
that
he
is
righteous
how
is
god
going
to
humble
such
a
person
except
by
the
law
the
law
is
the
hammer
of
death
the
thunder
of
hell
and
the
lightning
of
god
wrath
to
bring
down
the
proud
and
shameless
hypocrites
when
the
law
was
instituted
on
mount
sinai
it
was
accompanied
by
lightning
by
storms
by
the
sound
of
trumpets
to
tear
to
pieces
that
monster
called
as
long
as
a
person
thinks
he
is
right
he
is
going
to
be
incomprehensibly
proud
and
presumptuous
he
is
going
to
hate
god
despise
his
grace
and
mercy
and
ignore
the
promises
in
christ
the
gospel
of
the
free
forgiveness
of
sins
through
christ
will
never
appeal
to
the
this
monster
of
this
beast
needs
a
big
axe
and
that
is
what
the
law
is
a
big
axe
accordingly
the
proper
use
and
function
of
the
law
is
to
threaten
until
the
conscience
is
scared
stiff
the
awful
spectacle
at
mount
sinai
portrayed
the
proper
use
of
the
law
when
the
children
of
israel
came
out
of
egypt
a
feeling
of
singular
holiness
possessed
them
they
boasted
we
are
the
people
of
god
all
that
the
lord
hath
spoken
we
will
do
ex
this
feeling
of
holiness
was
heightened
when
moses
ordered
them
to
wash
their
clothes
to
refrain
from
their
wives
and
to
prepare
themselves
all
around
the
third
day
came
and
moses
led
the
people
out
of
their
tents
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
into
the
presence
of
the
lord
what
happened
when
the
children
of
israel
saw
the
whole
mountain
burning
and
smoking
the
black
clouds
rent
by
fierce
lightning
flashing
up
and
down
in
the
inky
darkness
when
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
blowing
louder
and
longer
shattered
by
the
roll
of
thunder
they
were
so
frightened
that
they
begged
moses
speak
thou
with
us
and
we
will
hear
but
let
not
god
speak
with
us
lest
we
die
ex
i
ask
you
what
good
did
their
scrubbing
their
clothes
and
their
continence
do
them
no
good
at
all
not
a
single
one
could
stand
in
the
presence
of
the
glorious
lord
stricken
by
the
terror
of
god
they
fled
back
into
their
tents
as
if
the
devil
were
after
them
the
law
is
meant
to
produce
the
same
effect
today
which
it
produced
at
mount
sinai
long
ago
i
want
to
encourage
all
who
fear
god
especially
those
who
intend
to
become
ministers
of
the
gospel
to
learn
from
the
apostle
the
proper
use
of
the
law
i
fear
that
after
our
time
the
right
handling
of
the
law
will
become
a
lost
art
even
now
although
we
continually
explain
the
separate
functions
of
the
law
and
the
gospel
we
have
those
among
us
who
do
not
understand
how
the
law
should
be
used
what
will
it
be
like
when
we
are
dead
and
gone
we
want
it
understood
that
we
do
not
reject
the
law
as
our
opponents
claim
on
the
contrary
we
uphold
the
law
we
say
the
law
is
good
if
it
is
used
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
designed
to
check
civil
transgression
and
to
magnify
spiritual
transgressions
the
law
is
also
a
light
like
the
gospel
but
instead
of
revealing
the
grace
of
god
righteousness
and
life
the
law
brings
sin
death
and
the
wrath
of
god
to
light
this
is
the
business
of
the
law
and
here
the
business
of
the
law
ends
and
should
go
no
further
the
business
of
the
gospel
on
the
other
hand
is
to
quicken
to
comfort
to
raise
the
fallen
the
gospel
carries
the
news
that
god
for
christ
sake
is
merciful
to
the
most
unworthy
sinners
if
they
will
only
believe
that
christ
by
his
death
has
delivered
them
from
sin
and
everlasting
death
unto
grace
forgiveness
and
everlasting
life
by
keeping
in
mind
the
difference
between
the
law
and
the
gospel
we
let
each
perform
its
special
task
of
this
difference
between
the
law
and
the
gospel
nothing
can
be
discovered
in
the
writings
of
the
monks
or
scholastics
nor
for
that
matter
in
the
writings
of
the
ancient
fathers
augustine
understood
the
difference
somewhat
jerome
and
others
knew
nothing
of
it
the
silence
in
the
church
concerning
the
difference
between
the
law
and
the
gospel
has
resulted
in
untold
harm
unless
a
sharp
distinction
is
maintained
between
the
purpose
and
function
of
the
law
and
the
gospel
the
christian
doctrine
can
not
be
kept
free
from
error
verse
it
was
added
because
of
transgressions
in
other
words
that
transgressions
might
be
recognized
as
such
and
thus
increased
when
sin
death
and
the
wrath
of
god
are
revealed
to
a
person
by
the
law
he
grows
impatient
complains
against
god
and
rebels
before
that
he
was
a
very
holy
man
he
worshipped
and
praised
god
he
bowed
his
knees
before
god
and
gave
thanks
like
the
pharisee
but
now
that
sin
and
death
are
revealed
to
him
by
the
law
he
wishes
there
were
no
god
the
law
inspires
hatred
of
god
thus
sin
is
not
only
revealed
by
the
law
sin
is
actually
increased
and
magnified
by
the
law
the
law
is
a
mirror
to
show
a
person
what
he
is
like
a
sinner
who
is
guilty
of
death
and
worthy
of
everlasting
punishment
what
is
this
bruising
and
beating
by
the
hand
of
the
law
to
accomplish
this
that
we
may
find
the
way
to
grace
the
law
is
an
usher
to
lead
the
way
to
grace
god
is
the
god
of
the
humble
the
miserable
the
afflicted
it
is
his
nature
to
exalt
the
humble
to
comfort
the
sorrowing
to
heal
the
to
justify
the
sinners
and
to
save
the
condemned
the
fatuous
idea
that
a
person
can
be
holy
by
himself
denies
god
the
pleasure
of
saving
sinners
god
must
therefore
first
take
the
of
the
law
in
his
fists
and
smash
the
beast
of
and
its
brood
of
and
when
the
conscience
has
been
thoroughly
frightened
by
the
law
it
welcomes
the
gospel
of
grace
with
its
message
of
a
savior
who
came
into
the
world
not
to
break
the
bruised
reed
nor
to
quench
the
smoking
flax
but
to
preach
glad
tidings
to
the
poor
to
heal
the
and
to
grant
forgiveness
of
sins
to
all
the
captives
man
folly
however
is
so
prodigious
that
instead
of
embracing
the
message
of
grace
with
its
guarantee
of
the
forgiveness
of
sin
for
christ
sake
man
finds
himself
more
laws
to
satisfy
his
conscience
if
i
live
says
he
i
will
mend
my
life
i
will
do
this
i
will
do
that
man
if
you
do
do
the
very
opposite
if
you
do
send
moses
with
the
law
back
to
mount
sinai
and
take
the
hand
of
christ
pierced
for
your
sins
you
will
never
be
saved
when
the
law
drives
you
to
the
point
of
despair
let
it
drive
you
a
little
farther
let
it
drive
you
straight
into
the
arms
of
jesus
who
says
come
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
verse
till
the
seed
should
come
to
whom
the
promise
was
made
the
law
is
not
to
have
its
say
indefinitely
we
must
know
how
long
the
law
is
to
put
in
its
licks
if
it
hammers
away
too
long
no
person
would
and
could
be
saved
the
law
has
a
boundary
beyond
which
it
must
not
go
how
long
ought
the
law
to
hold
sway
till
the
seed
should
come
to
whom
the
promise
was
made
that
may
be
taken
literally
to
mean
until
the
time
of
the
gospel
from
the
days
of
john
the
baptist
says
jesus
until
now
the
kingdom
of
heaven
suffereth
violence
and
the
violent
take
it
by
force
for
all
the
prophets
and
the
law
prophesied
until
john
matthew
when
christ
came
the
law
and
the
ceremonies
of
moses
ceased
spiritually
it
means
that
the
law
is
not
to
operate
on
a
person
after
he
has
been
humbled
and
frightened
by
the
exposure
of
his
sins
and
the
wrath
of
god
we
must
then
say
to
the
law
mister
law
lay
off
him
he
has
had
enough
you
scared
him
good
and
proper
now
it
is
the
turn
now
let
christ
with
his
gracious
lips
talk
to
him
of
better
things
grace
peace
forgiveness
of
sins
and
eternal
life
verse
and
it
was
ordained
by
angels
in
the
hand
of
a
mediator
the
apostle
digresses
a
little
from
his
immediate
theme
something
occurred
to
him
and
he
throws
it
in
by
the
way
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
law
differs
from
the
gospel
in
another
respect
in
respect
to
authorship
the
law
was
delivered
by
the
angels
but
the
gospel
by
the
lord
himself
hence
the
gospel
is
superior
to
the
law
as
the
word
of
a
lord
is
superior
to
the
word
of
his
servant
the
law
was
handed
down
by
a
being
even
inferior
to
the
angels
by
a
middleman
named
moses
paul
wants
us
to
understand
that
christ
is
the
mediator
of
a
better
testament
than
mediator
moses
of
the
law
moses
led
the
people
out
of
their
tents
to
meet
god
but
they
ran
away
that
is
how
good
a
mediator
moses
was
paul
says
how
can
the
law
justify
when
that
whole
sanctified
people
of
israel
and
even
mediator
moses
trembled
at
the
voice
of
god
what
kind
of
righteousness
do
you
call
that
when
people
run
away
from
it
and
hate
it
the
worst
way
if
the
law
could
justify
people
would
love
the
law
but
look
at
the
children
of
israel
running
away
from
it
the
flight
of
the
children
of
israel
from
mount
sinai
indicates
how
people
feel
about
the
law
they
do
like
it
if
this
were
the
only
argument
to
prove
that
salvation
is
not
by
the
law
this
one
bible
history
would
do
the
work
what
kind
of
righteousness
is
this
when
at
the
commencement
exercises
of
the
law
moses
and
the
scrubbed
people
run
away
from
it
so
fast
that
an
iron
mountain
the
red
sea
even
could
not
have
stopped
them
until
they
were
back
in
egypt
once
again
if
they
could
not
hear
the
law
how
could
they
ever
hope
to
perform
the
law
if
all
the
world
had
stood
at
the
mountain
all
the
world
would
have
hated
the
law
and
fled
from
it
as
the
children
of
israel
did
the
whole
world
is
an
enemy
of
the
law
how
then
can
anyone
be
justified
by
the
law
when
everybody
hates
the
law
and
its
divine
author
all
this
goes
to
show
how
little
the
scholastics
know
about
the
law
they
do
not
consider
its
spiritual
effect
and
purpose
which
is
not
to
justify
or
to
pacify
afflicted
consciences
but
to
increase
sin
to
terrify
the
conscience
and
to
produce
wrath
in
their
ignorance
the
papists
spout
about
man
good
will
and
right
judgment
and
capacity
to
perform
the
law
of
god
ask
the
people
of
israel
who
were
present
at
the
presentation
of
the
law
on
mount
sinai
whether
what
the
scholastics
say
is
true
ask
david
who
often
complains
in
the
psalms
that
he
was
cast
away
from
god
and
in
hell
that
he
was
frantic
about
his
sin
and
sick
at
the
thought
of
the
wrath
and
judgment
of
god
no
the
law
does
not
justify
verse
now
a
mediator
is
not
a
mediator
of
one
here
the
apostle
briefly
compares
the
two
mediators
moses
and
christ
a
mediator
says
paul
is
not
a
mediator
of
one
he
is
necessarily
a
mediator
of
two
the
offender
and
the
offended
moses
was
such
a
mediator
between
the
law
and
the
people
who
were
offended
at
the
law
they
were
offended
at
the
law
because
they
did
not
understand
its
purpose
that
was
the
veil
which
moses
put
over
his
face
the
people
were
also
offended
at
the
law
because
they
could
not
look
at
the
bare
face
of
moses
it
shone
with
the
glory
of
god
when
moses
addressed
the
people
he
had
to
cover
his
face
with
that
veil
of
his
they
could
not
listen
to
their
mediator
moses
without
another
mediator
the
veil
the
law
had
to
change
its
face
and
voice
in
other
words
the
law
had
to
be
made
tolerable
to
the
people
thus
covered
the
law
no
longer
spoke
to
the
people
in
its
undisguised
majesty
it
became
more
tolerable
to
the
conscience
this
explains
why
men
fail
to
understand
the
law
properly
with
the
result
that
they
become
secure
and
presumptuous
hypocrites
one
of
two
things
has
to
be
done
either
the
law
must
be
covered
with
a
veil
and
then
it
loses
its
full
effectiveness
or
it
must
be
unveiled
and
then
the
full
blast
of
its
force
kills
man
can
not
stand
the
law
without
a
veil
over
it
hence
we
are
forced
either
to
look
beyond
the
law
to
christ
or
we
go
through
life
as
shameless
hypocrites
and
secure
sinners
paul
says
a
mediator
is
not
a
mediator
of
one
moses
could
not
be
a
mediator
of
god
only
for
god
needs
no
mediator
again
moses
could
not
be
a
mediator
of
the
people
only
he
was
a
mediator
between
god
and
the
people
it
is
the
office
of
a
mediator
to
conciliate
the
party
that
is
offended
and
to
placate
the
party
that
is
the
offender
however
mediation
consisted
only
in
changing
the
tone
of
the
law
to
make
it
more
tolerable
to
the
people
moses
was
merely
a
mediator
of
the
veil
he
could
not
supply
the
ability
to
perform
the
law
what
do
you
suppose
would
have
happened
if
the
law
had
been
given
without
a
mediator
and
the
people
had
been
denied
the
services
of
a
the
people
would
have
perished
or
in
case
they
had
escaped
they
would
have
required
the
services
of
another
mediator
to
preserve
them
alive
and
to
keep
the
law
in
force
moses
came
along
and
he
was
made
the
mediator
he
covered
his
face
with
a
veil
but
that
is
as
much
as
he
could
do
he
could
not
deliver
men
consciences
from
the
terror
of
the
law
the
sinner
needs
a
better
mediator
that
better
mediator
is
jesus
christ
he
does
not
change
the
voice
of
the
law
nor
does
he
hide
the
law
with
a
veil
he
takes
the
full
blast
of
the
wrath
of
the
law
and
fulfills
its
demands
most
meticulously
of
this
better
mediator
paul
says
a
mediator
is
not
a
mediator
of
one
we
are
the
offending
party
god
is
the
party
offended
the
offense
is
of
such
a
nature
that
god
can
not
pardon
it
neither
can
we
render
adequate
satisfaction
for
our
offenses
there
is
discord
between
god
and
us
could
not
god
revoke
his
law
no
how
about
running
away
from
god
it
can
not
be
done
it
took
christ
to
come
between
us
and
god
and
to
reconcile
god
to
us
how
did
christ
do
it
blotting
out
the
handwriting
of
ordinances
that
was
against
us
which
was
contrary
to
us
and
took
it
out
of
the
way
nailing
it
to
his
cross
col
this
one
word
mediator
is
proof
enough
that
the
law
can
not
justify
otherwise
we
should
not
need
a
mediator
in
christian
theology
the
law
does
not
justify
in
fact
it
has
the
contrary
effect
the
law
alarms
us
it
magnifies
our
sins
until
we
begin
to
hate
the
law
and
its
divine
author
would
you
call
this
being
justified
by
the
law
can
you
imagine
a
more
arrant
outrage
than
to
hate
god
and
to
abhor
his
law
what
an
excellent
law
it
is
listen
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
which
have
brought
thee
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
out
of
the
house
of
bondage
thou
shalt
have
no
other
gods
showing
mercy
unto
thousands
honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
that
thy
days
may
be
long
upon
the
land
ex
are
these
not
excellent
laws
perfect
wisdom
let
not
god
speak
with
us
lest
we
die
cried
the
children
of
israel
is
it
not
amazing
that
a
person
should
refuse
to
hear
things
that
are
good
for
him
any
person
would
be
glad
to
hear
i
should
think
that
he
has
a
gracious
god
who
shows
mercy
unto
thousands
is
it
not
amazing
that
people
hate
the
law
that
promotes
their
safety
and
welfare
thou
shalt
not
kill
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
thou
shalt
not
steal
the
law
can
do
nothing
for
us
except
to
arouse
the
conscience
before
the
law
comes
to
me
i
feel
no
sin
but
when
the
law
comes
sin
death
and
hell
are
revealed
to
me
you
would
not
call
this
being
made
righteous
you
would
call
it
being
condemned
to
death
and
verse
but
god
is
one
god
does
not
offend
anybody
therefore
he
needs
no
mediator
but
we
offend
god
therefore
we
need
a
mediator
and
we
need
a
better
mediator
than
moses
we
need
christ
verse
is
the
law
then
against
the
promises
of
god
before
he
digressed
paul
stated
that
the
law
does
not
justify
shall
we
then
discard
the
law
no
no
it
supplies
a
certain
need
it
supplies
men
with
a
needed
realization
of
their
sinfulness
now
arises
another
question
if
the
law
does
no
more
than
to
reveal
sin
does
it
not
oppose
the
promises
of
god
the
jews
believed
that
by
the
restraint
and
discipline
of
the
law
the
promises
of
god
would
be
hastened
in
fact
earned
by
them
paul
answers
not
so
on
the
contrary
if
we
pay
too
much
attention
to
the
law
the
promises
of
god
will
be
slowed
up
how
can
god
fulfill
his
promises
to
a
people
that
hates
the
law
verse
god
forbid
god
never
said
to
abraham
in
thee
shall
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
be
blessed
because
thou
hast
kept
the
law
when
abraham
was
still
uncircumcised
and
without
the
law
or
any
law
indeed
when
he
was
still
an
idol
worshiper
god
said
to
him
get
thee
out
of
thy
country
etc
i
am
thy
shield
etc
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
be
blessed
these
are
unconditional
promises
which
god
freely
made
to
abraham
without
respect
to
works
this
is
aimed
especially
at
the
jews
who
think
that
the
promises
of
god
are
impeded
by
their
sins
paul
says
the
lord
is
not
slack
concerning
his
promises
because
of
our
sins
or
hastens
his
promises
because
of
any
merit
on
our
part
god
promises
are
not
influenced
by
our
attitudes
they
rest
in
his
goodness
and
mercy
just
because
the
law
increases
sin
it
does
not
therefore
obstruct
the
promises
of
god
the
law
confirms
the
promises
in
that
it
prepares
a
person
to
look
for
the
fulfillment
of
the
promises
of
god
in
christ
the
proverb
has
it
that
hunger
is
the
best
cook
the
law
makes
afflicted
consciences
hungry
for
christ
christ
tastes
good
to
them
hungry
hearts
appreciate
christ
thirsty
souls
are
what
christ
wants
he
invites
them
come
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
christ
benefits
are
so
precious
that
he
will
dispense
them
only
to
those
who
need
them
and
really
desire
them
verse
for
if
there
had
been
a
law
given
which
could
have
given
life
verily
righteousness
should
have
been
by
the
law
the
law
can
not
give
life
it
kills
the
law
does
not
justify
a
person
before
god
it
increases
sin
the
law
does
not
secure
righteousness
it
hinders
righteousness
the
apostle
declares
emphatically
that
the
law
of
itself
can
not
save
despite
the
intelligibility
of
paul
statement
our
enemies
fail
to
grasp
it
otherwise
they
would
not
emphasize
free
will
natural
strength
the
works
of
supererogation
etc
to
escape
the
charge
of
forgery
they
always
have
their
convenient
annotation
handy
that
paul
is
referring
only
to
the
ceremonial
and
not
to
the
moral
law
but
paul
includes
all
laws
he
expressly
says
if
there
had
been
a
law
given
there
is
no
law
by
which
righteousness
may
be
obtained
not
a
single
one
why
not
verse
but
the
scripture
hath
concluded
all
under
sin
where
first
in
the
promises
concerning
christ
in
genesis
and
in
genesis
which
speak
of
the
seed
of
the
woman
and
the
seed
of
abraham
the
fact
that
these
promises
were
made
unto
the
fathers
concerning
christ
implies
that
the
fathers
were
subject
to
the
curse
of
sin
and
eternal
death
otherwise
why
the
need
of
promises
next
holy
writ
concludes
all
under
sin
in
this
passage
from
paul
for
as
many
as
are
of
the
works
of
the
law
are
under
the
curse
again
in
the
passage
which
the
apostle
quotes
from
deuteronomy
cursed
is
every
one
that
continueth
not
in
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
to
do
them
this
passage
clearly
submits
all
men
to
the
curse
not
only
those
who
sin
openly
against
the
law
but
also
those
who
sincerely
endeavor
to
perform
the
law
inclusive
of
monks
friars
hermits
etc
the
conclusion
is
inevitable
faith
alone
justified
without
works
if
the
law
itself
can
not
justify
much
less
can
imperfect
performance
of
the
law
or
the
works
of
the
law
justify
verse
that
the
promise
by
faith
of
jesus
christ
might
be
given
to
them
that
believe
the
apostle
stated
before
that
the
scripture
hath
concluded
all
under
sin
forever
no
only
until
the
promise
should
be
fulfilled
the
promise
you
will
recall
is
the
inheritance
itself
or
the
blessing
promised
to
abraham
deliverance
from
the
law
sin
death
and
the
devil
and
the
free
gift
of
grace
righteousness
salvation
and
eternal
life
this
promise
says
paul
is
not
obtained
by
any
merit
by
any
law
or
by
any
work
this
promise
is
given
to
whom
to
those
who
believe
in
whom
in
jesus
christ
verse
but
before
faith
came
the
apostle
proceeds
to
explain
the
service
which
the
law
is
to
render
previously
paul
had
said
that
the
law
was
given
to
reveal
the
wrath
and
death
of
god
upon
all
sinners
although
the
law
kills
god
brings
good
out
of
evil
he
uses
the
law
to
bring
life
god
saw
that
the
universal
illusion
of
could
not
be
put
down
in
any
other
way
but
by
the
law
the
law
dispels
all
it
puts
the
fear
of
god
in
a
man
without
this
fear
there
can
be
no
thirst
for
god
mercy
god
accordingly
uses
the
law
for
a
hammer
to
break
up
the
illusion
of
that
we
should
despair
of
our
own
strength
and
efforts
at
verse
but
before
faith
came
we
were
kept
under
the
law
shut
up
unto
the
faith
which
should
afterwards
be
revealed
the
law
is
a
prison
to
those
who
have
not
as
yet
obtained
grace
no
prisoner
enjoys
the
confinement
he
hates
it
if
he
could
he
would
smash
the
prison
and
find
his
freedom
at
all
cost
as
long
as
he
stays
in
prison
he
refrains
from
evil
deeds
not
because
he
wants
to
but
because
he
has
to
the
bars
and
the
chains
restrain
him
he
does
not
regret
the
crime
that
put
him
in
jail
on
the
contrary
he
is
mighty
sore
that
he
can
not
rob
and
kill
as
before
if
he
could
escape
he
would
go
right
back
to
robbing
and
killing
the
law
enforces
good
behavior
at
least
outwardly
we
obey
the
law
because
if
we
do
we
will
be
punished
our
obedience
is
inspired
by
fear
we
obey
under
duress
and
we
do
it
resentfully
now
what
kind
of
righteousness
is
this
when
we
refrain
from
evil
out
of
fear
of
punishment
hence
the
righteousness
of
the
law
is
at
bottom
nothing
but
love
of
sin
and
hatred
of
righteousness
all
the
same
the
law
accomplishes
this
much
that
it
will
outwardly
at
least
and
to
a
certain
extent
repress
vice
and
crime
but
the
law
is
also
a
spiritual
prison
a
veritable
hell
when
the
law
begins
to
threaten
a
person
with
death
and
the
eternal
wrath
of
god
a
man
just
can
not
find
any
comfort
at
all
he
can
not
shake
off
at
will
the
nightmare
of
terror
which
the
law
stirs
up
in
his
conscience
of
this
terror
of
the
law
the
psalms
furnish
many
glimpses
the
law
is
a
civil
and
a
spiritual
prison
and
such
it
should
be
for
that
the
law
is
intended
only
the
confinement
in
the
prison
of
the
law
must
not
be
unduly
prolonged
it
must
come
to
an
end
the
freedom
of
faith
must
succeed
the
imprisonment
of
the
law
happy
the
person
who
knows
how
to
utilize
the
law
so
that
it
serves
the
purposes
of
grace
and
of
faith
unbelievers
are
ignorant
of
this
happy
knowledge
when
cain
was
first
shut
up
in
the
prison
of
the
law
he
felt
no
pang
at
the
fratricide
he
had
committed
he
thought
he
could
pass
it
off
as
an
incident
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulder
am
i
my
keeper
he
answered
god
flippantly
but
when
he
heard
the
ominous
words
what
hast
thou
done
the
voice
of
thy
brother
blood
crieth
unto
me
from
the
ground
cain
began
to
feel
his
imprisonment
did
he
know
how
to
get
out
of
prison
no
he
failed
to
call
the
gospel
to
his
aid
he
said
my
punishment
is
greater
than
i
can
bear
he
could
only
think
of
the
prison
he
forgot
that
he
was
brought
face
to
face
with
his
crime
so
that
he
should
hurry
to
god
for
mercy
and
for
pardon
cain
remained
in
the
prison
of
the
law
and
despaired
as
a
stone
prison
proves
a
physical
handicap
so
the
spiritual
prison
of
the
law
proves
a
chamber
of
torture
but
this
it
should
only
be
until
faith
be
revealed
the
silly
conscience
must
be
educated
to
this
talk
to
your
conscience
say
sister
you
are
now
in
jail
all
right
but
you
do
have
to
stay
there
forever
it
is
written
that
we
are
up
unto
faith
which
should
afterwards
be
revealed
christ
will
lead
you
to
freedom
do
not
despair
like
cain
saul
or
judas
they
might
have
gone
free
if
they
had
called
christ
to
their
aid
just
take
it
easy
sister
conscience
it
good
for
you
to
be
locked
up
for
a
while
it
will
teach
you
to
appreciate
christ
how
anybody
can
say
that
he
by
nature
loves
the
law
is
beyond
me
the
law
is
a
prison
to
be
feared
and
hated
any
unconverted
person
who
says
he
loves
the
law
is
a
liar
he
does
not
know
what
he
is
talking
about
we
love
the
law
about
as
well
as
a
murderer
loves
his
gloomy
cell
his
and
the
iron
bars
in
front
of
him
how
then
can
the
law
justify
us
verse
shut
up
unto
the
faith
which
should
afterwards
be
revealed
we
know
that
paul
has
reference
to
the
time
of
christ
coming
it
was
then
that
faith
and
the
object
of
faith
were
fully
revealed
but
we
may
apply
the
historical
fact
to
our
inner
life
when
christ
came
he
abolished
the
law
and
brought
liberty
and
life
to
light
this
he
continues
to
do
in
the
hearts
of
the
believers
the
christian
has
a
body
in
whose
members
as
paul
says
sin
dwells
and
wars
i
take
sin
to
mean
not
only
the
deed
but
root
tree
fruit
and
all
a
christian
may
perhaps
not
fall
into
the
gross
sins
of
murder
adultery
theft
but
he
is
not
free
from
impatience
complaints
hatreds
and
blasphemy
of
god
as
carnal
lust
is
strong
in
a
young
man
in
a
man
of
full
age
the
desire
for
glory
and
in
an
old
man
covetousness
so
impatience
doubt
and
hatred
of
god
often
prevail
in
the
hearts
of
sincere
christians
examples
of
these
sins
may
be
garnered
from
the
psalms
job
jeremiah
and
all
the
sacred
scriptures
accordingly
each
christian
continues
to
experience
in
his
heart
times
of
the
law
and
times
of
the
gospel
the
times
of
the
law
are
discernible
by
heaviness
of
heart
by
a
lively
sense
of
sin
and
a
feeling
of
despair
brought
on
by
the
law
these
periods
of
the
law
will
come
again
and
again
as
long
as
we
live
to
mention
my
own
case
there
are
many
times
when
i
find
fault
with
god
and
am
impatient
with
him
the
wrath
and
the
judgment
of
god
displease
me
my
wrath
and
impatience
displease
him
then
is
the
season
of
the
law
when
the
flesh
lusteth
against
the
spirit
and
the
spirit
against
the
flesh
the
time
of
grace
returns
when
the
heart
is
enlivened
by
the
promise
of
god
mercy
it
soliloquizes
why
art
thou
cast
down
o
my
soul
and
why
art
thou
disquieted
within
me
can
you
see
nothing
but
law
sin
death
and
hell
is
there
no
grace
no
forgiveness
no
joy
peace
life
heaven
no
christ
and
god
trouble
me
no
more
my
soul
hope
in
god
who
has
not
spared
his
own
dear
son
but
has
given
him
into
death
for
thy
sins
when
the
law
carries
things
too
far
say
mister
law
you
are
not
the
whole
show
there
are
other
and
better
things
than
you
they
tell
me
to
trust
in
the
lord
there
is
a
time
for
the
law
and
a
time
for
grace
let
us
study
to
be
good
timekeepers
it
is
not
easy
law
and
grace
may
be
miles
apart
in
essence
but
in
the
heart
they
are
pretty
close
together
in
the
heart
fear
and
trust
sin
and
grace
law
and
gospel
cross
paths
continually
whether
reason
hears
that
justification
before
god
is
obtained
by
grace
alone
it
draws
the
inference
that
the
law
is
without
value
the
doctrine
of
the
law
must
therefore
be
studied
carefully
lest
we
either
reject
the
law
altogether
or
are
tempted
to
attribute
to
the
law
a
capacity
to
save
there
are
three
ways
in
which
the
law
may
be
abused
first
by
the
hypocrites
who
fancy
that
they
can
be
justified
by
the
law
secondly
by
those
who
claim
that
christian
liberty
exempts
a
christian
from
the
observance
of
the
law
these
says
peter
use
their
liberty
for
a
cloak
of
maliciousness
and
bring
the
name
and
the
gospel
of
christ
into
ill
repute
thirdly
the
law
is
abused
by
those
who
do
not
understand
that
the
law
is
meant
to
drive
us
to
christ
when
the
law
is
properly
used
its
value
can
not
be
too
highly
appraised
it
will
take
me
to
christ
every
time
verse
wherefore
the
law
was
our
schoolmaster
to
bring
us
unto
christ
this
simile
of
the
schoolmaster
is
striking
schoolmasters
are
indispensable
but
show
me
a
pupil
who
loves
his
schoolmaster
how
little
love
is
lost
upon
them
the
jews
showed
by
their
attitude
toward
moses
they
would
have
been
glad
to
stone
moses
to
death
ex
you
can
not
expect
anything
else
how
can
a
pupil
love
a
teacher
who
frustrates
his
desires
and
if
the
pupil
disobeys
the
schoolmaster
whips
him
and
the
pupil
has
to
like
it
and
even
kiss
the
rod
with
which
he
was
beaten
do
you
think
the
schoolboy
feels
good
about
it
as
soon
as
the
teacher
turns
his
back
the
pupil
breaks
the
rod
and
throws
it
into
the
fire
and
if
he
were
stronger
than
the
teacher
he
would
not
take
the
beatings
but
beat
up
the
teacher
all
the
same
teachers
are
indispensable
otherwise
the
children
would
grow
up
without
discipline
instruction
and
training
but
how
long
are
the
scolding
and
the
whippings
of
the
schoolmaster
to
continue
only
for
a
time
until
the
boy
has
been
trained
to
be
a
worthy
heir
of
his
father
no
father
wants
his
son
to
be
whipped
all
the
time
the
discipline
is
to
last
until
the
boy
has
been
trained
to
be
his
father
worthy
successor
the
law
is
such
a
schoolmaster
not
for
always
but
until
we
have
been
brought
to
christ
the
law
is
not
just
another
schoolmaster
the
law
is
a
specialist
to
bring
us
to
christ
what
would
you
think
of
a
schoolmaster
who
could
only
torment
and
beat
a
child
yet
of
such
schoolmasters
there
were
plenty
in
former
times
regular
bruisers
the
law
is
not
that
kind
of
a
schoolmaster
it
is
not
to
torment
us
always
with
its
lashings
it
is
only
too
anxious
to
drive
us
to
christ
the
law
is
like
the
good
schoolmaster
who
trains
his
children
to
find
pleasure
in
doing
things
they
formerly
detested
verse
that
we
might
be
justified
by
faith
the
law
is
not
to
teach
us
another
law
when
a
person
feels
the
full
force
of
the
law
he
is
likely
to
think
i
have
transgressed
all
the
commandments
of
god
i
am
guilty
of
eternal
death
if
god
will
spare
me
i
will
change
and
live
right
from
now
on
this
natural
but
entirely
wrong
reaction
to
the
law
has
bred
the
many
ceremonies
and
works
devised
to
earn
grace
and
remission
of
sins
the
law
means
to
enlarge
my
sins
to
make
me
small
so
that
i
may
be
justified
by
faith
in
christ
faith
is
neither
law
nor
word
but
confidence
in
christ
who
is
the
end
of
the
law
how
so
is
christ
the
end
of
the
law
not
in
this
way
that
he
replaced
the
old
law
with
new
laws
nor
is
christ
the
end
of
the
law
in
a
way
that
makes
him
a
hard
judge
who
has
to
be
bribed
by
works
as
the
papists
teach
christ
is
the
end
or
finish
of
the
law
to
all
who
believe
in
him
the
law
can
no
longer
accuse
or
condemn
them
but
what
does
the
law
accomplish
for
those
who
have
been
justified
by
christ
paul
answers
this
question
next
verse
but
after
that
faith
is
come
we
are
no
longer
under
a
schoolmaster
the
apostle
declares
that
we
are
free
from
the
law
christ
fulfilled
the
law
for
us
we
may
live
in
joy
and
safety
under
christ
the
trouble
is
our
flesh
will
not
let
us
believe
in
christ
with
all
our
heart
the
fault
lies
not
with
christ
but
with
us
sin
clings
to
us
as
long
as
we
live
and
spoils
our
happiness
in
christ
hence
we
are
only
partly
free
from
the
law
with
the
mind
i
myself
serve
the
law
of
god
but
with
the
flesh
the
law
of
sin
romans
as
far
as
the
conscience
is
concerned
it
may
cheerfully
ignore
the
law
but
because
sin
continues
to
dwell
in
the
flesh
the
law
waits
around
to
molest
our
conscience
more
and
more
however
christ
increases
our
faith
and
in
the
measure
in
which
our
faith
is
increased
sin
law
and
flesh
subside
if
anybody
objects
to
the
gospel
and
the
sacraments
on
the
ground
that
christ
has
taken
away
our
sins
once
and
for
always
you
will
know
what
to
answer
you
will
answer
indeed
christ
has
taken
away
my
sins
but
my
flesh
the
world
and
the
devil
interfere
with
my
faith
the
little
light
of
faith
in
my
heart
does
not
shine
all
over
me
at
once
it
is
a
gradual
diffusion
in
the
meanwhile
i
console
myself
with
the
thought
that
eventually
my
flesh
will
be
made
perfect
in
the
resurrection
verse
for
we
are
all
the
children
of
god
by
faith
in
christ
jesus
paul
as
a
true
apostle
of
faith
always
has
the
word
faith
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
by
faith
says
he
we
are
the
children
of
god
the
law
can
not
beget
children
of
god
it
can
not
regenerate
us
it
can
only
remind
us
of
the
old
birth
by
which
we
were
born
into
the
kingdom
of
the
devil
the
best
the
law
can
do
for
us
is
to
prepare
us
for
a
new
birth
through
faith
in
christ
jesus
faith
in
christ
regenerates
us
into
the
children
of
god
john
bears
witness
to
this
in
his
gospel
as
many
as
received
him
to
them
gave
he
power
to
become
the
sons
of
god
even
to
them
that
believe
on
his
name
john
what
tongue
of
man
or
angel
can
adequately
extol
the
mercy
of
god
toward
us
miserable
sinners
in
that
he
adopted
us
for
his
own
children
and
with
his
son
by
the
simple
means
of
faith
in
christ
jesus
verse
for
as
many
of
you
as
have
been
baptized
into
christ
have
put
on
christ
to
put
on
christ
may
be
understood
in
two
ways
according
to
the
law
and
according
to
the
gospel
according
to
the
law
as
in
romans
put
ye
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
which
means
to
follow
the
example
of
christ
to
put
on
christ
according
to
the
gospel
means
to
clothe
oneself
with
the
righteousness
wisdom
power
life
and
spirit
of
christ
by
nature
we
are
clad
in
the
garb
of
adam
this
garb
paul
likes
to
call
the
old
man
before
we
can
become
the
children
of
god
this
old
man
must
be
put
off
as
paul
says
ephesians
the
garment
of
adam
must
come
off
like
soiled
clothes
of
course
it
is
not
as
simple
as
changing
clothes
but
god
makes
it
simple
he
clothes
us
with
the
righteousness
of
christ
by
means
of
baptism
as
the
apostle
says
in
this
verse
as
many
of
you
as
have
been
baptized
into
christ
have
put
on
christ
with
this
change
of
garments
a
new
birth
a
new
life
stirs
in
us
new
affections
toward
god
spring
up
in
the
heart
new
determinations
affect
our
will
all
this
is
to
put
on
christ
according
to
the
gospel
needless
to
say
when
we
have
put
on
the
robe
of
the
righteousness
of
christ
we
must
not
forget
to
put
on
also
the
mantle
of
the
imitation
of
christ
verse
there
is
neither
jew
nor
greek
there
is
neither
bond
nor
free
there
is
neither
male
nor
female
for
ye
are
all
one
in
christ
jesus
the
list
might
be
extended
indefinitely
there
is
neither
preacher
nor
hearer
neither
teacher
nor
scholar
neither
master
nor
servant
etc
in
the
matter
of
salvation
rank
learning
righteousness
influence
count
for
nothing
with
this
statement
paul
deals
a
death
blow
to
the
law
when
a
person
has
put
on
christ
nothing
else
matters
whether
a
person
is
a
jew
a
punctilious
and
circumcised
observer
of
the
law
of
moses
or
whether
a
person
is
a
noble
and
wise
greek
does
not
matter
circumstances
personal
worth
character
achievements
have
no
bearing
upon
justification
before
god
they
count
for
nothing
what
counts
is
that
we
put
on
christ
whether
a
servant
performs
his
duties
well
whether
those
who
are
in
authority
govern
wisely
whether
a
man
marries
provides
for
his
family
and
is
an
honest
citizen
whether
a
woman
is
chaste
obedient
to
her
husband
and
a
good
mother
all
these
advantages
do
not
qualify
a
person
for
salvation
these
virtues
are
commendable
of
course
but
they
do
not
count
points
for
justification
all
the
best
laws
ceremonies
religions
and
deeds
of
the
world
can
not
take
away
sin
guilt
can
not
dispatch
death
can
not
purchase
life
there
is
much
disparity
among
men
in
the
world
but
there
is
no
such
disparity
before
god
for
all
have
sinned
and
come
short
of
the
glory
of
god
romans
let
the
jews
let
the
greeks
let
the
whole
world
keep
silent
in
the
presence
of
god
those
who
are
justified
are
justified
by
christ
without
faith
in
christ
the
jew
with
his
laws
the
monk
with
his
holy
orders
the
greek
with
his
wisdom
the
servant
with
his
obedience
shall
perish
forever
verse
for
ye
are
all
one
in
christ
jesus
there
is
much
imparity
among
men
in
the
world
and
it
is
a
good
thing
if
the
woman
would
change
places
with
the
man
if
the
son
would
change
places
with
the
father
the
servant
with
the
master
nothing
but
confusion
would
result
in
christ
however
all
are
equal
we
all
have
one
and
the
same
gospel
one
faith
one
baptism
one
god
and
father
of
all
one
christ
and
savior
of
all
the
christ
of
peter
paul
and
all
the
saints
is
our
christ
paul
can
always
be
depended
on
to
add
the
conditional
clause
in
christ
jesus
if
we
lose
sight
of
christ
we
lose
out
verse
and
if
ye
be
christ
then
are
ye
abraham
seed
and
heirs
according
to
the
promise
if
ye
be
christ
means
if
you
believe
in
christ
if
you
believe
in
christ
then
are
you
the
children
of
abraham
indeed
through
our
faith
in
christ
abraham
gains
paternity
over
us
and
over
the
nations
of
the
earth
according
to
the
promise
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
be
blessed
through
faith
we
belong
to
christ
and
christ
to
us
chapter
verse
now
i
say
that
the
heir
as
long
as
he
is
a
child
differeth
nothing
from
a
servant
though
he
be
lord
of
all
verse
but
is
under
tutors
and
governors
until
the
time
appointed
of
the
father
the
apostle
had
apparently
finished
his
discourse
on
justification
when
this
illustration
of
the
youthful
heir
occurred
to
him
he
throws
it
in
for
good
measure
he
knows
that
plain
people
are
sooner
impressed
by
an
apt
illustration
than
by
learned
discussion
i
want
to
give
you
another
illustration
from
everyday
life
he
writes
to
the
galatians
as
long
as
an
heir
is
under
age
he
is
treated
very
much
like
a
servant
he
is
not
permitted
to
order
his
own
affairs
he
is
kept
under
constant
surveillance
such
discipline
is
good
for
him
otherwise
he
would
waste
his
inheritance
in
no
time
this
discipline
however
is
not
to
last
forever
it
is
to
last
only
until
time
appointed
of
the
father
verse
even
so
we
when
we
were
children
were
in
bondage
under
the
elements
of
the
world
as
children
of
the
law
we
were
treated
like
servants
and
prisoners
we
were
oppressed
and
condemned
by
the
law
but
the
tyranny
of
the
law
is
not
to
last
forever
it
is
to
last
only
until
the
time
appointed
of
the
father
until
christ
came
and
redeemed
us
verse
under
the
elements
of
the
world
by
the
elements
of
the
world
the
apostle
does
not
understand
the
physical
elements
as
some
have
thought
in
calling
the
law
the
elements
of
the
world
paul
means
to
say
that
the
law
is
something
material
mundane
earthly
it
may
restrain
evil
but
it
does
not
deliver
from
sin
the
law
does
not
justify
it
does
not
bring
a
person
to
heaven
i
do
not
obtain
eternal
life
because
i
do
not
kill
commit
adultery
steal
etc
such
mere
outward
decency
does
not
constitute
christianity
the
heathen
observe
the
same
restraints
to
avoid
punishment
or
to
secure
the
advantages
of
a
good
reputation
in
the
last
analysis
such
restraint
is
simple
hypocrisy
when
the
law
exercises
its
higher
function
it
accuses
and
condemns
the
conscience
all
these
effects
of
the
law
can
not
be
called
divine
or
heavenly
these
effects
are
elements
of
the
world
in
calling
the
law
the
elements
of
the
world
paul
refers
to
the
whole
law
principally
to
the
ceremonial
law
which
dealt
with
external
matters
as
meat
drink
dress
places
times
feasts
cleansings
sacrifices
etc
these
are
mundane
matters
which
can
not
save
the
sinner
ceremonial
laws
are
like
the
statutes
of
governments
dealing
with
purely
civil
matters
as
commerce
inheritance
etc
as
for
the
pope
church
laws
forbidding
marriage
and
meats
paul
calls
them
elsewhere
the
doctrines
of
devils
you
would
not
call
such
laws
elements
of
heaven
the
law
of
moses
deals
with
mundane
matters
it
holds
the
mirror
to
the
evil
which
is
in
the
world
by
revealing
the
evil
that
is
in
us
it
creates
a
longing
in
the
heart
for
the
better
things
of
god
the
law
forces
us
into
the
arms
of
christ
who
is
the
end
of
the
law
for
righteousness
to
every
one
that
believeth
romans
christ
relieves
the
conscience
of
the
law
in
so
far
as
the
law
impels
us
to
christ
it
renders
excellent
service
i
do
not
mean
to
give
the
impression
that
the
law
should
be
despised
neither
does
paul
intend
to
leave
that
impression
the
law
ought
to
be
honored
but
when
it
is
a
matter
of
justification
before
god
paul
had
to
speak
disparagingly
of
the
law
because
the
law
has
nothing
to
do
with
justification
if
it
thrusts
its
nose
into
the
business
of
justification
we
must
talk
harshly
to
the
law
to
keep
it
in
its
place
the
conscience
ought
not
to
be
on
speaking
terms
with
the
law
the
conscience
ought
to
know
only
christ
to
say
this
is
easy
but
in
times
of
trial
when
the
conscience
writhes
in
the
presence
of
god
it
is
not
so
easy
to
do
as
such
times
we
are
to
believe
in
christ
as
if
there
were
no
law
or
sin
anywhere
but
only
christ
we
ought
to
say
to
the
law
mister
law
i
do
not
get
you
you
stutter
so
much
i
do
think
that
you
have
anything
to
say
to
me
when
it
is
not
a
question
of
salvation
or
justification
with
us
we
are
to
think
highly
of
the
law
and
call
it
holy
just
and
good
romans
the
law
is
of
no
comfort
to
a
stricken
conscience
therefore
it
should
not
be
allowed
to
rule
in
our
conscience
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
christ
paid
so
great
a
price
to
deliver
the
conscience
from
the
tyranny
of
the
law
let
us
understand
that
the
law
and
christ
are
impossible
bedfellows
the
law
must
leave
the
bed
of
the
conscience
which
is
so
narrow
that
it
can
not
hold
two
as
isaiah
says
chapter
verse
only
paul
among
the
apostles
calls
the
law
the
elements
of
the
world
weak
and
beggarly
elements
the
strength
of
sin
the
letter
that
killeth
etc
the
other
apostles
do
not
speak
so
slightingly
of
the
law
those
who
want
to
be
scholars
in
the
school
of
christ
want
to
pick
up
the
language
of
paul
christ
called
him
a
chosen
vessel
and
equipped
with
a
facility
of
expression
far
above
that
of
the
other
apostles
that
he
as
the
chosen
vessel
should
establish
the
doctrine
of
justification
in
words
verses
but
when
the
fullness
of
the
time
was
come
god
sent
forth
his
son
made
of
a
woman
made
under
the
law
to
redeem
them
that
were
under
the
law
the
fullness
of
the
time
means
when
the
time
of
the
law
was
fulfilled
and
christ
was
revealed
note
how
paul
explains
christ
christ
says
he
is
the
son
of
god
and
the
son
of
a
woman
he
submitted
himself
under
the
law
to
redeem
us
who
were
under
the
law
in
these
words
the
apostle
explains
the
person
and
office
of
christ
his
person
is
divine
and
human
god
sent
forth
his
son
made
of
a
woman
christ
therefore
is
true
god
and
true
man
christ
office
the
apostle
describes
in
the
words
made
under
the
law
to
redeem
them
that
were
under
the
law
paul
calls
the
virgin
mary
a
woman
this
has
been
frequently
deplored
even
by
some
of
the
ancient
fathers
who
felt
that
paul
should
have
written
virgin
instead
of
woman
but
paul
is
now
treating
of
faith
and
christian
righteousness
of
the
person
and
office
of
christ
not
of
the
virginity
of
mary
the
inestimable
mercy
of
god
is
sufficiently
set
forth
by
the
fact
that
his
son
was
born
of
a
woman
the
more
general
term
woman
indicates
that
christ
was
born
a
true
man
paul
does
not
say
that
christ
was
born
of
man
and
woman
but
only
of
woman
that
he
has
a
virgin
in
mind
is
obvious
this
passage
furthermore
declares
that
christ
purpose
in
coming
was
the
abolition
of
the
law
not
with
the
intention
of
laying
down
new
laws
but
to
redeem
them
that
were
under
the
law
christ
himself
declared
i
judge
no
man
john
again
i
came
not
to
judge
the
world
but
to
save
the
world
john
in
other
words
i
came
not
to
bring
more
laws
or
to
judge
men
according
to
the
existing
law
i
have
a
higher
and
better
office
i
came
to
judge
and
to
condemn
the
law
so
that
it
may
no
more
judge
and
condemn
the
world
how
did
christ
manage
to
redeem
us
he
was
made
under
the
law
when
christ
came
he
found
us
all
in
prison
what
did
he
do
about
it
although
he
was
the
lord
of
the
law
he
voluntarily
placed
himself
under
the
law
and
permitted
it
to
exercise
dominion
over
him
indeed
to
accuse
and
to
condemn
him
when
the
law
takes
us
into
judgment
it
has
a
perfect
right
to
do
so
for
we
are
by
nature
the
children
of
wrath
even
as
others
eph
christ
however
did
no
sin
neither
was
guile
found
in
his
mouth
i
pet
hence
the
law
had
no
jurisdiction
over
him
yet
the
law
treated
this
innocent
just
and
blessed
lamb
of
god
as
cruelly
as
it
treated
us
it
accused
him
of
blasphemy
and
treason
it
made
him
guilty
of
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
it
overwhelmed
him
with
such
anguish
of
soul
that
his
sweat
was
as
blood
the
law
condemned
him
to
the
shameful
death
on
the
cross
it
is
truly
amazing
that
the
law
had
the
effrontery
to
turn
upon
its
divine
author
and
that
without
a
show
of
right
for
its
insolence
the
law
in
turn
was
arraigned
before
the
judgment
seat
of
god
and
condemned
christ
might
have
overcome
the
law
by
an
exercise
of
his
omnipotent
authority
over
the
law
instead
he
humbled
himself
under
the
law
for
and
together
with
them
that
were
under
the
law
he
gave
the
law
license
to
accuse
and
condemn
him
his
present
mastery
over
the
law
was
obtained
by
virtue
of
his
sonship
and
his
substitutionary
victory
thus
christ
banished
the
law
from
the
conscience
it
dare
no
longer
banish
us
from
god
for
that
matter
the
law
continues
to
reveal
sin
it
still
raises
its
voice
in
condemnation
but
the
conscience
finds
quick
relief
in
the
words
of
the
apostle
christ
has
redeemed
us
from
the
law
the
conscience
can
now
hold
its
head
high
and
say
to
the
law
you
are
not
so
holy
yourself
you
crucified
the
son
of
god
that
was
an
awful
thing
for
you
to
do
you
have
lost
your
influence
forever
the
words
christ
was
made
under
the
law
are
worth
all
the
attention
we
can
bestow
on
them
they
declare
that
the
son
of
god
did
not
only
fulfill
one
or
two
easy
requirements
of
the
law
but
that
he
endured
all
the
tortures
of
the
law
the
law
brought
all
its
fright
to
bear
upon
christ
until
he
experienced
anguish
and
terror
such
as
nobody
else
ever
experienced
his
bloody
sweat
his
need
of
angelic
comfort
his
tremulous
prayer
in
the
garden
his
lamentation
on
the
cross
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
bear
eloquent
witness
to
the
sting
of
the
law
he
suffered
to
redeem
them
that
were
under
the
law
the
roman
conception
of
christ
as
a
mere
lawgiver
more
stringent
than
moses
is
quite
contrary
to
paul
teaching
christ
according
to
paul
was
not
an
agent
of
the
law
but
a
patient
of
the
law
he
was
not
a
but
a
true
enough
christ
also
taught
and
expounded
the
law
but
it
was
incidental
it
was
a
sideline
with
him
he
did
not
come
into
the
world
for
the
purpose
of
teaching
the
law
as
little
as
it
was
the
purpose
of
his
coming
to
perform
miracles
teaching
the
law
and
performing
miracles
did
not
constitute
his
unique
mission
to
the
world
the
prophets
also
taught
the
law
and
performed
miracles
in
fact
according
to
the
promise
of
christ
the
apostles
performed
greater
miracles
than
christ
himself
john
the
true
purpose
of
christ
coming
was
the
abolition
of
the
law
of
sin
and
of
death
if
we
think
of
christ
as
paul
here
depicts
him
we
shall
never
go
wrong
we
shall
never
be
in
danger
of
misconstruing
the
meaning
of
the
law
we
shall
understand
that
the
law
does
not
justify
we
shall
understand
why
a
christian
observes
laws
for
the
peace
of
the
world
out
of
gratitude
to
god
and
for
a
good
example
that
others
may
be
attracted
to
the
gospel
verse
that
we
might
receive
the
adoption
of
sons
paul
still
has
for
his
text
genesis
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
be
blessed
in
the
course
of
his
epistle
he
calls
this
promise
of
the
blessing
righteousness
life
deliverance
from
the
law
the
testament
etc
now
he
also
calls
the
promise
of
blessing
the
adoption
of
sons
the
inheritance
of
everlasting
life
what
ever
induced
god
to
adopt
us
for
his
children
and
heirs
what
claim
can
men
who
are
subservient
to
sin
subject
to
the
curse
of
the
law
and
worthy
of
everlasting
death
have
on
god
and
eternal
life
that
god
adopted
us
is
due
to
the
merit
of
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
who
humbled
himself
under
the
law
and
redeemed
us
sinners
verse
and
because
ye
are
sons
god
hath
sent
forth
the
spirit
of
his
son
into
your
hearts
in
the
early
church
the
holy
spirit
was
sent
forth
in
visible
form
he
descended
upon
christ
in
the
form
of
a
dove
matt
and
in
the
likeness
of
fire
upon
the
apostles
and
other
believers
acts
this
visible
outpouring
of
the
holy
spirit
was
necessary
to
the
establishment
of
the
early
church
as
were
also
the
miracles
that
accompanied
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
paul
explained
the
purpose
of
these
miraculous
gifts
of
the
spirit
in
i
corinthians
tongues
are
for
a
sign
not
to
them
that
believe
but
to
them
that
believe
not
once
the
church
had
been
established
and
properly
advertised
by
these
miracles
the
visible
appearance
of
the
holy
ghost
ceased
next
the
holy
ghost
is
sent
forth
into
the
hearts
of
the
believers
as
here
stated
god
sent
the
spirit
of
his
son
into
your
hearts
this
sending
is
accomplished
by
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
through
which
the
holy
spirit
inspires
us
with
fervor
and
light
with
new
judgment
new
desires
and
new
motives
this
happy
innovation
is
not
a
derivative
of
reason
or
personal
development
but
solely
the
gift
and
operation
of
the
holy
ghost
this
renewal
by
the
holy
spirit
may
not
be
conspicuous
to
the
world
but
it
is
patent
to
us
by
our
better
judgment
our
improved
speech
and
our
unashamed
confession
of
christ
formerly
we
did
not
confess
christ
to
be
our
only
merit
as
we
do
now
in
the
light
of
the
gospel
why
then
should
we
feel
bad
if
the
world
looks
upon
us
as
ravagers
of
religion
and
insurgents
against
constituted
authority
we
confess
christ
and
our
conscience
approves
of
it
then
too
we
live
in
the
fear
of
god
if
we
sin
we
sin
not
on
purpose
but
unwittingly
and
we
are
sorry
for
it
sin
sticks
in
our
flesh
and
the
flesh
gets
us
into
sin
even
after
we
have
been
imbued
by
the
holy
ghost
outwardly
there
is
no
great
difference
between
a
christian
and
any
honest
man
the
activities
of
a
christian
are
not
sensational
he
performs
his
duty
according
to
his
vocation
he
takes
good
care
of
his
family
and
is
kind
and
helpful
to
others
such
homely
everyday
performances
are
not
much
admired
but
the
exercises
of
the
monks
draw
great
applause
holy
works
you
know
only
the
acts
of
a
christian
are
truly
good
and
acceptable
to
god
because
they
are
done
in
faith
with
a
cheerful
heart
out
of
gratitude
to
christ
we
ought
to
have
no
misgivings
about
whether
the
holy
ghost
dwells
in
us
we
are
the
temple
of
the
holy
ghost
i
cor
when
we
have
a
love
for
the
word
of
god
and
gladly
hear
talk
write
and
think
of
christ
we
are
to
know
that
this
inclination
toward
christ
is
the
gift
and
work
of
the
holy
ghost
where
you
come
across
contempt
for
the
word
of
god
there
is
the
devil
we
meet
with
such
contempt
for
the
word
of
god
mostly
among
the
common
people
they
act
as
though
the
word
of
god
does
not
concern
them
wherever
you
find
a
love
for
the
word
thank
god
for
the
holy
spirit
who
infuses
this
love
into
the
hearts
of
men
we
never
come
by
this
love
naturally
neither
can
it
be
enforced
by
laws
it
is
the
gift
of
the
holy
spirit
the
roman
theologians
teach
that
no
man
can
know
for
a
certainty
whether
he
stands
in
the
favor
of
god
or
not
this
teaching
forms
one
of
the
chief
articles
of
their
faith
with
this
teaching
they
tormented
consciences
excommunicated
christ
from
the
church
and
limited
the
operations
of
the
holy
ghost
augustine
observed
that
every
man
is
certain
of
his
faith
if
he
has
faith
this
the
romanists
deny
god
forbid
they
exclaim
piously
that
i
should
ever
be
so
arrogant
as
to
think
that
i
stand
in
grace
that
i
am
holy
or
that
i
have
the
holy
ghost
we
ought
to
feel
sure
that
we
stand
in
the
grace
of
god
not
in
view
of
our
own
worthiness
but
through
the
good
services
of
christ
as
certain
as
we
are
that
christ
pleases
god
so
sure
ought
we
to
be
that
we
also
please
god
because
christ
is
in
us
and
although
we
daily
offend
god
by
our
sins
yet
as
often
as
we
sin
god
mercy
bends
over
us
therefore
sin
can
not
get
us
to
doubt
the
grace
of
god
our
certainty
is
of
christ
that
mighty
hero
who
overcame
the
law
sin
death
and
all
evils
so
long
as
he
sits
at
the
right
hand
of
god
to
intercede
for
us
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
anger
of
god
this
inner
assurance
of
the
grace
of
god
is
accompanied
by
outward
indications
such
as
gladly
to
hear
preach
praise
and
to
confess
christ
to
do
one
duty
in
the
station
in
which
god
has
placed
us
to
aid
the
needy
and
to
comfort
the
sorrowing
these
are
the
affidavits
of
the
holy
spirit
testifying
to
our
favorable
standing
with
god
if
we
could
be
fully
persuaded
that
we
are
in
the
good
grace
of
god
that
our
sins
are
forgiven
that
we
have
the
spirit
of
christ
that
we
are
the
beloved
children
of
god
we
would
be
ever
so
happy
and
grateful
to
god
but
because
we
often
feel
fear
and
doubt
we
can
not
come
to
that
happy
certainty
train
your
conscience
to
believe
that
god
approves
of
you
fight
it
out
with
doubt
gain
assurance
through
the
word
of
god
say
i
am
all
right
with
god
i
have
the
holy
ghost
christ
in
whom
i
do
believe
makes
me
worthy
i
gladly
hear
read
sing
and
write
of
him
i
would
like
nothing
better
than
that
christ
gospel
be
known
throughout
the
world
and
that
many
many
be
brought
to
faith
in
him
verse
crying
abba
father
paul
might
have
written
god
sent
forth
the
spirit
of
his
son
into
your
hearts
calling
abba
father
instead
he
wrote
crying
abba
father
in
the
eighth
chapter
of
the
epistle
to
the
romans
the
apostle
describes
this
crying
of
the
spirit
as
groanings
which
can
not
be
uttered
he
writes
in
the
verse
likewise
the
spirit
also
helpeth
our
infirmities
for
we
know
not
what
we
should
pray
for
as
we
ought
but
the
spirit
itself
maketh
intercession
for
us
with
groanings
which
can
not
be
uttered
the
fact
that
the
spirit
of
christ
in
our
hearts
cries
unto
god
and
makes
intercession
for
us
with
groanings
should
reassure
us
greatly
however
there
are
many
factors
that
prevent
such
full
reassurance
on
our
part
we
are
born
in
sin
to
doubt
the
good
will
of
god
is
an
inborn
suspicion
of
god
with
all
of
us
besides
the
devil
our
adversary
goeth
about
seeking
to
devour
us
by
roaring
god
is
angry
at
you
and
is
going
to
destroy
you
forever
in
all
these
difficulties
we
have
only
one
support
the
gospel
of
christ
to
hold
on
to
it
that
is
the
trick
christ
can
not
be
perceived
with
the
senses
we
can
not
see
him
the
heart
does
not
feel
his
helpful
presence
especially
in
times
of
trials
a
christian
feels
the
power
of
sin
the
infirmity
of
his
flesh
the
goading
darts
of
the
devil
the
agues
of
death
the
scowl
and
judgment
of
god
all
these
things
cry
out
against
us
the
law
scolds
us
sin
screams
at
us
death
thunders
at
us
the
devil
roars
at
us
in
the
midst
of
the
clamor
the
spirit
of
christ
cries
in
our
hearts
abba
father
and
this
little
cry
of
the
spirit
transcends
the
hullabaloo
of
the
law
sin
death
and
the
devil
and
finds
a
hearing
with
god
the
spirit
cries
in
us
because
of
our
weakness
because
of
our
infirmity
the
holy
ghost
is
sent
forth
into
our
hearts
to
pray
for
us
according
to
the
will
of
god
and
to
assure
us
of
the
grace
of
god
let
the
law
sin
and
the
devil
cry
out
against
us
until
their
outcry
fills
heaven
and
earth
the
spirit
of
god
outcries
them
all
our
feeble
groans
abba
father
will
be
heard
of
god
sooner
than
the
combined
racket
of
hell
sin
and
the
law
we
do
not
think
of
our
groanings
as
a
crying
it
is
so
faint
we
do
not
know
we
are
groaning
but
he
says
paul
that
searcheth
the
hearts
knoweth
what
is
the
mind
of
the
spirit
romans
to
this
searcher
of
hearts
our
feeble
groaning
as
it
seems
to
us
is
a
loud
shout
for
help
in
comparison
with
which
the
howls
of
hell
the
din
of
the
devil
the
yells
of
the
law
the
shouts
of
sin
are
like
so
many
whispers
in
the
fourteenth
chapter
of
exodus
the
lord
addresses
moses
at
the
red
sea
wherefore
criest
thou
unto
me
moses
had
not
cried
unto
the
lord
he
trembled
so
he
could
hardly
talk
his
faith
was
at
low
ebb
he
saw
the
people
of
israel
wedged
between
the
sea
and
the
approaching
armies
of
pharaoh
how
were
they
to
escape
moses
did
not
know
what
to
say
how
then
could
god
say
that
moses
was
crying
to
him
god
heard
the
groaning
heart
of
moses
and
the
groans
to
him
sounded
like
loud
shouts
for
help
god
is
quick
to
catch
the
sigh
of
the
heart
some
have
claimed
that
the
saints
are
without
infirmities
but
paul
says
the
spirit
helpeth
our
infirmities
and
maketh
intercession
for
us
with
groanings
which
can
not
be
uttered
we
need
the
help
of
the
holy
spirit
because
we
are
weak
and
infirm
and
the
holy
spirit
never
disappoints
us
confronted
by
the
armies
of
pharaoh
retreat
cut
off
by
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
moses
was
in
a
bad
spot
he
felt
himself
to
blame
the
devil
accused
him
these
people
will
all
perish
for
they
can
not
escape
and
you
are
to
blame
because
you
led
the
people
out
of
egypt
you
started
all
this
and
then
the
people
started
in
on
moses
because
there
were
no
graves
in
egypt
hast
thou
taken
us
away
to
die
in
the
wilderness
for
it
had
been
better
for
us
to
serve
the
egyptians
than
that
we
should
die
in
the
wilderness
ex
but
the
holy
ghost
was
in
moses
and
made
intercession
for
him
with
unutterable
groanings
sighings
unto
the
lord
o
lord
at
thy
commandment
have
i
led
forth
this
people
so
help
me
now
the
spirit
intercedes
for
us
not
in
many
words
or
long
prayers
but
with
groanings
with
little
sounds
like
abba
small
as
this
word
is
it
says
ever
so
much
it
says
my
father
i
am
in
great
trouble
and
you
seem
so
far
away
but
i
know
i
am
your
child
because
you
are
my
father
for
christ
sake
i
am
loved
by
you
because
of
the
beloved
this
one
little
word
abba
surpasses
the
eloquence
of
a
demosthenes
and
a
cicero
i
have
spent
much
time
on
this
verse
in
order
to
combat
the
cruel
teaching
of
the
roman
church
that
a
person
ought
to
be
kept
in
a
state
of
uncertainty
concerning
his
status
with
god
the
monasteries
recruit
the
youth
on
the
plea
that
their
holy
orders
will
assuredly
recruit
them
for
heaven
but
once
inside
the
monastery
the
recruits
are
told
to
doubt
the
promises
of
god
in
support
of
their
error
the
papists
quote
the
saying
of
solomon
the
righteous
and
the
wise
and
their
works
are
in
the
hand
of
god
no
man
knoweth
either
love
or
hatred
by
all
that
is
before
them
eccles
they
take
this
hatred
to
mean
the
wrath
of
god
to
come
others
take
it
to
mean
god
present
anger
none
of
them
seem
to
understand
this
passage
from
solomon
on
every
page
the
scriptures
urge
us
to
believe
that
god
is
merciful
loving
and
patient
that
he
is
faithful
and
true
and
that
he
keeps
his
promises
all
the
promises
of
god
were
fulfilled
in
the
gift
of
his
son
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
everlasting
life
the
gospel
is
reassurance
for
sinners
yet
this
one
saying
from
solomon
misinterpreted
at
that
is
made
to
count
for
more
than
all
the
many
promises
of
all
the
scriptures
if
our
opponents
are
so
uncertain
about
their
status
with
god
and
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
conscience
ought
to
be
kept
in
a
state
of
doubt
why
is
it
that
they
persecute
us
as
vile
heretics
when
it
comes
to
persecuting
us
they
do
not
seem
to
be
in
doubt
and
uncertainty
one
minute
let
us
not
fail
to
thank
god
for
delivering
us
from
the
doctrine
of
doubt
the
gospel
commands
us
to
look
away
from
our
own
good
works
to
the
promises
of
god
in
christ
the
mediator
the
pope
commands
us
to
look
away
from
the
promises
of
god
in
christ
to
our
own
merit
no
wonder
they
are
the
eternal
prey
of
doubt
and
despair
we
depend
upon
god
for
salvation
no
wonder
that
our
doctrine
is
certified
because
it
does
not
rest
in
our
own
strength
our
own
conscience
our
own
feelings
our
own
person
our
own
works
it
is
built
on
a
better
foundation
it
is
built
on
the
promises
and
truth
of
god
besides
the
passage
from
solomon
does
not
treat
of
the
hatred
and
love
of
god
towards
men
it
merely
rebukes
the
ingratitude
of
men
the
more
deserving
a
person
is
the
less
he
is
appreciated
often
those
who
should
be
his
best
friends
are
his
worst
enemies
those
who
least
deserve
the
praise
of
the
world
get
most
david
was
a
holy
man
and
a
good
king
nevertheless
he
was
chased
from
his
own
country
the
prophets
christ
the
apostles
were
slain
solomon
in
this
passage
does
not
speak
of
the
love
and
hatred
of
god
but
of
love
and
hatred
among
men
as
though
solomon
wanted
to
say
there
are
many
good
and
wise
men
whom
god
uses
for
the
advancement
of
mankind
seldom
if
ever
are
their
efforts
crowned
with
gratitude
they
are
usually
repaid
with
hatred
and
ingratitude
we
are
being
treated
that
way
we
thought
we
would
find
favor
with
men
for
bringing
them
the
gospel
of
peace
life
and
eternal
salvation
instead
of
favor
we
found
fury
at
first
yes
many
were
delighted
with
our
doctrine
and
received
it
gladly
we
counted
them
as
our
friends
and
brethren
and
were
happy
to
think
that
they
would
help
us
in
sowing
the
seed
of
the
gospel
but
they
revealed
themselves
as
false
brethren
and
deadly
enemies
of
the
gospel
if
you
experience
the
ingratitude
of
men
do
let
it
get
you
down
say
with
christ
they
hated
me
without
cause
and
for
my
love
they
are
my
adversaries
but
i
give
myself
unto
prayer
ps
let
us
never
doubt
the
mercy
of
god
in
christ
jesus
but
make
up
our
minds
that
god
is
pleased
with
us
that
he
looks
after
us
and
that
we
have
the
holy
spirit
who
prays
for
us
verse
wherefore
thou
art
no
more
a
servant
but
a
son
this
sentence
clinches
paul
argument
he
says
with
the
holy
spirit
in
our
hearts
crying
father
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
god
has
adopted
us
for
his
children
and
that
our
subjection
to
the
law
has
come
to
an
end
we
are
now
the
free
children
of
god
we
may
now
say
to
the
law
mister
law
you
have
lost
your
throne
to
christ
i
am
free
now
and
a
son
of
god
you
can
not
curse
me
any
more
do
not
permit
the
law
to
lie
in
your
conscience
your
conscience
belongs
to
christ
let
christ
be
in
it
and
not
the
law
as
the
children
of
god
we
are
the
heirs
of
his
eternal
heaven
what
a
wonderful
gift
heaven
is
man
heart
can
not
conceive
much
less
describe
until
we
enter
upon
our
heavenly
inheritance
we
are
only
to
have
our
little
faith
to
go
by
to
man
reason
our
faith
looks
rather
forlorn
but
because
our
faith
rests
on
the
promises
of
the
infinite
god
his
promises
are
also
infinite
so
much
so
that
nothing
can
accuse
or
condemn
us
verse
and
if
a
son
then
an
heir
of
god
through
christ
a
son
is
an
heir
not
by
virtue
of
high
accomplishments
but
by
virtue
of
his
birth
he
is
a
mere
recipient
his
birth
makes
him
an
heir
not
his
labors
in
exactly
the
same
way
we
obtain
the
eternal
gifts
of
righteousness
resurrection
and
everlasting
life
we
obtain
them
not
as
agents
but
as
beneficiaries
we
are
the
children
and
heirs
of
god
through
faith
in
christ
we
have
christ
to
thank
for
everything
we
are
not
the
heirs
of
some
rich
and
mighty
man
but
heirs
of
god
the
almighty
creator
of
all
things
if
a
person
could
fully
appreciate
what
it
means
to
be
a
son
and
heir
of
god
he
would
rate
the
might
and
wealth
of
nations
small
change
in
comparison
with
his
heavenly
inheritance
what
is
the
world
to
him
who
has
heaven
no
wonder
paul
greatly
desired
to
depart
and
to
be
with
christ
nothing
would
be
more
welcome
to
us
than
early
death
knowing
that
it
would
spell
the
end
of
all
our
miseries
and
the
beginning
of
all
our
happiness
yes
if
a
person
could
perfectly
believe
this
he
would
not
long
remain
alive
the
anticipation
of
his
joy
would
kill
him
but
the
law
of
the
members
strives
against
the
law
of
the
mind
and
makes
perfect
joy
and
faith
impossible
we
need
the
continued
help
and
comfort
of
the
holy
spirit
we
need
his
prayers
paul
himself
cried
out
o
wretched
man
that
i
am
who
shall
deliver
me
from
the
body
of
this
death
the
body
of
this
death
spoiled
the
joy
of
his
spirit
he
did
not
always
entertain
the
sweet
and
glad
expectation
of
his
heavenly
inheritance
he
often
felt
miserable
this
goes
to
show
how
hard
it
is
to
believe
faith
is
feeble
because
the
flesh
wars
against
the
spirit
if
we
could
have
perfect
faith
our
loathing
for
this
life
in
the
world
would
be
complete
we
would
not
be
so
careful
about
this
life
we
would
not
be
so
attached
to
the
world
and
the
things
of
the
world
we
would
not
feel
so
good
when
we
have
them
we
would
not
feel
so
bad
when
we
lose
them
we
would
be
far
more
humble
and
patient
and
kind
but
our
faith
is
weak
because
our
spirit
is
weak
in
this
life
we
can
have
only
the
of
the
spirit
as
paul
says
verse
through
christ
the
apostle
always
has
christ
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
he
foresaw
that
nothing
would
be
less
known
in
the
world
some
day
than
the
gospel
of
christ
therefore
he
talks
of
christ
continually
as
often
as
he
speaks
of
righteousness
grace
the
promise
the
adoption
and
the
inheritance
of
heaven
he
adds
the
words
in
christ
or
through
christ
to
show
that
these
blessings
are
not
to
be
had
by
the
law
or
the
deeds
of
the
law
much
less
by
our
own
exertions
or
by
the
observance
of
human
traditions
but
only
by
and
through
and
in
christ
verses
and
howbeit
then
when
ye
knew
not
god
ye
did
service
unto
them
which
by
nature
are
no
gods
but
now
after
that
ye
have
known
god
or
rather
are
known
of
god
how
turn
ye
again
to
the
weak
and
beggarly
elements
whereunto
ye
desire
again
to
be
in
bondage
this
concludes
paul
discourse
on
justification
from
now
to
the
end
of
the
epistle
the
apostle
writes
mostly
of
christian
conduct
but
before
he
follows
up
his
doctrinal
discourse
with
practical
precepts
he
once
more
reproves
the
galatians
he
is
deeply
displeased
with
them
for
relinquishing
their
divine
doctrine
he
tells
them
you
have
taken
on
teachers
who
intend
to
recommit
you
to
the
law
by
my
doctrine
i
called
you
out
of
the
darkness
of
ignorance
into
the
wonderful
light
of
the
knowledge
of
god
i
led
you
out
of
bondage
into
the
freedom
of
the
sons
of
god
not
by
the
prescription
of
laws
but
by
the
gift
of
heavenly
and
eternal
blessings
through
christ
jesus
how
could
you
so
soon
forsake
the
light
and
return
to
darkness
how
could
you
so
quickly
stray
from
grace
into
the
law
from
freedom
into
bondage
the
example
of
the
galatians
of
anabaptists
and
other
sectarians
in
our
day
bears
testimony
to
the
ease
with
which
faith
may
be
lost
we
take
great
pains
in
setting
forth
the
doctrine
of
faith
by
preaching
and
by
writing
we
are
careful
to
apply
the
gospel
and
the
law
in
their
proper
turn
yet
we
make
little
headway
because
the
devil
seduces
people
into
misbelief
by
taking
christ
out
of
their
sight
and
focusing
their
eyes
upon
the
law
but
why
does
paul
accuse
the
galatians
of
reverting
to
the
weak
and
beggarly
elements
of
the
law
when
they
never
had
the
law
why
does
he
not
say
to
them
at
one
time
you
galatians
did
not
know
god
you
then
served
idols
that
were
no
gods
but
now
that
you
have
come
to
know
the
true
god
why
do
you
go
back
to
the
worship
of
idols
paul
seems
to
identify
their
defection
from
the
gospel
to
the
law
with
their
former
idolatry
indeed
he
does
whoever
gives
up
the
article
of
justification
does
not
know
the
true
god
it
is
one
and
the
same
thing
whether
a
person
reverts
to
the
law
or
to
the
worship
of
idols
when
the
article
of
justification
is
lost
nothing
remains
except
error
hypocrisy
godlessness
and
idolatry
god
will
and
can
be
known
in
no
other
way
than
in
and
through
christ
according
to
the
statement
of
john
the
only
begotten
son
which
is
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
he
hath
declared
him
christ
is
the
only
means
whereby
we
can
know
god
and
his
will
in
christ
we
perceive
that
god
is
not
a
cruel
judge
but
a
most
loving
and
merciful
father
who
to
bless
and
to
save
us
spared
not
his
own
son
but
gave
him
up
for
us
all
this
is
truly
to
know
god
those
who
do
not
know
god
in
christ
arrive
at
this
erroneous
conclusion
i
will
serve
god
in
such
and
such
a
way
i
will
join
this
or
that
order
i
will
be
active
in
this
or
that
charitable
endeavor
god
will
sanction
my
good
intentions
and
reward
me
with
everlasting
life
for
is
he
not
a
merciful
and
generous
father
who
gives
good
things
even
to
the
unworthy
and
ungrateful
how
much
more
will
he
grant
unto
me
everlasting
life
as
a
due
payment
in
return
for
my
many
good
deeds
and
merits
this
is
the
religion
of
reason
this
is
the
natural
religion
of
the
world
the
natural
man
receiveth
not
the
things
of
the
spirit
of
god
i
cor
there
is
none
that
understandeth
there
is
none
that
seeketh
after
god
romans
hence
there
is
really
no
difference
between
a
jew
a
mohammedan
and
any
other
old
or
new
heretic
there
may
be
a
difference
of
persons
places
rites
religions
ceremonies
but
as
far
as
their
fundamental
beliefs
are
concerned
they
are
all
alike
is
it
therefore
not
extreme
folly
for
rome
and
the
mohammedans
to
fight
each
other
about
religion
how
about
the
monks
why
should
one
monk
want
to
be
accounted
more
holy
than
another
monk
because
of
some
silly
ceremony
when
all
the
time
their
basic
beliefs
are
asnmuch
alike
as
one
egg
is
like
the
other
they
all
imagine
if
we
do
this
or
that
work
god
will
have
mercy
on
us
if
not
god
will
be
angry
god
never
promised
to
save
anybody
for
his
religious
observance
of
ceremonies
and
ordinances
those
who
rely
upon
such
things
do
serve
a
god
but
it
is
their
own
invention
of
a
god
and
not
the
true
god
the
true
god
has
this
to
say
no
religion
pleases
me
whereby
the
father
is
not
glorified
through
his
son
jesus
all
who
give
their
faith
to
this
son
of
mine
to
them
i
am
god
and
father
i
accept
justify
and
save
them
all
others
abide
under
my
curse
because
they
worship
creatures
instead
of
me
without
the
doctrine
of
justification
there
can
be
only
ignorance
of
god
those
who
refuse
to
be
justified
by
christ
are
idolaters
they
remain
under
the
law
sin
death
and
the
power
of
the
devil
everything
they
do
is
wrong
nowadays
there
are
many
such
idolaters
who
want
to
be
counted
among
the
true
confessors
of
the
gospel
they
may
even
teach
that
men
are
delivered
from
their
sins
by
the
death
of
christ
but
because
they
attach
more
importance
to
charity
than
to
faith
in
christ
they
dishonor
him
and
pervert
his
word
they
do
not
serve
the
true
god
but
an
idol
of
their
own
invention
the
true
god
has
never
yet
smiled
upon
a
person
for
his
charity
or
virtues
but
only
for
the
sake
of
christ
merits
the
objection
is
frequently
raised
that
the
bible
commands
that
we
should
love
god
with
all
our
heart
true
enough
but
because
god
commands
it
it
does
not
follow
that
we
do
it
if
we
could
love
god
with
all
our
heart
we
should
undoubtedly
be
justified
by
our
obedience
for
it
is
written
which
if
a
man
do
he
shall
live
in
them
lev
but
now
comes
the
gospel
and
says
because
you
do
not
do
these
things
you
can
not
live
in
them
the
words
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
require
perfect
obedience
perfect
fear
perfect
trust
and
perfect
love
but
where
are
the
people
who
can
render
perfection
hence
this
commandment
instead
of
justifying
men
only
accuses
and
condemns
them
christ
is
the
end
of
the
law
for
righteousness
to
every
one
that
believeth
romans
how
may
these
two
contradictory
statements
of
the
apostle
ye
knew
not
god
and
ye
worshipped
god
be
reconciled
i
answer
by
nature
all
men
know
that
there
is
a
god
because
that
which
may
be
known
of
god
is
manifest
in
them
for
god
hath
showed
it
unto
them
for
the
invisible
things
of
him
from
the
creation
of
the
world
are
clearly
seen
romans
furthermore
the
different
religions
to
be
found
among
all
nations
at
all
times
bear
witness
to
the
fact
that
all
men
have
a
certain
intuitive
knowledge
of
god
if
all
men
know
god
how
can
paul
say
that
the
galatians
did
not
know
god
prior
to
the
hearing
of
the
gospel
i
answer
there
is
a
twofold
knowledge
of
god
general
and
particular
all
men
have
the
general
and
instinctive
recognition
that
there
is
a
god
who
created
heaven
and
earth
who
is
just
and
holy
and
who
punishes
the
wicked
how
god
feels
about
us
what
his
intentions
are
what
he
will
do
for
us
or
how
he
will
save
us
that
men
can
not
know
instinctively
it
must
be
revealed
to
them
i
may
know
a
person
by
sight
and
still
not
know
him
because
i
do
not
know
how
he
feels
about
me
men
know
instinctively
that
there
is
a
god
but
what
his
will
is
toward
them
they
do
not
know
it
is
written
there
is
none
that
understandeth
god
romans
again
no
man
hath
seen
god
john
now
what
good
does
it
do
you
if
you
know
that
there
is
a
god
if
you
do
not
know
how
he
feels
about
you
or
what
he
wants
of
you
people
have
done
a
good
deal
of
guessing
the
jew
imagines
he
is
doing
the
will
of
god
if
he
concentrates
on
the
law
of
moses
the
mohammedan
thinks
his
koran
is
the
will
of
god
the
monk
fancies
he
is
doing
the
will
of
god
if
he
performs
his
vows
but
they
deceive
themselves
and
become
vain
in
their
imaginations
as
paul
says
romans
instead
of
worshipping
the
true
god
they
worship
the
vain
imaginations
of
their
foolish
hearts
what
paul
means
by
saying
to
the
galatians
when
ye
knew
not
god
is
simply
this
there
was
a
time
when
you
did
not
know
the
will
of
god
in
christ
but
you
worshipped
gods
of
your
own
invention
thinking
that
you
had
to
perform
this
or
that
labor
whether
you
understand
the
elements
of
the
world
to
mean
the
law
of
moses
or
the
religions
of
the
heathen
nations
it
makes
no
difference
those
who
lapse
from
the
gospel
to
the
law
are
no
better
off
than
those
who
lapse
from
grace
into
idolatry
without
christ
all
religion
is
idolatry
without
christ
men
will
entertain
false
ideas
about
god
call
their
ideas
what
you
like
the
laws
of
moses
the
ordinances
of
the
pope
the
koran
of
the
mohammedans
or
what
have
you
verse
but
now
after
that
ye
have
known
god
is
it
not
amazing
cries
paul
that
you
galatians
who
knew
god
intimately
by
the
hearing
of
the
gospel
should
all
of
a
sudden
revert
from
the
true
knowledge
of
his
will
in
which
i
thought
you
were
confirmed
to
the
weak
and
beggarly
elements
of
the
law
which
can
only
enslave
you
again
verse
or
rather
are
known
of
god
the
apostle
turns
the
foregoing
sentence
around
he
fears
the
galatians
have
lost
god
altogether
alas
he
cries
have
you
come
to
this
that
you
no
longer
know
god
what
else
am
i
to
think
nevertheless
god
knows
you
our
knowledge
of
god
is
rather
passive
than
active
god
knows
us
better
than
we
know
god
ye
are
known
of
god
means
that
god
brings
his
gospel
to
our
attention
and
endows
us
with
faith
and
the
holy
spirit
even
in
these
words
the
apostle
denies
the
possibility
of
our
knowing
god
by
the
performance
of
the
law
no
man
knoweth
who
the
father
is
but
the
son
and
he
to
whom
the
son
will
reveal
him
luke
by
his
knowledge
shall
my
righteous
servant
justify
many
for
he
shall
bear
their
iniquities
isaiah
the
apostle
frankly
expresses
his
surprise
to
the
galatians
that
they
who
had
known
god
intimately
through
the
gospel
should
so
easily
be
persuaded
by
the
false
apostles
to
return
to
the
weak
and
beggarly
elements
of
the
law
i
would
not
be
surprised
to
see
my
church
perverted
by
some
fanatic
through
one
or
two
sermons
we
are
no
better
than
the
apostles
who
had
to
witness
the
subversion
of
the
churches
which
they
had
planted
with
their
own
hands
nevertheless
christ
will
reign
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
that
miraculously
as
he
did
during
the
dark
ages
paul
seems
to
think
rather
ill
of
the
law
he
calls
it
the
elements
of
the
world
the
weak
and
beggarly
elements
of
the
world
was
it
not
irreverent
for
him
to
speak
that
way
about
the
holy
law
of
god
the
law
ought
to
prepare
the
way
of
christ
into
the
hearts
of
men
that
is
the
true
purpose
and
function
of
the
law
but
if
the
law
presumes
to
usurp
the
place
and
function
of
the
gospel
it
is
no
longer
the
holy
law
of
god
but
a
if
you
care
to
amplify
this
matter
you
may
add
the
observation
that
the
law
is
a
weak
and
beggarly
element
because
it
makes
people
weak
and
beggarly
the
law
has
no
power
and
affluence
to
make
men
strong
and
rich
before
god
to
seek
to
be
justified
by
the
law
amounts
to
the
same
thing
as
if
a
person
who
is
already
weak
and
feeble
should
try
to
find
strength
in
weakness
or
as
if
a
person
with
the
dropsy
should
seek
a
cure
by
exposing
himself
to
the
pestilence
or
as
if
a
leper
should
go
to
a
leper
and
a
beggar
to
a
beggar
to
find
health
and
wealth
those
who
seek
to
be
justified
by
the
law
grow
weaker
and
more
destitute
right
along
they
are
weak
and
bankrupt
to
begin
with
they
are
by
nature
the
children
of
wrath
yet
for
salvation
they
grasp
at
the
straw
of
the
law
the
law
can
only
aggravate
their
weakness
and
poverty
the
law
makes
them
ten
times
weaker
and
poorer
than
they
were
before
i
and
many
others
have
experienced
the
truth
of
this
i
have
known
monks
who
zealously
labored
to
please
god
for
salvation
but
the
more
they
labored
the
more
impatient
miserable
uncertain
and
fearful
they
became
what
else
can
you
expect
you
can
not
grow
strong
through
weakness
and
rich
through
poverty
people
who
prefer
the
law
to
the
gospel
are
like
aesop
dog
who
let
go
of
the
meat
to
snatch
at
the
shadow
of
the
water
there
is
no
satisfaction
in
the
law
what
satisfaction
can
there
be
in
collecting
laws
with
which
to
torment
oneself
and
others
one
law
breeds
ten
more
until
their
number
is
legion
who
would
have
thought
it
possible
that
the
galatians
taught
as
they
were
by
that
efficient
apostle
and
teacher
paul
could
so
quickly
be
led
astray
by
the
false
apostles
to
fall
away
from
the
gospel
is
an
easy
matter
because
few
people
appreciate
what
an
excellent
treasure
the
knowledge
of
christ
really
is
people
are
not
sufficiently
exercised
in
their
faith
by
afflictions
they
do
not
wrestle
against
sin
they
live
in
security
without
conflict
because
they
have
never
been
tried
in
the
furnace
of
affliction
they
are
not
properly
equipped
with
the
armor
of
god
and
know
not
how
to
use
the
sword
of
the
spirit
as
long
as
they
are
being
shepherded
by
faithful
pastors
all
is
well
but
when
their
faithful
shepherds
are
gone
and
wolves
disguised
as
sheep
break
into
the
fold
back
they
go
to
the
weak
and
beggarly
elements
of
the
law
whoever
goes
back
to
the
law
loses
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
fails
in
the
recognition
of
his
sinfulness
does
not
know
god
nor
the
devil
nor
himself
and
does
not
understand
the
meaning
and
purpose
of
the
law
without
the
knowledge
of
christ
a
man
will
always
argue
that
the
law
is
necessary
for
salvation
that
it
will
strengthen
the
weak
and
enrich
the
poor
wherever
this
opinion
holds
sway
the
promises
of
god
are
denied
christ
is
demoted
hypocrisy
and
idolatry
are
established
verse
whereunto
ye
desire
again
to
be
in
bondage
the
apostle
pointedly
asks
the
galatians
whether
they
desire
to
be
in
bondage
again
to
the
law
the
law
is
weak
and
poor
the
sinner
is
weak
and
poor
two
feeble
beggars
trying
to
help
each
other
they
can
not
do
it
they
only
wear
each
other
out
but
through
christ
a
weak
and
poor
sinner
is
revived
and
enriched
unto
eternal
life
verse
ye
observe
days
and
months
and
times
and
years
the
apostle
paul
knew
what
the
false
apostles
were
teaching
the
galatians
the
observance
of
days
and
months
and
times
and
years
the
jews
had
been
obliged
to
keep
holy
the
sabbath
day
the
new
moons
the
feast
of
the
passover
the
feast
of
tabernacles
and
other
feasts
the
false
apostles
constrained
the
galatians
to
observe
these
jewish
feasts
under
threat
of
damnation
paul
hastens
to
tell
the
galatians
that
they
were
exchanging
their
christian
liberty
for
the
weak
and
beggarly
elements
of
the
world
verse
i
am
afraid
of
you
lest
i
have
bestowed
upon
you
labor
in
vain
it
grieves
the
apostle
to
think
that
he
might
have
preached
the
gospel
to
the
galatians
in
vain
but
this
statement
expresses
more
than
grief
behind
his
apparent
disappointment
at
their
failure
lurks
the
sharp
reprimand
that
they
had
forsaken
christ
and
that
they
were
proving
themselves
to
be
obstinate
unbelievers
but
he
does
not
openly
condemn
them
for
fear
that
oversharp
criticism
might
alienate
them
altogether
he
therefore
changes
the
tone
of
his
voice
and
speaks
kindly
to
them
verse
be
as
i
am
for
i
am
as
ye
are
up
to
this
point
paul
has
been
occupied
with
the
doctrinal
aspect
of
the
apostasy
of
the
galatians
he
did
not
conceal
his
disappointment
at
their
lack
of
stability
he
had
rebuked
them
he
had
called
them
fools
crucifiers
of
christ
etc
now
that
the
more
important
part
of
his
epistle
has
been
finished
he
realizes
that
he
has
handled
the
galatians
too
roughly
anxious
lest
he
should
do
more
harm
than
good
he
is
careful
to
let
them
see
that
his
criticism
proceeds
from
affection
and
a
true
apostolic
concern
for
their
welfare
he
is
eager
to
mitigate
his
sharp
words
with
gentle
sentiments
in
order
to
win
them
again
like
paul
all
pastors
and
ministers
ought
to
have
much
sympathy
for
their
poor
straying
sheep
and
instruct
them
in
the
spirit
of
meekness
they
can
not
be
straightened
out
in
any
other
way
oversharp
criticism
provokes
anger
and
despair
but
no
repentance
and
here
let
us
note
by
the
way
that
true
doctrine
always
produces
concord
when
men
embrace
errors
the
tie
of
christian
love
is
broken
at
the
beginning
of
the
reformation
we
were
honored
as
the
true
ministers
of
christ
suddenly
certain
false
brethren
began
to
hate
us
we
had
given
them
no
offense
no
occasion
to
hate
us
they
knew
then
as
they
know
now
that
ours
is
the
singular
desire
to
publish
the
gospel
of
christ
everywhere
what
changed
their
attitude
toward
us
false
doctrine
seduced
into
error
by
the
false
apostles
the
galatians
refused
to
acknowledge
paul
as
their
pastor
the
name
and
doctrine
of
paul
became
obnoxious
to
them
i
fear
this
epistle
recalled
very
few
from
their
error
paul
knew
that
the
false
apostles
would
misconstrue
his
censure
of
the
galatians
to
their
own
advantage
and
say
so
this
is
your
paul
whom
you
praise
so
much
what
sweet
names
he
is
calling
you
in
his
letter
when
he
was
with
you
he
acted
like
a
father
but
now
he
acts
like
a
dictator
paul
knew
what
to
expect
of
the
false
apostles
and
therefore
he
is
worried
he
does
not
know
what
to
say
it
is
hard
for
a
man
to
defend
his
cause
at
a
distance
especially
when
he
has
reason
to
think
that
he
personally
has
fallen
into
disfavor
verse
be
as
i
am
for
i
am
as
ye
are
in
beseeching
the
galatians
to
be
as
he
is
paul
expresses
the
hope
that
they
might
hold
the
same
affection
for
him
that
he
holds
for
them
perhaps
i
have
been
a
little
hard
with
you
forgive
it
do
not
judge
my
heart
according
to
my
words
we
request
the
same
consideration
for
ourselves
our
way
of
writing
is
incisive
and
straightforward
but
there
is
no
bitterness
in
our
heart
we
seek
the
honor
of
christ
and
the
welfare
of
men
we
do
not
hate
the
pope
as
to
wish
him
we
do
not
desire
the
death
of
our
false
brethren
we
desire
that
they
may
turn
from
their
evil
ways
to
christ
and
be
saved
with
us
a
teacher
chastises
the
pupil
to
reform
him
the
rod
hurts
but
correction
is
necessary
a
father
punishes
his
son
because
he
loves
his
son
if
he
did
not
love
the
lad
he
would
not
punish
him
but
let
him
have
his
own
way
in
everything
until
he
comes
to
harm
paul
beseeches
the
galatians
to
look
upon
his
correction
as
a
sign
that
he
really
cared
for
them
now
no
chastening
for
the
present
seemeth
to
be
joyous
but
grievous
nevertheless
afterward
it
yieldeth
the
peaceable
fruit
of
righteousness
unto
them
which
are
exercised
thereby
heb
although
paul
seeks
to
soften
the
effect
of
his
reproachful
words
he
does
not
take
them
back
when
a
physician
administers
a
bitter
potion
to
a
patient
he
does
it
to
cure
the
patient
the
fact
that
the
medicine
is
bitter
is
no
fault
of
the
physician
the
malady
calls
for
a
bitter
medicine
paul
wants
the
galatians
to
judge
his
words
according
to
the
situation
that
made
them
necessary
verse
brethren
i
beseech
you
ye
have
not
injured
me
at
all
would
you
call
it
beseeching
the
galatians
to
call
them
bewitched
disobedient
crucifiers
of
christ
the
apostle
calls
it
an
earnest
beseeching
and
so
it
is
when
a
father
corrects
his
son
it
means
as
if
he
were
saying
my
son
i
beseech
you
be
a
good
boy
verse
ye
have
not
injured
me
at
all
i
am
not
angry
with
you
says
paul
why
should
i
be
angry
with
you
since
you
have
done
me
no
injury
at
all
to
this
the
galatians
reply
why
then
do
you
say
that
we
are
perverted
that
we
have
forsaken
the
true
doctrine
that
we
are
foolish
bewitched
if
you
are
not
angry
we
must
have
offended
you
somehow
paul
answers
you
galatians
have
not
injured
me
you
have
injured
yourselves
i
chide
you
not
because
i
wish
you
ill
i
have
no
reason
to
wish
you
god
is
my
witness
you
have
done
me
no
wrong
on
the
contrary
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
the
reason
i
write
to
you
is
because
i
love
you
the
bitter
potion
must
be
sweetened
with
honey
and
sugar
to
make
it
palatable
when
parents
have
punished
their
children
they
give
them
apples
pears
and
other
good
things
to
show
them
that
they
mean
well
verses
ye
know
how
through
infirmity
of
the
flesh
i
preached
the
gospel
unto
you
at
the
first
and
my
temptation
which
was
in
my
flesh
ye
despised
not
nor
rejected
but
received
me
as
an
angel
of
god
even
as
christ
jesus
you
galatians
were
very
good
to
me
when
i
began
to
preach
the
gospel
to
you
in
the
infirmity
of
my
flesh
and
in
great
temptation
you
were
not
at
all
offended
on
the
contrary
you
were
so
loving
so
kind
so
friendly
towards
me
you
received
me
like
an
angel
like
jesus
himself
indeed
the
galatians
are
to
be
commended
for
receiving
the
gospel
from
a
man
as
unimposing
and
afflicted
all
around
as
paul
was
wherever
he
preached
the
gospel
jews
and
gentiles
raved
against
him
all
the
influential
and
religious
people
of
his
day
denounced
him
but
the
galatians
did
not
mind
it
that
was
greatly
to
their
honor
and
paul
does
not
neglect
to
praise
them
for
it
this
praise
paul
bestows
on
none
of
the
other
churches
to
which
he
wrote
jerome
and
others
of
the
ancient
fathers
allege
this
infirmity
of
paul
to
have
been
some
physical
defect
or
concupiscence
jerome
and
the
other
diagnosticians
lived
at
a
time
when
the
church
enjoyed
peace
and
prosperity
when
the
bishops
increased
in
wealth
and
standing
when
pastors
and
bishops
no
longer
sat
over
the
word
of
god
no
wonder
they
failed
to
understand
paul
when
paul
speaks
of
the
infirmity
of
his
flesh
he
does
not
mean
some
physical
defect
or
carnal
lust
but
the
sufferings
and
afflictions
which
he
endured
in
his
body
what
these
infirmities
were
he
himself
explains
in
ii
corinthians
most
gladly
therefore
will
i
rather
glory
in
my
infirmities
that
the
power
of
christ
may
rest
upon
me
therefore
i
take
pleasure
in
infirmities
in
reproaches
in
necessities
in
persecutions
in
distresses
for
christ
sake
for
when
i
am
weak
then
am
i
strong
and
in
the
eleventh
chapter
of
the
same
epistle
the
apostle
writes
in
labors
more
abundant
in
stripes
above
measure
in
prisons
more
frequent
in
deaths
oft
of
the
jews
five
times
received
i
forty
stripes
save
one
thrice
was
i
beaten
with
rods
once
was
i
stoned
thrice
i
suffered
shipwreck
etc
ii
cor
by
the
infirmity
of
his
flesh
paul
meant
these
afflictions
and
not
some
chronic
disease
he
reminds
the
galatians
how
he
was
always
in
peril
at
the
hands
of
the
jews
gentiles
and
false
brethren
how
he
suffered
hunger
and
want
now
the
afflictions
of
the
believers
always
offend
people
paul
knew
it
and
therefore
has
high
praise
for
the
galatians
because
they
overlooked
his
afflictions
and
received
him
like
an
angel
christ
forewarned
the
faithful
against
the
offense
of
the
cross
saying
blessed
is
he
whosoever
shall
not
be
offended
in
me
matt
surely
it
is
no
easy
thing
to
confess
him
lord
of
all
and
savior
of
the
world
who
was
a
reproach
of
men
and
despised
of
the
people
and
the
laughing
stock
of
the
world
ps
i
say
to
value
this
poor
christ
so
spitefully
scorned
spit
upon
scourged
and
crucified
more
than
the
riches
of
the
richest
the
strength
of
the
strongest
the
wisdom
of
the
wisest
is
something
it
is
worth
being
called
blessed
paul
not
only
had
outward
afflictions
but
also
inner
spiritual
afflictions
he
refers
to
these
in
ii
corinthians
without
were
fightings
within
were
fears
in
his
letter
to
the
philippians
paul
makes
mention
of
the
restoration
of
epaphroditus
as
a
special
act
of
mercy
on
the
part
of
god
lest
i
should
have
sorrow
upon
sorrow
considering
the
many
afflictions
of
paul
we
are
not
surprised
to
hear
him
loudly
praising
the
galatians
for
not
being
offended
at
him
as
others
were
the
world
thinks
us
mad
because
we
go
about
to
comfort
to
help
to
save
others
while
we
ourselves
are
in
distress
people
tell
us
physician
heal
thyself
luke
the
apostle
tells
the
galatians
that
he
will
keep
their
kindness
in
perpetual
remembrance
indirectly
he
also
reminds
them
how
much
they
had
loved
him
before
the
invasion
of
the
false
apostles
and
gives
them
a
hint
that
they
should
return
to
their
first
love
for
him
verse
where
is
then
the
blessedness
ye
spake
of
how
much
happier
you
used
to
be
and
how
you
galatians
used
to
tell
me
that
you
were
blessed
and
how
much
did
i
not
praise
and
commend
you
formerly
paul
reminds
them
of
former
and
better
times
in
an
effort
to
mitigate
his
sharp
reproaches
lest
the
false
apostles
should
slander
him
and
misconstrue
his
letter
to
his
disadvantage
and
to
their
own
advantage
such
snakes
in
the
grass
are
equal
to
anything
they
will
pervert
words
spoken
from
a
sincere
heart
and
twist
them
to
mean
just
the
opposite
of
what
they
were
intended
to
convey
they
are
like
spiders
that
suck
venom
out
of
sweet
and
fragrant
flowers
the
poison
is
not
in
the
flowers
but
it
is
the
nature
of
the
spider
to
turn
what
is
good
and
wholesome
into
poison
verse
for
i
bear
you
record
that
if
it
had
been
possible
ye
would
have
plucked
out
your
own
eyes
and
have
given
them
to
me
the
apostle
continues
his
praise
of
the
galatians
you
did
not
only
treat
me
very
courteously
if
it
had
been
necessary
you
would
have
plucked
out
your
eyes
and
sacrificed
your
lives
for
me
and
in
very
fact
the
galatians
sacrificed
their
lives
for
paul
by
receiving
and
maintaining
paul
they
called
upon
their
own
heads
the
hatred
and
malice
of
all
the
jews
and
gentiles
nowadays
the
name
of
luther
carries
the
same
stigma
whoever
praises
luther
is
a
worse
sinner
than
an
idolater
perjurer
or
thief
verse
am
i
therefore
become
your
enemy
because
i
tell
you
the
truth
paul
reason
for
praising
the
galatians
is
to
avoid
giving
them
the
impression
as
if
he
were
their
enemy
because
he
had
reprimanded
them
a
true
friend
will
admonish
his
erring
brother
and
if
the
erring
brother
has
any
sense
at
all
he
will
thank
his
friend
in
the
world
truth
produces
hatred
whoever
speaks
the
truth
is
counted
an
enemy
but
among
friends
it
is
not
so
much
less
among
christians
the
apostle
wants
his
galatians
to
know
that
just
because
he
had
told
them
the
truth
they
are
not
to
think
that
he
dislikes
them
i
told
you
the
truth
because
i
love
you
verse
they
zealously
affect
you
but
not
well
paul
takes
the
false
apostles
to
task
for
their
flattery
satellites
softsoap
the
people
paul
calls
it
by
good
words
and
fair
speeches
to
deceive
the
hearts
of
the
simple
romans
they
tell
me
that
by
my
stubbornness
in
this
doctrine
of
the
sacrament
i
am
destroying
the
harmony
of
the
church
they
say
it
would
be
better
if
we
would
make
some
slight
concession
rather
than
cause
such
commotion
and
controversy
in
the
church
regarding
an
article
which
is
not
even
one
of
the
fundamental
doctrines
my
reply
is
cursed
be
any
love
or
harmony
which
demands
for
its
preservation
that
we
place
the
word
of
god
in
jeopardy
verse
yea
they
would
exclude
you
that
ye
might
affect
them
do
you
galatians
know
why
the
false
apostles
are
so
zealous
about
you
they
expect
you
to
reciprocate
and
that
would
leave
me
out
if
their
zeal
were
right
they
would
not
mind
your
loving
me
but
they
hate
my
doctrine
and
want
to
stamp
it
out
in
order
to
bring
this
to
pass
they
go
about
to
alienate
your
hearts
from
me
and
to
make
me
obnoxious
to
you
in
this
way
paul
brings
the
false
apostles
into
suspicion
he
questions
their
motives
he
maintains
that
their
zeal
is
mere
pretense
to
deceive
the
galatians
our
savior
christ
also
warned
us
saying
beware
of
false
prophets
which
come
to
you
in
sheep
clothing
matt
paul
was
considerably
disturbed
by
the
commissions
and
changes
that
followed
in
the
wake
of
his
preaching
he
was
accused
of
being
a
pestilent
fellow
a
mover
of
sedition
among
all
the
jews
throughout
the
world
acts
in
philippi
the
townspeople
cried
that
he
troubled
their
city
and
taught
customs
which
were
not
lawful
for
them
to
receive
acts
all
troubles
calamities
famines
wars
were
laid
to
the
charge
of
the
gospel
of
the
apostles
however
the
apostles
were
not
deterred
by
such
calumnies
from
preaching
the
gospel
they
knew
that
they
ought
to
obey
god
rather
than
men
and
that
it
was
better
for
the
world
to
be
upset
than
to
be
ignorant
of
christ
do
you
think
for
a
moment
that
these
reactions
did
not
worry
the
apostles
they
were
not
made
of
iron
they
foresaw
the
revolutionary
character
of
the
gospel
they
also
foresaw
the
dissensions
that
would
creep
into
the
church
it
was
bad
news
for
paul
when
he
heard
that
the
corinthians
were
denying
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
that
the
churches
he
had
planted
were
experiencing
all
kinds
of
difficulties
and
that
the
gospel
was
being
supplanted
by
false
doctrines
but
paul
also
knew
that
the
gospel
was
not
to
blame
he
did
not
resign
his
office
because
he
knew
that
the
gospel
he
preached
was
the
power
of
god
unto
salvation
to
every
one
that
believes
the
same
criticism
which
was
leveled
at
the
apostles
is
leveled
at
us
the
doctrine
of
the
gospel
we
are
told
is
the
cause
of
all
the
present
unrest
in
the
world
there
is
no
wrong
that
is
not
laid
to
our
charge
but
why
we
do
not
spread
wicked
lies
we
preach
the
glad
tidings
of
christ
our
opponents
will
bear
us
out
when
we
say
that
we
never
fail
to
urge
respect
for
the
constituted
authorities
because
that
is
the
will
of
god
all
of
these
vilifications
can
not
discourage
us
we
know
that
there
is
nothing
the
devil
hates
worse
than
the
gospel
it
is
one
of
his
little
tricks
to
blame
the
gospel
for
every
evil
in
the
world
formerly
when
the
traditions
of
the
fathers
were
taught
in
the
church
the
devil
was
not
excited
as
he
is
now
it
goes
to
show
that
our
doctrine
is
of
god
else
behemoth
would
lie
under
shady
trees
in
the
covert
of
the
reed
and
fens
the
fact
that
he
is
again
walking
about
as
a
roaring
lion
to
stir
up
riots
and
disorders
is
a
sure
sign
that
he
has
begun
to
feel
the
effect
of
our
preaching
verse
but
it
is
good
to
be
zealously
affected
always
in
a
good
thing
and
not
only
when
i
am
present
with
you
when
i
was
present
with
you
you
loved
me
although
i
preached
the
gospel
to
you
in
the
infirmity
of
my
flesh
the
fact
that
i
am
now
absent
from
you
ought
not
to
change
your
attitude
towards
me
although
i
am
absent
in
the
flesh
i
am
with
you
in
spirit
and
in
my
doctrine
which
you
ought
to
retain
by
all
means
because
through
it
you
received
the
holy
spirit
verse
my
little
children
of
whom
i
travail
in
birth
again
until
christ
be
formed
in
you
with
every
single
word
the
apostle
seeks
to
regain
the
confidence
of
the
galatians
he
now
calls
them
lovingly
his
little
children
he
adds
the
simile
of
whom
i
travail
in
birth
again
as
parents
reproduce
their
physical
characteristics
in
their
children
so
the
apostles
reproduced
their
faith
in
the
hearts
of
the
hearers
until
christ
was
formed
in
them
a
person
has
the
form
of
christ
when
he
believes
in
christ
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
this
faith
in
christ
is
engendered
by
the
gospel
as
the
apostle
declares
in
i
corinthians
in
christ
jesus
i
have
begotten
you
through
the
gospel
and
in
ii
corinthians
ye
are
the
epistle
of
christ
ministered
by
us
written
not
with
ink
but
with
the
spirit
of
the
living
god
the
word
of
god
falling
from
the
lips
of
the
apostle
or
minister
enters
into
the
heart
of
the
hearer
the
holy
ghost
impregnates
the
word
so
that
it
brings
forth
the
fruit
of
faith
in
this
manner
every
christian
pastor
is
a
spiritual
father
who
forms
christ
in
the
hearts
of
his
hearers
at
the
same
time
paul
indicts
the
false
apostles
he
says
i
have
begotten
you
galatians
through
the
gospel
giving
you
the
form
of
christ
but
these
false
apostles
are
giving
you
a
new
form
the
form
of
moses
note
the
apostle
does
not
say
of
whom
i
travail
in
birth
again
until
i
be
formed
in
you
but
until
christ
be
formed
in
you
the
false
apostles
had
torn
the
form
of
christ
out
of
the
hearts
of
the
galatians
and
substituted
their
own
form
paul
endeavors
to
reform
them
or
rather
reform
christ
in
them
verse
i
desire
to
be
present
with
you
now
and
to
change
my
voice
a
common
saying
has
it
that
a
letter
is
a
dead
messenger
something
is
lacking
in
all
writing
you
can
never
be
sure
how
the
written
page
will
affect
the
reader
because
his
mood
his
circumstances
his
affections
are
so
changeable
it
is
different
with
the
spoken
word
if
it
is
harsh
and
it
can
always
be
remodeled
no
wonder
the
apostle
expresses
the
wish
that
he
could
speak
to
the
galatians
in
person
he
could
change
his
voice
according
to
their
attitude
if
he
saw
that
they
were
repentant
he
could
soften
the
tone
of
his
voice
if
he
saw
that
they
were
stubborn
he
could
speak
to
them
more
earnestly
this
way
he
did
not
know
how
to
deal
with
them
by
letter
if
his
epistle
is
too
severe
it
will
do
more
damage
than
good
if
it
is
too
gentle
it
will
not
correct
conditions
but
if
he
could
be
with
them
in
person
he
could
change
his
voice
as
the
occasion
demanded
verse
for
i
stand
in
doubt
of
you
i
do
not
know
how
to
take
you
i
do
not
know
how
to
approach
you
by
letter
in
order
to
make
sure
that
he
leaves
no
stone
unturned
in
his
effort
to
recall
them
to
the
gospel
of
christ
he
chides
entreats
praises
and
blames
the
galatians
trying
every
way
to
hit
the
right
note
and
tone
of
voice
verse
tell
me
ye
that
desire
to
be
under
the
law
do
ye
not
hear
the
law
here
paul
would
have
closed
his
epistle
because
he
did
not
know
what
else
to
say
he
wishes
he
could
see
the
galatians
in
person
and
straighten
out
their
difficulties
but
he
is
not
sure
whether
the
galatians
have
fully
understood
the
difference
between
the
gospel
and
the
law
to
make
sure
he
introduces
another
illustration
he
knows
people
like
illustrations
and
stories
he
knows
that
christ
himself
made
ample
use
of
parables
paul
is
an
expert
at
allegories
they
are
dangerous
things
unless
a
person
has
a
thorough
knowledge
of
christian
doctrine
he
had
better
leave
allegories
alone
the
allegory
which
paul
is
about
to
bring
is
taken
from
the
book
of
genesis
which
he
calls
the
law
true
that
book
contains
no
mention
of
the
law
paul
simply
follows
the
custom
of
the
jews
who
included
the
first
book
of
moses
in
the
collective
term
law
jesus
even
included
the
psalms
verses
for
it
is
written
that
abraham
had
two
sons
the
one
by
a
bondmaid
the
other
by
a
freewoman
but
he
who
was
of
the
bondwoman
was
born
after
the
flesh
but
he
of
the
freewoman
was
by
promise
this
is
paul
allegory
abraham
had
two
sons
ishmael
by
hagar
and
isaac
by
sarah
they
were
both
the
true
sons
of
abraham
with
this
difference
that
ishmael
was
born
after
the
flesh
without
the
commandment
and
promise
of
god
while
isaac
was
born
according
to
the
promise
with
the
permission
of
sarah
abraham
took
hagar
sarah
bondwoman
to
wife
sarah
knew
that
god
had
promised
to
make
her
husband
abraham
the
father
of
a
nation
and
she
hoped
that
she
would
be
the
mother
of
this
promised
nation
but
with
the
passage
of
the
years
her
hope
died
out
in
order
that
the
promise
of
god
should
not
be
annulled
by
her
barrenness
this
holy
woman
resigned
her
right
and
honor
to
her
maid
this
was
no
easy
thing
for
her
to
do
she
abased
herself
she
thought
god
is
no
liar
what
he
has
promised
he
will
perform
but
perhaps
god
does
not
want
me
to
be
the
mother
of
abraham
posterity
perhaps
he
prefers
hagar
for
the
honor
ishmael
was
thus
born
without
a
special
word
or
promise
of
god
at
the
mere
request
of
sarah
god
did
not
command
abraham
to
take
hagar
nor
did
god
promise
to
bless
the
coalition
it
is
evident
that
ishmael
was
the
son
of
abraham
after
the
flesh
and
not
after
the
promise
in
the
ninth
chapter
of
the
epistle
to
the
romans
paul
advances
the
same
argument
which
he
amplifies
into
an
allegory
in
writing
to
the
galatians
there
he
argues
that
all
the
children
of
abraham
are
not
the
children
of
god
for
abraham
had
two
kinds
of
children
children
born
of
the
promise
like
isaac
and
other
children
born
without
the
promise
as
ishmael
with
this
argument
paul
squelched
the
proud
jews
who
gloried
that
they
were
the
children
of
god
because
they
were
the
seed
and
the
children
of
abraham
paul
makes
it
clear
enough
that
it
takes
more
than
an
abrahamic
pedigree
to
be
a
child
of
god
to
be
a
child
of
god
requires
faith
in
christ
verse
which
things
are
an
allegory
allegories
are
not
very
convincing
but
like
pictures
they
visualize
a
matter
if
paul
had
not
brought
in
advance
indisputable
arguments
for
the
righteousness
of
faith
over
against
the
righteousness
of
works
this
allegory
would
do
little
good
having
first
fortified
his
case
with
invincible
arguments
he
can
afford
to
inject
this
allegory
to
add
impressiveness
and
beauty
to
his
presentation
verses
for
these
are
the
two
covenants
the
one
from
the
mount
sinai
which
gendereth
to
bondage
which
is
agar
for
this
agar
is
mount
sinai
in
arabia
in
this
allegory
abraham
represents
god
abraham
had
two
sons
born
respectively
of
hagar
and
sarah
the
two
women
represent
the
two
testaments
the
old
testament
is
mount
sinai
the
bondwoman
hagar
the
arabians
call
mount
sinai
agar
it
may
be
that
the
similarity
of
these
two
names
gave
paul
his
idea
for
this
allegory
as
hagar
bore
abraham
a
son
who
was
not
an
heir
but
a
servant
so
sinai
the
law
the
allegorical
hagar
bore
god
a
carnal
and
servile
people
of
the
law
without
promise
the
law
has
a
promise
but
it
is
a
conditional
promise
depending
upon
whether
people
fulfill
the
law
the
jews
regarded
the
conditional
promises
of
the
law
as
if
they
were
unconditional
when
the
prophets
foretold
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
the
jews
stoned
them
as
blasphemers
of
god
they
never
gave
it
any
thought
that
there
was
a
condition
attached
to
the
law
which
reads
if
you
keep
the
commandments
it
shall
be
well
with
thee
verse
and
answereth
to
jerusalem
which
now
is
and
is
in
bondage
with
her
children
a
little
while
ago
paul
called
mount
sinai
hagar
he
would
now
gladly
make
jerusalem
the
sarah
of
the
new
testament
but
he
can
not
the
earthly
jerusalem
is
not
sarah
but
a
part
of
hagar
hagar
lives
there
in
the
home
of
the
law
the
temple
the
priesthood
the
ceremonies
and
whatever
else
was
ordained
in
the
law
at
mount
sinai
i
would
have
been
tempted
to
call
jerusalem
sarah
or
the
new
testament
i
would
have
been
pleased
with
this
turn
of
the
allegory
it
goes
to
show
that
not
everybody
has
the
gift
of
allegory
would
you
not
think
it
perfectly
proper
to
call
sinai
hagar
and
jerusalem
sarah
true
paul
does
call
sarah
jerusalem
but
he
has
the
spiritual
and
heavenly
jerusalem
in
mind
not
the
earthly
jerusalem
sarah
represents
that
spiritual
jerusalem
where
there
is
no
law
but
only
the
promise
and
where
the
inhabitants
are
free
to
show
that
the
law
has
been
quite
abolished
the
earthly
jerusalem
was
completely
destroyed
with
all
her
ornaments
temples
and
ceremonies
verse
but
jerusalem
which
is
above
is
free
which
is
the
mother
of
us
all
the
earthly
jerusalem
with
its
ordinances
and
laws
represents
hagar
and
her
offspring
they
are
slaves
to
the
law
sin
and
death
but
the
heavenly
jerusalem
is
sarah
the
free
woman
this
heavenly
jerusalem
is
the
church
that
is
to
say
the
number
of
all
believers
throughout
the
world
having
one
and
the
same
gospel
one
and
the
same
faith
in
christ
one
and
the
same
holy
ghost
and
the
same
sacraments
do
not
mistake
this
one
word
above
to
refer
to
the
triumphant
church
in
heaven
but
to
the
militant
church
on
earth
in
philippians
the
apostle
uses
the
phrase
our
conversation
is
in
heaven
not
locally
in
heaven
but
in
spirit
when
a
believer
accepts
the
heavenly
gifts
of
the
gospel
he
is
in
heaven
so
also
in
ephesians
who
hath
blessed
us
with
all
spiritual
blessings
in
heavenly
places
in
christ
jerusalem
here
means
the
universal
christian
church
on
earth
sarah
the
church
as
the
bride
of
christ
bears
free
children
who
are
not
subject
to
the
law
verse
for
it
is
written
rejoice
thou
barren
that
bearest
not
break
forth
and
cry
thou
that
travailest
not
for
the
desolate
hath
many
more
children
than
she
which
hath
an
husband
paul
quotes
the
allegorical
prophecy
of
isaiah
to
the
effect
that
the
mother
of
many
children
must
die
desolately
while
the
barren
woman
shall
have
an
abundance
of
children
isaiah
he
applies
this
prophecy
to
hagar
and
sarah
to
the
law
and
the
gospel
the
law
as
the
husband
of
the
fruitful
woman
procreates
many
children
for
men
of
all
ages
have
had
the
idea
that
they
are
right
when
they
follow
after
the
law
and
outwardly
perform
its
requirements
although
the
law
has
many
children
they
are
not
free
they
are
slaves
as
servants
they
can
not
have
a
share
in
the
inheritance
but
are
driven
from
the
house
as
ishmael
was
cast
out
of
the
house
of
abraham
in
fact
the
servants
of
the
law
are
even
now
barred
from
the
kingdom
of
light
and
liberty
for
he
that
believeth
not
is
condemned
already
john
as
the
servants
of
the
law
they
remain
under
the
curse
of
the
law
under
sin
and
death
under
the
power
of
the
devil
and
under
the
wrath
and
judgment
of
god
on
the
other
hand
sarah
the
free
church
seems
barren
the
gospel
of
the
cross
which
the
church
proclaims
does
not
have
the
appeal
that
the
law
has
for
men
and
therefore
it
does
not
find
many
adherents
the
church
does
not
look
prosperous
unbelievers
have
always
predicted
the
death
of
the
church
the
jews
were
quite
certain
that
the
church
would
not
long
endure
they
said
to
paul
as
concerning
this
sect
we
know
that
everywhere
it
is
spoken
against
acts
no
matter
how
barren
and
forsaken
how
weak
and
desolate
the
church
may
seem
she
alone
is
really
fruitful
before
god
by
the
gospel
she
procreates
an
infinite
number
of
children
that
are
free
heirs
of
everlasting
life
the
law
the
old
husband
is
really
dead
but
not
all
people
know
it
or
want
to
know
it
they
labor
and
bear
the
burden
and
the
heat
of
the
day
and
bring
forth
many
children
children
that
are
bastards
like
themselves
children
born
to
be
put
out
of
the
house
like
ishmael
to
perish
forever
accursed
be
that
doctrine
life
and
religion
which
endeavors
to
obtain
righteousness
before
god
by
the
law
and
its
creeds
the
scholastics
think
that
the
judicial
and
ceremonial
laws
of
moses
were
abolished
by
the
coming
of
christ
but
not
the
moral
law
they
are
blind
when
paul
declares
that
we
are
delivered
from
the
curse
of
the
law
he
means
the
whole
law
particularly
the
moral
law
which
more
than
the
other
laws
accuses
curses
and
condemns
the
conscience
the
ten
commandments
have
no
right
to
condemn
that
conscience
in
which
jesus
dwells
for
jesus
has
taken
from
the
ten
commandments
the
right
and
power
to
curse
us
not
as
if
the
conscience
is
now
insensitive
to
the
terrors
of
the
law
but
the
law
can
not
drive
the
conscience
to
despair
there
is
now
no
condemnation
to
them
which
are
in
christ
jesus
romans
if
the
son
shall
make
you
free
ye
shall
be
free
indeed
john
you
will
complain
but
i
am
not
doing
anything
that
is
right
you
can
not
do
a
thing
to
be
delivered
from
the
tyranny
of
the
law
but
listen
to
the
glad
tidings
which
the
holy
ghost
brings
to
you
in
the
words
of
the
prophet
rejoice
thou
barren
as
christ
is
greater
than
the
law
so
much
more
excellent
is
the
righteousness
of
christ
than
the
righteousness
of
the
law
in
one
more
respect
the
law
has
been
abolished
the
civil
laws
of
moses
do
not
concern
us
and
should
not
be
put
back
in
force
that
does
not
mean
that
we
are
exempt
from
obedience
to
the
civil
laws
under
which
we
live
on
the
contrary
the
gospel
commands
christians
to
obey
government
not
only
for
wrath
but
also
for
conscience
sake
romans
neither
do
the
ordinances
of
moses
or
those
of
the
pope
concern
us
but
because
life
can
not
go
on
without
some
ordinances
the
gospel
permits
regulations
to
be
made
in
the
church
in
regard
to
special
days
times
places
in
order
that
the
people
may
know
upon
what
day
at
what
hour
and
in
what
place
to
assemble
for
the
word
of
god
such
directions
are
desirable
that
all
things
be
done
decently
and
in
order
i
cor
these
directions
may
be
changed
or
omitted
altogether
as
long
as
no
offense
is
given
to
the
weak
paul
however
refers
particularly
to
the
abolition
of
the
moral
law
if
faith
alone
in
christ
justifies
then
the
whole
law
is
abolished
without
exception
and
this
the
apostle
proves
by
the
testimony
of
isaiah
who
bids
the
barren
to
rejoice
because
she
will
have
many
children
whereas
she
that
has
a
husband
and
many
children
will
be
forsaken
isaiah
calls
the
church
barren
because
her
children
are
born
without
effort
by
the
word
of
faith
through
the
spirit
of
god
it
is
a
matter
of
birth
not
of
exertion
the
believer
too
works
but
not
in
an
effort
to
become
a
son
and
an
heir
of
god
he
is
that
before
he
goes
to
work
he
is
born
a
son
and
an
heir
he
works
for
the
glory
of
god
and
the
welfare
of
his
fellowmen
verse
now
we
brethren
as
isaac
was
are
the
children
of
promise
the
jews
claimed
to
be
the
children
of
god
because
they
were
the
children
of
abraham
jesus
answered
them
john
if
ye
were
abraham
children
ye
would
do
the
works
of
abraham
but
now
ye
seek
to
kill
me
a
man
that
hath
told
you
the
truth
and
in
verse
if
god
were
your
father
ye
would
love
me
in
other
words
you
are
not
the
children
of
god
if
you
were
you
would
know
and
love
me
brothers
born
and
living
together
in
the
same
house
recognize
each
other
you
do
not
recognize
me
you
are
of
your
father
the
devil
we
are
not
like
these
jews
the
children
of
the
bondwoman
the
law
who
were
cast
out
of
the
house
by
jesus
we
are
children
of
the
promise
like
isaac
born
of
grace
and
faith
unto
an
everlasting
inheritance
verse
but
as
that
he
that
was
born
after
the
flesh
persecuted
him
that
was
born
after
the
spirit
even
so
it
is
now
this
is
a
cheering
thought
we
who
are
born
of
the
gospel
and
live
in
christ
and
rejoice
in
our
inheritance
have
ishmael
for
our
enemy
the
children
of
the
law
will
always
persecute
the
children
of
the
gospel
this
is
our
daily
experience
our
opponents
tell
us
that
everything
was
at
peace
before
the
gospel
was
revived
by
us
since
then
the
whole
world
has
been
upset
people
blame
us
and
the
gospel
for
everything
for
the
disobedience
of
subjects
to
their
rulers
for
wars
plagues
and
famines
for
revolutions
and
every
other
evil
that
can
be
imagined
no
wonder
our
opponents
think
they
are
doing
god
a
favor
by
hating
and
persecuting
us
ishmael
will
persecute
isaac
we
invite
our
opponents
to
tell
us
what
good
things
attended
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
by
the
apostles
did
not
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
follow
on
the
heels
of
the
gospel
and
how
about
the
overthrow
of
the
roman
empire
did
not
the
whole
world
seethe
with
unrest
as
the
gospel
was
preached
in
the
whole
world
we
do
not
say
that
the
gospel
instigated
these
upheavals
the
iniquity
of
man
did
it
our
opponents
blame
our
doctrine
for
the
present
turmoil
but
ours
is
a
doctrine
of
grace
and
peace
it
does
not
stir
up
trouble
trouble
starts
when
the
people
the
nations
and
their
rulers
of
the
earth
rage
and
take
counsel
together
against
the
lord
and
against
his
anointed
psalm
but
all
their
counsels
shall
be
brought
to
naught
he
that
sitteth
in
the
heavens
shall
laugh
the
lord
shall
have
them
in
derision
psalm
let
them
cry
out
against
us
as
much
as
they
like
we
know
that
they
are
the
cause
of
all
their
own
troubles
as
long
as
we
preach
christ
and
confess
him
to
be
our
savior
we
must
be
content
to
be
called
vicious
trouble
makers
these
that
have
turned
the
world
upside
down
are
come
hither
also
and
these
all
do
contrary
to
the
decrees
of
caesar
so
said
the
jews
of
paul
and
silas
acts
of
paul
they
said
we
have
found
this
man
a
pestilent
fellow
and
a
mover
of
sedition
among
all
the
jews
throughout
the
world
and
a
ringleader
of
the
sect
of
the
nazarenes
the
gentiles
uttered
similar
complaints
these
men
do
exceedingly
trouble
our
city
this
man
luther
is
also
accused
of
being
a
pestilent
fellow
who
troubles
the
papacy
and
the
roman
empire
if
i
would
keep
silent
all
would
be
well
and
the
pope
would
no
more
persecute
me
the
moment
i
open
my
mouth
the
pope
begins
to
fume
and
to
rage
it
seems
we
must
choose
between
christ
and
the
pope
let
the
pope
perish
christ
foresaw
the
reaction
of
the
world
to
the
gospel
he
said
i
am
come
to
send
fire
on
the
earth
and
what
will
i
if
it
be
already
kindled
luke
do
not
take
the
statement
of
our
opponents
seriously
that
no
good
can
come
of
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
what
do
they
know
they
would
not
recognize
the
fruits
of
the
gospel
if
they
saw
them
at
any
rate
our
opponents
can
not
accuse
us
of
adultery
murder
theft
and
such
crimes
the
worst
they
can
say
about
us
is
that
we
have
the
gospel
what
is
wrong
with
the
gospel
we
teach
that
christ
the
son
of
god
has
redeemed
us
from
sin
and
everlasting
death
this
is
not
our
doctrine
it
belongs
to
christ
if
there
is
anything
wrong
with
it
it
is
not
our
fault
if
they
want
to
condemn
christ
for
being
our
savior
and
redeemer
that
is
their
lookout
we
are
mere
onlookers
watching
to
see
who
will
win
the
victory
christ
or
his
opponents
on
one
occasion
jesus
remarked
if
ye
were
of
the
world
the
world
would
love
his
own
but
because
ye
are
not
of
the
world
but
i
have
chosen
you
out
of
the
world
therefore
the
world
hateth
you
john
in
other
words
i
am
the
cause
of
all
your
troubles
i
am
the
one
for
whose
sake
you
are
killed
if
you
did
not
confess
my
name
the
world
would
not
hate
you
the
servant
is
not
greater
than
his
lord
if
they
have
persecuted
me
they
will
also
persecute
you
christ
takes
all
the
blame
he
says
you
have
not
incurred
the
hatred
and
persecutions
of
the
world
i
have
but
be
of
good
cheer
i
have
overcome
the
world
verse
nevertheless
what
saith
the
scripture
cast
out
the
bondwoman
and
her
son
for
the
son
of
the
bondwoman
shall
not
be
heir
with
the
son
of
the
free
woman
sarah
demand
that
the
bondwoman
and
her
son
be
cast
out
of
the
house
was
undoubtedly
a
blow
to
abraham
he
felt
sorry
for
his
son
ishmael
the
scripture
explicitly
states
abraham
grief
in
the
words
and
the
thing
was
very
grievous
in
abraham
sight
because
of
his
son
gen
but
god
approved
sarah
action
and
said
to
abraham
let
it
not
be
grievous
in
thy
sight
because
of
the
lad
and
because
of
thy
bondwoman
in
all
that
sarah
hath
said
unto
thee
hearken
unto
her
voice
for
in
isaac
shall
thy
seed
be
called
gen
the
holy
ghost
contemptuously
calls
the
admirers
of
the
law
the
children
of
the
bondwoman
if
you
do
not
know
your
mother
i
will
tell
you
what
kind
of
a
woman
she
is
she
is
a
slave
and
you
are
slaves
you
are
slaves
of
the
law
and
therefore
slaves
of
sin
death
and
everlasting
damnation
you
are
not
fit
to
be
heirs
you
are
put
out
of
the
house
this
is
the
sentence
which
god
pronounces
upon
the
ishmaelites
the
papists
and
all
others
who
trust
in
their
own
merits
and
persecute
the
church
of
christ
because
they
are
slaves
and
persecutors
of
the
children
of
the
free
woman
they
shall
be
cast
out
of
the
house
of
god
forever
they
shall
have
no
inheritance
with
the
children
of
the
promise
this
sentence
stands
forever
this
sentence
affects
not
only
those
popes
cardinals
bishops
and
monks
who
were
notoriously
wicked
and
made
their
bellies
their
gods
it
strikes
also
those
who
lived
in
all
sincerity
to
please
god
and
to
merit
the
forgiveness
of
their
sins
through
a
life
of
even
these
will
be
cast
out
because
they
are
children
of
the
bondwoman
our
opponents
do
not
defend
their
own
moral
delinquency
the
better
ones
deplore
and
abhor
it
but
they
defend
and
uphold
their
doctrine
of
works
which
is
of
the
devil
our
quarrel
is
not
with
those
who
live
in
manifest
sins
our
quarrel
is
with
those
among
them
who
think
they
live
like
angels
claiming
that
they
do
not
only
perform
the
ten
commandments
of
god
but
also
the
sayings
of
christ
and
many
good
works
that
god
does
not
expect
of
them
we
quarrel
with
them
because
they
refuse
to
have
jesus
merit
count
alone
for
righteousness
bernard
was
one
of
the
best
of
the
medieval
saints
he
lived
a
chaste
and
holy
life
but
when
it
came
to
dying
he
did
not
trust
in
his
chaste
life
for
salvation
he
prayed
i
have
lived
a
wicked
life
but
thou
lord
jesus
hast
a
heaven
to
give
unto
me
first
because
thou
art
the
son
of
god
secondly
because
thou
hast
purchased
heaven
for
me
by
thy
suffering
and
death
thou
givest
heaven
to
me
not
because
i
earned
it
but
because
thou
hast
earned
it
for
me
if
any
of
the
romanists
are
saved
it
is
because
they
forget
their
good
deeds
and
merits
and
feel
like
paul
not
having
mine
own
righteousness
which
is
of
the
law
but
that
which
is
through
the
faith
of
christ
phil
verse
so
then
brethren
we
are
not
children
of
the
bondwoman
but
of
the
free
with
this
sentence
the
apostle
paul
concludes
his
allegory
of
the
barren
church
this
sentence
forms
a
clear
rejection
of
the
righteousness
of
the
law
and
a
confirmation
of
the
doctrine
of
justification
in
the
next
chapter
paul
lays
special
stress
upon
the
freedom
which
the
children
of
the
free
woman
enjoy
he
treats
of
christian
liberty
the
knowledge
of
which
is
very
necessary
the
liberty
which
christ
purchased
for
us
is
a
bulwark
to
us
in
our
battle
against
spiritual
tyranny
therefore
we
must
carefully
study
this
doctrine
of
christian
liberty
not
only
for
the
confirmation
of
the
doctrine
of
justification
but
also
for
the
comfort
and
encouragement
of
those
who
are
weak
in
faith
chapter
in
this
chapter
the
apostle
paul
presents
the
doctrine
of
christian
liberty
in
a
final
effort
to
persuade
the
galatians
to
give
up
the
nefarious
doctrine
of
the
false
apostles
to
accomplish
his
purpose
he
adduces
threats
and
promises
trying
in
every
way
possible
to
keep
them
in
the
liberty
which
christ
purchased
for
them
verse
stand
fast
therefore
in
the
liberty
wherewith
christ
hath
made
us
free
be
steadfast
not
careless
lie
not
down
and
sleep
but
stand
up
be
watchful
hold
fast
the
liberty
wherewith
christ
hath
made
you
free
those
who
loll
can
not
keep
this
liberty
satan
hates
the
light
of
the
gospel
when
it
begins
to
shine
a
little
he
fights
against
it
with
might
and
main
what
liberty
does
paul
mean
not
civil
liberty
for
which
we
have
the
government
to
thank
but
the
liberty
which
christ
has
procured
for
us
at
one
time
the
emperor
was
compelled
to
grant
to
the
bishop
of
rome
certain
immunities
and
privileges
this
is
civil
liberty
that
liberty
exempts
the
clergy
from
certain
public
charges
then
there
is
also
another
kind
of
liberty
when
people
obey
neither
the
laws
of
god
nor
the
laws
of
men
but
do
as
they
please
this
carnal
liberty
the
people
want
in
our
day
we
are
not
now
speaking
of
this
liberty
neither
are
we
speaking
of
civil
liberty
paul
is
speaking
of
a
far
better
liberty
the
liberty
wherewith
christ
hath
made
us
free
not
from
material
bonds
not
from
the
babylonian
captivity
not
from
the
tyranny
of
the
turks
but
from
the
eternal
wrath
of
god
where
is
this
liberty
in
the
conscience
our
conscience
is
free
and
quiet
because
it
no
longer
has
to
fear
the
wrath
of
god
this
is
real
liberty
compared
with
which
every
other
kind
of
liberty
is
not
worth
mentioning
who
can
adequately
express
the
boon
that
comes
to
a
person
when
he
has
the
that
god
will
nevermore
be
angry
with
him
but
will
forever
be
merciful
to
him
for
christ
sake
this
is
indeed
a
marvelous
liberty
to
have
the
sovereign
god
for
our
friend
and
father
who
will
defend
maintain
and
save
us
in
this
life
and
in
the
life
to
come
as
an
outgrowth
of
this
liberty
we
are
at
the
same
time
free
from
the
law
sin
death
the
power
of
the
devil
hell
etc
since
the
wrath
of
god
has
been
assuaged
by
christ
no
law
sin
or
death
may
now
accuse
and
condemn
us
these
foes
of
ours
will
continue
to
frighten
us
but
not
too
much
the
worth
of
our
christian
liberty
can
not
be
exaggerated
our
conscience
must
be
trained
to
fall
back
on
the
freedom
purchased
for
us
by
christ
though
the
fears
of
the
law
the
terrors
of
sin
the
horror
of
death
assail
us
occasionally
we
know
that
these
feelings
shall
not
endure
because
the
prophet
quotes
god
as
saying
in
a
little
wrath
i
hid
my
face
from
thee
for
a
moment
but
with
everlasting
kindness
will
i
have
mercy
on
thee
isa
we
shall
appreciate
this
liberty
all
the
more
when
we
bear
in
mind
that
it
was
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
who
purchased
it
with
his
own
blood
hence
christ
liberty
is
given
us
not
by
the
law
or
for
our
own
righteousness
but
freely
for
christ
sake
in
the
eighth
chapter
of
the
gospel
of
john
jesus
declares
if
the
son
shall
make
you
free
ye
shall
be
free
indeed
he
only
stands
between
us
and
the
evils
which
trouble
and
afflict
us
and
which
he
has
overcome
for
us
reason
can
not
properly
evaluate
this
gift
who
can
fully
appreciate
the
blessing
of
the
forgiveness
of
sins
and
of
everlasting
life
our
opponents
claim
that
they
also
possess
this
liberty
but
they
do
not
when
they
are
put
to
the
test
all
their
slips
from
them
what
else
can
they
expect
when
they
trust
in
works
and
not
in
the
word
of
god
our
liberty
is
founded
on
christ
himself
who
sits
at
the
right
hand
of
god
and
intercedes
for
us
therefore
our
liberty
is
sure
and
valid
as
long
as
we
believe
in
christ
as
long
as
we
cling
to
him
with
a
steadfast
faith
we
possess
his
priceless
gifts
but
if
we
are
careless
and
indifferent
we
shall
lose
them
it
is
not
without
good
reason
that
paul
urges
us
to
watch
and
to
stand
fast
he
knew
that
the
devil
delights
in
taking
this
liberty
away
from
us
verse
and
be
not
entangled
again
with
the
yoke
of
bondage
because
reason
prefers
the
righteousness
of
the
law
to
the
righteousness
of
faith
paul
calls
the
law
a
yoke
a
yoke
of
bondage
peter
also
calls
it
a
yoke
why
tempt
ye
god
to
put
a
yoke
upon
the
neck
of
the
disciples
which
neither
our
fathers
nor
we
were
able
to
bear
acts
in
this
passage
paul
again
disparages
the
pernicious
notion
that
the
law
is
able
to
make
men
righteous
before
god
a
notion
deeply
rooted
in
man
reason
all
mankind
is
so
wrapped
up
in
this
idea
that
it
is
hard
to
drag
it
out
of
people
paul
compares
those
who
seek
to
be
justified
by
the
law
to
oxen
that
are
hitched
to
the
yoke
like
oxen
that
toil
in
the
yoke
all
day
and
in
the
evening
are
turned
out
to
graze
along
the
dusty
road
and
at
last
are
marked
for
slaughter
when
they
no
longer
can
draw
the
burden
so
those
who
seek
to
be
justified
by
the
law
are
entangled
with
the
yoke
of
bondage
and
when
they
have
grown
old
and
in
the
service
of
the
law
they
have
earned
for
their
perpetual
reward
god
wrath
and
everlasting
torment
we
are
not
now
treating
of
an
unimportant
matter
it
is
a
matter
that
involves
everlasting
liberty
or
everlasting
slavery
for
as
a
liberation
from
god
wrath
through
the
kind
office
of
christ
is
not
a
passing
boon
but
a
permanent
blessing
so
also
the
yoke
of
the
law
is
not
a
temporary
but
an
everlasting
affliction
rightly
are
the
doers
of
the
law
called
devil
martyrs
they
take
more
pains
to
earn
hell
than
the
martyrs
of
christ
to
obtain
heaven
theirs
is
a
double
misfortune
first
they
torture
themselves
on
earth
with
penances
and
finally
when
they
die
they
gain
the
reward
of
eternal
damnation
verse
behold
i
paul
say
unto
you
that
if
ye
be
circumcised
christ
shall
profit
you
nothing
paul
is
incensed
at
the
thought
of
the
tyranny
of
the
law
his
antagonism
to
the
law
is
a
personal
matter
with
him
behold
i
paul
he
says
i
who
have
received
the
gospel
not
from
men
but
by
the
revelation
of
jesus
christ
i
who
have
been
commissioned
from
above
to
preach
the
gospel
to
you
i
paul
say
to
you
if
you
submit
to
circumcision
christ
will
profit
you
nothing
paul
emphatically
declares
that
for
the
galatians
to
be
circumcised
would
mean
for
them
to
lose
the
benefits
of
christ
suffering
and
death
this
passage
may
well
serve
as
a
criterion
for
all
the
religions
to
teach
that
besides
faith
in
christ
other
devices
like
works
or
the
observance
of
rules
traditions
or
ceremonies
are
necessary
for
the
attainment
of
righteousness
and
everlasting
life
is
to
make
christ
and
his
salvation
of
no
benefit
to
anybody
this
passage
is
an
indictment
of
the
whole
papacy
all
priests
monks
and
nuns
and
i
am
now
speaking
of
the
best
of
them
who
repose
their
hope
for
salvation
in
their
own
works
and
not
in
christ
whom
they
imagine
to
be
an
angry
judge
hear
this
sentence
pronounced
against
them
that
christ
shall
profit
them
nothing
if
one
can
earn
the
forgiveness
of
sins
and
everlasting
life
through
one
own
efforts
to
what
purpose
was
christ
born
what
was
the
purpose
of
his
suffering
and
death
his
resurrection
his
victory
over
sin
death
and
the
devil
if
men
may
overcome
these
evils
by
their
own
endeavor
tongue
can
not
express
nor
heart
conceive
what
a
terrible
thing
it
is
to
make
christ
worthless
the
person
who
is
not
moved
by
these
considerations
to
leave
the
law
and
the
confidence
in
his
own
righteousness
for
the
liberty
in
christ
has
a
heart
that
is
harder
than
stone
and
iron
paul
does
not
condemn
circumcision
in
itself
circumcision
is
not
injurious
to
the
person
who
does
not
ascribe
any
particular
importance
to
it
neither
are
works
injurious
provided
a
person
does
not
attach
any
saving
value
to
them
the
apostle
does
not
say
that
works
are
objectionable
but
to
build
one
hopes
for
righteousness
on
works
is
disastrous
for
that
makes
christ
good
for
nothing
let
us
bear
this
in
mind
when
the
devil
accuses
our
conscience
when
that
dragon
accuses
us
of
having
done
no
good
at
all
but
only
evil
say
to
him
you
trouble
me
with
the
remembrance
of
my
past
sins
you
remind
me
that
i
have
done
no
good
but
this
does
not
bother
me
because
if
i
were
to
trust
in
my
own
good
deeds
or
despair
because
i
have
done
no
good
deeds
christ
would
profit
me
neither
way
i
am
not
going
to
make
him
unprofitable
to
me
this
i
would
do
if
i
should
presume
to
purchase
for
myself
the
favor
of
god
and
everlasting
life
by
my
good
deeds
or
if
i
should
despair
of
my
salvation
because
of
my
sins
verse
for
i
testify
again
to
every
man
that
is
circumcised
that
he
is
a
debtor
to
do
the
whole
law
the
first
fault
with
circumcision
is
that
it
makes
christ
unprofitable
the
second
fault
is
that
it
obligates
those
who
are
circumcised
to
observe
the
whole
law
paul
is
so
very
much
in
earnest
about
this
matter
that
he
confirms
it
with
an
oath
i
testify
he
says
i
swear
by
the
living
god
paul
statement
may
be
explained
negatively
to
mean
i
testify
to
every
man
who
is
being
circumcised
that
he
can
not
perform
the
law
in
any
point
in
the
very
act
of
circumcision
he
is
not
being
circumcised
and
in
the
very
act
of
fulfilling
the
law
he
fulfills
it
not
this
seems
to
be
the
simple
meaning
of
paul
statement
later
on
in
the
sixth
chapter
he
explicitly
states
they
themselves
which
are
circumcised
keep
not
the
law
the
fact
that
you
are
circumcised
does
not
mean
you
are
righteous
and
free
from
the
law
the
truth
is
that
by
circumcision
you
have
become
debtors
and
servants
of
the
law
the
more
you
endeavor
to
perform
the
law
the
more
you
will
become
tangled
up
in
the
yoke
of
the
law
the
truth
of
this
i
have
experienced
in
myself
and
in
others
i
have
seen
many
work
themselves
down
to
the
bones
in
their
hungry
effort
to
obtain
peace
of
conscience
but
the
harder
they
tried
the
more
they
worried
especially
in
the
presence
of
death
they
were
so
uneasy
that
i
have
seen
murderers
die
with
better
grace
and
courage
this
holds
true
also
in
regard
to
the
church
regulations
when
i
was
a
monk
i
tried
ever
so
hard
to
live
up
to
the
strict
rules
of
my
order
i
used
to
make
a
list
of
my
sins
and
i
was
always
on
the
way
to
confession
and
whatever
penances
were
enjoined
upon
me
i
performed
religiously
in
spite
of
it
all
my
conscience
was
always
in
a
fever
of
doubt
the
more
i
sought
to
help
my
poor
stricken
conscience
the
worse
it
got
the
more
i
paid
attention
to
the
regulations
the
more
i
transgressed
them
hence
those
that
seek
to
be
justified
by
the
law
are
much
further
away
from
the
righteousness
of
life
than
the
publicans
sinners
and
harlots
they
know
better
than
to
trust
in
their
own
works
they
know
that
they
can
not
ever
hope
to
obtain
forgiveness
by
their
sins
paul
statement
in
this
verse
may
be
taken
to
mean
that
those
who
submit
to
circumcision
are
thereby
submitting
to
the
whole
law
to
obey
moses
in
one
point
requires
obedience
to
him
in
all
points
it
does
no
good
to
say
that
only
circumcision
is
necessary
and
not
the
rest
of
moses
laws
the
same
reasons
that
obligate
a
person
to
accept
circumcision
also
obligate
a
person
to
accept
the
whole
law
thus
to
acknowledge
the
law
is
tantamount
to
declaring
that
christ
is
not
yet
come
and
if
christ
is
not
yet
come
then
all
the
jewish
ceremonies
and
laws
concerning
meats
places
and
times
are
still
in
force
and
christ
must
be
awaited
as
one
who
is
still
to
come
the
whole
scripture
however
testifies
that
christ
has
come
that
by
his
death
he
has
abolished
the
law
and
that
he
has
fulfilled
all
things
which
the
prophets
have
foretold
about
him
some
would
like
to
subjugate
us
to
certain
parts
of
the
mosaic
law
but
this
is
not
to
be
permitted
under
any
circumstances
if
we
permit
moses
to
rule
over
us
in
one
thing
we
must
obey
him
in
all
things
verse
christ
is
become
of
no
effect
unto
you
whosoever
of
you
are
justified
by
the
law
ye
are
fallen
from
grace
paul
in
this
verse
discloses
that
he
is
not
speaking
so
much
of
circumcision
as
the
trust
which
men
repose
in
the
outward
act
we
can
hear
him
say
i
do
not
condemn
the
law
in
itself
what
i
condemn
is
that
men
seek
to
be
justified
by
the
law
as
if
christ
were
still
to
come
or
as
if
he
alone
were
unable
to
justify
sinners
it
is
this
that
i
condemn
because
it
makes
christ
of
no
effect
it
makes
you
void
of
christ
so
that
christ
is
not
in
you
nor
can
you
be
partakers
of
the
knowledge
the
spirit
the
fellowship
the
liberty
the
life
or
the
achievements
of
christ
you
are
completely
separated
from
him
so
much
so
that
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
any
more
or
for
that
matter
you
with
him
can
anything
worse
be
said
against
the
law
if
you
think
christ
and
the
law
can
dwell
together
in
your
heart
you
may
be
sure
that
christ
dwells
not
in
your
heart
for
if
christ
is
in
your
heart
he
neither
condemns
you
nor
does
he
ever
bid
you
to
trust
in
your
own
good
works
if
you
know
christ
at
all
you
know
that
good
works
do
not
serve
unto
righteousness
nor
evil
works
unto
condemnation
i
do
not
want
to
withhold
from
good
works
their
due
praise
nor
do
i
wish
to
encourage
evil
works
but
when
it
comes
to
justification
i
say
we
must
concentrate
upon
christ
alone
or
else
we
make
him
you
must
choose
between
christ
and
the
righteousness
of
the
law
if
you
choose
christ
you
are
righteous
before
god
if
you
stick
to
the
law
christ
is
of
no
use
to
you
verse
ye
are
fallen
from
grace
that
means
you
are
no
longer
in
the
kingdom
or
condition
of
grace
when
a
person
on
board
ship
falls
into
the
sea
and
is
drowned
it
makes
no
difference
from
which
end
or
side
of
the
ship
he
falls
into
the
water
those
who
fall
from
grace
perish
no
matter
how
they
go
about
it
those
who
seek
to
be
justified
by
the
law
are
fallen
from
grace
and
are
in
grave
danger
of
eternal
death
if
this
holds
true
in
the
case
of
those
who
seek
to
be
justified
by
the
moral
law
what
will
become
of
those
i
should
like
to
know
who
endeavor
to
be
justified
by
their
own
regulations
and
vows
they
will
fall

the
very
bottom
of

oh
no
they
say
we
will
fly
straight
into

you
live

rules

let
these
playthings
of
the
devil
go
to
the
place
where
they
came
from
and
listen
to
what
paul
has
to
say
in
this
verse
in
accordance
with
christ
own
teaching
he
that
believeth
in
the
son
of
god
hath
everlasting
life
but
he
that
believeth
not
in
the
son
shall
not
see
life
but
the
wrath
of
god
abideth
in
him
the
words
ye
are
fallen
from
grace
must
not
be
taken
lightly
they
are
important
to
fall
from
grace
means
to
lose
the
atonement
the
forgiveness
of
sins
the
righteousness
liberty
and
life
which
jesus
has
merited
for
us
by
his
death
and
resurrection
to
lose
the
grace
of
god
means
to
gain
the
wrath
and
judgment
of
god
death
the
bondage
of
the
devil
and
everlasting
condemnation
verse
for
we
through
the
spirit
wait
for
the
hope
of
righteousness
by
faith
paul
concludes
the
whole
matter
with
the
above
statement
you
want
to
be
justified
by
the
law
by
circumcision
and
by
works
we
can
not
see
it
to
be
justified
by
such
means
would
make
christ
of
no
value
to
us
we
would
be
obliged
to
perform
the
whole
law
we
rather
through
the
spirit
wait
for
the
hope
of
righteousness
the
apostle
is
not
satisfied
to
say
justified
by
faith
he
adds
hope
to
faith
holy
writ
speaks
of
hope
in
two
ways
as
the
object
of
the
emotion
and
hope
as
the
emotion
itself
in
the
first
chapter
of
the
epistle
to
the
colossians
we
have
an
instance
of
its
first
use
for
the
hope
which
is
laid
up
for
you
in
heaven
the
thing
hoped
for
in
the
sense
of
emotion
we
quote
the
passage
from
the
eighth
chapter
of
the
epistle
to
the
romans
for
we
are
saved
by
hope
as
paul
uses
the
term
hope
here
in
writing
to
the
galatians
we
may
take
it
in
either
of
its
two
meanings
we
may
understand
paul
to
say
we
wait
in
spirit
through
faith
for
the
righteousness
that
we
hope
for
which
in
due
time
will
be
revealed
to
us
or
we
may
understand
paul
to
say
we
wait
in
spirit
by
faith
for
righteousness
with
great
hope
and
desire
true
we
are
righteous
but
our
righteousness
is
not
yet
revealed
as
long
as
we
live
here
sin
stays
with
us
not
to
forget
the
law
in
our
members
striving
against
the
law
of
our
mind
when
sin
rages
in
our
body
and
we
through
the
spirit
wrestle
against
it
then
we
have
cause
for
hope
we
are
not
yet
perfectly
righteous
perfect
righteousness
is
still
to
be
attained
hence
we
hope
for
it
this
is
sweet
comfort
for
us
and
we
are
to
make
use
of
it
in
comforting
the
afflicted
we
are
to
say
to
them
brother
you
would
like
to
feel
god
favor
as
you
feel
your
sin
but
you
are
asking
too
much
your
righteousness
rests
on
something
much
better
than
feelings
wait
and
hope
until
it
will
be
revealed
to
you
in
the
lord
own
time
do
go
by
your
feelings
but
go
by
the
doctrine
of
faith
which
pledges
christ
to
you
the
question
occurs
to
us
what
difference
is
there
between
faith
and
hope
we
find
it
difficult
to
see
any
difference
faith
and
hope
are
so
closely
linked
that
they
can
not
be
separated
still
there
is
a
difference
between
them
first
hope
and
faith
differ
in
regard
to
their
sources
faith
originates
in
the
understanding
while
hope
rises
in
the
will
secondly
they
differ
in
regard
to
their
functions
faith
says
what
is
to
be
done
faith
teaches
describes
directs
hope
exhorts
the
mind
to
be
strong
and
courageous
thirdly
they
differ
in
regard
to
their
objectives
faith
concentrates
on
the
truth
hope
looks
to
the
goodness
of
god
fourthly
they
differ
in
sequence
faith
is
the
beginning
of
life
before
tribulation
hebrews
hope
comes
later
and
is
born
of
tribulation
romans
fifthly
they
differ
in
regard
to
their
effects
faith
is
a
judge
it
judges
errors
hope
is
a
soldier
it
fights
against
tribulations
the
cross
despondency
despair
and
waits
for
better
things
to
come
in
the
midst
of
evil
without
hope
faith
can
not
endure
on
the
other
hand
hope
without
faith
is
blind
rashness
and
arrogance
because
it
lacks
knowledge
before
anything
else
a
christian
must
have
the
insight
of
faith
so
that
the
intellect
may
know
its
directions
in
the
day
of
trouble
and
the
heart
may
hope
for
better
things
by
faith
we
begin
by
hope
we
continue
this
passage
contains
excellent
doctrine
and
much
comfort
it
declares
that
we
are
justified
not
by
works
sacrifices
or
ceremonies
but
by
christ
alone
the
world
may
judge
certain
things
to
be
ever
so
good
without
christ
they
are
all
wrong
circumcision
and
the
law
and
good
works
are
carnal
we
says
paul
are
above
such
things
we
possess
christ
by
faith
and
in
the
midst
of
our
afflictions
we
hopefully
wait
for
the
consummation
of
our
righteousness
you
may
say
the
trouble
is
i
do
feel
as
if
i
am
righteous
you
must
not
feel
but
believe
unless
you
believe
that
you
are
righteous
you
do
christ
a
great
wrong
for
he
has
cleansed
you
by
the
washing
of
regeneration
he
died
for
you
so
that
through
him
you
may
obtain
righteousness
and
everlasting
life
verse
for
in
jesus
christ
neither
circumcision
availeth
any
thing
nor
uncircumcision
but
faith
which
worketh
by
love
faith
must
of
course
be
sincere
it
must
be
a
faith
that
performs
good
works
through
love
if
faith
lacks
love
it
is
not
true
faith
thus
the
apostle
bars
the
way
of
hypocrites
to
the
kingdom
of
christ
on
all
sides
he
declares
on
the
one
hand
in
christ
jesus
circumcision
availeth
nothing
works
avail
nothing
but
faith
alone
and
that
without
any
merit
whatever
avails
before
god
on
the
other
hand
the
apostle
declares
that
without
fruits
faith
serves
no
purpose
to
think
if
faith
justifies
without
works
let
us
work
nothing
is
to
despise
the
grace
of
god
idle
faith
is
not
justifying
faith
in
this
terse
manner
paul
presents
the
whole
life
of
a
christian
inwardly
it
consists
in
faith
towards
god
outwardly
in
love
towards
our
verse
ye
did
run
well
who
did
hinder
you
that
ye
should
not
obey
the
truth
this
is
plain
speaking
paul
asserts
that
he
teaches
the
same
truth
now
which
he
has
always
taught
and
that
the
galatians
ran
well
as
long
as
they
obeyed
the
truth
but
now
misled
by
the
false
apostles
they
no
longer
run
he
compares
the
christian
life
to
a
race
when
everything
runs
along
smoothly
the
hebrews
spoke
of
it
as
a
race
ye
did
run
well
means
that
everything
went
along
smoothly
and
happily
with
the
galatians
they
lived
a
christian
life
and
were
on
the
right
way
to
everlasting
life
the
words
ye
did
run
well
are
encouraging
indeed
often
our
lives
seem
to
creep
rather
than
to
run
but
if
we
abide
in
the
true
doctrine
and
walk
in
the
spirit
we
have
nothing
to
worry
about
god
judges
our
lives
differently
what
may
seem
to
us
a
life
slow
in
christian
development
may
seem
to
god
a
life
of
rapid
progression
in
grace
verse
who
did
hinder
you
that
ye
should
not
obey
the
truth
the
galatians
were
hindered
in
the
christian
life
when
they
turned
from
faith
and
grace
to
the
law
covertly
the
apostle
blames
the
false
apostles
for
impeding
the
christian
progress
of
the
galatians
the
false
apostles
persuaded
the
galatians
to
believe
that
they
were
in
error
and
that
they
had
made
little
or
no
progress
under
the
influence
of
paul
under
the
baneful
influence
of
the
false
apostles
the
galatians
thought
they
were
well
off
and
advancing
rapidly
in
christian
knowledge
and
living
verse
this
persuasion
cometh
not
of
him
that
calleth
you
paul
explains
how
those
who
had
been
deceived
by
false
teachers
may
be
restored
to
spiritual
health
the
false
apostles
were
amiable
fellows
apparently
they
surpassed
paul
in
learning
and
godliness
the
galatians
were
easily
deceived
by
outward
appearances
they
supposed
they
were
being
taught
by
christ
himself
paul
proved
to
them
that
their
new
doctrine
was
not
of
christ
but
of
the
devil
in
this
way
he
succeeded
in
regaining
many
we
also
are
able
to
win
back
many
from
the
errors
into
which
they
were
seduced
by
showing
that
their
beliefs
are
imaginary
wicked
and
contrary
to
the
word
of
god
the
devil
is
a
cunning
persuader
he
knows
how
to
enlarge
the
smallest
sin
into
a
mountain
until
we
think
we
have
committed
the
worst
crime
ever
committed
on
earth
such
stricken
consciences
must
be
comforted
and
set
straight
as
paul
corrected
the
galatians
by
showing
them
that
their
opinion
is
not
of
christ
because
it
runs
counter
to
the
gospel
which
describes
christ
as
a
meek
and
merciful
savior
satan
will
circumvent
the
gospel
and
explain
christ
in
this
his
own
diabolical
way
indeed
christ
is
meek
gentle
and
merciful
but
only
to
those
who
are
holy
and
righteous
if
you
are
a
sinner
you
stand
no
chance
did
not
christ
say
that
unbelievers
are
already
damned
and
did
not
christ
perform
many
good
deeds
and
suffer
many
evils
patiently
bidding
us
to
follow
his
example
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
your
life
is
in
accord
with
christ
precepts
or
example
you
are
a
sinner
you
are
no
good
at
all
satan
is
to
be
answered
in
this
way
the
scriptures
present
christ
in
a
twofold
aspect
first
as
a
gift
he
of
god
is
made
unto
us
wisdom
and
righteousness
and
sanctification
and
redemption
i
cor
hence
my
many
and
grievous
sins
are
nullified
if
i
believe
in
him
secondly
the
scriptures
present
christ
for
our
example
as
an
exemplar
he
is
to
be
placed
before
me
only
at
certain
times
in
times
of
joy
and
gladness
that
i
may
have
him
as
a
mirror
to
reflect
upon
my
shortcomings
but
in
the
day
of
trouble
i
will
have
christ
only
as
a
gift
i
will
not
listen
to
anything
else
except
that
christ
died
for
my
sins
to
those
that
are
cast
down
on
account
of
their
sins
christ
must
be
introduced
as
a
savior
and
gift
and
not
as
an
example
but
to
sinners
who
live
in
a
false
assurance
christ
must
be
introduced
as
an
example
the
hard
sayings
of
scripture
and
the
awful
judgments
of
god
upon
sin
must
be
impressed
upon
them
defy
satan
in
times
of
despair
say
o
cursed
satan
you
choose
a
nice
time
to
talk
to
me
about
doing
and
working
when
you
know
very
well
that
i
am
in
trouble
over
my
sins
i
will
not
listen
to
you
i
will
listen
to
christ
who
says
that
he
came
into
the
world
to
save
sinners
this
is
the
true
christ
and
there
is
none
other
i
can
find
plenty
of
examples
for
a
holy
life
in
abraham
isaiah
john
the
baptist
paul
and
other
saints
but
they
can
not
forgive
my
sins
they
can
not
save
me
they
can
not
procure
for
me
everlasting
life
therefore
i
will
not
have
you
for
my
teacher
o
satan
verse
a
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
lump
paul
concern
for
them
meant
nothing
to
some
of
the
galatians
many
had
disowned
him
as
their
teacher
and
gone
over
to
the
false
apostles
no
doubt
the
false
apostles
took
every
occasion
to
defame
paul
as
a
stubborn
and
contemptuous
fellow
who
thought
nothing
of
disrupting
the
unity
of
the
churches
for
no
other
reason
than
his
selfish
pride
and
jealousy
others
of
the
galatians
perhaps
saw
no
harm
in
deviating
a
trifle
from
the
doctrine
of
justification
and
faith
when
they
noticed
that
paul
made
so
much
ado
about
a
matter
that
seemed
of
no
particular
importance
to
them
they
raised
their
eyebrows
and
thought
within
themselves
what
if
we
did
deviate
a
little
from
the
doctrine
of
paul
what
if
we
are
a
little
to
blame
he
ought
to
overlook
the
whole
matter
and
not
make
such
an
issue
out
of
it
lest
the
unity
of
the
churches
be
disturbed
to
this
paul
replies
a
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
lump
our
opponents
record
the
same
complaints
about
us
they
put
us
down
as
contentious
faultfinders
but
these
are
the
crafty
passes
of
the
devil
with
which
he
seeks
to
overthrow
our
faith
we
answer
with
paul
a
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
lump
small
faults
grow
into
big
faults
to
tolerate
a
trifling
error
inevitably
leads
to
crass
heresy
the
doctrine
of
the
bible
is
not
ours
to
take
or
to
allow
liberties
with
we
have
no
right
to
change
even
a
tittle
of
it
when
it
comes
to
life
we
are
ready
to
do
to
suffer
to
forgive
anything
our
opponents
demand
as
long
as
faith
and
doctrine
remain
pure
and
uncorrupt
the
apostle
james
says
for
whosoever
shall
keep
the
whole
law
and
yet
offend
in
one
point
he
is
guilty
of
all
this
passage
supports
us
over
against
our
critics
who
claim
that
we
disregard
all
charity
to
the
great
injury
of
the
churches
we
protest
we
desire
nothing
more
than
peace
with
all
men
if
they
would
only
permit
us
to
keep
our
doctrine
of
faith
the
pure
doctrine
takes
precedence
before
charity
apostles
or
an
angel
from
heaven
let
others
praise
charity
and
concord
to
the
skies
we
magnify
the
authority
of
the
word
and
faith
charity
may
be
neglected
at
times
without
peril
but
not
the
word
and
faith
charity
suffers
all
things
it
gives
in
faith
suffers
nothing
it
never
yields
charity
is
often
deceived
but
is
never
put
out
because
it
has
nothing
to
lose
it
continues
to
do
well
even
to
the
ungrateful
when
it
comes
to
faith
and
salvation
in
the
midst
of
lies
and
errors
that
parade
as
truth
and
deceive
many
charity
has
no
voice
or
vote
let
us
not
be
influenced
by
the
popular
cry
for
charity
and
unity
if
we
do
not
love
god
and
his
word
what
difference
does
it
make
if
we
love
anything
at
all
paul
therefore
admonishes
both
teachers
and
hearers
not
to
esteem
lightly
the
doctrine
of
faith
as
if
it
were
a
toy
with
which
to
amuse
oneself
in
idle
hours
verse
l
have
confidence
in
you
through
the
lord
i
have
taught
admonished
and
reproved
you
enough
i
hope
the
best
for
you
the
question
occurs
to
us
whether
paul
did
well
to
trust
the
galatians
does
not
holy
writ
forbid
us
to
trust
in
men
faith
trusts
in
god
and
is
never
wrong
charity
trusts
in
men
and
is
often
wrong
this
charitable
trust
in
man
is
necessary
to
life
without
it
life
would
be
impossible
in
the
world
what
kind
of
life
would
ours
be
if
nobody
could
trust
anybody
else
true
christians
are
more
ready
to
believe
in
men
than
the
children
of
this
world
such
charitable
confidence
is
the
fruit
of
the
spirit
paul
had
such
trust
in
the
galatians
although
they
had
forsaken
his
doctrine
he
trusts
them
through
the
lord
insofar
as
they
were
in
christ
and
christ
in
them
once
they
had
forsaken
christ
altogether
the
apostle
will
trust
the
galatians
no
longer
verse
that
ye
will
be
none
otherwise
minded
not
minded
otherwise
than
i
have
taught
you
in
other
words
i
have
confidence
that
you
will
accept
no
doctrine
that
is
contrary
to
the
one
you
have
learned
from
me
verse
but
he
that
troubleth
you
shall
bear
his
judgment
whosoever
he
be
paul
assumes
the
role
of
a
judge
and
condemns
the
false
apostles
as
troublers
of
the
galatians
he
wants
to
frighten
the
galatians
with
his
severe
judgments
of
the
false
apostles
into
avoiding
false
doctrine
like
a
contagious
disease
we
can
hear
him
say
to
the
galatians
why
do
you
give
these
pestilent
fellows
a
hearing
in
the
first
place
they
only
trouble
you
the
doctrine
they
bring
causes
your
conscience
only
trouble
the
clause
whosoever
he
be
seems
to
indicate
that
the
false
apostles
in
outward
appearance
at
least
were
very
good
and
devout
men
it
may
be
that
among
them
was
some
outstanding
disciple
of
the
apostles
a
man
of
fame
and
authority
the
apostle
must
have
been
faced
by
this
very
situation
otherwise
his
vehemence
would
have
been
uncalled
for
no
doubt
many
of
the
galatians
were
taken
back
with
the
vehemency
of
the
apostle
they
perhaps
thought
why
should
he
be
so
stubborn
in
such
small
matters
why
is
he
so
quick
to
pronounce
damnation
upon
his
brethren
in
the
ministry
i
can
not
say
it
often
enough
that
we
must
carefully
differentiate
between
doctrine
and
life
doctrine
is
a
piece
of
heaven
life
is
a
piece
of
earth
life
is
sin
error
uncleanness
misery
and
charity
must
forbear
believe
hope
and
suffer
all
things
forgiveness
of
sins
must
be
continuous
so
that
sin
and
error
may
not
be
defended
and
sustained
but
with
doctrine
there
must
be
no
error
no
need
of
pardon
there
can
be
no
comparison
between
doctrine
and
life
the
least
little
point
of
doctrine
is
of
greater
importance
than
heaven
and
earth
therefore
we
can
not
allow
the
least
jot
of
doctrine
to
be
corrupted
we
may
overlook
the
offenses
and
errors
of
life
for
we
daily
sin
much
even
the
saints
sin
as
they
themselves
confess
in
the
lord
prayer
and
in
the
creed
but
our
doctrine
god
be
praised
is
pure
because
all
the
articles
of
our
faith
are
grounded
on
the
holy
scriptures
verse
and
i
brethren
if
i
yet
preach
circumcision
why
do
i
yet
suffer
persecution
then
is
the
offense
of
the
cross
ceased
in
his
great
desire
to
recall
the
galatians
paul
draws
himself
into
the
argument
he
says
because
i
refuse
to
recognize
circumcision
as
a
factor
in
our
salvation
i
have
brought
upon
myself
the
hatred
and
persecution
of
my
whole
nation
if
i
were
to
acknowledge
circumcision
the
jews
would
cease
to
persecute
me
in
fact
they
would
love
and
praise
me
but
because
i
preach
the
gospel
of
christ
and
the
righteousness
of
faith
i
must
suffer
persecution
the
false
apostles
know
how
to
avoid
the
cross
and
the
deadly
hatred
of
the
jewish
nation
they
preach
circumcision
and
thus
retain
the
favor
of
the
jews
if
they
had
their
way
they
would
ignore
all
differences
in
doctrine
and
preserve
unity
at
all
cost
but
their
unionistic
dreams
can
not
be
realized
without
loss
to
the
pure
doctrine
of
the
cross
it
would
be
too
bad
if
the
offense
of
the
cross
were
to
cease
to
the
corinthians
he
expressed
the
same
conviction
christ
sent
me
to
preach
the
gospel
not
with
wisdom
of
words
lest
the
cross
of
christ
should
be
made
of
none
effect
i
cor
here
someone
may
be
tempted
to
call
the
christians
crazy
deliberately
to
court
danger
by
preaching
and
confessing
the
truth
and
thus
to
bring
upon
ourselves
the
hatred
and
enmity
of
the
whole
world
is
this
not
madness
but
paul
does
not
mind
the
enmity
of
the
world
it
made
him
all
the
bolder
to
confess
christ
the
enmity
of
the
world
in
his
estimation
augurs
well
for
the
success
and
growth
of
the
church
which
fares
best
in
times
of
persecution
when
the
offense
of
the
cross
ceases
when
the
rage
of
the
enemies
of
the
cross
abates
when
everything
is
quiet
it
is
a
sign
that
the
devil
is
the
of
the
church
and
that
the
pure
doctrine
of
god
word
has
been
lost
saint
bernard
observed
that
the
church
is
in
best
shape
when
satan
assaults
it
on
every
side
by
trickery
and
violence
and
in
worst
shape
when
it
is
at
peace
in
support
of
his
statement
he
quotes
the
passage
from
the
song
of
hezekiah
behold
for
peace
i
had
great
bitterness
paul
looks
with
suspicion
upon
any
doctrine
that
does
not
provoke
antagonism
persecution
always
follows
on
the
heels
of
the
word
of
god
as
the
psalmist
experienced
i
believe
therefore
have
i
spoken
i
was
greatly
afflicted
ps
the
christians
are
accused
and
slandered
without
mercy
murderers
and
thieves
receive
better
treatment
than
christians
the
world
regards
true
christians
as
the
worst
offenders
for
whom
no
punishment
can
be
too
severe
the
world
hates
the
christians
with
amazing
brutality
and
without
compunction
commits
them
to
the
most
shameful
death
congratulating
itself
that
it
has
rendered
god
and
the
cause
of
peace
a
distinct
service
by
ridding
the
world
of
the
undesired
presence
of
these
christians
we
are
not
to
let
such
treatment
cause
us
to
falter
in
our
adherence
to
christ
as
long
as
we
experience
such
persecutions
we
know
all
is
well
with
the
gospel
jesus
held
out
the
same
comfort
to
his
disciples
in
the
fifth
chapter
of
matthew
blessed
are
ye
when
men
shall
revile
you
and
persecute
you
and
shall
say
all
manner
of
evil
against
you
falsely
for
my
sake
rejoice
and
be
exceeding
glad
for
great
is
your
reward
in
heaven
the
church
must
not
come
short
of
this
joy
i
would
not
want
to
be
at
peace
with
the
pope
the
bishops
the
princes
and
the
sectarians
unless
they
consent
to
our
doctrine
unity
with
them
would
be
an
unmistakable
sign
that
we
have
lost
the
true
doctrine
briefly
as
long
as
the
church
proclaims
the
doctrine
she
must
suffer
persecution
because
the
gospel
declares
the
mercy
and
glory
of
god
this
in
turn
stirs
up
the
devil
because
the
gospel
shows
him
up
for
what
he
is
the
devil
and
not
god
therefore
as
long
as
the
gospel
holds
sway
persecution
plays
the
accompaniment
or
else
there
is
something
the
matter
with
the
devil
when
he
is
hit
you
will
know
it
by
the
havoc
he
raises
everywhere
so
do
not
be
surprised
or
offended
when
hell
breaks
loose
look
upon
it
as
a
happy
indication
that
all
is
well
with
the
gospel
of
the
cross
god
forbid
that
the
offense
of
the
cross
should
ever
be
removed
this
would
be
the
case
if
we
were
to
preach
what
the
prince
of
this
world
and
his
followers
would
be
only
too
glad
to
hear
the
righteousness
of
works
you
would
never
know
the
devil
could
be
so
gentle
the
world
so
sweet
the
pope
so
gracious
and
the
princes
so
charming
but
because
we
seek
the
advantage
and
honor
of
christ
they
persecute
us
all
around
verse
i
would
they
were
even
cut
off
which
trouble
you
it
hardly
seems
befitting
an
apostle
not
only
to
denounce
the
false
apostles
as
troublers
of
the
church
and
to
consign
them
to
the
devil
but
also
to
wish
that
they
were
utterly
cut
off
what
else
would
you
call
it
but
plain
cursing
paul
i
suppose
is
alluding
to
the
rite
of
circumcision
as
if
he
were
saying
to
the
galatians
the
false
apostles
compel
you
to
cut
off
the
foreskin
of
your
flesh
well
i
wish
they
themselves
were
utterly
cut
off
by
the
roots
we
had
better
answer
at
once
the
question
whether
it
is
right
for
christians
to
curse
certainly
not
always
nor
for
every
little
cause
but
when
things
have
come
to
such
a
pass
that
god
and
his
word
are
openly
blasphemed
then
we
must
say
blessed
be
god
and
his
word
and
cursed
be
everything
that
is
contrary
to
god
and
his
word
even
though
it
should
be
an
apostle
or
an
angel
from
heaven
this
goes
to
show
again
how
much
importance
paul
attached
to
the
least
points
of
christian
doctrine
that
he
dared
to
curse
the
false
apostles
evidently
men
of
great
popularity
and
influence
what
right
then
have
we
to
make
little
of
doctrine
no
matter
how
nonessential
a
point
of
doctrine
may
seem
if
slighted
it
may
prove
the
gradual
disintegration
of
the
truths
of
our
salvation
let
us
do
everything
to
advance
the
glory
and
authority
of
god
word
every
tittle
of
it
is
greater
than
heaven
and
earth
christian
charity
and
unity
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
word
of
god
we
are
bold
to
curse
and
condemn
all
men
who
in
the
least
point
corrupt
the
word
of
god
for
a
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
lump
paul
does
right
to
curse
these
troublers
of
the
galatians
wishing
that
they
were
cut
off
and
rooted
out
of
the
church
of
god
and
that
their
doctrine
might
perish
forever
such
cursing
is
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
thus
peter
cursed
simon
the
sorcerer
thy
money
perish
with
thee
many
instances
of
this
holy
cursing
are
recorded
in
the
sacred
scriptures
especially
in
the
psalms
let
death
seize
upon
them
and
let
them
go
down
quick
into
hell
ps
the
doctrine
of
good
works
now
come
all
kinds
of
admonitions
and
precepts
it
was
the
custom
of
the
apostles
that
after
they
had
taught
faith
and
instructed
the
conscience
they
followed
it
up
with
admonitions
unto
good
works
that
the
believers
might
manifest
the
duties
of
love
toward
each
other
in
order
to
avoid
the
appearance
as
if
christianity
militated
against
good
works
or
opposed
civil
government
the
apostle
also
urges
us
to
give
ourselves
unto
good
works
to
lead
an
honest
life
and
to
keep
faith
and
love
with
one
another
this
will
give
the
lie
to
the
accusations
of
the
world
that
we
christians
are
the
enemies
of
decency
and
of
public
peace
the
fact
is
we
christians
know
better
what
constitutes
a
truly
good
work
than
all
the
philosophers
and
legislators
of
the
world
because
we
link
believing
with
doing
verse
for
brethren
ye
have
been
called
unto
liberty
only
use
not
liberty
for
an
occasion
to
the
flesh
but
by
love
serve
one
another
in
other
words
you
have
gained
liberty
through
christ
you
are
above
all
laws
as
far
as
conscience
is
concerned
you
are
saved
christ
is
your
liberty
and
life
therefore
law
sin
and
death
may
not
hurt
you
or
drive
you
to
despair
this
is
the
constitution
of
your
priceless
liberty
now
take
care
that
you
do
not
use
your
wonderful
liberty
for
an
occasion
of
the
flesh
satan
likes
to
turn
this
liberty
which
christ
has
gotten
for
us
into
licentiousness
already
the
apostle
jude
complained
in
his
day
there
are
certain
men
crept
in
unawares
turning
the
grace
of
our
god
into
lasciviousness
jude
the
flesh
reasons
if
we
are
without
the
law
we
may
as
well
indulge
ourselves
why
do
good
why
give
alms
why
suffer
evil
when
there
is
no
law
to
force
us
to
do
so
this
attitude
is
common
enough
people
talk
about
christian
liberty
and
then
go
and
cater
to
the
desires
of
covetousness
pleasure
pride
envy
and
other
vices
nobody
wants
to
fulfill
his
duties
nobody
wants
to
help
out
a
brother
in
distress
this
sort
of
thing
makes
me
so
impatient
at
times
that
i
wish
the
swine
who
trampled
precious
pearls
under
foot
were
back
once
again
under
the
tyranny
of
the
pope
you
can
not
wake
up
the
people
of
gomorrah
with
the
gospel
of
peace
even
we
creatures
of
the
world
do
not
perform
our
duties
as
zealously
in
the
light
of
the
gospel
as
we
did
before
in
the
darkness
of
ignorance
because
the
surer
we
are
of
the
liberty
purchased
for
us
by
christ
the
more
we
neglect
the
word
prayer
and
suffering
if
satan
were
not
continually
molesting
us
with
trials
with
the
persecution
of
our
enemies
and
the
ingratitude
of
our
brethren
we
would
become
so
careless
and
indifferent
to
all
good
works
that
in
time
we
would
lose
our
faith
in
christ
resign
the
ministry
of
the
word
and
look
for
an
easier
life
many
of
our
ministers
are
beginning
to
do
that
very
thing
they
complain
about
the
ministry
they
maintain
they
can
not
live
on
their
salaries
they
whimper
about
the
miserable
treatment
they
receive
at
the
hand
of
those
whom
they
delivered
from
the
servitude
of
the
law
by
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
these
ministers
desert
our
poor
and
maligned
christ
involve
themselves
in
the
affairs
of
the
world
seek
advantages
for
themselves
and
not
for
christ
with
what
results
they
shall
presently
find
out
since
the
devil
lies
in
ambush
for
those
in
particular
who
hate
the
world
and
seeks
to
deprive
us
of
our
liberty
of
the
spirit
or
to
brutalize
it
into
the
liberty
of
the
flesh
we
plead
with
our
brethren
after
the
manner
of
paul
that
they
may
never
use
this
liberty
of
the
spirit
purchased
for
us
by
christ
as
an
excuse
for
carnal
living
or
as
peter
expresses
it
i
peter
for
a
cloak
of
maliciousness
in
order
that
christians
may
not
abuse
their
liberty
the
apostle
encumbers
them
with
the
rule
of
mutual
love
that
they
should
serve
each
other
in
love
let
everybody
perform
the
duties
of
his
station
and
vocation
diligently
and
help
his
neighbor
to
the
limit
of
his
capacity
christians
are
glad
to
hear
and
obey
this
teaching
of
love
when
others
hear
about
this
christian
liberty
of
ours
they
at
once
infer
if
i
am
free
i
may
do
what
i
like
if
salvation
is
not
a
matter
of
doing
why
should
we
do
anything
for
the
poor
in
this
crude
manner
they
turn
the
liberty
of
the
spirit
into
wantonness
and
licentiousness
we
want
them
to
know
however
that
if
they
use
their
lives
and
possessions
after
their
own
pleasure
if
they
do
not
help
the
poor
if
they
cheat
their
in
business
and
snatch
and
scrape
by
hook
and
by
crook
everything
they
can
lay
their
hands
on
we
want
to
tell
them
that
they
are
not
free
no
matter
how
much
they
think
they
are
but
they
are
the
dirty
slaves
of
the
devil
and
are
seven
times
worse
than
they
ever
were
as
the
slaves
of
the
pope
as
for
us
we
are
obliged
to
preach
the
gospel
which
offers
to
all
men
liberty
from
the
law
sin
death
and
god
wrath
we
have
no
right
to
conceal
or
revoke
this
liberty
proclaimed
by
the
gospel
and
so
we
can
not
do
anything
with
the
swine
who
dive
headlong
into
the
filth
of
licentiousness
we
do
what
we
can
we
diligently
admonish
them
to
love
and
to
help
their
if
our
admonitions
bear
no
fruit
we
leave
them
to
god
who
will
in
his
own
good
time
take
care
of
these
disrespecters
of
his
goodness
in
the
meanwhile
we
comfort
ourselves
with
the
thought
that
our
labors
are
not
lost
upon
the
true
believers
they
appreciate
this
spiritual
liberty
and
stand
ready
to
serve
others
in
love
and
though
their
number
is
small
the
satisfaction
they
give
us
far
outweighs
the
discouragement
which
we
receive
at
the
hands
of
the
large
number
of
those
who
misuse
this
liberty
paul
can
not
possibly
be
misunderstood
for
he
says
brethren
ye
have
been
called
unto
liberty
in
order
that
nobody
might
mistake
the
liberty
of
which
he
speaks
for
the
liberty
of
the
flesh
the
apostle
adds
the
explanatory
note
only
use
not
liberty
for
an
occasion
to
the
flesh
but
by
love
serve
one
another
paul
now
explains
at
the
hand
of
the
ten
commandments
what
it
means
to
serve
one
another
in
love
verse
for
all
the
law
is
fulfilled
in
one
word
even
in
this
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
it
is
customary
with
paul
to
lay
the
doctrinal
foundation
first
and
then
to
build
on
it
the
gold
silver
and
gems
of
good
deeds
now
there
is
no
other
foundation
than
jesus
christ
upon
this
foundation
the
apostle
erects
the
structure
of
good
works
which
he
defines
in
this
one
sentence
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
in
adding
such
precepts
of
love
the
apostle
embarrasses
the
false
apostles
very
much
as
if
he
were
saying
to
the
galatians
i
have
described
to
you
what
spiritual
life
is
now
i
will
also
teach
you
what
truly
good
works
are
i
am
doing
this
in
order
that
you
may
understand
that
the
silly
ceremonies
of
which
the
false
apostles
make
so
much
are
far
inferior
to
the
works
of
christian
love
this
is
the
of
all
false
teachers
that
they
not
only
pervert
the
pure
doctrine
but
also
fail
in
doing
good
their
foundation
vitiated
they
can
only
build
wood
hay
and
stubble
oddly
enough
the
false
apostles
who
were
such
earnest
champions
of
good
works
never
required
the
work
of
charity
such
as
christian
love
and
the
practical
charity
of
a
helpful
tongue
hand
and
heart
their
only
requirement
was
that
circumcision
days
months
years
and
times
should
be
observed
they
could
not
think
of
any
other
good
works
the
apostle
exhorts
all
christians
to
practice
good
works
after
they
have
embraced
the
pure
doctrine
of
faith
because
even
though
they
have
been
justified
they
still
have
the
old
flesh
to
refrain
them
from
doing
good
therefore
it
becomes
necessary
that
sincere
preachers
cultivate
the
doctrine
of
good
works
as
diligently
as
the
doctrine
of
faith
for
satan
is
a
deadly
enemy
of
both
nevertheless
faith
must
come
first
because
without
faith
it
is
impossible
to
know
what
a
deed
is
let
nobody
think
that
he
knows
all
about
this
commandment
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
it
sounds
short
and
easy
but
show
me
the
man
who
can
teach
learn
and
do
this
commandment
perfectly
none
of
us
heed
or
urge
or
practice
this
commandment
properly
though
the
conscience
hurts
when
we
fail
to
fulfill
this
commandment
in
every
respect
we
are
not
overwhelmed
by
our
failure
to
bear
our
neighbor
sincere
and
brotherly
love
the
words
for
all
the
law
is
fulfilled
in
one
word
entail
a
criticism
of
the
galatians
you
are
so
taken
up
by
your
superstitions
and
ceremonies
that
serve
no
good
purpose
that
you
neglect
the
most
important
thing
love
jerome
says
we
wear
our
bodies
out
with
watching
fasting
and
labor
and
neglect
charity
the
queen
of
all
good
works
look
at
the
monks
who
meticulously
fast
watch
etc
to
skip
the
least
requirement
of
their
order
would
be
a
crime
of
the
first
magnitude
at
the
same
time
they
blithely
ignored
the
duties
of
charity
and
hated
each
other
to
death
that
is
no
sin
they
think
the
old
testament
is
replete
with
examples
that
indicate
how
much
god
prizes
charity
when
david
and
his
companions
had
no
food
with
which
to
still
their
hunger
they
ate
the
showbread
which
were
forbidden
to
eat
christ
disciples
broke
the
sabbath
law
when
they
plucked
the
ears
of
corn
christ
himself
broke
the
sabbath
as
the
jews
claimed
by
healing
the
sick
on
the
sabbath
these
incidents
indicate
that
love
ought
to
be
given
consideration
above
all
laws
and
ceremonies
verse
for
all
the
law
is
fulfilled
in
one
word
we
can
imagine
the
apostle
saying
to
the
galatians
why
do
you
get
so
worked
up
over
ceremonies
meats
days
places
and
such
things
leave
off
this
foolishness
and
listen
to
me
the
whole
law
is
comprehended
in
this
one
sentence
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
god
is
not
particularly
interested
in
ceremonies
nor
has
he
any
use
for
them
the
one
thing
he
requires
of
you
is
that
you
believe
in
christ
whom
he
hath
sent
if
in
addition
to
faith
which
comes
first
as
the
most
acceptable
service
unto
god
you
want
to
add
laws
then
you
want
to
know
that
all
laws
are
comprehended
in
this
short
commandment
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
paul
knows
how
to
explain
the
law
of
god
he
condenses
all
the
laws
of
moses
into
one
brief
sentence
reason
takes
offense
at
the
brevity
with
which
paul
treats
the
law
therefore
reason
looks
down
upon
the
doctrine
of
faith
and
its
truly
good
works
to
serve
one
another
in
love
to
instruct
the
erring
to
comfort
the
afflicted
to
raise
the
fallen
to
help
one
neighbor
in
every
possible
way
to
bear
with
his
infirmities
to
endure
hardships
toil
ingratitude
in
the
church
and
in
the
world
and
on
the
other
hand
to
obey
government
to
honor
parents
to
be
patient
at
home
with
a
nagging
wife
and
an
unruly
family
these
things
are
not
at
all
regarded
as
good
works
the
fact
is
they
are
such
excellent
works
that
the
world
can
not
possibly
estimate
them
at
their
true
value
it
is
tersely
spoken
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
but
what
more
needs
to
be
said
you
can
not
find
a
better
or
nearer
example
than
your
own
if
you
want
to
know
how
you
ought
to
love
your
neighbor
ask
yourself
how
much
you
love
yourself
if
you
were
to
get
into
trouble
or
danger
you
would
be
glad
to
have
the
love
and
help
of
all
men
you
do
not
need
any
book
of
instructions
to
teach
you
how
to
love
your
neighbor
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
look
into
your
own
heart
and
it
will
tell
you
how
you
ought
to
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
my
neighbor
is
every
person
especially
those
who
need
my
help
as
christ
explained
in
the
tenth
chapter
of
luke
even
if
a
person
has
done
me
some
wrong
or
has
hurt
me
in
any
way
he
is
still
a
human
being
with
flesh
and
blood
as
long
as
a
person
remains
a
human
being
so
long
is
he
to
be
an
object
of
our
love
paul
therefore
urges
his
galatians
and
incidentally
all
believers
to
serve
each
other
in
love
you
galatians
do
not
have
to
accept
circumcision
if
you
are
so
anxious
to
do
good
works
i
will
tell
you
in
one
word
how
you
can
fulfill
all
laws
love
serve
one
another
you
will
never
lack
people
to
whom
you
may
do
good
the
world
is
full
of
people
who
need
your
help
verse
but
if
ye
bite
and
devour
one
another
take
heed
that
ye
be
not
consumed
one
of
another
when
faith
in
christ
is
overthrown
peace
and
unity
come
to
an
end
in
the
church
diverse
opinions
and
dissensions
about
doctrine
and
life
spring
up
and
one
member
bites
and
devours
the
other
they
condemn
each
other
until
they
are
consumed
to
this
the
scriptures
and
the
experience
of
all
times
bear
witness
the
many
sects
at
present
have
come
into
being
because
one
sect
condemns
the
other
when
the
unity
of
the
spirit
has
been
lost
there
can
be
no
agreement
in
doctrine
or
life
new
errors
must
appear
without
measure
and
without
end
for
the
avoidance
of
discord
paul
lays
down
the
principle
let
every
person
do
his
duty
in
the
station
of
life
into
which
god
has
called
him
no
person
is
to
vaunt
himself
above
others
or
find
fault
with
the
efforts
of
others
while
lauding
his
own
let
everybody
serve
in
love
it
is
not
an
easy
matter
to
teach
faith
without
works
and
still
to
require
works
unless
the
ministers
of
christ
are
wise
in
handling
the
mysteries
of
god
and
rightly
divide
the
word
faith
and
good
works
may
easily
be
confused
both
the
doctrine
of
faith
and
the
doctrine
of
good
works
must
be
diligently
taught
and
yet
in
such
a
way
that
both
the
doctrines
stay
within
their
sphere
if
we
only
teach
works
as
our
opponents
do
we
shall
lose
the
faith
if
we
only
teach
faith
people
will
come
to
think
that
good
works
are
superfluous
verse
this
i
say
then
walk
in
the
spirit
and
ye
shall
not
fulfill
the
lust
of
the
flesh
i
have
not
forgotten
what
i
told
you
about
faith
in
the
first
part
of
my
letter
because
i
exhort
you
to
mutual
love
you
are
not
to
think
that
i
have
gone
back
on
my
teaching
of
justification
by
faith
alone
i
am
still
of
the
same
opinion
to
remove
every
possibility
for
misunderstanding
i
have
added
this
explanatory
note
in
the
spirit
and
ye
shall
not
fulfill
the
lust
of
the
flesh
with
this
verse
paul
explains
how
he
wants
this
sentence
to
be
understood
by
love
serve
one
another
when
i
bid
you
to
love
one
another
this
is
what
i
mean
and
require
in
the
spirit
i
know
very
well
you
will
not
fulfill
the
law
because
you
are
sinners
as
long
as
you
live
nevertheless
you
should
endeavor
to
walk
in
the
spirit
fight
against
the
flesh
and
follow
the
lead
of
the
holy
ghost
it
is
quite
apparent
that
paul
had
not
forgotten
the
doctrine
of
justification
for
in
bidding
the
galatians
to
walk
in
the
spirit
he
at
the
same
time
denies
that
good
works
can
justify
when
i
speak
of
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
are
justified
by
the
law
all
i
mean
to
say
is
that
you
should
take
the
spirit
for
your
guide
and
resist
the
flesh
that
is
the
most
you
shall
ever
be
able
to
do
obey
the
spirit
and
fight
against
the
flesh
verse
and
ye
shall
not
fulfill
the
lust
of
the
flesh
the
lust
of
the
flesh
is
not
altogether
extinct
in
us
it
rises
up
again
and
again
and
wrestles
with
the
spirit
no
flesh
not
even
that
of
the
true
believer
is
so
completely
under
the
influence
of
the
spirit
that
it
will
not
bite
or
devour
or
at
least
neglect
the
commandment
of
love
at
the
slightest
provocation
it
flares
up
demands
to
be
revenged
and
hates
a
neighbor
like
an
enemy
or
at
least
does
not
love
him
as
much
as
he
ought
to
be
loved
therefore
the
apostle
establishes
this
rule
of
love
for
the
believers
serve
one
another
in
love
bear
the
infirmities
of
your
brother
forgive
one
another
without
such
bearing
and
forbearing
giving
and
forgiving
there
can
be
no
unity
because
to
give
and
to
take
offense
are
unavoidably
human
whenever
you
are
angry
with
your
brother
for
any
cause
repress
your
violent
emotions
through
the
spirit
bear
with
his
weakness
and
love
him
he
does
not
cease
to
be
your
neighbor
or
brother
because
he
offended
you
on
the
contrary
he
now
more
than
ever
before
requires
your
loving
attention
the
scholastics
take
the
lust
of
the
flesh
to
mean
carnal
lust
true
believers
too
are
tempted
with
carnal
lust
even
the
married
are
not
immune
to
carnal
lusts
men
set
little
value
upon
that
which
they
have
and
covet
what
they
have
not
as
the
poet
says
the
things
most
forbidden
we
always
desire
and
things
most
denied
we
seek
to
acquire
i
do
not
deny
that
the
lust
of
the
flesh
includes
carnal
lust
but
it
takes
in
more
it
takes
in
all
the
corrupt
desires
with
which
the
believers
are
more
or
less
infected
as
pride
hatred
covetousness
impatience
later
on
paul
enumerates
among
the
works
of
the
flesh
even
idolatry
and
heresy
the
apostle
meaning
is
clear
i
want
you
to
love
one
another
but
you
do
not
do
it
in
fact
you
can
not
do
it
because
of
your
flesh
hence
we
can
not
be
justified
by
deeds
of
love
do
not
for
a
moment
think
that
i
am
reversing
myself
on
my
stand
concerning
faith
faith
and
hope
must
continue
by
faith
we
are
justified
by
hope
we
endure
to
the
end
in
addition
we
serve
each
other
in
love
because
true
faith
is
not
idle
our
love
however
is
faulty
in
bidding
you
to
walk
in
the
spirit
i
indicate
to
you
that
our
love
is
not
sufficient
to
justify
us
neither
do
i
demand
that
you
should
get
rid
of
the
flesh
but
that
you
should
control
and
subdue
it
verse
for
the
flesh
lusteth
against
the
spirit
and
the
spirit
against
the
flesh
when
paul
declares
that
the
flesh
lusteth
against
the
spirit
and
the
spirit
against
the
flesh
he
means
to
say
that
we
are
not
to
think
speak
or
do
the
things
to
which
the
flesh
incites
us
i
know
he
says
that
the
flesh
courts
sin
the
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
resist
the
flesh
by
the
spirit
but
if
you
abandon
the
leadership
of
the
spirit
for
that
of
the
flesh
you
are
going
to
fulfill
the
lust
of
the
flesh
and
die
in
your
sins
verse
and
these
are
contrary
the
one
to
the
other
so
that
ye
can
not
do
the
things
that
ye
would
these
two
leaders
the
flesh
and
the
spirit
are
bitter
opponents
of
this
opposition
the
apostle
writes
in
the
seventh
chapter
of
the
epistle
to
the
romans
i
see
another
law
in
my
members
warring
against
the
law
of
my
mind
and
bringing
me
into
the
captivity
to
the
law
of
sin
which
is
in
my
members
o
wretched
man
that
i
am
who
shall
deliver
me
from
the
body
of
this
death
the
scholastics
are
at
a
loss
to
understand
this
confession
of
paul
and
feel
obliged
to
save
his
honor
that
the
chosen
vessel
of
christ
should
have
had
the
law
of
sin
in
his
members
seems
to
them
incredible
and
absurd
they
circumvent
the
statement
of
the
apostle
by
saying
that
he
was
speaking
for
the
wicked
but
the
wicked
never
complain
of
inner
conflicts
or
of
the
captivity
of
sin
sin
has
its
unrestricted
way
with
them
this
is
paul
very
own
complaint
and
the
identical
complaint
of
all
believers
paul
never
denied
that
he
felt
the
lust
of
the
flesh
it
is
likely
that
at
times
he
felt
even
the
stirrings
of
carnal
lust
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
quickly
suppressed
them
and
if
at
any
time
he
felt
angry
or
impatient
he
resisted
these
feelings
by
the
spirit
we
are
not
going
to
stand
by
idly
and
see
such
a
comforting
statement
as
this
explained
away
the
scholastics
monks
and
others
of
their
ilk
fought
only
against
carnal
lust
and
were
proud
of
a
victory
which
they
never
obtained
in
the
meanwhile
they
harbored
within
their
breasts
pride
hatred
disdain
contempt
of
the
word
of
god
disloyalty
blasphemy
and
other
lusts
of
the
flesh
against
these
sins
they
never
fought
because
they
never
took
them
for
sins
christ
alone
can
supply
us
with
perfect
righteousness
therefore
we
must
always
believe
and
always
hope
in
christ
whosoever
believeth
shall
not
be
ashamed
rom
do
not
despair
if
you
feel
the
flesh
battling
against
the
spirit
or
if
you
can
not
make
it
behave
for
you
to
follow
the
guidance
of
the
spirit
in
all
things
without
interference
on
the
part
of
the
flesh
is
impossible
you
are
doing
all
you
can
if
you
resist
the
flesh
and
do
not
fulfill
its
demands
when
i
was
a
monk
i
thought
i
was
lost
forever
whenever
i
felt
an
evil
emotion
carnal
lust
wrath
hatred
or
envy
i
tried
to
quiet
my
conscience
in
many
ways
but
it
did
not
work
because
lust
would
always
come
back
and
give
me
no
rest
i
told
myself
you
have
permitted
this
and
that
sin
envy
impatience
and
the
like
your
joining
this
holy
order
has
been
in
vain
and
all
your
good
works
are
good
for
nothing
if
at
that
time
i
had
understood
this
passage
the
flesh
lusteth
against
the
spirit
and
the
spirit
against
the
flesh
i
could
have
spared
myself
many
a
day
of
i
would
have
said
to
myself
martin
you
will
never
be
without
sin
for
you
have
flesh
despair
not
but
resist
the
flesh
i
remember
how
doctor
staupitz
used
to
say
to
me
i
have
promised
god
a
thousand
times
that
i
would
become
a
better
man
but
i
never
kept
my
promise
from
now
on
i
am
not
going
to
make
any
more
vows
experience
has
taught
me
that
i
can
not
keep
them
unless
god
is
merciful
to
me
for
christ
sake
and
grants
unto
me
a
blessed
departure
i
shall
not
be
able
to
stand
before
him
his
was
a
despair
no
true
believer
trusts
in
his
own
righteousness
but
says
with
david
enter
not
into
judgment
with
thy
servant
for
in
thy
sight
shall
no
man
living
be
justified
ps
again
if
thou
lord
shouldest
mark
iniquities
o
lord
who
shall
stand
ps
no
man
is
to
despair
of
salvation
just
because
he
is
aware
of
the
lust
of
the
flesh
let
him
be
aware
of
it
so
long
as
he
does
not
yield
to
it
the
passion
of
lust
wrath
and
other
vices
may
shake
him
but
they
are
not
to
get
him
down
sin
may
assail
him
but
he
is
not
to
welcome
it
yes
the
better
christian
a
man
is
the
more
he
will
experience
the
heat
of
the
conflict
this
explains
the
many
expressions
of
regret
in
the
psalms
and
in
the
entire
bible
everybody
is
to
determine
his
peculiar
weakness
and
guard
against
it
watch
and
wrestle
in
spirit
against
your
weakness
even
if
you
can
not
completely
overcome
it
at
least
you
ought
to
fight
against
it
according
to
this
description
a
saint
is
not
one
who
is
made
of
wood
and
never
feels
any
lusts
or
desires
of
the
flesh
a
true
saint
confesses
his
righteousness
and
prays
that
his
sins
may
be
forgiven
the
whole
church
prays
for
the
forgiveness
of
sins
and
confesses
that
it
believes
in
the
forgiveness
of
sins
if
our
antagonists
would
read
the
scriptures
they
would
soon
discover
that
they
can
not
judge
rightly
of
anything
either
of
sin
or
of
holiness
verse
but
if
ye
be
led
of
the
spirit
ye
are
not
under
the
law
here
someone
may
object
how
come
we
are
not
under
the
law
you
yourself
say
paul
that
we
have
the
flesh
which
wars
against
the
spirit
and
brings
us
into
subjection
but
paul
says
not
to
let
it
trouble
us
as
long
as
we
are
led
by
the
spirit
and
are
willing
to
obey
the
spirit
who
resists
the
flesh
we
are
not
under
the
law
true
believers
are
not
under
the
law
the
law
can
not
condemn
them
although
they
feel
sin
and
confess
it
great
then
is
the
power
of
the
spirit
led
by
the
spirit
the
law
can
not
condemn
the
believer
though
he
commits
real
sin
for
christ
in
whom
we
believe
is
our
righteousness
he
is
without
sin
and
the
law
can
not
accuse
him
as
long
as
we
cling
to
him
we
are
led
by
the
spirit
and
are
free
from
the
law
even
as
he
teaches
good
works
the
apostle
does
not
lose
sight
of
the
doctrine
of
justification
but
shows
at
every
turn
that
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
be
justified
by
works
the
words
if
ye
be
led
of
the
spirit
ye
are
not
under
the
law
are
replete
with
comfort
it
happens
at
times
that
anger
hatred
impatience
carnal
desire
fear
sorrow
or
some
other
lust
of
the
flesh
so
overwhelms
a
man
that
he
can
not
shake
them
off
though
he
try
ever
so
hard
what
should
he
do
should
he
despair
god
forbid
let
him
say
to
himself
my
flesh
seems
to
be
on
a
warpath
against
the
spirit
again
go
to
it
flesh
and
rage
all
you
want
to
but
you
are
not
going
to
have
your
way
i
follow
the
leading
of
the
spirit
when
the
flesh
begins
to
cut
up
the
only
remedy
is
to
take
the
sword
of
the
spirit
the
word
of
salvation
and
fight
against
the
flesh
if
you
set
the
word
out
of
sight
you
are
helpless
against
the
flesh
i
know
this
to
be
a
fact
i
have
been
assailed
by
many
violent
passions
but
as
soon
as
i
took
hold
of
some
scripture
passage
my
temptations
left
me
without
the
word
i
could
not
have
helped
myself
against
the
flesh
verse
now
the
works
of
the
flesh
are
manifest
which
are
these
paul
is
saying
that
none
of
you
may
hide
behind
the
plea
of
ignorance
i
will
enumerate
first
the
works
of
the
flesh
and
then
also
the
works
of
the
spirit
there
were
many
hypocrites
among
the
galatians
as
there
are
also
among
us
who
pretend
to
be
christians
and
talk
much
about
the
spirit
but
they
walk
not
according
to
the
spirit
rather
according
to
the
flesh
paul
is
out
to
show
them
that
they
are
not
as
holy
as
they
like
to
have
others
think
they
are
every
period
of
life
has
its
own
peculiar
temptations
not
one
true
believer
whom
the
flesh
does
not
again
and
again
incite
to
impatience
anger
pride
but
it
is
one
thing
to
be
tempted
by
the
flesh
and
another
thing
to
yield
to
the
flesh
to
do
its
bidding
without
fear
or
remorse
and
to
continue
in
sin
christians
also
fall
and
perform
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
david
fell
horribly
into
adultery
peter
also
fell
grievously
when
he
denied
christ
however
great
these
sins
were
they
were
not
committed
to
spite
god
but
from
weakness
when
their
sins
were
brought
to
their
attention
these
men
did
not
obstinately
continue
in
their
sin
but
repented
those
who
sin
through
weakness
are
not
denied
pardon
as
long
as
they
rise
again
and
cease
to
sin
there
is
nothing
worse
than
to
continue
in
sin
if
they
do
not
repent
but
obstinately
continue
to
fulfill
the
desires
of
the
flesh
it
is
a
sure
sign
that
they
are
not
sincere
no
person
is
free
from
temptations
some
are
tempted
in
one
way
others
in
another
way
one
person
is
more
easily
tempted
to
bitterness
and
sorrow
of
spirit
blasphemy
distrust
and
despair
another
is
more
easily
tempted
to
carnal
lust
anger
envy
covetousness
but
no
matter
to
which
sins
we
are
disposed
we
are
to
walk
in
the
spirit
and
resist
the
flesh
those
who
are
christ
own
crucify
their
flesh
some
of
the
old
saints
labored
so
hard
to
attain
perfection
that
they
lost
the
capacity
to
feel
anything
when
i
was
a
monk
i
often
wished
i
could
see
a
saint
i
pictured
him
as
living
in
the
wilderness
abstaining
from
meat
and
drink
and
living
on
roots
and
herbs
and
cold
water
this
weird
conception
of
those
awesome
saints
i
had
gained
out
of
the
books
of
the
scholastics
and
church
fathers
but
we
know
now
from
the
scriptures
who
the
true
saints
are
not
those
who
live
a
single
life
or
make
a
fetish
of
days
meats
clothes
and
such
things
the
true
saints
are
those
who
believe
that
they
are
justified
by
the
death
of
christ
whenever
paul
writes
to
the
christians
here
and
there
he
calls
them
the
holy
children
and
heirs
of
god
all
who
believe
in
christ
whether
male
or
female
bond
or
free
are
saints
not
in
view
of
their
own
works
but
in
view
of
the
merits
of
god
which
they
appropriate
by
faith
their
holiness
is
a
gift
and
not
their
own
personal
achievement
ministers
of
the
gospel
public
officials
parents
children
masters
servants
are
true
saints
when
they
take
christ
for
their
wisdom
righteousness
sanctification
and
redemption
and
when
they
fulfill
the
duties
of
their
several
vocations
according
to
the
standard
of
word
and
repress
the
lust
and
desires
of
the
flesh
by
the
spirit
not
everybody
can
resist
temptations
with
equal
facility
imperfections
are
bound
to
show
up
but
this
does
not
prevent
them
from
being
holy
their
unintentional
lapses
are
forgiven
if
they
pull
themselves
together
by
faith
in
christ
god
forbid
that
we
should
sit
in
hasty
judgment
on
those
who
are
weak
in
faith
and
life
as
long
as
they
love
the
word
of
god
and
make
use
of
the
supper
of
the
lord
i
thank
god
that
he
has
permitted
me
to
see
what
as
a
monk
i
so
earnestly
desired
to
see
not
one
but
many
saints
whole
multitudes
of
true
saints
not
the
kind
of
saints
the
papists
admire
but
the
kind
of
saints
christ
wants
i
am
sure
i
am
one
of
christ
true
saints
i
am
baptized
i
believe
that
christ
my
lord
has
redeemed
me
from
all
my
sins
and
invested
me
with
his
own
eternal
righteousness
and
holiness
to
hide
in
caves
and
dens
to
have
a
bony
body
to
wear
the
hair
long
in
the
mistaken
idea
that
such
departures
from
normalcy
will
obtain
some
special
regard
in
heaven
is
not
the
holy
life
a
holy
life
is
to
be
baptized
and
to
believe
in
christ
and
to
subdue
the
flesh
with
the
spirit
to
feel
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
is
not
without
profit
to
us
it
prevents
us
from
being
vain
and
from
being
puffed
up
with
the
wicked
opinion
of
our
own
the
monks
were
so
inflated
with
the
opinion
of
their
own
righteousness
they
thought
they
had
so
much
holiness
that
they
could
afford
to
sell
some
of
it
to
others
although
their
own
hearts
convinced
them
of
unholiness
the
christian
feels
the
unholy
condition
of
his
heart
and
it
makes
him
feel
so
low
that
he
can
not
trust
in
his
good
works
he
therefore
goes
to
christ
to
find
perfect
righteousness
this
keeps
a
christian
humble
verses
now
the
works
of
the
flesh
are
manifest
which
are
these
adultery
fornication
uncleanness
lasciviousness
idolatry
witchcraft
paul
does
not
enumerate
all
the
works
of
the
flesh
but
only
certain
ones
first
he
mentions
various
kinds
of
carnal
lusts
as
adultery
fornication
wantonness
etc
but
carnal
lust
is
not
the
only
work
of
the
flesh
and
so
he
counts
among
the
works
of
the
flesh
also
idolatry
witchcraft
hatred
and
the
like
these
terms
are
so
familiar
that
they
do
not
require
lengthy
explanations
idolatry
the
best
religion
the
most
fervent
devotion
without
christ
is
plain
idolatry
it
has
been
considered
a
holy
act
when
the
monks
in
their
cells
meditate
upon
god
and
his
works
and
in
a
religious
frenzy
kneel
down
to
pray
and
to
weep
for
joy
yet
paul
calls
it
simply
idolatry
every
religion
which
worships
god
in
ignorance
or
neglect
of
his
word
and
will
is
idolatry
they
may
think
about
god
christ
and
heavenly
things
but
they
do
it
after
their
own
fashion
and
not
after
the
word
of
god
they
have
an
idea
that
their
clothing
their
mode
of
living
and
their
conduct
are
holy
and
pleasing
to
christ
they
not
only
expect
to
pacify
christ
by
the
strictness
of
their
life
but
also
expect
to
be
rewarded
by
him
for
their
good
deeds
hence
their
best
spiritual
thoughts
are
wicked
thoughts
any
worship
of
god
any
religion
without
christ
is
idolatry
in
christ
alone
is
god
well
pleased
i
have
said
before
that
the
works
of
the
flesh
are
manifest
but
idolatry
puts
on
such
a
good
front
and
acts
so
spiritual
that
the
sham
of
it
is
recognized
only
by
true
believers
witchcraft
this
sin
was
very
common
before
the
light
of
the
gospel
appeared
when
i
was
a
child
there
were
many
witches
and
sorcerers
around
who
bewitched
cattle
and
people
particularly
children
and
did
much
harm
but
now
that
the
gospel
is
here
you
do
not
hear
so
much
about
it
because
the
gospel
drives
the
devil
away
now
he
bewitches
people
in
a
worse
way
with
spiritual
sorcery
witchcraft
is
a
brand
of
idolatry
as
witches
used
to
bewitch
cattle
and
men
so
idolaters
all
the
go
around
to
bewitch
god
and
to
make
him
out
as
one
who
justifies
men
not
by
grace
through
faith
in
christ
but
by
the
works
of
men
own
choosing
they
bewitch
and
deceive
themselves
if
they
continue
in
their
wicked
thoughts
of
god
they
will
die
in
their
idolatry
sects
under
sects
paul
here
understands
heresies
heresies
have
always
been
found
in
the
church
what
unity
of
faith
can
exist
among
all
the
different
monks
and
the
different
orders
none
whatever
there
is
no
unity
of
spirit
no
agreement
of
minds
but
great
dissension
in
the
papacy
there
is
no
conformity
in
doctrine
faith
and
life
on
the
other
hand
among
evangelical
christians
the
word
faith
religion
sacraments
service
christ
god
heart
and
mind
are
common
to
all
this
unity
is
not
disturbed
by
outward
differences
of
station
or
of
occupation
drunkenness
gluttony
paul
does
not
say
that
eating
and
drinking
are
works
of
the
flesh
but
intemperance
in
eating
and
drinking
which
is
a
common
vice
nowadays
is
a
work
of
the
flesh
those
who
are
given
to
excess
are
to
know
that
they
are
not
spiritual
but
carnal
sentence
is
pronounced
upon
them
that
they
shall
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
heaven
paul
desires
that
christians
avoid
drunkenness
and
gluttony
that
they
live
temperate
and
sober
lives
in
order
that
the
body
may
not
grow
soft
and
sensual
verse
of
the
which
i
tell
you
before
as
i
have
also
told
you
in
the
past
that
they
which
do
such
things
shall
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
this
is
a
hard
saying
but
very
necessary
for
those
false
christians
and
hypocrites
who
speak
much
about
the
gospel
about
faith
and
the
spirit
yet
live
after
the
flesh
but
this
hard
sentence
is
directed
chiefly
at
the
heretics
who
are
large
with
their
own
that
they
may
be
frightened
into
taking
up
the
fight
of
the
spirit
against
the
flesh
verses
but
the
fruit
of
the
spirit
is
love
joy
peace
longsuffering
gentleness
goodness
faith
meekness
temperance
the
apostle
does
not
speak
of
the
works
of
the
spirit
as
he
spoke
of
the
works
of
the
flesh
but
he
attaches
to
these
christian
virtues
a
better
name
he
calls
them
the
fruits
of
the
spirit
love
it
would
have
been
enough
to
mention
only
the
single
fruit
of
love
for
love
embraces
all
the
fruits
of
the
spirit
in
i
corinthians
paul
attributes
to
love
all
the
fruits
of
the
spirit
charity
suffereth
long
and
is
kind
etc
here
he
lets
love
stand
by
itself
among
other
fruits
of
the
spirit
to
remind
the
christians
to
love
one
another
in
honor
preferring
one
another
to
esteem
others
more
than
themselves
because
they
have
christ
and
the
holy
ghost
within
them
joy
joy
means
sweet
thoughts
of
christ
melodious
hymns
and
psalms
praises
and
thanksgiving
with
which
christians
instruct
inspire
and
refresh
themselves
god
does
not
like
doubt
and
dejection
he
hates
dreary
doctrine
gloomy
and
melancholy
thought
god
likes
cheerful
hearts
he
did
not
send
his
son
to
fill
us
with
sadness
but
to
gladden
our
hearts
for
this
reason
the
prophets
apostles
and
christ
himself
urge
yes
command
us
to
rejoice
and
be
glad
rejoice
greatly
o
daughter
of
zion
shout
o
daughter
of
jerusalem
behold
thy
king
cometh
unto
thee
zech
in
the
psalms
we
are
repeatedly
told
to
be
joyful
in
the
lord
paul
says
rejoice
in
the
lord
always
christ
says
rejoice
for
your
names
are
written
in
heaven
peace
peace
towards
god
and
men
christians
are
to
be
peaceful
and
quiet
not
argumentative
not
hateful
but
thoughtful
and
patient
there
can
be
no
peace
without
longsuffering
and
therefore
paul
lists
this
virtue
next
longsuffering
longsuffering
is
that
quality
which
enables
a
person
to
bear
adversity
injury
reproach
and
makes
them
patient
to
wait
for
the
improvement
of
those
who
have
done
him
wrong
when
the
devil
finds
that
he
can
not
overcome
certain
persons
by
force
he
tries
to
overcome
them
in
the
long
run
he
knows
that
we
are
weak
and
can
not
stand
anything
long
therefore
he
repeats
his
temptation
time
and
again
until
he
succeeds
to
withstand
his
continued
assaults
we
must
be
longsuffering
and
patiently
wait
for
the
devil
to
get
tired
of
his
game
gentleness
gentleness
in
conduct
and
life
true
followers
of
the
gospel
must
not
be
sharp
and
bitter
but
gentle
mild
courteous
and
which
should
encourage
others
to
seek
their
company
gentleness
can
overlook
other
people
faults
and
cover
them
up
gentleness
is
always
glad
to
give
in
to
others
gentleness
can
get
along
with
forward
and
difficult
persons
according
to
the
old
pagan
saying
you
must
know
the
manners
of
your
friends
but
you
must
not
hate
them
such
a
gentle
person
was
our
savior
jesus
christ
as
the
gospel
portrays
him
of
peter
it
is
recorded
that
he
wept
whenever
he
remembered
the
sweet
gentleness
of
christ
in
his
daily
contact
with
people
gentleness
is
an
excellent
virtue
and
very
useful
in
every
walk
of
life
goodness
a
person
is
good
when
he
is
willing
to
help
others
in
their
need
faith
in
listing
faith
among
the
fruits
of
the
spirit
paul
obviously
does
not
mean
faith
in
christ
but
faith
in
men
such
faith
is
not
suspicious
of
people
but
believes
the
best
naturally
the
possessor
of
such
faith
will
be
deceived
but
he
lets
it
pass
he
is
ready
to
believe
all
men
but
he
will
not
trust
all
men
where
this
virtue
is
lacking
men
are
suspicious
forward
and
wayward
and
will
believe
nothing
nor
yield
to
anybody
no
matter
how
well
a
person
says
or
does
anything
they
will
find
fault
with
it
and
if
you
do
not
humor
them
you
can
never
please
them
it
is
quite
impossible
to
get
along
with
them
such
faith
in
people
therefore
is
quite
necessary
what
kind
of
life
would
this
be
if
one
person
could
not
believe
another
person
meekness
a
person
is
meek
when
he
is
not
quick
to
get
angry
many
things
occur
in
daily
life
to
provoke
a
person
anger
but
the
christian
gets
over
his
anger
by
meekness
temperance
christians
are
to
lead
sober
and
chaste
lives
they
should
not
be
adulterers
fornicators
or
sensualists
they
should
not
be
quarrelers
or
drunkards
in
the
first
and
second
chapters
of
the
epistle
to
titus
the
apostle
admonishes
bishops
young
women
and
married
folks
to
be
chaste
and
pure
verse
against
such
there
is
no
law
there
is
a
law
of
course
but
it
does
not
apply
to
those
who
bear
these
fruits
of
the
spirit
the
law
is
not
given
for
the
righteous
man
a
true
christian
conducts
himself
in
such
a
way
that
he
does
not
need
any
law
to
warn
or
to
restrain
him
he
obeys
the
law
without
compulsion
the
law
does
not
concern
him
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
there
would
not
have
to
be
any
law
verse
and
they
that
are
christ
have
crucified
the
flesh
with
the
affections
and
lusts
true
believers
are
no
hypocrites
they
crucify
the
flesh
with
its
evil
desires
and
lusts
inasmuch
as
they
have
not
altogether
put
off
the
sinful
flesh
they
are
inclined
to
sin
they
do
not
fear
or
love
god
as
they
should
they
are
likely
to
be
provoked
to
anger
to
envy
to
impatience
to
carnal
lust
and
other
emotions
but
they
will
not
do
the
things
to
which
the
flesh
incites
them
they
crucify
the
flesh
with
its
evil
desires
and
lusts
by
fasting
and
exercise
and
above
all
by
a
walk
in
the
spirit
to
resist
the
flesh
in
this
manner
is
to
nail
it
to
the
cross
although
the
flesh
is
still
alive
it
can
not
very
well
act
upon
its
desires
because
it
is
bound
and
nailed
to
the
cross
verse
if
we
live
in
the
spirit
let
us
also
walk
in
the
spirit
a
little
while
ago
the
apostle
had
condemned
those
who
are
envious
and
start
heresies
and
schisms
as
if
he
had
forgotten
that
he
had
already
berated
them
the
apostle
once
more
reproves
those
who
provoke
and
envy
others
was
not
one
reference
to
them
sufficient
he
repeats
his
admonition
in
order
to
emphasize
the
viciousness
of
pride
that
had
caused
all
the
trouble
in
the
churches
of
galatia
and
has
always
caused
the
church
of
christ
no
end
of
difficulties
in
his
epistle
to
titus
the
apostle
states
that
a
vainglorious
man
should
not
be
ordained
as
a
minister
for
pride
as
augustine
points
out
is
the
mother
of
all
heresies
now
vainglory
has
always
been
a
common
poison
in
the
world
there
is
no
village
too
small
to
contain
someone
who
wants
to
be
considered
wiser
or
better
than
the
rest
those
who
have
been
bitten
by
pride
usually
stand
upon
the
reputation
for
learning
and
wisdom
vainglory
is
not
nearly
so
bad
in
a
private
person
or
even
in
an
official
as
it
is
in
a
minister
when
the
poison
of
vainglory
gets
into
the
church
you
have
no
idea
what
havoc
it
can
cause
you
may
argue
about
knowledge
art
money
countries
and
the
like
without
doing
particular
harm
but
you
can
not
quarrel
about
salvation
or
damnation
about
eternal
life
and
eternal
death
without
grave
damage
to
the
church
no
wonder
paul
exhorts
all
ministers
of
the
word
to
guard
against
this
poison
he
writes
if
we
live
in
the
spirit
where
the
spirit
is
men
gain
new
attitudes
where
formerly
they
were
vainglorious
spiteful
and
envious
they
now
become
humble
gentle
and
patient
such
men
seek
not
their
own
glory
but
the
glory
of
god
they
do
not
provoke
each
other
to
wrath
or
envy
but
prefer
others
to
themselves
as
dangerous
to
the
church
as
this
abominable
pride
is
yet
there
is
nothing
more
common
the
trouble
with
the
ministers
of
satan
is
that
they
look
upon
the
ministry
as
a
to
fame
and
glory
and
right
there
you
have
the
seed
for
all
sorts
of
dissensions
because
paul
knew
that
the
vainglory
of
the
false
apostles
had
caused
the
churches
of
galatia
endless
trouble
he
makes
it
his
business
to
suppress
this
abominable
vice
in
his
absence
the
false
apostles
went
to
work
in
galatia
they
pretended
that
they
had
been
on
intimate
terms
with
the
apostles
while
paul
had
never
seen
christ
in
person
or
had
much
contact
with
the
rest
of
the
apostles
because
of
this
they
delivered
him
rejected
his
doctrine
and
boosted
their
own
in
this
way
they
troubled
the
galatians
and
caused
quarrels
among
them
until
they
provoked
and
envied
each
other
which
goes
to
show
that
neither
the
false
apostles
nor
the
galatians
walked
after
the
spirit
but
after
the
flesh
the
gospel
is
not
there
for
us
to
aggrandize
ourselves
the
gospel
is
to
aggrandize
christ
and
the
mercy
of
god
it
holds
out
to
men
eternal
gifts
that
are
not
gifts
of
our
own
manufacture
what
right
have
we
to
receive
praise
and
glory
for
gifts
that
are
not
of
our
own
making
no
wonder
that
god
in
his
special
grace
subjects
the
ministers
of
the
gospel
to
all
kinds
of
afflictions
otherwise
they
could
not
cope
with
this
ugly
beast
called
vainglory
if
no
persecution
no
cross
or
reproach
trailed
the
doctrine
of
the
gospel
but
only
praise
and
reputation
the
ministers
of
the
gospel
would
choke
with
pride
paul
had
the
spirit
of
christ
nevertheless
there
was
given
unto
him
the
messenger
of
satan
to
buffet
him
in
order
that
he
should
not
come
to
exalt
himself
because
of
the
grandeur
of
his
revelations
augustine
opinion
is
well
taken
if
a
minister
of
the
gospel
is
praised
he
is
in
danger
if
he
is
despised
he
is
also
in
danger
the
ministers
of
the
gospel
should
be
men
who
are
not
too
easily
affected
by
praise
or
criticism
but
simply
speak
out
the
benefit
and
the
glory
of
christ
and
seek
the
salvation
of
souls
whenever
you
are
being
praised
remember
it
is
not
you
who
is
being
praised
but
christ
to
whom
all
praise
belongs
when
you
preach
the
word
of
god
in
its
purity
and
also
live
accordingly
it
is
not
your
own
doing
but
god
doing
and
when
people
praise
you
they
really
mean
to
praise
god
in
you
when
you
understand
this
and
you
should
because
what
hast
thou
that
thou
didst
not
receive
you
will
not
flatter
yourself
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
you
will
not
carry
yourself
with
the
thought
of
resigning
from
the
ministry
when
you
are
insulted
reproached
or
persecuted
it
is
really
kind
of
god
to
send
so
much
infamy
reproach
hatred
and
cursing
our
way
to
keep
us
from
getting
proud
of
the
gifts
of
god
in
us
we
need
a
millstone
around
our
neck
to
keep
us
humble
there
are
a
few
on
our
side
who
love
and
revere
us
for
the
ministry
of
the
word
but
for
every
one
of
these
there
are
a
hundred
on
the
other
side
who
hate
and
persecute
us
the
lord
is
our
glory
such
gifts
as
we
possess
we
acknowledge
to
be
the
gifts
of
god
given
to
us
for
the
good
of
the
church
of
christ
therefore
we
are
not
proud
because
of
them
we
know
that
more
is
required
of
them
to
whom
much
is
given
than
of
such
to
whom
little
is
given
we
also
know
that
god
is
no
respecter
of
persons
a
plain
factory
hand
who
does
his
work
faithfully
pleases
god
just
as
much
as
a
minister
of
the
word
verse
let
us
not
be
desirous
of
vain
glory
to
desire
vainglory
is
to
desire
lies
because
when
one
person
praises
another
he
tells
lies
what
is
there
in
anybody
to
praise
but
it
is
different
when
the
ministry
is
praised
we
should
not
only
desire
people
to
praise
the
ministry
of
the
gospel
but
also
do
our
utmost
to
make
the
ministry
worthy
of
praise
because
this
will
make
the
ministry
more
effective
paul
warns
the
romans
not
to
bring
christianity
into
disrepute
let
not
then
your
good
be
evil
spoken
of
rom
he
also
begged
the
corinthians
to
give
no
offense
in
anything
that
the
ministry
be
not
blamed
i
cor
when
people
praise
our
ministry
they
are
not
praising
our
persons
but
god
verse
provoking
one
another
envying
one
another
such
is
the
ill
effect
of
vainglory
those
who
teach
errors
provoke
others
when
others
disapprove
and
reject
the
doctrine
the
teachers
of
errors
get
angry
in
turn
and
then
you
have
strife
and
trouble
the
sectarians
hate
us
furiously
because
we
will
not
approve
their
errors
we
did
not
attack
them
directly
we
merely
called
attention
to
certain
abuses
in
the
church
they
did
not
like
it
and
became
sore
at
us
because
it
hurt
their
pride
they
wish
to
be
the
lone
rulers
of
the
church
chapter
verse
brethren
if
a
man
be
overtaken
in
a
fault
ye
which
are
spiritual
restore
such
an
one
in
the
spirit
of
meekness
if
we
carefully
weigh
the
words
of
the
apostle
we
perceive
that
he
does
not
speak
of
doctrinal
faults
and
errors
but
of
much
lesser
faults
by
which
a
person
is
overtaken
through
the
weakness
of
his
flesh
this
explains
why
the
apostle
chooses
the
softer
term
fault
to
minimize
the
offense
still
more
as
if
he
meant
to
excuse
it
altogether
and
to
take
the
whole
blame
away
from
the
person
who
has
committed
the
fault
he
speaks
of
him
as
having
been
overtaken
seduced
by
the
devil
and
of
the
flesh
as
if
he
meant
to
say
what
is
more
human
than
for
a
human
being
to
fall
to
be
deceived
and
to
err
this
comforting
sentence
at
one
time
saved
my
life
because
satan
always
assails
both
the
purity
of
doctrine
which
he
endeavors
to
take
away
by
schisms
and
the
purity
of
life
which
he
spoils
with
his
continual
temptations
to
sin
paul
explains
how
the
fallen
should
be
treated
those
who
are
strong
are
to
raise
up
the
fallen
in
the
spirit
of
meekness
this
ought
to
be
borne
in
mind
particularly
by
the
ministers
of
the
word
in
order
that
they
may
not
forget
the
parental
attitude
which
paul
here
requires
of
those
who
have
the
keeping
of
souls
pastors
and
ministers
must
of
course
rebuke
the
fallen
but
when
they
see
that
the
fallen
are
sorry
they
are
to
comfort
them
by
excusing
the
fault
as
well
as
they
can
as
unyielding
as
the
holy
spirit
is
in
the
matter
of
maintaining
and
defending
the
doctrine
of
faith
so
mild
and
merciful
is
he
toward
men
for
their
sins
as
long
as
sinners
repent
the
pope
synagogue
teaches
the
exact
opposite
of
what
the
apostle
commands
the
clerics
are
tyrants
and
butchers
of
men
conscience
every
small
offense
is
closely
scrutinized
to
justify
the
cruel
inquisitiveness
they
quote
the
statement
of
pope
gregory
it
is
the
property
of
good
lives
to
be
afraid
of
a
fault
where
there
is
no
fault
our
censors
must
be
feared
even
if
they
are
unjust
and
wrong
on
these
pronouncements
the
papists
base
their
doctrine
of
excommunication
rather
than
terrify
and
condemn
men
consciences
they
ought
to
raise
them
up
and
comfort
them
with
the
truth
let
the
ministers
of
the
gospel
learn
from
paul
how
to
deal
with
those
who
have
sinned
brethren
he
says
if
any
man
be
overtaken
with
a
fault
do
not
aggravate
his
grief
do
not
scold
him
do
not
condemn
him
but
lift
him
up
and
gently
restore
his
faith
if
you
see
a
brother
despondent
over
a
sin
he
has
committed
run
up
to
him
reach
out
your
hand
to
him
comfort
him
with
the
gospel
and
embrace
him
like
a
mother
when
you
meet
a
willful
sinner
who
does
not
care
go
after
him
and
rebuke
him
sharply
but
this
is
not
the
treatment
for
one
who
has
been
overtaken
by
a
sin
and
is
sorry
he
must
be
dealt
with
in
the
spirit
of
meekness
and
not
in
the
spirit
of
severity
a
repentant
sinner
is
not
to
be
given
gall
and
vinegar
to
drink
verse
considering
thyself
lest
thou
also
be
tempted
this
consideration
is
very
much
needed
to
put
a
stop
to
the
severity
of
some
pastors
who
show
the
fallen
no
mercy
augustine
says
there
is
no
sin
which
one
person
has
committed
that
another
person
may
not
commit
it
also
we
stand
in
slippery
places
if
we
become
overbearing
and
neglect
our
duty
it
is
easy
enough
to
fall
into
sin
in
the
book
entitled
the
lives
of
our
fathers
one
of
the
fathers
is
reported
to
have
said
when
informed
that
a
brother
had
fallen
into
adultery
he
fell
yesterday
i
may
fall
today
paul
therefore
warns
the
pastors
not
to
be
too
rigorous
and
unmerciful
towards
offenders
but
to
show
them
every
affection
always
remembering
this
man
fell
into
sin
i
may
fall
into
worse
sin
if
those
who
are
always
so
eager
to
condemn
others
would
investigate
themselves
they
would
find
that
the
sins
of
others
are
motes
in
comparison
to
their
own
wherefore
let
him
that
thinketh
he
standeth
take
heed
lest
he
fall
i
cor
if
david
who
was
a
hero
of
faith
and
did
so
many
great
things
for
the
lord
could
fall
so
badly
that
in
spite
of
his
advanced
age
he
was
overcome
by
youthful
lust
after
he
had
withstood
so
many
different
temptations
with
which
the
lord
had
tested
his
faith
who
are
we
to
think
that
we
are
more
stable
these
object
lessons
of
god
should
convince
us
that
of
all
things
god
hates
pride
verse
bear
ye
one
another
burdens
and
so
fulfill
the
law
of
christ
the
law
of
christ
is
the
law
of
love
christ
gave
us
no
other
law
than
this
law
of
mutual
love
a
new
commandment
i
give
unto
you
that
ye
love
one
another
to
love
means
to
bear

burdens
christians
must
have
strong
shoulders
to
bear
the
burdens
of
their
fellow
christians
faithful
pastors
recognize
many
errors
and
offenses
in
the
church
which
they
oversee
in
civil
affairs
an
official
has
to
overlook
much
if
he
is
fit
to
rule
if
we
can
overlook
our
own
shortcomings
and
we
ought
to
overlook
the
shortcomings
of
others
in
accordance
with
the
words
bear
ye
one
another
burdens
those
who
fail
to
do
so
expose
their
lack
of
understanding
of
the
law
of
christ
love
according
to
paul
believeth
all
things
hopeth
all
things
endureth
all
things
this
commandment
is
not
meant
for
those
who
deny
christ
neither
is
it
meant
for
those
who
continue
to
live
in
sin
only
those
who
are
willing
to
hear
the
word
of
god
and
then
inadvertently
fall
into
sin
to
their
own
great
sorrow
and
regret
carry
the
burdens
which
the
apostle
encourages
us
to
bear
let
us
not
be
hard
on
them
if
christ
did
not
punish
them
what
right
have
we
to
do
it
verse
for
if
a
man
think
himself
to
be
something
when
he
is
nothing
he
deceiveth
himself
again
the
apostle
takes
the
authors
of
sects
to
task
for
being
tyrants
they
despise
the
weak
and
demand
that
everything
be
just
so
nothing
suits
them
except
what
they
do
unless
you
eulogize
whatever
they
say
or
do
unless
you
adapt
yourself
to
their
slightest
whim
they
become
angry
with
you
they
are
that
way
because
as
paul
says
they
think
themselves
to
be
something
they
think
they
know
all
about
the
scriptures
paul
has
their
number
when
he
calls
them
zeros
they
deceive
themselves
with
their
wisdom
and
holiness
they
have
no
understanding
of
christ
or
the
law
of
christ
by
insisting
that
everything
be
perfect
they
not
only
fail
to
bear
the
burdens
of
the
weak
they
actually
offend
the
weak
by
their
severity
people
begin
to
hate
and
shun
them
and
refuse
to
accept
counsel
or
comfort
from
them
paul
describes
these
stiff
and
ungracious
saints
accurately
when
he
says
of
them
they
think
themselves
to
be
something
bloated
by
their
own
silly
ideas
and
schemes
they
entertain
a
pretty
fair
opinion
of
themselves
when
in
reality
they
amount
to
nothing
verse
but
let
every
man
prove
his
own
work
and
then
shall
he
have
rejoicing
in
himself
alone
and
not
in
another
in
this
verse
the
apostle
continues
his
attack
upon
the
vainglorious
sectarians
although
this
passage
may
be
applied
to
any
work
the
apostle
has
in
mind
particularly
the
work
of
the
ministry
the
trouble
with
these
seekers
after
glory
is
that
they
never
stop
to
consider
whether
their
ministry
is
straightforward
and
faithful
all
they
think
about
is
whether
people
will
like
and
praise
them
theirs
is
a
threefold
sin
first
they
are
greedy
of
praise
secondly
they
are
very
sly
and
wily
in
suggesting
that
the
ministry
of
other
pastors
is
not
what
it
should
be
by
way
of
contrast
they
hope
to
rise
in
the
estimation
of
the
people
thirdly
once
they
have
established
a
reputation
for
themselves
they
become
so
chesty
that
they
stop
short
of
nothing
when
they
have
won
the
praise
of
men
pride
leads
them
on
to
belittle
the
work
of
other
men
and
to
applaud
their
own
in
this
artful
manner
they
hoodwink
the
people
who
rather
enjoy
to
see
their
former
pastors
taken
down
a
few
notches
by
such
upstarts
let
a
minister
be
faithful
in
his
office
is
the
apostolic
injunction
let
him
not
seek
his
own
glory
or
look
for
praise
let
him
desire
to
do
good
work
and
to
preach
the
gospel
in
all
its
purity
whether
an
ungrateful
world
appreciates
his
efforts
is
to
give
him
no
concern
because
after
all
he
is
in
the
ministry
not
for
his
own
glory
but
for
the
glory
of
christ
a
faithful
minister
cares
little
what
people
think
of
him
as
long
as
his
conscience
approves
of
him
the
approval
of
his
own
good
conscience
is
the
best
praise
a
minister
can
have
to
know
that
we
have
taught
the
word
of
god
and
administered
the
sacraments
rightly
is
to
have
a
glory
that
can
not
be
taken
away
the
glory
which
the
sectarians
seek
is
quite
unstable
because
it
rests
in
the
whim
of
people
if
paul
had
had
to
depend
on
this
kind
of
glory
for
his
ministry
he
would
have
despaired
when
he
saw
the
many
offenses
and
evils
following
in
the
wake
of
his
preaching
if
we
had
to
feel
that
the
success
of
our
ministry
depended
upon
our
popularity
with
men
we
would
die
because
we
are
not
popular
on
the
contrary
we
are
hated
by
the
whole
world
with
rare
bitterness
nobody
praises
us
everybody
finds
fault
with
us
but
we
can
glory
in
the
lord
and
attend
to
our
work
cheerfully
who
cares
whether
our
efforts
please
or
displease
the
devil
who
cares
whether
the
world
praises
or
hates
us
we
go
ahead
by
honour
and
dishonour
by
evil
report
and
good
report
ii
cor
the
gospel
entails
persecution
the
gospel
is
that
kind
of
a
doctrine
furthermore
the
disciples
of
the
gospel
are
not
all
dependable
many
embrace
the
gospel
today
and
tomorrow
discard
it
to
preach
the
gospel
for
praise
is
bad
business
especially
when
people
stop
praising
you
find
your
praise
in
the
testimony
of
a
good
conscience
this
passage
may
also
be
applied
to
other
work
besides
the
ministry
when
an
official
a
servant
a
teacher
minds
his
business
and
performs
his
duty
faithfully
without
concerning
himself
about
matters
that
are
not
in
his
line
he
may
rejoice
in
himself
the
best
commendation
of
any
work
is
to
know
that
one
has
done
the
work
that
god
has
given
him
well
and
that
god
is
pleased
with
his
effort
verse
every
man
shall
bear
his
own
burden
that
means
for
anybody
to
covet
praise
is
foolish
because
the
praise
of
men
will
be
of
no
help
to
you
in
the
hour
of
death
before
the
judgment
throne
of
christ
everybody
will
have
to
bear
his
own
burden
as
it
is
the
praise
of
men
stops
when
we
die
before
the
eternal
judge
it
is
not
praise
that
counts
but
your
own
conscience
true
the
consciousness
of
work
well
done
can
not
quiet
the
conscience
but
it
is
well
to
have
the
testimony
of
a
good
conscience
in
the
last
judgment
that
we
have
performed
our
duty
faithfully
in
accordance
with
god
will
for
the
suppression
of
pride
we
need
the
strength
of
prayer
what
man
even
if
he
is
a
christian
is
not
delighted
with
his
own
praise
only
the
holy
spirit
can
preserve
us
from
the
misfortune
of
pride
verse
let
him
that
is
taught
in
the
word
communicate
unto
him
that
teacheth
in
all
good
things
now
the
apostle
also
addresses
the
hearers
of
the
word
requesting
them
to
bestow
all
good
things
upon
those
who
have
taught
them
the
gospel
i
have
often
wondered
why
all
the
apostles
reiterated
this
request
with
such
embarrassing
frequency
in
the
papacy
i
saw
the
people
give
generously
for
the
erection
and
maintenance
of
luxurious
church
buildings
and
for
the
sustenance
of
men
appointed
to
the
idolatrous
service
of
rome
i
saw
bishops
and
priests
grow
rich
until
they
possessed
the
choicest
real
estate
i
thought
then
that
admonitions
were
overdone
i
thought
he
should
have
requested
the
people
to
curtail
their
contributions
i
saw
how
the
generosity
of
the
people
of
the
church
was
encouraging
covetousness
on
the
part
of
the
clergy
i
know
better
now
as
often
as
i
read
the
admonitions
of
the
apostle
to
the
effect
that
the
churches
should
support
their
pastors
and
raise
funds
for
the
relief
of
impoverished
christians
i
am
half
ashamed
to
think
that
the
great
apostle
paul
had
to
touch
upon
this
subject
so
frequently
in
writing
to
the
corinthians
he
needed
two
chapters
to
impress
this
matter
upon
them
i
would
not
want
to
discredit
wittenberg
as
paul
discredited
the
corinthians
by
urging
them
at
such
length
to
contribute
to
the
relief
of
the
poor
it
seems
to
be
a
of
the
gospel
that
nobody
wants
to
contribute
to
the
maintenance
of
the
gospel
ministry
when
the
doctrine
of
the
devil
is
preached
people
are
prodigal
in
their
willing
support
of
those
who
deceive
them
we
have
come
to
understand
why
it
is
so
necessary
to
repeat
the
admonition
of
this
verse
when
satan
can
not
suppress
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
by
force
he
tries
to
accomplish
his
purpose
by
striking
the
ministers
of
the
gospel
with
poverty
he
curtails
their
income
to
such
an
extent
that
they
are
forced
out
of
the
ministry
because
they
can
not
live
by
the
gospel
without
ministers
to
proclaim
the
word
of
god
the
people
go
wild
like
savage
beasts
paul
admonition
that
the
hearers
of
the
gospel
share
all
good
things
with
their
pastors
and
teachers
is
certainly
in
order
to
the
corinthians
he
wrote
if
we
have
sown
unto
you
spiritual
things
is
it
a
great
thing
if
we
shall
reap
your
carnal
things
i
cor
in
the
old
days
when
the
pope
reigned
supreme
everybody
paid
plenty
for
masses
the
begging
friars
brought
in
their
share
commercial
priests
counted
the
daily
offerings
from
these
extortions
our
countrymen
are
now
delivered
by
the
gospel
you
would
think
they
would
be
grateful
for
their
emancipation
and
give
generously
for
the
support
of
the
ministry
of
the
gospel
and
the
relief
of
impoverished
christians
instead
they
rob
christ
when
the
members
of
a
christian
congregation
permit
their
pastor
to
struggle
along
in
penury
they
are
worse
than
heathen
before
very
long
they
are
going
to
suffer
for
their
ingratitude
they
will
lose
their
temporal
and
spiritual
possessions
this
sin
merits
the
severest
punishment
the
reason
why
the
churches
of
galatia
corinth
and
other
places
were
troubled
by
false
apostles
was
this
that
they
had
so
little
regard
for
their
faithful
ministers
you
can
not
refuse
to
give
a
penny
who
gives
you
all
good
things
even
life
eternal
and
turn
around
and
give
the
devil
the
giver
of
all
evil
and
death
eternal
pieces
of
gold
and
not
be
punished
for
it
the
words
in
all
good
things
are
not
to
be
understood
to
mean
that
people
are
to
give
all
they
have
to
their
ministers
but
that
they
should
support
them
liberally
and
give
them
enough
to
live
well
verse
be
not
deceived
god
is
not
mocked
the
apostle
is
so
worked
up
over
this
matter
that
he
is
not
content
with
a
mere
admonition
he
utters
the
threatening
words
god
is
not
mocked
our
countrymen
think
it
good
sport
to
despise
the
ministry
they
like
to
treat
the
ministers
like
servants
and
slaves
be
not
deceived
warns
the
apostle
god
is
not
mocked
god
will
not
be
mocked
in
his
ministers
christ
said
he
that
despiseth
you
despiseth
me
luke
to
samuel
god
said
they
have
not
rejected
thee
but
they
have
rejected
me
i
sam
be
careful
you
scoffers
god
may
postpone
his
punishment
for
a
time
but
he
will
find
you
out
in
time
and
punish
you
for
despising
his
servants
you
can
not
laugh
at
god
maybe
the
people
are
little
impressed
by
the
threats
of
god
but
in
the
hour
of
their
death
they
shall
know
whom
they
have
mocked
god
is
not
ever
going
to
let
his
ministers
starve
when
the
rich
suffer
the
pangs
of
hunger
god
will
feed
his
own
servants
in
the
days
of
famine
they
shall
be
satisfied
ps
verse
for
whatever
a
man
soweth
that
shall
he
also
reap
these
passages
are
all
meant
to
benefit
us
ministers
i
must
say
i
do
not
find
much
pleasure
in
explaining
these
verses
i
am
made
to
appear
as
if
i
am
speaking
for
my
own
benefit
if
a
minister
preaches
on
money
he
is
likely
to
be
accused
of
covetousness
still
people
must
be
told
these
things
that
they
may
know
their
duty
over
against
their
pastors
our
savior
says
eating
and
drinking
such
things
as
they
give
for
the
laborer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
luke
and
paul
says
elsewhere
do
ye
not
know
that
they
which
minister
about
holy
things
live
of
the
things
of
the
temple
and
they
which
wait
at
the
altar
are
partakers
with
the
altar
even
so
hath
the
lord
ordained
that
they
which
preach
the
gospel
should
live
of
the
gospel
i
cor
verse
for
he
that
soweth
to
his
flesh
shall
of
the
flesh
reap
corruption
but
he
that
soweth
to
the
spirit
shall
of
the
spirit
reap
everlasting
life
this
simile
of
sowing
and
reaping
also
refers
to
the
proper
support
of
ministers
he
that
soweth
to
the
spirit
he
that
honors
the
ministers
of
god
is
doing
a
spiritual
thing
and
will
reap
everlasting
life
he
that
soweth
to
the
flesh
he
that
has
nothing
left
for
the
ministers
of
god
but
only
thinks
of
himself
that
person
will
reap
of
the
flesh
corruption
not
only
in
this
life
but
also
in
the
life
to
come
the
apostle
wants
to
stir
up
his
readers
to
be
generous
to
their
pastors
that
the
ministers
of
the
church
need
support
any
man
with
common
sense
can
see
though
this
support
is
something
physical
the
apostle
does
not
hesitate
to
call
it
sowing
to
the
spirit
when
people
scrape
up
everything
they
can
lay
their
hands
on
and
keep
everything
for
themselves
the
apostle
calls
it
a
sowing
to
the
flesh
he
pronounces
those
who
sow
to
the
spirit
blessed
for
this
life
and
the
life
to
come
while
those
who
sow
to
the
flesh
are
accursed
now
and
forever
verse
and
let
us
not
be
weary
in
well
doing
for
in
due
season
we
shall
reap
if
we
faint
not
the
apostle
intends
soon
to
close
his
epistle
and
therefore
repeats
once
more
the
general
exhortation
unto
good
deeds
he
means
to
say
let
us
do
good
not
only
to
the
ministers
of
the
gospel
but
to
everybody
and
let
us
do
it
without
weariness
it
is
easy
enough
to
do
good
once
or
twice
but
to
keep
on
doing
good
without
getting
disgusted
with
the
ingratitude
of
those
whom
we
have
benefited
that
is
not
so
easy
therefore
the
apostle
does
not
only
admonish
us
to
do
good
but
to
do
good
untiringly
for
our
encouragement
he
adds
the
promise
for
in
due
season
we
shall
reap
if
we
faint
not
wait
for
the
harvest
and
then
you
will
reap
the
reward
of
your
sowing
to
the
spirit
think
of
that
when
you
do
good
and
the
ingratitude
of
men
will
not
stop
you
from
doing
good
verse
as
we
have
therefore
opportunity
let
us
do
good
unto
all
men
especially
unto
them
who
are
of
the
household
of
faith
in
this
verse
the
apostle
summarizes
his
instructions
on
the
proper
support
of
the
ministers
and
of
the
poor
he
paraphrases
the
words
of
christ
i
must
work
the
works
of
him
that
sent
me
while
it
is
day
the
night
cometh
when
no
man
can
work
john
our
good
deeds
are
to
be
directed
primarily
at
those
who
share
the
christian
faith
with
us
the
household
of
faith
as
paul
calls
them
among
whom
the
ministers
rank
first
as
objects
of
our
well
doing
verse
ye
see
how
large
a
letter
i
have
written
unto
you
with
mine
own
hand
with
these
words
the
apostle
intends
to
draw
the
galatians
on
i
never
he
says
wrote
such
a
long
letter
with
my
own
hand
to
any
of
the
other
churches
his
other
epistles
he
dictated
and
only
subscribed
his
greetings
and
his
signature
with
his
own
hand
verse
as
many
as
desire
to
make
a
fair
shew
in
the
flesh
they
constrain
you
to
be
circumcised
only
lest
they
should
suffer
persecution
for
the
cross
of
christ
paul
once
more
scores
the
false
apostles
in
an
effort
to
draw
the
galatians
away
from
their
false
doctrine
the
teachers
you
have
now
do
not
seek
the
glory
of
christ
and
the
salvation
of
your
souls
but
only
their
own
glory
they
avoid
the
cross
they
do
not
understand
what
they
teach
these
three
counts
against
the
false
apostles
are
of
so
serious
a
nature
that
no
christian
could
have
fellowship
with
them
but
not
all
the
galatians
obeyed
the
warning
of
paul
the
apostle
attack
upon
the
false
apostles
was
not
unjustified
neither
are
our
attacks
upon
the
papacy
when
we
call
the
pope
the
antichrist
and
his
minions
an
evil
brood
we
do
not
slander
them
we
merely
judge
them
by
the
touchstone
of
god
word
recorded
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
epistle
though
we
or
an
angel
from
heaven
preach
any
other
gospel
unto
you
than
that
which
we
have
preached
unto
you
let
him
be
accursed
verse
for
neither
they
themselves
who
are
circumcised
keep
the
law
but
desire
to
have
you
circumcised
that
they
may
glory
in
your
flesh
in
other
words
i
shall
tell
you
what
kind
of
teachers
you
have
now
they
avoid
the
cross
they
teach
no
certain
truths
they
think
they
are
performing
the
law
but
they
are
not
they
have
not
the
holy
spirit
and
without
him
nobody
can
keep
the
law
where
the
holy
ghost
does
not
dwell
in
men
there
dwells
an
unclean
spirit
a
spirit
that
despises
god
and
turns
every
effort
at
keeping
the
law
into
a
double
sin
mark
what
the
apostle
is
saying
those
who
are
circumcised
do
not
fulfill
the
law
no
person
ever
does
to
work
pray
or
suffer
apart
from
christ
is
to
work
pray
and
to
suffer
in
vain
for
whatsoever
is
not
of
faith
is
sin
it
does
a
person
no
good
to
be
circumcised
to
fast
to
pray
or
to
do
anything
if
in
his
heart
he
despises
christ
why
do
the
false
apostles
insist
that
you
should
be
circumcised
not
for
the
sake
of
your
righteousness
although
they
give
that
impression
but
that
they
may
glory
in
your
flesh
now
what
sort
of
an
ambition
is
that
worst
of
all
they
force
circumcision
upon
you
for
no
other
reason
than
the
satisfaction
they
get
out
of
your
submission
verse
but
god
forbid
that
i
should
glory
save
in
the
cross
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
god
forbid
says
the
apostle
that
i
should
glory
in
anything
as
dangerous
as
the
false
apostles
glory
in
because
what
they
glory
in
is
a
poison
that
destroys
many
souls
and
i
wish
it
were
buried
in
hell
let
them
glory
in
the
flesh
if
they
wish
and
let
them
perish
in
their
glory
as
for
me
i
glory
in
the
cross
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
he
expresses
the
same
sentiment
in
the
fifth
chapter
of
the
epistle
to
the
romans
where
he
says
we
glory
in
tribulations
and
in
the
twelfth
chapter
of
the
second
epistle
to
the
corinthians
most
gladly
therefore
will
l
rather
glory
in
my
infirmities
according
to
these
expressions
the
glory
of
a
christian
consists
in
tribulations
reproaches
and
infirmities
and
this
is
our
glory
today
with
the
pope
and
the
whole
world
persecuting
us
and
trying
to
kill
us
we
know
that
we
suffer
these
things
not
because
we
are
thieves
and
murderers
but
for
christ
sake
whose
gospel
we
proclaim
we
have
no
reason
to
complain
the
world
of
course
looks
upon
us
as
unhappy
and
accursed
creatures
but
christ
for
whose
sake
we
suffer
pronounces
us
blessed
and
bids
us
to
rejoice
blessed
are
ye
says
he
when
men
shall
revile
you
and
persecute
you
and
shall
say
all
manner
of
evil
against
you
falsely
for
my
sake
rejoice
and
be
exceeding
glad
matt
by
the
cross
of
christ
is
not
to
be
understood
here
the
two
pieces
of
wood
to
which
he
was
nailed
but
all
the
afflictions
of
the
believers
whose
sufferings
are
christ
sufferings
elsewhere
paul
writes
who
now
rejoice
in
my
sufferings
for
you
and
fill
up
that
which
is
behind
of
the
afflictions
of
christ
in
my
flesh
for
his
body
sake
which
is
the
church
col
it
is
good
for
us
to
know
this
lest
we
sink
into
despair
when
our
opponents
persecute
us
let
us
bear
the
cross
for
christ
sake
it
will
ease
our
sufferings
and
make
them
light
as
christ
says
matthew
my
yoke
is
easy
and
my
burden
is
light
verse
by
whom
the
world
is
crucified
unto
me
and
i
unto
the
world
the
world
is
crucified
unto
me
means
that
i
condemn
the
world
i
am
crucified
unto
the
world
means
that
the
world
in
turn
condemns
me
i
detest
the
doctrine
the
and
the
works
of
the
world
the
world
in
turn
detests
my
doctrine
and
condemns
me
as
a
revolutionary
heretic
thus
the
world
is
crucified
unto
us
and
we
unto
the
world
the
monks
imagined
the
world
was
crucified
unto
them
when
they
entered
the
monastery
not
the
world
but
christ
is
crucified
in
the
monasteries
in
this
verse
paul
expresses
his
hatred
of
the
world
the
hatred
was
mutual
as
paul
so
we
are
to
despise
the
world
and
the
devil
with
christ
on
our
side
we
can
defy
him
and
say
satan
the
more
you
hurt
me
the
more
i
oppose
you
verse
for
in
christ
jesus
neither
circumcision
availeth
anything
nor
uncircumcision
but
a
new
creature
since
circumcision
and
uncircumcision
are
contrary
matters
we
would
expect
the
apostle
to
say
that
one
or
the
other
might
accomplish
some
good
but
he
denies
that
either
of
them
do
any
good
both
are
of
no
value
because
in
christ
jesus
neither
circumcision
nor
uncircumcision
avail
anything
reason
fails
to
understand
this
for
the
natural
man
receiveth
not
the
things
of
the
spirit
of
god
i
cor
it
therefore
seeks
righteousness
in
externals
however
we
learn
from
the
word
of
god
that
there
is
nothing
under
the
sun
that
can
make
us
righteous
before
god
and
a
new
creature
except
christ
jesus
a
new
creature
is
one
in
whom
the
image
of
god
has
been
renewed
such
a
creature
can
not
be
brought
into
life
by
good
works
but
by
christ
alone
good
works
may
improve
the
outward
appearance
but
they
can
not
produce
a
new
creature
a
new
creature
is
the
work
of
the
holy
ghost
who
imbues
our
hearts
with
faith
love
and
other
christian
virtues
grants
us
the
strength
to
subdue
the
flesh
and
to
reject
the
righteousness
of
the
world
verse
and
as
many
as
walk
according
to
this
rule
peace
be
on
them
and
mercy
this
is
the
rule
by
which
we
ought
to
live
that
ye
put
on
the
new
man
which
after
god
is
created
in
righteousness
and
true
holiness
eph
those
who
walk
after
this
rule
enjoy
the
favor
of
god
the
forgiveness
of
their
sins
and
peace
of
conscience
should
they
ever
be
overtaken
by
any
sin
the
mercy
of
god
supports
them
verse
from
henceforth
let
no
man
trouble
me
the
apostle
speaks
these
words
with
a
certain
amount
of
indignation
i
have
preached
the
gospel
to
you
in
conformity
with
the
revelation
which
i
received
from
jesus
christ
if
you
do
not
care
for
it
very
well
trouble
me
no
more
trouble
me
no
more
verse
for
i
bear
in
my
body
the
marks
of
the
lord
jesus
the
marks
on
my
body
indicate
whose
servant
i
am
if
i
was
anxious
to
please
men
if
i
approved
of
circumcision
and
good
works
as
factors
in
our
salvation
if
i
would
take
delight
in
your
flesh
as
the
false
apostles
do
i
would
not
have
these
marks
on
my
body
but
because
i
am
the
servant
of
jesus
christ
and
publicly
declare
that
no
person
can
obtain
the
salvation
of
his
soul
outside
of
christ
i
must
bear
the
badge
of
my
lord
these
marks
were
given
to
me
against
my
will
as
decorations
from
the
devil
and
for
no
other
merit
but
that
i
made
known
jesus
of
the
marks
of
suffering
which
he
bore
in
his
body
the
apostle
makes
frequent
mention
in
his
epistles
i
think
he
says
that
god
hath
set
forth
us
the
apostles
last
as
it
were
appointed
to
death
for
we
are
made
a
spectacle
unto
the
world
and
to
angels
and
to
men
i
cor
again
unto
this
present
hour
we
both
hunger
and
thirst
and
are
naked
and
are
buffeted
and
have
no
certain
and
labour
working
with
our
hands
being
reviled
we
bless
being
persecuted
we
suffer
it
being
defamed
we
intreat
we
are
made
as
the
filth
of
the
world
and
are
the
offscouring
of
all
things
unto
this
day
i
cor
verse
brethren
the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
be
with
your
spirit
amen
this
is
the
apostle
farewell
he
ends
his
epistle
as
he
began
it
by
wishing
the
galatians
the
grace
of
god
we
can
hear
him
say
i
have
presented
christ
to
you
i
have
pleaded
with
you
i
have
reproved
you
i
have
overlooked
nothing
that
i
thought
might
be
of
benefit
to
you
all
i
can
do
now
is
to
pray
that
our
lord
jesus
christ
would
bless
my
epistle
and
grant
you
the
guidance
of
the
holy
ghost
the
lord
jesus
christ
our
savior
who
gave
me
the
strength
and
the
grace
to
explain
this
epistle
and
granted
you
the
grace
to
hear
it
preserve
and
strengthen
us
in
faith
unto
the
day
of
our
redemption
to
him
the
father
and
the
son
and
the
holy
spirit
be
glory

without
