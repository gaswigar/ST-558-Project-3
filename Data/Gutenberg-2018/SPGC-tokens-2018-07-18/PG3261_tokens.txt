discussion
and
bed
up
at
the
league
says
a
friend
there
had
been
one
night
a
brisk
conversational
discussion
as
to
what
would
happen
on
the
morrow
of
the
revolution
finally
shading
off
into
a
vigorous
statement
by
various
friends
of
their
views
on
the
future
of
the
new
society
says
our
friend
considering
the
subject
the
discussion
was
for
those
present
being
used
to
public
meetings
and
lecture
debates
if
they
did
not
listen
to
each
others
opinions
which
could
scarcely
be
expected
of
them
at
all
events
did
not
always
attempt
to
speak
all
together
as
is
the
custom
of
people
in
ordinary
polite
society
when
conversing
on
a
subject
which
interests
them
for
the
rest
there
were
six
persons
present
and
consequently
six
sections
of
the
party
were
represented
four
of
which
had
strong
but
divergent
anarchist
opinions
one
of
the
sections
says
our
friend
a
man
whom
he
knows
very
well
indeed
sat
almost
silent
at
the
beginning
of
the
discussion
but
at
last
got
drawn
into
it
and
finished
by
roaring
out
very
loud
and
damning
all
the
rest
for
fools
after
which
befel
a
period
of
noise
and
then
a
lull
during
which
the
aforesaid
section
having
said
very
amicably
took
his
way
home
by
himself
to
a
western
suburb
using
the
means
of
travelling
which
civilisation
has
forced
upon
us
like
a
habit
as
he
sat
in
that
of
hurried
and
discontented
humanity
a
carriage
of
the
underground
railway
he
like
others
stewed
discontentedly
while
in
mood
he
turned
over
the
many
excellent
and
conclusive
arguments
which
though
they
lay
at
his
ends
he
had
forgotten
in
the
just
past
discussion
but
this
frame
of
mind
he
was
so
used
to
that
it
did
last
him
long
and
after
a
brief
discomfort
caused
by
disgust
with
himself
for
having
lost
his
temper
which
he
was
also
well
used
to
he
found
himself
musing
on
the
matter
of
discussion
but
still
discontentedly
and
unhappily
if
i
could
but
see
a
day
of
it
he
said
to
himself
if
i
could
but
see
it
as
he
formed
the
words
the
train
stopped
at
his
station
five
walk
from
his
own
house
which
stood
on
the
banks
of
the
thames
a
little
way
above
an
ugly
suspension
bridge
he
went
out
of
the
station
still
discontented
and
unhappy
muttering
if
i
could
but
see
it
if
i
could
but
see
it
but
had
not
gone
many
steps
towards
the
river
before
says
our
friend
who
tells
the
story
all
that
discontent
and
trouble
seemed
to
slip
off
him
it
was
a
beautiful
night
of
early
winter
the
air
just
sharp
enough
to
be
refreshing
after
the
hot
room
and
the
stinking
railway
carriage
the
wind
which
had
lately
turned
a
point
or
two
north
of
west
had
blown
the
sky
clear
of
all
cloud
save
a
light
fleck
or
two
which
went
swiftly
down
the
heavens
there
was
a
young
moon
halfway
up
the
sky
and
as
the
farer
caught
sight
of
it
tangled
in
the
branches
of
a
tall
old
elm
he
could
scarce
bring
to
his
mind
the
shabby
london
suburb
where
he
was
and
he
felt
as
if
he
were
in
a
pleasant
country
place
pleasanter
indeed
than
the
deep
country
was
as
he
had
known
it
he
came
right
down
to
the
and
lingered
a
little
looking
over
the
low
wall
to
note
the
moonlit
river
near
upon
high
water
go
swirling
and
glittering
up
to
chiswick
eyot
as
for
the
ugly
bridge
below
he
did
not
notice
it
or
think
of
it
except
when
for
a
moment
says
our
friend
it
struck
him
that
he
missed
the
row
of
lights
down
stream
then
he
turned
to
his
house
door
and
let
himself
in
and
even
as
he
shut
the
door
to
disappeared
all
remembrance
of
that
brilliant
logic
and
foresight
which
had
so
illuminated
the
recent
discussion
and
of
the
discussion
itself
there
remained
no
trace
save
a
vague
hope
that
was
now
become
a
pleasure
for
days
of
peace
and
rest
and
cleanness
and
smiling
goodwill
in
this
mood
he
tumbled
into
bed
and
fell
asleep
after
his
wont
in
two
minutes
time
but
contrary
to
his
wont
woke
up
again
not
long
after
in
that
curiously
condition
which
sometimes
surprises
even
good
sleepers
a
condition
under
which
we
feel
all
our
wits
preternaturally
sharpened
while
all
the
miserable
muddles
we
have
ever
got
into
all
the
disgraces
and
losses
of
our
lives
will
insist
on
thrusting
themselves
forward
for
the
consideration
of
those
sharpened
wits
in
this
state
he
lay
says
our
friend
till
he
had
almost
begun
to
enjoy
it
till
the
tale
of
his
stupidities
amused
him
and
the
entanglements
before
him
which
he
saw
so
clearly
began
to
shape
themselves
into
an
amusing
story
for
him
he
heard
one
strike
then
two
and
then
three
after
which
he
fell
asleep
again
our
friend
says
that
from
that
sleep
he
awoke
once
more
and
afterwards
went
through
such
surprising
adventures
that
he
thinks
that
they
should
be
told
to
our
comrades
and
indeed
the
public
in
general
and
therefore
proposes
to
tell
them
now
but
says
he
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
i
told
them
in
the
first
person
as
if
it
were
myself
who
had
gone
through
them
which
indeed
will
be
the
easier
and
more
natural
to
me
since
i
understand
the
feelings
and
desires
of
the
comrade
of
whom
i
am
telling
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
does
chapter
ii
a
morning
bath
well
i
awoke
and
found
that
i
had
kicked
my
bedclothes
off
and
no
wonder
for
it
was
hot
and
the
sun
shining
brightly
i
jumped
up
and
washed
and
hurried
on
my
clothes
but
in
a
hazy
and
condition
as
if
i
had
slept
for
a
long
long
while
and
could
not
shake
off
the
weight
of
slumber
in
fact
i
rather
took
it
for
granted
that
i
was
at
home
in
my
own
room
than
saw
that
it
was
so
when
i
was
dressed
i
felt
the
place
so
hot
that
i
made
haste
to
get
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
house
and
my
first
feeling
was
a
delicious
relief
caused
by
the
fresh
air
and
pleasant
breeze
my
second
as
i
began
to
gather
my
wits
together
mere
measureless
wonder
for
it
was
winter
when
i
went
to
bed
the
last
night
and
now
by
witness
of
the
trees
it
was
summer
a
beautiful
bright
morning
seemingly
of
early
june
however
there
was
still
the
thames
sparkling
under
the
sun
and
near
high
water
as
last
night
i
had
seen
it
gleaming
under
the
moon
i
had
by
no
means
shaken
off
the
feeling
of
oppression
and
wherever
i
might
have
been
should
scarce
have
been
quite
conscious
of
the
place
so
it
was
no
wonder
that
i
felt
rather
puzzled
in
despite
of
the
familiar
face
of
the
thames
withal
i
felt
dizzy
and
queer
and
remembering
that
people
often
got
a
boat
and
had
a
swim
in
i
thought
i
would
do
no
less
it
seems
very
early
quoth
i
to
myself
but
i
daresay
i
shall
find
someone
at
biffin
to
take
me
however
i
did
get
as
far
as
biffin
or
even
turn
to
my
left
thitherward
because
just
then
i
began
to
see
that
there
was
a
right
before
me
in
front
of
my
house
in
fact
on
the
place
where
my
neighbour
had
rigged
one
up
though
somehow
it
did
look
like
that
either
down
i
went
on
to
it
and
sure
enough
among
the
empty
boats
moored
to
it
lay
a
man
on
his
sculls
in
a
tub
of
a
boat
clearly
meant
for
bathers
he
nodded
to
me
and
bade
me
as
if
he
expected
me
so
i
jumped
in
without
any
words
and
he
paddled
away
quietly
as
i
peeled
for
my
swim
as
we
went
i
looked
down
on
the
water
and
could
help
saying
how
clear
the
water
is
this
morning
is
it
said
he
i
did
notice
it
you
know
the
always
thickens
it
a
bit
h
said
i
i
have
seen
it
pretty
muddy
even
at
he
said
nothing
in
answer
but
seemed
rather
astonished
and
as
he
now
lay
just
stemming
the
tide
and
i
had
my
clothes
off
i
jumped
in
without
more
ado
of
course
when
i
had
my
head
above
water
again
i
turned
towards
the
tide
and
my
eyes
naturally
sought
for
the
bridge
and
so
utterly
astonished
was
i
by
what
i
saw
that
i
forgot
to
strike
out
and
went
spluttering
under
water
again
and
when
i
came
up
made
straight
for
the
boat
for
i
felt
that
i
must
ask
some
questions
of
my
waterman
so
bewildering
had
been
the
i
had
seen
from
the
face
of
the
river
with
the
water
hardly
out
of
my
eyes
though
by
this
time
i
was
quit
of
the
slumbrous
and
dizzy
feeling
and
was
and
as
i
got
in
up
the
steps
which
he
had
lowered
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
help
me
we
went
drifting
speedily
up
towards
chiswick
but
now
he
caught
up
the
sculls
and
brought
her
head
round
again
and
said
a
short
swim
neighbour
but
perhaps
you
find
the
water
cold
this
morning
after
your
journey
shall
i
put
you
ashore
at
once
or
would
you
like
to
go
down
to
putney
before
breakfast
he
spoke
in
a
way
so
unlike
what
i
should
have
expected
from
a
hammersmith
waterman
that
i
stared
at
him
as
i
answered
please
to
hold
her
a
little
i
want
to
look
about
me
a
bit
all
right
he
said
it
no
less
pretty
in
its
way
here
than
it
is
off
barn
elms
it
jolly
everywhere
this
time
in
the
morning
i
glad
you
got
up
early
it
barely
five
yet
if
i
was
astonished
with
my
sight
of
the
river
banks
i
was
no
less
astonished
at
my
waterman
now
that
i
had
time
to
look
at
him
and
see
him
with
my
head
and
eyes
clear
he
was
a
handsome
young
fellow
with
a
peculiarly
pleasant
and
friendly
look
about
his
eyes
an
expression
which
was
quite
new
to
me
then
though
i
soon
became
familiar
with
it
for
the
rest
he
was
and
of
skin
and
strong
and
obviously
used
to
exercising
his
muscles
but
with
nothing
rough
or
coarse
about
him
and
clean
as
might
be
his
dress
was
not
like
any
modern
clothes
i
had
seen
but
would
have
served
very
well
as
a
costume
for
a
picture
of
fourteenth
century
life
it
was
of
dark
blue
cloth
simple
enough
but
of
fine
web
and
without
a
stain
on
it
he
had
a
brown
leather
belt
round
his
waist
and
i
noticed
that
its
clasp
was
of
damascened
steel
beautifully
wrought
in
short
he
seemed
to
be
like
some
specially
manly
and
refined
young
gentleman
playing
waterman
for
a
spree
and
i
concluded
that
this
was
the
case
i
felt
that
i
must
make
some
conversation
so
i
pointed
to
the
surrey
bank
where
i
noticed
some
light
plank
stages
running
down
the
foreshore
with
windlasses
at
the
landward
end
of
them
and
said
what
are
they
doing
with
those
things
here
if
we
were
on
the
tay
i
should
have
said
that
they
were
for
drawing
the
salmon
nets
but
here
well
said
he
smiling
of
course
that
is
what
they
for
where
there
are
salmon
there
are
likely
to
be
tay
or
thames
but
of
course
they
are
not
always
in
use
we
do
want
salmon
day
of
the
season
i
was
going
to
say
but
is
this
the
thames
but
held
my
peace
in
my
wonder
and
turned
my
bewildered
eyes
eastward
to
look
at
the
bridge
again
and
thence
to
the
shores
of
the
london
river
and
surely
there
was
enough
to
astonish
me
for
though
there
was
a
bridge
across
the
stream
and
houses
on
its
banks
how
all
was
changed
from
last
night
the
works
with
their
chimneys
were
gone
the
engineer
works
gone
the
gone
and
no
sound
of
rivetting
and
hammering
came
down
the
west
wind
from
thorneycroft
then
the
bridge
i
had
perhaps
dreamed
of
such
a
bridge
but
never
seen
such
an
one
out
of
an
illuminated
manuscript
for
not
even
the
ponte
vecchio
at
florence
came
anywhere
near
it
it
was
of
stone
arches
splendidly
solid
and
as
graceful
as
they
were
strong
high
enough
also
to
let
ordinary
river
traffic
through
easily
over
the
parapet
showed
quaint
and
fanciful
little
buildings
which
i
supposed
to
be
booths
or
shops
beset
with
painted
and
gilded
vanes
and
spirelets
the
stone
was
a
little
weathered
but
showed
no
marks
of
the
grimy
sootiness
which
i
was
used
to
on
every
london
building
more
than
a
year
old
in
short
to
me
a
wonder
of
a
bridge
the
sculler
noted
my
eager
astonished
look
and
said
as
if
in
answer
to
my
thoughts
yes
it
a
pretty
bridge
is
it
even
the
bridges
which
are
so
much
smaller
are
scarcely
daintier
and
the
ones
are
scarcely
more
dignified
and
stately
i
found
myself
saying
almost
against
my
will
how
old
is
it
oh
not
very
old
he
said
it
was
built
or
at
least
opened
in
there
used
to
be
a
rather
plain
timber
bridge
before
then
the
date
shut
my
mouth
as
if
a
key
had
been
turned
in
a
padlock
fixed
to
my
lips
for
i
saw
that
something
inexplicable
had
happened
and
that
if
i
said
much
i
should
be
mixed
up
in
a
game
of
cross
questions
and
crooked
answers
so
i
tried
to
look
unconcerned
and
to
glance
in
a
way
at
the
banks
of
the
river
though
this
is
what
i
saw
up
to
the
bridge
and
a
little
beyond
say
as
far
as
the
site
of
the
works
both
shores
had
a
line
of
very
pretty
houses
low
and
not
large
standing
back
a
little
way
from
the
river
they
were
mostly
built
of
red
brick
and
roofed
with
tiles
and
looked
above
all
comfortable
and
as
if
they
were
so
to
say
alive
and
sympathetic
with
the
life
of
the
dwellers
in
them
there
was
a
continuous
garden
in
front
of
them
going
down
to
the
water
edge
in
which
the
flowers
were
now
blooming
luxuriantly
and
sending
delicious
waves
of
summer
scent
over
the
eddying
stream
behind
the
houses
i
could
see
great
trees
rising
mostly
planes
and
looking
down
the
water
there
were
the
reaches
towards
putney
almost
as
if
they
were
a
lake
with
a
forest
shore
so
thick
were
the
big
trees
and
i
said
aloud
but
as
if
to
myself
well
i
glad
that
they
have
not
built
over
barn
elms
i
blushed
for
my
fatuity
as
the
words
slipped
out
of
my
mouth
and
my
companion
looked
at
me
with
a
half
smile
which
i
thought
i
understood
so
to
hide
my
confusion
i
said
please
take
me
ashore
now
i
want
to
get
my
breakfast
he
nodded
and
brought
her
head
round
with
a
sharp
stroke
and
in
a
trice
we
were
at
the
again
he
jumped
out
and
i
followed
him
and
of
course
i
was
not
surprised
to
see
him
wait
as
if
for
the
inevitable
that
follows
the
doing
of
a
service
to
a
citizen
so
i
put
my
hand
into
my
and
said
how
much
though
still
with
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
perhaps
i
was
offering
money
to
a
gentleman
he
looked
puzzled
and
said
how
much
i
do
quite
understand
what
you
are
asking
about
do
you
mean
the
tide
if
so
it
is
close
on
the
turn
now
i
blushed
and
said
stammering
please
do
take
it
amiss
if
i
ask
you
i
mean
no
offence
but
what
ought
i
to
pay
you
you
see
i
am
a
stranger
and
do
know
your
customs
or
your
coins
and
therewith
i
took
a
handful
of
money
out
of
my
pocket
as
one
does
in
a
foreign
country
and
by
the
way
i
saw
that
the
silver
had
oxydised
and
was
like
a
blackleaded
stove
in
colour
he
still
seemed
puzzled
but
not
at
all
offended
and
he
looked
at
the
coins
with
some
curiosity
i
thought
well
after
all
he
a
waterman
and
is
considering
what
he
may
venture
to
take
he
seems
such
a
nice
fellow
that
i
sure
i
do
grudge
him
a
little
i
wonder
by
the
way
whether
i
could
hire
him
as
a
guide
for
a
day
or
two
since
he
is
so
intelligent
therewith
my
new
friend
said
thoughtfully
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
you
think
that
i
have
done
you
a
service
so
you
feel
yourself
bound
to
give
me
something
which
i
am
not
to
give
to
a
neighbour
unless
he
has
done
something
special
for
me
i
have
heard
of
this
kind
of
thing
but
pardon
me
for
saying
that
it
seems
to
us
a
troublesome
and
roundabout
custom
and
we
do
know
how
to
manage
it
and
you
see
this
ferrying
and
giving
people
casts
about
the
water
is
my
which
i
would
do
for
anybody
so
to
take
gifts
in
connection
with
it
would
look
very
queer
besides
if
one
person
gave
me
something
then
another
might
and
another
and
so
on
and
i
hope
you
wo
think
me
rude
if
i
say
that
i
should
know
where
to
stow
away
so
many
mementos
of
friendship
and
he
laughed
loud
and
merrily
as
if
the
idea
of
being
paid
for
his
work
was
a
very
funny
joke
i
confess
i
began
to
be
afraid
that
the
man
was
mad
though
he
looked
sane
enough
and
i
was
rather
glad
to
think
that
i
was
a
good
swimmer
since
we
were
so
close
to
a
deep
swift
stream
however
he
went
on
by
no
means
like
a
madman
as
to
your
coins
they
are
curious
but
not
very
old
they
seem
to
be
all
of
the
reign
of
victoria
you
might
give
them
to
some
museum
ours
has
enough
of
such
coins
besides
a
fair
number
of
earlier
ones
many
of
which
are
beautiful
whereas
these
nineteenth
century
ones
are
so
beastly
ugly
ai
they
we
have
a
piece
of
edward
with
the
king
in
a
ship
and
little
leopards
and
all
along
the
gunwale
so
delicately
worked
you
see
he
said
with
something
of
a
smirk
i
am
fond
of
working
in
gold
and
fine
metals
this
buckle
here
is
an
early
piece
of
mine
no
doubt
i
looked
a
little
shy
of
him
under
the
influence
of
that
doubt
as
to
his
sanity
so
he
broke
off
short
and
said
in
a
kind
voice
but
i
see
that
i
am
boring
you
and
i
ask
your
pardon
for
not
to
mince
matters
i
can
tell
that
you
a
stranger
and
must
come
from
a
place
very
unlike
england
but
also
it
is
clear
that
it
wo
do
to
overdose
you
with
information
about
this
place
and
that
you
had
best
suck
it
in
little
by
little
further
i
should
take
it
as
very
kind
in
you
if
you
would
allow
me
to
be
the
showman
of
our
new
world
to
you
since
you
have
stumbled
on
me
first
though
indeed
it
will
be
a
mere
kindness
on
your
part
for
almost
anybody
would
make
as
good
a
guide
and
many
much
better
there
certainly
seemed
no
flavour
in
him
of
colney
hatch
and
besides
i
thought
i
could
easily
shake
him
off
if
it
turned
out
that
he
really
was
mad
so
i
said
it
is
a
very
kind
offer
but
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
accept
it
unless
i
was
going
to
say
unless
you
will
let
me
pay
you
properly
but
fearing
to
stir
up
colney
hatch
again
i
changed
the
sentence
into
i
fear
i
shall
be
taking
you
away
from
your
work
or
your
amusement
o
he
said
do
trouble
about
that
because
it
will
give
me
an
opportunity
of
doing
a
good
turn
to
a
friend
of
mine
who
wants
to
take
my
work
here
he
is
a
weaver
from
yorkshire
who
has
rather
overdone
himself
between
his
weaving
and
his
mathematics
both
indoor
work
you
see
and
being
a
great
friend
of
mine
he
naturally
came
to
me
to
get
him
some
outdoor
work
if
you
think
you
can
put
up
with
me
pray
take
me
as
your
guide
he
added
presently
it
is
true
that
i
have
promised
to
go
to
some
special
friends
of
mine
for
the
but
they
wo
be
ready
for
us
for
more
than
a
week
and
besides
you
might
go
with
me
you
know
and
see
some
very
nice
people
besides
making
notes
of
our
ways
in
oxfordshire
you
could
hardly
do
better
if
you
want
to
see
the
country
i
felt
myself
obliged
to
thank
him
whatever
might
come
of
it
and
he
added
eagerly
well
then
that
settled
i
will
give
my
friend
a
call
he
is
living
in
the
guest
house
like
you
and
if
he
is
up
yet
he
ought
to
be
this
fine
summer
morning
therewith
he
took
a
little
silver
from
his
girdle
and
blew
two
or
three
sharp
but
agreeable
notes
on
it
and
presently
from
the
house
which
stood
on
the
site
of
my
old
dwelling
of
which
more
hereafter
another
young
man
came
sauntering
towards
us
he
was
not
so
or
so
strongly
made
as
my
sculler
friend
being
rather
pale
and
not
but
his
face
was
not
wanting
in
that
happy
and
friendly
expression
which
i
had
noticed
in
his
friend
as
he
came
up
smiling
towards
us
i
saw
with
pleasure
that
i
must
give
up
the
colney
hatch
theory
as
to
the
waterman
for
no
two
madmen
ever
behaved
as
they
did
before
a
sane
man
his
dress
also
was
of
the
same
cut
as
the
first
man
though
somewhat
gayer
the
surcoat
being
light
green
with
a
golden
spray
embroidered
on
the
breast
and
his
belt
being
of
filagree
work
he
gave
me
very
civilly
and
greeting
his
friend
joyously
said
well
dick
what
is
it
this
morning
am
i
to
have
my
work
or
rather
your
work
i
dreamed
last
night
that
we
were
off
up
the
river
fishing
all
right
bob
said
my
sculler
you
will
drop
into
my
place
and
if
you
find
it
too
much
there
is
george
brightling
on
the
look
out
for
a
stroke
of
work
and
he
lives
close
handy
to
you
but
see
here
is
a
stranger
who
is
willing
to
amuse
me
by
taking
me
as
his
guide
about
our
and
you
may
imagine
i
do
want
to
lose
the
opportunity
so
you
had
better
take
to
the
boat
at
once
but
in
any
case
i
should
have
kept
you
out
of
it
for
long
since
i
am
due
in
the
fields
in
a
few
days
the
newcomer
rubbed
his
hands
with
glee
but
turning
to
me
said
in
a
friendly
voice
neighbour
both
you
and
friend
dick
are
lucky
and
will
have
a
good
time
as
indeed
i
shall
too
but
you
had
better
both
come
in
with
me
at
once
and
get
something
to
eat
lest
you
should
forget
your
dinner
in
your
amusement
i
suppose
you
came
into
the
guest
house
after
i
had
gone
to
bed
last
night
i
nodded
not
caring
to
enter
into
a
long
explanation
which
would
have
led
to
nothing
and
which
in
truth
by
this
time
i
should
have
begun
to
doubt
myself
and
we
all
three
turned
toward
the
door
of
the
guest
house
chapter
iii
the
guest
house
and
breakfast
therein
i
lingered
a
little
behind
the
others
to
have
a
stare
at
this
house
which
as
i
have
told
you
stood
on
the
site
of
my
old
dwelling
it
was
a
longish
building
with
its
gable
ends
turned
away
from
the
road
and
long
traceried
windows
coming
rather
low
down
set
in
the
wall
that
faced
us
it
was
very
handsomely
built
of
red
brick
with
a
lead
roof
and
high
up
above
the
windows
there
ran
a
frieze
of
figure
subjects
in
baked
clay
very
well
executed
and
designed
with
a
force
and
directness
which
i
had
never
noticed
in
modern
work
before
the
subjects
i
recognised
at
once
and
indeed
was
very
particularly
familiar
with
them
however
all
this
i
took
in
in
a
minute
for
we
were
presently
within
doors
and
standing
in
a
hall
with
a
floor
of
marble
mosaic
and
an
open
timber
roof
there
were
no
windows
on
the
side
opposite
to
the
river
but
arches
below
leading
into
chambers
one
of
which
showed
a
glimpse
of
a
garden
beyond
and
above
them
a
long
space
of
wall
gaily
painted
in
fresco
i
thought
with
similar
subjects
to
those
of
the
frieze
outside
everything
about
the
place
was
handsome
and
generously
solid
as
to
material
and
though
it
was
not
very
large
somewhat
smaller
than
crosby
hall
perhaps
one
felt
in
it
that
exhilarating
sense
of
space
and
freedom
which
satisfactory
architecture
always
gives
to
an
unanxious
man
who
is
in
the
habit
of
using
his
eyes
in
this
pleasant
place
which
of
course
i
knew
to
be
the
hall
of
the
guest
house
three
young
women
were
flitting
to
and
fro
as
they
were
the
first
of
the
sex
i
had
seen
on
this
eventful
morning
i
naturally
looked
at
them
very
attentively
and
found
them
at
least
as
good
as
the
gardens
the
architecture
and
the
male
men
as
to
their
dress
which
of
course
i
took
note
of
i
should
say
that
they
were
decently
veiled
with
drapery
and
not
bundled
up
with
millinery
that
they
were
clothed
like
women
not
upholstered
like
armchairs
as
most
women
of
our
time
are
in
short
their
dress
was
somewhat
between
that
of
the
ancient
classical
costume
and
the
simpler
forms
of
the
fourteenth
century
garments
though
it
was
clearly
not
an
imitation
of
either
the
materials
were
light
and
gay
to
suit
the
season
as
to
the
women
themselves
it
was
pleasant
indeed
to
see
them
they
were
so
kind
and
in
expression
of
face
so
shapely
and
of
body
and
thoroughly
and
strong
all
were
at
least
comely
and
one
of
them
very
handsome
and
regular
of
feature
they
came
up
to
us
at
once
merrily
and
without
the
least
affectation
of
shyness
and
all
three
shook
hands
with
me
as
if
i
were
a
friend
newly
come
back
from
a
long
journey
though
i
could
not
help
noticing
that
they
looked
askance
at
my
garments
for
i
had
on
my
clothes
of
last
night
and
at
the
best
was
never
a
dressy
person
a
word
or
two
from
robert
the
weaver
and
they
bustled
about
on
our
behoof
and
presently
came
and
took
us
by
the
hands
and
led
us
to
a
table
in
the
pleasantest
corner
of
the
hall
where
our
breakfast
was
spread
for
us
and
as
we
sat
down
one
of
them
hurried
out
by
the
chambers
aforesaid
and
came
back
again
in
a
little
while
with
a
great
bunch
of
roses
very
different
in
size
and
quality
to
what
hammersmith
had
been
wont
to
grow
but
very
like
the
produce
of
an
old
country
garden
she
hurried
back
thence
into
the
buttery
and
came
back
once
more
with
a
delicately
made
glass
into
which
she
put
the
flowers
and
set
them
down
in
the
midst
of
our
table
one
of
the
others
who
had
run
off
also
then
came
back
with
a
big
filled
with
strawberries
some
of
them
barely
ripe
and
said
as
she
set
them
on
the
table
there
now
i
thought
of
that
before
i
got
up
this
morning
but
looking
at
the
stranger
here
getting
into
your
boat
dick
put
it
out
of
my
head
so
that
i
was
not
before
the
blackbirds
however
there
are
a
few
about
as
good
as
you
will
get
them
anywhere
in
hammersmith
this
morning
robert
patted
her
on
the
head
in
a
friendly
manner
and
we
fell
to
on
our
breakfast
which
was
simple
enough
but
most
delicately
cooked
and
set
on
the
table
with
much
daintiness
the
bread
was
particularly
good
and
was
of
several
different
kinds
from
the
big
rather
close
farmhouse
loaf
which
was
most
to
my
liking
to
the
thin
of
wheaten
crust
such
as
i
have
eaten
in
turin
as
i
was
putting
the
first
mouthfuls
into
my
mouth
my
eye
caught
a
carved
and
gilded
inscription
on
the
panelling
behind
what
we
should
have
called
the
high
table
in
an
oxford
college
hall
and
a
familiar
name
in
it
forced
me
to
read
it
through
thus
it
ran
and
the
site
of
this
once
stood
the
of
the
hammersmith
a
glass
to
the
it
is
difficult
to
tell
you
how
i
felt
as
i
read
these
words
and
i
suppose
my
face
showed
how
much
i
was
moved
for
both
my
friends
looked
curiously
at
me
and
there
was
silence
between
us
for
a
little
while
presently
the
weaver
who
was
scarcely
so
well
mannered
a
man
as
the
ferryman
said
to
me
rather
awkwardly
guest
we
do
know
what
to
call
you
is
there
any
indiscretion
in
asking
you
your
name
well
said
i
i
have
some
doubts
about
it
myself
so
suppose
you
call
me
guest
which
is
a
family
name
you
know
and
add
william
to
it
if
you
please
dick
nodded
kindly
to
me
but
a
shade
of
anxiousness
passed
over
the
weaver
face
and
he
said
i
hope
you
do
mind
my
asking
but
would
you
tell
me
where
you
come
from
i
am
curious
about
such
things
for
good
reasons
literary
reasons
dick
was
clearly
kicking
him
underneath
the
table
but
he
was
not
much
abashed
and
awaited
my
answer
somewhat
eagerly
as
for
me
i
was
just
going
to
blurt
out
hammersmith
when
i
bethought
me
what
an
entanglement
of
cross
purposes
that
would
lead
us
into
so
i
took
time
to
invent
a
lie
with
circumstance
guarded
by
a
little
truth
and
said
you
see
i
have
been
such
a
long
time
away
from
europe
that
things
seem
strange
to
me
now
but
i
was
born
and
bred
on
the
edge
of
epping
forest
walthamstow
and
woodford
to
wit
a
pretty
place
too
broke
in
dick
a
very
jolly
place
now
that
the
trees
have
had
time
to
grow
again
since
the
great
clearing
of
houses
in
quoth
the
irrepressible
weaver
dear
neighbour
since
you
knew
the
forest
some
time
ago
could
you
tell
me
what
truth
there
is
in
the
rumour
that
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
trees
were
all
pollards
this
was
catching
me
on
my
archaeological
side
and
i
fell
into
the
trap
without
any
thought
of
where
and
when
i
was
so
i
began
on
it
while
one
of
the
girls
the
handsome
one
who
had
been
scattering
little
twigs
of
lavender
and
other
herbs
about
the
floor
came
near
to
listen
and
stood
behind
me
with
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
in
which
she
held
some
of
the
plant
that
i
used
to
call
balm
its
strong
sweet
smell
brought
back
to
my
mind
my
very
early
days
in
the
at
woodford
and
the
large
blue
plums
which
grew
on
the
wall
beyond
the
patch
a
connection
of
memories
which
all
boys
will
see
at
once
i
started
off
when
i
was
a
boy
and
for
long
after
except
for
a
piece
about
queen
elizabeth
lodge
and
for
the
part
about
high
beech
the
forest
was
almost
wholly
made
up
of
pollard
hornbeams
mixed
with
holly
thickets
but
when
the
corporation
of
london
took
it
over
about
five
years
ago
the
topping
and
lopping
which
was
a
part
of
the
old
commoners
rights
came
to
an
end
and
the
trees
were
let
to
grow
but
i
have
not
seen
the
place
now
for
many
years
except
once
when
we
leaguers
went
a
pleasuring
to
high
beech
i
was
very
much
shocked
then
to
see
how
it
was
and
altered
and
the
other
day
we
heard
that
the
philistines
were
going
to
it
but
what
you
were
saying
about
the
building
being
stopped
and
the
trees
growing
is
only
too
good
news
only
you
know
at
that
point
i
suddenly
remembered
dick
date
and
stopped
short
rather
confused
the
eager
weaver
did
notice
my
confusion
but
said
hastily
as
if
he
were
almost
aware
of
his
breach
of
good
manners
but
i
say
how
old
are
you
dick
and
the
pretty
girl
both
burst
out
laughing
as
if
robert
conduct
were
excusable
on
the
grounds
of
eccentricity
and
dick
said
amidst
his
laughter
hold
hard
bob
this
questioning
of
guests
wo
do
why
much
learning
is
spoiling
you
you
remind
me
of
the
radical
cobblers
in
the
silly
old
novels
who
according
to
the
authors
were
prepared
to
trample
down
all
good
manners
in
the
pursuit
of
utilitarian
knowledge
the
fact
is
i
begin
to
think
that
you
have
so
muddled
your
head
with
mathematics
and
with
grubbing
into
those
idiotic
old
books
about
political
economy
he
he
that
you
scarcely
know
how
to
behave
really
it
is
about
time
for
you
to
take
to
some
work
so
that
you
may
clear
away
the
cobwebs
from
your
brain
the
weaver
only
laughed
and
the
girl
went
up
to
him
and
patted
his
cheek
and
said
laughingly
poor
fellow
he
was
born
so
as
for
me
i
was
a
little
puzzled
but
i
laughed
also
partly
for
company
sake
and
partly
with
pleasure
at
their
unanxious
happiness
and
good
temper
and
before
robert
could
make
the
excuse
to
me
which
he
was
getting
ready
i
said
but
neighbours
i
had
caught
up
that
word
i
do
in
the
least
mind
answering
questions
when
i
can
do
so
ask
me
as
many
as
you
please
fun
for
me
i
will
tell
you
all
about
epping
forest
when
i
was
a
boy
if
you
please
and
as
to
my
age
i
not
a
fine
lady
you
know
so
why
should
i
tell
you
i
hard
on
in
spite
of
the
recent
lecture
on
good
manners
the
weaver
could
not
help
giving
a
long
whew
of
astonishment
and
the
others
were
so
amused
by
his
that
the
merriment
flitted
all
over
their
faces
though
for
courtesy
sake
they
forbore
actual
laughter
while
i
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
a
puzzled
manner
and
at
last
said
tell
me
please
what
is
amiss
you
know
i
want
to
learn
from
you
and
please
laugh
only
tell
me
well
they
laugh
and
i
joined
them
again
for
the
reasons
but
at
last
the
pretty
woman
said
coaxingly
well
well
he
rude
poor
fellow
but
you
see
i
may
as
well
tell
you
what
he
is
thinking
about
he
means
that
you
look
rather
old
for
your
age
but
surely
there
need
be
no
wonder
in
that
since
you
have
been
travelling
and
clearly
from
all
you
have
been
saying
in
unsocial
countries
it
has
often
been
said
and
no
doubt
truly
that
one
ages
very
quickly
if
one
lives
amongst
unhappy
people
also
they
say
that
southern
england
is
a
good
place
for
keeping
good
looks
she
blushed
and
said
how
old
am
i
do
you
think
well
quoth
i
i
have
always
been
told
that
a
woman
is
as
old
as
she
looks
so
without
offence
or
flattery
i
should
say
that
you
were
twenty
she
laughed
merrily
and
said
i
am
well
served
out
for
fishing
for
compliments
since
i
have
to
tell
you
the
truth
to
wit
that
i
am
two
i
stared
at
her
and
drew
musical
laughter
from
her
again
but
i
might
well
stare
for
there
was
not
a
careful
line
on
her
face
her
skin
was
as
smooth
as
ivory
her
cheeks
full
and
round
her
lips
as
red
as
the
roses
she
had
brought
in
her
beautiful
arms
which
she
had
bared
for
her
work
firm
and
from
shoulder
to
wrist
she
blushed
a
little
under
my
gaze
though
it
was
clear
that
she
had
taken
me
for
a
man
of
eighty
so
to
pass
it
off
i
said
well
you
see
the
old
saw
is
proved
right
again
and
i
ought
not
to
have
let
you
tempt
me
into
asking
you
a
rude
question
she
laughed
again
and
said
well
lads
old
and
young
i
must
get
to
my
work
now
we
shall
be
rather
busy
here
presently
and
i
want
to
clear
it
off
soon
for
i
began
to
read
a
pretty
old
book
yesterday
and
i
want
to
get
on
with
it
this
morning
so
for
the
present
she
waved
a
hand
to
us
and
stepped
lightly
down
the
hall
taking
as
scott
says
at
least
part
of
the
sun
from
our
table
as
she
went
when
she
was
gone
dick
said
now
guest
wo
you
ask
a
question
or
two
of
our
friend
here
it
is
only
fair
that
you
should
have
your
turn
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
answer
them
said
the
weaver
if
i
ask
you
any
questions
sir
said
i
they
will
not
be
very
severe
but
since
i
hear
that
you
are
a
weaver
i
should
like
to
ask
you
something
about
that
craft
as
i
am
or
was
interested
in
it
oh
said
he
i
shall
not
be
of
much
use
to
you
there
i
afraid
i
only
do
the
most
mechanical
kind
of
weaving
and
am
in
fact
but
a
poor
craftsman
unlike
dick
here
then
besides
the
weaving
i
do
a
little
with
machine
printing
and
composing
though
i
am
little
use
at
the
finer
kinds
of
printing
and
moreover
machine
printing
is
beginning
to
die
out
along
with
the
waning
of
the
plague
of
so
i
have
had
to
turn
to
other
things
that
i
have
a
taste
for
and
have
taken
to
mathematics
and
also
i
am
writing
a
sort
of
antiquarian
book
about
the
peaceable
and
private
history
so
to
say
of
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
more
for
the
sake
of
giving
a
picture
of
the
country
before
the
fighting
began
than
for
anything
else
that
was
why
i
asked
you
those
questions
about
epping
forest
you
have
rather
puzzled
me
i
confess
though
your
information
was
so
interesting
but
later
on
i
hope
we
may
have
some
more
talk
together
when
our
friend
dick
is
here
i
know
he
thinks
me
rather
a
grinder
and
despises
me
for
not
being
very
deft
with
my
hands
that
the
way
nowadays
from
what
i
have
read
of
the
nineteenth
century
literature
and
i
have
read
a
good
deal
it
is
clear
to
me
that
this
is
a
kind
of
revenge
for
the
stupidity
of
that
day
which
despised
everybody
who
use
his
hands
but
dick
old
fellow
quid
overdo
it
come
now
said
dick
am
i
likely
to
am
i
not
the
most
tolerant
man
in
the
world
am
i
not
quite
contented
so
long
as
you
do
make
me
learn
mathematics
or
go
into
your
new
science
of
aesthetics
and
let
me
do
a
little
practical
aesthetics
with
my
gold
and
steel
and
the
blowpipe
and
the
nice
little
hammer
but
hillo
here
comes
another
questioner
for
you
my
poor
guest
i
say
bob
you
must
help
me
to
defend
him
now
here
boffin
he
cried
out
after
a
pause
here
we
are
if
you
must
have
it
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
and
saw
something
flash
and
gleam
in
the
sunlight
that
lay
across
the
hall
so
i
turned
round
and
at
my
ease
saw
a
splendid
figure
slowly
sauntering
over
the
pavement
a
man
whose
surcoat
was
embroidered
most
copiously
as
well
as
elegantly
so
that
the
sun
flashed
back
from
him
as
if
he
had
been
clad
in
golden
armour
the
man
himself
was
tall
and
exceedingly
handsome
and
though
his
face
was
no
less
kindly
in
expression
than
that
of
the
others
he
moved
with
that
somewhat
haughty
mien
which
great
beauty
is
apt
to
give
to
both
men
and
women
he
came
and
sat
down
at
our
table
with
a
smiling
face
stretching
out
his
long
legs
and
hanging
his
arm
over
the
chair
in
the
slowly
graceful
way
which
tall
and
people
may
use
without
affectation
he
was
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
but
looked
as
happy
as
a
child
who
has
just
got
a
new
toy
he
bowed
gracefully
to
me
and
said
i
see
clearly
that
you
are
the
guest
of
whom
annie
has
just
told
me
who
have
come
from
some
distant
country
that
does
not
know
of
us
or
our
ways
of
life
so
i
daresay
you
would
not
mind
answering
me
a
few
questions
for
you
see
here
dick
broke
in
no
please
boffin
let
it
alone
for
the
present
of
course
you
want
the
guest
to
be
happy
and
comfortable
and
how
can
that
be
if
he
has
to
trouble
himself
with
answering
all
sorts
of
questions
while
he
is
still
confused
with
the
new
customs
and
people
about
him
no
no
i
am
going
to
take
him
where
he
can
ask
questions
himself
and
have
them
answered
that
is
to
my
in
bloomsbury
and
i
am
sure
you
ca
have
anything
to
say
against
that
so
instead
of
bothering
you
had
much
better
go
out
to
james
allen
and
get
a
carriage
for
me
as
i
shall
drive
him
up
myself
and
please
tell
jim
to
let
me
have
the
old
grey
for
i
can
drive
a
wherry
much
better
than
a
carriage
jump
up
old
fellow
and
do
be
disappointed
our
guest
will
keep
himself
for
you
and
your
stories
i
stared
at
dick
for
i
wondered
at
his
speaking
to
such
a
personage
so
familiarly
not
to
say
curtly
for
i
thought
that
this
boffin
in
spite
of
his
name
out
of
dickens
must
be
at
the
least
a
senator
of
these
strange
people
however
he
got
up
and
said
all
right
old
whatever
you
like
this
is
not
one
of
my
busy
days
and
though
with
a
condescending
bow
to
me
my
pleasure
of
a
talk
with
this
learned
guest
is
put
off
i
admit
that
he
ought
to
see
your
worthy
kinsman
as
soon
as
possible
besides
perhaps
he
will
be
the
better
able
to
answer
questions
after
his
own
have
been
answered
and
therewith
he
turned
and
swung
himself
out
of
the
hall
when
he
was
well
gone
i
said
is
it
wrong
to
ask
what
boffin
is
whose
name
by
the
way
reminds
me
of
many
pleasant
hours
passed
in
reading
dickens
dick
laughed
yes
yes
said
he
as
it
does
us
i
see
you
take
the
allusion
of
course
his
real
name
is
not
boffin
but
henry
johnson
we
only
call
him
boffin
as
a
joke
partly
because
he
is
a
dustman
and
partly
because
he
will
dress
so
showily
and
get
as
much
gold
on
him
as
a
baron
of
the
middle
ages
as
why
should
he
not
if
he
likes
only
we
are
his
special
friends
you
know
so
of
course
we
jest
with
him
i
held
my
tongue
for
some
time
after
that
but
dick
went
on
he
is
a
capital
fellow
and
you
ca
help
liking
him
but
he
has
a
weakness
he
will
spend
his
time
in
writing
reactionary
novels
and
is
very
proud
of
getting
the
local
colour
right
as
he
calls
it
and
as
he
thinks
you
come
from
some
forgotten
corner
of
the
earth
where
people
are
unhappy
and
consequently
interesting
to
a
he
thinks
he
might
get
some
information
out
of
you
o
he
will
be
quite
straightforward
with
you
for
that
matter
only
for
your
own
comfort
beware
of
him
well
dick
said
the
weaver
doggedly
i
think
his
novels
are
very
good
of
course
you
do
said
dick
birds
of
a
feather
flock
together
mathematics
and
antiquarian
novels
stand
on
much
the
same
footing
but
here
he
comes
again
and
in
effect
the
golden
dustman
hailed
us
from
the
so
we
all
got
up
and
went
into
the
porch
before
which
with
a
strong
grey
horse
in
the
shafts
stood
a
carriage
ready
for
us
which
i
could
not
help
noticing
it
was
light
and
handy
but
had
none
of
that
sickening
vulgarity
which
i
had
known
as
inseparable
from
the
carriages
of
our
time
especially
the
elegant
ones
but
was
as
graceful
and
pleasant
in
line
as
a
wessex
waggon
we
got
in
dick
and
i
the
girls
who
had
come
into
the
porch
to
see
us
off
waved
their
hands
to
us
the
weaver
nodded
kindly
the
dustman
bowed
as
gracefully
as
a
troubadour
dick
shook
the
reins
and
we
were
off
chapter
iv
a
market
by
the
way
we
turned
away
from
the
river
at
once
and
were
soon
in
the
main
road
that
runs
through
hammersmith
but
i
should
have
had
no
guess
as
to
where
i
was
if
i
had
not
started
from
the
waterside
for
king
street
was
gone
and
the
highway
ran
through
wide
sunny
meadows
and
tillage
the
creek
which
we
crossed
at
once
had
been
rescued
from
its
culvert
and
as
we
went
over
its
pretty
bridge
we
saw
its
waters
yet
swollen
by
the
tide
covered
with
gay
boats
of
different
sizes
there
were
houses
about
some
on
the
road
some
amongst
the
fields
with
pleasant
lanes
leading
down
to
them
and
each
surrounded
by
a
teeming
garden
they
were
all
pretty
in
design
and
as
solid
as
might
be
but
countryfied
in
appearance
like
yeomen
dwellings
some
of
them
of
red
brick
like
those
by
the
river
but
more
of
timber
and
plaster
which
were
by
the
necessity
of
their
construction
so
like
mediaeval
houses
of
the
same
materials
that
i
fairly
felt
as
if
i
were
alive
in
the
fourteenth
century
a
sensation
helped
out
by
the
costume
of
the
people
that
we
met
or
passed
in
whose
dress
there
was
nothing
modern
almost
everybody
was
gaily
dressed
but
especially
the
women
who
were
so
or
even
so
handsome
that
i
could
scarcely
refrain
my
tongue
from
calling
my
companion
attention
to
the
fact
some
faces
i
saw
that
were
thoughtful
and
in
these
i
noticed
great
nobility
of
expression
but
none
that
had
a
glimmer
of
unhappiness
and
the
greater
part
we
came
upon
a
good
many
people
were
frankly
and
openly
joyous
i
thought
i
knew
the
broadway
by
the
lie
of
the
roads
that
still
met
there
on
the
north
side
of
the
road
was
a
range
of
buildings
and
courts
low
but
very
handsomely
built
and
ornamented
and
in
that
way
forming
a
great
contrast
to
the
unpretentiousness
of
the
houses
round
about
while
above
this
lower
building
rose
the
steep
roof
and
the
buttresses
and
higher
part
of
the
wall
of
a
great
hall
of
a
splendid
and
exuberant
style
of
architecture
of
which
one
can
say
little
more
than
that
it
seemed
to
me
to
embrace
the
best
qualities
of
the
gothic
of
northern
europe
with
those
of
the
saracenic
and
byzantine
though
there
was
no
copying
of
any
one
of
these
styles
on
the
other
the
south
side
of
the
road
was
an
octagonal
building
with
a
high
roof
not
unlike
the
baptistry
at
florence
in
outline
except
that
it
was
surrounded
by
a
that
clearly
made
an
arcade
or
cloisters
to
it
it
also
was
most
delicately
ornamented
this
whole
mass
of
architecture
which
we
had
come
upon
so
suddenly
from
amidst
the
pleasant
fields
was
not
only
exquisitely
beautiful
in
itself
but
it
bore
upon
it
the
expression
of
such
generosity
and
abundance
of
life
that
i
was
exhilarated
to
a
pitch
that
i
had
never
yet
reached
i
fairly
chuckled
for
pleasure
my
friend
seemed
to
understand
it
and
sat
looking
on
me
with
a
pleased
and
affectionate
interest
we
had
pulled
up
amongst
a
crowd
of
carts
wherein
sat
handsome
people
men
women
and
children
very
gaily
dressed
and
which
were
clearly
market
carts
as
they
were
full
of
very
country
produce
i
said
i
need
not
ask
if
this
is
a
market
for
i
see
clearly
that
it
is
but
what
market
is
it
that
it
is
so
splendid
and
what
is
the
glorious
hall
there
and
what
is
the
building
on
the
south
side
o
said
he
it
is
just
our
hammersmith
market
and
i
am
glad
you
like
it
so
much
for
we
are
really
proud
of
it
of
course
the
hall
inside
is
our
winter
for
in
summer
we
mostly
meet
in
the
fields
down
by
the
river
opposite
barn
elms
the
building
on
our
right
hand
is
our
theatre
i
hope
you
like
it
i
should
be
a
fool
if
i
did
said
i
he
blushed
a
little
as
he
said
i
am
glad
of
that
too
because
i
had
a
hand
in
it
i
made
the
great
doors
which
are
of
damascened
bronze
we
will
look
at
them
later
in
the
day
perhaps
but
we
ought
to
be
getting
on
now
as
to
the
market
this
is
not
one
of
our
busy
days
so
we
shall
do
better
with
it
another
time
because
you
will
see
more
people
i
thanked
him
and
said
are
these
the
regular
country
people
what
very
pretty
girls
there
are
amongst
them
as
i
spoke
my
eye
caught
the
face
of
a
beautiful
woman
tall
and
dressed
in
a
pretty
dress
in
honour
of
the
season
and
the
hot
day
who
smiled
kindly
on
me
and
more
kindly
still
i
thought
on
dick
so
i
stopped
a
minute
but
presently
went
on
i
ask
because
i
do
not
see
any
of
the
people
i
should
have
expected
to
see
at
a
market
i
mean
selling
things
there
i
do
understand
said
he
what
kind
of
people
you
would
expect
to
see
nor
quite
what
you
mean
by
people
these
are
the
neighbours
and
that
like
they
run
in
the
thames
valley
there
are
parts
of
these
islands
which
are
rougher
and
rainier
than
we
are
here
and
there
people
are
rougher
in
their
dress
and
they
themselves
are
tougher
and
more
than
we
are
to
look
at
but
some
people
like
their
looks
better
than
ours
they
say
they
have
more
character
in
them
the
word
well
it
a
matter
of
anyhow
the
cross
between
us
and
them
generally
turns
out
well
added
he
thoughtfully
i
heard
him
though
my
eyes
were
turned
away
from
him
for
that
pretty
girl
was
just
disappearing
through
the
gate
with
her
big
basket
of
early
peas
and
i
felt
that
disappointed
kind
of
feeling
which
overtakes
one
when
one
has
seen
an
interesting
or
lovely
face
in
the
streets
which
one
is
never
likely
to
see
again
and
i
was
silent
a
little
at
last
i
said
what
i
mean
is
that
i
have
seen
any
poor
people
about
not
one
he
knit
his
brows
looked
puzzled
and
said
no
naturally
if
anybody
is
poorly
he
is
likely
to
be
within
doors
or
at
best
crawling
about
the
garden
but
i
do
know
of
any
one
sick
at
present
why
should
you
expect
to
see
poorly
people
on
the
road
no
no
i
said
i
do
mean
sick
people
i
mean
poor
people
you
know
rough
people
no
said
he
smiling
merrily
i
really
do
not
know
the
fact
is
you
must
come
along
quick
to
my
who
will
understand
you
better
than
i
do
come
on
greylocks
therewith
he
shook
the
reins
and
we
jogged
along
merrily
eastward
chapter
v
children
on
the
road
past
the
broadway
there
were
fewer
houses
on
either
side
we
presently
crossed
a
pretty
little
brook
that
ran
across
a
piece
of
land
dotted
over
with
trees
and
awhile
after
came
to
another
market
and
as
we
should
call
it
although
there
was
nothing
familiar
to
me
in
its
surroundings
i
knew
pretty
well
where
we
were
and
was
not
surprised
when
my
guide
said
briefly
kensington
market
just
after
this
we
came
into
a
short
street
of
houses
or
rather
one
long
house
on
either
side
of
the
way
built
of
timber
and
plaster
and
with
a
pretty
arcade
over
the
footway
before
it
quoth
dick
this
is
kensington
proper
people
are
apt
to
gather
here
rather
thick
for
they
like
the
romance
of
the
wood
and
naturalists
haunt
it
too
for
it
is
a
wild
spot
even
here
what
there
is
of
it
for
it
does
not
go
far
to
the
south
it
goes
from
here
northward
and
west
right
over
paddington
and
a
little
way
down
notting
hill
thence
it
runs
to
primrose
hill
and
so
on
rather
a
narrow
strip
of
it
gets
through
kingsland
to
and
clapton
where
it
spreads
out
along
the
heights
above
the
lea
marshes
on
the
other
side
of
which
as
you
know
is
epping
forest
holding
out
a
hand
to
it
this
part
we
are
just
coming
to
is
called
kensington
gardens
though
why
i
know
i
rather
longed
to
say
well
know
but
there
were
so
many
things
about
me
which
i
did
know
in
spite
of
his
assumptions
that
i
thought
it
better
to
hold
my
tongue
the
road
plunged
at
once
into
a
beautiful
wood
spreading
out
on
either
side
but
obviously
much
further
on
the
north
side
where
even
the
oaks
and
sweet
chestnuts
were
of
a
good
growth
while
the
trees
amongst
which
i
thought
the
planes
and
sycamores
too
numerous
were
very
big
and
it
was
exceedingly
pleasant
in
the
dappled
shadow
for
the
day
was
growing
as
hot
as
need
be
and
the
coolness
and
shade
soothed
my
excited
mind
into
a
condition
of
dreamy
pleasure
so
that
i
felt
as
if
i
should
like
to
go
on
for
ever
through
that
balmy
freshness
my
companion
seemed
to
share
in
my
feelings
and
let
the
horse
go
slower
and
slower
as
he
sat
inhaling
the
green
forest
scents
chief
amongst
which
was
the
smell
of
the
trodden
bracken
near
the
wayside
romantic
as
this
kensington
wood
was
however
it
was
not
lonely
we
came
on
many
groups
both
coming
and
going
or
wandering
in
the
edges
of
the
wood
amongst
these
were
many
children
from
six
or
eight
years
old
up
to
sixteen
or
seventeen
they
seemed
to
me
to
be
especially
fine
specimens
of
their
race
and
enjoying
themselves
to
the
utmost
some
of
them
were
hanging
about
little
tents
pitched
on
the
greensward
and
by
some
of
these
fires
were
burning
with
pots
hanging
over
them
gipsy
fashion
dick
explained
to
me
that
there
were
scattered
houses
in
the
forest
and
indeed
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
one
or
two
he
said
they
were
mostly
quite
small
such
as
used
to
be
called
cottages
when
there
were
slaves
in
the
land
but
they
were
pleasant
enough
and
fitting
for
the
wood
they
must
be
pretty
well
stocked
with
children
said
i
pointing
to
the
many
youngsters
about
the
way
o
said
he
these
children
do
not
all
come
from
the
near
houses
the
woodland
houses
but
from
the
generally
they
often
make
up
parties
and
come
to
play
in
the
woods
for
weeks
together
in
living
in
tents
as
you
see
we
rather
encourage
them
to
it
they
learn
to
do
things
for
themselves
and
get
to
notice
the
wild
creatures
and
you
see
the
less
they
stew
inside
houses
the
better
for
them
indeed
i
must
tell
you
that
many
grown
people
will
go
to
live
in
the
forests
through
the
summer
though
they
for
the
most
part
go
to
the
bigger
ones
like
windsor
or
the
forest
of
dean
or
the
northern
wastes
apart
from
the
other
pleasures
of
it
it
gives
them
a
little
rough
work
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
is
getting
somewhat
scarce
for
these
last
fifty
years
he
broke
off
and
then
said
i
tell
you
all
this
because
i
see
that
if
i
talk
i
must
be
answering
questions
which
you
are
thinking
even
if
you
are
not
speaking
them
out
but
my
kinsman
will
tell
you
more
about
it
i
saw
that
i
was
likely
to
get
out
of
my
depth
again
and
so
merely
for
the
sake
of
tiding
over
an
awkwardness
and
to
say
something
i
said
well
the
youngsters
here
will
be
all
the
fresher
for
school
when
the
summer
gets
over
and
they
have
to
go
back
again
school
he
said
yes
what
do
you
mean
by
that
word
i
do
see
how
it
can
have
anything
to
do
with
children
we
talk
indeed
of
a
school
of
herring
and
a
school
of
painting
and
in
the
former
sense
we
might
talk
of
a
school
of
children
but
otherwise
said
he
laughing
i
must
own
myself
beaten
hang
it
thought
i
i
ca
open
my
mouth
without
digging
up
some
new
complexity
i
would
try
to
set
my
friend
right
in
his
etymology
and
i
thought
i
had
best
say
nothing
about
the
which
i
had
been
used
to
call
schools
as
i
saw
pretty
clearly
that
they
had
disappeared
so
i
said
after
a
little
fumbling
i
was
using
the
word
in
the
sense
of
a
system
of
education
education
said
he
meditatively
i
know
enough
latin
to
know
that
the
word
must
come
from
to
lead
out
and
i
have
heard
it
used
but
i
have
never
met
anybody
who
could
give
me
a
clear
explanation
of
what
it
means
you
may
imagine
how
my
new
friends
fell
in
my
esteem
when
i
heard
this
frank
avowal
and
i
said
rather
contemptuously
well
education
means
a
system
of
teaching
young
people
why
not
old
people
also
said
he
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
but
he
went
on
i
can
assure
you
our
children
learn
whether
they
go
through
a
of
teaching
or
not
why
you
will
not
find
one
of
these
children
about
here
boy
or
girl
who
can
not
swim
and
every
one
of
them
has
been
used
to
tumbling
about
the
little
forest
ponies
there
one
of
them
now
they
all
of
them
know
how
to
cook
the
bigger
lads
can
mow
many
can
thatch
and
do
odd
jobs
at
carpentering
or
they
know
how
to
keep
shop
i
can
tell
you
they
know
plenty
of
things
yes
but
their
mental
education
the
teaching
of
their
minds
said
i
kindly
translating
my
phrase
guest
said
he
perhaps
you
have
not
learned
to
do
these
things
i
have
been
speaking
about
and
if
that
the
case
do
you
run
away
with
the
idea
that
it
does
take
some
skill
to
do
them
and
does
give
plenty
of
work
for
one
mind
you
would
change
your
opinion
if
you
saw
a
dorsetshire
lad
thatching
for
instance
but
however
i
understand
you
to
be
speaking
of
and
as
to
that
it
is
a
simple
affair
most
children
seeing
books
lying
about
manage
to
read
by
the
time
they
are
four
years
old
though
i
am
told
it
has
not
always
been
so
as
to
writing
we
do
not
encourage
them
to
scrawl
too
early
though
scrawl
a
little
they
will
because
it
gets
them
into
a
habit
of
ugly
writing
and
what
the
use
of
a
lot
of
ugly
writing
being
done
when
rough
printing
can
be
done
so
easily
you
understand
that
handsome
writing
we
like
and
many
people
will
write
their
books
out
when
they
make
them
or
get
them
written
i
mean
books
of
which
only
a
few
copies
are
needed
poems
and
such
like
you
know
however
i
am
wandering
from
my
lambs
but
you
must
excuse
me
for
i
am
interested
in
this
matter
of
writing
being
myself
a
well
said
i
about
the
children
when
they
know
how
to
read
and
write
do
they
learn
something
else
languages
for
instance
of
course
he
said
sometimes
even
before
they
can
read
they
can
talk
french
which
is
the
nearest
language
talked
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
and
they
soon
get
to
know
german
also
which
is
talked
by
a
huge
number
of
communes
and
colleges
on
the
mainland
these
are
the
principal
languages
we
speak
in
these
islands
along
with
english
or
welsh
or
irish
which
is
another
form
of
welsh
and
children
pick
them
up
very
quickly
because
their
elders
all
know
them
and
besides
our
guests
from
over
sea
often
bring
their
children
with
them
and
the
little
ones
get
together
and
rub
their
speech
into
one
another
and
the
older
languages
said
i
o
yes
said
he
they
mostly
learn
latin
and
greek
along
with
the
modern
ones
when
they
do
anything
more
than
merely
pick
up
the
latter
and
history
said
i
how
do
you
teach
history
well
said
he
when
a
person
can
read
of
course
he
reads
what
he
likes
to
and
he
can
easily
get
someone
to
tell
him
what
are
the
best
books
to
read
on
such
or
such
a
subject
or
to
explain
what
he
understand
in
the
books
when
he
is
reading
them
well
said
i
what
else
do
they
learn
i
suppose
they
do
all
learn
history
no
no
said
he
some
do
care
about
it
in
fact
i
do
think
many
do
i
have
heard
my
say
that
it
is
mostly
in
periods
of
turmoil
and
strife
and
confusion
that
people
care
much
about
history
and
you
know
said
my
friend
with
an
amiable
smile
we
are
not
like
that
now
no
many
people
study
facts
about
the
make
of
things
and
the
matters
of
cause
and
effect
so
that
knowledge
increases
on
us
if
that
be
good
and
some
as
you
heard
about
friend
bob
yonder
will
spend
time
over
mathematics
is
no
use
forcing
people
tastes
said
i
but
you
do
mean
that
children
learn
all
these
things
said
he
that
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
children
and
also
you
must
remember
how
much
they
differ
as
a
rule
they
do
do
much
reading
except
for
a
few
till
they
are
about
fifteen
years
old
we
do
encourage
early
bookishness
though
you
will
find
some
children
who
take
to
books
very
early
which
perhaps
is
not
good
for
them
but
it
no
use
thwarting
them
and
very
often
it
does
last
long
with
them
and
they
find
their
level
before
they
are
twenty
years
old
you
see
children
are
mostly
given
to
imitating
their
elders
and
when
they
see
most
people
about
them
engaged
in
genuinely
amusing
work
like
building
and
and
gardening
and
the
like
that
is
what
they
want
to
be
doing
so
i
do
think
we
need
fear
having
too
many
learned
men
what
could
i
say
i
sat
and
held
my
peace
for
fear
of
fresh
entanglements
besides
i
was
using
my
eyes
with
all
my
might
wondering
as
the
old
horse
jogged
on
when
i
should
come
into
london
proper
and
what
it
would
be
like
now
but
my
companion
could
let
his
subject
quite
drop
and
went
on
meditatively
after
all
i
do
know
that
it
does
them
much
harm
even
if
they
do
grow
up
such
people
as
that
is
a
great
pleasure
seeing
them
so
happy
over
work
which
is
not
much
sought
for
and
besides
these
students
are
generally
such
pleasant
people
so
kind
and
sweet
tempered
so
humble
and
at
the
same
time
so
anxious
to
teach
everybody
all
that
they
know
really
i
like
those
that
i
have
met
prodigiously
this
seemed
to
me
such
very
queer
talk
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
asking
him
another
question
when
just
as
we
came
to
the
top
of
a
rising
ground
down
a
long
glade
of
the
wood
on
my
right
i
caught
sight
of
a
stately
building
whose
outline
was
familiar
to
me
and
i
cried
out
westminster
abbey
yes
said
dick
westminster
abbey
what
there
is
left
of
it
why
what
have
you
done
with
it
quoth
i
in
terror
what
have
done
with
it
said
he
nothing
much
save
clean
it
but
you
know
the
whole
outside
was
spoiled
centuries
ago
as
to
the
inside
that
remains
in
its
beauty
after
the
great
clearance
which
took
place
over
a
hundred
years
ago
of
the
beastly
monuments
to
fools
and
knaves
which
once
blocked
it
up
as
says
we
went
on
a
little
further
and
i
looked
to
the
right
again
and
said
in
rather
a
doubtful
tone
of
voice
why
there
are
the
houses
of
parliament
do
you
still
use
them
he
burst
out
laughing
and
was
some
time
before
he
could
control
himself
then
he
clapped
me
on
the
back
and
said
i
take
you
neighbour
you
may
well
wonder
at
our
keeping
them
standing
and
i
know
something
about
that
and
my
old
kinsman
has
given
me
books
to
read
about
the
strange
game
that
they
played
there
use
them
well
yes
they
are
used
for
a
sort
of
subsidiary
market
and
a
storage
place
for
manure
and
they
are
handy
for
that
being
on
the
waterside
i
believe
it
was
intended
to
pull
them
down
quite
at
the
beginning
of
our
days
but
there
was
i
am
told
a
queer
antiquarian
society
which
had
done
some
service
in
past
times
and
which
straightway
set
up
its
pipe
against
their
destruction
as
it
has
done
with
many
other
buildings
which
most
people
looked
upon
as
worthless
and
public
nuisances
and
it
was
so
energetic
and
had
such
good
reasons
to
give
that
it
generally
gained
its
point
and
i
must
say
that
when
all
is
said
i
am
glad
of
it
because
you
know
at
the
worst
these
silly
old
buildings
serve
as
a
kind
of
foil
to
the
beautiful
ones
which
we
build
now
you
will
see
several
others
in
these
parts
the
place
my
lives
in
for
instance
and
a
big
building
called
paul
and
you
see
in
this
matter
we
need
not
grudge
a
few
poorish
buildings
standing
because
we
can
always
build
elsewhere
nor
need
we
be
anxious
as
to
the
breeding
of
pleasant
work
in
such
matters
for
there
is
always
room
for
more
and
more
work
in
a
new
building
even
without
making
it
pretentious
for
instance
doors
is
to
me
so
delightful
that
if
i
were
driven
to
it
i
would
most
sacrifice
outdoor
space
to
it
then
of
course
there
is
the
ornament
which
as
we
must
all
allow
may
easily
be
overdone
in
mere
living
houses
but
can
hardly
be
in
and
markets
and
so
forth
i
must
tell
you
though
that
my
sometimes
tells
me
i
am
a
little
cracked
on
this
subject
of
fine
building
and
indeed
i
think
that
the
energies
of
mankind
are
chiefly
of
use
to
them
for
such
work
for
in
that
direction
i
can
see
no
end
to
the
work
while
in
many
others
a
limit
does
seem
possible
chapter
vi
a
little
shopping
as
he
spoke
we
came
suddenly
out
of
the
woodland
into
a
short
street
of
handsomely
built
houses
which
my
companion
named
to
me
at
once
as
piccadilly
the
lower
part
of
these
i
should
have
called
shops
if
it
had
not
been
that
as
far
as
i
could
see
the
people
were
ignorant
of
the
arts
of
buying
and
selling
wares
were
displayed
in
their
finely
designed
fronts
as
if
to
tempt
people
in
and
people
stood
and
looked
at
them
or
went
in
and
came
out
with
parcels
under
their
arms
just
like
the
real
thing
on
each
side
of
the
street
ran
an
elegant
arcade
to
protect
as
in
some
of
the
old
italian
cities
about
halfway
down
a
huge
building
of
the
kind
i
was
now
prepared
to
expect
told
me
that
this
also
was
a
centre
of
some
kind
and
had
its
special
public
buildings
said
dick
here
you
see
is
another
market
on
a
different
plan
from
most
others
the
upper
stories
of
these
houses
are
used
for
for
people
from
all
about
the
country
are
apt
to
drift
up
hither
from
time
to
time
as
folk
are
very
thick
upon
the
ground
which
you
will
see
evidence
of
presently
and
there
are
people
who
are
fond
of
crowds
though
i
ca
say
that
i
am
i
could
help
smiling
to
see
how
long
a
tradition
would
last
here
was
the
ghost
of
london
still
asserting
itself
as
a
centre
an
intellectual
centre
for
aught
i
knew
however
i
said
nothing
except
that
i
asked
him
to
drive
very
slowly
as
the
things
in
the
booths
looked
exceedingly
pretty
yes
said
he
this
is
a
very
good
market
for
pretty
things
and
is
mostly
kept
for
the
handsomer
goods
as
the
market
where
they
set
out
cabbages
and
turnips
and
such
like
things
along
with
beer
and
the
rougher
kind
of
wine
is
so
near
then
he
looked
at
me
curiously
and
said
perhaps
you
would
like
to
do
a
little
shopping
as
is
called
i
looked
at
what
i
could
see
of
my
rough
blue
duds
which
i
had
plenty
of
opportunity
of
contrasting
with
the
gay
attire
of
the
citizens
we
had
come
across
and
i
thought
that
if
as
seemed
likely
i
should
presently
be
shown
about
as
a
curiosity
for
the
amusement
of
this
most
unbusinesslike
people
i
should
like
to
look
a
little
less
like
a
discharged
ship
purser
but
in
spite
of
all
that
had
happened
my
hand
went
down
into
my
pocket
again
where
to
my
dismay
it
met
nothing
metallic
except
two
rusty
old
keys
and
i
remembered
that
amidst
our
talk
in
the
at
hammersmith
i
had
taken
the
cash
out
of
my
pocket
to
show
to
the
pretty
annie
and
had
left
it
lying
there
my
face
fell
fifty
per
and
dick
beholding
me
said
rather
sharply
hilloa
guest
what
the
matter
now
is
it
a
wasp
no
said
i
but
i
left
it
behind
well
said
he
whatever
you
have
left
behind
you
can
get
in
this
market
again
so
do
trouble
yourself
about
it
i
had
come
to
my
senses
by
this
time
and
remembering
the
astounding
customs
of
this
country
had
no
mind
for
another
lecture
on
social
economy
and
the
edwardian
coinage
so
i
said
only
my
clothes
could
i
you
see
what
do
think
could
be
done
about
them
he
did
seem
in
the
least
inclined
to
laugh
but
said
quite
gravely
o
do
get
new
clothes
yet
you
see
my
is
an
antiquarian
and
he
will
want
to
see
you
just
as
you
are
and
you
know
i
must
preach
to
you
but
surely
it
would
be
right
for
you
to
take
away
people
pleasure
of
studying
your
attire
by
just
going
and
making
yourself
like
everybody
else
you
feel
that
do
you
said
he
earnestly
i
did
feel
it
my
duty
to
set
myself
up
for
a
scarecrow
amidst
this
people
but
i
saw
i
had
got
across
some
ineradicable
prejudice
and
that
it
would
do
to
quarrel
with
my
new
friend
so
i
merely
said
o
certainly
certainly
well
said
he
pleasantly
you
may
as
well
see
what
the
inside
of
these
booths
is
like
think
of
something
you
want
said
i
could
i
get
some
tobacco
and
a
pipe
of
course
said
he
what
was
i
thinking
of
not
asking
you
before
well
bob
is
always
telling
me
that
we
are
a
selfish
lot
and
i
afraid
he
is
right
but
come
along
here
is
a
place
just
handy
therewith
he
drew
rein
and
jumped
down
and
i
followed
a
very
handsome
woman
splendidly
clad
in
figured
silk
was
slowly
passing
by
looking
into
the
windows
as
she
went
to
her
quoth
dick
maiden
would
you
kindly
hold
our
horse
while
we
go
in
for
a
little
she
nodded
to
us
with
a
kind
smile
and
fell
to
patting
the
horse
with
her
pretty
hand
what
a
beautiful
creature
said
i
to
dick
as
we
entered
what
old
greylocks
said
he
with
a
sly
grin
no
no
said
i
goldylocks
the
lady
well
so
she
is
said
he
is
a
good
job
there
are
so
many
of
them
that
every
jack
may
have
his
jill
else
i
fear
that
we
should
get
fighting
for
them
indeed
said
he
becoming
very
grave
i
do
say
that
it
does
not
happen
even
now
sometimes
for
you
know
love
is
not
a
very
reasonable
thing
and
perversity
and
are
commoner
than
some
of
our
moralists
think
he
added
in
a
still
more
sombre
tone
yes
only
a
month
ago
there
was
a
mishap
down
by
us
that
in
the
end
cost
the
lives
of
two
men
and
a
woman
and
as
it
were
put
out
the
sunlight
for
us
for
a
while
do
ask
me
about
it
just
now
i
may
tell
you
about
it
later
on
by
this
time
we
were
within
the
shop
or
booth
which
had
a
counter
and
shelves
on
the
walls
all
very
neat
though
without
any
pretence
of
showiness
but
otherwise
not
very
different
to
what
i
had
been
used
to
within
were
a
couple
of
children
a
boy
of
about
twelve
who
sat
reading
a
book
and
a
pretty
little
girl
of
about
a
year
older
who
was
sitting
also
reading
behind
the
counter
they
were
obviously
brother
and
sister
good
morning
little
neighbours
said
dick
my
friend
here
wants
tobacco
and
a
pipe
can
you
help
him
o
yes
certainly
said
the
girl
with
a
sort
of
demure
alertness
which
was
somewhat
amusing
the
boy
looked
up
and
fell
to
staring
at
my
outlandish
attire
but
presently
reddened
and
turned
his
head
as
if
he
knew
that
he
was
not
behaving
prettily
dear
neighbour
said
the
girl
with
the
most
solemn
countenance
of
a
child
playing
at
keeping
shop
what
tobacco
is
it
you
would
like
latakia
quoth
i
feeling
as
if
i
were
assisting
at
a
child
game
and
wondering
whether
i
should
get
anything
but
but
the
girl
took
a
dainty
little
basket
from
a
shelf
beside
her
went
to
a
jar
and
took
out
a
lot
of
tobacco
and
put
the
filled
basket
down
on
the
counter
before
me
where
i
could
both
smell
and
see
that
it
was
excellent
latakia
but
you
have
weighed
it
said
i
and
and
how
much
am
i
to
take
why
she
said
i
advise
you
to
cram
your
bag
because
you
may
be
going
where
you
ca
get
latakia
where
is
your
bag
i
fumbled
about
and
at
last
pulled
out
my
piece
of
cotton
print
which
does
duty
with
me
for
a
tobacco
pouch
but
the
girl
looked
at
it
with
some
disdain
and
said
dear
neighbour
i
can
give
you
something
much
better
than
that
cotton
rag
and
she
tripped
up
the
shop
and
came
back
presently
and
as
she
passed
the
boy
whispered
something
in
his
ear
and
he
nodded
and
got
up
and
went
out
the
girl
held
up
in
her
finger
and
thumb
a
red
morocco
bag
gaily
embroidered
and
said
there
i
have
chosen
one
for
you
and
you
are
to
have
it
it
is
pretty
and
will
hold
a
lot
therewith
she
fell
to
cramming
it
with
the
tobacco
and
laid
it
down
by
me
and
said
now
for
the
pipe
that
also
you
must
let
me
choose
for
you
there
are
three
pretty
ones
just
come
in
she
disappeared
again
and
came
back
with
a
pipe
in
her
hand
carved
out
of
some
hard
wood
very
elaborately
and
mounted
in
gold
sprinkled
with
little
gems
it
was
in
short
as
pretty
and
gay
a
toy
as
i
had
ever
seen
something
like
the
best
kind
of
japanese
work
but
better
dear
me
said
i
when
i
set
eyes
on
it
this
is
altogether
too
grand
for
me
or
for
anybody
but
the
emperor
of
the
world
besides
i
shall
lose
it
i
always
lose
my
pipes
the
child
seemed
rather
dashed
and
said
do
you
like
it
neighbour
o
yes
i
said
of
course
i
like
it
well
then
take
it
said
she
and
do
trouble
about
losing
it
what
will
it
matter
if
you
do
somebody
is
sure
to
find
it
and
he
will
use
it
and
you
can
get
another
i
took
it
out
of
her
hand
to
look
at
it
and
while
i
did
so
forgot
my
caution
and
said
but
however
am
i
to
pay
for
such
a
thing
as
this
dick
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
as
i
spoke
and
turning
i
met
his
eyes
with
a
comical
expression
in
them
which
warned
me
against
another
exhibition
of
extinct
commercial
morality
so
i
reddened
and
held
my
tongue
while
the
girl
simply
looked
at
me
with
the
deepest
gravity
as
if
i
were
a
foreigner
blundering
in
my
speech
for
she
clearly
understand
me
a
bit
thank
you
so
very
much
i
said
at
last
effusively
as
i
put
the
pipe
in
my
pocket
not
without
a
qualm
of
doubt
as
to
whether
i
should
find
myself
before
a
magistrate
presently
o
you
are
so
very
welcome
said
the
little
lass
with
an
affectation
of
manners
at
their
best
which
was
very
quaint
it
is
such
a
pleasure
to
serve
dear
old
gentlemen
like
you
especially
when
one
can
see
at
once
that
you
have
come
from
far
over
sea
yes
my
dear
quoth
i
i
have
been
a
great
traveller
as
i
told
this
lie
from
pure
politeness
in
came
the
lad
again
with
a
tray
in
his
hands
on
which
i
saw
a
long
flask
and
two
beautiful
glasses
neighbours
said
the
girl
who
did
all
the
talking
her
brother
being
very
shy
clearly
please
to
drink
a
glass
to
us
before
you
go
since
we
do
not
have
guests
like
this
every
day
therewith
the
boy
put
the
tray
on
the
counter
and
solemnly
poured
out
a
wine
into
the
long
bowls
nothing
loth
i
drank
for
i
was
thirsty
with
the
hot
day
and
thinks
i
i
am
yet
in
the
world
and
the
grapes
of
the
rhine
have
not
yet
lost
their
flavour
for
if
ever
i
drank
good
steinberg
i
drank
it
that
morning
and
i
made
a
mental
note
to
ask
dick
how
they
managed
to
make
fine
wine
when
there
were
no
longer
labourers
compelled
to
drink
instead
of
the
fine
wine
which
they
themselves
made
do
you
drink
a
glass
to
us
dear
little
neighbours
said
i
i
do
drink
wine
said
the
lass
i
like
lemonade
better
but
i
wish
your
health
and
i
like
better
said
the
little
lad
well
well
thought
i
neither
have
children
tastes
changed
much
and
therewith
we
gave
them
good
day
and
went
out
of
the
booth
to
my
disappointment
like
a
change
in
a
dream
a
tall
old
man
was
holding
our
horse
instead
of
the
beautiful
woman
he
explained
to
us
that
the
maiden
could
not
wait
and
that
he
had
taken
her
place
and
he
winked
at
us
and
laughed
when
he
saw
how
our
faces
fell
so
that
we
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
laugh
also
where
are
you
going
said
he
to
dick
to
bloomsbury
said
dick
if
you
two
do
want
to
be
alone
i
come
with
you
said
the
old
man
all
right
said
dick
tell
me
when
you
want
to
get
down
and
i
stop
for
you
let
get
on
so
we
got
under
way
again
and
i
asked
if
children
generally
waited
on
people
in
the
markets
often
enough
said
he
when
it
is
a
matter
of
dealing
with
heavy
weights
but
by
no
means
always
the
children
like
to
amuse
themselves
with
it
and
it
is
good
for
them
because
they
handle
a
lot
of
diverse
wares
and
get
to
learn
about
them
how
they
are
made
and
where
they
come
from
and
so
on
besides
it
is
such
very
easy
work
that
anybody
can
do
it
it
is
said
that
in
the
early
days
of
our
epoch
there
were
a
good
many
people
who
were
hereditarily
afflicted
with
a
disease
called
idleness
because
they
were
the
direct
descendants
of
those
who
in
the
bad
times
used
to
force
other
people
to
work
for
them
the
people
you
know
who
are
called
or
employers
of
labour
in
the
history
books
well
these
people
used
to
serve
booths
their
time
because
they
were
fit
for
so
little
indeed
i
believe
that
at
one
time
they
were
actually
to
do
some
such
work
because
they
especially
the
women
got
so
ugly
and
produced
such
ugly
children
if
their
disease
was
not
treated
sharply
that
the
neighbours
could
stand
it
however
i
happy
to
say
that
all
that
is
gone
by
now
the
disease
is
either
extinct
or
exists
in
such
a
mild
form
that
a
short
course
of
aperient
medicine
carries
it
off
it
is
sometimes
called
the
now
or
the
mulleygrubs
queer
names
ai
they
yes
said
i
pondering
much
but
the
old
man
broke
in
yes
all
that
is
true
neighbour
and
i
have
seen
some
of
those
poor
women
grown
old
but
my
father
used
to
know
some
of
them
when
they
were
young
and
he
said
that
they
were
as
little
like
young
women
as
might
be
they
had
hands
like
bunches
of
skewers
and
wretched
little
arms
like
sticks
and
waists
like
and
thin
lips
and
peaked
noses
and
pale
cheeks
and
they
were
always
pretending
to
be
offended
at
anything
you
said
or
did
to
them
no
wonder
they
bore
ugly
children
for
no
one
except
men
like
them
could
be
in
love
with
them
poor
things
he
stopped
and
seemed
to
be
musing
on
his
past
life
and
then
said
and
do
you
know
neighbours
that
once
on
a
time
people
were
still
anxious
about
that
disease
of
idleness
at
one
time
we
gave
ourselves
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
trying
to
cure
people
of
it
have
you
not
read
any
of
the
medical
books
on
the
subject
no
said
i
for
the
old
man
was
speaking
to
me
well
said
he
it
was
thought
at
the
time
that
it
was
the
survival
of
the
old
mediaeval
disease
of
leprosy
it
seems
it
was
very
catching
for
many
of
the
people
afflicted
by
it
were
much
secluded
and
were
waited
upon
by
a
special
class
of
diseased
persons
queerly
dressed
up
so
that
they
might
be
known
they
wore
amongst
other
garments
breeches
made
of
worsted
velvet
that
stuff
which
used
to
be
called
plush
some
years
ago
all
this
seemed
very
interesting
to
me
and
i
should
like
to
have
made
the
old
man
talk
more
but
dick
got
rather
restive
under
so
much
ancient
history
besides
i
suspect
he
wanted
to
keep
me
as
fresh
as
he
could
for
his
so
he
burst
out
laughing
at
last
and
said
excuse
me
neighbours
but
i
ca
help
it
fancy
people
not
liking
to
work
it
too
ridiculous
why
even
you
like
to
work
old
fellow
sometimes
said
he
affectionately
patting
the
old
horse
with
the
whip
what
a
queer
disease
it
may
well
be
called
mulleygrubs
and
he
laughed
out
again
most
boisterously
rather
too
much
so
i
thought
for
his
usual
good
manners
and
i
laughed
with
him
for
sake
but
from
the
teeth
outward
only
for
saw
nothing
funny
in
people
not
liking
to
work
as
you
may
well
imagine
chapter
vii
trafalgar
square
and
now
again
i
was
busy
looking
about
me
for
we
were
quite
clear
of
piccadilly
market
and
were
in
a
region
of
much
ornamented
houses
which
i
should
have
called
villas
if
they
had
been
ugly
and
pretentious
which
was
very
far
from
being
the
case
each
house
stood
in
a
garden
carefully
cultivated
and
running
over
with
flowers
the
blackbirds
were
singing
their
best
amidst
the
which
except
for
a
bay
here
and
there
and
occasional
groups
of
limes
seemed
to
be
all
there
were
a
great
many
now
all
laden
with
fruit
and
several
times
as
we
passed
by
a
garden
we
were
offered
baskets
of
fine
fruit
by
children
and
young
girls
amidst
all
these
gardens
and
houses
it
was
of
course
impossible
to
trace
the
sites
of
the
old
streets
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
main
roadways
were
the
same
as
of
old
we
came
presently
into
a
large
open
space
sloping
somewhat
toward
the
south
the
sunny
site
of
which
had
been
taken
advantage
of
for
planting
an
orchard
mainly
as
i
could
see
of
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
pretty
gay
little
structure
of
wood
painted
and
gilded
that
looked
like
a
from
the
southern
side
of
the
said
orchard
ran
a
long
road
chequered
over
with
the
shadow
of
tall
old
pear
trees
at
the
end
of
which
showed
the
high
tower
of
the
parliament
house
or
dung
market
a
strange
sensation
came
over
me
i
shut
my
eyes
to
keep
out
the
sight
of
the
sun
glittering
on
this
fair
abode
of
gardens
and
for
a
moment
there
passed
before
them
a
phantasmagoria
of
another
day
a
great
space
surrounded
by
tall
ugly
houses
with
an
ugly
church
at
the
corner
and
a
nondescript
ugly
cupolaed
building
at
my
back
the
roadway
thronged
with
a
sweltering
and
excited
crowd
dominated
by
omnibuses
crowded
with
spectators
in
the
midst
a
paved
square
populated
only
by
a
few
men
dressed
in
blue
and
a
good
many
singularly
ugly
bronze
images
one
on
the
top
of
a
tall
column
the
said
square
guarded
up
to
the
edge
of
the
roadway
by
a
line
of
big
men
clad
in
blue
and
across
the
southern
roadway
the
helmets
of
a
band
of
dead
white
in
the
greyness
of
the
chilly
november
afternoon
i
opened
my
eyes
to
the
sunlight
again
and
looked
round
me
and
cried
out
among
the
whispering
trees
and
odorous
blossoms
trafalgar
square
yes
said
dick
who
had
drawn
rein
again
so
it
is
i
do
wonder
at
your
finding
the
name
ridiculous
but
after
all
it
was
nobody
business
to
alter
it
since
the
name
of
a
dead
folly
does
bite
yet
sometimes
i
think
we
might
have
given
it
a
name
which
would
have
commemorated
the
great
battle
which
was
fought
on
the
spot
itself
in
that
was
important
enough
if
the
historians
do
lie
which
they
generally
do
or
at
least
did
said
the
old
man
for
instance
what
can
you
make
of
this
neighbours
i
have
read
a
muddled
account
in
a
book
o
a
stupid
book
called
james
social
democratic
history
of
a
fight
which
took
place
here
in
or
about
the
year
i
am
bad
at
dates
some
people
says
this
story
were
going
to
hold
a
mote
here
or
some
such
thing
and
the
government
of
london
or
the
council
or
the
commission
or
what
not
other
barbarous
body
of
fools
fell
upon
these
citizens
as
they
were
then
called
with
the
armed
hand
that
seems
too
ridiculous
to
be
true
but
according
to
this
version
of
the
story
nothing
much
came
of
it
which
certainly
too
ridiculous
to
be
true
well
quoth
i
but
after
all
your
james
is
right
so
far
and
it
true
except
that
there
was
no
fighting
merely
unarmed
and
peaceable
people
attacked
by
ruffians
armed
with
bludgeons
and
they
put
up
with
that
said
dick
with
the
first
unpleasant
expression
i
had
seen
on
his
face
said
i
reddening
we
to
put
up
with
it
we
could
help
it
the
old
man
looked
at
me
keenly
and
said
you
seem
to
know
a
great
deal
about
it
neighbour
and
is
it
really
true
that
nothing
came
of
it
this
came
of
it
said
i
that
a
good
many
people
were
sent
to
prison
because
of
it
what
of
the
bludgeoners
said
the
old
man
poor
devils
no
no
said
i
of
the
bludgeoned
said
the
old
man
rather
severely
friend
i
expect
that
you
have
been
reading
some
rotten
collection
of
lies
and
have
been
taken
in
by
it
too
easily
i
assure
you
said
i
what
i
have
been
saying
is
true
well
well
i
am
sure
you
think
so
neighbour
said
the
old
man
but
i
do
see
why
you
should
be
so
cocksure
as
i
could
explain
why
i
held
my
tongue
meanwhile
dick
who
had
been
sitting
with
knit
brows
cogitating
spoke
at
last
and
said
gently
and
rather
sadly
how
strange
to
think
that
there
have
been
men
like
ourselves
and
living
in
this
beautiful
and
happy
country
who
i
suppose
had
feelings
and
affections
like
ourselves
who
could
yet
do
such
dreadful
things
yes
said
i
in
a
didactic
tone
yet
after
all
even
those
days
were
a
great
improvement
on
the
days
that
had
gone
before
them
have
you
not
read
of
the
mediaeval
period
and
the
ferocity
of
its
criminal
laws
and
how
in
those
days
men
fairly
seemed
to
have
enjoyed
tormenting
their
fellow
men
nay
for
the
matter
of
that
they
made
their
god
a
tormentor
and
a
jailer
rather
than
anything
else
yes
said
dick
there
are
good
books
on
that
period
also
some
of
which
i
have
read
but
as
to
the
great
improvement
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
do
see
it
after
all
the
mediaeval
folk
acted
after
their
conscience
as
your
remark
about
their
god
which
is
true
shows
and
they
were
ready
to
bear
what
they
inflicted
on
others
whereas
the
nineteenth
century
ones
were
hypocrites
and
pretended
to
be
humane
and
yet
went
on
tormenting
those
whom
they
dared
to
treat
so
by
shutting
them
up
in
prison
for
no
reason
at
all
except
that
they
were
what
they
themselves
the
had
forced
them
to
be
o
it
horrible
to
think
of
but
perhaps
said
i
they
did
not
know
what
the
prisons
were
like
dick
seemed
roused
and
even
angry
more
shame
for
them
said
he
when
you
and
i
know
it
all
these
years
afterwards
look
you
neighbour
they
could
fail
to
know
what
a
disgrace
a
prison
is
to
the
commonwealth
at
the
best
and
that
their
prisons
were
a
good
step
on
towards
being
at
the
worst
quoth
i
but
have
you
no
prisons
at
all
now
as
soon
as
the
words
were
out
of
my
mouth
i
felt
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
for
dick
flushed
red
and
frowned
and
the
old
man
looked
surprised
and
pained
and
presently
dick
said
angrily
yet
as
if
restraining
himself
somewhat
man
alive
how
can
you
ask
such
a
question
have
i
not
told
you
that
we
know
what
a
prison
means
by
the
undoubted
evidence
of
really
trustworthy
books
helped
out
by
our
own
imaginations
and
have
you
specially
called
me
to
notice
that
the
people
about
the
roads
and
streets
look
happy
and
how
could
they
look
happy
if
they
knew
that
their
neighbours
were
shut
up
in
prison
while
they
bore
such
things
quietly
and
if
there
were
people
in
prison
you
could
hide
it
from
folk
like
you
may
an
occasional
because
that
is
done
of
set
purpose
with
a
lot
of
people
backing
up
the
slayer
in
cold
blood
as
this
prison
business
is
prisons
indeed
o
no
no
no
he
stopped
and
began
to
cool
down
and
said
in
a
kind
voice
but
forgive
me
i
need
be
so
hot
about
it
since
there
are
any
prisons
i
afraid
you
will
think
the
worse
of
me
for
losing
my
temper
of
course
you
coming
from
the
outlands
can
not
be
expected
to
know
about
these
things
and
now
i
afraid
i
have
made
you
feel
uncomfortable
in
a
way
he
had
but
he
was
so
generous
in
his
heat
that
i
liked
him
the
better
for
it
and
i
said
no
really
is
all
my
fault
for
being
so
stupid
let
me
change
the
subject
and
ask
you
what
the
stately
building
is
on
our
left
just
showing
at
the
end
of
that
grove
of
ah
he
said
that
is
an
old
building
built
before
the
middle
of
the
twentieth
century
and
as
you
see
in
a
queer
fantastic
style
not
over
beautiful
but
there
are
some
fine
things
inside
it
too
mostly
pictures
some
very
old
it
is
called
the
national
gallery
i
have
sometimes
puzzled
as
to
what
the
name
means
anyhow
nowadays
wherever
there
is
a
place
where
pictures
are
kept
as
curiosities
permanently
it
is
called
a
national
gallery
perhaps
after
this
one
of
course
there
are
a
good
many
of
them
up
and
down
the
country
i
did
try
to
enlighten
him
feeling
the
task
too
heavy
but
i
pulled
out
my
magnificent
pipe
and
fell
and
the
old
horse
jogged
on
again
as
we
went
i
said
this
pipe
is
a
very
elaborate
toy
and
you
seem
so
reasonable
in
this
country
and
your
architecture
is
so
good
that
i
rather
wonder
at
your
turning
out
such
trivialities
it
struck
me
as
i
spoke
that
this
was
rather
ungrateful
of
me
after
having
received
such
a
fine
present
but
dick
did
seem
to
notice
my
bad
manners
but
said
well
i
do
know
it
is
a
pretty
thing
and
since
nobody
need
make
such
things
unless
they
like
i
do
see
why
they
should
make
them
if
they
like
of
course
if
carvers
were
scarce
they
would
all
be
busy
on
the
architecture
as
you
call
it
and
then
these
a
good
word
would
not
be
made
but
since
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
can
carve
in
fact
almost
everybody
and
as
work
is
somewhat
scarce
or
we
are
afraid
it
may
be
folk
do
not
discourage
this
kind
of
petty
work
he
mused
a
little
and
seemed
somewhat
perturbed
but
presently
his
face
cleared
and
he
said
after
all
you
must
admit
that
the
pipe
is
a
very
pretty
thing
with
the
little
people
under
the
trees
all
cut
so
clean
and
sweet
too
elaborate
for
a
pipe
perhaps
but
well
it
is
very
pretty
too
valuable
for
its
use
perhaps
said
i
what
that
said
he
i
do
understand
i
was
just
going
in
a
helpless
way
to
try
to
make
him
understand
when
we
came
by
the
gates
of
a
big
rambling
building
in
which
work
of
some
sort
seemed
going
on
what
building
is
that
said
i
eagerly
for
it
was
a
pleasure
amidst
all
these
strange
things
to
see
something
a
little
like
what
i
was
used
to
it
seems
to
be
a
factory
yes
he
said
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
and
that
what
it
is
but
we
do
call
them
factories
now
but
that
is
places
where
people
collect
who
want
to
work
together
i
suppose
said
i
power
of
some
sort
is
used
there
no
no
said
he
why
should
people
collect
together
to
use
power
when
they
can
have
it
at
the
places
where
they
live
or
hard
by
any
two
or
three
of
them
or
any
one
for
the
matter
of
that
no
folk
collect
in
these
to
do
in
which
working
together
is
necessary
or
convenient
such
work
is
often
very
pleasant
in
there
for
instance
they
make
pottery
and
glass
there
you
can
see
the
tops
of
the
furnaces
well
of
course
it
handy
to
have
ovens
and
kilns
and
and
a
good
lot
of
things
to
use
them
for
though
of
course
there
are
a
good
many
such
places
as
it
would
be
ridiculous
if
a
man
had
a
liking
for
or
that
he
should
have
to
live
in
one
place
or
be
obliged
to
forego
the
work
he
liked
i
see
no
smoke
coming
from
the
furnaces
said
i
smoke
said
dick
why
should
you
see
smoke
i
held
my
tongue
and
he
went
on
it
a
nice
place
inside
though
as
plain
as
you
see
outside
as
to
the
crafts
throwing
the
clay
must
be
jolly
work
the
is
rather
a
sweltering
job
but
some
folk
like
it
very
much
indeed
and
i
do
much
wonder
there
is
such
a
sense
of
power
when
you
have
got
deft
in
it
in
dealing
with
the
hot
metal
it
makes
a
lot
of
pleasant
work
said
he
smiling
for
however
much
care
you
take
of
such
goods
break
they
will
one
day
or
another
so
there
is
always
plenty
to
do
i
held
my
tongue
and
pondered
we
came
just
here
on
a
gang
of
men
which
delayed
us
a
little
but
i
was
not
sorry
for
it
for
all
i
had
seen
hitherto
seemed
a
mere
part
of
a
summer
holiday
and
i
wanted
to
see
how
this
folk
would
set
to
on
a
piece
of
real
necessary
work
they
had
been
resting
and
had
only
just
begun
work
again
as
we
came
up
so
that
the
rattle
of
the
picks
was
what
woke
me
from
my
musing
there
were
about
a
dozen
of
them
strong
young
men
looking
much
like
a
boating
party
at
oxford
would
have
looked
in
the
days
i
remembered
and
not
more
troubled
with
their
work
their
outer
raiment
lay
on
the
in
an
orderly
pile
under
the
guardianship
of
a
boy
who
had
his
arm
thrown
over
the
neck
of
a
big
mastiff
who
was
as
happily
lazy
as
if
the
had
been
made
for
him
alone
as
i
eyed
the
pile
of
clothes
i
could
see
the
gleam
of
gold
and
silk
embroidery
on
it
and
judged
that
some
of
these
workmen
had
tastes
akin
to
those
of
the
golden
dustman
of
hammersmith
beside
them
lay
a
good
big
basket
that
had
hints
about
it
of
cold
pie
and
wine
a
half
dozen
of
young
women
stood
by
watching
the
work
or
the
workers
both
of
which
were
worth
watching
for
the
latter
smote
great
strokes
and
were
very
deft
in
their
labour
and
as
handsome
fellows
as
you
might
find
a
dozen
of
in
a
summer
day
they
were
laughing
and
talking
merrily
with
each
other
and
the
women
but
presently
their
foreman
looked
up
and
saw
our
way
stopped
so
he
stayed
his
pick
and
sang
out
spell
ho
mates
here
are
neighbours
want
to
get
past
whereon
the
others
stopped
also
and
drawing
around
us
helped
the
old
horse
by
easing
our
wheels
over
the
half
undone
road
and
then
like
men
with
a
pleasant
task
on
hand
hurried
back
to
their
work
only
stopping
to
give
us
a
smiling
so
that
the
sound
of
the
picks
broke
out
again
before
greylocks
had
taken
to
his
dick
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
at
them
and
said
they
are
in
luck
it
right
down
good
sport
trying
how
much
work
one
can
get
into
an
hour
and
i
can
see
those
neighbours
know
their
business
well
it
is
not
a
mere
matter
of
strength
getting
on
quickly
with
such
work
is
it
guest
i
should
think
not
said
i
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
never
tried
my
hand
at
it
really
said
he
gravely
that
seems
a
pity
it
is
good
work
for
hardening
the
muscles
and
i
like
it
though
i
admit
it
is
pleasanter
the
second
week
than
the
first
not
that
i
am
a
good
hand
at
it
the
fellows
used
to
chaff
me
at
one
job
where
i
was
working
i
remember
and
sing
out
to
me
rowed
stroke
your
back
into
it
bow
not
much
of
a
joke
quoth
i
well
said
dick
everything
seems
like
a
joke
when
we
have
a
pleasant
spell
of
work
on
and
good
fellows
merry
about
us
we
feels
so
happy
you
know
again
i
pondered
silently
chapter
viii
an
old
friend
we
now
turned
into
a
pleasant
lane
where
the
branches
of
great
nearly
met
overhead
but
behind
them
lay
low
houses
standing
rather
close
together
this
is
long
acre
quoth
dick
so
there
must
once
have
been
a
cornfield
here
how
curious
it
is
that
places
change
so
and
yet
keep
their
old
names
just
look
how
thick
the
houses
stand
and
they
are
still
going
on
building
look
you
yes
said
the
old
man
but
i
think
the
cornfields
must
have
been
built
over
before
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
have
heard
that
about
here
was
one
of
the
thickest
parts
of
the
town
but
i
must
get
down
here
neighbours
i
have
got
to
call
on
a
friend
who
lives
in
the
gardens
behind
this
long
acre
and
good
luck
guest
and
he
jumped
down
and
strode
away
vigorously
like
a
young
man
how
old
should
you
say
that
neighbour
will
be
said
i
to
dick
as
we
lost
sight
of
him
for
i
saw
that
he
was
old
and
yet
he
looked
dry
and
sturdy
like
a
piece
of
old
oak
a
type
of
old
man
i
was
not
used
to
seeing
o
about
ninety
i
should
say
said
dick
how
your
people
must
be
said
i
yes
said
dick
certainly
we
have
beaten
the
of
the
old
jewish
but
then
you
see
that
was
written
of
syria
a
hot
dry
country
where
people
live
faster
than
in
our
temperate
climate
however
i
do
think
it
matters
much
so
long
as
a
man
is
healthy
and
happy
while
he
alive
but
now
guest
we
are
so
near
to
my
old
kinsman
that
i
think
you
had
better
keep
all
future
questions
for
him
i
nodded
a
yes
and
therewith
we
turned
to
the
left
and
went
down
a
gentle
slope
through
some
beautiful
laid
out
on
what
i
took
to
be
the
site
of
endell
street
we
passed
on
and
dick
drew
rein
an
instant
as
we
came
across
a
long
straightish
road
with
houses
scantily
scattered
up
and
down
it
he
waved
his
hand
right
and
left
and
said
holborn
that
side
oxford
road
that
this
was
once
a
very
important
part
of
the
crowded
city
outside
the
ancient
walls
of
the
roman
and
mediaeval
burg
many
of
the
feudal
nobles
of
the
middle
ages
we
are
told
had
big
houses
on
either
side
of
holborn
i
daresay
you
remember
that
the
bishop
of
ely
house
is
mentioned
in
shakespeare
play
of
king
richard
iii
and
there
are
some
remains
of
that
still
left
however
this
road
is
not
of
the
same
importance
now
that
the
ancient
city
is
gone
walls
and
all
he
drove
on
again
while
i
smiled
faintly
to
think
how
the
nineteenth
century
of
which
such
big
words
have
been
said
counted
for
nothing
in
the
memory
of
this
man
who
read
shakespeare
and
had
not
forgotten
the
middle
ages
we
crossed
the
road
into
a
short
narrow
lane
between
the
gardens
and
came
out
again
into
a
wide
road
on
one
side
of
which
was
a
great
and
long
building
turning
its
gables
away
from
the
highway
which
i
saw
at
once
was
another
public
group
opposite
to
it
was
a
wide
space
of
greenery
without
any
wall
or
fence
of
any
kind
i
looked
through
the
trees
and
saw
beyond
them
a
pillared
portico
quite
familiar
to
me
no
less
old
a
friend
in
fact
than
the
british
museum
it
rather
took
my
breath
away
amidst
all
the
strange
things
i
had
seen
but
i
held
my
tongue
and
let
dick
speak
said
he
yonder
is
the
british
museum
where
my
mostly
lives
so
i
wo
say
much
about
it
the
building
on
the
left
is
the
museum
market
and
i
think
we
had
better
turn
in
there
for
a
minute
or
two
for
greylocks
will
be
wanting
his
rest
and
his
oats
and
i
suppose
you
will
stay
with
my
kinsman
the
greater
part
of
the
day
and
to
say
the
truth
there
may
be
some
one
there
whom
i
particularly
want
to
see
and
perhaps
have
a
long
talk
with
he
blushed
and
sighed
not
altogether
with
pleasure
i
thought
so
of
course
i
said
nothing
and
he
turned
the
horse
under
an
archway
which
brought
us
into
a
very
large
paved
quadrangle
with
a
big
sycamore
tree
in
each
corner
and
a
plashing
fountain
in
the
midst
near
the
fountain
were
a
few
market
stalls
with
awnings
over
them
of
gay
striped
linen
cloth
about
which
some
people
mostly
women
and
children
were
moving
quietly
looking
at
the
goods
exposed
there
the
ground
floor
of
the
building
round
the
quadrangle
was
occupied
by
a
wide
arcade
or
cloister
whose
fanciful
but
strong
architecture
i
could
not
enough
admire
here
also
a
few
people
were
sauntering
or
sitting
reading
on
the
benches
dick
said
to
me
apologetically
here
as
elsewhere
there
is
little
doing
on
a
friday
you
would
see
it
thronged
and
gay
with
people
and
in
the
afternoon
there
is
generally
music
about
the
fountain
however
i
daresay
we
shall
have
a
pretty
good
gathering
at
our
meal
we
drove
through
the
quadrangle
and
by
an
archway
into
a
large
handsome
stable
on
the
other
side
where
we
speedily
stalled
the
old
nag
and
made
him
happy
with
and
then
turned
and
walked
back
again
through
the
market
dick
looking
rather
thoughtful
as
it
seemed
to
me
i
noticed
that
people
could
help
looking
at
me
rather
hard
and
considering
my
clothes
and
theirs
i
did
wonder
but
whenever
they
caught
my
eye
they
made
me
a
very
friendly
sign
of
greeting
we
walked
straight
into
the
forecourt
of
the
museum
where
except
that
the
railings
were
gone
and
the
whispering
boughs
of
the
trees
were
all
about
nothing
seemed
changed
the
very
pigeons
were
wheeling
about
the
building
and
clinging
to
the
ornaments
of
the
pediment
as
i
had
seen
them
of
old
dick
seemed
grown
a
little
absent
but
he
could
not
forbear
giving
me
an
architectural
note
and
said
it
is
rather
an
ugly
old
building
is
it
many
people
have
wanted
to
pull
it
down
and
rebuild
it
and
perhaps
if
work
does
really
get
scarce
we
may
yet
do
so
but
as
my
great
grandfather
will
tell
you
it
would
not
be
quite
a
straightforward
job
for
there
are
wonderful
collections
in
there
of
all
kinds
of
antiquities
besides
an
enormous
library
with
many
exceedingly
beautiful
books
in
it
and
many
most
useful
ones
as
genuine
records
texts
of
ancient
works
and
the
like
and
the
worry
and
anxiety
and
even
risk
there
would
be
in
moving
all
this
has
saved
the
buildings
themselves
besides
as
we
said
before
it
is
not
a
bad
thing
to
have
some
record
of
what
our
forefathers
thought
a
handsome
building
for
there
is
plenty
of
labour
and
material
in
it
i
see
there
is
said
i
and
i
quite
agree
with
you
but
now
had
we
better
make
haste
to
see
your
in
fact
i
could
not
help
seeing
that
he
was
rather
dallying
with
the
time
he
said
yes
we
will
go
into
the
house
in
a
minute
my
kinsman
is
too
old
to
do
much
work
in
the
museum
where
he
was
a
custodian
of
the
books
for
many
years
but
he
still
lives
here
a
good
deal
indeed
i
think
said
he
smiling
that
he
looks
upon
himself
as
a
part
of
the
books
or
the
books
a
part
of
him
i
do
know
which
he
hesitated
a
little
longer
then
flushing
up
took
my
hand
and
saying
come
along
then
led
me
toward
the
door
of
one
of
the
old
official
dwellings
chapter
ix
concerning
love
your
kinsman
does
much
care
for
beautiful
building
then
said
i
as
we
entered
the
rather
dreary
classical
house
which
indeed
was
as
bare
as
need
be
except
for
some
big
pots
of
the
june
flowers
which
stood
about
here
and
there
though
it
was
very
clean
and
nicely
whitewashed
o
i
do
know
said
dick
rather
absently
he
is
getting
old
certainly
for
he
is
over
a
hundred
and
five
and
no
doubt
he
care
about
moving
but
of
course
he
could
live
in
a
prettier
house
if
he
liked
he
is
not
obliged
to
live
in
one
place
any
more
than
any
one
else
this
way
guest
and
he
led
the
way
upstairs
and
opening
a
door
we
went
into
a
room
of
the
old
type
as
plain
as
the
rest
of
the
house
with
a
few
necessary
pieces
of
furniture
and
those
very
simple
and
even
rude
but
solid
and
with
a
good
deal
of
carving
about
them
well
designed
but
rather
crudely
executed
at
the
furthest
corner
of
the
room
at
a
desk
near
the
window
sat
a
little
old
man
in
a
roomy
oak
chair
well
becushioned
he
was
dressed
in
a
sort
of
norfolk
jacket
of
blue
serge
worn
threadbare
with
breeches
of
the
same
and
grey
worsted
stockings
he
jumped
up
from
his
chair
and
cried
out
in
a
voice
of
considerable
volume
for
such
an
old
man
welcome
dick
my
lad
clara
is
here
and
will
be
more
than
glad
to
see
you
so
keep
your
heart
up
clara
here
quoth
dick
if
i
had
known
i
would
not
have
brought
at
least
i
mean
i
would
he
was
stuttering
and
confused
clearly
because
he
was
anxious
to
say
nothing
to
make
me
feel
one
too
many
but
the
old
man
who
had
not
seen
me
at
first
helped
him
out
by
coming
forward
and
saying
to
me
in
a
kind
tone
pray
pardon
me
for
i
did
not
notice
that
dick
who
is
big
enough
to
hide
anybody
you
know
had
brought
a
friend
with
him
a
most
hearty
welcome
to
you
all
the
more
as
i
almost
hope
that
you
are
going
to
amuse
an
old
man
by
giving
him
news
from
over
sea
for
i
can
see
that
you
are
come
from
over
the
water
and
far
off
countries
he
looked
at
me
thoughtfully
almost
anxiously
as
he
said
in
a
changed
voice
might
i
ask
you
where
you
come
from
as
you
are
so
clearly
a
stranger
i
said
in
an
absent
way
i
used
to
live
in
england
and
now
i
am
come
back
again
and
i
slept
last
night
at
the
hammersmith
guest
house
he
bowed
gravely
but
seemed
i
thought
a
little
disappointed
with
my
answer
as
for
me
i
was
now
looking
at
him
harder
than
good
manners
allowed
of
perhaps
for
in
truth
his
face
as
it
was
seemed
strangely
familiar
to
me
as
if
i
had
seen
it
before
in
a
glass
it
might
be
said
i
to
myself
well
said
the
old
man
wherever
you
come
from
you
are
come
among
friends
and
i
see
my
kinsman
richard
hammond
has
an
air
about
him
as
if
he
had
brought
you
here
for
me
to
do
something
for
you
is
that
so
dick
dick
who
was
getting
still
more
and
kept
looking
uneasily
at
the
door
managed
to
say
well
yes
kinsman
our
guest
finds
things
much
altered
and
can
not
understand
it
nor
can
i
so
i
thought
i
would
bring
him
to
you
since
you
know
more
of
all
that
has
happened
within
the
last
two
hundred
years
than
any
body
else
what
that
and
he
turned
toward
the
door
again
we
heard
footsteps
outside
the
door
opened
and
in
came
a
very
beautiful
young
woman
who
stopped
short
on
seeing
dick
and
flushed
as
red
as
a
rose
but
faced
him
nevertheless
dick
looked
at
her
hard
and
half
reached
out
his
hand
toward
her
and
his
whole
face
quivered
with
emotion
the
old
man
did
not
leave
them
long
in
this
shy
discomfort
but
said
smiling
with
an
old
man
mirth
dick
my
lad
and
you
my
dear
clara
i
rather
think
that
we
two
oldsters
are
in
your
way
for
i
think
you
will
have
plenty
to
say
to
each
other
you
had
better
go
into
nelson
room
up
above
i
know
he
has
gone
out
and
he
has
just
been
covering
the
walls
all
over
with
mediaeval
books
so
it
will
be
pretty
enough
even
for
you
two
and
your
renewed
pleasure
the
girl
reached
out
her
hand
to
dick
and
taking
his
led
him
out
of
the
room
looking
straight
before
her
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
her
blushes
came
from
happiness
not
anger
as
indeed
love
is
far
more
conscious
than
wrath
when
the
door
had
shut
on
them
the
old
man
turned
to
me
still
smiling
and
said
frankly
my
dear
guest
you
will
do
me
a
great
service
if
you
are
come
to
set
my
old
tongue
wagging
my
love
of
talk
still
abides
with
me
or
rather
grows
on
me
and
though
it
is
pleasant
enough
to
see
these
youngsters
moving
about
and
playing
together
so
seriously
as
if
the
whole
world
depended
on
their
kisses
as
indeed
it
does
somewhat
yet
i
do
think
my
tales
of
the
past
interest
them
much
the
last
harvest
the
last
baby
the
last
knot
of
carving
in
the
is
history
enough
for
them
it
was
different
i
think
when
i
was
a
lad
when
we
were
not
so
assured
of
peace
and
continuous
plenty
as
we
are
now
well
well
without
putting
you
to
the
question
let
me
ask
you
this
am
i
to
consider
you
as
an
enquirer
who
knows
a
little
of
our
modern
ways
of
life
or
as
one
who
comes
from
some
place
where
the
very
foundations
of
life
are
different
from
ours
do
you
know
anything
or
nothing
about
us
he
looked
at
me
keenly
and
with
growing
wonder
in
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
and
i
answered
in
a
low
voice
i
know
only
so
much
of
your
modern
life
as
i
could
gather
from
using
my
eyes
on
the
way
here
from
hammersmith
and
from
asking
some
questions
of
richard
hammond
most
of
which
he
could
hardly
understand
the
old
man
smiled
at
this
then
said
he
i
am
to
speak
to
you
as
as
if
i
were
a
being
from
another
planet
said
i
the
old
man
whose
name
by
the
bye
like
his
kinsman
was
hammond
smiled
and
nodded
and
wheeling
his
seat
round
to
me
bade
me
sit
in
a
heavy
oak
chair
and
said
as
he
saw
my
eyes
fix
on
its
curious
carving
yes
i
am
much
tied
to
the
past
my
past
you
understand
these
very
pieces
of
furniture
belong
to
a
time
before
my
early
days
it
was
my
father
who
got
them
made
if
they
had
been
done
within
the
last
fifty
years
they
would
have
been
much
cleverer
in
execution
but
i
do
think
i
should
have
liked
them
the
better
we
were
almost
beginning
again
in
those
days
and
they
were
brisk
times
but
you
hear
how
garrulous
i
am
ask
me
questions
ask
me
questions
about
anything
dear
guest
since
i
must
talk
make
my
talk
profitable
to
you
i
was
silent
for
a
minute
and
then
i
said
somewhat
nervously
excuse
me
if
i
am
rude
but
i
am
so
much
interested
in
richard
since
he
has
been
so
kind
to
me
a
perfect
stranger
that
i
should
like
to
ask
a
question
about
him
well
said
old
hammond
if
he
were
not
as
you
call
it
to
a
perfect
stranger
he
would
be
thought
a
strange
person
and
people
would
be
apt
to
shun
him
but
ask
on
ask
on
do
be
shy
of
asking
said
i
that
beautiful
girl
is
he
going
to
be
married
to
her
well
said
he
yes
he
is
he
has
been
married
to
her
once
already
and
now
i
should
say
it
is
pretty
clear
that
he
will
be
married
to
her
again
indeed
quoth
i
wondering
what
that
meant
here
is
the
whole
tale
said
old
hammond
a
short
one
enough
and
now
i
hope
a
happy
one
they
lived
together
two
years
the
first
time
were
both
very
young
and
then
she
got
it
into
her
head
that
she
was
in
love
with
somebody
else
so
she
left
poor
dick
i
say
dick
because
he
had
not
found
any
one
else
but
it
did
not
last
long
only
about
a
year
then
she
came
to
me
as
she
was
in
the
habit
of
bringing
her
troubles
to
the
old
carle
and
asked
me
how
dick
was
and
whether
he
was
happy
and
all
the
rest
of
it
so
i
saw
how
the
land
lay
and
said
that
he
was
very
unhappy
and
not
at
all
well
which
last
at
any
rate
was
a
lie
there
you
can
guess
the
rest
clara
came
to
have
a
long
talk
with
me
but
dick
will
serve
her
turn
much
better
indeed
if
he
had
chanced
in
upon
me
i
should
have
had
to
have
sent
for
him
dear
me
said
i
have
they
any
children
yes
said
he
two
they
are
staying
with
one
of
my
daughters
at
present
where
indeed
clara
has
mostly
been
i
would
lose
sight
of
her
as
i
felt
sure
they
would
come
together
again
and
dick
who
is
the
best
of
good
fellows
really
took
the
matter
to
heart
you
see
he
had
no
other
love
to
run
to
as
she
had
so
i
managed
it
all
as
i
have
done
with
matters
before
ah
said
i
no
doubt
you
wanted
to
keep
them
out
of
the
divorce
court
but
i
suppose
it
often
has
to
settle
such
matters
then
you
suppose
nonsense
said
he
i
know
that
there
used
to
be
such
lunatic
affairs
as
but
just
consider
all
the
cases
that
came
into
them
were
matters
of
property
quarrels
and
i
think
dear
guest
said
he
smiling
that
though
you
do
come
from
another
planet
you
can
see
from
the
mere
outside
look
of
our
world
that
quarrels
about
private
property
could
not
go
on
amongst
us
in
our
days
indeed
my
drive
from
hammersmith
to
bloomsbury
and
all
the
quiet
happy
life
i
had
seen
so
many
hints
of
even
apart
from
my
shopping
would
have
been
enough
to
tell
me
that
the
sacred
rights
of
property
as
we
used
to
think
of
them
were
now
no
more
so
i
sat
silent
while
the
old
man
took
up
the
thread
of
the
discourse
again
and
said
well
then
property
quarrels
being
no
longer
possible
what
remains
in
these
matters
that
a
court
of
law
could
deal
with
fancy
a
court
for
enforcing
a
contract
of
passion
or
sentiment
if
such
a
thing
were
needed
as
a
ad
of
the
enforcement
of
contract
such
a
folly
would
do
that
for
us
he
was
silent
again
a
little
and
then
said
you
must
understand
once
for
all
that
we
have
changed
these
matters
or
rather
that
our
way
of
looking
at
them
has
changed
as
we
have
changed
within
the
last
two
hundred
years
we
do
not
deceive
ourselves
indeed
or
believe
that
we
can
get
rid
of
all
the
trouble
that
besets
the
dealings
between
the
sexes
we
know
that
we
must
face
the
unhappiness
that
comes
of
man
and
woman
confusing
the
relations
between
natural
passion
and
sentiment
and
the
friendship
which
when
things
go
well
softens
the
awakening
from
passing
illusions
but
we
are
not
so
mad
as
to
pile
up
degradation
on
that
unhappiness
by
engaging
in
sordid
squabbles
about
livelihood
and
position
and
the
power
of
tyrannising
over
the
children
who
have
been
the
results
of
love
or
lust
again
he
paused
awhile
and
again
went
on
calf
love
mistaken
for
a
heroism
that
shall
be
lifelong
yet
early
waning
into
disappointment
the
inexplicable
desire
that
comes
on
a
man
of
riper
years
to
be
the
all
to
some
one
woman
whose
ordinary
human
kindness
and
human
beauty
he
has
idealised
into
superhuman
perfection
and
made
the
one
object
of
his
desire
or
lastly
the
reasonable
longing
of
a
strong
and
thoughtful
man
to
become
the
most
intimate
friend
of
some
beautiful
and
wise
woman
the
very
type
of
the
beauty
and
glory
of
the
world
which
we
love
so
well
as
we
exult
in
all
the
pleasure
and
exaltation
of
spirit
which
goes
with
these
things
so
we
set
ourselves
to
bear
the
sorrow
which
not
unseldom
goes
with
them
also
remembering
those
lines
of
the
ancient
poet
i
quote
roughly
from
memory
one
of
the
many
translations
of
the
nineteenth
century
this
the
gods
have
fashioned
man
grief
and
evil
day
that
still
for
man
hereafter
might
be
the
tale
and
the
lay
well
well
is
little
likely
anyhow
that
all
tales
shall
be
lacking
or
all
sorrow
cured
he
was
silent
for
some
time
and
i
would
not
interrupt
him
at
last
he
began
again
but
you
must
know
that
we
of
these
generations
are
strong
and
healthy
of
body
and
live
easily
we
pass
our
lives
in
reasonable
strife
with
nature
exercising
not
one
side
of
ourselves
only
but
all
sides
taking
the
keenest
pleasure
in
all
the
life
of
the
world
so
it
is
a
point
of
honour
with
us
not
to
be
not
to
suppose
that
the
world
must
cease
because
one
man
is
sorry
therefore
we
should
think
it
foolish
or
if
you
will
criminal
to
exaggerate
these
matters
of
sentiment
and
sensibility
we
are
no
more
inclined
to
eke
out
our
sentimental
sorrows
than
to
cherish
our
bodily
pains
and
we
recognise
that
there
are
other
pleasures
besides
you
must
remember
also
that
we
are
and
that
therefore
beauty
both
in
man
and
woman
is
not
so
fleeting
as
it
was
in
the
days
when
we
were
burdened
so
heavily
by
diseases
so
we
shake
off
these
griefs
in
a
way
which
perhaps
the
sentimentalists
of
other
times
would
think
contemptible
and
unheroic
but
which
we
think
necessary
and
manlike
as
on
the
other
hand
therefore
we
have
ceased
to
be
commercial
in
our
matters
so
also
we
have
ceased
to
be
foolish
the
folly
which
comes
by
nature
the
unwisdom
of
the
immature
man
or
the
older
man
caught
in
a
trap
we
must
put
up
with
that
nor
are
we
much
ashamed
of
it
but
to
be
conventionally
sensitive
or
sentimental
my
friend
i
am
old
and
perhaps
disappointed
but
at
least
i
think
we
have
cast
off
of
the
follies
of
the
older
world
he
paused
as
if
for
some
words
of
mine
but
i
held
my
peace
then
he
went
on
at
least
if
we
suffer
from
the
tyranny
and
fickleness
of
nature
or
our
own
want
of
experience
we
neither
grimace
about
it
nor
lie
if
there
must
be
sundering
betwixt
those
who
meant
never
to
sunder
so
it
must
be
but
there
need
be
no
pretext
of
unity
when
the
reality
of
it
is
gone
nor
do
we
drive
those
who
well
know
that
they
are
incapable
of
it
to
profess
an
undying
sentiment
which
they
can
not
really
feel
thus
it
is
that
as
that
monstrosity
of
venal
lust
is
no
longer
possible
so
also
it
is
no
longer
needed
do
misunderstand
me
you
did
not
seemed
shocked
when
i
told
you
that
there
were
no
to
enforce
contracts
of
sentiment
or
passion
but
so
curiously
are
men
made
that
perhaps
you
will
be
shocked
when
i
tell
you
that
there
is
no
code
of
public
opinion
which
takes
the
place
of
such
courts
and
which
might
be
as
tyrannical
and
unreasonable
as
they
were
i
do
not
say
that
people
do
judge
their
neighbours
conduct
sometimes
doubtless
unfairly
but
i
do
say
that
there
is
no
unvarying
conventional
set
of
rules
by
which
people
are
judged
no
bed
of
procrustes
to
stretch
or
cramp
their
minds
and
lives
no
hypocritical
excommunication
which
people
are
to
pronounce
either
by
unconsidered
habit
or
by
the
unexpressed
threat
of
the
lesser
interdict
if
they
are
lax
in
their
hypocrisy
are
you
shocked
now
no
said
i
with
some
hesitation
it
is
all
so
different
at
any
rate
said
he
one
thing
i
think
i
can
answer
for
whatever
sentiment
there
is
it
is
real
and
general
it
is
not
confined
to
people
very
specially
refined
i
am
also
pretty
sure
as
i
hinted
to
you
just
now
that
there
is
not
by
a
great
way
as
much
suffering
involved
in
these
matters
either
to
men
or
to
women
as
there
used
to
be
but
excuse
me
for
being
so
prolix
on
this
question
you
know
you
asked
to
be
treated
like
a
being
from
another
planet
indeed
i
thank
you
very
much
said
i
now
may
i
ask
you
about
the
position
of
women
in
your
society
he
laughed
very
heartily
for
a
man
of
his
years
and
said
it
is
not
without
reason
that
i
have
got
a
reputation
as
a
careful
student
of
history
i
believe
i
really
do
understand
emancipation
of
women
movement
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
doubt
if
any
other
man
now
alive
does
well
said
i
a
little
bit
nettled
by
his
merriment
well
said
he
of
course
you
will
see
that
all
that
is
a
dead
controversy
now
the
men
have
no
longer
any
opportunity
of
tyrannising
over
the
women
or
the
women
over
the
men
both
of
which
things
took
place
in
those
old
times
the
women
do
what
they
can
do
best
and
what
they
like
best
and
the
men
are
neither
jealous
of
it
or
injured
by
it
this
is
such
a
commonplace
that
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
state
it
i
said
o
and
legislation
do
they
take
any
part
in
that
hammond
smiled
and
said
i
think
you
may
wait
for
an
answer
to
that
question
till
we
get
on
to
the
subject
of
legislation
there
may
be
novelties
to
you
in
that
subject
also
very
well
i
said
but
about
this
woman
question
i
saw
at
the
guest
house
that
the
women
were
waiting
on
the
men
that
seems
a
little
like
reaction
does
it
does
it
said
the
old
man
perhaps
you
think
housekeeping
an
unimportant
occupation
not
deserving
of
respect
i
believe
that
was
the
opinion
of
the
women
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
their
male
backers
if
it
is
yours
i
recommend
to
your
notice
an
old
norwegian
tale
called
how
the
man
minded
the
house
or
some
such
title
the
result
of
which
minding
was
that
after
various
tribulations
the
man
and
the
family
cow
balanced
each
other
at
the
end
of
a
rope
the
man
hanging
halfway
up
the
chimney
the
cow
dangling
from
the
roof
which
after
the
fashion
of
the
country
was
of
turf
and
sloping
down
low
to
the
ground
hard
on
the
cow
think
of
course
no
such
mishap
could
happen
to
such
a
superior
person
as
yourself
he
added
chuckling
i
sat
somewhat
uneasy
under
this
dry
gibe
indeed
his
manner
of
treating
this
latter
part
of
the
question
seemed
to
me
a
little
disrespectful
come
now
my
friend
quoth
he
do
you
know
that
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
a
clever
woman
to
manage
a
house
skilfully
and
to
do
it
so
that
all
the
about
her
look
pleased
and
are
grateful
to
her
and
then
you
know
everybody
likes
to
be
ordered
about
by
a
pretty
woman
why
it
is
one
of
the
pleasantest
forms
of
flirtation
you
are
not
so
old
that
you
can
not
remember
that
why
i
remember
it
well
and
the
old
fellow
chuckled
again
and
at
last
fairly
burst
out
laughing
excuse
me
said
he
after
a
while
i
am
not
laughing
at
anything
you
could
be
thinking
of
but
at
that
silly
fashion
current
amongst
rich
cultivated
people
of
ignoring
all
the
steps
by
which
their
daily
dinner
was
reached
as
matters
too
low
for
their
lofty
intelligence
useless
idiots
come
now
i
am
a
man
as
we
queer
animals
used
to
be
called
yet
i
am
a
pretty
good
cook
myself
so
am
i
said
i
well
then
said
he
i
really
think
you
can
understand
me
better
than
you
would
seem
to
do
judging
by
your
words
and
your
silence
said
i
perhaps
that
is
so
but
people
putting
in
practice
commonly
this
sense
of
interest
in
the
ordinary
occupations
of
life
rather
startles
me
i
will
ask
you
a
question
or
two
presently
about
that
but
i
want
to
return
to
the
position
of
women
amongst
you
you
have
studied
the
of
women
business
of
the
nineteenth
century
do
you
remember
that
some
of
the
women
wanted
to
emancipate
the
more
intelligent
part
of
their
sex
from
the
bearing
of
children
the
old
man
grew
quite
serious
again
said
he
i
remember
about
that
strange
piece
of
baseless
folly
the
result
like
all
other
follies
of
the
period
of
the
hideous
class
tyranny
which
then
obtained
what
do
we
think
of
it
now
you
would
say
my
friend
that
is
a
question
easy
to
answer
how
could
it
possibly
be
but
that
maternity
should
be
highly
honoured
amongst
us
surely
it
is
a
matter
of
course
that
the
natural
and
necessary
pains
which
the
mother
must
go
through
form
a
bond
of
union
between
man
and
woman
an
extra
stimulus
to
love
and
affection
between
them
and
that
this
is
universally
recognised
for
the
rest
remember
that
all
the
burdens
of
motherhood
are
now
done
away
with
a
mother
has
no
longer
any
mere
sordid
anxieties
for
the
future
of
her
children
they
may
indeed
turn
out
better
or
worse
they
may
disappoint
her
highest
hopes
such
anxieties
as
these
are
a
part
of
the
mingled
pleasure
and
pain
which
goes
to
make
up
the
life
of
mankind
but
at
least
she
is
spared
the
fear
it
was
most
commonly
the
certainty
that
artificial
disabilities
would
make
her
children
something
less
than
men
and
women
she
knows
that
they
will
live
and
act
according
to
the
measure
of
their
own
faculties
in
times
past
it
is
clear
that
the
of
the
day
helped
its
judaic
god
and
the
of
science
of
the
time
in
visiting
the
sins
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
how
to
reverse
this
process
how
to
take
the
sting
out
of
heredity
has
for
long
been
one
of
the
most
constant
cares
of
the
thoughtful
men
amongst
us
so
that
you
see
the
ordinarily
healthy
woman
and
almost
all
our
women
are
both
healthy
and
at
least
comely
respected
as
a
and
rearer
of
children
desired
as
a
woman
loved
as
a
companion
unanxious
for
the
future
of
her
children
has
far
more
instinct
for
maternity
than
the
poor
drudge
and
mother
of
drudges
of
past
days
could
ever
have
had
or
than
her
sister
of
the
upper
classes
brought
up
in
affected
ignorance
of
natural
facts
reared
in
an
atmosphere
of
mingled
prudery
and
prurience
you
speak
warmly
i
said
but
i
can
see
that
you
are
right
yes
he
said
and
i
will
point
out
to
you
a
token
of
all
the
benefits
which
we
have
gained
by
our
freedom
what
did
you
think
of
the
looks
of
the
people
whom
you
have
come
across
said
i
i
could
hardly
have
believed
that
there
could
be
so
many
looking
people
in
any
civilised
country
he
crowed
a
little
like
the
old
bird
he
was
what
are
we
still
civilised
said
he
well
as
to
our
looks
the
english
and
jutish
blood
which
on
the
whole
is
predominant
here
used
not
to
produce
much
beauty
but
i
think
we
have
improved
it
i
know
a
man
who
has
a
large
collection
of
portraits
printed
from
photographs
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
going
over
those
and
comparing
them
with
the
everyday
faces
in
these
times
puts
the
improvement
in
our
good
looks
beyond
a
doubt
now
there
are
some
people
who
think
it
not
too
fantastic
to
connect
this
increase
of
beauty
directly
with
our
freedom
and
good
sense
in
the
matters
we
have
been
speaking
of
they
believe
that
a
child
born
from
the
natural
and
healthy
love
between
a
man
and
a
woman
even
if
that
be
transient
is
likely
to
turn
out
better
in
all
ways
and
especially
in
bodily
beauty
than
the
birth
of
the
respectable
commercial
marriage
bed
or
of
the
dull
despair
of
the
drudge
of
that
system
they
say
pleasure
begets
pleasure
what
do
you
think
i
am
much
of
that
mind
said
i
chapter
x
questions
and
answers
well
said
the
old
man
shifting
in
his
chair
you
must
get
on
with
your
questions
guest
i
have
been
some
time
answering
this
first
one
said
i
i
want
an
extra
word
or
two
about
your
ideas
of
education
although
i
gathered
from
dick
that
you
let
your
children
run
wild
and
did
teach
them
anything
and
in
short
that
you
have
so
refined
your
education
that
now
you
have
none
then
you
gathered
quoth
he
but
of
course
i
understand
your
point
of
view
about
education
which
is
that
of
times
past
when
struggle
for
life
as
men
used
to
phrase
it
the
struggle
for
a
slave
rations
on
one
side
and
for
a
bouncing
share
of
the
holders
privilege
on
the
other
pinched
for
most
people
into
a
niggardly
dole
of
not
very
accurate
information
something
to
be
swallowed
by
the
beginner
in
the
art
of
living
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
and
was
hungry
for
it
or
not
and
which
had
been
chewed
and
digested
over
and
over
again
by
people
who
did
care
about
it
in
order
to
serve
it
out
to
other
people
who
did
care
about
it
i
stopped
the
old
man
rising
wrath
by
a
laugh
and
said
well
were
not
taught
that
way
at
any
rate
so
you
may
let
your
anger
run
off
you
a
little
true
true
said
he
smiling
i
thank
you
for
correcting
my
i
always
fancy
myself
as
living
in
any
period
of
which
we
may
be
speaking
but
however
to
put
it
in
a
cooler
way
you
expected
to
see
children
thrust
into
schools
when
they
had
reached
an
age
conventionally
supposed
to
be
the
due
age
whatever
their
varying
faculties
and
dispositions
might
be
and
when
there
with
like
disregard
to
facts
to
be
subjected
to
a
certain
conventional
course
of
my
friend
ca
you
see
that
such
a
proceeding
means
ignoring
the
fact
of
bodily
and
mental
no
one
could
come
out
of
such
a
mill
uninjured
and
those
only
would
avoid
being
crushed
by
it
who
would
have
the
spirit
of
rebellion
strong
in
them
fortunately
most
children
have
had
that
at
all
times
or
i
do
not
know
that
we
should
ever
have
reached
our
present
position
now
you
see
what
it
all
comes
to
in
the
old
times
all
this
was
the
result
of
in
the
nineteenth
century
society
was
so
miserably
poor
owing
to
the
systematised
robbery
on
which
it
was
founded
that
real
education
was
impossible
for
anybody
the
whole
theory
of
their
education
was
that
it
was
necessary
to
shove
a
little
information
into
a
child
even
if
it
were
by
means
of
torture
and
accompanied
by
twaddle
which
it
was
well
known
was
of
no
use
or
else
he
would
lack
information
lifelong
the
hurry
of
poverty
forbade
anything
else
all
that
is
past
we
are
no
longer
hurried
and
the
information
lies
ready
to
each
one
hand
when
his
own
inclinations
impel
him
to
seek
it
in
this
as
in
other
matters
we
have
become
wealthy
we
can
afford
to
give
ourselves
time
to
grow
yes
said
i
but
suppose
the
child
youth
man
never
wants
the
information
never
grows
in
the
direction
you
might
hope
him
to
do
suppose
for
instance
he
objects
to
learning
arithmetic
or
mathematics
you
ca
force
him
when
he
grown
ca
you
force
him
while
he
is
growing
and
ought
you
to
do
so
well
said
he
were
you
forced
to
learn
arithmetic
and
mathematics
a
little
said
i
and
how
old
are
you
now
say
said
i
and
how
much
arithmetic
and
mathematics
do
you
know
now
quoth
the
old
man
smiling
rather
mockingly
said
i
none
whatever
i
am
sorry
to
say
hammond
laughed
quietly
but
made
no
other
comment
on
my
admission
and
i
dropped
the
subject
of
education
perceiving
him
to
be
hopeless
on
that
side
i
thought
a
little
and
said
you
were
speaking
just
now
of
households
that
sounded
to
me
a
little
like
the
customs
of
past
times
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
lived
more
in
public
phalangsteries
eh
said
he
well
we
live
as
we
like
and
we
like
to
live
as
a
rule
with
certain
that
we
have
got
used
to
remember
again
that
poverty
is
extinct
and
that
the
fourierist
phalangsteries
and
all
their
kind
as
was
but
natural
at
the
time
implied
nothing
but
a
refuge
from
mere
destitution
such
a
way
of
life
as
that
could
only
have
been
conceived
of
by
people
surrounded
by
the
worst
form
of
poverty
but
you
must
understand
therewith
that
though
separate
households
are
the
rule
amongst
us
and
though
they
differ
in
their
habits
more
or
less
yet
no
door
is
shut
to
any
person
who
is
content
to
live
as
the
other
do
only
of
course
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
one
man
to
drop
into
a
household
and
bid
the
folk
of
it
to
alter
their
habits
to
please
him
since
he
can
go
elsewhere
and
live
as
he
pleases
however
i
need
not
say
much
about
all
this
as
you
are
going
up
the
river
with
dick
and
will
find
out
for
yourself
by
experience
how
these
matters
are
managed
after
a
pause
i
said
your
big
towns
now
how
about
them
london
which
which
i
have
read
about
as
the
modern
babylon
of
civilization
seems
to
have
disappeared
well
well
said
old
hammond
perhaps
after
all
it
is
more
like
ancient
babylon
now
than
the
babylon
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
but
let
that
pass
after
all
there
is
a
good
deal
of
population
in
places
between
here
and
hammersmith
nor
have
you
seen
the
most
populous
part
of
the
town
yet
tell
me
then
said
i
how
is
it
towards
the
east
said
he
time
was
when
if
you
mounted
a
good
horse
and
rode
straight
away
from
my
door
here
at
a
round
trot
for
an
hour
and
a
half
you
would
still
be
in
the
thick
of
london
and
the
greater
part
of
that
would
be
as
they
were
called
that
is
to
say
places
of
torture
for
innocent
men
and
women
or
worse
stews
for
rearing
and
breeding
men
and
women
in
such
degradation
that
that
torture
should
seem
to
them
mere
ordinary
and
natural
life
i
know
i
know
i
said
rather
impatiently
that
was
what
was
tell
me
something
of
what
is
is
any
of
that
left
not
an
inch
said
he
but
some
memory
of
it
abides
with
us
and
i
am
glad
of
it
once
a
year
on
we
hold
a
solemn
feast
in
those
easterly
communes
of
london
to
commemorate
the
clearing
of
misery
as
it
is
called
on
that
day
we
have
music
and
dancing
and
merry
games
and
happy
feasting
on
the
site
of
some
of
the
worst
of
the
old
slums
the
traditional
memory
of
which
we
have
kept
on
that
occasion
the
custom
is
for
the
prettiest
girls
to
sing
some
of
the
old
revolutionary
songs
and
those
which
were
the
groans
of
the
discontent
once
so
hopeless
on
the
very
spots
where
those
terrible
crimes
of
were
committed
day
by
day
for
so
many
years
to
a
man
like
me
who
have
studied
the
past
so
diligently
it
is
a
curious
and
touching
sight
to
see
some
beautiful
girl
daintily
clad
and
crowned
with
flowers
from
the
neighbouring
meadows
standing
amongst
the
happy
people
on
some
mound
where
of
old
time
stood
the
wretched
apology
for
a
house
a
den
in
which
men
and
women
lived
packed
amongst
the
filth
like
pilchards
in
a
cask
lived
in
such
a
way
that
they
could
only
have
endured
it
as
i
said
just
now
by
being
degraded
out
of
humanity
to
hear
the
terrible
words
of
threatening
and
lamentation
coming
from
her
sweet
and
beautiful
lips
and
she
unconscious
of
their
real
meaning
to
hear
her
for
instance
singing
hood
song
of
the
shirt
and
to
think
that
all
the
time
she
does
not
understand
what
it
is
all
about
a
tragedy
grown
inconceivable
to
her
and
her
listeners
think
of
that
if
you
can
and
of
how
glorious
life
is
grown
indeed
said
i
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
think
of
it
and
i
sat
watching
how
his
eyes
glittered
and
how
the
fresh
life
seemed
to
glow
in
his
face
and
i
wondered
how
at
his
age
he
should
think
of
the
happiness
of
the
world
or
indeed
anything
but
his
coming
dinner
tell
me
in
detail
said
i
what
lies
east
of
bloomsbury
now
said
he
there
are
but
few
houses
between
this
and
the
outer
part
of
the
old
city
but
in
the
city
we
have
a
population
our
forefathers
in
the
first
clearing
of
the
slums
were
not
in
a
hurry
to
pull
down
the
houses
in
what
was
called
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
business
quarter
of
the
town
and
what
later
got
to
be
known
as
the
swindling
kens
you
see
these
houses
though
they
stood
hideously
thick
on
the
ground
were
roomy
and
fairly
solid
in
building
and
clean
because
they
were
not
used
for
living
in
but
as
mere
gambling
booths
so
the
poor
people
from
the
cleared
slums
took
them
for
lodgings
and
dwelt
there
till
the
folk
of
those
days
had
time
to
think
of
something
better
for
them
so
the
buildings
were
pulled
down
so
gradually
that
people
got
used
to
living
thicker
on
the
ground
there
than
in
most
places
therefore
it
remains
the
most
populous
part
of
london
or
perhaps
of
all
these
islands
but
it
is
very
pleasant
there
partly
because
of
the
splendour
of
the
architecture
which
goes
further
than
what
you
will
see
elsewhere
however
this
crowding
if
it
may
be
called
so
does
not
go
further
than
a
street
called
aldgate
a
name
which
perhaps
you
may
have
heard
of
beyond
that
the
houses
are
scattered
wide
about
the
meadows
there
which
are
very
beautiful
especially
when
you
get
on
to
the
lovely
river
lea
where
old
isaak
walton
used
to
fish
you
know
about
the
places
called
stratford
and
old
ford
names
which
of
course
you
will
not
have
heard
of
though
the
romans
were
busy
there
once
upon
a
time
not
heard
of
them
thought
i
to
myself
how
strange
that
i
who
had
seen
the
very
last
remnant
of
the
pleasantness
of
the
meadows
by
the
lea
destroyed
should
have
heard
them
spoken
of
with
pleasantness
come
back
to
them
in
full
measure
hammond
went
on
when
you
get
down
to
the
thames
side
you
come
on
the
docks
which
are
works
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
are
still
in
use
although
not
so
thronged
as
they
once
were
since
we
discourage
centralisation
all
we
can
and
we
have
long
ago
dropped
the
pretension
to
be
the
market
of
the
world
about
these
docks
are
a
good
few
houses
which
however
are
not
inhabited
by
many
people
permanently
i
mean
those
who
use
them
come
and
go
a
good
deal
the
place
being
too
low
and
marshy
for
pleasant
dwelling
past
the
docks
eastward
and
landward
it
is
all
flat
pasture
once
marsh
except
for
a
few
gardens
and
there
are
very
few
permanent
dwellings
there
scarcely
anything
but
a
few
sheds
and
cots
for
the
men
who
come
to
look
after
the
great
herds
of
cattle
pasturing
there
but
however
what
with
the
beasts
and
the
men
and
the
scattered
roofs
and
the
big
hayricks
it
does
not
make
a
bad
holiday
to
get
a
quiet
pony
and
ride
about
there
on
a
sunny
afternoon
of
autumn
and
look
over
the
river
and
the
craft
passing
up
and
down
and
on
to
shooters
hill
and
the
kentish
uplands
and
then
turn
round
to
the
wide
green
sea
of
the
essex
with
the
great
domed
line
of
the
sky
and
the
sun
shining
down
in
one
flood
of
peaceful
light
over
the
long
distance
there
is
a
place
called
canning
town
and
further
out
silvertown
where
the
pleasant
meadows
are
at
their
pleasantest
doubtless
they
were
once
slums
and
wretched
enough
the
names
grated
on
my
ear
but
i
could
not
explain
why
to
him
so
i
said
and
south
of
the
river
what
is
it
like
he
said
you
would
find
it
much
the
same
as
the
land
about
hammersmith
north
again
the
land
runs
up
high
and
there
is
an
agreeable
and
built
town
called
hampstead
which
fitly
ends
london
on
that
side
it
looks
down
on
the
end
of
the
forest
you
passed
through
i
smiled
so
much
for
what
was
once
london
said
i
now
tell
me
about
the
other
towns
of
the
country
he
said
as
to
the
big
murky
places
which
were
once
as
we
know
the
centres
of
manufacture
they
have
like
the
brick
and
mortar
desert
of
london
disappeared
only
since
they
were
centres
of
nothing
but
and
served
no
purpose
but
that
of
the
gambling
market
they
have
left
less
signs
of
their
existence
than
london
of
course
the
great
change
in
the
use
of
mechanical
force
made
this
an
easy
matter
and
some
approach
to
their
as
centres
would
probably
have
taken
place
even
if
we
had
not
changed
our
habits
so
much
but
they
being
such
as
they
were
no
sacrifice
would
have
seemed
too
great
a
price
to
pay
for
getting
rid
of
the
districts
as
they
used
to
be
called
for
the
rest
whatever
coal
or
mineral
we
need
is
brought
to
grass
and
sent
whither
it
is
needed
with
as
little
as
possible
of
dirt
confusion
and
the
distressing
of
quiet
people
lives
one
is
tempted
to
believe
from
what
one
has
read
of
the
condition
of
those
districts
in
the
nineteenth
century
that
those
who
had
them
under
their
power
worried
befouled
and
degraded
men
out
of
malice
prepense
but
it
was
not
so
like
the
of
which
we
were
talking
just
now
it
came
of
their
dreadful
poverty
they
were
obliged
to
put
up
with
everything
and
even
pretend
that
they
liked
it
whereas
we
can
now
deal
with
things
reasonably
and
refuse
to
be
saddled
with
what
we
do
not
want
i
confess
i
was
not
sorry
to
cut
short
with
a
question
his
glorifications
of
the
age
he
lived
in
said
i
how
about
the
smaller
towns
i
suppose
you
have
swept
those
away
entirely
no
no
said
he
it
has
gone
that
way
on
the
contrary
there
has
been
but
little
clearance
though
much
rebuilding
in
the
smaller
towns
their
suburbs
indeed
when
they
had
any
have
melted
away
into
the
general
country
and
space
and
has
been
got
in
their
centres
but
there
are
the
towns
still
with
their
streets
and
squares
and
places
so
that
it
is
by
means
of
these
smaller
towns
that
we
of
can
get
some
kind
of
idea
of
what
the
towns
of
the
older
world
were
like
i
mean
to
say
at
their
best
take
oxford
for
instance
said
i
yes
said
he
i
suppose
oxford
was
beautiful
even
in
the
nineteenth
century
at
present
it
has
the
great
interest
of
still
preserving
a
great
mass
of
building
and
is
a
very
beautiful
place
yet
there
are
many
towns
which
have
become
scarcely
less
beautiful
said
i
in
passing
may
i
ask
if
it
is
still
a
place
of
learning
still
said
he
smiling
well
it
has
reverted
to
some
of
its
best
traditions
so
you
may
imagine
how
far
it
is
from
its
position
it
is
real
learning
knowledge
cultivated
for
its
own
sake
the
art
of
knowledge
in
short
which
is
followed
there
not
the
commercial
learning
of
the
past
though
perhaps
you
do
not
know
that
in
the
nineteenth
century
oxford
and
its
less
interesting
sister
cambridge
became
definitely
commercial
they
and
especially
oxford
were
the
breeding
places
of
a
peculiar
class
of
parasites
who
called
themselves
cultivated
people
they
were
indeed
cynical
enough
as
the
educated
classes
of
the
day
generally
were
but
they
affected
an
exaggeration
of
cynicism
in
order
that
they
might
be
thought
knowing
and
the
rich
middle
classes
they
had
no
relation
with
the
working
classes
treated
them
with
the
kind
of
contemptuous
toleration
with
which
a
mediaeval
baron
treated
his
jester
though
it
must
be
said
that
they
were
by
no
means
so
pleasant
as
the
old
jesters
were
being
in
fact
bores
of
society
they
were
laughed
at
despised
and
paid
which
last
was
what
they
aimed
at
dear
me
thought
i
how
apt
history
is
to
reverse
contemporary
judgments
surely
only
the
worst
of
them
were
as
bad
as
that
but
i
must
admit
that
they
were
mostly
prigs
and
that
they
commercial
i
said
aloud
though
more
to
myself
than
to
hammond
well
how
could
they
be
better
than
the
age
that
made
them
true
he
said
but
their
pretensions
were
higher
were
they
said
i
smiling
you
drive
me
from
corner
to
corner
said
he
smiling
in
turn
let
me
say
at
least
that
they
were
a
poor
sequence
to
the
aspirations
of
oxford
of
barbarous
middle
ages
yes
that
will
do
said
i
also
said
hammond
what
i
have
been
saying
of
them
is
true
in
the
main
but
ask
on
i
said
we
have
heard
about
london
and
the
manufacturing
districts
and
the
ordinary
towns
how
about
the
villages
said
hammond
you
must
know
that
toward
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
villages
were
almost
destroyed
unless
where
they
became
mere
adjuncts
to
the
manufacturing
districts
or
formed
a
sort
of
minor
manufacturing
districts
themselves
houses
were
allowed
to
fall
into
decay
and
actual
ruin
trees
were
cut
down
for
the
sake
of
the
few
shillings
which
the
poor
sticks
would
fetch
the
building
became
inexpressibly
mean
and
hideous
labour
was
scarce
but
wages
fell
nevertheless
all
the
small
country
arts
of
life
which
once
added
to
the
little
pleasures
of
country
people
were
lost
the
country
produce
which
passed
through
the
hands
of
the
husbandmen
never
got
so
far
as
their
mouths
incredible
shabbiness
and
niggardly
pinching
reigned
over
the
fields
and
acres
which
in
spite
of
the
rude
and
careless
husbandry
of
the
times
were
so
kind
and
bountiful
had
you
any
inkling
of
all
this
i
have
heard
that
it
was
so
said
i
but
what
followed
the
change
said
hammond
which
in
these
matters
took
place
very
early
in
our
epoch
was
most
strangely
rapid
people
flocked
into
the
country
villages
and
so
to
say
flung
themselves
upon
the
freed
land
like
a
wild
beast
upon
his
prey
and
in
a
very
little
time
the
villages
of
england
were
more
populous
than
they
had
been
since
the
fourteenth
century
and
were
still
growing
fast
of
course
this
invasion
of
the
country
was
awkward
to
deal
with
and
would
have
created
much
misery
if
the
folk
had
still
been
under
the
bondage
of
class
monopoly
but
as
it
was
things
soon
righted
themselves
people
found
out
what
they
were
fit
for
and
gave
up
attempting
to
push
themselves
into
occupations
in
which
they
must
needs
fail
the
town
invaded
the
country
but
the
invaders
like
the
warlike
invaders
of
early
days
yielded
to
the
influence
of
their
surroundings
and
became
country
people
and
in
their
turn
as
they
became
more
numerous
than
the
townsmen
influenced
them
also
so
that
the
difference
between
town
and
country
grew
less
and
less
and
it
was
indeed
this
world
of
the
country
vivified
by
the
thought
and
briskness
of
bred
folk
which
has
produced
that
happy
and
leisurely
but
eager
life
of
which
you
have
had
a
first
taste
again
i
say
many
blunders
were
made
but
we
have
had
time
to
set
them
right
much
was
left
for
the
men
of
my
earlier
life
to
deal
with
the
crude
ideas
of
the
first
half
of
the
twentieth
century
when
men
were
still
oppressed
by
the
fear
of
poverty
and
did
not
look
enough
to
the
present
pleasure
of
ordinary
daily
life
spoilt
a
great
deal
of
what
the
commercial
age
had
left
us
of
external
beauty
and
i
admit
that
it
was
but
slowly
that
men
recovered
from
the
injuries
that
they
inflicted
on
themselves
even
after
they
became
free
but
slowly
as
the
recovery
came
it
come
and
the
more
you
see
of
us
the
clearer
it
will
be
to
you
that
we
are
happy
that
we
live
amidst
beauty
without
any
fear
of
becoming
effeminate
that
we
have
plenty
to
do
and
on
the
whole
enjoy
doing
it
what
more
can
we
ask
of
life
he
paused
as
if
he
were
seeking
for
words
with
which
to
express
his
thought
then
he
said
this
is
how
we
stand
england
was
once
a
country
of
clearings
amongst
the
woods
and
wastes
with
a
few
towns
interspersed
which
were
fortresses
for
the
feudal
army
markets
for
the
folk
gathering
places
for
the
craftsmen
it
then
became
a
country
of
huge
and
foul
workshops
and
fouler
surrounded
by
an
farm
pillaged
by
the
masters
of
the
workshops
it
is
now
a
garden
where
nothing
is
wasted
and
nothing
is
spoilt
with
the
necessary
dwellings
sheds
and
workshops
scattered
up
and
down
the
country
all
trim
and
neat
and
pretty
for
indeed
we
should
be
too
much
ashamed
of
ourselves
if
we
allowed
the
making
of
goods
even
on
a
large
scale
to
carry
with
it
the
appearance
even
of
desolation
and
misery
why
my
friend
those
housewives
we
were
talking
of
just
now
would
teach
us
better
than
that
said
i
this
side
of
your
change
is
certainly
for
the
better
but
though
i
shall
soon
see
some
of
these
villages
tell
me
in
a
word
or
two
what
they
are
like
just
to
prepare
me
perhaps
said
he
you
have
seen
a
tolerable
picture
of
these
villages
as
they
were
before
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
such
things
exist
i
have
seen
several
of
such
pictures
said
i
well
said
hammond
our
villages
are
something
like
the
best
of
such
places
with
the
church
or
of
the
neighbours
for
their
chief
building
only
note
that
there
are
no
tokens
of
poverty
about
them
no
picturesque
which
to
tell
you
the
truth
the
artist
usually
availed
himself
of
to
veil
his
incapacity
for
drawing
architecture
such
things
do
not
please
us
even
when
they
indicate
no
misery
like
the
mediaevals
we
like
everything
trim
and
clean
and
orderly
and
bright
as
people
always
do
when
they
have
any
sense
of
architectural
power
because
then
they
know
that
they
can
have
what
they
want
and
they
wo
stand
any
nonsense
from
nature
in
their
dealings
with
her
besides
the
villages
are
there
any
scattered
country
houses
said
i
yes
plenty
said
hammond
in
fact
except
in
the
wastes
and
forests
and
amongst
the
like
hindhead
in
surrey
it
is
not
easy
to
be
out
of
sight
of
a
house
and
where
the
houses
are
thinly
scattered
they
run
large
and
are
more
like
the
old
colleges
than
ordinary
houses
as
they
used
to
be
that
is
done
for
the
sake
of
society
for
a
good
many
people
can
dwell
in
such
houses
as
the
country
dwellers
are
not
necessarily
husbandmen
though
they
almost
all
help
in
such
work
at
times
the
life
that
goes
on
in
these
big
dwellings
in
the
country
is
very
pleasant
especially
as
some
of
the
most
studious
men
of
our
time
live
in
them
and
altogether
there
is
a
great
variety
of
mind
and
mood
to
be
found
in
them
which
brightens
and
quickens
the
society
there
i
am
rather
surprised
said
i
by
all
this
for
it
seems
to
me
that
after
all
the
country
must
be
tolerably
populous
certainly
said
he
the
population
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
we
have
spread
it
that
is
all
of
course
also
we
have
helped
to
populate
other
countries
where
we
were
wanted
and
were
called
for
said
i
one
thing
it
seems
to
me
does
not
go
with
your
word
of
for
the
country
you
have
spoken
of
wastes
and
forests
and
i
myself
have
seen
the
beginning
of
your
middlesex
and
essex
forest
why
do
you
keep
such
things
in
a
garden
and
is
it
very
wasteful
to
do
so
my
friend
he
said
we
like
these
pieces
of
wild
nature
and
can
afford
them
so
we
have
them
let
alone
that
as
to
the
forests
we
need
a
great
deal
of
timber
and
suppose
that
our
sons
and
sons
sons
will
do
the
like
as
to
the
land
being
a
garden
i
have
heard
that
they
used
to
have
shrubberies
and
rockeries
in
gardens
once
and
though
i
might
not
like
the
artificial
ones
i
assure
you
that
some
of
the
natural
rockeries
of
our
garden
are
worth
seeing
go
north
this
summer
and
look
at
the
cumberland
and
westmoreland
ones
where
by
the
way
you
will
see
some
so
that
they
are
not
so
wasteful
as
you
think
not
so
wasteful
as
for
fruit
out
of
season
think
go
and
have
a
look
at
the
high
up
the
slopes
between
ingleborough
and
and
tell
me
if
you
think
we
the
land
there
by
not
covering
it
with
factories
for
making
things
that
nobody
wants
which
was
the
chief
business
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
will
try
to
go
there
said
i
it
wo
take
much
trying
said
he
chapter
xi
concerning
government
now
said
i
i
have
come
to
the
point
of
asking
questions
which
i
suppose
will
be
dry
for
you
to
answer
and
difficult
for
you
to
explain
but
i
have
foreseen
for
some
time
past
that
i
must
ask
them
will
i
i
what
kind
of
a
government
have
you
has
republicanism
finally
triumphed
or
have
you
come
to
a
mere
dictatorship
which
some
persons
in
the
nineteenth
century
used
to
prophesy
as
the
ultimate
outcome
of
democracy
indeed
this
last
question
does
not
seem
so
very
unreasonable
since
you
have
turned
your
parliament
house
into
a
market
or
where
do
you
house
your
present
parliament
the
old
man
answered
my
smile
with
a
hearty
laugh
and
said
well
well
dung
is
not
the
worst
kind
of
corruption
fertility
may
come
of
that
whereas
mere
dearth
came
from
the
other
kind
of
which
those
walls
once
held
the
great
supporters
now
dear
guest
let
me
tell
you
that
our
present
parliament
would
be
hard
to
house
in
one
place
because
the
whole
people
is
our
parliament
i
do
understand
said
i
no
i
suppose
not
said
he
i
must
now
shock
you
by
telling
you
that
we
have
no
longer
anything
which
you
a
native
of
another
planet
would
call
a
government
i
am
not
so
much
shocked
as
you
might
think
said
i
as
i
know
something
about
governments
but
tell
me
how
do
you
manage
and
how
have
you
come
to
this
state
of
things
said
he
it
is
true
that
we
have
to
make
some
arrangements
about
our
affairs
concerning
which
you
can
ask
presently
and
it
is
also
true
that
everybody
does
not
always
agree
with
the
details
of
these
arrangements
but
further
it
is
true
that
a
man
no
more
needs
an
elaborate
system
of
government
with
its
army
navy
and
police
to
force
him
to
give
way
to
the
will
of
the
majority
of
his
than
he
wants
a
similar
machinery
to
make
him
understand
that
his
head
and
a
stone
wall
can
not
occupy
the
same
space
at
the
same
moment
do
you
want
further
explanation
well
yes
i
do
quoth
i
old
hammond
settled
himself
in
his
chair
with
a
look
of
enjoyment
which
rather
alarmed
me
and
made
me
dread
a
scientific
disquisition
so
i
sighed
and
abided
he
said
i
suppose
you
know
pretty
well
what
the
process
of
government
was
in
the
bad
old
times
i
am
supposed
to
know
said
i
hammond
what
was
the
government
of
those
days
was
it
really
the
parliament
or
any
part
of
it
i
no
was
not
the
parliament
on
the
one
side
a
kind
of
sitting
to
see
that
the
interests
of
the
upper
classes
took
no
hurt
and
on
the
other
side
a
sort
of
blind
to
delude
the
people
into
supposing
that
they
had
some
share
in
the
management
of
their
own
affairs
i
history
seems
to
show
us
this
to
what
extent
did
the
people
manage
their
own
affairs
i
i
judge
from
what
i
have
heard
that
sometimes
they
forced
the
parliament
to
make
a
law
to
legalise
some
alteration
which
had
already
taken
place
anything
else
i
i
think
not
as
i
am
informed
if
the
people
made
any
attempt
to
deal
with
the
of
their
grievances
the
law
stepped
in
and
said
this
is
sedition
revolt
or
what
not
and
slew
or
tortured
the
ringleaders
of
such
attempts
if
parliament
was
not
the
government
then
nor
the
people
either
what
was
the
government
i
can
you
tell
me
i
think
we
shall
not
be
far
wrong
if
we
say
that
government
was
the
backed
up
by
the
executive
which
handled
the
brute
force
that
the
deluded
people
allowed
them
to
use
for
their
own
purposes
i
mean
the
army
navy
and
police
i
reasonable
men
must
needs
think
you
are
right
now
as
to
those
were
they
places
of
fair
dealing
according
to
the
ideas
of
the
day
had
a
poor
man
a
good
chance
of
defending
his
property
and
person
in
them
i
it
is
a
commonplace
that
even
rich
men
looked
upon
a
as
a
dire
misfortune
even
if
they
gained
the
case
and
as
for
a
poor
one
why
it
was
considered
a
miracle
of
justice
and
beneficence
if
a
poor
man
who
had
once
got
into
the
clutches
of
the
law
escaped
prison
or
utter
ruin
it
seems
then
my
son
that
the
government
by
and
police
which
was
the
real
government
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
not
a
great
success
even
to
the
people
of
that
day
living
under
a
class
system
which
proclaimed
inequality
and
poverty
as
the
law
of
god
and
the
bond
which
held
the
world
together
i
so
it
seems
indeed
and
now
that
all
this
is
changed
and
the
rights
of
property
which
mean
the
clenching
the
fist
on
a
piece
of
goods
and
crying
out
to
the
neighbours
you
sha
have
this
now
that
all
this
has
disappeared
so
utterly
that
it
is
no
longer
possible
even
to
jest
upon
its
absurdity
is
such
a
government
possible
i
it
is
impossible
yes
happily
but
for
what
other
purpose
than
the
protection
of
the
rich
from
the
poor
the
strong
from
the
weak
did
this
government
exist
i
i
have
heard
that
it
was
said
that
their
office
was
to
defend
their
own
citizens
against
attack
from
other
countries
it
was
said
but
was
anyone
expected
to
believe
this
for
instance
did
the
english
government
defend
the
english
citizen
against
the
french
i
so
it
was
said
then
if
the
french
had
invaded
england
and
conquered
it
they
would
not
have
allowed
the
english
workmen
to
live
well
i
laughing
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
the
english
masters
of
the
english
workmen
saw
to
that
they
took
from
their
workmen
as
much
of
their
livelihood
as
they
dared
because
they
wanted
it
for
themselves
but
if
the
french
had
conquered
would
they
not
have
taken
more
still
from
the
english
workmen
i
i
do
not
think
so
for
in
that
case
the
english
workmen
would
have
died
of
starvation
and
then
the
french
conquest
would
have
ruined
the
french
just
as
if
the
english
horses
and
cattle
had
died
of
so
that
after
all
the
english
would
have
been
no
worse
off
for
the
conquest
their
french
masters
could
have
got
no
more
from
them
than
their
english
masters
did
this
is
true
and
we
may
admit
that
the
pretensions
of
the
government
to
defend
the
poor
the
useful
people
against
other
countries
come
to
nothing
but
that
is
but
natural
for
we
have
seen
already
that
it
was
the
function
of
government
to
protect
the
rich
against
the
poor
but
did
not
the
government
defend
its
rich
men
against
other
nations
i
i
do
not
remember
to
have
heard
that
the
rich
needed
defence
because
it
is
said
that
even
when
two
nations
were
at
war
the
rich
men
of
each
nation
gambled
with
each
other
pretty
much
as
usual
and
even
sold
each
other
weapons
wherewith
to
kill
their
own
countrymen
in
short
it
comes
to
this
that
whereas
the
government
of
protection
of
property
by
means
of
the
meant
destruction
of
wealth
this
defence
of
the
citizens
of
one
country
against
those
of
another
country
by
means
of
war
or
the
threat
of
war
meant
pretty
much
the
same
thing
i
i
can
not
deny
it
therefore
the
government
really
existed
for
the
destruction
of
wealth
i
so
it
seems
and
yet
yet
what
i
there
were
many
rich
people
in
those
times
you
see
the
consequences
of
that
fact
i
i
think
i
do
but
tell
me
out
what
they
were
if
the
government
habitually
destroyed
wealth
the
country
must
have
been
poor
i
yes
certainly
yet
amidst
this
poverty
the
persons
for
the
sake
of
whom
the
government
existed
insisted
on
being
rich
whatever
might
happen
i
so
it
was
what
must
happen
if
in
a
poor
country
some
people
insist
on
being
rich
at
the
expense
of
the
others
i
unutterable
poverty
for
the
others
all
this
misery
then
was
caused
by
the
destructive
government
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
nay
it
would
be
incorrect
to
say
so
the
government
itself
was
but
the
necessary
result
of
the
careless
aimless
tyranny
of
the
times
it
was
but
the
machinery
of
tyranny
now
tyranny
has
come
to
an
end
and
we
no
longer
need
such
machinery
we
could
not
possibly
use
it
since
we
are
free
therefore
in
your
sense
of
the
word
we
have
no
government
do
you
understand
this
now
i
yes
i
do
but
i
will
ask
you
some
more
questions
as
to
how
you
as
free
men
manage
your
affairs
with
all
my
heart
ask
away
chapter
xii
concerning
the
arrangement
of
life
well
i
said
about
those
which
you
spoke
of
as
taking
the
place
of
government
could
you
give
me
any
account
of
them
neighbour
he
said
although
we
have
simplified
our
lives
a
great
deal
from
what
they
were
and
have
got
rid
of
many
conventionalities
and
many
sham
wants
which
used
to
give
our
forefathers
much
trouble
yet
our
life
is
too
complex
for
me
to
tell
you
in
detail
by
means
of
words
how
it
is
arranged
you
must
find
that
out
by
living
amongst
us
it
is
true
that
i
can
better
tell
you
what
we
do
do
than
what
we
do
do
well
said
i
this
is
the
way
to
put
it
said
he
we
have
been
living
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
at
least
more
or
less
in
our
present
manner
and
a
tradition
or
habit
of
life
has
been
growing
on
us
and
that
habit
has
become
a
habit
of
acting
on
the
whole
for
the
best
it
is
easy
for
us
to
live
without
robbing
each
other
it
would
be
possible
for
us
to
contend
with
and
rob
each
other
but
it
would
be
harder
for
us
than
refraining
from
strife
and
robbery
that
is
in
short
the
foundation
of
our
life
and
our
happiness
whereas
in
the
old
days
said
i
it
was
very
hard
to
live
without
strife
and
robbery
that
what
you
mean
is
it
by
giving
me
the
negative
side
of
your
good
conditions
yes
he
said
it
was
so
hard
that
those
who
habitually
acted
fairly
to
their
neighbours
were
celebrated
as
saints
and
heroes
and
were
looked
up
to
with
the
greatest
reverence
while
they
were
alive
said
i
no
said
he
after
they
were
dead
but
as
to
these
days
i
said
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
no
one
ever
transgresses
this
habit
of
good
fellowship
certainly
not
said
hammond
but
when
the
transgressions
occur
everybody
transgressors
and
all
know
them
for
what
they
are
the
errors
of
friends
not
the
habitual
actions
of
persons
driven
into
enmity
against
society
i
see
said
i
you
mean
that
you
have
no
classes
how
could
we
have
them
said
he
since
there
is
no
rich
class
to
breed
enemies
against
the
state
by
means
of
the
injustice
of
the
state
said
i
i
thought
that
i
understood
from
something
that
fell
from
you
a
little
while
ago
that
you
had
abolished
civil
law
is
that
so
literally
it
abolished
itself
my
friend
said
he
as
i
said
before
the
civil
were
upheld
for
the
defence
of
private
property
for
nobody
ever
pretended
that
it
was
possible
to
make
people
act
fairly
to
each
other
by
means
of
brute
force
well
private
property
being
abolished
all
the
laws
and
all
the
legal
which
it
had
manufactured
of
course
came
to
an
end
thou
shalt
not
steal
had
to
be
translated
into
thou
shalt
work
in
order
to
live
happily
is
there
any
need
to
enforce
that
commandment
by
violence
well
said
i
that
is
understood
and
i
agree
with
it
but
how
about
crimes
of
violence
would
not
their
occurrence
and
you
admit
that
they
occur
make
criminal
law
necessary
said
he
in
your
sense
of
the
word
we
have
no
criminal
law
either
let
us
look
at
the
matter
closer
and
see
whence
crimes
of
violence
spring
by
far
the
greater
part
of
these
in
past
days
were
the
result
of
the
laws
of
private
property
which
forbade
the
satisfaction
of
their
natural
desires
to
all
but
a
privileged
few
and
of
the
general
visible
coercion
which
came
of
those
laws
all
that
cause
of
violent
crime
is
gone
again
many
violent
acts
came
from
the
artificial
perversion
of
the
sexual
passions
which
caused
overweening
jealousy
and
the
like
miseries
now
when
you
look
carefully
into
these
you
will
find
that
what
lay
at
the
bottom
of
them
was
mostly
the
idea
a
idea
of
the
woman
being
the
property
of
the
man
whether
he
were
husband
father
brother
or
what
not
that
idea
has
of
course
vanished
with
private
property
as
well
as
certain
follies
about
the
of
women
for
following
their
natural
desires
in
an
illegal
way
which
of
course
was
a
convention
caused
by
the
laws
of
private
property
another
cognate
cause
of
crimes
of
violence
was
the
family
tyranny
which
was
the
subject
of
so
many
novels
and
stories
of
the
past
and
which
once
more
was
the
result
of
private
property
of
course
that
is
all
ended
since
families
are
held
together
by
no
bond
of
coercion
legal
or
social
but
by
mutual
liking
and
affection
and
everybody
is
free
to
come
or
go
as
he
or
she
pleases
furthermore
our
standards
of
honour
and
public
estimation
are
very
different
from
the
old
ones
success
in
besting
our
neighbours
is
a
road
to
renown
now
closed
let
us
hope
for
ever
each
man
is
free
to
exercise
his
special
faculty
to
the
utmost
and
every
one
encourages
him
in
so
doing
so
that
we
have
got
rid
of
the
scowling
envy
coupled
by
the
poets
with
hatred
and
surely
with
good
reason
heaps
of
unhappiness
and
were
caused
by
it
which
with
irritable
and
passionate
men
energetic
and
active
men
often
led
to
violence
i
laughed
and
said
so
that
you
now
withdraw
your
admission
and
say
that
there
is
no
violence
amongst
you
no
said
he
i
withdraw
nothing
as
i
told
you
such
things
will
happen
hot
blood
will
err
sometimes
a
man
may
strike
another
and
the
stricken
strike
back
again
and
the
result
be
a
homicide
to
put
it
at
the
worst
but
what
then
shall
we
the
neighbours
make
it
worse
still
shall
we
think
so
poorly
of
each
other
as
to
suppose
that
the
slain
man
calls
on
us
to
revenge
him
when
we
know
that
if
he
had
been
maimed
he
would
when
in
cold
blood
and
able
to
weigh
all
the
circumstances
have
forgiven
his
manner
or
will
the
death
of
the
slayer
bring
the
slain
man
to
life
again
and
cure
the
unhappiness
his
loss
has
caused
yes
i
said
but
consider
must
not
the
safety
of
society
be
safeguarded
by
some
punishment
there
neighbour
said
the
old
man
with
some
exultation
you
have
hit
the
mark
that
of
which
men
used
to
talk
so
wisely
and
act
so
foolishly
what
was
it
but
the
expression
of
their
fear
and
they
had
need
to
fear
since
they
the
rulers
of
society
were
dwelling
like
an
armed
band
in
a
hostile
country
but
we
who
live
amongst
our
friends
need
neither
fear
nor
punish
surely
if
we
in
dread
of
an
occasional
rare
homicide
an
occasional
rough
blow
were
solemnly
and
legally
to
commit
homicide
and
violence
we
could
only
be
a
society
of
ferocious
cowards
do
you
think
so
neighbour
yes
i
do
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
from
that
side
said
i
yet
you
must
understand
said
the
old
man
that
when
any
violence
is
committed
we
expect
the
transgressor
to
make
any
atonement
possible
to
him
and
he
himself
expects
it
but
again
think
if
the
destruction
or
serious
injury
of
a
man
momentarily
overcome
by
wrath
or
folly
can
be
any
atonement
to
the
commonwealth
surely
it
can
only
be
an
additional
injury
to
it
said
i
but
suppose
the
man
has
a
habit
of
violence
kills
a
man
a
year
for
instance
such
a
thing
is
unknown
said
he
in
a
society
where
there
is
no
punishment
to
evade
no
law
to
triumph
over
remorse
will
certainly
follow
transgression
and
lesser
outbreaks
of
violence
said
i
how
do
you
deal
with
them
for
hitherto
we
have
been
talking
of
great
tragedies
i
suppose
said
hammond
if
the
is
not
sick
or
mad
in
which
case
he
must
be
restrained
till
his
sickness
or
madness
is
cured
it
is
clear
that
grief
and
humiliation
must
follow
the
and
society
in
general
will
make
that
pretty
clear
to
the
if
he
should
chance
to
be
dull
to
it
and
again
some
kind
of
atonement
will
follow
at
the
least
an
open
acknowledgement
of
the
grief
and
humiliation
is
it
so
hard
to
say
i
ask
your
pardon
neighbour
well
sometimes
it
is
hard
and
let
it
be
you
think
that
enough
said
i
yes
said
he
and
moreover
it
is
all
that
we
do
if
in
addition
we
torture
the
man
we
turn
his
grief
into
anger
and
the
humiliation
he
would
otherwise
feel
for
is
swallowed
up
by
a
hope
of
revenge
for
to
him
he
has
paid
the
legal
penalty
and
can
and
sin
again
with
comfort
shall
we
commit
such
a
folly
then
remember
jesus
had
got
the
legal
penalty
remitted
before
he
said
and
sin
no
more
let
alone
that
in
a
society
of
equals
you
will
not
find
any
one
to
play
the
part
of
torturer
or
jailer
though
many
to
act
as
nurse
or
doctor
so
said
i
you
consider
crime
a
mere
spasmodic
disease
which
requires
no
body
of
criminal
law
to
deal
with
it
pretty
much
so
said
he
and
since
as
i
have
told
you
we
are
a
healthy
people
generally
so
we
are
not
likely
to
be
much
troubled
with
disease
well
you
have
no
civil
law
and
no
criminal
law
but
have
you
no
laws
of
the
market
so
to
say
no
regulation
for
the
exchange
of
wares
for
you
must
exchange
even
if
you
have
no
property
said
he
we
have
no
obvious
individual
exchange
as
you
saw
this
morning
when
you
went
but
of
course
there
are
regulations
of
the
markets
varying
according
to
the
circumstances
and
guided
by
general
custom
but
as
these
are
matters
of
general
assent
which
nobody
dreams
of
objecting
to
so
also
we
have
made
no
provision
for
enforcing
them
therefore
i
do
call
them
laws
in
law
whether
it
be
criminal
or
civil
execution
always
follows
judgment
and
someone
must
suffer
when
you
see
the
judge
on
his
bench
you
see
through
him
as
clearly
as
if
he
were
made
of
glass
the
policeman
to
emprison
and
the
soldier
to
slay
some
actual
living
person
such
follies
would
make
an
agreeable
market
would
they
certainly
said
i
that
means
turning
the
market
into
a
mere
field
in
which
many
people
must
suffer
as
much
as
in
the
of
bullet
and
bayonet
and
from
what
i
have
seen
i
should
suppose
that
your
marketing
great
and
little
is
carried
on
in
a
way
that
makes
it
a
pleasant
occupation
you
are
right
neighbour
said
he
although
there
are
so
many
indeed
by
far
the
greater
number
amongst
us
who
would
be
unhappy
if
they
were
not
engaged
in
actually
making
things
and
things
which
turn
out
beautiful
under
their
hands
there
are
many
like
the
housekeepers
i
was
speaking
of
whose
delight
is
in
administration
and
organisation
to
use
words
i
mean
people
who
like
keeping
things
together
avoiding
waste
seeing
that
nothing
sticks
fast
uselessly
such
people
are
thoroughly
happy
in
their
business
all
the
more
as
they
are
dealing
with
actual
facts
and
not
merely
passing
counters
round
to
see
what
share
they
shall
have
in
the
privileged
taxation
of
useful
people
which
was
the
business
of
the
commercial
folk
in
past
days
well
what
are
you
going
to
ask
me
next
chapter
xiii
concerning
politics
said
i
how
do
you
manage
with
politics
said
hammond
smiling
i
am
glad
that
it
is
of
that
you
ask
that
question
i
do
believe
that
anybody
else
would
make
you
explain
yourself
or
try
to
do
so
till
you
were
sickened
of
asking
questions
indeed
i
believe
i
am
the
only
man
in
england
who
would
know
what
you
mean
and
since
i
know
i
will
answer
your
question
briefly
by
saying
that
we
are
very
well
off
as
to
politics
because
we
have
none
if
ever
you
make
a
book
out
of
this
conversation
put
this
in
a
chapter
by
itself
after
the
model
of
old
horrebow
snakes
in
iceland
i
will
said
i
chapter
xiv
how
matters
are
managed
said
i
how
about
your
relations
with
foreign
nations
i
will
not
affect
not
to
know
what
you
mean
said
he
but
i
will
tell
you
at
once
that
the
whole
system
of
rival
and
contending
nations
which
played
so
great
a
part
in
the
of
the
world
of
civilisation
has
disappeared
along
with
the
inequality
betwixt
man
and
man
in
society
does
not
that
make
the
world
duller
said
i
why
said
the
old
man
the
obliteration
of
national
variety
said
i
nonsense
he
said
somewhat
snappishly
cross
the
water
and
see
you
will
find
plenty
of
variety
the
landscape
the
building
the
diet
the
amusements
all
various
the
men
and
women
varying
in
looks
as
well
as
in
habits
of
thought
the
costume
far
more
various
than
in
the
commercial
period
how
should
it
add
to
the
variety
or
dispel
the
dulness
to
coerce
certain
families
or
tribes
often
heterogeneous
and
jarring
with
one
another
into
certain
artificial
and
mechanical
groups
and
call
them
nations
and
stimulate
their
patriotism
their
foolish
and
envious
prejudices
well
i
do
know
how
said
i
that
right
said
hammond
cheerily
you
can
easily
understand
that
now
we
are
freed
from
this
folly
it
is
obvious
to
us
that
by
means
of
this
very
diversity
the
different
strains
of
blood
in
the
world
can
be
serviceable
and
pleasant
to
each
other
without
in
the
least
wanting
to
rob
each
other
we
are
all
bent
on
the
same
enterprise
making
the
most
of
our
lives
and
i
must
tell
you
whatever
quarrels
or
misunderstandings
arise
they
very
seldom
take
place
between
people
of
different
race
and
consequently
since
there
is
less
unreason
in
them
they
are
the
more
readily
appeased
good
said
i
but
as
to
those
matters
of
politics
as
to
general
differences
of
opinion
in
one
and
the
same
community
do
you
assert
that
there
are
none
no
not
at
all
said
he
somewhat
snappishly
but
i
do
say
that
differences
of
opinion
about
real
solid
things
need
not
and
with
us
do
not
crystallise
people
into
parties
permanently
hostile
to
one
another
with
different
theories
as
to
the
build
of
the
universe
and
the
progress
of
time
is
that
what
politics
used
to
mean
h
well
said
i
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
said
he
i
take
you
neighbour
they
only
to
this
serious
difference
of
opinion
for
if
it
had
existed
they
could
not
have
dealt
together
in
the
ordinary
business
of
life
could
have
eaten
together
bought
and
sold
together
gambled
together
cheated
other
people
together
but
must
have
fought
whenever
they
met
which
would
not
have
suited
them
at
all
the
game
of
the
masters
of
politics
was
to
cajole
or
force
the
public
to
pay
the
expense
of
a
luxurious
life
and
exciting
amusement
for
a
few
cliques
of
ambitious
persons
and
the
of
serious
difference
of
opinion
belied
by
every
action
of
their
lives
was
quite
good
enough
for
that
what
has
all
that
got
to
do
with
us
said
i
why
nothing
i
should
hope
but
i
fear
in
short
i
have
been
told
that
political
strife
was
a
necessary
result
of
human
nature
human
nature
cried
the
old
boy
impetuously
what
human
nature
the
human
nature
of
paupers
of
slaves
of
or
the
human
nature
of
wealthy
freemen
which
come
tell
me
that
well
said
i
i
suppose
there
would
be
a
difference
according
to
circumstances
in
people
action
about
these
matters
i
should
think
so
indeed
said
he
at
all
events
experience
shows
that
it
is
so
amongst
us
our
differences
concern
matters
of
business
and
passing
events
as
to
them
and
could
not
divide
men
permanently
as
a
rule
the
immediate
outcome
shows
which
opinion
on
a
given
subject
is
the
right
one
it
is
a
matter
of
fact
not
of
speculation
for
instance
it
is
clearly
not
easy
to
knock
up
a
political
party
on
the
question
as
to
whether
haymaking
in
such
and
such
a
shall
begin
this
week
or
next
when
all
men
agree
that
it
must
at
latest
begin
the
week
after
next
and
when
any
man
can
go
down
into
the
fields
himself
and
see
whether
the
seeds
are
ripe
enough
for
the
cutting
said
i
and
you
settle
these
differences
great
and
small
by
the
will
of
the
majority
i
suppose
certainly
said
he
how
else
could
we
settle
them
you
see
in
matters
which
are
merely
personal
which
do
not
affect
the
welfare
of
the
community
how
a
man
shall
dress
what
he
shall
eat
and
drink
what
he
shall
write
and
read
and
so
forth
there
can
be
no
difference
of
opinion
and
everybody
does
as
he
pleases
but
when
the
matter
is
of
common
interest
to
the
whole
community
and
the
doing
or
not
doing
something
affects
everybody
the
majority
must
have
their
way
unless
the
minority
were
to
take
up
arms
and
show
by
force
that
they
were
the
effective
or
real
majority
which
however
in
a
society
of
men
who
are
free
and
equal
is
little
likely
to
happen
because
in
such
a
community
the
apparent
majority
the
real
majority
and
the
others
as
i
have
hinted
before
know
that
too
well
to
obstruct
from
mere
pigheadedness
especially
as
they
have
had
plenty
of
opportunity
of
putting
forward
their
side
of
the
question
how
is
that
managed
said
i
well
said
he
let
us
take
one
of
our
units
of
management
a
commune
or
a
ward
or
a
parish
for
we
have
all
three
names
indicating
little
real
distinction
between
them
now
though
time
was
there
was
a
good
deal
in
such
a
district
as
you
would
call
it
some
neighbours
think
that
something
ought
to
be
done
or
undone
a
new
built
a
clearance
of
inconvenient
houses
or
say
a
stone
bridge
substituted
for
some
ugly
old
iron
one
there
you
have
undoing
and
doing
in
one
well
at
the
next
ordinary
meeting
of
the
neighbours
or
mote
as
we
call
it
according
to
the
ancient
tongue
of
the
times
before
bureaucracy
a
neighbour
proposes
the
change
and
of
course
if
everybody
agrees
there
is
an
end
of
discussion
except
about
details
equally
if
no
one
backs
the
proposer
him
it
used
to
be
called
the
matter
drops
for
the
time
being
a
thing
not
likely
to
happen
amongst
reasonable
men
however
as
the
proposer
is
sure
to
have
talked
it
over
with
others
before
the
mote
but
supposing
the
affair
proposed
and
seconded
if
a
few
of
the
neighbours
disagree
to
it
if
they
think
that
the
beastly
iron
bridge
will
serve
a
little
longer
and
they
do
want
to
be
bothered
with
building
a
new
one
just
then
they
do
count
heads
that
time
but
put
off
the
formal
discussion
to
the
next
mote
and
meantime
arguments
and
are
flying
about
and
some
get
printed
so
that
everybody
knows
what
is
going
on
and
when
the
mote
comes
together
again
there
is
a
regular
discussion
and
at
last
a
vote
by
show
of
hands
if
the
division
is
a
close
one
the
question
is
again
put
off
for
further
discussion
if
the
division
is
a
wide
one
the
minority
are
asked
if
they
will
yield
to
the
more
general
opinion
which
they
often
nay
most
commonly
do
if
they
refuse
the
question
is
debated
a
third
time
when
if
the
minority
has
not
perceptibly
grown
they
always
give
way
though
i
believe
there
is
some
rule
by
which
they
might
still
carry
it
on
further
but
i
say
what
always
happens
is
that
they
are
convinced
not
perhaps
that
their
view
is
the
wrong
one
but
they
can
not
persuade
or
force
the
community
to
adopt
it
very
good
said
i
but
what
happens
if
the
divisions
are
still
narrow
said
he
as
a
matter
of
principle
and
according
to
the
rule
of
such
cases
the
question
must
then
lapse
and
the
majority
if
so
narrow
has
to
submit
to
sitting
down
under
the
but
i
must
tell
you
that
in
point
of
fact
the
minority
very
seldom
enforces
this
rule
but
generally
yields
in
a
friendly
manner
but
do
you
know
said
i
that
there
is
something
in
all
this
very
like
democracy
and
i
thought
that
democracy
was
considered
to
be
in
a
moribund
condition
many
many
years
ago
the
old
boy
eyes
twinkled
i
grant
you
that
our
methods
have
that
drawback
but
what
is
to
be
done
we
ca
get
amongst
us
to
complain
of
his
not
always
having
his
own
way
in
the
teeth
of
the
community
when
it
is
clear
that
can
not
have
that
indulgence
what
is
to
be
done
well
said
i
i
do
know
said
he
the
only
alternatives
to
our
method
that
i
can
conceive
of
are
these
first
that
we
should
choose
out
or
breed
a
class
of
superior
persons
capable
of
judging
on
all
matters
without
consulting
the
neighbours
that
in
short
we
should
get
for
ourselves
what
used
to
be
called
an
aristocracy
of
intellect
or
secondly
that
for
the
purpose
of
the
freedom
of
the
individual
will
we
should
revert
to
a
system
of
private
property
again
and
have
slaves
and
once
more
what
do
you
think
of
those
two
expedients
well
said
i
there
is
a
third
possibility
to
wit
that
every
man
should
be
quite
independent
of
every
other
and
that
thus
the
tyranny
of
society
should
be
abolished
he
looked
hard
at
me
for
a
second
or
two
and
then
burst
out
laughing
very
heartily
and
i
confess
that
i
joined
him
when
he
recovered
himself
he
nodded
at
me
and
said
yes
yes
i
quite
agree
with
you
and
so
we
all
do
yes
i
said
and
besides
it
does
not
press
hardly
on
the
minority
for
take
this
matter
of
the
bridge
no
man
is
obliged
to
work
on
it
if
he
does
agree
to
its
building
at
least
i
suppose
not
he
smiled
and
said
shrewdly
put
and
yet
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
native
of
another
planet
if
the
man
of
the
minority
does
find
his
feelings
hurt
doubtless
he
may
relieve
them
by
refusing
to
help
in
building
the
bridge
but
dear
neighbour
that
is
not
a
very
effective
salve
for
the
wound
caused
by
the
of
a
majority
in
our
society
because
all
work
that
is
done
is
either
beneficial
or
hurtful
to
every
member
of
society
the
man
is
benefited
by
the
if
it
turns
out
a
good
thing
and
hurt
by
it
if
it
turns
out
a
bad
one
whether
he
puts
a
hand
to
it
or
not
and
meanwhile
he
is
benefiting
the
builders
by
his
work
whatever
that
may
be
in
fact
i
see
no
help
for
him
except
the
pleasure
of
saying
told
you
so
if
the
turns
out
to
be
a
mistake
and
hurts
him
if
it
benefits
him
he
must
suffer
in
silence
a
terrible
tyranny
our
communism
is
it
not
folk
used
often
to
be
warned
against
this
very
unhappiness
in
times
past
when
for
every
contented
person
you
saw
a
thousand
miserable
starvelings
whereas
for
us
we
grow
fat
and
on
the
tyranny
a
tyranny
to
say
the
truth
not
to
be
made
visible
by
any
microscope
i
know
do
be
afraid
my
friend
we
are
not
going
to
seek
for
troubles
by
calling
our
peace
and
plenty
and
happiness
by
ill
names
whose
very
meaning
we
have
forgotten
he
sat
musing
for
a
little
and
then
started
and
said
are
there
any
more
questions
dear
guest
the
morning
is
waning
fast
amidst
my
garrulity
chapter
xv
on
the
lack
of
incentive
to
labour
in
a
communist
society
yes
said
i
i
was
expecting
dick
and
clara
to
make
their
appearance
any
moment
but
is
there
time
to
ask
just
one
or
two
questions
before
they
come
try
it
dear
neighbour
try
it
said
old
hammond
for
the
more
you
ask
me
the
better
i
am
pleased
and
at
any
rate
if
they
do
come
and
find
me
in
the
middle
of
an
answer
they
must
sit
quiet
and
pretend
to
listen
till
i
come
to
an
end
it
wo
hurt
them
they
will
find
it
quite
amusing
enough
to
sit
side
by
side
conscious
of
their
proximity
to
each
other
i
smiled
as
i
was
bound
to
and
said
good
i
will
go
on
talking
without
noticing
them
when
they
come
in
now
this
is
what
i
want
to
ask
you
about
to
wit
how
you
get
people
to
work
when
there
is
no
reward
of
labour
and
especially
how
you
get
them
to
work
strenuously
no
reward
of
labour
said
hammond
gravely
the
reward
of
labour
is
is
that
not
enough
but
no
reward
for
especially
good
work
quoth
i
plenty
of
reward
said
he
the
reward
of
creation
the
wages
which
god
gets
as
people
might
have
said
time
agone
if
you
are
going
to
ask
to
be
paid
for
the
pleasure
of
creation
which
is
what
excellence
in
work
means
the
next
thing
we
shall
hear
of
will
be
a
bill
sent
in
for
the
begetting
of
children
well
but
said
i
the
man
of
the
nineteenth
century
would
say
there
is
a
natural
desire
towards
the
procreation
of
children
and
a
natural
desire
not
to
work
yes
yes
said
he
i
know
the
ancient
platitude
wholly
untrue
indeed
to
us
quite
meaningless
fourier
whom
all
men
laughed
at
understood
the
matter
better
why
is
it
meaningless
to
you
said
i
he
said
because
it
implies
that
all
work
is
suffering
and
we
are
so
far
from
thinking
that
that
as
you
may
have
noticed
whereas
we
are
not
short
of
wealth
there
is
a
kind
of
fear
growing
up
amongst
us
that
we
shall
one
day
be
short
of
work
it
is
a
pleasure
which
we
are
afraid
of
losing
not
a
pain
yes
said
i
i
have
noticed
that
and
i
was
going
to
ask
you
about
that
also
but
in
the
meantime
what
do
you
positively
mean
to
assert
about
the
pleasurableness
of
work
amongst
you
this
that
work
is
now
pleasurable
either
because
of
the
hope
of
gain
in
honour
and
wealth
with
which
the
work
is
done
which
causes
pleasurable
excitement
even
when
the
actual
work
is
not
pleasant
or
else
because
it
has
grown
into
a
pleasurable
as
in
the
case
with
what
you
may
call
mechanical
work
and
lastly
and
most
of
our
work
is
of
this
kind
because
there
is
conscious
sensuous
pleasure
in
the
work
itself
it
is
done
that
is
by
artists
i
see
said
i
can
you
now
tell
me
how
you
have
come
to
this
happy
condition
for
to
speak
plainly
this
change
from
the
conditions
of
the
older
world
seems
to
me
far
greater
and
more
important
than
all
the
other
changes
you
have
told
me
about
as
to
crime
politics
property
marriage
you
are
right
there
said
he
indeed
you
may
say
rather
that
it
is
this
change
which
makes
all
the
others
possible
what
is
the
object
of
revolution
surely
to
make
people
happy
revolution
having
brought
its
foredoomed
change
about
how
can
you
prevent
the
from
setting
in
except
by
making
people
happy
what
shall
we
expect
peace
and
stability
from
unhappiness
the
gathering
of
grapes
from
thorns
and
figs
from
thistles
is
a
reasonable
expectation
compared
with
that
and
happiness
without
happy
daily
work
is
impossible
most
obviously
true
said
i
for
i
thought
the
old
boy
was
preaching
a
little
but
answer
my
question
as
to
how
you
gained
this
happiness
briefly
said
he
by
the
absence
of
artificial
coercion
and
the
freedom
for
every
man
to
do
what
he
can
do
best
joined
to
the
knowledge
of
what
productions
of
labour
we
really
wanted
i
must
admit
that
this
knowledge
we
reached
slowly
and
painfully
go
on
said
i
give
me
more
detail
explain
more
fully
for
this
subject
interests
me
intensely
yes
i
will
said
he
but
in
order
to
do
so
i
must
weary
you
by
talking
a
little
about
the
past
contrast
is
necessary
for
this
explanation
do
you
mind
no
no
said
i
said
he
settling
himself
in
his
chair
again
for
a
long
talk
it
is
clear
from
all
that
we
hear
and
read
that
in
the
last
age
of
civilisation
men
had
got
into
a
vicious
circle
in
the
matter
of
production
of
wares
they
had
reached
a
wonderful
facility
of
production
and
in
order
to
make
the
most
of
that
facility
they
had
gradually
created
or
allowed
to
grow
rather
a
most
elaborate
system
of
buying
and
selling
which
has
been
called
the
and
that
once
set
forced
them
to
go
on
making
more
and
more
of
these
wares
whether
they
needed
them
or
not
so
that
while
of
course
they
could
not
free
themselves
from
the
toil
of
making
real
necessaries
they
created
in
a
series
sham
or
artificial
necessaries
which
became
under
the
iron
rule
of
the
aforesaid
market
of
equal
importance
to
them
with
the
real
necessaries
which
supported
life
by
all
this
they
burdened
themselves
with
a
prodigious
mass
of
work
merely
for
the
sake
of
keeping
their
wretched
system
going
yes
and
then
said
i
why
then
since
they
had
forced
themselves
to
stagger
along
under
this
horrible
burden
of
unnecessary
production
it
became
impossible
for
them
to
look
upon
labour
and
its
results
from
any
other
point
of
view
than
one
to
wit
the
ceaseless
endeavour
to
expend
the
least
possible
amount
of
labour
on
any
article
made
and
yet
at
the
same
time
to
make
as
many
articles
as
possible
to
this
of
production
as
it
was
called
everything
was
sacrificed
the
happiness
of
the
workman
at
his
work
nay
his
most
elementary
comfort
and
bare
health
his
food
his
clothes
his
dwelling
his
leisure
his
amusement
his
education
his
life
in
short
did
not
weigh
a
grain
of
sand
in
the
balance
against
this
dire
necessity
of
production
of
things
a
great
part
of
which
were
not
worth
producing
at
all
nay
we
are
told
and
we
must
believe
it
so
overwhelming
is
the
evidence
though
many
of
our
people
scarcely
believe
it
that
even
rich
and
powerful
men
the
masters
of
the
poor
devils
aforesaid
submitted
to
live
amidst
sights
and
sounds
and
smells
which
it
is
in
the
very
nature
of
man
to
abhor
and
flee
from
in
order
that
their
riches
might
bolster
up
this
supreme
folly
the
whole
community
in
fact
was
cast
into
the
jaws
of
this
ravening
monster
cheap
production
forced
upon
it
by
the
dear
me
said
i
but
what
happened
did
not
their
cleverness
and
facility
in
production
master
this
chaos
of
misery
at
last
they
catch
up
with
the
and
then
set
to
work
to
devise
means
for
relieving
themselves
from
this
fearful
task
of
extra
labour
he
smiled
bitterly
did
they
even
try
to
said
he
i
am
not
sure
you
know
that
according
to
the
old
saw
the
beetle
gets
used
to
living
in
dung
and
these
people
whether
they
found
the
dung
sweet
or
not
certainly
lived
in
it
his
estimate
of
the
life
of
the
nineteenth
century
made
me
catch
my
breath
a
little
and
i
said
feebly
but
the
machines
heyday
quoth
he
what
that
you
are
saying
the
machines
yes
they
were
made
to
labour
or
to
speak
more
plainly
the
lives
of
men
on
one
piece
of
work
in
order
that
it
might
be
expended
i
will
say
wasted
on
another
probably
useless
piece
of
work
friend
all
their
devices
for
cheapening
labour
simply
resulted
in
increasing
the
burden
of
labour
the
appetite
of
the
grew
with
what
it
fed
on
the
countries
within
the
ring
of
that
is
organised
misery
were
glutted
with
the
abortions
of
the
market
and
force
and
fraud
were
used
unsparingly
to
up
countries
that
pale
this
process
of
up
is
a
strange
one
to
those
who
have
read
the
professions
of
the
men
of
that
period
and
do
not
understand
their
practice
and
perhaps
shows
us
at
its
worst
the
great
vice
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
use
of
hypocrisy
and
cant
to
evade
the
responsibility
of
vicarious
ferocity
when
the
civilised
coveted
a
country
not
yet
in
its
clutches
some
transparent
pretext
was
found
the
suppression
of
a
slavery
different
from
and
not
so
cruel
as
that
of
commerce
the
pushing
of
a
religion
no
longer
believed
in
by
its
promoters
the
of
some
desperado
or
homicidal
madman
whose
misdeeds
had
got
him
into
trouble
amongst
the
natives
of
the
country
any
stick
in
short
which
would
beat
the
dog
at
all
then
some
bold
unprincipled
ignorant
adventurer
was
found
no
difficult
task
in
the
days
of
competition
and
he
was
bribed
to
a
market
by
breaking
up
whatever
traditional
society
there
might
be
in
the
doomed
country
and
by
destroying
whatever
leisure
or
pleasure
he
found
there
he
forced
wares
on
the
natives
which
they
did
not
want
and
took
their
natural
products
in
as
this
form
of
robbery
was
called
and
thereby
he
new
wants
to
supply
which
that
is
to
be
allowed
to
live
by
their
new
masters
the
hapless
helpless
people
had
to
sell
themselves
into
the
slavery
of
hopeless
toil
so
that
they
might
have
something
wherewith
to
purchase
the
nullities
of
ah
said
the
old
man
pointing
to
the
museum
i
have
read
books
and
papers
in
there
telling
strange
stories
indeed
of
the
dealings
of
civilisation
or
organised
misery
with
from
the
time
when
the
british
government
deliberately
sent
blankets
infected
with
as
choice
gifts
to
inconvenient
tribes
of
to
the
time
when
africa
was
infested
by
a
man
named
stanley
who
excuse
me
said
i
but
as
you
know
time
presses
and
i
want
to
keep
our
question
on
the
straightest
line
possible
and
i
want
at
once
to
ask
this
about
these
wares
made
for
the
how
about
their
quality
these
people
who
were
so
clever
about
making
goods
i
suppose
they
made
them
well
quality
said
the
old
man
crustily
for
he
was
rather
peevish
at
being
cut
short
in
his
story
how
could
they
possibly
attend
to
such
trifles
as
the
quality
of
the
wares
they
sold
the
best
of
them
were
of
a
lowish
average
the
worst
were
transparent
for
the
things
asked
for
which
nobody
would
have
put
up
with
if
they
could
have
got
anything
else
it
was
a
current
jest
of
the
time
that
the
wares
were
made
to
sell
and
not
to
use
a
jest
which
you
as
coming
from
another
planet
may
understand
but
which
our
folk
could
not
said
i
what
did
they
make
nothing
well
why
yes
said
he
there
was
one
class
of
goods
which
they
did
make
thoroughly
well
and
that
was
the
class
of
machines
which
were
used
for
making
things
these
were
usually
quite
perfect
pieces
of
workmanship
admirably
adapted
to
the
end
in
view
so
that
it
may
be
fairly
said
that
the
great
achievement
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
the
making
of
machines
which
were
wonders
of
invention
skill
and
patience
and
which
were
used
for
the
production
of
measureless
quantities
of
worthless
shifts
in
truth
the
owners
of
the
machines
did
not
consider
anything
which
they
made
as
wares
but
simply
as
means
for
the
enrichment
of
themselves
of
course
the
only
admitted
test
of
utility
in
wares
was
the
finding
of
buyers
for
them
wise
men
or
fools
as
it
might
chance
and
people
put
up
with
this
said
i
for
a
time
said
he
and
then
and
then
the
overturn
said
the
old
man
smiling
and
the
nineteenth
century
saw
itself
as
a
man
who
has
lost
his
clothes
whilst
bathing
and
has
to
walk
naked
through
the
town
you
are
very
bitter
about
that
unlucky
nineteenth
century
said
i
naturally
said
he
since
i
know
so
much
about
it
he
was
silent
a
little
and
then
said
there
are
traditions
nay
real
histories
in
our
family
about
it
my
grandfather
was
one
of
its
victims
if
you
know
something
about
it
you
will
understand
what
he
suffered
when
i
tell
you
that
he
was
in
those
days
a
genuine
artist
a
man
of
genius
and
a
revolutionist
i
think
i
do
understand
said
i
but
now
as
it
seems
you
have
reversed
all
this
pretty
much
so
said
he
the
wares
which
we
make
are
made
because
they
are
needed
men
make
for
their
neighbours
use
as
if
they
were
making
for
themselves
not
for
a
vague
market
of
which
they
know
nothing
and
over
which
they
have
no
control
as
there
is
no
buying
and
selling
it
would
be
mere
insanity
to
make
goods
on
the
chance
of
their
being
wanted
for
there
is
no
longer
anyone
who
can
be
compelled
to
buy
them
so
that
whatever
is
made
is
good
and
thoroughly
fit
for
its
purpose
nothing
can
be
made
except
for
genuine
use
therefore
no
inferior
goods
are
made
moreover
as
aforesaid
we
have
now
found
out
what
we
want
so
we
make
no
more
than
we
want
and
as
we
are
not
driven
to
make
a
vast
quantity
of
useless
things
we
have
time
and
resources
enough
to
consider
our
pleasure
in
making
them
all
work
which
would
be
irksome
to
do
by
hand
is
done
by
immensely
improved
machinery
and
in
all
work
which
it
is
a
pleasure
to
do
by
hand
machinery
is
done
without
there
is
no
difficulty
in
finding
work
which
suits
the
special
turn
of
mind
of
everybody
so
that
no
man
is
sacrificed
to
the
wants
of
another
from
time
to
time
when
we
have
found
out
that
some
piece
of
work
was
too
disagreeable
or
troublesome
we
have
given
it
up
and
done
altogether
without
the
thing
produced
by
it
now
surely
you
can
see
that
under
these
circumstances
all
the
work
that
we
do
is
an
exercise
of
the
mind
and
body
more
or
less
pleasant
to
be
done
so
that
instead
of
avoiding
work
everybody
seeks
it
and
since
people
have
got
defter
in
doing
the
work
generation
after
generation
it
has
become
so
easy
to
do
that
it
seems
as
if
there
were
less
done
though
probably
more
is
produced
i
suppose
this
explains
that
fear
which
i
hinted
at
just
now
of
a
possible
scarcity
in
work
which
perhaps
you
have
already
noticed
and
which
is
a
feeling
on
the
increase
and
has
been
for
a
score
of
years
but
do
you
think
said
i
that
there
is
any
fear
of
a
amongst
you
no
i
do
not
said
he
and
i
will
tell
why
it
is
each
man
business
to
make
his
own
work
pleasanter
and
pleasanter
which
of
course
tends
towards
raising
the
standard
of
excellence
as
no
man
enjoys
turning
out
work
which
is
not
a
credit
to
him
and
also
to
greater
deliberation
in
turning
it
out
and
there
is
such
a
vast
number
of
things
which
can
be
treated
as
works
of
art
that
this
alone
gives
employment
to
a
host
of
deft
people
again
if
art
be
inexhaustible
so
is
science
also
and
though
it
is
no
longer
the
only
innocent
occupation
which
is
thought
worth
an
intelligent
man
spending
his
time
upon
as
it
once
was
yet
there
are
and
i
suppose
will
be
many
people
who
are
excited
by
its
conquest
of
difficulties
and
care
for
it
more
than
for
anything
else
again
as
more
and
more
of
pleasure
is
imported
into
work
i
think
we
shall
take
up
kinds
of
work
which
produce
desirable
wares
but
which
we
gave
up
because
we
could
not
carry
them
on
pleasantly
moreover
i
think
that
it
is
only
in
parts
of
europe
which
are
more
advanced
than
the
rest
of
the
world
that
you
will
hear
this
talk
of
the
fear
of
a
those
lands
which
were
once
the
colonies
of
great
britain
for
instance
and
especially
america
that
part
of
it
above
all
which
was
once
the
united
states
are
now
and
will
be
for
a
long
while
a
great
resource
to
us
for
these
lands
and
i
say
especially
the
northern
parts
of
america
suffered
so
terribly
from
the
full
force
of
the
last
days
of
civilisation
and
became
such
horrible
places
to
live
in
that
they
are
now
very
backward
in
all
that
makes
life
pleasant
indeed
one
may
say
that
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
the
people
of
the
northern
parts
of
america
have
been
engaged
in
gradually
making
a
out
of
a
stinking
and
there
is
still
a
great
deal
to
do
especially
as
the
country
is
so
big
well
said
i
i
am
exceedingly
glad
to
think
that
you
have
such
a
prospect
of
happiness
before
you
but
i
should
like
to
ask
a
few
more
questions
and
then
i
have
done
for
chapter
xvi
dinner
in
the
hall
of
the
bloomsbury
market
as
i
spoke
i
heard
footsteps
near
the
door
the
latch
yielded
and
in
came
our
two
lovers
looking
so
handsome
that
one
had
no
feeling
of
shame
in
looking
on
at
their
for
indeed
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
world
must
be
in
love
with
them
as
for
old
hammond
he
looked
on
them
like
an
artist
who
has
just
painted
a
picture
nearly
as
well
as
he
thought
he
could
when
he
began
it
and
was
perfectly
happy
he
said
sit
down
sit
down
young
folk
and
do
make
a
noise
our
guest
here
has
still
some
questions
to
ask
me
well
i
should
suppose
so
said
dick
you
have
only
been
three
hours
and
a
half
together
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
history
of
two
centuries
could
be
told
in
three
hours
and
a
half
let
alone
that
for
all
i
know
you
may
have
been
wandering
into
the
realms
of
geography
and
craftsmanship
as
to
noise
my
dear
kinsman
said
clara
you
will
very
soon
be
disturbed
by
the
noise
of
the
which
i
should
think
will
be
very
pleasant
music
to
our
guest
who
breakfasted
early
it
seems
and
probably
had
a
tiring
day
yesterday
i
said
well
since
you
have
spoken
the
word
i
begin
to
feel
that
it
is
so
but
i
have
been
feeding
myself
with
wonder
this
long
time
past
really
it
quite
true
quoth
i
as
i
saw
her
smile
o
so
prettily
but
just
then
from
some
tower
high
up
in
the
air
came
the
sound
of
silvery
chimes
playing
a
sweet
clear
tune
that
sounded
to
my
unaccustomed
ears
like
the
song
of
the
first
blackbird
in
the
spring
and
called
a
rush
of
memories
to
my
mind
some
of
bad
times
some
of
good
but
all
sweetened
now
into
mere
pleasure
no
more
questions
now
before
dinner
said
clara
and
she
took
my
hand
as
an
affectionate
child
would
and
led
me
out
of
the
room
and
down
stairs
into
the
forecourt
of
the
museum
leaving
the
two
hammonds
to
follow
as
they
pleased
we
went
into
the
which
i
had
been
in
before
a
thinnish
stream
of
elegantly
dressed
people
going
in
along
with
us
we
turned
into
the
cloister
and
came
to
a
richly
moulded
and
carved
doorway
where
a
very
pretty
young
girl
gave
us
each
a
beautiful
bunch
of
summer
flowers
and
we
entered
a
hall
much
bigger
than
that
of
the
hammersmith
guest
house
more
elaborate
in
its
architecture
and
perhaps
more
beautiful
i
found
it
difficult
to
keep
my
eyes
off
the
for
i
thought
it
bad
manners
to
stare
at
clara
all
the
time
though
she
was
quite
worth
it
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
their
subjects
were
taken
from
queer
myths
and
imaginations
which
in
yesterday
world
only
about
half
a
dozen
people
in
the
country
knew
anything
about
and
when
the
two
hammonds
sat
down
opposite
to
us
i
said
to
the
old
man
pointing
to
the
frieze
how
strange
to
see
such
subjects
here
why
said
he
i
do
see
why
you
should
be
surprised
everybody
knows
the
tales
and
they
are
graceful
and
pleasant
subjects
not
too
tragic
for
a
place
where
people
mostly
eat
and
drink
and
amuse
themselves
and
yet
full
of
incident
i
smiled
and
said
well
i
scarcely
expected
to
find
record
of
the
seven
swans
and
the
king
of
the
golden
mountain
and
faithful
henry
and
such
curious
pleasant
imaginations
as
jacob
grimm
got
together
from
the
childhood
of
the
world
barely
lingering
even
in
his
time
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
forgotten
such
childishness
by
this
time
the
old
man
smiled
and
said
nothing
but
dick
turned
rather
red
and
broke
out
what
you
mean
guest
i
think
them
very
beautiful
i
mean
not
only
the
pictures
but
the
stories
and
when
we
were
children
we
used
to
imagine
them
going
on
in
every
by
the
bight
of
every
stream
every
house
in
the
fields
was
the
fairyland
king
house
to
us
you
remember
clara
yes
she
said
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
a
slight
cloud
came
over
her
fair
face
i
was
going
to
speak
to
her
on
the
subject
when
the
pretty
waitresses
came
to
us
smiling
and
chattering
sweetly
like
reed
warblers
by
the
river
side
and
fell
to
giving
us
our
dinner
as
to
this
as
at
our
breakfast
everything
was
cooked
and
served
with
a
daintiness
which
showed
that
those
who
had
prepared
it
were
interested
in
it
but
there
was
no
excess
either
of
quantity
or
of
gourmandise
everything
was
simple
though
so
excellent
of
its
kind
and
it
was
made
clear
to
us
that
this
was
no
feast
only
an
ordinary
meal
the
glass
crockery
and
plate
were
very
beautiful
to
my
eyes
used
to
the
study
of
mediaeval
art
but
a
would
i
daresay
have
found
them
rough
and
lacking
in
finish
the
crockery
being
though
beautifully
ornamented
the
only
porcelain
being
here
and
there
a
piece
of
old
oriental
ware
the
glass
again
though
elegant
and
quaint
and
very
varied
in
form
was
somewhat
bubbled
and
hornier
in
texture
than
the
commercial
articles
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
furniture
and
general
fittings
of
the
hall
were
much
of
a
piece
with
the
beautiful
in
form
and
highly
ornamented
but
without
the
commercial
finish
of
the
joiners
and
of
our
time
withal
there
was
a
total
absence
of
what
the
nineteenth
century
calls
comfort
that
is
stuffy
inconvenience
so
that
even
apart
from
the
delightful
excitement
of
the
day
i
had
never
eaten
my
dinner
so
pleasantly
before
when
we
had
done
eating
and
were
sitting
a
little
while
with
a
bottle
of
very
good
bordeaux
wine
before
us
clara
came
back
to
the
question
of
the
of
the
pictures
as
though
it
had
troubled
her
she
looked
up
at
them
and
said
how
is
it
that
though
we
are
so
interested
with
our
life
for
the
most
part
yet
when
people
take
to
writing
poems
or
painting
pictures
they
seldom
deal
with
our
modern
life
or
if
they
do
take
good
care
to
make
their
poems
or
pictures
unlike
that
life
are
we
not
good
enough
to
paint
ourselves
how
is
it
that
we
find
the
dreadful
times
of
the
past
so
interesting
to
us
in
pictures
and
poetry
old
hammond
smiled
it
always
was
so
and
i
suppose
always
will
be
said
he
however
it
may
be
explained
it
is
true
that
in
the
nineteenth
century
when
there
was
so
little
art
and
so
much
talk
about
it
there
was
a
theory
that
art
and
imaginative
literature
ought
to
deal
with
contemporary
life
but
they
never
did
so
for
if
there
was
any
pretence
of
it
the
author
always
took
care
as
clara
hinted
just
now
to
disguise
or
exaggerate
or
idealise
and
in
some
way
or
another
make
it
strange
so
that
for
all
the
verisimilitude
there
was
he
might
just
as
well
have
dealt
with
the
times
of
the
pharaohs
well
said
dick
surely
it
is
but
natural
to
like
these
things
strange
just
as
when
we
were
children
as
i
said
just
now
we
used
to
pretend
to
be
in
a
place
that
what
these
pictures
and
poems
do
and
why
should
they
thou
hast
hit
it
dick
quoth
old
hammond
it
is
the
part
of
us
that
produces
works
of
imagination
when
we
are
children
time
passes
so
slow
with
us
that
we
seem
to
have
time
for
everything
he
sighed
and
then
smiled
and
said
at
least
let
us
rejoice
that
we
have
got
back
our
childhood
again
i
drink
to
the
days
that
are
second
childhood
said
i
in
a
low
voice
and
then
blushed
at
my
double
rudeness
and
hoped
that
he
had
heard
but
he
had
and
turned
to
me
smiling
and
said
yes
why
not
and
for
my
part
i
hope
it
may
last
long
and
that
the
world
next
period
of
wise
and
unhappy
manhood
if
that
should
happen
will
speedily
lead
us
to
a
third
childhood
if
indeed
this
age
be
not
our
third
meantime
my
friend
you
must
know
that
we
are
too
happy
both
individually
and
collectively
to
trouble
ourselves
about
what
is
to
come
hereafter
well
for
my
part
said
clara
i
wish
we
were
interesting
enough
to
be
written
or
painted
about
dick
answered
her
with
some
lover
speech
impossible
to
be
written
down
and
then
we
sat
quiet
a
little
chapter
xvii
how
the
change
came
dick
broke
the
silence
at
last
saying
guest
forgive
us
for
a
little
dulness
what
would
you
like
to
do
shall
we
have
out
greylocks
and
trot
back
to
hammersmith
or
will
you
come
with
us
and
hear
some
welsh
folk
sing
in
a
hall
close
by
here
or
would
you
like
presently
to
come
with
me
into
the
city
and
see
some
really
fine
building
or
what
shall
it
be
well
said
i
as
i
am
a
stranger
i
must
let
you
choose
for
me
in
point
of
fact
i
did
not
by
any
means
want
to
be
just
then
and
also
i
rather
felt
as
if
the
old
man
with
his
knowledge
of
past
times
and
even
a
kind
of
inverted
sympathy
for
them
caused
by
his
active
hatred
of
them
was
as
it
were
a
blanket
for
me
against
the
cold
of
this
very
new
world
where
i
was
so
to
say
stripped
bare
of
every
habitual
thought
and
way
of
acting
and
i
did
not
want
to
leave
him
too
soon
he
came
to
my
rescue
at
once
and
said
wait
a
bit
dick
there
is
someone
else
to
be
consulted
besides
you
and
the
guest
here
and
that
is
i
am
not
going
to
lose
the
pleasure
of
his
company
just
now
especially
as
i
know
he
has
something
else
to
ask
me
so
go
to
your
welshmen
by
all
means
but
first
of
all
bring
us
another
bottle
of
wine
to
this
nook
and
then
be
off
as
soon
as
you
like
and
come
again
and
fetch
our
friend
to
go
westward
but
not
too
soon
dick
nodded
smilingly
and
the
old
man
and
i
were
soon
alone
in
the
great
hall
the
afternoon
sun
gleaming
on
the
red
wine
in
our
tall
glasses
then
said
hammond
does
anything
especially
puzzle
you
about
our
way
of
living
now
you
have
heard
a
good
deal
and
seen
a
little
of
it
said
i
i
think
what
puzzles
me
most
is
how
it
all
came
about
it
well
may
said
he
so
great
as
the
change
is
it
would
be
difficult
indeed
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
perhaps
impossible
knowledge
discontent
treachery
disappointment
ruin
misery
despair
those
who
worked
for
the
change
because
they
could
see
further
than
other
people
went
through
all
these
phases
of
suffering
and
doubtless
all
the
time
the
most
of
men
looked
on
not
knowing
what
was
doing
thinking
it
all
a
matter
of
course
like
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
and
indeed
it
was
so
tell
me
one
thing
if
you
can
said
i
did
the
change
the
it
used
to
be
called
come
peacefully
peacefully
said
he
what
peace
was
there
amongst
those
poor
confused
wretches
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
was
war
from
beginning
to
end
bitter
war
till
hope
and
pleasure
put
an
end
to
it
do
you
mean
actual
fighting
with
weapons
said
i
or
the
strikes
and
and
starvation
of
which
we
have
heard
both
both
he
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
history
of
the
terrible
period
of
transition
from
commercial
slavery
to
freedom
may
thus
be
summarised
when
the
hope
of
realising
a
communal
condition
of
life
for
all
men
arose
quite
late
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
power
of
the
middle
classes
the
then
tyrants
of
society
was
so
enormous
and
crushing
that
to
almost
all
men
even
those
who
had
you
may
say
despite
themselves
despite
their
reason
and
judgment
conceived
such
hopes
it
seemed
a
dream
so
much
was
this
the
case
that
some
of
those
more
enlightened
men
who
were
then
called
socialists
although
they
well
knew
and
even
stated
in
public
that
the
only
reasonable
condition
of
society
was
that
of
pure
communism
such
as
you
now
see
around
you
yet
shrunk
from
what
seemed
to
them
the
barren
task
of
preaching
the
realisation
of
a
happy
dream
looking
back
now
we
can
see
that
the
great
of
the
change
was
a
longing
for
freedom
and
equality
akin
if
you
please
to
the
unreasonable
passion
of
the
lover
a
sickness
of
heart
that
rejected
with
loathing
the
aimless
solitary
life
of
the
educated
man
of
that
time
phrases
my
dear
friend
which
have
lost
their
meaning
to
us
of
the
present
day
so
far
removed
we
are
from
the
dreadful
facts
which
they
represent
well
these
men
though
conscious
of
this
feeling
had
no
faith
in
it
as
a
means
of
bringing
about
the
change
nor
was
that
wonderful
for
looking
around
them
they
saw
the
huge
mass
of
the
oppressed
classes
too
much
burdened
with
the
misery
of
their
lives
and
too
much
overwhelmed
by
the
selfishness
of
misery
to
be
able
to
form
a
conception
of
any
escape
from
it
except
by
the
ordinary
way
prescribed
by
the
system
of
slavery
under
which
they
lived
which
was
nothing
more
than
a
remote
chance
of
climbing
out
of
the
oppressed
into
the
oppressing
class
therefore
though
they
knew
that
the
only
reasonable
aim
for
those
who
would
better
the
world
was
a
condition
of
equality
in
their
impatience
and
despair
they
managed
to
convince
themselves
that
if
they
could
by
hook
or
by
crook
get
the
machinery
of
production
and
the
management
of
property
so
altered
that
the
classes
so
the
horrible
word
ran
might
have
their
slavery
somewhat
ameliorated
they
would
be
ready
to
fit
into
this
machinery
and
would
use
it
for
bettering
their
condition
still
more
and
still
more
until
at
last
the
result
would
be
a
practical
equality
they
were
very
fond
of
using
the
word
because
rich
would
be
forced
to
pay
so
much
for
keeping
poor
in
a
tolerable
condition
that
the
condition
of
riches
would
become
no
longer
valuable
and
would
gradually
die
out
do
you
follow
me
partly
said
i
go
on
said
old
hammond
well
since
you
follow
me
you
will
see
that
as
a
theory
this
was
not
altogether
unreasonable
but
it
turned
out
a
failure
how
so
said
i
well
do
you
see
said
he
because
it
involved
the
making
of
a
machinery
by
those
who
did
know
what
they
wanted
the
machines
to
do
so
far
as
the
masses
of
the
oppressed
class
furthered
this
scheme
of
improvement
they
did
it
to
get
themselves
improved
as
many
of
them
as
could
and
if
those
classes
had
really
been
incapable
of
being
touched
by
that
instinct
which
produced
the
passion
for
freedom
and
equality
aforesaid
what
would
have
happened
i
think
would
have
been
this
that
a
certain
part
of
the
working
classes
would
have
been
so
far
improved
in
condition
that
they
would
have
approached
the
condition
of
the
middling
rich
men
but
below
them
would
have
been
a
great
class
of
most
miserable
slaves
whose
slavery
would
have
been
far
more
hopeless
than
the
older
had
been
what
stood
in
the
way
of
this
said
i
why
of
course
said
he
just
that
instinct
for
freedom
aforesaid
it
is
true
that
the
could
not
conceive
the
happiness
of
a
free
life
yet
they
grew
to
understand
and
very
speedily
too
that
they
were
oppressed
by
their
masters
and
they
assumed
you
see
how
justly
that
they
could
do
without
them
though
perhaps
they
scarce
knew
how
so
that
it
came
to
this
that
though
they
could
not
look
forward
to
the
happiness
or
peace
of
the
freeman
they
did
at
least
look
forward
to
the
war
which
a
vague
hope
told
them
would
bring
that
peace
about
could
you
tell
me
rather
more
closely
what
actually
took
place
said
i
for
i
thought
rather
vague
here
yes
he
said
i
can
that
machinery
of
life
for
the
use
of
people
who
did
know
what
they
wanted
of
it
and
which
was
known
at
the
time
as
state
socialism
was
partly
put
in
motion
though
in
a
very
piecemeal
way
but
it
did
not
work
smoothly
it
was
of
course
resisted
at
every
turn
by
the
capitalists
and
no
wonder
for
it
tended
more
and
more
to
upset
the
commercial
system
i
have
told
you
of
without
providing
anything
really
effective
in
its
place
the
result
was
growing
confusion
great
suffering
amongst
the
working
classes
and
as
a
consequence
great
discontent
for
a
long
time
matters
went
on
like
this
the
power
of
the
upper
classes
had
lessened
as
their
command
over
wealth
lessened
and
they
could
not
carry
things
wholly
by
the
high
hand
as
they
had
been
used
to
in
earlier
days
so
far
the
state
socialists
were
justified
by
the
result
on
the
other
hand
the
working
classes
were
and
growing
poorer
in
reality
in
spite
of
the
gains
also
real
in
the
long
run
which
they
had
forced
from
the
masters
thus
matters
hung
in
the
balance
the
masters
could
not
reduce
their
slaves
to
complete
subjection
though
they
put
down
some
feeble
and
partial
riots
easily
enough
the
workers
forced
their
masters
to
grant
them
ameliorations
real
or
imaginary
of
their
condition
but
could
not
force
freedom
from
them
at
last
came
a
great
crash
to
explain
this
you
must
understand
that
very
great
progress
had
been
made
amongst
the
workers
though
as
before
said
but
little
in
the
direction
of
improved
livelihood
i
played
the
innocent
and
said
in
what
direction
could
they
improve
if
not
in
livelihood
said
he
in
the
power
to
bring
about
a
state
of
things
in
which
livelihood
would
be
full
and
easy
to
gain
they
had
at
last
learned
how
to
combine
after
a
long
period
of
mistakes
and
disasters
the
workmen
had
now
a
regular
organization
in
the
struggle
against
their
masters
a
struggle
which
for
more
than
half
a
century
had
been
accepted
as
an
inevitable
part
of
the
conditions
of
the
modern
system
of
labour
and
production
this
combination
had
now
taken
the
form
of
a
federation
of
all
or
almost
all
the
recognised
employments
and
it
was
by
its
means
that
those
betterments
of
the
conditions
of
the
workmen
had
been
forced
from
the
masters
and
though
they
were
not
seldom
mixed
up
with
the
rioting
that
happened
especially
in
the
earlier
days
of
their
organization
it
by
no
means
formed
an
essential
part
of
their
tactics
indeed
at
the
time
i
am
now
speaking
of
they
had
got
to
be
so
strong
that
most
commonly
the
mere
threat
of
a
was
enough
to
gain
any
minor
point
because
they
had
given
up
the
foolish
tactics
of
the
ancient
trades
unions
of
calling
out
of
work
a
part
only
of
the
workers
of
such
and
such
an
industry
and
supporting
them
while
out
of
work
on
the
labour
of
those
that
remained
in
by
this
time
they
had
a
biggish
fund
of
money
for
the
support
of
strikes
and
could
stop
a
certain
industry
altogether
for
a
time
if
they
so
determined
said
i
was
there
not
a
serious
danger
of
such
moneys
being
misused
of
jobbery
in
fact
old
hammond
wriggled
uneasily
on
his
seat
and
said
though
all
this
happened
so
long
ago
i
still
feel
the
pain
of
mere
shame
when
i
have
to
tell
you
that
it
was
more
than
a
danger
that
such
rascality
often
happened
indeed
more
than
once
the
whole
combination
seemed
dropping
to
pieces
because
of
it
but
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
telling
things
looked
so
threatening
and
to
the
workmen
at
least
the
necessity
of
their
dealing
with
the
trouble
which
the
had
brought
about
was
so
clear
that
the
conditions
of
the
times
had
begot
a
deep
seriousness
amongst
all
reasonable
people
a
determination
which
put
aside
all
and
which
to
thinking
men
was
ominous
of
the
change
such
an
element
was
too
dangerous
for
mere
traitors
and
and
one
by
one
they
were
thrust
out
and
mostly
joined
the
declared
reactionaries
how
about
those
ameliorations
said
i
what
were
they
or
rather
of
what
nature
said
he
some
of
them
and
these
of
the
most
practical
importance
to
the
mens
livelihood
were
yielded
by
the
masters
by
direct
compulsion
on
the
part
of
the
men
the
new
conditions
of
labour
so
gained
were
indeed
only
customary
enforced
by
no
law
but
once
established
the
masters
durst
not
attempt
to
withdraw
them
in
face
of
the
growing
power
of
the
combined
workers
some
again
were
steps
on
the
path
of
socialism
the
most
important
of
which
can
be
speedily
summed
up
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
cry
arose
for
compelling
the
masters
to
employ
their
men
a
less
number
of
hours
in
the
day
this
cry
gathered
volume
quickly
and
the
masters
had
to
yield
to
it
but
it
was
of
course
clear
that
unless
this
meant
a
higher
price
for
work
per
hour
it
would
be
a
mere
nullity
and
that
the
masters
unless
forced
would
reduce
it
to
that
therefore
after
a
long
struggle
another
law
was
passed
fixing
a
minimum
price
for
labour
in
the
most
important
industries
which
again
had
to
be
supplemented
by
a
law
fixing
the
maximum
price
on
the
chief
wares
then
considered
necessary
for
a
workman
life
you
were
getting
perilously
near
to
the
late
roman
said
i
smiling
and
the
doling
out
of
bread
to
the
proletariat
so
many
said
at
the
time
said
the
old
man
drily
and
it
has
long
been
a
commonplace
that
that
slough
awaits
state
socialism
in
the
end
if
it
gets
to
the
end
which
as
you
know
it
did
not
with
us
however
it
went
further
than
this
minimum
and
maximum
business
which
by
the
by
we
can
now
see
was
necessary
the
government
now
found
it
imperative
on
them
to
meet
the
outcry
of
the
master
class
at
the
approaching
destruction
of
commerce
as
desirable
had
they
known
it
as
the
extinction
of
the
cholera
which
has
since
happily
taken
place
and
they
were
forced
to
meet
it
by
a
measure
hostile
to
the
masters
the
establishment
of
government
factories
for
the
production
of
necessary
wares
and
markets
for
their
sale
these
measures
taken
altogether
did
do
something
they
were
in
fact
of
the
nature
of
regulations
made
by
the
commander
of
a
beleaguered
city
but
of
course
to
the
privileged
classes
it
seemed
as
if
the
end
of
the
world
were
come
when
such
laws
were
enacted
nor
was
that
altogether
without
a
warrant
the
spread
of
communistic
theories
and
the
partial
practice
of
state
socialism
had
at
first
disturbed
and
at
last
almost
paralysed
the
marvellous
system
of
commerce
under
which
the
old
world
had
lived
so
feverishly
and
had
produced
for
some
few
a
life
of
gambler
pleasure
and
for
many
or
most
a
life
of
mere
misery
over
and
over
again
came
times
as
they
were
called
and
indeed
they
were
bad
enough
for
the
the
year
was
one
of
the
worst
of
these
times
the
workmen
suffered
dreadfully
the
partial
inefficient
government
factories
which
were
terribly
jobbed
all
but
broke
down
and
a
vast
part
of
the
population
had
for
the
time
being
to
be
fed
on
undisguised
charity
as
it
was
called
the
combined
workers
watched
the
situation
with
mingled
hope
and
anxiety
they
had
already
formulated
their
general
demands
but
now
by
a
solemn
and
universal
vote
of
the
whole
of
their
federated
societies
they
insisted
on
the
first
step
being
taken
toward
carrying
out
their
demands
this
step
would
have
led
directly
to
handing
over
the
management
of
the
whole
natural
resources
of
the
country
together
with
the
machinery
for
using
them
into
the
power
of
the
combined
workers
and
the
reduction
of
the
privileged
classes
into
the
position
of
pensioners
obviously
dependent
on
the
pleasure
of
the
workers
the
as
it
was
called
which
was
widely
published
in
the
newspapers
of
the
day
was
in
fact
a
declaration
of
war
and
was
so
accepted
by
the
master
class
they
began
henceforward
to
prepare
for
a
firm
stand
against
the
and
ferocious
communism
of
the
day
as
they
phrased
it
and
as
they
were
in
many
ways
still
very
powerful
or
seemed
so
to
be
they
still
hoped
by
means
of
brute
force
to
regain
some
of
what
they
had
lost
and
perhaps
in
the
end
the
whole
of
it
it
was
said
amongst
them
on
all
hands
that
it
had
been
a
great
mistake
of
the
various
governments
not
to
have
resisted
sooner
and
the
liberals
and
radicals
the
name
as
perhaps
you
may
know
of
the
more
democratically
inclined
part
of
the
ruling
classes
were
much
blamed
for
having
led
the
world
to
this
pass
by
their
pedantry
and
foolish
sentimentality
and
one
gladstone
or
gledstein
probably
judging
by
this
name
of
scandinavian
descent
a
notable
politician
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
especially
singled
out
for
reprobation
in
this
respect
i
need
scarcely
point
out
to
you
the
absurdity
of
all
this
but
terrible
tragedy
lay
hidden
behind
this
grinning
through
a
of
the
reactionary
party
insatiable
greed
of
the
lower
classes
must
be
repressed
people
must
be
taught
a
lesson
these
were
the
sacramental
phrases
current
amongst
the
reactionists
and
ominous
enough
they
were
the
old
man
stopped
to
look
keenly
at
my
attentive
and
wondering
face
and
then
said
i
know
dear
guest
that
i
have
been
using
words
and
phrases
which
few
people
amongst
us
could
understand
without
long
and
laborious
explanation
and
not
even
then
perhaps
but
since
you
have
not
yet
gone
to
sleep
and
since
i
am
speaking
to
you
as
to
a
being
from
another
planet
i
may
venture
to
ask
you
if
you
have
followed
me
thus
far
o
yes
said
i
i
quite
understand
pray
go
on
a
great
deal
of
what
you
have
been
saying
was
common
place
with
us
when
when
yes
said
he
gravely
when
you
were
dwelling
in
the
other
planet
well
now
for
the
crash
aforesaid
on
some
comparatively
trifling
occasion
a
great
meeting
was
summoned
by
the
workmen
leaders
to
meet
in
trafalgar
square
about
the
right
to
meet
in
which
place
there
had
for
years
and
years
been
bickering
the
civic
bourgeois
guard
called
the
police
attacked
the
said
meeting
with
bludgeons
according
to
their
custom
many
people
were
hurt
in
the
of
whom
five
in
all
died
either
trampled
to
death
on
the
spot
or
from
the
effects
of
their
cudgelling
the
meeting
was
scattered
and
some
hundred
of
prisoners
cast
into
gaol
a
similar
meeting
had
been
treated
in
the
same
way
a
few
days
before
at
a
place
called
manchester
which
has
now
disappeared
thus
the
began
the
whole
country
was
thrown
into
a
ferment
by
this
meetings
were
held
which
attempted
some
rough
organisation
for
the
holding
of
another
meeting
to
retort
on
the
authorities
a
huge
crowd
assembled
in
trafalgar
square
and
the
neighbourhood
then
a
place
of
crowded
streets
and
was
too
big
for
the
police
to
cope
with
there
was
a
good
deal
of
fighting
three
or
four
of
the
people
were
killed
and
half
a
score
of
policemen
were
crushed
to
death
in
the
throng
and
the
rest
got
away
as
they
could
this
was
a
victory
for
the
people
as
far
as
it
went
the
next
day
all
london
remember
what
it
was
in
those
days
was
in
a
state
of
turmoil
many
of
the
rich
fled
into
the
country
the
executive
got
together
soldiery
but
did
not
dare
to
use
them
and
the
police
could
not
be
massed
in
any
one
place
because
riots
or
threats
of
riots
were
everywhere
but
in
manchester
where
the
people
were
not
so
courageous
or
not
so
desperate
as
in
london
several
of
the
popular
leaders
were
arrested
in
london
a
convention
of
leaders
was
got
together
from
the
federation
of
combined
workmen
and
sat
under
the
old
revolutionary
name
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
but
as
they
had
no
drilled
and
armed
body
of
men
to
direct
they
attempted
no
aggressive
measures
but
only
placarded
the
walls
with
somewhat
vague
appeals
to
the
workmen
not
to
allow
themselves
to
be
trampled
upon
however
they
called
a
meeting
in
trafalgar
square
for
the
day
fortnight
of
the
skirmish
meantime
the
town
grew
no
quieter
and
business
came
pretty
much
to
an
end
the
newspapers
then
as
always
hitherto
almost
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
masters
clamoured
to
the
government
for
repressive
measures
the
rich
citizens
were
enrolled
as
an
extra
body
of
police
and
armed
with
bludgeons
like
them
many
of
these
were
strong
blooded
young
men
and
had
plenty
of
stomach
for
fighting
but
the
government
did
not
dare
to
use
them
and
contented
itself
with
getting
full
powers
voted
to
it
by
the
parliament
for
suppressing
any
revolt
and
bringing
up
more
and
more
soldiers
to
london
thus
passed
the
week
after
the
great
meeting
almost
as
large
a
one
was
held
on
the
sunday
which
went
off
peaceably
on
the
whole
as
no
opposition
to
it
was
offered
and
again
the
people
cried
but
on
the
monday
the
people
woke
up
to
find
that
they
were
hungry
during
the
last
few
days
there
had
been
groups
of
men
parading
the
streets
asking
or
if
you
please
demanding
money
to
buy
food
and
what
for
goodwill
what
for
fear
the
richer
people
gave
them
a
good
deal
the
authorities
of
the
parishes
also
i
have
time
to
explain
that
phrase
at
present
gave
what
provisions
they
could
to
wandering
people
and
the
government
by
means
of
its
feeble
national
workshops
also
fed
a
good
number
of
folk
but
in
addition
to
this
several
bakers
shops
and
other
provision
stores
had
been
emptied
without
a
great
deal
of
disturbance
so
far
so
good
but
on
the
monday
in
question
the
committee
of
public
safety
on
the
one
hand
afraid
of
general
unorganised
pillage
and
on
the
other
emboldened
by
the
wavering
conduct
of
the
authorities
sent
a
deputation
provided
with
carts
and
all
necessary
gear
to
clear
out
two
or
three
big
provision
stores
in
the
centre
of
the
town
leaving
papers
with
the
shop
managers
promising
to
pay
the
price
of
them
and
also
in
the
part
of
the
town
where
they
were
strongest
they
took
possession
of
several
shops
and
set
men
at
work
in
them
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
all
of
which
was
done
with
little
or
no
disturbance
the
police
assisting
in
keeping
order
at
the
sack
of
the
stores
as
they
would
have
done
at
a
big
fire
but
at
this
last
stroke
the
reactionaries
were
so
alarmed
that
they
were
determined
to
force
the
executive
into
action
the
newspapers
next
day
all
blazed
into
the
fury
of
frightened
people
and
threatened
the
people
the
government
and
everybody
they
could
think
of
unless
were
at
once
restored
a
deputation
of
leading
commercial
people
waited
on
the
government
and
told
them
that
if
they
did
not
at
once
arrest
the
committee
of
public
safety
they
themselves
would
gather
a
body
of
men
arm
them
and
fall
on
incendiaries
as
they
called
them
they
together
with
a
number
of
the
newspaper
editors
had
a
long
interview
with
the
heads
of
the
government
and
two
or
three
military
men
the
deftest
in
their
art
that
the
country
could
furnish
the
deputation
came
away
from
that
interview
says
a
contemporary
smiling
and
satisfied
and
said
no
more
about
raising
an
army
but
that
afternoon
left
london
with
their
families
for
their
country
seats
or
elsewhere
the
next
morning
the
government
proclaimed
a
state
of
siege
in
london
a
thing
common
enough
amongst
the
absolutist
governments
on
the
continent
but
in
england
in
those
days
they
appointed
the
youngest
and
cleverest
of
their
generals
to
command
the
proclaimed
district
a
man
who
had
won
a
certain
sort
of
reputation
in
the
disgraceful
wars
in
which
the
country
had
been
long
engaged
from
time
to
time
the
newspapers
were
in
ecstacies
and
all
the
most
fervent
of
the
reactionaries
now
came
to
the
front
men
who
in
ordinary
times
were
forced
to
keep
their
opinions
to
themselves
or
their
immediate
circle
but
who
began
to
look
forward
to
crushing
once
for
all
the
socialist
and
even
democratic
tendencies
which
said
they
had
been
treated
with
such
foolish
indulgence
for
the
last
sixty
years
but
the
clever
general
took
no
visible
action
and
yet
only
a
few
of
the
minor
newspapers
abused
him
thoughtful
men
gathered
from
this
that
a
plot
was
hatching
as
for
the
committee
of
public
safety
whatever
they
thought
of
their
position
they
had
now
gone
too
far
to
draw
back
and
many
of
them
it
seems
thought
that
the
government
would
not
act
they
went
on
quietly
organising
their
food
supply
which
was
a
miserable
driblet
when
all
is
said
and
also
as
a
retort
to
the
state
of
siege
they
armed
as
many
men
as
they
could
in
the
quarter
where
they
were
strongest
but
did
not
attempt
to
drill
or
organise
them
thinking
perhaps
that
they
could
not
at
the
best
turn
them
into
trained
soldiers
till
they
had
some
breathing
space
the
clever
general
his
soldiers
and
the
police
did
not
meddle
with
all
this
in
the
least
in
the
world
and
things
were
quieter
in
london
that
though
there
were
riots
in
many
places
of
the
provinces
which
were
quelled
by
the
authorities
without
much
trouble
the
most
serious
of
these
were
at
glasgow
and
bristol
well
the
sunday
of
the
meeting
came
and
great
crowds
came
to
trafalgar
square
in
procession
the
greater
part
of
the
committee
amongst
them
surrounded
by
their
band
of
men
armed
somehow
or
other
the
streets
were
quite
peaceful
and
quiet
though
there
were
many
spectators
to
see
the
procession
pass
trafalgar
square
had
no
body
of
police
in
it
the
people
took
quiet
possession
of
it
and
the
meeting
began
the
armed
men
stood
round
the
principal
platform
and
there
were
a
few
others
armed
amidst
the
general
crowd
but
by
far
the
greater
part
were
unarmed
most
people
thought
the
meeting
would
go
off
peaceably
but
the
members
of
the
committee
had
heard
from
various
quarters
that
something
would
be
attempted
against
them
but
these
rumours
were
vague
and
they
had
no
idea
of
what
threatened
they
soon
found
out
for
before
the
streets
about
the
square
were
filled
a
body
of
soldiers
poured
into
it
from
the
corner
and
took
up
their
places
by
the
houses
that
stood
on
the
west
side
the
people
growled
at
the
sight
of
the
the
armed
men
of
the
committee
stood
undecided
not
knowing
what
to
do
and
indeed
this
new
influx
so
jammed
the
crowd
together
that
unorganised
as
they
were
they
had
little
chance
of
working
through
it
they
had
scarcely
grasped
the
fact
of
their
enemies
being
there
when
another
column
of
soldiers
pouring
out
of
the
streets
which
led
into
the
great
southern
road
going
down
to
the
parliament
house
still
existing
and
called
the
dung
market
and
also
from
the
embankment
by
the
side
of
the
thames
marched
up
pushing
the
crowd
into
a
denser
and
denser
mass
and
formed
along
the
south
side
of
the
square
then
any
of
those
who
could
see
what
was
going
on
knew
at
once
that
they
were
in
a
trap
and
could
only
wonder
what
would
be
done
with
them
the
crowd
would
not
or
could
not
budge
except
under
the
influence
of
the
height
of
terror
which
was
soon
to
be
supplied
to
them
a
few
of
the
armed
men
struggled
to
the
front
or
climbled
up
to
the
base
of
the
monument
which
then
stood
there
that
they
might
face
the
wall
of
hidden
fire
before
them
and
to
most
men
there
were
many
women
amongst
them
it
seemed
as
if
the
end
of
the
world
had
come
and
seemed
strangely
different
from
yesterday
no
sooner
were
the
soldiers
drawn
up
aforesaid
than
says
an
glittering
officer
on
horseback
came
prancing
out
from
the
ranks
on
the
south
and
read
something
from
a
paper
which
he
held
in
his
hand
which
something
very
few
heard
but
i
was
told
afterwards
that
it
was
an
order
for
us
to
disperse
and
a
warning
that
he
had
legal
right
to
fire
on
the
crowd
else
and
that
he
would
do
so
the
crowd
took
it
as
a
challenge
of
some
sort
and
a
hoarse
threatening
roar
went
up
from
them
and
after
that
there
was
comparative
silence
for
a
little
till
the
officer
had
got
back
into
the
ranks
i
was
near
the
edge
of
the
crowd
towards
the
soldiers
says
this
i
saw
three
little
machines
being
wheeled
out
in
front
of
the
ranks
which
i
knew
for
mechanical
guns
i
cried
out
throw
yourselves
down
they
are
going
to
fire
but
no
one
scarcely
could
throw
himself
down
so
tight
as
the
crowd
were
packed
i
heard
a
sharp
order
given
and
wondered
where
i
should
be
the
next
minute
and
then
it
was
as
if
the
earth
had
opened
and
hell
had
come
up
bodily
amidst
us
it
is
no
use
trying
to
describe
the
scene
that
followed
deep
lanes
were
mowed
amidst
the
thick
crowd
the
dead
and
dying
covered
the
ground
and
the
shrieks
and
wails
and
cries
of
horror
filled
all
the
air
till
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
nothing
else
in
the
world
but
murder
and
death
those
of
our
armed
men
who
were
still
unhurt
cheered
wildly
and
opened
a
scattering
fire
on
the
soldiers
one
or
two
soldiers
fell
and
i
saw
the
officers
going
up
and
down
the
ranks
urging
the
men
to
fire
again
but
they
received
the
orders
in
sullen
silence
and
let
the
butts
of
their
guns
fall
only
one
sergeant
ran
to
a
and
began
to
set
it
going
but
a
tall
young
man
an
officer
too
ran
out
of
the
ranks
and
dragged
him
back
by
the
collar
and
the
soldiers
stood
there
motionless
while
the
crowd
nearly
wholly
unarmed
for
most
of
the
armed
men
had
fallen
in
that
first
discharge
drifted
out
of
the
square
i
was
told
afterwards
that
the
soldiers
on
the
west
side
had
fired
also
and
done
their
part
of
the
slaughter
how
i
got
out
of
the
square
i
scarcely
know
i
went
not
feeling
the
ground
under
me
what
with
rage
and
terror
and
despair
so
says
our
the
number
of
the
slain
on
the
side
of
the
people
in
that
shooting
during
a
minute
was
prodigious
but
it
was
not
easy
to
come
at
the
truth
about
it
it
was
probably
between
one
and
two
thousand
of
the
soldiers
six
were
killed
outright
and
a
dozen
wounded
i
listened
trembling
with
excitement
the
old
man
eyes
glittered
and
his
face
flushed
as
he
spoke
and
told
the
tale
of
what
i
had
often
thought
might
happen
yet
i
wondered
that
he
should
have
got
so
elated
about
a
mere
massacre
and
i
said
how
fearful
and
i
suppose
that
this
massacre
put
an
end
to
the
whole
revolution
for
that
time
no
no
cried
old
hammond
it
began
it
he
filled
his
glass
and
mine
and
stood
up
and
cried
out
drink
this
glass
to
the
memory
of
those
who
died
there
for
indeed
it
would
be
a
long
tale
to
tell
how
much
we
owe
them
i
drank
and
he
sat
down
again
and
went
on
that
massacre
of
trafalgar
square
began
the
civil
war
though
like
all
such
events
it
gathered
head
slowly
and
people
scarcely
knew
what
a
crisis
they
were
acting
in
terrible
as
the
massacre
was
and
hideous
and
overpowering
as
the
first
terror
had
been
when
the
people
had
time
to
think
about
it
their
feeling
was
one
of
anger
rather
than
fear
although
the
military
organisation
of
the
state
of
siege
was
now
carried
out
without
shrinking
by
the
clever
young
general
for
though
the
when
the
news
spread
next
morning
felt
one
gasp
of
horror
and
even
dread
yet
the
government
and
their
immediate
backers
felt
that
now
the
wine
was
drawn
and
must
be
drunk
however
even
the
most
reactionary
of
the
capitalist
papers
with
two
exceptions
stunned
by
the
tremendous
news
simply
gave
an
account
of
what
had
taken
place
without
making
any
comment
upon
it
the
exceptions
were
one
a
paper
the
government
of
the
day
was
of
that
complexion
which
after
a
preamble
in
which
it
declared
its
undeviating
sympathy
with
the
cause
of
labour
proceeded
to
point
out
that
in
times
of
revolutionary
disturbance
it
behoved
the
government
to
be
just
but
firm
and
that
by
far
the
most
merciful
way
of
dealing
with
the
poor
madmen
who
were
attacking
the
very
foundations
of
society
which
had
made
them
mad
and
poor
was
to
shoot
them
at
once
so
as
to
stop
others
from
drifting
into
a
position
in
which
they
would
run
a
chance
of
being
shot
in
short
it
praised
the
determined
action
of
the
government
as
the
acme
of
human
wisdom
and
mercy
and
exulted
in
the
inauguration
of
an
epoch
of
reasonable
democracy
free
from
the
tyrannical
fads
of
socialism
the
other
exception
was
a
paper
thought
to
be
one
of
the
most
violent
opponents
of
democracy
and
so
it
was
but
the
editor
of
it
found
his
manhood
and
spoke
for
himself
and
not
for
his
paper
in
a
few
simple
indignant
words
he
asked
people
to
consider
what
a
society
was
worth
which
had
to
be
defended
by
the
massacre
of
unarmed
citizens
and
called
on
the
government
to
withdraw
their
state
of
siege
and
put
the
general
and
his
officers
who
fired
on
the
people
on
their
trial
for
murder
he
went
further
and
declared
that
whatever
his
opinion
might
be
as
to
the
doctrines
of
the
socialists
he
for
one
should
throw
in
his
lot
with
the
people
until
the
government
atoned
for
their
atrocity
by
showing
that
they
were
prepared
to
listen
to
the
demands
of
men
who
knew
what
they
wanted
and
whom
the
decrepitude
of
society
forced
into
pushing
their
demands
in
some
way
or
other
of
course
this
editor
was
immediately
arrested
by
the
military
power
but
his
bold
words
were
already
in
the
hands
of
the
public
and
produced
a
great
effect
so
great
an
effect
that
the
government
after
some
vacillation
withdrew
the
state
of
siege
though
at
the
same
time
it
strengthened
the
military
organisation
and
made
it
more
stringent
three
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
had
been
slain
in
trafalgar
square
of
the
rest
the
greater
part
went
back
to
their
old
place
of
meeting
and
there
awaited
the
event
calmly
they
were
arrested
there
on
the
monday
morning
and
would
have
been
shot
at
once
by
the
general
who
was
a
mere
military
machine
if
the
government
had
not
shrunk
before
the
responsibility
of
killing
men
without
any
trial
there
was
at
first
a
talk
of
trying
them
by
a
special
commission
of
judges
as
it
was
called
before
a
set
of
men
bound
to
find
them
guilty
and
whose
business
it
was
to
do
so
but
with
the
government
the
cold
fit
had
succeeded
to
the
hot
one
and
the
prisoners
were
brought
before
a
jury
at
the
assizes
there
a
fresh
blow
awaited
the
government
for
in
spite
of
the
judge
charge
which
distinctly
instructed
the
jury
to
find
the
prisoners
guilty
they
were
acquitted
and
the
jury
added
to
their
verdict
a
presentment
in
which
they
condemned
the
action
of
the
soldiery
in
the
queer
phraseology
of
the
day
as
unfortunate
and
unnecessary
the
committee
of
public
safety
renewed
its
sittings
and
from
thenceforth
was
a
popular
in
opposition
to
the
parliament
the
government
now
gave
way
on
all
sides
and
made
a
show
of
yielding
to
the
demands
of
the
people
though
there
was
a
widespread
plot
for
effecting
a
coup
set
on
foot
between
the
leaders
of
the
two
called
opposing
parties
in
the
parliamentary
faction
fight
the
meaning
part
of
the
public
was
overjoyed
and
thought
that
all
danger
of
a
civil
war
was
over
the
victory
of
the
people
was
celebrated
by
huge
meetings
held
in
the
parks
and
elsewhere
in
memory
of
the
victims
of
the
great
massacre
but
the
measures
passed
for
the
relief
of
the
workers
though
to
the
upper
classes
they
seemed
ruinously
revolutionary
were
not
thorough
enough
to
give
the
people
food
and
a
decent
life
and
they
had
to
be
supplemented
by
unwritten
enactments
without
legality
to
back
them
although
the
government
and
parliament
had
the
the
army
and
at
their
backs
the
committee
of
public
safety
began
to
be
a
force
in
the
country
and
really
represented
the
producing
classes
it
began
to
improve
immensely
in
the
days
which
followed
on
the
acquittal
of
its
members
its
old
members
had
little
administrative
capacity
though
with
the
exception
of
a
few
and
traitors
they
were
honest
courageous
men
and
many
of
them
were
endowed
with
considerable
talent
of
other
kinds
but
now
that
the
times
called
for
immediate
action
came
forward
the
men
capable
of
setting
it
on
foot
and
a
new
network
of
workmen
associations
grew
up
very
speedily
whose
avowed
single
object
was
the
tiding
over
of
the
ship
of
the
community
into
a
simple
condition
of
communism
and
as
they
practically
undertook
also
the
management
of
the
ordinary
they
soon
became
the
mouthpiece
and
intermediary
of
the
whole
of
the
working
classes
and
the
manufacturing
now
found
themselves
powerless
before
this
combination
unless
committee
parliament
plucked
up
courage
to
begin
the
civil
war
again
and
to
shoot
right
and
left
they
were
bound
to
yield
to
the
demands
of
the
men
whom
they
employed
and
pay
higher
and
higher
wages
for
shorter
and
shorter
day
work
yet
one
ally
they
had
and
that
was
the
rapidly
approaching
breakdown
of
the
whole
system
founded
on
the
and
its
supply
which
now
became
so
clear
to
all
people
that
the
middle
classes
shocked
for
the
moment
into
condemnation
of
the
government
for
the
great
massacre
turned
round
nearly
in
a
mass
and
called
on
the
government
to
look
to
matters
and
put
an
end
to
the
tyranny
of
the
socialist
leaders
thus
stimulated
the
reactionist
plot
exploded
probably
before
it
was
ripe
but
this
time
the
people
and
their
leaders
were
forewarned
and
before
the
reactionaries
could
get
under
way
had
taken
the
steps
they
thought
necessary
the
liberal
government
clearly
by
collusion
was
beaten
by
the
conservatives
though
the
latter
were
nominally
much
in
the
minority
the
popular
representatives
in
the
house
understood
pretty
well
what
this
meant
and
after
an
attempt
to
fight
the
matter
out
by
divisions
in
the
house
of
commons
they
made
a
protest
left
the
house
and
came
in
a
body
to
the
committee
of
public
safety
and
the
civil
war
began
again
in
good
earnest
yet
its
first
act
was
not
one
of
mere
fighting
the
new
tory
government
determined
to
act
yet
durst
not
the
state
of
siege
but
it
sent
a
body
of
soldiers
and
police
to
arrest
the
committee
of
public
safety
in
the
lump
they
made
no
resistance
though
they
might
have
done
so
as
they
had
now
a
considerable
body
of
men
who
were
quite
prepared
for
extremities
but
they
were
determined
to
try
first
a
weapon
which
they
thought
stronger
than
street
fighting
the
members
of
the
committee
went
off
quietly
to
prison
but
they
had
left
their
soul
and
their
organisation
behind
them
for
they
depended
not
on
a
carefully
arranged
centre
with
all
kinds
of
checks
and
checks
about
it
but
on
a
huge
mass
of
people
in
thorough
sympathy
with
the
movement
bound
together
by
a
great
number
of
links
of
small
centres
with
very
simple
instructions
these
instructions
were
now
carried
out
the
next
morning
when
the
leaders
of
the
reaction
were
chuckling
at
the
effect
which
the
report
in
the
newspapers
of
their
stroke
would
have
upon
the
public
no
newspapers
appeared
and
it
was
only
towards
noon
that
a
few
straggling
sheets
about
the
size
of
the
gazettes
of
the
seventeenth
century
worked
by
policemen
soldiers
managers
and
were
dribbled
through
the
streets
they
were
greedily
seized
on
and
read
but
by
this
time
the
serious
part
of
their
news
was
stale
and
people
did
not
need
to
be
told
that
the
general
strike
had
begun
the
railways
did
not
run
the
were
unserved
flesh
fish
and
green
stuff
brought
to
market
was
allowed
to
lie
there
still
packed
and
perishing
the
thousands
of
families
who
were
utterly
dependant
for
the
next
meal
on
the
workers
made
frantic
efforts
through
their
more
energetic
members
to
cater
for
the
needs
of
the
day
and
amongst
those
of
them
who
could
throw
off
the
fear
of
what
was
to
follow
there
was
i
am
told
a
certain
enjoyment
of
this
unexpected
picnic
a
forecast
of
the
days
to
come
in
which
all
labour
grew
pleasant
so
passed
the
first
day
and
towards
evening
the
government
grew
quite
distracted
they
had
but
one
resource
for
putting
down
any
popular
movement
to
wit
mere
but
there
was
nothing
for
them
against
which
to
use
their
army
and
police
no
armed
bodies
appeared
in
the
streets
the
offices
of
the
federated
workmen
were
now
in
appearance
at
least
turned
into
places
for
the
relief
of
people
thrown
out
of
work
and
under
the
circumstances
they
durst
not
arrest
the
men
engaged
in
such
business
all
the
more
as
even
that
night
many
quite
respectable
people
applied
at
these
offices
for
relief
and
swallowed
down
the
charity
of
the
revolutionists
along
with
their
supper
so
the
government
massed
soldiers
and
police
here
and
there
and
sat
still
for
that
night
fully
expecting
on
the
morrow
some
manifesto
from
rebels
as
they
now
began
to
be
called
which
would
give
them
an
opportunity
of
acting
in
some
way
or
another
they
were
disappointed
the
ordinary
newspapers
gave
up
the
struggle
that
morning
and
only
one
very
violent
reactionary
paper
called
the
attempted
an
appearance
and
rated
rebels
in
good
set
terms
for
their
folly
and
ingratitude
in
tearing
out
the
bowels
of
their
mother
the
english
nation
for
the
benefit
of
a
few
greedy
paid
agitators
and
the
fools
whom
they
were
deluding
on
the
other
hand
the
socialist
papers
of
which
three
only
representing
somewhat
different
schools
were
published
in
london
came
out
full
to
the
throat
of
matter
they
were
greedily
bought
by
the
whole
public
who
of
course
like
the
government
expected
a
manifesto
in
them
but
they
found
no
word
of
reference
to
the
great
subject
it
seemed
as
if
their
editors
had
ransacked
their
drawers
for
articles
which
would
have
been
in
place
forty
years
before
under
the
technical
name
of
educational
articles
most
of
these
were
admirable
and
straightforward
expositions
of
the
doctrines
and
practice
of
socialism
free
from
haste
and
spite
and
hard
words
and
came
upon
the
public
with
a
kind
of
freshness
amidst
the
worry
and
terror
of
the
moment
and
though
the
knowing
well
understood
that
the
meaning
of
this
move
in
the
game
was
mere
defiance
and
a
token
of
irreconcilable
hostility
to
the
then
rulers
of
society
and
though
also
they
were
meant
for
nothing
else
by
rebels
yet
they
really
had
their
effect
as
articles
however
of
another
kind
was
acting
upon
the
public
with
irresistible
power
and
probably
cleared
their
heads
a
little
as
to
the
government
they
were
absolutely
terrified
by
this
act
of
the
slang
word
then
current
for
such
acts
of
abstention
their
counsels
became
wild
and
vacillating
to
the
last
degree
one
hour
they
were
for
giving
way
for
the
present
till
they
could
hatch
another
plot
the
next
they
all
but
sent
an
order
for
the
arrest
in
the
lump
of
all
the
workmen
committees
the
next
they
were
on
the
point
of
ordering
their
brisk
young
general
to
take
any
excuse
that
offered
for
another
massacre
but
when
they
called
to
mind
that
the
soldiery
in
that
of
trafalgar
square
were
so
daunted
by
the
slaughter
which
they
had
made
that
they
could
not
be
got
to
fire
a
second
volley
they
shrank
back
again
from
the
dreadful
courage
necessary
for
carrying
out
another
massacre
meantime
the
prisoners
brought
the
second
time
before
the
magistrates
under
a
strong
escort
of
soldiers
were
the
second
time
remanded
the
strike
went
on
this
day
also
the
workmen
committees
were
extended
and
gave
relief
to
great
numbers
of
people
for
they
had
organised
a
considerable
amount
of
production
of
food
by
men
whom
they
could
depend
upon
quite
a
number
of
people
were
now
compelled
to
seek
relief
of
them
but
another
curious
thing
happened
a
band
of
young
men
of
the
upper
classes
armed
themselves
and
coolly
went
marauding
in
the
streets
taking
what
suited
them
of
such
eatables
and
portables
that
they
came
across
in
the
shops
which
had
ventured
to
open
this
operation
they
carried
out
in
oxford
street
then
a
great
street
of
shops
of
all
kinds
the
government
being
at
that
hour
in
one
of
their
yielding
moods
thought
this
a
fine
opportunity
for
showing
their
impartiality
in
the
maintenance
of
and
sent
to
arrest
these
hungry
rich
youths
who
however
surprised
the
police
by
a
valiant
resistance
so
that
all
but
three
escaped
the
government
did
not
gain
the
reputation
for
impartiality
which
they
expected
from
this
move
for
they
forgot
that
there
were
no
evening
papers
and
the
account
of
the
skirmish
spread
wide
indeed
but
in
a
distorted
form
for
it
was
mostly
told
simply
as
an
exploit
of
the
starving
people
from
the
and
everybody
thought
it
was
but
natural
for
the
government
to
put
them
down
when
and
where
they
could
that
evening
the
rebel
prisoners
were
visited
in
their
cells
by
polite
and
sympathetic
persons
who
pointed
out
to
them
what
a
suicidal
course
they
were
following
and
how
dangerous
these
extreme
courses
were
for
the
popular
cause
says
one
of
the
prisoners
was
great
sport
comparing
notes
when
we
came
out
anent
the
attempt
of
the
government
to
get
at
us
separately
in
prison
and
how
we
answered
the
blandishments
of
the
highly
intelligent
and
refined
persons
set
on
to
pump
us
one
laughed
another
told
extravagant
stories
to
the
envoy
a
third
held
a
sulky
silence
a
fourth
damned
the
polite
spy
and
bade
him
hold
his
jaw
and
that
was
all
they
got
out
of
us
so
passed
the
second
day
of
the
great
strike
it
was
clear
to
all
thinking
people
that
the
third
day
would
bring
on
the
crisis
for
the
present
suspense
and
terror
was
unendurable
the
ruling
classes
and
the
who
had
been
their
real
strength
and
support
were
as
sheep
lacking
a
shepherd
they
literally
did
not
know
what
to
do
one
thing
they
found
they
had
to
do
try
to
get
the
to
do
something
so
the
next
morning
the
morning
of
the
third
day
of
the
strike
when
the
members
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
appeared
again
before
the
magistrate
they
found
themselves
treated
with
the
greatest
possible
courtesy
in
fact
rather
as
envoys
and
ambassadors
than
prisoners
in
short
the
magistrate
had
received
his
orders
and
with
no
more
to
do
than
might
come
of
a
long
stupid
speech
which
might
have
been
written
by
dickens
in
mockery
he
discharged
the
prisoners
who
went
back
to
their
and
at
once
began
a
due
sitting
it
was
high
time
for
this
third
day
the
mass
was
fermenting
indeed
there
was
of
course
a
vast
number
of
working
people
who
were
not
organised
in
the
least
in
the
world
men
who
had
been
used
to
act
as
their
masters
drove
them
or
rather
as
the
system
drove
of
which
their
masters
were
a
part
that
system
was
now
falling
to
pieces
and
the
old
pressure
of
the
master
having
been
taken
off
these
poor
men
it
seemed
likely
that
nothing
but
the
mere
animal
necessities
and
passions
of
men
would
have
any
hold
on
them
and
that
mere
general
overturn
would
be
the
result
doubtless
this
would
have
happened
if
it
had
not
been
that
the
huge
mass
had
been
leavened
by
socialist
opinion
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
second
by
actual
contact
with
declared
socialists
many
or
indeed
most
of
whom
were
members
of
those
bodies
of
workmen
above
said
if
anything
of
this
kind
had
happened
some
years
before
when
the
masters
of
labour
were
still
looked
upon
as
the
natural
rulers
of
the
people
and
even
the
poorest
and
most
ignorant
man
leaned
upon
them
for
support
while
they
submitted
to
their
fleecing
the
entire
of
all
society
would
have
followed
but
the
long
series
of
years
during
which
the
workmen
had
learned
to
despise
their
rulers
had
done
away
with
their
dependence
upon
them
and
they
were
now
beginning
to
trust
somewhat
dangerously
as
events
proved
in
the
leaders
whom
events
had
thrust
forward
and
though
most
of
these
were
now
become
mere
their
names
and
reputations
were
useful
in
this
crisis
as
a
the
effect
of
the
news
therefore
of
the
release
of
the
committee
gave
the
government
some
breathing
time
for
it
was
received
with
the
greatest
joy
by
the
workers
and
even
the
saw
in
it
a
respite
from
the
mere
destruction
which
they
had
begun
to
dread
and
the
fear
of
which
most
of
them
attributed
to
the
weakness
of
the
government
as
far
as
the
passing
hour
went
perhaps
they
were
right
in
this
how
do
you
mean
said
i
what
could
the
government
have
done
i
often
used
to
think
that
they
would
be
helpless
in
such
a
crisis
said
old
hammond
of
course
i
do
doubt
that
in
the
long
run
matters
would
have
come
about
as
they
did
but
if
the
government
could
have
treated
their
army
as
a
real
army
and
used
them
strategically
as
a
general
would
have
done
looking
on
the
people
as
a
mere
open
enemy
to
be
shot
at
and
dispersed
wherever
they
turned
up
they
would
probably
have
gained
the
victory
at
the
time
but
would
the
soldiers
have
acted
against
the
people
in
this
way
said
i
said
he
i
think
from
all
i
have
heard
that
they
would
have
done
so
if
they
had
met
bodies
of
men
armed
however
badly
and
however
badly
they
had
been
organised
it
seems
also
as
if
before
the
trafalgar
square
massacre
they
might
as
a
whole
have
been
depended
upon
to
fire
upon
an
unarmed
crowd
though
they
were
much
honeycombed
by
socialism
the
reason
for
this
was
that
they
dreaded
the
use
by
apparently
unarmed
men
of
an
explosive
called
dynamite
of
which
many
loud
boasts
were
made
by
the
workers
on
the
eve
of
these
events
although
it
turned
out
to
be
of
little
use
as
a
material
for
war
in
the
way
that
was
expected
of
course
the
officers
of
the
soldiery
fanned
this
fear
to
the
utmost
so
that
the
rank
and
file
probably
thought
on
that
occasion
that
they
were
being
led
into
a
desperate
battle
with
men
who
were
really
armed
and
whose
weapon
was
the
more
dreadful
because
it
was
concealed
after
that
massacre
however
it
was
at
all
times
doubtful
if
the
regular
soldiers
would
fire
upon
an
unarmed
or
crowd
said
i
the
regular
soldiers
then
there
were
other
combatants
against
the
people
yes
said
he
we
shall
come
to
that
presently
certainly
i
said
you
had
better
go
on
straight
with
your
story
i
see
that
time
is
wearing
said
hammond
the
government
lost
no
time
in
coming
to
terms
with
the
committee
of
public
safety
for
indeed
they
could
think
of
nothing
else
than
the
danger
of
the
moment
they
sent
a
duly
accredited
envoy
to
treat
with
these
men
who
somehow
had
obtained
dominion
over
minds
while
the
formal
rulers
had
no
hold
except
over
their
bodies
there
is
no
need
at
present
to
go
into
the
details
of
the
truce
for
such
it
was
between
these
high
contracting
parties
the
government
of
the
empire
of
great
britain
and
a
handful
of
as
they
were
called
in
scorn
in
those
days
amongst
whom
indeed
were
some
very
capable
and
persons
though
as
aforesaid
the
abler
men
were
not
then
the
recognised
leaders
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
all
the
definite
claims
of
the
people
had
to
be
granted
we
can
now
see
that
most
of
these
claims
were
of
themselves
not
worth
either
demanding
or
resisting
but
they
were
looked
on
at
that
time
as
most
important
and
they
were
at
least
tokens
of
revolt
against
the
miserable
system
of
life
which
was
then
beginning
to
tumble
to
pieces
one
claim
however
was
of
the
utmost
immediate
importance
and
this
the
government
tried
hard
to
evade
but
as
they
were
not
dealing
with
fools
they
had
to
yield
at
last
this
was
the
claim
of
recognition
and
formal
status
for
the
committee
of
public
safety
and
all
the
associations
which
it
fostered
under
its
wing
this
it
is
clear
meant
two
things
first
amnesty
for
rebels
great
and
small
who
without
a
distinct
act
of
civil
war
could
no
longer
be
attacked
and
next
a
continuance
of
the
organised
revolution
only
one
point
the
government
could
gain
and
that
was
a
name
the
dreadful
revolutionary
title
was
dropped
and
the
body
with
its
branches
acted
under
the
respectable
name
of
the
of
conciliation
and
its
local
offices
carrying
this
name
it
became
the
leader
of
the
people
in
the
civil
war
which
soon
followed
o
said
i
somewhat
startled
so
the
civil
war
went
on
in
spite
of
all
that
had
happened
so
it
was
said
he
in
fact
it
was
this
very
legal
recognition
which
made
the
civil
war
possible
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
war
it
took
the
struggle
out
of
the
element
of
mere
massacres
on
one
side
and
endurance
plus
strikes
on
the
other
and
can
you
tell
me
in
what
kind
of
way
the
war
was
carried
on
said
i
yes
he
said
we
have
records
and
to
spare
of
all
that
and
the
essence
of
them
i
can
give
you
in
a
few
words
as
i
told
you
the
rank
and
file
of
the
army
was
not
to
be
trusted
by
the
reactionists
but
the
officers
generally
were
prepared
for
anything
for
they
were
mostly
the
very
stupidest
men
in
the
country
whatever
the
government
might
do
a
great
part
of
the
upper
and
middle
classes
were
determined
to
set
on
foot
a
counter
revolution
for
the
communism
which
now
loomed
ahead
seemed
quite
unendurable
to
them
bands
of
young
men
like
the
marauders
in
the
great
strike
of
whom
i
told
you
just
now
armed
themselves
and
drilled
and
began
on
any
opportunity
or
pretence
to
skirmish
with
the
people
in
the
streets
the
government
neither
helped
them
nor
put
them
down
but
stood
by
hoping
that
something
might
come
of
it
these
of
order
as
they
were
called
had
some
successes
at
first
and
grew
bolder
they
got
many
officers
of
the
regular
army
to
help
them
and
by
their
means
laid
hold
of
munitions
of
war
of
all
kinds
one
part
of
their
tactics
consisted
in
their
guarding
and
even
garrisoning
the
big
factories
of
the
period
they
held
at
one
time
for
instance
the
whole
of
that
place
called
manchester
which
i
spoke
of
just
now
a
sort
of
irregular
war
was
carried
on
with
varied
success
all
over
the
country
and
at
last
the
government
which
at
first
pretended
to
ignore
the
struggle
or
treat
it
as
mere
rioting
definitely
declared
for
friends
of
order
and
joined
to
their
bands
whatsoever
of
the
regular
army
they
could
get
together
and
made
a
desperate
effort
to
overwhelm
rebels
as
they
were
now
once
more
called
and
as
indeed
they
called
themselves
it
was
too
late
all
ideas
of
peace
on
a
basis
of
compromise
had
disappeared
on
either
side
the
end
it
was
seen
clearly
must
be
either
absolute
slavery
for
all
but
the
privileged
or
a
system
of
life
founded
on
equality
and
communism
the
sloth
the
hopelessness
and
if
i
may
say
so
the
cowardice
of
the
last
century
had
given
place
to
the
eager
restless
heroism
of
a
declared
revolutionary
period
i
will
not
say
that
the
people
of
that
time
foresaw
the
life
we
are
leading
now
but
there
was
a
general
instinct
amongst
them
towards
the
essential
part
of
that
life
and
many
men
saw
clearly
beyond
the
desperate
struggle
of
the
day
into
the
peace
which
it
was
to
bring
about
the
men
of
that
day
who
were
on
the
side
of
freedom
were
not
unhappy
i
think
though
they
were
harassed
by
hopes
and
fears
and
sometimes
torn
by
doubts
and
the
conflict
of
duties
hard
to
reconcile
but
how
did
the
people
the
revolutionists
carry
on
the
war
what
were
the
elements
of
success
on
their
side
i
put
this
question
because
i
wanted
to
bring
the
old
man
back
to
the
definite
history
and
take
him
out
of
the
musing
mood
so
natural
to
an
old
man
he
answered
well
they
did
not
lack
organisers
for
the
very
conflict
itself
in
days
when
as
i
told
you
men
of
any
strength
of
mind
cast
away
all
consideration
for
the
ordinary
business
of
life
developed
the
necessary
talent
amongst
them
indeed
from
all
i
have
read
and
heard
i
much
doubt
whether
without
this
seemingly
dreadful
civil
war
the
due
talent
for
administration
would
have
been
developed
amongst
the
working
men
anyhow
it
was
there
and
they
soon
got
leaders
far
more
than
equal
to
the
best
men
amongst
the
reactionaries
for
the
rest
they
had
no
difficulty
about
the
material
of
their
army
for
that
revolutionary
instinct
so
acted
on
the
ordinary
soldier
in
the
ranks
that
the
greater
part
certainly
the
best
part
of
the
soldiers
joined
the
side
of
the
people
but
the
main
element
of
their
success
was
this
that
wherever
the
working
people
were
not
coerced
they
worked
not
for
the
reactionists
but
for
rebels
the
reactionists
could
get
no
work
done
for
them
outside
the
districts
where
they
were
and
even
in
those
districts
they
were
harassed
by
continual
risings
and
in
all
cases
and
everywhere
got
nothing
done
without
obstruction
and
black
looks
and
sulkiness
so
that
not
only
were
their
armies
quite
worn
out
with
the
difficulties
which
they
had
to
meet
but
the
who
were
on
their
side
were
so
worried
and
beset
with
hatred
and
a
thousand
little
troubles
and
annoyances
that
life
became
almost
unendurable
to
them
on
those
terms
not
a
few
of
them
actually
died
of
the
worry
many
committed
suicide
of
course
a
vast
number
of
them
joined
actively
in
the
cause
of
reaction
and
found
some
solace
to
their
misery
in
the
eagerness
of
conflict
lastly
many
thousands
gave
way
and
submitted
to
rebels
and
as
the
numbers
of
these
latter
increased
it
at
last
became
clear
to
all
men
that
the
cause
which
was
once
hopeless
was
now
triumphant
and
that
the
hopeless
cause
was
that
of
slavery
and
privilege
chapter

the
beginning
of
the
new
life
well
said
i
so
you
got
clear
out
of
all
your
trouble
were
people
satisfied
with
the
new
order
of
things
when
it
came
people
he
said
well
surely
all
must
have
been
glad
of
peace
when
it
came
especially
when
they
found
as
they
must
have
found
that
after
all
they
even
the
once
rich
were
not
living
very
badly
as
to
those
who
had
been
poor
all
through
the
war
which
lasted
about
two
years
their
condition
had
been
bettering
in
spite
of
the
struggle
and
when
peace
came
at
last
in
a
very
short
time
they
made
great
strides
towards
a
decent
life
the
great
difficulty
was
that
the
had
such
a
feeble
conception
of
the
real
pleasure
of
life
so
to
say
they
did
not
ask
enough
did
not
know
how
to
ask
enough
from
the
new
state
of
things
it
was
perhaps
rather
a
good
than
an
evil
thing
that
the
necessity
for
restoring
the
wealth
destroyed
during
the
war
forced
them
into
working
at
first
almost
as
hard
as
they
had
been
used
to
before
the
revolution
for
all
historians
are
agreed
that
there
never
was
a
war
in
which
there
was
so
much
destruction
of
wares
and
instruments
for
making
them
as
in
this
civil
war
i
am
rather
surprised
at
that
said
i
are
you
i
do
see
why
said
hammond
why
i
said
because
the
party
of
order
would
surely
look
upon
the
wealth
as
their
own
property
no
share
of
which
if
they
could
help
it
should
go
to
their
slaves
supposing
they
conquered
and
on
the
other
hand
it
was
just
for
the
possession
of
that
wealth
that
were
fighting
and
i
should
have
thought
especially
when
they
saw
that
they
were
winning
that
they
would
have
been
careful
to
destroy
as
little
as
possible
of
what
was
so
soon
to
be
their
own
it
was
as
i
have
told
you
however
said
he
the
party
of
order
when
they
recovered
from
their
first
cowardice
of
surprise
or
if
you
please
when
they
fairly
saw
that
whatever
happened
they
would
be
ruined
fought
with
great
bitterness
and
cared
little
what
they
did
so
long
as
they
injured
the
enemies
who
had
destroyed
the
sweets
of
life
for
them
as
to
rebels
i
have
told
you
that
the
outbreak
of
actual
war
made
them
careless
of
trying
to
save
the
wretched
scraps
of
wealth
that
they
had
it
was
a
common
saying
amongst
them
let
the
country
be
cleared
of
everything
except
valiant
living
men
rather
than
that
we
fall
into
slavery
again
he
sat
silently
thinking
a
little
while
and
then
said
when
the
conflict
was
once
really
begun
it
was
seen
how
little
of
any
value
there
was
in
the
old
world
of
slavery
and
inequality
do
you
see
what
it
means
in
the
times
which
you
are
thinking
of
and
of
which
you
seem
to
know
so
much
there
was
no
hope
nothing
but
the
dull
jog
of
the
under
compulsion
of
collar
and
whip
but
in
that
time
that
followed
all
was
hope
rebels
at
least
felt
themselves
strong
enough
to
build
up
the
world
again
from
its
dry
bones
and
they
did
it
too
said
the
old
man
his
eyes
glittering
under
his
beetling
brows
he
went
on
and
their
opponents
at
least
and
at
last
learned
something
about
the
reality
of
life
and
its
sorrows
which
they
their
class
i
mean
had
once
known
nothing
of
in
short
the
two
combatants
the
workman
and
the
gentleman
between
them
between
them
said
i
quickly
they
destroyed
commercialism
yes
yes
yes
said
he
that
is
it
nor
could
it
have
been
destroyed
otherwise
except
perhaps
by
the
whole
of
society
gradually
falling
into
lower
depths
till
it
should
at
last
reach
a
condition
as
rude
as
barbarism
but
lacking
both
the
hope
and
the
pleasures
of
barbarism
surely
the
sharper
shorter
remedy
was
the
happiest
most
surely
said
i
yes
said
the
old
man
the
world
was
being
brought
to
its
second
birth
how
could
that
take
place
without
a
tragedy
moreover
think
of
it
the
spirit
of
the
new
days
of
our
days
was
to
be
delight
in
the
life
of
the
world
intense
and
overweening
love
of
the
very
skin
and
surface
of
the
earth
on
which
man
dwells
such
as
a
lover
has
in
the
fair
flesh
of
the
woman
he
loves
this
i
say
was
to
be
the
new
spirit
of
the
time
all
other
moods
save
this
had
been
exhausted
the
unceasing
criticism
the
boundless
curiosity
in
the
ways
and
thoughts
of
man
which
was
the
mood
of
the
ancient
greek
to
whom
these
things
were
not
so
much
a
means
as
an
end
was
gone
past
recovery
nor
had
there
been
really
any
shadow
of
it
in
the
science
of
the
nineteenth
century
which
as
you
must
know
was
in
the
main
an
appendage
to
the
commercial
system
nay
not
seldom
an
appendage
to
the
police
of
that
system
in
spite
of
appearances
it
was
limited
and
cowardly
because
it
did
not
really
believe
in
itself
it
was
the
outcome
as
it
was
the
sole
relief
of
the
unhappiness
of
the
period
which
made
life
so
bitter
even
to
the
rich
and
which
as
you
may
see
with
your
bodily
eyes
the
great
change
has
swept
away
more
akin
to
our
way
of
looking
at
life
was
the
spirit
of
the
middle
ages
to
whom
heaven
and
the
life
of
the
next
world
was
such
a
reality
that
it
became
to
them
a
part
of
the
life
upon
the
earth
which
accordingly
they
loved
and
adorned
in
spite
of
the
ascetic
doctrines
of
their
formal
creed
which
bade
them
contemn
it
but
that
also
with
its
assured
belief
in
heaven
and
hell
as
two
countries
in
which
to
live
has
gone
and
now
we
do
both
in
word
and
in
deed
believe
in
the
continuous
life
of
the
world
of
men
and
as
it
were
add
every
day
of
that
common
life
to
the
little
stock
of
days
which
our
own
mere
individual
experience
wins
for
us
and
consequently
we
are
happy
do
you
wonder
at
it
in
times
past
indeed
men
were
told
to
love
their
kind
to
believe
in
the
religion
of
humanity
and
so
forth
but
look
you
just
in
the
degree
that
a
man
had
elevation
of
mind
and
refinement
enough
to
be
able
to
value
this
idea
was
he
repelled
by
the
obvious
aspect
of
the
individuals
composing
the
mass
which
he
was
to
worship
and
he
could
only
evade
that
repulsion
by
making
a
conventional
abstraction
of
mankind
that
had
little
actual
or
historical
relation
to
the
race
which
to
his
eyes
was
divided
into
blind
tyrants
on
the
one
hand
and
apathetic
degraded
slaves
on
the
other
but
now
where
is
the
difficulty
in
accepting
the
religion
of
humanity
when
the
men
and
women
who
go
to
make
up
humanity
are
free
happy
and
energetic
at
least
and
most
commonly
beautiful
of
body
also
and
surrounded
by
beautiful
things
of
their
own
fashioning
and
a
nature
bettered
and
not
worsened
by
contact
with
mankind
this
is
what
this
age
of
the
world
has
reserved
for
us
it
seems
true
said
i
or
ought
to
be
if
what
my
eyes
have
seen
is
a
token
of
the
general
life
you
lead
can
you
now
tell
me
anything
of
your
progress
after
the
years
of
the
struggle
said
he
i
could
easily
tell
you
more
than
you
have
time
to
listen
to
but
i
can
at
least
hint
at
one
of
the
chief
difficulties
which
had
to
be
met
and
that
was
that
when
men
began
to
settle
down
after
the
war
and
their
labour
had
pretty
much
filled
up
the
gap
in
wealth
caused
by
the
destruction
of
that
war
a
kind
of
disappointment
seemed
coming
over
us
and
the
prophecies
of
some
of
the
reactionists
of
past
times
seemed
as
if
they
would
come
true
and
a
dull
level
of
utilitarian
comfort
be
the
end
for
a
while
of
our
aspirations
and
success
the
loss
of
the
competitive
spur
to
exertion
had
not
indeed
done
anything
to
interfere
with
the
necessary
production
of
the
community
but
how
if
it
should
make
men
dull
by
giving
them
too
much
time
for
thought
or
idle
musing
but
after
all
this
dull
only
threatened
us
and
then
passed
over
probably
from
what
i
have
told
you
before
you
will
have
a
guess
at
the
remedy
for
such
a
disaster
remembering
always
that
many
of
the
things
which
used
to
be
produced
for
the
poor
and
mere
wares
for
the
rich
ceased
to
be
made
that
remedy
was
in
short
the
production
of
what
used
to
be
called
art
but
which
has
no
name
amongst
us
now
because
it
has
become
a
necessary
part
of
the
labour
of
every
man
who
produces
said
i
what
had
men
any
time
or
opportunity
for
cultivating
the
fine
arts
amidst
the
desperate
struggle
for
life
and
freedom
that
you
have
told
me
of
said
hammond
you
must
not
suppose
that
the
new
form
of
art
was
founded
chiefly
on
the
memory
of
the
art
of
the
past
although
strange
to
say
the
civil
war
was
much
less
destructive
of
art
than
of
other
things
and
though
what
of
art
existed
under
the
old
forms
revived
in
a
wonderful
way
during
the
latter
part
of
the
struggle
especially
as
regards
music
and
poetry
the
art
or
as
one
ought
to
call
it
of
which
i
am
now
speaking
sprung
up
almost
spontaneously
it
seems
from
a
kind
of
instinct
amongst
people
no
longer
driven
desperately
to
painful
and
terrible
to
do
the
best
they
could
with
the
work
in
hand
to
make
it
excellent
of
its
kind
and
when
that
had
gone
on
for
a
little
a
craving
for
beauty
seemed
to
awaken
in
men
minds
and
they
began
rudely
and
awkwardly
to
ornament
the
wares
which
they
made
and
when
they
had
once
set
to
work
at
that
it
soon
began
to
grow
all
this
was
much
helped
by
the
abolition
of
the
squalor
which
our
immediate
ancestors
put
up
with
so
coolly
and
by
the
leisurely
but
not
stupid
which
now
grew
as
i
told
you
before
to
be
common
amongst
us
thus
at
last
and
by
slow
degrees
we
got
pleasure
into
our
work
then
we
became
conscious
of
that
pleasure
and
cultivated
it
and
took
care
that
we
had
our
fill
of
it
and
then
all
was
gained
and
we
were
happy
so
may
it
be
for
ages
and
ages
the
old
man
fell
into
a
reverie
not
altogether
without
melancholy
i
thought
but
i
would
not
break
it
suddenly
he
started
and
said
well
dear
guest
here
are
come
dick
and
clara
to
fetch
you
away
and
there
is
an
end
of
my
talk
which
i
daresay
you
will
not
be
sorry
for
the
long
day
is
coming
to
an
end
and
you
will
have
a
pleasant
ride
back
to
hammersmith
chapter
xix
the
drive
back
to
hammersmith
i
said
nothing
for
i
was
not
inclined
for
mere
politeness
to
him
after
such
very
serious
talk
but
in
fact
i
should
liked
to
have
gone
on
talking
with
the
older
man
who
could
understand
something
at
least
of
my
wonted
ways
of
looking
at
life
whereas
with
the
younger
people
in
spite
of
all
their
kindness
i
really
was
a
being
from
another
planet
however
i
made
the
best
of
it
and
smiled
as
amiably
as
i
could
on
the
young
couple
and
dick
returned
the
smile
by
saying
well
guest
i
am
glad
to
have
you
again
and
to
find
that
you
and
my
kinsman
have
not
quite
talked
yourselves
into
another
world
i
was
half
suspecting
as
i
was
listening
to
the
welshmen
yonder
that
you
would
presently
be
vanishing
away
from
us
and
began
to
picture
my
kinsman
sitting
in
the
hall
staring
at
nothing
and
finding
that
he
had
been
talking
a
while
past
to
nobody
i
felt
rather
uncomfortable
at
this
speech
for
suddenly
the
picture
of
the
sordid
squabble
the
dirty
and
miserable
tragedy
of
the
life
i
had
left
for
a
while
came
before
my
eyes
and
i
had
as
it
were
a
vision
of
all
my
longings
for
rest
and
peace
in
the
past
and
i
loathed
the
idea
of
going
back
to
it
again
but
the
old
man
chuckled
and
said
do
be
afraid
dick
in
any
case
i
have
not
been
talking
to
thin
air
nor
indeed
to
this
new
friend
of
ours
only
who
knows
but
i
may
not
have
been
talking
to
many
people
for
perhaps
our
guest
may
some
day
go
back
to
the
people
he
has
come
from
and
may
take
a
message
from
us
which
may
bear
fruit
for
them
and
consequently
for
us
dick
looked
puzzled
and
said
well
gaffer
i
do
not
quite
understand
what
you
mean
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
hope
he
will
not
leave
us
for
do
you
see
he
is
another
kind
of
man
to
what
we
are
used
to
and
somehow
he
makes
us
think
of
all
kind
of
things
and
already
i
feel
as
if
i
could
understand
dickens
the
better
for
having
talked
with
him
yes
said
clara
and
i
think
in
a
few
months
we
shall
make
him
look
younger
and
i
should
like
to
see
what
he
was
like
with
the
wrinkles
smoothed
out
of
his
face
do
you
think
he
will
look
younger
after
a
little
time
with
us
the
old
man
shook
his
head
and
looked
earnestly
at
me
but
did
not
answer
her
and
for
a
moment
or
two
we
were
all
silent
then
clara
broke
out
kinsman
i
do
like
this
something
or
another
troubles
me
and
i
feel
as
if
something
untoward
were
going
to
happen
you
have
been
talking
of
past
miseries
to
the
guest
and
have
been
living
in
past
unhappy
times
and
it
is
in
the
air
all
round
us
and
makes
us
feel
as
if
we
were
longing
for
something
that
we
can
not
have
the
old
man
smiled
on
her
kindly
and
said
well
my
child
if
that
be
so
go
and
live
in
the
present
and
you
will
soon
shake
it
off
then
he
turned
to
me
and
said
do
you
remember
anything
like
that
guest
in
the
country
from
which
you
come
the
lovers
had
turned
aside
now
and
were
talking
together
softly
and
not
heeding
us
so
i
said
but
in
a
low
voice
yes
when
i
was
a
happy
child
on
a
sunny
holiday
and
had
everything
that
i
could
think
of
so
it
is
said
he
you
remember
just
now
you
twitted
me
with
living
in
the
second
childhood
of
the
world
you
will
find
it
a
happy
world
to
live
in
you
will
be
happy
there
for
a
while
again
i
did
not
like
his
scarcely
veiled
threat
and
was
beginning
to
trouble
myself
with
trying
to
remember
how
i
had
got
amongst
this
curious
people
when
the
old
man
called
out
in
a
cheery
voice
now
my
children
take
your
guest
away
and
make
much
of
him
for
it
is
your
business
to
make
him
sleek
of
skin
and
peaceful
of
mind
he
has
by
no
means
been
as
lucky
as
you
have
farewell
guest
and
he
grasped
my
hand
warmly
said
i
and
thank
you
very
much
for
all
that
you
have
told
me
i
will
come
and
see
you
as
soon
as
i
come
back
to
london
may
i
yes
he
said
come
by
all
means
if
you
can
it
wo
be
for
some
time
yet
quoth
dick
in
his
cheery
voice
for
when
the
hay
is
in
up
the
river
i
shall
be
for
taking
him
a
round
through
the
country
between
hay
and
wheat
harvest
to
see
how
our
friends
live
in
the
north
country
then
in
the
wheat
harvest
we
shall
do
a
good
stroke
of
work
i
should
hope
in
wiltshire
by
preference
for
he
will
be
getting
a
little
hard
with
all
the
living
and
i
shall
be
as
tough
as
nails
but
you
will
take
me
along
wo
you
dick
said
clara
laying
her
pretty
hand
on
his
shoulder
will
i
not
said
dick
somewhat
boisterously
and
we
will
manage
to
send
you
to
bed
pretty
tired
every
night
and
you
will
look
so
beautiful
with
your
neck
all
brown
and
your
hands
too
and
you
under
your
gown
as
white
as
privet
that
you
will
get
some
of
those
strange
discontented
whims
out
of
your
head
my
dear
however
our
week
haymaking
will
do
all
that
for
you
the
girl
reddened
very
prettily
and
not
for
shame
but
for
pleasure
and
the
old
man
laughed
and
said
guest
i
see
that
you
will
be
as
comfortable
as
need
be
for
you
need
not
fear
that
those
two
will
be
too
officious
with
you
they
will
be
so
busy
with
each
other
that
they
will
leave
you
a
good
deal
to
yourself
i
am
sure
and
that
is
a
real
kindness
to
a
guest
after
all
o
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
being
one
too
many
either
it
is
just
what
these
birds
in
a
nest
like
to
have
a
good
convenient
friend
to
turn
to
so
that
they
may
relieve
the
ecstasies
of
love
with
the
solid
commonplace
of
friendship
besides
dick
and
much
more
clara
likes
a
little
talking
at
times
and
you
know
lovers
do
not
talk
unless
they
get
into
trouble
they
only
prattle
guest
may
you
be
happy
clara
went
up
to
old
hammond
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
kissed
him
heartily
and
said
you
are
a
dear
old
man
and
may
have
your
jest
about
me
as
much
as
you
please
and
it
wo
be
long
before
we
see
you
again
and
you
may
be
sure
we
shall
make
our
guest
happy
though
mind
you
there
is
some
truth
in
what
you
say
then
i
shook
hands
again
and
we
went
out
of
the
hall
and
into
the
cloisters
and
so
in
the
street
found
greylocks
in
the
shafts
waiting
for
us
he
was
well
looked
after
for
a
little
lad
of
about
seven
years
old
had
his
hand
on
the
rein
and
was
solemnly
looking
up
into
his
face
on
his
back
withal
was
a
girl
of
fourteen
holding
a
old
sister
on
before
her
while
another
girl
about
a
year
older
than
the
boy
hung
on
behind
the
three
were
occupied
partly
with
eating
cherries
partly
with
patting
and
punching
greylocks
who
took
all
their
caresses
in
good
part
but
pricked
up
his
ears
when
dick
made
his
appearance
the
girls
got
off
quietly
and
going
up
to
clara
made
much
of
her
and
snuggled
up
to
her
and
then
we
got
into
the
carriage
dick
shook
the
reins
and
we
got
under
way
at
once
greylocks
trotting
soberly
between
the
lovely
trees
of
the
london
streets
that
were
sending
floods
of
fragrance
into
the
cool
evening
air
for
it
was
now
getting
toward
sunset
we
could
hardly
go
but
fair
and
softly
all
the
way
as
there
were
a
great
many
people
abroad
in
that
cool
hour
seeing
so
many
people
made
me
notice
their
looks
the
more
and
i
must
say
my
taste
cultivated
in
the
sombre
greyness
or
rather
brownness
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
rather
apt
to
condemn
the
gaiety
and
brightness
of
the
raiment
and
i
even
ventured
to
say
as
much
to
clara
she
seemed
rather
surprised
and
even
slightly
indignant
and
said
well
well
what
the
matter
they
are
not
about
any
dirty
work
they
are
only
amusing
themselves
in
the
fine
evening
there
is
nothing
to
foul
their
clothes
come
does
it
all
look
very
pretty
it
is
gaudy
you
know
indeed
that
was
true
for
many
of
the
people
were
clad
in
colours
that
were
sober
enough
though
beautiful
and
the
harmony
of
the
colours
was
perfect
and
most
delightful
i
said
yes
that
is
so
but
how
can
everybody
afford
such
costly
garments
look
there
goes
a
man
in
a
sober
grey
dress
but
i
can
see
from
here
that
it
is
made
of
very
fine
woollen
stuff
and
is
covered
with
silk
embroidery
said
clara
he
could
wear
shabby
clothes
if
he
pleased
that
is
if
he
did
think
he
would
hurt
people
feelings
by
doing
so
but
please
tell
me
said
i
how
can
they
afford
it
as
soon
as
i
had
spoken
i
perceived
that
i
had
got
back
to
my
old
blunder
for
i
saw
dick
shoulders
shaking
with
laughter
but
he
would
say
a
word
but
handed
me
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
clara
who
said
why
i
do
know
what
you
mean
of
course
we
can
afford
it
or
else
we
should
do
it
it
would
be
easy
enough
for
us
to
say
we
will
only
spend
our
labour
on
making
our
clothes
comfortable
but
we
do
choose
to
stop
there
why
do
you
find
fault
with
us
does
it
seem
to
you
as
if
we
starved
ourselves
of
food
in
order
to
make
ourselves
fine
clothes
or
do
you
think
there
is
anything
wrong
in
liking
to
see
the
coverings
of
our
bodies
beautiful
like
our
bodies
are
just
as
a
deer
or
an
skin
has
been
made
beautiful
from
the
first
come
what
is
wrong
with
you
i
bowed
before
the
storm
and
mumbled
out
some
excuse
or
other
i
must
say
i
might
have
known
that
people
who
were
so
fond
of
architecture
generally
would
not
be
backward
in
ornamenting
themselves
all
the
more
as
the
shape
of
their
raiment
apart
from
its
colour
was
both
beautiful
and
reasonable
veiling
the
form
without
either
muffling
or
caricaturing
it
clara
was
soon
mollified
and
as
we
drove
along
toward
the
wood
before
mentioned
she
said
to
dick
i
tell
you
what
dick
now
that
kinsman
hammond
the
elder
has
seen
our
guest
in
his
queer
clothes
i
think
we
ought
to
find
him
something
decent
to
put
on
for
our
journey
especially
since
if
we
do
not
we
shall
have
to
answer
all
sorts
of
questions
as
to
his
clothes
and
where
they
came
from
besides
she
said
slily
when
he
is
clad
in
handsome
garments
he
will
not
be
so
quick
to
blame
us
for
our
childishness
in
wasting
our
time
in
making
ourselves
look
pleasant
to
each
other
all
right
clara
said
dick
he
shall
have
everything
that
you
that
he
wants
to
have
i
will
look
something
out
for
him
before
he
gets
up
morrow
chapter
xx
the
hammersmith
again
amidst
such
talk
driving
quietly
through
the
balmy
evening
we
came
to
hammersmith
and
were
well
received
by
our
friends
there
boffin
in
a
fresh
suit
of
clothes
welcomed
me
back
with
stately
courtesy
the
weaver
wanted
to
me
and
get
out
of
me
what
old
hammond
had
said
but
was
very
friendly
and
cheerful
when
dick
warned
him
off
annie
shook
hands
with
me
and
hoped
i
had
had
a
pleasant
day
so
kindly
that
i
felt
a
slight
pang
as
our
hands
parted
for
to
say
the
truth
i
liked
her
better
than
clara
who
seemed
to
be
always
a
little
on
the
defensive
whereas
annie
was
as
frank
as
could
be
and
seemed
to
get
honest
pleasure
from
everything
and
everybody
about
her
without
the
least
effort
we
had
quite
a
little
feast
that
evening
partly
in
my
honour
and
partly
i
suspect
though
nothing
was
said
about
it
in
honour
of
dick
and
clara
coming
together
again
the
wine
was
of
the
best
the
hall
was
redolent
of
rich
summer
flowers
and
after
supper
we
not
only
had
music
annie
to
my
mind
surpassing
all
the
others
for
sweetness
and
clearness
of
voice
as
well
as
for
feeling
and
meaning
but
at
last
we
even
got
to
telling
stories
and
sat
there
listening
with
no
other
light
but
that
of
the
summer
moon
streaming
through
the
beautiful
traceries
of
the
windows
as
if
we
had
belonged
to
time
long
passed
when
books
were
scarce
and
the
art
of
reading
somewhat
rare
indeed
i
may
say
here
that
though
as
you
will
have
noted
my
friends
had
mostly
something
to
say
about
books
yet
they
were
not
great
readers
considering
the
refinement
of
their
manners
and
the
great
amount
of
leisure
which
they
obviously
had
in
fact
when
dick
especially
mentioned
a
book
he
did
so
with
an
air
of
a
man
who
has
accomplished
an
achievement
as
much
as
to
say
there
you
see
i
have
actually
read
that
the
evening
passed
all
too
quickly
for
me
since
that
day
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
having
my
fill
of
the
pleasure
of
the
eyes
without
any
of
that
sense
of
incongruity
that
dread
of
approaching
ruin
which
had
always
beset
me
hitherto
when
i
had
been
amongst
the
beautiful
works
of
art
of
the
past
mingled
with
the
lovely
nature
of
the
present
both
of
them
in
fact
the
result
of
the
long
centuries
of
tradition
which
had
compelled
men
to
produce
the
art
and
compelled
nature
to
run
into
the
mould
of
the
ages
here
i
could
enjoy
everything
without
an
afterthought
of
the
injustice
and
miserable
toil
which
made
my
leisure
the
ignorance
and
dulness
of
life
which
went
to
make
my
keen
appreciation
of
history
the
tyranny
and
the
struggle
full
of
fear
and
mishap
which
went
to
make
my
romance
the
only
weight
i
had
upon
my
heart
was
a
vague
fear
as
it
drew
toward
concerning
the
place
wherein
i
should
wake
on
the
morrow
but
i
choked
that
down
and
went
to
bed
happy
and
in
a
very
few
moments
was
in
a
dreamless
sleep
chapter
xxi
going
up
the
river
when
i
did
wake
to
a
beautiful
sunny
morning
i
leapt
out
of
bed
with
my
apprehension
still
clinging
to
me
which
vanished
delightfully
however
in
a
moment
as
i
looked
around
my
little
sleeping
chamber
and
saw
the
pale
but
figures
painted
on
the
plaster
of
the
wall
with
verses
written
underneath
them
which
i
knew
somewhat
over
well
i
dressed
speedily
in
a
suit
of
blue
laid
ready
for
me
so
handsome
that
i
quite
blushed
when
i
had
got
into
it
feeling
as
i
did
so
that
excited
pleasure
of
anticipation
of
a
holiday
which
well
remembered
as
it
was
i
had
not
felt
since
i
was
a
boy
new
come
home
for
the
summer
holidays
it
seemed
quite
early
in
the
morning
and
i
expected
to
have
the
hall
to
myself
when
i
came
into
it
out
of
the
corridor
wherein
was
my
sleeping
chamber
but
i
met
annie
at
once
who
let
fall
her
broom
and
gave
me
a
kiss
quite
meaningless
i
fear
except
as
betokening
friendship
though
she
reddened
as
she
did
it
not
from
shyness
but
from
friendly
pleasure
and
then
stood
and
picked
up
her
broom
again
and
went
on
with
her
sweeping
nodding
to
me
as
if
to
bid
me
stand
out
of
the
way
and
look
on
which
to
say
the
truth
i
thought
amusing
enough
as
there
were
five
other
girls
helping
her
and
their
graceful
figures
engaged
in
the
leisurely
work
were
worth
going
a
long
way
to
see
and
their
merry
talk
and
laughing
as
they
swept
in
quite
a
scientific
manner
was
worth
going
a
long
way
to
hear
but
annie
presently
threw
me
back
a
word
or
two
as
she
went
on
to
the
other
end
of
the
hall
guest
she
said
i
am
glad
that
you
are
up
early
though
we
would
disturb
you
for
our
thames
is
a
lovely
river
at
six
on
a
june
morning
and
as
it
would
be
a
pity
for
you
to
lose
it
i
am
told
just
to
give
you
a
cup
of
milk
and
a
bit
of
bread
outside
there
and
put
you
into
the
boat
for
dick
and
clara
are
all
ready
now
wait
half
a
minute
till
i
have
swept
down
this
row
so
presently
she
let
her
broom
drop
again
and
came
and
took
me
by
the
hand
and
led
me
out
on
to
the
terrace
above
the
river
to
a
little
table
under
the
boughs
where
my
bread
and
milk
took
the
form
of
as
dainty
a
breakfast
as
any
one
could
desire
and
then
sat
by
me
as
i
ate
and
in
a
minute
or
two
dick
and
clara
came
to
me
the
latter
looking
most
fresh
and
beautiful
in
a
light
silk
embroidered
gown
which
to
my
unused
eyes
was
extravagantly
gay
and
bright
while
dick
was
also
handsomely
dressed
in
white
flannel
prettily
embroidered
clara
raised
her
gown
in
her
hands
as
she
gave
me
the
morning
greeting
and
said
laughingly
look
guest
you
see
we
are
at
least
as
fine
as
any
of
the
people
you
felt
inclined
to
scold
last
night
you
see
we
are
not
going
to
make
the
bright
day
and
the
flowers
feel
ashamed
of
themselves
now
scold
me
quoth
i
no
indeed
the
pair
of
you
seem
as
if
you
were
born
out
of
the
summer
day
itself
and
i
will
scold
you
when
i
scold
it
well
you
know
said
dick
this
is
a
special
day
all
these
days
are
i
mean
the
is
in
some
ways
better
than
because
of
the
beautiful
weather
and
really
unless
you
had
worked
in
the
field
in
fine
weather
you
could
tell
what
pleasant
work
it
is
the
women
look
so
pretty
at
it
too
he
said
shyly
so
all
things
considered
i
think
we
are
right
to
adorn
it
in
a
simple
manner
do
the
women
work
at
it
in
silk
dresses
said
i
smiling
dick
was
going
to
answer
me
soberly
but
clara
put
her
hand
over
his
mouth
and
said
no
no
dick
not
too
much
information
for
him
or
i
shall
think
that
you
are
your
old
kinsman
again
let
him
find
out
for
himself
he
will
not
have
long
to
wait
yes
quoth
annie
do
make
your
description
of
the
picture
too
fine
or
else
he
will
be
disappointed
when
the
curtain
is
drawn
i
do
want
him
to
be
disappointed
but
now
it
time
for
you
to
be
gone
if
you
are
to
have
the
best
of
the
tide
and
also
of
the
sunny
morning
guest
she
kissed
me
in
her
frank
friendly
way
and
almost
took
away
from
me
my
desire
for
the
expedition
thereby
but
i
had
to
get
over
that
as
it
was
clear
that
so
delightful
a
woman
would
hardly
be
without
a
due
lover
of
her
own
age
we
went
down
the
steps
of
the
landing
stage
and
got
into
a
pretty
boat
not
too
light
to
hold
us
and
our
belongings
comfortably
and
handsomely
ornamented
and
just
as
we
got
in
down
came
boffin
and
the
weaver
to
see
us
off
the
former
had
now
veiled
his
splendour
in
a
due
suit
of
working
clothes
crowned
with
a
fantail
hat
which
he
took
off
however
to
wave
us
farewell
with
his
grave
courtesy
then
dick
pushed
off
into
the
stream
and
bent
vigorously
to
his
sculls
and
hammersmith
with
its
noble
trees
and
beautiful
houses
began
to
slip
away
from
us
as
we
went
i
could
not
help
putting
beside
his
promised
picture
of
the
as
it
was
then
the
picture
of
it
as
i
remembered
it
and
especially
the
images
of
the
women
engaged
in
the
work
rose
up
before
me
the
row
of
gaunt
figures
lean
ugly
without
a
grace
of
form
or
face
about
them
dressed
in
wretched
skimpy
print
gowns
and
hideous
flapping
moving
their
rakes
in
a
listless
mechanical
way
how
often
had
that
marred
the
loveliness
of
the
june
day
to
me
how
often
had
i
longed
to
see
the
peopled
with
men
and
women
worthy
of
the
sweet
abundance
of
midsummer
of
its
endless
wealth
of
beautiful
sights
and
delicious
sounds
and
scents
and
now
the
world
had
grown
old
and
wiser
and
i
was
to
see
my
hope
realised
at
last
chapter
xxii
hampton
court
and
a
praiser
of
past
times
so
on
we
went
dick
rowing
in
an
easy
tireless
way
and
clara
sitting
by
my
side
admiring
his
manly
beauty
and
heartily
face
and
thinking
i
fancy
of
nothing
else
as
we
went
higher
up
the
river
there
was
less
difference
between
the
thames
of
that
day
and
thames
as
i
remembered
it
for
setting
aside
the
hideous
vulgarity
of
the
cockney
villas
of
the
stockbrokers
and
other
such
which
in
older
time
marred
the
beauty
of
the
banks
even
this
beginning
of
the
country
thames
was
always
beautiful
and
as
we
slipped
between
the
lovely
summer
greenery
i
almost
felt
my
youth
come
back
to
me
and
as
if
i
were
on
one
of
those
water
excursions
which
i
used
to
enjoy
so
much
in
days
when
i
was
too
happy
to
think
that
there
could
be
much
amiss
anywhere
at
last
we
came
to
a
reach
of
the
river
where
on
the
left
hand
a
very
pretty
little
village
with
some
old
houses
in
it
came
down
to
the
edge
of
the
water
over
which
was
a
ferry
and
beyond
these
houses
the
meadows
ended
in
a
fringe
of
tall
willows
while
on
the
right
hand
went
the
and
a
clear
space
before
a
row
of
trees
which
rose
up
behind
huge
and
ancient
the
ornaments
of
a
great
park
but
these
drew
back
still
further
from
the
river
at
the
end
of
the
reach
to
make
way
for
a
little
town
of
quaint
and
pretty
houses
some
new
some
old
dominated
by
the
long
walls
and
sharp
gables
of
a
great
pile
of
building
partly
of
the
latest
gothic
partly
of
the
of
dutch
william
but
so
blended
together
by
the
bright
sun
and
beautiful
surroundings
including
the
bright
blue
river
which
it
looked
down
upon
that
even
amidst
the
beautiful
buildings
of
that
new
happy
time
it
had
a
strange
charm
about
it
a
great
wave
of
fragrance
amidst
which
the
blossom
was
clearly
to
be
distinguished
came
down
to
us
from
its
unseen
gardens
as
clara
sat
up
in
her
place
and
said
o
dick
dear
could
we
stop
at
hampton
court
for
and
take
the
guest
about
the
park
a
little
and
show
him
those
sweet
old
buildings
somehow
i
suppose
because
you
have
lived
so
near
it
you
have
seldom
taken
me
to
hampton
court
dick
rested
on
his
oars
a
little
and
said
well
well
clara
you
are
lazy
i
did
feel
like
stopping
short
of
shepperton
for
the
night
suppose
we
just
go
and
have
our
dinner
at
the
court
and
go
on
again
about
five
well
she
said
so
be
it
but
i
should
like
the
guest
to
have
spent
an
hour
or
two
in
the
park
the
park
said
dick
why
the
whole
is
a
park
this
time
of
the
year
and
for
my
part
i
had
rather
lie
under
an
on
the
borders
of
a
with
the
bees
humming
about
me
and
the
crake
crying
from
furrow
to
furrow
than
in
any
park
in
england
besides
besides
said
she
you
want
to
get
on
to
your
upper
thames
and
show
your
prowess
down
the
heavy
swathes
of
the
mowing
grass
she
looked
at
him
fondly
and
i
could
tell
that
she
was
seeing
him
in
her
mind
eye
showing
his
splendid
form
at
its
best
amidst
the
rhymed
strokes
of
the
scythes
and
she
looked
down
at
her
own
pretty
feet
with
a
half
sigh
as
though
she
were
contrasting
her
slight
woman
beauty
with
his
man
beauty
as
women
will
when
they
are
really
in
love
and
are
not
spoiled
with
conventional
sentiment
as
for
dick
he
looked
at
her
admiringly
a
while
and
then
said
at
last
well
clara
i
do
wish
we
were
there
but
hilloa
we
are
getting
back
way
and
he
set
to
work
sculling
again
and
in
two
minutes
we
were
all
standing
on
the
gravelly
strand
below
the
bridge
which
as
you
may
imagine
was
no
longer
the
old
hideous
iron
abortion
but
a
handsome
piece
of
very
solid
oak
framing
we
went
into
the
court
and
straight
into
the
great
hall
so
well
remembered
where
there
were
tables
spread
for
dinner
and
everything
arranged
much
as
in
hammersmith
dinner
over
we
sauntered
through
the
ancient
rooms
where
the
pictures
and
tapestry
were
still
preserved
and
nothing
was
much
changed
except
that
the
people
whom
we
met
there
had
an
indefinable
kind
of
look
of
being
at
home
and
at
ease
which
communicated
itself
to
me
so
that
i
felt
that
the
beautiful
old
place
was
mine
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
and
my
pleasure
of
past
days
seemed
to
add
itself
to
that
of
and
filled
my
whole
soul
with
content
dick
who
in
spite
of
clara
gibe
knew
the
place
very
well
told
me
that
the
beautiful
old
tudor
rooms
which
i
remembered
had
been
the
dwellings
of
the
lesser
fry
of
court
flunkies
were
now
much
used
by
people
coming
and
going
for
beautiful
as
architecture
had
now
become
and
although
the
whole
face
of
the
country
had
quite
recovered
its
beauty
there
was
still
a
sort
of
tradition
of
pleasure
and
beauty
which
clung
to
that
group
of
buildings
and
people
thought
going
to
hampton
court
a
necessary
summer
outing
as
they
did
in
the
days
when
london
was
so
grimy
and
miserable
we
went
into
some
of
the
rooms
looking
into
the
old
garden
and
were
well
received
by
the
people
in
them
who
got
speedily
into
talk
with
us
and
looked
with
politely
wonder
at
my
strange
face
besides
these
birds
of
passage
and
a
few
regular
dwellers
in
the
place
we
saw
out
in
the
meadows
near
the
garden
down
the
long
water
as
it
used
to
be
called
many
gay
tents
with
men
women
and
children
round
about
them
as
it
seemed
this
people
were
fond
of
with
all
its
inconveniences
which
indeed
they
turned
into
pleasure
also
we
left
this
old
friend
by
the
time
appointed
and
i
made
some
feeble
show
of
taking
the
sculls
but
dick
repulsed
me
not
much
to
my
grief
i
must
say
as
i
found
i
had
quite
enough
to
do
between
the
enjoyment
of
the
beautiful
time
and
my
own
lazily
blended
thoughts
as
to
dick
it
was
quite
right
to
let
him
pull
for
he
was
as
strong
as
a
horse
and
had
the
greatest
delight
in
bodily
exercise
whatever
it
was
we
really
had
some
difficulty
in
getting
him
to
stop
when
it
was
getting
rather
more
than
dusk
and
the
moon
was
brightening
just
as
we
were
off
runnymede
we
landed
there
and
were
looking
about
for
a
place
whereon
to
pitch
our
tents
for
we
had
brought
two
with
us
when
an
old
man
came
up
to
us
bade
us
good
evening
and
asked
if
we
were
housed
for
that
that
night
and
finding
that
we
were
not
bade
us
home
to
his
house
nothing
loth
we
went
with
him
and
clara
took
his
hand
in
a
coaxing
way
which
i
noticed
she
used
with
old
men
and
as
we
went
on
our
way
made
some
commonplace
remark
about
the
beauty
of
the
day
the
old
man
stopped
short
and
looked
at
her
and
said
you
really
like
it
then
yes
she
said
looking
very
much
astonished
do
you
well
said
he
perhaps
i
do
i
did
at
any
rate
when
i
was
younger
but
now
i
think
i
should
like
it
cooler
she
said
nothing
and
went
on
the
night
growing
about
as
dark
as
it
would
be
till
just
at
the
rise
of
the
hill
we
came
to
a
hedge
with
a
gate
in
it
which
the
old
man
unlatched
and
led
us
into
a
garden
at
the
end
of
which
we
could
see
a
little
house
one
of
whose
little
windows
was
already
yellow
with
candlelight
we
could
see
even
under
the
doubtful
light
of
the
moon
and
the
last
of
the
western
glow
that
the
garden
was
stuffed
full
of
flowers
and
the
fragrance
it
gave
out
in
the
gathering
coolness
was
so
wonderfully
sweet
that
it
seemed
the
very
heart
of
the
delight
of
the
june
dusk
so
that
we
three
stopped
instinctively
and
clara
gave
forth
a
little
sweet
o
like
a
bird
beginning
to
sing
what
the
matter
said
the
old
man
a
little
testily
and
pulling
at
her
hand
there
no
dog
or
have
you
trodden
on
a
thorn
and
hurt
your
foot
no
no
neighbour
she
said
but
how
sweet
how
sweet
it
is
of
course
it
is
said
he
but
do
you
care
so
much
for
that
she
laughed
out
musically
and
we
followed
suit
in
our
gruffer
voices
and
then
she
said
of
course
i
do
neighbour
do
you
well
i
do
know
quoth
the
old
fellow
then
he
added
as
if
somewhat
ashamed
of
himself
besides
you
know
when
the
waters
are
out
and
all
runnymede
is
flooded
it
none
so
pleasant
should
like
it
quoth
dick
what
a
jolly
sail
one
would
get
about
here
on
the
floods
on
a
bright
frosty
january
morning
you
like
it
said
our
host
well
i
wo
argue
with
you
neighbour
it
is
worth
while
come
in
and
have
some
supper
we
went
up
a
paved
path
between
the
roses
and
straight
into
a
very
pretty
room
panelled
and
carved
and
as
clean
as
a
new
pin
but
the
chief
ornament
of
which
was
a
young
woman
and
but
with
her
face
and
hands
and
bare
feet
tanned
quite
brown
with
the
sun
though
she
was
very
lightly
clad
that
was
clearly
from
choice
not
from
poverty
though
these
were
the
first
i
had
come
across
for
her
gown
was
of
silk
and
on
her
wrists
were
bracelets
that
seemed
to
me
of
great
value
she
was
lying
on
a
near
the
window
but
jumped
up
as
soon
as
we
entered
and
when
she
saw
the
guests
behind
the
old
man
she
clapped
her
hands
and
cried
out
with
pleasure
and
when
she
got
us
into
the
middle
of
the
room
fairly
danced
round
us
in
delight
of
our
company
what
said
the
old
man
you
are
pleased
are
you
ellen
the
girl
danced
up
to
him
and
threw
her
arms
round
him
and
said
yes
i
am
and
so
ought
you
to
be
grandfather
well
well
i
am
said
he
as
much
as
i
can
be
pleased
guests
please
be
seated
this
seemed
rather
strange
to
us
stranger
i
suspect
to
my
friends
than
to
me
but
dick
took
the
opportunity
of
both
the
host
and
his
being
out
of
the
room
to
say
to
me
softly
a
grumbler
there
are
a
few
of
them
still
once
upon
a
time
i
am
told
they
were
quite
a
nuisance
the
old
man
came
in
as
he
spoke
and
sat
down
beside
us
with
a
sigh
which
indeed
seemed
fetched
up
as
if
he
wanted
us
to
take
notice
of
it
but
just
then
the
girl
came
in
with
the
victuals
and
the
carle
missed
his
mark
what
between
our
hunger
generally
and
that
i
was
pretty
busy
watching
the
moving
about
as
beautiful
as
a
picture
everything
to
eat
and
drink
though
it
was
somewhat
different
to
what
we
had
had
in
london
was
better
than
good
but
the
old
man
eyed
rather
sulkily
the
chief
dish
on
the
table
on
which
lay
a
leash
of
fine
perch
and
said
h
perch
i
am
sorry
we
ca
do
better
for
you
guests
the
time
was
when
we
might
have
had
a
good
piece
of
salmon
up
from
london
for
you
but
the
times
have
grown
mean
and
petty
yes
but
you
might
have
had
it
now
said
the
girl
giggling
if
you
had
known
that
they
were
coming
it
our
fault
for
not
bringing
it
with
us
neighbours
said
dick
humouredly
but
if
the
times
have
grown
petty
at
any
rate
the
perch
have
that
fellow
in
the
middle
there
must
have
weighed
a
good
two
pounds
when
he
was
showing
his
dark
stripes
and
red
fins
to
the
minnows
yonder
and
as
to
the
salmon
why
neighbour
my
friend
here
who
comes
from
the
outlands
was
quite
surprised
yesterday
morning
when
i
told
him
we
had
plenty
of
salmon
at
hammersmith
i
am
sure
i
have
heard
nothing
of
the
times
worsening
he
looked
a
little
uncomfortable
and
the
old
man
turning
to
me
said
very
courteously
well
sir
i
am
happy
to
see
a
man
from
over
the
water
but
i
really
must
appeal
to
you
to
say
whether
on
the
whole
you
are
not
better
off
in
your
country
where
i
suppose
from
what
our
guest
says
you
are
brisker
and
more
alive
because
you
have
not
wholly
got
rid
of
competition
you
see
i
have
read
not
a
few
books
of
the
past
days
and
certainly
are
much
more
alive
than
those
which
are
written
now
and
good
sound
unlimited
competition
was
the
condition
under
which
they
were
written
if
we
did
know
that
from
the
record
of
history
we
should
know
it
from
the
books
themselves
there
is
a
spirit
of
adventure
in
them
and
signs
of
a
capacity
to
extract
good
out
of
evil
which
our
literature
quite
lacks
now
and
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
our
moralists
and
historians
exaggerate
hugely
the
unhappiness
of
the
past
days
in
which
such
splendid
works
of
imagination
and
intellect
were
produced
clara
listened
to
him
with
restless
eyes
as
if
she
were
excited
and
pleased
dick
knitted
his
brow
and
looked
still
more
uncomfortable
but
said
nothing
indeed
the
old
man
gradually
as
he
warmed
to
his
subject
dropped
his
sneering
manner
and
both
spoke
and
looked
very
seriously
but
the
girl
broke
out
before
i
could
deliver
myself
of
the
answer
i
was
framing
books
books
always
books
grandfather
when
will
you
understand
that
after
all
it
is
the
world
we
live
in
which
interests
us
the
world
of
which
we
are
a
part
and
which
we
can
never
love
too
much
look
she
said
throwing
open
the
casement
wider
and
showing
us
the
white
light
sparkling
between
the
black
shadows
of
the
moonlit
garden
through
which
ran
a
little
shiver
of
the
summer
look
these
are
our
books
in
these
days
and
these
she
said
stepping
lightly
up
to
the
two
lovers
and
laying
a
hand
on
each
of
their
shoulders
and
the
guest
there
with
his
knowledge
and
experience
yes
and
even
you
grandfather
a
smile
ran
over
her
face
as
she
spoke
with
all
your
grumbling
and
wishing
yourself
back
again
in
the
good
old
days
in
which
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
a
harmless
and
lazy
old
man
like
you
would
either
have
pretty
nearly
starved
or
have
had
to
pay
soldiers
and
people
to
take
the
folk
victuals
and
clothes
and
houses
away
from
them
by
force
yes
these
are
our
books
and
if
we
want
more
can
we
not
find
work
to
do
in
the
beautiful
buildings
that
we
raise
up
all
over
the
country
and
i
know
there
was
nothing
like
them
in
past
times
wherein
a
man
can
put
forth
whatever
is
in
him
and
make
his
hands
set
forth
his
mind
and
his
soul
she
paused
a
little
and
i
for
my
part
could
not
help
staring
at
her
and
thinking
that
if
she
were
a
book
the
pictures
in
it
were
most
lovely
the
colour
mantled
in
her
delicate
sunburnt
cheeks
her
grey
eyes
light
amidst
the
tan
of
her
face
kindly
looked
on
us
all
as
she
spoke
she
paused
and
said
again
as
for
your
books
they
were
well
enough
for
times
when
intelligent
people
had
but
little
else
in
which
they
could
take
pleasure
and
when
they
must
needs
supplement
the
sordid
miseries
of
their
own
lives
with
imaginations
of
the
lives
of
other
people
but
i
say
flatly
that
in
spite
of
all
their
cleverness
and
vigour
and
capacity
for
there
is
something
loathsome
about
them
some
of
them
indeed
do
here
and
there
show
some
feeling
for
those
whom
the
call
and
of
the
misery
of
whose
lives
we
have
some
inkling
but
presently
they
give
it
up
and
towards
the
end
of
the
story
we
must
be
contented
to
see
the
hero
and
heroine
living
happily
in
an
island
of
bliss
on
other
people
troubles
and
that
after
a
long
series
of
sham
troubles
or
mostly
sham
of
their
own
making
illustrated
by
dreary
introspective
nonsense
about
their
feelings
and
aspirations
and
all
the
rest
of
it
while
the
world
must
even
then
have
gone
on
its
way
and
dug
and
sewed
and
baked
and
built
and
carpentered
round
about
these
useless
animals
there
said
the
old
man
reverting
to
his
dry
sulky
manner
again
there
eloquence
i
suppose
you
like
it
yes
said
i
very
emphatically
well
said
he
now
the
storm
of
eloquence
has
lulled
for
a
little
suppose
you
answer
my
question
that
is
if
you
like
you
know
quoth
he
with
a
sudden
access
of
courtesy
what
question
said
i
for
i
must
confess
that
ellen
strange
and
almost
wild
beauty
had
put
it
out
of
my
head
said
he
first
of
all
excuse
my
catechising
is
there
competition
in
life
after
the
old
kind
in
the
country
whence
you
come
yes
said
i
it
is
the
rule
there
and
i
wondered
as
i
spoke
what
fresh
complications
i
should
get
into
as
a
result
of
this
answer
question
two
said
the
carle
are
you
not
on
the
whole
much
freer
more
energetic
in
a
word
healthier
and
happier
for
it
i
smiled
you
would
talk
so
if
you
had
any
idea
of
our
life
to
me
you
seem
here
as
if
you
were
living
in
heaven
compared
with
us
of
the
country
from
which
i
came
heaven
said
he
you
like
heaven
do
you
yes
said
i
snappishly
i
am
afraid
for
i
was
beginning
rather
to
resent
his
formula
well
i
am
far
from
sure
that
i
do
quoth
he
i
think
one
may
do
more
with
one
life
than
sitting
on
a
damp
cloud
and
singing
hymns
i
was
rather
nettled
by
this
inconsequence
and
said
well
neighbour
to
be
short
and
without
using
metaphors
in
the
land
whence
i
come
where
the
competition
which
produced
those
literary
works
which
you
admire
so
much
is
still
the
rule
most
people
are
thoroughly
unhappy
here
to
me
at
least
most
people
seem
thoroughly
happy
no
offence
guest
no
offence
said
he
but
let
me
ask
you
you
like
that
do
you
his
formula
put
with
such
obstinate
persistence
made
us
all
laugh
heartily
and
even
the
old
man
joined
in
the
laughter
on
the
sly
however
he
was
by
no
means
beaten
and
said
presently
from
all
i
can
hear
i
should
judge
that
a
young
woman
so
beautiful
as
my
dear
ellen
yonder
would
have
been
a
lady
as
they
called
it
in
the
old
time
and
would
have
had
to
wear
a
few
rags
of
silk
as
she
does
now
or
to
have
browned
herself
in
the
sun
as
she
has
to
do
now
what
do
you
say
to
that
eh
here
clara
who
had
been
pretty
much
silent
hitherto
struck
in
and
said
well
really
i
do
think
that
you
would
have
mended
matters
or
that
they
want
mending
do
you
see
that
she
is
dressed
deliciously
for
this
beautiful
weather
and
as
for
the
of
your
why
i
hope
to
pick
up
some
of
that
for
myself
when
we
get
a
little
higher
up
the
river
look
if
i
do
need
a
little
sun
on
my
pasty
white
skin
and
she
stripped
up
the
sleeve
from
her
arm
and
laid
it
beside
who
was
now
sitting
next
her
to
say
the
truth
it
was
rather
amusing
to
me
to
see
clara
putting
herself
forward
as
a
fine
lady
for
she
was
as
and
a
girl
as
might
be
met
with
anywhere
at
the
best
dick
stroked
the
beautiful
arm
rather
shyly
and
pulled
down
the
sleeve
again
while
she
blushed
at
his
touch
and
the
old
man
said
laughingly
well
i
suppose
you
like
that
do
you
ellen
kissed
her
new
friend
and
we
all
sat
silent
for
a
little
till
she
broke
out
into
a
sweet
shrill
song
and
held
us
all
entranced
with
the
wonder
of
her
clear
voice
and
the
old
grumbler
sat
looking
at
her
lovingly
the
other
young
people
sang
also
in
due
time
and
then
ellen
showed
us
to
our
beds
in
small
cottage
chambers
fragrant
and
clean
as
the
ideal
of
the
old
pastoral
poets
and
the
pleasure
of
the
evening
quite
extinguished
my
fear
of
the
last
night
that
i
should
wake
up
in
the
old
miserable
world
of
pleasures
and
hopes
that
were
half
fears
chapter
xxiii
an
early
morning
by
runnymede
though
there
were
no
rough
noises
to
wake
me
i
could
not
lie
long
abed
the
next
morning
where
the
world
seemed
so
well
awake
and
despite
the
old
grumbler
so
happy
so
i
got
up
and
found
that
early
as
it
was
someone
had
been
stirring
since
all
was
trim
and
in
its
place
in
the
little
parlour
and
the
table
laid
for
the
morning
meal
nobody
was
afoot
in
the
house
as
then
however
so
i
went
out
and
after
a
turn
or
two
round
the
superabundant
garden
i
wandered
down
over
the
meadow
to
the
where
lay
our
boat
looking
quite
familiar
and
friendly
to
me
i
walked
up
stream
a
little
watching
the
light
mist
curling
up
from
the
river
till
the
sun
gained
power
to
draw
it
all
away
saw
the
bleak
speckling
the
water
under
the
willow
boughs
whence
the
tiny
flies
they
fed
on
were
falling
in
myriads
heard
the
great
chub
splashing
here
and
there
at
some
belated
moth
or
other
and
felt
almost
back
again
in
my
boyhood
then
i
went
back
again
to
the
boat
and
loitered
there
a
minute
or
two
and
then
walked
slowly
up
the
meadow
towards
the
little
house
i
noted
now
that
there
were
four
more
houses
of
about
the
same
size
on
the
slope
away
from
the
river
the
meadow
in
which
i
was
going
was
not
up
for
hay
but
a
row
of
ran
up
the
slope
not
far
from
me
on
each
side
and
in
the
field
so
parted
off
from
ours
on
the
left
they
were
making
hay
busily
by
now
in
the
simple
fashion
of
the
days
when
i
was
a
boy
my
feet
turned
that
way
instinctively
as
i
wanted
to
see
how
haymakers
looked
in
these
new
and
better
times
and
also
i
rather
expected
to
see
ellen
there
i
came
to
the
hurdles
and
stood
looking
over
into
the
and
was
close
to
the
end
of
the
long
line
of
haymakers
who
were
spreading
the
low
ridges
to
dry
off
the
night
dew
the
majority
of
these
were
young
women
clad
much
like
ellen
last
night
though
not
mostly
in
silk
but
in
light
woollen
mostly
gaily
embroidered
the
men
being
all
clad
in
white
flannel
embroidered
in
bright
colours
the
meadow
looked
like
a
gigantic
bed
because
of
them
all
hands
were
working
deliberately
but
well
and
steadily
though
they
were
as
noisy
with
merry
talk
as
a
grove
of
autumn
starlings
half
a
dozen
of
them
men
and
women
came
up
to
me
and
shook
hands
gave
me
the
sele
of
the
morning
and
asked
a
few
questions
as
to
whence
and
whither
and
wishing
me
good
luck
went
back
to
their
work
ellen
to
my
disappointment
was
not
amongst
them
but
presently
i
saw
a
light
figure
come
out
of
the
higher
up
the
slope
and
make
for
our
house
and
that
was
ellen
holding
a
basket
in
her
hand
but
before
she
had
come
to
the
garden
gate
out
came
dick
and
clara
who
after
a
minute
pause
came
down
to
meet
me
leaving
ellen
in
the
garden
then
we
three
went
down
to
the
boat
talking
mere
morning
prattle
we
stayed
there
a
little
dick
arranging
some
of
the
matters
in
her
for
we
had
only
taken
up
to
the
house
such
things
as
we
thought
the
dew
might
damage
and
then
we
went
toward
the
house
again
but
when
we
came
near
the
garden
dick
stopped
us
by
laying
a
hand
on
my
arm
and
said
just
look
a
moment
i
looked
and
over
the
low
hedge
saw
ellen
shading
her
eyes
against
the
sun
as
she
looked
toward
the
a
light
wind
stirring
in
her
tawny
hair
her
eyes
like
light
jewels
amidst
her
sunburnt
face
which
looked
as
if
the
warmth
of
the
sun
were
yet
in
it
look
guest
said
dick
does
it
all
look
like
one
of
those
very
stories
out
of
grimm
that
we
were
talking
about
up
in
bloomsbury
here
are
we
two
lovers
wandering
about
the
world
and
we
have
come
to
a
fairy
garden
and
there
is
the
very
fairy
herself
amidst
of
it
i
wonder
what
she
will
do
for
us
said
clara
demurely
but
not
stiffly
is
she
a
good
fairy
dick
o
yes
said
he
and
according
to
the
card
she
would
do
better
if
it
were
not
for
the
gnome
or
our
grumbling
friend
of
last
night
we
laughed
at
this
and
i
said
i
hope
you
see
that
you
have
left
me
out
of
the
tale
well
said
he
that
true
you
had
better
consider
that
you
have
got
the
cap
of
darkness
and
are
seeing
everything
yourself
invisible
that
touched
me
on
my
weak
side
of
not
feeling
sure
of
my
position
in
this
beautiful
new
country
so
in
order
not
to
make
matters
worse
i
held
my
tongue
and
we
all
went
into
the
garden
and
up
to
the
house
together
i
noticed
by
the
way
that
clara
must
really
rather
have
felt
the
contrast
between
herself
as
a
town
madam
and
this
piece
of
the
summer
country
that
we
all
admired
so
for
she
had
rather
dressed
after
ellen
that
morning
as
to
thinness
and
scantiness
and
went
barefoot
also
except
for
light
sandals
the
old
man
greeted
us
kindly
in
the
parlour
and
said
well
guests
so
you
have
been
looking
about
to
search
into
the
nakedness
of
the
land
i
suppose
your
illusions
of
last
night
have
given
way
a
bit
before
the
morning
light
do
you
still
like
it
eh
very
much
said
i
doggedly
it
is
one
of
the
prettiest
places
on
the
lower
thames
oho
said
he
so
you
know
the
thames
do
you
i
reddened
for
i
saw
dick
and
clara
looking
at
me
and
scarcely
knew
what
to
say
however
since
i
had
said
in
our
early
intercourse
with
my
hammersmith
friends
that
i
had
known
epping
forest
i
thought
a
hasty
generalisation
might
be
better
in
avoiding
complications
than
a
downright
lie
so
i
said
i
have
been
in
this
country
before
and
i
have
been
on
the
thames
in
those
days
o
said
the
old
man
eagerly
so
you
have
been
in
this
country
before
now
really
do
you
it
apart
from
all
theory
you
know
much
changed
for
the
worse
no
not
at
all
said
i
i
find
it
much
changed
for
the
better
ah
quoth
he
i
fear
that
you
have
been
prejudiced
by
some
theory
or
another
however
of
course
the
time
when
you
were
here
before
must
have
been
so
near
our
own
days
that
the
deterioration
might
not
be
very
great
as
then
we
were
of
course
still
living
under
the
same
customs
as
we
are
now
i
was
thinking
of
earlier
days
than
that
in
short
said
clara
you
have
about
the
change
which
has
taken
place
i
have
facts
as
well
said
he
look
here
from
this
hill
you
can
see
just
four
little
houses
including
this
one
well
i
know
for
certain
that
in
old
times
even
in
the
summer
when
the
leaves
were
thickest
you
could
see
from
the
same
place
six
quite
big
and
fine
houses
and
higher
up
the
water
garden
joined
garden
right
up
to
windsor
and
there
were
big
houses
in
all
the
gardens
ah
england
was
an
important
place
in
those
days
i
was
getting
nettled
and
said
what
you
mean
is
that
you
the
place
and
sent
the
damned
flunkies
packing
and
that
everybody
can
live
comfortably
and
happily
and
not
a
few
damned
thieves
only
who
were
centres
of
vulgarity
and
corruption
wherever
they
were
and
who
as
to
this
lovely
river
destroyed
its
beauty
morally
and
had
almost
destroyed
it
physically
when
they
were
thrown
out
of
it
there
was
silence
after
this
outburst
which
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
help
remembering
how
i
had
suffered
from
cockneyism
and
its
cause
on
those
same
waters
of
old
time
but
at
last
the
old
man
said
quite
coolly
my
dear
guest
i
really
do
know
what
you
mean
by
either
cockneys
or
flunkies
or
thieves
or
damned
or
how
only
a
few
people
could
live
happily
and
comfortably
in
a
wealthy
country
all
i
can
see
is
that
you
are
angry
and
i
fear
with
me
so
if
you
like
we
will
change
the
subject
i
thought
this
kind
and
hospitable
in
him
considering
his
obstinacy
about
his
theory
and
hastened
to
say
that
i
did
not
mean
to
be
angry
only
emphatic
he
bowed
gravely
and
i
thought
the
storm
was
over
when
suddenly
ellen
broke
in
grandfather
our
guest
is
reticent
from
courtesy
but
really
what
he
has
in
his
mind
to
say
to
you
ought
to
be
said
so
as
i
know
pretty
well
what
it
is
i
will
say
it
for
him
for
as
you
know
i
have
been
taught
these
things
by
people
who
yes
said
the
old
man
by
the
sage
of
bloomsbury
and
others
o
said
dick
so
you
know
my
old
kinsman
hammond
yes
said
she
and
other
people
too
as
my
grandfather
says
and
they
have
taught
me
things
and
this
is
the
upshot
of
it
we
live
in
a
little
house
now
not
because
we
have
nothing
grander
to
do
than
working
in
the
fields
but
because
we
please
for
if
we
liked
we
could
go
and
live
in
a
big
house
amongst
pleasant
companions
grumbled
the
old
man
just
so
as
if
i
would
live
amongst
those
conceited
fellows
all
of
them
looking
down
upon
me
she
smiled
on
him
kindly
but
went
on
as
if
he
had
not
spoken
in
the
past
times
when
those
big
houses
of
which
grandfather
speaks
were
so
plenty
we
have
lived
in
a
cottage
whether
we
had
liked
it
or
not
and
the
said
cottage
instead
of
having
in
it
everything
we
want
would
have
been
bare
and
empty
we
should
not
have
got
enough
to
eat
our
clothes
would
have
been
ugly
to
look
at
dirty
and
frowsy
you
grandfather
have
done
no
hard
work
for
years
now
but
wander
about
and
read
your
books
and
have
nothing
to
worry
you
and
as
for
me
i
work
hard
when
i
like
it
because
i
like
it
and
think
it
does
me
good
and
knits
up
my
muscles
and
makes
me
prettier
to
look
at
and
healthier
and
happier
but
in
those
past
days
you
grandfather
would
have
had
to
work
hard
after
you
were
old
and
would
have
been
always
afraid
of
having
to
be
shut
up
in
a
kind
of
prison
along
with
other
old
men
and
without
amusement
and
as
for
me
i
am
twenty
years
old
in
those
days
my
middle
age
would
be
beginning
now
and
in
a
few
years
i
should
be
pinched
thin
and
haggard
beset
with
troubles
and
miseries
so
that
no
one
could
have
guessed
that
i
was
once
a
beautiful
girl
is
this
what
you
have
had
in
your
mind
guest
said
she
the
tears
in
her
eyes
at
thought
of
the
past
miseries
of
people
like
herself
yes
said
i
much
moved
that
and
more
often
in
my
country
i
have
seen
that
wretched
change
you
have
spoken
of
from
the
fresh
handsome
country
lass
to
the
poor
country
woman
the
old
man
sat
silent
for
a
little
but
presently
recovered
himself
and
took
comfort
in
his
old
phrase
of
well
you
like
it
so
do
you
yes
said
ellen
i
love
life
better
than
death
o
you
do
do
you
said
he
well
for
my
part
i
like
reading
a
good
old
book
with
plenty
of
fun
in
it
like
thackeray
fair
why
do
you
write
books
like
that
now
ask
that
question
of
your
bloomsbury
sage
seeing
dick
cheeks
reddening
a
little
at
this
sally
and
noting
that
silence
followed
i
thought
i
had
better
do
something
so
i
said
i
am
only
the
guest
friends
but
i
know
you
want
to
show
me
your
river
at
its
best
so
do
you
think
we
had
better
be
moving
presently
as
it
is
certainly
going
to
be
a
hot
day
chapter
xxiv
up
the
thames
the
second
day
they
were
not
slow
to
take
my
hint
and
indeed
as
to
the
mere
time
of
day
it
was
best
for
us
to
be
off
as
it
was
past
seven
and
the
day
promised
to
be
very
hot
so
we
got
up
and
went
down
to
our
boat
ellen
thoughtful
and
abstracted
the
old
man
very
kind
and
courteous
as
if
to
make
up
for
his
crabbedness
of
opinion
clara
was
cheerful
and
natural
but
a
little
subdued
i
thought
and
she
at
least
was
not
sorry
to
be
gone
and
often
looked
shyly
and
timidly
at
ellen
and
her
strange
wild
beauty
so
we
got
into
the
boat
dick
saying
as
he
took
his
place
well
it
a
fine
day
and
the
old
man
answering
what
you
like
that
do
you
once
more
and
presently
dick
was
sending
the
bows
swiftly
through
the
slow
stream
i
turned
round
as
we
got
into
and
waving
my
hand
to
our
hosts
saw
ellen
leaning
on
the
old
man
shoulder
and
caressing
his
healthy
cheek
and
quite
a
keen
pang
smote
me
as
i
thought
how
i
should
never
see
the
beautiful
girl
again
presently
i
insisted
on
taking
the
sculls
and
i
rowed
a
good
deal
that
day
which
no
doubt
accounts
for
the
fact
that
we
got
very
late
to
the
place
which
dick
had
aimed
at
clara
was
particularly
affectionate
to
dick
as
i
noticed
from
the
rowing
thwart
but
as
for
him
he
was
as
frankly
kind
and
merry
as
ever
and
i
was
glad
to
see
it
as
a
man
of
his
temperament
could
not
have
taken
her
caresses
cheerfully
and
without
embarrassment
if
he
had
been
at
all
entangled
by
the
fairy
of
our
last
night
abode
i
need
say
little
about
the
lovely
reaches
of
the
river
here
i
duly
noted
that
absence
of
cockney
villas
which
the
old
man
had
lamented
and
i
saw
with
pleasure
that
my
old
enemies
the
gothic
bridges
had
been
replaced
by
handsome
oak
and
stone
ones
also
the
banks
of
the
forest
that
we
passed
through
had
lost
their
courtly
trimness
and
were
as
wild
and
beautiful
as
need
he
though
the
trees
were
clearly
well
seen
to
i
thought
it
best
in
order
to
get
the
most
direct
information
to
play
the
innocent
about
eton
and
windsor
but
dick
volunteered
his
knowledge
to
me
as
we
lay
in
datchet
lock
about
the
first
quoth
he
up
yonder
are
some
beautiful
old
buildings
which
were
built
for
a
great
college
or
by
one
of
the
mediaeval
kings
edward
the
sixth
i
think
i
smiled
to
myself
at
his
rather
natural
blunder
he
meant
poor
people
sons
to
be
taught
there
what
knowledge
was
going
in
his
days
but
it
was
a
matter
of
course
that
in
the
times
of
which
you
seem
to
know
so
much
they
spoilt
whatever
good
there
was
in
the
intentions
my
old
kinsman
says
that
they
treated
them
in
a
very
simple
way
and
instead
of
teaching
poor
men
sons
to
know
something
they
taught
rich
men
sons
to
know
nothing
it
seems
from
what
he
says
that
it
was
a
place
for
the
if
you
know
what
that
word
means
i
have
been
told
its
meaning
to
get
rid
of
the
company
of
their
male
children
for
a
great
part
of
the
year
i
daresay
old
hammond
would
give
you
plenty
of
information
in
detail
about
it
what
is
it
used
for
now
said
i
well
said
he
the
buildings
were
a
good
deal
spoilt
by
the
last
few
generations
of
aristocrats
who
seem
to
have
had
a
great
hatred
against
beautiful
old
buildings
and
indeed
all
records
of
past
history
but
it
is
still
a
delightful
place
of
course
we
can
not
use
it
quite
as
the
founder
intended
since
our
ideas
about
teaching
young
people
are
so
changed
from
the
ideas
of
his
time
so
it
is
used
now
as
a
dwelling
for
people
engaged
in
learning
and
folk
from
round
about
come
and
get
taught
things
that
they
want
to
learn
and
there
is
a
great
library
there
of
the
best
books
so
that
i
do
think
that
the
old
dead
king
would
be
much
hurt
if
he
were
to
come
to
life
and
see
what
we
are
doing
there
well
said
clara
laughing
i
think
he
would
miss
the
boys
not
always
my
dear
said
dick
for
there
are
often
plenty
of
boys
there
who
come
to
get
taught
and
also
said
he
smiling
to
learn
boating
and
swimming
i
wish
we
could
stop
there
but
perhaps
we
had
better
do
that
coming
down
the
water
the
opened
as
he
spoke
and
out
we
went
and
on
and
as
for
windsor
he
said
nothing
till
i
lay
on
my
oars
for
i
was
sculling
then
in
clewer
reach
and
looking
up
said
what
is
all
that
building
up
there
said
he
there
i
thought
i
would
wait
till
you
asked
yourself
that
is
windsor
castle
that
also
i
thought
i
would
keep
for
you
till
we
come
down
the
water
it
looks
fine
from
here
does
it
but
a
great
deal
of
it
has
been
built
or
skinned
in
the
time
of
the
degradation
and
we
would
pull
the
buildings
down
since
they
were
there
just
as
with
the
buildings
of
the
you
know
of
course
that
it
was
the
palace
of
our
old
mediaeval
kings
and
was
used
later
on
for
the
same
purpose
by
the
parliamentary
commercial
as
my
old
kinsman
calls
them
yes
said
i
i
know
all
that
what
is
it
used
for
now
a
great
many
people
live
there
said
he
as
with
all
drawbacks
it
is
a
pleasant
place
there
is
also
a
store
of
antiquities
of
various
kinds
that
have
seemed
worth
keeping
a
museum
it
would
have
been
called
in
the
times
you
understand
so
well
i
drew
my
sculls
through
the
water
at
that
last
word
and
pulled
as
if
i
were
fleeing
from
those
times
which
i
understood
so
well
and
we
were
soon
going
up
the
once
sorely
reaches
of
the
river
about
maidenhead
which
now
looked
as
pleasant
and
enjoyable
as
the
reaches
the
morning
was
now
getting
on
the
morning
of
a
jewel
of
a
summer
day
one
of
those
days
which
if
they
were
commoner
in
these
islands
would
make
our
climate
the
best
of
all
climates
without
dispute
a
light
wind
blew
from
the
west
the
little
clouds
that
had
arisen
at
about
our
breakfast
time
had
seemed
to
get
higher
and
higher
in
the
heavens
and
in
spite
of
the
burning
sun
we
no
more
longed
for
rain
than
we
feared
it
burning
as
the
sun
was
there
was
a
fresh
feeling
in
the
air
that
almost
set
us
for
the
rest
of
the
hot
afternoon
and
the
stretch
of
blossoming
wheat
seen
from
the
shadow
of
the
boughs
no
one
unburdened
with
very
heavy
anxieties
could
have
felt
otherwise
than
happy
that
morning
and
it
must
be
said
that
whatever
anxieties
might
lie
beneath
the
surface
of
things
we
did
seem
to
come
across
any
of
them
we
passed
by
several
fields
where
haymaking
was
going
on
but
dick
and
especially
clara
were
so
jealous
of
our
festival
that
they
would
not
allow
me
to
have
much
to
say
to
them
i
could
only
notice
that
the
people
in
the
fields
looked
strong
and
handsome
both
men
and
women
and
that
so
far
from
there
being
any
appearance
of
sordidness
about
their
attire
they
seemed
to
be
dressed
specially
for
the
occasion
lightly
of
course
but
gaily
and
with
plenty
of
adornment
both
on
this
day
as
well
as
yesterday
we
had
as
you
may
think
met
and
passed
and
been
passed
by
many
craft
of
one
kind
and
another
the
most
part
of
these
were
being
rowed
like
ourselves
or
were
sailing
in
the
sort
of
way
that
sailing
is
managed
on
the
upper
reaches
of
the
river
but
every
now
and
then
we
came
on
barges
laden
with
hay
or
other
country
produce
or
carrying
bricks
lime
timber
and
the
like
and
these
were
going
on
their
way
without
any
means
of
propulsion
visible
to
me
just
a
man
at
the
tiller
with
often
a
friend
or
two
laughing
and
talking
with
him
dick
seeing
on
one
occasion
this
day
that
i
was
looking
rather
hard
on
one
of
these
said
that
is
one
of
our
it
is
quite
as
easy
to
work
vehicles
by
force
by
water
as
by
land
i
understood
pretty
well
that
these
force
vehicles
had
taken
the
place
of
our
old
carrying
but
i
took
good
care
not
to
ask
any
questions
about
them
as
i
knew
well
enough
both
that
i
should
never
be
able
to
understand
how
they
were
worked
and
that
in
attempting
to
do
so
i
should
betray
myself
or
get
into
some
complication
impossible
to
explain
so
i
merely
said
yes
of
course
i
understand
we
went
ashore
at
bisham
where
the
remains
of
the
old
abbey
and
the
elizabethan
house
that
had
been
added
to
them
yet
remained
none
the
worse
for
many
years
of
careful
and
appreciative
habitation
the
folk
of
the
place
however
were
mostly
in
the
fields
that
day
both
men
and
women
so
we
met
only
two
old
men
there
and
a
younger
one
who
had
stayed
at
home
to
get
on
with
some
literary
work
which
i
imagine
we
considerably
interrupted
yet
i
also
think
that
the
man
who
received
us
was
not
very
sorry
for
the
interruption
anyhow
he
kept
on
pressing
us
to
stay
over
and
over
again
till
at
last
we
did
not
get
away
till
the
cool
of
the
evening
however
that
mattered
little
to
us
the
nights
were
light
for
the
moon
was
shining
in
her
third
quarter
and
it
was
all
one
to
dick
whether
he
sculled
or
sat
quiet
in
the
boat
so
we
went
away
a
great
pace
the
evening
sun
shone
bright
on
the
remains
of
the
old
buildings
at
medmenham
close
beside
which
arose
an
irregular
pile
of
building
which
dick
told
us
was
a
very
pleasant
house
and
there
were
plenty
of
houses
visible
on
the
wide
meadows
opposite
under
the
hill
for
as
it
seems
that
the
beauty
of
hurley
had
compelled
people
to
build
and
live
there
a
good
deal
the
sun
very
low
down
showed
us
henley
little
altered
in
outward
aspect
from
what
i
remembered
it
actual
daylight
failed
us
as
we
passed
through
the
lovely
reaches
of
wargrave
and
shiplake
but
the
moon
rose
behind
us
presently
i
should
like
to
have
seen
with
my
eyes
what
success
the
new
order
of
things
had
had
in
getting
rid
of
the
sprawling
mess
with
which
commercialism
had
littered
the
banks
of
the
wide
stream
about
reading
and
caversham
certainly
everything
smelt
too
deliciously
in
the
early
night
for
there
to
be
any
of
the
old
careless
sordidness
of
manufacture
and
in
answer
to
my
question
as
to
what
sort
of
a
place
reading
was
dick
answered
o
a
nice
town
enough
in
its
way
mostly
rebuilt
within
the
last
hundred
years
and
there
are
a
good
many
houses
as
you
can
see
by
the
lights
just
down
under
the
hills
yonder
in
fact
it
is
one
of
the
most
populous
places
on
the
thames
round
about
here
keep
up
your
spirits
guest
we
are
close
to
our
journey
end
for
the
night
i
ought
to
ask
your
pardon
for
not
stopping
at
one
of
the
houses
here
or
higher
up
but
a
friend
who
is
living
in
a
very
pleasant
house
in
the
meads
particularly
wanted
me
and
clara
to
come
and
see
him
on
our
way
up
the
thames
and
i
thought
you
would
mind
this
bit
of
night
travelling
he
need
not
have
adjured
me
to
keep
up
my
spirits
which
were
as
high
as
possible
though
the
strangeness
and
excitement
of
the
happy
and
quiet
life
which
i
saw
everywhere
around
me
was
it
is
true
a
little
wearing
off
yet
a
deep
content
as
different
as
possible
from
languid
acquiescence
was
taking
its
place
and
i
was
as
it
were
really
born
we
landed
presently
just
where
i
remembered
the
river
making
an
elbow
to
the
north
towards
the
ancient
house
of
the
blunts
with
the
wide
meadows
spreading
on
the
side
and
on
the
left
the
long
line
of
beautiful
old
trees
overhanging
the
water
as
we
got
out
of
the
boat
i
said
to
dick
is
it
the
old
house
we
are
going
to
no
he
said
though
that
is
standing
still
in
green
old
age
and
is
well
inhabited
i
see
by
the
way
that
you
know
your
thames
well
but
my
friend
walter
allen
who
asked
me
to
stop
here
lives
in
a
house
not
very
big
which
has
been
built
here
lately
because
these
meadows
are
so
much
liked
especially
in
summer
that
there
was
getting
to
be
rather
too
much
of
tenting
on
the
open
field
so
the
parishes
here
about
who
rather
objected
to
that
built
three
houses
between
this
and
caversham
and
quite
a
large
one
at
basildon
a
little
higher
up
look
yonder
are
the
lights
of
walter
allen
house
so
we
walked
over
the
grass
of
the
meadows
under
a
flood
of
moonlight
and
soon
came
to
the
house
which
was
low
and
built
round
a
quadrangle
big
enough
to
get
plenty
of
sunshine
in
it
walter
allen
dick
friend
was
leaning
against
the
jamb
of
the
doorway
waiting
for
us
and
took
us
into
the
hall
without
overplus
of
words
there
were
not
many
people
in
it
as
some
of
the
dwellers
there
were
away
at
the
haymaking
in
the
neighbourhood
and
some
as
walter
told
us
were
wandering
about
the
meadow
enjoying
the
beautiful
moonlit
night
dick
friend
looked
to
be
a
man
of
about
forty
tall
very
and
thoughtful
but
rather
to
my
surprise
there
was
a
shade
of
melancholy
on
his
face
and
he
seemed
a
little
abstracted
and
inattentive
to
our
chat
in
spite
of
obvious
efforts
to
listen
dick
looked
on
him
from
time
to
time
and
seemed
troubled
and
at
last
he
said
i
say
old
fellow
if
there
is
anything
the
matter
which
we
know
of
when
you
wrote
to
me
do
you
think
you
had
better
tell
us
about
it
at
once
or
else
we
shall
think
we
have
come
here
at
an
unlucky
time
and
are
not
quite
wanted
walter
turned
red
and
seemed
to
have
some
difficulty
in
restraining
his
tears
but
said
at
last
of
course
everybody
here
is
very
glad
to
see
you
dick
and
your
friends
but
it
is
true
that
we
are
not
at
our
best
in
spite
of
the
fine
weather
and
the
glorious
we
have
had
a
death
here
said
dick
well
you
should
get
over
that
neighbour
such
things
must
be
yes
walter
said
but
this
was
a
death
by
violence
and
it
seems
likely
to
lead
to
at
least
one
more
and
somehow
it
makes
us
feel
rather
shy
of
one
another
and
to
say
the
truth
that
is
one
reason
why
there
are
so
few
of
us
present
tell
us
the
story
walter
said
dick
perhaps
telling
it
will
help
you
to
shake
off
your
sadness
said
walter
well
i
will
and
i
will
make
it
short
enough
though
i
daresay
it
might
be
spun
out
into
a
long
one
as
used
to
be
done
with
such
subjects
in
the
old
novels
there
is
a
very
charming
girl
here
whom
we
all
like
and
whom
some
of
us
do
more
than
like
and
she
very
naturally
liked
one
of
us
better
than
anybody
else
and
another
of
us
i
wo
name
him
got
fairly
bitten
with
and
used
to
go
about
making
himself
as
unpleasant
as
he
could
not
of
malice
prepense
of
course
so
that
the
girl
who
liked
him
well
enough
at
first
though
she
did
love
him
began
fairly
to
dislike
him
of
course
those
of
us
who
knew
him
best
myself
amongst
others
advised
him
to
go
away
as
he
was
making
matters
worse
and
worse
for
himself
every
day
well
he
take
our
advice
that
also
i
suppose
was
a
matter
of
course
so
we
had
to
tell
him
that
he
go
or
the
inevitable
sending
to
coventry
would
follow
for
his
individual
trouble
had
so
overmastered
him
that
we
felt
that
must
go
if
he
did
not
he
took
that
better
than
we
expected
when
something
or
other
an
interview
with
the
girl
i
think
and
some
hot
words
with
the
successful
lover
following
close
upon
it
threw
him
quite
off
his
balance
and
he
got
hold
of
an
axe
and
fell
upon
his
rival
when
there
was
no
one
by
and
in
the
struggle
that
followed
the
man
attacked
hit
him
an
unlucky
blow
and
killed
him
and
now
the
slayer
in
his
turn
is
so
upset
that
he
is
like
to
kill
himself
and
if
he
does
the
girl
will
do
as
much
i
fear
and
all
this
we
could
no
more
help
than
the
earthquake
of
the
year
before
last
it
is
very
unhappy
said
dick
but
since
the
man
is
dead
and
can
not
be
brought
to
life
again
and
since
the
slayer
had
no
malice
in
him
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
see
why
he
should
get
over
it
before
long
besides
it
was
the
right
man
that
was
killed
and
not
the
wrong
why
should
a
man
brood
over
a
mere
accident
for
ever
and
the
girl
as
to
her
said
walter
the
whole
thing
seems
to
have
inspired
her
with
terror
rather
than
grief
what
you
say
about
the
man
is
true
or
it
should
be
but
then
you
see
the
excitement
and
jealousy
that
was
the
prelude
to
this
tragedy
had
made
an
evil
and
feverish
element
round
about
him
from
which
he
does
not
seem
to
be
able
to
escape
however
we
have
advised
him
to
go
away
in
fact
to
cross
the
seas
but
he
is
in
such
a
state
that
i
do
not
think
he
go
unless
someone
him
and
i
think
it
will
fall
to
my
lot
to
do
so
which
is
scarcely
a
cheerful
outlook
for
me
o
you
will
find
a
certain
kind
of
interest
in
it
said
dick
and
of
course
he
soon
look
upon
the
affair
from
a
reasonable
point
of
view
sooner
or
later
well
at
any
rate
quoth
walter
now
that
i
have
eased
my
mind
by
making
you
uncomfortable
let
us
have
an
end
of
the
subject
for
the
present
are
you
going
to
take
your
guest
to
oxford
why
of
course
we
must
pass
through
it
said
dick
smiling
as
we
are
going
into
the
upper
waters
but
i
thought
that
we
would
stop
there
or
we
shall
be
belated
as
to
the
haymaking
up
our
way
so
oxford
and
my
learned
lecture
on
it
all
got
at
from
my
old
kinsman
must
wait
till
we
come
down
the
water
a
fortnight
hence
i
listened
to
this
story
with
much
surprise
and
could
not
help
wondering
at
first
that
the
man
who
had
slain
the
other
had
not
been
put
in
custody
till
it
could
be
proved
that
he
killed
his
rival
in
only
however
the
more
i
thought
of
it
the
plainer
it
grew
to
me
that
no
amount
of
examination
of
witnesses
who
had
witnessed
nothing
but
the
blood
between
the
two
rivals
would
have
done
anything
to
clear
up
the
case
i
could
not
help
thinking
also
that
the
remorse
of
this
homicide
gave
point
to
what
old
hammond
had
said
to
me
about
the
way
in
which
this
strange
people
dealt
with
what
i
had
been
used
to
hear
called
crimes
truly
the
remorse
was
exaggerated
but
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
slayer
took
the
whole
consequences
of
the
act
upon
himself
and
did
not
expect
society
to
whitewash
him
by
punishing
him
i
had
no
fear
any
longer
that
the
sacredness
of
human
life
was
likely
to
suffer
amongst
my
friends
from
the
absence
of
gallows
and
prison
chapter
xxv
the
third
day
on
the
thames
as
we
went
down
to
the
boat
next
morning
walter
could
not
quite
keep
off
the
subject
of
last
night
though
he
was
more
hopeful
than
he
had
been
then
and
seemed
to
think
that
if
the
unlucky
homicide
could
not
be
got
to
go
he
might
at
any
rate
go
and
live
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
pretty
much
by
himself
at
any
rate
that
was
what
he
himself
had
proposed
to
dick
and
i
must
say
to
me
also
this
seemed
a
strange
remedy
and
dick
said
as
much
quoth
he
friend
walter
do
set
the
man
brooding
on
the
tragedy
by
letting
him
live
alone
that
will
only
strengthen
his
idea
that
he
has
committed
a
crime
and
you
will
have
him
killing
himself
in
good
earnest
said
clara
i
do
know
if
i
may
say
what
i
think
of
it
it
is
that
he
had
better
have
his
fill
of
gloom
now
and
so
to
say
wake
up
presently
to
see
how
little
need
there
has
been
for
it
and
then
he
will
live
happily
afterwards
as
for
his
killing
himself
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
that
for
from
all
you
tell
me
he
is
really
very
much
in
love
with
the
woman
and
to
speak
plainly
until
his
love
is
satisfied
he
will
not
only
stick
to
life
as
tightly
as
he
can
but
will
also
make
the
most
of
every
event
of
his
life
will
so
to
say
hug
himself
up
in
it
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
real
explanation
of
his
taking
the
whole
matter
with
such
an
excess
of
tragedy
walter
looked
thoughtful
and
said
well
you
may
be
right
and
perhaps
we
should
have
treated
it
all
more
lightly
but
you
see
guest
turning
to
me
such
things
happen
so
seldom
that
when
they
do
happen
we
can
not
help
being
much
taken
up
with
it
for
the
rest
we
are
all
inclined
to
excuse
our
poor
friend
for
making
us
so
unhappy
on
the
ground
that
he
does
it
out
of
an
exaggerated
respect
for
human
life
and
its
happiness
well
i
will
say
no
more
about
it
only
this
will
you
give
me
a
cast
up
stream
as
i
want
to
look
after
a
lonely
habitation
for
the
poor
fellow
since
he
will
have
it
so
and
i
hear
that
there
is
one
which
would
suit
us
very
well
on
the
downs
beyond
streatley
so
if
you
will
put
me
ashore
there
i
will
walk
up
the
hill
and
look
to
it
is
the
house
in
question
empty
said
i
no
said
walter
but
the
man
who
lives
there
will
go
out
of
it
of
course
when
he
hears
that
we
want
it
you
see
we
think
that
the
fresh
air
of
the
downs
and
the
very
emptiness
of
the
landscape
will
do
our
friend
good
yes
said
clara
smiling
and
he
will
not
be
so
far
from
his
beloved
that
they
can
not
easily
meet
if
they
have
a
mind
to
as
they
certainly
will
this
talk
had
brought
us
down
to
the
boat
and
we
were
presently
afloat
on
the
beautiful
broad
stream
dick
driving
the
prow
swiftly
through
the
windless
water
of
the
early
summer
morning
for
it
was
not
yet
six
we
were
at
the
lock
in
a
very
little
time
and
as
we
lay
rising
and
rising
on
the
water
i
could
not
help
wondering
that
my
old
friend
the
and
that
of
the
very
simplest
and
most
rural
kind
should
hold
its
place
there
so
i
said
i
have
been
wondering
as
we
passed
lock
after
lock
that
you
people
so
prosperous
as
you
are
and
especially
since
you
are
so
anxious
for
pleasant
work
to
do
have
not
invented
something
which
would
get
rid
of
this
clumsy
business
of
going
by
means
of
these
rude
contrivances
dick
laughed
my
dear
friend
said
he
as
long
as
water
has
the
clumsy
habit
of
running
down
hill
i
fear
we
must
humour
it
by
going
stairs
when
we
have
our
faces
turned
from
the
sea
and
really
i
see
why
you
should
fall
foul
of
lock
which
i
think
a
very
pretty
place
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
latter
assertion
i
thought
as
i
looked
up
at
the
overhanging
boughs
of
the
great
trees
with
the
sun
coming
glittering
through
the
leaves
and
listened
to
the
song
of
the
summer
blackbirds
as
it
mingled
with
the
sound
of
the
backwater
near
us
so
not
being
able
to
say
why
i
wanted
the
locks
away
which
indeed
i
did
do
at
all
i
held
my
peace
but
walter
said
you
see
guest
this
is
not
an
age
of
inventions
the
last
epoch
did
all
that
for
us
and
we
are
now
content
to
use
such
of
its
inventions
as
we
find
handy
and
leaving
those
alone
which
we
do
want
i
believe
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
some
time
ago
i
ca
give
you
a
date
some
elaborate
machinery
was
used
for
the
locks
though
people
did
not
go
so
far
as
try
to
make
the
water
run
up
hill
however
it
was
troublesome
i
suppose
and
the
simple
hatches
and
the
gates
with
a
big
counterpoising
beam
were
found
to
answer
every
purpose
and
were
easily
mended
when
wanted
with
material
always
to
hand
so
here
they
are
as
you
see
besides
said
dick
this
kind
of
lock
is
pretty
as
you
can
see
and
i
ca
help
thinking
that
your
winding
up
like
a
watch
would
have
been
ugly
and
would
have
spoiled
the
look
of
the
river
and
that
is
surely
reason
enough
for
keeping
such
locks
as
these
old
fellow
said
he
to
the
lock
as
he
pushed
us
out
through
the
now
open
gates
by
a
vigorous
stroke
of
the
may
you
live
long
and
have
your
green
old
age
renewed
for
ever
on
we
went
and
the
water
had
the
familiar
aspect
to
me
of
the
days
before
pangbourne
had
been
thoroughly
cocknified
as
i
have
seen
it
it
pangbourne
was
distinctly
a
village
still
a
definite
group
of
houses
and
as
pretty
as
might
be
the
still
covered
the
hill
that
rose
above
basildon
but
the
flat
fields
beneath
them
were
much
more
populous
than
i
remembered
them
as
there
were
five
large
houses
in
sight
very
carefully
designed
so
as
not
to
hurt
the
character
of
the
country
down
on
the
green
lip
of
the
river
just
where
the
water
turns
toward
the
goring
and
streatley
reaches
were
half
a
dozen
girls
playing
about
on
the
grass
they
hailed
us
as
we
were
about
passing
them
as
they
noted
that
we
were
travellers
and
we
stopped
a
minute
to
talk
with
them
they
had
been
bathing
and
were
light
clad
and
and
were
bound
for
the
meadows
on
the
berkshire
side
where
the
haymaking
had
begun
and
were
passing
the
time
merrily
enough
till
the
berkshire
folk
came
in
their
punt
to
fetch
them
at
first
nothing
would
content
them
but
we
must
go
with
them
into
the
and
breakfast
with
them
but
dick
put
forward
his
theory
of
beginning
the
higher
up
the
water
and
not
spoiling
my
pleasure
therein
by
giving
me
a
taste
of
it
elsewhere
and
they
gave
way
though
unwillingly
in
revenge
they
asked
me
a
great
many
questions
about
the
country
i
came
from
and
the
manners
of
life
there
which
i
found
rather
puzzling
to
answer
and
doubtless
what
answers
i
did
give
were
puzzling
enough
to
them
i
noticed
both
with
these
pretty
girls
and
with
everybody
else
we
met
that
in
default
of
serious
news
such
as
we
had
heard
at
they
were
eager
to
discuss
all
the
little
details
of
life
the
weather
the
the
last
new
house
the
plenty
or
lack
of
such
and
such
birds
and
so
on
and
they
talked
of
these
things
not
in
a
fatuous
and
conventional
way
but
as
taking
i
say
real
interest
in
them
moreover
i
found
that
the
women
knew
as
much
about
all
these
things
as
the
men
could
name
a
flower
and
knew
its
qualities
could
tell
you
the
habitat
of
such
and
such
birds
and
fish
and
the
like
it
is
almost
strange
what
a
difference
this
intelligence
made
in
my
estimate
of
the
country
life
of
that
day
for
it
used
to
be
said
in
past
times
and
on
the
whole
truly
that
outside
their
daily
work
country
people
knew
little
of
the
country
and
at
least
could
tell
you
nothing
about
it
while
here
were
these
people
as
eager
about
all
the
goings
on
in
the
fields
and
woods
and
downs
as
if
they
had
been
cockneys
newly
escaped
from
the
tyranny
of
bricks
and
mortar
i
may
mention
as
a
detail
worth
noticing
that
not
only
did
there
seem
to
be
a
great
many
more
birds
about
of
the
kinds
but
their
enemies
the
birds
of
prey
were
also
commoner
a
kite
hung
over
our
heads
as
we
passed
medmenham
yesterday
magpies
were
quite
common
in
the
hedgerows
i
saw
several
and
i
think
a
merlin
and
now
just
as
we
were
passing
the
pretty
bridge
which
had
taken
the
place
of
basildon
a
couple
of
ravens
croaked
above
our
boat
as
they
sailed
off
to
the
higher
ground
of
the
downs
i
concluded
from
all
this
that
the
days
of
the
gamekeeper
were
over
and
did
not
even
need
to
ask
dick
a
question
about
it
chapter
xxvi
the
obstinate
refusers
before
we
parted
from
these
girls
we
saw
two
sturdy
young
men
and
a
woman
putting
off
from
the
berkshire
shore
and
then
dick
bethought
him
of
a
little
banter
of
the
girls
and
asked
them
how
it
was
that
there
was
nobody
of
the
male
kind
to
go
with
them
across
the
water
and
where
their
boats
were
gone
to
said
one
the
youngest
of
the
party
o
they
have
got
the
big
punt
to
lead
stone
from
up
the
water
who
do
you
mean
by
dear
child
said
dick
said
an
older
girl
laughing
you
had
better
go
and
see
them
look
there
and
she
pointed
northwest
do
you
see
building
going
on
there
yes
said
dick
and
i
am
rather
surprised
at
this
time
of
the
year
why
are
they
not
haymaking
with
you
the
girls
all
laughed
at
this
and
before
their
laugh
was
over
the
berkshire
boat
had
run
on
to
the
grass
and
the
girls
stepped
in
lightly
still
sniggering
while
the
new
comers
gave
us
the
sele
of
the
day
but
before
they
were
under
way
again
the
tall
girl
said
excuse
us
for
laughing
dear
neighbours
but
we
have
had
some
friendly
bickering
with
the
builders
up
yonder
and
as
we
have
no
time
to
tell
you
the
story
you
had
better
go
and
ask
them
they
will
be
glad
to
see
you
if
you
do
hinder
their
work
they
all
laughed
again
at
that
and
waved
us
a
pretty
farewell
as
the
punters
set
them
over
toward
the
other
shore
and
left
us
standing
on
the
bank
beside
our
boat
let
us
go
and
see
them
said
clara
that
is
if
you
are
not
in
a
hurry
to
get
to
streatley
walter
o
no
said
walter
i
shall
be
glad
of
the
excuse
to
have
a
little
more
of
your
company
so
we
left
the
boat
moored
there
and
went
on
up
the
slow
slope
of
the
hill
but
i
said
to
dick
on
the
way
being
somewhat
mystified
what
was
all
that
laughing
about
what
was
the
joke
i
can
guess
pretty
well
said
dick
some
of
them
up
there
have
got
a
piece
of
work
which
interests
them
and
they
wo
go
to
the
haymaking
which
does
matter
at
all
because
there
are
plenty
of
people
to
do
such
work
as
that
only
since
haymaking
is
a
regular
festival
the
neighbours
find
it
amusing
to
jeer
at
them
i
see
said
i
much
as
if
in
dickens
time
some
young
people
were
so
wrapped
up
in
their
work
that
they
would
keep
christmas
just
so
said
dick
only
these
people
need
not
be
young
either
but
what
did
you
mean
by
work
said
quoth
dick
did
i
say
that
i
mean
work
that
tries
the
muscles
and
hardens
them
and
sends
you
pleasantly
weary
to
bed
but
which
trying
in
other
ways
does
harass
you
in
short
such
work
is
always
pleasant
if
you
do
overdo
it
only
mind
you
good
mowing
requires
some
little
skill
i
a
pretty
good
mower
this
talk
brought
us
up
to
the
house
that
was
not
a
large
one
which
stood
at
the
end
of
a
beautiful
orchard
surrounded
by
an
old
stone
wall
o
yes
i
see
said
dick
i
remember
a
beautiful
place
for
a
house
but
a
starveling
of
a
nineteenth
century
house
stood
there
i
am
glad
they
are
rebuilding
it
all
stone
too
though
it
need
not
have
been
in
this
part
of
the
country
my
word
though
they
are
making
a
neat
job
of
it
but
i
would
have
made
it
all
ashlar
walter
and
clara
were
already
talking
to
a
tall
man
clad
in
his
blouse
who
looked
about
forty
but
was
i
daresay
older
who
had
his
mallet
and
chisel
in
hand
there
were
at
work
in
the
shed
and
on
the
scaffold
about
half
a
dozen
men
and
two
women
like
the
carles
while
a
very
pretty
woman
who
was
not
in
the
work
but
was
dressed
in
an
elegant
suit
of
blue
linen
came
sauntering
up
to
us
with
her
knitting
in
her
hand
she
welcomed
us
and
said
smiling
so
you
are
come
up
from
the
water
to
see
the
obstinate
refusers
where
are
you
going
haymaking
neighbours
o
right
up
above
oxford
said
dick
it
is
rather
a
late
country
but
what
share
have
you
got
with
the
refusers
pretty
neighbour
said
she
with
a
laugh
o
i
am
the
lucky
one
who
does
want
to
work
though
sometimes
i
get
it
for
i
serve
as
model
to
mistress
philippa
there
when
she
wants
one
she
is
our
head
carver
come
and
see
her
she
led
us
up
to
the
door
of
the
unfinished
house
where
a
rather
little
woman
was
working
with
mallet
and
chisel
on
the
wall
near
by
she
seemed
very
intent
on
what
she
was
doing
and
did
not
turn
round
when
we
came
up
but
a
taller
woman
quite
a
girl
she
seemed
who
was
at
work
near
by
had
already
knocked
off
and
was
standing
looking
from
clara
to
dick
with
delighted
eyes
none
of
the
others
paid
much
heed
to
us
the
girl
laid
her
hand
on
the
carver
shoulder
and
said
now
philippa
if
you
gobble
up
your
work
like
that
you
will
soon
have
none
to
do
and
what
will
become
of
you
then
the
carver
turned
round
hurriedly
and
showed
us
the
face
of
a
woman
of
forty
or
so
she
seemed
and
said
rather
pettishly
but
in
a
sweet
voice
do
talk
nonsense
kate
and
do
interrupt
me
if
you
can
help
it
she
stopped
short
when
she
saw
us
then
went
on
with
the
kind
smile
of
welcome
which
never
failed
us
thank
you
for
coming
to
see
us
neighbours
but
i
am
sure
that
you
wo
think
me
unkind
if
i
go
on
with
my
work
especially
when
i
tell
you
that
i
was
ill
and
unable
to
do
anything
all
through
april
and
may
and
this
and
the
sun
and
the
work
together
and
my
feeling
well
again
too
make
a
mere
delight
of
every
hour
to
me
and
excuse
me
i
must
go
on
she
fell
to
work
accordingly
on
a
carving
in
low
relief
of
flowers
and
figures
but
talked
on
amidst
her
mallet
strokes
you
see
we
all
think
this
the
prettiest
place
for
a
house
up
and
down
these
reaches
and
the
site
has
been
so
long
encumbered
with
an
unworthy
one
that
we
masons
were
determined
to
pay
off
fate
and
destiny
for
once
and
build
the
prettiest
house
we
could
compass
here
and
so
and
so
here
she
lapsed
into
mere
carving
but
the
tall
foreman
came
up
and
said
yes
neighbours
that
is
it
so
it
is
going
to
be
all
ashlar
because
we
want
to
carve
a
kind
of
a
wreath
of
flowers
and
figures
all
round
it
and
we
have
been
much
hindered
by
one
thing
or
other
philippa
illness
amongst
others
and
though
we
could
have
managed
our
wreath
without
her
could
you
though
grumbled
the
from
the
face
of
the
wall
well
at
any
rate
she
is
our
best
carver
and
it
would
not
have
been
kind
to
begin
the
carving
without
her
so
you
see
said
he
looking
at
dick
and
me
we
really
could
go
haymaking
could
we
neighbours
but
you
see
we
are
getting
on
so
fast
now
with
this
splendid
weather
that
i
think
we
may
well
spare
a
week
or
ten
days
at
and
wo
we
go
at
that
work
then
come
down
then
to
the
acres
that
lie
north
and
by
west
here
at
our
backs
and
you
shall
see
good
harvesters
neighbours
hurrah
for
a
good
brag
called
a
voice
from
the
scaffold
above
us
our
foreman
thinks
that
an
easier
job
than
putting
one
stone
on
another
there
was
a
general
laugh
at
this
sally
in
which
the
tall
foreman
joined
and
with
that
we
saw
a
lad
bringing
out
a
little
table
into
the
shadow
of
the
which
he
set
down
there
and
then
going
back
came
out
again
with
the
inevitable
big
wickered
flask
and
tall
glasses
whereon
the
foreman
led
us
up
to
due
seats
on
blocks
of
stone
and
said
well
neighbours
drink
to
my
brag
coming
true
or
i
shall
think
you
do
believe
me
up
there
said
he
hailing
the
scaffold
are
you
coming
down
for
a
glass
three
of
the
workmen
came
running
down
the
ladder
as
men
with
good
building
legs
will
do
but
the
others
answer
except
the
joker
if
he
must
so
be
called
who
called
out
without
turning
round
excuse
me
neighbours
for
not
getting
down
i
must
get
on
my
work
is
not
superintending
like
the
gaffer
yonder
but
you
fellows
send
us
up
a
glass
to
drink
the
haymakers
health
of
course
philippa
would
not
turn
away
from
her
beloved
work
but
the
other
woman
carver
came
she
turned
out
to
be
philippa
daughter
but
was
a
tall
strong
girl
and
of
face
and
curiously
solemn
of
manner
the
rest
gathered
round
us
and
clinked
glasses
and
the
men
on
the
scaffold
turned
about
and
drank
to
our
healths
but
the
busy
little
woman
by
the
door
would
have
none
of
it
all
but
only
shrugged
her
shoulders
when
her
daughter
came
up
to
her
and
touched
her
so
we
shook
hands
and
turned
our
backs
on
the
obstinate
refusers
went
down
the
slope
to
our
boat
and
before
we
had
gone
many
steps
heard
the
full
tune
of
tinkling
trowels
mingle
with
the
humming
of
the
bees
and
the
singing
of
the
larks
above
the
little
plain
of
basildon
chapter
xxvii
the
upper
waters
we
set
walter
ashore
on
the
berkshire
side
amidst
all
the
beauties
of
streatley
and
so
went
our
ways
into
what
once
would
have
been
the
deeper
country
under
the
of
the
white
horse
and
though
the
contrast
between
and
wholly
unsophisticated
country
existed
no
longer
a
feeling
of
exultation
rose
within
me
as
it
used
to
do
at
sight
of
the
familiar
and
still
unchanged
hills
of
the
berkshire
range
we
stopped
at
wallingford
for
our
meal
of
course
all
signs
of
squalor
and
poverty
had
disappeared
from
the
streets
of
the
ancient
town
and
many
ugly
houses
had
been
taken
down
and
many
pretty
new
ones
built
but
i
thought
it
curious
that
the
town
still
looked
like
the
old
place
i
remembered
so
well
for
indeed
it
looked
like
that
ought
to
have
looked
at
dinner
we
fell
in
with
an
old
but
very
bright
and
intelligent
man
who
seemed
in
a
country
way
to
be
another
edition
of
old
hammond
he
had
an
extraordinary
detailed
knowledge
of
the
ancient
history
of
the
side
from
the
time
of
alfred
to
the
days
of
the
parliamentary
wars
many
events
of
which
as
you
may
know
were
enacted
round
about
wallingford
but
what
was
more
interesting
to
us
he
had
detailed
record
of
the
period
of
the
change
to
the
present
state
of
things
and
told
us
a
great
deal
about
it
and
especially
of
that
exodus
of
the
people
from
the
town
to
the
country
and
the
gradual
recovery
by
the
people
on
one
side
and
the
people
on
the
other
of
those
arts
of
life
which
they
had
each
lost
which
loss
as
he
told
us
had
at
one
time
gone
so
far
that
not
only
was
it
impossible
to
find
a
carpenter
or
a
smith
in
a
village
or
small
country
town
but
that
people
in
such
places
had
even
forgotten
how
to
bake
bread
and
that
at
wallingford
for
instance
the
bread
came
down
with
the
newspapers
by
an
early
train
from
london
worked
in
some
way
the
explanation
of
which
i
could
not
understand
he
told
us
also
that
the
townspeople
who
came
into
the
country
used
to
pick
up
the
agricultural
arts
by
carefully
watching
the
way
in
which
the
machines
worked
gathering
an
idea
of
handicraft
from
machinery
because
at
that
time
almost
everything
in
and
about
the
fields
was
done
by
elaborate
machines
used
quite
unintelligently
by
the
labourers
on
the
other
hand
the
old
men
amongst
the
labourers
managed
to
teach
the
younger
ones
gradually
a
little
artizanship
such
as
the
use
of
the
saw
and
the
plane
the
work
of
the
smithy
and
so
forth
for
once
more
by
that
time
it
was
as
much
as
or
rather
more
than
a
man
could
do
to
fix
an
ash
pole
to
a
rake
by
handiwork
so
that
it
would
take
a
machine
worth
a
thousand
pounds
a
group
of
workmen
and
half
a
day
travelling
to
do
five
shillings
worth
of
work
he
showed
us
among
other
things
an
account
of
a
certain
village
council
who
were
working
hard
at
all
this
business
and
the
record
of
their
intense
earnestness
in
getting
to
the
bottom
of
some
matter
which
in
time
past
would
have
been
thought
quite
trivial
as
for
example
the
due
proportions
of
alkali
and
oil
for
for
the
village
wash
or
the
exact
heat
of
the
water
into
which
a
leg
of
mutton
should
be
plunged
for
boiling
all
this
joined
to
the
utter
absence
of
anything
like
party
feeling
which
even
in
a
village
assembly
would
certainly
have
made
its
appearance
in
an
earlier
epoch
was
very
amusing
and
at
the
same
time
instructive
this
old
man
whose
name
was
henry
morsom
took
us
after
our
meal
and
a
rest
into
a
biggish
hall
which
contained
a
large
collection
of
articles
of
manufacture
and
art
from
the
last
days
of
the
machine
period
to
that
day
and
he
went
over
them
with
us
and
explained
them
with
great
care
they
also
were
very
interesting
showing
the
transition
from
the
makeshift
work
of
the
machines
which
was
at
about
its
worst
a
little
after
the
civil
war
before
told
of
into
the
first
years
of
the
new
handicraft
period
of
course
there
was
much
overlapping
of
the
periods
and
at
first
the
new
handwork
came
in
very
slowly
you
must
remember
said
the
old
antiquary
that
the
handicraft
was
not
the
result
of
what
used
to
be
called
material
necessity
on
the
contrary
by
that
time
the
machines
had
been
so
much
improved
that
almost
all
necessary
work
might
have
been
done
by
them
and
indeed
many
people
at
that
time
and
before
it
used
to
think
that
machinery
would
entirely
supersede
handicraft
which
certainly
on
the
face
of
it
seemed
more
than
likely
but
there
was
another
opinion
far
less
logical
prevalent
amongst
the
rich
people
before
the
days
of
freedom
which
did
not
die
out
at
once
after
that
epoch
had
begun
this
opinion
which
from
all
i
can
learn
seemed
as
natural
then
as
it
seems
absurd
now
was
that
while
the
ordinary
daily
work
of
the
world
would
be
done
entirely
by
automatic
machinery
the
energies
of
the
more
intelligent
part
of
mankind
would
be
set
free
to
follow
the
higher
forms
of
the
arts
as
well
as
science
and
the
study
of
history
it
was
strange
was
it
not
that
they
should
thus
ignore
that
aspiration
after
complete
equality
which
we
now
recognise
as
the
bond
of
all
happy
human
society
i
did
not
answer
but
thought
the
more
dick
looked
thoughtful
and
said
strange
neighbour
well
i
do
know
i
have
often
heard
my
old
kinsman
say
the
one
aim
of
all
people
before
our
time
was
to
avoid
work
or
at
least
they
thought
it
was
so
of
course
the
work
which
their
daily
life
forced
them
to
do
seemed
more
like
work
than
that
which
they
seemed
to
choose
for
themselves
true
enough
said
morsom
anyhow
they
soon
began
to
find
out
their
mistake
and
that
only
slaves
and
could
live
solely
by
setting
machines
going
clara
broke
in
here
flushing
a
little
as
she
spoke
was
not
their
mistake
once
more
bred
of
the
life
of
slavery
that
they
had
been
living
a
life
which
was
always
looking
upon
everything
except
mankind
animate
and
inanimate
as
people
used
to
call
it
as
one
thing
and
mankind
as
another
it
was
natural
to
people
thinking
in
this
way
that
they
should
try
to
make
their
slave
since
they
thought
was
something
outside
them
surely
said
morsom
and
they
were
puzzled
as
to
what
to
do
till
they
found
the
feeling
against
a
mechanical
life
which
had
begun
before
the
great
change
amongst
people
who
had
leisure
to
think
of
such
things
was
spreading
insensibly
till
at
last
under
the
guise
of
pleasure
that
was
not
supposed
to
be
work
work
that
was
pleasure
began
to
push
out
the
mechanical
toil
which
they
had
once
hoped
at
the
best
to
reduce
to
narrow
limits
indeed
but
never
to
get
rid
of
and
which
moreover
they
found
they
could
not
limit
as
they
had
hoped
to
do
when
did
this
new
revolution
gather
head
said
i
in
the
that
followed
the
great
change
said
morsom
it
began
to
be
noteworthy
machine
after
machine
was
quietly
dropped
under
the
excuse
that
the
machines
could
not
produce
works
of
art
and
that
works
of
art
were
more
and
more
called
for
look
here
he
said
here
are
some
of
the
works
of
that
time
rough
and
unskilful
in
handiwork
but
solid
and
showing
some
sense
of
pleasure
in
the
making
they
are
very
curious
said
i
taking
up
a
piece
of
pottery
from
amongst
the
specimens
which
the
antiquary
was
showing
us
not
a
bit
like
the
work
of
either
savages
or
barbarians
and
yet
with
what
would
once
have
been
called
a
hatred
of
civilisation
impressed
upon
them
yes
said
morsom
you
must
not
look
for
delicacy
there
in
that
period
you
could
only
have
got
that
from
a
man
who
was
practically
a
slave
but
now
you
see
said
he
leading
me
on
a
little
we
have
learned
the
trick
of
handicraft
and
have
added
the
utmost
refinement
of
workmanship
to
the
freedom
of
fancy
and
imagination
i
looked
and
wondered
indeed
at
the
deftness
and
abundance
of
beauty
of
the
work
of
men
who
had
at
last
learned
to
accept
life
itself
as
a
pleasure
and
the
satisfaction
of
the
common
needs
of
mankind
and
the
preparation
for
them
as
work
fit
for
the
best
of
the
race
i
mused
silently
but
at
last
i
said
what
is
to
come
after
this
the
old
man
laughed
i
do
know
said
he
we
will
meet
it
when
it
comes
meanwhile
quoth
dick
we
have
got
to
meet
the
rest
of
our
journey
so
out
into
the
street
and
down
to
the
strand
will
you
come
a
turn
with
us
neighbour
our
friend
is
greedy
of
your
stories
i
will
go
as
far
as
oxford
with
you
said
he
i
want
a
book
or
two
out
of
the
bodleian
library
i
suppose
you
will
sleep
in
the
old
city
no
said
dick
we
are
going
higher
up
the
hay
is
waiting
us
there
you
know
morsom
nodded
and
we
all
went
into
the
street
together
and
got
into
the
boat
a
little
above
the
town
bridge
but
just
as
dick
was
getting
the
sculls
into
the
rowlocks
the
bows
of
another
boat
came
thrusting
through
the
low
arch
even
at
first
sight
it
was
a
gay
little
craft
indeed
bright
green
and
painted
over
with
elegantly
drawn
flowers
as
it
cleared
the
arch
a
figure
as
bright
and
as
the
boat
rose
up
in
it
a
slim
girl
dressed
in
light
blue
silk
that
fluttered
in
the
draughty
wind
of
the
bridge
i
thought
i
knew
the
figure
and
sure
enough
as
she
turned
her
head
to
us
and
showed
her
beautiful
face
i
saw
with
joy
that
it
was
none
other
than
the
fairy
godmother
from
the
abundant
garden
on
runnymede
ellen
to
wit
we
all
stopped
to
receive
her
dick
rose
in
the
boat
and
cried
out
a
genial
good
morrow
i
tried
to
be
as
genial
as
dick
but
failed
clara
waved
a
delicate
hand
to
her
and
morsom
nodded
and
looked
on
with
interest
as
to
ellen
the
beautiful
brown
of
her
face
was
deepened
by
a
flush
as
she
brought
the
gunwale
of
her
boat
alongside
ours
and
said
you
see
neighbours
i
had
some
doubt
if
you
would
all
three
come
back
past
runnymede
or
if
you
did
whether
you
would
stop
there
and
besides
i
am
not
sure
whether
we
my
father
and
i
shall
not
be
away
in
a
week
or
two
for
he
wants
to
see
a
brother
of
his
in
the
north
country
and
i
should
not
like
him
to
go
without
me
so
i
thought
i
might
never
see
you
again
and
that
seemed
uncomfortable
to
me
and
and
so
i
came
after
you
well
said
dick
i
am
sure
we
are
all
very
glad
of
that
although
you
may
be
sure
that
as
for
clara
and
me
we
should
have
made
a
point
of
coming
to
see
you
and
of
coming
the
second
time
if
we
had
found
you
away
the
first
but
dear
neighbour
there
you
are
alone
in
the
boat
and
you
have
been
sculling
pretty
hard
i
should
think
and
might
find
a
little
quiet
sitting
pleasant
so
we
had
better
part
our
company
into
two
yes
said
ellen
i
thought
you
would
do
that
so
i
have
brought
a
rudder
for
my
boat
will
you
help
me
to
ship
it
please
and
she
went
aft
in
her
boat
and
pushed
along
our
side
till
she
had
brought
the
stern
close
to
dick
hand
he
knelt
down
in
our
boat
and
she
in
hers
and
the
usual
fumbling
took
place
over
hanging
the
rudder
on
its
hooks
for
as
you
may
imagine
no
change
had
taken
place
in
the
arrangement
of
such
an
unimportant
matter
as
the
rudder
of
a
boat
as
the
two
beautiful
young
faces
bent
over
the
rudder
they
seemed
to
me
to
be
very
close
together
and
though
it
only
lasted
a
moment
a
sort
of
pang
shot
through
me
as
i
looked
on
clara
sat
in
her
place
and
did
not
look
round
but
presently
she
said
with
just
the
least
stiffness
in
her
tone
how
shall
we
divide
wo
you
go
into
ellen
boat
dick
since
without
offence
to
our
guest
you
are
the
better
sculler
dick
stood
up
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
said
no
no
let
guest
try
what
he
can
do
he
ought
to
be
getting
into
training
now
besides
we
are
in
no
hurry
we
are
not
going
far
above
oxford
and
even
if
we
are
benighted
we
shall
have
the
moon
which
will
give
us
nothing
worse
of
a
night
than
a
greyer
day
besides
said
i
i
may
manage
to
do
a
little
more
with
my
sculling
than
merely
keeping
the
boat
from
drifting
down
stream
they
all
laughed
at
this
as
if
it
had
a
been
very
good
joke
and
i
thought
that
ellen
laugh
even
amongst
the
others
was
one
of
the
pleasantest
sounds
i
had
ever
heard
to
be
short
i
got
into
the
boat
not
a
little
elated
and
taking
the
sculls
set
to
work
to
show
off
a
little
for
must
i
say
it
i
felt
as
if
even
that
happy
world
were
made
the
happier
for
my
being
so
near
this
strange
girl
although
i
must
say
that
of
all
the
persons
i
had
seen
in
that
world
renewed
she
was
the
most
unfamiliar
to
me
the
most
unlike
what
i
could
have
thought
of
clara
for
instance
beautiful
and
bright
as
she
was
was
not
unlike
a
pleasant
and
unaffected
young
lady
and
the
other
girls
also
seemed
nothing
more
than
specimens
of
very
much
improved
types
which
i
had
known
in
other
times
but
this
girl
was
not
only
beautiful
with
a
beauty
quite
different
from
that
of
a
young
lady
but
was
in
all
ways
so
strangely
interesting
so
that
i
kept
wondering
what
she
would
say
or
do
next
to
surprise
and
please
me
not
indeed
that
there
was
anything
startling
in
what
she
actually
said
or
did
but
it
was
all
done
in
a
new
way
and
always
with
that
indefinable
interest
and
pleasure
of
life
which
i
had
noticed
more
or
less
in
everybody
but
which
in
her
was
more
marked
and
more
charming
than
in
anyone
else
that
i
had
seen
we
were
soon
under
way
and
going
at
a
fair
pace
through
the
beautiful
reaches
of
the
river
between
bensington
and
dorchester
it
was
now
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
warm
rather
than
hot
and
quite
windless
the
clouds
high
up
and
light
pearly
white
and
gleaming
softened
the
sun
burning
but
did
not
hide
the
pale
blue
in
most
places
though
they
seemed
to
give
it
height
and
consistency
the
sky
in
short
looked
really
like
a
vault
as
poets
have
sometimes
called
it
and
not
like
mere
limitless
air
but
a
vault
so
vast
and
full
of
light
that
it
did
not
in
any
way
oppress
the
spirits
it
was
the
sort
of
afternoon
that
tennyson
must
have
been
thinking
about
when
he
said
of
the
eaters
land
that
it
was
a
land
where
it
was
always
afternoon
ellen
leaned
back
in
the
stern
and
seemed
to
enjoy
herself
thoroughly
i
could
see
that
she
was
really
looking
at
things
and
let
nothing
escape
her
and
as
i
watched
her
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
she
had
been
a
little
touched
by
love
of
the
deft
ready
and
handsome
dick
and
that
she
had
been
constrained
to
follow
us
because
of
it
faded
out
of
my
mind
since
if
it
had
been
so
she
surely
could
not
have
been
so
excitedly
pleased
even
with
the
beautiful
scenes
we
were
passing
through
for
some
time
she
did
not
say
much
but
at
last
as
we
had
passed
under
shillingford
bridge
new
built
but
somewhat
on
its
old
lines
she
bade
me
hold
the
boat
while
she
had
a
good
look
at
the
landscape
through
the
graceful
arch
then
she
turned
about
to
me
and
said
i
do
not
know
whether
to
be
sorry
or
glad
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
been
in
these
reaches
it
is
true
that
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
see
all
this
for
the
first
time
but
if
i
had
had
a
year
or
two
of
memory
of
it
how
sweetly
it
would
all
have
mingled
with
my
life
waking
or
dreaming
i
am
so
glad
dick
has
been
pulling
slowly
so
as
to
linger
out
the
time
here
how
do
you
feel
about
your
first
visit
to
these
waters
i
do
not
suppose
she
meant
a
trap
for
me
but
anyhow
i
fell
into
it
and
said
my
first
visit
it
is
not
my
first
visit
by
many
a
time
i
know
these
reaches
well
indeed
i
may
say
that
i
know
every
yard
of
the
thames
from
hammersmith
to
cricklade
i
saw
the
complications
that
might
follow
as
her
eyes
fixed
mine
with
a
curious
look
in
them
that
i
had
seen
before
at
runnymede
when
i
had
said
something
which
made
it
difficult
for
others
to
understand
my
present
position
amongst
these
people
i
reddened
and
said
in
order
to
cover
my
mistake
i
wonder
you
have
never
been
up
so
high
as
this
since
you
live
on
the
thames
and
moreover
row
so
well
that
it
would
be
no
great
labour
to
you
let
alone
quoth
i
insinuatingly
that
anybody
would
be
glad
to
row
you
she
laughed
clearly
not
at
my
compliment
as
i
am
sure
she
need
not
have
done
since
it
was
a
very
commonplace
fact
but
at
something
which
was
stirring
in
her
mind
and
she
still
looked
at
me
kindly
but
with
the
keen
look
in
her
eyes
and
then
she
said
well
perhaps
it
is
strange
though
i
have
a
good
deal
to
do
at
home
what
with
looking
after
my
father
and
dealing
with
two
or
three
young
men
who
have
taken
a
special
liking
to
me
and
all
of
whom
i
can
not
please
at
once
but
you
dear
neighbour
it
seems
to
me
stranger
that
you
should
know
the
upper
river
than
that
i
should
not
know
it
for
as
i
understand
you
have
only
been
in
england
a
few
days
but
perhaps
you
mean
that
you
have
read
about
it
in
books
and
seen
pictures
of
it
though
that
does
not
come
to
much
either
truly
said
i
besides
i
have
not
read
any
books
about
the
thames
it
was
one
of
the
minor
stupidities
of
our
time
that
no
one
thought
fit
to
write
a
decent
book
about
what
may
fairly
be
called
our
only
english
river
the
words
were
no
sooner
out
of
my
mouth
than
i
saw
that
i
had
made
another
mistake
and
i
felt
really
annoyed
with
myself
as
i
did
not
want
to
go
into
a
long
explanation
just
then
or
begin
another
series
of
odyssean
lies
somehow
ellen
seemed
to
see
this
and
she
took
no
advantage
of
my
slip
her
piercing
look
changed
into
one
of
mere
frank
kindness
and
she
said
well
anyhow
i
am
glad
that
i
am
travelling
these
waters
with
you
since
you
know
our
river
so
well
and
i
know
little
of
it
past
pangbourne
for
you
can
tell
me
all
i
want
to
know
about
it
she
paused
a
minute
and
then
said
yet
you
must
understand
that
the
part
i
do
know
i
know
as
thoroughly
as
you
do
i
should
be
sorry
for
you
to
think
that
i
am
careless
of
a
thing
so
beautiful
and
interesting
as
the
thames
she
said
this
quite
earnestly
and
with
an
air
of
affectionate
appeal
to
me
which
pleased
me
very
much
but
i
could
see
that
she
was
only
keeping
her
doubts
about
me
for
another
time
presently
we
came
to
day
lock
where
dick
and
his
two
sitters
had
waited
for
us
he
would
have
me
go
ashore
as
if
to
show
me
something
which
i
had
never
seen
before
and
nothing
loth
i
followed
him
ellen
by
my
side
to
the
dykes
and
the
long
church
beyond
them
which
was
still
used
for
various
purposes
by
the
good
folk
of
dorchester
where
by
the
way
the
village
still
had
the
sign
of
the
which
it
used
to
bear
in
the
days
when
hospitality
had
to
be
bought
and
sold
this
time
however
i
made
no
sign
of
all
this
being
familiar
to
me
though
as
we
sat
for
a
while
on
the
mound
of
the
dykes
looking
up
at
sinodun
and
its
trench
and
its
sister
of
whittenham
i
felt
somewhat
uncomfortable
under
ellen
serious
attentive
look
which
almost
drew
from
me
the
cry
how
little
anything
is
changed
here
we
stopped
again
at
abingdon
which
like
wallingford
was
in
a
way
both
old
and
new
to
me
since
it
had
been
lifted
out
of
its
degradation
and
otherwise
was
as
little
altered
as
might
be
sunset
was
in
the
sky
as
we
skirted
oxford
by
oseney
we
stopped
a
minute
or
two
hard
by
the
ancient
castle
to
put
henry
morsom
ashore
it
was
a
matter
of
course
that
so
far
as
they
could
be
seen
from
the
river
i
missed
none
of
the
towers
and
spires
of
that
once
city
but
the
meadows
all
round
which
when
i
had
last
passed
through
them
were
getting
daily
more
and
more
squalid
more
and
more
impressed
with
the
seal
of
the
stir
and
intellectual
life
of
the
nineteenth
century
were
no
longer
intellectual
but
had
once
again
become
as
beautiful
as
they
should
be
and
the
little
hill
of
hinksey
with
two
or
three
very
pretty
stone
houses
on
it
i
use
the
word
advisedly
for
they
seemed
to
belong
to
it
looked
down
happily
on
the
full
streams
and
waving
grass
grey
now
but
for
the
sunset
with
its
seeds
the
railway
having
disappeared
and
therewith
the
various
level
bridges
over
the
streams
of
thames
we
were
soon
through
medley
lock
and
in
the
wide
water
that
washes
port
meadow
with
its
numerous
population
of
geese
nowise
diminished
and
i
thought
with
interest
how
its
name
and
use
had
survived
from
the
older
imperfect
communal
period
through
the
time
of
the
confused
struggle
and
tyranny
of
the
rights
of
property
into
the
present
rest
and
happiness
of
complete
communism
i
was
taken
ashore
again
at
godstow
to
see
the
remains
of
the
old
nunnery
pretty
nearly
in
the
same
condition
as
i
had
remembered
them
and
from
the
high
bridge
over
the
cut
close
by
i
could
see
even
in
the
twilight
how
beautiful
the
little
village
with
its
grey
stone
houses
had
become
for
we
had
now
come
into
the
in
which
every
house
must
be
either
built
walls
and
roof
of
grey
stone
or
be
a
blot
on
the
landscape
we
still
rowed
on
after
this
ellen
taking
the
sculls
in
my
boat
we
passed
a
weir
a
little
higher
up
and
about
three
miles
beyond
it
came
by
moonlight
again
to
a
little
town
where
we
slept
at
a
house
thinly
inhabited
as
its
folk
were
mostly
tented
in
the
chapter
xxviii
the
little
river
we
started
before
six
the
next
morning
as
we
were
still
five
miles
from
our
resting
place
and
dick
wanted
to
be
there
before
dusk
the
journey
was
pleasant
though
to
those
who
do
not
know
the
upper
thames
there
is
little
to
say
about
it
ellen
and
i
were
once
more
together
in
her
boat
though
dick
for
fairness
sake
was
for
having
me
in
his
and
letting
the
two
women
scull
the
green
toy
ellen
however
would
not
allow
this
but
claimed
me
as
the
interesting
person
of
the
company
after
having
come
so
far
said
she
i
will
not
be
put
off
with
a
companion
who
will
be
always
thinking
of
somebody
else
than
me
the
guest
is
the
only
person
who
can
amuse
me
properly
i
mean
that
really
said
she
turning
to
me
and
have
not
said
it
merely
as
a
pretty
saying
clara
blushed
and
looked
very
happy
at
all
this
for
i
think
up
to
this
time
she
had
been
rather
frightened
of
ellen
as
for
me
i
felt
young
again
and
strange
hopes
of
my
youth
were
mingling
with
the
pleasure
of
the
present
almost
destroying
it
and
quickening
it
into
something
like
pain
as
we
passed
through
the
short
and
winding
reaches
of
the
now
quickly
lessening
stream
ellen
said
how
pleasant
this
little
river
is
to
me
who
am
used
to
a
great
wide
wash
of
water
it
almost
seems
as
if
we
shall
have
to
stop
at
every
i
expect
before
i
get
home
this
evening
i
shall
have
realised
what
a
little
country
england
is
since
we
can
so
soon
get
to
the
end
of
its
biggest
river
it
is
not
big
said
i
but
it
is
pretty
yes
she
said
and
do
you
find
it
difficult
to
imagine
the
times
when
this
little
pretty
country
was
treated
by
its
folk
as
if
it
had
been
an
ugly
characterless
waste
with
no
delicate
beauty
to
be
guarded
with
no
heed
taken
of
the
ever
fresh
pleasure
of
the
recurring
seasons
and
changeful
weather
and
diverse
quality
of
the
soil
and
so
forth
how
could
people
be
so
cruel
to
themselves
and
to
each
other
said
i
then
a
sudden
resolution
took
hold
of
me
and
i
said
dear
neighbour
i
may
as
well
tell
you
at
once
that
i
find
it
easier
to
imagine
all
that
ugly
past
than
you
do
because
i
myself
have
been
part
of
it
i
see
both
that
you
have
divined
something
of
this
in
me
and
also
i
think
you
will
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
of
it
so
that
i
am
going
to
hide
nothing
from
you
at
all
she
was
silent
a
little
and
then
she
said
my
friend
you
have
guessed
right
about
me
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
followed
you
up
from
runnymede
in
order
that
i
might
ask
you
many
questions
and
because
i
saw
that
you
were
not
one
of
us
and
that
interested
and
pleased
me
and
i
wanted
to
make
you
as
happy
as
you
could
be
to
say
the
truth
there
was
a
risk
in
it
said
she
blushing
i
mean
as
to
dick
and
clara
for
i
must
tell
you
since
we
are
going
to
be
such
close
friends
that
even
amongst
us
where
there
are
so
many
beautiful
women
i
have
often
troubled
men
minds
disastrously
that
is
one
reason
why
i
was
living
alone
with
my
father
in
the
cottage
at
runnymede
but
it
did
not
answer
on
that
score
for
of
course
people
came
there
as
the
place
is
not
a
desert
and
they
seemed
to
find
me
all
the
more
interesting
for
living
alone
like
that
and
fell
to
making
stories
of
me
to
themselves
like
i
know
you
did
my
friend
well
let
that
pass
this
evening
or
morning
i
shall
make
a
proposal
to
you
to
do
something
which
would
please
me
very
much
and
i
think
would
not
hurt
you
i
broke
in
eagerly
saying
that
i
would
do
anything
in
the
world
for
her
for
indeed
in
spite
of
my
years
and
the
too
obvious
signs
of
them
though
that
feeling
of
renewed
youth
was
not
a
mere
passing
sensation
i
think
in
spite
of
my
years
i
say
i
felt
altogether
too
happy
in
the
company
of
this
delightful
girl
and
was
prepared
to
take
her
confidences
for
more
than
they
meant
perhaps
she
laughed
now
but
looked
very
kindly
on
me
well
she
said
meantime
for
the
present
we
will
let
it
be
for
i
must
look
at
this
new
country
that
we
are
passing
through
see
how
the
river
has
changed
character
again
it
is
broad
now
and
the
reaches
are
long
and
very
running
and
look
there
is
a
ferry
i
told
her
the
name
of
it
as
i
slowed
off
to
put
the
over
our
heads
and
on
we
went
passing
by
a
bank
clad
with
oak
trees
on
our
left
hand
till
the
stream
narrowed
again
and
deepened
and
we
rowed
on
between
walls
of
tall
reeds
whose
population
of
reed
sparrows
and
warblers
were
delightfully
restless
twittering
and
chuckling
as
the
wash
of
the
boats
stirred
the
reeds
from
the
water
upwards
in
the
still
hot
morning
she
smiled
with
pleasure
and
her
lazy
enjoyment
of
the
new
scene
seemed
to
bring
out
her
beauty
doubly
as
she
leaned
back
amidst
the
cushions
though
she
was
far
from
languid
her
idleness
being
the
idleness
of
a
person
strong
and
both
in
body
and
mind
deliberately
resting
look
she
said
springing
up
suddenly
from
her
place
without
any
obvious
effort
and
balancing
herself
with
exquisite
grace
and
ease
look
at
the
beautiful
old
bridge
ahead
i
need
scarcely
look
at
that
said
i
not
turning
my
head
away
from
her
beauty
i
know
what
it
is
though
with
a
smile
we
used
not
to
call
it
the
old
bridge
time
agone
she
looked
down
upon
me
kindly
and
said
how
well
we
get
on
now
you
are
no
longer
on
your
guard
against
me
and
she
stood
looking
thoughtfully
at
me
still
till
she
had
to
sit
down
as
we
passed
under
the
middle
one
of
the
row
of
little
pointed
arches
of
the
oldest
bridge
across
the
thames
o
the
beautiful
fields
she
said
i
had
no
idea
of
the
charm
of
a
very
small
river
like
this
the
smallness
of
the
scale
of
everything
the
short
reaches
and
the
speedy
change
of
the
banks
give
one
a
feeling
of
going
somewhere
of
coming
to
something
strange
a
feeling
of
adventure
which
i
have
not
felt
in
bigger
waters
i
looked
up
at
her
delightedly
for
her
voice
saying
the
very
thing
which
i
was
thinking
was
like
a
caress
to
me
she
caught
my
eye
and
her
cheeks
reddened
under
their
tan
and
she
said
simply
i
must
tell
you
my
friend
that
when
my
father
leaves
the
thames
this
summer
he
will
take
me
away
to
a
place
near
the
roman
wall
in
cumberland
so
that
this
voyage
of
mine
is
farewell
to
the
south
of
course
with
my
goodwill
in
a
way
and
yet
i
am
sorry
for
it
i
had
the
heart
to
tell
dick
yesterday
that
we
were
as
good
as
gone
from
the
but
somehow
to
you
i
must
needs
tell
it
she
stopped
and
seemed
very
thoughtful
for
awhile
and
then
said
smiling
i
must
say
that
i
do
like
moving
about
from
one
home
to
another
one
gets
so
pleasantly
used
to
all
the
detail
of
the
life
about
one
it
fits
so
harmoniously
and
happily
into
one
own
life
that
beginning
again
even
in
a
small
way
is
a
kind
of
pain
but
i
daresay
in
the
country
which
you
come
from
you
would
think
this
petty
and
unadventurous
and
would
think
the
worse
of
me
for
it
she
smiled
at
me
caressingly
as
she
spoke
and
i
made
haste
to
answer
o
no
indeed
again
you
echo
my
very
thoughts
but
i
hardly
expected
to
hear
you
speak
so
i
gathered
from
all
i
have
heard
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
changing
of
abode
amongst
you
in
this
country
well
she
said
of
course
people
are
free
to
move
about
but
except
for
especially
in
harvest
and
like
this
of
ours
i
do
think
they
do
so
much
i
admit
that
i
also
have
other
moods
than
that
of
as
i
hinted
just
now
and
i
should
like
to
go
with
you
all
through
the
west
country
thinking
of
nothing
concluded
she
smiling
i
should
have
plenty
to
think
of
said
i
chapter
xxix
a
on
the
upper
thames
presently
at
a
place
where
the
river
flowed
round
a
headland
of
the
meadows
we
stopped
a
while
for
rest
and
victuals
and
settled
ourselves
on
a
beautiful
bank
which
almost
reached
the
dignity
of
a
the
wide
meadows
spread
before
us
and
already
the
scythe
was
busy
amidst
the
hay
one
change
i
noticed
amidst
the
quiet
beauty
of
the
fields
to
wit
that
they
were
planted
with
trees
here
and
there
often
and
that
there
was
none
of
the
niggardly
begrudging
of
space
to
a
handsome
tree
which
i
remembered
too
well
and
though
the
willows
were
often
polled
or
shrowded
as
they
call
it
in
that
this
was
done
with
some
regard
to
beauty
i
mean
that
there
was
no
polling
of
rows
on
rows
so
as
to
destroy
the
pleasantness
of
half
a
mile
of
country
but
a
thoughtful
sequence
in
the
cutting
that
prevented
a
sudden
bareness
anywhere
to
be
short
the
fields
were
everywhere
treated
as
a
garden
made
for
the
pleasure
as
well
as
the
livelihood
of
all
as
old
hammond
told
me
was
the
case
on
this
bank
or
bent
of
the
hill
then
we
had
our
meal
somewhat
early
for
dinner
if
that
mattered
but
we
had
been
stirring
early
the
slender
stream
of
the
thames
winding
below
us
between
the
garden
of
a
country
i
have
been
telling
of
a
furlong
from
us
was
a
beautiful
little
islet
begrown
with
graceful
trees
on
the
slopes
westward
of
us
was
a
wood
of
varied
growth
overhanging
the
narrow
meadow
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
while
to
the
north
was
a
wide
stretch
of
mead
rising
very
gradually
from
the
river
edge
a
delicate
spire
of
an
ancient
building
rose
up
from
out
of
the
trees
in
the
middle
distance
with
a
few
grey
houses
clustered
about
it
while
nearer
to
us
in
fact
not
half
a
furlong
from
the
water
was
a
quite
modern
stone
house
a
wide
quadrangle
of
one
story
the
buildings
that
made
it
being
quite
low
there
was
no
garden
between
it
and
the
river
nothing
but
a
row
of
still
quite
young
and
slender
and
though
there
did
not
seem
to
be
much
ornament
about
it
it
had
a
sort
of
natural
elegance
like
that
of
the
trees
themselves
as
we
sat
looking
down
on
all
this
in
the
sweet
june
day
rather
happy
than
merry
ellen
who
sat
next
me
her
hand
clasped
about
one
knee
leaned
sideways
to
me
and
said
in
a
low
voice
which
dick
and
clara
might
have
noted
if
they
had
not
been
busy
in
happy
wordless
friend
in
your
country
were
the
houses
of
your
anything
like
that
i
said
well
at
any
rate
the
houses
of
our
rich
men
were
not
they
were
mere
blots
upon
the
face
of
the
land
i
find
that
hard
to
understand
she
said
i
can
see
why
the
workmen
who
were
so
oppressed
should
not
have
been
able
to
live
in
beautiful
houses
for
it
takes
time
and
leisure
and
minds
not
with
care
to
make
beautiful
dwellings
and
i
quite
understand
that
these
poor
people
were
not
allowed
to
live
in
such
a
way
as
to
have
these
to
us
necessary
good
things
but
why
the
rich
men
who
had
the
time
and
the
leisure
and
the
materials
for
building
as
it
would
be
in
this
case
should
not
have
housed
themselves
well
i
do
not
understand
as
yet
i
know
what
you
are
meaning
to
say
to
me
she
said
looking
me
full
in
the
eyes
and
blushing
to
wit
that
their
houses
and
all
belonging
to
them
were
generally
ugly
and
base
unless
they
chanced
to
be
ancient
like
yonder
remnant
of
our
forefathers
work
pointing
to
the
spire
that
they
were
let
me
see
what
is
the
word
vulgar
said
i
we
used
to
say
said
i
that
the
ugliness
and
vulgarity
of
the
rich
men
dwellings
was
a
necessary
reflection
from
the
sordidness
and
bareness
of
life
which
they
forced
upon
the
poor
people
she
knit
her
brows
as
in
thought
then
turned
a
brightened
face
on
me
as
if
she
had
caught
the
idea
and
said
yes
friend
i
see
what
you
mean
we
have
sometimes
those
of
us
who
look
into
these
things
talked
this
very
matter
over
because
to
say
the
truth
we
have
plenty
of
record
of
the
arts
of
the
time
before
equality
of
life
and
there
are
not
wanting
people
who
say
that
the
state
of
that
society
was
not
the
cause
of
all
that
ugliness
that
they
were
ugly
in
their
life
because
they
liked
to
be
and
could
have
had
beautiful
things
about
them
if
they
had
chosen
just
as
a
man
or
body
of
men
now
may
if
they
please
make
things
more
or
less
beautiful
stop
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
do
you
said
i
smiling
yet
with
a
beating
heart
yes
she
said
you
are
answering
me
teaching
me
in
some
way
or
another
although
you
have
not
spoken
the
words
aloud
you
were
going
to
say
that
in
times
of
inequality
it
was
an
essential
condition
of
the
life
of
these
rich
men
that
they
should
not
themselves
make
what
they
wanted
for
the
adornment
of
their
lives
but
should
force
those
to
make
them
whom
they
forced
to
live
pinched
and
sordid
lives
and
that
as
a
necessary
consequence
the
sordidness
and
pinching
the
ugly
barrenness
of
those
ruined
lives
were
worked
up
into
the
adornment
of
the
lives
of
the
rich
and
art
died
out
amongst
men
was
that
what
you
would
say
my
friend
yes
yes
i
said
looking
at
her
eagerly
for
she
had
risen
and
was
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
bent
the
light
wind
stirring
her
dainty
raiment
one
hand
laid
on
her
bosom
the
other
arm
stretched
downward
and
clenched
in
her
earnestness
it
is
true
she
said
it
is
true
we
have
proved
it
true
i
think
amidst
my
something
more
than
interest
in
her
and
admiration
for
her
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
how
it
would
all
end
i
had
a
glimmering
of
fear
of
what
might
follow
of
anxiety
as
to
the
remedy
which
this
new
age
might
offer
for
the
missing
of
something
one
might
set
one
heart
on
but
now
dick
rose
to
his
feet
and
cried
out
in
his
hearty
manner
neighbour
ellen
are
you
quarrelling
with
the
guest
or
are
you
worrying
him
to
tell
you
things
which
he
can
not
properly
explain
to
our
ignorance
neither
dear
neighbour
she
said
i
was
so
far
from
quarrelling
with
him
that
i
think
i
have
been
making
him
good
friends
both
with
himself
and
me
is
it
so
dear
guest
she
said
looking
down
at
me
with
a
delightful
smile
of
confidence
in
being
understood
indeed
it
is
said
i
well
moreover
she
said
i
must
say
for
him
that
he
has
explained
himself
to
me
very
well
indeed
so
that
i
quite
understand
him
all
right
quoth
dick
when
i
first
set
eyes
on
you
at
runnymede
i
knew
that
there
was
something
wonderful
in
your
keenness
of
wits
i
do
say
that
as
a
mere
pretty
speech
to
please
you
said
he
quickly
but
because
it
is
true
and
it
made
me
want
to
see
more
of
you
but
come
we
ought
to
be
going
for
we
are
not
half
way
and
we
ought
to
be
in
well
before
sunset
and
therewith
he
took
clara
hand
and
led
her
down
the
bent
but
ellen
stood
thoughtfully
looking
down
for
a
little
and
as
i
took
her
hand
to
follow
dick
she
turned
round
to
me
and
said
you
might
tell
me
a
great
deal
and
make
many
things
clear
to
me
if
you
would
yes
said
i
i
am
pretty
well
fit
for
that
and
for
nothing
else
an
old
man
like
me
she
did
not
notice
the
bitterness
which
whether
i
liked
it
or
not
was
in
my
voice
as
i
spoke
but
went
on
it
is
not
so
much
for
myself
i
should
be
quite
content
to
dream
about
past
times
and
if
i
could
not
idealise
them
yet
at
least
idealise
some
of
the
people
who
lived
in
them
but
i
think
sometimes
people
are
too
careless
of
the
history
of
the
past
too
apt
to
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
old
learned
men
like
hammond
who
knows
happy
as
we
are
times
may
alter
we
may
be
bitten
with
some
impulse
towards
change
and
many
things
may
seem
too
wonderful
for
us
to
resist
too
exciting
not
to
catch
at
if
we
do
not
know
that
they
are
but
phases
of
what
has
been
before
and
withal
ruinous
deceitful
and
sordid
as
we
went
slowly
down
toward
the
boats
she
said
again
not
for
myself
alone
dear
friend
i
shall
have
children
perhaps
before
the
end
a
good
many
i
hope
so
and
though
of
course
i
can
not
force
any
special
kind
of
knowledge
upon
them
yet
my
friend
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
just
as
they
might
be
like
me
in
body
so
i
might
impress
upon
them
some
part
of
my
ways
of
thinking
that
is
indeed
some
of
the
essential
part
of
myself
that
part
which
was
not
mere
moods
created
by
the
matters
and
events
round
about
me
what
do
you
think
of
one
thing
i
was
sure
that
her
beauty
and
kindness
and
eagerness
combined
forced
me
to
think
as
she
did
when
she
was
not
earnestly
laying
herself
open
to
receive
my
thoughts
i
said
what
at
the
time
was
true
that
i
thought
it
most
important
and
presently
stood
entranced
by
the
wonder
of
her
grace
as
she
stepped
into
the
light
boat
and
held
out
her
hand
to
me
and
so
on
we
went
up
the
thames
still
or
whither
chapter
xxx
the
journey
end
on
we
went
in
spite
of
my
excitement
about
ellen
and
my
gathering
fear
of
where
it
would
land
me
i
could
not
help
taking
abundant
interest
in
the
condition
of
the
river
and
its
banks
all
the
more
as
she
never
seemed
weary
of
the
changing
picture
but
looked
at
every
yard
of
flowery
bank
and
gurgling
eddy
with
the
same
kind
of
affectionate
interest
which
i
myself
once
had
so
fully
as
i
used
to
think
and
perhaps
had
not
altogether
lost
even
in
this
strangely
changed
society
with
all
its
wonders
ellen
seemed
delighted
with
my
pleasure
at
this
that
or
the
other
piece
of
carefulness
in
dealing
with
the
river
the
nursing
of
pretty
corners
the
ingenuity
in
dealing
with
difficulties
of
so
that
the
most
obviously
useful
works
looked
beautiful
and
natural
also
all
this
i
say
pleased
me
hugely
and
she
was
pleased
at
my
pleasure
but
rather
puzzled
too
you
seem
astonished
she
said
just
after
we
had
passed
a
mill
which
spanned
all
the
stream
save
the
for
traffic
but
which
was
as
beautiful
in
its
way
as
a
gothic
cathedral
you
seem
astonished
at
this
being
so
pleasant
to
look
at
yes
i
said
in
a
way
i
am
though
i
do
see
why
it
should
not
be
ah
she
said
looking
at
me
admiringly
yet
with
a
lurking
smile
in
her
face
you
know
all
about
the
history
of
the
past
were
they
not
always
careful
about
this
little
stream
which
now
adds
so
much
pleasantness
to
the
country
side
it
would
always
be
easy
to
manage
this
little
river
ah
i
forgot
though
she
said
as
her
eye
caught
mine
in
the
days
we
are
thinking
of
pleasure
was
wholly
neglected
in
such
matters
but
how
did
they
manage
the
river
in
the
days
that
you
lived
in
she
was
going
to
say
but
correcting
herself
said
in
the
days
of
which
you
have
record
they
it
quoth
i
up
to
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
when
it
was
still
more
or
less
of
a
highway
for
the
country
people
some
care
was
taken
of
the
river
and
its
banks
and
though
i
do
suppose
anyone
troubled
himself
about
its
aspect
yet
it
was
trim
and
beautiful
but
when
the
railways
of
which
no
doubt
you
have
heard
came
into
power
they
would
not
allow
the
people
of
the
country
to
use
either
the
natural
or
artificial
waterways
of
which
latter
there
were
a
great
many
i
suppose
when
we
get
higher
up
we
shall
see
one
of
these
a
very
important
one
which
one
of
these
railways
entirely
closed
to
the
public
so
that
they
might
force
people
to
send
their
goods
by
their
private
road
and
so
tax
them
as
heavily
as
they
could
ellen
laughed
heartily
well
she
said
that
is
not
stated
clearly
enough
in
our
and
it
is
worth
knowing
but
certainly
the
people
of
those
days
must
have
been
a
curiously
lazy
set
we
are
not
either
fidgety
or
quarrelsome
now
but
if
any
one
tried
such
a
piece
of
folly
on
us
we
should
use
the
said
waterways
whoever
gainsaid
us
surely
that
would
be
simple
enough
however
i
remember
other
cases
of
this
stupidity
when
i
was
on
the
rhine
two
years
ago
i
remember
they
showed
us
ruins
of
old
castles
which
according
to
what
we
heard
must
have
been
made
for
pretty
much
the
same
purpose
as
the
railways
were
but
i
am
interrupting
your
history
of
the
river
pray
go
on
it
is
both
short
and
stupid
enough
said
i
the
river
having
lost
its
practical
or
commercial
value
that
is
being
of
no
use
to
make
money
of
she
nodded
i
understand
what
that
queer
phrase
means
said
she
go
on
well
it
was
utterly
neglected
till
at
last
it
became
a
nuisance
yes
quoth
ellen
i
understand
like
the
railways
and
the
robber
knights
yes
so
then
they
turned
the
makeshift
business
on
to
it
and
handed
it
over
to
a
body
up
in
london
who
from
time
to
time
in
order
to
show
that
they
had
something
to
do
did
some
damage
here
and
there
cut
down
trees
destroying
the
banks
thereby
dredged
the
river
where
it
was
not
needed
always
and
threw
the
dredgings
on
the
fields
so
as
to
spoil
them
and
so
forth
but
for
the
most
part
they
practised
inactivity
as
it
was
then
called
that
is
they
drew
their
salaries
and
let
things
alone
drew
their
salaries
she
said
i
know
that
means
that
they
were
allowed
to
take
an
extra
lot
of
other
people
goods
for
doing
nothing
and
if
that
had
been
all
it
really
might
have
been
worth
while
to
let
them
do
so
if
you
could
find
any
other
way
of
keeping
them
quiet
but
it
seems
to
me
that
being
so
paid
they
could
not
help
doing
something
and
that
something
was
bound
to
be
mischief
because
said
she
kindling
with
sudden
anger
the
whole
business
was
founded
on
lies
and
false
pretensions
i
do
mean
only
these
but
all
these
i
have
read
of
yes
said
i
how
happy
you
are
to
have
got
out
of
the
parsimony
of
oppression
why
do
you
sigh
she
said
kindly
and
somewhat
anxiously
you
seem
to
think
that
it
will
not
last
it
will
last
for
you
quoth
i
but
why
not
for
you
said
she
surely
it
is
for
all
the
world
and
if
your
country
is
somewhat
backward
it
will
come
into
line
before
long
or
she
said
quickly
are
you
thinking
that
you
must
soon
go
back
again
i
will
make
my
proposal
which
i
told
you
of
at
once
and
so
perhaps
put
an
end
to
your
anxiety
i
was
going
to
propose
that
you
should
live
with
us
where
we
are
going
i
feel
quite
old
friends
with
you
and
should
be
sorry
to
lose
you
then
she
smiled
on
me
and
said
do
you
know
i
begin
to
suspect
you
of
wanting
to
nurse
a
sham
sorrow
like
the
ridiculous
characters
in
some
of
those
queer
old
novels
that
i
have
come
across
now
and
then
i
really
had
almost
begun
to
suspect
it
myself
but
i
refused
to
admit
so
much
so
i
sighed
no
more
but
fell
to
giving
my
delightful
companion
what
little
pieces
of
history
i
knew
about
the
river
and
its
borderlands
and
the
time
passed
pleasantly
enough
and
between
the
two
of
us
she
was
a
better
sculler
than
i
was
and
seemed
quite
tireless
we
kept
up
fairly
well
with
dick
hot
as
the
afternoon
was
and
swallowed
up
the
way
at
a
great
rate
at
last
we
passed
under
another
ancient
bridge
and
through
meadows
bordered
at
first
with
huge
mingled
with
sweet
chestnut
of
younger
but
very
elegant
growth
and
the
meadows
widened
out
so
much
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
trees
must
now
be
on
the
bents
only
or
about
the
houses
except
for
the
growth
of
willows
on
the
immediate
banks
so
that
the
wide
stretch
of
grass
was
little
broken
here
dick
got
very
much
excited
now
and
often
stood
up
in
the
boat
to
cry
out
to
us
that
this
was
such
and
such
a
field
and
so
forth
and
we
caught
fire
at
his
enthusiasm
for
the
and
its
harvest
and
pulled
our
best
at
last
as
we
were
passing
through
a
reach
of
the
river
where
on
the
side
of
the
was
a
highish
bank
with
a
thick
whispering
bed
of
reeds
before
it
and
on
the
other
side
a
higher
bank
clothed
with
willows
that
dipped
into
the
stream
and
crowned
by
ancient
we
saw
bright
figures
coming
along
close
to
the
bank
as
if
they
were
looking
for
something
as
indeed
they
were
and
we
that
is
dick
and
his
company
were
what
they
were
looking
for
dick
lay
on
his
oars
and
we
followed
his
example
he
gave
a
joyous
shout
to
the
people
on
the
bank
which
was
echoed
back
from
it
in
many
voices
deep
and
sweetly
shrill
for
there
were
above
a
dozen
persons
both
men
women
and
children
a
tall
handsome
woman
with
black
wavy
hair
and
grey
eyes
came
forward
on
the
bank
and
waved
her
hand
gracefully
to
us
and
said
dick
my
friend
we
have
almost
had
to
wait
for
you
what
excuse
have
you
to
make
for
your
slavish
punctuality
why
did
you
take
us
by
surprise
and
come
yesterday
o
said
dick
with
an
almost
imperceptible
jerk
of
his
head
toward
our
boat
we
did
want
to
come
too
quick
up
the
water
there
is
so
much
to
see
for
those
who
have
not
been
up
here
before
true
true
said
the
stately
lady
for
stately
is
the
word
that
must
be
used
for
her
and
we
want
them
to
get
to
know
the
wet
way
from
the
east
thoroughly
well
since
they
must
often
use
it
now
but
come
ashore
at
once
dick
and
you
dear
neighbours
there
is
a
break
in
the
reeds
and
a
good
just
round
the
corner
we
can
carry
up
your
things
or
send
some
of
the
lads
after
them
no
no
said
dick
it
is
easier
going
by
water
though
it
is
but
a
step
besides
i
want
to
bring
my
friend
here
to
the
proper
place
we
will
go
on
to
the
ford
and
you
can
talk
to
us
from
the
bank
as
we
paddle
along
he
pulled
his
sculls
through
the
water
and
on
we
went
turning
a
sharp
angle
and
going
north
a
little
presently
we
saw
before
us
a
bank
of
trees
which
told
us
of
a
house
amidst
them
though
i
looked
in
vain
for
the
grey
walls
that
i
expected
to
see
there
as
we
went
the
folk
on
the
bank
talked
indeed
mingling
their
kind
voices
with
the
cuckoo
song
the
sweet
strong
whistle
of
the
blackbirds
and
the
ceaseless
note
of
the
as
he
crept
through
the
long
grass
of
the
whence
came
waves
of
fragrance
from
the
flowering
clover
amidst
of
the
ripe
grass
in
a
few
minutes
we
had
passed
through
a
deep
eddying
pool
into
the
sharp
stream
that
ran
from
the
ford
and
beached
our
craft
on
a
tiny
strand
of
and
stepped
ashore
into
the
arms
of
our
friends
our
journey
done
i
disentangled
myself
from
the
merry
throng
and
mounting
on
the
road
that
ran
along
the
river
some
feet
above
the
water
i
looked
round
about
me
the
river
came
down
through
a
wide
meadow
on
my
left
which
was
grey
now
with
the
ripened
seeding
grasses
the
gleaming
water
was
lost
presently
by
a
turn
of
the
bank
but
over
the
meadow
i
could
see
the
mingled
gables
of
a
building
where
i
knew
the
lock
must
be
and
which
now
seemed
to
combine
a
mill
with
it
a
low
wooded
ridge
bounded
the
plain
to
the
south
and
whence
we
had
come
and
a
few
low
houses
lay
about
its
feet
and
up
its
slope
i
turned
a
little
to
my
right
and
through
the
hawthorn
sprays
and
long
shoots
of
the
wild
roses
could
see
the
flat
country
spreading
out
far
away
under
the
sun
of
the
calm
evening
till
something
that
might
be
called
hills
with
a
look
of
about
them
bounded
it
with
a
soft
blue
line
before
me
the
still
hid
most
of
what
houses
there
might
be
in
this
side
dwelling
of
men
but
to
the
right
of
the
a
few
grey
buildings
of
the
simplest
kind
showed
here
and
there
there
i
stood
in
a
dreamy
mood
and
rubbed
my
eyes
as
if
i
were
not
wholly
awake
and
half
expected
to
see
the
company
of
beautiful
men
and
women
change
to
two
or
three
men
and
haggard
women
who
once
wore
down
the
soil
of
this
land
with
their
heavy
hopeless
feet
from
day
to
day
and
season
to
season
and
year
to
year
but
no
change
came
as
yet
and
my
heart
swelled
with
joy
as
i
thought
of
all
the
beautiful
grey
villages
from
the
river
to
the
plain
and
the
plain
to
the
uplands
which
i
could
picture
to
myself
so
well
all
peopled
now
with
this
happy
and
lovely
folk
who
had
cast
away
riches
and
attained
to
wealth
chapter

an
old
house
amongst
new
folk
as
i
stood
there
ellen
detached
herself
from
our
happy
friends
who
still
stood
on
the
little
strand
and
came
up
to
me
she
took
me
by
the
hand
and
said
softly
take
me
on
to
the
house
at

we
need
not

for

others
i
had
rather
not
i
had
a
mind
to
say
that
i
did
not
know
the
way
thither
and
that
the
dwellers
should
lead
but
almost
without
my
will
my
feet
moved
on
along
the
road
they
knew
the
raised
way
led
us
into
a
little
field
bounded
by
a
backwater
of
the
river
on
one
side
on
the
right
hand
we
could
see
a
cluster
of
small
houses
and
barns
new
and
old
and
before
us
a
grey
stone
barn
and
a
wall
partly
overgrown
with
ivy
over
which
a
few
grey
gables
showed
the
village
road
ended
in
the
shallow
of
the
aforesaid
backwater
we
crossed
the
road
and
again
almost
without
my
will
my
hand
raised
the
latch
of
a
door
in
the
wall
and
we
stood
presently
on
a
stone
path
which
led
up
to
the
old
house
to
which
fate
in
the
shape
of
dick
had
so
strangely
brought
me
in
this
new
world
of
men
my
companion
gave
a
sigh
of
pleased
surprise
and
enjoyment
nor
did
i
wonder
for
the
garden
between
the
wall
and
the
house
was
redolent
of
the
june
flowers
and
the
roses
were
rolling
over
one
another
with
that
delicious
superabundance
of
small
gardens
which
at
first
sight
takes
away
all
thought
from
the
beholder
save
that
of
beauty
the
blackbirds
were
singing
their
loudest
the
doves
were
cooing
on
the
ridge
the
rooks
in
the
high
beyond
were
garrulous
among
the
young
leaves
and
the
swifts
wheeled
whining
about
the
gables
and
the
house
itself
was
a
fit
guardian
for
all
the
beauty
of
this
heart
of
summer
once
again
ellen
echoed
my
thoughts
as
she
said
yes
friend
this
is
what
i
came
out
for
to
see
this
old
house
built
by
the
simple
of
the
times
regardless
of
all
the
turmoil
that
was
going
on
in
cities
and
courts
is
lovely
still
amidst
all
the
beauty
which
these
latter
days
have
created
and
i
do
not
wonder
at
our
friends
tending
it
carefully
and
making
much
of
it
it
seems
to
me
as
if
it
had
waited
for
these
happy
days
and
held
in
it
the
gathered
crumbs
of
happiness
of
the
confused
and
turbulent
past
she
led
me
up
close
to
the
house
and
laid
her
shapely
hand
and
arm
on
the
lichened
wall
as
if
to
embrace
it
and
cried
out
o
me
o
me
how
i
love
the
earth
and
the
seasons
and
weather
and
all
things
that
deal
with
it
and
all
that
grows
out
of
it
as
this
has
done
i
could
not
answer
her
or
say
a
word
her
exultation
and
pleasure
were
so
keen
and
exquisite
and
her
beauty
so
delicate
yet
so
interfused
with
energy
expressed
it
so
fully
that
any
added
word
would
have
been
commonplace
and
futile
i
dreaded
lest
the
others
should
come
in
suddenly
and
break
the
spell
she
had
cast
about
me
but
we
stood
there
a
while
by
the
corner
of
the
big
gable
of
the
house
and
no
one
came
i
heard
the
merry
voices
some
way
off
presently
and
knew
that
they
were
going
along
the
river
to
the
great
meadow
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
and
garden
we
drew
back
a
little
and
looked
up
at
the
house
the
door
and
the
windows
were
open
to
the
fragrant
air
from
the
upper
sills
hung
festoons
of
flowers
in
honour
of
the
festival
as
if
the
others
shared
in
the
love
for
the
old
house
come
in
said
ellen
i
hope
nothing
will
spoil
it
inside
but
i
think
it
will
come
we
must
go
back
presently
to
the
others
they
have
gone
on
to
the
tents
for
surely
they
must
have
tents
pitched
for
the
haymakers
the
house
would
not
hold
a
tithe
of
the
folk
i
am
sure
she
led
me
on
to
the
door
murmuring
little
above
her
breath
as
she
did
so
the
earth
and
the
growth
of
it
and
the
life
of
it
if
i
could
but
say
or
show
how
i
love
it
we
went
in
and
found
no
soul
in
any
room
as
we
wandered
from
room
to
room
from
the
porch
to
the
strange
and
quaint
garrets
amongst
the
great
timbers
of
the
roof
where
of
old
time
the
tillers
and
herdsmen
of
the
manor
slept
but
which
seemed
now
by
the
small
size
of
the
beds
and
the
litter
of
useless
and
disregarded
matters
bunches
of
dying
flowers
feathers
of
birds
shells
of
starling
eggs
caddis
worms
in
mugs
and
the
like
seemed
to
be
inhabited
for
the
time
by
children
everywhere
there
was
but
little
furniture
and
that
only
the
most
necessary
and
of
the
simplest
forms
the
extravagant
love
of
ornament
which
i
had
noted
in
this
people
elsewhere
seemed
here
to
have
given
place
to
the
feeling
that
the
house
itself
and
its
associations
was
the
ornament
of
the
country
life
amidst
which
it
had
been
left
stranded
from
old
times
and
that
to
it
would
but
take
away
its
use
as
a
piece
of
natural
beauty
we
sat
down
at
last
in
a
room
over
the
wall
which
ellen
had
caressed
and
which
was
still
hung
with
old
tapestry
originally
of
no
artistic
value
but
now
faded
into
pleasant
grey
tones
which
harmonised
thoroughly
well
with
the
quiet
of
the
place
and
which
would
have
been
ill
supplanted
by
brighter
and
more
striking
decoration
i
asked
a
few
random
questions
of
ellen
as
we
sat
there
but
scarcely
listened
to
her
answers
and
presently
became
silent
and
then
scarce
conscious
of
anything
but
that
i
was
there
in
that
old
room
the
doves
crooning
from
the
roofs
of
the
barn
and
dovecot
beyond
the
window
opposite
to
me
my
thought
returned
to
me
after
what
i
think
was
but
a
minute
or
two
but
which
as
in
a
vivid
dream
seemed
as
if
it
had
lasted
a
long
time
when
i
saw
ellen
sitting
looking
all
the
fuller
of
life
and
pleasure
and
desire
from
the
contrast
with
the
grey
faded
tapestry
with
its
futile
design
which
was
now
only
bearable
because
it
had
grown
so
faint
and
feeble
she
looked
at
me
kindly
but
as
if
she
read
me
through
and
through
she
said
you
have
begun
again
your
contrast
between
the
past
and
this
present
is
it
not
so
true
said
i
i
was
thinking
of
what
you
with
your
capacity
and
intelligence
joined
to
your
love
of
pleasure
and
your
impatience
of
unreasonable
restraint
of
what
you
would
have
been
in
that
past
and
even
now
when
all
is
won
and
has
been
for
a
long
time
my
heart
is
sickened
with
thinking
of
all
the
waste
of
life
that
has
gone
on
for
so
many
years
so
many
centuries
she
said
so
many
ages
true
i
said
too
true
and
sat
silent
again
she
rose
up
and
said
come
i
must
not
let
you
go
off
into
a
dream
again
so
soon
if
we
must
lose
you
i
want
you
to
see
all
that
you
can
see
first
before
you
go
back
again
lose
me
i
said
go
back
again
am
i
not
to
go
up
to
the
north
with
you
what
do
you
mean
she
smiled
somewhat
sadly
and
said
not
yet
we
will
not
talk
of
that
yet
only
what
were
you
thinking
of
just
now
i
said
falteringly
i
was
saying
to
myself
the
past
the
present
should
she
not
have
said
the
contrast
of
the
present
with
the
future
of
blind
despair
with
hope
i
knew
it
she
said
then
she
caught
my
hand
and
said
excitedly
come
while
there
is
yet
time
come
and
she
led
me
out
of
the
room
and
as
we
were
going
downstairs
and
out
of
the
house
into
the
garden
by
a
little
side
door
which
opened
out
of
a
curious
lobby
she
said
in
a
calm
voice
as
if
she
wished
me
to
forget
her
sudden
nervousness
come
we
ought
to
join
the
others
before
they
come
here
looking
for
us
and
let
me
tell
you
my
friend
that
i
can
see
you
are
too
apt
to
fall
into
mere
dreamy
musing
no
doubt
because
you
are
not
yet
used
to
our
life
of
repose
amidst
of
energy
of
work
which
is
pleasure
and
pleasure
which
is
work
she
paused
a
little
and
as
we
came
out
into
the
lovely
garden
again
she
said
my
friend
you
were
saying
that
you
wondered
what
i
should
have
been
if
i
had
lived
in
those
past
days
of
turmoil
and
oppression
well
i
think
i
have
studied
the
history
of
them
to
know
pretty
well
i
should
have
been
one
of
the
poor
for
my
father
when
he
was
working
was
a
mere
tiller
of
the
soil
well
i
could
not
have
borne
that
therefore
my
beauty
and
cleverness
and
brightness
she
spoke
with
no
blush
or
simper
of
false
shame
would
have
been
sold
to
rich
men
and
my
life
would
have
been
wasted
indeed
for
i
know
enough
of
that
to
know
that
i
should
have
had
no
choice
no
power
of
will
over
my
life
and
that
i
should
never
have
bought
pleasure
from
the
rich
men
or
even
opportunity
of
action
whereby
i
might
have
won
some
true
excitement
i
should
have
wrecked
and
wasted
in
one
way
or
another
either
by
penury
or
by
luxury
is
it
not
so
indeed
it
is
said
i
she
was
going
to
say
something
else
when
a
little
gate
in
the
fence
which
led
into
a
small
field
was
opened
and
dick
came
with
hasty
cheerfulness
up
the
garden
path
and
was
presently
standing
between
us
a
hand
laid
on
the
shoulder
of
each
he
said
well
neighbours
i
thought
you
two
would
like
to
see
the
old
house
quietly
without
a
crowd
in
it
is
it
a
jewel
of
a
house
after
its
kind
well
come
along
for
it
is
getting
towards
perhaps
you
guest
would
like
a
swim
before
we
sit
down
to
what
i
fancy
will
be
a
pretty
long
feast
yes
i
said
i
should
like
that
well
for
the
present
neighbour
ellen
said
dick
here
comes
clara
to
take
care
of
you
as
i
fancy
she
is
more
at
home
amongst
our
friends
here
clara
came
out
of
the
fields
as
he
spoke
and
with
one
look
at
ellen
i
turned
and
went
with
dick
doubting
if
i
must
say
the
truth
whether
i
should
see
her
again
chapter
xxxii
the
feast
beginning
the
end
dick
brought
me
at
once
into
the
little
field
which
as
i
had
seen
from
the
garden
was
covered
with
tents
arranged
in
orderly
lanes
about
which
were
sitting
and
lying
on
the
grass
some
fifty
or
sixty
men
women
and
children
all
of
them
in
the
height
of
good
temper
and
enjoyment
with
their
holiday
mood
on
so
to
say
you
are
thinking
that
we
do
make
a
great
show
as
to
numbers
said
dick
but
you
must
remember
that
we
shall
have
more
because
in
this
haymaking
work
there
is
room
for
a
great
many
people
who
are
not
in
country
matters
and
there
are
many
who
lead
sedentary
lives
whom
it
would
be
unkind
to
deprive
of
their
pleasure
in
the
field
scientific
men
and
close
students
generally
so
that
the
skilled
workmen
outside
those
who
are
wanted
as
mowers
and
foremen
of
the
haymaking
stand
aside
and
take
a
little
downright
rest
which
you
know
is
good
for
them
whether
they
like
it
or
not
or
else
they
go
to
other
countrysides
as
i
am
doing
here
you
see
the
scientific
men
and
historians
and
students
generally
will
not
be
wanted
till
we
are
fairly
in
the
midst
of
the
tedding
which
of
course
will
not
be
till
the
day
after
with
that
he
brought
me
out
of
the
little
field
on
to
a
kind
of
causeway
above
the
meadow
and
thence
turning
to
the
left
on
to
a
path
through
the
mowing
grass
which
was
thick
and
very
tall
led
on
till
we
came
to
the
river
above
the
weir
and
its
mill
there
we
had
a
delightful
swim
in
the
broad
piece
of
water
above
the
lock
where
the
river
looked
much
bigger
than
its
natural
size
from
its
being
dammed
up
by
the
weir
now
we
are
in
a
fit
mood
for
dinner
said
dick
when
we
had
dressed
and
were
going
through
the
grass
again
and
certainly
of
all
the
cheerful
meals
in
the
year
this
one
of
haysel
is
the
cheerfullest
not
even
excepting
the
feast
for
then
the
year
is
beginning
to
fail
and
one
can
not
help
having
a
feeling
behind
all
the
gaiety
of
the
coming
of
the
dark
days
and
the
shorn
fields
and
empty
gardens
and
the
spring
is
almost
too
far
off
to
look
forward
to
it
is
then
in
the
autumn
when
one
almost
believes
in
death
how
strangely
you
talk
said
i
of
such
a
constantly
recurring
and
consequently
commonplace
matter
as
the
sequence
of
the
seasons
and
indeed
these
people
were
like
children
about
such
things
and
had
what
seemed
to
me
a
quite
exaggerated
interest
in
the
weather
a
fine
day
a
dark
night
or
a
brilliant
one
and
the
like
strangely
said
he
is
it
strange
to
sympathise
with
the
year
and
its
gains
and
losses
at
any
rate
said
i
if
you
look
upon
the
course
of
the
year
as
a
beautiful
and
interesting
drama
which
is
what
i
think
you
do
you
should
be
as
much
pleased
and
interested
with
the
winter
and
its
trouble
and
pain
as
with
this
wonderful
summer
luxury
and
am
i
not
said
dick
rather
warmly
only
i
ca
look
upon
it
as
if
i
were
sitting
in
a
theatre
seeing
the
play
going
on
before
me
myself
taking
no
part
of
it
it
is
difficult
said
he
smiling
for
a
man
like
me
to
explain
myself
properly
like
that
dear
girl
ellen
would
but
i
mean
that
i
am
part
of
it
all
and
feel
the
pain
as
well
as
the
pleasure
in
my
own
person
it
is
not
done
for
me
by
somebody
else
merely
that
i
may
eat
and
drink
and
sleep
but
i
myself
do
my
share
of
it
in
his
way
also
as
ellen
in
hers
i
could
see
that
dick
had
that
passionate
love
of
the
earth
which
was
common
to
but
few
people
at
least
in
the
days
i
knew
in
which
the
prevailing
feeling
amongst
intellectual
persons
was
a
kind
of
sour
distaste
for
the
changing
drama
of
the
year
for
the
life
of
earth
and
its
dealings
with
men
indeed
in
those
days
it
was
thought
poetic
and
imaginative
to
look
upon
life
as
a
thing
to
be
borne
rather
than
enjoyed
so
i
mused
till
dick
laugh
brought
me
back
into
the
oxfordshire
fields
one
thing
seems
strange
to
me
said
he
that
i
must
needs
trouble
myself
about
the
winter
and
its
scantiness
in
the
midst
of
the
summer
abundance
if
it
had
happened
to
me
before
i
should
have
thought
it
was
your
doing
guest
that
you
had
thrown
a
kind
of
evil
charm
over
me
now
you
know
said
he
suddenly
that
only
a
joke
so
you
must
take
it
to
heart
all
right
said
i
i
do
yet
i
did
feel
somewhat
uneasy
at
his
words
after
all
we
crossed
the
causeway
this
time
and
did
not
turn
back
to
the
house
but
went
along
a
path
beside
a
field
of
wheat
now
almost
ready
to
blossom
i
said
we
do
not
dine
in
the
house
or
garden
then
as
indeed
i
did
not
expect
to
do
where
do
we
meet
then
for
i
can
see
that
the
houses
are
mostly
very
small
yes
said
dick
you
are
right
they
are
small
in
this
there
are
so
many
good
old
houses
left
that
people
dwell
a
good
deal
in
such
small
detached
houses
as
to
our
dinner
we
are
going
to
have
our
feast
in
the
church
i
wish
for
your
sake
it
were
as
big
and
handsome
as
that
of
the
old
roman
town
to
the
west
or
the
forest
town
to
the
north
but
however
it
will
hold
us
all
and
though
it
is
a
little
thing
it
is
beautiful
in
its
way
this
was
somewhat
new
to
me
this
dinner
in
a
church
and
i
thought
of
the
of
the
middle
ages
but
i
said
nothing
and
presently
we
came
out
into
the
road
which
ran
through
the
village
dick
looked
up
and
down
it
and
seeing
only
two
straggling
groups
before
us
said
it
seems
as
if
we
must
be
somewhat
late
they
are
all
gone
on
and
they
will
be
sure
to
make
a
point
of
waiting
for
you
as
the
guest
of
guests
since
you
come
from
so
far
he
hastened
as
he
spoke
and
i
kept
up
with
him
and
presently
we
came
to
a
little
avenue
of
which
led
us
straight
to
the
church
porch
from
whose
open
door
came
the
sound
of
cheerful
voices
and
laughter
and
varied
merriment
yes
said
dick
it
the
coolest
place
for
one
thing
this
hot
evening
come
along
they
will
be
glad
to
see
you
indeed
in
spite
of
my
bath
i
felt
the
weather
more
sultry
and
oppressive
than
on
any
day
of
our
journey
yet
we
went
into
the
church
which
was
a
simple
little
building
with
one
little
aisle
divided
from
the
nave
by
three
round
arches
a
chancel
and
a
rather
roomy
transept
for
so
small
a
building
the
windows
mostly
of
the
graceful
oxfordshire
fourteenth
century
type
there
was
no
modern
architectural
decoration
in
it
it
looked
indeed
as
if
none
had
been
attempted
since
the
puritans
whitewashed
the
mediaeval
saints
and
histories
on
the
wall
it
was
however
gaily
dressed
up
for
this
day
festival
with
festoons
of
flowers
from
arch
to
arch
and
great
pitchers
of
flowers
standing
about
on
the
floor
while
under
the
west
window
hung
two
cross
scythes
their
blades
polished
white
and
gleaming
from
out
of
the
flowers
that
wreathed
them
but
its
best
ornament
was
the
crowd
of
handsome
men
and
women
that
were
set
down
to
table
and
who
with
their
bright
faces
and
rich
hair
over
their
gay
holiday
raiment
looked
as
the
persian
poet
puts
it
like
a
bed
of
tulips
in
the
sun
though
the
church
was
a
small
one
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
a
small
church
makes
a
biggish
house
and
on
this
evening
there
was
no
need
to
set
cross
tables
along
the
transepts
though
doubtless
these
would
be
wanted
next
day
when
the
learned
men
of
whom
dick
has
been
speaking
should
be
come
to
take
their
more
humble
part
in
the
haymaking
i
stood
on
the
threshold
with
the
expectant
smile
on
my
face
of
a
man
who
is
going
to
take
part
in
a
festivity
which
he
is
really
prepared
to
enjoy
dick
standing
by
me
was
looking
round
the
company
with
an
air
of
proprietorship
in
them
i
thought
opposite
me
sat
clara
and
ellen
with
dick
place
open
between
them
they
were
smiling
but
their
beautiful
faces
were
each
turned
towards
the
neighbours
on
either
side
who
were
talking
to
them
and
they
did
not
seem
to
see
me
i
turned
to
dick
expecting
him
to
lead
me
forward
and
he
turned
his
face
to
me
but
strange
to
say
though
it
was
as
smiling
and
cheerful
as
ever
it
made
no
response
to
my
glance
nay
he
seemed
to
take
no
heed
at
all
of
my
presence
and
i
noticed
that
none
of
the
company
looked
at
me
a
pang
shot
through
me
as
of
some
disaster
long
expected
and
suddenly
realised
dick
moved
on
a
little
without
a
word
to
me
i
was
not
three
yards
from
the
two
women
who
though
they
had
been
my
companions
for
such
a
short
time
had
really
as
i
thought
become
my
friends
clara
face
was
turned
full
upon
me
now
but
she
also
did
not
seem
to
see
me
though
i
know
i
was
trying
to
catch
her
eye
with
an
appealing
look
i
turned
to
ellen
and
she
seem
to
recognise
me
for
an
instant
but
her
bright
face
turned
sad
directly
and
she
shook
her
head
with
a
mournful
look
and
the
next
moment
all
consciousness
of
my
presence
had
faded
from
her
face
i
felt
lonely
and
sick
at
heart
past
the
power
of
words
to
describe
i
hung
about
a
minute
longer
and
then
turned
and
went
out
of
the
porch
again
and
through
the
into
the
road
while
the
blackbirds
sang
their
strongest
from
the
bushes
about
me
in
the
hot
june
evening
once
more
without
any
conscious
effort
of
will
i
set
my
face
toward
the
old
house
by
the
ford
but
as
i
turned
round
the
corner
which
led
to
the
remains
of
the
village
cross
i
came
upon
a
figure
strangely
contrasting
with
the
joyous
beautiful
people
i
had
left
behind
in
the
church
it
was
a
man
who
looked
old
but
whom
i
knew
from
habit
now
half
forgotten
was
really
not
much
more
than
fifty
his
face
was
rugged
and
grimed
rather
than
dirty
his
eyes
dull
and
bleared
his
body
bent
his
calves
thin
and
spindly
his
feet
dragging
and
limping
his
clothing
was
a
mixture
of
dirt
and
rags
long
to
me
as
i
passed
him
he
touched
his
hat
with
some
real
goodwill
and
courtesy
and
much
servility
inexpressibly
shocked
i
hurried
past
him
and
hastened
along
the
road
that
led
to
the
river
and
the
lower
end
of
the
village
but
suddenly
i
saw
as
it
were
a
black
cloud
rolling
along
to
meet
me
like
a
nightmare
of
my
childish
days
and
for
a
while
i
was
conscious
of
nothing
else
than
being
in
the
dark
and
whether
i
was
walking
or
sitting
or
lying
down
i
could
not
tell
i
lay
in
my
bed
in
my
house
at
dingy
hammersmith
thinking
about
it
all
and
trying
to
consider
if
i
was
overwhelmed
with
despair
at
finding
i
had
been
dreaming
a
dream
and
strange
to
say
i
found
that
i
was
not
so
despairing
or
indeed
it
a
dream
if
so
why
was
i
so
conscious
all
along
that
i
was
really
seeing
all
that
new
life
from
the
outside
still
wrapped
up
in
the
prejudices
the
anxieties
the
distrust
of
this
time
of
doubt
and
struggle
all
along
though
those
friends
were
so
real
to
me
i
had
been
feeling
as
if
i
had
no
business
amongst
them
as
though
the
time
would
come
when
they
would
reject
me
and
say
as
ellen
last
mournful
look
seemed
to
say
no
it
will
not
do
you
can
not
be
of
us
you
belong
so
entirely
to
the
unhappiness
of
the
past
that
our
happiness
even
would
weary
you
go
back
again
now
you
have
seen
us
and
your
outward
eyes
have
learned
that
in
spite
of
all
the
infallible
maxims
of
your
day
there
is
yet
a
time
of
rest
in
store
for
the
world
when
mastery
has
changed
into
fellowship
but
not
before
go
back
again
then
and
while
you
live
you
will
see
all
round
you
people
engaged
in
making
others
live
lives
which
are
not
their
own
while
they
themselves
care
nothing
for
their
own
real
lives
men
who
hate
life
though
they
fear
death
go
back
and
be
the
happier
for
having
seen
us
for
having
added
a
little
hope
to
your
struggle
go
on
living
while
you
may
striving
with
whatsoever
pain
and
labour
needs
must
be
to
build
up
little
by
little
the
new
day
of
fellowship
and
rest
and
happiness
yes
surely
and
if
others
can
see
it
as
i
have
seen
it
then
it
may
be
called
a
vision
rather
than
a
dream
footnotes
elegant
i
mean
as
a
persian
pattern
is
elegant
not
like
a
rich
elegant
lady
out
for
a
morning
call
i
should
rather
call
that
genteel
i
should
have
said
that
all
along
the
thames
there
were
abundance
of
mills
used
for
various
purposes
none
of
which
were
in
any
degree
unsightly
and
many
strikingly
beautiful
and
the
gardens
about
them
marvels
of
loveliness
