the
gambler

translated

i
at
length
i
returned
from
two
weeks
leave
of
absence
to
find
that
my
patrons
had
arrived
three
days
ago
in
roulettenberg
i
received
from
them
a
welcome
quite
different
to
that
which
i
had
expected
the
general
eyed
me
coldly
greeted
me
in
rather
haughty
fashion
and
dismissed
me
to
pay
my
respects
to
his
sister
it
was
clear
that
from
somewhere
money
had
been
acquired
i
thought
i
could
even
detect
a
certain
shamefacedness
in
the
general
glance
maria
philipovna
too
seemed
distraught
and
conversed
with
me
with
an
air
of
detachment
nevertheless
she
took
the
money
which
i
handed
to
her
counted
it
and
listened
to
what
i
had
to
tell
to
luncheon
there
were
expected
that
day
a
monsieur
mezentsov
a
french
lady
and
an
englishman
for
whenever
money
was
in
hand
a
banquet
in
muscovite
style
was
always
given
polina
alexandrovna
on
seeing
me
inquired
why
i
had
been
so
long
away
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
she
departed
evidently
this
was
not
mere
accident
and
i
felt
that
i
must
throw
some
light
upon
matters
it
was
high
time
that
i
did
so
i
was
assigned
a
small
room
on
the
fourth
floor
of
the
hotel
for
you
must
know
that
i
belonged
to
the
general
suite
so
far
as
i
could
see
the
party
had
already
gained
some
notoriety
in
the
place
which
had
come
to
look
upon
the
general
as
a
russian
nobleman
of
great
wealth
indeed
even
before
luncheon
he
charged
me
among
other
things
to
get
two
notes
changed
for
him
at
the
hotel
counter
which
put
us
in
a
position
to
be
thought
millionaires
at
all
events
for
a
week
later
i
was
about
to
take
mischa
and
nadia
for
a
walk
when
a
summons
reached
me
from
the
staircase
that
i
must
attend
the
general
he
began
by
deigning
to
inquire
of
me
where
i
was
going
to
take
the
children
and
as
he
did
so
i
could
see
that
he
failed
to
look
me
in
the
eyes
he
wanted
to
do
so
but
each
time
was
met
by
me
with
such
a
fixed
disrespectful
stare
that
he
desisted
in
confusion
in
pompous
language
however
which
jumbled
one
sentence
into
another
and
at
length
grew
disconnected
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
i
was
to
lead
the
children
altogether
away
from
the
casino
and
out
into
the
park
finally
his
anger
exploded
and
he
added
sharply
i
suppose
you
would
like
to
take
them
to
the
casino
to
play
roulette
well
excuse
my
speaking
so
plainly
but
i
know
how
addicted
you
are
to
gambling
though
i
am
not
your
mentor
nor
wish
to
be
at
least
i
have
a
right
to
require
that
you
shall
not
actually
compromise
me
i
have
no
money
for
gambling
i
quietly
replied
but
you
will
soon
be
in
receipt
of
some
retorted
the
general
reddening
a
little
as
he
dived
into
his
writing
desk
and
applied
himself
to
a
memorandum
book
from
it
he
saw
that
he
had
roubles
of
mine
in
his
keeping
let
us
calculate
he
went
on
we
must
translate
these
roubles
into
thalers
here
take
thalers
as
a
round
sum
the
rest
will
be
safe
in
my
hands
in
silence
i
took
the
money
you
must
not
be
offended
at
what
i
say
he
continued
you
are
too
touchy
about
these
things
what
i
have
said
i
have
said
merely
as
a
warning
to
do
so
is
no
more
than
my
right
when
returning
home
with
the
children
before
luncheon
i
met
a
cavalcade
of
our
party
riding
to
view
some
ruins
two
splendid
carriages
magnificently
horsed
with
mlle
blanche
maria
philipovna
and
polina
alexandrovna
in
one
of
them
and
the
frenchman
the
englishman
and
the
general
in
attendance
on
horseback
the
stopped
to
stare
at
them
for
the
effect
was
splendid
the
general
could
not
have
improved
upon
it
i
calculated
that
with
the
francs
which
i
had
brought
with
me
added
to
what
my
patrons
seemed
already
to
have
acquired
the
party
must
be
in
possession
of
at
least
or
francs
though
that
would
be
none
too
much
for
mlle
blanche
who
with
her
mother
and
the
frenchman
was
also
lodging
in
our
hotel
the
latter
gentleman
was
called
by
the
lacqueys
monsieur
le
comte
and
mlle
blanche
mother
was
dubbed
madame
la
comtesse
perhaps
in
very
truth
they
were
comte
et
comtesse
i
knew
that
monsieur
le
comte
would
take
no
notice
of
me
when
we
met
at
dinner
as
also
that
the
general
would
not
dream
of
introducing
us
nor
of
recommending
me
to
the
comte
however
the
latter
had
lived
awhile
in
russia
and
knew
that
the
person
referred
to
as
an
uchitel
is
never
looked
upon
as
a
bird
of
fine
feather
of
course
strictly
speaking
he
knew
me
but
i
was
an
uninvited
guest
at
the
luncheon
the
general
had
forgotten
to
arrange
otherwise
or
i
should
have
been
dispatched
to
dine
at
the
table
nevertheless
i
presented
myself
in
such
guise
that
the
general
looked
at
me
with
a
touch
of
approval
and
though
the
good
maria
philipovna
was
for
showing
me
my
place
the
fact
of
my
having
previously
met
the
englishman
astley
saved
me
and
thenceforward
i
figured
as
one
of
the
company
this
strange
englishman
i
had
met
first
in
prussia
where
we
had
happened
to
sit
in
a
railway
train
in
which
i
was
travelling
to
overtake
our
party
while
later
i
had
run
across
him
in
france
and
again
in
switzerland
twice
within
the
space
of
two
weeks
to
think
therefore
that
i
should
suddenly
encounter
him
again
here
in
roulettenberg
never
in
my
life
had
i
known
a
more
retiring
man
for
he
was
shy
to
the
pitch
of
imbecility
yet
well
aware
of
the
fact
for
he
was
no
fool
at
the
same
time
he
was
a
gentle
amiable
sort
of
an
individual
and
even
on
our
first
encounter
in
prussia
i
had
contrived
to
draw
him
out
and
he
had
told
me
that
he
had
just
been
to
the
north
cape
and
was
now
anxious
to
visit
the
fair
at
nizhni
novgorod
how
he
had
come
to
make
the
general
acquaintance
i
do
not
know
but
apparently
he
was
much
struck
with
polina
also
he
was
delighted
that
i
should
sit
next
him
at
table
for
he
appeared
to
look
upon
me
as
his
bosom
friend
during
the
meal
the
frenchman
was
in
great
feather
he
was
discursive
and
pompous
to
every
one
in
moscow
too
i
remembered
he
had
blown
a
great
many
bubbles
interminably
he
discoursed
on
finance
and
russian
politics
and
though
at
times
the
general
made
feints
to
contradict
him
he
did
so
humbly
and
as
though
wishing
not
wholly
to
lose
sight
of
his
own
dignity
for
myself
i
was
in
a
curious
frame
of
mind
even
before
luncheon
was
half
finished
i
had
asked
myself
the
old
eternal
question
why
do
i
continue
to
dance
attendance
upon
the
general
instead
of
having
left
him
and
his
family
long
ago
every
now
and
then
i
would
glance
at
polina
alexandrovna
but
she
paid
me
no
attention
until
eventually
i
became
so
irritated
that
i
decided
to
play
the
boor
first
of
all
i
suddenly
and
for
no
reason
whatever
plunged
loudly
and
gratuitously
into
the
general
conversation
above
everything
i
wanted
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
the
frenchman
and
with
that
end
in
view
i
turned
to
the
general
and
exclaimed
in
an
overbearing
sort
of
way
indeed
i
think
that
i
actually
interrupted
him
that
that
summer
it
had
been
almost
impossible
for
a
russian
to
dine
anywhere
at
tables
the
general
bent
upon
me
a
glance
of
astonishment
if
one
is
a
man
of
i
went
on
one
risks
abuse
by
so
doing
and
is
forced
to
put
up
with
insults
of
every
kind
both
at
paris
and
on
the
rhine
and
even
in
switzerland
there
are
so
many
poles
with
their
sympathisers
the
french
at
these
tables
that
one
can
not
get
a
word
in
edgeways
if
one
happens
only
to
be
a
russian
this
i
said
in
french
the
general
eyed
me
doubtfully
for
he
did
not
know
whether
to
be
angry
or
merely
to
feel
surprised
that
i
should
so
far
forget
myself
of
course
one
always
learns
something
everywhere
said
the
frenchman
in
a
careless
contemptuous
sort
of
tone
in
paris
too
i
had
a
dispute
with
a
pole
i
continued
and
then
with
a
french
officer
who
supported
him
after
that
a
section
of
the
frenchmen
present
took
my
part
they
did
so
as
soon
as
i
told
them
the
story
of
how
once
i
threatened
to
spit
into
monsignor
coffee
to
spit
into
it
the
general
inquired
with
grave
disapproval
in
his
tone
and
a
stare
of
astonishment
while
the
frenchman
looked
at
me
unbelievingly
just
so
i
replied
you
must
know
that
on
one
occasion
when
for
two
days
i
had
felt
certain
that
at
any
moment
i
might
have
to
depart
for
rome
on
business
i
repaired
to
the
embassy
of
the
holy
see
in
paris
to
have
my
passport
visaed
there
i
encountered
a
sacristan
of
about
fifty
and
a
man
dry
and
cold
of
mien
after
listening
politely
but
with
great
reserve
to
my
account
of
myself
this
sacristan
asked
me
to
wait
a
little
i
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
depart
but
of
course
i
sat
down
pulled
out
a
copy
of
nationale
and
fell
to
reading
an
extraordinary
piece
of
invective
against
russia
which
it
happened
to
contain
as
i
was
thus
engaged
i
heard
some
one
enter
an
adjoining
room
and
ask
for
monsignor
after
which
i
saw
the
sacristan
make
a
low
bow
to
the
visitor
and
then
another
bow
as
the
visitor
took
his
leave
i
ventured
to
remind
the
good
man
of
my
own
business
also
whereupon
with
an
expression
of
if
anything
increased
dryness
he
again
asked
me
to
wait
soon
a
third
visitor
arrived
who
like
myself
had
come
on
business
he
was
an
austrian
of
some
sort
and
as
soon
as
ever
he
had
stated
his
errand
he
was
conducted
upstairs
this
made
me
very
angry
i
rose
approached
the
sacristan
and
told
him
that
since
monsignor
was
receiving
callers
his
lordship
might
just
as
well
finish
off
my
affair
as
well
upon
this
the
sacristan
shrunk
back
in
astonishment
it
simply
passed
his
understanding
that
any
insignificant
russian
should
dare
to
compare
himself
with
other
visitors
of
monsignor
in
a
tone
of
the
utmost
effrontery
as
though
he
were
delighted
to
have
a
chance
of
insulting
me
he
looked
me
up
and
down
and
then
said
do
you
suppose
that
monsignor
is
going
to
put
aside
his
coffee
for
you
but
i
only
cried
the
louder
let
me
tell
you
that
i
am
going
to
spit
into
that
coffee
yes
and
if
you
do
not
get
me
my
passport
visaed
this
very
minute
i
shall
take
it
to
monsignor
myself
what
while
he
is
engaged
with
a
cardinal
screeched
the
sacristan
again
shrinking
back
in
horror
then
rushing
to
the
door
he
spread
out
his
arms
as
though
he
would
rather
die
than
let
me
enter
thereupon
i
declared
that
i
was
a
heretic
and
a
barbarian
je
suis
heretique
et
barbare
i
said
and
that
these
archbishops
and
cardinals
and
monsignors
and
the
rest
of
them
meant
nothing
at
all
to
me
in
a
word
i
showed
him
that
i
was
not
going
to
give
way
he
looked
at
me
with
an
air
of
infinite
resentment
then
he
snatched
up
my
passport
and
departed
with
it
upstairs
a
minute
later
the
passport
had
been
visaed
here
it
is
now
if
you
care
to
see
it
and
i
pulled
out
the
document
and
exhibited
the
roman
visa
but
the
general
began
what
really
saved
you
was
the
fact
that
you
proclaimed
yourself
a
heretic
and
a
barbarian
remarked
the
frenchman
with
a
smile
cela
pas
si
bete
but
is
that
how
russian
subjects
ought
to
be
treated
why
when
they
settle
here
they
dare
not
utter
even
a
word
they
are
ready
even
to
deny
the
fact
that
they
are
russians
at
all
events
at
my
hotel
in
paris
i
received
far
more
attention
from
the
company
after
i
had
told
them
about
the
fracas
with
the
sacristan
a
fat
polish
nobleman
who
had
been
the
most
offensive
of
all
who
were
present
at
the
table
at
once
went
upstairs
while
some
of
the
frenchmen
were
simply
disgusted
when
i
told
them
that
two
years
ago
i
had
encountered
a
man
at
whom
in
a
french
fired
for
the
mere
fun
of
discharging
his
musket
that
man
was
then
a
boy
of
ten
and
his
family
are
still
residing
in
moscow
impossible
the
frenchman
spluttered
no
french
soldier
would
fire
at
a
child
nevertheless
the
incident
was
as
i
say
i
replied
a
very
respected
told
me
the
story
and
i
myself
could
see
the
scar
left
on
his
cheek
the
frenchman
then
began
chattering
volubly
and
the
general
supported
him
but
i
recommended
the
former
to
read
for
example
extracts
from
the
memoirs
of
general
perovski
who
in
was
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
the
french
finally
maria
philipovna
said
something
to
interrupt
the
conversation
the
general
was
furious
with
me
for
having
started
the
altercation
with
the
frenchman
on
the
other
hand
astley
seemed
to
take
great
pleasure
in
my
brush
with
monsieur
and
rising
from
the
table
proposed
that
we
should
go
and
have
a
drink
together
the
same
afternoon
at
four
i
went
to
have
my
customary
talk
with
polina
alexandrovna
and
the
talk
soon
extended
to
a
stroll
we
entered
the
park
and
approached
the
casino
where
polina
seated
herself
upon
a
bench
near
the
fountain
and
sent
nadia
away
to
a
little
distance
to
play
with
some
other
children
mischa
also
i
dispatched
to
play
by
the
fountain
and
in
this
fashion
we
that
is
to
say
polina
and
myself
contrived
to
find
ourselves
alone
of
course
we
began
by
talking
on
business
matters
polina
seemed
furious
when
i
handed
her
only
gulden
for
she
had
thought
to
receive
from
paris
as
the
proceeds
of
the
pledging
of
her
diamonds
at
least
gulden
or
even
more
come
what
may
i
must
have
money
she
said
and
get
it
somehow
i
will
otherwise
i
shall
be
ruined
i
asked
her
what
had
happened
during
my
absence
nothing
except
that
two
pieces
of
news
have
reached
us
from
petersburg
in
the
first
place
my
grandmother
is
very
ill
and
unlikely
to
last
another
couple
of
days
we
had
this
from
timothy
petrovitch
himself
and
he
is
a
reliable
person
every
moment
we
are
expecting
to
receive
news
of
the
end
all
of
you
are
on
the
tiptoe
of
expectation
i
queried
of
course
all
of
us
and
every
minute
of
the
day
for
a
now
we
have
been
looking
for
this
looking
for
it
yes
looking
for
it
i
am
not
her
blood
relation
you
know
i
am
merely
the
general
yet
i
am
certain
that
the
old
lady
has
remembered
me
in
her
will
yes
i
believe
that
you
will
come
in
for
a
good
deal
i
said
with
some
assurance
yes
for
she
is
fond
of
me
but
how
come
you
to
think
so
i
answered
this
question
with
another
one
that
marquis
of
yours
i
said
is
he
also
familiar
with
your
family
secrets
and
why
are
you
yourself
so
interested
in
them
was
her
retort
as
she
eyed
me
with
dry
grimness
never
mind
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
general
has
succeeded
in
borrowing
money
of
the
marquis
it
may
be
so
is
it
likely
that
the
marquis
would
have
lent
the
money
if
he
had
not
known
something
or
other
about
your
grandmother
did
you
notice
too
that
three
times
during
luncheon
when
speaking
of
her
he
called
her
baboulenka
dear
little
grandmother
what
loving
friendly
behaviour
to
be
sure
yes
that
is
true
as
soon
as
ever
he
learnt
that
i
was
likely
to
inherit
something
from
her
he
began
to
pay
me
his
addresses
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
that
then
he
has
only
just
begun
his
courting
why
i
thought
he
had
been
doing
so
a
long
while
you
know
he
has
not
retorted
polina
angrily
but
where
on
earth
did
you
pick
up
this
englishman
she
said
this
after
a
pause
i
knew
you
would
ask
about
him
whereupon
i
told
her
of
my
previous
encounters
with
astley
while
travelling
he
is
very
shy
i
said
and
susceptible
also
he
is
in
love
with
yes
he
is
in
love
with
me
she
replied
and
he
is
ten
times
richer
than
the
frenchman
in
fact
what
does
the
frenchman
possess
to
me
it
seems
at
least
doubtful
that
he
possesses
anything
at
all
oh
no
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
he
does
possess
some
chateau
or
other
last
night
the
general
told
me
that
for
certain
now
are
you
satisfied
nevertheless
in
your
place
i
should
marry
the
englishman
and
why
asked
polina
because
though
the
frenchman
is
the
handsomer
of
the
two
he
is
also
the
baser
whereas
the
englishman
is
not
only
a
man
of
honour
but
ten
times
the
wealthier
of
the
pair
yes
but
then
the
frenchman
is
a
marquis
and
the
cleverer
of
the
two
remarked
polina
imperturbably
is
that
so
i
repeated
yes
absolutely
polina
was
not
at
all
pleased
at
my
questions
i
could
see
that
she
was
doing
her
best
to
irritate
me
with
the
brusquerie
of
her
answers
but
i
took
no
notice
of
this
it
amuses
me
to
see
you
grow
angry
she
continued
however
inasmuch
as
i
allow
you
to
indulge
in
these
questions
and
conjectures
you
ought
to
pay
me
something
for
the
privilege
i
consider
that
i
have
a
perfect
right
to
put
these
questions
to
you
was
my
calm
retort
for
the
reason
that
i
am
ready
to
pay
for
them
and
also
care
little
what
becomes
of
me
polina
giggled
last
time
you
told
me
when
on
the
shlangenberg
that
at
a
word
from
me
you
would
be
ready
to
jump
down
a
thousand
feet
into
the
abyss
some
day
i
may
remind
you
of
that
saying
in
order
to
see
if
you
will
be
as
good
as
your
word
yes
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
i
shall
do
so
i
hate
you
because
i
have
allowed
you
to
go
to
such
lengths
and
i
also
hate
you
and
still
more
because
you
are
so
necessary
to
me
for
the
time
being
i
want
you
so
i
must
keep
you
then
she
made
a
movement
to
rise
her
tone
had
sounded
very
angry
indeed
of
late
her
talks
with
me
had
invariably
ended
on
a
note
of
temper
and
irritation
yes
of
real
temper
may
i
ask
you
who
is
this
mlle
blanche
i
inquired
since
i
did
not
wish
polina
to
depart
without
an
explanation
you
know
who
she
is
just
mlle
blanche
nothing
further
has
transpired
probably
she
will
soon
be
madame
general
that
is
to
say
if
the
rumours
that
grandmamma
is
nearing
her
end
should
prove
true
mlle
blanche
with
her
mother
and
her
cousin
the
marquis
know
very
well
that
as
things
now
stand
we
are
ruined
and
is
the
general
at
last
in
love
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
listen
to
me
take
these
florins
and
go
and
play
roulette
with
them
win
as
much
for
me
as
you
can
for
i
am
badly
in
need
of
money
so
saying
she
called
nadia
back
to
her
side
and
entered
the
casino
where
she
joined
the
rest
of
our
party
for
myself
i
took
in
musing
astonishment
the
first
path
to
the
left
something
had
seemed
to
strike
my
brain
when
she
told
me
to
go
and
play
roulette
strangely
enough
that
something
had
also
seemed
to
make
me
hesitate
and
to
set
me
analysing
my
feelings
with
regard
to
her
in
fact
during
the
two
weeks
of
my
absence
i
had
felt
far
more
at
my
ease
than
i
did
now
on
the
day
of
my
return
although
while
travelling
i
had
moped
like
an
imbecile
rushed
about
like
a
man
in
a
fever
and
actually
beheld
her
in
my
dreams
indeed
on
one
occasion
this
happened
in
switzerland
when
i
was
asleep
in
the
train
i
had
spoken
aloud
to
her
and
set
all
my
laughing
again
therefore
i
put
to
myself
the
question
do
i
or
do
i
not
love
her
and
again
i
could
return
myself
no
answer
or
rather
for
the
hundredth
time
i
told
myself
that
i
detested
her
yes
i
detested
her
there
were
moments
more
especially
at
the
close
of
our
talks
together
when
i
would
gladly
have
given
half
my
life
to
have
strangled
her
i
swear
that
had
there
at
such
moments
been
a
sharp
knife
ready
to
my
hand
i
would
have
seized
that
knife
with
pleasure
and
plunged
it
into
her
breast
yet
i
also
swear
that
if
on
the
shlangenberg
she
had
really
said
to
me
leap
into
that
abyss
i
should
have
leapt
into
it
and
with
equal
pleasure
yes
this
i
knew
well
one
way
or
the
other
the
thing
must
soon
be
ended
she
too
knew
it
in
some
curious
way
the
thought
that
i
was
fully
conscious
of
her
inaccessibility
and
of
the
impossibility
of
my
ever
realising
my
dreams
afforded
her
i
am
certain
the
keenest
possible
pleasure
otherwise
is
it
likely
that
she
the
cautious
and
clever
woman
that
she
was
would
have
indulged
in
this
familiarity
and
openness
with
me
hitherto
i
concluded
she
had
looked
upon
me
in
the
same
light
that
the
old
empress
did
upon
her
servant
the
empress
who
hesitated
not
to
unrobe
herself
before
her
slave
since
she
did
not
account
a
slave
a
man
yes
often
polina
must
have
taken
me
for
something
less
than
a
man
still
she
had
charged
me
with
a
commission
to
win
what
i
could
at
roulette
yet
all
the
time
i
could
not
help
wondering
why
it
was
so
necessary
for
her
to
win
something
and
what
new
schemes
could
have
sprung
to
birth
in
her
brain
a
host
of
new
and
unknown
factors
seemed
to
have
arisen
during
the
last
two
weeks
well
it
behoved
me
to
divine
them
and
to
probe
them
and
that
as
soon
as
possible
yet
not
now
at
the
present
moment
i
must
repair
to
the
ii
i
confess
i
did
not
like
it
although
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
play
i
felt
averse
to
doing
so
on
behalf
of
some
one
else
in
fact
it
almost
upset
my
balance
and
i
entered
the
gaming
rooms
with
an
angry
feeling
at
my
heart
at
first
glance
the
scene
irritated
me
never
at
any
time
have
i
been
able
to
bear
the
flunkeyishness
which
one
meets
in
the
press
of
the
world
at
large
but
more
especially
in
that
of
russia
where
almost
every
evening
journalists
write
on
two
subjects
in
particular
namely
on
the
splendour
and
luxury
of
the
casinos
to
be
found
in
the
rhenish
towns
and
on
the
heaps
of
gold
which
are
daily
to
be
seen
lying
on
their
tables
those
journalists
are
not
paid
for
doing
so
they
write
thus
merely
out
of
a
spirit
of
disinterested
complaisance
for
there
is
nothing
splendid
about
the
establishments
in
question
and
not
only
are
there
no
heaps
of
gold
to
be
seen
lying
on
their
tables
but
also
there
is
very
little
money
to
be
seen
at
all
of
course
during
the
season
some
madman
or
another
may
make
his
appearance
generally
an
englishman
or
an
asiatic
or
a
turk
and
as
had
happened
during
the
summer
of
which
i
write
win
or
lose
a
great
deal
but
as
regards
the
rest
of
the
crowd
it
plays
only
for
petty
gulden
and
seldom
does
much
wealth
figure
on
the
board
when
on
the
present
occasion
i
entered
the
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
it
was
several
moments
before
i
could
even
make
up
my
mind
to
play
for
one
thing
the
crowd
oppressed
me
had
i
been
playing
for
myself
i
think
i
should
have
left
at
once
and
never
have
embarked
upon
gambling
at
all
for
i
could
feel
my
heart
beginning
to
beat
and
my
heart
was
anything
but
also
i
knew
i
had
long
ago
made
up
my
mind
that
never
should
i
depart
from
roulettenberg
until
some
radical
some
final
change
had
taken
place
in
my
fortunes
thus
it
must
and
would
be
however
ridiculous
it
may
seem
to
you
that
i
was
expecting
to
win
at
roulette
i
look
upon
the
generally
accepted
opinion
concerning
the
folly
and
the
grossness
of
hoping
to
win
at
gambling
as
a
thing
even
more
absurd
for
why
is
gambling
a
whit
worse
than
any
other
method
of
acquiring
money
how
for
instance
is
it
worse
than
trade
true
out
of
a
hundred
persons
only
one
can
win
yet
what
business
is
that
of
yours
or
of
mine
at
all
events
i
confined
myself
at
first
simply
to
looking
on
and
decided
to
attempt
nothing
serious
indeed
i
felt
that
if
i
began
to
do
anything
at
all
i
should
do
it
in
an
haphazard
sort
of
way
of
that
i
felt
certain
also
it
behoved
me
to
learn
the
game
itself
since
despite
a
thousand
descriptions
of
roulette
which
i
had
read
with
ceaseless
avidity
i
knew
nothing
of
its
rules
and
had
never
even
seen
it
played
in
the
first
place
everything
about
it
seemed
to
me
so
foul
so
morally
mean
and
foul
yet
i
am
not
speaking
of
the
hungry
restless
folk
who
by
scores
nay
even
by
hundreds
could
be
seen
crowded
around
the
for
in
a
desire
to
win
quickly
and
to
win
much
i
can
see
nothing
sordid
i
have
always
applauded
the
opinion
of
a
certain
dead
and
gone
but
cocksure
moralist
who
replied
to
the
excuse
that
one
may
always
gamble
moderately
by
saying
that
to
do
so
makes
things
worse
since
in
that
case
the
profits
too
will
always
be
moderate
insignificant
profits
and
sumptuous
profits
do
not
stand
on
the
same
footing
no
it
is
all
a
matter
of
proportion
what
may
seem
a
small
sum
to
a
rothschild
may
seem
a
large
sum
to
me
and
it
is
not
the
fault
of
stakes
or
of
winnings
that
everywhere
men
can
be
found
winning
can
be
found
depriving
their
fellows
of
something
just
as
they
do
at
roulette
as
to
the
question
whether
stakes
and
winnings
are
in
themselves
immoral
is
another
question
altogether
and
i
wish
to
express
no
opinion
upon
it
yet
the
very
fact
that
i
was
full
of
a
strong
desire
to
win
caused
this
gambling
for
gain
in
spite
of
its
attendant
squalor
to
contain
if
you
will
something
intimate
something
sympathetic
to
my
eyes
for
it
is
always
pleasant
to
see
men
dispensing
with
ceremony
and
acting
naturally
and
in
an
unbuttoned
mood
yet
why
should
i
so
deceive
myself
i
could
see
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
vain
and
unreasoning
pursuit
and
what
at
the
first
glance
seemed
to
me
the
ugliest
feature
in
this
mob
of
roulette
players
was
their
respect
for
their
occupation
the
seriousness
and
even
the
humility
with
which
they
stood
around
the
gaming
tables
moreover
i
had
always
drawn
sharp
distinctions
between
a
game
which
is
de
mauvais
genre
and
a
game
which
is
permissible
to
a
decent
man
in
fact
there
are
two
sorts
of
gaming
namely
the
game
of
the
gentleman
and
the
game
of
the
plebs
the
game
for
gain
and
the
game
of
the
herd
herein
as
said
i
draw
sharp
distinctions
yet
how
essentially
base
are
the
distinctions
for
instance
a
gentleman
may
stake
say
five
or
ten
louis
seldom
more
unless
he
is
a
very
rich
man
when
he
may
stake
say
a
thousand
francs
but
he
must
do
this
simply
for
the
love
of
the
game
itself
simply
for
sport
simply
in
order
to
observe
the
process
of
winning
or
of
losing
and
above
all
things
as
a
man
who
remains
quite
uninterested
in
the
possibility
of
his
issuing
a
winner
if
he
wins
he
will
be
at
liberty
perhaps
to
give
vent
to
a
laugh
or
to
pass
a
remark
on
the
circumstance
to
a
bystander
or
to
stake
again
or
to
double
his
stake
but
even
this
he
must
do
solely
out
of
curiosity
and
for
the
pleasure
of
watching
the
play
of
chances
and
of
calculations
and
not
because
of
any
vulgar
desire
to
win
in
a
word
he
must
look
upon
the
upon
roulette
and
upon
trente
et
quarante
as
mere
relaxations
which
have
been
arranged
solely
for
his
amusement
of
the
existence
of
the
lures
and
gains
upon
which
the
bank
is
founded
and
maintained
he
must
profess
to
have
not
an
inkling
best
of
all
he
ought
to
imagine
his
and
the
rest
of
the
mob
which
stands
trembling
over
a
coin
to
be
equally
rich
and
gentlemanly
with
himself
and
playing
solely
for
recreation
and
pleasure
this
complete
ignorance
of
the
realities
this
innocent
view
of
mankind
is
what
in
my
opinion
constitutes
the
truly
aristocratic
for
instance
i
have
seen
even
fond
mothers
so
far
indulge
their
guileless
elegant
daughters
misses
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
as
to
give
them
a
few
gold
coins
and
teach
them
how
to
play
and
though
the
young
ladies
may
have
won
or
have
lost
they
have
invariably
laughed
and
departed
as
though
they
were
well
pleased
in
the
same
way
i
saw
our
general
once
approach
the
table
in
a
stolid
important
manner
a
lacquey
darted
to
offer
him
a
chair
but
the
general
did
not
even
notice
him
slowly
he
took
out
his
money
bags
and
slowly
extracted
francs
in
gold
which
he
staked
on
the
black
and
won
yet
he
did
not
take
up
his
winnings
he
left
them
there
on
the
table
again
the
black
turned
up
and
again
he
did
not
gather
in
what
he
had
won
and
when
in
the
third
round
the
red
turned
up
he
lost
at
a
stroke
francs
yet
even
then
he
rose
with
a
smile
and
thus
preserved
his
reputation
yet
i
knew
that
his
money
bags
must
be
chafing
his
heart
as
well
as
that
had
the
stake
been
twice
or
thrice
as
much
again
he
would
still
have
restrained
himself
from
venting
his
disappointment
on
the
other
hand
i
saw
a
frenchman
first
win
and
then
lose
francs
cheerfully
and
without
a
murmur
yes
even
if
a
gentleman
should
lose
his
whole
substance
he
must
never
give
way
to
annoyance
money
must
be
so
subservient
to
gentility
as
never
to
be
worth
a
thought
of
course
the
supremely
aristocratic
thing
is
to
be
entirely
oblivious
of
the
mire
of
rabble
with
its
setting
but
sometimes
a
reverse
course
may
be
aristocratic
to
remark
to
scan
and
even
to
gape
at
the
mob
for
preference
through
a
lorgnette
even
as
though
one
were
taking
the
crowd
and
its
squalor
for
a
sort
of
raree
show
which
had
been
organised
specially
for
a
gentleman
diversion
though
one
may
be
squeezed
by
the
crowd
one
must
look
as
though
one
were
fully
assured
of
being
the
observer
of
having
neither
part
nor
lot
with
the
observed
at
the
same
time
to
stare
fixedly
about
one
is
unbecoming
for
that
again
is
ungentlemanly
seeing
that
no
spectacle
is
worth
an
open
stare
are
no
spectacles
in
the
world
which
merit
from
a
gentleman
too
pronounced
an
inspection
however
to
me
personally
the
scene
did
seem
to
be
worth
undisguised
contemplation
more
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
had
come
there
not
only
to
look
at
but
also
to
number
myself
sincerely
and
wholeheartedly
with
the
mob
as
for
my
secret
moral
views
i
had
no
room
for
them
amongst
my
actual
practical
opinions
let
that
stand
as
written
i
am
writing
only
to
relieve
my
conscience
yet
let
me
say
also
this
that
from
the
first
i
have
been
consistent
in
having
an
intense
aversion
to
any
trial
of
my
acts
and
thoughts
by
a
moral
standard
another
standard
altogether
has
directed
my
life
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
mob
was
playing
in
exceedingly
foul
fashion
indeed
i
have
an
idea
that
sheer
robbery
was
going
on
around
that
the
croupiers
who
sat
at
the
two
ends
of
it
had
not
only
to
watch
the
stakes
but
also
to
calculate
the
game
an
immense
amount
of
work
for
two
men
as
for
the
crowd
itself
well
it
consisted
mostly
of
frenchmen
yet
i
was
not
then
taking
notes
merely
in
order
to
be
able
to
give
you
a
description
of
roulette
but
in
order
to
get
my
bearings
as
to
my
behaviour
when
i
myself
should
begin
to
play
for
example
i
noticed
that
nothing
was
more
common
than
for
another
hand
to
stretch
out
and
grab
one
winnings
whenever
one
had
won
then
there
would
arise
a
dispute
and
frequently
an
uproar
and
it
would
be
a
case
of
i
beg
of
you
to
prove
and
to
produce
witnesses
to
the
fact
that
the
stake
is
yours
at
first
the
proceedings
were
pure
greek
to
me
i
could
only
divine
and
distinguish
that
stakes
were
hazarded
on
numbers
on
odd
or
even
and
on
colours
polina
money
i
decided
to
risk
that
evening
only
to
the
amount
of
gulden
the
thought
that
i
was
not
going
to
play
for
myself
quite
unnerved
me
it
was
an
unpleasant
sensation
and
i
tried
hard
to
banish
it
i
had
a
feeling
that
once
i
had
begun
to
play
for
polina
i
should
wreck
my
own
fortunes
also
i
wonder
if
any
one
has
ever
approached
a
without
falling
an
immediate
prey
to
superstition
i
began
by
pulling
out
fifty
gulden
and
staking
them
on
even
the
wheel
spun
and
stopped
at
i
had
lost
with
a
feeling
like
a
sick
qualm
as
though
i
would
like
to
make
my
way
out
of
the
crowd
and
go
home
i
staked
another
fifty
gulden
this
time
on
the
red
the
red
turned
up
next
time
i
staked
the
gulden
just
where
they
lay
and
again
the
red
turned
up
again
i
staked
the
whole
sum
and
again
the
red
turned
up
clutching
my
gulden
i
placed
of
them
on
twelve
figures
to
see
what
would
come
of
it
the
result
was
that
the
croupier
paid
me
out
three
times
my
total
stake
thus
from
gulden
my
store
had
grown
to
upon
that
such
a
curious
such
an
inexplicable
unwonted
feeling
overcame
me
that
i
decided
to
depart
always
the
thought
kept
recurring
to
me
that
if
i
had
been
playing
for
myself
alone
i
should
never
have
had
such
luck
once
more
i
staked
the
whole
gulden
on
the
even
the
wheel
stopped
at
i
was
paid
out
another
gulden
and
snatching
up
my
pile
of
departed
in
search
of
polina
alexandrovna
i
found
the
whole
party
walking
in
the
park
and
was
able
to
get
an
interview
with
her
only
after
supper
this
time
the
frenchman
was
absent
from
the
meal
and
the
general
seemed
to
be
in
a
more
expansive
vein
among
other
things
he
thought
it
necessary
to
remind
me
that
he
would
be
sorry
to
see
me
playing
at
the
in
his
opinion
such
conduct
would
greatly
compromise
him
especially
if
i
were
to
lose
much
and
even
if
you
were
to
win
much
i
should
be
compromised
he
added
in
a
meaning
sort
of
way
of
course
i
have
no
right
to
order
your
actions
but
you
yourself
will
agree
that
as
usual
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
i
answered
drily
that
i
had
very
little
money
in
my
possession
and
that
consequently
i
was
hardly
in
a
position
to
indulge
in
any
conspicuous
play
even
if
i
did
gamble
at
last
when
ascending
to
my
own
room
i
succeeded
in
handing
polina
her
winnings
and
told
her
that
next
time
i
should
not
play
for
her
why
not
she
asked
excitedly
because
i
wish
to
play
for
myself
i
replied
with
a
feigned
glance
of
astonishment
that
is
my
sole
reason
then
are
you
so
certain
that
your
will
get
us
out
of
our
difficulties
she
inquired
with
a
quizzical
smile
i
said
very
seriously
yes
and
then
added
possibly
my
certainty
about
winning
may
seem
to
you
ridiculous
yet
pray
leave
me
in
peace
nonetheless
she
insisted
that
i
ought
to
go
halves
with
her
in
the
day
winnings
and
offered
me
gulden
on
condition
that
henceforth
i
gambled
only
on
those
terms
but
i
refused
to
do
so
once
and
for
all
stating
as
my
reason
that
i
found
myself
unable
to
play
on
behalf
of
any
one
else
i
am
not
unwilling
so
to
do
i
added
but
in
all
probability
i
should
lose
well
absurd
though
it
be
i
place
great
hopes
on
your
playing
of
roulette
she
remarked
musingly
wherefore
you
ought
to
play
as
my
partner
and
on
equal
shares
wherefore
of
course
you
will
do
as
i
wish
then
she
left
me
without
listening
to
any
further
protests
on
my
part
iii
on
the
morrow
she
said
not
a
word
to
me
about
gambling
in
fact
she
purposely
avoided
me
although
her
old
manner
to
me
had
not
changed
the
same
serene
coolness
was
hers
on
meeting
me
a
coolness
that
was
mingled
even
with
a
spice
of
contempt
and
dislike
in
short
she
was
at
no
pains
to
conceal
her
aversion
to
me
that
i
could
see
plainly
also
she
did
not
trouble
to
conceal
from
me
the
fact
that
i
was
necessary
to
her
and
that
she
was
keeping
me
for
some
end
which
she
had
in
view
consequently
there
became
established
between
us
relations
which
to
a
large
extent
were
incomprehensible
to
me
considering
her
general
pride
and
aloofness
for
example
although
she
knew
that
i
was
madly
in
love
with
her
she
allowed
me
to
speak
to
her
of
my
passion
though
she
could
not
well
have
showed
her
contempt
for
me
more
than
by
permitting
me
unhindered
and
unrebuked
to
mention
to
her
my
love
you
see
her
attitude
expressed
how
little
i
regard
your
feelings
as
well
as
how
little
i
care
for
what
you
say
to
me
or
for
what
you
feel
for
me
likewise
though
she
spoke
as
before
concerning
her
affairs
it
was
never
with
complete
frankness
in
her
contempt
for
me
there
were
refinements
although
she
knew
well
that
i
was
aware
of
a
certain
circumstance
in
her
life
of
something
which
might
one
day
cause
her
trouble
she
would
speak
to
me
about
her
affairs
whenever
she
had
need
of
me
for
a
given
end
as
though
i
were
a
slave
or
a
passing
acquaintance
yet
tell
them
me
only
in
so
far
as
one
would
need
to
know
them
if
one
were
going
to
be
made
temporary
use
of
had
i
not
known
the
whole
chain
of
events
or
had
she
not
seen
how
much
i
was
pained
and
disturbed
by
her
teasing
insistency
she
would
never
have
thought
it
worthwhile
to
soothe
me
with
this
frankness
even
though
since
she
not
infrequently
used
me
to
execute
commissions
that
were
not
only
troublesome
but
risky
she
ought
in
my
opinion
to
have
been
frank
in
any
case
but
forsooth
it
was
not
worth
her
while
to
trouble
about
my
feelings
about
the
fact
that
i
was
uneasy
and
perhaps
thrice
as
put
about
by
her
cares
and
misfortunes
as
she
was
herself
for
three
weeks
i
had
known
of
her
intention
to
take
to
roulette
she
had
even
warned
me
that
she
would
like
me
to
play
on
her
behalf
since
it
was
unbecoming
for
her
to
play
in
person
and
from
the
tone
of
her
words
i
had
gathered
that
there
was
something
on
her
mind
besides
a
mere
desire
to
win
money
as
if
money
could
matter
to
her
no
she
had
some
end
in
view
and
there
were
circumstances
at
which
i
could
guess
but
which
i
did
not
know
for
certain
true
the
slavery
and
abasement
in
which
she
held
me
might
have
given
me
such
things
often
do
so
the
power
to
question
her
with
abrupt
directness
seeing
that
inasmuch
as
i
figured
in
her
eyes
as
a
mere
slave
and
nonentity
she
could
not
very
well
have
taken
offence
at
any
rude
curiosity
but
the
fact
was
that
though
she
let
me
question
her
she
never
returned
me
a
single
answer
and
at
times
did
not
so
much
as
notice
me
that
is
how
matters
stood
next
day
there
was
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
a
telegram
which
four
days
ago
had
been
sent
to
petersburg
but
to
which
there
had
come
no
answer
the
general
was
visibly
disturbed
and
moody
for
the
matter
concerned
his
mother
the
frenchman
too
was
excited
and
after
dinner
the
whole
party
talked
long
and
seriously
together
the
tone
being
extraordinarily
presumptuous
and
offhand
to
everybody
it
almost
reminded
one
of
the
proverb
invite
a
man
to
your
table
and
soon
he
will
place
his
feet
upon
it
even
to
polina
he
was
brusque
almost
to
the
point
of
rudeness
yet
still
he
seemed
glad
to
join
us
in
our
walks
in
the
casino
or
in
our
rides
and
drives
about
the
town
i
had
long
been
aware
of
certain
circumstances
which
bound
the
general
to
him
i
had
long
been
aware
that
in
russia
they
had
hatched
some
scheme
together
although
i
did
not
know
whether
the
plot
had
come
to
anything
or
whether
it
was
still
only
in
the
stage
of
being
talked
of
likewise
i
was
aware
in
part
of
a
family
secret
namely
that
last
year
the
frenchman
had
bailed
the
general
out
of
debt
and
given
him
roubles
wherewith
to
pay
his
treasury
dues
on
retiring
from
the
service
and
now
of
course
the
general
was
in
a
vice
although
the
chief
part
in
the
affair
was
being
played
by
mlle
blanche
yes
of
this
last
i
had
no
doubt
but
who
was
this
mlle
blanche
it
was
said
of
her
that
she
was
a
frenchwoman
of
good
birth
who
living
with
her
mother
possessed
a
colossal
fortune
it
was
also
said
that
she
was
some
relation
to
the
marquis
but
only
a
distant
one
a
cousin
or
or
something
of
the
sort
likewise
i
knew
that
up
to
the
time
of
my
journey
to
paris
she
and
the
frenchman
had
been
more
ceremonious
towards
our
party
they
had
stood
on
a
much
more
precise
and
delicate
footing
with
them
but
that
now
their
acquaintanceship
their
friendship
their
intimacy
had
taken
on
a
much
more
and
air
perhaps
they
thought
that
our
means
were
too
modest
for
them
and
therefore
unworthy
of
politeness
or
reticence
also
for
the
last
three
days
i
had
noticed
certain
looks
which
astley
had
kept
throwing
at
mlle
blanche
and
her
mother
and
it
had
occurred
to
me
that
he
must
have
had
some
previous
acquaintance
with
the
pair
i
had
even
surmised
that
the
frenchman
too
must
have
met
astley
before
astley
was
a
man
so
shy
reserved
and
taciturn
in
his
manner
that
one
might
have
looked
for
anything
from
him
at
all
events
the
frenchman
accorded
him
only
the
slightest
of
greetings
and
scarcely
even
looked
at
him
certainly
he
did
not
seem
to
be
afraid
of
him
which
was
intelligible
enough
but
why
did
mlle
blanche
also
never
look
at
the
englishman
particularly
since
a
propos
of
something
or
another
the
marquis
had
declared
the
englishman
to
be
immensely
and
indubitably
rich
was
not
that
a
sufficient
reason
to
make
mlle
blanche
look
at
the
englishman
anyway
the
general
seemed
extremely
uneasy
and
one
could
well
understand
what
a
telegram
to
announce
the
death
of
his
mother
would
mean
for
him
although
i
thought
it
probable
that
polina
was
avoiding
me
for
a
definite
reason
i
adopted
a
cold
and
indifferent
air
for
i
felt
pretty
certain
that
it
would
not
be
long
before
she
herself
approached
me
for
two
days
therefore
i
devoted
my
attention
to
mlle
blanche
the
poor
general
was
in
despair
to
fall
in
love
at
and
with
such
vehemence
is
indeed
a
misfortune
and
add
to
that
his
widowerhood
his
children
his
ruined
property
his
debts
and
the
woman
with
whom
he
had
fallen
in
love
though
mlle
blanche
was
extremely
i
may
or
may
not
be
understood
when
i
say
that
she
had
one
of
those
faces
which
one
is
afraid
of
at
all
events
i
myself
have
always
feared
such
women
apparently
about
years
of
age
she
was
tall
and
with
shoulders
that
sloped
yet
though
her
neck
and
bosom
were
ample
in
their
proportions
her
skin
was
dull
yellow
in
colour
while
her
hair
which
was
extremely
abundant
sufficient
to
make
two
coiffures
was
as
black
as
indian
ink
add
to
that
a
pair
of
black
eyes
with
yellowish
whites
a
proud
glance
gleaming
teeth
and
lips
which
were
perennially
pomaded
and
redolent
of
musk
as
for
her
dress
it
was
invariably
rich
effective
and
chic
yet
in
good
taste
lastly
her
feet
and
hands
were
astonishing
and
her
voice
a
deep
contralto
sometimes
when
she
laughed
she
displayed
her
teeth
but
at
ordinary
times
her
air
was
taciturn
and
haughty
especially
in
the
presence
of
polina
and
maria
philipovna
yet
she
seemed
to
me
almost
destitute
of
education
and
even
of
wits
though
cunning
and
suspicious
this
apparently
was
not
because
her
life
had
been
lacking
in
incident
perhaps
if
all
were
known
the
marquis
was
not
her
kinsman
at
all
nor
her
mother
her
mother
but
there
was
evidence
that
in
berlin
where
we
had
first
come
across
the
pair
they
had
possessed
acquaintances
of
good
standing
as
for
the
marquis
himself
i
doubt
to
this
day
if
he
was
a
marquis
although
about
the
fact
that
he
had
formerly
belonged
to
high
society
for
instance
in
moscow
and
germany
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
what
he
had
formerly
been
in
france
i
had
not
a
notion
all
i
knew
was
that
he
was
said
to
possess
a
chateau
during
the
last
two
weeks
i
had
looked
for
much
to
transpire
but
am
still
ignorant
whether
at
that
time
anything
decisive
ever
passed
between
mademoiselle
and
the
general
everything
seemed
to
depend
upon
our
means
upon
whether
the
general
would
be
able
to
flourish
sufficient
money
in
her
face
if
ever
the
news
should
arrive
that
the
grandmother
was
not
dead
mlle
blanche
i
felt
sure
would
disappear
in
a
twinkling
indeed
it
surprised
and
amused
me
to
observe
what
a
passion
for
intrigue
i
was
developing
but
how
i
loathed
it
all
with
what
pleasure
would
i
have
given
everybody
and
everything
the
only
i
could
not
leave
polina
how
then
could
i
show
contempt
for
those
who
surrounded
her
espionage
is
a
base
thing
but
what
have
i
to
do
with
that
astley
too
i
found
a
curious
person
i
was
only
sure
that
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
polina
a
remarkable
and
diverting
circumstance
is
the
amount
which
may
lie
in
the
mien
of
a
shy
and
painfully
modest
man
who
has
been
touched
with
the
divine
passion
especially
when
he
would
rather
sink
into
the
earth
than
betray
himself
by
a
single
word
or
look
though
astley
frequently
met
us
when
we
were
out
walking
he
would
merely
take
off
his
hat
and
pass
us
by
though
i
knew
he
was
dying
to
join
us
even
when
invited
to
do
so
he
would
refuse
again
in
places
of
amusement
in
the
casino
at
concerts
or
near
the
fountain
he
was
never
far
from
the
spot
where
we
were
sitting
in
fact
wherever
we
were
in
the
park
in
the
forest
or
on
the
shlangenberg
one
needed
but
to
raise
one
eyes
and
glance
around
to
catch
sight
of
at
least
a
portion
of
astley
frame
sticking
out
whether
on
an
adjacent
path
or
behind
a
bush
yet
never
did
he
lose
any
chance
of
speaking
to
myself
and
one
morning
when
we
had
met
and
exchanged
a
couple
of
words
he
burst
out
in
his
usual
abrupt
way
without
saying
that
mlle
blanche
he
said
well
i
have
seen
a
good
many
women
like
her
after
that
he
was
silent
as
he
looked
me
meaningly
in
the
face
what
he
meant
i
did
not
know
but
to
my
glance
of
inquiry
he
returned
only
a
dry
nod
and
a
reiterated
it
is
so
presently
however
he
resumed
does
mlle
polina
like
flowers
i
really
can
not
say
was
my
reply
what
you
can
not
say
he
cried
in
great
astonishment
no
i
have
never
noticed
whether
she
does
so
or
not
i
repeated
with
a
smile
hm
then
i
have
an
idea
in
my
mind
he
concluded
lastly
with
a
nod
he
walked
away
with
a
pleased
expression
on
his
face
the
conversation
had
been
carried
on
in
execrable
french
iv
today
has
been
a
day
of
folly
stupidity
and
ineptness
the
time
is
now
eleven
in
the
evening
and
i
am
sitting
in
my
room
and
thinking
it
all
began
this
morning
with
my
being
forced
to
go
and
play
roulette
for
polina
alexandrovna
when
she
handed
me
over
her
store
of
six
hundred
gulden
i
exacted
two
conditions
namely
that
i
should
not
go
halves
with
her
in
her
winnings
if
any
that
is
to
say
i
should
not
take
anything
for
myself
and
that
she
should
explain
to
me
that
same
evening
why
it
was
so
necessary
for
her
to
win
and
how
much
was
the
sum
which
she
needed
for
i
could
not
suppose
that
she
was
doing
all
this
merely
for
the
sake
of
money
yet
clearly
she
did
need
some
money
and
that
as
soon
as
possible
and
for
a
special
purpose
well
she
promised
to
explain
matters
and
i
departed
there
was
a
tremendous
crowd
in
the
what
an
arrogant
greedy
crowd
it
was
i
pressed
forward
towards
the
middle
of
the
room
until
i
had
secured
a
seat
at
a
croupier
elbow
then
i
began
to
play
in
timid
fashion
venturing
only
twenty
or
thirty
gulden
at
a
time
meanwhile
i
observed
and
took
notes
it
seemed
to
me
that
calculation
was
superfluous
and
by
no
means
possessed
of
the
importance
which
certain
other
players
attached
to
it
even
though
they
sat
with
ruled
papers
in
their
hands
whereon
they
set
down
the
coups
calculated
the
chances
reckoned
staked
and
lost
exactly
as
we
more
simple
mortals
did
who
played
without
any
reckoning
at
all
however
i
deduced
from
the
scene
one
conclusion
which
seemed
to
me
reliable
namely
that
in
the
flow
of
fortuitous
chances
there
is
if
not
a
system
at
all
events
a
sort
of
order
this
of
course
is
a
very
strange
thing
for
instance
after
a
dozen
middle
figures
there
would
always
occur
a
dozen
or
so
outer
ones
suppose
the
ball
stopped
twice
at
a
dozen
outer
figures
it
would
then
pass
to
a
dozen
of
the
first
ones
and
then
again
to
a
dozen
of
the
middle
ciphers
and
fall
upon
them
three
or
four
times
and
then
revert
to
a
dozen
outers
whence
after
another
couple
of
rounds
the
ball
would
again
pass
to
the
first
figures
strike
upon
them
once
and
then
return
thrice
to
the
middle
series
continuing
thus
for
an
hour
and
a
half
or
two
hours
one
three
two
one
three
two
it
was
all
very
curious
again
for
the
whole
of
a
day
or
a
morning
the
red
would
alternate
with
the
black
but
almost
without
any
order
and
from
moment
to
moment
so
that
scarcely
two
consecutive
rounds
would
end
upon
either
the
one
or
the
other
yet
next
day
or
perhaps
the
next
evening
the
red
alone
would
turn
up
and
attain
a
run
of
over
two
score
and
continue
so
for
quite
a
length
of
time
say
for
a
whole
day
of
these
circumstances
the
majority
were
pointed
out
to
me
by
astley
who
stood
by
the
the
whole
morning
yet
never
once
staked
in
person
for
myself
i
lost
all
that
i
had
on
me
and
with
great
speed
to
begin
with
i
staked
two
hundred
gulden
on
even
and
won
then
i
staked
the
same
amount
again
and
won
and
so
on
some
two
or
three
times
at
one
moment
i
must
have
had
in
my
hands
gathered
there
within
a
space
of
five
minutes
about
gulden
that
of
course
was
the
proper
moment
for
me
to
have
departed
but
there
arose
in
me
a
strange
sensation
as
of
a
challenge
to
fate
as
of
a
wish
to
deal
her
a
blow
on
the
cheek
and
to
put
out
my
tongue
at
her
accordingly
i
set
down
the
largest
stake
allowed
by
the
rules
namely
gulden
and
lost
fired
by
this
mishap
i
pulled
out
all
the
money
left
to
me
staked
it
all
on
the
same
venture
and
again
lost
then
i
rose
from
the
table
feeling
as
though
i
were
stupefied
what
had
happened
to
me
i
did
not
know
but
before
luncheon
i
told
polina
of
my
losses
until
which
time
i
walked
about
the
park
at
luncheon
i
was
as
excited
as
i
had
been
at
the
meal
three
days
ago
mlle
blanche
and
the
frenchman
were
lunching
with
us
and
it
appeared
that
the
former
had
been
to
the
casino
that
morning
and
had
seen
my
exploits
there
so
now
she
showed
me
more
attention
when
talking
to
me
while
for
his
part
the
frenchman
approached
me
and
asked
outright
if
it
had
been
my
own
money
that
i
had
lost
he
appeared
to
be
suspicious
as
to
something
being
on
foot
between
polina
and
myself
but
i
merely
fired
up
and
replied
that
the
money
had
been
all
my
own
at
this
the
general
seemed
extremely
surprised
and
asked
me
whence
i
had
procured
it
whereupon
i
replied
that
though
i
had
begun
only
with
gulden
six
or
seven
rounds
had
increased
my
capital
to
or
gulden
and
that
subsequently
i
had
lost
the
whole
in
two
rounds
all
this
of
course
was
plausible
enough
during
my
recital
i
glanced
at
polina
but
nothing
was
to
be
discerned
on
her
face
however
she
had
allowed
me
to
fire
up
without
correcting
me
and
from
that
i
concluded
that
it
was
my
cue
to
fire
up
and
to
conceal
the
fact
that
i
had
been
playing
on
her
behalf
at
all
events
i
thought
to
myself
she
in
her
turn
has
promised
to
give
me
an
explanation
and
to
reveal
to
me
something
or
another
although
the
general
appeared
to
be
taking
stock
of
me
he
said
nothing
yet
i
could
see
uneasiness
and
annoyance
in
his
face
perhaps
his
straitened
circumstances
made
it
hard
for
him
to
have
to
hear
of
piles
of
gold
passing
through
the
hands
of
an
irresponsible
fool
like
myself
within
the
space
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
now
i
have
an
idea
that
last
night
he
and
the
frenchman
had
a
sharp
encounter
with
one
another
at
all
events
they
closeted
themselves
together
and
then
had
a
long
and
vehement
discussion
after
which
the
frenchman
departed
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
passion
but
returned
early
this
morning
to
renew
the
combat
on
hearing
of
my
losses
however
he
only
remarked
with
a
sharp
and
even
a
malicious
air
that
a
man
ought
to
go
more
carefully
next
for
some
reason
or
another
he
added
that
though
a
great
many
russians
go
in
for
gambling
they
are
no
good
at
the
game
i
think
that
roulette
was
devised
specially
for
russians
i
retorted
and
when
the
frenchman
smiled
contemptuously
at
my
reply
i
further
remarked
that
i
was
sure
i
was
right
also
that
speaking
of
russians
in
the
capacity
of
gamblers
i
had
far
more
blame
for
them
than
praise
of
that
he
could
be
quite
sure
upon
what
do
you
base
your
opinion
he
inquired
upon
the
fact
that
to
the
virtues
and
merits
of
the
civilised
westerner
there
has
become
historically
added
though
this
is
not
his
chief
point
a
capacity
for
acquiring
capital
whereas
not
only
is
the
russian
incapable
of
acquiring
capital
but
also
he
exhausts
it
wantonly
and
of
sheer
folly
none
the
less
we
russians
often
need
money
wherefore
we
are
glad
of
and
greatly
devoted
to
a
method
of
acquisition
like
roulette
whereby
in
a
couple
of
hours
one
may
grow
rich
without
doing
any
work
this
method
i
repeat
has
a
great
attraction
for
us
but
since
we
play
in
wanton
fashion
and
without
taking
any
trouble
we
almost
invariably
lose
to
a
certain
extent
that
is
true
assented
the
frenchman
with
a
air
oh
no
it
is
not
true
put
in
the
general
sternly
and
you
he
added
to
me
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
for
traducing
your
own
country
i
beg
pardon
i
said
yet
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
which
is
the
worst
of
the
two
russian
ineptitude
or
the
german
method
of
growing
rich
through
honest
toil
what
an
extraordinary
idea
cried
the
general
and
what
a
russian
idea
added
the
frenchman
i
smiled
for
i
was
rather
glad
to
have
a
quarrel
with
them
i
would
rather
live
a
wandering
life
in
tents
i
cried
than
bow
the
knee
to
a
german
idol
to
what
idol
exclaimed
the
general
now
seriously
angry
to
the
german
method
of
heaping
up
riches
i
have
not
been
here
very
long
but
i
can
tell
you
that
what
i
have
seen
and
verified
makes
my
tartar
blood
boil
good
lord
i
wish
for
no
virtues
of
that
kind
yesterday
i
went
for
a
walk
of
about
ten
versts
and
everywhere
i
found
that
things
were
even
as
we
read
of
them
in
good
german
that
every
house
has
its
who
is
horribly
beneficent
and
extraordinarily
honourable
so
honourable
is
he
that
it
is
dreadful
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
and
i
can
not
bear
people
of
that
sort
each
such
has
his
family
and
in
the
evenings
they
read
improving
books
aloud
over
their
there
murmur
elms
and
chestnuts
the
sun
has
sunk
to
his
rest
a
stork
is
roosting
on
the
gable
and
all
is
beautifully
poetic
and
touching
do
not
be
angry
general
let
me
tell
you
something
that
is
even
more
touching
than
that
i
can
remember
how
of
an
evening
my
own
father
now
dead
used
to
sit
under
the
lime
trees
in
his
little
garden
and
to
read
books
aloud
to
myself
and
my
mother
yes
i
know
how
things
ought
to
be
done
yet
every
german
family
is
bound
to
slavery
and
to
submission
to
its
they
work
like
oxen
and
amass
wealth
like
jews
suppose
the
has
put
by
a
certain
number
of
gulden
which
he
hands
over
to
his
eldest
son
in
order
that
the
said
son
may
acquire
a
trade
or
a
small
plot
of
land
well
one
result
is
to
deprive
the
daughter
of
a
dowry
and
so
leave
her
among
the
unwedded
for
the
same
reason
the
parents
will
have
to
sell
the
younger
son
into
bondage
or
the
ranks
of
the
army
in
order
that
he
may
earn
more
towards
the
family
capital
yes
such
things
are
done
for
i
have
been
making
inquiries
on
the
subject
it
is
all
done
out
of
sheer
rectitude
out
of
a
rectitude
which
is
magnified
to
the
point
of
the
younger
son
believing
that
he
has
been
rightly
sold
and
that
it
is
simply
idyllic
for
the
victim
to
rejoice
when
he
is
made
over
into
pledge
what
more
have
i
to
tell
well
this
that
matters
bear
just
as
hardly
upon
the
eldest
son
perhaps
he
has
his
gretchen
to
whom
his
heart
is
bound
but
he
can
not
marry
her
for
the
reason
that
he
has
not
yet
amassed
sufficient
gulden
so
the
pair
wait
on
in
a
mood
of
sincere
and
virtuous
expectation
and
smilingly
deposit
themselves
in
pawn
the
while
gretchen
cheeks
grow
sunken
and
she
begins
to
wither
until
at
last
after
some
twenty
years
their
substance
has
multiplied
and
sufficient
gulden
have
been
honourably
and
virtuously
accumulated
then
the
blesses
his
heir
and
the
gretchen
with
the
sunken
bosom
and
the
scarlet
nose
after
which
he
bursts
into
tears
reads
the
pair
a
lesson
on
morality
and
dies
in
turn
the
eldest
son
becomes
a
virtuous
and
the
old
story
begins
again
in
fifty
or
sixty
years
time
the
grandson
of
the
original
will
have
amassed
a
considerable
sum
and
that
sum
he
will
hand
over
to
his
son
and
the
latter
to
his
son
and
so
on
for
several
generations
until
at
length
there
will
issue
a
baron
rothschild
or
a
and
company
or
the
devil
knows
what
is
it
not
a
beautiful
spectacle
the
spectacle
of
a
century
or
two
of
inherited
labour
patience
intellect
rectitude
character
perseverance
and
calculation
with
a
stork
sitting
on
the
roof
above
it
all
what
is
more
they
think
there
can
never
be
anything
better
than
this
wherefore
from
their
point
of
view
they
begin
to
judge
the
rest
of
the
world
and
to
censure
all
who
are
at
fault
that
is
to
say
who
are
not
exactly
like
themselves
yes
there
you
have
it
in
a
nutshell
for
my
own
part
i
would
rather
grow
fat
after
the
russian
manner
or
squander
my
whole
substance
at
roulette
i
have
no
wish
to
be
and
company
at
the
end
of
five
generations
i
want
the
money
for
myself
for
in
no
way
do
i
look
upon
my
personality
as
necessary
to
or
meet
to
be
given
over
to
capital
i
may
be
wrong
but
there
you
have
it
those
are
my
views
how
far
you
may
be
right
in
what
you
have
said
i
do
not
know
remarked
the
general
moodily
but
i
do
know
that
you
are
becoming
an
insufferable
farceur
whenever
you
are
given
the
least
chance
as
usual
he
left
his
sentence
unfinished
indeed
whenever
he
embarked
upon
anything
that
in
the
least
exceeded
the
limits
of
daily
he
left
unfinished
what
he
was
saying
the
frenchman
had
listened
to
me
contemptuously
with
a
slight
protruding
of
his
eyes
but
he
could
not
have
understood
very
much
of
my
harangue
as
for
polina
she
had
looked
on
with
serene
indifference
she
seemed
to
have
heard
neither
my
voice
nor
any
other
during
the
progress
of
the
meal
v
yes
she
had
been
extraordinarily
meditative
yet
on
leaving
the
table
she
immediately
ordered
me
to
accompany
her
for
a
walk
we
took
the
children
with
us
and
set
out
for
the
fountain
in
the
park
i
was
in
such
an
irritated
frame
of
mind
that
in
rude
and
abrupt
fashion
i
blurted
out
a
question
as
to
why
our
marquis
de
griers
had
ceased
to
accompany
her
for
strolls
or
to
speak
to
her
for
days
together
because
he
is
a
brute
she
replied
in
rather
a
curious
way
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
heard
her
speak
so
of
de
griers
consequently
i
was
momentarily
awed
into
silence
by
this
expression
of
resentment
have
you
noticed
too
that
today
he
is
by
no
means
on
good
terms
with
the
general
i
went
on
yes
and
i
suppose
you
want
to
know
why
she
replied
with
dry
captiousness
you
are
aware
are
you
not
that
the
general
is
mortgaged
to
the
marquis
with
all
his
property
consequently
if
the
general
mother
does
not
die
the
frenchman
will
become
the
absolute
possessor
of
everything
which
he
now
holds
only
in
pledge
then
it
is
really
the
case
that
everything
is
mortgaged
i
have
heard
rumours
to
that
effect
but
was
unaware
how
far
they
might
be
true
yes
they
are
true
what
then
why
it
will
be
a
case
of
mlle
blanche
i
remarked
for
in
such
an
event
she
would
never
become
madame
general
do
you
know
i
believe
the
old
man
is
so
much
in
love
with
her
that
he
will
shoot
himself
if
she
should
throw
him
over
at
his
age
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
fall
in
love
yes
something
i
believe
will
happen
to
him
assented
polina
thoughtfully
and
what
a
fine
thing
it
all
is
i
continued
could
anything
be
more
abominable
than
the
way
in
which
she
has
agreed
to
marry
for
money
alone
not
one
of
the
decencies
has
been
observed
the
whole
affair
has
taken
place
without
the
least
ceremony
and
as
for
the
grandmother
what
could
be
more
comical
yet
more
dastardly
than
the
sending
of
telegram
after
telegram
to
know
if
she
is
dead
what
do
you
think
of
it
polina
alexandrovna
yes
it
is
very
horrible
she
interrupted
with
a
shudder
consequently
i
am
the
more
surprised
that
you
should
be
so
cheerful
what
are
you
so
pleased
about
about
the
fact
that
you
have
gone
and
lost
my
money
what
the
money
that
you
gave
me
to
lose
i
told
you
i
should
never
win
for
other
people
least
of
all
for
you
i
obeyed
you
simply
because
you
ordered
me
to
but
you
must
not
blame
me
for
the
result
i
warned
you
that
no
good
would
ever
come
of
it
you
seem
much
depressed
at
having
lost
your
money
why
do
you
need
it
so
greatly
why
do
you
ask
me
these
questions
because
you
promised
to
explain
matters
to
me
listen
i
am
certain
that
as
soon
as
ever
i
to
play
for
myself
and
i
still
have
gulden
left
i
shall
win
you
can
then
take
of
me
what
you
require
she
made
a
contemptuous
grimace
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
i
continued
for
making
such
a
proposal
i
am
so
conscious
of
being
only
a
nonentity
in
your
eyes
that
you
need
not
mind
accepting
money
from
me
a
gift
from
me
could
not
possibly
offend
you
moreover
it
was
i
who
lost
your
gulden
she
glanced
at
me
but
seeing
that
i
was
in
an
irritable
sarcastic
mood
changed
the
subject
my
affairs
can
not
possibly
interest
you
she
said
still
if
you
do
wish
to
know
i
am
in
debt
i
borrowed
some
money
and
must
pay
it
back
again
i
have
a
curious
senseless
idea
that
i
am
bound
to
win
at
the
why
i
think
so
i
can
not
tell
but
i
do
think
so
and
with
some
assurance
perhaps
it
is
because
of
that
assurance
that
i
now
find
myself
without
any
other
resource
or
perhaps
it
is
because
it
is
so
necessary
for
you
to
win
it
is
like
a
drowning
man
catching
at
a
straw
you
yourself
will
agree
that
unless
he
were
drowning
he
would
not
mistake
a
straw
for
the
trunk
of
a
tree
polina
looked
surprised
what
she
said
do
not
you
also
hope
something
from
it
did
you
not
tell
me
again
and
again
two
weeks
ago
that
you
were
certain
of
winning
at
roulette
if
you
played
here
and
did
you
not
ask
me
not
to
consider
you
a
fool
for
doing
so
were
you
joking
you
can
not
have
been
for
i
remember
that
you
spoke
with
a
gravity
which
forbade
the
idea
of
your
jesting
true
i
replied
gloomily
i
always
felt
certain
that
i
should
win
indeed
what
you
say
makes
me
ask
myself
why
have
my
absurd
senseless
losses
of
today
raised
a
doubt
in
my
mind
yet
i
am
still
positive
that
so
soon
as
ever
i
begin
to
play
for
myself
i
shall
infallibly
win
and
why
are
you
so
certain
to
tell
the
truth
i
do
not
know
i
only
know
that
i
must
win
that
it
is
the
one
resource
i
have
left
yes
why
do
i
feel
so
assured
on
the
point
perhaps
because
one
can
not
help
winning
if
one
is
fanatically
certain
of
doing
so
yet
i
dare
wager
that
you
do
not
think
me
capable
of
serious
feeling
in
the
matter
i
do
not
care
whether
you
are
so
or
not
answered
polina
with
calm
indifference
well
since
you
ask
me
i
do
doubt
your
ability
to
take
anything
seriously
you
are
capable
of
worrying
but
not
deeply
you
are
too
and
unsettled
a
person
for
that
but
why
do
you
want
money
not
a
single
one
of
the
reasons
which
you
have
given
can
be
looked
upon
as
serious
by
the
way
i
interrupted
you
say
you
want
to
pay
off
a
debt
it
must
be
a
large
one
is
it
to
the
frenchman
what
do
you
mean
by
asking
all
these
questions
you
are
very
clever
today
surely
you
are
not
drunk
you
know
that
you
and
i
stand
on
no
ceremony
and
that
sometimes
i
put
to
you
very
plain
questions
i
repeat
that
i
am
your
slave
and
slaves
can
not
be
shamed
or
offended
you
talk
like
a
child
it
is
always
possible
to
comport
oneself
with
dignity
if
one
has
a
quarrel
it
ought
to
elevate
rather
than
to
degrade
one
a
maxim
straight
from
the
copybook
suppose
i
can
not
comport
myself
with
dignity
by
that
i
mean
that
though
i
am
a
man
of
i
am
unable
to
carry
off
a
situation
properly
do
you
know
the
reason
it
is
because
we
russians
are
too
richly
and
multifariously
gifted
to
be
able
at
once
to
find
the
proper
mode
of
expression
it
is
all
a
question
of
mode
most
of
us
are
so
bounteously
endowed
with
intellect
as
to
require
also
a
spice
of
genius
to
choose
the
right
form
of
behaviour
and
genius
is
lacking
in
us
for
the
reason
that
so
little
genius
at
all
exists
it
belongs
only
to
the
french
though
a
few
other
europeans
have
elaborated
their
forms
so
well
as
to
be
able
to
figure
with
extreme
dignity
and
yet
be
wholly
undignified
persons
that
is
why
with
us
the
mode
is
so
the
frenchman
may
receive
an
insult
a
real
a
venomous
insult
yet
he
will
not
so
much
as
frown
but
a
tweaking
of
the
nose
he
can
not
bear
for
the
reason
that
such
an
act
is
an
infringement
of
the
accepted
of
the
order
of
decorum
that
is
why
our
good
ladies
are
so
fond
of
frenchmen
the
frenchman
manners
they
say
are
perfect
but
in
my
opinion
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
frenchman
manners
the
frenchman
is
only
a
bird
the
coq
gaulois
at
the
same
time
as
i
am
not
a
woman
i
do
not
properly
understand
the
question
cocks
may
be
excellent
birds
if
i
am
wrong
you
must
stop
me
you
ought
to
stop
and
correct
me
more
often
when
i
am
speaking
to
you
for
i
am
too
apt
to
say
everything
that
is
in
my
head
you
see
i
have
lost
my
manners
i
agree
that
i
have
none
nor
yet
any
dignity
i
will
tell
you
why
i
set
no
store
upon
such
things
everything
in
me
has
undergone
a
cheek
you
know
the
reason
i
have
not
a
single
human
thought
in
my
head
for
a
long
while
i
have
been
ignorant
of
what
is
going
on
in
the
world
here
or
in
russia
i
have
been
to
dresden
yet
am
completely
in
the
dark
as
to
what
dresden
is
like
you
know
the
cause
of
my
obsession
i
have
no
hope
now
and
am
a
mere
cipher
in
your
eyes
wherefore
i
tell
you
outright
that
wherever
i
go
i
see
only
you
all
the
rest
is
a
matter
of
indifference
why
or
how
i
have
come
to
love
you
i
do
not
know
it
may
be
that
you
are
not
altogether
fair
to
look
upon
do
you
know
i
am
ignorant
even
as
to
what
your
face
is
like
in
all
probability
too
your
heart
is
not
comely
and
it
is
possible
that
your
mind
is
wholly
ignoble
and
because
you
do
not
believe
in
my
nobility
of
soul
you
think
to
purchase
me
with
money
she
said
when
have
i
thought
to
do
so
was
my
reply
you
are
losing
the
thread
of
the
argument
if
you
do
not
wish
to
purchase
me
at
all
events
you
wish
to
purchase
my
respect
not
at
all
i
have
told
you
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
explain
myself
you
are
hard
upon
me
do
not
be
angry
at
my
chattering
you
know
why
you
ought
not
to
be
angry
with
me
that
i
am
simply
an
imbecile
however
i
do
not
mind
if
you
are
angry
sitting
in
my
room
i
need
but
to
think
of
you
to
imagine
to
myself
the
rustle
of
your
dress
and
at
once
i
fall
almost
to
biting
my
hands
why
should
you
be
angry
with
me
because
i
call
myself
your
slave
revel
i
pray
you
in
my
slavery
revel
in
it
do
you
know
that
sometimes
i
could
kill
you
not
because
i
do
not
love
you
or
am
jealous
of
you
but
because
i
feel
as
though
i
could
simply
devour
you
you
are
laughing
no
i
am
not
she
retorted
but
i
order
you
nevertheless
to
be
silent
she
stopped
well
nigh
breathless
with
anger
god
knows
she
may
not
have
been
a
beautiful
woman
yet
i
loved
to
see
her
come
to
a
halt
like
this
and
was
therefore
the
more
fond
of
arousing
her
temper
perhaps
she
divined
this
and
for
that
very
reason
gave
way
to
rage
i
said
as
much
to
her
what
rubbish
she
cried
with
a
shudder
i
do
not
care
i
continued
also
do
you
know
that
it
is
not
safe
for
us
to
take
walks
together
often
i
have
a
feeling
that
i
should
like
to
strike
you
to
disfigure
you
to
strangle
you
are
you
certain
that
it
will
never
come
to
that
you
are
driving
me
to
frenzy
am
i
afraid
of
a
scandal
or
of
your
anger
why
should
i
fear
your
anger
i
love
without
hope
and
know
that
hereafter
i
shall
love
you
a
thousand
times
more
if
ever
i
should
kill
you
i
should
have
to
kill
myself
too
but
i
shall
put
off
doing
so
as
long
as
possible
for
i
wish
to
continue
enjoying
the
unbearable
pain
which
your
coldness
gives
me
do
you
know
a
very
strange
thing
it
is
that
with
every
day
my
love
for
you
increases
though
that
would
seem
to
be
almost
an
impossibility
why
should
i
not
become
a
fatalist
remember
how
on
the
third
day
that
we
ascended
the
shlangenberg
i
was
moved
to
whisper
in
your
ear
but
the
word
and
i
will
leap
into
the
abyss
had
you
said
it
i
should
have
leapt
do
you
not
believe
me
what
stupid
rubbish
she
cried
i
care
not
whether
it
be
wise
or
stupid
i
cried
in
return
i
only
know
that
in
your
presence
i
must
speak
speak
speak
therefore
i
am
speaking
i
lose
all
conceit
when
i
am
with
you
and
everything
ceases
to
matter
why
should
i
have
wanted
you
to
leap
from
the
shlangenberg
she
said
drily
and
i
think
with
wilful
offensiveness
that
would
have
been
of
no
use
to
me
splendid
i
shouted
i
know
well
that
you
must
have
used
the
words
no
use
in
order
to
crush
me
i
can
see
through
you
no
use
did
you
say
why
to
give
pleasure
is
always
of
use
and
as
for
barbarous
unlimited
power
even
if
it
be
only
over
a
fly
why
it
is
a
kind
of
luxury
man
is
a
despot
by
nature
and
loves
to
torture
you
in
particular
love
to
do
so
i
remember
that
at
this
moment
she
looked
at
me
in
a
peculiar
way
the
fact
is
that
my
face
must
have
been
expressing
all
the
maze
of
senseless
gross
sensations
which
were
seething
within
me
to
this
day
i
can
remember
word
for
word
the
conversation
as
i
have
written
it
down
my
eyes
were
suffused
with
blood
and
the
foam
had
caked
itself
on
my
lips
also
on
my
honour
i
swear
that
had
she
bidden
me
cast
myself
from
the
summit
of
the
shlangenberg
i
should
have
done
it
yes
had
she
bidden
me
in
jest
or
only
in
contempt
and
with
a
spit
in
my
face
i
should
have
cast
myself
down
oh
no
why
so
i
believe
you
she
said
but
in
such
a
manner
in
the
manner
of
which
at
times
she
was
a
mistress
and
with
such
a
note
of
disdain
and
viperish
arrogance
in
her
tone
that
god
knows
i
could
have
killed
her
yes
at
that
moment
she
stood
in
peril
i
had
not
lied
to
her
about
that
surely
you
are
not
a
coward
suddenly
she
asked
me
i
do
not
know
i
replied
perhaps
i
am
but
i
do
not
know
i
have
long
given
up
thinking
about
such
things
if
i
said
to
you
that
man
would
you
kill
him
whom
whomsoever
i
wish
the
frenchman
do
not
ask
me
questions
return
me
answers
i
repeat
whomsoever
i
wish
i
desire
to
see
if
you
were
speaking
seriously
just
now
she
awaited
my
reply
with
such
gravity
and
impatience
that
i
found
the
situation
unpleasant
do
you
rather
tell
me
i
said
what
is
going
on
here
why
do
you
seem
of
me
i
can
see
for
myself
what
is
wrong
you
are
the
of
a
ruined
and
insensate
man
who
is
smitten
with
love
for
this
devil
of
a
blanche
and
there
is
this
frenchman
too
with
his
mysterious
influence
over
you
yet
you
actually
ask
me
such
a
question
if
you
do
not
tell
me
how
things
stand
i
shall
have
to
put
in
my
oar
and
do
something
are
you
ashamed
to
be
frank
with
me
are
you
shy
of
me
i
am
not
going
to
talk
to
you
on
that
subject
i
have
asked
you
a
question
and
am
waiting
for
an
answer
well
then
i
will
kill
whomsoever
you
wish
i
said
but
are
you
really
going
to
bid
me
do
such
deeds
why
should
you
think
that
i
am
going
to
let
you
off
i
shall
bid
you
do
it
or
else
renounce
me
could
you
ever
do
the
latter
no
you
know
that
you
could
you
would
first
kill
whom
i
had
bidden
you
and
then
kill
me
for
having
dared
to
send
you
away
something
seemed
to
strike
upon
my
brain
as
i
heard
these
words
of
course
at
the
time
i
took
them
half
in
jest
and
half
as
a
challenge
yet
she
had
spoken
them
with
great
seriousness
i
felt
thunderstruck
that
she
should
so
express
herself
that
she
should
assert
such
a
right
over
me
that
she
should
assume
such
authority
and
say
outright
either
you
kill
whom
i
bid
you
or
i
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
indeed
in
what
she
had
said
there
was
something
so
cynical
and
unveiled
as
to
pass
all
bounds
for
how
could
she
ever
regard
me
as
the
same
after
the
killing
was
done
this
was
more
than
slavery
and
abasement
it
was
sufficient
to
bring
a
man
back
to
his
right
senses
yet
despite
the
outrageous
improbability
of
our
conversation
my
heart
shook
within
me
suddenly
she
burst
out
laughing
we
were
seated
on
a
bench
near
the
spot
where
the
children
were
playing
just
opposite
the
point
in
the
before
the
casino
where
the
carriages
drew
up
in
order
to
set
down
their
occupants
do
you
see
that
fat
baroness
she
cried
it
is
the
baroness
burmergelm
she
arrived
three
days
ago
just
look
at
her
husband
that
tall
wizened
prussian
there
with
the
stick
in
his
hand
do
you
remember
how
he
stared
at
us
the
other
day
well
go
to
the
baroness
take
off
your
hat
to
her
and
say
something
in
french
why
because
you
have
sworn
that
you
would
leap
from
the
shlangenberg
for
my
sake
and
that
you
would
kill
any
one
whom
i
might
bid
you
kill
well
instead
of
such
murders
and
tragedies
i
wish
only
for
a
good
laugh
go
without
answering
me
and
let
me
see
the
baron
give
you
a
sound
thrashing
with
his
stick
then
you
throw
me
out
a
challenge
you
think
that
i
will
not
do
it
yes
i
do
challenge
you
go
for
such
is
my
will
then
i
will
go
however
mad
be
your
fancy
only
look
here
shall
you
not
be
doing
the
general
a
great
disservice
as
well
as
through
him
a
great
disservice
to
yourself
it
is
not
about
myself
i
am
worrying
it
is
about
you
and
the
general
why
for
a
mere
fancy
should
i
go
and
insult
a
woman
ah
then
i
can
see
that
you
are
only
a
trifler
she
said
contemptuously
your
eyes
are
swimming
with
blood
but
only
because
you
have
drunk
a
little
too
much
at
luncheon
do
i
not
know
that
what
i
have
asked
you
to
do
is
foolish
and
wrong
and
that
the
general
will
be
angry
about
it
but
i
want
to
have
a
good
laugh
all
the
same
i
want
that
and
nothing
else
why
should
you
insult
a
woman
indeed
well
you
will
be
given
a
sound
thrashing
for
so
doing
i
turned
away
and
went
silently
to
do
her
bidding
of
course
the
thing
was
folly
but
i
could
not
get
out
of
it
i
remember
that
as
i
approached
the
baroness
i
felt
as
excited
as
a
schoolboy
i
was
in
a
frenzy
as
though
i
were
drunk
vi
two
days
have
passed
since
that
day
of
lunacy
what
a
noise
and
a
fuss
and
a
chattering
and
an
uproar
there
was
and
what
a
welter
of
unseemliness
and
disorder
and
stupidity
and
bad
manners
and
i
the
cause
of
it
all
yet
part
of
the
scene
was
also
ridiculous
at
all
events
to
myself
it
was
so
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
was
the
matter
with
me
whether
i
was
merely
stupefied
or
whether
i
purposely
broke
loose
and
ran
amok
at
times
my
mind
seems
all
confused
while
at
other
times
i
seem
almost
to
be
back
in
my
childhood
at
the
school
desk
and
to
have
done
the
deed
simply
out
of
mischief
it
all
came
of
polina
yes
of
polina
but
for
her
there
might
never
have
been
a
fracas
or
perhaps
i
did
the
deed
in
a
fit
of
despair
though
it
may
be
foolish
of
me
to
think
so
what
there
is
so
attractive
about
her
i
can
not
think
yet
there
is
something
attractive
about
her
something
passing
fair
it
would
seem
others
besides
myself
she
has
driven
to
distraction
she
is
tall
and
straight
and
very
slim
her
body
looks
as
though
it
could
be
tied
into
a
knot
or
bent
double
like
a
cord
the
imprint
of
her
foot
is
long
and
narrow
it
is
a
maddening
imprint
yes
simply
a
maddening
one
and
her
hair
has
a
reddish
tint
about
it
and
her
eyes
are
like
cat
eyes
though
able
also
to
glance
with
proud
disdainful
mien
on
the
evening
of
my
first
arrival
four
months
ago
i
remember
that
she
was
sitting
and
holding
an
animated
conversation
with
de
griers
in
the
salon
and
the
way
in
which
she
looked
at
him
was
such
that
later
when
i
retired
to
my
own
room
upstairs
i
kept
fancying
that
she
had
smitten
him
in
the
face
that
she
had
smitten
him
right
on
the
cheek
so
peculiar
had
been
her
look
as
she
stood
confronting
him
ever
since
that
evening
i
have
loved
her
but
to
my
tale
i
stepped
from
the
path
into
the
and
took
my
stand
in
the
middle
of
it
there
i
awaited
the
baron
and
the
baroness
when
they
were
but
a
few
paces
distant
from
me
i
took
off
my
hat
and
bowed
i
remember
that
the
baroness
was
clad
in
a
voluminous
silk
dress
pale
grey
in
colour
and
adorned
with
flounces
and
a
crinoline
and
train
also
she
was
short
and
inordinately
stout
while
her
gross
flabby
chin
completely
concealed
her
neck
her
face
was
purple
and
the
little
eyes
in
it
had
an
impudent
malicious
expression
yet
she
walked
as
though
she
were
conferring
a
favour
upon
everybody
by
so
doing
as
for
the
baron
he
was
tall
wizened
after
the
german
fashion
spectacled
and
apparently
about
years
of
age
also
he
had
legs
which
seemed
to
begin
almost
at
his
chest
or
rather
at
his
chin
yet
for
all
his
air
of
conceit
his
clothes
sagged
a
little
and
his
face
wore
a
sheepish
air
which
might
have
passed
for
profundity
these
details
i
noted
within
a
space
of
a
few
seconds
at
first
my
bow
and
the
fact
that
i
had
my
hat
in
my
hand
barely
caught
their
attention
the
baron
only
scowled
a
little
and
the
baroness
swept
straight
on
madame
la
baronne
said
i
loudly
and
distinctly
embroidering
each
word
as
it
were
votre
esclave
then
i
bowed
again
put
on
my
hat
and
walked
past
the
baron
with
a
rude
smile
on
my
face
polina
had
ordered
me
merely
to
take
off
my
hat
the
bow
and
the
general
effrontery
were
of
my
own
invention
god
knows
what
instigated
me
to
perpetrate
the
outrage
in
my
frenzy
i
felt
as
though
i
were
walking
on
air
hein
ejaculated
or
rather
growled
the
baron
as
he
turned
towards
me
in
angry
surprise
i
too
turned
round
and
stood
waiting
in
expectation
yet
still
i
wore
on
my
face
an
impudent
smile
as
i
gazed
at
him
he
seemed
to
hesitate
and
his
brows
contracted
to
their
utmost
limits
every
moment
his
visage
was
growing
darker
the
baroness
also
turned
in
my
direction
and
gazed
at
me
in
wrathful
perplexity
while
some
of
the
also
began
to
stare
at
us
and
others
of
them
halted
outright
hein
the
baron
vociferated
again
with
a
redoubled
growl
and
a
note
of
growing
wrath
in
his
voice
ja
wohl
i
replied
still
looking
him
in
the
eyes
sind
sie
rasend
he
exclaimed
brandishing
his
stick
and
apparently
beginning
to
feel
nervous
perhaps
it
was
my
costume
which
intimidated
him
for
i
was
well
and
fashionably
dressed
after
the
manner
of
a
man
who
belongs
to
indisputably
good
society
ja
cried
i
again
with
all
my
might
with
a
longdrawn
rolling
of
the
ohl
sound
after
the
fashion
of
the
berliners
who
constantly
use
the
phrase
ja
wohl
in
conversation
and
more
or
less
prolong
the
syllable
ohl
according
as
they
desire
to
express
different
shades
of
meaning
or
of
mood
at
this
the
baron
and
the
baroness
faced
sharply
about
and
almost
fled
in
their
alarm
some
of
the
bystanders
gave
vent
to
excited
exclamations
and
others
remained
staring
at
me
in
astonishment
but
i
do
not
remember
the
details
very
well
wheeling
quietly
about
i
returned
in
the
direction
of
polina
alexandrovna
but
when
i
had
got
within
a
hundred
paces
of
her
seat
i
saw
her
rise
and
set
out
with
the
children
towards
the
hotel
at
the
portico
i
caught
up
to
her
i
have
perpetrated
the
the
piece
of
idiocy
i
said
as
i
came
level
with
her
have
you
then
you
can
take
the
consequences
she
replied
without
so
much
as
looking
at
me
then
she
moved
towards
the
staircase
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
walking
in
the
park
thence
i
passed
into
the
forest
and
walked
on
until
i
found
myself
in
a
neighbouring
principality
at
a
wayside
restaurant
i
partook
of
an
omelette
and
some
wine
and
was
charged
for
the
idyllic
repast
a
thaler
and
a
half
not
until
eleven
did
i
return
home
to
find
a
summons
awaiting
me
from
the
general
our
party
occupied
two
suites
in
the
hotel
each
of
which
contained
two
rooms
the
first
the
larger
suite
comprised
a
salon
and
a
with
adjoining
the
latter
the
general
study
it
was
here
that
he
was
awaiting
me
as
he
stood
posed
in
a
majestic
attitude
beside
his
lolling
on
a
divan
close
by
was
de
griers
my
good
sir
the
general
began
may
i
ask
you
what
this
is
that
you
have
gone
and
done
i
should
be
glad
i
replied
if
we
could
come
straight
to
the
point
probably
you
are
referring
to
my
encounter
of
today
with
a
german
with
a
german
why
the
german
was
the
baron
burmergelm
a
most
important
personage
i
hear
that
you
have
been
rude
both
to
him
and
to
the
baroness
no
i
have
not
but
i
understand
that
you
simply
terrified
them
my
good
sir
shouted
the
general
not
in
the
least
i
replied
you
must
know
that
when
i
was
in
berlin
i
frequently
used
to
hear
the
berliners
repeat
and
repellently
prolong
a
certain
phrase
namely
wohl
and
happening
to
meet
this
couple
in
the
i
found
for
some
reason
or
another
that
this
phrase
suddenly
recurred
to
my
memory
and
exercised
a
rousing
effect
upon
my
spirits
moreover
on
the
three
previous
occasions
that
i
have
met
the
baroness
she
has
walked
towards
me
as
though
i
were
a
worm
which
could
easily
be
crushed
with
the
foot
not
unnaturally
i
too
possess
a
measure
of
wherefore
on
this
occasion
i
took
off
my
hat
and
said
politely
yes
i
assure
you
it
was
said
politely
votre
esclave
then
the
baron
turned
round
and
said
whereupon
i
felt
moved
to
ejaculate
in
answer
wohl
twice
i
shouted
it
at
him
the
first
time
in
an
ordinary
tone
and
the
second
time
with
the
greatest
prolonging
of
the
words
of
which
i
was
capable
that
is
all
i
must
confess
that
this
puerile
explanation
gave
me
great
pleasure
i
felt
a
strong
desire
to
overlay
the
incident
with
an
even
added
measure
of
grossness
so
the
further
i
proceeded
the
more
did
the
gusto
of
my
proceeding
increase
you
are
only
making
fun
of
me
vociferated
the
general
as
turning
to
the
frenchman
he
declared
that
my
bringing
about
of
the
incident
had
been
gratuitous
de
griers
smiled
contemptuously
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
do
not
think
that
i
put
in
it
was
not
so
at
all
i
grant
you
that
my
behaviour
was
bad
i
fully
confess
that
it
was
so
and
make
no
secret
of
the
fact
i
would
even
go
so
far
as
to
grant
you
that
my
behaviour
might
well
be
called
stupid
and
indecent
tomfoolery
but
more
than
that
it
was
not
also
let
me
tell
you
that
i
am
very
sorry
for
my
conduct
yet
there
is
one
circumstance
which
in
my
eyes
almost
absolves
me
from
regret
in
the
matter
of
late
that
is
to
say
for
the
last
two
or
three
weeks
i
have
been
feeling
not
at
all
well
that
is
to
say
i
have
been
in
a
sick
nervous
irritable
fanciful
condition
so
that
i
have
periodically
lost
control
over
myself
for
instance
on
more
than
one
occasion
i
have
tried
to
pick
a
quarrel
even
with
monsieur
le
marquise
here
and
under
the
circumstances
he
had
no
choice
but
to
answer
me
in
short
i
have
recently
been
showing
signs
of
whether
the
baroness
burmergelm
will
take
this
circumstance
into
consideration
when
i
come
to
beg
her
pardon
for
i
do
intend
to
make
her
amends
i
do
not
know
but
i
doubt
if
she
will
and
the
less
so
since
so
far
as
i
know
the
circumstance
is
one
which
of
late
has
begun
to
be
abused
in
the
legal
world
in
that
advocates
in
criminal
cases
have
taken
to
justifying
their
clients
on
the
ground
that
at
the
moment
of
the
crime
they
the
clients
were
unconscious
of
what
they
were
doing
that
in
short
they
were
out
of
health
client
committed
the
murder
that
is
true
but
he
has
no
recollection
of
having
committed
it
and
doctors
actually
support
these
advocates
by
affirming
that
there
really
is
such
a
malady
that
there
really
can
arise
temporary
delusions
which
make
a
man
remember
nothing
of
a
given
deed
or
only
a
half
or
a
quarter
of
it
but
the
baron
and
baroness
are
members
of
an
older
generation
as
well
as
prussian
junkers
and
landowners
to
them
such
a
process
in
the
world
will
be
unknown
and
therefore
they
are
the
more
unlikely
to
accept
any
such
explanation
what
is
your
opinion
about
it
general
enough
sir
he
thundered
with
barely
restrained
fury
enough
i
say
once
and
for
all
i
must
endeavour
to
rid
myself
of
you
and
your
impertinence
to
justify
yourself
in
the
eyes
of
the
baron
and
baroness
will
be
impossible
any
intercourse
with
you
even
though
it
be
confined
to
a
begging
of
their
pardons
they
would
look
upon
as
a
degradation
i
may
tell
you
that
on
learning
that
you
formed
part
of
my
household
the
baron
approached
me
in
the
casino
and
demanded
of
me
additional
satisfaction
do
you
understand
then
what
it
is
that
you
have
entailed
upon
me
upon
me
my
good
sir
you
have
entailed
upon
me
the
fact
of
my
being
forced
to
sue
humbly
to
the
baron
and
to
give
him
my
word
of
honour
that
this
very
day
you
shall
cease
to
belong
to
my
establishment
excuse
me
general
i
interrupted
but
did
he
make
an
express
point
of
it
that
i
should
to
belong
to
your
establishment
as
you
call
it
no
i
of
my
own
initiative
thought
that
i
ought
to
afford
him
that
satisfaction
and
with
it
he
was
satisfied
so
we
must
part
good
sir
it
is
my
duty
to
hand
over
to
you
forty
gulden
three
florins
as
per
the
accompanying
statement
here
is
the
money
and
here
the
account
which
you
are
at
liberty
to
verify
farewell
from
henceforth
we
are
strangers
from
you
i
have
never
had
anything
but
trouble
and
unpleasantness
i
am
about
to
call
the
landlord
and
explain
to
him
that
from
tomorrow
onwards
i
shall
no
longer
be
responsible
for
your
hotel
expenses
also
i
have
the
honour
to
remain
your
obedient
servant
i
took
the
money
and
the
account
which
was
indicted
in
pencil
and
bowing
low
to
the
general
said
to
him
very
gravely
the
matter
can
not
end
here
i
regret
very
much
that
you
should
have
been
put
to
unpleasantness
at
the
baron
hands
but
the
fault
pardon
me
is
your
own
how
came
you
to
answer
for
me
to
the
baron
and
what
did
you
mean
by
saying
that
i
formed
part
of
your
household
i
am
merely
your
family
tutor
not
a
son
of
yours
nor
yet
your
ward
nor
a
person
of
any
kind
for
whose
acts
you
need
be
responsible
i
am
a
judicially
competent
person
a
man
of
years
of
age
a
university
graduate
a
gentleman
and
until
i
met
yourself
a
complete
stranger
to
you
only
my
boundless
respect
for
your
merits
restrains
me
from
demanding
satisfaction
at
your
hands
as
well
as
a
further
explanation
as
to
the
reasons
which
have
led
you
to
take
it
upon
yourself
to
answer
for
my
conduct
so
struck
was
he
with
my
words
that
spreading
out
his
hands
he
turned
to
the
frenchman
and
interpreted
to
him
that
i
had
challenged
himself
the
general
to
a
duel
the
frenchman
laughed
aloud
nor
do
i
intend
to
let
the
baron
off
i
continued
calmly
but
with
not
a
little
discomfiture
at
de
griers
merriment
and
since
you
general
have
today
been
so
good
as
to
listen
to
the
complaints
and
to
enter
into
his
concerns
since
you
have
made
yourself
a
participator
in
the
affair
i
have
the
honour
to
inform
you
that
tomorrow
morning
at
the
latest
i
shall
in
my
own
name
demand
of
the
said
baron
a
formal
explanation
as
to
the
reasons
which
have
led
him
to
disregard
the
fact
that
the
matter
lies
between
him
and
myself
alone
and
to
put
a
slight
upon
me
by
referring
it
to
another
person
as
though
i
were
unworthy
to
answer
for
my
own
conduct
then
there
happened
what
i
had
foreseen
the
general
on
hearing
of
this
further
intended
outrage
showed
the
white
feather
what
he
cried
do
you
intend
to
go
on
with
this
damned
nonsense
do
you
not
realise
the
harm
that
it
is
doing
me
i
beg
of
you
not
to
laugh
at
me
sir
not
to
laugh
at
me
for
we
have
police
authorities
here
who
out
of
respect
for
my
rank
and
for
that
of
the
baron
in
short
sir
i
swear
to
you
that
i
will
have
you
arrested
and
marched
out
of
the
place
to
prevent
any
further
brawling
on
your
part
do
you
understand
what
i
say
he
was
almost
breathless
with
anger
as
well
as
in
a
terrible
fright
general
i
replied
with
that
calmness
which
he
never
could
abide
one
can
not
arrest
a
man
for
brawling
until
he
has
brawled
i
have
not
so
much
as
begun
my
explanations
to
the
baron
and
you
are
altogether
ignorant
as
to
the
form
and
time
which
my
intended
procedure
is
likely
to
assume
i
wish
but
to
disabuse
the
baron
of
what
is
to
me
a
shameful
supposition
namely
that
i
am
under
the
guardianship
of
a
person
who
is
qualified
to
exercise
control
over
my
free
will
it
is
vain
for
you
to
disturb
and
alarm
yourself
for
god
sake
alexis
ivanovitch
do
put
an
end
to
this
senseless
scheme
of
yours
he
muttered
but
with
a
sudden
change
from
a
truculent
tone
to
one
of
entreaty
as
he
caught
me
by
the
hand
do
you
know
what
is
likely
to
come
of
it
merely
further
unpleasantness
you
will
agree
with
me
i
am
sure
that
at
present
i
ought
to
move
with
especial
care
yes
with
very
especial
care
you
can
not
be
fully
aware
of
how
i
am
situated
when
we
leave
this
place
i
shall
be
ready
to
receive
you
back
into
my
household
but
for
the
time
being
i
well
i
can
not
tell
you
all
my
reasons
with
that
he
wound
up
in
a
despairing
voice
o
alexis
ivanovitch
alexis
ivanovitch
i
moved
towards
the
door
begging
him
to
be
calm
and
promising
that
everything
should
be
done
decently
and
in
order
whereafter
i
departed
russians
when
abroad
are
to
play
the
poltroon
to
watch
all
their
words
and
to
wonder
what
people
are
thinking
of
their
conduct
or
whether
such
and
such
a
thing
is
il
faut
in
short
they
are
to
cosset
themselves
and
to
lay
claim
to
great
importance
always
they
prefer
the
form
of
behaviour
which
has
once
and
for
all
become
accepted
and
established
this
they
will
follow
slavishly
whether
in
hotels
on
promenades
at
meetings
or
when
on
a
journey
but
the
general
had
avowed
to
me
that
over
and
above
such
considerations
as
these
there
were
circumstances
which
compelled
him
to
move
with
especial
care
at
present
and
that
the
fact
had
actually
made
him
and
a
coward
it
had
made
him
altogether
change
his
tone
towards
me
this
fact
i
took
into
my
calculations
and
duly
noted
it
for
of
course
he
might
apply
to
the
authorities
tomorrow
and
it
behoved
me
to
go
carefully
yet
it
was
not
the
general
but
polina
that
i
wanted
to
anger
she
had
treated
me
with
such
cruelty
and
had
got
me
into
such
a
hole
that
i
felt
a
longing
to
force
her
to
beseech
me
to
stop
of
course
my
tomfoolery
might
compromise
her
yet
certain
other
feelings
and
desires
had
begun
to
form
themselves
in
my
brain
if
i
was
never
to
rank
in
her
eyes
as
anything
but
a
nonentity
it
would
not
greatly
matter
if
i
figured
as
a
cockerel
and
the
baron
were
to
give
me
a
good
thrashing
but
the
fact
was
that
i
desired
to
have
the
laugh
of
them
all
and
to
come
out
myself
unscathed
let
people
see
what
they
would
see
let
polina
for
once
have
a
good
fright
and
be
forced
to
whistle
me
to
heel
again
but
however
much
she
might
whistle
she
should
see
that
i
was
at
least
no
cockerel
i
have
just
received
a
surprising
piece
of
news
i
have
just
met
our
chambermaid
on
the
stairs
and
been
informed
by
her
that
maria
philipovna
departed
today
by
the
night
train
to
stay
with
a
cousin
at
carlsbad
what
can
that
mean
the
maid
declares
that
madame
packed
her
trunks
early
in
the
day
yet
how
is
it
that
no
one
else
seems
to
have
been
aware
of
the
circumstance
or
is
it
that
i
have
been
the
only
person
to
be
unaware
of
it
also
the
maid
has
just
told
me
that
three
days
ago
maria
philipovna
had
some
high
words
with
the
general
i
understand
then
probably
the
words
were
concerning
mlle
blanche
certainly
something
decisive
is
approaching
vii
in
the
morning
i
sent
for
the
maitre
and
explained
to
him
that
in
future
my
bill
was
to
be
rendered
to
me
personally
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
expenses
had
never
been
so
large
as
to
alarm
me
nor
to
lead
me
to
quit
the
hotel
while
moreover
i
still
had
gulden
left
to
me
and
in
them
yes
in
them
perhaps
riches
awaited
me
it
was
a
curious
fact
that
though
i
had
not
yet
won
anything
at
play
i
nevertheless
acted
thought
and
felt
as
though
i
were
sure
before
long
to
become
wealthy
since
i
could
not
imagine
myself
otherwise
next
i
bethought
me
despite
the
earliness
of
the
hour
of
going
to
see
astley
who
was
staying
at
the
hotel
de
a
hostelry
at
no
great
distance
from
our
own
but
suddenly
de
griers
entered
my
room
this
had
never
before
happened
for
of
late
that
gentleman
and
i
had
stood
on
the
most
strained
and
distant
of
terms
he
attempting
no
concealment
of
his
contempt
for
me
he
even
made
an
express
point
of
showing
it
and
i
having
no
reason
to
desire
his
company
in
short
i
detested
him
consequently
his
entry
at
the
present
moment
the
more
astounded
me
at
once
i
divined
that
something
out
of
the
way
was
on
the
carpet
he
entered
with
marked
affability
and
began
by
complimenting
me
on
my
room
then
perceiving
that
i
had
my
hat
in
my
hands
he
inquired
whither
i
was
going
so
early
and
no
sooner
did
he
hear
that
i
was
bound
for
astley
than
he
stopped
looked
grave
and
seemed
plunged
in
thought
he
was
a
true
frenchman
insofar
as
that
though
he
could
be
lively
and
engaging
when
it
suited
him
he
became
insufferably
dull
and
wearisome
as
soon
as
ever
the
need
for
being
lively
and
engaging
had
passed
seldom
is
a
frenchman
naturally
civil
he
is
civil
only
as
though
to
order
and
of
set
purpose
also
if
he
thinks
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
be
fanciful
original
and
out
of
the
way
his
fancy
always
assumes
a
foolish
unnatural
vein
for
the
reason
that
it
is
compounded
of
trite
hackneyed
forms
in
short
the
natural
frenchman
is
a
conglomeration
of
commonplace
petty
everyday
positiveness
so
that
he
is
the
most
tedious
person
in
the
indeed
i
believe
that
none
but
greenhorns
and
excessively
russian
people
feel
an
attraction
towards
the
french
for
to
any
man
of
sensibility
such
a
compendium
of
outworn
forms
a
compendium
which
is
built
up
of
manners
expansiveness
and
gaiety
becomes
at
once
and
unbearable
i
have
come
to
see
you
on
business
de
griers
began
in
a
very
yet
polite
tone
nor
will
i
seek
to
conceal
from
you
the
fact
that
i
have
come
in
the
capacity
of
an
emissary
of
an
intermediary
from
the
general
having
small
knowledge
of
the
russian
tongue
i
lost
most
of
what
was
said
last
night
but
the
general
has
now
explained
matters
and
i
must
confess
that
see
here
monsieur
de
griers
i
interrupted
i
understand
that
you
have
undertaken
to
act
in
this
affair
as
an
intermediary
of
course
i
am
only
utchitel
a
tutor
and
have
never
claimed
to
be
an
intimate
of
this
household
nor
to
stand
on
at
all
familiar
terms
with
it
consequently
i
do
not
know
the
whole
of
its
circumstances
yet
pray
explain
to
me
this
have
you
yourself
become
one
of
its
members
seeing
that
you
are
beginning
to
take
such
a
part
in
everything
and
are
now
present
as
an
intermediary
the
frenchman
seemed
not
at
my
question
it
was
one
which
was
too
outspoken
for
his
taste
and
he
had
no
mind
to
be
frank
with
me
i
am
connected
with
the
general
he
said
drily
partly
through
business
affairs
and
partly
through
special
circumstances
my
principal
has
sent
me
merely
to
ask
you
to
forego
your
intentions
of
last
evening
what
you
contemplate
is
i
have
no
doubt
very
clever
yet
he
has
charged
me
to
represent
to
you
that
you
have
not
the
slightest
chance
of
succeeding
in
your
end
since
not
only
will
the
baron
refuse
to
receive
you
but
also
he
the
baron
has
at
his
disposal
every
possible
means
for
obviating
further
unpleasantness
from
you
surely
you
can
see
that
yourself
what
then
would
be
the
good
of
going
on
with
it
all
on
the
other
hand
the
general
promises
that
at
the
first
favourable
opportunity
he
will
receive
you
back
into
his
household
and
in
the
meantime
will
credit
you
with
your
salary
with
appointements
surely
that
will
suit
you
will
it
not
very
quietly
i
replied
that
he
the
frenchman
was
labouring
under
a
delusion
that
perhaps
after
all
i
should
not
be
expelled
from
the
baron
presence
but
on
the
contrary
be
listened
to
finally
that
i
should
be
glad
if
monsieur
de
griers
would
confess
that
he
was
now
visiting
me
merely
in
order
to
see
how
far
i
intended
to
go
in
the
affair
good
heavens
cried
de
griers
seeing
that
the
general
takes
such
an
interest
in
the
matter
is
there
anything
very
unnatural
in
his
desiring
also
to
know
your
plans
again
i
began
my
explanations
but
the
frenchman
only
fidgeted
and
rolled
his
head
about
as
he
listened
with
an
expression
of
manifest
and
unconcealed
irony
on
his
face
in
short
he
adopted
a
supercilious
attitude
for
my
own
part
i
endeavoured
to
pretend
that
i
took
the
affair
very
seriously
i
declared
that
since
the
baron
had
gone
and
complained
of
me
to
the
general
as
though
i
were
a
mere
servant
of
the
general
he
had
in
the
first
place
lost
me
my
post
and
in
the
second
place
treated
me
like
a
person
to
whom
as
to
one
not
qualified
to
answer
for
himself
it
was
not
even
worth
while
to
speak
naturally
i
said
i
felt
insulted
at
this
yet
comprehending
as
i
did
differences
of
years
of
social
status
and
so
forth
here
i
could
scarcely
help
smiling
i
was
not
anxious
to
bring
about
further
scenes
by
going
personally
to
demand
or
to
request
satisfaction
of
the
baron
all
that
i
felt
was
that
i
had
a
right
to
go
in
person
and
beg
the
baron
and
the
baroness
pardon
the
more
so
since
of
late
i
had
been
feeling
unwell
and
unstrung
and
had
been
in
a
fanciful
condition
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
yet
i
continued
the
baron
offensive
behaviour
to
me
of
yesterday
that
is
to
say
the
fact
of
his
referring
the
matter
to
the
general
as
well
as
his
insistence
that
the
general
should
deprive
me
of
my
post
had
placed
me
in
such
a
position
that
i
could
not
well
express
my
regret
to
him
the
baron
and
to
his
good
lady
for
the
reason
that
in
all
probability
both
he
and
the
baroness
with
the
world
at
large
would
imagine
that
i
was
doing
so
merely
because
i
hoped
by
my
action
to
recover
my
post
hence
i
found
myself
forced
to
request
the
baron
to
express
to
me
his
own
regrets
as
well
as
to
express
them
in
the
most
unqualified
manner
to
say
in
fact
that
he
had
never
had
any
wish
to
insult
me
after
the
baron
had
done
that
i
should
for
my
part
at
once
feel
free
to
express
to
him
and
without
reserve
my
own
regrets
in
short
i
declared
in
conclusion
my
one
desire
is
that
the
baron
may
make
it
possible
for
me
to
adopt
the
latter
course
oh
fie
what
refinements
and
subtleties
exclaimed
de
griers
besides
what
have
you
to
express
regret
for
confess
monsieur
monsieur
pardon
me
but
i
have
forgotten
your
name
confess
i
say
that
all
this
is
merely
a
plan
to
annoy
the
general
or
perhaps
you
have
some
other
and
special
end
in
view
eh
in
return
you
must
pardon
me
mon
cher
marquis
and
tell
me
what
you
have
to
do
with
it
the
general
but
what
of
the
general
last
night
he
said
that
for
some
reason
or
another
it
behoved
him
to
with
especial
care
at
present
wherefore
he
was
feeling
nervous
but
i
did
not
understand
the
reference
yes
there
do
exist
special
reasons
for
his
doing
so
assented
de
griers
in
a
conciliatory
tone
yet
with
rising
anger
you
are
acquainted
with
mlle
de
cominges
are
you
not
mlle
blanche
you
mean
yes
mlle
blanche
de
cominges
doubtless
you
know
also
that
the
general
is
in
love
with
this
young
lady
and
may
even
be
about
to
marry
her
before
he
leaves
here
imagine
therefore
what
any
scene
or
scandal
would
entail
upon
him
i
can
not
see
that
the
marriage
scheme
need
be
affected
by
scenes
or
scandals
mais
le
baron
est
si
irascible
un
caractere
prussien
vous
savez
enfin
il
fera
une
querelle
i
do
not
care
i
replied
seeing
that
i
no
longer
belong
to
his
household
of
set
purpose
i
was
trying
to
talk
as
senselessly
as
possible
but
is
it
quite
settled
that
mlle
is
to
marry
the
general
what
are
they
waiting
for
why
should
they
conceal
such
a
matter
at
all
events
from
ourselves
the
general
own
party
i
can
not
tell
you
the
marriage
is
not
yet
a
settled
affair
for
they
are
awaiting
news
from
russia
the
general
has
business
transactions
to
arrange
ah
connected
doubtless
with
madame
his
mother
de
griers
shot
at
me
a
glance
of
hatred
to
cut
things
short
he
interrupted
i
have
complete
confidence
in
your
native
politeness
as
well
as
in
your
tact
and
good
sense
i
feel
sure
that
you
will
do
what
i
suggest
even
if
it
is
only
for
the
sake
of
this
family
which
has
received
you
as
a
kinsman
into
its
bosom
and
has
always
loved
and
respected
you
be
so
good
as
to
observe
i
remarked
that
the
same
family
has
just
expelled
me
from
its
bosom
all
that
you
are
saying
you
are
saying
but
for
show
but
when
people
have
just
said
to
you
course
we
do
not
wish
to
turn
you
out
yet
for
the
sake
of
appearance
you
must
permit
yourself
to
be
turned
out
nothing
can
matter
very
much
very
well
then
he
said
in
a
sterner
and
more
arrogant
tone
seeing
that
my
solicitations
have
had
no
effect
upon
you
it
is
my
duty
to
mention
that
other
measures
will
be
taken
there
exist
here
police
you
must
remember
and
this
very
day
they
shall
send
you
packing
que
diable
to
think
of
a
blanc
bec
like
yourself
challenging
a
person
like
the
baron
to
a
duel
do
you
suppose
that
you
will
be
allowed
to
do
such
things
just
try
doing
them
and
see
if
any
one
will
be
afraid
of
you
the
reason
why
i
have
asked
you
to
desist
is
that
i
can
see
that
your
conduct
is
causing
the
general
annoyance
do
you
believe
that
the
baron
could
not
tell
his
lacquey
simply
to
put
you
out
of
doors
nevertheless
i
should
not
go
out
of
doors
i
retorted
with
absolute
calm
you
are
labouring
under
a
delusion
monsieur
de
griers
the
thing
will
be
done
in
far
better
trim
than
you
imagine
i
was
just
about
to
start
for
astley
to
ask
him
to
be
my
intermediary
in
other
words
my
second
he
has
a
strong
liking
for
me
and
i
do
not
think
that
he
will
refuse
he
will
go
and
see
the
baron
on
my
behalf
and
the
baron
will
certainly
not
decline
to
receive
him
although
i
am
only
a
tutor
a
kind
of
subaltern
astley
is
known
to
all
men
as
the
nephew
of
a
real
english
lord
the
lord
piebroch
as
well
as
a
lord
in
his
own
right
yes
you
may
be
pretty
sure
that
the
baron
will
be
civil
to
astley
and
listen
to
him
or
should
he
decline
to
do
so
astley
will
take
the
refusal
as
a
personal
affront
to
himself
for
you
know
how
persistent
the
english
are
and
thereupon
introduce
to
the
baron
a
friend
of
his
own
and
he
has
many
friends
in
a
good
position
that
being
so
picture
to
yourself
the
issue
of
the
affair
an
affair
which
will
not
quite
end
as
you
think
it
will
this
caused
the
frenchman
to
bethink
him
of
playing
the
coward
really
things
may
be
as
this
fellow
says
he
evidently
thought
really
he
might
be
able
to
engineer
another
scene
once
more
i
beg
of
you
to
let
the
matter
drop
he
continued
in
a
tone
that
was
now
entirely
conciliatory
one
would
think
that
it
actually
pleased
you
to
have
scenes
indeed
it
is
a
brawl
rather
than
genuine
satisfaction
that
you
are
seeking
i
have
said
that
the
affair
may
prove
to
be
diverting
and
even
clever
and
that
possibly
you
may
attain
something
by
it
yet
none
the
less
i
tell
you
he
said
this
only
because
he
saw
me
rise
and
reach
for
my
hat
that
i
have
come
hither
also
to
hand
you
these
few
words
from
a
certain
person
read
them
please
for
i
must
take
her
back
an
answer
so
saying
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
small
compact
note
and
handed
it
to
me
in
polina
handwriting
i
read
i
hear
that
you
are
thinking
of
going
on
with
this
affair
you
have
lost
your
temper
now
and
are
beginning
to
play
the
fool
certain
circumstances
however
i
may
explain
to
you
later
pray
cease
from
your
folly
and
put
a
check
upon
yourself
for
folly
it
all
is
i
have
need
of
you
and
moreover
you
have
promised
to
obey
me
remember
the
shlangenberg
i
ask
you
to
be
obedient
if
necessary
i
shall
even
bid
you
be
your
own
polina
if
so
be
that
you
still
bear
a
grudge
against
me
for
what
happened
last
night
pray
forgive
me
everything
to
my
eyes
seemed
to
change
as
i
read
these
words
my
lips
grew
pale
and
i
began
to
tremble
meanwhile
the
cursed
frenchman
was
eyeing
me
discreetly
and
askance
as
though
he
wished
to
avoid
witnessing
my
confusion
it
would
have
been
better
if
he
had
laughed
outright
very
well
i
said
you
can
tell
mlle
not
to
disturb
herself
but
i
added
sharply
i
would
also
ask
you
why
you
have
been
so
long
in
handing
me
this
note
instead
of
chattering
about
trifles
you
ought
to
have
delivered
me
the
missive
at
once
if
you
have
really
come
commissioned
as
you
say
well
pardon
some
natural
haste
on
my
part
for
the
situation
is
so
strange
i
wished
first
to
gain
some
personal
knowledge
of
your
intentions
and
moreover
i
did
not
know
the
contents
of
the
note
and
thought
that
it
could
be
given
you
at
any
time
i
understand
i
replied
so
you
were
ordered
to
hand
me
the
note
only
in
the
last
resort
and
if
you
could
not
otherwise
appease
me
is
it
not
so
speak
out
monsieur
de
griers
perhaps
said
he
assuming
a
look
of
great
forbearance
but
gazing
at
me
in
a
meaning
way
i
reached
for
my
hat
whereupon
he
nodded
and
went
out
yet
on
his
lips
i
fancied
that
i
could
see
a
mocking
smile
how
could
it
have
been
otherwise
you
and
i
are
to
have
a
reckoning
later
master
frenchman
i
muttered
as
i
descended
the
stairs
yes
we
will
measure
our
strength
together
yet
my
thoughts
were
all
in
confusion
for
again
something
seemed
to
have
struck
me
dizzy
presently
the
air
revived
me
a
little
and
a
couple
of
minutes
later
my
brain
had
sufficiently
cleared
to
enable
two
ideas
in
particular
to
stand
out
in
it
firstly
i
asked
myself
which
of
the
absurd
boyish
and
extravagant
threats
which
i
had
uttered
at
random
last
night
had
made
everybody
so
alarmed
secondly
what
was
the
influence
which
this
frenchman
appeared
to
exercise
over
polina
he
had
but
to
give
the
word
and
at
once
she
did
as
he
desired
at
once
she
wrote
me
a
note
to
beg
of
me
to
forbear
of
course
the
relations
between
the
pair
had
from
the
first
been
a
riddle
to
me
they
had
been
so
ever
since
i
had
first
made
their
acquaintance
but
of
late
i
had
remarked
in
her
a
strong
aversion
for
even
a
contempt
for
him
while
for
his
part
he
had
scarcely
even
looked
at
her
but
had
behaved
towards
her
always
in
the
most
churlish
fashion
yes
i
had
noted
that
also
polina
herself
had
mentioned
to
me
her
dislike
for
him
and
delivered
herself
of
some
remarkable
confessions
on
the
subject
hence
he
must
have
got
her
into
his
power
somehow
somehow
he
must
be
holding
her
as
in
a
vice
viii
all
at
once
on
the
promenade
as
it
was
called
that
is
to
say
in
the
chestnut
avenue
i
came
face
to
face
with
my
englishman
i
was
just
coming
to
see
you
he
said
and
you
appear
to
be
out
on
a
similar
errand
so
you
have
parted
with
your
employers
how
do
you
know
that
i
asked
in
astonishment
is
every
one
aware
of
the
fact
by
no
means
not
every
one
would
consider
such
a
fact
to
be
of
moment
indeed
i
have
never
heard
any
one
speak
of
it
then
how
come
you
to
know
it
because
i
have
had
occasion
to
do
so
whither
are
you
bound
i
like
you
and
was
therefore
coming
to
pay
you
a
visit
what
a
splendid
fellow
you
are
mr
astley
i
cried
though
still
wondering
how
he
had
come
by
his
knowledge
and
since
i
have
not
yet
had
my
coffee
and
you
have
in
all
probability
scarcely
tasted
yours
let
us
adjourn
to
the
casino
cafe
where
we
can
sit
and
smoke
and
have
a
talk
the
cafe
in
question
was
only
a
hundred
paces
away
so
when
coffee
had
been
brought
we
seated
ourselves
and
i
lit
a
cigarette
astley
was
no
smoker
but
taking
a
seat
by
my
side
he
prepared
himself
to
listen
i
do
not
intend
to
go
away
was
my
first
remark
i
intend
on
the
contrary
to
remain
here
that
i
never
doubted
he
answered
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
on
my
way
to
see
him
i
had
never
even
thought
of
telling
him
of
my
love
for
polina
in
fact
i
had
purposely
meant
to
avoid
any
mention
of
the
subject
nor
during
our
stay
in
the
place
had
i
ever
made
aught
but
the
scantiest
reference
to
it
you
see
not
only
was
astley
a
man
of
great
reserve
but
also
from
the
first
i
had
perceived
that
polina
had
made
a
great
impression
upon
him
although
he
never
spoke
of
her
but
now
strangely
enough
he
had
no
sooner
seated
himself
and
bent
his
steely
gaze
upon
me
than
for
some
reason
or
another
i
felt
moved
to
tell
him
everything
to
speak
to
him
of
my
love
in
all
its
phases
for
an
hour
and
a
half
did
i
discourse
on
the
subject
and
found
it
a
pleasure
to
do
so
even
though
this
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
i
had
referred
to
the
matter
indeed
when
at
certain
moments
i
perceived
that
my
more
ardent
passages
confused
him
i
purposely
increased
my
ardour
of
narration
yet
one
thing
i
regret
and
that
is
that
i
made
references
to
the
frenchman
which
were
a
little
astley
sat
without
moving
as
he
listened
to
me
not
a
word
nor
a
sound
of
any
kind
did
he
utter
as
he
stared
into
my
eyes
suddenly
however
on
my
mentioning
the
frenchman
he
interrupted
me
and
inquired
sternly
whether
i
did
right
to
speak
of
an
extraneous
matter
he
had
always
been
a
strange
man
in
his
mode
of
propounding
questions
no
i
fear
not
i
replied
and
concerning
this
marquis
and
mlle
polina
you
know
nothing
beyond
surmise
again
i
was
surprised
that
such
a
categorical
question
should
come
from
such
a
reserved
individual
no
i
know
nothing
for
certain
about
them
was
my
reply
no
nothing
then
you
have
done
very
wrong
to
speak
of
them
to
me
or
even
to
imagine
things
about
them
quite
so
quite
so
i
interrupted
in
some
astonishment
i
admit
that
yet
that
is
not
the
question
whereupon
i
related
to
him
in
detail
the
incident
of
two
days
ago
i
spoke
of
polina
outburst
of
my
encounter
with
the
baron
of
my
dismissal
of
the
extraordinary
pusillanimity
and
of
the
call
which
de
griers
had
that
morning
paid
me
in
conclusion
i
showed
astley
the
note
which
i
had
lately
received
what
do
you
make
of
it
i
asked
when
i
met
you
i
was
just
coming
to
ask
you
your
opinion
for
myself
i
could
have
killed
this
frenchman
and
am
not
sure
that
i
shall
not
do
so
even
yet
i
feel
the
same
about
it
said
astley
as
for
mlle
polina
well
you
yourself
know
that
if
necessity
drives
one
enters
into
relation
with
people
whom
one
simply
detests
even
between
this
couple
there
may
be
something
which
though
unknown
to
you
depends
upon
extraneous
circumstances
for
my
own
part
i
think
that
you
may
reassure
yourself
or
at
all
events
partially
and
as
for
mlle
polina
proceedings
of
two
days
ago
they
were
of
course
strange
not
because
she
can
have
meant
to
get
rid
of
you
or
to
earn
for
you
a
thrashing
from
the
baron
cudgel
which
for
some
curious
reason
he
did
not
use
although
he
had
it
ready
in
his
hands
but
because
such
proceedings
on
the
part
of
such
well
of
such
a
refined
lady
as
mlle
polina
are
to
say
the
least
of
it
unbecoming
but
she
can
not
have
guessed
that
you
would
carry
out
her
absurd
wish
to
the
letter
do
you
know
what
suddenly
i
cried
as
i
fixed
astley
with
my
gaze
i
believe
that
you
have
already
heard
the
story
from
some
one
very
possibly
from
mlle
polina
herself
in
return
he
gave
me
an
astonished
stare
your
eyes
look
very
fiery
he
said
with
a
return
of
his
former
calm
and
in
them
i
can
read
suspicion
now
you
have
no
right
whatever
to
be
suspicious
it
is
not
a
right
which
i
can
for
a
moment
recognise
and
i
absolutely
refuse
to
answer
your
questions
enough
you
need
say
no
more
i
cried
with
a
strange
emotion
at
my
heart
yet
not
altogether
understanding
what
had
aroused
that
emotion
in
my
breast
indeed
when
where
and
how
could
polina
have
chosen
astley
to
be
one
of
her
confidants
of
late
i
had
come
rather
to
overlook
him
in
this
connection
even
though
polina
had
always
been
a
riddle
to
me
so
much
so
that
now
when
i
had
just
permitted
myself
to
tell
my
friend
of
my
infatuation
in
all
its
aspects
i
had
found
myself
struck
during
the
very
telling
with
the
fact
that
in
my
relations
with
her
i
could
specify
nothing
that
was
explicit
nothing
that
was
positive
on
the
contrary
my
relations
had
been
purely
fantastic
strange
and
unreal
they
had
been
unlike
anything
else
that
i
could
think
of
very
well
very
well
i
replied
with
a
warmth
equal
to
astley
own
then
i
stand
confounded
and
have
no
further
opinions
to
offer
but
you
are
a
good
fellow
and
i
am
glad
to
know
what
you
think
about
it
all
even
though
i
do
not
need
your
advice
then
after
a
pause
i
resumed
for
instance
what
reason
should
you
assign
for
the
general
taking
fright
in
this
way
why
should
my
stupid
clowning
have
led
the
world
to
elevate
it
into
a
serious
incident
even
de
griers
has
found
it
necessary
to
put
in
his
oar
and
he
only
interferes
on
the
most
important
occasions
and
to
visit
me
and
to
address
to
me
the
most
earnest
supplications
yes
he
de
griers
has
actually
been
playing
the
suppliant
to
me
and
mark
you
although
he
came
to
me
as
early
as
nine
he
had
in
his
hand
mlle
polina
note
when
i
would
ask
was
that
note
written
mlle
polina
must
have
been
aroused
from
sleep
for
the
express
purpose
of
writing
it
at
all
events
the
circumstance
shows
that
she
is
an
absolute
slave
to
the
frenchman
since
she
actually
begs
my
pardon
in
the
note
actually
begs
my
pardon
yet
what
is
her
personal
concern
in
the
matter
why
is
she
interested
in
it
at
all
why
too
is
the
whole
party
so
afraid
of
this
precious
baron
and
what
sort
of
a
business
do
you
call
it
for
the
general
to
be
going
to
marry
mlle
blanche
de
cominges
he
told
me
last
night
that
because
of
the
circumstance
he
must
with
especial
care
at
present
what
is
your
opinion
of
it
all
your
look
convinces
me
that
you
know
more
about
it
than
i
do
astley
smiled
and
nodded
yes
i
think
i
do
know
more
about
it
than
you
do
he
assented
the
affair
centres
around
this
mlle
blanche
of
that
i
feel
certain
and
what
of
mlle
blanche
i
cried
impatiently
for
in
me
there
had
dawned
a
sudden
hope
that
this
would
enable
me
to
discover
something
about
polina
well
my
belief
is
that
at
the
present
moment
mlle
blanche
has
in
very
truth
a
special
reason
for
wishing
to
avoid
any
trouble
with
the
baron
and
the
baroness
it
might
lead
not
only
to
some
unpleasantness
but
even
to
a
scandal
oh
oh
also
i
may
tell
you
that
mlle
blanche
has
been
in
roulettenberg
before
for
she
was
staying
here
three
seasons
ago
i
myself
was
in
the
place
at
the
time
and
in
those
days
mlle
blanche
was
not
known
as
mlle
de
cominges
nor
was
her
mother
the
widow
de
cominges
even
in
existence
in
any
case
no
one
ever
mentioned
the
latter
de
griers
too
had
not
materialised
and
i
am
convinced
that
not
only
do
the
parties
stand
in
no
relation
to
one
another
but
also
they
have
not
long
enjoyed
one
another
acquaintance
likewise
the
marquisate
de
griers
is
of
recent
creation
of
that
i
have
reason
to
be
sure
owing
to
a
certain
circumstance
even
the
name
de
griers
itself
may
be
taken
to
be
a
new
invention
seeing
that
i
have
a
friend
who
once
met
the
said
under
a
different
name
altogether
yet
he
possesses
a
good
circle
of
friends
possibly
mlle
blanche
also
may
possess
that
yet
it
is
not
three
years
since
she
received
from
the
local
police
at
the
instance
of
the
baroness
an
invitation
to
leave
the
town
and
she
left
it
but
why
well
i
must
tell
you
that
she
first
appeared
here
in
company
with
an
italian
a
prince
of
some
sort
a
man
who
bore
an
historic
name
barberini
or
something
of
the
kind
the
fellow
was
simply
a
mass
of
rings
and
diamonds
real
diamonds
too
and
the
couple
used
to
drive
out
in
a
marvellous
carriage
at
first
mlle
blanche
played
et
quarante
with
fair
success
but
later
her
luck
took
a
marked
change
for
the
worse
i
distinctly
remember
that
in
a
single
evening
she
lost
an
enormous
sum
but
worse
was
to
ensue
for
one
fine
morning
her
prince
disappeared
horses
carriage
and
all
also
the
hotel
bill
which
he
left
unpaid
was
enormous
upon
this
mlle
zelma
the
name
which
she
assumed
after
figuring
as
madame
barberini
was
in
despair
she
shrieked
and
howled
all
over
the
hotel
and
even
tore
her
clothes
in
her
frenzy
in
the
hotel
there
was
staying
also
a
polish
count
you
must
know
that
all
travelling
poles
are
counts
and
the
spectacle
of
mlle
zelma
tearing
her
clothes
and
catlike
scratching
her
face
with
her
beautiful
scented
nails
produced
upon
him
a
strong
impression
so
the
pair
had
a
talk
together
and
by
luncheon
time
she
was
consoled
indeed
that
evening
the
couple
entered
the
casino
mlle
zelma
laughing
loudly
according
to
her
custom
and
showing
even
more
expansiveness
in
her
manners
than
she
had
before
shown
for
instance
she
thrust
her
way
into
the
file
of
women
in
the
exact
fashion
of
those
ladies
who
to
clear
a
space
for
themselves
at
the
tables
push
their
roughly
aside
doubtless
you
have
noticed
them
yes
certainly
well
they
are
not
worth
noticing
to
the
annoyance
of
the
decent
public
they
are
allowed
to
remain
here
at
all
events
such
of
them
as
daily
change
franc
notes
at
the
tables
though
as
soon
as
ever
these
women
cease
to
do
so
they
receive
an
invitation
to
depart
however
mlle
zelma
continued
to
change
notes
of
this
kind
but
her
play
grew
more
and
more
unsuccessful
despite
the
fact
that
such
ladies
luck
is
frequently
good
for
they
have
a
surprising
amount
of
cash
at
their
disposal
suddenly
the
count
too
disappeared
even
as
the
prince
had
done
and
that
same
evening
mlle
zelma
was
forced
to
appear
in
the
casino
alone
on
this
occasion
no
one
offered
her
a
greeting
two
days
later
she
had
come
to
the
end
of
her
resources
whereupon
after
staking
and
losing
her
last
louis
she
chanced
to
look
around
her
and
saw
standing
by
her
side
the
baron
burmergelm
who
had
been
eyeing
her
with
fixed
disapproval
to
his
distaste
however
mlle
paid
no
attention
but
turning
to
him
with
her
smile
requested
him
to
stake
on
her
behalf
ten
louis
on
the
red
later
that
evening
a
complaint
from
the
baroness
led
the
authorities
to
request
mlle
not
to
the
casino
if
you
feel
in
any
way
surprised
that
i
should
know
these
petty
and
unedifying
details
the
reason
is
that
i
had
them
from
a
relative
of
mine
who
later
that
evening
drove
mlle
zelma
in
his
carriage
from
roulettenberg
to
spa
now
mark
you
mlle
wants
to
become
madame
general
in
order
that
in
future
she
may
be
spared
the
receipt
of
such
invitations
from
casino
authorities
as
she
received
three
years
ago
at
present
she
is
not
playing
but
that
is
only
because
according
to
the
signs
she
is
lending
money
to
other
players
yes
that
is
a
much
more
paying
game
i
even
suspect
that
the
unfortunate
general
is
himself
in
her
debt
as
well
as
perhaps
also
de
griers
or
it
may
be
that
the
latter
has
entered
into
a
partnership
with
her
consequently
you
yourself
will
see
that
until
the
marriage
shall
have
been
consummated
mlle
would
scarcely
like
to
have
the
attention
of
the
baron
and
the
baroness
drawn
to
herself
in
short
to
any
one
in
her
position
a
scandal
would
be
most
detrimental
you
form
a
member
of
the
menage
of
these
people
wherefore
any
act
of
yours
might
cause
such
a
scandal
and
the
more
so
since
daily
she
appears
in
public
arm
in
arm
with
the
general
or
with
mlle
polina
now
do
you
understand
no
i
do
not
i
shouted
as
i
banged
my
fist
down
upon
the
table
banged
it
with
such
violence
that
a
frightened
waiter
came
running
towards
us
tell
me
astley
why
if
you
knew
this
history
all
along
and
consequently
always
knew
who
this
mlle
blanche
is
you
never
warned
either
myself
or
the
general
nor
most
of
all
mlle
polina
who
is
accustomed
to
appear
in
the
casino
in
public
everywhere
with
mlle
blanche
how
could
you
do
it
it
would
have
done
no
good
to
warn
you
he
replied
quietly
for
the
reason
that
you
could
have
effected
nothing
against
what
was
i
to
warn
you
as
likely
as
not
the
general
knows
more
about
mlle
blanche
even
than
i
do
yet
the
unhappy
man
still
walks
about
with
her
and
mlle
polina
only
yesterday
i
saw
this
frenchwoman
riding
splendidly
mounted
with
de
griers
while
the
general
was
careering
in
their
wake
on
a
roan
horse
he
had
said
that
morning
that
his
legs
were
hurting
him
yet
his
was
easy
enough
as
he
passed
i
looked
at
him
and
the
thought
occurred
to
me
that
he
was
a
man
lost
for
ever
however
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
for
i
have
only
recently
had
the
happiness
to
make
mlle
polina
acquaintance
also
he
added
this
as
an
afterthought
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
do
not
recognise
your
right
to
ask
me
certain
questions
however
sincere
be
my
liking
for
you
enough
i
said
rising
to
me
it
is
as
clear
as
day
that
mlle
polina
knows
all
about
this
mlle
blanche
but
can
not
bring
herself
to
part
with
her
frenchman
wherefore
she
consents
also
to
be
seen
in
public
with
mlle
blanche
you
may
be
sure
that
nothing
else
would
ever
have
induced
her
either
to
walk
about
with
this
frenchwoman
or
to
send
me
a
note
not
to
touch
the
baron
yes
it
is
there
that
the
influence
lies
before
which
everything
in
the
world
must
bow
yet
she
herself
it
was
who
launched
me
at
the
baron
the
devil
take
it
but
i
was
left
no
choice
in
the
matter
you
forget
in
the
first
place
that
this
mlle
de
cominges
is
the
general
inamorata
and
in
the
second
place
that
mlle
polina
the
general
has
a
younger
brother
and
sister
who
though
they
are
the
general
own
children
are
completely
neglected
by
this
madman
and
robbed
as
well
yes
yes
that
is
so
for
me
to
go
and
desert
the
children
now
would
mean
their
total
abandonment
whereas
if
i
remain
i
should
be
able
to
defend
their
interests
and
perhaps
to
save
a
moiety
of
their
property
yes
yes
that
is
quite
true
and
yet
and
yet
oh
i
can
well
understand
why
they
are
all
so
interested
in
the
general
mother
in
whom
asked
astley
in
the
old
woman
of
moscow
who
declines
to
die
yet
concerning
whom
they
are
for
ever
expecting
telegrams
to
notify
the
fact
of
her
death
ah
then
of
course
their
interests
centre
around
her
it
is
a
question
of
succession
let
that
but
be
settled
and
the
general
will
marry
mlle
polina
will
be
set
free
and
de
griers
yes
and
de
griers
will
be
repaid
his
money
which
is
what
he
is
now
waiting
for
what
you
think
that
he
is
waiting
for
that
i
know
of
nothing
else
asserted
astley
doggedly
but
i
do
i
do
i
shouted
in
my
fury
he
is
waiting
also
for
the
old
woman
will
for
the
reason
that
it
awards
mlle
polina
a
dowry
as
soon
as
ever
the
money
is
received
she
will
throw
herself
upon
the
frenchman
neck
all
women
are
like
that
even
the
proudest
of
them
become
abject
slaves
where
marriage
is
concerned
what
polina
is
good
for
is
to
fall
head
over
ears
in
love
that
is
my
opinion
look
at
her
especially
when
she
is
sitting
alone
and
plunged
in
thought
all
this
was
and
foretold
and
is
accursed
polina
could
perpetrate
any
mad
act
she
she
but
who
called
me
by
name
i
broke
off
who
is
shouting
for
me
i
heard
some
one
calling
in
russian
ivanovitch
it
was
a
woman
voice
listen
at
the
moment
we
were
approaching
my
hotel
we
had
left
the
cafe
long
ago
without
even
noticing
that
we
had
done
so
yes
i
did
hear
a
woman
voice
calling
but
whose
i
do
not
know
the
someone
was
calling
you
in
russian
ah
now
i
can
see
whence
the
cries
come
they
come
from
that
lady
there
the
one
who
is
sitting
on
the
settee
the
one
who
has
just
been
escorted
to
the
verandah
by
a
crowd
of
lacqueys
behind
her
see
that
pile
of
luggage
she
must
have
arrived
by
train
but
why
should
she
be
calling
me
hear
her
calling
again
see
she
is
beckoning
to
us
yes
so
she
is
assented
astley
alexis
ivanovitch
alexis
ivanovitch
good
heavens
what
a
stupid
fellow
came
in
a
despairing
wail
from
the
verandah
we
had
almost
reached
the
portico
and
i
was
just
setting
foot
upon
the
space
before
it
when
my
hands
fell
to
my
sides
in
limp
astonishment
and
my
feet
glued
themselves
to
the
pavement
ix
for
on
the
topmost
tier
of
the
hotel
verandah
after
being
carried
up
the
steps
in
an
armchair
amid
a
bevy
of
footmen
and
other
menials
of
the
hotel
headed
by
the
landlord
that
functionary
had
actually
run
out
to
meet
a
visitor
who
arrived
with
so
much
stir
and
din
attended
by
her
own
retinue
and
accompanied
by
so
great
a
pile
of
trunks
and
portmanteaux
on
the
topmost
tier
of
the
verandah
i
say
there
was
sitting
the
grandmother
yes
it
was
she
rich
and
imposing
and
years
of
age
antonida
vassilievna
tarassevitcha
landowner
and
grande
dame
of
moscow
the
la
baboulenka
who
had
caused
so
many
telegrams
to
be
sent
off
and
received
who
had
been
dying
yet
not
dying
who
had
in
her
own
person
descended
upon
us
even
as
snow
might
fall
from
the
clouds
though
unable
to
walk
she
had
arrived
borne
aloft
in
an
armchair
her
mode
of
conveyance
for
the
last
five
years
as
brisk
aggressive
loudly
imperious
and
generally
abusive
as
ever
in
fact
she
looked
exactly
as
she
had
on
the
only
two
occasions
when
i
had
seen
her
since
my
appointment
to
the
general
household
naturally
enough
i
stood
petrified
with
astonishment
she
had
sighted
me
a
hundred
paces
off
even
while
she
was
being
carried
along
in
her
chair
she
had
recognised
me
and
called
me
by
name
and
surname
which
as
usual
after
hearing
once
she
had
remembered
ever
afterwards
and
this
is
the
woman
whom
they
had
thought
to
see
in
her
grave
after
making
her
will
i
thought
to
myself
yet
she
will
outlive
us
and
every
one
else
in
the
hotel
good
lord
what
is
going
to
become
of
us
now
what
on
earth
is
to
happen
to
the
general
she
will
turn
the
place
upside
down
my
good
sir
the
old
woman
continued
in
a
stentorian
voice
what
are
you
standing
there
for
with
your
eyes
almost
falling
out
of
your
head
can
not
you
come
and
say
are
you
too
proud
to
shake
hands
or
do
you
not
recognise
me
here
potapitch
she
cried
to
an
old
servant
who
dressed
in
a
frock
coat
and
white
waistcoat
had
a
bald
red
head
he
was
the
chamberlain
who
always
accompanied
her
on
her
journeys
just
think
alexis
ivanovitch
does
not
recognise
me
they
have
buried
me
for
good
and
all
yes
and
after
sending
hosts
of
telegrams
to
know
if
i
were
dead
or
not
yes
yes
i
have
heard
the
whole
story
i
am
very
much
alive
though
as
you
may
see
pardon
me
antonida
vassilievna
i
replied
good
humouredly
as
i
recovered
my
presence
of
mind
i
have
no
reason
to
wish
you
ill
i
am
merely
rather
astonished
to
see
you
why
should
i
not
be
so
seeing
how
unexpected
why
should
you
be
astonished
i
just
got
into
my
chair
and
came
things
are
quiet
enough
in
the
train
for
there
is
no
one
there
to
chatter
have
you
been
out
for
a
walk
yes
i
have
just
been
to
the
casino
oh
well
it
is
quite
nice
here
she
went
on
as
she
looked
about
her
the
place
seems
comfortable
and
all
the
trees
are
out
i
like
it
very
well
are
your
people
at
home
is
the
general
for
instance
indoors
yes
and
probably
all
of
them
do
they
observe
the
convenances
and
keep
up
appearances
such
things
always
give
one
tone
i
have
heard
that
they
are
keeping
a
carriage
even
as
russian
gentlefolks
ought
to
do
when
abroad
our
russian
people
always
cut
a
dash
is
prascovia
here
too
yes
polina
alexandrovna
is
here
and
the
frenchwoman
however
i
will
go
and
look
for
them
myself
tell
me
the
nearest
way
to
their
rooms
do
you
like
being
here
yes
i
thank
you
antonida
vassilievna
and
you
potapitch
you
go
and
tell
that
fool
of
a
landlord
to
reserve
me
a
suitable
suite
of
rooms
they
must
be
handsomely
decorated
and
not
too
high
up
have
my
luggage
taken
up
to
them
but
what
are
you
tumbling
over
yourselves
for
why
are
you
all
tearing
about
what
scullions
these
fellows
are
who
is
that
with
you
she
added
to
myself
a
astley
i
replied
and
who
is
mr
astley
a
and
my
very
good
friend
as
well
as
an
acquaintance
of
the
general
oh
an
englishman
then
that
is
why
he
stared
at
me
without
even
opening
his
lips
however
i
like
englishmen
now
take
me
upstairs
direct
to
their
rooms
where
are
they
lodging
madame
was
lifted
up
in
her
chair
by
the
lacqueys
and
i
preceded
her
up
the
grand
staircase
our
progress
was
exceedingly
effective
for
everyone
whom
we
met
stopped
to
stare
at
the
cortege
it
happened
that
the
hotel
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
best
the
most
expensive
and
the
most
aristocratic
in
all
the
spa
and
at
every
turn
on
the
staircase
or
in
the
corridors
we
encountered
fine
ladies
and
englishmen
more
than
one
of
whom
hastened
downstairs
to
inquire
of
the
awestruck
landlord
who
the
newcomer
was
to
all
such
questions
he
returned
the
same
answer
namely
that
the
old
lady
was
an
influential
foreigner
a
russian
a
countess
and
a
grande
dame
and
that
she
had
taken
the
suite
which
during
the
previous
week
had
been
tenanted
by
the
grande
duchesse
de
meanwhile
the
cause
of
the
sensation
the
grandmother
was
being
borne
aloft
in
her
armchair
every
person
whom
she
met
she
scanned
with
an
inquisitive
eye
after
first
of
all
interrogating
me
about
him
or
her
at
the
top
of
her
voice
she
was
stout
of
figure
and
though
she
could
not
leave
her
chair
one
felt
the
moment
that
one
first
looked
at
her
that
she
was
also
tall
of
stature
her
back
was
as
straight
as
a
board
and
never
did
she
lean
back
in
her
seat
also
her
large
grey
head
with
its
keen
rugged
features
remained
always
erect
as
she
glanced
about
her
in
an
imperious
challenging
sort
of
way
with
looks
and
gestures
that
clearly
were
unstudied
though
she
had
reached
her
year
her
face
was
still
fresh
and
her
teeth
had
not
decayed
lastly
she
was
dressed
in
a
black
silk
gown
and
white
mobcap
she
interests
me
tremendously
whispered
astley
as
still
smoking
he
walked
by
my
side
meanwhile
i
was
reflecting
that
probably
the
old
lady
knew
all
about
the
telegrams
and
even
about
de
griers
though
little
or
nothing
about
mlle
blanche
i
said
as
much
to
astley
but
what
a
frail
creature
is
man
no
sooner
was
my
first
surprise
abated
than
i
found
myself
rejoicing
in
the
shock
which
we
were
about
to
administer
to
the
general
so
much
did
the
thought
inspire
me
that
i
marched
ahead
in
the
gayest
of
fashions
our
party
was
lodging
on
the
third
floor
without
knocking
at
the
door
or
in
any
way
announcing
our
presence
i
threw
open
the
portals
and
the
grandmother
was
borne
through
them
in
triumph
as
though
of
set
purpose
the
whole
party
chanced
at
that
moment
to
be
assembled
in
the
general
study
the
time
was
eleven
and
it
seemed
that
an
outing
of
some
sort
at
which
a
portion
of
the
party
were
to
drive
in
carriages
and
others
to
ride
on
horseback
accompanied
by
one
or
two
extraneous
acquaintances
was
being
planned
the
general
was
present
and
also
polina
the
children
the
latter
nurses
de
griers
mlle
blanche
attired
in
a
her
mother
the
young
prince
and
a
learned
german
whom
i
beheld
for
the
first
time
into
the
midst
of
this
assembly
the
lacqueys
conveyed
madame
in
her
chair
and
set
her
down
within
three
paces
of
the
general
good
heavens
never
shall
i
forget
the
spectacle
which
ensued
just
before
our
entry
the
general
had
been
holding
forth
to
the
company
with
de
griers
in
support
of
him
i
may
also
mention
that
for
the
last
two
or
three
days
mlle
blanche
and
de
griers
had
been
making
a
great
deal
of
the
young
prince
under
the
very
nose
of
the
poor
general
in
short
the
company
though
decorous
and
conventional
was
in
a
gay
familiar
mood
but
no
sooner
did
the
grandmother
appear
than
the
general
stopped
dead
in
the
middle
of
a
word
and
with
jaw
dropping
stared
hard
at
the
old
lady
his
eyes
almost
starting
out
of
his
head
and
his
expression
as
spellbound
as
though
he
had
just
seen
a
basilisk
in
return
the
grandmother
stared
at
him
silently
and
without
moving
though
with
a
look
of
mingled
challenge
triumph
and
ridicule
in
her
eyes
for
ten
seconds
did
the
pair
remain
thus
eyeing
one
another
amid
the
profound
silence
of
the
company
and
even
de
griers
sat
petrified
an
extraordinary
look
of
uneasiness
dawning
on
his
face
as
for
mlle
blanche
she
too
stared
wildly
at
the
grandmother
with
eyebrows
raised
and
her
lips
parted
while
the
prince
and
the
german
savant
contemplated
the
tableau
in
profound
amazement
only
polina
looked
anything
but
perplexed
or
surprised
presently
however
she
too
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
then
reddened
to
her
temples
truly
the
grandmother
arrival
seemed
to
be
a
catastrophe
for
everybody
for
my
own
part
i
stood
looking
from
the
grandmother
to
the
company
and
back
again
while
astley
as
usual
remained
in
the
background
and
gazed
calmly
and
decorously
at
the
scene
well
here
i
am
and
instead
of
a
telegram
too
the
grandmother
at
last
ejaculated
to
dissipate
the
silence
what
you
were
not
expecting
me
antonida
vassilievna
o
my
dearest
mother
but
how
on
earth
did
you
did
you
the
mutterings
of
the
unhappy
general
died
away
i
verily
believe
that
if
the
grandmother
had
held
her
tongue
a
few
seconds
longer
she
would
have
had
a
stroke
how
on
earth
did
i
what
she
exclaimed
why
i
just
got
into
the
train
and
came
here
what
else
is
the
railway
meant
for
but
you
thought
that
i
had
turned
up
my
toes
and
left
my
property
to
the
lot
of
you
oh
i
know
all
about
the
telegrams
which
you
have
been
dispatching
they
must
have
cost
you
a
pretty
sum
i
should
think
for
telegrams
are
not
sent
from
abroad
for
nothing
well
i
picked
up
my
heels
and
came
here
who
is
this
frenchman
monsieur
de
griers
i
suppose
oui
madame
assented
de
griers
et
croyez
je
suis
si
enchante
votre
sante
un
miracle
vous
voir
ici
une
surprise
charmante
just
so
i
happen
to
know
you
as
a
mountebank
and
therefore
trust
you
no
more
than
this
she
indicated
her
little
finger
and
who
is
that
she
went
on
turning
towards
mlle
blanche
evidently
the
frenchwoman
looked
so
becoming
in
her
with
her
whip
in
her
hand
that
she
had
made
an
impression
upon
the
old
lady
who
is
that
woman
there
mlle
de
cominges
i
said
and
this
is
her
mother
madame
de
cominges
they
also
are
staying
in
the
hotel
is
the
daughter
married
asked
the
old
lady
without
the
least
semblance
of
ceremony
no
i
replied
as
respectfully
as
possible
but
under
my
breath
is
she
good
company
i
failed
to
understand
the
question
i
mean
is
she
or
is
she
not
a
bore
can
she
speak
russian
when
this
de
griers
was
in
moscow
he
soon
learnt
to
make
himself
understood
i
explained
to
the
old
lady
that
mlle
blanche
had
never
visited
russia
bonjour
then
said
madame
with
sudden
brusquerie
bonjour
madame
replied
mlle
blanche
with
an
elegant
ceremonious
bow
as
under
cover
of
an
unwonted
modesty
she
endeavoured
to
express
both
in
face
and
figure
her
extreme
surprise
at
such
strange
behaviour
on
the
part
of
the
grandmother
how
the
woman
sticks
out
her
eyes
at
me
how
she
mows
and
minces
was
the
grandmother
comment
then
she
turned
suddenly
to
the
general
and
continued
i
have
taken
up
my
abode
here
so
am
going
to
be
your
neighbour
are
you
glad
to
hear
that
or
are
you
not
my
dear
mother
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
am
sincerely
delighted
returned
the
general
who
had
now
to
a
certain
extent
recovered
his
senses
and
inasmuch
as
when
occasion
arose
he
could
speak
with
fluency
gravity
and
a
certain
effect
he
set
himself
to
be
expansive
in
his
remarks
and
went
on
we
have
been
so
dismayed
and
upset
by
the
news
of
your
indisposition
we
had
received
such
hopeless
telegrams
about
you
then
suddenly
fibs
fibs
interrupted
the
grandmother
how
on
earth
too
did
you
come
to
decide
upon
the
journey
continued
the
general
with
raised
voice
as
he
hurried
to
overlook
the
old
last
remark
surely
at
your
age
and
in
your
present
state
of
health
the
thing
is
so
unexpected
that
our
surprise
is
at
least
intelligible
however
i
am
glad
to
see
you
as
indeed
are
we
all
he
said
this
with
a
dignified
yet
conciliatory
smile
and
will
use
my
best
endeavours
to
render
your
stay
here
as
pleasant
as
possible
enough
all
this
is
empty
chatter
you
are
talking
the
usual
nonsense
i
shall
know
quite
well
how
to
spend
my
time
how
did
i
come
to
undertake
the
journey
you
ask
well
is
there
anything
so
very
surprising
about
it
it
was
done
quite
simply
what
is
every
one
going
into
ecstasies
about
how
do
you
do
prascovia
what
are
you
doing
here
and
how
are
you
grandmother
replied
polina
as
she
approached
the
old
lady
were
you
long
on
the
journey
the
most
sensible
question
that
i
have
yet
been
asked
well
you
shall
hear
for
yourself
how
it
all
happened
i
lay
and
lay
and
was
doctored
and
doctored
until
at
last
i
drove
the
physicians
from
me
and
called
in
an
apothecary
from
nicolai
who
had
cured
an
old
woman
of
a
malady
similar
to
my
own
cured
her
merely
with
a
little
hayseed
well
he
did
me
a
great
deal
of
good
for
on
the
third
day
i
broke
into
a
sweat
and
was
able
to
leave
my
bed
then
my
german
doctors
held
another
consultation
put
on
their
spectacles
and
told
me
that
if
i
would
go
abroad
and
take
a
course
of
the
waters
the
indisposition
would
finally
pass
away
should
it
not
i
thought
to
myself
so
i
had
got
things
ready
and
on
the
following
day
a
friday
set
out
for
here
i
occupied
a
special
compartment
in
the
train
and
where
ever
i
had
to
change
i
found
at
the
station
bearers
who
were
ready
to
carry
me
for
a
few
coppers
you
have
nice
quarters
here
she
went
on
as
she
glanced
around
the
room
but
where
on
earth
did
you
get
the
money
for
them
my
good
sir
i
thought
that
everything
of
yours
had
been
mortgaged
this
frenchman
alone
must
be
your
creditor
for
a
good
deal
oh
i
know
all
about
it
all
about
it
am
surprised
at
you
my
dearest
mother
said
the
general
in
some
confusion
am
greatly
surprised
but
i
do
not
need
any
extraneous
control
of
my
finances
moreover
my
expenses
do
not
exceed
my
income
and
we
they
do
not
exceed
it
fie
why
you
are
robbing
your
children
of
their
last
kopeck
you
their
guardian
after
this
said
the
general
completely
taken
aback
after
what
you
have
just
said
i
do
not
know
whether
you
do
not
know
what
by
heavens
are
you
never
going
to
drop
that
roulette
of
yours
are
you
going
to
whistle
all
your
property
away
this
made
such
an
impression
upon
the
general
that
he
almost
choked
with
fury
roulette
indeed
i
play
roulette
really
in
view
of
my
position
recollect
what
you
are
saying
my
dearest
mother
you
must
still
be
unwell
rubbish
rubbish
she
retorted
the
truth
is
that
you
can
not
be
got
away
from
that
roulette
you
are
simply
telling
lies
this
very
day
i
mean
to
go
and
see
for
myself
what
roulette
is
like
prascovia
tell
me
what
there
is
to
be
seen
here
and
do
you
alexis
ivanovitch
show
me
everything
and
do
you
potapitch
make
me
a
list
of
excursions
what
is
there
to
be
seen
again
she
inquired
of
polina
there
is
a
ruined
castle
and
the
shlangenberg
the
shlangenberg
what
is
it
a
forest
no
a
mountain
on
the
summit
of
which
there
is
a
place
fenced
off
from
it
you
can
get
a
most
beautiful
view
could
a
chair
be
carried
up
that
mountain
of
yours
doubtless
we
could
find
bearers
for
the
purpose
i
interposed
at
this
moment
theodosia
the
nursemaid
approached
the
old
lady
with
the
general
children
no
i
do
want
to
see
them
said
the
grandmother
i
hate
kissing
children
for
their
noses
are
always
wet
how
are
you
getting
on
theodosia
i
am
very
well
thank
you
madame
replied
the
nursemaid
and
how
is
your
ladyship
we
have
been
feeling
so
anxious
about
you
yes
i
know
you
simple
soul
but
who
are
those
other
guests
the
old
lady
continued
turning
again
to
polina
for
instance
who
is
that
old
rascal
in
the
spectacles
prince
nilski
grandmamma
whispered
polina
oh
a
russian
why
i
had
no
idea
that
he
could
understand
me
surely
he
did
not
hear
what
i
said
as
for
astley
i
have
seen
him
already
and
i
see
that
he
is
here
again
how
do
you
do
she
added
to
the
gentleman
in
question
astley
bowed
in
silence
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
the
old
lady
went
on
say
something
for
goodness
sake
translate
to
him
polina
polina
did
so
i
have
only
to
say
replied
astley
gravely
but
also
with
alacrity
that
i
am
indeed
glad
to
see
you
in
such
good
health
this
was
interpreted
to
the
grandmother
and
she
seemed
much
gratified
how
well
english
people
know
how
to
answer
one
she
remarked
that
is
why
i
like
them
so
much
better
than
french
come
here
she
added
to
astley
i
will
try
not
to
bore
you
too
much
polina
translate
to
him
that
i
am
staying
in
rooms
on
a
lower
floor
yes
on
a
lower
floor
she
repeated
to
astley
pointing
downwards
with
her
finger
astley
looked
pleased
at
receiving
the
invitation
next
the
old
lady
scanned
polina
from
head
to
foot
with
minute
attention
i
could
almost
have
liked
you
prascovia
suddenly
she
remarked
for
you
are
a
nice
girl
the
best
of
the
lot
you
have
some
character
about
you
i
too
have
character
turn
round
surely
that
is
not
false
hair
that
you
are
wearing
no
grandmamma
it
is
my
own
well
well
i
do
not
like
the
stupid
fashions
of
today
you
are
very
good
looking
i
should
have
fallen
in
love
with
you
if
i
had
been
a
man
why
do
you
not
get
married
it
is
time
now
that
i
was
going
i
want
to
walk
yet
i
always
have
to
ride
are
you
still
in
a
bad
temper
she
added
to
the
general
no
indeed
rejoined
the
now
mollified
general
i
quite
understand
that
at
your
time
of
life
cette
vieille
est
tombee
en
enfance
de
griers
whispered
to
me
but
i
want
to
look
round
a
little
the
old
lady
added
to
the
general
will
you
lend
me
alexis
ivanovitch
for
the
purpose
as
much
as
you
like
but
i
myself
yes
and
polina
and
monsieur
de
griers
too
we
all
of
us
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
escorting
you
mais
madame
cela
sera
un
plaisir
de
griers
commented
with
a
bewitching
smile
indeed
why
i
look
upon
you
as
a
perfect
fool
monsieur
then
she
remarked
to
the
general
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
have
any
of
my
money
i
must
be
off
to
my
rooms
now
to
see
what
they
are
like
afterwards
we
will
look
round
a
little
lift
me
up
again
the
grandmother
was
borne
aloft
and
carried
down
the
staircase
amid
a
perfect
bevy
of
followers
the
general
walking
as
though
he
had
been
hit
over
the
head
with
a
cudgel
and
de
griers
seeming
to
be
plunged
in
thought
endeavouring
to
be
left
behind
mlle
blanche
next
thought
better
of
it
and
followed
the
rest
with
the
prince
in
her
wake
only
the
german
savant
and
madame
de
cominges
did
not
leave
the
general
apartments
x
at
spas
and
probably
all
over
europe
hotel
landlords
and
managers
are
guided
in
their
allotment
of
rooms
to
visitors
not
so
much
by
the
wishes
and
requirements
of
those
visitors
as
by
their
personal
estimate
of
the
same
it
may
also
be
said
that
these
landlords
and
managers
seldom
make
a
mistake
to
the
grandmother
however
our
landlord
for
some
reason
or
another
allotted
such
a
sumptuous
suite
that
he
fairly
overreached
himself
for
he
assigned
her
a
suite
consisting
of
four
magnificently
appointed
rooms
with
bathroom
servants
quarters
a
separate
room
for
her
maid
and
so
on
in
fact
during
the
previous
week
the
suite
had
been
occupied
by
no
less
a
personage
than
a
grand
duchess
which
circumstance
was
duly
explained
to
the
new
occupant
as
an
excuse
for
raising
the
price
of
these
apartments
the
grandmother
had
herself
carried
or
rather
wheeled
through
each
room
in
turn
in
order
that
she
might
subject
the
whole
to
a
close
and
attentive
scrutiny
while
the
landlord
an
elderly
man
walked
respectfully
by
her
side
what
every
one
took
the
grandmother
to
be
i
do
not
know
but
it
appeared
at
least
that
she
was
accounted
a
person
not
only
of
great
importance
but
also
and
still
more
of
great
wealth
and
without
delay
they
entered
her
in
the
hotel
register
as
madame
la
generale
princesse
de
tarassevitcheva
although
she
had
never
been
a
princess
in
her
life
her
retinue
her
reserved
compartment
in
the
train
her
pile
of
unnecessary
trunks
portmanteaux
and
all
helped
to
increase
her
prestige
while
her
wheeled
chair
her
sharp
tone
and
voice
her
eccentric
questions
put
with
an
air
of
the
most
overbearing
and
unbridled
imperiousness
her
whole
figure
upright
rugged
and
commanding
as
it
was
completed
the
general
awe
in
which
she
was
held
as
she
inspected
her
new
abode
she
ordered
her
chair
to
be
stopped
at
intervals
in
order
that
with
finger
extended
towards
some
article
of
furniture
she
might
ply
the
respectfully
smiling
yet
secretly
apprehensive
landlord
with
unexpected
questions
she
addressed
them
to
him
in
french
although
her
pronunciation
of
the
language
was
so
bad
that
sometimes
i
had
to
translate
them
for
the
most
part
the
landlord
answers
were
unsatisfactory
and
failed
to
please
her
nor
were
the
questions
themselves
of
a
practical
nature
but
related
generally
to
god
knows
what
for
instance
on
one
occasion
she
halted
before
a
picture
which
a
poor
copy
of
a
original
had
a
mythological
subject
of
whom
is
this
a
portrait
she
inquired
the
landlord
explained
that
it
was
probably
that
of
a
countess
but
how
know
you
that
the
old
lady
retorted
you
live
here
yet
you
can
not
say
for
certain
and
why
is
the
picture
there
at
all
and
why
do
its
eyes
look
so
crooked
to
all
these
questions
the
landlord
could
return
no
satisfactory
reply
despite
his
floundering
endeavours
the
blockhead
exclaimed
the
grandmother
in
russian
then
she
proceeded
on
her
way
only
to
repeat
the
same
story
in
front
of
a
saxon
statuette
which
she
had
sighted
from
afar
and
had
commanded
for
some
reason
or
another
to
be
brought
to
her
finally
she
inquired
of
the
landlord
what
was
the
value
of
the
carpet
in
her
bedroom
as
well
as
where
the
said
carpet
had
been
manufactured
but
the
landlord
could
do
no
more
than
promise
to
make
inquiries
what
donkeys
these
people
are
she
commented
next
she
turned
her
attention
to
the
bed
what
a
huge
counterpane
she
exclaimed
turn
it
back
please
the
lacqueys
did
so
further
yet
further
yet
the
old
lady
cried
turn
it
right
back
also
take
off
those
pillows
and
bolsters
and
lift
up
the
feather
bed
the
bed
was
opened
for
her
inspection
mercifully
it
contains
no
bugs
she
remarked
pull
off
the
whole
thing
and
then
put
on
my
own
pillows
and
sheets
the
place
is
too
luxurious
for
an
old
woman
like
myself
it
is
too
large
for
any
one
person
alexis
ivanovitch
come
and
see
me
whenever
you
are
not
teaching
your
pupils
after
tomorrow
i
shall
no
longer
be
in
the
general
service
i
replied
but
merely
living
in
the
hotel
on
my
own
account
why
so
because
the
other
day
there
arrived
from
berlin
a
german
and
his
wife
persons
of
some
importance
and
it
chanced
that
when
taking
a
walk
i
spoke
to
them
in
german
without
having
properly
compassed
the
berlin
accent
indeed
yes
and
this
action
on
my
part
the
baron
held
to
be
an
insult
and
complained
about
it
to
the
general
who
yesterday
dismissed
me
from
his
employ
but
i
suppose
you
must
have
threatened
that
precious
baron
or
something
of
the
kind
however
even
if
you
did
so
it
was
a
matter
of
no
moment
no
i
did
not
the
baron
was
the
aggressor
by
raising
his
stick
at
me
upon
that
the
grandmother
turned
sharply
to
the
general
what
you
permitted
yourself
to
treat
your
tutor
thus
you
nincompoop
and
to
dismiss
him
from
his
post
you
are
a
blockhead
an
utter
blockhead
i
can
see
that
clearly
do
not
alarm
yourself
my
dear
mother
the
general
replied
with
a
lofty
air
an
air
in
which
there
was
also
a
tinge
of
familiarity
i
am
quite
capable
of
managing
my
own
affairs
moreover
alexis
ivanovitch
has
not
given
you
a
true
account
of
the
matter
what
did
you
do
next
the
old
lady
inquired
of
me
i
wanted
to
challenge
the
baron
to
a
duel
i
replied
as
modestly
as
possible
but
the
general
protested
against
my
doing
so
and
why
did
you
so
protest
she
inquired
of
the
general
then
she
turned
to
the
landlord
and
questioned
him
as
to
whether
he
would
not
have
fought
a
duel
if
challenged
for
she
added
i
can
see
no
difference
between
you
and
the
baron
nor
can
i
bear
that
german
visage
of
yours
upon
this
the
landlord
bowed
and
departed
though
he
could
not
have
understood
the
grandmother
compliment
pardon
me
madame
the
general
continued
with
a
sneer
but
are
duels
really
feasible
why
not
all
men
are
crowing
cocks
and
that
is
why
they
quarrel
you
though
i
perceive
are
a
blockhead
a
man
who
does
not
even
know
how
to
carry
his
breeding
lift
me
up
potapitch
see
to
it
that
you
always
have
two
bearers
ready
go
and
arrange
for
their
hire
but
we
shall
not
require
more
than
two
for
i
shall
need
only
to
be
carried
upstairs
on
the
level
or
in
the
street
i
can
be
wheeled
along
go
and
tell
them
that
and
pay
them
in
advance
so
that
they
may
show
me
some
respect
you
too
potapitch
are
always
to
come
with
me
and
you
alexis
ivanovitch
are
to
point
out
to
me
this
baron
as
we
go
along
in
order
that
i
may
get
a
squint
at
the
precious
and
where
is
that
roulette
played
i
explained
to
her
that
the
game
was
carried
on
in
the
salons
of
the
casino
whereupon
there
ensued
a
string
of
questions
as
to
whether
there
were
many
such
salons
whether
many
people
played
in
them
whether
those
people
played
a
whole
day
at
a
time
and
whether
the
game
was
managed
according
to
fixed
rules
at
length
i
thought
it
best
to
say
that
the
most
advisable
course
would
be
for
her
to
go
and
see
it
for
herself
since
a
mere
description
of
it
would
be
a
difficult
matter
then
take
me
straight
there
she
said
and
do
you
walk
on
in
front
of
me
alexis
ivanovitch
what
mother
before
you
have
so
much
as
rested
from
your
journey
the
general
inquired
with
some
solicitude
also
for
some
reason
which
i
could
not
divine
he
seemed
to
be
growing
nervous
and
indeed
the
whole
party
was
evincing
signs
of
confusion
and
exchanging
glances
with
one
another
probably
they
were
thinking
that
it
would
be
a
ticklish
even
an
embarrassing
business
to
accompany
the
grandmother
to
the
casino
where
very
likely
she
would
perpetrate
further
eccentricities
and
in
public
too
yet
on
their
own
initiative
they
had
offered
to
escort
her
why
should
i
rest
she
retorted
i
am
not
tired
for
i
have
been
sitting
still
these
past
five
days
let
us
see
what
your
medicinal
springs
and
waters
are
like
and
where
they
are
situated
what
too
about
that
that
what
did
you
call
it
prascovia
oh
about
that
mountain
top
yes
we
are
going
to
see
it
grandmamma
very
well
is
there
anything
else
for
me
to
see
here
yes
quite
a
number
of
things
polina
forced
herself
to
say
martha
you
must
come
with
me
as
well
went
on
the
old
lady
to
her
maid
no
no
mother
ejaculated
the
general
really
she
can
not
come
they
would
not
admit
even
potapitch
to
the
casino
rubbish
because
she
is
my
servant
is
that
a
reason
for
turning
her
out
why
she
is
only
a
human
being
like
the
rest
of
us
and
as
she
has
been
travelling
for
a
week
she
might
like
to
look
about
her
with
whom
else
could
she
go
out
but
myself
she
would
never
dare
to
show
her
nose
in
the
street
alone
but
mother
are
you
ashamed
to
be
seen
with
me
stop
at
home
then
and
you
will
be
asked
no
questions
a
pretty
general
you
are
to
be
sure
i
am
a
general
widow
myself
but
after
all
why
should
i
drag
the
whole
party
with
me
i
will
go
and
see
the
sights
with
only
alexis
ivanovitch
as
my
escort
de
griers
strongly
insisted
that
every
one
ought
to
accompany
her
indeed
he
launched
out
into
a
perfect
shower
of
charming
phrases
concerning
the
pleasure
of
acting
as
her
cicerone
and
so
forth
every
one
was
touched
with
his
words
mais
elle
est
tombee
en
enfance
he
added
aside
to
the
general
seule
elle
fera
des
betises
more
than
this
i
could
not
overhear
but
he
seemed
to
have
got
some
plan
in
his
mind
or
even
to
be
feeling
a
slight
return
of
his
hopes
the
distance
to
the
casino
was
about
half
a
verst
and
our
route
led
us
through
the
chestnut
avenue
until
we
reached
the
square
directly
fronting
the
building
the
general
i
could
see
was
a
trifle
reassured
by
the
fact
that
though
our
progress
was
distinctly
eccentric
in
its
nature
it
was
at
least
correct
and
orderly
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
spectacle
of
a
person
who
is
unable
to
walk
is
not
anything
to
excite
surprise
at
a
spa
yet
it
was
clear
that
the
general
had
a
great
fear
of
the
casino
itself
for
why
should
a
person
who
had
lost
the
use
of
her
limbs
more
especially
an
old
woman
be
going
to
rooms
which
were
set
apart
only
for
roulette
on
either
side
of
the
wheeled
chair
walked
polina
and
mlle
blanche
the
latter
smiling
modestly
jesting
and
in
short
making
herself
so
agreeable
to
the
grandmother
that
in
the
end
the
old
lady
relented
towards
her
on
the
other
side
of
the
chair
polina
had
to
answer
an
endless
flow
of
petty
questions
such
as
who
was
it
passed
just
now
who
is
that
coming
along
is
the
town
a
large
one
are
the
public
gardens
extensive
what
sort
of
trees
are
those
what
is
the
name
of
those
hills
do
i
see
eagles
flying
yonder
what
is
that
building
and
so
forth
meanwhile
astley
whispered
to
me
as
he
walked
by
my
side
that
he
looked
for
much
to
happen
that
morning
behind
the
old
lady
chair
marched
potapitch
and
martha
potapitch
in
his
frockcoat
and
white
waistcoat
with
a
cloak
over
all
and
the
and
rosy
but
slightly
martha
in
a
mobcap
cotton
dress
and
squeaking
shoes
frequently
the
old
lady
would
twist
herself
round
to
converse
with
these
servants
as
for
de
griers
he
spoke
as
though
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
do
something
though
it
is
also
possible
that
he
spoke
in
this
manner
merely
in
order
to
hearten
the
general
with
whom
he
appeared
to
have
held
a
conference
but
alas
the
grandmother
had
uttered
the
fatal
words
i
am
not
going
to
give
you
any
of
my
money
and
though
de
griers
might
regard
these
words
lightly
the
general
knew
his
mother
better
also
i
noticed
that
de
griers
and
mlle
blanche
were
still
exchanging
looks
while
of
the
prince
and
the
german
savant
i
lost
sight
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
where
they
had
turned
back
and
left
us
into
the
casino
we
marched
in
triumph
at
once
both
in
the
person
of
the
commissionaire
and
in
the
persons
of
the
footmen
there
sprang
to
life
the
same
reverence
as
had
arisen
in
the
lacqueys
of
the
hotel
yet
it
was
not
without
some
curiosity
that
they
eyed
us
without
loss
of
time
the
grandmother
gave
orders
that
she
should
be
wheeled
through
every
room
in
the
establishment
of
which
apartments
she
praised
a
few
while
to
others
she
remained
indifferent
concerning
everything
however
she
asked
questions
finally
we
reached
the
where
a
lacquey
who
was
acting
as
guard
over
the
doors
flung
them
open
as
though
he
were
a
man
possessed
the
grandmother
entry
into
the
produced
a
profound
impression
upon
the
public
around
the
tables
and
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
where
the
table
was
set
out
there
may
have
been
gathered
from
to
gamblers
ranged
in
several
rows
those
who
had
succeeded
in
pushing
their
way
to
the
tables
were
standing
with
their
feet
firmly
planted
in
order
to
avoid
having
to
give
up
their
places
until
they
should
have
finished
their
game
since
merely
to
stand
looking
on
thus
occupying
a
gambler
place
for
nothing
was
not
permitted
true
chairs
were
provided
around
the
tables
but
few
players
made
use
of
them
more
especially
if
there
was
a
large
attendance
of
the
general
public
since
to
stand
allowed
of
a
closer
approach
and
therefore
of
greater
facilities
for
calculation
and
staking
behind
the
foremost
row
were
herded
a
second
and
a
third
row
of
people
awaiting
their
turn
but
sometimes
their
impatience
led
these
people
to
stretch
a
hand
through
the
first
row
in
order
to
deposit
their
stakes
even
individuals
would
dart
forward
to
stake
whence
seldom
did
more
than
five
or
ten
minutes
pass
without
a
scene
over
disputed
money
arising
at
one
or
another
end
of
the
table
on
the
other
hand
the
police
of
the
casino
were
an
able
body
of
men
and
though
to
escape
the
crush
was
an
impossibility
however
much
one
might
wish
it
the
eight
croupiers
apportioned
to
each
table
kept
an
eye
upon
the
stakes
performed
the
necessary
reckoning
and
decided
disputes
as
they
arose
in
the
last
resort
they
always
called
in
the
casino
police
and
the
disputes
would
immediately
come
to
an
end
policemen
were
stationed
about
the
casino
in
ordinary
costume
and
mingled
with
the
spectators
so
as
to
make
it
impossible
to
recognise
them
in
particular
they
kept
a
lookout
for
pickpockets
and
swindlers
who
simply
swanned
in
the
roulette
salons
and
reaped
a
rich
harvest
indeed
in
every
direction
money
was
being
filched
from
pockets
or
purses
though
of
course
if
the
attempt
miscarried
a
great
uproar
ensued
one
had
only
to
approach
a
roulette
table
begin
to
play
and
then
openly
grab
some
one
winnings
for
a
din
to
be
raised
and
the
thief
to
start
vociferating
that
the
stake
was
his
and
if
the
coup
had
been
carried
out
with
sufficient
skill
and
the
witnesses
wavered
at
all
in
their
testimony
the
thief
would
as
likely
as
not
succeed
in
getting
away
with
the
money
provided
that
the
sum
was
not
a
large
one
not
large
enough
to
have
attracted
the
attention
of
the
croupiers
or
some
moreover
if
it
were
a
stake
of
insignificant
size
its
true
owner
would
sometimes
decline
to
continue
the
dispute
rather
than
become
involved
in
a
scandal
conversely
if
the
thief
was
detected
he
was
ignominiously
expelled
the
building
upon
all
this
the
grandmother
gazed
with
curiosity
and
on
some
thieves
happening
to
be
turned
out
of
the
place
she
was
delighted
interested
her
but
little
she
preferred
roulette
with
its
wheel
at
length
she
expressed
a
wish
to
view
the
game
closer
whereupon
in
some
mysterious
manner
the
lacqueys
and
other
officious
agents
especially
one
or
two
ruined
poles
of
the
kind
who
keep
offering
their
services
to
successful
gamblers
and
foreigners
in
general
at
once
found
and
cleared
a
space
for
the
old
lady
among
the
crush
at
the
very
centre
of
one
of
the
tables
and
next
to
the
chief
croupier
after
which
they
wheeled
her
chair
thither
upon
this
a
number
of
visitors
who
were
not
playing
but
only
looking
on
particularly
some
englishmen
with
their
families
pressed
closer
forward
towards
the
table
in
order
to
watch
the
old
lady
from
among
the
ranks
of
the
gamblers
many
a
lorgnette
i
saw
turned
in
her
direction
and
the
croupiers
hopes
rose
high
that
such
an
eccentric
player
was
about
to
provide
them
with
something
out
of
the
common
an
old
lady
of
years
who
though
unable
to
walk
desired
to
play
was
not
an
everyday
phenomenon
i
too
pressed
forward
towards
the
table
and
ranged
myself
by
the
grandmother
side
while
martha
and
potapitch
remained
somewhere
in
the
background
among
the
crowd
and
the
general
polina
and
de
griers
with
mlle
blanche
also
remained
hidden
among
the
spectators
at
first
the
old
lady
did
no
more
than
watch
the
gamblers
and
ply
me
in
a
with
questions
as
to
who
was
especially
did
her
favour
light
upon
a
very
young
man
who
was
plunging
heavily
and
had
won
so
it
was
whispered
as
much
as
francs
which
were
lying
before
him
on
the
table
in
a
heap
of
gold
and
his
eyes
kept
flashing
and
his
hands
shaking
yet
all
the
while
he
staked
without
any
sort
of
calculation
just
what
came
to
his
hand
as
he
kept
winning
and
winning
and
raking
and
raking
in
his
gains
around
him
lacqueys
fussed
placing
chairs
just
behind
where
he
was
standing
and
clearing
the
spectators
from
his
vicinity
so
that
he
should
have
more
room
and
not
be
crowded
the
whole
done
of
course
in
expectation
of
a
generous
largesse
from
time
to
time
other
gamblers
would
hand
him
part
of
their
winnings
being
glad
to
let
him
stake
for
them
as
much
as
his
hand
could
grasp
while
beside
him
stood
a
pole
in
a
state
of
violent
but
respectful
agitation
who
also
in
expectation
of
a
generous
largesse
kept
whispering
to
him
at
intervals
probably
telling
him
what
to
stake
and
advising
and
directing
his
play
yet
never
once
did
the
player
throw
him
a
glance
as
he
staked
and
staked
and
raked
in
his
winnings
evidently
the
player
in
question
was
dead
to
all
besides
for
a
few
minutes
the
grandmother
watched
him
go
and
tell
him
suddenly
she
exclaimed
with
a
nudge
at
my
elbow
go
and
tell
him
to
stop
and
to
take
his
money
with
him
and
go
home
presently
he
will
be
losing
yes
losing
everything
that
he
has
now
won
she
seemed
almost
breathless
with
excitement
where
is
potapitch
she
continued
send
potapitch
to
speak
to
him
no
you
must
tell
him
you
must
tell
him
here
she
nudged
me
again
for
i
have
not
the
least
notion
where
potapitch
is
sortez
sortez
she
shouted
to
the
young
man
until
i
leant
over
in
her
direction
and
whispered
in
her
ear
that
no
shouting
was
allowed
nor
even
loud
speaking
since
to
do
so
disturbed
the
calculations
of
the
players
and
might
lead
to
our
being
ejected
how
provoking
she
retorted
then
the
young
man
is
done
for
i
suppose
he
wishes
to
be
ruined
yet
i
could
not
bear
to
see
him
have
to
return
it
all
what
a
fool
the
fellow
is
and
the
old
lady
turned
sharply
away
on
the
left
among
the
players
at
the
other
half
of
the
table
a
young
lady
was
playing
with
beside
her
a
dwarf
who
the
dwarf
may
have
been
whether
a
relative
or
a
person
whom
she
took
with
her
to
act
as
a
foil
i
do
not
know
but
i
had
noticed
her
there
on
previous
occasions
since
everyday
she
entered
the
casino
at
one
precisely
and
departed
at
two
thus
playing
for
exactly
one
hour
being
to
the
attendants
she
always
had
a
seat
provided
for
her
and
taking
some
gold
and
a
few
notes
out
of
her
pocket
would
begin
quietly
coldly
and
after
much
calculation
to
stake
and
mark
down
the
figures
in
pencil
on
a
paper
as
though
striving
to
work
out
a
system
according
to
which
at
given
moments
the
odds
might
group
themselves
always
she
staked
large
coins
and
either
lost
or
won
one
two
or
three
thousand
francs
a
day
but
not
more
after
which
she
would
depart
the
grandmother
took
a
long
look
at
her
that
woman
is
not
losing
she
said
to
whom
does
she
belong
do
you
know
her
who
is
she
she
is
i
believe
a
frenchwoman
i
replied
ah
a
bird
of
passage
evidently
besides
i
can
see
that
she
has
her
shoes
polished
now
explain
to
me
the
meaning
of
each
round
in
the
game
and
the
way
in
which
one
ought
to
stake
upon
this
i
set
myself
to
explain
the
meaning
of
all
the
combinations
of
rouge
et
noir
of
pair
et
impair
of
manque
et
passe
with
lastly
the
different
values
in
the
system
of
numbers
the
grandmother
listened
attentively
took
notes
put
questions
in
various
forms
and
laid
the
whole
thing
to
heart
indeed
since
an
example
of
each
system
of
stakes
kept
constantly
occurring
a
great
deal
of
information
could
be
assimilated
with
ease
and
celerity
the
grandmother
was
vastly
pleased
but
what
is
zero
she
inquired
just
now
i
heard
the
croupier
call
out
and
why
does
he
keep
raking
in
all
the
money
that
is
on
the
table
to
think
that
he
should
grab
the
whole
pile
for
himself
what
does
zero
mean
zero
is
what
the
bank
takes
for
itself
if
the
wheel
stops
at
that
figure
everything
lying
on
the
table
becomes
the
absolute
property
of
the
bank
also
whenever
the
wheel
has
begun
to
turn
the
bank
ceases
to
pay
out
anything
then
i
should
receive
nothing
if
i
were
staking
no
unless
by
any
chance
you
had
purposely
staked
on
zero
in
which
case
you
would
receive
times
the
value
of
your
stake
why
times
when
zero
so
often
turns
up
and
if
so
why
do
not
more
of
these
fools
stake
upon
it
because
the
number
of
chances
against
its
occurrence
is
rubbish
potapitch
potapitch
come
here
and
i
will
give
you
some
money
the
old
lady
took
out
of
her
pocket
a
purse
and
extracted
from
its
depths
a
piece
go
at
once
and
stake
that
upon
zero
but
madame
zero
has
only
this
moment
turned
up
i
remonstrated
wherefore
it
may
not
do
so
again
for
ever
so
long
wait
a
little
and
you
may
then
have
a
better
chance
rubbish
stake
please
pardon
me
but
zero
might
not
turn
up
again
until
say
tonight
even
though
you
had
staked
thousands
upon
it
it
often
happens
so
rubbish
rubbish
who
fears
the
wolf
should
never
enter
the
forest
what
we
have
lost
then
stake
again
a
second
piece
did
we
lose
and
then
i
put
down
a
third
the
grandmother
could
scarcely
remain
seated
in
her
chair
so
intent
was
she
upon
the
little
ball
as
it
leapt
through
the
notches
of
the
wheel
however
the
third
piece
followed
the
first
two
upon
this
the
grandmother
went
perfectly
crazy
she
could
no
longer
sit
still
and
actually
struck
the
table
with
her
fist
when
the
croupier
cried
out
instead
of
the
desiderated
zero
to
listen
to
him
fumed
the
old
lady
when
will
that
accursed
zero
ever
turn
up
i
can
not
breathe
until
i
see
it
i
believe
that
that
infernal
croupier
is
purposely
keeping
it
from
turning
up
alexis
ivanovitch
stake
two
golden
pieces
this
time
the
moment
we
cease
to
stake
that
cursed
zero
will
come
turning
up
and
we
shall
get
nothing
my
good
madame
stake
stake
it
is
not
your
money
accordingly
i
staked
two
pieces
the
ball
went
hopping
round
the
wheel
until
it
began
to
settle
through
the
notches
meanwhile
the
grandmother
sat
as
though
petrified
with
my
hand
convulsively
clutched
in
hers
zero
called
the
croupier
there
you
see
you
see
cried
the
old
lady
as
she
turned
and
faced
me
wreathed
in
smiles
i
told
you
so
it
was
the
lord
god
himself
who
suggested
to
me
to
stake
those
two
coins
now
how
much
ought
i
to
receive
why
do
they
not
pay
it
out
to
me
potapitch
martha
where
are
they
what
has
become
of
our
party
potapitch
potapitch
presently
madame
i
whispered
potapitch
is
outside
and
they
would
decline
to
admit
him
to
these
rooms
see
you
are
being
paid
out
your
money
pray
take
it
the
croupiers
were
making
up
a
heavy
packet
of
coins
sealed
in
blue
paper
and
containing
fifty
ten
gulden
pieces
together
with
an
unsealed
packet
containing
another
twenty
i
handed
the
whole
to
the
old
lady
in
a
faites
le
jeu
messieurs
faites
le
jeu
messieurs
rien
ne
va
plus
proclaimed
the
croupier
as
once
more
he
invited
the
company
to
stake
and
prepared
to
turn
the
wheel
we
shall
be
too
late
he
is
going
to
spin
again
stake
stake
the
grandmother
was
in
a
perfect
fever
do
not
hang
back
be
quick
she
seemed
almost
beside
herself
and
nudged
me
as
hard
as
she
could
upon
what
shall
i
stake
madame
upon
zero
upon
zero
again
upon
zero
stake
as
much
as
ever
you
can
how
much
have
we
got
seventy
pieces
we
shall
not
miss
them
so
stake
twenty
pieces
at
a
time
think
a
moment
madame
sometimes
zero
does
not
turn
up
for
two
hundred
rounds
in
succession
i
assure
you
that
you
may
lose
all
your
capital
you
are
wrong
utterly
wrong
stake
i
tell
you
what
a
chattering
tongue
you
have
i
know
perfectly
well
what
i
am
doing
the
old
lady
was
shaking
with
excitement
but
the
rules
do
not
allow
of
more
than
gulden
being
staked
upon
zero
at
a
time
how
not
allow
surely
you
are
wrong
monsieur
monsieur
here
she
nudged
the
croupier
who
was
sitting
on
her
left
and
preparing
to
spin
combien
zero
douze
douze
i
hastened
to
translate
oui
madame
was
the
croupier
polite
reply
no
single
stake
must
exceed
four
thousand
florins
that
is
the
regulation
then
there
is
nothing
else
for
it
we
must
risk
in
gulden
le
jeu
est
fait
the
croupier
called
the
wheel
revolved
and
stopped
at
thirty
we
had
lost
again
again
again
stake
again
shouted
the
old
lady
without
attempting
to
oppose
her
further
but
merely
shrugging
my
shoulders
i
placed
twelve
more
pieces
upon
the
table
the
wheel
whirled
around
and
around
with
the
grandmother
simply
quaking
as
she
watched
its
revolutions
does
she
again
think
that
zero
is
going
to
be
the
winning
coup
thought
i
as
i
stared
at
her
in
astonishment
yet
an
absolute
assurance
of
winning
was
shining
on
her
face
she
looked
perfectly
convinced
that
zero
was
about
to
be
called
again
at
length
the
ball
dropped
off
into
one
of
the
notches
zero
cried
the
croupier
ah
screamed
the
old
lady
as
she
turned
to
me
in
a
whirl
of
triumph
i
myself
was
at
heart
a
gambler
at
that
moment
i
became
acutely
conscious
both
of
that
fact
and
of
the
fact
that
my
hands
and
knees
were
shaking
and
that
the
blood
was
beating
in
my
brain
of
course
this
was
a
rare
occasion
an
occasion
on
which
zero
had
turned
up
no
less
than
three
times
within
a
dozen
rounds
yet
in
such
an
event
there
was
nothing
so
very
surprising
seeing
that
only
three
days
ago
i
myself
had
been
a
witness
to
zero
turning
up
three
times
in
succession
so
that
one
of
the
players
who
was
recording
the
coups
on
paper
was
moved
to
remark
that
for
several
days
past
zero
had
never
turned
up
at
all
with
the
grandmother
as
with
any
one
who
has
won
a
very
large
sum
the
management
settled
up
with
great
attention
and
respect
since
she
was
fortunate
to
have
to
receive
no
less
than
gulden
of
these
gulden
the
odd
were
paid
her
in
gold
and
the
remainder
in
bank
notes
this
time
the
old
lady
did
not
call
for
potapitch
for
that
she
was
too
preoccupied
though
not
outwardly
shaken
by
the
event
indeed
she
seemed
perfectly
calm
she
was
trembling
inwardly
from
head
to
foot
at
length
completely
absorbed
in
the
game
she
burst
out
alexis
ivanovitch
did
not
the
croupier
just
say
that
florins
were
the
most
that
could
be
staked
at
any
one
time
well
take
these
and
stake
them
upon
the
red
to
oppose
her
was
useless
once
more
the
wheel
revolved
rouge
proclaimed
the
croupier
again
florins
in
all
give
me
them
commanded
the
grandmother
and
stake
the
other
upon
the
red
again
i
did
so
rouge
proclaimed
the
croupier
twelve
thousand
cried
the
old
lady
hand
me
the
whole
lot
put
the
gold
into
this
purse
here
and
count
the
bank
notes
enough
let
us
go
home
wheel
my
chair
away
xi
the
chair
with
the
old
lady
beaming
in
it
was
wheeled
away
towards
the
doors
at
the
further
end
of
the
salon
while
our
party
hastened
to
crowd
around
her
and
to
offer
her
their
congratulations
in
fact
eccentric
as
was
her
conduct
it
was
also
overshadowed
by
her
triumph
with
the
result
that
the
general
no
longer
feared
to
be
publicly
compromised
by
being
seen
with
such
a
strange
woman
but
smiling
in
a
condescending
cheerfully
familiar
way
as
though
he
were
soothing
a
child
he
offered
his
greetings
to
the
old
lady
at
the
same
time
both
he
and
the
rest
of
the
spectators
were
visibly
impressed
everywhere
people
kept
pointing
to
the
grandmother
and
talking
about
her
many
people
even
walked
beside
her
chair
in
order
to
view
her
the
better
while
at
a
little
distance
astley
was
carrying
on
a
conversation
on
the
subject
with
two
english
acquaintances
of
his
de
griers
was
simply
overflowing
with
smiles
and
compliments
and
a
number
of
fine
ladies
were
staring
at
the
grandmother
as
though
she
had
been
something
curious
quelle
victoire
exclaimed
de
griers
mais
madame
du
feu
added
mlle
blanche
with
an
elusive
smile
yes
i
have
won
twelve
thousand
florins
replied
the
old
lady
and
then
there
is
all
this
gold
with
it
the
total
ought
to
come
to
nearly
thirteen
thousand
how
much
is
that
in
russian
money
six
thousand
roubles
i
think
however
i
calculated
that
the
sum
would
exceed
seven
thousand
roubles
or
at
the
present
rate
of
exchange
even
eight
thousand
eight
thousand
roubles
what
a
splendid
thing
and
to
think
of
you
simpletons
sitting
there
and
doing
nothing
potapitch
martha
see
what
i
have
won
how
did
you
do
it
madame
martha
exclaimed
ecstatically
eight
thousand
roubles
and
i
am
going
to
give
you
fifty
gulden
apiece
there
they
are
potapitch
and
martha
rushed
towards
her
to
kiss
her
hand
and
to
each
bearer
also
i
will
give
a
piece
let
them
have
it
out
of
the
gold
alexis
ivanovitch
but
why
is
this
footman
bowing
to
me
and
that
other
man
as
well
are
they
congratulating
me
well
let
them
have
ten
gulden
apiece
madame

said
a
man
who
for
some
time
past
had
been
hanging
around
the
old
lady
chair
a
personage
who
dressed
in
a
shabby
frockcoat
and
coloured
waistcoat
kept
taking
off
his
cap
and
smiling
pathetically
give
him
ten
gulden
said
the
grandmother
no
give
him
twenty
now
enough
of
that
or
i
shall
never
get
done
with
you
all
take
a
rest
and
then
carry
me
away

i
mean
to
buy
a
new
dress
for
you
tomorrow
yes
and
for
you
too
mlle
blanche
please
translate
prascovia
merci
madame
replied
mlle
blanche
gratefully
as
she
twisted
her
face
into
the
mocking
smile
which
usually
she
kept
only
for
the
benefit
of
de
griers
and
the
general
the
latter
looked
confused
and
seemed
greatly
relieved
when
we
reached
the
avenue
how
surprised
theodosia
too
will
be
went
on
the
grandmother
thinking
of
the
general
nursemaid
she
like
yourselves
shall
have
the
price
of
a
new
gown
here
alexis
ivanovitch
give
that
beggar
something
a
ragamuffin
had
approached
to
stare
at
us
but
perhaps
he
is
not
a
beggar
only
a
rascal
i
replied
never
mind
never
mind
give
him
a
gulden
i
approached
the
beggar
in
question
and
handed
him
the
coin
looking
at
me
in
great
astonishment
he
silently
accepted
the
gulden
while
from
his
person
there
proceeded
a
strong
smell
of
liquor
have
you
never
tried
your
luck
alexis
ivanovitch
no
madame
yet
just
now
i
could
see
that
you
were
burning
to
do
so
i
do
mean
to
try
my
luck
presently
then
stake
everything
upon
zero
you
have
seen
how
it
ought
to
be
done
how
much
capital
do
you
possess
two
hundred
gulden
madame
not
very
much
see
here
i
will
lend
you
five
hundred
if
you
wish
take
this
purse
of
mine
with
that
she
added
sharply
to
the
general
but
you
need
not
expect
to
receive
any
this
seemed
to
upset
him
but
he
said
nothing
and
de
griers
contented
himself
by
scowling
que
diable
he
whispered
to
the
general
une
terrible
vieille
look
another
beggar
another
beggar
exclaimed
the
grandmother
alexis
ivanovitch
go
and
give
him
a
gulden
as
she
spoke
i
saw
approaching
us
a
old
man
with
a
wooden
leg
a
man
who
was
dressed
in
a
blue
frockcoat
and
carrying
a
staff
he
looked
like
an
old
soldier
as
soon
as
i
tendered
him
the
coin
he
fell
back
a
step
or
two
and
eyed
me
threateningly
was
ist
der
teufel
he
cried
and
appended
thereto
a
round
dozen
of
oaths
the
man
is
a
perfect
fool
exclaimed
the
grandmother
waving
her
hand
move
on
now
for
i
am
simply
famished
when
we
have
lunched
we
will
return
to
that
place
what
cried
i
you
are
going
to
play
again
what
else
do
you
suppose
she
retorted
are
you
going
only
to
sit
here
and
grow
sour
and
let
me
look
at
you
madame

confidentially
les
chances

tourner

seule
mauvaise
chance
et
vous
perdrez
tout

avec
votre
jeu
terrible
oui
vous
perdrez
absolument
put
in
mlle
blanche
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
you
retorted
the
old
lady
it
is
not
your
money
that
i
am
going
to
lose
it
is
my
own
and
where
is
that
astley
of
yours
she
added
to
myself
he
stayed
behind
in
the
casino
what
a
pity
he
is
such
a
nice
sort
of
man
arriving
home
and
meeting
the
landlord
on
the
staircase
the
grandmother
called
him
to
her
side
and
boasted
to
him
of
her
winnings
thereafter
doing
the
same
to
theodosia
and
conferring
upon
her
thirty
gulden
after
which
she
bid
her
serve
luncheon
the
meal
over
theodosia
and
martha
broke
into
a
joint
flood
of
ecstasy
i
was
watching
you
all
the
time
madame
quavered
martha
and
i
asked
potapitch
what
mistress
was
trying
to
do
and
my
word
the
heaps
and
heaps
of
money
that
were
lying
upon
the
table
never
in
my
life
have
i
seen
so
much
money
and
there
were
gentlefolk
around
it
and
other
gentlefolk
sitting
down
so
i
asked
potapitch
where
all
these
gentry
had
come
from
for
thought
i
maybe
the
holy
mother
of
god
will
help
our
mistress
among
them
yes
i
prayed
for
you
madame
and
my
heart
died
within
me
so
that
i
kept
trembling
and
trembling
the
lord
be
with
her
i
thought
to
myself
and
in
answer
to
my
prayer
he
has
now
sent
you
what
he
has
done
even
yet
i
tremble
i
tremble
to
think
of
it
all
alexis
ivanovitch
said
the
old
lady
after
luncheon
that
is
to
say
about
four
get
ready
to
go
out
with
me
again
but
in
the
meanwhile
do
not
forget
to
call
a
doctor
for
i
must
take
the
waters
now
go
and
get
rested
a
little
i
left
the
grandmother
presence
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
vainly
i
endeavoured
to
imagine
what
would
become
of
our
party
or
what
turn
the
affair
would
next
take
i
could
perceive
that
none
of
the
party
had
yet
recovered
their
presence
of
mind
least
of
all
the
general
the
factor
of
the
grandmother
appearance
in
place
of
the
hourly
expected
telegram
to
announce
her
death
with
of
course
resultant
legacies
had
so
upset
the
whole
scheme
of
intentions
and
projects
that
it
was
with
a
decided
feeling
of
apprehension
and
growing
paralysis
that
the
conspirators
viewed
any
future
performances
of
the
old
lady
at
roulette
yet
this
second
factor
was
not
quite
so
important
as
the
first
since
though
the
grandmother
had
twice
declared
that
she
did
not
intend
to
give
the
general
any
money
that
declaration
was
not
a
complete
ground
for
the
abandonment
of
hope
certainly
de
griers
who
with
the
general
was
up
to
the
neck
in
the
affair
had
not
wholly
lost
courage
and
i
felt
sure
that
mlle
blanche
also
mlle
blanche
who
was
not
only
as
deeply
involved
as
the
other
two
but
also
expectant
of
becoming
madame
general
and
an
important
legatee
would
not
lightly
surrender
the
position
but
would
use
her
every
resource
of
coquetry
upon
the
old
lady
in
order
to
afford
a
contrast
to
the
impetuous
polina
who
was
difficult
to
understand
and
lacked
the
art
of
pleasing
yet
now
when
the
grandmother
had
just
performed
an
astonishing
feat
at
roulette
now
when
the
old
lady
personality
had
been
so
clearly
and
typically
revealed
as
that
of
a
rugged
arrogant
woman
who
was
tombee
en
enfance
now
when
everything
appeared
to
be
lost
why
now
the
grandmother
was
as
merry
as
a
child
which
plays
with
good
lord
i
thought
with
may
god
forgive
me
a
most
malicious
smile
every
piece
which
the
grandmother
staked
must
have
raised
a
blister
on
the
general
heart
and
maddened
de
griers
and
driven
mlle
de
cominges
almost
to
frenzy
with
the
sight
of
this
spoon
dangling
before
her
lips
another
factor
is
the
circumstance
that
even
when
overjoyed
at
winning
the
grandmother
was
distributing
alms
right
and
left
and
taking
every
one
to
be
a
beggar
she
again
snapped
out
to
the
general
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
allowed
any
of
her
money
which
meant
that
the
old
lady
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
on
the
point
and
was
sure
of
it
yes
danger
loomed
ahead
all
these
thoughts
passed
through
my
mind
during
the
few
moments
that
having
left
the
old
lady
rooms
i
was
ascending
to
my
own
room
on
the
top
storey
what
most
struck
me
was
the
fact
that
though
i
had
divined
the
chief
the
stoutest
threads
which
united
the
various
actors
in
the
drama
i
had
until
now
been
ignorant
of
the
methods
and
secrets
of
the
game
for
polina
had
never
been
completely
open
with
me
although
on
occasions
it
had
happened
that
involuntarily
as
it
were
she
had
revealed
to
me
something
of
her
heart
i
had
noticed
that
in
most
cases
in
fact
nearly
always
she
had
either
laughed
away
these
revelations
or
grown
confused
or
purposely
imparted
to
them
a
false
guise
yes
she
must
have
concealed
a
great
deal
from
me
but
i
had
a
presentiment
that
now
the
end
of
this
strained
and
mysterious
situation
was
approaching
another
stroke
and
all
would
be
finished
and
exposed
of
my
own
fortunes
interested
though
i
was
in
the
affair
i
took
no
account
i
was
in
the
strange
position
of
possessing
but
two
hundred
gulden
of
being
at
a
loose
end
of
lacking
both
a
post
the
means
of
subsistence
a
shred
of
hope
and
any
plans
for
the
future
yet
of
caring
nothing
for
these
things
had
not
my
mind
been
so
full
of
polina
i
should
have
given
myself
up
to
the
comical
piquancy
of
the
impending
denouement
and
laughed
my
fill
at
it
but
the
thought
of
polina
was
torture
to
me
that
her
fate
was
settled
i
already
had
an
inkling
yet
that
was
not
the
thought
which
was
giving
me
so
much
uneasiness
what
i
really
wished
for
was
to
penetrate
her
secrets
i
wanted
her
to
come
to
me
and
say
i
love
you
and
if
she
would
not
so
come
or
if
to
hope
that
she
would
ever
do
so
was
an
unthinkable
absurdity
why
then
there
was
nothing
else
for
me
to
want
even
now
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
wanting
i
feel
like
a
man
who
has
lost
his
way
i
yearn
but
to
be
in
her
presence
and
within
the
circle
of
her
light
and
splendour
to
be
there
now
and
forever
and
for
the
whole
of
my
life
more
i
do
not
know
how
can
i
ever
bring
myself
to
leave
her
on
reaching
the
third
storey
of
the
hotel
i
experienced
a
shock
i
was
just
passing
the
general
suite
when
something
caused
me
to
look
round
out
of
a
door
about
twenty
paces
away
there
was
coming
polina
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
on
seeing
me
and
then
beckoned
me
to
her
polina
alexandrovna
hush
not
so
loud
something
startled
me
just
now
i
whispered
and
i
looked
round
and
saw
you
some
electrical
influence
seems
to
emanate
from
your
form
take
this
letter
she
went
on
with
a
frown
probably
she
had
not
even
heard
my
words
she
was
so
preoccupied
and
hand
it
personally
to
astley
go
as
quickly
as
ever
you
can
please
no
answer
will
be
required
he
himself
she
did
not
finish
her
sentence
to
mr
astley
i
asked
in
some
astonishment
but
she
had
vanished
again
aha
so
the
two
were
carrying
on
a
correspondence
however
i
set
off
to
search
for
astley
first
at
his
hotel
and
then
at
the
casino
where
i
went
the
round
of
the
salons
in
vain
at
length
vexed
and
almost
in
despair
i
was
on
my
way
home
when
i
ran
across
him
among
a
troop
of
english
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
had
been
out
for
a
ride
beckoning
to
him
to
stop
i
handed
him
the
letter
we
had
barely
time
even
to
look
at
one
another
but
i
suspected
that
it
was
of
set
purpose
that
he
restarted
his
horse
so
quickly
was
jealousy
then
gnawing
at
me
at
all
events
i
felt
exceedingly
depressed
despite
the
fact
that
i
had
no
desire
to
ascertain
what
the
correspondence
was
about
to
think
that
he
should
be
her
confidant
my
friend
mine
own
familiar
friend
passed
through
my
mind
yet
was
there
any
love
in
the
matter
of
course
not
reason
whispered
to
me
but
reason
goes
for
little
on
such
occasions
i
felt
that
the
matter
must
be
cleared
up
for
it
was
becoming
unpleasantly
complex
i
had
scarcely
set
foot
in
the
hotel
when
the
commissionaire
and
the
landlord
the
latter
issuing
from
his
room
for
the
purpose
alike
informed
me
that
i
was
being
searched
for
high
and
low
that
three
separate
messages
to
ascertain
my
whereabouts
had
come
down
from
the
general
when
i
entered
his
study
i
was
feeling
anything
but
kindly
disposed
i
found
there
the
general
himself
de
griers
and
mlle
blanche
but
not
mlle
mother
who
was
a
person
whom
her
reputed
daughter
used
only
for
show
purposes
since
in
all
matters
of
business
the
daughter
fended
for
herself
and
it
is
unlikely
that
the
mother
knew
anything
about
them
some
very
heated
discussion
was
in
progress
and
meanwhile
the
door
of
the
study
was
open
an
unprecedented
circumstance
as
i
approached
the
portals
i
could
hear
loud
voices
raised
for
mingled
with
the
pert
venomous
accents
of
de
griers
were
mlle
blanche
excited
impudently
abusive
tongue
and
the
general
plaintive
wail
as
apparently
he
sought
to
justify
himself
in
something
but
on
my
appearance
every
one
stopped
speaking
and
tried
to
put
a
better
face
upon
matters
de
griers
smoothed
his
hair
and
twisted
his
angry
face
into
a
smile
into
the
mean
studiedly
polite
french
smile
which
i
so
detested
while
the
downcast
perplexed
general
assumed
an
air
of
dignity
though
only
in
a
mechanical
way
on
the
other
hand
mlle
blanche
did
not
trouble
to
conceal
the
wrath
that
was
sparkling
in
her
countenance
but
bent
her
gaze
upon
me
with
an
air
of
impatient
expectancy
i
may
remark
that
hitherto
she
had
treated
me
with
absolute
superciliousness
and
so
far
from
answering
my
salutations
had
always
ignored
them
alexis
ivanovitch
began
the
general
in
a
tone
of
affectionate
upbraiding
may
i
say
to
you
that
i
find
it
strange
exceedingly
strange
that
in
short
your
conduct
towards
myself
and
my
family
in
a
word
your
er
extremely
eh
ce
pas
ca
interrupted
de
griers
in
a
tone
of
impatience
and
contempt
evidently
he
was
the
ruling
spirit
of
the
conclave
mon
cher
monsieur
notre
general
se
trompe
what
he
means
to
say
is
that
he
warns
you
he
begs
of
you
most
earnestly
not
to
ruin
him
i
use
the
expression
because
why
why
i
interjected
because
you
have
taken
upon
yourself
to
act
as
guide
to
this
to
this
how
shall
i
express
it
to
this
old
lady
a
cette
pauvre
terrible
vieille
but
she
will
only
gamble
away
all
that
she
has
gamble
it
away
like
thistledown
you
yourself
have
seen
her
play
once
she
has
acquired
the
taste
for
gambling
she
will
never
leave
the
but
of
sheer
perversity
and
temper
will
stake
her
all
and
lose
it
in
cases
such
as
hers
a
gambler
can
never
be
torn
away
from
the
game
and
then
and
then
and
then
asseverated
the
general
you
will
have
ruined
my
whole
family
i
and
my
family
are
her
heirs
for
she
has
no
nearer
relatives
than
ourselves
i
tell
you
frankly
that
my
affairs
are
in
great
very
great
disorder
how
much
they
are
so
you
yourself
are
partially
aware
if
she
should
lose
a
large
sum
or
maybe
her
whole
fortune
what
will
become
of
us
of
my
children
here
the
general
exchanged
a
glance
with
de
griers
or
of
me
here
he
looked
at
mlle
blanche
who
turned
her
head
contemptuously
away
alexis
ivanovitch
i
beg
of
you
to
save
us
tell
me
general
how
am
i
to
do
so
on
what
footing
do
i
stand
here
refuse
to
take
her
about
simply
leave
her
alone
but
she
would
soon
find
some
one
else
to
take
my
place
ce
pas
ca
ce
pas
ca
again
interrupted
de
griers
que
diable
do
not
leave
her
alone
so
much
as
advise
her
persuade
her
draw
her
away
in
any
case
do
not
let
her
gamble
find
her
some
and
how
am
i
to
do
that
if
only
you
would
undertake
the
task
monsieur
de
griers
i
said
this
last
as
innocently
as
possible
but
at
once
saw
a
rapid
glance
of
excited
interrogation
pass
from
mlle
blanche
to
de
griers
while
in
the
face
of
the
latter
also
there
gleamed
something
which
he
could
not
repress
well
at
the
present
moment
she
would
refuse
to
accept
my
services
said
he
with
a
gesture
but
if
later
here
he
gave
mlle
blanche
another
glance
which
was
full
of
meaning
whereupon
she
advanced
towards
me
with
a
bewitching
smile
and
seized
and
pressed
my
hands
devil
take
it
but
how
that
devilish
visage
of
hers
could
change
at
the
present
moment
it
was
a
visage
full
of
supplication
and
as
gentle
in
its
expression
as
that
of
a
smiling
roguish
infant
stealthily
she
drew
me
apart
from
the
rest
as
though
the
more
completely
to
separate
me
from
them
and
though
no
harm
came
of
her
doing
so
for
it
was
merely
a
stupid
manoeuvre
and
no
more
i
found
the
situation
very
unpleasant
the
general
hastened
to
lend
her
his
support
alexis
ivanovitch
he
began
pray
pardon
me
for
having
said
what
i
did
just
now
for
having
said
more
than
i
meant
to
do
i
beg
and
beseech
you
i
kiss
the
hem
of
your
garment
as
our
russian
saying
has
it
for
you
and
only
you
can
save
us
i
and
mlle
de
cominges
we
all
of
us
beg
of
you
but
you
understand
do
you
not
surely
you
understand
and
with
his
eyes
he
indicated
mlle
blanche
truly
he
was
cutting
a
pitiful
figure
at
this
moment
three
low
respectful
knocks
sounded
at
the
door
which
on
being
opened
revealed
a
chambermaid
with
potapitch
behind
her
come
from
the
grandmother
to
request
that
i
should
attend
her
in
her
rooms
she
is
in
a
bad
humour
added
potapitch
the
time
was
three
my
mistress
was
unable
to
sleep
explained
potapitch
so
after
tossing
about
for
a
while
she
suddenly
rose
called
for
her
chair
and
sent
me
to
look
for
you
she
is
now
in
the
verandah
quelle
megere
exclaimed
de
griers
true
enough
i
found
madame
in
the
hotel
verandah
much
put
about
at
my
delay
for
she
had
been
unable
to
contain
herself
until
four
lift
me
up
she
cried
to
the
bearers
and
once
more
we
set
out
for
the
xii
the
grandmother
was
in
an
impatient
irritable
frame
of
mind
without
doubt
the
roulette
had
turned
her
head
for
she
appeared
to
be
indifferent
to
everything
else
and
in
general
seemed
much
distraught
for
instance
she
asked
me
no
questions
about
objects
en
route
except
that
when
a
sumptuous
barouche
passed
us
and
raised
a
cloud
of
dust
she
lifted
her
hand
for
a
moment
and
inquired
what
was
that
yet
even
then
she
did
not
appear
to
hear
my
reply
although
at
times
her
abstraction
was
interrupted
by
sallies
and
fits
of
sharp
impatient
fidgeting
again
when
i
pointed
out
to
her
the
baron
and
baroness
burmergelm
walking
to
the
casino
she
merely
looked
at
them
in
an
sort
of
way
and
said
with
complete
indifference
ah
then
turning
sharply
to
potapitch
and
martha
who
were
walking
behind
us
she
rapped
out
why
have
you
attached
yourselves
to
the
party
we
are
not
going
to
take
you
with
us
every
time
go
home
at
once
then
when
the
servants
had
pulled
hasty
bows
and
departed
she
added
to
me
you
are
all
the
escort
i
need
at
the
casino
the
grandmother
seemed
to
be
expected
for
no
time
was
lost
in
procuring
her
former
place
beside
the
croupier
it
is
my
opinion
that
though
croupiers
seem
such
ordinary
humdrum
officials
men
who
care
nothing
whether
the
bank
wins
or
loses
they
are
in
reality
anything
but
indifferent
to
the
bank
losing
and
are
given
instructions
to
attract
players
and
to
keep
a
watch
over
the
bank
interests
as
also
that
for
such
services
these
officials
are
awarded
prizes
and
premiums
at
all
events
the
croupiers
of
roulettenberg
seemed
to
look
upon
the
grandmother
as
their
lawful
prey
whereafter
there
befell
what
our
party
had
foretold
it
happened
thus
as
soon
as
ever
we
arrived
the
grandmother
ordered
me
to
stake
twelve
pieces
in
succession
upon
zero
once
twice
and
thrice
i
did
so
yet
zero
never
turned
up
stake
again
said
the
old
lady
with
an
impatient
nudge
of
my
elbow
and
i
obeyed
how
many
times
have
we
lost
she
inquired
actually
grinding
her
teeth
in
her
excitement
we
have
lost
pieces
i
replied
i
tell
you
madame
that
zero
may
not
turn
up
until
nightfall
never
mind
she
interrupted
keep
on
staking
upon
zero
and
also
stake
a
thousand
gulden
upon
rouge
here
is
a
banknote
with
which
to
do
so
the
red
turned
up
but
zero
missed
again
and
we
only
got
our
thousand
gulden
back
but
you
see
you
see
whispered
the
old
lady
we
have
now
recovered
almost
all
that
we
staked
try
zero
again
let
us
do
so
another
ten
times
and
then
leave
off
by
the
fifth
round
however
the
grandmother
was
weary
of
the
scheme
to
the
devil
with
that
zero
she
exclaimed
stake
four
thousand
gulden
upon
the
red
but
madame
that
will
be
so
much
to
venture
i
remonstrated
suppose
the
red
should
not
turn
up
the
grandmother
almost
struck
me
in
her
excitement
her
agitation
was
rapidly
making
her
quarrelsome
consequently
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
stake
the
whole
four
thousand
gulden
as
she
had
directed
the
wheel
revolved
while
the
grandmother
sat
as
bolt
upright
and
with
as
proud
and
quiet
a
mien
as
though
she
had
not
the
least
doubt
of
winning
zero
cried
the
croupier
at
first
the
old
lady
failed
to
understand
the
situation
but
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
croupier
raking
in
her
four
thousand
gulden
together
with
everything
else
that
happened
to
be
lying
on
the
table
and
recognised
that
the
zero
which
had
been
so
long
turning
up
and
on
which
we
had
lost
nearly
two
hundred
pieces
had
at
length
as
though
of
set
purpose
made
a
sudden
reappearance
why
the
poor
old
lady
fell
to
cursing
it
and
to
throwing
herself
about
and
wailing
and
gesticulating
at
the
company
at
large
indeed
some
people
in
our
vicinity
actually
burst
out
laughing
to
think
that
that
accursed
zero
should
have
turned
up
now
she
sobbed
the
accursed
accursed
thing
and
it
is
all
your
fault
she
added
rounding
upon
me
in
a
frenzy
it
was
you
who
persuaded
me
to
cease
staking
upon
it
but
madame
i
only
explained
the
game
to
you
how
am
i
to
answer
for
every
mischance
which
may
occur
in
it
you
and
your
mischances
she
whispered
threateningly
go
away
at
once
farewell
then
madame
and
i
turned
to
depart
no
stay
she
put
in
hastily
where
are
you
going
to
why
should
you
leave
me
you
fool
no
no
stay
here
it
is
i
who
was
the
fool
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
do
i
can
not
take
it
upon
myself
to
advise
you
for
you
will
only
blame
me
if
i
do
so
play
at
your
own
discretion
say
exactly
what
you
wish
staked
and
i
will
stake
it
very
well
stake
another
four
thousand
gulden
upon
the
red
take
this
banknote
to
do
it
with
i
have
still
got
twenty
thousand
roubles
in
actual
cash
but
i
whispered
such
a
quantity
of
money
never
mind
i
can
not
rest
until
i
have
won
back
my
losses
stake
i
staked
and
we
lost
stake
again
stake
again
eight
thousand
at
a
stroke
i
can
not
madame
the
largest
stake
allowed
is
four
thousand
gulden
well
then
stake
four
thousand
this
time
we
won
and
the
grandmother
recovered
herself
a
little
you
see
you
see
she
exclaimed
as
she
nudged
me
stake
another
four
thousand
i
did
so
and
lost
again
and
yet
again
we
lost
madame
your
twelve
thousand
gulden
are
now
gone
at
length
i
reported
i
see
they
are
she
replied
with
as
it
were
the
calmness
of
despair
i
see
they
are
she
muttered
again
as
she
gazed
straight
in
front
of
her
like
a
person
lost
in
thought
ah
well
i
do
not
mean
to
rest
until
i
have
staked
another
four
thousand
but
you
have
no
money
with
which
to
do
it
madame
in
this
satchel
i
can
see
only
a
few
five
percent
bonds
and
some
transfers
no
actual
cash
and
in
the
purse
a
mere
trifle
but
there
is
a
office
here
is
there
not
they
told
me
i
should
be
able
to
get
any
sort
of
paper
security
changed
quite
so
to
any
amount
you
please
but
you
will
lose
on
the
transaction
what
would
frighten
even
a
jew
rubbish
i
am
determined
to
retrieve
my
losses
take
me
away
and
call
those
fools
of
bearers
i
wheeled
the
chair
out
of
the
throng
and
the
bearers
making
their
appearance
we
left
the
casino
hurry
hurry
commanded
the
grandmother
show
me
the
nearest
way
to
the
is
it
far
a
couple
of
steps
madame
at
the
turning
from
the
square
into
the
avenue
we
came
face
to
face
with
the
whole
of
our
party
the
general
de
griers
mlle
blanche
and
her
mother
only
polina
and
astley
were
absent
well
well
well
exclaimed
the
grandmother
but
we
have
no
time
to
stop
what
do
you
want
i
ca
talk
to
you
here
i
dropped
behind
a
little
and
immediately
was
pounced
upon
by
de
griers
she
has
lost
this
morning
winnings
i
whispered
and
also
twelve
thousand
gulden
of
her
original
money
at
the
present
moment
we
are
going
to
get
some
bonds
changed
de
griers
stamped
his
foot
with
vexation
and
hastened
to
communicate
the
tidings
to
the
general
meanwhile
we
continued
to
wheel
the
old
lady
along
stop
her
stop
her
whispered
the
general
in
consternation
you
had
better
try
and
stop
her
yourself
i
returned
also
in
a
whisper
my
good
mother
he
said
as
he
approached
her
my
good
mother
pray
let
let
his
voice
was
beginning
to
tremble
and
sink
let
us
hire
a
carriage
and
go
for
a
drive
near
here
there
is
an
enchanting
view
to
be
obtained
were
just
coming
to
invite
you
to
go
and
see
it
begone
with
you
and
your
views
said
the
grandmother
angrily
as
she
waved
him
away
and
there
are
trees
there
and
we
could
have
tea
under
them
continued
the
general
now
in
utter
despair
nous
boirons
du
lait
sur
fraiche
added
de
griers
with
the
snarl
almost
of
a
wild
beast
du
lait
de
fraiche
the
idyll
the
ideal
of
the
parisian
bourgeois
his
whole
outlook
upon
la
nature
et
la
verite
have
done
with
you
and
your
milk
cried
the
old
lady
go
and
stuff
yourself
as
much
as
you
like
but
my
stomach
simply
recoils
from
the
idea
what
are
you
stopping
for
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
here
we
are
madame
i
announced
here
is
the
moneychanger
office
i
entered
to
get
the
securities
changed
while
the
grandmother
remained
outside
in
the
porch
and
the
rest
waited
at
a
little
distance
in
doubt
as
to
their
best
course
of
action
at
length
the
old
lady
turned
such
an
angry
stare
upon
them
that
they
departed
along
the
road
towards
the
casino
the
process
of
changing
involved
complicated
calculations
which
soon
necessitated
my
return
to
the
grandmother
for
instructions
the
thieves
she
exclaimed
as
she
clapped
her
hands
together
never
mind
though
get
the
documents
cashed
no
send
the
banker
out
to
me
she
added
as
an
afterthought
would
one
of
the
clerks
do
madame
yes
one
of
the
clerks
the
thieves
the
clerk
consented
to
come
out
when
he
perceived
that
he
was
being
asked
for
by
an
old
lady
who
was
too
infirm
to
walk
after
which
the
grandmother
began
to
upbraid
him
at
length
and
with
great
vehemence
for
his
alleged
usuriousness
and
to
bargain
with
him
in
a
mixture
of
russian
french
and
german
i
acting
as
interpreter
meanwhile
the
official
eyed
us
both
and
silently
nodded
his
head
at
the
grandmother
in
particular
he
gazed
with
a
curiosity
which
almost
bordered
upon
rudeness
at
length
too
he
smiled
pray
recollect
yourself
cried
the
old
lady
and
may
my
money
choke
you
alexis
ivanovitch
tell
him
that
we
can
easily
repair
to
someone
else
the
clerk
says
that
others
will
give
you
even
less
than
he
of
what
the
ultimate
calculations
consisted
i
do
not
exactly
remember
but
at
all
events
they
were
alarming
receiving
twelve
thousand
florins
in
gold
i
took
also
the
statement
of
accounts
and
carried
it
out
to
the
grandmother
well
well
she
said
i
am
no
accountant
let
us
hurry
away
hurry
away
and
she
waved
the
paper
aside
neither
upon
that
accursed
zero
however
nor
upon
that
equally
accursed
red
do
i
mean
to
stake
a
cent
i
muttered
to
myself
as
i
entered
the
casino
this
time
i
did
all
i
could
to
persuade
the
old
lady
to
stake
as
little
as
possible
saying
that
a
turn
would
come
in
the
chances
when
she
would
be
at
liberty
to
stake
more
but
she
was
so
impatient
that
though
at
first
she
agreed
to
do
as
i
suggested
nothing
could
stop
her
when
once
she
had
begun
by
way
of
prelude
she
won
stakes
of
a
hundred
and
two
hundred
gulden
there
you
are
she
said
as
she
nudged
me
see
what
we
have
won
surely
it
would
be
worth
our
while
to
stake
four
thousand
instead
of
a
hundred
for
we
might
win
another
four
thousand
and
then
oh
it
was
your
fault
before
all
your
fault
i
felt
greatly
put
out
as
i
watched
her
play
but
i
decided
to
hold
my
tongue
and
to
give
her
no
more
advice
suddenly
de
griers
appeared
on
the
scene
it
seemed
that
all
this
while
he
and
his
companions
had
been
standing
beside
us
though
i
noticed
that
mlle
blanche
had
withdrawn
a
little
from
the
rest
and
was
engaged
in
flirting
with
the
prince
clearly
the
general
was
greatly
put
out
at
this
indeed
he
was
in
a
perfect
agony
of
vexation
but
mlle
was
careful
never
to
look
his
way
though
he
did
his
best
to
attract
her
notice
poor
general
by
turns
his
face
blanched
and
reddened
and
he
was
trembling
to
such
an
extent
that
he
could
scarcely
follow
the
old
lady
play
at
length
mlle
and
the
prince
took
their
departure
and
the
general
followed
them
madame
madame
sounded
the
honeyed
accents
of
de
griers
as
he
leant
over
to
whisper
in
the
grandmother
ear
that
stake
will
never
win
no
no
it
is
impossible
he
added
in
russian
with
a
writhe
no
no
but
why
not
asked
the
grandmother
turning
round
show
me
what
i
ought
to
do
instantly
de
griers
burst
into
a
babble
of
french
as
he
advised
jumped
about
declared
that
such
and
such
chances
ought
to
be
waited
for
and
started
to
make
calculations
of
figures
all
this
he
addressed
to
me
in
my
capacity
as
translator
tapping
the
table
the
while
with
his
finger
and
pointing
hither
and
thither
at
length
he
seized
a
pencil
and
began
to
reckon
sums
on
paper
until
he
had
exhausted
the
patience
away
with
you
she
interrupted
you
talk
sheer
nonsense
for
though
you
keep
on
saying
madame
you
have
the
least
notion
what
ought
to
be
done
away
with
you
i
say
mais
madame
cooed
de
griers
and
straightway
started
afresh
with
his
fussy
instructions
stake
just
once
as
he
advises
the
grandmother
said
to
me
and
then
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
of
course
his
stake
might
win
as
a
matter
of
fact
de
grier
one
object
was
to
distract
the
old
lady
from
staking
large
sums
wherefore
he
now
suggested
to
her
that
she
should
stake
upon
certain
numbers
singly
and
in
groups
consequently
in
accordance
with
his
instructions
i
staked
a
piece
upon
several
odd
numbers
in
the
first
twenty
and
five
pieces
upon
certain
groups
of
of
from
twelve
to
eighteen
and
from
eighteen
to
the
total
staked
amounted
to
gulden
the
wheel
revolved
zero
cried
the
croupier
we
had
lost
it
all
the
fool
cried
the
old
lady
as
she
turned
upon
de
griers
you
infernal
frenchman
to
think
that
you
should
advise
away
with
you
though
you
fuss
and
fuss
you
do
even
know
what
you
talking
about
deeply
offended
de
griers
shrugged
his
shoulders
favoured
the
grandmother
with
a
look
of
contempt
and
departed
for
some
time
past
he
had
been
feeling
ashamed
of
being
seen
in
such
company
and
this
had
proved
the
last
straw
an
hour
later
we
had
lost
everything
in
hand
home
cried
the
grandmother
not
until
we
had
turned
into
the
avenue
did
she
utter
a
word
but
from
that
point
onwards
until
we
arrived
at
the
hotel
she
kept
venting
exclamations
of
what
a
fool
i
am
what
a
silly
old
fool
i
am
to
be
sure
arrived
at
the
hotel
she
called
for
tea
and
then
gave
orders
for
her
luggage
to
be
packed
we
are
off
again
she
announced
but
whither
madame
inquired
martha
what
business
is
that
of
yours
let
the
cricket
stick
to
its
hearth
the
russian
form
of
mind
your
own
business
potapitch

everything
packed
for
we
are
returning
to
moscow
at
once
i
have
fooled
away
fifteen
thousand
roubles
fifteen
thousand
roubles
good
mistress
my
god
and
potapitch
spat
upon
his
hands
probably
to
show
that
he
was
ready
to
serve
her
in
any
way
he
could
now
then
you
fool
at
once
you
begin
with
your
weeping
and
wailing
be
quiet
and
pack
also
run
downstairs
and
get
my
hotel
bill
the
next
train
leaves
at
madame
i
interposed
with
a
view
to
checking
her
agitation
and
what
is
the
time
now
eight
how
vexing
but
never
mind
alexis
ivanovitch
i
have
not
a
kopeck
left
i
have
but
these
two
bank
notes
please
run
to
the
office
and
get
them
changed
otherwise
i
shall
have
nothing
to
travel
with
departing
on
her
errand
i
returned
half
an
hour
later
to
find
the
whole
party
gathered
in
her
rooms
it
appeared
that
the
news
of
her
impending
departure
for
moscow
had
thrown
the
conspirators
into
consternation
even
greater
than
her
losses
had
done
for
said
they
even
if
her
departure
should
save
her
fortune
what
will
become
of
the
general
later
and
who
is
to
repay
de
griers
clearly
mlle
blanche
would
never
consent
to
wait
until
the
grandmother
was
dead
but
would
at
once
elope
with
the
prince
or
someone
else
so
they
had
all
gathered
together
endeavouring
to
calm
and
dissuade
the
grandmother
only
polina
was
absent
for
her
part
the
grandmother
had
nothing
for
the
party
but
abuse
away
with
you
you
rascals
she
was
shouting
what
have
my
affairs
to
do
with
you
why
in
particular
do
you
here
she
indicated
de
griers
come
sneaking
here
with
your
goat
beard
and
what
do
you
here
she
turned
to
mlle
blanche
want
of
me
what
are
you
finicking
for
diantre
muttered
mlle
under
her
breath
but
her
eyes
were
flashing
then
all
at
once
she
burst
into
a
laugh
and
left
the
room
crying
to
the
general
as
she
did
so
elle
vivra
cent
ans
so
you
have
been
counting
upon
my
death
have
you
fumed
the
old
lady
away
with
you
clear
them
out
of
the
room
alexis
ivanovitch
what
business
is
it
of
theirs
it
is
not
their
money
that
i
have
been
squandering
but
my
own
the
general
shrugged
his
shoulders
bowed
and
withdrew
with
de
griers
behind
him
call
prascovia
commanded
the
grandmother
and
in
five
minutes
martha
reappeared
with
polina
who
had
been
sitting
with
the
children
in
her
own
room
having
purposely
determined
not
to
leave
it
that
day
her
face
looked
grave
and
careworn
prascovia
began
the
grandmother
is
what
i
have
just
heard
through
a
side
wind
true
namely
that
this
fool
of
a
stepfather
of
yours
is
going
to
marry
that
silly
whirligig
of
a
frenchwoman
that
actress
or
something
worse
tell
me
is
it
true
i
do
not
know
for
certain
grandmamma
replied
polina
but
from
mlle
blanche
account
for
she
does
not
appear
to
think
it
necessary
to
conceal
anything
i
conclude
that
you
need
not
say
any
more
interrupted
the
grandmother
energetically
i
understand
the
situation
i
always
thought
we
should
get
something
like
this
from
him
for
i
always
looked
upon
him
as
a
futile
frivolous
fellow
who
gave
himself
unconscionable
airs
on
the
fact
of
his
being
a
general
though
he
only
became
one
because
he
retired
as
a
colonel
yes
i
know
all
about
the
sending
of
the
telegrams
to
inquire
whether
old
woman
is
likely
to
turn
up
her
toes
soon
ah
they
were
looking
for
the
legacies
without
money
that
wretched
woman
what
is
her
name
oh
de
cominges
would
never
dream
of
accepting
the
general
and
his
false
teeth
no
not
even
for
him
to
be
her
lacquey
since
she
herself
they
say
possesses
a
pile
of
money
and
lends
it
on
interest
and
makes
a
good
thing
out
of
it
however
it
is
not
you
prascovia
that
i
am
blaming
it
was
not
you
who
sent
those
telegrams
nor
for
that
matter
do
i
wish
to
recall
old
scores
true
i
know
that
you
are
a
vixen
by
nature
that
you
are
a
wasp
which
will
sting
one
if
one
touches
it
yet
my
heart
is
sore
for
you
for
i
loved
your
mother
katerina
now
will
you
leave
everything
here
and
come
away
with
me
otherwise
i
do
not
know
what
is
to
become
of
you
and
it
is
not
right
that
you
should
continue
living
with
these
people
nay
she
interposed
the
moment
that
polina
attempted
to
speak
i
have
not
yet
finished
i
ask
of
you
nothing
in
return
my
house
in
moscow
is
as
you
know
large
enough
for
a
palace
and
you
could
occupy
a
whole
floor
of
it
if
you
liked
and
keep
away
from
me
for
weeks
together
will
you
come
with
me
or
will
you
not
first
of
all
let
me
ask
of
you
replied
polina
whether
you
are
intending
to
depart
at
once
what
you
suppose
me
to
be
jesting
i
have
said
that
i
am
going
and
i
am
going
today
i
have
squandered
fifteen
thousand
roubles
at
that
accursed
roulette
of
yours
and
though
five
years
ago
i
promised
the
people
of
a
certain
suburb
of
moscow
to
build
them
a
stone
church
in
place
of
a
wooden
one
i
have
been
fooling
away
my
money
here
however
i
am
going
back
now
to
build
my
church
but
what
about
the
waters
grandmamma
surely
you
came
here
to
take
the
waters
you
and
your
waters
do
not
anger
me
prascovia
surely
you
are
trying
to
say
then
will
you
or
will
you
not
come
with
me
grandmamma
polina
replied
with
deep
feeling
i
am
very
very
grateful
to
you
for
the
shelter
which
you
have
so
kindly
offered
me
also
to
a
certain
extent
you
have
guessed
my
position
aright
and
i
am
beholden
to
you
to
such
an
extent
that
it
may
be
that
i
will
come
and
live
with
you
and
that
very
soon
yet
there
are
important
reasons
why
why
i
can
not
make
up
my
mind
just
yet
if
you
would
let
me
have
say
a
couple
of
weeks
to
decide
in
you
mean
that
you
are
not
coming
i
mean
only
that
i
can
not
come
just
yet
at
all
events
i
could
not
well
leave
my
little
brother
and
sister
here
since
since
if
i
were
to
leave
them
they
would
be
abandoned
altogether
but
if
grandmamma
you
would
take
the
little
ones
and
myself
then
of
course
i
could
come
with
you
and
would
do
all
i
could
to
serve
you
this
she
said
with
great
earnestness
only
without
the
little
ones
i
can
not
come
do
not
make
a
fuss
as
a
matter
of
fact
polina
never
at
any
time
either
fussed
or
wept
the
great
foster
father
translated
literally
the
great
poulterer
can
find
for
all
his
chicks
a
place
you
are
not
coming
without
the
children
but
see
here
prascovia
i
wish
you
well
and
nothing
but
well
yet
i
have
divined
the
reason
why
you
will
not
come
yes
i
know
all
prascovia
that
frenchman
will
never
bring
you
good
of
any
sort
polina
coloured
hotly
and
even
i
started
for
thought
i
to
myself
every
one
seems
to
know
about
that
affair
or
perhaps
i
am
the
only
one
who
does
not
know
about
it
now
now
do
not
frown
continued
the
grandmother
but
i
do
not
intend
to
slur
things
over
you
will
take
care
that
no
harm
befalls
you
will
you
not
for
you
are
a
girl
of
sense
and
i
am
sorry
for
you
i
regard
you
in
a
different
light
to
the
rest
of
them
and
now
please
leave
me
but
let
me
stay
with
you
a
little
longer
said
polina
no
replied
the
other
you
need
not
do
not
bother
me
for
you
and
all
of
them
have
tired
me
out
yet
when
polina
tried
to
kiss
the
grandmother
hand
the
old
lady
withdrew
it
and
herself
kissed
the
girl
on
the
cheek
as
she
passed
me
polina
gave
me
a
momentary
glance
and
then
as
swiftly
averted
her
eyes
and
to
you
also
alexis
ivanovitch
the
train
starts
in
an
hour
time
and
i
think
that
you
must
be
weary
of
me
take
these
five
hundred
gulden
for
yourself
i
thank
you
humbly
madame
but
i
am
ashamed
to
come
come
cried
the
grandmother
so
energetically
and
with
such
an
air
of
menace
that
i
did
not
dare
refuse
the
money
further
if
when
in
moscow
you
have
no
place
where
you
can
lay
your
head
she
added
come
and
see
me
and
i
will
give
you
a
recommendation
now
potapitch
get
things
ready
i
ascended
to
my
room
and
lay
down
upon
the
bed
a
whole
hour
i
must
have
lain
thus
with
my
head
resting
upon
my
hand
so
the
crisis
had
come
i
needed
time
for
its
consideration
i
would
have
a
talk
with
polina
ah
the
frenchman
so
it
was
true
but
how
could
it
be
so
polina
and
de
griers
what
a
combination
no
it
was
too
improbable
suddenly
i
leapt
up
with
the
idea
of
seeking
astley
and
forcing
him
to
speak
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
knew
more
than
i
did
astley
well
he
was
another
problem
for
me
to
solve
suddenly
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
i
opened
it
to
find
potapitch
awaiting
me
sir
he
said
my
mistress
is
asking
for
you
indeed
but
she
is
just
departing
is
she
not
the
train
leaves
in
ten
minutes
time
she
is
uneasy
sir
she
can
not
rest
come
quickly
sir
do
not
delay
i
ran
downstairs
at
once
the
grandmother
was
just
being
carried
out
of
her
rooms
into
the
corridor
in
her
hands
she
held
a
roll
of
alexis
ivanovitch
she
cried
walk
on
ahead
and
we
will
set
out
again
but
whither
madame
i
can
not
rest
until
i
have
retrieved
my
losses
march
on
ahead
and
ask
me
no
questions
play
continues
until
midnight
does
it
not
for
a
moment
i
stood
stupefied
stood
deep
in
thought
but
it
was
not
long
before
i
had
made
up
my
mind
with
your
leave
madame
i
said
i
will
not
go
with
you
and
why
not
what
do
you
mean
is
every
one
here
a
stupid
pardon
me
but
i
have
nothing
to
reproach
myself
with
i
merely
will
not
go
i
merely
intend
neither
to
witness
nor
to
join
in
your
play
i
also
beg
to
return
you
your
five
hundred
gulden
farewell
laying
the
money
upon
a
little
table
which
the
grandmother
chair
happened
to
be
passing
i
bowed
and
withdrew
what
folly
the
grandmother
shouted
after
me
very
well
then
do
not
come
and
i
will
find
my
way
alone
potapitch
you
must
come
with
me
lift
up
the
chair
and
carry
me
along
i
failed
to
find
astley
and
returned
home
it
was
now
growing
late
it
was
past
midnight
but
i
subsequently
learnt
from
potapitch
how
the
grandmother
day
had
ended
she
had
lost
all
the
money
which
earlier
in
the
day
i
had
got
for
her
paper
securities
a
sum
amounting
to
about
ten
thousand
roubles
this
she
did
under
the
direction
of
the
pole
whom
that
afternoon
she
had
dowered
with
two
pieces
but
before
his
arrival
on
the
scene
she
had
commanded
potapitch
to
stake
for
her
until
at
length
she
had
told
him
also
to
go
about
his
business
upon
that
the
pole
had
leapt
into
the
breach
not
only
did
it
happen
that
he
knew
the
russian
language
but
also
he
could
speak
a
mixture
of
three
different
dialects
so
that
the
pair
were
able
to
understand
one
another
yet
the
old
lady
never
ceased
to
abuse
him
despite
his
deferential
manner
and
to
compare
him
unfavourably
with
myself
so
at
all
events
potapitch
declared
you
the
old
chamberlain
said
to
me
treated
her
as
a
gentleman
should
but
he
he
robbed
her
right
and
left
as
i
could
see
with
my
own
eyes
twice
she
caught
him
at
it
and
rated
him
soundly
on
one
occasion
she
even
pulled
his
hair
so
that
the
bystanders
burst
out
laughing
yet
she
lost
everything
sir
that
is
to
say
she
lost
all
that
you
had
changed
for
her
then
we
brought
her
home
and
after
asking
for
some
water
and
saying
her
prayers
she
went
to
bed
so
worn
out
was
she
that
she
fell
asleep
at
once
may
god
send
her
dreams
of
angels
and
this
is
all
that
foreign
travel
has
done
for
us
oh
my
own
moscow
for
what
have
we
not
at
home
there
in
moscow
such
a
garden
and
flowers
as
you
could
never
see
here
and
fresh
air
and
coming
into
blossom
and
a
beautiful
view
to
look
upon
ah
but
what
must
she
do
but
go
travelling
abroad
alack
alack
xiii
almost
a
month
has
passed
since
i
last
touched
these
notes
notes
which
i
began
under
the
influence
of
impressions
at
once
poignant
and
disordered
the
crisis
which
i
then
felt
to
be
approaching
has
now
arrived
but
in
a
form
a
hundred
times
more
extensive
and
unexpected
than
i
had
looked
for
to
me
it
all
seems
strange
uncouth
and
tragic
certain
occurrences
have
befallen
me
which
border
upon
the
marvellous
at
all
events
that
is
how
i
view
them
i
view
them
so
in
one
regard
at
least
i
refer
to
the
whirlpool
of
events
in
which
at
the
time
i
was
revolving
but
the
most
curious
feature
of
all
is
my
relation
to
those
events
for
hitherto
i
had
never
clearly
understood
myself
yet
now
the
actual
crisis
has
passed
away
like
a
dream
even
my
passion
for
polina
is
dead
was
it
ever
so
strong
and
genuine
as
i
thought
if
so
what
has
become
of
it
now
at
times
i
fancy
that
i
must
be
mad
that
somewhere
i
am
sitting
in
a
madhouse
that
these
events
have
merely
seemed
to
happen
that
still
they
merely
seem
to
be
happening
i
have
been
arranging
and
my
notes
perhaps
for
the
purpose
of
convincing
myself
that
i
am
not
in
a
madhouse
at
present
i
am
lonely
and
alone
autumn
is
coming
already
it
is
mellowing
the
leaves
and
as
i
sit
brooding
in
this
melancholy
little
town
and
how
melancholy
the
little
towns
of
germany
can
be
i
find
myself
taking
no
thought
for
the
future
but
living
under
the
influence
of
passing
moods
and
of
my
recollections
of
the
tempest
which
recently
drew
me
into
its
vortex
and
then
cast
me
out
again
at
times
i
seem
still
to
be
caught
within
that
vortex
at
times
the
tempest
seems
once
more
to
be
gathering
and
as
it
passes
overhead
to
be
wrapping
me
in
its
folds
until
i
have
lost
my
sense
of
order
and
reality
and
continue
whirling
and
whirling
and
whirling
around
yet
it
may
be
that
i
shall
be
able
to
stop
myself
from
revolving
if
once
i
can
succeed
in
rendering
myself
an
exact
account
of
what
has
happened
within
the
month
just
past
somehow
i
feel
drawn
towards
the
pen
on
many
and
many
an
evening
i
have
had
nothing
else
in
the
world
to
do
but
curiously
enough
of
late
i
have
taken
to
amusing
myself
with
the
works
of
paul
de
kock
which
i
read
in
german
translations
obtained
from
a
wretched
local
library
these
works
i
can
not
abide
yet
i
read
them
and
find
myself
marvelling
that
i
should
be
doing
so
somehow
i
seem
to
be
afraid
of
any
serious
book
afraid
of
permitting
any
serious
preoccupation
to
break
the
spell
of
the
passing
moment
so
dear
to
me
is
the
formless
dream
of
which
i
have
spoken
so
dear
to
me
are
the
impressions
which
it
has
left
behind
it
that
i
fear
to
touch
the
vision
with
anything
new
lest
it
should
dissolve
in
smoke
but
is
it
so
dear
to
me
yes
it
is
dear
to
me
and
will
ever
be
fresh
in
my
recollections
even
forty
years
hence
so
let
me
write
of
it
but
only
partially
and
in
a
more
abridged
form
than
my
full
impressions
might
warrant
first
of
all
let
me
conclude
the
history
of
the
grandmother
next
day
she
lost
every
gulden
that
she
possessed
things
were
bound
to
happen
so
for
persons
of
her
type
who
have
once
entered
upon
that
road
descend
it
with
rapidity
even
as
a
sledge
descends
a
all
day
until
eight
that
evening
did
she
play
and
though
i
personally
did
not
witness
her
exploits
i
learnt
of
them
later
through
report
all
that
day
potapitch
remained
in
attendance
upon
her
but
the
poles
who
directed
her
play
she
changed
more
than
once
as
a
beginning
she
dismissed
her
pole
of
the
previous
day
the
pole
whose
hair
she
had
pulled
and
took
to
herself
another
one
but
the
latter
proved
worse
even
than
the
former
and
incurred
dismissal
in
favour
of
the
first
pole
who
during
the
time
of
his
unemployment
had
nevertheless
hovered
around
the
grandmother
chair
and
from
time
to
time
obtruded
his
head
over
her
shoulder
at
length
the
old
lady
became
desperate
for
the
second
pole
when
dismissed
imitated
his
predecessor
by
declining
to
go
away
with
the
result
that
one
pole
remained
standing
on
the
right
of
the
victim
and
the
other
on
her
left
from
which
vantage
points
the
pair
quarrelled
abused
each
other
concerning
the
stakes
and
rounds
and
exchanged
the
epithet
laidak
rascal
and
other
polish
terms
of
endearment
finally
they
effected
a
mutual
reconciliation
and
tossing
the
money
about
anyhow
played
simply
at
random
once
more
quarrelling
each
of
them
staked
money
on
his
own
side
of
the
grandmother
chair
for
instance
the
one
pole
staked
upon
the
red
and
the
other
one
upon
the
black
until
they
had
so
confused
and
browbeaten
the
old
lady
that
nearly
weeping
she
was
forced
to
appeal
to
the
head
croupier
for
protection
and
to
have
the
two
poles
expelled
no
time
was
lost
in
this
being
done
despite
the
cries
and
protestations
that
the
old
lady
was
in
their
debt
that
she
had
cheated
them
and
that
her
general
behaviour
had
been
mean
and
dishonourable
the
same
evening
the
unfortunate
potapitch
related
the
story
to
me
with
tears
complaining
that
the
two
men
had
filled
their
pockets
with
money
he
himself
had
seen
them
do
it
which
had
been
shamelessly
pilfered
from
his
mistress
for
instance
one
pole
demanded
of
the
grandmother
fifty
gulden
for
his
trouble
and
then
staked
the
money
by
the
side
of
her
stake
she
happened
to
win
whereupon
he
cried
out
that
the
winning
stake
was
his
and
hers
the
loser
as
soon
as
the
two
poles
had
been
expelled
potapitch
left
the
room
and
reported
to
the
authorities
that
the
men
pockets
were
full
of
gold
and
on
the
grandmother
also
requesting
the
head
croupier
to
look
into
the
affair
the
police
made
their
appearance
and
despite
the
protests
of
the
poles
who
indeed
had
been
caught
redhanded
their
pockets
were
turned
inside
out
and
the
contents
handed
over
to
the
grandmother
in
fact
in
view
of
the
circumstance
that
she
lost
all
day
the
croupiers
and
other
authorities
of
the
casino
showed
her
every
attention
and
on
her
fame
spreading
through
the
town
visitors
of
every
nationality
even
the
most
knowing
of
them
the
most
distinguished
crowded
to
get
a
glimpse
of
la
vieille
comtesse
russe
tombee
en
enfance
who
had
lost
so
many
millions
yet
with
the
money
which
the
authorities
restored
to
her
from
the
pockets
of
the
poles
the
grandmother
effected
very
very
little
for
there
soon
arrived
to
take
his
countrymen
place
a
third
pole
a
man
who
could
speak
russian
fluently
was
dressed
like
a
gentleman
albeit
in
lacqueyish
fashion
and
sported
a
huge
moustache
though
polite
enough
to
the
old
lady
he
took
a
high
hand
with
the
bystanders
in
short
he
offered
himself
less
as
a
servant
than
as
an
entertainer
after
each
round
he
would
turn
to
the
old
lady
and
swear
terrible
oaths
to
the
effect
that
he
was
a
polish
gentleman
of
honour
who
would
scorn
to
take
a
kopeck
of
her
money
and
though
he
repeated
these
oaths
so
often
that
at
length
she
grew
alarmed
he
had
her
play
in
hand
and
began
to
win
on
her
behalf
wherefore
she
felt
that
she
could
not
well
get
rid
of
him
an
hour
later
the
two
poles
who
earlier
in
the
day
had
been
expelled
from
the
casino
made
a
reappearance
behind
the
old
lady
chair
and
renewed
their
offers
of
service
even
if
it
were
only
to
be
sent
on
messages
but
from
potapitch
i
subsequently
had
it
that
between
these
rascals
and
the
said
gentleman
of
honour
there
passed
a
wink
as
well
as
that
the
latter
put
something
into
their
hands
next
since
the
grandmother
had
not
yet
lunched
she
had
scarcely
for
a
moment
left
her
chair
one
of
the
two
poles
ran
to
the
restaurant
of
the
casino
and
brought
her
thence
a
cup
of
soup
and
afterwards
some
tea
in
fact
both
the
poles
hastened
to
perform
this
office
finally
towards
the
close
of
the
day
when
it
was
clear
that
the
grandmother
was
about
to
play
her
last
there
could
be
seen
standing
behind
her
chair
no
fewer
than
six
natives
of
poland
persons
who
as
yet
had
been
neither
audible
nor
visible
and
as
soon
as
ever
the
old
lady
played
the
note
in
question
they
took
no
further
notice
of
her
but
pushed
their
way
past
her
chair
to
the
table
seized
the
money
and
staked
it
shouting
and
disputing
the
while
and
arguing
with
the
gentleman
of
honour
who
also
had
forgotten
the
grandmother
existence
as
though
he
were
their
equal
even
when
the
grandmother
had
lost
her
all
and
was
returning
about
eight
to
the
hotel
some
three
or
four
poles
could
not
bring
themselves
to
leave
her
but
went
on
running
beside
her
chair
and
volubly
protesting
that
the
grandmother
had
cheated
them
and
that
she
ought
to
be
made
to
surrender
what
was
not
her
own
thus
the
party
arrived
at
the
hotel
whence
presently
the
gang
of
rascals
was
ejected
neck
and
crop
according
to
potapitch
calculations
the
grandmother
lost
that
day
a
total
of
ninety
thousand
roubles
in
addition
to
the
money
which
she
had
lost
the
day
before
every
paper
security
which
she
had
brought
with
her
five
percent
bonds
internal
loan
scrip
and
what
not
she
had
changed
into
cash
also
i
could
not
but
marvel
at
the
way
in
which
for
seven
or
eight
hours
at
a
stretch
she
sat
in
that
chair
of
hers
almost
never
leaving
the
table
again
potapitch
told
me
that
there
were
three
occasions
on
which
she
really
began
to
win
but
that
led
on
by
false
hopes
she
was
unable
to
tear
herself
away
at
the
right
moment
every
gambler
knows
how
a
person
may
sit
a
day
and
a
night
at
cards
without
ever
casting
a
glance
to
right
or
to
left
meanwhile
that
day
some
other
very
important
events
were
passing
in
our
hotel
as
early
as
eleven
that
is
to
say
before
the
grandmother
had
quitted
her
rooms
the
general
and
de
griers
decided
upon
their
last
stroke
in
other
words
on
learning
that
the
old
lady
had
changed
her
mind
about
departing
and
was
bent
on
setting
out
for
the
casino
again
the
whole
of
our
gang
polina
only
excepted
proceeded
en
masse
to
her
rooms
for
the
purpose
of
finally
and
frankly
treating
with
her
but
the
general
quaking
and
greatly
apprehensive
as
to
his
possible
future
overdid
things
after
half
an
hour
prayers
and
entreaties
coupled
with
a
full
confession
of
his
debts
and
even
of
his
passion
for
mlle
blanche
yes
he
had
quite
lost
his
head
he
suddenly
adopted
a
tone
of
menace
and
started
to
rage
at
the
old
lady
exclaiming
that
she
was
sullying
the
family
honour
that
she
was
making
a
public
scandal
of
herself
and
that
she
was
smirching
the
fair
name
of
russia
the
upshot
was
that
the
grandmother
turned
him
out
of
the
room
with
her
stick
it
was
a
real
stick
too
later
in
the
morning
he
held
several
consultations
with
de
griers
the
question
which
occupied
him
being
is
it
in
any
way
possible
to
make
use
of
the
police
to
tell
them
that
this
respected
but
unfortunate
old
lady
has
gone
out
of
her
mind
and
is
squandering
her
last
kopeck
or
something
of
the
kind
in
short
is
it
in
any
way
possible
to
engineer
a
species
of
supervision
over
or
of
restraint
upon
the
old
lady
de
griers
however
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
this
and
laughed
in
the
general
face
while
the
old
warrior
went
on
chattering
volubly
and
running
up
and
down
his
study
finally
de
griers
waved
his
hand
and
disappeared
from
view
and
by
evening
it
became
known
that
he
had
left
the
hotel
after
holding
a
very
secret
and
important
conference
with
mlle
blanche
as
for
the
latter
from
early
morning
she
had
taken
decisive
measures
by
completely
excluding
the
general
from
her
presence
and
bestowing
upon
him
not
a
glance
indeed
even
when
the
general
pursued
her
to
the
casino
and
met
her
walking
arm
in
arm
with
the
prince
he
the
general
received
from
her
and
her
mother
not
the
slightest
recognition
nor
did
the
prince
himself
bow
the
rest
of
the
day
mlle
spent
in
probing
the
prince
and
trying
to
make
him
declare
himself
but
in
this
she
made
a
woeful
mistake
the
little
incident
occurred
in
the
evening
suddenly
mlle
blanche
realised
that
the
prince
had
not
even
a
copper
to
his
name
but
on
the
contrary
was
minded
to
borrow
of
her
money
wherewith
to
play
at
roulette
in
high
displeasure
she
drove
him
from
her
presence
and
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
the
same
morning
i
went
to
see
or
rather
to
look
for
astley
but
was
unsuccessful
in
my
quest
neither
in
his
rooms
nor
in
the
casino
nor
in
the
park
was
he
to
be
found
nor
did
he
that
day
lunch
at
his
hotel
as
usual
however
at
about
five
i
caught
sight
of
him
walking
from
the
railway
station
to
the
hotel
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
great
hurry
and
much
preoccupied
though
in
his
face
i
could
discern
no
actual
traces
of
worry
or
perturbation
he
held
out
to
me
a
friendly
hand
with
his
usual
ejaculation
of
ah
but
did
not
check
his
stride
i
turned
and
walked
beside
him
but
found
somehow
that
his
answers
forbade
any
putting
of
definite
questions
moreover
i
felt
reluctant
to
speak
to
him
of
polina
nor
for
his
part
did
he
ask
me
any
questions
concerning
her
although
on
my
telling
him
of
the
grandmother
exploits
he
listened
attentively
and
gravely
and
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
she
is
gambling
away
everything
that
she
has
i
remarked
indeed
she
arrived
at
the
casino
even
before
i
had
taken
my
departure
by
train
so
i
knew
she
had
been
playing
if
i
should
have
time
i
will
go
to
the
casino
and
take
a
look
at
her
the
thing
interests
me
where
have
you
been
today
i
asked
surprised
at
myself
for
having
as
yet
omitted
to
put
to
him
that
question
to
frankfort
on
business
on
business
what
more
was
there
to
be
asked
after
that
i
accompanied
him
until
as
we
drew
level
with
the
hotel
des
quatre
saisons
he
suddenly
nodded
to
me
and
disappeared
for
myself
i
returned
home
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
even
had
i
met
him
at
two
in
the
afternoon
i
should
have
learnt
no
more
from
him
than
i
had
done
at
five
for
the
reason
that
i
had
no
definite
question
to
ask
it
was
bound
to
have
been
so
for
me
to
formulate
the
query
which
i
really
wished
to
put
was
a
simple
impossibility
polina
spent
the
whole
of
that
day
either
in
walking
about
the
park
with
the
nurse
and
children
or
in
sitting
in
her
own
room
for
a
long
while
past
she
had
avoided
the
general
and
had
scarcely
had
a
word
to
say
to
him
scarcely
a
word
i
mean
on
any
serious
topic
yes
that
i
had
noticed
still
even
though
i
was
aware
of
the
position
in
which
the
general
was
placed
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
that
he
would
have
any
reason
to
avoid
her
or
to
trouble
her
with
family
explanations
indeed
when
i
was
returning
to
the
hotel
after
my
conversation
with
astley
and
chanced
to
meet
polina
and
the
children
i
could
see
that
her
face
was
as
calm
as
though
the
family
disturbances
had
never
touched
her
to
my
salute
she
responded
with
a
slight
bow
and
i
retired
to
my
room
in
a
very
bad
humour
of
course
since
the
affair
with
the
burmergelms
i
had
exchanged
not
a
word
with
polina
nor
had
with
her
any
kind
of
intercourse
yet
i
had
been
at
my
wits
end
for
as
time
went
on
there
was
arising
in
me
an
dissatisfaction
even
if
she
did
not
love
me
she
ought
not
to
have
trampled
upon
my
feelings
nor
to
have
accepted
my
confessions
with
such
contempt
seeing
that
she
must
have
been
aware
that
i
loved
her
of
her
own
accord
she
had
allowed
me
to
tell
her
as
much
of
course
the
situation
between
us
had
arisen
in
a
curious
manner
about
two
months
ago
i
had
noticed
that
she
had
a
desire
to
make
me
her
friend
her
confidant
that
she
was
making
trial
of
me
for
the
purpose
but
for
some
reason
or
another
the
desired
result
had
never
come
about
and
we
had
fallen
into
the
present
strange
relations
which
had
led
me
to
address
her
as
i
had
done
at
the
same
time
if
my
love
was
distasteful
to
her
why
had
she
not
forbidden
me
to
speak
of
it
to
her
but
she
had
not
so
forbidden
me
on
the
contrary
there
had
been
occasions
when
she
had
even
invited
me
to
speak
of
course
this
might
have
been
done
out
of
sheer
wantonness
for
i
well
knew
i
had
remarked
it
only
too
often
that
after
listening
to
what
i
had
to
say
and
angering
me
almost
beyond
endurance
she
loved
suddenly
to
torture
me
with
some
fresh
outburst
of
contempt
and
aloofness
yet
she
must
have
known
that
i
could
not
live
without
her
three
days
had
elapsed
since
the
affair
with
the
baron
and
i
could
bear
the
severance
no
longer
when
that
afternoon
i
met
her
near
the
casino
my
heart
almost
made
me
faint
it
beat
so
violently
she
too
could
not
live
without
me
for
had
she
not
said
that
she
had
need
of
me
or
had
that
too
been
spoken
in
jest
that
she
had
a
secret
of
some
kind
there
could
be
no
doubt
what
she
had
said
to
the
grandmother
had
stabbed
me
to
the
heart
on
a
thousand
occasions
i
had
challenged
her
to
be
open
with
me
nor
could
she
have
been
ignorant
that
i
was
ready
to
give
my
very
life
for
her
yet
always
she
had
kept
me
at
a
distance
with
that
contemptuous
air
of
hers
or
else
she
had
demanded
of
me
in
lieu
of
the
life
which
i
offered
to
lay
at
her
feet
such
escapades
as
i
had
perpetrated
with
the
baron
ah
was
it
not
torture
to
me
all
this
for
could
it
be
that
her
whole
world
was
bound
up
with
the
frenchman
what
too
about
astley
the
affair
was
inexplicable
throughout
my
god
what
distress
it
caused
me
arrived
home
i
in
a
fit
of
frenzy
indited
the
following
polina
alexandrovna
i
can
see
that
there
is
approaching
us
an
exposure
which
will
involve
you
too
for
the
last
time
i
ask
of
you
have
you
or
have
you
not
any
need
of
my
life
if
you
have
then
make
such
dispositions
as
you
wish
and
i
shall
always
be
discoverable
in
my
room
if
required
if
you
have
need
of
my
life
write
or
send
for
me
i
sealed
the
letter
and
dispatched
it
by
the
hand
of
a
corridor
lacquey
with
orders
to
hand
it
to
the
addressee
in
person
though
i
expected
no
answer
scarcely
three
minutes
had
elapsed
before
the
lacquey
returned
with
the
compliments
of
a
certain
person
next
about
seven
i
was
sent
for
by
the
general
i
found
him
in
his
study
apparently
preparing
to
go
out
again
for
his
hat
and
stick
were
lying
on
the
sofa
when
i
entered
he
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
his
feet
wide
apart
and
his
head
bent
down
also
he
appeared
to
be
talking
to
himself
but
as
soon
as
ever
he
saw
me
at
the
door
he
came
towards
me
in
such
a
curious
manner
that
involuntarily
i
retreated
a
step
and
was
for
leaving
the
room
whereupon
he
seized
me
by
both
hands
and
drawing
me
towards
the
sofa
and
seating
himself
thereon
he
forced
me
to
sit
down
on
a
chair
opposite
him
then
without
letting
go
of
my
hands
he
exclaimed
with
quivering
lips
and
a
sparkle
of
tears
on
his
eyelashes
oh
alexis
ivanovitch
save
me
save
me
have
some
mercy
upon
me
for
a
long
time
i
could
not
make
out
what
he
meant
although
he
kept
talking
and
talking
and
constantly
repeating
to
himself
have
mercy
mercy
at
length
however
i
divined
that
he
was
expecting
me
to
give
him
something
in
the
nature
of
advice
or
rather
that
deserted
by
every
one
and
overwhelmed
with
grief
and
apprehension
he
had
bethought
himself
of
my
existence
and
sent
for
me
to
relieve
his
feelings
by
talking
and
talking
and
talking
in
fact
he
was
in
such
a
confused
and
despondent
state
of
mind
that
clasping
his
hands
together
he
actually
went
down
upon
his
knees
and
begged
me
to
go
to
mlle
blanche
and
beseech
and
advise
her
to
return
to
him
and
to
accept
him
in
marriage
but
general
i
exclaimed
possibly
mlle
blanche
has
scarcely
even
remarked
my
existence
what
could
i
do
with
her
it
was
in
vain
that
i
protested
for
he
could
understand
nothing
that
was
said
to
him
next
he
started
talking
about
the
grandmother
but
always
in
a
disconnected
sort
of
fashion
his
one
thought
being
to
send
for
the
police
in
russia
said
he
suddenly
boiling
over
with
indignation
or
in
any
state
where
there
exists
a
government
old
women
like
my
mother
are
placed
under
proper
guardianship
yes
my
good
sir
he
went
on
relapsing
into
a
scolding
tone
as
he
leapt
to
his
feet
and
started
to
pace
the
room
do
you
not
know
this
he
seemed
to
be
addressing
some
imaginary
auditor
in
the
corner
do
you
not
know
this
that
in
russia
old
women
like
her
are
subjected
to
restraint
the
devil
take
them
again
he
threw
himself
down
upon
the
sofa
a
minute
later
though
sobbing
and
almost
breathless
he
managed
to
gasp
out
that
mlle
blanche
had
refused
to
marry
him
for
the
reason
that
the
grandmother
had
turned
up
in
place
of
a
telegram
and
it
was
therefore
clear
that
he
had
no
inheritance
to
look
for
evidently
he
supposed
that
i
had
hitherto
been
in
entire
ignorance
of
all
this
again
when
i
referred
to
de
griers
the
general
made
a
gesture
of
despair
he
has
gone
away
he
said
and
everything
which
i
possess
is
mortgaged
to
him
i
stand
stripped
to
my
skin
even
of
the
money
which
you
brought
me
from
paris
i
know
not
if
seven
hundred
francs
be
left
of
course
that
sum
will
do
to
go
on
with
but
as
regards
the
future
i
know
nothing
i
know
nothing
then
how
will
you
pay
your
hotel
bill
i
cried
in
consternation
and
what
shall
you
do
afterwards
he
looked
at
me
vaguely
but
it
was
clear
that
he
had
not
understood
perhaps
had
not
even
heard
my
questions
then
i
tried
to
get
him
to
speak
of
polina
and
the
children
but
he
only
returned
brief
answers
of
yes
yes
and
again
started
to
maunder
about
the
prince
and
the
likelihood
of
the
latter
marrying
mlle
blanche
what
on
earth
am
i
to
do
he
concluded
what
on
earth
am
i
to
do
is
this
not
ingratitude
is
it
not
sheer
ingratitude
and
he
burst
into
tears
nothing
could
be
done
with
such
a
man
yet
to
leave
him
alone
was
dangerous
for
something
might
happen
to
him
i
withdrew
from
his
rooms
for
a
little
while
but
warned
the
nursemaid
to
keep
an
eye
upon
him
as
well
as
exchanged
a
word
with
the
corridor
lacquey
a
very
talkative
fellow
who
likewise
promised
to
remain
on
the
hardly
had
i
left
the
general
when
potapitch
approached
me
with
a
summons
from
the
grandmother
it
was
now
eight
and
she
had
returned
from
the
casino
after
finally
losing
all
that
she
possessed
i
found
her
sitting
in
her
chair
much
distressed
and
evidently
fatigued
presently
martha
brought
her
up
a
cup
of
tea
and
forced
her
to
drink
it
yet
even
then
i
could
detect
in
the
old
lady
tone
and
manner
a
great
change
good
evening
alexis
ivanovitch
she
said
slowly
with
her
head
drooping
pardon
me
for
disturbing
you
again
yes
you
must
pardon
an
old
old
woman
like
myself
for
i
have
left
behind
me
all
that
i
possess
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
you
did
quite
right
in
declining
to
come
with
me
this
evening
now
i
am
without
money
without
a
single
groat
but
i
must
not
delay
a
moment
i
must
leave
by
the
train
i
have
sent
for
that
english
friend
of
yours
and
am
going
to
beg
of
him
three
thousand
francs
for
a
week
please
try
and
persuade
him
to
think
nothing
of
it
nor
yet
to
refuse
me
for
i
am
still
a
rich
woman
who
possesses
three
villages
and
a
couple
of
mansions
yes
the
money
shall
be
found
for
i
have
not
yet
squandered
everything
i
tell
you
this
in
order
that
he
may
have
no
doubts
about
ah
but
here
he
is
clearly
he
is
a
good
fellow
true
enough
astley
had
come
on
receiving
the
appeal
scarcely
stopping
even
to
reflect
and
with
scarcely
a
word
he
counted
out
the
three
thousand
francs
under
a
note
of
hand
which
she
duly
signed
then
his
business
done
he
bowed
and
lost
no
time
in
taking
his
departure
you
too
leave
me
alexis
ivanovitch
said
the
grandmother
all
my
bones
are
aching
and
i
still
have
an
hour
in
which
to
rest
do
not
be
hard
upon
me
old
fool
that
i
am
never
again
shall
i
blame
young
people
for
being
frivolous
i
should
think
it
wrong
even
to
blame
that
unhappy
general
of
yours
nevertheless
i
do
not
mean
to
let
him
have
any
of
my
money
which
is
all
that
he
desires
for
the
reason
that
i
look
upon
him
as
a
perfect
blockhead
and
consider
myself
simpleton
though
i
be
at
least
wiser
than
he
is
how
surely
does
god
visit
old
age
and
punish
it
for
its
presumption
well
martha
come
and
lift
me
up
however
i
had
a
mind
to
see
the
old
lady
off
and
moreover
i
was
in
an
expectant
frame
of
mind
somehow
i
kept
thinking
that
something
was
going
to
happen
wherefore
i
could
not
rest
quietly
in
my
room
but
stepped
out
into
the
corridor
and
then
into
the
chestnut
avenue
for
a
few
minutes
stroll
my
letter
to
polina
had
been
clear
and
firm
and
in
the
present
crisis
i
felt
sure
would
prove
final
i
had
heard
of
de
griers
departure
and
however
much
polina
might
reject
me
as
a
friend
she
might
not
reject
me
altogether
as
a
servant
she
would
need
me
to
fetch
and
carry
for
her
and
i
was
ready
to
do
so
how
could
it
have
been
otherwise
towards
the
hour
of
the
train
departure
i
hastened
to
the
station
and
put
the
grandmother
into
her
compartment
she
and
her
party
occupying
a
reserved
family
saloon
thanks
for
your
disinterested
assistance
she
said
at
parting
oh
and
please
remind
prascovia
of
what
i
said
to
her
last
night
i
expect
soon
to
see
her
then
i
returned
home
as
i
was
passing
the
door
of
the
general
suite
i
met
the
nursemaid
and
inquired
after
her
master
there
is
nothing
new
to
report
sir
she
replied
quietly
nevertheless
i
decided
to
enter
and
was
just
doing
so
when
i
halted
thunderstruck
on
the
threshold
for
before
me
i
beheld
the
general
and
mlle
blanche
laughing
gaily
at
one
another
while
beside
them
on
the
sofa
there
was
seated
her
mother
clearly
the
general
was
almost
out
of
his
mind
with
joy
for
he
was
talking
all
sorts
of
nonsense
and
bubbling
over
with
a
nervous
laugh
a
laugh
which
twisted
his
face
into
innumerable
wrinkles
and
caused
his
eyes
almost
to
disappear
afterwards
i
learnt
from
mlle
blanche
herself
that
after
dismissing
the
prince
and
hearing
of
the
general
tears
she
bethought
her
of
going
to
comfort
the
old
man
and
had
just
arrived
for
the
purpose
when
i
entered
fortunately
the
poor
general
did
not
know
that
his
fate
had
been
decided
that
mlle
had
long
ago
packed
her
trunks
in
readiness
for
the
first
morning
train
to
paris
hesitating
a
moment
on
the
threshold
i
changed
my
mind
as
to
entering
and
departed
unnoticed
ascending
to
my
own
room
and
opening
the
door
i
perceived
in
the
a
figure
seated
on
a
chair
in
the
corner
by
the
window
the
figure
did
not
rise
when
i
entered
so
i
approached
it
swiftly
peered
at
it
closely
and
felt
my
heart
almost
stop
beating
the
figure
was
polina
xiv
the
shock
made
me
utter
an
exclamation
what
is
the
matter
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
in
a
strange
voice
she
was
looking
pale
and
her
eyes
were
dim
what
is
the
matter
i
why
the
fact
that
you
are
here
if
i
am
here
i
have
come
with
all
that
i
have
to
bring
she
said
such
has
always
been
my
way
as
you
shall
presently
see
please
light
a
candle
i
did
so
whereupon
she
rose
approached
the
table
and
laid
upon
it
an
open
letter
read
it
she
added
it
is
de
griers
handwriting
i
cried
as
i
seized
the
document
my
hands
were
so
tremulous
that
the
lines
on
the
pages
danced
before
my
eyes
although
at
this
distance
of
time
i
have
forgotten
the
exact
phraseology
of
the
missive
i
append
if
not
the
precise
words
at
all
events
the
general
sense
mademoiselle
the
document
ran
certain
untoward
circumstances
compel
me
to
depart
in
haste
of
course
you
have
of
yourself
remarked
that
hitherto
i
have
always
refrained
from
having
any
final
explanation
with
you
for
the
reason
that
i
could
not
well
state
the
whole
circumstances
and
now
to
my
difficulties
the
advent
of
the
aged
grandmother
coupled
with
her
subsequent
proceedings
has
put
the
final
touch
also
the
involved
state
of
my
affairs
forbids
me
to
write
with
any
finality
concerning
those
hopes
of
ultimate
bliss
upon
which
for
a
long
while
past
i
have
permitted
myself
to
feed
i
regret
the
past
but
at
the
same
time
hope
that
in
my
conduct
you
have
never
been
able
to
detect
anything
that
was
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
honour
having
lost
however
almost
the
whole
of
my
money
in
debts
incurred
by
your
stepfather
i
find
myself
driven
to
the
necessity
of
saving
the
remainder
wherefore
i
have
instructed
certain
friends
of
mine
in
petersburg
to
arrange
for
the
sale
of
all
the
property
which
has
been
mortgaged
to
myself
at
the
same
time
knowing
that
in
addition
your
frivolous
stepfather
has
squandered
money
which
is
exclusively
yours
i
have
decided
to
absolve
him
from
a
certain
moiety
of
the
mortgages
on
his
property
in
order
that
you
may
be
in
a
position
to
recover
of
him
what
you
have
lost
by
suing
him
in
legal
fashion
i
trust
therefore
that
as
matters
now
stand
this
action
of
mine
may
bring
you
some
advantage
i
trust
also
that
this
same
action
leaves
me
in
the
position
of
having
fulfilled
every
obligation
which
is
incumbent
upon
a
man
of
honour
and
refinement
rest
assured
that
your
memory
will
for
ever
remain
graven
in
my
heart
all
this
is
clear
enough
i
commented
surely
you
did
not
expect
aught
else
from
him
somehow
i
was
feeling
annoyed
i
expected
nothing
at
all
from
him
she
replied
quietly
enough
to
all
outward
seeming
yet
with
a
note
of
irritation
in
her
tone
long
ago
i
made
up
my
mind
on
the
subject
for
i
could
read
his
thoughts
and
knew
what
he
was
thinking
he
thought
that
possibly
i
should
sue
him
that
one
day
i
might
become
a
nuisance
here
polina
halted
for
a
moment
and
stood
biting
her
lips
so
of
set
purpose
i
redoubled
my
contemptuous
treatment
of
him
and
waited
to
see
what
he
would
do
if
a
telegram
to
say
that
we
had
become
legatees
had
arrived
from
petersburg
i
should
have
flung
at
him
a
quittance
for
my
foolish
stepfather
debts
and
then
dismissed
him
for
a
long
time
i
have
hated
him
even
in
earlier
days
he
was
not
a
man
and
now
oh
how
gladly
i
could
throw
those
fifty
thousand
roubles
in
his
face
and
spit
in
it
and
then
rub
the
spittle
in
but
the
document
returning
the
rouble
mortgage
has
the
general
got
it
if
so
possess
yourself
of
it
and
send
it
to
de
griers
no
no
the
general
has
not
got
it
just
as
i
expected
well
what
is
the
general
going
to
do
then
an
idea
suddenly
occurred
to
me
what
about
the
grandmother
i
asked
polina
looked
at
me
with
impatience
and
bewilderment
what
makes
you
speak
of
her
was
her
irritable
inquiry
i
can
not
go
and
live
with
her
nor
she
added
hotly
will
i
go
down
upon
my
knees
to
any
one
why
should
you
i
cried
yet
to
think
that
you
should
have
loved
de
griers
the
villain
the
villain
but
i
will
kill
him
in
a
duel
where
is
he
now
in
frankfort
where
he
will
be
staying
for
the
next
three
days
well
bid
me
do
so
and
i
will
go
to
him
by
the
first
train
tomorrow
i
exclaimed
with
enthusiasm
she
smiled
if
you
were
to
do
that
she
said
he
would
merely
tell
you
to
be
so
good
as
first
to
return
him
the
fifty
thousand
francs
what
then
would
be
the
use
of
having
a
quarrel
with
him
you
talk
sheer
nonsense
i
ground
my
teeth
the
question
i
went
on
is
how
to
raise
the
fifty
thousand
francs
we
can
not
expect
to
find
them
lying
about
on
the
floor
listen
what
of
mr
astley
even
as
i
spoke
a
new
and
strange
idea
formed
itself
in
my
brain
her
eyes
flashed
fire
what
you
yourself
wish
me
to
leave
you
for
him
she
cried
with
a
scornful
look
and
a
proud
smile
never
before
had
she
addressed
me
thus
then
her
head
must
have
turned
dizzy
with
emotion
for
suddenly
she
seated
herself
upon
the
sofa
as
though
she
were
powerless
any
longer
to
stand
a
flash
of
lightning
seemed
to
strike
me
as
i
stood
there
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
eyes
or
my
ears
she
did
love
me
then
it
was
to
me
and
not
to
astley
that
she
had
turned
although
she
an
unprotected
girl
had
come
to
me
in
my
room
in
an
hotel
room
and
had
probably
compromised
herself
thereby
i
had
not
understood
then
a
second
mad
idea
flashed
into
my
brain
polina
i
said
give
me
but
an
hour
wait
here
just
one
hour
until
i
return
yes
you
must
do
so
do
you
not
see
what
i
mean
just
stay
here
for
that
time
and
i
rushed
from
the
room
without
so
much
as
answering
her
look
of
inquiry
she
called
something
after
me
but
i
did
not
return
sometimes
it
happens
that
the
most
insane
thought
the
most
impossible
conception
will
become
so
fixed
in
one
head
that
at
length
one
believes
the
thought
or
the
conception
to
be
reality
moreover
if
with
the
thought
or
the
conception
there
is
combined
a
strong
a
passionate
desire
one
will
come
to
look
upon
the
said
thought
or
conception
as
something
fated
inevitable
and
foreordained
something
bound
to
happen
whether
by
this
there
is
connoted
something
in
the
nature
of
a
combination
of
presentiments
or
a
great
effort
of
will
or
a
of
one
true
expectations
and
so
on
i
do
not
know
but
at
all
events
that
night
saw
happen
to
me
a
night
which
i
shall
never
forget
something
in
the
nature
of
the
miraculous
although
the
occurrence
can
easily
be
explained
by
arithmetic
i
still
believe
it
to
have
been
a
miracle
yet
why
did
this
conviction
take
such
a
hold
upon
me
at
the
time
and
remain
with
me
ever
since
previously
i
had
thought
of
the
idea
not
as
an
occurrence
which
was
ever
likely
to
come
about
but
as
something
which
never
could
come
about
the
time
was
a
quarter
past
eleven
when
i
entered
the
casino
in
such
a
state
of
hope
though
at
the
same
time
of
agitation
as
i
had
never
before
experienced
in
the
there
were
still
a
large
number
of
people
but
not
half
as
many
as
had
been
present
in
the
morning
at
eleven
there
usually
remained
behind
only
the
real
the
desperate
gamblers
persons
for
whom
at
spas
there
existed
nothing
beyond
roulette
and
who
went
thither
for
that
alone
these
gamesters
took
little
note
of
what
was
going
on
around
them
and
were
interested
in
none
of
the
appurtenances
of
the
season
but
played
from
morning
till
night
and
would
have
been
ready
to
play
through
the
night
until
dawn
had
that
been
possible
as
it
was
they
used
to
disperse
unwillingly
when
at
midnight
roulette
came
to
an
end
likewise
as
soon
as
ever
roulette
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
the
head
croupier
had
called
les
trois
derniers
coups
most
of
them
were
ready
to
stake
on
the
last
three
rounds
all
that
they
had
in
their
pockets
and
for
the
most
part
lost
it
for
my
own
part
i
proceeded
towards
the
table
at
which
the
grandmother
had
lately
sat
and
since
the
crowd
around
it
was
not
very
large
i
soon
obtained
standing
room
among
the
ring
of
gamblers
while
directly
in
front
of
me
on
the
green
cloth
i
saw
marked
the
word
passe
passe
was
a
row
of
numbers
from
to
inclusive
while
a
row
of
numbers
from
to
inclusive
was
known
as
manque
but
what
had
that
to
do
with
me
i
had
not
noticed
i
had
not
so
much
as
heard
the
numbers
upon
which
the
previous
coup
had
fallen
and
so
took
no
bearings
when
i
began
to
play
as
in
my
place
any
systematic
gambler
would
have
done
no
i
merely
extended
my
stock
of
twenty
pieces
and
threw
them
down
upon
the
space
passe
which
happened
to
be
confronting
me
called
the
croupier
i
had
won
i
staked
upon
the
same
again
both
my
original
stake
and
my
winnings
called
the
croupier
again
i
had
won
and
was
now
in
possession
of
eighty
pieces
next
i
moved
the
whole
eighty
on
to
twelve
middle
numbers
a
stake
which
if
successful
would
bring
me
in
a
triple
profit
but
also
involved
a
risk
of
two
chances
to
one
the
wheel
revolved
and
stopped
at
upon
this
i
was
paid
out
notes
and
gold
until
i
had
by
my
side
a
total
sum
of
two
thousand
gulden
it
was
as
in
a
fever
that
i
moved
the
pile
en
bloc
on
to
the
red
then
suddenly
i
came
to
myself
though
that
was
the
only
time
during
the
evening
play
when
fear
cast
its
cold
spell
over
me
and
showed
itself
in
a
trembling
of
the
hands
and
knees
for
with
horror
i
had
realised
that
i
must
win
and
that
upon
that
stake
there
depended
all
my
life
rouge
called
the
croupier
i
drew
a
long
breath
and
hot
shivers
went
coursing
over
my
body
i
was
paid
out
my
winnings
in
amounting
of
course
to
a
total
of
four
thousand
florins
eight
hundred
gulden
i
could
still
calculate
the
amounts
after
that
i
remember
i
again
staked
two
thousand
florins
upon
twelve
middle
numbers
and
lost
again
i
staked
the
whole
of
my
gold
with
eight
hundred
gulden
in
notes
and
lost
then
madness
seemed
to
come
upon
me
and
seizing
my
last
two
thousand
florins
i
staked
them
upon
twelve
of
the
first
numbers
wholly
by
chance
and
at
random
and
without
any
sort
of
reckoning
upon
my
doing
so
there
followed
a
moment
of
suspense
only
comparable
to
that
which
madame
blanchard
must
have
experienced
when
in
paris
she
was
descending
earthwards
from
a
balloon
quatre
called
the
croupier
once
more
with
the
addition
of
my
original
stake
i
was
in
possession
of
six
thousand
florins
once
more
i
looked
around
me
like
a
conqueror
once
more
i
feared
nothing
as
i
threw
down
four
thousand
of
these
florins
upon
the
black
the
croupiers
glanced
around
them
and
exchanged
a
few
words
the
bystanders
murmured
expectantly
the
black
turned
up
after
that
i
do
not
exactly
remember
either
my
calculations
or
the
order
of
my
stakings
i
only
remember
that
as
in
a
dream
i
won
in
one
round
sixteen
thousand
florins
that
in
the
three
following
rounds
i
lost
twelve
thousand
that
i
moved
the
remainder
four
thousand
on
to
passe
though
quite
unconscious
of
what
i
was
doing
i
was
merely
waiting
as
it
were
mechanically
and
without
reflection
for
something
and
won
and
that
finally
four
times
in
succession
i
lost
yes
i
can
remember
raking
in
money
by
thousands
but
most
frequently
on
the
twelve
middle
numbers
to
which
i
constantly
adhered
and
which
kept
appearing
in
a
sort
of
regular
order
first
three
or
four
times
running
and
then
after
an
interval
of
a
couple
of
rounds
in
another
break
of
three
or
four
appearances
sometimes
this
astonishing
regularity
manifested
itself
in
patches
a
thing
to
upset
all
the
calculations
of
note
taking
gamblers
who
play
with
a
pencil
and
a
memorandum
book
in
their
hands
fortune
perpetrates
some
terrible
jests
at
roulette
since
my
entry
not
more
than
half
an
hour
could
have
elapsed
suddenly
a
croupier
informed
me
that
i
had
won
thirty
thousand
florins
as
well
as
that
since
the
latter
was
the
limit
for
which
at
any
one
time
the
bank
could
make
itself
responsible
roulette
at
that
table
must
close
for
the
night
accordingly
i
caught
up
my
pile
of
gold
stuffed
it
into
my
pocket
and
grasping
my
sheaf
of
moved
to
the
table
in
an
adjoining
salon
where
a
second
game
of
roulette
was
in
progress
the
crowd
followed
me
in
a
body
and
cleared
a
place
for
me
at
the
table
after
which
i
proceeded
to
stake
as
before
that
is
to
say
at
random
and
without
calculating
what
saved
me
from
ruin
i
do
not
know
of
course
there
were
times
when
fragmentary
reckonings
did
come
flashing
into
my
brain
for
instance
there
were
times
when
i
attached
myself
for
a
while
to
certain
figures
and
coups
though
always
leaving
them
again
before
long
without
knowing
what
i
was
doing
in
fact
i
can
not
have
been
in
possession
of
all
my
faculties
for
i
can
remember
the
croupiers
correcting
my
play
more
than
once
owing
to
my
having
made
mistakes
of
the
gravest
order
my
brows
were
damp
with
sweat
and
my
hands
were
shaking
also
poles
came
around
me
to
proffer
their
services
but
i
heeded
none
of
them
nor
did
my
luck
fail
me
now
suddenly
there
arose
around
me
a
loud
din
of
talking
and
laughter
bravo
bravo
was
the
general
shout
and
some
people
even
clapped
their
hands
i
had
raked
in
thirty
thousand
florins
and
again
the
bank
had
had
to
close
for
the
night
go
away
now
go
away
now
a
voice
whispered
to
me
on
my
right
the
person
who
had
spoken
to
me
was
a
certain
jew
of
frankfurt
a
man
who
had
been
standing
beside
me
the
whole
while
and
occasionally
helping
me
in
my
play
yes
for
god
sake
go
whispered
a
second
voice
in
my
left
ear
glancing
around
i
perceived
that
the
second
voice
had
come
from
a
modestly
plainly
dressed
lady
of
rather
less
than
thirty
a
woman
whose
face
though
pale
and
bore
also
very
evident
traces
of
former
beauty
at
the
moment
i
was
stuffing
the
crumpled
into
my
pockets
and
collecting
all
the
gold
that
was
left
on
the
table
seizing
up
my
last
note
for
five
hundred
gulden
i
contrived
to
insinuate
it
unperceived
into
the
hand
of
the
pale
lady
an
overpowering
impulse
had
made
me
do
so
and
i
remember
how
her
thin
little
fingers
pressed
mine
in
token
of
her
lively
gratitude
the
whole
affair
was
the
work
of
a
moment
then
collecting
my
belongings
i
crossed
to
where
trente
et
quarante
was
being
played
a
game
which
could
boast
of
a
more
aristocratic
public
and
was
played
with
cards
instead
of
with
a
wheel
at
this
diversion
the
bank
made
itself
responsible
for
a
hundred
thousand
thalers
as
the
limit
but
the
highest
stake
allowable
was
as
in
roulette
four
thousand
florins
although
i
knew
nothing
of
the
game
and
i
scarcely
knew
the
stakes
except
those
on
black
and
red
i
joined
the
ring
of
players
while
the
rest
of
the
crowd
massed
itself
around
me
at
this
distance
of
time
i
can
not
remember
whether
i
ever
gave
a
thought
to
polina
i
seemed
only
to
be
conscious
of
a
vague
pleasure
in
seizing
and
raking
in
the
which
kept
massing
themselves
in
a
pile
before
me
but
as
ever
fortune
seemed
to
be
at
my
back
as
though
of
set
purpose
there
came
to
my
aid
a
circumstance
which
not
infrequently
repeats
itself
in
gaming
the
circumstance
is
that
not
infrequently
luck
attaches
itself
to
say
the
red
and
does
not
leave
it
for
a
space
of
say
ten
or
even
fifteen
rounds
in
succession
three
days
ago
i
had
heard
that
during
the
previous
week
there
had
been
a
run
of
coups
on
the
red
an
occurrence
never
before
known
at
roulette
so
that
men
spoke
of
it
with
astonishment
naturally
enough
many
deserted
the
red
after
a
dozen
rounds
and
practically
no
one
could
now
be
found
to
stake
upon
it
yet
upon
the
black
also
the
antithesis
of
the
red
no
experienced
gambler
would
stake
anything
for
the
reason
that
every
practised
player
knows
the
meaning
of
capricious
fortune
that
is
to
say
after
the
sixteenth
or
so
success
of
the
red
one
would
think
that
the
seventeenth
coup
would
inevitably
fall
upon
the
black
wherefore
novices
would
be
apt
to
back
the
latter
in
the
seventeenth
round
and
even
to
double
or
treble
their
stakes
upon
it
only
in
the
end
to
lose
yet
some
whim
or
other
led
me
on
remarking
that
the
red
had
come
up
consecutively
for
seven
times
to
attach
myself
to
that
colour
probably
this
was
mostly
due
to
for
i
wanted
to
astonish
the
bystanders
with
the
riskiness
of
my
play
also
i
remember
that
oh
strange
sensation
i
suddenly
and
without
any
challenge
from
my
own
presumption
became
obsessed
with
a
desire
to
take
risks
if
the
spirit
has
passed
through
a
great
many
sensations
possibly
it
can
no
longer
be
sated
with
them
but
grows
more
excited
and
demands
more
sensations
and
stronger
and
stronger
ones
until
at
length
it
falls
exhausted
certainly
if
the
rules
of
the
game
had
permitted
even
of
my
staking
fifty
thousand
florins
at
a
time
i
should
have
staked
them
all
of
a
sudden
i
heard
exclamations
arising
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
marvel
since
the
red
was
turning
up
for
the
fourteenth
time
monsieur
a
gagne
cent
mille
florins
a
voice
exclaimed
beside
me
i
awoke
to
my
senses
what
i
had
won
a
hundred
thousand
florins
if
so
what
more
did
i
need
to
win
i
grasped
the
banknotes
stuffed
them
into
my
pockets
raked
in
the
gold
without
counting
it
and
started
to
leave
the
casino
as
i
passed
through
the
salons
people
smiled
to
see
my
bulging
pockets
and
unsteady
gait
for
the
weight
which
i
was
carrying
must
have
amounted
to
half
a
pood
several
hands
i
saw
stretched
out
in
my
direction
and
as
i
passed
i
filled
them
with
all
the
money
that
i
could
grasp
in
my
own
at
length
two
jews
stopped
me
near
the
exit
you
are
a
bold
young
fellow
one
said
but
mind
you
depart
early
tomorrow
as
early
as
you
can
for
if
you
do
not
you
will
lose
everything
that
you
have
won
but
i
did
not
heed
them
the
avenue
was
so
dark
that
it
was
barely
possible
to
distinguish
one
hand
before
one
face
while
the
distance
to
the
hotel
was
half
a
verst
or
so
but
i
feared
neither
pickpockets
nor
highwaymen
indeed
never
since
my
boyhood
have
i
done
that
also
i
can
not
remember
what
i
thought
about
on
the
way
i
only
felt
a
sort
of
fearful
pleasure
the
pleasure
of
success
of
conquest
of
power
how
can
i
best
express
it
likewise
before
me
there
flitted
the
image
of
polina
and
i
kept
remembering
and
reminding
myself
that
it
was
to
her
i
was
going
that
it
was
in
her
presence
i
should
soon
be
standing
that
it
was
she
to
whom
i
should
soon
be
able
to
relate
and
show
everything
scarcely
once
did
i
recall
what
she
had
lately
said
to
me
or
the
reason
why
i
had
left
her
or
all
those
varied
sensations
which
i
had
been
experiencing
a
bare
hour
and
a
half
ago
no
those
sensations
seemed
to
be
things
of
the
past
to
be
things
which
had
righted
themselves
and
grown
old
to
be
things
concerning
which
we
needed
to
trouble
ourselves
no
longer
since
for
us
life
was
about
to
begin
anew
yet
i
had
just
reached
the
end
of
the
avenue
when
there
did
come
upon
me
a
fear
of
being
robbed
or
murdered
with
each
step
the
fear
increased
until
in
my
terror
i
almost
started
to
run
suddenly
as
i
issued
from
the
avenue
there
burst
upon
me
the
lights
of
the
hotel
sparkling
with
a
myriad
lamps
yes
thanks
be
to
god
i
had
reached
home
running
up
to
my
room
i
flung
open
the
door
of
it
polina
was
still
on
the
sofa
with
a
lighted
candle
in
front
of
her
and
her
hands
clasped
as
i
entered
she
stared
at
me
in
astonishment
for
at
the
moment
i
must
have
presented
a
strange
spectacle
all
i
did
however
was
to
halt
before
her
and
fling
upon
the
table
my
burden
of
wealth
xv
i
remember
too
how
without
moving
from
her
place
or
changing
her
attitude
she
gazed
into
my
face
i
have
won
two
hundred
thousand
francs
cried
i
as
i
pulled
out
my
last
sheaf
of
the
pile
of
paper
currency
occupied
the
whole
table
i
could
not
withdraw
my
eyes
from
it
consequently
for
a
moment
or
two
polina
escaped
my
mind
then
i
set
myself
to
arrange
the
pile
in
order
and
to
sort
the
notes
and
to
mass
the
gold
in
a
separate
heap
that
done
i
left
everything
where
it
lay
and
proceeded
to
pace
the
room
with
rapid
strides
as
i
lost
myself
in
thought
then
i
darted
to
the
table
once
more
and
began
to
recount
the
money
until
all
of
a
sudden
as
though
i
had
remembered
something
i
rushed
to
the
door
and
closed
and
it
finally
i
came
to
a
meditative
halt
before
my
little
trunk
shall
i
put
the
money
there
until
tomorrow
i
asked
turning
sharply
round
to
polina
as
the
recollection
of
her
returned
to
me
she
was
still
in
her
old
place
still
making
not
a
sound
yet
her
eyes
had
followed
every
one
of
my
movements
somehow
in
her
face
there
was
a
strange
expression
an
expression
which
i
did
not
like
i
think
that
i
shall
not
be
wrong
if
i
say
that
it
indicated
sheer
hatred
impulsively
i
approached
her
polina
i
said
here
are
thousand
florins
fifty
thousand
francs
or
more
take
them
and
tomorrow
throw
them
in
de
griers
face
she
returned
no
answer
or
if
you
should
prefer
i
continued
let
me
take
them
to
him
myself
tomorrow
yes
early
tomorrow
morning
shall
i
then
all
at
once
she
burst
out
laughing
and
laughed
for
a
long
while
with
astonishment
and
a
feeling
of
offence
i
gazed
at
her
her
laughter
was
too
like
the
derisive
merriment
which
she
had
so
often
indulged
in
of
late
merriment
which
had
broken
forth
always
at
the
time
of
my
most
passionate
explanations
at
length
she
ceased
and
frowned
at
me
from
under
her
eyebrows
i
am
not
going
to
take
your
money
she
said
contemptuously
why
not
i
cried
why
not
polina
because
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
receiving
money
for
nothing
but
i
am
offering
it
to
you
as
a
friend
in
the
same
way
i
would
offer
you
my
very
life
upon
this
she
threw
me
a
long
questioning
glance
as
though
she
were
seeking
to
probe
me
to
the
depths
you
are
giving
too
much
for
me
she
remarked
with
a
smile
the
beloved
of
de
griers
is
not
worth
fifty
thousand
francs
oh
polina
how
can
you
speak
so
i
exclaimed
reproachfully
am
i
de
griers
you
she
cried
with
her
eyes
suddenly
flashing
why
i
hate
you
yes
yes
i
hate
you
i
love
you
no
more
than
i
do
de
griers
then
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
relapsed
into
hysterics
i
darted
to
her
side
somehow
i
had
an
intuition
of
something
having
happened
to
her
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
myself
she
was
like
a
person
temporarily
insane
buy
me
would
you
would
you
would
you
buy
me
for
fifty
thousand
francs
as
de
griers
did
she
gasped
between
her
convulsive
sobs
i
clasped
her
in
my
arms
kissed
her
hands
and
feet
and
fell
upon
my
knees
before
her
presently
the
hysterical
fit
passed
away
and
laying
her
hands
upon
my
shoulders
she
gazed
for
a
while
into
my
face
as
though
trying
to
read
it
something
i
said
to
her
but
it
was
clear
that
she
did
not
hear
it
her
face
looked
so
dark
and
despondent
that
i
began
to
fear
for
her
reason
at
length
she
drew
me
towards
herself
a
trustful
smile
playing
over
her
features
and
then
as
suddenly
she
pushed
me
away
again
as
she
eyed
me
dimly
finally
she
threw
herself
upon
me
in
an
embrace
you
love
me
she
said
do
you
you
who
were
willing
even
to
quarrel
with
the
baron
at
my
bidding
then
she
laughed
laughed
as
though
something
dear
but
laughable
had
recurred
to
her
memory
yes
she
laughed
and
wept
at
the
same
time
what
was
i
to
do
i
was
like
a
man
in
a
fever
i
remember
that
she
began
to
say
something
to
me
though
what
i
do
not
know
since
she
spoke
with
a
feverish
lisp
as
though
she
were
trying
to
tell
me
something
very
quickly
at
intervals
too
she
would
break
off
into
the
smile
which
i
was
beginning
to
dread
no
no
she
kept
repeating
you
are
my
dear
one
you
are
the
man
i
trust
again
she
laid
her
hands
upon
my
shoulders
and
again
she
gazed
at
me
as
she
reiterated
you
love
me
you
love
me
will
you
always
love
me
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
off
her
never
before
had
i
seen
her
in
this
mood
of
humility
and
affection
true
the
mood
was
the
outcome
of
hysteria
but
all
of
a
sudden
she
noticed
my
ardent
gaze
and
smiled
slightly
the
next
moment
for
no
apparent
reason
she
began
to
talk
of
astley
she
continued
talking
and
talking
about
him
but
i
could
not
make
out
all
she
said
more
particularly
when
she
was
endeavouring
to
tell
me
of
something
or
other
which
had
happened
recently
on
the
whole
she
appeared
to
be
laughing
at
astley
for
she
kept
repeating
that
he
was
waiting
for
her
and
did
i
know
whether
even
at
that
moment
he
was
not
standing
beneath
the
window
yes
yes
he
is
there
she
said
open
the
window
and
see
if
he
is
not
she
pushed
me
in
that
direction
yet
no
sooner
did
i
make
a
movement
to
obey
her
behest
than
she
burst
into
laughter
and
i
remained
beside
her
and
she
embraced
me
shall
we
go
away
tomorrow
presently
she
asked
as
though
some
disturbing
thought
had
recurred
to
her
recollection
how
would
it
be
if
we
were
to
try
and
overtake
grandmamma
i
think
we
should
do
so
at
berlin
and
what
think
you
she
would
have
to
say
to
us
when
we
caught
her
up
and
her
eyes
first
lit
upon
us
what
too
about
astley
he
would
not
leap
from
the
shlangenberg
for
my
sake
no
of
that
i
am
very
sure
and
she
laughed
do
you
know
where
he
is
going
next
year
he
says
he
intends
to
go
to
the
north
pole
for
scientific
investigations
and
has
invited
me
to
go
with
him
ha
ha
ha
he
also
says
that
we
russians
know
nothing
can
do
nothing
without
european
help
but
he
is
a
good
fellow
all
the
same
for
instance
he
does
not
blame
the
general
in
the
matter
but
declares
that
mlle
blanche
that
love
but
no
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
know
she
stopped
suddenly
as
though
she
had
said
her
say
and
was
feeling
bewildered
what
poor
creatures
these
people
are
how
sorry
i
am
for
them
and
for
grandmamma
but
when
are
you
going
to
kill
de
griers
surely
you
do
not
intend
actually
to
murder
him
you
fool
do
you
suppose
that
i
should
allow
you
to
fight
de
griers
nor
shall
you
kill
the
baron
here
she
burst
out
laughing
how
absurd
you
looked
when
you
were
talking
to
the
burmergelms
i
was
watching
you
all
the
time
watching
you
from
where
i
was
sitting
and
how
unwilling
you
were
to
go
when
i
sent
you
oh
how
i
laughed
and
laughed
then
she
kissed
and
embraced
me
again
again
she
pressed
her
face
to
mine
with
tender
passion
yet
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
her
for
my
head
was
in
a
whirl
it
must
have
been
about
seven
in
the
morning
when
i
awoke
daylight
had
come
and
polina
was
sitting
by
my
side
a
strange
expression
on
her
face
as
though
she
had
seen
a
vision
and
was
unable
to
collect
her
thoughts
she
too
had
just
awoken
and
was
now
staring
at
the
money
on
the
table
my
head
ached
it
felt
heavy
i
attempted
to
take
polina
hand
but
she
pushed
me
from
her
and
leapt
from
the
sofa
the
dawn
was
full
of
mist
for
rain
had
fallen
yet
she
moved
to
the
window
opened
it
and
leaning
her
elbows
upon
the
thrust
out
her
head
and
shoulders
to
take
the
air
in
this
position
did
she
remain
for
several
minutes
without
ever
looking
round
at
me
or
listening
to
what
i
was
saying
into
my
head
there
came
the
uneasy
thought
what
is
to
happen
now
how
is
it
all
to
end
suddenly
polina
rose
from
the
window
approached
the
table
and
looking
at
me
with
an
expression
of
infinite
aversion
said
with
lips
which
quivered
with
anger
well
are
you
going
to
hand
me
over
my
fifty
thousand
francs
polina
you
say
that
again
again
i
exclaimed
you
have
changed
your
mind
then
ha
ha
ha
you
are
sorry
you
ever
promised
them
on
the
table
where
the
previous
night
i
had
counted
the
money
there
still
was
lying
the
packet
of
twenty
five
thousand
florins
i
handed
it
to
her
the
francs
are
mine
then
are
they
they
are
mine
she
inquired
viciously
as
she
balanced
the
money
in
her
hands
yes
they
have
always
been
yours
i
said
then
take
your
fifty
thousand
francs
and
she
hurled
them
full
in
my
face
the
packet
burst
as
she
did
so
and
the
floor
became
strewed
with
the
instant
that
the
deed
was
done
she
rushed
from
the
room
at
that
moment
she
can
not
have
been
in
her
right
mind
yet
what
was
the
cause
of
her
temporary
aberration
i
can
not
say
for
a
month
past
she
had
been
unwell
yet
what
had
brought
about
this
present
condition
of
mind
above
all
things
this
outburst
had
it
come
of
wounded
pride
had
it
come
of
despair
over
her
decision
to
come
to
me
had
it
come
of
the
fact
that
presuming
too
much
on
my
good
fortune
i
had
seemed
to
be
intending
to
desert
her
even
as
de
griers
had
done
when
once
i
had
given
her
the
fifty
thousand
francs
but
on
my
honour
i
had
never
cherished
any
such
intention
what
was
at
fault
i
think
was
her
own
pride
which
kept
urging
her
not
to
trust
me
but
rather
to
insult
me
even
though
she
had
not
realised
the
fact
in
her
eyes
i
corresponded
to
de
griers
and
therefore
had
been
condemned
for
a
fault
not
wholly
my
own
her
mood
of
late
had
been
a
sort
of
delirium
a
sort
of
that
i
knew
full
well
yet
never
had
i
sufficiently
taken
it
into
consideration
perhaps
she
would
not
pardon
me
now
ah
but
this
was
the
present
what
about
the
future
her
delirium
and
sickness
were
not
likely
to
make
her
forget
what
she
had
done
in
bringing
me
de
griers
letter
no
she
must
have
known
what
she
was
doing
when
she
brought
it
somehow
i
contrived
to
stuff
the
pile
of
notes
and
gold
under
the
bed
to
cover
them
over
and
then
to
leave
the
room
some
ten
minutes
after
polina
i
felt
sure
that
she
had
returned
to
her
own
room
wherefore
i
intended
quietly
to
follow
her
and
to
ask
the
nursemaid
aid
who
opened
the
door
how
her
mistress
was
judge
therefore
of
my
surprise
when
meeting
the
domestic
on
the
stairs
she
informed
me
that
polina
had
not
yet
returned
and
that
she
the
domestic
was
at
that
moment
on
her
way
to
my
room
in
quest
of
her
mlle
left
me
but
ten
minutes
ago
i
said
what
can
have
become
of
her
the
nursemaid
looked
at
me
reproachfully
already
sundry
rumours
were
flying
about
the
hotel
both
in
the
office
of
the
commissionaire
and
in
that
of
the
landlord
it
was
whispered
that
at
seven
that
morning
the
fraulein
had
left
the
hotel
and
set
off
despite
the
rain
in
the
direction
of
the
hotel
from
words
and
hints
let
fall
i
could
see
that
the
fact
of
polina
having
spent
the
night
in
my
room
was
now
public
property
also
sundry
rumours
were
circulating
concerning
the
general
family
affairs
it
was
known
that
last
night
he
had
gone
out
of
his
mind
and
paraded
the
hotel
in
tears
also
that
the
old
lady
who
had
arrived
was
his
mother
and
that
she
had
come
from
russia
on
purpose
to
forbid
her
son
marriage
with
mlle
de
cominges
as
well
as
to
cut
him
out
of
her
will
if
he
should
disobey
her
also
that
because
he
had
disobeyed
her
she
had
squandered
all
her
money
at
roulette
in
order
to
have
nothing
more
to
leave
to
him
oh
these
russians
exclaimed
the
landlord
with
an
angry
toss
of
the
head
while
the
bystanders
laughed
and
the
clerk
betook
himself
to
his
accounts
also
every
one
had
learnt
about
my
winnings
karl
the
corridor
lacquey
was
the
first
to
congratulate
me
but
with
these
folk
i
had
nothing
to
do
my
business
was
to
set
off
at
full
speed
to
the
hotel
as
yet
it
was
early
for
astley
to
receive
visitors
but
as
soon
as
he
learnt
that
it
was
i
who
had
arrived
he
came
out
into
the
corridor
to
meet
me
and
stood
looking
at
me
in
silence
with
his
eyes
as
he
waited
to
hear
what
i
had
to
say
i
inquired
after
polina
she
is
ill
he
replied
still
looking
at
me
with
his
direct
unwavering
glance
and
she
is
in
your
rooms
yes
she
is
in
my
rooms
then
you
are
minded
to
keep
her
there
yes
i
am
minded
to
keep
her
there
but
astley
that
will
raise
a
scandal
it
ought
not
to
be
allowed
besides
she
is
very
perhaps
you
had
not
remarked
that
yes
i
have
it
was
i
who
told
you
about
it
had
she
not
been
ill
she
would
not
have
gone
and
spent
the
night
with
you
then
you
know
all
about
it
yes
for
last
night
she
was
to
have
accompanied
me
to
the
house
of
a
relative
of
mine
unfortunately
being
ill
she
made
a
mistake
and
went
to
your
rooms
instead
indeed
then
i
wish
you
joy
astley
apropos
you
have
reminded
me
of
something
were
you
beneath
my
window
last
night
every
moment
mlle
polina
kept
telling
me
to
open
the
window
and
see
if
you
were
there
after
which
she
always
smiled
indeed
no
i
was
not
there
but
i
was
waiting
in
the
corridor
and
walking
about
the
hotel
she
ought
to
see
a
doctor
you
know
mr
astley
yes
she
ought
i
have
sent
for
one
and
if
she
dies
i
shall
hold
you
responsible
this
surprised
me
pardon
me
i
replied
but
what
do
you
mean
never
mind
tell
me
if
it
is
true
that
last
night
you
won
two
hundred
thousand
thalers
no
i
won
a
hundred
thousand
florins
good
heavens
then
i
suppose
you
will
be
off
to
paris
this
morning
why
because
all
russians
who
have
grown
rich
go
to
paris
explained
astley
as
though
he
had
read
the
fact
in
a
book
but
what
could
i
do
in
paris
in
summer
time
i
love
her
astley
surely
you
know
that
indeed
i
am
sure
that
you
do
not
moreover
if
you
were
to
stay
here
you
would
lose
everything
that
you
possess
and
have
nothing
left
with
which
to
pay
your
expenses
in
paris
well
now
i
feel
sure
that
today
will
see
you
gone
from
here
but
i
am
not
going
to
paris
likewise
pardon
me
what
is
to
become
of
this
family
i
mean
that
the
affair
of
the
general
and
mlle
polina
will
soon
be
all
over
the
town
i
daresay
yet
i
hardly
suppose
that
that
will
break
the
heart
moreover
mlle
polina
has
a
perfect
right
to
live
where
she
chooses
in
short
we
may
say
that
as
a
family
this
family
has
ceased
to
exist
i
departed
and
found
myself
smiling
at
the
englishman
strange
assurance
that
i
should
soon
be
leaving
for
paris
i
suppose
he
means
to
shoot
me
in
a
duel
should
polina
die
yes
that
is
what
he
intends
to
do
now
although
i
was
honestly
sorry
for
polina
it
is
a
fact
that
from
the
moment
when
the
previous
night
i
had
approached
the
and
begun
to
rake
in
the
packets
of
my
love
for
her
had
entered
upon
a
new
plane
yes
i
can
say
that
now
although
at
the
time
i
was
barely
conscious
of
it
was
i
then
at
heart
a
gambler
did
i
after
all
love
polina
not
so
very
much
no
no
as
god
is
my
witness
i
loved
her
even
when
i
was
returning
home
from
astley
my
suffering
was
genuine
and
my
sincere
but
presently
i
was
to
go
through
an
exceedingly
strange
and
ugly
experience
i
was
proceeding
to
the
general
rooms
when
i
heard
a
door
near
me
open
and
a
voice
call
me
by
name
it
was
mlle
mother
the
widow
de
cominges
who
was
inviting
me
in
her
daughter
name
to
enter
i
did
so
whereupon
i
heard
a
laugh
and
a
little
cry
proceed
from
the
bedroom
the
pair
occupied
a
suite
of
two
apartments
where
mlle
blanche
was
just
arising
ah
lui
viens
donc
bete
is
it
true
that
you
have
won
a
mountain
of
gold
and
silver
mieux
yes
i
replied
with
a
smile
how
much
a
hundred
thousand
florins
bibi
comme
tu
es
bete
come
in
here
for
i
ca
hear
you
where
you
are
now
nous
ferons
bombance
pas
entering
her
room
i
found
her
lolling
under
a
pink
satin
coverlet
and
revealing
a
pair
of
swarthy
wonderfully
healthy
shoulders
shoulders
such
as
one
sees
in
dreams
shoulders
covered
over
with
a
white
cambric
nightgown
which
trimmed
with
lace
stood
out
in
striking
relief
against
the
darkness
of
her
skin
mon
fils
du
coeur
she
cried
when
she
saw
me
and
then
giggled
her
laugh
had
always
been
a
very
cheerful
one
and
at
times
it
even
sounded
sincere
tout
autre
i
began
paraphrasing
corneille
see
here
she
prattled
on
please
search
for
my
stockings
and
help
me
to
dress
aussi
si
tu
pas
trop
bete
je
te
prends
a
paris
i
am
just
off
let
me
tell
you
this
moment
in
half
an
hour
true
enough
everything
stood
trunks
portmanteaux
and
all
coffee
had
long
been
served
eh
bien
tu
verras
paris
dis
donc
que
tu
etais
bien
bete
quand
tu
etais
where
are
my
stockings
please
help
me
to
dress
and
she
lifted
up
a
really
ravishing
foot
small
swarthy
and
not
misshapen
like
the
majority
of
feet
which
look
dainty
only
in
bottines
i
laughed
and
started
to
draw
on
to
the
foot
a
silk
stocking
while
mlle
blanche
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
chattered
eh
bien
que
si
je
te
prends
avec
moi
first
of
all
i
must
have
fifty
thousand
francs
and
you
shall
give
them
to
me
at
frankfurt
then
we
will
go
on
to
paris
where
we
will
live
together
et
je
te
ferai
voir
des
etoiles
en
plein
jour
yes
you
shall
see
such
women
as
your
eyes
have
never
lit
upon
stop
a
moment
if
i
were
to
give
you
those
fifty
thousand
francs
what
should
i
have
left
for
myself
another
hundred
thousand
francs
please
to
remember
besides
i
could
live
with
you
in
your
rooms
for
a
month
or
even
for
two
or
even
for
longer
but
it
would
not
take
us
more
than
two
months
to
get
through
fifty
thousand
francs
for
look
you
je
suis
bonne
enfante
et
tu
verras
des
etoiles
you
may
be
sure
what
you
mean
to
say
that
we
should
spend
the
whole
in
two
months
certainly
does
that
surprise
you
very
much
ah
vil
esclave
why
one
month
of
that
life
would
be
better
than
all
your
previous
existence
one
month
et
apres
le
deluge
mais
tu
ne
peux
comprendre
va
away
away
you
are
not
worth
ah
que
for
while
drawing
on
the
other
stocking
i
had
felt
constrained
to
kiss
her
immediately
she
shrunk
back
kicked
me
in
the
face
with
her
toes
and
turned
me
neck
and
prop
out
of
the
room
eh
bien
mon
she
called
after
me
je
si
tu
veux
i
start
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
time
i
returned
to
my
own
room
with
my
head
in
a
whirl
it
was
not
my
fault
that
polina
had
thrown
a
packet
in
my
face
and
preferred
astley
to
myself
a
few
were
still
fluttering
about
the
floor
and
i
picked
them
up
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
landlord
appeared
a
person
who
until
now
had
never
bestowed
upon
me
so
much
as
a
glance
he
had
come
to
know
if
i
would
prefer
to
move
to
a
lower
floor
to
a
suite
which
had
just
been
tenanted
by
count
for
a
moment
i
reflected
no
i
shouted
my
account
please
for
in
ten
minutes
i
shall
be
gone
to
paris
to
paris
i
added
to
myself
every
man
of
birth
must
make
her
acquaintance
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
all
three
of
us
were
seated
in
a
family
compartment
mlle
blanche
the
widow
de
cominges
and
myself
mlle
kept
laughing
hysterically
as
she
looked
at
me
and
madame
her
but
i
did
not
feel
so
cheerful
my
life
had
broken
in
two
and
yesterday
had
infected
me
with
a
habit
of
staking
my
all
upon
a
card
although
it
might
be
that
i
had
failed
to
win
my
stake
that
i
had
lost
my
senses
that
i
desired
nothing
better
i
felt
that
the
scene
was
to
be
changed
only
for
a
time
within
a
month
from
now
i
kept
thinking
to
myself
i
shall
be
back
again
in
roulettenberg
and
then
i
mean
to
have
it
out
with
you
mr
astley
yes
as
now
i
look
back
at
things
i
remember
that
i
felt
greatly
depressed
despite
the
absurd
gigglings
of
the
egregious
blanche
what
is
the
matter
with
you
how
dull
you
are
she
cried
at
length
as
she
interrupted
her
laughter
to
take
me
seriously
to
task
come
come
we
are
going
to
spend
your
two
hundred
thousand
francs
for
you
et
tu
seras
heureux
comme
un
petit
roi
i
myself
will
tie
your
tie
for
you
and
introduce
you
to
hortense
and
when
we
have
spent
your
money
you
shall
return
here
and
break
the
bank
again
what
did
those
two
jews
tell
you
that
the
thing
most
needed
is
daring
and
that
you
possess
it
consequently
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
you
will
be
hurrying
to
paris
with
money
in
your
pocket
quant
moi
je
veux
cinquante
mille
francs
de
rente
et
alors
but
what
about
the
general
i
interrupted
the
general
you
know
well
enough
that
at
about
this
hour
every
day
he
goes
to
buy
me
a
bouquet
on
this
occasion
i
took
care
to
tell
him
that
he
must
hunt
for
the
choicest
of
flowers
and
when
he
returns
home
the
poor
fellow
will
find
the
bird
flown
possibly
he
may
take
wing
in
pursuit
ha
ha
ha
and
if
so
i
shall
not
be
sorry
for
he
could
be
useful
to
me
in
paris
and
astley
will
pay
his
debts
here
in
this
manner
did
i
depart
for
the
gay
city
xvi
of
paris
what
am
i
to
say
the
whole
proceeding
was
a
delirium
a
madness
i
spent
a
little
over
three
weeks
there
and
during
that
time
saw
my
hundred
thousand
francs
come
to
an
end
i
speak
only
of
the
one
hundred
thousand
francs
for
the
other
hundred
thousand
i
gave
to
mlle
blanche
in
pure
cash
that
is
to
say
i
handed
her
fifty
thousand
francs
at
frankfurt
and
three
days
later
in
paris
advanced
her
another
fifty
thousand
on
note
of
hand
nevertheless
a
week
had
not
elapsed
ere
she
came
to
me
for
more
money
et
les
cent
mille
francs
qui
nous
restent
she
added
tu
les
mangeras
avec
moi
mon
utchitel
yes
she
always
called
me
her
utchitel
a
person
more
economical
grasping
and
mean
than
mlle
blanche
one
could
not
imagine
but
this
was
only
as
regards
her
own
money
my
hundred
thousand
francs
as
she
explained
to
me
later
she
needed
to
set
up
her
establishment
in
paris
so
that
once
and
for
all
i
may
be
on
a
decent
footing
and
proof
against
any
stones
which
may
be
thrown
at
me
at
all
events
for
a
long
time
to
come
nevertheless
i
saw
nothing
of
those
hundred
thousand
francs
for
my
own
purse
which
she
inspected
daily
never
managed
to
amass
in
it
more
than
a
hundred
francs
at
a
time
and
generally
the
sum
did
not
reach
even
that
figure
what
do
you
want
with
money
she
would
say
to
me
with
air
of
absolute
simplicity
and
i
never
disputed
the
point
nevertheless
though
she
fitted
out
her
flat
very
badly
with
the
money
the
fact
did
not
prevent
her
from
saying
when
later
she
was
showing
me
over
the
rooms
of
her
new
abode
see
what
care
and
taste
can
do
with
the
most
wretched
of
means
however
her
wretchedness
had
cost
fifty
thousand
francs
while
with
the
remaining
fifty
thousand
she
purchased
a
carriage
and
horses
also
we
gave
a
couple
of
balls
evening
parties
attended
by
hortense
and
lisette
and
cleopatre
who
were
women
remarkable
both
for
the
number
of
their
liaisons
and
though
only
in
some
cases
for
their
good
looks
at
these
reunions
i
had
to
play
the
part
of
host
to
meet
and
entertain
fat
mercantile
parvenus
who
were
impossible
by
reason
of
their
rudeness
and
braggadocio
colonels
of
various
kinds
hungry
authors
and
journalistic
hacks
all
of
whom
disported
themselves
in
fashionable
tailcoats
and
pale
yellow
gloves
and
displayed
such
an
aggregate
of
conceit
and
gasconade
as
would
be
unthinkable
even
in
petersburg
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
they
used
to
try
to
make
fun
of
me
but
i
would
console
myself
by
drinking
champagne
and
then
lolling
in
a
nevertheless
i
found
it
deadly
work
un
utchitel
blanche
would
say
of
me
qui
a
gagne
deux
cent
mille
francs
and
but
for
me
would
have
had
not
a
notion
how
to
spend
them
presently
he
will
have
to
return
to
his
tutoring
does
any
one
know
of
a
vacant
post
you
know
one
must
do
something
for
him
i
had
the
more
frequent
recourse
to
champagne
in
that
i
constantly
felt
depressed
and
bored
owing
to
the
fact
that
i
was
living
in
the
most
bourgeois
commercial
milieu
imaginable
a
milieu
wherein
every
sou
was
counted
and
grudged
indeed
two
weeks
had
not
elapsed
before
i
perceived
that
blanche
had
no
real
affection
for
me
even
though
she
dressed
me
in
elegant
clothes
and
herself
tied
my
tie
each
day
in
short
she
utterly
despised
me
but
that
caused
me
no
concern
blase
and
inert
i
spent
my
evenings
generally
at
the
chateau
des
fleurs
where
i
would
get
fuddled
and
then
dance
the
cancan
which
in
that
establishment
was
a
very
indecent
performance
with
eclat
at
length
the
time
came
when
blanche
had
drained
my
purse
dry
she
had
conceived
an
idea
that
during
the
term
of
our
residence
together
it
would
be
well
if
i
were
always
to
walk
behind
her
with
a
paper
and
pencil
in
order
to
jot
down
exactly
what
she
spent
what
she
had
saved
what
she
was
paying
out
and
what
she
was
laying
by
well
of
course
i
could
not
fail
to
be
aware
that
this
would
entail
a
battle
over
every
ten
francs
so
although
for
every
possible
objection
that
i
might
make
she
had
prepared
a
suitable
answer
she
soon
saw
that
i
made
no
objections
and
therefore
had
to
start
disputes
herself
that
is
to
say
she
would
burst
out
into
tirades
which
were
met
only
with
silence
as
i
lolled
on
a
sofa
and
stared
fixedly
at
the
ceiling
this
greatly
surprised
her
at
first
she
imagined
that
it
was
due
merely
to
the
fact
that
i
was
a
fool
un
utchitel
wherefore
she
would
break
off
her
harangue
in
the
belief
that
being
too
stupid
to
understand
i
was
a
hopeless
case
then
she
would
leave
the
room
but
return
ten
minutes
later
to
resume
the
contest
this
continued
throughout
her
squandering
of
my
money
a
squandering
altogether
out
of
proportion
to
our
means
an
example
is
the
way
in
which
she
changed
her
first
pair
of
horses
for
a
pair
which
cost
sixteen
thousand
francs
bibi
she
said
on
the
latter
occasion
as
she
approached
me
surely
you
are
not
angry
i
am
merely
tired
was
my
reply
as
i
pushed
her
from
me
this
seemed
to
her
so
curious
that
straightway
she
seated
herself
by
my
side
you
see
she
went
on
i
decided
to
spend
so
much
upon
these
horses
only
because
i
can
easily
sell
them
again
they
would
go
at
any
time
for
twenty
thousand
francs
yes
yes
they
are
splendid
horses
and
you
have
got
a
splendid
i
am
quite
content
let
me
hear
no
more
of
the
matter
then
you
are
not
angry
no
why
should
i
be
you
are
wise
to
provide
yourself
with
what
you
need
for
it
will
all
come
in
handy
in
the
future
yes
i
quite
see
the
necessity
of
your
establishing
yourself
on
a
good
basis
for
without
it
you
will
never
earn
your
million
my
hundred
thousand
francs
i
look
upon
merely
as
a
beginning
as
a
mere
drop
in
the
bucket
blanche
who
had
by
no
means
expected
such
declarations
from
me
but
rather
an
uproar
and
protests
was
rather
taken
aback
well
well
what
a
man
you
are
she
exclaimed
mais
tu
as
pour
comprendre
mon
garcon
although
you
are
a
tutor
you
ought
to
have
been
born
a
prince
are
you
not
sorry
that
your
money
should
be
going
so
quickly
no
the
quicker
it
goes
the
better
mais
dis
donc
are
you
really
rich
mais
you
have
too
much
contempt
for
money
que
tu
feras
apres
dis
donc
apres
i
shall
go
to
homburg
and
win
another
hundred
thousand
francs
oui
oui
ca
magnifique
ah
i
know
you
will
win
them
and
bring
them
to
me
when
you
have
done
so
dis
donc
you
will
end
by
making
me
love
you
since
you
are
what
you
are
i
mean
to
love
you
all
the
time
and
never
to
be
unfaithful
to
you
you
see
i
have
not
loved
you
before
parce
que
je
croyais
que
tu
utchitel
quelque
chose
comme
un
lacquais
pas
yet
all
the
time
i
have
been
true
to
you
parce
que
je
suis
bonne
fille
you
lie
i
interrupted
did
i
not
see
you
the
other
day
with
albert
with
that
officer
oh
oh
mais
tu
es
yes
you
are
lying
right
enough
but
what
makes
you
suppose
that
i
should
be
angry
rubbish
il
faut
que
jeunesse
se
passe
even
if
that
officer
were
here
now
i
should
refrain
from
putting
him
out
of
the
room
if
i
thought
you
really
cared
for
him
only
mind
you
do
not
give
him
any
of
my
money
you
hear
you
say
do
you
that
you
would
not
be
angry
mais
tu
es
un
vrai
philosophe
oui
un
vrai
philosophe
eh
bien
je
je
tu
seras
content
true
enough
from
that
time
onward
she
seemed
to
attach
herself
only
to
me
and
in
this
manner
we
spent
our
last
ten
days
together
the
promised
etoiles
i
did
not
see
but
in
other
respects
she
to
a
certain
extent
kept
her
word
moreover
she
introduced
me
to
hortense
who
was
a
remarkable
woman
in
her
way
and
known
among
us
as
therese
philosophe
but
i
need
not
enlarge
further
for
to
do
so
would
require
a
story
to
itself
and
entail
a
colouring
which
i
am
loth
to
impart
to
the
present
narrative
the
point
is
that
with
all
my
faculties
i
desired
the
episode
to
come
to
an
end
as
speedily
as
possible
unfortunately
our
hundred
thousand
francs
lasted
us
as
i
have
said
for
very
nearly
a
month
which
greatly
surprised
me
at
all
events
blanche
bought
herself
articles
to
the
tune
of
eighty
thousand
francs
and
the
rest
sufficed
just
to
meet
our
expenses
of
living
towards
the
close
of
the
affair
blanche
grew
almost
frank
with
me
at
least
she
scarcely
lied
to
me
at
all
declaring
amongst
other
things
that
none
of
the
debts
which
she
had
been
obliged
to
incur
were
going
to
fall
upon
my
head
i
have
purposely
refrained
from
making
you
responsible
for
my
bills
or
borrowings
she
said
for
the
reason
that
i
am
sorry
for
you
any
other
woman
in
my
place
would
have
done
so
and
have
let
you
go
to
prison
see
then
how
much
i
love
you
and
how
i
am
think
too
what
this
accursed
marriage
with
the
general
is
going
to
cost
me
true
enough
the
marriage
took
place
it
did
so
at
the
close
of
our
month
together
and
i
am
bound
to
suppose
that
it
was
upon
the
ceremony
that
the
last
remnants
of
my
money
were
spent
with
it
the
episode
that
is
to
say
my
sojourn
with
the
frenchwoman
came
to
an
end
and
i
formally
retired
from
the
scene
it
happened
thus
a
week
after
we
had
taken
up
our
abode
in
paris
there
arrived
thither
the
general
he
came
straight
to
see
us
and
thenceforward
lived
with
us
practically
as
our
guest
though
he
had
a
flat
of
his
own
as
well
blanche
met
him
with
merry
badinage
and
laughter
and
even
threw
her
arms
around
him
in
fact
she
managed
it
so
that
he
had
to
follow
everywhere
in
her
train
whether
when
promenading
on
the
boulevards
or
when
driving
or
when
going
to
the
theatre
or
when
paying
calls
and
this
use
which
she
made
of
him
quite
satisfied
the
general
still
of
imposing
appearance
and
presence
as
well
as
of
fair
height
he
had
a
dyed
moustache
and
whiskers
he
had
formerly
been
in
the
cuirassiers
and
a
handsome
though
a
somewhat
wrinkled
face
also
his
manners
were
excellent
and
he
could
carry
a
frockcoat
well
the
more
so
since
in
paris
he
took
to
wearing
his
orders
to
promenade
the
boulevards
with
such
a
man
was
not
only
a
thing
possible
but
also
so
to
speak
a
thing
advisable
and
with
this
programme
the
good
but
foolish
general
had
not
a
fault
to
find
the
truth
is
that
he
had
never
counted
upon
this
programme
when
he
came
to
paris
to
seek
us
out
on
that
occasion
he
had
made
his
appearance
nearly
shaking
with
terror
for
he
had
supposed
that
blanche
would
at
once
raise
an
outcry
and
have
him
put
from
the
door
wherefore
he
was
the
more
enraptured
at
the
turn
that
things
had
taken
and
spent
the
month
in
a
state
of
senseless
ecstasy
already
i
had
learnt
that
after
our
unexpected
departure
from
roulettenberg
he
had
had
a
sort
of
a
fit
that
he
had
fallen
into
a
swoon
and
spent
a
week
in
a
species
of
garrulous
delirium
doctors
had
been
summoned
to
him
but
he
had
broken
away
from
them
and
suddenly
taken
a
train
to
paris
of
course
blanche
reception
of
him
had
acted
as
the
best
of
all
possible
cures
but
for
long
enough
he
carried
the
marks
of
his
affliction
despite
his
present
condition
of
rapture
and
delight
to
think
clearly
or
even
to
engage
in
any
serious
conversation
had
now
become
impossible
for
him
he
could
only
ejaculate
after
each
word
hm
and
then
nod
his
head
in
confirmation
sometimes
also
he
would
laugh
but
only
in
a
nervous
hysterical
sort
of
a
fashion
while
at
other
times
he
would
sit
for
hours
looking
as
black
as
night
with
his
heavy
eyebrows
knitted
of
much
that
went
on
he
remained
wholly
oblivious
for
he
grew
extremely
and
took
to
talking
to
himself
only
blanche
could
awake
him
to
any
semblance
of
life
his
fits
of
depression
and
moodiness
in
corners
always
meant
either
that
he
had
not
seen
her
for
some
while
or
that
she
had
gone
out
without
taking
him
with
her
or
that
she
had
omitted
to
caress
him
before
departing
when
in
this
condition
he
would
refuse
to
say
what
he
wanted
nor
had
he
the
least
idea
that
he
was
thus
sulking
and
moping
next
after
remaining
in
this
condition
for
an
hour
or
two
this
i
remarked
on
two
occasions
when
blanche
had
gone
out
for
the
day
probably
to
see
albert
he
would
begin
to
look
about
him
and
to
grow
uneasy
and
to
hurry
about
with
an
air
as
though
he
had
suddenly
remembered
something
and
must
try
and
find
it
after
which
not
perceiving
the
object
of
his
search
nor
succeeding
in
recalling
what
that
object
had
been
he
would
as
suddenly
relapse
into
oblivion
and
continue
so
until
the
reappearance
of
blanche
merry
wanton
and
laughing
her
strident
laugh
as
she
approached
to
pet
him
and
even
to
kiss
him
though
the
latter
reward
he
seldom
received
once
he
was
so
overjoyed
at
her
doing
so
that
he
burst
into
tears
even
i
myself
was
surprised
from
the
first
moment
of
his
arrival
in
paris
blanche
set
herself
to
plead
with
me
on
his
behalf
and
at
such
times
she
even
rose
to
heights
of
eloquence
saying
that
it
was
for
me
she
had
abandoned
him
though
she
had
almost
become
his
betrothed
and
promised
to
become
so
that
it
was
for
her
sake
he
had
deserted
his
family
that
having
been
in
his
service
i
ought
to
remember
the
fact
and
to
feel
ashamed
to
all
this
i
would
say
nothing
however
much
she
chattered
on
until
at
length
i
would
burst
out
laughing
and
the
incident
would
come
to
an
end
at
first
as
i
have
said
she
had
thought
me
a
fool
but
since
she
had
come
to
deem
me
a
man
of
sense
and
sensibility
in
short
i
had
the
happiness
of
calling
her
better
nature
into
play
for
though
at
first
i
had
not
deemed
her
so
she
was
in
reality
a
woman
after
her
own
fashion
you
are
good
and
clever
she
said
to
me
towards
the
finish
and
my
one
regret
is
that
you
are
also
so
you
will
never
be
a
rich
man
un
vrai
russe
un
kalmuk
she
usually
called
me
several
times
she
sent
me
to
give
the
general
an
airing
in
the
streets
even
as
she
might
have
done
with
a
lacquey
and
her
spaniel
but
i
preferred
to
take
him
to
the
theatre
to
the
bal
mabille
and
to
restaurants
for
this
purpose
she
usually
allowed
me
some
money
though
the
general
had
a
little
of
his
own
and
enjoyed
taking
out
his
purse
before
strangers
once
i
had
to
use
actual
force
to
prevent
him
from
buying
a
phaeton
at
a
price
of
seven
hundred
francs
after
a
vehicle
had
caught
his
fancy
in
the
palais
royal
as
seeming
to
be
a
desirable
present
for
blanche
what
could
she
have
done
with
a
phaeton
and
the
general
possessed
in
the
world
but
a
thousand
francs
the
origin
even
of
those
francs
i
could
never
determine
but
imagined
them
to
have
emanated
from
astley
the
more
so
since
the
latter
had
paid
the
family
hotel
bill
as
for
what
view
the
general
took
of
myself
i
think
that
he
never
divined
the
footing
on
which
i
stood
with
blanche
true
he
had
heard
in
a
dim
sort
of
way
that
i
had
won
a
good
deal
of
money
but
more
probably
he
supposed
me
to
be
acting
as
secretary
or
even
as
a
kind
of
servant
to
his
inamorata
at
all
events
he
continued
to
address
me
in
his
old
haughty
style
as
my
superior
at
times
he
even
took
it
upon
himself
to
scold
me
one
morning
in
particular
he
started
to
sneer
at
me
over
our
matutinal
coffee
though
not
a
man
prone
to
take
offence
he
suddenly
and
for
some
reason
of
which
to
this
day
i
am
ignorant
fell
out
with
me
of
course
even
he
himself
did
not
know
the
reason
to
put
things
shortly
he
began
a
speech
which
had
neither
beginning
nor
ending
and
cried
out
a
batons
rompus
that
i
was
a
boy
whom
he
would
soon
put
to
rights
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
yet
no
one
could
understand
what
he
was
saying
and
at
length
blanche
exploded
in
a
burst
of
laughter
finally
something
appeased
him
and
he
was
taken
out
for
his
walk
more
than
once
however
i
noticed
that
his
depression
was
growing
upon
him
that
he
seemed
to
be
feeling
the
want
of
somebody
or
something
that
despite
blanche
presence
he
was
missing
some
person
in
particular
twice
on
these
occasions
did
he
plunge
into
a
conversation
with
me
though
he
could
not
make
himself
intelligible
and
only
went
on
rambling
about
the
service
his
late
wife
his
home
and
his
property
every
now
and
then
also
some
particular
word
would
please
him
whereupon
he
would
repeat
it
a
hundred
times
in
the
day
even
though
the
word
happened
to
express
neither
his
thoughts
nor
his
feelings
again
i
would
try
to
get
him
to
talk
about
his
children
but
always
he
cut
me
short
in
his
old
snappish
way
and
passed
to
another
subject
yes
yes
my
children
was
all
that
i
could
extract
from
him
yes
you
are
right
in
what
you
have
said
about
them
only
once
did
he
disclose
his
real
feelings
that
was
when
we
were
taking
him
to
the
theatre
and
suddenly
he
exclaimed
my
unfortunate
children
yes
sir
they
are
unfortunate
children
once
too
when
i
chanced
to
mention
polina
he
grew
quite
bitter
against
her
she
is
an
ungrateful
woman
he
exclaimed
she
is
a
bad
and
ungrateful
woman
she
has
broken
up
a
family
if
there
were
laws
here
i
would
have
her
impaled
yes
i
would
as
for
de
griers
the
general
would
not
have
his
name
mentioned
he
has
ruined
me
he
would
say
he
has
robbed
me
and
cut
my
throat
for
two
years
he
was
a
perfect
nightmare
to
me
for
months
at
a
time
he
never
left
me
in
my
dreams
do
not
speak
of
him
again
it
was
now
clear
to
me
that
blanche
and
he
were
on
the
point
of
coming
to
terms
yet
true
to
my
usual
custom
i
said
nothing
at
length
blanche
took
the
initiative
in
explaining
matters
she
did
so
a
week
before
we
parted
il
a
du
chance
she
prattled
for
the
grandmother
is
now
really
ill
and
therefore
bound
to
die
astley
has
just
sent
a
telegram
to
say
so
and
you
will
agree
with
me
that
the
general
is
likely
to
be
her
heir
even
if
he
should
not
be
so
he
will
not
come
amiss
since
in
the
first
place
he
has
his
pension
and
in
the
second
place
he
will
be
content
to
live
in
a
back
room
whereas
i
shall
be
madame
general
and
get
into
a
good
circle
of
society
she
was
always
thinking
of
this
and
become
a
russian
chatelaine
yes
i
shall
have
a
mansion
of
my
own
and
peasants
and
a
million
of
money
at
my
back
but
suppose
he
should
prove
jealous
he
might
demand
all
sorts
of
things
you
know
do
you
follow
me
oh
dear
no
how
ridiculous
that
would
be
of
him
besides
i
have
taken
measures
to
prevent
it
you
need
not
be
alarmed
that
is
to
say
i
have
induced
him
to
sign
notes
of
hand
in
albert
name
consequently
at
any
time
i
could
get
him
punished
is
he
ridiculous
very
well
then
marry
him
and
in
truth
she
did
so
though
the
marriage
was
a
family
one
only
and
involved
no
pomp
or
ceremony
in
fact
she
invited
to
the
nuptials
none
but
albert
and
a
few
other
friends
hortense
cleopatre
and
the
rest
she
kept
firmly
at
a
distance
as
for
the
bridegroom
he
took
a
great
interest
in
his
new
position
blanche
herself
tied
his
tie
and
blanche
herself
pomaded
him
with
the
result
that
in
his
frockcoat
and
white
waistcoat
he
looked
quite
comme
il
faut
il
est
pourtant
tres
comme
il
faut
blanche
remarked
when
she
issued
from
his
room
as
though
the
idea
that
he
was
tres
comme
il
faut
had
impressed
even
her
for
myself
i
had
so
little
knowledge
of
the
minor
details
of
the
affair
and
took
part
in
it
so
much
as
a
supine
spectator
that
i
have
forgotten
most
of
what
passed
on
this
occasion
i
only
remember
that
blanche
and
the
widow
figured
at
it
not
as
de
cominges
but
as
du
placet
why
they
had
hitherto
been
de
cominges
i
do
not
know
i
only
know
that
this
entirely
satisfied
the
general
that
he
liked
the
name
du
placet
even
better
than
he
had
liked
the
name
de
cominges
on
the
morning
of
the
wedding
he
paced
the
salon
in
his
gala
attire
and
kept
repeating
to
himself
with
an
air
of
great
gravity
and
importance
mlle
blanche
du
placet
mlle
blanche
du
placet
du
placet
he
beamed
with
satisfaction
as
he
did
so
both
in
the
church
and
at
the
wedding
breakfast
he
remained
not
only
pleased
and
contented
but
even
proud
she
too
underwent
a
change
for
now
she
assumed
an
air
of
added
dignity
i
must
behave
altogether
differently
she
confided
to
me
with
a
serious
air
yet
mark
you
there
is
a
tiresome
circumstance
of
which
i
had
never
before
thought
which
is
how
best
to
pronounce
my
new
family
name
zagorianski
zagozianski
madame
la
generale
de
sago
madame
la
generale
de
fourteen
consonants
oh
these
infernal
russian
names
the
last
of
them
would
be
the
best
to
use
do
you
think
at
length
the
time
had
come
for
us
to
part
and
blanche
the
egregious
blanche
shed
real
tears
as
she
took
her
leave
of
me
tu
etais
bon
enfant
she
said
with
a
sob
je
te
croyais
bete
et
tu
en
avais
but
it
suited
you
then
having
given
me
a
final
handshake
she
exclaimed
attends
whereafter
running
into
her
boudoir
she
brought
me
thence
two
notes
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
eyes
they
may
come
in
handy
for
you
she
explained
for
though
you
are
a
very
learned
tutor
you
are
a
very
stupid
man
more
than
two
thousand
francs
however
i
am
not
going
to
give
you
for
the
reason
that
if
i
did
so
you
would
gamble
them
all
away
now
nous
serons
toujours
bons
amis
and
if
you
win
again
do
not
fail
to
come
to
me
et
tu
seras
heureux
i
myself
had
still
five
hundred
francs
left
as
well
as
a
watch
worth
a
thousand
francs
a
few
diamond
studs
and
so
on
consequently
i
could
subsist
for
quite
a
length
of
time
without
particularly
bestirring
myself
purposely
i
have
taken
up
my
abode
where
i
am
now
partly
to
pull
myself
together
and
partly
to
wait
for
astley
who
i
have
learnt
will
soon
be
here
for
a
day
or
so
on
business
yes
i
know
that
and
then
and
then
i
shall
go
to
homburg
but
to
roulettenberg
i
shall
not
go
until
next
year
for
they
say
it
is
bad
to
try
one
luck
twice
in
succession
at
a
table
moreover
homburg
is
where
the
best
play
is
carried
on
xvii
it
is
a
year
and
eight
months
since
i
last
looked
at
these
notes
of
mine
i
do
so
now
only
because
being
overwhelmed
with
depression
i
wish
to
distract
my
mind
by
reading
them
through
at
random
i
left
them
off
at
the
point
where
i
was
just
going
to
homburg
my
god
with
what
a
light
heart
comparatively
speaking
did
i
write
the
concluding
lines
though
it
may
be
not
so
much
with
a
light
heart
as
with
a
measure
of
and
unquenchable
hope
at
that
time
had
i
any
doubts
of
myself
yet
behold
me
now
scarcely
a
year
and
a
half
have
passed
yet
i
am
in
a
worse
position
than
the
meanest
beggar
but
what
is
a
beggar
a
fig
for
beggary
i
have
ruined
myself
that
is
all
nor
is
there
anything
with
which
i
can
compare
myself
there
is
no
moral
which
it
would
be
of
any
use
for
you
to
read
to
me
at
the
present
moment
nothing
could
well
be
more
incongruous
than
a
moral
oh
you
persons
who
in
your
unctuous
pride
are
forever
ready
to
mouth
your
maxims
if
only
you
knew
how
fully
i
myself
comprehend
the
sordidness
of
my
present
state
you
would
not
trouble
to
wag
your
tongues
at
me
what
could
you
say
to
me
that
i
do
not
already
know
well
wherein
lies
my
difficulty
it
lies
in
the
fact
that
by
a
single
turn
of
a
roulette
wheel
everything
for
me
has
become
changed
yet
had
things
befallen
otherwise
these
moralists
would
have
been
among
the
first
yes
i
feel
persuaded
of
it
to
approach
me
with
friendly
jests
and
congratulations
yes
they
would
never
have
turned
from
me
as
they
are
doing
now
a
fig
for
all
of
them
what
am
i
i
am
zero
nothing
what
shall
i
be
tomorrow
i
may
be
risen
from
the
dead
and
have
begun
life
anew
for
still
i
may
discover
the
man
in
myself
if
only
my
manhood
has
not
become
utterly
shattered
i
went
i
say
to
homburg
but
afterwards
went
also
to
roulettenberg
as
well
as
to
spa
and
baden
in
which
latter
place
for
a
time
i
acted
as
valet
to
a
certain
rascal
of
a
privy
councillor
by
name
heintze
who
until
lately
was
also
my
master
here
yes
for
five
months
i
lived
my
life
with
lacqueys
that
was
just
after
i
had
come
out
of
roulettenberg
prison
where
i
had
lain
for
a
small
debt
which
i
owed
out
of
that
prison
i
was
bailed
by
by
whom
by
astley
by
polina
i
do
not
know
at
all
events
the
debt
was
paid
to
the
tune
of
two
hundred
thalers
and
i
sallied
forth
a
free
man
but
what
was
i
to
do
with
myself
in
my
dilemma
i
had
recourse
to
this
heintze
who
was
a
young
scapegrace
and
the
sort
of
man
who
could
speak
and
write
three
languages
at
first
i
acted
as
his
secretary
at
a
salary
of
thirty
gulden
a
month
but
afterwards
i
became
his
lacquey
for
the
reason
that
he
could
not
afford
to
keep
a
secretary
only
an
unpaid
servant
i
had
nothing
else
to
turn
to
so
i
remained
with
him
and
allowed
myself
to
become
his
flunkey
but
by
stinting
myself
in
meat
and
drink
i
saved
during
my
five
months
of
service
some
seventy
gulden
and
one
evening
when
we
were
at
baden
i
told
him
that
i
wished
to
resign
my
post
and
then
hastened
to
betake
myself
to
roulette
oh
how
my
heart
beat
as
i
did
so
no
it
was
not
the
money
that
i
valued
what
i
wanted
was
to
make
all
this
mob
of
heintzes
hotel
proprietors
and
fine
ladies
of
baden
talk
about
me
recount
my
story
wonder
at
me
extol
my
doings
and
worship
my
winnings
true
these
were
childish
fancies
and
aspirations
but
who
knows
but
that
i
might
meet
polina
and
be
able
to
tell
her
everything
and
see
her
look
of
surprise
at
the
fact
that
i
had
overcome
so
many
adverse
strokes
of
fortune
no
i
had
no
desire
for
money
for
its
own
sake
for
i
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
i
should
only
squander
it
upon
some
new
blanche
and
spend
another
three
weeks
in
paris
after
buying
a
pair
of
horses
which
had
cost
sixteen
thousand
francs
no
i
never
believed
myself
to
be
a
hoarder
in
fact
i
knew
only
too
well
that
i
was
a
spendthrift
and
already
with
a
sort
of
fear
a
sort
of
sinking
in
my
heart
i
could
hear
the
cries
of
the
croupiers
trente
et
un
rouge
impair
et
passe
quarte
noir
pair
et
manque
how
greedily
i
gazed
upon
the
with
its
scattered
louis
pieces
and
thalers
upon
the
streams
of
gold
as
they
issued
from
the
croupier
hands
and
piled
themselves
up
into
heaps
of
gold
scintillating
as
fire
upon
the
ell
long
rolls
of
silver
lying
around
the
croupier
even
at
a
distance
of
two
rooms
i
could
hear
the
chink
of
that
money
so
much
so
that
i
nearly
fell
into
convulsions
ah
the
evening
when
i
took
those
seventy
gulden
to
the
gaming
table
was
a
memorable
one
for
me
i
began
by
staking
ten
gulden
upon
passe
for
passe
i
had
always
had
a
sort
of
predilection
yet
i
lost
my
stake
upon
it
this
left
me
with
sixty
gulden
in
silver
after
a
thought
i
selected
zero
beginning
by
staking
five
gulden
at
a
time
twice
i
lost
but
the
third
round
suddenly
brought
up
the
desired
coup
i
could
almost
have
died
with
joy
as
i
received
my
one
hundred
and
gulden
indeed
i
have
been
less
pleased
when
in
former
times
i
have
won
a
hundred
thousand
gulden
losing
no
time
i
staked
another
hundred
gulden
upon
the
red
and
won
two
hundred
upon
the
red
and
won
four
hundred
upon
the
black
and
won
eight
hundred
upon
manque
and
won
thus
with
the
addition
of
the
remainder
of
my
original
capital
i
found
myself
possessed
within
five
minutes
of
seventeen
hundred
gulden
ah
at
such
moments
one
forgets
both
oneself
and
one
former
failures
this
i
had
gained
by
risking
my
very
life
i
had
dared
so
to
risk
and
behold
again
i
was
a
member
of
mankind
i
went
and
hired
a
room
i
shut
myself
up
in
it
and
sat
counting
my
money
until
three
in
the
morning
to
think
that
when
i
awoke
on
the
morrow
i
was
no
lacquey
i
decided
to
leave
at
once
for
homburg
there
i
should
neither
have
to
serve
as
a
footman
nor
to
lie
in
prison
half
an
hour
before
starting
i
went
and
ventured
a
couple
of
stakes
no
more
with
the
result
that
in
all
i
lost
fifteen
hundred
florins
nevertheless
i
proceeded
to
homburg
and
have
now
been
there
for
a
month
of
course
i
am
living
in
constant
trepidation
playing
for
the
smallest
of
stakes
and
always
looking
out
for
something
calculating
standing
whole
days
by
the
to
watch
the
play
even
seeing
that
play
in
my
dreams
yet
seeming
the
while
to
be
in
some
way
stiffening
to
be
growing
caked
as
it
were
in
mire
but
i
must
conclude
my
notes
which
i
finish
under
the
impression
of
a
recent
encounter
with
astley
i
had
not
seen
him
since
we
parted
at
roulettenberg
and
now
we
met
quite
by
accident
at
the
time
i
was
walking
in
the
public
gardens
and
meditating
upon
the
fact
that
not
only
had
i
still
some
fifty
gulden
in
my
possession
but
also
i
had
fully
paid
up
my
hotel
bill
three
days
ago
consequently
i
was
in
a
position
to
try
my
luck
again
at
roulette
and
if
i
won
anything
i
should
be
able
to
continue
my
play
whereas
if
i
lost
what
i
now
possessed
i
should
once
more
have
to
accept
a
lacquey
place
provided
that
in
the
alternative
i
failed
to
discover
a
russian
family
which
stood
in
need
of
a
tutor
plunged
in
these
reflections
i
started
on
my
daily
walk
through
the
park
and
forest
towards
a
neighbouring
principality
sometimes
on
such
occasions
i
spent
four
hours
on
the
way
and
would
return
to
homburg
tired
and
hungry
but
on
this
particular
occasion
i
had
scarcely
left
the
gardens
for
the
park
when
i
caught
sight
of
astley
seated
on
a
bench
as
soon
as
he
perceived
me
he
called
me
by
name
and
i
went
and
sat
down
beside
him
but
on
noticing
that
he
seemed
a
little
stiff
in
his
manner
i
hastened
to
moderate
the
expression
of
joy
which
the
sight
of
him
had
called
forth
you
here
he
said
well
i
had
an
idea
that
i
should
meet
you
do
not
trouble
to
tell
me
anything
for
i
know
all
yes
all
in
fact
your
whole
life
during
the
past
twenty
months
lies
within
my
knowledge
how
closely
you
watch
the
doings
of
your
old
friends
i
replied
that
does
you
infinite
credit
but
stop
a
moment
you
have
reminded
me
of
something
was
it
you
who
bailed
me
out
of
roulettenberg
prison
when
i
was
lying
there
for
a
debt
of
two
hundred
gulden
someone
did
so
oh
dear
no
though
i
knew
all
the
time
that
you
were
lying
there
perhaps
you
could
tell
me
who
did
bail
me
out
no
i
am
afraid
i
could
not
what
a
strange
thing
for
i
know
no
russians
at
all
here
so
it
can
not
have
been
a
russian
who
befriended
me
in
russia
we
orthodox
folk
do
go
bail
for
one
another
but
in
this
case
i
thought
it
must
have
been
done
by
some
english
stranger
who
was
not
conversant
with
the
ways
of
the
country
astley
seemed
to
listen
to
me
with
a
sort
of
surprise
evidently
he
had
expected
to
see
me
looking
more
crushed
and
broken
than
i
was
well
he
said
not
very
pleasantly
i
am
none
the
less
glad
to
find
that
you
retain
your
old
independence
of
spirit
as
well
as
your
buoyancy
which
means
that
you
are
vexed
at
not
having
found
me
more
abased
and
humiliated
than
i
am
i
retorted
with
a
smile
astley
was
not
quick
to
understand
this
but
presently
did
so
and
laughed
your
remarks
please
me
as
they
always
did
he
continued
in
those
words
i
see
the
clever
triumphant
and
above
all
things
cynical
friend
of
former
days
only
russians
have
the
faculty
of
combining
within
themselves
so
many
opposite
qualities
yes
most
men
love
to
see
their
best
friend
in
abasement
for
generally
it
is
on
such
abasement
that
friendship
is
founded
all
thinking
persons
know
that
ancient
truth
yet
on
the
present
occasion
i
assure
you
i
am
sincerely
glad
to
see
that
you
are
not
cast
down
tell
me
are
you
never
going
to
give
up
gambling
damn
the
gambling
yes
i
should
certainly
have
given
it
up
were
it
not
that
that
you
are
losing
i
thought
so
you
need
not
tell
me
any
more
i
know
how
things
stand
for
you
have
said
that
last
in
despair
and
therefore
truthfully
have
you
no
other
employment
than
gambling
no
none
whatever
astley
gave
me
a
searching
glance
at
that
time
it
was
ages
since
i
had
last
looked
at
a
paper
or
turned
the
pages
of
a
book
you
are
growing
blase
he
said
you
have
not
only
renounced
life
with
its
interests
and
social
ties
but
the
duties
of
a
citizen
and
a
man
you
have
not
only
renounced
the
friends
whom
i
know
you
to
have
had
and
every
aim
in
life
but
that
of
winning
money
but
you
have
also
renounced
your
memory
though
i
can
remember
you
in
the
strong
ardent
period
of
your
life
i
feel
persuaded
that
you
have
now
forgotten
every
better
feeling
of
that
period
that
your
present
dreams
and
aspirations
of
subsistence
do
not
rise
above
pair
impair
rouge
noir
the
twelve
middle
numbers
and
so
forth
enough
mr
astley
i
cried
with
some
irritation
almost
in
anger
kindly
do
not
recall
to
me
any
more
recollections
for
i
can
remember
things
for
myself
only
for
a
time
have
i
put
them
out
of
my
head
only
until
i
shall
have
rehabilitated
myself
am
i
keeping
my
memory
dulled
when
that
hour
shall
come
you
will
see
me
arise
from
the
dead
then
you
will
have
to
be
here
another
ten
years
he
replied
should
i
then
be
alive
i
will
remind
you
here
on
this
very
bench
of
what
i
have
just
said
in
fact
i
will
bet
you
a
wager
that
i
shall
do
so
say
no
more
i
interrupted
impatiently
and
to
show
you
that
i
have
not
wholly
forgotten
the
past
may
i
enquire
where
mlle
polina
is
if
it
was
not
you
who
bailed
me
out
of
prison
it
must
have
been
she
yet
never
have
i
heard
a
word
concerning
her
no
i
do
not
think
it
was
she
at
the
present
moment
she
is
in
switzerland
and
you
will
do
me
a
favour
by
ceasing
to
ask
me
these
questions
about
her
astley
said
this
with
a
firm
and
even
an
angry
air
which
means
that
she
has
dealt
you
a
serious
wound
i
burst
out
with
an
involuntary
sneer
mlle
polina
he
continued
is
the
best
of
all
possible
living
beings
but
i
repeat
that
i
shall
thank
you
to
cease
questioning
me
about
her
you
never
really
knew
her
and
her
name
on
your
lips
is
an
offence
to
my
moral
feeling
indeed
on
what
subject
then
have
i
a
better
right
to
speak
to
you
than
on
this
with
it
are
bound
up
all
your
recollections
and
mine
however
do
not
be
alarmed
i
have
no
wish
to
probe
too
far
into
your
private
your
secret
affairs
my
interest
in
mlle
polina
does
not
extend
beyond
her
outward
circumstances
and
surroundings
about
them
you
could
tell
me
in
two
words
well
on
condition
that
the
matter
shall
end
there
i
will
tell
you
that
for
a
long
time
mlle
polina
was
ill
and
still
is
so
my
mother
and
sister
entertained
her
for
a
while
at
their
home
in
the
north
of
england
and
thereafter
mlle
polina
grandmother
you
remember
the
mad
old
woman
died
and
left
mlle
polina
a
personal
legacy
of
seven
thousand
pounds
sterling
that
was
about
six
months
ago
and
now
mlle
is
travelling
with
my
sister
family
my
sister
having
since
married
mlle
little
brother
and
sister
also
benefited
by
the
will
and
are
now
being
educated
in
london
as
for
the
general
he
died
in
paris
last
month
of
a
stroke
mlle
blanche
did
well
by
him
for
she
succeeded
in
having
transferred
to
herself
all
that
he
received
from
the
grandmother
that
i
think
concludes
all
that
i
have
to
tell
and
de
griers
is
he
too
travelling
in
switzerland
no
nor
do
i
know
where
he
is
also
i
warn
you
once
more
that
you
had
better
avoid
such
hints
and
ignoble
suppositions
otherwise
you
will
assuredly
have
to
reckon
with
me
what
in
spite
of
our
old
friendship
yes
in
spite
of
our
old
friendship
then
i
beg
your
pardon
a
thousand
times
astley
i
meant
nothing
offensive
to
mlle
polina
for
i
have
nothing
of
which
to
accuse
her
moreover
the
question
of
there
being
anything
between
this
frenchman
and
this
russian
lady
is
not
one
which
you
and
i
need
discuss
nor
even
attempt
to
understand
if
replied
astley
you
do
not
care
to
hear
their
names
coupled
together
may
i
ask
you
what
you
mean
by
the
expressions
frenchman
russian
lady
and
being
anything
between
them
why
do
you
call
them
so
particularly
a
and
a
lady
ah
i
see
you
are
interested
astley
but
it
is
a
long
long
story
and
calls
for
a
lengthy
preface
at
the
same
time
the
question
is
an
important
one
however
ridiculous
it
may
seem
at
the
first
glance
a
frenchman
astley
is
merely
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
with
this
you
as
a
britisher
may
not
agree
with
it
i
also
as
a
russian
may
not
agree
out
of
envy
yet
possibly
our
good
ladies
are
of
another
opinion
for
instance
one
may
look
upon
racine
as
a
hobbledehoy
perfumed
individual
one
may
even
be
unable
to
read
him
and
i
too
may
think
him
the
same
as
well
as
in
some
respects
a
subject
for
ridicule
yet
about
him
astley
there
is
a
certain
charm
and
above
all
things
he
is
a
great
poet
though
one
might
like
to
deny
it
yes
the
frenchman
the
parisian
as
a
national
figure
was
in
process
of
developing
into
a
figure
of
elegance
before
we
russians
had
even
ceased
to
be
bears
the
revolution
bequeathed
to
the
french
nobility
its
heritage
and
now
every
whippersnapper
of
a
parisian
may
possess
manners
methods
of
expression
and
even
thoughts
that
are
above
reproach
in
form
while
all
the
time
he
himself
may
share
in
that
form
neither
in
initiative
nor
in
intellect
nor
in
soul
his
manners
and
the
rest
having
come
to
him
through
inheritance
yes
taken
by
himself
the
frenchman
is
frequently
a
fool
of
fools
and
a
villain
of
villains
per
contra
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
more
worthy
of
confidence
and
respect
than
this
young
russian
lady
de
griers
might
so
mask
his
face
and
play
a
part
as
easily
to
overcome
her
heart
for
he
has
an
imposing
figure
astley
and
this
young
lady
might
easily
take
that
figure
for
his
real
self
for
the
natural
form
of
his
heart
and
soul
instead
of
the
mere
cloak
with
which
heredity
has
dowered
him
and
even
though
it
may
offend
you
i
feel
bound
to
say
that
the
majority
also
of
english
people
are
uncouth
and
unrefined
whereas
we
russian
folk
can
recognise
beauty
wherever
we
see
it
and
are
always
eager
to
cultivate
the
same
but
to
distinguish
beauty
of
soul
and
personal
originality
there
is
needed
far
more
independence
and
freedom
than
is
possessed
by
our
women
especially
by
our
younger
ladies
at
all
events
they
need
more
experience
for
instance
this
mlle
polina
pardon
me
but
the
name
has
passed
my
lips
and
i
can
not
well
recall
it
is
taking
a
very
long
time
to
make
up
her
mind
to
prefer
you
to
monsieur
de
griers
she
may
respect
you
she
may
become
your
friend
she
may
open
out
her
heart
to
you
yet
over
that
heart
there
will
be
reigning
that
loathsome
villain
that
mean
and
petty
usurer
de
griers
this
will
be
due
to
obstinacy
and
to
the
fact
that
de
griers
once
appeared
to
her
in
the
transfigured
guise
of
a
marquis
of
a
disenchanted
and
ruined
liberal
who
was
doing
his
best
to
help
her
family
and
the
frivolous
old
general
and
although
these
transactions
of
his
have
since
been
exposed
you
will
find
that
the
exposure
has
made
no
impression
upon
her
mind
only
give
her
the
de
griers
of
former
days
and
she
will
ask
of
you
no
more
the
more
she
may
detest
the
present
de
griers
the
more
will
she
lament
the
de
griers
of
the
past
even
though
the
latter
never
existed
but
in
her
own
imagination
you
are
a
sugar
refiner
astley
are
you
not
yes
i
belong
to
the
firm
of
lovell
and
then
see
here
on
the
one
hand
you
are
a
sugar
refiner
while
on
the
other
hand
you
are
an
apollo
belvedere
but
the
two
characters
do
not
mix
with
one
another
i
again
am
not
even
a
sugar
refiner
i
am
a
mere
roulette
gambler
who
has
also
served
as
a
lacquey
of
this
fact
mlle
polina
is
probably
well
aware
since
she
appears
to
have
an
excellent
force
of
police
at
her
disposal
you
are
saying
this
because
you
are
feeling
bitter
said
astley
with
cold
indifference
yet
there
is
not
the
least
originality
in
your
words
i
agree
but
therein
lies
the
horror
of
it
all
that
how
trepidation
playing
ever
mean
and
farcical
my
accusations
may
be
they
are
none
the
less
true
but
i
am
only
wasting
words
yes
you
are
for
you
are
only
talking
nonsense
exclaimed
my
companion
his
voice
now
trembling
and
his
eyes
flashing
fire
are
you
aware
he
continued
that
wretched
ignoble
petty
unfortunate
man
though
you
are
it
was
at
her
request
i
came
to
homburg
in
order
to
see
you
and
to
have
a
long
serious
talk
with
you
and
to
report
to
her
your
feelings
and
thoughts
and
hopes
yes
and
your
recollections
of
her
too
indeed
is
that
really
so
i
cried
the
tears
beginning
to
well
from
my
eyes
never
before
had
this
happened
yes
poor
unfortunate
continued
astley
she
did
love
you
and
i
may
tell
you
this
now
for
the
reason
that
now
you
are
utterly
lost
even
if
i
were
also
to
tell
you
that
she
still
loves
you
you
would
none
the
less
have
to
remain
where
you
are
yes
you
have
ruined
yourself
beyond
redemption
once
upon
a
time
you
had
a
certain
amount
of
talent
and
you
were
of
a
lively
disposition
and
your
good
looks
were
not
to
be
despised
you
might
even
have
been
useful
to
your
country
which
needs
men
like
you
yet
you
remained
here
and
your
life
is
now
over
i
am
not
blaming
you
for
this
in
my
view
all
russians
resemble
you
or
are
inclined
to
do
so
if
it
is
not
roulette
then
it
is
something
else
the
exceptions
are
very
rare
nor
are
you
the
first
to
learn
what
a
taskmaster
is
yours
for
roulette
is
not
exclusively
a
russian
game
hitherto
you
have
honourably
preferred
to
serve
as
a
lacquey
rather
than
to
act
as
a
thief
but
what
the
future
may
have
in
store
for
you
i
tremble
to
think
now
you
are
in
want
of
money
i
suppose
then
take
these
ten
louis
more
i
shall
not
give
you
for
you
would
only
gamble
it
away
take
care
of
these
coins
and
farewell
once
more
take
care
of
them
no
astley
after
all
that
has
been
said
i
take
care
of
them
repeated
my
friend
i
am
certain
you
are
still
a
gentleman
and
therefore
i
give
you
the
money
as
one
gentleman
may
give
money
to
another
also
if
i
could
be
certain
that
you
would
leave
both
homburg
and
the
and
return
to
your
own
country
i
would
give
you
a
thousand
pounds
down
to
start
life
afresh
but
i
give
you
ten
louis
instead
of
a
thousand
pounds
for
the
reason
that
at
the
present
time
a
thousand
pounds
and
ten
louis
will
be
all
the
same
to
you
you
will
lose
the
one
as
readily
as
you
will
the
other
take
the
money
therefore
and
yes
i
will
take
it
if
at
the
same
time
you
will
embrace
me
with
pleasure
so
we
parted
on
terms
of
sincere
affection
but
he
was
wrong
if
i
was
hard
and
undiscerning
as
regards
polina
and
de
griers
he
was
hard
and
undiscerning
as
regards
russian
people
generally
of
myself
i
say
nothing
yet
yet
words
are
only
words
i
need
to
act
above
all
things
i
need
to
think
of
switzerland
tomorrow
tomorrow
ah
but
if
only
i
could
set
things
right
tomorrow
and
be
born
again
and
rise
again
from
the
dead
but
no
i
can
not
yet
i
must
show
her
what
i
can
do
even
if
she
should
do
no
more
than
learn
that
i
can
still
play
the
man
it
would
be
worth
it
today
it
is
too
late
but
tomorrow
yet
i
have
a
presentiment
that
things
can
never
be
otherwise
i
have
got
fifteen
louis
in
my
possession
although
i
began
with
fifteen
gulden
if
i
were
to
play
carefully
at
the
start
but
no
no
surely
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
that
yet
why
should
i
not
rise
from
the
dead
i
should
require
at
first
but
to
go
cautiously
and
patiently
and
the
rest
would
follow
i
should
require
but
to
put
a
check
upon
my
nature
for
one
hour
and
my
fortunes
would
be
changed
entirely
yes
my
nature
is
my
weak
point
i
have
only
to
remember
what
happened
to
me
some
months
ago
at
roulettenberg
before
my
final
ruin
what
a
notable
instance
that
was
of
my
capacity
for
resolution
on
the
occasion
in
question
i
had
lost
everything
everything
yet
just
as
i
was
leaving
the
casino
i
heard
another
gulden
give
a
rattle
in
my
pocket
perhaps
i
shall
need
it
for
a
meal
i
thought
to
myself
but
a
hundred
paces
further
on
i
changed
my
mind
and
returned
that
gulden
i
staked
upon
manque
and
there
is
something
in
the
feeling
that
though
one
is
alone
and
in
a
foreign
land
and
far
from
one
own
home
and
friends
and
ignorant
of
whence
one
next
meal
is
to
come
one
is
nevertheless
staking
one
very
last
coin
well
i
won
the
stake
and
in
twenty
minutes
had
left
the
casino
with
a
hundred
and
seventy
gulden
in
my
pocket
that
is
a
fact
and
it
shows
what
a
last
remaining
gulden
can
do
but
what
if
my
heart
had
failed
me
or
i
had
shrunk
from
making
up
my
mind
no
tomorrow
all
shall
be
ended
