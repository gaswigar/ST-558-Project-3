bang
bang
the
pistol
shots
were
almost
simultaneous
a
cow
peacefully
grazing
fifty
yards
away
received
one
of
the
bullets
in
her
back
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
quarrel
all
the
same
neither
of
the
adversaries
was
hit
who
were
these
two
gentlemen
we
do
not
know
although
this
would
be
an
excellent
opportunity
to
hand
down
their
names
to
posterity
all
we
can
say
is
that
the
elder
was
an
englishman
and
the
younger
an
american
and
both
of
them
were
old
enough
to
know
better
so
far
as
recording
in
what
locality
the
inoffensive
ruminant
had
just
tasted
her
last
tuft
of
herbage
nothing
can
be
easier
it
was
on
the
left
bank
of
niagara
not
far
from
the
suspension
bridge
which
joins
the
american
to
the
canadian
bank
three
miles
from
the
falls
the
englishman
stepped
up
to
the
american
i
contend
nevertheless
that
it
was
britannia
and
i
say
it
was
doodle
replied
the
young
american
the
dispute
was
about
to
begin
again
when
one
of
the
seconds
doubtless
in
the
interests
of
the
milk
trade
interposed
suppose
we
say
it
was
doodle
and
britannia
and
adjourn
to
breakfast
this
compromise
between
the
national
airs
of
great
britain
and
the
united
states
was
adopted
to
the
general
satisfaction
the
americans
and
englishmen
walked
up
the
left
bank
of
the
niagara
on
their
way
to
goat
island
the
neutral
ground
between
the
falls
let
us
leave
them
in
the
presence
of
the
boiled
eggs
and
traditional
ham
and
floods
enough
of
tea
to
make
the
cataract
jealous
and
trouble
ourselves
no
more
about
them
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
we
shall
again
meet
with
them
in
this
story
which
was
right
the
englishman
or
the
american
it
is
not
easy
to
say
anyhow
the
duel
shows
how
great
was
the
excitement
not
only
in
the
new
but
also
in
the
old
world
with
regard
to
an
inexplicable
phenomenon
which
for
a
month
or
more
had
driven
everybody
to
distraction
never
had
the
sky
been
so
much
looked
at
since
the
appearance
of
man
on
the
terrestrial
globe
the
night
before
an
aerial
trumpet
had
blared
its
brazen
notes
through
space
immediately
over
that
part
of
canada
between
lake
ontario
and
lake
erie
some
people
had
heard
those
notes
as
yankee
doodle
others
had
heard
them
as
rule
britannia
and
hence
the
quarrel
between
the
which
ended
with
the
breakfast
on
goat
island
perhaps
it
was
neither
one
nor
the
other
of
these
patriotic
tunes
but
what
was
undoubted
by
all
was
that
these
extraordinary
sounds
had
seemed
to
descend
from
the
sky
to
the
earth
what
could
it
be
was
it
some
exuberant
aeronaut
rejoicing
on
that
sonorous
instrument
of
which
the
renommée
makes
such
obstreperous
use
no
there
was
no
balloon
and
there
were
no
aeronauts
some
strange
phenomenon
had
occurred
in
the
higher
zones
of
the
atmosphere
a
phenomenon
of
which
neither
the
nature
nor
the
cause
could
be
explained
today
it
appeared
over
america
hours
afterwards
it
was
over
europe
a
week
later
it
was
in
asia
over
the
celestial
empire
hence
in
every
country
of
the
world
empire
kingdom
or
republic
there
was
anxiety
which
it
was
important
to
allay
if
you
hear
in
your
house
strange
and
inexplicable
noises
do
you
not
at
once
endeavor
to
discover
the
cause
and
if
your
search
is
in
vain
do
you
not
leave
your
house
and
take
up
your
quarters
in
another
but
in
this
case
the
house
was
the
terrestrial
globe
there
are
no
means
of
leaving
that
house
for
the
moon
or
mars
or
venus
or
jupiter
or
any
other
planet
of
the
solar
system
and
so
of
necessity
we
have
to
find
out
what
it
is
that
takes
place
not
in
the
infinite
void
but
within
the
atmospherical
zones
in
fact
if
there
is
no
air
there
is
no
noise
and
as
there
was
a
noise
that
famous
trumpet
to
wit
the
phenomenon
must
occur
in
the
air
the
density
of
which
invariably
diminishes
and
which
does
not
extend
for
more
than
six
miles
round
our
spheroid
naturally
the
newspapers
took
up
the
question
in
their
thousands
and
treated
it
in
every
form
throwing
on
it
both
light
and
darkness
recording
many
things
about
it
true
or
false
alarming
and
tranquillizing
their
readers
as
the
sale
required
and
almost
driving
ordinary
people
mad
at
one
blow
party
politics
dropped
unheeded
and
the
affairs
of
the
world
went
on
none
the
worse
for
it
but
what
could
this
thing
be
there
was
not
an
observatory
that
was
not
applied
to
if
an
observatory
could
not
give
a
satisfactory
answer
what
was
the
use
of
observatories
if
astronomers
who
doubled
and
tripled
the
stars
a
hundred
thousand
million
miles
away
could
not
explain
a
phenomenon
occurring
only
a
few
miles
off
what
was
the
use
of
astronomers
the
observatory
at
paris
was
very
guarded
in
what
it
said
in
the
mathematical
section
they
had
not
thought
the
statement
worth
noticing
in
the
meridional
section
they
knew
nothing
about
it
in
the
physical
observatory
they
had
not
come
across
it
in
the
geodetic
section
they
had
had
no
observation
in
the
meteorological
section
there
had
been
no
record
in
the
calculating
room
they
had
had
nothing
to
deal
with
at
any
rate
this
confession
was
a
frank
one
and
the
same
frankness
characterized
the
replies
from
the
observatory
of
montsouris
and
the
magnetic
station
in
the
park
of
maur
the
same
respect
for
the
truth
distinguished
the
bureau
des
longitudes
the
provinces
were
slightly
more
affirmative
perhaps
in
the
night
of
the
fifth
and
the
morning
of
the
sixth
of
may
there
had
appeared
a
flash
of
light
of
electrical
origin
which
lasted
about
twenty
seconds
at
the
pic
du
midi
this
light
appeared
between
nine
and
ten
in
the
evening
at
the
meteorological
observatory
on
the
puy
de
dome
the
light
had
been
observed
between
one
and
two
in
the
morning
at
mont
ventoux
in
provence
it
had
been
seen
between
two
and
three
at
nice
it
had
been
noticed
between
three
and
four
while
at
the
semnoz
alps
between
annecy
le
bourget
and
le
léman
it
had
been
detected
just
as
the
zenith
was
paling
with
the
dawn
now
it
evidently
would
not
do
to
disregard
these
observations
altogether
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
a
light
had
been
observed
at
different
places
in
succession
at
intervals
during
some
hours
hence
whether
it
had
been
produced
from
many
centers
in
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
or
from
one
center
it
was
plain
that
the
light
must
have
traveled
at
a
speed
of
over
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
an
hour
in
the
united
kingdom
there
was
much
perplexity
the
observatories
were
not
in
agreement
greenwich
would
not
consent
to
the
proposition
of
oxford
they
were
agreed
on
one
point
however
and
that
was
it
was
nothing
at
all
but
said
one
it
was
an
optical
illusion
while
the
other
contended
that
it
was
an
acoustical
illusion
and
so
they
disputed
something
however
was
it
will
be
seen
common
to
both
it
was
an
illusion
between
the
observatory
of
berlin
and
the
observatory
of
vienna
the
discussion
threatened
to
end
in
international
complications
but
russia
in
the
person
of
the
director
of
the
observatory
at
pulkowa
showed
that
both
were
right
it
all
depended
on
the
point
of
view
from
which
they
attacked
the
phenomenon
which
though
impossible
in
theory
was
possible
in
practice
in
switzerland
at
the
observatory
of
sautis
in
the
canton
of
appenzell
at
the
righi
at
the
gäbriss
in
the
passes
of
the
gothard
at
the
bernard
at
the
julier
at
the
simplon
at
zurich
at
somblick
in
the
tyrolean
alps
there
was
a
very
strong
disinclination
to
say
anything
about
what
nobody
could
prove
and
that
was
nothing
but
reasonable
but
in
italy
at
the
meteorological
stations
on
vesuvius
on
etna
in
the
old
casa
inglesi
at
monte
cavo
the
observers
made
no
hesitation
in
admitting
the
materiality
of
the
phenomenon
particularly
as
they
had
seen
it
by
day
in
the
form
of
a
small
cloud
of
vapor
and
by
night
in
that
of
a
shooting
star
but
of
what
it
was
they
knew
nothing
scientists
began
at
last
to
tire
of
the
mystery
while
they
continued
to
disagree
about
it
and
even
to
frighten
the
lowly
and
the
ignorant
who
thanks
to
one
of
the
wisest
laws
of
nature
have
formed
form
and
will
form
the
immense
majority
of
the
inhabitants
astronomers
and
meteorologists
would
soon
have
dropped
the
subject
altogether
had
not
on
the
night
of
the
and
the
observatory
of
kautokeino
at
finmark
in
norway
and
during
the
night
of
the
and
that
of
isfjord
at
spitzbergen
norwegian
one
and
swedish
the
other
found
themselves
agreed
in
recording
that
in
the
center
of
an
aurora
borealis
there
had
appeared
a
sort
of
huge
bird
an
aerial
monster
whose
structure
they
were
unable
to
determine
but
who
there
was
no
doubt
was
showering
off
from
his
body
certain
corpuscles
which
exploded
like
bombs
in
europe
not
a
doubt
was
thrown
on
this
observation
of
the
stations
in
finmark
and
spitzbergen
but
what
appeared
the
most
phenomenal
about
it
was
that
the
swedes
and
norwegians
could
find
themselves
in
agreement
on
any
subject
whatever
there
was
a
laugh
at
the
asserted
discovery
in
all
the
observatories
of
south
america
in
brazil
peru
and
la
plata
and
in
those
of
australia
at
sydney
adelaide
and
melbourne
and
australian
laughter
is
very
catching
to
sum
up
only
one
chief
of
a
meteorological
station
ventured
on
a
decided
answer
to
this
question
notwithstanding
the
sarcasms
that
his
solution
provoked
this
was
a
chinaman
the
director
of
the
observatory
at
which
rises
in
the
center
of
a
vast
plateau
less
than
thirty
miles
from
the
sea
having
an
immense
horizon
and
wonderfully
pure
atmosphere
it
is
possible
said
he
that
the
object
was
an
aviform
apparatus
a
flying
machine
what
nonsense
but
if
the
controversy
was
keen
in
the
old
world
we
can
imagine
what
it
was
like
in
that
portion
of
the
new
of
which
the
united
states
occupy
so
vast
an
area
a
yankee
we
know
does
not
waste
time
on
the
road
he
takes
the
street
that
leads
him
straight
to
his
end
and
the
observatories
of
the
american
federation
did
not
hesitate
to
do
their
best
if
they
did
not
hurl
their
objectives
at
each
other
heads
it
was
because
they
would
have
had
to
put
them
back
just
when
they
most
wanted
to
use
them
in
this
question
the
observatories
of
washington
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
cambridge
in
massachusetts
found
themselves
opposed
by
those
of
dartmouth
college
in
new
hampshire
and
ann
arbor
in
michigan
the
subject
of
their
dispute
was
not
the
nature
of
the
body
observed
but
the
precise
moment
of
its
observation
all
of
them
claimed
to
have
seen
it
the
same
night
the
same
hour
the
same
minute
the
same
second
although
the
trajectory
of
the
mysterious
voyager
took
it
but
a
moderate
height
above
the
horizon
now
from
massachusetts
to
michigan
from
new
hampshire
to
columbia
the
distance
is
too
great
for
this
double
observation
made
at
the
same
moment
to
be
considered
possible
dudley
at
albany
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
west
point
the
military
academy
showed
that
their
colleagues
were
wrong
by
an
elaborate
calculation
of
the
right
ascension
and
declination
of
the
aforesaid
body
but
later
on
it
was
discovered
that
the
observers
had
been
deceived
in
the
body
and
that
what
they
had
seen
was
an
aerolite
this
aerolite
could
not
be
the
object
in
question
for
how
could
an
aerolite
blow
a
trumpet
it
was
in
vain
that
they
tried
to
get
rid
of
this
trumpet
as
an
optical
illusion
the
ears
were
no
more
deceived
than
the
eyes
something
had
assuredly
been
seen
and
something
had
assuredly
been
heard
in
the
night
of
the
and
of
may
a
very
dark
night
the
observers
at
yale
college
in
the
sheffield
science
school
had
been
able
to
take
down
a
few
bars
of
a
musical
phrase
in
d
major
common
time
which
gave
note
for
note
rhythm
for
rhythm
the
chorus
of
the
chant
du
départ
good
said
the
yankee
wags
there
is
a
french
band
well
up
in
the
air
but
to
joke
is
not
to
answer
thus
said
the
observatory
at
boston
founded
by
the
atlantic
iron
works
society
whose
opinions
in
matters
of
astronomy
and
meteorology
began
to
have
much
weight
in
the
world
of
science
then
there
intervened
the
observatory
at
cincinnati
founded
in
on
mount
lookout
thanks
to
the
generosity
of
kilgour
and
known
for
its
micrometrical
measurements
of
double
stars
its
director
declared
with
the
utmost
good
faith
that
there
had
certainly
been
something
that
a
traveling
body
had
shown
itself
at
very
short
periods
at
different
points
in
the
atmosphere
but
what
were
the
nature
of
this
body
its
dimensions
its
speed
and
its
trajectory
it
was
impossible
to
say
it
was
then
a
journal
whose
publicity
is
immense
the
new
york
herald
received
the
anonymous
contribution
hereunder
there
will
be
in
the
recollection
of
most
people
the
rivalry
which
existed
a
few
years
ago
between
the
two
heirs
of
the
begum
of
ragginahra
the
french
doctor
sarrasin
the
city
of
frankville
and
the
german
engineer
schultze
in
the
city
of
steeltown
both
in
the
south
of
oregon
in
the
united
states
it
will
not
have
been
forgotten
that
with
the
object
of
destroying
frankville
herr
schultze
launched
a
formidable
engine
intended
to
beat
down
the
town
and
annihilate
it
at
a
single
blow
still
less
will
it
be
forgotten
that
this
engine
whose
initial
velocity
as
it
left
the
mouth
of
the
monster
cannon
had
been
erroneously
calculated
had
flown
off
at
a
speed
exceeding
by
sixteen
times
that
of
ordinary
projectiles
or
about
four
hundred
and
fifty
miles
an
hour
that
it
did
not
fall
to
the
ground
and
that
it
passed
into
an
aerolitic
stage
so
as
to
circle
for
ever
round
our
globe
why
should
not
this
be
the
body
in
question
very
ingenious
mr
correspondent
on
the
new
york
herald
but
how
about
the
trumpet
there
was
no
trumpet
in
herr
schulze
projectile
so
all
the
explanations
explained
nothing
and
all
the
observers
had
observed
in
vain
there
remained
only
the
suggestion
offered
by
the
director
of
but
the
opinion
of
a
chinaman
the
discussion
continued
and
there
was
no
sign
of
agreement
then
came
a
short
period
of
rest
some
days
elapsed
without
any
object
aerolite
or
otherwise
being
described
and
without
any
trumpet
notes
being
heard
in
the
atmosphere
the
body
then
had
fallen
on
some
part
of
the
globe
where
it
had
been
difficult
to
trace
it
in
the
sea
perhaps
had
it
sunk
in
the
depths
of
the
atlantic
the
pacific
or
the
indian
ocean
what
was
to
be
said
in
this
matter
but
then
between
the
and
of
june
there
came
a
new
series
of
facts
which
could
not
possibly
be
explained
by
the
unaided
existence
of
a
cosmic
phenomenon
in
a
week
the
hamburgers
at
the
top
of
michael
tower
the
turks
on
the
highest
minaret
of
sophia
the
rouennais
at
the

it

one
would

to
listen
to
the
taunts
objurgations
and
vociferations
which
filled
the
lecture
room
for
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
the
room
was
one
of
the
largest
in
the
weldon
institute
the
club
in
walnut
street
philadelphia
pennsylvania
a
the
evening
before
there
had
been
an
election
of
a
lamplighter
occasioning
many
public
manifestations
noisy
meetings
and
even
interchanges
of
blows
resulting
in
an
effervescence
which
had
not
yet
subsided
and
which
would
account
for
some
of
the
excitement
just
exhibited
by
the
members
of
the
weldon
institute
for
this
was
merely
a
meeting
of
balloonists
discussing
the
burning
question
of
the
direction
of
balloons
in
this
great
saloon
there
were
struggling
pushing
gesticulating
shouting
arguing
disputing
a
hundred
balloonists
all
with
their
hats
on
under
the
authority
of
a
president
assisted
by
a
secretary
and
treasurer
they
were
not
engineers
by
profession
but
simply
amateurs
of
all
that
appertained
to
aerostatics
and
they
were
amateurs
in
a
fury
and
especially
foes
of
those
who
would
oppose
to
aerostats
apparatuses
heavier
than
the
air
flying
machines
aerial
ships
or
what
not
that
these
people
might
one
day
discover
the
method
of
guiding
balloons
is
possible
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
their
president
had
considerable
difficulty
in
guiding
them
this
president
well
known
in
philadelphia
was
the
famous
uncle
prudent
prudent
being
his
family
name
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
america
in
the
qualificative
uncle
for
you
can
there
be
uncle
without
having
either
nephew
or
niece
there
they
speak
of
uncle
as
in
other
places
they
speak
of
father
though
the
father
may
have
had
no
children
uncle
prudent
was
a
personage
of
consideration
and
in
spite
of
his
name
was
well
known
for
his
audacity
he
was
very
rich
and
that
is
no
drawback
even
in
the
united
states
and
how
could
it
be
otherwise
when
he
owned
the
greater
part
of
the
shares
in
niagara
falls
a
society
of
engineers
had
just
been
founded
at
buffalo
for
working
the
cataract
it
seemed
to
be
an
excellent
speculation
the
seven
thousand
five
hundred
cubic
meters
that
pass
over
niagara
in
a
second
would
produce
seven
millions
of
horsepower
this
enormous
power
distributed
amongst
all
the
workshops
within
a
radius
of
three
hundred
miles
would
return
an
annual
income
of
three
hundred
million
dollars
of
which
the
greater
part
would
find
its
way
into
the
pocket
of
uncle
prudent
he
was
a
bachelor
he
lived
quietly
and
for
his
only
servant
had
his
valet
frycollin
who
was
hardly
worthy
of
being
the
servant
to
so
audacious
a
master
uncle
prudent
was
rich
and
therefore
he
had
friends
as
was
natural
but
he
also
had
enemies
although
he
was
president
of
the
club
among
others
all
those
who
envied
his
position
amongst
his
bitterest
foes
we
may
mention
the
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
this
was
phil
evans
who
was
also
very
rich
being
the
manager
of
the
wheelton
watch
company
an
important
manufactory
which
makes
every
day
five
hundred
movements
equal
in
every
respect
to
the
best
swiss
workmanship
phil
evans
would
have
passed
for
one
of
the
happiest
men
in
the
world
and
even
in
the
united
states
if
it
had
not
been
for
uncle
prudent
like
him
he
was
in
his
year
like
him
of
invariable
health
like
him
of
undoubted
boldness
they
were
two
men
made
to
understand
each
other
thoroughly
but
they
did
not
for
both
were
of
extreme
violence
of
character
uncle
prudent
was
furiously
hot
phil
evans
was
abnormally
cool
and
why
had
not
phil
evans
been
elected
president
of
the
club
the
votes
were
exactly
divided
between
uncle
prudent
and
him
twenty
times
there
had
been
a
scrutiny
and
twenty
times
the
majority
had
not
declared
for
either
one
or
the
other
the
position
was
embarrassing
and
it
might
have
lasted
for
the
lifetime
of
the
candidates
one
of
the
members
of
the
club
then
proposed
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
this
was
jem
chip
the
treasurer
of
the
weldon
institute
chip
was
a
confirmed
vegetarian
a
proscriber
of
all
animal
nourishment
of
all
fermented
liquors
half
a
mussulman
half
a
brahman
on
this
occasion
jem
chip
was
supported
by
another
member
of
the
club
william
forbes
the
manager
of
a
large
factory
where
they
made
glucose
by
treating
rags
with
sulphuric
acid
a
man
of
good
standing
was
this
william
forbes
the
father
of
two
charming
girls
miss
dorothy
called
doll
and
miss
martha
called
mat
who
gave
the
tone
to
the
best
society
in
philadelphia
it
followed
then
on
the
proposition
of
jem
chip
supported
by
william
forbes
and
others
that
it
was
decided
to
elect
the
president
on
the
center
point
this
mode
of
election
can
be
applied
in
all
cases
when
it
is
desired
to
elect
the
most
worthy
and
a
number
of
americans
of
high
intelligence
are
already
thinking
of
employing
it
in
the
nomination
of
the
president
of
the
republic
of
the
united
states
on
two
boards
of
perfect
whiteness
a
black
line
is
traced
the
length
of
each
of
these
lines
is
mathematically
the
same
for
they
have
been
determined
with
as
much
accuracy
as
the
base
of
the
first
triangle
in
a
trigonometrical
survey
that
done
the
two
boards
were
erected
on
the
same
day
in
the
center
of
the
conference
room
and
the
two
candidates
each
armed
with
a
fine
needle
marched
towards
the
board
that
had
fallen
to
his
lot
the
man
who
planted
his
needle
nearest
the
center
of
the
line
would
be
proclaimed
president
of
the
weldon
institute
the
operation
must
be
done
at
once
no
guide
marks
or
trial
shots
allowed
nothing
but
sureness
of
eye
the
man
must
have
a
compass
in
his
eye
as
the
saying
goes
that
was
all
uncle
prudent
stuck
in
his
needle
at
the
same
moment
as
phil
evans
did
his
then
there
began
the
measurement
to
discover
which
of
the
two
competitors
had
most
nearly
approached
the
center
wonderful
such
had
been
the
precision
of
the
shots
that
the
measures
gave
no
appreciable
difference
if
they
were
not
exactly
in
the
mathematical
center
of
the
line
the
distance
between
the
needles
was
so
small
as
to
be
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
the
meeting
was
much
embarrassed
fortunately
one
of
the
members
truck
milnor
insisted
that
the
measurements
should
be
remade
by
means
of
a
rule
graduated
by
the
micrometrical
machine
of
perreaux
which
can
divide
a
millimeter
into
of
a
millimeter
with
a
diamond
splinter
was
brought
to
bear
on
the
lines
and
on
reading
the
divisions
through
a
microscope
the
following
were
the
results
uncle
prudent
had
approached
the
center
within
less
than
six
of
a
millimeter
phil
evans
was
within
nine
and
that
is
why
phil
evans
was
only
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
whereas
uncle
prudent
was
president
a
difference
of
three
of
a
millimeter
and
on
account
of
it
phil
evans
vowed
against
uncle
prudent
one
of
those
hatreds
which
are
none
the
less
fierce
for
being
latent
chapter
iii
a
visitor
is
announced
the
many
experiments
made
during
this
last
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
have
given
considerable
impetus
to
the
question
of
guidable
balloons
the
cars
furnished
with
propellers
attached
in
to
the
aerostats
of
the
elongated
form
introduced
by
henry
giffard
the
machines
of
dupuy
de
lome
in
of
the
tissandier
brothers
in
and
of
captain
krebs
and
renard
in
yielded
many
important
results
but
if
these
machines
moving
in
a
medium
heavier
than
themselves
maneuvering
under
the
propulsion
of
a
screw
working
at
an
angle
to
the
direction
of
the
wind
and
even
against
the
wind
to
return
to
their
point
of
departure
had
been
really
guidable
they
had
only
succeeded
under
very
favorable
conditions
in
large
covered
halls
their
success
was
perfect
in
a
calm
atmosphere
they
did
very
well
in
a
light
wind
of
five
or
six
yards
a
second
they
still
moved
but
nothing
practical
had
been
obtained
against
a
miller
wind
nine
yards
a
second
the
machines
had
remained
almost
stationary
against
a
fresh
breeze
eleven
yards
a
second
they
would
have
advanced
backwards
in
a
storm
to
yards
a
second
they
would
have
been
blown
about
like
a
feather
in
a
hurricane
sixty
yards
a
second
they
would
have
run
the
risk
of
being
dashed
to
pieces
and
in
one
of
those
cyclones
which
exceed
a
hundred
yards
a
second
not
a
fragment
of
them
would
have
been
left
it
remained
then
even
after
the
striking
experiments
of
captains
krebs
and
renard
that
though
guidable
aerostats
had
gained
a
little
speed
they
could
not
be
kept
going
in
a
moderate
breeze
hence
the
impossibility
of
making
practical
use
of
this
mode
of
aerial
locomotion
with
regards
to
the
means
employed
to
give
the
aerostat
its
motion
a
great
deal
of
progress
had
been
made
for
the
steam
engines
of
henry
giffard
and
the
muscular
force
of
dupuy
de
lome
electric
motors
had
gradually
been
substituted
the
batteries
of
bichromate
of
potassium
of
the
tissandier
brothers
had
given
a
speed
of
four
yards
a
second
the
machines
of
captain
krebs
and
renard
had
developed
a
force
of
twelve
horsepower
and
yielded
a
speed
of
six
and
a
half
yards
per
second
with
regard
to
this
motor
engineers
and
electricians
had
been
approaching
more
and
more
to
that
desideratum
which
is
known
as
a
steam
horse
in
a
watch
case
gradually
the
results
of
the
pile
of
which
captains
krebs
and
renard
had
kept
the
secret
had
been
surpassed
and
aeronauts
had
become
able
to
avail
themselves
of
motors
whose
lightness
increased
at
the
same
time
as
their
power
in
this
there
was
much
to
encourage
those
who
believed
in
the
utilization
of
guidable
balloons
but
yet
how
many
good
people
there
are
who
refuse
to
admit
the
possibility
of
such
a
thing
if
the
aerostat
finds
support
in
the
air
it
belongs
to
the
medium
in
which
it
moves
under
such
conditions
how
can
its
mass
which
offers
so
much
resistance
to
the
currents
of
the
atmosphere
make
its
way
against
the
wind
in
this
struggle
of
the
inventors
after
a
light
and
powerful
motor
the
americans
had
most
nearly
attained
what
they
sought
a
apparatus
in
which
a
new
pile
was
employed
the
composition
of
which
was
still
a
mystery
had
been
bought
from
its
inventor
a
boston
chemist
up
to
then
unknown
calculations
made
with
the
greatest
care
diagrams
drawn
with
the
utmost
exactitude
showed
that
by
means
of
this
apparatus
driving
a
screw
of
given
dimensions
a
displacement
could
be
obtained
of
from
twenty
to
yards
a
second
now
this
was
magnificent
and
it
is
not
dear
said
uncle
prudent
as
he
handed
to
the
inventor
in
return
for
his
formal
receipt
the
last
installment
of
the
hundred
thousand
paper
dollars
he
had
paid
for
his
invention
immediately
the
weldon
institute
set
to
work
when
there
comes
along
a
project
of
practical
utility
the
money
leaps
nimbly
enough
from
american
pockets
the
funds
flowed
in
even
without
its
being
necessary
to
form
a
syndicate
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
came
into
the
club
account
at
the
first
appeal
the
work
began
under
the
superintendence
of
the
most
celebrated
aeronaut
of
the
united
states
harry
tinder
immortalized
by
three
of
his
ascents
out
of
a
thousand
one
in
which
he
rose
to
a
height
of
twelve
thousand
yards
higher
than
gay
lussac
coxwell
sivet
tissandier
glaisher
another
in
which
he
had
crossed
america
from
new
york
to
san
francisco
exceeding
by
many
hundred
leagues
the
journeys
of
nadar
godard
and
others
to
say
nothing
of
that
of
john
wise
who
accomplished
eleven
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
louis
to
jefferson
county
the
third
which
ended
in
a
frightful
fall
from
fifteen
hundred
feet
at
the
cost
of
a
slight
sprain
in
the
right
thumb
while
the
less
fortunate
pilâtre
de
rozier
fell
only
seven
hundred
feet
and
yet
killed
himself
on
the
spot
at
the
time
this
story
begins
the
weldon
institute
had
got
their
work
well
in
hand
in
the
turner
yard
at
philadelphia
there
reposed
an
enormous
aerostat
whose
strength
had
been
tried
by
highly
compressed
air
it
well
merited
the
name
of
the
monster
balloon
how
large
was
nadar
géant
six
thousand
cubic
meters
how
large
was
john
wise
balloon
twenty
thousand
cubic
meters
how
large
was
the
giffard
balloon
at
the
exhibition
thousand
cubic
meters
compare
these
three
aerostats
with
the
aerial
machine
of
the
weldon
institute
whose
volume
amounted
to
forty
thousand
cubic
meters
and
you
will
understand
why
uncle
prudent
and
his
colleagues
were
so
justifiably
proud
of
it
this
balloon
not
being
destined
for
the
exploration
of
the
higher
strata
of
the
atmosphere
was
not
called
the
excelsior
a
name
which
is
rather
too
much
held
in
honor
among
the
citizens
of
america
no
it
was
called
simply
the
and
all
it
had
to
do
was
to
justify
its
name
by
going
ahead
obediently
to
the
wishes
of
its
commander
the
machine
according
to
the
patent
purchased
by
the
weldon
institute
was
nearly
ready
in
less
than
six
weeks
the
would
start
for
its
first
cruise
through
space
but
as
we
have
seen
all
the
mechanical
difficulties
had
not
been
overcome
many
evenings
had
been
devoted
to
discussing
not
the
form
of
its
screw
nor
its
dimensions
but
whether
it
ought
to
be
put
behind
as
the
tissandier
brothers
had
done
or
before
as
captains
krebs
and
renard
had
done
it
is
unnecessary
to
add
that
the
partisans
of
the
two
systems
had
almost
come
to
blows
the
group
of
beforists
were
equaled
in
number
by
the
group
of
behindists
uncle
prudent
who
ought
to
have
given
the
casting
vote
uncle
prudent
brought
up
doubtless
in
the
school
of
professor
buridan
could
not
bring
himself
to
decide
hence
the
impossibility
of
getting
the
screw
into
place
the
dispute
might
last
for
some
time
unless
the
government
interfered
but
in
the
united
states
the
government
meddles
with
private
affairs
as
little
as
it
possibly
can
and
it
is
right
things
were
in
this
state
at
this
meeting
on
the
of
june
which
threatened
to
end
in
a
riot
insults
exchanged
fisticuffs
succeeding
the
insults
cane
thrashings
succeeding
the

revolver
shots
succeeding

when
at

there
occurred
a
diversion
the
porter
of
the
weldon
institute
coolly
and
calmly
like
a
policeman
amid
the
storm
of
the
meeting
approached
the
presidential
desk
on
it
he
placed
a
card
he
awaited
the
orders
that
uncle
prudent
found
it
convenient
to
give
uncle
prudent
turned
on
the
steam
whistle
which
did
duty
for
the
presidential
bell
for
even
the
kremlin
clock
would
have
struck
in
vain
but
the
tumult
slackened
not
then
the
president
removed
his
hat
thanks
to
this
extreme
measure
a
was
obtained
a
communication
said
uncle
prudent
after
taking
a
huge
pinch
from
the
which
never
left
him
speak
up
answered
voices
accidentally
in
agreement
on
this
one
point
a
stranger
my
dear
colleagues
asks
to
be
admitted
to
the
meeting
never
replied
every
voice
he
desires
to
prove
to
us
it
would
appear
continued
uncle
prudent
that
to
believe
in
guiding
balloons
is
to
believe
in
the
absurdest
of
utopias
let
him
in
let
him
in
what
is
the
name
of
this
singular
personage
asked
secretary
phil
evans
robur
replied
uncle
prudent
robur
robur
robur
yelled
the
assembly
and
the
welcome
accorded
so
quickly
to
the
curious
name
was
chiefly
due
to
the
weldon
institute
hoping
to
vent
its
exasperation
on
the
head
of
him
who
bore
it
chapter
iv
in
which
a
new
character
appears
citizens
of
the
united
states
my
name
is
robur
i
am
worthy
of
the
name
i
am
forty
years
old
although
i
look
but
thirty
and
i
have
a
constitution
of
iron
a
healthy
vigor
that
nothing
can
shake
a
muscular
strength
that
few
can
equal
and
a
digestion
that
would
be
thought
first
class
even
in
an
ostrich
they
were
listening
yes
the
riot
was
quelled
at
once
by
the
totally
unexpected
fashion
of
the
speech
was
this
fellow
a
madman
or
a
hoaxer
whoever
he
was
he
kept
his
audience
in
hand
there
was
not
a
whisper
in
the
meeting
in
which
but
a
few
minutes
ago
the
storm
was
in
full
fury
and
robur
looked
the
man
he
said
he
was
of
middle
height
and
geometric
breadth
his
figure
was
a
regular
trapezium
with
the
greatest
of
its
parallel
sides
formed
by
the
line
of
his
shoulders
on
this
line
attached
by
a
robust
neck
there
rose
an
enormous
spheroidal
head
the
head
of
what
animal
did
it
resemble
from
the
point
of
view
of
passional
analogy
the
head
of
a
bull
but
a
bull
with
an
intelligent
face
eyes
which
at
the
least
opposition
would
glow
like
coals
of
fire
and
above
them
a
permanent
contraction
of
the
superciliary
muscle
an
invariable
sign
of
extreme
energy
short
hair
slightly
woolly
with
metallic
reflections
large
chest
rising
and
falling
like
a
smith
bellows
arms
hands
legs
feet
all
worthy
of
the
trunk
no
mustaches
no
whiskers
but
a
large
american
goatee
revealing
the
attachments
of
the
jaw
whose
masseter
muscles
were
evidently
of
formidable
strength
it
has
been
calculated
what
has
not
been
calculated
that
the
pressure
of
the
jaw
of
an
ordinary
crocodile
can
reach
four
hundred
atmospheres
while
that
of
a
hound
can
only
amount
to
one
hundred
from
this
the
following
curious
formula
has
been
deduced
if
a
kilogram
of
dog
produces
eight
kilograms
of
masseteric
force
a
kilogram
of
crocodile
could
produce
twelve
now
a
kilogram
of
the
aforesaid
robur
would
not
produce
less
than
ten
so
that
he
came
between
the
dog
and
the
crocodile
from
what
country
did
this
remarkable
specimen
come
it
was
difficult
to
say
one
thing
was
noticeable
and
that
was
that
he
expressed
himself
fluently
in
english
without
a
trace
of
the
drawling
twang
that
distinguishes
the
yankees
of
new
england
he
continued
and
now
honorable
citizens
for
my
mental
faculties
you
see
before
you
an
engineer
whose
nerves
are
in
no
way
inferior
to
his
muscles
i
have
no
fear
of
anything
or
anybody
i
have
a
strength
of
will
that
has
never
had
to
yield
when
i
have
decided
on
a
thing
all
america
all
the
world
may
strive
in
vain
to
keep
me
from
it
when
i
have
an
idea
i
allow
no
one
to
share
it
and
i
do
not
permit
any
contradiction
i
insist
on
these
details
honorable
citizens
because
it
is
necessary
you
should
quite
understand
me
perhaps
you
think
i
am
talking
too
much
about
myself
it
does
not
matter
if
you
do
and
now
consider
a
little
before
you
interrupt
me
as
i
have
come
to
tell
you
something
that
you
may
not
be
particularly
pleased
to
hear
a
sound
as
of
the
surf
on
the
beach
began
to
rise
along
the
first
row
of
seats
a
sign
that
the
sea
would
not
be
long
in
getting
stormy
again
speak
stranger
said
uncle
prudent
who
had
some
difficulty
in
restraining
himself
and
robur
spoke
as
follows
without
troubling
himself
any
more
about
his
audience
yes
i
know
it
well
after
a
century
of
experiments
that
have
led
to
nothing
and
trials
giving
no
results
there
still
exist
minds
who
believe
in
guiding
balloons
they
imagine
that
a
motor
of
some
sort
electric
or
otherwise
might
be
applied
to
their
pretentious
skin
bags
which
are
at
the
mercy
of
every
current
in
the
atmosphere
they
persuade
themselves
that
they
can
be
masters
of
an
aerostat
as
they
can
be
masters
of
a
ship
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
because
a
few
inventors
in
calm
or
nearly
calm
weather
have
succeeded
in
working
an
angle
with
the
wind
or
even
beating
to
windward
in
a
gentle
breeze
they
think
that
the
steering
of
aerial
apparatus
lighter
than
the
air
is
a
practical
matter
well
now
look
here
you
hundred
who
believe
in
the
realization
of
your
dreams
are
throwing
your
thousands
of
dollars
not
into
water
but
into
space
you
are
fighting
the
impossible
strange
as
it
was
that
at
this
affirmation
the
members
of
the
weldon
institute
did
not
move
had
they
become
as
deaf
as
they
were
patient
or
were
they
reserving
themselves
to
see
how
far
this
audacious
contradictor
would
dare
to
go
robur
continued
what
a
balloon
when
to
obtain
the
raising
of
a
couple
of
pounds
you
require
a
cubic
yard
of
gas
a
balloon
pretending
to
resist
the
wind
by
aid
of
its
mechanism
when
the
pressure
of
a
light
breeze
on
a
vessel
sails
is
not
less
than
that
of
four
hundred
horsepower
when
in
the
accident
at
the
tay
bridge
you
saw
the
storm
produce
a
pressure
of
eight
and
a
half
hundredweight
on
a
square
yard
a
balloon
when
on
such
a
system
nature
has
never
constructed
anything
flying
whether
furnished
with
wings
like
birds
or
membranes
like
certain
fish
or
certain
mammalia
mammalia
exclaimed
one
of
the
members
yes
mammalia
the
bat
which
flies
if
i
am
not
mistaken
is
the
gentleman
unaware
that
this
flyer
is
a
mammal
did
he
ever
see
an
omelette
made
of
bat
eggs
the
interrupter
reserved
himself
for
future
interruption
and
robur
resumed
but
does
that
mean
that
man
is
to
give
up
the
conquest
of
the
air
and
the
transformation
of
the
domestic
and
political
manners
of
the
old
world
by
the
use
of
this
admirable
means
of
locomotion
by
no
means
as
he
has
become
master
of
the
seas
with
the
ship
by
the
oar
the
sail
the
wheel
and
the
screw
so
shall
he
become
master
of
atmospherical
space
by
apparatus
heavier
than
the
air
for
it
must
be
heavier
to
be
stronger
than
the
air
and
then
the
assembly
exploded
what
a
broadside
of
yells
escaped
from
all
these
mouths
aimed
at
robur
like
the
muzzles
of
so
many
guns
was
not
this
hurling
a
declaration
of
war
into
the
very
camp
of
the
balloonists
was
not
this
a
stirring
up
of
strife
between
lighter
and
heavier
than
air
robur
did
not
even
frown
with
folded
arms
he
waited
bravely
till
silence
was
obtained
by
a
gesture
uncle
prudent
ordered
the
firing
to
cease
yes
continued
robur
the
future
is
for
the
flying
machine
the
air
affords
a
solid
fulcrum
if
you
will
give
a
column
of
air
an
ascensional
movement
of
meters
a
second
a
man
can
support
himself
on
the
top
of
it
if
the
soles
of
his
boots
have
a
superficies
of
only
the
eighth
of
a
square
meter
and
if
the
speed
be
increased
to
ninety
meters
he
can
walk
on
it
with
naked
feet
or
if
by
means
of
a
screw
you
drive
a
mass
of
air
at
this
speed
you
get
the
same
result
what
robur
said
had
been
said
before
by
all
the
partisans
of
aviation
whose
work
slowly
but
surely
is
leading
on
to
the
solution
of
the
problem
to

jobert
du

penaud

and
tatin
michael

edison

and
so
many
others
belongs
the
honor
of
having
brought
forward
ideas
of
such
simplicity
abandoned
and
resumed
times
without
number
they
are
sure
some
day
to
triumph
to
the
enemies
of
aviation
who
urge
that
the
bird
only
sustains
himself
by
warming
the
air
he
strikes
their
answer
is
ready
have
they
not
proved
that
an
eagle
weighing
five
kilograms
would
have
to
fill
fifty
cubic
meters
with
his
warm
fluid
merely
to
sustain
himself
in
space
this
is
what
robur
demonstrated
with
undeniable
logic
amid
the
uproar
that
arose
on
all
sides
and
in
conclusion
these
are
the
words
he
hurled
in
the
faces
of
the
balloonists
with
your
aerostats
you
can
do
nothing
you
will
arrive
at
nothing
you
dare
do
nothing
the
boldest
of
your
aeronauts
john
wise
although
he
has
made
an
aerial
voyage
of
twelve
hundred
miles
above
the
american
continent
has
had
to
give
up
his
project
of
crossing
the
atlantic
and
you
have
not
advanced
one
step
not
one
step
towards
your
end
sir
said
the
president
who
in
vain
endeavored
to
keep
himself
cool
you
forget
what
was
said
by
our
immortal
franklin
at
the
first
appearance
of
the
fire
balloon
is
but
a
child
but
it
will
grow
it
was
but
a
child
and
it
has
grown
no
president
it
has
not
grown
it
has
got
fatter
and
this
is
not
the
same
thing
this
was
a
direct
attack
on
the
weldon
institute
which
had
decreed
helped
and
paid
for
the
making
of
a
monster
balloon
and
so
propositions
of
the
following
kind
began
to
fly
about
the
room
turn
him
out
throw
him
off
the
platform
prove
that
he
is
heavier
than
the
air
but
these
were
only
words
not
means
to
an
end
robur
remained
impassible
and
continued
there
is
no
progress
for
your
aerostats
my
citizen
balloonists
progress
is
for
flying
machines
the
bird
flies
and
he
is
not
a
balloon
he
is
a
piece
of
mechanism
yes
he
flies
exclaimed
the
fiery
bat
fynn
but
he
flies
against
all
the
laws
of
mechanics
indeed
said
robur
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
resuming
since
we
have
begun
the
study
of
the
flight
of
large
and
small
birds
one
simple
idea
has
prevailed
to
imitate
nature
which
never
makes
mistakes
between
the
albatross
which
gives
hardly
ten
beats
of
the
wing
per
minute
between
the
pelican
which
gives
seventy
said
the
voice
of
a
scoffer
and
the
bee
which
gives
one
hundred
and
per
second
one
hundred
and
said
the
facetious
individual
and
the
common
house
fly
which
gives
three
hundred
and
thirty
and
a
half
and
the
mosquito
which
gives
millions
no
milliards
but
robur
the
interrupted
interrupted
not
his
demonstration
between
these
different
rates
he
continued
there
is
a
difference
said
a
voice
there
is
a
possibility
of
finding
a
practical
solution
when
de
lucy
showed
that
the
stag
beetle
an
insect
weighing
only
two
grammes
could
lift
a
weight
of
four
hundred
grammes
or
two
hundred
times
its
own
weight
the
problem
of
aviation
was
solved
besides
it
has
been
shown
that
the
wing
surface
decreases
in
proportion
to
the
increase
of
the
size
and
weight
of
the
animal
hence
we
can
look
forward
to
such
contrivances
which
would
never
fly
said
secretary
phil
evans
which
have
flown
and
which
will
fly
said
robur
without
being
in
the
least
disconcerted
and
which
we
can
call
streophores
helicopters
orthopters
or
in
imitation
of
the
word
which
comes
from
call
them
from
by
means
of
which
man
will
become
the
master
of
space
the
helix
ah
the
helix
replied
phil
evans
but
the
bird
has
no
helix
that
we
know
so
said
robur
but
penaud
has
shown
that
in
reality
the
bird
makes
a
helix
and
its
flight
is
helicopteral
and
the
motor
of
the
future
is
the
screw
from
such
a
maladee
saint
helix
keep
us
free
sung
out
one
of
the
members
who
had
accidentally
hit
upon
the
air
from
herold
zampa
and
they
all
took
up
the
chorus
from
such
a
maladee
saint
helix
keep
us
free
with
such
intonations
and
variations
as
would
have
made
the
french
composer
groan
in
his
grave
as
the
last
notes
died
away
in
a
frightful
discord
uncle
prudent
took
advantage
of
the
momentary
calm
to
say
stranger
up
to
now
we
let
you
speak
without
interruption
it
seemed
that
for
the
president
of
the
weldon
institute
shouts
yells
and
catcalls
were
not
interruptions
but
only
an
exchange
of
arguments
but
i
may
remind
you
all
the
same
that
the
theory
of
aviation
is
condemned
beforehand
and
rejected
by
the
majority
of
american
and
foreign
engineers
it
is
a
system
which
was
the
cause
of
the
death
of
the
flying
saracen
at
constantinople
of
the
monk
volador
at
lisbon
of
de
leturn
in
of
de
groof
in
besides
the
victims
i
forget
since
the
mythological
icarus
a
system
replied
robur
no
more
to
be
condemned
than
that
whose
martyrology
contains
the
names
of
pilâtre
de
rozier
at
calais
of
blanchard
at
paris
of
donaldson
and
grimwood
in
lake
michigan
of
sivel
and
of
and
others
whom
it
takes
good
care
to
forget
this
was
a
with
a
vengeance
besides
continued
robur
with
your
balloons
as
good
as
you
can
make
them
you
will
never
obtain
any
speed
worth
mentioning
it
would
take
you
ten
years
to
go
round
the
world
and
a
flying
machine
could
do
it
in
a
week
here
arose
a
new
tempest
of
protests
and
denials
which
lasted
for
three
long
minutes
and
then
phil
evans
look
up
the
word
mr
aviator
he
said
you
who
talk
so
much
of
the
benefits
of
aviation
have
you
ever
aviated
i
have
and
made
the
conquest
of
the
air
not
unlikely
hooray
for
robur
the
conqueror
shouted
an
ironical
voice
well
yes
robur
the
conqueror
i
accept
the
name
and
i
will
bear
it
for
i
have
a
right
to
it
we
beg
to
doubt
it
said
jem
chip
gentlemen
said
robur
and
his
brows
knit
when
i
have
just
seriously
stated
a
serious
thing
i
do
not
permit
anyone
to
reply
to
me
by
a
flat
denial
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
know
the
name
of
the
interrupter
my
name
is
chip
and
i
am
a
vegetarian
citizen
chip
said
robur
i
knew
that
vegetarians
had
longer
alimentary
canals
than
other
men
a
good
foot
longer
at
the
least
that
is
quite
long
enough
and
so
do
not
compel
me
to
make
you
any
longer
by
beginning
at
your
ears
and
throw
him
out
into
the
street
with
him
lynch
him
helix
him
the
rage
of
the
balloonists
burst
forth
at
last
they
rushed
at
the
platform
robur
disappeared
amid
a
sheaf
of
hands
that
were
thrown
about
as
if
caught
in
a
storm
in
vain
the
steam
whistle
screamed
its
fanfares
on
to
the
assembly
philadelphia
might
well
think
that
a
fire
was
devouring
one
of
its
quarters
and
that
all
the
waters
of
the
schuyllkill
could
not
put
it
out
suddenly
there
was
a
recoil
in
the
tumult
robur
had
put
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and

one
of
those
american
institutions
known
as
revolvers
which
the
mere
pressure
of
the
fingers
is
enough
to
fire
pocket
mitrailleuses

fact
and
taking
advantage
not

of
the
recoil

assailants

also
of

chapter
v
another
disappearance
this
was
not
the
first
occasion
on
which
at
the
end
of
their
stormy
discussions
the
members
of
the
weldon
institute
had
filled
walnut
street
and
its
neighborhood
with
their
tumult
several
times
had
the
inhabitants
complained
of
the
noisy
way
in
which
the
proceedings
ended
and
more
than
once
had
the
policemen
had
to
interfere
to
clear
the
thoroughfare
for
the
passersby
who
for
the
most
part
were
supremely
indifferent
on
the
question
of
aerial
navigation
but
never
before
had
the
tumult
attained
such
proportions
never
had
the
complaints
been
better
founded
never
had
the
intervention
of
the
police
been
more
necessary
but
there
was
some
excuse
for
the
members
of
the
weldon
institute
they
had
been
attacked
in
their
own
house
to
these
enthusiasts
for
lighter
than
air
a
no
less
enthusiast
for
heavier
than
air
had
said
things
absolutely
abhorrent
and
at
the
moment
they
were
about
to
treat
him
as
he
deserved
he
had
disappeared
so
they
cried
aloud
for
vengeance
to
leave
such
insults
unpunished
was
impossible
to
all
with
american
blood
in
their
veins
had
not
the
sons
of
amerigo
been
called
the
sons
of
cabot
was
not
that
an
insult
as
unpardonable
as
it
happened
to
be
just
historically
the
members
of
the
club
in
several
groups
rushed
down
walnut
street
then
into
the
adjoining
streets
and
then
all
over
the
neighborhood
they
woke
up
the
householders
they
compelled
them
to
search
their
houses
prepared
to
indemnify
them
later
on
for
the
outrage
on
their
privacy
vain
were
all
their
trouble
and
searching
robur
was
nowhere
to
be
found
there
was
no
trace
of
him
he
might
have
gone
off
in
the
the
balloon
of
the
institute
for
all
they
could
tell
after
an
hour
hunt
the
members
had
to
give
in
and
separate
not
before
they
had
agreed
to
extend
their
search
over
the
whole
territory
of
the
twin
americas
that
form
the
new
continent
by
eleven
quiet
had
been
restored
in
the
neighborhood
of
walnut
street
philadelphia
was
able
to
sink
again
into
that
sound
sleep
which
is
the
privilege
of
towns
the
different
members
of
the
club
parted
to
seek
their
respective
houses
to
mention
the
most
distinguished
amongst
them
william
forbes
sought
his
large
sugar
establishment
where
miss
doll
and
miss
mat
had
prepared
for
him
his
evening
tea
sweetened
with
his
own
glucose
truck
milnor
took
the
road
to
his
factory
in
the
distant
suburb
where
the
engines
worked

and
night
treasurer
jim
chip
publicly
accused
of
possessing
an
alimentary
canal
twelve
inches
longer
than
that
of
other
men
returned
to
the
vegetable
soup
that
was
waiting
for
him
two
of
the
most
important
balloonists
two
only
did
not
seem
to
think
of
returning
so
soon
to
their
domicile
they
availed
themselves
of
the
opportunity
to
discuss
the
question
with
more
than
usual
acrimony
these
were
the
irreconcilables
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
at
the
door
of
the
club
the
valet
frycollin
waited
for
uncle
prudent
his
master
and
at
last
he
went
after
him
though
he
cared
but
little
for
the
subject
which
had
set
the
two
colleagues
at
loggerheads
it
is
only
an
euphemism
that
the
verb
discuss
can
be
used
to
express
the
way
in
which
the
duet
between
the
president
and
secretary
was
being
performed
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
in
full
wrangle
with
an
energy
born
of
their
old
rivalry
no
sir
no
said
phil
evans
if
i
had
had
the
honor
of
being
president
of
the
weldon
institute
there
never
no
never
would
have
been
such
a
scandal
and
what
would
you
have
done
if
you
had
had
the
honor
demanded
uncle
prudent
i
would
have
stopped
the
insulter
before
he
had
opened
his
mouth
it
seems
to
me
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
stop
him
until
he
had
opened
his
mouth
replied
uncle
prudent
not
in
america
sir
not
in
america
and
exchanging
such
observations
increasing
in
bitterness
as
they
went
they
walked
on
through
the
streets
farther
and
farther
from
their
homes
until
they
reached
a
part
of
the
city
whence
they
had
to
go
a
long
way
round
to
get
back
frycollin
followed
by
no
means
at
ease
to
see
his
master
plunging
into
such
deserted
spots
he
did
not
like
deserted
spots
particularly
after
midnight
in
fact
the
darkness
was
profound
and
the
moon
was
only
a
thin
crescent
just
beginning
its
monthly
life
frycollin
kept
a
lookout
to
the
left
and
right
of
him
to
see
if
he
was
followed
and
he
fancied
he
could
see
five
or
six
hulking
follows
dogging
his
footsteps
instinctively
he
drew
nearer
to
his
master
but
not
for
the
world
would
he
have
dared
to
break
in
on
the
conversation
of
which
the
fragments
reached
him
in
short
it
so
chanced
that
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
found
themselves
on
the
road
to
fairmount
park
in
the
full
heat
of
their
dispute
they
crossed
the
schuyllkill
river
by
the
famous
iron
bridge
they
met
only
a
few
belated
wayfarers
and
pressed
on
across
a
wide
open
tract
where
the
immense
prairie
was
broken
every
now
and
then
by
the
patches
of
thick
woodland
which
make
the
park
different
to
any
other
in
the
world
there
frycollin
terror
became
acute
particularly
as
he
saw
the
five
or
six
shadows
gliding
after
him
across
the
schuyllkill
bridge
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
broadened
out
to
the
circumference
of
his
iris
and
his
limbs
seemed
to
diminish
as
if
endowed
with
the
contractility
peculiar
to
the
mollusca
and
certain
of
the
articulate
for
frycollin
the
valet
was
an
egregious
coward
he
was
a
pure
south
carolina
negro
with
the
head
of
a
fool
and
the
carcass
of
an
imbecile
being
only
one
and
twenty
he
had
never
been
a
slave
not
even
by
birth
but
that
made
no
difference
to
him
grinning
and
greedy
and
idle
and
a
magnificent
poltroon
he
had
been
the
servant
of
uncle
prudent
for
about
three
years
over
and
over
again
had
his
master
threatened
to
kick
him
out
but
had
kept
him
on
for
fear
of
doing
worse
with
a
master
ever
ready
to
venture
on
the
most
audacious
enterprises
frycollin
cowardice
had
brought
him
many
arduous
trials
but
he
had
some
compensation
very
little
had
been
said
about
his
gluttony
and
still
less
about
his
laziness
ah
valet
frycollin
if
you
could
only
have
read
the
future
why
oh
why
frycollin
did
you
not
remain
at
boston
with
the
sneffels
and
not
have
given
them
up
when
they
talked
of
going
to
switzerland
was
not
that
a
much
more
suitable
place
for
you
than
this
of
uncle
prudent
where
danger
was
daily
welcomed
but
here
he
was
and
his
master
had
become
used
to
his
faults
he
had
one
advantage
and
that
was
a
consideration
although
he
was
a
negro
by
birth
he
did
not
speak
like
a
negro
and
nothing
is
so
irritating
as
that
hateful
jargon
in
which
all
the
pronouns
are
possessive
and
all
the
verbs
infinitive
let
it
be
understood
then
that
frycollin
was
a
thorough
coward
and
now
it
was
midnight
and
the
pale
crescent
of
the
moon
began
to
sink
in
the
west
behind
the
trees
in
the
park
the
rays
streaming
fitfully
through
the
branches
made
the
shadows
darker
than
ever
frycollin
looked
around
him
anxiously
brrr
he
said
there
are
those
fellows
there
all
the
time
positively
they
are
getting
nearer
master
uncle
he
shouted
it
was
thus
he
called
the
president
of
the
weldon
institute
and
thus
did
the
president
desire
to
be
called
at
the
moment
the
dispute
of
the
rivals
had
reached
its
maximum
and
as
they
hurled
their
epithets
at
each
other
they
walked
faster
and
faster
and
drew
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
schuyllkill
bridge
they
had
reached
the
center
of
a
wide
clump
of
trees
whose
summits
were
just
tipped
by
the
parting
rays
of
the
moon
beyond
the
trees
was
a
very
large
clearing
an
oval
field
a
complete
amphitheater
not
a
hillock
was
there
to
hinder
the
gallop
of
the
horses
not
a
bush
to
stop
the
view
of
the
spectators
and
if
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
had
not
been
so
deep
in
their
dispute
and
had
used
their
eyes
as
they
were
accustomed
to
they
would
have
found
the
clearing
was
not
in
its
usual
state
was
it
a
flour
mill
that
had
anchored
on
it
during
the
night
it
looked
like
it
with
its
wings
and
sails
motionless
and
mysterious
in
the
gathering
gloom
but
neither
the
president
nor
the
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
noticed
the
strange
modification
in
the
landscape
of
fairmount
park
and
neither
did
frycollin
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
thieves
were
approaching
and
preparing
for
their
attack
and
he
was
seized
with
convulsive
fear
paralyzed
in
his
limbs
with
every
hair
he
could
boast
of
on
the
bristle
his
terror
was
extreme
his
knees
bent
under
him
but
he
had
just
strength
enough
to
exclaim
for
the
last
time
master
uncle
master
uncle
what
is
the
matter
with
you
asked
uncle
prudent
perhaps
the
disputants
would
not
have
been
sorry
to
have
relieved
their
fury
at
the
expense
of
the
unfortunate
valet
but
they
had
no
time
and
neither
even
had
he
time
to
answer
a
whistle
was
heard
a
flash
of
electric
light
shot
across
the
clearing
a
signal
doubtless
the
moment
had
come
for
the
deed
of
violence
in
less
time
that
it
takes
to
tell
six
men
came
leaping
across
from
under
the
trees
two
onto
uncle
prudent
two
onto
phil
evans
two
onto
frycollin
there
was
no
need
for
the
last
two
for
the
negro
was
incapable
of
defending
himself
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
although
taken
by
surprise
would
have
resisted
they
had
neither
time
nor
strength
to
do
so
in
a
second
they
were
rendered
speechless
by
a
gag
blind
by
a
bandage
thrown
down
pinioned
and
carried
bodily
off
across
the
clearing
what
could
they
think
except
that
they
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
people
who
intended
to
rob
them
the
people
did
nothing
of
the
sort
however
they
did
not
even
touch
uncle
prudent
pockets
although
according
to
his
custom
they
were
full
of
paper
dollars
within
a
minute
of
the
attack
without
a
word
being
passed
uncle
prudent
phil
evans
and
frycollin
felt
themselves
laid
gently
down
not
on
the
grass
but
on
a
sort
of
plank
that
creaked
beneath
them
they
were
laid
down
side
by
side
a
door
was
shut
and
the
grating
of
a
bolt
in
a
staple
told
them
that
they
were
prisoners
then
there
came
a
continuous
buzzing
a
quivering
a
frrrr
with
the
rrr
unending
and
that
was
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
quiet
of
the
night
great
was
the
excitement
next
morning
in
philadelphia
very
early
was
it
known
what
had
passed
at
the
meeting
of
the
institute
everyone
knew
of
the
appearance
of
the
mysterious
engineer
named
robur
robur
the
conqueror
and
the
tumult
among
the
balloonists
and
his
inexplicable
disappearance
but
it
was
quite
another
thing
when
all
the
town
heard
that
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
club
had
also
disappeared
during
the
night
long
and
keen
was
the
search
in
the
city
and
neighborhood
useless
the
newspapers
of
philadelphia
the
newspapers
of
pennsylvania
the
newspapers
of
the
united
states
reported
the
facts
and
explained
them
in
a
hundred
ways
not
one
of
which
was
the
right
one
heavy
rewards
were
offered
and
placards
were
pasted
up
but
all
to
no
purpose
the
earth
seemed
to
have
opened
and
bodily
swallowed
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
chapter
vi
the
president
and
secretary
suspend
hostilities
a
bandage
over
the
eyes
a
gag
in
the
mouth
a
cord
round
the
wrists
a
cord
round
the
ankles
unable
to
see
to
speak
or
to
move
uncle
prudent
phil
evans
and
frycollin
were
anything
but
pleased
with
their
position
knowing
not
who
had
seized
them
nor
in
what
they
had
been
thrown
like
parcels
in
a
goods
wagon
nor
where
they
were
nor
what
was
reserved
for
them
it
was
enough
to
exasperate
even
the
most
patient
of
the
ovine
race
and
we
know
that
the
members
of
the
weldon
institute
were
not
precisely
sheep
as
far
as
patience
went
with
his
violence
of
character
we
can
easily
imagine
how
uncle
prudent
felt
one
thing
was
evident
that
phil
evans
and
he
would
find
it
difficult
to
attend
the
club
next
evening
as
to
frycollin
with
his
eyes
shut
and
his
mouth
closed
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
think
of
anything
he
was
more
dead
than
alive
for
an
hour
the
position
of
the
prisoners
remained
unchanged
no
one
came
to
visit
them
or
to
give
them
that
liberty
of
movement
and
speech
of
which
they
lay
in
such
need
they
were
reduced
to
stifled
sighs
to
grunts
emitted
over
and
under
their
gags
to
everything
that
betrayed
anger
kept
dumb
and
fury
imprisoned
or
rather
bound
down
then
after
many
fruitless
efforts
they
remained
for
some
time
as
though
lifeless
then
as
the
sense
of
sight
was
denied
them
they
tried
by
their
sense
of
hearing
to
obtain
some
indication
of
the
nature
of
this
disquieting
state
of
things
but
in
vain
did
they
seek
for
any
other
sound
than
an
interminable
and
inexplicable
which
seemed
to
envelop
them
in
a
quivering
atmosphere
at
last
something
happened
phil
evans
regaining
his
coolness
managed
to
slacken
the
cord
which
bound
his
wrists
little
by
little
the
knot
slipped
his
fingers
slipped
over
each
other
and
his
hands
regained
their
usual
freedom
a
vigorous
rubbing
restored
the
circulation
a
moment
after
he
had
slipped
off
the
bandage
which
bound
his
eyes
taken
the
gag
out
of
his
mouth
and
cut
the
cords
round
his
ankles
with
his
knife
an
american
who
has
not
a
in
his
pocket
is
no
longer
an
american
but
if
phil
evans
had
regained
the
power
of
moving
and
speaking
that
was
all
his
eyes
were
useless
to
him
at
present
at
any
rate
the
prison
was
quite
dark
though
about
six
feet
above
him
a
feeble
gleam
of
light
came
in
through
a
kind
of
loophole
as
may
be
imagined
phil
evans
did
not
hesitate
to
at
once
set
free
his
rival
a
few
cuts
with
the
bowie
settled
the
knots
which
bound
him
foot
and
hand
immediately
uncle
prudent
rose
to
his
knees
and
snatched
away
his
bandage
and
gag
thanks
said
he
in
stifled
voice
phil
evans
uncle
prudent
here
we
are
no
longer
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
we
are
adversaries
no
more
you
are
right
answered
evans
we
are
now
only
two
men
agreed
to
avenge
ourselves
on
a
third
whose
attempt
deserves
severe
reprisals
and
this
third
is
robur
it
is
robur
on
this
point
both
were
absolutely
in
accord
on
this
subject
there
was
no
fear
of
dispute
and
your
servant
said
phil
evans
pointing
to
frycollin
who
was
puffing
like
a
grampus
we
must
set
him
free
not
yet
said
uncle
prudent
he
would
overwhelm
us
with
his
jeremiads
and
we
have
something
else
to
do
than
abuse
each
other
what
is
that
uncle
prudent
to
save
ourselves
if
possible
you
are
right
even
if
it
is
impossible
and
even
if
it
is
impossible
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
this
kidnapping
was
due
to
robur
for
an
ordinary
thief
would
have
relieved
them
of
their
watches
jewelry
and
purses
and
thrown
their
bodies
into
the
schuyllkill
with
a
good
gash
in
their
throats
instead
of
throwing
them
to
the
bottom
of
of
what
that
was
a
serious
question
which
would
have
to
be
answered
before
attempting
an
escape
with
any
chance
of
success
phil
evans
began
uncle
prudent
if
when
we
came
away
from
our
meeting
instead
of
indulging
in
amenities
to
which
we
need
not
recur
we
had
kept
our
eyes
more
open
this
would
not
have
happened
had
we
remained
in
the
streets
of
philadelphia
there
would
have
been
none
of
this
evidently
robur
foresaw
what
would
happen
at
the
club
and
had
placed
some
of
his
bandits
on
guard
at
the
door
when
we
left
walnut
street
these
fellows
must
have
watched
us
and
followed
us
and
when
we
imprudently
ventured
into
fairmount
park
they
went
in
for
their
little
game
agreed
said
evans
we
were
wrong
not
to
go
straight
home
it
is
always
wrong
not
to
be
right
said
prudent
here
a
sigh
escaped
from
the
darkest
corner
of
the
prison
what
is
that
asked
evans
nothing
frycollin
is
dreaming
between
the
moment
we
were
seized
a
few
steps
out
into
the
clearing
and
the
moment
we
were
thrown
in
here
only
two
minutes
elapsed
it
is
thus
evident
that
those
people
did
not
take
us
out
of
fairmount
park
and
if
they
had
done
so
we
should
have
felt
we
were
being
moved
undoubtedly
and
consequently
we
must
be
in
some
vehicle
perhaps
some
of
those
long
prairie
wagons
or
some
evidently
for
if
we
were
in
a
boat
moored
on
the
schuyllkill
we
should
have
noticed
the
movement
due
to
the
current
that
is
so
and
as
we
are
still
in
the
clearing
i
think
that
now
is
the
time
to
get
away
and
we
can
return
later
to
settle
with
this
robur
and
make
him
pay
for
this
attempt
on
the
liberty
of
two
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
he
shall
pay
pretty
dearly
but
who
is
this
man
where
does
he
come
from
is
he
english
or
german
or
french
he
is
a
scoundrel
that
is
enough
said
uncle
prudent
now
to
work
and
then
the
two
men
with
their
hands
stretched
out
and
their
fingers
wide
apart
began
to
feel
round
the
walls
to
find
a
joint
or
crack
nothing
nothing
not
even
at
the
door
it
was
closely
shut
and
it
was
impossible
to
shoot
back
the
lock
all
that
could
be
done
was
to
make
a
hole
and
escape
through
the
hole
it
remained
to
be
seen
if
the
knives
could
cut
into
the
walls
but
whence
comes
this
rustling
asked
evans
who
was
much
impressed
at
the
continuous
the
wind
doubtless
said
uncle
prudent
the
wind
but
i
thought
the
night
was
quite
calm
so
it
was
but
if
it
is
the
wind
what
can
it
be
phil
evans
got
out
the
best
blade
of
his
knife
and
set
to
work
on
the
wall
near
the
door
perhaps
he
might
make
a
hole
which
would
enable
him
to
open
it
from
the
outside
should
it
be
only
bolted
or
should
the
key
have
been
left
in
the
lock
he
worked
away
for
some
minutes
the
only
result
was
to
nip
up
his
knife
to
snip
off
its
point
and
transform
what
was
left
of
the
blade
into
a
saw
does
it
cut
asked
uncle
prudent
no
is
the
wall
made
of
sheet
iron
no
it
gives
no
metallic
sound
when
you
hit
it
is
it
of
ironwood
no
it
is
iron
and
it
is
wood
what
is
it
then
impossible
to
say
but
anyhow
steel
does
touch
it
uncle
prudent
in
a
sudden
outburst
of
fury
began
to
rave
and
stamp
on
the
sonorous
planks
while
his
hands
sought
to
strangle
an
imaginary
robur
be
calm
prudent
be
calm
you
have
a
try
uncle
prudent
had
a
try
but
the
could
do
nothing
against
a
wall
which
its
best
blades
could
not
even
scratch
the
wall
seemed
to
be
made
of
crystal
so
it
became
evident
that
all
flight
was
impracticable
except
through
the
door
and
for
a
time
they
must
resign
themselves
to
their
fate
not
a
very
pleasant
thing
for
the
yankee
temperament
and
very
much
to
the
disgust
of
these
eminently
practical
men
but
this
conclusion
was
not
arrived
at
without
many
objurgations
and
phrases
hurled
at
this
robur
who
from
what
had
been
seen
of
him
at
the
weldon
institute
was
not
the
sort
of
man
to
trouble
himself
much
about
them
suddenly
frycollin
began
to
give
unequivocal
signs
of
being
unwell
he
began
to
writhe
in
a
most
lamentable
fashion
either
with
cramp
in
his
stomach
or
in
his
limbs
and
uncle
prudent
thinking
it
his
duty
to
put
an
end
to
these
gymnastics
cut
the
cords
that
bound
him
he
had
cause
to
be
sorry
for
it
immediately
there
was
poured
forth
an
interminable
litany
in
which
the
terrors
of
fear
were
mingled
with
the
tortures
of
hunger
frycollin
was
no
worse
in
his
brain
than
in
his
stomach
and
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
decide
to
which
organ
the
chief
cause
of
the
trouble
should
be
assigned
frycollin
said
uncle
prudent
master
uncle
master
uncle
answered
the
negro
between
two
of
his
lugubrious
howls
it
is
possible
that
we
are
doomed
to
die
of
hunger
in
this
prison
but
we
have
made
up
our
minds
not
to
succumb
until
we
have
availed
ourselves
of
every
means
of
alimentation
to
prolong
our
lives
to
eat
me
exclaimed
frycollin
as
is
always
done
with
a
negro
under
such
circumstances
so
you
had
better
not
make
yourself
too
obvious
or
you
have
your
bones
picked
said
evans
and
as
frycollin
saw
he
might
be
used
to
prolong
two
existences
more
precious
than
his
own
he
contented
himself
thenceforth
with
groaning
in
quiet
the
time
went
on
and
all
attempts
to
force
the
door
or
get
through
the
wall
proved
fruitless
what
the
wall
was
made
of
was
impossible
to
say
it
was
not
metal
it
was
not
wood
it
was
not
stone
and
all
the
cell
seemed
to
be
made
of
the
same
stuff
when
they
stamped
on
the
floor
it
gave
a
peculiar
sound
that
uncle
prudent
found
it
difficult
to
describe
the
floor
seemed
to
sound
hollow
as
if
it
was
not
resting
directly
on
the
ground
of
the
clearing
and
the
inexplicable
seemed
to
sweep
along
below
it
all
of
which
was
rather
alarming
uncle
prudent
said
phil
evans
well
do
you
think
our
prison
has
been
moved
at
all
not
that
i
know
of
because
when
we
were
first
caught
i
distinctly
remember
the
fresh
fragrance
of
the
grass
and
the
resinous
odor
of
the
park
trees
while
now
when
i
take
in
a
good
sniff
of
the
air
it
seems
as
though
all
that
had
gone
so
it
has
why
we
can
not
say
why
unless
we
admit
that
the
prison
has
moved
and
i
say
again
that
if
the
prison
had
moved
either
as
a
vehicle
on
the
road
or
a
boat
on
the
stream
we
should
have
felt
it
here
frycollin
gave
vent
to
a
long
groan
which
might
have
been
taken
for
his
last
had
he
not
followed
it
up
with
several
more
i
expect
robur
will
soon
have
us
brought
before
him
said
phil
evans
i
hope
so
said
uncle
prudent
and
i
shall
tell
him
what
that
he
began
by
being
rude
and
ended
in
being
unbearable
here
phil
evans
noticed
that
day
was
beginning
to
break
a
gleam
still
faint
filtered
through
the
narrow
window
opposite
the
door
it
ought
thus
to
be
about
four
in
the
morning
for
it
is
at
that
hour
in
the
month
of
june
in
this
latitude
that
the
horizon
of
philadelphia
is
tinged
by
the
first
rays
of
the
dawn
but
when
uncle
prudent
sounded
his
repeater
which
was
a
masterpiece
from
his
colleague
factory
the
tiny
gong
only
gave
a
quarter
to
three
and
the
watch
had
not
stopped
that
is
strange
said
phil
evans
at
a
quarter
to
three
it
ought
still
to
be
night
perhaps
my
watch
has
got
slow
answered
uncle
prudent
a
watch
of
the
wheelton
watch
company
exclaimed
phil
evans
whatever
might
be
the
reason
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
day
was
breaking
gradually
the
window
became
white
in
the
deep
darkness
of
the
cell
however
if
the
dawn
appeared
sooner
than
the
fortieth
parallel
permitted
it
did
not
advance
with
the
rapidity
peculiar
to
lower
latitudes
this
was
another
observation
of
uncle
prudent
a
new
inexplicable
phenomenon
could
we
get
up
to
the
window
and
see
where
we
are
we
might
said
uncle
prudent
frycollin
get
up
the
negro
arose
put
your
back
against
the
wall
continued
prudent
and
you
evans
get
on
his
shoulders
while
i
buttress
him
up
right
said
evans
an
instant
afterwards
his
knees
were
on
frycollin
shoulders
and
his
eyes
were
level
with
the
window
the
window
was
not
of
lenticular
glass
like
those
on
shipboard
but
was
a
simple
flat
pane
it
was
small
and
phil
evans
found
his
range
of
view
was
much
limited
break
the
glass
said
prudent
and
perhaps
you
will
be
able
to
see
better
phil
evans
gave
it
a
sharp
knock
with
the
handle
of
his
it
gave
back
a
silvery
sound
but
it
did
not
break
another
and
more
violent
blow
the
same
result
it
is
unbreakable
glass
said
evans
it
appeared
as
though
the
pane
was
made
of
glass
toughened
on
the
siemens
system
as
after
several
blows
it
remained
intact
the
light
had
now
increased
and
phil
evans
could
see
for
some
distance
within
the
radius
allowed
by
the
frame
what
do
you
see
asked
uncle
prudent
nothing
what
not
any
trees
no
not
even
the
top
branches
no
then
we
are
not
in
the
clearing
neither
in
the
clearing
nor
in
the
park
do
you
see
any
roofs
of
houses
or
monuments
said
prudent
whose
disappointment
and
anger
were
increasing
rapidly
no
what
not
a
flagstaff
nor
a
church
tower
nor
a
chimney
nothing
but
space
as
he
uttered
the
words
the
door
opened
a
man
appeared
on
the
threshold
it
was
robur
honorable
balloonists
he
said
in
a
serious
voice
you
are
now
free
to
go
and
come
as
you
like
free
exclaimed
uncle
prudent
yes
within
the
limits
of
the
albatross
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
rushed
out
of
their
prison
and
what
did
they
see
four
thousand
feet
below
them
the
face
of
a
country
they
sought
in
vain
to
recognize
chapter
vii
on
board
the
albatross
when
will
man
cease
to
crawl
in
the
depths
to
live
in
the
azure
and
quiet
of
the
sky
to
this
question
of
camille
flammarion
the
answer
is
easy
it
will
be
when
the
progress
of
mechanics
has
enabled
us
to
solve
the
problem
of
aviation
and
in
a
few
years
as
we
can
foresee
a
more
practical
utilization
of
electricity
will
do
much
towards
that
solution
in
before
the
montgolfier
brothers
had
built
their
and
charles
the
physician
had
devised
his
first
aerostat
a
few
adventurous
spirits
had
dreamt
of
the
conquest
of
space
by
mechanical
means
the
first
inventors
did
not
think
of
apparatus
lighter
than
air
for
that
the
science
of
their
time
did
not
allow
them
to
imagine
it
was
to
contrivances
heavier
than
air
to
flying
machines
in
imitation
of
the
birds
that
they
trusted
to
realize
aerial
locomotion
this
was
exactly
what
had
been
done
by
that
madman
icarus
the
son
of
daedalus
whose
wings
fixed
together
with
wax
had
melted
as
they
approached
the
sun
but
without
going
back
to
mythological
times
without
dwelling
on
archytas
of
tarentum
we
find
in
the
works
of
dante
of
perugia
of
leonardo
da

and

the
idea
of
machines
made
to
move
through

diameter
in
the
shape
of
a
parachute
can
not
only
impede
descent
in
air
but
can
render
it
isochronous
that
is
a
fact
it
is
equally
well
known
that
when
the
speed
is
great
the
work
of
the
weight
varies
in
almost
inverse
ratio
to
the
square
of
the
speed
and
therefore
becomes
almost
insignificant
it
is
also
known
that
as
the
weight
of
a
flying
animal
increases
the
less
is
the
proportional
increase
in
the
surface
beaten
by
the
wings
in
order
to
sustain
it
although
the
motion
of
the
wings
becomes
slower
a
flying
machine
must
therefore
be
constructed
to
take
advantage
of
these
natural
laws
to
imitate
the
bird
that
admirable
type
of
aerial
locomotion
according
to
marcy
of
the
institute
of
france
in
short
the
contrivances
likely
to
solve
the
problem
are
of
three
kinds
helicopters
or
spiralifers
which
are
simply
screws
with
vertical
axes
ornithopters
machines
which
endeavour
to
reproduce
the
natural
flight
of
birds
aeroplanes
which
are
merely
inclined
planes
like
kites
but
towed
or
driven
by
screws
each
of
these
systems
has
had
and
still
has
it
partisans
obstinately
resolved
to
give
way
in
not
the
slightest
particular
however
robur
for
many
reasons
had
rejected
the
two
first
the
ornithopter
or
mechanical
bird
offers
certain
advantages
no
doubt
that
the
work
and
experiments
of
renard
in
have
sufficiently
proved
but
as
has
been
said
it
is
not
necessary
to
copy
nature
servilely
locomotives
are
not
copied
from
the
hare
nor
are
ships
copied
from
the
fish
to
the
first
we
have
put
wheels
which
are
not
legs
to
the
second
we
have
put
screws
which
are
not
fins
and
they
do
not
do
so
badly
besides
what
is
this
mechanical
movement
in
the
flight
of
birds
whose
action
is
so
complex
has
not
doctor
marcy
suspected
that
the
feathers
open
during
the
return
of
the
wings
so
as
to
let
the
air
through
them
and
is
not
that
rather
a
difficult
operation
for
an
artificial
machine
on
the
other
hand
aeroplanes
have
given
many
good
results
screws
opposing
a
slanting
plane
to
the
bed
of
air
will
produce
an
ascensional
movement
and
the
models
experimented
on
have
shown
that
the
disposable
weight
that
is
to
say
the
weight
it
is
possible
to
deal
with
as
distinct
from
that
of
the
apparatus
increases
with
the
square
of
the
speed
herein
the
aeroplane
has
the
advantage
over
the
aerostat
even
when
the
aerostat
is
furnished
with
the
means
of
locomotion
nevertheless
robur
had
thought
that
the
simpler
his
contrivance
the
better
and
the
screws
the
saint
helices
that
had
been
thrown
in
his
teeth
at
the
weldon
institute
had
sufficed
for
all
the
needs
of
his
flying
machine
one
series
could
hold
it
suspended
in
the
air
the
other
could
drive
it
along
under
conditions
that
were
marvelously
adapted
for
speed
and
safety
if
the
ornithopter
striking
like
the
wings
of
a
bird
raised
itself
by
beating
the
air
the
helicopter
raised
itself
by
striking
the
air
obliquely
with
the
fins
of
the
screw
as
it
mounted
on
an
inclined
plane
these
fins
or
arms
are
in
reality
wings
but
wings
disposed
as
a
helix
instead
of
as
a
paddle
wheel
the
helix
advances
in
the
direction
of
its
axis
is
the
axis
vertical
then
it
moves
vertically
is
the
axis
horizontal
then
it
moves
horizontally
the
whole
of
robur
flying
apparatus
depended
on
these
two
movements
as
will
be
seen
from
the
following
detailed
description
which
can
be
divided
under
three
heads
the
platform
the
engines
of
suspension
and
propulsion
and
the
machinery
this
was
a
framework
a
hundred
feet
long
and
twelve
wide
a
ship
deck
in
fact
with
a
projecting
prow
beneath
was
a
hull
solidly
built
enclosing
the
engines
stores
and
provisions
of
all
sorts
including
the
watertanks
round
the
deck
a
few
light
uprights
supported
a
wire
trellis
that
did
duty
for
bulwarks
on
the
deck
were
three
houses
whose
compartments
were
used
as
cabins
for
the
crew
or
as
machine
rooms
in
the
center
house
was
the
machine
which
drove
the
suspensory
helices
in
that
forward
was
the
machine
that
drove
the
bow
screw
in
that
aft
was
the
machine
that
drove
the
stern
screw
in
the
bow
were
the
cook
galley
and
the
crew
quarters
in
the
stern
were
several
cabins
including
that
of
the
engineer
the
saloon
and
above
them
all
a
glass
house
in
which
stood
the
helmsman
who
steered
the
vessel
by
means
of
a
powerful
rudder
all
these
cabins
were
lighted
by
filled
with
toughened
glass
which
has
ten
times
the
resistance
of
ordinary
glass
beneath
the
hull
was
a
system
of
flexible
springs
to
ease
off
the
concussion
when
it
became
advisable
to
land
engines
of
suspension
and
above
the
deck
rose
vertical
axes
fifteen
along
each
side
and
seven
more
elevated
in
the
centre
the
albatross
might
be
called
a
clipper
with
masts
but
these
masts
instead
of
sails
bore
each
two
horizontal
screws
not
very
large
in
spread
or
diameter
but
driven
at
prodigious
speed
each
of
these
axes
had
its
own
movement
independent
of
the
rest
and
each
alternate
one
spun
round
in
a
different
direction
from
the
others
so
as
to
avoid
any
tendency
to
gyration
hence
the
screws
as
they
rose
on
the
vertical
column
of
air
retained
their
equilibrium
by
their
horizontal
resistance
consequently
the
apparatus
was
furnished
with
suspensory
screws
whose
three
branches
were
connected
by
a
metallic
circle
which
economized
their
motive
force
in
front
and
behind
mounted
on
horizontal
axes
were
two
propelling
screws
each
with
four
arms
these
screws
were
of
much
larger
diameter
than
the
suspensory
ones
but
could
be
worked
at
quite
their
speed
in
fact
the
vessel
combined
the
systems
of
cossus
la
landelle
and
ponton
as
perfected
by
robur
but
it
was
in
the
choice
and
application
of
his
motive
force
that
he
could
claim
to
be
an
inventor
robur
had
not
availed
himself
of
the
vapor
of
water
or
other
liquids
nor
compressed
air
and
other
mechanical
motion
he
employed
electricity
that
agent
which
one
day
will
be
the
soul
of
the
industrial
world
but
he
required
no
to
produce
it
all
he
trusted
to
was
piles
and
accumulators
what
were
the
elements
of
these
piles
and
what
were
the
acids
he
used
robur
only
knew
and
the
construction
of
the
accumulators
was
kept
equally
secret
of
what
were
their
positive
and
negative
plates
none
can
say
the
engineer
took
good
care
and
not
unreasonably
to
keep
his
secret
unpatented
one
thing
was
unmistakable
and
that
was
that
the
piles
were
of
extraordinary
strength
and
the
accumulators
left
those
of
very
far
behind
in
yielding
currents
whose
ampères
ran
into
figures
up
to
then
unknown
thus
there
was
obtained
a
power
to
drive
the
screws
and
communicate
a
suspending
and
propelling
force
in
excess
of
all
his
requirements
under
any
circumstances
but
it
is
as
well
to
repeat
it
this
belonged
entirely
to
robur
he
kept
it
a
close
secret
and
if
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
did
not
happen
to
discover
it
it
would
probably
be
lost
to
humanity
it
need
not
be
shown
that
the
apparatus
possessed
sufficient
stability
its
center
of
gravity
proved
that
at
once
there
was
no
danger
of
its
making
alarming
angles
with
the
horizontal
still
less
of
its
capsizing
and
now
for
the
metal
used
by
robur
in
the
construction
of
his
aeronef
a
name
which
can
be
exactly
applied
to
the
albatross
what
was
this
material
so
hard
that
the
of
phil
evans
could
not
scratch
it
and
uncle
prudent
could
not
explain
its
nature
simply
paper
for
some
years
this
fabrication
had
been
making
considerable
progress
unsized
paper
with
the
sheets
impregnated
with
dextrin
and
starch
and
squeezed
in
hydraulic
presses
will
form
a
material
as
hard
as
steel
there
are
made
of
it
pulleys
rails
and
much
more
solid
than
metal
wheels
and
far
lighter
and
it
was
this
lightness
and
solidity
which
robur
availed
himself
of
in
building
his
aerial
locomotive
everything
framework
hull
houses
cabins
were
made
of
turned
hard
as
metal
by
compression
and
what
was
not
to
be
despised
in
an
apparatus
flying
at
great
heights
incombustible
the
different
parts
of
the
engines
and
the
screws
were
made
of
gelatinized
fiber
which
combined
in
sufficient
degree
flexibility
with
resistance
this
material
could
be
used
in
every
form
it
was
insoluble
in
most
gases
and
liquids
acids
or
essences
to
say
nothing
of
its
insulating
properties
and
it
proved
most
valuable
in
the
electric
machinery
of
the
albatross
robur
his
mate
tom
turner
an
engineer
and
two
assistants
two
steersman
and
a
cook
eight
men
all
told
formed
the
crew
of
the
aeronef
and
proved
ample
for
all
the
maneuvers
required
in
aerial
navigation
there
were
arms
of
the

fishing
appliances
electric

compasses
and
sextants
for
checking

in

to
the

did
not
believe
in

of

kind
the

were

the

of

would
not
affect

were

the

chapter
viii
the
balloonists
refuse
to
be
convinced
the
president
of
the
weldon
institute
was
stupefied
his
companion
was
astonished
but
neither
of
them
would
allow
any
of
their
very
natural
amazement
to
be
visible
the
valet
frycollin
did
not
conceal
his
terror
at
finding
himself
borne
through
space
on
such
a
machine
and
he
took
no
pains
whatever
to
hide
it
the
suspensory
screws
were
rapidly
spinning
overhead
fast
as
they
were
going
they
would
have
to
triple
their
speed
if
the
albatross
was
to
ascend
to
higher
zones
the
two
propellers
were
running
very
easily
and
driving
the
ship
at
about
eleven
knots
an
hour
as
they
leaned
over
the
rail
the
passengers
of
the
albatross
could
perceive
a
long
sinuous
liquid
ribbon
which
meandered
like
a
mere
brook
through
a
varied
country
amid
the
gleaming
of
many
lagoons
obliquely
struck
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
the
brook
was
a
river
one
of
the
most
important
in
that
district
along
its
left
bank
was
a
chain
of
mountains
extending
out
of
sight
and
will
you
tell
us
where
we
are
asked
uncle
prudent
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
anger
i
have
nothing
to
teach
you
answered
robur
and
will
you
tell
us
where
we
are
going
asked
phil
evans
through
space
and
how
long
will
that
last
until
it
ends
are
we
going
round
the
world
asked
phil
evans
ironically
further
than
that
said
robur
and
if
this
voyage
does
not
suit
us
asked
uncle
prudent
it
will
have
to
suit
you
that
is
a
foretaste
of
the
nature
of
the
relations
that
were
to
obtain
between
the
master
of
the
albatross
and
his
guests
not
to
say
his
prisoners
manifestly
he
wished
to
give
them
time
to
cool
down
to
admire
the
marvelous
apparatus
which
was
bearing
them
through
the
air
and
doubtless
to
compliment
the
inventor
and
so
he
went
off
to
the
other
end
of
the
deck
leaving
them
to
examine
the
arrangement
of
the
machinery
and
the
management
of
the
ship
or
to
give
their
whole
attention
to
the
landscape
which
was
unrolling
beneath
them
uncle
prudent
said
evans
unless
i
am
mistaken
we
are
flying
over
central
canada
that
river
in
the
northwest
is
the
lawrence
that
town
we
are
leaving
behind
is
quebec
it
was
indeed
the
old
city
of
champlain
whose
zinc
roofs
were
shining
like
reflectors
in
the
sun
the
albatross
must
thus
have
reached
the
degree
of
north
latitude
and
thus
was
explained
the
premature
advance
of
the
day
with
the
abnormal
prolongation
of
the
dawn
yes
said
phil
evans
there
is
the
town
in
its
amphitheater
the
hill
with
its
citadel
the
gibraltar
of
north
america
there
are
the
cathedrals
there
is
the
custom
house
with
its
dome
surmounted
by
the
british
flag
phil
evans
had
not
finished
before
the
canadian
city
began
to
slip
into
the
distance
the
clipper
entered
a
zone
of
light
clouds
which
gradually
shut
off
a
view
of
the
ground
robur
seeing
that
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
had
directed
their
attention
to
the
external
arrangements
of
the
albatross
walked
up
to
them
and
said
well
gentlemen
do
you
believe
in
the
possibility
of
aerial
locomotion
by
machines
heavier
than
air
it
would
have
been
difficult
not
to
succumb
to
the
evidence
but
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
did
not
reply
you
are
silent
continued
the
engineer
doubtless
hunger
makes
you
dumb
but
if
i
undertook
to
carry
you
through
the
air
i
did
not
think
of
feeding
you
on
such
a
poorly
nutritive
fluid
your
first
breakfast
is
waiting
for
you
as
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
were
feeling
the
pangs
of
hunger
somewhat
keenly
they
did
not
care
to
stand
upon
ceremony
a
meal
would
commit
them
to
nothing
and
when
robur
put
them
back
on
the
ground
they
could
resume
full
liberty
of
action
and
so
they
followed
into
a
small
in
the
aftermost
house
there
they
found
a
table
at
which
they
could
take
their
meals
during
the
voyage
there
were
different
preserves
and
among
other
things
was
a
sort
of
bread
made
of
equal
parts
of
flour
and
meat
reduced
to
powder
and
worked
together
with
a
little
lard
which
boiled
in
water
made
excellent
soup
and
there
were
rashers
of
fried
ham
and
for
drink
there
was
tea
neither
had
frycollin
been
forgotten
he
was
taken
forward
and
there
found
some
strong
soup
made
of
this
bread
in
truth
he
had
to
be
very
hungry
to
eat
at
all
for
his
jaws
shook
with
fear
and
almost
refused
to
work
if
it
was
to
break
if
it
was
to
break
said
the
unfortunate
negro
hence
continual
faintings
only
think
a
fall
of
over
four
thousand
feet
which
would
smash
him
to
a
jelly
an
hour
afterwards
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
appeared
on
the
deck
robur
was
no
longer
there
at
the
stem
the
man
at
the
wheel
in
his
glass
cage
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
compass
followed
imperturbably
without
hesitation
the
route
given
by
the
engineer
as
for
the
rest
of
the
crew
breakfast
probably
kept
them
from
their
posts
an
assistant
engineer
examining
the
machinery
went
from
one
house
to
the
other
if
the
speed
of
the
ship
was
great
the
two
colleagues
could
only
estimate
it
imperfectly
for
the
albatross
had
passed
through
the
cloud
zone
which
the
sun
showed
some
four
thousand
feet
below
i
can
hardly
believe
it
said
phil
evans
do
believe
it
said
uncle
prudent
and
going
to
the
bow
they
looked
out
towards
the
western
horizon
another
town
said
phil
evans
do
you
recognize
it
yes
it
seems
to
me
to
be
montreal
montreal
but
we
only
left
quebec
two
hours
ago
that
proves
that
we
must
be
going
at
a
speed
of
miles
an
hour
such
was
the
speed
of
the
aeronef
and
if
the
passengers
were
not
inconvenienced
by
it
it
was
because
they
were
going
with
the
wind
in
a
calm
such
speed
would
have
been
difficult
and
the
rate
would
have
sunk
to
that
of
an
express
in
a
the
speed
would
have
been
unbearable
phil
evans
was
not
mistaken
below
the
albatross
appeared
montreal
easily
recognizable
by
the
victoria
bridge
a
tubular
bridge
thrown
over
the
lawrence
like
the
railway
viaduct
over
the
venice
lagoon
soon
they
could
distinguish
the
town
wide
streets
its
huge
shops
its
palatial
banks
its
cathedral
recently
built
on
the
model
of
peter
at
rome
and
then
mount
royal
which
commands
the
city
and
forms
a
magnificent
park
luckily
phil
evans
had
visited
the
chief
towns
of
canada
and
could
recognize
them
without
asking
robur
after
montreal
they
passed
ottawa
whose
falls
seen
from
above
looked
like
a
vast
cauldron
in
ebullition
throwing
off
masses
of
steam
with
grand
effect
there
is
the
parliament
house
and
he
pointed
out
a
sort
of
nuremburg
toy
planted
on
a
hill
top
this
toy
with
its
polychrome
architecture
resembled
the
house
of
parliament
in
london
much
as
the
montreal
cathedral
resembles
peter
at
rome
but
that
was
of
no
consequence
there
could
be
no
doubt
it
was
ottawa
soon
the
city
faded
off
towards
the
horizon
and
formed
but
a
luminous
spot
on
the
ground
it
was
almost
two
hours
before
robur
appeared
his
mate
tom
turner
accompanied
him
he
said
only
three
words
these
were
transmitted
to
the
two
assistant
engineers
in
the
fore
and
aft
at
a
sign
the
helmsman
changed
of
the
albatross
a
couple
of
points
to
the
southwest
at
the
same
time
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
felt
that
a
greater
speed
had
been
given
to
the
propellers
in
fact
the
speed
had
been
doubled
and
now
surpassed
anything
that
had
ever
been
attained
by
terrestrial
engines
do
their
knots
an
hour
railway
trains
do
their
sixty
miles
an
hour
the
on
the
frozen
hudson
do
their
miles
an
hour
a
machine
built
by
the
patterson
company
with
a
cogged
wheel
has
done
its
eighty
miles
and
another
locomotive
between
trenton
and
jersey
city
has
done
its
but
the
albatross
at
full
speed
could
do
her
hundred
and
twenty
miles
an
hour
or
feet
per
second
this
speed
is
that
of
the
storm
which
tears
up
trees
by
the
roots
it
is
the
mean
speed
of
the
carrier
pigeon
and
is
only
surpassed
by
the
flight
of
the
swallow
feet
per
second
and
that
of
the
swift
feet
per
second
in
a
word
as
robur
had
said
the
albatross
by
using
the
whole
force
of
her
screws
could
make
the
tour
of
the
globe
in
two
hundred
hours
or
less
than
eight
days
is
it
necessary
to
say
so
the
phenomenon
whose
appearance
had
so
much
puzzled
the
people
of
both
worlds
was
the
aeronef
of
the
engineer
the
trumpet
which
blared
its
startling
fanfares
through
the
air
was
that
of
the
mate
tom
turner
the
flag
planted
on
the
chief
monuments
of
europe
asia
america
was
the
flag
of
robur
the
conqueror
and
his
albatross
and
if
up
to
then
the
engineer
had
taken
many
precautions
against
being
recognized
if
by
preference
he
traveled
at
night
clearing
the
way
with
his
electric
lights
and
during
the
day
vanishing
into
the
zones
above
the
clouds
he
seemed
now
to
have
no
wish
to
keep
his
secret
hidden
and
if
he
had
come
to
philadelphia
and
presented
himself
at
the
meeting
of
the
weldon
institute
was
it
not
that
they
might
share
in
his
prodigious
discovery
and
convince
ipso
facto
the
most
incredulous
we
know
how
he
had
been
received
and
we
see
what
reprisals
he
had
taken
on
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
club
again
did
robur
approach
his
prisoners
who
affected
to
be
in
no
way
surprised
at
what
they
saw
of
what
had
succeeded
in
spite
of
them
evidently
beneath
the
cranium
of
these
two
heads
there
was
a
thick
crust
of
obstinacy
which
would
not
be
easy
to
remove
on
his
part
robur
did
not
seem
to
notice
anything
particular
and
coolly
continued
the
conversation
which
he
had
begun
two
hours
before
gentlemen
said
he
you
ask
yourselves
doubtless
if
this
apparatus
so
marvelously
adapted
for
aerial
locomotion
is
susceptible
of
receiving
greater
speed
it
is
not
worth
while
to
conquer
space
if
we
can
not
devour
it
i
wanted
the
air
to
be
a
solid
support
to
me
and
it
is
i
saw
that
to
struggle
against
the
wind
i
must
be
stronger
than
the
wind
and
i
am
i
had
no
need
of
sails
to
drive
me
nor
oars
nor
wheels
to
push
me
nor
rails
to
give
me
a
faster
road
air
is
what
i
wanted
that
was
all
air
surrounds
me
as
it
surrounds
the
submarine
boat
and
in
it
my
propellers
act
like
the
screws
of
a
steamer
that
is
how
i
solved
the
problem
of
aviation
that
is
what
a
balloon
will
never
do
nor
will
any
machine
that
is
lighter
than
air
silence
absolute
on
the
part
of
the
colleagues
which
did
not
for
a
moment
disconcert
the
engineer
he
contented
himself
with
a
and
continued
in
his
interrogative
style
perhaps
you
ask
if
to
this
power
of
the
albatross
to
move
horizontally
there
is
added
an
equal
power
of
vertical
movement
in
a
word
if
when
we
visit
the
higher
zones
of
the
atmosphere
we
can
compete
with
an
aerostat
well
i
should
not
advise
you
to
enter
the
against
her
the
two
colleagues
shrugged
their
shoulders
that
was
probably
what
the
engineer
was
waiting
for
robur
made
a
sign
the
propelling
screws
immediately
stopped
and
after
running
for
a
mile
the
albatross
pulled
up
motionless
at
a
second
gesture
from
robur
the
suspensory
helices
revolved
at
a
speed
that
can
only
be
compared
to
that
of
a
siren
in
acoustical
experiments
their
rose
nearly
an
octave
in
the
scale
of
sound
diminishing
gradually
in
intensity
as
the
air
became
more
rarified
and
the
machine
rose
vertically
like
a
lark
singing
his
song
in
space
master
master
shouted
frycollin
see
that
it
does
break
a
smile
of
disdain
was
robur
only
reply
in
a
few
minutes
the
albatross
had
attained
the
height
of
feet
and
extended
the
range
of
vision
by
seventy
miles
the
barometer
having
fallen
millimeters
then
the
albatross
descended
the
diminution
of
the
pressure
in
high
altitudes
leads
to
the
diminution
of
oxygen
in
the
air
and
consequently
in
the
blood
this
has
been
the
cause
of
several
serious
accidents
which
have
happened
to
aeronauts
and
robur
saw
no
reason
to
run
any
risk
the
albatross
thus
returned
to
the
height
she
seemed
to
prefer
and
her
propellers
beginning
again
drove
her
off
to
the
southwest
now
sirs
if
that
is
what
you
wanted
you
can
reply
then
leaning
over
the
rail
he
remained
absorbed
in
contemplation
when
he
raised
his
head
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
stood
by
his
side
engineer
robur
said
uncle
prudent
in
vain
endeavoring
to
control
himself
we
have
nothing
to
ask
about
what
you
seem
to
believe
but
we
wish
to
ask
you
a
question
which
we
think
you
would
do
well
to
answer
speak
by
what
right
did
you
attack
us
in
philadelphia
in
fairmount
park
by
what
right
did
you
shut
us
up
in
that
prison
by
what
right
have
you
brought
us
against
our
will
on
board
this
flying
machine
and
by
what
right
messieurs
balloonists
did
you
insult
and
threaten
me
in
your
club
in
such
a
way
that
i
am
astonished
i
came
out
of
it
alive
to
ask
is
not
to
answer
said
phil
evans
and
i
repeat
by
what
right
do
you
wish
to
know
if
you
please
well
by
the
right
of
the
strongest
that
is
cynical
but
it
is
true
and
for
how
long
citizen
engineer
asked
uncle
prudent
who
was
nearly
exploding
for
how
long
do
you
intend
to
exercise
that
right
how
can
you
said
robur
ironically
how
can
you
ask
me
such
a
question
when
you
have
only
to
cast
down
your
eyes
to
enjoy
a
spectacle
unparalleled
in
the
world
the
albatross
was
then
sweeping
across
the
immense
expanse
of
lake
ontario
she
had
just
crossed
the
country
so
poetically
described
by
cooper
then
she
followed
the
southern
shore
and
headed
for
the
celebrated
river
which
pours
into
it
the
waters
of
lake
erie
breaking
them
to
powder
in
its
cataracts
in
an
instant
a
majestic
sound
a
roar
as
of
the
tempest
mounted
towards
them
and
as
if
a
humid
fog
had
been
projected
into
the
air
the
atmosphere
sensibly
freshened
below
were
the
liquid
masses
they
seemed
like
an
enormous
flowing
sheet
of
crystal
amid
a
thousand
rainbows
due
to
refraction
as
it
decomposed
the
solar
rays
the
sight
was
sublime
before
the
falls
a
stretching
like
a
thread
united
one
bank
to
the
other
three
miles
below
was
a
across
which
a
train
was
crawling
from
the
canadian
to
the
american
bank
the
falls
of
niagara
exclaimed
phil
evans
and
as
the
exclamation
escaped
him
uncle
prudent
was
doing
all
could
do
to
admire
nothing
of
these
wonders
a
minute
afterwards
the
albatross
had
crossed
the
river
which
separates
the
united
states
from
canada
and
was
flying
over
the
vast
territories
of
the
west
chapter
ix
across
the
prairie
in
one
of
the
cabins
of
the
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
had
found
two
excellent
berths
with
clean
linen
change
of
clothes
and
and
rugs
no
atlantic
liner
could
have
offered
them
more
comfort
if
they
did
not
sleep
soundly
it
was
that
they
did
not
wish
to
do
so
or
rather
that
their
very
real
anxiety
prevented
them
in
what
adventure
had
they
embarked
to
what
series
of
experiments
had
they
been
invited
how
would
the
business
end
and
above
all
what
was
robur
going
to
do
with
them
frycollin
the
valet
was
quartered
forward
in
a
cabin
adjoining
that
of
the
cook
the
neighborhood
did
not
displease
him
he
liked
to
rub
shoulders
with
the
great
in
this
world
but
if
he
finally
went
to
sleep
it
was
to
dream
of
fall
after
fall
of
projections
through
space
which
made
his
sleep
a
horrible
nightmare
however
nothing
could
be
quieter
than
this
journey
through
the
atmosphere
whose
currents
had
grown
weaker
with
the
evening
beyond
the
rustling
of
the
blades
of
the
screws
there
was
not
a
sound
except
now
and
then
the
whistle
from
some
terrestrial
locomotive
or
the
calling
of
some
animal
strange
instinct
these
terrestrial
beings
felt
the
aeronef
glide
over
them
and
uttered
cries
of
terror
as
it
passed
on
the
morrow
the
of
june
at
five
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
were
walking
on
the
deck
of
the
albatross
nothing
had
changed
since
the
evening
there
was
a
lookout
forward
and
the
helmsman
was
in
his
glass
cage
why
was
there
a
was
there
any
chance
of
collision
with
another
such
machine
certainly
not
robur
had
not
yet
found
imitators
the
chance
of
encountering
an
aerostat
gliding
through
the
air
was
too
remote
to
be
regarded
in
any
case
it
would
be
all
the
worse
for
the
aerostat
the
earthen
pot
and
the
iron
pot
the
albatross
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
collision
but
what
could
happen
the
aeronef
might
find
herself
like
a
ship
on
a
lee
shore
if
a
mountain
that
could
not
be
outflanked
or
passed
barred
the
way
these
are
the
reefs
of
the
air
and
they
have
to
be
avoided
as
a
ship
avoids
the
reefs
of
the
sea
the
engineer
it
is
true
had
given
the
course
and
in
doing
so
had
taken
into
account
the
altitude
necessary
to
clear
the
summits
of
the
high
lands
in
the
district
but
as
the
aeronef
was
rapidly
nearing
a
mountainous
country
it
was
only
prudent
to
keep
a
good
lookout
in
case
some
slight
deviation
from
the
course
became
necessary
looking
at
the
country
beneath
them
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
noticed
a
large
lake
whose
lower
southern
end
the
albatross
had
just
reached
they
concluded
therefore
that
during
the
night
the
whole
length
of
lake
erie
had
been
traversed
and
that
as
they
were
going
due
west
they
would
soon
be
over
lake
michigan
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
said
phil
evans
and
that
group
of
roofs
on
the
horizon
is
chicago
he
was
right
it
was
indeed
the
city
from
which
the
seventeen
railways
diverge
the
queen
of
the
west
the
vast
reservoir
into
which
flow
the
products
of
indiana
ohio
wisconsin
missouri
and
all
the
states
which
form
the
western
half
of
the
union
uncle
prudent
through
an
excellent
telescope
he
had
found
in
his
cabin
easily
recognized
the
principal
buildings
his
colleague
pointed
out
to
him
the
churches
and
public
edifices
the
numerous
elevators
or
mechanical
granaries
and
the
huge
sherman
hotel
whose
windows
seemed
like
a
hundred
glittering
points
on
each
of
its
faces
if
that
is
chicago
said
uncle
prudent
it
is
obvious
that
we
are
going
farther
west
than
is
convenient
for
us
if
we
are
to
return
to
our
and
in
fact
the
albatross
was
traveling
in
a
straight
line
from
the
pennsylvania
capital
but
if
uncle
prudent
wished
to
ask
robur
to
take
him
eastwards
he
could
not
then
do
so
that
morning
the
engineer
did
not
leave
his
cabin
either
he
was
occupied
in
some
work
or
else
he
was
asleep
and
the
two
colleagues
sat
down
to
breakfast
without
seeing
him
the
speed
was
the
same
as
that
during
last
evening
the
wind
being
easterly
the
rate
was
not
interfered
with
at
all
and
as
the
thermometer
only
falls
a
degree
centigrade
for
every
seventy
meters
of
elevation
the
temperature
was
not
insupportable
and
so
in
chatting
and
thinking
and
waiting
for
the
engineer
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
walked
about
beneath
the
forest
of
screws
whose
gyratory
movement
gave
their
arms
the
appearance
of
disks
the
state
of
illinois
was
left
by
its
northern
frontier
in
less
than
two
hours
and
a
half
and
they
crossed
the
father
of
waters
the
mississippi
whose
seemed
no
bigger
than
canoes
then
the
albatross
flew
over
iowa
after
having
sighted
iowa
city
about
eleven
in
the
morning
a
few
chains
of
hills
bluffs
as
they
are
called
curved
across
the
face
of
the
country
trending
from
the
south
to
the
northwest
whose
moderate
height
necessitated
no
rise
in
the
course
of
the
aeronef
soon
the
bluffs
gave
place
to
the
large
plains
of
western
iowa
and
nebraska
immense
prairies
extending
all
the
way
to
the
foot
of
the
rocky
mountains
here
and
there
were
many
rios
affluents
or
minor
affluents
of
the
missouri
on
their
banks
were
towns
and
villages
growing
more
scattered
as
the
albatross
sped
farther
west
nothing
particular
happened
during
this
day
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
were
left
entirely
to
themselves
they
hardly
noticed
frycollin
sprawling
at
full
length
in
the
bow
keeping
his
eyes
shut
so
that
he
could
see
nothing
and
they
were
not
attacked
by
vertigo
as
might
have
been
expected
there
was
no
guiding
mark
and
there
was
nothing
to
cause
the
vertigo
as
there
would
have
been
on
the
top
of
a
lofty
building
the
abyss
has
no
attractive
power
when
it
is
gazed
at
from
the
car
of
a
balloon
or
deck
of
an
aeronef
it
is
not
an
abyss
that
opens
beneath
the
aeronaut
but
an
horizon
that
rises
round
him
on
all
sides
like
a
cup
in
a
couple
of
hours
the
albatross
was
over
omaha
on
the
nebraskan
frontier
omaha
city
the
real
head
of
the
pacific
railway
that
long
line
of
rails
four
thousand
five
hundred
miles
in
length
stretching
from
new
york
to
san
francisco
for
a
moment
they
could
see
the
yellow
waters
of
the
missouri
then
the
town
with
its
houses
of
wood

in
the
center
of
a
rich
basin
like
a
buckle
in
the
iron
belt
which
clasps
north
america
round
the
waist
doubtless
also
as
the
passengers
in
the
aeronef
could
observe
all
these
details
the
inhabitants
of
omaha
noticed
the
strange
machine
their
astonishment
at
seeing
it
gliding
overhead
could
be
no
greater
than
that
of
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
at
finding
themselves
on
board
anyhow
the
journals
of
the
union
would
be
certain
to
notice
the
fact
it
would
be
the
explanation
of
the
astonishing
phenomenon
which
the
whole
world
had
been
wondering
over
for
some
time
in
an
hour
the
albatross
had
left
omaha
and
crossed
the
platte
river
whose
valley
is
followed
by
the
pacific
railway
in
its
route
across
the
prairie
things
looked
serious
for
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
it
is
serious
then
this
absurd
project
of
taking
us
to
the
antipodes
and
whether
we
like
it
or
not
exclaimed
the
other
robur
had
better
take
care
i
am
not
the
man
to
stand
that
sort
of
thing
nor
am
i
replied
phil
evans
but
be
calm
uncle
prudent
be
calm
be
calm
and
keep
your
temper
until
it
is
wanted
by
five
they
had
crossed
the
black
mountains
covered
with
pines
and
cedars
and
the
albatross
was
over
the
appropriately
named
bad
lands
of
nebraska
a
chaos
of
hills
of
mountainous
fragments
fallen
on
the
soil
and
broken
in
their
fall
at
a
distance
these
blocks
take
the
most
fantastic
shapes
here
and
there
amid
this
enormous
game
of
knucklebones
there
could
be
traced
the
imaginary
ruins
of
medieval
cities
with
forts
and
dungeons
turrets
and
machicolated
towers
and
in
truth
these
bad
lands
are
an
immense
ossuary
where
lie
bleaching
in
the
sun
myriads
of
fragments
of
pachyderms
chelonians
and
even
some
would
have
us
believe
fossil
men
overwhelmed
by
unknown
cataclysms
ages
and
ages
ago
when
evening
came
the
whole
basin
of
the
platte
river
had
been
crossed
and
the
plain
extended
to
the
extreme
limits
of
the
horizon
which
rose
high
owing
to
the
altitude
of
the
albatross
during
the
night
there
were
no
more
shrill
whistles
of
locomotives
or
deeper
notes
of
the
river
steamers
to
trouble
the
quiet
of
the
starry
firmament
long
bellowing
occasionally
reached
the
aeronef
from
the
herds
of
buffalo
that
roamed
over
the
prairie
in
search
of
water
and
pasturage
and
when
they
ceased
the
trampling
of
the
grass
under
their
feet
produced
a
dull
roaring
similar
to
the
rushing
of
a
flood
and
very
different
from
the
continuous
of
the
screws
then
from
time
to
time
came
the
howl
of
a
wolf
a
fox
a
wild
cat
or
a
coyote
the
canis
latrans
whose
name
is
justified
by
his
sonorous
bark
occasionally
came
penetrating
odors
of
mint
and
sage
and
absinthe
mingled
with
the
more
powerful
fragrance
of
the
conifers
which
rose
floating
through
the
night
air
at
last
came
a
menacing
yell
which
was
not
due
to
the
coyote
it
was
the
shout
of
a
redskin
which
no
tenderfoot
would
confound
with
the
cry
of
a
wild
beast

but
whither
the
next
day
the
of
june
about
five
in
the
morning
phil
evans
left
his
cabin
perhaps
he
would
today
have
a
chance
of
speaking
to
robur
desirous
of
knowing
why
he
had
not
appeared
the
day
before
evans
addressed
himself
to
the
mate
tom
turner
tom
turner
was
an
englishman
of
about
broad
in
the
shoulders
and
short
in
the
legs
a
man
of
iron
with
one
of
those
enormous
characteristic
heads
that
hogarth
rejoiced
in
shall
we
see
robur
asked
phil
evans
i
do
know
said
turner
i
need
not
ask
if
he
has
gone
out
perhaps
he
has
and
when
will
he
come
back
when
he
has
finished
his
cruise
and
tom
went
into
his
cabin
with
this
reply
they
had
to
be
contented
matters
did
not
look
promising
particularly
as
on
reference
to
the
compass
it
appeared
that
the
albatross
was
still
steering
southwest
great
was
the
contrast
between
the
barren
tract
of
the
bad
lands
passed
over
during
the
night
and
the
landscape
then
unrolling
beneath
them
the
aeronef
was
now
more
than
six
hundred
miles
from
omaha
and
over
a
country
which
phil
evans
could
not
recognize
because
he
had
never
been
there
before
a
few
forts
to
keep
the
indians
in
order
crowned
the
bluffs
with
their
geometric
lines
formed
oftener
of
palisades
than
walls
there
were
few
villages
and
few
inhabitants
the
country
differing
widely
from
the
auriferous
lands
of
colorado
many
leagues
to
the
south
in
the
distance
a
long
line
of
mountain
crests
in
great
confusion
as
yet
began
to
appear
they
were
the
rocky
mountains
for
the
first
time
that
morning
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
were
sensible
of
a
certain
lowness
of
temperature
which
was
not
due
to
a
change
in
the
weather
for
the
sun
shone
in
superb
splendor
it
is
because
of
the
albatross
being
higher
in
the
air
said
phil
evans
in
fact
the
barometer
outside
the
central
had
fallen
millimeters
thus
indicating
an
elevation
of
about
feet
above
the
sea
the
aeronef
was
at
this
altitude
owing
to
the
elevation
of
the
ground
an
hour
before
she
had
been
at
a
height
of
feet
and
behind
her
were
mountains
covered
with
perpetual
snow
there
was
nothing
uncle
prudent
and
his
companion
could
remember
which
would
lead
them
to
discover
where
they
were
during
the
night
the
albatross
had
made
several
stretches
north
and
south
at
tremendous
speed
and
that
was
what
had
put
them
out
of
their
reckoning
after
talking
over
several
hypotheses
more
or
less
plausible
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
country
encircled
with
mountains
must
be
the
district
declared
by
an
act
of
congress
in
march
to
be
the
national
park
of
the
united
states
a
strange
region
it
was
it
well
merited
the
name
of
a
park
a
park
with
mountains
for
hills
with
lakes
for
ponds
with
rivers
for
streamlets
and
with
geysers
of
marvelous
power
instead
of
fountains
in
a
few
minutes
the
albatross
glided
across
the
yellowstone
river
leaving
mount
stevenson
on
the
right
and
coasting
the
large
lake
which
bears
the
name
of
the
stream
great
was
the
variety
on
the
banks
of
this
basin
ribbed
as
they
were
with
obsidian
and
tiny
crystals
reflecting
the
sunlight
on
their
myriad
facets
wonderful
was
the
arrangement
of
the
islands
on
its
surface
magnificent
were
the
blue
reflections
of
the
gigantic
mirror
and
around
the
lake
one
of
the
highest
in
the
globe
were
multitudes
of
pelicans
swans
gulls
and
geese
bernicles
and
divers
in
places
the
steep
banks
were
clothed
with
green
trees
pines
and
larches
and
at
the
foot
of
the
escarpments
there
shot
upwards
innumerable
white
fumaroles
the
vapor
escaping
from
the
soil
as
from
an
enormous
reservoir
in
which
the
water
is
kept
in
permanent
ebullition
by
subterranean
fire
the
cook
might
have
seized
the
opportunity
of
securing
an
ample
supply
of
trout
the
only
fish
the
yellowstone
lake
contains
in
myriads
but
the
albatross
kept
on
at
such
a
height
that
there
was
no
chance
of
indulging
in
a
catch
which
assuredly
would
have
been
miraculous
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
the
lake
was
overpassed
and
a
little
farther
on
the
last
was
seen
of
the
geyser
region
which
rivals
the
finest
in
iceland
leaning
over
the
rail
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
watched
the
liquid
columns
which
leaped
up
as
though
to
furnish
the
aeronef
with
a
new
element
there
were
the
fan
with
the
jets
shot
forth
in
rays
the
fortress
which
seemed
to
be
defended
by
waterspouts
the
faithful
friend
with
her
plume
crowned
with
the
rainbows
the
giant
spurting
forth
a
vertical
torrent
twenty
feet
round
and
more
than
two
hundred
feet
high
robur
must
evidently
have
been
familiar
with
this
incomparable
spectacle
unique
in
the
world
for
he
did
not
appear
on
deck
was
it
then
for
the
sole
pleasure
of
his
guests
that
he
had
brought
the
aeronef
above
the
national
domain
if
so
he
came
not
to
receive
their
thanks
he
did
not
even
trouble
himself
during
the
daring
passage
of
the
rocky
mountains
which
the
albatross
approached
at
about
seven
by
increasing
the
speed
of
her
wings
as
a
bird
rising
in
its
flight
the
albatross
would
clear
the
highest
ridges
of
the
chain
and
sink
again
over
oregon
or
utah
but
the
maneuver
was
unnecessary
the
passes
allowed
the
barrier
to
be
crossed
without
ascending
for
the
higher
ridges
there
are
many
of
these
canyons
or
steep
valleys
more
or
less
narrow
through
which
they
could
glide
such
as
bridger
gap
through
which
runs
the
pacific
railway
into
the
mormon
territory
and
others
to
the
north
and
south
of
it
it
was
through
one
of
these
that
the
albatross
headed
after
slackening
speed
so
as
not
to
dash
against
the
walls
of
the
canyon
the
steersman
with
a
sureness
of
hand
rendered
more
effective
by
the
sensitiveness
of
the
rudder
maneuvered
his
craft
as
if
she
were
a
crack
racer
in
a
royal
victoria
match
it
was
really
extraordinary
in
spite
of
all
the
jealousy
of
the
two
enemies
of
lighter
than
air
they
could
not
help
being
surprised
at
the
perfection
of
this
engine
of
aerial
locomotion
in
less
than
two
hours
and
a
half
they
were
through
the
rockies
and
the
albatross
resumed
her
former
speed
of
miles
an
hour
she
was
steering
southwest
so
as
to
cut
across
utah
diagonally
as
she
neared
the
ground
she
had
even
dropped
several
hundred
yards
when
the
sound
of
a
whistle
attracted
the
attention
of
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
it
was
a
train
on
the
pacific
railway
on
the
road
to
salt
lake
city
and
then
in
obedience
to
an
order
secretly
given
the
albatross
dropped
still
lower
so
as
to
chase
the
train
which
was
going
at
full
speed
she
was
immediately
sighted
a
few
heads
showed
themselves
at
the
doors
of
the
cars
then
numerous
passengers
crowded
the
gangways
some
did
not
hesitate
to
climb
on
the
roof
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
flying
machine
cheers
came
floating
up
through
the
air
but
no
robur
appeared
in
answer
to
them
the
albatross
continued
her
descent
slowing
her
suspensory
screws
and
moderating
her
speed
so
as
not
to
leave
the
train
behind
she
flew
about
it
like
an
enormous
beetle
or
a
gigantic
bird
of
prey
she
headed
off
to
the
right
and
left
and
swept
on
in
front
and
hung
behind
and
proudly
displayed
her
flag
with
the
golden
sun
to
which
the
conductor
of
the
train
replied
by
waving
the
stars
and
stripes
in
vain
the
prisoners
in
their
desire
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
endeavored
to
make
themselves
known
to
those
below
in
vain
the
president
of
the
weldon
institute
roared
forth
at
the
top
of
his
voice
i
am
uncle
prudent
of
philadelphia
and
the
secretary
followed
suit
with
i
am
phil
evans
his
colleague
their
shouts
were
lost
in
the
thousand
cheers
with
which
the
passengers
greeted
the
aeronef
three
or
four
of
the
crew
of
the
albatross
had
appeared
on
the
deck
and
one
of
them
like
sailors
when
passing
a
ship
less
speedy
than
their
own
held
out
a
rope
an
ironical
way
of
offering
to
tow
them
and
then
the
albatross
resumed
her
original
speed
and
in
half
an
hour
the
express
was
out
of
sight
about
one
there
appeared
a
vast
disk
which
reflected
the
solar
rays
as
if
it
were
an
immense
mirror
that
ought
to
be
the
mormon
capital
salt
lake
city
said
uncle
prudent
and
so
it
was
and
the
disk
was
the
roof
of
the
tabernacle
where
ten
thousand
saints
can
worship
at
their
ease
this
vast
dome
like
a
convex
mirror
threw
off
the
rays
of
the
sun
in
all
directions
it
vanished
like
a
shadow
and
the
albatross
sped
on
her
way
to
the
southwest
with
a
speed
that
was
not
felt
because
it
surpassed
that
of
the
chasing
wind
soon
she
was
in
nevada
over
the
silver
regions
which
the
sierra
separates
from
the
golden
lands
of
california
we
shall
certainly
reach
san
francisco
before
night
said
phil
evans
and
then
asked
uncle
prudent
it
was
six
precisely
when
the
sierra
nevada
was
crossed
by
the
same
pass
as
that
taken
by
the
railway
only
a
hundred
and
eighty
miles
then
separated
them
from
san
francisco
the
californian
capital
at
the
speed
the
albatross
was
going
she
would
be
over
the
dome
by
eight
at
this
moment
robur
appeared
on
deck
the
colleagues
walked
up
to
him
engineer
robur
said
uncle
prudent
we
are
now
on
the
very
confines
of
america
we
think
the
time
has
come
for
this
joke
to
end
i
never
joke
said
robur
he
raised
his
hand
the
albatross
swiftly
dropped
towards
the
ground
and
at
the
same
time
such
speed
was
given
her
as
to
drive
the
prisoners
into
their
cabin
as
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
uncle
prudent
exclaimed
i
could
strangle
him
we
must
try
to
escape
said
phil
evans
yes
cost
what
it
may
a
long
murmur
greeted
their
ears
it
was
the
beating
of
the
surf
on
the
seashore
it
was
the
pacific
ocean
chapter
xi
the
wide
pacific
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
had
quite
made
up
their
minds
to
escape
if
they
had
not
had
to
deal
with
the
eight
particularly
vigorous
men
who
composed
the
crew
of
the
aeronef
they
might
have
tried
to
succeed
by
main
force
but
as
they
were
only
two
for
frycollin
could
only
be
considered
as
a
quantity
of
no
importance
force
was
not
to
be
thought
of
hence
recourse
must
be
had
to
strategy
as
soon
as
the
albatross
again
took
the
ground
such
was
what
phil
evans
endeavored
to
impress
on
his
irascible
colleague
though
he
was
in
constant
fear
of
prudent
aggravating
matters
by
some
premature
outbreak
in
any
case
the
present
was
not
the
time
to
attempt
anything
of
the
sort
the
aeronef
was
sweeping
along
over
the
north
pacific
on
the
following
morning
that
of
june
the
coast
was
out
of
sight
and
as
the
coast
curves
off
from
vancouver
island
up
to
the
aleutians
belonging
to
that
portion
of
america
ceded
by
russia
to
the
united
states
in
it
was
highly
probable
that
the
albatross
would
cross
it
at
the
end
of
the
curve
if
her
course
remained
unchanged
how
long
the
night
appeared
to
be
to
the
two
friends
how
eager
they
were
to
get
out
of
their
cabins
when
they
came
on
deck
in
the
morning
the
dawn
had
for
some
hours
been
silvering
the
eastern
horizon
they
were
nearing
the
june
solstice
the
longest
day
of
the
year
in
the
northern
hemisphere
when
there
is
hardly
any
night
along
the
sixtieth
parallel
either
from
custom
or
intention
robur
was
in
no
hurry
to
leave
his
when
he
came
out
this
morning
be
contented
himself
with
bowing
to
his
two
guests
as
he
passed
them
in
the
stern
of
the
aeronef
and
now
frycollin
ventured
out
of
his
cabin
his
eyes
red
with
sleeplessness
and
dazed
in
their
look
he
tottered
along
like
a
man
whose
foot
feels
it
is
not
on
solid
ground
his
first
glance
was
at
the
suspensory
screws
which
were
working
with
gratifying
regularity
without
any
signs
of
haste
that
done
the
negro
stumbled
along
to
the
rail
and
grasped
it
with
both
hands
so
as
to
make
sure
of
his
balance
evidently
he
wished
to
view
the
country
over
which
the
albatross
was
flying
at
the
height
of
seven
hundred
feet
or
more
at
first
he
kept
himself
well
back
behind
the
rail
then
he
shook
it
to
make
sure
it
was
firm
then
he
drew
himself
up
then
he
bent
forward
then
he
stretched
out
his
head
it
need
not
be
said
that
while
he
was
executing
these
different
maneuvers
he
kept
his
eyes
shut
at
last
he
opened
them
what
a
shout
and
how
quickly
he
fled
and
how
deeply
his
head
sank
back
into
his
shoulders
at
the
bottom
of
the
abyss
he
had
seen
the
immense
ocean
his
hair
would
have
risen
on
end
if
it
had
not
been
wool
the
sea
the
sea
he
cried
and
frycollin
would
have
fallen
on
the
deck
had
not
the
cook
opened
his
arms
to
receive
him
this
cook
was
a
frenchman
and
probably
a
gascon
his
name
being
francois
tapage
if
he
was
not
a
gascon
he
must
in
his
infancy
have
inhaled
the
breezes
of
the
garonne
how
did
this
francois
tapage
find
himself
in
the
service
of
the
engineer
by
what
chain
of
accidents
had
he
become
one
of
the
crew
of
the
albatross
we
can
hardly
say
but
in
any
case
be
spoke
english
like
a
yankee
eh
stand
up
he
said
lifting
the
negro
by
a
vigorous
clutch
at
the
waist
master
tapage
said
the
poor
fellow
giving
a
despairing
look
at
the
screws
at
your
service
frycollin
did
this
thing
ever
smash
no
but
it
will
end
by
smashing
why
why
because
everything
must
end
and
the
sea
is
beneath
us
if
we
are
to
fall
it
is
better
to
fall
in
the
sea
we
shall
be
drowned
we
shall
be
drowned
but
we
shall
not
be
smashed
to
a
jelly
the
next
moment
frycollin
was
on
all
fours
creeping
to
the
back
of
his
cabin
during
this
day
the
aeronef
was
only
driven
at
moderate
speed
she
seemed
to
skim
the
placid
surface
of
the
sea
which
lay
beneath
uncle
prudent
and
his
companion
remained
in
their
cabin
so
that
they
did
not
meet
with
robur
who
walked
about
smoking
alone
or
talking
to
the
mate
only
half
the
screws
were
working
yet
that
was
enough
to
keep
the
apparatus
afloat
in
the
lower
zones
of
the
atmosphere
the
crew
as
a
change
from
the
ordinary
routine
would
have
endeavored
to
catch
a
few
fish
had
there
been
any
sign
of
them
but
all
that
could
be
seen
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
were
a
few
of
those
whales
which
measure
about
eighty
feet
in
length
these
are
the
most
formidable
cetaceans
in
the
northern
seas
and
whalers
are
very
careful
in
attacking
them
for
their
strength
is
prodigious
however
in
harpooning
one
of
these
whales
either
with
the
ordinary
harpoon
the
fletcher
fuse
or
the
of
which
there
was
an
assortment
on
board
there
would
have
been
danger
to
the
men
of
the
albatross
but
what
was
the
good
of
such
useless
massacre
doubtless
to
show
off
the
powers
of
the
aeronef
to
the
members
of
the
weldon
institute
and
so
robur
gave
orders
for
the
capture
of
one
of
these
monstrous
cetaceans
at
the
shout
of
a
whale
a
whale
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
came
out
of
their
cabin
perhaps
there
was
a
whaler
in
sight
in
that
case
all
they
had
to
do
to
escape
from
their
flying
prison
was
to
jump
into
the
sea
and
chance
being
picked
up
by
the
vessel
the
crew
were
all
on
deck
shall
we
try
sir
asked
tom
turner
yes
said
robur
in
the
the
engineer
and
his
assistant
were
at
their
posts
ready
to
obey
the
orders
signaled
to
them
the
albatross
dropped
towards
the
sea
and
remained
about
fifty
feet
above
it
there
was
no
ship
in
sight
of
that
the
two
colleagues
soon
assured
themselves
nor
was
there
any
land
to
be
seen
to
which
they
could
swim
providing
robur
made
no
attempt
to
recapture
them
several
jets
of
water
from
the
spout
holes
soon
announced
the
presence
of
the
whales
as
they
came
to
the
surface
to
breathe
tom
turner
and
one
of
the
men
were
in
the
bow
within
his
reach
was
one
of
those
of
californian
make
which
are
shot
from
an
arquebus
and
which
are
shaped
as
a
metallic
cylinder
terminated
by
a
cylindrical
shell
armed
with
a
shaft
having
a
barbed
point
robur
was
a
little
farther
aft
and
with
his
right
hand
signaled
to
the
engineers
while
with
his
left
he
directed
the
steersman
he
thus
controlled
the
aeronef
in
every
way
horizontally
and
vertically
and
it
is
almost
impossible
to
conceive
with
what
speed
and
precision
the
albatross
answered
to
his
orders
she
seemed
a
living
being
of
which
he
was
the
soul
a
whale
a
whale
shouted
tom
turner
as
the
back
of
a
cetacean
emerged
from
the
surface
about
four
in
front
of
the
albatross
the
albatross
swept
towards
it
and
when
she
was
within
sixty
feet
of
it
she
stopped
dead
tom
turner
seized
the
arquebus
which
was
resting
against
a
cleat
on
the
rail
he
fired
and
the
projectile
attached
to
a
long
line
entered
the
whale
body
the
shell
filled
with
an
explosive
compound
burst
and
shot
out
a
small
harpoon
with
two
branches
which
fastened
into
the
animal
flesh
look
out
shouted
turner
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
much
against
their
will
became
greatly
interested
in
the
spectacle
the
whale
seriously
wounded
gave
the
sea
such
a
slap
with
his
tail
that
the
water
dashed
up
over
the
bow
of
the
aeronef
then
he
plunged
to
a
great
depth
while
the
line
which
had
been
previously
wetted
in
a
tub
of
water
to
prevent
its
taking
fire
ran
out
like
lightning
when
the
whale
rose
to
the
surface
he
started
off
at
full
speed
in
a
northerly
direction
it
may
be
imagined
with
what
speed
the
albatross
was
towed
in
pursuit
besides
the
propellers
had
been
stopped
the
whale
was
let
go
as
he
would
and
the
ship
followed
him
turner
stood
ready
to
cut
the
line
in
case
a
fresh
plunge
should
render
this
towing
dangerous
for
half
an
hour
and
perhaps
for
a
distance
of
six
miles
the
albatross
was
thus
dragged
along
but
it
was
obvious
that
the
whale
was
tiring
then
at
a
gesture
from
robur
the
assistant
engineers
started
the
propellers
astern
so
as
to
oppose
a
certain
resistance
to
the
whale
who
was
gradually
getting
closer
soon
the
aeronef
was
gliding
about
feet
above
him
his
tail
was
beating
the
waters
with
incredible
violence
and
as
he
turned
over
on
his
back
an
enormous
wave
was
produced
suddenly
the
whale
turned
up
again
so
as
to
take
a
header
as
it
were
and
then
dived
with
such
rapidity
that
turner
had
barely
time
to
cut
the
line
the
aeronef
was
dragged
to
the
very
surface
of
the
water
a
whirlpool
was
formed
where
the
animal
had
disappeared
a
wave
dashed
up
on
to
the
deck
as
if
the
aeronef
were
a
ship
driving
against
wind
and
tide
luckily
with
a
blow
of
the
hatchet
the
mate
severed
the
line
and
the
albatross
freed
from
her
tug
sprang
aloft
six
hundred
feet
under
the
impulse
of
her
ascensional
screws
robur
had
maneuvered
his
ship
without
losing
his
coolness
for
a
moment
a
few
minutes
afterwards
the
whale
returned
to
the
surface
dead
from
every
side
the
birds
flew
down
on
to
the
carcass
and
their
cries
were
enough
to
deafen
a
congress
the
albatross
without
stopping
to
share
in
the
spoil
resumed
her
course
to
the
west
in
the
morning
of
the
of
june
at
about
six
land
was
sighted
on
the
horizon
this
was
the
peninsula
of
alaska
and
the
long
range
of
breakers
of
the
aleutian
islands
the
albatross
glided
over
the
barrier
where
the
fur
seals
swarm
for
the
benefit
of
the
company
an
excellent
business
is
the
capture
of
these
amphibians
which
are
from
six
to
seven
feet
long
russet
in
color
and
weigh
from
three
hundred
to
four
hundred
pounds
there
they
were
in
interminable
files
ranged
in
line
of
battle
and
countable
by
thousands
although
they
did
not
move
at
the
passage
of
the
albatross
it
was
otherwise
with
the
ducks
divers
and
loons
whose
husky
cries
filled
the
air
as
they
disappeared
beneath
the
waves
and
fled
terrified
from
the
aerial
monster
the
twelve
hundred
miles
of
the
behring
sea
between
the
first
of
the
aleutians
and
the
extreme
end
of
kamtschatka
were
traversed
during
the
hours
of
this
day
and
the
following
night
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
found
that
here
was
no
present
chance
of
putting
their
project
of
escape
into
execution
flight
was
not
to
be
thought
of
among
the
deserts
of
eastern
asia
nor
on
the
coast
of
the
sea
of
okhotsk
evidently
the
albatross
was
bound
for
japan
or
china
and
there
although
it
was
not
perhaps
quite
safe
to
trust
themselves
to
the
mercies
of
the
chinese
or
japanese
the
two
friends
had
made
up
their
minds
to
run
if
the
aeronef
stopped
but
would
she
stop
she
was
not
like
a
bird
which
grows
fatigued
by
too
long
a
flight
or
like
a
balloon
which
has
to
descend
for
want
of
gas
she
still
had
food
for
many
weeks
and
her
organs
were
of
marvelous
strength
defying
all
weakness
and
weariness
during
the
of
june
she
swept
over
the
peninsula
of
kamtschatka
and
during
the
day
there
was
a
glimpse
of
petropaulovski
and
the
volcano
of
kloutschew
then
she
rose
again
to
cross
the
sea
of
okhotsk
running
down
by
the
kurile
isles
which
seemed
to
be
a
breakwater
pierced
by
hundreds
of
channels
on
the
in
the
morning
the
albatross
was
over
the
strait
of
la
perouse
between
saghalien
and
northern
japan
and
had
reached
the
mouth
of
the
great
siberian
river
the
amoor
then
there
came
a
fog
so
dense
that
the
aeronef
had
to
rise
above
it
at
the
altitude
she
was
there
was
no
obstacle
to
be
feared
no
elevated
monuments
to
hinder
her
passage
no
mountains
against
which
there
was
risk
of
being
shattered
in
her
flight
the
country
was
only
slightly
varied
but
the
fog
was
very
disagreeable
and
made
everything
on
board
very
damp
all
that
was
necessary
was
to
get
above
this
bed
of
mist
which
was
nearly
thirteen
hundred
feet
thick
and
the
ascensional
screws
being
increased
in
speed
the
albatross
was
soon
clear
of
the
fog
and
in
the
sunny
regions
of
the
sky
under
these
circumstances
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
would
have
found
some
difficulty
in
carrying
out
their
plan
of
escape
even
admitting
that
they
could
leave
the
aeronef
during
the
day
as
robur
passed
them
he
stopped
for
a
moment
and
without
seeming
to
attach
any
importance
to
what
he
said
addressed
them
carelessly
as
follows
gentlemen
a
or
a
steamship
caught
in
a
fog
from
which
it
can
not
escape
is
always
much
delayed
it
must
not
move
unless
it
keeps
its
whistle
or
its
horn
going
it
must
reduce
its
speed
and
any
instant
a
collision
may
be
expected
the
albatross
has
none
of
these
things
to
fear
what
does
fog
matter
to
her
she
can
leave
it
when
she
chooses
the
whole
of
space
is
hers
and
robur
continued
his
stroll
without
waiting
for
an
answer
and
the
puffs
of
his
pipe
were
lost
in
the
sky
uncle
prudent
said
phil
evans
it
seems
that
this
astonishing
albatross
never
has
anything
to
fear
that
we
shall
see
answered
the
president
of
the
weldon
institute
the
fog
lasted
three
days
the
and
of
june
with
regrettable
persistence
an
ascent
had
to
be
made
to
clear
the
japanese
mountain
of
fujiyama
when
the
curtain
of
mist
was
drawn
aside
there
lay
below
them
an
immense
city
with
palaces
villas
gardens
and
parks
even
without
seeing
it
robur
had
recognized
it
by
the
barking
of
the
innumerable
dogs
the
cries
of
the
birds
of
prey
and
above
all
by
the
cadaverous
odor
which
the
bodies
of
its
executed
criminals
gave
off
into
space
the
two
colleagues
were
out
on
the
deck
while
the
engineer
was
taking
his
observations
in
case
he
thought
it
best
to
continue
his
course
through
the
fog
gentlemen
said
he
i
have
no
reason
for
concealing
from
you
that
this
town
is
tokyo
the
capital
of
japan
uncle
prudent
did
not
reply
in
the
presence
of
the
engineer
he
was
almost
choked
as
if
his
lungs
were
short
of
air
this
view
of
tokyo
continued
robur
is
very
curious
curious
as
it
may
be
replied
phil
evans
it
is
not
as
good
as
peking
interrupted
the
engineer
that
is
what
i
think
and
very
shortly
you
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
judging
impossible
to
be
more
agreeable
the
albatross
then
gliding
southeast
had
her
course
changed
four
points
so
as
to
head
to
the
eastward
chapter
xii
through
the
himalayas
during
the
night
the
fog
cleared
off
there
were
symptoms
of
an
approaching
typhoon
a
rapid
fall
of
the
barometer
a
disappearance
of
vapor
large
clouds
of
ellipsoid
form
clinging
to
a
copper
sky
and
on
the
opposite
horizon
long
streaks
of
carmine
on
a
field
with
a
large
sector
quite
clear
in
the
north
then
the
sea
was
smooth
and
calm
and
at
sunset
assumed
a
deep
scarlet
hue
fortunately
the
typhoon
broke
more
to
the
south
and
had
no
other
result
than
to
sweep
away
the
mist
which
had
been
accumulating
during
the
last
three
days
in
an
hour
they
had
traversed
the
hundred
and
miles
of
the
korean
strait
and
while
the
typhoon
was
raging
on
the
coast
of
china
the
albatross
was
over
the
yellow
sea
during
the
and
she
was
over
the
gulf
of
pechelee
and
on
the
she
was
ascending
the
valley
of
the
peiho
on
her
way
to
the
capital
of
the
celestial
empire
leaning
over
the
rail
the
two
colleagues
as
the
engineer
had
told
them
could
see
distinctly
the
immense
city
the
wall
which
divides
it
into
two
parts
the
manchu
town
and
the
chinese
town
the
twelve
suburbs
which
surround
it
the
large
boulevards
which
radiate
from
its
center
the
temples
with
their
green
and
yellow
roofs
bathed
in
the
rising
sun
the
grounds
surrounding
the
houses
of
the
mandarins
then
in
the
middle
of
the
manchu
town
the
eighteen
hundred
acres
of
the
yellow
town
with
its
pagodas
its
imperial
gardens
its
artificial
lakes
its
mountain
of
coal
which
towers
above
the
capital
and
in
the
center
of
the
yellow
town
like
a
square
of
chinese
puzzle
enclosed
in
another
the
red
town
that
is
the
imperial
palace
with
all
the
peaks
of
its
outrageous
architecture
below
the
albatross
the
air
was
filled
with
a
singular
harmony
it
seemed
to
be
a
concert
of
aeolian
harps
in
the
air
were
a
hundred
kites
of
different
forms
made
of
sheets
of
and
having
at
their
upper
end
a
sort
of
bow
of
light
wood
with
a
thin
slip
of
bamboo
beneath
in
the
breath
of
the
wind
these
slips
with
all
their
notes
varied
like
those
of
a
harmonicon
gave
forth
a
most
melancholy
murmuring
it
seemed
as
though
they
were
breathing
musical
oxygen
it
suited
robur
whim
to
run
close
up
to
this
aerial
orchestra
and
the
albatross
slowed
as
she
glided
through
the
sonorous
waves
which
the
kites
gave
off
through
the
atmosphere
but
immediately
an
extraordinary
effect
was
produced
amongst
the
innumerable
population
beatings
of
the
tomtoms
and
sounds
of
other
formidable
instruments
of
the
chinese
orchestra
gun
reports
by
the
thousand
mortars
fired
in
hundreds
all
were
brought
into
play
to
scare
away
the
aeronef
although
the
chinese
astronomers
may
have
recognized
the
aerial
machine
as
the
moving
body
that
had
given
rise
to
such
disputes
it
was
to
the
celestial
million
from
the
humblest
tankader
to
the
mandarin
an
apocalyptical
monster
appearing
in
the
sky
of
buddha
the
crew
of
the
albatross
troubled
themselves
very
little
about
these
demonstrations
but
the
strings
which
held
the
kites
and
were
tied
to
fixed
pegs
in
the
imperial
gardens
were
cut
or
quickly
hauled
in
and
the
kites
were
either
drawn
in
rapidly
sounding
louder
as
they
sank
or
else
fell
like
a
bird
shot
through
both
wings
whose
song
ends
with
its
last
sigh
a
noisy
fanfare
escaped
from
tom
turner
trumpet
and
drowned
the
final
notes
of
the
aerial
concert
it
did
not
interrupt
the
terrestrial
fusillade
at
last
a
shell
exploded
a
few
feet
below
the
albatross
and
then
she
mounted
into
the
inaccessible
regions
of
the
sky
nothing
happened
during
the
few
following
days
of
which
the
prisoners
could
take
advantage
the
aeronef
kept
on
her
course
to
the
southwest
thereby
showing
that
it
was
intended
to
take
her
to
india
twelve
hours
after
leaving
peking
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
great
wall
in
the
neighborhood
of
then
avoiding
the
lung
mountains
they
passed
over
the
valley
of
the
hoangho
and
crossed
the
chinese
border
on
the
tibet
side
tibet
consists
of
high
without
vegetation
with
here
and
there
snowy
peaks
and
barren
ravines
torrents
fed
by
glaciers
depressions
with
glittering
beds
of
salt
lakes
surrounded
by
luxurious
forests
with
icy
winds
sweeping
over
all
the
barometer
indicated
an
altitude
of
thirteen
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
at
that
height
the
temperature
although
it
was
in
the
warmest
months
of
the
northern
hemisphere
was
only
a
little
above
freezing
this
cold
combined
with
the
speed
of
the
albatross
made
the
voyage
somewhat
trying
and
although
the
friends
had
warm
traveling
wraps
they
preferred
to
keep
to
their
cabin
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
to
keep
the
aeronef
in
this
rarefied
atmosphere
the
suspensory
screws
had
to
be
driven
at
extreme
speed
but
they
worked
with
perfect
regularity
and
the
sound
of
their
wings
almost
acted
as
a
lullaby
during
this
day
appearing
from
below
about
the
size
of
a
carrier
pigeon
she
passed
over
garlock
a
town
of
western
tibet
the
capital
of
the
province
of
cari
khorsum
on
the
of
june
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
sighted
an
enormous
barrier
broken
here
and
there
by
several
peaks
lost
in
the
snows
that
bounded
the
horizon
leaning
against
the
so
as
to
keep
their
places
notwithstanding
the
speed
of
the
ship
they
watched
these
colossal
masses
which
seemed
to
be
running
away
from
the
aeronef
the
himalayas
evidently
said
phil
evans
and
probably
robur
is
going
round
their
base
so
as
to
pass
into
india
so
much
the
worse
answered
uncle
prudent
on
that
immense
territory
we
shall
perhaps
be
able
to
unless
he
goes
round
by
burma
to
the
east
or
nepal
to
the
west
anyhow
i
defy
him
to
go
through
them
indeed
said
a
voice
the
next
day
the
of
june
the
albatross
was
in
front
of
the
huge
mass
above
the
province
of
zang
on
the
other
side
of
the
chain
was
the
province
of
nepal
these
ranges
block
the
road
into
india
from
the
north
the
two
northern
ones
between
which
the
aeronef
was
gliding
like
a
ship
between
enormous
reefs
are
the
first
steps
of
the
central
asian
barrier
the
first
was
the
kuen
lung
the
other
the
karakorum
bordering
the
longitudinal
valley
parallel
to
the
himalayas
from
which
the
indus
flows
to
the
west
and
the
brahmapootra
to
the
east

a
superb
orographical
system
more
than
two
hundred

have
been
measured

of

right
was
dhawalagiri
reaching
thousand
eight
hundred
feet
and
relegated
to
second
place
since
the
measurement
of
mount
everest
evidently
robur
did
not
intend
to
go
over
the
top
of
these
peaks
but
probably
he
knew
the
passes
of
the
himalayas
among
others
that
of
ibi
ganim
which
the
brothers
schlagintweit
traversed
in
at
a
height
of
thousand
feet
and
towards
it
he
went
several
hours
of
palpitation
becoming
quite
painful
followed
and
although
the
rarefaction
of
the
air
was
not
such
as
to
necessitate
recourse
being
had
to
the
special
apparatus
for
renewing
oxygen
in
the
cabins
the
cold
was
excessive
robur
stood
in
the
bow
his
sturdy
figure
wrapped
in
a
he
gave
the
orders
while
tom
turner
was
at
the
helm
the
engineer
kept
an
attentive
watch
on
his
batteries
the
acid
in
which
fortunately
ran
no
risk
of
congelation
the
screws
running
at
the
full
strength
of
the
current
gave
forth
a
note
of
intense
shrillness
in
spite
of
the
trifling
density
of
the
air
the
barometer
showed
thousand
feet
in
altitude
magnificent
was
the
grouping
of
the
chaos
of
mountains
everywhere
were
brilliant
white
summits
there
were
no
lakes
but
glaciers
descending
ten
thousand
feet
towards
the
base
there
was
no
herbage
only
a
few
phanerogams
on
the
limit
of
vegetable
life
down
on
the
lower
flanks
of
the
range
were
splendid
forests
of
pines
and
cedars
here
were
none
of
the
gigantic
ferns
and
interminable
parasites
stretching
from
tree
to
tree
as
in
the
thickets
of
the
jungle
there
were
no
animals
no
wild
horses
or
yaks
or
tibetan
bulls
occasionally
a
scared
gazelle
showed
itself
far
down
the
slopes
there
were
no
birds
save
a
couple
of
those
crows
which
can
rise
to
the
utmost
limits
of
the
respirable
air
the
pass
at
last
was
traversed
the
albatross
began
to
descend
coming
from
the
hills
out
of
the
forest
region
there
was
now
beneath
them
an
immense
plain
stretching
far
and
wide
then
robur
stepped
up
to
his
guests
and
in
a
pleasant
voice
remarked
india
gentlemen
chapter
xiii
over
the
caspian
the
engineer
had
no
intention
of
taking
his
ship
over
the
wondrous
lands
of
hindustan
to
cross
the
himalayas
was
to
show
how
admirable
was
the
machine
he
commanded
to
convince
those
who
would
not
be
convinced
was
all
he
wished
to
do
but
if
in
their
hearts
uncle
prudent
and
his
colleague
could
not
help
admiring
so
perfect
an
engine
of
aerial
locomotion
they
allowed
none
of
their
admiration
to
be
visible
all
they
thought
of
was
how
to
escape
they
did
not
even
admire
the
superb
spectacle
that
lay
beneath
them
as
the
albatross
flew
along
the
river
banks
of
the
punjab
at
the
base
of
the
himalayas
there
runs
a
marshy
belt
of
country
the
home
of
malarious
vapors
the
terai
in
which
fever
is
endemic
but
this
offered
no
obstacle
to
the
albatross
or
in
any
way
affected
the
health
of
her
crew
she
kept
on
without
undue
haste
towards
the
angle
where
india
joins
on
to
china
and
turkestan
and
on
the
of
june
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
there
opened
to
view
the
incomparable
valley
of
cashmere
yes
incomparable
is
this
gorge
between
the
major
and
the
minor
himalayas
furrowed
by
the
buttresses
in
which
the
mighty
range
dies
out
in
the
basin
of
the
hydaspes
and
watered
by
the
capricious
windings
of
the
river
which
saw
the
struggle
between
the
armies
of
porus
and
alexander
when
india
and
greece
contended
for
central
asia
the
hydaspes
is
still
there
although
the
two
towns
founded
by
the
macedonian
in
remembrance
of
his
victory
have
long
since
disappeared
during
the
morning
the
aeronef
was
over
serinuggur
which
is
better
known
under
the
name
of
cashmere
uncle
prudent
and
his
companion
beheld
the
superb
city
clustered
along
both
banks
of
the
river
its
wooden
bridges
stretching
across
like
threads
its
villas
and
their
balconies
standing
out
in
bold
outline
its
hills
shaded
by
tall
poplars
its
roofs
grassed
over
and
looking
like
molehills
its
numerous
canals
with
boats
like
and
boatmen
like
ants
its
palaces
temples
kiosks
mosques
and
bungalows
on
the
outskirts
and
its
old
citadel
of
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
like
the
most
important
of
the
forts
of
paris
on
the
slope
of
mont
valerien
that
would
be
venice
said
phil
evans
if
we
were
in
europe
and
if
we
were
in
europe
answered
uncle
prudent
we
should
know
how
to
find
the
way
to
america
the
albatross
did
not
linger
over
the
lake
through
which
the
river
flows
but
continued
her
flight
down
the
valley
of
the
hydaspes
for
half
an
hour
only
did
she
descend
to
within
thirty
feet
of
the
river
and
remained
stationary
then
by
means
of
an
pipe
tom
turner
and
his
men
replenished
their
water
supply
which
was
drawn
up
by
a
pump
worked
by
the
accumulators
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
stood
watching
the
operation
the
same
idea
occurred
to
each
of
them
they
were
only
a
few
feet
from
the
surface
of
the
stream
they
were
both
good
swimmers
a
plunge
would
give
them
their
liberty
and
once
they
had
reached
the
river
how
could
robur
get
them
back
again
for
his
propellers
to
work
he
must
keep
at
least
six
feet
above
the
ground
in
a
moment
all
the
chances
pro
and
con
were
run
over
in
their
heads
in
a
moment
they
were
considered
and
the
prisoners
rushed
to
throw
themselves
overboard
when
several
pairs
of
hands
seized
them
by
the
shoulders
they
had
been
watched
and
flight
was
utterly
impossible
this
time
they
did
not
yield
without
resisting
they
tried
to
throw
off
those
who
held
them
but
these
men
of
the
albatross
were
no
children
gentlemen
said
the
engineer
when
people
have
the
pleasure
of
traveling
with
robur
the
conqueror
as
you
have
so
well
named
him
on
board
his
admirable
albatross
they
do
not
leave
him
in
that
way
i
may
add
you
never
leave
him
phil
evans
drew
away
his
colleague
who
was
about
to
commit
some
act
of
violence
they
retired
to
their
cabin
resolved
to
escape
even
if
it
cost
them
their
lives
immediately
the
albatross
resumed
her
course
to
the
west
during
the
day
at
moderate
speed
she
passed
over
the
territory
of
cabulistan
catching
a
momentary
glimpse
of
its
capital
and
crossed
the
frontier
of
the
kingdom
of
herat
nearly
seven
hundred
miles
from
cashmere
in
these
countries
the
open
road
for
the
russians
to
the
english
possessions
in
india
there
were
seen
many
columns
and
convoys
and
in
a
word
everything
that
constitutes
in
men
and
material
an
army
on
the
march
there
were
heard
also
the
roar
of
the
cannon
and
the
crackling
of
musketry
but
the
engineer
never
meddled
with
the
affairs
of
others
where
his
honor
or
humanity
was
not
concerned
he
passed
above
them
if
herat
as
we
are
told
is
the
key
of
central
asia
it
mattered
little
to
him
if
it
was
kept
in
an
english
or
muscovite
pocket
terrestrial
interests
were
nothing
to
him
who
had
made
the
air
his
domain
besides
the
country
soon
disappeared
in
one
of
those
sandstorms
which
are
so
frequent
in
these
regions
the
wind
called
the
tebbad
bears
along
the
seeds
of
fever
in
the
impalpable
dust
it
raises
in
its
passage
and
many
are
the
caravans
that
perish
in
its
eddies
to
escape
this
dust
which
might
have
interfered
with
the
working
of
the
screws
the
albatross
shot
up
some
six
thousand
feet
into
a
purer
atmosphere
and
thus
vanished
the
persian
frontier
and
the
extensive
plains
the
speed
was
not
excessive
although
there
were
no
rocks
ahead
for
the
mountains
marked
on
the
map
are
of
very
moderate
altitude
but
as
the
ship
approached
the
capital
she
had
to
steer
clear
of
demavend
whose
snowy
peak
rises
some
thousand
feet
and
the
chain
of
elbruz
at
whose
foot
is
built
teheran
as
soon
as
the
day
broke
on
the
of
july
the
peak
of
demavend
appeared
above
the
sandstorm
and
the
albatross
was
steered
so
as
to
pass
over
the
town
which
the
wind
had
wrapped
in
a
mantle
of
dust
however
about
six
her
crew
could
see
the
large
ditches
that
surround
it
and
the
shah
palace
with
its
walls
covered
with
porcelain
tiles
and
its
ornamental
lakes
which
seemed
like
huge
turquoises
of
beautiful
blue
it
was
but
a
hasty
glimpse
the
albatross
now
headed
for
the
north
and
a
few
hours
afterwards
she
was
over
a
little
hill
at
the
northern
angle
of
the
persian
frontier
on
the
shores
of
a
vast
extent
of
water
which
stretched
away
out
of
sight
to
the
north
and
east
the
town
was
ashurada
the
most
southerly
of
the
russian
stations
the
vast
extent
of
water
was
a
sea
it
was
the
caspian
the
eddies
of
sand
had
been
passed
there
was
a
view
of
a
group
of
european
houses
rising
along
a
promontory
with
a
church
tower
in
the
midst
of
them
the
albatross
swooped
down
towards
the
surface
of
the
sea
towards
evening
she
was
running
along
the
coast
which
formerly
belonged
to
turkestan
but
now
belongs
to
russia
and
in
the
morning
of
the
of
july
she
was
about
three
hundred
feet
above
the
caspian
there
was
no
land
in
sight
either
on
the
asiatic
or
european
side
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
a
few
white
sails
were
bellying
in
the
breeze
these
were
native
vessels
recognizable
by
their
peculiar
rig
kesebeys
with
two
masts
kayuks
the
old
with
one
mast
teimils
and
smaller
craft
for
trading
and
fishing
here
and
there
a
few
puffs
of
smoke
rose
up
to
the
albatross
from
the
funnels
of
the
ashurada
steamers
which
the
russians
keep
as
the
police
of
these
turcoman
waters
that
morning
tom
turner
was
talking
to
the
cook
tapage
and
to
a
question
of
his
replied
yes
we
shall
be
about
hours
over
the
caspian
good
said
the
cook
then
we
can
have
some
fishing
just
so
they
were
to
remain
for
hours
over
the
caspian
which
is
some
six
hundred
and
miles
long
and
two
hundred
wide
because
the
speed
of
the
albatross
had
been
much
reduced
and
while
the
fishing
was
going
on
she
would
be
stopped
altogether
the
reply
was
heard
by
phil
evans
who
was
then
in
the
bow
where
frycollin
was
overwhelming
him
with
piteous
pleadings
to
be
put
on
the
ground
without
replying
to
this
preposterous
request
evans
returned
aft
to
uncle
prudent
and
there
taking
care
not
to
be
overheard
he
reported
the
conversation
that
had
taken
place
phil
evans
said
uncle
prudent
i
think
there
can
be
no
mistake
as
to
this
scoundrel
intention
with
regard
to
us
none
said
phil
evans
he
will
only
give
us
our
liberty
when
it
suits
him
and
perhaps
not
at
all
in
that
case
we
must
do
all
we
can
to
get
away
from
the
a
splendid
craft
she
is
i
must
admit
perhaps
so
said
uncle
prudent
but
she
belongs
to
a
scoundrel
who
detains
us
on
board
in
defiance
of
all
right
for
us
and
ours
she
is
a
constant
danger
if
we
do
not
destroy
her
let
us
begin
by
saving
ourselves
answered
phil
evans
we
can
see
about
the
destruction
afterwards
just
so
said
uncle
prudent
and
we
must
avail
ourselves
of
every
chance
that
comes
along
evidently
the
albatross
is
going
to
cross
the
caspian
into
europe
either
by
the
north
into
russia
or
by
the
west
into
the
southern
countries
well
no
matter
where
we
stop
before
we
get
to
the
atlantic
we
shall
be
safe
and
we
ought
to
be
ready
at
any
moment
but
asked
evans
how
are
we
to
get
out
listen
to
me
said
uncle
prudent
it
may
happen
during
the
night
that
the
albatross
may
drop
to
within
a
few
hundred
feet
of
the
ground
now
there
are
on
board
several
ropes
of
that
length
and
with
a
little
pluck
we
might
slip
down
them
yes
said
evans
if
the
case
is
desperate
i
do
mind
nor
i
during
the
night
there
no
one
about
except
the
man
at
the
wheel
and
if
we
can
drop
one
of
the
ropes
forward
without
being
seen
or
heard
good
i
am
glad
to
see
you
are
so
cool
that
means
business
but
just
now
we
are
over
the
caspian
there
are
several
ships
in
sight
the
albatross
is
going
down
to
fish
can
not
we
do
something
now
sh
they
are
watching
us
much
more
than
you
think
said
uncle
prudent
you
saw
that
when
we
tried
to
jump
into
the
hydaspes
and
who
knows
that
they
do
watch
us
at
night
asked
evans
well
we
must
end
this
we
must
finish
with
this
albatross
and
her
master
it
will
be
seen
how
in
the
excitement
of
their
anger
the
colleagues
uncle
prudent
in
particular
were
prepared
to
attempt
the
most
hazardous
things
the
sense
of
their
powerlessness
the
ironical
disdain
with
which
robur
treated
them
the
brutal
remarks
he
indulged
in
all
contributed
towards
intensifying
the
aggravation
which
daily
grew
more
manifest
this
very
day
something
occurred
which
gave
rise
to
another
most
regrettable
altercation
between
robur
and
his
guests
this
was
provoked
by
frycollin
who
finding
himself
above
the
boundless
sea
was
seized
with
another
fit
of
terror
like
a
child
like
the
negro
he
was
he
gave
himself
over
to
groaning
and
protesting
and
crying
and
writhing
in
a
thousand
contortions
and
grimaces
i
want
to
get
out
i
want
to
get
out
i
am
not
a
bird
boohoo
i
do
want
to
fly
i
want
to
get
out
uncle
prudent
as
may
be
imagined
did
not
attempt
to
quiet
him
in
fact
he
encouraged
him
and
particularly
as
the
incessant
howling
seemed
to
have
a
strangely
irritating
effect
on
robur
when
tom
turner
and
his
companions
were
getting
ready
for
fishing
the
engineer
ordered
them
to
shut
up
frycollin
in
his
cabin
but
the
negro
never
ceased
his
jumping
about
and
began
to
kick
at
the
wall
and
yell
with
redoubled
power
it
was
noon
the
albatross
was
only
about
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
above
the
water
a
few
ships
terrified
at
the
apparition
sought
safety
in
flight
as
may
be
guessed
a
sharp
was
kept
on
the
prisoners
whose
temptation
to
escape
could
not
but
be
intensified
even
supposing
they
jumped
overboard
they
would
have
been
picked
up
by
the
boat
as
there
was
nothing
to
do
during
the
fishing
in
which
phil
evans
intended
to
take
part
uncle
prudent
raging
furiously
as
usual
retired
to
his
cabin
the
caspian
sea
is
a
volcanic
depression
into
it
flow
the
waters
of
the
volga
the
ural
the
kour
the
kouma
the
jemba
and
others
without
the
evaporation
which
relieves
it
of
its
overflow
this
basin
with
an
area
of
square
miles
and
a
depth
of
from
sixty
to
four
hundred
feet
would
flood
the
low
marshy
ground
to
its
north
and
east
although
it
is
not
in
communication
with
the
black
sea
or
the
sea
of
aral
being
at
a
much
lower
level
than
they
are
it
contains
an
immense
number
of
fish
such
fish
be
it
understood
as
can
live
in
its
bitter
waters
the
bitterness
being
due
to
the
naphtha
which
pours
in
from
the
springs
on
the
south
the
crew
of
the
albatross
made
no
secret
of
their
delight
at
the
change
in
their
food
the
fishing
would
bring
them
look
out
shouted
turner
as
he
harpooned
a
fish
not
unlike
a
shark
it
was
a
splendid
sturgeon
seven
feet
long
called
by
the
russians
beluga
the
eggs
of
which
mixed
up
with
salt
vinegar
and
white
wine
form
caviar
sturgeons
from
the
river
are
it
may
be
rather
better
than
those
from
the
sea
but
these
were
welcomed
warmly
enough
on
board
the
albatross
but
the
best
catches
were
made
with
the
which
brought
up
at
each
haul
carp
bream
salmon
saltwater
pike
and
a
number
of
sterlets
which
wealthy
gourmets
have
sent
alive
to
astrakhan
moscow
and
petersburg
and
which
now
passed
direct
from
their
natural
element
into
the
cook
kettle
without
any
charge
for
transport
an
hour
work
sufficed
to
fill
up
the
larders
of
the
aeronef
and
she
resumed
her
course
to
the
north
during
the
fishing
frycollin
had
continued
shouting
and
kicking
at
his
cabin
wall
and
making
a
tremendous
noise
that
wretched
nigger
will
not
be
quiet
then
said
robur
almost
out
of
patience
it
seems
to
me
sir
he
has
a
right
to
complain
said
phil
evans
yes
and
i
have
a
right
to
look
after
my
ears
replied
robur
engineer
robur
said
uncle
prudent
who
had
just
appeared
on
deck
president
of
the
weldon
institute
they
had
stepped
up
to
one
another
and
were
looking
into
the
whites
of
each
other
eyes
then
robur
shrugged
his
shoulders
put
him
at
the
end
of
a
line
he
said
turner
saw
his
meaning
at
once
frycollin
was
dragged
out
of
his
cabin
loud
were
his
cries
when
the
mate
and
one
of
the
men
seized
him
and
tied
him
into
a
tub
which
they
hitched
on
to
a
rope
one
of
those
very
ropes
in
fact
that
uncle
prudent
had
intended
to
use
as
we
know
the
negro
at
first
thought
he
was
going
to
be
hanged
not
he
was
only
going
to
be
towed
the
rope
was
paid
out
for
a
hundred
feet
and
frycollin
found
himself
hanging
in
space
he
could
then
shout
at
his
ease
but
fright
contracted
his
larynx
and
he
was
mute
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
endeavored
to
prevent
this
performance
they
were
thrust
aside
it
is
scandalous
it
is
cowardly
said
uncle
prudent
quite
beside
himself
with
rage
indeed
said
robur
it
is
an
abuse
of
power
against
which
i
protest
protest
away
i
will
be
avenged
mr
robur
avenge
when
you
like
mr
prudent
i
will
have
my
revenge
on
you
and
yours
the
crew
began
to
close
up
with
anything
but
peaceful
intentions
robur
motioned
them
away
yes
on
you
and
yours
said
uncle
prudent
whom
his
colleague
in
vain
tried
to
keep
quiet
whenever
you
please
said
the
engineer
and
in
every
possible
way
that
is
enough
now
said
robur
in
a
threatening
tone
there
are
other
ropes
on
board
and
if
you
do
be
quiet
i
treat
you
as
i
have
done
your
servant
uncle
prudent
was
silent
not
because
he
was
afraid
but
because
his
wrath
had
nearly
choked
him
and
phil
evans
led
him
off
to
his
cabin
during
the
last
hour
the
air
had
been
strangely
troubled
the
symptoms
could
not
be
mistaken
a
storm
was
threatening
the
electric
saturation
of
the
atmosphere
had
become
so
great
that
about
two
robur
witnessed
a
phenomenon
that
was
new
to
him
in
the
north
whence
the
storm
was
traveling
were
spirals
of
vapor
due
to
the
difference
in
the
electric
charges
of
the
various
beds
of
cloud
the
reflections
of
these
bands
came
running
along
the
waves
in
myriads
of
lights
growing
in
intensity
as
the
sky
darkened
the
albatross
and
the
storm
were
sure
to
meet
for
they
were
exactly
in
front
of
each
other
and
frycollin
well
frycollin
was
being
towed
and
towed
is
exactly
the
word
for
the
rope
made
such
an
angle
with
the
aeronef
now
going
at
over
sixty
knots
an
hour
that
the
tub
was
a
long
way
behind
her
the
crew
were
busy
in
preparing
for
the
storm
for
the
albatross
would
either
have
to
rise
above
it
or
drive
through
its
lowest
layers
she
was
about
three
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
when
a
clap
of
thunder
was
heard
suddenly
the
squall
struck
her
in
a
few
seconds
the
fiery
clouds
swept
on
around
her
phil
evans
went
to
intercede
for
frycollin
and
asked
for
him
to
be
taken
on
board
again
but
robur
had
already
given
orders
to
that
effect
and
the
rope
was
being
hauled
in
when
suddenly
there
took
place
an
inexplicable
slackening
in
the
speed
of
the
screws
the
engineer
rushed
to
the
central
power
more
power
he
shouted
we
must
rise
quickly
and
get
over
the
storm
impossible
sir
what
is
the
matter
the
currents
are
troubled
they
are
intermittent
and
in
fact
the
albatross
was
falling
fast
as
with
the
telegraph
wires
on
land
during
a
storm
so
was
it
with
the
accumulators
of
the
aeronef
but
what
is
only
an
inconvenience
in
the
case
of
messages
was
here
a
terrible
danger
let
her
down
then
said
robur
and
get
out
of
the
electric
zone
keep
cool
my
lads
he
stepped
on
to
his
and
his
crew
went
to
their
stations
although
the
albatross
had
sunk
several
hundred
feet
she
was
still
in
the
thick
of
the
cloud
and
the
flashes
played
across
her
as
if
they
were
fireworks
it
seemed
as
though
she
was
struck
the
screws
ran
more
and
more
slowly
and
what
began
as
a
gentle
descent
threatened
to
become
a
collapse
in
less
than
a
minute
it
was
evident
they
would
get
down
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
once
they
were
immersed
no
power
could
drag
them
from
the
abyss
suddenly
the
electric
cloud
appeared
above
them
the
albatross
was
only
sixty
feet
from
the
crest
of
the
waves
in
two
or
three
seconds
the
deck
would
be
under
water
but
robur
seizing
the
propitious
moment
rushed
to
the
central
house
and
seized
the
levers
he
turned
on
the
currents
from
the
piles
no
longer
neutralized
by
the
electric
tension
of
the
surrounding
atmosphere
in
a
moment
the
screws
had
regained
their
normal
speed
and
checked
the
descent
and
the
albatross
remained
at
her
slight
elevation
while
her
propellers
drove
her
swiftly
out
of
reach
of
the
storm
frycollin
of
course
had
a
bath
though
only
for
a
few
seconds
when
he
was
dragged
on
deck
he
was
as
wet
as
if
he
had
been
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
as
may
be
imagined
he
cried
no
more
in
the
morning
of
the
of
july
the
albatross
had
passed
over
the
northern
shore
of
the
caspian
chapter
xiv
the
aeronef
at
full
speed
if
ever
prudent
and
evans
despaired
on
escaping
from
the
albatross
it
was
during
the
two
days
that
followed
it
may
be
that
robur
considered
it
more
difficult
to
keep
a
watch
on
his
prisoners
while
he
was
crossing
europe
and
he
knew
that
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
get
away
but
any
attempt
to
have
done
so
would
have
been
simply
committing
suicide
to
jump
from
an
express
going
sixty
miles
an
hour
is
to
risk
your
life
but
to
jump
from
a
machine
going
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
an
hour
would
be
to
seek
your
death
and
it
was
at
this
speed
the
greatest
that
could
be
given
to
her
that
the
albatross
tore
along
her
speed
exceeded
that
of
the
swallow
which
is
one
hundred
and
twelve
miles
an
hour
at
first
the
wind
was
in
the
northeast
and
the
albatross
had
it
fair
her
general
course
being
a
westerly
one
but
the
wind
began
to
drop
and
it
soon
became
impossible
for
the
colleagues
to
remain
on
the
deck
without
having
their
breath
taken
away
by
the
rapidity
of
the
flight
and
on
one
occasion
they
would
have
been
blown
overboard
if
they
had
not
been
dashed
up
against
the
by
the
pressure
of
the
wind
luckily
the
steersman
saw
them
through
the
windows
of
his
cage
and
by
the
electric
bell
gave
the
alarm
to
the
men
in
the
four
of
them
came
aft
creeping
along
the
deck
those
who
have
been
at
sea
beating
to
windward
in
half
a
gale
of
wind
will
understand
what
the
pressure
was
like
but
here
it
was
the
albatross
that
by
her
incomparable
speed
made
her
own
wind
to
allow
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
to
get
back
to
their
cabin
the
speed
had
to
be
reduced
inside
the
the
albatross
bore
with
her
a
perfectly
breathable
atmosphere
to
stand
such
driving
the
strength
of
the
apparatus
must
have
been
prodigious
the
propellers
spun
round
so
swiftly
that
they
seemed
immovable
and
it
was
with
irresistible
power
that
they
screwed
themselves
through
the
air
the
last
town
that
had
been
noticed
was
astrakhan
situated
at
the
north
end
of
the
caspian
sea
the
star
of
the
desert
it
must
have
been
a
poet
who
so
called
it
has
now
sunk
from
the
first
rank
to
the
fifth
or
sixth
a
momentary
glance
was
afforded
at
its
old
walls
with
their
useless
battlements
the
ancient
towers
in
the
center
of
the
city
the
mosques
and
modern
churches
the
cathedral
with
its
five
domes
gilded
and
dotted
with
stars
as
if
it
were
a
piece
of
the
sky
as
they
rose
from
the
bank
of
the
volga
which
here
as
it
joins
the
sea
is
over
a
mile
in
width
thenceforward
the
flight
of
the
albatross
became
quite
a
race
through
the
heights
of
the
sky
as
if
she
had
been
harnessed
to
one
of
those
fabulous
hippogriffs
which
cleared
a
league
at
every
sweep
of
the
wing
at
ten
in
the
morning
of
the
of
july
the
aeronef
heading
northwest
followed
for
a
little
the
valley
of
the
volga
the
steppes
of
the
don
and
the
ural
stretched
away
on
each
side
of
the
river
even
if
it
had
been
possible
to
get
a
glimpse
of
these
vast
territories
there
would
have
been
no
time
to
count
the
towns
and
villages
in
the
evening
the
aeronef
passed
over
moscow
without
saluting
the
flag
on
the
kremlin
in
ten
hours
she
had
covered
the
twelve
hundred
miles
which
separate
astrakhan
from
the
ancient
capital
of
all
the
russias
from
moscow
to
petersburg
the
railway
line
measures
about
seven
hundred
and
fifty
miles
this
was
but
a
journey
and
the
albatross
as
punctual
as
the
mail
reached
petersburg
and
the
banks
of
the
neva
at
two
in
the
morning
then
came
the
gulf
of
finland
the
archipelago
of
abo
the
baltic
sweden
in
the
latitude
of
stockholm
and
norway
in
the
latitude
of
christiania
ten
hours
only
for
these
twelve
hundred
miles
verily
it
might
be
thought
that
no
human
power
would
henceforth
be
able
to
check
the
speed
of
the
albatross
and
as
if
the
resultant
of
her
force
of
projection
and
the
attraction
of
the
earth
would
maintain
her
in
an
unvarying
trajectory
round
the
globe
but
she
did
stop
nevertheless
and
that
was
over
the
famous
fall
of
the
rjukanfos
in
norway
gousta
whose
summit
dominates
this
wonderful
region
of
tellermarken
stood
in
the
west
like
a
gigantic
barrier
apparently
impassable
and
when
the
albatross
resumed
her
journey
at
full
speed
her
head
had
been
turned
to
the
south
and
during
this
extraordinary
flight
what
was
frycollin
doing
he
remained
silent
in
a
corner
of
his
cabin
sleeping
as
well
as
he
could
except
at
meal
times
tapage
then
favored
him
with
his
company
and
amused
himself
at
his
expense
eh
eh
my
boy
said
he
so
you
are
not
crying
any
more
perhaps
it
hurt
you
too
much
that
two
hours
hanging
cured
you
of
it
at
our
present
rate
what
a
splendid
you
might
have
for
your
rheumatics
it
seems
to
me
we
shall
soon
go
to
pieces
perhaps
so
but
we
shall
go
so
fast
we
sha
have
time
to
fall
that
is
some
comfort
do
you
think
so
i
do
to
tell
the
truth
and
not
to
exaggerate
like
tapage
it
was
only
reasonable
that
owing
to
the
excessive
speed
the
work
of
the
suspensory
screws
should
be
somewhat
lessened
the
albatross
glided
on
its
bed
of
air
like
a
congreve
rocket
and
shall
we
last
long
like
that
asked
frycollin
long
oh
no
only
as
long
as
we
live
oh
said
the
negro
beginning
his
lamentations
take
care
fry
take
care
for
as
they
say
in
my
country
the
master
may
send
you
to
the
seesaw
and
frycollin
gulped
down
his
sobs
as
he
gulped
down
the
meat
which
in
double
doses
he
was
hastily
swallowing
meanwhile
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
who
were
not
men
to
waste
time
in
wrangling
when
nothing
could
come
of
it
agreed
upon
doing
something
it
was
evident
that
escape
was
not
to
be
thought
of
but
if
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
again
set
foot
on
the
terrestrial
globe
could
they
not
make
known
to
its
inhabitants
what
had
become
of
them
since
their
disappearance
and
tell
them
by
whom
they
had
been
carried
off
and
provoke
how
was
not
very
clear
some
audacious
attempt
on
the
part
of
their
friends
to
rescue
them
from
robur
communicate
but
how
should
they
follow
the
example
of
sailors
in
distress
and
enclose
in
a
bottle
a
document
giving
the
place
of
shipwreck
and
throw
it
into
the
sea
but
here
the
sea
was
the
atmosphere
the
bottle
would
not
swim
and
if
it
did
not
fall
on
somebody
and
crack
his
skull
it
might
never
be
found
the
colleagues
were
about
to
sacrifice
one
of
the
bottles
on
board
when
an
idea
occurred
to
uncle
prudent
he
took
snuff
as
we
know
and
we
may
pardon
this
fault
in
an
american
who
might
do
worse
and
as
a
he
possessed
a
which
was
now
empty
this
box
was
made
of
aluminum
if
it
was
thrown
overboard
any
honest
citizen
that
found
it
would
pick
it
up
and
being
an
honest
citizen
he
would
take
it
to
the
and
there
they
would
open
it
and
discover
from
the
document
what
had
become
of
the
two
victims
of
robur
the
conqueror
and
this
is
what
was
done
the
note
was
short
but
it
told
all
and
it
gave
the
address
of
the
weldon
institute
with
a
request
that
it
might
be
forwarded
then
uncle
prudent
folded
up
the
note
shut
it
in
the
box
bound
the
box
round
with
a
piece
of
worsted
so
as
to
keep
it
from
opening
it
as
it
fell
and
then
all
that
had
to
be
done
was
to
wait
for
a
favorable
opportunity
during
this
marvelous
flight
over
europe
it
was
not
an
easy
thing
to
leave
the
cabin
and
creep
along
the
deck
at
the
risk
of
being
suddenly
and
secretly
blown
away
and
it
would
not
do
for
the
to
fall
into
the
sea
or
a
gulf
or
a
lake
or
a
watercourse
for
it
would
then
perhaps
be
lost
at
the
same
time
it
was
not
impossible
that
the
colleagues
might
in
this
way
get
into
communication
with
the
habitable
globe
it
was
then
growing
daylight
and
it
seemed
as
though
it
would
be
better
to
wait
for
the
night
and
take
advantage
of
a
slackening
speed
or
a
halt
to
go
out
on
deck
and
drop
the
precious
into
some
town
when
all
these
points
had
been
thought
over
and
settled
the
prisoners
found
they
could
not
put
their
plan
into
execution
on
that
day
at
all
events
for
the
albatross
after
leaving
gousta
had
kept
her
southerly
course
which
took
her
over
the
north
sea
much
to
the
consternation
of
the
thousands
of
coasting
craft
engaged
in
the
english
dutch
french
and
belgian
trade
unless
the
fell
on
the
deck
of
one
of
these
vessels
there
was
every
chance
of
its
going
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
were
obliged
to
wait
for
a
better
opportunity
and
as
we
shall
immediately
see
an
excellent
chance
was
soon
to
be
offered
them
at
ten
that
evening
the
albatross
reached
the
french
coast
near
dunkirk
the
night
was
rather
dark
for
a
moment
they
could
see
the
lighthouse
at
grisnez
cross
its
electric
beam
with
the
lights
from
dover
on
the
other
side
of
the
strait
then
the
albatross
flew
over
the
french
territory
at
a
mean
height
of
three
thousand
feet
there
was
no
diminution
in
her
speed
she
shot
like
a
rocket
over
the
towns
and
villages
so
numerous
in
northern
france
she
was
flying
straight
on
to
paris
and
after
dunkirk
came
doullens
amiens
creil
saint
denis
she
never
left
the
line
and
about
midnight
she
was
over
the
city
of
light
which
merits
its
name
even
when
its
inhabitants
are
asleep
or
ought
to
be
by
what
strange
whim
was
it
that
she
was
stopped
over
the
city
of
paris
we
do
not
know
but
down
she
came
till
she
was
within
a
few
hundred
feet
of
the
ground
robur
then
came
out
of
his
cabin
and
the
crew
came
on
to
the
deck
to
breathe
the
ambient
air
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
took
care
not
to
miss
such
an
excellent
opportunity
they
left
their
and
walked
off
away
from
the
others
so
as
to
be
ready
at
the
propitious
moment
it
was
important
their
action
should
not
be
seen
the
albatross
like
a
huge
coleopter
glided
gently
over
the
mighty
city
she
took
the
line
of
the
boulevards
then
brilliantly
lighted
by
the
edison
lamps
up
to
her
there
floated
the
rumble
of
the
vehicles
as
they
drove
along
the
streets
and
the
roll
of
the
trains
on
the
numerous
railways
that
converge
into
paris
then
she
glided
over
the
highest
monuments
as
if
she
was
going
to
knock
the
ball
off
the
pantheon
or
the
cross
off
the
invalides
she
hovered
over
the
two
minarets
of
the
trocadero
and
the
metal
tower
of
the
champ
de
mars
where
the
enormous
reflector
was
inundating
the
whole
capital
with
its
electric
rays
this
aerial
promenade
this
nocturnal
loitering
lasted
for
about
an
hour
it
was
a
halt
for
breath
before
the
voyage
was
resumed
and
probably
robur
wished
to
give
the
parisians
the
sight
of
a
meteor
quite
unforeseen
by
their
astronomers
the
lamps
of
the
albatross
were
turned
on
two
brilliant
sheaves
of
light
shot
down
and
moved
along
over
the
squares
the
gardens
the
palaces
the
sixty
thousand
houses
and
swept
the
space
from
one
horizon
to
the
other
assuredly
the
albatross
was
seen
this
time
and
not
only
well
seen
but
heard
for
tom
turner
brought
out
his
trumpet
and
blew
a
rousing
tarantaratara
at
this
moment
uncle
prudent
leant
over
the
rail
opened
his
hand
and
let
his
fall
immediately
the
albatross
shot
upwards
and
past
her
higher
still
there
mounted
the
noisy
cheering
of
the
crowd
then
thick
on
the
boulevards
a
hurrah
of
stupefaction
to
greet
the
imaginary
meteor
the
lamps
of
the
aeronef
were
turned
off
and
the
darkness
and
the
silence
closed
in
around
as
the
voyage
was
resumed
at
the
rate
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
an
hour
this
was
all
that
was
to
be
seen
of
the
french
capital
at
four
in
the
morning
the
albatross
had
crossed
the
whole
country
obliquely
and
so
as
to
lose
no
time
in
traversing
the
alps
or
the
pyrenees
she
flew
over
the
face
of
provence
to
the
cape
of
antibes
at
nine
next
morning
the
san
pietrini
assembled
on
the
terrace
of
peter
at
rome
were
astounded
to
see
her
pass
over
the
eternal
city
two
hours
afterwards
she
crossed
the
bay
of
naples
and
hovered
for
an
instant
over
the
fuliginous
wreaths
of
vesuvius
then
after
cutting
obliquely
across
the
mediterranean
in
the
early
hours
of
the
afternoon
she
was
signaled
by
the
at
la
goulette
on
the
tunisian
coast
after
america
asia
after
asia
europe
more
than
eighteen
thousand
miles
had
this
wonderful
machine
accomplished
in
less
than
days
and
now
she
was
off
over
the
known
and
unknown
regions
of
africa
it
may
be
interesting
to
know
what
had
happened
to
the
famous
after
its
fall
it
had
fallen
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
opposite
no
when
the
street
was
deserted
in
the
morning
it
was
picked
up
by
an
honest
sweeper
who
took
it
to
the
prefecture
of
police
there
it
was
at
first
supposed
to
be
an
infernal
machine
and
it
was
untied
examined
and
opened
with
care
suddenly
a
sort
of
explosion
took
place
it
was
a
terrific
sneeze
on
the
part
of
the
inspector
the
document
was
then
extracted
from
the
and
to
the
general
surprise
read
as
follows
messrs
prudent
and
evans
president
and

of

philadelphia
have
been
carried
off
in
the

albatross
belonging
to

the
engineer
please
inform
our
friends
and
acquaintances
and
thus
was
the
strange
phenomenon
at
last
explained
to
the
people
of
the
two
worlds
thus
was
peace
given
to
the
scientists
of
the
numerous
observatories

the
surface
of

terrestrial
globe
chapter
xv
a
skirmish
in
dahomey
at
this
point
in
the
circumnavigatory
voyage
of
the
albatross
it
is
only
natural
that
some
such
questions
as
the
following
should
be
asked
who
was
this
robur
of
whom
up
to
the
present
we
know
nothing
but
the
name
did
he
pass
his
life
in
the
air
did
his
aeronef
never
rest
had
he
not
some
retreat
in
some
inaccessible
spot
in
which
if
he
had
need
of
repose
or
revictualing
he
could
betake
himself
it
would
be
very
strange
if
it
were
not
so
the
most
powerful
flyers
have
always
an
eyrie
or
nest
somewhere
and
what
was
the
engineer
going
to
do
with
his
prisoners
was
he
going
to
keep
them
in
his
power
and
condemn
them
to
perpetual
aviation
or
was
he
going
to
take
them
on
a
trip
over
africa
south
america
australasia
the
indian
ocean
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
to
convince
them
against
their
will
and
then
dismiss
them
with
and
now
gentlemen
i
hope
you
will
believe
a
little
more
in
heavier
than
air
to
these
questions
it
is
now
impossible
to
reply
they
are
the
secrets
of
the
future
perhaps
the
answers
will
be
revealed
anyhow
the
robur
was
not
seeking
his
nest
on
the
northern
frontier
of
africa
by
the
end
of
the
day
he
had
traversed
tunis
from
cape
bon
to
cape
carthage
sometimes
hovering
and
sometimes
darting
along
at
top
speed
soon
he
reached
the
interior
and
flew
down
the
beautiful
valley
of
medjeida
above
its
yellow
stream
hidden
under
its
luxuriant
bushes
of
cactus
and
oleander
and
scared
away
the
hundreds
of
parrots
that
perch
on
the
telegraph
wires
and
seem
to
wait
for
the
messages
to
pass
to
bear
them
away
beneath
their
wings
two
hours
after
sunset
the
helm
was
put
up
and
the
albatross
bore
off
to
the
southeast
and
on
the
morrow
after
clearing
the
tell
mountains
she
saw
the
rising
of
the
morning
star
over
the
sands
of
the
sahara
on
the
of
july
there
was
seen
from
the
aeronef
the
little
village
of
geryville
founded
like
laghouat
on
the
frontier
of
the
desert
to
facilitate
the
future
conquest
of
kabylia
next
not
without
difficulty
the
peaks
of
stillero
were
passed
against
a
somewhat
boisterous
wind
then
the
desert
was
crossed
sometimes
leisurely
over
the
ksars
or
green
oases
sometimes
at
terrific
speed
that
far
outstripped
the
flight
of
the
vultures
often
the
crew
had
to
fire
into
the
flocks
of
these
birds
which
a
dozen
or
so
at
a
time
fearlessly
hurled
them
selves
on
to
the
aeronef
to
the
extreme
terror
of
frycollin
but
if
the
vultures
could
only
reply
with
cries
and
blows
of
beaks
and
talons
the
natives
in
no
way
less
savage
were
not
sparing
of
their
particularly
when
crossing
the
mountain
of
sel
whose
green
and
violet
slope
bore
its
cape
of
white
then
the
albatross
was
at
last
over
the
grand
sahara
and
at
once
she
rose
into
the
higher
zones
so
as
to
escape
from
a
simoom
which
was
sweeping
a
wave
of
ruddy
sand
along
the
surface
of
the
ground
like
a
bore
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
then
the
desolate
tablelands
of
chetka
scattered
their
ballast
in
blackish
waves
up
to
the
fresh
and
verdant
valley
of
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
the
variety
of
the
territories
which
could
be
seen
at
one
view
to
the
green
hills
covered
with
trees
and
shrubs
there
succeeded
long
gray
undulations
draped
like
the
folds
of
an
arab
burnous
and
broken
in
picturesque
masses
in
the
distance
could
be
seen
the
wadys
with
their
torrential
waters
their
forests
of
and
blocks
of
small
houses
grouped
on
a
hill
around
a
mosque
among
them
metlili
where
there
vegetates
a
religious
chief
the
grand
marabout
sidi
chick
before
night
several
hundred
miles
had
been
accomplished
above
a
flattish
country
ridged
occasionally
with
large
sandhills
if
the
albatross
had
halted
she
would
have
come
to
the
earth
in
the
depths
of
the
wargla
oasis
hidden
beneath
an
immense
forest
of
the
town
was
clearly
enough
displayed
with
its
three
distinct
quarters
the
ancient
palace
of
the
sultan
a
kind
of
fortified
kasbah
houses
of
brick
which
had
been
left
to
the
sun
to
bake
and
artesian
wells
dug
in
the
valley
where
the
aeronef
could
have
renewed
her
water
supply
but
thanks
to
her
extraordinary
speed
the
waters
of
the
hydaspes
taken
in
the
vale
of
cashmere
still
filled
her
tanks
in
the
center
of
the
african
desert
was
the
albatross
seen
by
the
arabs
the
mozabites
and
the
negroes
who
share
amongst
them
the
town
of
wargla
certainly
for
she
was
saluted
with
many
hundred
gunshot
and
the
bullets
fell
back
before
they
reached
her
then
came
the
night
that
silent
night
in
the
desert
of
which
felicien
david
has
so
poetically
told
us
the
secrets
during
the
following
hours
the
course
lay
southwesterly
cutting
across
the
routes
of
el
golea
one
of
which
was
explored
in
by
the
intrepid
duveyrier
the
darkness
was
profound
nothing
could
be
seen
of
the
railway
constructing
on
the
plans
of
duponchel
a
long
ribbon
of
iron
destined
to
bind
together
algiers
and
timbuktu
by
way
of
laghouat
and
gardaia
and
destined
eventually
to
run
down
into
the
gulf
of
guinea
then
the
albatross
entered
the
equatorial
region
below
the
tropic
of
cancer
six
hundred
miles
from
the
northern
frontier
of
the
sahara
she
crossed
the
route
on
which
major
laing
met
his
death
in
and
crossed
the
road
of
the
caravans
from
morocco
to
the
sudan
and
that
part
of
the
desert
swept
by
the
tuaregs
where
could
be
heard
what
is
called
the
song
of
the
sand
a
soft
and
plaintive
murmur
that
seems
to
escape
from
the
ground
only
one
thing
happened
a
cloud
of
locusts
came
flying
along
and
there
fell
such
a
cargo
of
them
on
board
as
to
threaten
to
sink
the
ship
but
all
hands
set
to
work
to
clear
the
deck
and
the
locusts
were
thrown
over
except
a
few
hundred
kept
by
tapage
for
his
larder
and
he
served
them
up
in
so
succulent
a
fashion
that
frycollin
forgot
for
the
moment
his
perpetual
trances
and
said
these
are
as
good
as
prawns
the
aeronef
was
then
eleven
hundred
miles
from
the
wargla
oasis
and
almost
on
the
northern
frontier
of
the
sudan
about
two
in
the
afternoon
a
city
appeared
in
the
bend
of
a
large
river
the
river
was
the
niger
the
city
was
timbuktu
if
up
to
then
this
african
mecca
had
only
been
visited
by

travelers

ancient

on
that
day
by
a
most
singular
chance
the
two
americans
could
boast
of
having
seen
heard
and
smelt
it
on
their
return
to
america
if
they
ever
got
back
there
of
having
seen
it
because
their
view
included
the
whole
triangle
of
three
or
four
miles
in
circumference
of
having
heard
it
because
the
day
was
one
of
some
rejoicing
and
the
noise
was
terrible
of
having
smelt
it
because
the
olfactory
nerve
could
not
but
be
very
disagreeably
affected
by
the
odors
of
the
square
where
the
meatmarket
stands
close
to
the
palace
of
the
ancient
somai
kings
the
engineer
had
no
notion
of
allowing
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
to
be
ignorant
that
they
had
the
honor
of
contemplating

tone

then
he
continued
timbuktu
is
an
important
city
of

twelve
to

art
perhaps
you
would
like
to
stay
there
for
a
day
or
two
such
a
proposal
could
only
have
been
made
ironically
but
continued
he
it
would
be
dangerous
among
the
negroes
berbers
and
foullanes
who
occupy
it
particularly
as
our
arrival
in
an
aeronef
might
prejudice
them
against
you
sir
said
phil
evans
in
the
same
tone
for
the
pleasure
of
leaving
you
we
would
willingly
risk
an
unpleasant
reception
from
the
natives
prison
for
prison
we
would
rather
be
in
timbuktu
than
on
the
albatross
that
is
a
matter
of
taste
answered
the
engineer
anyhow
i
shall
not
try
the
adventure
for
i
am
responsible
for
the
safety
of
the
guests
who
do
me
the
honor
to
travel
with
me
and
so
said
uncle
prudent
explosively
you
are
not
content
with
being
our
jailer
but
you
insult
us
oh
a
little
irony
that
is
all
are
there
any
weapons
on
board
oh
quite
an
arsenal
two
revolvers
will
do
if
i
hold
one
and
you
the
other
a
duel
exclaimed
robur
a
duel
which
would
perhaps
cause
the
death
of
one
of
us
which
certainly
would
cause
it
well
no
president
of
the
weldon
institute
i
very
much
prefer
keeping
you
alive
to
be
sure
of
living
yourself
that
is
wise
wise
or
not
it
suits
me
you
are
at
liberty
to
think
as
you
like
and
to
complain
to
those
who
have
the
power
to
help
you
if
you
can
and
that
we
have
done
mr
robur
indeed
was
it
so
difficult
when
we
were
crossing
the
inhabited
part
of
europe
to
drop
a
letter
overboard
did
you
do
that
said
robur
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
and
if
we
have
done
it
if
you
have
done
it
you
deserve
what
sir
to
follow
your
letter
overboard
throw
us
over
then
we
did
do
it
robur
stepped
towards
them
at
a
gesture
from
him
tom
turner
and
some
of
the
crew
ran
up
the
engineer
was
seriously
tempted
to
put
his
threat
into
execution
and
fearful
perhaps
of
yielding
to
it
he
precipitately
rushed
into
his
cabin
good
exclaimed
phil
evans
and
what
he
will
dare
not
do
said
uncle
prudent
i
will
do
yes
i
will
do
at
the
moment
the
population
of
timbuktu
were
crowding
onto
the
squares
and
roads
and
the
terraces
built
like
amphitheaters
in
the
rich
quarters
of
sankere
and
sarahama
as
in
the
miserable
huts
at
raguidi
the
priests
from
the
minarets
were
thundering
their
loudest
maledictions
against
the
aerial
monster
these
were
more
harmless
than
the
though
assuredly
if
the
aeronef
had
come
to
earth
she
would
have
certainly
been
torn
to
pieces
for
some
miles
noisy
flocks
of
storks
francolins
and
ibises
escorted
the
albatross
and
tried
to
race
her
but
in
her
rapid
flight
she
soon
distanced
them
the
evening
came
the
air
was
troubled
by
the
roarings
of
the
numerous
herds
of
elephants
and
buffaloes
which
wander
over
this
land
whose
fertility
is
simply
marvelous
for
hours
the
whole
of
the
region
between
the
prime
meridian
and
the
second
degree
in
the
bend
of
the
niger
was
viewed
from
the
albatross
if
a
geographer
had
only
such
an
apparatus
at
his
command
with
what
facility
could
he
map
the
country
note
the
elevations
fix
the
courses
of
the
rivers
and
their
affluents
and
determine
the
positions
of
the
towns
and
villages
there
would
then
be
no
huge
blanks
on
the
map
of
africa
no
dotted
lines
no
vague
designations
which
are
the
despair
of
cartographers
in
the
morning
of
the
the
albatross
crossed
the
mountains
of
northern
guinea
between
the
sudan
and
the
gulf
which
bears
their
name
on
the
horizon
was
the
confused
outline
of
the
kong
mountains
in
the
kingdom
of
dahomey
since
the
departure
from
timbuktu
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
noticed
that
the
course
had
been
due
south
if
that
direction
was
persisted
in
they
would
cross
the
equator
in
six
more
degrees
the
albatross
would
then
abandon
the
continents
and
fly
not
over
the
bering
sea
or
the
caspian
sea
or
the
north
sea
or
the
mediterranean
but
over
the
atlantic
ocean
this
was
not
particularly
pleasing
to
the
two
friends
whose
chances
of
escape
had
sunk
to
below
zero
but
the
albatross
had
slackened
speed
as
though
hesitating
to
leave
africa
behind
was
robur
thinking
of
going
back
no
but
his
attention
had
been
particularly
attracted
to
the
country
which
he
was
then
crossing
we
know
and
he
knew
that
the
kingdom
of
dahomey
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
strong
enough
to
hold
its
own
with
its
neighbor
ashantee
its
area
is
somewhat
small
being
contained
within
three
hundred
and
sixty
leagues
from
north
to
south
and
one
hundred
and
eighty
from
east
to
west
but
its
population
numbers
some
seven
or
eight
hundred
thousand
including
the
neighboring
independent
territories
of
whydah
and
ardrah
if
dahomey
is
not
a
large
country
it
is
often
talked
about
it
is
celebrated
for
the
frightful
cruelties
which
signalize
its
annual
festivals
and
by
its
human
sacrifices
fearful
hecatombs
intended
to
honor
the
sovereign
it
has
lost
and
the
sovereign
who
has
succeeded
him
it
is
even
a
matter
of
politeness
when
the
king
of
dahomey
receives
a
visit
from
some
high
personage
or
some
foreign
ambassador
to
give
him
a
surprise
present
of
a
dozen
heads
cut
off
in
his
honor
by
the
minister
of
justice
the
minghan
who
is
wonderfully
skillful
in
that
branch
of
his
duties
when
the
albatross
came
flying
over
dahomey
the
old
king
bahadou
had
just
died
and
the
whole
population
was
proceeding
to
the
enthronization
of
his
successor
hence
there
was
great
agitation
all
over
the
country
and
it
did
not
escape
robur
that
everybody
was
on
the
move
long
lines
of
dahomians
were
hurrying
along
the
roads
from
the
country
into
the
capital
abomey
well
kept
roads
radiating
among
vast
plains
clothed
with
giant
trees
immense
fields
of
manioc
magnificent
forests
of
palms
mimosas
such
was
the
country
whose
perfumes
mounted
to
the
albatross
while
many
parrots
and
cardinals
swarmed
among
the
trees
the
engineer
leaning
over
the
rail
seemed
deep
in
thought
and
exchanged
but
a
few
words
with
tom
turner
it
did
not
look
as
though
the
albatross
had
attracted
the
attention
of
those
moving
masses
which
were
often
invisible
under
the
impenetrable
roof
of
trees
this
was
doubtless
due
to
her
keeping
at
a
good
altitude
amid
a
bank
of
light
cloud
about
eleven
in
the
morning
the
capital
was
sighted
surrounded
by
its
walls
defended
by
a
fosse
measuring
twelve
miles
round
with
wide
regular
streets
on
the
flat
plain
and
a
large
square
on
the
northern
side
occupied
by
the
king
palace
this
huge
collection
of
buildings
is
commanded
by
a
terrace
not
far
from
the
place
of
sacrifice
during
the
festival
days
it
is
from
this
high
terrace
that
they
throw
the
prisoners
tied
up
in
wicker
baskets
and
it
can
be
imagined
with
what
fury
these
unhappy
wretches
are
cut
in
pieces
in
one
of
the
courtyards
which
divide
the
king
palace
there
were
drawn
up
four
thousand
warriors
one
of
the
contigents
of
the
royal
army
and
not
the
least
courageous
one
if
it
is
doubtful
if
there
are
any
amazons
an
the
river
of
that
name
there
is
no
doubt
of
there
being
amazons
at
dahomey
some
have
a
blue
shirt
with
a
blue
or
red
scarf
with
striped
trousers
and
a
white
cap
others
the
have
a
heavy
carbine
a
dagger
and
two
antelope
horns
fixed
to
their
heads
by
a
band
of
iron
the
have
a
tunic
and
as
weapons
blunderbusses
and
old
cast
cannons
and
another
brigade
consisting
of
vestal
virgins
pure
as
diana
have
blue
tunics
and
white
trousers
if
we
add
to
these
amazons
five
or
six
thousand
men
in
cotton
drawers
and
shirts
with
a
knotted
tuft
to
increase
their
stature
we
shall
have
passed
in
review
the
dahomian
army
abomey
on
this
day
was
deserted
the
sovereign
the
royal
family
the
masculine
and
feminine
army
and
the
population
had
all
gone
out
of
the
capital
to
a
vast
plain
a
few
miles
away
surrounded
by
magnificent
forests
on
this
plain
the
recognition
of
the
new
king
was
to
take
place
here
it
was
that
thousands
of
prisoners
taken
during
recent
razzias
were
to
be
immolated
in
his
honor
it
was
about
two
when
the
albatross
arrived
over
the
plain
and
began
to
descend
among
the
clouds
which
still
hid
her
from
the
dahomians
there
were
sixteen
thousand
people
at
least
come
from
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
from
whydah
and
kerapay
and
ardrah
and
tombory
and
the
most
distant
villages
the
new
king
a
sturdy
fellow
named
some
years
old
was
seated
on
a
hillock
shaded
by
a
group
of
trees
before
him
stood
his
male
army
his
amazons
and
his
people
at
the
foot
of
the
mound
fifty
musicians
were
playing
on
their
barbarous
instruments
elephants
tusks
giving
forth
a
husky
note
deerskin
drums
calabashes
guitars
bells
struck
with
an
iron
clapper
and
bamboo
flutes
whose
shrill
whistle
was
heard
over
all
every
other
second
came
discharges
of
guns
and
blunderbusses
discharges
of
cannons
with
the
carriages
jumping
so
as
to
imperil
the
lives
of
the
and
a
general
uproar
so
intense
that
even
the
thunder
would
be
unheard
amidst
it
in
one
corner
of
the
plain
under
a
guard
of
soldiers
were
grouped
the
prisoners
destined
to
accompany
the
defunct
king
into
the
other
world
at
the
obsequies
of
ghozo
the
father
of
bahadou
his
son
had
dispatched
three
thousand
and
could
not
do
less
than
his
predecessor
for
an
hour
there
was
a
series
of
discourses
harangues
palavers
and
dances
executed
not
only
by
professionals
but
by
the
amazons
who
displayed
much
martial
grace
but
the
time
for
the
hecatomb
was
approaching
robur
who
knew
the
customs
of
dahomey
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
men
women
and
children
reserved
for
butchery
the
minghan
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
hillock
he
was
brandishing
his
executioner
sword
with
its
curved
blade
surmounted
by
a
metal
bird
whose
weight
rendered
the
cut
more
certain
this
time
he
was
not
alone
he
could
not
have
performed
the
task
near
him
were
grouped
a
hundred
executioners
all
accustomed
to
cut
off
heads
at
one
blow
the
albatross
came
slowly
down
in
an
oblique
direction
soon
she
emerged
from
the
bed
of
clouds
which
hid
her
till
she
was
within
three
hundred
feet
of
the
ground
and
for
the
first
time
she
was
visible
from
below
contrary
to
what
had
hitherto
happened
the
savages
saw
in
her
a
celestial
being
come
to
render
homage
to
king
the
enthusiasm
was
indescribable
the
shouts
were
interminable
the
prayers
were
terrific
prayers
addressed
to
this
supernatural
hippogriff
which
had
doubtless
come
to
take
the
king
body
to
the
higher
regions
of
the
dahomian
heaven
and
now
the
first
head
fell
under
the
minghan
sword
and
the
prisoners
were
led
up
in
hundreds
before
the
horrible
executioners
suddenly
a
gun
was
fired
from
the
albatross
the
minister
of
justice
fell
dead
on
his
face
well
aimed
tom
said
robur
his
comrades
armed
as
he
was
stood
ready
to
fire
when
the
order
was
given
but
a
change
came
over
the
crowd
below
they
had
understood
the
winged
monster
was
not
a
friendly
spirit
it
was
a
hostile
spirit
and
after
the
fall
of
the
minghan
loud
shouts
for
revenge
arose
on
all
sides
almost
immediately
a
fusillade
resounded
over
the
plain
these
menaces
did
not
prevent
the
albatross
from
descending
boldly
to
within
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
of
the
ground
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
whatever
were
their
feelings
towards
robur
could
not
help
joining
him
in
such
a
work
of
humanity
let
us
free
the
prisoners
they
shouted
that
is
what
i
am
going
to
do
said
the
engineer
and
the
magazine
rifles
of
the
albatross
in
the
hands
of
the
colleagues
as
in
the
hands
of
the
crew
began
to
rain
down
the
bullets
of
which
not
one
was
lost
in
the
masses
below
and
the
little
gun
shot
forth
its
shrapnel
which
really
did
marvels
the
prisoners
although
they
did
not
understand
how
the
help
had
come
to
them
broke
their
bonds
while
the
soldiers
were
firing
at
the
aeronef
the
stern
screw
was
shot
through
by
a
bullet
and
a
few
holes
were
made
in
the
hull
frycollin
crouching
in
his
cabin
received
a
graze
from
a
bullet
that
came
through
the
ah
they
will
have
them
said
tom
turner
and
rushing
to
the
magazine
he
returned
with
a
dozen
dynamite
cartridges
which
he
distributed
to
the
men
at
a
sign
from
robur
these
cartridges
were
fired
at
the
hillock
and
as
they
reached
the
ground
exploded
like
so
many
small
shells
the
king
and
his
court
and
army
and
people
were
stricken
with
fear
at
the
turn
things
had
taken
they
fled
under
the
trees
while
the
prisoners
ran
off
without
anybody
thinking
of
pursuing
them
in
this
way
was
the
festival
interfered
with
and
in
this
way
did
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
recognize
the
power
of
the
aeronef
and
the
services
it
could
render
to
humanity
soon
the
albatross
rose
again
to
a
moderate
height
and
passing
over
whydah
lost
to
view
this
savage
coast
which
the
southwest
wind
hems
round
with
an
inaccessible
surf
and
she
flew
out
over
the
atlantic
chapter
xvi
over
the
atlantic
yes
the
atlantic
the
fears
of
the
two
colleagues
were
realized
but
it
did
not
seem
as
though
robur
had
the
least
anxiety
about
venturing
over
this
vast
ocean
both
he
and
his
men
seemed
quite
unconcerned
about
it
and
had
gone
back
to
their
stations
whither
was
the
albatross
bound
was
she
going
more
than
round
the
world
as
robur
had
said
even
if
she
were
the
voyage
must
end
somewhere
that
robur
spent
his
life
in
the
air
on
board
the
aeronef
and
never
came
to
the
ground
was
impossible
how
could
he
make
up
his
stock
of
provisions
and
the
materials
required
for
working
his
machines
he
must
have
some
retreat
some
harbor
of
refuge
in
some
unknown
and
inaccessible
spot
where
the
albatross
could
revictual
that
he
had
broken
off
all
connections
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
might
be
true
but
with
every
point
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
certainly
not
that
being
the
case
where
was
this
point
how
had
the
engineer
come
to
choose
it
was
he
expected
by
a
little
colony
of
which
he
was
the
chief
could
he
there
find
a
new
crew
what
means
had
he
that
he
should
be
able
to
build
so
costly
a
vessel
as
the
albatross
and
keep
her
building
secret
it
is
true
his
living
was
not
expensive
but
finally
who
was
this
robur
where
did
he
come
from
what
had
been
his
history
here
were
riddles
impossible
to
solve
and
robur
was
not
the
man
to
assist
willingly
in
their
solution
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
these
insoluble
problems
drove
the
colleagues
almost
to
frenzy
to
find
themselves
whipped
off
into
the
unknown
without
knowing
what
the
end
might
be
doubting
even
if
the
adventure
would
end
sentenced
to
perpetual
aviation
was
this
not
enough
to
drive
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
to
extremities
meanwhile
the
albatross
drove
along
above
the
atlantic
and
in
the
morning
when
the
sun
rose
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
circular
line
where
earth
met
sky
not
a
spot
of
land
was
insight
in
this
huge
field
of
vision
africa
had
vanished
beneath
the
northern
horizon
when
frycollin
ventured
out
of
his
cabin
and
saw
all
this
water
beneath
him
fear
took
possession
of
him
of
the
hundred
and
million
square
miles
of
which
the
area
of
the
world
waters
consists
the
atlantic
claims
about
a
quarter
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
engineer
was
in
no
hurry
to
cross
it
there
was
now
no
going
at
full
speed
none
of
the
hundred
and
twenty
miles
an
hour
at
which
the
albatross
had
flown
over
europe
here
where
the
southwest
winds
prevail
the
wind
was
ahead
of
them
and
though
it
was
not
very
strong
it
would
not
do
to
defy
it
and
the
albatross
was
sent
along
at
a
moderate
speed
which
however
easily
outstripped
that
of
the
fastest
on
the
of
july
she
crossed
the
line
and
the
fact
was
duly
announced
to
the
crew
it
was
then
that
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
ascertained
that
they
were
bound
for
the
southern
hemisphere
the
crossing
of
the
line
took
place
without
any
of
the
neptunian
ceremonies
that
still
linger
on
certain
ships
tapage
was
the
only
one
to
mark
the
event
and
he
did
so
by
pouring
a
pint
of
water
down
frycollin
neck
on
the
of
july
when
beyond
the
tropic
of
capricorn
another
phenomenon
was
noticed
which
would
have
been
somewhat
alarming
to
a
ship
on
the
sea
a
strange
succession
of
luminous
waves
widened
out
over
the
surface
of
the
ocean
with
a
speed
estimated
at
quite
sixty
miles
an
hour
the
waves
ran
along
at
about
eight
feet
from
one
another
tracing
two
furrows
of
light
as
night
fell
a
bright
reflection
rose
even
to
the
albatross
so
that
she
might
have
been
taken
for
a
flaming
aerolite
never
before
had
robur
sailed
on
a
sea
of
fire
fire
without
heat
which
there
was
no
need
to
flee
from
as
it
mounted
upwards
into
the
sky
the
cause
of
this
light
must
have
been
electricity
it
could
not
be
attributed
to
a
bank
of
fish
spawn
nor
to
a
crowd
of
those
animalculae
that
give
phosphorescence
to
the
sea
and
this
showed
that
the
electrical
tension
of
the
atmosphere
was
considerable
in
the
morning
an
ordinary
ship
would
probably
have
been
lost
but
the
albatross
played
with
the
winds
and
waves
like
the
powerful
bird
whose
name
she
bore
if
she
did
not
walk
on
their
surface
like
the
petrels
she
could
like
the
eagles
find
calm
and
sunshine
in
the
higher
zones
they
had
now
passed
the
parallel
the
day
was
but
little
over
seven
hours
long
and
would
become
even
less
as
they
approached
the
pole
about
one
in
the
afternoon
the
albatross
was
floating
along
in
a
lower
current
than
usual
about
a
hundred
feet
from
the
level
of
the
sea
the
air
was
calm
but
in
certain
parts
of
the
sky
were
thick
black
clouds
massed
in
mountains
on
their
upper
surface
and
ruled
off
below
by
a
sharp
horizontal
line
from
these
clouds
a
few
lengthy
protuberances
escaped
and
their
points
as
they
fell
seemed
to
draw
up
hills
of
foaming
water
to
meet
them
suddenly
the
water
shot
up
in
the
form
of
a
gigantic
hourglass
and
the
albatross
was
enveloped
in
the
eddy
of
an
enormous
waterspout
while
twenty
others
black
as
ink
raged
around
her
fortunately
the
gyratory
movement
of
the
water
was
opposite
to
that
of
the
suspensory
screws
otherwise
the
aeronef
would
have
been
hurled
into
the
sea
but
she
began
to
spin
round
on
herself
with
frightful
rapidity
the
danger
was
immense
and
perhaps
impossible
to
escape
for
the
engineer
could
not
get
through
the
spout
which
sucked
him
back
in
defiance
of
his
propellers
the
men
thrown
to
the
ends
of
the
deck
by
centrifugal
force
were
grasping
the
rail
to
save
themselves
from
being
shot
off
keep
cool
shouted
robur
they
wanted
all
their
coolness
and
their
patience
too
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
who
had
just
come
out
of
their
cabin
were
hurled
back
at
the
risk
of
flying
overboard
as
she
spun
the
albatross
was
carried
along
by
the
spout
which
pirouetted
along
the
waves
with
a
speed
enough
to
make
the
helices
jealous
and
if
she
escaped
from
the
spout
she
might
be
caught
by
another
and
jerked
to
pieces
with
the
shock
get
the
gun
ready
said
robur
the
order
was
given
to
tom
turner
who
was
crouching
behind
the
swivel
amidships
where
the
effect
of
the
centrifugal
force
was
least
felt
he
understood
in
a
moment
he
had
opened
the
breech
and
slipped
a
cartridge
from
the
at
hand
the
gun
went
off
and
the
waterspouts
collapsed
and
with
them
vanished
the
platform
of
cloud
they
seemed
to
bear
above
them
nothing
broken
on
board
asked
robur
no
answered
tom
turner
but
we
do
want
to
have
another
game
of
like
that
for
ten
minutes
or
so
the
albatross
had
been
in
extreme
peril
had
it
not
been
for
her
extraordinary
strength
of
build
she
would
have
been
lost
during
this
passage
of
the
atlantic
many
were
the
hours
whose
monotony
was
unbroken
by
any
phenomenon
whatever
the
days
grew
shorter
and
shorter
and
the
cold
became
keen
uncle

and
phil
evans
saw
little
of
robur
seated
in
his
cabin
the
engineer
was
busy
laying
out
his
course
and
marking
it
on
his
maps
taking
his
observations
whenever
he
could
recording
the
readings
of
his
barometers
thermometers
and
chronometers
and
making
full
entries
in

the
colleagues
wrapped
themselves
well
up
and
eagerly
watched
for
the
sight
of
land
to
the
southward
at
uncle
prudent
request
frycollin
tried
to
pump
the
cook
as
to
whither
the
engineer
was
bound
but
what
reliance
could
be
placed
on
the
information
given
by
this
gascon
sometimes
robur
was
an
of
the
argentine
republic
sometimes
a
lord
of
the
admiralty
sometimes
an
of
the
united
states
sometimes
a
spanish
general
temporarily
retired
sometimes
a
viceroy
of
the
indies
who
had
sought
a
more
elevated
position
in
the
air
sometimes
he
possessed
millions
thanks
to
successful
razzias
in
the
aeronef
and
he
had
been
proclaimed
for
piracy
sometimes
he
had
been
ruined
by
making
the
aeronef
and
had
been
forced
to
fly
aloft
to
escape
from
his
creditors
as
to
knowing
if
he
were
going
to
stop
anywhere
no
but
if
he
thought
of
going
to
the
moon
and
found
there
a
convenient
anchorage
he
would
anchor
there
eh
fry
my
boy
that
would
just
suit
you
to
see
what
was
going
on
up
there
i
shall
not
go
i
refuse
said
the
negro
who
took
all
these
things
seriously
and
why
fry
why
you
might
get
married
to
some
pretty
bouncing
lunarian
frycollin
reported
this
conversation
to
his
master
who
saw
it
was
evident
that
nothing
was
to
be
learnt
about
robur
and
so
he
thought
still
more
of
how
he
could
have
his
revenge
on
him
phil
said
he
one
day
is
it
quite
certain
that
escape
is
impossible
impossible
be
it
so
but
a
man
is
always
his
own
property
and
if
necessary
by
sacrificing
his
life
if
we
are
to
make
that
sacrifice
said
phil
evans
the
sooner
the
better
it
is
almost
time
to
end
this
where
is
the
albatross
going
here
we
are
flying
obliquely
over
the
atlantic
and
if
we
keep
on
we
shall
get
to
the
coast
of
patagonia
or
tierra
del

and
what
are
we
to
do
then
get
into
the
pacific
or
go
to
the
continent
at
the
south
pole
everything
is
possible
with
this
robur
we
shall
be
lost
in
the
end
it
is
thus
a
case
of
legitimate
and
if
we
must
perish
which
we
shall
not
do
answered
uncle
prudent
without
being
avenged
without
annihilating
this
machine
and
all
she
carries
the
colleagues
had
reached
a
stage
of
impotent
fury
and
were
prepared
to
sacrifice
themselves
if
they
could
only
destroy
the
inventor
and
his
secret
a
few
months
only
would
then
be
the
life
of
this
prodigious
aeronef
of
whose
superiority
in
aerial
locomotion
they
had
such
convincing
proofs
the
idea
took
such
hold
of
them
that
they
thought
of
nothing
else
but
how
to
put
it
into
execution
and
how
by
seizing
on
some
of
the
explosives
on
board
and
simply
blowing
her
up
but
could
they
get
at
the
magazines
fortunately
for
them
frycollin
had
no
suspicion
of
their
scheme
at
the
thought
of
the
albatross
exploding
in
midair
he
would
not
have
shrunk
from
betraying
his
master
it
was
on
the
of
july
that
the
land
reappeared
in
the
southwest
near
cape
virgins
at
the
entrance
of
the
straits
of
magellan
under
the
parallel
at
this
time
of

the
night
was
eighteen
hours
long
and
the
temperature
was
six
below
freezing
at
first
the
albatross
instead
of
keeping
on
to
the
south
followed
the
windings
of
the
coast
as
if
to
enter
the
pacific
after
passing
lomas
bay
leaving
mount
gregory
to
the
north
and
the
brecknocks
to
the
west
they
sighted
puerto
arena
a
small
chilean
village
at
the
moment
the
churchbells
were
in
full
swing
and
a
few
hours
later
they
were
over
the
old
settlement
at
port
famine
if
the
patagonians
whose
fires
could
be
seen
occasionally
were
really
above
the
average
in
stature
the
passengers
in
the
aeronef
were
unable
to
say
for
to
them
they
seemed
to
be
dwarfs
but
what
a
magnificent
landscape
opened
around
during
these
short
hours
of
the
southern
day
rugged
mountains
peaks
eternally
capped
with
snow
with
thick
forests
rising
on
their
flanks
inland
seas
bays
deep
set
amid
the
peninsulas
and
islands
of
the
archipelago
clarence

dawson
island
and
the
land
of
desolation
straits
and
channels
capes
and
promontories
all
in
inextricable
confusion
and

in
one

the

resumed
her

to
the

passing
between

on
the

she
steered
for

in

how
beautiful
and
fertile
would
most
of
this
country
be
particularly
in
its
northern
portion
then
all
around
would
be
seen
valleys
and
pasturages
that
could
form
the
of
thousands
of

then
would
appear
virgin
forests
gigantic
beeches
cypresses
and
broad
plains
overrun
by
herds
of
guanacos
vicunas

ostriches
now
there
were
armies
of
penguins
and
myriads
of
birds
and
when
the
albatross
turned
on
her
electric
lamps
the
guillemots
ducks

geese
came
crowding
on
board
enough
to
fill
tapage
larder
a
hundred
times

more
here
was
work
for
the
cook
who
knew
how
to
bring
out
the
flavor
of
the
game
and
keep
down
its
peculiar
oiliness
and
here
was
work
for
frycollin
in
plucking
dozen
after
dozen
of
such
interesting
feathered
friends
that
day
as
the
sun
was
setting
about
three
in
the
afternoon
there
appeared
in
sight
a
large
lake
framed
in
a
border
of
superb
forest
the
lake
was
completely
frozen
over
and
a
few
natives
with
long
snowshoes
on
their
feet
were
swiftly
gliding
over
it
at
the
sight
of
the
albatross
the
fuegians
overwhelmed
with
terror
scattered
in
all
directions
and
when
they
could
not
get
away
they
hid
themselves
taking
like
the
animals
to
the
holes
in
the
ground
the
albatross
still
held
her
southerly
course
crossing
the
beagle

and
navarin

and
wollaston
island
on
the

of

having

next
day
was
the
of

and
the
of
july
in
the

hemisphere
corresponds
to
the
of
january
in
the
northern
the
degree
of
latitude
had
been
left
behind
the
similar
parallel
in
northern
europe
runs
through
edinburgh
the
thermometer
kept
steadily
below
freezing
so
that
the
machinery
was
called
upon
to
furnish
a
little
artificial
heat
in
the
cabins
although
the
days
begin
to
lengthen
after
the
day
of
june
in
the
southern
hemisphere
yet
the
advance
of
the
albatross
towards
the
pole
more
than
neutralized
this
increase
and
consequently
the
daylight
became
very
short
there
was
thus
very
little
to
be
seen
at
night
time
the
cold
became
very
keen
but
as
there
was
no
scarcity
of
clothing
on
board
the
colleagues
well
wrapped
up
remained
a
good
deal
on
deck
thinking
over
their
plans
of
escape
and
watching
for
an
opportunity
little
was
seen
of
robur
since
the
high
words
that
had
been
exchanged
in
the
timbuktu
country
the
engineer
had
left
off
speaking
to
his
prisoners
frycollin
seldom
came
out
of
the
where
tapage
treated
him
most
hospitably
on
condition
that
he
acted
as
his
assistant
this
position
was
not
without
its
advantages
and
the
negro
with
his
master
permission
very
willingly
accepted
it
shut
up
in
the
galley
he
saw
nothing
of
what
was
passing
outside
and
might
even
consider
himself
beyond
the
reach
of
danger
he
was
in
fact
very
like
the
ostrich
not
only
in
his
stomach
but
in
his
folly
but
whither
went
the
albatross
was
she
in
bound
for
the
southern
seas
or
continents
round
the
pole
in
this
icy
atmosphere
even
granting
that
the
elements
of
the
batteries
were
unaffected
by
such
frost
would
not
all
the
crew
succumb
to
a
horrible
death
from
the
cold
that
robur
should
attempt
to
cross
the
pole
in
the
warm
season
was
bad
enough
but
to
attempt
such
a
thing
in
the
depth
of
the
winter
night
would
be
the
act
of
a
madman
thus
reasoned
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
now
they
had
been
brought
to
the
end
of
the
continent
of
the
new
world
which
is
still
america
although
it
does
not
belong
to
the
united
states
what
was
this
intractable
robur
going
to
do
had
not
the
time
arrived
for
them
to
end
the
voyage
by
blowing
up
the
ship
it
was
noticed
that
during
the
of
july
the
engineer
had
frequent
consultations
with
his
mate
he
and
tom
turner
kept
constant
watch
on
the
barometer
not
so
much
to
keep
themselves
informed
of
the
height
at
which
they
were
traveling
as
to
be
on
the
for
a
change
in
the
weather
evidently
some
indications
had
been
observed
of
which
it
was
necessary
to
make
careful
note
uncle
prudent
also
remarked
that
robur
had
been
taking
stock
of
the
provisions
and
stores
and
everything
seemed
to
show
that
he
was
contemplating
turning
back
turning
back
said
phil
evans
but
where
to
where
he
can
reprovision
the
ship
said
uncle
prudent
that
ought
to
be
in
some
lonely
island
in
the
pacific
with
a
colony
of
scoundrels
worthy
of
their
chief
that
is
what
i
think
i
fancy
he
is
going
west
and
with
the
speed
he
can
get
up
it
would
not
take
him
long
to
get
home
but
we
should
not
be
able
to
put
our
plan
into
execution
if
we
get
there
we
shall
not
get
there
the
colleagues
had
partly
guessed
the
engineer
intentions
during
the
day
it
became
no
longer
doubtful
that
when
the
albatross
reached
the
confines
of
the
antarctic
sea
her
course
was
to
be
changed
when
the
ice
has
formed
about
cape
horn
the
lower
regions
of
the
pacific
are
covered
with
icefields
and
icebergs
the
floes
then
form
an
impenetrable
barrier
to
the
strongest
ships
and
the
boldest
navigators
of
course
by
increasing
the
speed
of
her
wings
the
albatross
could
clear
the
mountains
of
ice
accumulated
on
the
ocean
as
she
could
the
mountains
of
earth
on
the
polar
continent
if
it
is
a
continent
that
forms
the
cap
of
the
southern
pole
but
would
she
attempt
it
in
the
middle
of
the
polar
night
in
an
atmosphere
of
sixty
below
freezing
after
she
had
advanced
about
a
hundred
miles
to
the
south
the
albatross
headed
westerly
as
if
for
some
unknown
island
of
the
pacific
beneath
her
stretched
the
liquid
plain
between
asia
and
america
the
waters
now
had
assumed
that
singular
color
which
has
earned
for
them
the
name
of
the
milky
sea
in
the
half
shadow
which
the
enfeebled
rays
of
the
sun
were
unable
to
dissipate
the
surface
of
the
pacific
was
a
milky
white
it
seemed
like
a
vast
snowfield
whose
undulations
were
imperceptible
at
such
a
height
if
the
sea
had
been
solidified
by
the
cold
and
converted
into
an
immense
icefield
its
aspect
could
not
have
been
much
different
they
knew
that
the
phenomenon
was
produced
by
myriads
of
luminous
particles
of
phosphorescent
corpuscles
but
it
was
surprising
to
come
across
such
an
opalescent
mass
beyond
the
limits
of
the
indian
ocean
suddenly
the
barometer
fell
after
keeping
somewhat
high
during
the
earlier
hours
of
the
day
evidently
the
indications
were
such
as
a
shipmaster
might
feel
anxious
at
though
the
master
of
an
aeronef
might
despise
them
there
was
every
sign
that
a
terrible
storm
had
recently
raged
in
the
pacific
it
was
one
in
the
afternoon
when
tom
turner
came
up
to
the
engineer
and
said
do
you
see
that
black
spot
on
the
horizon
sir
there
away
to
due
north
of
us
that
is
not
a
rock
no
tom
there
is
no
land
out
there
then
it
must
be
a
ship
or
a
boat
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
who
were
in
the
bow
looked
in
the
direction
pointed
out
by
the
mate
robur
asked
for
the
glass
and
attentively
observed
the
object
it
is
a
boat
said
he
and
there
are
some
men
in
it
shipwrecked
asked
tom
yes
they
have
had
to
abandon
their
ship
and
knowing
nothing
of
the
nearest
land
are
perhaps
dying
of
hunger
and
thirst
well
it
shall
not
be
said
that
the
albatross
did
not
come
to
their
help
the
orders
were
given
and
the
aeronef
began
to
sink
towards
the
sea
at
three
hundred
yards
from
it
the
descent
was
stopped
and
the
propellers
drove
ahead
full
speed
towards
the
north
it
was
a
boat
her
sail
flapped
against
the
mast
as
she
rose
and
fell
on
the
waves
there
was
no
wind
and
she
was
making
no
progress
doubtless
there
was
no
one
on
board
with
strength
enough
left
to
work
the
oars
in
the
boat
were
five
men
asleep
or
helpless
if
they
were
not
dead
the
albatross
had
arrived
above
them
and
slowly
descended
on
the
boat
stern
was
the
name
of
the
ship
to
which
she
belonged
the
jeannette
of
nantes
hallo
there
shouted
turner
loud
enough
for
the
men
to
hear
for
the
boat
was
only
eighty
feet
below
him
there
was
no
answer
fire
a
gun
said
robur
the
gun
was
fired
and
the
report
rang
out
over
the
sea
one
of
the
men
looked
up
feebly
his
eyes
were
haggard
and
his
face
was
that
of
a
skeleton
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
albatross
he
made
a
gesture
as
of
fear
do
be
afraid
said
robur
in
french
we
have
come
to
help
you
who
are
you
we
belong
to
the
barque
jeannette
and
i
am
the
mate
we
left
her
a
fortnight
ago
as
she
was
sinking
we
have
no
water
and
no
food
the
four
other
men
had
now
sat
up
wan
and
exhausted
in
a
terrible
state
of
emaciation
they
lifted
their
hands
towards
the
albatross
shouted
robur
a
line
was
let
down
and
a
pail
of
fresh
water
was
lowered
into
the
boat
the
men
snatched
at
it
and
drank
it
with
an
eagerness
awful
to
see
bread
bread
they
exclaimed
immediately
a
basket
with
some
food
and
five
pints
of
coffee
descended
towards
them
the
mate
with
difficulty
restrained
them
in
their
ravenousness
where
are
we
asked
the
mate
at
last
fifty
miles
from
the
chili
coast
and
the
chonos
archipelago
answered
robur
thanks
but
we
are
becalmed
and
we
are
going
to
tow
you
who
are
you
people
who
are
glad
to
be
of
assistance
to
you
said
robur
the
mate
understood
that
the
incognito
was
to
be
respected
but
had
the
flying
machine
sufficient
power
to
tow
them
through
the
water
yes
and
the
boat
attached
to
a
hundred
feet
of
rope
began
to
move
off
towards
the
east
at
ten
at
night
the
land
was
sighted
or
rather
they
could
see
the
lights
which
indicated
its
position
this
rescue
from
the
sky
had
come
just
in
time
for
the
survivors
of
the
jeannette
and
they
had
good
reason
to
believe
it
miraculous
when
they
had
been
taken
to
the
mouth
of
the
channel
leading
among
the
chonos
islands
robur
shouted
to
them
to
cast
off
the
this
with
many
a
blessing
to
those
who
had
saved
them
they
did
and
the
albatross
headed
out
to
the
offing
certainly
there
was
some
good
in
this
aeronef
which
could
thus
help
those
who
were
lost
at
sea
what
balloon
perfect
as
it
might
be
would
be
able
to
perform
such
a
service
and
between
themselves
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
could
not
but
admire
it
although
they
were
quite
disposed
to
deny
the
evidence
of
their
senses
chapter
xviii
over
the
volcano
the
sea
was
as
rough
as
ever
and
the
symptoms
became
alarming
the
barometer
fell
several
millimeters
the
wind
came
in
violent
gusts
and
then
for
a
moment
or
so
failed
altogether
under
such
circumstances
a
sailing
vessel
would
have
had
to
reef
in
her
topsails
and
her
foresail
everything
showed
that
the
wind
was
rising
in
the
northwest
the
became
much
troubled
and
its
movements
were
most
disquieting
at
one
in
the
morning
the
wind
came
on
again
with
extreme
violence
although
the
aeronef
was
going
right
in
its
teeth
she
was
still
making
progress
at
a
rate
of
from
twelve
to
fifteen
miles
an
hour
but
that
was
the
utmost
she
could
do
evidently
preparations
must
be
made
for
a
cyclone
a
very
rare
occurrence
in
these
latitudes
whether
it
be
called
a
hurricane
as
in
the
atlantic
a
typhoon
as
in
chinese
waters
a
simoom
as
in
the
sahara
or
a
tornado
as
on
the
western
coast
such
a
storm
is
always
a
gyratory
one
and
most
dangerous
for
any
ship
caught
in
the
current
which
increases
from
the
circumference
to
the
center
and
has
only
one
spot
of
calm
the
middle
of
the
vortex
robur
knew
this
he
also
knew
it
was
best
to
escape
from
the
cyclone
and
get
beyond
its
zone
of
attraction
by
ascending
to
the
higher
strata
up
to
then
he
had
always
succeeded
in
doing
this
but
now
he
had
not
an
hour
perhaps
not
a
minute
to
lose
in
fact
the
violence
of
the
wind
sensibly
increased
the
crests
of
the
waves
were
swept
off
as
they
rose
and
blown
into
white
dust
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
it
was
manifest
that
the
cyclone
was
advancing
with
fearful
velocity
straight
towards
the
regions
of
the
pole
higher
said
robur
higher
it
is
said
tom
tumor
an
extreme
ascensional
power
was
communicated
to
the
aeronef
and
she
shot
up
slantingly
as
if
she
was
traveling
on
a
plane
sloping
downwards
from
the
southwest
suddenly
the
barometer
fell
more
than
a
dozen
millimeters
and
the
albatross
paused
in
her
ascent
what
was
the
cause
of
the
stoppage
evidently
she
was
pulled
back
by
the
air
some
formidable
current
had
diminished
the
resistance
to
the
screws
when
a
steamer
travels
upstream
more
work
is
got
out
of
her
screw
than
when
the
water
is
running
between
the
blades
the
recoil
is
then
considerable
and
may
perhaps
be
as
great
as
the
current
it
was
thus
with
the
albatross
at
this
moment
but
robur
was
not
the
man
to
give
in
his
screws
working
perfectly
together
were
driven
at
their
maximum
speed
but
the
aeronef
could
not
escape
the
attraction
of
the
cyclone
was
irresistible
during
the
few
moments
of
calm
she
began
to
ascend
but
the
heavy
pull
soon
drew
her
back
and
she
sunk
like
a
ship
as
she
founders
evidently
if
the
violence
of
the
cyclone
went
on
increasing
the
albatross
would
be
but
as
a
straw
caught
in
one
of
those
whirlwinds
that
root
up
the
trees
carry
off
roofs
and
blow
down
walls
robur
and
tom
could
only
speak
by
signs
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
clung
to
the
rail
and
wondered
if
the
cyclone
was
not
playing
their
game
in
destroying
the
aeronef
and
with
her
the
inventor
and
with
the
inventor
the
secret
of
his
invention
but
if
the
albatross
could
not
get
out
of
the
cyclone
vertically
could
she
not
do
something
else
could
she
not
gain
the
center
where
it
was
comparatively
calm
and
where
they
would
have
more
control
over
her
quite
so
but
to
do
this
she
would
have
to
break
through
the
circular
currents
which
were
sweeping
her
round
with
them
had
she
sufficient
mechanical
power
to
escape
through
them
suddenly
the
upper
part
of
the
cloud
fell
in
the
vapor
condensed
in
torrents
of
rain
it
was
two
in
the
morning
the
barometer
oscillating
over
a
range
of
twelve
millimeters
had
now
fallen
to
and
from
this
something
should
be
taken
on
account
of
the
height
of
the
aeronef
above
the
level
of
the
sea
strange
to
say
the
cyclone
was
out
of
the
zone
to
which
such
storms
are
generally
restricted
such
zone
being
bounded
by
the
thirtieth
parallel
of
north
latitude
and
the
parallel
of
south
latitude
this
may
perhaps
explain
why
the
eddying
storm
suddenly
turned
into
a
straight
one
but
what
a
hurricane
the
tempest
in
connecticut
on
the
of
march
could
only
have
been
compared
to
it
and
the
speed
of
that
was
more
than
three
hundred
miles
an
hour
the
albatross
had
thus
to
fly
before
the
wind
or
rather
she
had
to
be
left
to
be
driven
by
the
current
from
which
she
could
neither
mount
nor
escape
but
in
following
this
unchanging
trajectory
she
was
bearing
due
south
towards
those
polar
regions
which
robur
had
endeavored
to
avoid
and
now
he
was
no
longer
master
of
her
course
she
would
go
where
the
hurricane
took
her
tom
turner
was
at
the
helm
and
it
required
all
his
skill
to
keep
her
straight
in
the
first
hours
of
the
morning
if
we
can
so
call
the
vague
tint
which
began
to
rise
over
the
horizon
the
albatross
was
fifteen
degrees
below
cape
horn
twelve
hundred
miles
more
and
she
would
cross
the
antarctic
circle
where
she
was
in
this
month
of
july
the
night
lasted
nineteen
hours
and
a
half
the
sun
disk
without
warmth
without
light
only
appeared
above
the
horizon
to
disappear
almost
immediately
at
the
pole
the
night
lengthened
into
one
of
a
hundred
and
days
everything
showed
that
the
albatross
was
about
to
plunge
into
an
abyss
during
the
day
an
observation
had
it
been
possible
would
have
given
south
latitude
the
aeronef
was
within
fourteen
hundred
miles
of
the
pole
irresistibly
was
she
drawn
towards
this
inaccessible
corner
of
the
globe
her
speed
eating
up
so
to
speak
her
weight
although
she
weighed
less
than
before
owing
to
the
flattening
of
the
earth
at
the
pole
it
seemed
as
though
she
could
have
dispensed
altogether
with
her
suspensory
screws
and
soon
the
fury
of
the
storm
reached
such
a
height
that
robur
thought
it
best
to
reduce
the
speed
of
her
helices
as
much
as
possible
so
as
to
avoid
disaster
and
only
enough
speed
was
given
to
keep
the
aeronef
under
control
of
the
rudder
amid
these
dangers
the
engineer
retained
his
imperturbable
coolness
and
the
crew
obeyed
him
as
if
their
leader
mind
had
entered
into
them
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
had
not
for
a
moment
left
the
deck
they
could
remain
without
being
disturbed
the
air
made
but
slight
resistance
the
aeronef
was
like
an
aerostat
which
drifts
with
the
fluid
masses
in
which
it
is
plunged
is
the
domain
of
the
southern
pole
a
continent
or
an
archipelago
or
is
it
a
palaeocrystic
sea
whose
ice
melts
not
even
during
the
long
summer
we
know
not
but
what
we
do
know
is
that
the
southern
pole
is
colder
than
the
northern
one
a
phenomenon
due
to
the
position
of
the
earth
in
its
orbit
during
winter
in
the
antarctic
regions
during
this
day
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
the
storm
was
abating
it
was
by
the
meridian
to
the
west
that
the
albatross
crossed
into
the
circumpolar
region
by
what
meridian
would
she
come
out
if
she
ever
came
out
as
she
descended
more
to
the
south
the
length
of
the
day
diminished
before
long
she
would
be
plunged
in
that
continuous
night
which
is
illuminated
only
by
the
rays
of
the
moon
or
the
pale
streamers
of
the
aurora
but
the
moon
was
then
new
and
the
companions
of
robur
might
see
nothing
of
the
regions
whose
secret
has
hitherto
defied
human
curiosity
there
was
not
much
inconvenience
on
board
from
the
cold
for
the
temperature
was
not
nearly
so
low
as
was
expected
it
seemed
as
though
the
hurricane
was
a
sort
of
gulf
stream
carrying
a
certain
amount
of
heat
along
with
it
great
was
the
regret
that
the
whole
region
was
in
such
profound
obscurity
even
if
the
moon
had
been
in
full
glory
but
few
observations
could
have
been
made
at
this
season
of
the
year
an
immense
curtain
of
snow
an
icy
carapace
covers
up
the
polar
surface
there
was
none
of
that
ice
blink
to
be
seen
that
whitish
tint
of
which
the
reflection
is
absent
from
dark
horizons
under
such
circumstances
how
could
they
distinguish
the
shape
of
the
ground
the
extent
of
the
seas
the
position
of
the
islands
how
could
they
recognize
the
hydrographic
network
of
the
country
or
the
orographic
configuration
and
distinguish
the
hills
and
mountains
from
the
icebergs
and
floes
a
little
after
midnight
an
aurora
illuminated
the
darkness
with
its
silver
fringes
and
spangles
radiating
over
space
it
seemed
like
a
huge
fan
open
over
half
the
sky
its
farthest
electric
effluences
were
lost
in
the
southern
cross
whose
four
bright
stars
were
gleaming
overhead
the
phenomenon
was
one
of
incomparable
magnificence
and
the
light
showed
the
face
of
the
country
as
a
confused
mass
of
white
it
need
not
be
said
that
they
had
approached
so
near
to
the
pole
that
the
compass
was
constantly
affected
and
gave
no
precise
indication
of
the
course
pursued
its
inclination
was
such
that
at
one
time
robur
felt
certain
they
were
passing
over
the
magnetic
pole
discovered
by
sir
james
ross
and
an
hour
later
in
calculating
the
angle
the
needle
made
with
the
vertical
he
exclaimed
the
south
pole
is
beneath
us
a
white
cap
appeared
but
nothing
could
be
seen
of
what
it
bid
under
its
ice
a
few
minutes
afterwards
the
aurora
died
away
and
the
point
where
all
the
world
meridians
cross
is
still
to
be
discovered
if
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
wished
to
bury
in
the
most
mysterious
solitudes
the
aeronef
and
all
she
bore
the
moment
was
propitious
if
they
did
not
do
so
it
was
doubtless
because
the
explosive
they
required
was
still
denied
to
them
the
hurricane
still
raged
and
swept
along
with
such
rapidity
that
had
a
mountain
been
met
with
the
aeronef
would
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
like
a
ship
on
a
lee
shore
not
only
had
the
power
gone
to
steer
her
horizontally
but
the
control
of
her
elevation
had
also
vanished
and
it
was
not
unlikely
that
mountains
did
exist
in
these
antarctic
lands
any
instant
a
shock
might
happen
which
would
destroy
the
albatross
such
a
catastrophe
became
more
probable
as
the
wind
shifted
more
to
the
east
after
they
passed
the
prime
meridian
two
luminous
points
then
showed
themselves
ahead
of
the
albatross
there
were
the
two
volcanos
of
the
ross
mountains
erebus
and
terror
was
the
albatross
to
be
shriveled
up
in
their
flames
like
a
gigantic
butterfly
an
hour
of
intense
excitement
followed
one
of
the
volcanoes
erebus
seemed
to
be
rushing
at
the
aeronef
which
could
not
move
from
the
bed
of
the
hurricane
the
cloud
of
flame
grew
as
they
neared
it
a
network
of
fire
barred
their
road
a
brilliant
light
shone
round
over
all
the
figures
on
board
stood
out
in
the
bright
light
as
if
come
from
another
world
motionless
without
a
sound
or
a
gesture
they
waited
for
the
terrible
moment
when
the
furnace
would
wrap
them
in
its
fires
but
the
storm
that
bore
the
albatross
saved
them
from
such
a
fearful
fate
the
flames
of
erebus
were
blown
down
by
the
hurricane
as
it
passed
and
the
albatross
flew
over
unhurt
she
swept
through
a
hail
of
ejected
material
which
was
fortunately
kept
at
bay
by
the
centrifugal
action
of
the
suspensory
screws
and
she
harmlessly
passed
over
the
crater
while
it
was
in
full
eruption
an
hour
afterwards
the
horizon
hid
from
their
view
the
two
colossal
torches
which
light
the
confines
of
the
world
during
the
long
polar
night
at
two
in
the
morning
balleny
island
was
sighted
on
the
coast
of
discovery
land
though
it
could
not
be
recognized
owing
to
its
being
bound
to
the
mainland
by
a
cement
of
ice
and
the
albatross
emerged
from
the
polar
circle
on
the
hundred
and
meridian
the
hurricane
had
carried
her
over
the
icebergs
and
icefloes
against
which
she
was
in
danger
of
being
dashed
a
hundred
times
or
more
she
was
not
in
the
hands
of
the
helmsman
but
in
the
hand
of
god
and
god
is
a
good
pilot
the
aeronef
sped
along
to
the
north
and
at
the
sixtieth
parallel
the
storm
showed
signs
of
dying
away
its
violence
sensibly
diminished
the
albatross
began
to
come
under
control
again
and
what
was
a
great
comfort
had
again
entered
the
lighted
regions
of
the
globe
and
the
day
reappeared
about
eight
in
the
morning
robur
had
been
carried
by
the
storm
into
the
pacific
over
the
polar
region
accomplishing
four
thousand
three
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
nineteen
hours
or
about
three
miles
a
minute
a
speed
almost
double
that
which
the
albatross
was
equal
to
with
her
propellers
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
he
did
not
know
where
he
then
was
owing
to
the
disturbance
of
the
needle
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
magnetic
pole
and
he
would
have
to
wait
till
the
sun
shone
out
under
convenient
conditions
for
observation
unfortunately
heavy
clouds
covered
the
sky
all
that
day
and
the
sun
did
not
appear
this
was
a
disappointment
more
keenly
felt
as
both
propelling
screws
had
sustained
damage
during
the
tempest
robur
much
disconcerted
at
this
accident
could
only
advance
at
a
moderate
speed
during
this
day
and
when
he
passed
over
the
antipodes
of
paris
was
only
going
about
eighteen
miles
an
hour
it
was
necessary
not
to
aggravate
the
damage
to
the
screws
for
if
the
propellers
were
rendered
useless
the
situation
of
the
aeronef
above
the
vast
seas
of
the
pacific
would
be
a
very
awkward
one
and
the
engineer
began
to
consider
if
he
could
not
effect
his
repairs
on
the
spot
so
as
to
make
sure
of
continuing
his
voyage
in
the
morning
of
the
of
july
about
seven
land
was
sighted
to
the
north
it
was
soon
seen
to
be
an
island
but
which
island
was
it
of
the
thousands
that
dot
the
pacific
however
robur
decided
to
stop
at
it
without
landing
he
thought
that
he
could
repair
damages
during
the
day
and
start
in
the
evening
the
wind
had
died
away
completely
and
this
was
a
favorable
circumstance
for
the
maneuver
he
desired
to
execute
at
least
if
she
did
not
remain
stationary
the
albatross
would
be
carried
he
knew
not
where
a
cable
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
with
an
anchor
at
the
end
was
dropped
overboard
when
the
aeronef
reached
the
shore
of
the
island
the
anchor
dragged
up
the
first
few
rocks
and
then
got
firmly
fixed
between
two
large
blocks
the
cable
then
stretched
to
full
length
under
the
influence
of
the
suspensory
screws
and
the
albatross
remained
motionless
riding
like
a
ship
in
a
roadstead
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
fastened
to
the
earth
since
she
left
philadelphia
chapter
xix
anchored
at
last
when
the
albatross
was
high
in
the
air
the
island
could
be
seen
to
be
of
moderate
size
but
on
what
parallel
was
it
situated
what
meridian
ran
through
it
was
it
an
island
in
the
pacific
in
australasia
or
in
the
indian
ocean
when
the
sun
appeared
and
robur
had
taken
his
observations
they
would
know
but
although
they
could
not
trust
to
the
indications
of
the
compass
there
was
reason
to
think
they
were
in
the
pacific
at
this
height
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
the
island
which
measured
about
fifteen
miles
round
was
like
a
star
in
the
sea
off
the
southwest
point
was
an
islet
and
a
range
of
rocks
on
the
shore
there
were
no
and
this
tended
to
confirm
robur
in
his
opinion
as
to
his
position
for
the
ebb
and
flow
are
almost
imperceptible
in
the
pacific
at
the
northwest
point
there
was
a
conical
mountain
about
two
hundred
feet
high
no
natives
were
to
be
seen
but
they
might
be
on
the
opposite
coast
in
any
case
if
they
had
perceived
the
aeronef
terror
had
made
them
either
hide
themselves
or
run
away
the
albatross
had
anchored
on
the
southwest
point
of
the
island
not
far
off
down
a
little
creek
a
small
river
flowed
in
among
the
rocks
beyond
were
several
winding
valleys
trees
of
different
kinds
and
birds
partridges
and
bustards
in
great
numbers
if
the
island
was
not
inhabited
it
was
habitable
robur
might
surely
have
landed
on
it
if
he
had
not
done
so
it
was
probably
because
the
ground
was
uneven
and
did
not
offer
a
convenient
spot
to
beach
the
aeronef
while
he
was
waiting
for
the
sun
the
engineer
began
the
repairs
he
reckoned
on
completing
before
the
day
was
over
the
suspensory
screws
were
undamaged
and
had
worked
admirably
amid
all
the
violence
of
the
storm
which
as
we
have
said
had
considerably
lightened
their
work
at
this
moment
half
of
them
were
in
action
enough
to
keep
the
albatross
fixed
to
the
shore
by
the
taut
cable
but
the
two
propellers
had
suffered
and
more
than
robur
had
thought
their
blades
would
have
to
be
adjusted
and
the
gearing
seen
to
by
which
they
received
their
rotatory
movement
it
was
the
screw
at
the
bow
which
was
first
attacked
under
superintendence
it
was
the
best
to
commence
with
in
case
the
albatross
had
to
leave
before
the
work
was
finished
with
only
this
propeller
he
could
easily
keep
a
proper
course
meanwhile
uncle
prudent
and
his
colleague
after
walking
about
the
deck
had
sat
down
aft
frycollin
was
strangely
reassured
what
a
difference
to
be
suspended
only
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
from
the
ground
the
work
was
only
interrupted
for
a
moment
while
the
elevation
of
the
sun
above
the
horizon
allowed
robur
to
take
an
horary
angle
so
that
at
the
time
of
its
culmination
he
could
calculate
his
position
the
result
of
the
observation
taken
with
the
greatest
exactitude
was
as
follows
longitude
west
latitude
south
this
point
on
the
map
answered
to
the
position
of
the
chatham
islands
and
particularly
of
pitt
island
one
of
the
group
that
is
nearer
than
i
supposed
said
robur
to
tom
turner
how
far
off
are
we
degrees
south
of
x
island
or
two
thousand
eight
hundred
miles
all
the
more
reason
to
get
our
propellers
into
order
said
the
mate
we
may
have
the
wind
against
us
this
passage
and
with
the
little
stores
we
have
left
we
ought
to
get
to
x
as
soon
as
possible
yes
tom
and
i
hope
to
get
under
way
tonight
even
if
i
go
with
one
screw
and
put
the
other
on
the
voyage
robur
said
tom
what
is
to
be
done
with
those
two
gentlemen
and
their
servant
do
you
think
they
would
complain
if
they
became
colonists
of
x
island
but
where
was
this
x
it
was
an
island
lost
in
the
immensity
of
the
pacific
ocean
between
the
equator
and
the
tropic
of
cancer
an
island
most
appropriately
named
by
robur
in
this
algebraic
fashion
it
was
in
the
north
of
the
south
pacific
a
long
way
out
of
the
route
of
communication
there
it
was
that
robur
had
founded
his
little
colony
and
there
the
albatross
rested
when
tired
with
her
flight
there
she
was
provisioned
for
all
her
voyages
in
x
island
robur
a
man
of
immense
wealth
had
established
a
shipyard
in
which
he
built
his
aeronef
there
he
could
repair
it
and
even
rebuild
it
in
his
warehouses
were
materials
and
provisions
of
all
sorts
stored
for
the
fifty
inhabitants
who
lived
on
the
island
when
robur
had
doubled
cape
horn
a
few
days
before
his
intention
had
been
to
regain
x
island
by
crossing
the
pacific
obliquely
but
the
cyclone
had
seized
the
albatross
and
the
hurricane
had
carried
her
away
to
the
south
in
fact
he
had
been
brought
back
to
much
the
same
latitude
as
before
and
if
his
propellers
had
not
been
damaged
the
delay
would
have
been
of
no
importance
his
object
was
therefore
to
get
back
to
x
island
but
as
the
mate
had
said
the
voyage
would
be
a
long
one
and
the
winds
would
probably
be
against
them
the
mechanical
power
of
the
albatross
was
however
quite
equal
to
taking
her
to
her
destination
and
under
ordinary
circumstances
she
would
be
there
in
three
or
four
days
hence
robur
resolve
to
anchor
on
the
chatham
islands
there
was
every
opportunity
for
repairing
at
least
the
he
had
no
fear
that
if
the
wind
were
to
rise
he
would
be
driven
to
the
south
instead
of
to
the
north
when
night
came
the
repairs
would
be
finished
and
he
would
have
to
maneuver
so
as
to
weigh
anchor
if
it
were
too
firmly
fixed
in
the
rocks
he
could
cut
the
cable
and
resume
his
flight
towards
the
equator
the
crew
of
the
albatross
knowing
there
was
no
time
to
lose
set
to
work
vigorously
while
they
were
busy
in
the
bow
of
the
aeronef
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
held
a
little
conversation
together
which
had
exceptionally
important
consequences
phil
evans
said
uncle
prudent
you
have
resolved
as
i
have
to
sacrifice
your
life
yes
like
you
it
is
evident
that
we
can
expect
nothing
from
robur
nothing
well
phil
evans
i
have
made
up
my
mind
if
the
albatross
leaves
this
place
tonight
the
night
will
not
pass
without
our
having
accomplished
our
task
we
will
smash
the
wings
of
this
bird
of
robur
this
night
i
will
blow
it
into
the
air
the
sooner
the
better
said
phil
evans
it
will
be
seen
that
the
two
colleagues
were
agreed
on
all
points
even
in
accepting
with
indifference
the
frightful
death
in
store
for
them
have
you
all
you
want
asked
evans
yes
last
night
while
robur
and
his
people
had
enough
to
do
to
look
after
the
safety
of
the
ship
i
slipped
into
the
magazine
and
got
hold
of
a
dynamite
cartridge
let
us
set
to
work
uncle
prudent
no
wait
till
tonight
when
the
night
comes
we
will
go
into
our
cabin
and
you
shall
see
something
that
will
surprise
you
at
six
the
colleagues
dined
together
as
usual
two
hours
afterwards
they
retired
to
their
cabin
like
men
who
wished
to
make
up
for
a
sleepless
night
neither
robur
nor
any
of
his
companions
had
a
suspicion
of
the
catastrophe
that
threatened
the
albatross
this
was
uncle
prudent
plan
as
he
had
said
he
had
stolen
into
the
magazine
and
there
had
possessed
himself
of
some
powder
and
cartridge
like
those
used
by
robur
in
dahomey
returning
to
his
cabin
he
had
carefully
concealed
the
cartridge
with
which
he
had
resolved
to
blow
up
the
albatross
in
phil
evans
screened
by
his
companion
was
now
examining
the
infernal
machine
which
was
a
metallic
canister
containing
about
two
pounds
of
dynamite
enough
to
shatter
the
aeronef
to
atoms
if
the
explosion
did
not
destroy
her
at
once
it
would
do
so
in
her
fall
nothing
was
easier
than
to
place
this
cartridge
in
a
corner
of
the
cabin
so
that
it
would
blow
in
the
deck
and
tear
away
the
framework
of
the
hull
but
to
obtain
the
explosion
it
was
necessary
to
adjust
the
fulminating
cap
with
which
the
cartridge
was
fitted
this
was
the
most
delicate
part
of
the
operation
for
the
explosion
would
have
to
be
carefully
timed
so
as
not
to
occur
too
soon
or
too
late
uncle
prudent
had
carefully
thought
over
the
matter
his
conclusions
were
as
follows
as
soon
as
the
fore
propeller
was
repaired
the
aeronef
would
resume
her
course
to
the
north
and
that
done
robur
and
his
crew
would
probably
come
aft
to
put
the
other
screw
into
order
the
presence
of
these
people
about
the
cabin
might
interfere
with
his
plans
and
so
he
had
resolved
to
make
a
slow
match
do
duty
as
a
when
i
got
the
cartridge
said
he
to
phil
evans
i
took
some
gunpowder
as
well
with
the
powder
i
will
make
a
fuse
that
will
take
some
time
to
burn
and
which
will
lead
into
the
fulminate
my
idea
is
to
light
it
about
midnight
so
that
the
explosion
will
take
place
about
three
or
four
in
the
morning
well
planned
said
phil
evans
the
colleagues
as
we
see
had
arrived
at
such
a
stage
as
to
look
with
the
greatest
nonchalance
on
the
awful
destruction
in
which
they
were
about
to
perish
their
hatred
against
robur
and
his
people
had
so
increased
that
they
would
sacrifice
their
own
lives
to
destroy
the
albatross
and
all
she
bore
the
act
was
that
of
madmen
it
was
horrible
but
at
such
a
pitch
had
they
arrived
after
five
weeks
of
anger
that
could
not
vent
itself
of
rage
that
could
not
be
gratified
and
frycollin
asked
phil
evans
have
we
the
right
to
dispose
of
his
life
we
shall
sacrifice
ours
as
well
said
uncle
prudent
but
it
is
doubtful
if
frycollin
would
have
thought
the
reason
sufficient
immediately
uncle
prudent
set
to
work
while
evans
kept
watch
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
cabin
the
crew
were
all
at
work
forward
there
was
no
fear
of
being
surprised
uncle
prudent
began
by
rubbing
a
small
quantity
of
the
powder
very
fine
and
then
having
slightly
moistened
it
he
wrapped
it
up
in
a
piece
of
rag
in
the
shape
of
a
match
when
it
was
lighted
he
calculated
it
would
burn
about
an
inch
in
five
minutes
or
a
yard
in
three
hours
the
match
was
tried
and
found
to
answer
and
was
then
wound
round
with
string
and
attached
to
the
cap
of
the
cartridge
uncle
prudent
had
all
finished
about
ten
in
the
evening
without
having
excited
the
least
suspicion
during
the
day
the
work
on
the
fore
screw
had
been
actively
carried
on
but
it
had
had
to
be
taken
on
board
to
adjust
the
twisted
blades
of
the
piles
and
accumulators
and
the
machinery
that
drove
the
ship
nothing
was
damaged
when
night
fell
robur
and
his
men
knocked
off
work
the
fore
propeller
not
been
got
into
place
and
to
finish
it
would
take
another
three
hours
after
some
conversation
with
tom
turner
it
was
decided
to
give
the
crew
a
rest
and
postpone
what
required
to
be
done
to
the
next
morning
the
final
adjustment
was
a
matter
of
extreme
nicety
and
the
electric
lamps
did
not
give
so
suitable
a
light
for
such
work
as
the
daylight
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
were
not
aware
of
this
they
had
understood
that
the
screw
would
be
in
place
during
the
night
and
that
the
albatross
would
be
on
her
way
to
the
north
the
night
was
dark
and
moonless
heavy
clouds
made
the
darkness
deeper
a
light
breeze
began
to
rise
a
few
puffs
came
from
the
southwest
but
they
had
no
effect
on
the
albatross
she
remained
motionless
at
her
anchor
and
the
cable
stretched
vertically
downward
to
the
ground
uncle
prudent
and
his
colleague
imagining
they
were
under
way
again
sat
shut
up
in
their
cabin
exchanging
but
a
few
words
and
listening
to
the
of
the
suspensory
screws
which
drowned
every
other
sound
on
board
they
were
waiting
till
the
time
of
action
arrived
a
little
before
midnight
uncle
prudent
said
it
is
time
under
the
berths
in
the
cabin
was
a
sliding
box
forming
a
small
locker
and
in
this
locker
uncle
prudent
put
the
dynamite
and
the
in
this
way
the
match
would
burn
without
betraying
itself
by
its
smoke
or
spluttering
uncle
prudent
lighted
the
end
and
pushed
back
the
box
under
the
berth
with
now
let
us
go
aft
and
wait
they
then
went
out
and
were
astonished
not
to
find
the
steersman
at
his
post
phil
evans
leant
out
over
the
rail
the
albatross
is
where
she
was
said
he
in
a
low
voice
the
work
is
not
finished
they
have
not
started
uncle
prudent
made
a
gesture
of
disappointment
we
shall
have
to
put
out
the
match
said
he
no
said
phil
evans
we
must
escape
escape
yes
down
the
cable
fifty
yards
is
nothing
nothing
of
course
phil
evans
and
we
should
be
fools
not
to
take
the
chance
now
it
has
come
but
first
they
went
back
to
the
cabin
and
took
away
all
they
could
carry
with
a
view
to
a
more
or
less
prolonged
stay
on
the
chatham
islands
then
they
shut
the
door
and
noiselessly
crept
forward
intending
to
wake
frycollin
and
take
him
with
them
the
darkness
was
intense
the
clouds
were
racing
up
from
the
southwest
and
the
aeronef
was
tugging
at
her
anchor
and
thus
throwing
the
cable
more
and
more
out
of
the
vertical
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
slipping
down
it
the
colleagues
made
their
way
along
the
deck
stopping
in
the
shadow
of
the
deckhouses
to
listen
if
there
was
any
sound
the
silence
was
unbroken
no
light
shone
from
the
portholes
the
aeronef
was
not
only
silent
she
was
asleep
uncle
prudent
was
close
to
frycollin
cabin
when
phil
evans
stopped
him
the
he
said
a
man
was
crouching
near
the
he
was
only
half
asleep
all
flight
would
be
impossible
if
he
were
to
give
the
alarm
close
by
were
a
few
ropes
and
pieces
of
rag
and
waste
used
in
the
work
at
the
screw
an
instant
afterwards
the
man
was
gagged
and
blindfolded
and
lashed
to
the
rail
unable
to
utter
a
sound
or
move
an
inch
this
was
done
almost
without
a
whisper
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
listened
all
was
silent
within
the
cabins
every
one
on
board
was
asleep
they
reached
cabin
tapage
was
snoring
away
in
a
style
worthy
of
his
name
and
that
promised
well
to
his
great
surprise
uncle
prudent
had
not
even
to
push
door
it
was
open
he
stepped
into
the
doorway
and
looked
around
nobody
here
he
said
nobody
where
can
he
be
asked
phil
evans
they
went
into
the
bow
thinking
frycollin
might
perhaps
be
asleep
in
the
corner
still
they
found
nobody
has
the
fellow
got
the
start
of
us
asked
uncle
prudent
whether
he
has
or
not
said
phil
evans
we
ca
wait
any
longer
down
you
go
without
hesitation
the
fugitives
one
after
the
other
clambered
over
the
side
and
seizing
the
cable
with
hands
and
feet
slipped
down
it
safe
and
sound
to
the
ground
think
of
their
joy
at
again
treading
the
earth
they
had
lost
for
so
long
at
walking
on
solid
ground
and
being
no
longer
the
playthings
of
the
atmosphere
they
were
staring
up
the
creek
to
the
interior
of
the
island
when
suddenly
a
form
rose
in
front
of
them
it
was
frycollin
the
negro
had
had
the
same
idea
as
his
master
and
the
audacity
to
start
without
telling
him
but
there
was
no
time
for
recriminations
and
uncle
prudent
was
in
search
of
a
refuge
in
some
distant
part
of
the
island
when
phil
evans
stopped
him
uncle
prudent
said
he
here
we
are
safe
from
robur
he
is
doomed
like
his
companions
to
a
terrible
death
he
deserves
it
we
know
but
if
he
would
swear
on
his
honor
not
to
take
us
prisoners
again
the
honor
of
such
a
man
uncle
prudent
did
not
finish
his
sentence
there
was
a
noise
on
the
albatross
evidently
the
alarm
had
been
given
the
escape
was
discovered
help
help
shouted
somebody
it
was
the
man
who
had
got
rid
of
his
gag
hurried
footsteps
were
heard
on
deck
almost
immediately
the
electric
lamps
shot
beams
over
a
large
circle
there
they
are
there
they
are
shouted
tom
turner
the
fugitives
were
seen
at
the
same
instant
an
order
was
given
by
robur
and
the
suspensory
screws
being
slowed
the
cable
was
hauled
in
on
board
and
the
albatross
sank
towards
the
ground
at
this
moment
the
voice
of
phil
evans
was
heard
shouting
engineer
robur
will
you
give
us
your
word
of
honor
to
leave
us
free
on
this
island
never
said
robur
and
the
reply
was
followed
by
the
report
of
a
gun
and
the
bullet
grazed
phil
shoulder
ah
the
brutes
said
uncle
prudent
knife
in
hand
he
rushed
towards
the
rocks
where
the
anchor
had
fixed
itself
the
aeronef
was
not
more
than
fifty
feet
from
the
ground
in
a
few
seconds
the
cable
was
cut
and
the
breeze
which
had
increased
considerably
striking
the
albatross
on
the
quarter
carried
her
out
over
the
sea
chapter
xx
the
wreck
of
the
albatross
it
was
then
twenty
minutes
after
midnight
five
or
six
shots
had
been
fired
from
the
aeronef
uncle
prudent
and
frycollin
supporting
phil
evans
had
taken
shelter
among
the
rocks
they
had
not
been
hit
for
the
moment
there
was
nothing
to
fear
as
the
albatross
drifted
off
from
pitt
island
she
rose
obliquely
to
nearly
three
thousand
feet
it
was
necessary
to
increase
the
ascensional
power
to
prevent
her
falling
into
the
sea
when
the
man
had
got
clear
of
his
gag
and
shouted
robur
and
tom
turner
had
rushed
up
to
him
and
torn
off
his
bandage
the
mate
had
then
run
back
to
the
stern
cabin
it
was
empty
tapage
had
searched
frycollin
cabin
and
that
also
was
empty
when
he
saw
that
the
prisoners
had
escaped
robur
was
seized
with
a
paroxysm
of
anger
the
escape
meant
the
revelation
of
his
secret
to
the
world
he
had
not
been
much
concerned
at
the
document
thrown
overboard
while
they
were
crossing
europe
for
there
were
so
many
chances
that
it
would
be
lost
in
its
fall
but
now
as
he
grew
calm
they
have
escaped
said
he
be
it
so
but
they
can
not
get
away
from
pitt
island
and
in
a
day
or
so
i
will
go
back
i
will
recapture
them
and
then
in
fact
the
safety
of
the
three
fugitives
was
by
no
means
assured
the
albatross
would
be
repaired
and
return
well
in
hand
before
the
day
was
out
they
might
again
be
in
the
power
of
the
engineer
before
the
day
was
out
but
in
two
hours
the
albatross
would
be
annihilated
the
dynamite
cartridge
was
like
a
torpedo
fastened
to
her
hull
and
would
accomplish
her
destruction
in
the
breeze
freshened
and
the
aeronef
was
carried
to
the
northeast
although
her
speed
was
but
moderate
she
would
be
out
of
sight
of
the
chatham
islands
before
sunrise
to
return
against
the
wind
she
must
have
her
propellers
going
particularly
the
one
in
the
bow
tom
said
the
engineer
turn
the
lights
full
on
yes
sir
and
all
hands
to
work
yes
sir
there
was
no
longer
any
idea
of
putting
off
the
work
till
tomorrow
there
was
now
no
thought
of
fatigue
not
one
of
the
men
of
the
albatross
failed
to
share
in
the
feelings
of
his
chief
not
one
but
was
ready
to
do
anything
to
recapture
the
fugitives
as
soon
as
the
screw
was
in
place
they
would
return
to
the
island
and
drop
another
anchor
and
give
chase
to
the
fugitives
then
only
would
they
begin
repairing
the
and
then
the
aeronef
could
resume
her
voyage
across
the
pacific
to
x
island
it
was
important
above
all
things
that
the
albatross
should
not
be
carried
too
far
to
the
northeast
but
unfortunately
the
breeze
grew
stronger
and
she
could
not
head
against
it
or
even
remain
stationary
deprived
of
her
propellers
she
was
an
unguidable
balloon
the
fugitives
on
the
shore
knew
that
she
would
have
disappeared
before
the
explosion
blew
her
to
pieces
robur
felt
much
disappointment
at
seeing
his
plans
so
interfered
with
would
it
not
take
him
much
longer
than
he
thought
to
get
back
to
his
old
anchorage
while
the
work
at
the
screw
was
actively
pushed
on
he
resolved
to
descend
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
in
the
hope
that
the
wind
would
there
be
lighter
perhaps
the
albatross
would
be
able
to
remain
in
the
neighborhood
until
she
was
again
fit
to
work
to
windward
the
maneuver
was
instantly
executed
if
a
passing
ship
had
sighted
the
aerial
machine
as
she
sunk
through
the
air
with
her
electric
lights
in
full
blaze
with
what
terror
would
she
have
been
seized
when
the
albatross
was
a
few
hundred
feet
from
the
waves
she
stopped
unfortunately
robur
found
that
the
breeze
was
stronger
here
than
above
and
the
aeronef
drifted
off
more
rapidly
he
risked
being
blown
a
long
way
off
to
the
northeast
and
that
would
delay
his
return
to
pitt
island
in
short
after
several
experiments
he
found
it
better
to
keep
his
ship
well
up
in
the
air
and
the
albatross
went
aloft
to
about
ten
thousand
feet
there
if
she
did
not
remain
stationary
the
drifting
was
very
slight
the
engineer
could
thus
hope
that
by
sunrise
at
such
an
altitude
he
would
still
be
in
sight
of
the
island
robur
did
not
trouble
himself
about
the
reception
the
fugitives
might
have
received
from
the
natives
if
there
were
any
natives
that
they
might
help
them
mattered
little
to
him
with
the
powers
of
offense
possessed
by
the
albatross
they
would
be
promptly
terrified
and
dispersed
the
capture
of
the
prisoners
was
certain
and
once
he
had
them
again
they
will
not
escape
from
x
island
about
one
in
the
morning
the
was
finished
and
all
that
had
to
be
done
was
to
get
it
back
to
its
place
this
would
take
about
an
hour
that
done
the
albatross
would
be
headed
southwest
and
the
could
be
taken
in
hand
and
how
about
the
match
that
was
burning
in
the
deserted
cabin
the
match
of
which
more
than
a
third
was
now
consumed
and
the
spark
that
was
creeping
along
to
the
dynamite
assuredly
if
the
men
of
the
aeronef
had
not
been
so
busy
one
of
them
would
have
heard
the
feeble
sputtering
that
was
going
on
in
the
perhaps
he
would
have
smelt
the
burning
powder
he
would
doubtless
have
become
uneasy
and
told
tom
turner
and
then
they
would
have
looked
about
and
found
the
box
and
the
infernal
machine
and
then
there
would
have
been
time
to
save
this
wonderful
albatross
and
all
she
bore
but
the
men
were
at
work
in
the
bow
twenty
yards
away
from
the
cabin
nothing
brought
them
to
that
part
of
the
deck
nothing
called
off
their
attention
from
their
work
robur
was
there
working
with
his
hands
excellent
mechanic
as
he
was
he
hurried
on
the
work
but
nothing
was
neglected
everything
was
carefully
done
was
it
not
necessary
that
he
should
again
become
absolute
master
of
his
invention
if
he
did
not
recapture
the
fugitives
they
would
get
away
home
they
would
begin
inquiring
into
matters
they
might
even
discover
x
island
and
there
would
be
an
end
to
this
life
which
the
men
of
the
albatross
had
created
for
themselves
a
life
that
seemed
superhuman
and
sublime
tom
turner
came
up
to
the
engineer
it
was
a
quarter
past
one
it
seems
to
me
sir
that
the
breeze
is
falling
and
going
round
to
the
west
what
does
the
barometer
say
asked
robur
after
looking
up
at
the
sky
it
is
almost
stationary
and
the
clouds
seem
gathering
below
us
so
they
are
and
it
may
be
raining
down
at
the
sea
but
if
we
keep
above
the
rain
it
makes
no
difference
to
us
it
will
not
interfere
with
the
work
if
it
is
raining
it
is
not
a
heavy
rain
said
tom
the
clouds
do
not
look
like
it
and
probably
the
wind
has
dropped
altogether
perhaps
so
but
i
think
we
had
better
not
go
down
yet
let
us
get
into
going
order
as
soon
as
we
can
and
then
we
can
do
as
we
like
at
a
few
minutes
after
two
the
first
part
of
the
work
was
finished
the
was
in
its
place
and
the
power
was
turned
on
the
speed
was
gradually
increased
and
the
albatross
heading
to
the
southwest
returned
at
moderate
speed
towards
the
chatham
islands
tom
said
robur
it
is
about
two
hours
and
a
half
since
we
got
adrift
the
wind
has
not
changed
all
the
time
i
think
we
ought
to
be
over
the
island
in
an
hour
yes
sir
we
are
going
about
forty
feet
a
second
we
ought
to
be
there
about
three
all
the
better
it
would
suit
us
best
to
get
back
while
it
is
dark
and
even
beach
the
albatross
if
we
can
those
fellows
will
fancy
we
are
a
long
way
off
to
the
northward
and
never
think
of
keeping
a
if
we
have
to
stop
a
day
or
two
on
the
island
we
stop
and
if
we
have
to
fight
an
army
of
natives
we
fight
said
robur
we
fight
then
for
our
albatross
the
engineer
went
forward
to
the
men
who
were
waiting
for
orders
my
lads
he
said
to
them
we
can
not
knock
off
yet
we
must
work
till
day
comes
they
were
all
ready
to
do
so
the
had
now
to
be
treated
as
the
other
had
been
the
damage
was
the
same
a
twisting
from
the
violence
of
the
hurricane
during
the
passage
across
the
southern
pole
but
to
get
the
screw
on
board
it
seemed
best
to
stop
the
progress
of
the
aeronef
for
a
few
minutes
and
even
to
drive
her
backwards
the
engines
were
reversed
the
aeronef
began
to
fall
astern
when
tom
turner
was
surprised
by
a
peculiar
odor
this
was
from
the
gas
given
off
by
the
match
which
had
accumulated
in
the
box
and
was
now
escaping
from
the
cabin
hallo
said
the
mate
with
a
sniff
what
is
the
matter
asked
robur
do
you
smell
something
is
it
burning
powder
so
it
is
tom
and
it
comes
from
that
cabin
yes
the
very
cabin
have
those
scoundrels
set
it
on
fire
suppose
it
is
something
else
exclaimed
robur
force
the
door
tom
drive
in
the
door
but
the
mate
had
not
made
one
step
towards
it
when
a
fearful
explosion
shook
the
albatross
the
cabins
flew
into
splinters
the
lamps
went
out
the
electric
current
suddenly
failed
the
darkness
was
complete
most
of
the
suspensory
screws
were
twisted
or
broken
but
a
few
in
the
bow
still
revolved
at
the
same
instant
the
hull
of
the
aeronef
opened
just
behind
the
first
where
the
engines
for
the
were
placed
and
the
of
the
deck
collapsed
in
space
immediately
the
last
suspensory
screw
stopped
spinning
and
the
albatross
dropped
into
the
abyss
it
was
a
fall
of
ten
thousand
feet
for
the
eight
men
who
were
clinging
to
the
wreck
and
the
fall
was
even
faster
than
it
might
have
been
for
the
fore
propeller
was
vertical
in
the
air
and
still
working
it
was
then
that
robur
with
extraordinary
coolness
climbed
up
to
the
broken
and
seizing
the
lever
reversed
the
rotation
so
that
the
propeller
became
a
suspender
the
fall
continued
but
it
was
checked
and
the
wreck
did
not
fall
with
the
accelerating
swiftness
of
bodies
influenced
solely
by
gravitation
and
if
it
was
death
to
the
survivors
of
the
albatross
from
their
being
hurled
into
the
sea
it
was
not
death
by
asphyxia
amid
air
which
the
rapidity
of
descent
rendered
unbreathable
eighty
seconds
after
the
explosion
all
that
remained
of
the
albatross
plunged
into
the
waves
chapter

the
institute
again
some
weeks
before
on
the
of
june
on
the
morning
after
the
sitting
during
which
the
weldon
institute
had
been
given
over
to
such
stormy
discussions
the
excitement
of
all
classes
of
the
philadelphia
population
black
or
white
had
been
much
easier
to
imagine
than
to
describe
from
a
very
early
hour
conversation
was
entirely
occupied
with
the
unexpected
and
scandalous
incident
of
the
night
before
a
stranger
calling
himself
an
engineer
and
answering
to
the
name
of
robur
a
person
of
unknown
origin
of
anonymous
nationality
had
unexpectedly
presented
himself
in
the
insulted
the
balloonists
made
fun
of
the
aeronauts
boasted
of
the
marvels
of
machines
heavier
than
air
and
raised
a
frightful
tumult
by
the
remarks
with
which
he
greeted
the
menaces
of
his
adversaries
after
leaving
the
desk
amid
a
volley
of
revolver
shots
he
had
disappeared
and
in
spite
of
every
endeavor
no
trace
could
be
found
of
him
assuredly
here
was
enough
to
exercise
every
tongue
and
excite
every
imagination
but
by
how
much
was
this
excitement
increased
when
in
the
evening
of
the
of
june
it
was
found
that
neither
the
president
nor
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
had
returned
to
their
homes
was
it
by
chance
only
that
they
were
absent
no
or
at
least
there
was
nothing
to
lead
people
to
think
so
it
had
even
been
agreed
that
in
the
morning
they
would
be
back
at
the
club
one
as
president
the
other
as
secretary
to
take
their
places
during
a
discussion
on
the
events
of
the
preceding
evening
and
not
only
was
there
the
complete
disappearance
of
these
two
considerable
personages
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
but
there
was
no
news
of
the
valet
frycollin
he
was
as
undiscoverable
as
his
master
never
had
a
negro
since
toussaint
soulouque
or
dessaline
had
so
much
talked
about
him
the
next
day
there
was
no
news
neither
the
colleagues
nor
frycollin
had
been
found
the
anxiety
became
serious
agitation
commenced
a
numerous
crowd
besieged
the
post
and
telegraph
offices
in
case
any
news
should
be
received
there
was
no
news
and
they
had
been
seen
coming
out
of
the
weldon
institute
loudly
talking
together
and
with
frycollin
in
attendance
go
down
walnut
street
towards
fairmount
park
jem
chip
the
vegetarian
had
even
shaken
hands
with
the
president
and
left
him
with
tomorrow
and
william
forbes
the
manufacturer
of
sugar
from
rags
had
received
a
cordial
shake
from
phil
evans
who
had
said
to
him
twice
au
revoir
au
revoir
miss
doll
and
miss
mat
forbes
so
attached
to
uncle
prudent
by
the
bonds
of
purest
friendship
could
not
get
over
the
disappearance
and
in
order
to
obtain
news
of
the
absent
talked
even
more
than
they
were
accustomed
to
three
four
five
six
days
passed
then
a
week
then
two
weeks
and
there
was
nothing
to
give
a
clue
to
the
missing
three
the
most
minute
search
had
been
made
in
every
quarter
nothing
in
the
park
even
under
the
trees
and
brushwood
nothing
always
nothing
although
here
it
was
noticed
that
the
grass
looked
to
be
pressed
down
in
a
way
that
seemed
suspicious
and
certainly
was
inexplicable
and
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
there
were
traces
of
a
recent
struggle
perhaps
a
band
of
scoundrels
had
attacked
the
colleagues
here
in
the
deserted
park
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
was
possible
the
police
proceeded
with
their
inquiries
in
all
due
form
and
with
all
lawful
slowness
they
dragged
the
schuyllkill
river
and
cut
into
the
thick
bushes
that
fringe
its
banks
and
if
this
was
useless
it
was
not
quite
a
waste
for
the
schuyllkill
is
in
great
want
of
a
good
weeding
and
it
got
it
on
this
occasion
practical
people
are
the
authorities
of
philadelphia
then
the
newspapers
were
tried
advertisements
and
notices
and
articles
were
sent
to
all
the
journals
in
the
union
without
distinction
of
color
the
daily
negro
the
special
organ
of
the
black
race
published
a
portrait
of
frycollin
after
his
latest
photograph
rewards
were
offered
to
whoever
would
give
news
of
the
three
absentees
and
even
to
those
who
would
find
some
clue
to
put
the
police
on
the
track
five
thousand
dollars
five
thousand
dollars
to
any
citizen
who
would
nothing
was
done
the
five
thousand
dollars
remained
with
the
treasurer
of
the
weldon
institute
undiscoverable
undiscoverable
undiscoverable
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
of
philadelphia
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
the
club
was
put
to
serious
inconvenience
by
this
disappearance
of
its
president
and
secretary
and
at
first
the
assembly
voted
urgency
to
a
measure
which
suspended
the
work
on
the
how
in
the
absence
of
the
principal
promoters
of
the
affair
of
those
who
had
devoted
to
the
enterprise
a
certain
part
of
their
fortune
in
time
and
money
how
could
they
finish
the
work
when
these
were
not
present
it
were
better
then
to
wait
and
just
then
came
the
first
news
of
the
strange
phenomenon
which
had
exercised
people
minds
some
weeks
before
the
mysterious
object
had
been
again
seen
at
different
times
in
the
higher
regions
of
the
atmosphere
but
nobody
dreamt
of
establishing
a
connection
between
this
singular
reappearance
and
the
no
less
singular
disappearance
of
the
members
of
the
weldon
institute
in
fact
it
would
have
required
a
very
strong
dose
of
imagination
to
connect
one
of
these
facts
with
the
other
whatever
it
might
be
asteroid
or
aerolite
or
aerial
monster
it
had
reappeared
in
such
a
way
that
its
dimensions
and
shape
could
be
much
better
appreciated
first
in
canada
over
the
country
between
ottawa
and
quebec
on
the
very
morning
after
the
disappearance
of
the
colleagues
and
later
over
the
plains
of
the
far
west
where
it
had
tried
its
speed
against
an
express
train
on
the
union
pacific
at
the
end
of
this
day
the
doubts
of
the
learned
world
were
at
an
end
the
body
was
not
a
product
of
nature
it
was
a
flying
machine
the
practical
application
of
the
theory
of
heavier
than
air
and
if
the
inventor
of
the
aeronef
had
wished
to
keep
himself
unknown
he
could
evidently
have
done
better
than
to
try
it
over
the
far
west
as
to
the
mechanical
force
he
required
or
the
engines
by
which
it
was
communicated
nothing
was
known
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
the
aeronef
was
gifted
with
an
extraordinary
faculty
of
locomotion
in
fact
a
few
days
afterwards
it
was
reported
from
the
celestial
empire
then
from
the
southern
part
of
india
then
from
the
russian
steppes
who
was
then
this
bold
mechanician
that
possessed
such
powers
of
locomotion
for
whom
states
had
no
frontiers
and
oceans
no
limits
who
disposed
of
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
as
if
it
were
his
domain
could
it
be
this
robur
whose
theories
had
been
so
brutally
thrown
in
the
face
of
the
weldon
institute
the
day
he
led
the
attack
against
the
utopia
of
guidable
balloons
perhaps
such
a
notion
occurred
to
some
of
the
people
but
none
dreamt
that
the
said
robur
had
anything
to
do
with
the
disappearance
of
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
institute
things
remained
in
this
state
of
mystery
when
a
telegram
arrived
from
france
through
the
new
york
cable
at
on
july
and
what
was
this
telegram
it
was
the
text
of
the
document
found
at
paris
in
a
revealing
what
had
happened
to
the
two
personages
for
whom
the
union
was
in
mourning
so
then
the
perpetrator
of
this
kidnapping
was
robur
the
engineer
come
expressly
to
philadelphia
to
destroy
in
its
egg
the
theory
of
the
balloonists
he
it
was
who
commanded
the
albatross
he
it
was
who
carried
off
by
way
of
reprisal
uncle
prudent
phil
evans
and
frycollin
and
they
might
be
considered
lost
for
ever
at
least
until
some
means
were
found
of
constructing
an
engine
capable
of
contending
with
this
powerful
machine
their
terrestrial
friends
would
never
bring
them
back
to
earth
what
excitement
what
stupor
the
telegram
from
paris
had
been
addressed
to
the
members
of
the
weldon
institute
the
members
of
the
club
were
immediately
informed
of
it
ten
minutes
later
all
philadelphia
received
the
news
through
its
telephones
and
in
less
than
an
hour
all
america
heard
of
it
through
the
innumerable
electric
wires
of
the
new
continent
no
one
would
believe
it
it
is
an
unseasonable
joke
said
some
it
is
all
smoke
said
others
how
could
such
a
thing
be
done
in
philadelphia
and
so
secretly
too
how
could
the
albatross
have
been
beached
in
fairmount
park
without
its
appearance
having
been
signaled
all
over
pennsylvania
very
good
these
were
the
arguments
the
incredulous
had
the
right
of
doubting
but
the
right
did
not
last
long
seven
days
after
the
receipt
of
the
telegram
the
french
normandie
came
into
the
hudson
bringing
the
famous
the
railway
took
it
in
all
haste
from
new
york
to
philadelphia
it
was
indeed
the
of
the
president
of
the
weldon
institute
jem
chip
would
have
done
on
at
day
to
take
some
more
substantial
nourishment
for
he
fell
into
a
swoon
when
he
recognized
it
how
many
a
time
had
he
taken
from
it
the
pinch
of
friendship
and
miss
doll
and
miss
mat
also
recognized
it
and
so
did
william
forbes
truck
milnor
bat
fynn
and
many
other
members
and
not
only
was
it
the
president
it
was
the
president
writing
then
did
the
people
lament
and
stretch
out
their
hands
in
despair
to
the
skies
uncle
prudent
and
his
colleague
carried
away
in
a
flying
machine
and
no
one
able
to
deliver
them
the
niagara
falls
company
in
which
uncle
prudent
was
the
largest
shareholder
thought
of
suspending
its
business
and
turning
off
its
cataracts
the
wheelton
watch
company
thought
of
winding
up
its
machinery
now
it
had
lost
its
manager
nothing
more
was
heard
of
the
aeronef
july
passed
and
there
was
no
news
august
ran
its
course
and
the
uncertainty
on
the
subject
of
robur
prisoners
was
as
great
as
ever
had
he
like
icarus
fallen
a
victim
to
his
own
temerity
the
first
days
of
september
went
by
without
result
but
on
the
a
rumor
spread
through
philadelphia
that
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
had
during
the
afternoon
quietly
walked
into
the
president
house
and
what
was
more
extraordinary
the
rumor
was
true
although
very
few
believed
it
they
had
however
to
give
in
to
the
evidence
there
could
be
no
doubt
these
were
the
two
men
and
not
their
shadows
and
frycollin
also
had
come
back
the
members
of
the
club
then
their
friends
then
the
crowd
swarmed
into
the
president
house
and
shook
hands
with
the
president
and
secretary
and
cheered
them
again
and
again
jem
chip
was
there
having
left
his
luncheon
joint
of
boiled
lettuces
and
william
forbes
and
his
daughters
and
all
the
members
of
the
club
it
is
a
mystery
how
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
emerged
alive
from
the
thousands
who
welcomed
them
on
that
evening
was
the
weekly
meeting
of
the
institute
it
was
expected
that
the
colleagues
would
take
their
places
at
the
desk
as
they
had
said
nothing
of
their
adventures
it
was
thought
they
would
then
speak
and
relate
the
impressions
of
their
voyage
but
for
some
reason
or
other
both
were
silent
and
so
also
was
frycollin
whom
his
congeners
in
their
delirium
had
failed
to
dismember
but
though
the
colleagues
did
not
tell
what
had
happened
to
them
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
we
know
what
occurred
on
the
night
of
the
and
of
july
the
daring
escape
to
the
earth
the
scramble
among
the
rocks
the
bullet
fired
at
phil
evans
the
cut
cable
and
the
albatross
deprived
of
her
propellers
drifting
off
to
the
northeast
at
a
great
altitude
her
electric
lamps
rendered
her
visible
for
some
time
and
then
she
disappeared
the
fugitives
had
little
to
fear
now
could
robur
get
back
to
the
island
for
three
or
four
hours
if
his
screws
were
out
of
gear
by
that
time
the
albatross
would
have
been
destroyed
by
the
explosion
and
be
no
more
than
a
wreck
floating
on
the
sea
those
whom
she
bore
would
be
mangled
corpses
which
the
ocean
would
not
even
give
up
again
the
act
of
vengeance
would
be
accomplished
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
looked
upon
it
as
an
act
of
legitimate
and
felt
no
remorse
whatever
evans
was
but
slightly
wounded
by
the
rifle
bullet
and
the
three
made
their
way
up
from
the
shore
in
the
hope
of
meeting
some
of
the
natives
the
hope
was
realized
about
fifty
natives
were
living
by
fishing
off
the
western
coast
they
had
seen
the
aeronef
descend
on
the
island
and
they
welcomed
the
fugitives
as
if
they
were
supernatural
beings
they
worshipped
them
we
ought
rather
to
say
they
accommodated
them
in
the
most
comfortable
of
their
huts
as
they
had
expected
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
saw
nothing
more
of
the
aeronef
they
concluded
that
the
catastrophe
had
taken
place
in
some
high
region
of
the
atmosphere
and
that
they
would
hear
no
more
of
robur
and
his
prodigious
machine
meanwhile
they
had
to
wait
for
an
opportunity
of
returning
to
america
the
chatham
islands
are
not
much
visited
by
navigators
and
all
august
passed
without
sign
of
a
ship
the
fugitives
began
to
ask
themselves
if
they
had
not
exchanged
one
prison
for
another
at
last
a
ship
came
to
water
at
the
chatham
islands
it
will
not
have
been
forgotten
that
when
uncle
prudent
was
seized
he
had
on
him
several
thousand
paper
dollars
much
more
than
would
take
him
back
to
america
after
thanking
their
adorers
who
were
not
sparing
of
their
most
respectful
demonstrations
uncle
prudent
phil
evans
and
frycollin
embarked
for
auckland
they
said
nothing
of
their
adventures
and
in
two
weeks
landed
in
new
zealand
at
auckland
a
took
them
on
board
as
passengers
and
after
a
splendid
passage
the
survivors
of
the
albatross
stepped
ashore
at
san
francisco
they
said
nothing
as
to
who
they
were
or
whence
they
had
come
but
as
they
had
paid
full
price
for
their
berths
no
american
captain
would
trouble
them
further
at
san
francisco
they
took
the
first
train
out
on
the
pacific
railway
and
on
the
of
september
they
arrived
at
philadelphia
that
is
the
compendious
history
of
what
had
occurred
since
the
escape
of
the
fugitives
and
that
is
why
this
very
evening
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
took
their
seats
amid
a
most
extraordinary
attendance
never
before
had
either
of
them
been
so
calm
to
look
at
them
it
did
not
seem
as
though
anything
abnormal
had
happened
since
the
memorable
sitting
of
the
of
june
three
months
and
a
half
had
gone
and
seemed
to
be
counted
as
nothing
after
the
first
round
of
cheers
which
both
received
without
showing
the
slightest
emotion
uncle
prudent
took
off
his
hat
and
spoke
worthy
citizens
said
he
the
meeting
is
now
open
tremendous
applause
and
properly
so
for
if
it
was
not
extraordinary
that
the
meeting
was
open
it
was
extraordinary
that
it
should
be
opened
by
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
the
president
allowed
the
enthusiasm
to
subside
in
shouts
and
clappings
then
he
continued
at
our
last
meeting
gentlemen
the
discussion
was
somewhat
animated
hear
hear
between
the
partisans
of
the
screw
before
and
those
of
the
screw
behind
for
our
balloon
the
marks
of
surprise
we
have
found
a
way
to
bring
the
beforists
and
the
behindists
in
agreement
that
way
is
as
follows
we
are
going
to
use
two
screws
one
at
each
end
of
the
car
silence
and
complete
stupefaction
that
was
all
yes
all
of
the
kidnapping
of
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
not
a
word
not
a
word
of
the
albatross
nor
of
robur
not
a
word
of
the
voyage
not
a
word
of
the
way
in
which
the
prisoners
had
escaped
not
a
word
of
what
had
become
of
the
aeronef
if
it
still
flew
through
space
or
if
they
were
to
be
prepared
for
new
reprisals
on
the
member
of
the
club
of
course
the
balloonists
were
longing
to
ask
uncle
prudent
and
the
secretary
about
all
these
things
but
they
looked
so
close
and
so
serious
that
they
thought
it
best
to
respect
their
attitude
when
they
thought
fit
to
speak
they
would
do
so
and
it
would
be
an
honor
to
hear
after
all
there
might
be
in
all
this
some
secret
which
would
not
yet
be
divulged
and
then
uncle
prudent
resuming
his
speech
amid
a
silence
up
to
then
unknown
in
the
meetings
of
the
weldon
institute
said
gentlemen
it
now
only
remains
for
us
to
finish
the
aerostat
it
is
left
to
her
to
effect
the
conquest
of
the
air
the
meeting
is
at
an
end
chapter
xxii
the
is
launched
on
the
following
of
april
seven
months
after
the
unexpected
return
of
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
philadelphia
was
in
a
state
of
unwonted
excitement
there
were
neither
elections
nor
meetings
this
time
the
aerostat
built
by
the
weldon
institute
was
to
take
possession
of
her
natural
element
the
celebrated
harry
tinder
whose
name
we
mentioned
at
the
beginning
of
this
story
had
been
engaged
as
aeronaut
he
had
no
assistant
and
the
only
passengers
were
to
be
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
did
they
not
merit
such
an
honor
did
it
not
come
to
them
appropriately
to
rise
in
person
to
protest
against
any
apparatus
that
was
heavier
than
air
during
the
seven
months
however
they
had
said
nothing
of
their
adventures
and
even
frycollin
had
not
uttered
a
whisper
of
robur
and
his
wonderful
clipper
probably
uncle
prudent
and
his
friend
desired
that
no
question
should
arise
as
to
the
merits
of
the
aeronef
or
any
other
flying
machine
although
the
might
not
claim
the
first
place
among
aerial
locomotives
they
would
have
nothing
to
say
about
the
inventions
of
other
aviators
they
believed
and
would
always
believe
that
the
true
atmospheric
vehicle
was
the
aerostat
and
that
to
it
alone
belonged
the
future
besides
he
on
whom
they
had
been
so
terribly
and
in
their
idea
so
justly
avenged
existed
no
longer
none
of
those
who
accompanied
him
had
survived
the
secret
of
the
albatross
was
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
pacific
that
robur
had
a
retreat
an
island
in
the
middle
of
that
vast
ocean
where
he
could
put
into
port
was
only
a
hypothesis
and
the
colleagues
reserved
to
themselves
the
right
of
making
inquiries
on
the
subject
later
on
the
grand
experiment
which
the
weldon
institute
had
been
preparing
for
so
long
was
at
last
to
take
place
the
was
the
most
perfect
type
of
what
had
up
to
then
been
invented
in
aerostatic
art
she
was
what
an
inflexible
or
a
formidable
is
in
ships
of
war
she
possessed
all
the
qualities
of
a
good
aerostat
her
dimensions
allowed
of
her
rising
to
the
greatest
height
a
balloon
could
attain
her
impermeability
enabled
her
to
remain
for
an
indefinite
time
in
the
atmosphere
her
solidity
would
defy
any
dilation
of
gas
or
violence
of
wind
or
rain
her
capacity
gave
her
sufficient
ascensional
force
to
lift
with
all
their
accessories
an
electric
engine
that
would
communicate
to
her
propellers
a
power
superior
to
anything
yet
obtained
the
was
of
elongated
form
so
as
to
facilitate
her
horizontal
displacement
her
car
was
a
platform
somewhat
like
that
of
the
balloon
used
by
krebs
and
renard
and
it
carried
all
the
necessary
outfit
instruments
cables
grapnels
and
the
piles
and
accumulators
for
the
mechanical
power
the
car
had
a
screw
in
front
and
a
screw
and
rudder
behind
but
probably
the
work
done
by
the
machines
would
be
very
much
less
than
that
done
by
the
machines
of
the
albatross
the
had
been
taken
to
the
clearing
in
fairmount
park
to
the
very
spot
where
the
aeronef
had
landed
for
a
few
hours
her
ascensional
power
was
due
to
the
very
lightest
of
gaseous
bodies
ordinary
lighting
gas
possesses
an
elevating
force
of
about
grams
for
every
cubic
meter
but
hydrogen
possesses
an
ascensional
force
estimated
at
grams
per
cubic
meter
pure
hydrogen
prepared
according
to
the
method
of
the
celebrated
henry
gifford
filled
the
enormous
balloon
and
as
the
capacity
of
the
was
cubic
meters
the
ascensional
power
of
the
gas
she
contained
was
multiplied
by
or
kilograms
on
this
of
april
everything
was
ready
since
eleven
the
enormous
aerostat
had
been
floating
a
few
feet
from
the
ground
ready
to
rise
in
it
was
splendid
weather
and
seemed
to
have
been
made
specially
for
the
experiment
although
if
the
breeze
had
been
stronger
the
results
might
have
been
more
conclusive
there
had
never
been
any
doubt
that
a
balloon
could
be
guided
in
a
calm
atmosphere
but
to
guide
it
when
the
atmosphere
is
in
motion
is
quite
another
thing
and
it
is
under
such
circumstances
that
the
experiment
should
be
tried
but
there
was
no
wind
today
nor
any
sign
of
any
strange
to
say
north
america
on
that
day
omitted
to
send
on
to
europe
one
of
those
storms
which
it
seems
to
have
in
such
inexhaustible
numbers
a
better
day
could
not
have
been
chosen
for
an
aeronautic
experiment
the
crowd
was
immense
in
fairmount
park
trains
had
poured
into
the
pennsylvania
capital
sightseers
from
the
neighboring
states
industrial
and
commercial
life
came
to
a
standstill
that
the
people
might
troop
to
the
workmen
women
old
men
children
members
of
congress
soldiers
magistrates
reporters
white
natives
and
black
natives
all
were
there
we
need
not
stop
to
describe
the
excitement
the
unaccountable
movements
the
sudden
pushings
which
made
the
mass
heave
and
swell
nor
need
we
recount
the
number
of
cheers
which
rose
from
all
sides
like
fireworks
when
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
appeared
on
the
platform
and
hoisted
the
american
colors
need
we
say
that
the
majority
of
the
crowd
had
come
from
afar
not
so
much
to
see
the
as
to
gaze
on
these
extraordinary
men
why
two
and
not
three
why
not
frycollin
because
frycollin
thought
his
campaign
in
the
albatross
sufficient
for
his
fame
he
had
declined
the
honor
of
accompanying
his
master
and
he
took
no
part
in
the
frenzied
declamations
that
greeted
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
of
the
members
of
the
illustrious
assembly
not
one
was
absent
from
the
reserved
places
within
the
ropes
there
were
truck
milnor
bat
fynn
and
william
forbes
with
his
two
daughters
on
his
arm
all
had
come
to
affirm
by
their
presence
that
nothing
could
separate
them
from
the
partisans
of
lighter
than
air
about
twenty
minutes
past
eleven
a
gun
announced
the
end
of
the
final
preparations
the
only
waited
the
signal
to
start
at
minutes
past
eleven
the
second
gun
was
fired
the
was
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
above
the
clearing
and
was
held
by
a
rope
in
this
way
the
platform
commanded
the
excited
crowd
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
stood
upright
and
placed
their
left
hands
on
their
hearts
to
signify
how
deeply
they
were
touched
by
their
reception
then
they
extended
their
right
hands
towards
the
zenith
to
signify
that
the
greatest
of
known
balloons
was
about
to
take
possession
of
the
domain
a
hundred
thousand
hands
were
placed
in
answer
on
a
hundred
thousand
hearts
and
a
hundred
thousand
other
hands
were
lifted
to
the
sky
the
third
gun
was
fired
at
eleven
let
go
shouted
uncle
prudent
and
the
rose
majestically
an
adverb
consecrated
by
custom
to
all
aerostatic
ascents
it
really
was
a
superb
spectacle
it
seemed
as
if
a
vessel
were
just
launched
from
the
stocks
and
was
she
not
a
vessel
launched
into
the
aerial
sea
the
went
up
in
a
perfectly
vertical
line
a
proof
of
the
calmness
of
the
atmosphere
and
stopped
at
an
altitude
of
eight
hundred
feet
then
she
began
her
horizontal
maneuvering
with
her
screws
going
she
moved
to
the
east
at
a
speed
of
twelve
yards
a
second
that
is
the
speed
of
the
whale
not
an
inappropriate
comparison
for
the
balloon
was
somewhat
of
the
shape
of
the
giant
of
the
northern
seas
a
salvo
of
cheers
mounted
towards
the
skillful
aeronauts
then
under
the
influence
of
her
rudder
the
went
through
all
the
evolutions
that
her
steersman
could
give
her
she
turned
in
a
small
circle
she
moved
forwards
and
backwards
in
a
way
to
convince
the
most
refractory
disbeliever
in
the
guiding
of
balloons
and
if
there
had
been
any
disbeliever
there
he
would
have
been
simply
annihilated
but
why
was
there
no
wind
to
assist
at
this
magnificent
experiment
it
was
regrettable
doubtless
the
spectators
would
have
seen
the
unhesitatingly
execute
all
the
movements
of
a
in
beating
to
windward
or
of
a
steamer
driving
in
the
wind
eye
at
this
moment
the
aerostat
rose
a
few
hundred
yards
the
maneuver
was
understood
below
uncle
prudent
and
his
companions
were
going
in
search
of
a
breeze
in
the
higher
zones
so
as
to
complete
the
experiment
the
system
of
cellular
balloons
analogous
to
the
swimming
bladder
in
fishes
into
which
could
be
introduced
a
certain
amount
of
air
by
pumping
had
provided
for
this
vertical
motion
without
throwing
out
ballast
or
losing
gas
the
aeronaut
was
able
to
rise
or
sink
at
his
will
of
course
there
was
a
valve
in
the
upper
hemisphere
which
would
permit
of
a
rapid
descent
if
found
necessary
all
these
contrivances
are
well
known
but
they
were
here
fitted
in
perfection
the
then
rose
vertically
her
enormous
dimensions
gradually
grew
smaller
to
the
eye
and
the
necks
of
the
crowd
were
almost
cricked
as
they
gazed
into
the
air
gradually
the
whale
became
a
porpoise
and
the
porpoise
became
a
gudgeon
the
ascensional
movement
did
not
cease
until
the
had
reached
a
height
of
fourteen
thousand
feet
but
the
air
was
so
free
from
mist
that
she
remained
clearly
visible
however
she
remained
over
the
clearing
as
if
she
were
a
fixture
an
immense
bell
had
imprisoned
the
atmosphere
and
deprived
it
of
movement
not
a
breath
of
wind
was
there
high
or
low
the
aerostat
maneuvered
without
encountering
any
resistance
seeming
very
small
owing
to
the
distance
much
as
if
she
were
being
looked
at
through
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
suddenly
there
was
a
shout
among
the
crowd
a
shout
followed
by
a
hundred
thousand
more
all
hands
were
stretched
towards
a
point
on
the
horizon
that
point
was
the
northwest
there
in
the
deep
azure
appeared
a
moving
body
which
was
approaching
and
growing
larger
was
it
a
bird
beating
with
its
wings
the
higher
zones
of
space
was
it
an
aerolite
shooting
obliquely
through
the
atmosphere
in
any
case
its
speed
was
terrific
and
it
would
soon
be
above
the
crowd
a
suspicion
communicated
itself
electrically
to
the
brains
of
all
on
the
clearing
but
it
seemed
as
though
the
had
sighted
this
strange
object
assuredly
it
seemed
as
though
she
feared
some
danger
for
her
speed
was
increased
and
she
was
going
east
as
fast
as
she
could
yes
the
crowd
saw
what
it
meant
a
name
uttered
by
one
of
the
members
of
the
weldon
institute
was
repeated
by
a
hundred
thousand
mouths
the
albatross
the
albatross
chapter
xxiii
the
grand
collapse
it
was
indeed
the
albatross
it
was
indeed
robur
who
had
reappeared
in
the
heights
of
the
sky
it
was
he
who
like
a
huge
bird
of
prey
was
going
to
strike
the
and
yet
nine
months
before
the
aeronef
shattered
by
the
explosion
her
screws
broken
her
deck
smashed
in
two
had
been
apparently
annihilated
without
the
prodigious
coolness
of
the
engineer
who
reversed
the
gyratory
motion
of
the
fore
propeller
and
converted
it
into
a
suspensory
screw
the
men
of
the
albatross
would
all
have
been
asphyxiated
by
the
fall
but
if
they
had
escaped
asphyxia
how
had
they
escaped
being
drowned
in
the
pacific
the
remains
of
the
deck
the
blades
of
the
propellers
the
compartments
of
the
cabins
all
formed
a
sort
of
raft
when
a
wounded
bird
falls
on
the
waves
its
wings
keep
it
afloat
for
several
hours
robur
and
his
men
remained
unhelped
at
first
on
the
wreck
and
afterwards
in
the
boat
that
had
fallen
uninjured
a
few
hours
after
sunrise
they
were
sighted
by
a
passing
ship
and
a
boat
was
lowered
to
their
rescue
robur
and
his
companions
were
saved
and
so
was
much
of
what
remained
of
the
aeronef
the
engineer
said
that
his
ship
had
perished
in
a
collision
and
no
further
questions
were
asked
him
the
ship
was
an
english
the
two
friends
bound
for
melbourne
where
she
arrived
a
few
days
afterwards
robur
was
in
australia
but
a
long
way
from
x
island
to
which
he
desired
to
return
as
soon
as
possible
in
the
ruins
of
the
aftermost
cabin
he
had
found
a
considerable
sum
of
money
quite
enough
to
provide
for
himself
and
companions
without
applying
to
anyone
for
help
a
short
time
after
he
arrived
in
melbourne
he
became
the
owner
of
a
small
brigantine
of
about
a
hundred
tons
and
in
her
he
sailed
for
x
island
there
he
had
but
one
idea
to
be
avenged
but
to
secure
his
vengeance
he
would
have
to
make
another
albatross
this
after
all
was
an
easy
task
for
him
who
made
the
first
he
used
up
what
he
could
of
the
old
material
the
propellers
and
engines
he
had
brought
back
in
the
brigantine
the
mechanism
was
fitted
with
new
piles
and
new
accumulators
and
in
short
in
less
than
eight
months
the
work
was
finished
and
a
new
albatross
identical
with
the
one
destroyed
by
the
explosion
was
ready
to
take
flight
and
he
had
the
same
crew
the
albatross
left
x
island
in
the
first
week
of
april
during
this
aerial
passage
robur
did
not
want
to
be
seen
from
the
earth
and
he
came
along
almost
always
above
the
clouds
when
he
arrived
over
north
america
he
descended
in
a
desolate
spot
in
the
far
west
there
the
engineer
keeping
a
profound
incognito
learnt
with
considerable
pleasure
that
the
weldon
institute
was
about
to
begin
its
experiments
and
that
the
with
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
was
going
to
start
from
philadelphia
on
the
of
april
here
was
a
chance
for
robur
and
his
crew
to
gratify
their
longing
for
revenge
here
was
a
chance
for
inflicting
on
their
foes
a
terrible
vengeance
which
in
the
they
could
not
escape
a
public
vengeance
which
would
at
the
same
time
prove
the
superiority
of
the
aeronef
to
all
aerostats
and
contrivances
of
that
nature
and
that
is
why
on
this
very
day
like
a
vulture
from
the
clouds
the
aeronef
appeared
over
fairmount
park
yes
it
was
the
albatross
easily
recognizable
by
all
those
who
had
never
before
seen
her
the
was
in
full
flight
but
it
soon
appeared
that
she
could
not
escape
horizontally
and
so
she
sought
her
safety
in
a
vertical
direction
not
dropping
to
the
ground
for
the
aeronef
would
have
cut
her
off
but
rising
to
a
zone
where
she
could
not
perhaps
be
reached
this
was
very
daring
and
at
the
same
time
very
logical
but
the
albatross
began
to
rise
after
her
although
she
was
smaller
than
the
it
was
a
case
of
the
swordfish
and
the
whale
this
could
easily
be
seen
from
below
and
with
what
anxiety
in
a
few
moments
the
aerostat
had
attained
a
height
of
sixteen
thousand
feet
the
albatross
followed
her
as
she
rose
she
flew
round
her
flanks
and
maneuvered
round
her
in
a
circle
with
a
constantly
diminishing
radius
she
could
have
annihilated
her
at
a
stroke
and
uncle
prudent
and
his
companions
would
have
been
dashed
to
atoms
in
a
frightful
fall
the
people
mute
with
horror
gazed
breathlessly
they
were
seized
with
that
sort
of
fear
which
presses
on
the
chest
and
grips
the
legs
when
we
see
anyone
fall
from
a
height
an
aerial
combat
was
beginning
in
which
there
were
none
of
the
chances
of
safety
as
in
a
it
was
the
first
of
its
kind
but
it
would
not
be
the
last
for
progress
is
one
of
the
laws
of
this
world
and
if
the
was
flying
the
american
colors
did
not
the
albatross
display
the
stars
and
golden
sun
of
robur
the
conqueror
the
tried
to
distance
her
enemy
by
rising
still
higher
she
threw
away
the
ballast
she
had
in
reserve
she
made
a
new
leap
of
three
thousand
feet
she
was
now
but
a
dot
in
space
the
albatross
which
followed
her
round
and
round
at
top
speed
was
now
invisible
suddenly
a
shout
of
terror
rose
from
the
crowd
the
increased
rapidly
in
size
and
the
aeronef
appeared
dropping
with
her
this
time
it
was
a
fall
the
gas
had
dilated
in
the
higher
zones
of
the
atmosphere
and
had
burst
the
balloon
which
half
inflated
still
was
falling
rapidly
but
the
aeronef
slowing
her
suspensory
screws
came
down
just
as
fast
she
ran
alongside
the
when
she
was
not
more
than
four
thousand
feet
from
the
ground
would
robur
destroy
her
no
he
was
going
to
save
her
crew
and
so
cleverly
did
he
handle
his
vessel
that
the
aeronaut
jumped
on
board
would
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
refuse
to
be
saved
by
him
they
were
quite
capable
of
doing
so
but
the
crew
threw
themselves
on
them
and
dragged
them
by
force
from
the
to
the
albatross
then
the
aeronef
glided
off
and
remained
stationary
while
the
balloon
quite
empty
of
gas
fell
on
the
trees
of
the
clearing
and
hung
there
like
a
gigantic
rag
an
appalling
silence
reigned
on
the
ground
it
seemed
as
though
life
were
suspended
in
each
of
the
crowd
and
many
eyes
had
been
closed
so
as
not
to
behold
the
final
catastrophe
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
had
again
become
the
prisoners
of
the
redoubtable
robur
now
he
had
recaptured
them
would
he
carry
them
off
into
space
where
it
was
impossible
to
follow
him
it
seemed
so
however
instead
of
mounting
into
the
sky
the
albatross
stopped
six
feet
from
the
ground
then
amid
profound
silence
the
voice
was
heard
citizens
of
the
united
states
he
said
the
president
and
secretary
of
the
weldon
institute
are
again
in
my
power
in
keeping
them
i
am
only
within
my
right
but
from
the
passion
kindled
in
them
by
the
success
of
the
albatross
i
see
that
their
minds
are
not
prepared
for
that
important
revolution
which
the
conquest
of
the
air
will
one
day
bring
uncle
prudent
and
phil
evans
you
are
free
the
president
the
secretary
and
the
aeronaut
had
only
to
jump
down
then
robur
continued
citizens
of
the
united
states
my
experiment
is
finished
but
my
advice
to
those
present
is
to
be
premature
in
nothing
not
even
in
progress
it
is
evolution
and
not
revolution
that
we
should
seek
in
a
word
we
must
not
be
before
our
time
i
have
come
too
soon
today
to
withstand
such
contradictory
and
divided
interests
as
yours
nations
are
not
yet
fit
for
union
i
go
then
and
i
take
my
secret
with
me
but
it
will
not
be
lost
to
humanity
it
will
belong
to
you
the
day
you
are
educated
enough
to
profit
by
it
and
wise
enough
not
to
abuse
it
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
the
albatross
beating
the
air
with
her
screws
and
driven
by
her
propellers
shot
off
towards
the
east
amid
a
tempest
of
cheers
the
two
colleagues
profoundly
humiliated
and
through
them
the
whole
weldon
institute
did
the
only
thing
they
could
they
went
home
and
the
crowd
by
a
sudden
change
of
front
greeted
them
with
particularly
keen
sarcasms
and
at
their
expense
are
sarcastic
still
and
now
who
is
this
robur
shall
we
ever
know
we
know
today
robur
is
the
science
of
the
future
perhaps
the
science
of
tomorrow
certainly
the
science
that
will
come
does
the
albatross
still
cruise
in
the
atmosphere
in
the
realm
that
none
can
take
from
her
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
it
will
robur
the
conqueror
appear
one
day
as
he
said
yes
he
will
come
to
declare
the
secret
of
his
invention
which
will
greatly
change
the
social
and
political
conditions
of
the
world
as
for
the
future
of
aerial
locomotion
it
belongs
to
the
aeronef
and
not
the
aerostat
it
is
to
the
albatross
that
the
conquest
of
the
air
will
assuredly
fall
end
of
voyage
extraordinaire
robur
the
conqueror
