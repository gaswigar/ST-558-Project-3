the

spread
through

like
wild

hundreds
of

with

who
had
been
thrown
out

their

in

for
an
immediate
migration
to
the
land
of
promise
before
midsummer
they
had
started
on
the
long
and
perilous
journey
how
little
did
they
know
of
its
exposures
the
deserts
destitute
of
water
and
grass
the
alkaline
plains
where
food
and
drink
were
alike
affected
by
the
poisonous
dust

all
these
fled
in
the
light
of
the
summer
sun
the
vernal
beauty
of
the
plains
and
the
delightfully
pure
atmosphere
which
wooed
them
day
by
day
farther
away
from
the
abode
of
civilization
and
the
protection
of
law
the
most
fortunate
of
this
army
of
adventurers
suffered
from
some
of
these
fruitful
causes
of
disaster
so
certain
were
they
to
occur
in
some
form
that
a
successful
completion
of
the
journey
was
simply
an
escape
from
death
the
story
of
the
indian
murders
and
cruelties
alone
which
befell
hundreds
of
these
hapless
emigrants
would
fill
volumes
every
mile
of
the
several
routes
across
the
continent
was
marked
by
the
decaying
carcasses
of
oxen
and
horses
which
had
perished
during
the
period
of
this
hegira
to
the
gold
mines
three
months
with
mules
and
four
with
oxen
were
necessary
to
make
the
journey
a
journey
now
completed
in
five
days
from
ocean
to

by

some
of
these
expeditions
after
entering
the
unexplored
region
which
afterwards
became
montana
were
arrested
by
the
information
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
cross
with
wagon

several
mountain
ranges

and
the
mines
in
the
summer
of
a

left

salmon
river
mines
this
northern
overland
expedition
was
confided
to
the
leadership
of
captain
james
fisk
whose
previous
frontier
experience
and
unquestionable
personal
courage
admirably
fitted
him
for
the
command
of
an
expedition
which
owed
so
much
of
its
final
success
as
well
as
its
safety
during
a
hazardous
journey
through
a
region
occupied
by
hostile

and

started
with

on
this
journey
on
the
day
of
june
traveling
by
the
way
of
fort
abercrombie
old
fort

milk
river
and
fort
benton
bridging
all
the
streams
not
fordable
on
the
entire
route
fort
union
and
fort
benton
were
not
united
states
military
forts
but
were
the
old
trading
posts
of
the
american
fur
company
this
northern
overland
route
of
over
miles
lay
for
most
of
the
distance
through
a
partially
explored
region
filled
with
numerous
bands
of
the
hostile
sioux
indians
it
was
the
year
of
the
sioux
indian
massacre
in
minnesota
after
a
continuous
journey
of
upwards
of
eighteen
weeks
we
reached
grasshopper
creek
near
the
head
of
the
missouri
on
the
day
of
october
with
our
supply
of
provisions
nearly
exhausted
and
with
cattle
and
too
much
worn
out
to
continue
the
journey
there
we
camped
for
the
winter
in
the
midst
of
the
wilderness
miles
from
the
nearest
settlement
or
postoffice
from
which
we
were
separated
by
a
region
of
mountainous
country
rendered
nearly
impassable
in
the
winter
by
deep
snows
and
beset
for
the
entire
distance
by
hostile
indians
disheartening
as
the
prospect
was
we
felt
that
it
would
not
do
to
give
way
to
discouragement
a
few
venturesome
prospectors
from
the
west
side
of
the
rocky
mountains
had
found
gold
in
small
quantities
on
the
bars
bordering
the
stream
and
a
few
traders
had
followed
in
their
wake
with
a
limited
supply
of
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
risking
the
dangers
of
indian
attack
by
the
way
to
obtain
large
profits
as
a
rightful
reward
for
their
temerity
flour
was
worth
cents
per
pound
in
greenbacks
and
prices
of
other
commodities
were
in
like
proportion
and
the
placer
unpromising
and
many
of
the
unemployed
started
out
some
on
foot
and
some
bestride
their
animals
into
the
bleak
mountain
wilderness
in
search
of
gold
with
the
certainty
of
death
in
its
most
horrid
form
if
they
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
band
of
prowling
blackfeet
indians
and
the
thought
uppermost
in
their
minds
that
they
could
scarcely
escape
freezing
surely
the
hope
which
sustained
this
little
band
of
wanderers
lacked
none
of
those
grand
elements
which
sustained
the
early
settlers
of
our
country
in
their
days
of
disaster
and
suffering
men
who
cavil
with
providence
and
attribute
to
luck
or
chance
or
accident
the
escape
from
massacre
and
starvation
of
a
company
of
destitute
men
under
circumstances
like
these
are
either
wanting
in
gratitude
or
have
never
been
overtaken
by
calamity
my
recollection
of
those
gloomy
days
is
all
the
more
vivid
because
i
was
among
the
indigent
ones
this
region
was
then
the
rendezvous
of
the
bannack
indians
and
we
named
the
settlement
bannack
not
the
scotch
name
bannock
now
often
given
to
it
montana
was
organized
as
a
territory
on
the
day
of
may
and
i
continued
to
reside
in
that
territory
until
the
year
being
engaged
chiefly
in
official
business
of
a
character
which
made
it
necessary
from
time
to
time
for
me
to
visit
all
portions
of
the
territory
it
is
a
beautiful
country
nature
displays
her
wonders
there
upon
the
most
magnificent
scale
lofty
ranges
of
mountains
broad
and
fertile
valleys
streams
broken
into
torrents
are
the
scenery
of
life
these
are
rendered
enjoyable
by
clear
skies
pure
atmosphere
and
invigorating
climate
ever
since
the
first
year
of
my
residence
there
i
had
frequently
heard
rumors
of
the
existence
of
wonderful
phenomena
in
the
region
where
the
yellowstone
wind
snake
and
other
large
rivers
take
their
rise
and
as
often
had
determined
to
improve
the
first
opportunity
to
visit
and
explore
it
but
had
been
deterred
by
the
presence
of
unusual
and
insurmountable
dangers
it
was
at
that
time
inhabited
only
by
wild
beasts
and
roving
bands
of
hostile
indians
an
occasional
trapper
or
old
mountaineer
were
the
only
white
persons
who
had
ever
seen
even
those
portions
of
it
nearest
to
civilization
previous
to
the
visit
of
david
folsom
and
cook
in
the
year
of
these
some
had
seen
one
some
another
object
of
interest
but
as
they
were
all
believed
to
be
romancers
their
stories
were
received
with
great
distrust
illustration
james
bridger
the
old
mountaineers
of
montana
were
generally
regarded
as
great
fabricators
i
have
met
with
many
but
never
one
who
was
not
fond
of
practicing
upon
the
credulity
of
those
who
listened
to
the
recital
of
his
adventures
james
bridger
the
discoverer
of
great
salt
lake
who
had
a
large
experience
in
wild
mountain
life
wove
so
much
of
romance
around
his
indian
adventures
that
his
narrations
were
generally
received
with
many
grains
of
allowance
by
his
listeners
probably
no
man
ever
had
a
more
varied
and
interesting
experience
during
a
long
period
of
sojourning
on
the
western
plains
and
in
the
rocky
mountains
than
bridger
and
he
did
not
hesitate
if
a
favorable
occasion
offered
to
guy
the
unsophisticated
at
one
time
when
in
camp
near
pumpkin
butte
a
landmark
near
fort
laramie
rising
a
thousand
feet
or
more
above
the
surrounding
plain
a
young
attache
of
the
party
approached
bridger
and
in
a
rather
patronizing
manner
said
bridger
they
tell
me
that
you
have
lived
a
long
time
on
these
plains
and
in
the
mountains
bridger
pointing
toward
pumpkin
butte
replied
young
man
you
see
that
butte
over
there
well
that
mountain
a
hole
in
the
when
i
came
here
bridger
long
sojourn
in
the
rocky
mountains
commenced
as
early
as
the
year
and
in
we
find
him
a
resident
partner
in
the
rocky
mountain
fur
company
he
frequently
spent
periods
of
time
varying
from
three
months
to
two
years
so
far
removed
from
any
settlement
or
trading
post
that
neither
flour
nor
bread
stuffs
in
any
form
could
be
obtained
the
only
available
substitute
for
bread
being
the
various
roots
found
in
the
rocky
mountain
region
i
first
became
acquainted
with
bridger
in
the
year
he
was
then
employed
by
a
wagon
road
company
of
which
i
was
president
to
conduct
the
emigration
from
the
states
to
montana
by
way
of
fort
laramie
the
big
horn
river
and
emigrant
gulch
he
told
me
in
virginia
city
at
that
time
of
the
existence
of
hot
spouting
springs
in
the
vicinity
of
the
source
of
the
yellowstone
and
madison
rivers
and
said
that
he
had
seen
a
column
of
water
as
large
as
his
body
spout
as
high
as
the
flag
pole
in
virginia
city
which
was
about
sixty
feet
high
the
more
i
pondered
upon
this
statement
the
more
i
was
impressed
with
the
probability
of
its
truth
if
he
had
told
me
of
the
existence
of
falls
one
thousand
feet
high
i
should
have
considered
his
story
an
exaggeration
of
a
phenomenon
he
had
really
beheld
but
i
did
not
think
that
his
imagination
was
sufficiently
fertile
to
originate
the
story
of
the
existence
of
a
spouting
geyser
unless
he
had
really
seen
one
and
i
therefore
was
inclined
to
give
credence
to
his
statement
and
to
believe
that
such
a
wonder
did
really
exist
i
was
the
more
disposed
to
credit
his
statement
because
of
what
i
had
previously
read
in
the
report
of
captain
john
mullan
made
to
the
war
department
from
my
present
examination
of
that
report
which
was
made
and
a
copy
of
which
i
still
have
in
my
possession
i
find
that
captain
mullan
says
i
learned
from
the
indians
and
afterwards
confirmed
by
my
own
explorations
the
fact
of
the
existence
of
an
infinite
number
of
hot
springs
at
the
headwaters
of
the
missouri
columbia
and
yellowstone
rivers
and
that
hot
geysers
similar
to
those
of
california
exist
at
the
head
of
the
yellowstone
again
he
speaks
of
the
isochimenal
line
a
line
of
even
winter
temperature
which
he
says
reaches
from
fort
laramie
to
the
headwaters
of
the
yellowstone
at
the
hot
spring
and
geysers
of
that
stream
and
continues
thence
to
the
beaver
head
valley
and
he
adds
this
is
as
true
as
it
is
strange
and
shows
unerringly
that
there
exists
in
this
zone
an
atmospheric
river
of
heat
flowing
through
this
region
varying
in
width
from
one
to
one
hundred
miles
according
to
the
physical
face
of
the
country
illustration
very
much
yours
folsom
as
early
as
the
year
i
first
considered
the
possibility
of
organizing
an
expedition
for
the
purpose
of
exploring
the
upper
yellowstone
to
its
source
the
first
move
which
i
made
looking
to
this
end
was
in
and
the
next
in
but
these
efforts
ended
in
nothing
more
than
a
general
discussion
of
the
subject
of
an
exploration
the
most
potent
factor
in
the
abandonment
of
the
enterprise
being
the
threatened
outbreaks
of
the
indians
in
gallatin
valley
the
following
year
the
project
was
again
revived
and
plans
formed
for
an
expedition
but
again
the
hostility
of
the
indians
prevented
the
accomplishment
of
our
purpose
of
exploration
hon
david
folsom
was
enrolled
as
one
of
the
members
of
this
expedition
and
when
it
was
found
that
no
large
party
could
be
organized
folsom
and
his
partner
cook
and
peterson
a
helper
on
the
folsom
ranch
in
the
face
of
the
threatened
dangers
from
indians
visited
the
grand
cañon
the
falls
of
the
yellowstone
and
yellowstone
lake
and
then
turned
in
a
northwesterly
direction
emerging
into
the
lower
geyser
basin
where
they
found
a
geyser
in
action
the
water
of
which
says
folsom
in
his
record
of
the
expedition
came
rushing
up
and
shot
into
the
air
at
least
eighty
feet
causing
us
to
stampede
for
higher
ground
folsom
in
speaking
of
the
various
efforts
made
to
organize
an
expedition
for
exploration
of
the
yellowstone
says
in
an
exploring
expedition
from
virginia
city
montana
territory
was
talked
of
but
for
some
unknown
reason
probably
for
the
want
of
a
sufficient
number
to
engage
in
it
it
was
abandoned
the
next
year
another
was
planned
which
ended
like
the
first
in
talk
early
in
the
summer
of
the
newspapers
throughout
the
territory
announced
that
a
party
of
citizens
from
helena
virginia
city
and
bozeman
accompanied
by
some
of
the
officers
stationed
at
fort
ellis
with
an
escort
of
soldiers
would
leave
bozeman
about
the
fifth
of
september
for
the
yellowstone
country
with
the
intention
of
making
a
thorough
examination
of
all
the
wonders
with
which
the
region
was
said
to
abound
the
party
was
expected
to
be
limited
in
numbers
and
to
be
composed
of
some
of
the
most
prominent
men
in
the
territory
and
the
writer
felt
extremely
flattered
when
his
earnest
request
to
have
his
name
added
to
the
list
was
granted
he
joined
with
two
personal
friends
in
getting
an
outfit
and
then
waited
patiently
for
the
other
members
of
the
party
to
perfect
their
arrangements
about
a
month
before
the
day
fixed
for
starting
some
of
the
members
began
to
discover
that
pressing
business
engagements
would
prevent
their
going
then
came
news
from
fort
ellis
that
owing
to
some
changes
made
in
the
disposition
of
troops
stationed
in
the
territory
the
military
portion
of
the
party
would
be
unable
to
join
the
expedition
and
our
party
which
had
now
dwindled
down
to
ten
or
twelve
persons
thinking
it
would
be
unsafe
for
so
small
a
number
to
venture
where
there
was
a
strong
probability
of
meeting
with
hostile
indians
also
abandoned
the
undertaking
but
the
writer
and
his
two
friends
before
mentioned
believing
that
the
dangers
to
be
encountered
had
been
magnified
and
trusting
by
vigilance
and
good
luck
to
avoid
them
resolved
to
attempt
the
journey
at
all
hazards
we
provided
ourselves
with
five
horses
three
of
them
for
the
saddle
and
the
other
two
for
carrying
our
cooking
utensils
ammunition
fishing
tackle
blankets
and
buffalo
robes
a
pick
and
a
pan
a
shovel
an
axe
and
provisions
necessary
for
a
six
weeks
trip
we
were
all
well
armed
with
repeating
rifles
colt
and
and
had
besides
a
double
barreled
shotgun
for
small
game
we
also
had
a
good
field
glass
a
pocket
compass
and
a
thermometer
illustration
cook
folsom
followed
the
yellowstone
to
the
lake
and
crossed
over
to
the
firehole
which
he
followed
up
as
far
as
the
excelsior
geyser
not
then
named
but
did
not
visit
the
upper
geyser
basin
on
his
return
to
helena
he
related
to
a
few
of
his
intimate
friends
many
of
the
incidents
of
his
journey
and
samuel
hauser
and
i
invited
him
to
meet
a
number
of
the
citizens
of
helena
at
the
directors
room
of
the
first
national
bank
in
helena
but
on
assembling
there
were
so
many
present
who
were
unknown
to
folsom
that
he
was
unwilling
to
risk
his
reputation
for
veracity
by
a
full
recital
in
the
presence
of
strangers
of
the
wonders
he
had
seen
he
said
that
he
did
not
wish
to
be
regarded
as
a
liar
by
those
who
were
unacquainted
with
his
reputation

he
gave

and
myself
renewed
in
us
our
determination
to
visit
that
region
during
the
following
year
folsom
however
sent
to
the
western
monthly
of
chicago
a
carefully
prepared
account
of
his
expedition
which
that
magazine
published
in
july
after
cutting
out
some
of
the
most
interesting
portions
of
the
story
thus
destroying
in
some
measure
the
continuity
of
the
narrative
the
office
of
the
western
monthly
was
destroyed
by
fire
before
the
copies
of
the
magazine
containing
folsom
article
were
distributed
and
the
single
copy
which
folsom
possessed
and
which
he
presented
to
the
historical
society
of
montana
met
a
like
fate
in
the
great
helena
fire
the
copy
which
i
possessed
and
which
i
afterwards
presented
to
that
society
is
doubtless
the
only
original
copy
now
in
existence
and
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
the
history
of
the
initial
step
which
eventuated
in
the
creation
of
the
yellowstone
national
park
i
in
the
year
copies
of
folsom
narrative
for
distribution
among
those
most
interested
in
that
exploration
in
the
spring
of
while
in
paul
i
had
an
interview
with
major
general
winfield
hancock
during
which
he
showed
great
interest
in
the
plan
of
exploration
which
i
outlined
to
him
and
expressed
a
desire
to
obtain
additional
information
concerning
the
yellowstone
country
which
would
be
of
service
to
him
in
the
disposition
of
troops
for
frontier
defense
and
he
assured
me
that
unless
some
unforeseen
exigency
prevented
he
would
when
the
time
arrived
give
a
favorable
response
to
our
application
for
a
military
escort
if
one
were
needed
hauser
also
had
a
conference
with
general
hancock
about
the
same
time
and
received
from
him
like
assurances
about
the
of
august
our
plans
took
definite
shape
and
some
twenty
men
were
enrolled
as
members
of
the
exploring
party
about
this
time
the
crow
indians
again
broke
loose
and
a
raid
of
the
gallatin
and
yellowstone
valleys
was
threatened
and
a
majority
of
those
who
had
enrolled
their
names
experiencing
that
decline
of
courage
so
aptly
illustrated
by
bob
acres
suddenly
found
excuse
for
withdrawal
in
various
emergent
occupations
after
a
few
days
of
suspense
and
doubt
samuel
hauser
told
me
that
if
he
could
find
two
men
whom
he
knew
who
would
accompany
him
he
would
attempt
the
journey
and
he
asked
me
to
join
him
in
a
letter
to
james
stuart
living
at
deer
lodge
proposing
that
he
should
go
with
us
benjamin
stickney
one
of
the
most
enthusiastic
of
our
number
also
wrote
to
stuart
that
there
were
eight
persons
who
would
go
at
all
hazards
and
asked
him
stuart
to
be
a
member
of
the
party
stuart
replied
to
hauser
and
myself
as
follows
deer
lodge
city
dear
sam
and
langford
stickney
wrote
me
that
the
yellow
stone
party
had
dwindled
down
to
eight
persons
that
is
not
enough
to
stand
guard
and
i
wo
go
into
that
country
without
having
a
guard
every
night
from
present
news
it
is
probable
that
the
crows
will
be
scattered
on
all
the
headwaters
of
the
yellow
stone
and
if
that
is
the
case
they
would
not
want
any
better
fun
than
to
clean
up
a
party
of
eight
that
does
not
stand
guard
and
say
that
the
sioux
did
it
as
they
said
when
they
went
through
us
on
the
big
horn
it
will
not
be
safe
to
go
into
that
country
with
less
than
fifteen
men
and
not
very
safe
with
that
number
i
would
like
it
better
if
it
was
fight
from
the
start
we
would
then
kill
every
crow
that
we
saw
and
take
the
chances
of
their
rubbing
us
out
as
it
is
we
will
have
to
let
them
alone
until
they
will
get
the
best
of
us
by
stealing
our
horses
or
killing
some
of
us
then
we
will
be
so
crippled
that
we
ca
do
them
any
damage
at
the
commencement
of
this
letter
i
said
i
would
not
go
unless
the
party
stood
guard
i
will
take
that
back
for
i
am
just
d
d
fool
enough
to
go
anywhere
that
anybody
else
is
willing
to
go
only
i
want
it
understood
that
very
likely
some
of
us
will
lose
our
hair
i
will
be
on
hand
sunday
evening
unless
i
hear
that
the
trip
is
postponed
fraternally
yours
jas
stuart
since
writing
the
above
i
have
received
a
telegram
saying
twelve
of
us
going
certain
glad
to
hear
it
the
more
the
better
will
bring
two
pack
horses
and
one
pack
saddle
i
have
preserved
this
letter
of
james
stuart
for
the
years
since
it
was
received
it
was
written
with
a
lead
pencil
on
both
sides
of
a
sheet
of
paper
and
i
insert
here
a
photograph
of
a
reproduction
of
it

has
become
somewhat
illegible
and
obscure

repeated

and
unfolding

stuart
was
a
man
of
large
experience
in
such
enterprises
as
that
in
which
we
were
about
to
engage
and
was
familiar
with
all
the
tricks
of
indian
craft
and
sagacity
and
our
subsequent
experience
in
meeting
the
indians
on
the
second
day
of
our
journey
after
leaving
fort
ellis
and
their
evident
hostile
intentions
justified
in
the
fullest
degree
stuart
apprehensions
about
this
time
henry
washburn
the
surveyor
general
of
montana
joined
with
hauser
in
a
telegram
to
general
hancock
at
paul
requesting
him
to
provide
the
promised
escort
of
a
company
of
cavalry
general
hancock
immediately
responded
and
on
august
telegraphed
an
order
on
the
commandant
at
fort
ellis
near
bozeman
for
such
escort
as
would
be
deemed
necessary
to
insure
the
safety
of
our
party
just
at
this
critical
time
i
received
a
letter
from
stuart
announcing
that
he
had
been
drawn
as
a
juryman
to
serve
at
the
term
of
court
then
about
to
open
and
that
as
the
federal
judge
declined
to
excuse
him
he
would
not
be
able
to
join
our
party
this
was
a
sore
and
discouraging
disappointment
both
to
hauser
and
myself
for
we
felt
that
in
case
we
had
trouble
with
the
indians
stuart
services
to
the
party
would
be
worth
those
of
half
a
dozen
ordinary
men
a
new
roster
was
made
up
and
i
question
if
there
was
ever
a
body
of
men
organized
for
an
exploring
expedition
more
intelligent
or
more
keenly
alive
to
the
risks
to
be
encountered
than
those
then
enrolled
and
it
seems
proper
that
i
here
speak
more
specifically
of
them
henry
washburn
was
the
surveyor
general
of
montana
and
had
been
brevetted
a
major
general
for
services
in
the
civil
war
and
had
served
two
terms
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
judge
cornelius
hedges
was
a
distinguished
and
highly
esteemed
member
of
the
montana
bar
samuel
hauser
was
a
civil
engineer
and
was
president
of
the
first
national
bank
of
helena
he
was
afterwards
appointed
governor
of
montana
by
grover
cleveland
warren
gillette
and
benjamin
stickney
were
pioneer
merchants
in
montana
walter
trumbull
was
assistant
assessor
of
internal
revenue
and
a
son
of
united
states
senator
lyman
trumbull
of
illinois
truman
everts
was
assessor
of
internal
revenue
for
montana
and
nathaniel
langford
the
writer
had
been
for
nearly
five
years
the
united
states
collector
of
internal
revenue
for
montana
and
had
been
appointed
governor
of
montana
by
andrew
johnson
but
owing
to
the
imbroglio
of
the
senate
with
johnson
his
appointment
was
not
confirmed
illustration
james
stuart
while
we
were
disappointed
in
our
expectation
of
having
james
stuart
for
our
commander
and
adviser
general
washburn
was
chosen
captain
of
the
party
and
stickney
was
appointed
commissary
and
instructed
to
put
up
in
proper
form
a
supply
of
provisions
sufficient
for
thirty
days
though
we
had
contemplated
a
limit
of
days
for
our
absence
each
man
promptly
paid
to
stickney
his
share
of
the
estimated
expense
when
all
these
preparations
had
been
made
jake
smith
requested
permission
to
be
enrolled
as
a
member
of
our
company
jake
was
constitutionally
unfitted
to
be
a
member
of
such
a
party
of
exploration
where
vigilance
and
alertness
were
essential
to
safety
and
success
he
was
too
inconsequent
and
easy
going
to
command
our
confidence
or
to
be
of
much
assistance
he
seemed
to
think
that
his
nonsense
would
always
be
a
passport
to
favor
and
be
accepted
in
the
stead
of
real
service
and
in
my
association
with
him
i
was
frequently
reminded
of
the
youth
who
announced
in
a
newspaper
advertisement
that
he
was
a
poor
but
pious
young
man
who
desired
board
in
a
family
where
there
were
small
children
and
where
his
christian
example
would
be
considered
a
sufficient
compensation
jake
did
not
share
the
view
of
the
other
members
of
our
company
that
in
standing
guard
the
sentry
should
resist
his
inclination
to
slumber
hedges
in
his
diary
published
in
volume
of
the
montana
historical
society
publications
on
september
thus
records
an
instance
of
insubordination
in
standing
guard
jake
made
a
fuss
about
his
turn
and
washburn
stood
in
his
place
now
that
this
and
like
incidents
of
our
journey
are
in
the
dim
past
let
us
inscribe
for
his
epitaph
what
was
his
own
adopted
motto
while
doing
guard
duty
when
menaced
by
the
indians
on
the

lieutenant
doane
died
at
bozeman
montana
may
his
report
to
the
war
department
of

exploration
is
a
classic
major
chittenden
says
his
fine
descriptions
have
never
been
surpassed
by
any
subsequent
writer
although
suffering
intense
physical
torture
during
the
greater
portion
of
the
trip
it
did
not
extinguish
in
him
the
truly
poetic
ardor
with
which
those
strange
phenomena
seem
to
have
inspired
him
hayden
who
first
visited
this
region
the
year
following
that
of
our
exploration
says
of
lieutenant
doane
report
i
venture
to
state
as
my
opinion
that
for
graphic
description
and
thrilling
interest
it
has
not
been
surpassed
by
any
official
report
made
to
our
government
since
the
times
of
lewis
and
clark
everts
died
at
hyattsville
on
the
day
of
february
at
the
age
of
survived
by
his
daughter
elizabeth
everts
verrill
and
a
young
widow
and
also
a
son
nine
years
old
born
when
everts
was
years
of
age
a
living
monument
to
bear
testimony
to
that
physical
vigor
and
vitality
which
carried
him
through
the
days
of
peril
when
he
was
lost
from
our
party
in
the
dense
forest
on
the
southwest
shore
of
yellowstone
lake
general
washburn
died
on
january
his
death
being
doubtless
hastened
by
the
hardships
and
exposures
of
our
journey
from
which
many
of
our
party
suffered
in
greater
or
less
degree
in
an
eloquent
eulogistic
address
delivered
in
helena
january
judge
cornelius
hedges
said
concerning
the
naming
of
mount
washburn
on
the
west
bank
of
the
yellowstone
between
tower
fall
and
springs
opposite
the
profoundest
chasm
of
that
marvelous
river
cañon
a
mighty
sentinel
overlooking
that
region
of
wonders
rises
in
its
serene
and
solitary
grandeur
mount
washburn
pointing
the
way
his
enfranchised
spirit
was
so
soon
to
soar
he
was
the
first
to
climb
its
bare
bald
summit
and
thence
reported
to
us
the
welcome
news
that
he
saw
the
beautiful
lake
that
had
been
the
proposed
object
of
our
journey
by
unanimous
voice
unsolicited
by
him
we
gave
the
mountain
a
name
that
through
coming
years
shall
bear
onward
the
memory
of
our
gallant
generous
leader
how
little
we
then
thought
that
he
would
be
the
first
to
live
only
in
memory
the
deep
forests
of
evergreen
pine
that
embosom
that
lake
shall
typify
the
ever
green
spot
in
our
memory
where
shall
cluster
the
pleasant
recollections
of
our
varied
experiences
on
that
expedition
the
question
is
frequently
asked
who
originated
the
plan
of
setting
apart
this
region
as
a
national
park
i
answer
that
judge
cornelius
hedges
of
helena
wrote
the
first
articles
ever
published
by
the
press
urging
the
dedication
of
this
region
as
a
park
the
helena
herald
of
contains
a
letter
of
hedges
in
which
he
advocated
the
scheme
and
in
my
lectures
delivered
in
washington
and
new
york
in
january
i
directed
attention
to
hedges
suggestion
and
urged
the
passage
by
congress
of
an
act
setting
apart
that
region
as
a
public
park
all
this
was
several
months
prior
to
the
first
exploration
by
the
geological
survey
in
charge
of
hayden
the
suggestion
that
the
region
should
be
made
into
a
national
park
was
first
broached
to
the
members
of
our
party
on
september
by
hedges
while
we
were
in
camp
at
the
confluence
of
the
firehole
and
gibbon
rivers
as
is
related
in
this
diary
after
the
return
home
of
our
party
i
was
informed
by
general
washburn
that
on
the
eve
of
the
departure
of
our
expedition
from
helena
david
folsom
had
suggested
to
him
the
desirability
of
creating
a
park
at
the
grand
cañon
and
falls
of
the
yellowstone
this
fact
was
unknown
to
hedges
and
the
boundary
lines
of
the
proposed
park
were
extended
by
him
so
as
to
be
commensurate
with
the
wider
range
of
our
explorations
the
bill
for
the
creation
of
the
park
was
introduced
in
the
house
of
representatives
by
hon
william
clagett
delegate
from
montana
territory
on
july
william
marshall
secretary
of
the
minnesota
historical
society
wrote
to
clagett
asking
him
the
question
who
are
entitled
to
the
principal
credit
for
the
passage
of
the
act
of
congress
establishing
the
yellowstone
national
park
clagett
replied
as
follows
coeur
idaho
july
wm
marshall
secretary
minnesota
historical
society
paul
dear
sir
your
favor
of
july
is
just
received
i
am
glad
that
you
have
called
my
attention
to
the
question
who
are
entitled
to
the
principal
credit
for
the
passage
of
the
act
of
congress
establishing
the
yellowstone
national
park
the
history
of
that
measure
as
far
as
known
to
me
is
as
follows
in
the
fall
of
soon
after
the
return
of
the
party
two
printers
at
deer
lodge
city
montana
went
into
the
firehole
basin
and
cut
a
large
number
of
poles
intending
to
come
back
the
next
summer
and
fence
in
the
tract
of
land
containing
the
principal
geysers
and
hold
possession
for
speculative
purposes
as
the
hutchins
family
so
long
held
the
yosemite
valley
one
of
these
men
was
named
harry
norton
he
subsequently
wrote
a
book
on
the
park
the
other
one
was
named
brown
he
now
lives
in
spokane
and
both
of
them
in
the
summer
of
worked
in
the
new
northwest
office
at
deer
lodge
when
i
learned
from
them
in
the
late
fall
of
or
spring
of
what
they
intended
to
do
i
remonstrated
with
them
and
stated
that
from
the
description
given
by
them
and
by
members
of
langford
party
the
whole
region
should
be
made
into
a
national
park
and
no
private
proprietorship
be
allowed
i
was
elected
delegate
to
congress
from
montana
in
august
and
after
the
election
nathaniel
langford
cornelius
hedges
and
myself
had
a
consultation
in
helena
and
agreed
that
every
effort
should
be
made
to
establish
the
park
as
soon
as
possible
and
before
any
person
had
got
a
serious
mccartney
at
the
mammoth
hot
springs
being
the
only
one
who
at
that
time
had
any
improvements
made
in
december
langford
came
to
washington
and
remained
there
for
some
time
and
we
two
counseled
together
about
the
park
project
i
drew
the
bill
to
establish
the
park
and
never
knew
professor
hayden
in
connection
with
that
bill
except
that
i
requested
langford
to
get
from
him
a
description
of
the
boundaries
of
the
proposed
park
there
was
some
delay
in
getting
the
description
and
my
recollection
is
that
langford
brought
me
the
description
after
consultation
with
professor
hayden
i
then
filled
the
blank
in
the
bill
with
the
description
and
the
bill
passed
both

just
as
it
was
drawn
and
without
any
change
or
amendment
whatsoever
after
the
bill
was
drawn
langford
stated
to
me
that
senator
pomeroy
of
kansas
was
very
anxious
to
have
the
honor
of
introducing
the
bill
in
the
senate
and
as
he
pomeroy
was
the
chairman
of
the
senate
committee
on
public
lands
in
order
to
facilitate
its
passage
i
had
a
clean
copy
made
of
the
bill
and
on
the
first
call
day
in
the
house
introduced
the
original
there
and
then
went
over
to
the
senate
chamber
and
handed
the
copy
to
senator
pomeroy
who
immediately
introduced
it
in
the
senate
the
bill
passed
the
senate
first
and
came
to
the
house
and
passed
the
house
without
amendment
at
a
time
when
i
happened
to
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
capitol
and
hence
i
was
not
present
when
it
actually
passed
the
house
since
the
passage
of
this
bill
there
have
been
so
many
men
who
have
claimed
the
exclusive
credit
for
its
passage
that
i
have
lived
for
twenty
years
suffering
from
a
chronic
feeling
of
disgust
whenever
the
subject
was
mentioned
so
far
as
my
personal
knowledge
goes
the
first
idea
of
making
it
a
public
park
occurred
to
myself
but
from
information
received
from
langford
and
others
it
has
always
been
my
opinion
that
hedges
langford
and
myself
formed
the
same
idea
about
the
same
time
and
we
all
three
acted
together
in
montana
and
afterwards
langford
and
i
acted
with
professor
hayden
in
washington
in
the
winter
of
the
fact
is
that
the
matter
was
well
under
way
before
professor
hayden
was
ever
heard
of
in
connection
with
that
measure
when
he
returned
to
washington
in
he
brought
with
him
a
large
number
of
specimens
from
different
parts
of
the
park
which
were
on
exhibition
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
capitol
or
in
the
smithsonian
institute
one
or
the
other
while
congress
was
in
session
and
he
rendered
valuable
services
in
exhibiting
these
specimens
and
explaining
the
geological
and
other
features
of
the
proposed
park
and
between
him
langford
and
myself
i
believe
there
was
not
a
single
member
of
congress
in
either
house
who
was
not
fully
posted
by
one
or
the
other
of
us
in
personal
interviews
so
much
so
that
the
bill
practically
passed
both
houses
without
objection
it
has
always
been
a
pleasure
to
me
to
give
to
professor
hayden
and
to
senator
pomeroy
and
dawes
of
mass
all
of
the
credit
which
they
deserve
in
connection
with
the
passage
of
that
measure
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
the
origin
of
the
movement
which
created
the
park
was
with
hedges
langford
and
myself
and
after
congress
met
langford
and
i
probably
did
if
not
of
all
the
work
connected
with
its
passage
i
think
that
the
foregoing
letter
contains
a
full
statement
of
what
you
wish
and
i
hope
that
you
will
be
able
to
correct
at
least
to
some
extent
the
misconceptions
which
the
selfish
vanity
of
some
people
has
occasioned
on
the
subject

truly

refer

personal

the
act

appointed

the
duties

the

more
than
five

without
compensation
of
any
kind
and
paying
my
own
expenses
soon
after
the
creation
of
the
park
the
secretary
of
the
interior
received
many
applications
for
leases
to
run
for
a
long
term
of
years
of
tracts
of
land
in
the
vicinity
of
the
principal
marvels
of
that
region
such
as
the
grand
cañon
and

the
upper
geyser
basin
etc
these
applications
were
invariably
referred
to
me
by
the
assistant
secretary
of
the
interior
hon
cowen
it
was
apparent
from
an
examination
of
these
applications
that
the
purpose
of
the
applicants
was
to
enclose
with
fences
their
holdings
and
charge
visitors
an
admission
fee
to
have
permitted
this
would
have
defeated
the
purpose
of
the
act
of
dedication
in
many
instances
the
applicants
made
earnest
pleas
both
personally
and
through
their
members
in
congress
to
the
interior
department
and
to
myself
for
an
approval
of
their
applications
offering
to
speedily
make
improvements
of
a
value
ranging
from

invariably
reported
unfavorably
upon
these
alluring
propositions

in
no
instance
was
my
recommendation

whom
secretary

had
given
the

the
whole
matter
and
to
judge
cowen
firmness
in
resisting
the
political
and
other
influences
that
were
brought
to
bear
is
largely
due
the
fact
that
these
early
applications
for
concessions
were
not
granted
a
time
should
never
come
when
the
american
people
will
have
forgotten
the
services
a
generation
ago
of

the
designs

unscrupulous
men

we
might

have
for
a
good
many
years
done
what
i
could
toward
protecting
the
game
in
the
yellowstone

but
what
seems
to
me
more
important
than
that
is
that
and
for
a
dozen
years
carried
on
almost
single
handed
a
fight
for
the
integrity
of
the
national
park
if
you
remember
all
through
from
or
thereabouts
to
continued
efforts
were
being
made
to
gain
control
of
the
park
by
one
syndicate
and
another
or
to
run
a
railroad
through
it
or
to
put
an
elevator
down
the
side
of
the
cañon
in
short
to
use
this
public
pleasure
ground
as
a
means
for
private
gain
there
were
half
a
dozen
of
us
who
being
very
enthusiastic
about
the
park
and
being
in
a
position
to
watch
legislation
at
washington
and
also
to
know
what
was
going
on
in
the
interior
department
kept
ourselves
very
much
alive
to
the
situation
and
succeeded
in
choking
off
half
a
dozen
of
these
projects
before
they
grew

mention
made
of
one
great
service
performed
by
him
for
the
american
people
and
for
which
they
and
their
descendants
should
always
remember
him
it
is
a
bit
of
ancient
history
now
and
largely
forgotten
by
all
except
those
who
took
an
active
part
in
the
fight
more
than
twenty
years
ago
strong
efforts
were
made
by
a
private
corporation
to
secure
a
monopoly
of
the
yellowstone
national
park
by
obtaining
from
the
government
contracts
giving
them
exclusive
privileges
within
the
park
this
corporation
secured
an
agreement
from
the
interior
department
by
which
six
different
plots
in
the
yellowstone
park
each
one
covering
about
one
section
of
land
a
square
mile
were
to
be
leased
to
it
for
a
period
of
ten
years
it
was
also
to
have
a
monopoly
of
hotel
stage
and
telegraph
rights
and
there
was
a
privilege
of
renewal
of
the
concession
at
the
end
of
the
ten
years
the
rate
to
be
paid
for
the
concession
was
an
acre
when
the
question
of
this
lease
came
before
congress
it
was
referred
to
a
of
the
committee
on
territories
of
which
senator
vest
was
chairman
he
investigated
the
question
and
in
the
report
made
on
it
used
these
words
nothing
but
absolute
necessity
however
should
permit
the
great
national
park
to
be
used
for
by
private
persons
and
in
our
judgment
no
such
necessity
exists
the
purpose
to
which
this
region
matchless
in
wonders
and
grandeur
was
dedicated
public
park
and
a
pleasure
ground
for
the
benefit
and
enjoyment
of
the
people
is
worthy
the
highest
patriotism
and
statesmanship
the
persons
interested
in
this
lease
came
from
many
sections
of
the
country
and
were
ably
represented
by
active
agents
in
washington
the
pressure
brought
to
bear
on
congress
was
very
great
and
the
more
effectively
applied
since
few
men
knew
much
about
conditions
in
the
yellowstone
park
or
even
where
the
yellowstone
park
was
but
pressure
and
influence
could
not
move
senator
vest
when
he
knew
he
was
right
he
stood
like
a
rock
in
congress
resisting
this
pressure
making
a
noble
fight
in
behalf
of
the
interests
of
the
people
and
at
last
winning
his
battle
for
years
the
issue
seemed
doubtful
and
for
years
it
was
true
that
the
sole
hope
of
those
who
were
devoted
to
the
interests
of
the
park
and
who
were
fighting
the
battle
of
the
public
lay
in
senator
vest
so
after
years
of
struggle
the
right
triumphed
and
the
contract
intended
to
be
made
between
the
interior
department
and
the
corporation
was
never
consummated
this
long
fight
made
evident
the
dangers
to
which
the
park
was
exposed
and
showed
the
necessity
of
additional
legislation
a
bill
to
protect
the
park

drawn
by

passed
by

from
that
time
on

life
senator

was
ever
a

this

holland
one
of
the
editors
of
that
magazine
sent
to
me
a
number
of
uncomplimentary
criticisms
of
my
article
one
reviewer
said
this
langford
must
be
the
champion
liar
of
the
northwest
resting
for
a
time
under
this
imputation
i
confess
to
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
in
reading
from
a
published
letter
written
later
in
the
summer
of
from
the
upper
geyser
basin
by
a
member
of
the
geological
survey
the
words
langford
did
not
dare
tell
of
what
he
saw
charles
whitmell
of
cardiff
wales
a
distinguished
scholar
and
astronomer
who
has
done
much
to
bring
to
the
notice
of
our
english
brothers
the
wonders
of
the
park
which
he
visited
in
in
a
lecture
delivered
before
the
cardiff
naturalists
society
on
sought
to
impress
upon
the
minds
of
his
audience
the
full
significance
of
the
above
characterization
he
said
this
quite
unique
description
means
a
great
deal
i
can
assure
you
for
western
american
lying
is
not
to
be
measured
by
any
of
our
puny
european
standards
of
untruthfulness
but
the
writings
of
wheeler
and
others
running
through
a
long
series
of
years
and
covering
an
extended
range
of
new
discoveries
have
vindicated
the
truthfulness
of
the
early
explorers
and
even
the
stories
of
bridger
are
not
now
regarded
as
exaggerations
and
we
no
longer
write
for
his
epitaph
here
lies
bridger
as
i
recall
the
events
of
this
exploration
made
years
ago
it
is
a
pleasure
to
bear
testimony
that
there
was
never
a
more
unselfish
or
generous
company
of
men
associated
for
such
an
expedition
and
notwithstanding
the
importance
of
our
discoveries
in
the
honor
of
which
each
desired
to
have
his
just
share
there
was
absolutely
neither
jealousy
nor
ungenerous
rivalry
and
the
various
magazine
and
newspaper
articles
first
published
clearly
show
how
the
members
of
our
party
were
in
honor
preferring
one
another
in
reviewing
my
diary
preparatory
to
its
publication
i
have
occasionally
eliminated
an
expression
that
seemed
to
be
too
personal
a
sprinkling
of
pepper
from
the
caster
of
my
impatience
and
i
have
also
here
and
there
added
an
explanatory
annotation
or
illustration
with
this
exception
i
here
present
the
original
notes
just
as
they
were
penned
under
the
inspiration
of
the
overwhelming
wonders
which
everywhere
revealed
themselves
to
our
astonished
vision
and
as
i
again
review
and
read
the
entries
made
in
the
field
and
around
the
campfire
in
the
journal
that
for
nearly
thirty
years
has
been
lost
to
my
sight
i
feel
all
the
thrilling
sensations
of
my
first
impressions
and
with
them
is
mingled
the
deep
regret
that
our
beloved
washburn
did
not
live
to
see
the
triumphant
accomplishment
of
what
was
dear
to
his
heart
the
setting
apart
at
the
headwaters
of
the

it
is
an
art
acquired

we
look
with
admiration
upon
our

they
throw
the
rope
with
such
precision

with
great
skill

rapidity
tighten

one
that

itself
to
the

of

he
stands
quiet
till
the

is
adjusted

the
moment
he
feels
the
tightening
of

he
asserts
his

over

to
have
a
conference
as
early
as
possible
with
the
commanding

at

also
desired
to
confer
with

the

informs
me
that
nearly
all

i
informed
him
that
we
had
an
order
for
an
escort
of
soldiers
and
he
said
that
the
garrison
was
so
weakened
that
he
could
not
spare
more
than
half
a

told
him

after

to
exercise
my
prerogative
as
grand
master
and
arrest
the
charter
of
the
lodge
as
the
only
means
of
bringing
to
a
close

grievous
state

dissension

our
ascent
of

was
somewhat
irregular
leading
us
up
several
sharp
acclivities
until
we
attained
at
the
summit
an
elevation
of
nearly
two
thousand
feet
above
the
valley
we
had
left
the
scene
from
this
point

excelled
in
grandeur

extent

variety
an
amphitheatre

large

rock
and

is
comprehended
at
a
glance
in

of
us
at
a
distance
of
twenty
miles
in
sullen
magnificence
rose
the
picturesque
range
of
the
madison
with
the
insulated
rock

and
the
sharp
pinnacle
of

peak
prominently
in

foreground
following
the

to

for

distance

commences
its

away

imperceptibly
commingling
with
the

a
thousand
feet

circumjacent
ranges

the
glowering
peaks

summits
half
enveloped
in
clouds

glittering
with
perpetual
snow
at
our
feet
apparently
within
jumping
distance
cleft
centrally
by
its
arrowy
river
carpeted
with
verdure
is
the
magnificent
valley
of
the
gallatin
like
a
rich
emerald
in
its
gorgeous
mountain
setting
fascinating
as
was
this
scene
we
gave
it
but
a
glance
and
turned
our
horses
heads
towards
the
vast
unknown
descending
the
range
to
the
east
we
reached
trail
creek
a
tributary
of
the
yellowstone
about
in
the
afternoon
where
we
are
now
camped
for
the
night
we
are
now
fairly
launched
upon
our
expedition
without
the
possibility
of
obtaining
outside
assistance
in
case
we
need
it
and
means
for
our
protection
have
been
fully
considered
since
we
camped
and
our
plans
for
guard
duty
throughout
the
trip
have
been
arranged

in

he
has
expressed
to
me
his
great
satisfaction
that
he
is
to
be
associated
with
me
throughout
the
trip
in
this
night
guard
duty
and
i
am
especially
pleased
at
being
assigned
to
duty
with
so
reliable
a
coadjutor
as
hedges
a
man
who
can
be
depended
upon
to
neglect
no
duty
we
two
are
to
stand
guard
the
first
half
of
this
first
night
that
is
until
morning
then
washburn
and
hauser
take
our
places
fresh
indian
signs
indicate
that
the
are
lurking
near
us
and
justify
the
apprehensions
expressed
in
the
letter
which
hauser
and
i
received
from
james
stuart
that
we
will
be
attacked
by
the
crow
indians
a
i
am
not
entirely
free
from
anxiety
our
safety
will
depend
upon
our
vigilance
we
are
all
well
armed
with
long
range
repeating
rifles
and
needle
guns
though
there
are
but
few
of
our
party
who
are
experts
at
shooting
with
a
revolver
illustration
taking
a
shot
at
jake
smith
hat
in
the
course
of
our
discussion
jake
smith
expressed
his
doubt
whether
any
member
of
our
party
except
hauser
who
is
an
expert
pistol
shot
is
sufficiently
skilled
in
the
use
of
the
revolver
to
hit
an
indian
at
even
a
close
range
and
he
offered
to
put
the
matter
to
a
test
by
setting
up
his
hat
at
a
distance
of
twenty
yards
for
the
boys
to
shoot
at
with
their
revolvers
without
a
rest
at
cents
a
shot
while
several
members
of
our
party
were
blazing
away
with
indifferent
success
with
the
result
that
jake
was
adding
to
his
exchequer
without
damage
to
his
hat
i
could
not
resist
the
inclination
to
quietly
drop
out
of
sight
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
where
from
my
place
of
concealment
i
sent
from
my
ballard
repeating
rifle
four
bullets
in
rapid
succession
through
the
hat
badly
riddling
it
jake
inquired
whose
revolver
is
it
that
makes
that
loud
report
he
did
not
discover
the
true
state
of
the
case
but
removed
the
target
with
the
ready
acknowledgment
that
there
were
members
of
our
party
whose
aim
with
a
revolver
was
more
accurate
than
he
had
thought
i
think
that
i
will
make
confession
to
him
in
a
few
days
i
now
wish
that
i
had
brought
with
me
an
extra
hat
my
own
is
not
large
enough
for
jake
head
notwithstanding
the
serious
problems
which
we
must
deal
with
in
making
this
journey
it
is
well
to
have
a
little
amusement
while
we
may
tuesday
august
last
night
was
the
first
that
we
were
on
guard
the
first
relief
was

everything
went
well
at
we
broke
camp
some
delay
occurring
in
packing
our
horses
lieutenant
doane
and
the
escort
went
ahead
and
we
did
not
again
see
them
until
we
reached
our
night
camp
we
traveled
down
trail
creek
and
over
a
spur
of
the
mountain
to
the
valley
of
the
yellowstone
which
we
followed
up
eight
miles
to
our
present
camp
along
on
our
right
in
passing
up
the
valley
was
a
vast
natural
pile
of
basaltic
rock
perpendicular
a
part
of
which
had
been
overthrown
showing
transverse
seams
in
the
rock
away
at
the
right
in
the
highest
range
bordering
the
valley
was
pyramid
mountain
itself
a
peak
and
further
up
the
range
was
a
long
ridge
covered
with
deep
snow
as
we
passed
pyramid
mountain
a
cloud
descended
upon
it
casting
its
gloomy
shadow
over
the
adjacent
peaks
and
bursting
in
a
grand
storm
these
magnificent
changes
in
mountain
scenery
occasioned
by
light
and
shade
during
one
of
these
terrific
tempests
with
all
the
incidental
accompaniments
of
thunder
lightning
rain
snow
and
hail
afford
the
most
exhibition
in
nature
as
i
write
another
grand
storm
which
does
not
extend
to
our
camp
has
broken
out
on
emigrant
peak
which
at
one
moment
is
completely
obscured
in
darkness
at
the
next
perhaps
brilliant
with
light
all
its
gorges
recesses
seams
and
cañons
illuminated
these
fade
away
into
dim
twilight
broken
by
a
terrific
flash
and
echoing
to
successive
peals
the
rattling
crags
among
leaps
the
live
thunder
in
innumerable
reverberations
on
the
left
of
the
valley
the
foot
hills
were
mottled
with
a
carpet
of
beautiful
verdure
and
towering
above
all
rose
peak
on
peak
of
the
mountains
we
saw
our
first
indians
as
we
descended
into
the
valley
of
the
yellowstone
they
came
down
from
the
east
side
of
the
valley
over
the
foot
hills
to
the
edge
of
the
plateau
overlooking
the
bottom
lands
of
the
river
and
there
conspicuously
displayed
themselves
for
a
time
to
engage
our
attention
as
we
passed
by
them
up
the
valley
they
moved
down
to
where
their
ponies
were
hobbled
two
of
our
party
hauser
and
stickney
had
dropped
behind
and
passed
towards
the
north
to
get
a
shot
at
an
antelope
and
when
they
came
up
they
reported
that
while
we
were
observing
the
indians
on
the
plateau
across
the
river
there
were
one
hundred
or
more
of
them
watching
us
from
behind
a
high
butte
as
our
passed
up
the
valley
as
soon
as
they
observed
hauser
and
stickney
coming
up
nearly
behind
them
they
wheeled
their
horses
and
disappeared
down
the
other
side
of
the
butte
b
this
early
admonition
of
our
exposure
to
hostile
attack
and
liability
to
be
robbed
of
everything
and
compelled
on
foot
and
without
provisions
to
retrace
our
steps
has
been
the
subject
of
discussion
in
our
camp
and
has
renewed
in
our
party
the
determination
to
abate
nothing
of
our
vigilance
and
keep
in
a
condition
of
constant

on
guard
valley
of
the
yellowstone
with
our
rifles
and
plenty
of
ammunition
we
can
stand
off
or
of
them
with
their
less
efficient
weapons
if
we
do
let
them
sneak
up
upon
us
in
the
night
if
we
encounter
more
than
that
number
then
what
the
odds
will
be
against
us
that
they
will
rub
us
out
as
jim
stuart
says
jake
smith
has
sent
the
first
demoralizing
shot
into
the
camp
by
announcing
that
he
does
think
there
is
any
necessity
for
standing
guard
jake
is
the
only
one
of
our
party
who
shows
some
sign
of
baldness
and
he
probably
thinks
that
his
own
scalp
is
not
worth
the
taking
by
the
indians
did
we
act
wisely
in
permitting
him
to
join
our
party
at
the
last
moment
before
leaving
helena
one
careless
man
no
less
than
one
who
is
easily
discouraged
by
difficulties
will
frequently
demoralize
an
entire
company
i
think
we
have
now
taken
all
possible
precautions
for
our
safety
but
our
numbers
are
few
and
for
me
to
say
that
i
am
not
in
hourly
dread
of
the
indians
when
they
appear
in
large
force
would
be
a
braggart
boast
everts
was
taken
sick
this
afternoon
all
day
we
have
had
a
cool
breeze
and
a
few
light
showers
clearing
off
from
time
to
time
revealing
the
mountains
opposite
us
covered
from
their
summits
half
way
down
with
the
newly
fallen
snow
and
light
clouds
floating
just
below
over
the
foot
hills
until
we
reached
the
open
valley
of
the
yellowstone
our
route
was
over
a
narrow
trail
from
which
the
stream
trail
creek
takes
its
name
the
mountains
opposite
the
point
where
we
entered
the
valley
are
rugged
grand
picturesque
and
immense
by
turns
and
colored
by
nature
with
a
thousand
gorgeous
hues
we
have
traveled
all
this
day
amid
this
stupendous
variety
of
landscape
until
we
have
at
length
reached
the
western
shore
of
that
vast
and
solitary
river
which
is
to
guide
us
to
the
theatre
of
our
explorations
from
the
lay
of
the
land
i
should
judge
that
our
camp
is
to
forty
miles
above
the
point
where
captain
william
clark
of
the
famous
lewis
and
clark
expedition
embarked
with
his
party
in
july
in
two
cottonwood
canoes
bound
together
with
buffalo
thongs
on
his
return
to
the
states
it
was
from
that
point
also
that
some
six
hundred
residents
of
montana
embarked
for
a
trip
to
the
states
in
flat
boats
in
the
autumn
of
c
we
learn
from
boteler
that
there
are
some
lodges
of
crow
indians
up
the
valley
d
wednesday
august
it
rained
nearly
all
of
last
night
but
lieutenant
doane
pitched
his
large
tent
which
was
sufficiently
capacious
to
accommodate
us
all
by
lying
heads
and
tails
and
we
were
very
comfortable
throughout
the
forenoon
we
had
occasional
showers
but
about
noon
it
cleared
away
and
after
getting
a
lunch
we
got
under
way
during
the
forenoon
some
of
the
escort
were
very
successful
in
fishing
for
trout
everts
was
not
well
enough
to
accompany
us
and
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
remain
at
boteler
ranch
and
that
we
would
move
about
twelve
miles
up
the
river
and
there
await
his
arrival
our
preparations
for
departure
being
completed
general
washburn
detailed
a
guard
of
four
men
to
accompany
the
pack
train
while
the
rest
of
the
party
rode
on
ahead
we
broke
camp
at
with
the
pack
train
and
moved
up
the
valley
at
about
six
miles
from
our
camp
we
crossed
a
spur
of
the
mountain
which
came
down
boldly
to
the
river
and
from
the
top
we
had
a
beautiful
view
of
the
valley
stretched
out
below
us
the
stream
fringed
with
a
thin
bordering
of
trees
the
foot
hills
rising
into
a
level
plateau
covered
with
rich
bunch
grass
and
towering
above
all
the
summits
of
the
distant
mountains
rising
majestically
seemingly
just
out
of
the
plateau
though
they
were
many
miles
away
above
us
the
valley
opened
out
wide
and
from
the
overlooking
rock
on
which
we
stood
we
could
see
the
long
train
of
pack
horses
winding
their
way
along
the
narrow
trail
the
whole
presenting
a
picturesque
scene
the
rock
on
which
we
stood
was
a
coarse
conglomerate
or
pudding
stone
five
miles
farther
on
we
crossed
a
small
stream
bordered
with
black
cherry
trees
many
of
the
smaller
ones
broken
down
by
bears
of
which
animal
we
found
many
signs
one
mile
farther
on
we
made
our
camp
about
a
mile
below
the
middle
cañon
we
have
antelope
rabbit
duck
grouse
and
the
finest
of
large
trout
for
supper
as
i
write
general
washburn
hedges
and
hauser
are
engaged
in
an
animated
discussion
of
the
differences
between
france
and
germany
and
the
probabilities
of
the
outcome
of
the
war
the
three
gentlemen
are
not
agreed
in
determining
where
the
responsibility
for
the
trouble
lies
and
i
fear
that
i
will
have
to
check
their
profanity
however
neither
washburn
nor
hedges
swears
thursday
august
last
night
was
very
cold
the
thermometer
marking
degrees
at
at
one
mile
of
travel
we
came
to
the
middle
cañon
which
we
passed
on
a
very
narrow
trail
running
over
a
high
spur
of
the
mountain
overlooking
the
river
which
at
this
point
is
forced
through
a
narrow
gorge
surging
and
boiling
and
tumbling
over
the
rocks
the
water
having
a
dark
green
color
after
passing
the
cañon
we
again
left
the
valley
passing
over
the
mountain
on
the
top
of
which
at
an
elevation
of
several
hundred
feet
above
the
river
is
a
beautiful
lake
descending
the
mountain
again
we
entered
the
valley
which
here
is
about
one
and
a
half
to
two
miles
wide
at
nineteen
miles
from
our
morning
camp
we
came
to
gardiner
river
at
the
mouth
of
which
we
camped
we
are
near
the
southern
boundary
of
montana
and
still
in
the
limestone
and
granite
formations
everts
came
into
camp
just
at
night
nearly
recovered
but
very
tired
from
his
long
and
tedious
ride
over
a
rugged
road
making
our
two
days
travel
in
one
we
passed
a
singular
formation
which
we
named
the
devil
slide
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
to
the
valley
a
distance
of
about
feet
the
trap
rock
projected
from
to
feet
the
intermediate
layers
of
friable
rock
having
been
washed
out
the
trap
formation
is
about
feet
wide
and
covered
with
stunted
pine
trees
opposite
our
camp
is
a
high
drift
formation
of
granite
boulders
gravel
and
clay
the
boulders
are
the
regular
gray
quincy
granite
and
those
in
the
middle
of
the
river
are
hollowed
out
by
the
action
of
the
water
into
many
curious
shapes
we
have
here
found
our
first
specimens
of
petrifactions
and
obsidian
or
volcanic
glass
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
back
of
our
camp
we
can
see
a
smoke
rising
from
another
peak
which
some
of
our
party
think
is
a
signal
from
one
band
of
the
indians
to
another
conveying
intelligence
of
our
progress
along
our
trail
of
are
plenty
of
indian
signs
and
marks
of
the
lodge
poles
dragging
in
the
sand
on
either
side
of
the
trail
e
jake
smith
stood
guard
last
night
or
ought
to
have
done
so
and
but
for
the
fact
that
gillette
was
also
on
guard
i
should
not
have
had
an
undisturbed
sleep
we
know
that
the
indians
are
near
us
and
sleep
is
more
refreshing
to
me
when
i
feel
assured
that
i
will
not
be
joined
in
my
slumbers
by
those
who
are
assigned
for
watchful
guard
duty
illustration
hauser
friday
august
for
some
reason
we
did
not
leave
camp
till
we
forded
gardiner
river
with
some
difficulty
several
of
our
pack
animals
being
nearly
carried
off
their
feet
by
the
torrent
we
passed
over
several
rocky
ridges
or
points
coming
down
from
the
mountain
and
at
one
and
a
half
miles
came
down
again
into
the
valley
which
one
of
our
party
called
the
valley
of
desolation
taking
the
trail
upon
the
left
we
followed
it
until
it
led
us
to
the
mouth
of
a
cañon
through
which
ran
an
old
indian
or
game
trail
which
was
hardly
discernible
and
had
evidently
been
long
abandoned
retracing
our
steps
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
taking
a
through
the
sage
brush
we
followed
another
trail
upon
our
right
up
through
a
steep
dry
coulee
from
the
head
of
the
coulee
we
went
through
fallen
timber
over
a
burnt
and
rocky
road
our
progress
being
very
slow
a
great
many
of
the
packs
came
off
our
horses
or
became
loosened
necessitating
frequent
haltings
for
their
readjustment
upon
the
summit
we
found
a
great
many
shells
descending
the
divide
we
found
upon
the
trail
the
carcass
of
an
antelope
which
the
advance
party
had
killed
and
which
we
packed
on
our
horses
and
carried
to
our
night
camp
in
the
morning
lieutenant
doane
and
one
of
his
men
together
with
everts
had
started
out
ahead
of
the
party
to
search
out
the
best
trail
at
we
arrived
at
antelope
creek
only
six
miles
from
our
morning
camp
where
we
concluded
to
halt
on
the
trail
which
we
were
following
there
were
no
tracks
except
those
of
unshod
ponies
and
as
our
horses
were
all
shod
it
was
evident
that
lieutenant
doane
and
the
advance
party
had
descended
the
mountain
by
some
other
trail
than
that
which
we
were
following
neither
were
there
any
marks
of
dragging
lodge
poles
there
are
seemingly
two
trails
across
the
mountain
a
circuitous
one
by
as
easy
a
grade
as
can
be
found
over
which
the
indians
send
their
families
with
their
heavily
laden
pack
horses
and
a
more
direct
though
more
difficult
route
which
the
war
parties
use
in
making
their
rapid
rides
this
last
is
the
one
we
have
taken
and
the
advance
party
has
doubtless
taken
the
other
our
camp
is
on
antelope
creek
about
five
miles
from
the
yellowstone
river
after
our
arrival
in
camp
in
company
with
stickney
and
gillette
i
made
a
scout
of
eight
or
ten
miles
through
the
country
east
of
our
trail
and
between
it
and
the
river
in
search
of
some
sign
of
lieutenant
doane
but
we
found
no
trace
of
him
parting
from
stickney
and
gillette
i
followed
down
the
stream
through
a
narrow
gorge
by
a
game
trail
hoping
if
i
could
reach
the
yellowstone
to
find
a
good
trail
along
its
banks
up
to
the
foot
of
the
grand
cañon
but
i
found
the
route
impracticable
for
the
passage
of
our
pack
train
after
supper
hauser
and
i
went
out
in
search
of
our
other
party
and
found
the
tracks
of
their
horses
which
we
followed
about
four
miles
to
the
brow
of
a
mountain
overlooking
the
country
for
miles
in
advance
of
us
here
we
remained
an
hour
firing
our
guns
as
a
signal
and
carefully
scanning
the
whole
country
with
our
field
glasses
we
could
discern
the
trail
for
many
miles
on
its
tortuous
course
but
could
see
no
sign
of
a
camp
or
of
horses
feeding
and
we
returned
to
our
camp
saturday
august
lieutenant
doane
and
those
who
were
with
him
did
not
return
to
camp
last
night
at
change
of
guard
gillette
pack
horse
became
alarmed
at
something
in
the
bushes
bordering
upon
the
creek
on
the
bank
of
which
he
was
tied
and
breaking
loose
dashed
through
the
camp
rousing
all
of
us
some
wild
animal
snake
fox
or
something
of
the
kind
was
probably
the
cause
of
the
alarm
in
its
flight
i
became
entangled
in
the
lariat
and
was
dragged
head
first
for
three
or
four
rods
my
head
striking
a
log
which
proved
to
be
very
rotten
and
offered
little
resistance
to
a
hard
head
and
did
me
very
little
damage
towards
morning
a
slight
shower
of
rain
fell
continuing
at
intervals
till
we
left
camp
about
the
pack
train
following
about
and
soon
struck
the
trail
of
lieutenant
doane
which
proved
to
be
the
route
traveled
by
the
indians
the
marks
of
their
lodge
poles
were
plainly
visible
at
about
four
miles
from
our
morning
camp
we
discovered
at
some
distance
ahead
of
us
what
first
appeared
to
be
a
young
elk
but
which
proved
to
be
a
colt
that
had
become
separated
from
the
camp
of
indians
to
which
it
belonged
we
think
the
indians
can
not
be
far
from
us
at
this
time
following
the
trail
up
the
ascent
leading
from
antelope
creek
we
entered
a
deep
cut
the
sides
of
which
rise
at
an
angle
of
degrees
and
are
covered
with
a
luxuriant
growth
of
grass
through
this
cut
we
ascended
by
a
grade
entirely
practicable
for
a
wagon
road
to
the
summit
of
the
divide
separating
the
waters
of
antelope
creek
from
those
of
f
creek
and
from
the
summit
descended
through
a
beautiful
gorge
to
a
small
tributary
of
the
yellowstone
a
distance
of
two
miles
dismounting
and
leading
our
horses
almost
the
entire
distance
the
descent
being
too
precipitous
for
the
rider
comfort
or
for
ease
to
the
horse
we
were
now
within
four
miles
of
f
creek
and
within
two
miles
of
the
yellowstone
on
the
right
of
the
trail
two
miles
farther
on
we
found
a
small
hot
sulphur
spring
the
water
of
which
was
at
a
temperature
a
little
below
the
boiling
point
which
at
this
elevation
is
about
degrees
ascending
a
high
ridge
we
had
a
commanding
view
of
a
basaltic
formation
of
palisades
about
thirty
feet
in
height
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
yellowstone
overlooking
a
stratum
of
cement
and
gravel
nearly
two
hundred
feet
thick
beneath
which
is
another
formation
of
the
basaltic
rock
and
beneath
this
another
body
of
cement
and
gravel
we
named
this
formation
column
rock
the
upper
formation
from
which
the
rock
takes
its
name
consists
of
basaltic
columns
about
thirty
feet
high
closely
touching
each
other
the
columns
being
from
three
to
five
feet
in
diameter
a
little
farther
on
we
descended
the
sides
of
the
cañon
through
which
runs
a
large
creek
we
crossed
this
creek
and
camped
on
the
south
side
our
camp
is
about
four
hundred
feet
in
elevation
above
the
yellowstone
which
is
not
more
than
two
miles
distant
the
creek
is
full
of
granite
boulders
varying
in
size
from
six
inches
to
ten
feet
in
diameter
general
washburn
was
on
guard
last
night
and
he
seems
somewhat
fatigued
hedges
has
improvised
a
writing
stool
from
a
sack
of
flour
and
i
have
appropriated
a
sack
of
beans
for
a
like
use
and
as
we
have
been
writing
there
has
been
a
lively
game
of
cards
played
near
my
left
side
which
hedges
who
has
just
closed
his
diary
says
is
a
game
of
poker
i
doubt
if
deacon
hedges
is
sufficiently
posted
in
the
game
to
know
to
a
certainty
that
poker
is
the
game
which
is
being
played
but
putting
what
hedges
tells
me
with
what
i
see
and
hear
i
find
that
these
infatuated
players
have
put
a
valuation
of
five
cents
per
bean
on
beans
that
did
not
cost
more
than
quart
in
helena
and
jake
smith
exhibits
a
marvelous
lack
of
veneration
for
his
kinswoman
by
referring
to
each
bean
as
he
places
it
before
him
upon
the
table
as
his
aunt
or
more
flippantly
his
auntie
walter
trumbull
has
been
styled
the
banker
and
he
says
that
at
the
commencement
of
the
game
he
sold
forty
of
these
beans
to
each
of
the
players
himself
included
in
all
at
five
cents
each
and
that
he
has
already
redeemed
the
entire
at
that
rate
and
now
jake
smith
has
a
cup
nearly
full
of
beans
and
is
demanding
of
trumbull
that
he
redeem
them
also
that
is
pay
five
cents
per
bean
for
the
contents
of
the
cup
trumbull
objects
jake
persists
reflecting
upon
their
disagreement
i
recall
that
about
an
hour
ago
jake
with
an
apologetic
excuse
me
disturbed
me
while
i
was
writing
and
untied
the
bean
sack
on
which
i
am
now
sitting
and
took
from
it
a

it
seems
to
me
that
a
game
of
cards
which
admits
of
such
latitude
as
this
with
a
practically
unlimited
draft
upon
outside
resources
is
hardly
fair
to
all
parties

especially
to
the

sunday
august
being
sunday
we
remained
all
day
in
our
camp
which
washburn
and
everts
have
named
camp
comfort
as
we
have
an
abundance
of
venison
and
trout
we
visited
the
falls
of
the
creek
the
waters
of
which
tumble
over
the
rocks
and
boulders
for
the
distance
of
yards
from
our
camp
and
then
fall
a
distance
of
feet
as
triangulated
by
hauser
stickney
ventured
to
the
verge
of
the
fall
and
with
a
stone
attached
to
a
strong
cord
measured
its
height
which
he
gives
as
feet
the
stream
in
its
descent
to
the
brink
of
the
fall
is
separated
into
half
a
dozen
distorted
channels
which
have
their
passage
through
the
cement
formation
working
it
into
spires
pinnacles
towers
and
many
other
capricious
objects
many
of
these
are
of
faultless
symmetry
resembling
the
minaret
of
a
mosque
others
are
so
grotesque
as
to
provoke
merriment
as
well
as
wonder
one
of
this
latter
character
we
named
the
devil
hoof
from
its
supposed
similarity
to
the
proverbial
foot
of
his
satanic
majesty
the
height
of
this
rock
from
its
base
is
about
fifty
feet

devil

the
friable
rock
forming
the
spires
and
towers
and
pinnacles
crumbles
away
under
a
slight
pressure
i
climbed
one
of
these
tall
spires
on
the
brink
of
the
chasm
overlooking
the
fall
and
from
the
top
had
a
beautiful
view
though
it
was
one
not
unmixed
with
terror
directly
beneath
my
feet
but
probably
about
one
hundred
feet
below
me
was
the
verge
of
the
fall
and
still
below
that
the
deep
gorge
through
which
the
creek
went
bounding
and
roaring
over
the
boulders
to
its
union
with
the
yellowstone
the
scenery
here
can
not
be
called
grand
or
magnificent
but
it
is
most
beautiful
and
picturesque
the
spires
are
from
to
feet
in
height
the
volume
of
water
is
about
six
or
eight
times
that
of
minnehaha
fall
and
i
think
that
a
month
ago
while
the
snows
were
still
melting
the
creek
could
not
easily
have
been
forded
the
route
to
the
foot
of
the
fall
is
by
a
well
worn
indian
trail
running
to
the
mouth
of
the
creek
over
boulders
and
fallen
pines
and
through
thickets
of
raspberry
bushes
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
on
the
yellowstone
is
a
hot
sulphur
spring
the
odor
from
which
is
perceptible
in
our
camp
at
the
base
of
the
fall
we
found
a
large
petrifaction
of
wood
imbedded
in
the
debris
of
the
falling
cement
and
slate
rock
there
are
several
sulphur
springs
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
three
of
them
boiling
others
nearly
as
hot
as
boiling
water
there
is
also
a
milky
white
sulphur
spring
within
one
yard
of
a
spring
the
temperature
of
which
is
little
below
the
boiling
point
is
a
sulphur
spring
with
water
nearly
as
cold
as
ice
water
or
not
more
than
ten
degrees
removed
from
it
i
went
around
and
almost
under
the
fall
or
as
far
as
the
rocks
gave
a
the
rising
spray
thoroughly
wetting
and
nearly
blinding
me
some
two
hundred
yards
below
the
fall
is
a
huge
granite
boulder
about
thirty
feet
in
diameter
where
did
it
come
from
in
camp
several
names
were
proposed
for
the
creek
and
fall
and
after
much
discussion
the
name
minaret
was
selected
later
this
evening
this
decision
has
been
reconsidered
and
we
have
decided
to
substitute
the
name
tower
for
minaret
and
call
it
tower
fall
g
general
washburn
rode
out
to
make
a
for
a
route
to
the
river
and
returned
about
in
the
afternoon
with
the
intelligence
that
from
the
summit
of
a
high
mountain
he
had
seen
yellowstone
lake
the
proposed
object
of
our
visit
and
with
his
compass
he
had
noted
its
direction
from
our
camp
this
intelligence
has
greatly
relieved
our
anxiety
concerning
the
course
we
are
to
pursue
and
has
quieted
the
dread
apprehensions
of
some
of
our
number
lest
we
become
inextricably
involved
in
the
wooded
labyrinth
by
which
we
are
surrounded
and
in
violation
of
our
agreement
that
we
would
not
give
the
name
of
any
member
of
our
party
to
any
object
of
interest
we
have
spontaneously
and
by
unanimous
vote
given
the
mountain
the
name
by
which
it
will
hereafter
and
forever
be
known
mount
washburn
in
addition
to
our
saddle
horses
and
pack
horses
we
have
another
animal
in
our
outfit
a
large
black
dog
of
seeming
little
intelligence
to
which
we
have
given
the
name
of
booby
he
is
owned
by
nute
one
of
our
colored
boys
who
avers
that
he
is
a
very
knowing
dog
and
will
prove
himself
so
before
our
journey
is
ended
the
poor
beast
is
becoming
and
his
sufferings
excite
our
sympathy
and
we
are
trying
to
devise
some
kind
of
shoe
or
moccasin
for
him
the
rest
in
camp
will
benefit
him
lieutenant
doane
is
suffering
greatly
with
a
felon
on
his
thumb
it
ought
to
be
opened
but
he
is
unwilling
to
submit
to
a
thorough
operation
his
sufferings
kept
him
awake
nearly
all
of
last
night
monday
august
we
broke
camp
about
leaving
the
trail
which
runs
down
to
the
mouth
of
the
creek
and
passed
over
a
succession
of
high
ridges
and
part
of
the
time
through
fallen
timber
the
trail
of
the
indians
leads
off
to
the
left
to
the
brink
of
the
yellowstone
which
it
follows
up
about
of
a
mile
and
then
crosses
to
the
east
side
hauser
gillette
stickney
trumbull
and
myself
rode
out
to
the
summit
of
mount
washburn
which
is
probably
the
highest
peak
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
having
an
aneroid
barometer
with
us
we
ascertained
the
elevation
of
the
mountain
to
be
about
feet
the
summit
is
about
feet
above
the
snow
line
descending
the
mountain
on
the
southwest
side
we
came
upon
the
trail
of
the
pack
train
which
we
followed
to
our
camp
at
the
head
of
a
small
stream
running
into
the
yellowstone
which
is
about
five
miles
distant
as
we
came
into
camp
a
black
bear
kindly
vacated
the
premises
after
supper
some
of
our
party
followed
down
the
creek
to
its
mouth
at
about
one
mile
below
our
camp
the
creek
runs
through
a
bed
of
volcanic
ashes
which
extends
for
a
hundred
yards
on
either
side
toiling
on
our
course
down
this
creek
to
the
river
we
came
suddenly
upon
a
basin
of
boiling
sulphur
springs
exhibiting
signs
of
activity
and
points
of
difference
so
wonderful
as
to
fully
absorb
our
curiosity
the
largest
of
these
about
twenty
feet
in
diameter
is
boiling
like
a
cauldron
throwing
water
and
fearful
volumes
of
sulphurous
vapor
higher
than
our
heads
its
color
is
a
disagreeable
greenish
yellow
the
central
spring
of
the
group
of
dark
leaden
hue
is
in
the
most
violent
agitation
its
convulsive
spasms
frequently
projecting
large
masses
of
water
to
the
height
of
seven
or
eight
feet
the
spring
lying
to
the
east
of
this
more
diabolical
in
appearance
filled
with
a
hot
brownish
substance
of
the
consistency
of
mucilage
is
in
constant
noisy
ebullition
emitting
fumes
of
villainous
odor
its
surface
is
covered
with
bubbles
which
are
constantly
rising
and
bursting
and
emitting
sulphurous
gases
from
various
parts
of
its
surface
its
appearance
has
suggested
the
name
which
hedges
has
given
of
springs
for
as
we
gazed
upon
the
infernal
mixture
and
inhaled
the
pungent
sickening
vapors
we
were
impressed
with
the
idea
that
this
was
a
most
perfect
realization
of
shakespeare
image
in
macbeth
it
needed
but
the
presence
of
hecate
and
her
weird
band
to
realize
that
horrible
creation
of
poetic
fancy
and
i
fancied
the
black
and
midnight
hags
concocting
a
charm
around
this
horrible
cauldron
we
ventured
near
enough
to
this
spring
to
dip
the
end
of
a
pine
pole
into
it
which
upon
removal
was
covered
an
eighth
of
an
inch
thick
with
sulphury
slime
there
are
five
large
springs
and
half
a
dozen
smaller
ones
in
this
basin
all
of
them
strongly
impregnated
with
sulphur
alum
and
arsenic
the
water
from
all
the
larger
springs
is
dark
brown
or
nearly
black
the
largest
spring
is
fifteen
to
eighteen
feet
in
diameter
and
the
water
boils
up
like
a
cauldron
from
to
inches
and
one
instinctively
draws
back
from
the
edge
as
the
hot
sulphur
steam
rises
around
him
another
of
the
larger
springs
is
intermittent
the
smaller
springs
are
farther
up
on
the
bank
than
the
larger
ones
the
deposit
of
sinter
bordering
one
of
them
with
the
emission
of
steam
and
smoke
combined
gives
it
a
resemblance
to
a
chimney
of
a
miner
cabin
around
them
all
is
an
incrustation
formed
from
the
bases
of
the
spring
deposits
arsenic
alum
sulphur
etc
this
incrustation
is
sufficiently
strong
in
many
places
to
bear
the
weight
of
a
man
but
more
frequently
it
gave
way
and
from
the
apertures
thus
created
hot
steam
issued
showing
it
to
be
dangerous
to
approach
the
edge
of
the
springs
and
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
i
obtained
specimens
of
the
incrustation
this
i
finally
accomplished
by
lying
at
full
length
upon
that
portion
of
the
incrustation
which
yielded
the
least
but
which
was
not
sufficiently
strong
to
bear
my
weight
while
i
stood
upright
and
at
imminent
risk
of
sinking
in
the
infernal
mixture
i
rolled
over
and
over
to
the
edge
of
the
opening
and
with
the
crust
slowly
bending
and
sinking
beneath
me
hurriedly
secured
the
coveted
prize
of
black
sulphur
and
rolled
back
to
a
place
of
safety
illustration
securing
a
specimen
at
springs
from
the
springs
to
the
mouth
of
the
creek
we
followed
along
the
bank
the
bed
or
bottom
being
too
rough
and
precipitous
for
us
to
travel
in
it
the
total
fall
in
the
creek
for
the
three
miles
being
about
fifteen
hundred
feet
standing
upon
the
high
point
at
the
junction
of
the
creek
with
the
yellowstone
one
first
gets
some
idea
of
the
depth
of
the
cañon
through
which
the
river
runs
from
this
height
the
sound
of
the
waters
of
the
yellowstone
tumbling
over
tremendous
rocks
and
boulders
could
not
be
heard
everything
around
us
mountains
valleys
cañon
and
trees
heights
and
depths
all
are
in
such
keeping
and
proportion
that
all
our
estimates
of
distances
are
far
below
the
real
truth
we
passed
the
mouth
of
river
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
yellowstone
it
was
again
jake
smith
turn
for
guard
duty
last
night
but
this
morning
jake
countenance
wore
a
peculiar
expression
which
indicated
that
he
possessed
some
knowledge
not
shared
by
the
rest
of
the
party
he
spoke
never
a
word
and
was
as
serene
as
a
methodist
minister
behind
four
aces
my
interpretation
of
this
serenity
is
that
his
guard
duty
did
not
deprive
him
of
much
sleep
when
it
comes
to
considering
the
question
of
danger
in
this
indian
country
jake
thinks
that
he
knows
more
than
the
veteran
jim
stuart
whom
we
expected
to
join
us
on
this
trip
and
who
has
given
us
some
salutary
words
of
caution
in
a
matter
in
which
the
safety
of
our
whole
party
is
involved
it
is
unfortunate
that
there
are
no
articles
of
war
to
aid
in
the
enforcement
of
discipline
in
faithful
guard
duty
tuesday
august
we
broke
camp
about
traveling
in
a
southerly
direction
over
the
hills
adjoining
our
camp
and
then
descended
the
ridge
in
a
southwesterly
direction
heading
off
several
ravines
till
we
came
into
a
small
valley
thence
we
crossed
over
a
succession
of
ridges
of
fallen
timber
to
a
creek
where
we
halted
about
ten
miles
from
our
morning
camp
and
about
a
mile
from
the
upper
fall
of
the
yellowstone
hedges
gave
the
name
cascade
creek
to
this
stream
when
we
left
our
camp
this
morning
at
springs
i
remarked
to
hedges
and
general
washburn
that
the
wonders
of
which
we
were
in
pursuit
had
not
disappointed
us
in
their
first
exhibitions
and
that
i
was
encouraged
in
the
faith
that
greater
curiosities
lay
before
us
we
believed
that
the
great
cataracts
of
the
yellowstone
were
within
two
days
or
at
most
three
days
travel
so
when
we
reached
cascade
creek
on
which
we
are
now
encamped
after
a
short
day
of
journeying
it
was
with
much
astonishment
as
well
as
delight
that
we
found
ourselves
in
the
immediate
presence
of
the
falls
their
roar
smothered
by
the
vast
depth
of
the
cañon
into
which
they
plunge
was
not
heard
until
they
were
before
us
with
remarkable
deliberation
we
unsaddled
and
lariated
our
horses
and
even
refreshed
ourselves
with
such
creature
comforts
as
our
larder
readily
afforded
before
we
deigned
a
survey
of
these
great
wonders
of
nature
on
our
walk
down
the
creek
to
the
river
struck
with
the
beauty
of
its
cascades
we
even
neglected
the
greater
to
admire
the
lesser
wonders
bushing
with
great
celerity
through
a
deep
defile
of
lava
and
obsidian
worn
into
caverns
and
fissures
the
stream
of
a
mile
from
its
debouchure
breaks
into
a
continuous
cascade
of
remarkable
beauty
consisting
of
a
fall
of
five
feet
succeeded
by
another
of
fifteen
into
a
grotto
formed
by
proximate
rocks
imperfectly
arching
it
whence
from
a
crystal
pool
of
unfathomable
depth
at
their
base
it
lingers
as
if
half
reluctant
to
continue
its
course
or
as
if
to
renew
its
power
and
then
glides
gracefully
over
a
descending
almost
perpendicular
ledge
veiling
the
rocks
for
the
distance
of
eighty
feet
hedges
gave
to
this
succession
of
cascades
the
name
crystal
fall
it
is
very
beautiful
but
the
broken
and
cavernous
gorge
through
which
it
passes
worn
into
a
thousand
fantastic
shapes
bearing
along
its
margin
the
tracks
of
grizzly
bears
and
lesser
wild
animals
scattered
throughout
with
huge
masses
of
obsidian
and
other
volcanic
matter
the
whole
suggestive
of
nothing
earthly
nor
heavenly
received
at
our
hands
and
not
inaptly
as
i
conceive
the
name
of
the
devil
den
i
presume
that
many
persons
will
question
the
taste
evinced
by
our
company
in
the
selection
of
names
for
the
various
objects
of
interest
we
have
thus
far
met
with
but
they
are
all
so
different
from
any
of
nature
works
that
we
have
ever
seen
or
heard
of
so
entirely
out
of
range
of
human
experience
and
withal
so
full
of
exhibitions
which
can
suggest
no
other
fancy
than
that
which
our
good
grandmothers
have
painted
on
our
boyish
imaginations
as
a
destined
future
abode
that
we
are
likely
almost
involuntarily
to
pursue
the
system
with
which
we
have
commenced
to
the
end
of
our
journey
a
similar
imagination
has
possessed
travelers
and
visitors
to
other
volcanic
regions
we
have
decided
to
remain
at
this
point
through
the
entire
day
and
examine
the
cañon
and
falls
from
the
brief
survey
of
the
cañon
i
was
enabled
to
make
before
darkness
set
in
i
am
impressed
with
its
awful
grandeur
and
i
realize
the
impossibility
of
giving
to
any
one
who
has
not
seen
a
gorge
similar
in
character
any
idea
of
it
illustration
cornelius

it
is
getting
late
and
it
is
already
past
our
usual
bedtime
and
jake
smith
is
calling
to
me
to
turn
in
and
give
him
a
chance
to
sleep
there
is
in
what
i
have
already
seen
so
much
of
novelty
to
fill
the
mind
and
burden
the
memory
that
unless
i
write
down
in
detail
the
events
of
each
day
and
indeed
almost
of
each
hour
as
it
passes
i
shall
not
be
able
to
prepare
for
publication
on
my
return
home
any
clear
or
satisfactory
account
of
these
wonders
so

go

will

burns

is
indolent

fond

think
that
he
resents
my
remark
to
him
the

that
he
could
burn
more

gather
less

any
man
i
ever
camped
with
he
has
dubbed
me
the
yellowstone
sharp
good
i
am
not
ashamed
to
have
the
title
lieutenant
doane
has
crawled
out
of
his
blankets
and
is
just
outside
the
tent
with
his
hand
and
immersed
in
water
nearly
as
cold
as
ice
i
am
afraid
that
will
set
in
if
he
does
not
consent
to
have
the
felon
lanced
wednesday
august
this
has
been
a
day
with
me
and
one
which
i
shall
not
soon
forget
for
my
mind
is
clogged
and
my
memory
confused
by
what
i
have
seen
general
washburn
and
hedges
are
sitting
near
me
writing
and
we
have
an
understanding
that
we
will
compare
our
notes
when
finished
we
are
all
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
and
wonder
at
what
we
have
seen
and
we
feel
that
we
have
been
near
the
very
presence
of
the
almighty
general
washburn
has
just
quoted
from
the
psalm
when
i
behold
the
work
of
thy
hands
what
is
man
that
thou
art
mindful
of
him
my
own
mind
is
so
confused
that
i
hardly
know
where
to
commence
in
making
a
clear
record
of
what
is
at
this
moment
floating
past
my
mental
vision
i
can
not
confine
myself
to
a
bare
description
of
the
falls
of
the
yellowstone
alone
for
these
two
great
cataracts
are
but
one
feature
in
a
scene
composed
of
so
many
of
the
elements
of
grandeur
and
sublimity
that
i
almost
despair
of
giving
to
those
who
on
our
return
home
will
listen
to
a
recital
of
our
adventures
the
faintest
conception
of
it
the
immense
cañon
or
gorge
of
rocks
through
which
the
river
descends
perhaps
more
than
the
falls
is
calculated
to
fill
the
observer
with
feelings
of
mingled
awe
and
terror
this
chasm
is
seemingly
about
thirty
miles
in
length
commencing
above
the
upper
fall
it
attains
a
depth
of
two
hundred
feet
where
that
takes
its
plunge
and
in
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
from
that
point
to
the
verge
of
the
lower
fall
it
rapidly
descends
with
the
river
between
walls
of
rock
nearly
six
hundred
feet
in
vertical
height
to
which
three
hundred
and
twenty
feet
are
added
by
the
fall
below
this
the
wall
lines
marked
by
the
descent
of
the
river
grow
in
height
with
incredible
distinctness
until
they
are
probably
two
thousand
feet
above
the
water
there
is
a
difference
of
nearly
three
thousand
feet
in
altitude
between
the
surface
of
the
river
at
the
upper
fall
and
the
foot
of
the
cañon
opposite
mount
washburn
the
cañon
must
be
more
than
half
a
vertical
mile
in
depth
as
it
is
impossible
to
explore
the
entire
cañon
we
are
unable
to
tell
whether
the
course
of
the
river
through
it
is
broken
by
other
and
larger
cataracts
than
the
two
we
have
seen
or
whether
its
continuous
descent
alone
has
produced
the
enormous
depth
to
which
it
has
attained
rumors
of
falls
a
thousand
feet
in
height
have
often
reached
us
before
we
made
this
visit
at
all
points
where
we
approached
the
edge
of
the
cañon
the
river
was
descending
with
fearful
momentum
through
it
and
the
rapids
and
foam
from
the
dizzy
summit
of
the
rock
overhanging
the
lower
fall
and
especially
from
points
farther
down
the
cañon
were
so
terrible
to
behold
that
none
of
our
company
could
venture
the
experiment
in
any
other
manner
than
by
lying
prone
upon
the
rock
to
gaze
into
its
awful
depths
depths
so
amazing
that
the
sound
of
the
rapids
in
their
course
over
immense
boulders
and
lashing
in
fury
the
base
of
the
rocks
on
which
we
were
lying
could
not
be
heard
the
stillness
is
horrible
and
the
solemn
grandeur
of
the
scene
surpasses
conception
you
feel
the
absence
of
sound
the
oppression
of
absolute
silence
down
down
down
you
see
the
river
attenuated
to
a
thread
if
you
could
only
hear
that
gurgling
river
lashing
with
puny
strength
the
massive
walls
that
imprison
it
and
hold
it
in
their
dismal
shadow
if
you
could
but
see
a
living
thing
in
the
depth
beneath
you
if
a
bird
would
but
fly
past
you
if
the
wind
would
move
any
object
in
that
awful
chasm
to
break
for
a
moment
the
solemn
silence
which
reigns
there
it
would
relieve
that
tension
of
the
nerves
which
the
scene
has
excited
and
with
a
grateful
heart
you
would
thank
god
that
he
had
permitted
you
to
gaze
unharmed
upon
this
majestic
display
of
his
handiwork
but
as
it
is
the
spirit
of
man
sympathizes
with
the
deep
gloom
of
the
scene
and
the
brain
reels
as
you
gaze
into
this
profound
and
solemn
solitude
illustration
grand
cañon
the
place
where
i
obtained
the
best
and
most
terrible
view
of
the
cañon
was
a
narrow
projecting
point
situated
two
or
three
miles
below
the
lower
fall
h
standing
there
or
rather
lying
there
for
greater
safety
i
thought
how
utterly
impossible
it
would
be
to
describe
to
another
the
sensations
inspired
by
such
a
presence
as
i
took
in
this
scene
i
realized
my
own
littleness
my
helplessness
my
dread
exposure
to
destruction
my
inability
to
cope
with
or
even
comprehend
the
mighty
architecture
of
nature
more
than
all
this
i
felt
as
never
before
my
entire
dependence
upon
that
almighty
power
who
had
wrought
these
wonders
a
sense
of
danger
lest
the
rock
should
crumble
away
almost
overpowered
me
my
knees
trembled
and
i
experienced
the
terror
which
causes
men
to
turn
pale
and
their
countenances
to
blanch
with
fear
and
i
recoiled
from
the
vision
i
had
seen
glad
to
feel
the
solid
earth
beneath
me
and
to
realize
the
assurance
of
returning
safety
the
scenery
surrounding
the
cañon
and
falls
on
both
banks
of
the
yellowstone
is
enlivened
by
all
the
hues
of
abundant
vegetation
the
approach
the
river
crowned
with
a
vesture
of
evergreen
pines
meadows
verdant
with
grasses
and
shrubbery
stretch
away
to
the
base
of
the
distant
mountains
which
rolling
into
ridges
rising
into
peaks
and
breaking
into
chains
are
defined
in
the
deepest
blue
upon
the
horizon
to
render
the
scene
still
more
imposing
remarkable
volcanic
deposits
wonderful
boiling
springs
jets
of
heated
vapor
large
collections
of
sulphur
immense
rocks
and
petrifications
abound
in
great
profusion
in
this
immediate
vicinity
the
river
is
filled
with
trout
and
bear
elk
deer
mountain
lions
and
lesser
game
roam
the
plains
forests
and
mountain
fastnesses
the
two
grand
falls
of
the
yellowstone
form
a
fitting
completion
to
this
stupendous
climax
of
wonders
they
impart
life
power
light
and
majesty
to
an
assemblage
of
elements
which
without
them
would
be
the
most
gloomy
and
horrible
solitude
in
nature
their
eternal
anthem
echoing
from
cañon
mountain
rock
and
woodland
thrills
you
with
delight
and
you
gaze
with
rapture
at
the
curtains
of
fleecy
foam
as
they
plunge
into
gulfs
enveloped
in
mist
and
spray
the
stillness
which
held
your
senses
spellbound
as
you
peered
into
the
dismal
depths
of
the
cañon
below
is
now
broken
by
the
uproar
of
waters
the
terror
it
inspired
is
superseded
by
admiration
and
astonishment
and
the
scene
late
so
painful
from
its
silence
and
gloom
is
now
animate
with
joy
and
revelry
the
upper
fall
as
determined
by
the
rude
means
of
measurement
at
our
command
is
one
hundred
and
fifteen
feet
in
height
the
river
approaches
it
through
a
passage
of
rocks
which
rise
one
hundred
feet
on
either
side
above
its
surface
until
within
half
a
mile
of
the
brink
of
the
fall
the
river
is
peaceful
and
unbroken
by
a
ripple
suddenly
as
if
aware
of
impending
danger
it
becomes
lashed
into
foam
circled
with
eddies
and
soon
leaps
into
fearful
rapids
the
rocky
jaws
confining
it
gradually
converge
as
it
approaches
the
edge
of
the
fall
bending
its
course
by
their
projections
and
apparently
crowding
back
the
water
which
struggles
and
leaps
against
their
bases
warring
with
its
bounds
in
the
impatience
of
restraint
and
madly
leaping
from
its
confines
a
liquid
emerald
wreathed
with
foam
into
the
abyss
beneath
the
sentinel
rocks
a
hundred
feet
asunder
could
easily
be
spanned
by
a
bridge
directly
over
and
in
front
of
the
fall
and
fancy
led
me
forward
to
no
distant
period
when
such
an
effort
of
airy
architecture
would
be
crowded
with
happy
gazers
from
all
portions
of
our
country
a
quarter
of
the
way
between
the
verge
and
the
base
of
the
fall
a
rocky
table
projects
from
the
west
bank
in
front
of
and
almost
within
reaching
distance
of
it
furnishing
a
point
of
observation
where
the
finest
view
can
be
obtained
in
order
to
get
a
more
perfect
view
of
the
cataract
hedges
and
i
made
our
way
down
to
this
table
rock
where
we
sat
for
a
long
time
as
from
this
spot
we
looked
up
at
the
descending
waters
we
insensibly
felt
that
the
slightest
protrusion
in
them
would
hurl
us
backwards
into
the
gulf
below
a
thousand
arrows
of
foam
apparently
at
leaped
from
the
verge
and
passed
rapidly
down
the
sheet
but
as
the
view
grew
upon
us
and
we
comprehended
the
power
majesty
and
beauty
of
the
scene
we
became
insensible
to
danger
and
gave
ourselves
up
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
it
very
beautiful
as
is
this
fall
it
is
greatly
excelled
in
grandeur
and
magnificence
by
the
cataract
half
a
mile
below
it
where
the
river
takes
another
perpendicular
plunge
of
three
hundred
and
twenty
feet
into
the
most
gloomy
cavern
that
ever
received
so
majestic
a
visitant
between
the
two
falls
the
river
though
bordered
by
lofty
precipices
expands
in
width
and
flows
gently
over
a
nearly
level
surface
until
its
near
approach
to
the
verge
here
a
sudden
convergence
in
the
rocks
compresses
its
channel
and
with
a
gurgling
choking
struggle
it
leaps
with
a
single
bound
sheer
from
an
even
level
shelf
into
the
tremendous
chasm
the
sheet
could
not
be
more
perfect
if
wrought
by
art
the
almighty
has
vouchsafed
no
grander
scene
to
human
eyes
every
object
that
meets
the
vision
increases
its
sublimity
there
is
a
majestic
harmony
in
the
whole
which
i
have
never
seen
before
in
grandest
works
the
fall
itself
takes
its
leap
between
the
jaws
of
rocks
whose
vertical
height
above
it
is
more
than
six
hundred
feet
and
more
than
nine
hundred
feet
above
the
chasm
into
which
it
falls
long
before
it
reaches
the
base
it
is
enveloped
in
spray
which
is
woven
by
the
sun
rays
into
bows
radiant
with
all
the
colors
of
the
prism
and
arching
the
face
of
the
cataract
with
their
glories
five
hundred
feet
below
the
edge
of
the
cañon
and
one
hundred
and
sixty
feet
above
the
verge
of
the
cataract
and
overlooking
the
deep
gorge
beneath
on
the
flattened
summit
of
a
projecting
crag
i
lay
with
my
face
turned
into
the
boiling
chasm
and
with
a
stone
suspended
by
a
large
cord
measured
its
profoundest
depths
three
times
in
its
descent
the
cord
was
parted
by
abrasion
but
at
last
securing
the
weight
with
a
leather
band
i
was
enabled
to
ascertain
by
a
measurement
which
i
think
quite
exact
the
height
of
the
fall
it
is
a
little
more
than
three
hundred
and
twenty
feet
while
the
perpendicular
wall
down
which
i
suspended
the
weight
was
five
hundred
and
ten
feet
illustration
lower
fall
of
the
yellowstone
looking
down
from
this
lofty
eminence
through
the
cañon
below
the
falls
the
scene
is
full
of
grandeur
the
descent
of
the
river
for
more
than
a
mile
is
marked
by
continuous
cascades
varying
in
height
from
five
to
twenty
feet
and
huge
rapids
breaking
over
the
rocks
and
lashing
with
foam
the
precipitous
sides
of
the
gorge
a
similar
descent
through
the
entire
cañon
thirty
miles
is
probable
as
in
no
other
way
except
by
distinct
cataracts
of
enormous
height
can
the
difference
in
altitude
between
this
point
and
its
outlet
be
explained
the
colors
of
the
rock
which
is
shaly
in
character
are
variegated
with
yellow
gray
and
brown
and
the
action
of
the
water
in
its
rapid
passage
down
the
sides
of
the
cañon
has
worn
the
fragments
of
shale
into
countless
capricious
forms
jets
of
steam
issue
from
the
sides
of
the
cañon
at
frequent
intervals
marking
the
presence
of
thermal
springs
and
active
volcanic
forces
the
evidence
of
a
recession
of
the
river
through
the
cañon
is
designated
by
the
ridges
apparent
on
its
sides
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
at
no
distant
day
the
lower
fall
will
become
blended
by
this
process
with
the
upper
forming
a
single
cataract
nearly
five
hundred
feet
in
height
there
are
but
few
places
where
the
sides
of
the

can
be
descended

left

so
fascinating

spot
quoting

i
yes
this
stupendous
display

will
be
to
me
a
joy
forever
it
lingers
in
my
memory
like
the
faintly
defined
outlines
of
a
dream
i
can
scarcely
realize
that
in
the
unbroken
solitude
of
this
majestic
range
of
rocks
away
from
civilization
and
almost
inaccessible
to
human
approach
the
almighty
has
placed
so
many
of
the
most
wonderful
and
magnificent
objects
of
his
creation
and
that
i
am
to
be
one
of
the
few
first
to
bring
them
to
the
notice
of
the
world
truly
has
it
been
said
that
we
live
to
learn
how
little
may
be
known
and
of
what
we
see
how
much
surpasses
comprehension

we
did
not
break

till
nearly
ten
this
morning
the
crossing

at
its
head
and
coming
into
the

about
two
miles
above
the

the
more
direct

shorter
by
one
and
a
half
miles
runs
along
the
bank
of
the
river
if
we
had
not
decided
last
night
that
we
would
move
on
i
think
that
every
member
of
the
party
would
have
been
glad
to
stay
another
day
at
the
cañon
and
falls
i
will
however
except
out
of
the
number
our
comrade

the
afternoon
of
our
arrival
at
the
cañon

before
yesterday
after
half
an
hour
of
inspection
of
the
falls
and
cañon
he
said
well
boys
i
have
seen
all
there
is
and
i
am
ready
to
move
on
however
the
perceptible
decline
in
our
larder
and
the
uncertainty
of
the
time
to
be
occupied
in
further
explorations
forbid
more
than
these
two
days
stay
at
the
falls
and
cañon
the
sun
this
morning
shone
brightly
and
its
rays
were
reflected
upon
the
sides
of
the
dismal
cañon
so
dark
and
gray
and
still
enlivening
and
brightening
it
has
been
warm
and
nature
this
morning
seemed
determined
that
our
last
look
should
be
the
brightest
for
the
beauties
of
the
entire
landscape
invited
us
to
make
a
longer
stay
and
we
lingered
till
the
last
moment
that
the
final
impression
might
not
be
lost
pursuing
our
journey
at
two
miles
above
the
falls
we
crossed
a
small
stream
which
we
named
alum
creek
as
it
is
strongly
impregnated
with

illustration
gillette
six
miles
above
the
upper
fall
we
entered
upon
a
region
remarkable
for
the
number
and
variety
of
its
hot
springs
and
craters
the
principal
spring
and
the
one
that
first
meets
the
eye
as
you
approach
from
the
north
is
a
hot
sulphur
spring
of
oval
shape
the
water
of
which
is
constantly
boiling
and
is
thrown
up
to
the
height
of
from
three
to
seven
feet
its
two
diameters
are
about
twelve
feet
and
twenty
feet
and
it
has
an
indented
border
of
seemingly
pure
sulphur
about
two
feet
wide
and
extending
down
into
the
spring
or
cauldron
to
the
edge
of
the
water
which
at
the
time
of
our
visit
if
it
had
been
at
rest
would
have
been
fifteen
or
eighteen
inches
below
the
rim
of
the
spring
this
spring
is
situated
at
the
base
of
a
low
mountain
and
the
gentle
slope
below
and
around
the
spring
for
the
distance
of
two
hundred
or
three
hundred
feet
is
covered
to
the
depth
of
from
three
to
ten
inches
with
the
sulphurous
deposit
from
the
overflow
of
the
spring
the
moistened
bed
of
a
rivulet
leading
from
the
edge
of
the
spring
down
inside
through
this
deposit
showed
us
that
the
spring
had
but
recently
been
overflowing
farther
along
the
base
of
this
mountain
is
a
sulphurous
cavern
about
twenty
feet
deep
and
seven
or
eight
feet
in
diameter
at
its
mouth
out
of
which
the
steam
is
thrown
in
jets
with
a
sound
resembling
the
puffing
of
a
when
laboring
over
a
and
with
as
much
uniformity
and
intonation
as
if
emitted
by
a
engine
from
hundreds
of
fissures
in
the
adjoining
mountain
from
base
to
summit
issue
hot
sulphur
vapors
the
apertures
through
which
they
escape
being
encased
in
thick
incrustations
of
sulphur
which
in
many
instances
is
perfectly
pure
there
are
nearby
a
number
of
small
sulphur
springs
not
especially
remarkable
in
appearance
about
one
hundred
yards
from
these
springs
is
a
large
hot
spring
of
irregular
shape
but
averaging
forty
feet
long
by
wide
the
water
of
which
is
of
a
dark
muddy
color
still
farther
on
are
twenty
or
thirty
springs
of
boiling
mud
of
different
degrees
of
consistency
and
color
and
of
sizes
varying
from
two
to
eight
feet
in
diameter
and
of
depths
below
the
surface
varying
from
three
to
eight
feet
the
mud
in
these
springs
is
in
most
cases
a
little
thinner
than
mortar
prepared
for
plastering
and
as
it
is
thrown
up
from
one
to
two
feet
i
can
liken
its
appearance
to
nothing
so
much
as
indian
meal
hasty
pudding
when
the
process
of
boiling
is
nearly
completed
except
that
the
puffing
bloated
bubbles
are
greatly
magnified
being
from
a
few
inches
to
two
feet
in
diameter
in
some
of
the
springs
the
mud
is
of
dark
brown
color
in
others
nearly
pink
and
in
one
it
was
almost
yellow
springs
four
or
five
feet
in
diameter
and
not
over
six
feet
apart
have
no
connection
one
with
another
either
above
or
beneath
the
surface
the
mud
in
them
being
of
different
colors
in
some
instances
there
is
a
difference
of
three
feet
in
the
height
to
which
the
mud
in
adjoining
springs
attains
there
may
be
in
some
instances
two
or
more
springs
which
receive
their
supply
of
mud
and
their
underground
pressure
from
the
same
general
source
but
these
instances
are
rare
nor
can
we
determine
positively
that
such
is
the
case
this
mud
having
been
worked
over
and
over
for
many
years
is
as
soft
as
the
finest
pigments
all
of
these
springs
are
embraced
within
a
circle
the
radius
of
which
is
from
a
thousand
to
twelve
hundred
feet
and
the
whole
of
this
surface
seems
to
be
a
smothered
crater
covered
over
with
an
incrustation
of
sufficient
strength
and
thickness
to
bear
usually
a
very
heavy
weight
but
which
in
several
instances
yielded
and
even
broke
through
under
the
weight
of
our
horses
as
we
rode
over
it
we
quickly
dismounted
and
as
we
were
making
some
examinations
the
crust
broke
through
several
times
in
some
thin
places
through
which
vapor
was
issuing
under
the
whole
of
this
incrustation
the
hottest
fires
seem
to
be
raging
and
the
heat
issuing
from
the
vents
or
from
the
crevices
caused
from
the
breaking
in
of
the
surface
is
too
intense
to
be
borne
by
the
gloved
hand
for
an
instant
surrounding
the
natural
vents
are
deposits
of
pure
sulphur
portions
of
which
in
many
instances
we
broke
off
and
after
allowing
them
to
cool
brought
them
away
with
us
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
overlooking
the
large
sulphur
spring
is
a
small
living
crater
about
six
inches
in
diameter
out
of
which
issue
hot
vapor
and
smoke
on
the
slope
adjoining
the
mud
spring
is
another
crater
of
irregular
shape
but
embracing
about
one
hundred
square
inches
out
of
which
issues
hot
vapor
the
rocks
adjoining
changing
color
under
the
intense
heat
with
every
breath
blown
upon
them
the
tramp
of
our
horses
feet
as
we
rode
over
the
incrustation
at
the
base
of
the
mountain
returned
a
hollow
sound
yet
while
some
of
our
party
were
not
disposed
to
venture
upon
it
with
their
horses
still
i
think
with
care
in
selecting
a
route
there
is
very
little
danger
in
riding
over
it
on
the
mountain
large
quantities
of
sulphur
formed
by
the
condensation
of
the
vapor
issuing
from
the
crevices
now
closed
but
once
in
activity
in
the
incrusted
covering
have
been
deposited
and
we
collected
many
specimens
of
pure
and
crystallized
sulphur
thousands
of
pounds
of
pure
and
nearly
pure
sulphur
are
now
lying
on
the
top
and
sides
of
the
mountain
all
of
which
can
be
easily
gathered
with
the
aid
of
a
spade
to
detach
it
from
the
mountain
side
incrustations
to
which
it
adheres
in
the
process
of
condensation
we
gave
to
this
mountain
the
name
crater
hill
five
miles
further
on
we
camped
near
the
mud
geyser
our
course
has
been
for
the
greater
part
over
a
level
valley
which
was
plainly
visible
from
the
top
of
mount
washburn
the
water
of
the
river
at
this
point
is
strongly
impregnated
with
the
mineral
bases
of
the
springs
surrounding
our
camp
and
that
empty
into
the
river
above
it
friday
september
we
have
occupied
ourselves
in
examining
the
springs
and
other
wonders
at
this
point
at
the
base
of
the
adjoining
our
camp
are
three
large
springs
of
thick
boiling
mud
the
largest
of
which
resembles
an
immense
cauldron
it
is
about
thirty
feet
in
diameter
bordered
by
a
rim
several
feet
wide
upon
which
one
can
stand
within
reach
of
the
boiling
mass
of
mud
the
surface
of
which
is
four
or
five
feet
below
the
rim
enclosing
it
the
rim
being
a
little
raised
above
the
surrounding
level
some
twelve
or
fifteen
rods
from
this
spring
are
two
other
springs
from
ten
to
twelve
feet
in
diameter
near
by
is
a
hot
not
boiling
spring
of
sulphur
fifteen
to
eighteen
feet
in
diameter
too
hot
to
bathe
in
from
these
we
passed
over
the
timbered
hill
at
the
base
of
which
these
springs
are
situated
in
the
timber
along
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
near
its
summit
and
immediately
under
the
living
trees
the
hot
sulphur
vapor
and
steam
issue
from
several
fissures
or
craters
showing
that
the
hottest
fires
are
raging
at
some
point
beneath
the
surface
crust
which
in
a
great
many
places
gives
forth
a
hollow
sound
as
we
pass
over
it
through
a
little
coulee
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
runs
a
small
stream
of
greenish
water
which
issues
from
a
small
cavern
the
mouth
of
which
is
about
five
feet
high
and
the
same
dimension
in
width
from
the
mouth
the
roof
of
the
cavern
descends
at
an
angle
of
about
fifteen
degrees
till
at
the
distance
of
twenty
feet
from
the
entrance
it
joins
the
surface
of
the
water
the
bottom
of
the
cavern
under
the
water
seems
to
descend
at
about
the
same
angle
but
as
the
water
is
in
constant
ebullition
we
can
not
determine
this
fact
accurately
the
water
is
thrown
out
in
regular
spasmodic
jets
the
pulsations
occurring
once
in
ten
or
twelve
seconds
the
sides
and
mouth
of
this
cavern
are
covered
with
a
dark
green
deposit
some
of
which
we
have
taken
with
us
for
analysis
about
two
hundred
yards
farther
on
is
another
geyser
the
flow
of
which
occurs
about
every
six
hours
and
when
the
crater
is
full
the
diameter
of
the
surface
is
about
fourteen
feet
the
sides
of
the
crater
being
of
an
irregular
funnelshape
and
descending
at
an
angle
of
about
degrees
at
the
lowest
point
at
which
we
saw
the
water
it
was
about
seven
feet
in
diameter
on
the
surface
one
or
another
of
our
party
watched
the
gradual
rise
of
the
water
for
four
or
five
hours
the
boiling
commenced
when
the
water
had
risen
half
way
to
the
surface
occasionally
breaking
forth
with
great
violence
when
the
water
had
reached
its
full
height
in
the
basin
the
stream
was
thrown
up
with
great
force
to
a
height
of
from
twenty
to
thirty
feet
the
column
being
from
seven
to
ten
feet
in
diameter
at
the
midway
height
of
the
column
from
bottom
to
top
the
water
was
of
a
dark
lead
color
and
those
portions
of
the
sides
of
the
crater
that
were
overflowed
and
then
exposed
by
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
water
were
covered
with
stalagmites
formed
by
the
deposit
from
the
geyser
while
surveying
these
wonders
our
ears
were
constantly
saluted
by
dull
thundering
booming
sounds
resembling
the
reports
of
distant
artillery
as
we
approached
the
spot
whence
they
proceeded
the
ground
beneath
us
shook
and
trembled
as
from
successive
shocks
of
an
earthquake
ascending
a
small
hillock
the
cause
of
the
uproar
was
found
to
be
a
mud
volcano
the
greatest
marvel
we
have
yet
met
with
it
is
about
midway
up
a
gentle
slope
above
which
on
the
lower
side
its
crater
thirty
feet
in
diameter
rises
to
a
height
of
about
feet
dense
masses
of
steam
issue
with
explosive
force
from
this
crater
into
whose
tapering
mouth
as
they
are
momentarily
dispelled
by
the
wind
we
can
see
at
a
depth
of
about
forty
feet
the
regurgitating
contents
the
explosions
are
not
uniform
in
force
or
time
varying
from
three
to
eight
seconds
and
occasionally
with
perfect
regularity
occurring
every
five
seconds
they
are
very
distinctly
heard
at
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
and
the
massive
jets
of
vapor
which
accompany
them
burst
forth
like
the
smoke
of
burning
gunpowder
some
of
these
pulsations
are
much
more
violent
than
others
but
each
one
is
accompanied
by
the
discharge
of
an
immense
volume
of
steam
which
at
once
shuts
off
all
view
of
the
inside
of
the
crater
but
sometimes
during
the
few
seconds
intervening
between
the
pulsations
or
when
a
breeze
for
a
moment
carries
the
steam
to
one
side
of
the
crater
we
can
see
to
the
depth
of
thirty
feet
into
the
volcano
but
can
not
often
discover
the
boiling
mud
though
occasionally
when
there
occurs
an
unusually
violent
spasm
or
concussion
a
mass
of
mud
as
large
in
bulk
as
a
hogshead
is
thrown
up
as
high
as
our
heads
emitting
blinding
clouds
of
steam
in
all
directions
and
crowding
all
observers
back
from
the
edge
of
the
crater
we
were
led
to
believe
that
this
volcano
has
not
been
long
in
existence
but
that
it
burst
forth
the
present
summer
but
a
few
months
ago
the
green
leaves
and
the
limbs
of
the
surrounding
forest
trees
are
covered
with
fresh
clay
or
mud
as
is
also
the
newly
grown
grass
for
the
distance
of
feet
from
the
crater
on
the
top
branches
of
some
of
the
trees
near
by
trees
feet
high
we
found
particles
of
dried
mud
that
had
fallen
upon
the
high
branches
in
their
descent
just
after
this
first
outburst
which
must
have
thrown
the
contents
of
the
volcano
as
high
as
or
feet
hauser
whose
experience
as
an
engineer
and
with
projectile
forces
entitles
his
opinion
to
credit
estimates
from
the
particles
of
mud
upon
the
high
trees
and
the
distance
to
which
they
were
thrown
that
the
mud
had
been
thrown
in
this
explosion
to
the
height
of
between
and
feet
by
actual
measurement
we
found
particles
of
this
mud
feet
from
the
edge
of
the
crater
we
did
not
dare
to
stand
upon
the
leeward
side
of
the
crater
and
withstand
the
force
of
the
steam
and
hedges
having
ventured
too
near
the
rim
on
that
side
endangered
his
life
by
his
temerity
and
was
thrown
violently
down
the
exterior
side
of
the
crater
by
the
force
of
the
volume
of
steam
emitted
during
one
of
these
fearful
convulsions
general
washburn
and
i
who
saw
him
fall
were
greatly
concerned
lest
while
regaining
his
feet
being
blinded
by
the
steam
and
not
knowing
in
which
direction
to
turn
he
should
fall
into
the
crater
between
the
volcano
the
mud
geyser
and
the
cavern
spring
are
a
number
of
hot
sulphur
and
mud
springs
of
sizes
varying
from
two
to
twenty
feet
in
diameter
and
many
openings
or
crevices
from
which
issue
hot
vapor
or
steam
the
mouths
of
which
are
covered
with
sulphur
deposits
or
other
incrustations
from
the
mud
volcano
we
moved
up
the
valley
about
four
miles
to
our
camp
on
the
river
passing
several
mud
puffs
on
the
way
one
of
the
soldiers
brought
in
a
large
string
of
river
trout
but
the
water
of
the
river
is
strongly
impregnated
with
the
overflow
from
springs
near
its
bank
and
is
not
palatable
some
of
our
party
who
have
drank
the
water
are
feeling
nauseated
others
think
that
their
illness
is
caused
by
partaking
too
freely
of
one
of
the
luxuries
of
our
larder
canned
peaches
i
assuaged
my
thirst
with
the
peaches
and
have
not
partaken
of
the
water
and
there
is
no
one
in
our
camp
in
finer
condition
than
i
am
lieutenant
doane
felon
has
caused
him
great
suffering
and
i
have
appealed
to
him
to
allow
me
to
lance
it
i
have
for
many
years
carried
a
lancet
in
my
pocketbook
but
i
find
that
i
have
inadvertently
left
it
at
home
so
all
this
day
while
on
horseback
i
have
been
preparing
for
the
surgical
operation
by
sharpening
my
penknife
on
the
leathern
pommel
of
my
saddle
as
i
rode
along
i
have
in
my
seamless
sack
a
few
simple
medicines
including
a
vial
of
chloroform
lieutenant
doane
has
almost
agreed
to
let
me
open
the
felon
provided
i
put
him
to
sleep
with
the
chloroform
but
i
feel
that
i
am
too
much
of
a
novice
in
the
business
to
administer
it
however
i
have
told
him
that
i
would
do
so
if
he
demanded
it
our
elevation
is
about
feet
above
sea
level
saturday
september
this
morning
general
washburn
and
i
left
camp
immediately
after
breakfast
and
returned
four
miles
on
our
track
of
september
to
crater
hill
and
the
mud
springs
for
the
purpose
of
making
farther
examinations
we
found
the
sulphur
boiling
spring
to
be
full
to
overflowing
the
water
running
down
the
inclined
surface
of
the
crust
in
two
different
directions
it
was
also
boiling
with
greater
force
than
it
was
when
we
first
saw
it
the
water
being
occasionally
thrown
up
to
the
height
of
ten
feet
about
or
yards
from
this
spring
we
found
what
we
had
not
before
discovered
a
boiling
spring
of
tartaric
acid
in
solution
with
deposits
around
the
edge
of
the
spring
of
which
we
gathered
a
considerable
quantity
in
the
basin
where
we
had
found
so
many
mud
springs
we
found
a
hot
boiling
spring
containing
a
substance
of
deep
yellow
color
the
precise
nature
of
which
we
could
not
readily
ascertain
we
accordingly
brought
away
some
of
it
in
a
bottle
as
is
our
usual
custom
in
such
cases
of
uncertainty
and
we
will
have
an
analysis
of
it
made
on
our
return
home
in
the
same
basin
we
also
found
some
specimens
of
black
lava
a
half
mile
south
of
these
springs
we
found
an
alum
spring
yielding
but
little
water
and
surrounded
with
beautiful
alum
crystals
from
its
border
we
obtained
a
great
many
curiously
shaped
deposits
of
alum
slightly
impregnated
with
iron
the
border
of
this
spring
below
the
surface
had
been
undermined
in
many
places
by
the
violent
boiling
of
the
water
to
the
distance
of
several
feet
from
the
margin
so
that
it
was
unsafe
to
stand
near
the
edge
of
the
spring
this
however
i
did
not
at
first
perceive
and
as
i
was
unconcernedly
passing
by
the
spring
my
weight
made
the
border
suddenly
slough
off
beneath
my
feet
general
washburn
noticed
the
sudden
cracking
of
the
incrustation
before
i
did
and
i
was
aroused
to
a
sense
of
my
peril
by
his
shout
of
alarm
and
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
fall
suddenly
backwards
at
full
length
upon
the
sound
crust
whence
with
my
feet
and
legs
extended
over
the
spring
i
rolled
to
a
place
of
safety
but
for
general
washburn
shout
of
alarm
in
another
instant
i
would
have
been
precipitated
into
this
boiling
pool
of
alum
we
endeavored
to
sound
the
depth
of
this
spring
with
a
pole
feet
long
but
we
found
no
bottom
everything
around
us
air
earth
water
is
impregnated
with
sulphur
we
feel
it
in
every
drop
of
water
we
drink
and
in
every
breath
of
air
we
inhale
our
silver
watches
have
turned
to
the
color
of
poor
brass
tarnished
general
washburn
and
i
again
visited
the
mud
vulcano
i
especially
desired
to
see
it
again
for
the
one
especial
purpose
among
others
of
a
general
nature
of
assuring
myself
that
the
notes
made
in
my
diary
a
few
days
ago
are
not
exaggerated
no
they
are
not
the
sensations
inspired
in
me
on
again
witnessing
its
convulsions
and
the
dense
clouds
of
vapor
expelled
in
rapid
succession
from
its
crater
amid
the
jarring
of
the
earth
and
the
ominous
intonations
from
beneath
were
those
of
mingled
dread
and
wonder
at
war
with
all
former
experience
it
was
so
novel
so
unnaturally
natural
that
i
feel
while
now
writing
and
thinking
of
it
as
if
my
own
senses
might
have
deceived
me
with
a
mere
figment
of
the
imagination
but
it
is
not
so
the
wonder
than
which
this
continent
teeming
with
nature
grandest
exhibitions
contains
nothing
more
marvelous
still
stands
amid
the
solitary
fastnesses
of
the
yellowstone
to
excite
the
astonishment
of
the
thousands
who
in
coming
years
shall
visit
that
remarkable
locality
j
returning
to
the
camp
we
had
left
in
the
morning
we
found
the
train
had
crossed
the
river
and
we
forded
at
the
same
place
visiting
however
on
our
way
another
large
cauldron
of
boiling
mud
lying
nearly
opposite
our
camp
soon
after
fording
the
river
we
discovered
some
evidence
that
trappers
had
long
ago
visited
this
region
here
we
found
that
the
earth
had
been
thrown
up
two
feet
high
presenting
an
angle
to
the
river
quite
ingeniously
concealed
by
willows
and
forming
a
sort
of
from
which
a
hunter
without
disclosing
his
hiding
place
could
bring
down
swans
geese
ducks
pelicans
and
even
the
furred
animals
that
made
their
homes
along
the
river
bank
we
followed
the
trail
of
the
advance
party
along
the
bank
of
the
river
and
most
of
the
way
through
a
dense
forest
of
pine
timber
and
over
a
broad
swampy
lowland
when
we
came
into
their
camp
on
the
yellowstone
lake
two
miles
from
where
it
empties
into
the
river
and
about
ten
miles
from
our
morning
camp
we
passed
brimstone
basin
on
our
left
and
saw
jets
of
steam
rising
from
the
hills
back
of
it
from
all
appearances
the
yellowstone
can
be
forded
at
almost
any
point
between
the
rapids
just
above
the
upper
fall
and
the
lake
unless
there
are
quicksands
and
crevices
which
must
be
avoided
yellowstone
lake
as
seen
from
our
camp
seems
to
me
to
be
the
most
beautiful
body
of
water
in
the
world
in
front
of
our
camp
it
has
a
wide
sandy
beach
like
that
of
the
ocean
which
extends
for
miles
and
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
save
that
occasionally
there
is
to
be
found
a
sharp
projection
of
rocks
the
overlooking
bench
rises
from
the
edge
about
eight
feet
forming
a
bank
of
sand
or
natural
levee
which
serves
to
prevent
the
overflow
of
the
land
adjoining
which
when
the
lake
is
receiving
the
water
from
the
mountain
streams
that
empty
into
it
while
the
snows
are
melting
is
several
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
lake
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
within
three
or
four
miles
of
our
camp
are
to
be
found
specimens
of
sandstone
resembling
clay
of
sizes
varying
from
that
of
a
walnut
to
a
flour
barrel
and
of
every
odd
shape
imaginable
fire
and
water
have
been
at
work
here
together
fire
to
throw
out
the
deposit
in
a
rough
shape
and
water
to
polish
it
from
our
camp
we
can
see
several
islands
from
five
to
ten
miles
distant
in
a
direct
line
two
of
the
three
tetons
which
are
so
plainly
visible
to
travelers
going
to
montana
from
eagle
rock
bridge
on
snake
river
and
which
are
such
and
prominent
landmarks
on
that
stage
route
we
notice
in
the
direction
of
south
degrees
west
from
our
camp
we
shall
be
nearer
to
them
on
our
journey
around
the
lake
sunday
september
this
morning
at
breakfast
time
lieutenant
doane
was
sleeping
soundly
and
snoring
sonorously
and
we
decided
that
we
would
not
waken
him
but
would
remain
in
camp
till
the
afternoon
and
perhaps
until
morning
walter
trumbull
suggested
that
a
proper
deference
to
jake
smith
religious
sentiments
ought
to
be
a
sufficient
reason
for
not
traveling
on
sunday
whereupon
jake
immediately
exclaimed
if
we
going
to
remain
in
camp
let
have
a
game
of
draw
last
evening
lieutenant
doane
sufferings
were
so
intense
that
general
washburn
and
i
insisted
that
he
submit
to
an
operation
and
have
the
felon
opened
and
he
consented
provided
i
would
administer
chloroform
preparations
were
accordingly
made
after
supper
a
box
containing
army
cartridges
was
improvised
as
an
operating
table
and
i
engaged
bean
one
of
our
packers
and
hedges
as
assistant
surgeons
hedges
was
to
take
his
position
at
doarte
elbow
and
was
to
watch
my
motion
as
i
thrust
in
the
knife
blade
and
hold
the
elbow
and
firmly
to
prevent
any
involuntary
drawing
back
of
the
arm
by
lieutenant
doane
at
the
critical
moment
when
doane
was
told
that
we
were
ready
he
asked
where
is
the
chloroform
i
replied
that
i
had
never
administered
it
and
that
after
thinking
the
matter
over
i
was
afraid
to
assume
the
responsibility
of
giving
it
he
swallowed
his
disappointment
and
turned
his
thumb
over
on
the
cartridge
box
with
the
nail
down
hedges
and
bean
were
on
hand
to
steady
the
arm
and
before
one
could
say
jack
robinson
i
had
inserted
the
point
of
my
penknife
thrusting
it
down
to
the
bone
and
had
ripped
it
out
to
the
end
of
the
thumb
doane
gave
one
shriek
as
the
released
corruption
flew
out
in
all
directions
upon
surgeon
and
assistants
and
then
with
a
broad
smile
on
his
face
he
exclaimed
that
was
elegant
we
then
applied
a
poultice
of
bread
and
water
which
we
renewed
a
half
hour
later
and
doane
at
about
eight
last
night
dropped
off
into
a
seemingly
peaceful
sleep
which
has
been
continuous
up
to
the
time
of
this
writing
two
k
evening
of
september
i
have
been
glad
to
have
this
rest
for
with
the
time
spent
in
writing
up
a
detailed
diary
in
addition
to
the
work
about
camp
i
have
been
putting
in
about
sixteen
hours
work
each
day
so
this
afternoon
a
nap
of
two
or
three
hours
was
a
pleasant
rest
i
strolled
for
a
long
distance
down
the
shore
the
sand
of
which
abounds
in
small
crystals
which
some
of
our
party
think
may
possess
some
value
craters
emitting
steam
through
the
water
are
frequently
seen
beneath
the
surface
at
a
distance
of
from
forty
to
fifty
feet
from
its
margin
the
water
in
which
is
very
hot
while
that
of
the
lake
surrounding
them
i
found
to
be
too
cool
for
a
pleasant
bath
in
some
places
the
lake
water
is
strongly
impregnated
with
sulphur
one
crater
emits
a
jet
of
steam
with
a
hissing
noise
as
loud
as
that
usually
heard
at
the
blowing
off
of
the
safety
valve
of
a
in
the
clear
light
of
the
setting
sun
we
can
see
the
three
tetons
in
a
southwesterly
direction
illustration
grand
teton
some
member
of
our
party
has
asked
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
teton
given
to
these
mountains
l
lieutenant
doane
says
it
is
a
french
word
signifying
woman
breast
and
that
it
was
given
to
these
mountains
by
the
early
french
explorers
because
of
their
peculiar
shape
i
think
that
the
man
who
gave
them
this
name
must
have
seen
them
from
a
great
distance
for
as
we
approach
them
the
graceful
curvilinear
lines
which
obtained
for
them
this
delicate
appellation
appear
angular
and
ragged
from
our
present
point
of
view
the
name
seems
a
misnomer
if
there
were
twelve
of
them
instead
of
three
they
might
better
be
called
the
titans
to
illustrate
their
relation
to
the
surrounding
country
he
indeed
must
have
been
of
a
most
susceptible
nature
and
i
would
fain
believe
long
a
dweller
amid
these
solitudes
who
could
trace
in
these
cold
and
barren
peaks
any
resemblance
to
the
gentle
bosom
of
woman
monday
september
lieutenant
doane
continued
to
sleep
all
last
night
making
a
hours
nap
and
after
dressing
his
thumb
and
taking
an
observation
to
determine
our
elevation
which
we
found
to
be
feet
above
the
ocean
we
broke
camp
at
nine
after
the
train
had
got
under
way
i
asked
hedges
to
remain
behind
and
assist
me
in
measuring
by
a
rude
system
of
triangulation
the
distance
across
the
lake
as
well
as
to
the
tetons
but
owing
to
the
difficulty
we
encountered
in
laying
out
a
base
line
of
sufficient
length
we
abandoned
the
scheme
after
some
two
hours
of
useless
labor
illustration
slate

point
slate
cup
leg
and
foot
following
the
trail
of
the
advance
party
we
traveled
along
the
lake
beach
for
about
six
miles
passing
a
number
of
small
hot
sulphur
springs
and
lukewarm
sulphur
ponds
and
three
hot
steam
jets
surrounded
by
sulphur
incrustations
after
six
miles
we
left
the
beach
and
traveled
on
the
plateau
overlooking
the
lake
this
plateau
was
covered
with
a
luxuriant
growth
of
standing
pine
and
a
great
deal
of
fallen
timber
through
which
at
times
considerable
difficulty
was
experienced
in
passing
a
little
way
from
the
trail
is
an
alkaline
spring
about
six
feet
in
diameter
we
came
to
camp
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
after
having
marched
fifteen
miles
in
a
southerly
direction
we
have
a
most
beautiful
view
of
the
lake
from
our
camp
yesterday
it
lay
before
us
calm
and
unruffled
save
by
the
waves
which
gently
broke
upon
the
shore
the
winds
lash
it
into
a
raging
sea
covering
its
surface
with
foam
while
the
sparkling
sand
along
the
shore
seems
to
form
for
it
a
jeweled
setting
and
the
long
promontories
stretching
out
into
it
with
their
dense
covering
of
pines
lend
a
charming
feature
to
the
scene
water
never
seemed
so
beautiful
before
waves
four
feet
high
are
rolling
in
and
there
appear
to
be
six
or
seven
large
islands
but
we
can
not
be
certain
about
this
number
until
we
reach
the
south
shore
from
this
point
we
can
not
tell
whether
the
wooded
hills
before
us
are
islands
or
promontories
on
the
shore
are
to
be
found
large
numbers
of
carnelians
or
crystallized
quartz
agates
specimens
of
petrified
wood
and
lava
pebbles
or
globules
we
have
found
also
many
curious
objects
of
slate
formation
resembling
cups
discs
and
two
well
formed
resemblances
of
a
leg
and
foot
and
many
other
curious
objects
which
nature
in
her
most
capricious
mood
has
scattered
over
this
watery
solitude
all
these
seem
to
be
the
joint
production
of
fire
and
water
the
fire
forming
and
baking
them
and
the
water
polishing
them
we
called
this
place
curiosity
point
if
mount
washington
were
set
in
the
lake
its
summit
would
be
two
thousand
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
water
a
conference
of
the
party
was
held
to
decide
whether
we
would
continue
our
journey
around
the
lake
or
retrace
our
steps
and
pass
along
the
north
side
of
the
lake
over
to
the
madison
by
a
vote
of
six
to
three
we
have
decided
to
go
around
the
lake
hauser
voted
in
favor
of
returning
by
way
of
the
north
side
my
vote
was
cast
for
going
around
the
lake
as
we
passed
along
the
shore
we
could
see
the
steam
rising
from
a
large
group
of
hot
springs
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
lake
bordering
on
what
seems
to
be
the
most
westerly
bay
or
estuary
m
we
will
have
an
opportunity
to
examine
them
at
short
range
when
we
have
completed
our
journey
around
the
lake
tuesday
september
we
broke
camp
at
ten
thirty
this
morning
bearing
well
to
the
southeast
for
an
hour
and
then
turning
nearly
due
south
our
trail
running
through
the
woods
and
for
a
large
part
of
our
route
throughout
the
day
through
fallen
timber
which
greatly
impeded
our
progress
we
did
not
make
over
ten
miles
in
our
day
travel
frequently
we
were
obliged
to
leave
the
trail
running
through
the
woods
and
return
to
the
lake
and
follow
the
beach
for
some
distance
we
passed
along
the
base
of
a
brimstone
basin
the
mountains
forming
a
half
way
around
it
the
lake
completing
the
circle
in
company
with
lieutenant
doane
i
went
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
which
for
the
distance
of
three
or
four
miles
and
about
half
way
to
the
summit
is
covered
with
what
appears
to
be
sulphate
of
lime
and
flowers
of
sulphur
mixed
exhalations
are
rising
from
all
parts
of
the
ground
at
times
the
odor
of
brimstone
being
quite
strong
but
the
volcanic
action
in
this
vicinity
is
evidently
decreasing
about
half
way
up
the
deposit
on
the
mountain
side
a
number
of
small
rivulets
take
their
rise
having
sulphur
in
solution
and
farther
down
the
mountain
and
near
the
base
are
the
dry
beds
of
several
streams
from
ten
to
twenty
feet
in
width
which
bear
evidence
of
having
at
some
time
been
full
to
the
banks
two
or
three
feet
deep
with
sulphur
water
the
small
streams
now
running
are
warm
the
side
of
the
mountain
over
which
we
rode
seems
for
the
most
part
to
be
hollow
giving
forth
a
rumbling
sound
beneath
the
feet
as
we
rode
upon
the
crust
which
is
very
strong
in
no
instance
did
it
give
way
as
did
the
crust
at
crater
hill
under
which
the
fires
were
raging
though
the
incrustation
appears
to
be
very
similar
abounding
in
vents
and
fissures
and
emitting
suffocating
exhalations
of
sulphur
vapor
on
the
sides
of
the
mountain
were
old
fissures
surrounded
by
rusty
looking
sulphur
incrustations
now
nearly
washed
away
the
whole
mountain
gives
evidence
of
having
been
a
long
time
ago
in
just
the
same
condition
of
conflagration
as
that
in
which
we
found
crater
hill
but
all
outward
trace
of
fire
has
now
disappeared
save
what
is
found
in
the
warm
water
of
the
small
streams
running
down
the
sides
our
course
for
the
past
two
days
has
been
in
nearly
a
direction
or
about
parallel
with
the
wind
river
mountains
we
have
seen
an
abundance
of
the
tracks
of
elk
and
bears
and
occasionally
the
track
of
a
mountain
lion
wednesday
september
last
night
when
all
but
the
guards
were
asleep
we
were
startled
by
a
mountain
lion
shrill
scream
sounding
so
like
the
human
voice
that
for
a
moment
i
was
deceived
by
it
into
believing
that
some
traveler
in
distress
was
hailing
our
camp
the
stream
near
the
bank
of
which
our
camp
lay
flows
into
the
southeast
arm
of
yellowstone
lake
and
for
which
the
name
upper
yellowstone
has
been
suggested
by
some
of
our
party
but
lieutenant
doane
says
that
he
thinks
he
has
seen
on
an
old
map
the
name
bridger
given
to
some
body
of
water
near
the
yellowstone
we
tried
to
cross
the
river
near
its
mouth
but
found
the
mud
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
in
the
bottom
lands
adjoining
too
deep
our
horses
miring
down
to
their
bellies
in
accordance
with
plans
agreed
upon
last
night
general
washburn
and
a
few
of
the
party
started
out
this
morning
in
advance
of
the
others
to
search
for
a
practicable
crossing
of
the
river
and
marshes
leaving
the
pack
train
in
camp
in
company
with
lieutenant
doane
i
went
out
upon
a
reconnaissance
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
elevation
of
the
mountains
opposite
our
camp
as
well
as
the
shape
of
the
lake
as
far
as
we
could
see
the
shore
and
also
to
determine
as
far
as
possible
our
locality
and
the
best
line
of
travel
to
follow
in
passing
around
the
lake
there
is
just
enough
excitement
attending
these
scouting
expeditions
to
make
them
a
real
pleasure
overbalancing
the
labor
attendant
upon
them
there
is
very
little
probability
that
any
large
band
of
indians
will
be
met
with
on
this
side
of
the
lake
owing
to
the
superstitions
which
originate
in
the
volcanic
forces
here
found
we
followed
along
the
high
bank
adjacent
to
the
bottom
through
which
the
river
runs
in
a
direction
a
little
south
of
east
for
the
distance
of
about
three
miles
when
we
entered
a
heavily
timbered
ravine
which
we
followed
through
the
underbrush
for
some
three
miles
being
frequently
obliged
to
dismount
and
lead
our
horses
over
the
projecting
rocks
or
plunging
through
bushes
and
fallen
timber
at
the
end
of
two
hours
we
reached
a
point
in
the
ascent
where
we
could
no
longer
ride
in
safety
nor
could
our
horses
climb
the
mountain
side
with
the
weight
of
our
bodies
on
their
backs
dismounting
we
took
the
bridle
reins
in
our
hands
and
for
the
space
of
an
hour
we
led
our
horses
up
the
steep
mountain
side
when
we
again
mounted
and
slowly
climbed
on
our
way
occasionally
stopping
to
give
our
horses
a
chance
to
breathe
arriving
at
the
limit
of
timber
and
of
vegetation
we
tied
our
horses
and
then
commenced
the
ascent
of
the
steepest
part
of
the
mountain
over
the
broken
granite
great
care
being
necessary
to
avoid
sliding
down
the
mountain
side
with
the
loose
granite
the
ascent
occupied
us
a
little
more
than
four
hours
and
all
along
the
mountain
side
even
to
near
the
summit
we
saw
the
tracks
of
mountain
sheep
the
view
from
the
summit
of
this
mountain
for
wild
and
rugged
grandeur
is
surpassed
by
none
i
ever
before
saw
the
yellowstone
basin
and
the
wind
river
mountains
were
spread
out
before
us
like
a
map
on
the
south
the
eye
followed
the
source
of
the
yellowstone
above
the
lake
until
miles
away
it
was
lost
in
an
immense
cañon
beyond
which
two
immense
jets
of
vapor
rose
to
a
height
of
probably
three
hundred
feet
indicating
that
there
were
other
and
perhaps
greater
wonders
than
those
embraced
in
our
prescribed
limit
of
exploration
on
the
north
the
outlet
of
the
lake
and
the
steam
from
the
mud
geyser
and
mud
volcano
were
distinctly
visible
while
on
the
southeast
the
view
followed
to
the
horizon
a
succession
of
lofty
peaks
and
ridges
at
least
thirty
miles
in
width
whose
jagged
slopes
were
filled
with
yawning
caverns
recesses
and
beetling
precipices
some
hundreds
and
some
thousands
of
feet
in
height
this
is
the
range
which
captain
raynolds
approaching
from
the
east
found
impassable
while
on
his
exploring
tour
to
the
yellowstone
in
the
year
i
shall
upon
my
return
home
read
captain
raynolds
report
with
renewed
interest
n
the
mountain
on
which
we
stood
was
the
most
westerly
peak
of
a
range
which
in
long
extended
volume
swept
to
the
southeastern
horizon
exhibiting
a
continuous
elevation
more
than
thirty
miles
in
width
its
central
line
broken
into
countless
points
knobs
glens
and
defiles
all
on
the
most
colossal
scale
of
grandeur
and
magnificence
outside
of
these
on
either
border
along
the
entire
range
lofty
peaks
rose
at
intervals
seemingly
vying
with
each
other
in
the
varied
splendors
they
presented
to
the
beholder
the
scene
was
full
of
majesty
the
valley
at
the
base
of
this
range
was
dotted
with
small
lakes
lakes
abound
everywhere
in
the
valleys
on
the
mountains
and
farther
down
on
their
slopes
at
all
elevations
the
appearance
of
the
whole
range
was
suggestive
of
the
existence
ages
since
of
a
high
plateau
on
a
level
with
these
peaks
which
seemed
to
be
all
of
the
same
elevation
which
by
the
action
of
the
water
had
been
cut
down
in
the
intervals
between
the
peaks
into
deep
gorges
and
cañons
the
sides
of
the
mountains
formed
in
many
places
a
perpendicular
wall
from
to
feet
in
height
this
range
of
mountains
has
a
marvelous
history
as
it
is
the
loftiest
so
it
is
probably
the
most
remarkable
lateral
ridge
of
the
rocky
range
in
the
expedition
sent
across
the
continent
by
astor
in
under
command
of
captain
wilson
hunt
that
gentleman
met
with
the
first
serious
obstacle
to
his
progress
at
the
eastern
base
of
this
range
after
numerous
efforts
to
scale
it
he
turned
away
and
followed
the
valley
of
snake
river
encountering
the
most
discouraging
disasters
until
he
arrived
at
astoria
o
i
have
read
somewhere
i
think
in
washington
irving
astoria
or
bonneville
adventures
that
the
indians
regard
this
ridge
of
mountains
as
the
crest
of
the
world
and
that
among
the
blackfeet
there
is
a
fable
that
he
who
attains
its
summit
catches
a
view
of
the
land
of
souls
and
beholds
the
happy
hunting
grounds
spread
out
below
him
brightening
with
the
abodes
of
the
free
and
generous
spirits
lieutenant
doane
and
i
were
somewhat
fatigued
with
our
climb
of
four
hours
duration
and
we
refreshed
ourselves
with
such
creature
comforts
as
we
found
on
the
summit
but
although
we
attained
the
crest
we
did
not
discern
any
free
and
generous
spirit
save
that
which
we
saw
through
a
glass
darkly
at
the
point
where
we
left
our
horses
there
was
on
the
east
slope
of
the
mountain
a
body
of
snow
the
surface
of
which
was
nearly
horizontal
and
the
outer
edge
of
which
was
thirty
feet
in
perpendicular
height
this
body
of
snow
is
perpetual
at
this
point
the
elevation
as
indicated
by
our
aneroid
barometer
was

at
the
summit
it
was

which
was

the
descent
occupied
an
hour
and
a
quarter
when
we
struck
the
trail
of
the
pack
train
near
the
base
of
the
mountain
which
we
followed
until
we
found
three
poles
placed
in
the
form
of
a
tripod
the
longer
pole
pointing
to
the
right
to
indicate
that
at
this
point
the
party
had
changed
its
course

we
descended
the
bank
bordering
the
valley
and
traversed
the
bottom

to
the
river
which
we
forded
at
a
point
where
it
was
about
ninety
feet
wide
and
three
feet
deep
with
a
current
of
about
six
miles
an
hour
this
was
about
six
or
seven
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
we
followed
the
trail
of
the
advance
party
through
a
beautiful
pine
forest
free
from
underbrush
for
the
distance
of
two
miles
passing
two
beautiful
lakes
by
this
time
night
had
overtaken
us
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
we
could
follow
the
trail
the
tracks
of
the
horses
shoes
which
were
our
sole
guide
being
hardly
discernible
but
we
pressed
on
following
the
dark
serpentine
line
of
freshly
disturbed
earth
till
it
turned
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
where
we
followed
it
for
upwards
of
a
mile
fearing
lest
we
were
not
upon
the
right
trail
we
dismounted
and
placing
our
faces
close
to
the
ground
examined
it
carefully
but
could
not
discover
the
impression
of
a
single
horseshoe
gathering
a
few
dry
branches
of
pine
we
kindled
a
fire
upon
the
trail
when
we
discovered
that
we
had
been
following
from
the
base
of
the
mountain
the
trail
of
a
band
of
elk
that
had
crossed
the
line
of
travel
of
the

a
point
near
the

prospect
for

on
the
mountain
without
blankets
or

seemed
now
very
good
but
we
retraced
our
steps
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
on
reaching
the
base
of
the
mountain
struck
out
for
the
lake
resolving
to
follow
the
beach
trusting
that
our
party
had
made
their
camp
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
in
which
case
we
should
find
them
but
if
camped
at
any
considerable
distance
from
the
shore
we
should
not

ride
over
fallen
timber
and
through
morass
for
the
distance
of
about
two
miles
to
the
shore
of

lake
was
probably
performed
more
skillfully
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
than
if
we
had
seen
the
obstacles
in
our
path
and
as
we
rounded

beach

a
little
over
a
mile

welcome

of
our
comrades

we
arrived
within
hailing
distance

gave
a
loud
halloo
and
the
ready
response
by
a
dozen
sympathetic
voices
of
our
showed
that
our
own
anxiety
had
been
shared
by
them

camp
is
on
the
westerly
side
of
the
most
southeasterly

made
an

on

could
from
points
on

with

but
these
have
been
unsatisfactory

have
lacked

both
expressed
their

i
made
from

just
told

accidentally

upon

freely
expressed
their
joy

easy
prey

instinctive
duty

while
putting

in
order
and

animated
discussion
took
place
concerning
a
proper
disposition
of
the

were
to
be

spot
where
washburn

had
last
seen

we
traced
her
into
a
dense
thicket
which
owing
to
the

the
animal
from
sheer
exhaustion
would
always
be
lagging
behind
the
others
of
the
herd
from
the
start
and
especially
during
our
journey
through
the
forest
this
pony
by
his
acrobatic
performances
and
mishaps
has
furnished
much
amusement
for
us
all
progress
could
only
be
accomplished
by
leaping
our
animals
over
the
fallen
trunks
of
trees
our
little
broncho
with
all
the
spirit
necessary
lacks
oftentimes
the
power
to
scale
the
tree
trunks
as
a
consequence
he
is
frequently
found
resting
upon
his
midriff
with
his
fore
and
hind
feet
suspended
over
the
opposite
sides
of
some
huge
log
the
spirit
indeed
is
willing
but
the
flesh
is
weak
he
has
an
ambitious
spirit
which
is
exceeded
only
by
his
patience
he
has
had
many
mishaps
any
one
of
which
would
have
permanently
disabled
a
larger
animal
and
we
have
dubbed
him
little
invulnerable
one
of
the
soldiers
of
our
escort
private
moore
has
made
a
sketch
of
him
as
he
appeared
lying
across
a
log
of
which
i
am
to
have
a
copy
illustration
little
invulnerable
i
growled
at
hauser
and
scolded
him
a
little
in
camp
because
of
some
exasperating
action
of
his
i
here
record
the
fact
without
going
into
details
i
think
that
i
must
try
to
be
more
patient
but
i
am
feeling
somewhat
the
fatigue
of
our
journey
however
there
is
something
to
be
said
on
the
other
hand
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
one
of
the
party
better
able
to
bear
its
labors
and
anxieties
than
i
and
therefore
i
should
be
the
last
man
to
lose
my
patience
i
know
of
nothing
that
can
try
one
patience
more
than
a
trip
of
any
considerable
length
by
wagon
train
or
pack
train
through
an
uninhabited
region
and
the
most
amiable
of
our
race
can
not
pass
this
ordeal
entirely
unscathed
persons
who
are
not
blessed
with
uncommon
equanimity
never
get
through
such
a
journey
without
frequent
explosions
of
temper
and
seldom
without
violence
even
education
gentle
training
and
the
sharpest
of
mental
discipline
do
not
always
so
effectually
subdue
the
passions
that
they
may
not
be
aroused
into
unwonted
fury
during
a
long
journey
through
a
country
filled
with
obstructions
philosophy
has
never
found
a
fitter
subject
for
its
exercise
than
that
afforded
by
the
journey
we
are
now
making
which
obliges
the
members
of
our
party
to
strive
to
relieve
each
other
burdens
friday
september
last
night
there
occurred
an
incident
which
i
would
gladly
blot
from
these
pages
but
a
faithful
record
of
all
the
events
of
camp
life
in
connection
with
this
expedition
demands
that
i
omit
nothing
of
interest
nor
set
down
aught
in
malice
hedges
and
i
were
on
guard
during
the
last
relief
of
the
night
which
extends
from
the
wee
sma
hours
ayont
the
twal
to
daybreak
the
night
was
wearing
on
when
hedges
being
tempted
of
one
of
the
devils
which
doubtless
roam
around
this
sulphurous
region
or
that
perhaps
followed
lieutenant
doane
and
myself
down
from
that
high
mountain
apart
where
the
spirits
roam
asked
me
if
i
was
hungry
i
replied
that
such
had
been
my
normal
condition
ever
since
our
larder
had
perceptibly
declined
hedges
then
suggested
that
as
there
was
no
food
already
cooked
in
the
camp
we
take
each
a
wing
of
one
of
the
partridges
and
broil
it
over
our
small
fire
it
was
a
beautiful
thought
as
judge
bradford
of
colorado
used
to
say
from
the
bench
when
some
knotty
legal
problem
relating
to
a
case
he
was
trying
had
been
solved
and
was
speedily
acted
upon
by
both
of
us
but
i
was
disappointed
in
finding
so
little
meat
on
a
partridge
wing
and
believed
that
hedges
would
have
chosen
a
leg
instead
of
a
wing
if
he
had
pondered
a
moment
so
i
remedied
the
omission
and
as
a
result
each
roasted
a
leg
of
the
bird
soon
increase
of
appetite
grew
by
what
it
fed
on
and
the
breast
of
the
bird
was
soon
on
the
broiler
in
the
meantime
our
consciences
were
not
idle
and
we
were
pricked
in
our
hearts
the
result
was
that
we
had
a
vision
of
the
disappointment
of
our
comrades
as
each
should
receive
at
our
morning
breakfast
his
small
allotment
of
but
one
partridge
distributed
among
so
many
and
it
did
not
take
us
long
to
send
the
remaining
bird
to
join
its
mate
taking
into
consideration
the
welfare
of
our
comrades
it
seemed
the
best
thing
for
us
to
do
and
we
debated
between
ourselves
whether
the
birds
would
be
missed
in
the
morning
hedges
taking
the
affirmative
and
i
the
negative
side
of
the
question
this
morning
when
our
breakfast
was
well
nigh
finished
hauser
asked
newt
the
head
cook
why
he
had
not
prepared
the
partridges
for
breakfast
newt
answered
that
when
he
opened
the
pan
this
morning
the
birds
had
done
gone
and
he
thought
that
booby
the
dog
had
eaten
them
whereupon
hauser
pelted
the
dog
with
stones
and
sticks
hedges
and
i
nearly
bursting
with
our
suppressed
laughter
quietly
exchanged
glances
across
the
table
and
the
situation
became
quite
intense
for
us
as
we
strove
to
restrain
our
risibles
while
listening
to
the
comments
of
the
party
on
the
utter
worthlessness
of
that
dog
booby
suddenly
the
camp
was
electrified
by
gillette
asking
who
was
on
guard
last
night
that
it
said
one
that
where
the
birds
went
said
another
this
denouement
was
too
much
for
hedges
and
myself
and
amid
uproarious
laughter
we
made
confession
and
booby
was
relieved
from
his
disgrace
and
called
back
into
the
camp
and
patted
on
the
head
as
a
good
dog
and
he
has
now
more
friends
in
camp
than
ever
before
hauser
who
brought
down
the
birds
with
two
well
directed
shots
with
his
revolver
made
from
the
back
of
his
horse
without
halting
the
animal
had
expected
to
have
a
dainty
breakfast
but
he
is
himself
too
fond
of
a
practical
joke
to
express
any
disappointment
and
no
one
in
the
party
is
more
unconcerned
at
the
outcome
than
he
he
is
a
philosopher
and
as
i
know
from
eight
years
association
with
him
does
not
worry
over
the
evils
which
he
can
remedy
nor
those
which
he
can
not
remedy
there
can
be
found
no
better
man
than
he
for
such
a
trip
as
we
are
making
booby
is
taking
more
kindly
day
by
day
to
the
buckskin
moccasins
which
newt
made
and
tied
on
his
feet
a
few
days
ago
when
he
was
first
shod
with
them
he
rebelled
and
tore
them
off
with
his
teeth
but
i
think
he
has
discovered
that
they
lessen
his
sufferings
which
shows
that
he
has
some
good
dog
sense
left
and
that
probably
his
name
booby
is
a
misnomer
i
think
there
is
a
great
deal
of
good
in
the
animal
he
is
ever
on
the
alert
for
unusual
noises
or
sounds
and
the
assurance
which
i
have
that
he
will
give
the
alarm
in
case
any
thieving
indians
shall
approach
our
camp
in
the
night
is
a
great
relief
to
my
anxiety
lest
some
straggling
band
of
the
crows
may
set
us
afoot
jake
smith
was
on
guard
three
nights
ago
and
he
was
so
indifferent
to
the
question
of
safety
from
attack
that
he
enjoyed
a
comfortable
nap
while
doing
guard
duty
and
i
have
asked
our
artist
private
moore
to
make
for
me
a
sketch
of
smith
as
i
found
him
sound
asleep
with
his
saddle
for
a
pillow
jake
might
well
adopt
as
a
motto
suitable
for
his
guidance
while
doing
guard
duty
requieseat
in
pace
doubtless
jake
thought
shall
i
not
take
mine
ease
in
mine
inn
i
say
for
i
doubt
if
jake
can
give
a
correct
verbal
rendering
of
the
sentence
a
few
evenings
ago
he
jocosely
thought
to
establish
by
a
quotation
from
shakespeare
the
unreliability
of
a
member
of
our
party
who
was
telling
what
seemed
a
fish
story
and
he
clinched
his
argument
by
adding
that
he
would
apply
to
the
case
the
words
of
the
immortal
shakespeare
othello
gone
illustration
jake
smith
guarding
the
camp
from
hostile
indian
attack
requiescat
in
pace
we
broke
camp
this
morning
with
the
pack
train
at
traveling
in
a
westerly
course
for
about
two
miles
when
we
gradually
veered
around
to
a
nearly
easterly
direction
through
fallen
timber
almost
impassable
in
the
estimation
of
pilgrims
and
indeed
pretty
severe
on
our
pack
horses
for
there
was
no
trail
and
while
our
saddle
horses
with
their
riders
could
manage
to
force
their
way
through
between
the
trees
the
packs
on
the
pack
animals
would
frequently
strike
the
trees
holding
the
animals
fast
or
compelling
them
to
seek
some
other
passage
frequently
we
were
obliged
to
the
packs
and
narrow
them
so
as
to
admit
of
their
passage
between
the
standing
trees
at
one
point
the
pack
animals
became
separated
and
with
the
riding
animals
of
a
portion
of
the
party
were
confronted
with
a
prostrate
trunk
of
a
huge
tree
about
four
feet
in
diameter
around
which
it
was
impossible
to
pass
because
of
the
obstructions
of
fallen
timber
yet
pass
it
we
must
and
the
animals
one
after
another
were
brought
up
to
the
log
their
breasts
touching
it
when
williamson
and
i
the
two
strongest
men
of
the
party
on
either
side
of
an
animal
stooped
down
and
placing
each
a
shoulder
back
of
a
fore
leg
of
a
horse
rose
to
an
erect
position
while
others
of
the
party
placed
his
fore
feet
over
the
log
which
he
was
thus
enabled
to
scale
in
this
way
we
lifted
fifteen
or
twenty
of
our
animals
over
the
log
soon
after
leaving
our
camp
this
morning
our
little
invulnerable
while
climbing
a
steep
rocky
ascent
missed
his
footing
and
turned
three
back
summersaults
down
into
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
we
assisted
him
to
his
feet
without
removing
his
pack
and
he
seemed
none
the
worse
for
his
adventure
and
quickly
regained
the
ridge
from
which
he
had
fallen
and
joined
the
rest
of
the
herd
at
in
the
afternoon
we
halted
for
the
day
having
traveled
about
six
miles
but
our
camp
is
not
more
than
three
miles
from
our
morning
camp
hedges
pack
horse
little
invulnerable
was
missing
when
we
camped
and
as
i
was
one
of
the
four
men
detailed
for
the
day
to
take
charge
of
the
pack
train
i
returned
two
miles
on
our
trail
with
the
two
packers
reynolds
and
bean
in
search
of
him
we
found
him
wedged
between
two
trees
evidently
enjoying
a
rest
which
he
sorely
needed
after
his
remarkable
acrobatic
feat
of
the
morning
we
are
camped
in
a
basin
not
far
from
the
lake
which
surrounds
us
on
three
sides
east
north
and
west
everts
has
not
yet
come
into
camp
and
we
fear
that
he
is
lost
about
noon
we
crossed
a
small
stream
that
flows
towards
the
southwest
arm
of
the
lake
but
which
i
think
is
one
of
the
headwater
streams
of
snake
river
i
think
that
we
have
crossed
the
main
divide
of
the
rocky
mountains
twice
we
have
certainly
crossed
it
once
and
if
we
have
not
crossed
it
twice
we
are
now
camped
on
the
western
slope
of
the
main
divide
if
the
creek
we
crossed
about
noon
continues
to
flow
in
the
direction
it
was
running
at
the
point
where
we
crossed
it
it
must
discharge
into
the
southwest
arm
of
the
lake
and
it
seems
probable
that
everts
has
followed
down
this
stream
i
have
just
had
a
little
talk
with
lieutenant
doane
he
thinks
that
our
camp
is
on
the
snake
river
side
of
the
main
divide
and
there
are
many
things
that
incline
me
to
believe
that
he
is
correct
in
his
opinion
r
last
night
we
had
a
discussion
growing
out
of
the
fact
that
hedges
and
stickney
for
a
brief
time
were
lost
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
what
course
we
would
adopt
in
case
any
other
member
of
the
party
were
lost
and
we
agreed
that
in
such
case
we
would
all
move
on
as
rapidly
as
possible
to
the
southwest
arm
of
the
lake
where
there
are
hot
springs
the
vapor
of
which
we
noticed
from
our
camp
of
september
and
there
remain
until
all
the
party
were
united
everts
thought
a
better
way
for
a
lost
man
would
be
to
strike
out
nearly
due
west
hoping
to
reach
the
headwaters
of
the
madison
river
and
follow
that
stream
as
his
guide
to
the
settlements
but
he
finally
abandoned
this
idea
and
adopted
that
which
has
been
approved
by
the
rest
of
the
party
so
if
everts
does
not
come
into
camp
we
will
start
for
the
appointed
rendezvous
saturday
september
we
broke
camp
about
this
morning
taking
a
course
of
about
ten
degrees
north
of
west
traveling
seven
miles
and
coming
to
camp
on
the
lake
shore
at
about
five
miles
in
a
direct
line
from
our
morning
camp
at
half
past
two
no
sign
of
everts
has
been
seen
and
on
our
arrival
in
camp
gillette
and
trumbull
took
the
return
track
upon
the
shore
of
the
lake
hoping
to
find
him
or
discover
some
sign
of
him
a
large
fire
was
built
on
a
high
ridge
commanding
all
points
on
the
beach
and
we
fired
signal
guns
from
time
to
time
throughout
the
night
hauser
and
i
ascended
a
high
point
overlooking
our
camp
and
about
eight
hundred
feet
above
it
where
from
the
top
of
a
tall
tree
i
had
a
fairly
good
view
of
the
shore
outline
of
the
west
and
south
shores
of
the
lake
with
all
the
inlets
points
and
islands
we
were
also
enabled
to
mark
out
our
course
of
travel
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
follow
in
order
to
reach
the
most
southwesterly
arm
of
the
lake
and
take
advantage
of
openings
in
the
timber
to
facilitate
travel
on
this
high
point
we
built
a
large
fire
which
could
be
seen
for
many
miles
in
all
directions
by
any
one
not
under
the
bank
of
the
lake
and
which
we
hoped
everts
might
see
and
so
be
directed
to
our
camp
in
going
to
the
summit
we
traveled
several
hundred
feet
on
a
rocky
ridge
not
wide
enough
for
safe
travel
by
a
man
on
horseback
at
an
elevation
of
about
eight
hundred
feet
above
yellowstone
lake
we
found
two
small
lakes
nestled
in
a
deep
recess
in
the
mountain
and
surrounded
by
the
overturned
rocks
our
route
has
been
entirely
through
fallen
timber
and
it
has
been
a
hard
day
of
travel
on
our
horses
necessitating
jumping
over
logs
and
dead
branches
of
trees
and
thus
we
have
made
very
slow
progress
the
map
of
yellowstone
lake
which
we
will
be
enabled
to
complete
from
the
observations
made
will
show
that
its
shape
is
very
different
from
that
shown
on
captain
raynolds
map
the
lake
has
but
three
islands
we
are
more
than
ever
anxious
about
everts
we
had
hoped
this
morning
to
make
our
camp
on
the
southwest
arm
of
the
lake
but
the
fallen
timber
has
delayed
us
in
our
travel
and
prevented
our
doing
so
the
southwest
arm
of
the
lake
has
been
our
objective
point
for
the
past
three
days
and
we
feel
assured
that
everts
finding
himself
lost
will
press
on
for
that
point
and
as
he
will
not
be
hindered
by
the
care
of
a
pack
train
he
can
travel
twice
as
far
in
one
day
as
we
can
and
we
are
therefore
the
more
anxious
to
reach
our
destination
we
have
carefully
considered
all
the
points
in
the
case
and
have
unanimously
decided
that
it
will
be
utter
folly
to
remain
in
camp
here
and
equally
so
to
have
remained
in
this
morning
camp
hoping
that
he
would
overtake
us
on
the
evening
that
hedges
was
lost
everts
told
him
that
he
ought
to
have
struck
out
for
the
lake
as
he
everts
would
do
if
lost
so
we
will
move
on

gillette
and
trumbull
returned
to
camp
this
morning
having
traversed
the
shore
of
the
lake
to
a
point
east
of
our
camp
of
september
without
discovering
any
sign
of
everts
we
have
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
he
has
either
struck
out
for
the
lake
on
the
west
or
followed
down
the
stream
which
we
crossed
the
day
he
was
lost
or
that
he
is
possibly
following
us
the
latter
however
is
not
very
probable
hauser
lieutenant
doane
and
i
saddled
up
immediately
after
breakfast
and
with
a
supply
of
provisions
for
everts
pressed
forward
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
the
party
marking
a
trail
for
the
pack
animals
through
the
openings
in
the
dense
woods
and
avoiding
as
far
as
possible
the
fallen
timber
we
rode
through
with
all
possible
dispatch
watching
carefully
for
the
tracks
of
a
horse
but
found
no
sign
of
everts
we
followed
both
the
beach
and
the
trail
on
the
bank
for
several
miles
in
either
direction
but
we
saw
neither
sign
nor
track
the
small
stream
which
we
crossed
on
the
does
not
flow
into
this
arm
of
the
lake
as
we
thought
it
might
and
it
is
evidently
a
tributary
of
the
snake
river
the
pack
train
arrived
early
in
the
afternoon
with
the
rest
of
the
party
and
all
were
astonished
and
saddened
that
no
trace
of
everts
had
been
found
we
shall
mature
a
plan
for
a
systematic
search
for
him
it
is
probable
that
we
will
make
this
camp
the
base
of
operations
and
remain
here
several
days
everts
has
with
him
a
supply
of
matches
ammunition
and
fishing
tackle
and
if
he
will
but
travel
in
a
direct
line
and
not
veer
around
to
the
right
or
left
in
a
circle
he
will
yet
be
all
right
directly
west
of
our
camp
on
the
further
side
of
this
arm
of
the
lake
and
about
four
miles
distant
are
several
hot
springs
which
we
shall
visit
before
leaving
the
lake
we
were
roused
this
morning
about
by
the
shrill
howl
of
a
mountain
lion
and
again
while
we
were
at
breakfast
we
heard
another
yell
as
we
stood
around
our
campfire
our
ears
were
saluted
with
a
shriek
so
terribly
human
that
for
a
moment
we
believed
it
to
be
a
call
from
everts
and
we
hallooed
in
response
and
several
of
our
party
started
in
the
direction
whence
the
sounds
came
and
would
have
instituted
a
search
for
our
comrade
but
for
an
admonitory
growl
of
a
mountain
lion
we
have
traveled
about
seven
miles
on
leaving
our
camps
yesterday
and
we
posted
conspicuously
at
each
a
placard
stating
clearly
the
direction
we
had
taken
and
where
provisions
could
be
found
the
country
through
which
we
have
passed
for
the
past
five
days
is
like
that
facetiously
described
by
bridger
as
being
so
desolate
and
impassable
and
barren
of
resources
that
even
the
crows
flying
over
it
were
obliged
to
carry
along
with
them
supplies
of
provisions
monday
september
in
accordance
with
our
programme
three
parties
were
sent
out
this
morning
in
search
of
everts
smith
and
trumbull
were
to
follow
the
take
shore
until
they
came
in
sight
of
our
last
camp
hauser
and
gillette
were
to
return
on
our
trail
through
the
woods
taking
with
them
their
blankets
and
two
days
rations
general
washburn
and
myself
were
to
take
a
southerly
direction
towards
what
we
called
brown
mountain
some
twelve
miles
away
smith
and
trumbull
returned
early
in
the
afternoon
and
reported
having
seen
in
the
sand
the
tracks
of
a
man
foot
and
smith
thought
that
he
saw
several
indians
who
disappeared
in
the
woods
as
they
approached
but
trumbull
who
was
with
him
did
not
see
them
and
smith
says
it
was
because
he
was
for
some
reason
they
did
not
pursue
their
investigations
farther
and
soon
returned
in
good
order
to
camp
the
reconnaissance
made
by
general
washburn
and
myself
resulted
in
no
discovery
of
any
trace
of
everts
we
traveled
about
eleven
miles
directly
south
nearly
to
the
base
of
brown
mountain
carefully
examining
the
ground
the
whole
of
the
way
to
see
if
any
horseshoe
tracks
could
be
discovered
we
crossed
no
stream
between
the
lake
and
the
mountain
and
if
everts
followed
the
stream
which
we
crossed
on
the
he
is
south
of
brown
mountain
for
it
is
evident
that
he
did
not
pass
westward
between
brown
mountain
and
yellowstone
lake
otherwise
we
would
have
discovered
the
tracks
of
his
horse
it
is
now
night
and
hauser
and
gillette
have
not
yet
returned
two
miles
on
this
side
the
north
side
of
brown
mountain
washburn
and
i
passed
over
a
low
divide
which
i
think
must
be
the
main
range
of
the
rocky
mountains
just
beyond
which
is
another
brimstone
basin
containing
forty
or
fifty
boiling
sulphur
and
mud
springs
and
any
number
of
small
steam
jets
a
small
creek
runs
through
the
basin
and
the
slopes
of
the
mountains
on
either
side
to
the
height
of
several
hundred
feet
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
volcanic
action
beneath
the
crust
over
which
we
were
traveling
a
considerable
portion
of
the
slope
of
the
mountain
was
covered
with
a
hollow
incrustation
of
sulphur
and
lime
or
silica
from
which
issued
in
many
places
hot
steam
and
we
found
many
small
craters
from
six
to
twelve
inches
in
diameter
from
which
issued
the
sound
of
the
boiling
sulphur
or
mud
and
in
many
instances
we
could
see
the
mud
or
sulphur
water
there
are
many
other
springs
of
water
slightly
impregnated
with
sulphur
in
which
the
water
was
too
hot
for
us
to
bear
the
hand
more
than
two
or
three
seconds
and
which
overflowed
the
green
spaces
between
the
incrustations
completely
saturating
the
ground
and
over
which
in
many
places
the
grass
had
grown
forming
a
turf
compact
and
solid
enough
to
bear
the
weight
of
a
man
ordinarily
but
when
it
once
gave
way
the
underlying
deposit
was
so
thin
that
it
afforded
no
support
while
crossing
heedless
of
general
washburn
warning
one
of
these
green
places
my
horse
broke
through
and
sank
to
his
body
as
if
in
a
bed
of
quicksand
i
was
off
his
back
in
an
instant
and
succeeded
in
extricating
the
struggling
animal
the
turf
being
strong
enough
to
bear
his
body
alone
without
the
addition
of
the
weight
of
a
man
the
fore
legs
of
my
horse
however
had
gone
through
the
turf
into
the
hot
thin
mud
beneath
general
washburn
who
was
a
few
yards
behind
me
on
an
incrusted
mound
of
lime
and
sulphur
which
bore
us
in
all
cases
and
who
had
just
before
called
to
me
to
keep
off
the
grassy
place
as
there
was
danger
beneath
it
inquired
of
me
if
the
deposit
beneath
the
turf
was
hot
without
making
examination
i
answered
that
i
thought
it
might
be
warm
shortly
afterwards
the
turf
again
gave
way
and
my
horse
plunged
more
violently
than
before
throwing
me
over
his
head
and
as
i
fell
my
right
arm
was
thrust
violently
through
the
treacherous
surface
into
the
scalding
morass
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
rescued
my
poor
horse
and
i
found
it
necessary
to
instantly
remove
my
glove
to
avoid
blistering
my
hand
the
frenzied
floundering
of
my
horse
had
in
the
first
instance
suggested
to
general
washburn
the
idea
that
the
under
stratum
was
hot
enough
to
scald
him
general
washburn
was
right
in
his
conjecture
it
is
a
fortunate
circumstance
that
i
rode
my
pack
horse
for
if
i
had
ridden
my
heavy
saddle
horse
i
think
that
the
additional
weight
of
his
body
would
have
broken
the
turf
which
held
up
the
lighter
animal
and
that
he
would
have
disappeared
in
the
hot
boiling
mud
taking
me
with
him
at
the
base
of
brown
mountain
is
a
lake
the
size
of
which
we
could
not
very
accurately
ascertain
but
which
was
probably
about
two
miles
long
by
of
a
mile
wide
on
the
south
end
appeared
to
be
an
outlet
and
it
seems
to
be
near
the
head
of
the
snake
river
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
reaching
the
beach
growing
out
of
the
mishaps
arising
from
the
giving
way
of
the
turf
as
i
have
described
our
nearest
approach
to
the
lake
was
about
of
a
mile
during
the
absence
of
washburn
and
myself
hedges
has
spent
the
day
in
fishing
catching
forty
of
the
fine
trout
with
which
the
lake
abounds
stickney
has
made
an
inventory
of
our
larder
and
we
find
that
our
luxuries
such
as
coffee
sugar
and
flour
are
nearly
used
up
and
that
we
have
barely
enough
of
necessary
provisions
salt
pepper
to
last
us
ten
days
longer
with
economy
in
their
use
we
will
remain
at
the
lake
probably
three
or
four
days
longer
with
the
hope
of
finding
some
trace
of
everts
when
it
will
be
necessary
to
turn
our
faces
homewards
to
avoid
general
disaster
and
in
the
meantime
we
will
dry
a
few
hundred
pounds
of
trout
and
carry
them
with
us
as
a
precautionary
measure
against
starvation
at
all
of
our
camps
for
the
past
three
days
and
along
the
line
of
travel
between
them
we
have
blazed
the
trees
as
a
guide
for
everts
and
have
left
a
small
supply
of
provisions
at
each
place
securely
cached
with
notices
directing
everts
to
the
places
of
concealment
the
soldiers
rations
issued
for
thirty
days
service
will
barely
hold
out
for
their
own
use
and
we
have
little
chance
of
borrowing
from
them
we
left
helena
with
thirty
rations
expecting
to
be
absent
but
days
we
have
already
been
journeying
days
and
are
still
a
long
way
from
home
a
few
nights
ago
i
became
ravenously
hungry
while
on
guard
and
ate
a
small
loaf
of
bread
one
of
five
loaves
that
i
found
in
a
pan
by
the
campfire
i
was
not
aware
at
the
time
that
these
loaves
were
a
part
of
the
soldiers
breakfast
rations
nor
did
i
know
that
in
the
army
service
each
soldier
has
his
own
particular
ration
of
bread
so
the
next
morning
with
one
ration
of
bread
missing
one
soldier
would
have
been
short
in
his
allowance
if
the
others
had
not
shared
their
loaves
with
him
i
supposed
at
the
time
of
my
discovery
of
the
five
loaves
that
they
belonged
to
the
larder
of
the
washburn
branch
of
the
party
not
to
the
escort
and
i
apologized
to
the
soldiers
when
i
learned
the
truth
and
we
are
now
as
good
friends
as
ever
but
from
an
occasional
remark
which
they
drop
in
my
presence
i
perceive
that
they
think
they
have
the
laugh
on
me
unfortunately
for
them
we
will
part
company
before
we
reach
the
settlements
and
i
will
have
no
opportunity
to
my
obligations
hard
work
and
plain
living
have
already
reduced
my
superfluous
flesh
and
my
clothes
like
a
lady
loose
gown
hang
about
me
as
the
old
song
runs
day
before
yesterday
gillette
and
i
discussed
the
question
of
the
probability
of
a
man
being
able
to
sustain
life
in
this
region
by
depending
for
his
subsistence
upon
whatever
roots
or
berries
are
to
be
found
here
we
have
once
before
referred
to
the
fact
that
we
have
seen
none
of
the
roots
which
are
to
be
found
in
other
parts
of
the
rocky
mountain
region
and
especially
in
the
elevated
valleys
we
have
not
noticed
on
this
trip
a
single
growing
plant
or
specimen
of
the
camas
the
cowse
or
yamph
if
everts
has
followed
the
stream
on
which
we
were
camped
the
day
he
was
lost
down
into
the
snake
river
valley
he
will
find
an
abundance
of
the
camas
root
which
is
most
nutritions
and
which
will
sustain
his
life
if
he
has
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
root
to
distinguish
the
edible
from
the
poisonous
plant
i
have
been
told
by
james
stuart
that
in
the
valley
of
the
snake
river
the
camas
and
the
cowse
roots
are
to
be
found
in
great
abundance
and
are
much
prized
as
food
by
the
indians
cowse
is
a
nez
perce
word
the
snake
indians
give
the
name
thoig
to
the
same
root
it
grows
in
great
abundance
in
the
country
of
the
nez
perce
indians
who
eat
great
quantities
of
it
and
these
indians
are
called
by
the
snake
indians
the
thoig
or
the
camas
is
both
flour
and
potatoes
for
several
wandering
nations
and
it
is
found
in
the
most
barren
and
desolate
regions
in
greatest
quantity
the
camas
is
a
small
round
root
not
unlike
an
onion
in
appearance
it
is
sweet
to
the
taste
full
of
gluten
and
very
satisfying
to
a
hungry
man
the
indians
have
a
mode
of
preparing
it
which
makes
it
very
relishable
in
a
hole
a
foot
in
depth
and
six
feet
in
diameter
from
which
the
turf
has
been
carefully
removed
they
build
a
fire
for
the
purpose
of
heating
the
exposed
earth
surface
while
in
another
fire
they
heat
at
the
same
time
a
sufficient
number
of
flat
rocks
to
serve
as
a
cover
after
the
heating
process
is
completed
the
roots
are
spread
over
the
bottom
of
the
hole
covered
with
the
turf
with
the
grass
side
down
the
heated
rocks
spread
above
and
a
fire
built
upon
them
and
the
process
of
cooking
produces
about
the
same
change
in
the
camas
that
is
produced
in
coffee
by
roasting
it
also
preserves
it
in
a
suitable
form
for
ready
use
the
yamph
has
a
longer
and
smaller
bulb
than
the
camas
though
not
quite
as
nutritious
and
may
be
eaten
raw
either
of
these
roots
contains
nutriment
sufficient
to
support
life
and
often
in
the
experience
of
the
tribes
of
the
mountains
winters
have
been
passed
with
no
other
food
there
is
a
poisonous
camas
which
is
sometimes
mistaken
for
the
genuine
root
but
which
can
not
be
eaten
in
large
quantities
without
fatal
results
it
always
grows
where
the
true
camas
is
found
and
much
care
is
necessary
to
avoid
mixing
the
two
while
gathering
the
roots
in
any
considerable
quantity
so
great
is
the
esteem
in
which
the
camas
is
held
that
many
of
the
important
localities
of
the
country
in
which
it
is
found
are
named
for
it
s

of
spring
showing
how
branches
and
twigs
lodge
at
the
point
of

so
as
to
make
a
foundation
for
grass
and
earth
until
the
spring
is
filled
to
the
top
and
the
surface
is
covered
with
a
living
turf
strong
enough
to
bear
a
considerable
weight
lieutenant
doane
was
much
amazed
at
the
appearance
of
my
horse
legs
upon
our
return
from
brown
mountain
and
has
asked
general
washburn
and
myself
what
can
be
the
nature
of
the
ground
where
such
a
mishap
could
occur
my
theory
of
the
matter
is
this
we
frequently
found
springs
of
hot
water
though
not
boiling
some
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
in
diameter
at
the
top
the
sides
of
which
were
and
converged
to
a
narrow
opening
of
say
three
feet
diameter
at
a
depth
of
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
and
which
below
the
point
of
convergence
opened
out
like
an
hour
glass
in
some
of
these
springs
at
the
point
of
convergence
we
found
tree
branches
that
had
fallen
into
the
spring
and
had
become
impregnated
with
the
silica
or
lime
of
the
water
we
call
it
i
saw
a
number
of
such
springs
in
which
several
branches
of
trees
were
lying
across
the
small
opening
at
the
point
of
convergence
when
once
these
are
firmly
lodged
they
form
a
support
for
smaller
branches
and
twigs
and
thus
the
tufts
of
grass
which
the
spring
floods
or
melting
snows
bring
down
from
the
sides
of
the
mountain
will
after
a
few
years
made
a
sufficiently
strong
foundation
for
the
earth
which
will
also
wash
down
the
slopes
into
the
spring
once
a
firm
footing
is
established
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
when
the
spring
will
be
filled
to
the
brim
with
earth
then
gradually
the
seed
blown
over
the
surface
of
the
spring
from
the
weeds
and
grass
near
by
will
take
root
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
a
strong
turf
will
be
formed
through
which
the
water
may
percolate
in
many
places
though
giving
to
the
unsuspecting
traveler
no
sign
of
its
treacherous
character
i
think
that
it
was
through
such
a
turf
as
this
that
the
fore
legs
of
my
horse
and
my
right
hand
were
plunged
t
illustration
breaking
through
the
turf
formed
over
the
surface
of
such
a
spring
as
that
shown
above
my
pack
horse
which
i
rode
a
buckskin
colored
broncho
which
is
docile
under
the
pack
saddle
bucked
as
i
mounted
him
this
morning
but
i
kept
my
seat
in
the
saddle
without
difficulty
walter
trumbull
however
on
my
return
presented
me
with
a
sketch
which
he
says
is
a
faithful
portrayal
of
both
horse
and
rider
in
the
acrobatic
act
i
think
the
sketch
is
an
exaggeration
and
that
i
hugged
the
saddle
in
better
form
than
it
indicates

tuesday
september
it
was
jake
smith
turn
to
stand
guard
last
night
but
he
refused
to
do
so
and
washburn
took
his
place
we
have
remained
in
camp
all
day
at
about
this
morning
it
began
to
rain
and
hail
and
we
have
had
a
little
snow
which
continued
to
fall
at
intervals
all
day
at
about
this
evening
hauser
and
gillette
arrived
in
camp
having
returned
on
the
trail
to
within
three
miles
of
the
place
where
we
camped
on
the
night
of
september
they
examined
the
trail
and
the
beach
with
the
utmost
care
but
without
discovering
any
trace
of
everts
they
say
that
the
trail
over
which
our
train
passed
or
rather
the
path
which
our
train
made
was
hardly
plain
enough
to
be
followed
and
in
many
places
where
the
pine
leaves
had
fallen
thick
upon
the
ground
it
was
totally
invisible
so
that
no
one
could
have
followed
it
with
certainty
except
by
dismounting
and
closely
observing
the
ground
at
every
step
they
made
the
journey
very
well
from
the
fact
that
they
had
traveled
the
route
once
before
and
their
horses
instinctively
followed
the
back
path
for
a
great
part
of
the
distance
without
any
special
guidance
on
their
near
approach
to
camp
when
the
trail
was
no
longer
discernible
their
dog
booby
took
the
lead
when
they
were
at
fault
and
brought
them
into
camp
all
right
they
think
they
might
have
been
forced
to
lie
out
all
night
but
for
the
sagacity
of
booby
they
made
on
each
of
the
two
days
nearly
as
great
a
distance
as
our
train
traveled
in
four
days
their
report
has
fully
set
at
rest
the
question
of
everts
having
followed
us
it
settles
as
a
fact
that
he
did
not
again
strike
our
trail
and
that
had
he
done
so
he
could
not
have
followed
it
owing
to
his
hauser
and
gillette
are
probably
the
two
best
trailers
and
woodsmen
in
our
party
and
their
report
of
the
condition
of
the
trail
and
the
difficulty
experienced
in
following
it
has
satisfied
us
that
everts
has
either
struck
off
in
a
southerly
direction
following
perhaps
the
headwaters
of
the
snake
river
or
that
he
has
made
an
effort
to
reach
the
head
of
the
lake
with
a
view
of
returning
by
our
trail
to
boteler
ranch
it
is
snowing
hard
and
the
prospect
for
a
day
or
two
more
in
this
camp
is
very
good
the
murky
atmosphere
brings
to
view
a
number
of
springs
on
the
opposite
shore
of
this
arm
of
the
lake
and
farther
back
in
the
hills
which
we
have
not
heretofore
seen
and
the
steam
is
rising
from
fifty
craters
in
the
timbered
ridge
giving
it
the
appearance
of
a
new
england
factory
village
after
holding
a
council
this
evening
we
have
resolved
to
remain
at
this
place
two
days
more
hoping
that
everts
may
overtake
us
this
arm
of
the
lake
being
the
of
our
travel
fixed
on
the
day
before
that
on
which
everts
was
lost
wednesday
september
we
have
remained
in
camp
all
day
as
it
is
next
to
impossible
to
move
the
snow
is
nearly
two
feet
deep
and
is
very
wet
and
heavy
and
our
horses
are
pawing
in
it
for
forage
our
large
army
tent
is
doing
us
good
service
and
as
there
is
an
abundance
of
dry
wood
close
by
our
camp
we
are
extremely
comfortable
i
am
the
only
one
of
the
party
who
has
a
pair
of
boots
and
i
was
up
and
out
of
the
tent
this
morning
before
daylight
cutting
into
cordwood
a
pine
log
and
before
noon
i
had
more
than
a
half
cord
at
the
tent
door
washburn
and
hauser
offered
to
do
some
of
this
work
if
i
would
loan
them
my
boots
but
as
they
are
of
a
full
size
for
me
and
would
probably
drop
off
of
their
feet
i
told
them
that
i
would
get
the
wood
lieutenant
doane
requested
me
to
loan
him
this
diary
from
which
to
write
up
his
records
as
the
condition
of
his
thumb
has
interfered
with
his
use
of
a
pen
or
pencil
i
have
accordingly
loaned
it
to
him
and
private
moore
has
been
busy
the
greater
part
of
the
day
copying
portions
of
it
for
myself
i
am
very
glad
to
have
a
day
of
rest
for
i
have
felt
much
wearied
for
several
days
i
think
that
i
am
certainly
within
bounds
when
i
say
that
i
have
put
in
sixteen
hours
a
day
of
pretty
hard
work
attending
to
camp
duties
and
writing
each
day
till
late
at
night
and
i
realize
that
this
journal
of
travel
is
becoming
ponderous
yet
there
is
daily
crowded
upon
my
vision
so
much
of
novelty
and
wonder
which
should
be
brought
to
the
notice
of
the
world
and
which
so
far
as
my
individual
effort
is
concerned
will
be
lost
to
it
if
i
do
not
record
the
incidents
of
each
day
travel
that
i
am
determined
to
make
my
journal
as
full
as
possible
and
to
purposely
omit
no
details
it
is
a
lifetime
opportunity
for
publishing
to
all
who
may
be
interested
a
complete
record
of
the
discoveries
of
an
expedition
which
in
coming
time
will
rank
among
the
first
and
most
important
of
american
explorations
it
is
cold
and
the
water
in
a
pail
standing
at
our
tent
door
was
frozen
at
in
the
evening
the
water
fowl
are
more
abundant
at
this
point
than
they
have
been
elsewhere
on
the
lake
on
our
journey
around
it
and
we
could
see
hundreds
of
swans
geese
and
ducks
and
many
pelicans
and
gulls
thursday
september
this
forenoon
the
weather
moderated
and
the
snow
has
melted
so
that
it
is
but
about
ten
inches
deep
still
our
horses
are
becoming
restless
for
want
of
sufficient
food
the
patches
of
grass
which
may
be
found
under
the
snow
are
very
limited
in
extent
and
as
the
animals
are
confined
to
the
length
of
their
lariats
foraging
is
much
more
difficult
than
if
they
were
running
loose
we
have
seen
no
signs
of
indians
following
us
since
we
made
our
first
camp
upon
the
lake
and
but
little
evidence
that
they
have
ever
been
here
except
some
few
logs
piled
so
as
to
conceal
from
view
a
hunter
who
may
be
attempting
to
bring
down
some
of
the
game
swimming
on
the
lake
we
feel
convinced
that
jake
smith
drew
upon
both
his
imagination
and
his
fears
three
days
ago
when
he
reported
that
he
had
seen
indians
on
the
beach
of
the
lake
illustration
lieut
gustavus
c
doane
each
night
that
we
have
been
camped
here
we
have
heard
the
shrill
cries
of
the
mountain
lions
and
under
a
momentary
illusion
i
have
each
time
been
half
convinced
that
it
was
a
human
being
in
distress
because
of
the
mountain
lions
we
are
keeping
close
watch
upon
our
horses
they
are
very
fond
of
horse
flesh
and
oftentimes
will
follow
a
horseman
a
long
distance
more
to
make
a
meal
upon
the
flesh
of
the
horse
than
for
the
purpose
of
attacking
the
rider
illustration
jack
baronette
during
the
three
days
we
have
spent
in
this
camp
i
have
been
enabled
to
complete
my
diary
for
september
and
which
were
red
letter
days
days
of
great
anxiety
i
had
a
good
nap
this
afternoon
while
my
diary
was
being
used
for
lieutenant
doane
and
i
feel
greatly
refreshed
my
first
thought
on
awakening
was
for
poor
everts
i
wonder
where
he
can
be
throughout
all
this
fierce
storm
and
deep
snow
perhaps
the
snow
did
not
reach
him
for
i
noticed
that
the
ground
was
quite
bare
on
the
opposite
side
of
this
arm
of
the
lake
while
the
snow
is
eight
or
ten
inches
deep
here
at
our
camp
hauser
is
not
feeling
very
well
friday
september
we
this
morning
resolved
to
move
over
to
the
vicinity
of
the
hot
springs
on
the
opposite
side
of
this
arm
of
the
lake
from
which
point
we
will
leave
the
yellowstone
for
the
madison
river
or
some
one
of
its
branches
we
followed
up
the
beach
for
half
a
mile
and
then
journeyed
along
the
bank
of
the
lake
through
the
woods
for
a
mile
to
avoid
the
quicksands
on
the
lake
shore
then
taking
the
beach
again
we
followed
it
to
the
springs
where
we
are
now
camped
u
these
springs
surpass
in
extent
variety
and
beauty
any
which
we
have
heretofore
seen
they
extend
for
the
distance
of
nearly
a
mile
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
back
from
the
beach
about
one
hundred
yards
they
number
between
ninety
and
one
hundred
springs
of
all
imaginable
varieties
farthest
from
the
beach
are
the
springs
of
boiling
mud
in
some
of
which
the
mud
is
very
thin
in
others
of
such
a
consistency
that
it
is
heaped
up
as
it
boils
over
gradually
spreading
under
its
own
weight
until
it
covers
quite
a
large
surface
the
mud
or
clay
is
of
different
colors
that
in
some
of
the
springs
is
nearly
as
white
as
white
marble
in
others
it
is
of
a
lavender
color
in
others
it
is
of
a
rich
pink
of
different
shades
i
have
taken
specimens
of
each
which
i
will
have
analyzed
on
my
return
home
v
in
close
proximity
to
these
are
springs
discharging
water
nearly
clear
and
apparently
odorless
the
bottoms
and
sides
of
which
as
well
as
of
the
channels
of
the
streams
running
from
them
are
covered
with
soft
deposits
of
some
substance
they
contain
in
solution
these
deposits
and
the
hard
incrustations
around
the
edges
of
the
springs
are
of
various
colors
in
some
cases
being
dark
red
in
others
scarlet
in
others
yellow
and
in
still
others
green
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
are
several
boiling
springs
situated
in
the
top
of
incrusted
craters
but
which
do
not
boil
over
the
sediment
which
has
been
deposited
around
them
forming
a
wall
or
embankment
holding
back
the
water
but
the
most
remarkable
of
all
the
springs
at
this
point
are
six
or
seven
of
a
character
differing
from
any
of
the
rest
the
water
in
them
is
of
a
dark
blue
or
hue
but
it
is
wonderfully
clear
and
transparent
two
of
these
springs
are
quite
large
the
remaining
five
are
smaller
their
diameters
ranging
from
eight
to
fifteen
feet
the
water
in
one
of
these
latter
is
thrown
up
to
the
height
of
two
feet
the
largest
two
of
these
springs
are
irregular
in
their
general
outline
of
nearly
an
oval
shape
the
larger
of
the
two
being
about
feet
wide
by
forty
long
and
the
smaller
about
twenty
by
thirty
feet
the
discharge
from
each
of
them
is
about
one
gallon
per
minute
the
sides
of
the
springs
are
and
converge
until
at
the
depth
of
thirty
feet
the
opening
is
about
eight
feet
in
diameter
from
the
surface
or
rim
down
to
the
lowest
point
of
convergence
where
the
opening
enlarges
the
sides
of
the
funnel
which
are
corrugated
and
very
uneven
and
irregular
are
covered
with
a
white
deposit
or
incrustation
which
contrasts
vividly
with
the
dark
opening
at
its
base
which
is
distinctly
visible
at
the
depth
of
forty
feet
these
two
springs
are
distant
from
each
other
about
twenty
yards
and
there
is
a
difference
of
about
four
feet
in
the
elevation
or
level
of
the
water
one
peculiar
feature
of
all
these
springs
is
that
they
seem
to
have
no
connection
with
each
other
beneath
the
surface
we
find
springs
situated
five
or
six
feet
apart
of
the
same
general
appearance
but
of
different
temperatures
and
with
the
water
upon
different
levels
the
overflow
from
these
springs
for
a
great
number
of
years
has
formed
an
incrusted
bank
overlooking
the
border
of
the
lake
rising
to
the
height
of
six
feet
and
as
the
streams
running
from
the
springs
are
bordered
with
incrustations
of
various
hues
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
deposit
or
substance
in
solution
so
the
incrusted
bank
which
has
been
in
process
of
formation
for
ages
exhibits
all
of
these
varied
colors
in
a
number
of
places
along
the
bank
of
the
lake
this
incrusted
deposit
is
broken
down
and
has
crumbled
into
small
pieces
upon
which
the
waves
have
dashed
until
they
have
been
moulded
into
many
curious
shapes
and
having
all
the
colors
of
the
deposits
in
the
springs
white
red
and
white
blended
yellow
and
green
cavernous
hollows
which
fill
the
shore
incrustation
respond
in
weird
and
melancholy
echoes
to
the
dash
of
the
billows
the
bottoms
of
the
streams
flowing
from
the
deeper
springs
have
for
some
distance
a
pure
white
incrustation
farther
down
the
slope
the
deposit
is
white
in
the
center
with
sides
of
red
and
still
farther
down
the
white
deposit
is
hidden
entirely
by
the
red
combined
with
yellow
from
nearly
all
these
springs
we
obtained
specimens
of
the
adjoining
incrustations
all
of
which
were
too
hot
to
be
held
for
more
than
a
moment
even
with
the
gloved
hand
between
the
springs
all
along
the
border
of
the
lake
were
small
craters
from
which
issued
hot
steam
or
vapor
besides
which
there
were
many
cold
craters
along
the
edge
of
the
lake
out
in
the
water
from
ten
to
thirty
feet
from
the
shore
are
to
be
found
springs
with
the
water
bubbling
up
a
few
inches
above
the
surface
none
of
the
springs
in
this
locality
appeared
to
be
very
strongly
impregnated
with
sulphur
some
of
the
incrustations
on
the
beach
are
as
white
and
delicate
as
alabaster
these
are
the
springs
which
we
observed
on
september
from
our
camp
on
the
eastern
shore
of
the
lake
our
explorations
of
the
yellowstone
will
cease
at
this
point
and
we
start
in
our
search
for
firehole
basin
our
journey
around
yellowstone
lake
in
close
proximity
to
the
beach
is
doubtless
the
first
ever
attempted
and
although
it
has
been
attended
with
difficulty
and
distress
these
have
been
to
me
as
nothing
compared
with
the
enjoyment
the
journey
has
afforded
and
it
is
with
the
greatest
regret
that
i
turn
my
face
from
it
homewards
how
can
i
sum
up
its
wonderful
attractions
it
is
dotted
with
islands
of
great
beauty
as
yet
unvisited
by
man
but
which
at
no
remote
period
will
be
adorned
with
villas
and
the
ornaments
of
civilized
life
the
winds
from
the
mountain
gorges
roll
its
placid
waters
into
a
furious
sea
and
crest
its
billows
with
foam
forests
of
pine
deep
dark
and
almost
impenetrable
are
scattered
at
random
along
its
banks
and
its
beautiful
margin
presents
every
variety
of
sand
and
pebbly
beach
glittering
with
crystals
carnelians
and
chalcedony
the
indians
approach
it
under
the
fear
of
a
superstition
originating
in
the
volcanic
forces
surrounding
it
which
amounts
almost
to
entire
exclusion
it
possesses
adaptabilities
for
the
highest
display
of
artificial
culture
amid
the
greatest
wonders
of
nature
that
the
world
affords
and
is
beautified
by
the
grandeur
of
the
most
extensive
mountain
scenery
and
not
many
years
can
elapse
before
the
march
of
civil
improvement
will
reclaim
this
delightful
solitude
and
garnish
it
with
all
the
attractions
of
cultivated
taste
and
refinement
strange
and
interesting
as
are
the
various
objects
which
we
have
met
with
in
this
vast
field
of
natural
wonders
no
camp
or
place
of
rest
on
our
journey
has
afforded
our
party
greater
satisfaction
than
the
one
we
are
now
occupying
which
is
our
first
camp
since
emerging
from
the
dense
forest
filled
with
gloom
at
the
loss
of
our
comrade
tired
tattered
browned
by
exposure
and
reduced
in
flesh
by
our
labors
we
resemble
more
a
party
of
organized
mendicants
than
of
men
in
pursuit
of
greatest
novelties
but
from
this
point
we
hope
that
our
journey
will
be
comparatively
free
from
difficulties
of
travel
hauser
experience
as
a
civil
engineer
has
been
an
invaluable
aid
in
judging
of
the
lay
of
the
land
and
so
in
giving
direction
to
our
party
in
its
journeying
around
the
lake
in
speaking
of
this
hauser
says
that
he
thinks
that
i
have
a
more
correct
idea
of
mountain
heights
distances
and
directions
and
can
follow
a
direct
course
through
dense
timber
more
unerringly
than
any
man
he
knows
except
james
stuart
a
compliment
which
i
accept
most
graciously
some
of
our
party
declare
that
they
would
have
had
no
expectation
of
finding
their
way
back
to
camp
if
they
had
ventured
into
the
forest
in
search
of
everts
i
recited
to
washburn
and
hauser
an
extract
from
the
task
by
the
poet
cowper
which
in
my
younger
days
i
memorized
for
declamation
and
which
i
think
is
at
once
expressive
of
our
experience
in
the
journey
around
the
lake
and
of
our
present
relief
as
one
who
long
in
thickets
and
in
brakes
entangled
winds
now
this
way
and
now
that
his
devious
course
uncertain
seeking
home
or
having
long
in
miry
ways
been
foiled
and
sore
discomfited
from
slough
to
slough
plunging
and
half
despairing
of
escape
if
chance
at
length
he
finds
a
smooth
and
faithful
to
the
foot
his
spirits
rise
he
chirrups
brisk
his
steed
and
winds
his
way
with
pleasure
and
with
ease
it
is
a
source
of
great
regret
to
us
all
that
we
must
leave
this
place
and
abandon
the
search
for
everts
but
our
provisions
are
rapidly
diminishing
and
force
of
circumstances
obliges
us
to
move
forward
we
still
indulge
the
hope
that
he
may
have
found
and
followed
down
some
branch
of
the
madison
river
and
reached
virginia
city
or
down
snake
river
and
reached
some
settlement
in
that
valley
and
but
for
our
anxiety
to
reach
home
and
prove
or
disprove
our
expectations
we
might
have
devoted
much
more
time
to
visiting
the
objects
of
interest
we
have
seen
and
which
we
have
been
obliged
to
pass
by
hauser
has
eaten
nothing
and
this
evening
he
told
me
that
he
felt
sick
such
an
acknowledgment
from
him
means
far
more
than
it
would
coming
from
many
another
man
for
i
know
from
intimate
association
with
him
for
eight
years
that
there
is
no
man
in
our
party
who
will
more
uncomplainingly
reconcile
himself
to
the
hardships
and
privations
of
such
a
journey
as
this
and
if
he
is
too
ill
to
travel
morning
and
if
the
rest
of
our
party
think
that
they
ought
to
take
up
the
journey
homeward
i
will
remain
with
him
here
for
a
day
and
as
the
others
will
have
to
search
out
a
path
through
the
fallen
timber
we
can
make
their
two
days
journey
in
one
by
following
their
beaten
trail
without
obstacles
and
overtake
them
by
the
time
they
reach
the
firehole
river
if
they
find
it
at
all
saturday
september
we
were
awakened
before
daylight
this
morning
by
loud
roaring
sounds
proceeding
from
the
hot
springs
close
by
our
camp
some
of
which
were
in
violent
action
though
entirely
quiescent
yesterday
some
of
them
in
which
the
surface
of
the
water
last
night
was
several
feet
below
the
rim
are
now
overflowing
my
saddle
horse
broke
his
lariat
frightened
by
the
roaring
of
the
springs
and
plunged
along
too
near
one
of
them
when
the
surrounding
incrustation
gave
way
and
he
sank
down
to
his
body
but
frantically
extricated
himself
without
standing
upon
the
order
of
his
extrication
but
he
has
cut
his
foot
so
badly
that
i
do
not
think
it
will
be
prudent
to
ride
him
in
his
stead
i
will
ride
my
smaller
pack
horse
who
has
nearly
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
scalding
he
received
on
my
trip
to
brown
mountain
the
hair
has
come
off
his
legs
in
several
places
as
the
result
of
that
mishap
yet
his
wonderful
vitality
always
leaves
him
in
a
cheerful
frame
of
mind
and
ready
for
any
duty
this
has
been
a
gloomy
morning
in
our
camp
for
we
all
have
been
depressed
at
the
thought
of
leaving
the
lake
and
abandoning
the
search
for
everts
we
have
discussed
the
situation
from
every
point
of
view
and
have
tried
to
put
ourselves
in
his
place
and
have
considered
all
the
possibilities
of
fate
that
may
befall
him
at
one
moment
he
may
be
buoyed
up
with
hope
however
faint
at
another
weighed
down
by
despair
and
fear
with
all
their
mental
terrors
has
he
met
death
by
accident
or
may
he
be
injured
and
unable
to
move
and
be
suffering
the
horrors
of
starvation
and
fever
has
he
wandered
aimlessly
hither
and
thither
until
bereft
of
reason
as
i
contemplate
all
these
possibilities
it
is
a
relief
to
think
that
he
may
have
lost
his
life
at
the
hand
of
some
vagabond
indian
as
the
result
of
this
conference
we
have
decided
upon
a
final
plan
of
action
we
will
give
to
gillette
from
our
remnant
of
provisions
ten
days
rations
and
lieutenant
doane
will
detail
privates
moore
and
williamson
with
ten
days
rations
and
the
three
will
continue
the
search
from
this
point
gillette
says
that
with
the
ten
rations
they
can
devote
five
days
to
a
continuous
search
and
the
remaining
five
days
will
be
sufficient
with
forced
traveling
for
them
to
overtake
us
hauser
has
endeavored
to
throw
a
little
cheer
into
the
conference
by
saying
to
gillette
i
think
that
i
should
be
willing
to
take
the
risk
of
spending
ten
days
more
in
this
wilderness
if
i
thought
that
by
so
doing
i
could
find
a
this
provoked
an
uproarious
shout
of
laughter
for
we
well
understood
that
hauser
alluded
to
the
many
social
courtesies
which
gillette
in
helena
had
extended
to
miss
bessie
everts
the
charming
daughter
of
our
lost
comrade
and
one
of
the
most
attractive
of
montana
belles
this
sally
of
hauser
gives
to
me
the
assurance
of
his
own
convalescence
and
if
it
so
happens
that
gillette
finds
everts
we
will
have
the
realization
of
another
image
in
childe
harold
a
rapture
on
the
lonely
shore
w
saturday
september
gillette
moore
and
williamson
left
us
this
morning
about
on
their
final
quest
for
everts
and
the
rest
of
our
party
soon
resumed
our
journey
we
have
traveled
about
twelve
miles
about
of
the
distance
being
through
open
timber
and
the
other
half
over
prostrate
pines
unmarked
by
any
trail
and
through
which
we
found
it
difficult
to
make
our
way
although
the
obstructions
were
not
so
formidable
as
those
on
the
south
shore
of
yellowstone
lake
x
about
noon
we
crossed
a
high
ridge
which
we
had
reached
by
a
steep
ascent
and
on
descending
the
opposite
side
we
saw
upon
our
left
a
large
lake
which
lieutenant
doane
and
some
others
of
our
party
think
is
at
the
head
of
firehole
river
and
they
suggested
that
we
make
our
way
to
this
lake
and
take
as
a
guide
to
the
firehole
the
stream
which
they
believe
will
be
found
flowing
from
it
they
argued
that
by
so
doing
we
would
be
relieved
from
all
uncertainty
concerning
the
course
to
be
pursued
in
order
to
reach
the
firehole
river
but
they
were
easily
persuaded
that
if
the
firehole
does
take
its
rise
in
that
lake
we
can
as
certainly
strike
that
river
by
pursuing
our
present
westwardly
direction
as
if
we
followed
the
plan
suggested
by
them
hauser
and
i
feel
sure
that
this
large
lake
is
the
head
of
snake
river
in
the
afternoon
we
passed
another
ridge
and
descended
into
a
small
open
valley
where
we
found
a
spring
of
good
water
and
where
we
are
now
camped
near
a
very
small
creek
which
runs
in
a
direction
a
little
north
of
west
and
which
i
believe
flows
to
the
firehole
or
the
madison
river
our
direction
of
travel
has
been
governed
somewhat
by
our
compasses
but
we
have
neglected
to
make
allowance
for
the
variation
of
the
magnetic
needle
which
i
think
is
about
twenty
degrees
east
of
the
true
meridian
therefore
in
trying
to
follow
a
westerly
course
we
have
in
reality
taken
a
course
about
twenty
degrees
north
of
west
as
we
passed
the
large
lake
on
our
left
i
observed
that
there
was
no
ridge
of
land
between
us
and
the
lake
therefore
i
believe
that
it
is
in
the
snake
river
valley
and
that
we
have
twice
crossed
the
main
range
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
fact
that
the
snake
river
valley
is
so
readily
accessible
from
yellowstone
lake
gives
me
hope
that
everts
may
have
made
his
way
out
of
the
forest
to
some
settlement
in
the
snake
river
valley
there
is
still
four
or
five
inches
of
snow
on
the
ground
but
there
is
plenty
of
long
grass
under
it
and
our
horses
are
faring
tolerably
well
and
will
soon
fill
themselves
with
either
grass
or
snow
there
is
no
clear
space
large
enough
for
us
to
pitch
our
tent
we
have
had
our
supper
an
indifferent
and
scanty
meal
and
each
man
is
now
seeking
with
varied
success
a
dry
spot
beneath
the
sheltering
branches
of
the
pines
whereon
to
spread
his
blankets
some
of
our
party
seem
terribly
fatigued
and
others
mentally
depressed
the
question
of
our
present
locality
is
still
unsolved
in
their
minds
and
has
been
intensified
by
the
discussions
in
camp
as
to
whether
or
not
the
large
lake
we
saw
discharges
its
waters
into
the
snake
river
and
they
ask
if
it
does
so
have
we
the
main
range
to
the
eastern
slope
for
myself
i
do
not
know
of
any
day
since
we
left
home
when
i
have
been
in
better
spirits
i
am
sure
we
are
on
the
right
course
and
feel
no
anxiety
the
sky
is
clear
and
cloudless
but
the
snow
is
melting
fast
and
there
is
a
peculiar
odor
in
the
air
that
gives
assurance
of
rain
before
morning
hedges
my
bed
fellow
and
i
have
selected
our
sleeping
place
and
i
have
placed
over
it
a
supported
by
branches
of
a
tree
and
have
erected
a
wickiup
of
green
pine
boughs
overlapping
like
a
thatched
roof
which
will
turn
off
the
rain
if
it
comes
and
i
have
advised
the
others
of
our
party
to
make
similar
preparations
for
a
rain
hedges
says
that
he
feels
worried
and
very
much
discouraged
sunday
september
there
occurred
a
half
hour
ago
the
first
serious
mishap
affecting
the
welfare
of
the
entire
party
and
while
the
packers
bean
and
reynolds
are
repairing
the
damage
resulting
therefrom
i
will
go
back
a
few
hours
and
chronicle
in
the
order
of
their
occurrence
the
events
of
the
early
morning
hedges
and
i
sleeping
securely
under
the
sheltering
roof
of
our
wickiup
were
aroused
from
our
sweet
dreams
of
home
about
this
morning
by
several
members
of
our
party
who
sought
shelter
from
the
rain
which
came
down
abundantly
or
as
a
westmoreland
deacon
used
to
say
in
cupious
perfusion
the
rain
storm
broke
about
in
the
morning
and
all
of
the
party
except
hedges
and
myself
were
well
drenched
as
their
only
protection
from
the
rain
was
their
blankets
an
effort
had
been
made
by
some
of
the
party
to
kindle
a
fire
under
the
shelter
of
a
large
standing
tree
but
with
indifferent
success
hedges
and
i
crawled
out
of
our
dry
blankets
and
sat
upright
so
as
to
make
as
much
room
as
possible
for
the
others
and
we
welcomed
all
our
comrades
to
our
dry
shelter
general
washburn
who
is
suffering
somewhat
from
a
cold
was
especially
grateful
for
the
protection
from
the
storm
which
continued
until
about
the
roof
of
our
wickiup
had
completely
protected
hedges
and
myself
from
the
rain
except
at
one
spot
directly
over
hedges
exposed
ear
where
a
displacement
of
the
pine
leaves
allowed
a
small
stream
to
trickle
through
the
roof
filling
his
ear
with
water
much
to
his
discomfort
some
members
of
our
party
at
our
early
breakfast
this
morning
sitting
upon
logs
at
various
distances
from
our
camp
fire
in
their
clothing
and
eating
their
scanty
meal
in
silence
presented
a
sorry
appearance
some
are
disappointed
that
we
did
not
last
night
reach
the
firehole
river
or
some
large
branch
of
the
madison
which
may
guide
us
homeward
and
are
wondering
if
we
are
moving
in
the
right
direction
i
feel
so
perfectly
confident
that
we
are
traveling
the
right
course
that
i
am
in
the
best
of
spirits
it
may
be
that
my
cheerfulness
is
owing
in
some
degree
to
my
having
dry
clothing
and
a
dry
skin
which
few
of
my
comrades
have
but
i
see
no
reason
for
discouragement
i
think
that
hauser
is
the
best
and
most
accurate
judge
of
distances
of
heights
of
mountains
and
direction
of
travel
of
any
man
i
know
and
he
does
not
doubt
that
we
are
moving
in
the
right
direction
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
have
my
opinion
confirmed
by
his
judgment
illustration
nathaniel
langford
we
had
just
finished
our
breakfast
a
half
hour
ago
when
something
some
wild
animal
or
perhaps
a
snake
moving
in
the
brush
near
where
our
horses
were
picketed
frightened
three
of
them
and
in
their
violent
plunging
they
pulled
up
the
iron
picket
pins
attached
to
their
lariats
and
dashed
at
a
gallop
directly
through
our
camp
over
the
campfire
and
upsetting
and
scattering
hither
and
thither
our
cooking
utensils
the
iron
picket
pins
flying
through
the
air
at
the
lariat
ends
narrowly
missed
several
of
our
party
but
became
entangled
with
the
only
two
sound
pack
saddles
remaining
of
the
entire
number
with
which
we
started
and
dashed
them
against
the
adjacent
trees
tearing
off
the
side
pieces
of
the
saddletrees
and
rendering
them
useless
our
first
thought
was
that
the
damage
done
was
beyond
repair
we
had
however
a
few
thin
boards
the
remnants
of
our
canned
goods
boxes
and
from
my
seamless
sack
of
personal
baggage
i
produced
two
gimlets
a
screwdriver
a
pair
of
nippers
some
wrought
nails
and
two
dozens
of
screws
of
various
sizes
when
all
these
things
were
laid
out
my
comrades
expressed
great
surprise
for
not
one
of
them
or
the
packers
had
any
idea
that
there
were
any
tools
or
screws
in
our
outfit
on
the
other
hand
it
is
a
matter
of
surprise
to
me
that
i
am
the
only
member
of
our
party
who
has
a
rubber
coat
or
a
pair
of
boots
or
who
has
brought
with
him
any
medicines
tools
screws
etc
and
except
myself
there
is
but
one
member
of
our
party
whom
i
will
not
give
away
by
here
recording
his
name
who
had
the
foresight
to
bring
with
him
a
flask
of
whiskey
i
think
we
will
be
known
among
those
who
will
hereafter
visit
this
marvelous
region
as
the
temperance
party
though
some
of
our
number
who
lacked
the
foresight
to
provide
before
leaving
helena
a
needed
remedy
for
snake
bites
have
not
lacked
the
hindsight
required
in
using
it
bean
and
reynolds
have
just
announced
that
the
pack
saddles
have
been
repaired
and
that
preparations
are
being
made
for
the
start
so
on
this
hint
i
suspend
my
record
until
night
sunday
september
we
left
our
morning
camp
about
pursuing
our
uncertain
course
through
fallen
timber
for
a
distance
of
about
three
miles
when
we
had
all
our
fears
of
misdirection
relieved
by
coming
suddenly
upon
the
banks
of
the
firehole
river
the
largest
fork
of
the
madison
down
which
we
followed
five
miles
passing
several
groups
of
boiling
springs
and
a
beautiful
cascade
y
to
which
we
gave
no
name
when
we
emerged
from
the
dense
forest
into
a
sequestered
basin
two
miles
above
the
union
of
the
firehole
river
with
a
stream
which
comes
in
from
the
southwest
the
basin
extending
to
the
width
of
a
mile
and
traversing
the
river
until
contracted
between
proximate
ranges
two
miles
below
our
camp
i
have
spent
the
entire
afternoon
and
part
of
this
evening
in
examining
the
geysers
and
springs
but
will
not
further
record
the
explorations
of
until
we
are
ready
to
leave
the
basin
monday
september
when
we
left
yellowstone
lake
two
days
ago
the
desire
for
home
had
superceeded
all
thought
of
further
explorations
five
days
of
rapid
travel
would
we
believed
bring
us
to
the
upper
valley
of
the
madison
and
within
miles
of
virginia
city
and
we
indulged
the
remote
hope
that
we
might
there
find
some
trace
of
everts
we
had
within
a
distance
of
fifty
miles
seen
what
we
believed
to
be
the
greatest
wonders
on
the
continent
we
were
convinced
that
there
was
not
on
the
globe
another
region
where
within
the
same
limits
nature
had
crowded
so
much
of
grandeur
and
majesty
with
so
much
of
novelty
and
wonder
judge
then
of
our
astonishment
on
entering
this
basin
to
see
at
no
great
distance
before
us
an
immense
body
of
sparkling
water
projected
suddenly
and
with
terrific
force
into
the
air
to
the
height
of
over
one
hundred
feet
we
had
found
a
real
geyser
in
the
valley
before
us
were
a
thousand
hot
springs
of
various
sizes
and
character
and
five
hundred
craters
jetting
forth
vapor
in
one
place
the
eye
followed
through
crevices
in
the
crust
a
stream
of
hot
water
of
considerable
size
running
at
nearly
right
angles
with
the
river
and
in
a
direction
not
towards
but
away
from
the
stream
we
traced
the
course
of
this
stream
by
the
crevices
in
the
surface
for
twenty
or
thirty
yards
it
is
probable
that
it
eventually
flows
into
the
firehole
but
there
is
nothing
on
the
surface
to
indicate
to
the
beholder
the
course
of
its
underground
passage
to
the
river
on
the
summit
of
a
cone
feet
high
was
a
boiling
spring
seven
feet
in
diameter
surrounded
with
beautiful
incrustations
on
the
slope
of
which
we
gathered
twigs
encased
in
a
crust
a
quarter
of
an
inch
in
thickness
on
an
incrusted
hill
opposite
our
camp
are
four
craters
from
three
to
five
feet
in
diameter
sending
forth
steam
jets
and
water
to
the
height
of
four
or
five
feet
but
the
marvelous
features
of
this
wonderful
basin
are
its
spouting
geysers
of
which
during
our
brief
stay
of
hours
we
have
seen
twelve
in
action
six
of
these
threw
water
to
the
height
of
from
fifteen
to
twenty
feet
but
in
the
presence
of
others
of
immense
dimensions
they
soon
ceased
to
attract
attention
of
the
latter
six
the
one
we
saw
in
action
on
entering
the
basin
ejected
from
a
crevice
of
irregular
form
and
about
four
feet
long
by
three
wide
a
column
of
water
of
corresponding
magnitude
to
the
height
of
one
hundred
feet
around
this
crevice
or
mouth
the
sediment
is
piled
in
many
capricious
shapes
chiefly
indented
globules
from
six
inches
to
two
feet
in
diameter
little
hollows
in
the
crust
filled
with
water
contained
small
white
spheres
of
tufa
of
the
size
of
a
nutmeg
formed
as
it
seemed
to
me
around
some
nuclei
z
we
gave
such
names
to
those
of
the
geysers
which
we
saw
in
action
as
we
think
will
best
illustrate
their
peculiarities
the
one
i
have
just
described
general
washburn
has
named
old

because
of
the
regularity
of
its
eruptions
the
intervals
between
which
being
from
sixty
to
minutes

thrown
at
each

old
faithful
named
by
general
washburn
the
grotto
so
named
from
the
singularly
winding
apertures
penetrating
the
sinter
surrounding
it
was
at
rest
when
we
first
discovered
it
externally
it
presented
few
indications
of
its
character
as
a
geyser
private
williamson
one
of
our
escort
crawled
through
an
aperture
and
looked
into
the
discharging
orifice
when
afterwards
he
saw
it
belching
forth
a
column
of
boiling
water
two
feet
in
diameter
to
the
height
of
sixty
feet
and
a
scalding
stream
of
two
hundred
square
inches
flowing
from
the
cavern
he
had
entered
a
short
time
before
he
said
that
he
felt
like
one
who
had
narrowly
escaped
being
summarily
cooked
the
castle
is
on
the
summit
of
an
incrusted
elevation
this
name
was
given
because
of
its
resemblance
to
the
ruins
of
some
old
tower
with
its
broken
down
turrets
the
silicious
sinter
composing
the
formation
surrounding
it
takes
the
form
of
small
globules
resembling
a
ripe
cauliflower
and
the
massive
nodules
indicate
that
at
some
former
period
the
flow
of
water
must
have
been
much
larger
than
at
present
the
jet
is
sixty
feet
high
by
four
feet
in
diameter
and
the
vent
near
it
which
is
in
angry
ebullition
during
the
eruption
constantly
flows
with
boiling
water
one
of
the
most
wonderful
of
the
springs
in
this
basin
is
that
of
hue
directly
in
front
of
the
castle
geyser
it
is
nearly
round
having
diameters
of
about
twenty
and
feet
the
sides
being
corrugated
and
and
at
the
depth
of
thirty
feet
opening
out
into
a
cavern
of
unfathomable
depth
the
rim
of
the
spring
having
beautifully
escalloped
edges
it
does
not
boil
over
but
a
very
small
stream
of
water
flows
from
it
and
it
is
not
affected
in
its
appearance
by
the
spouting
of
the
geyser
in
its
immediate
proximity
there
is
evidently
no
connection
between
this
spring
and
the
geyser
the
giant
is
a
rugged
deposit
presenting
in
form
a
miniature
model
of
the
colosseum
it
has
an
opening
three
feet
in
diameter
a
remarkable
characteristic
of
this
geyser
is
the
duration
of
its
discharges
which
yesterday
afternoon
continued
for
more
than
an
hour
in
a
steady
stream
about
three
feet
in
diameter
and
one
hundred
and
forty
feet
high
opposite
our
camp
on
the
east
side
of
the
firehole
river
is
a
symmetrical
cone
resembling
an
straw
beehive
with
the
top
cut
off
it
is
about
five
feet
in
diameter
at
its
base
with
an
irregular
orifice
having
escalloped
edges
and
of
by
inches
interior
diameter
no
one
supposed
that
it
was
a
geyser
and
until
this
morning
among
so
many
wonders
it
had
escaped
a
second
notice
suddenly
while
we
were
at
breakfast
this
morning
a
column
of
water
shot
from
it
which
by
quite
accurate
triangular
measurement
proved
to
be
two
hundred
and
nineteen
feet
in
height
our
method
of
triangulation
was
as
follows
a
point
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
was
marked
which
was
in
a
direct
line
with
a
branch
of
a
tree
near
by
and
of
the
top
of
the
column
of
water
when
at
its
greatest
height
having
obtained
the
perpendicular
height
of
the
branch
of
the
tree
from
the
ground
and
the
distance
from
this
perpendicular
to
the
point
of
observation
and
to
the
geyser
cone
we
were
enabled
to
make
a
very
accurate
calculation
of
the
height
of
the
column
of
water
we
named
this
geyser
the
bee
hive
near
by
is
situated
the
giantess
the
largest
of
all
the
geysers
we
saw
in
eruption
ascending
a
gentle
slope
for
a
distance
of
sixty
yards
we
came
to
a
sink
or
well
of
an
irregular
oval
shape
fifteen
by
twenty
feet
across
into
which
we
could
see
to
the
depth
of
fifty
feet
or
more
but
could
discover
no
water
though
we
could
distinctly
hear
it
gurgling
and
boiling
at
a
fearful
rate
afar
down
this
vertical
cavern
suddenly
it
commenced
spluttering
and
rising
with
incredible
rapidity
causing
a
general
stampede
among
our
company
who
all
moved
around
to
the
windward
side
of
the
geyser
when
the
water
had
risen
within
about
feet
of
the
surface
it
became
stationary
and
we
returned
to
look
down
upon
the
foaming
water
which
occasionally
emitted
hot
jets
nearly
to
the
mouth
of
the
orifice
as
if
tired
of
this
sport
the
water
began
to
ascend
at
the
rate
of
five
feet
in
a
second
and
when
near
the
top
it
was
expelled
with
terrific
momentum
in
a
column
the
full
size
of
the
immense
aperture
to
a
height
of
sixty
feet
the
column
remained
at
this
height
for
the
space
of
about
a
minute
when
from
the
apex
of
this
vast
aqueous
mass
five
lesser
jets
or
round
columns
of
water
varying
in
size
from
six
to
fifteen
inches
in
diameter
shot
up
into
the
atmosphere
to
the
amazing
height
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
this
was
without
exception
the
most
magnificent
phenomenon
i
ever
beheld
we
were
standing
on
the
side
of
the
geyser
exposed
to
the
sun
whose
sparkling
rays
filled
the
ponderous
column
with
what
appeared
to
be
the
clippings
of
a
thousand
rainbows
these
prismatic
illusions
disappeared
only
to
be
succeeded
by
myriads
of
others
which
continually
fluttered
and
sparkled
through
the
spray
during
the
twenty
minutes
the
eruption
lasted
these
lesser
jets
thrown
so
much
higher
than
the
main
column
and
shooting
through
it
doubtless
proceed
from
auxiliary
pipes
leading
into
the
principal
orifice
near
the
bottom
where
the
explosive
force
is
greater
the
minute
globules
into
which
the
spent
column
was
diffused
when
falling
sparkled
like
a
shower
of
diamonds
and
around
every
shadow
produced
by
the
column
of
steam
hiding
the
sun
was
the
halo
so
often
represented
in
paintings
as
encircling
the
head
of
the
savior
we
unhesitatingly
agreed
that
this
was
the
greatest
wonder
of
our
trip
hedges
and
i
forded
the
firehole
river
a
short
distance
below
our
camp
the
current
as
it
dashed
over
the
boulders
was
swift
and
taking
off
our
boots
and
stockings
we
selected
for
our
place
of
crossing
what
seemed
to
be
a
smooth
rock
surface
in
the
bottom
of
the
stream
extending
from
shore
to
shore
when
i
reached
the
middle
of
the
stream
i
paused
a
moment
and
turned
around
to
speak
to
hedges
who
was
about
entering
the
stream
when
i
discovered
from
the
sensation
of
warmth
under
my
feet
that
i
was
standing
upon
an
incrustation
formed
over
a
hot
spring
that
had
its
vent
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
i
exclaimed
to
hedges
here
is
the
river
which
bridger
said
was
at
the
aa
how
many
more
geysers
than
those
we
saw
in
eruption
there
are
in
this
remarkable
basin
it
is
impossible
to
determine
we
will
be
compelled
reluctantly
to
leave
it
before
it
can
be
half
explored
at
least
a
thousand
pipes
rise
to
the
plain
one
or
two
hundred
of
which
to
all
appearances
are
as
likely
to
be
geysers
as
any
we
have
seen
this
entire
country
is
seemingly
under
a
constant
and
active
internal
pressure
from
volcanic
forces
which
seek
relief
through
the
numberless
springs
jets
volcanoes
and
geysers
exhibited
on
its
surface
and
which
but
for
these
vents
might
burst
forth
in
one
terrific
eruption
and
form
a
volcano
of
vast
dimensions
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
many
of
the
objects
we
see
are
of
recent
formation
and
that
many
of
the
extinguished
craters
recently
ceased
their
condition
of
activity
they
are
constantly
breaking
forth
often
assuming
new
forms
and
attesting
to
the
active
presence
of
volcanic
force
the
water
in
some
of
the
springs
presents
to
the
eye
the
colors
of
all
the
precious
gems
known
to
commerce
in
one
spring
the
hue
is
like
that
of
an
emerald
in
another
like
that
of
the
turquoise
another
has
the
hue
of
the
sapphire
another
has
the
color
of
the
topaz
and
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
the
names
of
these
jewels
may
very
properly
be
given
to
many
of
these
springs
the
packers
with
the
pack
train
and
several
of
our
party
broke
camp
at
this
morning
a
few
of
us
remaining
for
an
hour
hoping
to
have
another
view
of
an
eruption
of
the
giantess
but
in
this
we
were
disappointed
for
it
gave
no
sign
of
an
eruption
save
that
the
water
visible
generally
at
a
depth
of
about
twenty
feet
would
rise
suddenly
eight
or
ten
feet
in
the
well
and
as
suddenly
fall
again
we
moved
down
the
river
on
the
east
bank
part
of
the
way
through
an
open
valley
and
part
through
fallen
timber
at
about
eight
miles
we
came
upon
an
enormous
spring
of
dark
blue
water
the
largest
we
have
seen
hauser
measured
it
and
says
it
is
four
hundred
feet
in
diameter
the
mineral
solution
has
been
deposited
by
the
overflow
on
all
sides
for
two
hundred
yards
the
spring
itself
being
thirty
feet
above
the
general
level
of
the
valley
out
near
the
center
of
the
lake
the
water
boils
up
a
few
feet
but
without
any
especial
violent
action
the
lake
has
no
outlet
but
overflows
on
many
sides
the
water
flowing
down
the
slopes
of
the
incrusted
mound
about
of
an
inch
deep
as
we
stood
on
the
margin
of
this
immense
lake
a
small
flock
of
ducks
came
sailing
down
as
if
to
alight
but
as
they
skimmed
the
water
a
few
inches
above
the
surface
they
seemed
to
scent
danger
and
with
rapid
flapping
of
their
wings
all
except
one
rose
into
the
air
this
one
in
his
descent
had
gained
too
great
an
impetus
to
check
his
progress
and
came
down
into
the
water
and
his
frantic
efforts
to
rise
again
were
futile
and
with
one
or
two
loud
squawks
of
distress
which
were
responded
to
by
his
mates
who
had
escaped
he
was
in
a
moment
a
dead
duck
we
gave
no
name
to
this
lake
ab
about
one
hundred
yards
from
the
lake
on
the
side
towards
the
river
the
incrustation
breaks
off
perpendicularly
and
another
large
lake
is
formed
the
surface
of
which
is
about
fifteen
feet
below
the
upper
and
larger
lake
there
are
a
few
other
springs
near
the
river
farther
down
the
stream
jake
smith
for
the
first
time
on
this
trip
selected
at
this
large
lake
a
curious
specimen
of
tufa
it
was
a
circumstance
so
unusual
that
hedges
called
our
attention
to
it
but
as
smith
was
riding
along
holding
his
treasure
carefully
in
his
hand
his
horse
stumbled
and
he
accidentally
dropped
his
specimen
and
with
a
remark
which
i
will
not
here
record
and
which
is
at
variance
with
his
own
bible
instruction
he
denounced
as
worthless
all
the
specimens
of
the
party
which
he
had
seen
and
inveighed
against
the
folly
of
spending
any
time
in
gathering
them
from
this
point
we
passed
down
the
valley
close
by
the
bank
of
the
river
the
valley
on
our
right
was
very
marshy
and
we
saw
at
a
considerable
distance
one
very
large
fountain
of
water
spouting
into
the
atmosphere
to
a
considerable
height
and
many
steam
jets
but
owing
to
the
swampy
character
of
the
ground
we
did
not
visit
them
ac
when
we
left
helena
on
august
we
believed
that
days
would
be
the
limit
of
time
which
would
be
consumed
before
our
return
but
to
meet
all
exigencies
we
laid
in
a
thirty
days
supply
of
provisions
we
have
now
been
absent
days
and
as
we
cached
some
of
our
supply
on
yellowstone
lake
for
everts
relief
we
are
now
on
short
rations
but
the
fish
we
dried
while
camped
on
yellowstone
lake
are
doing
good
service
while
riding
alongside
of
stickney
and
bemoaning
the
lack
in
our
larder
of
many
articles
of
food
such
as
sugar
coffee
and
tea
the
supply
of
which
has
become
exhausted
i
asked
him
if
he
was
fond
of
maple
sugar
and
would
like
a
lump
of
it
he
requested
me
not
to
tantalize
him
by
mentioning
the
subject
whereupon
i
astonished
him
by
producing
a
goodly
sized
cake
which
i
had
brought
with
me
from
helena
and
which
for
five
weeks
i
had
preserved
untouched
in
my
seamless
sack
it
was
enjoyed
by
all
who
shared
it
but
stickney
was
especially
grateful
for
his
division
of
the
sweet
morsel
and
received
it
gratefully
and
gracefully
and
seemingly
without
reluctance
at
the
same
time
remarking
you
are
always
doing
something
to
make
me
laugh
and
added
you
always
seem
to
have
another
card
up
your
sleeve
when
an
emergency
arises
by
this
last
figure
of
speech
he
delicately
suggested
to
me
the
methods
adopted
by
jake
smith
in
playing
poker
ad
we
have
traveled
about
eighteen
miles
crossing
just
before
the
day
closed
a
timbered
ridge
and
we
are
now
camped
at
the
junction
of
the
firehole
river
with
a
stream
coming
into
it
from
the
east
nearly
as
large
as
the
firehole
but
to
which
we
have
given
no
name
ae
tuesday
september
we
broke
camp
at
half
past
nine
traveling
along
the
rocky
edge
of
the
river
bank
by
the
rapids
passing
thence
through
a
beautiful
pine
wood
and
over
a
long
stretch
of
fallen
timber
blackened
by
fire
for
about
four
miles
when
we
again
reached
the
river
which
here
bends
in
a
westerly
direction
lieutenant
doane
and
i
climbed
to
the
top
of
one
of
the
two
prominent
hills
on
our
course
and
had
a
fine
view
of
the
country
for
the
distance
of
thirty
miles
last
night
and
also
this
morning
in
camp
the
entire
party
had
a
rather
unusual
discussion
the
proposition
was
made
by
some
member
that
we
utilize
the
result
of
our
exploration
by
taking
up
quarter
sections
of
land
at
the
most
prominent
points
of
interest
and
a
general
discussion
followed
one
member
of
our
party
suggested
that
if
there
could
be
secured
by
a
good
title
to
two
or
three
quarter
sections
of
land
opposite
the
lower
fall
of
the
yellowstone
and
extending
down
the
river
along
the
cañon
they
would
eventually
become
a
source
of
great
profit
to
the
owners
another
member
of
the
party
thought
that
it
would
be
more
desirable
to
take
up
a
quarter
section
of
land
at
the
upper
geyser
basin
for
the
reason
that
that
locality
could
be
more
easily
reached
by
tourists
and
pleasure
seekers
a
third
suggestion
was
that
each
member
of
the
party
a
claim
and
in
order
that
no
one
should
have
an
advantage
over
the
others
the
whole
should
be
thrown
into
a
common
pool
for
the
benefit
of
the
entire
party
hedges
then
said
that
he
did
not
approve
of
any
of
these
plans
that
there
ought
to
be
no
private
ownership
of
any
portion
of
that
region
but
that
the
whole
of
it
ought
to
be
set
apart
as
a
great
national
park
and
that
each
one
of
us
ought
to
make
an
effort
to
have
this
accomplished
his
suggestion
met
with
an
instantaneous
and
favorable
response
from
all
except
one
of
the
members
of
our
party
and
each
hour
since
the
matter
was
first
broached
our
enthusiasm
has
increased
it
has
been
the
main
theme
of
our
conversation
as
we
journeyed
i
lay
awake
half
of
last
night
thinking
about
it
and
if
my
wakefulness
deprived
my
hedges
of
any
sleep
he
has
only
himself
and
his
disturbing
national
park
proposition
to
answer
for
it
our
purpose
to
create
a
park
can
only
be
accomplished
by
untiring
work
and
concerted
action
in
a
warfare
against
the
incredulity
and
unbelief
of
our
national
legislators
when
our
proposal
shall
be
presented
for
their
approval
nevertheless
i
believe
we
can
win
the
battle
i
do
not
know
of
any
portion
of
our
country
where
a
national
park
can
be
established
furnishing
to
visitors
more
wonderful
attractions
than
here
these
wonders
are
so
different
from
anything
we
have
ever
seen
they
are
so
various
so
extensive
that
the
feeling
in
my
mind
from
the
moment
they
began
to
appear
until
we
left
them
has
been
one
of
intense
surprise
and
of
incredulity
every
day
spent
in
surveying
them
has
revealed
to
me
some
new
beauty
and
now
that
i
have
left
them
i
begin
to
feel
a
skepticism
which
clothes
them
in
a
memory
clouded
by
doubt
wednesday
september
we
broke
camp
soon
after
traveling
northwesterly
down
the
stream
which
at
six
miles
entered
a
cañon
extending
ten
miles
in
a
very
tortuous
course
the
stream
gradually
bending
to
the
west
the
sides
of
the
cañon
are
steep
and
a
great
many
small
lateral
streams
flow
into
it
forming
cascades
of
remarkable
beauty
there
are
also
many
springs
gushing
out
from
the
sides
of
the
cañon
afar
up
below
the
cañon
we
traveled
over
a
high
ridge
for
the
distance
of
ten
miles
and
camped
in
a
deep
coulee
where
we
found
good
water
and
an
abundance
of
wood
and
grass
hauser
and
stickney
all
through
the
day
were
a
few
miles
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
the
party
and
just
below
the
mouth
of
the
cañon
they
met
two
men
who
manifested
some
alarm
at
sight
of
them
they
had
a
supply
of
provisions
packed
on
riding
saddles
and
were
walking
beside
their
horses
hauser
told
them
that
they
would
meet
a
large
party
up
the
cañon
but
we
did
not
see
them
and
they
evidently
cached
themselves
as
we
went
by
the
upper
madison
in
this
vicinity
is
said
to
be
a
rendezvous
for
horse
thieves
we
have
traveled
about
miles
as
the
outcome
of
a
general
conversation
i
will
leave
the
party
morning
and
start
for
virginia
city
where
i
have
a
forlorn
hope
that
some
tidings
may
be
had
of
everts
we
think
that
virginia
city
is
not
more
than
thirty
miles
distant
but
as
we
are
not
now
on
any
trail
leading
to
it
i
shall
have
to
take
my
chances
of
finding
it
jake
smith
asked
me
if
i
expected
that
the
readers
of
my
diary
would
believe
what
i
had
written
he
said
that
he
had
kept
no
diary
for
the
reason
that
our
discoveries
had
been
of
such
a
novel
character
that
if
he
were
to
write
an
account
of
them
he
would
not
be
believed
by
those
who
read
his
record
and
he
would
be
set
down
as
a
liar
he
said
that
he
did
not
mind
being
called
a
liar
by
those
who
had
known
him
well
for
many
years
but
he
would
not
allow
strangers
that
privilege
this
ambiguous
remark
indicates
that
jake
has
more
wit
and
philosophy
than
i
have
given
him
the
credit
of
possessing
thursday
september
virginia
with
a
small
supply
of
needed
creature
comforts
lunch
etc
i
left
the
party
early
this
morning
uncertain
as
to
the
time
which
would
be
required
to
take
me
to
virginia
city
about
noon
i
met
a
horseman
who
had
left
virginia
city
this
morning
who
directed
me
to
the
trail
leading
to
the
town
he
paused
long
enough
to
let
me
scan
a
newspaper
which
he
had
from
which
i
learned
of
the
capitulation
of
the
french
at
sedan
i
asked
him
to
hand
the
newspaper
to
general
washburn
whose
party
he
would
meet
in
the
madison
valley
he
said
that
he
would
stop
at
the
cabin
of
bannack
george
the
distance
from
our
morning
camp
to
this
place
is
much
farther
than
we
thought
and
it
was
this
evening
before
i
reached
virginia
city
nothing
has
been
heard
of
everts
and
his
friends
are
shocked
at
the
intelligence
of
his
loss
from
our
party
owing
to
the
late
hour
of
my
arrival
i
have
met
but
few
of
my
old
acquaintances
but
these
are
greatly
interested
in
the
result
of
our
explorations
and
i
have
promised
to
remain
here
another
day
before
starting
for
helena
and
give
them
a
further
description
of
what
i
have
seen
i
have
enjoyed
one
good
square
meal
tuesday
september
i
reached
helena
last
night
the
intelligence
of
my
arrival
in
virginia
city
and
of
the
loss
of
everts
from
our
party
had
been
telegraphed
to
helena
from
virginia
city
and
on
my
arrival
i
was
besieged
by
many
of
the
friends
of
everts
for
information
concerning
the
manner
in
which
he
became
separated
from
our
party
i
have
spent
the
larger
part
of
this
day
in
describing
the
many
wonders
which
we
found
on
our
trip
and
i
shall
be
most
glad
to
have
a
few
days
rest
and
put
on
some
of
my
lost
flesh
at
the
outset
of
this
journey
i
tipped
the
beam
of
the
scales
at
a
little
over
one
hundred
and
ninety
pounds
and
i
weigh
but
one
hundred
and
pounds
a
loss
of
pounds
one
of
my
friends
says
that
i
may
consider
myself
fortunate
in
bringing
back
to
civilization
as
much
of
my
body
as
i
did
i
have
already
received
several
invitations
from
householders
to
meet
their
families
and
friends
at
their
homes
and
tell
them
of
our
trip
but
the
present
dilapidated
condition
of
my
toilet
renders
it
necessary
for
me
to
decline
their
hospitalities
until
some
future
period
my
first
duty
to
myself
and
my
fellow
citizens
is
to
seek
a
tailor
and
replenish
my
wardrobe
jake
smith
is
the
only
one
of
our
party
who
has
returned
with
a
garment
fit
to
wear
in
the
society
of
ladies
my
narrations
have
excited
great
wonder
and
i
can
not
resist
the
conviction
that
many
of
my
auditors
believe
that
i
have
drawn
a
long
bow
in
my
descriptions
i
am
perfectly
free
to
acknowledge
that
this
does
not
surprise
me
it
seems
a
most
natural
thing
for
them
to
do
so
for
in
the
midst
of
my
narrations
i
find
myself
almost
as
ready
to
doubt
the
reality
of
the
scenes
i
have
attempted
to
describe
as
the
most
skeptical
of
my
listeners
they
pass
along
my
memory
like
the
faintly
defined
outlines
of
a
dream
and
when
i
dwell
upon
their
strange
peculiarities
their
vastness
their
variety
and
the
distinctive
features
of
novelty
which
mark
them
all
so
entirely
out
of
the
range
of
all
objects
that
compose
the
natural
scenery
and
wonders
of
this
continent
i
who
have
seen
them
can
scarcely
realize
that
in
those
recesses
of
the
mountains
they
have
existed
so
long
in
impenetrable
seclusion
and
that
hereafter
they
will
stand
foremost
among
the
natural
attractions
of
the
world
astonishment
and
wonder
become
so
firmly
impressed
upon
the
mind
in
the
presence
of
these
objects
that
belief
stands
appalled
and
incredulity
is
dumb
you
can
see
niagara
comprehend
its
beauties
and
carry
from
it
a
memory
ever
ready
to
summon
before
you
all
its
grandeur
you
can
stand
in
the
valley
of
the
yosemite
and
look
up
its
mile
of
vertical
granite
and
distinctly
recall
its
minutest
feature
but
amid
the
cañon
and
falls
the
boiling
springs
and
sulphur
mountain
and
above
all
the
mud
volcano
and
the
geysers
of
the
yellowstone
your
memory
becomes
filled
and
clogged
with
objects
new
in
experience
wonderful
in
extent
and
possessing
unlimited
grandeur
and
beauty
it
is
a
new
phase
in
the
natural
world
a
fresh
exhibition
of
the
handiwork
of
the
great
architect
and
while
you
see
and
wonder
you
seem
to
need
an
additional
sense
fully
to
comprehend
and
believe

point
to
interpolate
an
account
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
name
tower
was
bestowed
upon
the
creek
and
fall
at
the
outset
of
our
journey
we
had
agreed
that
we
would
not
give
to
any
object
of
interest
which
we
might
discover
the
name
of
any
of
our
party
nor
of
our
friends
this
rule
was
to
be
religiously
observed
while
in
camp
on
sunday
august
on
the
bank
of
this
creek
it
was
suggested
that
we
select
a
name
for

some
discussion
a
vote
was
taken
and
by
a
small
majority
the
name
minaret
was
decided
upon

the
following
evening
hauser
stated
with
great
seriousness
that
we
had
violated
the
agreement
made
relative
to
naming
objects
for
our
friends
he
said
that
the
well
known
southern
family
the
rhetts
lived
in
louis
and
that
they
had
a
most
charming
and
accomplished
daughter
named
minnie

said
that
this
daughter
was
a
sweetheart
of
trumbull
who
had
proposed
the
name
her
name
minnie
rhett

that
we
had
unwittingly
given
to
the
fall

creek
the
name
of
this
sweetheart
of
trumbull
trumbull
indignantly
denied
the
truth
of
hauser
statement
and
hauser
as
determinedly
insisted
that
it
was
the
truth
and
the
vote
was
therefore
reconsidered
and
by
a
substantial
majority
it
was
decided
to
substitute
the
name
tower
for
minaret
later
and
when
it
was
too
late
to
recall
or
reverse
the
action
of
our

it
was
surmised
that
hauser
himself
had
a
sweetheart
in
louis
a
miss
tower
some
of
our
party
walter
trumbull

always
insisted

j
hayden
geologist
in
charge
of
the
geological
survey
first
visited
this
region
in
the
summer
of
the
year
following
the
visit
of
the
washburn
party
whose
discoveries
and
explorations
are
recorded
in

hayden
on

graphically
described
the
various
wonders
which
he
saw
but
had
very
little
to
say
concerning
the
mud
volcano
this
fact
was
the
more
inexplicable
to
me
for
the
reason
that
the
washburn
party
thought
it
one
of
the
most
remarkable
curiosities
to
be
found
in
that

hayden
first
visit
i
again
visited
the
volcano
and
the
omission
by
hayden
was
explained
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
volcano
in
its
changed
condition
the
loud
detonations
which
resembled
the
discharges
of
a
mortar
were
no
longer
heard
and
the
upper
part
of
the
crater
and
cone
had
in
a
great
measure
disappeared
leaving
a
shapeless
and
unsightly
hole
much
larger
than
the
former
crater
in
which
large
were
swaying
to
and
fro
in
the
gurgling
mass
forty
feet
below
the
whole
appearance
bearing
testimony
to
the
terrible
nature
of
the
convulsion
which
wrought
such
destruction
lieutenant
doane
in
his
official
report
to
the
war
department
thus
describes
the
volcano
as
it
appeared
in
a
few
hundred
yards
from
here
is
an
object
of
the
greatest
interest
on
the
slope
of
a
small
and
steep
wooded
ravine
is
the
crater
of
a
mud
volcano
feet
in
diameter
at
the
rim
which
is
elevated
a
few
feet
above
the
surface
on
the
lower
side
and
bounded
by
the
slope
of
the
hill
on
the
upper
converging
as
it
deepens
to
the
diameter
of
feet
at
the
lowest
visible
point
about
feet
down
heavy
volumes
of
steam
escape
from
this
opening
ascending
to
the
height
of
feet
from
far
down
in
the
earth
came
a
jarring
sound
in
regular
beats
of
five
seconds
with
a
concussion
that
shook
the
ground
at
yards
distance
after
each
concussion
came
a
splash
of
mud
as
if
thrown
to
a
great
height
sometimes
it
could
be
seen
from
the
edge
of
the
crater
but
none
was
entirely
ejected
while
we
were
there
occasionally
an
explosion
was
heard
like
the
bursting
of
heavy
guns
behind
an
embankment
and
causing
the
earth
to
tremble
for
a
mile
around
the
distance
to
which
this
mud
had
been
thrown
is
truly
astonishing
the
ground
and
falling
trees
near
by
were
splashed
at
a
horizontal
distance
of
feet
the
trees
below
were
either
broken
down
or
their
branches
festooned
with
dry
mud
which
appeared
in
the
tops
of
the
trees
growing
on
the
side
hill
from
the
same
level
with
the
crater
feet
in
height
and
at
a
distance
of
feet
from
the
volcano
the
mud
to
produce
such
effects
must
have
been
thrown
to
a
perpendicular
elevation
of
at
least
feet
it
was
with
difficulty
we
could
believe
the
evidence
of
our
senses
and
only
after
the
most
careful
measurements
could
we
realize
the
immensity
of
this
wonderful
phenomenon
the
visitor
to
the
park
who
has
read
the
description
given
by
washburn
hedges
doane
or
myself
of
the
mud
volcano
as
it
appeared
in
will
readily
perceive
that
it
has
undergone
a
great
change
since
the
time
of
its
first
discovery
in
my
account
of
my
trip
made
in
published
in
scribner
now
century
magazine
for
june
i
say
concerning
this
change
a
large
excavation
remained
and
a
seething
bubbling
mass
of
mud
with
several
swaying
to
and
fro
in
the
midst
told
how
terrible
and
how
effectual
must
have
been
the
explosions
which
produced
such
devastation
i
could
not
realize
that
in
this
unsightly
hole
i
beheld
all
that
was
left
of
those
physical
wonders
which
filled
this
extraordinary
region
great
trees
that
then
decorated
the
hillside
were
now
completely
submerged
in
the
boiling
mass
that
remained
the
trees
with
their
green
tops
which
were
visible
in
have
now
entirely
disappeared

any
one
conjecture
what
has
become
of
them

i

on

nine
days

because

difficulties

were
not
great
enough
to
have
prevented
any

easily
accomplished
than
the
travel
over
what
in
effect
is
only
a
spur
but
the
view
from
our
present
camp
settled
the
question
adversely
to
my
opinion
at
once
directly
across
our
route
lies
a
basaltic
ridge
rising
not
less
than
feet
above

vertical

the
efforts
of

one
of

to
reach
the
summit
of
this
range
after
much
toil
he
reached
the
summit
of
a
lofty
cliff
but
it
was
only
to
behold
gigantic
peaks
rising
all
around
and
towering
far
into
the
snowy
regions
of
the
atmosphere
he
soon
found
that
he
had
undertaken
a
tremendous
task
but
the
pride
of
man
is
never
more
obstinate
than
when
climbing
mountains
the
ascent
was
so
steep

rugged
that
he
and
his
companion
were
frequently
obliged
to
clamber
on
hands
and
knees
with
their
guns
slung
upon
their
backs
frequently
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
dripping
with
perspiration
they
threw
themselves
upon
the
snow
and
took
handfuls
of
it
to
allay
their
parching
thirst
at
one
place
they
even
stripped
off
their
coats
and
hung
them
upon
the
bushes
and
thus
lightly
clad
proceeded
to
scramble
over
these
eternal
snows

they
ascended
still
higher
there
were
cool
breezes

refreshed
and
braced
them

p
soon
after
the
return
of
our
party
to

general
washburn
then
of
montana
made
in
his
office
for
the
interior
department
at
washington
a
map
of
the
yellowstone
region
a
copy
of
which
he
gave
to
me
he
told
me
that
in
recognition
of
the
assistance
i
had
rendered
him
in
making
a
fair
outline
of
yellowstone
lake
with
its
indented
shore
and
promontories
he
had
named
for
me
the
mountain
on
the
top
of
which
i
stood
when
i
made
the
sketch
of
the
south
shore
of
the
lake
i
called
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
lieutenant
doane
had
been
my
comrade
in
making
the
ascent
and
suggested
that
doane
name
be
given
to
the
adjoining
peak
on
the
north
he
approved
of
this
suggestion
and
the
map
with
these
mountains
so
named
was
transmitted
to
the
interior
department
hayden
the
geologist
in
charge
of
the
united
states
geological
survey
made
his
first
visit
to
this
region
the
following
year
and
on
the
map
which
he
issued
in
connection
with
his
report
the
name
mount
langford
was
given
to
another
mountain
far
to
the
northeast
since
that
time
my
name
has
again
been
transferred
to
a
mountain
on
the
southeast
i
think
that
hayden
must
have
been
aware
at
that
time
that
this
mountain
bore
my
name
for
he
had
read
the
account
of
the
washburn
exploration
which
was
published
in

for
may
accompanied
by
a
copy
of
the
map
made
by
general
washburn
the
significance
of
connecting
my
name
with
this
mountain
is
centered
in
the
circumstance
that
it
was
intended
to
mark
or
commemorate
an
important
event
that
of
giving
to
the
public
a
very
correct
outline
map
of
yellowstone
lake
in
confirmation
of
the
fact
that
the

degree
of
accuracy
was
made
from

a
character
occurred
soon
after
my
return
to
helena
that
i
can
not
forbear
narrating
it
here
among
the
specimens
of
silica
which
i
brought
home
were
several
dark
globules
about
the
size
of
nutmegs
i
exhibited
these
to
a
noted
physician
of
helena
hovaker
and
soon
after
the
return
of
gillette
from
his
search
for
everts
i
called
upon
him
at
his
store
and
exhibited
to
him
these
specimens
of
silica
at
the
same
time
i
took
a
nutmeg
from
a
box
upon
the
store
counter
and
playfully
asked
gillette
in
the
presence
of
hovaker
if
he
had
found
any
of
those
singular
incrustations
hovaker
believing
of
course
that
the
specimen
i
held
in
my
hand
came
from
the
yellowstone
took
the
nutmeg
and
with
wonder
exhibited
in
every
feature
proceeded
to
give
it
a
critical
examination
frequently
exclaiming
how
very
like
it
is
to
a
nutmeg
he
finally
took
a
nutmeg
from
a
box
near
by
and
balanced
the
supposed
incrustation
with
it
declaring
the
former
to
be
the
lighter
asking
my
permission
to
do
so
he
took
the
nutmeg
which
he
supposed
to
be
an
incrustation
to
a
jeweler
in
the
vicinity
and
broke
it
the
aroma
left
him
no
doubt
as
to
its
character
but
he
was
still
deceived
as
to
its
origin
when
i
saw
him
returning
to
the
store
in
anticipation
of
the
reproof
i
should
receive
i
started
for
the
rear
door
but
the
doctor
entering
before
i
reached
it
called
me
back
and
in
a
most
excited
manner
declared
that
we
had
discovered
real
nutmegs
and
nutmegs
of
a
very
superior
quality
he
had
no
doubt
that
yellowstone
lake
was
surrounded
by
nutmeg
trees
and
that
each
of
our
incrustations
contained
a
veritable
nutmeg
in
his
excitement
he
even
proposed
to
organize
a
small
party
to
go
immediately
to
the
locality
to
gather
nutmegs
and
had
an
interview
with
charley
curtis
on
the
subject
of
furnishing
pack
animals
for
purposes
of
transportation
when
on
the
following
day
he
ascertained
the
truth
after
giving
me
a
characteristic
lecture
he
revenged
himself
by
good
naturedly
conferring
upon
the
members
of
our
party
the
title
by
which
he
always
called
them
thereafter
of
nutmegs

james
bridger
was
famous
for
the
marvelous
stories
he
was
accustomed
to
relate
of
his
mountain
life
and
experiences
he
once
told
me
that
he
had
seen
a
river
which
flowed
so
rapidly
over
the
smooth
surface
of
a
descending
rock
ledge
in
the
bottom
of
the
stream
that
the
water
was
hot
at
the
bottom
my
experience
in
crossing
the
firehole
river
that
day
leads
me
to
believe
that
bridger
had
had
at
some
time
a
similar
experience
he
well
knew
that
heat
and
fire
could
be
produced
by
friction
like
other
mountain
men
he
had
doubtless
many
a
time
produced
a
fire
by
friction
and
he
could
not
account
for
the
existence
of
a
hot
rock
in
the
bed
of
a
cold
stream
except
upon
the
theory
that
the
rapid
flow
of
water
over
the
smooth
surface
evolved
the
heat
by
friction
