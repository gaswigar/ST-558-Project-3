back
in

of

his
broad

even
bulkier
by
the

that
incased

he
was
tensed

quiescent
action
would
be

joined
sixty
miles
away
and
his
own
squadron
was
in
reserve
over
new
york
and
its
bay
the
american
air
fleet
was
in
motion
suddenly
movement
ceased
and
the
formation
froze
ten
flying
forts
were
each
the
apex
of
a
cone
axis
horizontal
whose
body
was
the
fanned
of
its
squadron
of
a
thousand
helicopter
planes
the
cones
bristled
oceanward
from
the
of
new
york
their
points
a
arc
of
defiance
their
bases
tangent
to
one
another
almost
touching
the
ground
at
their
lower
edges
then
circling
upward
for
ten
thousand
feet
from
van
to
rear
each
formation
was
five
miles
in
length
behind
and
above
the
main
body
of
the
fleet
sloped
in
echeloned
ranks
hiding
the
threatened
city
with
an
impenetrable
terraced
wall
of
buzzing
helios
and
massive
forts
up
back
up

the
serried
masses
reached
till
the
rearmost
were
thousand
feet
aloft
and
farther
behind
unmoving
on
their
level
were
the
light
of
the

dane
gazed
down
that
tremendous
vista
to
the
front
line
and
swore
softly
just
his
luck
to
be
out
of
the
scrap
the

would
never
penetrate

general
huntington
voice
sounded
from
his

the
somehow
its
gruffness
overrode
the
mechanical
quality
of
the
radio

almost
it
seemed
he
was
there
in

have
at

peiping
and

and
are
now
ranging
inland
through
enemy
territory
even
through
the
double
leather
of
his
helmet
a
roar
came
to
allan
he
felt
his
craft
vibrate
to
the
exultant
cheers
of
the
fleet
his
own
mouth
was
open
and
his
throat
rasping
the
single
syllable
choked
the
surge
of
sound
london

the

broke
off
and
allan
sensed
dully
that
there
was
other
news
news
that
he
dared
not
give
the

in

pat
on
his
last
word
a
dark
cloud
spread
along
the
horizon
from
the
of
the
cone
formations
great
green
beams
shot
out
across
the
sea
orange
flame
flared
in
answer
all
along
the
black
bank
that
was
the
enemy
fleet
where
the
green
beams
struck
the
orange
blinked
out
and
the
blue
of
sky
showed
through
and
the
american
ships
were
as
yet
untouched
a
great
shout
rose
to
lips
that
they
had
the
range
on
the
enemy
and
the
attack
defeated
before
it
was
well
begun
but
was
it
swift
as
the
american
rays
scythed
destruction
along
the
enemy
line
the
gaps
filled
and
lethal
orange
leaped
out
again
now
the
black
cloud
was
piling
up
was
rising
till
it
was
a
towering
curtain
against
the
sky
on
it
came
like
some
monstrous
tidal
wave
great
rents
were
torn
through
it
by
the
stabbing
beams
of
the
flying
forts
holes
where
ships
and
men
had
been
whiffed
into
dust
by
the
hundred
but
the
attack
came
on
now
all
the
great
defensive
cones
burst
into
an
emerald
blaze
as
the
smaller
ships
loosed
their
bolts
and
from
the
terraced
slope
of
the
supporting
fleet
a
hundred
steel
ovoids
lumbered
forward
to
meet
the
threat
all
the
vast
space
between
the
hosts
from
the
sea
surface
was
filled
with
dazzling
light
now
green
now
orange
as
the
conflicting
beams
crossed
and
mingled
there
were
gaps
in
the
advancing
curtain
that
did
not
fill
but
the
defending
cones
were
melting
away
were
disappearing
were
gone

he
started
when
he
saw
the
v
of
the
chronometer
hands
only
six
minutes
had
passed
since
the
start
it
seemed
hours
and
already
the
reserve
was
being
called
on
he
was
suddenly
cold
out
there
over
the
bay
the
enemy
forces
had
ceased
their
advance
the
american
first
line
cones
were
gone
true
enough
but
the
support
fleet
was
still
intact
some
new
element
had
entered
the

visible
as
yet
only
in
the
powerful

the

again
snapped

dane
jerked
home
his
throttle
the
battle
shot
down
and
his
seat
thrust
up
against
him
something
hurtled
past
blurred
by
the
speed
of
its
descent
the
plane
rocked
to
a
sudden
detonation
and
allan
fought
to
steady
it
then
he
had
reached
the
commanded
height
at
sixty
thousand
feet
the
helio
vanes
were
useless
only
the
power
of
the
auxiliary
maintained
his
altitude
formation
b
engage
the
enemy
came
the
order
they
were
just
ahead
a
dozen
giant
craft
and
the
scarlet
fire
of
their
gas
blasts
holding
them
poised
steady
in
their
line
from
curious
swellings
that
broke
the
clean
lines
of
their
black
spheres
were
dropping
in
steady
streams
allan
knew
then
whence
came
the
crash
that
had
rocked
his
ship
as
she
rose
these
were
bombs
huge
bombs
charged
with
heaven
alone
knew
what
explosive
they
were
catapulting
down
an
iron
death
hail
on
the
fleet
and
the
city
twelve
miles
below
the
enemy
strategy
was
clear
while
his
main
fleet
was
engaging
the
american
defense
in
a
frontal
attack
these
huge
had
looped
unseen
through
the
stratosphere
to
this
point
of
vantage
the
planes
that
had
leaped
to
this
new
menace
swept
toward
the
bombers
in
three
parallel
lines
above
to
right
and
left
of
them
allan
plane
leaping
to
position
at
the
very
end
of
one
long
line
the
three
leaders
reached
the
first
and
their
green
beams
shot
out
in
that
instant
the
enemy
craft
seemed
to
explode
in
intense
blue
light
then
the
awful
dazzle
was
gone
the
rocket
ship
was
there
just
as
before
but
the
american
were
gone
were
wiped
out
as
though
they
had
never
been
the
next
trio
and
the
next
rushed
up
again
and
again
came
that
flash
of
force
annihilating
them
superbly
the
tiny
gnats
that
were
the
american
planes
plunged
headlong
at
the
hovering
leviathan
of
the
air
and
were
whiffed
into
nothingness
sixty
brave
men
were
dancing
motes
of
cosmic
dust
before
the
shocked
commander
could
sound
the
recall
the
helicopter
squadron
curved
away
still
keeping
its
ordered
lines
but
orange
flame
leaped
out
from
all
twelve
of
the
enemy
vessels
orange
flame
that
caught
them
that
ran
along
their
ranks
and
sent
them
hurtling
earthward
blackened
corpses
in
blazing
coffins
abandon
ships
the
adjutant
last
order
crisped
coldly
metallic
soldierly
as
ever
in
the
next
breath
as
allan
reached
for
the
lever
that
would
open
the
trapdoor
beneath
him
he
saw
the
plunge
down
a
flaring
comet
above
allan
dane
the
silk
of
his
parachute
bellied
out
in
the
denser
air
of
the
lower
heights
his
respirator
tube
was
still
in
his
mouth
and
the
double
leather
of
his
safety
suit
had
kept
him
from
freezing
in
the
spatial
cold
of
the
stratosphere
he
looked
south
all
the
proud
thousands
of
the
defense
fleet
were
gone
blown
to
fragments
by
the
time
bombs
from
above
the
city
was
hidden
in
a
thick
fog
queer
the
thought
ran
through
his
brain
that
there
should
be
fog
in
under
a
blazing
sun
then
he
saw
them
the
circling
black
ships
of
the
enemy
trailing
behind
them
long
wakes
of
the
drab
yellow
vapor
that
drifted
heavily
down
to
shroud
new
york
with
gas
allan
felt
nauseated
as
he
imagined
a
fleeting
picture
of
the
city
of
its
streets
with
swarming
myriads
of
slumped
bodies
clogging
the
conveyor
belts
that
still
moved
because
no
hand
was
left
to
shut
them
off
of
women
and
children
and
aged
or
crippled
men
strewn
in
tortured
horrible
attitudes
in
all
the
in
their
homes
in
every
nook
and
cranny
of
the
murdered
city
he
looked
beneath
his
drifting
descent
and
saw
roads
that
were
rivers
alive
with
every
manner
of
fleeing
conveyance
and
he
groaned
knowing
that
in
moments
the
pursuing
ships
would
send
down
their
lethal
mist
to
put
an
end
to
that
futile
flight
sugar
loaf
mountain
rose
toward
him
at
its
very
summit
was
a
clearing
among
the
trees
and
incongruously
motionless
in
that
world
where
every
one
was
rushing
from
inescapable
death
a
man
stood
calmly
there
gazing
up
at
him
allan
screamed
down
to
him
run
you
fool
run
or
the
gas
will
get
you
of
course
the
man
could
not
hear
that
cry
but
one
tiny
arm
rose
and
pointed
south
allan
followed
the
direction
of
the
gesture
and
saw
a
black
plane
veering
toward
him
then
orange
flared
from
it
though
it
was
distant
and
a
wave
of
intolerable
heat
enveloped
him
something
cried
within
him
too
far
he
too
far
off
to
kill
me
with
his
beam
then
he
knew
no
more
from
new
york
from
devastated
san
francisco
from
rio
from
buenos
aires
from
fifty
other
desolated
points
along
the
seaboards
of
the
americas
the
black
fleets
swept
along
the
coasts
and
inland
vomiting
their
yellow
death
till
all
the
continents
were
blanketed
with
gas
and
in
europe
and
australasia
the
destroying
hordes
having
smashed
the
proud
defenses
of
the
coastlines
engaged
in
the
same
pursuit
till
in
one
short
week
all
the
lands
of
the
western
allies
were
swept
clear
of
life
then
the
eastern
ships
turned
homeward
to
wait
until
the
vapor
they
had
strewn
had
lost
its
virulence
and
the
teeming
masses
of
the
east
might
take
possession
of
the
half
world
the
destroyers
had
conquered
the
black
fliers
turned
homeward
but
there
was
no
homeland
left
for
them
to
seek
for
though
the
defense
fleets
of
the
western
coalition
had
been
everywhere
beaten
their
attack
squadrons
had
been
everywhere
successful
all
asia
and
africa
lay
under
a
pall
of
milky
emerald
gas
as
toxic
as
blasting
as
the
easterners
yellow
and
the
westerners
were
returning
too
in
their
teleview
screens
the
commanders
of
the
black
swarms
and
of
the
white
thousands
sought
their
home
ports
and
saw
the
world
to
be
a
sphere
where
not
even
a
fly
could
live
then
as
if
by
common
accord
the
white
ships
and
the
black
sped
across
lifeless
hemispheres
to
meet
in
over
the
long
green
swells
of
the
pacific
they
met
and
on
the
instant
they
were
at
each
throats
like
two
packs
of
wild
dogs
killing
killing
killing
till
they
themselves
were
killed
no
quarter
was
asked
in
that
fight
and
none
given
no
hope
of
victory
was
there
nor
fear
of
defeat
better
swift
death
in
the
high
passion
of
combat
than
slow
hopeless
drifting
over
a
dead
world
but
there
was
one
black
ship
that
slunk
out
of
that
mass
suicide
of
man
last
remnant
within
its
long
hulk
three
motionless
forms
lay
in
a
welter
of
blood
that
smeared
their
officers
badges
and
a
dozen
gibbering
men
labored
at
the
controls
of
their
craft
the
long
black
shadows
came
at
last
to
veil
an
empty
sky
and
a
sea
whereon
there
was
drifting
wreckage
but
not
one
sign
of
any
life
and
as
far
to
the
north
a
shadowed
airship
sped
athwart
the
moon
searching
for
one
spot
one
tiny
patch
of
solid
ground
that
was
free
from
the
dread
gas
consciousness
came
slowly
back
to
allan
dane
at
first
he
was
aware
merely
that
he
was
alive
that
was
astonishing
enough
even
if
the
orange
beam
had
not
killed
him
with
its
heat
the
gas
should
have
struck
his
leather
suit
the
easterners
could
not
be
behind
his
own
forces
in
their
development
of
that
terrible
weapon
allan
felt
a
coolness
on
his
face
his
hands
that
could
mean
only
that
his
helmet
and
gloves
had
been
removed
he
heard
movement
and
opened
his
eyes
at
first
he
could
see
only
blueness
pale
and
lambent
he
gazed
dully
up
at
a
lustrous
glasslike
substance
that
arched
above
him
the
sound
of
some
one
moving
came
again
and
allan
turned
his
head
to
it
his
neck
muscles
seemed
stiff
that
simple
motion
drew
tremendously
on
his
strength
about
fifteen
yards
away
a
man
bent
over
a
transparent
boxlike
contrivance
in
which
something
fluttered
from
this
device
a
metal
tube
angled
away
into
the
wall
there
was
other
apparatus
on
the
long
table
at
which
the
man
was
at
last
clear
at
last
a
mellow
rounded
voice
exclaimed
jubilantly
clear
are
you
sure
anthony
are
you
sure
this
other
voice
throbbing
with
vibrant
repression
as
if
its
owner
feared
to
believe
tidings
come
at
last
was
a
woman
as
the
man
half
turned
its
owner
came
between
him
and
allan
all
he
could
see
of
them
was
that
the
one
called
anthony
was
very
tall
and
thin
and
the
woman
almost
as
tall
and
that
both
wore
hooded
white
robes
the
falling
to
her
heels
the
man
to
his
knees
with
black
cords
look
for
yourself
helen
she
bent
over
the
transparent
cage
oh
anthony
how
wonderful
allan
attempted
to
rise
he
was
unutterably
weak
to
move
a
finger
was
a
gigantic
task
to
do
more
impossible
he
tried
to
call
out
no
sound
came
from
his
straining
throat
the
couple
straightened
the
man
spoke
too
low
for
dane
to
hear
each
took
something
from
the
table
something
that
gleamed
metallically
then
they
turned
and
allan
saw
what
the
white
robes
clothed
skulls
leered
at
him
from
beneath
the
hoods
fleshless
skulls
tinted
a
pale
green
jutting
jawbones
cavernous
cheeks
lipless
mouths
that
grinned
mirthlessly
his
eyes
froze
to
them
and
a
scream
formed
within
him
that
he
could
not
utter
hands
appeared
from
within
the
flowing
sleeves
and
they
were
skeleton
hands
each
phalanx
clearly
marked
they
moved
that
was
the
worst
of
it
the
hands
moved
and
deep
in
the
shadowed
of
the
skulls
blue
light
glowed
in
living
eyes
that
peered
at
something
to
allan
right
his
eyes
followed
the
direction
of
their
gaze
ranged
along
the
wall
and
jutting
out
he
saw
four
couches
on
each
was
a
figure
shrouded
and
hooded
in
white
utterly
still
they
were
and
the
cadaverous
countenances
exposed
between
robe
and
hood
betrayed
not
the
slightest
twitch
the
arms
were
crossed
on
each
breast
allan
realized
that
his
own
arms
were
similarly
crossed
he
looked
down
at
them
saw
the
white
gleam
of
a
robe
that
fell
down
his
length
in
smooth
still
folds
saw
his
hands
greenish
skin
stretched
tight
over
fleshless
bones
suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
air
was
musty
and
fetid
footsteps
slithered
across
the
floor
the
bent
over
the
farthest
couch
with
one
skeleton
hand
she
bared
an
arm
of
the
corpselike
figure
the
other
hand
lifted
metal
glinted
in
it
and
plunged
into
the
unshrinking
limb
a
slow
movement
of
the
bony
fingers
and
the
threadlike
silvery
thing
was
withdrawn
she
stared
ghoulishly
and
the
man
too
gazed
tensely
at
her
victim
a
long
quiver
ran
through
the
recumbent
shape
another
the
on
the
pallet
moved
slightly
and
merciful
blackness
welled
up
in
brain
a
cool
liquid
was
in
his
mouth
he
swallowed
instinctively
and
warmth
ran
through
his
veins
he
felt
strength
flooding
back
into
him
and
he
remembered
horror
that
better
a
mellow
voice
said
close
above
him
drink
just
a
little
more
the
cool
liquid
came
up
against
allan
lips
again
pungent
and
he
drank
once
more
strength
surged
warmingly
within
him
that
a
good
fellow
a
little
more
now
fingers
were
on
allan
wrist
there
was
friendliness
in
the
voice
that
was
speaking
to
him
and
solicitude
he
dared
to
look
a
head
was
right
before
him
but
seen
thus
closely
the
terror
of
it
was
lessened
fleshless
indeed
it
was
but
a
parchment
skin
was
tightly
drawn
over
the
bones
and
allan
could
see
that
its
true
shade
was
a
sere
yellow
it
was
the
bluish
light
that
had
given
it
the
green
of
decay
the
eyes
were
kindly
they
gleamed
with
pleasure
as
allan
opened
and
the
voice
asked
how
do
you
feel
allan
made
shift
to
reply
though
a
strange
lassitude
still
enervated
him
and
his
mouth
was
full
of
tongue
much
better
thank
you
but
who
who
with
a
sudden
access
of
energy
allan
sat
up
on
his
couch
he
looked
about
him
and
his
fears
were
back
full
flood
he
was
in
a
chamber
with
neither
door
nor
window
floor
walls
and
arched
ceiling
entirely
formed
of
the
palely
lustrous
glasslike
substance
the
room
was
perhaps
twenty
by
forty
feet
its
ceiling
curving
to
about
five
yards
from
the
floor
at
its
highest
point
and
the
spectral
blue
glow
that
filled
it
was
apparently
sourceless
it
lit
three
vacant
couches
to
his
left
to
his
right
were
the
four
he
had
already
seen
the
woman
was
ministering
to
the
occupants
of
these
living
skeletons
that
lay
flaccid
but
whose
heads
were
moving
barely
moving
from
side
to
side
like
nothing
else
but
a
sepulcher
the
place
seemed
a
tomb
in
which
the
dead
had
come
to
life
allan
clutched
at
anthony
arm
grasped
textured
fabric
that
was
cold
to
his
frantic
touch
and
thin
bone
beneath
in
heaven
name
he
mouthed
tell
me
what
sort
of
place
this
is
before
he
stopped
appalled
by
a
sudden
thought
perhaps
he
was
insane
this
seeming
tomb
really
some
hospital
ward
transformed
by
his
crazed
brain
a
wave
of
weakness
overcame
him
and
he
fell
back
careful
the
other
spoke
soothingly
you
must
give
the
plasma
time
to
act
or
you
may
harm
yourself
if
allan
shut
out
sight
with
his
eyelids
and
listened
only
to
the
resonance
of
anthony
voice
he
could
hold
his
slipping
grip
on
reason
he
felt
that
the
cloth
of
his
robe
was
metal
fine
spun
and
woven
that
was
strangely
reassuring
how
long
do
you
think
you
have
slept
how
long
dane
murmured
something
told
him
that
he
had
been
unconscious
for
a
long
time
a
week
anthony
sighed
no
longer
than
that
much
longer
there
was
reluctance
in
his
tone
you
have
lain
here
for
twenty
years
allan
eyes
flew
open
and
he
stared
up
into
the
speaker
face
twenty
years
somehow
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
disbelieve
this
astounding
statement
he
struggled
hard
to
realize
its
implication
two
decades
had
passed
since
last
he
remembered
he
had
been
a
youth
then
now
he
was
anthony
continued
that
may
be
a
shock
to
you
but
this
will
be
a
greater
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
we
seven
we
four
men
and
three
women
are
the
only
living
humans
left
on
earth
the
words
dripped
into
allan
consciousness
beyond
them
he
could
hear
movements
exclamations
but
they
meant
nothing
to
him
only
the
one
thought
tolled
within
him
we
seven
are
the
only
living
humans
left
on
earth
dimly
he
knew
that
anthony
was
talking
there
is
a
possibility
a
bare
possibility
that
somewhere
near
here
there
are
two
others
that
chance
is
faint
indeed
otherwise
humanity
is
dead
killed
by
its
own
hand
through
a
dizzy
vertigo
that
blurred
sight
and
sound
allan
heard
the
rounded
voice
go
on
and
on
telling
the
story
of
the
doom
that
own
folly
had
brought
and
intermingled
with
that
tale
of
a
world
gone
mad
there
came
back
to
the
listener
the
vision
of
the
day
of
horror
that
to
him
seemed
but
yesterday
he
remembered
the
sudden
ultimatum
of
the
easterner
the
western
coalition
stanch
defiance
again
he
saw
a
supposedly
invincible
fleet
utterly
destroyed
saw
comrades
whiffed
out
of
existence
in
infinitesimal
seconds
again
he
watched
a
city
of
twenty
millions
inundated
by
a
muddy
yellow
gas
in
which
no
human
being
no
animal
might
live
he
waked
once
more
to
find
himself
helpless
with
weakness
among
living
corpses
in
a
place
that
seemed
a
tomb
all
this
we
saw
in
our
televisoscope
anthony
gestured
to
a
blank
screen
above
the
apparatus
ranged
along
the
opposite
wall
then
just
as
that
last
weird
battle
ended
something
happened
to
the
outside
and
we
were
isolated
he
fell
silent
in
a
brooding
reverie
and
allan
recovered
somewhat
saw
that
the
other
strange
occupants
of
the
place
had
risen
and
were
clustered
about
that
cage
where
something
fluttered
he
turned
to
his
mentor
but
i
still
do
understand
how
is
it
that
we
escaped
the
holocaust
four
of
us
members
of
the
scientific
faculty
of
the
national
university
having
foreseen
the
inevitable
result
of
the
course
of
world
events
had
joined
forces
and
developed
a
substance
we
called
it
nullite
so
dense
and
so
inert
that
no
gas
could
penetrate
it
or
chemical
break
it
down
we
offered
it
to
the
western
general
staff
and
were
laughed
at
for
our
pains
then
we
decided
to
use
it
to
preserve
our
families
from
the
danger
we
foresaw
at
first
we
sheathed
one
room
in
each
of
our
own
dwellings
with
the
nullite
later
we
decided
that
the
deposited
gas
might
last
for
many
years
and
blasted
out
this
cave
a
hundred
feet
below
the
summit
of
sugar
loaf
mountain
for
a
common
refuge
when
the
red
word
flared
from
the
newscast
machines
we
fled
here
with
our
wives
as
we
had
planned
all
that
is
save
one
couple
the
youngest
of
us
they
never
arrived
i
waited
for
them
in
the
clearing
at
the
entrance
to
the
shaft
at
the
last
moment
i
saw
you
dropping
in
your
parachute
saw
the
death
beam
just
miss
you
saw
you
land
at
my
feet
unconscious
but
still
breathing
i
carried
you
in
with
me
there
were
two
vacant
spaces
you
could
occupy
one
of
them
then
we
sealed
the
last
aperture
with
nullite
and
settled
to
our
vigil
we
did
not
know
how
long
the
gas
would
last
but
we
had
sufficient
concentrated
food
and
enough
chemicals
to
last
two
persons
for
a
century
two
people
allan
interjected
but
there
were
seven
here
anthony
nodded
we
had
worked
out
every
detail
of
our
plan
when
release
came
we
needs
must
be
in
the
full
vigor
of
our
prime
from
our
loins
must
spring
the
new
race
that
will
repopulate
the
earth
that
will
found
a
new
civilization
better
we
hope
and
wiser
than
the
one
that
had
died
by
injecting
a
certain
compound
we
suspended
animation
in
all
but
a
single
couple
those
so
treated
were
to
all
intents
dead
though
their
bodies
did
not
decay
the
two
who
remained
awake
kept
watch
making
daily
tests
of
the
outside
atmosphere
drawn
through
tubes
of
nullite
that
pierced
the
seal
at
the
end
of
six
months
they
revived
another
couple
by
the
use
of
a
second
injection
and
were
themselves
put
to
sleep
we
exempted
you
from
the
watch
since
you
could
have
no
companion
so
that
while
we
have
lived
about
seven
years
in
the
twenty
you
have
not
aged
at
all
not
aged
at
all
dane
exclaimed
why
i
have
wasted
away
to
a
mere
bagful
of
bones
and
you
others
also
the
other
smiled
wistfully
even
though
life
was
the
merest
thread
there
was
still
an
infinitely
slow
using
of
bodily
tissue
but
the
drink
we
partook
of
as
we
awoke
is
a
plasma
that
will
very
quickly
restore
the
lost
body
elements
in
an
hour
we
shall
all
have
been
rejuvenated
you
will
be
again
the
age
you
were
on
that
fateful
day
in
and
the
rest
of
us
but
seven
years
older
look
he
moved
aside
so
that
allen
could
see
the
others
who
had
gathered
around
his
couch
they
were
a
curious
semicircle
of
gaunt
figures
but
he
could
see
that
they
had
subtly
changed
still
emaciated
beyond
description
they
were
no
longer
simulacra
of
death
the
contours
of
their
faces
were
rounding
were
filling
out
and
the
faintest
tinge
of
pink
was
creeping
into
the
yellow
of
their
skins
anthony
is
it
time
that
we
opened
the
seals
and
went
outside
have
we
been
long
enough
in
this
prison
it
was
a
short
man
who
spoke
his
voice
impatient
and
there
was
an
eager
murmur
from
the
others
i
am
as
anxious
as
you
anthony
slow
words
were
dubious
but
it
may
still
be
dangerous
the
gas
may
have
cleared
away
only
from
our
immediate
vicinity
in
hollows
or
places
where
the
air
is
stagnant
it
may
still
be
toxic
it
is
my
opinion
that
only
one
should
go
at
first
to
investigate
a
babble
of
volunteering
cries
burst
out
but
dane
voice
cut
through
the
others
look
here
the
sentence
tumbled
from
his
lips
i
an
extra
here
it
does
matter
whether
i
live
or
die
i
have
no
special
knowledge
i
can
not
even
father
a
family
since
i
have
no
wife
i
am
the
only
one
to
go
out
as
long
as
there
is
danger
the
young
man
is
right
some
one
said
he
is
the
logical
choice
very
well
agreed
anthony
who
appeared
the
leader
he
shall
be
the
first
his
instructions
were
few
one
plane
had
been
preserved
and
was
in
the
shaft
allan
was
to
make
a
circuit
of
the
neighborhood
if
he
deemed
it
safe
he
was
to
visit
the
building
described
to
him
where
the
fourth
couple
had
lived
and
see
if
he
could
find
trace
of
them
then
he
was
to
return
and
report
his
findings
all
stuffed
their
ears
with
cotton
wool
and
crowded
against
one
end
of
the
chamber
anthony
had
the
end
of
a
long
double
wire
in
his
hand
and
it
curled
across
the
floor
to
the
farther
wall
he
pressed
the
button
of
a
and
there
was
a
concussion
that
hurled
the
watchers
against
the
wall
behind
them
a
great
gap
appeared
in
the
farther
wall
beyond
it
a
black
chasm
and
a
helicopter
that
was
dimly
illumined
by
the
light
from
within
the
room
a
quick
inspection
of
the
flier
revealed
that
its
had
been
unaffected
by
the
passage
of
time
and
allan
climbed
into
it
a
wave
of
his
hand
simulated
an
insouciance
he
did
not
feel
then
he
was
rising
through
darkness
the
sun
light
struck
down
and
enveloped
him
and
he
was
in
the
open
air
he
rose
above
the
trees
desolation
spread
out
beneath
him
in
all
the
vastness
that
unfolded
as
the
lone
climbed
into
a
clear
sky
nothing
moved
the
air
that
from
babyhood
allan
had
seen
crowded
with
bustling
traffic
was
a
ghastly
emptiness
not
even
a
tiny
wheeling
speck
betrayed
the
presence
of
a
bird
and
below
the
gas
that
was
fatal
to
animal
life
seemed
to
have
stimulated
vegetable
growth
an
illimitable
sea
of
green
rolled
untenanted
to
where
the
first
ramparts
of
new
york
rose
against
the
sky
roads
monorail
lines
all
the
countless
tracks
of
civilization
had
disappeared
beneath
the
green
tide
nature
had
taken
back
its
own
heartsick
he
turned
south
and
followed
the
silver
stream
of
the
hudson
the
river
lonely
as
the
sky
seemed
to
drift
oily
and
sluggish
down
to
plunge
beneath
the
city
at
the
lower
end
of
the
tappan
zee
allan
dane
came
over
new
york
gazed
down
at
the
ruin
of
its
soaring
towers
at
the
leaping
arabesque
of
its
street
bridges
he
peered
into
vast
rifts
of
tumbled
chaotic
concrete
and
steel
nothing
moved
in
all
that
spreading
wonder
that
had
housed
twenty
millions
of
people
allan
drifted
lower
and
saw
that
from
what
had
been
gardened
now
a
welter
of
strewn
earth
the
green
things
had
spread
till
they
covered
the
heaped
jetsam
with
a
healing
blanket
of
foliage
not
all
the
city
had
been
laid
waste
however
here
and
there
great
expanses
of
the
structures
still
stood
undamaged
and
in
the
midst
of
one
of
these
areas
he
saw
the
edifice
to
which
he
had
been
directed
its
roof
was
lush
with
vegetation
but
by
dextrous
handling
he
set
his
helicopter
down
upon
it
the
engine
roar
diminished
and
died
silence
folded
around
him
a
black
thick
blanket
dane
got
heavily
from
his
seat
oppressed
by
the
vast
soundlessness
and
pushed
through
curling
plants
that
caught
at
his
heels
the
sound
of
his
passage
was
like
crackling
thunder
a
decaying
door
was
marked
in
faded
almost
undecipherable
letters
emergency
stairs
it
was
half
open
and
allan
squeezed
around
its
edge
spiral
steps
curved
down
into
blackness
he
hesitated
a
moment
he
could
the
awful
silence
the
emptiness
below
was
a
pit
of
death
anthony
words
came
back
to
him
echoed
in
his
ears
we
seven
are
the
only
living
humans
left
on
earth
in
that
moment
out
of
the
well
of
soundlessness
a
scream
shrilled
no
words
only
a
red
thin
thread
of
sound
rising
and
falling
and
rising
again
out
of
depths
where
not
even
a
living
mouse
should
be
it
came
again
ripping
the
silence
a
woman
scream
quivering
with
fear
allan
plunged
down
into
the
darkness
caroming
from
wall
to
wall
as
he
half
ran
half
fell
down
the
twisting
stairs
another
sound
reverberated
from
unseen
walls
and
dane
realized
that
it
was
his
own
voice
shouting
his
feet
struck
level
floor
a
pale
rectangle
of
light
showed
before
him
and
he
dived
through
it
he
was
in
a
corridor
by
phosphorescent
fungi
that
cloaked
the
damp
walls
he
halted
at
fault
the
long
hall
stretched
away
to
either
side
cluttered
with
grimed
bones
slimy
with
mold
by
the
name
cards
on
closed
doors
he
knew
himself
to
be
on
a
residential
level
but
which
way
should
he
turn
whence
had
come
that
scream
he
crouched
against
the
wall
his
heartbeats
thudding
loud
in
his
ears
and
listened
for
a
clue
a
muffled
sound
of
scuffling
came
from
his
left
allan
whirled
toward
it
and
sped
down
the
corridor
he
was
breathing
in
great
gasps
and
the
air
he
breathed
was
thick
and
musty
too
late
to
stop
he
saw
a
slick
of
green
slime
on
the
floor
his
foot
struck
it
flew
out
from
under
him
he
fell
and
slid
headlong
something
stopped
him
something
that
crunched
sickeningly
as
his
sliding
body
crashed
into
it
two
skeleton
forms
clasped
in
each
others
arms
moldering
fabric
hanging
in
rags
from
them
they
lay
across
the
threshold
of
a
door
and
just
within
dane
heard
snarls
snufflings
bestial
growls
the
sounds
of
a
struggle
something
thumped
against
the
door
and
fell
away
he
heaved
to
his
feet
and
his
hand
found
the
doorknob
but
suddenly
he
was
powerless
to
turn
it
panic
tugged
at
him
with
almost
palpable
fingers
drove
him
to
go
back
to
his
plane
and
safety
almost
he
fled
but
he
remembered
in
time
that
it
was
a
scream
he
had
heard
the
portal
gave
easily
to
his
lunge
bluish
light
flooded
the
chamber
dazzling
after
the
fungous
dimness
a
bulking
form
whether
ape
or
man
he
could
not
make
out
so
brutish
the
face
so
hairy
the
dark
body
revealed
by
its
tattered
rags
bent
over
the
sprawled
shape
of
a
girl
dane
saw
her
in
a
fleeting
glimpse
the
slim
length
of
her
the
tumbled
golden
hair
half
hiding
half
revealing
white
curves
of
beauty
a
shoulder
from
which
the
tunic
had
been
torn
away
then
her
attacker
whirled
toward
the
intruder
allan
leaped
from
the
threshold
his
fist
arcing
before
him
the
blow
landed
flush
on
the
other
jaw
yellow
rotted
fangs
showed
in
a
face
and
the
huge
negro
lunged
for
dane
roaring
his
rage
before
the
american
could
dodge
or
strike
again
the
other
long
arms
were
around
him
allan
was
jerked
against
a
barrel
chest
felt
his
bones
cracking
in
a
terrific
hug
eyes
tiny
and
red
stared
into
his
dane
drove
knees
and
fists
into
the
negro
but
the
awful
pressure
of
those
simian
arms
across
his
back
increased
till
he
could
no
longer
breathe
the
american
was
almost
gone
the
black
face
blurred
and
the
continuous
snarling
of
the
brute
was
dull
in
his
ears
suddenly
dane
went
limp
victory
flashed
into
the
red
eyes
the
squeezing
arms
relaxed
and
in
that
moment
allan
legs
curled
around
the
black
heels
jerking
into
the
hollows
behind
his
captor
knees
at
the
same
instant
levering
from
that
heel
hold
dane
butted
sharply
up
against
the
rocky
jaw
all
the
strength
that
was
left
in
him
went
into
that
trick
and
it
worked
the
negro
crashed
backward
to
the
floor
allan
twisted
and
rolled
free
he
was
up
looking
desperately
around
for
some
weapon
but
it
was
not
needed
the
hulk
on
the
floor
never
moved
the
back
of
the
negro
head
had
smashed
against
the
floor
and
he
was
out
dane
turned
and
bent
to
the
girl
she
too
was
motionless
but
to
his
relief
her
breast
rose
and
fell
steadily
he
glanced
about
looking
for
water
to
revive
her
then
he
saw
that
this
room
was
sheathed
with
nullite
then
this
was
one
of
the
chambers
prepared
before
the
plans
were
changed
but
the
girl
could
not
be
of
the
fourth
couple
the
missing
two
that
had
never
appeared
she
was
no
more
than
eighteen
and
whence
had
come
the
giant
black
who
had
attacked
her
stick
up
your
hands
quick
allan
whirled
to
the
sudden
challenge
the
man
in
the
doorway
was
pointing
a
steadily
at
him
dane
hands
went
up
and
he
gasped
inanely
who
are
you
what
is
going
on
here
where
did
you
come
from
the
english
was
precise
too
precise
no
hulking
brute
this
a
yellow
man
slitted
eyes
slanted
and
malevolent
broad
flat
nose
above
thin
lips
that
were
purple
against
the
saffron
skin
the
uniform
he
wore
showed
signs
of
some
attempt
to
keep
it
in
repair
and
to
its
threadbare
collar
still
clung
a
tarnished
insignia
the
star
emblem
of
the
enemy
allan
had
fought
on
a
yesterday
that
was
two
decades
gone
well
have
you
lost
the
power
of
speech
the
jerked
forward
impatiently
an
obscure
impulse
prompted
allan
reply
almost
i
spoken
to
no
one
for
twenty
years
softly
the
oriental
eyes
flicked
past
dane
and
a
sudden
light
glowed
in
them
you
have
been
alone
for
twenty
years
in
this
city
we
thought
was
empty
but
you
were
on
hand
to
fight
with
for
this
delightful
creature
something
leered
from
his
face
that
sent
the
hot
blood
surging
to
allan
temples
the
easterner
stepped
catlike
into
the
room
shutting
the
door
behind
him
with
his
free
hand
that
is
true
the
american
said
with
what
calmness
he
could
muster
through
the
dizzy
whirl
of
his
mind
he
clung
to
one
thought
he
must
conceal
the
existence
of
the
little
group
on
sugar
loaf
mountain
at
all
costs
i
had
just
discovered
that
it
was
safe
to
leave
the
room
similar
to
this
in
which
i
had
hidden
from
the
gas
when
i
heard
a
scream
i
reached
here
just
in
time
to
to
interfere
with
pleasure
and
save
the
little
white
dove
for
me
my
thanks
the
yellow
man
bowed
mockingly
too
bad
he
purred
that
you
should
be
robbed
of
the
spoils
of
your
fight
then
he
asked
irrelevantly
so
some
of
you
americans
found
a
way
to
cheat
our
gas
how
many
allan
temporized
there
had
been
several
similar
refuges
prepared
he
said
but
he
did
not
know
whether
they
had
been
used
this
was
the
first
he
had
visited
beside
his
own
but
how
was
it
that
the
questioner
knew
so
little
about
what
had
happened
here
had
his
people
simply
laid
this
country
waste
and
never
revisited
it
the
oriental
shrugged
my
people
are
gone
wiped
out
by
your
gas
as
yours
were
wiped
out
by
ours
he
retold
anthony
story
the
crew
of
my
own
ship
mutinied
he
concluded
we
fled
north
from
that
last
terrible
fight
north
ever
north
till
at
the
top
of
the
world
we
found
a
little
space
that
was
not
there
was
nothing
there
just
the
ice
and
the
snow
and
the
cold
we
lived
there
twelve
of
us
all
men
there
were
a
few
bears
and
seals
we
slew
them
for
food
and
we
grew
a
little
mad
we
were
men
all
men
do
you
understand
as
he
said
this
last
his
thin
voice
rose
to
a
shriek
and
his
eyes
darted
to
the
girl
recumbent
form
at
length
he
went
on
the
gas
began
to
retreat
and
they
followed
it
down
they
had
searched
town
after
town
city
after
city
had
found
food
in
plenty
and
all
the
trappings
of
civilization
but
there
was
never
a
living
being
and
the
fever
in
their
blood
drove
them
on
that
very
morning
the
insane
search
had
reached
new
york
they
had
landed
on
the
roof
of
this
very
building
we
separated
to
hunt
and
was
the
lucky
one
but
i
jung
sin
am
still
luckier
he
crept
nearer
to
allan
and
tapped
him
on
the
chest
with
his
weapon
for
look
you
while
those
fools
used
all
their
charges
even
the
charge
of
the
big
tube
on
our
ship
to
kill
food
i
husbanded
mine
he
laughed
shrilly
so
you
see
i
have
the
only
in
the
world
it
shall
make
me
master
of
the
earth
again
he
laughed
wildly
now
i
going
to
kill
you
the
black
cylinder
leveled
and
dane
stared
at
death
alone
he
would
almost
have
welcomed
it
but
the
thought
of
the
girl
in
the
filthy
power
of
this
beast
seared
through
him
jung
sin
the
little
red
worms
of
madness
crawling
in
his
brain
paused
for
a
final
taunt
let
the
thought
of
the
white
dove
in
my
arms
cons
allan
sandaled
foot
shot
out
into
the
man
stomach
in
the
same
movement
his
hands
came
down
one
snatched
at
and
caught
the
the
other
smashed
into
the
yellow
face
jung
sin
lifted
to
the
drive
of
fist
and
foot
crashed
into
the
wall
fell
to
its
foot
from
the
crumpled
heap
rose
a
shriek
a
long
piercing
wail
that
ended
in
a
gurgle
dane
froze
the
captured
cylinder
in
his
hand
and
listened
there
were
others
of
the
unholy
band
about
had
they
heard
dim
sounds
came
to
him
he
leaped
to
the
door
flung
it
open
faint
footfalls
a
distant
shout
came
from
far
down
the
corridor
away
from
the
direction
of
the
stairs
allan
glimpsed
dark
forms
rushing
toward
him
he
darted
back
to
the
girl
swung
her
still
unconscious
to
his
shoulder
and
was
out
the
floor
was
slippery
beneath
his
feet
he
reeled
as
he
ran
and
the
sounds
of
pursuit
gained
on
him
the
heavy
burden
weighed
him
down
the
dim
hallway
stretched
endlessly
before
him
from
close
behind
came
hoarse
guttural
shouts
that
chilled
him
the
pack
was
not
twenty
feet
away
when
allan
reached
the
stair
door
he
slammed
it
behind
him
heard
the
latch
click
he
mounted
the
narrow
winding
steps
with
the
last
dregs
of
energy
draining
from
him
and
heard
a
crash
below
that
told
of
the
collapse
of
the
barrier
but
he
had
reached
his
plane
had
flung
the
girl
into
it
and
was
pulling
himself
in
when
the
first
of
the
pursuers
burst
out
on
the
roof
allan
thrust
home
the
throttle
the
whined
and
his
leaped
skyward
he
glimpsed
men
running
across
the
roof
they
vanished
behind
a
leafy
arbor
dane
turned
the
nose
of
his
craft
toward
sugar
loaf
amethyst
in
the
haze
of
distance
but
from
that
green
arch
a
black
aircraft
zoomed
up
and
shot
after
him
the
american
shook
his
head
free
of
the
cobwebs
of
fatigue
and
veered
westward
he
must
not
lead
the
easterners
to
anthony
refuge
through
the
dead
air
over
a
dead
world
they
shot
allan
white
flier
and
the
ebony
plane
with
the
bloody
emblem
of
the
star
emblazoned
on
its
nose
allan
wheeled
again
as
the
pursuers
reached
his
level
on
a
long
climbing
slant
but
they
continued
rising
they
were
five
hundred
a
thousand
feet
above
him
then
they
leveled
out
and
dived
down
their
strategy
flashed
on
him
they
were
planning
to
shepherd
dane
down
to
force
him
to
land
where
they
would
have
him
at
their
mercy
and
their
craft
was
the
faster
the
black
ship
was
right
on
his
tail
allan
flicked
his
controls
and
his
slid
sidewise
on
one
wing
the
other
plane
banked
in
a
tight
arc
and
sped
for
him
dane
countered
with
a
lightning
loop
that
brought
him
behind
his
enemy
his
gray
eyes
were
his
lips
were
a
straight
thin
gash
the
other
ship
was
faster
but
his
lighter
and
smaller
was
more
flexible
he
could
not
get
away
but
they
flipped
up
and
back
in
an
inside
loop
allan
little
craft
from
under
this
sort
of
thing
could
not
last
forever
with
each
maneuver
he
was
losing
altitude
serrated
were
already
a
scant
fifteen
hundred
feet
beneath
him
gaunt
gray
fingers
that
reached
up
to
pluck
him
from
the
sky
only
half
allan
mind
was
concentrated
on
the
aerial
acrobatics
the
other
half
plodded
a
weary
treadmill
in
the
nullite
chamber
beneath
sugar
loaf
summit
he
thought
were
three
couples
whose
knowledge
and
wisdom
had
preserved
them
for
the
repeopling
of
the
earth
their
children
and
their
children
children
starting
from
such
a
source
what
heights
might
not
the
new
race
attain
on
the
other
hand
the
ship
that
pursued
him
carried
cowards
who
had
failed
in
mankind
supreme
test
men
who
had
lost
their
manhood
ravening
half
mad
with
loneliness
and
desire
as
long
as
they
remained
alive
they
would
be
a
menace
to
those
others
an
unclean
band
that
would
forever
sully
the
new
world
with
the
old
evils
even
should
allan
himself
escape
them
by
some
trick
of
fortune
they
must
inevitably
find
the
little
band
of
men
and
women
a
cold
chill
ran
through
dane
as
he
visioned
the
result
he
was
not
afraid
to
die
and
the
girl
in
the
cabin
behind
him
better
that
she
never
awake
than
that
she
be
the
sport
of
kind
a
grim
resolve
formed
itself
and
he
watched
for
a
chance
to
put
it
into
execution
it
came
at
the
end
of
a
shifting
maneuver
the
black
was
above
and
behind
the
white
dane
fingers
played
swiftly
over
the
control
board
his
ship
flipped
over
backward
rolling
on
its
long
axis
as
it
somersaulted
it
was
directly
beneath
the
other
then
the
screamed
and
the
american
plane
surged
straight
up
a
resounding
crash
split
the
air
metal
ripped
a
fuel
tank
exploded
a
black
wing
scaled
earthward
zigzagging
oddly
dane
craft
and
the
eastern
ship
clung
in
an
embrace
of
death
they
started
to
drop
but
queerly
the
black
plane
fell
faster
left
the
white
one
behind
as
its
descent
gained
speed
till
it
splashed
against
concrete
below
the
american
helicopter
was
dropping
too
but
sluggishly
something
was
buoying
it
up
allan
momentarily
struggling
out
of
the
welter
of
blackness
and
pain
into
which
the
concussion
had
thrown
him
heard
a
familiar
whine
his
were
still
twirling
limply
stutteringly
bent
and
twisted
but
gripping
the
air
sufficiently
to
brake
his
crushed
plane
fall
afterwards
allan
figured
it
out
the
black
pilot
had
slipped
sidewise
in
that
last
frantic
moment
his
effort
to
escape
had
been
futile
but
instead
of
his
ship
body
dane
plane
had
struck
the
wing
and
torn
it
off
the
impact
had
irreparably
damaged
the
american
craft
but
the
helicopter
motor
and
vanes
had
somehow
continued
to
function
just
enough
the
stanch
fuselage
though
bent
and
disfigured
had
fended
the
full
force
of
the
crash
from
allan
and
his
passenger
just
now
however
allan
dane
was
doing
no
figuring
pain
welled
behind
his
eyes
his
left
arm
was
limp
and
a
broken
stanchion
jammed
his
feet
so
they
could
move
the
vane
motor
stuttered
and
stopped
the
plane
floor
dropped
away
from
beneath
him
then
thudded
against
something
the
jar
jolted
allan
into
a
gray
land
where
there
was
nothing
someone
was
talking
he
could
make
out
the
words
but
the
sound
was
pleasant
it
soothed
the
throb
throb
in
his
head
gosh
that
had
been
some
party
last
night
celebrating
flight
zlx
first
prize
in
maneuvers
great
bunch
but
would
they
be
as
good
in
real
war
sure
to
come
soon
dane
stuff
had
too
much
kick
he
must
have
passed
out
early
somebody
shaking
him
lea
me
wan
na
sleep
oh
wake
up
please
wake
up
girl
voice
nice
voice
voice
like
that
should
have
pretty
face
better
not
look
though
too
bad
if
she
had
buck
teeth
or
squint
eyes
oh
what
will
i
do
you
not
dead
please
you
not
dead
do
think
so
head
hurts
too
much
allan
opened
his
eyes
wrong
again
mus
be
dead
only
angel
could
look
like
that
not
in
right
place
though
mistake
in
shipping
directions
tags
switched
or
something
a
cold
hand
lay
across
his
brow
and
he
felt
it
quiver
do
talk
like
that
wake
up
there
was
hysteria
in
the
limpid
tones
allan
brain
mists
cleared
and
he
grinned
wryly
i
remember
now
you
all
right
yes
but
who
are
you
are
you
anthony
starr
no
but
anthony
sent
me
allan
struggled
to
rise
he
saw
twisted
wreckage
beside
him
he
gasped
i
seem
to
be
a
bit
conked
but
what
what
do
you
know
about
anthony
the
girl
fumbled
in
her
garments
brought
out
a
paper
allan
found
that
he
could
move
his
right
arm
without
much
pain
he
took
the
yellowed
sheet
and
read
the
faded
writing
dear
naomi
you
are
asleep
and
we
have
been
standing
by
your
couch
drinking
in
the
dear
sight
of
you
you
sleep
soundly
tired
as
you
are
by
the
story
we
told
you
on
this
your
sixteenth
birthday
the
tale
of
how
the
world
you
know
only
from
our
teachings
was
destroyed
of
how
we
planned
with
our
friends
to
escape
the
general
fate
of
how
an
accident
separated
us
from
them
and
immured
us
here
alone
of
how
you
were
born
in
this
room
and
why
you
have
lived
here
all
your
short
life
we
told
you
all
that
but
there
is
one
thing
we
did
not
tell
you
our
food
supply
has
run
low
and
the
gas
outside
shows
no
signs
of
abatement
with
careful
husbanding
we
could
all
three
live
for
another
four
months
but
there
is
no
prospect
that
we
shall
be
released
in
so
short
a
time
alone
you
will
have
sufficient
for
a
year
if
we
had
had
some
of
carl
thorman
serum
but
it
was
his
perfection
of
that
which
caused
the
change
of
plan
to
a
common
refuge
and
we
never
thought
to
stock
with
it
the
discarded
rooms
in
our
own
apartments
we
have
talked
it
over
and
have
decided
that
you
must
have
that
eight
months
extra
chance
and
so
dear
daughter
this
must
be
farewell
when
the
gas
is
gone
anthony
will
come
to
seek
us
if
he
still
lives
you
will
know
him
by
the
white
robe
of
metal
fabric
he
will
wear
with
its
black
girdle
trust
yourself
to
him
he
was
our
friend
if
all
the
food
has
been
consumed
and
he
still
has
not
come
open
the
door
but
fate
will
not
be
so
cruel
to
you
we
are
weary
of
the
long
waiting
naomi
do
not
grieve
for
us
we
shall
go
out
into
the
gas
hand
in
hand
and
release
will
be
welcome
god
guard
you
allan
was
deeply
moved
by
the
love
and
sacrifice
so
simply
worded
he
looked
at
the
girl
and
had
to
blink
away
a
mist
that
hazed
his
sight
before
he
could
see
her
i
see
he
said
when
the
year
ended
and
anthony
had
not
come
you
opened
the
door
and
the
gas
was
gone
then
i
heard
someone
moving
far
down
the
corridor
i
was
so
happy
who
could
it
be
but
anthony
i
called
a
hairy
black
giant
came
running
bellowing
in
some
strange
language
i
was
terribly
frightened
i
think
i
screamed
and
tried
to
shut
the
door
but
he
was
too
quick
for
me
he
was
in
the
room
and
his
filthy
paws
reached
out
for
me
i
screamed
again
dodged
away
from
him
he
pursued
me
i
threw
myself
backward
tripped
and
fell
my
head
crashed
against
the
floor
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
here
and
you
were
twisted
and
jammed
there
in
front
of
me
at
first
i
wanted
to
run
then
i
saw
your
robe
i
dragged
you
out
then
i
spied
that
other
pile
of
wreckage
and
i
thought
you
too
were
dead
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
allan
turned
his
head
saw
for
the
first
time
the
crumpled
debris
of
the
black
ship
a
hundred
feet
away
saw
stark
forms
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
now
he
said
it
all
over
we
soon
be
with
your
father
friend
with
anthony
a
little
smile
of
reassurance
trembled
on
the
girls
lips
oh
do
you
think
so
allan
nodded
sure
thing
just
trust
to
me
miss
call
me
naomi
i
allan
the
pilot
thrust
out
his
big
hand
full
fleshed
now
and
a
little
white
one
fluttered
into
it
an
electric
thrill
rippled
at
the
contact
and
the
two
hands
clung
the
girl
gave
a
little
gasp
and
pink
flushed
her
cheeks
naomi
shivered
a
little
and
allan
realized
that
a
chill
breeze
was
sweeping
across
the
and
that
daylight
was
almost
gone
look
here
partner
we
better
get
started
somewhere
he
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
pain
shot
through
him
and
his
head
still
throbbed
better
take
a
look
at
that
he
gestured
to
the
wreck
of
the
eastern
ship
you
wait
here
when
he
returned
his
face
was
pallid
and
there
was
a
sick
look
in
his
eyes
the
girl
asked
sharply
what
is
it
what
wrong
tell
me
allan
he
looked
at
her
grimly
started
to
say
something
thought
better
of
it
then
it
was
a
pleasant
sight
he
shrugged
come
on
see
what
we
can
find
we
have
to
spend
the
night
here
and
start
for
sugar
loaf
mountain
in
the
morning
once
more
allan
descended
a
narrow
spiral
staircase
into
darkness
and
silence
but
this
time
someone
was
at
his
side
and
a
warmness
ran
through
him
at
the
thought
the
topmost
floor
of
this
building
was
a
residential
level
like
the
one
where
he
had
found
naomi
a
green
mold
covered
everything
and
pallid
fungi
emitting
a
phosphorescence
clung
to
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
the
long
corridor
apparently
the
dwellers
here
had
rushed
out
at
the
first
alarm
had
died
elsewhere
this
is
luck
allan
said
we
shall
have
a
comfortable
place
to
sleep
and
food
is
not
far
away
how
is
that
why
the
stores
level
is
not
far
below
most
of
new
york
structures
have
a
number
of
residential
levels
at
the
top
then
a
floor
of
retail
stores
and
below
that
amusement
places
offices
and
factories
but
whatever
food
there
was
must
be
decayed
by
this
time
the
fresh
food
yes
but
there
was
a
lot
of
canned
stuff
and
that
is
probably
all
right
he
pushed
open
a
door
in
the
eery
light
a
living
room
was
revealed
you
wait
here
and
i
see
what
i
can
rustle
up
but
i
want
to
go
with
you
allan
was
inflexible
please
do
as
i
say
i
have
my
reasons
the
girl
turned
away
oh
very
well
she
said
flatly
if
you
want
me
with
you
that
a
good
scout
i
be
back
just
as
quickly
as
i
can
and
by
the
way
lock
the
door
from
the
inside
and
do
open
it
till
you
hear
my
voice
the
girl
looked
at
him
wonderingly
but
she
began
do
ask
me
why
do
it
there
was
a
curious
note
in
allan
voice
one
that
cut
off
naomi
question
the
door
shut
and
dane
heard
the
bolt
shoot
home
he
stood
in
the
corridor
listening
intently
his
face
strained
there
was
no
sound
save
that
of
naomi
movements
behind
the
locked
door
allan
turned
to
search
for
the
auxiliary
staircase
that
must
be
somewhere
near
the
bank
of
ascendor
doors
silence
was
again
around
him
almost
tangible
in
its
heaviness
his
footsteps
reverberated
through
dead
halls
the
echo
curiously
muffled
by
the
coating
of
slime
that
spread
dankly
green
allan
found
the
staircase
well
descended
cautiously
pausing
often
to
listen
not
even
the
faint
scuttering
of
vermin
rewarded
him
at
last
three
stories
down
he
reached
the
stores
level
here
in
a
great
open
hall
were
the
numerous
alcoved
recesses
of
the
shops
once
thronged
and
gaudy
with
the
varicolored
goods
brought
by
plane
and
from
both
hemispheres
the
vast
space
was
a
desert
of
moldering
dust
heaps
brooding
there
was
a
faint
odor
in
the
stagnant
air
of
spices
and
rustling
silks
of
rare
perfumes
of
all
the
luxury
of
the
golden
age
that
man
folly
had
ended
allan
searched
the
long
shelves
feverishly
a
nervous
urge
to
complete
his
task
and
get
back
to
naomi
tingling
in
his
veins
once
he
stopped
suddenly
his
body
twisting
to
the
stair
landing
he
seemed
to
have
heard
something
an
indefinable
thudding
the
shadow
of
a
sound
but
it
did
not
come
again
and
he
dismissed
it
as
the
thumping
of
his
own
blood
in
his
ears
audible
in
that
stillness
at
the
end
of
a
long
aisle
neat
rows
of
cans
greeted
him
the
labels
rotted
off
the
metal
but
apparently
tight
and
whole
he
found
a
metal
basket
a
roll
of
wire
twisted
a
handle
for
the
basket
and
filled
it
choosing
the
cans
by
their
shape
he
should
have
liked
to
explore
further
but
the
urge
to
return
tugged
at
him
he
went
up
the
stairs
three
at
a
time
there
was
a
dark
oblong
break
in
the
long
glowing
wall
of
the
upper
corridor
the
door
it
was
the
door
of
the
apartment
where
he
had
left
naomi
he
leaped
down
the
hall
shouting
the
portal
hung
open
shattered
the
rooms
were
stark
staring
empty
allan
reeled
out
again
there
were
the
marks
of
footprints
of
many
footprints
in
the
green
scum
of
the
hall
floor
their
own
among
them
that
had
led
the
marauders
straight
to
the
girl
fool
that
he
had
been
he
had
thought
she
would
be
safer
behind
a
bolted
door
allan
berated
himself
he
had
thought
not
to
worry
her
there
had
been
only
four
bodies
in
the
wreckage
of
the
black
plane
but
how
had
the
rest
gotten
here
so
soon
there
was
a
humming
whine
from
above
dane
hurtled
toward
the
roof
stairs
he
burst
from
the
upper
landing
fists
clenched
face
a
furious
mask
a
helicopter
was
just
rising
allan
jumped
for
it
his
fingers
caught
and
clung
to
the
undercarriage
but
the
of
his
body
broke
his
hold
and
dane
crashed
to
the
roof
he
watched
the
plane
saw
it
zoom
up
turn
east
saw
it
sink
and
land
a
half
mile
away
atop
the
building
where
he
had
found
her
in
the
moonlight
he
marked
the
direction
of
the
place
its
distance
then
he
was
descending
stairs
innumerable
stairs
he
could
not
hope
to
reach
it
in
time
to
save
naomi
but
his
eyes
grew
stony
he
could
avenge
her
afterwards
that
nightmare
journey
through
the
murdered
city
was
a
detailless
blur
to
allan
he
clambered
over
heaped
rubble
forced
himself
through
windrows
of
piled
bones
that
crumbled
to
dust
at
his
touch
vines
and
whipping
creepers
of
triumphant
vegetation
everywhere
halted
him
he
tore
them
away
with
bleeding
hands
and
stumbled
on
he
fell
and
scrambled
up
again
and
plodded
on
the
interminable
path
till
he
had
reached
his
goal
here
at
last
some
modicum
of
reason
penetrated
into
the
numbed
blankness
of
his
brain
the
dark
arch
of
the
was
somehow
familiar
still
legible
under
the
verdigris
of
the
bronze
plate
on
the
lintel
he
read
transportation
substation
district
now
he
understood
why
he
had
not
seen
the
black
flier
till
it
had
leaped
in
pursuit
how
it
was
that
naomi
captors
had
so
quickly
found
another
a
broad
well
penetrated
the
center
of
this
building
its
opening
must
be
covered
by
the
luxuriant
vines
so
that
he
had
not
noted
it
and
dropped
down
to
the
midsection
that
was
a
hangar
for
local
and
private
planes
his
own
little
zenith
had
been
stored
here
on
occasion
there
must
be
other
helicopters
there
and
a
stock
of
fuel
a
dim
plan
began
to
form
at
the
back
of
his
head
but
first
he
must
find
where
they
were
and
what
had
happened
to
naomi
allan
removed
his
sandals
and
began
the
endless
climb
he
made
no
sound
on
the
steps
cushioned
as
they
were
with
mold
but
at
each
landing
he
paused
for
a
moment
listening
the
cold
fire
that
burned
within
him
left
no
room
for
fatigue
for
pain
a
murmuring
then
a
laugh
cut
through
the
deathlike
stillness
allan
was
nearly
to
the
top
down
the
corridor
into
which
he
crept
snakelike
on
his
belly
red
light
flickered
from
an
open
door
dane
moved
soundlessly
to
that
door
and
lying
flat
pushed
his
head
slowly
past
the
sash
till
he
could
see
within
by
the
light
of
a
fire
that
danced
in
the
center
of
the
unburnable
mallite
floor
its
illumination
half
revealing
their
sodden
brutish
faces
he
saw
an
unspeakably
strange
group
a
scene
from
out
of
the
dawn
of
history
it
was
the
circle
their
yellow
skins
and
black
glistening
in
the
crimson
shifting
glow
he
recognized
the
giant
negro
his
head
bound
with
a
rag
and
jung
sin
there
were
five
others
clustered
about
those
two
and
a
third
a
oriental
intent
on
some
game
they
were
playing
with
little
sticks
that
passed
from
hand
to
hand
before
each
of
the
players
there
was
a
little
pile
of
fish
bones
black
with
much
handling
the
negro
pile
and
that
of
jung
sin
were
about
equal
but
there
were
only
two
or
three
in
front
of
the
third
player
and
just
as
allan
caught
sight
of
them
the
sticks
clicked
and
a
shrill
objurgation
burst
from
that
third
as
the
last
of
his
markers
were
raked
in
by
jung
sin
taloned
hand
the
circle
hunched
closer
there
was
a
ribald
taunting
laugh
from
and
jung
sin
glanced
over
his
shoulder
into
a
shadowed
corner
have
patience
my
lotus
flower
he
purred
only
one
is
left
soon
the
goddess
of
fortune
and
love
will
clear
him
from
my
path
by
the
dragon
i
have
never
seen
a
game
of
last
so
long
but
it
draws
to
an
end
then
we
shall
have
our
joy
together
you
and
i
in
that
instant
the
fire
flared
allan
saw
an
open
window
in
the
background
and
beneath
it
a
slim
white
form
lying
bound
and
helpless
fierce
joy
leaped
in
him
and
fiercer
hate
naomi
was
as
yet
untouched
the
game
was
being
played
for
her
as
stake
he
had
come
in
time
to
save
her
but
how
there
were
eight
of
the
easterners
in
the
room
he
had
his
and
might
cow
them
with
it
and
free
the
girl
but
as
soon
as
he
had
gotten
her
out
of
the
room
they
would
surge
out
after
the
whites
he
could
fight
for
a
while
but
the
end
was
inevitable
and
even
if
by
some
miracle
he
and
naomi
escaped
they
would
be
tracked
to
sugar
loaf
the
sticks
were
clicking
in
a
continuous
rattle
as
the
final
bout
of
the
game
waxed
fast
and
furious
and
as
fast
and
furious
was
the
whirl
of
allan
thoughts
he
strove
to
remember
the
layout
of
this
building
the
helicopter
hangar
was
next
above
this
level
outside
the
windows
of
this
floor
a
narrow
ledge
ran
the
nebulous
scheme
that
had
entered
his
dazed
brain
as
he
read
the
bronze
plate
below
took
clearer
form
shaped
itself
to
meet
this
new
need
allan
crept
away
to
safe
distance
leaped
to
his
feet
and
flitted
upward
he
was
in
the
empty
echoing
space
of
the
hangar
level
the
fuel
tanks
bulged
huge
in
the
dimness
here
were
reels
of
the
feed
hose
he
needed
flexible
metal
that
had
withstood
the
years
here
a
faucet
nozzle
and
a
long
coil
of
fine
wire
haste
driving
him
he
made
the
connections
then
he
was
descending
again
dragging
behind
him
a
long
black
snake
of
hose
whose
other
end
was
clamped
to
a
vat
of
oxygen
impregnated
gasoline
the
rustle
of
the
hose
along
the
hall
floor
was
muffled
by
the
greasy
slime
dane
got
the
nozzle
to
just
outside
the
door
of
the
room
where
naomi
lay
captive
the
rattle
of
the
playing
sticks
still
continued
jung
sin
voice
sounded
in
a
language
that
allan
did
not
understand
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
triumphant
note
in
the
silky
jeering
tones
the
yellow
man
was
winning
and
winning
fast
dane
twisted
one
end
of
the
wire
around
the
faucet
handle
then
he
was
unwinding
the
coil
as
he
tried
the
door
of
the
chamber
next
to
the
one
where
the
fire
burned
found
it
open
darted
across
the
room
and
softly
raised
the
sash
the
sill
here
like
the
one
beneath
which
naomi
lay
was
a
bare
two
feet
above
the
ground
he
was
out
on
the
ledge
sliding
along
it
toward
the
oblong
five
feet
away
he
crammed
his
body
close
against
the
wall
kept
his
eyes
away
from
the
unfenced
edge
of
that
shelf
beyond
an
abyss
waited
twelve
thousand
feet
of
nothingness
down
which
a
single
misstep
an
instant
vertigo
would
send
him
hurtling
suddenly
the
rattle
of
sticks
stopped
and
he
heard
the
black
long
howl
of
disappointed
rage
the
game
was
over
allan
reached
the
window
glimpsed
a
leering
semicircle
of
animal
faces
saw
jung
sin
coming
toward
him
then
he
had
swung
in
back
jung
sin
back
allan
was
straddled
over
naomi
form
the
thrust
out
before
his
tense
threat
his
face
livid
his
eyes
blazing
get
back
or
i
ray
you
consternation
awe
flashed
into
the
brutal
faces
of
the
easterners
jung
sin
reeled
back
his
saffron
hands
rising
allan
weapon
swept
slowly
along
the
line
of
staring
men
if
one
of
you
moves
i
flash
he
bent
to
the
girl
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
easterners
and
his
weapon
steady
he
had
hung
the
wire
coil
over
his
shoulder
leaving
his
left
hand
free
to
fumble
for
and
untie
the
cords
around
wrists
he
got
them
loose
can
you
get
your
feet
free
naomi
yes
i
can
manage
it
her
voice
was
steady
but
there
was
a
great
thankfulness
vibrant
in
it
then
do
it
and
get
out
on
the
ledge
quick
he
straightened
and
the
blaze
of
his
eyes
held
the
yellow
men
and
the
black
motionless
naomi
at
the
window
behind
him
gasped
i
know
it
looks
tough
he
encouraged
her
but
you
can
make
it
do
look
down
go
to
the
left
keep
clear
of
that
i
all
right
allan
but
you
never
mind
about
me
go
ahead
jung
sin
jerked
forward
driven
by
the
madness
that
twisted
his
face
into
gargoyle
hideousness
but
allan
stabbed
at
him
and
he
halted
i
out
allan
dane
foot
felt
back
of
him
for
the
sill
found
it
he
lifted
facing
his
enemies
inexorably
caught
the
lintel
with
his
left
hand
and
was
crouching
outside
a
sidewise
flick
of
his
eyes
showed
naomi
just
reaching
the
other
window
he
pulled
at
the
wire
till
it
was
gently
taut
a
moment
compunction
rose
in
him
at
what
he
was
about
to
do
then
the
black
roll
of
the
easterners
crimes
rushed
into
his
mind
naomi
safety
his
own
and
that
of
the
little
colony
that
had
endured
so
much
to
preserve
humanity
cried
out
for
their
extinction
allan
jerked
the
metal
thread
and
the
faucet
nozzle
in
the
corridor
opened
a
black
stream
gushed
forward
reached
the
fire
and
the
room
was
a
roaring
furnace
allan
saw
the
forms
of
his
enemies
silhouetted
against
the
blaze
for
a
fleeting
instant
then
they
were
flaming
statues
one
only
jung
sin
nearer
than
the
rest
leaped
for
the
window
and
escaped
the
first
gush
of
flame
allan
pressed
the
trigger
of
his
but
no
blue
flash
answered
that
pressure
the
charge
had
leaked
out
was
gone
allan
tore
himself
loose
from
yellow
hands
that
clutched
at
him
his
fist
crashed
into
jung
sin
fear
twisted
visage
and
the
crazed
oriental
fell
back
into
the
roaring
blaze
but
allan
himself
was
thrust
backward
by
that
blow
was
swaying
on
the
very
edge
of
the
chasm
his
hand
went
out
for
a
saving
hold
on
the
window
sash
flame
licked
at
it
he
was
toppling
against
the
strain
of
his
body
muscles
to
resist
the
inevitable
fall
and
death
reached
up
from
depths
for
him
then
an
arm
was
around
him
was
drawing
him
back
to
life
naomi
had
darted
back
defying
the
terror
of
that
height
the
surge
of
heat
she
had
reached
him
just
in
time
a
later
and
his
weight
would
have
been
too
much
for
her
puny
strength
but
in
this
instant
the
merest
touch
was
enough
to
save
him
they
crept
along
the
ledge
and
climbed
wearily
in
there
was
another
plane
in
the
hangar
and
presently
allan
had
it
rising
through
the
well
into
clean
free
air
he
turned
to
the
girl
in
the
seat
beside
him
and
pointed
at
the
scene
they
were
leaving
look
he
said
the
city
was
in
darkness
beneath
them
save
for
the
one
staring
rectangle
that
marked
a
pyre
but
dawn
shimmered
opalescent
in
the
east
a
soft
white
hand
crept
into
allan
there
was
a
long
moment
of
silence
then
allan
said
softly
a
new
day
and
a
new
world
for
their
children
a
sleepy
tired
voice
sighed
for
their
children
and
ours
allan
