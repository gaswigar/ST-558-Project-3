preface
to
those
of
my
own
generation
the
light
that
has
but
lately
failed
was
the
purest
that
illumined
their
youth
in
the
gloomy
twilight
of
the
later
nineteenth
century
it
shone
as
a
star
of
consolation
whose
radiance
attracted
and
appeased
our
awakening
spirits
as
one
of
the
many
for
there
are
many
in
france
to
whom
tolstoy
was
very
much
more
than
an
admired
artist
for
whom
he
was
a
friend
the
best
of
friends
the
one
true
friend
in
the
whole
of
european
art
i
wish
to
lay
before
this
sacred
memory
my
tribute
of
gratitude
and
of
love
the
days
when
i
learned
to
know
him
are
days
that
i
shall
never
forget
it
was
in
after
some
years
of
silent
germination
the
marvellous
flowers
of
russian
art
began
to
blossom
on
the
soil
of
france
translations
of
tolstoy
and
of
dostoyevsky
were
being
issued
in
feverish
haste
by
all
the
publishing
houses
of
paris
between
the
years
and
came
and
karenin
childhood
and
youth
polikushka
the
death
of
ivan
ilyitch
the
novels
of
the
caucasus
and
the
for
the
in
the
space
of
a
few
months
almost
of
a
few
weeks
there
was
revealed
to
our
eager
eyes
the
presentment
of
a
vast
unfamiliar
life
in
which
was
reflected
a
new
people
a
new
world
i
had
but
newly
entered
the
normal
college
my
were
of
widely
divergent
opinions
in
our
little
world
were
such
realistic
and
ironical
spirits
as
the
philosopher
georges
dumas
poets
like
suarès
burning
with
love
of
the
italian
renaissance
faithful
disciples
of
classic
tradition
stendhalians
wagnerians
atheists
and
mystics
it
was
a
world
of
plentiful
discussion
plentiful
disagreement
but
for
a
period
of
some
months
we
were
nearly
all
united
by
a
common
love
of
tolstoy
it
is
true
that
each
loved
him
for
different
reasons
for
each
discovered
in
him
himself
but
this
love
was
a
love
that
opened
the
door
to
a
revelation
of
life
to
the
wide
world
itself
on
every
side
in
our
families
in
our
country
homes
this
mighty
voice
which
spoke
from
the
confines
of
europe
awakened
the
same
emotions
unexpected
as
they
often
were
i
remember
my
amazement
upon
hearing
some
people
of
nivernais
my
native
province
people
who
felt
no
interest
whatever
in
art
people
who
read
practically
nothing
speak
with
the
most
intense
feeling
of
death
of
ivan
i
have
read
in
the
writings
of
distinguished
critics
the
theory
that
tolstoy
owed
the
best
of
his
ideas
to
the
french
romantics
to
george
sand
to
victor
hugo
we
may
ignore
the
absurdity
of
supposing
that
tolstoy
who
could
not
endure
her
could
ever
have
been
subject
to
the
influence
of
george
sand
but
we
can
not
deny
the
influence
of
rousseau
and
of
stendhal
nevertheless
we
belittle
the
greatness
of
tolstoy
and
the
power
of
his
fascination
if
we
attribute
them
to
his
ideas
the
circle
of
ideas
in
which
art
moves
and
has
its
being
is
a
narrow
one
it
is
not
in
those
ideas
that
his
might
resides
but
in
his
expression
of
them
in
the
personal
accent
the
imprint
of
the
artist
the
colour
and
savour
of
his
life
whether
tolstoy
ideas
were
or
were
not
borrowed
a
matter
to
be
presently
considered
never
yet
had
a
voice
like
to
his
resounded
throughout
europe
how
else
can
we
explain
the
thrill
of
emotion
which
we
all
of
us
felt
upon
hearing
that
psychic
music
that
harmony
for
which
we
had
so
long
waited
and
of
which
we
felt
the
need
in
our
opinion
the
style
counted
for
nothing
most
of
us
myself
included
made
the
acquaintance
of
melchior
de
vogüé
work
on
the
subject
of
the
russian
novel
after
we
had
read
the
novels
of
tolstoy
and
his
admiration
of
our
hero
seemed
after
ours
a
pallid
thing
de
vogüé
spoke
essentially
as
a
man
of
letters
pure
and
simple
but
for
our
part
it
was
not
enough
to
admire
the
presentation
of
life
we
lived
it
it
was
our
own
ours
it
was
by
its
ardent
love
of
life
by
its
quality
of
youth
ours
by
its
irony
its
disillusion
its
pitiless
discernment
and
its
haunting
sense
of
mortality
ours
by
its
dreams
of
brotherly
love
of
peace
among
men
ours
by
its
terrible
accusation
of
the
lies
of
civilisation
ours
by
its
realism
by
its
mysticism
ours
by
its
savour
of
nature
its
sense
of
invisible
forces
its
vertigo
in
the
face
of
the
infinite
to
many
of
us
the
novels
of
tolstoy
were
what
was
to
an
earlier
generation
the
wonderful
mirror
of
our
passions
our
strength
our
weaknesses
of
our
hopes
our
terrors
our
discouragement
we
were
in
no
wise
anxious
to
reconcile
these
many
contradictions
still
less
did
we
concern
ourselves
to
imprison
this
complex
multiple
mind
full
of
echoes
of
the
whole
wide
world
within
the
narrow
limits
of
religious
or
political
categories
as
have
the
greater
number
of
those
who
have
written
of
tolstoy
in
these
latter
years
incapable
of
extricating
themselves
from
the
conflict
of
parties
dragging
him
into
the
arena
of
their
own
passions
measuring
him
by
the
standards
of
their
socialistic
or
clerical
coteries
as
if
our
coteries
could
be
the
measure
of
a
genius
what
is
it
to
me
if
tolstoy
is
or
is
not
of
my
party
shall
i
ask
of
what
party
shakespeare
was
or
dante
before
i
breathe
the
atmosphere
of
his
magic
or
steep
myself
in
its
light
we
did
not
say
as
do
the
critics
of
that
there
were
two
tolstoys
the
tolstoy
of
the
period
before
the
crisis
and
he
of
the
period
after
the
crisis
that
the
one
was
the
great
artist
while
the
other
was
not
an
artist
at
all
for
us
there
was
only
one
tolstoy
and
we
loved
the
whole
of
him
for
we
felt
instinctively
that
in
such
souls
as
his
all
things
are
bound
together
and
each
has
its
integral
place

chapter
i
childhood
our
instinct
was
conscious
then
of
that
which
reason
must
prove
the
task
is
possible
now
for
the
long
life
has
attained
its
term
revealing
itself
unveiled
to
the
eyes
of
all
with
unequalled
candour
unexampled
sincerity
we
are
at
once
arrested
by
the
degree
in
which
that
life
has
always
remained
the
same
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
in
spite
of
all
the
barriers
which
critics
have
sought
to
erect
here
and
there
along
its
course
in
spite
of
tolstoy
himself
who
like
every
impassioned
mind
was
inclined
to
the
belief
when
he
loved
or
conceived
a
faith
that
he
loved
or
believed
for
the
first
time
that
the
commencement
of
his
true
life
dated
from
that
moment
commencement
recommencement
how
often
his
mind
was
the
theatre
of
the
same
struggles
the
same
crises
i
we
can
not
speak
of
the
unity
of
his
ideas
for
no
such
unity
existed
we
can
only
speak
of
the
persistence
among
them
of
the
same
diverse
elements
sometimes
allied
sometimes
inimical
more
often
enemies
than
allies
unity
is
to
be
found
neither
in
the
spirit
nor
the
mind
of
a
tolstoy
it
exists
only
in
the
internal
conflict
of
his
passions
in
the
tragedy
of
his
art
and
his
life
in
him
life
and
art
are
one
never
was
work
more
intimately
mingled
with
the
artist
life
it
has
almost
constantly
the
value
of
autobiography
it
enables
us
to
follow
the
writer
step
by
step
from
the
time
when
he
was
years
of
age
throughout
all
the
contradictory
experiences
of
his
adventurous
career
his
which
he
commenced
before
the
completion
of
his
twentieth
year
and
continued
until
his
death
together
with
the
notes
furnished
by
birukov
completes
this
knowledge
and
enable
us
not
only
to
read
almost
day
by
day
in
the
history
of
tolstoy
conscience
but
also
to
reconstitute
the
world
in
which
his
genius
struck
root
and
the
minds
from
which
his
own
drew
sustenance
his
was
a
rich
inheritance
the
tolstoys
and
the
volkonskys
were
very
ancient
families
of
the
greater
nobility
claiming
descent
from
rurik
numbering
among
their
ancestors
companions
of
peter
the
great
generals
of
the
seven
years
war
heroes
of
the
napoleonic
struggle
decembrists
and
political
exiles
this
inheritance
included
family
traditions
old
memories
to
which
tolstoy
was
indebted
for
some
of
the
most
original
types
in
his
and
peace
there
was
the
old
prince
bolkonsky
his
maternal
grandfather
voltairian
despotic
a
belated
representative
of
the
aristocracy
of
the
days
of
catherine
ii
prince
nikolas
grigorovitch
volkonsky
a
cousin
of
his
mother
who
was
wounded
at
austerlitz
and
like
prince
andrei
was
carried
off
the
field
of
battle
under
the
eyes
of
napoleon
his
father
who
had
some
of
the
characteristics
of
nicolas
rostoff
and
his
mother
the
princess
marie
the
ugly
charming
woman
with
the
beautiful
eyes
whose
goodness
illumines
the
pages
of
and
he
scarcely
knew
his
parents
those
delightful
narratives
and
have
therefore
but
little
authenticity
for
the
mother
died
when
he
was
not
yet
two
years
of
age
he
therefore
was
unable
to
recall
the
beloved
face
which
the
little
nikolas
irtenieff
evoked
beyond
a
veil
of
tears
a
face
with
a
luminous
smile
which
radiated
gladness
ah
if
in
difficult
moments
i
could
only
see
that
smile
i
should
not
know
what
sorrow
is
yet
she
doubtless
endowed
him
with
her
own
absolute
candour
her
indifference
to
opinion
and
her
wonderful
gift
of
relating
tales
of
her
own
invention
his
father
he
did
in
some
degree
remember
his
was
a
genial
yet
ironical
spirit
a
man
who
dwelt
upon
his
estates
leading
an
independent
unambitious
life
tolstoy
was
nine
years
old
when
he
lost
him
his
death
caused
him
for
the
first
time
to
understand
the
bitter
truth
and
filled
his
soul
with
despair
here
was
the
earliest
encounter
with
the
spectre
of
terror
and
henceforth
a
portion
of
his
life
was
to
be
devoted
to
fighting
the
phantom
and
a
portion
to
its
celebration
its
transfiguration
the
traces
of
this
agony
are
marked
by
a
few
unforgettable
touches
in
the
final
chapters
of
his
where
his
memories
are
transposed
in
the
narrative
of
the
death
and
burial
of
his
mother
five
children
were
left
orphans
in
the
old
house
at
yasnaya
polyana
there
leo
nikolayevitch
was
born
on
the
of
august
and
there
years
later
he
was
to
die
the
youngest
of
the
five
was
a
girl
that
marie
who
in
later
years
became
a
religious
it
was
with
her
that
tolstoy
took
refuge
in
dying
when
he
fled
from
home
and
family
of
the
four
sons
sergius
was
charming
and
selfish
sincere
to
a
degree
that
i
have
never
known
equalled
dmitri
was
passionate
selfcentred
introspective
and
in
later
years
as
a
student
abandoned
himself
eagerly
to
the
practices
of
religion
caring
nothing
for
public
opinion
fasting
seeking
out
the
poor
sheltering
the
infirm
suddenly
with
the
same
quality
of
violence
plunging
into
debauchery
then
tormented
by
remorse
ransoming
a
girl
whom
he
had
known
in
a
public
brothel
and
receiving
her
into
his
home
finally
dying
of
phthisis
at
the
age
of
nikolas
the
eldest
the
favourite
brother
had
inherited
his
mother
gift
of
imagination
her
power
of
telling
stories
ironical
nervous
and
refined
in
later
years
an
officer
in
the
caucasus
where
he
formed
the
habit
of
a
drunkard
a
man
like
his
brother
full
of
christian
kindness
living
in
hovels
and
sharing
with
the
poor
all
that
he
possessed
tourgenev
said
of
him
that
he
put
into
practice
that
humble
attitude
towards
life
which
his
brother
leo
was
content
to
develop
in
theory
the
orphans
were
cared
for
by
two
women
one
was
their
aunt
tatiana
of
whom
tolstoy
said
that
she
had
two
virtues
serenity
and
love
her
whole
life
was
love
a
devotion
that
never
failed
she
made
me
understand
the
moral
pleasure
of
loving
the
other
was
their
aunt
alexandra
who
was
for
ever
serving
others
herself
avoiding
service
dispensing
with
the
help
of
servants
her
favourite
occupation
was
reading
the
lives
of
the
saints
or
conversing
with
pilgrims
or
the
of
these
innocents
there
were
several
men
and
women
who
lived
in
the
house
one
an
old
woman
a
pilgrim
was
the
godmother
of
tolstoy
sister
another
the
idiot
gricha
knew
only
how
to
weep
and
pray
gricha
notable
christian
so
mighty
was
your
faith
that
you
felt
the
approach
of
god
so
ardent
was
your
love
that
words
rushed
from
your
lips
words
that
your
reason
could
not
control
and
how
you
used
to
celebrate
his
splendour
when
speech
failed
you
when
all
tears
you
lay
prostrated
on
the
ground
who
can
fail
to
understand
the
influence
in
the
shaping
of
tolstoy
of
all
these
humble
souls
in
some
of
them
we
seem
to
see
an
outline
a
prophecy
of
the
tolstoy
of
later
years
their
prayers
and
their
affection
must
have
sown
the
seeds
of
faith
in
the
child
mind
seeds
of
which
the
aged
man
was
to
reap
the
harvest
with
the
exception
of
the
idiot
gricha
tolstoy
does
not
speak
in
his
narrative
of
of
these
humble
helpers
who
assisted
in
the
work
of
building
up
his
mind
but
then
how
clearly
we
see
it
through
the
medium
of
the
book
this
soul
of
a
little
child
this
pure
loving
heart
a
ray
of
clear
light
which
always
discovered
in
others
the
best
of
their
qualities
this
more
than
common
tenderness
being
happy
he
ponders
on
the
only
creature
he
knows
to
be
unhappy
he
cries
at
the
thought
and
longs
to
devote
himself
to
his
good
he
hugs
and
kisses
an
ancient
horse
begging
his
pardon
because
he
has
hurt
him
he
is
happy
in
loving
even
if
he
is
not
loved
already
we
can
see
the
germs
of
his
future
genius
his
imagination
so
vivid
that
he
cries
over
his
own
stories
his
brain
always
busy
always
trying
to
discover
of
what
other
people
think
his
precocious
powers
of
memory
and
observation
the
attentive
eyes
which
even
in
the
midst
of
his
sorrow
scrutinise
the
faces
about
him
and
the
authenticity
of
their
sorrow
he
tells
us
that
at
five
years
of
age
he
felt
for
the
first
time
that
life
is
not
a
time
of
amusement
but
a
very
heavy
task
happily
he
forgot
the
discovery
in
those
days
he
used
to
soothe
his
mind
with
popular
tales
those
mythical
and
legendary
dreams
known
in
russia
as
stories
from
the
bible
above
all
the
sublime
of
joseph
which
he
cited
in
his
old
age
as
a
model
of
narrative
art
and
finally
the
arabian
nights
which
at
his
grandmother
house
were
recited
every
evening
from
the
vantage
of
the

a

of

of

him
but
effaced

professes
in
his
autobiographical

to
be

boyhood
and

he
passed
through
the
period
which
he
terms
the
desert
of
adolescence
a
desert
of
sterile
sands
blown
upon
by
gales
of
the
burning
winds
of
folly
the
pages
of
and
in
especial
those
of
are
rich
in
intimate
confessions
relating
to
these
years
he
was
a
solitary
his
brain
was
in
a
condition
of
perpetual
fever
for
a
year
he
was
completely
at
sea
he
roamed
from
one
system
of
philosophy
to
another
as
a
stoic
he
indulged
in
physical
tortures
as
an
epicurean
he
debauched
himself
then
came
a
faith
in
metempsychosis
finally
he
fell
into
a
condition
of
nihilism
not
far
removed
from
insanity
he
used
to
feel
that
if
only
he
could
turn
round
with
sufficient
rapidity
he
would
find
himself
face
to
face
with
nothingness
he
analysed
himself
continually
i
no
longer
thought
of
a
thing
i
thought
of
what
i
thought
of
it
this
perpetual
this
mechanism
of
reason
turning
in
the
void
remained
to
him
as
a
dangerous
habit
which
was
often
in
his
own
words
to
be
detrimental
to
me
in
life
but
by
which
his
art
has
profited
inexpressibly
as
another
result
of
he
had
lost
all
his
religious
convictions
or
such
was
his
belief
at
sixteen
years
of
age
ceased
to
pray
he
went
to
church
no
longer
but
his
faith
was
not
extinguished
it
was
only
smouldering
nevertheless
i
did
believe
in
something
but
in
what
i
could
not
say
i
still
believed
in
god
or
rather
i
did
not
deny
him
but
in
what
god
i
did
not
know
nor
did
i
deny
christ
and
his
teaching
but
i
could
not
have
said
precisely
what
that
doctrine
was
from
time
to
time
he
was
obsessed
by
dreams
of
goodness
he
wished
to
sell
his
carriage
and
give
the
money
to
the
poor
to
give
them
the
tenth
part
of
his
fortune
to
live
without
the
help
of
servants
for
they
were
men
like
himself
during
an
illness
he
wrote
certain
rules
of
life
he
naively
assigned
himself
the
duty
of
studying
everything
of
mastering
all
subjects
law
medicine
languages
agriculture
history
geography
and
mathematics
to
attain
the
highest
degree
of
perfection
in
music
and
painting
and
so
forth
i
had
the
conviction
that
the
destiny
of
man
was
a
process
of
incessant
insensibly
under
the
stress
of
a
boy
passions
of
a
violent
sensuality
and
a
stupendous
pride
of
self
this
faith
in
perfection
went
astray
losing
its
disinterested
quality
becoming
material
and
practical
if
he
still
wished
to
perfect
his
will
his
body
and
his
mind
it
was
in
order
to
conquer
the
world
and
to
enforce
its
love
he
wished
to
please
to
please
it
was
not
an
easy
ambition
he
was
then
of
a
simian
ugliness
the
face
was
long
heavy
brutish
the
hair
was
cropped
close
growing
low
upon
the
forehead
the
eyes
were
small
with
a
hard
forbidding
glance
deeply
sunken
in
shadowy
orbits
the
nose
was
large
the
lips
were
thick
and
protruding
and
the
ears
were
enormous
unable
to
alter
this
ugliness
which
even
as
a
child
had
subjected
him
to
fits
of
despair
he
pretended
to
a
realisation
of
the
ideal
man
of
the
world
comme
il
this
ideal
led
him
to
do
as
did
other
men
of
the
world
to
gamble
run
foolishly
into
debt
and
to
live
a
completely
dissipated
existence
one
quality
always
came
to
his
salvation
his
absolute
sincerity
do
you
know
why
i
like
you
better
than
the
others
says
nekhludov
to
his
friend
you
have
a
precious
and
surprising
quality
candour
yes
i
am
always
saying
things
which
i
am
ashamed
to
own
even
to
myself
in
his
wildest
moments
he
judges
himself
with
a
pitiless
insight
i
am
living
an
utterly
bestial
life
he
writes
in
his
i
am
as
low
as
one
can
fall
then
with
his
mania
for
analysis
he
notes
minutely
the
causes
of
his
errors
indecision
or
lack
of
energy
insolence
false
modesty
licentiousness
spirit
of
imitation
versatility
lack
of
reflection
while
still
a
student
he
was
applying
this
independence
of
judgment
to
the
criticism
of
social
conventions
and
intellectual
superstitions
he
scoffed
at
the
official
science
of
the
university
denied
the
least
importance
to
historical
studies
and
was
put
under
arrest
for
his
audacity
of
thought
at
this
period
he
discovered
rousseau
reading
his
and
the
discovery
affected
him
like
a
mental
thunderbolt
i
made
him
an
object
of
religious
worship
i
wore
a
medallion
portrait
of
him
hung
round
my
neck
as
though
it
were
a
holy
image
his
first
essays
in
philosophy
took
the
form
of
commentaries
on
rousseau
in
the
end
however
disgusted
with
the
university
and
with
smartness
he
returned
to
yasnaya
polyana
to
bury
himself
in
the
country
where
he
once
more
came
into
touch
with
the
people
he
professed
to
come
to
their
assistance
as
their
benefactor
and
their
teacher
his
experiences
of
this
period
have
been
related
in
one
of
his
earliest
books

a
remarkable
novel
whose
hero
prince
nekhludov

figures
also
in
and
in

with

and
we
must
remember
that
different
characters
appear
under
this
one
name
tolstoy
has
not
always
given
nekhludov
the
same
physical
aspect
and
the
latter
commits
suicide
at
the
end
of
the
of

different

aspects
of

with
his
worst
and
his
best
characteristics
is
tolstoy
in
disguise
nekhludov
is
twenty
years
old
he
has
left
the
university
to
devote
himself
to
his
peasants
he
has
been
labouring
for
a
year
to
do
them
good
in
the
course
of
a
visit
to
the
village
we
see
him
striving
against
jeering
indifference
rooted
distrust
routine
apathy
vice
and
ingratitude
all
his
efforts
are
in
vain
he
returns
indoors
discouraged
and
muses
on
his
dreams
of
a
year
ago
his
generous
enthusiasm
his
idea
that
love
and
goodness
were
one
with
happiness
and
truth
the
only
happiness
and
the
only
truth
possible
in
this
world
he
feels
himself
defeated
he
is
weary
and
ashamed
seated
before
the
piano
his
hand
unconsciously
moved
upon
the
keys
a
chord
sounded
then
a
second
then
a
third
he
began
to
play
the
chords
were
not
always
perfect
in
rhythm
they
were
often
obvious
to
the
point
of
banality
they
did
not
reveal
any
talent
for
music
but
they
gave
him
a
melancholy
indefinable
sense
of
pleasure
at
each
change
of
key
he
awaited
with
a
flutter
of
the
heart
for
what
was
about
to
follow
his
imagination
vaguely
supplementing
the
deficiencies
of
the
actual
sound
he
heard
a
choir
an
orchestra
and
his
keenest
pleasure
arose
from
the
enforced
activity
of
his
imagination
which
brought
before
him
without
logical
connection
but
with
astonishing
clearness
the
most
varied
scenes
and
images
of
the
past
and
the
future
once
more
he
sees
the
moujiks
vicious
distrustful
lying
idle
obstinate
contrary
with
whom
he
has
lately
been
speaking
but
this
time
he
sees
them
with
all
their
good
qualities
and
without
their
vices
he
sees
into
their
hearts
with
the
intuition
of
love
he
sees
therein
their
patience
their
resignation
to
the
fate
which
is
crushing
them
their
forgiveness
of
wrongs
their
family
affection
and
the
causes
of
their
pious
mechanical
attachment
to
the
past
he
recalls
their
days
of
honest
labour
healthy
and
fatiguing
is
beautiful
he
murmurs
why
am
i
not
one
of
these
the
entire
tolstoy
is
already
contained
in
the
hero
of
this
first
novel
his
piercing
vision
and
his
persistent
illusions
he
observes
men
and
women
with
an
impeccable
realism
but
no
sooner
does
he
close
his
eyes
than
his
dreams
resume
their
sway
his
dreams
and
his
love
of
mankind
from
to
science
was
as
yet
unorganised
and
its
teachers
even
in
western
europe
had
not
the
courage
of
the
facts
they
taught
men
still
sought
for
an
anchor
in
the
philosophic
systems
of
the
ancients
the
theory
of
evolution
put
forward
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
had
fallen
into
obscurity
science
was
dry
dogmatic
uncoordinated
insignificant
hence
perhaps
the
contempt
for
science
which
distinguished
tolstoy
throughout
his
life
and
which
made

dated

youth
the

tolstoy
in
the
year
was
not
as
patient
as
nekhludov
yasnaya
polyana
had
disillusioned
and
disappointed
him
he
was
as
weary
of
the
people
as
he
was
of
the
world
of
fashion
his
attitude
as
benefactor
wearied
him
he
could
bear
it
no
more
moreover
he
was
harassed
by
creditors
in
he
escaped
to
the
caucasus
to
the
army
in
which
his
brother
nikolas
was
already
an
officer
he
had
hardly
arrived
hardly
tasted
the
quiet
of
the
mountains
before
he
was
once
more
master
of
himself
before
he
had
recovered
his
god
last
night
i
hardly
slept
i
began
to
pray
to
god
i
can
not
possibly
express
the
sweetness
of
the
feeling
that
came
to
me
when
i
prayed
i
recited
the
customary
prayers
but
i
went
on
praying
for
a
long
time
i
felt
the
desire
of
something
very
great
very
beautiful
what
i
can
not
say
what
i
wanted
to
be
one
with
the
infinite
being
to
be
dissolved
comprehended
in
him
i
begged
him
to
forgive
me
my
trespasses
but
no
i
did
not
beg
him
i
felt
that
he
did
pardon
me
since
he
granted
me
that
moment
of
wonderful
joy
i
was
praying
yet
at
the
same
time
i
felt
that
i
could
not
dared
not
pray
i
thanked
him
not
in
words
but
in
thought
scarcely
an
hour
had
passed
and
i
was
listening
to
the
voice
of
vice
i
fell
asleep
dreaming
of
glory
of
women
it
was
stronger
than
i
never
mind
i
thank
god
for
that
moment
of
happiness
for
showing
me
my
pettiness
and
my
greatness
i
want
to
pray
but
i
do
not
know
how
i
want
to
understand
but
i
dare
not
i
abandon
myself
to
thy
will
the
flesh
was
not
conquered
not
then
nor
ever
the
struggle
between
god
and
the
passions
of
man

the
silence

his
heart
tolstoy
speaks
in
his
of
the
three
demons
which
were
devouring
him
passion
for
possible
struggle
struggle
very
difficult
the
most
terrible
of
all
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
dreaming
of
living
for
others
and
of
sacrificing
himself
voluptuous
or
futile
thoughts
would
assail
him
the
image
of
some
cossack
woman
or
the
despair
he
would
feel
if
his
moustache
were
higher
on
one
side
than
the
other
no
matter
god
was
there
he
would
not
forsake
him
even
the
effervescence
of
the
struggle
was
fruitful
all
the
forces
of
life
were
exalted
thereby
i
think
the
idea
of
making
a
journey
to
the
caucasus
however
frivolous
at
the
time

conception
was
inspired

me
from
above

hand
has
guided
me
i
never
cease
to
thank
him
i
feel
that
i
have
become
better
here
and
i
am
firmly
convinced
that
whatever
happens
to
me
can
only
be
for

it

in

on
the
of
july
it
is
curious
to
note
that
while
in
the
midst
of
that
nature
by
which
he
was
so
intoxicated
while
leading
a
life
absolutely
novel
in
the
midst
of
the
stirring
risks
of
warfare
occupied
in
the
discovery
of
a
world
of
unfamiliar
characters
and
passions
tolstoy
should
have
returned
in
this
his
first
work
to
the
memories
of
his
past
life
but
was
written
during
a
period
of
illness
when
his
military
activity
was
suddenly
arrested
during
the
long
leisure
of
a
convalescence
while
alone
and
suffering
his
state
of
mind
inclined
to
the
sentimental
the
past
unrolled
itself
before
his
eyes
at
a
time
when
he
felt
for
it
a
certain
tenderness
after
the
exhausting
tension
of
the
last
few
unprofitable
years
it
was
comforting
to
live
again
in
thought
the
marvellous
innocent
joyous
poetic
period
of
early
childhood
to
reconstruct
for
himself
the
heart
of
a
child
good
sensitive
and
capable
of
love
with
the
ardour
of
youth
and
its
illimitable
projects
with
the
cyclic
character
of
his
poetic
imagination
which
rarely
conceived
an
isolated
subject
and
whose
great
romances
are
only
the
links
in
a
long
historic
chain
the
fragments
of
enormous
conceptions
which
he
was
never
able
to
execute
tolstoy
at
this
moment
regarded
his
narrative
of
as
merely
the
opening
chapters
of
a
of
four
which
was
to
include
his
life
in
the
caucasus
and
was
in
all
probability
to
have
terminated
in
the
revelation
of
god
by
nature
in
later
years
tolstoy
spoke
with
great
severity
of
his
to
which
he
owed
some
part
of
his
popularity
it
is
so
bad
he
remarked
to
birukov
it
is
written
with
so
little
literary
conscience
there
is
nothing
to
be
got
from
it
he
was
alone
in
this
opinion
the
manuscript
was
sent
without
the
author
name
to
the
great
russian
review
the
it
was
published
immediately
september
and
achieved
a
general
success
a
success
confirmed
by
the
public
of
every
country
in
europe
yet
in
spite
of
its
poetic
charm
its
delicacy
of
touch
and
emotion
we
can
understand
that
it
may
have
displeased
the
tolstoy
of
later
years
it
displeased
him
for
the
very
reasons
by
which
it
pleased
others
we
must
admit
it
frankly
except
in
the
recording
of
certain
provincial
types
and
in
a
restricted
number
of
passages
which
are
remarkable
for
their
religious
feeling
or
for
the
realistic
treatment
of
emotion
the
personality
of
tolstoy
is
barely
in
evidence
a
tender
gentle
sentimentality
prevails
from
cover
to
cover
a
quality
which
was
always
afterwards
antipathetic
to
tolstoy
and
one
which
he
sedulously
excluded
from
his
other
romances
we
recognise
it
these
tears
this
sentimentality
came
from
dickens
who
was
one
of
tolstoy
favourite
authors
between
his
fourteenth
and
his
year
tolstoy
notes
in
his
dickens
influence
considerable
he
read
the
book
again
in
the
caucasus
two
other
influences
to
which
he
himself
confesses
were
sterne
and
töppfer
i
was
then
he
says
under
their
inspiration
who
would
have
thought
that
the
would
be
the
first
model
of
the
author
of
and
peace
yet
knowing
this
to
be
a
fact
we
discern
in
tolstoy
the
same
bantering
affected
geniality
transplanted
to
the
soil
of
a
more
aristocratic
nature
so
we
see
that
the
readers
of
his
earliest
efforts
found
the
writer
countenance
familiar
it
was
not
long
however
before
his
own
personality
found
his
though
less
pure
and
less
perfect
than
exhibits
a
more
original
power
of
psychology
a
keen
feeling
for
nature
and
a
mind
full
of
distress
and
conflict
which
dickens
or
töppfer
would
have
been
at
a
loss
to
express
in
the
october
tolstoy
character
appeared
sharply
defined
marked
by
his
fearless
sincerity
and
his
faith
in
love
among
the
remarkable
portraits
of
peasants
which
he
has
painted
in
this
novel
we
find
an
early
sketch
of
one
of
the
finest
conceptions
of
his
tales
the
old
man
with
the
beehives
a
the
little
old
man
under
the
his
hands
outstretched
his
eyes
raised
his
bald
head
shining
in
the
sun
and
all
around
him
the
bees
touched
with
gold
never
stinging
him
forming
a
halo
but
the
truly
typical
works
of
this
period
are
those
which
directly
register
his
present
emotions
namely
the
novels
of
the
caucasus
the
first
finished
in
december
impresses
the
reader
deeply
by
the
magnificence
of
its
landscapes
a
sunrise
amidst
the
mountains
on
the
bank
of
a
river
a
wonderful
with
sounds
and
shadows
noted
with
a
striking
intensity
and
the
return
in
the
evening
while
the
distant
snowy
peaks
disappear
in
the
violet
haze
and
the
clear
voices
of
the
regimental
singers
rise
and
fall
in
the
transparent
air
many
of
the
types
of
and
are
here
drawn
to
the
life
captain
khlopoff
the
true
hero
who
by
no
means
fights
because
he
likes
fighting
but
because
it
is
his
duty
a
man
with
one
of
those
truly
russian
faces
placid
and
simple
and
eyes
into
which
it
is
easy
and
agreeable
to
gaze
heavy
awkward
a
trifle
ridiculous
indifferent
to
his
surroundings
he
alone
is
unchanged
in
battle
where
all
the
rest
are
changed
he
is
exactly
as
we
have
seen
him
always
with
the
same
quiet
movements
the
same
level
voice
the
same
expression
of
simplicity
on
his
heavy
simple
face
next
comes
the
lieutenant
who
imitates
the
heroes
of
lermontov
a
most
kindly
affectionate
boy
who
professes
the
utmost
ferocity
then
comes
the
poor
little
subaltern
delighted
at
the
idea
of
his
first
action
brimming
over
with
affection
ready
to
fall
on
his
comrade
neck
a
laughable
adorable
boy
who
like
petia
rostoff
contrives
to
get
stupidly
killed
in
the
centre
of
the
picture
is
the
figure
of
tolstoy
the
observer
who
is
mentally
aloof
from
his
comrades
and
already
utters
his
cry
of
protest
against
warfare
is
it
impossible
then
for
men
to
live
in
peace
in
this
world
so
full
of
beauty
under
this
immeasurable
starry
sky
how
is
it
they
are
able
here
to
retain
their
feelings
of
hostility
and
vengeance
and
the
lust
of
destroying
their
fellows
all
there
is
of
evil
in
the
human
heart
ought
to
disappear
at
the
touch
of
nature
that
most
immediate
expression
of
the
beautiful
and
the
good
other
tales
of
the
caucasus
were
to
follow
which
were
observed
at
this
time
though
not
written
until
a
later
period
in
was
written
a
book
notable
for
its
exact
and
rather
frigid
realism
full
of
curious
records
of
russian
notes
to
be
made
use
of
in
the
future
in
appeared
brush
with
the
in
which
there
is
a
man
of
the
world
a
degraded
officer
a
wreck
a
coward
a
drunkard
and
a
liar
who
can
not
support
the
idea
of
being
slaughtered
like
one
of
the
common
soldiers
he
despises
the
least
of
whom
is
worth
a
hundred
of
himself
above
all
these
works
as
the
summit
so
to
speak
of
this
first
mountain
range
rises
one
of
the
most
beautiful
lyric
romances
that
ever
fell
from
tolstoy
pen
the
song
of
his
youth
the
poem
of
the
caucasus
the
splendour
of
the
snowy
mountains
displaying
their
noble
lines
against
the
luminous
sky
fills
the
whole
work
with
its
music
the
book
is
unique
for
it
belongs
to
the
of
genius
the
omnipotent
god
of
youth
as
tolstoy
says
that
rapture
which
never
returns
what
a
torrent
what
an
overflow
of
love
love
i
love
so
much
how
brave
how
good
he
repeated
and
he
felt
as
though
he
must
weep
why
who
was
brave
and
whom
did
he
love
that
he
did
not
precisely
know
this
intoxication
of
the
heart
flows
on
unchecked
olenin
the
hero
who
has
come
to
the
caucasus
as
tolstoy
came
to
steep
himself
in
nature
in
the
life
of
adventure
becomes
enamoured
of
a
young
cossack
girl
and
abandons
himself
to
the
medley
of
his
contradictory
aspirations
at
one
moment
he
believes
that
happiness
is
to
live
for
others
to
sacrifice
oneself
at
another
that
is
only
stupidity
finally
he
is
inclined
to
believe
with
erochta
the
old
cossack
that
everything
is
precious
god
has
made
everything
for
the
delight
of
man
nothing
is
a
sin
to
amuse
oneself
with
a
handsome
girl
is
not
a
sin
it
is
only
health
but
what
need
to
think
at
all
it
is
enough
to
live
life
is
all
good
all
happiness
life
is
and
universal
life
is
god
an
ardent
naturalism
uplifts
and
consumes
his
soul
lost
in
the
forest
amidst
the
wildness
of
the
woods
the
multitude
of
birds
and
animals
the
clouds
of
midges
in
the
dusky
green
in
the
warm
fragrant
air
amidst
the
little
runlets
of
water
which
trickle
everywhere
beneath
the
boughs
a
few
paces
from
the
ambushes
of
the
enemy
olenin
is
seized
suddenly
by
such
a
sense
of
causeless
happiness
that
in
obedience
to
childish
habit
he
crossed
himself
and
began
to
give
thanks
to
somebody
like
a
hindu
fakir
he
rejoices
to
tell
himself
that
he
is
alone
and
lost
in
this
maëlstrom
of
aspiring
life
that
myriads
of
invisible
beings
hidden
on
every
hand
are
that
moment
hunting
him
to
death
that
these
thousands
of
little
insects
humming
around
him
are
calling
here
brothers
here
here
is
some
one
to
bite
and
it
became
obvious
to
him
that
he
was
no
longer
a
russian
gentleman
in
moscow
society
but
simply
a
creature
like
the
midge
the
pheasant
the
stag
like
those
which
were
living
and
prowling
about
him
at
that
moment
like
them
i
shall
live
i
shall
die
and
the
grass
will
grow
above
me
and
his
heart
is
full
of
happiness
tolstoy
lives
through
this
hour
of
youth
in
a
delirium
of
vitality
and
the
love
of
life
he
embraces
nature
and
sinks
himself
in
her
being
to
her
he
pours
forth
and
exalts
his
griefs
his
joys
and
his
loves
in
her
he
lulls
them
to
sleep
yet
this
romantic
intoxication
never
veils
the
lucidity
of
his
perceptions
nowhere
has
he
painted
landscape
with
a
greater
power
than
in
this
fervent
poem
nowhere
has
he
depicted
the
type
with
greater
truth
the
contrast
of
nature
with
the
world
of
men
which
forms
the
basis
of
the
book
and
which
through
all
tolstoy
life
is
to
prove
one
of
his
favourite
themes
and
an
article
of
his
has
already
inspired
him
the
better
to
castigate
the
world
with
something
of
the
bitterness
to
be
heard
in
the
but
for
those
who
love
him
he
is
no
less
truly
himself
and
the
creatures
of
nature
the
beautiful
cossack
girl
and
her
friends
are
seen
under
a
searching
light
with
their
egoism
their
cupidity
their
venality
and
all
their
vices
an
exceptional
occasion
was
about
to
offer
itself
for
the
exercise
of
this
heroic
veracity
published
in
english
as
part
of
boyhood
his
letters
of
this
period
to
his
aunt
tatiana
are
full
of
tears
and
of
sentimentality
he
was
as
he
says
leo
the
sniveller
january
the
landlord
is
the
fragment
of
a
projected
of
a
russian
landowner
the
forms
the
first
portion
of
a
great
romance
of
the
caucasus
in
the
author
eyes
the
huge
and
was
only
a
sort
of
preface
to
a
contemporary
epic
of
which
was
to
have
been
the
nucleus
see
the
passage
relating
to
the
pilgrim
gricha
or
to
the
death
of
his
mother
letter
to
birukov
completed
only
in
two
old
although
completed
much
later
in
and
appearing
only
in
the
bulk
of
this
volume
was
of
this
period
for
example

oleniln
letter
to
his
friends
in
russia
chapter
v
sebastopol
war
and
religion
in
november
war
was
declared
upon
turkey
tolstoy
obtained
an
appointment
to
the
army
of
roumania
he
was
transferred
to
the
army
of
the
crimea
and
on
november
he
arrived
in
sebastopol
he
was
burning
with
enthusiasm
and
patriotic
faith
he
went
about
his
duties
courageously
and
was
often
in
danger
in
especial
throughout
the
april
and
may
of
when
he
served
on
every
alternate
day
in
the
battery
of
of
the
bastion
living
for
months
in
a
perpetual
tremor
and
exaltation
face
to
face
with
death
his
religious
mysticism
revived
he
became
familiar
with
god
in
april
he
noted
in
his
diary
a
prayer
to
god
thanking
him
for
his
protection
in
danger
and
beseeching
him
to
continue
it
so
that
i
may
achieve
the
glorious
and
eternal
end
of
life
of
which
i
am
still
ignorant
although
i
feel
a
presentiment
of
it
already
this
object
of
his
life
was
not
art
but
religion
on
march
he
wrote
i
have
been
led
to
conceive
a
great
idea
to
whose
realisation
i
feel
capable
of
devoting
my
whole
life
this
idea
is
the
foundation
of
a
new
religion
the
religion
of
the
christ
but
purified
of
dogmas
and
mysteries
to
act
with
a
clear
conscience
in
order
to
unite
men
by
means
of
religion
this
was
to
be
the
programme
of
his
old
age
however
to
distract
himself
from
the
spectacles
which
surrounded
him
he
began
once
more
to
write
how
could
he
amidst
that
hail
of
lead
find
the
necessary
freedom
of
mind
for
the
writing
of
the
third
part
of
his
memories
the
book
is
chaotic
and
we
may
attribute
to
the
conditions
of
its
production
a
quality
of
disorder
and
at
times
a
certain
dryness
of
abstract
analysis
which
is
increased
by
divisions
and
subdivisions
after
the
manner
of
stendhal
yet
we
admire
his
calm
penetration
of
the
mist
of
dreams
and
inchoate
ideas
which
crowd
a
young
brain
his
work
is
extraordinarily
true
to
itself
and
at
moments
what
poetic
freshness
as
in
the
vivid
picture
of
springtime
in
the
city
or
the
tale
of
the
confession
and
the
journey
to
the
convent
on
account
of
the
forgotten
sin
an
impassioned
pantheism
lends
to
certain
pages
a
lyric
beauty
whose
accents
recall
the
tales
of
the
caucasus
for
example
this
description
of
an
evening
in
the
spring
the
calm
splendour
of
the
shining
crescent
the
gleaming
the
ancient
whose
boughs
were
on
one
side
silvered
by
the
moonlight
while
on
the
other
they
covered
the
path
and
the
bushes
with
their
black
shadows
the
cry
of
a
quail
beyond
the
pond
the
barely
perceptible
sound
of
two
ancient
trees
which
grazed
one
another
the
humming
of
the
mosquitoes
the
fall
of
an
apple
on
the
dry
leaves
and
the
frogs
leaping
up
to
the
steps
of
the
terrace
their
backs
gleaming
greenish
under
a
ray
of
moonlight
the
moon
is
mounting
suspended
in
the
limpid
sky
she
fills
all
space
with
her
light
the
splendour
of
the
moonlit
water
grows
yet
more
brilliant
the
shadows
grow
blacker
the
light
more
transparent
and
to
me
an
obscure
and
earthy
creature
already
soiled
with
every
human
passion
but
endowed
with
all
the
stupendous
power
of
love
it
seemed
at
that
moment
that
all
nature
the
moon
and
i
myself
were
one
and
the
same
but
the
present
reality
potent
and
imperious
spoke
more
loudly
than
the
dreams
of
the
past
remained
unfinished
and
captain
count
tolstoy
behind
the
plating
of
his
bastion
amid
the
rumbling
of
the
bombardment
or
in
the
midst
of
his
company
observed
the
dying
and
the
living
and
recorded
their
miseries
and
his
own
in
his
unforgettable
narratives
of
these
three
sebastopol
in
december
sebastopol
in
may
sebastopol
in
august
are
generally
confounded
with
one
another
but
in
reality
they
present
many
points
of
difference
the
second
in
particular
in
point
both
of
feeling
and
of
art
is
greatly
superior
to
the
others
the
others
are
dominated
by
patriotism
the
second
is
charged
with
implacable
truth
it
is
said
that
after
reading
the
first
narrative
the
tsarina
wept
and
the
tsar
moved
by
admiration
commanded
that
the
story
should
be
translated
into
french
and
the
author
sent
out
of
danger
we
can
readily
believe
it
nothing
in
these
pages
but
exalts
warfare
and
the
fatherland
tolstoy
had
just
arrived
his
enthusiasm
was
intact
he
was
afloat
on
a
tide
of
heroism
as
yet
he
could
see
in
the
defenders
of
sebastopol
neither
ambition
nor
vanity
nor
any
unworthy
feeling
for
him
the
war
was
a
sublime
epic
its
heroes
were
worthy
of
greece
on
the
other
hand
these
notes
exhibit
no
effort
of
the
imagination
no
attempt
at
objective
representation
the
writer
strolls
through
the
city
he
sees
with
the
utmost
lucidity
but
relates
what
he
sees
in
a
form
which
is
wanting
in
freedom
you
see
you
enter
you
notice
this
is
reporting
rich
in
admirable
impressions
very
different
is
the
second
scene
in
may
in
the
opening
lines
we
read
here
the
the
vanity
of
thousands
of
human
beings
is
in
conflict
or
appeased
in
death
and
further
on
and
as
there
were
many
men
so
also
were
there
many
forms
of
vanity
vanity
vanity
everywhere
vanity
even
at
the
door
of
the
tomb
it
is
the
peculiar
malady
of
our
century
why
do
the
homers
and
shakespeares
speak
of
love
of
glory
and
of
suffering
and
why
is
the
literature
of
our
century
nothing
but
the
interminable
history
of
snobs
and
egotists
the
narrative
which
is
no
longer
a
simple
narrative
on
the
part
of
the
author
but
one
which
sets
before
us
men
and
their
passions
reveals
that
which
is
concealed
by
the
mask
of
heroism
tolstoy
clear
disillusioned
gaze
plumbs
to
the
depths
the
hearts
of
his
companions
in
arms
in
them
as
in
himself
he
reads
pride
fear
and
the
comedy
of
those
who
continue
to
play
at
life
though
rubbing
shoulders
with
death
fear
especially
is
avowed
stripped
of
its
veils
and
shown
in
all
its
nakedness
these
nervous
crises
this
obsession
of
death
are
analysed
with
a
terrible
sincerity
that
knows
neither
shame
nor
pity
it
was
at
sebastopol
that
tolstoy
learned
to
eschew
sentimentalism
that
vague
feminine
whimpering
passion
as
he
came
disdainfully
to
term
it
and
his
genius
for
analysis
the
instinct
for
which
awoke
as
we
saw
in
the
later
years
of
his
boyhood
and
which
was
at
times
to
assume
a
quality
almost
morbid
never
attained
to
a
more
hypnotic
and
poignant
intensity
than
in
the
narrative
of
the
death
of
praskhoukhin
two
whole
pages
are
devoted
to
the
description
of
all
that
passed
in
the
mind
of
the
unhappy
man
during
the
second
following
upon
the
fall
of
the
shell
while
the
fuse
was
hissing
towards
explosion
and
one
page
deals
with
all
that
passed
before
him
after
it
exploded
when
he
was
killed
on
the
spot
by
a
fragment
which
struck
him
full
in
the
chest
as
in
the
intervals
of
a
drama
we
hear
the
occasional
music
of
the
orchestra
so
these
scenes
of
battle
are
interrupted
by
wide
glimpses
of
nature
deep
perspectives
of
light
the
symphony
of
the
day
dawning
upon
the
splendid
landscape
in
the
midst
of
which
thousands
are
agonising
tolstoy
the
christian
forgetting
the
patriotism
of
his
first
narrative
curses
this
impious
war
and
these
men
christians
who
profess
the
same
great
law
of
love
and
of
sacrifice
do
not
when
they
perceive
what
they
have
done
fall
upon
their
knees
repentant
before
him
who
in
giving
them
life
set
within
the
heart
of
each
together
with
the
fear
of
death
the
love
of
the
good
and
the
beautiful
they
do
not
embrace
as
brothers
with
tears
of
joy
and
happiness
as
he
was
completing
this
novel
a
work
that
has
a
quality
of
bitterness
which
hitherto
none
of
his
work
had
betrayed
tolstoy
was
seized
with
doubt
had
he
done
wrong
to
speak
a
painful
doubt
assails
me
perhaps
these
things
should
not
have
been
said
perhaps
what
i
am
telling
is
one
of
those
mischievous
truths
which
unconsciously
hidden
in
the
mind
of
each
one
of
us
should
not
be
expressed
lest
they
become
harmful
like
the
lees
that
we
must
not
stir
lest
we
spoil
the
wine
if
so
when
is
the
expression
of
evil
to
be
avoided
when
is
the
expression
of
goodness
to
be
imitated
who
is
the
malefactor
and
who
is
the
hero
all
are
good
and
all
are
evil
but
he
proudly
regains
his
poise
the
protagonist
of
my
novel
whom
i
love
with
all
the
strength
of
my
soul
whom
i
try
to
present
in
all
her
beauty
who
always
was
is
and
shall
be
beautiful
is
truth
after
reading
these
pages
nekrasov
the
editor
of
the
review
wrote
to
tolstoy
that
is
precisely
what
russian
society
needs
the
truth
the
truth
of
which
since
the
death
of
gogol
so
little
has
remained
in
russian
letters
this
truth
which
you
bring
to
our
art
is
something
quite
novel
with
us
i
have
only
one
fear
lest
the
times
and
the
cowardice
of
life
the
deafness
and
dumbness
of
all
that
surrounds
us
may
make
of
you
what
it
has
made
of
most
of
us
lest
it
may
kill
the
energy
in
you
nothing
of
the
kind
was
to
be
feared
the
times
which
waste
the
energies
of
ordinary
men
only
tempered
those
of
tolstoy
yet
for
a
moment
the
trials
of
his
country
and
the
capture
of
sebastopol
aroused
a
feeling
of
regret
for
his
perhaps
too
unfeeling
frankness
together
with
a
feeling
of
sorrowful
affection
in
his
third
narrative
in
august
while
describing
a
group
of
officers
playing
cards
and
quarrelling
he
interrupts
himself
to
say
but
let
us
drop
the
curtain
quickly
over
this
picture
perhaps
each
of
these
men
will
go
cheerfully
to
meet
his
death
in
the
depths
of
the
soul
of
each
there
smoulders
the
spark
of
nobility
which
will
make
him
a
hero
although
this
shame
detracts
in
no
wise
from
the
forcefulness
and
realism
of
the
narrative
the
choice
of
characters
shows
plainly
enough
where
lie
the
sympathies
of
the
writer
the
epic
of
malakoff
and
its
heroic
fall
is
told
as
affecting
two
rare
and
touching
figures
two
brothers
of
whom
the
elder
kozeltoff
has
some
of
the
characteristics
of
tolstoy
who
can
forget
the
younger
the
ensign
volodya
timid
and
enthusiastic
with
his
feverish
monologues
his
dreams
his
tears
tears
that
rise
to
his
eyes
for
a
mere
nothing
tears
of
tenderness
tears
of
humiliation
his
fear
during
the
first
hours
passed
in
the
bastion
the
poor
boy
is
still
afraid
of
the
dark
and
covers
his
head
with
his
cloak
when
he
goes
to
bed
the
oppression
caused
by
the
feeling
of
his
own
solitude
and
the
indifference
of
others
then
when
the
hour
arrives
his
joy
in
danger
he
belongs
to
the
group
of
poetic
figures
of
youth
of
whom
are
petia
in
and
and
the
in
who
their
hearts
full
of
affection
make
war
with
laughter
on
their
lips
and
are
broken
suddenly
uncomprehending
on
the
wheel
of
death
the
two
brothers
fall
wounded
both
on
the
same
day
the
last
day
of
the
defence
the
novel
ends
with
these
lines
in
which
we
hear
the
muttering
of
a
patriotic
anger
the
army
was
leaving
the
town
and
each
soldier
as
he
looked
upon
deserted
sebastopol
sighed
with
an
inexpressible
bitterness
in
his
heart
and
shook
his
fist
in
the
direction
of
the
enemy
we
notice
this
manner
also
in
which
was
completed
at
the
same
period
for
example
there
are
three
kinds
of
love
æsthetic
love
devoted
love
active
love
there
are
three
kinds
of
soldiers
the
docile
and
subordinate
the
authoritative
the
boasters
who
themselves
are
subdivided
into
a
the
docile
who
are
cool
and
lethargic
b
those
who
are
earnestly
docile
c
docile
soldiers
who
drink
xxxii
sent
to
the
review
and
immediately
published
tolstoy
refers
to
them
again
at
a
much
later
date
in
his
with
his
friend
teneromo
he
tells
him
of
a
crisis
of
terror
which
assailed
him
one
night
when
he
was
lying
down
in
the
lodgement
dug
out
of
the
body
of
the
rampart
under
the
protective
plating
this
of
the
siege
of
will
be
found
in
the
volume
entitled
droujinine
a
little
later
wrote
him
a
friendly
letter
in
which
he
sought
to
put
him
on
his
guard
against
this
danger
you
have
a
tendency
to
an
excessive
minuteness
of
analysis
it
may
become
a
serious
fault
sometimes
you
seem
on
the
point
of
saying
that
calf
indicated
a
desire
to
travel
in
the
indies
you
must
restrain
this
tendency
but
do
not
for
the
world
suppress

letter
dated
cited
by
p
birukov
mutilated
by
the
censor
september
in
when
writing
a
preface
to
of
sebastopol
by
an
officer
of
erchoff
tolstoy
returned
in
fancy
to
these
scenes
every
heroic
memory
had
disappeared
he
could
no
longer
remember
anything
but
the
fear
which
lasted
for
seven
months
the
double
fear
the
fear
of
death
and
the
fear
of
shame
and
the
horrible
moral
torture
all
the
exploits
of
the
siege
reduced
themselves
for
him
to
this
he
had
been
flesh
for
cannon
chapter
vi
petersburg
when
once
issued
from
this
hell
where
for
a
year
he
had
touched
the
extreme
of
the
passions
vanities
and
sorrows
of
humanity
tolstoy
found
himself
in
november
amidst
the
men
of
letters
of
petersburg
they
inspired
him
with
a
feeling
of
disdain
and
disillusion
they
seemed
to
him
entirely
mean
and
untruthful
these
men
who
appeared
in
the
distance
to
wear
the
halo
of
art
even
tourgenev
whom
he
had
admired
and
to
whom
he
had
but
lately
dedicated
even
he
seen
close
at
hand
had
bitterly
disappointed
him
a
portrait
of
represents
him
in
the
midst
of
them
tourgenev
gontcharov
ostrovsky
grigorovitch
droujinine
he
strikes
one
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
others
by
reason
of
his
hard
ascetic
air
his
bony
head
his
lined
cheeks
his
rigidly
folded
arms
standing
upright
in
uniform
behind
these
men
of
letters
he
has
the
appearance
as
suarès
has
wittily
said
rather
of
mounting
guard
over
these
gentry
than
of
making
one
of
their
company
as
though
he
were
ready
to
march
them
back
to
gaol
yet
they
all
gathered
about
their
young
colleague
who
came
to
them
with
the
twofold
glory
of
the
writer
and
the
hero
of
sebastopol
tourgenev
who
had
wept
and
shouted
while
reading
the
pages
of
held
out
a
brotherly
hand
but
the
two
men
could
not
understand
one
another
although
both
saw
the
world
with
the
same
clear
vision
they
mingled
with
that
vision
the
hues
of
their
inimical
minds
the
one
ironic
resonant
amorous
disillusioned
a
devotee
of
beauty
the
other
proud
violent
tormented
with
moral
ideas
pregnant
with
a
hidden
god
what
tolstoy
could
never
forgive
in
these
literary
men
was
that
they
believed
themselves
an
elect
superior
caste
the
crown
of
humanity
into
his
antipathy
for
them
there
entered
a
good
deal
of
the
pride
of
the
great
noble
and
the
officer
who
condescendingly
mingles
with
liberal
and
scribblers
it
was
also
a
characteristic
of
his
he
himself
knew
it
to
oppose
instinctively
all
trains
of
reasoning
all
conclusions
which
were
generally
admitted
a
distrust
of
mankind
a
latent
contempt
for
human
reason
made
him
always
on
the
alert
to
discover
deception
in
himself
or
others
he
never
believed
in
the
sincerity
of
any
one
all
moral
exhilaration
seemed
false
to
him
and
he
had
a
way
of
fixing
with
that
extraordinarily
piercing
gaze
of
his
the
man
whom
he
suspected
was
not
telling
the
truth
how
he
used
to
listen
how
he
used
to
gaze
at
those
who
spoke
to
him
from
the
very
depths
of
his
grey
eyes
deeply
sunken
in
their
orbits
with
what
irony
his
lips
were
pressed
together
tourgenev
used
to
say
that
he
had
never
experienced
anything
more
painful
than
this
piercing
gaze
which
together
with
two
or
three
words
of
envenomed
observation
was
capable
of
infuriating
anybody
at
their
first
meetings
violent
scenes
occurred
between
tolstoy
and
tourgenev
when
at
a
distance
they
cooled
down
and
tried
to
do
one
another
justice
but
as
time
went
on
tolstoy
dislike
of
his
literary
surroundings
grew
deeper
he
could
not
forgive
these
artists
for
the
combination
of
their
depraved
life
and
their
moral
pretensions
i
acquired
the
conviction
that
nearly
all
were
immoral
men
unsound
without
character
greatly
inferior
to
those
i
had
met
in
my
bohemian
military
life
and
they
were
sure
of
themselves
and
selfcontent
as
men
might
be
who
were
absolutely
sound
they
disgusted
me
he
parted
from
them
but
he
did
not
at
once
lose
their
interested
faith
in
art
his
pride
was
flattered
thereby
it
was
a
faith
which
was
richly
rewarded
it
brought
him
women
money
fame
of
this
religion
i
was
one
of
the
pontiffs
an
agreeable
and
highly
profitable
situation
the
better
to
consecrate
himself
to
this
religion
he
sent
in
his
resignation
from
the
army
november
but
a
man
of
his
temper
could
not
close
his
eyes
for
long
he
believed
he
was
eager
to
believe
in
progress
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
word
signified
something
a
journey
abroad
which
lasted
from
the
end
of
january
to
the
end
of
july
of
during
which
period
he
visited
france
switzerland
and
germany
resulted
in
the
destruction
of
this
faith
in
paris
on
the
of
april
the
spectacle
of
a
public
execution
showed
him
the
emptiness
of
the
superstition
of
progress
when
i
saw
the
head
part
from
the
body
and
fall
into
the
basket
i
understood
in
every
recess
of
my
being
that
no
theory
as
to
the
reason
of
the
present
order
of
things
could
justify
such
an
act
even
though
all
the
men
in
the
world
supported
by
this
or
that
theory
were
to
find
it
necessary
i
myself
should
know
that
it
was
wrong
for
it
is
not
what
men
say
or
do
that
decides
what
is
good
or
bad
but
my
own
heart
in
the
month
of
july
the
sight
of
a
little
perambulating
singer
at
lucerne
to
whom
the
wealthy
english
visitors
at
the
schweizerhof
were
refusing
alms
made
him
express
in
the
of
prince
his
contempt
for
all
the
illusions
dear
to
liberals
and
for
those
who
trace
imaginary
lines
upon
the
sea
of
good
and
evil
for
them
civilisation
is
good
barbarism
is
bad
liberty
is
good
slavery
is
bad
and
this
imaginary
knowledge
destroys
the
instinctive
primordial
cravings
which
are
the
best
who
will
define
them
for
me
liberty
despotism
civilisation
barbarism
where
does
not
good
with
evil
there
is
within
us
only
one
infallible
guide
the
universal
spirit
which
whispers
to
us
to
draw
closer
to
one
another
on
his
return
to
russia
and
yasnaya
he
once
more
busied
himself
about
the
peasants
not
that
he
had
any
illusions
left
concerning
them
he
writes
the
apologists
of
the
people
and
its
good
sense
speak
to
no
purpose
the
crowd
is
perhaps
the
union
of
worthy
folk
but
if
so
they
unite
only
on
their
bestial
and
contemptible
side
a
side
which
expresses
nothing
but
the
weakness
and
cruelty
of
human
nature
thus
he
does
not
address
himself
to
the
crowd
but
to
the
individual
conscience
of
each
man
each
child
of
the
people
for
there
light
is
to
be
found
he
founded
schools
without
precisely
knowing
what
he
would
teach
in
order
to
learn
he
undertook
another
journey
abroad
which
lasted
from
the
of
july
to
the
of
april
he
studied
the
various
pedagogic
systems
of
the
time
need
we
say
that
he
rejected
one
and
all
two
visits
to
marseilles
taught
him
that
the
true
education
of
the
people
is
effected
outside
the
schools
which
he
considered
absurd
by
means
of
the
journals
the
museums
the
libraries
the
street
and
everyday
life
which
he
termed
the
spontaneous
school
the
spontaneous
school
in
opposition
to
the
obligatory
school
which
he
considered
silly
and
harmful
this
was
what
he
wished
and
attempted
to
institute
upon
his
return
to
yasnaya
polyana
liberty
was
his
principle
he
would
not
admit
that
an
elect
class
the
privileged
liberal
circle
should
impose
its
knowledge
and
its
errors
upon
the
people
to
whom
it
is
a
stranger
it
had
no
right
to
do
so
this
method
of
forced
education
had
never
succeeded
in
producing
at
the
university
the
men
of
whom
humanity
has
need
but
men
of
whom
a
depraved
society
has
need
officials
official
professors
official
literary
men
or
men
torn
aimlessly
from
their
old
surroundings
whose
youth
has
been
spoiled
and
wasted
and
who
can
find
no
plan
in
life
irritable
puny
liberals
go
to
the
people
to
learn
what
they
want
i
if
they
do
not
value
the
art
of
reading
and
writing
which
the
intellectuals
force
upon
them
they
have
their
reasons
for
that
they
have
other
spiritual
needs
more
pressing
and
more
legitimate
try
to
understand
those
needs
and
help
them
to
satisfy
them
these
theories
those
of
a
revolutionary
conservative
as
tolstoy
always
was
he
attempted
to
put
into
practice
at
yasnaya
where
he
was
rather
the
than
the
master
of
his
pupils
at
the
same
time
he
endeavoured
to
introduce
a
new
human
spirit
into
agricultural
exploitation
appointed
in
territorial
arbitrator
for
the
district
of
krapiona
he
was
the
people
champion
against
the
abuses
of
power
on
the
part
of
the
landowners
and
the
state
we
must
not
suppose
that
this
social
activity
satisfied
him
or
entirely
filled
his
life
he
continued
to
be
the
prey
of
contending
passions
although
he
had
suffered
from
the
world
he
always
loved
it
and
felt
the
need
of
it
pleasure
resumed
him
at
intervals
or
else
the
love
of
action
he
would
risk
his
life
in
hunting
the
bear
he
played
for
heavy
stakes
he
would
even
fall
under
the
influence
of
the
literary
circles
of
petersburg
for
which
he
felt
such
contempt
after
these
aberrations
came
crises
of
disgust
such
of
his
writings
as
belong
to
this
period
bear
unfortunate
traces
of
this
artistic
and
moral
uncertainty
two
has
a
quality
of
pretentiousness
and
elegance
a
snobbish
worldly
flavour
which
shocks
one
as
coming
from
tolstoy
written
at
dijon
in
is
weak
and
eccentric
with
no
trace
of
the
writer
habitual
depth
or
precision
the
of
a
a
more
striking
though
hasty
piece
of
work
seems
to
betray
the
disillusionment
which
tolstoy
inspired
in
himself
prince
nekhludov
his
his
double
kills
himself
in
a
he
had
everything
wealth
a
name
intellect
and
high
ambitions
he
had
committed
no
crime
but
he
had
done
still
worse
he
had
killed
his
courage
his
youth
he
was
lost
without
even
the
excuse
of
a
violent
passion
merely
from
a
lack
of
will
the
approach
of
death
itself
does
not
alter
him
the
same
strange
inconsequence
the
same
hesitation
the
same
frivolity
of
thought
death
at
this
period
it
began
to
haunt
his
mind
already
foreshadowed
the
gloomy
analysis
of
death
of
ivan
ilyitch
the
solitude
of
the
dying
man
his
hatred
of
the
living
his
desperate
query
why
the
triptych
of
the
three
deaths
that
of
the
wealthy
woman
that
of
the
old
consumptive
postilion
and
that
of
the
slaughtered
dog
is
not
without
majesty
the
portraits
are
well
drawn
the
images
are
striking
although
the
whole
work
which
has
been
too
highly
praised
is
somewhat
loosely
constructed
while
the
death
of
the
dog
lacks
the
poetic
precision
to
be
found
in
the
beautiful
landscapes
taking
it
as
a
whole
we
hardly
know
how
far
it
is
intended
as
a
work
of
art
for
the
sake
of
art
or
whether
it
has
a
moral
intention
tolstoy
himself
did
not
know
on
the
of
february
when
he
read
his
essay
of
admittance
before
the
society
of
amateurs
of
russian
he
chose
for
his
subject
the
defence
of
art
for
art
sake
it
was
the
president
of
the
society
khomiakov
who
after
saluting
in
tolstoy
the
representative
of
purely
artistic
literature
took
up
the
defence
of
social
and
moral
art
a
year
later
the
death
of
his
brother
nikolas
who
succumbed
to
phthisis
at
hyères
on
the
of
september
completely
overcame
tolstoy
shook
him
to
the
point
of
crushing
his
faith
in
goodness
in
everything
and
made
him
deny
even
his
art
truth
is
horrible
doubless
so
long
as
the
desire
to
know
and
to
speak
the
truth
exists
men
will
try
to
know
and
to
speak
it
this
is
the
only
remnant
left
me
of
my
moral
concepts
it
is
the
only
thing
i
shall
do
but
not
in
the
form
of
art
your
art
art
is
a
lie
and
i
can
no
longer
love
a
beautiful
lie
less
than
six
months
later
however
he
returned
to
the
beautiful
lie
with
which
of
all
his
works
is
perhaps
most
devoid
of
moral
intention
if
we
except
the
latent
malediction
upon
money
and
its
powers
for
evil
a
work
written
purely
for
art
sake
a
masterpiece
moreover
whose
only
flaws
are
a
possibly
excessive
wealth
of
observation
an
abundance
of
material
which
would
have
sufficed
for
a
great
novel
and
the
contrast
which
is
too
severe
a
little
too
cruel
between
the
humorous
opening
and
the
atrocious
climax

it
is
one
which

there
was
no

and
an
asylum
full
of
lunatics
even
at
the
time
i
vaguely
suspected
as
much
but
as
all

do
i
regarded
them
as
all
mad
excepting
of

during
his

he
made
the
acquaintance
of

who
had
been
the
first
to
inspire
him
with
the
idea
of
educating
the
people
at

he
met

who
seems
to
have
made
a
great
impression
upon
him
especially

tolstoy
explained
these
principles
in
the
review

on
superiority
of
the
artistic
element
in
literature
over
all
its
contemporary
he
cited
against
tolstoy
his
own
examples
including
the
old
postilion
in
three
we
may
remark
that
another
brother
dmitri
had
already
died
of
the
same
disease
in
tolstoy
himself
believed
that
he
was
attacked
by
it
in
in
and
in
he
was
as
he
writes
the
of
october
of
a
strong
constitution
but
feeble
in
health
he
constantly
suffered
from
chills
sore
throats
toothache
inflamed
eyes
and
rheumatism
in
the
caucasus
in
he
had
two
days
in
the
week
at
least
to
keep
his
room
illness
stopped
him
for
several
months
in
on
the
road
from
silistria
to
sebastopol
in
at
yasnaya
he
was
seriously
ill
with
an
affection
of
the
lungs
in
the
fear
of
phthisis
induced
him
to
undergo
a
cure
at
samara
where
he
lived
with
the
bachkirs
and
after
he
returned
thither
almost
yearly
his
correspondence
with
fet
is
full
of
preoccupations
concerning
his
health
this
physical
condition
enables
one
the
better
to
understand
his
obsession
by
the
thought
of
death
in
later
years
he
spoke
of
this
illness
as
of
his
best
friend
when
one
is
ill
one
seems
to
descend
a
very
gentle
slope
which
at
a
certain
point
is
barred
by
a
curtain
a
light
curtain
of
some
filmy
stuff
on
the
hither
side
is
life
beyond
is
death
how
far
superior
is
the
state
of
illness
in
moral
value
to
that
of
health
do
not
speak
to
me
of
those
people
who
have
never
been
ill
they
are
terrible
the
women
especially
so
a
woman
who
has
never
known
illness
is
an
absolute
wild
beast

another

is
a
simple
narrative
of
a
the
which
evokes
personal
memories
and
is
full
of
the
beauty
of
poetic
and
impressions
tolstoy
used
almost
the
same
background
later
in
his
and
chapter
vii
family
happiness
from
this
period
of
transition
during
which
the
genius
of
the
man
was
feeling
its
way
blindly
doubtful
of
itself
and
apparently
exhausted
devoid
of
strong
passion
without
a
directing
will
like
nekhludov
in
the
of
a
from
this
period
issued
a
work
unique
in
its
tenderness
and
charm
this
was
the
miracle
of
love
for
many
years
tolstoy
had
been
on
friendly
terms
with
the
bers
family
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
the
mother
and
the
three
daughters
in
succession
his
final
choice
fell
upon
the
second
but
he
dared
not
confess
it
sophie
andreyevna
bers
was
still
a
child
she
was
seventeen
years
old
while
tolstoy
was
over
thirty
he
regarded
himself
as
an
old
man
who
had
not
the
right
to
associate
his
soiled
and
vitiated
life
with
that
of
an
innocent
young
girl
he
held
out
for
three
years
afterwards
in
karenin
he
related
how
his
declaration
to
sophie
bers
was
effected
and
how
she
replied
to
it
both
of
them
tracing
with
one
finger
under
a
table
the
initials
of
words
they
dared
not
say
like
levine
in
he
was
so
cruelly
honest
as
to
place
his
intimate
journal
in
the
hands
of
his
betrothed
in
order
that
she
should
be
unaware
of
none
of
his
past
transgressions
and
sophie
like
kitty
in
was
bitterly
hurt
by
its
perusal
they
were
married
on
the
of
september
in
the
artist
imagination
this
marriage
was
consummated
three
years
earlier
when
was
written
for
these
years
he
had
been
living
in
the
future
through
the
ineffable
days
of
love
that
does
not
as
yet
know
itself
through
the
delirious
days
of
love
that
has
attained
and
the
hour
in
which
the
divine
anticipated
words
are
whispered
when
the
tears
arise
of
a
happiness
which
departs
for
ever
and
will
never
return
again
and
the
triumphant
reality
of
the
early
days
of
marriage
the
egoism
of
lovers
the
incessant
causeless
joy
then
the
approaching
weariness
the
vague
discontent
the
boredom
of
a
monotonous
life
the
two
souls
which
softly
disengage
themselves
and
grow
further
and
further
away
from
one
another
the
dangerous
attraction
of
the
world
for
the
young
wife
flirtations
jealousies
fatal
misunderstandings
love
dissimulated
love
lost
and
at
length
the
sad
and
tender
autumn
of
the
heart
the
face
of
love
which
reappears
paler
older
but
more
touching
by
reason
of
tears
and
the
marks
of
time
the
memory
of
troubles
the
regret
for
the
ill
things
done
and
the
years
that
are
lost
the
calm
of
the
evening
the
august
passage
from
love
to
friendship
and
the
romance
of
the
passion
of
maternity
all
that
was
to
come
all
this
tolstoy
had
dreamed
of
tasted
in
advance
and
in
order
to
live
through
those
days
more
vividly
he
lived
in
the
for
the
first
time
perhaps
the
only
time
in
all
his
writings
the
story
passes
in
the
heart
of
a
woman
and
is
told
by
her
and
with
what
exquisite
delicacy
what
spiritual
beauty
the
beauty
of
a
soul
withdrawn
behind
a
veil
of
the
truest
modesty
for
once
the
analysis
of
the
writer
is
deprived
of
its
cruder
lights
there
is
no
feverish
struggle
to
present
the
naked
truth
the
secrets
of
the
inward
life
are
divined
rather
than
spoken
the
art
and
the
heart
of
the
artist
are
both
touched
and
softened
there
is
a
harmonious
balance
of
thought
and
form
has
the
perfection
of
a
work
of
racine
marriage
whose
sweet
and
bitter
tolstoy
presented
with
so
limpid
a
profundity
was
to
be
his
salvation
he
was
tired
unwell
disgusted
with
himself
and
his
efforts
the
brilliant
success
which
had
crowned
his
earlier
works
had
given
way
to
the
absolute
silence
of
the
critics
and
the
indifference
of
the
public
he
pretended
haughtily
to
be
not
my
reputation
has
greatly
diminished
in
popularity
a
fact
which
was
saddening
me
now
i
am
content
i
know
that
i
have
to
say
something
and
that
i
have
the
power
to
speak
it
with
no
feeble
voice
as
for
the
public
let
it
think
what
it
will
but
he
was
boasting
he
himself
was
not
sure
of
his
art
certainly
he
was
the
master
of
his
literary
instrument
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
as
he
said
in
respect
of
it
was
a
matter
of
chattering
about
the
first
subject
that
came
to
hand
by
a
man
who
knows
how
to
hold
his
pen
his
social
work
was
abortive
in
he
resigned
his
appointment
as
territorial
arbitrator
the
same
year
the
police
made
a
search
at
yasnaya
polyana
turned
everything
and
closed
the
school
tolstoy
was
absent
at
the
time
suffering
from
overwork
fearing
that
he
was
attacked
by
phthisis
the
squabbles
of
arbitration
had
become
so
painful
to
me
the
work
of
the
school
so
vague
and
the
doubts
which
arose
from
the
desire
of
teaching
others
while
hiding
my
own
ignorance
of
what
had
to
be
taught
were
so
disheartening
that
i
fell
perhaps
i
should
then
have
fallen
into
the
state
of
despair
to
which
i
was
to
succumb
fifteen
years
later
had
there
not
remained
to
me
an
unknown
aspect
of
life
which
promised
salvation
the
life
of
the
family
when
a
child
he
had
in
a
fit
of
jealousy
pushed
from
a
balcony
the
little
girl
then
aged
nine
who
afterwards
became
madame
bers
with
the
result
that
she
was
lame
for
several
years
see
in
happiness
the
declaration
of
sergius
suppose
there
were
a
a
an
elderly
man
who
had
lived
his
life
and
a
lady
b
young
and
happy
who
as
yet
knew
neither
men
nor
life
as
the
result
of
various
domestic
happenings
he
came
to
love
her
as
a
daughter
and
was
not
aware
that
he
could
love
her
in
another
way
perhaps
this
novel
contained
the
memories
also
of
a
romantic
love
affair
which
commenced
in
in
moscow
the
second
party
to
which
was
a
young
girl
very
different
to
himself
very
worldly
and
frivolous
from
whom
he
finally
parted
although
they
were
sincerely
attached
to
one
another
from
to
october
letter
to
fet
et
chapter
viii
marriage
at
first
he
rejoiced
in
the
new
life
with
the
passion
which
he
brought
to
everything
the
personal
influence
of
countess
tolstoy
was
a
godsend
to
his
art
greatly
gifted
in
a
literary
sense
she
was
as
she
says
a
true
author
wife
so
keenly
did
she
take
her
work
to
heart
she
worked
with
him
worked
to
his
dictation
his
rough
drafts
she
sought
to
protect
him
from
his
religious
dæmon
that
formidable
genie
which
was
already
at
moments
whispering
words
that
meant
the
death
of
art
she
tried
to
shut
the
door
upon
all
social
utopias
she
requickened
her
husband
creative
genius
she
did
more
she
brought
as
an
offering
to
that
genius
the
wealth
of
a
fresh
feminine
temperament
with
the
exception
of
the
charming
silhouettes
in
and
there
are
few
women
in
the
earlier
works
of
tolstoy
or
they
remain
of
secondary
importance
woman
appears
in
happiness
written
under
the
influence
of
his
love
for
sophie
bers
in
the
works
which
follow
there
are
numerous
types
of
young
girls
and
women
full
of
intensest
life
and
even
superior
to
the
male
types
one
likes
to
think
not
only
that
countess
tolstoy
served
her
husband
as
the
model
for
natasha
in
and
and
for
kitty
in
but
that
she
was
enabled
by
means
of
her
confidences
and
her
own
vision
to
become
his
discreet
and
valuable
collaborator
certain
pages
of
in
particular
seem
to
me
to
reveal
a
woman
touch
thanks
to
the
advantages
of
this
union
tolstoy
enjoyed
for
a
space
of
twelve
or
fourteen
years
a
peace
and
security
which
had
been
long
unknown
to
him
he
was
able
sheltered
by
love
to
dream
and
to
realise
at
leisure
the
masterpieces
of
his
brain
the
colossal
monuments
which
dominate
the
fiction
of
the
nineteenth
war
and
and
and
is
the
vastest
epic
of
our
times
a
modern
a
world
of
faces
and
of
passions
moves
within
it
over
this
human
ocean
of
innumerable
waves
broods
a
sovereign
mind
which
serenely
raises
or
stills
the
tempest
more
than
once
in
the
past
while
contemplating
this
work
i
was
reminded
of
homer
and
of
goethe
in
spite
of
the
vastly
different
spirit
and
period
of
the
work
since
then
i
have
discovered
that
at
the
period
of
writing
these
books
tolstoy
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
nourishing
his
mind
upon
homer
and
goethe
moreover
in
the
notes
dated
in
which
he
classifies
the
various
departments
of
letters
he
mentions
as
belonging
to
the
same
family
odyssey
iliad
the
natural
development
of
his
mind
led
him
from
the
romance
of
individual
destinies
to
the
romance
of
armies
and
peoples
those
vast
human
hordes
in
which
the
wills
of
millions
of
beings
are
dissolved
his
tragic
experiences
at
the
siege
of
sebastopol
helped
him
to
comprehend
the
soul
of
the
russian
nation
and
its
daily
life
according
to
his
first
intentions
the
gigantic
and
was
to
be
merely
the
central
panel
of
a
series
of
epic
frescoes
in
which
the
poem
of
russia
should
be
developed
from
peter
the
great
to
the
decembrists
and
in
june
he
notes
in
his
diary
i
am
reading
goethe
and
many
ideas
are
coming
to
life
within
me
in
the
spring
of
tolstoy
was
goethe
and
wrote
of
as
the
poetry
of
the
world
of
thought
the
poetry
which
expresses
that
which
can
be
expressed
by
no
other
art
later
he
sacrificed
goethe
as
he
did
shakespeare
to
his
god
but
he
remained
faithful
in
his
admiration
of
homer
in
august
he
was
reading
with
equal
zest
the
and
the
bible
in
one
of
his
latest
works
the
pamphlet
attacking
shakespeare
it
is
homer
that
he
opposes
to
shakespeare
as
an
example
of
sincerity
balance
and
true
art
to
be
truly
sensible
of
the
power
of
this
work
we
must
take
into
account
its
hidden
unity
too
many
readers
unable
to
see
it
in
perspective
perceive
in
it
nothing
but
thousands
of
details
whose
profusion
amazes
and
distracts
them
they
are
lost
in
this
forest
of
life
the
reader
must
stand
aloof
upon
a
height
he
must
attain
the
view
of
the
unobstructed
horizon
the
vast
circle
of
forest
and
meadow
then
he
will
catch
the
homeric
spirit
of
the
work
the
calm
of
eternal
laws
the
awful
rhythm
of
the
breathing
of
destiny
the
sense
of
the
whole
of
which
every
detail
makes
a
part
and
the
genius
of
the
artist
supreme
over
the
whole
like
the
god
of
genesis
who
broods
upon
the
face
of
the
waters
in
the
beginning
the
calm
of
the
ocean
peace
and
the
life
of
russia
before
the
war
the
first
hundred
pages
reflect
with
an
impassive
precision
a
detached
irony
the
yawning
emptiness
of
worldly
minds
only
towards
the
hundredth
page
do
we
hear
the
cry
of
one
of
these
living
dead
the
worst
among
them
prince
basil
we
commit
sins
we
deceive
one
another
and
why
do
we
do
it
all
my
friend
i
am
more
than
sixty
years
old
all
ends
in
death
death
what
horror
among
these
idle
insipid
untruthful
souls
capable
of
every
aberration
of
every
crime
certain
saner
natures
are
prominent
genuine
natures
by
their
clumsy
candour
like
pierre
besoukhov
by
their
deeply
rooted
independence
their
old
russian
peculiarities
like
marie
dmitrievna
by
the
freshness
of
their
youth
like
the
little
rostoffs
natures
full
of
goodness
and
resignation
like
the
princess
marie
and
those
who
like
prince
andrei
are
not
good
but
proud
and
are
tormented
by
an
unhealthy
existence
now
comes
the
first
muttering
of
the
waves
the
russian
army
is
in
austria
fatality
is
supreme
nowhere
more
visibly
imperious
than
in
the
loosing
of
elementary
forces
in
the
war
the
true
leaders
are
those
who
do
not
seek
to
lead
or
direct
but
like
kutuzov
or
bagration
to
allow
it
to
be
believed
that
their
personal
intentions
are
in
perfect
agreement
with
what
is
really
the
simple
result
of
the
force
of
circumstances
the
will
of
subordinates
and
the
caprices
of
chance
the
advantage
of
surrendering
to
the
hand
of
destiny
the
happiness
of
simple
action
a
sane
and
normal
state
the
troubled
spirits
regain
their
poise
prince
andrei
breathes
begins
to
live
and
while
in
the
far
distance
remote
from
the
lifegiving
breath
of
the
holy
tempest
pierre
and
the
princess
marie
are
threatened
by
the
contagion
of
their
world
and
the
deception
of
love
andrei
wounded
at
austerlitz
has
suddenly
amid
the
intoxication
of
action
brutally
interrupted
the
revelation
of
the
serene
immensity
of
the
universe
lying
on
his
back
he
sees
nothing
now
except
very
far
above
him
a
sky
infinitely
deep
wherein
light
greyish
clouds
go
softly
wandering
what
peacefulness
how
calm
he
was
saying
to
himself
it
was
not
like
this
when
i
was
running
by
and
shouting
how
was
it
i
did
not
notice
it
before
this
illimitable
depth
how
happy
i
am
to
have
found
it
at
last
yes
all
is
emptiness
all
is
deception
except
this
and
god
be
praised
for
this
calm
but
life
resumes
him
and
again
the
wave
falls
left
once
more
to
themselves
in
the
demoralising
atmosphere
of
cities
the
restless
discouraged
souls
wander
blindly
in
the
darkness
sometimes
through
the
poisoned
atmosphere
of
the
world
sweep
the
intoxicating
maddening
odours
of
nature
love
and
springtime
the
blind
forces
which
draw
together
prince
andrei
and
the
charming
natasha
to
throw
her
a
moment
later
into
the
arms
of
the
first
seducer
to
hand
so
much
poetry
so
much
tenderness
so
much
purity
of
heart
tarnished
by
the
world
and
always
the
wide
sky
which
broods
above
the
outrage
and
abjectness
of
the
earth
but
man
does
not
see
it
even
andrei
has
forgotten
the
light
of
austerlitz
for
him
the
sky
is
now
only
a
dark
heavy
vault
which
covers
the
face
of
emptiness
it
is
time
for
the
hurricane
of
war
to
burst
once
more
upon
these
vitiated
minds
the
fatherland
russia
is
invaded
then
comes
the
day
of
borodino
with
its
solemn
majesty
enmities
are
effaced
dologhov
embraces
his
enemy
pierre
andrei
wounded
weeps
for
pity
and
compassion
over
the
misery
of
the
man
whom
he
most
hated
anatol
kuraguin
his
neighbour
in
the
ambulance
the
unity
of
hearts
is
accomplished
unity
in
passionate
sacrifice
to
the
country
and
submission
to
the
divine
laws
to
accept
the
frightful
necessity
of
war
seriously
and
austerely
to
human
liberty
war
is
the
most
painful
act
of
submission
to
the
divine
laws
simplicity
of
heart
consists
in
submission
to
the
will
of
god
the
soul
of
the
russian
people
and
its
submission
to
destiny
are
incarnated
in
the
person
of
the
kutuzov
this
old
man
who
has
no
passions
left
but
only
experience
the
result
of
the
passions
and
in
whom
intelligence
which
is
intended
to
group
together
facts
and
to
draw
from
them
conclusions
is
replaced
by
a
philosophical
contemplation
of
events
devises
nothing
and
undertakes
nothing
but
he
listens
to
and
remembers
everything
he
knows
how
to
profit
by
it
at
the
right
moment
he
will
hinder
nothing
that
is
of
use
he
will
permit
nothing
harmful
he
sees
on
the
faces
of
his
troops
that
inexpressible
force
which
is
known
as
the
will
to
conquer
it
is
latent
victory
he
admits
something
more
powerful
than
his
own
will
the
inevitable
march
of
the
facts
which
pass
before
his
eyes
he
sees
them
he
follows
them
and
he
is
able
mentally
to
stand
aloof
in
short
he
has
the
heart
of
a
russian
this
fatalism
of
the
russian
people
calmly
heroic
is
personified
also
in
the
poor
moujik
platon
karatayev
simple
pious
and
resigned
with
his
kindly
patient
smile
in
suffering
and
in
death
through
suffering
and
experience
above
the
ruins
of
their
country
after
the
horrors
of
its
agony
pierre
and
andrei
the
two
heroes
of
the
book
attain
through
love
and
faith
to
the
moral
deliverance
and
the
mystic
joy
by
which
they
behold
god
living
tolstoy
does
not
stop
here
the
epilogue
of
which
the
action
passes
in
deals
with
the
transition
from
one
age
to
another
from
one
napoleonic
era
to
the
era
of
the
decembrists
it
produces
an
impression
of
continuity
and
of
the
resumption
of
life
instead
of
commencing
and
ending
in
the
midst
of
a
crisis
tolstoy
finishes
as
he
began
at
the
moment
when
a
great
wave
has
spent
itself
while
that
following
it
is
gathering
itself
together
already
we
obtain
a
glimpse
of
the
heroes
to
be
of
the
conflicts
which
will
ensue
between
them
and
of
the
dead
who
are
born
again
in
the
living
i
have
tried
to
indicate
the
broad
lines
of
the
romance
for
few
readers
take
the
trouble
to
look
for
them
but
what
words
are
adequate
to
describe
the
extraordinary
vitality
of
these
hundreds
of
heroes
all
distinct
individuals
all
drawn
with
unforgettable
mastery
soldiers
peasants
great
nobles
russians
austrians
frenchmen
not
a
line
savours
of
improvisation
for
this
gallery
of
portraits
unexampled
in
european
literature
tolstoy
made
sketches
without
number
combined
as
he
says
millions
of
projects
buried
himself
in
libraries
laid
under
contribution
his
family
archives
his
previous
notes
his
personal
memories
this
meticulous
preparation
ensured
the
solidity
of
the
work
but
did
not
damp
his
spontaneity
tolstoy
worked
with
enthusiasm
with
an
eagerness
and
a
delight
which
communicate
themselves
to
the
reader
above
all
the
great
charm
of
and
resides
in
its
spirit
of
youth
no
other
work
of
tolstoy
presents
in
such
abundance
the
soul
of
childhood
and
of
youth
and
each
youthful
spirit
is
a
strain
of
music
pure
as
a
spring
full
of
a
touching
and
penetrating
grace
like
a
melody
of
mozart
of
such
are
the
young
nikolas
rostoff
sonia
and
poor
little
petia
most
exquisite
of
all
is
natasha
dear
little
girl
fantastic
full
of
laughter
her
heart
full
of
affection
we
see
her
grow
up
before
us
we
follow
her
through
life
with
the
tenderness
one
would
feel
for
a
sister
who
that
has
read
of
her
does
not
feel
that
he
has
known
her
that
wonderful
night
of
spring
when
natasha
at
her
window
flooded
with
the
moonlight
dreams
and
speaks
wildly
above
the
window
of
the
listening
andrei
the
emotions
of
the
first
ball
the
expectation
of
love
the
burgeoning
of
riotous
dreams
and
desires
the
the
night
in
the
forest
full
of
fantastic
lights
nature
and
the
embrace
of
her
vague
tenderness
the
evening
at
the
opera
the
unfamiliar
world
of
art
in
which
reason
grows
confused
the
folly
of
the
heart
and
the
folly
of
the
body
yearning
for
love
the
misery
that
floods
the
soul
the
divine
pity
which
watches
over
the
dying
lover
one
can
not
evoke
these
pitiful
memories
without
emotion
such
emotion
as
one
would
feel
in
speaking
of
a
dear
and
beloved
woman
how
such
a
creation
shows
the
weakness
of
the
female
types
in
almost
the
whole
of
contemporary
drama
and
fiction
life
itself
has
been
captured
life
so
fluid
so
supple
that
we
seem
to
see
it
throbbing
and
changing
from
one
line
to
another
princess
marie
the
ugly
woman
whose
goodness
makes
her
beautiful
is
no
less
perfect
a
portrait
but
how
the
timid
awkward
girl
would
have
blushed
how
those
who
resemble
her
must
blush
at
finding
unveiled
all
the
secrets
of
a
heart
which
hides
itself
so
fearfully
from
every
glance
in
general
the
portraits
of
women
are
as
i
have
said
very
much
finer
than
the
male
characters
in
especial
than
those
of
the
two
heroes
to
whom
tolstoy
has
given
his
own
ideas
the
weak
pliable
nature
of
pierre
besoukhov
and
the
hard
eager
nature
of
prince
andrie
bolkonsky
these
are
characters
which
lack
a
centre
of
gravity
they
oscillate
perpetually
rather
than
evolve
they
run
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
yet
never
advance
one
may
of
course
reply
that
in
this
they
are
thoroughly
russian
i
find
however
that
russians
have
criticised
them
in
similar
terms
tourgenev
doubtless
had
them
in
mind
when
he
complained
that
tolstoy
psychology
was
a
stationary
matter
no
real
development
eternal
hesitations
oscillations
of
feeling
tolstoy
himself
admitted
that
he
had
at
times
rather
sacrificed
the
individual
character
to
the
historical
design
it
is
true
in
fact
that
the
glory
of
and
resides
in
the
resurrection
of
a
complete
historical
period
with
its
national
migrations
its
warfare
of
peoples
its
true
heroes
are
these
peoples
and
behind
them
as
behind
the
heroes
of
homer
the
gods
who
lead
them
the
forces
invisible
infinitely
small
which
direct
the
masses
the
breath
of
the
infinite
these
gigantic
conflicts
in
which
a
hidden
destiny
hurls
the
blind
nations
together
have
a
mythical
grandeur
our
thoughts
go
beyond
the
we
are
reminded
of
the
hindu
epics
domestic
happiness
completely
absorbs
me
january
i
am
so
happy
so
happy
i
love
her
so
february
see
et
she
had
written
several
novels
it
is
said
that
she
copied
and
seven
times
directly
after
his
marriage
tolstoy
suspended
his
work
of
teaching
his
review
and
his
school
her
sister
tatiana
intelligent
and
artistic
whose
wit
and
musical
talent
were
greatly
admired
by
tolstoy
also
served
him
as
a
model
tolstoy
used
to
say
i
took
tania
tatiana
i
beat
her
up
with
sonia
sophie
bers
countess
tolstoy
and
out
came
natasha
cited
by
birukov
the
installation
of
dolly
in
the
country
house
dolly
and
the
children
a
number
of
details
of
dress
and
toilet
without
speaking
of
certain
secrets
of
the
feminine
mind
which
even
the
intuition
of
a
man
of
genius
might
perhaps
have
failed
to
penetrate
if
a
woman
had
not
betrayed
them
to
him
here
is
a
characteristic
instance
of
tolstoy
enslavement
by
his
creative
genius
his
is
interrupted
for
thirteen
years
from
november
when
the
composition
of
and
was
in
full
swing
the
egoism
of
the
artist
has
silenced
the
monologue
of
the
this
period
of
creation
was
also
a
period
of
robust
physical
life
tolstoy
was
mad
on
hunting
hunting
i
forget
everything

on

he
broke
his

it
was
during
his
convalescence
that
the
first
portions
of

were
on
recovering
consciousness

fainting

letter
to
fet
january
all
the
letters
written
at
this
time
to
fet
are
full
of
an
exulting
joy
of
creation
i
regard
all
that
i
have
hitherto
published
he
says
as
merely
a
trial
of
my
pen
before
this
date
tolstoy
had
noted
among
the
books
which
influenced
him
between
the
ages
of
twenty
and
goethe
and
very
great
influence
homer
and
in
russian
very
great
influence
the
two
first
parts
of
and
appeared
in
under
the
title
year
tolstoy
commenced
this
work
in
by
of
which
he
wrote
three
fragments
but
he
saw
that
the
foundations
of
his
plan
were
not
sufficiently
assured
and
going
further
back
to
the
period
of
the
napoleonic
wars
he
wrote
and
publication
was
commenced
in
the
of
january
the
sixth
volume
was
completed
in
the
autumn
of
then
tolstoy
ascended
the
stream
of
history
and
he
conceived
the
plan
of
an
epic
romance
dealing
with
peter
the
great
then
of
another
dealing
with
the
rule
of
the
empresses
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
their
favourites
he
worked
at
it
from
to
surrounded
with
documents
and
writing
the
first
drafts
of
various
portions
but
his
realistic
scruples
made
him
renounce
the
project
he
was
conscious
that
he
could
never
succeed
in
resuscitating
the
spirit
of
those
distant
periods
in
a
sufficiently
truthful
fashion
later
in
january
he
conceived
the
idea
of
another
romance
of
the
period
of
nikolas
then
he
eagerly
returned
to
the
collecting
the
evidence
of
survivors
and
visiting
the
scenes
of
the
action
in
he
wrote
to
his
aunt
countess
a
tolstoy
this
work
is
so
important
to
me
you
can
not
imagine
how
much
it
means
to
me
it
is
as
much
to
me
as
your
faith
is
to
you
i
would
say
even
more
but
in
proportion
as
he
plumbed
the
subject
he
grew
away
from
it
his
heart
was
in
it
no
longer
as
early
as
april
he
wrote
to
fet
if
i
were
thinking
of
it
if
i
were
to
write
it
i
should
flatter
myself
with
the
hope
that
the
very
atmosphere
of
my
mind
would
be
insupportable
to
those
who
fire
upon
men
for
the
good
of
humanity
at
this
period
of
his
life
the
religious
crisis
had
set
in
he
was
about
to
burn
his
ancient
idols
pierre
besoukhov
who
has
married
natasha
will
become
a
decembrist
he
has
founded
a
secret
society
to
watch
over
the
general
good
a
sort
of
natasha
associates
herself
with
his
plans
with
the
utmost
enthusiasm
denissov
can
not
conceive
of
a
pacific
revolution
but
is
quite
ready
for
an
armed
revolt
nikolas
rostoff
has
retained
his
blind
soldier
loyalty
he
who
said
before
austerlitz
we
have
only
one
thing
to
do
to
fight
and
never
to
think
is
angry
with
pierre
and
exclaims
my
oath
before
all
if
i
were
ordered
to

they
tell
me
i
will
do
it
yes
i
shall
do
it
would
have
been
pleased
with
me
and
the
book
ends
with
the
dream
of
a
child
who
sees
himself
in
the
guise
of
one
of
plutarch
heroes
with
his
uncle
pierre
by
his
side
preceded
by
glory
and
followed
by
an
if
the
had
been
written
then
little
bolkonsky
would
doubtless
have
been
one
of
its
heroes
i
have
remarked
that
the
two
families
rostoff
and
bolkonsky
in
and
peace
recall
the
families
of
tolstoy
father
and
mother
by
many
characteristics
again
in
the
novels
of
the
caucasus
and
sebastopol
there
are
many
of
the
types
of
soldiers
officers
and
men
which
appear
in
and
letter
of
february
cited
by
birukov
notably
he
said
that
of
prince
andrei
in
the
first
part
chapter
ix
anna
karenin
karenin
with
and
peace
marks
the
climax
of
this
period
of
maturity
is
the
more
perfect
work
the
work
of
a
mind
more
certain
of
its
artistic
creation
richer
too
in
experience
a
mind
for
which
the
world
of
the
heart
holds
no
more
secrets
but
it
lacks
the
fire
of
youth
the
freshness
of
enthusiasm
the
mighty
pinions
of
and
already
tolstoy
has
lost
something
of
the
joy
of
creation
the
temporary
peace
of
the
first
months
of
marriage
has
flown
into
the
enchanted
circle
of
love
and
art
which
countess
tolstoy
had
drawn
about
him
moral
scruples
begin
to
intrude
even
in
the
early
chapters
of
and
peace
written
one
year
after
marriage
the
confidences
of
prince
andrei
to
pierre
upon
the
subject
of
marriage
denote
the
disenchantment
of
the
man
who
sees
in
the
beloved
woman
the
stranger
the
innocent
enemy
the
involuntary
obstacle
to
his
moral
development
some
letters
of
announce
the
coming
return
of
religious
troubles
as
yet
they
are
only
passing
threats
blotting
out
the
joy
of
life
but
during
the
months
of
when
tolstoy
was
finishing
and
peace
there
fell
a
more
serious
blow
he
had
left
his
home
for
a
few
days
to
visit
a
distant
estate
one
night
he
was
lying
in
bed
it
had
just
struck
two
i
was
dreadfully
tired
i
was
sleepy
and
felt
comfortable
enough
all
of
a
sudden
i
was
seized
by
such
anguish
such
terror
as
i
had
never
felt
in
all
my
life
i
will
tell
you
about
it
in
detail
it
was
truly
frightful
i
leapt
from
the
bed
and
told
them
to
get
the
horses
ready
while
they
were
putting
them
in
i
fell
asleep
and
when
i
woke
again
i
was
completely
recovered
yesterday
the
same
thing
happened
but
in
a
much
less
degree
the
palace
of
illusion
so
laboriously
raised
by
the
love
of
the
wife
was
tottering
in
the
spiritual
blank
which
followed
the
achievement
of
and
the
artist
was
recaptured
by
his
philosophical
and
educational
preoccupations
he
wished
to
write
a
for
the
people
he
worked
at
it
feverishly
for
four
years
he
was
prouder
of
it
than
of
and
and
when
it
was
finished
he
wrote
a
second
then
he
conceived
a
passion
for
greek
he
studied
latin
from
morning
to
night
he
abandoned
all
other
work
he
discovered
the
delightful
xenophon
and
homer
the
real
homer
not
the
homer
of
the
translators
all
these
joukhovskys
and
vosses
who
sing
with
any
sort
of
voice
they
can
manage
to
produce
guttural
peevish
mawkish
but
this
other
devil
who
sings
at
the
top
of
his
voice
without
it
ever
entering
his
head
that
any
one
may
be
listening
without
a
knowledge
of
greek
no
education
i
am
convinced
that
until
now
i
knew
nothing
of
all
that
is
truly
beautiful
and
of
a
simple
beauty
in
human
speech
this
is
folly
and
he
admits
as
much
he
goes
to
school
again
with
such
passionate
enthusiasm
that
he
falls
ill
in
he
was
forced
to
go
to
samara
to
undergo
the
cure
staying
with
the
bachkirs
nothing
pleased
him
but
his
greek
at
the
end
of
a
lawsuit
in
he
spoke
seriously
of
selling
all
that
he
possessed
in
russia
and
of
settling
in
england
countess
tolstoy
was
in
despair
if
you
are
always
absorbed
in
your
greeks
you
will
never
get
well
it
is
they
who
have
caused
this
suffering
and
this
indifference
concerning
your
present
life
it
is
not
in
vain
that
we
call
greek
a
dead
language
it
produces
a
condition
of
death
in
the
spirit
finally
to
the
great
joy
of
the
countess
after
many
plans
abandoned
before
they
were
fairly
commenced
on
march
he
began
to
write
karenin
while
he
worked
at
it
his
life
i
was
saddened
by
domestic
sorrow
his
wife
was
happiness
does
not
reign
in
the
house
he
writes
to
fet
in
to
some
extent
the
work
bears
traces
of
these
depressing
experiences
and
of
passions
disillusioned
save
in
the
charming
passages
dealing
with
the
betrothal
of
levine
love
is
no
longer
presented
with
the
spirit
of
youth
and
poetry
which
places
certain
pages
of
and
on
a
level
with
the
most
beautiful
lyric
poetry
of
all
times
it
has
assumed
a
different
character
bitter
sensual
imperious
the
fatality
which
broods
over
the
romance
is
no
longer
as
in
and
a
kind
of
krishna
murderous
and
serene
the
destiny
of
empires
but
the
madness
of
love
venus
herself
she
it
is
in
the
wonderful
ball
scene
when
passion
seizes
upon
anna
and
vronsky
unawares
who
endows
the
innocent
beauty
of
anna
crowned
with
and
clothed
in
black
velvet
with
an
almost
infernal
seductiveness
she
it
is
who
when
vronsky
has
just
declared
his
love
throws
a
light
upon
anna
face
but
a
light
not
of
joy
it
was
the
terrible
glare
of
an
incendiary
fire
upon
a
gloomy
night
she
it
is
who
in
the
veins
of
this
loyal
and
reasonable
woman
this
young
affectionate
mother
pours
a
voluptuous
stream
as
of
irresistible
ichor
and
installs
herself
in
her
heart
never
to
leave
it
until
she
has
destroyed
it
no
one
can
approach
anna
without
feeling
the
attraction
and
the
terror
of
this
hidden
dæmon
kitty
is
the
first
to
discover
it
with
a
shock
of
bewilderment
a
mysterious
fear
mingles
with
the
delight
of
vronsky
when
he
goes
to
see
anna
levine
in
her
presence
loses
all
his
will
anna
herself
is
perfectly
well
aware
that
she
is
no
longer
her
own
mistress
as
the
story
develops
the
implacable
passion
consumes
little
by
little
the
whole
moral
structure
of
this
proud
woman
all
that
is
best
in
her
her
sincere
courageous
mind
crumbles
and
falls
she
has
no
longer
the
strength
to
sacrifice
her
worldly
vanity
her
life
has
no
other
object
than
to
please
her
lover
she
refuses
with
shame
and
terror
to
bear
children
jealousy
tortures
her
the
sensual
passion
which
enslaves
her
obliges
her
to
lie
with
her
gestures
her
voice
her
eyes
she
falls
to
the
level
of
those
women
who
no
longer
seek
anything
but
the
power
of
making
every
man
turn
to
look
after
them
she
uses
morphia
to
dull
her
sufferings
until
the
intolerable
torments
which
consume
her
overcome
her
with
the
bitter
sense
of
her
moral
downfall
and
cast
her
beneath
the
wheels
of
the
and
the
little
moujik
with
the
untidy
beard
the
sinister
vision
which
has
haunted
her
dreams
and
vronsky
leaned
over
the
track
from
the
platform
of
the
carriage
and
as
the
prophetic
dream
foretold
he
was
bent
double
over
a
sack
in
which
he
was
hiding
the
remains
of
something
which
had
known
life
with
its
torments
its
betrayals
and
its
sorrow
vengeance
is
mine
saith
the
lord
around
this
tragedy
of
a
soul
consumed
by
love
and
crushed
by
the
law
of
god
a
painting
in
a
single
shade
and
of
terrible
gloom
tolstoy
has
woven
as
in
and
peace
the
romances
of
other
lives
unfortunately
these
parallel
stories
alternate
in
a
somewhat
stiff
and
artificial
manner
without
achieving
the
organic
unity
of
the
symphony
of
and
it
may
also
be
said
that
the
perfect
realism
of
certain
of
the
pictures
the
aristocratic
circles
of
petersburg
and
their
idle
discourse
is
now
and
again
superfluous
and
unnecessary
finally
and
more
openly
than
in
and
tolstoy
has
presented
his
own
moral
character
and
his
philosophic
ideas
side
by
side
with
the
spectacle
of
life
none
the
less
the
work
is
of
a
marvellous
richness
there
is
the
same
profusion
of
types
as
in
and
peace
and
all
are
of
a
striking
justness
the
portraits
of
the
men
seem
to
me
even
superior
tolstoy
has
depicted
with
evident
delight
the
amiable
egoist
stepan
arcadievitch
whom
no
one
can
look
at
without
responding
to
his
affectionate
smile
and
karenin
the
perfect
type
of
the
high
official
the
distinguished
and
commonplace
with
his
mania
for
concealing
his
real
opinions
and
feelings
under
a
mask
of
perpetual
irony
a
mixture
of
dignity
and
cowardice
of
phariseeism
and
christian
feeling
a
strange
product
of
an
artificial
world
from
which
he
can
never
completely
free
himself
in
spite
of
his
intelligence
and
his
true
generosity
a
man
afraid
to
listen
to
his
i
own
heart
and
rightly
so
afraid
since
when
he
does
surrender
to
it
he
ends
by
falling
into
a
state
of
nonsensical
mysticism
but
the
principal
interest
of
the
romance
besides
the
tragedy
of
anna
and
the
varied
pictures
of
russian
society
towards
of
salons
officers
clubs
balls
theatres
races
lies
in
its
autobiographical
character
more
than
any
other
personage
of
tolstoy
books
constantine
levine
is
the
incarnation
of
the
writer
himself
not
only
has
tolstoy
attributed
to
him
his
own
ideas
at
one
and
the
same
time
conservative
and
democratic
and
the
of
the
provincial
aristocrat
who
despises
intellectuals
but
he
has
made
him
the
gift
of
part
of
his
own
life
the
love
of
levine
and
kitty
and
their
first
years
of
marriage
are
a
transposition
of
his
own
domestic
memories
just
as
the
death
of
levine
brother
is
a
melancholy
evocation
of
the
death
of
tolstoy
brother
dmitri
the
latter
portion
useless
to
the
romance
gives
us
an
insight
into
the
troubles
which
were
then
oppressing
the
author
while
the
epilogue
of
and
was
an
artistic
transition
to
another
projected
work
the
epilogue
to
is
an
autobiographical
transition
to
the
moral
revolution
which
two
years
later
was
to
find
expression
in
the
already
in
the
course
of
karenin
he
returns
again
and
again
to
a
violent
or
ironical
criticism
of
contemporary
society
which
he
never
ceased
to
attack
in
his
subsequent
works
war
is
declared
upon
deceit
war
upon
lies
upon
virtuous
as
well
as
vicious
lies
upon
liberal
chatter
fashionable
charity
religion
and
philanthropy
war
against
the
world
which
distorts
all
truthful
feelings
and
inevitably
crushes
the
generous
enthusiasm
of
the
mind
death
throws
an
unexpected
light
upon
the
social
conventions
before
anna
dying
the
stilted
karenin
is
softened
into
this
lifeless
soul
in
which
everything
is
artificial
shines
a
ray
of
love
and
of
christian
forgiveness
all
three
the
husband
the
wife
and
the
lover
are
momentarily
transformed
all
three
become
simple
and
loyal
but
as
anna
recovers
all
three
are
sensible
facing
the
almost
holy
moral
strength
which
was
guiding
them
from
within
the
existence
of
another
force
brutal
but
which
was
directing
their
lives
despite
themselves
and
which
would
not
leave
them
in
peace
and
they
knew
from
the
beginning
that
they
would
be
powerless
in
the
coming
struggle
in
which
they
would
be
obliged
to
do
the
evil
that
the
world
would
consider
necessary
if
levine
like
tolstoy
whose
incarnation
he
is
also
became
purified
in
the
epilogue
to
the
book
it
was
because
he
too
was
touched
by
mortality
previously
incapable
of
believing
he
was
equally
incapable
of
absolute
doubt
after
he
beheld
his
brother
die
the
terror
of
his
ignorance
possessed
him
for
a
time
this
misery
was
stifled
by
his
marriage
but
it
at
the
birth
of
his
firstborn
he
passed
alternately
through
crises
of
prayer
and
negation
he
read
the
philosophers
in
vain
he
began
in
his
distracted
state
to
fear
the
temptation
of
suicide
physical
work
was
a
solace
it
presented
no
doubts
all
was
clear
levine
conversed
with
the
peasants
one
of
them
spoke
of
the
men
who
live
not
for
self
but
for
god
this
was
to
him
an
illumination
he
saw
the
antagonism
between
the
reason
and
the
heart
reason
preached
the
ferocious
struggle
for
life
there
is
nothing
reasonable
in
loving
one
neighbour
reason
has
taught
me
nothing
all
that
i
know
has
been
given
to
me
revealed
to
me
by
the
heart
from
this
time
peace
returned
the
word
of
the
humble
peasant
whose
heart
was
his
only
guide
had
led
him
back
to
god
to
what
god
he
did
not
seek
to
know
his
attitude
toward
the
church
at
this
moment
as
was
tolstoy
for
a
long
period
was
humble
and
in
no
wise
defiant
of
her
dogmas
there
is
a
truth
even
in
the
illusion
of
the
celestial
vault
and
in
the
apparent
movement
of
the
stars
it
is
regrettable
that
the
beauty
of
the
poetical
conception
of
the
work
is
often
tarnished
by
the
philosophical
chatter
with
which
tolstoy
has
loaded
his
work
especially
in
the
later
portions
he
is
determined
to
make
an
exposition
of
his
theory
of
the
fatality
of
history
the
pity
is
that
he
returns
to
the
point
incessantly
and
obstinately
repeats
himself
flaubert
who
gave
vent
to
cries
of
admiration
while
reading
the
first
two
volumes
which
he
declared
sublime
and
full
of
shakespearean
things
threw
the
third
volume
aside
in
boredom
he
goes
off
horribly
he
repeats
himself
and
he
philosophises
we
see
the
aristocrat
the
author
and
the
russian
while
hitherto
we
have
seen
nothing
but
nature
and
humanity

while
he
was
finishing
and
in
the
summer

i

that
schopenhauer

the
most
genial
of

there
is
the

chapter
x
the
crisis
the
misery
which
oppressed
levine
and
the
longing
for
suicide
which
he
concealed
from
kitty
tolstoy
was
at
this
period
concealing
from
his
wife
but
he
had
not
as
yet
achieved
the
calm
which
he
attributed
to
his
hero
to
be
truthful
this
mental
state
is
hardly
communicated
to
the
reader
we
feel
that
it
is
desired
rather
than
realised
and
that
levine
relapse
among
his
doubts
is
imminent
tolstoy
was
not
duped
by
his
desires
he
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
reaching
the
end
of
his
work
wearied
him
before
he
had
finished
it
he
could
work
no
longer
he
remained
at
a
standstill
inert
without
a
prey
to
selfterror
and
there
in
the
emptiness
of
his
life
rose
the
great
wind
which
issued
from
the
abyss
the
vertigo
of
death
tolstoy
told
of
these
terrible
years
at
a
later
period
when
he
was
newly
escaped
from
the
abyss
i
was
not
fifty
he
said
i
loved
i
was
loved
i
had
good
children
a
great
estate
fame
health
and
moral
and
physical
vigour
i
could
reap
or
mow
like
any
peasant
i
used
to
work
ten
hours
at
a
stretch
without
fatigue
suddenly
my
life
came
to
a
standstill
i
could
breathe
eat
drink
and
sleep
but
this
was
not
to
live
i
had
no
desires
left
i
knew
there
was
nothing
to
desire
i
could
not
even
wish
to
know
the
truth
the
truth
was
that
life
is
a
piece
of
insanity
i
had
reached
the
abyss
and
i
saw
clearly
that
there
was
nothing
before
me
but
death
i
a
fortunate
and
healthy
man
felt
that
i
could
not
go
on
living
an
irresistible
force
was
urging
me
to
rid
myself
of
life
i
will
not
say
that
i
wanted
to
kill
myself
the
force
which
was
edging
me
out
of
life
was
something
stronger
than
myself
it
was
an
aspiration
a
desire
like
my
old
desire
for
life
but
in
an
inverse
sense
i
had
to
humour
to
deceive
myself
lest
i
should
give
way
to
it
too
promptly
there
i
was
a
happy
man
and
i
would
hide
away
a
piece
of
cord
lest
i
should
hang
myself
from
the
beam
that
ran
between
the
cupboards
of
my
room
where
i
was
alone
every
night
while
undressing
i
no
longer
took
my
gun
out
for
a
little
shooting
lest
i
should
be
tempted
it
seemed
to
me
that
life
was
a
dreary
farce
which
was
being
played
out
before
my
eyes
forty
years
of
work
of
trouble
of
progress
only
to
find
that
there
is
nothing
nothing
nothing
will
remain
of
me
but
putrescence
and
worms
one
can
live
only
while
one
is
intoxicated
with
life
but
the
moment
the
intoxication
is
over
one
sees
that
all
is
merely
deceit
a
clumsy
fraud
my
family
and
art
were
no
longer
enough
to
satisfy
me
my
family
consisted
of
unhappy
creatures
like
myself
art
is
a
mirror
to
life
when
life
no
longer
means
anything
it
is
no
longer
amusing
to
use
the
mirror
and
the
worst
of
it
was
i
could
not
resign
myself
i
was
like
a
man
lost
in
a
forest
who
is
seized
with
horror
because
he
is
lost
and
who
runs
hither
and
thither
and
can
not
stop
although
he
knows
that
at
every
step
he
is
straying
further
salvation
came
from
the
people
tolstoy
had
always
had
for
them
a
strange
affection
absolutely
genuine
which
the
repeated
experiences
of
his
social
disillusions
were
powerless
to
shake
of
late
years
he
like
levine
had
drawn
very
near
to
them
he
began
to
ponder
concerning
these
millions
of
beings
who
were
excluded
from
the
narrow
circle
of
the
learned
the
rich
and
the
idle
who
killed
themselves
endeavoured
to
forget
themselves
or
like
himself
were
basely
prolonging
a
hopeless
life
he
asked
himself
why
these
millions
of
men
and
women
escaped
this
despair
why
they
did
not
kill
themselves
he
then
perceived
that
they
were
living
not
by
the
light
of
reason
but
without
even
thinking
of
reason
they
were
living
by
faith
what
was
this
faith
which
knew
nothing
of
reason
faith
is
the
energy
of
life
one
can
not
live
without
faith
the
ideas
of
religion
were
elaborated
in
the
infinite
remoteness
of
human
thought
the
replies
given
by
faith
to
life
the
sphinx
contain
the
deepest
wisdom
of
humanity
is
it
enough
then
to
be
acquainted
with
those
formulæ
of
wisdom
recorded
in
the
volume
of
religion
no
for
faith
is
not
a
science
faith
is
an
act
it
has
no
meaning
unless
it
is
lived
the
disgust
which
tolstoy
felt
at
the
sight
of
rich
and
people
for
whom
faith
was
merely
a
kind
of
epicurean
consolation
threw
him
definitely
among
the
simple
folk
who
alone
lived
lives
in
agreement
with
their
faith
and
he
understood
that
the
life
of
the
labouring
people
was
life
itself
and
that
the
meaning
to
be
attributed
to
that
life
was
truth
but
how
become
a
part
of
the
people
and
share
its
faith
it
is
not
enough
to
know
that
others
are
in
the
right
it
does
not
depend
upon
ourselves
whether
we
are
like
them
we
pray
to
god
in
vain
in
vain
we
stretch
our
eager
arms
toward
him
god
flies
where
shall
he
be
found
but
one
day
grace
descended
one
day
of
early
spring
i
was
alone
in
the
forest
listening
to
its
sounds
i
was
thinking
of
my
distress
during
the
last
three
years
of
my
search
for
god
of
my
perpetual
oscillations
from
joy
to
despair
and
i
suddenly
saw
that
i
used
to
live
only
when
i
used
to
believe
in
god
at
the
very
thought
of
him
the
delightful
waves
of
life
stirred
in
me
everything
around
me
grew
full
of
life
everything
received
a
meaning
but
the
moment
i
no
longer
believed
life
suddenly
ceased
then
what
am
i
still
searching
for
a
voice
cried
within
me
for
him
without
whom
man
can
not
live
to
know
god
and
to
live
it
is
the
same
thing
for
god
is
life
since
then
this
light
has
never
again
deserted
me
he
was
saved
god
had
appeared
to
him
but
as
he
was
not
a
hindu
mystic
to
whom
ecstasy
suffices
as
to
the
dreams
of
the
asiatic
was
added
the
thirst
for
reason
and
the
need
of
action
of
the
occidental
he
was
moved
to
translate
his
revelation
into
terms
of
practical
faith
and
to
draw
from
the
holy
life
the
rules
of
daily
existence
without
any
previous
bias
and
sincerely
wishing
to
believe
in
the
beliefs
of
his
own
flesh
and
blood
he
began
by
studying
the
doctrine
of
the
orthodox
church
of
which
he
was
a
member
in
order
to
become
more
intimately
a
part
of
that
body
he
submitted
for
three
years
to
all
its
ceremonies
confessing
himself
communicating
not
presuming
to
judge
such
matters
as
shocked
him
inventing
explanations
for
what
he
found
obscure
or
incomprehensible
uniting
himself
through
and
in
their
faith
with
all
those
whom
he
loved
whether
living
or
dead
and
always
cherishing
the
hope
that
at
a
certain
moment
love
would
open
to
him
the
gates
of
truth
but
it
was
all
useless
his
reason
and
his
heart
revolted
such
ceremonies
as
baptism
and
communion
appeared
to
him
scandalous
when
he
was
forced
to
repeat
that
the
host
was
the
true
body
and
true
blood
of
christ
he
felt
as
though
a
knife
were
plunged
into
his
heart
but
it
was
not
the
dogmas
which
raised
between
the
church
and
himself
an
insurmountable
wall
but
the
practical
questions
and
in
especial
two
the
hateful
and
mutual
intolerance
of
the
churches
and
the
sanction
formal
or
tacit
of
homicide
of
war
and
of
capital
punishment
so
he
broke
loose
and
the
rupture
was
the
more
violent
in
that
for
three
years
he
had
suppressed
his
faculty
of
thought
he
walked
delicately
no
longer
angrily
and
violently
he
trampled
underfoot
the
religion
which
the
day
before
he
was
still
persistently
practising
in
his
of
dogmatic
he
termed
it
not
only
an
insanity
but
a
conscious
and
interested
lie
he
contrasted
it
with
the
new
testament
in
his
and
translation
of
the
four
finally
upon
the
gospel
he
built
his
faith
what
my
faith
consists
in
it
all
resides
in
these
words
i
believe
in
the
doctrine
of
the
christ
i
believe
that
happiness
is
possible
on
earth
only
when
all
men
shall
accomplish
it
its
is
the
sermon
on
the
mount
whose
essential
teaching
tolstoy
expresses
in
five
commandments
do
not
be
angry
do
not
commit
adultery
do
not
take
oaths
do
not
resist
evil
by
evil
be
no
man
enemy
this
is
the
negative
part
of
the
doctrine
the
positive
portion
is
contained
in
this
single
commandment
love
god
and
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
christ
has
said
that
he
who
shall
have
broken
the
least
of
these
commandments
will
hold
the
lowest
place
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
tolstoy
adds
naively
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
have
been
obliged
after
eighteen
centuries
to
discover
these
rules
as
a
novelty
does
tolstoy
believe
in
the
divinity
of
christ
by
no
means
in
what
quality
does
he
invoke
him
as
the
greatest
of
the
line
of
sages
brahma
buddha
confucius
zoroaster
isaiah
who
have
revealed
to
man
the
true
happiness
to
which
he
aspires
and
the
way
which
he
must
follow
tolstoy
is
the
disciple
of
these
great
religious
creators
of
these
hindu
chinese
and
hebrew
and
prophets
he
defends
them
as
he
knows
how
to
defend
defends
them
by
attacking
those
whom
he
calls
the
scribes
and
the
pharisees
by
attacking
the
established
churches
and
the
representatives
of
arrogant
science
or
rather
of
scientific
philosophism
not
that
he
appealed
from
reason
to
revelation
once
escaped
from
the
period
of
distress
described
in
his
he
remained
essentially
a
believer
in
reason
one
might
indeed
say
a
mystic
of
reason
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
he
says
with
john
the
word
logos
that
is
reason
a
book
of
his
entitled
bears
as
epigraph
the
famous
lines
of
pascal
man
is
nothing
but
a
reed
the
most
feeble
thing
in
nature
but
he
is
a
thinking
reed
all
our
dignity
resides
in
thought
let
us
then
strive
to
think
well
that
is
the
principle
of
morality
the
whole
book
moreover
is
nothing
but
a
hymn
to
reason
it
is
true
that
tolstoy
reason
is
not
the
scientific
reason
the
restricted
reason
which
takes
the
part
for
the
whole
and
physical
life
for
the
whole
of
life
but
the
sovereign
law
which
rules
the
life
of
man
the
law
according
to
which
beings
that
is
men
must
of
necessity
live
their
lives
it
is
a
law
analogous
to
those
which
regulate
the
nutrition
and
the
reproduction
of
the
animal
the
growth
and
the
blossoming
of
herb
and
of
tree
the
movement
of
the
earth
and
the
planets
it
is
only
in
the
accomplishment
of
this
law
in
the
submission
of
our
animal
nature
to
the
law
of
reason
with
a
view
to
acquiring
goodness
that
we
truly
live
reason
can
not
be
defined
and
we
have
no
need
to
define
it
for
not
only
do
we
all
know
it
but
we
know
nothing
else
all
that
man
knows
he
knows
by
means
of
reason
and
not
by
faith
true
life
commences
only
at
the
moment
when
reason
is
manifested
the
only
real
life
is
the
life
of
reason
then
what
is
the
visible
life
our
individual
existence
it
is
not
our
life
says
tolstoy
for
it
does
not
depend
upon
ourselves
our
animal
activity
is
accomplished
without
ourselves
humanity
has
done
with
the
idea
of
life
considered
as
an
individual
existence
the
negation
of
the
possibility
of
individual
good
remains
an
unchangeable
truth
for
every
man
of
our
period
who
is
endowed
with
reason
then
follows
a
long
series
of
postulates
which
i
will
not
here
discuss
but
which
show
how
tolstoy
was
obsessed
by
the
idea
of
reason
it
was
in
fact
a
passion
no
less
blind
or
jealous
than
the
other
passions
which
had
possessed
him
during
the
earlier
part
of
his
life
one
fire
was
flickering
out
the
other
was
kindling
or
rather
it
was
always
the
same
fire
but
fed
with
a
different
fuel
a
fact
which
adds
to
the
resemblance
between
the
individual
passions
and
this
rational
passion
is
that
neither
those
nor
this
can
be
satisfied
with
loving
they
seek
to
act
they
long
for
realisation
christ
has
said
we
must
not
speak
but
act
and
what
is
the
activity
of
reason
love
love
is
the
only
reasonable
activity
of
man
love
is
the
most
reasonable
and
most
enlightened
state
of
the
soul
all
that
man
needs
is
that
nothing
shall
obscure
the
sun
of
reason
for
that
alone
can
help
him
to
grow
love
is
the
actual
good
the
supreme
good
which
resolves
all
the
contradictions
of
life
which
not
only
dissipates
the
fear
of
death
but
impels
man
to
sacrifice
himself
to
others
for
there
is
no
love
but
that
which
enables
a
man
to
give
his
life
for
those
he
loves
love
is
not
worthy
of
the
name
unless
it
is
a
sacrifice
of
self
and
the
true
love
can
only
be
realised
when
man
understands
that
it
is
not
possible
for
him
to
acquire
individual
happiness
it
is
then
that
all
the
streams
of
his
life
go
to
nourish
the
noble
graft
of
the
true
love
and
this
graft
borrows
for
its
increase
all
the
energies
of
the
wild
stock
of
animal
individuality
thus
tolstoy
did
not
come
to
the
refuge
of
faith
like
an
exhausted
river
which
loses
itself
among
the
sands
he
brought
to
it
the
torrent
of
impetuous
energies
amassed
during
a
full
and
virile
life
this
we
shall
presently
see
this
impassioned
faith
in
which
love
and
reason
are
united
in
a
close
embrace
has
found
its
most
dignified
expression
in
the
famous
reply
to
the
holy
synod
which
excommunicated
him
i
believe
in
god
who
for
me
is
love
the
spirit
the
principle
of
all
things
i
believe
that
he
is
in
me
as
i
am
in
him
i
believe
that
the
will
of
god
has
never
been
more
clearly
expressed
than
in
the
teaching
of
the
man
christ
but
we
can
not
regard
christ
as
god
and
address
our
prayers
to
him
without
committing
the
greatest
sacrilege
i
believe
that
the
true
happiness
of
man
consists
in
the
accomplishment
of
the
will
of
god
i
believe
that
the
will
of
god
is
that
every
man
shall
love
his
fellows
and
do
unto
them
always
as
he
would
they
should
do
unto
him
which
contains
as
the
bible
says
all
the
law
and
the
prophets
i
believe
that
the
meaning
of
life
for
each
one
of
us
is
only
to
increase
the
love
within
him
i
believe
that
this
development
of
our
power
of
loving
will
reward
us
in
this
life
with
a
happiness
which
will
increase
day
by
day
and
with
a
more
perfect
felicity
in
the
other
world
i
believe
that
this
increase
of
love
will
contribute
more
than
any
other
factor
to
founding
the
kingdom
of
god
upon
earth
that
is
to
replacing
an
organisation
of
life
in
which
division
deceit
and
violence
are
omnipotent
by
a
new
order
in
which
concord
truth
and
brotherhood
will
reign
i
believe
that
we
have
only
one
means
of
growing
richer
in
love
namely
our
prayers
not
public
prayer
in
the
temple
which
christ
has
formally
reproved
matt
vi
but
the
prayer
of
which
he
himself
has
given
as
an
example
the
solitary
prayer
which
confirms
in
us
the
consciousness
of
the
meaning
of
our
life
and
the
feeling
that
we
depend
solely
upon
the
will
of
god
i
believe
in
life
eternal
i
believe
that
man
is
rewarded
according
to
his
acts
here
and
everywhere
now
and
for
ever
i
believe
all
these
things
so
firmly
that
at
my
age
on
the
verge
of
the
tomb
i
have
often
to
make
an
effort
not
to
pray
for
the
death
of
my
body
that
is
my
birth
into
a
new
life
now
i
am
harnessing
myself
again
to
the
wearisome
and
vulgar
with
the
sole
desire
of
getting
rid
of
it
as
quickly
as
possible
letters
to
fet
august
i
must
finish
the
romance
which
is
wearying
me
march
in
his
see
and
levine
who
had
the
love
of
a
woman
and
was
the
father
of
a
family
put
every
kind
of
weapon
away
out
of
reach
as
though
he
was
afraid
of
yielding
to
the
temptation
of
putting
an
end
to
his
sufferings
this
frame
of
mind
was
not
peculiar
to
tolstoy
and
his
characters
tolstoy
was
struck
by
the
increasing
number
of
suicides
among
the
wealthy
classes
all
over
europe
and
in
russia
more
especially
he
often
alludes
to
the
fact
in
such
of
his
books
as
were
written
about
this
period
it
was
as
though
a
great
wave
of
neurasthenia
had
swept
across
europe
in
drowning
its
thousands
of
victims
those
who
were
young
men
at
the
time
will
remember
it
and
for
them
tolstoy
record
of
this
human
experience
will
have
a
historic
value
he
has
written
the
secret
tragedy
of
a
generation
f
his
portraits
of
this
period
betray
this
plebeian
tendency
a
painting
by
kramskoy
represents
tolstoy
in
a
moujik
blouse
with
bowed
head
it
resembles
a
german
christ
the
forehead
is
growing
bare
at
the
temples
the
cheeks
are
lined
and
in
another
portrait
dated
he
has
the
look
of
a
respectable
artisan
in
his
sunday
clothes
the
hair
cut
short
the
beard
and
whiskers
spread
out
on
either
side
the
face
looks
much
wider
below
than
above
the
eyebrows
are
contracted
the
eyes
gloomy
the
wide
nostrils
have
a
appearance
the
ears
are
enormous
to
tell
the
truth
not
for
the
first
time
the
young
volunteer
in
the
caucasus
the
officer
at
sebastopol
olenin
of
the
prince
andrei
and
pierre
besoukhov
in
and
peace
had
had
similar
visions
but
tolstoy
was
so
enthusiastic
that
each
time
he
discovered
god
he
believed
it
was
for
the
first
time
that
previously
there
had
been
nothing
but
night
and
the
void
he
saw
nothing
of
his
past
but
its
shadows
and
its
shames
we
who
through
reading
his
know
better
than
he
himself
the
story
of
his
heart
know
also
how
profoundly
religious
was
that
heart
even
when
he
was
most
astray
but
he
himself
confesses
in
a
passage
in
the
preface
to
the
o
dogmatic
theology
god
god
i
have
erred
i
have
sought
the
truth
where
i
should
not
have
sought
it
and
i
knew
that
i
erred
i
flattered
my
evil
passions
knowing
them
to
be
evil
i
never
forgot
thee
i
was
always
conscious
of
thee
even
when
i
went
the
crisis
of
was
only
more
violent
than
the
rest
perhaps
under
the
influence
of
repeated
loss
and
the
advance
of
age
its
only
novelty
was
that
the
image
of
god
instead
of
vanishing
and
leaving
no
trace
when
once
the
flame
of
ecstasy
flickered
out
remained
with
him
and
the
penitent
warned
by
past
experience
hastened
to
walk
in
the
light
while
he
had
the
light
and
to
deduce
from
his
faith
a
whole
system
of
life
not
that
he
had
not
already
tried
to
do
so
remember
the
of
written
when
he
was
a
student
but
at
fifty
years
of
age
there
was
less
likelihood
that
his
passions
would
divert
him
from
his
path
the
of
the
is
to
the
criticism
of
dogmatic
theology
and
the
examination
of
the
christian
i
who
beheld
the
truth
in
the
unity
of
love
was
struck
with
the
fact
that
religion
itself
destroyed
that
which
it
sought
to
produce
and
i
am
convinced
that
the
teaching
of
the
church
is
in
theory
a
crafty
and
evil
lie
and
in
practice
a
concoction
of
gross
superstitions
and
witchcraft
under
which
the
meaning
of
the
christian
doctrine
absolutely
disappears
to
the
holy
synod
april
as
he
grew
older
this
feeling
of
the
unity
of
religious
truth
throughout
human
history
and
of
the
kinship
of
christ
with
the
other
sages
from
buddha
down
to
kant
and
emerson
grew
more
and
more
accentuated
until
in
his
later
years
tolstoy
denied
that
he
had
any
predilection
for
christianity
of
the
greatest
importance
in
this
connection
is
a
letter
written
between
july
and
august
to
the
painter
jan
styka
and
recently
reproduced
in
january
according
to
his
habit
tolstoy
full
of
his
new
conviction
was
a
little
inclined
to
forget
his
former
state
of
mind
and
the
of
his
religious
crisis
which
was
purely
christian
the
doctrine
of
jesus
he
writes
is
to
me
only
one
of
the
beautiful
doctrines
which
we
have
received
from
the
ancient
civilisations
of
egypt
israel
hindostan
china
greece
the
two
great
principles
of
jesus
the
love
of
god
that
is
of
absolute
perfection
and
the
love
of
one
neighbour
that
is
of
all
men
without
distinction
have
been
preached
by
all
the
sages
of
the
world
krishna
buddha
confucius
socrates
plato
epictetus
marcus
aurelius
and
among
the
moderns
rousseau
pascal
kant
emerson
channing
and
many
others
truth
moral
and
religious
is
everywhere
and
always
the
same
i
have
no
predilection
for
christianity
if
i
have
been
particularly
attracted
by
the
teaching
of
jesus
it
is
because
i
was
born
and
have
lived
among
christians
and
because
i
have
found
a
great
spiritual
joy
in
disengaging
the
pure
doctrine
from
the
astonishing
falsifications
created
by
the
churches
tolstoy
protests
that
he
does
not
attack
true
science
which
is
modest
and
knows
its
limits
chap
iv
there
is
a
french
version
by
countess
tolstoy
tolstoy
often
read
the
during
the
period
of
this
crisis
which
preceded
the
he
speaks
of
pascal
in
his
letters
to
fet
april
august
recommending
his
friend
to
read
the
in
a
letter
written
on
november
to
baroness
x
reproduced
in
tolstoy
says
the
same
thing
man
has
received
directly
from
god
one
sole
instrument
by
which
he
may
know
himself
and
his
relations
with
the
world
there
is
no
other
means
this
instrument
is
reason
reason
comes
from
god
it
is
not
only
the
highest
human
quality
but
the
only
means
by
which
the
truth
is
to
be
known
as
in
the
case
of
most
of
these
quotations
i
am
expressing
the
sense
of
several
chapters
in
a
few
characteristic
phrases
i
hope
later
when
the
complete
works
of
tolstoy
have
been
published
to
study
the
various
shades
of
this
religious
idea
which
has
certainly
evolved
in
respect
of
many
points
notably
in
respect
of
the
conception
of
future
life
from
a
translation
in
the
for
may
chapter
xi
reality
he
thought
he
had
arrived
in
port
had
achieved
the
haven
in
which
his
unquiet
soul
might
take
its
repose
he
was
only
at
the
beginning
of
a
new
period
of
activity
a
winter
passed
in
moscow
his
family
duties
having
obliged
him
to
follow
his
family
thither
and
the
taking
of
the
census
in
which
he
contrived
to
lend
a
hand
gave
him
the
occasion
to
examine
at
first
hand
the
poverty
of
a
great
city
the
impression
produced
upon
him
was
terrible
on
the
evening
of
the
day
when
he
first
came
into
contact
with
this
hidden
plague
of
civilisation
while
relating
to
a
friend
what
he
had
seen
he
began
to
shout
to
weep
and
to
brandish
his
fist
people
ca
live
like
that
he
cried
sobbing
it
can
not
be
it
can
not
be
he
fell
into
a
state
of
terrible
despair
which
did
not
leave
him
for
months
countess
tolstoy
wrote
to
him
on
the
of
march
you
used
to
say
used
to
want
to
hang
myself
because
of
my
lack
of
faith
now
you
have
faith
why
then
are
you
so
unhappy
because
he
had
not
the
sanctimonious
selfsatisfied
faith
of
the
pharisee
because
he
had
not
the
egoism
of
the
mystic
who
is
too
completely
absorbed
in
the
matter
of
his
own
salvation
to
think
of
the
salvation
of
others
because
he
knew
love
because
he
could
no
longer
forget
the
miserable
creatures
he
had
seen
and
in
the
passionate
tenderness
of
his
heart
he
felt
as
though
he
were
responsible
for
their
sufferings
and
their
abjectness
they
were
the
victims
of
that
civilisation
in
whose
privileges
he
shared
of
that
monstrous
idol
to
which
an
elect
and
superior
class
was
always
sacrificing
millions
of
human
beings
to
accept
the
benefit
of
such
crimes
was
to
become
an
accomplice
his
conscience
would
have
given
him
no
repose
had
he
not
denounced
them
shall
we
do
is
the
expression
of
this
second
crisis
a
crisis
far
more
tragic
than
the
first
and
far
richer
in
consequences
what
were
the
personal
religious
sufferings
of
tolstoy
in
this
ocean
of
human
wretchedness
of
material
misery
not
misery
created
by
the
mind
of
a
idler
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
shut
his
eyes
to
it
and
having
seen
it
he
could
but
strive
at
any
cost
to
prevent
it
alas
was
such
a
thing
possible
an
admirable
portrait
which
i
can
not
look
at
without
emotion
tells
us
plainly
what
suffering
tolstoy
was
then
enduring
it
shows
him
facing
the
camera
seated
with
his
arms
crossed
he
is
moujik
blouse
he
looks
overwhelmed
his
hair
is
still
black
but
his
moustache
is
already
grey
and
his
long
beard
and
whiskers
are
quite
white
a
double
furrow
traces
symmetrical
lines
in
the
large
comely
face
there
is
so
much
goodness
such
tenderness
in
the
great
muzzle
in
the
eyes
that
regard
you
with
so
frank
so
clear
so
sorrowful
a
look
they
read
your
mind
so
surely
they
pity
and
implore
the
face
is
furrowed
and
bears
traces
of
suffering
there
are
heavy
creases
beneath
the
eyes
he
has
wept
but
he
is
strong
and
ready
for
the
fight
his
logic
was
heroic
i
am
always
astonished
by
these
words
so
often
repeated
it
is
well
enough
in
theory
but
how
would
it
be
in
practice
as
if
theory
consisted
in
pretty
words
necessary
for
conversation
and
was
not
in
the
least
something
to
which
practice
should
conform
when
i
come
to
understand
a
matter
on
which
i
have
reflected
i
can
not
do
otherwise
than
as
i
have
understood
he
begins
by
describing
with
photographic
exactitude
the
poverty
of
moscow
as
he
has
seen
it
in
the
course
of
his
visits
to
the
poorer
quarters
or
the
he
is
convinced
that
money
is
not
the
power
as
he
had
at
first
supposed
which
will
save
these
unhappy
creatures
all
more
or
less
tainted
by
the
corruption
of
the
cities
then
he
seeks
bravely
for
the
source
of
the
evil
unwinding
link
upon
link
of
the
terrible
chain
of
responsibility
first
come
the
rich
with
the
contagion
of
their
accursed
luxury
which
entices
and
depraves
the
soul
then
comes
the
universal
seduction
of
life
without
labour
then
the
state
that
murderous
entity
created
by
the
violent
in
order
that
they
might
for
their
own
profit
despoil
and
enslave
the
rest
of
humanity
then
the
church
an
accomplice
science
and
art
accomplices
how
is
a
man
to
oppose
this
army
of
evil
in
the
first
place
by
refusing
to
join
it
by
refusing
to
share
in
the
exploitation
of
humanity
by
renouncing
wealth
and
ownership
of
the
soil
and
by
refusing
to
serve
the
state
but
this
is
not
sufficient
one
must
not
lie
nor
be
afraid
of
the
truth
one
must
repent
and
uproot
the
pride
that
is
implanted
by
education
finally
one
must
work
with
one
hands
thou
shalt
win
thy
bread
in
the
sweat
of
thy
brow
is
the
first
commandment
and
the
most
essential
and
tolstoy
replying
in
advance
to
the
ridicule
of
the
elect
maintains
that
physical
labour
does
not
in
any
way
decrease
the
energy
of
the
intellect
but
that
on
the
contrary
it
increases
it
and
that
it
responds
to
the
normal
demand
of
nature
health
can
only
gain
thereby
art
will
gain
even
more
but
what
is
more
important
still
it
will
the
union
of
man
with
man
in
his
subsequent
works
tolstoy
was
to
complete
these
precepts
of
moral
hygiene
he
was
anxious
to
achieve
the
cure
of
the
soul
to
replenish
its
energy
by
proscribing
the
vicious
pleasures
which
deaden
the
conscience
and
the
cruel
pleasures
which
kill
it
he
himself
set
the
example
in
he
sacrificed
his
most
deeply
rooted
passion
his
love
of
the
chase
he
practised
abstinence
which
strengthens
the
will
so
an
athlete
may
subject
himself
to
some
painful
discipline
that
he
may
grapple
with
it
and
conquer
shall
we
do
marks
the
first
stage
of
the
difficult
journey
upon
which
tolstoy
was
about
to
embark
quitting
the
relative
peace
of
religious
meditation
for
the
social
maëlstrom
it
was
then
that
the
twenty
years
war
commenced
which
the
old
prophet
of
yasnaya
polyana
waged
in
the
name
of
the
gospel
outside
the
limits
of
all
parties
and
condemning
all
a
war
upon
the
crimes
and
lies
of
civilisation
i
had
hitherto
passed
my
whole
life
away
from
the
city
shall
we
do
tolstoy
has
many
times
expressed
his
antipathy
for
the
ascetics
who
live
for
themselves
only
apart
from
their
fellows
he
puts
them
in
the
same
class
as
the
conceited
and
ignorant
revolutionists
who
pretend
to
do
good
to
others
without
knowing
what
it
is
that
they
themselves
need
i
love
these
two
categories
of
men
with
the
same
love
but
i
hate
their
doctrines
with
the
same
hate
the
only
doctrine
is
that
which
orders
a
constant
activity
an
existence
which
responds
to
the
aspirations
of
the
soul
and
endeavours
to
realise
the
happiness
of
others
such
is
the
christian
doctrine
equally
remote
from
religious
quietism
and
the
arrogant
pretensions
of
the
revolutionists
who
seek
to
transform
the
world
without
knowing
in
what
real
happiness
consists

we
do
in
the
complete
french
edition
shall
we
do
all
the
first
part
of
the
book
the
first
fifteen
chapters
the
true
cause
of
poverty
is
the
accumulation
of
riches
in
the
hands
of
those
who
do
not
produce
and
are
concentrated
in
the
cities
the
wealthy
classes
are
gathered
together
in
the
cities
in
order
to
enjoy
and
to
defend
themselves
and
the
poor
man
comes
to
feed
upon
the
crumbs
of
the
rich
he
is
drawn
thither
by
the
snare
of
easy
gain
by
peddling
begging
swindling
or
in
the
service
of
immorality
the
pivot
of
the
evil
is
property
property
is
merely
the
means
cf
enjoying
the
labour
of
others
property
he
says
again
is
that
which
is
not
ours
it
represents
other
people
man
calls
his
wife
his
children
his
slaves
his
goods
his
property
but
reality
shows
him
his
error
and
he
must
renounce
his
property
or
suffer
and
cause
others
to
suffer
tolstoy
was
already
urging
the
russian
revolution
for
three
or
four
years
now
men
have
cursed
us
on
the
highway
and
called
us
sluggards
and
skulkers
the
hatred
and
contempt
of
the
downtrodden
people
are
becoming
more
intense
shall
we
do
the
bondarev
would
have
had
this
law
recognised
as
a
universal
obligation
tolstoy
was
then
subject
to
his
influence
as
also
to
that
of
another
peasant
during
the
whole
of
my
life
two
russian
thinkers
have
had
a
great
moral
influence
over
me
have
enriched
my
mind
and
have
elucidated
for
me
my
own
conception
of
the
world
they
were
two
peasants
sutayev
and
bondarev
shall
we
do
in
the
same
book
tolstoy
gives
us
a
portrait
of
sutayev
and
records
a
conversation
with
him
pleasures
or
in
the
french
translation
and
tobacco
war
the
sacrifice
was
difficult
the
passion
inherited
he
was
not
sentimental
he
never
felt
much
pity
for
animals
for
him
all
things
fell
into
three
planes
reasoning
beings
animals
and
plants
inanimate
matter
he
was
not
without
a
trace
of
native
cruelty
he
relates
the
pleasure
he
felt
in
watching
the
struggles
of
a
wolf
which
he
killed
remorse
was
of
later
growth
chapter
xii
art
and
conscience
this
moral
revolution
of
tolstoy
met
with
little
sympathy
from
his
immediate
world
his
family
and
his
relatives
were
appalled
by
it
for
a
long
time
countess
tolstoy
had
been
anxiously
watching
the
progress
of
a
symptom
against
which
she
had
fought
in
vain
as
early
as
she
had
seen
with
indignation
the
amount
of
time
and
energy
which
her
husband
spent
in
connection
with
the
schools
this
this
arithmetic
this
grammar
i
feel
a
contempt
for
them
and
i
can
not
assume
a
semblance
of
interest
in
them
matters
were
very
different
when
pedagogy
was
succeeded
by
religion
so
hostile
was
the
countess
reception
of
the
first
confidences
of
the
convert
that
tolstoy
felt
obliged
to
apologise
when
he
spoke
of
god
in
his
letters
do
not
be
vexed
as
you
so
often
are
when
i
mention
god
i
can
not
help
it
for
he
is
the
very
basis
of
my
thought
the
countess
was
touched
no
doubt
she
tried
to
conceal
her
impatience
but
she
did
not
understand
and
she
watched
her
husband
anxiously
his
eyes
are
strange
and
fixed
he
scarcely
speaks
he
does
not
seem
to
belong
to
this
world
she
feared
he
was
leo
is
always
working
by
what
he
tells
me
alas
he
is
writing
religious
discussions
of
some
kind
he
reads
and
he
ponders
until
he
gives
himself
the
headache
and
all
this
to
prove
that
the
church
is
not
in
agreement
with
the
teaching
of
the
gospel
he
will
hardly
find
a
dozen
people
in
russia
whom
the
matter
could
possibly
interest
but
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
i
have
only
one
hope
that
he
will
be
done
with
it
all
the
sooner
and
that
it
will
pass
off
like
an
illness
the
illness
did
not
pass
away
the
situation
between
husband
and
wife
became
more
and
more
painful
they
loved
one
another
each
had
a
profound
esteem
for
the
other
but
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
understand
one
another
they
strove
to
make
mutual
concessions
which
became
as
is
usually
the
case
a
form
of
mutual
torment
tolstoy
forced
himself
to
follow
his
family
to
moscow
he
wrote
in
his
the
most
painful
month
of
my
life
getting
settled
in
moscow
all
are
settling
down
but
when
then
will
they
begin
to
live
all
this
not
in
order
to
live
but
because
other
folk
do
the
same
unhappy
people
during
these
days
the
countess
wrote
moscow
we
shall
have
been
here
a
month
tomorrow
the
first
two
weeks
i
cried
every
day
for
leo
was
not
only
sad
but
absolutely
broken
he
did
not
sleep
he
did
not
eat
at
times
even
he
wept
i
thought
i
should
go
mad
for
a
time
they
had
to
live
their
lives
apart
they
begged
one
another
pardon
for
causing
mutual
suffering
we
see
how
they
always
loved
each
other
he
writes
to
her
you
say
love
you
and
you
do
not
need
my
love
it
is
the
only
thing
i
do
need
your
love
causes
me
more
gladness
than
anything
in
the
world
but
as
soon
as
they
are
together
again
the
same
discord
occurs
the
countess
can
not
share
this
religious
mania
which
is
now
impelling
tolstoy
to
study
hebrew
with
a
rabbi
nothing
else
interests
him
any
longer
he
is
wasting
his
energies
in
foolishness
i
can
not
conceal
my
impatience
she
writes
to
him
it
can
only
sadden
me
that
such
intellectual
energies
should
spend
themselves
in
chopping
wood
heating
the
samovar
and
cobbling
boots
she
adds
with
affectionate
humour
of
a
mother
who
watches
a
child
playing
a
foolish
game
finally
i
have
pacified
myself
with
the
russian
proverb
the
child
play
as
he
will
so
long
as
he
does
cry
before
the
letter
was
posted
she
had
a
mental
vision
of
her
husband
reading
these
lines
his
kind
frank
eyes
saddened
by
their
ironical
tone
and
she
the
letter
in
an
impulse
of
affection
quite
suddenly
i
saw
you
so
clearly
and
i
felt
such
a
rush
of
tenderness
for
you
there
is
something
in
you
so
wise
so
naive
so
persevering
and
it
is
all
lit
up
by
the
radiance
of
goodness
and
that
look
of
yours
which
goes
straight
to
the
soul
it
is
something
that
belongs
to
you
alone
in
this
manner
these
two
creatures
who
loved
also
tormented
one
another
and
were
straightway
stricken
with
wretchedness
because
of
the
pain
they
had
the
power
to
inflict
but
not
the
power
to
avoid
a
situation
with
no
escape
which
lasted
for
nearly
thirty
years
which
was
to
be
terminated
only
by
the
flight
across
the
steppes
in
a
moment
of
aberration
of
the
ancient
lear
with
death
already
upon
him
critics
have
not
sufficiently
remarked
the
moving
appeal
to
women
which
terminates
shall
we
do
tolstoy
had
no
sympathy
for
modern
feminism
but
of
the
type
whom
he
calls
the
the
woman
who
knows
the
real
meaning
of
life
he
speaks
in
terms
of
pious
admiration
he
pronounces
a
magnificent
eulogy
of
her
pains
and
her
joys
of
pregnancy
and
maternity
of
the
terrible
sufferings
the
years
without
rest
the
invisible
exhausting
travail
for
which
no
reward
is
expected
and
of
that
beatitude
which
floods
the
soul
at
the
happy
issue
from
labour
when
the
body
has
accomplished
the
law
he
draws
the
portrait
of
the
valiant
wife
who
is
a
help
not
an
obstacle
to
her
husband
she
knows
that
the
vocation
of
man
is
the
obscure
lonely
sacrifice
unrewarded
for
the
life
of
others
such
a
woman
will
not
only
not
encourage
her
husband
in
factitious
and
meriticious
work
whose
only
end
is
to
profit
by
and
enjoy
the
labour
of
others
but
she
will
regard
such
activity
with
horror
and
disgust
as
a
possible
seduction
for
her
children
she
will
demand
of
her
companion
a
true
labour
which
will
call
for
energy
and
does
not
fear
danger
she
knows
that
the
children
the
generations
to
come
are
given
to
men
as
their
holiest
vision
and
that
she
exists
to
further
with
all
her
being
this
sacred
task
she
will
develop
in
her
children
and
in
her
husband
the
strength
of
sacrifice
it
is
such
women
who
rule
men
and
serve
as
their
guiding
star
o
in
your
hands
is
the
salvation
of
the
world
this
appeal
of
a
voice
of
supplication
which
still
has
hope
will
it
not
be
heard
a
few
years
later
the
last
glimmer
of
hope
was
dead
perhaps
you
will
not
believe
me
but
you
can
not
imagine
how
isolated
i
am
nor
in
what
a
degree
my
veritable
is
despised
and
disregarded
by
all
those
about
me
if
those
who
loved
him
best
so
misunderstood
the
grandeur
of
the
moral
transformation
which
tolstoy
was
undergoing
one
could
not
look
for
more
penetration
or
greater
respect
in
others
tourgenev
with
whom
he
had
sought
to
effect
a
reconciliation
rather
in
a
spirit
of
christian
humility
than
because
his
feelings
towards
him
had
suffered
any
change
said
ironically
of
tolstoy
i
pity
him
greatly
but
after
all
as
the
french
say
every
one
kills
his
own
fleas
in
his
own
way
a
few
years
later
when
on
the
point
of
death
he
wrote
to
tolstoy
the
letter
in
which
he
prayed
his
friend
the
great
writer
of
the
russian
world
to
return
to
literature
all
the
artists
of
europe
shared
the
anxiety
and
the
prayer
of
the
dying
tourgenev
melchior
de
vogüé
at
the
end
of
his
study
of
tolstoy
written
in
made
a
portrait
of
the
writer
in
peasant
costume
handling
a
drill
the
pretext
for
an
eloquent
apostrophe

maker
of

this
is
not
your
tool
our
tool
is
the
pen
our
field
the
human
soul
which
we
must
shelter
and
nourish
let
us
remind
you
of
the
words
of
a
russian
peasant
of
the
the
first
printer
of
moscow
when
he
was
sent
back
to
the
plough
is
not
my
business
to
sow
grains
of
corn
but
to
sow
the
seed
of
the
spirit
broadcast
in
the
world
as
though
tolstoy
had
ever
renounced
his
vocation
as
a
sower
of
the
seed
of
the
mind
in
the
introduction
to
i
he
wrote
i
believe
that
my
life
my
reason
my
light
is
given
me
exclusively
for
the
purpose
of
enlightening
my
fellows
i
believe
that
my
knowledge
of
the
truth
is
a
talent
which
is
lent
me
for
this
object
that
this
talent
is
a
fire
which
is
a
fire
only
when
it
is
being
consumed
i
believe
that
the
only
meaning
of
my
life
is
that
i
should
live
it
only
by
the
light
within
me
and
should
hold
that
light
on
high
before
men
that
they
may
see
it
but
this
light
this
fire
which
was
a
fire
only
when
it
was
being
consumed
was
a
cause
of
anxiety
to
the
majority
of
the
more
intelligent
could
not
but
suspect
that
there
was
a
great
risk
that
their
art
would
be
the
first
prey
of
the
conflagration
they
professed
to
believe
that
the
whole
art
of
literature
was
menaced
that
the
russian
like
prospero
was
burying
for
ever
his
magic
ring
with
its
power
of
creative
illusion
nothing
was
further
from
the
truth
and
i
hope
to
show
that
so
far
from
ruining
his
art
tolstoy
was
awakening
forces
which
had
lain
fallow
and
that
his
religious
faith
instead
of
killing
his
artistic
genius
regenerated
it
completely
the
summer
of
october

participate

imaginary
labours
of
the
wealthy
classes
with
a
view
to
enjoying
the
fruit
of
the
labour
of
others
and
to
live
a
life
that
satisfies
the
sensual
appetites

science
and
art
it
is
a
singular
fact
that
in
speaking
of
tolstoy
ideas
concerning
science
and
art
the
most
important
of
the
books
in
which
these
ideas
are
expressed
namely
shall
we
do
is
commonly
ignored
there
for
the
first
time
tolstoy
fights
the
battle
between
art
and
science
and
none
of
the
following
conflicts
was
to
surpass
the
violence
of
their
first
encounter
it
is
a
matter
for
surprise
that
no
one
during
the
assaults
which
have
been
recently
delivered
in
france
upon
the
vanity
of
science
and
the
intellectuals
has
thought
of
referring
to
these
pages
they
constitute
the
most
terrible
attack
ever
penned
against
the
eunuchs
of
science
and
the
corsairs
of
art
against
those
intellectual
castes
which
having
destroyed
the
old
ruling
castes
of
the
church
the
state
and
the
army
have
installed
themselves
in
their
place
and
without
being
able
or
willing
to
perform
any
service
of
use
to
humanity
lay
claim
to
a
blind
admiration
and
service
proclaiming
as
dogmas
an
impudent
faith
in
science
for
the
sake
of
science
and
in
art
for
the
sake
of
art
the
lying
mask
which
they
seek
to
make
their
justification
and
the
apology
for
their
monstrous
egoism
and
their
emptiness
never
make
me
say
continues
tolstoy
that
i
deny
art
or
science
not
only
do
i
not
deny
them
it
is
in
their
name
that
i
seek
to
drive
the
thieves
from
the
temple
science
and
art
are
as
necessary
as
bread
and
water
even
more
necessary
the
true
science
is
that
of
the
true
welfare
of
all
human
beings
the
true
art
is
the
expression
of
the
knowledge
of
the
true
welfare
of
all
men
and
he
praises
those
who
since
men
have
existed
have
with
the
harp
or
the
cymbal
by
images
or
by
words
expressed
their
struggle
against
duplicity
their
sufferings
in
that
struggle
their
hope
in
the
triumph
of
good
their
despair
at
the
triumph
of
evil
and
the
enthusiasm
of
their
prophetic
vision
of
the
future
he
then
draws
the
character
of
the
perfect
artist
in
a
page
burning
with
mystical
and
melancholy
earnestness
the
activity
of
science
and
art
is
only
fruitful
when
it
arrogates
no
right
to
itself
and
considers
only
its
duties
it
is
only
because
that
activity
is
such
as
it
is
because
its
essence
is
sacrifice
that
humanity
honours
it
the
men
who
are
called
to
serve
others
by
spiritual
work
always
suffer
in
the
accomplishment
of
that
task
for
the
spiritual
world
is
brought
to
birth
only
in
suffering
and
torture
sacrifice
and
suffering
such
is
the
fate
of
the
thinker
and
the
artist
for
his
fate
is
the
good
of
men
men
are
unhappy
they
suffer
they
die
there
is
no
time
for
him
to
stroll
about
to
amuse
himself
the
thinker
or
the
artist
never
strays
upon
olympian
heights
as
we
are
accustomed
to
think
he
is
always
in
a
state
of
conflict
always
in
a
state
of
emotion
he
must
decide
and
must
say
what
will
further
the
welfare
of
men
what
will
deliver
them
from
suffering
and
he
has
not
decided
it
he
has
not
said
it
and
it
will
perhaps
be
too
late
and
he
will
die
the
man
who
is
trained
in
an
establishment
in
which
artists
and
scientists
are
formed
to
tell
the
truth
such
places
make
destroyers
of
art
and
of
science
the
man
who
receives
diplomas
and
a
pension
he
will
not
be
an
artist
or
a
thinker
but
he
who
would
be
happy
not
to
think
not
to
express
what
is
implanted
in
his
mind
yet
can
not
refrain
from
thought
and
for
he
is
carried
along
by
two
invisible
forces
his
inner
need
and
his
love
of
men
there
are
no
artists
who
are
fat
lovers
of
life
and
satisfied
with
themselves
this
splendid
page
which
throws
a
tragic
light
upon
the
genius
of
tolstoy
was
written
under
the
immediate
stress
of
the
suffering
caused
him
by
the
poverty
of
moscow
and
under
the
conviction
that
science
and
art
were
the
accomplices
of
the
entire
modern
system
of
social
inequality
and
hypocritical
brutality
this
conviction
he
was
never
to
lose
but
the
impression
of
his
first
encounter
with
the
misery
of
the
world
slowly
faded
and
became
less
poignant
the
wound
healed
and
in
none
of
his
subsequent
books
do
we
recover
the
tremor
of
pain
and
of
vengeful
anger
which
vibrates
in
this
nowhere
do
we
find
this
sublime
profession
of
the
faith
of
the
artist
who
creates
with
his
this
exaltation
of
the
sacrifice
and
suffering
which
are
the
lot
of
the
thinker
this
disdain
for
olympian
art
those
of
his
later
works
which
deal
with
the
criticism
of
art
will
be
found
to
treat
the
question
from
a
standpoint
at
once
more
literary
and
less
mystical
the
problem
of
art
is
detached
from
the
background
of
that
human
wretchedness
of
which
tolstoy
could
not
think
without
losing
his
as
on
the
night
of
his
visit
to
the
when
upon
returning
home
he
sobbed
and
cried
aloud
in
desperation
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
these
didactic
works
are
ever
frigid
it
is
impossible
for
tolstoy
to
be
frigid
until
the
end
of
his
life
he
is
the
man
who
writes
to
fet
if
he
does
not
love
his
personages
even
the
least
of
them
then
he
must
insult
them
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
the
heavens
fall
or
must
mock
at
them
until
he
splits
his
sides
he
does
not
forget
to
do
so
in
his
writings
on
art
the
negative
portion
of
this
statement
brimming
over
with
insults
and
sarcasms
is
so
vigorously
expressed
that
it
is
the
only
part
which
has
struck
the
artist
this
method
has
so
violently
wounded
the
superstitions
and
susceptibilities
of
the
brotherhood
that
they
inevitably
see
in
the
enemy
of
their
own
art
the
enemy
of
all
art
whatsoever
but
tolstoy
criticism
is
never
devoid
of
the
reconstructive
element
he
never
destroys
for
the
sake
of
destruction
but
only
to
rebuild
in
his
modesty
he
does
not
even
profess
to
build
anything
new
he
merely
defends
art
which
was
and
ever
shall
be
from
the
false
artists
who
exploit
it
and
dishonour
it
true
science
and
true
art
have
always
existed
and
will
always
exist
it
is
impossible
and
useless
to
attack
them
he
wrote
to
me
in
in
a
letter
which
anticipated
by
more
than
ten
years
his
famous
criticism
of
art
is
art
all
the
evil
of
the
day
comes
from
the
fact
that
civilised
people
together
with
the
scientists
and
artists
form
a
privileged
caste
like
so
many
priests
and
this
caste
has
all
the
faults
of
all
castes
it
degrades
and
lowers
the
principle
in
virtue
of
which
it
was
organised
what
we
in
our
world
call
the
sciences
and
the
arts
is
merely
a
gigantic
a
gross
superstition
into
which
we
commonly
fall
as
soon
as
we
free
ourselves
from
the
old
superstition
of
the
church
to
keep
safely
to
the
road
we
ought
to
follow
we
must
begin
at
the
beginning
we
must
raise
the
cowl
which
keeps
us
warm
but
obscures
our
sight
the
temptation
is
great
we
are
born
or
we
clamber
upon
the
rungs
of
the
ladder
and
we
find
among
the
privileged
the
priests
of
civilisation
of
as
the
germans
have
it
like
the
brahmin
or
catholic
priests
we
must
have
a
great
deal
of
sincerity
and
a
great
love
of
the
truth
before
we
cast
doubts
upon
the
principles
which
assure
us
of
our
advantageous
position
but
a
serious
man
who
ponders
the
riddle
of
life
can
not
hesitate
to
begin
to
see
clearly
he
must
free
himself
from
his
superstitions
however
profitable
they
may
be
to
him
this
is
a
condition
quâ
to
have
no
superstition
to
force
oneself
into
the
attitude
of
a
child
or
a
descartes
this
superstition
of
modern
art
in
which
the
interested
castes
believe
this
gigantic
humbug
is
denounced
in
tolstoy
is
art
with
a
somewhat
ungentle
zest
he
holds
it
up
to
ridicule
and
exposes
its
hypocrisy
its
poverty
and
its
fundamental
corruption
he
makes
a
clean
sweep
of
everything
he
brings
to
this
work
of
demolition
the
joy
of
a
child
breaking
his
toys
the
whole
of
this
critical
portion
is
often
full
of
humour
but
sometimes
of
injustice
it
is
warfare
tolstoy
used
all
weapons
that
came
to
his
hand
and
struck
at
hazard
without
noticing
whom
he
struck
often
enough
it
happened
as
in
all
battles
that
he
wounded
those
whom
it
should
have
been
his
duty
to
defend
ibsen
or
beethoven
this
was
the
result
of
his
enthusiasm
which
left
him
no
time
to
reflect
before
acting
of
his
passion
which
often
blinded
him
to
the
weakness
of
his
reasons
and
let
us
say
it
it
was
also
the
result
of
his
incomplete
artistic
culture
setting
aside
his
literary
studies
what
could
he
well
know
of
contemporary
art
when
was
he
able
to
study
painting
and
what
could
he
have
heard
of
european
music
this
country
gentleman
who
had
passed
of
his
life
in
his
muscovite
village
and
who
had
not
visited
europe
since
and
what
did
he
see
when
he
was
upon
his
travels
except
the
schools
which
were
all
that
interested
him
he
speaks
of
paintings
from
hearsay
citing
among
the
decadents
such
painters
as
puvis
de
chavannes
manet
monet
böcklin
stuck
and
klinger
confidently
admiring
jules
breton
and
lhermitte
on
account
of
their
excellent
sentiments
despising
michelangelo
and
among
the
painters
of
the
soul
never
once
naming
rembrandt
in
music
he
felt
his
way
better
but
knew
hardly
anything
of
it
he
could
not
get
beyond
the
impressions
of
his
childhood
swore
by
those
who
were
already
classics
about
and
had
not
become
familiar
with
any
later
composers
excepting
tchaikowsky
whose
music
made
him
weep
he
throws
brahms
and
richard
strauss
into
the
bottom
of
the
same
bag
teaches
beethoven
his
business
and
in
order
to
judge
wagner
he
thought
it
was
sufficient
to
attend
a
single
representation
of
at
which
he
arrived
after
the
rise
of
the
curtain
while
he
left
in
the
middle
of
the
second
act
in
the
matter
of
literature
he
is
it
goes
without
saying
rather
better
informed
but
by
what
curious
aberration
did
he
evade
the
criticism
of
the
russian
writers
whom
he
knew
so
well
while
he
laid
down
the
law
to
foreign
poets
whose
temperament
was
as
far
as
possible
removed
from
his
own
and
whose
leaves
he
merely
turned
with
contemptuous
negligence
his
intrepid
assurance
increased
with
age
it
finally
impelled
him
to
write
a
book
for
the
purpose
of
proving
that
shakespeare
was
not
an
artist
he
may
have
been
no
matter
what
but
he
was
not
an
artist
his
certitude
is
admirable
tolstoy
does
not
doubt
he
does
not
discuss
the
truth
is
his
he
will
tell
you
the
ninth
symphony
is
a
work
which
causes
social
disunion
again
with
the
exception
of
the
celebrated
air
for
the
violin
by
bach
the
nocturne
in
e
flat
by
chopin
and
a
dozen
pieces
not
even
entire
chosen
from
among
the
works
of
haydn
mozart
weber
beethoven
and
chopin
all
the
rest
may
be
rejected
and
treated
with
contempt
as
examples
of
an
art
which
causes
social
disunion
again
i
am
going
to
prove
that
shakespeare
can
not
be
ranked
even
as
a
writer
of
the
fourth
order
and
as
a
he
is
nowhere
that
the
rest
of
humanity
is
of
a
different
opinion
is
no
reason
for
hesitating
on
the
contrary
my
opinion
he
proudly
says
is
entirely
different
from
the
established
opinion
concerning
shakespeare
throughout
europe
obsessed
by
his
hatred
of
lies
he
scents
untruth
everywhere
and
the
more
widely
an
idea
is
received
the
more
prickly
he
becomes
in
his
treatment
of
it
he
refuses
it
suspecting
in
it
as
he
says
with
reference
to
the
fame
of
shakespeare
one
of
those
epidemic
influences
to
which
men
have
always
been
subject
such
were
the
crusades
in
the
middle
ages
the
belief
in
witchcraft
the
search
for
the
philosopher
stone
and
the
passion
for
tulips
men
see
the
folly
of
these
influences
only
when
they
have
won
free
from
them
with
the
development
of
the
press
these
epidemics
have
become
particularly
notable
and
he
gives
as
an
example
the
most
recent
of
these
contagious
diseases
the
dreyfus
affair
of
which
he
the
enemy
of
all
injustice
the
defender
of
all
the
oppressed
speaks
with
disdainful
indifference
a
striking
example
of
the
excesses
into
which
he
is
drawn
by
his
suspicion
of
untruth
and
that
instinctive
hatred
of
moral
epidemics
of
which
he
admits
himself
the
victim
and
which
he
is
unable
to
master
it
is
the
reverse
side
of
a
virtue
this
inconceivable
blindness
of
the
seer
the
reader
of
souls
the
evoker
of
passionate
forces
which
leads
him
to
refer
to
as
an
inept
piece
of
work
and
to
the
proud
cordelia
as
a
characterless
creature
observe
that
he
sees
very
clearly
certain
of
shakespeare
actual
defects
faults
that
we
have
not
the
sincerity
to
admit
the
artificial
quality
of
the
poetic
diction
which
is
uniformly
attributed
to
all
his
characters
and
the
rhetoric
of
passion
of
heroism
and
even
of
simplicity
i
can
perfectly
well
understand
that
a
tolstoy
who
was
the
least
literary
of
writers
should
have
been
lacking
in
sympathy
for
the
art
of
one
who
was
the
most
genial
of
men
of
letters
but
why
waste
time
in
speaking
of
that
which
he
can
not
understand
what
is
the
worth
of
judgments
upon
a
world
which
is
closed
to
the
judge
nothing
if
we
seek
in
these
judgments
the
passport
to
these
unfamiliar
worlds
inestimably
great
if
we
seek
in
them
the
key
to
tolstoy
art
we
do
not
ask
of
a
creative
genius
the
impartiality
of
the
critic
when
a
wagner
or
a
tolstoy
speaks
of
beethoven
or
of
shakespeare
he
is
speaking
in
reality
not
of
beethoven
or
of
shakespeare
but
of
himself
he
is
revealing
his
own
ideals
they
do
not
even
try
to
put
us
off
the
scent
tolstoy
in
criticising
shakespeare
does
not
attempt
to
make
himself
objective
more
he
reproaches
shakespeare
for
his
objective
art
the
painter
of
and
the
master
of
impersonal
art
can
not
sufficiently
deride
those
german
critics
who
following
the
lead
of
goethe
invent
shakespeare
and
are
responsible
for
the
theory
that
art
ought
to
be
objective
that
is
to
say
ought
to
represent
human
beings
without
any
reference
to
moral
values
which
is
the
negation
of
the
religious
object
of
art
it
is
thus
from
the
pinnacle
of
a
creed
that
tolstoy
pronounces
his
artistic
judgments
we
must
not
look
for
any
personal
in
his
criticisms
we
shall
find
no
trace
of
such
a
thing
he
is
as
pitiless
to
his
own
works
as
to
those
of
others
what
then
does
he
really
intend
what
is
the
artistic
significance
of
the
religious
ideal
which
he
proposes
this
ideal
is
magnificent
the
term
religious
art
is
apt
to
mislead
one
as
to
the
breadth
of
the
conception
far
from
narrowing
the
province
of
art
tolstoy
enlarges
it
art
he
says
is
everywhere
art
creeps
into
our
whole
life
what
we
term
art
namely
theatres
concerts
books
exhibitions
is
only
an
infinitesimal
portion
of
art
our
life
is
full
of
artistic
manifestations
of
every
kind
from
the
games
of
children
to
the
offices
of
religion
art
and
speech
are
the
two
organs
of
human
progress
one
affords
the
communion
of
hearts
the
other
the
communion
of
thoughts
if
either
of
the
two
is
perverted
then
society
is
sick
the
art
of
is
perverted
since
the
renascence
it
has
no
longer
been
possible
to
speak
of
the
art
of
the
christian
nations
class
has
separated
itself
from
class
the
rich
the
privileged
have
attempted
to
claim
the
monopoly
of
art
and
they
have
made
their
pleasure
the
criterion
of
beauty
art
has
become
impoverished
as
it
has
grown
remoter
from
the
poor
the
category
of
the
emotions
experienced
by
those
who
do
not
work
in
order
to
live
is
far
more
limited
than
the
emotions
of
those
who
labour
the
sentiments
of
our
modern
society
may
be
reduced
to
three
pride
sensuality
and
weariness
of
life
these
three
sentiments
and
their
ramifications
constitute
almost
entirely
the
subject
of
the
art
of
the
wealthy
it
infects
the
world
perverts
the
people
propagates
sexual
depravity
and
has
become
the
worst
obstacle
to
the
realisation
of
human
happiness
it
is
also
devoid
of
real
beauty
unnatural
and
insincere
an
affected
fabricated
cerebral
art
in
the
face
of
this
lie
of
the
æsthetics
this
pastime
of
the
rich
let
us
raise
the
banner
of
the
living
human
art
the
art
which
unites
the
men
of
all
classes
and
all
nations
the
past
offers
us
glorious
examples
of
such
art
the
majority
of
mankind
has
always
understood
and
loved
that
which
we
consider
the
highest
art
the
epic
of
genesis
the
parables
of
the
gospel
the
legends
tales
and
songs
of
the
people
the
greatest
art
is
that
which
expresses
the
religious
conscience
of
the
period
by
this
tolstoy
does
not
mean
the
teaching
of
the
church
every
society
has
a
religious
conception
of
life
it
is
the
ideal
of
the
greatest
happiness
towards
which
that
society
tends
all
are
to
a
certain
extent
aware
of
this
tendency
a
few
pioneers
express
it
clearly
a
religious
conscience
always
exists
it
is
the
bed
in
which
the
river
flows
the
religious
consciousness
of
our
epoch
is
the
aspiration
toward
happiness
as
realised
by
the
fraternity
of
mankind
there
is
no
true
art
but
that
which
strives
for
this
union
the
highest
art
is
that
which
accomplishes
it
directly
by
the
power
of
love
but
there
is
another
art
which
participates
in
the
same
task
by
attacking
with
the
weapons
of
scorn
and
indignation
all
that
opposes
this
fraternity
such
are
the
novels
of
dickens
and
dostoyevsky
victor
hugo
and
the
paintings
of
millet
but
even
though
it
fail
to
attain
these
heights
all
art
which
represents
daily
life
with
sympathy
and
truth
brings
men
nearer
together
such
is
quixote
such
are
the
plays
of
molière
it
is
true
that
such
art
as
the
latter
is
continually
sinning
by
its
too
minute
realism
and
by
the
poverty
of
its
subjects
when
compared
with
ancient
models
such
as
the
sublime
history
of
joseph
the
excessive
minuteness
of
detail
is
detrimental
to
such
works
which
for
that
reason
can
not
become
universal
modern
works
of
art
are
spoiled
by
a
realism
which
might
more
justly
be
called
the
provincialism
of
art
thus
tolstoy
unhesitatingly
condemns
the
principle
of
his
own
genius
what
does
it
signify
to
him
that
he
should
sacrifice
himself
to
the
future
and
that
nothing
of
his
work
should
remain
the
art
of
the
future
will
not
be
a
development
of
the
art
of
the
present
it
will
be
founded
upon
other
bases
it
will
no
longer
be
the
property
of
a
caste
art
is
not
a
trade
or
profession
it
is
the
expression
of
real
feelings
now
the
artist
can
only
experience
real
feelings
when
he
refrains
from
isolating
himself
when
he
lives
the
life
natural
to
man
for
this
reason
the
man
who
is
sheltered
from
life
is
in
the
worst
possible
conditions
for
creative
work
in
the
future
artists
will
all
be
endowed
artistic
activity
will
be
made
accessible
to
all
by
the
introduction
into
the
elementary
schools
of
instruction
in
music
and
painting
which
will
be
taught
to
the
child
simultaneously
with
the
first
principles
of
grammar
for
the
rest
art
will
no
longer
call
for
a
complicated
technique
as
at
present
it
will
move
in
the
direction
of
simplicity
clearness
and
conciseness
which
are
the
marks
of
sane
and
classic
art
and
of
homeric
art
how
pleasant
it
will
be
to
translate
universal
sentiments
into
the
pure
lives
of
this
art
of
the
future
to
write
a
tale
or
a
song
to
design
a
picture
for
millions
of
beings
is
a
matter
of
much
greater
importance
and
of
much
greater
difficulty
than
writing
a
novel
or
a
symphony
it
is
an
immense
and
almost
virgin
province
thanks
to
such
works
men
will
learn
to
appreciate
the
happiness
of
brotherly
union
art
must
suppress
violence
and
only
art
can
do
so
its
mission
is
to
bring
about
the
kingdom
of
god
that
is
to
say
of
love
which
of
us
would
not
endorse
these
generous
words
and
who
can
fail
to
see
that
tolstoy
conception
is
fundamentally
fruitful
and
vital
in
spite
of
its
utopianism
and
a
touch
of
puerility
it
is
true
that
our
art
as
a
whole
is
only
the
expression
of
a
caste
which
is
itself
subdivided
not
only
by
the
fact
of
nationality
but
in
each
country
also
into
narrow
and
hostile
clans
there
is
not
a
single
artist
in
europe
who
realises
in
his
own
personality
the
union
of
parties
and
of
races
the
most
universal
mind
of
our
time
was
that
of
tolstoy
himself
in
him
men
of
all
nations
and
all
classes
have
attained
fraternity
and
those
who
have
tasted
the
virile
joy
of
this
capacious
love
can
no
longer
be
satisfied
by
the
shreds
and
fragments
of
the
vast
human
soul
which
are
offered
by
the
art
of
the
european
cliques
shall
we
do
in
time
he
even
came
to
justify
suffering
not
only
personal
suffering
but
the
sufferings
of
others
for
the
assuagement
of
the
sufferings
of
others
is
the
essence
of
the
rational
life
how
then
should
the
object
of
labour
be
an
object
of
suffering
for
the
labourer
it
is
as
though
the
labourer
were
to
say
that
an
untilled
field
is
a
grief
to
him

it
was
for

more
than
fourteen
years
i
shall
return
to
this
matter
when
speaking
of
the
his
intolerance
became
aggravated

reproached
contemporary
artists
for
daring
to
invoke
their
names
the
activity
of
a
galileo
a
shakespeare
a
beethoven
has
nothing
in
common
with
that
of
a
tyndall
a
victor
hugo
or
a
wagner
just
as
the
holy
father
would
deny
all
relationship
with
the
orthodox
popes
shall
we
do
for
that
matter
he
wished
to
leave
before
the
end
of
the
first
act
for
me
the
question
was
settled
i
had
no
more
doubt
there
was
nothing
to
be
expected
of
an
author
capable
of
imagining
scenes
like
these
one
could
affirm
beforehand
that
he
could
never
write
anything
that
was
not
evil
in
order
to
make
a
selection
from
the
french
poets
of
the
new
schools
he
conceived
the
admirable
idea
of
copying
in
each
volume
the
verses
printed
on
page
the
book
was
written
on
the
occasion
of
an
article
by
ernest
crosby
upon
and
the
working
here
was
one
of
those
incidents
which
often
occur
without
attracting
the
attention
of
any
one
and
without
interesting
i
do
not
say
the
world
but
even
the
french
military
world
and
further
on
it
was
not
until
some
years
had
passed
that
men
awoke
from
their
hypnosis
and
understood
that
they
could
not
possibly
know
whether
dreyfus
were
guilty
or
not
and
that
each
of
them
had
other
interests
more
important
and
more
immediate
than
the
affaire
dreyfus
is
a
very
poor
drama
very
carelessly
constructed
which
can
inspire
nothing
but
weariness
and
disgust
for
which
tolstoy
evinces
a
certain
sympathy
doubtless
because
the
work
is
in
harmony
with
his
ideas
of
that
time
concerning
marriage
and
jealousy
while
the
least
wretched
of
shakespeare
plays
is
only
a
tissue
of
emphatic
words
hamlet
has
no
character
at
all
he
is
the
author
phonograph
who
repeats
all
his
ideas
in
a
string
as
for
tempest
cymbeline
troilus
and
cressida
tolstoy
only
mentions
them
on
account
of
their
ineptitude
the
only
character
of
shakespeare
whom
he
finds
natural
is
falstaff
precisely
because
here
the
tongue
of
shakespeare
full
of
frigid
pleasantries
and
inept
puns
is
in
harmony
with
the
false
vain
debauched
character
of
this
repulsive
drunkard
tolstoy
had
not
always
been
of
this
opinion
he
read
shakespeare
with
pleasure
between
and
especially
at
the
time
when
he
contemplated
writing
a
historical
play
about
the
figure
of
peter
the
great
in
his
notes
for
we
find
that
he
even
takes
as
his
model
and
his
guide
having
mentioned
his
completed
works
and
comparing
and
to
the
homeric
ideal
he
adds
hamlet
and
my
future
works
the
poetry
of
the
in
the
depicting
of
character
he
classes
his
own
works
of
imagination
in
the
category
of
harmful
art
is
art
from
this
condemnation
he
does
not
except
his
own
plays
devoid
of
that
religious
conception
which
must
form
the
basis
of
the
drama
of
the
future
as
early
as
tolstoy
had
written
think
what
you
will
but
in
such
a
fashion
that
every
word
may
be
understood
by
every
one
one
can
not
write
anything
bad
in
a
perfectly
clear
and
simple
language
what
is
immoral
will
appear
so
false
if
clearly
expressed
that
it
will
assuredly
be
deleted
if
a
writer
seriously
wishes
to
speak
to
the
people
he
has
only
to
force
himself
to
be
comprehensible
when
not
a
word
arrests
the
reader
attention
the
work
is
good
if
he
can
not
relate
what
he
has
read
the
work
is
worthless
this
ideal
of
brotherhood
and
union
among
men
is
by
no
means
to
tolstoy
mind
the
limit
of
human
activity
his
insatiable
mind
conceives
an
unknown
ideal
above
and
beyond
that
of
love
science
will
perhaps
one
day
offer
as
the
basis
of
art
a
much
higher
ideal
and
art
will
realise
it
chapter
xiv
theories
of
art
music
the
finest
theory
finds
its
value
only
in
the
works
by
which
it
is
exemplified
with
tolstoy
theory
and
creation
are
always
hand
in
hand
like
faith
and
action
while
he
was
elaborating
his
critique
of
art
he
was
producing
types
of
the
new
art
of
which
he
spoke
of
two
forms
of
art
one
higher
and
one
less
exalted
but
both
religious
in
the
most
human
sense
in
one
he
sought
the
union
of
men
through
love
in
the
other
he
waged
war
upon
the
world
the
enemy
of
love
it
was
during
this
period
that
he
wrote
those
masterpieces
death
of
ivan
the
tales
and
power
of
the
and
and
at
the
height
and
end
of
this
artistic
period
like
a
cathedral
with
two
spires
the
one
symbolising
eternal
love
and
the
other
the
hatred
of
the
world
stands
all
these
works
are
distinguished
from
their
predecessors
by
new
artistic
qualities
tolstoy
ideas
had
suffered
a
change
not
alone
in
respect
of
the
object
of
art
but
also
in
respect
of
its
form
in
reading
is
art
or
we
are
struck
by
the
principles
of
art
which
tolstoy
has
enounced
in
these
two
books
for
these
principles
are
for
the
most
part
in
contradiction
to
the
greatest
of
his
previous
works
clearness
simplicity
conciseness
we
read
in
is
art
material
effects
are
despised
minute
realism
is
condemned
and
in
the
classic
ideal
of
perfection
and
proportion
is
upheld
without
the
feeling
of
balance
no
artists
could
exist
and
although
in
his
new
work
the
unregenerate
man
with
his
genius
for
analysis
and
his
native
savagery
is
not
entirely
effaced
some
aspects
of
the
latter
quality
being
even
emphasised
his
art
is
profoundly
modified
in
some
respects
the
design
is
clearer
more
vigorously
accented
the
minds
of
his
characters
are
epitomised
foreshortened
the
interior
drama
is
intensified
gathered
upon
itself
like
a
beast
of
prey
about
to
spring
the
emotion
has
a
quality
of
universality
and
is
freed
of
all
transitory
details
of
local
realism
and
finally
the
diction
is
rich
in
illustrations
racy
and
smacking
of
the
soil
his
love
of
the
people
had
long
led
him
to
appreciate
the
beauty
of
the
popular
idiom
as
a
child
he
had
been
soothed
by
the
tales
of
mendicant
as
a
grown
man
and
a
famous
writer
he
experienced
an
artistic
delight
in
chatting
with
his
peasants
these
men
he
said
in
later
years
to
paul
boyer
are
masters
of
old
when
i
used
to
talk
with
them
or
with
the
wanderers
who
wallet
on
shoulder
pass
through
our
countryside
i
used
carefully
to
note
such
of
their
expressions
as
i
heard
for
the
first
time
expressions
often
forgotten
by
our
modern
literary
dialect
but
always
good
old
russian
currency
ringing
sound
yes
the
genius
of
the
language
lives
in
these
men
he
must
have
been
the
more
sensitive
to
such
elements
of
the
language
in
that
his
mind
was
not
encumbered
with
literature
through
living
far
from
any
city
in
the
midst
of
peasants
he
came
to
think
a
little
in
the
manner
of
the
people
he
had
the
slow
dialectic
the
common
sense
which
reasons
slowly
and
painfully
step
by
step
with
sudden
disconcerting
leaps
the
mania
for
repeating
any
idea
when
he
was
once
convinced
of
repeating
it
unwearingly
and
indefinitely
and
in
the
same
words
but
these
were
faults
rather
than
qualities
it
was
many
years
before
he
became
aware
of
the
latent
genius
of
the
popular
tongue
the
raciness
of
its
images
its
poetic
crudity
its
wealth
of
legendary
wisdom
even
at
the
time
of
writing
and
he
was
already
subject
to
its
influence
in
march
he
wrote
to
strakov
i
have
altered
the
method
of
my
diction
and
my
writing
the
language
of
the
people
has
sounds
to
express
all
that
the
poet
can
say
and
it
is
very
dear
to
me
it
is
the
best
poetic
regulator
if
you
try
to
say
anything
superfluous
too
emphatic
or
false
the
language
will
not
suffer
it
whereas
our
literary
tongue
has
no
skeleton
you
may
pull
it
about
in
every
direction
and
the
result
is
always
something
resembling
literature
to
the
people
he
owed
not
only
models
of
style
he
owed
them
many
of
his
inspirations
in
a
teller
of
came
to
yasnaya
polyana
and
tolstoy
took
notes
of
several
of
his
stories
of
the
number
was
the
legend
what
do
men
live
and
three
old
which
became
as
we
know
two
of
the
finest
of
the
tales
and
which
tolstoy
published
a
few
years
later
this
is
a
work
unique
in
modern
art
it
is
higher
than
art
for
who
in
reading
it
thinks
of
literature
the
spirit
of
the
gospel
and
the
pure
love
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
are
combined
with
the
smiling
geniality
of
the
wisdom
of
the
people
it
is
full
of
simplicity
limpidity
and
ineffable
goodness
of
heart
and
that
supernatural
radiance
which
from
time
to
time
so
naturally
and
inevitably
bathes
the
whole
picture
surrounding
the
old
elias
like
a
halo
or
hovering
in
the
cabin
of
the
cobbler
michael
he
who
through
his
skylight
on
the
sees
the
feet
of
people
passing
and
whom
the
lord
visits
in
the
guise
of
the
poor
whom
the
good
cobbler
has
succoured
sometimes
in
these
tales
the
parables
of
the
gospel
are
mingled
with
a
vague
perfume
of
oriental
legends
of
those
and
one
which
tolstoy
had
loved
since
childhood
sometimes
again
the
fantastic
light
takes
on
a
sinister
aspect
lending
the
tale
a
terrifying
majesty
such
is
the
the
tale
of
the
man
who
kills
himself
in
acquiring
a
great
surface
of
and
all
the
land
which
he
can
encircle
by
walking
for
a
whole
day
and
who
dies
on
completing
his
journey
on
the
hill
the
sitting
on
the
ground
watched
him
as
he
ran
and
he
cackled
holding
his
stomach
with
both
hands
and
pakhom
fell
well
done
my
merry
fellow
you
have
won
a
mighty
lot
of
land
the
rose
and
threw
a
mattock
to
pakhom
servant
he
is
bury
him
the
servant
was
alone
he
dug
a
ditch
for
pakhom
just
as
long
as
from
his
feet
to
his
head
two
yards
and
he
buried
him
nearly
all
these
tales
conceal
beneath
their
poetic
envelope
the
same
evangelical
moral
of
renunciation
and
pardon
do
not
avenge
thyself
upon
whosoever
shall
offend
thee
do
not
resist
whosoever
shall
do
thee
evil
vengeance
is
mine
saith
the
lord
and
everywhere
and
as
the
conclusion
of
all
is
love
tolstoy
who
wished
to
found
an
art
for
all
men
achieved
universality
at
the
first
stroke
throughout
the
world
his
work
has
met
with
a
success
which
can
never
fail
for
it
is
purged
of
all
the
perishable
elements
of
art
and
nothing
is
left
but
the
eternal
power
of
does
not
rise
to
this
august
simplicity
of
heart
it
does
not
pretend
to
do
so
it
is
the
reverse
side
of
the
picture
on
the
one
hand
is
the
dream
of
divine
love
on
the
other
the
ghastly
reality
we
may
judge
in
reading
this
play
whether
faith
and
his
love
of
the
people
ever
caused
him
to
idealise
the
people
or
betray
the
truth
tolstoy
so
awkward
in
most
of
his
dramatic
essays
has
here
attained
to
mastery
the
characters
and
the
action
are
handled
with
ease
the
coxcomb
nikita
the
sensual
headstrong
passion
of
anissia
the
cynical
of
the
old
woman
matrena
who
gloats
maternally
over
the
adultery
of
her
son
and
the
sanctity
of
the
old
stammering
hakim
god
inhabiting
a
ridiculous
body
then
comes
the
fall
of
nikita
weak
and
without
real
evil
but
fettered
by
his
sin
falling
to
the
depths
of
crime
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
check
himself
on
the
dreadful
declivity
but
his
mother
and
his
wife
drag
him
downward
the
peasants
are
worth
much
but
the
the
women
they
are
wild
animals
they
are
afraid
of
nothing
sisters
there
are
millions
of
you
all
russians
and
you
are
all
as
blind
as
moles
you
know
nothing
you
know
nothing
the
moujik
at
least
may
manage
to
learn
something
in
the
or
who
knows
where
in
prison
or
in
the
barracks
but
the
what
can
she
know
she
has
seen
nothing
heard
nothing
as
she
has
grown
up
so
she
will
die
they
are
like
little
blind
puppies
who
go
running
here
and
there
and
ramming
their
heads
against
all
sorts
of
filth
they
only
know
their
silly
songs
o
o
ho
o
o
what
does
it
mean
ho
o
o
they
do
know
then
comes
the
terrible
scene
of
the
murder
of
the
child
nikita
does
not
want
to
kill
it
anissia
who
has
murdered
her
husband
for
him
and
whose
nerves
have
ever
since
been
tortured
by
her
crime
becomes
ferocious
maddened
and
threatens
to
give
him
up
she
cries
at
least
i
sha
be
alone
any
longer
he
be
a
murderer
too
let
him
know
what
it
like
nikita
crushes
the
child
between
two
boards
in
the
midst
of
his
crime
he
flies
terrified
he
threatens
to
kill
anissia
and
his
mother
he
sobs
he
prays
little
mother
i
ca
go
on
he
thinks
he
hears
the
mangled
baby
crying
where
shall
i
go
to
be
safe
it
is
shakespearean
less
violent
but
still
more
poignant
is
the
dialogue
of
the
little
girl
and
the
old
who
alone
in
the
house
at
night
hear
and
guess
at
the
crime
which
is
being
enacted
off
the
stage
the
end
is
voluntary
expiation
nikita
accompanied
by
his
father
the
old
hakim
enters
barefooted
in
the
midst
of
a
wedding
he
kneels
asks
pardon
of
all
and
accuses
himself
of
every
crime
old
hakim
encourages
him
looks
upon
him
with
a
smile
of
ecstatic
suffering
god
oh
look
at
him
god
the
drama
gains
quite
a
special
artistic
flavour
by
the
use
of
the
peasant
dialect
i
ransacked
my
notebooks
in
order
to
write
power
of
tolstoy
told
paul
boyer
the
unexpected
images
flowing
from
the
lyrical
yet
humorous
soul
of
the
russian
people
have
a
swing
and
a
vigour
about
them
beside
which
images
of
the
more
literary
quality
seem
tame
and
colourless
tolstoy
revelled
in
them
we
feel
in
reading
the
play
that
the
artist
while
writing
it
amused
himself
by
noting
these
expressions
these
turns
of
thought
the
comic
side
of
them
by
no
means
escapes
him
even
while
the
apostle
is
mourning
amidst
the
dark
places
of
the
human
soul
while
he
was
studying
the
people
and
sending
into
their
darkness
a
ray
of
light
from
his
station
above
them
he
was
also
devoting
two
tragic
romances
to
the
still
darker
night
of
the
middle
classes
and
the
wealthy
at
this
period
the
dramatic
form
was
predominant
over
his
ideas
of
art
the
of
ivan
and
kreutzer
are
both
true
dramas
of
the
inner
soul
of
the
soul
turned
upon
itself
and
concentrated
upon
itself
and
in
kreutzer
it
is
the
hero
of
the
drama
himself
who
unfolds
it
by
narration
death
of
ivan
has
impressed
the
french
public
as
few
russian
works
have
done
at
the
beginning
of
this
study
i
mentioned
that
i
had
witnessed
the
sensation
caused
by
this
book
among
the
readers
in
the
french
provinces
a
class
apparently
indifferent
to
literature
and
art
i
think
the
explanation
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
book
represents
with
a
painful
realism
a
type
of
the
average
mediocre
man
a
conscientious
functionary
without
religion
without
ideals
almost
without
thought
the
man
who
is
absorbed
in
his
duties
in
his
mechanical
life
until
the
hour
of
his
death
when
he
sees
with
terror
that
he
has
not
lived
ivan
ilyitch
is
the
representative
type
of
the
european
of
which
reads
zola
goes
to
hear
bernhardt
and
without
holding
any
faith
is
not
even
irreligious
for
it
does
not
take
the
trouble
either
to
believe
or
to
disbelieve
it
simply
never
thinks
of
such
matters
in
the
violence
of
its
attacks
alternately
bitter
and
almost
comic
upon
the
world
in
general
and
marriage
in
particular
the
of
ivan
was
the
first
of
a
new
series
of
works
it
was
the
forerunner
of
the
still
more
morose
and
unworldly
and
there
is
a
lamentable
yet
laughable
emptiness
in
this
life
as
there
is
in
thousands
and
thousands
of
lives
with
its
grotesque
ambitions
its
wretched
gratification
of
vanity
always
better
than
spending
the
evening
opposite
one
wife
with
its
weariness
and
hatred
of
the
official
career
its
privileges
and
the
embitterment
which
they
cause
and
its
one
real
pleasure
whist
this
ridiculous
life
is
lost
for
a
cause
yet
more
ridiculous
a
fall
from
a
ladder
one
day
when
ivan
wished
to
hang
a
curtain
over
the
window
the
lie
of
life
the
lie
of
sickness
the
lie
of
the
doctor
who
thinks
only
of
himself
the
lie
of
the
family
whom
illness
disgusts
the
lie
of
the
wife
who
professes
devotion
and
calculates
how
she
will
live
when
her
husband
is
dead
the
universal
lie
against
which
is
set
only
the
truth
of
a
compassionate
servant
who
does
not
try
to
conceal
his
condition
from
the
dying
man
and
helps
him
out
of
brotherly
kindness
ivan
ilyitch
full
of
an
infinite
pity
for
himself
weeps
over
his
loneliness
and
the
egoism
of
men
he
suffers
horribly
until
the
day
on
which
he
perceives
that
his
past
life
has
been
a
lie
and
that
he
can
repair
that
lie
immediately
all
becomes
clear
an
hour
before
his
death
he
no
longer
thinks
of
himself
he
thinks
of
his
family
he
pities
them
he
die
and
rid
them
of
himself
where
are
you
pain
here
well
you
have
only
to
and
death
where
is
death
he
did
not
find
it
in
place
of
death
he
saw
only
a
ray
of
light
is
over
said
some
he
heard
these
words
and
repeated
them
to
himself
no
longer
exists
he
told
himself
in
kreutzer
there
is
not
even
this
ray
of
light
it
is
a
ferocious
piece
of
work
tolstoy
lashes
out
at
society
like
a
wounded
beast
avenging
itself
for
what
it
has
suffered
we
must
not
forget
that
the
story
is
the
confession
of
a
human
brute
who
has
taken
life
and
who
is
poisoned
by
the
virus
of
jealousy
tolstoy
hides
himself
behind
his
leading
character
we
certainly
find
his
own
ideas
though
heightened
in
tone
in
these
furious
invectives
against
hypocrisy
in
general
the
hypocrisy
of
the
education
of
women
of
love
of
marriage
marriage
that
domestic
prostitution
the
hypocrisy
of
the
world
of
science
of
physicians
those
sowers
of
crime
but
the
hero
of
the
book
impels
the
writer
into
an
extraordinary
brutality
of
expression
a
violent
rush
of
carnal
images
all
the
excesses
of
a
luxurious
body
and
by
reaction
into
all
the
fury
of
asceticism
the
fear
and
hatred
of
the
passions
maledictions
hurled
in
the
face
of
life
by
a
monk
of
the
middle
ages
consumed
with
sensuality
having
written
the
book
tolstoy
himself
was
alarmed
i
never
foresaw
at
all
he
said
in
the
to
the
kreutzer
that
in
writing
this
book
a
rigorous
logic
would
bring
me
where
i
have
arrived
my
own
conclusions
terrified
me
at
first
and
i
was
tempted
to
reject
them
but
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
refuse
to
hear
the
voice
of
my
reason
and
my
conscience
he
found
himself
repeating
in
calmer
tones
the
savage
outcry
of
the
murderer
posdnicheff
against
love
and
marriage
he
who
regards
woman
above
all
his
wife
with
sensuality
already
commits
adultery
with
her
when
the
passions
have
disappeared
then
humanity
will
no
longer
have
a
reason
for
being
it
will
have
executed
the
law
the
union
of
mankind
will
be
accomplished
he
will
prove
on
the
authority
of
the
gospel
according
to
matthew
that
the
christian
ideal
is
not
marriage
that
christian
marriage
can
not
exist
that
marriage
from
the
christian
point
of
view
is
an
element
not
of
progress
but
of
downfall
that
love
with
all
that
precedes
and
follows
it
is
an
obstacle
to
the
true
human
ideal
but
he
had
never
formulated
these
ideas
clearly
even
to
himself
until
they
fell
from
the
lips
of
posdnicheff
as
often
happens
with
great
creative
artists
the
work
carried
the
writer
with
it
the
artist
outstripped
the
thinker
a
process
by
which
art
lost
nothing
in
the
power
of
its
effects
in
passionate
concentration
in
the
brutal
vividness
of
its
impressions
and
in
fullness
and
maturity
of
form
nothing
tolstoy
has
written
equals
the
i
have
not
explained
the
title
to
be
exact
it
is
erroneous
it
gives
a
false
idea
of
the
book
in
which
music
plays
only
an
accessory
part
suppress
the
sonata
and
all
would
be
the
same
tolstoy
made
the
mistake
of
confusing
two
matters
both
of
which
he
took
deeply
to
heart
the
depraving
power
of
music
and
the
depraving
power
of
love
the
demon
of
music
should
have
been
dealt
with
in
a
separate
volume
the
space
which
tolstoy
has
accorded
it
in
the
work
in
question
is
insufficient
to
prove
the
danger
which
he
wishes
to
denounce
i
must
emphasise
this
matter
somewhat
for
i
do
not
think
the
attitude
of
tolstoy
in
respect
of
music
has
ever
been
fully
understood
he
was
far
from
disliking
music
only
the
things
one
loves
are
feared
as
tolstoy
feared
the
power
of
music
remember
what
a
place
the
memories
of
music
hold
in
and
above
all
in
happiness
in
which
the
whole
cycle
of
love
from
its
springtide
to
its
autumn
is
unrolled
to
the
phrases
of
the
quasi
una
of
beethoven
remember
too
the
wonderful
symphonies
which
nekhludov
hears
in
fancy
and
the
little
petia
the
night
before
his
death
although
tolstoy
had
studied
music
very
indifferently
it
used
to
move
him
to
tears
and
at
certain
periods
of
his
life
he
passionately
abandoned
himself
to
its
influence
in
he
founded
a
musical
society
which
in
later
years
became
the
moscow
conservatoire
he
was
extremely
fond
of
music
writes
his
bers
he
used
to
play
the
piano
and
was
fond
of
the
classic
masters
he
would
often
sit
down
to
the
piano
before
beginning
his
work
probably
he
found
inspiration
in
so
doing
he
always
used
to
accompany
my
youngest
sister
whose
voice
he
loved
i
have
noticed
that
the
sensations
which
the
music
evoked
in
him
were
accompanied
by
a
slight
pallor
and
an
imperceptible
grimace
which
seemed
expressive
of
fear
it
was
really
fear
that
he
felt
fear
inspired
by
the
stress
of
those
unknown
forces
which
shook
him
to
the
roots
of
his
being
in
the
world
of
music
he
felt
his
moral
will
his
reason
and
all
the
reality
of
life
dissolve
let
us
turn
to
the
scene
in
the
first
volume
of
and
in
which
nikolas
rostoff
who
has
just
lost
heavily
at
cards
returns
in
a
state
of
despair
he
hears
his
sister
natasha
singing
he
forgets
everything
he
waited
with
a
feverish
impatience
for
the
note
which
was
about
to
follow
and
for
a
moment
the
only
thing
in
all
the
world
was
the
melody
in
mio
crudele
affetto
an
absurd
existence
ours
is
he
thought
money
hatred
honour
they
are
all
nothing
here
is
the
truth
the
reality
natasha
my
little
dove
let
us
see
if
she
is
going
to
reach
that
b
she
has
reached
it
thank
god
and
to
emphasise
the
b
he
sung
the
third
octave
below
it
in
accompaniment
splendid
i
have
sung
it
too
he
cried
and
the
vibration
of
that
octave
awoke
in
his
soul
all
that
was
best
and
purest
beside
this
superhuman
sensation
what
were
his
losses
at
play
and
his
word
of
honour
follies
one
could
kill
steal
and
yet
be
happy
nikolas
neither
kills
nor
steals
and
for
him
music
is
only
a
passing
influence
but
natasha
is
on
the
point
of
losing
her
after
an
evening
at
the
opera
in
that
strange
world
which
is
intoxicated
and
perverted
by
art
and
a
thousand
leagues
from
the
real
world
a
world
in
which
good
and
evil
the
extravagant
and
the
reasonable
are
mingled
and
confounded
she
listened
to
a
declaration
from
anatol
kouraguin
who
was
madly
in
love
with
her
and
she
consented
to
elope
with
him
the
older
tolstoy
grew
the
more
he
feared
music
a
man
whose
influence
over
him
was
considerable
auerbach
whom
in
he
had
met
in
dresden
had
doubtless
a
hand
in
fortifying
his
prejudices
he
spoke
of
music
as
of
a
a
profligate
amusement
according
to
him
it
was
an
incentive
to
depravity
among
so
many
musicians
some
of
whose
music
is
at
least
amoral
why
asks
camille
bellaigue
should
tolstoy
have
chosen
beethoven
the
purest
the
chastest
of
all
because
he
was
the
most
powerful
tolstoy
had
early
loved
his
music
and
he
always
loved
it
his
remotest
memories
of
were
connected
with
the
pathétique
and
when
nekhludov
in
heard
the
of
the
in
c
he
could
hardly
restrain
his
tears
he
was
filled
with
tenderness
for
himself
and
for
those
he
loved
yet
we
have
seen
with
what
animosity
tolstoy
referred
in
his
is
art
to
the
unhealthy
works
of
the
deaf
beethoven
and
even
in
the
fury
with
which
he
delighted
in
demolishing
beethoven
and
in
casting
doubts
upon
his
genius
had
revolted
tchaikowsky
and
had
diminished
his
admiration
for
tolstoy
the
enables
us
to
plumb
the
depths
of
this
passionate
injustice
what
does
tolstoy
complain
of
in
beethoven
of
his
power
he
reminds
us
of
goethe
listening
to
the
in
c
he
is
overwhelmed
by
it
and
angrily
turns
upon
the
imperious
master
who
subjects
him
against
his
will
this
music
says
tolstoy
transports
me
immediately
into
the
state
of
mind
which
was
the
composer
when
he
wrote
it
music
ought
to
be
a
state
matter
as
in
china
we
ought
not
to
let
tom
dick
and
harry
wield
so
frightful
a
hypnotic
power
as
for
these
things
the
first
of
the
sonata
one
ought
only
to
be
allowed
to
play
them
under
particular
and
important
circumstances
yet
we
see
after
this
revolt
how
he
surrenders
to
the
power
of
beethoven
and
how
this
power
is
by
his
own
admission
a
pure
and
ennobling
force
on
hearing
the
piece
in
question
posdnicheff
falls
into
an
indefinable
state
of
mind
which
he
can
not
analyse
but
of
which
the
consciousness
fills
him
with
delight
there
is
no
longer
room
for
jealousy
the
wife
is
not
less
transfigured
she
has
while
she
plays
a
majestic
severity
of
expression
and
a
faint
smile
compassionate
and
happy
after
she
has
finished
what
is
there
perverse
in
all
this
this
that
the
spirit
is
enslaved
that
the
unknown
power
of
sound
can
do
with
him
what
it
wills
destroy
him
if
it
please
this
is
true
but
tolstoy
forgets
one
thing
the
mediocrity
and
the
lack
of
vitality
in
the
majority
of
those
who
make
or
listen
to
music
music
can
not
be
dangerous
to
those
who
feel
nothing
the
spectacle
of
the
during
a
performance
of
is
quite
enough
to
assure
us
of
the
immunity
of
the
public
to
the
more
perverse
emotions
evoked
by
the
art
of
sounds
to
be
in
danger
one
must
be
like
tolstoy
abounding
in
life
the
truth
is
that
in
spite
of
his
injustice
where
beethoven
was
concerned
tolstoy
felt
his
music
more
deeply
than
do
the
majority
of
those
who
now
exalt
him
he
at
least
knew
the
frenzied
passions
the
savage
violence
which
mutter
through
the
art
of
the
deaf
old
man
but
of
which
the
orchestras
and
the
virtuosi
of
are
innocent
beethoven
would
perhaps
have
preferred
the
hatred
of
tolstoy
to
the
enthusiasm
of
his
admirers
to
these
years
was
attributed
in
respect
of
the
date
of
publication
and
perhaps
of
completion
a
work
which
was
really
written
during
the
happy
period
of
betrothal
and
the
first
years
of
marriage
the
beautiful
story
of
a
horse
tolstoy
speaks
of
it
in
in
a
letter
to
fet
the
art
of
the
commencement
with
its
fine
landscapes
its
penetrating
psychological
sympathy
its
humour
and
its
youth
has
much
in
common
with
the
art
of
tolstoy
maturity
happiness
war
and
the
quality
of
the
end
and
the
last
pages
comparing
the
body
of
the
old
horse
with
that
of
his
master
are
full
of
a
realistic
brutality
characteristic
of
the
years
after

as
for
style
his
friend
droujinin
told
him
in
you
are
extremely
illiterate
sometimes
like
an
innovator

that

real
pleasure
is
admirable

a
french
translation
of
this
epilogue
by
was
published
in
the
volume
under
the
title
relations
entre
les
let
us
take
notice
that
tolstoy
was
never
guilty
of
the
simplicity
of
believing
that
the
ideal
of
celibacy
and
absolute
chastity
was
capable
of
realisation
by
humanity
as
we
know
it
but
according
to
him
an
ideal
is
incapable
of
realisation
by
its
very
definition
it
is
an
appeal
to
the
heroic
energies
of
the
soul
the
conception
of
the
christian
ideal
which
is
the
union
of
all
living
creatures
in
brotherly
love
is
irreconcilable
with
the
conduct
of
life
which
demands
a
continual
effort
towards
an
ideal
which
is
inaccessible
but
does
not
expect
that
it
will
ever
be
attained
at
the
end
of
russian
and
i
do
not
mention
the
story
of
a
musician
of
genius
the

is

extreme

period
spoken
of

in
a
sense
the
artistic
testament
of
the
author
it
dominates
the
end
of
his
life
as
and
crowned
its
maturity
it
is
the
last
peak
perhaps
the
highest
if
not
the
most
stupendous
whose
invisible
summit
is
lost
in
the
mists
tolstoy
is
seventy
years
old
he
contemplates
the
world
his
life
his
past
mistakes
his
faith
his
righteous
anger
he
sees
them
from
a
height
we
find
the
same
ideals
as
in
his
previous
books
the
same
warring
upon
hypocrisy
but
the
spirit
of
the
artist
as
in
and
soars
above
his
subject
to
the
sombre
irony
the
mental
tumult
of
the
and
death
of
ivan
he
adds
a
religious
serenity
a
detachment
from
the
world
which
is
faithfully
reflected
in
himself
one
is
reminded
at
times
of
a
christian
goethe
all
the
literary
characteristics
which
we
have
noted
in
the
works
of
his
later
period
are
to
be
found
here
and
of
these
especially
the
concentration
of
the
narrative
which
is
even
more
striking
in
a
long
novel
than
in
a
short
story
there
is
a
wonderful
unity
about
the
book
in
which
respect
it
differs
widely
from
and
and
there
are
hardly
any
digressions
of
an
episodic
nature
a
single
train
of
action
tenaciously
followed
is
worked
out
in
every
detail
there
is
the
same
vigorous
portraiture
the
same
ease
and
fullness
of
handling
as
in
the
the
observation
is
more
than
ever
lucid
robust
pitilessly
realistic
revealing
the
animal
in
the
man
the
terrible
persistence
of
the
beast
in
man
more
terrible
when
this
animality
is
not
openly
obvious
when
it
is
concealed
under
a
poetical
exterior
witness
the
conversations
which
have
for
their
object
the
mere
satisfaction
of
a
physical
need
the
need
of
stimulating
the
digestion
by
moving
the
muscles
of
the
tongue
and
gullet
the
crude
vision
of
humanity
which
spares
no
one
neither
the
pretty
korchagina
with
her
two
false
teeth
the
salient
bones
of
her
elbows
and
the
largeness
of
her
and
her
which
inspires
in
nekhludov
a
feeling
of
shame
and
disgust
disgust
and
shame
nor
the
herione
maslova
nothing
of
whose
degradation
is
hidden
her
look
of
premature
age
her
vicious
ignoble
expression
her
provocative
smile
the
odour
of
brandy
that
hangs
about
her
her
red
and
swollen
face
there
is
a
brutality
of
naturalistic
detail
as
instance
the
woman
who
converses
while
crouched
over
the
commode
youth
and
the
poetic
imagination
have
vanished
except
in
the
passages
which
deal
with
the
memories
of
first
love
whose
music
vibrates
in
the
reader
mind
with
hypnotic
intensity
the
night
of
the
holy
saturday
and
the
night
of
passover
the
thaw
the
white
mist
so
thick
that
at
five
paces
from
the
house
one
saw
nothing
but
a
shadowy
mass
whence
glimmered
the
red
light
of
a
lamp
the
crowing
of
the
cocks
in
the
night
the
sounds
from
the
frozen
river
where
the
ice
cracks
snores
bubbles
and
tinkles
like
a
breaking
glass
and
the
young
man
who
from
the
night
outside
looks
through
the
window
at
the
young
girl
who
does
not
see
him
seated
near
the
table
in
the
flickering
light
of
the
little
lamp
katusha
pensive
dreaming
and
smiling
at
her
dreams
the
lyrical
powers
of
the
writer
are
given
but
little
play
his
art
has
become
more
impersonal
more
alien
to
his
own
life
the
world
of
criminals
and
revolutionaries
which
he
here
describes
was
unfamiliar
to
him
he
enters
it
only
by
an
effort
of
voluntary
sympathy
he
even
admits
that
before
studying
them
at
close
quarters
the
revolutionaries
inspired
him
with
an
unconquerable
aversion
all
the
more
admirable
is
his
impeccable
observation
a
faultless
mirror
what
a
wealth
of
types
of
precise
details
how
everything
is
baseness
and
virtue
without
hardness
without
weakness
but
with
a
serene
understanding
and
a
brotherly
pity
the
terrible
picture
of
the
women
in
the
prison
they
are
pitiless
to
one
another
but
the
artist
is
the
merciful
god
he
sees
in
the
heart
of
each
the
distress
that
hides
beneath
humiliation
and
the
tearful
eyes
beneath
the
mask
of
effrontery
the
pure
faint
light
which
little
by
little
waxes
within
the
vicious
mind
of
maslova
and
at
last
illumines
her
with
a
sacrificial
flame
has
the
touching
beauty
of
one
of
those
rays
of
sunshine
which
transfigure
some
humble
scene
painted
by
the
brush
of
rembrandt
there
is
no
severity
here
even
for
the
warders
and
executioners
lord
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
the
worst
of
it
is
that
often
they
do
know
what
they
do
they
feel
all
the
pangs
of
remorse
yet
they
can
not
do
otherwise
there
broods
over
the
book
the
sense
of
the
crushing
and
inevitable
fatality
which
weighs
upon
those
who
suffer
and
those
who
cause
that
suffering
the
director
of
the
prison
full
of
natural
kindness
as
sick
of
his
jailer
life
as
of
the
pianoforte
exercises
of
the
pale
sickly
daughter
with
the
dark
circles
beneath
her
eyes
who
indefatigably
murders
a
rhapsody
of
liszt
the
of
the
siberian
town
intelligent
and
kindly
who
in
the
hope
of
escaping
the
inevitable
conflict
between
the
good
he
wishes
to
do
and
the
evil
he
is
forced
to
do
has
been
steadily
drinking
since
the
age
of
who
is
always
sufficiently
master
of
himself
to
keep
up
appearances
even
when
he
is
drunk
and
among
these
people
we
find
the
ordinary
affection
for
wife
and
children
although
their
calling
renders
them
pitiless
in
respect
of
the
rest
of
humanity
the
only
character
in
this
book
who
has
no
objective
reality
is
nekhludov
himself
and
this
is
so
because
tolstoy
has
invested
him
with
his
own
ideas
this
is
a
defect
of
several
of
the
most
notable
types
in
and
and
in
for
example
prince
andrei
pierre
besoukhov
levine
and
others
the
fault
was
less
grave
however
in
these
earlier
books
for
the
characters
by
force
of
their
circumstances
and
their
age
were
nearer
to
the
actual
state
of
mind
but
in
the
author
places
in
the
body
of
an
epicurean
of
the
disembodied
soul
of
an
old
man
of
seventy
i
will
not
say
that
the
moral
crisis
through
which
nekhludov
is
supposed
to
pass
is
absolutely
untrue
and
impossible
nor
even
that
it
could
not
be
brought
about
so
suddenly
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
temperament
the
character
the
previous
life
of
the
man
as
tolstoy
depicts
him
to
announce
or
explain
this
crisis
and
once
it
has
commenced
nothing
interrupts
it
tolstoy
has
it
is
true
with
profound
observation
represented
the
impure
alloy
which
at
the
outset
is
mingled
with
the
thoughts
of
sacrifice
the
tears
of
and
admiration
and
later
the
horror
and
repugnance
which
seize
upon
nekhludov
when
he
is
brought
face
to
face
with
reality
but
his
resolution
never
flinches
this
crisis
has
nothing
in
common
with
his
previous
crises
violent
but
only
momentary
henceforth
nothing
can
arrest
this
weak
and
undecided
character
a
wealthy
prince
much
respected
greatly
enjoying
the
good
things
of
the
world
on
the
point
of
marrying
a
charming
girl
who
loves
him
and
is
not
distasteful
to
him
he
suddenly
decides
to
abandon
everything
wealth
the
world
and
social
position
and
to
marry
a
prostitute
in
order
to
atone
for
a
remote
offence
and
his
exaltation
survives
without
flinching
for
months
it
holds
out
against
every
trial
even
the
news
that
the
woman
he
wishes
to
make
his
wife
is
continuing
her
life
of
debauchery
here
we
have
a
saintliness
of
which
the
psychology
of
a
dostoyevsky
would
have
shown
us
the
source
in
the
obscure
depths
of
the
conscience
or
even
in
the
organism
of
his
hero
nekhludov
however
is
by
no
means
one
of
dostoyevsky
heroes
he
is
the
type
of
the
average
man
commonplace
sane
who
is
tolstoy
usual
hero
to
be
exact
we
are
conscious
of
the
juxtaposition
of
a
very
materialistic
character
and
a
moral
crisis
which
belongs
to
another
man
and
that
man
the
aged
tolstoy
the
same
impression
one
of
elemental
duality
is
again
produced
at
the
end
of
the
book
where
a
third
part
full
of
strictly
realistic
observation
is
set
beside
an
evangelical
conclusion
which
is
not
in
any
way
essential
it
is
an
act
of
personal
faith
which
does
not
logically
issue
from
the
life
under
observation
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
tolstoy
religion
has
become
involved
with
his
realism
but
in
previous
works
the
two
elements
have
been
better
mingled
here
they
are
not
amalgamated
they
simply
and
the
contrast
is
the
more
striking
in
that
tolstoy
faith
is
always
becoming
less
and
less
indifferent
to
proof
while
his
realism
is
daily
becoming
more
finely
whetted
more
free
from
convention
here
is
a
sign
not
of
fatigue
but
of
age
a
certain
stiffness
so
to
speak
in
the
joints
the
religious
conclusion
is
not
the
organic
development
of
the
work
it
is
a
ex
i
personally
am
convinced
that
right
in
the
depth
of
tolstoy
being
in
spite
of
all
his
affirmations
the
fusion
between
his
two
diverse
natures
was
by
no
means
complete
between
the
truth
of
the
artist
and
the
truth
of
the
believer
although
has
not
the
harmonious
fullness
of
the
work
of
his
youth
and
although
i
for
my
part
prefer
and
it
is
none
the
less
one
of
the
most
beautiful
poems
of
human
compassion
perhaps
the
most
truthful
ever
written
more
than
in
any
other
book
i
see
through
the
pages
of
this
those
bright
eyes
of
tolstoy
the
piercing
eyes
the
look
that
goes
straight
to
the
heart
and
in
each
heart
sees
its
god
and
is
more
or
less
of
a
transition
between
the
gloomy
novels
which
preceded
it
and
which
is
full
of
the
light
of
the
divine
charity
but
it
is
akin
to
death
of
ivan
and
the
rather
than
to
which
only
presents
towards
the
end
of
the
book
the
sublime
transformation
of
a
selfish
and
morally
cowardly
man
under
the
stress
of
an
impulse
of
sacrifice
the
greater
part
of
the
book
consists
of
the
extremely
realistic
picture
of
a
master
without
kindness
and
a
servant
full
of
resignation
who
are
surprised
by
night
on
the
steppes
by
a
blizzard
in
which
they
lose
their
way
the
master
who
at
first
tries
to
escape
deserting
his
companion
returns
and
finding
the
latter
throws
himself
upon
him
covering
him
with
his
body
gives
him
of
his
warmth
and
sacrifices
himself
by
instinct
he
does
not
know
why
but
the
tears
fill
his
eyes
it
seems
to
him
that
he
has
become
the
man
he
is
seeking
to
save
nikita
and
that
his
life
is
no
longer
in
himself
but
in
nikita
nikita
is
alive
then
i
am
still
alive
myself
he
has
almost
forgotten
who
he
vassili
was
he
thinks
vassili
did
not
know
what
had
to
be
done
but
i
i
know
he
hears
the
voice
of
him
whom
he
was
awaiting
here
his
dream
recalls
one
of
the
tales
of
him
who
a
little
while
ago
had
commanded
him
to
lie
upon
nikita
he
cries
quite
happy
lord
i
am
coming
and
he
feels
that
he
is
free
that
nothing
is
keeping
him
back
any
longer
he
is
dead
while
on
the
other
hand
he
had
mixed
in
all
the
various
circles
depicted
in
and
peace
anna
karenin
the
cossacks
and
the
of
the
nobles
the
army
the
life
of
the
country
estate
he
had
only
to
remember
men
carry
in
them
the
germ
of
all
the
human
qualities
and
they
manifest
now
one
now
another
so
that
they
often
appear
to
be
not
themselves
that
is
themselves
as
they
habitually
appear
among
some
these
changes
are
more
rare
among
others
more
rapid
to
the
second
class
of
men
belongs
nekhludov
under
the
influence
of
various
physical
or
moral
causes
sudden
and
complete
changes
are
incessantly
being
produced
within
him
many
times
in
his
life
he
had
proceeded
to
up
his
this
was
the
term
he
used
to
denote
those
moral
crises
in
which
he
decided
to
sweep
out
the
moral
refuse
which
littered
his
soul
at
the
conclusion
of
these
crises
he
never
failed
to
set
himself
certain
rules
which
he
swore
always
to
keep
he
kept
a
diary
he
began
a
new
life
but
each
time
it
was
not
long
before
he
fell
once
more
to
the
same
level
or
lower
still
than
before
the
crisis
upon
learning
that
maslova
is
engaged
in
an
intrigue
with
a
hospital
attendant
nekhludov
is
more
than
ever
decided
to
sacrifice
his
liberty
in
order
to
redeem
the
sin
of
this
woman
tolstoy
has
never
drawn
a
character
with
so
sure
so
broad
a
touch
as
in
the
beginning
of
witness
the
admirable
description
of
nekhludov
toilet
and
his
actions
of
the
morning
before
the
first
session
in
the
palace
of
justice
the
word
act
to
be
found
here
and
there
in
the
text
in
such
phrases
as
act
of
faith
act
of
will
is
used
in
a
sense
peculiar
to
catholic
and
orthodox
christians
a
penitent
is
told
to
perform
an
act
of
faith
as
penance
which
is
usually
the
repetition
of
certain
prayers
of
the
nature
of
a
creed
the
act
in
short
is
a
repetition
a
declamation
a
meditation

religion
and
politics
tolstoy
never
renounced
his
art
a
great
artist
can
not
even
if
he
would
abandon
the
reason
of
his
existence
he
can
for
religious
reasons
cease
to
publish
but
he
can
not
cease
to
write
tolstoy
never
interrupted
his
work
of
artistic
creation
paul
boyer
who
saw
him
during
the
last
few
years
at
yasnaya
polyana
says
that
he
would
now
give
prominence
to
his
evangelistic
works
now
to
his
works
of
imagination
he
would
work
at
the
one
as
a
relaxation
from
the
other
when
he
had
finished
some
social
pamphlet
some
to
the
or
the
ruled
he
would
allow
himself
to
resume
one
of
the
charming
tales
which
he
was
so
to
speak
in
process
of
recounting
to
himself
such
as
his
a
military
epic
which
celebrated
an
episode
of
the
wars
of
the
caucasus
and
the
resistance
of
the
mountaineers
under
schamyl
art
was
still
his
relaxation
his
pleasure
but
he
would
have
thought
it
a
piece
of
vanity
to
make
a
parade
of
it
with
the
exception
of
his
of
readings
for
every
day
of
the
in
which
he
collected
the
thoughts
of
various
writers
upon
and
the
a
true
anthology
of
the
poetical
wisdom
of
the
world
from
the
holy
books
of
the
east
to
the
works
of
contemporary
writers
nearly
all
his
literary
works
of
art
properly
so
called
which
have
been
written
later
than
have
remained
in
manuscript
on
the
other
hand
he
was
boldly
and
ardently
casting
his
mystical
and
polemical
writings
upon
the
social
battlefield
from
to
such
work
absorbed
the
greater
part
of
his
time
and
energy
russia
was
passing
through
an
alarming
crisis
for
a
moment
the
empire
of
the
tsars
seemed
to
totter
on
its
foundations
and
about
to
fall
in
ruin
the
war
the
disasters
which
followed
it
the
revolutionary
troubles
the
mutinies
in
the
army
and
the
fleet
the
massacres
the
agrarian
disorders
seemed
to
mark
the
end
of
a
world
to
quote
the
title
of
one
of
tolstoy
writings
the
height
of
the
crisis
was
reached
in
and
during
these
years
tolstoy
published
a
remarkable
series
of
works
and
revolution
the
great
crime
the
end
of
a
during
the
last
ten
years
of
his
life
he
occupied
a
situation
unique
not
only
in
russia
but
in
the
world
he
was
alone
a
stranger
to
all
the
parties
to
all
countries
and
rejected
by
his
church
which
had
excommunicated
him
the
logic
of
his
reason
and
the
revolutionary
character
of
his
faith
had
led
him
to
this
dilemma
to
live
a
stranger
to
other
men
or
a
stranger
to
the
truth
he
recalls
the
russian
proverb
an
old
man
who
lies
is
a
rich
man
who
steals
and
he
severs
himself
from
mankind
in
order
to
speak
the
truth
he
tells
the
whole
truth
and
to
all
the
old
hunter
of
lies
continues
unweariedly
to
mark
down
all
superstitions
religious
or
social
and
all
fetishes
the
only
exceptions
are
the
old
maleficent
powers
the
persecutrix
the
church
and
the
imperial
autocracy
perhaps
his
enmity
towards
them
was
in
some
degree
appeased
now
that
all
were
casting
stones
at
them
they
were
familiar
therefore
they
were
already
not
so
formidable
after
all
too
the
church
and
the
tsar
were
carrying
on
their
peculiar
trades
they
were
at
least
not
deceptive
tolstoy
in
his
letter
to
the
tsar
nikolas
although
he
speaks
the
truth
in
a
manner
entirely
unaccommodating
to
the
man
as
sovereign
is
full
of
gentleness
for
the
sovereign
as
man
addressing
him
as
dear
brother
praying
him
to
pardon
him
if
he
has
hurt
him
unintentionally
and
signing
himself
your
brother
who
wishes
you
true
happiness
what
tolstoy
can
least
find
it
in
him
to
pardon
what
he
denounces
with
the
utmost
hatred
are
the
new
lies
not
the
old
ones
which
are
no
longer
able
to
deceive
not
despotism
but
the
illusion
of
liberty
it
is
difficult
to
say
which
he
hates
the
more
among
the
followers
of
the
newer
idols
whether
the
socialists
or
the
liberals
he
had
a
antipathy
for
the
liberals
it
had
seized
upon
him
suddenly
when
as
an
officer
fresh
from
sebastopol
he
found
himself
in
the
society
of
the
literary
men
of
petersburg
it
had
been
one
of
the
causes
of
his
misunderstanding
with
tourgenev
the
arrogant
noble
the
man
of
ancient
race
could
not
support
these
intellectuals
with
their
profession
of
making
the
nation
happy
whether
by
its
will
or
against
it
by
forcing
their
utopian
schemes
upon
it
very
much
a
russian
and
of
the
old
stamp
he
instinctively
distrusted
all
liberal
innovations
and
the
constitutional
ideas
which
came
from
the
west
and
his
two
journeys
abroad
only
intensified
his
prejudices
on
his
return
from
his
first
journey
he
wrote
to
avoid
the
ambition
of
liberalism
on
his
return
from
the
second
a
privileged
society
has
no
right
whatsoever
to
educate
in
its
own
way
the
masses
of
which
it
knows
nothing
in
he
freely
expresses
his
contempt
for
liberals
in
general
levine
refuses
to
associate
himself
with
the
work
of
the
provincial
institutions
for
educating
the
people
and
the
innovations
which
are
the
order
of
the
day
the
picture
of
the
elections
to
the
provincial
assembly
exposes
the
fool
bargain
by
which
the
country
changes
its
ancient
conservative
administration
for
a
liberal
nothing
is
really
altered
except
that
there
is
one
lie
the
more
while
the
masters
are
of
inferior
blood
we
are
not
worth
very
much
perhaps
says
the
representative
of
the
aristocracy
but
none
the
less
we
have
lasted
a
thousand
years
tolstoy
fulminates
against
the
manner
in
which
the
liberals
abuse
the
words
the
people
the
will
of
the
people
what
do
they
know
of
the
people
who
are
the
people
but
it
is
more
especially
when
the
liberal
movement
seemed
on
the
point
of
succeeding
and
achieving
the
convocation
of
the
first
duma
that
tolstoy
expressed
most
violently
his
disapprobation
of
its
constitutional
ideas
during
the
last
few
years
the
deformation
of
christianity
has
given
rise
to
a
new
species
of
fraud
which
has
rooted
our
peoples
yet
more
firmly
in
their
servility
with
the
help
of
a
complicated
system
of
parliamentary
elections
it
was
suggested
to
them
that
by
electing
their
representatives
directly
they
were
participating
in
the
government
and
that
in
obeying
them
they
were
obeying
their
own
will
in
short
that
they
were
free
this
is
a
piece
of
imposture
the
people
can
not
express
its
will
even
with
the
aid
of
universal
suffrage
because
no
such
collective
will
of
a
nation
of
many
millions
of
inhabitants
could
exist
because
even
if
it
existed
the
majority
of
voices
would
not
be
its
expression
without
insisting
on
the
fact
that
those
elected
would
legislate
and
administrate
not
for
the
general
good
but
in
order
to
maintain
themselves
in
power
without
counting
on
the
fact
of
the
popular
corruption
due
to
pressure
and
electoral
corruption
this
fraud
is
particularly
harmful
because
of
the
presumptuous
slavery
into
which
all
those
who
submit
to
it
fall
these
free
men
recall
the
prisoners
who
imagine
that
they
are
enjoying
freedom
when
they
have
the
right
to
elect
those
of
their
gaolers
who
are
entrusted
with
the
interior
policing
of
the
prison
a
member
of
a
despotic
state
may
be
entirely
free
even
in
the
midst
of
the
most
brutal
violence
but
a
member
of
a
constitutional
state
is
always
a
slave
for
he
recognises
the
legality
of
the
violence
done
him
and
now
men
wish
to
lead
the
russian
people
into
the
same
state
of
constitutional
slavery
in
which
the
other
european
peoples
dwell
in
his
hostility
towards
liberalism
contempt
was
his
dominant
feeling
in
respect
of
socialism
his
dominant
feeling
was
or
rather
would
have
been
hatred
if
tolstoy
had
not
forbidden
himself
to
hate
anything
whatever
he
detested
it
doubly
because
socialism
was
the
amalgamation
of
two
lies
the
lie
of
liberty
and
the
lie
of
science
does
it
not
profess
to
be
founded
upon
some
sort
of
economic
science
whose
laws
absolutely
rule
the
progress
of
the
world
tolstoy
is
very
hard
upon
science
he
has
pages
full
of
terrible
irony
concerning
this
modern
superstition
and
these
futile
problems
the
origin
of
species
spectrum
analysis
the
nature
of
radium
the
theory
of
numbers
animal
fossils
and
other
nonsense
to
which
people
attach
as
much
importance
as
they
attributed
in
the
middle
ages
to
the
immaculate
conception
or
the
duality
of
substance
he
derides
these
servants
of
science
who
just
as
the
servants
of
the
church
persuade
themselves
and
others
that
they
are
saving
humanity
who
like
the
church
believe
in
their
own
infallibility
never
agree
among
themselves
divide
themselves
into
sects
and
like
the
church
are
the
chief
cause
of
unmannerliness
moral
ignorance
and
the
long
delay
of
humanity
in
freeing
itself
from
the
evils
under
which
it
suffers
for
they
have
rejected
the
only
thing
that
could
unite
humanity
the
religious
conscience
but
his
anxiety
redoubles
and
his
indignation
bursts
its
bounds
when
he
sees
the
dangerous
weapon
of
the
new
fanaticism
in
the
hands
of
those
who
profess
to
be
regenerating
humanity
every
revolutionist
saddens
him
when
he
resorts
to
violence
but
the
intellectual
and
theoretical
revolutionary
inspires
him
with
horror
he
is
a
pedantic
murderer
an
arrogant
sterile
intelligence
who
loves
not
men
but
ideas
moreover
these
ideas
are
of
a
low
order
the
object
of
socialism
is
the
satisfaction
of
the
lowest
needs
of
man
his
material
and
it
can
not
attain
even
this
end
by
the
means
it
recommends
at
heart
he
is
without
love
he
feels
only
hatred
for
the
oppressors
and
a
black
envy
for
the
assured
and
easy
life
of
the
rich
a
greed
like
that
of
the
flies
that
gather
about
ordure
when
socialism
is
victorious
the
aspect
of
the
world
will
be
terrible
the
european
horde
will
rush
upon
the
weak
and
barbarous
peoples
with
redoubled
force
and
will
enslave
them
in
order
that
the
ancient
proletariats
of
europe
may
debauch
themselves
at
their
leisure
by
idle
luxury
as
did
the
people
of
rome
happily
the
principal
energies
of
socialism
spend
themselves
in
smoke
in
speeches
like
those
of
jaurès
what
an
admirable
orator
there
is
something
of
everything
in
his
speeches
and
there
is
nothing
socialism
is
a
little
like
our
russian
orthodoxy
you
press
it
you
push
it
into
its
last
trenches
you
think
you
have
got
it
fast
and
suddenly
it
turns
round
and
tells
you
i
not
the
one
you
think
i
somebody
else
and
it
slips
out
of
your
hands
patience
let
time
do
its
work
there
will
be
socialistic
theories
as
there
are
women
fashions
which
soon
pass
from
the
to
the
servants
hall
although
tolstoy
waged
war
in
this
manner
upon
the
liberals
and
socialists
it
was
not
far
from
it
to
leave
the
field
free
for
autocracy
on
the
contrary
it
was
that
the
battle
might
be
fought
in
all
its
fierceness
between
the
old
world
and
the
new
after
the
army
of
disorderly
and
dangerous
elements
had
been
eliminated
for
tolstoy
too
was
a
believer
in
the
revolution
but
his
revolution
was
of
a
very
different
colour
to
that
of
the
revolutionaries
it
was
rather
that
of
a
believer
of
the
middle
ages
who
looked
on
the
morrow
perhaps
that
very
day
for
the
reign
of
the
holy
spirit
i
believe
that
at
this
very
hour
the
great
revolution
is
beginning
which
has
been
preparing
for
two
thousand
years
in
the
christian
world
the
revolution
which
will
substitute
for
corrupted
christianity
and
the
system
of
domination
which
proceeds
therefrom
the
true
christianity
the
basis
of
equality
between
men
and
of
the
true
liberty
to
which
all
beings
endowed
with
reason
aspire
what
time
does
he
choose
this
seer
and
prophet
for
his
announcement
of
the
new
era
of
love
and
happiness
the
darkest
hour
of
russian
history
the
hour
of
disaster
and
of
shame
superb
power
of
creative
faith
all
around
it
is
light
even
in
darkness
tolstoy
saw
in
death
the
signs
of
renewal
in
the
calamities
of
the
war
in
manchuria
in
the
downfall
of
the
russian
armies
in
the
frightful
anarchy
and
the
bloody
struggle
of
the
classes
his
logic
the
logic
of
a
dream
drew
from
the
victory
of
japan
the
astonishing
conclusion
that
russia
should
withdraw
from
all
warfare
because
the
peoples
will
always
have
the
advantage
in
warfare
over
the
christian
peoples
who
have
passed
through
the
phase
of
servile
submission
does
this
mean
the
abdication
of
the
russian
people
no
this
is
pride
at
its
supremest
russia
should
withdraw
from
all
warfare
because
she
must
accomplish
the
great
revolution
the
revolution
of
which
will
set
men
free
from
brutal
oppression
must
commence
in
russia
it
is
beginning
why
must
russia
play
the
part
of
the
chosen
people
because
the
new
revolution
must
before
all
repair
the
great
crime
the
great
monopolisation
of
the
soil
for
the
profit
of
a
few
thousands
of
wealthy
men
and
the
slavery
of
millions
of
men
the
cruellest
of
enslavements
and
because
no
people
was
so
conscious
of
this
iniquity
as
the
russian
people
again
and
more
especially
because
the
russian
people
is
of
all
peoples
most
thoroughly
steeped
in
the
true
christianity
so
that
the
coming
revolution
should
realise
in
the
name
of
christ
the
law
of
union
and
of
love
now
this
law
of
love
can
not
be
fulfilled
unless
it
is
based
upon
the
law
of
to
evil
this
let
us
mark
this
well
we
who
have
the
misfortune
to
see
in
it
simply
an
utopian
fad
peculiar
to
tolstoy
and
to
a
few
dreamers
has
always
been
an
essential
trait
of
the
russian
people
the
russian
people
has
always
assumed
with
regard
to
power
an
attitude
entirely
strange
to
the
other
peoples
of
europe
it
has
never
entered
upon
a
conflict
with
power
it
has
never
participated
in
it
and
consequently
has
never
been
depraved
by
it
it
has
regarded
power
as
an
evil
which
must
be
avoided
an
ancient
legend
represents
the
russians
as
appealing
to
the
varingians
to
come
and
govern
them
the
majority
of
the
russians
have
always
preferred
to
submit
to
acts
of
violence
rather
than
respond
with
violence
or
participate
therein
they
have
therefore
always
submitted
a
voluntary
submission
having
nothing
in
common
with
servile
obedience
the
true
christian
may
submit
indeed
it
is
impossible
for
him
not
to
submit
without
a
struggle
to
no
matter
what
violence
but
he
could
not
obey
it
that
is
he
could
not
recognise
it
as
legitimate
at
the
time
of
writing
these
lines
tolstoy
was
still
subject
to
the
emotion
caused
by
one
of
the
most
tragical
examples
of
this
heroic
nonresistance
of
a
people
the
bloody
manifestation
of
january
in
petersburg
when
an
unarmed
crowd
led
by
father
gapon
allowed
itself
to
be
shot
down
without
a
cry
of
hatred
or
a
gesture
of
for
a
long
time
the
old
believers
known
in
russia
as
the
had
been
obstinately
practising
in
spite
of
persecution
to
the
state
and
had
refused
to
recognise
the
legitimacy
of
its
power
the
absurdity
of
the
war
enabled
this
state
of
mind
to
spread
without
difficulty
through
the
rural
districts
refusals
of
military
service
became
more
and
more
general
and
the
more
brutally
they
were
punished
the
more
stubborn
the
revolt
grew
in
secret
in
the
provinces
moreover
whole
races
who
knew
nothing
of
tolstoy
had
given
the
example
of
an
absolute
and
passive
refusal
to
obey
the
state
the
doukhobors
of
the
caucasus
as
early
as
and
the
georgians
of
the
gouri
towards
tolstoy
influenced
these
movements
far
less
than
they
influenced
him
and
the
interest
of
his
writings
lies
in
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
the
criticisms
of
those
writers
who
were
of
the
party
of
revolution
as
was
gorky
he
was
the
mouthpiece
of
the
old
russian
people
the
attitude
which
he
preserved
in
respect
of
men
who
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
were
putting
into
practice
the
principles
which
he
professed
was
one
of
extreme
modesty
and
dignity
neither
to
the
doukhobors
and
the
gourians
nor
to
the
refractory
soldiers
did
he
assume
the
pose
of
a
master
or
teacher
he
who
suffers
no
trials
can
teach
nothing
to
him
who
does
so
suffer
he
implores
the
forgiveness
of
all
those
whom
his
words
and
his
writings
may
have
caused
to
suffer
he
never
urges
any
one
to
refuse
military
service
it
is
a
matter
for
every
man
to
decide
for
himself
if
he
discusses
the
matter
with
any
one
who
is
hesitating
he
always
advises
him
not
to
refuse
obedience
so
long
as
it
would
not
be
morally
impossible
for
if
a
man
hesitates
it
is
because
he
is
not
ripe
and
it
is
better
to
have
one
soldier
the
more
than
a
renegade
or
hypocrite
which
is
what
becomes
of
those
who
undertake
a
task
beyond
their
strength
he
distrusts
the
resolution
of
the
refractory
gontcharenko
he
fears
that
this
young
man
may
have
been
carried
away
by
vanity
and
vainglory
not
by
the
love
of
god
to
the
doukhobors
he
writes
that
they
should
not
persist
in
their
refusal
of
obedience
out
of
pride
but
if
they
are
capable
of
so
doing
they
should
save
their
weaker
women
and
their
children
no
one
will
blame
them
for
that
they
must
persist
only
if
the
spirit
of
christ
is
indeed
within
them
because
then
they
will
be
happy
to
suffer
in
any
case
he
prays
those
who
are
persecuted
at
any
cost
not
to
break
their
affectionate
relations
with
those
who
persecute
them
one
must
love
even
herod
as
he
says
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
you
say
can
not
love
herod
i
do
not
know
but
i
feel
and
you
also
that
one
must
love
him
i
know
and
you
also
that
if
i
do
not
love
him
i
suffer
that
there
is
no
life
in
me
the
divine
purity
the
unvarying
ardour
of
this
love
which
in
the
end
can
no
longer
be
contented
even
by
the
words
of
the
gospel
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
because
he
finds
in
them
a
taint
of
egoism
too
vast
a
love
in
the
opinion
of
some
and
so
free
from
human
egoism
that
it
wastes
itself
in
the
void
yet
who
more
than
tolstoy
distrusts
abstract
love
the
greatest
modern
sin
the
abstract
love
of
humanity
impersonal
love
for
those
who
are
somewhere
out
of
sight
to
love
those
we
do
not
know
those
whom
we
shall
never
meet
is
so
easy
a
thing
there
is
no
need
to
sacrifice
anything
and
at
the
same
time
we
are
so
pleased
with
ourselves
the
conscience
is
no
we
must
love
our
neighbours
those
we
live
with
and
who
are
in
our
way
and
embarrass
us
i
have
read
in
most
of
the
studies
of
tolstoy
work
that
his
faith
and
philosophy
are
not
original
it
is
true
the
beauty
of
these
ideas
is
eternal
and
can
never
appear
a
momentary
fashion
others
complain
of
their
utopian
character
this
also
is
true
they
are
utopian
the
new
testament
is
utopian
a
prophet
is
a
utopian
he
treads
the
earth
but
sees
the
life
of
eternity
and
that
this
apparition
should
have
been
granted
to
us
that
we
should
have
seen
among
us
the
last
of
the
prophets
that
the
greatest
of
our
artists
should
wear
this
aureole
on
his
brow
there
it
seems
to
me
is
a
fact
more
novel
and
of
far
greater
importance
to
the
world
than
one
religion
the
more
or
a
new
philosophy
those
are
blind
who
do
not
perceive
the
miracle
of
this
great
mind
the
incarnation
of
fraternal
love
in
the
midst
of
a
people
and
a
century
stained
with
the
blood
of
hatred
november
tolstoy
regarded
this
as
one
of
his
most
important
works

my
books

which

to
attach

the

other
objections
to

they
have
always
played
the
part
of
dupes
they
act
as
the
accomplices
of
the
autocracy
through
fear
their
participation
in
the

gives
the
latter
a
moral
prestige
and
accustoms
them
to

which
quickly
make
them

instruments
of

alexander
ii
used
to
say
that
all
the
liberals
were
ready
to
sell
themselves
for
honours
if
not
for
money
alexander
iii
was
able
without
danger
to
eradicate
the
liberal
work
of
his
father
the
liberals
whispered
among
themselves
that
this
did
not
please
them
but
they
continued
to
attend
the
tribunals
to
serve
the
state
and
the
press
in
the
press
they
alluded
to
those
things
to
which
allusion
was
allowed
and
were
silent
upon
matters
to
which
allusion
was
prohibited
they
did
the
same
under
nikolas
ii
when
this
young
man
who
knows
nothing
and
understands
nothing
replies
tactlessly
and
with
effrontery
to
the
representatives
of
the
people
do
the
liberals
protest
by
no
means
from
every
side
they
send
the
young
tsar
their
cowardly
and
flattering
congratulations
and
in
at
the
hearing
of
maslova
appeal
in
the
senate
it
is
a
materialistic
darwinist
who
is
most
strongly
opposed
to
the
revision
because
he
is
secretly
shocked
that
nekhludov
should
wish
as
a
matter
of
duty
to
marry
a
prostitute
any
manifestation
of
duty
and
still
more
of
religious
feeling
having
the
effect
upon
him
of
a
personal
insult

a
type

novodvorov
the

whose
excessive
vanity
and
egoism
have
sterilised

æsthetic
qualities
which
produce

following

great
russia
was
actually
in

special
situation
and
although
tolstoy
may
have
been
wrong
to
found
his
generalisations
concerning
other
european
states
upon
the
condition
of
russia
we
can
not
be
surprised
that
he
was
most
sensible
to
the
sufferings
which
touched
him
most
nearly

through

impudently
mock

those
who
are
apparently
looking
everywhere
for
the
means
of
bettering
the
condition
of
the
masses
of

remind
one
of
what
one
sees
in
the
theatre
when
all
the
spectators
have
an
excellent
view
of
an
actor
who
is
supposed
to
be
concealed
while
his
who
also
have
a
full
view
of
him
pretend
not
to
see
him
and
endeavour
to
distract
one
another
attention
from
him
there
is
no
remedy
but
that
of
returning
the
soil
to
the
labouring
people
as
a
solution
of
the
property
question
tolstoy
recommends
the
doctrine
of
henry
george
and
his
suggested
single
tax
upon
the
value
of
the
soil
this
is
his
economic
gospel
he
returns
to
it
unwearied
and
has
assimilated
it
so
thoroughly
that
in
his
writings
he
often
uses
entire
phrases
of
george
the
law
of
to
evil
is
the
keystone
of
the
whole
building
to
admit
the
law
of
mutual
help
while
misunderstanding
the
precept
of
is
to
build
the
vault
without
sealing
the
central
portion
end
of
a
in
a
letter
written
in
to
a

tolstoy
complains
of
the
false
interpretation
given
to
his
doctrine
of
people
he
says
confound
not
oppose
evil
by
with
not
oppose
that
is
to
say
indifferent
to
whereas
the
conflict
with
evil
is
the
sole
object
of
christianity
and
the
commandment
of
to
evil
is
given
as
the
most
effectual
means
of

end

two

a

he
has
isolated
himself
from

and
he
no
longer
listens
to
the
voice
of
the
people
he
hovers
over
russia
at

great
a
height
it
was
a
bitter
trial
to
him
that
he
could
not
contrive
to
be
persecuted
he
had
a
thirst
for
martyrdom
but
the

very
wisely
took
good
care
not
to
satisfy
him

are

all
around

old
age

face

taken
on

lines

become
as
it
will
remain
in
the
memory
of
men
the
large
countenance
crossed
by
the
arch
of
a
double
furrow
the
white
bristling
eyebrows
the
patriarchal
beard
recalling
that
of
the
moses

the
aged
face
was
gentler
and
softer
it
bore
the
traces
of
illness
of
sorrow
of
disappointment
and
of
affectionate
kindness
what
a
change
from
the
almost
animal
brutality
of
the
same
face
at
twenty
and
the
heavy
rigidity
of
the
soldier
of
sebastopol
but
the
eyes
have
always
the
same
profound
fixity
the
same
look
of
loyalty
which
hides
nothing
and
from
which
nothing
is
hidden
nine
years
before
his
death
in
his
reply
to
the
holy
synod
april
tolstoy
had
said
i
owe
it
to
my
faith
to
live
in
peace
and
gladness
and
to
be
able
also
in
peace
and
gladness
to
travel
on
towards
death
reading
this
i
am
reminded
of
the
ancient
saying
that
we
should
call
no
man
happy
until
he
is
dead
were
they
lasting
this
peace
and
joy
that
he
then
boasted
of
possessing
the
hopes
of
the
great
revolution
of
had
vanished
the
shadows
had
gathered
more
thickly
the
expected
light
had
never
risen
to
the
upheavals
of
the
revolutionaries
exhaustion
had
succeeded
nothing
of
the
old
injustice
was
altered
except
that
poverty
had
increased
even
in
tolstoy
had
lost
a
little
of
his
confidence
in
the
historic
vocation
of
the
russian
slavs
and
his
obstinate
faith
sought
abroad
for
other
peoples
whom
he
might
invest
with
this
mission
he
thought
of
the
great
and
wise
chinese
nation
he
believed
that
the
peoples
of
the
orient
were
called
to
recover
that
liberty
which
the
peoples
of
the
occident
had
lost
almost
without
chance
of
recovery
and
that
china
at
the
head
of
the
asiatic
peoples
would
accomplish
the
transformation
of
humanity
in
the
way
of
tao
the
eternal
law
a
hope
quickly
destroyed
the
china
of
and
confucius
was
decrying
its
bygone
wisdom
as
japan
had
already
done
in
order
to
imitate
europe
the
persecuted
doukhobors
had
migrated
to
canada
and
there
to
the
scandal
of
tolstoy
they
immediately
reverted
to
the
property
system
the
gourians
were
scarcely
delivered
from
the
yoke
of
the
state
when
they
began
to
destroy
those
who
did
not
think
as
they
did
and
the
russian
troops
were
called
out
to
put
matters
in
order
the
very
jews
whose
native
country
had
hitherto
been
the
fairest
a
man
could
desire
the
book
were
attacked
by
the
malady
of
zionism
that
movement
of
false
nationalism
which
is
flesh
of
the
flesh
of
contemporary
europeanism
or
rather
its
rickety
child
tolstoy
was
saddened
but
not
discouraged
he
had
faith
in
god
and
in
the
future
all
would
be
perfect
if
one
could
grow
a
forest
in
the
wink
of
an
eye
unhappily
this
is
impossible
we
must
wait
until
the
seed
germinates
until
the
shoots
push
up
the
leaves
come
and
then
the
stem
which
finally
becomes
a
tree
but
many
trees
are
needed
to
make
a
forest
and
tolstoy
was
alone
glorious
but
alone
men
wrote
to
him
from
all
parts
of
the
world
from
mohamedan
countries
from
china
and
japan
where
was
translated
and
where
his
ideas
upon
the
restitution
of
the
land
to
the
people
were
being
propagated
the
american
papers
interviewed
viewed
him
the
french
consulted
him
on
matters
of
art
or
the
separation
of
church
and
state
but
he
had
not
three
hundred
disciples
and
he
knew
it
moreover
he
did
not
take
pains
to
make
them
he
repulsed
the
attempts
of
his
friends
to
form
groups
of
tolstoyans
we
must
not
go
in
search
of
one
another
but
we
must
all
seek
god
you
say
it
is
what
to
labour
to
reap
yes
but
to
draw
near
to
god
one
can
only
do
so
in
isolation
i
see
the
world
as
an
enormous
temple
in
which
the
light
falls
from
on
high
and
precisely
in
the
middle
to
become
united
we
must
all
go
towards
the
light
then
all
of
us
come
together
from
all
directions
will
find
ourselves
in
the
company
of
men
we
did
not
look
for
in
that
is
the
joy
how
many
have
found
themselves
together
under
the
ray
which
falls
from
the
dome
what
matter
it
is
enough
to
be
one
and
alone
if
one
is
with
god
as
only
a
burning
object
can
communicate
fire
to
other
objects
so
only
the
true
faith
and
life
of
a
man
can
communicate
themselves
to
other
men
and
to
spread
the
truth
perhaps
but
to
what
point
was
this
isolated
faith
able
to
assure
tolstoy
of
happiness
how
far
he
was
in
his
latter
days
from
the
voluntary
calm
of
a
goethe
one
would
almost
say
that
he
avoided
it
fled
from
it
hated
it
one
must
thank
god
for
being
discontented
with
oneself
if
one
could
always
be
so
the
discord
of
life
with
what
ought
to
be
is
precisely
the
sign
of
life
itself
the
movement
upwards
from
the
lesser
to
the
greater
from
worse
to
better
and
this
discord
is
the
condition
of
good
it
is
an
evil
when
a
man
is
calm
and
satisfied
with
himself
he
imagines
the
following
subject
for
a
novel
showing
that
the
persistent
discontent
of
a
levine
or
a
besoukhov
was
not
yet
extinct
in
him
i
often
picture
to
myself
a
man
brought
up
in
revolutionary
circles
and
at
first
a
revolutionist
then
a
populist
then
a
socialist
then
orthodox
then
a
monk
at
afone
then
an
atheist
a
good
paterfamilias
and
finally
a
doukhobor
he
takes
up
everything
and
is
always
forsaking
everything
men
deride
him
for
he
has
performed
nothing
and
dies
forgotten
in
a
hospital
dying
he
thinks
he
has
wasted
his
life
and
yet
he
is
a
saint
had
he
still
doubts
he
so
full
of
faith
who
knows
in
a
man
who
has
remained
robust
in
body
and
mind
even
into
old
age
life
can
not
come
to
a
halt
at
a
definite
stage
of
thought
life
goes
onwards
movement
is
life
many
things
must
have
changed
within
him
during
the
last
few
years
did
he
not
modify
his
opinion
of
revolutionaries
who
can
even
say
that
his
faith
in
to
evil
was
not
at
length
a
little
shaken
even
in
the
relations
of
nekhludov
with
the
condemned
politicals
completely
change
his
ideas
as
to
the
russian
revolutionary
party
up
till
that
time
he
had
felt
an
aversion
for
their
cruelty
their
criminal
dissimulation
their
attempts
upon
life
their
sufficiency
their
selfcontentment
their
insupportable
vanity
but
when
he
saw
them
more
closely
when
he
saw
how
they
were
treated
by
the
authorities
he
understood
that
they
could
not
be
otherwise
and
he
admires
their
high
ideal
of
duty
which
implies
total
since
however
the
revolutionary
tide
had
risen
starting
from
the
intellectuals
it
had
gained
the
people
and
was
obscurely
moving
amidst
the
thousands
of
the
poor
the
of
their
threatening
army
defiled
below
tolstoy
window
at
yasnaya
polyana
three
tales
published
by
the
de
france
which
were
among
the
last
pages
written
by
tolstoy
give
us
a
glimpse
of
the
sorrow
and
the
perplexity
which
this
spectacle
caused
him
the
years
were
indeed
remote
when
the
pilgrims
wandered
through
the
countryside
of
toula
pious
and
simple
of
heart
now
he
saw
the
invasion
of
starving
wanderers
they
came
to
him
every
day
tolstoy
who
chatted
with
them
was
struck
by
the
hatred
that
animated
them
they
no
longer
as
before
saw
the
rich
as
people
who
save
their
souls
by
distributing
alms
but
as
bandits
brigands
who
drink
the
blood
of
the
labouring
people
many
were
educated
men
ruined
on
the
brink
of
that
despair
which
makes
a
man
capable
of
anything
it
is
not
in
the
deserts
and
the
forests
but
in
slums
of
cities
and
on
the
great
highways
that
the
barbarians
are
reared
who
will
do
to
modern
civilisation
what
the
huns
and
vandals
did
to
the
ancient
civilisation
so
said
henry
george
and
tolstoy
adds
the
vandals
are
already
here
in
russia
and
they
will
be
particularly
terrible
among
our
profoundly
religious
people
because
we
know
nothing
of
the
curbs
the
and
public
opinion
which
are
so
strongly
developed
among
european
peoples
tolstoy
often
received
letters
from
these
rebels
protesting
against
his
doctrine
of
to
evil
and
saying
that
the
evil
that
the
rulers
and
the
wealthy
do
to
the
people
can
only
be
replied
to
by
cries
of
vengeance
vengeance
vengeance
did
tolstoy
still
condemn
them
we
do
not
know
but
when
a
few
days
later
he
saw
in
his
own
village
the
villagers
weeping
while
their
sheep
and
their
samovars
were
seized
and
taken
from
them
by
callous
authorities
he
also
cried
vengeance
in
vain
against
these
thieves
these
ministers
and
their
acolytes
who
are
engaged
in
the
brandy
traffic
or
in
teaching
men
to
murder
or
condemning
men
to
deportation
prison
or
the
gallows
these
men
all
perfectly
convinced
that
the
samovars
sheep
calves
and
linen
which
they
took
from
the
miserable
peasants
would
find
their
highest
use
in
furthering
the
distillation
of
brandy
which
poisons
the
drinker
in
the
manufacture
of
murderous
weapons
in
the
construction
of
jails
and
convict
prisons
and
above
all
in
the
distribution
of
appointments
to
their
assistants
and
themselves
it
is
sad
after
a
whole
life
lived
in
the
expectation
and
the
proclamation
of
the
reign
of
love
to
be
forced
to
close
ones
in
the
midst
of
these
threatening
visions
and
to
feel
one
whole
position
crumbling
it
is
still
sadder
for
one
with
the
impeccably
truthful
conscience
of
a
tolstoy
to
be
forced
to
confess
to
oneself
that
one
life
has
not
been
lived
entirely
in
accordance
with
principles
here
we
touch
upon
the
most
pitiful
point
of
these
latter
years
should
we
say
of
the
last
thirty
years
and
we
can
only
touch
upon
it
with
a
pious
and
tentative
hand
for
this
sorrow
of
which
tolstoy
endeavoured
to
keep
the
secret
belongs
not
only
to
him
who
is
dead
but
to
others
who
are
living
whom
he
loved
and
who
loved
him
he
was
never
able
to
communicate
his
faith
to
those
who
were
dearest
to
him
his
wife
and
children
we
have
seen
how
the
loyal
comrade
who
had
so
valiantly
shared
his
artistic
life
and
labour
suffered
when
he
denied
his
faith
in
art
for
a
different
and
a
moral
faith
which
she
did
not
understand
tolstoy
suffered
no
less
at
feeling
that
he
was
misunderstood
by
his
nearest
friend
i
feel
in
all
my
being
he
wrote
to
teneromo
the
truth
of
these
words
that
the
husband
and
the
wife
are
not
separate
beings
but
are
as
one
i
wish
most
earnestly
that
i
had
the
power
to
transmit
to
my
wife
a
portion
of
that
religious
conscience
which
gives
me
the
possibility
of
sometimes
raising
myself
above
the
sorrows
of
life
i
hope
that
it
will
be
given
her
very
probably
not
by
me
but
by
god
although
this
conscience
is
hardly
accessible
to
women
it
seems
that
this
wish
was
never
gratified
countess
tolstoy
loved
and
admired
the
purity
of
heart
the
candid
heroism
and
the
goodness
of
the
great
man
who
was
as
one
with
her
she
saw
that
he
marched
ahead
of
the
host
and
showed
men
the
way
they
should
follow
when
the
holy
synod
excommunicated
him
she
bravely
undertook
his
defence
and
insisted
on
sharing
the
danger
which
threatened
him
but
she
could
not
force
herself
to
believe
what
she
did
not
believe
and
tolstoy
was
too
sincere
to
urge
her
to
pretend
he
who
loathed
the
petty
deceits
of
faith
and
love
even
more
than
the
negation
of
faith
and
love
how
then
could
he
constrain
her
not
believing
to
modify
her
life
to
sacrifice
her
fortune
and
that
of
her
children
with
his
children
the
rift
was
wider
still
who
saw
tolstoy
with
his
family
at
yasnaya
polyana
says
that
at
table
when
the
father
was
speaking
the
sons
barely
concealed
their
weariness
and
unbelief
his
faith
had
only
slightly
affected
two
or
three
of
his
daughters
of
whom
one
marie
was
dead
he
was
morally
isolated
in
the
heart
of
his
family
he
had
scarcely
any
one
but
his
youngest
daughter
and
his
doctor
to
understand
him
he
suffered
from
this
mental
loneliness
and
he
suffered
from
the
social
relations
which
were
forced
upon
him
the
reception
of
fatiguing
visitors
from
every
quarter
of
the
globe
americans
and
the
idly
curious
who
wore
him
out
he
suffered
from
the
luxury
in
which
his
family
life
forced
him
to
live
it
was
a
modest
luxury
if
we
are
to
believe
the
accounts
of
those
who
saw
him
in
his
simple
house
with
its
almost
austere
appointments
in
his
little
room
with
its
iron
bed
its
cheap
chairs
and
its
naked
walls
but
even
this
poor
comfort
weighed
upon
him
it
was
a
cause
of
perpetual
remorse
in
the
second
of
the
tales
published
by
the
de
he
bitterly
contrasts
the
spectacle
of
the
poverty
about
him
with
the
luxury
of
his
own
house
my
activity
he
wrote
as
early
as
however
useful
it
may
appear
to
certain
people
loses
the
greater
part
of
its
importance
by
the
fact
that
my
life
is
not
entirely
in
agreement
with
my
professions
why
did
he
not
realise
this
agreement
if
he
could
not
induce
his
family
to
cut
themselves
off
from
the
world
why
did
he
not
leave
them
go
out
of
their
life
thus
avoiding
the
sarcasm
and
the
reproach
of
hypocrisy
expressed
by
his
enemies
who
were
only
too
glad
to
follow
his
example
and
make
it
an
excuse
for
denying
his
doctrines
he
had
thought
of
so
doing
for
a
long
time
he
was
quite
resolved
a
remarkable
letter
of
his
has
recently
been
found
and
published
it
was
written
to
his
wife
on
the
of
june
the
greater
part
of
it
is
printed
below
nothing
could
better
express
the
secret
of
this
loving
and
unhappy
heart
for
a
long
time
dear
sophie
i
have
been
suffering
from
the
discord
between
my
life
and
my
beliefs
i
can
not
force
you
to
change
your
life
or
your
habits
neither
have
i
hitherto
been
able
to
leave
you
for
i
felt
that
by
my
departure
i
should
deprive
the
children
still
very
young
of
the
little
influence
i
might
be
able
to
exert
over
them
and
also
that
i
should
cause
you
all
a
great
deal
of
pain
but
i
can
not
continue
to
live
as
i
have
lived
during
these
last
sixteen
years
now
struggling
against
you
and
irritating
you
now
succumbing
myself
to
the
influences
and
the
seductions
to
which
i
am
accustomed
and
which
surround
me
i
have
resolved
now
to
do
what
i
have
wished
to
do
for
a
long
time
to
go
away
just
as
the
hindoos
when
they
arrive
at
their
sixtieth
year
go
away
into
the
forest
just
as
every
aged
and
religious
man
wishes
to
consecrate
the
last
years
of
his
life
to
god
and
not
to
jesting
punning
family
and
so
do
i
with
all
my
strength
desire
peace
and
solitude
and
if
not
an
absolute
harmony
at
least
not
this
crying
discord
between
my
whole
life
and
my
conscience
if
i
had
gone
away
openly
there
would
have
been
supplications
discussions
arguments
i
should
have
weakened
and
perhaps
i
should
not
have
carried
out
my
decision
and
it
ought
to
be
carried
out
i
beg
you
therefore
to
forgive
me
if
my
action
grieves
you
and
you
in
particular
sophie
let
me
go
do
not
try
to
find
me
do
not
be
angry
with
me
and
do
not
blame
me
the
fact
that
i
have
left
you
does
not
prove
that
i
have
any
grievance
against
you
i
know
that
you
not
could
see
and
think
with
me
this
is
why
you
could
not
change
your
life
could
not
sacrifice
yourself
to
something
you
did
not
understand
i
do
not
blame
you
at
all
on
the
contrary
i
remember
with
love
and
gratitude
the
long
years
of
our
life
together
and
above
all
the
first
half
of
that
period
when
with
the
courage
and
devotion
of
your
mother
nature
you
valiantly
fulfilled
what
you
saw
as
your
mission
you
have
given
to
me
and
the
world
what
you
had
to
give
you
have
given
much
maternal
love
and
made
great
sacrifices
but
in
the
latter
period
of
our
life
in
the
last
fifteen
years
our
paths
have
lain
apart
i
can
not
believe
that
i
am
the
guilty
one
i
know
that
i
have
changed
it
was
not
your
doing
nor
the
world
it
was
because
i
could
not
do
otherwise
i
can
not
blame
you
for
not
having
followed
me
and
i
shall
always
remember
with
love
what
you
have
given
me
goodbye
my
dear
sophie
i
love
you
fact
that
i
have
left
he
did
not
leave
her
poor
letter
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
enough
to
write
and
his
resolution
would
be
fulfilled
having
written
his
resolution
was
already
exhausted
if
i
had
gone
away
openly
there
would
have
been
supplications
i
should
have
weakened
there
was
no
need
of
supplications
of
discussion
it
was
enough
for
him
to
see
a
moment
later
those
whom
he
wished
to
leave
he
felt
that
he
not
could
leave
them
and
he
took
the
letter
in
his
pocket
and
buried
it
among
his
papers
with
this
subscription
give
this
after
my
death
to
my
wife
sophie
andreyevna
and
this
was
the
end
of
his
plan
of
departure
was
he
not
strong
enough
was
he
not
capable
of
sacrificing
his
affections
to
his
god
in
the
christian
annals
there
is
no
lack
of
saints
with
tougher
hearts
who
never
hesitated
to
trample
fearlessly
underfoot
both
their
own
affections
and
those
of
others
but
how
could
he
he
was
not
of
their
company
he
was
weak
he
was
a
man
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
love
him
more
than
fifteen
years
earlier
on
a
page
full
of
wretchedness
he
had
asked
himself
well
leo
tolstoy
are
you
living
according
to
the
principles
you
profess
he
replied
miserably
i
am
dying
of
shame
i
am
guilty
i
am
contemptible
yet
compare
my
former
life
with
my
life
of
you
will
see
that
i
am
trying
to
live
according
to
the
laws
of
god
i
have
not
done
the
thousandth
part
of
what
i
ought
to
do
and
i
am
confused
but
i
have
failed
to
do
it
not
because
i
did
not
wish
to
do
it
but
because
i
could
not
blame
me
but
not
the
path
i
am
taking
if
i
know
the
road
to
my
house
and
if
i
stagger
along
it
like
a
drunken
man
does
that
show
that
the
road
is
bad
show
me
another
or
follow
me
along
the
true
path
as
i
am
ready
to
follow
you
but
do
not
discourage
me
do
not
rejoice
in
my
distress
do
not
joyfully
cry
out
he
said
he
was
going
to
the
house
and
he
is
falling
into
the
ditch
no
do
not
be
glad
but
help
me
support
me
help
me
my
heart
is
torn
with
despair
lest
we
should
all
be
astray
and
when
i
make
every
effort
to
escape
you
at
each
effort
instead
of
having
compassion
point
at
me
with
your
finger
crying
he
is
falling
into
the
ditch
with
us
when
death
was
nearer
he
wrote
once
more
i
am
not
a
saint
i
have
never
professed
to
be
one
i
am
a
man
who
allows
himself
to
be
carried
away
and
who
often
does
not
say
all
that
he
thinks
and
feels
not
because
he
does
not
want
to
but
because
he
can
not
because
it
often
happens
that
he
exaggerates
or
is
mistaken
in
my
actions
it
is
still
worse
i
am
altogether
a
weak
man
with
vicious
habits
who
wishes
to
serve
the
god
of
truth
but
who
is
constantly
stumbling
if
i
am
considered
as
a
man
who
can
not
be
mistaken
then
each
of
my
mistakes
must
appear
as
a
lie
or
a
hypocrisy
but
if
i
am
regarded
as
a
weak
man
i
appear
then
what
i
am
in
reality
a
pitiable
creature
yet
sincere
who
has
constantly
and
with
all
his
soul
desired
and
who
still
desires
to
become
a
good
man
a
good
servant
of
god
thus
he
remained
tormented
by
remorse
pursued
by
the
mute
reproaches
of
disciples
more
energetic
and
less
human
than
himself
tortured
by
his
weakness
and
indecision
torn
between
the
love
of
his
family
and
the
love
of
god
until
the
day
when
a
sudden
fit
of
despair
and
perhaps
the
fever
which
rises
at
the
approach
of
death
drove
him
forth
from
the
shelter
of
his
house
out
upon
the
roads
wandering
fleeing
knocking
at
the
doors
of
a
convent
then
resuming
his
flight
and
at
last
falling
upon
the
way
in
an
obscure
little
village
never
to
rise
again
on
his
he
wept
not
for
himself
but
for
the
unhappy
and
he
said
in
the
midst
of
his
sobs
there
are
millions
of
human
beings
on
earth
who
are
suffering
why
do
you
think
only
of
me
then
it
came
it
was
sunday
november
a
little
after
six
in
the
morning
the
deliverance
as
he
named
it
death

letter
to
the

tolstoy
expressed
a
fear
that
this
might
happen
in
the
above
letter
it
was
hardly
worth
while
to
refuse
military
and
police
service
only
to
revert
to
property
which
is
maintained
only
by
those
two
services
those
who
enter
the
service
and
profit
by
property
act
better
than
those
who
refuse
all
service
and
enjoy
property

papers
after

letter
to
a
friend
the
french
version
being
published
in
cruels
it
seems
that
during
his
last
few
years
and
especially
during
the
last
few
months
he
was
influenced
by
tchertkoff
a
devoted
friend
who
long
established
in
england
had
consecrated
his
fortune
to
the
publication
and
distribution
of
tolstoy
complete
works
tchertkoff
had
been
violently
attacked
by
leo
tolstoy
eldest
son
but
although
he
was
accused
of
being
a
rebellious
and
unmanageable
spirit
no
one
could
doubt
his
absolute
devotion
and
without
approving
of
the
almost
inhuman
harshness
of
certain
actions
apparently
committed
under
his
inspiration
such
as
the
will
by
which
tolstoy
deprived
his
wife
of
all
property
in
his
writings
without
exception
including
his
private
correspondence
we
are
forced
to
believe
that
he
thought
more
of
tolstoy
fame
than
tolstoy

suddenly
on
october
november
european
style
about
five
in
the
morning
he
was
accompanied
by
makovitski
his
daughter
alexandra
whom
tchertkoff
calls
his
most
intimate
collaborator
was
in
the
secret
at
six
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
he
reached
the
monastery
of
optina
one
of
the
most
celebrated
sanctuaries
of
russia
which
he
had
often
visited
in
pilgrimage
he
passed
the
night
there
the
next
morning
he
wrote
a
long
article
on
the
death
penalty
on
the
evening
of
october
november
he
went
to
the
monastery
of
chamordino
where
his
sister
marie
was
a
nun
he
dined
with
her
and
spoke
of
how
he
would
have
wished
to
pass
the
end
of
his
life
at
optina
performing
the
humblest
tasks
on
condition
that
he
was
not
forced
to
go
to
church
he
slept
at
chamordino
and
next
morning
took
a
walk
through
the
neighbouring
village
where
he
thought
of
taking
a
lodging
returning
to
his
sister
in
the
afternoon
at
five
his
daughter
alexandra
unexpectedly
arrived
she
doubtless
told
him
that
his
retreat
was
known
and
that
he
was
being
followed
they
left
at
once
in
the
night
tolstoy
alexandra
and
makovitski
were
making
for
the

probably
intending
to
gain
the

or
perhaps
the
doukhobor

conclusion
the
struggle
was
ended
the
struggle
that
had
lasted
for
years
whose
battlefield
was
this
life
of
ours
a
tragic
and
glorious
mellay
in
which
all
the
forces
of
life
took
part
all
the
vices
and
all
the
all
the
vices
excepting
one
untruth
which
he
pursued
incessantly
tracking
it
into
its
last
resort
and
refuge
in
the
beginning
intoxicated
liberty
the
conflict
of
passions
in
the
stormy
darkness
illuminated
from
time
to
time
by
dazzling
flashes
of
light
crises
of
love
and
ecstasy
and
visions
of
the
eternal
years
of
the
caucasus
of
sebastopol
years
of
tumultuous
and
restless
youth
then
the
great
peace
of
the
first
years
of
marriage
the
happiness
of
love
of
art
of
war
and
the
broad
daylight
of
genius
which
bathed
the
whole
human
horizon
and
the
spectacle
of
those
struggles
which
for
the
soul
of
the
artist
were
already
things
of
the
past
he
dominated
them
was
master
of
them
and
already
they
were
not
enough
like
prince
andrei
his
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
vast
skies
which
shone
above
the
battlefield
it
was
this
sky
that
attracted
him
there
are
men
with
powerful
wings
whom
pleasure
leads
to
alight
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
when
their
pinions
are
broken
such
for
instance
am
i
then
they
beat
their
broken
wings
they
launch
themselves
desperately
but
fall
anew
the
wings
will
mend
i
shall
fly
high
may
god
help
me
these
words
were
written
in
the
midst
of
a
terrible
spiritual
tempest
of
which
the
are
the
memory
and
echo
more
than
once
was
tolstoy
thrown
to
earth
his
pinions
shattered
but
he
always
persevered
he
started
afresh
we
see
him
hovering
in
the
vast
profound
heavens
with
his
two
great
wings
of
which
one
is
reason
and
the
other
faith
but
he
does
not
find
the
peace
he
looked
for
heaven
is
not
without
us
but
within
us
tolstoy
fills
it
with
the
tempest
of
his
passions
there
he
perceives
the
apostles
of
renunciation
and
he
brings
to
renunciation
the
same
ardour
that
he
brought
to
life
but
it
is
always
life
that
he
strains
to
him
with
the
violence
of
a
lover
he
is
maddened
with
life
he
is
intoxicated
with
life
he
can
not
live
without
this
madness
he
is
drunk
at
once
with
happiness
and
with
unhappiness
with
death
and
with
immortality
his
renunciation
of
individual
life
is
only
a
cry
of
exalted
passion
towards
the
eternal
life
the
peace
which
he
finds
the
peace
of
the
soul
which
he
invokes
is
not
the
peace
of
death
it
is
rather
the
calm
of
those
burning
worlds
which
sail
by
the
forces
of
gravity
through
the
infinite
spaces
with
him
anger
is
calm
and
the
calm
is
blazing
faith
has
given
him
new
weapons
with
which
to
wage
even
more
implacably
unceasing
war
upon
the
lies
of
modern
society
he
no
longer
confines
himself
to
a
few
types
of
romance
he
attacks
all
the
great
idols
the
hypocrisies
of
religion
the
state
science
art
liberalism
socialism
popular
education
benevolence
pacificism
he
strikes
at
all
delivers
his
desperate
attacks
upon
all
from
time
to
time
the
world
has
sight
of
these
great
rebellious
spirits
who
like
john
the
forerunner
hurl
anathemas
against
a
corrupted
civilisation
the
last
of
these
was
rousseau
by
his
love
of
nature
by
his
hatred
of
modern
society
by
his
jealous
independence
by
his
fervent
adoration
of
the
gospel
and
for
christian
morals
rousseau
is
a
precursor
of
tolstoy
who
says
of
him
pages
like
this
go
to
my
heart
i
feel
that
i
should
have
written
them
but
what
a
difference
between
the
two
minds
and
how
much
more
purely
christian
is
tolstoy
what
a
lack
of
humility
what
arrogance
in
this
insolent
cry
from
the
of
the
genevese
eternal
being
let
a
single
man
tell
me
if
he
dare
i
was
better
than
that
man
or
in
this
defiance
of
the
world
i
say
it
loudly
and
fearlessly
whosoever
could
believe
me
a
dishonest
man
is
himself
a
man
to
be
suppressed
tolstoy
wept
tears
of
blood
over
the
crimes
of
his
past
life
i
suffer
the
pangs
of
hell
i
recall
all
my
past
baseness
and
these
memories
do
not
leave
me
they
poison
my
life
usually
men
regret
that
they
can
not
remember
after
death
what
happiness
if
it
should
be
so
what
suffering
it
would
mean
if
in
that
other
life
i
were
to
recall
all
the
evil
i
have
done
down
here
tolstoy
was
not
the
man
to
write
his
confessions
as
did
rousseau
because
as
the
latter
said
feeling
that
the
good
exceeded
the
evil
it
was
in
my
interest
to
tell
everything
tolstoy
after
having
made
the
attempt
decided
not
to
write
his
the
pen
fell
from
his
hands
he
did
not
wish
to
be
an
object
of
offence
and
scandal
to
those
who
would
read
it
people
would
say
there
then
is
the
man
whom
many
set
so
high
and
what
a
shameful
fellow
he
was
then
with
us
mere
mortals
it
is
god
who
ordains
us
to
be
shameful
never
did
rousseau
know
the
christian
faith
the
fine
modesty
and
the
humility
that
produced
the
ineffable
candour
of
the
aged
tolstoy
behind
rousseau
we
see
the
rome
of
calvin
in
tolstoy
we
see
the
pilgrims
the
innocents
whose
tears
and
naive
confessions
had
touched
him
as
a
child
but
beyond
and
above
the
struggle
with
the
world
which
was
common
to
him
and
to
rousseau
another
kind
of
warfare
filled
the
last
thirty
years
of
tolstoy
life
a
magnificent
warfare
between
the
highest
powers
of
his
mind
truth
and
love
truth
that
look
which
goes
straight
to
the
heart
the
penetrating
light
of
those
grey
eyes
which
pierce
you
through
truth
was
his
earliest
faith
and
the
empress
of
his
art
the
heroine
of
my
writings
she
whom
i
love
with
all
the
forces
of
my
being
she
who
always
was
is
and
will
be
beautiful
is
truth
the
truth
alone
escaped
shipwreck
after
the
death
of
his
brother
the
truth
the
pivot
of
his
life
the
rock
in
the
midst
of
an
ocean
but
very
soon
the
horrible
truth
was
no
longer
enough
for
him
love
had
supplanted
it
it
was
the
living
spring
of
his
childhood
the
natural
state
of
his
soul
when
the
moral
crisis
of
came
he
never
relinquished
the
truth
he
made
way
for
love
love
is
the
basis
of
energy
love
is
the
reason
of
life
the
only
reason
with
beauty
love
is
the
essence
of
tolstoy
ripened
by
life
of
the
author
of
and
and
the
to
the
holy
this
interpenetration
of
the
truth
by
love
makes
the
unique
value
of
the
masterpieces
he
wrote
in
the
middle
part
of
his
life
mezzo
del
and
distinguishes
his
realism
from
the
realism
of
flaubert
the
latter
places
his
faith
in
refraining
from
loving
his
characters
great
as
he
may
be
he
lacks
the
lux
the
light
of
the
sun
is
not
enough
we
must
have
the
light
of
the
heart
the
realism
of
tolstoy
is
incarnate
in
each
of
his
creatures
and
seeing
them
with
their
own
eyes
he
finds
in
the
vilest
reasons
for
loving
them
and
for
making
us
feel
the
chain
of
brotherhood
which
unites
us
to
all
by
love
he
penetrates
to
the
roots
of
life
but
this
union
is
a
difficult
one
to
maintain
there
are
hours
in
which
the
spectacle
of
life
and
its
suffering
are
so
bitter
that
they
appear
an
affront
to
love
and
in
order
to
save
it
and
to
save
his
faith
a
man
must
withdraw
to
such
a
height
above
the
world
that
faith
is
in
danger
of
losing
truth
as
well
what
shall
he
do
moreover
who
has
received
at
the
hands
of
fate
the
fatal
magnificent
gift
of
seeing
the
truth
the
gift
of
being
unable
to
escape
from
seeing
it
who
shall
say
what
tolstoy
suffered
from
the
continual
discord
of
his
latter
years
the
discord
between
his
unpitying
vision
which
saw
the
horror
of
reality
and
his
impassioned
heart
which
continued
to
expect
love
and
to
affirm
it
we
have
all
known
these
tragic
conflicts
how
often
have
we
had
to
face
the
alternative
not
to
see
or
to
hate
and
how
often
does
an
artist
an
artist
worthy
of
the
name
a
writer
who
knows
the
terrible
magnificent
power
of
the
written
word
feel
himself
weighed
down
by
anguish
as
he
writes
the
truth
this
truth
sane
and
virile
necessary
in
the
midst
of
modern
lies
this
vital
truth
seems
to
him
as
the
air
we
breathe
but
then
we
perceive
that
this
air
is
more
than
the
lungs
of
many
can
bear
it
is
too
strong
for
the
many
beings
enfeebled
by
civilisation
too
strong
for
those
who
are
weak
simply
in
the
kindness
of
their
hearts
are
we
to
take
no
account
of
this
and
plunge
them
implacably
into
the
truth
that
kills
them
is
there
not
above
all
a
truth
which
as
tolstoy
says
is
open
to
love
or
is
the
artist
to
soothe
mankind
with
consoling
lies
as
peer
gynt
with
his
tales
soothes
his
old
dying
mother
society
is
always
face
to
face
with
this
dilemma
the
truth
or
love
it
resolves
it
in
general
by
sacrificing
both
tolstoy
has
never
betrayed
either
of
his
two
faiths
in
the
works
of
his
maturity
love
is
the
torch
of
truth
in
the
works
of
his
later
years
it
is
a
light
shining
on
high
a
ray
of
mercy
which
falls
upon
life
but
does
not
mingle
with
it
we
have
seen
this
in
wherein
faith
dominates
the
reality
but
remains
external
to
it
the
people
whom
tolstoy
depicts
as
commonplace
and
mean
when
he
regards
the
isolated
figures
that
compose
it
takes
on
a
divine
sanctity
so
soon
as
he
considers
it
in
the
abstract
in
his
everyday
life
appears
the
same
discord
as
in
his
art
but
the
contrast
is
even
more
cruel
it
was
in
vain
that
he
knew
what
love
required
of
him
he
acted
otherwise
he
lived
not
according
to
god
but
according
to
the
world
and
love
itself
how
was
he
to
behave
with
regard
to
love
how
distinguish
between
its
many
aspects
its
contradictory
orders
was
love
of
family
to
come
first
or
love
of
all
humanity
to
his
last
day
he
was
perplexed
by
these
alternatives
what
was
the
solution
he
did
not
find
it
let
us
leave
the
the
coldly
intellectual
to
judge
him
with
disdain
they
to
be
sure
have
found
the
truth
they
hold
it
with
assurance
for
them
tolstoy
was
a
sentimentalist
a
weakling
who
could
only
be
of
use
as
a
warning
certainly
he
is
not
an
example
that
they
can
follow
they
are
not
sufficiently
alive
tolstoy
did
not
belong
to
the
elect
he
was
of
no
church
of
no
sect
he
was
no
more
a
scribe
to
borrow
his
terms
than
a
pharisee
of
this
faith
or
that
he
was
the
highest
type
of
the
free
christian
who
strives
all
his
life
long
towards
an
ideal
that
is
always
more
remote
tolstoy
does
not
speak
to
the
privileged
the
enfranchised
of
the
world
of
thought
he
speaks
to
ordinary
hominibus
bonæ
he
is
our
conscience
he
says
what
we
all
think
we
average
people
and
what
we
all
fear
to
read
in
ourselves
he
is
not
a
master
full
of
pride
one
of
those
haughty
geniuses
who
are
throned
above
humanity
upon
their
art
and
their
intelligence
he
is
as
he
loved
to
style
himself
in
his
letters
by
that
most
beautiful
of
titles
the
most
pleasant
of
all
our
brother
dated
october
here
is
the
entire
passage
there
are
in
this
world
heavy
folk
without
wings
they
struggle
down
below
there
are
strong
men
among
them
as
napoleon
he
leaves
terrible
traces
among
humanity
he
sows
there
are
men
who
let
their
wings
grow
slowly
launch
themselves
and
hover
the
monks
there
are
light
fliers
who
easily
mount
and
fall
the
worthy
idealists
there
are
men
with
powerful
wings
there
are
the
celestial
ones
who
out
of
their
love
of
men
descend
to
earth
and
fold
their
wings
and
teach
others
how
to
fly
then
when
they
are
no
longer
needed
they
as
did
christ
one
can
live
only
while
one
is
drunken
with
life
i
am
mad
with
living
it
is
summer
the
delicious
summer
this
year
i
have
struggled
for
a
long
time
but
the
beauty
of
nature
has
conquered
me
i
rejoice
in
life
letter
to
fet
july
these
lines
were
written
at
the
height
of
the
religious
crisis
in
his
dated
may
the
thought
of
death
i
desire
and
love
immortality
i
was
intoxicated
with
that
boiling
anger
and
indignation
which
i
love
to
feel
which
i
excite
even
when
i
feel
it
naturally
because
it
acts
upon
me
in
such
a
way
as
to
calm
me
and
gives
me
at
least
for
a
few
moments
an
extraordinary
elasticity
and
the
full
fire
and
energy
of
all
the
physical
and
moral
capacities
of
prince
nekhludov
lucerne
his
article
on
written
on
the
occasion
of
the
universal
peace
congress
in
london
in
is
a
rude
satire
on
the
peacemakers
who
believe
in
international
arbitration
this
is
the
story
of
the
bird
which
is
caught
after
a
pinch
of
salt
has
been
put
on
his
tail
it
is
quite
as
easy
to
catch
him
without
it
they
laugh
at
us
who
speak
of
arbitration
and
disarmament
by
consent
of
the
powers
mere
verbiage
this
naturally
the
governments
approve
worthy
apostles
they
know
very
well
that
their
approval
will
never
prevent
their
doing
as
they
will
nature
was
always
the
best
friend
of
tolstoy
as
he
loved
to
say
a
friend
is
good
but
he
will
die
or
he
will
go
abroad
and
one
can
not
follow
him
while
nature
to
which
one
may
be
united
by
an
act
of
purchase
or
by
inheritance
is
better
nature
to
me
is
cold
and
exacting
repulses
me
and
hinders
me
yet
nature
is
a
friend
whom
we
keep
until
death
and
into
whom
we
shall
enter
when
we
die
letter
to
fet
may
he
shared
in
the
life
of
nature
he
was
born
again
in
the
spring
march
and
april
are
my
best
months
for
work
towards
the
end
of
autumn
he
became
more
torpid
to
me
it
is
the
most
dead
of
all
the
seasons
i
do
not
think
i
do
not
write
i
feel
agreeably
stupid
to
fet
october
but
the
nature
that
spoke
so
intimately
to
his
heart
was
that
of
his
own
home
yasnaya
polyana
although
he
wrote
some
very
charming
notes
upon
the
lake
of
geneva
when
travelling
in
switzerland
and
especially
on
the
clarens
district
whither
the
memory
of
rousseau
attracted
him
he
felt
himself
a
stranger
amid
the
swiss
landscape
and
the
ties
of
his
native
land
appeared
more
closely
drawn
and
sweeter
i
love
nature
when
she
surrounds
me
on
every
side
when
on
every
hand
the
warm
air
envelopes
me
which
extends
through
the
infinite
distance
when
the
very
same
lush
grasses
that
i
have
crushed
in
throwing
myself
on
the
ground
make
the
verdure
of
the
infinite
meadows
when
the
same
leaves
which
shaken
by
the
wind
throw
the
shadow
on
my
face
make
the
sombre
blue
of
the
distant
forest
when
the
very
air
i
breathe
makes
the
background
of
the
infinite
sky
when
not
i
alone
am
delighting
in
nature
when
around
me
whirl
and
hum
millions
of
insects
and
the
birds
are
singing
the
greatest
delight
in
nature
is
when
i
feel
myself
making
a
part
of
all
here
in
switzerland
the
infinite
distance
is
beautiful
but
i
have
nothing
in
common
with
it
may
conversations
with
paul
boyer
le
temps
august
the
similarity
is
really
very
striking
at
times
and
might
well
deceive
one
take
the
profession
of
faith
of
the
dying
julie
i
could
not
say
that
i
believed
what
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
believe
and
i
have
always
believed
what
i
said
i
believed
this
was
as
much
as
rested
with
me
compare
tolstoy
letter
to
the
holy
synod
it
may
be
that
my
beliefs
are
embarrassing
or
displeasing
it
is
not
within
my
power
to
change
them
just
as
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
change
my
body
i
can
not
believe
anything
but
what
i
believe
at
this
hour
when
i
am
preparing
to
return
to
that
god
from
whom
i
came
or
this
passage
from
the
à
christophe
de
beaumont
which
seems
pure
tolstoy
i
am
a
disciple
of
jesus
christ
my
master
has
told
me
that
he
who
loves
his
brother
accomplishes
the
law
or
again
the
whole
of
the
lord
prayer
is
expressed
in
these
words
will
be
done
lettre
de
la
compare
with
i
am
replacing
all
my
prayers
with
the
all
the
requests
i
can
make
of
god
are
expressed
with
greater
moral
elevation
by
these
words
will
be
done
tolstoy
in
the
caucasus
the
similarity
of
thought
is
no
less
striking
in
the
province
of
art
the
first
rule
of
the
art
of
writing
said
rousseau
is
to
speak
plainly
and
to
express
one
thought
exactly
and
tolstoy
think
what
you
will
but
in
such
a
manner
that
every
word
may
be
understood
by
all
one
can
not
write
anything
bad
in
perfectly
plain
language
i
have
demonstrated
elsewhere
that
the
satirical
descriptions
of
the
paris
opera
in
the
have
much
in
common
with
tolstoy
criticisms
in
is
art
january
letter
to
birukov
in
may
the
truth
the
only
thing
that
has
been
left
me
of
my
moral
conceptions
the
sole
thing
that
i
shall
still
fulfil
october
the
love
of
men
is
the
natural
state
of
the
soul
and
we
do
not
observe
it
while
he
was
a
student
at
kazan
the
truth
will
make
way
for
love
are
always
talking
of
energy
but
the
basis
of
energy
is
love
said
anna
love
does
not
come
at
will
beauty
and
love
those
two
sole
reasons
for
human
existence
and
i
believe
in
god
who
for
me
is
love
the
holy
synod
love
not
selfish
love
but
love
as
i
knew
it
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
when
i
saw
my
enemy
dying
at
my
side
and
loved
him
it
is
the
very
essence
of
the
soul
to
love
his
neighbour
to
love
his
enemies
to
love
all
and
each
is
to
love
god
in
all
his
manifestations
to
love
a
creature
who
is
dear
to
us
is
human
love
to
love
an
enemy
is
almost
divine
love
prince
andrei
in
and
the
passionate
love
of
the
artist
for
his
subject
is
the
soul
of
art
without
love
no
work
of
art
is
possible
letter

september

which
is
why
i
know
all
the
evil
they
do
letter
to
veriguin
leader
of
the
doukhobors
see
the
proprietor
or
see
in
the
strongly
idealised
view
of
these
men
simple
good
content
with
their
lot
living
serenely
and
having
the
sense
of
life
or
at
the
end
of
the
second
part
of
that
vision
of
a
new
humanity
a
new
world
which
appeared
to
nekhludov
when
he
met
the
workers
returning
from
their
toil
a
christian
should
not
think
whether
he
is
morally
superior
or
inferior
to
others
but
he
is
the
better
christian
as
he
travels
more
rapidly
along
the
road
to
perfection
whatever
may
be
his
position
upon
it
at
any
particular
moment
thus
the
stationary
virtue
of
the
pharisee
is
less
christian
than
that
of
the
thief
whose
soul
is
moving
rapidly
towards
the
