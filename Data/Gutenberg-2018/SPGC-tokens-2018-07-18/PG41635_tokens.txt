chapter
i
the
start
the
vale
of
kashmir
is
too
well
known
to
require
description
it
is
the
of
the
sportsman
and
tourist
the
resort
of
artists
and
invalids
the
home
of
shawls
and
exquisitely
embroidered
fabrics
and
the
land
of
lalla
rookh
its
inhabitants
chiefly
moslems
infamously
governed
by
hindus
are
a
feeble
race
attracting
little
interest
valuable
to
travellers
as
or
porters
and
repulsive
to
them
from
the
mingled
cunning
and
obsequiousness
which
have
been
fostered
by
ages
of
oppression
but
even
for
them
there
is
the
dawn
of
hope
for
the
church
missionary
society
has
a
strong
medical
and
educational
mission
at
the
capital
a
hospital
and
dispensary
under
the
charge
of
a
lady
have
been
opened
for
women
and
a
capable
and
upright
officer
lent
by
the
indian
government
is
investigating
the
iniquitous
land
arrangements
with
a
view
to
a
just
settlement
i
left
the
panjāb
railroad
system
at
rawul
pindi
bought
my
camp
equipage
and
travelled
through
the
grand
ravines
which
lead
to
kashmir
or
the
jhelum
valley
by
on
horseback
and
by
reaching
srinagar
at
the
end
of
april
when
the
velvet
lawns
were
at
their
greenest
and
the
foliage
was
at
its
freshest
and
the
mountains
which
enclose
this
fairest
gem
of
the
himalayas
still
wore
their
winter
mantle
of
unsullied
snow
making
srinagar
my
headquarters
i
spent
two
months
in
travelling
in
kashmir
half
the
time
in
a
native
on
the
jhelum
and
pohru
rivers
and
the
other
half
on
horseback
camping
wherever
the
scenery
was
most
attractive
by
the
middle
of
june
mosquitos
were
rampant
the
grass
was
tawny
a
brown
dust
haze
hung
over
the
valley
the
of
a
multitude
glared
through
the
hot
nights
and
misty
moonlight
of
the
munshibagh
english
tents
dotted
the
landscape
there
was
no
mountain
valley
or
plateau
however
remote
free
from
the
clatter
of
english
voices
and
the
trained
servility
of
hindu
servants
and
even
sonamarg
at
an
altitude
of
feet
and
rough
of
access
had
capitulated
to
to
a
traveller
this
hubbub
was
intolerable
and
i
left
srinagar
and
many
kind
friends
on
june
for
the
uplifted
plateaux
of
lesser
tibet
my
party
consisted
of
myself
a
thoroughly
competent
servant
and
passable
interpreter
hassan
khan
a
panjābi
a
of
whom
the
less
that
is
said
the
better
and
mando
a
kashmiri
lad
a
common
coolie
who
under
hassan
khan
training
developed
into
an
efficient
travelling
servant
and
later
into
a
smart
gyalpo
my
horse
must
not
be
forgotten
indeed
he
can
not
be
for
he
left
the
marks
of
his
heels
or
teeth
on
every
one
he
was
a
beautiful
creature
badakshani
bred
of
arab
blood
a
as
light
as
a
greyhound
and
as
strong
as
a
he
was
higher
in
the
scale
of
intellect
than
any
horse
of
my
acquaintance
his
cleverness
at
times
suggested
reasoning
power
and
his
mischievousness
a
sense
of
humour
he
walked
five
miles
an
hour
jumped
like
a
deer
climbed
like
a
was
strong
and
steady
in
perilous
fords
tireless
hardy
hungry
frolicked
along
ledges
of
precipices
and
over
crevassed
glaciers
was
absolutely
fearless
and
his
slender
legs
and
the
use
he
made
of
them
were
the
marvel
of
all
he
was
an
enigma
to
the
end
he
was
quite
untamable
rejected
all
dainties
with
indignation
swung
his
heels
into
faces
when
they
went
near
him
ran
at
them
with
his
teeth
seized
unwary
by
their
and
shook
them
as
a
dog
shakes
a
rat
would
let
no
one
go
near
him
but
mando
for
whom
he
formed
at
first
sight
a
most
singular
attachment
but
kicked
and
struck
with
his
forefeet
his
eyes
all
the
time
dancing
with
fun
so
that
one
could
never
decide
whether
his
ceaseless
pranks
were
play
or
vice
he
was
always
tethered
in
front
of
my
tent
with
a
rope
twenty
feet
long
which
left
him
practically
free
he
was
as
good
as
a
watchdog
and
his
antics
and
enigmatical
savagery
were
the
life
and
terror
of
the
camp
i
was
never
weary
of
watching
him
the
curves
of
his
form
were
so
exquisite
his
movements
so
lithe
and
rapid
his
small
head
and
restless
little
ears
so
full
of
life
and
expression
the
variations
in
his
manner
so
frequent
one
moment
savagely
attacking
some
unwary
stranger
with
a
scream
of
rage
the
next
laying
his
lovely
head
against
mando
cheek
with
a
soft
cooing
sound
and
a
childlike
gentleness
when
he
was
attacking
anybody
or
frolicking
his
movements
and
beauty
can
only
be
described
by
a
phrase
of
the
apostle
james
grace
of
the
fashion
of
it
colonel
durand
of
gilgit
celebrity
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
many
other
kindnesses
gave
him
to
me
in
exchange
for
a
cowardly
heavy
yarkand
horse
and
had
previously
vainly
tried
to
tame
him
his
wild
eyes
were
like
those
of
a
seagull
he
had
no
kinship
with
humanity
in
addition
i
had
as
escort
an
afghan
or
pathan
a
soldier
of
the
maharajah
irregular
force
of
foreign
mercenaries
who
had
been
sent
to
meet
me
when
i
entered
kashmir
this
man
usman
shah
was
a
stage
ruffian
in
appearance
he
wore
a
turban
of
prodigious
height
ornamented
with
poppies
or
birds
feathers
loved
fantastic
colours
and
ceaseless
change
of
raiment
walked
in
front
of
me
carrying
a
big
sword
over
his
shoulder
plundered
and
beat
the
people
terrified
the
women
and
was
eventually
recognised
at
leh
as
a
murderer
and
as
great
a
ruffian
in
reality
as
he
was
in
appearance
an
attendant
of
this
kind
is
a
mistake
the
brutality
and
rapacity
he
exercises
naturally
make
the
people
cowardly
or
surly
and
disinclined
to
trust
a
traveller
so
accompanied
finally
i
had
a
cabul
tent
in
by
weighing
with
poles
and
iron
pins
a
trestle
bed
and
cork
mattress
a
folding
table
and
chair
and
an
indian
as
a
carpet
my
servants
had
a
tent
in
square
weighing
only
which
served
as
a
shelter
tent
for
me
during
the
noonday
halt
a
kettle
copper
pot
and
frying
pan
a
few
enamelled
iron
table
equipments
bedding
clothing
working
and
sketching
materials
completed
my
outfit
the
servants
carried
wadded
quilts
for
beds
and
bedding
and
their
own
cooking
utensils
unwillingness
to
use
those
belonging
to
a
christian
being
nearly
the
last
rag
of
religion
which
they
retained
the
only
stores
i
carried
were
tea
a
quantity
of
edwards
desiccated
soup
and
a
little
saccharin
the
furniture
clothing
were
a
light
load
for
three
mules
engaged
at
a
shilling
a
day
each
including
the
muleteer
sheep
coarse
flour
milk
and
barley
were
procurable
at
very
moderate
prices

the

i
occupied
days
on

a

this
venice
of
the
himalayas
with
a
broad
rushing
river
for
its
high
street
and
winding
canals
for
its
back
streets
looked
so
entrancingly
beautiful
as
in
the
slant
sunshine
of
the
late
june
afternoon
the
light
fell
brightly
on
the
river
at
the

where
i
embarked
on

state
barges
with
their
painted
arabesques
gay
canopies
and
of
thirty

forty
paddling
men
on
the
gay
façade
and

of
the
palace
on
the
massive
deodar
bridges
which
for
centuries
have
defied
decay
and
the
fierce
flood
of

jhelum
and
on
the
quaintly
picturesque
wooden
architecture
and
carved
brown
lattice
fronts
of
the
houses
along
the
swirling
waterway
and
glanced
mirthfully
through
the
dense
leafage
of
the
superb
planes
which
overhang
the
water
but
the
mercury
was
in
the
shade
and
the
terrific
and
it
was
a
relief
when
the
boat
swung
round
a
corner
and
left
the
stir
of
the
broad
rapid
jhelum
for
a
still
narrow
and
sharply
winding
canal
which
intersects
a
part
of
srinagar
lying
between
the
jhelum
and
the
fort
of
hari
parbat
there
the
shadows
were
deep
and
chance
lights
alone
fell
on
the
red
dresses
of
the
women
at
the
ghats
and
on
the
shaven
shiny
heads
of
hundreds
of
amphibious
boys
who
were
swimming
and
aquatically
romping
in
the
canal
which
is
at
once
the
sewer
and
the
water
supply
of
the
district
several
hours
were
spent
in
a
slow
and
tortuous
progress
through
scenes
of
indescribable
picturesqueness
a
narrow
waterway
spanned
by
stone
bridges
some
of
them
with
houses
on
the
top
or
by
old
brown
wooden
bridges
festooned
with
vines
hemmed
in
by
lofty
stone
embankments
into
which
sculptured
stones
from
ancient
temples
are
wrought
on
the
top
of
which
are
houses
of
rich
men
fancifully
built
with
windows
of
fretwork
of
wood
or
gardens
with
kiosks
and
lower
embankments
sustaining
dwellings
rich
in
colour
and
fantastic
in
design
their
upper
fronts
projecting
over
the
water
and
supported
on
piles
there
were
gigantic
poplars
wreathed
with
vines
great
mulberry
trees
hanging
their
tempting
fruit
just
out
of
reach
huge
planes
overarching
the
water
their
dense
leafage
scraping
the
mat
roof
of
the
boat
filthy
ghats
thronged
with
moslems
performing
their
scanty
religious
ablutions
great
grain
boats
heavily
thatched
containing
not
only
families
but
their
sheep
and
poultry
and
all
the
other
sights
of
a
crowded
srinagar
waterway
the
houses
being
characteristically
distorted
and
out
of
repair
this
canal
gradually
widens
into
the
anchar
lake
a
reedy
mere
of
indefinite
boundaries
the
of
legions
of
mosquitos
and
after
the
tawny
twilight
darkened
into
a
stifling
night
we
made
fast
to
a
reed
bed
not
reaching
ganderbal
till
late
the
next
morning
where
my
horse
and
caravan
awaited
me
under
a
splendid
illustration
camp
at
gagangair
for
the
next
five
days
we
marched
up
the
sind
valley
one
of
the
most
beautiful
in
kashmir
from
its
grandeur
and
variety
beginning
among
quiet
and
brown
agricultural
villages
at
an
altitude
of
feet
the
track
usually
bad
and
sometimes
steep
and
perilous
passes
through
alpine
meadows
along
dark
gorges
above
the
booming
and
rushing
sind
through
woods
matted
with
the
sweet
white
jasmine
the
lower
hem
of
the
pine
and
deodar
forests
which
ascend
the
mountains
to
a
considerable
altitude
past
rifts
giving
glimpses
of
dazzling
over
grassy
slopes
dotted
with
villages
houses
and
shrines
embosomed
in
walnut
groves
in
sight
of
the
frowning
crags
of
haramuk
through
wooded
lanes
and
country
over
which
farms
are
thinly
scattered
over
unrailed
and
shaky
bridges
and
across
avalanche
slopes
till
it
reaches
gagangair
a
dream
of
lonely
beauty
with
a
of
velvety
sward
under
noble
above
this
place
the
valley
closes
in
between
walls
of
precipices
and
crags
which
rise
almost
abruptly
from
the
sind
to
heights
of
and
feet
the
road
in
many
places
is
only
a
series
of
steep
and
shelving
ledges
above
the
raging
river
natural
rock
smoothed
and
polished
into
riskiness
by
the
passage
for
centuries
of
the
trade
into
central
asia
from
western
india
kashmir
and
afghanistan
its
precariousness
for
animals
was
emphasised
to
me
by
five
serious
accidents
which
occurred
in
the
week
of
my
journey
one
of
them
involving
the
loss
of
the
money
clothing
and
sporting
kit
of
an
english
officer
bound
for
ladakh
for
three
months
above
this
tremendous
gorge
the
mountains
open
out
and
after
crossing
to
the
left
bank
of
the
sind
a
sharp
ascent
brought
me
to
the
beautiful
alpine
meadow
of
sonamarg
bright
with
spring
flowers
gleaming
with
crystal
streams
and
fringed
on
all
sides
by
deciduous
and
coniferous
trees
above
and
among
which
are
great
glaciers
and
the
snowy
peaks
of
tilail
fashion
has
deserted
sonamarg
rough
of
access
for
gulmarg
a
caprice
indicated
by
the
ruins
of
several
huts
and
of
a
church
the
pure
bracing
air
magnificent
views
the
proximity
and
accessibility
of
glaciers
and
the
presence
of
a
kind
friend
who
was
there
for
the
summer
made
sonamarg
a
very
pleasant
halt
before
entering
upon
the
supposed
severities
of
the
journey
to
lesser
tibet
illustration
sonamarg
the
five
days
march
though
propitious
and
full
of
the
charm
of
magnificent
scenery
had
opened
my
eyes
to
certain
unpleasantnesses
i
found
that
usman
shah
maltreated
the
villagers
and
not
only
robbed
them
of
their
best
fowls
but
requisitioned
all
manner
of
things
in
my
name
though
i
scrupulously
and
personally
paid
for
everything
beating
the
people
with
his
scabbarded
sword
if
they
showed
any
intention
of
standing
upon
their
rights
then
i
found
that
my
clever
factotum
not
content
with
the
legitimate
of
ten
per
was
charging
me
double
price
for
everything
and
paying
the
sellers
only
half
the
actual
price
this
legerdemain
being
perpetrated
in
my
presence
he
also
by
threats
got
back
from
the
coolies
half
their
day
wages
after
i
had
paid
them
received
money
for
barley
for
gyalpo
and
never
bought
it
a
fact
brought
to
light
by
the
growing
feebleness
of
the
horse
and
cheated
in
all
sorts
of
mean
and
plausible
ways
though
i
paid
him
exceptionally
high
wages
and
was
prepared
to
at
a
moderate
amount
of
dishonesty
so
long
as
it
affected
only
myself
it
has
a
lowering
influence
upon
one
to
live
in
a
fog
of
lies
and
fraud
and
the
attempt
to
checkmate
a
fraudulent
asiatic
ends
in
extreme
discomfiture
i
left
sonamarg
late
on
a
lovely
afternoon
for
a
short
march
through
alpine
meadows
to
baltal
the
last
in
kashmir
a
grassy
valley
at
the
foot
of
the
zoji
la
the
first
of
three
gigantic
steps
by
which
the
lofty
plateaux
of
central
asia
are
attained

the
road
a
large
affluent
of
the
sind
which
tumbles
down
a
gorge
in
broad
sheets
of
foam
has
to
be
crossed
my
a
rogue
was
either
or
pretended
to
be
so
and
in
spite
of
orders
to
the
contrary
led
gyalpo
upon
a
bridge
at
a
considerable
height
formed
of
two
poles
with
flat
pieces
of
stone
laid
loosely
over
them
not
more
than
a
foot
broad
as
the
horse
reached
the
middle
the
structure
gave
a
sort
of
turn
there
was
a
vision
of
hoofs
in
air
and
a
gleam
of
scarlet
and
gyalpo
the
hope
of
the
next
four
months
after
rolling
over
more
than
once
vanished
among
rocks
and
surges
of
the
wildest
description
he
kept
his
presence
of
mind
however
recovered
himself
and
by
a
desperate
effort
got
ashore
lower
down
with
legs
scratched
and
bleeding
and
one
horn
of
the
saddle
incurably
bent
maconochie
of
the
panjāb
civil
service
and
neve
of
the
medical
mission
in
kashmir
accompanied
me
from
sonamarg
over
the
pass
and
that
night
talked
seriously
to
usman
shah
on
the
subject
of
his
misconduct
and
with
such
singular
results
that
thereafter
i
had
little
cause
for
complaint
he
came
to
me
and
said
commissioner
sahib
thinks
i
give
mem
sahib
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
which
i
replied
in
a
cold
tone
care
you
do
give
me
any
more
the
gist
of
the
sahib
words
was
the
very
pertinent
suggestion
that
it
would
eventually
be
more
to
his
interest
to
serve
me
honestly
and
faithfully
than
to
cheat
me

within

miles
big
blazed
a
few
shepherds
lay
under
the
shelter
of
a

screen
the
silence
and
solitude
were
most
impressive
under
the
frosty
stars
and
the
great
central
asian
barrier
sunrise
the
following
morning
saw
us
on
the
way
up
a
huge
gorge
with
nearly
perpendicular
sides
and
filled
to
a
great
depth
with
snow
then
came
the
zoji
la
which
with
the
namika
la
and
the
fotu
la
respectively
and
feet
are
the
three
great
steps
from
kashmir
to
the
tibetan
heights
the
two
latter
passes
present
no
difficulties
the
zoji
la
is
a
thoroughly
severe
pass
the
worst
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
the
sasir
on
the
yarkand
caravan
route
the
track
cut
broken
and
worn
on
the
side
of
a
wall
of
rock
nearly
feet
in
abrupt
elevation
is
a
series
of
rough
narrow
zigzags
rarely
if
ever
wide
enough
for
laden
animals
to
pass
each
other
composed
of
broken
ledges
often
nearly
breast
high
and
shelving
surfaces
of
abraded
rock
up
which
animals
have
to
leap
and
scramble
as
best
they
may
trees
and
trailers
drooped
over
the
path
ferns
and
lilies
bloomed
in
moist
recesses
and
among
myriads
of
flowers
a
large
blue
and
cream
columbine
was
conspicuous
by
its
beauty
and
exquisite
odour
the
charm
of
the
detail
tempted
one
to
linger
at
every
turn
and
all
the
more
so
because
i
knew
that
i
should
see
nothing
more
of
the
grace
and
bounteousness
of
nature
till
my
projected
descent
into
kulu
in
the
late
autumn
the
gorge
on
whose
abrupt
side
the
path
hangs
the
zoji
la
pass
is
geographically
remarkable
as
being
the
lowest
depression
in
the
great
himalayan
range
for
miles
and
by
it
in
spite
of
infamous
bits
of
road
on
the
sind
and
suru
rivers
and
consequent
losses
of
goods
and
animals
all
the
traffic
of
kashmir
afghanistan
and
the
western
panjāb
finds
its
way
into
central
asia
it
was
too
early
in
the
season
however
for
more
than
a
few
enterprising
caravans
to
be
on
the
road
the
last
look
upon
kashmir
was
a
lingering
one
below
in
shadow
lay
the
baltal
a
lonely
flowery
meadow
noisy
with
the
dash
of
icy
torrents
tumbling
down
from
the
snowfields
and
glaciers
upborne
by
the
gigantic
mountain
range
into
which
we
had
penetrated
by
the
zoji
pass
the
valley
lying
in
shadow
at
their
base
was
a
dream
of
beauty
green
as
an
english
lawn
starred
with
white
lilies
and
dotted
with
clumps
of
trees
which
were
festooned
with
red
and
white
roses
clematis
and
white
jasmine
above
the
hardier
deciduous
trees
appeared
the
the
silver
fir
and
the
spruce
higher
yet
the
stately
grace
of
the
deodar
clothed
the
hillsides
and
above
the
forests
rose
the
snow
mountains
of
tilail
pink
in
the
sunrise
high
above
the
zoji
itself
feet
in
altitude
a
mass
of
grey
and
red
mountains
and
rose
in
the
dewy
atmosphere
in
peaks
walls
pinnacles
and
jagged
ridges
above
which
towered
yet
loftier
summits
bearing
into
the
heavenly
blue
sky
fields
of
unsullied
snow
alone
the
descent
on
the
tibetan
side
is
slight
and
gradual
the
character
of
the
scenery
undergoes
an
abrupt
change
there
are
no
more
trees
and
the
large
shrubs
which
for
a
time
take
their
place
degenerate
into
thorny
bushes
and
then
disappear
there
were
mountains
thinly
clothed
with
grass
here
and
there
mountains
of
bare
gravel
and
red
rock
grey
crags
stretches
of
green
turf
sunlit
peaks
with
their
snows
a
deep
ravine
eastwards
and
beyond
a
long
valley
filled
with
a
snowfield
fringed
with
pink
primulas
and
that
was
central
asia
we
halted
for
breakfast
iced
our
cold
tea
in
the
snow
gave
a
final
charge
to
the
afghan
who
swore
by
his
prophet
to
be
faithful
and
i
parted
from
my
kind
escorts
with
much
reluctance
and
started
on
my
tibetan
journey
with
but
a
slender
stock
of
hindustani
and
two
men
who
spoke
not
a
word
of
english
on
that
day
march
of
fourteen
miles
there
is
not
a
single
hut
the
snowfield
extended
for
five
miles
from
ten
to
seventy
feet
deep
much
crevassed
and
encumbered
with
avalanches
in
it
the
dras
truly
appeared
issuing
from
a
chasm
under
a
blue
arch
of
ice
and
snow
afterwards
to
rage
down
the
valley
to
be
forded
many
times
or
crossed
on
snow
bridges
after
walking
for
some
time
and
getting
a
bad
fall
down
an
avalanche
slope
i
mounted
gyalpo
and
the
clever
plucky
fellow
frolicked
over
the
snow
smelt
and
leapt
crevasses
which
were
too
wide
to
be
stepped
over
put
his
forelegs
together
and
slid
down
slopes
like
a
swiss
mule
and
though
carried
off
his
feet
in
a
ford
by
the
fierce
surges
of
the
dras
struggled
gamely
to
shore
steep
grassy
hills
and
peaks
with
gorges
cleft
by
the
thundering
dras
and
stretches
of
rolling
grass
succeeded
each
other
then
came
a
wide
valley
mostly
covered
with
stones
brought
down
by
torrents
a
few
plots
of
miserable
barley
grown
by
irrigation
and
among
them
two
buildings
of
round
stones
and
mud
about
six
feet
high
with
flat
mud
roofs
one
of
which
might
be
called
the
village
and
the
other
the
caravanserai
on
the
village
roof
were
stacks
of
twigs
and
of
the
dried
dung
of
animals
which
is
used
for
fuel
and
the
whole
female
population
adult
and
juvenile
engaged
in
picking
wool
the
people
of
this
village
of
matayan
are
kashmiris
as
i
had
an
hour
to
wait
for
my
tent
the
women
descended
and
sat
in
a
circle
round
me
with
a
concentrated
stare
they
asked
if
i
were
dumb
and
why
i
wore
no
earrings
or
necklace
their
own
persons
being
loaded
with
heavy
ornaments
they
brought
children
afflicted
with
and
asked
for
ointment
and
on
hearing
that
i
was
hurt
by
a
fall
seized
on
my
limbs
and
shampooed
them
energetically
but
not
undexterously
i
prefer
their
sociability
to
the
usual
chilling
aloofness
of
the
people
of
kashmir
the
serai
consisted
of
several
dark
and
dirty
cells
built
round
a
blazing
piece
of
sloping
dust
the
only
and
under
the
entrance
two
platforms
of
animated
earth
on
which
my
servants
cooked
and
slept
the
next
day
was
sunday
sacred
to
a
halt
but
there
was
no
fodder
for
the
animals
and
we
were
obliged
to
march
to
dras
following
where
possible
the
course
of
the
river
of
that
name
which
passes
among
and
mountains
except
in
places
where
it
suddenly
finds
itself
pent
between
walls
of
or
black
rock
not
ten
feet
apart
through
which
it
boils
and
rages
forming
gigantic
with
every
mile
the
surroundings
became
more
markedly
of
the
central
asian
type
all
day
long
a
white
scintillating
sun
blazes
out
of
a
deep
blue
rainless
cloudless
sky
the
air
is
exhilarating
the
traveller
is
conscious
of
energy
and
vitality
there
are
no
trees
and
deep
crimson
roses
along
torrent
beds
are
the
only
shrubs
but
for
a
brief
fortnight
in
june
which
chanced
to
occur
during
my
journey
the

and
the

of

drinking
in

which
perfects
all
too
soon
their
brief
but
passionate
existence
rippled
in
broad
waves
of
colour
with
an
almost
kaleidoscopic
effect
about
the
eleventh
march
from
srinagar
at
kargil
a
change
for
the
worse
occurs
and
the
remaining
marches
to
the
capital
of
ladakh
are
over
blazing
gravel
or
surfaces
of
denuded
rock
the
singular
with
its
mass
of
wavy
ovate
leaves
on
trailing
stems
and
its
fair
white
blossom
and
the
graceful
the
only
vegetation
crossing
a
raging
affluent
of
the
dras
by
a
bridge
which
swayed
and
shivered
the
top
of
a
steep
hill
offered
a
view
of
a
great
valley
with
branches
sloping
up
into
the
ravines
of
a
complexity
of
mountain
ranges
from
to
feet
in
altitude
with
glaciers
at
times
descending
as
low
as
feet
in
their
hollows
in
consequence
of
such
possibilities
of
irrigation
the
valley
is
green
with
irrigated
grass
and
barley
and
villages
with
flat
roofs
scattered
among
the
crops
or
perched
on
the
spurs
of
mountains
give
it
a
wild
cheerfulness
these
dras
villages
are
inhabited
by
hardy
dards
and
baltis
short
darker
and
far
less
handsome
than
the
kashmiris
but
unlike
them
they
showed
so
much
friendliness
as
well
as
interest
and
curiosity
that
i
remained
with
them
for
two
days
visiting
their
villages
and
seeing
the
they
had
to
show
me
chiefly
a
great
sikh
fort
a
bull
the
a
hybrid
the
interiors
of
their
houses
a
magnificent
view
from
a
hilltop
and
a
dard
dance
to
the
music
of
dard
reed
pipes
in
return
i
sketched
them
individually
and
collectively
as
far
as
time
allowed
presenting
them
with
the
results
truthful
and
ugly
i
bought
a
sheep
for
and
regaled
the
camp
upon
it
the
three
which
were
brought
for
my
inspection
being
ridden
by
boys
astride
the
evenings
in
the
dras
valley
were
exquisite
as
soon
as
the
sun
went
behind
the
higher
mountains
peak
above
peak
red
and
flamed
against
a
lemon
sky
the
strong
wind
moderated
into
a
pure
stiff
breeze
bringing
up
to
camp
the
thunder
of
the
dras
and
the
musical
tinkle
of
streams
sparkling
in
absolute
purity
there
was
no
more
need
for
boiling
and
filtering
icy
water
could
be
drunk
in
safety
from
every
crystal
torrent
leaving
behind
the
dras
villages
and
their
fertility
the
narrow
road
passes
through
a
flaming
valley
above
the
dras
walled
in
by
bare
riven
peaks
with
steep
declivities
of
stones
huge
boulders
decaying
avalanches
walls
and
spires
of
rock
some
vermilion
others
pink
a
few
intense
orange
some
black
and
many
with
a
vitrified
look
only
to
be
represented
by
purple
madder
huge
red
chasms
with
torrents
occasional
snowfields
intense
solar
heat
radiating
from
dry
and
verdureless
rock
a
ravine
so
steep
and
narrow
that
for
miles
together
there
is
not
space
to
pitch
a
tent
the
deafening
roar
of
a
river
gathering
volume
and
fury
as
it
goes
rare
openings
where
willows
are
planted
with
lucerne
in
their
irrigated
shade
among
which
the
traveller
camps
at
night
and
over
all
a
sky
of
pure
intense
blue
purpling
into
starry
night
were
the
features
of
the
next
three
marches
noteworthy
chiefly
for
the
exchange
of
the
thundering
dras
for
the
thundering
suru
and
for
some
bad
bridges
and
infamous
bits
of
road
before
reaching
kargil
where
the
mountains
swing
apart
giving
space
to
several
villages
miles
of
alluvium
are
under
irrigation
there
poplars
willows
and
apricots
abound
and
on
some
damp
sward
under
their
shade
at
a
great
height
i
halted
for
two
days
to
enjoy
the
magnificence
of
the
scenery
and
the
refreshment
of
the
greenery
these
kargil
villages
are
the
capital
of
the
small
state
of
purik
under
the
governorship
of
baltistan
or
little
tibet
and
are
chiefly
inhabited
by
ladakhis
who
have
become
converts
to
islam
racial
characteristics
dress
and
manners
are
everywhere
effaced
or
toned
down
by
mohammedanism
and
the
chilling
aloofness
and
haughty
bearing
of
islam
were
very
pronounced
among
these
converts
the
daily
routine
of
the
journey
was
as
follows
by
six
i
sent
on
a
coolie
carrying
the
small
tent
and
lunch
basket
to
await
me
before
seven
i
started
myself
with
usman
shah
in
front
of
me
leaving
the
servants
to
follow
with
the
caravan
on
reaching
the
shelter
tent
i
halted
for
two
hours
or
till
the
caravan
had
got
a
good
start
after
passing
me
at
the
end
of
the
march
i
usually
found
the
tent
pitched
on
irrigated
ground
near
a
hamlet
the
headman
of
which
provided
milk
fuel
fodder
and
other
necessaries
at
fixed
prices
tea
was
speedily
prepared
and
dinner
consisting
of
roast
meat
and
boiled
rice
was
ready
two
hours
later
after
dinner
i
usually
conversed
with
the
headman
on
local
interests
and
was
in
bed
soon
after
eight
the
servants
and
muleteers
fed
and
talked
till
nine
when
the
sound
of
their
indicated
that
they
were
going
to
sleep
like
most
orientals
with
their
heads
closely
covered
with
their
wadded
quilts
before
starting
each
morning
the
account
was
made
out
and
i
paid
the
headman
personally
the
vagaries
of
the
afghan
soldier
when
they
were
not
a
cause
of
annoyance
were
a
constant
amusement
though
his
ceaseless
changes
of
finery
and
the
daily
growth
of
his
baggage
awakened
grave
suspicions
the
swashbuckler
marched
four
miles
an
hour
in
front
of
me
with
a
swinging
military
stride
a
large
scimitar
in
a
heavily
ornamented
scabbard
over
his
shoulder
tanned
socks
and
sandals
black
or
white
leggings
wound
round
from
ankle
to
knee
with
broad
bands
of
orange
or
scarlet
serge
white
cambric
knickerbockers
a
white
cambric
shirt
with
a
short
white
muslin
frock
with
hanging
sleeves
and
a
leather
girdle
over
it
a
cap
with
a
wound
round
it
with
one
end
hanging
over
his
back
earrings
a
necklace
bracelets
and
a
profusion
of
rings
were
his
ordinary
costume
and
in
his
girdle
he
wore
a
dirk
and
a
revolver
and
suspended
from
it
a
long
tobacco
pouch
made
of
the
furry
skin
of
some
animal
a
large
leather
purse
and
etceteras
as
the
days
went
on
he
blossomed
into
blue
and
white
muslin
with
a
scarlet
sash
wore
a
gold
embroidered
peak
and
a
huge
white
muslin
turban
with
much
change
of
ornaments
and
appeared
frequently
with
a
great
bunch
of
poppies
or
a
cluster
of
crimson
roses
surmounting
all
his
headgear
was
colossal
it
and
the
head
together
must
have
been
fully
a
third
of
his
total
height
he
was
a
most
fantastic
object
and
very
observant
and
skilful
in
his
attentions
to
me
but
if
i
had
known
what
i
afterwards
knew
i
should
have
hesitated
about
taking
these
long
lonely
marches
with
him
for
my
sole
attendant
between
hassan
khan
and
this
afghan
violent
hatred
and
jealousy
existed
i
have
mentioned
roads
and
my
road
as
the
great
caravan
route
from
western
india
into
central
asia
this
is
a
fitting
time
for
an
explanation
the
traveller
who
aspires
to
reach
the
highlands
of
tibet
from
kashmir
can
not
be
borne
along
in
a
carriage
or
for
much
of
the
way
he
is
limited
to
a
foot
pace
and
if
he
has
regard
to
his
horse
he
walks
down
all
rugged
and
steep
descents
which
are
many
and
dismounts
at
most
bridges
by
must
be
understood
worn
by
traffic
alone
across
the
gravelly
valleys
but
elsewhere
constructed
with
great
toil
and
expense
as
nature
compels
the
to
follow
her
lead
and
carry
his
track
along
the
narrow
valleys
ravines
gorges
and
chasms
which
she
has
marked
out
for
him
for
miles
at
a
time
this
road
has
been
blasted
out
of
precipices
from
feet
to
feet
in
depth
and
is
merely
a
ledge
above
a
raging
torrent
the
worst
parts
chiefly
those
round
rocky
projections
being
poles
are
lodged
horizontally
among
the
crevices
of
the
cliff
and
the
roadway
of
slabs
planks
and
brushwood
or
branches

laid
loosely
upon

this
track
is
always
amply
wide
enough
for
a
loaded
beast
but
in
many
places
when
two
caravans
meet
the
animals
of
one
must
give
way
and
scramble
up
the
where
foothold
is
often
perilous
and
always
difficult
in
passing
a
caravan
near
kargil
my
servant
horse
was
pushed
over
the
precipice
by
a
loaded
mule
and
drowned
in
the
suru
and
at
another
time
my
afghan
caused
the
loss
of
a
baggage
mule
of
a
leh
caravan
by
driving
it
off
the
track
to
scatter
a
caravan
so
as
to
allow
me
to
pass
in
solitary
dignity
he
regarded
as
one
of
his
functions
and
on
one
occasion
on
a
very
dangerous
part
of
the
road
as
he
was
driving
heavily
laden
mules
up
the
steep
rocks
above
to
their
imminent
peril
and
the
distraction
of
their
drivers
i
was
obliged
to
strike
up
his
sword
with
my
alpenstock
to
emphasise
my
abhorrence
of
his
violence
the
bridges
are
unrailed
and
many
of
them
are
made
by
placing
two
or
more
logs
across
the
stream
laying
twigs
across
and
covering
these
with
sods
but
often
so
scantily
that
the
wild
rush
of
the
water
is
seen
below
primitive
as
these
bridges
are
they
involve
great
expense
and
difficulty
in
the
bringing
of
long
poplar
logs
for
great
distances
along
narrow
mountain
tracks
by
coolie
labour
fifty
men
being
required
for
the
average
log
the
ladakhi
roads
are
admirable
as
compared
with
those
of
kashmir
and
are
being
constantly
improved
under
the
supervision
of
joint
commissioner
in
leh
up
to
kargil
the
scenery
though
growing
more
tibetan
with
every
march
had
exhibited
at
intervals
some
traces
of
natural
verdure
but
beyond
after
leaving
the
suru
there
is
not
a
green
thing
and
on
the
next
march
the
road
crosses
a
lofty
sandy
plateau
on
which
the
heat
was
terrible
blazing
gravel
and
a
blazing
heaven
then
fiery
cliffs
and
scorched
hillsides
then
a
deep
ravine
and
the
large
village
of
paskim
dominated
by
a
rock
and
some
planted
and
irrigated
acres
then
a
narrow
ravine
and
magnificent
scenery
flaming
with
colour
which
opens
out
after
some
miles
on
a
burning
chaos
of
rocks
and
sand
and
on
some
remarkable
dwellings
on
a
steep
slope
with
religious
buildings
singularly
painted
this
is
shergol
the
first
village
of
buddhists
and
there
i
was
the
tibetans
chapter
ii
shergol
and
leh
the
chaos
of
rocks
and
sand
walled
in
by
vermilion
and
orange
mountains
on
which
the
village
of
shergol
stands
offered
no
facilities
for
camping
but
somehow
the
men
managed
to
pitch
my
tent
on
a
steep
slope
where
i
had
to
place
my
trestle
bed
astride
an
irrigation
channel
down
which
the
water
bubbled
noisily
on
its
way
to
keep
alive
some
miserable
patches
of
barley
at
shergol
and
elsewhere
fodder
is
so
scarce
that
the
grain
is
not
cut
but
pulled
up
by
the
roots
the
intensely
human
interest
of
the
journey
began
at
that
point
not
greater
is
the
contrast
between
the
grassy
slopes
and
mountains
of
kashmir
and
the
flaming
aridity
of
lesser
tibet
than
between
the
tall
dark
handsome
natives
of
the
one
with
their
statuesque
and
shrinking
women
and
the
ugly
short
squat
people
of
the
other
the
kashmiris
are
false
cringing
and
suspicious
the
tibetans
truthful
independent
and
friendly
one
of
the
pleasantest
of
peoples
i
to
them
at
once
at
shergol
and
terribly
faulty
though
their
morals
are
in
some
respects
i
found
no
reason
to
change
my
good
opinion
of
them
in
the
succeeding
four
months
the
headman
or
came
to
see
me
introduced
me
to
the
objects
of
interest
which
are
a
or
monastery
built
into
the
rock
with
a
brightly
coloured
front
and
three
or
painted
blue
red
and
yellow
and
daubed
with
coarse
arabesques
and
representations
of
deities
one
having
a
striking
resemblance
to
gladstone
the
houses
are
of
mud
with
flat
roofs
but
being
summer
many
of
them
were
roofless
the
poplar
rods
which
support
the
mud
having
been
used
for
fuel
conical
stacks
of
the
dried
excreta
of
animals
the
chief
fuel
of
the
country
adorned
the
roofs
but
the
general
aspect
was
ruinous
and
poor
the
people
all
invited
me
into
their
dark
and
dirty
rooms
inhabited
also
by
goats
offered
tea
and
cheese
and
felt
my
clothes
they
looked
the
wildest
of
savages
but
they
are
not
no
house
was
so
poor
as
not
to
have
its
altar
its
shelf
of
wooden
gods
and

pervades
tibet

gives
it
a

in
leh
were
living
redslob
and
karl
marx
with
their
wives
marx
was
at
his
gate
to
welcome
me
to
these
two
men
especially
the
former
i
owe
a
debt
of
gratitude
which
in
no
shape
not
even
by
the
hearty
acknowledgment
of
it
can
ever
be
repaid
for
they
died
within
a
few
days
of
each
other
of
an
epidemic
last
year
marx
and
a
son
being
buried
in
one
grave
for
years
redslob
a
man
of
noble
physique
and
intellect
a
scholar
and
linguist
an
expert
botanist
and
an
admirable
artist
devoted
himself
to
the
welfare
of
the
tibetans
and
though
his
great
aim
was
to
christianize
them
he
gained
their
confidence
so
thoroughly
by
his
virtues
kindness
profound
tibetan
scholarship
and
manliness
that
he
was
loved
and
welcomed
everywhere
and
is
now
mourned
for
as
the
best
and
truest
friend
the
people
ever
had
i
had
scarcely
finished
breakfast
when
he
called
a
man
of
great
height
and
strong
voice
with
a
cheery
manner
a
face
beaming
with
kindness
and
speaking
excellent
english
leh
was
the
goal
of
my
journey
but
redslob
came
with
a
proposal
to
escort
me
over
the
great
passes
to
the
northward
for
a
three
weeks
journey
to
nubra
a
district
formed
of
the
combined
valleys
of
the
shayok
and
nubra
rivers
tributaries
of
the
indus
and
abounding
in
interest
of
course
i
at
once
accepted
an
offer
so
full
of
advantages
and
the
performance
was
better
even
than
the
promise
two
days
were
occupied
in
making
preparations
but
afterwards
i
spent
a
fortnight
in
my
tent
at
leh
a
city
by
no
means
to
be
passed
over
without
remark
for
though
it
and
the
region
of
which
it
is
the
capital
are
very
remote
from
the
thoughts
of
most
readers
it
is
one
of
the
centres
of
central
asian
commerce
there
all
traders
from
india
kashmir
and
afghanistan
must
halt
for
animals
and
supplies
on
their
way
to
yarkand
and
khotan
and
there
also
merchants
from
the
mysterious
city
of
lhassa
do
a
great
business
in
brick
tea
and
in
lhassa
wares
chiefly
ecclesiastical
illustration
leh
the
situation
of
leh
is
a
grand
one
the
great
kailas
range
with
its
glaciers
and
snowfields
rising
just
behind
it
to
the
north
its
passes
alone
reaching
an
altitude
of
nearly
feet
while
to
the
south
across
a
gravelly
descent
and
the
indus
valley
rise
great
red
ranges
dominated
by
exceeding
feet
in
altitude
the
centre
of
leh
is
a
wide
bazaar
where
much
polo
is
played
in
the
afternoons
and
above
this
the
irregular
houses
of
the
town
cluster
round
the
palace
and
a
gigantic
alongside
it
the
rugged
crest
of
the
rock
on
a
spur
of
which
the
palace
stands
is
crowned
by
the
fantastic
buildings
of
an
ancient
beyond
the
crops
and
plantations
which
surround
the
town
lies
a
flaming
desert
of
gravel
or
rock
the
architectural
features
of
leh
except
of
the
palace
are
mean
a
new
mosque
glaring
with
vulgar
colour
a
treasury
and
court
of
justice
the
wazir
bungalow
a
moslem
cemetery
and
buddhist
cremation
grounds
in
which
each
family
has
its
separate
burning
place
are
all
that
is
noteworthy
the
narrow
alleys
which
would
be
abominably
dirty
if
dirt
were
possible
in
a
climate
of
such
intense
dryness
house
a
very
mixed
population
in
which
the
moslem
element
is
always
increasing
partly
owing
to
the
renewal
of
that
proselytising
energy
which
is
making
itself
felt
throughout
asia
and
partly
to
the
marriages
of
moslem
traders
with
ladaki
women
who
embrace
the
faith
of
their
husbands
and
bring
up
their
families
in
the
same
on
my
arrival
few
of
the
shops
in
the
great
or
bazaar
were
open
and
there
was
no
business
but
a
few
weeks
later
the
little
desert
capital
nearly
doubled
its
population
and
during
august
the
din
and
stir
of
trade
and
amusements
ceased
not
by
day
or
night
and
the
shifting
scenes
were
as
gay
in
colouring
and
as
full
of
variety
as
could
be
desired
great
caravans
for
khotan
yarkand
and
even
chinese
tibet
arrived
daily
from
kashmir
the
panjāb
and
afghanistan
and
stacked
their
bales
of
goods
in
the
the
lhassa
traders
opened
shops
in
which
the
specialties
were
brick
tea
and
instruments
of
worship
merchants
from
amritsar
cabul
bokhara
and
yarkand
stately
in
costume
and
gait
thronged
the
bazaar
and
opened
bales
of
costly
goods
in
tantalising
fashion
mules
asses
horses
and
kicked
squealed
and
bellowed
the
dissonance
of
bargaining
tongues
rose
high
there
were
mendicant
monks
indian
fakirs
moslem
dervishes
mecca
pilgrims
itinerant
musicians
and
buddhist
ballad
howlers
women
with
creels
on
their
backs
brought
in
lucerne
ladakis
baltis
and
lahulis
tended
the
beasts
and
the
wazir
and
gay
moved
about
among
the
throngs
in
the
midst
of
this
picturesque
confusion
the
short
lhassa
traders
who
face
the
blazing
sun
in
heavy
winter
clothing
exchange
their
expensive
tea
for
nubra
and
baltistan
dried
apricots
kashmir
saffron
and
rich
stuffs
from
india
and
merchants
from
yarkand
on
big
turkestan
horses
offer
hemp
which
is
smoked
as
opium
and
russian
trifles
and
dress
goods
under
cloudless
skies
with
the
huge
kailas
range
as
a
background
this
great
rendezvous
of
central
asian
traffic
has
a
great
fascination
even
though
moral
shadows
of
the
darkest
kind
abound
on
the
second
morning
while
i
was
taking
the
sketch
of
usman
shah
which
appears
as
the
frontispiece
he
was
recognised
both
by
the
joint
commissioner
and
the
chief
of
police
as
a
mutineer
and
murderer
and
was
marched
out
of
leh
i
was
asked
to
look
over
my
baggage
but
did
not
i
had
trusted
him
he
had
been
faithful
in
his
way
and
later
i
found
that
nothing
was
missing
he
was
a
brutal
ruffian
one
of
a
band
of
irregulars
sent
by
the
maharajah
of
kashmir
to
garrison
the
fort
at
leh
from
it
they
used
to
descend
on
the
town
plunder
the
bazaar
insult
the
women
take
all
they
wanted
without
payment
and
when
one
of
their
number
was
being
tried
for
some
offence
they
dragged
the
judge
out
of
court
and
beat
him
after
holding
leh
in
terror
for
some
time
the
british
commissioner
obtained
their
removal
it
was
however
at
the
fort
at
the
indus
bridge
as
related
before
that
the
crime
of
murder
was
committed
still
there
was
something
almost
grand
in
the
defiant
attitude
of
the
fantastic
swashbuckler
as
standing
outside
the
bungalow
he
faced
the
british
commissioner
to
him
the
embodiment
of
all
earthly
power
and
the
chief
of
police
and
defied
them
not
an
inch
would
he
stir
till
the
wazir
gave
him
a
coolie
to
carry
his
baggage
he
had
been
acquitted
of
the
murder
he
said
though
i
killed
the
man
it
was
according
to
the
custom
of
my
country
he
gave
me
an
insult
which
could
only
be
wiped
out
in
blood
the
guard
dared
not
touch
him
and
he
went
to
the
wazir
demanded
a
coolie
and
got
one
our
party
left
leh
early
on
a
glorious
morning
travelling
light
redslob
a
very
learned
lhassa
monk
named
gergan
servant
my
three
and
four
baggage
horses
with
two
drivers
engaged
for
the
journey
the
great
kailas
range
was
to
be
crossed
and
the
first
march
up
long
barren
stony
valleys
without
interest
took
us
to
a
piece
of
level
ground
with
a
small
refuge
on
which
there
was
barely
room
for
two
tents
at
the
altitude
of
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
for
two
hours
before
we
reached
it
the
men
and
animals
showed
great
distress
gyalpo
stopped
every
few
yards
gasping
with
blood
trickling
from
his
nostrils
and
turned
his
head
so
as
to
look
at
me
with
the
question
in
his
eyes
what
does
this
mean
hassan
khan
was
reeling
from
vertigo
but
would
not
give
in
the
a
creature
without
pluck
was
carried
in
a
blanket
slung
on
my
tent
poles
and
even
the
tibetans
suffered
i
felt
no
inconvenience
but
as
i
unsaddled
gyalpo
i
was
glad
that
there
was
no
more
work
to
do
this
called
by
the
natives
or
is
supposed
by
them
to
be
the
result
of
the
odour
or
pollen
of
certain
plants
which
grow
on
the
passes
horses
and
mules
are
unable
to
carry
their
loads
and
men
suffer
from
vertigo
vomiting
violent
headache
and
bleeding
from
the
nose
mouth
and
ears
as
well
as
prostration
of
strength
sometimes
complete
and
occasionally
ending
fatally
after
a
bitterly
cold
night
i
was
awakened
at
dawn
by
novel
sounds
gruntings
and
low
resonant
bellowing
round
my
tent
and
the
grey
light
revealed
several
the
the
tibetan
ox
the
pride
of
the
tibetan
highlands
this
magnificent
animal
though
not
exceeding
an
english
shorthorn
cow
in
height
looks
gigantic
with
his
thick
curved
horns
his
wild
eyes
glaring
from
under
a
mass
of
curls
his
long
thick
hair
hanging
to
his
fetlocks
and
his
huge
bushy
tail
he
is
usually
black
or
tawny
but
the
tail
is
often
white
and
is
the
length
of
his
long
hair
the
nose
is
fine
and
has
a
look
of
breeding
as
well
as
power
he
only
flourishes
at
altitudes
exceeding
feet
even
after
generations
of
he
is
very
wild
and
can
only
be
managed
by
being
led
with
a
rope
attached
to
a
ring
in
the
nostrils
he
disdains
the
plough
but
condescends
to
carry
burdens
and
numbers
of
the
ladak
and
nubra
people
get
their
living
by
carrying
goods
for
the
traders
on
his
broad
back
over
the
great
passes
his
legs
are
very
short
and
he
has
a
sensible
way
of
measuring
distance
with
his
eyes
and
planting
his
feet
which
enables
him
to
carry
loads
where
it
might
be
supposed
that
only
a
goat
could
climb
he
picks
up
a
living
anyhow
in
that
respect
resembling
the
camel
he
has
an
uncertain
temper
and
is
not
favourably
disposed
towards
his
rider
indeed
my
experience
was
that
just
as
one
was
about
to
mount
him
he
usually
made
a
lunge
at
one
with
his
horns
some
of
my
steeds
shied
plunged
kicked
executed
fantastic
movements
on
the
ledges
of
precipices
knocked
down
their
leaders
bellowed
defiance
and
rushed
madly
down
mountain
sides
leaping
from
boulder
to
boulder
till
they
landed
me
among
their
fellows
the
rush
of
a
herd
of
bellowing
at
a
wild
gallop
waving
their
huge
tails
is
a
grand
sight
my
first
was
fairly
quiet
and
looked
a
noble
steed
with
my
mexican
saddle
and
gay
blanket
among
rather
than
upon
his
thick
black
locks
his
back
seemed
as
broad
as
that
of
an
elephant
and
with
his
slow
sure
resolute
step
he
was
like
a
mountain
in
motion
we
took
five
hours
for
the
ascent
of
the
digar
pass
our
loads
and
some
of
us
on
some
walking
and
those
who
suffered
most
from
the
and
could
not
sit
on
were
carried
a
number
of
tibetans
went
up
with
us
it
was
a
new
thing
for
a
european
lady
to
travel
in
nubra
and
they
took
a
friendly
interest
in
my
getting
through
all
right
the
dreary
stretches
of
the
ascent
though
at
first
white
with
of
which
the
people
make
their
tinder
are
surmounted
for
the
most
part
by
steep
short
zigzags
of
broken
stone
the
heavens
were
dark
with
the
wind
was
high
and
the
cold
severe
and
gasping
horses
and
men
prostrate
on
their
faces
unable
to
move
suggested
a
considerable
amount
of
suffering
but
all
safely
reached
the
summit
feet
where
in
a
snowstorm
the
guides
huzzaed
praised
their
gods
and
tucked
rag
streamers
into
a
cairn
the
loads
were
replaced
on
the
horses
and
over
wastes
of
ice
across
snowfields
margined
by
broad
splashes
of
primulas
down
desert
valleys
and
along
irrigated
hillsides
we
descended
feet
to
the
village
of
digar
in
nubra
where
under
a
cloudless
sky
the
mercury
stood
at
illustration
a
upper
and
lower
nubra
consist
of
the
valleys
of
the
nubra
and
shayok
rivers
these
are
deep
fierce
variable
streams
which
have
buried
the
lower
levels
under
great
stretches
of
shingle
patched
with
jungles
of
and
tamarisk
affording
cover
for
innumerable
wolves
great
lateral
torrents
descend
to
these
rivers
and
on
alluvial
ridges
formed
at
the
junctions
are
the
villages
with
their
pleasant
surroundings
of
barley
lucerne
wheat
with
poplar
and
fruit
trees
and
their
picturesque
crowning
spurs
of
rock
above
them
the
first
view
of
nubra
is
not
beautiful
yellow
absolutely
barren
mountains
cleft
by
yellow
gorges
and
apparently
formed
of
yellow
gravel
the
huge
rifts
in
their
sides
alone
showing
their
substructure
of
rock
look
as
if
they
had
never
been
finished
or
had
been
finished
so
long
that
they
had
returned
to
chaos
these
hem
in
a
valley
of
grey
sand
and
shingle
threaded
by
a
greyish
stream
from
the
second
view
point
mountains
are
seen
descending
on
a
pleasanter
part
of
the
shayok
valley
in
grey
yellow
or
vermilion
masses
of
naked
rock
and
feet
in
height
above
which
rise
peaks
sending
out
fantastic
spurs
and
buttresses
while
the
colossal
walls
of
rock
are
cleft
by
rifts
as
colossal
the
central
ridge
between
the
nubra
and
upper
shayok
valleys
is
feet
in
altitude
and
on
this
are
superimposed
five
peaks
of
rock
ascertained
by
survey
to
be
from
to
feet
in
height
while
at
one
point
the
eye
takes
in
a
nearly
vertical
height
of
feet
from
the
level
of
the
shayok
river
the
shayok
and
nubra
valleys
are
only
five
and
four
miles
in
width
respectively
at
their
widest
parts
the
early
winter
traffic
chiefly
follows
along
river
beds
then
nearly
dry
while
summer
caravans
have
to
labour
along
difficult
tracks
at
great
heights
where
mud
and
snow
avalanches
are
common
to
climb
dangerous
rock
ladders
and
to
cross
glaciers
and
the
risky
fords
of
the
shayok
nubra
is
similar
in
character
to
ladak
but
it
is
hotter
and
more
fertile
the
mountains
are
loftier
the
are
more
numerous
and
the
people
are
simpler
more
religious
and
more
purely
tibetan
redslob
loved
nubra
and
as
love
begets
love
he
received
a
hearty
welcome
at
digar
and
everywhere
else
the
descent
to
the
shayok
river
gave
us
a
most
severe
day
of
twelve
hours
the
river
had
covered
the
usual
track
and
we
had
to
take
to
torrent
beds
and
precipice
ledges
i
on
one
and
my
tent
on
another
in
years
of
travel
i
have
never
seen
such
difficulties
eventually
at
dusk
redslob
gergan
the
servants
and
i
descended
on
a
broad
shingle
bed
by
the
rushing
shayok
but
it
was
not
till
dawn
on
the
following
day
that
by
means
of
our
two
and
the
muleteers
our
baggage
and
food
arrived
the
baggage
horses
being
brought
down
unloaded
with
men
holding
the
head
and
tail
of
each
our
saddle
horses
which
we
led
with
us
were
much
cut
by
falls
gyalpo
fell
fully
twenty
feet
and
got
his
side
laid
open
the
baggage
horses
according
to
their
owners
had
all
gone
over
one
precipice
which
delayed
them
five
hours
below
us
lay
two
leaky
scows
and
eight
men
from
sati
on
the
other
side
of
the
shayok
are
pledged
to
the
government
to
ferry
travellers
but
no
amount
of
shouting
and
yelling
or
burning
of
brushwood
or
even
firing
brought
them
to
the
rescue
though
their
pleasant
lights
were
only
a
mile
off
snow
fell
the
wind
was
strong
and
keen
and
our
were
only
kept
down
by
heavy
stones
blankets
in
abundance
were
laid
down
yet
failed
to
soften
the
stones
on
which
i
slept
that
night
we
had
tea
and
rice
but
our
men
whose
baggage
was
astray
on
the
mountains
were
without
food
for
hours
positively
refusing
to
eat
our
food
or
cook
fresh
rice
in
our
cooking
pots
to
such
an
extent
has
hindu
infected
moslems
the
disasters
of
that
day
march
besides
various
breakages
were
two
servants
helpless
from
and
bruises
a
ladaki
who
had
rolled
over
a
precipice
with
a
broken
arm
and
gergan
bleeding
from
an
ugly
scalp
wound
also
from
a
fall
by
eight
the
next
morning
the
sun
was
high
and
brilliant
the
snows
of
the
ravines
under
its
fierce
heat
were
melting
fast
and
the
river
roaring
hoarsely
was
a
mad
rush
of
grey
rapids
and
grey
foam
but
three
weeks
later
in
the
season
lower
down
its
many
branches
are
only
two
feet
deep
this
shayok
which
can
not
in
any
way
be
circumvented
is
the
great
obstacle
on
this
yarkand
trade
route
travellers
and
their
goods
make
the
perilous
passage
in
the
scow
but
their
animals
swim
and
are
often
paralysed
by
the
water
and
drowned
my
moslem
servants
and
trembling
committed
themselves
to
allah
on
the
river
bank
and
the
buddhists
worshipped
their
sleeve
idols
the
or
headman
of
sati
a
splendid
fellow
who
accompanied
us
through
nubra
and
eight
satellites
were
the
charons
of
that
styx
they
poled
and
paddled
with
yells
of
excitement
the
rapids
seized
the
scow
and
carried
her
broadside
down
into
hissing
and
raging
surges
then
there
was
a
plash
a
leap
of
maddened
water
half
filling
the
boat
a
struggle
a
whirl
violent
efforts
and
a
united
yell
and
far
down
the
torrent
we
were
in
smooth
water
on
the
opposite
shore
the
ferrymen
recrossed
pulled
our
saddle
horses
by
ropes
into
the
river
the
held
them
again
the
scow
and
her
frantic
crew
poling
paddling
and
yelling
were
hurried
broadside
down
and
as
they
swept
past
there
were
glimpses
above
and
among
the
surges
of
the
heads
and
drifting
forelocks
of
two
grey
horses
swimming
desperately
for
their
lives
a
splendid
sight
they
landed
safely
but
of
the
baggage
animals
one
was
sucked
under
the
boat
and
drowned
and
as
the
others
refused
to
face
the
rapids
we
had
to
obtain
other
transport
a
few
days
later
the
scow
which
was
brought
up
in
pieces
from
kashmir
on
coolies
backs
at
a
cost
of
four
hundred
rupees
was
dashed
to
pieces
a
halt
for
sunday
in
an
apricot
grove
in
the
pleasant
village
of
sati
refreshed
us
all
for
the
long
marches
which
followed
by
which
we
crossed
the
sasir
pass
full
of
difficulties
from
snow
and
glaciers
which
extend
for
many
miles
to
the
dipsang
plain
the
bleakest
and
dreariest
of
central
asian
wastes
from
which
the
gentle
ascent
of
the
karakorum
pass
rises
and
returned
varying
our
route
slightly
to
the
pleasant
villages
of
the
nubra
valley
everywhere
redslob
tibetan
scholarship
his
courtesy
his
kindness
and
adaptability
and
his
medical
skill
ensured
us
a
welcome
the
heartiness
of
which
i
can
not
describe
the
headmen
and
elders
of
the
villages
came
to
meet
us
when
we
arrived
and
escorted
us
when
we
left
the
monasteries
and
houses
with
the
best
they
contained
were
thrown
open
to
us
the
men
sat
round
our
at
night
telling
stories
and
local
gossip
and
asking
questions
everything
being
translated
to
me
by
my
kind
guide
and
so
we
actually
lived
the
tibetans
chapter
iii
nubra
in
order
to
visit
lower
nubra
and
return
to
leh
we
were
obliged
to
cross
the
great
fords
of
the
shayok
at
the
most
dangerous
season
of
the
year
this
transit
had
been
the
bugbear
of
the
journey
ever
since
news
reached
us
of
the
destruction
of
the
sati
scow
redslob
questioned
every
man
we
met
on
the
subject
solemn
and
noisy
conclaves
were
held
upon
it
round
the
it
was
said
that
the
woman
and
her
horse
could
never
get
across
and
for
days
before
we
reached
the
stream
the
or
government
made
nightly
reports
to
the
village
headmen
of
the
state
of
the
waters
which
were
steadily
rising
the
final
verdict
being
that
they
were
only
just
practicable
for
strong
horses
to
delay
till
the
waters
fell
was
impossible
redslob
had
engagements
in
leh
and
i
was
already
somewhat
late
for
the
passage
of
the
lofty
passes
between
tibet
and
british
india
before
the
winter
so
we
decided
on
crossing
with
every
precaution
which
experience
could
suggest
at
lagshung
the
evening
before
the
tibetans
made
prayers
and
offerings
for
a
day
cloudy
enough
to
keep
the
water
down
but
in
the
morning
from
a
cloudless
sky
a
scintillating
sun
blazed
down
like
a
magnesium
light
and
every
glacier
and
snowfield
sent
its
tribute
torrent
to
the
shayok
in
crossing
a
stretch
of
white
sand
the
solar
heat
was
so
fierce
that
our
european
skins
were
blistered
through
our
clothing
we
halted
at
lagshung
at
the
house
of
a
friendly
who
pressed
upon
me
the
loan
of
a
big
yarkand
horse
for
the
ford
a
kindness
which
nearly
proved
fatal
and
then
by
shingle
paths
through
lacerating
thickets
of
the
horrid
we
reached
a
on
the
shingly
bank
of
the
river
where
the
tibetans
renewed
their
prayers
and
offerings
and
the
final
orders
for
the
crossing
were
issued
we
had
twelve
horses
carrying
only
quarter
loads
each
all
led
the
servants
were
mounted
with
poles
sounded
the
river
ahead
one
led
redslob
horse
the
rider
being
in
front
of
mine
with
a
long
rope
and
two
more
led
mine
while
the
of
three
villages
and
the
steadied
my
horse
against
the
stream
the
only
wore
girdles
and
with
and
pigtails
streaming
from
their
heads
and
their
uncouth
yells
and
wild
gesticulations
they
looked
true
illustration
a
lama
the
shayok
presented
an
expanse
of
eight
branches
and
a
main
stream
divided
by
shallows
and
shingle
banks
the
whole
a
mile
and
a
half
in
width
on
the
brink
the
made
us
all
drink
good
draughts
of
the
turbid
river
water
prevent
giddiness
they
said
and
they
added
that
i
must
not
think
them
rude
if
they
dashed
water
at
my
face
frequently
with
the
same
object
hassan
khan
and
mando
who
was
livid
with
fright
wore
goggles
that
they
might
not
see
the
rapids
in
the
second
branch
the
water
reached
the
horses
bodies
and
my
animal
tottered
and
swerved
there
were
bursts
of
wild
laughter
not
merriment
but
excitement
accompanied
by
yells
as
the
streams
grew
fiercer
a
loud
chorus
of
sharbaz
done
was
yelled
to
encourage
the
horses
and
the
boom
and
hiss
of
the
shayok
made
a
wild
accompaniment
gyalpo
for
whose
legs
of
steel
i
longed
frolicked
as
usual
making
mirthful
lunges
at
his
leader
when
the
pair
halted
hassan
khan
in
the
deepest
branch
shakily
said
to
me
not
afraid
mem
sahib
during
the
hour
spent
in
crossing
the
eight
branches
i
thought
that
the
risk
had
been
exaggerated
and
that
giddiness
was
the
chief
peril
but
when
we
halted
cold
and
dripping
on
the
shingle
bank
of
the
main
stream
i
changed
my
mind
a
deep
fierce
swirling
rapid
with
a
calmer
depth
below
its
farther
bank
and
fully
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
was
yet
to
be
crossed
the
business
was
serious
all
the
went
up
and
down
sounding
long
before
they
found
a
possible
passage
all
loads
were
raised
higher
the
men
roped
their
soaked
clothing
on
their
shoulders
water
was
dashed
repeatedly
at
our
faces
girths
were
tightened
and
then
with
shouts
and
yells
the
whole
caravan
plunged
into
deep
water
strong
and
almost
half
an
hour
was
spent
in
that
devious
ford
without
any
apparent
progress
for
in
the
dizzy
swirl
the
horses
simply
seemed
treading
the
water
backwards
louder
grew
the
yells
as
the
torrent
raged
more
hoarsely
the
chorus
of
grew
frantic
the
water
was
up
to
the
men
armpits
and
the
seat
of
my
saddle
my
horse
tottered
and
swerved
several
times
the
nearing
shore
presented
an
abrupt
bank
underscooped
by
the
stream
there
was
a
deeper
plunge
an
encouraging
shout
and
redslob
strong
horse
leapt
the
bank
the
encouraged
mine
he
made
a
desperate
effort
but
fell
short
and
rolled
over
backwards
into
the
shayok
with
his
rider
under
him
a
struggle
a
moment
of
suffocation
and
i
was
extricated
by
strong
arms
to
be
knocked
down
again
by
the
rush
of
the
water
to
be
again
dragged
up
and
hauled
and
hoisted
up
the
crumbling
bank
i
escaped
with
a
broken
rib
and
some
severe
bruises
but
the
horse
was
drowned
redslob
who
had
thought
that
my
life
could
not
be
saved
and
the
tibetans
were
so
distressed
by
the
accident
that
i
made
very
light
of
it
and
only
took
one
day
of
rest
the
following
morning
some
men
and
animals
were
carried
away
and
afterwards
the
ford
was
impassable
for
a
fortnight
such
risks
are
among
the
amenities
of
the
great
trade
route
from
india
into
central
asia
illustration
three
gopas
the
lower
nubra
valley
is
wilder
and
narrower

more
luxuriant
its

thickets
more

its
villages
are
always
close

the

of
which
are
filled

buildings
access
to
them
is
usually

stony

i

strangers
are
welcome
to
eat
as
much
of
the
fruit
as
they
please
provided
that
they
return
the
stones
to
the
proprietor
it
is
true
that
nubra
exports
dried
apricots
and
the
women
were
splitting
and
drying
the
fruit
on
every
house
roof
but
the
special
of
the
tree
is
the
clear
white
fragrant
and
highly
illuminating
oil
made
from
the
kernels
by
the
simple
process
of
crushing
them
between
two
stones
in

temple
a
silver
bowl
holding
from
four
to
six
gallons
is
replenished
annually
with
this
oil
for
the

the

it
is
used
for

and
very
largely
in

were
laid
down
on

blue
cornflowers
and
marigolds
cultivated
for

ornament
were
in
all
the

and
the

were
in
gala
dress
and
loaded
with
coarse
jewellery
right
hearty
was
the
welcome
redslob
loved
and
therefore
was
loved
the
tibetans
to
him
were
not
but
brothers
he
drew
the
best
out
of
them
their
superstitions
and
beliefs
were
not
to
him
but
subjects
for
minute
investigation
and
study
his
courtesy
to
all
was
frank
and
dignified
in
his
dealings
he
was
scrupulously
just
he
was
intensely
interested
in
their
interests
his
tibetan
scholarship
and
knowledge
of
tibetan
sacred
literature
gave
him
almost
the
standing
of
an
abbot
among
them
and
his
medical
skill
and
knowledge
joyfully
used
for
their
benefit
on
former
occasions
had
won
their
regard
so
at
hundar
as
everywhere
else
the
elders
came
out
to
meet
us

cut
the

branches
away

into
long

experience
having
taught
the
tibetans
that
their
scarce
fodder
is
best
preserved
thus
from
breakage
and
waste
i
bought
hay
by
the
yard
for
gyalpo
our
food
in
this
hospitable
house
was
simple
apricots
fresh
or
dried
and
stewed
with
honey
milk
curds
and
cheese
sour
cream
peas
beans
balls
of
barley
dough
barley
porridge
and
of
abominable
things
a
beer
made
from
barley
was
offered
with
each
meal
and
tea
frequently
but
i
took
my
own
the
sly
i
have
mentioned
a
churn
as
part
of
the
of
the
in
tibet
the
churn
is
used
for
making
tea
i
give
the
recipe
six
persons
boil
a
teacupful
of
tea
in
three
pints
of
water
for
ten
minutes
with
a
heaped
of
soda
put
the
infusion
into
the
chum
with
one
pound
of
butter
and
a
small
tablespoonful
of
salt
churn
until
as
thick
as
cream
tea
made
after
this
fashion
holds
the
second
place
to
in
tibetan
affections
the
butter
according
to
our
thinking
is
always
rancid
the
mode
of
making
it
is
uncleanly
and
it
always
has
a
rank
flavour
from
the
goatskin
in
which
it
was
kept
its
value
is
enhanced
by
age
i
saw
skins
of
it
forty
fifty
and
even
sixty
years
old
which
were
very
highly
prized
and
would
only
be
opened
at
some
special
family
festival
or
funeral
during
the
three
days
of
our
visits
to
hundar
both
men
and
women
wore
their
festival
dresses
and
apparently
abandoned
most
of
their
ordinary
occupations
in
our
honour
the
men
were
very
anxious
that
i
should
be
and
made
many
grotesque
suggestions
on
the
subject
is
the
european
woman
always
writing
or
sewing
they
asked
she
very
poor
or
has
she
made
a
vow
visits
to
some
of
the
neighbouring
monasteries
were
eventually
proposed
and
turned
out
most
interesting
the
monastery
of
deskyid
to
which
we
made
a
three
days
expedition
is
from
its
size
and
picturesque
situation
the
most
imposing
in
nubra
built
on
a
majestic
spur
of
rock
rising
on
one
side
feet
perpendicularly
from
a
torrent
the
spur
itself
having
an
altitude
of
feet
with
red
peaks
rising
to
a
height
of
over
feet
behind
the
vast
irregular
pile
of
red
white
and
yellow
temples
towers
storehouses
cloisters
galleries
and
balconies
rising
for
feet
one
above
another
hanging
over
chasms
built
out
on
wooden
buttresses
and
surmounted
with
flags
tridents
and
tails
a
central
tower
or
keep
dominating
the
whole
it
is
perhaps
the
most
picturesque
object
i
have
ever
seen
well
worth
the
crossing
of
the
shayok
fords
my
painful
accident
and
much
besides
it
looks
inaccessible
but
in
fact
can
be
attained
by
rude
zigzags
of
a
thousand
steps
of
rock
some
natural
others
roughly
hewn
getting
worse
and
worse
as
they
rise
higher
till
the
later
zigzags
suggest
the
difficulties
of
the
ascent
of
the
great
pyramid
the
day
was
fearfully
hot
in
the
shade
and
the
naked
shining
surfaces
of
purple
rock
with
a
metallic
lustre
radiated
heat
my
grey
took
me
up
a
great
feat
and
the
tibetans
cheered
and
shouted
done
as
he
pluckily
leapt
up
the
great
slippery
rock
ledges
after
i
dismounted
any
number
of
willing
hands
hauled
and
helped
me
up
the
remaining
horrible
ascent
the
rugged
rudeness
of
which
is
quite
indescribable
the
inner
entrance
is
a
gateway
decorated
with
a
head
and
many
buddhist
emblems
high
above
on
a
rude
gallery
fifty
monks
were
gathered
with
their
musical
instruments
as
soon
as
the
or
abbot
the
most
perfect
merit
received
us
at
the
gate
the
monkish
orchestra
broke
forth
in
a
tornado
of
sound
of
a
most
tremendous
and
thrilling
quality
which
was
all
but
overwhelming
as
the
mountain
echoes
took
up
and
prolonged
the
sound
of
fearful
blasts
on
silver
horns
the
bellowing
thunder
of
drums
the
clash
of
cymbals
and
the
dissonance
of
a
number
of
monster
gongs
it
was
not
music
but
it
was
sublime
the
blasts
on
the
horns
are
to
welcome
a
great
personage
and
such
to
the
monks
who
despised
his
teaching
was
the
devout
and
learned
german
missionary
redslob
explained
that
i
had
seen
much
of
buddhism
in
ceylon
and
japan
and
wished
to
see
their
temples
so
with
our
train
of
peasants
and
muleteers
we
mounted
to
a
corridor
full
of
in
ragged
red
dresses
yellow
girdles
and
yellow
caps
where
we
were
presented
with
plates
of
apricots
and
the
door
of
the
lowest
of
the
seven
temples
heavily
grated
backwards
illustration
some
instruments
of
buddhist
worship
the
first
view
and
indeed
the
whole
view
of
this
temple
of
or
was
suggestive
of
a
frightful
with
its
rows
of
demon
gods
hideous
beyond
western
conception
engaged
in
torturing
writhing
and
bleeding
specimens
of
humanity
demon
masks
of
ancient
lacquer
hung
from
the
pillars
naked
swords
gleamed
in
motionless
hands
and
in
a
deep
recess
whose
was
rendered
by
one
lamp
was
that
indescribable
horror
the
executioner
of
the
lord
of
hell
his
many
brandished
arms
holding
instruments
of
torture
and
before
him
the
bell
the
thunderbolt
and
sceptre
the
holy
water
and
the
baptismal
flagon
our
fumed
on
the
still
air
monks
waved
censers
and
blasts
of
dissonant
music
woke
the
echoes
in
this
temple

justice

younger

some
hours
daily
in
the
supposed
contemplation
of
the
torments
reserved
for
the
unholy
in
the
highest
temple
that
of
peace
the
summer
sunshine
fell
on
shakya
thubba
and
the
buddhist
triad
seated
in
endless
serenity
the
walls
were
covered
with
frescoes
of
great
and
a
series
of
alcoves
each
with
an
image
representing
an
incarnation
of

round

temple

chapel
full
of
monstrous
images
and
piles

medallions

the
religious
classics
in
the
chapel

meditations
among
lighted
incense
sticks
monks
seated
before
images
were
telling
their
beads
with
the
object
of
working
themselves
into
a
state
of
ecstatic
contemplation
somewhat
resembling
a
certain
hypnotic
trance
for
there
are
undoubtedly
devout
though
the
majority
are
idle
and
unholy
it
must
be
understood
that
all
tibetan
literature
is
though
some
of
the
volumes
of
exquisite
calligraphy
on
parchment
which
for
our
benefit
were
divested
of
their
silken
and
brocaded
wrappings
contain
nothing
better
than
fairy
tales
and
stories
of
doubtful
morality
which
are
recited
by
the
to
the
accompaniment
of
incessant
cups
of
as
a
religious
duty
when
they
visit
their
in
the
winter
the
deskyid
contains
all
of
whom
have
been
educated
at
lhassa
a
younger
son
in
every
household
becomes
a
monk
and
occasionally
enters
upon
his
vocation
as
an
acolyte
pupil
as
soon
as
weaned
at
the
age
of
thirteen
these
acolytes
are
sent
to
study
at
lhassa
for
five
or
seven
years
their
departure
being
made
the
occasion
of
a
great
village
feast
with
several
days
of
religious
observances
the
close
connection
with
lhassa
especially
in
the
case
of
the
yellow
gives
nubra
buddhism
a
singular
interest
all
the
larger
have
their
prototype
in
lhassa
all
ceremonial
has
originated
in
lhassa
every
instrument
of
worship
has
been
consecrated
in
lhassa
and
every
is
educated
in
the
learning
only
to
be
obtained
at
lhassa
buddhism
is
indeed
the
most
salient
feature
of
nubra
there
are
everywhere
the
roads
are
lined
by
miles
of
and
and
flags
inscribed
with
sacred
words
in
sanskrit
flutter
from
every
roof
there
are
processions
of
red
and
yellow
every
act
in
trade
agriculture
and
social
life
needs
the
sanction
of
sacerdotalism
whatever
exists
of
wealth
is
in
the
which
also
have
a
monopoly
of
learning
and
monks
closely
linked
with
the
laity
yet
ruling
all
affairs
of
life
and
death
and
beyond
death
are
all
connected
by
education
tradition
and
authority
with
lhassa
we
remained
long
on
the
blazing
roof
of
the
highest
tower
of
the
while
good
redslob
disputed
with
the
abbot
the
things
pertaining
to
the
kingdom
of
god
the
monks
standing
round
laughed
sneeringly
they
had
shown
a
little
interest
said
on
his
earlier
visits
the
abbot
accepted
a
copy
of
the
gospel
of
john
matthew
he
observed
very
laughable
reading
blasts
of
wild
music
and
the
braying
of
colossal
horns
honoured
our
departure
and
our
difficult
descent
to
the
apricot
groves
of
deskyid
on
our
return
to
hundar
the
grain
was
ripe
on
gergan
fields
the
first
ripe
ears
were
cut
off
offered
to
the
family
divinity
and
were
then
bound
to
the
pillars
of
the
house
in
the
comparatively
fertile
nubra
valley
the
wheat
and
barley
are
cut
not
rooted
up
while
they
cut
the
grain
the
men
chant
it
increase
we
will
give
to
the
poor
we
will
give
to
the
with
every
stroke
they
believe
that
it
can
be
made
to
multiply
both
under
the
sickle
and
in
the
threshing
and
perform
many
religious
rites
for
its
increase
while
it
is
in
sheaves
after
eight
days
the
corn
is
trodden
out
by
oxen
on
a
renewed
every
year
after
winnowing
with
wooden
forks
they
make
the
grain
into
a
pyramid
insert
a
sacred
symbol
and
pile
upon
it
the
threshing
instruments
and
sacks
erecting
an
axe
on
the
apex
with
its
blade
turned
to
the
west
as
that
is
the
quarter
from
which
demons
are
supposed
to
come
in
the
afternoon
they
feast
round
it
always
giving
a
portion
to
the
axe
saying
is
yours
it
belongs
not
to
me
at
dusk
they
pour
it
into
the
sacks
again
chanting
it
increase
but
these
are
not
removed
to
the
granary
until
late
at
night
at
an
hour
when
the
hands
of
the
demons
are
too
much
benumbed
by
the
nightly
frost
to
diminish
the
store
at
the
beginning
of
every
one
of
these
operations
the
presence
of
is
essential

announce
the
auspicious

ceremonies

receive
fees
and
are
regaled
with
abundant
and

fat
of
the
land
in
hundar
as
elsewhere
we
were
made
very
welcome
in
all
the
houses
i
have
described
the
dwelling
of
gergan
the
poorer
peasants
occupy
similar
houses
but
roughly
built
and
only
and
the
floors
are
merely
clay
in
them
also
the
very
numerous
lower
rooms
are
used
for
cattle
and
fodder
only
while
the
upper
part
consists
of
an
inner
or
winter
room
an
outer

family
life
presents
some
curious
features
in
the
disposal
in
marriage
of
a
girl
her
eldest
brother
has
more
than
the
parents
the
eldest
son
brings
home
the
bride
to
his
father
house
but
at
a
given
age
the
old
people
are
they
retire
to
a
small
house
which
may
be
termed
a
house
and
the
eldest
son
assumes
the
patrimony
and
the
rule
of
affairs
i
have
not
met
with
a
similar
custom
anywhere
in
the
east
it
is
difficult
to
speak
of
tibetan
life
with
all
its
affection
and
jollity
as
for
buddhism
which
enjoins
monastic
life
and
usually
celibacy
along
with
it
on
eleven
thousand
out
of
a
total
population
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
farther
restrains
the
increase
of
population
within
the
limits
of
sustenance
by
inculcating
and
rigidly
upholding
the
system
of
polyandry
permitting
marriage
only
to
the
eldest
son
the
heir
of
the
land
while
the
bride
accepts
all
his
brothers
as
inferior
or
subordinate
husbands
thus
attaching
the
whole
family
to
the
soil
and
family
the
children
being
regarded
legally
as
the
property
of
the
eldest
son
who
is
addressed
by
them
as
father
his
brothers
receiving
the
title
of
father
the
resolute
determination
on
economic
as
well
as
religious
grounds
not
to
abandon
this
ancient
custom
is
the
most
formidable
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
reception
of
christianity
by
the
tibetans
the
women
cling
to
it
they
say
have
three
or
four
men
to
help
us
instead
of
one
and
sneer
at
the
dulness
and
monotony
of
european
monogamous
life
a
woman
said
to
me
i
had
only
one
husband
and
he
died
i
should
be
a
widow
if
i
have
two
or
three
i
am
never
a
widow
the
word
is
with
them
a
term
of
reproach
and
is
applied
abusively
to
animals
and
men
children
are
brought
up
to
be
very
obedient
to
fathers
and
mother
and
to
take
great
care
of
little
ones
and
cattle
parental
affection
is
strong
husbands
and
wives
beat
each
other
but
separation
usually
follows
a
violent
outbreak
of
this
kind
it
is
the
custom
for
the
men
and
women
of
a
village
to
assemble
when
a
bride
enters
the
house
of
her
husbands
each
of
them
presenting
her
with
three
rupees
the
tibetan
wife
far
from
spending
these
gifts
on
personal
adornment
looks
ahead
contemplating
possible
contingencies
and
immediately
hires
a
field
the
produce
of
which
is
her
own
and
which
accumulates
year
after
year
in
a
separate
granary
so
that
she
may
not
be
portionless
in
case
she
leaves
her
husband

it
was
impossible
not
to
become
attached
to
the

lived
so
completely
among
them
and
met
with
such
unbounded
goodwill
feasts
were
given
in

honour

alacrity

kindness
shown
by

there
was
not
a

or

of
the
men

the
villages
always
sat
by

at

oppressions
exercised
by

inevitable
redslob
said
that
when
on
different
occasions
he
was
smitten
by
heavy
sorrows
he
felt
no
difference
between
the
tibetan
feeling
and
expression
of
sympathy
and
that
of
europeans
a
stronger
testimony
to
the
effect
produced
by
his
years
of
loving
service
could
scarcely
be
given
than
our
welcome
in
nubra
during
the
dangerous
illness
which
followed
anxious
faces
thronged
his
humble
doorway
as
early
as

of
day

the
stream
of
friendly
inquiries
never
ceased
till
sunset
and
when
he
died
the
people
of
ladak

nubra
wept
and
a
great
mourning
for
him
as
for
their
truest
friend
industry
in
nubra

the
condition
of

redslob
took
a
severe

which
produced
an
alarming
attack

never

recovered
we
started
on
a
grim
snowy
morning
with

four
led
horses

a
number
of

several
more
having
been

on
in

steps
in
the
glacier
and
roughen
them
with

within
certain
limits
the

grows
greener

great
sheets

skirted
a

a
glorious
view
of
the
kharzong
glacier

the
pass
a
nearly
perpendicular
wall
of
rock
bearing
up
a
steep
glacier
and
a
snowfield
of
great
width
and
depth

tower
pinnacles
of

presented
to
all

an

dazzling
whiteness

us
over

four
hours
without

and
from
the

a
sharp
ridge

in

we
looked
our
last

southward
for
many
a
weary
mile
to
the
indus

lying
in

fully
two
dozen
carcases
of
horses
newly
dead
lay
in
cavities
of

were
ill

nearly
blind

i
was
obliged
to
ride
my
into

a
severe
march
of
thirteen
hours
down
miles
of
crumbling
zigzags
and
then
among
villages
of

terraces

the
grand
view
of
the
palace
with
its
and
clustering

of
the
desert

itself
burst
suddenly
upon
us

our
benumbed
and
stiffened
limbs
thawed
in

hot
sunshine

pitched
my
tent
in
a
poplar
grove
for
a
fortnight
near
the
moravian
compounds

close
to
the

spotless
reputation
every
one
places
unlimited
confidence
in
his
integrity

truthfulness
and
his
religious

has
been
attested
by
many

he
is
a
ladaki
and
the
family

was
at

a
few
miles
from

he
was
baptized
in
lahul
at
his
father
having
been
a
christian
he
learned
urdu
and
was
for
ten
years
mission
schoolmaster
in
kylang
but
returned
to
leh
a
few
years
ago
as
postmaster
his
dwelling
at
stok
was
destroyed
by
order
of
the
wazir
and
his
property
confiscated
after
many
unsuccessful
efforts
had
been
made
to
win
him
back
to
buddhism
afterwards
he
was
detained
by
the
wazir
and
compelled
to
serve
as
a
sepoy
till
heyde
went
to
the
council
and
obtained
his
release
his
house
in
leh
has
been
more
than
once
burned
by
incendiaries
but
he
pursues
a
quiet
even

brings
up
his

the
best

by
steady
industry
although
of
noble
birth
and
asks
nothing
of
any
one
his
morning
and
night
as
he
daily
passed
my
tent
with
clockwork
regularity
were
full
of
cheery
friendliness
he
gave
much
useful
information
about
tibetan
customs
and
his
ready
helpfulness
greatly
facilitated
the
difficult
arrangements
for
my
farther
journey
illustration
a
woman
the
leh
which
i
had
left
so
dull
and
quiet
was
full
of
strangers
traffic
and
noise
the
neat
little
moravian
church
was
filled
by
a
motley
crowd
each
sunday
in
which
the
few
christians
were
distinguishable
by
their
clean
faces
and
clothes
and
their
devout
air
and
the
medical
mission
hospital
and
dispensary
which
in
winter
have
an
average
attendance
of
only
a
hundred
patients
a
month
were
daily
thronged
with
natives
of
india
and
kashmir
baltis
yarkandis
dards
and
tibetans
in
my
visits
with
marx
i
observed
what
was
confirmed
by
four
months
experience
of
the
tibetan
villagers
that
rheumatism
inflamed
eyes
and
eyelids
and
old
age
are
the
chief
tibetan
maladies
some
of
the
dards
and
baltis
were
lepers
and
the
natives
of
india
brought
malarial
fever
dysentery
and
other
serious
diseases
the
hospital
which
is
supported
by
the
indian
government
is
most
comfortable
a
haven
of
rest
for
those
who
fall
sick
by
the
way
the
hospital
assistants
are
intelligent
thoroughly
young
tibetans
who
by
dint
of
careful
drilling
and
an
affectionate
desire
to
please
teacher
with
the
medicine
box
have
become
fairly
trustworthy
they

christians

the
neat
dispensary
at
a
gong
summons
the
patients
to
the
operating
room
for
a
short
religious
service
usually
about
fifty
were
present
and
a
number
more
who
had
some
curiosity
about
way
but
did
not
care
to
be
seen
at
christian
worship
hung
about
the
doorways
marx
read
a
few
verses
from
the
gospels
explaining
them
in
a
homely
manner
and
concluded
with
the
lord
prayer
then
the
were
carefully
and
gently
treated
leprous
limbs
were
bathed
and
anointed
the
wards
were
visited
at
noon
and
again
at
sunset
and
in
the
afternoons
operations
were
performed
with
the
most
careful
antiseptic
precautions
which
are
supposed
to
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
away
evil
spirits
from
the
wounds
the
tibetans
in
practice
are
very
simple
in
their
applications
of
medical
remedies
rubbing
with
butter
is
their
great
panacea
they
have
a
dread
of
and
instead
of
burning
its
victims
they
throw
them
into
their
rapid
torrents
if
an
isolated
case
occur
the
sufferer
is
carried
to
a
where
he
is
left
to
recover
or
die
if
a
epidemic
is
in
the
province
the
people
of
the
villages
in
which
it
has
not
yet
appeared
place
thorns
on
their
bridges
and
boundaries
to
scare
away
the
evil
spirits
which
are
supposed
to
carry
the
disease
in
ordinary
illnesses
if
butter
taken
internally
as
well
as
rubbed
into
the
skin
does
not
cure
the
patient
the
are
summoned
to
the
rescue
they
make
a
a
half
figure
of
the
sick
person
dress
it
in
his
or
her
clothes
and
ornaments
and
place
it
in
the
courtyard
where
they
sit
round
it
reading
passages
from
the
sacred
classics
fitted
for
the
occasion
after
a
time
all
rise
except
the
superior
who
continues
reading
and
taking
small
drums
in
their
left
hands
they
recite
incantations
and
dance
wildly
round
the
believing
or
at
least
leading
the
people
to
believe
that
by
this
ceremony
the
malady
supposed
to
be
the
work
of
a
demon
will
be
transferred
to
the
image
afterwards
the
clothes
and
ornaments
are
presented
to
them
and
the
figure
is
carried
in
procession
out
of
the
yard
and
village
and
is
burned
if
the
patient
becomes
worse
the
friends
are
apt
to
resort
to
the
medical
skill
of
the
missionaries
if
he
dies
they
are
blamed
and
if
he
recovers
the
take
the
credit
at
some
little
distance
outside
leh
are
the
cremation
grounds
desert
places
destitute
of
any
other
vegetation
than
the
each
family
has
its
furnace
kept
in
good
repair
the
place
is
doleful
and
a
funeral
scene
on
the
only
sunless
day
i
experienced
in
ladak
was
indescribably
dismal
after
death
no
one
touches
the
corpse
but
the
who
assemble
in
numbers
in
the
case
of
a
rich
man
the
senior
offers
the
first
prayers
and
lifts
the
lock
which
all
tibetans
wear
at
the
back
of
the
head
in
order
to
liberate
the
soul
if
it
is
still
clinging
to
the
body
at
the
same
time
he
touches
the
region
of
the
heart
with
a
dagger
the
people
believe
that
a
drop
of
blood
on
the
head
marks
the
spot
where
the
soul
has
made
its
exit
any
good
clothing
in
which
the
person
has
died
is
then
removed
the
blacksmith
beats
a
drum
and
the
corpse
covered
with
a
white
sheet
next
the
dress
and
a
coloured
one
above
is
carried
out
of
the
house
to
be
worshipped
by
the
relatives
who
walk
seven
times
round
it
the
women
then
retire
to
the
house
and
the
chief
recites
liturgical
passages
from
the
formularies
afterwards
the
relatives
retire
and
the
corpse
is
carried
to
the
by
men
who
have
the
same
tutelar
deity
as
the
deceased
the
leading
walks
first
then
come
men
with
flags
followed
by
the
blacksmith
with
the
drum
and
next
the
corpse
with
another
man
beating
a
drum
behind
it
meanwhile
the
are
praying
for
the
repose
and
quieting
of
the
soul
which
is
hovering
about
desiring
to
return
the
attendant
friends
each
of
whom
has
carried
a
piece
of
wood
to
the
arrange
the
fuel
with
butter
on
the
furnace
the
corpse
wrapped
in
the
white
sheet
is
put
in
and
fire
is
applied
the
process
of
destruction
in
a
rich
man
case
takes
about
an
hour
during
the
burning
the
read
in
high
hoarse
monotones
and
the
blacksmiths
beat
their
drums
the
depart
first
and
the
blacksmiths
after
worshipping
the
ashes
shout
nothing
to
do
with
us
now
and
run
rapidly
away
at
dawn
the
following
day
a
man
whose
business
it
is
searches
among
the
ashes
for
the
footprints
of
animals
and
according
to
the
footprints
found
so
it
is
believed
will
be
the
of
the
soul
some
of
the
ashes
are
taken
to
the
where
the
mix
them
with
clay
put
them
into
oval
or
circular
moulds
and
stamp
them
with
the
image
of
buddha
these
are
preserved
in
and
in
the
house
of
the
nearest
relative
of
the
deceased
but
in
the
case
of
men
they
are
retained
in
the
where
they
can
be
purchased
by
the
devout
after
a
cremation
much
is
consumed
by
the
friends
who
make
presents
to
the
bereaved
family
the
value
of
each
is
carefully
entered
in
a
book
so
that
a
precise
return
may
be
made
when
a
similar
occasion
occurs
until
the
fourth
day
after
death
it
is
believed
to
be
impossible
to
quiet
the
soul
on
that
day
a
piece
of
paper
is
inscribed
with
prayers
and
requests
to
the
soul
to
be
quiet
and
this
is
burned
by
the
with
suitable
ceremonies
and
rites
of
a
more
or
less
elaborate
kind
are
afterwards
performed
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
accompanied
with
prayers
that
it
may
get
good
path
for
its
and
food
is
placed
in
conspicuous
places
about
the
house
that
it
may
understand
that
its
relatives
are
willing
to
support
it
the
mourners
for
some
time
wear
wretched
clothes
and
neither
dress
their
hair
nor
wash
their
faces
every
year
the
sell
by
auction
the
clothing
and
ornaments
which
are
their
perquisites
at
funerals
for
these
and
other
curious
details
concerning
tibetan
customs
i
am
indebted
to
the
kindness
and
careful
investigations
of
the
late
rev
redslob
of
leh
and
the
rev
heyde
of
kylang
the
moravian
missionaries
have
opened
a
school
in
leh
and
the
wazir
finding
that
the
leh
people
are
the
worst
educated
in
the
country
ordered
that
one
child
at
least
in
each
family
should
be
sent
to
it
this
awakened
grave
suspicions
and
the
people
hunted
for
reasons
for
it
boys
are
to
be
trained
as
porters
and
made
to
carry

over
the
mountains
said
some
said
others

made

of
all
foreigners
no
matter
what
their
nationality
is
are
supposed
to
be
english
others
again
said
are
to
be
kidnapped
and
so
the
decree
was
ignored
till
redslob
and
marx
went
among
the
parents
and
explained
matters
and
a
large
attendance
was
the
result
for
the
tibetans
of
the
trade
route
have
come
to
look
upon
the
acquisition
of
learning
as
the
to
government
appointments
at
ten
rupees
per
month
attendance
on
religious
instruction
was
left
optional
but
after
a
time
sixty
pupils
were
regularly
present
at
the
daily
reading
and
explanation
of
the
gospels
tibetan
fathers
teach
their
sons
to
write
to
read
the
sacred
classics
and
to
calculate
with
a

on
wires
if
farther
instruction
is
thought
desirable
the
boys
are
sent
to
the
and
even
to
the
schools
at
lhassa
the
tibetans
willingly
receive
and
read
translations
of
our
christian
books
and
some
go
so
far
as
to
think
that
their
teachings
are
than
those
of
their
own
indicating
their
opinions
by
tearing
pages
out
of
the
gospels

rolling
them

entered
through
a
and
colossal
lead
to
the
castle
the
village
of
stok
the
prettiest
and
most
prosperous
in
ladak
fills
up
the
mouth
of
a
gorge
with
its
large
among
poplar
apricot
and
willow
plantations
and
irrigated
terraces
of
barley
and
is
imposing
as
well
as
pretty
for
the
two
roads
by
which
it
is
approached
are
avenues
of
lofty
and
broad
all
in
excellent
repair
knolls
and
deeply
coloured
spurs
of
naked
rock
most
picturesquely
crowded
with
rise
above
the
greenery
breaking
the
purple
gloom
of
the
gorge
which
cuts
deeply
into
the
mountains
and
supplies
from
its
rushing
glacier
torrent
the
living
waters
which
create
this
delightful
oasis
the
came
forth
to
meet
us
bearing
apricots
and
cheeses
as
the
gyalpo
greeting
and
conducted
us
to
the
a
sloping
lawn
in
a
with
many
a
natural
bower
of
the
graceful
the
tents
were
pitched
afternoon
tea
was
on
a
table
outside
a
clear
swift
stream
made
fitting
music
the
dissonance
of
the
ceaseless
beating
of
gongs
and
drums
in
the
castle
temple
was
softened
by
distance
the
air
was
cool
a
lemon
light
bathed
the
foreground
and
to
the
north
across
the
indus
the
great
mountains
of
the
leh
range
with
every
cleft
defined
in
purple
or
blue
lifted
their
vermilion
peaks
into
a
rosy
sky
it
was
the
poetry
and
luxury
of
travel
at
leh
i
was
obliged
to
dismiss
the
for
prolonged
misconduct
and
cruelty
to
gyalpo
and
mando
undertook
to
take
care
of
him
the
animal
had
always
been
held
by
two
men
while
the
groomed
him
with
difficulty
but
at
stok
when
mando
rubbed
him
down
he
quietly
went
on
feeding
and
laid
his
lovely
head
on
the
lad
shoulder
with
a
soft
cooing
sound
from
that
moment
mando
could
do
anything
with
him
and
a
singular
attachment
grew
up
between
man
and
horse
towards
sunset
we
were
received
by
the
gyalpo
the
castle
loses
nothing
of
its
picturesqueness
on
a
nearer
view
and
everything
about
it
is
trim
and
in
good
order
it
is
a
substantial
mass
of
stone
building
on
a
lofty
rock
the
irregularities
of
which
have
been
taken
most
artistic
advantage
of
in
order
to
give
picturesque
irregularity
to
the
edifice
which
while
six
storeys
high
in
some
places
is
only
three
in
others
as
in
the
palace
of
leh
the
walls
slope
inwards
from
the
base
where
they
are
ten
feet
thick
and
projecting
balconies
of
brown
wood
and
grey
stone
relieve
their
monotony
we
were
received
at
the
entrance
by
a
number
of
red
who
took
us
up
five
flights
of
rude
stairs
to
the
reception
room
where
we
were
introduced
to
the
gyalpo
who
was
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
monks
and
except
that
his
hair
was
not
shorn
and
that
he
wore
a
silver
brocade
cap
and
large
gold
earrings
and
bracelets
was
dressed
in
red
like
them
throneless
and
childless
the
gyalpo
has
given
himself
up
to
religion
he
has
covered
the
castle
roof
with
buddhist
emblems
not
represented
in
the
sketch
from
a
pole
forty
feet
long
on
the
terrace
floats
a
broad
streamer
of
equal
length
completely
covered
with
mani
padne
and
he
has
surrounded
himself
with
who
conduct
nearly
ceaseless
services
in
the
sanctuary
the
attainment
of
merit
as
his
creed
leads
him
to
understand
it
is
his
one
aim
in
life
he
loves
the
seclusion
of
stok
and
rarely
visits
the
palace
in
leh
except
at
the
time
of
the
winter
games
when
the
whole
population
assembles
in
cheery
orderly
crowds
to
witness
races
polo
and
archery
matches
and
a
species
of
hockey
he
interests
himself
in
the
prosperity
of
stok
plants
poplars
willows
and
fruit
trees
and
keeps
the
castle
and
in
admirable
repair
stok
castle
is
as
massive
as
any
of
our
mediaeval
buildings
but
is
far
lighter
and
roomier
it
is
most
interesting
to
see
a
style
of
architecture
and
civilisation
which
bears
not
a
solitary
trace
of
european
influence
not
even
in
manchester
cottons
or
russian
gimcracks
the
gyalpo
room
was
only
roofed
for
six
feet
within
the
walls
where
it
was
supported
by
red
pillars
above
the
deep
blue
tibetan
sky
was
flushing
with
the
red
of
sunset
and
from
a
noble
window
with
a
covered
stone
balcony
there
was
an
enchanting
prospect
of
red
ranges
passing
into
translucent
amethyst
the
partial
ceiling
is
painted
in
arabesques
and
at
one
end
of
the
room
is
an
alcove
much
enriched
with
bold
wood
carving
illustration
the
castle
of
stok
the
gyalpo
was
seated
on
a
carpet
on
the
floor
a
rather
man
of
he
placed
us
on
a
carpet
beside
him
and
coffee
honey
and
apricots
were
brought
in
but
the
conversation
flagged
he
neither
suggested
anything
nor
took
up
marx
suggestions
fortunately
we
had
brought
our
and
the
views
of
several
places
were
recognised
and
were
found
interesting
the
and
servants
who
had
remained
respectfully
standing
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
even
the
gyalpo
became
animated
so
our
visit
ended
successfully
there
is
a
doorway
from
the
reception
room
into
the
sanctuary
and
after
a
time
fully
thirty
passed
in
and
began
service
but
the
gyalpo
only
stood
on
his
carpet
there
is
only
a
half
light
in
this
temple
which
is
further
obscured
by
scores
of
smoked
and
dusty
bannerets
of
gold
and
silver
brocade
hanging
from
the
roof
in
addition
to
the
usual
buddhist
emblems
there
are
musical
instruments
exquisitely
inlaid
or
enriched
with
work
of
gold
and
silver
of
great
antiquity
and
bows
of
singular
strength
requiring
two
men
to
bend
them
which
are
made
of
small
pieces
of
horn
cleverly
joined
gabbled
liturgies
at
railroad
speed
beating
drums
and
clashing
cymbals
as
an
accompaniment
while
others
blew
occasional
blasts
on
the
colossal
silver
horns
or
trumpets
which
probably
resemble
those
with
which
jericho
was
encompassed
the
music
the
discordant
and
monotones
and
the
revolting
odours
of
stale
smoke
of
juniper
chips
of
rancid
butter
and
of
unwashed
woollen
clothes
which
drifted
through
the
doorway
were
overpowering
attempted
fights
among
the
horses
woke
me
often
during
the
night
and
the
sound
of
worship
was
always
borne
over
the
still
air
marx
left
on
the
third
day
after
we
had
visited
the
monastery
of
hemis
the
richest
in
ladak
holding
large
landed
property
and
possessing
much
metallic
wealth
including
a
of
silver
and
gold
thirty
feet
high
in
one
of
its
many
halls
approached
by
silver
steps
and
incrusted
with
precious
stones
there
is
also
much
fine
work
in
brass
and
bronze
hemis
abounds
in
decorated
buildings
most
picturesquely
placed
it
has
three
hundred
and
is
regarded
as
sight
of
ladak
at
upschi
after
a
day
march
over
blazing
gravel
i
left
the
rushing
indus
which
i
had
followed
from
the
bridge
of
khalsi
where
a
turbulent
torrent
the
upshi
water
joins
it
descending
through
a
gorge
so
narrow
that
the
track
which
at
all
times
is
blasted
on
the
face
of
the
precipice
is
occasionally
scaffolded
a
very
extensive
had
carried
away
the
path
and
rendered
several
fords
necessary
and
before
i
reached
it
rumour
was
busy
with
the
peril
it
was
true
that
the
day
before
several
mules
had
been
carried
away
and
drowned
that
many
loads
had
been
sacrificed
and
that
one
native
traveller
had
lost
his
life
so
i
started
my
caravan
at
daybreak
to
get
the
water
at
its
lowest
and
ascended
the
gorge
which
is
an
absolutely
verdureless
rift
in
mountains
of
most
brilliant
and
fantastic
stratification
at
the
first
ford
mando
was
carried
down
the
river
for
a
short
distance
the
second
was
deep
and
strong
and
a
caravan
of
valuable
goods
had
been
there
for
two
days
afraid
to
risk
the
crossing
my
lahulis
who
always
showed
a
great
lack
of
stamina
sat
down
sobbing
and
beating
their
breasts
their
sole
wealth
they
said
was
in
their
baggage
animals
and
the
river
was
and
demon
lived
in
it
who
paralysed
the
horses
legs
much
experience
of
orientals
and
of
travel
has
taught
me
to
surmount
difficulties
in
my
own
way
so
beckoning
to
two
men
from
the
opposite
side
who
came
over
shakily
with
linked
arms
i
took
the
two
strong
ropes
which
i
always
carry
on
my
saddle
and
roped
these
men
together
and
to
gyalpo
halter
with
one
and
lashed
mando
and
the
guide
together
with
the
other
giving
them
the
stout
thongs
behind
the
saddle
to
hold
on
to
and
in
this
compact
mass
we
stood
the
strong
rush
of
the
river
safely
the
paralysing
chill
of
its
icy
waters
being
a
far
more
obvious
peril
all
the
baggage
animals
were
brought
over
in
the
same
way
and
the
lahulis
praised
their
gods
at
gya
a
wild
hamlet
the
last
in
ladak
proper
i
met
a
working
naturalist
whom
i
had
seen
twice
before
and
with
him
much
of
the
way
eleven
days
of
solitary
desert
succeeded
the
reader
has
probably
understood
that
no
part
of
the
indus
shayok
and
nubra
valleys
which
make
up
most
of
the
province
of
ladak
is
less
than
feet
in
altitude
and
that
the
remainder
is
composed
of
precipitous
mountains
with
glaciers
and
snowfields
ranging
from
to
feet
and
that
the
villages
are
built
mainly
on
alluvial
soil
where
possibilities
of
irrigation
exist
but
rupchu
has
peculiarities
of
its
own
between
gya
and
darcha
the
first
hamlet
in
lahul
are
three
huge
passes
the
toglang
feet
in
altitude
the
lachalang
and
the
baralacha
all
easy
except
for
the
difficulties
arising
from
the
highly
rarefied
air
the
mountains
of
the
region
which
are
from
to
feet
in
altitude
are
seldom
precipitous
or
picturesque
except
the
huge
red
needles
which
guard
the
lachalang
pass
but
are
rather
protuberances
with
arid
surfaces
of
disintegrated
rock
among
these
are
remarkable
plateaux
which
are
taken
advantage
of
by
caravans
and
which
have
elevations
of
from
to
feet
there
are
few
permanent
rivers
or
streams
the
lakes
are
salt
beside
the
springs
and
on
the
plateaux
there
is
scanty
vegetation
chiefly
aromatic
herbs
but
on
the
whole
rupchu
is
a
desert
of
arid
gravel
its
only
inhabitants
are
nomads
and
on
the
ten
marches
of
the
trade
route
the
bridle
paths
on
which
in
some
places
labour
has
been
spent
the
tracks
not
always
very
legible
made
by
the
passage
of
caravans
and
rude
dykes
behind
which
travellers
may
shelter
themselves
from
the
wind
are
the
only
traces
of
man
herds
of
the
the
wild
horse
of
some
naturalists
and
the
wild
ass
of
others
graceful
and
beautiful
creatures
graze
within
gunshot
of
the
track
without
alarm
i
had
thought
ladak
windy
but
rupchu
is
the
home
of
the
winds
and
the
marches
must
be
arranged
for
the
quietest
time
of
the
day
happily
the
gales
blow
with
clockwork
regularity
the
day
wind
from
the
south
and
rising
punctually
at
and
attaining
its
maximum
at
while
the
night
wind
from
the
north
and
rises
about
and
ceases
about
perfect
silence
is
rare
the
highly
rarefied
air
rushing
at
great
speed
when
at
its
worst
deprives
the
traveller
of
breath
skins
his
face
and
hands
and
paralyses
the
baggage
animals
in
fact
neither
man
nor
beast
can
face
it
the
horses
tail
and
crowd
together
and
the
men
build
up
the
baggage
into
a
wall
and
crouch
in
the
lee
of
it
the
heat
of
the
solar
rays
is
at
the
same
time
fearful
at
lachalang
at
a
height
of
over
feet
i
noted
a
solar
temperature
of
only
below
the
boiling
point
of
water
in
the
same
region
which
is
about
to
make
up
for
this
the
mercury
falls
below
the
freezing
point
every
night
of
the
year
even
in
august
the
difference
of
temperature
in
twelve
hours
often
exceeding
the
rupchu
nomads
however
delight
in
this
climate
of
extremes
and
regard
leh
as
a
place
only
to
be
visited
in
winter
and
kulu
and
kashmir
as
if
they
were
the
malarial
swamps
of
the
congo
illustration
first
village
in
kulu
we
crossed
the
toglang
pass
at
a
height
of
feet
with
less
suffering
from
than
on
either
the
digar
or
kharzong
passes
indeed
gyalpo
carried
me
over
it
stopping
to
take
breath
every
few
yards
it
was
then
a
long
dreary
march
to
the
of
tsala
where
the
spend
the
four
summer
months
the
guides
and
baggage
animals
lost
the
way
and
did
not
appear
until
the
next
day
and
in
consequence
the
servants
slept
unsheltered
in
the
snow
news
travels
as
if
by
magic
in
desert
places
towards
evening
while
riding
by
a
stream
up
a
long
and
tedious
valley
i
saw
a
number
of
moving
specks
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
and
down
came
a
surge
of
horsemen
riding
furiously
just
as
they
threatened
to
sweep
gyalpo
away
they
threw
their
horses
on
their
haunches
in
one
moment
were
on
the
ground
which
they
touched
with
their
foreheads
presented
me
with
a
plate
of
apricots
and
the
next
vaulted
into
their
saddles
and
dashing
up
the
valley
were
soon
out
of
sight
in
another
there
was
a
second
wild
rush
of
horsemen
the
headman
dismounted
threw
himself
on
his
face
kissed
my
hand
vaulted
into
the
saddle
and
then
led
a
swirl
of
his
tribesmen
at
a
gallop
in
circles
round
me
till
they
subsided
into
the
decorum
of
an
escort
an
elevated
plateau
with
some
vegetation
on
it
a
row
of
forty
tents
but
not
a
bright
rapid
river
wild
hills
long
lines
of
white
sheep
converging
towards
the
camp
rampaging
down
the
hillsides
men
running
to
meet
us
and
women
and
children
in
the
distance
were
singularly
idealised
in
the
golden
glow
of
a
cool
moist
evening
two
men
took
my
bridle
and
two
more
proceeded
to
put
their
hands
on
my
stirrups
but
gyalpo
kicked
them
to
the
right
and
left
amidst
shrieks
of
laughter
after
which
with
frantic
gesticulations
and
yells
of
i
was
led
through
the
river
in
triumph
and
hauled
off
my
horse
the
tribesmen
were
much
excited
some
dashed
about
performing
feats
of
horsemanship
others
brought
apricots
and
made
with
apricot
oil
or
rushed
to
the
tents
returning
with
rugs
some
cleared
the
of
stones
and
raised
a
stone
platform
and
a
flock
of
goats
exquisitely
white
from
the
daily
swims
across
the
river
were
brought
to
be
milked
gradually
and
shrinkingly
the
women
and
children
drew
near
but
bengali
servant
threatened
them
with
a
whip
when
there
was
a
general
stampede
the
women
running
like
hares
i
had
trained
my
servants
to
treat
the
natives
courteously
and
addressed
some
rather
strong
language
to
the
offender
and
afterwards
succeeded
in
enticing
all
the
fugitives
back
by
showing
my
sketches
which
gave
boundless
pleasure
and
led
to
very
numerous
requests
for
portraits
the
though
he
had
the
oblique
mongolian
eyes
was
a
handsome
young
man
with
a
good
nose
and
mouth
he
was
dressed
like
the
others
in
a
girdled
of
coarse
serge
but
wore
a
red
cap
turned
up
over
the
ears
with
fine
fur
a
silver
inkhorn
and
a
yarkand
knife
in
a
chased
silver
sheath
in
his
girdle
and
leather
shoes
with
points
the
people
prepared
one
of
their
own
tents
for
me
and
laying
down
a
number
of
rugs
of
their
own
dyeing
and
weaving
assured
me
of
an
unbounded
welcome
as
a
friend
of
their
redslob
and
then
proposed
that
i
should
visit
their
tents
accompanied
by
all
the
elders
of
the
tribe
chapter
v
climate
and
natural
features
the
last
chapter
left
me
with
the
chief
and
elders
of
the
starting
on
round
of
visits
and
it
was
not
till
nightfall
that
the
solemn
ceremony
was
concluded
each
of
the
fifty
tents
was
visited
at
every
one
a
huge
savage
tibetan
mastiff
made
an
attempt
to
fly
at
me
and
was
pounced
upon
and
held
down
by
a
woman
little
bigger
than
himself
and
in
each
cheese
and
milk
were
offered
and
refused
in
all
i
received
a
hearty
welcome
for
the
sake
of
the
father
redslob
who
designated
these
people
as
simplest
and
kindliest
people
on
earth
this
tribe
numbering
five
hundred
souls
makes
four
moves
in
the
year
dividing
in
summer
and
uniting
in
a
valley
very
free
from
snow
in
the
winter
they
are
an
exclusively
pastoral
people
and
possess
large
herds
of
and
ponies
and
immense
flocks
of
sheep
and
goats
the
latter
almost
entirely
the
beautiful
goat
from
the
undergrowth
at
the
base
of
the
long
hair
of
which
the
fine
kashmir
shawls
are
made
this
is
a
provision
which
nature
makes
against
the
intense
cold
of
these
altitudes
and
grows
on
sheep
and
dogs
as
well
as
on
most
of
the
wild
animals
the
sheep
is
the
big
hornless
the
and
sheep
are
the
load
carriers
of
rupchu
small
or
easily
divided
merchandise
is
carried
by
sheep
and
bulkier
goods
by
and
the
make
a
great
deal
of
money
by
carrying
for
the
lahul
central
ladak
and
rudok
merchants
their
sheep
travelling
as
far
as
gar
in
chinese
tibet
they
are
paid
in
grain
as
well
as
coin
their
own
country
producing
no
farinaceous
food
they
have
only
two
uses
for
silver
money
with
part
of
their
gains
they
pay
the
tribute
to
kashmir
and
they
melt
the
rest
and
work
it
into
rude
personal
ornaments
according
to
an
old
arrangement
between
lhassa
and
leh
they
carry
brick
tea
free
for
the
lhassa
merchants
they
are
buddhists
and
practise
polyandry
but
their
young
men
do
not
become
and
owing
to
the
scarcity
of
fuel
instead
of
burning
their
dead
they
expose
them
with
religious
rites
face
upwards
in
desolate
places
to
be
made
away
with
by
the
birds
of
the
air
all
their
tents
have
a
on
which
are
placed
small
images
and
sacred
emblems
they
dress
as
the
ladakis
except
that
the
men
wear
shoes
with
very
high
points
and
that
the
women
in
addition
to
the
the
usual
ornament
place
on
the
top
of
the
head
a
large
silver
coronet
with
three
tassels
in
physiognomy
they
resemble
the
ladakis
but
the
mongolian
type
is
purer
the
eyes
are
more
oblique
and
the
eyelids
have
a
greater
droop
the
chins
project
more
and
the
mouths
are
handsomer
many
of
the
men
including
the
headman
were
quite
but
the
upper
lips
of
the
women
were
apt
to
be
up
displaying
very
square
teeth
as
we
have
shown
in
the
preceding
chapter
illustration
a
tibetan
the
roofs
of
the
tsala
tents
are
nearly
flat
and
the
middle
has
an
opening
six
inches
wide
along
its
whole
length
an
excavation
from
twelve
to
inches
deep
is
made
in
the
soil
and
a
rude
wall
of
stones
about
one
foot
high
is
built
round
it
over
which
the
tent
cloth
made
in
narrow
widths
of
or
goat
hair
is
extended
by
ropes
led
over
forked
sticks
there
is
no
ridge
pole
and
the
centre
is
supported
on
short
poles
to
the
projecting
tops
of
which
prayer
flags
and
tails
are
attached
the
interior
though
dark
is
not
too
dark
for
weaving
and
each
tent
has
its
loom
for
the
not
only
weave
their
coarse
woollen
clothing
and
hair
cloth
for
saddlebags
and
tents
but
rugs
of
wool
dyed
in
rich
colours
made
from
native
roots
the
largest
tent
was
twenty
feet
by
fifteen
but
the
majority
measured
only
fourteen
feet
by
eight
and
ten
feet
the
height
in
no
case
exceeded
six
feet
in
these
much
ventilated
and
scarcely
warmed
shelters
these
hardy
nomads
brave
the
tremendous
winds
and
winter
rigours
of
their
climate
at
altitudes
varying
from
to
feet
water
freezes
every
night
of
the
year
and
continually
there
are
differences
in
temperature
of
between
noon
and
midnight
in
addition
to
the
fifty
dwelling
tents
there
was
one
considerably
larger
in
which
the
people
store
their
wool
and
goat
hair
till
the
time
arrives
for
taking
them
to
market
the
floor
of
several
of
the
tents
was
covered
with
rugs
and
besides
looms
and
confused
heaps
of
what
looked
like
rubbish
there
were
goatskin
churns
sheep
and
goat
skins
children
bows
and
arrows
cooking
pots
and
heaps
of
the
furze
root
which
is
used
as
fuel
they
expended
much
of
this
scarce
commodity
upon
me
in
their
hospitality
and
kept
up
a
bonfire
all
night
they
mounted
their
wiry
ponies
and
performed
feats
of
horsemanship
in
one
of
which
all
the
animals
threw
themselves
on
their
hind
legs
in
a
circle
when
a
man
in
the
centre
clapped
his
hands
and
they
crowded
my
tent
to
see
my
sketches
and
were
not
satisfied
till
i
executed
some
daubs
professing
to
represent
some
of
the
elders
the
excitement
of
their
first
visit
from
a
european
woman
lasted
late
into
the
night
and
when
they
at
last
retired
they
persisted
in
placing
a
guard
of
honour
round
my
tent
in
the
morning
there
was
ice
on
the
pools
and
the
snow
lay
three
inches
deep
savage
life
had
returned
to
its
usual
monotony
and
the
care
of
flocks
and
herds
in
the
early
afternoon
the
chief
and
many
of
the
men
accompanied
us
across
the
ford
and
we
parted
with
mutual
expressions
of
good
will
the
march
was
through
broad
gravelly
valleys
among
protuberances
of
red
and
yellow
gravel
elevated
by
their
height
alone
to
the
dignity
of
mountains
hail
came
on
and
gyalpo
showed
his
high
breeding
by
facing
it
when
the
other
animals
tail
and
huddled
together
and
a
storm
of
heavy
sleet
of
some
duration
burst
upon
us
just
as
we
reached
the
dismal
of
rukchen
guarded
by
mountain
giants
which
now
and
then
showed
glimpses
of
their
white
skirts
through
the
dark
driving
mists
that
was
the
only
in
four
months
a
large
caravan
from
the
heat
and
sunshine
of
amritsar
was
there
the
goods
were
stacked
under
goat
hair
shelters
the
mules
were
huddled
together
without
food
and
their
shivering
panjābi
drivers
muffled
in
blankets
which
only
left
one
eye
exposed
were
grubbing
up
furze
roots
wherewith
to
make
smoky
fires
my
baggage
which
had
arrived
previously
was
lying
soaking
in
the
sleet
while
the
wretched
servants
were
trying
to
pitch
the
tent
in
the
high
wind
they
had
slept
out
in
the
snow
the
night
before
and
were
mentally
as
well
as
physically
benumbed
their
misery
had
a
comic
side
to
it
and
as
the
temperature
made
me
feel
specially
well
i
enjoyed
bestirring
myself
and
terrified
mando
who
was
feebly
with
a
rag
by
giving
gyalpo
a
vigorous
with
a
hassan
khan
with
chattering
teeth
and
severe
neuralgia
muffled
in
my
hood
under
his
turban
was
trying
to
do
his
work
with
his
unfailing
pluck
mando
was
shedding
futile
tears
over
wet
furze
which
would
not
light
the
small
wet
corrie
was
dotted
over
with
the
amritsar
men
sheltering
under
rocks
and
nursing
hopeless
fires
and
fifty
mules
and
horses
with
dejected
heads
and
dripping
tails
and
their
backs
to
the
merciless
wind
were
attempting
to
pick
some
food
from
scanty
herbage
already
nibbled
to
the
root
my
tent
was
a
picture
of
grotesque
discomfort
the
big
stones
had
not
been
picked
out
from
the
gravel
the
bed
stood
in
puddles
the
thick
horse
blanket
was
draining
over
the
one
chair
the
servant
spare
clothing
and
stores
were
on
the
table
the
loads
of
wet
hay
and
the
soaked
grain
sack
filled
up
most
of
the
space
a
wet
candle
sputtered
and
went
out
wet
clothes
dripped
from
the
tent
hook
and
every
now
and
then
hassan
khan
looked
in
with
one
eye
gasping
out
sahib
i
can
no
light
the
fire
perseverance
succeeds
eventually
and
cups
of
a
strong
stimulant
made
of
burroughes
and
wellcome
vigorous
tincture
of
ginger
and
hot
water
revived
the
men
all
round
such
was
its
good
but
innocent
effect
that
early
the
next
morning
hassan
came
into
my
tent
with
two
eyes
and
convulsed
with
laughter
pony
men
and
mando
he
said
were
crying
and
the
coolie
from
leh
who
before
the
storm
had
wanted
to
go
the
whole
way
to
simla
after
refusing
his
supper
had
sobbed
all
night
under
the
of
my
tent
while
i
was
sleeping
soundly
afterwards
i
harangued
them
and
told
them
i
would
let
them
go
and
help
them
back
i
could
not
take
such
miserable
creatures
with
me
and
i
would
keep
the
tartars
who
had
accompanied
me
from
tsala
on
this
they
protested
and
said
with
a
significant
gesture
i
might
cut
their
throats
if
they
cried
any
more
and
begged
me
to
try
them
again
and
as
we
had
no
more
bad
weather
there
was
no
more
trouble
the
marches
which
followed
were
along
valleys
plains
and
of
gravel
destitute
of
herbage
except
a
shrivelled
artemisia
and
on
one
occasion
the
baggage
animals
were
forty
hours
without
food
fresh
water
was
usually
very
scarce
and
on
the
lingti
plains
was
only
obtainable
by
scooping
it
up
from
the
holes
left
by
the
feet
of
animals
insect
life
was
rare
and
except
grey
doves
the
of
the
valleys
which
often
flew
before
us
for
miles
down
the
ravines
no
birds
were
to
be
seen
on
the
other
hand
there
were
numerous
herds
of
which
in
the
early
mornings
came
to
drink
of
the
water
by
which
the
camps
were
pitched
by
looking
through
a
crevice
of
my
tent
i
saw
them
distinctly
without
alarming
them
in
one
herd
i
counted
forty

kept
together
in
families
sire
dam
and
foal
the
animal
certainly
is
under
fourteen
hands
and
resembles
a
mule
rather
than
a
horse
or
ass
the
noise
which
i
had
several
opportunities
of
hearing
is
more
like
a
neigh
than
a
bray
but
lacks
completeness
the
creature
is
light
brown
almost
fawn
colour
fading
into
white
under
his
body
and
he
has
a
dark
stripe
on
his
back
but
not
a
cross
his
ears
are
long
and
his
tail
is
like
that
of
a
mule
he
trots
and
gallops
and
when
alarmed
gallops
fast
but
as
he
is
not
worth
hunting
he
has
not
a
great
dread
of
humanity
and
families
of
frequently
grazed
within
two
hundred
and
fifty
yards
of
us
he
is
about
as
untamable
as
the
zebra
and
with
his
family
affectionateness
leads
apparently
a
very
happy
life

on

with

among

sheep
each
animal
with

loaded
with
from

pounds
of

these
and
many
more
which
we
passed
were
carrying
their
loads
to

a
mountain

in

where
they
are
met
by
traders
from

the

are
shorn

the

are
exchanged
for
wheat
and
a

other
commodities
with
which
they
return
to

the
whole
journey
taking
from
nine
months
to
a
year
as
the
sheep
live
by
grazing

scanty
herbage

never

nights

walked
round
their
orderly
lines
of

and
their
neat
walls
of
saddlebags
and
far
from
showing
any
discourtesy
or
rude
curiosity
they
held
down
their
fierce
dogs

exhibited
their
ingenious
mode

tethering

across

the
crossing
of

several

three
lofty

the
gorge
to

chasm
guarded
by
nearly
perpendicular
needles
of
rock

in
the
westering
sun
we
forded
the
river
at
the
throat
and
camped
on
a
velvety
green
lawn
just
large
enough
for
a
few

absolutely
walled
in
by
abrupt
mountains
and
feet
in

after
the
twilight
settled
down
on
us

pinnacles
above
glowed
in
warm
sunshine
and
the
following

it
was

us
to
the

the
romance

sent
all
back

my
servants
looking
much
crestfallen
we
crossed
the
baralacha
pass
in
wind
and
snow

into
a
climate

began
to
be
obvious

short
distances

crouch

my
men
suffered
far
more
than
on
the
two
higher
passes
and
it
was
difficult
to
dislodge
them
from
these
shelters
where
they
lay
groaning
gasping
and
suffering
from
vertigo
and
the
cold
was
so
severe
that
i
walked
over
the
loftiest
part
of
the

for
the
first
time
felt
slight
effects
of

in

the

exchange
their

was
covered
with

practically
for

of

for

catch
the

rains
which
at

are

while
on
the

the

is

to

invited
me
to
his

three
days
journey
these
were
the
first
human
beings
we
had
seen
for
three
days
a
few
miles
south
of
the
baralacha
pass
some
birch
trees
appeared
on
a
slope
the
first
natural
growth
of
timber
that
i
had
seen
since
crossing
the
zoji

lower
down
there
were
a
few
more
then
stunted
specimens
of
the
pencil

and
the
mountains
began
to
show
a
shade
of
green
on
their
lower
slopes
butterflies
appeared
also
and
a
vulture
a
grand
bird
on
the
wing
hovered
ominously
over
us
for
some
miles
and
was
succeeded
by
an
equally
ominous
raven
on
the
excellent
cut
on
the
face
of
the
precipices
which
overhang
the
bhaga

is
in
nine

the

the

went
by

him
in

magnificently
situated

on

nearly
on

on

it
only
differs
from

blue
glass

in

temple
in

was
a

reminded
me

zinnias
dianthus
and
petunias
all
of
immense

in

i
camped
for

willow
tree
covered
as
many
are
with
a
sweet
secretion
so
abundant
as
to
drop

which
the
people
collect
and
use
as
honey
the
mission
party
consisted
of
and
shreve
lately
arrived
and
now
in
a
distant
exile
at
poo
and
and
heyde
who
had
been
in
tibet
for
nearly
forty
years
chiefly
spent
at
kylang
without
going
home
living
and
high
thinking
were
the
rule
books
and
periodicals
were
numerous
and
were
read
and
assimilated
the
culture
was
simply
wonderful
and
the
acquaintance
with
the
latest
ideas
in
theology
and
natural
science
the
latest
political
and
social
developments
and
the
latest
conceptions
in
european
art
would
have
led
me
to
suppose
that
these
admirable
people
had
only
just
left
europe
heyde
had
no
servant
and
in
the
long
winters
when
household
and
mission
work
are
over
for
the
day
and
there
are
no
mails
to
write
for
she
pursues
her
tailoring
and
other
needlework
while
her
husband
reads
aloud
till
midnight
at
the
time
of
my
visit
september
busy
preparations
for
the
winter
were
being
made
every
day
the
wood
piles
grew
hay
cut
with
sickles
on
the
steep
hillsides
was
carried
on
human
backs
into
the
farmyard
apples
were
cored
and
dried
in
the
sun
cucumbers
were
pickled
vinegar
was
made
potatoes
were
stored
and
meat
was
killed
and
salted
it
is
in
winter
when
the
christians
have
come
down
from
the
mountain
that
most
of
the
mission
work
is
done
heyde
has
a
school
of
forty
girls
mostly
buddhists
the
teaching
is
simple
and
practical
and
includes
the
knitting
of
socks
of
which
from
four
to
five
hundred
pairs
are
turned
out
each
winter
and
find
a
ready
sale
the
converts
meet
for
instruction
and
discussion
twice
daily
and
there
is
daily
worship
the
mission
press
is
kept
actively
employed
in
printing
the
parts
of
the
bible
which
have
been
translated
during
the
summer
as
well
as
simple
tracts
written
or
translated
by
heyde
no
converts
are
better
instructed
and
like
those
of
leh
they
seem
of
good
quality
and
are
industrious
and
winter
work
is
severe
as
ponies
cattle
and
sheep
must
always
be
and
often
heyde
has
great
repute
as
a
doctor
and
in
summer
people
travel
long
distances
for
his
advice
and
medicine
he
is
universally
respected
and
his
judgment
in
worldly
affairs
is
highly
thought
of
but
if
one
were
to
judge
merely
by
apparent
results
the
devoted
labour
of
nearly
forty
years
and
complete
for
the
good
of
kylang
must
be
pronounced
unsuccessful
christianity
has
been
most
strongly
opposed
by
men
of
influence
and
converts
have
been
exposed
to
persecution
and
loss
the
abbot
of
the
kylang
monastery
lately
said
to
heyde
christian
teaching
has
given
buddhism
a
resurrection
the
actual
words
used
were
you
came
here
people
were
quite
indifferent
about
their
religion
but
since
it
has
been
attacked
they
have
become
zealous
and
now
they
it
is
only
by
sharing
their
circumstances
of
isolation
and
by
getting
glimpses
of
their
everyday
life
and
work
that
one
can
realise
at
all
what
the
heroic
perseverance
and
toil
of
these
forty
years
have
been
and
what
is
the
weighty
influence
on
the
people
and
on
the
standard
of
morals
even
though
the
number
of
converts
is
so
small
all
honour
to
these
noble
german
missionaries
learned
genial
cultured
radiant
who
whether
teaching
preaching
farming
gardening

or
doctoring
are
always
and
everywhere

is

where
many
children
of
the
mission
families
sleep
and
a
few
adults
as
the
winter
is
the
busiest
season
in
mission
work
so
it
is
the
great
time
in
which
the
make
peregrinations
and
attend
at
festivals
then
also
there
is
much
spinning
and
weaving
by
both
sexes
and
tobogganing
and
other
games
and
much
drinking
of
by
priests
and
people
the
cattle
remain
out
till
nearly
christmas
and
are
then
taken
into
the
houses
at
the
time
of
the
variable
new
year
the
and
nuns
retire
to
the
monasteries
and
dulness
reigns
in
the
valleys
at
the
end
of
a
month
they
emerge
life
and
noise
begin
and
all
men
to
whom
sons
have
been
born
during
the
previous
year
give
freely
during
the
festival
which
follows
all
these
jubilant
fathers
go
out
of
the
village
as
a
gaudily
dressed
procession
and
form
a
circle
round
a
picture
of
a
painted
by
the
which
is
used
as
a
target
to
be
shot
at
with
bows
and
arrows
and
it
is
believed
that
the
man
who
hits
it
in
the
centre
will
be
blessed
with
a
son
in
the
coming
year
after
this
all
the
kylang
men
and
women
collect
in
one
house
by
annual
rotation
and
sing
and
drink
immense
quantities
of
till
the
religious
festivals
begin
soon
after
one
the
worshipping
of
the
by
the
laity
occurs
in
every
village
and
lasts
from
two
to
three
days
it
consists
chiefly
of
music
and
dancing
while
the
sit
in
rows
swilling
and
arrack
at
another
which
is
celebrated
annually
in
every
house
the
assemble
and
in
front
of
certain
gods
prepare
a
number
of
mystical
figures
made
of
dough
which
are
hung
up
and
are
worshipped
by
the
family
afterwards
the
make
little
balls
which
are
worshipped
and
one
of
the
family
mounts
the
roof
and
invites
the
neighbours
who
receive
the
balls
from
the
hands
and
drink
moderately
of
next
the
figures
are
thrown
to
the
demons
as
a
propitiatory
offering
amidst
whistlings
and
the
firing
of
guns
these
ceremonies
are
called
a
full
life
and
it
is
believed
that
if
they
were
neglected
life
would
be
cut
short
one
of
the
most
important
of
the
winter
religious
duties
of
the
is
the
reading
of
the
sacred
classics
under
the
roof
of
each
householder
by
this
means
the
family
accumulate
merit
and
the
longer
the
reading
is
protracted
the
greater
is
the
accumulation
a
book
is
taken
in
the
houses
of
the
richer
householders
each
one
of
the
twelve
or
fifteen
taking
a
page
all
reading
at
an
immense
pace
in
a
loud
chant
at
the
same
time
the
reading
of
these
volumes
which
consist
of
buddhist
metaphysics
and
philosophy
takes
five
days
and
while
reading
each
has
his
cup
constantly
replenished
in
the
poorer
households
a
classic
of
but
one
volume
is
taken
to
lessen
the
expense
of
feeding
the
festivals
and
ceremonies
follow
each
other
closely
until
march
when
archery
practice
begins
and
in
april
and
may
the
people
prepare
for
the
operations
of
husbandry
the
weather
in
kylang
breaks
in
the
middle
of
september
but
so
fascinating
were
the
beauties
and
sublimity
of
nature
and
the
virtues
and
culture
of
my
moravian
friends
that
shutting
my
eyes
to
the
possible
perils
of
the
rotang
i
remained
until
the
harvest
was
brought
home
with
joy
and
revelry
and
the
flush
of
autumn
faded
and
the
first
snows
of
winter
gave
an
added
majesty
to
the
glorious
valley
then
reluctantly
folding
my
tent
and
taking
the
same
faithful
fellows
who
brought
my
baggage
from
leh
i
spent
five
weeks
on
the
descent
to
the
panjāb
journeying
through
the
paradise
of
upper
kulu
and
the
interesting
native
states
of
mandi
sukket
bilaspur

early
in

reached
the
amenities

restraints
of
the
civilisation
