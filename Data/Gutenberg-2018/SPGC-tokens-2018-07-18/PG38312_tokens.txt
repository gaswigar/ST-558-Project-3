the
mansion
there
was
an
air
of
calm
and
reserved
opulence
about
the
weightman
mansion
that
spoke
not
of
money
squandered
but
of
wealth
prudently
applied
standing
on
a
corner
of
the
avenue
no
longer
fashionable
for
residence
it
looked
upon
the
swelling
tide
of
business
with
an
expression
of
complacency
and
the
house
was
not
beautiful
there
was
nothing
in
its
straight
front
of
stone
its
heavy
cornices
its
broad
staring
windows
of
plate
glass
its
carved
and
mahogany
doors
at
the
top
of
the
wide
stoop
to
charm
the
eye
or
fascinate
the
imagination
but
it
was
eminently
respectable
and
in
its
way
imposing
it
seemed
to
say
that
the
glittering
shops
of
the
jewelers
the
milliners
the
confectioners
the
florists
the
the
furriers
the
makers
of
rare
and
costly
antiquities
retail
traders
in
luxuries
of
life
were
beneath
the
notice
of
a
house
that
had
its
foundations
in
the
high
finance
and
was
built
literally
and
figuratively
in
the
shadow
of
petronius
church
at
the
same
time
there
was
something
and
congratulatory
in
the
way
in
which
the
mansion
held
its
own
amid
the
changing
neighborhood
it
almost
seemed
to
be
lifted
up
a
little
among
the
tall
buildings
near
at
hand
as
if
it
felt
the
rising
value
of
the
land
on
which
it
stood
john
weightman
was
like
the
house
into
which
he
had
built
himself
thirty
years
ago
and
in
which
his
ideals
and
ambitions
were
incrusted
he
was
a
man
but
in
making
himself
he
had
chosen
a
highly
esteemed
pattern
and
worked
according
to
the
approved
rules
there
was
nothing
irregular
questionable
flamboyant
about
him
he
was
solid
correct
and
justly
successful
his
minor
tastes
of
course
had
been
carefully
kept
up
to
date
at
the
proper
time
pictures
by
the
barbizon
masters
old
english
plate
and
portraits
bronzes
by
barye
and
marbles
by
rodin
persian
carpets
and
chinese
porcelains
had
been
introduced
to
the
mansion
it
contained
a
louis
quinze
an
empire
a
jacobean
and
various
apartments
dimly
reminiscent
of
the
styles
of
furniture
affected
by
deceased
monarchs
that
the
hallways
were
too
short
for
the
historic
perspective
did
not
make
much
difference
american
decorative
art
is
de
it
absorbs
all
periods
of
each
period
weightman
wished
to
have
something
of
the
best
he
understood
its
value
present
as
a
certificate
and
prospective
as
an
investment
it
was
only
in
the
architecture
of
his
town
house
that
he
remained
conservative
immovable
one
might
almost
say
his
country
house
at
was
a
palace
of
the
italian
renaissance
but
in
town
he
adhered
to
an
architecture
which
had
moral
associations
the
epoch
it
was
a
symbol
of
his
social
position
his
religious
doctrine
and
even
in
a
way
of
his
business
creed
a
man
of
fixed
principles
he
would
say
should
express
them
in
the
looks
of
his
house
new
york
changes
its
domestic
architecture
too
rapidly
it
is
like
divorce
it
is
not
dignified
i
do
like
it
extravagance
and
fickleness
are
advertised
in
most
of
these
new
houses
i
wish
to
be
known
for
different
qualities
dignity
and
prudence
are
the
things
that
people
trust
every
one
knows
that
i
can
afford
to
live
in
the
house
that
suits
me
it
is
a
guarantee
to
the
public
it
inspires
confidence
it
helps
my
influence
there
is
a
text
in
the
bible
about
house
that
hath
foundations
that
is
the
proper
kind
of
a
mansion
for
a
solid
man
harold
weightman
had
often
listened
to
his
father
discoursing
in
this
fashion
on
the
fundamental
principles
of
life
and
always
with
a
divided
mind
he
admired
immensely
his
father
talents
and
the
energy
with
which
he
improved
them
but
in
the
paternal
philosophy
there
was
something
that
disquieted
and
oppressed
the
young
man
and
made
him
gasp
inwardly
for
fresh
air
and
free
action
at
times
during
his
college
course
and
his
years
at
the
law
school
he
had
yielded
to
this
impulse
and
broken
away
now
toward
extravagance
and
dissipation
and
then
when
the
reaction
came
toward
a
romantic
devotion
to
work
among
the
poor
he
had
felt
his
disapproval
for
both
of
these
forms
of
imprudence
but
it
was
never
expressed
in
a
harsh
or
violent
way
always
with
a
certain
tolerant
patience
such
as
one
might
show
for
the
mistakes
and
vagaries
of
the
very
young
john
weightman
was
not
hasty
impulsive
inconsiderate
even
toward
his
own
children
with
them
as
with
the
rest
of
the
world
he
felt
that
he
had
a
reputation
to
maintain
a
theory
to
vindicate
he
could
afford
to
give
them
time
to
see
that
he
was
absolutely
right
one
of
his
favorite
scripture
quotations
was
wait
on
the
lord
he
had
applied
it
to
real
estate
and
to
people
with
profitable
results
but
to
human
persons
the
sensation
of
being
waited
for
is
not
always
agreeable
sometimes
especially
with
the
young
it
produces
a
vague
restlessness
a
dumb
resentment
which
is
increased
by
the
fact
that
one
can
hardly
explain
or
justify
it
of
this
john
weightman
was
not
conscious
it
lay
beyond
his
horizon
he
did
not
take
it
into
account
in
the
plan
of
life
which
he
made
for
himself
and
for
his
family
as
the
sharers
and
inheritors
of
his
success
father
plays
us
said
harold
in
a
moment
of
irritation
to
his
mother
like
pieces
in
a
game
of
chess
my
dear
said
that
lady
whose
faith
in
her
husband
was
religious
you
ought
not
to
speak
so
impatiently
at
least
he
wins
the
game
he
is
one
of
the
most
respected
men
in
new
york
and
he
is
very
generous
too
i
wish
he
would
be
more
generous
in
letting
us
be
ourselves
said
the
young
man
he
always
has
something
in
view
for
us
and
expects
to
move
us
up
to
it
but
is
it
always
for
our
benefit
replied
his
mother
look
what
a
position
we
have
no
one
can
say
there
is
any
taint
on
our
money
there
are
no
rumors
about
your
father
he
has
kept
the
laws
of
god
and
of
man
he
has
never
made
any
mistakes
harold
got
up
from
his
chair
and
poked
the
fire
then
he
came
back
to
the
ample
lady
and
sat
beside
her
on
the
sofa
he
took
her
hand
gently
and
looked
at
the
two
rings
a
thin
band
of
yellow
gold
and
a
small
solitaire
diamond
which
kept
their
place
on
her
third
finger
in
modest
dignity
as
if
not
shamed
but
rather
justified
by
the
splendor
of
the
emerald
which
glittered
beside
them
mother
he
said
you
have
a
wonderful
hand
and
father
made
no
mistake
when
he
won
you
but
are
you
sure
he
has
always
been
so
inerrant
harold
she
exclaimed
a
little
stiffly
what
do
you
mean
his
life
is
an
open
book
oh
he
answered
i
do
mean
anything
bad
mother
dear
i
know
the
governor
life
is
an
open
book
a
ledger
if
you
like
kept
in
the
best
bookkeeping
hand
and
always
ready
for
inspection
every
page
correct
and
showing
a
handsome
balance
but
is
it
a
mistake
not
to
allow
us
to
make
our
own
mistakes
to
learn
for
ourselves
to
live
our
own
lives
must
we
be
always
working
for
balance
in
one
thing
or
another
i
want
to
be
myself
to
get
outside
of
this
everlasting
profitable
to
let
myself
go
and
lose
myself
for
a
while
at
least
to
do
the
things
that
i
want
to
do
just
because
i
want
to
do
them
my
boy
said
his
mother
anxiously
you
are
not
going
to
do
anything
wrong
or
foolish
you
know
the
falsehood
of
that
old
proverb
about
wild
oats
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
yes
mother
he
answered
i
know
it
well
enough
but
in
california
you
know
the
wild
oats
are
one
of
the
most
valuable
crops
they
grow
all
over
the
hillsides
and
keep
the
cattle
and
the
horses
alive
but
that
was
what
i
meant
to
sow
wild
oats
say
to
pick
wild
flowers
if
you
like
or
even
to
chase
wild
geese
to
do
something
that
seems
good
to
me
just
for
its
own
sake
not
for
the
sake
of
wages
of
one
kind
or
another
i
feel
like
a
hired
man
in
the
service
of
this
magnificent
mansion
say
in
training
for
father
place
as
majordomo
i
like
to
get
out
some
way
to
feel
free
perhaps
to
do
something
for
others
the
young
man
voice
hesitated
a
little
yes
it
sounds
like
cant
i
know
but
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
i
like
to
do
some
good
in
the
world
if
father
only
would
insist
upon
god
putting
it
into
the
ledger
his
mother
moved
uneasily
and
a
slight
look
of
bewilderment
came
into
her
face
is
that
almost
irreverent
she
asked
surely
the
righteous
must
have
their
reward
and
your
father
is
good
see
how
much
he
gives
to
all
the
established
charities
how
many
things
he
has
founded
always
thinking
of
others
and
planning
for
them
and
surely
for
us
he
does
everything
how
well
he
has
planned
this
trip
to
europe
for
me
and
the
girls
the
at
berlin
the
season
on
the
riviera
the
visits
in
england
with
the
plumptons
and
the
halverstones
he
says
lord
halverstone
has
the
finest
old
house
in
sussex
pure
elizabethan
and
all
the
old
customs
are
kept
up
too
family
prayers
every
morning
for
all
the
domestics
you
know
his
son
bertie
i
believe
harold
smiled
a
little
to
himself
as
he
answered
yes
i
fished
at
catalina
island
last
june
with
the
honorable
ethelbert
he
rather
a
decent
chap
in
spite
of
his
ingrowing
mind
but
you
mother
you
are
simply
magnificent
you
are
father
masterpiece
the
young
man
leaned
over
to
kiss
her
and
went
up
to
the
riding
club
for
his
afternoon
canter
in
the
park
so
it
came
to
pass
early
in
december
that
weightman
and
her
two
daughters
sailed
for
europe
on
their
serious
pleasure
trip
even
as
it
had
been
written
in
the
book
of
providence
and
john
weightman
who
had
made
the
entry
was
left
to
pass
the
rest
of
the
winter
with
his
son
and
heir
in
the
brownstone
mansion
they
were
comfortable
enough
the
machinery
of
the
massive
establishment
ran
as
smoothly
as
a
great
electric
dynamo
they
were
busy
enough
too
john
weightman
plans
and
enterprises
were
complicated
though
his
principle
of
action
was
always
simple
to
get
good
value
for
every
expenditure
and
effort
the
of
which
he
was
the
chief
the
brain
the
will
the
absolutely
controlling
hand
was
so
admirably
organized
that
the
details
of
its
direction
took
but
little
time
but
the
scores
of
other
interests
that
radiated
from
it
and
were
dependent
upon
it
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
contributed
to
its
solidity
and
success
the
many
investments
industrial
political
benevolent
reformatory
ecclesiastical
that
had
made
the
name
of
weightman
well
known
and
potent
in
city
church
and
state
demanded
much
attention
and
careful
steering
in
order
that
each
might
produce
the
desired
result
there
were
board
meetings
of
corporations
and
hospitals
conferences
in
wall
street
and
at
albany
consultations
and
committee
meetings
in
the
brownstone
mansion
for
a
share
in
all
this
business
and
its
adjuncts
john
weightman
had
his
son
in
training
in
one
of
the
famous
law
firms
of
the
city
for
he
held
that
banking
itself
is
a
simple
affair
the
only
real
difficulties
of
finance
are
on
its
legal
side
meantime
he
wished
the
young
man
to
meet
and
know
the
men
with
whom
he
would
have
to
deal
when
he
became
a
partner
in
the
house
so
a
couple
of
dinners
were
given
in
the
mansion
during
december
after
which
the
father
called
the
son
attention
to
the
fact
that
over
a
hundred
million
dollars
had
sat
around
the
board
but
on
christmas
eve
father
and
son
were
dining
together
without
guests
and
their
talk
across
the
broad
table
glittering
with
silver
and
cut
glass
and
softly
lit
by
shaded
candles
was
intimate
though
a
little
slow
at
times
the
elder
man
was
in
rather
a
rare
mood
more
expansive
and
confidential
than
usual
and
when
the
coffee
was
brought
in
and
they
were
left
alone
he
talked
more
freely
of
his
personal
plans
and
hopes
than
he
had
ever
done
before
i
feel
very
grateful
said
he
at
last
it
must
be
something
in
the
air
of
christmas
that
gives
me
this
feeling
of
thankfulness
for
the
many
divine
mercies
that
have
been
bestowed
upon
me
all
the
principles
by
which
i
have
tried
to
guide
my
life
have
been
justified
i
have
never
made
the
value
of
this
salted
almond
by
anything
that
the
courts
would
not
uphold
at
least
in
the
long
run
and
yet
or
would
it
be
truer
to
say
and
therefore
my
affairs
have
been
wonderfully
prospered
there
a
great
deal
in
that
text
is
the
best
but
no
that
not
from
the
bible
after
all
is
it
wait
a
moment
there
is
something
of
that
kind
i
know
may
i
light
a
cigar
father
said
harold
turning
away
to
hide
a
smile
while
you
are
remembering
the
text
yes
certainly
answered
the
elder
man
rather
shortly
you
know
i
do
dislike
the
smell
but
it
is
a
wasteful
useless
habit
and
therefore
i
have
never
practised
it
nothing
useless
is
worth
while
that
my
motto
nothing
that
does
not
bring
the
reward
oh
now
i
recall
the
text
i
say
unto
you
they
have
their
reward
i
shall
ask
doctor
snodgrass
to
preach
a
sermon
on
that
verse
some
day
using
you
as
an
illustration
well
not
exactly
that
but
i
could
give
him
some
good
material
from
my
own
experience
to
prove
the
truth
of
scripture
i
can
honestly
say
that
there
is
not
one
of
my
charities
that
has
not
brought
me
in
a
good
return
either
in
the
increase
of
influence
the
building
up
of
credit
or
the
association
with
substantial
people
of
course
you
have
to
be
careful
how
you
give
in
order
to
secure
the
best
results
no
indiscriminate
giving
no
pennies
in
beggars
hats
it
has
been
one
of
my
principles
always
to
use
the
same
kind
of
judgment
in
charities
that
i
use
in
my
other
affairs
and
they
have
not
disappointed
me
even
the
check
that
you
put
in
the
plate
when
you
take
the
offertory
up
the
aisle
on
sunday
morning
certainly
though
there
the
influence
is
less
direct
and
i
must
confess
that
i
have
my
doubts
in
regard
to
the
collection
for
foreign
missions
that
always
seems
to
me
romantic
and
wasteful
you
never
hear
from
it
in
any
definite
way
they
say
the
missionaries
have
done
a
good
deal
to
open
the
way
for
trade
perhaps
but
they
have
also
gotten
us
into
commercial
and
political
difficulties
yet
i
give
to
them
a
little
it
is
a
matter
of
conscience
with
me
to
identify
myself
with
all
the
enterprises
of
the
church
it
is
the
mainstay
of
social
order
and
a
prosperous
civilization
but
the
best
forms
of
benevolence
are
the
organized
ones
here
at
home
where
people
can
see
them
and
know
what
they
are
doing
you
mean
the
ones
that
have
a
local
habitation
and
a
name
yes
they
offer
by
far
the
safest
return
though
of
course
there
is
something
gained
by
contributing
to
general
funds
a
public
man
afford
to
be
without
public
spirit
but
on
the
whole
i
prefer
a
building
or
an
endowment
there
is
a
mutual
advantage
to
a
good
name
and
a
good
institution
in
their
connection
in
the
public
mind
it
helps
them
both
remember
that
my
boy
of
course
at
the
beginning
you
will
have
to
practise
it
in
a
small
way
later
you
will
have
larger
opportunities
but
try
to
put
your
gifts
where
they
can
be
identified
and
do
good
all
around
you
see
the
wisdom
of
it
in
the
long
run
i
can
see
it
already
sir
and
the
way
you
describe
it
looks
amazingly
wise
and
prudent
in
other
words
we
must
cast
our
bread
on
the
waters
in
large
loaves
carried
by
sound
ships
marked
with
the
owner
name
so
that
the
return
freight
will
be
sure
to
come
back
to
us
the
father
laughed
but
his
eyes
were
frowning
a
little
as
if
he
suspected
something
irreverent
under
the
respectful
reply
you
put
it
humorously
but
there
sense
in
what
you
say
why
not
god
rules
the
sea
but
he
expects
us
to
follow
the
laws
of
navigation
and
commerce
why
not
take
good
care
of
your
bread
even
when
you
give
it
away
it
not
for
me
to
say
why
not
and
yet
i
can
think
of
cases
the
young
man
hesitated
for
a
moment
his
cigar
had
gone
out
he
rose
and
tossed
it
into
the
fire
in
front
of
which
he
remained
standing
a
slender
eager
restless
young
figure
with
a
touch
of
hunger
in
the
fine
face
strangely
like
and
unlike
the
father
at
whom
he
looked
with
curiosity
the
fact
is
sir
he
continued
there
is
such
a
case
in
my
mind
now
and
it
is
a
good
deal
on
my
heart
too
so
i
thought
of
speaking
to
you
about
it
you
remember
tom
rollins
the
junior
who
was
so
good
to
me
when
i
entered
college
the
father
nodded
he
remembered
very
well
indeed
the
annoying
incidents
of
his
son
first
escapade
and
how
rollins
had
stood
by
him
and
helped
to
avoid
a
public
disgrace
and
how
a
close
friendship
had
grown
between
the
two
boys
so
different
in
their
fortunes
yes
he
said
i
remember
him
he
was
a
promising
young
man
has
he
succeeded
not
exactly
that
is
not
yet
his
business
has
been
going
rather
badly
he
has
a
wife
and
little
baby
you
know
and
now
he
has
broken
down
something
wrong
with
his
lungs
the
doctor
says
his
only
chance
is
a
year
or
eighteen
months
in
colorado
i
wish
we
could
help
him
how
much
would
it
cost
three
or
four
thousand
perhaps
as
a
loan
does
the
doctor
say
he
will
get
well
a
fighting
chance
the
doctor
says
the
face
of
the
older
man
changed
subtly
not
a
line
was
altered
but
it
seemed
to
have
a
different
substance
as
if
it
were
carved
out
of
some
firm
imperishable
stuff
a
fighting
chance
he
said
may
do
for
a
speculation
but
it
is
not
a
good
investment
you
owe
something
to
young
rollins
your
grateful
feeling
does
you
credit
but
do
overwork
it
send
him
three
or
four
hundred
if
you
like
you
never
hear
from
it
again
except
in
the
letter
of
thanks
but
for
heaven
sake
do
be
sentimental
religion
is
not
a
matter
of
sentiment
it
a
matter
of
principle
illustration
it
is
not
a
good
investment
the
face
of
the
younger
man
changed
now
but
instead
of
becoming
fixed
and
graven
it
seemed
to
melt
into
life
by
the
heat
of
an
inward
fire
his
nostrils
quivered
with
quick
breath
his
lips
were
curled
principle
he
said
you
mean
principal
and
interest
too
well
sir
you
know
best
whether
that
is
religion
or
not
but
if
it
is
count
me
out
please
tom
saved
me
from
going
to
the
devil
six
years
ago
and
i
be
damned
if
i
do
help
him
to
the
best
of
my
ability
now
john
weightman
looked
at
his
son
steadily
harold
he
said
at
last
you
know
i
dislike
violent
language
and
it
never
has
any
influence
with
me
if
i
could
honestly
approve
of
this
proposition
of
yours
let
you
have
the
money
but
i
ca
it
extravagant
and
useless
but
you
have
your
christmas
check
for
a
thousand
dollars
coming
to
you
you
can
use
it
as
you
please
i
never
interfere
with
your
private
affairs
thank
you
said
harold
thank
you
very
much
but
there
another
private
affair
i
want
to
get
away
from
this
life
this
town
this
house
it
stifles
me
you
refused
last
summer
when
i
asked
you
to
let
me
go
up
to
grenfell
mission
on
the
labrador
i
could
go
now
at
least
as
far
as
the
newfoundland
station
have
you
changed
your
mind
not
at
all
i
think
it
is
an
exceedingly
foolish
enterprise
it
would
interrupt
the
career
that
i
have
marked
out
for
you
well
then
here
a
cheaper
proposition
algy
vanderhoof
wants
me
to
join
him
on
his
yacht
with
well
with
a
little
party
to
cruise
in
the
west
indies
would
you
prefer
that
certainly
not
the
vanderhoof
set
is
wild
and
godless
i
do
not
wish
to
see
you
keeping
company
with
fools
who
walk
in
the
broad
and
easy
way
that
leads
to
perdition
it
is
rather
a
hard
choice
said
the
young
man
with
a
short
laugh
turning
toward
the
door
according
to
you
there
very
little
difference
a
fool
paradise
or
a
fool
hell
well
it
one
or
the
other
for
me
and
i
toss
up
for
it
heads
i
lose
tails
the
devil
wins
anyway
i
sick
of
this
and
i
out
of
it
harold
said
the
older
man
and
there
was
a
slight
tremor
in
his
voice
do
let
us
quarrel
on
christmas
eve
all
i
want
is
to
persuade
you
to
think
seriously
of
the
duties
and
responsibilities
to
which
god
has
called
you
do
speak
lightly
of
heaven
and
hell
remember
there
is
another
life
the
young
man
came
back
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
father
shoulder
father
he
said
i
want
to
remember
it
i
try
to
believe
in
it
but
somehow
or
other
in
this
house
it
all
seems
unreal
to
me
no
doubt
all
you
say
is
perfectly
right
and
wise
i
do
venture
to
argue
against
it
but
i
ca
feel
it
that
all
if
i
to
have
a
soul
either
to
lose
or
to
save
i
must
really
live
just
now
neither
the
present
nor
the
future
means
anything
to
me
but
surely
we
quarrel
i
very
grateful
to
you
and
we
part
friends
sir
the
father
held
out
his
hand
in
silence
the
heavy
portière
dropped
noiselessly
behind
the
son
and
he
went
up
the
wide
curving
stairway
to
his
own
room
meantime
john
weightman
sat
in
his
carved
chair
in
the
jacobean
he
felt
strangely
old
and
dull
the
portraits
of
beautiful
women
by
lawrence
and
reynolds
and
raeburn
which
had
often
seemed
like
real
company
to
him
looked
remote
and
uninteresting
he
fancied
something
cold
and
almost
unfriendly
in
their
expression
as
if
they
were
staring
through
him
or
beyond
him
they
cared
nothing
for
his
principles
his
hopes
his
disappointments
his
successes
they
belonged
to
another
world
in
which
he
had
no
place
at
this
he
felt
a
vague
resentment
a
sense
of
discomfort
that
he
could
not
have
defined
or
explained
he
was
used
to
being
considered
respected
appreciated
at
his
full
value
in
every
region
even
in
that
of
his
own
dreams
presently
he
rang
for
the
butler
telling
him
to
close
the
house
and
not
to
sit
up
and
walked
with
lagging
steps
into
the
long
library
where
the
shaded
lamps
were
burning
his
eye
fell
upon
the
low
shelves
full
of
costly
books
but
he
had
no
desire
to
open
them
even
the
carefully
chosen
pictures
that
hung
above
them
seemed
to
have
lost
their
attraction
he
paused
for
a
moment
before
an
idyll
of
corot
a
dance
of
nymphs
around
some
forgotten
altar
in
a
vaporous
glade
and
looked
at
it
curiously
there
was
something
rapturous
and
serene
about
the
picture
a
breath
of
in
the
misty
trees
a
harmony
of
joy
in
the
dancing
figures
that
wakened
in
him
a
feeling
of
and
it
represented
something
that
he
had
never
known
in
his
calculated
orderly
life
he
was
dimly
mistrustful
of
it
it
is
certainly
very
beautiful
he
thought
but
it
is
distinctly
pagan
that
altar
is
built
to
some
heathen
god
it
does
not
fit
into
the
scheme
of
a
christian
life
i
doubt
whether
it
is
consistent
with
the
tone
of
my
house
i
will
sell
it
this
winter
it
will
bring
three
or
four
times
what
i
paid
for
it
that
was
a
good
purchase
a
very
good
bargain
he
dropped
into
the
revolving
chair
before
his
big
library
table
it
was
covered
with
pamphlets
and
reports
of
the
various
enterprises
in
which
he
was
interested
there
was
a
pile
of
newspaper
clippings
in
which
his
name
was
mentioned
with
praise
for
his
sustaining
power
as
a
pillar
of
finance
for
his
judicious
benevolence
for
his
support
of
wise
and
prudent
reform
movements
for
his
discretion
in
making
permanent
public
gifts
the
weightman
charities
one
very
complaisant
editor
called
them
as
if
they
deserved
classification
as
a
distinct
species
he
turned
the
papers
over
listlessly
there
was
a
description
and
a
picture
of
the
weightman
wing
of
the
hospital
for
cripples
of
which
he
was
president
and
an
article
on
the
new
professor
in
the
weightman
chair
of
political
jurisprudence
in
jackson
university
of
which
he
was
a
trustee
and
an
illustrated
account
of
the
opening
of
the
weightman
at
where
he
had
his
legal
residence
for
purposes
of
taxation
this
last
was
perhaps
the
most
carefully
planned
of
all
the
weightman
charities
he
desired
to
win
the
confidence
and
support
of
his
rural
neighbors
it
had
pleased
him
much
when
the
local
newspaper
had
spoken
of
him
as
an
ideal
citizen
and
the
logical
candidate
for
the
governorship
of
the
state
but
upon
the
whole
it
seemed
to
him
wiser
to
keep
out
of
active
politics
it
would
be
easier
and
better
to
put
harold
into
the
running
to
have
him
sent
to
the
legislature
from
the
dulwich
district
then
to
the
national
house
then
to
the
senate
why
not
the
weightman
interests
were
large
enough
to
need
a
direct
representative
and
guardian
at
washington
but
all
these
plans
came
back
to
him
with
dust
upon
them
they
were
dry
and
crumbling
like
forsaken
habitations
the
son
upon
whom
his
complacent
ambition
had
rested
had
turned
his
back
upon
the
mansion
of
his
father
hopes
the
break
might
not
be
final
and
in
any
event
there
would
be
much
to
live
for
the
fortunes
of
the
family
would
be
secure
but
the
zest
of
it
all
would
be
gone
if
john
weightman
had
to
give
up
the
assurance
of
perpetuating
his
name
and
his
principles
in
his
son
it
was
a
bitter
disappointment
and
he
felt
that
he
had
not
deserved
it
he
rose
from
the
chair
and
paced
the
room
with
leaden
feet
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
his
age
was
visibly
upon
him
his
head
was
heavy
and
hot
and
the
thoughts
that
rolled
in
it
were
confused
and
depressing
could
it
be
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
the
principles
of
his
existence
there
was
no
argument
in
what
harold
had
said
it
was
almost
childish
and
yet
it
had
shaken
the
elder
man
more
deeply
than
he
cared
to
show
it
held
a
silent
attack
which
touched
him
more
than
open
criticism
suppose
the
end
of
his
life
were
nearer
than
he
thought
the
end
must
come
some
time
what
if
it
were
now
had
he
not
founded
his
house
upon
a
rock
had
he
not
kept
the
commandments
was
he
not
touching
the
law
blameless
and
beyond
this
even
if
there
were
some
faults
in
his
character
and
all
men
are
sinners
yet
he
surely
believed
in
the
saving
doctrines
of
religion
the
forgiveness
of
sins
the
resurrection
of
the
body
the
life
everlasting
yes
that
was
the
true
source
of
comfort
after
all
he
would
read
a
bit
in
the
bible
as
he
did
every
night
and
go
to
bed
and
to
sleep
he
went
back
to
his
chair
at
the
library
table
a
strange
weight
of
weariness
rested
upon
him
but
he
opened
the
book
at
a
familiar
place
and
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
verse
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
not
up
for
yourselves
treasures
upon
that
had
been
the
text
of
the
sermon
a
few
weeks
before
sleepily
heavily
he
tried
to
fix
his
mind
upon
it
and
recall
it
what
was
it
that
doctor
snodgrass
had
said
ah
yes
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
pause
here
in
reading
the
verse
we
must
read
on
without
a
pause
not
up
treasures
upon
earth
where
moth
and
rust
do
corrupt
and
where
thieves
break
through
and
that
was
the
true
doctrine
we
may
have
treasures
upon
earth
but
they
must
not
be
put
into
unsafe
places
but
into
safe
places
a
most
comforting
doctrine
he
had
always
followed
it
moths
and
rust
and
thieves
had
done
no
harm
to
his
investments
john
weightman
drooping
eyes
turned
to
the
next
verse
at
the
top
of
the
second
column
lay
up
for
yourselves
treasures
in
now
what
had
the
doctor
said
about
that
how
was
it
to
be
understood
in
what
sense
treasures
in
heaven
the
book
seemed
to
float
away
from
him
the
light
vanished
he
wondered
dimly
if
this
could
be
death
coming
so
suddenly
so
quietly
so
irresistibly
he
struggled
for
a
moment
to
hold
himself
up
and
then
sank
slowly
forward
upon
the
table
his
head
rested
upon
his
folded
hands
he
slipped
into
the
unknown
how
long
afterward
conscious
life
returned
to
him
he
did
not
know
the
blank
might
have
been
an
hour
or
a
century
he
knew
only
that
something
had
happened
in
the
interval
what
it
was
he
could
not
tell
he
found
great
difficulty
in
catching
the
thread
of
his
identity
again
he
felt
that
he
was
himself
but
the
trouble
was
to
make
his
connections
to
verify
and
place
himself
to
know
who
and
where
he
was
at
last
it
grew
clear
john
weightman
was
sitting
on
a
stone
not
far
from
a
road
in
a
strange
land
the
road
was
not
a
formal
highway
fenced
and
graded
it
was
more
like
a
great
worn
by
thousands
of
feet
passing
across
the
open
country
in
the
same
direction
down
in
the
valley
into
which
he
could
look
the
road
seemed
to
form
itself
gradually
out
of
many
minor
paths
little
footways
coming
across
the
meadows
winding
tracks
following
along
beside
the
streams
faintly
marked
trails
emerging
from
the
woodlands
but
on
the
hillside
the
threads
were
more
firmly
woven
into
one
clear
band
of
travel
though
there
were
still
a
few
dim
paths
joining
it
here
and
there
as
if
persons
had
been
climbing
up
the
hill
by
other
ways
and
had
turned
at
last
to
seek
the
road
from
the
edge
of
the
hill
where
john
weightman
sat
he
could
see
the
travelers
in
little
groups
or
larger
companies
gathering
from
time
to
time
by
the
different
paths
and
making
the
ascent
they
were
all
clothed
in
white
and
the
form
of
their
garments
was
strange
to
him
it
was
like
some
old
picture
they
passed
him
group
after
group
talking
quietly
together
or
singing
not
moving
in
haste
but
with
a
certain
air
of
eagerness
and
joy
as
if
they
were
glad
to
be
on
their
way
to
an
appointed
place
they
did
not
stay
to
speak
to
him
but
they
looked
at
him
often
and
spoke
to
one
another
as
they
looked
and
now
and
then
one
of
them
would
smile
and
beckon
him
a
friendly
greeting
so
that
he
felt
they
would
like
him
to
be
with
them
there
was
quite
an
interval
between
the
groups
and
he
followed
each
of
them
with
his
eyes
after
it
had
passed
blanching
the
long
ribbon
of
the
road
for
a
little
transient
space
rising
and
receding
across
the
wide
billowy
upland
among
the
rounded
hillocks
of
aerial
green
and
gold
and
lilac
until
it
came
to
the
high
horizon
and
stood
outlined
for
a
moment
a
tiny
cloud
of
whiteness
against
the
tender
blue
before
it
vanished
over
the
hill
for
a
long
time
he
sat
there
watching
and
wondering
it
was
a
very
different
world
from
that
in
which
his
mansion
on
the
avenue
was
built
and
it
looked
strange
to
him
but
most
real
as
real
as
anything
he
had
ever
seen
presently
he
felt
a
strong
desire
to
know
what
country
it
was
and
where
the
people
were
going
he
had
a
faint
premonition
of
what
it
must
be
but
he
wished
to
be
sure
so
he
rose
from
the
stone
where
he
was
sitting
and
came
down
through
the
short
grass
and
the
lavender
flowers
toward
a
passing
group
of
people
one
of
them
turned
to
meet
him
and
held
out
his
hand
it
was
an
old
man
under
whose
white
beard
and
brows
john
weightman
thought
he
saw
a
suggestion
of
the
face
of
the
village
doctor
who
had
cared
for
him
years
ago
when
he
was
a
boy
in
the
country
illustration
welcome
will
you
come
with
us
welcome
said
the
old
man
will
you
come
with
us
where
are
you
going
to
the
heavenly
city
to
see
our
mansions
there
and
who
are
these
with
you
strangers
to
me
until
a
little
while
ago
i
know
them
better
now
but
you
i
have
known
for
a
long
time
john
weightman
do
you
remember
your
old
doctor
yes
he
cried
yes
your
voice
has
not
changed
at
all
i
glad
indeed
to
see
you
doctor
mclean
especially
now
all
this
seems
very
strange
to
me
almost
oppressive
i
wonder
if
but
may
i
go
with
you
do
you
suppose
surely
answered
the
doctor
with
his
familiar
smile
it
will
do
you
good
and
you
also
must
have
a
mansion
in
the
city
waiting
for
you
a
fine
one
too
are
you
not
looking
forward
to
it
yes
replied
the
other
hesitating
a
moment
yes
i
believe
it
must
be
so
although
i
had
not
expected
to
see
it
so
soon
but
i
will
go
with
you
and
we
can
talk
by
the
way
the
two
men
quickly
caught
up
with
the
other
people
and
all
went
forward
together
along
the
road
the
doctor
had
little
to
tell
of
his
experience
for
it
had
been
a
plain
hard
life
uneventfully
spent
for
others
and
the
story
of
the
village
was
very
simple
john
adventures
and
triumphs
would
have
made
a
far
richer
more
imposing
history
full
of
contacts
with
the
great
events
and
personages
of
the
time
but
somehow
or
other
he
did
not
care
to
speak
much
about
it
walking
on
that
wide
heavenly
moorland
under
that
tranquil
sunless
arch
of
blue
in
that
free
air
of
perfect
peace
where
the
light
was
diffused
without
a
shadow
as
if
the
spirit
of
life
in
all
things
were
luminous
there
was
only
one
person
besides
the
doctor
in
that
little
company
whom
john
weightman
had
known
before
an
old
bookkeeper
who
had
spent
his
life
over
a
desk
carefully
keeping
accounts
a
rusty
dull
little
man
patient
and
narrow
whose
wife
had
been
in
the
insane
asylum
for
twenty
years
and
whose
only
child
was
a
crippled
daughter
for
whose
comfort
and
happiness
he
had
toiled
and
sacrificed
himself
without
stint
it
was
a
surprise
to
find
him
here
as
and
joyful
as
the
rest
illustration
that
free
air
of
perfect
peace
the
lives
of
others
in
the
company
were
revealed
in
brief
glimpses
as
they
talked
together
a
mother
early
widowed
who
had
kept
her
little
flock
of
children
together
and
labored
through
hard
and
heavy
years
to
bring
them
up
in
purity
and
knowledge
a
sister
of
charity
who
had
devoted
herself
to
the
nursing
of
poor
folk
who
were
being
eaten
to
death
by
cancer
a
schoolmaster
whose
heart
and
life
had
been
poured
into
his
quiet
work
of
training
boys
for
a
clean
and
thoughtful
manhood
a
medical
missionary
who
had
given
up
a
brilliant
career
in
science
to
take
the
charge
of
a
hospital
in
darkest
africa
a
beautiful
woman
with
silver
hair
who
had
resigned
her
dreams
of
love
and
marriage
to
care
for
an
invalid
father
and
after
his
death
had
made
her
life
a
long
steady
search
for
ways
of
doing
kindnesses
to
others
a
poet
who
had
walked
among
the
crowded
tenements
of
the
great
city
bringing
cheer
and
comfort
not
only
by
his
songs
but
by
his
wise
and
patient
works
of
practical
aid
a
paralyzed
woman
who
had
lain
for
thirty
years
upon
her
bed
helpless
but
not
hopeless
succeeding
by
a
miracle
of
courage
in
her
single
aim
never
to
complain
but
always
to
impart
a
bit
of
her
joy
and
peace
to
every
one
who
came
near
her
all
these
and
other
persons
like
them
people
of
little
consideration
in
the
world
but
now
seemingly
all
full
of
great
contentment
and
an
inward
gladness
that
made
their
steps
light
were
in
the
company
that
passed
along
the
road
talking
together
of
things
past
and
things
to
come
and
singing
now
and
then
with
clear
voices
from
which
the
veil
of
age
and
sorrow
was
lifted
john
weightman
joined
in
some
of
the
songs
which
were
familiar
to
him
from
their
use
in
the
church
at
first
with
a
touch
of
hesitation
and
then
more
confidently
for
as
they
went
on
his
sense
of
strangeness
and
fear
at
his
new
experience
diminished
and
his
thoughts
began
to
take
on
their
habitual
assurance
and
complacency
were
not
these
people
going
to
the
celestial
city
and
was
not
he
in
his
right
place
among
them
he
had
always
looked
forward
to
this
journey
if
they
were
sure
each
one
of
finding
a
mansion
there
could
not
he
be
far
more
sure
his
life
had
been
more
fruitful
than
theirs
he
had
been
a
leader
a
founder
of
new
enterprises
a
pillar
of
church
and
state
a
prince
of
the
house
of
israel
ten
talents
had
been
given
him
and
he
had
made
them
twenty
his
reward
would
be
proportionate
he
was
glad
that
his
companions
were
going
to
find
fit
dwellings
prepared
for
them
but
he
thought
also
with
a
certain
pleasure
of
the
surprise
that
some
of
them
would
feel
when
they
saw
his
appointed
mansion
so
they
came
to
the
summit
of
the
moorland
and
looked
over
into
the
world
beyond
it
was
a
vast
green
plain
softly
rounded
like
a
shallow
vase
and
circled
with
hills
of
amethyst
a
broad
shining
river
flowed
through
it
and
many
silver
threads
of
water
were
woven
across
the
green
and
there
were
borders
of
tall
trees
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
orchards
full
of
roses
abloom
along
the
little
streams
and
in
the
midst
of
all
stood
the
city
white
and
wonderful
and
radiant
when
the
travelers
saw
it
they
were
filled
with
awe
and
joy
they
passed
over
the
little
streams
and
among
the
orchards
quickly
and
silently
as
if
they
feared
to
speak
lest
the
city
should
vanish
the
wall
of
the
city
was
very
low
a
child
could
see
over
it
for
it
was
made
only
of
precious
stones
which
are
never
large
the
gate
of
the
city
was
not
like
a
gate
at
all
for
it
was
not
barred
with
iron
or
wood
but
only
a
single
pearl
softly
gleaming
marked
the
place
where
the
wall
ended
and
the
entrance
lay
open
a
person
stood
there
whose
face
was
bright
and
grave
and
whose
robe
was
like
the
flower
of
the
lily
not
a
woven
fabric
but
a
living
texture
come
in
he
said
to
the
company
of
travelers
you
are
at
your
journey
end
and
your
mansions
are
ready
for
you
john
weightman
hesitated
for
he
was
troubled
by
a
doubt
suppose
that
he
was
not
really
like
his
companions
at
his
journey
end
but
only
transported
for
a
little
while
out
of
the
regular
course
of
his
life
into
this
mysterious
experience
suppose
that
after
all
he
had
not
really
passed
through
the
door
of
death
like
these
others
but
only
through
the
door
of
dreams
and
was
walking
in
a
vision
a
living
man
among
the
blessed
dead
would
it
be
right
for
him
to
go
with
them
into
the
heavenly
city
would
it
not
be
a
deception
a
desecration
a
deep
and
unforgivable
offense
the
strange
confusing
question
had
no
reason
in
it
as
he
very
well
knew
for
if
he
was
dreaming
then
it
was
all
a
dream
but
if
his
companions
were
real
then
he
also
was
with
them
in
reality
and
if
they
had
died
then
he
must
have
died
too
yet
he
could
not
rid
his
mind
of
the
sense
that
there
was
a
difference
between
them
and
him
and
it
made
him
afraid
to
go
on
but
as
he
paused
and
turned
the
keeper
of
the
gate
looked
straight
and
deep
into
his
eyes
and
beckoned
to
him
then
he
knew
that
it
was
not
only
right
but
necessary
that
he
should
enter
they
passed
from
street
to
street
among
fair
and
spacious
dwellings
set
in
amaranthine
gardens
and
adorned
with
an
infinitely
varied
beauty
of
divine
simplicity
the
mansions
differed
in
size
in
shape
in
charm
each
one
seemed
to
have
its
own
personal
look
of
loveliness
yet
all
were
alike
in
fitness
to
their
place
in
harmony
with
one
another
in
the
addition
which
each
made
to
the
singular
and
tranquil
splendor
of
the
city
as
the
little
company
came
one
by
one
to
the
mansions
which
were
prepared
for
them
and
their
guide
beckoned
to
the
happy
inhabitant
to
enter
in
and
take
possession
there
was
a
soft
murmur
of
joy
half
wonder
and
half
recognition
as
if
the
new
and
immortal
dwelling
were
crowned
with
the
beauty
of
surprise
lovelier
and
nobler
than
all
the
dreams
of
it
had
been
and
yet
also
as
if
it
were
touched
with
the
beauty
of
the
familiar
the
remembered
the
one
after
another
the
travelers
were
led
to
their
own
mansions
and
went
in
gladly
and
from
within
through
the
open
doorways
came
sweet
voices
of
welcome
and
low
laughter
and
song
at
last
there
was
no
one
left
with
the
guide
but
the
two
old
friends
doctor
mclean
and
john
weightman
they
were
standing
in
front
of
one
of
the
largest
and
fairest
of
the
houses
whose
garden
glowed
softly
with
radiant
flowers
the
guide
laid
his
hand
upon
the
shoulder
this
is
for
you
he
said
go
in
there
is
no
more
pain
here
no
more
death
nor
sorrow
nor
tears
for
your
old
enemies
are
all
conquered
but
all
the
good
that
you
have
done
for
others
all
the
help
that
you
have
given
all
the
comfort
that
you
have
brought
all
the
strength
and
love
that
you
have
bestowed
upon
the
suffering
are
here
for
we
have
built
them
all
into
this
mansion
for
you
the
good
man
face
was
lighted
with
a
still
joy
he
clasped
his
old
friend
hand
closely
and
whispered
how
wonderful
it
is
go
on
you
will
come
to
your
mansion
next
it
is
not
far
away
and
we
shall
see
each
other
again
soon
very
soon
so
he
went
through
the
garden
and
into
the
music
within
the
keeper
of
the
gate
turned
to
john
weightman
with
level
quiet
searching
eyes
then
he
asked
gravely
where
do
you
wish
me
to
lead
you
now
to
see
my
own
mansion
answered
the
man
with
excitement
is
there
not
one
here
for
me
you
may
not
let
me
enter
it
yet
perhaps
for
i
must
confess
to
you
that
i
am
only
i
know
said
the
keeper
of
the
gate
i
know
it
all
you
are
john
weightman
yes
said
the
man
more
firmly
than
he
had
spoken
at
first
for
it
gratified
him
that
his
name
was
known
yes
i
am
john
weightman
senior
warden
of
petronius
church
i
wish
very
much
to
see
my
mansion
here
if
only
for
a
moment
i
believe
that
you
have
one
for
me
will
you
take
me
to
it
the
keeper
of
the
gate
drew
a
little
book
from
the
breast
of
his
robe
and
turned
over
the
pages
certainly
he
said
with
a
curious
look
at
the
man
your
name
is
here
and
you
shall
see
your
mansion
if
you
will
follow
me
it
seemed
as
if
they
must
have
walked
miles
and
miles
through
the
vast
city
passing
street
after
street
of
houses
larger
and
smaller
of
gardens
richer
and
poorer
but
all
full
of
beauty
and
delight
they
came
into
a
kind
of
suburb
where
there
were
many
small
cottages
with
plots
of
flowers
very
lowly
but
bright
and
fragrant
finally
they
reached
an
open
field
bare
and
there
were
two
or
three
little
bushes
in
it
without
flowers
and
the
grass
was
sparse
and
thin
in
the
center
of
the
field
was
a
tiny
hut
hardly
big
enough
for
a
shepherd
shelter
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
built
of
discarded
things
scraps
and
fragments
of
other
buildings
put
together
with
care
and
pains
by
some
one
who
had
tried
to
make
the
most
of
material
there
was
something
pitiful
and
shamefaced
about
the
hut
it
shrank
and
drooped
and
faded
in
its
barren
field
and
seemed
to
cling
only
by
sufferance
to
the
edge
of
the
splendid
city
this
said
the
keeper
of
the
gate
standing
still
and
speaking
with
a
low
distinct
voice
this
is
your
mansion
john
weightman
an
almost
intolerable
shock
of
grieved
wonder
and
indignation
choked
the
man
for
a
moment
so
that
he
could
not
say
a
word
then
he
turned
his
face
away
from
the
poor
little
hut
and
began
to
remonstrate
eagerly
with
his
companion
surely
sir
he
stammered
you
must
be
in
error
about
this
there
is
something
wrong
some
other
john
weightman
a
confusion
of
names
the
book
must
be
mistaken
there
is
no
mistake
said
the
keeper
of
the
gate
very
calmly
here
is
your
name
the
record
of
your
title
and
your
possessions
in
this
place
but
how
could
such
a
house
be
prepared
for
me
cried
the
man
with
a
resentful
tremor
in
his
voice
for
me
after
my
long
and
faithful
service
is
this
a
suitable
mansion
for
one
so
well
known
and
devoted
why
is
it
so
pitifully
small
and
mean
why
have
you
not
built
it
large
and
fair
like
the
others
that
is
all
the
material
you
sent
us
what
we
have
used
all
the
material
that
you
sent
us
repeated
the
keeper
of
the
gate
now
i
know
that
you
are
mistaken
cried
the
man
with
growing
earnestness
for
all
my
life
long
i
have
been
doing
things
that
must
have
supplied
you
with
material
have
you
not
heard
that
i
have
built
a
the
wing
of
a
hospital
two
yes
three
small
churches
and
the
greater
part
of
a
large
one
the
spire
of
petro
the
keeper
of
the
gate
lifted
his
hand
wait
he
said
we
know
all
these
things
they
were
not
ill
done
but
they
were
all
marked
and
used
as
foundation
for
the
name
and
mansion
of
john
weightman
in
the
world
did
you
not
plan
them
for
that
yes
answered
the
man
confused
and
taken
aback
i
confess
that
i
thought
often
of
them
in
that
way
perhaps
my
heart
was
set
upon
that
too
much
but
there
are
other
things
my
endowment
for
the
college
my
steady
and
liberal
contributions
to
all
the
established
charities
my
support
of
every
respectable
wait
said
the
keeper
of
the
gate
again
were
not
all
these
carefully
recorded
on
earth
where
they
would
add
to
your
credit
they
were
not
foolishly
done
verily
you
have
had
your
reward
for
them
would
you
be
paid
twice
no
cried
the
man
with
deepening
dismay
i
dare
not
claim
that
i
acknowledge
that
i
considered
my
own
interest
too
much
but
surely
not
altogether
you
have
said
that
these
things
were
not
foolishly
done
they
accomplished
some
good
in
the
world
does
not
that
count
for
something
yes
answered
the
keeper
of
the
gate
it
counts
in
the
world
where
you
counted
it
but
it
does
not
belong
to
you
here
we
have
saved
and
used
everything
that
you
sent
us
this
is
the
mansion
prepared
for
you
as
he
spoke
his
look
grew
deeper
and
more
searching
like
a
flame
of
fire
john
weightman
could
not
endure
it
it
seemed
to
strip
him
naked
and
wither
him
he
sank
to
the
ground
under
a
crushing
weight
of
shame
covering
his
eyes
with
his
hands
and
cowering
face
downward
upon
the
stones
dimly
through
the
trouble
of
his
mind
he
felt
their
hardness
and
coldness
tell
me
then
he
cried
brokenly
since
my
life
has
been
so
little
worth
how
came
i
here
at
all
through
the
mercy
of
the
king
the
answer
was
like
the
soft
tolling
of
a
bell
and
how
have
i
earned
it
he
murmured
it
is
never
earned
it
is
only
given
came
the
clear
low
reply
but
how
have
i
failed
so
wretchedly
he
asked
in
all
the
purpose
of
my
life
what
could
i
have
done
better
what
is
it
that
counts
here
only
that
which
is
truly
given
answered
the
voice
only
that
good
which
is
done
for
the
love
of
doing
it
only
those
plans
in
which
the
welfare
of
others
is
the
master
thought
only
those
labors
in
which
the
sacrifice
is
greater
than
the
reward
only
those
gifts
in
which
the
giver
forgets
himself
the
man
lay
silent
a
great
weakness
an
unspeakable
despondency
and
humiliation
were
upon
him
but
the
face
of
the
keeper
of
the
gate
was
infinitely
tender
as
he
bent
over
him
think
again
john
weightman
has
there
been
nothing
like
that
in
your
life
nothing
he
sighed
if
there
ever
were
such
things
it
must
have
been
long
ago
they
were
all
crowded
out
i
have
forgotten
them
there
was
an
ineffable
smile
on
the
face
of
the
keeper
of
the
gate
and
his
hand
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
the
bowed
head
as
he
spoke
gently
these
are
the
things
that
the
king
never
forgets
and
because
there
were
a
few
of
them
in
your
life
you
have
a
little
place
here
the
sense
of
coldness
and
hardness
under
john
weightman
hands
grew
sharper
and
more
distinct
the
feeling
of
bodily
weariness
and
lassitude
weighed
upon
him
but
there
was
a
calm
almost
a
lightness
in
his
heart
as
he
listened
to
the
fading
vibrations
of
the
silvery
the
chimney
clock
on
the
mantel
had
just
ended
the
last
stroke
of
seven
as
he
lifted
his
head
from
the
table
thin
pale
strips
of
the
city
morning
were
falling
into
the
room
through
the
narrow
partings
of
the
heavy
curtains
what
was
it
that
had
happened
to
him
had
he
been
ill
had
he
died
and
come
to
life
again
or
had
he
only
slept
and
had
his
soul
gone
visiting
in
dreams
he
sat
for
some
time
motionless
not
lost
but
finding
himself
in
thought
then
he
took
a
narrow
book
from
the
table
drawer
wrote
a
check
and
tore
it
out
he
went
slowly
up
the
stairs
knocked
very
softly
at
his
son
door
and
hearing
no
answer
entered
without
noise
harold
was
asleep
his
bare
arm
thrown
above
his
head
and
his
eager
face
relaxed
in
peace
his
father
looked
at
him
a
moment
with
strangely
shining
eyes
and
then
tiptoed
quietly
to
the
found
a
pencil
and
a
sheet
of
paper
and
wrote
rapidly
my
dear
boy
here
is
what
you
asked
me
for
do
what
you
like
with
it
and
ask
for
more
if
you
need
it
if
you
are
still
thinking
of
that
work
with
grenfell

talk
it
over
after
church
i
want
to
know
your
heart
better
and
if
i
have
made
mistakes
illustration
god
give
us
a
good
christmas
together
a
slight
noise
made
him
turn
his
head
harold
was
sitting
up
in
bed
with
eyes
father
he
cried
is
that
you
yes
my
son
answered
john
weightman

back

mean

up

mean

in

and
god

us
a
good
christmas
together
the
end
