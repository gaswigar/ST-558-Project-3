euthyphro
by
plato
translated
by
benjamin
jowett
introduction
in
the
meno
anytus
had
parted
from
socrates
with
the
significant
words
in
any
city
and
particularly
in
the
city
of
athens
it
is
easier
to
do
men
harm
than
to
do
them
good
and
socrates
was
anticipating
another
opportunity
of
talking
with
him
in
the
euthyphro
socrates
is
awaiting
his
trial
for
impiety
but
before
the
trial
begins
plato
would
like
to
put
the
world
on
their
trial
and
convince
them
of
ignorance
in
that
very
matter
touching
which
socrates
is
accused
an
incident
which
may
perhaps
really
have
occurred
in
the
family
of
euthyphro
a
learned
athenian
diviner
and
soothsayer
furnishes
the
occasion
of
the
discussion
this
euthyphro
and
socrates
are
represented
as
meeting
in
the
porch
of
the
king
archon
compare
theaet
both
have
legal
business
in
hand
socrates
is
defendant
in
a
suit
for
impiety
which
meletus
has
brought
against
him
it
is
remarked
by
the
way
that
he
is
not
a
likely
man
himself
to
have
brought
a
suit
against
another
and
euthyphro
too
is
plaintiff
in
an
action
for
murder
which
he
has
brought
against
his
own
father
the
latter
has
originated
in
the
following
manner
a
poor
dependant
of
the
family
had
slain
one
of
their
domestic
slaves
in
naxos
the
guilty
person
was
bound
and
thrown
into
a
ditch
by
the
command
of
euthyphro
father
who
sent
to
the
interpreters
of
religion
at
athens
to
ask
what
should
be
done
with
him
before
the
messenger
came
back
the
criminal
had
died
from
hunger
and
exposure
this
is
the
origin
of
the
charge
of
murder
which
euthyphro
brings
against
his
father
socrates
is
confident
that
before
he
could
have
undertaken
the
responsibility
of
such
a
prosecution
he
must
have
been
perfectly
informed
of
the
nature
of
piety
and
impiety
and
as
he
is
going
to
be
tried
for
impiety
himself
he
thinks
that
he
can
not
do
better
than
learn
of
euthyphro
who
will
be
admitted
by
everybody
including
the
judges
to
be
an
unimpeachable
authority
what
piety
is
and
what
is
impiety
what
then
is
piety
euthyphro
who
in
the
abundance
of
his
knowledge
is
very
willing
to
undertake
all
the
responsibility
replies
that
piety
is
doing
as
i
do
prosecuting
your
father
if
he
is
guilty
on
a
charge
of
murder
doing
as
the
gods
do
as
zeus
did
to
cronos
and
cronos
to
uranus
socrates
has
a
dislike
to
these
tales
of
mythology
and
he
fancies
that
this
dislike
of
his
may
be
the
reason
why
he
is
charged
with
impiety
they
really
true
they
are
and
euthyphro
will
gladly
tell
socrates
some
more
of
them
but
socrates
would
like
first
of
all
to
have
a
more
satisfactory
answer
to
the
question
is
piety
as
i
do
charging
a
father
with
murder
may
be
a
single
instance
of
piety
but
can
hardly
be
regarded
as
a
general
definition
euthyphro
replies
that
is
what
is
dear
to
the
gods
and
impiety
is
what
is
not
dear
to
them
but
may
there
not
be
differences
of
opinion
as
among
men
so
also
among
the
gods
especially
about
good
and
evil
which
have
no
fixed
rule
and
these
are
precisely
the
sort
of
differences
which
give
rise
to
quarrels
and
therefore
what
may
be
dear
to
one
god
may
not
be
dear
to
another
and
the
same
action
may
be
both
pious
and
impious
your
chastisement
of
your
father
euthyphro
may
be
dear
or
pleasing
to
zeus
who
inflicted
a
similar
chastisement
on
his
own
father
but
not
equally
pleasing
to
cronos
or
uranus
who
suffered
at
the
hands
of
their
sons
euthyphro
answers
that
there
is
no
difference
of
opinion
either
among
gods
or
men
as
to
the
propriety
of
punishing
a
murderer
yes
rejoins
socrates
when
they
know
him
to
be
a
murderer
but
you
are
assuming
the
point
at
issue
if
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
are
considered
are
you
able
to
show
that
your
father
was
guilty
of
murder
or
that
all
the
gods
are
agreed
in
approving
of
our
prosecution
of
him
and
must
you
not
allow
that
what
is
hated
by
one
god
may
be
liked
by
another
waiving
this
last
however
socrates
proposes
to
amend
the
definition
and
say
that
all
the
gods
love
is
pious
and
what
they
all
hate
is
impious
to
this
euthyphro
agrees
socrates
proceeds
to
analyze
the
new
form
of
the
definition
he
shows
that
in
other
cases
the
act
precedes
the
state
the
act
of
being
carried
loved
etc
precedes
the
state
of
being
carried
loved
and
therefore
that
which
is
dear
to
the
gods
is
dear
to
the
gods
because
it
is
first
loved
of
them
not
loved
of
them
because
it
is
dear
to
them
but
the
pious
or
holy
is
loved
by
the
gods
because
it
is
pious
or
holy
which
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
it
is
loved
by
them
because
it
is
dear
to
them
here
then
appears
to
be
a
contradiction
euthyphro
has
been
giving
an
attribute
or
accident
of
piety
only
and
not
the
essence
euthyphro
acknowledges
himself
that
his
explanations
seem
to
walk
away
or
go
round
in
a
circle
like
the
moving
figures
of
daedalus
the
ancestor
of
socrates
who
has
communicated
his
art
to
his
descendants
socrates
who
is
desirous
of
stimulating
the
indolent
intelligence
of
euthyphro
raises
the
question
in
another
manner
all
the
pious
just
all
the
just
pious
what
part
of
justice
is
piety
euthyphro
replies
that
piety
is
that
part
of
justice
which
to
the
gods
as
there
is
another
part
of
justice
which
to
men
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
to
the
gods
the
word
when
applied
to
dogs
horses
and
men
implies
that
in
some
way
they
are
made
better
but
how
do
pious
or
holy
acts
make
the
gods
any
better
euthyphro
explains
that
he
means
by
pious
acts
acts
of
service
or
ministration
yes
but
the
ministrations
of
the
husbandman
the
physician
and
the
builder
have
an
end
to
what
end
do
we
serve
the
gods
and
what
do
we
help
them
to
accomplish
euthyphro
replies
that
all
these
difficult
questions
can
not
be
resolved
in
a
short
time
and
he
would
rather
say
simply
that
piety
is
knowing
how
to
please
the
gods
in
word
and
deed
by
prayers
and
sacrifices
in
other
words
says
socrates
piety
is
science
of
asking
and
giving
asking
what
we
want
and
giving
what
they
want
in
short
a
mode
of
doing
business
between
gods
and
men
but
although
they
are
the
givers
of
all
good
how
can
we
give
them
any
good
in
return
but
we
give
them
honour
then
we
give
them
not
what
is
beneficial
but
what
is
pleasing
or
dear
to
them
and
this
is
the
point
which
has
been
already
disproved
socrates
although
weary
of
the
subterfuges
and
evasions
of
euthyphro
remains
unshaken
in
his
conviction
that
he
must
know
the
nature
of
piety
or
he
would
never
have
prosecuted
his
old
father
he
is
still
hoping
that
he
will
condescend
to
instruct
him
but
euthyphro
is
in
a
hurry
and
can
not
stay
and
socrates
last
hope
of
knowing
the
nature
of
piety
before
he
is
prosecuted
for
impiety
has
disappeared
as
in
the
euthydemus
the
irony
is
carried
on
to
the
end
the
euthyphro
is
manifestly
designed
to
contrast
the
real
nature
of
piety
and
impiety
with
the
popular
conceptions
of
them
but
when
the
popular
conceptions
of
them
have
been
overthrown
socrates
does
not
offer
any
definition
of
his
own
as
in
the
laches
and
lysis
he
prepares
the
way
for
an
answer
to
the
question
which
he
has
raised
but
true
to
his
own
character
refuses
to
answer
himself
euthyphro
is
a
religionist
and
is
elsewhere
spoken
of
if
he
be
the
same
person
as
the
author
of
a
philosophy
of
names
by
whose
steeds
socrates
in
the
cratylus
is
carried
away
he
has
the
conceit
and
of
a
sophist
no
doubt
that
he
is
right
in
prosecuting
his
father
has
ever
entered
into
his
mind
like
a
sophist
too
he
is
incapable
either
of
framing
a
general
definition
or
of
following
the
course
of
an
argument
his
narrowness
positiveness
are
characteristic
of
his
priestly
office
his
failure
to
apprehend
an
argument
may
be
compared
to
a
similar
defect
which
is
observable
in
the
rhapsode
ion
but
he
is
not
a
bad
man
and
he
is
friendly
to
socrates
whose
familiar
sign
he
recognizes
with
interest
though
unable
to
follow
him
he
is
very
willing
to
be
led
by
him
and
eagerly
catches
at
any
suggestion
which
saves
him
from
the
trouble
of
thinking
moreover
he
is
the
enemy
of
meletus
who
as
he
says
is
availing
himself
of
the
popular
dislike
to
innovations
in
religion
in
order
to
injure
socrates
at
the
same
time
he
is
amusingly
confident
that
he
has
weapons
in
his
own
armoury
which
would
be
more
than
a
match
for
him
he
is
quite
sincere
in
his
prosecution
of
his
father
who
has
accidentally
been
guilty
of
homicide
and
is
not
wholly
free
from
blame
to
purge
away
the
crime
appears
to
him
in
the
light
of
a
duty
whoever
may
be
the
criminal
thus
begins
the
contrast
between
the
religion
of
the
letter
or
of
the
narrow
and
unenlightened
conscience
and
the
higher
notion
of
religion
which
socrates
vainly
endeavours
to
elicit
from
him
is
doing
as
i
do
is
the
idea
of
religion
which
first
occurs
to
him
and
to
many
others
who
do
not
say
what
they
think
with
equal
frankness
for
men
are
not
easily
persuaded
that
any
other
religion
is
better
than
their
own
or
that
other
nations
the
greeks
in
the
time
of
socrates
were
equally
serious
in
their
religious
beliefs
and
difficulties
the
chief
difference
between
us
and
them
is
that
they
were
slowly
learning
what
we
are
in
process
of
forgetting
greek
mythology
hardly
admitted
of
the
distinction
between
accidental
homicide
and
murder
that
the
pollution
of
blood
was
the
same
in
both
cases
is
also
the
feeling
of
the
athenian
diviner
he
had
not
as
yet
learned
the
lesson
which
philosophy
was
teaching
that
homer
and
hesiod
if
not
banished
from
the
state
or
whipped
out
of
the
assembly
as
heracleitus
more
rudely
proposed
at
any
rate
were
not
to
be
appealed
to
as
authorities
in
religion
and
he
is
ready
to
defend
his
conduct
by
the
examples
of
the
gods
these
are
the
very
tales
which
socrates
can
not
abide
and
his
dislike
of
them
as
he
suspects
has
branded
him
with
the
reputation
of
impiety
here
is
one
answer
to
the
question
socrates
was
put
to
death
suggested
by
the
way
another
is
conveyed
in
the
words
athenians
do
not
care
about
any
man
being
thought
wise
until
he
begins
to
make
other
men
wise
and
then
for
some
reason
or
other
they
are
angry
which
may
be
said
to
be
the
rule
of
popular
toleration
in
most
other
countries
and
not
at
athens
only
in
the
course
of
the
argument
socrates
remarks
that
the
controversial
nature
of
morals
and
religion
arises
out
of
the
difficulty
of
verifying
them
there
is
no
measure
or
standard
to
which
they
can
be
referred
the
next
definition
is
that
which
is
loved
of
the
gods
is
shipwrecked
on
a
refined
distinction
between
the
state
and
the
act
corresponding
respectively
to
the
adjective
philon
and
the
participle
philoumenon
or
rather
perhaps
to
the
participle
and
the
verb
philoumenon
and
phileitai
the
act
is
prior
to
the
state
as
in
aristotle
the
energeia
precedes
the
dunamis
and
the
state
of
being
loved
is
preceded
by
the
act
of
being
loved
but
piety
or
holiness
is
preceded
by
the
act
of
being
pious
not
by
the
act
of
being
loved
and
therefore
piety
and
the
state
of
being
loved
are
different
through
such
subtleties
of
dialectic
socrates
is
working
his
way
into
a
deeper
region
of
thought
and
feeling
he
means
to
say
that
the
words
of
the
gods
express
an
attribute
only
and
not
the
essence
of
piety
then
follows
the
third
and
last
definition
is
a
part
of
justice
thus
far
socrates
has
proceeded
in
placing
religion
on
a
moral
foundation
he
is
seeking
to
realize
the
harmony
of
religion
and
morality
which
the
great
poets
aeschylus
sophocles
and
pindar
had
unconsciously
anticipated
and
which
is
the
universal
want
of
all
men
to
this
the
soothsayer
adds
the
ceremonial
element
upon
the
gods
when
further
interrogated
by
socrates
as
to
the
nature
of
this
to
the
gods
he
replies
that
piety
is
an
affair
of
business
a
science
of
giving
and
asking
and
the
like
socrates
points
out
the
anthropomorphism
of
these
notions
compare
symp
republic
politicus
but
when
we
expect
him
to
go
on
and
show
that
the
true
service
of
the
gods
is
the
service
of
the
spirit
and
the
with
them
in
all
things
true
and
good
he
stops
short
this
was
a
lesson
which
the
soothsayer
could
not
have
been
made
to
understand
and
which
every
one
must
learn
for
himself
there
seem
to
be
altogether
three
aims
or
interests
in
this
little
dialogue
the
dialectical
development
of
the
idea
of
piety
the
antithesis
of
true
and
false
religion
which
is
carried
to
a
certain
extent
only
the
defence
of
socrates
the
subtle
connection
with
the
apology
and
the
crito
the
holding
back
of
the
conclusion
as
in
the
charmides
lysis
laches
protagoras
and
other
dialogues
the
deep
insight
into
the
religious
world
the
dramatic
power
and
play
of
the
two
characters
the
inimitable
irony
are
reasons
for
believing
that
the
euthyphro
is
a
genuine
platonic
writing
the
spirit
in
which
the
popular
representations
of
mythology
are
denounced
recalls
republic
ii
the
virtue
of
piety
has
been
already
mentioned
as
one
of
five
in
the
protagoras
but
is
not
reckoned
among
the
four
cardinal
virtues
of
republic
iv
the
figure
of
daedalus
has
occurred
in
the
meno
that
of
proteus
in
the
euthydemus
and
io
the
kingly
science
has
already
appeared
in
the
euthydemus
and
will
reappear
in
the
republic
and
statesman
but
neither
from
these
nor
any
other
indications
of
similarity
or
difference
and
still
less
from
arguments
respecting
the
suitableness
of
this
little
work
to
aid
socrates
at
the
time
of
his
trial
or
the
reverse
can
any
evidence
of
the
date
be
obtained
euthyphro
persons
of
the
dialogue
socrates
euthyphro
scene
the
porch
of
the
king
archon
euthyphro
why
have
you
left
the
lyceum
socrates
and
what
are
you
doing
in
the
porch
of
the
king
archon
surely
you
can
not
be
concerned
in
a
suit
before
the
king
like
myself
socrates
not
in
a
suit
euthyphro
impeachment
is
the
word
which
the
athenians
use
euthyphro
what
i
suppose
that
some
one
has
been
prosecuting
you
for
i
can
not
believe
that
you
are
the
prosecutor
of
another
socrates
certainly
not
euthyphro
then
some
one
else
has
been
prosecuting
you
socrates
yes
euthyphro
and
who
is
he
socrates
a
young
man
who
is
little
known
euthyphro
and
i
hardly
know
him
his
name
is
meletus
and
he
is
of
the
deme
of
pitthis
perhaps
you
may
remember
his
appearance
he
has
a
beak
and
long
straight
hair
and
a
beard
which
is
ill
grown
euthyphro
no
i
do
not
remember
him
socrates
but
what
is
the
charge
which
he
brings
against
you
socrates
what
is
the
charge
well
a
very
serious
charge
which
shows
a
good
deal
of
character
in
the
young
man
and
for
which
he
is
certainly
not
to
be
despised
he
says
he
knows
how
the
youth
are
corrupted
and
who
are
their
corruptors
i
fancy
that
he
must
be
a
wise
man
and
seeing
that
i
am
the
reverse
of
a
wise
man
he
has
found
me
out
and
is
going
to
accuse
me
of
corrupting
his
young
friends
and
of
this
our
mother
the
state
is
to
be
the
judge
of
all
our
political
men
he
is
the
only
one
who
seems
to
me
to
begin
in
the
right
way
with
the
cultivation
of
virtue
in
youth
like
a
good
husbandman
he
makes
the
young
shoots
his
first
care
and
clears
away
us
who
are
the
destroyers
of
them
this
is
only
the
first
step
he
will
afterwards
attend
to
the
elder
branches
and
if
he
goes
on
as
he
has
begun
he
will
be
a
very
great
public
benefactor
euthyphro
i
hope
that
he
may
but
i
rather
fear
socrates
that
the
opposite
will
turn
out
to
be
the
truth
my
opinion
is
that
in
attacking
you
he
is
simply
aiming
a
blow
at
the
foundation
of
the
state
but
in
what
way
does
he
say
that
you
corrupt
the
young
socrates
he
brings
a
wonderful
accusation
against
me
which
at
first
hearing
excites
surprise
he
says
that
i
am
a
poet
or
maker
of
gods
and
that
i
invent
new
gods
and
deny
the
existence
of
old
ones
this
is
the
ground
of
his
indictment
euthyphro
i
understand
socrates
he
means
to
attack
you
about
the
familiar
sign
which
occasionally
as
you
say
comes
to
you
he
thinks
that
you
are
a
neologian
and
he
is
going
to
have
you
up
before
the
court
for
this
he
knows
that
such
a
charge
is
readily
received
by
the
world
as
i
myself
know
too
well
for
when
i
speak
in
the
assembly
about
divine
things
and
foretell
the
future
to
them
they
laugh
at
me
and
think
me
a
madman
yet
every
word
that
i
say
is
true
but
they
are
jealous
of
us
all
and
we
must
be
brave
and
go
at
them
socrates
their
laughter
friend
euthyphro
is
not
a
matter
of
much
consequence
for
a
man
may
be
thought
wise
but
the
athenians
i
suspect
do
not
much
trouble
themselves
about
him
until
he
begins
to
impart
his
wisdom
to
others
and
then
for
some
reason
or
other
perhaps
as
you
say
from
jealousy
they
are
angry
euthyphro
i
am
never
likely
to
try
their
temper
in
this
way
socrates
i
dare
say
not
for
you
are
reserved
in
your
behaviour
and
seldom
impart
your
wisdom
but
i
have
a
benevolent
habit
of
pouring
out
myself
to
everybody
and
would
even
pay
for
a
listener
and
i
am
afraid
that
the
athenians
may
think
me
too
talkative
now
if
as
i
was
saying
they
would
only
laugh
at
me
as
you
say
that
they
laugh
at
you
the
time
might
pass
gaily
enough
in
the
court
but
perhaps
they
may
be
in
earnest
and
then
what
the
end
will
be
you
soothsayers
only
can
predict
euthyphro
i
dare
say
that
the
affair
will
end
in
nothing
socrates
and
that
you
will
win
your
cause
and
i
think
that
i
shall
win
my
own
socrates
and
what
is
your
suit
euthyphro
are
you
the
pursuer
or
the
defendant
euthyphro
i
am
the
pursuer
socrates
of
whom
euthyphro
you
will
think
me
mad
when
i
tell
you
socrates
why
has
the
fugitive
wings
euthyphro
nay
he
is
not
very
volatile
at
his
time
of
life
socrates
who
is
he
euthyphro
my
father
socrates
your
father
my
good
man
euthyphro
yes
socrates
and
of
what
is
he
accused
euthyphro
of
murder
socrates
socrates
by
the
powers
euthyphro
how
little
does
the
common
herd
know
of
the
nature
of
right
and
truth
a
man
must
be
an
extraordinary
man
and
have
made
great
strides
in
wisdom
before
he
could
have
seen
his
way
to
bring
such
an
action
euthyphro
indeed
socrates
he
must
socrates
i
suppose
that
the
man
whom
your
father
murdered
was
one
of
your
relatives
clearly
he
was
for
if
he
had
been
a
stranger
you
would
never
have
thought
of
prosecuting
him
euthyphro
i
am
amused
socrates
at
your
making
a
distinction
between
one
who
is
a
relation
and
one
who
is
not
a
relation
for
surely
the
pollution
is
the
same
in
either
case
if
you
knowingly
associate
with
the
murderer
when
you
ought
to
clear
yourself
and
him
by
proceeding
against
him
the
real
question
is
whether
the
murdered
man
has
been
justly
slain
if
justly
then
your
duty
is
to
let
the
matter
alone
but
if
unjustly
then
even
if
the
murderer
lives
under
the
same
roof
with
you
and
eats
at
the
same
table
proceed
against
him
now
the
man
who
is
dead
was
a
poor
dependant
of
mine
who
worked
for
us
as
a
field
labourer
on
our
farm
in
naxos
and
one
day
in
a
fit
of
drunken
passion
he
got
into
a
quarrel
with
one
of
our
domestic
servants
and
slew
him
my
father
bound
him
hand
and
foot
and
threw
him
into
a
ditch
and
then
sent
to
athens
to
ask
of
a
diviner
what
he
should
do
with
him
meanwhile
he
never
attended
to
him
and
took
no
care
about
him
for
he
regarded
him
as
a
murderer
and
thought
that
no
great
harm
would
be
done
even
if
he
did
die
now
this
was
just
what
happened
for
such
was
the
effect
of
cold
and
hunger
and
chains
upon
him
that
before
the
messenger
returned
from
the
diviner
he
was
dead
and
my
father
and
family
are
angry
with
me
for
taking
the
part
of
the
murderer
and
prosecuting
my
father
they
say
that
he
did
not
kill
him
and
that
if
he
did
the
dead
man
was
but
a
murderer
and
i
ought
not
to
take
any
notice
for
that
a
son
is
impious
who
prosecutes
a
father
which
shows
socrates
how
little
they
know
what
the
gods
think
about
piety
and
impiety
socrates
good
heavens
euthyphro
and
is
your
knowledge
of
religion
and
of
things
pious
and
impious
so
very
exact
that
supposing
the
circumstances
to
be
as
you
state
them
you
are
not
afraid
lest
you
too
may
be
doing
an
impious
thing
in
bringing
an
action
against
your
father
euthyphro
the
best
of
euthyphro
and
that
which
distinguishes
him
socrates
from
other
men
is
his
exact
knowledge
of
all
such
matters
what
should
i
be
good
for
without
it
socrates
rare
friend
i
think
that
i
can
not
do
better
than
be
your
disciple
then
before
the
trial
with
meletus
comes
on
i
shall
challenge
him
and
say
that
i
have
always
had
a
great
interest
in
religious
questions
and
now
as
he
charges
me
with
rash
imaginations
and
innovations
in
religion
i
have
become
your
disciple
you
meletus
as
i
shall
say
to
him
acknowledge
euthyphro
to
be
a
great
theologian
and
sound
in
his
opinions
and
if
you
approve
of
him
you
ought
to
approve
of
me
and
not
have
me
into
court
but
if
you
disapprove
you
should
begin
by
indicting
him
who
is
my
teacher
and
who
will
be
the
ruin
not
of
the
young
but
of
the
old
that
is
to
say
of
myself
whom
he
instructs
and
of
his
old
father
whom
he
admonishes
and
chastises
and
if
meletus
refuses
to
listen
to
me
but
will
go
on
and
will
not
shift
the
indictment
from
me
to
you
i
can
not
do
better
than
repeat
this
challenge
in
the
court
euthyphro
yes
indeed
socrates
and
if
he
attempts
to
indict
me
i
am
mistaken
if
i
do
not
find
a
flaw
in
him
the
court
shall
have
a
great
deal
more
to
say
to
him
than
to
me
socrates
and
i
my
dear
friend
knowing
this
am
desirous
of
becoming
your
disciple
for
i
observe
that
no
one
appears
to
notice
you
not
even
this
meletus
but
his
sharp
eyes
have
found
me
out
at
once
and
he
has
indicted
me
for
impiety
and
therefore
i
adjure
you
to
tell
me
the
nature
of
piety
and
impiety
which
you
said
that
you
knew
so
well
and
of
murder
and
of
other
offences
against
the
gods
what
are
they
is
not
piety
in
every
action
always
the
same
and
impiety
again
is
it
not
always
the
opposite
of
piety
and
also
the
same
with
itself
having
as
impiety
one
notion
which
includes
whatever
is
impious
euthyphro
to
be
sure
socrates
socrates
and
what
is
piety
and
what
is
impiety
euthyphro
piety
is
doing
as
i
am
doing
that
is
to
say
prosecuting
any
one
who
is
guilty
of
murder
sacrilege
or
of
any
similar
crime
whether
he
be
your
father
or
mother
or
whoever
he
may
be
that
makes
no
difference
and
not
to
prosecute
them
is
impiety
and
please
to
consider
socrates
what
a
notable
proof
i
will
give
you
of
the
truth
of
my
words
a
proof
which
i
have
already
given
to
others
of
the
principle
i
mean
that
the
impious
whoever
he
may
be
ought
not
to
go
unpunished
for
do
not
men
regard
zeus
as
the
best
and
most
righteous
of
the
gods
and
yet
they
admit
that
he
bound
his
father
cronos
because
he
wickedly
devoured
his
sons
and
that
he
too
had
punished
his
own
father
uranus
for
a
similar
reason
in
a
nameless
manner
and
yet
when
i
proceed
against
my
father
they
are
angry
with
me
so
inconsistent
are
they
in
their
way
of
talking
when
the
gods
are
concerned
and
when
i
am
concerned
socrates
may
not
this
be
the
reason
euthyphro
why
i
am
charged
with
impiety
that
i
can
not
away
with
these
stories
about
the
gods
and
therefore
i
suppose
that
people
think
me
wrong
but
as
you
who
are
well
informed
about
them
approve
of
them
i
can
not
do
better
than
assent
to
your
superior
wisdom
what
else
can
i
say
confessing
as
i
do
that
i
know
nothing
about
them
tell
me
for
the
love
of
zeus
whether
you
really
believe
that
they
are
true
euthyphro
yes
socrates
and
things
more
wonderful
still
of
which
the
world
is
in
ignorance
socrates
and
do
you
really
believe
that
the
gods
fought
with
one
another
and
had
dire
quarrels
battles
and
the
like
as
the
poets
say
and
as
you
may
see
represented
in
the
works
of
great
artists
the
temples
are
full
of
them
and
notably
the
robe
of
athene
which
is
carried
up
to
the
acropolis
at
the
great
panathenaea
is
embroidered
with
them
are
all
these
tales
of
the
gods
true
euthyphro
euthyphro
yes
socrates
and
as
i
was
saying
i
can
tell
you
if
you
would
like
to
hear
them
many
other
things
about
the
gods
which
would
quite
amaze
you
socrates
i
dare
say
and
you
shall
tell
me
them
at
some
other
time
when
i
have
leisure
but
just
at
present
i
would
rather
hear
from
you
a
more
precise
answer
which
you
have
not
as
yet
given
my
friend
to
the
question
what
is
when
asked
you
only
replied
doing
as
you
do
charging
your
father
with
murder
euthyphro
and
what
i
said
was
true
socrates
socrates
no
doubt
euthyphro
but
you
would
admit
that
there
are
many
other
pious
acts
euthyphro
there
are
socrates
remember
that
i
did
not
ask
you
to
give
me
two
or
three
examples
of
piety
but
to
explain
the
general
idea
which
makes
all
pious
things
to
be
pious
do
you
not
recollect
that
there
was
one
idea
which
made
the
impious
impious
and
the
pious
pious
euthyphro
i
remember
socrates
tell
me
what
is
the
nature
of
this
idea
and
then
i
shall
have
a
standard
to
which
i
may
look
and
by
which
i
may
measure
actions
whether
yours
or
those
of
any
one
else
and
then
i
shall
be
able
to
say
that
such
and
such
an
action
is
pious
such
another
impious
euthyphro
i
will
tell
you
if
you
like
socrates
i
should
very
much
like
euthyphro
piety
then
is
that
which
is
dear
to
the
gods
and
impiety
is
that
which
is
not
dear
to
them
socrates
very
good
euthyphro
you
have
now
given
me
the
sort
of
answer
which
i
wanted
but
whether
what
you
say
is
true
or
not
i
can
not
as
yet
tell
although
i
make
no
doubt
that
you
will
prove
the
truth
of
your
words
euthyphro
of
course
socrates
come
then
and
let
us
examine
what
we
are
saying
that
thing
or
person
which
is
dear
to
the
gods
is
pious
and
that
thing
or
person
which
is
hateful
to
the
gods
is
impious
these
two
being
the
extreme
opposites
of
one
another
was
not
that
said
euthyphro
it
was
socrates
and
well
said
euthyphro
yes
socrates
i
thought
so
it
was
certainly
said
socrates
and
further
euthyphro
the
gods
were
admitted
to
have
enmities
and
hatreds
and
differences
euthyphro
yes
that
was
also
said
socrates
and
what
sort
of
difference
creates
enmity
and
anger
suppose
for
example
that
you
and
i
my
good
friend
differ
about
a
number
do
differences
of
this
sort
make
us
enemies
and
set
us
at
variance
with
one
another
do
we
not
go
at
once
to
arithmetic
and
put
an
end
to
them
by
a
sum
euthyphro
true
socrates
or
suppose
that
we
differ
about
magnitudes
do
we
not
quickly
end
the
differences
by
measuring
euthyphro
very
true
socrates
and
we
end
a
controversy
about
heavy
and
light
by
resorting
to
a
weighing
machine
euthyphro
to
be
sure
socrates
but
what
differences
are
there
which
can
not
be
thus
decided
and
which
therefore
make
us
angry
and
set
us
at
enmity
with
one
another
i
dare
say
the
answer
does
not
occur
to
you
at
the
moment
and
therefore
i
will
suggest
that
these
enmities
arise
when
the
matters
of
difference
are
the
just
and
unjust
good
and
evil
honourable
and
dishonourable
are
not
these
the
points
about
which
men
differ
and
about
which
when
we
are
unable
satisfactorily
to
decide
our
differences
you
and
i
and
all
of
us
quarrel
when
we
do
quarrel
compare
alcib
euthyphro
yes
socrates
the
nature
of
the
differences
about
which
we
quarrel
is
such
as
you
describe
socrates
and
the
quarrels
of
the
gods
noble
euthyphro
when
they
occur
are
of
a
like
nature
euthyphro
certainly
they
are
socrates
they
have
differences
of
opinion
as
you
say
about
good
and
evil
just
and
unjust
honourable
and
dishonourable
there
would
have
been
no
quarrels
among
them
if
there
had
been
no
such
differences
would
there
now
euthyphro
you
are
quite
right
socrates
does
not
every
man
love
that
which
he
deems
noble
and
just
and
good
and
hate
the
opposite
of
them
euthyphro
very
true
socrates
but
as
you
say
people
regard
the
same
things
some
as
just
and
others
as
unjust
about
these
they
dispute
and
so
there
arise
wars
and
fightings
among
them
euthyphro
very
true
socrates
then
the
same
things
are
hated
by
the
gods
and
loved
by
the
gods
and
are
both
hateful
and
dear
to
them
euthyphro
true
socrates
and
upon
this
view
the
same
things
euthyphro
will
be
pious
and
also
impious
euthyphro
so
i
should
suppose
socrates
then
my
friend
i
remark
with
surprise
that
you
have
not
answered
the
question
which
i
asked
for
i
certainly
did
not
ask
you
to
tell
me
what
action
is
both
pious
and
impious
but
now
it
would
seem
that
what
is
loved
by
the
gods
is
also
hated
by
them
and
therefore
euthyphro
in
thus
chastising
your
father
you
may
very
likely
be
doing
what
is
agreeable
to
zeus
but
disagreeable
to
cronos
or
uranus
and
what
is
acceptable
to
hephaestus
but
unacceptable
to
here
and
there
may
be
other
gods
who
have
similar
differences
of
opinion
euthyphro
but
i
believe
socrates
that
all
the
gods
would
be
agreed
as
to
the
propriety
of
punishing
a
murderer
there
would
be
no
difference
of
opinion
about
that
socrates
well
but
speaking
of
men
euthyphro
did
you
ever
hear
any
one
arguing
that
a
murderer
or
any
sort
of
ought
to
be
let
off
euthyphro
i
should
rather
say
that
these
are
the
questions
which
they
are
always
arguing
especially
in
courts
of
law
they
commit
all
sorts
of
crimes
and
there
is
nothing
which
they
will
not
do
or
say
in
their
own
defence
socrates
but
do
they
admit
their
guilt
euthyphro
and
yet
say
that
they
ought
not
to
be
punished
euthyphro
no
they
do
not
socrates
then
there
are
some
things
which
they
do
not
venture
to
say
and
do
for
they
do
not
venture
to
argue
that
the
guilty
are
to
be
unpunished
but
they
deny
their
guilt
do
they
not
euthyphro
yes
socrates
then
they
do
not
argue
that
the
should
not
be
punished
but
they
argue
about
the
fact
of
who
the
is
and
what
he
did
and
when
euthyphro
true
socrates
and
the
gods
are
in
the
same
case
if
as
you
assert
they
quarrel
about
just
and
unjust
and
some
of
them
say
while
others
deny
that
injustice
is
done
among
them
for
surely
neither
god
nor
man
will
ever
venture
to
say
that
the
doer
of
injustice
is
not
to
be
punished
euthyphro
that
is
true
socrates
in
the
main
socrates
but
they
join
issue
about
the
particulars
gods
and
men
alike
and
if
they
dispute
at
all
they
dispute
about
some
act
which
is
called
in
question
and
which
by
some
is
affirmed
to
be
just
by
others
to
be
unjust
is
not
that
true
euthyphro
quite
true
socrates
well
then
my
dear
friend
euthyphro
do
tell
me
for
my
better
instruction
and
information
what
proof
have
you
that
in
the
opinion
of
all
the
gods
a
servant
who
is
guilty
of
murder
and
is
put
in
chains
by
the
master
of
the
dead
man
and
dies
because
he
is
put
in
chains
before
he
who
bound
him
can
learn
from
the
interpreters
of
the
gods
what
he
ought
to
do
with
him
dies
unjustly
and
that
on
behalf
of
such
an
one
a
son
ought
to
proceed
against
his
father
and
accuse
him
of
murder
how
would
you
show
that
all
the
gods
absolutely
agree
in
approving
of
his
act
prove
to
me
that
they
do
and
i
will
applaud
your
wisdom
as
long
as
i
live
euthyphro
it
will
be
a
difficult
task
but
i
could
make
the
matter
very
clear
indeed
to
you
socrates
i
understand
you
mean
to
say
that
i
am
not
so
quick
of
apprehension
as
the
judges
for
to
them
you
will
be
sure
to
prove
that
the
act
is
unjust
and
hateful
to
the
gods
euthyphro
yes
indeed
socrates
at
least
if
they
will
listen
to
me
socrates
but
they
will
be
sure
to
listen
if
they
find
that
you
are
a
good
speaker
there
was
a
notion
that
came
into
my
mind
while
you
were
speaking
i
said
to
myself
and
what
if
euthyphro
does
prove
to
me
that
all
the
gods
regarded
the
death
of
the
serf
as
unjust
how
do
i
know
anything
more
of
the
nature
of
piety
and
impiety
for
granting
that
this
action
may
be
hateful
to
the
gods
still
piety
and
impiety
are
not
adequately
defined
by
these
distinctions
for
that
which
is
hateful
to
the
gods
has
been
shown
to
be
also
pleasing
and
dear
to
them
and
therefore
euthyphro
i
do
not
ask
you
to
prove
this
i
will
suppose
if
you
like
that
all
the
gods
condemn
and
abominate
such
an
action
but
i
will
amend
the
definition
so
far
as
to
say
that
what
all
the
gods
hate
is
impious
and
what
they
love
pious
or
holy
and
what
some
of
them
love
and
others
hate
is
both
or
neither
shall
this
be
our
definition
of
piety
and
impiety
euthyphro
why
not
socrates
socrates
why
not
certainly
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
euthyphro
there
is
no
reason
why
not
but
whether
this
admission
will
greatly
assist
you
in
the
task
of
instructing
me
as
you
promised
is
a
matter
for
you
to
consider
euthyphro
yes
i
should
say
that
what
all
the
gods
love
is
pious
and
holy
and
the
opposite
which
they
all
hate
impious
socrates
ought
we
to
enquire
into
the
truth
of
this
euthyphro
or
simply
to
accept
the
mere
statement
on
our
own
authority
and
that
of
others
what
do
you
say
euthyphro
we
should
enquire
and
i
believe
that
the
statement
will
stand
the
test
of
enquiry
socrates
we
shall
know
better
my
good
friend
in
a
little
while
the
point
which
i
should
first
wish
to
understand
is
whether
the
pious
or
holy
is
beloved
by
the
gods
because
it
is
holy
or
holy
because
it
is
beloved
of
the
gods
euthyphro
i
do
not
understand
your
meaning
socrates
socrates
i
will
endeavour
to
explain
we
speak
of
carrying
and
we
speak
of
being
carried
of
leading
and
being
led
seeing
and
being
seen
you
know
that
in
all
such
cases
there
is
a
difference
and
you
know
also
in
what
the
difference
lies
euthyphro
i
think
that
i
understand
socrates
and
is
not
that
which
is
beloved
distinct
from
that
which
loves
euthyphro
certainly
socrates
well
and
now
tell
me
is
that
which
is
carried
in
this
state
of
carrying
because
it
is
carried
or
for
some
other
reason
euthyphro
no
that
is
the
reason
socrates
and
the
same
is
true
of
what
is
led
and
of
what
is
seen
euthyphro
true
socrates
and
a
thing
is
not
seen
because
it
is
visible
but
conversely
visible
because
it
is
seen
nor
is
a
thing
led
because
it
is
in
the
state
of
being
led
or
carried
because
it
is
in
the
state
of
being
carried
but
the
converse
of
this
and
now
i
think
euthyphro
that
my
meaning
will
be
intelligible
and
my
meaning
is
that
any
state
of
action
or
passion
implies
previous
action
or
passion
it
does
not
become
because
it
is
becoming
but
it
is
in
a
state
of
becoming
because
it
becomes
neither
does
it
suffer
because
it
is
in
a
state
of
suffering
but
it
is
in
a
state
of
suffering
because
it
suffers
do
you
not
agree
euthyphro
yes
socrates
is
not
that
which
is
loved
in
some
state
either
of
becoming
or
suffering
euthyphro
yes
socrates
and
the
same
holds
as
in
the
previous
instances
the
state
of
being
loved
follows
the
act
of
being
loved
and
not
the
act
the
state
euthyphro
certainly
socrates
and
what
do
you
say
of
piety
euthyphro
is
not
piety
according
to
your
definition
loved
by
all
the
gods
euthyphro
yes
socrates
because
it
is
pious
or
holy
or
for
some
other
reason
euthyphro
no
that
is
the
reason
socrates
it
is
loved
because
it
is
holy
not
holy
because
it
is
loved
euthyphro
yes
socrates
and
that
which
is
dear
to
the
gods
is
loved
by
them
and
is
in
a
state
to
be
loved
of
them
because
it
is
loved
of
them
euthyphro
certainly
socrates
then
that
which
is
dear
to
the
gods
euthyphro
is
not
holy
nor
is
that
which
is
holy
loved
of
god
as
you
affirm
but
they
are
two
different
things
euthyphro
how
do
you
mean
socrates
socrates
i
mean
to
say
that
the
holy
has
been
acknowledged
by
us
to
be
loved
of
god
because
it
is
holy
not
to
be
holy
because
it
is
loved
euthyphro
yes
socrates
but
that
which
is
dear
to
the
gods
is
dear
to
them
because
it
is
loved
by
them
not
loved
by
them
because
it
is
dear
to
them
euthyphro
true
socrates
but
friend
euthyphro
if
that
which
is
holy
is
the
same
with
that
which
is
dear
to
god
and
is
loved
because
it
is
holy
then
that
which
is
dear
to
god
would
have
been
loved
as
being
dear
to
god
but
if
that
which
is
dear
to
god
is
dear
to
him
because
loved
by
him
then
that
which
is
holy
would
have
been
holy
because
loved
by
him
but
now
you
see
that
the
reverse
is
the
case
and
that
they
are
quite
different
from
one
another
for
one
theophiles
is
of
a
kind
to
be
loved
cause
it
is
loved
and
the
other
osion
is
loved
because
it
is
of
a
kind
to
be
loved
thus
you
appear
to
me
euthyphro
when
i
ask
you
what
is
the
essence
of
holiness
to
offer
an
attribute
only
and
not
the
essence
the
attribute
of
being
loved
by
all
the
gods
but
you
still
refuse
to
explain
to
me
the
nature
of
holiness
and
therefore
if
you
please
i
will
ask
you
not
to
hide
your
treasure
but
to
tell
me
once
more
what
holiness
or
piety
really
is
whether
dear
to
the
gods
or
not
for
that
is
a
matter
about
which
we
will
not
quarrel
and
what
is
impiety
euthyphro
i
really
do
not
know
socrates
how
to
express
what
i
mean
for
somehow
or
other
our
arguments
on
whatever
ground
we
rest
them
seem
to
turn
round
and
walk
away
from
us
socrates
your
words
euthyphro
are
like
the
handiwork
of
my
ancestor
daedalus
and
if
i
were
the
sayer
or
propounder
of
them
you
might
say
that
my
arguments
walk
away
and
will
not
remain
fixed
where
they
are
placed
because
i
am
a
descendant
of
his
but
now
since
these
notions
are
your
own
you
must
find
some
other
gibe
for
they
certainly
as
you
yourself
allow
show
an
inclination
to
be
on
the
move
euthyphro
nay
socrates
i
shall
still
say
that
you
are
the
daedalus
who
sets
arguments
in
motion
not
i
certainly
but
you
make
them
move
or
go
round
for
they
would
never
have
stirred
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
socrates
then
i
must
be
a
greater
than
daedalus
for
whereas
he
only
made
his
own
inventions
to
move
i
move
those
of
other
people
as
well
and
the
beauty
of
it
is
that
i
would
rather
not
for
i
would
give
the
wisdom
of
daedalus
and
the
wealth
of
tantalus
to
be
able
to
detain
them
and
keep
them
fixed
but
enough
of
this
as
i
perceive
that
you
are
lazy
i
will
myself
endeavour
to
show
you
how
you
might
instruct
me
in
the
nature
of
piety
and
i
hope
that
you
will
not
grudge
your
labour
tell
me
then
is
not
that
which
is
pious
necessarily
just
euthyphro
yes
socrates
and
is
then
all
which
is
just
pious
or
is
that
which
is
pious
all
just
but
that
which
is
just
only
in
part
and
not
all
pious
euthyphro
i
do
not
understand
you
socrates
socrates
and
yet
i
know
that
you
are
as
much
wiser
than
i
am
as
you
are
younger
but
as
i
was
saying
revered
friend
the
abundance
of
your
wisdom
makes
you
lazy
please
to
exert
yourself
for
there
is
no
real
difficulty
in
understanding
me
what
i
mean
i
may
explain
by
an
illustration
of
what
i
do
not
mean
the
poet
stasinus
sings
zeus
the
author
and
creator
of
all
these
things
you
will
not
tell
for
where
there
is
fear
there
is
also
reverence
now
i
disagree
with
this
poet
shall
i
tell
you
in
what
respect
euthyphro
by
all
means
socrates
i
should
not
say
that
where
there
is
fear
there
is
also
reverence
for
i
am
sure
that
many
persons
fear
poverty
and
disease
and
the
like
evils
but
i
do
not
perceive
that
they
reverence
the
objects
of
their
fear
euthyphro
very
true
socrates
but
where
reverence
is
there
is
fear
for
he
who
has
a
feeling
of
reverence
and
shame
about
the
commission
of
any
action
fears
and
is
afraid
of
an
ill
reputation
euthyphro
no
doubt
socrates
then
we
are
wrong
in
saying
that
where
there
is
fear
there
is
also
reverence
and
we
should
say
where
there
is
reverence
there
is
also
fear
but
there
is
not
always
reverence
where
there
is
fear
for
fear
is
a
more
extended
notion
and
reverence
is
a
part
of
fear
just
as
the
odd
is
a
part
of
number
and
number
is
a
more
extended
notion
than
the
odd
i
suppose
that
you
follow
me
now
euthyphro
quite
well
socrates
that
was
the
sort
of
question
which
i
meant
to
raise
when
i
asked
whether
the
just
is
always
the
pious
or
the
pious
always
the
just
and
whether
there
may
not
be
justice
where
there
is
not
piety
for
justice
is
the
more
extended
notion
of
which
piety
is
only
a
part
do
you
dissent
euthyphro
no
i
think
that
you
are
quite
right
socrates
then
if
piety
is
a
part
of
justice
i
suppose
that
we
should
enquire
what
part
if
you
had
pursued
the
enquiry
in
the
previous
cases
for
instance
if
you
had
asked
me
what
is
an
even
number
and
what
part
of
number
the
even
is
i
should
have
had
no
difficulty
in
replying
a
number
which
represents
a
figure
having
two
equal
sides
do
you
not
agree
euthyphro
yes
i
quite
agree
socrates
in
like
manner
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
part
of
justice
is
piety
or
holiness
that
i
may
be
able
to
tell
meletus
not
to
do
me
injustice
or
indict
me
for
impiety
as
i
am
now
adequately
instructed
by
you
in
the
nature
of
piety
or
holiness
and
their
opposites
euthyphro
piety
or
holiness
socrates
appears
to
me
to
be
that
part
of
justice
which
attends
to
the
gods
as
there
is
the
other
part
of
justice
which
attends
to
men
socrates
that
is
good
euthyphro
yet
still
there
is
a
little
point
about
which
i
should
like
to
have
further
information
what
is
the
meaning
of
for
attention
can
hardly
be
used
in
the
same
sense
when
applied
to
the
gods
as
when
applied
to
other
things
for
instance
horses
are
said
to
require
attention
and
not
every
person
is
able
to
attend
to
them
but
only
a
person
skilled
in
horsemanship
is
it
not
so
euthyphro
certainly
socrates
i
should
suppose
that
the
art
of
horsemanship
is
the
art
of
attending
to
horses
euthyphro
yes
socrates
nor
is
every
one
qualified
to
attend
to
dogs
but
only
the
huntsman
euthyphro
true
socrates
and
i
should
also
conceive
that
the
art
of
the
huntsman
is
the
art
of
attending
to
dogs
euthyphro
yes
socrates
as
the
art
of
the
oxherd
is
the
art
of
attending
to
oxen
euthyphro
very
true
socrates
in
like
manner
holiness
or
piety
is
the
art
of
attending
to
the
gods
that
would
be
your
meaning
euthyphro
euthyphro
yes
socrates
and
is
not
attention
always
designed
for
the
good
or
benefit
of
that
to
which
the
attention
is
given
as
in
the
case
of
horses
you
may
observe
that
when
attended
to
by
the
horseman
art
they
are
benefited
and
improved
are
they
not
euthyphro
true
socrates
as
the
dogs
are
benefited
by
the
huntsman
art
and
the
oxen
by
the
art
of
the
oxherd
and
all
other
things
are
tended
or
attended
for
their
good
and
not
for
their
hurt
euthyphro
certainly
not
for
their
hurt
socrates
but
for
their
good
euthyphro
of
course
socrates
and
does
piety
or
holiness
which
has
been
defined
to
be
the
art
of
attending
to
the
gods
benefit
or
improve
them
would
you
say
that
when
you
do
a
holy
act
you
make
any
of
the
gods
better
euthyphro
no
no
that
was
certainly
not
what
i
meant
socrates
and
i
euthyphro
never
supposed
that
you
did
i
asked
you
the
question
about
the
nature
of
the
attention
because
i
thought
that
you
did
not
euthyphro
you
do
me
justice
socrates
that
is
not
the
sort
of
attention
which
i
mean
socrates
good
but
i
must
still
ask
what
is
this
attention
to
the
gods
which
is
called
piety
euthyphro
it
is
such
socrates
as
servants
show
to
their
masters
socrates
i
understand
a
sort
of
ministration
to
the
gods
euthyphro
exactly
socrates
medicine
is
also
a
sort
of
ministration
or
service
having
in
view
the
attainment
of
some
object
would
you
not
say
of
health
euthyphro
i
should
socrates
again
there
is
an
art
which
ministers
to
the
with
a
view
to
the
attainment
of
some
result
euthyphro
yes
socrates
with
a
view
to
the
building
of
a
ship
socrates
as
there
is
an
art
which
ministers
to
the
with
a
view
to
the
building
of
a
house
euthyphro
yes
socrates
and
now
tell
me
my
good
friend
about
the
art
which
ministers
to
the
gods
what
work
does
that
help
to
accomplish
for
you
must
surely
know
if
as
you
say
you
are
of
all
men
living
the
one
who
is
best
instructed
in
religion
euthyphro
and
i
speak
the
truth
socrates
socrates
tell
me
then
oh
tell
me
what
is
that
fair
work
which
the
gods
do
by
the
help
of
our
ministrations
euthyphro
many
and
fair
socrates
are
the
works
which
they
do
socrates
why
my
friend
and
so
are
those
of
a
general
but
the
chief
of
them
is
easily
told
would
you
not
say
that
victory
in
war
is
the
chief
of
them
euthyphro
certainly
socrates
many
and
fair
too
are
the
works
of
the
husbandman
if
i
am
not
mistaken
but
his
chief
work
is
the
production
of
food
from
the
earth
euthyphro
exactly
socrates
and
of
the
many
and
fair
things
done
by
the
gods
which
is
the
chief
or
principal
one
euthyphro
i
have
told
you
already
socrates
that
to
learn
all
these
things
accurately
will
be
very
tiresome
let
me
simply
say
that
piety
or
holiness
is
learning
how
to
please
the
gods
in
word
and
deed
by
prayers
and
sacrifices
such
piety
is
the
salvation
of
families
and
states
just
as
the
impious
which
is
unpleasing
to
the
gods
is
their
ruin
and
destruction
socrates
i
think
that
you
could
have
answered
in
much
fewer
words
the
chief
question
which
i
asked
euthyphro
if
you
had
chosen
but
i
see
plainly
that
you
are
not
disposed
to
instruct
me
clearly
not
else
why
when
we
reached
the
point
did
you
turn
aside
had
you
only
answered
me
i
should
have
truly
learned
of
you
by
this
time
the
nature
of
piety
now
as
the
asker
of
a
question
is
necessarily
dependent
on
the
answerer
whither
he
leads
i
must
follow
and
can
only
ask
again
what
is
the
pious
and
what
is
piety
do
you
mean
that
they
are
a
sort
of
science
of
praying
and
sacrificing
euthyphro
yes
i
do
socrates
and
sacrificing
is
giving
to
the
gods
and
prayer
is
asking
of
the
gods
euthyphro
yes
socrates
socrates
upon
this
view
then
piety
is
a
science
of
asking
and
giving
euthyphro
you
understand
me
capitally
socrates
socrates
yes
my
friend
the
reason
is
that
i
am
a
votary
of
your
science
and
give
my
mind
to
it
and
therefore
nothing
which
you
say
will
be
thrown
away
upon
me
please
then
to
tell
me
what
is
the
nature
of
this
service
to
the
gods
do
you
mean
that
we
prefer
requests
and
give
gifts
to
them
euthyphro
yes
i
do
socrates
is
not
the
right
way
of
asking
to
ask
of
them
what
we
want
euthyphro
certainly
socrates
and
the
right
way
of
giving
is
to
give
to
them
in
return
what
they
want
of
us
there
would
be
no
meaning
in
an
art
which
gives
to
any
one
that
which
he
does
not
want
euthyphro
very
true
socrates
socrates
then
piety
euthyphro
is
an
art
which
gods
and
men
have
of
doing
business
with
one
another
euthyphro
that
is
an
expression
which
you
may
use
if
you
like
socrates
but
i
have
no
particular
liking
for
anything
but
the
truth
i
wish
however
that
you
would
tell
me
what
benefit
accrues
to
the
gods
from
our
gifts
there
is
no
doubt
about
what
they
give
to
us
for
there
is
no
good
thing
which
they
do
not
give
but
how
we
can
give
any
good
thing
to
them
in
return
is
far
from
being
equally
clear
if
they
give
everything
and
we
give
nothing
that
must
be
an
affair
of
business
in
which
we
have
very
greatly
the
advantage
of
them
euthyphro
and
do
you
imagine
socrates
that
any
benefit
accrues
to
the
gods
from
our
gifts
socrates
but
if
not
euthyphro
what
is
the
meaning
of
gifts
which
are
conferred
by
us
upon
the
gods
euthyphro
what
else
but
tributes
of
honour
and
as
i
was
just
now
saying
what
pleases
them
socrates
piety
then
is
pleasing
to
the
gods
but
not
beneficial
or
dear
to
them
euthyphro
i
should
say
that
nothing
could
be
dearer
socrates
then
once
more
the
assertion
is
repeated
that
piety
is
dear
to
the
gods
euthyphro
certainly
socrates
and
when
you
say
this
can
you
wonder
at
your
words
not
standing
firm
but
walking
away
will
you
accuse
me
of
being
the
daedalus
who
makes
them
walk
away
not
perceiving
that
there
is
another
and
far
greater
artist
than
daedalus
who
makes
them
go
round
in
a
circle
and
he
is
yourself
for
the
argument
as
you
will
perceive
comes
round
to
the
same
point
were
we
not
saying
that
the
holy
or
pious
was
not
the
same
with
that
which
is
loved
of
the
gods
have
you
forgotten
euthyphro
i
quite
remember
socrates
and
are
you
not
saying
that
what
is
loved
of
the
gods
is
holy
and
is
not
this
the
same
as
what
is
dear
to
them
do
you
see
euthyphro
true
socrates
then
either
we
were
wrong
in
our
former
assertion
or
if
we
were
right
then
we
are
wrong
now
euthyphro
one
of
the
two
must
be
true
socrates
then
we
must
begin
again
and
ask
what
is
piety
that
is
an
enquiry
which
i
shall
never
be
weary
of
pursuing
as
far
as
in
me
lies
and
i
entreat
you
not
to
scorn
me
but
to
apply
your
mind
to
the
utmost
and
tell
me
the
truth
for
if
any
man
knows
you
are
he
and
therefore
i
must
detain
you
like
proteus
until
you
tell
if
you
had
not
certainly
known
the
nature
of
piety
and
impiety
i
am
confident
that
you
would
never
on
behalf
of
a
serf
have
charged
your
aged
father
with
murder
you
would
not
have
run
such
a
risk
of
doing
wrong
in
the
sight
of
the
gods
and
you
would
have
had
too
much
respect
for
the
opinions
of
men
i
am
sure
therefore
that
you
know
the
nature
of
piety
and
impiety
speak
out
then
my
dear
euthyphro
and
do
not
hide
your
knowledge
euthyphro
another
time
socrates
for
i
am
in
a
hurry
and
must
go
now
socrates
alas
my
companion
and
will
you
leave
me
in
despair
i
was
hoping
that
you
would
instruct
me
in
the
nature
of
piety
and
impiety
and
then
i
might
have
cleared
myself
of
meletus
and
his
indictment
i
would
have
told
him
that
i
had
been
enlightened
by
euthyphro
and
had
given
up
rash
innovations
and
speculations
in
which
i
indulged
only
through
ignorance
and
that
now
i
am
about
to
lead
a
better
life
